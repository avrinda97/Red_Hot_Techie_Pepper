2010-10-07T14:53:00.000Z	iceroot	Syria	apt-cache search keylogger
2010-11-07T15:37:00.000Z	iceroot	Syria	esiest way is using ssh
2010-11-07T15:38:00.000Z	iceroot	Syria	if you want a real fast viewer for the x-server use nx, its the fastest thing out there :)
2010-11-07T15:38:00.000Z	iceroot	Syria	but nx cant append to a running session, nx is opening a new session
2010-11-07T15:38:00.000Z	Syria	iceroot	 Is it easy to use nx ?
2010-11-07T15:39:00.000Z	iceroot	Syria	its easy to use but not so easy to install :)
2010-11-07T15:40:00.000Z	Syria	iceroot	 Do you know where i can find a good guide for installing nx please?
2010-11-07T15:41:00.000Z	iceroot	Syria	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeNX
2010-11-07T15:41:00.000Z	iceroot	Syria	ssh -X is ok over the lan and very easy but the performance is not very nice. with ssh -X you can start x-applications from another machine on your pc
2011-08-14T14:21:00.000Z	iceroot	Syria	what is the ultimate edition?

2011-08-14T14:25:00.000Z	iceroot	Syria	normally not but having a backup is a good idea
2011-08-14T14:25:00.000Z	iceroot	Syria	also why you need to upgrade?
