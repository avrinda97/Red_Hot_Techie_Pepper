2006-09-18T10:37:00.000Z	Flannel	reggie10	what? the wiki does? or what
2006-09-18T10:38:00.000Z	Flannel	reggie10	no problem.  but, no file where?
2006-09-18T10:42:00.000Z	Flannel	reggie10	what firefox do you have installed? and which version of ubntu are you using?
2006-09-18T10:44:00.000Z	Flannel	reggie10	run firefox, go to the help/about page, and for your linux version, lsb_release -a
2006-09-18T10:46:00.000Z	Flannel	reggie10	right.  And, you're using Breezy?
2006-09-18T10:46:00.000Z	Flannel	reggie10	lsb_release -a
2006-09-18T10:47:00.000Z	Flannel	reggie10	preferrably ;)
2006-09-18T10:48:00.000Z	Flannel	reggie10	no need to paste, but yeah.  Alright, so, you just use that first command, not the second one (second is what you were using)
2006-09-18T10:49:00.000Z	Flannel	reggie10	no problem.  the second link would be if you had installed FF1.5, you need to do a bit more to get it working, which is why you don't have that file, because it isn't there
