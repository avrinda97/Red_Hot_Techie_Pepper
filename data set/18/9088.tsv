2007-05-12T05:15:00.000Z	Jowi	Znow	ubuntu need 1. root partition (I would recommend min 6GB) 2. swap (512MB -- 1GB should be enough) 3. /home (as much as you can spare
2007-05-12T05:16:00.000Z	Jowi	Znow	you can combine root and home but i would not recommend it in case you need to re-install/upgrade
2007-05-12T05:18:00.000Z	Jowi	Znow	root is the base system. swap is used for temporary storage. home is for your user files. I have 10GB for XP (that I never even use), 6GB for root, 512MB swap and 20GB for home. then I have an extra partition in case I need for 10GB. depends on your needs.
2007-05-12T05:19:00.000Z	Jowi	Znow	do you have many big apps/games for win?
2007-05-12T05:20:00.000Z	Jowi	Znow	so how about 30GB for win, 10GB for ubuntu root, 1GB for swap and the rest for home...?
2007-05-12T05:21:00.000Z	Jowi	Znow	you can even leave 10-20GB unused you know, in case you feel you need it for win or linux later. you don't need to fill the whole harddisk at once :)
2007-05-12T05:25:00.000Z	Jowi	Znow	boot into the ubuntu live cd and use gparted. it is quite similar to pqmagic.
2007-05-12T05:26:00.000Z	Znow	Jowi	ok
