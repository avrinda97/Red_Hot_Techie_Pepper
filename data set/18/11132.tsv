2007-10-06T08:36:00.000Z	kittyhawk		hi
2007-10-06T08:37:00.000Z	kittyhawk		I installed feisty on my laptop, and I turned on the desktop effects.  Everything works well except the root window is only drawing over about 2/3 of the screen
2007-10-06T08:37:00.000Z	kittyhawk		so there's a hall of mirrors over on the right
2007-10-06T08:37:00.000Z	kittyhawk		any ideas?
2007-10-06T08:39:00.000Z	kittyhawk		or at least, does anyone know where I can look for some good info?
2007-10-06T08:40:00.000Z	bascule	kittyhawk	tried changing wallpaper/refreshing desktop?
2007-10-06T08:41:00.000Z	kittyhawk	bascule	no good.  I turned on cube flipping and the cube is really a cube (not a rectangle)  I think for some reason it thinks my desktop size is square
2007-10-06T08:42:00.000Z	bascule	kittyhawk	interesting possibility
2007-10-06T08:43:00.000Z	bascule	kittyhawk	beryl or compiz-fusion?
2007-10-06T08:44:00.000Z	kittyhawk	bascule	I think compiz.  I just logged in and clicked "enable desktop effects"
2007-10-06T08:44:00.000Z	bascule	kittyhawk	OK, those are minor additions, try turning them back off and installing comiz-fusion + plugins
2007-10-06T08:45:00.000Z	bascule	kittyhawk	compiz I meant
2007-10-06T08:49:00.000Z	kittyhawk	bascule	dpkg-query says compiz and compiz-plugins are installed.  Do I need to do something to activate them?
2007-10-06T08:49:00.000Z	bascule	kittyhawk	alt+F2 -> compiz
2007-10-06T08:51:00.000Z	kittyhawk	bascule	I ran compiz --replace at the command line, same story only a fraction of the background is drawn
2007-10-06T08:51:00.000Z	bascule	kittyhawk	then I am baffled
2007-10-06T09:20:00.000Z	kittyhawk	bascule	I found a bug report that suggested changing the depth to 16, which worked.  Thanks for your help though
2007-10-06T09:21:00.000Z	bascule	kittyhawk	welcome, thanks for the info
