2007-09-28T07:13:00.000Z	kitche	reya276	this ist eh easy thing /proc/config.gz see if you have that file with if not you can find one in the repos most likely from the source
2007-09-28T07:14:00.000Z	kitche	reya276	do you have a config.gz in /proc or no?
2007-09-28T07:15:00.000Z	kitche	reya276	proc is in /
2007-09-28T07:18:00.000Z	kitche	reya276	ok does /boot have any config files in it I can't remember if it does or not

2007-09-28T07:20:00.000Z	kitche	reya276	do you see the -generic config file?
2007-09-28T07:23:00.000Z	reya276	kitche	in /boot there is a file called "config-2.6.20-16-generic"
2007-09-28T07:24:00.000Z	kitche	reya276	yes you want that file put in the folder of the .23-rc8 gonna use that config to get you started it's a sort of fast way to get a kernel working fast
