2006-03-16T17:07:00.000Z	Steve^		Is there actually a way to get wmv files running in a web browser (Opera or even just Firefox) within Ubuntu? Or should I stop looking?
2006-03-16T17:07:00.000Z	nickrud	Steve^	install totem-xine & the w32codecs, works for most people

2006-04-04T11:07:00.000Z	Steve^	nickrud	I think that's what I used with suse, but i'm trying to avoid using kde stuff in gnome
