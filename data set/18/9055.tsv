2007-05-18T10:16:00.000Z	monaleilani		It doesn't even install ndiswrapper. How the heck am I supposed to download ndiswrapper if I don't have an internet connection?
2007-05-18T10:16:00.000Z	monaleilani		I'm rapidly becoming disenchanted with ubuntu.
2007-05-18T10:17:00.000Z	monaleilani		I might actually degrade, because at least then I could connect to the internet.
2007-05-18T10:17:00.000Z	monaleilani		This is pathetic.
2007-05-18T10:17:00.000Z	RAOF	monaleilani	ndiswrapper is on both the live & alternate CDs, last time I checked.
2007-05-18T10:18:00.000Z	RAOF	monaleilani	Not installed by default, but installable without an internet connection.
2007-05-18T10:22:00.000Z	RAOF	monaleilani	apt-get install ndiswrapper-utils ?
2007-05-18T10:24:00.000Z	RAOF	monaleilani	You probably need ndiswrapper-utils-1.8 or something.
2007-05-18T10:25:00.000Z	RAOF	monaleilani	If you're using a Feisty livecd, make that ndiswrapper-utils-1.9
2007-05-18T10:27:00.000Z	RAOF	monaleilani	In fact, you might want to check the ndiswrapper wiki page:     *
2007-05-18T10:27:00.000Z	RAOF	monaleilani	In fact, you might want to check the ndiswrapper wiki page:           Without an Internet connection, you can still install ndiswrapper-utils from the Desktop CD. If you installed from that, the repository in which ndiswrapper-utils is found is on the CD, but not within the live session. You need to boot into your new Ubuntu installation and then reinsert the Desktop CD. You will be asked if you want to add the packages on the CD ...
2007-05-18T10:28:00.000Z	RAOF	monaleilani	Ok, I'll just write out the address: help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/Ndiswrapper
2007-05-18T10:29:00.000Z	monaleilani	RAOF	The first time I stuck my cd in on my new installation, sure, it asked me if I wanted to add it. I clicked yes. But lo and behold, that has done me jack shit.;
2007-05-18T10:33:00.000Z	RAOF	monaleilani	It's hidden as *ndiswrapper-utils-1.9*
2007-05-18T10:34:00.000Z	RAOF	monaleilani	If you've got the CD added as a repository, you *should* just be able to apt-get install ndiswrapper-utils-1.9
2007-05-18T10:34:00.000Z	RAOF	monaleilani	Otherwise, there'll be the .deb of it lying around on the CD somewhere.  You could "find / -iname *.deb"
2007-05-18T10:54:00.000Z	RAOF	monaleilani	That's quite true.  It looks like you need to use the alternate cd, which is a bit strange.
2007-05-18T10:55:00.000Z	RAOF	monaleilani	You are.
