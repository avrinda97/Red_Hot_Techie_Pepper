2007-09-19T10:54:00.000Z	leladia		that is not a problem
2007-09-19T10:54:00.000Z	bulmer	leladia	any user can cat /etc/passwd
2007-09-19T10:55:00.000Z	leladia	bulmer	yes
2007-09-19T10:56:00.000Z	bulmer	leladia	use awk to tokenize each field and print only ones you like
2007-09-19T10:56:00.000Z	leladia	bulmer	is awk an option?
2007-09-19T10:57:00.000Z	bulmer	leladia	man awk
2007-09-19T10:57:00.000Z	leladia	bulmer	thanks
2007-09-19T11:00:00.000Z	bulmer	leladia	something like this  awk -F: '{print $1, $3 }' /etc/passwd
2007-09-28T08:53:00.000Z	bulmer	leladia	you cp it to destination
