2006-06-02T14:23:00.000Z	Flannel	Fujitsu	he doens't need dist upgrade.
2006-06-02T14:23:00.000Z	Fujitsu	Flannel	yes he does!
2006-06-04T07:15:00.000Z	Flannel	Fujitsu	does the Server LAMP option install perl as well?
2006-06-04T07:15:00.000Z	Fujitsu	Flannel	no.
2006-06-09T13:55:00.000Z	Fujitsu	Flannel	I don't think there are any issues with that.
2006-06-09T13:55:00.000Z	Flannel	Fujitsu	I wouldn't think so either.

2006-06-10T15:32:00.000Z	Fujitsu	Flannel	it's not really necessary, but I guess it looks nice...
2006-06-10T15:32:00.000Z	Flannel	Fujitsu	it's better to be safe, all graphical programs gksudo, so you don't FUBAR your system
2006-06-10T15:32:00.000Z	Fujitsu	Flannel	the only things that break things are Qt apps.
2006-06-10T15:33:00.000Z	Flannel	Fujitsu	like I said, it's better to run ALL graphical programs as gksudo.  Just like we don't tell them to run as root.
2007-03-26T10:47:00.000Z	Flannel	Fujitsu	he already said the server CD doesn't work.  Which doesn't supriseme.  He needs the Alt. CD
