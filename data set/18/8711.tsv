2007-07-07T16:58:00.000Z	jenda	vinneh	I have this thing with ignoring beeps in this channel because they are usually !ops :D
2007-07-07T05:00:00.000Z	jenda	vinneh	I'm in gnome... but the keyring manager doesn't seem to do anything.
2007-07-07T05:03:00.000Z	vinneh	jenda	what happenst if you type gpg --list-keys
2007-07-07T05:09:00.000Z	jenda	vinneh	well, it lists all the keys, of course :D
2007-07-07T05:09:00.000Z	jenda	vinneh	it's not that, it's the thing that fills in the passwords in all the gpg and ssh prompts that pop up that I need to set up right. It's a gnome thing.
