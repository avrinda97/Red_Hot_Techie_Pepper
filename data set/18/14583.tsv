2005-07-11T11:01:00.000Z	peet	Harold	use "#iwlist scanning"
2005-07-11T11:01:00.000Z	Harold	peet	Thank you.  That's my next project, figuring out how to configure my wireless adapter.
2005-07-11T11:01:00.000Z	peet	Harold	:) if you have centrino its real easy
2005-07-11T11:02:00.000Z	Harold	peet	I'm using a D-Link card on my powerbook
2005-07-11T11:02:00.000Z	peet	Harold	can't say about dlink but it hink they are nix friendly
2005-07-11T11:02:00.000Z	peet	Harold	you can always use ndiswrapper for unsupported wireless cards
2005-07-11T11:02:00.000Z	Harold	peet	I think this card will work; it's worked for other linuxheads
2005-07-11T11:03:00.000Z	peet	Harold	what model is it
2005-07-11T11:03:00.000Z	Harold	peet	Exactly; I've read that ndiswrapper works
2005-07-11T11:03:00.000Z	Harold	peet	D-Link DWL-G630
2005-07-11T11:03:00.000Z	peet	Harold	well ndiswrapper is just emulating the windows driver
2005-07-11T11:03:00.000Z	peet	Harold	er running the windows driver in linux
2005-07-11T11:03:00.000Z	Harold	peet	I'll have to figure out how to get ndiswrapper working, next.
2005-07-11T11:04:00.000Z	peet	Harold	and then get cpufreqd working too :)
2005-07-11T11:04:00.000Z	peet	Harold	you might have to build support for it in teh kernel
