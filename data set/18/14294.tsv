2005-08-24T13:20:00.000Z	ifr		Hi, what was the way to see what programs are using a particular mounted drive, if you want to umount and get the message that it's busy?
2005-08-24T13:20:00.000Z	chicken_	ifr	fs ?
2005-08-24T13:21:00.000Z	ifr	chicken_	sorry, uh, what?
2005-08-24T13:21:00.000Z	chicken_	ifr	type fs in a terminal
2005-08-24T13:21:00.000Z	ifr		The  drive I'm trying to umount is a samba fs drive
2005-08-24T13:21:00.000Z	ifr		Ah.
2005-08-24T13:21:00.000Z	ifr		nick@un1-dosa:~$ sudo fs
2005-08-24T13:21:00.000Z	ifr		command not found
2005-08-24T13:22:00.000Z	chicken_	ifr	errrm i know it's some thing like that
2005-08-24T13:22:00.000Z	ifr		are you thinking of df?
2005-08-24T13:22:00.000Z	ifr		That's not the problem - I know what's mounted, I want to know what's using it.
2005-08-24T13:23:00.000Z	chicken_	ifr	ahh yea thats it
2005-08-24T13:23:00.000Z	ifr		Yes, that wasn't it though, as far as what I needed. Anyone? like a top to show what's using a particular drive? I ps au 'd it but nada
