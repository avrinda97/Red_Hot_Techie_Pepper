2012-04-08T02:58:00.000Z	eertre		you really dont want to pay atention to my problem, because if u read carefuly u will understand what i am saying
2012-04-08T02:59:00.000Z	eertre		where or when can i do that
2012-04-08T02:59:00.000Z	eertre		no, u dont want to listen to me, serious ... can i private you?
2012-04-08T03:00:00.000Z	eertre		when u choose ERASE WINDOWS, i have no option to format or partitioning harddisk
2012-04-08T03:01:00.000Z	eertre		so when i choose ERASE WINDOWS, it will FORMAT and RE-PARTITION my harddisk on his own choose?
2012-04-08T03:03:00.000Z	eertre		you probably read, but u didnt wanted to talk in many words so u can give ma complete response :pp
2012-04-08T03:04:00.000Z	eertre		lol ...
2012-04-08T03:05:00.000Z	eertre		so the swap will be 4 GB, and the rest will be formated in ext4 ?!
2012-04-08T03:06:00.000Z	eertre		so this way i will only have 2 partitions ?!
2012-04-08T03:07:00.000Z	blz	eertre	by default, Ubuntu will create two partitions:  /  and swap
2012-04-08T03:10:00.000Z	blz	eertre	what exactly are you trying to do?
2012-04-08T03:12:00.000Z	eertre	blz	i have a hard of 750 GB with win 7 on it ... i want to format it all ( ALL ALL - i dont need anything, including windows) and i want to install a fresh copy of ubuntu .. my hard has 3 partitions ... C with 350 D with 200 and E with 150 .. woulnd be good to keep this way of partitioning also in ubuntu ? if yes, how do i do it ?! this was my question
2012-04-08T03:12:00.000Z	blz	eertre	have you used linux or ubuntu before?
2012-04-08T03:13:00.000Z	blz	eertre	Okay, so I'll start with the question "is this a good way of partitioning ubuntu".  The answer to that is "it doesn't sound bad, but it depends on what you want to do"
2012-04-08T03:15:00.000Z	blz	eertre	fair enough.  In that case, you'll want to name your system partition "/" (without the quotes)
2012-04-08T03:16:00.000Z	blz	eertre	i'll pm you so we don't flood the living hell out of this channel
2012-04-08T03:16:00.000Z	eertre	blz	please d
