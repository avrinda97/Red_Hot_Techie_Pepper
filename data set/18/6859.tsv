2009-04-09T21:36:00.000Z	schmichael		somehow an acer utility managed to mess up my linux partitions which have an encrypted /home and swap.  gparted in only reporting 2 partitions where linux should be: one is "unallocated", the other is "unknown"
2009-04-09T21:36:00.000Z	schmichael		is my data lost?
2009-04-09T21:37:00.000Z	schmichael		i'm trying to use cryptsetup to access the "unallocated" partition but it just says the key isn't found (and i know the password is correct)
2009-04-09T21:39:00.000Z	sipior	schmichael	probably not, but what was the acer utility supposed to do? one thing you should probably do from the start is to image the partition with your data on it. once that data is secure, check out the "testdisk" utility, and see if it can restore a sensible partition table.
2009-04-09T21:40:00.000Z	schmichael	sipior	i exited the utility without doing anything but now get a grub 15 error on boot (no menu displayed, SGD can't find anything)
2009-04-09T21:40:00.000Z	sipior	schmichael	well, guess it must have done something, yeah? :-)
2009-04-09T21:40:00.000Z	sipior	schmichael	but what was the purpose in running the program?
2009-04-09T21:40:00.000Z	schmichael	sipior	ha, exactly.  no clue what though!  does test disk support encrypted volumes?
2009-04-09T21:41:00.000Z	schmichael	sipior	it was an accident, i tried to boot vista (for the first time) but it booted that utility instead
2009-04-09T21:41:00.000Z	schmichael	sipior	grub had 2 vista options, i chose the first
2009-04-09T21:41:00.000Z	sipior	schmichael	it should be able to restore the partition table, so that you can then mount the volume from the live cd, and access your encrypted data in the normal fashion.
2009-04-09T21:42:00.000Z	schmichael	sipior	trying test disk now, thanks
2009-04-09T22:07:00.000Z	schmichael	sipior	testdisk is doing a deepsearch on my system but i don't know... i just have my 2 vista partitions, 1 extended partition which should contain /, /home (encrypted), and swap (encrypted) ... but its only showing the extended partition and the swap partition inside it :(
2009-04-09T22:09:00.000Z	sipior	schmichael	it finished and couldn't locate the partition boundary for the other two?
2009-04-09T22:10:00.000Z	sipior	schmichael	is the swap partition between the root and home partitions?
2009-04-09T22:11:00.000Z	sipior	schmichael	in other words, can you just read off the beginning and ending cylinder numbers that way?
2009-04-09T22:12:00.000Z	sipior	schmichael	you could use fdisk to explicitly set the partition begin and end points. if these *precisely match* with what's really on disk, you should then be able to mount the partitions normally.
2009-04-09T22:29:00.000Z	schmichael	sipior	it finished and i accidentally hit enter, so now i have to rescan >.<
