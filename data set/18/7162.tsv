2008-02-03T15:41:00.000Z	L3ttuc3	Seveas	would you be as rigid about capitalisation too?
2008-02-03T15:43:00.000Z	L3ttuc3	Seveas	if you're going to enforce something like proper spelling of pronouns, wouldn't the same logic apply to capitalisation, etc?
2008-02-03T15:44:00.000Z	L3ttuc3	Seveas	mind you, i'm just interested in finding out what your point of view is. sorry for offtopic.
2008-02-03T15:45:00.000Z	Seveas	L3ttuc3	the !u factoid is about keeping the channel understandable for non-native-english speakers, yes, same goes for punctuation. Capitalization doesn't necessari;y impact understandability, eXcePT wheN USeD lIKe ThiS

2008-02-03T15:48:00.000Z	L3ttuc3	Seveas	fair enough. sorry about offtopic again.
2008-02-03T15:49:00.000Z	Seveas	L3ttuc3	nemilar: and if you wouldn't have made such a fuss he would have been unbanned already. He has apologized already
