2005-11-03T16:18:00.000Z	asimismo		Ok, does nobody use LVM and RAID?
2005-11-03T16:19:00.000Z	anto9us	asimismo	I reconfigured mine in the installer, worked ok, you can try using parted or a gui version like gparted or qtparted
2005-11-03T16:20:00.000Z	asimismo	anto9us	I can't boot. I want to reinstall but I can't clear out the old settings, even via the installer.
2005-11-03T16:22:00.000Z	anto9us	asimismo	installer cleared out old raid settings for me, was a bit troublesomet though, keep trying
2005-11-03T16:22:00.000Z	asimismo	anto9us	Oh, I have! Try to clear settings. Error. Reboot. Try again.
2005-11-03T16:23:00.000Z	anto9us	asimismo	what's the error?
2005-11-03T16:25:00.000Z	asimismo	anto9us	Currently 'The ext3 file system creation in partition #1 of IDE1 master (hda) failed.
2005-11-03T16:27:00.000Z	anto9us	asimismo	you should be adding the ext3 to the raid device md0 or whatever
2005-11-03T16:28:00.000Z	asimismo	anto9us	If I try to do guided partitioning to overwrite everything it says, 'Error informing the kernel about modifications to partiion ...part5 - Device or resource busy.'
2005-11-03T16:28:00.000Z	asimismo	anto9us	I'm just trying a simple install hoping to overwrite the md and lvm data. Because it keeps remembering my previous settings
2005-11-03T16:30:00.000Z	anto9us	asimismo	have you checked for and deleted the md?
2005-11-03T16:32:00.000Z	anto9us	asimismo	I confess I've no experience of LVM, only RAID
2005-11-03T16:35:00.000Z	anto9us	asimismo	have you got a live cd?
2005-11-03T16:36:00.000Z	asimismo	anto9us	Oh, that's an n. Sorry, bad font!
2005-11-03T16:37:00.000Z	anto9us	asimismo	boot off that and try parted
2005-11-03T16:37:00.000Z	asimismo	anto9us	parted is an app?
2005-11-03T16:38:00.000Z	anto9us	asimismo	yes, it gives partition information and editing
2005-11-03T16:38:00.000Z	asimismo	anto9us	Thanks! Gotta run...
