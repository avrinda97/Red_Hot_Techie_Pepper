2008-11-14T04:55:00.000Z	greghere		when installing Ubuntu, and at the partitioning stage, whats the difference between "/" and "/boot" ?
2008-11-14T04:56:00.000Z	boskoop	greghere	/ ist the root partition, which means that root is mounted there
2008-11-14T04:56:00.000Z	greghere	boskoop	What if I used /boot?
2008-11-14T04:56:00.000Z	boskoop	greghere	if you want to add a sepparate partition for your boot-files you can add a /boot partition
2008-11-14T04:57:00.000Z	boskoop	greghere	you always need a / (root) partition
2008-11-14T04:57:00.000Z	greghere		so I could use /boot for boot files, / for linux install and /home formy stuff?
2008-11-14T04:58:00.000Z	boskoop	greghere	/root partition is optional
2008-11-14T04:58:00.000Z	boskoop	greghere	right
2008-11-14T04:58:00.000Z	greghere	boskoop	so if I used /boot and /home all would be ok?
2008-11-14T04:59:00.000Z	boskoop	greghere	i use /boot for my boot files too (size 100MB)
2008-11-14T04:59:00.000Z	boskoop		nope
2008-11-14T04:59:00.000Z	boskoop		you absolutely need a / partition
2008-11-14T05:00:00.000Z	greghere	boskoop	so there would be no advantage to have /boot, /, and /home? I should just have / and /home?
2008-11-14T05:01:00.000Z	boskoop	greghere	advantage is if you want to use an exotic file system on / which isn't supported by grub
2008-11-14T05:02:00.000Z	greghere	boskoop	Ahh! all makeing sense now, thank you very much :-)
2008-11-14T05:02:00.000Z	boskoop	greghere	but if you are using ext3 there is nearly no advantage using a sepparate /boot paritition
2008-11-14T05:02:00.000Z	boskoop		np!
2008-11-14T05:04:00.000Z	greghere	boskoop	yes I always use EXT3, as everything I learned about file systems seems to indicate that this is the best all round for average joe's like me :-)
