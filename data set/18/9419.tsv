2007-04-14T12:57:00.000Z	Manny	Juancab	what do you mean by "recover"?
2007-04-14T12:57:00.000Z	Manny		is the virtual machine functional ATM?
2007-04-14T12:57:00.000Z	Manny	Juancab	you're referring to VMWare here, right?
2007-04-14T12:58:00.000Z	Juancab	Manny	yes VMware
2007-04-14T12:58:00.000Z	Juancab		I mean: My ubuntu doesn't start, so i've decided to re-install it, but I want to backup my work
2007-04-14T12:58:00.000Z	Juancab	Manny	 I mean: My ubuntu doesn't start, so i've decided to re-install it, but I want to backup my work
2007-04-14T12:59:00.000Z	Manny	Juancab	why doesn't it boot? Where does it hang?
2007-04-14T13:00:00.000Z	Manny	Juancab	I'm not sure whether that is possible, i.e. whether you can pretend that the virtual disk is a hard disk-like block device or something
2007-04-14T13:00:00.000Z	Juancab	Manny	It lets me select the session, I mean the login screen, but then it gaves me a message about the session lasting less than 10 seconds
2007-04-14T13:00:00.000Z	Manny	Juancab	you're didn't tell us whether it's the underlying virtual machine that doesn't boot or whether it's the host system
2007-04-14T13:01:00.000Z	Juancab	Manny	the host system: ubuntu
2007-04-14T13:01:00.000Z	Manny	Juancab	why don't you login in safe mode (terminal-only, not GNOME)?
2007-04-14T13:01:00.000Z	Manny		you can then look at ~/.xsession-errors for the issue
2007-04-14T13:01:00.000Z	Manny		did you install any new software?
2007-04-14T13:02:00.000Z	Manny		"new" as of "unpackaged"?
2007-04-14T13:02:00.000Z	Juancab	Manny	How do I open  ~/.xsession-errors then?
