2009-07-12T12:23:00.000Z	howie		what kinda of progams are there for remote desktop in ubuntu?
2009-07-12T12:24:00.000Z	grawity	howie	VNC, RDP (Remote Desktop), and X over SSH (this one is probably not what you want).
2009-07-12T12:24:00.000Z	howie	grawity	 vnc works in linux?
2009-07-12T12:24:00.000Z	grawity	howie	of course it does.
2009-07-12T12:25:00.000Z	grawity	howie	are you connecting *from* Linux, or *to* Linux?
2009-07-12T12:26:00.000Z	grawity	howie	then try VNC first. (there is a Remote Desktop server too)
2009-07-12T12:27:00.000Z	howie	grawity	vnc wouldnt happen to be in the package manager?
2009-07-12T12:28:00.000Z	grawity	howie	yeah, apt-cache search vnc -- I think GNOME uses 'vino' by default.
