2011-03-29T04:52:00.000Z	tbruff13	Mad_HaTTer	windows and mac users can connect to the school internet is their anyway to make the wireless network think i am a windows computer and no there is no error it just asks for password over and over and over even though i know its right
2011-03-29T04:53:00.000Z	Mad_HaTTer	tbruff13	your password that you know is right did you check caps and numlock?
2011-03-29T04:54:00.000Z	tbruff13	Mad_HaTTer	yes
2011-03-29T04:57:00.000Z	Mad_HaTTer	tbruff13	if thats what its doing its one of 3 things password problem, input method problem, or encryption problem
