2009-08-26T18:22:00.000Z	aethelrick	aaron11	first make sure you actually have python in your path. Type "which python" into the console and press enter
2009-08-26T18:22:00.000Z	aethelrick	aaron11	tell us what you get back
2009-08-26T18:23:00.000Z	aethelrick	aaron11	once you have done that, make sure you are in the right directory, type "ls" into the console and verify you can see the file you are trying to execute
2009-08-26T18:23:00.000Z	aaron11	aethelrick	ive tried dir and the file name is under it
2009-08-26T18:24:00.000Z	aethelrick	aaron11	then carefully type "python <yourscript>" where <yourscript> is the name of the script you are trying to execute. Note that this is case sensitive.
2009-08-26T18:25:00.000Z	aethelrick	aaron11	 any output you see on the console will be from the script or from the python interpreter if the script has errors in it that cause it to fail
2009-08-26T18:26:00.000Z	aaron11	aethelrick	i ran the squareroot file in the python idle (shel) and it works just as my brain does
2009-08-26T18:26:00.000Z	aaron11	aethelrick	i ran the squareroot file in the python idle (shel) and it works just as my brain does which means it works like fine
