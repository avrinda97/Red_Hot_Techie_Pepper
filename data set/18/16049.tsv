2004-11-25T07:17:00.000Z	Tsjoklat		I don't think so
2004-11-25T07:17:00.000Z	Tsjoklat		they probably going to remove it all together at one time
2004-11-25T07:17:00.000Z	Tsjoklat		but perhaps gamin is not bug free enough to run on it's own
2004-11-25T07:18:00.000Z	Tsjoklat		you got problems in Nautilus Nap?
2004-11-25T07:19:00.000Z	Tsjoklat		Nap it will eventually replace fam yes.... but it is something they want done by the time Hoary releases.. and that is in april
2004-11-25T07:19:00.000Z	Tsjoklat		so we got a few months ahead of us :)
