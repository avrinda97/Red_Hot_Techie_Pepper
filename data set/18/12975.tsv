2007-05-17T07:36:00.000Z	dfgas		how do i get more than one program to play sounds using alsa?
2007-05-17T07:36:00.000Z	dfgas		or anything for that matter
2007-05-17T07:37:00.000Z	Frogzoo	dfgas	feisty should just do it
2007-05-17T07:43:00.000Z	dfgas	Frogzoo	its not  :(
2007-05-17T07:44:00.000Z	Frogzoo	dfgas	something's configured wrongly to use OSS - set everything to use ALSA
2007-05-17T07:44:00.000Z	dfgas	Frogzoo	if i have gaim up and then try to play a mp3 in xmms it will say failed to output to alsa, if i play xmms in oss i can hear the sound but then i can't hear the sound from gaim
2007-05-17T07:46:00.000Z	dfgas	Frogzoo	now that i have all gnome sound configured to alsa now gaim or xmms will work
2007-05-17T07:46:00.000Z	Frogzoo	dfgas	should do
2007-05-17T07:46:00.000Z	dfgas	Frogzoo	any idea how to fix
2007-05-17T08:33:00.000Z	Frogzoo	dfgas	sound -> volume control -> file -> change device -> ALSA mixer & check settings
2007-05-17T08:33:00.000Z	dfgas	Frogzoo	done all that
2007-05-17T08:34:00.000Z	Frogzoo	dfgas	do you have a ~/.asoundrc ? if so, remove it, restart
2007-05-17T08:35:00.000Z	dfgas	Frogzoo	no
2007-05-17T08:36:00.000Z	Frogzoo	dfgas	this is feisty?
2007-05-17T08:36:00.000Z	dfgas	Frogzoo	yes it is
2007-05-17T08:38:00.000Z	Frogzoo	dfgas	sound -> volume control -> file -> change device -> OSS mixer & turn PCM2 right up
2007-05-17T09:14:00.000Z	dfgas	Frogzoo	i got it fixed now by the help of some one from alsa
2007-05-17T09:14:00.000Z	dfgas	Frogzoo	it was a mixing issue
