2010-11-26T13:28:00.000Z	lea123		Hi Is Ubuntu Tweak a reliable program ?
2010-11-26T13:28:00.000Z	ferris_	lea123	 reliable? It works well.
2010-11-26T13:29:00.000Z	ferris_	lea123	it makes some configurations very easy. I think it is worth the resources.
2010-11-26T13:30:00.000Z	ferris_		has anyone had a problem with linux kernel 2.6.36 in ubuntu?
2010-11-26T13:30:00.000Z	lea123		Ferris : I am downloading from http://ubuntu-tweak.com/ I though Ubuntu Software resource would have it, but it doesn't .
2010-11-26T13:31:00.000Z	ferris_	lea123	it does a lot like automatically installing bin files.
2010-11-26T13:38:00.000Z	lea123	ferris_	Does Ubuntu Tweak take the role of Ubuntu Software Centre as well ??
2010-11-26T13:39:00.000Z	ferris_	lea123	 no it is very different
2010-11-26T13:40:00.000Z	ferris_	lea123	 it does not install software but configures it... though it will activate some things that it needs
2010-11-26T13:40:00.000Z	ferris_		have you installed it?
2010-11-26T13:40:00.000Z	lea123	ferris_	I can see its given me a catergory of softwares - OH OK
2010-11-26T13:40:00.000Z	lea123		Yes
2010-11-26T13:42:00.000Z	lea123	ferris_	I am afraid I think the newer version might be different. I have a feeling it checks whether the current installs have any updates.. Am I right ?
2010-11-26T13:44:00.000Z	ferris_	lea123	 check out this page: http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2010/10/10-things-to-do-after-installing-ubuntu-10-10-maverick-meerkat/  this is where I got mine.
2010-11-26T13:45:00.000Z	ferris_	lea123	 there are some good things to consider to do.
2010-11-26T13:48:00.000Z	lea123	ferris_	What do I  need to do in order to get the preview of the images/docs on when I try to open/save files ..
2010-11-26T13:50:00.000Z	ferris_	lea123	 I am not sure what you mean
2010-11-26T13:56:00.000Z	lea123	ferris_	See when you if you right click and choose save image, it would bring up a dialog box named  "save image". However this dialog box seems very primitive it does'nt have any preview options
