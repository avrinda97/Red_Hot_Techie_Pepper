2011-06-21T01:49:00.000Z	lafon		sometimes to grub cli
2011-06-21T01:49:00.000Z	lafon		mboard or card?
2011-06-21T01:50:00.000Z	lafon		what i mean is that the comp will boot
2011-06-21T01:50:00.000Z	lafon		get to said stage then restart
2011-06-21T01:50:00.000Z	lafon		only happens with non-integrated cards
2011-06-21T01:51:00.000Z	lafon		but I tried 2 cards
2011-06-21T01:51:00.000Z	lafon		oh
2011-06-21T01:51:00.000Z	lafon		maybe. ill try moving my hdd and card over to a different mboard and see if that works
2011-06-21T01:52:00.000Z	lafon		one video card needs external power the other not. so probably not
2011-06-21T01:53:00.000Z	lafon		I'll try my "solution". if that doesnt work i can always complain to...someone. :P
2011-06-21T01:54:00.000Z	BluesKaj	lafon	you might consider the aleternate install if you have HW probs with a rekular install
2011-06-21T01:55:00.000Z	lafon	BluesKaj	I'd rather just get a different m'board. its too much hassle to get dial-up working again
2011-06-21T01:56:00.000Z	BluesKaj	lafon	mobo change , doubtful that will help
2011-06-21T01:56:00.000Z	lafon		Blueskaj, Why?
2011-06-21T01:57:00.000Z	BluesKaj		you'll have to reinstall due to HW changes, lafon
2011-06-21T01:58:00.000Z	lafon		not really a problem. i have some really wierd stuff on my edition of ubuntu
2011-06-21T01:59:00.000Z	BluesKaj	lafon	well good luck , but keep the alternate in mind
2011-06-21T02:00:00.000Z	lafon	BluesKaj	thanks and I'll see. i just don't relish the idea of killing my phone for a week just to get a videocard to work 'cause i want to watch a movie or play a game
