2006-12-18T06:18:00.000Z	eps	mneptok	I only retaliated; which if some one is abusive to me first I reserve the right to.  Though I will restrain myself if it happens again tonight
2006-12-18T06:20:00.000Z	mneptok	eps	we reserve the right to remove abusive people from the channel, whether they "started it" or not. ;)
2006-12-18T06:20:00.000Z	eps	mneptok	then if you stick by the policy in place there wont be a need for me to retaliate against any abusive parties
