2004-11-22T14:32:00.000Z	ironwolf		Using a Synaptics Touch Pad on a Sager notebook, the buttons work, but touching the pad does not left click.  Any clues how to remedy?
2004-11-22T14:32:00.000Z	sladen	ironwolf	left click by tapping it
2004-11-22T14:33:00.000Z	sladen	ironwolf	is that what you mean?
2004-11-22T14:33:00.000Z	ironwolf	sladen	yes, and it's not currently working.
2004-11-22T14:36:00.000Z	sladen	ironwolf	do you have left/right buttons aswell?
2004-11-22T14:36:00.000Z	ironwolf	sladen	yes, and they work well.
2004-11-22T14:37:00.000Z	sladen	ironwolf	so it's just the 'tapping' that doesn't?
2004-11-22T14:37:00.000Z	ironwolf	sladen	correct.
2004-11-22T14:44:00.000Z	ironwolf	sladen	any ideas?
2004-11-22T14:44:00.000Z	sladen	ironwolf	I googled for  synaptics configure tap  and you need to set MaxTapTime to something non-zero.  I've no idea where though
2004-11-22T14:45:00.000Z	ironwolf	sladen	thanks, I'll poke around for it.
2004-11-22T14:46:00.000Z	sladen	ironwolf	I'm not sure whether the kernel drivers are being used, or the XF ones
2004-11-22T14:51:00.000Z	sladen	ironwolf	try  synclient
2004-11-22T14:52:00.000Z	ironwolf	sladen	what's synclient ?
2004-11-22T14:55:00.000Z	sladen	ironwolf	it appears to might be the tool to configure the synaptics!
2004-11-22T15:00:00.000Z	ironwolf	sladen	running synclient I get "Can't access shared memory area. SHMConfig disabled?" where's SHMConfig set ?
2004-11-22T15:00:00.000Z	sladen	ironwolf	there's a bug about it.  2153  (where I found the reference to synclient)
2004-11-22T15:05:00.000Z	ironwolf	sladen	many thanks.
