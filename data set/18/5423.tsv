2008-12-13T15:36:00.000Z	imachine		could someone tell me the difference between LTS and non-LTS releases ?
2008-12-13T15:36:00.000Z	imachine		is, for example, 8.10 less 'stable' than 8.04 ?
2008-12-13T15:36:00.000Z	imachine		what's the point of LTS in general ?
2008-12-13T15:37:00.000Z	robb_m	imachine	longer support periods....

2008-12-13T15:37:00.000Z	imachine	robb_m	well, what do I get from such support then ?
2008-12-13T15:38:00.000Z	imachine	robb_m	I never had a Linux distro with support.
2008-12-13T15:38:00.000Z	robb_m	imachine	you get us obviously, then you can get forum support, and canonical phone support.
