2005-11-18T07:16:00.000Z	dnB		can someone help me out? im trying to setup iptables, using a tutorial that says to type "iptables-save > /etc/sysconfig/iptables" however that isnt working
2005-11-18T07:18:00.000Z	dnB		ok thanks bob2 ill go rtfm ;)
2005-11-18T07:18:00.000Z	dooglus	dnB	dnB what error so you see?
2005-11-18T08:52:00.000Z	dooglus	dnB	did you see that?  run your webfilter from /etc/init.d/bootmisc.sh
2005-11-18T08:53:00.000Z	dnB	dooglus	thanks ;)
2005-11-18T08:56:00.000Z	dnB	dooglus	apparently its already in init.d, however it seems it loads before squid, which causes it to close down, know how i can change the boot order? so i can have it boot after squid?
2005-11-18T08:59:00.000Z	dooglus	dnB	you can edit the file and add stuff to it.  the numbers tell you the boot order.  look in /etc/rc2.d
2005-11-18T08:59:00.000Z	dnB	dooglus	thanks ;)
2005-11-18T08:59:00.000Z	dooglus	dnB	and from what I remember, bootmisc.sh is one of the last things to run - after squid I should think
2005-11-18T09:00:00.000Z	dnB	dooglus	according to this squid is s30 and dansguardian is s50.. so it should already be in the correct order/
2005-11-18T09:00:00.000Z	dooglus	dnB	right.
2005-11-18T09:01:00.000Z	dnB	dooglus	guess its some other problem then :) thanks
2005-11-18T09:01:00.000Z	dooglus	dnB	if you rename the s50 to a k50, it won't run.  then you can run it from bootmisc.sh instead
2005-11-18T09:01:00.000Z	dooglus	dnB	's' for 'start', 'k' for 'kill'
2005-11-18T09:01:00.000Z	dnB	dooglus	ahh ;)
2005-11-18T09:02:00.000Z	dnB	dooglus	would you mind if i pmed you?
2005-11-18T09:02:00.000Z	dooglus	dnB	you can try :)  you need to have your nick registered or it won't let you
2005-11-18T09:02:00.000Z	dooglus	dnB	and I draw the line at cybersex
