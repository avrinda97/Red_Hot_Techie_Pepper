2005-09-20T08:35:00.000Z	sportman		i love ubuntu, but i feel so limited by its packages
2005-09-20T08:35:00.000Z	sportman		n e suggestions
2005-09-20T08:35:00.000Z	sportman		or restricted
2005-09-20T08:37:00.000Z	zdennis	sportman	portage === gentoo?
2005-09-20T08:40:00.000Z	zdennis	sportman	yes that is kind of odd
2005-09-20T08:41:00.000Z	zdennis	sportman	that seems really weird, because it is your BIOS that is in charge of allowing you to boot from external devices
2005-09-20T08:42:00.000Z	zdennis	sportman	it *isn't * the installer
2005-09-20T08:43:00.000Z	zdennis	sportman	what you are saying doesn't make any logical sense.
2005-09-20T08:44:00.000Z	zdennis	sportman	the cd is either bootable or not, if you're BIOS can boot from the device, the cd will boot
2005-09-20T08:44:00.000Z	zdennis	sportman	it's not like the cd gets an option
2005-09-20T08:44:00.000Z	zdennis	sportman	and decides not to boot
2005-09-20T08:44:00.000Z	zdennis	sportman	download another iso
2005-09-20T08:44:00.000Z	zdennis	sportman	i got that part. i think your disk is messed
2005-09-20T08:45:00.000Z	zdennis	sportman	do you have any other computer nearby to where you could boot the cd?
2005-09-20T08:45:00.000Z	zdennis	sportman	 just to see if it boots
2005-09-20T08:46:00.000Z	zdennis	sportman	so you have access to 1 machine whereve you are? There is no person within a 100 yards that owns a computer that you could ask if you could see if a disk worked?
2005-09-20T08:51:00.000Z	zdennis	sportman	you would kick him from the room because he said life's a bit?
