2007-04-21T05:07:00.000Z	greg_g		I have a partition question for you:  I have 3 partitions on a 20 gig harddrive, a 7 gig /, 10 gig /home, and 1 gig swap.  I want to merge the / and /home partitions to be one single /, is there a way to do that without destroying / ??  I can destroy /home (backup on another harddrive)
2007-04-21T05:07:00.000Z	greg_g		alter... yeah
2007-04-21T05:08:00.000Z	greg_g		alternate worked for me
2007-04-21T05:08:00.000Z	greg_g		got about 5 liveCDs :)
2007-04-21T05:09:00.000Z	greg_g		thanks Flannel and erUSUL btw
2007-04-21T05:11:00.000Z	greg_g		oh, I guess one more question about the partition thing, after I delete /home and expand /, do I just copy /home to the / ??
2007-04-21T05:11:00.000Z	Flannel	greg_g	/home will be gone after you delete it.
2007-04-21T05:08:00.000Z	Flannel	greg_g	Are they setup like that?  / /home swap?
2007-04-21T05:08:00.000Z	greg_g	Flannel	yes
2007-04-21T05:08:00.000Z	Flannel	greg_g	then yeah, you can just delete /home and expand /.  You'll need a liveCD
2007-04-21T05:12:00.000Z	Flannel	greg_g	eh?  Inside of the / partition, you'l need to copy your /home stuff
2007-04-21T05:13:00.000Z	greg_g	Flannel	yeah, so I don't just boot LiveCD, delete /home, expand /, reboot.  Before I reboot, I copy the backup of /home to the now expanded / right?
2007-04-21T05:14:00.000Z	Flannel	greg_g	Wrong order.  You mount both, copy /homes partition contents into /s partition (in the folder /home) then delete /home and expand /.
2007-04-21T05:14:00.000Z	Flannel	greg_g	Once you've deleted /home (the partition), there won't be any data to copy
2007-04-21T05:15:00.000Z	Flannel	greg_g	ah, copy your backup, yeah.  Therell be a folder /home inside of that partition, put the stuff you backed up inside of there.  And you'll need to delete the /home line in your fstab too.
2007-04-21T05:16:00.000Z	greg_g	Flannel	delete /home in fstab ??  lost me there
2007-04-21T05:16:00.000Z	Flannel	greg_g	in a file, /etc/fstab, it tells your computer what to mount where.  You'll need to remove the /home one, since you no longer have a home partition
2007-04-21T05:17:00.000Z	greg_g	Flannel	ahh, makes sense
