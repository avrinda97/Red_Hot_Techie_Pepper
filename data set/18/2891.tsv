2010-03-09T23:19:00.000Z	corpogen		how can I install a rpm packaje with ubuntu?
2010-03-09T23:19:00.000Z	jrib	corpogen	you avoid it.  What do you want to install?
2010-03-09T23:22:00.000Z	jrib	corpogen	you should contact them about the best way to install it on a debian system.  That's the best thing to do.  Otherwise, see what exactly the .sh is trying to do.
2010-03-09T23:23:00.000Z	corpogen	jrib	this is what i get when i try to install it from the .sh file http://paste.ubuntu.com/391893/
2010-03-09T23:25:00.000Z	jrib	corpogen	I said to see what it does :)  Because that's important here.  It could decide to wipe everything on your system which you probably don't want.  Anyway, don't run it through sh, make it executable and execute it instead (it likely has bashisms and hopefully the shebang reflects this)
2010-03-09T23:35:00.000Z	jrib	corpogen	did you do what I said?
2010-03-09T23:38:00.000Z	jrib	corpogen	no, just put my nick in what you say if you want me to notice it
2010-03-09T23:39:00.000Z	corpogen	jrib	like this?
2010-03-09T23:39:00.000Z	jrib	corpogen	exactly
2010-03-09T23:39:00.000Z	corpogen	jrib	ah ok, so wait u say something about turning it into executable, how do i do that, chmod +x?
2010-03-09T23:40:00.000Z	jrib	corpogen	sure
2010-03-09T23:40:00.000Z	corpogen	jrib	yes i tried that and same error
2010-03-09T23:40:00.000Z	jrib	corpogen	read the rest of what I said then :)
2010-03-09T23:43:00.000Z	corpogen	jrib	executing is with ./ right
2010-03-09T23:43:00.000Z	jrib	corpogen	sure
