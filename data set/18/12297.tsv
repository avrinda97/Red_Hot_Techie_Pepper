2006-05-10T13:22:00.000Z	mdke		anyone?
2006-05-10T13:22:00.000Z	mdke		mustard5:
2006-05-10T13:22:00.000Z	mdke		does anyone know how I can change a whole lot of files at the same time? I just wanna strip something out of a lot of filenames
2006-05-10T13:23:00.000Z	hastesaver	mdke	what exactly do you want to? change files or only filenames?
2006-05-10T13:23:00.000Z	mdke	hastesaver	just filenames.
2006-05-10T13:24:00.000Z	hastesaver	mdke	and what kind of changes?
2006-05-10T13:24:00.000Z	mdke	hastesaver	stripping a few letters out of each of them.
2006-05-10T13:25:00.000Z	hastesaver	mdke	ok, then as mustard5 said, something that can do regexes -- sed, awk, perl, ...
2006-05-10T13:26:00.000Z	mdke	hastesaver	I don't know how to use any of those.
2006-05-10T13:26:00.000Z	hastesaver	mdke	could you give a concrete example of the change you want to make?
2006-05-10T13:27:00.000Z	mdke	hastesaver	OK. I have lots of files with different names, all containing the same letters "-nq8", which I want to replace with "".
2006-05-10T13:27:00.000Z	mdke		i.e. nothing
2006-05-10T13:28:00.000Z	hastesaver	mdke	echo "foo-nq8bar" | sed -e s/-nq8// prints foobar
2006-05-10T13:29:00.000Z	mdke	hastesaver	but all the files have different names except for those letters. I need to do the same command on every file.
2006-05-10T13:29:00.000Z	hastesaver	mdke	so you would do something like: for i in *; do echo a=`"$i" | sed -e s/-nq8//`; mv $i $a; done
2006-05-10T13:30:00.000Z	hastesaver	mdke	but be careful, I'm not very sure
2006-05-10T13:30:00.000Z	mdke	hastesaver	alright, thanks.
2006-05-10T13:30:00.000Z	hastesaver	mdke	I think this works: for i in *; do echo a=`"$i" | sed -e s/-nq8//`; mv "$i" "$a"; done
