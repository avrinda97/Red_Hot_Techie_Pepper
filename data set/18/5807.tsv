2008-08-24T23:46:00.000Z	robelliott2125		Does anyone know why an SWF file would play slowly in FF3?  The addon's I have loaded are fine, as they're also on my XP Dual Boot, and the SWF File isn't slow on there.
2008-08-24T23:47:00.000Z	refefer	robelliott2125	have you tried reinstalling it?
2008-08-24T23:47:00.000Z	refefer	robelliott2125	the flash player
2008-08-24T23:48:00.000Z	refefer	robelliott2125	which version of flash are you using?
2008-08-24T23:49:00.000Z	refefer	robelliott2125	you can check by going to firefox 3 -> tools -> addons -> plugins and checking it out
2008-08-24T23:50:00.000Z	robelliott2125	refefer	 sudo apt-get sun-java6-plugin
2008-08-24T23:50:00.000Z	refefer	robelliott2125	you said a swf file right?
2008-08-24T23:50:00.000Z	refefer	robelliott2125	that's adobe flash, not java
2008-08-24T23:50:00.000Z	robelliott2125	refefer	Java - Plug-in 1.6.0_06
2008-08-24T23:52:00.000Z	refefer	robelliott2125	the problem isn't java if it is a SWF file.  It's Adobe Flash that plays it, so we need to find out if that is up-to-date and if so reinstall it
2008-08-24T23:52:00.000Z	refefer	robelliott2125	in the 'plugins' on FF3, check out the shockwave flash plugin
2008-08-24T23:52:00.000Z	robelliott2125	refefer	I have Shockwave Flash installed
2008-08-24T23:53:00.000Z	robelliott2125	refefer	- Shockwave Flash 9.0 r124
2008-08-24T23:53:00.000Z	refefer	robelliott2125	hmm, that's the current version.  Do you have a link to the swf that won't work?
2008-08-24T23:53:00.000Z	robelliott2125	refefer	i have it locally loaded, so I could continue playing the game
2008-08-24T23:54:00.000Z	refefer	robelliott2125	ok, now I understand you a bit better.  I've never had any luck playing locally loaded SWFs that I have acquired through FF3, windows or ubuntu.  Maybe someone else will chime in with better info
2008-08-24T23:55:00.000Z	refefer	robelliott2125	good luck, if it's a video, I'd check VLC Player
2008-08-24T23:55:00.000Z	robelliott2125	refefer	it plays perfectly in windows (the same swf), and the website itself is slow too refefer (in linux)
