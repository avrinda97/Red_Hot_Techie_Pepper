2007-12-24T18:22:00.000Z	chazco		Hi... is there anyway to completly undo any apt-get activity from today?
2007-12-24T18:23:00.000Z	chazco		A lot unfortunatly... tried to install Mythtv...
2007-12-24T18:25:00.000Z	chazco		Ok... think i'm going to have to uninstall Ubuntu (again :( )
2007-12-24T18:25:00.000Z	chazco		Takes ages to reinstall, not looking forward to it
2007-12-24T18:26:00.000Z	chazco		While i'm here, how can I stop my laptop running fsck when on battery?
2007-12-24T18:27:00.000Z	crush_groove	chazco	 why are you reinstalling?
2007-12-24T18:27:00.000Z	chazco		Because installing MythTv has screwed quite a lot of stuff up
2007-12-24T18:27:00.000Z	chazco		Not having much luck with Ubuntu lately :(
2007-12-24T18:27:00.000Z	crush_groove		chazco
2007-12-24T18:28:00.000Z	crush_groove	chazco	 sudo apt-get remove --purge MythTv
2007-12-24T18:28:00.000Z	chazco		It installed quite a lot of other stuff, e.g. mysql...
2007-12-24T18:28:00.000Z	crush_groove	chazco	uninstall everything like I just showed you
2007-12-24T18:29:00.000Z	chazco		Trouble is I dont know exacttly what it installed, so cant get everything
2007-12-24T18:29:00.000Z	crush_groove		 the chazco --purge will get it
2007-12-24T18:30:00.000Z	chazco		Yep, its way too tricky to do that for this... soundray
2007-12-24T18:30:00.000Z	chazco	crush_groove	- it doesnt show mysql when i run it, so its missed at least one
2007-12-24T18:30:00.000Z	chazco		Long winded maybe... theres quite a lot
2007-12-24T18:31:00.000Z	crush_groove	chazco	 its your decision . you wont learnm anything at all by reinstalling everytime you have an issue
