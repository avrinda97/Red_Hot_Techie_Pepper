2010-04-22T10:21:00.000Z	Iszak		How do I (via terminal/synaptic package manager/firefox) upgrade Firefox on Ubuntu 9.10 to Firefox 3.6.x
2010-04-22T10:21:00.000Z	scunizi	Iszak	that's the daily build and there's a PPa for that.. however it will break flash
2010-04-22T10:22:00.000Z	Iszak	scunizi	how is it a daily build? I thought Firefox 3.6.3 has been out for a while - plus, flash is kinda broken atm doesn't register clicks sometimes.
2010-04-22T10:23:00.000Z	scunizi	Iszak	the PPA version (at least the one I used) is considered a daily build.. updates every day.  and by broken flash I don't mean a little I mean totally non functional
2010-04-22T10:24:00.000Z	Iszak	scunizi	ah that sucks :/ what about a stable 3.6.3? is that possible?
2010-04-22T10:24:00.000Z	scunizi	Iszak	not sure.. couple of us here have dropped back to 3.5
2010-04-22T10:29:00.000Z	scunizi	Iszak	cli.. command line.. in the gui it's know as terminal.. sortof
2010-04-22T10:30:00.000Z	Iszak	scunizi	thought so - how do I get out of it if I accidently go into it?
2010-04-22T10:30:00.000Z	scunizi	Iszak	actually a TTY I believe is the official term
2010-04-22T10:30:00.000Z	scunizi	Iszak	ctrl+alt+F7
2010-04-22T10:31:00.000Z	scunizi	Iszak	F1-6 are tty's.. F7 is always gui
2010-04-22T10:32:00.000Z	scunizi	Iszak	if you gui doesn't start you can do everything from cli.. google irssi as an IRC program.. just one example of  a terminal based program..
2010-04-22T10:32:00.000Z	Iszak	scunizi	so ctrl + alt (1-6) all put it into TTY? what is TTY?
2010-04-22T10:34:00.000Z	scunizi	Iszak	what's fun is after you get a little use to linux.. try using the tty for everything you do.. irc, email, browsing the web etc.. it can be done.
2010-04-22T10:34:00.000Z	Iszak	scunizi	I'd rather not :P I'm a GUI lover.
2010-04-22T10:35:00.000Z	scunizi	Iszak	at some point the skills there are good to have.
2010-04-22T10:36:00.000Z	Iszak	scunizi	agreed but I'd prefer to dabble in terminal then full fledged.
2010-04-22T10:36:00.000Z	scunizi	Iszak	same either way.. expicially when you can bounce back and forth
