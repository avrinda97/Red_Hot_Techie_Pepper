2011-07-08T06:55:00.000Z	Stingray88		would anyone be willing to help me mount my USB drive?
2011-07-08T06:56:00.000Z	Stingray88		It's formatted ext4, but it's not showing up under media
2011-07-08T06:57:00.000Z	Stingray88		can anyone assist me with mounting this drive? I can't remember how it's done
2011-07-08T06:58:00.000Z	Stingray88		yes
2011-07-08T06:58:00.000Z	Stingray88		I just formatted it with gparted to be ext4, and now it isn't showing up
2011-07-08T06:59:00.000Z	dr_willis	Stingray88	 make a fstab entry for it
2011-07-08T07:09:00.000Z	dr_willis	Stingray88	 then make a fstab entry, mount it to /media/yourdisk  then. ;)
2011-07-08T07:21:00.000Z	dr_willis	Stingray88	 if you just access it in the fm. it will mount on demand.
2011-07-08T07:22:00.000Z	Stingray88	dr_willis	what is fm? I want it to be automatically mounted at boot. And the last time I set this up I did not touch fstab
2011-07-08T07:22:00.000Z	dr_willis	Stingray88	 you made an entry to fstab somehow.. thats how its done
2011-07-08T07:22:00.000Z	Stingray88	dr_willis	no, because I'm looking at it right now, and my other drive is not precent in that file, but it mounts automatically
2011-07-08T07:23:00.000Z	Stingray88	dr_willis	present*
2011-07-08T07:23:00.000Z	Stingray88	dr_willis	ext4
2011-07-08T07:24:00.000Z	Stingray88	dr_willis	what I did was done in terminal
2011-07-08T07:28:00.000Z	dr_willis	Stingray88	 i would guess you are confused about the other drive.   and gnome is mounting it at login somehow. thats not the same as at bootup.
2011-07-08T07:28:00.000Z	Stingray88	dr_willis	I don't know what gnome is
2011-10-14T07:45:00.000Z	dr_willis	Stingray88	 may be easier to edit the smb.conf and setup the shares
2011-10-14T07:47:00.000Z	Stingray88	dr_willis	what would be really easy is if the damn server-config-samba gui I've been using for months worked like it always did
