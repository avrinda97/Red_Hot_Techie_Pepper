2005-11-28T16:03:00.000Z	usar	Plus-V-ducky	mmm, I still wish gnomebaker had more features : - P
2005-11-28T16:18:00.000Z	Plus-V-ducky	usar	n00k that driver
2005-11-28T16:19:00.000Z	usar	Plus-V-ducky	uninstall and reinstall?
2005-11-28T16:19:00.000Z	usar	Plus-V-ducky	vesa is alternative but I won't have direct rendering and it's slower
2005-11-28T16:20:00.000Z	Plus-V-ducky	usar	no just uninstall the bad driver and  dselect hold it so it won't come back again
2005-11-28T16:21:00.000Z	usar	Plus-V-ducky	it's the right driver for my hardware, I didn't mean it was the wrong driver
2005-11-28T16:21:00.000Z	usar	Plus-V-ducky	I just upgraded the same package and there was brakage
2005-11-28T16:21:00.000Z	usar	Plus-V-ducky	brakage is French for breakage, of course
2005-11-28T16:21:00.000Z	Plus-V-ducky	usar	then wouldn't you say the upgrade was the proble?
2005-11-28T16:23:00.000Z	usar	Plus-V-ducky	right, and I pin it down on the drivers that were upgraded; I still don't see where you're going solution-wise
2005-11-28T16:23:00.000Z	Plus-V-ducky	usar	revert your drivers
2005-11-28T16:24:00.000Z	usar	Plus-V-ducky	ah, how do I downgrade a package? why would mirror have the older package?
2005-11-28T16:24:00.000Z	Plus-V-ducky	usar	it won't be older -- just possibly misconfigured
2005-11-28T16:25:00.000Z	Plus-V-ducky	usar	man apt-get (or use dselect or aptitude to force a version number)
2005-11-28T16:28:00.000Z	Plus-V-ducky	usar	if you really wants "teh |3LEE|)1|\|6 3d6e", get src from CVS (if avail -- with nvidia, it mioght not be), update your compiler tools and build it yourself
2005-11-28T16:28:00.000Z	usar	Plus-V-ducky	ah, the problem may have been that the update contained both kernel updates and gfx driver updates
2005-11-28T16:29:00.000Z	Plus-V-ducky	usar	I doubt it
