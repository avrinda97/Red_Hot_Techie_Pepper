2008-12-19T06:46:00.000Z	mk123		i just used ndiswrapper to load the .inf file for AR2007 wireless card, then i did 'modprobe ndiswrapper' -- now how can i test that everything is working ?
2008-12-19T06:46:00.000Z	raylu	mk123	lsmod and iwconfig will help you
2008-12-19T06:47:00.000Z	mk123	raylu	i did ifconfig ath0 up , and the i did 'iwlist ath0 scan' , but the scan returned no results -- am i doing things wrong ?
2008-12-19T06:48:00.000Z	raylu	mk123	iwlist shows something meaningful for ath0?
2008-12-19T06:48:00.000Z	mk123	raylu	ndiswrapper is shown in lsmod , and ath0 is up in ifconfig, but when i scan i get no results -- when in installed the madwifi drivers I had the same problem that scan just would no work
2008-12-19T06:48:00.000Z	mk123	raylu	whats the exact command you want me to run?
2008-12-19T06:48:00.000Z	raylu	mk123	iwconfig

2008-12-19T06:49:00.000Z	mk123	raylu	is that considered 'meaningful'
2008-12-19T06:50:00.000Z	raylu	mk123	then my only guess is that the card itself is not on
2008-12-19T06:52:00.000Z	mk123	raylu	how can i check if the card is on?
2008-12-19T06:53:00.000Z	raylu	mk123	this is laptop, right? is there a switch or key combination to enble i?
2008-12-19T06:53:00.000Z	raylu	mk123	*enable it?
