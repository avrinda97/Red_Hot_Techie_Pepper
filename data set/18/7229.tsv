2008-01-23T03:43:00.000Z	andrewmin		anyone know where the apt cache is stored and how to clear it?
2008-01-23T03:43:00.000Z	andrewmin		i createda  faulty package
2008-01-23T03:43:00.000Z	andrewmin		and i need to remove it
2008-01-23T03:43:00.000Z	andrewmin		but it wont remove because the post remove scripts is faulty
2008-01-23T03:44:00.000Z	danand	andrewmin	apt-get clean to clear - /var/apt/cache i believe
2008-01-23T03:45:00.000Z	danand	andrewmin	/var/cache/apt/archives/
2008-01-23T03:45:00.000Z	andrewmin	danand	i checked there, but my package aint there
2008-01-23T03:47:00.000Z	danand	andrewmin	Is this a locally created package ie one you have made yourself?
2008-01-23T03:48:00.000Z	andrewmin	danand	i messed up the post-install scripts. but now i cant remove it :-P
2008-01-23T03:48:00.000Z	danand	andrewmin	Have you tried using aptitude - it has section for obsolete and locally created packages
2008-01-23T03:49:00.000Z	andrewmin	danand	ill try that
2008-01-23T04:01:00.000Z	danand	andrewmin	Any luck with aptitude??
2008-01-23T04:05:00.000Z	danand	andrewmin	Just had a thought - if apt aptitude is not working for you, you may want to try using dpkg directly to remove the package. apt and derivatives (aptitude, synaptics, apt-get etc) are all front ends for dpkg
2008-01-23T04:26:00.000Z	danand	andrewmin	Take it aptitude didn't work - could look at using dpkg directly but think that will give you similar errors
2008-01-23T04:26:00.000Z	andrewmin	danand	dpkg also failed
2008-01-23T04:28:00.000Z	danand	andrewmin	Fix your postrm script - rebuild package - install updated version??
2008-01-23T04:28:00.000Z	danand	andrewmin	Then remove!! :)
2008-01-23T04:40:00.000Z	danand	andrewmin	Just thought - dpkg -L | --listfiles package ...  List files installed to your system from package. Manual remove perhaps then update dpkg's list of installed packages
