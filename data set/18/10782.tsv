2006-11-21T09:15:00.000Z	dauoalagio		Ubunty live CD doesn;t start on my notebook, any ideas?
2006-11-21T09:16:00.000Z	tonyyserver	dauoalagio	Doesn't start at all, or can't start X?
2006-11-21T09:16:00.000Z	dauoalagio	tonyyserver	doesn't start at all, goes straight to winfows
2006-11-21T09:16:00.000Z	tonyyserver	dauoalagio	You likely need to change the boot priority in your BIOS
2006-11-21T09:17:00.000Z	dauoalagio	tonyyserver	i already tried that
2006-11-21T09:17:00.000Z	tonyyserver	dauoalagio	Okay.  Are you sure you burned the CD "From an image", rather than just burning the iso as a file onto a CD?
2006-11-21T09:18:00.000Z	dauoalagio	tonyyserver	yes, i even ordered some cds, and tried those,  neither edgy or dapper work
2006-11-21T09:18:00.000Z	tonyyserver	dauoalagio	Can your system boot from other CDs?
2006-11-21T09:19:00.000Z	dauoalagio	tonyyserver	yes the gentoo cd worked.
2006-11-21T09:19:00.000Z	dauoalagio		wiseguy: no error, just straight to windows
2006-11-21T09:20:00.000Z	dauoalagio		wiseguy: yep
2006-11-21T09:20:00.000Z	tonyyserver	dauoalagio	Have you tried the one-time device selection in addition to general bios boot priority?
2006-11-21T09:20:00.000Z	dauoalagio	tonyyserver	don't think so
2006-11-21T09:21:00.000Z	tonyyserver	dauoalagio	That's the only other thing I can think of
2006-11-21T09:21:00.000Z	dauoalagio	tonyyserver	how to?
2006-11-21T09:22:00.000Z	dauoalagio		wiseguy: there is nothing like that. i've gotten ubuntu to work on here before.  and now i want it back, but it wont' start
2006-11-21T09:22:00.000Z	tonyyserver	dauoalagio	Well, on my system I think it's F11, but that varies.  Basically it's the same method as getting into the bios setup - hit random F keys until you see the menu.
2006-11-21T09:22:00.000Z	dauoalagio	tonyyserver	yeah..
