2006-01-20T08:27:00.000Z	Sanne	deefzi	did you go to the grub manual? There's something about windows on a non-first hard disk.
2006-01-20T08:30:00.000Z	Sanne	deefzi	please... could you listen to me for a sec? I believe I might have help for you.
2006-01-20T08:30:00.000Z	deefzi	Sanne	you pasted the url before?
2006-01-20T08:31:00.000Z	deefzi	Sanne	i chechked it through (although very quickly since all the chatting here) and it seemed i could get some help there.
2006-01-20T08:31:00.000Z	Sanne	deefzi	yes, I think it's just what you need, called disk swapping.
2006-01-20T08:32:00.000Z	Sanne	deefzi	you basically tell windows that it is on the first hd, when in fact it is not.
2006-01-20T08:32:00.000Z	deefzi	Sanne	how's that possible?
2006-01-20T08:33:00.000Z	Sanne	deefzi	in the grub config file, you put something like: grub> map (hd0) (hd1) and grub> map (hd1) (hd0) and kinda lie to windows ;). It's detailed in the grub manual.
2006-01-20T08:34:00.000Z	deefzi	Sanne	YES YES YES! that's the help i was looking for.
2006-01-20T08:34:00.000Z	Sanne	deefzi	;)
2006-01-20T08:34:00.000Z	deefzi	Sanne	url to manual, pls? :)

2006-01-20T08:38:00.000Z	deefzi	Sanne	i should probably make bunch of backups before doing anything this radical :-)
2006-01-20T08:39:00.000Z	Sanne	deefzi	I don't know dangerous this procedure is, I just happened to remember this chapter and thought this might be what you need. But backups are always a good idea ;).
2006-01-20T08:40:00.000Z	deefzi	Sanne	yes. that wont touch the data, but if i somehow dama... well the odds are 1%
2006-01-20T08:40:00.000Z	deefzi	Sanne	friend of mine fucked up his harddrive though. he had to make script that scanned HD one bit at a time to check where was the starting point of his windows partition
2006-01-20T08:41:00.000Z	Sanne	deefzi	I understand regardless, I'm very paranoid myself. I backed up everything when I installed Ubuntu in October, but of course everything went well ;)
