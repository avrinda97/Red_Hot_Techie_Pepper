2010-09-11T15:35:00.000Z	ranthi		there we go..got the conf file
2010-09-11T15:35:00.000Z	ranthi		thanks
2010-09-11T15:35:00.000Z	ranthi		also, incase i want to do some remote admin..and because im lazy and dont want to look it up
2010-09-11T15:36:00.000Z	ranthi		what is the ssh flag to run X through it so you can remote run X programs?
2010-09-11T15:38:00.000Z	ranthi		gleb, its not really that there are no more conf files...there are always conf files if you want them..for instance
2010-09-11T15:39:00.000Z	ranthi		if you are insane like I am and decide one day you want to slim down the kernel to only have the drivers available for your hardware
2010-09-11T15:40:00.000Z	ranthi		you might want to have that conf file..
2010-09-11T15:40:00.000Z	ariqz	ranthi	does that save a lot of memory?
2010-09-11T15:41:00.000Z	ranthi	ariqz	have you ever played with gentoo?  man..you can slim down that kernel to leave almost no footprint so yeah..its eventually not a bad idea
2010-09-11T15:41:00.000Z	ariqz	ranthi	no, I haven't played with gentoo
2010-09-11T15:41:00.000Z	ranthi		but only for an either very experienced or very crazy person
2010-09-11T15:42:00.000Z	ariqz	ranthi	you could always download the kernel source for ubuntu and compile that though :)
2010-09-11T15:42:00.000Z	ranthi		gleb, thats true..but personally..i found it a lot of fun.  you learn an awful lot during the process
2010-09-11T15:43:00.000Z	ranthi		gleb, you can also mess alot of things up too..:/
2010-09-11T15:43:00.000Z	ariqz		I compiled my ubuntu kernel because I needed to patch it to get packet injection working ;)
2010-09-11T15:44:00.000Z	ranthi		gleb, it has been a long long time since i went through that bootstrap to window manager process though..i have forgotten so much..trying to get back into it
2010-09-11T15:44:00.000Z	ariqz		really, I find that easier than dealing with all my other ubuntu issues, like getting restricted drivers to work properly
2010-09-11T15:46:00.000Z	ranthi	ariqz	you know what though..I find doing that to be awesome..you learn where things are how they work, what you can/cant change..far better than a fire and forget way of doing it
