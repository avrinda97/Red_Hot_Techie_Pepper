2009-03-09T11:17:00.000Z	Lartza_	Dexi	Maybe you have GTK :)
2009-03-09T11:19:00.000Z	Lartza_	Dexi	What theme is it?
2009-03-09T11:19:00.000Z	Dexi	Lartza_	i see GTK-chtheme and gtk-qt-engine
2009-03-09T11:19:00.000Z	Lartza_	Dexi	WHere did you get it?

2009-03-09T11:20:00.000Z	Lartza_	Dexi	Yea install gtk-engines and gtk2-engines
2009-03-09T11:21:00.000Z	Lartza_	Dexi	Did you install the theme correctly?
2009-03-09T11:21:00.000Z	Dexi	Lartza_	it said i did
2009-03-09T11:22:00.000Z	Lartza_	Dexi	Hmm...
2009-03-09T11:24:00.000Z	Lartza_	Dexi	Are you using 8.10?
2009-03-09T11:26:00.000Z	Lartza_	Dexi	I doubt but it could need gtk-qt-engine or gtk2-sharp2
2009-03-09T11:29:00.000Z	Dexi	Lartza_	it wasnt gtk-qt but im checking sharp2 right now
2009-03-09T11:31:00.000Z	Dexi	Lartza_	neither of those :P lol i may just be doomed here...
2009-03-09T11:33:00.000Z	Lartza_	Dexi	But your problem is easy, you should hear what I did yesterday... WIndows install, twice, Fedora install, kernelmod ati drivers then wait until evening to get help to recreate initrd and still not working :)
2009-03-09T11:34:00.000Z	Lartza_	Dexi	Lol? Ubuntu is easy to install :)
