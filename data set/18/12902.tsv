2006-02-26T14:13:00.000Z	Mordof		im in Dapper Drake, how do i get out of X???
2006-02-26T14:13:00.000Z	Arafangi1n	Mordof	Ctrl+Alt+F1 through to F12, F7 is generally what X runs on.
2006-02-26T14:13:00.000Z	Mordof	Arafangi1n	k
2006-02-26T14:16:00.000Z	Arafangi1n	Mordof	Do what I said, then login in the console, then issue gdm stop.
2006-02-26T14:16:00.000Z	Mordof	Arafangi1n	oh ok
2006-02-26T14:16:00.000Z	Arafangi1n	Mordof	I don't know what you've been doing, but that _WILL_ stop it.
2006-02-26T14:18:00.000Z	Mordof	Arafangi1n	that doesnt stop it at all
2006-02-26T14:18:00.000Z	Mordof	Arafangi1n	i need to get out of it
2006-02-26T14:18:00.000Z	Mordof	Arafangi1n	i cant even stop it from inside the console while logged in, stopping gdm doesn't work at all for me
2006-02-26T14:18:00.000Z	Arafangi1n	Mordof	What did you end up when you hit Ctrl+Alt+F1 ?
2006-02-26T14:19:00.000Z	Mordof	Arafangi1n	in cli, but then when i went to f7 again it was still loaded
2006-02-26T14:19:00.000Z	Mordof	Arafangi1n	im trying to load xgl.. and i need all X and gnome to not be running
2006-02-26T14:19:00.000Z	Arafangi1n	Mordof	Ok, hit Ctrl+Alt+Backspace after you do the configuration for xgl
2006-02-26T14:20:00.000Z	Mordof	Arafangi1n	ive got it all ready to go in a script to run, i just cant seem to get rid of X or gnome
2006-02-26T14:20:00.000Z	Arafangi1n	Mordof	Something is very wierd on yours.
2006-02-26T14:21:00.000Z	Mordof	Arafangi1n	i know, i need another method to get out of it
2006-02-26T14:21:00.000Z	Arafangi1n	Mordof	Well, let's get to basics. Do you even use GDM?
2006-02-26T14:21:00.000Z	Mordof	Arafangi1n	if dapper uses it by default, then yes
