2012-03-12T23:26:00.000Z	_Marcus		Hello. How do I use cat to write to a drive?
2012-03-12T23:26:00.000Z	_Marcus		I want to write /dev/urandom to it
2012-03-12T23:27:00.000Z	codatory	_Marcus	Any reason not to use DD ?
2012-03-12T23:28:00.000Z	codatory	_Marcus	yep; that's what it's for...  dd -if=/dev/urandom -of=/dev/hdx
2012-03-12T23:29:00.000Z	_Marcus	codatory	It says: dd: opening `/media/4CA6-7063': Is a directory
2012-03-12T23:30:00.000Z	codatory	_Marcus	That's the mountpoint, not the device, if you just want to write a big file to the mountpoint you can cat /dev/urandom > somefile and it'll just go until you stop it or it runs out of disk
2012-03-12T23:31:00.000Z	_Marcus	codatory	Oh, okay.
2012-03-12T23:33:00.000Z	codatory	_Marcus	Yeah; just make sure that's what you want. That's a destructive operation.
2012-03-12T23:33:00.000Z	_Marcus	codatory	So I should just use cat?
2012-03-12T23:33:00.000Z	codatory	_Marcus	Depends on what you're trying to accomplish
2012-03-12T23:33:00.000Z	_Marcus	codatory	I am just writing to the disk a bunch of times.
2012-03-12T23:34:00.000Z	_Marcus	codatory	To clear all data, and make it non-recoverable.
2012-03-12T23:34:00.000Z	codatory	_Marcus	Then dd/shred is what you want. But you'll have to repartition afterwards.
2012-03-12T23:34:00.000Z	_Marcus	codatory	Okay. So what shuold I do for dd?
2012-03-12T23:35:00.000Z	codatory	_Marcus	dd -if=/dev/urandom -of=/dev/sdb
2012-03-12T23:36:00.000Z	_Marcus	codatory	Disk Utility said my drive was /dev/sdb1, should I do that instead?
2012-03-12T23:36:00.000Z	codatory	_Marcus	That's the partition, the drive is the partition less the partition #
2012-03-12T23:37:00.000Z	_Marcus	codatory	But Disk Utility said "Device: /dev/sda1"
