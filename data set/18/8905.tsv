2008-04-12T23:06:00.000Z	dtolj	Pirate_Hunter	create a hidden file in ~/.xinitrc and call the script from there, should start when X starts.
2008-04-12T23:08:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	dtolj	that folder dont exist in my system (of course that doesnt mean i couldnt create it) im just going to run the script from template since i never used that folder
2008-04-12T23:09:00.000Z	dtolj	Pirate_Hunter	.xinitrc is a file sorry
2008-04-12T23:12:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	dtolj	you mean type the path to the script and run .xinitrc from session, is that what you mean
2008-04-12T23:13:00.000Z	dtolj	Pirate_Hunter	No, you dont have to run it. Its called when you start X, just create the file in your $HOME and add your script in there.
2008-04-12T23:14:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	dtolj	ok but do i type the full path of the script inside .xinittrc?
2008-04-12T23:15:00.000Z	dtolj	Pirate_Hunter	yes of course
2008-04-12T23:16:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	dtolj	np will so, but that file dont exist in my ~/. which is weird or it must be a hardy thing :/
2008-04-12T23:16:00.000Z	dtolj	Pirate_Hunter	it usually dosn't you have to create it to add this feature for X window./
2008-04-12T23:17:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	dtolj	ok now how do i go about doing this?
2008-04-12T23:18:00.000Z	dtolj	Pirate_Hunter	nano ~/.xinitrc
2008-04-12T23:19:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	dtolj	& next time i login it will pick up whatever it is in it also i dont have to be in sudo
2008-04-12T23:20:00.000Z	dtolj	Pirate_Hunter	correct: http://www.slackbook.org/html/x-window-system-xinitrc.html
2008-04-12T23:21:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	dtolj	will read that
2008-04-12T23:50:00.000Z	dtolj	Pirate_Hunter	did it work?
2008-04-12T23:51:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	dtolj	dont know im currently doing it since i had to do something, the link you gave me states for me to copy details from the default xinit and copy them to xinitrc which is what im trying to find out
2008-04-12T23:52:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	dtolj	I dont have a problem using that version on the link but i might stop things assigned automatically from starting
2008-04-13T00:00:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	dtolj	found it good thing i didnt use that example .xinitr and yeah thanx for the locate command it came in handy
