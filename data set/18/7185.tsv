2011-06-06T08:22:00.000Z	rww	Corey	Ubuntu doesn't include aptitude by default any more, we usually use (the inferior) apt-get instructions instead :(
2011-06-06T08:24:00.000Z	Corey	rww	That's... horrifiying. :-)
2011-06-06T08:25:00.000Z	rww	Corey	as an aptitude user, I facepalmed a lot, yes.
2011-06-06T08:25:00.000Z	Corey	rww	And what drove the "dropping aptitude" call?
2011-06-06T08:25:00.000Z	rww	Corey	space on the LiveCD
2011-06-21T07:25:00.000Z	rww	Corey	If there's no MX record, A is used instead.
2011-06-21T07:26:00.000Z	Corey	rww	Correct, but it's poor practice.
2011-06-21T07:26:00.000Z	rww	Corey	Why?
2011-06-21T07:26:00.000Z	Corey	rww	As well as, in this case [THC]AcidRain has an MX record that points to GoDaddy.
2011-06-21T07:26:00.000Z	rww	Corey	ah
2011-06-21T07:28:00.000Z	Corey	rww	And there are some busted mailservers out there that don't honor A records; they choke on a lack of MX.
2011-06-21T07:28:00.000Z	Corey	rww	Not common, but email is a study in edge and corner cases.
2011-09-20T04:08:00.000Z	rww	Corey	it's past midnight in freenode time, talk normal :(
2011-09-20T04:08:00.000Z	Corey	rww	I be on the west cast, ye seadog!
2011-09-20T04:09:00.000Z	rww	Corey	no excuse to not have your IRC client in UTC :(
2011-09-20T04:09:00.000Z	Corey	rww	You think this be communist China? :-)
2011-09-20T04:09:00.000Z	rww	Corey	UTC is best timezone :(
