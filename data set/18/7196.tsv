2008-05-29T23:00:00.000Z	lolzer	Jakoo	be careful with the cut and paste operations detailed there and it should fix it.
2008-05-29T23:01:00.000Z	Jakoo		ok ty
2008-05-29T23:03:00.000Z	Jakoo	lolzer	Reboot, Halt, Suspend and Custom Command that' it?
2008-05-29T23:06:00.000Z	lolzer	Jakoo	just cut out the text *including* the quotation marks, save, then paste it back in and save for both commands. make sure you paste it back in and save. then reboot. it should fix it.
2008-05-29T23:06:00.000Z	Jakoo		thank you lolzer
2008-05-29T23:07:00.000Z	lolzer	Jakoo	here is more discussion on the bug: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=784295&highlight=network+manager+shutdown+error
2008-05-29T23:08:00.000Z	lolzer	Jakoo	I had the same issue and this fixed it. the important thing to note is that it is not a serious problem. just a bug. your system is still shutting down properly.
