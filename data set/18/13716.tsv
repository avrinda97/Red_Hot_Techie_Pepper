2008-04-19T10:26:00.000Z	misfit_246		can someone help me?  My ubuntu is going haywire since I installed automatix.  Permissions are messed up and some of my own files are not deletable or writable to me.  I need to back up some stuff to an external drive but it says I don't have write permissions.  It's an ntfs drive, can someone please help?
