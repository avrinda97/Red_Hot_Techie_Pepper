2006-08-05T05:10:00.000Z	SonicChao	MistaED	Yes.
2006-08-05T05:11:00.000Z	MistaED	SonicChao	which driver??? :O! i attempted it awhile ago for someone and failed
2006-08-05T05:11:00.000Z	SonicChao	MistaED	Driver? wtf?
2006-08-05T05:12:00.000Z	SonicChao	MistaED	What system were you using?
2006-08-05T05:12:00.000Z	SonicChao	MistaED	The new DW6000?
2006-08-05T05:12:00.000Z	MistaED	SonicChao	oh, i take it you have the ethernet-based one? i was trying to get a usb one to work
2006-08-05T05:12:00.000Z	SonicChao	MistaED	Yes, ethernet based is what I have.
2006-08-05T05:12:00.000Z	MistaED		with an ISDN connection for the uplink (that worked fine on its own)
2006-08-05T05:13:00.000Z	SonicChao	MistaED	The USB system is old =)
2006-08-05T05:13:00.000Z	SonicChao	MistaED	the new systems (DW6000 and DW7000) use ethernet. =)
2006-08-05T05:13:00.000Z	MistaED	SonicChao	telstra in australia still stock it though, :(
2006-08-05T05:14:00.000Z	SonicChao	MistaED	=(
2006-08-05T05:14:00.000Z	SonicChao	MistaED	I wouldn't know, I'm in the USA.
2006-08-05T05:15:00.000Z	SonicChao	MistaED	Well, that's all I can tell you. USB used to only work for PC and Mac.
2006-08-05T05:16:00.000Z	SonicChao	MistaED	But with a little tweaking, the ethernet based systems work perfectly. =)
2006-08-05T05:16:00.000Z	MistaED	SonicChao	no worries thanks anyway, i almost got a free driver off sourceforge to go, i could get signal readings and stuff to work
2006-08-05T05:17:00.000Z	SonicChao	MistaED	Oh, alright.
