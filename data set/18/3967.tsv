2009-07-12T17:51:00.000Z	MindVirus		Anyone know?
2009-07-12T17:53:00.000Z	gabkdlly	MindVirus	not sure, but it may have to do with the 5% (or so) reserved for root on the filesystem
2009-07-12T17:53:00.000Z	gabkdlly	MindVirus	available is probably what you are interested in
2009-07-12T17:53:00.000Z	MindVirus	gabkdlly	that's a brilliant point.
2009-07-12T17:53:00.000Z	MindVirus	gabkdlly	thanks.
2009-07-12T17:54:00.000Z	gabkdlly	MindVirus	you can actually configure this at the time of partition
2009-07-12T17:54:00.000Z	MindVirus	gabkdlly	I don't really mind -- I was just curious. They seemed like the same damn thing.
2009-07-12T17:54:00.000Z	MindVirus	gabkdlly	now, I can't configure it?
2009-07-12T17:55:00.000Z	gabkdlly	MindVirus	I don't think so. Anyway, I think there are good reasons to have the 5% reserved
2009-07-12T17:56:00.000Z	MindVirus	gabkdlly	of course.
2009-07-12T17:56:00.000Z	MindVirus	gabkdlly	the deal is, I have a drive that is not for root at all.
2009-07-12T17:58:00.000Z	MindVirus		For some reason, pulseaudio is not starting with my session. Should I add it to Startup Applications?
2009-07-12T18:03:00.000Z	MindVirus		Any suggestions, anyone?

2009-07-12T18:09:00.000Z	gabkdlly	MindVirus	if, for example, you have a 1TB drive dedicated to /home/, or so, you can probably allocate less than 5% to root
2009-07-12T18:09:00.000Z	MindVirus	gabkdlly	I have an 80GB drive dedicated to being my ~/Downloads folder.
2009-07-12T18:10:00.000Z	gabkdlly	MindVirus	keep in mind, though, that if you go with 0%, and your drive fills up, there will be a lot fragmentation, which will affect read/write times
2009-07-12T18:10:00.000Z	MindVirus	gabkdlly	good point, again.
