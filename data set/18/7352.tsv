2012-11-03T13:31:00.000Z	prgmmer		Hi. Can anyone help me with the libc6 unmet dependencies issues? apt-get -f install does does not seem to work
2012-11-03T13:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	prgmmer	can you give the output of: sudo apt-get -f install
2012-11-03T13:33:00.000Z	prgmmer	ActionParsnip	sure give me a second, running it again
2012-11-03T13:38:00.000Z	prgmmer	ActionParsnip	The output is pretty long. Here's the last portion of the output. http://paste.ubuntu.com/1328699/
2012-11-03T13:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	prgmmer	oh jeez, what a mess. Partial upgrades are always hell
2012-11-03T13:41:00.000Z	prgmmer	ActionParsnip	Any idea what the procedure should be to fix the libc6-dev dependency issue? http://paste.ubuntu.com/1328699/. Thanks
2012-11-03T13:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	prgmmer	what is the output of:  lsb_release -sc
2012-11-03T13:44:00.000Z	prgmmer	ActionParsnip	It says "quantal". But when I login initially it always shows 12.04. I believe I am in some weird partial-upgrade hell. System is usable, I just can't install or remove anything via apt-get.
2012-11-03T13:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	prgmmer	quantal is 12.10
2012-11-03T13:45:00.000Z	prgmmer	ActionParsnip	I know, but when I login it says 12.04. My repos have been all updated to quantal.
2012-11-03T13:49:00.000Z	prgmmer	ActionParsnip	So my repositories say quantal, but I'm still stuck with this weird libc6-dev i386 and amd64 dependency issue. Any ideas how to fix the packages so apt-get will work again? Is there some kind of manual method?
2012-11-03T13:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	prgmmer	can you pastebin the output of the command I gave please
2012-11-03T13:51:00.000Z	prgmmer	ActionParsnip	of lsb_release -sc? http://paste.ubuntu.com/1328728/
2012-11-03T13:53:00.000Z	prgmmer	ActionParsnip	yup, I've been surviving for about a month on just compiling stuff out of git, but some of the packages I need have about 20 dependencies and I feel like I'm only avoiding the problem and that it's gonna bite me in the ass.
2012-11-03T13:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	prgmmer	I'd just clean install Quantal if it was me. If you intend to get to Quantal anyway. Makes life easier
2012-11-03T13:56:00.000Z	prgmmer	ActionParsnip	Is there a good way of transferring over settings or possibly doing a "clean-install" without having to format? I already have a "dead" Ubuntu 6.x-8.04 partition that has data. This will make for another dead partition.
2012-11-03T13:59:00.000Z	prgmmer	ActionParsnip	It's just a lot of data. Would moving my home directory to a separate partition make it easier to deal with clean-installing of the operating system?
2012-11-03T14:07:00.000Z	prgmmer	ActionParsnip	Thanks!
