2007-08-30T07:38:00.000Z	azzurrinux		hello
2007-08-30T07:39:00.000Z	azzurrinux		excuse me, I need to migrate more than 10GB of data
2007-08-30T07:39:00.000Z	azzurrinux		by DVD
2007-08-30T07:39:00.000Z	azzurrinux		in order to avoid corruption
2007-08-30T07:39:00.000Z	azzurrinux		thanks shiester_miester
2007-08-30T07:39:00.000Z	azzurrinux		:)
2007-08-30T07:39:00.000Z	azzurrinux		can I create two tar.gz with MD5 generation and make sure that when extracting on the other server, the MD5 matches?
2007-08-30T07:40:00.000Z	shiester_miester	azzurrinux	it would be easy enough to just use a checksum program and run it on both systems after copying, to check that the checksums of the files match
2007-08-30T07:41:00.000Z	azzurrinux		thanks shiester_miester
2007-08-30T07:41:00.000Z	azzurrinux		as there are kilometers of distance
2007-08-30T07:41:00.000Z	shiester_miester	azzurrinux	I recommend fsum, its a great little checksum program
2007-08-30T07:41:00.000Z	azzurrinux		between the two servers
2007-08-30T07:41:00.000Z	azzurrinux		we will use DVD's
2007-08-30T07:42:00.000Z	azzurrinux		and I think that tar archiving would be better instead of simply creating a ISO image with the content
2007-08-30T07:42:00.000Z	azzurrinux		what do you think, sysadministical taking? :D
2007-08-30T07:44:00.000Z	azzurrinux	shiester_miester	thanks in advance for your help ;)
2007-08-30T07:45:00.000Z	shiester_miester		np
2007-08-30T07:45:00.000Z	azzurrinux	shiester_miester	there will be some thousand files on each DVD
