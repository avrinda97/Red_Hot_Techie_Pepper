2011-04-05T21:58:00.000Z	hedkandi		hi folks, I'd like to posit that mplayer on 10.04 is BROKEN
2011-04-05T21:58:00.000Z	brightspark	hedkandi	really?  I've used mencoder without problems.
2011-04-05T21:59:00.000Z	hedkandi	brightspark	for dvds?
2011-04-05T21:59:00.000Z	hedkandi		the guys on #mplayer tell me the rc3 version is too old to be used
2011-04-05T22:00:00.000Z	brightspark	hedkandi	nope, I was stitching together jpegs to make a movie.  Never tried a dvd in mencoder, I always used totem or vlc

2011-04-05T22:01:00.000Z	hedkandi	brightspark	ya, well my mplayer is ok with tv decoding, so clearly it's partially operating
2011-04-05T22:02:00.000Z	hedkandi		WHILST I'm here, could I just ask if anyone has noticed the annoying "new feature" on picture viewer
2011-04-05T22:03:00.000Z	hedkandi		It prompts you to save pictures when you haven't changed them
2011-04-05T22:03:00.000Z	hedkandi		and has a loony button for edit as well
2011-04-05T22:03:00.000Z	brightspark	hedkandi	could be.  File a bug on launchpad if you really think you found one.
2011-04-05T22:03:00.000Z	hedkandi		good example of programmers with too much time on their hands
2011-04-05T22:04:00.000Z	hedkandi		If it's not broken, don't fix it would be well remembered
2011-04-05T22:04:00.000Z	hedkandi		and instead try to fix all the billions of things that are broken
2011-04-05T22:04:00.000Z	hedkandi		like mplayer for example
2011-04-05T22:04:00.000Z	hedkandi		in lucid
2011-04-05T22:05:00.000Z	brightspark	hedkandi	 Try debian.  Ubuntu is a little more to the feature-rich side of the spectrum, while debian tends to the more stable.  No point using the wrong tool for the job.
2011-04-05T22:06:00.000Z	hedkandi	brightspark	ya well I get the impression ubuntu is a loony scheme to compete with microso
