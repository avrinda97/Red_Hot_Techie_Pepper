2006-07-05T11:02:00.000Z	oskude	pjay_	there is no such package in dapperhttp://packages.ubuntu.com/cgi-bin/search_packages.pl?keywords=x-window-system-dev&searchon=names&subword=1&version=all&release=all
2006-07-05T11:03:00.000Z	pjay_	oskude	what does that mean?
2006-07-05T11:03:00.000Z	oskude	pjay_	try this xserver-xorg-dev
2006-07-05T11:50:00.000Z	oskude	pjay_	that will remove wine that you installed through apt-get
2006-07-05T11:52:00.000Z	oskude	pjay_	did you install outside apt-get  ?
2006-07-05T11:52:00.000Z	oskude	pjay_	and what did you do ?
2006-07-05T11:53:00.000Z	oskude	pjay_	well, if you know how to compile things, you _should_ allso know how to uninstall them...
2006-07-05T11:53:00.000Z	oskude	pjay_	with out looking if it has info on how to uninstall ?
2006-07-05T11:54:00.000Z	oskude	pjay_	in best case its "sudo make uninstall" (if you did sudo make install)
2006-07-05T11:55:00.000Z	oskude	pjay_	there, where you did "sudo make install"
2006-07-05T11:55:00.000Z	oskude	pjay_	lol, well...
