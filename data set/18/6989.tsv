2008-12-19T12:55:00.000Z	rathel_		Anyone use Conky? I'm trying to add audacious to it but I can't figure it out, it's just like "${audacious_status}" right? and the same way for the title and time? It's not working for me.
2008-12-19T12:56:00.000Z	jim_p	rathel_	give me a sec to look it up
2008-12-19T12:57:00.000Z	rathel_	jim_p	Okay.
2008-12-19T13:00:00.000Z	jim_p	rathel_	in conky manual page it says that audacious_title is followed by a number that shows the max characters it can contain
2008-12-19T13:00:00.000Z	jim_p	rathel_	but it does not work for me
2008-12-19T13:01:00.000Z	rathel_	jim_p	Yeah, but the syntax is just ${audacious_status} right? Because it's not working for me.
2008-12-19T13:02:00.000Z	jim_p	rathel_	i put ${audacious_title 60} and no results. i guess it may need to be compiled with the audacious option enabled
2008-12-19T13:02:00.000Z	rathel_	jim_p	Yeah I'm kind of thinking that also.
2008-12-19T13:02:00.000Z	jim_p	rathel_	let me look for compiling options
2008-12-19T13:03:00.000Z	rathel_	jim_p	How do you find the compiled options anyways for packages you download through apt?
2008-12-19T13:04:00.000Z	jim_p	rathel_	from gentoo's wiki or in the apps url i guess
2008-12-19T13:05:00.000Z	jim_p	rathel_	let me look about the compiles options in the repo
2008-12-19T13:09:00.000Z	jim_p	rathel_	bad news               ./configure --prefix=/usr --enable-xft --enable-mpd --enable-double-buffer  --enable-proc-uptime --enable-seti --enable-wlan --enable-rss --enable-smapi
2008-12-19T13:09:00.000Z	rathel_	jim_p	That's why!
2008-12-19T13:09:00.000Z	jim_p	rathel_	it is compiled to use mpd that NO ONE is using, but not audacious!
2008-12-19T13:10:00.000Z	jim_p	rathel_	you can use apt-source to get the source and make a .deb, change the options and compile
2008-12-19T13:12:00.000Z	rathel_	jim_p	Yeah I'm going to. :)
2008-12-19T13:14:00.000Z	jim_p	rathel_	in case you look for the audacious option its        --enable-audacious=yes|no|legacy
