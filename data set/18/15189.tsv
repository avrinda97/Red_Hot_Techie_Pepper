2008-07-25T03:46:00.000Z	ryknow_		ok I'll give that a shot. Also...while I have someone listening to me. =P When I go to preferences and click on Main menu, nothing happens.
2008-07-25T03:46:00.000Z	ryknow_		I just want to rearrainge how things are laid out in the main menua.
2008-07-25T03:46:00.000Z	ryknow_		menu*
2008-07-25T03:46:00.000Z	nickrud	ryknow_	try right clicking the menu itself, and choose edit
2008-07-25T03:47:00.000Z	nickrud	ryknow_	run   alacarte   in a terminal
2008-07-25T03:49:00.000Z	nickrud	ryknow_	now you know not to paste here :)  Put the output on paste.ubuntu.com
2008-07-25T03:54:00.000Z	nickrud	ryknow_	hm, let me look
2008-07-25T03:55:00.000Z	nickrud	ryknow_	looking for stuff.
2008-07-25T03:58:00.000Z	nickrud	ryknow_	  dpkg -l libasound2 , are the first two characters on the line you get back ii  ?
2008-07-25T04:00:00.000Z	nickrud	ryknow_	yes, that tells us some of the status of the package
2008-07-25T04:00:00.000Z	nickrud	ryknow_	should only be one line that matters, last one:  does that start with ii ?
2008-07-25T04:03:00.000Z	nickrud	ryknow_	ok, as I read your error output there's something wrong with some imports, and I think it's that package but could easily be wrong, I don't python. I'm going to check the bug tracker, brb
2008-07-25T04:07:00.000Z	nickrud	ryknow_	what version of ubuntu are you running?
2008-07-25T04:08:00.000Z	nickrud	ryknow_	have you added any sound packages recently?
2008-07-25T04:11:00.000Z	nickrud	ryknow_	everything I find about that error is about adding oss (and apparently removing alsa)
2008-07-25T04:12:00.000Z	nickrud	ryknow_	does 4front-tech.com mean anything to you?
