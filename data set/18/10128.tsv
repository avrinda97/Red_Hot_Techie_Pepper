2008-05-31T08:36:00.000Z	wepeel		Hi everybody. Fresh install of hardy on my laop top. Has anyone had trouble with flash being sloooow on ff3?
2008-05-31T08:37:00.000Z	wepeel		like, the maps on weather.com are really slow
2008-05-31T08:39:00.000Z	wepeel		cusious, however, it can't be my vid driver as everything else is wicked fast, right?
2008-05-31T08:39:00.000Z	wepeel		*curious
2008-05-31T08:40:00.000Z	wepeel		so, anyone had trouble upgrading to hardy from 6.10, ha.ha.
2008-05-31T08:40:00.000Z	wepeel		the machine I'm on now is running 6.10 and I think I'll upgrade or clean install. likely the second is best, no?
2008-05-31T08:41:00.000Z	Terrasque	wepeel	from 6.10 you have to do a lot of upgrades.. first to 7.04 then to 7.10 and then to 8.04 iirc
2008-05-31T08:52:00.000Z	Terrasque	wepeel	I've upgraded a 6.10, or upgrading to be exact. Working on upgrading to 7.10 atm. Lots of cruft hanging around, and it's going to need another upgrade before its at 8.04
2008-05-31T08:53:00.000Z	Terrasque	wepeel	and thats why having /home on a seperate partition is a stellar idea ;)
2008-05-31T08:55:00.000Z	Terrasque	wepeel	and under install, tell it to use your home partition for /home
2008-05-31T08:57:00.000Z	Terrasque	wepeel	good luck :) it should be just to select manual partition, select your root partiton, tell it to format it and use as root, select your home partition, tell it not to format it, and use it as /home :)
2008-05-31T08:58:00.000Z	Terrasque	wepeel	you might find some problems here and there.
2008-05-31T08:59:00.000Z	wepeel	Terrasque	notably in version changes? HTe two programs I use the most would have version jumps (ff and kile)
2008-05-31T09:00:00.000Z	Terrasque	wepeel	have no idea tbh. But those files wouldn't be touched if you went the long way (upgrading) either. So I guess the programs can handle it.
2008-05-31T09:00:00.000Z	Terrasque	wepeel	never tried that stund with a desktop tho, so can't know
2008-05-31T09:00:00.000Z	wepeel	Terrasque	fair enough. I'll give it a try tomorrow, thaks for the help
2008-05-31T09:01:00.000Z	Terrasque	wepeel	no problem, and once again, good luck :)
2008-05-31T09:01:00.000Z	wepeel	Terrasque	ty :)
