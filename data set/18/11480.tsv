2006-07-28T14:08:00.000Z	move		thx
2006-07-28T14:09:00.000Z	move		hmm, okay, one more question
2006-07-28T14:09:00.000Z	move		knowing nothing but the url, how can you download a file from an http server using console?
2006-07-28T14:09:00.000Z	move		is there a native command?
2006-07-28T14:09:00.000Z	eyequeue	move	sudo apt-get install wget
2006-07-28T14:10:00.000Z	eyequeue	move	wget http://url.here/path/file
2006-07-28T14:11:00.000Z	eyequeue	move	if you're a console fan, i'll second that recommendation for screen(1)
2006-07-28T14:12:00.000Z	eyequeue	move	screen has a billion features, don't get bogged down in the socs ... detaching/attaching is the big one, then i use it for cut/paste too, the rest are less common
2006-07-28T14:13:00.000Z	eyequeue	move	start with "pinfo screen" or "man screen"
2006-07-28T14:14:00.000Z	eyequeue	move	what you do is start a "terminal" inside screen, then run apps, then make more terminals if you want, etc
2006-07-28T14:16:00.000Z	eyequeue	move	start irssi in console, get x working, detach, come back in x and reattach to that irssi, and no one on irc even knew you left, all /msgs saved, it's sweet
2006-07-28T14:21:00.000Z	eyequeue	move	example,. detach from machine A, go to machine B and logon, and then attach to that machine, even though you never had it on that machine in the first place
2006-07-28T14:21:00.000Z	eyequeue	move	"exit" at the terminal
2006-07-28T14:22:00.000Z	eyequeue	move	there's a "kill" command too, but better to close things our properly :)
2006-07-28T14:25:00.000Z	eyequeue	move	while at it, i'll also mention ^A^[ and ^A^]  are my friends too :)  (cut/paste)
2006-07-28T14:26:00.000Z	move	eyequeue	great, thx
2006-07-28T14:26:00.000Z	eyequeue	move	always noce to give someone a new software toy, knowing there will be no productivity at the office for a week, lol
