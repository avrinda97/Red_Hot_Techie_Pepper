2010-08-27T22:51:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mickster04	It's normal for there to be no xorg.conf
2010-09-02T06:20:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mickster04	If it's happening when you connect for the first time it may be that your client is connecting to #ubuntu before it finishes identifying.
2010-09-02T06:21:00.000Z	mickster04	Jordan_U	i have connected to this channel loads, and i always connect before i identify, its never been a problem before
2010-09-02T06:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mickster04	Usually this channel doesn't require you to be identified, it only does now because of recent spam problems.

2011-02-22T11:00:00.000Z	mickster04	Jordan_U	can I fix it without reinstalling windows
2011-02-22T11:01:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mickster04	In the future, never install grub to a partition, always to the mbr. To restore the windows bootloader follow this guide: http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/bootinfoscript/index.php?title=Boot_Problems:Boot_Sector
