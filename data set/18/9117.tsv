2007-10-19T10:13:00.000Z	MasterShrek		yea
2007-10-19T10:14:00.000Z	MasterShrek		ah
2007-10-19T10:16:00.000Z	thedonvaughn	MasterShrek	you don't have to do that.  You just tell the installer not to format the partition in gparted
2007-10-19T10:16:00.000Z	MasterShrek	thedonvaughn	not if he wants a fresh install
2007-10-19T10:17:00.000Z	thedonvaughn	MasterShrek	i do it all the time, what do u mean?  You setup the partitions you setup your /home to be mounted, just not formated.  That way all the data in the /home partition is in tact.
2007-10-19T10:17:00.000Z	MasterShrek	thedonvaughn	if his /home dir isnt on a seperate partition
2007-10-19T10:18:00.000Z	thedonvaughn	MasterShrek	well then how can you unmount it?  You're the one who said that
2007-10-19T10:18:00.000Z	thedonvaughn	MasterShrek	unless i'm confused
2007-10-19T10:18:00.000Z	MasterShrek	thedonvaughn	forget it
2007-10-19T10:18:00.000Z	MasterShrek	thedonvaughn	u mount the original root partition, and delete all the other dirs /bin /etc /sys ... and then unmount it and start the install without formatting
2007-10-19T10:19:00.000Z	MasterShrek		mount
2007-10-19T10:19:00.000Z	thedonvaughn	MasterShrek	oh i see.  didn't realize /home wasn't on a seperate partition.  But yah in that case i'd go one more step and create another partition and copy /home to it then format over everything.. :)
2007-10-19T10:20:00.000Z	MasterShrek	thedonvaughn	yea, well i didnt know if his /home dir was on a different partition anyways, and i forgot who was asking too lol
2007-10-19T10:20:00.000Z	thedonvaughn	MasterShrek	heh
