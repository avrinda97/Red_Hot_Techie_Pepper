2008-01-08T09:45:00.000Z	gyaresu	bloodboy	What file did you download?
2008-01-08T09:46:00.000Z	gyaresu	bloodboy	Does your ISP have a free mirror? That is usually the case and they don't cap you for that.
2008-01-08T09:49:00.000Z	gyaresu	bloodboy	Does your ISP have a file mirror?
2008-01-08T09:49:00.000Z	gyaresu	bloodboy	With ubuntu on it?
2008-01-08T09:50:00.000Z	gyaresu	bloodboy	Ok. No offence but you don't sound like you need the 64bit version and you could do just fine with the normal cd not the dvd. Your ISP would also have the APT mirror by the sound of it so none of this would add to your bandwidth cap.
2008-01-08T09:52:00.000Z	gyaresu	bloodboy	Who is your ISP?
