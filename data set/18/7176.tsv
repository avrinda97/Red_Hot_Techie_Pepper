2009-06-10T06:37:00.000Z	grekkos_	rtnar	my grandmother is using ubuntu
2009-06-10T06:38:00.000Z	grekkos_	rtnar	compared to other linux distros, yes
2009-06-10T06:39:00.000Z	grekkos_	rtnar	runs fine on most modern machines
2009-06-10T06:39:00.000Z	grekkos_	rtnar	ran fine on my old 1.6ghz machine
2009-06-10T06:39:00.000Z	grekkos_	rtnar	but at the same time, the shitty laptop i have at work runs ubuntu w/flux worse than KDE runs on slackware
2009-06-10T06:40:00.000Z	grekkos_	rtnar	it's worth a try
2009-06-10T06:40:00.000Z	grekkos_	rtnar	This laptop is the only machine i've had problems with
2009-06-10T06:41:00.000Z	grekkos_	rtnar	without crazy compositing it ran perfectly fine on my old machine 1.67ghz with 1GB ram
