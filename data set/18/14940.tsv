2006-01-26T08:11:00.000Z	aTypical		Hi, thingfish.
2006-01-26T08:12:00.000Z	aTypical		Yes, I do. ;-)
2006-01-26T08:12:00.000Z	thingfish	aTypical	I was thinking I knew you from a certain #f--d--a channel.
2006-01-26T08:12:00.000Z	aTypical	thingfish	 I needed to try something other than Fedora.
2006-01-26T08:13:00.000Z	aTypical	thingfish	what are you doing here?
2006-01-26T08:13:00.000Z	thingfish	aTypical	I got that feeling long about FC3, after having been with red hat/fedora since rh7 something.
2006-01-26T08:13:00.000Z	thingfish	aTypical	haha me? an op in #fedora?
2006-01-26T08:14:00.000Z	thingfish	aTypical	no, not hardly.
2006-01-26T08:15:00.000Z	thingfish	aTypical	I've used debian sarge since about a year ago.
2006-01-26T08:15:00.000Z	aTypical	thingfish	nice.  I tried Debian, but it didn't like my hardware as much as Ubuntu (at least ACPI).
2006-01-26T08:15:00.000Z	aTypical	thingfish	I also tried SUSE, but it was too KDE for me. :-)
2006-01-26T08:16:00.000Z	thingfish	aTypical	oh I believe that.  Debian tends to like somewhat oldish hardware.  You have new computer gear?  I do hear Ubuntu handles new hardware on a peer with Fedora.
2006-01-26T08:17:00.000Z	aTypical	thingfish	yeah, it's a newer laptop.
2006-01-26T08:18:00.000Z	thingfish	aTypical	well sure, then.  new hardware requires either fedora or ubuntu, or perhaps debian sid if one is up to it.
2006-01-26T08:18:00.000Z	aTypical	thingfish	sid isn't up to the challenge.
2006-01-26T08:19:00.000Z	thingfish	aTypical	can't say I'm surprised.  sarge is such a good fit for me only because I have about 1.5 year old hardware.
2006-01-26T08:20:00.000Z	aTypical	thingfish	I still have Fedora (core 2) on a box at work and it's rock solid.  I'll keep Ubuntu on my laptop and SUSE on my desktop.  Gotta love the flavors of Linux. :-)
2006-01-26T08:21:00.000Z	aTypical	thingfish	amen to that.
