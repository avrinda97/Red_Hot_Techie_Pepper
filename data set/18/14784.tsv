2005-06-17T11:36:00.000Z	fossa		hi
2005-06-17T11:37:00.000Z	fossa		since ubuntu won't write to ntfs partitions, and winxp won't recognize linux partitions, i made a fat32 partition for transferring files. but windowsxp will only recognize ntfs. can i make it recognize the fat32? (don't flame pls)
2005-06-17T11:37:00.000Z	popey	fossa	no, xp DOES read fat32
2005-06-17T11:37:00.000Z	popey	fossa	did you create the fat32 with windows or linux?
2005-06-17T11:37:00.000Z	popey	fossa	under windows you can use fdisk to format as fat32
2005-06-17T11:38:00.000Z	popey	fossa	I had the same issue with an external USB hdd, use windows to make the fat32 part
2005-06-17T11:39:00.000Z	popey	fossa	thats odd
2005-06-17T11:40:00.000Z	popey	fossa	xp pro or xp home?
2005-06-17T11:40:00.000Z	popey	fossa	and you removed the partition and rebooted ? :D
2005-06-17T11:40:00.000Z	popey	fossa	then recreated?
2005-06-17T11:46:00.000Z	popey	fossa	what size partition?
2005-06-17T11:49:00.000Z	popey	fossa	yes, hence me asking what size part :)
2005-06-17T11:50:00.000Z	popey	fossa	create 4 10s?
2005-06-17T11:50:00.000Z	popey	fossa	best not to make monster ones, you lose lots of space in slack
2005-06-17T11:51:00.000Z	popey	fossa	to make a part that big it uses massive cluster sizes.., you're better off with 4x10GB parts
2005-06-17T11:53:00.000Z	popey	fossa	depends what kinds of files you're going to put on the disk
2005-06-17T11:54:00.000Z	popey	fossa	lots of small files, small cluster, small number of big files, big cluster
2005-06-17T11:54:00.000Z	fossa	popey	lots of small files
