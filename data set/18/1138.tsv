2011-05-28T05:30:00.000Z	Vonhinten		oh boy, another Atheros AR928x sufferer eh... I feel ya buddy
2011-05-28T05:31:00.000Z	desu	Vonhinten	:P You facing issues with Atheros as well?
2011-05-28T05:31:00.000Z	Vonhinten	desu	already worked through it :)
2011-05-28T05:31:00.000Z	desu	Vonhinten	Ah, how did you manage to fix it?
2011-05-28T05:31:00.000Z	Vonhinten		I missed what your issue was, are you just not able to connect?
2011-05-28T05:31:00.000Z	Vonhinten		and what type of machine?
2011-05-28T05:32:00.000Z	desu	Vonhinten	I'm able to connect, but it randomly refuses to receive packets.
2011-05-28T05:32:00.000Z	desu	Vonhinten	It's an Acer laptop running Ubuntu 10.10
2011-05-28T05:33:00.000Z	Vonhinten	desu	let me find the option
2011-05-28T05:34:00.000Z	desu	Vonhinten	Ah, thanks!
2011-05-28T05:38:00.000Z	Vonhinten	desu	disclaimer, this worked for me with a AR9285 in an Asus N53JF on 11.04, I don't know if it'll work with 10.10
2011-05-28T05:38:00.000Z	Vonhinten	desu	sudo echo "options ath9k nohwcrypt=1" > /etc/modprobe.d/conf
2011-05-28T05:38:00.000Z	Vonhinten		oops
2011-05-28T05:38:00.000Z	Vonhinten		mistyped
2011-05-28T05:38:00.000Z	Vonhinten		sudo echo "options ath9k nohwcrypt=1" > /etc/modprobe.d/ath9k.conf
2011-05-28T05:39:00.000Z	desu	Vonhinten	Something tells me this is an issue with the hardware that manages the encryption/decryption of WPA/WEP encrypted packets?
2011-05-28T05:40:00.000Z	Vonhinten	desu	that's one guess, I don't actually know what it does, but I found it on some web page related to this device, and it solved my issues :)
2011-05-28T05:40:00.000Z	desu	Vonhinten	Ah, alright. Thanks a ton! :)
