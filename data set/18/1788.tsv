2011-12-07T11:20:00.000Z	pers3us		what is the isues?
2011-12-07T11:20:00.000Z	pers3us		MahaVishnu?
2011-12-07T11:20:00.000Z	truepurple	pers3us	I can not get flash to work right
2011-12-07T11:26:00.000Z	pers3us	truepurple	can you tell me what is the problem you facing? i saw your paste, what is the issue?
2011-12-07T11:28:00.000Z	truepurple	pers3us	flash screens don't update right, scrolling up and down on the page fixes it, and settings option is grayed out, so messing with hardware acceleration like someone else suggested doesn't seem possible.
2011-12-07T11:28:00.000Z	pers3us	truepurple	basically, at the moment your flash is working, though not working correctly?
2011-12-07T11:29:00.000Z	truepurple	pers3us	yes
2011-12-07T11:31:00.000Z	pers3us	truepurple	idoubt nspluginwrapper is culprit here, i think Adobe released a version which supports 64bit
2011-12-07T11:31:00.000Z	truepurple	pers3us	ActionParsnip worth noting is that earlier version seemed to work fine, this flash problem came out of nowhere, but how can I use a earlier version if this is the case?
2011-12-07T11:32:00.000Z	truepurple	pers3us	Yes, I got the weblink, but I am told that flash plugin installer is the same
2011-12-07T11:33:00.000Z	truepurple	pers3us	I just reinstalled it, so I take it that is the latest, I read off a number and someone else said that is the version they have too
2011-12-07T11:34:00.000Z	pers3us	truepurple	this command dpkg --get-selections |grep flash
2011-12-07T11:35:00.000Z	truepurple	pers3us	flashplugin-installer install  flashplugin-nonfree install
2011-12-07T11:36:00.000Z	truepurple	pers3us	also paste.ubuntu.com/762497/
2011-12-07T11:40:00.000Z	pers3us	truepurple	if MahaVishnu's method doesn't solve your problem, you try installing it manually. after downloading from adobe =
2011-12-07T11:41:00.000Z	truepurple	pers3us	I was told it that was the same thing as the install flash plugin installer thing
2011-12-07T11:42:00.000Z	truepurple	pers3us	minus updates
