2010-01-11T09:22:00.000Z	Ahmuck		will the ubuntu netbook remix work on any pc or just netbooks?
2010-01-11T09:23:00.000Z	Ahmuck		thanx maco
2010-01-11T09:23:00.000Z	Ahmuck		the ubuntu remix, is a low hardware solution?
2010-01-11T09:24:00.000Z	mezquitale	Ahmuck	you can probably install remix on any pc but you would lose your mind LoL
2010-01-11T09:24:00.000Z	Ahmuck	mezquitale	how so?
2010-01-11T09:27:00.000Z	mezquitale	Ahmuck	netbook is meant for netbooks that dont have the hardware of a desktop---like for video cards for example, you will have issues with compiz, it's easy to configure your machine to work like ubuntu remix flavor, youll have problems doing the opposite: http://helpforlinux.blogspot.com/2009/04/try-ubuntu-netbook-remix-on-desktop.html
2010-01-11T09:33:00.000Z	Ahmuck	mezquitale	so netbook remix, as it appears and looks is what i'd get.  simple menus, simple interface, simple desktop?
2010-01-11T09:33:00.000Z	Ahmuck	mezquitale	- this - http://zeirus.files.wordpress.com/2008/06/ubuntunetbookremix_3.jpg - correct ?
2010-01-11T09:33:00.000Z	mezquitale	Ahmuck	if that is what you want on your desktop, yes, it is possible to configure your desktop like netbook remix, just follow the guide
2010-01-11T09:34:00.000Z	Ahmuck	mezquitale	my goal is to have a nice turn key solutions for older desktops that don't overlaod them, and are easy for seniors to use
2010-01-11T09:34:00.000Z	Ahmuck	mezquitale	this appears it would do the trick
2010-01-11T09:35:00.000Z	mezquitale	Ahmuck	go ahead and have fun, just dont hurt yourself
2010-01-11T09:35:00.000Z	mezquitale	Ahmuck	if you have an older machine I highly suggest you use xubuntu
2010-01-11T09:41:00.000Z	mezquitale	Ahmuck	the processors are running @ 1gig?  so they should be PIII or better, with 512 megs of ram?  xubuntu will do wonders on it
2010-01-11T09:41:00.000Z	Ahmuck	mezquitale	i've tried xubuntu, and it's slow
2010-01-11T09:41:00.000Z	mezquitale	Ahmuck	your next bet would be damn small linux but I haven't tried it though
2010-01-11T09:42:00.000Z	mezquitale	Ahmuck	you want to the mini distribution, like people have told you about
2010-01-11T09:45:00.000Z	mezquitale	Ahmuck	you should give puppy linux a try
