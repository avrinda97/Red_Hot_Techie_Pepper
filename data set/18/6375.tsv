2008-05-17T21:08:00.000Z	max__		I can't ping myself from other computers on the network.  Any Ideas?
2008-05-17T21:09:00.000Z	joombaga	max__	Do you have network connectivity?
2008-05-17T21:09:00.000Z	max__	joombaga	Well, I'm connected to a router, and the other 2 computers are connected to the same router with the same subnet/gateway.   Is that what you mean ?
2008-05-17T21:10:00.000Z	max__	joombaga	how do I add network connectivity?
2008-05-17T21:12:00.000Z	joombaga	max__	Does it say you are connected?  By default the network monitor applet is on the top panel in ubuntu, and it will say if you're connected.
2008-05-17T21:13:00.000Z	max__	joombaga	Yes I'm connected via DHCP.  my ip is 192.168.1.107 and I am trying to ping that from my other computers which are also 192.168.1.xxx    I assume I'm connected, as I'm on the internet right now.
2008-05-17T21:14:00.000Z	max__	joombaga	The icon says "Manual network configuration"
2008-05-17T21:14:00.000Z	max__	joombaga	I can ping google.com and I can ping my router, 192.168.1.1   and I can even ping the other computers.   But the other computers can't ping me
2008-05-17T21:15:00.000Z	joombaga	max__	it's possible that your computer is blocking icmp (ping requests).
2008-05-17T21:15:00.000Z	joombaga	max__	I'd have to do some searching to figure out how to fix that
2008-05-17T21:15:00.000Z	max__	joombaga	I have port 21 forwarded, and a ftp server installed (proftpd) and I cant ping port 21 either
2008-05-17T21:18:00.000Z	joombaga	max__	So you're trying to access an ftp share on this computer from the other two?  I haven't had any problems doing that on Hardy
2008-05-17T21:18:00.000Z	max__	joombaga	ftp and samba
2008-05-17T21:19:00.000Z	max__	joombaga	have ports forwarded, and still get connection refused.   do i need to open ports in iptables, I thought the daemon would do that for me?
2008-05-17T21:20:00.000Z	max__	joombaga	but since icmp isnt even working, it seems like all I have is WAN not LAN
2008-05-17T21:21:00.000Z	joombaga	max__	I don't know, I've only done it between computers that were on the same subnet through DHCP without port forwarding.
2008-05-17T21:21:00.000Z	max__	joombaga	Ok thanks, I'm starting to think it's the Windows computers that are at fault   =]
2008-05-17T21:22:00.000Z	joombaga	max__	I wouldn't be surprised.
