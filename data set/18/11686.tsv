2007-05-08T14:58:00.000Z	madman91	tarzeau	is there a way to get those sooner?
2007-05-08T14:59:00.000Z	tarzeau	madman91	get them from debian?
2007-05-08T14:59:00.000Z	madman91	tarzeau	how?
2007-05-08T14:59:00.000Z	madman91	tarzeau	use a debian repo?
2007-05-08T14:59:00.000Z	tarzeau	madman91	see packages.debian.org/package then download the source package and build it? install it?
2007-05-08T15:00:00.000Z	tarzeau	madman91	i don't think mixing debian and ubuntu repos is good
2007-05-08T15:00:00.000Z	tarzeau	madman91	but then i've never tried it
2007-05-08T15:00:00.000Z	tarzeau	madman91	i'm a debian user (sid)
2007-05-08T15:00:00.000Z	madman91	tarzeau	ok.. i think i will just use source tarballs
2007-05-08T15:00:00.000Z	tarzeau	madman91	you could also just add a deb-src line to your sources.list (see man page)
2007-05-08T15:00:00.000Z	tarzeau	madman91	telnet linuks.mine.nu for an example
2007-05-08T15:00:00.000Z	madman91	tarzeau	but they are still old?
2007-05-08T15:00:00.000Z	tarzeau	madman91	then use apt-get source pkg
2007-05-08T15:01:00.000Z	tarzeau	madman91	debian packages from sid? no they are very new, there's only experimental that seldomly has newer stuff
2007-05-08T15:01:00.000Z	madman91	tarzeau	but wont that source be the same version as the package?
2007-05-08T15:01:00.000Z	tarzeau	madman91	sure, but ubuntu is not the same like debian, so build it from source
2007-05-08T15:01:00.000Z	madman91	tarzeau	ok thanks!
2007-05-08T15:01:00.000Z	tarzeau	madman91	to see if the deps are fine, and if it builds and stuff
