2008-09-23T21:34:00.000Z	Lanlost	vonderer	yeah.. my microphone works fine
2008-09-23T21:34:00.000Z	vonderer		how have you made them work?
2008-09-23T21:35:00.000Z	Lanlost		I think I am going to fool around with this for a while
2008-09-23T21:35:00.000Z	Lanlost		I want to switch back to manually setting everything up instead of DHCP.. I must know why it won't work that way. Never know when I might need to connect that way
2008-09-23T21:35:00.000Z	Lanlost	vonderer	Uh.. It just worked for me. It's going to be dependent on a few things.. what soundcard you are using for the most part
2008-09-23T21:36:00.000Z	Lanlost	vonderer	it may be as simple as enabling mic boost. If you have multiple sound cards (one on-board, one PCI add on) that could affect it
2008-09-23T21:36:00.000Z	vonderer		lspci | grep Audio

2008-09-23T21:36:00.000Z	vonderer	Lanlost	there is no mic boost option for me (
2008-09-23T21:37:00.000Z	vonderer	Lanlost	searched for it everywhere
2008-09-23T21:37:00.000Z	Lanlost		Just open up alsa-mixer and screw around with the settings. If you have two sound cards enabled, like I said. Make sure you have selected the right one
2008-09-23T21:37:00.000Z	Lanlost	vonderer	ok.. go to your volume control thing
2008-09-23T21:37:00.000Z	vonderer		just one, and everything's enabled
2008-09-23T21:37:00.000Z	Lanlost	vonderer	can I message you in a private window?
2008-09-23T21:37:00.000Z	Lanlost		it's too hard to see what is going on here
2008-09-23T21:38:00.000Z	vonderer	Lanlost	of course
