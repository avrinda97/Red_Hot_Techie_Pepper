2006-03-23T11:19:00.000Z	revolutionary	phiber_optic	the port number must be specified, the port number must be appended to the ip so that your friends browser knows which port to access.
2006-03-23T11:21:00.000Z	phiber_optic	revolutionary	 it didnt work
2006-03-23T11:22:00.000Z	revolutionary	phiber_optic	yeah change the default port to somthing higher than 1024.
