2007-08-02T07:46:00.000Z	marnanel		I'm trying to upgrade a machine from dapper to feisty. apt-get seems to have got itself in a twist. When I run apt-get -f install it is trying to install "metacity" *and* "metacity-common", which try to install the same files and it dies with an error.
2007-08-02T07:46:00.000Z	marnanel		How can I tell it not to install one of them?
2007-08-02T07:47:00.000Z	craig_	marnanel	good luck.  Those were six or seven hours I'd like back-- I did it on two boxes last week.  Try the -f option.  I was able to finally pull out of errors between that command and updating
2007-08-02T07:47:00.000Z	marnanel	craig_	thanks. I am using the -f option though.
2007-08-02T07:48:00.000Z	craig_	marnanel	let me go through my bash history for the apt commands I ran.  brb
2007-08-02T07:49:00.000Z	marnanel	craig_	Ooo-- I think I *may* possibly have a solution
2007-08-02T07:50:00.000Z	craig_	marnanel	it's probably something retarded
2007-08-02T07:50:00.000Z	marnanel	craig_	I think that would be a good word for it :)
2007-08-02T07:51:00.000Z	marnanel	craig_	okay, I have told it to uninstall everything that depends on metacity, and everything that depends on that, and so on, by hand until they're all gone... and now it's finishing installing everything else
2007-08-02T07:51:00.000Z	marnanel	craig_	then I'll put them back when it's done
2007-08-02T07:51:00.000Z	marnanel	craig_	sheesh.
2007-08-02T07:51:00.000Z	craig_	marnanel	like when you hunt for two days to see why BIND doesn't work, only to find an extra semicolon or some such
2007-08-02T07:51:00.000Z	marnanel	craig_	Yeeees. Yes, just like that. :)
2007-08-02T07:51:00.000Z	craig_	marnanel	I'm working on a paste by the way
2007-08-02T07:52:00.000Z	marnanel	craig_	ok, thanks
2007-08-02T07:53:00.000Z	craig_	marnanel	try having a look at these.  http://rafb.net/p/2J4fWe34.html
2007-08-02T07:54:00.000Z	craig_	marnanel	thos eare in no particular order
2007-08-02T07:54:00.000Z	marnanel	craig_	thanks a lot :)
