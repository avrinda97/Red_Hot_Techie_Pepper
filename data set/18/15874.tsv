2005-02-05T08:45:00.000Z	LinuxJones	bretzel	don't tell folks that
2005-02-05T08:46:00.000Z	LinuxJones	bretzel	your running Hoary though right ?
2005-02-05T08:46:00.000Z	LinuxJones	bretzel	when did that get uploaded
2005-02-05T08:48:00.000Z	LinuxJones	bretzel	that kind of sucks you can't :(
2005-02-05T08:49:00.000Z	LinuxJones	bretzel	I only have 0.9.3
2005-02-05T08:50:00.000Z	LinuxJones	bretzel	no that's ok :D
2005-02-05T08:51:00.000Z	LinuxJones	bretzel	yes I am sure it's from another repo :D
2005-02-10T10:43:00.000Z	LinuxJones	bretzel	apt-get install synaptic
2005-02-10T10:44:00.000Z	bretzel	LinuxJones	yes I did :-) but it wasn't there before
2005-02-10T10:46:00.000Z	LinuxJones	bretzel	have you installed the linux-restricted-modules ?
2005-02-13T09:47:00.000Z	LinuxJones	bretzel	xorg + nvidia aren't working for me either
2005-02-15T09:46:00.000Z	LinuxJones	bretzel	you running hoary ?
2005-02-15T09:47:00.000Z	LinuxJones	bretzel	Not for me either I had exactly the same problem with a GF5200 graphics card
2005-02-15T09:48:00.000Z	LinuxJones	bretzel	I think I will just go back to Warty, and wait till new nvidia drivers come out
2005-02-15T09:49:00.000Z	bretzel	LinuxJones	But it is modules related - seems not hardware related ...
2005-02-15T09:49:00.000Z	LinuxJones	bretzel	It's nvidia driver problem for sure
2005-03-06T10:26:00.000Z	LinuxJones	bretzel	dpkg-reconfigure locales
2005-03-06T10:29:00.000Z	LinuxJones	bretzel	:)
