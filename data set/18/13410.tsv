2006-10-26T08:15:00.000Z	sethk	condorito	you can try turning off dma, or slowing it down.
2006-10-26T08:17:00.000Z	sethk	condorito	you can try disabling dma during the install
2006-10-26T08:17:00.000Z	sethk	condorito	what were you doing when you get that error?
2006-10-26T08:17:00.000Z	sethk	condorito	not installing?
2006-10-26T08:19:00.000Z	sethk	condorito	possibly you have an intermittent problem with your memory.  I've seen machines run for months between errors of that type.
2006-10-26T08:21:00.000Z	sethk	condorito	that's not a media issue
2006-10-26T08:22:00.000Z	sethk	condorito	intermittent problem
2006-10-26T08:23:00.000Z	sethk	condorito	I'd run the memtest86 (assuming you are on x86 architecture)
2006-10-26T08:23:00.000Z	sethk	condorito	memtest86 is a separate, stand alone memory tester that is independent of linux or windows.
2006-10-26T08:23:00.000Z	sethk	condorito	it is very good at finding intermittent memory problems.
2006-10-26T08:24:00.000Z	sethk	condorito	if you install ubuntu, memtest86 is also installed and added to your boot menu.  Is it on the live cd boot menu?  I'm not sure.
2006-10-26T08:25:00.000Z	sethk	condorito	ok.
