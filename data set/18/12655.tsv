2006-07-03T14:39:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	idefix	okay just a second please.
2006-07-03T14:40:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	idefix	okay let me start from the top. Your error means that the mail server will not let your host send emails through it (relaying denied). This is put in so that spammers can't use an email server to send out emails. Generally, you setup smtp authentication -- or add your host to the acl at the mail server to send email through it.
2006-07-03T14:41:00.000Z	idefix	fyrestrtr	ctrl+shift+s didn't work but menu>edit>prefs did then sending mail, checked Server requires authentication"
2006-07-03T14:42:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	idefix	depends on what you are using your host for? You are hosting what with them, a website?
2006-07-03T14:44:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	idefix	oh hrmm -- don't know then what could it be. Suggest asking the person responsible for the mail server.
2006-07-03T14:44:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	idefix	did you check 'Server requires authentication' ?
2006-07-03T14:44:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	idefix	and put in your username?
2006-07-24T12:57:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	idefix	because that's all the package maintainer told synaptic to do. Take it up with the person that made the package.
2006-07-24T13:18:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	idefix	sgml is the grand-daddy of html and xml and everything else derived from it.
