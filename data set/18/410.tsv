2012-02-26T07:54:00.000Z	Ernesto_		hello
2012-02-26T07:54:00.000Z	Ernesto_		i need help!
2012-02-26T07:54:00.000Z	Ernesto_		any body here?
2012-02-26T07:55:00.000Z	Ernesto_		How to transfer files from Ubuntu to Windows 7 via LAN Cable?
2012-02-26T07:56:00.000Z	Strav	Ernesto_	without a router, I don't think you can do it without fiddling with your ethernet cable.
2012-02-26T07:58:00.000Z	Strav	Ernesto_	once you have the cable sorted out, look for something like this http://www.fs-security.com/docs/connection-sharing.php
2012-02-26T08:01:00.000Z	Strav	Ernesto_	I think Ben64 is right, and you can quite easily modify a regular ethernet cable to create a crossover one.
2012-02-26T08:02:00.000Z	Ernesto_	Strav	And how's that?
2012-02-26T08:02:00.000Z	Ernesto_	Strav	how is that?

2012-02-26T08:11:00.000Z	Strav	Ernesto_	try to precisely describe what you wish to achieve.
2012-02-26T08:14:00.000Z	Strav	Ernesto_	do you have access to a desktop computer? (if you don't have an external storage, the fastest way to do what would be to take out your hd, and plug it on the desktop's motherboard)
2012-02-26T08:15:00.000Z	Ernesto_	Strav	no desktop pc!
2012-02-26T08:16:00.000Z	Strav	Ernesto_	if you have a partition you can put all your important data on, then there's no problem. Just be caraful on what you're going to format during the install.
2012-02-26T08:17:00.000Z	Strav	Ernesto_	(I mean: if you have an EXTRA partition)
2012-02-26T08:17:00.000Z	Ernesto_	Strav	the problem is, i can see different partitions in Windows 7 Repair Command Prompt using DVD, but GParted in Ubuntu Live 11.10 only shows 298 GB disk not the seperate 3 partitons i have.. Yet i can access these by mounting.
2012-02-26T08:20:00.000Z	Ernesto_	Strav	I wonder the same.. But the cmd prompt using Windows Dvd shows them.. both in LIST PARTITION & LIST VOLUME command
