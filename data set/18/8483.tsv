2007-08-11T15:40:00.000Z	lechack		Hello everyone ! I just did a bigmistake : i added noatime to my fstab options and now my root partitions is mounted as read only ! how can i fix this ?
2007-08-11T15:40:00.000Z	Falstius	lechack	did you only add noatime?
2007-08-11T15:41:00.000Z	lechack	Falstius	data=writeback
2007-08-11T15:41:00.000Z	Falstius	lechack	thought so, that's what you get for reading slashdot.  Remove the data=writeback (using a liveCD) and you'll be good.
2007-08-11T15:42:00.000Z	lechack	Falstius	: argh :p
2007-08-11T15:42:00.000Z	lechack	Falstius	: and if i have no cd drive ? there is no other solution ?
2007-08-11T15:43:00.000Z	Falstius	lechack	can you boot from usb?
2007-08-11T15:43:00.000Z	lechack	Falstius	: yes
2007-08-11T15:44:00.000Z	Falstius	lechack	get yourself a usb key and DSL, set it up and boot from that.
2007-08-11T15:44:00.000Z	lechack	Falstius	okay thanks :p
2007-08-11T15:45:00.000Z	lechack	Falstius	by the way do you have any tips to improve battery life that on't involve breaking the system ?
2007-08-11T15:45:00.000Z	Falstius	lechack	most of the time you could just remount / read only, but data=writeback won't allow remounting (with the -o remount option)
2007-08-11T15:46:00.000Z	Falstius	lechack	not really, just the usual stuff (frequency stepping, turning down the brightness, and you can make syslog not flush the cache)
2007-08-11T15:47:00.000Z	lechack	Falstius	okay thanks for the tip. And could you explain why it makes it read only ? i did read the mount manpage before turning on the option...
2007-08-11T15:48:00.000Z	Falstius	lechack	I didn't look into it really, I guess that option isn't supported by the ubuntu kernel.  If you read kernel trap, you can guess they're using the most recent kernel and probably some non-standard patches.
2007-08-11T15:49:00.000Z	lechack	Falstius	okay. thanks :)
2007-08-12T16:31:00.000Z	lechack	Falstius	Another big thank you for your time :) by the way how many people got owned by that stupid fstab trick ? x)
2007-08-12T16:33:00.000Z	Falstius	lechack	so far I know of 2 (and I always have a liveCD around for when I screw up)
