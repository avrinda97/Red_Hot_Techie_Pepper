2009-10-22T22:12:00.000Z	nibsa1242		How can I make my keyboard stop doing this: Iḿ äëéó . I just want to type a freaking quote mark!
2009-10-22T22:13:00.000Z	LjL	nibsa1242	switch the layout from US International to plain US
2009-10-22T22:14:00.000Z	nibsa1242	LjL	yes, Iǘ done that, Iḿ using english. I tried english USA and international english they both behave strangely.
2009-10-22T22:14:00.000Z	LjL	nibsa1242	there is no "english" layout, there is a US and a UK layout
2009-10-22T22:15:00.000Z	LjL	nibsa1242	are you sure you have changed the layout and not the system language (different things)?
2009-10-22T22:15:00.000Z	nibsa1242	LjL	the layout is ok. But it won't just do a ' or "mark. I have to press the "key and then spacebar.
2009-10-22T22:15:00.000Z	LjL	nibsa1242	yes, that's what a US International layout causes.
2009-10-22T22:15:00.000Z	nibsa1242	LjL	Iǘe tried USA International and USA neither work
2009-10-22T22:16:00.000Z	nibsa1242	LjL	maybe if I remove USA International from the list, even though USA is set as default?
2009-10-22T22:17:00.000Z	nibsa1242	LjL	I'm ok. That worked. so its a bug. If you have USA Int'l as an option, even if you set USA to default, you still get USA Int'l behavior.
2009-10-22T22:17:00.000Z	LjL	nibsa1242	uh, "default" doesn't mean "currently active"
2009-10-22T22:17:00.000Z	LjL	nibsa1242	the whole reason why you can have a *list* of more than one layout is so that you can quickly switch from one to the other
2009-10-22T22:18:00.000Z	nibsa1242	LjL	I set it as default, and then selected "Apply System-Wide"
2009-10-22T22:18:00.000Z	nibsa1242	LjL	there is no other obvious option to make the selected layout active.
2009-10-22T22:18:00.000Z	LjL	nibsa1242	it's probably a keyboard shortcut (i'm on KDE though so not sure which)
2009-10-22T22:20:00.000Z	nibsa1242	LjL	 seems like a papercut bug... I'll file it as such.
2009-10-22T22:21:00.000Z	LjL	nibsa1242	i don't believe it's a bug, but as you wish
2009-10-22T22:22:00.000Z	nibsa1242	LjL	paper cut = trivially fixable usability bug... its nonintuitive to add a layout, select it as default and then not have a way to make it active
