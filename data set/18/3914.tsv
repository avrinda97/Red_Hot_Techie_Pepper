2009-07-26T17:28:00.000Z	floating	richardcavell	VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation 82845G/GL[Brookdale-G]/GE Chipset Integrated Graphics Device
2009-07-26T17:28:00.000Z	richardcavell	floating	yep.  800 series
2009-07-26T17:28:00.000Z	richardcavell	floating	I've got a 900 series
2009-07-26T17:28:00.000Z	richardcavell	floating	so yours is crap and mine is boosted crap
2009-07-26T17:29:00.000Z	richardcavell	floating	the Intel drivers have undergone rapid development between the release of Jaunty and Karmic.  Karmic includes the latest versions, 2.8.0.  Jaunty is on 2.6.3.
2009-07-26T17:30:00.000Z	richardcavell	floating	glxgears frame rate has gone to five times the speed for me now, no joke.
2009-07-26T17:30:00.000Z	richardcavell	floating	And I used to get screen flickering and switching on and off when changing video modes.  Not any more.
2009-07-26T17:31:00.000Z	richardcavell	floating	Karmic has some bugs.  Apps crash regularly.  But they crash cleanly.
2009-07-26T17:32:00.000Z	floating	richardcavell	ok, yeah. I had some crashes yester5day after the install, but now I really haven't had much of them. Well, maybe i'm not using enough features :)
2009-07-26T17:32:00.000Z	richardcavell	floating	I trust that they'll fix all the major bugs before release
2009-07-26T17:33:00.000Z	richardcavell	floating	I've filed plenty of bug reports myself
2009-07-26T17:33:00.000Z	floating	richardcavell	ok
2009-07-26T17:33:00.000Z	richardcavell	floating	but the Intel driver support is *so* much better.  And the Mac support is better too.
