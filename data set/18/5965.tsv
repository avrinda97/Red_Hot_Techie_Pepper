2008-07-23T22:44:00.000Z	Mr_Duck		Hi, I'm trying to install ubuntu to my laptop as a dual boot. When I try to partition the drive using the partitioner on the Ubuntu disk, I get an error that says "Resize operation failure. An error occurred while writing the changes to the storage devices. The resize operation has been aborted."

2008-07-23T22:45:00.000Z	Mr_Duck	wols	I just did
2008-07-23T22:45:00.000Z	Mr_Duck		but when I try it again, i get the same error
2008-07-23T22:45:00.000Z	wols	Mr_Duck	then check that it actually did.
2008-07-23T22:45:00.000Z	Mr_Duck		what do you mean?
2008-07-23T22:45:00.000Z	wols	Mr_Duck	not defrag in ubuntu. defrag in windows!
2008-07-23T22:45:00.000Z	Mr_Duck		I did!
2008-07-23T22:46:00.000Z	wols	Mr_Duck	then use a better defrag program. E:g. get perfect disk trial and use that. it clears the free space
