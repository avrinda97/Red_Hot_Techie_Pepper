2005-06-29T08:56:00.000Z	sproingie	MidnightDevil	you need to edit the config file that webmin creates
2005-06-29T08:56:00.000Z	sproingie	MidnightDevil	the access stuff is like right at the top.  by default it locks out everyone
2005-06-29T08:57:00.000Z	MidnightDevil	sproingie	 miniserfv.conf right?
2005-06-29T08:57:00.000Z	MidnightDevil		miniserv*
2005-06-29T08:57:00.000Z	sproingie	MidnightDevil	yah that's it.  been a loooong time since i've used webmin
2005-06-29T08:58:00.000Z	sproingie		tho i'm sure RHEL has its own remote control panel thing
2005-06-29T08:58:00.000Z	sproingie		hell if i know what it is tho
2005-06-29T09:00:00.000Z	MidnightDevil		spo0nman:  what line should i look for exacly ?
2005-06-29T09:02:00.000Z	MidnightDevil	sproingie	what line should i exacly look for?
2005-06-29T09:02:00.000Z	sproingie	MidnightDevil	i really don't know
2005-06-29T09:02:00.000Z	sproingie	MidnightDevil	it should be well commented
2005-06-29T09:03:00.000Z	MidnightDevil		something like allow=127.0.0.1
2005-06-29T09:03:00.000Z	MidnightDevil		_?
2005-06-29T09:03:00.000Z	sproingie	MidnightDevil	that looks good.  if you hit your webmin on localhost, then you should be able to get in
2005-06-29T09:04:00.000Z	sproingie	MidnightDevil	if you use your hostname, you'll have to add your hostname's interface and/or local network as well
2005-06-29T09:04:00.000Z	MidnightDevil		yeap, it does, but i want to allow from any ip, should i add something like what?
2005-06-29T09:05:00.000Z	sproingie	MidnightDevil	i don't really know.  i don't have webmin installed.  you'll have to read the documentation
2005-06-29T09:05:00.000Z	MidnightDevil	sproingie	 ok, thanx :)
