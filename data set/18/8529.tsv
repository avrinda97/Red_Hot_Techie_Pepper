2008-12-24T15:39:00.000Z	MistDragn		hehe, so what makes ubuntu better than other dists? i would need one with an easy install
2008-12-24T15:39:00.000Z	MistDragn		yeah of course i'm not the one trolling
2008-12-24T15:40:00.000Z	MistDragn		if ur gonna do that stuff why not at least target a less educated user base..
2008-12-24T15:41:00.000Z	MistDragn		thats the main reason i dont use *nix as my primary OS.. drivers.
2008-12-24T15:42:00.000Z	MistDragn		but i would love to get at some raw packets >:>
2008-12-24T15:43:00.000Z	MistDragn		yeah i am a die hard winblose user and i haven't ever touched vista except when i absolutely had no choice
2008-12-24T15:43:00.000Z	MistDragn		well i am in the market to get a new pc after the holidays
2008-12-24T15:43:00.000Z	MistDragn		but in order to be sold on a *nix dist i'd need to know that i can still game with it
2008-12-24T15:44:00.000Z	MistDragn		just curious if ubunut can run pc compatible games or if i'd need a virtual machine
2008-12-24T15:44:00.000Z	MistDragn		and if so, how much a virtual machine would degrade performance
2008-12-24T15:44:00.000Z	The_Joe_	MistDragn	Wine/CrossOver/Cedega will _help_, but they're not perfect.
2008-12-24T15:48:00.000Z	The_Joe_	MistDragn	Open Source just means the Source is avaliable - "Free Software" does not mean free.
2008-12-24T15:49:00.000Z	The_Joe_	MistDragn	There probably is, you might even be able to get the source from somewhere and build it yourself
2008-12-24T16:05:00.000Z	The_Joe_	MistDragn	But it's winter "/
2008-12-24T16:06:00.000Z	The_Joe_	MistDragn	Watch out where those huskies go and don't you eat that yellow snow.
2008-12-24T16:09:00.000Z	The_Joe_	MistDragn	That would ask me to authenticate every time I log in
2008-12-24T16:13:00.000Z	The_Joe_	MistDragn	"Ubuntu" is Swahili(?) - it means "Humanity"
2008-12-24T16:17:00.000Z	The_Joe_	MistDragn	Wow you're fast O.o
