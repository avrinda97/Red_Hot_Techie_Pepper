2010-09-02T04:01:00.000Z	Maahes		......Where would I make a complaint about a stupid package resolution problem in apt?
2010-09-02T04:01:00.000Z	Maahes		wait.
2010-09-02T04:01:00.000Z	Maahes		nevermind
2010-09-02T04:01:00.000Z	Maahes		I'm an idiot
2010-09-02T04:01:00.000Z	Maahes		or at least I think I am
2010-09-02T04:02:00.000Z	Maahes		removing the metapackage ubuntu-desktop, does that then make apt want to delete my whole system any time I upgrade, etc?
2010-09-02T04:02:00.000Z	Maahes		like it used to?
2010-09-02T04:03:00.000Z	Maahes		eh.....oh well, I'll just play crawl without sdl tiles enabled
2010-09-02T04:04:00.000Z	latagore	Maahes	Crawl as in DungeonCrawl? =o
2010-09-02T04:07:00.000Z	Maahes	latagore	as in DCSS yep
2010-09-02T04:08:00.000Z	latagore	Maahes	D: Never heard of DCSS. To google!
2010-09-02T04:08:00.000Z	latagore	Maahes	I noticed. Didn't think I'd find another ASCII dungeon crawler :p
2010-09-02T04:09:00.000Z	Maahes	latagore	if you haven't checked out doomrl you should ^_^
2010-09-02T04:09:00.000Z	latagore	Maahes	My brother goes on it, haven't checked it out myself
2010-09-02T04:10:00.000Z	Maahes	latagore	doomrl is a really fun coffeebreak rl. Dwarf Fortress......is...well....dwarf fortress. The most complicated and hard roguelike around.
2010-09-02T04:11:00.000Z	latagore	Maahes	I've heard of it
2010-09-02T04:12:00.000Z	latagore	Maahes	I actually started it up once; took an hour to generate the world; way too long for me
2010-09-02T04:12:00.000Z	latagore	Maahes	Perhaps it's time for whispers
