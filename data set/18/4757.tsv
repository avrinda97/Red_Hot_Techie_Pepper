2010-05-15T14:33:00.000Z	funkey		thank you :)
2010-05-15T14:33:00.000Z	funkey		i will try my best
2010-05-15T14:33:00.000Z	funkey		ok i will tell you the problem again
2010-05-15T14:34:00.000Z	funkey		i actually just want to extract a 4 gb file on my flash drive, but that doesnt work because its a FAT32 file system
2010-05-15T14:34:00.000Z	funkey		and i cant just convert it, because ubuntu live is installed on it
2010-05-15T14:35:00.000Z	funkey		you mean the programm ext2 ?
2010-05-15T14:36:00.000Z	wildbat	funkey	you install a Live on USB~ so? live don't have any presonal data so just convert to ntfs and redo the live.
2010-05-15T14:36:00.000Z	funkey	Avocadobride	no i dont want, i want to acces with linux and windows, that means ext2 is not the right format
2010-05-15T14:37:00.000Z	funkey	Avocadobride	the file is already on the drive but i cant extract the file because its above 4gb
2010-05-15T14:37:00.000Z	funkey		and winrar says you have to change file system to NTFS
2010-05-15T14:37:00.000Z	wildbat	funkey	don't your computer have a Harddrive?
2010-05-15T14:37:00.000Z	funkey		yea
2010-05-15T14:37:00.000Z	funkey		4 gb left
2010-05-15T14:38:00.000Z	funkey		i need 8 gb because i will have to move the .rar files and then extract it
2010-05-15T14:39:00.000Z	funkey		ok it seems pretty complicated right? then its maybe the best just to make enough space free on the hard drive
2010-05-15T14:39:00.000Z	funkey		and move to the hard drive and extract there
2010-05-15T14:39:00.000Z	funkey		i only was a bit suspicious because you read on google that formating from FAT to NTFS is just 1 command
2010-05-15T14:39:00.000Z	wildbat	funkey	>.> y you have to move them , just extract to harddrive . thou you have to get your usb to ntfs to hold back the file . so y not just go ahead to convert your usb to ntfs?
