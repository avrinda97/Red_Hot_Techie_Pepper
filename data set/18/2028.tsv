2010-09-08T21:57:00.000Z	srini		what is MBR, Grub and Initramfs... How it is loading?
2010-09-08T21:58:00.000Z	xiaclo	srini	MAGIC ... your BIOS searches for the MBR at the beginning of your hard drive, and passes to it (a very small program) it then loads grub from your hard drive, grub then loads initramfs which is a very small version of linux, which loads the rest of your linux system
2010-09-08T22:02:00.000Z	srini	xiaclo	 is there be first stage and second stage in GRUB while booting?
2010-09-08T22:03:00.000Z	xiaclo	srini	yes, although grub technically uses stage 1, 1.5 and 2 ... stage 1 is in the MBR, stage 1.5 is loading the drivers to read the hard drive, and stage 2 is what you actually see, the grub program displaying your boot choices
2010-09-08T22:06:00.000Z	srini	xiaclo	 MBR has partition table..  fstab file?
2010-09-08T22:08:00.000Z	xiaclo	srini	related, but no ... the MBR does contain the partition table, the fstab is a list of what partitions to mount inside linux ... which is actually loaded by the initrd when loading linux
2010-09-08T22:25:00.000Z	srini	xiaclo	what are the main job of initramfs?
2010-09-08T22:28:00.000Z	xiaclo	srini	initramfs (or initrd) is a small linux kernel that loads into RAM and loads everything else .... it's main job is making the root filesystem accessible ... on some systems, that's easy, on others it needs raid drivers, or worse, with strange filesystems as well.  Once it has that loaded, it passes off to the real kernel, and that takes over and loads the rest of the system
2010-09-08T22:30:00.000Z	srini	xiaclo	then when the root f.s will be mount as rw while booting
2010-09-08T22:32:00.000Z	xiaclo	srini	the root filesystem initially will be mounted read-only, and during the boot process will be mounted read-write, after it has done checks to the filesystem journal to make sure it is intact ... because if it needs to check the filesystem, and it's read-write, it could damage it more
2010-09-08T22:34:00.000Z	srini	xiaclo	so the root partition will be mounted read-write using fstab file is it?
2010-09-08T22:35:00.000Z	xiaclo	srini	yes, but the root filesystem is also contained in the grub.conf to mount read-only, when it remounts it, it will use the options from the fstab
2010-09-08T22:36:00.000Z	srini	xiaclo	ok thank you very much
2010-09-08T22:40:00.000Z	srini	xiaclo	grub.conf using hd0 but fstab using sd1... so why sd0 is not in grub.conf
2010-09-08T22:41:00.000Z	xiaclo	srini	because grub just sees hard drives, it's getting information from the bios ... linux sees them as SCSI (sd) or IDE (hd) drives because it understands what controllers they are attached to
2010-09-08T22:43:00.000Z	srini	xiaclo	ok thanks. which one is load first /etc/inittab file or fatab ?
2010-09-08T22:55:00.000Z	xiaclo	srini	sorry, not ignoring you, just trying to find something for you ... inittab is definately loaded first and defines what init runs ... before it loads the first runlevel, it runs everything in /etc/rcS.d/ ... which includes a mountall script, S11mountall.sh in my system ... which mounts the filesystems
2010-09-08T22:56:00.000Z	srini	xiaclo	 my doubts are cleared thank u very much
