2007-02-24T08:56:00.000Z	Ironman273	cafuego	I'm trying to install java.  The instructions say to use su. You learn something new
2007-02-24T09:05:00.000Z	Ironman273	cafuego	Java is saying it's having dependency problems... :-S
2007-02-24T09:06:00.000Z	Ironman273	cafuego	I went back to synaptic and it says I have 2 broken packages in my system.  How do I fix them?
2007-02-24T09:08:00.000Z	Ironman273	cafuego	It said to search with the term "broken" and when I did it came up with "Synaptic Package Manager" and "Klean Sweep" (which is not installed)
2007-02-24T09:09:00.000Z	Ironman273	cafuego	Great.  I broke Ubuntu in less than 24 hours
2007-02-24T09:09:00.000Z	Ironman273	cafuego	Yes
2007-02-24T09:10:00.000Z	Ironman273	cafuego	it fetched 3Bytes
2007-02-24T09:11:00.000Z	Ironman273	cafuego	It still lists the same 2 packages under "broken"
2007-02-24T09:12:00.000Z	Ironman273	cafuego	"0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded."
2007-02-24T09:12:00.000Z	Ironman273	cafuego	But Java is installed :-/
2007-02-24T09:13:00.000Z	Ironman273	cafuego	OK.  It immediately went back to the command line.  BTW what dies sudo stand for?
2007-02-24T09:14:00.000Z	Ironman273	cafuego	But does it stand for something?
2007-02-24T09:14:00.000Z	Ironman273	cafuego	DO as in to do or doing something?
2007-02-24T09:15:00.000Z	Ironman273	cafuego	Java installed OK, even with the errors it gave me
2007-02-24T09:15:00.000Z	Ironman273	cafuego	even though it's installed already?
2007-02-24T09:17:00.000Z	Ironman273	cafuego	Well I'm about to run Azureus, so that'll tell me if the runtimes are installed but the browser plugin is definitely working
2007-02-24T09:19:00.000Z	Ironman273	cafuego	everything is working fine.  I've read that Brasero is a good burning software but it's not in the software packages.  Do I install that from their website?
2007-02-24T09:21:00.000Z	Ironman273	cafuego	Thanks, that helps!  Off to search for more software then...
