2011-08-12T23:27:00.000Z	urlin2u	Rehan	the install to a thumb will not be stable.
2011-08-12T23:21:00.000Z	urlin2u	Rehan	if it is a legit W7 ISO it is not a live environment but a install media, it also does not matter what order installed in.
2011-08-12T23:25:00.000Z	urlin2u	Rehan	you will not have luck with a thumb and window 7 install not designed for it and will break.
2011-08-12T23:26:00.000Z	Rehan	urlin2u	are you saying that i can't install win7 from a thumb drive?
2011-08-12T23:27:00.000Z	urlin2u	Rehan	from it yes to it yes but u=it will break, MS has it setup to not run a external thumb, or at least thats the generak consensus.
2011-08-12T23:28:00.000Z	urlin2u	Rehan	a beautiful dream but not a stable idea W7 on a thumb installed.
2011-08-12T23:28:00.000Z	Rehan	urlin2u	i'm not trying to have W7 installed on a thumb. I don't think you understand what I'm trying to do lol
2011-08-12T23:29:00.000Z	urlin2u	Rehan	I didn't think so, you can have multiple SO's on a thumb for install I posted a link to my favorite.
2011-08-12T23:30:00.000Z	Rehan	urlin2u	what about kv102t's idea of having two partitions and just having GRUB2 on the MBR and when it chooses the bootable partition that has the Win7 installer on it, it would boot like I had put a Win7 install dvd into the pc
2011-08-12T23:31:00.000Z	urlin2u	Rehan	the ISO is a install media not a live one.
2011-08-12T23:31:00.000Z	Rehan	urlin2u	i know its an install media. i want it to be an install media. not a livecd.
2011-08-12T23:33:00.000Z	urlin2u	Rehan	I have a 16 gig thumb that s full of ISO's for install=W7 and live cd of Ubuntu, bitdefender....etc.
