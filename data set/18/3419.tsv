2009-12-19T20:31:00.000Z	MASARUwota	Bookman	sudo mount /dev/sdb -t <FILESYSTEM> /<mountpoint>
2009-12-19T20:33:00.000Z	Bookman	MASARUwota	Ok, I'm lost here....how do I know the filesystem on the thumbdrive?
2009-12-19T20:34:00.000Z	MASARUwota	Bookman	you used it on windows?
2009-12-19T20:34:00.000Z	Bookman	MASARUwota	No windows
2009-12-19T20:34:00.000Z	MASARUwota	Bookman	just open up gparted, select the device, and check the type
2009-12-19T20:35:00.000Z	Bookman	MASARUwota	it does not show up in gparted
2009-12-19T20:36:00.000Z	MASARUwota	Bookman	change the device in gparted
2009-12-19T20:36:00.000Z	Bookman	MASARUwota	now it does
2009-12-19T20:36:00.000Z	MASARUwota	Bookman	what does it say?
2009-12-19T20:36:00.000Z	Bookman	MASARUwota	unallocated
2009-12-19T20:37:00.000Z	MASARUwota	Bookman	format it into something then =)
2009-12-19T20:38:00.000Z	Bookman	MASARUwota	which format?
2009-12-19T20:39:00.000Z	MASARUwota	Bookman	depends on what you want to use it for. large file storage? do you want it to be accesible in windows? etc
2009-12-19T20:40:00.000Z	Bookman	MASARUwota	I don't use windows anywhere.  I've chosen ext3
2009-12-19T20:40:00.000Z	MASARUwota	Bookman	thats a good, and really typical, choice =)
2009-12-19T20:40:00.000Z	Bookman	MASARUwota	And now it auto mounted!  Thanks so much for the help.  I will remember to go to gparted right away!
2009-12-19T20:41:00.000Z	MASARUwota	Bookman	np =)
