2006-04-14T05:13:00.000Z	Madpilot	pvd2006	you want to delete all the files but keep the directories intact?

2006-04-14T05:14:00.000Z	Madpilot	pvd2006	"rm -Rf" to get rid of the directories as well
2006-04-27T12:23:00.000Z	Madpilot	pvd2006	which version of Opera?
2006-04-27T12:24:00.000Z	Madpilot	pvd2006	8.5.4 is out, try that, then file a bug report with Opera - give them a sample URL if you can
2006-04-28T06:38:00.000Z	Madpilot	pvd2006	if you mean the w32codecs package, it should install itself
2006-04-28T12:51:00.000Z	Madpilot	pvd2006	Evince
2006-04-28T12:51:00.000Z	pvd2006	Madpilot	Evince gives me problems like, I can't copy test, and when I go over text it whites out the rest of the text.
2006-04-28T12:53:00.000Z	Madpilot	pvd2006	you can install Adobe Acrobat Reader - acroread - it's sometimes the best, although it's a giant bloated app...
