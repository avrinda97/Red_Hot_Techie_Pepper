2005-01-10T17:02:00.000Z	JDahl		cant knoppix do it?
2005-01-10T07:47:00.000Z	JDahl		I am thinking of getting an amd64 machine for numbercrunching at work... we almost exclusively buy Dell (who doesnt sell amd64). Any recommendations for other mainstream companies selling amd64 desktops that works well with Linux?
2005-01-10T07:49:00.000Z	nevyn	JDahl	other than dell and paqpaq (HP) who else is there.
2005-01-10T07:51:00.000Z	JDahl	nevyn	that's why I asked... a quick search through those companies only gave me some overprices servers with SCSI, and I cant be arsed to assemble a machine from pieces at work
2005-01-10T07:51:00.000Z	nevyn	JDahl	any way you can just buy it from a local reuptable pc company?
2005-01-10T07:52:00.000Z	JDahl	nevyn	only if I make a crusade.. we have special discount agreements with major companies
2005-01-10T07:53:00.000Z	nevyn	JDahl	sigh.
2005-01-10T08:00:00.000Z	nevyn	JDahl	amd64 is the new alpha
2005-01-10T08:01:00.000Z	nevyn	JDahl	you're going to end up win the workstation market with real vendors wanting to charge you $10K + for a system
2005-01-10T08:24:00.000Z	nevyn	JDahl	hp do amd64 desktops
2005-01-10T08:31:00.000Z	JDahl	nevyn	you're right, I missed that... They have a 3200+ with 2GB ram for less than $1500 without monitor (and I dont have to pay the mandatory $50 for XPHome, I always feel screwed when I do that)
2005-01-10T08:31:00.000Z	nevyn	JDahl	if you've got to do it through work it's probably the go.
2005-01-10T08:32:00.000Z	nevyn	JDahl	I'd feel better building it myself with a nice tyan board for that sort of money tho.
2005-01-10T08:32:00.000Z	nevyn	JDahl	I'd be happier if it wer a vectra.
2005-01-16T09:46:00.000Z	nevyn	JDahl	thankyou.
2005-10-28T07:39:00.000Z	nevyn	JDahl	it doesn't work with screen
2005-10-28T07:40:00.000Z	JDahl	nevyn	?
2005-10-28T07:40:00.000Z	nevyn	JDahl	sorry s/JDahl/Cens0red
