2007-02-28T08:23:00.000Z	giod		is there a way to set ubuntu to run a peice of code like every 5 minuets
2007-02-28T08:23:00.000Z	jlgaddis	giod	Yes, make a cronjob for it.
2007-02-28T08:24:00.000Z	jlgaddis	giod	"man 5 crontab"
2007-02-28T08:33:00.000Z	jlgaddis	giod	Crontab really is the easiest way.
2007-02-28T08:33:00.000Z	jlgaddis	giod	Crontab is really easy once you figure it out.
2007-02-28T08:33:00.000Z	giod	jlgaddis	it looks hard
2007-02-28T08:34:00.000Z	jlgaddis	giod	Write your code so that it will run "unattended", say it's called "myscript.sh", you just run "crontab -e" and add a line that says "*/5 * * * * /home/username/myscript.sh"
2007-02-28T08:34:00.000Z	giod	jlgaddis	can you help me set it up
2007-02-28T08:34:00.000Z	jlgaddis	giod	Save and exit and that's it.
2007-02-28T08:45:00.000Z	giod	jlgaddis	how will i know if the cron job worked
2007-02-28T08:45:00.000Z	jlgaddis	giod	Make it spit out an error if it doesn't, and you'll get an e-mail with any output.
2007-02-28T08:45:00.000Z	giod	jlgaddis	how do i do that
2007-02-28T08:46:00.000Z	jlgaddis	giod	You write your code correctly.
2007-02-28T08:46:00.000Z	giod	jlgaddis	what would that code look like please
2007-02-28T08:47:00.000Z	jlgaddis	giod	That, of course, depends on what you want it to do.
2007-02-28T08:50:00.000Z	giod	jlgaddis	how would i go about writing it were it saved all output to a file
2007-02-28T08:51:00.000Z	jlgaddis	giod	I don't mind helping you out, but I'm not going to write your scripts for you.  If you'd like to hire me or my company to do it, however, we can talk.
2007-02-28T08:51:00.000Z	giod	jlgaddis	sorry lol but i have no money
