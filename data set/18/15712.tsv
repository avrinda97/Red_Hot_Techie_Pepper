2005-04-14T15:30:00.000Z	SuperLag		If you're getting an error about a shared object not existing, how can you find out what package it belongs to?
2005-04-14T15:30:00.000Z	SuperLag		it's 3 lines... still want it in #flood?
2005-04-14T15:30:00.000Z	SuperLag		/usr/local/Adobe/Acrobat7.0/Reader/intellinux/bin/acroread: error while loading shared libraries: libgtk-x11-2.0.so.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
2005-04-14T15:31:00.000Z	SuperLag		and I have libgtk-2.0-0 and all of it's related packages installed already...
2005-04-14T15:31:00.000Z	mebaran151	SuperLag	you're not on 64 bit
2005-04-14T15:32:00.000Z	SuperLag	mebaran151	I am.
2005-04-14T15:32:00.000Z	mebaran151	SuperLag	there you go
2005-04-14T15:33:00.000Z	SuperLag	mebaran151	interesting... I can get it to work on Gentoo.
2005-04-14T15:36:00.000Z	SuperLag	mebaran151	agreed.  That's why I now have Ubuntu on this box.
2005-04-14T15:36:00.000Z	mebaran151	SuperLag	so do you REALLY need acroread
2005-04-14T15:36:00.000Z	SuperLag	mebaran151	though I'm still considering putting Gentoo back on here, and running it crippled, in pure 32-bit mode, as an Athlon-XP. :/
2005-04-14T15:37:00.000Z	SuperLag	mebaran151	No, but tell me... what other PDF reader do you know that renders PDFs as well as acroread? :)
2005-04-14T15:38:00.000Z	SuperLag	mebaran151	you run Ubuntu on AMD64?
2005-04-14T15:38:00.000Z	mebaran151	SuperLag	yep
2005-04-14T15:45:00.000Z	SuperLag	mebaran151	So are you a bit disillusioned with AMD64, like me? :/
2005-04-14T15:45:00.000Z	mebaran151	SuperLag	well I knew it would be this way
2005-04-14T15:45:00.000Z	SuperLag	mebaran151	It was this, or a Mac, and I thought I could get a LOT more power going this route...
2005-04-14T15:52:00.000Z	SuperLag	mebaran151	I think until the platform gets more mature, I'm stuck with running 32-bit
