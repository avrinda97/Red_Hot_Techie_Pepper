2006-06-17T08:14:00.000Z	IUnknown		is there a .NET interop plan for Linux?
2006-06-17T08:14:00.000Z	IUnknown		So, there's a C# in Linux?
2006-06-17T08:15:00.000Z	paniq	IUnknown	AddRef.
2006-06-17T08:15:00.000Z	paniq	IUnknown	now you cant go until i release you.
2006-06-17T08:15:00.000Z	paniq	IUnknown	HAHAHAHA.
2006-06-17T08:15:00.000Z	paniq	IUnknown	there is XPCOM for firefox, but honestly, COM is not required in linux
2006-06-17T08:16:00.000Z	paniq	IUnknown	in windows, COM primarily solves the problem of having to acquire classes of which one usually does not know where to find them
2006-06-17T08:16:00.000Z	paniq	IUnknown	in linux, all libraries can be found in /usr/lib, so why make it more complicated?
2006-06-17T08:17:00.000Z	paniq	IUnknown	see the mozilla page for that. they primarily use it for their own projects, and i dont think it makes sense to use it all through the system
2006-06-17T08:17:00.000Z	paniq	IUnknown	yes.
2006-06-17T08:17:00.000Z	paniq	IUnknown	its provided by libuuid, comes with a binary named uuid
2006-06-17T08:17:00.000Z	paniq	IUnknown	you call uuid and it spits out a new guid ;)
2006-06-17T08:18:00.000Z	paniq	IUnknown	as said, i dont think it is neccessary to make it any more complicated as it needs to be
2006-06-17T08:18:00.000Z	paniq	IUnknown	microsoft invented COM because they can afford it to produce complicated solutions...
2006-06-17T08:19:00.000Z	paniq	IUnknown	.NET works in linux and is called mono. large parts of the framework have been translated, with the exception of Windows.Forms, for which is gtk# in linux
2006-06-17T08:19:00.000Z	paniq	IUnknown	for more info, i suggest visiting gimpnet #mono
2006-06-17T08:19:00.000Z	paniq	IUnknown	yes
2006-06-17T08:20:00.000Z	paniq	IUnknown	gentoo requires all packages to be built on the client machine, which is unneccessary in my opinion.
