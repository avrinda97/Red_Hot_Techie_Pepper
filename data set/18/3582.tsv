2010-04-04T01:53:00.000Z	kevin_		How do I check which location (hd0,0) for example my XP installation is?
2010-04-04T01:54:00.000Z	jzacsh	kevin_	I don't understand your question. can you rephrase that?
2010-04-04T01:54:00.000Z	kevin_	jzacsh	im trying to add my XP installation to my grub.lst file, but I need to know the location of the disk.
2010-04-04T01:56:00.000Z	jzacsh	kevin_	did you try uncommenting the suggestd "windows" option in the grub config? (idk I might be talking about grub pre-version 2, thouhg).
2010-04-04T01:56:00.000Z	kevin_	jzacsh	im using 8.04
2010-04-04T01:56:00.000Z	kevin_	jzacsh	and there is no windows option
2010-04-04T01:57:00.000Z	kevin_	jzacsh	what happend was i did a kernal update, and then i lost my xp installation
2010-04-04T01:57:00.000Z	jzacsh	kevin_	do you know which config file I'm talking about?
2010-04-04T01:57:00.000Z	kevin_	jzacsh	are you talking about "menu.lst"?
2010-04-04T01:58:00.000Z	jzacsh	kevin_	/boot/grub/menu.lst yes
2010-04-04T01:58:00.000Z	kevin_	jzacsh	i dont see a windows option anywhere
2010-04-04T01:59:00.000Z	jzacsh	kevin_	scroll down to the green text and you'll see the one that starts with : "title Microsoft..."    --idk that this example is correct, but you didn't see anything remotely like this when viewing your menu.lst? http://boff.wordpress.com/2007/01/17/editing-bootgrubmenulst-to-change-the-grub-boot-menu/
2010-04-04T02:00:00.000Z	kevin_	jzacsh	this is my menu.lst file: http://pastebin.com/qGhiLjne
2010-04-04T02:03:00.000Z	kevin_	jzacsh	you know how you have to put (hd0,0) or something like that in the menu.lst file. well i don't remember which one my XP installation is. Im just wondering how I can find it.
2010-04-04T02:04:00.000Z	jzacsh	kevin_	I think the last time I did it I just tried a few different combinations
2010-04-04T02:06:00.000Z	jzacsh	kevin_	yes, i believe so
2010-04-04T02:06:00.000Z	jzacsh	kevin_	 0 0
2010-04-04T02:07:00.000Z	jzacsh	kevin_	but its not hda, its sd
