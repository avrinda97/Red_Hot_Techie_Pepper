2012-05-16T14:48:00.000Z	crizis	duppy	you might wanna try chromium/chrome
2012-05-16T14:48:00.000Z	crizis	duppy	it's a bit better with flash in linux
2012-05-16T14:49:00.000Z	crizis	duppy	try in chrome (or chromium)
2012-05-16T15:06:00.000Z	duppy	crizis	hangs up - like need to turn off you computer.
2012-05-16T15:06:00.000Z	duppy	crizis	did you try playing on facebook games?
2012-05-16T15:09:00.000Z	crizis	duppy	did you try chrome? i assume firefox was one crashing?
2012-05-16T15:09:00.000Z	duppy	crizis	both
2012-05-16T15:12:00.000Z	crizis	duppy	if you wanna try one more "easy" way, try chrome from googles repos (not chromium)
2012-05-16T15:12:00.000Z	crizis	duppy	i assume you thried chromium from software centre now?
2012-05-16T15:12:00.000Z	duppy	crizis	yup chromiom from software center.
2012-05-16T15:13:00.000Z	crizis	duppy	https://www.google.com/chrome/index.html try "real" chrome :) it ships with its own flash player
2012-05-16T15:13:00.000Z	crizis	duppy	no need to uninstall current one
