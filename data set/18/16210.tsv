2008-11-11T00:54:00.000Z	jmarsden	ambush276	Yes, you can run make from a command prompt.  No need to be root for that.
2008-11-11T00:55:00.000Z	jmarsden	ambush276	If you are using Eclipse, just run it (as a normal user) and then use its build stuff... just as you would use Eclipse under any other OS.
2008-11-11T00:57:00.000Z	jmarsden	ambush276	What is idlc doing in /usr/local/bin in the first place??  How did you install Eclipse?
2008-11-11T00:58:00.000Z	jmarsden	ambush276	Get rid of all that and install eclipse by doing    sudo apt-get install eclipse
2008-11-11T00:58:00.000Z	jmarsden	ambush276	so you get the Ubuntu packaged version :-)
2008-11-11T00:59:00.000Z	jmarsden	ambush276	Your Eclipse install is probably messed up?  sudo apt-get install eclipse
2008-11-11T01:00:00.000Z	jmarsden	ambush276	where it needs to be.  Then run it from your desktop menus.  Dn't worry abut details you don't need to know about
2008-11-11T01:01:00.000Z	jmarsden	ambush276	? You can use eclipse in pretty much any language.  Are you sure you know what Eclipse is??
