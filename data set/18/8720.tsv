2007-07-16T11:28:00.000Z	kikkomanchow		Hibernate > Suspend.. that is all kthxbye
2007-07-16T11:28:00.000Z	kikkomanchow		Id like to know is there a reason why anyone would go suspend rather than hibernate?
2007-07-16T11:29:00.000Z	kikkomanchow		i cant suspend my computer in my room.. cuz itd be too noisy with it on at night
2007-07-16T11:29:00.000Z	kikkomanchow		question: how do you look at running processes? how do you kill one?
2007-07-16T11:31:00.000Z	kikkomanchow		o.. didnt know theres a system monitor
2007-07-16T11:31:00.000Z	kikkomanchow		lol thx
2007-07-16T11:33:00.000Z	kikkomanchow		!compiz
2007-07-16T11:34:00.000Z	kikkomanchow		Can someone explain what relation between X and Gnome and Compiz and Beryl to me?
2007-07-16T11:34:00.000Z	Creeture	kikkomanchow	Sure. Do you have a good stiff drink in hand?
2007-07-16T11:34:00.000Z	kikkomanchow	Creeture	Tim Horton's coffee good enuf?
2007-07-16T11:36:00.000Z	Creeture	kikkomanchow	I guess it'll have to do. X interfaces with the hardware. It provides lots of functionality to provide graphics support. gnome is a little word to describe a whole lot of stuff that runs once X is running. compiz and beryl are two different 3d managers that control how the windows are displayed.
2007-07-16T11:38:00.000Z	Creeture	kikkomanchow	Gnome uses a "window manager" called metacity (or others, but metacity by default) to determine how the borders and menu bars look on the windows. beryl/compiz do the same thing only with a lot more prettiness
2007-07-16T11:38:00.000Z	kikkomanchow	Creeture	ah.. so compiz and beryl are essentially like a fork.. i heard they are merging?
2007-07-16T11:38:00.000Z	kikkomanchow		lol wtf.. did they think of a name for it yet?
2007-07-16T11:38:00.000Z	kikkomanchow		other than "Compiz fusion"?
2007-07-16T11:38:00.000Z	Creeture	kikkomanchow	compiz was the original, beryl was the fork, and they are in the process of merging again. Lots of harsh words spoken between the two.
