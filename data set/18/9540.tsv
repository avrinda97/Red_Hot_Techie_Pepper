2007-04-01T05:39:00.000Z	derrin		Hi...  I am an ubuntu noobie.  I just plugged in m DV camera (Panasonic NV-GS11) with firewire and my system is not recognising it.  Any ideas why not?
2007-04-01T05:41:00.000Z	Rug	derrin	what do you see when you type dmesg |tail in a term window?
2007-04-01T05:43:00.000Z	Rug	derrin	Yes type that and read the output.  Tell me if it says anything about your camera
2007-04-01T05:45:00.000Z	derrin	Rug	 no mentio of the camera...
2007-04-01T05:47:00.000Z	Rug	derrin	I have no firewire devices to test myself.  try:   lsusb
2007-04-01T05:47:00.000Z	derrin	Rug	 Wat do you mean by lsusb?  Usb post?
2007-04-01T05:48:00.000Z	derrin	Rug	USB port?
2007-04-01T05:49:00.000Z	Rug	derrin	type lsusb at the term window and see if your camera get mentioned
2007-04-01T05:49:00.000Z	derrin	Rug	various things mentioned...  but no explicit reference to the camera... some things anonymous, though...
2007-04-01T05:50:00.000Z	derrin	Rug	 I'll try unplugging to see if there is anything different?
2007-04-01T05:51:00.000Z	Rug	derrin	like I said I have no firewire equipment to see what it reports as.  do this:  dmesg |tail (and notice the output) unplug camera & dmesg |tail again (notice). Plug in camera dmesg |tail again  -=> something MUST showup about your camera
2007-04-01T05:52:00.000Z	derrin	Rug	exactly the same when I unplugged....  What were you trying to do with dmesg | tail  ?
2007-04-01T05:53:00.000Z	Rug	derrin	type that in your term window
2007-04-01T05:56:00.000Z	derrin	Rug	 when i unplugged, it told me:  [17183709.504000]  ieee1394: Node suspended: ID:BUS[0-00:1023]   GUID[00804580b12fb1bb] 
2007-04-01T05:56:00.000Z	Rug	derrin	that's good atleast your firewire port is working & supported
2007-04-01T05:58:00.000Z	derrin	Rug	 when i plugged in again, it told me:  [17183916.088000]  ieee1394: Current remote IRM is not 1394a-2000 compliant, resetting...
2007-04-01T06:06:00.000Z	derrin	Rug	 when i plugged in again, it told me:  [17183916.088000]  ieee1394: Current remote IRM is not 1394a-2000 compliant, resetting...
2007-04-01T06:13:00.000Z	derrin	Rug	 have I lost you?
