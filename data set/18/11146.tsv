2006-10-06T05:07:00.000Z	djuuss		to be able to implement your desktop into black and white (the game)
2006-10-06T05:07:00.000Z	djuuss		you can drag/drop/throw/stack your files
2006-10-06T05:08:00.000Z	djuuss		or teach your creature to sort your mp3 collection, heh, the possibilities.. anyway, </offtopic>
2006-10-06T05:08:00.000Z	Crippy-Boy	djuuss	I prefer i program i once had when using win, It took a screenshot of the desktop and allowed you to smash it with a hammer, have mites chew it up, chainsaw, flame throwser and other such stuff
2006-10-06T05:09:00.000Z	djuuss	Crippy-Boy	no i dont mean destroy it, i mean actual file organising, opening, using, in a 3d environment with a physics engine
2006-10-06T05:09:00.000Z	Crippy-Boy	djuuss	Ahh, Misread what you were saying, Aye thatd be pretty cool
2006-10-06T05:25:00.000Z	Crippy-Boy	djuuss	KTorrent? :P
2006-10-06T05:26:00.000Z	Crippy-Boy	djuuss	Crippleware?
2006-10-06T05:27:00.000Z	djuuss	Crippy-Boy	yeh i want functionality to add my own trackers, or only download some files in the torrent. Ktorrent doesnt do that, and azureus i really dont like
2006-10-06T05:28:00.000Z	Crippy-Boy	djuuss	KTorrent certainly does the latter, not sure about adding trackers
2006-10-06T05:28:00.000Z	Crippy-Boy	djuuss	No, far from it.
