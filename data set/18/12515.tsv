2006-04-09T09:45:00.000Z	Pritchard		Alright my CD-drive must not work. I wrote the ISO to it, turned Autorun back on, restarted my computer, and Ubuntu isn't installing.
2006-04-09T09:45:00.000Z	Yoric	Pritchard	have you set your computer to book from the CD ?
2006-04-09T09:45:00.000Z	Pritchard		To book from the CD? I don't believe I have ^_^;;
2006-04-09T09:46:00.000Z	Pritchard		Oh! Boot from the CD, right? Umm...I do that somehow lol. I haven't yet, but it's possible?
2006-04-09T09:46:00.000Z	Yoric	Pritchard	:)
2006-04-09T09:46:00.000Z	Pritchard	Yoric	:) (Do I know you?)
2006-04-09T09:46:00.000Z	Yoric	Pritchard	this would be better done from the BIOS.
2006-04-09T09:46:00.000Z	Yoric	Pritchard	I don't think so.
2006-04-09T09:46:00.000Z	Yoric		I'm just smiling at my "book" typo.
2006-04-09T09:47:00.000Z	Pritchard		Alright. Now I have to figure out what the BIOS is.
2006-04-09T09:47:00.000Z	Pritchard		*cough*
2006-04-09T09:47:00.000Z	Yoric	Pritchard	when you start the computer, you probably have access to a menu.
2006-04-09T09:47:00.000Z	Yoric		...
2006-04-09T09:47:00.000Z	Yoric		well, as [TechGuy]  says.
2006-04-09T09:48:00.000Z	Pritchard		Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
2006-04-09T09:48:00.000Z	Pritchard		So I reboot, press f2 or whatever, then go into boot from CD?
2006-04-09T09:48:00.000Z	Yoric		(actually, the appropriate term is "Bios Configuration Menu")
2006-04-09T09:48:00.000Z	Yoric	Pritchard	you'll probably have a menu offering to change many settings.
