2011-02-19T02:46:00.000Z	__nick		pls :(
2011-02-19T02:46:00.000Z	__nick		help me!
2011-02-19T02:46:00.000Z	tobier	__nick	just shouting for help is not the way to go..
2011-02-19T02:54:00.000Z	tobier	__nick	could you show me the tutorial you're reffering to?
2011-02-19T02:49:00.000Z	tobier	__nick	what errors do you get, if any?
2011-02-19T02:51:00.000Z	tobier	__nick	what tutorial? for installing Ubuntu?
2011-02-19T02:51:00.000Z	tobier	__nick	sorry, I just attached my screen, I have no idea of the history, I just saw your cry for help :P
2011-02-19T02:52:00.000Z	tobier	__nick	have you installed ubuntu and now it doesn't boot?
2011-02-19T02:55:00.000Z	tobier	__nick	please higlight me when you speak to me, or else I'll loose you..
2011-02-19T02:57:00.000Z	tobier	__nick	what model ID do you have?
2011-02-19T02:57:00.000Z	tobier	__nick	and I assume you're installing ubuntu 10.10?
2011-02-19T02:59:00.000Z	tobier	__nick	according the tutorial, you should've looked up your model id, and use the corresponding subpage for that model
2011-02-19T02:59:00.000Z	tobier	__nick	my guess is that you didn't; I'd advise you to start over
2011-02-19T03:01:00.000Z	tobier	__nick	from what I read, there may be a problem with GRUB messing up the MBR, which I think is what going on because you get an I/O error (possibly it means it can't find a bootable device)
2011-02-19T03:02:00.000Z	tobier	__nick	however, I have no experience with installing ubuntu on macbooks; my advice still is to start over and make sure you follow the steps in the tutorial
2011-02-19T03:02:00.000Z	tobier	__nick	other than that, I can't be of much help. sorry
2011-02-19T03:03:00.000Z	tobier	__nick	use rEFIt if you're dual booting
2011-02-19T03:07:00.000Z	tobier	__nick	are you talking to me? I said to highlight me; I almost have no chance seeing your messages otherwise...
