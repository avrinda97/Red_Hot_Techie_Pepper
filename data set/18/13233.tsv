2005-12-25T06:46:00.000Z	bookofjude		Yo! I installed kubuntu so that I could play around with it, and decided I disliked it. I don't want to uninstall it, though, I just want to change the default login screen from the kubuntu one to the ubuntu one, and not have to constantly select "gnome" from the session type drop down.
2005-12-25T06:46:00.000Z	bookofjude		Anyone able to point me in the right direction?
2005-12-25T06:46:00.000Z	Kyral	bookofjude	easy, hit session and find the thing that makes it default
2005-12-25T06:47:00.000Z	bookofjude	Kyral	I assume you mean "Session" in the login screen?
2005-12-25T06:47:00.000Z	Kyral	bookofjude	yah
2005-12-25T06:48:00.000Z	bookofjude	Kyral	There don't appear to be one.
2005-12-25T06:48:00.000Z	Kyral	bookofjude	on KDM?
2005-12-25T06:48:00.000Z	bookofjude	Kyral	Oh. Hang on, I'll reboot.
2005-12-25T06:52:00.000Z	bookofjude	Kyral	Hm. I must be blind. There's the "default" option in the drop down list, but I don't see an option to set something as a default.
2005-12-25T06:52:00.000Z	Kyral	bookofjude	select a session go into it. It SHOULD ask you if you want to set it as default
2005-12-25T06:52:00.000Z	bookofjude	Kyral	No round cyllindrical thing.
2005-12-25T06:53:00.000Z	Kyral	bookofjude	okay....sudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm
2005-12-25T07:02:00.000Z	bookofjude	Kyral	I think that worked. Thanks so much!
2005-12-25T07:02:00.000Z	Kyral	bookofjude	no prob
2005-12-25T07:02:00.000Z	bookofjude	Kyral	Now the real test: GDM or KDM on reboot? :D
2005-12-25T07:02:00.000Z	Kyral	bookofjude	no idea :P
2005-12-25T07:03:00.000Z	bookofjude	Kyral	Rhetorical question, sorry.
2005-12-25T07:04:00.000Z	bookofjude	Kyral	Jackpot. Thanks again.
