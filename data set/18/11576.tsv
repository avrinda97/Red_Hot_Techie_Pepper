2008-09-12T06:23:00.000Z	lepine		Hey guys, i'm having problems with the installer. on both of my computers, the language menu pops up. On my desktop, the keyboard seems frozen and i can't get out of it.Problem is, the alternate cd does NOT have a count down to  the installer as the normal cd does, so i'm essentially stuck there ...
2008-09-12T06:23:00.000Z	lepine		what can i do ?
2008-09-12T06:25:00.000Z	lepine		is there a way to remove the language menu from  the installer? or make it so it does NOT pop up by default?
2008-09-12T06:26:00.000Z	dr_willis	lepine	 ive noticed its a little over zelous at poping up. if you hit escape - it goes away. Back to the menu underneeth
2008-09-12T06:26:00.000Z	dr_willis	lepine	 this is on the alterive installer cd.  Not sure about the desktop installer.
2008-09-12T06:26:00.000Z	lepine	dr_willis	... thats my problem! on my desktop, my keyboard seems frozen during the menu.
2008-09-12T06:27:00.000Z	dr_willis	lepine	 Alt- installer cd? Thats odd...
2008-09-12T06:29:00.000Z	dr_willis	lepine	 Hmm..  ive seen some issues like this on  machines with using a USB keyboard. Got a PS2 keyboard? try one if you can.
2008-09-12T06:29:00.000Z	dr_willis	lepine	 i got one box. I cant do anything in grub with a USB keyboard. Gotta keep a PS2 handy for it.
2008-09-12T06:29:00.000Z	lepine	dr_willis	... damn Dell ... no more PS2!
2008-09-12T06:30:00.000Z	dr_willis	lepine	 if the bios stuff has the right menus. theres often a 'legacy usb' option in the  menus.
2008-09-12T06:30:00.000Z	dr_willis	lepine	 ,may want to try those
2008-09-12T06:30:00.000Z	lepine	dr_willis	 trying so now.
2008-09-12T06:31:00.000Z	dr_willis	lepine	 on my one machine. enabling that option made  both os's (linux an windows) not boot. :( so rember where it is so you can change it back if needed
2008-09-12T06:32:00.000Z	lepine	dr_willis	note taken.
2008-09-12T06:33:00.000Z	lepine	dr_willis	... no go ... any last ideas?
2008-09-12T06:33:00.000Z	dr_willis	lepine	 not really.
2008-09-12T07:23:00.000Z	lepine	dr_willis	in case you care, the best option seems to be to install 7.10, which does not have the usb problem i believe  ... (hoping that my current grub installation wasn't from an even earlier version)
