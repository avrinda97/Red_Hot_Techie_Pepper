2008-04-08T04:11:00.000Z	cjae		what  do I use for mp4 to avi conversion in ubuntu?
2008-04-08T04:12:00.000Z	BarryToeman	cjae	ffmpeg
2008-04-08T04:13:00.000Z	BarryToeman	cjae	"ffmpeg -i inputvideo.mp4 output.avi" of course there are hundreds of options, but that's the most basic command
2008-04-08T04:14:00.000Z	cjae	BarryToeman	thanks
2008-04-08T04:14:00.000Z	BarryToeman	cjae	what codec do you need for your avi file?
2008-04-08T04:15:00.000Z	cjae	BarryToeman	divx
2008-04-08T04:17:00.000Z	cjae	BarryToeman	will ffmpeg do divx
2008-04-08T04:18:00.000Z	BarryToeman	cjae	I'm not sure.  I don't use divx.  I'll look.
2008-04-08T04:19:00.000Z	cjae	BarryToeman	trying to read the man page online right now cause on win box
2008-04-08T04:22:00.000Z	BarryToeman	cjae	if the mp4 file is also using the divx codec you can just put that into an avi container.
2008-04-08T04:23:00.000Z	BarryToeman	cjae	ffmpeg will tell you the codec and container of a file: ffmpeg -i input.avi
2008-04-08T04:23:00.000Z	cjae	BarryToeman	how do you tell
2008-04-08T04:23:00.000Z	cjae	BarryToeman	oh I see
2008-04-08T04:24:00.000Z	cjae	BarryToeman	didn't think .mp4 used that
2008-04-08T04:25:00.000Z	cjae	BarryToeman	so .avi and .mp4 are just containing folders
2008-04-08T04:25:00.000Z	BarryToeman	cjae	kind of, .mp4 is the container format that can use various codecs such as h264 and MPEG-4 AVC, MPEG 2, etc
2008-04-08T04:26:00.000Z	cjae	BarryToeman	sorry folder should have said format
2008-04-08T04:34:00.000Z	BarryToeman	cjae	from ffmpeg faq: Both XviD and DivX (version 4+) are implementations of the ISO MPEG-4 standard (note that there are many other coding formats that use this same standard). Thus, use '-vcodec mpeg4' to encode these formats.
