2007-02-09T14:29:00.000Z	bruenig	quaal	I presume you mean edgy eft
2007-02-09T14:29:00.000Z	quaal	bruenig	ah yes
2007-02-10T06:03:00.000Z	bruenig	quaal	none of the programs from repositories go to /home/username
2007-02-10T06:03:00.000Z	quaal	bruenig	hmm
2007-02-10T06:03:00.000Z	quaal	bruenig	where do they go then? maybe those are just user settings i'm seeing there
2007-02-10T06:03:00.000Z	bruenig	quaal	generally /usr/local is meant for manual things
2007-02-10T06:04:00.000Z	bruenig	quaal	they are installed in /usr
2007-02-25T09:04:00.000Z	bruenig	quaal	compile it
2007-03-25T08:12:00.000Z	bruenig	quaal	it means that it can't read that file on your dvd, that there is some error, perhaps it is encrypted?
2007-03-25T08:12:00.000Z	quaal	bruenig	ok, didnt know i had to decrypt
2007-03-25T08:51:00.000Z	bruenig	quaal	what are dvd files in your mind?
2007-03-25T08:51:00.000Z	quaal	bruenig	.vob
2007-03-25T08:52:00.000Z	bruenig	quaal	it probably is a problem with encryption
2007-03-25T08:52:00.000Z	quaal	bruenig	do i need some kind of program then?
2007-07-21T08:49:00.000Z	quaal	bruenig	i said that for a suggestion from people.
2007-07-21T08:49:00.000Z	bruenig	quaal	I just put it up as a disclaimer
