2011-04-30T16:52:00.000Z	loseweight		how to save changes to a file using vi editor
2011-04-30T16:53:00.000Z	loseweight		it keeps making a .swap file
2011-04-30T16:53:00.000Z	loseweight		why?
2011-04-30T16:54:00.000Z	loseweight		and none of those commands work Sir
2011-04-30T16:54:00.000Z	loseweight		x
2011-04-30T16:54:00.000Z	loseweight		;
2011-04-30T16:54:00.000Z	loseweight		escape
2011-04-30T16:55:00.000Z	jrib	loseweight	if you don't want to use vi, use nano
2011-04-30T16:55:00.000Z	jrib	loseweight	ESCAPE:wq   in the future use nano
2011-04-30T16:55:00.000Z	jrib	loseweight	yes, it does.
2011-04-30T16:56:00.000Z	jrib	loseweight	press escape, then colon, then w, then q, then enter.
2011-04-30T16:56:00.000Z	jrib	loseweight	no?
2011-04-30T16:56:00.000Z	jrib	loseweight	then I recommend you start over in nano
2011-04-30T16:57:00.000Z	jrib	loseweight	close the terminal
2011-04-30T17:00:00.000Z	jrib	loseweight	close your terminal and do what you want to do in nano.
2011-04-30T17:00:00.000Z	jrib	loseweight	make them again
2011-04-30T17:01:00.000Z	jrib	loseweight	it's different
2011-04-30T17:02:00.000Z	jrib	loseweight	if you don't know how to use vi, I'd say nano is better
