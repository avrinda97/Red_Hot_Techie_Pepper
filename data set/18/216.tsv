2012-06-07T01:32:00.000Z	toafan_	u4ia74	that sounds intruiging.  I'm interested.  No idea how to go about searching for it, though
2012-06-07T01:32:00.000Z	toafan_	u4ia74	start by googling something like "Wuala alternatives"?
2012-06-07T01:33:00.000Z	toafan_	u4ia74	let's go looking
2012-06-07T01:36:00.000Z	toafan_	u4ia74	my guess would be something about too resource-intensive
2012-06-07T01:36:00.000Z	toafan_	u4ia74	wouldn't it be almost as simple to just host your own filelocker server?
2012-06-07T01:36:00.000Z	toafan_	u4ia74	(ie owncloud)
2012-06-07T01:39:00.000Z	toafan_	u4ia74	frankly, I have no clue what you're talking about.  All I know is that it sounds awesome, and it sounds like if bittorrent was a file-system
2012-06-07T01:39:00.000Z	toafan_	u4ia74	mark that as another search: bittorrent file-system
2012-06-07T01:42:00.000Z	toafan_	u4ia74	was thinking on how that could work, the uptime component would be pretty important
2012-06-07T01:49:00.000Z	toafan_	u4ia74	so http://maketecheasier.com/wuala-an-alternative-to-dropbox-with-security-in-mind/2011/08/15 is no longer acurate?
2012-06-07T01:49:00.000Z	toafan_	u4ia74	(I'm just reading online)
2012-06-07T01:57:00.000Z	toafan_	u4ia74	while (at a glance) I'd still say they're the best cloud drive option out there,  the trading feature sounds _epic_
2012-06-07T01:58:00.000Z	toafan_	u4ia74	the obvious solution is to write an open-source version
2012-06-07T01:58:00.000Z	toafan_	u4ia74	do you happen to know if any of their code was open-source?
2012-06-07T02:00:00.000Z	u4ia74	toafan_	I would agree, it is pretty awesome.  And no, I don't believe any of it was open source.  I wish I had more experience in such things or I'd ask Wuala if I could make use of it.
2012-06-07T02:00:00.000Z	toafan_	u4ia74	if they don't offer that anymore, is it really competition?
2012-06-07T02:03:00.000Z	toafan_	u4ia74	but it's a different 'service' -- they offer an (encrypted) "cloud thumb drive", we'd be trying to create "bit-torrent fs"
2012-06-07T02:05:00.000Z	toafan_	u4ia74	the biggest problem I can see, on the implementation side of things, is whether you'd need any centralized components...
