2005-10-21T09:23:00.000Z	ezrider_away	sn9	: i have apt-get the new kernel, what do I have to do now ? i think it's just unpacked
2005-10-21T09:24:00.000Z	sn9	ezrider_away	the kernel, and the linux-restricted-modules for it
2005-10-21T09:24:00.000Z	ezrider_away	sn9	: i did "sudo apt-get install linux-image-686-smp linux-restriced-modules-686-smp
2005-10-21T09:25:00.000Z	ezrider_away	sn9	: minus the quoting marks
2005-10-21T09:25:00.000Z	sn9	ezrider_away	after it finishes, reboot
2005-10-21T09:25:00.000Z	ezrider_away	sn9	: ok brb
2005-10-21T09:32:00.000Z	ezrider_away	sn9	: that didn't do it...
2005-10-21T09:33:00.000Z	sn9	ezrider_away	dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg to choose your correct video driver, fglrx or nvidia
2005-10-21T09:34:00.000Z	ezrider_away	sn9	: why would it work when I turn off the wireless if it's a video card problem ?
2005-10-21T09:35:00.000Z	sn9	ezrider_away	oh, it finished booting? i thought it wouldn't yet
2005-10-21T09:35:00.000Z	ezrider_away	sn9	: yes it booted, it doesnt work... the screen is down
2005-10-21T09:35:00.000Z	ezrider_away	sn9	: and i know everything'll be fine if i turn off the wireless and reboot
2005-10-21T09:36:00.000Z	sn9	ezrider_away	if the screen is down, it's not so easy to fully test the wireless
2005-10-21T09:36:00.000Z	ezrider_away	sn9	: but I can't configure it when it's not turned on while booting
2005-10-21T09:36:00.000Z	ezrider_away	sn9	: i got the wireless to work
2005-10-21T09:36:00.000Z	ezrider_away	sn9	: but when i reboot after the first boot, it won't work again
2005-10-21T09:38:00.000Z	sn9	ezrider_away	did you configure the wireless from the cmdline or network-admin?
2005-10-21T09:38:00.000Z	ezrider_away	sn9	: network admin
