2006-11-07T15:31:00.000Z	shinobi2		anyone have wireless working in 6.10?
2006-11-07T15:31:00.000Z	lastnode	shinobi2	what card/chipset?
2006-11-07T15:32:00.000Z	shinobi2	lastnode	atheos, ath0, was working in 6.06
2006-11-07T15:32:00.000Z	lastnode	shinobi2	out of the box?
2006-11-07T15:32:00.000Z	shinobi2	lastnode	yes, out of box
2006-11-07T15:33:00.000Z	lastnode	shinobi2	well i dont see why it wouldnt work on 6.10 then
2006-11-07T15:33:00.000Z	shinobi2	lastnode	well, it doesn't
2006-11-07T15:33:00.000Z	lastnode	shinobi2	that's weird, did you check the bug rpages?
2006-11-07T15:35:00.000Z	shinobi2	lastnode	nope, where's the bug page? i also updated the packages via eth0, wireless still no work
2006-11-07T15:38:00.000Z	shinobi2	lastnode	u think, i should uninstalled the restricted module then install it again?
2006-11-07T15:38:00.000Z	lastnode	shinobi2	yeah, maybe the restricted module you have isn't the correct one for your new kernel
2006-11-07T15:41:00.000Z	lastnode	shinobi2	what kernel are you running?
2006-11-07T15:41:00.000Z	lastnode	shinobi2	isn't that dapper?
2006-11-07T15:42:00.000Z	shinobi2	lastnode	yes, i have dapper on edgy on different partitions
2006-11-07T15:42:00.000Z	lastnode	shinobi2	come in on edgy, because that kernel version you showed me was dapper's
2006-11-07T15:43:00.000Z	shinobi2	lastnode	let me check the grub menu file wait.
2006-11-07T15:45:00.000Z	shinobi2	lastnode	Ubuntu, kernel 2.6.17-10-generic    that's what i have on edgy
2006-11-07T15:45:00.000Z	shinobi2	lastnode	can't come on from edgy, no wifi connection
