2012-04-30T09:29:00.000Z	nathaneltitane		i'm talking about unity running on compiz
2012-04-30T09:29:00.000Z	nathaneltitane		gnome 3 is gnome 3
2012-04-30T09:29:00.000Z	nathaneltitane		with or without shell
2012-04-30T09:30:00.000Z	nathaneltitane		unity being qt/compiz
2012-04-30T09:31:00.000Z	nathaneltitane		so yes.. compiz runs even on gnome 3
2012-04-30T09:31:00.000Z	nathaneltitane		you would probably get the best out of it by running on gnome classic session
2012-04-30T09:31:00.000Z	nathaneltitane		can someone help me here? i need someone who runs gnome-shell on ubuntu
2012-04-30T09:32:00.000Z	nathaneltitane		shell is an overlay to the desktop environment that unifies the DE's components into a fluid experience
2012-04-30T09:32:00.000Z	nathaneltitane		kde's plasma is a shell.. very modular
2012-04-30T09:32:00.000Z	nathaneltitane		gnome shell is monolithic.. with extensions as an option
2012-04-30T09:33:00.000Z	Tm_T	nathaneltitane	you need a help with what?
2012-04-30T09:33:00.000Z	nathaneltitane		manula ip can be set in network config

2012-04-30T09:34:00.000Z	Tm_T	nathaneltitane	you should tell what you need instead of asking what others have (:
2012-04-30T09:34:00.000Z	nathaneltitane		basically the modal dialogs are not held in place and do not swipe the way they should on stock or default behavior, even when forcing them to be atached through gconf Tm_T
2012-04-30T09:37:00.000Z	nathaneltitane	Tm_T	??
