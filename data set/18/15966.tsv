2005-03-05T06:54:00.000Z	mike998	thenuke	no better way to be a guru than to break stuff and fix it... i tell that to my students all the time
2005-03-05T06:54:00.000Z	mike998		that's how I got to be such a linux goat
2005-03-05T06:54:00.000Z	mike998		uhh gnu
2005-03-05T06:54:00.000Z	mike998		uhhh goat
2005-03-05T06:54:00.000Z	mike998		dammit
2005-03-05T06:54:00.000Z	mike998		guru?
2005-03-05T06:54:00.000Z	mike998		yeah...
2005-03-05T06:55:00.000Z	thenuke	mike998	that is true also
2005-03-05T06:55:00.000Z	mike998	thenuke	but seriously, I have run with FreeBSD for a while and that's how learned a lot of the stuff that I know now
2005-03-05T06:55:00.000Z	thenuke		and those backports might not be so unstable even as I thought, as I am reading more about it from here http://backports.ubuntuforums.org/
2005-03-05T06:56:00.000Z	mike998		the backports and hoary aren't all that unstable if you ask me... I have had some problems with OpenOffice crashing but that's it
2005-03-05T06:58:00.000Z	thenuke	mike998	and I would have no problem with unstable app, what I meant was that I would not like it at all if there would come some weird dependency problems whatsoever which then would prevent me from using X or so on :D
2005-03-05T06:59:00.000Z	thenuke		they did good job scaring me first ;) but as I read more, I think that there is not that much to worry
2005-03-05T06:59:00.000Z	mike998	thenuke	never had that problem
2005-03-05T07:00:00.000Z	thenuke	mike998	I had when I upgraded warty to hoary :)
2005-03-05T07:00:00.000Z	mike998		actually I DID have some problems with I enabled the nerim.net respositories
2005-03-05T07:00:00.000Z	mike998	thenuke	what repositories were you using>
2005-03-05T07:00:00.000Z	thenuke	mike998	defaults
