2009-04-30T05:33:00.000Z	evantandersen		i just started a patch command. How long should it take?
2009-04-30T05:35:00.000Z	evantandersen		HOW Long does a PATCH command take. My command line is just stalling after i started the command, is this normal!!!!!
2009-04-30T05:36:00.000Z	losher	evantandersen	you've done something wrong. Patch is fast, and usually noisy...
2009-04-30T05:36:00.000Z	evantandersen	losher	i downloaded the file then typed sudo patch 'pathtopatchfile'
2009-04-30T05:37:00.000Z	losher	evantandersen	patch --verbose < pathtopatchfile
2009-04-30T05:42:00.000Z	losher	evantandersen	look at the filenames in the patch, they need to match up with where you are & where the files to be patched are, if you see what I mean
2009-04-30T05:44:00.000Z	evantandersen	losher	where is my linux headers/source stuff. Like in the file it says: linux-2.6.28-rcl/drivers/hwmon/it87.c   is the path
2009-04-30T05:45:00.000Z	losher	evantandersen	/usr/src/linux I think. Also, source is not there by default, you have to install it by hand
2009-04-30T05:45:00.000Z	evantandersen	losher	i did
2009-04-30T05:46:00.000Z	losher	evantandersen	so how are the filenames written inside the patch file?
2009-04-30T05:46:00.000Z	evantandersen	losher	fixed it. It was trying to use an old version of linux kernel that I didn't have the source for.
2009-04-30T05:47:00.000Z	losher	evantandersen	good. One down. 350 million to go...
2009-04-30T05:48:00.000Z	evantandersen	losher	i thought that would fix it.. it didn't. Sorry i'm distracting you from 350 million. :)
2009-04-30T05:49:00.000Z	losher	evantandersen	you know what support is like - endless, thankless, soul-draining... So back to the patch, where are we?
2009-04-30T05:50:00.000Z	losher	evantandersen	wanna paste the top 10 lines of your patchfile to pastebin?
2009-04-30T05:53:00.000Z	losher	evantandersen	from the path in your patchfile, you need to be in /usr/src when you issue the command.
2009-04-30T06:10:00.000Z	evantandersen	losher	its a it8720 chipset patch, the mobos only started using it in Febuary. Its a new thing. its a file that sensors uses to check for compatible sensors.
2009-04-30T06:18:00.000Z	evantandersen	losher	okay i'll do that. Just not tonight. Thanks for all the help.
