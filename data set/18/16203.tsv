2004-11-01T09:17:00.000Z	radio_		hi, i just successfully installed the ubuntu release, now in order to get my wireless card working in need the module prism2_cs, which is not installed, i tried installing linux-wlan-ng from synaptic but it didn't have the module either, do i need to compile the module myself ? if so what is the ubuntu-way of doing that ?
2004-11-01T09:17:00.000Z	radio_		if someone could point me to a howto or in the right direction 
2004-11-01T09:19:00.000Z	_Hiro_	radio_	which card/chipset?
2004-11-01T09:19:00.000Z	radio_	_Hiro_	its a compact flash card that sits in a smaller sized pcmcia slot, prism2 
2004-11-01T09:20:00.000Z	radio_		prism2_cs has worked for me under gentoo
2004-11-01T09:21:00.000Z	_Hiro_		radio you need pcmcia-cs package + wlan-ng module I think
2004-11-01T09:23:00.000Z	radio_	_Hiro_	yes pcmcia-cs is installed, also wlan-ng package, it is just the module thats missing
2004-11-01T09:23:00.000Z	_Hiro_		I see
2004-11-01T09:23:00.000Z	_Hiro_		you could try to install host-ap :/
2004-11-01T09:23:00.000Z	_Hiro_		I think that also has drivers for prism2
2004-11-01T09:24:00.000Z	radio_	_Hiro_	yes it does, unfortunately prism2 does not work for me only prism2_cs does ;-)
2004-11-01T09:24:00.000Z	_Hiro_		too bad :|
2004-11-01T09:25:00.000Z	_Hiro_		did you try a find for the module? maybe it's placed incorrectly
2004-11-01T09:25:00.000Z	radio_	_Hiro_	yes i searched for it after installing, its not there
2004-11-01T09:25:00.000Z	_Hiro_		then I don't know, sorry :|
2004-11-01T09:27:00.000Z	_Hiro_	radio_	do you have a driver called wvlan-cs ?
2004-11-01T09:28:00.000Z	_Hiro_	radio_	http://lists.debian.org/debian-user/2002/07/msg03135.html maybe it'll help
2004-11-01T09:28:00.000Z	radio_	_Hiro_	no locate says no
