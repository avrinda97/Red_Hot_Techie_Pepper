2007-12-12T18:24:00.000Z	Zta		How do I make Sound Juicer use my MP3 profile for ripping music?
2007-12-12T18:25:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	Zta	You need to install the gstreamer0.10 ugly and bad multiverse codecs from synaptic.
2007-12-12T18:25:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	Zta	Restricted-extras would be good too
2007-12-12T18:28:00.000Z	Zta	Odd-rationale	I need *both* ugly and bad?  I have ugly installed.
2007-12-12T18:28:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	Zta	yes both, make sure you have multiverse, too
2007-12-12T18:31:00.000Z	Zta	Odd-rationale	both bad and ugly are installed.  I have multiverse.  Still SJ doesn't let me choose MP3 for output format.
2007-12-12T18:32:00.000Z	Zta	Odd-rationale	ah... "streamer0.10-plugins-bad-multiverse"
2007-12-12T18:32:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	Zta	exactly!
2007-12-12T18:32:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	Zta	Ugly too.
2007-12-12T18:33:00.000Z	Zta	Odd-rationale	ubuntu-restricted-extras is the meta package I need.
2007-12-12T18:33:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	Zta	Yes.
2007-12-12T18:33:00.000Z	Zta	Odd-rationale	it turns my cute Ubuntu into a dirty wh0re.
2007-12-12T18:33:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	Zta	sorry
2007-12-12T18:33:00.000Z	Zta	Odd-rationale	it's okay.  That's how I like it.
2007-12-12T18:33:00.000Z	Zta		Anything to get my mp3s
2007-12-12T18:35:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	Zta	Works now?
2007-12-12T18:35:00.000Z	Zta	Odd-rationale	yes.  It's great.  Thanks
2007-12-12T18:35:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	Zta	good
