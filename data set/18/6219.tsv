2008-06-05T22:02:00.000Z	Neurobuntu		Does anybody know what this error means, when building deb files? dpkg-genchanges: error: badly formed line in files list file, line 1
2008-06-05T22:03:00.000Z	Neurobuntu		If I use both dpkg-buildpackage and debuild I get the error
2008-06-05T22:04:00.000Z	_2	Neurobuntu	means the <packagename>.list  needs edited   line one is bad.
2008-06-05T22:05:00.000Z	Neurobuntu	_2	where is the <packages>.list file
2008-06-05T22:08:00.000Z	_2	Neurobuntu	o
2008-06-05T22:08:00.000Z	_2	Neurobuntu	i'm not sure when building.  but when installing it will go into  /var/lib/dpkg/info/
2008-06-05T22:09:00.000Z	_2	Neurobuntu	it's one of the dpkg control files.
2008-06-05T22:09:00.000Z	Neurobuntu	_2	oh ya... I'll check it out
2008-06-05T22:10:00.000Z	_2	Neurobuntu	along with  <name>.[pre|post][inst|rm] files
2008-06-05T22:10:00.000Z	Neurobuntu	_2	do you know what the files list file is supposed to look like
2008-06-05T22:11:00.000Z	Neurobuntu	_2	I found the file, I'm just not sure what it is supposed to look like
2008-06-05T22:11:00.000Z	_2	Neurobuntu	yes.   and you can look at any one of them in the /var/lib/dpkg/info/  dir to see examples.   it contains the list of files (with full path) that the package will install
2008-06-05T22:17:00.000Z	Neurobuntu	_2	he can ping both URLS and IPs, he can only open websites via the IP not the URL
2008-06-05T22:18:00.000Z	_2	Neurobuntu	yes. i missed that he could ping.   sorry for the bad dope.
2008-06-05T22:24:00.000Z	Neurobuntu	_2	is the file list file needed to build the deb?
2008-06-05T22:25:00.000Z	_2	Neurobuntu	umm i dont' know.  it has to be in the package after it's built... not sure about how it gets there.  ask someone that builds debs...  ;/
2008-06-05T22:26:00.000Z	Neurobuntu	_2	ok thanks
