2009-07-21T06:06:00.000Z	stanley_		I have it... Just need help actually creating the partition
2009-07-21T06:06:00.000Z	stanley_		I _really_ don't want to mangle anything
2009-07-21T06:07:00.000Z	stanley_		I have 4 partitions right now, winxp, boot, swap, and linux, i have 64GB of unallocated space i want to use to create a NTFS partition to share between the two drives
2009-07-21T06:08:00.000Z	arleslie	stanley_	you can do that by gParted
2009-07-21T06:10:00.000Z	arleslie	stanley_	do you have enough space for another partition?
2009-07-21T06:11:00.000Z	arleslie	stanley_	Do you have another unallocated space?
2009-07-21T06:12:00.000Z	stanley_	arleslie	 yea it shows that i have another unallocated space of 4.15MB
2009-07-21T06:13:00.000Z	arleslie	stanley_	then you can't use at as windows requires 4mb either before or at the end of a harddrive
2009-07-21T06:13:00.000Z	stanley_	arleslie	Well what can I do with the 64.26GB of unallocated space??
2009-07-21T06:14:00.000Z	arleslie	stanley_	do you 64 of free space or unallocated space?
2009-07-21T06:17:00.000Z	arleslie	stanley_	then you should be able to make a new partition as there is no limit on how many partitions you can have

2009-07-21T06:20:00.000Z	arleslie	stanley_	I don't see any reason why gParted won't let you make a new partition, what the error
2009-07-21T06:23:00.000Z	arleslie	stanley_	are you dual-booting with windows?
2009-07-21T06:23:00.000Z	stanley_	arleslie	yes
2009-07-21T06:27:00.000Z	stanley_	arleslie	thanks for posting htat
