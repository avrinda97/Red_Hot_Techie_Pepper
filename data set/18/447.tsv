2012-02-13T04:20:00.000Z	Dgameman1		I followed the wifi help docs all the way through, everything was working. no errors appeared. It's just that when I type iwconfig, nothing shows up for wlan0. it doesn't even appear
2012-02-13T04:20:00.000Z	aBound	Dgameman1	If your card worked out of the box for some other distro. Perhaps, it uses a newer kernel with built-in support for your card.
2012-02-13T04:21:00.000Z	Dgameman1	aBound	So is there anything I can do to fix that?
2012-02-13T04:21:00.000Z	aBound	Dgameman1	I'd check the kernel that whatever distro you were using and than check the current version of Ubuntu's kernel.
2012-02-13T04:21:00.000Z	aBound	Dgameman1	Some newer kernels might remove support for older hardware.
2012-02-13T04:22:00.000Z	aBound		Drivers are usually built into the kernel.
2012-02-13T04:22:00.000Z	aBound	Dgameman1	It's like using newer hardware on an older kernel more or less it won't be supported.
2012-02-13T04:29:00.000Z	Dgameman1		I did was st|ck said and it didn't work
2012-02-13T04:31:00.000Z	aBound	Dgameman1	You can check this site to see if it's supported: http://linuxwireless.org/en/users or the channel #linux-wireless
