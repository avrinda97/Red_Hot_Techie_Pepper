2009-03-10T22:22:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Incarus	wasn't that about 640k memory though?
2009-03-10T22:24:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Incarus	thatryan after install grub gives error 18 see http://wiki.linuxquestions.org/wiki/GRUB#Error_18 basically kernel outside BIOS's reach
2009-03-10T22:25:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Incarus	thatryan he says no, ubuntu only os on blank 20GB drive
2009-03-10T22:26:00.000Z	Incarus	ZykoticK9	he could try to format the 2 (!) gb.
2009-03-10T22:31:00.000Z	Incarus	ZykoticK9	no, isnt
2009-03-10T22:32:00.000Z	Incarus	ZykoticK9	good point
2009-03-10T22:50:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Incarus	what version of Ubuntu are you using?  my 8.10 doesn't even have that option, just a "Sharing Options"
2009-03-10T22:51:00.000Z	Incarus	ZykoticK9	9.04
2009-03-10T22:51:00.000Z	Incarus	ZykoticK9	jaunty
2009-03-10T23:07:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Incarus	what version of Ubuntu is stabler using?  if it's 8.10 then direct rendering is always YES (which doesn't really make any sense to me, would be nice to know if it's hardware or software rendering somehow)
2009-03-10T23:08:00.000Z	Incarus	ZykoticK9	no, direct rendering is not always yes!?
2009-03-10T23:08:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Incarus	in 8.10?
2009-03-10T23:08:00.000Z	Incarus	ZykoticK9	yes
2009-03-10T23:08:00.000Z	Incarus	ZykoticK9	dri is not the same as hardware rendering
2009-03-10T23:09:00.000Z	Incarus	ZykoticK9	dri = yes dont mean that you've got hardware rendering
2009-03-10T23:09:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Incarus	i'm actually repeating what someone else in the channel told me the other day - it didn't make much sense to me...
2009-03-10T23:09:00.000Z	Incarus	ZykoticK9	hm
