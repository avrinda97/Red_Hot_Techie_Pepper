2009-05-04T04:49:00.000Z	lingame22		so I want to look at a whole lot of porn on my new Ubuntu install, how do I keep my wife from finding all of it?
2009-05-04T04:50:00.000Z	powertool08	lingame22	password it
2009-05-04T04:50:00.000Z	lingame22		well we only want to have one account I have to keep it like a secret
2009-05-04T04:50:00.000Z	lingame22		but she'll know about it then
2009-05-04T04:50:00.000Z	lingame22		she's pretty bright she'll look at the logs
2009-05-04T04:50:00.000Z	powertool08	lingame22	add a . in front of the filename and its hidden, unless you have show hidden files turned on
2009-05-04T04:51:00.000Z	lingame22		she's used it a whole lot more than I have
2009-05-04T04:51:00.000Z	lingame22		"install": see, that would leave logs
2009-05-04T04:52:00.000Z	lingame22		I can't hide anything from her, I kinda want to look at like redtube, xtube, and *chan but like I can't clear the history either
2009-05-04T04:52:00.000Z	lingame22		I might have to just not use linux if you guys can't help me solve this :(
2009-05-04T04:52:00.000Z	lingame22		in fact I'm kinda getting there right now
2009-05-04T04:52:00.000Z	lingame22		hurry >_>
2009-05-04T04:52:00.000Z	lingame22	tha_infamous	google it
2009-05-04T04:52:00.000Z	lingame22		I can't do that
2009-05-04T04:52:00.000Z	lingame22		she'll look at the logs
2009-05-04T04:53:00.000Z	lingame22		is there anyway to crapflood the logs?
2009-05-04T04:53:00.000Z	lingame22		so it gets like wiped and i can just say we got hacked. linux is pretty insecure right?
2009-05-04T04:53:00.000Z	powertool08	lingame22	What are you going to do when she finds this convo in her logs? You know it is posted online...
