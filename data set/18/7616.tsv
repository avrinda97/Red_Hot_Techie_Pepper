2007-12-26T12:01:00.000Z	bluefoxx		well its not
2007-12-26T12:03:00.000Z	bluefoxx		its an asrock p4vm890, running the BIOS that came with it
2007-12-26T12:04:00.000Z	bluefoxx		i got it in may/june ish
2007-12-26T12:04:00.000Z	bluefoxx		well i would, but thats the problem
2007-12-26T12:05:00.000Z	bluefoxx		i need to backup to the SATA drive
2007-12-26T12:05:00.000Z	bluefoxx		XD
2007-12-26T12:05:00.000Z	lucian	bluefoxx	make a new partition and drag your stuff there
2007-12-26T12:07:00.000Z	lucian	bluefoxx	how big is your current hd?
2007-12-26T12:07:00.000Z	lucian	bluefoxx	if you have the extra space... it would probably be easier to make a new partition about 60 gigs to backup while you install 7.10 on the other partition
2007-12-26T12:11:00.000Z	lucian	bluefoxx	do you have a 7.10 cd or are you planning on downloading and burning?
2007-12-26T12:12:00.000Z	bluefoxx	lucian	downloading and burning, they didnt approve my free-CD request
2007-12-26T12:12:00.000Z	lucian	bluefoxx	well, you could just do a dist-upgrade which would update your current distro to 7.10 (if your on fiesty) and you wouldn't need to back any data up
2007-12-26T12:13:00.000Z	lucian	bluefoxx	then you could try hooking up the sata drive
2007-12-26T12:13:00.000Z	bluefoxx	lucian	i tried that once, it fried my main kernal
2007-12-26T12:13:00.000Z	bluefoxx	lucian	plus it took forever and an age
2007-12-26T12:13:00.000Z	lucian	bluefoxx	yes... it does take a very long time doing it that way
2007-12-26T12:15:00.000Z	lucian	bluefoxx	well... if you have another pc and a router or cross-cable you can back-up via ethernet...
2007-12-26T12:16:00.000Z	bluefoxx	lucian	i wont have another computer until around the first week of january, when i am getting a ubuntu-box from someone off of craigslist[whee, im not the only ubuntu user in vancouverXD]
