2008-02-04T02:34:00.000Z	sanzky		hi everyone. Does anyone knows how to pass the password as an argument to telnet?
2008-02-04T02:34:00.000Z	sanzky		I need to login automaticly without user intervention
2008-02-04T02:34:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	sanzky	what are you doing with telnet?
2008-02-04T02:35:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	sanzky	what's an RAS?
2008-02-04T02:37:00.000Z	sanzky	howlingmadhowie	its a device for allowing remote access to other devices in a lan
2008-02-04T02:38:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	sanzky	telnet doesn't define protocols for logging in and passwords. how you do that depends on the device you're connecting to
2008-02-04T02:41:00.000Z	sanzky	howlingmadhowie	well, then Im in a big problem, jeje
2008-02-04T02:41:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	sanzky	you have to work out what the device wants to hear. for example, a POP3 server wants to hear USER <username> and then PASS <password>
2008-02-04T02:42:00.000Z	sanzky	howlingmadhowie	Can I echo the user and password from another process?
2008-02-04T02:42:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	sanzky	i doubt it. when you telnet into the device, what do you see?
2008-02-04T02:43:00.000Z	sanzky	howlingmadhowie	a welcome message and a prompt asking for my username
2008-02-04T02:43:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	sanzky	which you then enter. and what happens then?
2008-02-04T02:44:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	sanzky	so you enter the password...
2008-02-04T02:44:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	sanzky	and everything works?
2008-02-04T02:44:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	sanzky	so what's the problem? :)
2008-02-04T02:45:00.000Z	sanzky	howlingmadhowie	I need to login automaticly, without typing anything. with a script or something
2008-02-04T02:45:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	sanzky	tricky but possible
2008-02-04T02:46:00.000Z	sanzky	howlingmadhowie	well, I'll keep trying. thanks for your help
