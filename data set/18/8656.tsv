2007-07-17T10:39:00.000Z	Frawgie		Ok, here's another one for ya now.  I try to use apt-get install <package> and it keeps telling it cant find one as if its not even trying to go out and find it.
2007-07-17T10:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Frawgie	It doesn't need to connect to the internet to check the list of available applications
2007-07-17T10:41:00.000Z	Frawgie	Jordan_U	it did all day yesterday though, it would go out and download the ones i needed and install them.  now its not even trying :(
2007-07-17T10:43:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Frawgie	What are you trying to install?
2007-07-17T10:43:00.000Z	Frawgie	Jordan_U	compiz/beryl
2007-07-17T10:44:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Frawgie	Feisty comes with Compiz installed and in earlier versions it is only available in Universe IIRC
2007-07-17T10:45:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Frawgie	Beryl is in Universe for Feisty also
2007-07-17T10:45:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Frawgie	Make sure you have the universe repository enabled
2007-07-17T10:46:00.000Z	Frawgie	Jordan_U	ok, here's what I am trying to do so you can slap me if needed...I saw a short video in youtube that was showing the guy rotating the 'cube' desktop without just clicking on the desktops in the corner.  How do I set that up?
2007-07-17T10:48:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Frawgie	Just go to System -> Preferences -> Desktop Effects
2007-07-17T11:11:00.000Z	Frawgie	Jordan_U	i installed the fusion version, but nothing works in it, so i have to turn it on or seomting? :P
2007-07-17T11:12:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Frawgie	Compiz Fusion is still very Beta
2007-07-17T11:29:00.000Z	Frawgie	Jordan_U	the compiz-fusion isnt working :( how do i go back to the way it was?
2007-07-17T12:16:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Frawgie	I have had a wireless interface show up as eth1
2007-07-17T12:17:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Frawgie	Yes
2007-07-17T12:22:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Frawgie	Just wondering, did he try the native drivers with firmware first?
2007-07-17T12:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Frawgie	I would suggest he does before trying ndiswrapper
