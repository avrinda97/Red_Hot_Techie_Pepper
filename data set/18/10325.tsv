2007-06-10T13:13:00.000Z	lynucs	ikonia	beat me, but i can't find any parameters there.. just the preference of palying only local files, all files, or nothing
2007-06-10T13:13:00.000Z	ikonia	lynucs	it is there, I'm not on an ubuntu box at this second so cna't look
2007-06-10T13:19:00.000Z	lynucs	ikonia	maybe you could mail me or sth when you're back on your ubuntu box and tell me wher i find it?? :D you mean open nautilus -> edit -> preferences? there are defenitely no parameters for how to execute the audio "prehear"
