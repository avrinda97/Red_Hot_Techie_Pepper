2006-11-19T16:39:00.000Z	AndiM	pfred1	default font dpi is a property of the X server, I'd say!?
2006-11-19T16:40:00.000Z	pfred1	AndiM	when i changed it I started from the console init 3 and just did it on the startx command with the -dpi switch
2006-11-19T16:40:00.000Z	pfred1	AndiM	it took me quite some time to be comfortable with gdms and I never bothered finding out very much about that
2006-11-19T16:42:00.000Z	AndiM	pfred1	well, X is "stable", but what if you have graphics card/driver issues? Then there still isn't a good fallback mechanism, right?
2006-11-19T16:42:00.000Z	pfred1	AndiM	ctrl + alt + F2 I guess
2006-11-19T16:43:00.000Z	AndiM	pfred1	uh, yeah, but that certainly isn't John Doe friendly ;)
2006-11-19T16:54:00.000Z	pfred1	AndiM	you're ALSA developer?
2006-11-19T16:55:00.000Z	AndiM	pfred1	let's say "interested developer" with development/additions for several sound drivers.
2006-11-19T16:56:00.000Z	pfred1	AndiM	I got this one sound problem I never figured out
2006-11-19T16:56:00.000Z	pfred1	AndiM	sometimes i get these "extra" controls in alsamixer and my system goes almost into a karoke mode
2006-11-19T16:56:00.000Z	pfred1	AndiM	where like the midranges drop out
2006-11-19T16:58:00.000Z	pfred1	AndiM	i have screeners someplace of alsamixer with the "extra" controls there and not there someplace
2006-11-19T17:00:00.000Z	AndiM	pfred1	yup, to protect boxes from exploding. ;)
2006-11-19T17:00:00.000Z	pfred1	AndiM	still freaks people out when they're like where's my sound?
2006-11-19T17:04:00.000Z	pfred1	AndiM	ALSA is sponsered by SuSE right?
2006-11-19T06:21:00.000Z	AndiM	pfred1	*very* wide support given how crappy/weak those chipsets are ;)
2006-11-19T06:22:00.000Z	pfred1	AndiM	ethernet is ethernet just set it and forget it is my motto
2006-11-19T06:26:00.000Z	AndiM	pfred1	heh, for endusers maybe, but tell that to server admins... especially with gigabit ethernets that are many things that can go wrong when choosing a cheap chip for a less-than-cheapo installation.
