2005-02-16T11:55:00.000Z	pussfeller		speaking of that, should i file a bug with warty not being able to auto install my azt2320 soundcard
2005-02-16T11:55:00.000Z	pussfeller		or just wait til the next release is out and check
2005-02-16T11:56:00.000Z	pussfeller		thats a good idea
2005-02-16T11:56:00.000Z	crimsun	pussfeller	does manually modprobing snd-azt2320 work?
2005-03-12T12:58:00.000Z	crimsun	pussfeller	/names
2005-10-16T05:39:00.000Z	crimsun	pussfeller	you can ignore that warning
2005-12-03T11:06:00.000Z	crimsun	pussfeller	yes, wget has a "follow" mode
2005-12-24T13:40:00.000Z	crimsun	pussfeller	paste all the output onto http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org
2005-12-24T13:42:00.000Z	pussfeller	crimsun	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/5931
2005-12-24T13:43:00.000Z	crimsun	pussfeller	that's not enough output. I need all of it from when you executed the command.
2005-12-24T13:43:00.000Z	pussfeller	crimsun	thats all i get, even if i use make debug, i can use make -d but its a ton of stuff, if you want
2005-12-24T13:47:00.000Z	crimsun	pussfeller	yes, -d will be helpful
2005-12-24T13:49:00.000Z	pussfeller	crimsun	i think i need to unbzip the linux source in /usr/src and make a symlink to usr/src/linux
2005-12-24T13:49:00.000Z	crimsun	pussfeller	no, don't create that symlink. That's the wrong way to go about it.
2005-12-26T14:49:00.000Z	crimsun	pussfeller	that'd be a bad idea, but don't let me stop you from hanging yourself with the rope that Ubuntu gives you.
2005-12-31T12:26:00.000Z	crimsun	pussfeller	yes
2005-12-31T12:26:00.000Z	crimsun	pussfeller	grep FUSE /boot/config-$(uname -r)
2005-12-31T12:45:00.000Z	crimsun	pussfeller	yes
