2012-06-24T18:29:00.000Z	simsu		hey i'm back
2012-06-24T18:30:00.000Z	simsu		hey fuchs there is now 6 Xorg.log files
2012-06-24T18:30:00.000Z	Fuchs	simsu	paste all of them, maybe?
2012-06-24T18:34:00.000Z	Fuchs	simsu	that's unfortunately nouveau again. Can you generate a new configuration file with  sudo nvidia-xconfig  on your real system?
2012-06-24T18:34:00.000Z	Fuchs	simsu	and then retry?
2012-06-24T18:37:00.000Z	Fuchs	simsu	because without them it's hard to say what causes the problem
2012-06-24T18:37:00.000Z	Fuchs	simsu	an alternative driver for nvidia hardware, which is in use currently on your system
2012-06-24T18:39:00.000Z	Fuchs	simsu	nouveau is installed by default
2012-06-24T18:40:00.000Z	Fuchs	simsu	well, with nouveau the problem is that it doesn't find any valid modes for your monitor
2012-06-24T18:41:00.000Z	Fuchs	simsu	and it then doesn't start up the graphical interface due to no valid screens found
2012-06-24T18:41:00.000Z	Fuchs	simsu	what kind of monitor is this, and how is it connected?
2012-06-24T18:43:00.000Z	Fuchs	simsu	and how is that monitor connected? Any adapters which might cause the EDID to be unreadable?
2012-06-24T18:45:00.000Z	Fuchs	simsu	is there one?
2012-06-24T18:48:00.000Z	Fuchs	simsu	then probably the EDID, where the monitor gives the driver information on what modes it supports, can't be read due to it.
2012-06-24T18:48:00.000Z	Fuchs	simsu	please try it without the adapter if possible. Else you have to specify vaild modes via modelines, as else the driver can't know what modes the monitor supports.
2012-06-24T18:48:00.000Z	Fuchs	simsu	nvidia falls back to default modes in this case, but you are currently using nouveau, not nvidia, and I don't know what it does in this case. According to your log: it fails.
2012-06-24T19:00:00.000Z	Fuchs	simsu	can I see a log file of it without the adapter, to check whether it still doesn't find any valid modes?
2012-06-24T19:01:00.000Z	Fuchs	simsu	that doesn't answer my question, unfortunately
