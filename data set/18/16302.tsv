2005-04-05T10:33:00.000Z	jack__		or, rather, how do I setuid root for sudo?
2005-04-05T10:34:00.000Z	jack__		I think I did chmod 777 /usr/bin when I was trying to install vmware, that might be the problem..
2005-04-05T10:34:00.000Z	jack__		what If i run into this kind of trouble again?
2005-04-05T10:35:00.000Z	jack__		-rwxrwxrwx    1 root     root        85496 2004-11-17 13:10 /usr/bin/sudo
2005-04-05T10:35:00.000Z	jack__		that's what it looks like

2005-04-05T10:37:00.000Z	crimsun	jack__	mount
2005-04-05T10:37:00.000Z	crimsun	jack__	join #flood, paste the output of mount
2005-04-05T10:39:00.000Z	crimsun	jack__	please join #flood and paste the output of mount
2005-04-05T10:42:00.000Z	crimsun	jack__	nope, I don't see anything wrong via your output from ,,mount''
2005-04-05T11:07:00.000Z	crimsun	jack__	you'd dist-upgrade
2005-04-05T11:09:00.000Z	jack__	crimsun	: do I do that dist-upgrade thing from the installation, or within my current system?
2005-04-05T11:09:00.000Z	crimsun	jack__	running your current warty system
