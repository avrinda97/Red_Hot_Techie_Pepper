2006-04-24T12:33:00.000Z	Sp4rKy		does anyone use swsusp2 and could says me what is the resume2 option
2006-04-24T12:35:00.000Z	johanbr	Sp4rKy	It tells susp2 which partition to use for reading/writing the memory image.
2006-04-24T12:35:00.000Z	Sp4rKy	johanbr	ok , but i've put "resume2=/dev/hdc10" on the kernel line of the menu.lst , hdc10 is my swap
2006-04-24T12:36:00.000Z	Sp4rKy	johanbr	and it doesn't works at startup
2006-04-24T12:36:00.000Z	johanbr	Sp4rKy	and you're using a custom kernel patched with suspend2?
2006-04-24T12:36:00.000Z	Sp4rKy	johanbr	yes , 2.6.16.5
2006-04-24T12:37:00.000Z	johanbr	Sp4rKy	There should be some suspend2 lines in syslog telling you why it didn't resume.
2006-04-24T12:38:00.000Z	Sp4rKy	johanbr	no :( but at the startup of the computer, i've some wrning like "resume2= not set correctly , plesase set t and restart before use swsusp2"
2006-04-24T12:38:00.000Z	Sp4rKy	johanbr	do you use swsusp2 ?
2006-04-24T12:39:00.000Z	Sp4rKy	johanbr	here is the exact line "Apr 19 07:28:47 localhost kernel: [4294667.296000]  Kernel command line: root=/dev/hdc6 ro quiet resume2=/dev/hdc10
2006-04-24T12:39:00.000Z	Sp4rKy		Apr 19 07:28:47 localhost kernel: [4294670.593000]  Suspend2 2.2.4: Missing or invalid storage location (resume2= parameter). Please correct and rerun lilo (or equivalent) before suspending.

2006-04-24T12:39:00.000Z	Sp4rKy		on the kernel line ?
