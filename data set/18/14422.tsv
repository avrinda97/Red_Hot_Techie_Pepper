2008-05-23T02:50:00.000Z	Lanlost		ah.. how the hell haven't I seen that acronym before?
2008-05-23T02:50:00.000Z	Lanlost		I've been programming since I was 4 years old thanks to my brother being 9 years older than me and making me type in Basic programs on our GS for his class
2008-05-23T02:50:00.000Z	Lanlost		and I'm 23 now.. and never seen "foss"
2008-05-23T02:51:00.000Z	Lanlost		I love having big channels like this.. but I need to start filtering out all of the people joining and leaving
2008-05-23T02:52:00.000Z	Lanlost		I've always wanted to code a new chat program that is backwards compatible with irc but organizes everything much differently
2008-05-23T02:52:00.000Z	Lanlost		the problem is.. no one's going to adapt a new chat standard when irc is available.. meaning I would have to make it backwards compatible
2008-05-23T02:52:00.000Z	Lanlost		I understand ..
2008-05-23T02:53:00.000Z	Lanlost		I'm just saying.. I want to create a filter because I don't want to block ALL parts and quits for everyone
2008-05-23T02:53:00.000Z	Lanlost		which is..
2008-05-23T02:53:00.000Z	Lanlost		isn't that a terminal client?
2008-05-23T02:54:00.000Z	puff	Lanlost	I use emacs as an irc client.
2008-05-23T02:54:00.000Z	Lanlost	puff	no you don't
2008-05-23T02:55:00.000Z	puff	Lanlost	Yes, I do.
2008-05-23T02:55:00.000Z	Lanlost	puff	well I use vnc to a computer with emacs and use that as an irc client
2008-05-23T02:56:00.000Z	puff	Lanlost	Actually, most of the time I ssh into a debian box and use emacs irc from there.
2008-05-23T02:56:00.000Z	puff	Lanlost	I'm using it directly from my desktop box now, because the debian box had a drive failure.
2008-05-23T02:56:00.000Z	Lanlost	puff	really? haha go figure...
2008-05-23T02:57:00.000Z	puff	Lanlost	Oh, ssh, screen, emacs, erc.  So I can detach and reattach.
