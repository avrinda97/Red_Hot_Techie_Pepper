2010-10-24T19:37:00.000Z	arrrghhh	rigved	your host os has to be 64-bit unless your chip supports hw virtualzation.
2010-10-24T19:38:00.000Z	arrrghhh	rigved	you can run x64 on 10.04... you just need what i said.
2010-10-24T19:38:00.000Z	rigved	arrrghhh	i am sorry, could you repeat that again
2010-10-24T19:38:00.000Z	arrrghhh	rigved	your host os has to be 64-bit unless your chip supports hw virtualzation.
2010-10-24T19:39:00.000Z	rigved	arrrghhh	what do i need
2010-10-24T19:39:00.000Z	rigved	arrrghhh	i have an x64 OS
2010-10-24T19:39:00.000Z	arrrghhh	rigved	i forget the terms.  amd is like hyper-V and intel is something else...  is your host OS not 64-bit?  then you should be fine...
2010-10-24T19:40:00.000Z	rigved	arrrghhh	i have intel dual core, Ubuntu 10.04 x64 and no H/W VT support
2010-10-24T19:40:00.000Z	arrrghhh	rigved	well if your host is x64, your guests should be able to run x64 as well...
2010-10-24T19:41:00.000Z	rigved	arrrghhh	that's weird, because there is no option to set the arch to x64 in my virtualbox
2010-10-24T19:44:00.000Z	arrrghhh	rigved	i'm assuming the OS you're installing is 64-bit...?
2010-10-24T19:44:00.000Z	rigved	arrrghhh	yes, it's ubunut-server 10.04 x64
2010-10-24T19:45:00.000Z	rigved	arrrghhh	i have it currently installed in qemu
2010-10-24T19:45:00.000Z	arrrghhh	rigved	are you running virtualbox from the repo's or from the DEB on the web page?
2010-10-24T19:47:00.000Z	rigved	arrrghhh	both i have tried...ose from repo and non-free from website
2010-10-24T19:47:00.000Z	arrrghhh	rigved	yea i didn't think there would be a difference with this feature between ose & non-free...
2010-10-24T19:49:00.000Z	arrrghhh	rigved	apparently i was incorrect.  virtualbox only supported x64 guests if your chip supports hw virtualization... that's a shame.
