2007-07-29T14:43:00.000Z	__david		hello, I'm having a really savage problem: my f_ keys won't work when I hold other modifiers down.  I.E. alt-f4, shift-f9...none of them work!  What could be the problem?
2007-07-29T14:44:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	__david	what keymap are you using?
2007-07-29T14:45:00.000Z	__david	fyrestrtr	i've been switching keymaps a lot the past week..I have dvorak now, but i've used english and turkish too
2007-07-29T14:45:00.000Z	__david	fyrestrtr	also, sometimes "alt" seems to get stuck
2007-07-29T14:45:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	__david	stuck? like it won't toggle?
2007-07-29T14:46:00.000Z	__david	fyrestrtr	i.e. I hit alt-drag to move a window, and then alt doesn't release when I release the key.  I have to hit alt again to register the keyrelease
2007-07-29T14:47:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	__david	there is an option in keyboard settings (somewhere, can't recall now) that makes the alt, super, ctrl keys 'sticky' -- maybe you enabled that by mistake?
2007-07-29T14:48:00.000Z	__david	fyrestrtr	I have all the defaults in the keyboard preferences, and that still doesn't explain why alt-f4 doesn't work
2007-07-29T14:48:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	__david	you got me.
2007-07-29T14:49:00.000Z	__david	fyrestrtr	the same problem happens with my other window managers
2007-07-29T15:02:00.000Z	__david	fyrestrtr	A reboot solved it.  It's too bad I don't know the cause, tho
2007-07-29T15:03:00.000Z	__david	fyrestrtr	did you use the azureus from aptitude, or did you download the sun-java one from azureus's website
2007-07-29T15:04:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	__david	I haven't tainted my system with java yet.
2007-07-29T15:04:00.000Z	__david	fyrestrtr	it's oss now!
2007-07-29T15:04:00.000Z	__david	fyrestrtr	sun java with azureus is much better. It actually works
2007-07-29T15:04:00.000Z	__david	fyrestrtr	the gcj impl. is kind of weak, imo.  It also lacks many of the impt. plugins.
2007-07-29T15:05:00.000Z	__david	fyrestrtr	I don't know what kind of network you're on, but for me, on my college network, azureus's encryption, peerguardian, and dht are impt. to not getting caught.  If that's a concern for you, don't forget it.
2007-07-29T15:06:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	__david	I'm in Kuwait.
