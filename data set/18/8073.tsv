2008-06-29T07:06:00.000Z	speart		hi
2008-06-29T07:07:00.000Z	speart		it's just me or the 8.04 Xorg is buggy? I can't install ATi Catalyst
2008-06-29T07:08:00.000Z	speart		IMHO there is just no reason to upgrade
2008-06-29T07:10:00.000Z	speart		I get a problems with debian symbols on 8.04 when installing ATI driver
2008-06-29T07:11:00.000Z	speart		ATI driver ANYONE?
2008-06-29T07:13:00.000Z	crdlb	speart	how exactly are you installing the ATI driver?
2008-06-29T07:13:00.000Z	speart	crdlb	by generating a package
2008-06-29T07:13:00.000Z	speart	crdlb	but it gives me a error related to xorg
2008-06-29T07:14:00.000Z	crdlb	speart	any reason why you're not using the hardware drivers manager / xorg-driver-fglrx ?
2008-06-29T07:15:00.000Z	speart	crdlb	the prop driver supports video better
2008-06-29T07:15:00.000Z	crdlb	speart	it's the same driver
2008-06-29T07:16:00.000Z	speart	crdlb	it's 8.3 no?
2008-06-29T07:16:00.000Z	crdlb	speart	so?
2008-06-29T07:18:00.000Z	speart	crdlb	but for some reason I can install them on 7.10
2008-06-29T07:19:00.000Z	speart	crdlb	I have a 3870 card and I think that 8.4 or 8.5 gives me a better support for my card
2008-06-29T07:19:00.000Z	crdlb	speart	you're using gutsy?
2008-06-29T07:20:00.000Z	crdlb	speart	8.04 (hardy) is the one that has fglrx 8-3
2008-06-29T07:22:00.000Z	crdlb	speart	you've lost me. You're on gutsy having trouble installing fglrx from the ATI site on gutsy, yet you can install it without any issues on gutsy?
