2007-12-25T13:50:00.000Z	bqmassey		i'm looking at a "minimum requirements" list for a program i want to install.. what's the best way to see if i have them all?
2007-12-25T13:51:00.000Z	Benalex	bqmassey	is it a game?
2007-12-25T13:51:00.000Z	bqmassey		it's Straw RSS reader
2007-12-25T13:52:00.000Z	Benalex	bqmassey	why do you think you should check req for a RSS reader?
2007-12-25T13:53:00.000Z	bqmassey	Benalex	 i'm an idiot on linux and im trying to build and install something.. i just dont know if the minimum requirements are filled
2007-12-25T13:53:00.000Z	Benalex	bqmassey	ahaa you mean dependencies!!
2007-12-25T13:54:00.000Z	bqmassey	Benalex	 it literally says "Minimum Requirements"
2007-12-25T13:56:00.000Z	Benalex	bqmassey	instead of digging for this consider using Akregator or Lifera Feed Reader
