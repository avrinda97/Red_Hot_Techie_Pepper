2007-06-29T09:28:00.000Z	ShadowApex		Umm.. so my sound card is located on the usb bus, rather than the pci bus.. and thus will not work correctly in Ubuntu... any insight?
2007-06-29T09:29:00.000Z	ShadowApex		You know what would help me convert
2007-06-29T09:29:00.000Z	ShadowApex		getting my sound to work
2007-06-29T09:29:00.000Z	ShadowApex		lol
2007-06-29T09:30:00.000Z	geekkit	ShadowApex	what is wrong with your sound support? im surprised that Ubuntu doesnt see it.
2007-06-29T09:32:00.000Z	ShadowApex	geekkit	Won't work in most applications (like Firefox). Some will play, like Amarok, but I am unable to raise or lower the volume.
2007-06-29T09:33:00.000Z	geekkit	ShadowApex	sounds like a codec problem more than anything
2007-06-29T09:34:00.000Z	ShadowApex	geekkit	Well, my login sounds and system sounds won't play. I know my sound card is on the USB bus and I've tried changing everything in the sound settings to USB but it still will not work.
2007-06-29T09:35:00.000Z	geekkit	ShadowApex	oh...what system are you running? (i.e., hardware?)
2007-06-29T09:36:00.000Z	ShadowApex	geekkit	I have an ASUS M2N-Plus SLI motherboard with onboard sound. Whenever I open up the device manager, it crashes
2007-06-29T09:37:00.000Z	ShadowApex	geekkit	When I run lsusb... I think this is my sound: Bus 001 Device 005: ID 0d8c:0201 C-Media Electronics, Inc.
2007-06-29T09:37:00.000Z	geekkit	ShadowApex	sorry ... i dont know why .... how old is your asus M/B?
2007-06-29T09:37:00.000Z	ShadowApex	geekkit	brand new
2007-06-29T09:37:00.000Z	ShadowApex	geekkit	"Vista ready" even
2007-06-29T09:38:00.000Z	geekkit	ShadowApex	hah, yeah right... and it runs on Vista?
2007-06-29T09:38:00.000Z	ShadowApex	geekkit	more or less. It works fine but I have had some problems with the sound when plugging in other usb devices
2007-06-29T09:39:00.000Z	geekkit	ShadowApex	hmmm....sorry guy... not sure. :/
2007-06-29T09:39:00.000Z	ShadowApex	geekkit	*cries*
