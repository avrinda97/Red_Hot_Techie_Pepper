2009-09-21T06:45:00.000Z	nyRednek		any clue on when amsynth is going to be brought to speed?
2009-09-21T06:47:00.000Z	nyRednek		i've found that sometimes, with a heavy dose of audio apps, 10gb just isn't enough, but i've never taken up 20gb
2009-09-21T06:48:00.000Z	nyRednek		while we're asking about programs, does anyone know of a relatively easy video editor?
2009-09-21T06:49:00.000Z	nyRednek		i'm pushing 5gb now

2009-09-21T06:49:00.000Z	nyRednek	comicinker	ok, i tried to do some stuff with kino, but i like to put audio on still frames that transition
2009-09-21T06:50:00.000Z	nyRednek	comicinker	i'm NOT a pro with video
2009-09-21T06:50:00.000Z	nyRednek	comicinker	but i'll try that
2009-09-21T06:50:00.000Z	comicinker	nyRednek	DVD slideshows? tried devede?
2009-09-21T06:51:00.000Z	nyRednek	comicinker	i'm slowly working into doing some stuff that is going to involve some more advanced processing
2009-09-21T06:51:00.000Z	nyRednek	comicinker	putting different video sources in boxes within the final video
2009-09-21T06:51:00.000Z	nyRednek	comicinker	will that do it?
2009-09-21T06:52:00.000Z	comicinker	nyRednek	just try them all out. for advanced video editing, use jashaka or blender
2009-09-21T06:53:00.000Z	nyRednek	comicinker	i thought blender was more solid modeling?
2009-09-21T06:53:00.000Z	nyRednek	comicinker	a good tutorial for blender?(don't say rtfm)
2009-09-21T06:54:00.000Z	comicinker	nyRednek	rtfm. google? blender.org?
2009-09-21T06:55:00.000Z	comicinker	nyRednek	the best source is often the original home page. gimp is a good example
