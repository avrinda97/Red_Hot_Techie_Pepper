2005-02-26T13:06:00.000Z	DagaZ		I have installed apache with php with the help of the unofficial guide.. but when I try to open the info.php firefox wants to open it with gedit.. any clues anyone??
2005-02-26T13:06:00.000Z	krism	DagaZ	: sounds like PHP is not installed on the apache server
2005-02-26T13:07:00.000Z	DagaZ	krism	but it is.. at least it looks like it.. I have a php.ini in /etc/php4/apache2/
2005-02-26T13:08:00.000Z	krism	DagaZ	: is it listed in /etc/apache2/mods-enabled (or similar)
2005-02-26T13:09:00.000Z	DagaZ	krism	I will check..
2005-02-26T13:10:00.000Z	DagaZ	krism	cgid.conf  cgid.load  cgi.load  userdir.conf  userdir.load are the only ones it mods-enabled
2005-02-26T13:10:00.000Z	DagaZ	krism	isn't this supposed to be done automatically?
2005-02-26T13:11:00.000Z	krism	DagaZ	: not automatically, anyway.
2005-02-26T13:11:00.000Z	krism	DagaZ	: do you see it in /etc/apache2/mods-available ?
2005-02-26T13:12:00.000Z	DagaZ	krism	nope.. crap.. I got it to work before I reinstalled.. without doing anything special
2005-02-26T13:12:00.000Z	krism	DagaZ	: hmm, maybe im wrong. but it's not on my home server, either.
2005-02-26T13:13:00.000Z	krism	DagaZ	: maybe you need to install libapache2-mod-php4?
2005-02-26T13:13:00.000Z	krism	DagaZ	: yeah, doing that on my home system got php4 for me
2005-02-26T13:15:00.000Z	krism	DagaZ	:
2005-02-26T13:15:00.000Z	krism	DagaZ	you need to 'apt-get install libapache2-mod-php4' and then '/etc/init.d/apache2 restart'
2005-02-26T13:16:00.000Z	krism	DagaZ	: once you install libapache2-mod-php4, you'll see the php entries in /etc/apache2/mods-enabled
2005-02-26T13:17:00.000Z	DagaZ	krism	ok.. will try that.. tried to restart but it didn't do the trick..
2005-02-26T13:20:00.000Z	DagaZ	krism	got it working.. ubuntu spirit glows!!
