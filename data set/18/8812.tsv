2007-07-04T09:56:00.000Z	Dark		hello. i wanted to do a benchmark test on my ubuntu, what can i use?
2007-07-04T09:56:00.000Z	dystopianray	Dark	what do you want to benchmark?
2007-07-04T09:57:00.000Z	dystopianray	Dark	glxgears?
2007-07-04T09:57:00.000Z	dystopianray	Dark	you already have it, just run it
2007-07-04T09:57:00.000Z	dystopianray	Dark	yes, that'll do
2007-07-04T09:58:00.000Z	Dark	dystopianray	what i want to do is a compare between linux and win
2007-07-04T09:58:00.000Z	dystopianray	Dark	what do you want to compare exactly?
2007-07-04T09:59:00.000Z	dystopianray	Dark	which games?
2007-07-04T09:59:00.000Z	dystopianray	Dark	why use a synthetic benchmark? benchmark the actual apps you want to run
2007-07-04T10:00:00.000Z	dystopianray	Dark	wow and wc3 run in wine and quake3 has a native client
2007-07-04T10:00:00.000Z	Dark	dystopianray	do you think an average of 56 fps in glxgears is good enough for compiz?
2007-07-04T10:01:00.000Z	dystopianray	Dark	not at all
2007-07-04T10:02:00.000Z	dystopianray	Dark	well glxgears doesn't really tell you much, what video card do you have?
2007-07-04T10:02:00.000Z	Dark	dystopianray	geforce fx 5500
2007-07-04T10:04:00.000Z	dystopianray	Dark	should be fine, best way to know is to try it out
2007-07-04T10:04:00.000Z	Dark	dystopianray	any links for an easy install?
2007-07-04T10:04:00.000Z	dystopianray	Dark	no, sorry
2007-10-21T12:50:00.000Z	dystopianray	Dark	what is your project?
