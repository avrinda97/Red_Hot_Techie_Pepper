2006-09-19T11:24:00.000Z	tgelter		hey everyone, anyone have experience converting avi movies to a compatible mpeg4 format that works with the ipod video?
2006-09-19T11:26:00.000Z	cafuego	tgelter	Yup, you need to rebuild ffmpeg and it'll be right.
2006-09-19T11:26:00.000Z	tgelter	cafuego	do you know how to do it using mencoder?
2006-09-19T11:27:00.000Z	cafuego	tgelter	No idea... I have a little script here that I use (You cna use the ffmpeg I built, if you want to)
2006-09-19T11:27:00.000Z	tgelter		is it built for dapper?
2006-09-19T11:27:00.000Z	cafuego	tgelter	http://ubuntu.cafuego.net/pool/dapper-cafuego/media/ffmpeg_0.cvs20050918-5ubuntu1+risky_i386.deb
2006-09-19T11:27:00.000Z	cafuego	tgelter	yup
2006-09-19T11:27:00.000Z	cafuego		cd .bin
2006-09-19T11:28:00.000Z	tgelter	cafuego	why the "risky" tag? =)
2006-09-19T11:28:00.000Z	cafuego	tgelter	That's the ffmpeg calls h.264 support.
2006-09-19T11:28:00.000Z	cafuego		s/the/what/
2006-09-19T11:29:00.000Z	tgelter	cafuego	thanks for the help!
2006-09-19T11:29:00.000Z	cafuego	tgelter	Use in combo with http://www.cafuego.net/stuff/vidpod.sh
2006-09-19T11:29:00.000Z	cafuego	tgelter	Run that as "vidpod.sh FILENAME wide" or "vidposd.sh FILENAME"
2006-09-19T11:30:00.000Z	cafuego	tgelter	And it'll spit out a .mp4 file for you.
2006-09-19T11:30:00.000Z	tgelter	cafuego	dpkg informs me that there is an older version of ffmpeg in the repos...should I use it, or the one you built?
2006-09-19T11:31:00.000Z	cafuego	tgelter	use the one I built, the one in the repos doesn't have support for H264
2006-09-19T11:32:00.000Z	tgelter	cafuego	thanks again for the help
