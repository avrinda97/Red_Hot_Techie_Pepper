2007-11-28T10:36:00.000Z	virtuososteve		hey
2007-11-28T10:36:00.000Z	virtuososteve		is MEPIS faster than ubuntu?
2007-11-28T10:36:00.000Z	bruenig	virtuososteve	I hear that they have some lightweight version that is very fast
2007-11-28T10:37:00.000Z	bruenig	virtuososteve	suse would be about the same
2007-11-28T10:37:00.000Z	bruenig	virtuososteve	pretty much
2007-11-28T10:39:00.000Z	bruenig	virtuososteve	distros serve three main purposes, package management, configuration schemes, and init
2007-11-28T10:40:00.000Z	bruenig	virtuososteve	outside of those three, the only real significant difference is release cycle which to me would fall under package management but maybe not
2007-11-28T10:40:00.000Z	bruenig	virtuososteve	gnome is gnome is gnome
2007-11-28T10:41:00.000Z	bruenig	virtuososteve	they are all the same
2007-11-28T10:42:00.000Z	bruenig	virtuososteve	like I said, package management, configuration, and init, those are how distros really differ
2007-11-28T10:42:00.000Z	bruenig	virtuososteve	a multimedia package is the same on ubuntu as it is on any other distro
2007-11-28T10:42:00.000Z	bruenig	virtuososteve	how the OS boots
2007-11-28T10:42:00.000Z	bruenig	virtuososteve	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Init
2007-11-28T10:44:00.000Z	bruenig	virtuososteve	sed -e 's/splash//g' 's/quiet//g' -i /boot/grub/menu.lst
2007-11-28T10:44:00.000Z	bruenig	virtuososteve	sed -e 's/splash//g' -e 's/quiet//g' -i /boot/grub/menu.lst
2007-11-28T10:46:00.000Z	bruenig	virtuososteve	just copy and paste that second thing I gave you all at once
2007-11-28T10:48:00.000Z	bruenig	virtuososteve	what?
2007-11-28T10:49:00.000Z	bruenig	virtuososteve	ok the internet is not just the www (see irc). Call those browsers.
