2008-02-22T19:52:00.000Z	ForzaPalermo	beeblebro	the site i looked at seems to be ssh for windows to windows
2008-02-22T19:35:00.000Z	beeblebro	ForzaPalermo	there's a tool coming with putty that works as sshd and in which you can set up public/private keys. Make it run on startup and you are set.
2008-02-22T19:36:00.000Z	ForzaPalermo	beeblebro	ive followed various how to's and i cant seem to get it to work
2008-02-22T19:38:00.000Z	beeblebro	ForzaPalermo	What doesn't work?
2008-02-22T19:39:00.000Z	beeblebro	ForzaPalermo	Have you used pageant and puttygen?
2008-02-22T19:39:00.000Z	ForzaPalermo	beeblebro	i remember puttygen, not pageant
2008-02-22T19:41:00.000Z	beeblebro	ForzaPalermo	pageant works as the sshd daemon that accepts connections based on keys. It must be running to get a solution like that working. puttygen by itself only generates the keys. putty doens' run as a daemon on windows per default.
2008-02-22T19:41:00.000Z	beeblebro	ForzaPalermo	my solution recently though  have been to run cygwin and sshd from there. Havent' tried vnc though.
2008-02-22T19:41:00.000Z	ForzaPalermo	beeblebro	do you have a how to or smoething to guide me in this process, like i said i would like to start from scrathc
2008-02-22T19:46:00.000Z	beeblebro	ForzaPalermo	I followed Eric J Heels howto on ssh, vnc and windows
2008-02-22T19:47:00.000Z	ForzaPalermo	beeblebro	where can i find this how to
2008-02-22T19:48:00.000Z	beeblebro	ForzaPalermo	google for the terms Erik J Heel ssh vnc windows
2008-02-22T19:49:00.000Z	ForzaPalermo	beeblebro	found it thanks
2008-02-22T19:54:00.000Z	beeblebro	ForzaPalermo	if you get vnc setup with sshd in windows, it's up and running. connecting from windows or linux should be the same.
2008-02-22T19:56:00.000Z	beeblebro	ForzaPalermo	I completely misunderstood you then. I thought you asked how to set it up on a windows machine.
2008-02-22T19:57:00.000Z	ForzaPalermo	beeblebro	no sorry :(
2008-02-22T20:00:00.000Z	beeblebro	ForzaPalermo	can bitvise tunnelier help you?
2008-02-22T20:01:00.000Z	ForzaPalermo	beeblebro	never heard of it
