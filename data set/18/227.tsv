2012-05-31T00:01:00.000Z	DuxB		Hi, can anyone give me any ideas as to why my bios is reporting that I've overclocked my cpu from 2.67 to 3.20 but ubuntu is reporting that my upper limit is 2.67 still?
2012-05-31T00:01:00.000Z	Pricey	DuxB	overclocked in the bios settings?
2012-05-31T00:01:00.000Z	DuxB	Pricey	yes
2012-05-31T00:01:00.000Z	Pricey	DuxB	Have you gone back to check the settings held?
2012-05-31T00:01:00.000Z	DuxB	Pricey	several times
2012-05-31T00:02:00.000Z	Pricey	DuxB	What is reporting it?
2012-05-31T00:03:00.000Z	DuxB	Pricey	cpufreq-info, /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_available_frequencies
2012-05-31T00:03:00.000Z	DuxB	Pricey	and /proc/cpuinfo
2012-05-31T00:04:00.000Z	DuxB	Pricey	and system-monitor
2012-05-31T00:05:00.000Z	Pricey	DuxB	I give up.
2012-05-31T00:06:00.000Z	DuxB	Pricey	well, thanks for at least responding
2012-05-31T00:06:00.000Z	DuxB	Pricey	it's more than I've gotten other places
2012-05-31T00:06:00.000Z	Pricey	DuxB	Meh... annoyingly I'm not even on my ubuntu laptop atm
2012-05-31T00:07:00.000Z	Pricey	DuxB	I assume you're not dual booting?
2012-05-31T00:07:00.000Z	DuxB	Pricey	I am, but I rarely if ever use windows
2012-05-31T00:08:00.000Z	Pricey	DuxB	This is a crappy idea... but boot into windows and see what that says?
2012-05-31T00:08:00.000Z	DuxB	Pricey	worth trying
2012-05-31T00:08:00.000Z	Pricey	DuxB	If that has the overclocked values, we can be pretty sure hardware is fine, ubuntu needs kicking
