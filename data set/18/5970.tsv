2008-10-08T09:25:00.000Z	Geoffrey2		one more time, can anyone help me with a wireless problem?
2008-10-08T09:26:00.000Z	frybye	Geoffrey2	just post the question itself - include details - what wireless card/chip - what fault report etc...
2008-10-08T09:27:00.000Z	frybye	Geoffrey2	that is not the way it is generally done here imho...
2008-10-08T09:30:00.000Z	frybye	Geoffrey2	also - have you at least tried re-starting the router... power off - wait a bit - poweron and retry...?
2008-10-08T09:31:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	frybye	yes, I rebooted the router
2008-10-08T09:33:00.000Z	frybye	Geoffrey2	had you installed a custom wifi driver yourself - which perhaps needs to be re-istalled after every kernal update...?
2008-10-08T09:36:00.000Z	frybye	Geoffrey2	I admit my suggestion now is not a typical -linux-way- of solving such a question - but do you happen to have an image you made before the above change..?
2008-10-08T09:37:00.000Z	frybye	Geoffrey2	is this on a laptop with an indicator light for when the wifi signal is being detected??? if so - is it there or...?
2008-10-08T09:42:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	frybye	the light is on
2008-10-08T09:42:00.000Z	frybye	Geoffrey2	sorry pal i am outa ideas.. dont have the knowledge needed to go deeper into this...
2008-10-08T09:43:00.000Z	frybye	Geoffrey2	I have had the problem with an eeepc using a self-installed wifi driver that after a kernal update had to be re-installed.. but... if this has any relevance to your situation i dont know...
2008-10-08T09:45:00.000Z	frybye	Geoffrey2	unfortunatly it can sometimes take a couple of days on here (at best at different times-of-the-day to reach different public...) before one lands somebody who really kn ow this or that particual area...
2008-10-08T09:45:00.000Z	Geoffrey2	frybye	as I recall, my wireless is supported out of the box starting with Heron
2008-10-08T09:45:00.000Z	frybye	Geoffrey2	then the above would nto be the issue..hmmm
2008-10-08T09:46:00.000Z	frybye	Geoffrey2	and you dont have a guru locally that you can lean on???
2008-10-08T09:47:00.000Z	frybye	Geoffrey2	my trick (as a brit living in berlin-) was to go on the ubuntu-berlin mailing list and offer a knowledge-swap - engl. conversation <> linux help .. worked for a while ...
2008-10-08T09:50:00.000Z	frybye	Geoffrey2	there must be a way of re-installing/re-config the driver for  it - dont ask me how though...
2008-10-08T09:51:00.000Z	frybye	Geoffrey2	- early in the days"" is relative.. I will be off to work soon...
