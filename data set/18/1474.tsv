2011-04-28T14:11:00.000Z	Incarus6	Macer	E17 / DR17 is great too
2011-04-28T14:11:00.000Z	Macer	Incarus6	i haven't used enlightenment in a LONG time.. but it was ok.. i didn't like its dock too much and it took too long to tweak.. plus isn't it gtk ? :)
2011-04-28T14:12:00.000Z	Incarus6	Macer	correct. I dont like e16 that much, but E17 is much better ;)
