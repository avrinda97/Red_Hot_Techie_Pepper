2008-10-15T00:11:00.000Z	ejer	scientes	if you did not back them up you can try dd_rescue
2008-10-15T00:11:00.000Z	scientes	ejer	is that potentionally destructive?
2008-10-15T00:12:00.000Z	ejer	scientes	not if you do it right, ie make an image of the drive and do stuff on that
2008-10-15T00:12:00.000Z	ejer	scientes	but what you are doing is recovery from a destructive problem...
2008-10-15T00:12:00.000Z	scientes	ejer	there is no dd_rescue
2008-10-15T00:12:00.000Z	ejer	scientes	you can install gddrescue, but you better read about it first
2008-10-15T00:13:00.000Z	ejer	scientes	check http://blog.edseek.com/archives/2004/02/25/ext3-filesystem-bad-superblock-recovery/ also
2008-10-15T00:15:00.000Z	ejer	scientes	if you can, just reformat, rescuing is many many hours of work
