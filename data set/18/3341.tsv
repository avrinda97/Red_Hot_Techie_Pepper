2009-12-08T23:24:00.000Z	Hiram	Younder	well, it does go into runlevel 5, if that's what you mean.

2009-12-08T23:25:00.000Z	Younder	Hiram	That's not standard for ubuntu, check again (from a console type runlevel)
2009-12-08T23:26:00.000Z	Younder	Hiram	not that it matters what runlevel it is. Upstart set's up the gdm
2009-12-08T23:26:00.000Z	Younder	Hiram	see /etc/init/gdm.conf
2009-12-08T23:28:00.000Z	Younder	Hiram	to boot to text mode, at grup menu type e and on the command line add text
2009-12-08T23:28:00.000Z	Younder	Hiram	that is 'text'
2009-12-08T23:29:00.000Z	Hiram		that's another problem i've been having today. the networking sometimes just quits.
2009-12-08T23:38:00.000Z	Hiram		this morning i updated some 20 packages. everything worked fine before that, now i can't enable the desktop effects any more, like my video drivers just went kablooie.
2009-12-08T23:45:00.000Z	Hiram		can anyone help me with desktop effects problems? they worked until i updated this morning. After i did that, I can't enable them.
2009-12-08T23:49:00.000Z	Younder	Hiram	There is a seperate group #upstart which deals with the upstart manager, they helped me perhaps they can help you.
