2005-03-03T07:28:00.000Z	FR500		what is Hoary Array 4?
2005-03-03T07:28:00.000Z	apokryphos	FR500	The fourth Array of Hoary.
2005-03-03T07:30:00.000Z	apokryphos	FR500	Pretty much. I think of it as the beta stages.
2005-03-03T07:39:00.000Z	apokryphos	FR500	Not that long. Depends on your Internet speed, really.
2005-03-03T07:40:00.000Z	apokryphos	FR500	What's the download limit on that?
2005-09-09T16:54:00.000Z	apokryphos	FR500	aloha!
2005-09-09T16:55:00.000Z	apokryphos	FR500	I thought they were the same thing :/
2005-09-09T16:56:00.000Z	FR500	apokryphos	ok!
2005-09-09T16:57:00.000Z	FR500	apokryphos	i thought usplash was more like the gentoo live cd thing, with that gorgeous splash boot, splashy can't have animations and things alike yet afail
2005-09-09T16:58:00.000Z	apokryphos	FR500	https://wiki.ubuntu.com//USplash
2005-09-09T05:07:00.000Z	FR500	apokryphos	do you think is installing the live dvd bootsplash too hard?
2005-09-09T05:07:00.000Z	apokryphos	FR500	eh?
2005-09-09T05:08:00.000Z	FR500	apokryphos	splashy is nowhere as good eye candy as most live cd's bootsplashes
2005-09-09T05:08:00.000Z	apokryphos	FR500	like which ones?
2005-09-09T05:09:00.000Z	FR500	apokryphos	for instance the gentoo one, also there is fc3 boot, it has a hideous theme but the whole idea is pretty good
2005-09-09T05:10:00.000Z	apokryphos	FR500	the gentoo one is..erm, colourful text
2005-09-09T05:11:00.000Z	FR500	apokryphos	well yeah i guess it doesnt even use fb, but you don't see the text normally :D
