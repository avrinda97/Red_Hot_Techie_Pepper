2007-01-13T16:24:00.000Z	N6REJ		where is apache2 live by default?
2007-01-13T16:25:00.000Z	bakert	N6REJ	config file or html files?
2007-01-13T16:25:00.000Z	bakert	N6REJ	or logs?
2007-01-13T16:25:00.000Z	bakert	N6REJ	/var/www is the web root
2007-01-13T16:26:00.000Z	bakert	N6REJ	config is /etc/apache2/sites-available/default (for the default site)
2007-01-13T16:27:00.000Z	N6REJ	bakert	well, whats happening is type "http://servername" on my xp machine and it goes to the index.  Then I have to click on the apache link to get apache default page
2007-01-13T16:27:00.000Z	N6REJ	bakert	I want to add phppgadmin to that page somehow
2007-01-13T16:29:00.000Z	bakert	N6REJ	i don't know what phpgadmin is.  but assuming you have some PHP files that make up the application you just need to put them in a directory under /var/www
2007-01-13T16:29:00.000Z	bakert	N6REJ	say you call the directory "admin".  then you can access the application at http://servername/admin/
2007-01-13T16:30:00.000Z	N6REJ	bakert	phppgadmin is the postgresQL web administration program.  I got it linked by now it says that php isn't designed to work with postgress and that I need to recompile.  Can I just add the postgres handler from synaptic?
2007-01-13T16:31:00.000Z	bakert	N6REJ	not sure.  but definitely worth trying.  is it php complaining?  if so, you might just be able to uncomment one of the lines in /etc/php.ini -- but yes install the postgres-php package (whatever it is calleD)
2007-01-13T16:32:00.000Z	bakert	N6REJ	hmm doesn't sound that good does it?  still you may find it changes it's tune if you install the right package.
2007-01-13T16:32:00.000Z	bakert	N6REJ	failing that you'll have to build php from source to get postgres support.  i can't believe that would be necessary though.
2007-01-13T16:34:00.000Z	bakert	N6REJ	did you install the php5-pgsql package and the pgppgadmin pacdkage?  i would go with those.  and yes php 5 so you can use that postgres package
2007-01-13T16:42:00.000Z	N6REJ	bakert	I'll look for the php5-pg file.  i don't know if I picked that one or not.
2007-01-13T16:44:00.000Z	bakert	N6REJ	it's called "php5-pgsql" on dapper at least
2007-01-13T16:52:00.000Z	N6REJ	bakert	got it.. .we're configuring pg now :D  thanks!
2007-01-13T16:52:00.000Z	bakert	N6REJ	glad to hear it
