2006-01-10T10:45:00.000Z	Madeye		guys, what is ubuntu-desktop package ?
2006-01-10T10:47:00.000Z	ccooke	Madeye	It's a virtual package ( it has only dependencies, no files) which depends on everything necessary for a standard ubuntu desktop system
2006-01-10T10:47:00.000Z	ccooke	Madeye	sounds about right.
2006-01-10T10:48:00.000Z	Madeye	ccooke	but i already have most of packages
2006-01-10T10:48:00.000Z	Madeye	ccooke	 I have all of the packages, so why it requesting them again
2006-01-10T10:48:00.000Z	ccooke	Madeye	apt thinks you don't, though. There could be many reasons why
2006-01-10T10:49:00.000Z	ccooke	Madeye	is this a new install?
2006-01-10T10:49:00.000Z	Madeye	ccooke	ccooke  no it's not new install
2006-01-10T10:49:00.000Z	ccooke	Madeye	what version of ubuntu?
2006-01-10T10:49:00.000Z	Madeye	ccooke	breezy
2006-01-10T10:50:00.000Z	Madeye	ccooke	2.6.12-10-686
2006-01-10T10:50:00.000Z	Madeye	ccooke	 and it's a laptop if it does matter .
2006-01-10T10:51:00.000Z	ccooke	Madeye	so, why are you doing an apt-get install ubuntu-desktop?
2006-01-10T10:52:00.000Z	ccooke	Madeye	If you already have a working install, you wouldn't normally need to.
2006-01-10T10:52:00.000Z	Madeye	ccooke	one of the packages required it to be installed
2006-01-10T10:52:00.000Z	ccooke	Madeye	apt takes care of dependencies for you, you don't need to do it manually
2006-01-10T10:53:00.000Z	ccooke	Madeye	so, what were you trying to install? why can't you just install that package using apt?
2006-01-10T10:54:00.000Z	Madeye	ccooke	hmm ok I'll cancel the download
