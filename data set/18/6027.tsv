2008-07-16T13:47:00.000Z	kelvin911		but just not some
2008-07-16T13:47:00.000Z	gaelfx		anyone go the skinny on the latest patch? is it good, or problematic?
2008-07-16T13:52:00.000Z	kelvin911		4th season links are not down but apparently i needed to repair it, double click on the winrar file that is corrupted, go to tools and Repair Archive. Once it's repaired a new rar file will appear ie fixed.Friends_S04_E03.part2
2008-07-16T13:52:00.000Z	kelvin911		And the uploader just mentioned that we would have to do this for season 4-7 =(
2008-07-16T13:52:00.000Z	kelvin911		can someone tell me how to fix rar files??
2008-07-16T13:53:00.000Z	gaelfx	kelvin911	have you considered using Wine so you can run Winrar?
