2005-09-03T05:40:00.000Z	zxc3		anyone know what to put in the Gateway Address in Network Settings?
2005-09-03T05:40:00.000Z	cafuego	zxc3	Your router IP
2005-09-03T05:41:00.000Z	cafuego	zxc3	Then you have dhcp, tell it to use dhcp.
2005-09-03T05:43:00.000Z	cafuego	zxc3	it'll make things a bit easier if you have NO experience whatsoever, yes.
2005-09-03T05:43:00.000Z	cafuego	zxc3	Easiest would be to remove the HD and plonk it in the other machine.
2005-09-03T05:44:00.000Z	zxc3	cafuego	it's a laptop
2005-09-03T05:44:00.000Z	cafuego	zxc3	ouch.
2005-09-03T05:44:00.000Z	cafuego	zxc3	You need a crossover cable then.
2005-09-03T05:45:00.000Z	cafuego	zxc3	either a switch/hub and two normal cables, or a single crossover cable.
2005-09-03T05:45:00.000Z	zxc3	cafuego	I think I have a crossover cable
2005-09-03T05:46:00.000Z	cafuego	zxc3	what OS do the machines run. Both Linux?
2005-09-03T05:46:00.000Z	cafuego	zxc3	That's fine.
2005-09-03T05:47:00.000Z	cafuego	zxc3	On the mac, go to the network CP, and enable network sharing for the built-in ethenet connection.
2005-09-03T05:47:00.000Z	cafuego	zxc3	When that's done, plug the crossover cable into both the pc and the mac.
2005-09-03T05:50:00.000Z	cafuego	zxc3	No, just ethernet
2005-09-03T05:51:00.000Z	zxc3	cafuego	I can't see any specific thing saying turning it on...but I think it is...it just has stuff to configure in the TCP/IP menu
2005-09-03T05:52:00.000Z	cafuego	zxc3	When you enable sharing, it should automatically configure it.
2005-09-03T05:56:00.000Z	zxc3	cafuego	filesharing is enabled and I've plugged the cable in (does it need to be round a special way?)
