2006-05-03T07:37:00.000Z	muraii__	{alejandro}	Okay, so, another question: do you see a distinguishable difference between Blender 2.37 (the one in the Ubuntu repository) and 2.41?
2006-05-03T07:37:00.000Z	muraii__		: knows this isn't Blender 3D support, BTW.
2006-05-03T07:37:00.000Z	muraii__		Er...
2006-05-03T07:37:00.000Z	{alejandro}	muraii__	2.41 has probably got more
2006-05-03T07:38:00.000Z	{alejandro}	muraii__	I haven't used it, but may try it on my OSX box
2006-05-03T07:38:00.000Z	{alejandro}	muraii__	if you are having issues with installing 2.41 2.37 will do fine
2006-05-03T07:38:00.000Z	muraii__	{alejandro}	Yeah, I have a 10.3.9 system (haven't gone Tiger yet), but the Ubuntu machine is the one I feel better working on.
2006-05-03T07:39:00.000Z	muraii__	{alejandro}	Yeah, I figured.
