2009-06-13T03:22:00.000Z	CSSnub		So I'm trying to lockdown rbash a bit for a user's home directory and I mistakenly type "rm -rf .bash_login .bashrc .profile .bash_profile .bash_logout" in the home directory rather than the /home/user directory. If I'm trying to delete those files for that specific user but I instead did it in the home directory I deleted them for all users? I'm a bit beyond my abilities here obviously. Did...
2009-06-13T03:22:00.000Z	CSSnub		...I just break something?
2009-06-13T03:23:00.000Z	CSSnub		ty
2009-06-13T03:23:00.000Z	usser	CSSnub	whats the point of locking down bash? what are you trying to accomplish?
2009-06-13T03:29:00.000Z	usser	CSSnub	hm why would you not let him poke around, whats the harm in that? he cant modify system files, and any private data of other users etc should be protected by permissions anyhow
2009-06-13T03:29:00.000Z	usser	CSSnub	about the only thing i'd do if you dont want him to write scripts is put his home folder on a separate partition and mount it with -noexec option
2009-06-13T03:30:00.000Z	CSSnub	usser	- so the files are by default unchangeable? I'm just trying to secure my system as much as possible and I obviously know very little about security.
2009-06-13T03:31:00.000Z	usser	CSSnub	yes all files outside of his home directory are read-only for him, provided he doesnt have sudo permissions
2009-06-13T03:32:00.000Z	usser	CSSnub	-noexec option basically forbids him from writing his own scripts in his home directory and executing them
2009-06-13T03:33:00.000Z	CSSnub	usser	- ty. I'm also having a hard time logging in with sftp. Filezilla says I've connected but then gives error "Fatal: unable to initialise SFTP on server: could not connect". Is there something I need to do to install SFTP? Isn't SFTP just using SSH (which I've installed)?
2009-06-13T03:33:00.000Z	usser	CSSnub	unfortunately noexec only works per partition. you dont want to mount your / or /home partitions with noexec it'll break stuff.
2009-06-13T03:33:00.000Z	usser	CSSnub	yes sftp is part of ssh, try using putty for sftp if you're connecting from windows machine. or sftp from linux. it gives more descriptive errors
2009-06-13T03:36:00.000Z	CSSnub	usser	- Putty will let me SSH in without errors
2009-06-13T03:37:00.000Z	usser	CSSnub	filezilla is an ftp client? yea it wont work with sftp. sorry i never used filezilla
2009-06-13T03:37:00.000Z	usser	CSSnub	there's tons of gui clients for sftp as well
2009-06-13T03:39:00.000Z	usser	CSSnub	here you go http://winscp.net/eng/docs/screenshots
2009-06-13T03:40:00.000Z	CSSnub	usser	- OK Putty gives me the same error. "Fatal: unable to initialise SFTP: could not connect"
2009-06-13T03:42:00.000Z	usser	CSSnub	hm that is weird, maybe it has something to do with rbash setup that you did so far?
