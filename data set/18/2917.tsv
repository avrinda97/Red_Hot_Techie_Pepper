2010-01-24T01:01:00.000Z	FreddyHayek		Oh well. I'll just have put up with the tiny font. I'm growing very frustrated with the idiot-proofing in the flavors of linuks (I'm missing 3 characters - so my spelling is creative :)) . There are no idiots that will log into my system. (You there, snickering, STFU). Is there some way to set up a partition so that whoever or whatever writes to it any user booting in any OS, can read, write and eksecute it? I have one drive set up with two installations of U
2010-01-24T01:02:00.000Z	jrib	FreddyHayek	font size?  System -> Preferences -> Appearance -> Fonts.  As for permissions, see ubottu
2010-01-24T01:06:00.000Z	FreddyHayek	jrib	I guess that "!" nomenclature elicited the ot message. Thanks. I'll ollk at it but I've goggled permissions already and spent a lot of time reading the results. I can screw with individual files easily. What I want is to change the way the permissions default so to speak. I want any files written to a particular partition to AUTOMATICALLY have permissions for anyone to do anything with. Not to have to change them one at a time.
2010-01-24T01:06:00.000Z	jrib	FreddyHayek	do you have more than one user on your system?
2010-01-24T01:08:00.000Z	FreddyHayek	jrib	Technically, yes. I have different user names on the two seperate installations. They are both me but the machine doesn't know that.
2010-01-24T01:08:00.000Z	jrib	FreddyHayek	what filesystem is the partition in question?
2010-01-24T01:11:00.000Z	FreddyHayek	jrib	FAT (presumaly 32, Ubuntu just calls it FAT, Which, to me means FAT12, but I can't believe that). I also have one et3 data partition that seems to work the same way. I gave up on et4.
2010-01-24T01:11:00.000Z	jrib	FreddyHayek	what partition are you talking about now?  FAT doesn't store permissions so those get decided at mount time
2010-01-24T01:15:00.000Z	FreddyHayek	jrib	I'm talking about the FAT. I picked it specifically for that freason bcause I couldn't get es4 partitions to even consistently give access to the partiton let alone the files on it. If I can't get the perms to default the way I want 'em, maybe I could run some sort of script that would reset all perms on all files in a given partition, all the way down thru the subdirectories, sort of like a GLObAL command in a 4DOS batch file?
2010-01-24T01:16:00.000Z	jrib	FreddyHayek	like I said, FAT doesn't store permissions.  Just mount it with the right options
2010-01-24T01:29:00.000Z	FreddyHayek	jrib	the FAT article you referred me to SEEMS to imply that if I reformat NTFS that may accomplish what I want, i.e, , a partition that lets anyone who can mount it, regardless of what installation of Ubuntu they boot form or what account they are in, or for that matter, what OS they are using to read, write, or eksecute anything on that partition without having to reset file perms of individual files. Afore I go off and reformat, do you believe my inference
2010-01-24T01:29:00.000Z	jrib	FreddyHayek	while that's true of ntfs, it is also true of fat
2010-01-24T01:32:00.000Z	FreddyHayek	jrib	that's what I thought before. That  is why I used FAT. but it doesn't seem to be working that way. Seems, at the very least,  to be stopping anyone but the creator from modifying any file unless I reset the perms.
2010-01-24T01:33:00.000Z	jrib	FreddyHayek	fat does not have permissions.  They get set when you mount them.
2010-01-24T01:33:00.000Z	jrib	FreddyHayek	just follow ubottu's link on what options you need to pass when you mount
2010-01-24T01:36:00.000Z	FreddyHayek	jrib	thanks. What I hear you saying is that I had half the solution by formatting FAT (or I could have used NTFS) but that now I need to study mounting. If you say that is a fair summary, I'll go study mounting options and quit bthering y'all for a while. Do I take you r meaning correctly?
2010-01-24T01:36:00.000Z	jrib	FreddyHayek	right.  If you are using fstab, ubottu's link should tell you exactly what options you need.  (umask)
2010-01-24T01:37:00.000Z	FreddyHayek	jrib	TYVM. later.
