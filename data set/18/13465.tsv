2005-11-18T11:29:00.000Z	MrFarts		 where exactly can i get the ms core fonts package for ubuntu ?
2005-11-18T11:30:00.000Z	MrFarts		maddler, no go
2005-11-18T11:31:00.000Z	MrFarts		Package msttcorefonts is not available, but is referred to by another package.
2005-11-18T11:31:00.000Z	MrFarts		This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or
2005-11-18T11:31:00.000Z	MrFarts		is only available from another source
2005-11-18T11:31:00.000Z	MrFarts		i have no idea what that means
2005-11-18T11:31:00.000Z	MrFarts		what in the world does that error mean
2005-11-18T11:31:00.000Z	MrFarts		it seems that debian is still as beligerently unfriendly as ever
2005-11-18T11:32:00.000Z	MrFarts		what in the world does "referred to by another package" mean
2005-11-18T11:33:00.000Z	EdLin	MrFarts	you probably need the universe repository too
2005-11-18T11:36:00.000Z	EdLin	MrFarts	if you still have a Windows partition, you can copy Windows's *.ttf fonts to a ~/.fonts directory and they will Just Work (and look better than the old corefonts)
2005-11-18T11:37:00.000Z	MrFarts	EdLin	what do you mean "still have"
2005-11-18T11:37:00.000Z	EdLin	MrFarts	OK, then never mind.
2005-11-18T11:39:00.000Z	EdLin	MrFarts	though occasionally the -security universe repository gets security fixes so you might want to leave that.
2005-11-18T11:55:00.000Z	EdLin	MrFarts	"apt-cache show build-essential" or running apt-get will reveal that it's a meta package that downloads much more than just the compiler.
2005-11-18T12:02:00.000Z	MrFarts	EdLin	don't you have broadband ?
2005-11-18T12:02:00.000Z	EdLin	MrFarts	no broadband
2005-11-18T12:02:00.000Z	MrFarts	EdLin	poor deprived child
