2009-02-14T08:04:00.000Z	lmao	WebcamWonder	how do you do that
2009-02-14T08:04:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	lmao	Not possible without PA. Skype uses Alsa by default. And you need your soundcard to support hardware mixing, or dmix for software mixing
2009-02-14T08:04:00.000Z	lmao	WebcamWonder	what is PA?
2009-02-14T08:05:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	lmao	Yeah, pulseaudio. There is a wiki out there that instructs on how to properly configure skype for PA, if you use it that is
2009-02-14T08:06:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	lmao	What version of Ubuntu are you on?
2009-02-14T08:06:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	lmao	And, do you use PA? Or not?
2009-02-14T08:07:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	lmao	Then you need dmix to enable software mixing (which I have no clue with). I would recommend to ask more people here, and google around
2009-02-14T08:08:00.000Z	lmao	WebcamWonder	no i dont use it currently
2009-02-14T08:10:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	lmao	Oh, sorry. Missed your reply in the comments, hold up
2009-02-14T08:11:00.000Z	lmao	WebcamWonder	ok
2009-02-14T08:11:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	lmao	I can't take guarentee for this, but here is what a search turned up, http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=32063
2009-02-14T08:31:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	lmao	Did you save a backup of those config files? Or, did you use gedit to edit the files?
2009-02-14T08:31:00.000Z	lmao	WebcamWonder	i used gedit
2009-02-14T08:31:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	lmao	gedit makes an automatic backup of all edited files. Just goto the directory you edited the file from, and you should see a file name, originalfilename~, that is your backup
2009-02-14T08:32:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	lmao	Move the original file to somehting like, filename.doesntwork, and move the backup to the real filename
2009-02-14T08:33:00.000Z	lmao	WebcamWonder	k thansk
