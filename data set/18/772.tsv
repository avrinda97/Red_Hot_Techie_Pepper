2012-01-01T02:47:00.000Z	tyler_wylie	hansg01	What kind of endpoints?
2012-01-01T02:48:00.000Z	tyler_wylie	hansg01	If you're in Ubuntu you should be able to set up a simple PPTP vpn with the NetworkManager tool, I believe there's a PPTP plugin as well so that you can create a new network in there.
2012-01-01T02:49:00.000Z	tyler_wylie	hansg01	I've got more experience with Cisco VPN but I know that I've been able to setup PPTP with NetworkManager before.

2012-01-01T02:49:00.000Z	hansg01	tyler_wylie	the gateway = pptp server?
2012-01-01T02:49:00.000Z	tyler_wylie	hansg01	I went to edit connections, VPN tab, add, then select PPTP
2012-01-01T02:50:00.000Z	tyler_wylie	hansg01	Yes, the gateway will be the endpoint of your tunnel
2012-01-01T02:50:00.000Z	hansg01	tyler_wylie	yeah done hat too
2012-01-01T02:50:00.000Z	hansg01	tyler_wylie	and what abt NT domain?
2012-01-01T02:51:00.000Z	tyler_wylie	hansg01	Is your PPTP end point a Windows box?
2012-01-01T02:52:00.000Z	tyler_wylie	hansg01	Unfortunately I'm not familiar with how their VPN setups work
2012-01-01T02:53:00.000Z	tyler_wylie	hansg01	Under advanced you can specify which authentication method to use as well, I use mschap here but should try to grab as much information from them on configuration details for your VPN.
2012-01-01T02:56:00.000Z	tyler_wylie	hansg01	I am working on some alcatel lucent FTTU equipment atm so don't have much spare time

2012-01-01T02:58:00.000Z	tyler_wylie	hansg01	Best of luck getting that setup
