2007-12-16T14:07:00.000Z	lardarse		onto my desktop
2007-12-16T14:08:00.000Z	lardarse		chmod: cannot access `*.cpp': No such file or directory
2007-12-16T14:08:00.000Z	lardarse		no.. the files ar a couple of levels down
2007-12-16T14:08:00.000Z	lardarse		in multiple folders
2007-12-16T14:09:00.000Z	lardarse		and i just discovered that i cant blindly 644 everything, because the folders stop feing folders
2007-12-16T14:09:00.000Z	lardarse		being*
2007-12-16T14:10:00.000Z	lardarse		ehh...
2007-12-16T14:10:00.000Z	lardarse		i would rather not type in a command 17 times...
2007-12-16T14:10:00.000Z	lardarse		or more
2007-12-16T14:11:00.000Z	lardarse		yeah... but then i still ahve to get into each folder in turn
2007-12-16T14:12:00.000Z	nickrud	lardarse	that's why you would specify files ending in .cpp to chmod, the dir's would be left alone
2007-12-16T14:12:00.000Z	lardarse	nickrud	yes... i'm trying that
2007-12-16T14:13:00.000Z	nickrud	lardarse	BarryToeman suggested  chmod -R 644 *.cpp . Did you try that?
2007-12-16T14:13:00.000Z	lardarse	nickrud	i tried tht myself
2007-12-16T14:13:00.000Z	nickrud	lardarse	from inside the top dir of the files you unpacked?
2007-12-16T14:13:00.000Z	lardarse	nickrud	yes
2007-12-16T14:13:00.000Z	nickrud	lardarse	then that is very odd, -R has never failed me
2007-12-16T14:16:00.000Z	nickrud	lardarse	try chmod 622 -R *.cpp
