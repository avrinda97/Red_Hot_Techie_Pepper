2008-07-03T18:46:00.000Z	ilowe	zhaozhou	they *should* install to the right locations
2008-07-03T18:46:00.000Z	ilowe	zhaozhou	I recently switched here from gentoo.... too much fiddling... I'll go back one day but for now I get more done faster on ubuntu
2008-07-03T18:46:00.000Z	zhaozhou	ilowe	I'm aware of that. I have seen lots of packages looking in the /usr/local/include though...
2008-07-03T18:47:00.000Z	ilowe	zhaozhou	true... always good to double-check these things
2008-07-03T18:47:00.000Z	zhaozhou	ilowe	It's the fiddling that makes linux so much fun!
2008-07-03T18:47:00.000Z	ilowe	zhaozhou	don't I know it!
2008-07-03T18:47:00.000Z	ilowe	zhaozhou	except when you're trying to do some work on a coding project and you spend your time mucking about trying to config your gfx card
2008-07-03T18:48:00.000Z	zhaozhou	ilowe	Ha, true.
2008-07-03T18:49:00.000Z	ilowe	zhaozhou	I also really like the pkg management in gentoo: nice and simple. I guess it's much easier when you're doing source distros instead of binary
2008-07-03T18:50:00.000Z	zhaozhou	ilowe	It's logical and it's smart, but not optimal. It takes WAY too much memory and does CPU spikes as hell.
2008-07-03T18:50:00.000Z	zhaozhou	ilowe	But i like it aswell. Plus, it gives me the feeling my computer is 100 times faster (probably placebo, but still... ;-))
2008-07-03T18:52:00.000Z	ilowe	zhaozhou	I just got frustrated that a clean install takes hours... I'm building machines like it's going out of style and I can't afford to wait 4 hours to find out if my config is good
2008-07-03T18:54:00.000Z	zhaozhou	ilowe	I tend to run on the snapshot until i have a steady install, running X and everthing. THEN i compile everything, and leaving it over night. Takes 2 or 3 hours if only my dualcore works.
2008-07-03T18:54:00.000Z	zhaozhou	ilowe	I used a compilefarm though, took about half, since the did half the work.
2008-07-03T18:55:00.000Z	ilowe	zhaozhou	yeah... the compile farm is a good idea.
2008-07-03T18:56:00.000Z	zhaozhou	ilowe	Sure is, they sit around listening for mail or incoming HTTP-requests all day, might aswell do something useful with the CPU. ;)
2008-07-03T18:59:00.000Z	ilowe	zhaozhou	hehe... 101 reasons to love your idle boxen
