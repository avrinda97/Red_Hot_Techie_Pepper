2009-07-21T15:20:00.000Z	xcdfgkjhgcv		I keep seeing "to retrieve share list from server" when trying to browse samba shared on Jaunty. HELP!!!!!!!!!!1111
2009-07-21T15:21:00.000Z	jnewt	xcdfgkjhgcv	try with smbclient from the server, then from the client, that will help to narrow the problem, i have been through this too many times.
2009-07-21T15:22:00.000Z	jnewt	xcdfgkjhgcv	use both the anonymous connection and your username share if you have one.
2009-07-21T15:22:00.000Z	xcdfgkjhgcv	jnewt	I can mount Samba shares just fine.
2009-07-21T15:22:00.000Z	jnewt	xcdfgkjhgcv	yeah, can you browse though?
2009-07-21T15:22:00.000Z	xcdfgkjhgcv	jnewt	The problem is just with Nautilus.
2009-07-21T15:22:00.000Z	xcdfgkjhgcv	jnewt	I can not browse the workgroups.
2009-07-21T15:23:00.000Z	jnewt	xcdfgkjhgcv	i don't even know what nautilus is, but i do know how samba works, very well.
2009-07-21T15:23:00.000Z	xcdfgkjhgcv	jnewt	WTF you use Ubuntu but don't know what Nautilus is?!?!??
2009-07-21T15:24:00.000Z	jnewt	xcdfgkjhgcv	i just started with ubuntu, less than 1hr, but i use debian on all the servers, samba pdc with ldap backend and xp clients.
2009-07-21T15:24:00.000Z	jnewt	xcdfgkjhgcv	so that's wtf
2009-07-21T15:24:00.000Z	xcdfgkjhgcv	jnewt	Nautilus is like the Konqueror for Gnome.
2009-07-21T15:25:00.000Z	jnewt	xcdfgkjhgcv	Boohbah : got it, won't be much help there, but i would be glad to help with samba if it comes down to it.
2009-07-21T15:26:00.000Z	xcdfgkjhgcv	jnewt	I want to browse samba shares with my Nautilus, though.
2009-07-21T15:27:00.000Z	jnewt	xcdfgkjhgcv	can you verify that samba is working correctly through both anonymous and username / password connections from the "server" and "client". if so, someone else should help.  if not, i will help.
2009-07-21T15:29:00.000Z	xcdfgkjhgcv	jnewt	No.
2009-07-21T15:29:00.000Z	xcdfgkjhgcv	jnewt	I'm unsure how.
2009-07-21T15:30:00.000Z	jnewt	xcdfgkjhgcv	pm me, as i don't know how and i will quickly walk you through it.
