2007-08-10T11:32:00.000Z	RichardCranium		I got a reboot, control+alt+delete problem. If I use those comands my computer shuts down software wise but it won't tickle the computer to make it reboot or restart. It just hangs and I have crawl under my desk and pull the plug. Any Ideas where I should turn?
2007-08-10T11:32:00.000Z	RichardCranium		I works in recovery mode boot up though.
2007-08-10T11:33:00.000Z	bulmer	RichardCranium	what do you want? to reboot after a shutdown?
2007-08-10T11:33:00.000Z	RichardCranium	bulmer	yes shutdown works but not reboot
2007-08-10T11:34:00.000Z	bulmer	RichardCranium	have you tried as root.... shutdown -r now   command?
2007-08-10T11:34:00.000Z	RichardCranium	bulmer	yes same result, it hangs
2007-08-10T11:35:00.000Z	RichardCranium	bulmer	would the usplash screen have anything to do with it?
2007-08-10T11:36:00.000Z	bulmer	RichardCranium	when it hangs..where does it hangs..and did you look at the /var/log/messages after a reboot?
2007-08-10T11:36:00.000Z	RichardCranium	bulmer	can the usplash screen be disabled?
2007-08-10T11:38:00.000Z	RichardCranium	bulmer	the system does shutdown the computer just won't go back and reboot bios and the scsi bios etc. order of the boot sequence
2007-08-10T11:38:00.000Z	bulmer	RichardCranium	possibly..i dont am not sure how to disable it..or rather didnt notice the splashcreen option for grub
2007-08-10T11:39:00.000Z	bulmer	RichardCranium	sounsd more like the boot up process is failing? not the shutdown?
2007-08-10T11:44:00.000Z	RichardCranium	bulmer	oh well I will have to get a remote controlled wall outlet :=)
2007-08-10T11:45:00.000Z	bulmer	RichardCranium	huh? too far for you?
2007-08-10T11:46:00.000Z	bulmer	RichardCranium	getting up and stretching is good for blood circulations... :)
2007-08-10T11:46:00.000Z	RichardCranium	bulmer	I will see what happens with no splash in the menu.1st
2007-08-10T11:46:00.000Z	RichardCranium	bulmer	thanks
2007-08-10T11:46:00.000Z	RichardCranium	bulmer	ha
