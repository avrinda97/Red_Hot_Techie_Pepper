2010-04-19T07:48:00.000Z	tvaughn		I just installed ubuntu 9.10 and updated and rebooted as it asked me to... and now it wont login it just accepts the password, trys to login, then crashes back to login prompt
2010-04-19T07:49:00.000Z	tvaughn		I have one too
2010-04-19T07:51:00.000Z	David-A	tvaughn	try select session "gnome failsafe" before login, then try debug/fix problem, then remember to switch back to "gnome" when it works
2010-04-19T07:57:00.000Z	tvaughn	David-A	could grub cause this?
2010-04-19T07:59:00.000Z	David-A	tvaughn	sorry, cause what?
2010-04-19T07:59:00.000Z	tvaughn	David-A	the login issue but it worked in failsafe what do I do now
2010-04-19T08:00:00.000Z	David-A	tvaughn	grub is not involved when logging in. i would suspect old settings not compatible with new programs if login fails after upgrade (settings in dot-files in home folder)
2010-04-19T08:01:00.000Z	tvaughn	David-A	well what should I do
2010-04-19T08:03:00.000Z	David-A	tvaughn	copy all dot-files to a temporary folder (e.g. called "dot-file-backup/") and see if login works (all your themes and mails will be gone) then dot files back one at a time , logout and login, and see when it stops working, that is the offending dotfile. then copy all other dotfiles back and themes and mails should be back.
2010-04-19T08:04:00.000Z	tvaughn	David-A	there has to be a less tedius way..
2010-04-19T08:05:00.000Z	David-A	tvaughn	yes, see log files and google suspect error messages
2010-04-19T08:05:00.000Z	David-A	tvaughn	e.g. .xsession-errors
2010-04-19T08:09:00.000Z	tvaughn	David-A	I dont have a .xsession-errors
2010-04-19T08:12:00.000Z	David-A	tvaughn	there should be a .xsession-errors after you have loggen in in a graphical environment (as opposed to text mode) its a hidden file so you need ls -a or control-h in the file browser
2010-04-19T08:12:00.000Z	tvaughn	David-A	I found it but google is failing me :(
2010-04-19T08:14:00.000Z	David-A	tvaughn	what about creating a new user, e.g. "alterego" and login into that, see if that work. then old dotfiles are even more likely the cause.
2010-04-19T08:17:00.000Z	tvaughn	David-A	still fails
2010-04-19T08:19:00.000Z	David-A	tvaughn	does login into a new user "alterego" fail? not good then
