2011-05-30T11:10:00.000Z	ryoohki		anyone know about disk partitioning?
2011-05-30T11:10:00.000Z	r0fs3ck5	ryoohki	what is your question about disk partitioning?
2011-05-30T11:11:00.000Z	r0fs3ck5	ryoohki	this is not a Windows 7 help channel
2011-05-30T11:12:00.000Z	r0fs3ck5	ryoohki	but I can tell you that I have safely run multiple extended partitions.
2011-05-30T11:12:00.000Z	ryoohki	r0fs3ck5	dual boot win7 + ubuntu
2011-05-30T11:12:00.000Z	ryoohki	r0fs3ck5	win7 takes primary partitions 1-3
2011-05-30T11:13:00.000Z	ryoohki	r0fs3ck5	i think that leaves 4 to be extended and then 3 more logical partitions?
2011-05-30T11:15:00.000Z	r0fs3ck5	ryoohki	is this a practical help request?
2011-05-30T11:15:00.000Z	ryoohki	r0fs3ck5	yeah, i need more partitions for ubuntu since win7 selfishly takes up 3 primary partitions
2011-05-30T11:17:00.000Z	r0fs3ck5	ryoohki	what yagoo said.  As long as GRUB can see your Ubuntu partition, you should be fine.
2011-05-30T11:17:00.000Z	ryoohki	r0fs3ck5	i know but that's not what i am trying to do
2011-05-30T11:20:00.000Z	r0fs3ck5	ryoohki	alright, wha tis it that you are trying to do?
2011-05-30T11:20:00.000Z	ryoohki	r0fs3ck5	i said, i want to create the maximmum partitions using standard pc disk formating
2011-05-30T11:20:00.000Z	ryoohki	r0fs3ck5	is the maximum 8 or 16?
2011-05-30T11:23:00.000Z	r0fs3ck5	ryoohki	the maximum number of primary partitions is theoretically 4
2011-05-30T11:23:00.000Z	ryoohki	r0fs3ck5	that's not theory
2011-05-30T11:23:00.000Z	r0fs3ck5	ryoohki	and trolling old day to you too.
2011-05-30T11:24:00.000Z	ryoohki	r0fs3ck5	what?
