2008-01-23T13:02:00.000Z	ganesh	krubs	yeah wat you said is correct
2008-01-23T13:03:00.000Z	ganesh	krubs	thatsy i said manuall process
2008-01-23T13:03:00.000Z	ganesh	krubs	i have to edit the menu.lst file manually
2008-01-23T13:04:00.000Z	krubs	ganesh	you try that, but am still not convince you can just then boot off of that new partition
2008-01-23T13:04:00.000Z	krubs	ganesh	lets us know how it goes
2008-01-23T13:05:00.000Z	ganesh	krubs	after editting the menu.lst file manually it really boots sure
2008-01-23T13:05:00.000Z	krubs	ganesh	you already made it work? thats excellent
2008-01-23T13:05:00.000Z	ganesh	krubs	mine requirement is how to do these thing through command mode
2008-01-23T13:06:00.000Z	krubs		ganesh-> huh? what do you mean in command mode?
2008-01-23T13:06:00.000Z	ganesh	krubs	without editing menu.lst
2008-01-23T13:06:00.000Z	krubs		ganesh-> impossible, thats whats required by grub is the menu.lst
2008-01-23T13:07:00.000Z	ganesh	krubs	it means if i run the command " grub-install --root-directory=<newparttion> /dev/sda   it has to update the menu.lst
2008-01-23T13:08:00.000Z	krubs	ganesh	try and has it modified yet?
2008-01-23T13:08:00.000Z	ganesh	krubs	by this  command " grub-install --root-directory=<newparttion> /dev/sda "the stage1 is not able to read this the error im getting
2008-01-23T13:09:00.000Z	ganesh	krubs	are you getting my problem
2008-01-23T13:09:00.000Z	krubs		ganesh-> i know, because those are part of the whole shebang for booting, device.map and stage1 has to match
2008-01-23T13:10:00.000Z	krubs		ganesh-> and including System.map
2008-01-23T13:10:00.000Z	krubs	ganesh	if it was that easy to just copy files and boot..it would be nice
