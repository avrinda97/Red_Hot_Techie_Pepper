2005-12-22T12:09:00.000Z	angsty		well, back to my original question: is there any known/common problems with ubuntu freezing right after the login screen?
2005-12-22T12:10:00.000Z	angsty		the only hardware I have installed right now are my lan card, video card, dvd drive and one hdd
2005-12-22T12:10:00.000Z	angsty		I was thinking maybe it's trying to play some cute audio file and dying for lack of audio card
2005-12-22T12:10:00.000Z	angsty		but I don't know.
2005-12-22T12:11:00.000Z	_jason	angsty	doubt this is your problem but check: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuDateBug
2005-12-22T12:13:00.000Z	_jason	angsty	is the date on your computer before 1970?
2005-12-22T12:13:00.000Z	angsty	_jason	I don't think so
2005-12-22T12:13:00.000Z	_jason	angsty	type 'date'

2005-12-22T12:25:00.000Z	_jason	angsty	you probably need to install the appropriate drivers for your card now, what kind of card do you have?
2005-12-22T12:26:00.000Z	_jason	angsty	search the forums for your problem, it is commonly referred to as the "brown screen of death"
2005-12-22T12:27:00.000Z	_jason	angsty	I'm off to bed now, gl
