2008-01-08T22:41:00.000Z	shade052		i freshly installed fiesty once and had not yet installed samba. funny thing was i was still able to access windows XP file. any one know the reason?
2008-01-08T22:42:00.000Z	ikonia	shade052	the samba file system driver is part of the kernel
2008-01-08T22:42:00.000Z	ikonia	shade052	the samba client is installed by default
2008-01-08T22:43:00.000Z	shade052	ikonia	dont we need samba server?
2008-01-08T22:43:00.000Z	ikonia	shade052	no - thats for "serving" shares
2008-01-08T22:43:00.000Z	ikonia	shade052	your using a client to connect "to" a share
2008-01-08T22:43:00.000Z	shade052	ikonia	k
2008-01-08T22:45:00.000Z	shade052	ikonia	but i am sure that samba was not part of the daper drake kernel. am i wrong. because in that it was impossible to connect to windows without getting samba connected
2008-01-08T22:45:00.000Z	ikonia	shade052	it's been in the kernel for a while
2008-01-08T22:47:00.000Z	shade052	ikonia	some one told me may be it the enabled sharing was due to avahi network tools which started shipping with fiesty
2008-01-08T22:47:00.000Z	ikonia	shade052	I doubt that
2008-01-08T22:47:00.000Z	ikonia	shade052	remember, your not sharing - your mounting using the sambaclient and file system
2008-01-08T22:47:00.000Z	shade052	ikonia	yes.k
2008-01-28T15:51:00.000Z	ikonia	shade052	I'm not aware of that package are you making a genuine request
2008-01-28T15:53:00.000Z	shade052	ikonia	yup.. is a debian pkg. lot of debate going on slash dot weather it should have been included in the pkg... Is a system monitor where i girl removes clothes as the cpu usage increases
2008-02-01T20:40:00.000Z	ikonia	shade052	he doesn't need a machine name user adding
2008-02-01T20:41:00.000Z	shade052	ikonia	i had the same prob once it worked fine! with that. any other name was not loggin in
2008-02-01T20:41:00.000Z	shade052	ikonia	any other name was workin with other distros though
