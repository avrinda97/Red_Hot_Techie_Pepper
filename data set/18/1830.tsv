2010-10-26T21:10:00.000Z	tomcatjosh	licia	I believe you should give 8.10 i try: http://www.pendrivelinux.com/ubuntu-810-persistent-flash-drive-install-from-live-cd/
2010-10-26T21:11:00.000Z	tomcatjosh	licia	Just upgrade all the way up to 10.10. IMO i would just go buy a new 2GB Drive :) Good luck in any case!
