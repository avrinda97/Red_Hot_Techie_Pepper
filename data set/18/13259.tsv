2005-12-23T12:25:00.000Z	ejofee	sethk	me?
2005-12-23T12:25:00.000Z	sethk	ejofee	yes, I'm curious
2005-12-23T12:26:00.000Z	ejofee	sethk	when i use kdm, i get the expanded physical path for "~" as a prompt, while, when i use startx, i get "~" as a prompt.
2005-12-23T12:27:00.000Z	sethk	ejofee	that has to be a case of it being escaped where it shouldn't be, I would think
2005-12-23T12:27:00.000Z	ejofee	sethk	however, my problem is somehow "multilevel"... my /home folder is actually a symlink to another /home folder on another partition
2005-12-23T12:28:00.000Z	sethk	ejofee	I've run into a problem with that, actually, but it doesn't really apply here.
2005-12-24T09:19:00.000Z	sethk	ejofee	it was the default for the 2.4 kernel module tools
2005-12-24T09:20:00.000Z	ejofee	sethk	and does 2.6 have another default?
2005-12-24T09:20:00.000Z	sethk	ejofee	I think it is a different name in /etc.  I'll have to check.  I usually avoid modules.
2005-12-24T09:20:00.000Z	sethk	ejofee	man modprobe will probably tell you
2006-01-07T09:26:00.000Z	sethk	ejofee	hard to give a hard and fast answer
2006-01-07T09:26:00.000Z	sethk	ejofee	the compiler versions should be ok
2006-01-07T09:26:00.000Z	sethk	ejofee	the qt library, depends on the version and the version it replaces
2006-01-07T09:27:00.000Z	ejofee	sethk	crimsun: i am on kubuntu and i think, since it doesn't ask me to reinstall anything from kde, then everything should be ok. am i right?
2006-01-07T09:27:00.000Z	sethk	ejofee	theoretically, sure.  Still I'd probably check the versions and the kde web site, just to be cautios
2006-01-07T09:32:00.000Z	ejofee	sethk	thank you (i misspelled your nick earlier)
2006-01-07T09:32:00.000Z	sethk	ejofee	np  :)
2006-01-20T15:49:00.000Z	sethk	ejofee	I don't think so.  That division between "supplied by mozilla" and "supplied by other than mozilla" is more or less insisted upon by mozilla
