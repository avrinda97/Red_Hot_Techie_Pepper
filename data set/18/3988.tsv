2009-08-06T02:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kad_	ap-get has its own proxy sttings

2009-08-06T02:30:00.000Z	kad_	ActionParsnip	 how i can change this to default automatic?
2009-08-06T02:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	kad_	if the proxy setting is stll present for apt-get it will stil try to use it
2009-08-06T02:31:00.000Z	kad_	ActionParsnip	 not present
