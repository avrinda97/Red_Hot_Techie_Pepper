2005-08-24T13:56:00.000Z	Kira		Does someone have a recommendation for a PPPoE dialer in Ubuntu?
2005-08-24T13:57:00.000Z	ompaul	Kira	ppp oe and dialer ... emm network or dialer?
2005-08-24T13:57:00.000Z	ompaul	Kira	pppoe - system - settings - networking
2005-08-24T13:59:00.000Z	ompaul	Kira	is your connection to a router at this time?
2005-08-24T13:59:00.000Z	Kira	ompaul	no, switch
2005-08-24T14:00:00.000Z	ompaul	Kira	so just enabling the network interface should work for you
2005-08-24T14:04:00.000Z	ompaul	Kira	just enable the network card to talk tcp/ip the pppoe stuff should be on the other side of the switch and therefore not your concern (with a bit if luck())
2005-08-24T14:05:00.000Z	Kira	ompaul	that's not the case.
2005-08-24T14:06:00.000Z	Kira	ompaul	for me, each machine on my network has to log in (and yes, I get a real public IP for each machine this way).
2005-08-24T14:06:00.000Z	ompaul	Kira	:)
2005-08-24T14:07:00.000Z	ompaul	Kira	so are the addresses static or dynamic?
2005-08-24T14:08:00.000Z	Kira	ompaul	dynamic
2005-08-24T14:09:00.000Z	ompaul	Kira	so just choose dhcp and it should work for you
2005-08-24T14:09:00.000Z	ompaul	Kira	please try that and then if that does not work I will do some digging using uncle google
2005-08-24T14:14:00.000Z	Kira	ompaul	I got it working using pppoeconf. :)
2005-08-24T14:18:00.000Z	ompaul	Kira	great
2008-09-06T22:25:00.000Z	ompaul	Kira	ehh if you should have installed a server - the fastest way to get there is to install the server rather than trying to take out gnome etc
2008-09-06T22:26:00.000Z	ompaul	Kira	sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop ; sudo apt-get install rcconf      << sudo rcconf and turn off gdm for next reboot >> enjoy
