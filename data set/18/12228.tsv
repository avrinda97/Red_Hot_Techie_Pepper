2010-07-16T16:08:00.000Z	bora		I installed ubuntu 10.04 on both my tabletpc and desktop both have NVIDIA graphics cards. and I was able to install the nvidia drivers on the laptop without issues, but on my pc I get 640x480
2010-07-16T16:08:00.000Z	bora		the card only has DVI outputs and its connected to the monitor over HDMI so DVI-HDMI
2010-07-16T16:10:00.000Z	bora		Could anyone help me with that issue?
2010-07-16T16:12:00.000Z	bora		i need help fixing this  if i cant fix this in 24 hours im going to fedora =P
2010-07-16T16:12:00.000Z	ikonia	bora	dvi-hdmi conversion can often be a problem
2010-07-16T16:13:00.000Z	ikonia	bora	check (use the xorg log) what modes your monitor is advertising (is it a monitor or a TV)
2010-07-16T16:14:00.000Z	ikonia	bora	what graphics drives are you using
2010-07-16T16:14:00.000Z	ikonia	bora	ok, sounds sensible
2010-07-16T16:15:00.000Z	ikonia	bora	using the xorg log file, what modes is your monitor advertising ?
2010-07-16T16:15:00.000Z	ikonia	bora	using the screen resolution tool, what modes are available ?
2010-07-16T16:15:00.000Z	ikonia	bora	can you also verify they are using the nvidia drivers ?
2010-07-16T16:19:00.000Z	ikonia	bora	looks good
2010-07-16T16:20:00.000Z	ikonia	bora	can you confirm it's using the Nvidia drivers in the xorg conf
2010-07-16T16:23:00.000Z	ikonia	bora	interesting, I'd disable twinview (unless you are using 2 monitors)
2010-07-16T16:24:00.000Z	ikonia	bora	have you tried the nvidia-settings tool ?
2010-07-16T16:25:00.000Z	ikonia	bora	try using it to configure the card
2010-07-16T16:26:00.000Z	ikonia	bora	is the nvidia kernel module loaded ?
