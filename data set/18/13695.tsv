2006-11-14T06:17:00.000Z	ubuntun00b	ruxpin	they are better the open source?
2006-11-14T06:17:00.000Z	ruxpin	ubuntun00b	depends on what you want, but generally yes

2006-11-14T06:17:00.000Z	ruxpin	ubuntun00b	it works for ubuntu
2006-11-14T06:18:00.000Z	ruxpin	ubuntun00b	you only need to conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf

2006-11-14T06:18:00.000Z	ruxpin	ubuntun00b	shut xdm and test the setup with 'startx'
2006-11-14T06:19:00.000Z	ruxpin	ubuntun00b	you can run irssi in screen so you'll have the same session in vterm and X

2006-11-14T06:22:00.000Z	ruxpin	ubuntun00b	ubuntu pulls all drivers with xorg-server
2006-11-14T06:22:00.000Z	ruxpin	ubuntun00b	just set Driver "ati" in your xorg.conf and see if that helps
2006-11-14T06:22:00.000Z	ruxpin	ubuntun00b	run glxgears to see if the fps changed
