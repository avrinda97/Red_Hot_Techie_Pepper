2007-06-11T07:23:00.000Z	Sh3r1ff	m1r	no, you can unmount it, and after a reboot it no longer is mounted

2007-06-11T07:31:00.000Z	m1r	Sh3r1ff	, is vsftpd problem , mount -o bind /var/www/sitename /home/ftp/sitename
2007-06-11T07:31:00.000Z	Sh3r1ff	m1r	use bind -o loop for a directory to mount in another directory
2007-06-11T07:33:00.000Z	m1r	Sh3r1ff	 mounts with command , but after reboot it is unmounted in /home/ftp/sitename
2007-06-11T07:33:00.000Z	Sh3r1ff	m1r	if you want it to be permanent add it in fstab
2007-06-11T07:35:00.000Z	m1r	Sh3r1ff	how should i add it there ? like: mount --bind /var/www/sitename /home/ftp/sitename ?
2007-06-11T07:38:00.000Z	Sh3r1ff	m1r	something like /dir /dir /ext3 default 0 0

2007-06-11T07:42:00.000Z	Sh3r1ff	m1r	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/25051/
2007-06-11T08:04:00.000Z	m1r	Sh3r1ff	, it is the same , with or without in fstab :/
2007-06-11T08:05:00.000Z	Sh3r1ff	m1r	try to google how your fstab should like for a mount of that type, but has to be in fstab to be permanent
