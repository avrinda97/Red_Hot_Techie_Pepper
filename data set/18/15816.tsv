2005-01-19T08:39:00.000Z	Heretushi		Well, it's not supposed to cause problem.
2005-01-19T08:39:00.000Z	Heretushi		See, I have this DWL-G520 card that is based on the Atheros chipset which is SUPPOSED to be supported.
2005-01-19T08:40:00.000Z	Heretushi		I installed the full thing.
2005-01-19T08:41:00.000Z	Heretushi		So here I am in Ubuntu. I go into my network property, set up the thing (which is recognized) and BAM. No transmission, no nothing.
2005-01-19T08:41:00.000Z	Heretushi		Let's demonstrate by a quick screenshot.

2005-01-19T08:43:00.000Z	leslaptop	Heretushi	I would try to set it up with out IPv6 and without a wep key
2005-01-19T08:44:00.000Z	Heretushi	leslaptop	How? :)
2005-01-19T08:45:00.000Z	leslaptop	Heretushi	disable the wep key on your router
2005-01-19T08:46:00.000Z	Heretushi	leslaptop	I don't like the tought of my network being full opened! :o
2005-01-19T08:48:00.000Z	leslaptop	Heretushi	it will only be fully open until you get your card working the you will re-enable your wep key
2005-01-19T08:48:00.000Z	Heretushi	leslaptop	Yeah, that's cool. I'll try this.
2005-01-19T08:52:00.000Z	Heretushi	leslaptop	Meh. I'll check my allocation table often to see if you're there! :P
2005-01-19T08:59:00.000Z	leslaptop	Heretushi	let me know if you get it up and running please it may help me later :)
