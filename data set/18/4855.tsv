2010-01-22T20:22:00.000Z	eremite		how do I install the aurora theme engine in Karmic??  I geet getting errors in my terminal and on my appearance preferences.  Where do I get it?  Its not in the repos, but many other engines are.
2010-01-22T20:23:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	eremite	did you download an aurora.deb and install it? if so, what was the version number of it?
2010-01-22T20:24:00.000Z	eremite	onetinsoldier	 I have not downloaded the aurora engine yet.  That's exactly why I asked where I can download the engine from.  I installed a theme from gnome-look.org and it didnt have the engine with it.
2010-01-22T20:25:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	eremite	ok, use a search engine to search for the following file(if you're running 64-bit) --> aurora_1.5-1_amd64.deb
2010-01-22T20:26:00.000Z	eremite	onetinsoldier	dont tell people to use a search engine here.  Also, I am not running a 64bit machine.

2010-01-22T20:26:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	eremite	what's wrong with asking people to use a search engine?
2010-01-22T20:26:00.000Z	eremite		!google ubottu
2010-01-22T20:27:00.000Z	eremite		!google
2010-01-22T20:29:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	eremite	try this one, it might be 32-bit --> http://www.gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Aurora+Gtk+Engine?content=56438
2010-01-22T20:33:00.000Z	eremite	onetinsoldier	I found it elsewhere, but thanks for your time anyway.  I also get another error in my terminal when opening some apps.  I just opened "comix" and this is what I get" ** (comix:32656): CRITICAL **: atk_object_set_name: assertion `name != NULL' failed
2010-01-22T20:33:00.000Z	eremite		Does anyone know what this means?:: ** (comix:32656): CRITICAL **: atk_object_set_name: assertion `name != NULL' failed
2010-01-22T20:33:00.000Z	eremite		Opening apps in my terminal.
2010-01-22T20:34:00.000Z	eremite		I get an error that says:: CRITICAL **: atk_object_set_name: assertion `name != NULL' failed
2010-01-22T20:34:00.000Z	eremite		I know.
2010-01-22T20:34:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	eremite	do the apps run ok? for instance, i get some warning messages/errors when i start up gvim in a terminal, but gvim works fine. i ignore the errors, because, they're just warnings, not critical errors
2010-01-22T20:35:00.000Z	eremite	onetinsoldier	if I didnt use a terminal I wouldnt know the  errors existed.
