2008-01-19T17:36:00.000Z	szelei		is this a newbie channel?
2008-01-19T17:36:00.000Z	szelei		i'm looking for one
2008-01-19T17:36:00.000Z	szelei		fine thx
2008-01-19T17:36:00.000Z	szelei		well
2008-01-19T17:37:00.000Z	szelei		I have some problems with compiz fusion
2008-01-19T17:37:00.000Z	szelei		it seems to crash the window decorations at random times
2008-01-19T17:39:00.000Z	RB2	szelei	do you mean the titlebars disappear, etc?
2008-01-19T17:43:00.000Z	RB2	szelei	I'm trying to find the bug report on this. There were some work-arounds that seemed to work.
2008-01-19T17:43:00.000Z	szelei	RB2	thx
2008-01-19T17:48:00.000Z	RB2	szelei	sorry it's taking so long. Launchpad and I are fighting.
2008-01-19T17:49:00.000Z	szelei	RB2	no problem, I'm grateful you do this for me ;)
2008-01-19T17:54:00.000Z	RB2	szelei	I can't find the ticket. :( Are you aware of the different ways to get the window decorations back?
2008-01-19T17:56:00.000Z	szelei	RB2	switching the compiz off is a workaround (I mean it instantly restores them)
2008-01-19T17:58:00.000Z	RB2	szelei	Yeah, I usually turn off desktop effects and re-enable them and it comes back. I haven't had this problem happen in a long time for me though. *crosses fingers* What video card?
2008-01-19T17:59:00.000Z	szelei	RB2	nvidia geforce 8500GT
2008-01-19T18:02:00.000Z	RB2	szelei	NVidia here as well, 8800GTS.
2008-01-19T18:13:00.000Z	szelei	RB2	strange. Hope it will be fixed in the next release. Thanks
