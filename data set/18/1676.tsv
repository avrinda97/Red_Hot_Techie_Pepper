2011-02-05T04:11:00.000Z	manous		i told you when i use this rule it's wokr only on my server
2011-02-05T04:12:00.000Z	exutux	manous	but your dhcp server is gateway to?
2011-02-05T04:13:00.000Z	exutux	manous	for this iptables rules doesn't runs
2011-02-05T04:14:00.000Z	manous	exutux	so how can i change it ?
2011-02-05T04:14:00.000Z	exutux	manous	your dhcp server get ip but it's routed by router/gateway
2011-02-05T04:15:00.000Z	exutux	manous	what you want block for thats ip?
2011-02-05T04:16:00.000Z	exutux	manous	router/gateway is connected by a second interface at dhcp server?
2011-02-05T04:17:00.000Z	exutux	manous	is your lan dhcp server -> switch > pc > router?
2011-02-05T04:19:00.000Z	exutux	manous	so your iptables roules are bypassed
2011-02-05T04:21:00.000Z	exutux	manous	you need server dhcp on eth0 > switch > pc and server dhcp eth1 router and you can set iptables for not forward some ip trought router
2011-02-05T04:25:00.000Z	exutux	manous	easy way is a second interface connected to router in the dhcp server IMHO
2011-02-05T04:26:00.000Z	exutux	manous	or you can use router roules for to block some ip if it has
2011-02-05T04:27:00.000Z	exutux	manous	and better way is to use static ip too
2011-02-05T04:29:00.000Z	exutux	manous	you speaking about dhcp server before
2011-02-05T04:29:00.000Z	exutux	manous	i mean static ip on clients
2011-02-05T04:30:00.000Z	exutux	manous	ok
2011-02-05T04:31:00.000Z	exutux	manous	but clients that use wifi, get ip from router? or you have an iface ad-hoc configured for give an ip address to clients?
2011-02-05T04:33:00.000Z	exutux	manous	so i think that this argument becomes OT in this channel, this is a network issue IMHO
