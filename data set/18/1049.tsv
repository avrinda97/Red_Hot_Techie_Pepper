2011-07-22T22:50:00.000Z	Gunz4MiPPle		how do i connect the wifi from the cli
2011-07-22T22:50:00.000Z	terry	Gunz4MiPPle	wilist wlan scanning
2011-07-22T22:51:00.000Z	terry	Gunz4MiPPle	sudo iwlist wlan0 scanning ;  sudo dhclient wlan0  #Where wlan0 is the actual interface name.
2011-07-22T22:51:00.000Z	terry	Gunz4MiPPle	iwlconfig   #With no arguments will show your wireless NIC's name.
2011-07-22T22:56:00.000Z	terry	Gunz4MiPPle	What it the NIC name?  What does  iwconfig tell  you?
2011-07-22T22:57:00.000Z	terry	Gunz4MiPPle	Yes?
2011-07-22T22:58:00.000Z	terry	Gunz4MiPPle	What is the essid name of the router?
2011-07-22T23:01:00.000Z	terry	Gunz4MiPPle	iwconfig wifi@realtek essid LOVEBOMB
2011-07-22T23:01:00.000Z	terry	Gunz4MiPPle	And then: dhclient wifi@realtek
2011-07-22T23:03:00.000Z	terry	Gunz4MiPPle	Of course, you have to preface those commands with sudo
2011-07-22T23:03:00.000Z	terry	Gunz4MiPPle	is   WIFI@REALTEK   really the NIC name of the wifi device?
2011-07-22T23:04:00.000Z	terry	Gunz4MiPPle	What does iwconfig say it is?
2011-07-22T23:05:00.000Z	terry	Gunz4MiPPle	iwconfig <wirleless-NIC-name-here> essid <essid-of-router-here> ; dhclient <wireless-NIC-name-here>
2011-07-22T23:08:00.000Z	Gunz4MiPPle	terry	durp, i thot you mean Nickname, not the name of the nic
2011-07-22T23:12:00.000Z	terry	Gunz4MiPPle	ROLF  ?   is that in the output of   iwconfig ?
2011-07-22T23:13:00.000Z	Gunz4MiPPle	terry	yes, there is something called Nickname, but you meant the adapters name, which is wlan2
2011-07-22T23:14:00.000Z	terry	Gunz4MiPPle	If so:  iwconfig wlan2 essid LOVEBOB ; dhclient wlan2
2011-07-22T23:15:00.000Z	terry	Gunz4MiPPle	NIC -  Network Interface Card  (Sorry I should have said what is the network name for your Wireless Netwrok Interface.)
