2007-03-23T13:45:00.000Z	aoirthoir		any way to make gnome always open my windows the same size and same place?
2007-03-23T13:45:00.000Z	ardchoille	aoirthoir	That would be the job of the window manager and Metacity doesn't do it afaik
2007-03-23T13:46:00.000Z	aoirthoir	ardchoille	thanks jrib just gave me a link.
2007-03-23T15:22:00.000Z	ardchoille	aoirthoir	How did you get them all to open maximised? I would like to be able to do that.
2007-03-23T15:24:00.000Z	aoirthoir	ardchoille	if I close a window when it is maximized..it opens maximized...running gnome. Even the devilspy...while it will adjust the size of non-maxmized windows..will still not prevent a window from opening maximized if it was set that way when clsoed
2007-03-23T15:25:00.000Z	ardchoille	aoirthoir	Seems your complain is with devilspie. Maybe contact the devs or file a bug report?
2007-03-23T15:26:00.000Z	aoirthoir	ardchoille	i only tried devilspy today just a little while ago. This behaviour of all of my windows opening maximised is constant (that is if they were maxmized when I closed them)
2007-03-23T15:26:00.000Z	ardchoille	aoirthoir	Ah, ok, the apps are saving prefs I guess.
2007-03-23T15:26:00.000Z	aoirthoir	ardchoille	I was hoping gnome (or kde) had a setting to prevent that
2007-03-23T15:26:00.000Z	aoirthoir	ardchoille	ah possibly..dont know how to override that.
2007-03-23T15:27:00.000Z	ardchoille	aoirthoir	In gnome on Dapper, if I close an app that is max'ed, it opens normal later.
2007-03-23T15:27:00.000Z	aoirthoir	ardchoille	running edgy myself...if I do it with say the terminal..it opens regular..firefox always opens max
2007-03-23T15:30:00.000Z	aoirthoir	ardchoille	it has to be sans something...sans means without
2007-03-23T15:30:00.000Z	ardchoille	aoirthoir	Nope, just sans: http://img466.imageshack.us/img466/3845/fontspz1.jpg
2007-03-23T15:31:00.000Z	aoirthoir	ardchoille	they have the name wrong then
2007-03-23T15:31:00.000Z	ardchoille	aoirthoir	That may be.
2007-03-23T15:31:00.000Z	aoirthoir	ardchoille	technically ubunut is without a font then:)
2007-03-24T16:11:00.000Z	ardchoille	aoirthoir	, l90bpm Please take this stuff to #ubuntu-offtopic
