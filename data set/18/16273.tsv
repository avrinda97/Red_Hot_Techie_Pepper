2004-10-23T06:39:00.000Z	swim		can anyone tell me how to add a port (printer ip address) please?
2004-10-23T06:40:00.000Z	aitrus	swim	is the printer connected via some network device (like a jetdirect interface)?
2004-10-23T06:41:00.000Z	swim	aitrus	the printer has a built in nic, and is connected from that to a router... and my computer to that router
2004-10-23T06:44:00.000Z	swim	aitrus	I can use it with a windows machine... so the printer itself is setup
2004-10-23T06:45:00.000Z	aitrus	swim	does it use IPP or SMB in windows?
2004-10-23T06:45:00.000Z	swim	aitrus	I just told windows to use the ip address that the printer gave itself...
2004-10-23T06:46:00.000Z	swim	aitrus	sorry I didnt tell it either... ok just a sec
2004-10-23T06:56:00.000Z	aitrus	swim	i meant i don't know which of the network printing protocols windows is using for your particular printer
2004-10-23T06:57:00.000Z	swim	aitrus	can I somehow try whaterver is available?
2004-10-23T06:59:00.000Z	aitrus	swim	sure, just use the printer setup gui and fill in as much info as you can... just select networked-printer and go for it
2004-10-23T07:29:00.000Z	swim	aitrus	so what would a URI be?
2004-10-23T07:30:00.000Z	swim	aitrus	or for that matter, what would a SBM number or whatever look like?
2004-10-23T07:31:00.000Z	aitrus	swim	i can't help you if you don't know what your printer uses, sorry.  from what you have told me, your printer is not using SMB.  so it's either IPP or LPR
2004-10-23T07:32:00.000Z	aitrus	swim	if there is some sort of config interface for your printer (like a web interface) that would help [you]  a lot
2004-10-23T07:33:00.000Z	swim	aitrus	ok so if it were LPR what number or name... would I be looking for?
2004-10-24T15:41:00.000Z	swim	aitrus	no, does ubuntu not do that by default?
2004-10-24T15:42:00.000Z	aitrus	swim	no.  most distro's don't.  just grab it from sun's site
2004-10-25T05:32:00.000Z	aitrus	swim	7 ghz!  that's a great machine!
