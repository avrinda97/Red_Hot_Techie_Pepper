2012-08-12T06:07:00.000Z	Shazer[2]		:)
2012-08-12T06:08:00.000Z	Shazer[2]		i have downloaded Sublime Text 2, and I've extracted it now I need to run the binary.
2012-08-12T06:08:00.000Z	Shazer[2]		I've done ./sublime_text but it says no such file or directory.
2012-08-12T06:08:00.000Z	Shazer[2]		Double clicking also won't open it.
2012-08-12T06:08:00.000Z	Shazer[2]		Anyone have any ideas?
2012-08-12T06:10:00.000Z	cvr	Shazer[2]	I just downloaded and extracted the file works fine from here
2012-08-12T06:10:00.000Z	Shazer[2]		Any idea why it would say that?
2012-08-12T06:10:00.000Z	Shazer[2]		Hmm :(
2012-08-12T06:10:00.000Z	Shazer[2]		That's all I tried too.
2012-08-12T06:11:00.000Z	Shazer[2]		shannon@ubuntu:~/Downloads/Sublime Text 2$ ls -l ./sublime_text -rwxr-xr-x 1 shannon shannon 7972576 Jul 14 10:07 ./sublime_text
2012-08-12T06:12:00.000Z	Shazer[2]		But then
2012-08-12T06:12:00.000Z	Shazer[2]		shannon@ubuntu:~/Downloads/Sublime Text 2$ ./sublime_text bash: ./sublime_text: No such file or directory
