2011-06-10T14:55:00.000Z	sipior	Moopz	could you pastebin the result of "sudo -l", and "sudo -ll <whichever command you wanted to run>"?
2011-06-10T14:56:00.000Z	Moopz	sipior	Sure, give me a minute.
2011-06-10T14:58:00.000Z	Moopz	sipior	http://pastebin.com/taqik5aH - I cannot run sudo -ll app because it apparently cannot find it when I use sudo
2011-06-10T15:00:00.000Z	sipior	Moopz	well, there's your problem. what sort of program is this? what's the output of the "file" command on the executable?
2011-06-10T15:01:00.000Z	Moopz	sipior	It's Xilinx - A program for FPGAs. the command i run is gksudo ise - Which I know is the right executable because I can launch it just fine without sudo but it doesn't function properly unless it has sudo.
2011-06-10T15:01:00.000Z	sipior	Moopz	and the file command?
2011-06-10T15:02:00.000Z	Moopz	sipior	There is no file command. It's GUI program.
2011-06-10T15:02:00.000Z	sipior	Moopz	"file ise"
2011-06-10T15:03:00.000Z	sipior	Moopz	and when you run it via sudo, it drops out without prompting for a password?
2011-06-10T15:04:00.000Z	Moopz	sipior	it says it cannot find it when I use sudo: sudo: ise: command not found
2011-06-10T15:04:00.000Z	sipior	Moopz	what about "sudo ./ise"?
2011-06-10T15:05:00.000Z	sipior	Moopz	or simply provide the full path to the executable, if you prefer.
2011-06-10T15:06:00.000Z	Moopz	sipior	Yeah I forgot that part. It launched but without prompting me for password. Can you force it to prompt the password?
2011-06-10T15:07:00.000Z	sipior	Moopz	you can try "sudo -K" to remove the timestamp, then try again.
2011-06-10T15:08:00.000Z	sipior	Moopz	another thing to try: get a root shell via "sudo -i", and then try running the executable directly.
2011-06-10T15:11:00.000Z	Moopz	sipior	Well it seems to work alright with the sudo now, but it still cannot launch external applications. But I think I'll take a look at their website.
2011-06-10T15:12:00.000Z	Moopz	sipior	So I thank you for your assistance.
2011-06-10T15:12:00.000Z	sipior	Moopz	no trouble, best of luck getting things working properly.
