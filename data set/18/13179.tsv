2005-12-29T08:20:00.000Z	fractalmbrown		if anyone recognizes me from last night, I was the one who had GRUB MBR corruption issues. That has been fixed, and I booted into Ubuntu fine
2005-12-29T08:20:00.000Z	MrPrimate	fractalmbrown	good to hear it
2005-12-29T08:21:00.000Z	MrPrimate	fractalmbrown	unfortunately for me I have bad cdroms or burner
2005-12-29T08:37:00.000Z	fractalmbrown	MrPrimate	gotta love recursive acronyms ;)
2005-12-29T08:37:00.000Z	MrPrimate	fractalmbrown	:)
2005-12-29T08:39:00.000Z	MrPrimate	fractalmbrown	whats the error when you try to run these ?
2005-12-29T08:39:00.000Z	fractalmbrown	MrPrimate	there is no error. Ubuntu just asks for a password, and when I enter it, it makes the button noise and doesn't do anything
2005-12-29T08:40:00.000Z	MrPrimate	fractalmbrown	so your wrong password or you think its broke ?
2005-12-29T08:40:00.000Z	MrPrimate	fractalmbrown	are you in sudoers
2005-12-29T08:41:00.000Z	fractalmbrown	MrPrimate	how do I check if I'm in sudoers?
2005-12-29T09:34:00.000Z	MrPrimate	fractalmbrown	whcih nvidia card do you have
2005-12-29T09:35:00.000Z	MrPrimate	fractalmbrown	nvidia drivers work well in linux
2005-12-29T09:35:00.000Z	MrPrimate	fractalmbrown	get the driver from nvidia, it works great
2005-12-29T09:35:00.000Z	MrPrimate	fractalmbrown	don't use the nv driver
2005-12-29T09:35:00.000Z	fractalmbrown	MrPrimate	yes, but there are multiple choices
2005-12-29T09:35:00.000Z	MrPrimate	fractalmbrown	such as? list?
2005-12-29T09:36:00.000Z	MrPrimate	fractalmbrown	if you're not 64-bit you want IA32
2005-12-29T09:36:00.000Z	MrPrimate	fractalmbrown	I assume you don't have an AMD64 or intel64
