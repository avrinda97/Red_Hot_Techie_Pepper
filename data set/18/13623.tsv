2006-03-21T17:41:00.000Z	RabidDog		Looking for help with multip tcp/ip connections, I want the comp to use eth1 for local lan only, and I want it to use eth0 for internet access, I have 2 modems 1 connected to a router which connects to eth1 and a 2nd modem which connects directly to eth0, any ideas how to configure this properly?

2006-03-21T17:43:00.000Z	IceBreak	RabidDog	isnt that just a matter of setting netmask ?
2006-03-21T17:43:00.000Z	RabidDog	IceBreak	I have no idea is it, this part is all new to me?
2006-03-21T17:44:00.000Z	IceBreak	RabidDog	the eth0 has an 10.0.0.x ip and th eth1 has an 192.168.0.x ip ?
2006-03-21T17:44:00.000Z	RabidDog	IceBreak	yes
2006-03-21T17:44:00.000Z	IceBreak	RabidDog	and it doesnt work that way currently?
2006-03-21T17:45:00.000Z	RabidDog	IceBreak	no my outgoing apps can't connect
2006-03-21T17:45:00.000Z	IceBreak	RabidDog	so basically you just didnt configure your internet properly, yeah ? It's nothing todo with network layout
2006-03-21T17:46:00.000Z	RabidDog	IceBreak	if u say so, so what do i do?
2006-03-21T17:46:00.000Z	IceBreak	RabidDog	learn how to configure internet proerply in linux, i'm sure there is plenty of doucmentation for that
2006-03-21T17:47:00.000Z	RabidDog	IceBreak	actually no there is virtually no documentation on dual wan
2006-03-21T17:47:00.000Z	IceBreak	RabidDog	but your problem isnt related.. from whwat i understand, if you have only eth0 connected, it still doesnt work, no ?
2006-03-21T17:50:00.000Z	RabidDog	IceBreak	ok seems to be connecting now, how do I tell certain apps to use certain internet connections only?
2006-03-21T17:51:00.000Z	IceBreak	RabidDog	you dont... it's not in that layer
2006-03-21T17:51:00.000Z	IceBreak	RabidDog	but you could use "route" for routing ip via interfaces
2006-03-21T17:52:00.000Z	IceBreak	RabidDog	eth1 will be used for all communcation to 192.168.0.x ips
