2007-11-02T01:00:00.000Z	sam_		I have gutsy and a Broadcom Corporation BCM4312  the restricted driver manager says that firmware for broadcom 43xxx is in use. iwconfig shows http://pastebin.ca/758030 but network manager wireless is all 'greyed out' and inaccessible. Why?
2007-11-02T01:02:00.000Z	MystaMax	sam_	if you right click NM does it show that wireless is enabled?
2007-11-02T01:02:00.000Z	sam_	MystaMax	'roaming mode is enabled'
2007-11-02T01:03:00.000Z	MystaMax	sam_	sorry but u didnt answer my question
2007-11-02T01:04:00.000Z	sam_	MystaMax	I have a window open that says 'network manager' at the top. do you mean the panel applet?
2007-11-02T01:05:00.000Z	MystaMax	sam_	yes the panel applet, which is called nm-applet
2007-11-02T01:07:00.000Z	sam_	MystaMax	I have a applet called 'Network monitor' I do not see a applet called network manager anywhere
2007-11-02T01:08:00.000Z	MystaMax	sam_	open terminal and type nm-applet
2007-11-02T01:09:00.000Z	sam_	MystaMax	nothing happened. Should i sudo? sam@sam-laptop:~$ nm-applet
2007-11-02T01:10:00.000Z	MystaMax	sam_	do you have "Notification area" added to your panel?
2007-11-02T01:11:00.000Z	MystaMax	sam_	ok so left click the nm-applet and see if you see any networks
2007-11-02T01:15:00.000Z	MystaMax	sam_	so if you left click the nm-applet what do you see?
2007-11-02T01:17:00.000Z	MystaMax	sam_	try rebooting, also is your SSID on broadcast?
2007-11-02T01:20:00.000Z	MystaMax	sam_	its my suggestion, either you do or you don't
2007-11-02T01:26:00.000Z	MystaMax	sam_	any luck
2007-11-02T01:26:00.000Z	sam_	MystaMax	yes :)
2007-11-02T01:26:00.000Z	MystaMax	sam_	wait so the reboot worked?
2007-11-02T01:27:00.000Z	MystaMax	sam_	so you understand what happen, i don't think nm-applet was running, and when you ran it at the CLI it started it but couldn't find any networks. I have the same Broadcom card
