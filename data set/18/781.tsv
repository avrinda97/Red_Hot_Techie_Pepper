2012-09-18T21:10:00.000Z	mangdood	IdleOne	thanks
2012-09-18T21:12:00.000Z	IdleOne	mangdood	sudo apt-get install --reinstall kubuntu-desktop
2012-09-18T21:12:00.000Z	mangdood	IdleOne	I'll give it a try
2012-09-18T21:13:00.000Z	mangdood	IdleOne	The reinstallation process went by way too fast for me to guess that it reinstalled all of the dependencies of the metapackage
2012-09-18T21:15:00.000Z	IdleOne	mangdood	if there wasn't any errors it completed successfully
2012-09-18T21:16:00.000Z	mangdood	IdleOne	Would it have checked its dependencies for problems?
2012-09-18T21:16:00.000Z	IdleOne	mangdood	yes.
2012-09-18T21:18:00.000Z	mangdood	IdleOne	Even using a fresh home/user, I still get problems with specific applications from that package though. Doesn't that indicate a problem with the system?
2012-09-18T21:19:00.000Z	IdleOne	mangdood	it indicates a problem with those specific packages. What exactly is the issue?
2012-09-18T21:20:00.000Z	mangdood	IdleOne	Urgh. I have less than 10 minutes before I need to leave
2012-09-18T21:20:00.000Z	IdleOne	mangdood	Come back when you have more time than :)
2012-09-18T21:20:00.000Z	mangdood	IdleOne	Basically, certain widgets and kde applications will cause my session and system to lock up
2012-09-18T21:21:00.000Z	IdleOne	mangdood	I'm not sure I can be of any help with that but I suspect that the problem is plasmoid specific and not the entire system.
2012-09-18T21:21:00.000Z	IdleOne	mangdood	try reinstalling the plasmoids in question
2012-09-18T21:22:00.000Z	mangdood	IdleOne	I tried that, with a mysterious error telling me that some part of the installation failed. :D... I'll have to work on this when I get back..
2012-09-18T21:23:00.000Z	IdleOne	mangdood	We will be here
2012-09-18T21:23:00.000Z	mangdood	IdleOne	:p
