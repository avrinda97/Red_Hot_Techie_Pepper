2007-10-22T09:26:00.000Z	ndan	koshari	my sound drivers won't work :-\

2007-10-22T09:27:00.000Z	ndan	koshari	i installed realtek-linux-audiopack-4.07a which was supposed to fix it... but instead of drivers that didn't work (no sound) like i had... i now have no drivers recognized by the system
2007-10-22T09:29:00.000Z	koshari	ndan	can you remove the realtek audio pak?
2007-10-22T09:30:00.000Z	koshari	ndan	have you read this http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=257304
2007-10-22T09:30:00.000Z	ndan	koshari	interesting question i dunno how to uninstall it
2007-10-22T09:31:00.000Z	ndan	koshari	yes i read and followed that before to no avail
2007-10-22T09:31:00.000Z	ndan		before installing the realtek stuff
2007-10-22T09:33:00.000Z	koshari	ndan	what version of ubuntu are you using?
2007-10-22T09:33:00.000Z	ndan	koshari	7.10 the Gutsy Gibbon
2007-10-22T09:34:00.000Z	koshari	ndan	does it work with the live cd?
2007-10-22T09:34:00.000Z	ndan		no
2007-10-22T09:34:00.000Z	ndan	koshari	its not worked since i got into linux at all.  i mean orignially it had drivers that didn't work and in alsamixer you could change any bar but Master was stuck at 0
2007-10-22T09:37:00.000Z	koshari	ndan	without having the same chipset therse no much i can do for you , maybe you can start a thread for gutsy alc861 on ubuntuforums and see if anyone has a workaround.
2007-10-22T09:37:00.000Z	ndan	koshari	thanks alright i shall do that.  I appreciate your aide.
