2009-01-01T23:22:00.000Z	hateball	chupy	9, I assume? Suppose you could try grabbing 10 from adobe.com. If you grab something with youtube-dl, does that play properly in say... Totem?
2009-01-01T23:23:00.000Z	chupy	hateball	Shockwave Flash 10.0 r15
2009-01-01T23:25:00.000Z	chupy	hateball	: Shockwave Flash 10.0 r15
2009-01-01T23:27:00.000Z	hateball	chupy	I'm on 64bit, so I cant help much more. You could as I said, try downloading something with youtube-dl and watching that in Totem
