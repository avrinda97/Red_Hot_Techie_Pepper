2009-12-13T03:31:00.000Z	Alexia_Death	thermal_	never played starcraft, but scale is not what you need I think, you just need to set biger resolution.
2009-12-13T03:29:00.000Z	Alexia_Death	thermal_	For windows games you usually need to change the resolution inside the game.
2009-12-13T03:30:00.000Z	thermal_	Alexia_Death	can't change the resolution of starcraft
2009-12-13T03:32:00.000Z	thermal_	Alexia_Death	you literally can't change the resolution of starcraft, its fixed at 640x480
2009-12-13T03:33:00.000Z	Alexia_Death	thermal_	if the game wont allow you to that then make it full screen nothong more you can do
2009-12-13T03:34:00.000Z	thermal_	Alexia_Death	no it is full screen, wine and virtual box won't expand the 640x480 full screen out
2009-12-13T03:34:00.000Z	Alexia_Death	thermal_	you have a laptop?
2009-12-13T03:35:00.000Z	Alexia_Death	thermal_	or an ldc monitor?
2009-12-13T03:35:00.000Z	thermal_	Alexia_Death	yes I do, but I don't use my laptop at home, trying to get this working on my desktop
2009-12-13T03:35:00.000Z	thermal_	Alexia_Death	my desktop monitors are lcds
2009-12-13T03:36:00.000Z	Alexia_Death	thermal_	some displays (LCD, laptops) display lower rez in a box and wont scal it over scree,
2009-12-13T03:36:00.000Z	Alexia_Death	thermal_	is that what happens for you?'
2009-12-13T03:37:00.000Z	thermal_	Alexia_Death	I can run wine virtual desktop and virtual box perfectly fine at higher res, but starcraft drops down to 640x480
2009-12-13T03:37:00.000Z	Alexia_Death	thermal_	dont run it in a virtual desktop.
2009-12-13T03:38:00.000Z	Alexia_Death	thermal_	if that is used then thats what it scales
2009-12-13T03:38:00.000Z	Alexia_Death	thermal_	same for virtualbox.
2009-12-13T03:38:00.000Z	Alexia_Death	thermal_	thats just how it works.
