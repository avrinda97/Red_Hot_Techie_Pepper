2008-01-24T17:36:00.000Z	_Ergo_	punzada	: i would imagine that is dangerous ?
2008-01-24T17:37:00.000Z	punzada		that's what the developers are trying to work around :)
2008-01-24T17:37:00.000Z	punzada		lol
2008-01-24T17:38:00.000Z	punzada		but once it's all settled, the thoughts of windows gaming almost natively on nix-based operating systems through virtualization is a fantastic thought
2008-01-24T17:40:00.000Z	_Ergo_	punzada	: and how you will overcome the windows licensing ?
2008-01-24T17:41:00.000Z	_Ergo_		you need to have a license anyway, so why not install windows when you have it - for gaming for example?
2008-01-24T17:41:00.000Z	punzada	_Ergo_	 ... so you don't have to reboot your system?
2008-01-24T17:41:00.000Z	_Ergo_	punzada	: - thats not an issue for me, and i doubt that ppl will game on servers for example ;-)
2008-01-24T17:41:00.000Z	_Ergo_		i would play natively on linux tho
2008-01-24T17:43:00.000Z	punzada	_Ergo_	nix is hardly a server-only platform in this day and age :)
2008-01-24T17:43:00.000Z	punzada		granted, some distros are lol
2008-01-24T17:44:00.000Z	_Ergo_	punzada	, sure , but its hardly a revolution when you woulkd have to buy windows to play on linux , even if performance would be decent
2008-01-24T17:45:00.000Z	punzada		I don't know, seems like a nice step in bringing over both a new demographic and even though I barely game anymore ... I'm a big proponent of being able to totally utilize multiple operating systems for whatever purpose.
2008-01-24T17:46:00.000Z	_Ergo_	punzada	: , i would say that the best solution would be allowin software to run and compile on various systems fairly easly - that would be revolution
2008-01-24T17:46:00.000Z	punzada	_Ergo_	 at this point in time that would also be daydreaming :)
2008-01-24T17:47:00.000Z	_Ergo_	punzada	: : if i could buy whatever i want , adobe, autodesk - and run it on linux
2008-01-24T17:47:00.000Z	_Ergo_	punzada	its not daydreaming - ID software - its only a matter of time and skill i guess and will to do so
