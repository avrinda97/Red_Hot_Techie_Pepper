2007-04-28T13:48:00.000Z	darx		i'd like to strip down feisty to the bare minimum reqired for my laptop. can someone direct me to a comprehensive guide somewhere?
2007-04-28T07:36:00.000Z	darx		how can i get feisty to play real streams?
2007-04-28T07:37:00.000Z	sanityx	darx	As in real player streams?
2007-04-28T07:37:00.000Z	darx	sanityx	yup.. :)
2007-04-28T07:37:00.000Z	sanityx	darx	You could just install real player.
2007-04-28T07:37:00.000Z	sanityx	darx	There is a linux version.
2007-04-28T07:37:00.000Z	darx	sanityx	i cant find it in the repos.. where is it?
2007-04-28T07:38:00.000Z	sanityx	darx	It's probably not in the repos. http://www.real.com/linux/
2007-04-28T07:38:00.000Z	sanityx		it comes in a .bin
2007-04-28T07:38:00.000Z	sanityx		easy to install. not so easy to uninstall.
2007-04-28T07:38:00.000Z	darx	sanityx	hmm.. hope its a .deb
2007-04-28T07:39:00.000Z	sanityx	darx	 no its a .bin, which is basically a self contained package.
2007-04-28T07:39:00.000Z	sanityx	darx	 it contains the software, as well as a script to install it. you just execute it like this. ./foo.bin
2007-04-28T07:39:00.000Z	darx	sanityx	aargh... is there an uninstall script as well?
2007-04-28T07:39:00.000Z	sanityx	darx	I don't know for sure. But I would guess no.
2007-04-28T07:41:00.000Z	sanityx	darx	http://www.youmortals.com/ubuntu/packages/realplayer_10.0.7-0.0_i386.deb
2007-04-28T07:41:00.000Z	sanityx		Darx: There you go. A deb. so you can remove it with dpkg
2007-04-28T07:42:00.000Z	darx	sanityx	thanks.. you are a star :)
