2011-11-16T04:38:00.000Z	zykotick9	tanath	FYI vga= is a deprecated kernel option these days
2011-11-16T04:40:00.000Z	tanath	zykotick9	that's why i removed it
2011-11-16T04:41:00.000Z	tanath	zykotick9	fixed my VT problem for regular boot, but not recovery mode
2012-03-15T21:51:00.000Z	zykotick9	tanath	gnome-shell obviously requires bluez, why are you trying to remove it?
2012-03-15T21:51:00.000Z	tanath	zykotick9	i don't have bluetooth
2012-03-15T21:51:00.000Z	zykotick9	tanath	so?  why are you removing it?
2012-03-15T21:51:00.000Z	tanath	zykotick9	and don't want unnecessary packages
2012-03-15T21:51:00.000Z	tanath	zykotick9	because i want to.
2012-03-15T21:53:00.000Z	tanath	zykotick9	and i'd be happy to remove gnome-shell to get rid of everything bluetooth, but i can't, because removing it requires isntallation of unity
2012-03-15T21:54:00.000Z	zykotick9	tanath	you are fighting with meta-packages...
2012-03-15T21:54:00.000Z	tanath	zykotick9	i'm fighting pointless dependencies
2012-03-15T21:55:00.000Z	tanath	zykotick9	if there's a metapackage responsible that i'm missing, i'd like to know
2012-03-15T21:55:00.000Z	zykotick9	tanath	if you want a custom ubuntu, start with the mini iso and only install what you want (and avoid large meta-packages)
2012-03-15T21:56:00.000Z	zykotick9	tanath	ubuntu uses some, overreaching, metapackages unfortunatly (makes things easier for most users)
2012-03-15T21:56:00.000Z	tanath	zykotick9	mm
2012-03-15T21:56:00.000Z	tanath	zykotick9	but increasingly it's harder to customize well
2012-03-15T21:56:00.000Z	zykotick9	tanath	agreed
2012-03-15T21:57:00.000Z	tanath	zykotick9	i have a lot of packages i want installed where i don't even remember what they are... and couldn't remember them all again
