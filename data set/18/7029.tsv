2008-04-20T21:38:00.000Z	murlidhar	LordInfamous	if u have windows xp cd . it would be best to fix the mbr. however u have to reinstall thr grub in the mbr later
2008-04-20T21:39:00.000Z	murlidhar	LordInfamous	one sec let me see

2008-04-20T21:42:00.000Z	murlidhar	LordInfamous	u can follow that
2008-04-20T21:46:00.000Z	LordInfamous	murlidhar	when i try to install the ms-sys package i get an error that it couldnt be found
2008-04-20T21:48:00.000Z	murlidhar	LordInfamous	hmm
2008-04-20T21:50:00.000Z	LordInfamous	murlidhar	i found it on sourceforge, http://ms-sys.sourceforge.net/#Download
2008-04-20T21:51:00.000Z	murlidhar	LordInfamous	yes but i would be difficult method to install from there . let me see if there is any other alternate way
2008-04-20T22:04:00.000Z	murlidhar	LordInfamous	just ask ikonia that u want to fix mbr since none of ur operating system is booting
2008-04-20T22:13:00.000Z	murlidhar	LordInfamous	did ur problem get solved ?
