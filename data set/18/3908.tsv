2009-07-06T20:49:00.000Z	sebsebseb	donks	on  a PC  it's simple,  you just  install  Windows for example, and it goes over  Grub
2009-07-06T20:49:00.000Z	donks	sebsebseb	the linux was on a pc
2009-07-06T20:49:00.000Z	sebsebseb	donks	you got rid of Ubuntu?
2009-07-06T20:49:00.000Z	sebsebseb	donks	why?
2009-07-06T20:49:00.000Z	donks	sebsebseb	my pc wont boot from the win disc, i have changed the boot order and tryed 2 drives
2009-07-06T20:50:00.000Z	donks	sebsebseb	i was going to install win 7 so i re partitioned my second drive then i was going to put both on
2009-07-06T20:50:00.000Z	sebsebseb	donks	ok install Windows first
2009-07-06T20:50:00.000Z	sebsebseb	donks	then put Ubuntu back on, that's the easiest way to do it
