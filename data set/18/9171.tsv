2008-10-31T00:20:00.000Z	askand		Ok, I am a newbie with nvidia cards..I am given the choice to install version 173 or 177, what should I choose?
2008-10-31T00:20:00.000Z	askand		Ive got a nVidia Corporation GeForce 6150SE
2008-10-31T00:21:00.000Z	jimmio	askand	I'm pretty sure they both support that card... I'd go with the older one though, as that is a pretty dated card.
2008-10-31T00:21:00.000Z	askand	jimmio	Do you think I will have better performance using the older driver?
2008-10-31T00:22:00.000Z	jimmio	askand	It shouldn't matter either way.... I'd stick to the older one to be on the safe side though.
2008-10-31T00:26:00.000Z	askand	jimmio	ok how often does nvidia drivers get out for linux?
2008-10-31T00:26:00.000Z	jimmio	askand	You won't need to update.... for a LONG time
2008-10-31T00:26:00.000Z	askand	jimmio	= they does not release very often :(
2008-10-31T00:27:00.000Z	jimmio	askand	= they're dropping support slowly with new drivers
2008-10-31T00:27:00.000Z	askand	jimmio	:( I knew I should have bought an aticard
2008-10-31T00:28:00.000Z	jimmio	askand	That card is ANCIENT...
2008-10-31T00:28:00.000Z	jimmio	askand	Well, ancient in today's terms =P I have a 6800...
2008-10-31T00:29:00.000Z	askand	jimmio	that would explain the price.. you dont happen to know if I can have both an integrated card and a regular card and only using the latter?
2008-10-31T00:30:00.000Z	jimmio	askand	Yup, just disable the internal video from the bios, you should be fine. if you plan on upgrading, I'd go for an 8800 GT, cheap, and only one PCIe 2.0 x16 slot
2008-10-31T00:30:00.000Z	askand	jimmio	Aha I tought you meant they were dropping support slowly for all cards :)
2008-10-31T00:32:00.000Z	jimmio	askand	Ohhh, no no no... xD they dropped 3D support for GeForce 4000's... 6's are fine for now though
2008-10-31T00:32:00.000Z	askand	jimmio	ok thanks! will check 8800b GT out!
2008-10-31T00:33:00.000Z	jimmio	askand	np =D
