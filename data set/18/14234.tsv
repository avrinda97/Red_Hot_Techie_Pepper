2005-10-03T10:16:00.000Z	oblib		question: Ubuntu does not mount my serial ATA drive during boot and returns an error that it cannot find the device (it is in fstab). I think that it is trying to mount it before it recognizes the serial ATA. Does anyone know how I can fix this?
2005-10-03T10:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	oblib	 interesting.. does 'fdisk -l' show the device?
2005-10-03T10:19:00.000Z	oblib	Dr_Willis	yes
2005-10-03T10:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	oblib	 if fdisk -l shows it.. check your fstab entry - it may just be wrong.
2005-10-03T10:20:00.000Z	oblib	Dr_Willis	I can mount just fine once I'm in Ubuntu. fstab says :/dev/sda1       /win/f          ntfs    auto,nls=utf8,umask=0222 0       0
2005-10-03T10:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	oblib	 mine mount fine.  I dont recall having that 'auto' option in the fstab however
2005-10-03T10:23:00.000Z	oblib	Dr_Willis	nalioth had me put it in
2005-10-03T10:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	oblib	 /dev/sdb1       /media/sdb1     ntfs ro,user   0 2
2005-10-03T10:24:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	oblib	 is what i use.
2005-10-03T10:24:00.000Z	oblib	Dr_Willis	do you know how I could add a manual mount command later in the boot process? I think the SATA is the last thing the boot does before it's done
2005-10-03T10:25:00.000Z	oblib	Dr_Willis	Do you know what the 0 2 does at the end?
2005-10-03T10:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	oblib	 Hmm... not sure - could out the sata modules in the  /etc/modules file - so they get loaed earlier perhaps
2005-10-03T10:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	oblib	 i forget. :P
2005-10-03T10:26:00.000Z	oblib	Dr_Willis	"could out" ?
2005-10-03T10:28:00.000Z	oblib	Dr_Willis	would that be module sbp2 or sr_mod?
2005-10-03T10:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	oblib	 not sure.   put them both in the modules file. :P
2005-10-03T10:29:00.000Z	oblib	Dr_Willis	those are the modules that are there. Does altering the order change things?
2005-10-03T10:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	oblib	 i wouldent think so,
