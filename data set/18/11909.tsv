2007-08-11T15:05:00.000Z	bruenig	jacob	you might find an uninstall.exe, you should try that too
2007-08-11T15:06:00.000Z	jacob	bruenig	in what directory path will i be able to run the uninstall exe?
2007-08-11T15:06:00.000Z	bruenig	jacob	in the Program Files folder of your program, this is all very program specific
2007-08-11T15:07:00.000Z	jacob	bruenig	what i'm trying to say is how will the command lline look like if i want to run uninstall.exe?
2007-08-11T15:07:00.000Z	jacob	bruenig	i will need to run the uninstall.exe using wine again right?
2007-08-11T15:08:00.000Z	bruenig	jacob	what
2007-08-11T15:08:00.000Z	jacob	bruenig	to run the uninstall.exe, i will need to run wine again
2007-08-11T15:08:00.000Z	bruenig	jacob	yeah... you do understand how wine works right?
2007-08-11T15:08:00.000Z	jacob	bruenig	how will the command line look like (the directory path) to run the uninstall.exe
2007-08-11T15:09:00.000Z	bruenig	jacob	it depends on the program and the program may not even have one
