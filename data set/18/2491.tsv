2010-05-16T14:02:00.000Z	chouchou		hello, pls I am having permission error from my Ubuntu PC
2010-05-16T14:03:00.000Z	chouchou		I can't modify most of the files
2010-05-16T14:03:00.000Z	chouchou		from a web interface of via ftp
2010-05-16T14:03:00.000Z	chouchou		what do i do?
2010-05-16T14:05:00.000Z	wildbat_laptop	chouchou	learn to use period instead of <enter> key.  i think you don't own the file that's y
2010-05-16T14:06:00.000Z	chouchou	wildbat_laptop	most of then were set using the root account,
2010-05-16T14:07:00.000Z	wildbat_laptop	chouchou	that's y ~ so only root can change the permission now
2010-05-16T14:10:00.000Z	wildbat_laptop	chouchou	but ur files own by root as you said.'
2010-05-16T14:11:00.000Z	chouchou	wildbat_laptop	yes, in fact I have installed proftpd and LAMP, from my root account,
2010-05-16T14:13:00.000Z	wildbat_laptop	chouchou	keep in mind that the apache2 deamon isn't run by root account . ~
2010-05-16T14:16:00.000Z	wildbat_laptop	chouchou	you have to change chown of the files.
2010-05-16T14:17:00.000Z	wildbat_laptop	chouchou	sudo chown someuser:www-data <file>
2010-05-16T14:18:00.000Z	chouchou	wildbat_laptop	will the same apply to ftp too?
2010-05-16T14:21:00.000Z	wildbat_laptop	chouchou	the login ftp user (can be virtualuser, in that case the ftpd user) will need to own the file in order to change the files permission.
2010-05-16T14:29:00.000Z	chouchou	wildbat_laptop	changing the owner for the we reduced the error, what abou the FTP?
2010-05-16T14:38:00.000Z	wildbat_laptop	chouchou	i said the user have to match the ftp user
2010-05-16T14:39:00.000Z	wildbat_laptop	chouchou	yes
2010-05-16T14:40:00.000Z	wildbat_laptop	chouchou	said if your ftp login in dummy123, the files should own by dummy123 : www-data
