2005-04-26T14:20:00.000Z	zemantic		i got a laptop here with no boot floppy and no cdrom, running mandrake, is there any chance I can get ubuntu on this?
2005-04-26T14:21:00.000Z	zemantic		some kind of local mount boot?
2005-04-26T14:21:00.000Z	zemantic		it's got network, just no bootable devices other than the hard drive
2005-04-26T14:22:00.000Z	djm62	zemantic	how is the hard disk partitioned?
2005-04-26T14:22:00.000Z	zemantic	djm62	all mandrake
2005-04-26T14:22:00.000Z	djm62	zemantic	any chance of booting from usb?
2005-04-26T14:22:00.000Z	djm62	zemantic	how many partitions for mandrake?
2005-04-26T14:22:00.000Z	zemantic	djm62	i don't think so, I'm willing to trash mandrake
2005-04-26T14:23:00.000Z	zemantic	djm62	i mean i don't think so (USB)
2005-04-26T14:24:00.000Z	zemantic	djm62	do you or anyone know if there are ubuntu bootalbe floppies?
2005-04-26T14:24:00.000Z	zemantic		I might be able to hack in a floppy drive
2005-04-26T14:24:00.000Z	djm62	zemantic	if you have room/memory you can do 'swapoff' then make your swap partition bootable (maybe with GNU parted on it) then add that to grub/lilo, and use it to resize mdk to make room for ubuntu
2005-04-26T14:25:00.000Z	zemantic	djm62	hey good idea ;)
2005-04-26T14:27:00.000Z	djm62	zemantic	I'm not even sure how you'd go from there...install a minimal debian sarge, then add ubuntu sources to /etc/apt/sources.list
2005-04-26T14:27:00.000Z	zemantic	djm62	no way to tell grub to boot from usb? or some network?
2005-04-26T14:28:00.000Z	zemantic	djm62	or some program that just reboots your computer up to a certain image? that would be nice :/  i'm not magic enough to pull that kind of stuff
2005-04-26T14:28:00.000Z	djm62	zemantic	I'm not sure...grub is booted, so if the bios won't boot from usb, grub is unlikely to
2005-04-26T14:29:00.000Z	djm62	zemantic	 otoh, if you can get grub shell you can boot to anything
