2009-08-16T08:19:00.000Z	SJr		I tried switching to Kubuntu, but it seems like Gnome is still running, how can I just get rid of Gnome.
2009-08-16T08:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SJr	 how did you 'switch' ?
2009-08-16T08:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SJr	 at the Login screen (kdm or gdm) theres a 'session' menu - you select kde or gnome from there.
2009-08-16T08:22:00.000Z	SJr	Dr_Willis	 I did that, and I'm running KDE right now, but I noticed alot of apps still use Gnome settings, and My desktop is gnome
2009-08-16T08:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SJr	 that.. made no sence..  if you are running KDE then how id your desktop gnome?
2009-08-16T08:22:00.000Z	SJr	Dr_Willis	 I don't know
2009-08-16T08:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SJr	 you dident accidently run Nautilus some how did you?  that can goof things up.
2009-08-16T08:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SJr	 perhaps make a new user and login to kde with them.. see if it uses kde or not.
2009-08-16T08:23:00.000Z	SJr	Dr_Willis	 that could have happened at some point in the past, I Believe that some file associations were broken.
2009-08-16T08:24:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SJr	 ive seen that kde4 + gnome can cause some... issues if both used...
2009-08-16T08:24:00.000Z	SJr	Dr_Willis	 ah that was it, natalus was running
2009-08-16T08:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SJr	 i recall speciciaally last i tried kde + gnome and xfce that the 'default tool to open special locations' keep getting confused.
2009-08-16T08:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SJr	 gnome started launching the kde file manager,  or the xfce file manager for the gnome places -> whatever locations.
2009-08-16T08:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SJr	 then i fixed that.. kde started runnignthe gnome file manager for their special locations
2009-08-16T08:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SJr	 did they do somthing to improve kde lately?   last i tried it.. i couldent stand to use it. :) which is why im now using gnome.
2009-08-16T08:27:00.000Z	SJr	Dr_Willis	 it's gotten alot better since 4.0...
2009-08-16T08:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SJr	  i am constantly amazed at how all these 'new' innovations in gui 'research' and design.. really dont make things any easier.... :)
2012-06-11T19:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	SJr	 not at this time as far as i know of.
