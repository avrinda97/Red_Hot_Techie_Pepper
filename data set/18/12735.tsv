2007-01-11T07:08:00.000Z	Nintendud		I never want to use the ext3 filesystem again. I don't think any FS has an excuse for eating up 15 gigs for no reason at a random point in time.
2007-01-11T07:08:00.000Z	kitche	Nintendud	linux has 5% reserved for root
2007-01-11T07:08:00.000Z	Nintendud	kitche	I know this
2007-01-11T07:08:00.000Z	Nintendud	kitche	but, this 15 gig loss happened wayyyy after the format
2007-01-11T07:09:00.000Z	kitche	Nintendud	well don't blame it on a fs it's probably a program running on your computer or even lost+found is probably doing it
2007-01-11T07:10:00.000Z	Nintendud	kitche	lost+found is empty
2007-01-11T07:11:00.000Z	kitche	Nintendud	how big is your partition?
2007-01-11T07:11:00.000Z	Nintendud	kitche	it's a 300 gig drive.. let me see what that translates to...
2007-01-11T07:13:00.000Z	Nintendud	kitche	so, it's that size, it SHOULD have 24.9 gigs free, but it reads 10.9 ;p
2007-01-11T07:15:00.000Z	kitche	Nintendud	unless your logs are growing in size or it might be due to the packages see how much space that they take up
2007-01-11T07:16:00.000Z	Nintendud	kitche	hmm? packages? this isn't a root drive
2007-01-11T07:16:00.000Z	kitche	Nintendud	ah what is the drive for?
2007-01-11T07:17:00.000Z	Nintendud	kitche	downloads, basically.
2007-01-11T07:19:00.000Z	kitche	Nintendud	well I figured for 300 gig drive 15 gigs would go to root so I would say something you have might be using your space without you knowing it
2007-01-11T07:19:00.000Z	Nintendud	kitche	I don't see why it would suddenly, in one day, be like "boom. 15 gigs allocated to root"
2007-01-11T07:21:00.000Z	kitche	Nintendud	your not evben sure if it's ext3 it could be someone using your machine for soemthing
2007-01-11T07:21:00.000Z	Nintendud	kitche	no one is using my machine but me :)
2007-01-11T07:36:00.000Z	Nintendud	kitche	really? is it worse than NTFS? :P
