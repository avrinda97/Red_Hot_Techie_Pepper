2010-08-04T23:38:00.000Z	sikilpaake		i need somebody to test what happens when you boot ubuntu without a monitor.. i can't connect to remote desktop server running on a headless machine :(
2010-08-04T23:38:00.000Z	rallias	sikilpaake	what do you need to know/
2010-08-04T23:38:00.000Z	sikilpaake	rallias	well.. first off, thanks for tending to me
2010-08-04T23:39:00.000Z	sikilpaake	rallias	i start ubuntu headless.. and nmap tells me a machine is no
2010-08-04T23:39:00.000Z	sikilpaake	rallias	but.. i can't vnc into it
2010-08-04T23:39:00.000Z	sikilpaake	rallias	i've done this on other *another machine, and everything works
2010-08-04T23:39:00.000Z	rallias	sikilpaake	X won't run without a monitor, and no VNC server that I know of will run without X on ubuntu
2010-08-04T23:40:00.000Z	sikilpaake	rallias	i'm thinking about googling "running x without a monitor"
2010-08-04T23:40:00.000Z	sikilpaake	rallias	is that a good idea?
2010-08-04T23:41:00.000Z	rallias	sikilpaake	replace your xorg.conf file with a failsafe. That way, X will run along with any vnc file
2010-08-04T23:41:00.000Z	sikilpaake	rallias	thanks!!
2010-08-04T23:41:00.000Z	sikilpaake	rallias	wait, with a failsafe?
2010-08-04T23:42:00.000Z	rallias	sikilpaake	yes, that way it will start wether or not there is a monitor attached
2010-08-04T23:42:00.000Z	sikilpaake	rallias	you mean a failsafe xorg.conf? what do i do to make it failsafe?
2010-08-04T23:42:00.000Z	sikilpaake	rallias	gotcha!
2010-08-04T23:42:00.000Z	sikilpaake	rallias	thanks!!
2010-08-04T23:42:00.000Z	rallias	sikilpaake	no problem
2010-08-04T23:42:00.000Z	sikilpaake	rallias	you saved me many hours of headaches :)
