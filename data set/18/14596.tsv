2005-07-04T06:32:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	Wa77z	ESD will do that.  They're fixing it in breezy, but for now try changing its config like in the restricted formats faq
2005-07-04T06:35:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	Wa77z	we know that.  ESD kind of sucks
2005-07-04T06:36:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	Wa77z	Enlightenment Sound Daemon.  It will handle system sounds, but many applications wont play well with it, so you configure it to suspend ESD while running those applications.  But you can only run one of such applications with sound rights at a time
2005-07-04T06:36:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	Wa77z	did you configure ESD like it says in restricted formats?
2005-07-04T06:38:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	Wa77z	make /etc/esound/esd.conf look like this: https://wiki.ubuntu.com//RestrictedFormats#head-5bb92da29c02203193ac2fa6d2cfb90064959bec
2005-07-04T06:40:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	Wa77z	that is the exact path.  Go to the root directory and work up from there
2005-07-04T06:41:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	Wa77z	or you could open a terminal and type the name of an editing program and then that absolute filename path
2005-07-04T06:47:00.000Z	Wa77z	tiglionabbit	: i understand what i have to do..im just not sure what exactly the command is i am suppose to type in
2005-07-04T06:48:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	Wa77z	try saying "sudo gedit /etc/esound/esd.conf" at the terminal
2005-07-04T06:48:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	Wa77z	buttons?
2005-07-04T06:53:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	Wa77z	yes.  At a terminal, please say `sudo gedit /etc/esound/esd.conf` without those `s
2005-07-04T06:57:00.000Z	tiglionabbit	Wa77z	what page?
