2008-12-24T06:35:00.000Z	hashbrowns	trifecta	 I was following this guide here  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBootHowTo but i dont understand Restore the boot sector e.g. dd if=/media/hda/mbr.bin of=/dev/hda bs=512 count=1
2008-12-24T06:36:00.000Z	hashbrowns	trifecta	do you know anyone that is good with dualboot setups?
2008-12-24T06:37:00.000Z	hashbrowns	trifecta	Well I chose to set it up like this because of read/write performance OS on one HDD games on another and recorded footage on the thrid.
2008-12-24T06:39:00.000Z	hashbrowns	trifecta	do you know what "Restore the boot sector e.g. dd if=/media/hda/mbr.bin of=/dev/hda bs=512 count=1" means from that guide I linked you?
2008-12-24T06:39:00.000Z	hashbrowns	trifecta	how would I do that?
2008-12-24T06:40:00.000Z	hashbrowns	trifecta	okay.
