2008-03-14T07:53:00.000Z	Polishpaul		i'm trying to connect my laptop's external VGA to my monitor. When i enable the 2nd monitor in System > admin > screens & graphics, and manually look it up (model), it asks me for a driver?! Where do i get it? - - see, i don't wanna auto-detect my ext. monitor because it will eff-up my xorg.conf. I want to be able to have 2 monitors defined as clones. (poor man's docking station).
2008-03-14T07:53:00.000Z	Polishpaul		bluefox__ what kind of mobo? mem? be specific
2008-03-14T07:55:00.000Z	Polishpaul		it still asks for a driver
2008-03-14T07:56:00.000Z	bluefoxx__	Polishpaul	its a asus 1997 slot one p2b-f, capable of up to 1 gig, it has usually 256 in it in a comination of two matching 64 mb sticks and two other 64 mb sticks, i tried to swap the mis-matched ones for a pair of 64 sticks that match, but they limit it to 128 for some reason...
2008-03-14T07:59:00.000Z	Polishpaul	bluefoxx__	what slocket/slot is it?
2008-03-14T08:01:00.000Z	Polishpaul	bluefoxx__	i'd need to look up documentation on it. I'd try running mem test first! that usually catches bum slots or ram
2008-03-14T08:02:00.000Z	bluefoxx__	Polishpaul	slot 1, with a 450 mhz pentium3...i think its the ram i wanted to install though...i have 256 working in it now but two are mismatched...if i put even one of the 'new' sticks in with three other 64 m sticks it only showed 128 not 256...the ram in question seems to have a mitsubishi symbol on it. all the slots are good, and all my ram, except for the two 'new' sticks, which were salvaged from a old school computer...
2008-03-14T08:03:00.000Z	Polishpaul	bluefoxx__	perhaps the memory is still mismatched? how about ECC? buffered ram? etc etc maybe one pair has a difference
2008-03-14T08:03:00.000Z	Polishpaul	bluefoxx__	you'll want to find the numbers on the RAM stickers or chips and try googling for specs
2008-03-14T08:04:00.000Z	Polishpaul	bluefoxx__	this will usually reveal info such as if the ram is buffered, ECC or any other special types
2008-03-14T08:05:00.000Z	bluefoxx__	Polishpaul	idk really, im trying to boot a ubunut gutsy cd to install and then i can test it all out from an installed OS...its not currently attatched to a dedicated screen or in a case, instead its running out of a cardboard box and hooked up to the mon on my grandfathers pc i made him[i also grabbed the pair of 128 sticks out of it to install ubuntu]
2008-03-14T08:06:00.000Z	bluefoxx__	Polishpaul	arnt special types of ram usually keyed/notched differently?
2008-03-14T08:06:00.000Z	Polishpaul	bluefoxx__	not all, i'd suggest referrencing the #'s on the memory sticks..
2008-03-14T08:07:00.000Z	bluefoxx__	Polishpaul	wull do, as soon as i find them again...i have so many parts scattered on the floor right now its not funyn...and strangely theyr nostly NICs...NICs and EDO ram >>
2008-03-14T08:09:00.000Z	Polishpaul	bluefoxx__	build a router out of all those nics :) i've been cleaning my mess as well so i know whatcha mean :)
2008-03-14T08:10:00.000Z	bluefoxx__	Polishpaul	i actually am going to do that XD. the PC im building and trying to make work with this RAM is going to dual boot medibuntu and a custom build of linux im gonna make in the next two seeks[spring break w00t]
2008-03-14T08:15:00.000Z	bluefoxx__	Polishpaul	found the ram! stickers both say MH8V7245AWZJ-6 and the pcboard says PC168AJA-*  BE3-0    94V-0 then in a little box below that one says 41 and the other says 35. chips all say M5M465805AJ    752DA1A-6....spaces indicate the equivilant of a "return" or "enter"
