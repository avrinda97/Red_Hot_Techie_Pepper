2008-05-30T03:44:00.000Z	AcornAcorn		is it possible to autorun a cd in ubuntu if it has an autorun.inf file?
2008-05-30T03:44:00.000Z	AcornAcorn		or is that completely windows specific?
2008-05-30T03:44:00.000Z	neofax	AcornAcorn	Yes, you just need to set it up in your desktop
2008-05-30T03:45:00.000Z	AcornAcorn	neofax	should running the .inf file work?
2008-05-30T03:45:00.000Z	neofax	AcornAcorn	What desktop are you using Gnome or KDE?
2008-05-30T03:45:00.000Z	AcornAcorn	neofax	gnome
2008-05-30T03:46:00.000Z	AcornAcorn	neofax	if I run it it prompts me asking if i want to run it or view it but nothing happens when i run it
2008-05-30T03:47:00.000Z	neofax	AcornAcorn	In System go to Administration and there should be a setting to enable CD autorun.  I use KDE, so I will have to find it.
2008-05-30T03:47:00.000Z	neofax	AcornAcorn	What is on the CD?
2008-05-30T03:48:00.000Z	AcornAcorn	neofax	it's just opening a html file
2008-05-30T03:48:00.000Z	AcornAcorn	neofax	it would be nice if i could just run the mounted cd though
2008-05-30T03:49:00.000Z	AcornAcorn	neofax	like be able to rightclick>autorun
2008-05-30T03:50:00.000Z	neofax	AcornAcorn	Nautilus should show the contents of what is on the cd.  Also, you could try doing ls /media/cdrom in the terminal
2008-05-30T03:51:00.000Z	AcornAcorn	neofax	oh, i can browse the cd fine, i just meant it would be nice to be able to just autorun it rather than running the file
2008-05-30T03:52:00.000Z	neofax	AcornAcorn	I guess I misunderstood what you meant.  autorun a program is a windows thing, not linux.
2008-05-30T03:52:00.000Z	neofax	AcornAcorn	Linux can autorun mp3 cds, movie cds and such, but not say games.
2008-05-30T04:07:00.000Z	neofax	AcornAcorn	It may mean your /etc/mtab points to a different drive than your /etc/fstab
2008-05-30T04:09:00.000Z	AcornAcorn	neofax	oh, maybe rightclick>unmount has nothing to do with gmount-iso
