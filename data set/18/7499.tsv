2009-01-10T22:38:00.000Z	_Ben		its not a wireless card
2009-01-10T22:39:00.000Z	_Ben		ok...
2009-01-10T22:39:00.000Z	Lukasz	_Ben	It might be
2009-01-10T22:41:00.000Z	Lukasz	_Ben	Briefly, Ndiswrapper is a windows network driver, suited to work on Ubuntu
2009-01-10T22:55:00.000Z	Lukasz	_Ben	Have you tried blacklisting it in /etc/modprobe ?
2009-01-10T22:56:00.000Z	Lukasz	_Ben	Which file?
2009-01-10T23:35:00.000Z	Lukasz	_Ben	Before making a thread you could try to "ask" google about "the chipset name" + "your Ubuntu version"
2009-01-10T23:20:00.000Z	Lukasz	_Ben	Try, under root "ifconfig" to see if your kernel shows up any net devices
2009-01-10T23:29:00.000Z	Lukasz	_Ben	No, rather impossible.
2009-01-10T23:30:00.000Z	Lukasz	_Ben	Linux not supporting PCI devs
2009-01-10T23:31:00.000Z	Lukasz	_Ben	I'd consider creating a thread on http://ubuntuforums.org
2009-01-10T23:31:00.000Z	Lukasz	_Ben	I'm sorry, i can't help you with that, I'm not good at hardware, sorry.
2009-01-10T23:32:00.000Z	Lukasz	_Ben	Let's not make it too big :)
2009-01-10T23:34:00.000Z	Lukasz	_Ben	I'm sure some Ubuntu dev or just more experienced user will help yoo out with that
2009-01-10T23:35:00.000Z	Lukasz	_Ben	Well, I'm assuming you've done that already :)
