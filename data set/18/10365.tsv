2006-12-11T06:02:00.000Z	Olivia		Hey guys, I have a question
2006-12-11T06:03:00.000Z	adaptr	Olivia	don't keep us all in suspense!
2006-12-11T06:03:00.000Z	Olivia		I installed Ubuntu on another computer, and moved the hard drive over to a different machine. Now it can't mount the root file system.
2006-12-11T06:04:00.000Z	adaptr	Olivia	check hard drive connections, jumper settings, and BIOS settings
2006-12-11T06:05:00.000Z	Olivia	adaptr	I checked everything. It finds Ubuntu system, then timesout trying to get to the root file system and loads "BusyBox"
2006-12-11T06:05:00.000Z	adaptr	Olivia	what kind of hard disk is this on?
2006-12-11T06:05:00.000Z	Olivia		Maxtor 60GB
2006-12-11T06:05:00.000Z	Olivia		Hard drive
2006-12-11T06:06:00.000Z	adaptr	Olivia	by "what kind" I mean how is it connected to the PC ?
2006-12-11T06:06:00.000Z	Olivia	adaptr	IDE
2006-12-11T06:06:00.000Z	adaptr	Olivia	and you have connected it in exactly the same way as in the other PC ?
2006-12-11T06:07:00.000Z	Olivia	adaptr	Yes, and it was working on that one. It points to the location /dev/hdc1 I think.
2006-12-11T06:07:00.000Z	Olivia	adaptr	Is there a way using busybox that I can check what folder the hdd is mounted to?
2006-12-11T06:08:00.000Z	adaptr	Olivia	then your boot files are on this drive, but the system is not.. your system cannot boot from hdc
2006-12-11T06:09:00.000Z	adaptr	Olivia	folders are not relevant at this point.. you have now already mentioned two different physical hard drives, none of which can boot a PC system
2006-12-11T06:09:00.000Z	Olivia	adaptr	Well, I only had one hard drive on the other computer. And they were all on that disk.
2006-12-11T06:10:00.000Z	adaptr	Olivia	then grub has probably screwed something up.. you need to look at your grub config
2006-12-11T06:11:00.000Z	Olivia	adaptr	How do I look at the grub file?
