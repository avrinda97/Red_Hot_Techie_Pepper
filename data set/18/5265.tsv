2008-11-18T06:07:00.000Z	SilentDis	apeiron	1 moment, yes i have, let me grab the error again
2008-11-18T06:14:00.000Z	apeiron	SilentDis	That's for the Windows side?
2008-11-18T06:15:00.000Z	SilentDis	apeiron	yeah, apparently they throw it into hidden.  windows ignores it and just reads it anyway, whereas mac (and linux) respect the flag lol
2008-11-18T06:15:00.000Z	apeiron	SilentDis	heh
2008-11-18T06:18:00.000Z	apeiron	SilentDis	What're you doing anyway, running it under Linux?
2008-11-18T06:18:00.000Z	SilentDis	apeiron	oh yes.  WoW runs AWESOME under linux
2008-11-18T06:19:00.000Z	apeiron	SilentDis	Interesting.
2008-11-18T06:19:00.000Z	apeiron	SilentDis	I've got a Mac so I can just run it there, but good to know. :)
2008-11-18T06:19:00.000Z	SilentDis	apeiron	3/4 the hardware spec of my friend, and i rarely if ever drop below 35fps, he's hovering around 20fps and has longer load times on his vista box.  *snicker*
2008-11-18T06:20:00.000Z	SilentDis	apeiron	I keep telling him "come to the dark side, we have cookies!" but he won't listen >.<
2008-11-18T06:20:00.000Z	apeiron	SilentDis	Eh, not everyone can switch.
2008-11-18T06:20:00.000Z	apeiron	SilentDis	Sometimes there're programs that don't run so well under Linux.
2008-11-18T06:21:00.000Z	SilentDis	apeiron	he plays wow, and does the basic e-mail, websurfing work.  little bit of photoshop.  photoshop is glorious under wine.
2008-11-18T06:21:00.000Z	apeiron	SilentDis	Or he could just use GIMP... <_<
2008-11-18T06:22:00.000Z	SilentDis	apeiron	exactly.  but even if he insists, he can keep it, that's the kicker
2008-11-18T06:22:00.000Z	SilentDis	apeiron	it's actually a joy to walk into best buy, hang around at the anti-virus isle, and when they ask, pull the XKCD suggestion and say "I run linux" and take off :D
2008-11-18T06:23:00.000Z	apeiron	SilentDis	tee hee
