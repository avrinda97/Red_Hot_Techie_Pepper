2010-07-02T17:06:00.000Z	daniel		I gonna install gdesklets or something
2010-07-02T17:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	daniel	 google has their applets also that i find handier then gdesklets
2010-07-02T17:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	daniel	 check dmesg output when it stops. could be Pulse crashing, or some driver issues
2011-01-31T17:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	daniel	 if its one of those mac-theme fancy scripts.. they often have an uninstall script.. but last i checked. some of those dident work very well.
2011-01-31T17:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	daniel	 go find its homepage and read its docs.guides for starters
2011-01-31T17:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	daniel	 we cant really help with such things.. if the script is broken - its broken.
2011-01-31T17:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	daniel	 the posts on that site. or the programs forums Might have some help
2011-09-04T08:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	daniel	 trying to gain extra speed? or just have one as a fallback?
2011-09-04T08:40:00.000Z	daniel	Dr_Willis	I have a network with other pcs, printer, etc so I just want to be able to use both network cards at the same time
2011-09-04T08:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	daniel	 i think you need to clarify your network layout and what you want to acomplish a bit more..
2011-09-04T08:46:00.000Z	daniel	Dr_Willis	I just want to setup a network to share information across my PCs and have a printer attached to the network as well. all my devices are far from the router and cabling to add internet to my LAN is very expensive for me. I do not need access to internet on the LAN since my PCs have a wireless card...
2011-09-04T10:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	daniel	 just plug them in.. they are networked....
2011-09-04T10:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	daniel	 you will want one dhcp server on the home network  I imagine. or a router to handle it.
2011-09-04T10:00:00.000Z	daniel	Dr_Willis	I think so... how can I do it?
2011-09-04T10:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	daniel	 do what? Plug them in? get router.. plug in cables...
2011-09-04T10:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	daniel	 theres dozens of 'networking for beginner' sites out there..   you allready have been told the basics.
