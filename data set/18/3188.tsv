2010-03-16T12:36:00.000Z	sje46		that what I'm looking for?
2010-03-16T12:37:00.000Z	sje46		@ the admin
2010-03-16T12:37:00.000Z	wgrant	sje46	Yes, but that's fine. You're behind a router of some kind that is doing NAT?
2010-03-16T12:37:00.000Z	sje46	wgrant	not sure what NAT is
2010-03-16T12:37:00.000Z	wgrant	sje46	Are you behind a home router?
2010-03-16T12:37:00.000Z	sje46	wgrant	yes
2010-03-16T12:38:00.000Z	wgrant	sje46	You'll need to check your router's manual for instructions on how to forward port 80 from the Internet to your computer.
2010-03-16T12:38:00.000Z	wgrant	sje46	Also keep in mind that some Internet service providers block port 80 to stop you from doing that.
2010-03-16T12:39:00.000Z	sje46	wgrant	this is going to sound dumb...but if port 80 is for http, if it's blocked, how can I go on the web?
2010-03-16T12:39:00.000Z	wgrant	sje46	They block it incoming, not outgoing.
2010-03-16T12:43:00.000Z	sje46	wgrant	forwarding port 80 worked for http...but I have 6662 till 6669 open for IRC, but that isn't working for my IRCd
2010-03-16T12:44:00.000Z	wgrant	sje46	check around to see if your ISP blocks any incoming ports.
2010-03-16T12:45:00.000Z	sje46	wgrant	how do I do that?
2010-03-16T12:45:00.000Z	wgrant	sje46	Check their website, and otherwise search the Internet.
2010-03-16T12:49:00.000Z	sje46	wgrant	it doesn't appear as though comcast is blockin 6667
2010-03-16T12:53:00.000Z	sje46	wgrant	I have port 6667 forwarded, but it's under TCP.UDP.  Is that correct?  I'm not even sure what that means
2010-03-16T12:53:00.000Z	wgrant	sje46	TCP is the important one, but UDP won't hurt.
