2006-09-07T06:32:00.000Z	azureal		hi, if i wanted to reemove a kernel, would i just remove the appropriate directories in /usr/src and edit /boot/grub/menu.lst?
2006-09-07T06:32:00.000Z	chuckyp	azureal	you could remove the package
2006-09-07T06:33:00.000Z	azureal	chuckyp	nope; manual install
2006-09-07T06:33:00.000Z	chuckyp	azureal	sudo apt-get remove linux-image-2.6.15-whatever
2006-09-07T06:33:00.000Z	chuckyp	azureal	ahh well thats a different story
2006-09-07T06:33:00.000Z	azureal	chuckyp	just tell me if what i said works
2006-09-07T06:34:00.000Z	chuckyp	azureal	I'm not sure but I believe it would keep files else where.
2006-09-07T06:34:00.000Z	chuckyp	azureal	If you aren't really concerned abou tthe 20megs. just remove its entry from menu.1st
2006-09-07T06:35:00.000Z	azureal	chuckyp	i'd just like to install it again from scratch
2006-09-07T06:37:00.000Z	azureal	chuckyp	i'm removing the relative files in /usr/src, /lib/modules, and /lib/firmware
2006-09-07T06:38:00.000Z	chuckyp	azureal	before you do that just make sure you are in a different kernel
2006-09-07T06:38:00.000Z	azureal	chuckyp	of course ;)
2006-09-07T06:38:00.000Z	chuckyp	azureal	there is a image file as well somewhere reference the menu.1st for it.
2006-09-07T06:38:00.000Z	chuckyp	azureal	make sure its not a common image file that the other kernels aren't using.
2006-10-28T07:40:00.000Z	chuckyp	azureal	did you use checkinstall and make a deb?
2006-10-28T07:40:00.000Z	azureal	chuckyp	no, i'm not familiar with this procedure...
2006-10-28T07:52:00.000Z	chuckyp	azureal	^^^^^^
2006-10-28T07:56:00.000Z	chuckyp	azureal	when I installed mplayer from source in dapper I created a deb.   However, now i just use the one from the repos.
