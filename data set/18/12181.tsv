2006-05-16T14:24:00.000Z	tla		can anybody help with sharing?
2006-05-16T14:24:00.000Z	tla		(windows sharing)
2006-05-16T14:24:00.000Z	Samuli^	tla	what do you want to know?
2006-05-16T14:25:00.000Z	tla		I setup the share in the ubuntu machine but I can't access it from the windows machine
2006-05-16T14:25:00.000Z	Samuli^	tla	uhh.. is it samba or nfs?
2006-05-16T14:25:00.000Z	tla		samba
2006-05-16T14:25:00.000Z	Samuli^	tla	I managed to get that working by reading the samba-manuals.
2006-05-16T14:26:00.000Z	Samuli^		it isn't really that hard.
2006-05-16T14:26:00.000Z	Samuli^	tla	did you do the sharing via nautilus or with terminal?
2006-05-16T14:26:00.000Z	tla	Samuli^	with nautilus
2006-05-16T14:27:00.000Z	tla	Samuli^	it appears in the System>Administartion>Shared Folders
2006-05-16T14:27:00.000Z	Samuli^	tla	the basic thing is that you need to have the same workgroup and I think ip's that are the same beside the last three digits.
2006-05-16T14:27:00.000Z	tla	Samuli^	the problem is that i can't seem to login
2006-05-16T14:28:00.000Z	tla	Samuli^	it is the same subnet, and the same workgroup
2006-05-16T14:28:00.000Z	Samuli^		ahh.. you might have different login 'stuff' in the samba.. you really should read samba documentation on the internet somewhere.
2006-05-16T14:28:00.000Z	tla	Samuli^	I'll try, thx
2006-05-16T14:28:00.000Z	Samuli^		I can't remember how I managed to get it work, but I just needed to read some documentaries.
2006-05-16T14:29:00.000Z	Samuli^	tla	try searching for something like windows linux samba sharing or something.
