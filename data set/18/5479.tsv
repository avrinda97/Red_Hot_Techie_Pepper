2008-10-20T11:34:00.000Z	Kartagis		hi
2008-10-20T11:35:00.000Z	Kartagis		has anyone tried wakeonlan lately and verified that it's actually working? because it's not working for me
2008-10-20T11:35:00.000Z	traxx	Kartagis	works for me
2008-10-20T11:38:00.000Z	Kartagis	traxx	I first thought it could be because of network and isolated it, tried it and it didn't work
2008-10-20T11:39:00.000Z	traxx	Kartagis	how are you using it?
2008-10-20T11:40:00.000Z	Kartagis	traxx	wakeonlan -i ip macaddress
2008-10-20T11:40:00.000Z	traxx	Kartagis	``ip'' meaning what?
2008-10-20T11:40:00.000Z	traxx	Kartagis	-i should have the broadcast as argument
2008-10-20T11:40:00.000Z	Kartagis	traxx	IP address of the PC
2008-10-20T11:41:00.000Z	traxx	Kartagis	try '-i <broadcast>' instead
2008-10-20T11:42:00.000Z	Kartagis	traxx	man wakeonlan says Destination IP address. Unless you have static ARP tables you should use some kind of broadcast address I have it fixed
2008-10-20T11:42:00.000Z	traxx	Kartagis	i always use the broadcast address and it works with that
2008-10-20T11:44:00.000Z	Kartagis	traxx	let me try that
2008-10-20T11:47:00.000Z	Kartagis	traxx	I tried with broadcast IP too
2008-10-20T11:50:00.000Z	traxx	Kartagis	did that help?
2008-10-20T11:51:00.000Z	Kartagis	traxx	no :( in my previous installation it used to work (gentoo),
2008-10-20T11:51:00.000Z	traxx	Kartagis	so it's an ubuntu box that's not waking up or not doing the wake up?
2008-10-20T11:52:00.000Z	Kartagis	traxx	exactly. i will now install gentoo in a vmware environment and try again
