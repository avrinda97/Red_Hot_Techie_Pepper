2011-03-31T20:50:00.000Z	extraymond		Excuse me~ Does anybody know how to install Luxrender for Blender2.56 under Ubuntu 10.10?
2011-03-31T20:50:00.000Z	extraymond		I can't get it done.
2011-03-31T20:51:00.000Z	ayecee	extraymond	what happens when you try?
2011-03-31T21:00:00.000Z	extraymond		ayecee:I donwload Luxrender and press install add-on in Blender
2011-03-31T21:00:00.000Z	extraymond		ayecee:But Nothing happened
2011-03-31T21:01:00.000Z	ayecee	extraymond	the button just popped up again as if you had not clicked it?
2011-03-31T21:02:00.000Z	extraymond		ayecee:I'm using Blender 2.56 from ppa irie
2011-03-31T21:02:00.000Z	ayecee	extraymond	is that a yes or no to my question?
2011-03-31T21:03:00.000Z	extraymond	ayecee	which button?
2011-03-31T21:04:00.000Z	ayecee	extraymond	you said you pressed install. That's not a button?
2011-03-31T21:06:00.000Z	ayecee	extraymond	You may have to follow the manual installation steps if the graphical install addon doesn't work. Looks like instructions are here: http://www.luxrender.net/wiki/LuxBlend_2.5_installation_instructions
2011-03-31T21:08:00.000Z	extraymond		ayecee:I'm going to try again.
2011-03-31T21:08:00.000Z	ayecee		ok
2011-03-31T21:13:00.000Z	extraymond	ayecee	I follow the instruction. But can't get it to work. A Luxrender add-on should be there for enabling it.
2011-03-31T21:14:00.000Z	extraymond	ayecee	But I can only see a render_netrender which has a exclamation mark.
2011-03-31T21:15:00.000Z	ayecee	extraymond	I don't know this software well enough to suggest a fix. Is there perhaps a more blender-specific channel?
2011-03-31T21:16:00.000Z	extraymond		Thanks for your help~ I'm gonna check it.
2011-03-31T21:16:00.000Z	ayecee	extraymond	it looks like #blender is the official one
