2009-06-24T09:04:00.000Z	admin__	msl	thanks
2009-06-24T09:04:00.000Z	msl	admin__	Success?
2009-06-24T08:54:00.000Z	msl	admin__	Does gparted format drives?  It may only partition the drive and set the partitions system id (which tells it the filesystem to expect)
2009-06-24T08:55:00.000Z	admin__	msl	I was told that it did.  I need to format a Portable HDD to FAT32. other ideas?
2009-06-24T08:56:00.000Z	msl	admin__	I would do it manually:  mkfs.vfat  /dev/sdX#
2009-06-24T08:58:00.000Z	msl	admin__	Be sure to use mkfs.vfat.  fsck.vfat is a filesystem check, not formatting the partition...
2009-06-24T08:59:00.000Z	admin__	msl	well i'm not trying to format a partition but an entire portable HDD
2009-06-24T08:59:00.000Z	msl	admin__	Well, it will be one big partition.
2009-06-24T09:02:00.000Z	admin__	msl	so "mkfs.vfat /dev/sdb"  ?
2009-06-24T09:03:00.000Z	msl	admin__	You probably can't format the device.  You will need to format the partition:  mkfs.vfat /dev/sdb1
2009-06-24T09:04:00.000Z	admin__	msl	maybe, we'll see, gonna plug into mac
2009-06-24T09:05:00.000Z	msl	admin__	They are highlighted when they have your nickname (admin__) in them.  :)
2009-06-24T09:06:00.000Z	msl	admin__	Yes.  You don't need the parentheses though.
2009-06-24T09:07:00.000Z	admin__	msl	oh nice
2009-06-24T09:10:00.000Z	admin__	msl	well I'm not sure If it worked perfectly, it took windows a long time to recognize the drive was connected to my computer, but otherwise it worked! Awesome
2009-06-24T09:12:00.000Z	msl	admin__	Yes
2009-06-24T09:12:00.000Z	admin__	msl	well you all freakin rock, never have I had help so quickly, and I've been here before, got stuff done right fast.  don't know if i'll fully convert to linux, so daunting
2009-06-24T09:13:00.000Z	msl	admin__	It takes a bit of curiosity, but once you get used to the power, you won't want to go back.  :)
