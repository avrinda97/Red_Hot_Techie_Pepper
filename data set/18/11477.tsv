2009-07-29T09:16:00.000Z	mikebot	sebsebseb	Thanks.. could this be why it works in ubuntu (I can write to it), but I can only read to it on a mac?
2009-07-29T09:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mikebot	on your Mac do you mean with Mac OS X,  or you got Ubuntu on there as well?
2009-07-29T09:17:00.000Z	mikebot	sebsebseb	os x, sorry
2009-07-29T09:18:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mikebot	which file system is the external drive?
2009-07-29T09:19:00.000Z	mikebot	sebsebseb	/dev/sdb1
2009-07-29T09:22:00.000Z	mikebot	sebsebseb	any ideas?
2009-07-29T09:34:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mikebot	your issue is probably with Mac OS X, so try #mac
2009-07-29T09:34:00.000Z	mikebot	sebsebseb	it doesn't have to do with permissions?
2009-07-29T09:34:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mikebot	permissions are for OS's not external hard disks
2009-07-29T09:35:00.000Z	mikebot	sebsebseb	Ah, OK. Thanks
2009-07-29T09:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mikebot	then OS's such as Ubuntu will give permissions to things
2009-07-29T09:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mikebot	it's ##mac by the way
2009-07-29T09:35:00.000Z	mikebot	sebsebseb	K, well, thanks then.
2009-07-29T09:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mikebot	np good luck
2011-04-28T22:57:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mikebot	there isn't one anymore, because Unity is now for both netbooks and Desktop
2011-04-28T22:57:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mikebot	however Unity should be able to detect when it's running on a netbook or desktop, and then be slightly differnet as well
