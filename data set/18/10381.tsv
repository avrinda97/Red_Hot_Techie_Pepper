2009-09-19T18:15:00.000Z	echosystm		is it just me or are fonts massive in ubuntu?
2009-09-19T18:16:00.000Z	echosystm		firefox locks its dpi at 96, but the fonts are noticeably larger than in windows :/
2009-09-19T18:16:00.000Z	echosystm		i mean, to the point that some html layouts on websites are messed up because the fonts are too big
2009-09-19T18:16:00.000Z	LjL	echosystm	uh, firefox locks the font size?
2009-09-19T18:17:00.000Z	echosystm	LjL	regardless of what DPI your desktop is using, firefox still uses 96
2009-09-19T18:17:00.000Z	echosystm		afaik
2009-09-19T18:17:00.000Z	LjL	echosystm	i didn't know. i could possibly tell you how to force some DPI if they're not being detected right for your monitor, but if firefox locks that and it still isn't right, i don't know.
2009-09-19T18:17:00.000Z	echosystm		there is a way to change firefox's default DPI
2009-09-19T18:18:00.000Z	echosystm		i was just wondering why this happens at all
2009-09-19T18:18:00.000Z	echosystm		all text is much bigger here
2009-09-19T18:18:00.000Z	echosystm		on my laptop and my desktop
2009-09-19T18:19:00.000Z	LjL	echosystm	in general, it *may* be expected for fonts to be bigger: while windows locks the fonts at whatever DPI, ubuntu just tries to detect the correct DPI for your monitor
2009-09-19T18:20:00.000Z	LjL	echosystm	that's enough to make it different from windows... and then, if your monitor happens to be silly and cause them to be detected *wrong*, it's even more noticeable ;)
2009-09-19T18:20:00.000Z	echosystm		let me put it this wya
2009-09-19T18:20:00.000Z	echosystm		if irun windows in a vm
2009-09-19T18:20:00.000Z	echosystm		under linux
2009-09-19T18:20:00.000Z	echosystm		the fonts are still bigger
2009-09-19T18:21:00.000Z	LjL	echosystm	that's just not possible, unless you're using a different *resolution* than the one you're using in windows!
