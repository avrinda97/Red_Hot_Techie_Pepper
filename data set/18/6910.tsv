2008-03-10T16:45:00.000Z	Laughed		oh, well what would linux users use to manage their media library
2008-03-10T16:45:00.000Z	Laughed		all in one place (like Zune, and Itunes)
2008-03-10T16:45:00.000Z	Laughed		nice
2008-03-10T16:45:00.000Z	Laughed		I would want something to manage all media (pics, music, movies)
2008-03-10T16:46:00.000Z	apo	Laughed	Dunno, there's a bunch of software that can talk to iPods. Rhythmbox, I think.
2008-03-10T16:46:00.000Z	apo	Laughed	Or gpixpod, that seems to be able to handle your photos.
2008-03-10T16:47:00.000Z	apo	Laughed	Just do a search for ipod in synaptic and choose what you want.
