2006-08-30T06:25:00.000Z	jmhodges		ok, i've tried debugging myself, and i've checked the wiki
2006-08-30T06:26:00.000Z	jmhodges		but for the life of me, i can't figure out why my SBLive card is recognized, but refuses to play any audio
2006-08-30T06:26:00.000Z	jmhodges		i went through alsamixer and everything
2006-08-30T06:26:00.000Z	jmhodges		i'm totally confused
2006-08-30T06:26:00.000Z	Huck	jmhodges	do you have more than one soundcard?
2006-08-30T06:27:00.000Z	jmhodges	Huck	apparently, its seeing three1
2006-08-30T06:27:00.000Z	jmhodges	Huck	but sblive is showing to aplay as snd card 0
2006-08-30T06:27:00.000Z	Huck	jmhodges	can you disable onboard sound thorugh your mobo?
2006-08-30T06:27:00.000Z	jmhodges	Huck	erm, thats a good question
2006-08-30T06:27:00.000Z	Huck	jmhodges	hang on a sec, I just wenth thorugh something similar myself.
2006-08-30T06:27:00.000Z	jmhodges	Huck	cool, thanks
2006-08-30T06:32:00.000Z	Huck	jmhodges	go here http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=205449&highlight=sound+driver+order  and look for this: Configuring default soundcards / stopping multiple soundcards from switching
2006-08-30T06:32:00.000Z	jmhodges	Huck	ahhhh.. hmmm
2006-08-30T06:32:00.000Z	Huck	jmhodges	it makes sure that the right driver loads first, so you can specify which soundcard runs at boot... worked for me
2006-08-30T06:33:00.000Z	jmhodges	Huck	cool, i'll make sure this is all good
2006-08-30T06:33:00.000Z	jmhodges	Huck	thanks1
