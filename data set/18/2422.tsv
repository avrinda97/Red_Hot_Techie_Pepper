2010-10-17T23:42:00.000Z	Xaifas		I got a problem with my internet connection on ubuntu. For some reason, anything that I do and requires to send/recieve data is very very slow. If i try to access a site has 10secish delay then goes full speed. If i try to ssh, halts for 10secs or so then finaly starts. Anyone who can explain what is causing this?
2010-10-17T23:42:00.000Z	k-rad	Xaifas	might be a dns problem check /etc/resolv.conf
2010-10-17T23:45:00.000Z	Xaifas	k-rad	 http://pastebin.ca/1965053 here is the link
2010-10-17T23:48:00.000Z	k-rad	Xaifas	i forgot the question
2010-10-17T23:48:00.000Z	Xaifas	k-rad	http://pastebin.ca/1965053 told me to paste resolv.conf
2010-10-17T23:49:00.000Z	k-rad	Xaifas	i may not have the networking expertise you do, however, i've never seen anything like it
2010-10-17T23:50:00.000Z	k-rad	Xaifas	the 192.168.1.254 is the ip of your internet connection device, that should not be necessary, are you using a router ?  or direct connection ?
2010-10-17T23:51:00.000Z	k-rad	Xaifas	oh.  do you have working internet at the moment ?
2010-10-17T23:51:00.000Z	k-rad	Xaifas	good.  and your preference for wifi manager is network-manager-gnome ?
2010-10-17T23:52:00.000Z	k-rad	Xaifas	who setup that /etc/resolv.conf in the first place
2010-10-17T23:52:00.000Z	Xaifas	k-rad	 no one, was there by default
2010-10-17T23:54:00.000Z	k-rad	Xaifas	make a backup of that file change nameservers to 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 two lines, then go to a terminal and do sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart.  then use your wifi manager to reconnect and see if that fixes your problem in your wifi manager
2010-10-18T00:00:00.000Z	Xaifas	k-rad	changed the file and did what you said. didnt worked. same thing
2010-10-18T00:00:00.000Z	k-rad	Xaifas	thank god your still here, then restore the old one, and learn your router i can only give you examples of my /etc/network/interfaces and my /etc/resolv.conf for you to learn
2010-10-18T00:01:00.000Z	k-rad	Xaifas	make note of what your router calls specific things by ip address
2010-10-18T00:27:00.000Z	Xaifas	k-rad	 booted to windows and changed the dns server and its the same as in resolv.conf file from ubuntu, so definetly not that. Still can't figure whats causing to be so damn slow
2010-10-18T00:28:00.000Z	k-rad	Xaifas	was it a utility that setup your network settings in windows ?
2010-10-18T00:29:00.000Z	k-rad	Xaifas	then that question and the answer i gave, ask in #networking and be real patient and kind when asking for help
