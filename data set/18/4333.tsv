2009-04-25T22:14:00.000Z	keonne		Hello
2009-04-25T22:15:00.000Z	keonne		Im trying to do a clean install over my xubuntu 8.04 of Ubuntu 9.04. when I try to install it fails to launch the GUI and goes into the command line.
2009-04-25T22:15:00.000Z	keonne		 I know the CD works because I used it just before on another computer
2009-04-25T22:16:00.000Z	keonne		is there a way to install 9.04 through the command line?
2009-04-25T22:16:00.000Z	pronoy_	keonne	booting from a disk ?
2009-04-25T22:16:00.000Z	keonne	pronoy_	yes
2009-04-25T22:16:00.000Z	pronoy_	keonne	its not a RC is it ?
2009-04-25T22:18:00.000Z	pronoy_	keonne	hang on
2009-04-25T22:18:00.000Z	keonne	pronoy_	i dont understand why the GUI fails to load and it falls back to command line...
2009-04-25T22:18:00.000Z	keonne	pronoy_	basically the install screen comes up and i can select to install 9.04 but it dosent get much further after that
2009-04-25T22:19:00.000Z	pronoy_	keonne	why don't you go for an upgrade ?
2009-04-25T22:19:00.000Z	keonne	pronoy_	I have Xubuntu 8.04
2009-04-25T22:19:00.000Z	pronoy_	keonne	so ??
2009-04-25T22:19:00.000Z	keonne	pronoy_	and I was hoping to do a clean install...
2009-04-25T22:20:00.000Z	keonne	pronoy_	but i am open to upgrading?
2009-04-25T22:20:00.000Z	pronoy_	keonne	hmm....i'll check for the clean install using command line....for upgrading check the channel topic
2009-04-25T22:24:00.000Z	keonne	pronoy_	im just going to upgrade for simplicity sake
