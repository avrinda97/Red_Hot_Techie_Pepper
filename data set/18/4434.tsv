2009-09-03T13:40:00.000Z	nubfilter		any oracle buffs in here?
2009-09-03T13:41:00.000Z	foxbuntu	nubfilter	I bet you would have great luck with that in #oracle
2009-09-03T13:42:00.000Z	foxbuntu	nubfilter	whats the got to do with oracle?
2009-09-03T13:42:00.000Z	foxbuntu	nubfilter	please direct to my name so I can read your replys
2009-09-03T13:43:00.000Z	foxbuntu	nubfilter	depends how hard the oracle DB will be used...
2009-09-03T13:43:00.000Z	foxbuntu	nubfilter	I would say it should be fine
2009-09-03T13:44:00.000Z	foxbuntu	nubfilter	I will say this...Oracle is resource hungry, it likes to eat up and hold onto system resources
2009-09-03T13:46:00.000Z	foxbuntu	nubfilter	just be warned and give the guest a pretty good chunk of memory to use if you can or it will crawl too, and when oracle crawls it rejects queries
2009-09-03T13:48:00.000Z	foxbuntu	nubfilter	why do you need to use oracle?
2009-09-03T13:48:00.000Z	foxbuntu	nubfilter	ah...some predefined requirement
2009-09-03T13:49:00.000Z	nubfilter	foxbuntu	yes it's incredibly fast...  I just wish that pgsql had a RAC equivilent
2009-09-03T13:50:00.000Z	foxbuntu	nubfilter	when it works as its supposed to, yes it is quite fast...but very temperamental (at least in my experience)
2009-09-03T13:52:00.000Z	nubfilter	foxbuntu	yes it is, but for 10TB databases with HA requirements it's pretty much Oracle or DB2
2009-09-03T13:52:00.000Z	foxbuntu	nubfilter	yes, or 4x the size for a MS SQL cluster
2009-09-03T13:55:00.000Z	foxbuntu	nubfilter	agreed...its great for small apps and web content, its awesome for things like that, but you get out there in big boy land with oracle and DB2 and forget it
2009-09-03T13:56:00.000Z	foxbuntu	nubfilter	I do app support and code support for a custom app to store images in a repo as we handle 3.5mil pages of paper converted to image per day
2009-09-03T13:56:00.000Z	foxbuntu	nubfilter	thats all on oracle
2009-09-03T13:57:00.000Z	foxbuntu	nubfilter	the image pointers are in oracle...lol, we would destroy the DB if we did blobs
