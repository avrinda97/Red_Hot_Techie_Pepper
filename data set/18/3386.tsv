2010-04-25T21:13:00.000Z	tvw		I want to setup some vhosts for apache. Now I wonder where to put the documentroot. /var/www already is a document root for default.
2010-04-25T21:15:00.000Z	Sia-	tvw	use sites-available + ln -s
2010-04-25T21:18:00.000Z	tvw	Sia-	there is no directory sites-available in /var
2010-04-25T21:21:00.000Z	Sia-	tvw	is in /etc/apache2
2010-04-25T21:21:00.000Z	Sia-	tvw	use find
2010-04-25T21:21:00.000Z	tvw	Sia-	that is the config dir, I already found it. I was asking, where to put the documentroot.
2010-04-25T21:22:00.000Z	Sia-	tvw	sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/default
2010-04-25T21:23:00.000Z	tvw	Sia-	That tells me, that the document root for the default site is /var/www. What I want to know is, where to put the document root for new vhosts. Is there a recommended place?
2010-04-25T21:24:00.000Z	Sia-	tvw	create new vhost for example /etc/apache2/sites-available/www.tvw.com
2010-04-25T21:25:00.000Z	tvw	Sia-	There is a difference between a config file and where the html-files finally go: the latter one is the document root.
2010-04-25T21:25:00.000Z	Sia-	tvw	ican√∏t understand what you want actually
2010-04-25T21:27:00.000Z	tvw	Sia-	the documentroot for default is /var/www. What would be the documentroot for a new vhost which has its own documentroot?
2010-04-25T21:27:00.000Z	Sia-	tvw	/var/www/mysites or blabla
2010-04-25T21:28:00.000Z	tvw	Sia-	/var/www/mysites will be in the document root of default, so this cannot be the solution.
2010-04-25T21:29:00.000Z	Sia-	tvw	point docoroot to any folder you want
2010-04-25T21:30:00.000Z	tvw	Sia-	OK, there is no recommended place. Since the config files had a sophisticated layout, I expected the same for where to put document root.
2010-04-25T21:30:00.000Z	tvw	Sia-	Thanks anyway.
2010-04-25T21:32:00.000Z	Sia-	tvw	vhost can create 100000 vhost, just point the docroot to the directory you want, for example mysite is desian.dk pointed to my /home/sia/desian.public/
