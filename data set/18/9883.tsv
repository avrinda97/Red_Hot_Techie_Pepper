2007-02-07T08:56:00.000Z	farski		can someone point me in the right direction as far as setting up software raid goes?
2007-02-07T08:58:00.000Z	mshade	farski	there's a great tutorial at tldp.org
2007-02-07T08:59:00.000Z	mshade	farski	i've used it to set up software raid 1 on slackware
2007-02-07T08:59:00.000Z	mshade		anyone know about knetworkmanager?
2007-02-07T08:59:00.000Z	farski	mshade	I can do this after I've installed the OS right? (the boot volume won't be in the raid)
2007-02-07T08:59:00.000Z	mshade	farski	yeah, absolutely
2007-02-07T09:02:00.000Z	farski	mshade	do you happen to know, if I set up a 2 drive array w/ software raid, and someday I switch to hardware, is that possible, or do they work completely differently
2007-02-07T09:03:00.000Z	mshade	farski	not sure about that.  it would probably depend on the card
2007-02-07T09:03:00.000Z	mshade	farski	but under software raid, each disk is identical -- take one away and mount it normally, it'll work fine
2007-02-07T09:03:00.000Z	mshade		anyone work with knetworkmanager
2007-02-07T09:03:00.000Z	mshade		?
2007-02-07T09:03:00.000Z	farski		k cool
2007-02-07T09:04:00.000Z	farski	mshade	can I set up the raid after one disk already has data on it?
2007-02-07T09:04:00.000Z	mshade	farski	yes
2007-02-07T09:04:00.000Z	farski	mshade	nice
2007-02-07T09:04:00.000Z	mshade	farski	just be sure which drive is used to build the raid from
2007-02-07T09:04:00.000Z	mshade	farski	because it's possible to synch the blank drive to the full drive
2007-02-07T09:05:00.000Z	farski	mshade	yep
