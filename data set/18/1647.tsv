2011-01-01T22:54:00.000Z	shcherbak	TyrantElf	connect, start system, check available setting (resolution  etc)
2011-01-01T22:55:00.000Z	shcherbak	TyrantElf	do you have ati diver or open?
2011-01-01T22:55:00.000Z	TyrantElf	shcherbak	I have checked what both say, but my 22" led tv that I want to hook up with hdmi is shown as a 7"
2011-01-01T22:56:00.000Z	shcherbak	TyrantElf	not screen size, resolution like 1600X900
2011-01-01T22:58:00.000Z	shcherbak	TyrantElf	with open drivers it is going to be... is randr working with your card?
2011-01-01T22:58:00.000Z	TyrantElf	shcherbak	The resolutions on the hdmi go up tp 1080p and the VGA goes up to 1020*768.
2011-01-01T23:00:00.000Z	shcherbak	TyrantElf	i am afraid that would be max on this driver, if there is ati stuff use it to compare, if not check for randr and twinview on open-source driver.
2011-01-01T23:11:00.000Z	shcherbak	TyrantElf	yes
2011-01-01T23:12:00.000Z	shcherbak	TyrantElf	always you can remove it, also check your tv spec (from manufacturer website) what resolution it shuld support
2011-01-01T23:16:00.000Z	shcherbak	TyrantElf	ok, have you tried to boot into recovery and run failsafex on hdmi?
2011-01-01T23:16:00.000Z	shcherbak	TyrantElf	of try xinit from tty and see what errors come up
2011-01-01T23:21:00.000Z	shcherbak	TyrantElf	you mean xinit?
2011-01-01T23:22:00.000Z	shcherbak	TyrantElf	first, can you see terminal on hdmi, can you login?
2011-01-01T23:29:00.000Z	shcherbak	TyrantElf	so, when you boot on hdmi what happent (try to hold shift on boot to see grub)
2011-01-01T23:34:00.000Z	shcherbak	TyrantElf	did you try to press Alt-Ctlr-F1 on after it goes blank?
2011-01-01T23:34:00.000Z	shcherbak	TyrantElf	other way press e in grub menu
2011-01-01T23:36:00.000Z	shcherbak	TyrantElf	by the way, try to shche<TAB> when you adress me, I do not have too many colors, so hard to find you.
