2006-09-23T08:43:00.000Z	jifjosh		Ubuntu says that KPPP isn't compatible? Why is ti doing this?
2006-09-23T08:43:00.000Z	sethk	jifjosh	possibly because it isn't compatible?
2006-09-23T08:43:00.000Z	sethk	jifjosh	tell us what you are doing, exactly.
2006-09-23T08:45:00.000Z	sethk	jifjosh	don't you have a ppp implementation that you can use in the package manager?
2006-09-23T08:45:00.000Z	sethk	jifjosh	there is certainly support for ppp.
2006-09-23T08:48:00.000Z	jifjosh	sethk	If i do, i have no clue where it is, I jsut got my discs in the mail today
2006-09-23T08:48:00.000Z	jifjosh	sethk	the PPP that is
2006-09-23T08:48:00.000Z	sethk	jifjosh	yes, I saw it the first time.
2006-09-23T08:48:00.000Z	sethk	jifjosh	where did you get kppp from?
2006-09-23T08:50:00.000Z	jifjosh	sethk	sorry for seeming rude, just a little crazy in here, i was trying to access it from the ubuntu disc, but the system is trying to access the internet. catch 22, it can't connect to the internet without the kppp which it needs to connect to get. blows the mind!
2006-09-23T08:50:00.000Z	sethk	jifjosh	yes, but I'm confused.  why kppp?  are you using kde?
2006-09-23T08:51:00.000Z	jifjosh	sethk	honestly, im not sure, im using whatever the default ubuntu setup is using
2006-09-23T08:51:00.000Z	sethk	jifjosh	that's gnome
2006-09-23T08:51:00.000Z	sethk	jifjosh	unless you have the kubuntu cd rather than the ubuntu cd
2006-09-23T08:52:00.000Z	jifjosh	sethk	so i jsut switch it and then im golden, I know where to change from KDE to GNOME
2006-09-23T08:52:00.000Z	jifjosh	sethk	im using an Ubuntu cd
2006-09-23T08:53:00.000Z	sethk	jifjosh	try it, hopefully the gnome installation doesn't have this circular dependency bug
2006-09-23T08:54:00.000Z	jifjosh	sethk	thanks, im going to go try that now, hopefully I won't be back ;-)
