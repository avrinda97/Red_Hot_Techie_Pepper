2011-09-09T13:47:00.000Z	Snicksie		shouldn't matter in the booting process, should it? :)
2011-09-09T13:49:00.000Z	Snicksie		have you tried installing grub into the mbr, Bash ?
2011-09-09T13:49:00.000Z	Bash	Snicksie	I think I did, can I double-check to make sure?
2011-09-09T13:50:00.000Z	Bash		I mean now if I'm to try it again so I know for sure.
2011-09-09T13:50:00.000Z	Snicksie		you said you installed it to sdc2 ? That doesn't seem a mbr, it seems like a pbr ;) Just try sdc instead :)
2011-09-09T13:51:00.000Z	Bash	Snicksie	Right, grub is installed on sdc2 but it's pointed to boot at sdc
2011-09-09T13:51:00.000Z	Bash		Atleast I think that's the way?
2011-09-09T13:52:00.000Z	Snicksie		i'm not 100% sure, but I only got my ubuntu back bootable by installing grub to sda (so that means in your case sdc :) )
2011-09-09T13:54:00.000Z	Bash	Snicksie	Looks like it's both installed to mbr of sda and sdc
2011-09-09T13:55:00.000Z	Bash		http://paste.ubuntu.com/685849/
2011-09-09T13:55:00.000Z	Bash		Correct me if I'm wrong, but "looks at sector 1 of the same hard drive", wouldn't that mean it checks sdc1, which is windows?
2011-09-09T13:57:00.000Z	Snicksie		i guess sector 1 is NOT used by windows, Bash ... as far as I can see, windows only starts from sector 1701 and further :)
2011-09-09T13:58:00.000Z	Snicksie	thoidingjam	do you mean /nickserv sendpass thoidingjam  ?
2011-09-09T13:58:00.000Z	Snicksie		*/msg nickserv sendpass ...
2011-09-09T13:59:00.000Z	Bash	Snicksie	Alright, but grub on mbr sda that shouldn't have any effect on grub on sdc though right?
2011-09-09T13:59:00.000Z	Snicksie		you should send that in a private message to nickserv
2011-09-09T13:59:00.000Z	Snicksie		it might chainload from sda to sdc, but it shouldn't have any effect as far as I know, although my knowledge is limited to :p
2011-09-09T14:00:00.000Z	Bash	Snicksie	I might have to take a look at this tomorrow. Thanks anyway!
