2008-06-06T20:16:00.000Z	roland_		Hi!
2008-06-06T20:16:00.000Z	roland_		I just found out that only 8 characters of a password are significant. The rest is ignored.
2008-06-06T20:17:00.000Z	roland_		My root password is 0123456789, but 01234567 works as well.
2008-06-06T20:17:00.000Z	roland_		How can I set this limit higher?
2008-06-06T20:17:00.000Z	ASULutzy	roland_	huh?

2008-06-06T20:18:00.000Z	ASULutzy	roland_	Are you sure you're not thinking of LM Hash?
2008-06-06T20:18:00.000Z	roland_	ASULutzy	well, maybe. I suppose it is a pam option for the pam_unix.so module.
2008-06-06T20:19:00.000Z	ASULutzy	roland_	On my machine if I try to short my sudo password by a character it doesn't accept it
2008-06-06T20:19:00.000Z	roland_	ASULutzy	but how can I use longer passwords that are not silently truncated?
2008-06-06T20:20:00.000Z	roland_	ASULutzy	is it longer that 8 characters?
2008-06-06T20:21:00.000Z	ASULutzy	roland_	yes
2008-06-06T20:21:00.000Z	ASULutzy		My password is 11 characters long
2008-06-06T20:21:00.000Z	roland_	ASULutzy	aha. If _I_ sudo, it _does_ accept my password if I truncate it to 8 chars (but not lower). So: how come?
2008-06-06T20:22:00.000Z	roland_	ASULutzy	can you tell me what is in you /etc/pam.d/common-passwd file?
2008-06-06T20:23:00.000Z	ASULutzy	roland_	one sec
2008-06-06T20:25:00.000Z	ASULutzy	roland_	I don't have an /etc/pam.d/common-passwd though I do have /etc/pam.d/common-password, which contains http://paste.ubuntu.com/17605/
2008-06-06T20:28:00.000Z	roland_	ASULutzy	how weird. The line that matters, about pam_unix.so, is the same as mine.
