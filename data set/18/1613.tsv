2011-09-07T00:28:00.000Z	BarkingFish	trism	can I just check, the linux-firmware-nonfree, do you know if there's any firmware in there for atheros usb and rtl8192cu sticks?
2011-09-07T00:29:00.000Z	trism	BarkingFish	I'm sorry, I do not know, I just have a bunch of p54 cards and they need the isl firmware
2011-09-07T00:34:00.000Z	BarkingFish	trism	sorry to bother you again, but how do you use the firmware once you've installed the package? Where do I put it and so on?
2011-09-07T00:36:00.000Z	trism	BarkingFish	it should be detected automatically and used if available (for my cards, there is a line in dmesg that will list when the firmware is detected, or missing)
2011-09-07T00:37:00.000Z	trism	BarkingFish	good luck
2011-09-07T00:54:00.000Z	BarkingFish	trism	unfortunately, the autodetection was a spectacular failure
2011-09-07T00:56:00.000Z	trism	BarkingFish	did you look at the dmesg output when plugging in your card?
2011-09-07T00:56:00.000Z	BarkingFish	trism	yes, there was none.
2011-09-07T00:57:00.000Z	trism	BarkingFish	which wireless usb device is this?
2011-09-07T00:58:00.000Z	BarkingFish	trism	the first one is a Siemens Gigaset USB 108 (129B:160C) and the second is an RTL 8167, using the 8192cu firmware (0BDA:8167)
2011-09-07T01:08:00.000Z	BarkingFish	trism	i'll keep what i have for now then. Thanks for the help anyway :)
2011-09-07T01:05:00.000Z	trism	BarkingFish	from a quick search, it doesn't seem like the ar5523 driver is included in the kernel yet (although the info I found may be outdated), http://wiki.debian.org/ar5523 describes how to build the work-in-progress one (may be better off with ndiswrapper if it is working though)
2012-10-19T05:08:00.000Z	trism	BarkingFish	failing to build? bug 1023645 , seems it needs updating to 1.58 (I don't know if it is out yet)
2012-10-19T05:09:00.000Z	BarkingFish	trism	- brilliant.  Can I attach that to a question I posted?  #211619
2012-10-19T05:10:00.000Z	trism	BarkingFish	sure can
2012-10-19T05:12:00.000Z	BarkingFish	trism	ok - i've linked bug 1023645 to question 211619, I'll leave it at that for now - I can still get on the internet, all I've done is reinstalled the headers for 3.2.0-32 generic, which allowed me to rebuild ndiswrapper-dkms against that kernel :)
2012-10-19T05:23:00.000Z	BarkingFish	trism	one minor problem, the bug you linked me to is great - but it doesn't mention where I can download ndiswrapper 1.58rc1 from :)
