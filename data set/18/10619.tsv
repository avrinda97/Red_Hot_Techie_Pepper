2007-12-09T08:35:00.000Z	cellofellow		no NOT DOS prompt, UNIX shell == DOS prompt to the tenth power.
2007-12-09T08:35:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	cellofellow	what are you talking about
2007-12-09T08:35:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	cellofellow	what are you talking about
2007-12-09T08:36:00.000Z	cellofellow	Jack_Sparrow	just that associating the shell with DOS puts a bad taste in peoples mouths so don't.
2007-12-09T08:36:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	cellofellow	If you READ... he will be booting Windows disk to a DOS prompt
2007-12-09T08:37:00.000Z	cellofellow	Jack_Sparrow	sorry.
2007-12-09T08:38:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	cellofellow	np.. just if you are going to correct someone.. you need to be right..
2007-12-09T08:38:00.000Z	cellofellow	Jack_Sparrow	how true.
2007-12-09T08:38:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	cellofellow	thanks for helping in channel

2008-01-16T03:10:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	cellofellow	A generic plug in reader or the one included with a laptop or vendor specific one?
2008-01-16T03:10:00.000Z	cellofellow	Jack_Sparrow	included in the laptop. Not sure the make and model.
2008-01-16T03:10:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	cellofellow	Better off spending the 6 - 10 and get a universal.. they dont give out info on those which makes it extremely hard to build or get a driver
2008-01-16T03:11:00.000Z	cellofellow	Jack_Sparrow	ok. that really sucks as it would be useful to actually, well, use.
2008-01-16T03:12:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	cellofellow	Helps to buy supported hardware.. at least it is an easy and inexpensive fix.
2008-01-16T03:12:00.000Z	cellofellow	Jack_Sparrow	what are the chances of a laptop not built for linux being 100% supported? It's not the only driver issues with this, the nvidia hda-intel soundcard doesn't work either.
2008-02-13T04:11:00.000Z	cellofellow	Jack_Sparrow	same thing
