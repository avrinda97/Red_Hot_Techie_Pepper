2009-11-23T20:04:00.000Z	g__		ugh - turboprint it is :(
2009-11-23T20:04:00.000Z	g__		now to cough up $30 just to print
2009-11-23T20:05:00.000Z	g__		it seems the only thing you want to use linux for is programming. it still fails at everything else
2009-11-23T20:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	g__	could buy a super compatible printer or one with free support like HP
2009-11-23T20:06:00.000Z	g__	ActionParsnip	that'd be > $30
2009-11-23T20:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	g__	i guess, always check hcl before hardware purchases, saves disappointment
2009-11-23T20:07:00.000Z	g__	ActionParsnip	yeah, but i bought this printer years ago for windows
2009-11-29T01:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	g__	mplayer, vlc, dragon, kafeine, totem
2009-11-29T01:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	g__	install smplay or gmplayer, you will get pretty uttons to click
2009-12-01T04:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	g__	useradd -G group user
2009-12-01T04:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	g__	needs sudo
2009-12-01T04:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	g__	easy stuff
2009-12-01T04:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	g__	you can verify with: groups user
2009-12-01T04:23:00.000Z	g__	ActionParsnip	nope - i failed :(
2009-12-01T04:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	g__	you can also run: gksudo users-admin
2009-12-01T04:24:00.000Z	g__	ActionParsnip	that's to add a new user though? i need to add an existing user to a group
2009-12-01T04:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	g__	to add a new user to an existing group: sudo useradd -g group new_user_name
2009-12-01T04:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	g__	the gksudo command I gave will allow you to make another user and add it to whatever groups you wish
