2008-08-25T01:17:00.000Z	rahil		another question....this one is probably noobish....but how do you use ls to only list directories, not files....i tried ls -d but that didn't work
2008-08-25T01:17:00.000Z	unop	rahil	ls */  # perhaps
2008-08-25T01:18:00.000Z	unop	rahil	you could also use find.  find . -type d
2008-08-25T01:26:00.000Z	unop	rahil	use your editor .. put commands in .. save the file and run it like this.   sh /path/to/file
2008-08-25T01:33:00.000Z	unop	rahil	 ( echo "text here"; printf "%s\n" */ ) > file
2008-08-25T01:34:00.000Z	rahil	unop	I di that, but it only wrote the directory listing
2008-08-25T01:36:00.000Z	unop	rahil	you probably didn't use the command properly?  let's see what you have there.
2008-08-25T01:37:00.000Z	rahil	unop	you're right....i forgot the parentheses....but this writes each one on a new line, is it possible that for each directory it appends the text to it on the same line?
2008-08-25T01:37:00.000Z	unop	rahil	change the printf to.  printf "%s " */
2008-08-25T01:40:00.000Z	unop	rahil	printf "text %s " */ # i think
2008-08-25T01:41:00.000Z	unop	rahil	actually, you mentioned newlines printf "text %s\n" */ # i think
2008-08-25T01:46:00.000Z	rahil	unop	if i wanted to add text to the end too, wouldn't I just have to add " text" after the */
2008-08-25T01:46:00.000Z	unop	rahil	no .. you need to add the text in the format section ..   printf " text %s text " */
2008-08-25T01:47:00.000Z	unop	rahil	actually printf " text %s text\n" */
2008-08-25T02:02:00.000Z	rahil	unop	whenever I run ( printf "dpkg-deb -b ./%s > ./%s.deb \n" * ) > commands.sh , I get http://paste.ubuntu.com/40256/
2008-08-25T02:05:00.000Z	unop	rahil	 maybe you should use a for loop like this.  for file in *; do echo "dpkg-deb -b ./$file > ./$file.deb"; done
2008-08-25T02:06:00.000Z	unop	rahil	the reason printf if giving you that is because with each use of %s in the format.. the next file from the glob is used.
2008-08-25T02:09:00.000Z	rahil	unop	yes that did it :)
