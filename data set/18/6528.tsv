2008-05-25T10:07:00.000Z	yit4s		DNS setting is really getting to my nerves |)
2008-05-25T10:08:00.000Z	tritium	yit4s	why are you configuring DNS?
2008-05-25T10:09:00.000Z	yit4s		﻿tritium: i just need DNS servers enter to access my internet on firefox. it keeps changing to 192.168.1.1 (the router). i dont have trouble with this on windows
2008-05-25T10:10:00.000Z	tritium	yit4s	which router do you have?
2008-05-25T10:11:00.000Z	yit4s		﻿tritium: D-Link something... i'm connected to my neighbour's router. the point is why Ubuntu keeps changing it??
2008-05-25T10:11:00.000Z	tritium	yit4s	you know how to configure dhcp3-client to prepend your servers, right?
2008-05-25T10:12:00.000Z	tritium	yit4s	it could be on the router side, which is why I asked.
2008-05-25T10:12:00.000Z	yit4s		﻿tritium: i did just now. but i dont think it is working or i might set it up wrongly
2008-05-25T10:12:00.000Z	yit4s		﻿tritium: like i said, i dont have any problem on windows, connected to the same router on the same laptop
2008-05-25T10:12:00.000Z	tritium	yit4s	you could configure the dhcp client, or you could set yourself up to use OpenDNS.
2008-05-25T10:12:00.000Z	tritium	yit4s	but then again, you shouldn't be stealing from your neighbor, either
2008-05-25T10:13:00.000Z	yit4s		﻿tritium: maybe you could show me how to set up the dhclient?
2008-05-25T10:13:00.000Z	yit4s		﻿tritium: it's his fault. he never turns off his router and put a WEP key
2008-05-25T10:14:00.000Z	tritium	yit4s	no, don't give me that.  Take responsibility for your actions.
2008-05-25T10:14:00.000Z	tritium		!enter | NETWizz
2008-05-25T10:16:00.000Z	yit4s	tritium	anyway, can you help me solve my DNS problem? i also need this on other router back in my room. it's kinda part of the ISP's config which i dont know why
2008-05-25T10:17:00.000Z	tritium		!enter | NETWizz (for the second time)
2008-05-25T10:17:00.000Z	tritium	yit4s	man dhclient.conf, and you'll see prepend and supersede options.  Look at those for entering the DNS server addresses.
