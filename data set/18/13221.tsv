2005-12-23T08:51:00.000Z	BoukenPink		Erm... Bittorrent seems to be blocked by something, and it's always yellow-lighted... On windows, I had to go into a port forwarding thing to make it work, and it uses the same ports on linux... but it doesn't seem to be working? :3
2005-12-23T08:52:00.000Z	dooglus	BoukenPink	you'll have to go through port-forwarding again.  your IP address is probably different in ubuntu
2005-12-23T08:53:00.000Z	dooglus	BoukenPink	don't download firestarter - it won't help you
2005-12-23T08:59:00.000Z	dooglus	BoukenPink	do you remember how you set up the windows box?  did you set a fixed internal IP address when you were doing the port forwarding setup?
2005-12-23T09:00:00.000Z	BoukenPink	dooglus	there was a set up program, and then there's like this website thing for the port forwarding.
2005-12-23T09:01:00.000Z	dooglus	BoukenPink	do you intend to use the Windows box and the ubuntu box at the same time?  Or is it a single dual-boot box?
2005-12-23T09:01:00.000Z	BoukenPink	dooglus	it's dual-boot.
2005-12-23T09:01:00.000Z	dooglus	BoukenPink	so this is what you need to do:
2005-12-23T09:02:00.000Z	dooglus	BoukenPink	boot into XP, find out what IP address it uses on your LAN, then boot into ubuntu and set it to use the same IP address
2005-12-23T09:02:00.000Z	BoukenPink	dooglus	sounds simple enough... :3
2005-12-23T09:02:00.000Z	dooglus	BoukenPink	or, if you like, to avoid booting into XP, look at the router's port-forwarding config, and see where it's currently forwarding bittorrent packets to, and set your IP address to match
2005-12-23T09:03:00.000Z	BoukenPink	dooglus	how do I do the IP address setting part?
2005-12-23T09:03:00.000Z	dooglus	BoukenPink	you click on 'system' at the top of the screen, then 'admin', then 'networking'
2005-12-23T09:05:00.000Z	dooglus	BoukenPink	then select your network interface, click properties, select 'static' in configuration and supply the other fields it asks for
2005-12-23T09:08:00.000Z	BoukenPink	dooglus	could it have anything to do with the hostname of my linux partition being different than the XP partition?
2005-12-23T09:13:00.000Z	dooglus	BoukenPink	it could, indeed, depending on how your router decides where to forward the packets to.
2005-12-23T09:13:00.000Z	dooglus	BoukenPink	of course, you can use a different port for the ubuntu OS if you want to
2005-12-23T09:13:00.000Z	dooglus	BoukenPink	bittorrent will run on any port you like - it doesn't have to be 6881
