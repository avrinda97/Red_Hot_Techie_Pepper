2007-03-24T16:02:00.000Z	peter77		when I plug in headphones the sound output doesn't stop from the speakers, instead it plays through both the headphones and speakers!
2007-03-24T16:02:00.000Z	peter77		is there a way to get this to switch over automatically?
2007-03-24T16:04:00.000Z	peter77		has anyone else experienced this issue when using headphones?
2007-03-24T11:41:00.000Z	peter77		When I plug a pair of headphones into my Toshiba Satellite pro laptop the sound through the speakers doesn't switch off, instead sound plays through both the speakers and the headphones
2007-03-24T11:41:00.000Z	peter77		This doesn't happen in windows xp and therefore must be a driver problem, does anyone have any experience with this kind of problem?
2007-03-24T11:42:00.000Z	BLAM	peter77	that's a weird one.
2007-03-24T11:42:00.000Z	peter77		anyone?
2007-03-24T11:42:00.000Z	peter77	BLAM	yeah
2007-03-24T11:42:00.000Z	peter77		I think it uses an intel sound card
2007-03-24T11:43:00.000Z	BLAM	peter77	I was going to tell you to check the BIOS settings but, uh, yeah, I'm stumped
2007-03-24T11:43:00.000Z	peter77		I can manually switch off the speakers by mutting "front" in the volume preferences
2007-03-24T11:44:00.000Z	peter77		it's just that automatic switching between speakers and headphones which doesn't work
2007-03-24T11:44:00.000Z	BLAM	peter77	but doesn't that also mute the headphones?
2007-03-24T11:45:00.000Z	BLAM		manton: what is your questiion?
2007-03-24T11:45:00.000Z	peter77	BLAM	no, to do that I have to mute "PCM"
2007-03-24T11:45:00.000Z	peter77		which mutes both
2007-03-24T11:46:00.000Z	BLAM	peter77	I had a similar problem with my thinkpad, but can't remember how I fixed it. sorry! have you tried a quick google?
2007-03-24T11:46:00.000Z	peter77	BLAM	yeah
