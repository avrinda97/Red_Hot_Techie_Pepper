2005-11-15T10:20:00.000Z	SEJeff	nicholaspaul	Good with firestarter? That is really easy to use
2005-11-15T10:20:00.000Z	nicholaspaul	SEJeff	have you shared connections with it?
2005-11-15T10:20:00.000Z	nicholaspaul	SEJeff	i'm using a crossover cable
2005-11-15T10:21:00.000Z	SEJeff	nicholaspaul	In firestarter: Firewall ---> Run Wizard
2005-11-15T10:21:00.000Z	nicholaspaul	SEJeff	i've done that. I've been thru howto's and nothing works for me
2005-11-15T10:22:00.000Z	SEJeff	nicholaspaul	echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
2005-11-15T10:23:00.000Z	nicholaspaul	SEJeff	i got 'command not found'
2005-11-15T10:24:00.000Z	SEJeff	nicholaspaul	Well you didn't type it right. echo is a bash builtin command
2005-11-15T10:25:00.000Z	SEJeff	nicholaspaul	scroll up
2005-11-15T10:26:00.000Z	nicholaspaul	SEJeff	permission denied. And i copy/pasted
2005-11-15T10:26:00.000Z	SEJeff	nicholaspaul	sorry, I forgot. Put sudo in front of it
2005-11-15T10:26:00.000Z	nicholaspaul	SEJeff	i put sudo infront.
2005-11-15T10:26:00.000Z	SEJeff	nicholaspaul	no. You won't get permission denied if you use sudo
2005-11-15T10:26:00.000Z	SEJeff	nicholaspaul	Unless your user isn't in the admin group
2005-11-15T10:27:00.000Z	nicholaspaul	SEJeff	 i can normally sudo just fine
2005-11-15T10:30:00.000Z	nicholaspaul	SEJeff	that wiki on internet sharing makes no sense to me :(
2006-01-22T10:37:00.000Z	SEJeff	nicholaspaul	if you don't know, you likely shouldn't be using dapper
