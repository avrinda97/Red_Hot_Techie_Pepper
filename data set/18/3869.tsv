2009-10-04T09:55:00.000Z	jasonmchristos	Celroc	just cut and paste the command into terminal. did it ask for the password?
2009-10-04T09:55:00.000Z	Celroc	jasonmchristos	Yeah, but when I tried to update it It would still get stuck again
2009-10-04T09:56:00.000Z	jasonmchristos	Celroc	hmmm. always try restarting. then run the fix
2009-10-04T09:56:00.000Z	Celroc	jasonmchristos	I think I'm getting it, though. I ran "sudo dpkg --remove (package name) and that may have helped
2009-10-04T09:57:00.000Z	Celroc	jasonmchristos	.... or not. I'll try restarting
2009-10-04T09:57:00.000Z	jasonmchristos	Celroc	what repo is it from?
2009-10-04T09:58:00.000Z	Celroc	jasonmchristos	Not sure. It's a OpenOffice update
2009-10-04T09:58:00.000Z	jasonmchristos	Celroc	is it from the standard sources?
2009-10-04T09:58:00.000Z	Celroc	jasonmchristos	Yeah
2009-10-04T09:59:00.000Z	jasonmchristos	Celroc	well restart and run that command, otherwise do a Complete removal of the package first then add it back
2009-10-04T10:00:00.000Z	Celroc	jasonmchristos	Ok. brb
2009-10-04T10:00:00.000Z	jasonmchristos	Celroc	but this will remove any settings you may have set
2009-10-04T10:00:00.000Z	Celroc	jasonmchristos	Oh. Well, that's ok.
2009-10-04T10:06:00.000Z	Celroc	jasonmchristos	Back. Tried running the command again and I don't think it worked...
2009-10-04T10:06:00.000Z	Celroc	jasonmchristos	I guess I should try to uninstall OpenOffice and reinstall
2009-10-04T10:07:00.000Z	jasonmchristos	Celroc	what error are you getting?
2009-10-04T10:08:00.000Z	Celroc	jasonmchristos	"Errors were encountered while processing: (Packages here)"... and when I opened up an update manager it said I have 6 broken packages
2009-10-04T10:10:00.000Z	jasonmchristos	Celroc	i would suggest doing the Complete removal optild have fixed iton on all six and putting them back in, but the command should have fixed it
