2011-03-27T18:19:00.000Z	ikonia	B9	is that a "yes" ?
2011-03-27T18:20:00.000Z	B9	ikonia	i am just feeling DUMBfounded that i can't discover what is on my flash drive... aghast in fact
2011-03-27T18:33:00.000Z	B9	ikonia	is there a commandline that will rust reinstall 10.10?
2011-03-27T18:33:00.000Z	ikonia	B9	no
2011-03-28T16:00:00.000Z	ikonia	B9	what happened to break it
2011-03-28T16:32:00.000Z	B9	ikonia	i was helping someone set up a google account here and then i couldn't find any answers in the history, please forgive me... the i have in 10.10 has become corrupted
2011-03-28T16:33:00.000Z	ikonia	B9	what did you do, what happned to make it fail
2011-03-28T16:33:00.000Z	B9	ikonia	it has become associated with images ONLY
2011-03-28T16:33:00.000Z	ikonia	B9	no, what happened, what did you do to cause this problem
2011-03-28T16:34:00.000Z	B9	ikonia	i cannot answer that with full knowledge, to my knowledge i personally have done nothing to make the change... i have systematically had many aspects of the 10.10 gui of the os drop away... i no longer have the panel on the right... i am unsure what its technical name is
2011-03-28T16:36:00.000Z	B9	ikonia	the panel on the left, please forgive me, the one with all the shortcuts to applications
