2007-06-18T08:43:00.000Z	cute_bettong		ok i give up
2007-06-18T08:43:00.000Z	cute_bettong		it's impossible to network ubuntu to windows it seems
2007-06-18T08:44:00.000Z	cute_bettong		im trying to get help from people who actually want to help others
2007-06-18T08:45:00.000Z	cute_bettong		your the one that seems to have an attitude...im just trying to get help and your calling people stupid
2007-06-18T08:45:00.000Z	cute_bettong		somehow you got your version of help way wrong
2007-06-18T08:47:00.000Z	cute_bettong		actually thats part of the problum.... i don't know anything about this network...i just moved here....
2007-06-18T08:48:00.000Z	cute_bettong		ok so let me make a clarification then... it's impossible for me to network ubuntu to a windows box.... i simply do not have the knowledge to do it...which does not make me stupid.
2007-06-18T08:48:00.000Z	cute_bettong		it's a wonder at my age i can even do it
2007-06-18T08:49:00.000Z	cute_bettong		i cannot figure out the howto for samba....you have to know something about networking to do things like that
2007-06-18T08:49:00.000Z	cute_bettong		what the heck did i do?
2007-06-18T08:49:00.000Z	shiester_miester	cute_bettong	samba is pretty difficult to use, i agree
2007-06-18T08:52:00.000Z	shiester_miester	cute_bettong	how did you get ubuntu to connect to the windows boxes?  i havent even been able to get that far -_-
2007-06-18T08:54:00.000Z	shiester_miester	cute_bettong	i think they are talking about entering commands in a terminal
2007-06-18T09:02:00.000Z	shiester_miester	cute_bettong	can you explain the solution you used to me :P im having trouble with samba too
2007-06-18T09:03:00.000Z	cute_bettong	shiester_miester	ill pull you into private chat and tell you...im sure they don't need extra spam in here XD
2007-06-18T09:06:00.000Z	cute_bettong	shiester_miester	did you get that private chat?
2007-06-18T09:07:00.000Z	shiester_miester	cute_bettong	yes
2007-06-18T09:08:00.000Z	shiester_miester	cute_bettong	did you have to use samba for your solution?
