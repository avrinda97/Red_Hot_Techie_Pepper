2007-06-21T12:53:00.000Z	user_		hey, guys, im installing a debian on an 32mb ram, 486 (or somthing like that) pentium. and HD size is 171mb, so i need a root and a swap partitions. the question is - "what would u advise as a swap partition size?" :)
2007-06-21T12:54:00.000Z	user_		so, nobody have any ideas? :(
2007-06-21T12:55:00.000Z	pha|con	user_	try a swap of 64mb
2007-06-21T12:55:00.000Z	user_	pha|con	ty man, ill try it i guess :)
2007-06-21T12:56:00.000Z	pha|con	user_	generally you want about 2x the amount of RAM you have as a swap space
2007-06-21T12:56:00.000Z	pha|con	user_	i don't know if that's true for today's systems, tho.
2007-06-21T12:58:00.000Z	user_	pha|con	aham, yes i know about 2x size of ram, just curious, i have 32mb ram, so if i take 64mb swap, what stays ah root? 100+/- mb... okay i guess its gonna be it :)
2007-06-21T12:58:00.000Z	pha|con	user_	 what distro are you installing?
2007-06-21T12:58:00.000Z	user_	pha|con	the one and only debian eh :D
2007-06-21T12:58:00.000Z	pha|con	user_	the only thing i can think of that's small enough for a drive that size is DSL
2007-06-21T12:59:00.000Z	pha|con	user_	does debian take up less than 100 MB?
2007-06-21T13:00:00.000Z	pha|con	user_	i don't think you'll be fitting debian on that drive
2007-06-21T13:00:00.000Z	user_	pha|con	euhm, my first idea was DSL indeed, but, i just wanted to try debian, cuz im about to put fluxbox on it, and that exactly the dsl, but i dont wanted to have DSL's configs alredy installed :)
2007-06-21T13:01:00.000Z	user_	pha|con	i hope, the minimum install will be okay ;) if no, dsl iz w8in' 4 me :D
2007-06-21T13:01:00.000Z	pha|con	user_	i think even the minimum install is too big for that drive
2007-06-21T13:02:00.000Z	user_	pha|con	hmmz ;)
2007-06-21T13:02:00.000Z	pha|con	user_	even if it does fit there it'll be ALL cli
2007-06-21T13:03:00.000Z	user_	pha|con	okay, afk trying 64mb
