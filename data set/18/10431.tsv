2006-12-03T10:14:00.000Z	whalesalad		tristianbob: unless its a mac, the best way to go is newegg
2006-12-03T10:15:00.000Z	whalesalad		im following thsi guide for the mysql portion, http://www.howtoforge.com/perfect_setup_ubuntu_6.10_p4
2006-12-03T10:16:00.000Z	whalesalad		mysqladmin -u root password yourrootsqlpassword    <- is the command that gives me errors
2006-12-03T10:16:00.000Z	whalesalad		im already root right now
2006-12-03T10:16:00.000Z	whalesalad		root@wsdev:/home/whalesalad# mysqladmin -u root password *******
2006-12-03T10:16:00.000Z	whalesalad		mysqladmin: connect to server at 'localhost' failed
2006-12-03T10:16:00.000Z	whalesalad		error: 'Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using password: NO)'
2006-12-03T10:18:00.000Z	blameless	whalesalad	what happens if you add a -p <oldpassword) after the -u root
2006-12-03T10:18:00.000Z	whalesalad	blameless	let me try that
2006-12-03T10:19:00.000Z	whalesalad	blameless	well it apparently works... hehe
2006-12-03T10:40:00.000Z	blameless	whalesalad	i tend to just sync my directories back and forth
2006-12-03T10:40:00.000Z	whalesalad	blameless	ive considered that and it wont work, i guess ill just need to move the server onto the same subnet and use samba or something
2006-12-03T10:41:00.000Z	blameless	whalesalad	is this macos to a windows box?
2006-12-03T10:43:00.000Z	blameless	whalesalad	there is of course, openafs
2006-12-03T10:45:00.000Z	whalesalad	blameless	this is os x to an ubuntu box (hence me being in the ubuntu room =]  )
2006-12-03T10:45:00.000Z	blameless	whalesalad	just checking :).  well you could set up openafs on the ubuntu box (as the server) and connect to it with an afs client on the os x box.  afs was always too complicated for me to setup though
2006-12-03T10:46:00.000Z	whalesalad	blameless	if its too complicated to setup its not gonna work :) i gotta do something totally seamless
