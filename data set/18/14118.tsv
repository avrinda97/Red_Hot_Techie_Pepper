2008-04-05T04:33:00.000Z	tag		So, not paying attention to what I've purchased, I've recently realized my laptop is 64 bit.  I'm wondering, is there a clean upgrade path from 32-bit ubuntu to 64-bit ubuntu?
2008-04-05T04:33:00.000Z	Flannel	tag	Unfortunately not.
2008-04-05T04:33:00.000Z	tag	Flannel	is there a usable upgrade path?
2008-04-05T04:34:00.000Z	Flannel	tag	No, 32->64bit (and v.v.) is a reinstall
2008-04-05T04:34:00.000Z	tag	Flannel	So, do you know of some reasonable 'install-over' instructions for a debian based distribution?
2008-04-05T04:35:00.000Z	Flannel	tag	You mean besides just popping in the CD?  sure.
2008-04-05T04:35:00.000Z	tag	Flannel	Well, I mean, keeping all the stuff I have installed and so on...
2008-04-05T04:35:00.000Z	Flannel	tag	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation has a bunch of stuff sans CD.  Keeping all your stuff.  do you have a separate home partition?
2008-04-05T04:36:00.000Z	Flannel	tag	that'll work regardless of the distro (since its just package names)
2008-04-05T04:36:00.000Z	tag	Flannel	Yes, but I want to keep my apps too.
2008-04-05T04:37:00.000Z	Flannel	tag	You'll have to reinstall them, and find 64bit versions for them.  Or run them in a32bit chroot.
2008-04-05T04:38:00.000Z	tag	Flannel	ugh
2008-09-05T10:08:00.000Z	Flannel	tag	why do you want to do that?
2008-09-05T10:08:00.000Z	tag	Flannel	sshfs and conflicting uids between systems
2008-09-05T10:09:00.000Z	Flannel	tag	Ah.  Unfortunately not that I'm aware of.  Supposed to just keep UIDs the same ;)
2008-09-05T10:09:00.000Z	Flannel	tag	there may be another way, I don't know of it though.
2008-09-05T10:14:00.000Z	tag	Flannel	luckily I can use sshfs -ouid=$UID
2008-12-14T12:33:00.000Z	Flannel	tag	If you're worried about it, stick with Hardy.  You can upgrade to 10.04 (the next LTS) in 2010
