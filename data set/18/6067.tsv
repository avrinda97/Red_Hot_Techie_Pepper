2010-05-11T07:09:00.000Z	Aquina		Is there a good alternative for KDE Komparator (program which compares directories and files)?
2010-05-11T07:10:00.000Z	maco	Aquina	still for kde or looking for a gnome one?
2010-05-11T07:21:00.000Z	Aquina	maco	I'm looking for a Gnome one. :-)
2010-05-11T07:22:00.000Z	maco	Aquina	meld?
2010-05-11T07:22:00.000Z	maco	Aquina	i havent used it, but i know it does diffs and merges and things
2010-05-11T07:28:00.000Z	maco	Aquina	searching in the repos im not coming up with anything, sorry
2010-05-20T19:41:00.000Z	maco	Aquina	no, file permissions go by UID not by username
2010-05-20T19:41:00.000Z	Aquina	maco	there are sideeffects however. Think about vyrious configuration files in ~/ or installed software and filesystem permissions (e.g. /usr/local/)
2010-05-20T19:42:00.000Z	Aquina	maco	a new username (Unix user) gets new IDS 1000+x
2010-05-20T19:42:00.000Z	maco	Aquina	which is why what you're saying results in more file permission problems
2010-05-20T19:43:00.000Z	maco	Aquina	if you keep your UID and just change the name attached to it, you dont have to go around and chown everything
2010-05-20T19:43:00.000Z	maco	Aquina	so they why are you saying that making a new username will make *fewer* complications?
2010-05-20T19:44:00.000Z	Aquina	maco	I say that because the user has to migrate manually and then can make appropriate changes in configuration and permissions. Maybe I expected to much though. :-)
2010-05-20T19:45:00.000Z	maco	Aquina	yeah see the extra manual changes sounds like "more work"
2010-05-20T19:46:00.000Z	Aquina	maco	indeed it is more work but you break less than by *just* changing the user and *then* breaking parts of the system (causing lock-outs, etc.)
2010-05-20T19:47:00.000Z	maco	Aquina	as long as those 3 files are in agreement, nothing should break
2010-05-20T19:48:00.000Z	Aquina	maco	that's only right for fs permissions in case the UID stays 1000 *and* when configurations paths in ~/* are updated or use $HOME (which some don't).
2010-05-20T19:49:00.000Z	maco	Aquina	configuration paths in ~/ ?? they should all be using $HOME and besides that, the directory in /home/ does not need to match the username
