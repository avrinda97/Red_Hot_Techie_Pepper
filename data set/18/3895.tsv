2010-07-27T16:26:00.000Z	gogeta1	dustin	vnc would be your best move there
2010-07-27T16:28:00.000Z	gogeta1	dustin	if its a windows box your connection to tight vnc is easy to install and use both server and viewer
2010-07-27T16:28:00.000Z	gogeta1	dustin	as long as she doesent hide behind a roughter it should work right off
2010-07-27T16:30:00.000Z	gogeta1	dustin	kinda the same rule but ubuntu will say it whont work this can only work over local network
2010-07-27T16:30:00.000Z	gogeta1	dustin	aslong as thers no roughter blocking thow it should work across the internet
2010-07-27T16:31:00.000Z	gogeta1	dustin	server side
2010-07-27T16:31:00.000Z	gogeta1	dustin	for a client it does not matter
2010-07-27T16:32:00.000Z	gogeta1	dustin	then you gotta open the ports for vnc and enable to foward to that machine
2010-07-27T16:33:00.000Z	gogeta1	dustin	newer roughters like my 2wire just have it as a 1 click option
2010-07-27T16:33:00.000Z	gogeta1	dustin	list of allowed apps and vnc to allow

2010-07-27T16:40:00.000Z	gogeta1	dustin	dd-wrt is a open source firmware that linksys was forced to relese and you had to hack a roughter to run it now some come with it factury
