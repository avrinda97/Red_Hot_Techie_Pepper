2009-11-16T08:29:00.000Z	jzacsh	ve0	i've never used this program, but "returned.XXX" usually means how the program reacted to an action you took. so: 400 may simply mean: go look up what the error 400 is in there documentation (the same style as 404 errors in http)
2009-11-16T08:30:00.000Z	ve0	jzacsh	thx) thats all i whant to know)
