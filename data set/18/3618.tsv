2011-04-30T16:24:00.000Z	Rehan	Sidewinder1	where is the Hardware Drivers section?
2011-04-30T16:25:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	Rehan	Try: System--> Hardware Drivers
2011-04-30T16:26:00.000Z	Rehan	Sidewinder1	thanks, i don't seem to have that menu option on 11.04 64bit
2011-04-30T16:27:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	Rehan	Ah, OK I'm using Lucid; I usually answer in that vein. Sorry I can't be of more help.
2011-04-30T16:27:00.000Z	Rehan		sidewalk: no need to be sorry, appreciate you taking the time to even answer
2011-04-30T16:28:00.000Z	Sidewinder1		Rehab: That's why I like LTS; I don't like having to relearn a 'new' system every six months...
2011-04-30T16:29:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	Rehan	But that's just me.
2011-04-30T16:29:00.000Z	Rehan	Sidewinder1	thanks
2011-04-30T16:30:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	Rehan	Welks
2011-04-30T16:32:00.000Z	Sidewinder1		Nah, vamp., it's workin' fine.
2011-04-30T16:34:00.000Z	Rehan	Sidewinder1	i have another question -- is there a way i can have File System show up in my Places dropdown menu in top panel?
2011-04-30T16:36:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	Rehan	Not sure how; it shows up in mine, in the left portion of the screen after I click home'
2011-04-30T16:36:00.000Z	Rehan	Sidewinder1	yea it shows up in my Home folder's left panel also but not in my Places dropdown from top panel...pretty annoying!
2011-04-30T16:39:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	Rehan	I'm sure there's a way to do want you want, but after a quick check, I'll be darned if I can see where. :-(
2011-04-30T16:41:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	Rehan	Why do you need to access the File System so often?
2011-04-30T16:41:00.000Z	Rehan	Sidewinder1	not sure haha, i just end up having to go in there quite a bit. All my media is on a different partition which is mounted, and then for some stuff i have to go into file system
2011-04-30T16:43:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	Rehan	OK, I have looked around quite extensively, in file system, but I don't need to that often.
