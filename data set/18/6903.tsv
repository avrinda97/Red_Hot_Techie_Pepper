2008-08-29T07:49:00.000Z	dft		alright, anyone else have any insight to the following message: http://paste.ubuntu.com/41423/
2008-08-29T07:51:00.000Z	cast	dft	can you add 'mount' to the aptitude install line?
2008-08-29T07:52:00.000Z	dft	cast	probably, you're thinking apt-get install nfs-common mount?
2008-08-29T07:52:00.000Z	cast	dft	regarding your paste :>
2008-08-29T07:53:00.000Z	dft	cast	my concern is why would mount, initscripts and system-services have to be removed?
2008-08-29T07:54:00.000Z	cast	dft	got anything strange in /etc/apt/sources.list?
2008-08-29T07:54:00.000Z	dft	cast	root@gibson:~# cat /etc/apt/sources.list
2008-08-29T07:55:00.000Z	cast	dft	wait, why are we talking in #ubuntu
2008-08-29T07:55:00.000Z	dft	cast	this box was built from ubuntu server 8.04
2008-08-29T07:57:00.000Z	cast	dft	oh, well. you're in unsupported land. if you want to use debian, install debian.
2008-08-29T07:57:00.000Z	cast	dft	but that explains how you're hitting such problems
2008-08-29T07:58:00.000Z	dft	cast	so you're telling me that out of the box, ubuntu server is pulling down from the debian repos and I get left in the dark because of it...hmmm
2008-08-29T07:58:00.000Z	cast	dft	surely not?
2008-08-29T07:59:00.000Z	cast	dft	if ubuntu server does that it should be an epic bug
2008-08-29T07:59:00.000Z	dft	cast	agreed
2008-08-29T07:59:00.000Z	dft	cast	I haven't manually changed that sources list
2008-08-29T08:00:00.000Z	cast	dft	hmmm. dunno. how about using debian :>
2008-08-29T08:01:00.000Z	dft	cast	as much as I'd love to tear down and rebuild this box, the time is not available
