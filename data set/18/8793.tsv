2007-06-23T08:41:00.000Z	Gnea	ScottishDuckHunt	yes.
2007-06-23T08:42:00.000Z	ScottishDuckHunt	Gnea	do you know if there it has good performance?
2007-06-23T08:42:00.000Z	Gnea	ScottishDuckHunt	depends what else is running - the more ram, the better performance
2007-06-23T08:44:00.000Z	Gnea	ScottishDuckHunt	cedega is usually better tho, especially for CS
2007-06-23T08:44:00.000Z	Gnea	ScottishDuckHunt	not free but not expensive either :)
2007-06-23T08:44:00.000Z	ScottishDuckHunt	Gnea	i know where to get cedega anyway :D
2007-06-23T08:45:00.000Z	Gnea	ScottishDuckHunt	if you play your cards right, you could run cedega and the vm at the same time ;)
2007-06-23T08:55:00.000Z	Gnea	ScottishDuckHunt	you have to setup a 32bit compatibility layer
