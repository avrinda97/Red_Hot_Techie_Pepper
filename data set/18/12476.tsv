2006-04-16T10:06:00.000Z	domino-24		Does anyone know of a decent encryption tool for ubuntu for encrypted a partition?
2006-04-16T10:07:00.000Z	CosmoDad	domino-24	there's a bunch of encryption ways. I like encryption on file system level though because it allows to backup data
2006-04-16T10:07:00.000Z	CosmoDad	domino-24	you can for example use the loopback device to encrypt
2006-04-16T10:08:00.000Z	domino-24	CosmoDad	is file system encryption easy?
2006-04-16T10:08:00.000Z	CosmoDad	domino-24	I like the comparison made by the encfs developer: http://arg0.net/wiki/encfs/intro2
2006-04-16T10:08:00.000Z	CosmoDad	domino-24	I use encfs, it's very easy
2006-04-16T10:08:00.000Z	CosmoDad	domino-24	encryption on device level requires some more effort
2006-04-16T10:09:00.000Z	domino-24	CosmoDad	I havn't heard of this one before, thanks - will delve into the reading now, must admit as much as I've looked around, I havn't really found many useful articles
2006-04-16T10:09:00.000Z	CosmoDad	domino-24	if you don't seek to hide all your mp3s from the RIAA, I'd suggest encfs :)
2006-04-16T10:09:00.000Z	domino-24	CosmoDad	I do seek that! lol
2006-04-16T10:10:00.000Z	CosmoDad	domino-24	hold on
2006-04-16T10:10:00.000Z	CosmoDad	domino-24	I think I have another link bookmarked..
2006-04-16T10:11:00.000Z	CosmoDad	domino-24	I liked this link: http://docs.indymedia.org/view/Local/UkCrypto
2006-04-16T10:12:00.000Z	domino-24	CosmoDad	thanks, will get some reading done today heh
2006-04-16T10:15:00.000Z	domino-24	CosmoDad	what would you suggest is a decent encryption algorithm nowadays? blowfish?
2006-04-16T10:17:00.000Z	CosmoDad	domino-24	hard to tell... use the links in the URL I gave ya pointing to wikipedia entries of the different encryption algos
2006-04-16T10:28:00.000Z	domino-24	CosmoDad	Thanks again for your help, have encrypted swap and a drive (hopefully) will reboot to check now, bye
2006-04-16T10:28:00.000Z	CosmoDad	domino-24	good luck
