2012-10-08T16:18:00.000Z	catphish_		and the model is broken by the fact that the user can't perform the administrative task of deleting itself :)
2012-10-08T16:18:00.000Z	catphish_		anyway, just my opinion
2012-10-08T16:19:00.000Z	gordonjcp	catphish_	what's wrong with having an initial user?
2012-10-08T16:19:00.000Z	catphish_	gordonjcp	read up
2012-10-08T16:19:00.000Z	gordonjcp	catphish_	I read up, I saw vague references to it being a "risk"
2012-10-08T16:20:00.000Z	gordonjcp	catphish_	which doesn't really make any sense
2012-10-08T16:20:00.000Z	gordonjcp	catphish_	if you don't have an initial user, how do you connect to your servers?
2012-10-08T16:21:00.000Z	catphish_	gordonjcp	i was commenting that in my environment it's not helpful, as i only have to delete it before i can create my normal users
2012-10-08T16:21:00.000Z	gordonjcp	catphish_	why not just create the initial user as one of your normal users, possibly you?
2012-10-08T16:21:00.000Z	catphish_	gordonjcp	a more normal flow for me is to configure authentication initial authentication as root
2012-10-08T16:21:00.000Z	gordonjcp	catphish_	you're going to need a wheel user anyway
2012-10-08T16:21:00.000Z	gordonjcp	catphish_	but you don't actually allow login as root, right?
2012-10-08T16:22:00.000Z	catphish_	gordonjcp	not once the system is configured, i have a daemon that manages my users and config files, once its running it disabled ssh root login, though i still like to have a root poassword for console login
2012-10-08T16:22:00.000Z	gordonjcp	catphish_	erk
2012-10-08T16:23:00.000Z	gordonjcp	catphish_	I tend to work on the assumption that if I see a Linux machine with a valid root password, it's been cracked
2012-10-08T16:26:00.000Z	gordonjcp	catphish_	no, because any time they sudo it is logged
2012-10-08T16:26:00.000Z	gordonjcp	catphish_	uh, that's why you are careful about how you configure sudo...
2012-10-08T16:27:00.000Z	gordonjcp	catphish_	most distros create an initial user these days
