2010-02-10T08:19:00.000Z	ardchoille	jken146	Probably "sed -i.backup" just to be safe
2010-02-10T08:32:00.000Z	ardchoille	jken146	just fyi, you can use "/" or "|" or "#" with sed
2010-02-10T08:43:00.000Z	ardchoille	jken146	please don't recommend mixing releases like that (Karmic/Lucid), can cause lots of problems.
2010-02-10T08:44:00.000Z	jken146	ardchoille	I'm not recommending it. It's probably a very bad idea for something like the kerne;
2010-02-10T09:26:00.000Z	ardchoille	jken146	the website pool has all the different ubuntu releases, and you're only on one release, this is why you see a diff between the site and the package manager
2010-02-10T09:27:00.000Z	ardchoille	jken146	for instance, trayer is available for Jaunty but not for Karmic, yet you'll still see it in packages.ubuntu.com
2010-02-10T09:28:00.000Z	jken146	ardchoille	I know that. This package is listed as being in intrepid, jaunty, karmic and lucid [multiverse]. I'm using karmic, and have multiverse in sources.list. Yet apt sees no package.
2010-02-10T09:28:00.000Z	ardchoille	jken146	which package?
2010-02-10T09:29:00.000Z	jken146	ardchoille	and it appears it's the same for songer. flashplugin-nonfree-extrasound
2010-02-10T09:29:00.000Z	ardchoille	jken146	you can ask the bot with:  !info package_name
2010-02-10T09:29:00.000Z	ardchoille	jken146	shows up in my package manager and I'm on Karmic
2010-02-10T09:36:00.000Z	jken146	ardchoille	This is Weird. I'm using gb.archive.ubuntu.com and if I browse that then I find the actual package on the server, as I'd expect. But I *don't* find it in http://gb.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/karmic/multiverse/binary-amd64/Packages.gz (that's where apt get's the package list, right?)
2010-02-10T09:36:00.000Z	ardchoille	jken146	I believe so
2010-02-10T09:37:00.000Z	ardchoille	jken146	Syncing issues maybe?
2010-02-10T09:37:00.000Z	ardchoille	jken146	between gb and main?
2010-02-10T09:38:00.000Z	jken146	ardchoille	architecture. It's not available for x86_64
2010-02-10T09:38:00.000Z	ardchoille	jken146	Ah, that explains it
