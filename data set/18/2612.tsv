2010-04-06T16:51:00.000Z	dhanesh		how much of swap space is needed for suspending ubuntu
2010-04-06T16:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dhanesh	  how much ram you have?
2010-04-06T16:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dhanesh	 you could try 1.5gb of swap. or if you got the HD space perhaps 2gb
2010-04-06T16:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dhanesh	 ive never had much luck with hibernate/suspend - too many other issues
2010-04-11T19:12:00.000Z	dhanesh	Dr_Willis	the best media player
2010-04-11T19:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dhanesh	 i use vlc 99% of the time these days
2010-04-11T19:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dhanesh	 ive rarely needed any plugins for vlc. most all of them are built in. I tend to install vlc, the ubuntu-restricted-extras and the w32/64codec pack from medibuntu - and ive rarely  found stuff i cant play
2010-04-11T19:16:00.000Z	dhanesh	Dr_Willis	which is the browser plugin that can play internet live video streams.
2010-04-11T19:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dhanesh	 it would totally depend on the stream i imagine. got a url you want me to test?
2010-04-11T19:17:00.000Z	dhanesh	Dr_Willis	from where i can get stream i imagine.
2010-04-11T19:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dhanesh	 differnt sites use differnt codecs/methods. i watch nasa tv - in ubuntu all the time.
2010-04-11T19:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dhanesh	 how? I go to the nasa tv web site.. click on view.. and it shows it...
2010-04-11T19:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dhanesh	 http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/nasatv/index.html
2010-04-11T19:19:00.000Z	dhanesh	Dr_Willis	good bye
2010-04-14T06:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dhanesh	 yes.. thats because its not a GUI tool.. You are thinking its a clone of the windows version.. its NOT.
2010-04-14T06:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dhanesh	 now that its installed the archive gui 's in linux should be able to handle 7zip arhives.
2010-04-14T06:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dhanesh	 use ark or file-roller or the cli tools.  or the 'unp' command
2011-03-13T12:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dhanesh	 fsck command has options , or the badblocks command i recall
