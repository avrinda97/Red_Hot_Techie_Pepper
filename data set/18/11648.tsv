2006-06-30T06:30:00.000Z	goonies		mplayer is obsolete?
2006-06-30T06:30:00.000Z	goonies		i typed apt-get install mplayer
2006-06-30T06:31:00.000Z	Warbo	goonies	apt-get install mplayer-386 (or whatever your system is) I think
2006-06-30T06:55:00.000Z	Warbo	goonies	Then use VLC :)
2006-06-30T06:57:00.000Z	Warbo	goonies	Did you install an MPlayer package?
2006-06-30T06:58:00.000Z	Warbo	goonies	Then try putting the codecs in /usr/lib/codecs (local is used for source code builds)
2006-06-30T07:00:00.000Z	goonies	Warbo	still the same, i open it, and as soon as mplayer opens it closes
2006-06-30T07:01:00.000Z	Warbo	goonies	What happens when you run gmplayer from a console (should give an error message)

2006-06-30T07:05:00.000Z	Warbo	goonies	Go in it's preferences and change the video output
2006-06-30T07:06:00.000Z	goonies	Warbo	what should i change it too
2006-06-30T07:07:00.000Z	Warbo	goonies	What is it at the moment?
2006-06-30T07:07:00.000Z	Warbo	goonies	Ah, change it to X11
2006-06-30T07:09:00.000Z	Warbo	goonies	That is the first thing I have to do with MPlayer, I don't know why it osn't default (I was going to say "X11" but I needed to know that you weren't already using it, since the error message was complaining about X11)
2006-07-25T15:15:00.000Z	Warbo	goonies	Because using the very latest version of something means you are giving up testing and security. Like Gentoo :)
2006-07-25T15:25:00.000Z	Warbo	goonies	It is to do with Firefox's license I think. Debian have sorted it by getting rid of the icon, and also turning off it's own updater (because it conflicts with Ubuntu/Debian's updater)
2006-07-25T15:32:00.000Z	goonies	Warbo	nice tool
2006-07-25T15:32:00.000Z	Warbo	goonies	(I had to wait for aptitude to load my cache before I could search :))
