2005-03-26T09:03:00.000Z	hendps		anyone else have any thoughts on getting the ati drivers to work?
2005-03-26T09:05:00.000Z	kotatsu	hendps	the latest ati drivers work for me, what's wrong?
2005-03-26T09:06:00.000Z	hendps	kotatsu	the drivers are installed, so is the restricted modules package. i've changed my xorg file to use fglrx driver, but the driver isn't being used
2005-03-26T09:06:00.000Z	kotatsu	hendps	are you using warty or hoary?
2005-03-26T09:06:00.000Z	hendps	kotatsu	fglrxinfo says mesa stuff is used, and extension "XFree-86 DRI is missing on display :0.0"
2005-03-26T09:06:00.000Z	hendps	kotatsu	 hoary
2005-03-26T09:07:00.000Z	kotatsu	hendps	are you using xfree86 or xorg?
2005-03-26T09:07:00.000Z	hendps	kotatsu	xorg
2005-03-26T09:07:00.000Z	hendps	kotatsu	everything is latest hoary
2005-03-26T09:07:00.000Z	kotatsu	hendps	do you have xorg-driver-fglrx installed?
2005-03-26T09:07:00.000Z	hendps	kotatsu	yeah
2005-03-26T09:08:00.000Z	kotatsu	hendps	can you post the contents of /var/log/Xorg.0.log somewhere I can see it?
2005-03-26T09:08:00.000Z	hendps	kotatsu	dpkg -l : ii  xserver-xorg   6.8.2-2        the X.Org X server
2005-03-26T09:08:00.000Z	hendps	kotatsu	shall i /msg it to you?
2005-03-26T09:18:00.000Z	hendps	kotatsu	hurrah - all working now :)
2005-03-26T09:21:00.000Z	hendps	kotatsu	i've been getting weird redraw problems which i hope this fixes. like when i switch desktops, some text isnt redrawn completely. i'll see how it goes
2005-03-26T09:24:00.000Z	kotatsu	hendps	you don't even need it in your modules file, the server will load it if it's not already when the server starts
2005-03-26T09:24:00.000Z	hendps	kotatsu	oh right, cool.
