2009-02-03T13:17:00.000Z	psypher246		hey all. i am having an issue installing ubuntu to a usb stick. essentially using the usb stick as a hard drive. it installs fine but when i try boot from it the pc does not see an OS to boot from, despite setting the USb to boot in the bios. what could be the issue. note this is not a live persistent install, it's a normal install using the usb stick as a hard drive.  thanks

2009-02-03T13:20:00.000Z	sexcopter	psypher246	hmmm... another option might be usb-creator ..?
2009-02-03T13:21:00.000Z	psypher246	sexcopter	no, thats not it, you not understanding what I mean. i don't want a bootbale live cd on a usb stick. i want to use a sub stick as a hard drive, so boot up with cd, choose to install ubuntu to usb stick and boot off that
2009-02-03T13:22:00.000Z	sexcopter	psypher246	i'm sorry, i don't really follow you
2009-02-03T13:23:00.000Z	psypher246	sexcopter	just ignore the fact that i'm using a usb stick and think of me installing ubuntu to a hard drivbe and the system won't see the os
2009-02-03T13:23:00.000Z	sexcopter	psypher246	oh, hang on, i think i see the misunderstanding. i was thinking of a usb stick, you mean an external hdd..?
2009-02-03T13:24:00.000Z	sexcopter	psypher246	ok, so just to check, did you run a live session, choose to install and partition the usb stick as if it were a harddrive?
2009-02-03T13:25:00.000Z	psypher246	sexcopter	YEs!
2009-02-03T13:25:00.000Z	sexcopter	psypher246	and you're sure your mobo/bios supports booting from usb?
2009-02-03T13:26:00.000Z	sexcopter	psypher246	sorry, unless i have a brainwave, i don't htink i'm going to be able to help. have you searched the forums/google?
2009-02-03T13:27:00.000Z	psypher246	sexcopter	yeah but everything talk about the live cd setup method, hard to find what i am referring to
2009-02-03T13:29:00.000Z	sexcopter	psypher246	here's a thought: perhaps you need to install to the usb stick (done already, i assume), but install grub to the first partition of your internal hdd, then you will probably have to craft an entry in /boot/grub/menu.lst that points to your usb partition. you could probably copy an entry from a normal installation and change the root
2009-02-03T13:34:00.000Z	psypher246	sexcopter	yeah i could do that, but the point is i'm trying to setup a minimal firewall with just a usb stick for storage. no hard drive. i'm starting to think that my problem at the moment is vmware and not the usb or setup. gonnatry with virtualbox
2009-02-03T13:37:00.000Z	sexcopter	psypher246	ok... the only other thing i can think of is when you boot from usb, it gets the device names wrong. perhaps if you specified devices/partitions by uuid that would fix it?
2009-02-03T13:38:00.000Z	psypher246	sexcopter	yeah i thought bout that as well, but i figured i would at least see grub then, all i get is no operating system found
2009-02-03T13:39:00.000Z	sexcopter	psypher246	in which case, sorry to say i think i'm out of ideas... see what your experiment in vmware yields....
2009-02-03T13:42:00.000Z	psypher246	sexcopter	yeah aparently the vm systems don't actually support this, mmmm
