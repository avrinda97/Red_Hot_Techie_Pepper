2005-11-20T06:13:00.000Z	benplaut		anyone here know anything about LDAP? trying to hook up my laptop as an LDAP client to the school server
2005-11-20T06:14:00.000Z	BenC	benplaut	what kind of client?
2005-11-20T06:14:00.000Z	BenC	benplaut	do you mean for authentication/authorization?
2005-11-20T06:15:00.000Z	benplaut	BenC	anything... i don't know where to begin
2005-11-20T06:15:00.000Z	BenC	benplaut	that's like asking "I need to setup my machine to be a SQL client"
2005-11-20T06:16:00.000Z	BenC	benplaut	apt-cache search openldap
2005-11-20T06:16:00.000Z	benplaut	BenC	ldap-utils... i've installed it
2005-11-20T06:17:00.000Z	BenC	benplaut	openldap-utils?
2005-11-20T06:17:00.000Z	benplaut	BenC	"ldap-utils - OpenLDAP utilities
2005-11-20T06:17:00.000Z	BenC	benplaut	then you're ready...what else do you want to do?
2005-11-20T06:18:00.000Z	benplaut	BenC	well... what do i do now? IE, is there a script to set it up, a config file to edit...
2005-11-20T06:18:00.000Z	BenC	benplaut	that depends completely on what you are using ldap for
2005-11-20T06:19:00.000Z	BenC	benplaut	ldap is as simple as "do this", it's all dependent on the data being stored there and how it's being used
2005-11-20T06:19:00.000Z	benplaut	BenC	i think it's meant to be setup in a way that the computer is acting, pretty much as a thin client
2005-11-20T06:19:00.000Z	BenC	benplaut	umm...ldap doesn't do anything like that
2005-11-20T06:19:00.000Z	BenC	benplaut	it can store usernames and passwords
2005-11-20T06:20:00.000Z	benplaut	BenC	okey dokey... i guess i'll have to get something else out of the netadmin :P
2005-11-20T06:21:00.000Z	BenC	benplaut	using ldap for auth, means you will need lots of stuff like PAM modules and PAM configuration
