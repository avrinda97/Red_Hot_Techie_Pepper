2005-05-11T12:45:00.000Z	unperson		Hi, I upgraded from Warty to hoary recently and periodically since the upgrade my machine grinds to a halt.  I hadn't figured out why until just now I notices that top shows 0 k for swap (free or used).  My swap partition does not show up when I run df, though it is in my /etc/fstab.  Anyone know what's going on here and how I get my system to use my swap again?
2005-05-11T12:46:00.000Z	usual	unperson	maybe swapon
2005-05-11T12:48:00.000Z	unperson	usual	 Checking out the man page...  Any idea why the upgrade made it start ignoring the swap?
2005-05-11T12:50:00.000Z	usual	unperson	no:(
2005-05-11T12:51:00.000Z	unperson		Hmmm...I gues I'll just try swapon -a and see what happens.
2005-05-11T12:53:00.000Z	unperson	usual	 Ok, any idea how I set it to use the swap on boot?
2005-05-11T12:53:00.000Z	usual	unperson	if you go to applications > system tools > System monitor
2005-05-11T12:53:00.000Z	usual		then click resources
2005-05-11T12:53:00.000Z	usual		does it say your using swap
2005-05-11T12:56:00.000Z	unperson	usual	 Hmm... "swapon: /dev/hda1: Invalid argument"
2005-05-11T12:56:00.000Z	unperson		that's ood
2005-05-11T12:56:00.000Z	unperson		odd, even.
2005-05-11T12:57:00.000Z	usual	unperson	is this just an ubuntu box?
2005-05-11T12:58:00.000Z	unperson	usual	 Well, there's a version of Windows on here, though it's really just a vestigal appendage these days.
2005-05-11T12:58:00.000Z	usual	unperson	but windows is usually on /dev/hda1
2005-05-11T12:58:00.000Z	unperson	usual	 Not in this case, though.
2005-05-11T12:58:00.000Z	usual	unperson	k
2005-05-11T12:59:00.000Z	unperson	usual	 But as I said, this was working with warty.  The only thing that changed was I changed my repositories to hoary and upgraded.
