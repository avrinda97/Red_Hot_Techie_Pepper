2011-10-01T07:53:00.000Z	csemple		hi I have a sd card that I use on computer A (ubuntu), but when I try to use it on computer B (ubuntu) I get "failed to mount" something about privalages
2011-10-01T07:53:00.000Z	csemple		how to I make this sd card accessible to multiple machines ?
2011-10-01T07:55:00.000Z	csemple		yeah I have used chmod ex0 but I don't know enough about what I am doing to prevent myself from screwing things up or doing something unnessesary
2011-10-01T07:56:00.000Z	csemple		I am guessing chmod u+r /media/disk ?
2011-10-01T07:56:00.000Z	csemple		sudo chmod ?
2011-10-01T07:57:00.000Z	qin	csemple	You sure that you are sudoer on B
2011-10-01T08:18:00.000Z	qin	csemple	Who is owner of files? You have differet usernames in A and B?
2011-10-01T08:19:00.000Z	csemple	qin	its hard to tell because thunar does not give me any "properties" on devices
2011-10-01T08:19:00.000Z	qin	csemple	ls -l /media/disk
2011-10-01T08:19:00.000Z	qin	csemple	Or with sudo if needed
2011-10-01T08:20:00.000Z	csemple	qin	drwxr-xr-x 4 root root 32768 2011-09-25 15:23 DCIM
2011-10-01T08:20:00.000Z	csemple	qin	that was the output ^
2011-10-01T08:20:00.000Z	csemple	qin	drwxr-xr-x 4 root root 32768 2011-09-25 15:23 DCIM
2011-10-01T08:21:00.000Z	qin	csemple	ls -l /media/disk/DCIM is it root too?
2011-10-01T08:22:00.000Z	qin	csemple	Is usb on A now?
2011-10-01T08:24:00.000Z	qin	csemple	Compare output of "groups" for users in A and B machine, I think group "plugdev" is important here.
2011-10-01T08:24:00.000Z	qin	csemple	and group "fuse"
2011-10-01T08:25:00.000Z	csemple	qin	yeah I have to go though I will work on this next time
