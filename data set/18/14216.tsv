2006-10-05T13:56:00.000Z	KEA0463		does ubuntu have the biggest support base
2006-10-05T13:56:00.000Z	Stormx2	KEA0463	out of what?
2006-10-05T13:57:00.000Z	Stormx2	KEA0463	I suppose so.
2006-10-05T13:57:00.000Z	Stormx2	KEA0463	For desktop linux, yes.
2006-10-05T13:58:00.000Z	Stormx2	KEA0463	Not necesserily. Some linux distros are meant for people switching from windows with little skill with computers.
2006-10-05T13:58:00.000Z	Stormx2	KEA0463	ubuntu is in the middle. It can be very easy to use but you can do all sorts of complex stuff with it
2006-10-05T13:59:00.000Z	Stormx2	KEA0463	Put it this way, you want have used linux for a little while before you try gentoo. Its an awful lot of compiling and customization
2006-10-05T14:05:00.000Z	Stormx2	KEA0463	its a bit tricky...
2006-10-05T14:05:00.000Z	Stormx2	KEA0463	Half the problems people have with wine is because they aren't calling it correctly...
