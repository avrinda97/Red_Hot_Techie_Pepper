2012-01-26T21:43:00.000Z	mcriddles		the trouble is, the application is not on the list
2012-01-26T21:43:00.000Z	mcriddles		nor in the "other applications" that are suggested
2012-01-26T21:43:00.000Z	mcriddles		(yes, i'm new to linux)
2012-01-26T21:44:00.000Z	mcriddles		i mean, it's really simple, i wanna use Sublime Text 2 to open up a text document
2012-01-26T21:44:00.000Z	html	mcriddles	 welcome to lunix/ubuntu
2012-01-26T21:45:00.000Z	html	mcriddles	 what do you need?
2012-01-26T21:48:00.000Z	mcriddles	html	i'm trying to set an application as a default for opening text files, but the application is not in the "preferred applications" list
2012-01-26T21:49:00.000Z	html	mcriddles	 you simply add it to the list, find the file, then right click ,
2012-01-26T21:50:00.000Z	mcriddles	html	that's the problem, i can only add items that are listed, and mine is unlisted
2012-01-26T21:51:00.000Z	html	mcriddles	 we need a snapshot  of what your talkin about, then pastebin
2012-01-26T21:51:00.000Z	mcriddles	html	i can't take a snapshot of something that doesn't exist.. :)
2012-01-26T21:52:00.000Z	html	mcriddles	 yes you can ,
