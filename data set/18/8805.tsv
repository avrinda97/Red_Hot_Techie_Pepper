2008-12-31T15:05:00.000Z	bidossessi	Sogod	only you can answer that
2008-12-31T15:06:00.000Z	bidossessi	Sogod	what graphics card do you have?
2008-12-31T15:08:00.000Z	bidossessi	Sogod	is it your first time installing linux?
2008-12-31T15:11:00.000Z	bidossessi	Sogod	the first thing you need to do is check wether your nvidia card has been recognized by your new OS, for that, you need to type either glxgears or  glxinfo | grep -i "^opengl vendor" in a console
2008-12-31T15:14:00.000Z	bidossessi	Sogod	that is good news. it means your graphics card has been properly setup
2008-12-31T15:15:00.000Z	bidossessi	Sogod	now, what you need to do is install the compiz packages. open your package management too. for that, using the menu, you open synaptic package manager, or something...
2008-12-31T15:16:00.000Z	bidossessi	Sogod	now what you need to do is activate compiz. for that, you can open your display properties, and under the visual effects tab, activate visual effects
2008-12-31T15:18:00.000Z	bidossessi	Sogod	once that is done, you can verify that compiz is working by doing, for example "ctrl-alt-right-arrow", and see if your screen does a nice visual effect
