2009-01-25T22:54:00.000Z	croddy	gordonjcp	also are you sure you need -rt?
2009-01-25T22:54:00.000Z	gordonjcp	croddy	yes
2009-01-25T22:55:00.000Z	gordonjcp	croddy	very very sure, thanks ;-)
2009-01-25T22:55:00.000Z	gordonjcp	croddy	how else would you do low latency audio?
2009-01-25T22:55:00.000Z	croddy	gordonjcp	in my experience most of the latency problems with audio were resolved in the 2.4 to 2.6 transition
2009-01-25T22:56:00.000Z	gordonjcp	croddy	yes, that's why I need -rt
2009-01-25T22:56:00.000Z	gordonjcp	croddy	unfortunately for some reason -rt breaks USB MIDI
2009-01-25T22:57:00.000Z	gordonjcp	croddy	and since two of my four MIDI interfaces are USB, this leaves me a bit stuck ;-)
2009-01-25T22:57:00.000Z	croddy	gordonjcp	have you considered building your own kernel? it is not nearly as complicated as it used to be, especially if you use kernel-package
2009-01-25T22:57:00.000Z	gordonjcp	croddy	if it's broken upstream, that's not really going to help
2009-01-25T22:58:00.000Z	gordonjcp	croddy	I suppose I could try building an un-tampered-with kernel
2009-01-25T22:58:00.000Z	croddy	gordonjcp	if i recall correctly, there is at least one patch you need to apply to boot from debian-style initrds, but it's been over a year since i've built a kernel for a debian system
2009-01-25T23:04:00.000Z	gordonjcp	croddy	the current kernel build system has the Cthulu nature ;-)
2009-01-26T03:01:00.000Z	gordonjcp	croddy	which keys?
2009-01-26T03:01:00.000Z	croddy	gordonjcp	the power button and the extra "=" on the numpad
2009-01-26T03:02:00.000Z	gordonjcp	croddy	I'm not sure the power button even sends a "normal" keycode
2009-01-26T03:10:00.000Z	croddy	gordonjcp	okay, showkey doesn't seem to be receiving anything either. i guess i should assume those keys just won't work for me in linux? (not a huge loss)
2009-01-26T03:10:00.000Z	gordonjcp	croddy	I'm not sure how showkey works, but I suspect that for the power key at least it may send something really peculiar
