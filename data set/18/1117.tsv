2011-05-24T22:23:00.000Z	sudokill	ziikutv	if u google it u can download it somewhere
2011-05-24T22:23:00.000Z	ziikutv		i installed ubuntu yesterday it updated.. but i never shut it down.. I booted to it today and its totally different with the launcher and everything.. I like the SNAP feature to split windows equally etc.. <3 Ubuntu
2011-05-24T22:23:00.000Z	ziikutv		Yeah I am aware of that; wasn't sure if it was legal.
2011-05-24T22:24:00.000Z	sudokill	ziikutv	it wont look exactly as clear as  ubuntus but similar
2011-05-24T22:24:00.000Z	sudokill	ziikutv	I doubt it's illegal
2011-05-24T22:24:00.000Z	sudokill		lol
2011-05-24T22:24:00.000Z	ziikutv	sudokill	Its coz those LCD hacks that are in Ubuntu as some one mentioned above right
2011-05-24T22:24:00.000Z	sudokill	ziikutv	yes, i mentioned it lol
2011-05-24T22:25:00.000Z	ziikutv	sudokill	I don't think its illegal because well... Ubuntu itself is open source wouldn't make sense to have copyrighted fotn.
