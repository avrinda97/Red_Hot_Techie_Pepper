2010-01-10T00:54:00.000Z	froglet		are bugs in apps included with Jaunty no longer being fixed?
2010-01-10T00:54:00.000Z	froglet		Karmic is too unstable or I would used that
2010-01-10T00:55:00.000Z	froglet		and the LTS version does not install on my netbook
2010-01-10T00:55:00.000Z	x_link	froglet	Hmm really? =/
2010-01-10T00:55:00.000Z	x_link	froglet	I just installed Karmic =(
2010-01-10T00:55:00.000Z	froglet	x_link	I can install it but from there it is all downhill
2010-01-10T00:55:00.000Z	x_link	froglet	Okey, doesn't sound good =/
2010-01-10T00:56:00.000Z	x_link	froglet	Ahh okey
2010-01-10T00:56:00.000Z	x_link	froglet	Well, it isn't Gimp
2010-01-10T00:56:00.000Z	x_link		Hmmm
2010-01-10T00:56:00.000Z	froglet		no GIMP is fine
2010-01-10T00:56:00.000Z	x_link		#ubuntu was a really good channel btw =)
2010-01-10T00:56:00.000Z	x_link	froglet	Yeah I know, but I never use gimp when I just want to have a quick look on some pictures
2010-01-10T00:56:00.000Z	x_link	froglet	Cause then I just want something small/simple.
2010-01-10T00:57:00.000Z	froglet	x_link	well the problem I have in Jaunty is that kgpg will not encrypt files
2010-01-10T00:57:00.000Z	froglet		I have to use Nautilus to do it
2010-01-10T00:58:00.000Z	froglet		I do not know what the gpg app in Nautilus is
2010-01-10T00:58:00.000Z	x_link	froglet	Aha okey, well I don't know much about this stuff =/
