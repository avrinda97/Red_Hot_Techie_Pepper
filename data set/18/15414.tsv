2005-03-31T07:04:00.000Z	Marble2		can someone help me? the timing with audio and video is off synch slightly in totem-xine. It's not just one file, it happens on any file I play
2005-03-31T07:05:00.000Z	^thehatsrule^	Marble2	turn down the quality?
2005-03-31T07:05:00.000Z	Marble2	^thehatsrule^	how do I do that?
2005-03-31T07:06:00.000Z	^thehatsrule^	Marble2	is it a dvd?
2005-03-31T07:07:00.000Z	Marble2	^thehatsrule^	xvid I think
2005-03-31T07:09:00.000Z	^thehatsrule^	Marble2	i know in windows, you can open a config for any codec... and change the quality
2005-03-31T07:11:00.000Z	Marble2	^thehatsrule^	ugh, I just checked and it happens in any player I use
2005-03-31T07:11:00.000Z	^thehatsrule^	Marble2	check the faq of the xvid driver?
2005-03-31T07:12:00.000Z	Marble2	^thehatsrule^	with what?
2005-03-31T07:13:00.000Z	^thehatsrule^	Marble2	if the video doesnt have that 'flag' rendered with it, on older hardware, video tends to be desynched with the audio
2005-03-31T07:13:00.000Z	Marble2	^thehatsrule^	I'm not exactly using older hardware
2005-03-31T07:15:00.000Z	^thehatsrule^	Marble2	maybe... is your video driver installed?
2005-03-31T07:16:00.000Z	^thehatsrule^	Marble2	search for the xvid frontend then,if your video driver is fine
2005-03-31T07:16:00.000Z	Marble2	^thehatsrule^	I don't know about my video driver...
2005-03-31T07:18:00.000Z	Marble2	^thehatsrule^	It's the same on divx files too
2005-03-31T07:21:00.000Z	Marble2	^thehatsrule^	it's not just xvid files.
2005-03-31T07:21:00.000Z	^thehatsrule^	Marble2	well, you could go to each codec config, and degrade each one
2005-05-06T08:17:00.000Z	^thehatsrule^	Marble2	top ?
