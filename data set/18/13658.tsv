2006-04-12T07:41:00.000Z	MenZa		Hmm... can anyone help me getting Gnome to run 1600x1200?
2006-04-12T07:42:00.000Z	MenZa		I have the nvidia-drivers (from Synaptic) - and my GFX card (and monitor) support it.
2006-04-12T07:42:00.000Z	MenZa		Thank you.

2006-04-12T07:42:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	MenZa	No problem :)
2006-04-12T07:44:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	MenZa	Probably, but you can check in #ubuntu+1 to make sure the procedure hasn't changed.  (We're in the process of fixing version specifications on the wiki, so if you find out the answer you may want to add that to the page.)
2006-04-12T07:45:00.000Z	MenZa	tonyyarusso	I've run into a problem already; It says "sh: /var/lib/xfree86/xorg.conf.md5sum: No such file or directory"
2006-04-12T07:47:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	MenZa	Okay.  a) I'll try to figure that out, b) You could ask in the Dapper channel too just in case.
2006-04-12T07:48:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	MenZa	What freakabcd said.  Can you find that file manually?  (I have it, so I'm not sure why you're getting an error on it.)
2006-04-12T07:48:00.000Z	MenZa	tonyyarusso	I can try.
2006-04-12T07:49:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	MenZa	Try something like 'locate xorg.conf.md5sum'
2006-04-12T07:51:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	MenZa	Ah, so that must be the Dapper difference then.  Does it work with that?
2006-04-12T07:51:00.000Z	MenZa	tonyyarusso	 yep. It's asking me for the desired X Server Driver. I suppose 'nv' is nvidia?
2006-04-12T07:51:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	MenZa	I think so, unless you have the binary proprietary ones.
2006-04-12T07:52:00.000Z	MenZa	tonyyarusso	I found one called 'Nvidia'. I assume that's the one ;)
2006-04-12T08:07:00.000Z	MenZa	tonyyarusso	It didn't work for some reason; I input my horizontal and vertical rates, restarted x - but 1600x1200 appears nowhere in the "Screen Resolution" setup.
2006-04-12T08:08:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	MenZa	Did you only change the rates, or try adding the res too?
2006-04-14T10:52:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	MenZa	I and a few others have seen that.  Mine was resolved by simply reloading the page.  I don't know of a permanent fix.  File it with Mozilla if it hasn't been done already (mention that it has the confirmation of at least 3 people).
