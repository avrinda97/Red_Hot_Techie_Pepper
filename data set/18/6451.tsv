2010-07-14T02:09:00.000Z	ikonia	Dennis	ok - so tail the syslog
2010-07-14T02:10:00.000Z	ikonia	Dennis	sudo tail -f /var/log/syslog
2010-07-14T02:12:00.000Z	ikonia	Dennis	that's annoying, not a good start, normally that should be static

2010-07-14T02:21:00.000Z	ikonia	Dennis	that at least explains a bit, your USB bus is resetting constantly, which explains why your disks don't get auto mounted
2010-07-14T02:22:00.000Z	ikonia	Dennis	that's a tough one, it really depends "why" it's doing it (not stating the obvious) it could be poor support for that usb bus, a problem with the kernel module, a hardware failure, a lot of things really
2010-07-14T02:22:00.000Z	ikonia	Dennis	from that short description, I'd "guess" a kernel update in 9.04 has introduced an issue with the driver
2010-07-14T02:24:00.000Z	Dennis	ikonia	I appreciate the help. You've gotten me further, and helped me to understand more than anyone else has, since this problem arose.
