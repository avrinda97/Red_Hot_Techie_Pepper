2010-10-05T17:23:00.000Z	itmustbejj		I am having some issues with nvidia twinview detecting the proper resolutions for my 2nd monitor. I tried copying the edid of my first (working) monitor but that had no effect. Can anyone take a look at my xorg.conf and offer a suggestion?

2010-10-05T17:25:00.000Z	itmustbejj	gbls	haha the nvidia settings tool is all fubar, I've got no choice but to trudge into the darkness
2010-10-05T17:25:00.000Z	gbls	itmustbejj	have you installed the NVidia driver?
2010-10-05T17:25:00.000Z	itmustbejj	gbls	yeah nvidia-common
2010-10-05T17:26:00.000Z	gbls	itmustbejj	no i mean the serious drivers that you download from the nvidia website?
2010-10-05T17:26:00.000Z	itmustbejj	gbls	I did that previously
2010-10-05T17:28:00.000Z	itmustbejj	gbls	my display was working at one point with the drivers from nvidia's website, but it took some tinkering to get it to work compositing.  Well after my last update that required reboot my nvidia module failed to load and modprobe no longer found it
2010-10-05T17:28:00.000Z	itmustbejj	gbls	at which point I gave the nvidia-common a shot
2010-10-05T17:30:00.000Z	itmustbejj	gbls	ahhhh
2010-10-05T17:30:00.000Z	gbls	itmustbejj	yeah it is a ROYAL pain
2010-10-05T17:30:00.000Z	itmustbejj	gbls	so it wasn't that my previously drivers screwed up...just that I need to reinstall them. Lame
2010-10-05T17:32:00.000Z	itmustbejj	gbls	how do I boot into runlevel 3?
2010-10-05T17:33:00.000Z	itmustbejj	gbls	so I don't have to remove the nvidia-common, I can just install the proprietary one from the website on top of it?
2010-10-05T17:35:00.000Z	gbls	itmustbejj	I think so - the nvidia app should fix it all - if it doesnt work then you need to remove it
2010-10-05T17:41:00.000Z	gbls	itmustbejj	you still there?
