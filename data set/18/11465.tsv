2010-06-21T22:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	joshua_roberts	which versin of Ubuntu?  also is this when your printer is connected to the computer or not?
2010-06-21T22:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	joshua_roberts	 most printers are just well auto detected
2010-06-21T22:06:00.000Z	sebsebseb	joshua_roberts	or loads of them anyway
2010-06-21T22:06:00.000Z	sebsebseb	joshua_roberts	anyway your on 9.10.  if you upgrade to 10.04,  your printer might just work, which printer is it?
2010-06-21T22:07:00.000Z	sebsebseb	joshua_roberts	which card?
2010-06-21T22:07:00.000Z	sebsebseb	joshua_roberts	what kind of issue?

2010-06-21T22:08:00.000Z	sebsebseb	joshua_roberts	theres an issue when it comes to the propritary Nivida driver and Plymouth the boot up
2010-06-21T22:08:00.000Z	sebsebseb	joshua_roberts	is that what you mean? where the boot up looks all well odd?
2010-06-21T22:09:00.000Z	sebsebseb	joshua_roberts	no propritary driver to install in system > administration > hardware drivers?
2010-06-21T22:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	joshua_roberts	ok good :)
