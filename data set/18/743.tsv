2011-10-19T16:05:00.000Z	Anarasha		Every bar has the sign 00 on it when unmuted and MM when muted. But PCM doesn't have either one of those, it's simply blank
2011-10-19T16:05:00.000Z	Anarasha		Do you think that could have anything to say?
2011-10-19T16:07:00.000Z	Anarasha		Hey everyone :) I have a problem. I just upgraded from 11.04 to 11.10. Everything worked fine on 11.04, but on 11.10, my Jack port doesn't seem to work.
2011-10-19T16:07:00.000Z	Anarasha		When I plug something into it, my internal speakers go silent as intended, but whatever I plugged in gives no sound. I run a laptop.
2011-10-19T16:07:00.000Z	Anarasha		Everything in AlsaMixer is unmuted except for PCM which doesn't have that option.
2011-10-19T16:07:00.000Z	rcmaehl	Anarasha	define jack port
2011-10-19T16:08:00.000Z	rcmaehl	Anarasha	can you screenshot your alsamixer?
2011-10-19T16:12:00.000Z	rcmaehl	Anarasha	then hold on while I look something up
2011-10-19T16:13:00.000Z	Anarasha	rcmaehl	- Thanks mate :) Much appreciated
2011-10-19T16:18:00.000Z	rcmaehl	Anarasha	yeah theres a bug report for your card. apparently you're not the only one with that problem with alsa.
2011-10-19T16:19:00.000Z	Anarasha	rcmaehl	Does that mean I should just sit tight and wait for a fix? Or is there something I can do?
2011-10-19T16:19:00.000Z	rcmaehl	Anarasha	you can try a different sound system
2011-10-19T16:19:00.000Z	Anarasha	rcmaehl	What do you mean by sound system? Software? Or do you mean hardware?
2011-10-19T16:21:00.000Z	rcmaehl	Anarasha	it's software but I'm probably not the best guy to walk you through a new sound system instal
2011-10-19T16:24:00.000Z	rcmaehl	Anarasha	no problem
2011-10-19T16:26:00.000Z	rcmaehl	Anarasha	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DowngradeHowto
2011-10-19T16:27:00.000Z	rcmaehl	Anarasha	wait
2011-10-19T16:29:00.000Z	rcmaehl	Anarasha	the fastest way would be a live cd or usb
