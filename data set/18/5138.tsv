2008-12-06T16:48:00.000Z	veltsu		corky, did you get your Atheros to work on 8.04_
2008-12-06T16:49:00.000Z	veltsu		didn't even use madwifi?
2008-12-06T16:49:00.000Z	hc	veltsu	i haven't followed the discussion so far, but i did notice you talked about madwifi. You wouldn't happen to have tried the default madwifi drivers on an atheros card?
2008-12-06T16:49:00.000Z	veltsu		yeah, I did
2008-12-06T16:50:00.000Z	veltsu		they worked to the point that I can see the card and it sees the wireless networks as well but I just cannot connect
2008-12-06T16:50:00.000Z	hc	veltsu	do you happen to know if you have an 5007EG? if so, check this site --> http://www.ubuntugeek.com/atheros-5007eg-with-madwifi-on-i386-platform.html
2008-12-06T16:51:00.000Z	veltsu	hc	thanks. The bottom of my laptop (acer 5100) says AR5BMB5 but when I check it on ubuntu, it's AR2413
2008-12-06T16:51:00.000Z	hc	veltsu	you may want to try that site.
2008-12-06T16:52:00.000Z	veltsu	hc	I suppose I should uninstall the previous madwifi package?
2008-12-06T16:52:00.000Z	hc	veltsu	yes.
2008-12-06T16:52:00.000Z	veltsu		thanks a lot, I might as well try that also. I'll be reporting back in a while :)
2008-12-06T16:59:00.000Z	veltsu	hc	I tried following the instructions on the site but the "sudo make install" doesn't work
2008-12-06T17:00:00.000Z	veltsu		the error report is " No rule to make target 'install' "
2008-12-06T17:01:00.000Z	veltsu	hc	nevermind
2008-12-06T17:01:00.000Z	veltsu		I looked into the folder I untarred and there's only a readme saying that file is obsolete
2008-12-06T17:01:00.000Z	hc	veltsu	sorry. I'm trying to fix a problem of myself so i may not respond very soon.
2008-12-06T17:01:00.000Z	veltsu	hc	no worries, I'll work aroung it and bug somebody else then :)
2008-12-06T17:02:00.000Z	hc	veltsu	I'll help if you need a problem.
