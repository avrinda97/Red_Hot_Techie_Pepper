2011-05-23T07:46:00.000Z	edbian	renosis	Does it look like this: http://fishsoup.net/bib/FileSelectorFosdem2003/gtk-plain.png
2011-05-23T07:47:00.000Z	renosis	edbian	yes very similar
2011-05-23T07:47:00.000Z	edbian	renosis	That is the deprecated file chooser dialog written in gtk.  The developers have to change the app to use the new one (which they really should)  You're just gonna have to deal with it :(
2011-05-23T07:48:00.000Z	renosis	edbian	ok, that's too bad... thanks :]

2011-05-24T06:56:00.000Z	renosis	edbian	I meant...  remember I was here yesterday, asking about my antiquated software that had the old antiquated file browser that didn't allow double clicking? And you showed me a screenshot to verify the file browser? What was the name of that obsolete system?
2011-05-24T07:31:00.000Z	renosis	edbian	what was the name of that file browser you told me that software I was using was using? You know, the antiquated one where you can't double click folders to open them?
2011-05-24T07:32:00.000Z	edbian	renosis	It is the old gtk file chooser dialog
2011-05-24T07:40:00.000Z	renosis	edbian	thanks again
