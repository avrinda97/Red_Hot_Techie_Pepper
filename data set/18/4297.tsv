2009-10-25T22:44:00.000Z	SultansElephant		What's the best format to format an external HD to
2009-10-25T22:45:00.000Z	FreeFull	SultansElephant	I'd say ext3
2009-10-25T22:48:00.000Z	FreeFull	SultansElephant	Windows will read FAT and NTFS, so you might want to use FAT32 if you want better Linux compability. The problem with FAT32 though is that it doesn't support files over 4GB
2009-10-25T22:48:00.000Z	SultansElephant	FreeFull	I'd like to try and troubleshoot what I have right now because I would have transfer abpiut 150 gigs back to a local drive before formatting again
2009-10-25T22:49:00.000Z	FreeFull	SultansElephant	What does df say?
2009-10-25T22:50:00.000Z	FreeFull	SultansElephant	if df -h shows the correct size then don't worry about what file managers say
2009-10-25T22:52:00.000Z	SultansElephant	FreeFull	df http://pastebin.com/d61643e98
2009-10-25T22:52:00.000Z	SultansElephant	FreeFull	df doesn't but disk utility does, mountmanager etc
2009-10-25T22:54:00.000Z	FreeFull	SultansElephant	According to df the partition is 124.5GB big
2009-10-25T22:54:00.000Z	FreeFull	SultansElephant	Maybe disk utility shows the partition as powers of 1000 while df shows as powers of 1024?
2009-10-25T22:55:00.000Z	FreeFull	SultansElephant	Wait, how big was the partition really again?
2009-10-25T22:55:00.000Z	SultansElephant	FreeFull	MountManager sees all 309.3 gigs of the partition
2009-10-25T22:55:00.000Z	FreeFull	SultansElephant	Ah
2009-10-25T22:56:00.000Z	FreeFull	SultansElephant	And the drive is 500 GB?
2009-10-25T22:56:00.000Z	FreeFull	SultansElephant	Well, this is a very strange situation. I'm afraid I can't help. Have you tried asking on the forums?
2009-10-25T22:57:00.000Z	FreeFull	SultansElephant	But considering you need to transfer the data now, it might be else to try asking somebody else here
2009-10-25T22:57:00.000Z	SultansElephant	FreeFull	I suspect MountManager edited something
2009-10-25T22:59:00.000Z	SultansElephant	FreeFull	I'm just going to transfer the data back local and format again with ext3 instead of NTFS
