2007-12-02T23:53:00.000Z	nathan42100		anyone have an Idea as to the answer to my question?
2007-12-02T23:53:00.000Z	nathan42100		"Hey guys, Im trying to install 7.10 server on a few Dell PowerEdge servers 2300-2500 series and the installation hangs at 21% libc6-udeb. Any ideas? I cant find anything on the forums as to an answer"
2007-12-02T23:54:00.000Z	Flannel	nathan42100	this is with the alt CD?  did you check it for defects?
2007-12-02T23:55:00.000Z	Flannel	nathan42100	alt CD can do text-only as well.  But whatever CD, you've checked for defects?
2007-12-02T23:56:00.000Z	Flannel	nathan42100	well, freezing at particular packages (especially consistantly at the same package) really leans towards bad burn.  You might try grabbing the minimal iso, and see if you can install from that (downloads packages from the interblags)
2008-09-20T23:31:00.000Z	Flannel	nathan42100	Do you have space after your 80G partition?
2008-09-20T23:32:00.000Z	nathan42100	Flannel	yes I do
2008-09-20T23:33:00.000Z	Flannel	nathan42100	Go to manual partitioning, and then create the partitions after your 80G one
2008-09-20T23:35:00.000Z	nathan42100	Flannel	I tried that, it yelled at me saying that no root file system was defined
2008-09-20T23:36:00.000Z	Flannel	nathan42100	Once you create the partition, you have to give it a mount point.  That mount point will be / (root), this is for your main OS partition
2008-09-20T23:37:00.000Z	Flannel	nathan42100	How much RAM do you have? and do you plan on hibnernating?
2008-09-20T23:38:00.000Z	Flannel	nathan42100	You need at least 1G of swap then.
2008-09-20T23:38:00.000Z	Flannel	nathan42100	Doesn't matter a whole lot.  With 1G of RAM, you probably will almost never use your swap, except for hibernation
2008-09-20T23:41:00.000Z	Flannel	nathan42100	No, when you format it as "swap" it knows what its doing
2008-09-20T23:41:00.000Z	Flannel	nathan42100	no problem
2009-01-14T09:34:00.000Z	Flannel	nathan42100	It's entirely likely that you can't do the former.  Windows tends to assume its the only OS in the world
2009-01-14T09:36:00.000Z	nathan42100	Flannel	have you tried the supergrub restore?
2009-01-14T09:37:00.000Z	Flannel	nathan42100	I haven't; but it should work more or less the same.
