2012-06-10T13:17:00.000Z	esing		did I understand correctly that when doing a windows 7 / ubuntu dual boot, that installing first windows 7 and then ubuntu results into that the bootloader of ubuntu will overwrite windows 7 bootloader ?
2012-06-10T13:17:00.000Z	esing		hi reisio :D
2012-06-10T13:18:00.000Z	esing		good to know =)
2012-06-10T13:19:00.000Z	esing		Uhm, what if I dont do it reverse but also don't tell ubuntu not install its bootloader, will therefore windows recognize Ubuntu in his bootloader? ^^^
2012-06-10T13:20:00.000Z	esing		*but also tell ubuntu not to install its bootloader***
2012-06-10T13:20:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	esing	the mbr is a easy fix, for repairing windows in general with alive disc having it first on the hd jsut makes things easier.
2012-06-10T13:20:00.000Z	esing	wilee-nilee	so it's like throwing a coin whether to pick windows or ubuntus bootloader?
2012-06-10T13:21:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	esing	no it is totally under your control from the linux side.
2012-06-10T13:22:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	esing	if you want to use easybcd in the ubuntu install do a custom install and put grub in the root or ubuntu partition if it is just one partition
2012-06-10T13:24:00.000Z	esing	wilee-nilee	I just read over a short tutorial and I can run easybcd also from windows?
2012-06-10T13:24:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	esing	easybcd runs in windows only as far as I know.
2012-06-10T13:26:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	esing	I don't think there is a option of no grub in a regular install of Ubuntu, I'm so used to using it maybe I missed that.
2012-06-10T13:27:00.000Z	esing	wilee-nilee	when installing ubuntu you can click on "advanced" and unselect "installing bootloader"
2012-06-10T13:28:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	esing	Ah well since I now a lot about grub it never occurred to me to use a third party and not use grub.
2012-10-06T22:40:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	esing	If you can't figure out the windows bootloader to ubuntu easybcd is used often, but to be honest grub 2 is better but that is my opinion.
2012-10-06T22:40:00.000Z	esing	wilee-nilee	Thanks, I'll consider using easybcd
2012-10-06T22:41:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	esing	Cool, grub 2 though has the os-prober which will auto find other OS's and put them in the grub menu, personally I like that function.
