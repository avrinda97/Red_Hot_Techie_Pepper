2009-09-10T00:03:00.000Z	andcor		nobody compiled linuxwacom ?
2009-09-10T00:04:00.000Z	fccf	andcor	xserver-xorg-input-wacom ???
2009-09-10T00:04:00.000Z	fccf	andcor	that is the package
2009-09-10T00:05:00.000Z	andcor	fccf	I know, but I'm trying to get xinerama working, but it doesn't using the package from the repos
2009-09-10T00:05:00.000Z	andcor	fccf	so I have compiled the 8.4.1 version from sf.org
2009-09-10T00:06:00.000Z	fccf	andcor	of xinerama, or wacom?
2009-09-10T00:06:00.000Z	andcor	fccf	xinerama is a setting in wacom which can be set in both xorg.conf or using xsetwacom
2009-09-10T00:08:00.000Z	andcor	fccf	and now I have actually gotten it correctly set up in xorg.conf for when i'm using two screens, but I can't set it back again without changing the xorg.conf file because xsetwacom is segfaulting
2009-09-10T00:09:00.000Z	fccf	andcor	are you running xsetwacom as root?
2009-09-10T00:09:00.000Z	andcor	fccf	I've tried both
2009-09-10T00:10:00.000Z	fccf	andcor	^^
2009-09-10T00:11:00.000Z	andcor	fccf	yeah it works. I'm not actually running a xinerama setup, just the wacom setting xinerama
2009-09-10T00:13:00.000Z	fccf	andcor	2 screens?
2009-09-10T00:14:00.000Z	andcor	fccf	yeah i have used xrandr to set up a dual screen setup
2009-09-10T00:14:00.000Z	fccf	andcor	I don't think xinerama is an option for wacom ... looking at man wacom ... see twinview there
2009-09-10T00:14:00.000Z	andcor	fccf	and then I use the xinerama setting to force the wacom tablet only to correspond to one screen
2009-09-10T00:15:00.000Z	andcor	fccf	aaah sorry, I remembered the name wrong
2009-09-10T00:15:00.000Z	andcor	fccf	what an idiot I am
