2011-06-23T01:37:00.000Z	admgy22		hi - if I'm a sudoer, can I change into another user?  (something like sudo ___ [otheruser'sname])?
2011-06-23T01:39:00.000Z	admgy22		thanks
2011-06-23T01:39:00.000Z	admgy22		it's the same as sudo su, right?  or is one preferable?
2011-06-23T01:39:00.000Z	admgy22		no I mean "sudo su _user_" versus "sudo -u __user__"
2011-06-23T01:39:00.000Z	admgy22		they're the same (the two commands i just gave) right?
2011-06-23T01:40:00.000Z	jrib	admgy22	no
2011-06-23T01:42:00.000Z	jrib	admgy22	don't do sudo su <user>.  If you want something similar, do: sudo -u user -i
2011-06-23T01:42:00.000Z	admgy22	jrib	could you explain why?
2011-06-23T01:42:00.000Z	jrib	admgy22	what I said, does that
2011-06-23T01:43:00.000Z	jrib	admgy22	it's preferable because you are just running sudo, not su inside sudo.  That's if you want to change to another account as a superuser.  If you just want to login to another account (you know its login credentials), then just do "su - <user>".  But sudo and su simultaneously is kind of silly
2011-06-23T01:44:00.000Z	admgy22	jrib	gotcha
2011-06-23T01:45:00.000Z	jrib	admgy22	« sudo -u USER -i » will log you in as user (and you don't need to know USER's password, but your user must be able to sudo).  « su - USER » logs in as USER (you need to know USER's password).  Both allow you to do what you just said (check history, etc.)
2011-06-28T17:34:00.000Z	jrib	admgy22	read « man sudoers ».  To edit, use « sudo visudo ».  What do you want to do exactly?
2011-06-28T17:35:00.000Z	jrib	admgy22	I've found your original question.  Can you pastebin the contents of your /etc/sudoers?
2011-06-28T17:35:00.000Z	admgy22	jrib	okay... to do that, I shoudl do "sudo visudo", right?
2011-06-28T17:35:00.000Z	jrib	admgy22	if you want.
2011-06-28T17:42:00.000Z	jrib	admgy22	it's usually the "admin" group in ubuntu afaik.  Maybe there's some alternative setup that makes it "sudo" by default.  Anyway, the way /etc/sudoers is now, anyone in the "sudo" group can sudo.  So if you want to remove sudo access for USER, just remove USER from the "sudo" group (use the « deluser USER sudo » command
2011-06-28T17:45:00.000Z	jrib	admgy22	« deluser USER sudo » will remove USER from sudo.  The commands you listed, add a user to the sudo group
