2010-01-23T22:32:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	ikonia	What a delicious polite phrase to kick someone from the channel, I love it...
2010-01-23T22:55:00.000Z	ikonia	Stereocaulon	I believe this was on 8.04 fyi
2010-01-23T22:50:00.000Z	ikonia	Stereocaulon	guys - the channels topic is ubuntu support
2010-01-23T22:51:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	ikonia	OK.
2010-01-23T22:54:00.000Z	ikonia	Stereocaulon	you're not the only one who's had a problem with that, I've seen a bug on launchpad for jp support if you don't select it at install time
2010-01-23T22:54:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	ikonia	thanks do you have a link to that bug?
2010-01-23T22:54:00.000Z	ikonia	Stereocaulon	no, but I'm sure if you search you'll find it
2010-01-23T22:56:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	ikonia	I've used it without problems from Ubu 5.04 all the way up till 9.10
2010-01-23T22:56:00.000Z	ikonia	Stereocaulon	oh really, so it's just 9.10 casuing you the problem
2010-01-23T22:56:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	ikonia	I'm afraid so.
2010-01-23T23:05:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	ikonia	Could you please ban Thermate from this channel, he/ she is harassing me on PM
2010-01-23T23:06:00.000Z	ikonia	Stereocaulon	it's not in the channel any more, join #freenode and speak to staff
2010-01-23T23:06:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	ikonia	I will if Thermate continues.
2012-04-29T14:21:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	ikonia	even your / partition?
2012-04-29T14:22:00.000Z	ikonia	Stereocaulon	sure, lvm can be done on the running system
2012-04-29T14:23:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	ikonia	sounds really nice. Might try that on my next setup.
