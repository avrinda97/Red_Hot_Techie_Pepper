2008-10-03T04:12:00.000Z	airtonix	AnonymousOne	i assume your looking for a application based solution and not something that can be viewed in a webbrowser?
2008-10-03T04:13:00.000Z	AnonymousOne	airtonix	actually I would like to make it into an image for a webpage, but if their are any programs to make a graph that can be viewed in a website, that would work as well
