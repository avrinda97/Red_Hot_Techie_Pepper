2007-04-11T14:12:00.000Z	crimsun	larry	have you compiled alsa-driver yourself?
2007-04-11T13:55:00.000Z	crimsun	larry	it's still supported here.
2007-04-11T13:55:00.000Z	crimsun	larry	pastebin the info requested in the top portion of http://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebuggingSoundProblems, and tell me the url
2007-04-11T14:02:00.000Z	larry	crimsun	http://pastebin.ca/435141
2007-04-11T14:07:00.000Z	crimsun	larry	cat /proc/asound/version
2007-04-11T14:08:00.000Z	larry	crimsun	no such file...
2007-04-11T14:08:00.000Z	crimsun	larry	then the sound driver isn't loaded.
2007-04-11T14:09:00.000Z	crimsun	larry	add `lspci -v` to your pastebin
2007-04-11T14:10:00.000Z	larry	crimsun	http://pastebin.ca/435152
2007-04-11T14:12:00.000Z	larry	crimsun	no, do I need to get the source code?? I just used apt-get
2007-04-11T14:13:00.000Z	crimsun	larry	yes, you do. The version of alsa in breezy is far too old to support your HDA codec.
2007-04-11T14:14:00.000Z	larry	crimsun	I just get stuff from the alsa site then???? thanks a million
2007-04-11T14:48:00.000Z	larry	crimsun	alsa wont compile for me - it says my c compiler cant create executables
2007-04-11T14:49:00.000Z	crimsun	larry	do you have linux-headers-$(uname -r) and build-essential installed?
2007-04-11T14:49:00.000Z	larry	crimsun	not sure
2007-04-11T15:13:00.000Z	larry	crimsun	how do I know the name of my sound card - lspci -v and lshw just seem to list everything as "unknown device"
2007-04-11T15:13:00.000Z	crimsun	larry	sudo update-pciids
2007-04-11T15:21:00.000Z	larry	crimsun	the alsa install readme says I have to run modprobe snd-<name of sound card> I'm not sure exactly what goes here... lspci -v just tells me nVidia Corporation MCP55 High Definition Audio (rev a2)
