2007-01-19T08:33:00.000Z	xover		nice
2007-01-19T08:33:00.000Z	xover		does anyone know how to get coloured konsole's
2007-01-19T08:33:00.000Z	xover		i.e. ls -l produces colored output
2007-01-19T08:34:00.000Z	xover		that allows me to change bg and fg colors
2007-01-19T08:35:00.000Z	mnoir	xover	look in your .bashrc for "enable color support of ls" and uncomment the code there
2007-01-19T08:37:00.000Z	xover	mnoir	there is not ref to color in my bashrc or /etc/bashrc
2007-01-19T08:38:00.000Z	mnoir	xover	what release - 6.10 ?
2007-01-19T08:40:00.000Z	mnoir	xover	i meant ubuntu, not os but that tells me 6.10 (due to generic) -- odd - I have the code in my .bashrc
2007-01-19T08:40:00.000Z	mnoir	xover	try ls --color=auto and say if that works
2007-01-19T08:43:00.000Z	xover	mnoir	that works so does Murchadh.
2007-01-19T08:43:00.000Z	mnoir	xover	what do you mean Murchadh works?
2007-01-19T08:45:00.000Z	mnoir	xover	could you pastebin your .bashrc?  the correct code should have been in it
2007-01-19T08:46:00.000Z	xover	mnoir	which .bachrc.. my ~/ one or the /etc/bashrc
2007-01-19T08:47:00.000Z	mnoir	xover	the one in /etc is without the dot - dots are important - i wanted to see the one in your home, that has a dot :)
2007-01-19T08:49:00.000Z	mnoir	xover	i never recomment changing the /etc one as it is global and you might need it as a guide someday :)
2007-01-19T08:50:00.000Z	xover	mnoir	thanks the problem was that I did not have an alias setup
2007-01-19T08:50:00.000Z	mnoir	xover	k :)
2007-01-19T08:50:00.000Z	xover	mnoir	now just to make vi recognise codes
