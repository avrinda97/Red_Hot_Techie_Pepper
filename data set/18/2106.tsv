2010-08-17T22:32:00.000Z	yashi-	yanick_	looks ok, its practically the same here.
2010-08-17T22:33:00.000Z	yanick_	yashi-	ubuntu uses 2GB or RAM being idle??
2010-08-17T22:33:00.000Z	yanick_	yashi-	that's when I close everything that is running, if I have Chrome and Netbeans open, it jumps to 3.9GB used +1.1GB SWAP
2010-08-17T22:34:00.000Z	yashi-	yanick_	hmm afaik the linux ram management is different it isnt really using it, it just uses what it has (i read that somewhere...)

2010-08-17T22:35:00.000Z	yanick_	yashi-	that's what everyone tell me, however why, then, my hard drive is ALWAYS, constently writing stuff?
2010-08-17T22:36:00.000Z	yashi-	yanick_	well it is curious that it uses the swap partition :/ that shouldnt be unless its necessary
2010-08-17T22:38:00.000Z	yanick_	yashi-	yep. On stackoverflow.com, I have been suggested to do : "sudo sysctl -w vm.swappiness=20" and it seems to improve a little (the default value is 60), what do you think?
2010-08-17T22:38:00.000Z	yashi-	yanick_	actually ive no clue :P i never had that problem
2010-08-17T22:40:00.000Z	yashi-	yanick_	but imo its a ugly solution..it doesnt solve the real problem ...ubuntu shouldnt touch the swap partition at all
2010-08-17T22:41:00.000Z	yanick_	yashi-	I chose Ubuntu especially so I don't have to hack my way around kernel issues (unlike other "compile-yourself" linux distros) so I have no idea how to find/solve this problem
2010-08-17T22:42:00.000Z	yashi-	yanick_	me neither. the point is your ram isnt even used 100% but linux is using the swap partition already strange
2010-08-17T22:43:00.000Z	yanick_	yashi-	or the RAM gets used really really fast, and I have to close everything to finally have some breathing room again
