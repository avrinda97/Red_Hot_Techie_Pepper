2008-01-31T22:35:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	tvrg	Not a good idea..
2008-01-31T22:35:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	tvrg	Winehq will NOT help him if he has used that script
2008-01-31T22:36:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	tvrg	That script does terrible things....
2008-01-31T22:36:00.000Z	tvrg	Jack_Sparrow	 have you read the script?
2008-01-31T22:36:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	tvrg	I have seen what it does, and I have talked with them in winehq about it.. something to avoid
2008-01-31T22:37:00.000Z	tvrg	Jack_Sparrow	getting a manual setup working as nice is a pain too
2008-01-31T22:37:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	tvrg	IE is seriously something to avoid
2008-01-31T22:37:00.000Z	tvrg	Jack_Sparrow	I agree, but he asked and did sound like a nube
2008-01-31T22:38:00.000Z	tvrg	Jack_Sparrow	so i suggested the easy way, the one he'll get working
2008-01-31T22:38:00.000Z	tvrg	Jack_Sparrow	I set it up using vanilla wine etc, cuz i need it for testing
2008-01-31T22:39:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	tvrg	You suggested a way that will break his wine install and cause him NOT to get help with wine in the future
2008-01-31T22:41:00.000Z	tvrg	Jack_Sparrow	how will it break his wine install if it doesn't need root?
2008-01-31T22:41:00.000Z	tvrg	Jack_Sparrow	I'm not suggesting you are wrong
2008-01-31T22:41:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	tvrg	This is all ot here... go ask that in winehq
2008-01-31T22:42:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	tvrg	Suggesting ie4linux in here would be like #winehw telling people to use automatix...
2008-01-31T22:43:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	tvrg	And I told you to ask in winehw about it
2008-01-31T22:44:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	tvrg	DROP IT
2008-01-31T22:44:00.000Z	tvrg	Jack_Sparrow	you wan't me to stop suggesting it but can't give me a reason, WTF
