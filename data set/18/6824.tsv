2008-11-13T21:16:00.000Z	ackbahr		Hi guys! To test 8.10, I installed it alongside 8.04 and when I was certain it worked, I upgraded 8.04 to 8.10. The problem is that the upgraded one can't display properly. So can I export some settings from the working 8.10 onto the non-working one?
2008-11-13T21:16:00.000Z	Yuji1	ackbahr	...I'd rather fresh install than that..
2008-11-13T21:17:00.000Z	ackbahr	Yuji1	Yes, but I have many other settings, you know....
2008-11-13T21:17:00.000Z	Yuji1	ackbahr	As did/do I.
2008-11-13T21:17:00.000Z	Yuji1	ackbahr	What specifically is the problem?
2008-11-13T21:18:00.000Z	ackbahr	Yuji1	When I boot, it tells me it cannot configure the display so do I want to reconfigure it myself? When I say "yes" nothing happens....
2008-11-13T21:18:00.000Z	Yuji1		Ah I had that problem.
2008-11-13T21:18:00.000Z	Yuji1		Check your menu.lst in grub to see if you're using the latest kernel.
2008-11-13T21:18:00.000Z	Yuji1		I told it to keep my old kernel and well, Nvidia hated it.
2008-11-13T21:19:00.000Z	ackbahr	Yuji1	[17:18] <Yuji1> Check your menu.lst in grub to see if you're using the latest kernel. ==> Is this for me?
2008-11-13T21:19:00.000Z	Yuji1		Ubuntu, yes?
2008-11-13T21:19:00.000Z	Yuji1		So update to the latest kernel, make sure your menu.lst is updated to it, log on (it may ask to configure graphics, continue in low graphics) install latest nvidia, done. Shutdown restart.
2008-11-13T21:19:00.000Z	Yuji1		Thats how I got it to work.
2008-11-13T21:21:00.000Z	ackbahr	Yuji1	Thanks!
2008-11-13T21:21:00.000Z	Yuji1	ackbahr	Worked?
2008-11-13T21:21:00.000Z	ackbahr	Yuji1	Not tried yet, but that's already something to try! :)
2008-11-13T21:22:00.000Z	ackbahr		So long folks!
