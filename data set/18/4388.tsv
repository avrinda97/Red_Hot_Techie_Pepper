2009-08-24T13:03:00.000Z	nibbler	nmvictor	you can mount -obind one folder to a subfolder of the other, you can make hard- or softlinks the files to the other folder
2009-08-24T13:03:00.000Z	nibbler	nmvictor	or do oyu want to delete those files in your home folder which you have on cdrom?
2009-08-24T13:05:00.000Z	nmvictor	nibbler	something like that, but a preview will be good,maybe with grep or something
2009-08-24T13:05:00.000Z	nibbler	nmvictor	diff /media/cdrom /other/location
2009-08-24T13:10:00.000Z	nmvictor	nibbler	that worked, so how about deleting them?
2009-08-24T13:12:00.000Z	nibbler	nmvictor	well, i'd find /home/bla -exec if [ -e /media/cdrom/'{}`] ; then do rm /home/bla/'{}'; done \;     or something like this
2009-08-24T13:13:00.000Z	nibbler	nmvictor	also you could grep the diff output and xarg it to delete the dupes
2009-08-24T13:13:00.000Z	nibbler	nmvictor	if you want to find dupes, even if the name changed, use md5sum on the files and compare the output
2009-08-24T13:14:00.000Z	nmvictor	nibbler	mind pasting the two commands,my terminal does not support copy paste,id appreciate
2009-08-24T13:15:00.000Z	nibbler	nmvictor	they are not finished, or tested, and they include a "rm" command. read them, understand them, and modify them to fit your needs
2009-08-24T13:18:00.000Z	nmvictor	nibbler	are you sending them
2009-08-24T13:19:00.000Z	nibbler	nmvictor	they are not meant to be copy/pasted, as they are untested etc
2009-08-24T13:19:00.000Z	nmvictor	nibbler	how about sending them as files directly?
2009-08-24T13:22:00.000Z	nibbler	nmvictor	http://paste.ubuntu.com/258520/
2009-08-24T13:24:00.000Z	nmvictor	nibbler	thanks
2009-08-24T13:33:00.000Z	nmvictor	nibbler	not working, some syntax errors
