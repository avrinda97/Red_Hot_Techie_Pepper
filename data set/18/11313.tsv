2006-08-14T13:54:00.000Z	madc		has anyone observed an error with firefox/folck (any gecko based browser) locking the system up when viewing png's?
2006-08-14T13:55:00.000Z	madc		absolutly
2006-08-14T13:55:00.000Z	madc		I've tried strace
2006-08-14T13:55:00.000Z	madc		but it doesnt write the output file until its ended
2006-08-14T13:55:00.000Z	madc		any png.
2006-08-14T13:55:00.000Z	madc		specifcly
2006-08-14T13:55:00.000Z	madc		when you try to view a png in a new tab.
2006-08-14T13:57:00.000Z	madc		tried ssh into the machine and redirecting strace to that vtty, but as soon as it starts to view the png it locks, including my remote shell
2006-08-14T13:58:00.000Z	madc		not yet, though thats my next stop.  It seems to hard lock the entire machine, goes dead on the network..etc
2006-08-14T13:58:00.000Z	mcphail	madc	no such problem here
2006-08-14T14:00:00.000Z	mcphail	madc	i did occasionally have problems with my old laptop, firefox, ndiswrapper and the binary ati driver.
2006-08-14T14:01:00.000Z	madc	mcphail	I use wlan_ng , and the Xorg ati driver
2006-08-14T14:03:00.000Z	mcphail	madc	anything in the logs?
2006-08-14T14:04:00.000Z	mcphail	madc	have you checked your RAM etc?
2006-08-14T14:08:00.000Z	mcphail	madc	have you checked your ram? Firefox is noted to have memory leaks aplenty, and may be putting your system under a bit of strain
2006-08-14T14:08:00.000Z	madc	mcphail	I actrualy ran memtest86
2006-08-14T14:10:00.000Z	mcphail	madc	have you tried firefox from the mozilla site?
2006-08-14T14:10:00.000Z	madc	mcphail	not yet, Im going to reimage the drive and see what happens, it was fine for a few weeks then started this morning
