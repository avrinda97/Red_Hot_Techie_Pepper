2006-11-22T13:41:00.000Z	ktrauberman		Have there been any reported issues with getting the ipw3945 wireless card working in edgy?
2006-11-22T13:41:00.000Z	ktrauberman		hmm
2006-11-22T13:41:00.000Z	ktrauberman		i installed network-manager-gnome
2006-11-22T13:41:00.000Z	ktrauberman		and it doesn't list any wireless network support at all
2006-11-22T13:42:00.000Z	ktrauberman		and when i use the built-in network monitor, with a manual ssid, it won't connect either
2006-11-22T13:42:00.000Z	ktrauberman		even to an open network
2006-11-22T13:42:00.000Z	ktrauberman		i'll try wpasupplicant

2006-11-22T13:44:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	ktrauberman	if the driver isn't loaded, the interface isn't up and nm has nothing to manage, nm has nothing to do with loading the driver
2006-11-22T13:44:00.000Z	ktrauberman	Kingsqueak	The driver is loaded I think
2006-11-22T13:45:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	ktrauberman	if you do 'ifconfig -a'
2006-11-22T13:45:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	ktrauberman	you see eth1 or wlan0 etc?
2006-11-22T13:45:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	ktrauberman	k
2006-11-22T13:46:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	ktrauberman	;-)
2006-11-22T13:47:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	ktrauberman	nm also requires that /etc/network/interfaces has nothing setup but the 'lo interface
2006-11-22T13:47:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	ktrauberman	it takes over all your network setup for you
2006-11-22T13:48:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	ktrauberman	if you installed ndis and it's a 3945, remove ndis too
2006-11-22T13:48:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	ktrauberman	ipw3945 is a plain kernel module
