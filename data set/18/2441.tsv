2010-06-09T01:44:00.000Z	lighta	mfpcokets	xrandr --output VGA1 --mode 720x264 (if this mode exist on your card)
2010-06-09T01:45:00.000Z	lighta	mfpcokets	oups not VGA1 probably LVDS1
2010-06-09T01:45:00.000Z	mfpcokets	lighta	isnt 720p 1368*720 ?
2010-06-09T01:46:00.000Z	mfpcokets	lighta	my res is 1920*1080 now, but when i play the file im getting lots of lost frames like the netbook cannot handle it.  they didnt work in windows without a plugin installed which reduced the sys requirements for 720p vids
2010-06-09T01:48:00.000Z	lighta	mfpcokets	just run command xrandr this will display mode you can have on your card
