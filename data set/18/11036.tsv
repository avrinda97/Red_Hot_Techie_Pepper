2006-09-23T07:57:00.000Z	Skarr		Help! I reinstalled windows after I accidently deleted it, so now I am making a dual boot for ubuntu and windows, but how do I rename my windows hard drive to C:\?
2006-09-23T07:58:00.000Z	sethk	Skarr	it has to be your IDE primary master
2006-09-23T08:02:00.000Z	sethk	Skarr	there is a reassign drive id function in windows
2006-09-23T08:03:00.000Z	sethk	Skarr	I think you'll find it in the disk manager tool, but I'm not a windows expert
2006-09-23T08:26:00.000Z	sethk	Skarr	indeed, windows is a royal PITA
2006-09-23T08:26:00.000Z	sethk	Skarr	can't you reinstall your nvidia driver so it thinks it is drive d:, or whatever?
2006-09-23T08:26:00.000Z	Skarr	sethk	why do you think i got ubuntu ;)
2006-09-23T08:27:00.000Z	Skarr	sethk	no when I open the exe it says "drive c doesnt exist"
2006-09-23T08:27:00.000Z	sethk	Skarr	you mean the install program says that?
2006-09-23T08:27:00.000Z	Skarr	sethk	yes
2006-09-23T08:27:00.000Z	sethk	Skarr	hmm.  I don't have an answer for that, at least not off the top of my head.
2006-09-23T08:32:00.000Z	sethk	Skarr	first of all, who said it is "supposed" to be better?  it is different
2006-09-23T08:32:00.000Z	sethk	Skarr	if you want something that doesn't require learning, go with osx
2006-09-23T08:32:00.000Z	Skarr	sethk	No, I like it. It's just that I guess it has a steep learning curb?
2006-09-23T08:39:00.000Z	sethk	Skarr	same answer, for some flavors and platforms of unix
2006-09-23T08:49:00.000Z	sethk	Skarr	it's an emulator.  why shouldn't it run under windows?
2006-09-23T08:50:00.000Z	Skarr	sethk	 WHy would someone need to run a windows emulator under windows?
2006-09-23T12:08:00.000Z	sethk	Skarr	usually
