2008-10-11T10:34:00.000Z	pist0l-fish		hi all I am installing (x)ubuntu on a machine that has separate home and / partitions. I have gone to Manual partitioner and have told it to use the old / partition as the new xubuntu partition and have said "don't use this partition" for my old /home. Will this work?
2008-10-11T10:35:00.000Z	pist0l-fish		anyone?

2008-10-11T10:36:00.000Z	pist0l-fish		thanks for your help
2008-10-11T10:36:00.000Z	pist0l-fish		argh. Always forget that I'm on IRC and attempt to use IM emoticons. Strange.
2008-10-11T10:36:00.000Z	airtonix	pist0l-fish	just point it there in setup but dont format that partition
2008-10-11T10:37:00.000Z	pist0l-fish	airtonix	I don't think I can point it in the setup without formatting the partition
2008-10-11T10:37:00.000Z	airtonix	pist0l-fish	you can...i do it all the time
2008-10-11T10:37:00.000Z	pist0l-fish	airtonix	hmm let me take a closer look
2008-10-11T10:37:00.000Z	pist0l-fish	airtonix	is the xubuntu manual partitioner different than the ubuntu one?
2008-10-11T10:38:00.000Z	airtonix	pist0l-fish	ah yes it may be...
2008-10-11T10:39:00.000Z	airtonix	pist0l-fish	unfortunatly i dont have xubuntu hardy iso here to load up in virtual box to confirm...sorry
2008-10-11T10:39:00.000Z	airtonix	pist0l-fish	yep you got it! :)
2008-10-11T10:39:00.000Z	pist0l-fish	airtonix	Thanks for even considering doing that :D I think I've figured it out
2008-10-11T10:39:00.000Z	pist0l-fish	airtonix	I can't believe i missed that >_<
2008-10-11T10:42:00.000Z	pist0l-fish	airtonix	i already have a directory /home/<user> . On ubuntu, if you choose your username to be <user>, it won't do anything silly like rm -r /home/<user> and then mkdir /home/<user>, will it? It'll just create a user, right?
2008-10-11T10:43:00.000Z	airtonix	pist0l-fish	hasnt done that for me
2008-10-11T10:43:00.000Z	pist0l-fish	airtonix	okay good stuff :)
