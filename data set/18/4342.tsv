2010-03-15T02:09:00.000Z	DrDank		Can someone give a newbie some help? second day using Ubuntu.. now Im stuck.
2010-03-15T02:10:00.000Z	DrDank		I clicked 'Advanced' in the appearence preferences.. Now the dialog box is 'locked' I need to get it closed some how.. I heard something about rkill or kill in the terminal.. how do i reference it to this dialog box?
2010-03-15T02:12:00.000Z	DrDank		AndChat, I just type xkill in the terminal and it will auto close the Appereance Preferences and nothing else?
2010-03-15T02:12:00.000Z	DrDank		oh
2010-03-15T02:12:00.000Z	DrDank		thats badass..
2010-03-15T02:13:00.000Z	DrDank		I like that.. *takes note of xkill*
2010-03-15T02:13:00.000Z	DrDank		oh wait.
2010-03-15T02:13:00.000Z	DrDank		it still didnt go away
2010-03-15T02:14:00.000Z	VCoolio	DrDank	xkill changes your mouse cursor into a hitman, click the window to kill
2010-03-15T02:14:00.000Z	DrDank	VCoolio	I did.. but the damn window just came back.. The Appearance Preferences.
2010-03-15T02:14:00.000Z	DrDank		I clicked 'Advanced' in the appearence preferences.. Now the dialog box is 'locked' I need to get it closed some how.. I heard something about rkill or kill in the terminal.. how do i reference it to this dialog box?
2010-03-15T02:14:00.000Z	DrDank		besides the rkill and kill subjects* sorry I just pressed up instead of retyping.

2010-03-15T02:15:00.000Z	DrDank	VCoolio	, that didnt work neither..
2010-03-15T02:15:00.000Z	DrDank		I think im going to have to reboot..
2010-03-15T02:15:00.000Z	DrDank		nothing seems to be working. lol
2010-03-15T02:15:00.000Z	VCoolio	DrDank	kill -9 $(pidof gnome-appearance-properties)
2010-03-15T02:16:00.000Z	VCoolio	DrDank	logout - login when needed; reboot only necessary with kernel update or really bad crash
