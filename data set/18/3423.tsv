2009-10-17T03:48:00.000Z	The_Doctor	mgv2	Have you checked the audio settings to see if you have the correct device?
2009-10-17T03:50:00.000Z	mgv2	The_Doctor	yes but what should i do there?
2009-10-17T03:51:00.000Z	The_Doctor	mgv2	Keep trying different ones until one, hopefully, works.
2009-10-17T03:51:00.000Z	mgv2	The_Doctor	and if not :)?
2009-10-17T03:52:00.000Z	The_Doctor	mgv2	I don't know.
2009-10-17T03:52:00.000Z	The_Doctor	mgv2	But I found I have always had to go throught the list to find one that would work for me.
2009-10-17T03:53:00.000Z	mgv2	The_Doctor	what field is for the microphone?
2009-10-17T03:53:00.000Z	mgv2	The_Doctor	should i reset something or go to skype right after?
2009-10-17T03:53:00.000Z	The_Doctor	mgv2	I don't have it on this machine so I can't check it out.
2009-10-17T03:54:00.000Z	The_Doctor	mgv2	I think it remembers the last setting.
2009-10-17T03:55:00.000Z	mgv2	The_Doctor	how do i test?
2009-10-17T03:55:00.000Z	The_Doctor	mgv2	Use the test call. You should be able to hear yourself and the response.
2009-10-17T03:56:00.000Z	mgv2	The_Doctor	im testing - thanks
2009-10-17T03:59:00.000Z	mgv2	The_Doctor	nothing changes
