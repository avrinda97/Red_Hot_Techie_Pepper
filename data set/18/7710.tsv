2009-08-29T22:13:00.000Z	zamba		i have a laptop with a hotkey for enabling and disabling the wlan radio.. how do i get that working?
2009-08-29T22:14:00.000Z	zamba		if you have a physical switch button, then it's no problem, because the hardware is detached.. but with a button it's up to the software to remove the drivers and such, right?
2009-08-29T22:14:00.000Z	codazoda	zamba	That gives me an idea for mine.  I could assign a hot key to modprobe the card.  You could also, although it might not be the "special" key.
2009-08-29T22:16:00.000Z	codazoda		Zamba: You might find it in System, Preferences, Keyboard Shortcuts.  Add a new one for you wifi.  I put the command "sudo modprobe ath_pci" there and assigned it to CTRL-W.
2009-08-29T22:17:00.000Z	codazoda		Zamba: Your special key might work too.  To make it smart, you might have to write a shell script to turn it on or off depending on current state.
2009-08-29T22:17:00.000Z	zamba	codazoda	yeah
2009-08-29T22:18:00.000Z	zamba	codazoda	but my primary focus is to save battery power and "radio noise"
2009-08-29T22:18:00.000Z	zamba	codazoda	so i'm not sure if that's enough for that.. just removing the module, i mean
2009-08-29T22:18:00.000Z	codazoda	zamba	Yeah, I think that would do it.
2009-08-29T22:19:00.000Z	codazoda	zamba	I don't know for sure, but I imagine the WiFi card is "off" if the module is removed.
2009-08-29T22:19:00.000Z	zamba	codazoda	how do i check which module the interface uses?
2009-08-29T22:20:00.000Z	zamba		oh.. iwlagn.. that's the module
2009-08-29T22:20:00.000Z	codazoda	zamba	I don't remember.  Someone here will probably know how to list active modules though.
2009-08-29T22:21:00.000Z	zamba	codazoda	didn't work removing the module, it seems.. i still have the light on the laptop indicating that it's in use
2009-08-29T22:21:00.000Z	codazoda	zamba	lsmod
2009-08-29T22:22:00.000Z	zamba	codazoda	yeah, i know that.. and i have removed what i think is the module..
2009-08-29T22:22:00.000Z	codazoda	zamba	I actually have 5 different related modules.  Wonder if removing all of them would do the trick.
2009-08-29T22:22:00.000Z	zamba	codazoda	i tried the same :)
