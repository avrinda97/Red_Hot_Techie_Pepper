2011-09-13T19:24:00.000Z	rblst		hello, i have a ZTE mobile 3G modem, it came with Join Air, the connect software by ZTE; i installed Join Air and now i cannot use NetworkManager/MobileManager with my modem to connect to the internet; anyone having experience with this?
2011-09-13T19:25:00.000Z	SNSK	rblst	i have similar problem
2011-09-13T19:26:00.000Z	SNSK		i use my 3g connection to connect to internet using pon method, it seems that network manager does not understand that network is connected, and shows a dimond implying not connected
2011-09-13T19:26:00.000Z	rblst	SNSK	great, that makes two of us :)
2011-09-13T19:27:00.000Z	SNSK	rblst	so like me you also cannot use evolution
2011-09-13T19:28:00.000Z	rblst	SNSK	i understand that Join Air uses wvdial which is essentially the same as pon/poff
2011-09-13T19:29:00.000Z	SNSK	rblst	see i have same problem as you, my network manager shows me no connections, even though i can surf
2011-09-13T19:29:00.000Z	rblst		SNKS, what i do not understand is what is changed so that NetworkManager/ModemManager fails to use my modem
2011-09-13T19:30:00.000Z	rblst	SNSK	i checked syslog and usb_modeswitch does its thing but then modem manager remains dead silent when it should come in and do its thing
2011-09-13T19:31:00.000Z	SNSK	rblst	i cannot understand that
2011-09-13T19:32:00.000Z	rblst		SNKS, i have been searching the web far and wide, but couldn't really find anything useful
2011-09-13T19:32:00.000Z	SNSK	rblst	same here, i am dying to use evoluytion back
2011-09-13T19:33:00.000Z	SNSK		rblst,
2011-09-13T19:33:00.000Z	SNSK	rblst	i use 11.04 you ?
2011-09-13T19:33:00.000Z	rblst	SNSK	something must be blocking NetworkManager, i just can't find what is
2011-09-13T19:34:00.000Z	rblst	SNSK	i am using 11.04, too; but i had the same problem with older distros as well
2011-09-13T19:34:00.000Z	SNSK		but atleast you can connect to net
2011-09-13T19:37:00.000Z	SNSK	rblst	let's see if we can get any help here
