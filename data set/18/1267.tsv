2011-04-29T09:09:00.000Z	jubei	ChronicSyncope	I'm also trying to get compiz to work
2011-04-29T09:09:00.000Z	ChronicSyncope	jubei	I have compiz working. are you in classic or unity?
2011-04-29T09:09:00.000Z	jubei	ChronicSyncope	unity
2011-04-29T09:10:00.000Z	jubei	ChronicSyncope	when I select additional hardware drivers it shows me that the nvidia driver isn't enabled but also has no way for me to enable it
2011-04-29T09:10:00.000Z	ChronicSyncope	jubei	does it say "activated but not in use" or is the little circle red?
2011-04-29T09:10:00.000Z	jubei	ChronicSyncope	yes
2011-04-29T09:10:00.000Z	jubei	ChronicSyncope	sec
2011-04-29T09:11:00.000Z	ChronicSyncope	jubei	activated but not in use? that means it's working. but if the light is red, it's not working. I don't know how to solve the not-working problem myself, but i'm sure somebody here has some ideas
2011-04-29T09:11:00.000Z	jubei	ChronicSyncope	says "This driver is activated but not currently in use", and the circle is green
2011-04-29T09:11:00.000Z	ChronicSyncope	jubei	thats how mine looks, and compiz is working for me.
2011-04-29T09:11:00.000Z	jubei	ChronicSyncope	but I don't get my old effects.
2011-04-29T09:12:00.000Z	jubei	ChronicSyncope	and under "Appearance" there's no option to enable effects
2011-04-29T09:12:00.000Z	ChronicSyncope	jubei	install ccsm
2011-04-29T09:12:00.000Z	jubei	ChronicSyncope	ok.
