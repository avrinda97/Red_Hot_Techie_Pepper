2008-12-15T04:53:00.000Z	trollboy		So I've a buddy with about 20 computers, and about 6 different models between them.  They're all running windows for a custom windows app he needs.  I've taken one of his spare computers, put ubuntu on it, and ported the custom software to php running on localhost.   Currently he manages all his PC's with GoToMyPC as they are all on NAT's and can not direct-connect to the internet.  I'd like to create a dvd of a disk image, and replace

2008-12-15T04:53:00.000Z	trollboy		how doable is this?
2008-12-15T04:54:00.000Z	trollboy		I'm thinking a ghosted image of the HDD should work
2008-12-15T04:54:00.000Z	trollboy		and ubuntu is smart enough to get around the hardware changes
2008-12-15T04:55:00.000Z	trollboy		but how do I replicate the GoToMyPC functionality?
2008-12-15T04:55:00.000Z	trollboy		due to space concerns he's got some of the machines at his mom and uncle's house
2008-12-15T04:56:00.000Z	trollboy		so "Stick it in and walk away" is a necessity
2008-12-15T04:56:00.000Z	trollboy		that's not really my issue
2008-12-15T04:56:00.000Z	trollboy		I'm more concerned with the GotoMyPC style functionality
