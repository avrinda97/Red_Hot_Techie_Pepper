2010-02-13T23:56:00.000Z	lupescu		everything seems ok in sshd_config
2010-02-13T23:57:00.000Z	lupescu		what exactly should i be looking for ? the settings are the ownes from ssh_config but "applied"
2010-02-13T23:59:00.000Z	lupescu		what other things might make ssh ask for a password if the keys are ok, permissions good, and aparently setting file ok ?
2010-02-13T23:59:00.000Z	jrib	lupescu	most likely, one of those things is not true
2010-02-14T00:00:00.000Z	lupescu	jrib	: how can i limit those 3 ?
2010-02-14T00:00:00.000Z	jrib	lupescu	try adding some -v when you connect and check sshd's log
