2009-04-20T13:06:00.000Z	cylonia1		Ubuntu 8.10 - Lost wired networking and keyboard on 2 laptops after installing updates yesterday .. using live CD now and i was wondering how to start debugging the issue ? Obviously without keyboard running diagnostic terminal commands is impossible .. quite lost, TIA for all pointers.
2009-04-20T13:07:00.000Z	Jordan_U	cylonia1	What was updated?
2009-04-20T13:08:00.000Z	cylonia1	Jordan_U	not 100% sure, but i believe it were some pulseaudio related packages ..
2009-04-20T13:09:00.000Z	Jordan_U	cylonia1	Can you use the keyboard in recovery mode?
2009-04-20T13:10:00.000Z	cylonia1	Jordan_U	no doesn't work in recovery mode either
2009-04-20T13:11:00.000Z	Jordan_U	cylonia1	Are you chatting from the same computer?
2009-04-20T13:12:00.000Z	cylonia1	Jordan_U	yes, booted from live CD to get internet connection working
2009-04-20T13:15:00.000Z	Jordan_U	cylonia1	Can you boot the other laptop in recovery mode and try pressing "alt+sysrq+r" ?
2009-04-20T13:15:00.000Z	cylonia1	Jordan_U	will try and report back, give me a few minutes .. and thanks :)
2009-04-20T13:19:00.000Z	cylonia1	Jordan_U	okay, that worked, got keyboard in recovery mode thx
2009-04-20T13:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	cylonia1	Try continuing booting and see if the keyboard and mouse continue to work in X
2009-04-20T13:21:00.000Z	cylonia1	Jordan_U	ok, trying that
2009-04-20T13:24:00.000Z	cylonia1	Jordan_U	negative, laptop keyboard still not working in X, usb mouse does work though
2009-04-20T13:25:00.000Z	Jordan_U	cylonia1	Does alt+sysrq+r get the keyboard working again in X?
2009-04-20T13:26:00.000Z	cylonia1	Jordan_U	nope, and no network either, looks like i will need to go for a re-install ,
2009-04-20T13:28:00.000Z	cylonia1	Jordan_U	thanks for your help, got to get to work, bye
2009-04-20T13:28:00.000Z	Jordan_U	cylonia1	First try "sudo dpkg --configure -a" in case the upgrade didn't finish ( not likely on two machines but it can't hurt to try )
2009-04-20T13:29:00.000Z	cylonia1	Jordan_U	okay, i'll keep looking in the forums and on launchpad for related bugs etc... have a nice day and thx again
