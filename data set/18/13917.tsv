2006-06-01T13:23:00.000Z	jah_raztah		how do i use the dapper cd to install dapper instead of repository?
2006-06-01T13:24:00.000Z	jah_raztah		i don't wish to do a fresh install
2006-06-01T13:26:00.000Z	jah_raztah		i'm already on dapper but i have the beta version of xubuntu now i wish to switch to ubuntu so i downloaded the dapper cd and would now like to use that cd to install ubuntu-desktop but it will only allow me to use the repositories... how can i set it to use the cd-rom?
2006-06-01T13:27:00.000Z	soundray	jah_raztah	add this line add the beginning of /etc/apt/sources.list: deb cdrom:[Ubuntu 6.06 _Dapper Drake_ - Alpha i386 (20060329.1)] / dapper main restricted
2006-06-01T13:27:00.000Z	soundray	jah_raztah	you'll have to adapt the CD name in there.
2006-06-01T13:29:00.000Z	jah_raztah	soundray	finally some one responds and yes i've done that already... i'm not a newbie... but this makes no sens ei added the cd to the repositories already using synaptic and the method u stated earlier and neither worked... when i goto look for packages ubuntu-desktop it says not found
2006-06-01T13:29:00.000Z	soundray	jah_raztah	did you run 'sudo apt-get update' after the change?
2006-06-01T13:30:00.000Z	jah_raztah	soundray	it's very weird i'm not new to ubuntu either... i could use the repositories but i don't want to waste the bandwidth
2006-06-01T13:32:00.000Z	soundray	jah_raztah	is your CD mounted?
2006-06-01T13:32:00.000Z	soundray	jah_raztah	unmount it and run apt-get update again, see if that helps.
2006-06-01T13:34:00.000Z	jah_raztah	soundray	no it doesn't
2006-06-01T13:35:00.000Z	soundray	jah_raztah	when you mount the CD, can you find the package? 'find /media/cdrom0 -name ubuntu-desktop\*.deb'
2006-06-01T13:37:00.000Z	soundray	jah_raztah	have you done an md5sum on the CD btw?
2006-06-01T13:37:00.000Z	jah_raztah	soundray	no i have not i download the the official torrent file from ubuntu website and once it finished downloading i burnt it
2006-06-01T13:38:00.000Z	jah_raztah	soundray	you are right there is no package named ubuntu-desktop on the cdrom as well
2006-06-01T13:40:00.000Z	jah_raztah	soundray	should i just forget about using the cd-rom and just use the repositories to install the packages?
2006-06-01T13:41:00.000Z	soundray	jah_raztah	depends... if you're paying per MB, I would check the md5sums first (on the image file AND on the CD)
2006-06-01T13:42:00.000Z	soundray	jah_raztah	if you're only concerned about your impact on the web, I think you can safely assume it's okay to download a gig or so.
