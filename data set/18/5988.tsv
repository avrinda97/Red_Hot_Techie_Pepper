2008-07-19T22:11:00.000Z	thenotsoemokid		I'm trying to do an XP dual boot, both are installed and in grub, but it won't boot XP, says it cannot find kernel
2008-07-19T22:12:00.000Z	Whitor	thenotsoemokid	add any disks lately ?
2008-07-19T22:13:00.000Z	Whitor		vlc is very good
2008-07-19T22:13:00.000Z	thenotsoemokid		no... everything is just the same.  I just resized the Ubuntu partition, installed XP on it, and got it into the grub menu
2008-07-19T22:13:00.000Z	Whitor	thenotsoemokid	how did you get it into your grub menu ?
2008-07-19T22:14:00.000Z	Whitor	thenotsoemokid	anychance you can post your menu.lst in a pastebn website ?
2008-07-19T22:14:00.000Z	thenotsoemokid		sure
2008-07-19T22:15:00.000Z	thenotsoemokid	Whitor	can you link me to a pastebin?  I've never used one before

2008-07-19T22:18:00.000Z	thenotsoemokid		thx
2008-07-19T22:19:00.000Z	Whitor	thenotsoemokid	are you certan the  winxp install is on the 2nd partition ?
2008-07-19T22:19:00.000Z	thenotsoemokid		well, the xp install read the partition between the ubuntu partition and the swap space
2008-07-19T22:20:00.000Z	Whitor	thenotsoemokid	a quick trial and error thing to do would be to 'e' the line in grub and change the 1 to 2 then 3 then 4 ... just incase its hanging out on some weird partition number
2008-07-19T22:20:00.000Z	Whitor	thenotsoemokid	let me check my menu.lst
2008-07-19T22:21:00.000Z	thenotsoemokid	Whitor	K, thanks.  I'll be back on in a bit if I can't get that working
