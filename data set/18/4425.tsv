2011-06-09T00:03:00.000Z	kacheng		either way, open synaptic
2011-06-09T00:05:00.000Z	kacheng		hang on
2011-06-09T00:06:00.000Z	kacheng		is it just the translation files that don't download?
2011-06-09T00:07:00.000Z	kacheng		yeah, maybe your repository was down for a bit, and now it's back.  happens sometimes
2011-06-09T00:08:00.000Z	kacheng		just alter your download from server to see if a different mirror is working better
2011-06-09T00:08:00.000Z	kacheng		next time
2011-06-09T00:09:00.000Z	kacheng		The install process may have downloaded updates already
2011-06-09T00:10:00.000Z	kacheng		you can test by installing chrome-browser or something like that.
2011-06-09T00:11:00.000Z	kacheng		try a different repository server - perhaps a university close to you
2011-06-09T00:11:00.000Z	kacheng		Anyone had problems with wifi connection recently on Natty?
2011-06-09T00:11:00.000Z	celthunder	kacheng	chipset/modules being used/network manager used?
2011-06-09T00:13:00.000Z	celthunder	kacheng	do you have the ipw firmware
2011-06-09T00:14:00.000Z	kacheng	celthunder	no - tell me more please/
2011-06-09T00:14:00.000Z	celthunder	kacheng	apt-get install ipw2000-firmware or whatever..i'm fiarly sure that chipset needs it
2011-06-09T00:15:00.000Z	kacheng	celthunder	was actually working fine until today for the last month, but I'll try reinstalling that package
2011-06-09T00:26:00.000Z	kacheng	celthunder	that package ipw2200-firmware doesn't seem to exist? I found firmware on sourceforge, but it says that the drivers have been merged to the kernel and no longer maintained on sourceforge by intel
2011-06-09T00:27:00.000Z	celthunder	kacheng	ok then was just an idea
2011-06-09T00:29:00.000Z	kacheng	celthunder	thanks - existing driver seems okay.  but just doesn't want to connect to my router.
