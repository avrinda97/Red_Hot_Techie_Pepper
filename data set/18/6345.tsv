2008-06-06T02:32:00.000Z	dkt	ali_	do you dual boot to windows?
2008-06-06T02:33:00.000Z	ali_	dkt	yeh but when i boot windows i get the hal.dll system 32 error
2008-06-06T02:34:00.000Z	dkt	ali_	ok well windows is stored in a different partition than linux... suggestion go google mounting ntfs partitions...
2008-06-06T02:35:00.000Z	dkt	ali_	basically you are going to have to call mount -t ntfs device mountpoint
2008-06-06T02:36:00.000Z	dkt	ali_	then you will be able to navigate from your c drive in windows starting at mountpoint
2008-06-06T02:40:00.000Z	ali_	dkt	ok im doin the mount thing and it says to look for ntfs its not there in my trminal
