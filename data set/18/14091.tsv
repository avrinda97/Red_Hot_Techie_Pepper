2007-04-07T10:40:00.000Z	kelsey435		I am trying to install ubuntu for the first time ever, first linux for that matter, and i am having problems.  Can someone walk me through the inital set up?
2007-04-07T10:41:00.000Z	Flannel	kelsey435	it's best to just ask about whatever issue you're having.    However,
2007-04-07T10:41:00.000Z	Flannel	kelsey435	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/  At the beginning there there's three/four steps,  (gettiung, burning, integrity check, then the installatin guide)
2007-04-07T10:41:00.000Z	Flannel	kelsey435	that'll be more informative (and less forgetful) than anyone here can be.  If you still have questions, feel free to ask
2007-04-07T12:14:00.000Z	Flannel	kelsey435	You have 10GB of boot?
2007-04-07T12:20:00.000Z	Flannel	kelsey435	Why do you have a 10gb /boot?
2007-04-07T12:24:00.000Z	Flannel	kelsey435	10gb? wow.  You won't need more than a 512MB boot.  Ever.  And even that might be overkill
2007-04-07T12:25:00.000Z	Flannel	kelsey435	alright, so, let's reinstall, shall we?  See if we can't figure out your partitioning error, at that.
2007-04-07T12:25:00.000Z	Flannel	kelsey435	do you have the alternate or the desktop CD?
2007-04-07T12:25:00.000Z	Flannel	kelsey435	yeah.  which ISO did you download and burn?
2007-04-07T12:26:00.000Z	Flannel	kelsey435	right.  6.10, but "Desktop" or "alternate"?
2007-04-07T12:26:00.000Z	Flannel	kelsey435	right. So, desktop.  Ok.  (Alternate isn't server, by the way)
2007-04-07T12:28:00.000Z	Flannel	kelsey435	alternate CD is a text based install (instead of the GUI one), that is usually more stable and robust.
2007-04-07T12:28:00.000Z	Flannel	kelsey435	right.  Sounds good.
2007-04-07T12:28:00.000Z	Flannel	kelsey435	Alternate CD isnt on the main download page, for some random reason.
2007-04-07T12:28:00.000Z	Flannel	kelsey435	so, start the install, and when you get to partitioning, let me know
2007-04-07T12:30:00.000Z	Flannel	kelsey435	alright.  So, you want /boot on a separate partition, anything else?  /home? or anything?
