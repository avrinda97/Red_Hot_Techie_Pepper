2008-02-05T17:07:00.000Z	r45c41		i am trying to run a perl file but i am getting this error
2008-02-05T17:07:00.000Z	r45c41		r45c4l@r45c4l-desktop:~/Desktop$ ./test.pl
2008-02-05T17:07:00.000Z	r45c41		bash: ./test.pl: usr/bin/perl^M: bad interpreter: No such file or directory
2008-02-05T17:07:00.000Z	r45c41		can any one help plz
2008-02-05T17:08:00.000Z	ali1234	r45c41	maybe you meant /usr/bin/perl
2008-02-05T17:08:00.000Z	r45c41	ali1234	n
2008-02-05T17:08:00.000Z	r45c41	ali1234	i save it on deskotp as test.pl
2008-02-05T17:09:00.000Z	r45c41	ali1234	ok
2008-02-05T17:10:00.000Z	ali1234	r45c41	the script is looking for usr/bin/perl which is relative path, you need absolute path (assuming you copied the error correctly). edit the first line. also use dos2unix to get rid of the ^M
2008-02-05T17:14:00.000Z	r45c41	ali1234	i installed tofrodos and after that i gave the command dos2unix test.pl
2008-02-05T17:15:00.000Z	ali1234	r45c41	that only converts the file's line endings from dos format to unix format
2008-02-05T17:16:00.000Z	r45c41	ali1234	r45c4l@r45c4l-desktop:~/Desktop$ ./test.pl
2008-02-05T17:16:00.000Z	ali1234	r45c41	so, edit the first line of the script and put / before usr/bin/perl
2008-02-05T17:17:00.000Z	r45c41	ali1234	plz consider i am just using linux from past 2 weeks
2008-02-05T17:17:00.000Z	r45c41	ali1234	: ok
2008-02-05T17:18:00.000Z	r45c41	ali1234	thanks man my prog worked,
2008-02-05T17:18:00.000Z	r45c41	ali1234	: thanks a lot :)
