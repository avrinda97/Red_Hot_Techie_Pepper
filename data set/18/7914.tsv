2008-01-26T12:29:00.000Z	Ashfire908		how would i search files for a given string, like grep does, but just output the file matched and not the text line matched?
2008-01-26T12:30:00.000Z	timob	Ashfire908	grep -l
2008-01-26T12:31:00.000Z	timob		gutsy has disappointed me too
2008-01-26T12:31:00.000Z	Ashfire908		can i pipe files to be deleted to rm?
2008-01-26T12:32:00.000Z	timob	Ashfire908	you could use command substitution or xargs ...
2008-01-26T12:32:00.000Z	Ashfire908		(i'm cleaning out my irc logs of pm floods/spam)
2008-01-26T12:32:00.000Z	Ashfire908	timob	so no?
2008-01-26T12:33:00.000Z	timob	Ashfire908	it there a few files you could do rm $(grep -l mysearchstring *)
2008-01-26T12:34:00.000Z	Ashfire908	timob	i'm passes the filenames to grep from find -exec
2008-01-26T12:35:00.000Z	timob	Ashfire908	you could use a  for loop ....
2008-01-26T12:36:00.000Z	timob	Ashfire908	you could use -print in find to only print when grep returns true
2008-01-26T12:38:00.000Z	Ashfire908	timob	huh?
2008-01-26T12:39:00.000Z	Ashfire908	timob	you know the thing to tell find to have the filename not have something in the name?
2008-01-26T12:40:00.000Z	timob	Ashfire908	find ! -name 'mystring'
2008-01-26T12:40:00.000Z	Ashfire908		k
2008-01-26T12:41:00.000Z	timob		or myglobstring
2008-01-26T12:42:00.000Z	Ashfire908	timob	i don't know much about bash's functions, do i have to escape !
2008-01-26T12:43:00.000Z	timob	Ashfire908	no ! does not need to be escaped, here is an example ... find ! -name '*.txt'
