2008-05-31T19:09:00.000Z	Condrad		hi i'm new to linux and was wondering what the advantages of ubuntu are vs the other distributions
2008-05-31T19:09:00.000Z	Condrad		what comes "out of the box" with ubuntu?
2008-05-31T19:09:00.000Z	philsf	Condrad	what do you need?
2008-05-31T19:11:00.000Z	philsf	Condrad	are you familiar with package tasks? there are tasks that auto-selects bundles for those things
2008-05-31T19:12:00.000Z	Condrad	philsf	i'm not familiar with package rasks, are you refering to edubuntu and kbuntu?
2008-05-31T19:13:00.000Z	philsf	Condrad	no, those are derivative distributions
2008-05-31T19:14:00.000Z	philsf	Condrad	basically, there are bundles to auto-select packages for webserver, dns server, file server, printer server, etc
2008-05-31T19:14:00.000Z	Condrad	philsf	ok, so if I install ubuntu do I have to establish package tasks, effectively ticking off the things I want?
2008-05-31T19:14:00.000Z	philsf	Condrad	yes
2008-05-31T19:15:00.000Z	Condrad	philsf	excellent,  is the cd iso image I am downloading now going to prompt me?
2008-05-31T19:15:00.000Z	philsf	Condrad	which one are you downloading?
2008-05-31T19:15:00.000Z	philsf	Condrad	not the desktop one, I presume?
2008-05-31T19:16:00.000Z	Condrad	philsf	8.04 desktop 1386
2008-05-31T19:16:00.000Z	Condrad	philsf	yes
2008-05-31T19:16:00.000Z	philsf	Condrad	you can install anything with any installation disk, but those bundles are not "out of the box" for a desktop
2008-05-31T19:17:00.000Z	philsf	Condrad	but the metapackages make it easy enough for you to select bundles without having to know the packages you need previously
2008-05-31T19:18:00.000Z	Condrad	philsf	ok I think I am getting you, I have been a linux "user" of websrevers for a while so i kind of know the basics, but I have never had to "choose" a distribution before and i'm kind of stuck here on my own so thanks for your advice
2008-05-31T19:19:00.000Z	philsf	Condrad	of course, if you already know the programs you need (in your case, apache, mysql, etc) it's even easier. I don't think it makes much difference from one distro to another
