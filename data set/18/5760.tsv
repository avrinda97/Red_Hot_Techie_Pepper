2009-05-26T04:20:00.000Z	pH	Ampelbein	Any idea?
2009-05-26T04:21:00.000Z	Ampelbein	pH	so you want it to look like? ' blodoipphone Promo code: ....'?
2009-05-26T04:21:00.000Z	Ampelbein	pH	ok, second please
2009-05-26T04:38:00.000Z	Ampelbein	pH	i'm near it. awk -F'>' '/<(screen_name)>/ { print $2 } /<(text)>/ { print "\n"$2 }' friends_timeline.xml | cut -d'<' -f1
2009-05-26T04:39:00.000Z	Ampelbein	pH	it pairs text and screen_name and adds line break
2009-05-26T04:40:00.000Z	Ampelbein	pH	you could check if that's the desired output
2009-05-26T04:42:00.000Z	Ampelbein	pH	and please don't shout, i'm not hearing impaired ;-)
2009-05-26T04:42:00.000Z	Ampelbein	pH	glad that's working now
2009-05-26T04:42:00.000Z	Ampelbein	pH	i could not understand what you wanted to achieve in the first place, but after you explaining it some times i got it ;-)
