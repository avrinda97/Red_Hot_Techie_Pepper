2005-12-22T10:15:00.000Z	angsty		yeah I guess I could fiddle around with that stuff
2005-12-22T10:15:00.000Z	angsty		it's a pain though :|
2005-12-22T10:15:00.000Z	angsty		in the initial flurry of debug info, it appears to be detecting all the drives
2005-12-22T10:17:00.000Z	angsty		er, does that mean I can't use ubuntu at all if I use the pci->ide card?
2005-12-22T10:17:00.000Z	angsty		because that's not really an option.
2005-12-22T10:17:00.000Z	angsty		or is it just during install
2005-12-22T10:18:00.000Z	angsty		hm
2005-12-22T10:18:00.000Z	angsty		ok
2005-12-22T10:18:00.000Z	angsty		well, I'm trying to get a dual-boot situation here
2005-12-22T10:18:00.000Z	angsty		at least until ubuntu has stable ntfs rw support
2005-12-22T10:20:00.000Z	Madpilot	angsty	MS owns NTFS...
2005-12-22T10:20:00.000Z	angsty		even just auto-detecting of my drives and read-only support would be fine
2005-12-22T10:20:00.000Z	angsty		and I know it can handle read-only 'cause I did it before, just involved a lot of terminal ugliness
2005-12-22T10:21:00.000Z	angsty		is too
2005-12-22T10:21:00.000Z	angsty		it's not 1970 anymore
2005-12-22T10:21:00.000Z	angsty	sethk	ok
2005-12-22T10:21:00.000Z	angsty		I guess I'll try
2005-12-22T10:21:00.000Z	Madpilot	angsty	there's a script somewhere that'll mount NTFS automagicially, I think - I'm Windows free, so I haven't looked into it
