2007-04-12T12:19:00.000Z	MikeyMike		hey can anyone tell me what dhclient does? i have no earthly idea what its for.. but my girlfriend uses it to get her usb-wifi device working in edgy.... she claims someone told her to just run dhclient and it will magically fix everything... well it works.... but sometimes dhclient binds her to random ip's.... can someone explain what dhclient is .....
2007-04-12T12:19:00.000Z	MikeyMike		i know what dhcp is......
2007-04-12T12:20:00.000Z	MikeyMike		how does dhclient have the authority to assign an ip inside a router's network?
2007-04-12T12:20:00.000Z	MikeyMike		its NOT the router.....
2007-04-12T12:21:00.000Z	MikeyMike		ok so basically she has more than one dhcp enabled router or pc assigning ip's.... (it's a network mess)
2007-04-12T12:22:00.000Z	MikeyMike		how can you make it force to a router
2007-04-12T12:22:00.000Z	MikeyMike		is there any way to force dhclient to look at one server?
2007-04-12T12:22:00.000Z	Pici	MikeyMike	Is it a wireless adapter?
2007-04-12T12:25:00.000Z	Pici	MikeyMike	Maybe we dont get what you are asking then..
2007-04-12T12:26:00.000Z	Pici	MikeyMike	dhclient will only work if you're already associated with an SSID.
2007-04-12T12:27:00.000Z	Pici	MikeyMike	Which sounds like she isnt.  `sudo iwconfig eth1 essid "essidname"`
2007-04-12T12:27:00.000Z	Pici	MikeyMike	Where eth1 is the name of the adapter
2007-04-12T12:27:00.000Z	MikeyMike	Pici	 rasub0
2007-04-12T12:28:00.000Z	Pici	MikeyMike	So, it would be `sudo iwconfig rausb0 essid "whateveryouressidis"`
2007-04-12T12:28:00.000Z	Pici	MikeyMike	Then `sudo dhclient rausb0`
2007-09-13T05:18:00.000Z	Pici	MikeyMike	try ##mac
2007-09-13T05:18:00.000Z	Pici	MikeyMike	You need to /join ##mac   This channel here is only for Ubuntu support.
2007-09-13T05:19:00.000Z	MikeyMike	Pici	 thanks i did
