2011-04-21T08:19:00.000Z	Osmodivs		Hello. I turned off the sound option in the BIOS, the sound manager detects my sound card, I can only open a music file thru the right button and then choosing VLC -TOTEM AND RYHTMBOX won't work, not even if double click the fiele. - Why cant I hear any sound?? Yes, I checked A,LSAMIXER
2011-04-21T08:20:00.000Z	KM0201	Osmodivs	well, if you turned the sound off in your bios, why would you expect it to work?
2011-04-21T08:21:00.000Z	Osmodivs	KM0201	Because that't for the onboard sound, NOT the PCI Soundcard
2011-04-21T08:21:00.000Z	KM0201	Osmodivs	oh ok.
2011-04-21T08:21:00.000Z	Osmodivs	KM0201	.......
2011-04-21T08:21:00.000Z	KM0201	Osmodivs	just out of curiosity, if you enable the onboard sound, and plug in there.. does it work?
2011-04-21T08:22:00.000Z	KM0201	Osmodivs	or did you try that?
2011-04-21T08:22:00.000Z	Osmodivs	KM0201	Nope. It is just strange, it was working a few days ago...
2011-04-21T08:23:00.000Z	KM0201	Osmodivs	is everything set properly in Sound Preferences, to use the sound card, and not the onboard
2011-04-21T08:23:00.000Z	Osmodivs	KM0201	I have even tried different combinations in the sound manager, like Analog Stereo Duplex in HARDWARE, and Analog Output/ NO Amplifier in the OUTPUT, but no,no sound at all
2011-04-21T08:25:00.000Z	KM0201	Osmodivs	that seems kinda logical.. i was gonna ask if you've ruled out a hardware issue.
2011-04-21T08:26:00.000Z	Osmodivs	KM0201	Well, the other strange thing is that the files wont open in TOTEM, I have to open them with right Mouse Button and choose VLC
2011-04-21T08:26:00.000Z	KM0201	Osmodivs	thats not really that unusual.. right click, choose properties, click "open with"  and select totem.. just somehow your default program for music got changed
2011-04-21T08:27:00.000Z	Osmodivs	KM0201	No, really, TOTEM will open, but wont play anything
2011-04-21T08:27:00.000Z	KM0201	Osmodivs	i think your issue is hardware related, does your machine dual boot?
2011-04-21T08:28:00.000Z	Osmodivs	KM0201	No dual Boot
2011-04-21T08:29:00.000Z	Osmodivs	KM0201	Pure Ubuntu 10.10 64bit since 9.04LTS
2011-04-21T08:29:00.000Z	KM0201	Osmodivs	well, 9.04 wasn't LTS(I assume you mean 8.04).. i honestly don't know what could be wrong... i'd think hardware to be truthful
