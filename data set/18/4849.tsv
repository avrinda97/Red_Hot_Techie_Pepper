2009-01-28T21:24:00.000Z	rdw200169	ahmed123	that might be ssh-agent
2009-01-28T21:25:00.000Z	ahmed123	rdw200169	do you know how I can delete keys from ssh-agent? I cant see any relevant options i nhelp
2009-01-28T21:25:00.000Z	rdw200169	ahmed123	well, if you don't want it to store keys, i think that's in the ssh config somewhere
2009-01-28T21:26:00.000Z	rdw200169	ahmed123	look in /etc/ssh/ssh_config and ~/.ssh
2009-01-28T21:26:00.000Z	ahmed123	rdw200169	tried those, no joy :(
2009-01-28T21:26:00.000Z	rdw200169	ahmed123	in ~/.ssh, if there's a agent-<hostname> file there
2009-01-28T21:27:00.000Z	rdw200169	ahmed123	that points to the ssh-agent that's storing the keys
2009-01-28T21:27:00.000Z	ahmed123	rdw200169	all I have in .ssh is id_rsa and known_hosts
2009-01-28T21:27:00.000Z	ahmed123	rdw200169	i think you're right. I'll keep searching. thanks
2009-01-28T21:27:00.000Z	rdw200169	ahmed123	you could uninstall ssh-agent
2009-01-28T21:28:00.000Z	rdw200169	ahmed123	and see if that helps; also, gnome-keyring might be involved
2009-01-28T21:28:00.000Z	ahmed123	rdw200169	thanks, I hadn't thought of that, I'll give it a try
2009-01-28T21:28:00.000Z	rdw200169	ahmed123	i can't remember how to find out what keys gnome is storing; lemme see
2009-01-28T21:32:00.000Z	rdw200169	ahmed123	you could try deleting ~/.gnome2/keyrings/login.keyring
2009-01-28T21:33:00.000Z	ahmed123	rdw200169	I didn't try that in case it's related to my login password ...?
2009-01-28T21:33:00.000Z	rdw200169	ahmed123	i'm pretty sure that's where NetworkManager stores the wireless keys, i don't know what else is in there
2009-01-28T21:33:00.000Z	rdw200169	ahmed123	your password for login is in /etc/shadow, so don't worry about it
2009-01-28T21:34:00.000Z	ahmed123	rdw200169	thanks! I'll give it a try
