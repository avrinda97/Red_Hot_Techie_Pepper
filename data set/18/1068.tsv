2011-06-13T02:05:00.000Z	ljhr05	DasEi	Intel Corporation Mobile 945GM/GMS, 943/940GML Express Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 03)
2011-06-13T02:07:00.000Z	DasEi	ljhr05	there have been some improvements in the younger kernel line for it, and so it comes integrated , which kernel are you running ?
2011-06-13T02:07:00.000Z	DasEi	ljhr05	uname -r tells you
2011-06-13T02:08:00.000Z	ljhr05	DasEi	 2.6.38-8-generic
2011-06-13T02:09:00.000Z	DasEi	ljhr05	with that you should be fine, is there a certain issue you have ?
2011-06-13T02:10:00.000Z	ljhr05	DasEi	well I just wanted to be sure.. you know what is the command to test the 3D drivers? ...the one that use a cube cap.. dont remember well
2011-06-13T02:12:00.000Z	DasEi	ljhr05	you could try glxgears from mesa-utils
2011-06-13T02:13:00.000Z	ljhr05	DasEi	302 frames in 5.0 seconds = 60.317 FPS is good?
2011-06-13T02:16:00.000Z	DasEi	ljhr05	for an integrated chip, I don't use gma, maybe ask this directly to someone doing so to have a check, 64k ain't bad
2011-06-13T02:20:00.000Z	DasEi	ljhr05	give me a minute, I recently found something on gma500 on the wiki, have to find it back
