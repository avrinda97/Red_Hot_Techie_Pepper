2005-12-30T12:29:00.000Z	eobanb	korptix	it doesnt, there's a ram disk
2005-12-30T12:30:00.000Z	eobanb	korptix	what are you trying to compile?
2005-12-30T12:46:00.000Z	eobanb	korptix	this is a USB flash drive:
2005-12-30T12:55:00.000Z	eobanb	korptix	a less-safe option would be to live-partition the drive with a tool like partitionmagic
2005-12-30T12:57:00.000Z	eobanb	korptix	no matter what, you will need to partition your drive, unless you have another hard drive on hand.
2005-12-30T12:58:00.000Z	eobanb	korptix	the ubuntu liveCD is not the same as the install CD.
2005-12-30T12:59:00.000Z	eobanb	korptix	yes, you do.
