2010-04-13T18:10:00.000Z	Pici	derek__	Yep, still looking at it.
2010-04-13T18:26:00.000Z	Pici	derek__	Good news and bad news:  Bad: Looks like lots of people have issues compiling this module from source. Good: It should be included in a new kernel release. Bad: Not the one thats shipping with Lucid. Good: you can probably use ndiswrapper instead Bad: You might have issuses connecting to some secure networks.
