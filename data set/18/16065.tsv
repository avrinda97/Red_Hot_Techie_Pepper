2004-11-18T15:20:00.000Z	jonex		I have just done half of the installation of ubuntu, but as i didn't want it to owerwrite my bootloader i now need to know what i should put in my grub.conf. Anybody know?'
2004-11-18T15:21:00.000Z	seacyd	jonex	you can always put it into the ubuntu root and modify your original boot loader
2004-11-18T15:21:00.000Z	jonex	seacyd	Hmm, too late :/
2004-11-18T15:22:00.000Z	jonex		Does it use another kernel on the first boot? Should I use "vmlinuz-2.6.8.1-3-386"
2004-11-18T15:22:00.000Z	jonex		?
2004-11-18T15:23:00.000Z	seacyd	jonex	which partition is it on?
2004-11-18T15:24:00.000Z	jonex	seacyd	What? I have grub on hdb6, where i also want to put all my kernels. I have ubuntu on hdb8.
2004-11-18T15:25:00.000Z	seacyd	jonex	so I would try this: root (hd1,7)
2004-11-18T15:25:00.000Z	jonex	seacyd	Yes, but wich kernel?
2004-11-18T15:26:00.000Z	seacyd	jonex	my line is kernel /boot/vmlinuz-2.6.8.1-3-386 root=/dev/hda6 ro quiet splash
2004-11-18T15:28:00.000Z	jonex	seacyd	But is that right for the first boot? What is "initrd.img-2.6.8.1-3-386" for?
2004-11-18T15:29:00.000Z	seacyd	jonex	keep that line as well, it works for me
2004-11-18T15:30:00.000Z	jonex	seacyd	That's not a line. It's a file in /boot om the ubuntu partition :/
2004-11-18T15:31:00.000Z	seacyd	jonex	basically copy the grub.conf entry on your ubuntu partition
2004-11-18T15:32:00.000Z	jonex	seacyd	I have none.
2004-11-18T15:32:00.000Z	jonex	seacyd	I thought it would owerwrite my mbr if i tried to install. That'd be annoying.
2004-11-18T15:33:00.000Z	jonex		And people said that ubuntu would be easy. :(
2004-11-18T15:34:00.000Z	seacyd	jonex	I am not sure how to open a private channel, I would like to send you the 4 lines there
