2011-10-26T11:31:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	s0nee	i'm trying to replace the default window manager to compiz :)
2011-10-30T15:01:00.000Z	s0nee	Flynsarmy	Shirakawasuna fallback to gnome 3 is like unity 2d to unity
2011-10-30T15:03:00.000Z	s0nee	Flynsarmy	Shirakawasuna to gnome shell i mean
2011-10-30T15:03:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	s0nee	you wouldn't happen to know how to set compiz to be the default window manager in gnome-session-fallback would you? I ended up moving /usr/bin/metacity and softlinking compiz *hangs head in shame*
2011-10-30T15:04:00.000Z	s0nee	Flynsarmy	no i use awesome instead ...
2011-10-30T15:04:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	s0nee	well how did you change to awesome as default?
2011-10-30T15:04:00.000Z	s0nee	Flynsarmy	theres a method that uses gconf-tool
2011-10-30T15:05:00.000Z	s0nee	Flynsarmy	gconf-editor
2011-10-30T15:05:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	s0nee	do you happen to know whereabouts in gconf-editor? or could point me to a tutorial
2011-10-30T15:06:00.000Z	s0nee	Flynsarmy	you mean how to set default wm or a general guide ?
2011-10-30T15:06:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	s0nee	setting default WM
2011-10-30T15:07:00.000Z	s0nee	Flynsarmy	open gconf-editor then go to /desktop/gnome/session/required_components . theres an entry called "windowmanager" in there
2011-10-30T15:08:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	s0nee	is this 11.10? /desktop/gnome has no session folder
2011-10-30T15:08:00.000Z	s0nee	Flynsarmy	dont know if it still works. i use gnome shell as default then switch to awesome
2011-10-30T15:09:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	s0nee	creating teh folders and field won't explode my system if i give it a shot?
2011-10-30T15:10:00.000Z	s0nee	Flynsarmy	the computer wont explode but that will have no effect
2011-10-30T15:13:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	s0nee	that's interesting. the folder ~/.gconf/desktop/gnome/applications/window_manager already exists with a %gconf.xml file in it with the correct window manager. this doesn't appear in gconf-editor though. any ideas why?
2011-10-30T15:13:00.000Z	s0nee	Flynsarmy	sorry but idk about those stuffs
