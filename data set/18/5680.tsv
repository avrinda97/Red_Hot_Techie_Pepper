2008-09-09T13:37:00.000Z	MorpheusX[NL]		i have set up / installed rsync on ubuntu and what i want to do is to pull data from this ubuntu machine from windows xp. does anyone know how to this
2008-09-09T13:39:00.000Z	MorpheusX[NL]		on ubuntu
2008-09-09T13:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MorpheusX[NL]	do you have the server or client installed?
2008-09-09T13:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MorpheusX[NL]	rsync maybe?
2008-09-09T13:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MorpheusX[NL]	or you could samba share the linux folder
2008-09-09T13:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MorpheusX[NL]	simple then, samba share the files and map a network drive
2008-09-09T13:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MorpheusX[NL]	then enable offline files, when you log off, you will take a copy
2008-09-09T13:43:00.000Z	MorpheusX[NL]	ActionParsnip	enable offline files
2008-09-09T13:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MorpheusX[NL]	next time you log in you wll see whats new and update as needed so the server is always uptodate
2008-09-09T13:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MorpheusX[NL]	no, youll have a cached set of files on your windows system, when you log off it'll be made local but the system will think its remote
2008-09-09T13:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MorpheusX[NL]	when you log in the chanegs (as someone said about last touched) will update onto the server

2008-09-09T13:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MorpheusX[NL]	this can take a while if you have lots of data so keep it as slim as possible
2008-09-09T13:47:00.000Z	MorpheusX[NL]	ActionParsnip	previously we used rdiff but this tool pulls complete files while rsync pulls fragments. So I think if i am going to us sftp i think i run into the same problem off large files
2008-09-09T13:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MorpheusX[NL]	indeed
2008-09-09T13:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MorpheusX[NL]	if windows is pulling the files over id ask in ##windows\
2008-09-09T13:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MorpheusX[NL]	as the linux system is accessible and ok, you just need some windows software to pull the data over
