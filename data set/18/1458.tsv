2011-03-12T05:41:00.000Z	recognosco	muji	- see if you can connect to the distro mirrors
2011-03-12T05:42:00.000Z	recognosco	muji	with like simple wget
2011-03-12T05:42:00.000Z	recognosco	muji	edit the file /etc/resolv.conf
2011-03-12T05:43:00.000Z	recognosco	muji	add a line like - nameserver x.x.x.x
2011-03-12T05:44:00.000Z	recognosco	muji	replace x.x.x.x with your dns server's IP
2011-03-12T05:45:00.000Z	recognosco	muji	your vps
2011-03-12T05:45:00.000Z	recognosco	muji	the problem is there, right? ;)
2011-03-12T05:47:00.000Z	recognosco	muji	try this - nslookup ubuntu.com
2011-03-12T05:48:00.000Z	muji	recognosco	it says bash: nslookup: command not found
2011-03-12T05:49:00.000Z	recognosco	muji	ping google.com then?
2011-03-12T05:56:00.000Z	recognosco	muji	did you edit /etc/resolve.conf and add that nameserver?
2011-03-12T05:57:00.000Z	muji	recognosco	i tried but it wouldn't like even open it up
2011-03-12T06:00:00.000Z	recognosco	muji	what text editor are you using?
2011-03-12T06:02:00.000Z	recognosco	muji	in the vps command line type this: sudo echo "nameserver 96.8.113.13" > /etc/resolv.conf
