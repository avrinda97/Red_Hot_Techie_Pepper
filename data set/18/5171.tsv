2008-12-22T15:49:00.000Z	tiyowan		Okay, this is interesting. Before installing Storage Device Manager, I could use the fdisk -l and vol_id commands. After installing SDM and configuring two volumes, both fdisk and vol_id return the error: Cannot open /dev/sda. Running Intrepid.
2008-12-22T15:51:00.000Z	_2	tiyowan	just a thought on that,  check if the owner or group changed for the device
2008-12-22T15:52:00.000Z	tiyowan	_2	Excellent idea. Hang on.
2008-12-22T15:55:00.000Z	tiyowan	_2	Thanks for the tip. "sudo fdisk -l" returns the info. I think SDM took over my drive. :)
2008-12-22T15:56:00.000Z	_2	tiyowan	yes it probably changed the group for the device   you can  ls -l /dev/sda    and add the group to your user account
2008-12-22T15:57:00.000Z	_2	tiyowan	i personally don't like the idea of users being able to access raw devices tho,  it's a security hole
2008-12-22T15:58:00.000Z	tiyowan	_2	Yep. Changed the group to "disk". Thanks, mate. Yeah, that's what I'm thinking. Whether to keep SDM or not; because the way it is right now, it's quite good that it prevents me from accidentally doing some sort of dmg.
2008-12-22T16:21:00.000Z	_2	tiyowan	yes they move the packages to oldreleases.ubuntu.com  i think that's the spelling anyway
2008-12-22T16:37:00.000Z	tiyowan	_2	This is good info. Thanks.
2008-12-22T16:37:00.000Z	_2	tiyowan	welcome
2008-12-22T16:47:00.000Z	tiyowan	_2	Is dbus running? ps auxww | grep dbus
2008-12-22T16:48:00.000Z	_2	tiyowan	yes
2008-12-22T16:49:00.000Z	tiyowan	_2	Intrepid?
2008-12-22T16:49:00.000Z	_2	tiyowan	dapper
2008-12-22T16:51:00.000Z	tiyowan	_2	Hmm. Maybe check whether you have the dbus packages as listed on http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-146868.html?
2008-12-22T16:55:00.000Z	_2	tiyowan	maybe libdbus-1-cil  am getting now.
2008-12-22T16:56:00.000Z	tiyowan	_2	I'm not 100% sure this will fix epiphany, but I think it's worth a shot.
2008-12-22T16:57:00.000Z	_2	tiyowan	libdbus-1-cil was the only one that i didn't already have
