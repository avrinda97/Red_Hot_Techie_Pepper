2009-07-10T07:22:00.000Z	Strider		I have a stange issue with the sound controls. I'm trying to use skype with a headset (directly connected to the sound card).
2009-07-10T07:23:00.000Z	Strider		I have it working in sound recorder and to a certain extent in skype, but I can barely get "hello" out before alsamixer turns the capture volume to a barely audible level.
2009-07-10T07:23:00.000Z	Strider		Any ideas why it would continuously turn the sound down?
2009-07-10T07:23:00.000Z	Strider		I don't think I have an auto-adjust button.
2009-07-10T07:24:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	Strider	It's a bug.
2009-07-10T07:25:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	Strider	Try "sudo alsactl init"
2009-07-10T07:25:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	Strider	initialize driver to a default state.
2009-07-10T07:26:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	Strider	Also, do "sudo alsactl store" after that.
2009-07-10T07:27:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	Strider	It's a bug.
2009-07-10T07:27:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	Strider	New Ubuntu installation or not, it's a bug.
2009-07-10T07:35:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	Strider	Sound working?
2009-07-10T07:35:00.000Z	Strider	mobi-sheep	Nope.
2009-07-10T07:37:00.000Z	Strider	mobi-sheep	It reset the alsa configuration, as expected, but the problem still persists.
2009-07-10T07:38:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	Strider	alsamixer -- you set up all bars up?
2009-07-10T07:41:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	Strider	Try "sudo alsactl init"  --- No storing this time.
2009-07-10T07:43:00.000Z	Strider	mobi-sheep	That seemed to have worked somewhat.
2009-07-10T07:44:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	Strider	Change it with alsamixer.  Don't use store.  See if that helps.
2009-07-10T07:45:00.000Z	Strider	mobi-sheep	Nope. No luck. sudo alsamixer in the terminal. Turned it all the way up.
