2009-03-02T21:16:00.000Z	corey		How do you get an iBook to boot from cd
2009-03-02T21:17:00.000Z	Jean_	corey	You need to press a key during the boot of the computer (I think it is T or C)
2009-03-02T21:17:00.000Z	corey		jean_:thanks I will try that now
2009-03-02T21:20:00.000Z	Jean_	corey	Have you a Mac or Intel version of Ubuntu ? And is it a iBook or a MacBook (more recent version with Intel processor) ?
2009-03-02T21:21:00.000Z	corey		jean_: i am using a PPC install disk
2009-03-02T21:21:00.000Z	corey	Jean_	it is an iBook
2009-03-02T21:23:00.000Z	corey	Jean_	is there website or IRC dedicated to running ubuntu on iBook
2009-03-02T21:23:00.000Z	Jean_	corey	Then it must be the 'C' touch that you need to push during the booting of the computer (push a very long time to be sure).
2009-03-02T21:23:00.000Z	Jean_	corey	I don't know about a IRC
2009-03-02T21:24:00.000Z	corey	Jean_	I tryed pressing C and nothing happend
2009-03-02T21:24:00.000Z	corey		jean_: when I hold the option button the backlight wont turn on and I see an icon
2009-03-02T21:25:00.000Z	corey	Jean_	if i press enter it proceeds to boot from hdd
2009-03-02T21:26:00.000Z	Jean_	corey	Then there is probably an error with the Ubuntu display because I think that the first line of the boot menu of Ubuntu CD is 'boot from first HDD'
2009-03-02T21:26:00.000Z	Jean_		Is there anybody to confirm this ?
2009-03-02T21:27:00.000Z	corey	Jean_	it is not booting from cd. I can tell because the disk wont spin up
2009-03-02T21:28:00.000Z	Jean_	corey	It's a good proof ;-)
2009-03-02T21:29:00.000Z	Jean_	corey	Then I'm sorry but it seems that I'm too limited in my knowledges (that are not exceptional!) to solve your problem.
