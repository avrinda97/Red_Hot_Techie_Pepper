2012-01-23T15:16:00.000Z	theadmin	kieppie	Read up on that...
2012-01-23T15:17:00.000Z	kieppie	theadmin	thanks, I will
2012-01-23T15:21:00.000Z	kieppie	theadmin	are you seeing that -geomerty is univeral for all GUI apps; that it's implied?
2012-01-23T15:26:00.000Z	kieppie	theadmin	I've tried adding the geometry arg, but it didn't help. do I need to invoke the app using a command similar to xinit for it to take (X is already init'd)?
2012-01-23T15:32:00.000Z	theadmin	kieppie	Yes. Well, -geometry is a flag implied by Xorg. However, I'm not *exactly* sure all apps follow the standards of implementing it.
2012-01-23T15:33:00.000Z	theadmin	kieppie	Bah.
2012-01-23T15:42:00.000Z	kieppie	theadmin	is there a way to hardcode that geometry arg into xorg.conf, so that all apps loaded use that size?
2012-01-23T15:43:00.000Z	theadmin	kieppie	Is this what you are looking for? http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/oneiric/man1/xdotool.1.html
2012-01-23T15:50:00.000Z	kieppie	theadmin	yea - pretty nasty, but could do the trick
2012-01-23T15:51:00.000Z	theadmin	kieppie	Nasty? Just use "xdotool windowsize %1 640 480" or something
2012-01-23T15:51:00.000Z	theadmin	kieppie	Openbox maybe. I use that myself and am fully satisfied.
2012-01-23T15:52:00.000Z	kieppie	theadmin	oh sorry - reading that now. though I had to simulate keypress to do what I want
2012-01-23T15:53:00.000Z	theadmin	kieppie	Openbox is faster than Fluxbox for all I know. Also, xdotool automates pretty much everything so...
2012-01-23T16:26:00.000Z	theadmin	kieppie	:(
2012-01-23T16:26:00.000Z	theadmin	kieppie	Should've worked. Sad. Oh well.
2012-01-23T16:31:00.000Z	kieppie	theadmin	is openbox the most lightweigh d/m?
2012-01-23T16:31:00.000Z	theadmin	kieppie	It's very lightweight, but there are even more lightweight alternatives... Like i3, awesome, dwm...
