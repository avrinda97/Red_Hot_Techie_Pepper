2008-08-12T10:01:00.000Z	rand0m		how do I install a .tar.gz file that only has source in it ?
2008-08-12T10:01:00.000Z	prince_jammys	rand0m	there's usually a README in there
2008-08-12T10:01:00.000Z	rand0m	prince_jammys	the one in this one doesn't make much sense
2008-08-12T10:02:00.000Z	prince_jammys	rand0m	usally './configure' , then 'make', and then 'sudo make install' (i'd check wherever you got it from for special directions)
2008-08-12T10:02:00.000Z	rand0m		there's no easier way than that?
2008-08-12T10:03:00.000Z	rand0m		i thought by now linux had found a way to make this type of procses eaiser
2008-08-12T10:03:00.000Z	prince_jammys	rand0m	yes, not compiling and installing from repository ;)
2008-08-12T10:03:00.000Z	rand0m		this one is saying stuff like, first, make sure you have this, and this and that, etc, then open terminal and type like 20 lines
2008-08-12T10:04:00.000Z	rand0m		all im trying to do is install a simple guitar tuner
2008-08-12T10:04:00.000Z	rand0m		i wouldn't know what to look for
2008-08-12T10:04:00.000Z	rand0m		im over it
2008-08-12T10:04:00.000Z	prince_jammys		!info gtkguitune | rand0m
2008-08-12T10:04:00.000Z	rand0m		this is way complicated for simply installing a guitar tuner
2008-08-12T10:05:00.000Z	prince_jammys	rand0m	you could try if that suits you. sudo apt-get install gtkguitune  is the only command.
2008-08-12T10:05:00.000Z	rand0m		sweet, that's precisely the simplicity i was looking for
2008-08-12T10:05:00.000Z	rand0m		thank you
2008-08-12T10:07:00.000Z	prince_jammys	rand0m	there's another one called 'lingot'. you can install it the same way as above.
2008-08-12T10:08:00.000Z	rand0m	prince_jammys	awesome, thanks again mate
