2008-03-24T19:08:00.000Z	Raven		Hello, I'm brand new to linux and was wondering how you ran as root?  I just downloaded adept manager and it says I need to run as root, but Ubuntu won't let me log into root at the login screen.
2008-03-24T19:10:00.000Z	Raven		so I have to do that in the console?
2008-03-24T19:10:00.000Z	Raven		or Konsole as it's spelled?
