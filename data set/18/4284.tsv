2009-05-04T17:53:00.000Z	MarshWiggle_		anyone able to help with nvidia issues?
2009-05-04T17:53:00.000Z	sacarlson	MarshWiggle_	can't say that I can help but I can tell you I also have them and Have tried alot
2009-05-04T17:54:00.000Z	MarshWiggle_	sacarlson	it's a messy thing me thinks
2009-05-04T17:55:00.000Z	sacarlson	MarshWiggle_	only thing I got working so far is the nv driver
2009-05-04T18:17:00.000Z	MarshWiggle_	sacarlson	do you mean they just haven't caught up with these bugs yet
2009-05-04T18:18:00.000Z	MarshWiggle_	sacarlson	if you're familiar with where i could find the fix that's be awsome,, if not that;'s cool. i'll keep looking
2009-05-04T18:20:00.000Z	MarshWiggle_	sacarlson	how did that go
2009-05-04T18:21:00.000Z	MarshWiggle_	sacarlson	did that end up working?
2009-05-04T18:31:00.000Z	sacarlson	MarshWiggle_	I'm in gnome with this same problem so I don't think the problem is in kde
2009-05-04T18:32:00.000Z	MarshWiggle_	sacarlson	good to know i'm not alone lol
2009-05-04T18:33:00.000Z	MarshWiggle_	sacarlson	I'm wondering whether this is worthy of a jaunty bug reoprt of sorts then
2009-05-04T18:35:00.000Z	MarshWiggle_	sacarlson	what's your monitor?
2009-05-04T18:35:00.000Z	sacarlson	MarshWiggle_	sycnmaster 932b
2009-05-04T18:36:00.000Z	MarshWiggle_	sacarlson	what's the image look like with the nvidia propietry drivers
2009-05-04T18:38:00.000Z	MarshWiggle_	sacarlson	ah. i remember readin in one forum that you can actually configure a ~/. hidden file that has the nvidia settings on it, can't find that now
2009-05-04T18:39:00.000Z	MarshWiggle_	sacarlson	perhaps, i don't have the info now (goes searching again)
2009-05-04T18:41:00.000Z	MarshWiggle_	sacarlson	i might have a look where the resolutions settings are moved to, since they are no longer displayed in the xorg.conf in jaunty
2009-05-04T18:52:00.000Z	MarshWiggle_	sacarlson	do you know how to check what version of gnome or kde you're running?
