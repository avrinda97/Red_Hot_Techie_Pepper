2008-03-18T04:32:00.000Z	Netham45		what is the default runlevel for a fresh Ubuntu install?
2008-03-18T04:33:00.000Z	Netham45		ok
2008-03-18T04:34:00.000Z	Netham45		how do I make my Ubuntu computer go to a static IP as opposed to getting a new DHCP one every boot?
2008-03-18T04:34:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Netham45	either edit /etc/network/interfaces, or use nm-applet to manually configure your connection
2008-03-18T04:35:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Netham45	so then edit /etc/network/interfaces
2008-03-18T04:35:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Netham45	the settings appropriate for your manually configured connection.  Read the manpage
2008-03-18T04:40:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Netham45	i doubt it
2008-03-18T04:42:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Netham45	vi isn't going to crash your network connection lolol
2008-03-18T04:42:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Netham45	sounds like you've got some hardware issues then
2008-03-18T07:07:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Netham45	the halflife server has to be running to connect to it
2008-03-18T07:07:00.000Z	Netham45	Fryguy--	it is running
2008-03-18T07:07:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Netham45	what IP is it bound to?
2008-03-18T07:07:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Netham45	and did it actually start correctly, or were there errors
2008-03-18T07:09:00.000Z	Netham45	Fryguy--	it is a brand new install of the server, on a brand new install of Ubuntu Desktop
2008-03-18T07:09:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Netham45	sounds like a problem for the halflife server people, not ubuntu
2008-03-18T07:10:00.000Z	Netham45	Fryguy--	so there is no firewall, etc... built into Ubuntu desktop that may be killing it?
2008-03-18T07:10:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Netham45	no
2008-03-21T06:24:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Netham45	sed and awk, or perl, or cut.  shell scripting is outside of the scope of this channel
