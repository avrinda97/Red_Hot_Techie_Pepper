2005-06-21T14:52:00.000Z	madsen		Hmm, how do I force an apt-get install to not care about dependencies?
2005-06-21T14:53:00.000Z	madsen		Ok, back to me... Forcing install in spite of "missing" deps.
2005-06-21T14:54:00.000Z	madsen		How? --^
2005-06-21T14:55:00.000Z	HappyFool	madsen	'man apt-get' reveals '--ignore-missing', though i imagine that is likely to cause tears in the long run
2005-06-21T14:56:00.000Z	madsen	HappyFool	Nah, it's just bitching about libc6 being labeled 2.3.2.ds1-20ubuntu13 and not 2.3.2.ds1-21... I don't think it'll be that bad.
2005-06-21T14:57:00.000Z	madsen	HappyFool	Hmm, --ignore-missing doesn't cut it. apt-get still bitches.
2005-06-21T14:58:00.000Z	HappyFool	madsen	read 'man apt-get' --- it mentions combining that with what kvidell mentioned.
2005-06-21T14:59:00.000Z	madsen	HappyFool	Nope, no luck still...
2005-06-21T14:59:00.000Z	HappyFool	madsen	the stars are not in your favour
2005-06-21T15:00:00.000Z	madsen	HappyFool	:(
2005-06-21T15:00:00.000Z	HappyFool	madsen	i guess you're not ignoring 'missing' packages -- libc isn't missing, it's got the wrong version
2005-06-21T15:01:00.000Z	madsen	HappyFool	--^
2005-06-21T15:01:00.000Z	madsen	HappyFool	It is... It actually ignores...
2005-06-21T15:03:00.000Z	HappyFool	madsen	i've never used the 'equivs' package, but it's description is 'Circumvent Debian package dependencies'
2005-06-21T15:04:00.000Z	madsen	HappyFool	lol!
2005-06-21T15:04:00.000Z	madsen	HappyFool	I installed from a Warty CD and upgraded... (Loooong wait there.)
2005-06-21T15:05:00.000Z	HappyFool	madsen	hey, i'm on 56kb :P took me 40 hours (or more?) to download hoary
