2007-08-26T06:54:00.000Z	yasper		i would like some help installing ubuntu please
2007-08-26T06:54:00.000Z	yasper		I am currently trying to set up a partition table and just need to clarify some details
2007-08-26T06:55:00.000Z	yasper		ok. I am getting rid of all MS and installing ubintu - build 7.04
2007-08-26T06:56:00.000Z	yasper		previously I had several partitions on 2 physical HDDs
2007-08-26T06:56:00.000Z	yasper		I want to partition unbuntu to run in a similar way - although from a few guides I have read it doesn;t seem to work the same way
2007-08-26T06:57:00.000Z	yasper		my 'home' partition will be "/"
2007-08-26T06:57:00.000Z	Ashfire908	yasper	how exactly do you want to partition it?
2007-08-26T06:58:00.000Z	Ashfire908	yasper	/ is root, not home
2007-08-26T06:58:00.000Z	yasper		do I have to specify all the other partitons or can I just install ubuntu then sort the rest of the partitions out after "like on windows"?
2007-08-26T06:59:00.000Z	Ashfire908	yasper	you need to use lvm of that
2007-08-26T07:00:00.000Z	yasper		sorry <ashfire908> did not get that
2007-08-26T07:01:00.000Z	Ashfire908	yasper	lvm allows more freedom when setting up partitions. it allows you to make a partiton span a hard drive and to resize in more ways
2007-08-26T07:02:00.000Z	yasper		ok - do i use lvm after install, yes?
2007-08-26T07:02:00.000Z	Ashfire908	yasper	but if you are wanting to have one partiton for /home  another for / and another as swap, etc, than you don't need lvm
2007-08-26T07:03:00.000Z	yasper		<ash>, by swap you mean if i want dual boot?
2007-08-26T07:03:00.000Z	Ashfire908	yasper	no
2007-08-26T07:04:00.000Z	yasper	Ashfire908	can we chat in private please as I can't follow all this text!
2007-08-26T07:04:00.000Z	Ashfire908	yasper	swap as in swap space
