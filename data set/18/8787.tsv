2007-09-06T11:24:00.000Z	evri2	ianm_	when computer doesn't need GPU power,my GPU speed goes down 450mhz to 100mhz
2007-09-06T11:24:00.000Z	evri2		how can i prevent that?
2007-09-06T11:25:00.000Z	ianm_	evri2	that sounds like something the hardware does itself, or the driver handles, no?
2007-09-06T11:43:00.000Z	evri2		can someone help me?How can i run my GPU at full speed?
2007-09-06T11:44:00.000Z	ianm_	evri2	how do you know it's not running at full speed?
2007-09-06T11:45:00.000Z	evri2	ianm_	download nvclock
2007-09-06T11:45:00.000Z	evri2	ianm_	if you have nvidia card,of course
2007-09-06T11:45:00.000Z	evri2	ianm_	then type command nvidia -s
2007-09-06T11:45:00.000Z	evri2		sorry
2007-09-06T11:45:00.000Z	evri2	ianm_	nvclock -s
2007-09-06T11:47:00.000Z	ianm_	evri2	I don't have an nvidia.  I'm not sure I understand your problem.  nvclock tells you your GPU is running slower than normal?
2007-09-06T11:48:00.000Z	ianm_	evri2	there's an irc channel for nvclock:   #nvclock on irc.freenode.net
2007-09-06T11:48:00.000Z	evri2	ianm_	it tells. + i can feel it thanks to laggy screens :)
