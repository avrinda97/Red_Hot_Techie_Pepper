2008-12-09T04:30:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire	dr_willis	Does it include backported drivers, etc though?
2008-12-09T04:30:00.000Z	dr_willis	GodfatherofEire	 cant say that ive ever noticed many 'drivers' for scanners under linux. :)  all the scanners ive tried have worked from the start - worked better then they do in windows
2008-12-09T04:31:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire	dr_willis	thanks for the that
2008-12-14T16:30:00.000Z	dr_willis	GodfatherofEire	 the adblockplus extension works here
2008-12-14T16:30:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire	dr_willis	really? so far I havent been able to remove it
2008-12-14T16:32:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire	dr_willis	so exactly what filter do you have for ABP that blocks the intelliTXT, cause its bein a pain on my end
2008-12-14T16:33:00.000Z	dr_willis	GodfatherofEire	 i just let it auto-update/subscribe at the start after i install it.. and i never notice them after that
2008-12-14T16:35:00.000Z	dr_willis	GodfatherofEire	 almost instantly as far as i recall
2008-12-14T16:35:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire	dr_willis	alright, well, I'll try again in a bit
2008-12-14T16:37:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire	dr_willis	server must be down or somethin, cause Mine still has nothing from the local list, but its already got one from bloody Germany
2008-12-22T09:44:00.000Z	dr_willis	GodfatherofEire	 i was thinking one could just do a ffmpeg foo.flv foo.avi      and it would convert..
2008-12-22T09:45:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire	dr_willis	any way I could program a script/widget for a gui interface?
2008-12-22T09:46:00.000Z	dr_willis	GodfatherofEire	 proberly could..    or make a little script that pops up a dialog asks for file... then convertes..  but seems a little overkill for a simple command like that.
2008-12-22T09:47:00.000Z	dr_willis	GodfatherofEire	 or google for ffmpeg front ends..
2008-12-22T09:47:00.000Z	dr_willis	GodfatherofEire	 avidemux  can proberly do it.. but its proberly overkill
2008-12-22T09:47:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire	dr_willis	yeah, I was just wondering because the file names are frequently a pain
2008-12-22T09:48:00.000Z	GodfatherofEire	dr_willis	yeah, it can, but I just dont feel like installing/using the jack audio server, cause its a pain on this thing
