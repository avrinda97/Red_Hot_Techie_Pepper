2006-09-27T09:32:00.000Z	kuja		Mind the sort of off-topic question... but installing the Java runtime is a horrendous pain for me on Ubuntu, and I was wondering what are some good up-to-date alternatives that pose to be greater than JRE 1.5?
2006-09-27T09:32:00.000Z	kuja		gcj seems to show itself as 1.4.x
2006-09-27T09:32:00.000Z	frogzoo	kuja	jre installs out of the repos totally hands free
2006-09-27T09:34:00.000Z	frogzoo	kuja	sudo apt-get install sun-java5-jre
2006-09-27T09:35:00.000Z	kuja	frogzoo	That precise thing (and a manual install) fails with a "cannot find libjava.so"
2006-09-27T09:35:00.000Z	frogzoo	kuja	dapper ?
2006-12-09T09:24:00.000Z	frogzoo	kuja	/boot/grub/menu.lst
2006-12-09T09:24:00.000Z	kuja	frogzoo	Yes, I know what it is, grr
2006-12-09T09:24:00.000Z	kuja	frogzoo	Read carefully: I want to change the default hdd that update-grub generates to make it generate hdb from now on.
2006-12-09T09:24:00.000Z	frogzoo	kuja	that's where update-grub gets the device name
2006-12-09T09:25:00.000Z	frogzoo	kuja	yes it is
2006-12-09T09:25:00.000Z	kuja	frogzoo	So where is it?
2006-12-09T09:26:00.000Z	frogzoo	kuja	look for a line with 'kopt='
2006-12-09T09:26:00.000Z	kuja	frogzoo	Do I edit the comment-looking directive of it? Or do I add one without a hash?
2006-12-09T09:27:00.000Z	frogzoo	kuja	leave the comment in - that's needed for how it works - just set the root=  to whatever
2006-12-09T09:27:00.000Z	kuja	frogzoo	Thank you. I will try that.
2006-12-09T09:28:00.000Z	kuja	frogzoo	Yes, that's what it was. It was the "commented" kopt.
2006-12-09T09:29:00.000Z	kuja	frogzoo	Thank you.
