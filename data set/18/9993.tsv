2008-01-24T22:24:00.000Z	chazco	un0p	- It may not... im having issues with my MS keyboard, others work fine
2008-01-24T22:25:00.000Z	un0p	chazco	the non-standard keys might need a little extra hacking about on to get working -- but they'll work
2008-01-24T22:25:00.000Z	un0p	chazco	hmm -- was linux installed with it plugged in?
2008-01-24T22:26:00.000Z	chazco	un0p	- Yes
2008-01-24T22:26:00.000Z	un0p	chazco	hmm, so it did work initially and then died on you?
2008-01-24T22:27:00.000Z	un0p	chazco	thats unusual, have you tried reconfiguring xorg around it?
2008-01-24T22:28:00.000Z	chazco	un0p	- Ive tried all sorts for now... what puzzles me is sometimes it works fine, even the media keys on it
2008-01-24T22:36:00.000Z	un0p	chazco	does your syslog/messages file report anything regarding the keyb?
2008-01-24T22:36:00.000Z	chazco	un0p	- dmesg shows it fine
2008-01-27T15:31:00.000Z	un0p	chazco	your apt archive might not fit onto a live CD eh
2008-01-27T15:39:00.000Z	un0p	chazco	get a "real" isp :)
2008-01-27T15:39:00.000Z	chazco	un0p	- Almost all UK ISP's are like that
2008-01-27T15:40:00.000Z	un0p	chazco	mine ain't tho -- and if i ever were to subscribe to another's services, i'd ensure i had unlimited access -- 10GB isnt enough a day, let alone a month
2008-01-27T15:40:00.000Z	chazco	un0p	- Country and ISP?
2008-01-27T15:41:00.000Z	un0p	chazco	uk, virgin media (used to be blueyonder/telewest)
2008-01-27T15:42:00.000Z	un0p	chazco	errm, it's available in most towns and cities -- but even with DSL, plenty of ISPs willing to give you unlimited access
2008-01-27T15:42:00.000Z	chazco	un0p	- It isnt, you'd really be surprised :) And very few DSL subscribers offer anything near unlimited (check out their FUPs as well)... anyway, bit off topic :)
2008-01-27T15:43:00.000Z	un0p	chazco	if you're willing to look for the ones that have uncapped services, you'll find them easy enough - but yea, this is getting !ot
