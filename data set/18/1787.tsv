2010-11-09T14:57:00.000Z	Genevieve		using ubuntu 10.10 netbook edition. I don't have a wired internet connection, only wifi. my wireless card is a broadcom 4313 which is supported by the broadcom sta driver included in ubuntu 10.10. when booted through liveCD, it appears on the "additional drivers" list but cannot activate. on the fully installed version, the driver doesn't appear at all
