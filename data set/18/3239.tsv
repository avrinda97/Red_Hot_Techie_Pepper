2009-11-09T05:41:00.000Z	lordganesh		how to create live usb for ubuntu 9.10
2009-11-09T05:42:00.000Z	NotBert	lordganesh	I've had good luck using a program called unetbootin
2009-11-09T05:43:00.000Z	lordganesh	NotBert	what is package for unetbootin
2009-11-09T05:43:00.000Z	NotBert	lordganesh	here is the link: http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/
2009-11-09T05:44:00.000Z	NotBert	lordganesh	What OS will you be using to create the live USB?
2009-11-09T05:44:00.000Z	lordganesh	NotBert	ubuntu 9.10
2009-11-09T05:45:00.000Z	NotBert	lordganesh	OK, the ubuntu package for unetbootin is broken iirc, so you'll have to download the generic linux version from that webpage.
2009-11-09T05:46:00.000Z	lordganesh	NotBert	i see its bin file ..how to install it
2009-11-09T05:47:00.000Z	NotBert	lordganesh	do you know how to open a terminal window?
2009-11-09T05:48:00.000Z	lordganesh	NotBert	yes
2009-11-09T05:50:00.000Z	NotBert		OK, open a terminal window and install the following packages mtools and p7zip-full
2009-11-09T05:52:00.000Z	NotBert	lordganesh	Once you've done that you'll need to let ubuntu know that the unetbootin file is executable. Let me know when you're ready to do that.
2009-11-09T05:53:00.000Z	lordganesh	NotBert	i am running unebootin now
2009-11-09T05:54:00.000Z	NotBert	lordganesh	I'll be around for a few, so if you have any questions just ask!
2009-11-09T06:02:00.000Z	lordganesh	NotBert	i tried it but it doesn't work
2009-11-09T06:03:00.000Z	NotBert	lordganesh	Did you verify the md5sum of your iso?
2009-11-09T06:04:00.000Z	lordganesh	NotBert	what is md5sum
