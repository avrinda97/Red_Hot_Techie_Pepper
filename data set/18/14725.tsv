2005-06-21T09:20:00.000Z	Severim		I got a nic that is only getting a ip6 address but no ip4 address from the dhcp, any idea why?
2005-06-21T09:20:00.000Z	bob2	Severim	it got the ipv6 address before dhcp ran
2005-06-21T09:21:00.000Z	bob2	Severim	is the dhcp server working ofr other machines?  did this work at all?
2005-06-21T09:21:00.000Z	Severim	bob2	well it won't get an address from the router
2005-06-21T09:21:00.000Z	Severim	bob2	all hardware and connections are good
2005-06-21T09:21:00.000Z	bob2	Severim	is this over wireless?
2005-06-21T09:21:00.000Z	Severim	bob2	nope
2005-06-21T09:21:00.000Z	bob2	Severim	can you assign the ip and such statically and have it work?
2005-06-21T09:22:00.000Z	Severim	bob2	does not work
2005-06-21T09:22:00.000Z	bob2	Severim	sure you'e doing it right?
2005-06-21T09:22:00.000Z	Severim	bob2	loopback has both but the nic does not, could it be a nic driver compatibility issue?
2005-06-21T09:23:00.000Z	bob2	Severim	I'd be surprised.  what sort of nic is it?
2005-06-21T09:23:00.000Z	Severim	bob2	positive unless if there was more to the ubuntu install than any other linux os?
2005-06-21T09:23:00.000Z	Severim	bob2	cnet some generic ne2k compatible nic I believe
2005-06-21T09:25:00.000Z	bob2	Severim	is the interface up?
2005-06-21T09:26:00.000Z	bob2	Severim	is the interface up?
2005-06-21T09:27:00.000Z	Severim	bob2	according to the network settings it is active
2005-06-21T09:28:00.000Z	Severim	bob2	if set to static it takes the ip address but does not go anywhere, no ping out
