2006-04-24T15:09:00.000Z	DBO		you need it
2006-04-24T15:11:00.000Z	DBO		bit of a catch22
2006-04-24T15:11:00.000Z	DBO		so erm... color me stupid... but how are you online right now?
2006-04-24T15:11:00.000Z	DBO		ooooh
2006-04-24T15:11:00.000Z	DBO		you dont need wireless with the liveboot
2006-04-24T15:12:00.000Z	DBO		NO
2006-04-24T15:12:00.000Z	DBO		Never use automatix
2006-04-24T15:12:00.000Z	DBO		it breaks systems
2006-04-24T15:13:00.000Z	DBO		and harsh
2006-04-24T15:13:00.000Z	DBO		!automatix
2006-04-24T15:15:00.000Z	cge	DBO	if a password is never showing up, is that the problem? I seem to recall that a password entry does show up even if you don't have permission.
2006-04-24T15:16:00.000Z	DBO	cge	I know... which is why I had the "and failing that" aspect to give him root permissions
2006-04-24T15:16:00.000Z	cge	DBO	ah, I see.
2006-04-24T15:17:00.000Z	DBO	cge	hacking a system with local access is just too easy =P  /etc/passwd really should be encrypted in some form...
2006-04-24T15:17:00.000Z	cge	DBO	won't help. The whole partition would have to be encrypted
2006-04-24T15:18:00.000Z	DBO	cge	meh, Im not concerned with people comprimising the box locally, that is going to happen.  I am concerned with people compromising the box locally in a way that is hard to detect and doesnt effect the system performance
2006-04-24T15:20:00.000Z	cge	DBO	oh, I see. If it were encrypted, I suppose that the attacker wouldn't be able to keep the same passwords for everyone. But even then, the encryption would have to be such that the user had to enter some passphrase while booting, or an attacker could gain root and then decrypt it.
2006-04-24T15:21:00.000Z	DBO	cge	you are correct, such a scheme would be... very complex
