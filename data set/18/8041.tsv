2007-10-11T07:25:00.000Z	Neodudeman		Hi, I have a partition problem, can someone help me out?
2007-10-11T07:25:00.000Z	Neodudeman		I came by ealier, and I got gparted running; but I can't seem to make a boot disk out of gparted.
2007-10-11T07:26:00.000Z	Neodudeman		I burned the LiveCD from the gparted website, and it just won't live up.
2007-10-11T07:27:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Neodudeman	 you sure you burnt it properly? check the disk in windows. see whats on it.
2007-10-11T07:28:00.000Z	Neodudeman	Dr_willis	kk. I'll check under windows. What should it have in it?
2007-10-11T07:29:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Neodudeman	 if you have a single large .iso file.. you did it wrong. :) if it has a lot of other files.. guess it was done right. How did you burn the .iso file?
2007-10-11T07:30:00.000Z	Neodudeman	Dr_willis	I extracted it from the ISO in Linux, and copied it into the blank CD 'folder.' I then hit Write.
2007-10-11T07:30:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Neodudeman	 extracted? I belive you did it wrong then. Use a iso burning tool.   you do NOT extract the files,m then drag/drop them to the cd under windows.
2007-10-11T07:31:00.000Z	Neodudeman	Dr_willis	I burnt it like that in ubuntu though. I'll try reburning it in windows.
2007-10-11T07:32:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Neodudeman	 under ubuntu - you should be able to just double click it and hit burn
2007-10-11T07:45:00.000Z	Neodudeman	Dr_willis	still no luck doc. I burnt the disk using Roxio in Windows, and gparted Still won't boot off of it.
2007-10-11T07:46:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Neodudeman	 use 'burnatonce' or somthing real simple.
2007-10-11T07:46:00.000Z	Neodudeman	Dr_willis	alright.
2007-10-11T07:46:00.000Z	Neodudeman	Dr_willis	while i'm here though, do you know how to change screen rbightness in ubuntu?
2007-10-11T07:47:00.000Z	Neodudeman	Dr_willis	brightness*
2007-10-11T07:47:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Neodudeman	 may want to redownload the iso for the gparted live cd also.
2007-10-11T07:47:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Neodudeman	 i just hit the brightness buttons on my laptop
2007-10-11T07:48:00.000Z	Neodudeman	Dr_willis	doh. =P. I need some of those. lol. Alright. I'm gonna re-dl GPARTED and then I'mma download burnatonce
