2006-09-10T06:20:00.000Z	flabdablet	holycow	when you have trouble like this, have you considered using Coral?  That is, does http://fpdownload.macromedia.com.nyud.net:8080/get/flashplayer/current/install_flash_player_7_linux.tar.gz work for you?
2006-09-10T06:21:00.000Z	holycow	flabdablet	thats an interesting experiment ... trying
2006-09-10T06:24:00.000Z	holycow	flabdablet	nada ...
2006-09-10T06:27:00.000Z	flabdablet	holycow	hmmmm.  didn't work for me either.  This did, though: http://www.the-cloak.com/Cloaked/+cfg=15/http://fpdownload.macromedia.com/get/flashplayer/current/install_flash_player_7_linux.tar.gz
2006-09-10T06:28:00.000Z	holycow	flabdablet	no shit
2006-09-10T06:29:00.000Z	holycow	flabdablet	wow thats cool, i didn't know about that site
2006-09-10T06:30:00.000Z	holycow	flabdablet	*ooo* i didn't think that was supported yet ... ?
2006-09-10T06:30:00.000Z	flabdablet	holycow	maybe that's why it won't work for me then :-(
