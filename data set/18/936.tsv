2012-07-04T02:55:00.000Z	shazzr		Is it possible to use a Hauppauge Win-TV NOVA-T USB stick on Ubuntu 12.04 at all? I can't get mine to work...
2012-07-04T02:56:00.000Z	gr33n7007h	shazzr	yes it's possible
2012-07-04T02:58:00.000Z	gr33n7007h	shazzr	I watch mine through Mplayer
2012-07-04T02:59:00.000Z	shazzr	gr33n7007h	How?
2012-07-04T03:00:00.000Z	gr33n7007h	shazzr	create a channel.conf using w_scan here's the command: w_scan -ft -c GB -X -R N -O N >> channels.conf
2012-07-04T03:02:00.000Z	gr33n7007h	shazzr	change the -c flag to your country code ie if in the states US
2012-07-04T03:03:00.000Z	shazzr	gr33n7007h	I'm in Norway. So I guess it should read NO?
2012-07-04T03:03:00.000Z	gr33n7007h	shazzr	yes
2012-07-04T03:04:00.000Z	shazzr	gr33n7007h	Not sure what to do afterwards though....
2012-07-04T03:05:00.000Z	gr33n7007h	shazzr	it'll take a while to create channels.conf but when it's finished copy the channels.conf into the mplayer dir: cp channels.conf ~/.mplayer/channels.con
2012-07-04T03:06:00.000Z	gr33n7007h	shazzr	it'll take a while to create channels.conf but when it's finished copy the channels.conf into the mplayer dir: cp channels.conf ~/.mplayer/ then : mplayer dvb://
2012-07-04T03:07:00.000Z	shazzr	gr33n7007h	I might be out of luck. I don't think we have a signal for the kind of reciever where I am right now.... :(

2012-07-04T03:08:00.000Z	gr33n7007h	shazzr	you could try kaffeine
2012-07-04T03:09:00.000Z	shazzr	gr33n7007h	Think I've done that already. No luck with that one either. I will bring the stick with me to a place where I KNOW there is coverage and try what you mentioned there....
2012-07-04T03:10:00.000Z	gr33n7007h	shazzr	sure
2012-07-04T03:11:00.000Z	shazzr	gr33n7007h	Thank you anyway. :)
2012-07-04T03:11:00.000Z	gr33n7007h	shazzr	np
