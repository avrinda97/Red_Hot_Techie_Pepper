2005-06-24T09:31:00.000Z	ialexei		Hi, is every1 here using Linux ?
2005-06-24T09:31:00.000Z	ialexei		cool =) Smart
2005-06-24T09:32:00.000Z	ialexei		This is cool, Ubuntu is the coolest distro ever
2005-06-24T09:34:00.000Z	ialexei		The only quirk I had with Ubuntu was I was looking for a services manager to be present deafult, ended up downloading bum and it was cool
2005-06-24T09:36:00.000Z	ialexei		OK folks I have a question. I am a first time Ubuntu user. I noticed that Ubuntu is running the PostFix deamon as a service (starts at bootup). Why ?
2005-06-24T09:36:00.000Z	ialexei		Why do I need this ?
2005-06-24T09:37:00.000Z	ialexei		Reposting -- OK folks I have a question. I am a first time Ubuntu user. I noticed that Ubuntu is running the PostFix deamon as a service (starts at bootup). Why ?
2005-06-24T09:38:00.000Z	cthulfuego	ialexei	So that mail can be processed.
2005-06-24T09:40:00.000Z	cthulfuego	ialexei	No, but your local system sends mails to the root or other use about cron jobs that fail etc.
2005-06-24T09:43:00.000Z	cthulfuego	ialexei	Why?
2005-06-24T09:43:00.000Z	cthulfuego	ialexei	No, but you would get errors logs about mail being disabled.
2005-06-24T09:44:00.000Z	cthulfuego	ialexei	It *is* configured properly.
2005-06-24T09:44:00.000Z	cthulfuego	ialexei	Unless you changed the config...
2005-06-24T09:48:00.000Z	cthulfuego	ialexei	/usr/share/doc/netkit-inetd
2005-06-24T09:48:00.000Z	cthulfuego	ialexei	All pckages have docs. read them.
2005-06-24T09:49:00.000Z	cthulfuego	ialexei	<heh>
2005-06-24T09:50:00.000Z	cthulfuego	ialexei	Just keep in mind most stuff is installed for a good reason, even if the reason may not be immediately obvious. Apart from all that python shit, Ubuntu has fairly sane defaults.
2005-06-24T09:54:00.000Z	cthulfuego	ialexei	'sudo apt-get install bum'
