2008-05-21T18:51:00.000Z	delire_		has anyone here had success with a native install of Ubuntu on a Mac Pro (ie the desktop edition).
2008-05-21T18:51:00.000Z	delire_		in other words, Ubuntu on a Mac Pro without virtualisation.
2008-05-21T18:51:00.000Z	bstock	delire_	i've done it with the alternate install cd
2008-05-21T18:51:00.000Z	delire_	bstock	great. which version of Ubuntu?
2008-05-21T18:52:00.000Z	bstock	delire_	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MacBook
2008-05-21T18:52:00.000Z	bstock		that site is for just that
2008-05-21T18:52:00.000Z	delire_	bstock	cheers..
2008-05-21T18:52:00.000Z	bstock		;)
2008-05-21T18:52:00.000Z	delire_	bstock	out of interest do you have full hardware 3D acceleration?
2008-05-21T18:52:00.000Z	bstock		yeah i have macbook pro with nvidia chip in it
2008-05-21T18:52:00.000Z	bstock		is yours macbook pro or regular?
2008-05-21T18:54:00.000Z	delire_	bstock	it's not my machine. the museum in which i'm installing my interactive artwork has only Mac Pros (ie the desktops).
2008-05-21T18:54:00.000Z	delire_	bstock	i develop my 3D artworks with Linux, hence the issue..
2008-05-21T18:54:00.000Z	bstock		ah yeah. well i have full 3d accel with my macbook pro with nvidia 8600 in it
2008-05-21T18:54:00.000Z	bstock		those have nvidia cards?
2008-05-21T18:55:00.000Z	delire_	bstock	apparently..
2008-05-21T18:55:00.000Z	bstock		hopefully, nvidia has best support for ubuntu. but yeah i have full 3d accel
2008-05-21T18:56:00.000Z	delire_	bstock	good news. well i won't be doing the install, rather someone at the museum. cheers for the link, it's a goodie.
