2009-07-08T01:53:00.000Z	MikeChelen		why would camorama show an error for /dev/video0 when mplayer works fine?
2009-07-08T01:53:00.000Z	MikeChelen		cheese isn't working either
2009-07-08T01:55:00.000Z	DPic	MikeChelen	hit alt+f2 and type gstreamer-properties
2009-07-08T01:55:00.000Z	DPic	MikeChelen	then go to video and test the default input
2009-07-08T01:57:00.000Z	MikeChelen	DPic	v4l shows "could not read from resource" and v4l2 "could not negotiate format"
2009-07-08T01:59:00.000Z	DPic	MikeChelen	sorry, i'm not sure what you can do...try googling "ubuntu [webcam model]"
2009-07-08T02:00:00.000Z	MikeChelen	DPic	the strange thing is "mplayer /dev/video0" works fine
2009-07-08T02:01:00.000Z	DPic	MikeChelen	mplayer doesn't use the gstreamer framework. what's strange is that mplayer works and gstreamer doesn't.
2009-07-08T02:04:00.000Z	MikeChelen	DPic	ok ill search more, it is capture card WinTV PCR-150
2009-07-08T02:06:00.000Z	DPic	MikeChelen	when you got the gstreamer error, was anything else (mplayer) open using the device?
2009-07-08T02:07:00.000Z	MikeChelen	DPic	nope, it was all closed down
2009-07-08T02:08:00.000Z	DPic	MikeChelen	sorry, i'm just guessing at this point.
2009-07-08T02:09:00.000Z	MikeChelen	DPic	thats okay, thanks for the tips, gives me something more to go on :)
2009-07-08T02:12:00.000Z	MikeChelen	DPic	now it is working in VLC using PVR mode
2009-07-08T02:14:00.000Z	DPic	MikeChelen	try gstreamer-properties again and see if there are other options for your default video input
2009-07-08T02:17:00.000Z	MikeChelen	DPic	only options are test, v4l, v4l2, and custom. tried using "pvr://" for custom, but there is an error "no source element for uri"
2009-07-08T02:18:00.000Z	DPic	MikeChelen	ah, then the problem must be with v4l2, which i have no idea how to deal with, sorry
2009-07-08T02:19:00.000Z	MikeChelen	DPic	ah okay, will look to see what other v4l2 options exist
