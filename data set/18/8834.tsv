2007-12-05T06:35:00.000Z	rabidweezle		it works for windows because windows didn't try to overwrite it
2007-12-05T06:35:00.000Z	rabidweezle		but GRUB overwrites it
2007-12-05T06:35:00.000Z	rabidweezle		hence it doesn't see the larger hard drive
2007-12-05T06:36:00.000Z	rabidweezle		I mean it see's it, but it gimps it down from 160 gigs to 30 gigs
2007-12-05T06:37:00.000Z	rabidweezle		if anyone knows how to make it see the rest of the hard drive so I can use the full potential of the 160 gigs WITHOUT a bios upgrade or ide controller card, let me know
2007-12-05T06:38:00.000Z	rabidweezle		or if anyone knows how to hack out their own bios upgrade so it can see the higher capacity hard drives, that could be usefull too
2007-12-05T06:39:00.000Z	rabidweezle		it's pretty ancient
2007-12-05T06:39:00.000Z	rabidweezle		funny part is...
2007-12-05T06:39:00.000Z	rabidweezle		it has 8x agp and such
2007-12-05T06:39:00.000Z	rabidweezle		it's just...
2007-12-05T06:39:00.000Z	adamonline45	rabidweezle	How big is your /boot?
2007-12-05T06:40:00.000Z	rabidweezle		just the right size as the readme's all said
2007-12-05T06:40:00.000Z	rabidweezle		lemme double check the size though adamonline45
2007-12-05T06:41:00.000Z	rabidweezle	adamonline45	btw, this is the machine in question
2007-12-05T06:42:00.000Z	rabidweezle		ok, /boot is 94 megs
2007-12-05T06:44:00.000Z	rabidweezle		you know, I just though about something adamonline45, I better check to make sure that the jumper for the 30 gig is not on
2007-12-05T06:44:00.000Z	rabidweezle		brb
2007-12-05T06:44:00.000Z	adamonline45	rabidweezle	Alright... Trying to find a doc that helped me years ago...
