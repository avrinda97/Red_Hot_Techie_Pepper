2007-12-30T05:11:00.000Z	moebob		Hello
2007-12-30T05:11:00.000Z	moebob		I need some help with partitioning (This is liquidengineer...my router just died on me.)
2007-12-30T05:12:00.000Z	moebob		I'm looking at the partition table in the installer and there's some irregularities
2007-12-30T05:12:00.000Z	moebob		hda1 is obviously my windows install
2007-12-30T05:12:00.000Z	xobius	moebob	you will edit the file /boot/grub/menu.lst
2007-12-30T05:12:00.000Z	moebob	xobius	I'm back in the livecd installer
2007-12-30T05:12:00.000Z	moebob		I just decided to redo it
2007-12-30T05:13:00.000Z	moebob		I got to step 4 (editing the partition table) and want to make sure I do it right
2007-12-30T05:14:00.000Z	moebob		I'm editing the partition I want to use and just set it for ext3...that's correct, yes?
2007-12-30T05:14:00.000Z	xobius	moebob	can you mount the ubuntu server partition?
2007-12-30T05:14:00.000Z	moebob	xobius	what's that?
2007-12-30T05:15:00.000Z	xobius	moebob	did you install ubuntu server?
2007-12-30T05:15:00.000Z	moebob		I'm installing regular ubuntu (not the server) from the livecd.  I'm still booted into the livecd right now, in the install program
2007-12-30T05:16:00.000Z	xobius	moebob	 it detect the win install?
2007-12-30T05:17:00.000Z	moebob	xobius	it shows as a drive on the livecd, which gives me hope I didn't accidentially destroy it the first time around, but it won't let me mount the disk
2007-12-30T05:17:00.000Z	moebob		something about the ntfs not being released or seomthing
2007-12-30T05:18:00.000Z	moebob		it shows that 29 gigs of the 31 gigs are in use though, so I'm guessing the windows xp install is still there
2007-12-30T05:19:00.000Z	xobius	moebob	what hd have you got?
