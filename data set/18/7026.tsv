2008-02-16T18:09:00.000Z	byspeed		you know how to recover data, when i formatted ntfs, and then installed ubuntu with ext2 or ext3?
2008-02-16T18:10:00.000Z	byspeed		you know how to recover data, when i used windows under ntfs, and then installed ubuntu with ext2 or ext3?
2008-02-16T18:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	byspeed	 you formated a ntfs filesystem  tobe ext2/3 ?
2008-02-16T18:12:00.000Z	byspeed	Dr_Willis	you know how to?
2008-02-16T18:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	byspeed	 you really are not making much sence as to what you are trying to recover..    You wish to recover files on a NTFS filesystem  by using Linux and Linux tools?
2008-02-16T18:15:00.000Z	byspeed	Dr_Willis	no, i used win, under ntfs fyle system, and installed now ubuntu with ext2/3, and forgot to save my htdocs directory with all my project datas
2008-02-16T18:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	byspeed	 so you formated a ntfs   to be ext2 and now you want to recover it?
2008-02-16T18:17:00.000Z	byspeed	Dr_Willis	kinda: i want to recover files, that i forgot to copy on a stick! I formatted the ntfs to be ext2/3 and now using linux on it... if there is any chance to get some files back, then isd be happy
2008-02-16T18:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	byspeed	 i would find  the odds of getting those files bac to be very very low.
2008-02-16T18:18:00.000Z	byspeed	Dr_Willis	no problem, but i want to try it, because otherwise the work of months is killed
2008-02-16T18:19:00.000Z	byspeed	Dr_Willis	well, what programs you know for such things?
2008-02-16T18:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	byspeed	 im not even sure How you would go about scanning a ext3 for ntfs files.
2008-02-16T18:21:00.000Z	byspeed	Dr_Willis	how to do that? :P iam a relative newbie in linux :/
2008-02-16T18:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	byspeed	 i dont know enough on how to do it to even begin to tell you.  You have a large spare hard drive to copy the original hd to>?
2008-02-16T18:22:00.000Z	byspeed	Dr_Willis	well, i only have the harddrive i use with linux now.. on this drive there were the datas stored
2008-02-16T18:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	byspeed	 and the more you use that disk. the more your original data is getting written to over and over and over.
2008-02-16T18:23:00.000Z	byspeed	Dr_Willis	for that reason i just shut the HDD off now... ill try easy recovery... C ya later
2008-02-16T18:24:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	byspeed	 if you want to mazamize your  chances to recover the data. You better get a spare hd. to be using, while you attempt to recover that other one.
