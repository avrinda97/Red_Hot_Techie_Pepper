2007-06-07T07:39:00.000Z	jrib	skulrid	can you see https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/firefox/+bug/14911 and try the *two* workarounds listed there
2007-07-20T06:02:00.000Z	jrib	skulrid	I would boot up a live cd, mount your partition and backup your files if you haven't already before doing anything else
2007-07-20T06:03:00.000Z	skulrid	jrib	can u explain that better please?
2007-07-20T06:04:00.000Z	jrib	skulrid	ok, if you put the desktop cd in your drive and boot your system, you should end up with a working operating system running from the CD.  Then mount the partition your files are on and copy them to removable media or some other safe place
2007-07-20T06:05:00.000Z	jrib	skulrid	what option?
2007-07-20T06:06:00.000Z	jrib	skulrid	what version of ubuntu?
2007-07-20T06:08:00.000Z	jrib	skulrid	well anything after 6.06 dapper will have a desktop cd that is both the install and live system.  Burn one of those and try it.  If that doesn't work, try something like knoppix
2007-07-20T06:09:00.000Z	jrib	skulrid	what happens when you try to load up ubuntu anyway?
2007-07-20T06:11:00.000Z	jrib	skulrid	what if you choose "recovery mode" at the grub menu?
2007-07-20T06:12:00.000Z	skulrid	jrib	basicly the same thing... it wont start
2007-07-20T06:15:00.000Z	skulrid	jrib	shalll i download 6.06 or 7.04?
2007-07-20T06:15:00.000Z	jrib	skulrid	I would go with 7.04
2007-07-20T06:16:00.000Z	jrib	skulrid	recovery mode should give you more verbose information though
