2009-04-24T10:11:00.000Z	Mekhami1		wow I'm confused
2009-04-24T10:11:00.000Z	Mekhami1		Basic Linux info here I suppose but what can I install using sudo apt-get install? Is there a limit?
2009-04-24T10:13:00.000Z	Mekhami1		Anyone answer my question about sudo apt-get
2009-04-24T10:13:00.000Z	Surlent777	Mekhami1	Anything you can get with Synaptic you can get with apt-get, and you can put in a whole crapload of packages to get, and it'll do just fine
2009-04-24T10:14:00.000Z	Surlent777	Mekhami1	how so?
2009-04-24T10:14:00.000Z	Surlent777	Mekhami1	You may have forgotten to press the reload button in Synaptic
2009-04-24T10:14:00.000Z	Mekhami1	Surlent777	I'll see if that was it.
2009-04-24T10:15:00.000Z	Surlent777	Mekhami1	I see it in my 8.10 listings right here
2009-04-24T10:16:00.000Z	Surlent777	Mekhami1	If it's listed in Synaptic, try pressing Reload in Synaptic, and then go to your command line and type "sudo apt-get update"
2009-04-24T10:17:00.000Z	Surlent777	Mekhami1	If it's not listed in synaptic, apt-get won't help; Syanptic is just a nicer looking version of apt, really
2009-04-24T10:20:00.000Z	Surlent777	Mekhami1	Go to the command prompt, and type that in whatever folder it was telling you to...probably the one that has the readme file
2009-04-24T10:24:00.000Z	Mekhami1	Surlent777	How do I find the directory Kismet is installed to? I'm unfamiliar with the linux file system
2009-04-24T10:24:00.000Z	Surlent777	Mekhami1	try typing "whereis kismet"
2009-04-24T10:25:00.000Z	Surlent777	Mekhami1	I don't really know what the program is for or what you're trying to do
2009-04-24T10:26:00.000Z	Surlent777	Mekhami1	OK, you likely just need to go wherever the program was installed to and run it from there
2009-04-24T10:26:00.000Z	Surlent777	Mekhami1	OK lstarnes might be right too...I'm just not thinking straight
2009-04-24T10:29:00.000Z	Surlent777	Mekhami1	It's almost certainly in your /home directory outright, or in a hidden folder in your /home directory, ie /home/mekhamil/.kismet/default.conf, as an example
2009-04-24T10:34:00.000Z	Surlent777	Mekhami1	Sorry, I'm not sure what to do from here, since I don't know the program myself
