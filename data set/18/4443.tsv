2009-04-10T13:24:00.000Z	aldin	mopoyo	you must say what you want to learn
2009-04-10T13:25:00.000Z	mopoyo	aldin	terminal commands and stuff
2009-04-10T13:27:00.000Z	aldin	mopoyo	terminal commands are not ubuntu specific, you can use them on any linux distribution, so the right question you want to learn BASH, go to google and type bash commands
2009-04-10T13:27:00.000Z	mopoyo		what does bash mean?
2009-04-10T13:28:00.000Z	aldin	mopoyo	wikipedia.org and type bash

2009-04-10T13:30:00.000Z	mopoyo		ok sorry aldin
2009-04-10T13:32:00.000Z	aldin	mopoyo	np, key for success is to know how to find answers, and not go round the globe for it, best sources for FAQs are google and wikipedia, you can ask them all, and if you have something specific you can ask here, why should we google it for you, right?
2009-04-10T13:32:00.000Z	aldin	mopoyo	no hard feelings sorry if i was a bit "tough"
2009-04-10T13:36:00.000Z	mopoyo	aldin	you are very smart
2009-04-10T13:37:00.000Z	aldin	mopoyo	thanks, btw. you are very wise
