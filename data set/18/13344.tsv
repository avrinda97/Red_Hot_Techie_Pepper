2006-03-17T09:51:00.000Z	triablo_		how to fix this: checking for GLIB - version >= 2.0.0...
2006-03-17T09:51:00.000Z	triablo_		*** 'pkg-config --modversion glib-2.0' returned 2.10.1, but GLIB (2.8.3)
2006-03-17T09:51:00.000Z	triablo_		*** was found! If pkg-config was correct, then it is best
2006-03-17T09:51:00.000Z	triablo_		*** to remove the old version of GLib. You may also be able to fix the error
2006-03-17T09:51:00.000Z	triablo_		*** by modifying your LD_LIBRARY_PATH enviroment variable, or by editing
2006-03-17T09:51:00.000Z	triablo_		*** /etc/ld.so.conf. Make sure you have run ldconfig if that is
2006-03-17T09:51:00.000Z	triablo_		*** required on your system.
2006-03-17T09:51:00.000Z	triablo_		*** If pkg-config was wrong, set the environment variable PKG_CONFIG_PATH
2006-03-17T09:51:00.000Z	triablo_		*** to point to the correct configuration files

2006-03-17T09:53:00.000Z	nickrud	triablo_	you need to install libglib2.0-dev, but why are you compiling anyway?
2006-03-17T09:54:00.000Z	triablo_	nickrud	I downloaded beta2 gaim, and it is available only in source tar ball
2006-03-17T09:55:00.000Z	triablo_	nickrud	I installed Glib2 but the system doesnt recognize it :(
2006-03-17T09:55:00.000Z	nickrud	triablo_	ok. you're gonna run into a bunch more errors like that, the simplest way to get past most of those will be sudo apt-get build-dep gaim
2006-03-17T09:56:00.000Z	nickrud	triablo_	that will get the development files you're gonna need
2006-03-17T09:57:00.000Z	triablo_	nickrud	thanx
2006-03-17T10:03:00.000Z	triablo_	nickrud	I installed the development files but it gives me the same error: Glib2.0 is required
2006-03-17T10:05:00.000Z	nickrud	triablo_	you could take a look at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/CompileGaim?highlight=%28gaim%29
