2008-09-08T07:00:00.000Z	cheeky		is it possible to install ubuntu with an external HDD?? coz my live cd doesnt work?
2008-09-08T07:00:00.000Z	Flannel	cheeky	Try the alternate CD instead
2008-09-08T07:00:00.000Z	Flannel	cheeky	yes.
2008-09-08T07:01:00.000Z	Flannel	cheeky	It asks the exact same questions.  If it gives you errors while booting, verify the MD5 of the iso you downloaded, and then make sure you burn at the slowest speed you can.
2008-09-08T07:01:00.000Z	Flannel	cheeky	Verify the CD's integrity from the boot menu (penultimate option I believe)
2008-09-08T07:04:00.000Z	Flannel	cheeky	If it booted fine for your friend's computer, its likely a good burn then. What error does it give you while booting?
2008-09-09T00:44:00.000Z	Flannel	cheeky	to be honest, you haven't asked an actual question yet.
2008-09-09T00:45:00.000Z	Flannel	cheeky	yes, you've given us a story, but no problem or question.
2008-09-09T09:49:00.000Z	Flannel	cheeky	hit escape twice, then type :wq
2008-09-09T09:50:00.000Z	cheeky	Flannel	it worked..i guess buti dunno if did save let me check
2008-09-09T09:51:00.000Z	Flannel	cheeky	It wouldn't have closed if it didn't save (would've given you an error message)
2008-09-09T09:52:00.000Z	cheeky	Flannel	thank you

2008-09-09T09:54:00.000Z	Flannel	cheeky	I have no idea what you were editing, so I have no idea.
2008-09-09T09:54:00.000Z	cheeky	Flannel	The /etc/sysctl.conf file
