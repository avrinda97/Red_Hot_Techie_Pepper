2010-02-05T08:11:00.000Z	disappearedng_		Any scp gui options?
2010-02-05T08:11:00.000Z	disappearedng_		I want to be able to just drag and drop
2010-02-05T08:11:00.000Z	maco	disappearedng_	nautilus (the file browser) can connect to servers and do that
2010-02-05T08:12:00.000Z	disappearedng_	maco	oh shit man that's sick
2010-02-05T08:12:00.000Z	maco	disappearedng_	no swearing
2010-08-29T01:06:00.000Z	maco	disappearedng_	if you dont want th ecard to be used at all, just remove it from the machine
2010-08-29T01:06:00.000Z	disappearedng_	maco	my mic isn't working and I suspect the nvidia crap is affecting it
2010-08-29T01:07:00.000Z	maco	disappearedng_	WinstonSmith is trying to tell you hwo to blacklist a module
2010-08-29T01:07:00.000Z	maco	disappearedng_	except if you blacklist snd_hda_intel both would stop working since theyre both azalea chips
2010-08-29T01:08:00.000Z	disappearedng_	maco	yeah so how do I get around that
2010-08-29T01:08:00.000Z	maco	disappearedng_	i'd just install pavucontrol and use it to control which sound card's mic is in use at a given time
2010-08-29T01:10:00.000Z	disappearedng_	maco	under volume control I keep seeing HDMI and Internal Audio analog. Is HDMI something fancy nvidia added on top? If I am not getting my mic working should I disable everything and start from the basic?
2010-08-29T01:11:00.000Z	maco	disappearedng_	hdmi is high-def A/V for like if you want to play something on a high-def TV
2010-08-29T01:11:00.000Z	disappearedng_	maco	I don't need that yet
2010-08-29T01:11:00.000Z	maco	disappearedng_	your graphics card has it built in
2010-08-29T01:12:00.000Z	maco	disappearedng_	probably not, since hdmi is for output
2010-08-29T01:12:00.000Z	disappearedng_	maco	so how would you go about testing for mic no input ?
2010-08-29T01:13:00.000Z	maco	disappearedng_	id double check with pavucontrol that the right device is set for input and then try to use the mic. if the little bars in pavucontrol that show how much input its getting arent moving and you have mic and micboost at 100%, file a bug on the linux package.
