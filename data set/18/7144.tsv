2008-02-01T09:41:00.000Z	apparle		Actually I am a kubuntu user but right now I am installing a Gnome software so I thought I would ask here. 'libbonobo2-common' and 'libbonobo2-0' both depend on each other what should I do ??
2008-02-01T09:42:00.000Z	gmcastil	apparle	let the package manager sort out the dependencies fo ryou
2008-02-01T09:44:00.000Z	gmcastil	apparle	uh.......read the man pages and figure out the right options for apt-get to tell you what packages need to be installed
2008-02-01T09:44:00.000Z	gmcastil	apparle	or...take your box to work or something
2008-02-01T09:50:00.000Z	gmcastil	apparle	wow...thats crazy
2008-02-01T09:51:00.000Z	apparle	gmcastil	When all odds are against you, then to get things done you have to becomne crazy
2008-02-01T09:57:00.000Z	gmcastil	apparle	you can't - go home - go to sleep
2008-02-01T10:00:00.000Z	apparle	gmcastil	If you can't help at least donot discourage people  ;)
2008-02-01T10:00:00.000Z	gmcastil	apparle	you're asking for something that isn't practical
2008-02-01T10:00:00.000Z	gmcastil	apparle	not being discouraging...just stating the obvious truth
2008-02-01T10:01:00.000Z	gmcastil	apparle	get a job and a network connection
2008-02-01T10:02:00.000Z	apparle	gmcastil	I am practically using it for 6 months and will keep using it whatever may be the odds. Because the other option is Windows and it s***s
2008-02-01T10:05:00.000Z	apparle	gmcastil	It seems that kubuntu people are more helping bye
2008-02-01T10:10:00.000Z	apparle	gmcastil	I am joking don't take it seriously. I know you people are helpful
2008-02-01T10:10:00.000Z	gmcastil	apparle	i've been using linux as an admin and user for about 5 years now...just siwtched to ubuntu and this is the first time i've been on these forums
2008-02-01T10:10:00.000Z	gmcastil	apparle	i don't mind helping newbies...i was one once too
2008-02-01T10:11:00.000Z	apparle	gmcastil	Don't worry, I will not remain a newbie for long
2008-02-01T10:11:00.000Z	gmcastil	apparle	but, you'll probably get an earful every now and then - i have high standards
