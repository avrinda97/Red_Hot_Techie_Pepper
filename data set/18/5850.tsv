2009-06-05T01:18:00.000Z	MetaMorfoziS		Hy all
2009-06-05T01:19:00.000Z	MetaMorfoziS		Is that possible to hinernate only one program?
2009-06-05T01:19:00.000Z	MetaMorfoziS		So to store the execution state, then start again?
2009-06-05T01:19:00.000Z	MetaMorfoziS		Maybe to store again from a saved stage more than one times?
2009-06-05T01:19:00.000Z	MetaMorfoziS		restore* again
2009-06-05T01:20:00.000Z	guntbert	MetaMorfoziS	I don't think so, what are you really trying to accomplish?
2009-06-05T01:20:00.000Z	MetaMorfoziS		We have an idiot education system which always frozes and dies when more than 3 people uses it
2009-06-05T01:21:00.000Z	MetaMorfoziS		and tomorrrow will be the subject subscribing
2009-06-05T01:21:00.000Z	MetaMorfoziS		so i want to store a firefox session with opened tabs only waiting for submit
2009-06-05T01:22:00.000Z	MetaMorfoziS		actually i'm thinking on to do that with virtualbox, but that may be overkill
2009-06-05T01:22:00.000Z	MetaMorfoziS		but that can save snapshots/states
2009-06-05T01:23:00.000Z	MetaMorfoziS	jrib	> ?
2009-06-05T01:23:00.000Z	guntbert	MetaMorfoziS	you cannot freeze firefox, but you *could* open such a session in a new window (maybe on a different desktop) and leave it there until you need it
2009-06-05T01:23:00.000Z	MetaMorfoziS		yes but that isn't ok for me
2009-06-05T01:23:00.000Z	MetaMorfoziS		because it uses cookies, and it drops them fast, so i login in one tab fast, then submit the other tab:D
2009-06-05T01:24:00.000Z	MetaMorfoziS		"cool" asp based very expensive and useless system.
2009-06-05T01:24:00.000Z	MetaMorfoziS		okay, so i need hibernation like an os does that
2009-06-05T01:24:00.000Z	guntbert	MetaMorfoziS	then I'm out of ideas (except like you said a VM)
