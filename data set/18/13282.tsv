2005-12-13T06:05:00.000Z	Jowi	n1nj4-TaNten	you must install sudo on some distros for it to work. 'sudo' is optional in Slackware as well.
2005-12-13T06:11:00.000Z	Jowi	n1nj4-TaNten	apt-get update
2005-12-13T06:12:00.000Z	Jowi	n1nj4-TaNten	yes. so that apt reloads your sources.list
2005-12-13T06:13:00.000Z	Jowi	n1nj4-TaNten	why don't you just install ubuntu on another partition to try it out?
2005-12-13T06:13:00.000Z	n1nj4-TaNten	Jowi	becaus i have just installed debain bevause i dont have any cd-rom
2005-12-13T06:13:00.000Z	Jowi	n1nj4-TaNten	ah. ok.
2005-12-13T06:15:00.000Z	Jowi	n1nj4-TaNten	if you can log in as root, why do you need sudo?
2005-12-13T06:16:00.000Z	Jowi	n1nj4-TaNten	if you can edit sources.list you already are root
