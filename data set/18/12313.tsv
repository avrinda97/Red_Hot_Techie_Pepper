2006-06-01T07:37:00.000Z	theine	Ocult	how do you try to change the screen resolution?
2006-06-01T07:37:00.000Z	Ocult		>thefish<: system. preferences. screenresoltion
2006-06-01T07:38:00.000Z	Ocult		((theine)): system. preferences. screenresoltion
2006-06-01T07:38:00.000Z	Ocult		[theine] : all be strange..
2006-06-01T07:38:00.000Z	Ocult		[theine] : in breezy that work good
2006-06-01T07:38:00.000Z	theine	Ocult	try "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" and hit enter until you reach the screen where you can change the screen resolution
2006-06-01T07:39:00.000Z	theine	Ocult	try the dpkg-reconfigure thing and i'm fairly sure the gnome tool will then work as expected too
2006-06-01T07:39:00.000Z	Ocult		[theine] : it work in livecd ?
2006-06-01T07:39:00.000Z	theine	Ocult	oh, you're using the live CD?
2006-06-01T07:40:00.000Z	Ocult		((theine)): if i install the same problem happen
2006-06-01T07:40:00.000Z	Ocult		Hey, theine: i just cant understand why in breezy i dont have this problem
2006-06-01T07:41:00.000Z	theine	Ocult	i'm sure it'll work one you install Ubuntu to hard disk
2006-06-01T07:41:00.000Z	Ocult		[theine] : but u know this problem i said ?
2006-06-01T07:41:00.000Z	theine	Ocult	no, but i have a feeling
2006-06-01T07:42:00.000Z	theine	Ocult	really, don't worry about, if it still doesn't work after you installed Ubuntu, and I'm sure there are many people who'll be able to help you resolving the problem
2006-06-01T07:43:00.000Z	Ocult	theine	thanks
