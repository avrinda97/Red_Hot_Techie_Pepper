2008-01-01T21:55:00.000Z	iblicf	Jack_Sparrow	 o ..that's i t , ..
2008-01-01T21:55:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	iblicf	Thats the easy way... one of them
2008-01-01T21:56:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	iblicf	Ubuntu does not have the copy protection which is what keeps you from doing it with windows
2008-01-01T21:56:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	iblicf	Even if there are some differences with the hardware, you can still do it and it will or should auto detect.. at worst you have to reconfig xorg
2008-01-01T21:58:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	iblicf	  Let me link cloning help for you...
2008-01-01T21:58:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	iblicf	You can also type man dd      are the drives all the same size?
2008-01-01T22:03:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	iblicf	Sorry, I was busy elsewhere..   Are you trying to copy windows as well?
2008-01-01T22:04:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	iblicf	I was trying to find a link I had for dd...  give me one more minute

2008-01-01T22:05:00.000Z	iblicf	Jack_Sparrow	 ok , i think , maybe there is only way ... completely dd
2008-01-01T22:06:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	iblicf	Depending on how much stuff you are trying to include, you could create a tar on one or more dvd's
2008-01-01T22:07:00.000Z	iblicf	Jack_Sparrow	 if use USB , there must be a 2-3G ...size
2008-01-01T22:08:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	iblicf	Yep  I have it on a 4 with plenty of spare room
2008-01-01T22:08:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	iblicf	Needless to say, you have a lot of options...
