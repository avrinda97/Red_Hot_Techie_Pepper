2012-08-20T07:09:00.000Z	L3top	benniestacks	reboot and see if it is better
2012-08-20T07:18:00.000Z	benniestacks	L3top	i'm back. Still not working :-/
2012-08-20T07:19:00.000Z	L3top	benniestacks	I dont remember the initial problem
2012-08-20T07:21:00.000Z	benniestacks	L3top	I can't change the screen brightness but more importantly if I close the screen I can't resume because of a blacked out screen.
2012-08-20T07:22:00.000Z	L3top	benniestacks	then all I have done is make your graphics work better... nothing to do with brightness... that is an acpi thing I suspect and am of no use to you... sorry
2012-08-20T07:23:00.000Z	benniestacks	L3top	is Awesome!
