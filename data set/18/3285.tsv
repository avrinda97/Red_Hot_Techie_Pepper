2009-11-03T04:20:00.000Z	nyne		If i want to set up network authentication at home is ldap the best way to go ? I have Mac and Ubuntu desktops/notebooks
2009-11-03T04:20:00.000Z	nyne		I'm running ubuntu server 9.04
2009-11-03T04:21:00.000Z	matreya6	nyne	LDAP is very nice, especially on a large (wireless) network (RADIUS!) . It takes some configuration though.
2009-11-03T04:21:00.000Z	nyne	matreya6	I have a mix of wireless (g&&n) and wired (gigabit)
2009-11-03T04:22:00.000Z	matreya6	nyne	nice!, how many stations are attached to your LAN?
2009-11-03T04:23:00.000Z	nyne	matreya6	right now i've got 6 running osx and 2 boxes running ubuntu
2009-11-03T04:25:00.000Z	matreya6	nyne	sounds like a nice network indeed. If you go into the trouble of setting up LDAP combined with a radius server, that's about the safest option you can choose (provided you use WPA2 of course).
2009-11-03T04:26:00.000Z	nyne	matreya6	how would the wired machines log on to the network? I want to be able to have a central home directory for everyone so I'd either export nfs or netatalk (or a combination of the two)
2009-11-03T04:26:00.000Z	matreya6	nyne	the nice thing about LDAP is that you can roam freely on the network when logging in. The disadvantage is that you need to have your LDAP/ radius server running at all times.
2009-11-03T04:28:00.000Z	matreya6	nyne	the wired computers should use pam_LDAP to authenticate to your central LDAP-server.
2009-11-03T04:29:00.000Z	nyne	matreya6	ah okay great. I have been having trouble getting everything to work properly. i can query the ldap server with slapcat and ldapsearch but am still unable to authenticate to it. i've installed ldapscripts and can use ldapadduesr ldapmodifyuser etc without problem but when i try to login using one of those created accounts -- no dice
2009-11-03T04:30:00.000Z	matreya6	nyne	it takes a while to setup, but it's great, especially when coupled with radius, nfs and local DNS
2009-11-03T04:31:00.000Z	nyne	matreya6	I need to spend a bit more time getting dns set up properly. I have been using /etc/hosts and it's really doing my head in. I am trying to build things one step at a time so not to over complicate things
2009-11-03T04:31:00.000Z	nyne	matreya6	there are a few things on the ubuntu guide that have me a bit confused
2009-11-03T04:31:00.000Z	matreya6	nyne	true, for a small static network a hosts file is a simple alternative indeed.
2009-11-03T04:33:00.000Z	matreya6	nyne	maybe I can help you with that, but I doubt it. I am enthousiastic about this combination because it has been implemented where I work and I know it to work comfortably. I have never set it up myself :-/
2009-11-03T04:34:00.000Z	nyne	matreya6	as of now i am working at a company that has sort of outgrown its authentication mechanism (standard growing pains) and i am hoping to learn a bit about openldap so to get away from passwd/shadow editing using puppet on hundreds of hosts... i sort of joined the company and realized what they were doing and was frightened lol
2009-11-03T04:37:00.000Z	matreya6	nyne	Good show! This will definitely impress your staff once you get it up and running. One disadvantage is that the machines will become totally dependent on that LDAP server, if it goes down, no one can login anymore. That is, if you use LDAP login exclusively.
