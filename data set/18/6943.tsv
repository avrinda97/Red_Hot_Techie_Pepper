2008-02-29T02:31:00.000Z	bunts	daef	shutdown -h now
2008-02-29T02:31:00.000Z	daef	bunts	i'm workin' on a windows-machine right now... it should be "shutdown -s -f -t 0"
2008-02-29T02:32:00.000Z	bunts	daef	on windows machine - hammer it now :)
2008-02-29T02:33:00.000Z	daef	bunts	on my companie's notebook windows is a must have - and 80gigs - windows does not really leave enough space for a usable linux ;)
2008-02-29T02:35:00.000Z	bunts	daef	I see, then ther`s no other solution to use linux :)
2008-02-29T02:36:00.000Z	daef	bunts	i could walk into the next room and use my pc - which wouldn't let me watch tv besides... or i could ssh onto it or my router via putty... but sometimes text isn't the one and only truth ;)
2008-02-29T02:37:00.000Z	bunts	daef	yeah, agree with ya :)

2008-02-29T02:48:00.000Z	bunts	daef	probably u know where I can configure my laptop touchpad sensitivity?
2008-02-29T02:50:00.000Z	daef	bunts	i guess it depends on which touchpad you use... maybe in the mouse-settings?? or in your driverconfig?
2008-02-29T02:51:00.000Z	daef	bunts	why that questions?
2008-02-29T02:52:00.000Z	bunts	daef	in mouse-settings there`s no option like that, probably yes, in driver conf. do u know where s that? no just wonder where I can configure out, `cause is too sensitive
2008-02-29T02:53:00.000Z	daef	bunts	just asking because your first problem (vpn) seems like you are a quite advanced user - and the touchpad-problem seems - compared - trivial ;)
2008-02-29T02:54:00.000Z	daef	bunts	is it a synaptics-pad??
2008-02-29T02:55:00.000Z	bunts	daef	advanced in ways :) just now wanted to sort it out. thx
2008-02-29T02:55:00.000Z	daef	bunts	when it is a synaptics-pad then this one could help: http://tinyurl.com/yt7qxt
2008-02-29T02:55:00.000Z	daef	bunts	i know that prob ;)
2008-02-29T02:55:00.000Z	bunts	daef	thx
