2010-04-10T08:30:00.000Z	Captain_Long		When I'm booting it tells me to go to a certain website to install these drivers or something, but it goes by too quickly for me to catch it.
2010-04-10T08:30:00.000Z	ziroday	Captain_Long	is it a graphical popup or a text message?
2010-04-10T08:31:00.000Z	ziroday	Captain_Long	okay, can you pastebin your /var/log/syslog, the message should be in there
2010-04-10T08:33:00.000Z	ziroday	Captain_Long	ah. Wired or wireless?
2010-04-10T08:33:00.000Z	ziroday	Captain_Long	okay, what wireless card?
2010-04-10T08:33:00.000Z	ziroday	Captain_Long	and what version of ubuntu
2010-04-10T08:34:00.000Z	Captain_Long	ziroday	I couldn't tell you the card, but it's 9.10
2010-04-10T08:34:00.000Z	ziroday	Captain_Long	sure, if you do lspci | grep -i network you should see some mention of a wireless card
2010-04-10T08:37:00.000Z	ziroday	Captain_Long	oh sure sorry, Go to Applications > Terminal and then type in "lspci" and search for any mention of your wireless card
2010-04-10T08:39:00.000Z	ziroday	Captain_Long	sure, what does it say?
2010-04-10T08:40:00.000Z	ziroday	Captain_Long	perfect, that's your wireless card. Now how did you install ubuntu?
2010-04-10T08:42:00.000Z	ziroday	Captain_Long	ah right, well if you are still on the livecd then you probably can't install the drivers to get the wireless card working as it requires a reboot. However I'm reasonably certain that card works with ubuntu
2010-04-10T08:43:00.000Z	ziroday	Captain_Long	key?
2010-04-10T08:44:00.000Z	ziroday	Captain_Long	ah yes, when it says key it means password. Is this a WEP encrypted access point?
2010-04-10T08:46:00.000Z	ziroday	Captain_Long	sure, no worries then
2010-04-10T08:48:00.000Z	ziroday	Captain_Long	not that I know off, only wpa2-enterprise can get a little sticky, but I doubt you are using that
2010-04-10T08:49:00.000Z	ziroday	Captain_Long	awesome! Basically after you've installed you need to re-insert the CD and add it as a software source in System > Administration > Software Sources and then run System > Hardware Drivers
2010-04-10T08:49:00.000Z	ziroday	Captain_Long	give it a sec :)
