2010-01-03T04:09:00.000Z	Bwarf		When I type two keys too fast on my keyboard (I am a fast typer) almost simultaneously, Ubuntu sometimes gets the wrong order
2010-01-03T04:09:00.000Z	Bwarf		e.g. space always comes before any key
2010-01-03T04:09:00.000Z	Bwarf		if another key is pressed too quickly before it
2010-01-03T04:09:00.000Z	Bwarf		so I type thing slik ethi soften
2010-01-03T04:10:00.000Z	Bwarf		for example
2010-01-03T04:10:00.000Z	Bwarf		try pressing all asdf keys together in any editor
2010-01-03T04:10:00.000Z	Bwarf		you'll ALWAYS get 'asdf'
2010-01-03T04:10:00.000Z	Bwarf		even if you press it in reverse order but really fast
2010-01-03T04:11:00.000Z	Bwarf		In Ubuntu 9.10, if you press the keys 'asdf' in the reverse order (f, d, s, a) but do it REALLY fast, you'll still get typed 'asdf' and not 'fdsa'.
2010-01-03T04:12:00.000Z	Bwarf		In Ubuntu 9.10, if you press the keys 'asdf' in the reverse order (f, d, s, a) but do it REALLY fast, you'll still get typed 'asdf' and not 'fdsa'. For fast typers this is a problem as although we press a certain key before some other key timely, it still gets typed in the wrong position. So we have to slow down.
