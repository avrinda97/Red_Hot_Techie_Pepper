2008-06-10T19:39:00.000Z	Gemmie78		Fantastic, restoring the notification area works like a treat, fantastic, I'm so happy
2008-06-10T19:40:00.000Z	Gemmie78		I've been slowly tweaking my ubuntu
2008-06-10T19:40:00.000Z	Gemmie78		This is so much better than other OS's and I didn't have to pay a single cent
2008-06-10T19:40:00.000Z	Gemmie78		I want to run Kubuntu for my mum on a really old laptop
2008-06-10T19:40:00.000Z	Gemmie78		I think it would be fine
2008-06-10T19:41:00.000Z	Gemmie78		Yeah I need to get more familiar
2008-06-10T19:41:00.000Z	Gemmie78		Is there a way to have my mum automatically have firestarter running
2008-06-10T19:42:00.000Z	Gemmie78		Is it possible to have the program always run, or run as soon as the computer boots
2008-06-10T19:44:00.000Z	Gemmie78		Really?
2008-06-10T19:44:00.000Z	Gemmie78		Is it always on?
2008-06-10T19:44:00.000Z	rampageoberon	Gemmie78	the default firewall is iptables which is always on
2008-06-10T19:46:00.000Z	rampageoberon	Gemmie78	its just a front end, some people like guis
2008-06-10T19:46:00.000Z	rampageoberon	Gemmie78	personally i still prefer iptables from command line, rather than ufw
2008-06-10T19:47:00.000Z	rampageoberon	Gemmie78	yes
2008-06-10T19:47:00.000Z	rampageoberon	Gemmie78	yes, firestarter just passes on the rules to iptables
2008-06-10T19:48:00.000Z	rampageoberon	Gemmie78	My suggestion would be if using iptables, script the firewall. iptables directly gives you a lot more control
2008-06-10T19:48:00.000Z	rampageoberon	Gemmie78	you have to wrote the script
2008-06-10T19:49:00.000Z	rampageoberon	Gemmie78	unless you are installing any of the things Myrtti mentioned the default config is good enough
