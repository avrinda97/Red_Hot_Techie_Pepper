2005-01-05T10:06:00.000Z	occy		needed the reg #  that was on the cd
2005-01-05T10:06:00.000Z	occy		Could never get that java working :(
2005-01-05T10:07:00.000Z	merriam	occy	you want to use windows just for java?
2005-01-05T10:07:00.000Z	occy	merriam	Do I want to?  Um, no.
2005-01-05T10:08:00.000Z	occy	merriam	I've had several people look at it, and noone can figure out the problem with Java on Firefox / Opera / Konq  My dad needs to use this one java app for his work, and I really want them to use Linux, sooo....
2005-01-05T10:09:00.000Z	merriam	occy	If Java won't work on Ubuntu (I haven't tried), it's probably easier to use Gentoo.  chroot is preferable to emulation.
2005-01-05T10:10:00.000Z	occy	merriam	heh, Java works fine, I can use yahoo games.  It just doesn't work with My Dad's work's website.
2005-01-05T10:10:00.000Z	merriam	occy	which java?
2005-01-05T10:10:00.000Z	occy	merriam	1.5.0_01
2005-01-05T10:11:00.000Z	occy	merriam	tried 1.4.2 as well
2005-01-05T10:16:00.000Z	merriam	occy	Which implementation, not which version.  Sun, I presume.  You could try IBM, or perhaps an older version than 1.4.2.
2005-01-05T10:16:00.000Z	merriam	occy	or Blackdown
2005-01-05T10:17:00.000Z	occy	merriam	I tried blackdown and also the multiverse version as well as Sun's
2005-01-05T10:18:00.000Z	occy	merriam	you understand now why I'm using qemu?
2005-01-05T10:19:00.000Z	merriam	occy	yes.  Good luck.
2005-05-13T09:05:00.000Z	merriam	occy	does it lock up at any particular time?
2005-05-13T09:06:00.000Z	occy	merriam	doesn't seem to.
2005-05-13T09:10:00.000Z	merriam	occy	tried turning of sounds for events?
