2011-02-22T10:32:00.000Z	gmachine_24		There is a program or utility that will list major files for you............ but it escapes me at the moment.
2011-02-22T10:33:00.000Z	gmachine_24		you go to the directory and do sudo apt-get rm <filenametoremove>
2011-02-22T10:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gmachine_24	why is apt-get needed for folder removal??
2011-02-22T10:35:00.000Z	gmachine_24	ActionParsnip	good question. It all depends really on the permissions the dl program/pgk has.
2011-02-22T10:36:00.000Z	gmachine_24	ActionParsnip	when you dl a debian package I believe it comes with permissions that only allow the su to ex, read, write, etc.
2011-02-22T10:36:00.000Z	gmachine_24	ActionParsnip	if you change the permissions to give users free reign, then you can probably remove the original file/package without using sudo
2011-02-22T10:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gmachine_24	yes, but apt-get isn't needed to rm a directory.
2011-02-22T10:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gmachine_24	so why not just: rm -r folder-or-filname-here
2011-04-23T03:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gmachine_24	you ca dual boot, you will just choose between the kernels at bootup which defines the release
2011-05-29T23:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gmachine_24	if it is ext based filesystem, you can use partimage
2011-05-29T23:00:00.000Z	gmachine_24	ActionParsnip	it is ext3
2011-05-29T23:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gmachine_24	partimage will work well
2011-05-29T23:01:00.000Z	gmachine_24	ActionParsnip	Ok. Which I can run from within Ubuntu, right? No need to have a separate boot CD or anything?
2011-05-29T23:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gmachine_24	if the partition can be unmounted then it can be used
2011-05-29T23:03:00.000Z	gmachine_24	ActionParsnip	Ok, yes, it can be. It's an entire drive - separate from the OS drive, etc. Ok, thanks.
2012-02-29T21:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gmachine_24	add the boot option:  text

2012-11-19T09:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gmachine_24	could use rsync. If the partition is a system partition which you are booted to, you will need to use a liveCD
