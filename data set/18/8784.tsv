2007-06-24T13:24:00.000Z	ubuntu_aa		I booted ubuntu live cd to fix broken sysstem on hda
2007-06-24T13:25:00.000Z	ubuntu_aa		but ubuntu livecd doesnt see my hard drive, there is no file /dev/hda wtf
2007-06-24T13:25:00.000Z	Flannel	ubuntu_aa	it'd be /dev/hda1 (for the first partition on hda)
2007-06-24T13:25:00.000Z	ubuntu_aa		 # ls /dev/hd?
2007-06-24T13:25:00.000Z	ubuntu_aa		/dev/hdb
2007-06-24T13:26:00.000Z	ubuntu_aa		it sees only my cdrom
2007-06-24T13:26:00.000Z	ubuntu_aa		but not ATA
2007-06-24T13:26:00.000Z	Flannel	ubuntu_aa	hdb is your CDrom?
2007-06-24T13:26:00.000Z	ubuntu_aa	Flannel	yea
2007-06-24T13:27:00.000Z	Flannel	ubuntu_aa	you're right.  your harddrive (assuming it's IDE) isn't showing up.  Are you sure it's an IDE drive?
2007-06-24T13:27:00.000Z	ubuntu_aa		Flanne yeaaa
2007-06-24T13:27:00.000Z	ubuntu_aa		Flanne - LIVE cd ubuntu do create /dev/hda and so on if harddrive is connected??
2007-06-24T13:27:00.000Z	Flannel	ubuntu_aa	no.  Turn it off, open up the system, check your connections.
2007-06-24T13:28:00.000Z	ubuntu_aa		Flannel so you say it must be a hardware problem?
2007-06-24T13:28:00.000Z	Flannel	ubuntu_aa	yes.  Otherwise you'd see /dev/hda
2007-06-24T13:28:00.000Z	ubuntu_aa		ok
2007-06-24T13:28:00.000Z	Flannel	ubuntu_aa	if you want, reboot, look in the BIOS to see if you see it.
