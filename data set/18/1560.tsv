2012-04-07T23:22:00.000Z	user82		can someone tell me how to rename all files in a folder via shell...to a random name(yes a random name dont ask why ^^)
2012-04-07T23:22:00.000Z	mbeierl	user82	randomize each name?  or just to a random directory?
2012-04-07T23:24:00.000Z	mbeierl	user82	in the shell, you can do a command over and over per file with: for name in *.ext ; do echo file name is $file ; done
2012-04-07T23:24:00.000Z	mbeierl	user82	you would then need to have it generate a random name per file.  Is there a common extension and did you want to preserve the extension at all?
2012-04-07T23:25:00.000Z	user82	mbeierl	to explain those are mp3 files on a player that does not shuffle(china 4$)...so i want to do it that way
2012-04-07T23:25:00.000Z	mbeierl	user82	ok. gimme a minute and I'll come up with a one liner for you.  Are there subdirectories too?
2012-04-07T23:26:00.000Z	user82	mbeierl	no all in one folder. thanks for your help!
2012-04-07T23:26:00.000Z	mbeierl	user82	np.  I just need to decide on a good randomizer :)
2012-04-07T23:39:00.000Z	mbeierl	user82	with thanks to urbancommando for making sure I did not over-write any existing names: http://paste.ubuntu.com/919388/
2012-04-07T23:39:00.000Z	mbeierl	user82	but, because it's reading /dev/random, it's not the fastest thing in the word.
2012-04-07T23:40:00.000Z	mbeierl	user82	Sorry - you need to add the actual "mv" command to the script.  Right now it just echos out what it's going to do
2012-04-07T23:41:00.000Z	mbeierl	user82	http://paste.ubuntu.com/919399/
2012-04-07T23:46:00.000Z	user82	mbeierl	thank you!
2012-04-07T23:47:00.000Z	mbeierl	user82	you're welcome.  Not sure how long it'll take though.  I need to think if there's a better way to get a random number...
2012-04-07T23:52:00.000Z	mbeierl	user82	replace the very first "random=" with this:  random=`md5sum "$file" | cut -d\  -f1`
2012-04-07T23:53:00.000Z	mbeierl	user82	like so: http://paste.ubuntu.com/919417/
2012-04-08T00:17:00.000Z	user82	mbeierl	its working right now...nice
2012-04-08T00:38:00.000Z	mbeierl	user82	glad it's working.  Just a note: the change I made to that script uses the MD5 hash as the target name to make it quicker. However, if you run it again and the MD5 hash file name already exists, it will fall back to the slow version and generate a random name by using /dev/random
