2006-07-19T13:23:00.000Z	Imme-emosol		I want the most stable one, one hd-dead is enough... :p   ext3? Or something else?
2006-07-19T13:25:00.000Z	Imme-emosol		So zfs is not supported a.t.m. ?
2006-07-19T13:26:00.000Z	Imme-emosol		ah okay, to compete with ntfs ?
2006-07-19T13:28:00.000Z	Imme-emosol		is zfs Sun's reaction to the ntfs ?
2006-07-19T13:28:00.000Z	Imme-emosol		linux_user: I'm going to format my drive, so that's why I asked. :)
2006-07-19T13:29:00.000Z	Imme-emosol		From what I've read I concluded kde is more stable...
2006-07-19T13:29:00.000Z	Imme-emosol		ext2 or ext3 IS something different. :p
2006-07-19T13:30:00.000Z	Imme-emosol		But since it isn't build upon gpl completely like gnome, I prefer gnome.
2006-07-19T13:32:00.000Z	Imme-emosol		Wait a sec...   ext2 or 3 or reiser are not compatible with windows or macos?
2006-07-19T13:34:00.000Z	Imme-emosol		coorporating = co-operating :S
2006-07-19T13:34:00.000Z	mneptok	Imme-emosol	there is an XP driver for ext2/3
2006-07-19T13:34:00.000Z	mneptok	Imme-emosol	MacOSX only supports HFS, HFS+, UFS, and FAT32
2006-07-19T13:35:00.000Z	Imme-emosol	mneptok	macOsX no Fat16?
2006-07-19T13:35:00.000Z	mneptok	Imme-emosol	not AFAIK. but maybe.
2006-07-19T13:35:00.000Z	mneptok	Imme-emosol	GIYF
2006-07-19T13:36:00.000Z	Imme-emosol	mneptok	gimf, but firefox isn't a.t.m. so...
2006-07-19T13:37:00.000Z	mneptok	Imme-emosol	"About the Mac OS X 10.3.9 Update (Delta) .... Addresses a rare issue in which a file could become damaged when copying to a FAT16- or FAT32-formatted volume."
2006-07-19T13:38:00.000Z	mneptok	Imme-emosol	so apparently, yes
