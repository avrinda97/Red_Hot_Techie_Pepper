2007-01-26T12:26:00.000Z	bmk		whenever i put a linux disk in, windows trs to read it and goes crazy
2007-01-26T12:26:00.000Z	cablesm102	bmk	are you booting from the CD?
2007-01-26T12:27:00.000Z	cablesm102	bmk	have you made sure you burned the ISO as an image and not as a file?
2007-01-26T12:28:00.000Z	cablesm102	bmk	if the BIOS refuses to try to load the OS from the CD, it's a BIOS issue. Or a CD drive issue.
2007-01-26T12:29:00.000Z	cablesm102	bmk	there are supposed to be files on the Ubuntu disk, even from the Windows side
2007-01-26T12:29:00.000Z	cablesm102	bmk	try  burning the disk on another comp
2007-01-26T12:30:00.000Z	cablesm102	bmk	what brand of disk do you use?
2007-01-26T12:31:00.000Z	cablesm102	bmk	i'm not joking... some brands suck and don't burn well
2007-01-26T12:32:00.000Z	cablesm102	bmk	i think your computers just hate you :)
2007-01-26T12:38:00.000Z	cablesm102	bmk	i think I see numbers!
2007-01-26T12:40:00.000Z	cablesm102	bmk	I think your burned disk sucks. Burn the disk on another comp, or with different media.
2007-01-26T12:41:00.000Z	cablesm102	bmk	there was a chart somewhere. I use imation, works for me. Tell me what brand you're using, I might be able to recognize a bad one
