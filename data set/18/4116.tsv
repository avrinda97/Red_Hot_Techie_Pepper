2009-06-03T07:18:00.000Z	cabrey		then you can uninstall it :)

2009-06-03T08:45:00.000Z	losher	cabrey	I believe catman is a cache for man pages so you don't keep reformatting them from source to display them
2009-06-03T08:45:00.000Z	cabrey	losher	makes sense
2009-06-03T08:47:00.000Z	cabrey	losher	first i want to get the module installed
2009-06-03T08:58:00.000Z	losher	cabrey	checkinstall was broken for a while, but then fixed. The latest one seems to work ok...
2009-06-03T09:31:00.000Z	cabrey	losher	thats an interesting analogy lol
2009-06-03T09:37:00.000Z	losher	cabrey	I didn't make the analogy up. Meatloaf had an album in 1977. The phrase itself dates back to 414 BC (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bat_out_of_Hell). There's a wikipedia page for everything nowadays, isn't there...
2009-06-03T09:37:00.000Z	cabrey	losher	haha i stand corrected
2009-06-10T10:44:00.000Z	losher	cabrey	good...

2009-06-12T08:41:00.000Z	losher	cabrey	sometimes *I* can't pass the captcha. And I have friends who I think would fail a Turing test...
2009-06-19T02:20:00.000Z	cabrey	losher	it's in /opt/cxoffice
2009-06-19T02:20:00.000Z	losher	cabrey	depends on how you installed it I think i.e. systemwide or per-user
2009-06-19T02:21:00.000Z	cabrey	losher	ah good point, i always run standalone installers as root, just in case
