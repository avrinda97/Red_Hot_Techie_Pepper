2012-11-16T04:08:00.000Z	daveinlv		I recently did a clean install of 12.04 64bit and have an issue with Audacious. It will not play any shoutcast music streams, but does play MP3 files on the machine. I've installed all of the codecs from medibuntu, and a package from the webupd8 ppa entitled "audacious-plugins". Rhythmbox on the same machine plays every shoutcast mp3 stream I've thrown at it, but I really don't care to use that for listening to streams. I know Ubuntu
2012-11-16T04:08:00.000Z	daveinlv		is missing a lot of codecs because of patents, but I thought the medibuntu cache fixed those issues.. Help?
2012-11-16T04:09:00.000Z	daveinlv		I think so.. will check..
2012-11-16T04:11:00.000Z	daveinlv		chartax_  According to synaptic, I have..
2012-11-16T04:12:00.000Z	daveinlv		ok.. will check over there... ty!!
2012-11-16T04:13:00.000Z	daveinlv		They all use the same mp3 codecs then I gather?
2012-11-16T04:15:00.000Z	daveinlv		I''ll try completely removing it and reinstalling.. havent tried that yet..
2012-11-16T04:15:00.000Z	daveinlv		thanks, Chartax_
2012-11-16T04:15:00.000Z	beandog	daveinlv	there's a couple of mp3 codecs you can use for playback
2012-11-16T04:15:00.000Z	daveinlv	beandog	Oh?
2012-11-16T04:16:00.000Z	beandog	daveinlv	there's lavc, lame, and ... I can't remember the other off the top of my head
2012-11-16T04:16:00.000Z	beandog	daveinlv	what are you trying to do?
2012-11-16T04:17:00.000Z	daveinlv	beandog	what has me baffled is the fact that audacious plays local mp3 files just fine.. just won't play a standard http://server:port shoutcast url
2012-11-16T04:17:00.000Z	beandog	daveinlv	oh okay, well it could be another codec from shoutcast
2012-11-16T04:17:00.000Z	daveinlv	beandog	Oh? different from the decoder for local mp3 files?
2012-11-16T04:18:00.000Z	beandog	daveinlv	no, I mean the shoutcast playlist may not be serving MP3
2012-11-16T04:19:00.000Z	daveinlv		beandog.. I sure HOPE it is, as I run the shoutcast station that I'm trying to listen to.. in testing I tried others and they don't work either
2012-11-16T04:19:00.000Z	beandog	daveinlv	wanna pm me the url?
