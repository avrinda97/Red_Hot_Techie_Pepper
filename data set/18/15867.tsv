2005-01-16T10:26:00.000Z	xed		can someone briefly explain to me what the use of the swap partition is?
2005-01-16T10:26:00.000Z	ycco	xed	when you run out of ran, it uses disc space.
2005-01-16T10:26:00.000Z	ycco		errr disk space.
2005-01-16T10:26:00.000Z	ycco		ugh
2005-01-16T10:26:00.000Z	ycco		when you run out of ram.
2005-01-16T10:26:00.000Z	xed		ram?
2005-01-16T10:27:00.000Z	ycco		:)
2005-01-16T10:27:00.000Z	xed		Oh..
2005-01-16T10:27:00.000Z	xed		Maybe I should've made a larger swap partition then...?
2005-01-16T10:27:00.000Z	ycco	xed	how much ram do you have?
2005-01-16T10:27:00.000Z	xed		512 =\
2005-01-16T10:27:00.000Z	xed		ddr
2005-01-16T10:27:00.000Z	ycco	xed	1G swap is fine (512 meg is fine too)
2005-01-16T10:27:00.000Z	xed		and I think 64 is used by ATI card. =\
2005-01-16T10:28:00.000Z	ycco	xed	typicaly you double your ram and that's your swap....   but... anything bigger than a 2Gig swap on a desktop box is silly.
2005-01-16T10:28:00.000Z	ycco		(anything bigger than 1 gig swap seems silly to me)
2005-01-16T10:28:00.000Z	xed	ycco	so it uses the harddrive space.. like it would with the RAM?
2005-01-16T10:28:00.000Z	ycco	xed	from my understanding yes, it uses your hd space when you run out of ram.
