2011-05-30T23:53:00.000Z	tdb30_		Anyone know why unity won't load.  Compiz says it is because I am using software rendering but every test I've done shows I'm using hardware rendering?
2011-05-30T23:53:00.000Z	tdb30_		OpenGL renderer string: Mesa X11
2011-05-30T23:54:00.000Z	Kalisto	tdb30_	what graphics card are you using?
2011-05-30T23:55:00.000Z	Kalisto	tdb30_	try: lspci | grep VGA
2011-05-30T23:57:00.000Z	Kalisto	tdb30_	have you run the restricted driver search?
2011-05-30T23:58:00.000Z	Kalisto	tdb30_	ok System->Admin Addional drivers
2011-05-30T23:58:00.000Z	Kalisto	tdb30_	did it find any drivers?
2011-05-30T23:59:00.000Z	Kalisto	tdb30_	ok log out, and at the bottom select ubuntu classic (dont know my way around unit)
2011-05-31T00:02:00.000Z	Kalisto	tdb30_	is there a way to search?
2011-05-31T00:09:00.000Z	Kalisto	tdb30_	ok log out of the session. bottom of screen select classic theme. log in again and look for System->....
2011-05-31T00:10:00.000Z	Kalisto	tdb30_	ok sec
2011-05-31T00:12:00.000Z	Kalisto	tdb30_	run this in terminal: /usr/bin/jockey-gtk
2011-05-31T00:15:00.000Z	Kalisto	tdb30_	so it also did not find any?
2011-05-31T00:17:00.000Z	Kalisto	tdb30_	check intel website for current linux driver
2011-05-31T00:17:00.000Z	Kalisto	tdb30_	check if they are legacy drivers or if current kernel and X supports them
2011-05-31T00:20:00.000Z	Kalisto	tdb30_	oh and check here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedDrivers
2011-05-31T00:55:00.000Z	Kalisto	tdb30_	yes this is a common problem with older graphics cards that are no longer fully supported, best is to stay away from unit and compiz, so log out, then bottom of login screen select the classic ubuntu and log back in
2011-05-31T00:55:00.000Z	Kalisto	tdb30_	having done that check Compiz themes are fully turned off. == much faster pc
