2010-06-17T22:15:00.000Z	futurizm		i tried to set the vga driver from vesa to sis as all the threads say, but when I restart i get an error msg telling me that it'unable
2010-06-17T22:15:00.000Z	futurizm		*unable to load driver
2010-06-17T22:16:00.000Z	zkriesse	futurizm	hmmm

2010-06-17T22:16:00.000Z	futurizm	zkriesse	I tried but my settings menu says Unknown Monitor, Unknown Video Graphics, et etc
2010-06-17T22:16:00.000Z	futurizm		yes i have internet since i'm connected to irc atm from my ubuntu system :)
2010-06-17T22:16:00.000Z	zkriesse	futurizm	Ok, you might need a proprietary driver
2010-06-17T22:17:00.000Z	futurizm		yes but the one everyone say as proper driver, gives me the 'unable to load driver' error msg
2010-06-17T22:17:00.000Z	zkriesse	futurizm	please run the command without quotes in your terminal "lspci" and post the output in pastebin
2010-06-17T22:18:00.000Z	zkriesse	futurizm	the link is http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/
2010-06-17T22:18:00.000Z	zkriesse	futurizm	Don't EVER do that
2010-06-17T22:20:00.000Z	zkriesse	futurizm	hmm
2010-06-17T22:20:00.000Z	zkriesse	futurizm	it's got me a bit fuzzled
2010-06-17T22:22:00.000Z	futurizm	zkriesse	what?
2010-06-17T22:27:00.000Z	zkriesse	futurizm	I'm afraid I don't know exactly what's affecting you atm
2010-06-17T22:29:00.000Z	futurizm	zkriesse	it's simple. 800x600 sucks, and if i set the driver in xorg.conf from'vesa' to 'sis' it gives me an error message telling me 'unable to load driver'
