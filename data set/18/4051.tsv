2009-12-31T05:50:00.000Z	Guest88887		I did
2009-12-31T05:50:00.000Z	Guest88887		it says No such file or directory
2009-12-31T05:50:00.000Z	Guest88887		I'm open to the universe and multiverse
2009-12-31T05:51:00.000Z	ctmjr	Guest88887	then you are doing something wrong it is there
2009-12-31T05:53:00.000Z	ctmjr	Guest88887	you need to run an update first
2009-12-31T06:03:00.000Z	ctmjr	Guest88887	you added universe repo did you run aptitude update ?
2009-12-31T06:07:00.000Z	ctmjr	Guest88887	you might have added a slow mirror it normally takes just a couple seconds to run an update
2009-12-31T06:08:00.000Z	ctmjr	Guest88887	no let it finish
2009-12-31T06:12:00.000Z	ctmjr	Guest88887	you do seem to be new to ubuntu/linux which is fine but may i ask why do you want aircrack it is not an easy thing to configure for a person new to linux
2009-12-31T06:15:00.000Z	ctmjr	Guest88887	ok just making sure you know what your getting into hate to have you go thru all this just to be lost trying to get aircrack working
2009-12-31T06:20:00.000Z	ctmjr	Guest88887	while your waiting it  is way to slow you can read this http://www.ubuntugeek.com/how-to-select-fastest-mirror-in-ubuntu.html
2009-12-31T07:14:00.000Z	ctmjr	Guest88887	the update has not finished yet?
2009-12-31T07:30:00.000Z	ctmjr	Guest88887	aptitude search aircrack-ng
2009-12-31T07:31:00.000Z	ctmjr	Guest88887	good now sudo aptitude install aircrack-ng
2009-12-31T07:33:00.000Z	ctmjr	Guest88887	no just try to install it and hopfully it does not take forever
2009-12-31T07:44:00.000Z	ctmjr	Guest88887	we should have changed mirrors but wanted to make sure you got your program first before you messed with it
2009-12-31T07:49:00.000Z	ctmjr	Guest88887	your welcome now change your mirrors use the guide i posted earlier
2009-12-31T08:00:00.000Z	ctmjr	Guest88887	i would try later and see if it finds one it is strange that it does not find any
