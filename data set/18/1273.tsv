2011-05-18T09:23:00.000Z	Diana		anyone had any success creating a live ubuntu usb stick that works with a Mac laptop?
2011-05-18T09:24:00.000Z	Diana		I manage to create the image in the usb disk but can't find a way for the Mac to detect the stick upon boot
2011-05-18T09:25:00.000Z	Diana		can anyone help please?
2011-05-18T09:26:00.000Z	vaxinated	Diana	Does your MAC know how to boot a USB stick?
2011-05-18T09:27:00.000Z	vaxinated	Diana	Try powering off your MAC, stick in the USB stick, then cold power on the MAC and go to the boot menu.
2011-05-18T09:28:00.000Z	vaxinated	Diana	You still cannot see the USB stick in the boot menu?
2011-05-18T09:29:00.000Z	vaxinated	Diana	is this an Intel MAC or Power MAC?
2011-05-18T09:29:00.000Z	vaxinated	Diana	you may want to check the BIOS to see if USB boot is enabled.
2011-05-18T09:30:00.000Z	vaxinated	Diana	is there any way to get to the BIOS, e.g. Press ESC or F10 or some other key on boot up?
2011-05-18T09:31:00.000Z	vaxinated	Diana	so if you wanted to change the boot order (e.g. HD, THEN CDROM), how would you do it?
2011-05-18T09:33:00.000Z	vaxinated	Diana	from my experience with intel (PC) boxes, the BIOS allows certain controls like enable/disable USB boot, change boot order, etc.  I would hope the same is available for an Intel MAC.
2011-05-18T09:35:00.000Z	vaxinated	Diana	do you see the option to boot USB device in the BOOT menu?
2011-05-18T09:36:00.000Z	vaxinated	Diana	so how could you boot a MAC stick?
2011-05-18T09:37:00.000Z	vaxinated	Diana	the boot loader has an option to pick the USB to boot from?
2011-05-18T09:41:00.000Z	vaxinated	Diana	the "Startup Manager" on your MAC does not show the USB drive as a possible boot device?
2011-05-18T09:42:00.000Z	vaxinated	Diana	what kind of MAC (model) do you have>?
