2006-07-24T09:07:00.000Z	odat	skavenge	yes
2006-07-24T09:07:00.000Z	skavenge	odat	according to the wiki instructions?
2006-07-24T09:09:00.000Z	odat	skavenge	through synaptic
2006-07-24T09:10:00.000Z	skavenge	odat	so you have the blackdown j2re packages installed?
2006-07-24T09:12:00.000Z	odat	skavenge	no not blackdown you obviously haven't been on ubuntu in a while
2006-07-24T09:13:00.000Z	skavenge	odat	well if you followed the wiki, blackdown get installed through synaptic, and java through add/remove programs, just trying to figure out which version your running since you just stated you installed through synaptic
2006-07-24T09:14:00.000Z	odat	skavenge	do you even realize that the official sun java is now in synaptic?
2006-07-24T09:15:00.000Z	skavenge	odat	obviously, you can run either, sun's version runs horribly for me
2006-07-24T09:17:00.000Z	skavenge	odat	point is i have blackdown installeed and OO isn't 'fishing' for java anywhere, you must not have the path set for the sun version or something
