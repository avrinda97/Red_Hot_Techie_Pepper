2009-11-27T09:33:00.000Z	acovrig		ssh not working
2009-11-27T09:33:00.000Z	acovrig		ssh only local
2009-11-27T09:33:00.000Z	acovrig		help?
2009-11-27T09:33:00.000Z	W9ZEB	acovrig	you've installed the openssh client/server?
2009-11-27T09:59:00.000Z	W9ZEB	acovrig	in /etc/ssh/sshd_config which interface is the daemon bound to?
2009-11-27T09:59:00.000Z	W9ZEB	acovrig	:22  or localhost:22
2009-11-27T10:00:00.000Z	acovrig	W9ZEB	would `netstat -lt | grep ssh` tell you?
2009-11-27T10:00:00.000Z	W9ZEB	acovrig	installing openssh-server now
2009-11-27T10:02:00.000Z	W9ZEB	acovrig	one moment please.
2009-11-27T10:18:00.000Z	acovrig	W9ZEB	did you answer my question while I was rebooting, or are you still working on it?
2009-11-27T10:19:00.000Z	W9ZEB	acovrig	I didn't
2009-11-27T10:19:00.000Z	W9ZEB	acovrig	you're still unable to ssh user@ip address from another machine?
2009-11-27T10:22:00.000Z	acovrig	W9ZEB	Operation timed out, I can (ssh user@localhost just fine)
2009-11-27T10:22:00.000Z	W9ZEB	acovrig	I assume you didn't edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config at all?
2009-11-27T10:23:00.000Z	W9ZEB	acovrig	hmmm.
2009-11-27T10:24:00.000Z	W9ZEB	acovrig	that's strage.  you've got no firewall running, and you've got ssh listening on 0.0.0.0:12
2009-11-27T10:26:00.000Z	W9ZEB	acovrig	I'm at a bit of a loss regarding your ssh problem.  that one's got me stumped.
2009-11-27T10:26:00.000Z	W9ZEB	acovrig	I'm not going to insult you by asking if you're sure you've got the right address :)
