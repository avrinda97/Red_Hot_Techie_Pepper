2009-12-01T21:07:00.000Z	jrib	donita	do you care about not using proprietary, closed source software?
2009-12-01T21:08:00.000Z	donita	jrib	what do you mean?
2009-12-01T21:08:00.000Z	donita	jrib	what do you mean? What if I choose proprietary, what will happen?
2009-12-01T21:08:00.000Z	jrib	donita	adobe's flash player is proprietary and closed source.  That means only adobe can develop it and fix bugs
2009-12-01T21:09:00.000Z	jrib	donita	no, I'd suggest you choose 1) unless you care about that
2009-12-01T21:10:00.000Z	jrib	donita	2) and 3) won't be able to play all flash as well as 1) does, but 2) and 3) are free software in the sense that anyone can grab the source and edit it.  That's why they exist
2009-12-01T21:13:00.000Z	jrib	donita	most support channels (including this one) prefer that you discuss only support issues
