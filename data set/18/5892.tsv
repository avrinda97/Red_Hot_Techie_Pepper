2008-08-25T22:28:00.000Z	Marcin26P	ikonia	haw to check ?
2008-08-25T22:28:00.000Z	ikonia	Marcin26P	lsmod
2008-08-25T22:29:00.000Z	ikonia	Marcin26P	no, you should just have "nvidia" as a module
2008-08-25T22:29:00.000Z	ikonia	Marcin26P	sudo modprobe nvidia
2008-08-25T22:30:00.000Z	ikonia	Marcin26P	good
2008-08-25T22:30:00.000Z	ikonia	Marcin26P	so the module is loaded
2008-08-25T22:31:00.000Z	Marcin26P	ikonia	i did instaled drivers from nvidia site it hmm lets say worked
2008-08-25T22:31:00.000Z	ikonia	Marcin26P	there is no need to install drivers from nvidia.com
2008-08-25T22:32:00.000Z	Marcin26P	ikonia	when i start drivers from system administration i dodnt have 3d acc and could use opengl full scren in mplayer
2008-08-25T22:32:00.000Z	ikonia	Marcin26P	that was potentially fixable until you installed from nvidia.com
2008-08-25T22:33:00.000Z	ikonia	Marcin26P	remove the drivers from nvidia.com, or ask for support from #nvidia
2008-08-25T23:49:00.000Z	Marcin26P	ikonia	can you help me ;)
