2006-01-15T10:10:00.000Z	necron	robotgeek	can i got next?
2006-01-15T10:10:00.000Z	robotgeek	necron	sure :)
2006-01-15T10:11:00.000Z	necron	robotgeek	heh, thanks - trying to get sbootmgr onto a cd so i can start my install
2006-01-15T10:11:00.000Z	robotgeek	necron	sbootmgr?
2006-01-15T10:12:00.000Z	necron	robotgeek	smart boot manager, if you have a way to get the cd going without a bootable cd drive i'd welcome suggestions
2006-01-15T10:12:00.000Z	necron	robotgeek	the cd is bootable, just not from the ubuntu cd
2006-01-15T10:13:00.000Z	robotgeek	necron	bootable cdrom or *cd*. AFAIK, there's nothing like a bootable cdrom
2006-01-15T10:13:00.000Z	necron	robotgeek	sorry, my cd drive is bootable, but i can't boot the ubuntu cd with it (nor can i boot an XP cd) I can boot SuSE 9.1
2006-01-15T10:14:00.000Z	robotgeek	necron	did you burn the cd yourself??
2006-01-15T10:15:00.000Z	robotgeek	necron	interesting, so it doesn't work on the PC you are trying to installing?
2006-01-15T10:15:00.000Z	necron	robotgeek	correct, i've been trying to make a bootdisk that lets me use the cd drive, but can't get it to boot (sbootmgr.dsk to a floppy using rawrite)
2006-01-15T10:17:00.000Z	robotgeek	necron	so, you are trying to make a boot flopppy
2006-01-15T10:17:00.000Z	necron	robotgeek	only because i saw it as my only alternative to trying to get a cd to boot... i think i can boot off the network card too but i've never attepted it
2006-01-15T10:18:00.000Z	necron	robotgeek	i'm just trying to install, if you have other options to what i'm doing i'm open to suggestion
2006-01-15T10:18:00.000Z	robotgeek	necron	www.etherboot.org, i think
2006-01-15T10:19:00.000Z	necron	robotgeek	right on, i'll give that a whirl... thanks for the help
2006-01-15T10:19:00.000Z	robotgeek	necron	try the netinstall, i guess. i havent managedto get it install that way when i tried 6 months ago
2006-01-15T10:19:00.000Z	robotgeek	necron	no problem, keep me updated
