2009-11-17T09:37:00.000Z	zilla1		I know this has been asked a million times, but I've got 450GB on this drive to play around with, and I want a sensible partition scheme that'll allow me to maximum flexibility.
2009-11-17T09:37:00.000Z	zilla1		thoughts?
2009-11-17T09:37:00.000Z	inveratulo	zilla1	what do you plan to do with the space?
2009-11-17T09:38:00.000Z	zilla1		store a metric butt-ton of legally obtained movies, music and tv shows. might end up installing apache and hosting a website
2009-11-17T09:39:00.000Z	inveratulo	zilla1	I would just create one huge partition for everything.  This, of course, assuming your OS drive is already taken care of; You could in theory mess around with LVMs, but since its one physical drive LVM would not convey any benefit
2009-11-17T09:50:00.000Z	zilla1	inveratulo	last time i made it one giant partition, and I wanted to upgrade my OS, I couldn't do that without saving and reinstalling everything, because my /home was in the same partition as root
2009-11-17T09:50:00.000Z	zilla1	inveratulo	i'd been told that /home /var and i think /usr should be in separate partitions if you have the room
2009-11-17T09:50:00.000Z	zilla1		and veracity to that recollection? would it do anything for me
2009-11-17T09:52:00.000Z	inveratulo	zilla1	ahhh so you want to put the os on the same disk?  hmm.
2009-11-17T09:55:00.000Z	zilla1	inveratulo	i had assumed that was standard procedure. Is it "bad form" to put the OS on the same disk?
2009-11-17T09:55:00.000Z	zilla1		that's how the standard installs come. actually, i'm not even sure how to set it up otherwise
2009-11-17T09:57:00.000Z	inveratulo	zilla1	I think your'e okay doing that.
2009-11-17T09:59:00.000Z	zilla1		so you still say leave it as one big partition? How about this inveratulo, if I *was* gonna break out specific first level directories, what ought they be? and any hints on relative sizes?
2009-11-17T09:59:00.000Z	inveratulo	zilla1	for servers i like to start out with /root, /boot, and a swap partition.  10gb for each
2009-11-17T10:00:00.000Z	inveratulo		/home, /var, /opt are also worth looking into, depending on the application
2009-11-17T10:00:00.000Z	inveratulo		villa1, sorry 10gb for /root not for the other two
2009-11-17T10:01:00.000Z	zilla1		alright, thanks so much man
2009-11-17T10:01:00.000Z	inveratulo	zilla1	i think the idea is to keep them small and don't part them out until it becomes neccessary, but then again if disk is not an issue just go crazy
