2010-01-29T06:05:00.000Z	Redache	kellopes	Gparted will do it for you, have you got any data on the disk?
2010-01-29T06:05:00.000Z	kellopes	Redache	yes i have data on the disk.. and i started to run Gparted but i was afraid to screw uup and delete everything
2010-01-29T06:06:00.000Z	kellopes	Redache	can you just follow with me so i dont mess up?
2010-01-29T06:07:00.000Z	Redache	kellopes	There should be an option in gparted to resize a partition, it will check what data is there and it'll move it into the resized partition
2010-01-29T06:08:00.000Z	Redache	kellopes	if you go to the partition drop down menu in gparted, there should be a resize/move option, use this and it should be safe
2010-01-29T06:08:00.000Z	kellopes	Redache	in the partition menu they are all disabled to use
2010-01-29T06:09:00.000Z	kellopes	Redache	i think so..
2010-01-29T06:09:00.000Z	kellopes	Redache	is the one i am using now
2010-01-29T06:09:00.000Z	Redache	kellopes	http://gparted.sourceforge.net/livecd.php You'll need this
2010-01-29T06:10:00.000Z	Redache	kellopes	I recommend backing up your data just to be safe
2010-01-29T06:10:00.000Z	kellopes	Redache	ok.. i will read it.. thanks for helping..
2010-01-29T06:10:00.000Z	Redache	kellopes	If you're important data is less than 2GB then I recommend using Ubuntu One to store it for you
2010-01-29T06:10:00.000Z	kellopes	Redache	it is already backed up.. i just want to bring it back.. but i dont want to put with the sistem partition
2010-01-29T06:12:00.000Z	Redache	kellopes	Then the gparted live CD will do what you want, just remember to leave a few GB extra on the Ubuntu partition to make sure it has room to grow
2010-01-29T06:13:00.000Z	kellopes	Redache	i will.. thakns for helping
