2011-10-09T06:28:00.000Z	zenker		in fact, i probably wont even keep windows on the hd ;)
2011-10-09T06:29:00.000Z	zenker		john havent heard of a battery issue, whats it doing?
2011-10-09T06:29:00.000Z	john	zenker	basically wahts happening is my battery is dying so fast
2011-10-09T06:29:00.000Z	john		like incredibly fast
2011-10-09T06:29:00.000Z	john		is there no work around?
2011-10-09T06:30:00.000Z	zenker	john	it may be the battery, as they die they hold less and less charge, sometimes the power manager will pick this up and display a popup (not sure if its from gnome, i use glx-dock
2011-10-09T06:31:00.000Z	john		i wouldnt mind swapping the kernal
2011-10-09T06:31:00.000Z	john		if i knew how to do that
2011-10-09T06:31:00.000Z	zenker	john	another battery killer is overheating, if its running hot and the fan is always on.... try getting a can of air and blowing everything real good
2011-10-09T06:31:00.000Z	john		the fan issue is fine, everything is real good
2011-10-09T06:31:00.000Z	john		but
2011-10-09T06:32:00.000Z	john		i just notticed like the battery would die like, 1% atleast every 49 seconds
2011-10-09T06:32:00.000Z	zenker		john also use a cool pad that can connect to a diff power supply, i use a biliken usb hub, but then again i dont take my lappie to very many places
2011-10-09T06:33:00.000Z	zenker		john last bit of advice, i do believe theres a way to check the battery, its a program but its been a looong time since ive used it
2011-10-09T06:34:00.000Z	john		ive changed it to on demand
2011-10-09T06:35:00.000Z	zenker	john	is the battery less than a year old? if so it may be covered via warranty
