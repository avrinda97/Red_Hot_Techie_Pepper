2005-10-13T14:59:00.000Z	IRCMonkey		if i choose " do nothing" to the larger partition, will it really not format it? (stupid question)
2005-10-13T15:00:00.000Z	hajiki	IRCMonkey	right
2005-10-13T15:01:00.000Z	hajiki	IRCMonkey	it will only format the partitions with the faces
2005-10-13T15:01:00.000Z	IRCMonkey	hajiki	- faces?
2005-10-13T15:02:00.000Z	hajiki	IRCMonkey	theres like some little faces next to them on the next screen
2005-10-13T15:02:00.000Z	hajiki	IRCMonkey	but in any case it should only format if you tell it to Format
2005-10-13T15:04:00.000Z	hajiki	IRCMonkey	did you chose the USE ENTIRE DISK option?
2005-10-13T15:05:00.000Z	hajiki	IRCMonkey	it meant only the ones you chose to be formatted then
2005-10-13T15:07:00.000Z	hajiki	IRCMonkey	its really up to you, do you want a really simple setup or a complex one?
2005-10-13T15:08:00.000Z	hajiki	IRCMonkey	how much RAM do you have
2005-10-13T15:08:00.000Z	hajiki	IRCMonkey	ok then i would go with a swap partion of the same size or if you think youll use a lot double it
2005-10-13T15:08:00.000Z	hajiki	IRCMonkey	and then use all the remaining space for /
2005-10-13T15:09:00.000Z	hajiki	IRCMonkey	yeah you can
2005-10-13T15:10:00.000Z	hajiki	IRCMonkey	the install should auto detect that partition if you dont delete it and add it to the boot loader
2005-10-13T15:10:00.000Z	hajiki	IRCMonkey	do you not already have a windows install?
2005-10-13T15:10:00.000Z	hajiki	IRCMonkey	windows is a bit picky so it has to be the 1st partition, so yes 3 partions if you are going to have windows
2005-10-13T15:11:00.000Z	hajiki	IRCMonkey	okay sorry i missed the fact that you had two disks :)
2005-10-13T15:16:00.000Z	hajiki	IRCMonkey	swap is what Windows considers virtual memory. its its own partition that is used when your ram is all being used up.
