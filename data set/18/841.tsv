2011-08-14T04:12:00.000Z	edbian	munzxttt	Do you have more than one terminal open?
2011-08-14T04:12:00.000Z	edbian	munzxttt	each one is a user
2011-08-14T04:15:00.000Z	munzxttt	edbian	: sorry! :) u r right ... i had two terminal open ... but i still have 2 users ... is it like me (user) and root?!!
2011-08-14T04:16:00.000Z	edbian	munzxttt	Probably because sudo hasn't worn off yet.
2011-08-14T04:16:00.000Z	munzxttt	edbian	: sorry! i am new to linux! ... what did u mean by "not worn yet"?
2011-08-14T04:17:00.000Z	edbian	munzxttt	When you do 'sudo something' then it caches your password.  For about 15 minutes.  If you sudo again for 15 minutes you will not be asked your password.  I think this is causing root to show up.
2011-08-14T04:17:00.000Z	edbian	munzxttt	make sense?
2011-08-14T04:19:00.000Z	munzxttt	edbian	: i ran "sudo su" but still!!! ... is it normal!!
2011-08-14T04:19:00.000Z	edbian	munzxttt	what?  sudo su would log you in as root
2011-08-14T04:20:00.000Z	munzxttt	edbian	: yea! i thought if i log in as root it will show only 1 user!
2011-08-14T04:21:00.000Z	edbian	munzxttt	It would show root...  It will show at least two users if you're using a GUI one for the gui and one for the bash shell you're using to run who or uptime or whatever
2011-08-14T04:22:00.000Z	munzxttt	edbian	: malamber : thanks ! :) i think i got it now! :) cheers!
2011-08-14T04:22:00.000Z	edbian	munzxttt	sure
2011-08-14T04:23:00.000Z	munzxttt	edbian	: what i got "it's ok" ... that's enough for me! :) lolz thanks again!
2011-08-14T04:23:00.000Z	edbian	munzxttt	sure :)
