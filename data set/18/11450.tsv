2006-07-26T06:46:00.000Z	WiseOdd		Being a newb, i cant figure out how to format my new disc, after i used mkfs to make a new partition... what do I do now? sb help!
2006-07-26T06:47:00.000Z	DanieC	WiseOdd	I am used to use fdisk
2006-07-26T06:50:00.000Z	DanieC	WiseOdd	firstly use fdisk, then mkfs
2006-07-26T06:51:00.000Z	DanieC	WiseOdd	fdisk- partition, mkfs- format llike DOS.
2006-07-26T06:52:00.000Z	WiseOdd	DanieC	when i used mkfs it created a new partition for me.. isnt that what fdsik is supposed to do? fdisk in "win Language" creates partition... (as you probably know :))
2006-07-26T06:53:00.000Z	DanieC	WiseOdd	if you like GUI, you can use Disk Manager.
2006-07-26T06:54:00.000Z	WiseOdd	DanieC	disk manager won't let me format the disc? does it have anything to do with the disc being external usb disc?
2006-07-26T06:55:00.000Z	DanieC	WiseOdd	What kind of disc are you gonna to format?
2006-07-26T06:56:00.000Z	WiseOdd	DanieC	exf2, but only bcause that apparently is the standard linux mode... My main problem is that my disc all are in read only modes...
2006-07-26T06:58:00.000Z	DanieC	WiseOdd	read-only maybe caused by your usb switch
2006-07-26T06:59:00.000Z	WiseOdd	DanieC	my internal disks are also read only, and when i tried what the online faq says, it didnt work at all :(
2006-07-26T07:00:00.000Z	WiseOdd	DanieC	but now disk manager says there are no rekogniced partitions on the usb disc...
2006-07-26T07:00:00.000Z	DanieC	WiseOdd	post your log here
2006-07-26T07:01:00.000Z	WiseOdd	DanieC	what log?
2006-07-26T07:01:00.000Z	DanieC	WiseOdd	err log
2006-07-26T07:03:00.000Z	DanieC	WiseOdd	if you want your ntfs writable, please try FUSE
2006-07-26T07:03:00.000Z	WiseOdd	DanieC	i havent a clue which err log you are talking about... remember im a newb, real bad!
