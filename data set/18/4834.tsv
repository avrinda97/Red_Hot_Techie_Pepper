2009-02-14T01:37:00.000Z	SeanTater		I have a program with a file opened which ceased to exist because a device was unplugged. SIGKILL has no effect, it has status "running" and uses 100% sys. Can it be killed?
2009-02-14T01:38:00.000Z	yownanymous	SeanTater	You can kill anything
2009-02-14T01:39:00.000Z	SeanTater	yownanymous	but kill -9 and killall -KILL have no effect...
2009-02-14T01:39:00.000Z	yownanymous	SeanTater	What's the program/process called?
2009-02-14T01:39:00.000Z	SeanTater	yownanymous	mogrify (from imagemagick)
2009-02-14T01:40:00.000Z	yownanymous	SeanTater	sudo kill mogrify
2009-02-14T01:40:00.000Z	SeanTater	yownanymous	still no effect
2009-02-14T01:40:00.000Z	yownanymous	SeanTater	What did you remove?
2009-02-14T01:41:00.000Z	SeanTater	yownanymous	An SD card
2009-02-14T01:41:00.000Z	yownanymous	SeanTater	Reinsert the SD card?
2009-02-14T01:42:00.000Z	SeanTater	yownanymous	The file it was reading has since been deleted using another computer.. would it still have any effect?
2009-02-14T01:42:00.000Z	yownanymous	SeanTater	Why don't you restart your system?
2009-02-14T01:43:00.000Z	SeanTater	yownanymous	Well I didn't notice it for about a week and I have two cores so it's not detrimental and it's inetresting..
2009-02-14T01:44:00.000Z	SeanTater	yownanymous	/interesting/ I mean
2009-02-14T01:44:00.000Z	yownanymous	SeanTater	Got no idea what to do...
2009-02-14T01:44:00.000Z	SeanTater	yownanymous	That's fine. Is it worth a bug report?
2009-02-14T01:45:00.000Z	yownanymous	SeanTater	very probably, you could have an issue here
2009-02-14T01:45:00.000Z	SeanTater	yownanymous	Thanks!
