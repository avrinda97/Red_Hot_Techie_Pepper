2005-03-07T07:35:00.000Z	jacquesmerde		da_bon_bon...in what way is your cron idea better?
2005-03-07T07:36:00.000Z	jacquesmerde		is update manager merely performing apt-get update's?
2005-03-07T07:36:00.000Z	jacquesmerde		is update manager merely performing apt-get upgrades
2005-03-07T07:37:00.000Z	jacquesmerde		then it would miss the upgrading i need which i can only get by constant dist-upgrading...
2005-03-07T07:39:00.000Z	jacquesmerde		da_bon_bon...then update-manager is all i need to stay completely up to date? and any other way is just beyond me?
2005-03-07T07:41:00.000Z	jacquesmerde		with update and dist-upgrade, no upgrades. and with the -y and --forces-yes switches?
2005-03-07T07:43:00.000Z	jacquesmerde		i'm not trying to be risky, i just get very confused about what the normal,official,  unrisky, ungeeky, newbie way of keeping ubuntu up to date is...
2005-03-07T07:45:00.000Z	jacquesmerde		so tritium, running update-manager AND dist-upgrade regularly is dangerous?
2005-03-07T07:47:00.000Z	jacquesmerde		but doing constant upgrades isnt dangerous?
2005-03-07T07:47:00.000Z	jacquesmerde		unless i ever plan to do a dist-upgrade of course....so as soon as you install your system you have to decide between keeping it up to date with upgrades or dist-upgrades...
2005-03-07T07:48:00.000Z	LinuxJones	jacquesmerde	you only dist-upgrade when you move from one branch to the other like warty to hoary. you don't use it all the time
2005-03-07T07:49:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	LinuxJones	i've just been told thats a myth
2005-03-07T07:49:00.000Z	LinuxJones	jacquesmerde	if it were a myth there would be no apt-get (update)
2005-03-07T07:51:00.000Z	LinuxJones	jacquesmerde	well according to what you've said you were told that you should only use dist-upgrade
