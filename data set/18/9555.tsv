2007-03-22T06:01:00.000Z	manton2007		All kidding aside, isn't there a way to get a higher screen resolution than 1024 by ...
2007-03-22T06:01:00.000Z	Madpilot	manton2007	yes, there is
2007-03-22T06:13:00.000Z	Madpilot	manton2007	either System->Prefs->Screen Resolution, or open a terminal via Applications->Accessories->Terminal to follow the !fixres tutorial
2007-03-22T06:13:00.000Z	manton2007	Madpilot	currently I'm running on live Cd. Will it work?
2007-03-22T06:14:00.000Z	Madpilot	manton2007	yes, but you'll have to redo it every time you reboot the LiveCD - none of your settings will be saved
2007-03-22T06:21:00.000Z	Madpilot	manton2007	you're probably going to have to manually edit xorg, like the !fixres URLs say
2007-03-22T06:22:00.000Z	manton2007	Madpilot	I'm not sure how to go about that.
2007-03-22T06:22:00.000Z	Madpilot	manton2007	read through http://help.ubuntu.com/community/FixVideoResolutionHowto
2007-03-22T06:23:00.000Z	manton2007	Madpilot	I will. Thanks
2007-03-22T06:29:00.000Z	manton2007	Madpilot	I appreciate your help. So far, the info I'm reading is beyond me. I've got an nvidia card. Can you lead me through it?
2007-03-22T06:30:00.000Z	Madpilot	manton2007	hmm, I've got an AIT card, and it's always found the right res (1280x1024x75) on it's own. Ask specific questions about the parts of that page that're confusing, though, and either I or someone else in here will help!
2007-03-22T06:31:00.000Z	manton2007	Madpilot	I typed in the code to recognize my video car. But it didn't seem to work. The resolution options don't change. I've used the KDE interface on this machine before, so I know the screen can do better than this.
2007-03-22T06:33:00.000Z	Madpilot	manton2007	which part of that fixres page are you on?
2007-03-22T06:34:00.000Z	Madpilot	manton2007	start with "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" - that'll walk you thru a bunch of config questions
2007-03-22T06:36:00.000Z	manton2007	Madpilot	once it says it recongnized my car, what do I do?
2007-03-22T06:37:00.000Z	Madpilot	manton2007	restart X - Ctrl+Alt+Backspace will restart X (and all your apps)
2007-03-22T06:44:00.000Z	Madpilot	manton2007	check the actual hardware of your screen - the width/height/contrast/brightness setting - wide black margins could be some width/height of display setting there
2007-03-22T06:46:00.000Z	manton2007	Madpilot	it works fine with the old windows the way it's set. I wish I could change it the other way, with a high screen resolution.
