2008-03-31T06:36:00.000Z	aaron_		am I still muted?
2008-03-31T06:37:00.000Z	LjL	aaron_	no
2008-10-16T01:10:00.000Z	LjL	aaron_	it's possible but not supported, it's difficult, and risks breaking stuff possibly badly. why do you need to?
2008-10-16T01:15:00.000Z	LjL	aaron_	no, it isn't.
2008-10-16T01:15:00.000Z	LjL	aaron_	if you have the updates repositories enabled (like you should), you should get an automatic notification of the available upgrade.
2008-10-16T01:17:00.000Z	LjL	aaron_	pastebin your /etc/apt/sources.list please
2008-10-16T01:19:00.000Z	LjL	aaron_	copy, paste, and give me the resulting url
2008-10-16T01:23:00.000Z	LjL	aaron_	you have the repositories correctly enabled. try typing "sudo apt-get update" and see if the update appears - otherwise, it might just be that your mirrors weren't yet updated. this kernel update was out just today.
2008-10-16T01:25:00.000Z	LjL	aaron_	if you installed its driver via unsupported means, then maybe. if you just used the restricted drivers manager, it shouldn't.
