2007-04-24T15:33:00.000Z	dooglus		I click 'enable desktop effects' and it tells me 'desktop effects could not be enabled'.  where can I find more information?  I don't see any 'details' button.
2007-04-24T15:33:00.000Z	deCon	dooglus	check if your video card is compatible with the features desktop effects gives
2007-04-24T15:34:00.000Z	dooglus	deCon	it is.
2007-04-24T15:34:00.000Z	dooglus	deCon	I've used it with beryl in dapper and sid
2007-04-24T15:34:00.000Z	deCon	dooglus	maybe it is a bug, it does that for me too. but i just use beryl instead
2007-04-26T05:06:00.000Z	dooglus	deCon	I just tried using the feisty live CD on a different PC
2007-04-26T05:06:00.000Z	deCon	dooglus	to do what again?
2007-04-26T05:07:00.000Z	dooglus	deCon	I'm trying to use a live CD, but it just won't keep anything I do.
2007-04-26T05:08:00.000Z	deCon	dooglus	keep? as in save??? ...settings and config?
2007-04-26T05:11:00.000Z	dooglus	deCon	as in anything, yes.  like the graphic card drivers, for example.
2007-04-26T05:12:00.000Z	dooglus	deCon	the dapper liveCD would read and write settings to my memory stick
2007-04-26T05:12:00.000Z	deCon	dooglus	it is because it is a trial, you have not set up a drive to actually save these things. The live cd will run it, but until you point the OS to a place to save things (this doesn't count in the live cd)...it needs a ext2 or ext3 filesystem to save to, which you haven't set up
2007-04-26T05:13:00.000Z	dooglus	deCon	is some extra set up needed?  I set it up for dapper already.
2007-04-26T05:13:00.000Z	deCon	dooglus	but your running the live cd, right? if its on your memory stick..hmm...it isn't saving things to it now?
2007-04-26T05:14:00.000Z	dooglus	deCon	dapper saves everything you do to the 'casper-rw' partition of the memory stick, if one exists.  I can't get feisty to do the same.  I'm talking about the live CD, yes.
2007-04-26T05:14:00.000Z	deCon	dooglus	interesting, i have no idea. give a shout and see if someone else would know why
2007-04-26T05:15:00.000Z	dooglus	deCon	it's a useful thing to have - it means I can take my ubuntu install from pc to pc - I use quite a lot of different (windows) machines, you see
2007-04-26T05:16:00.000Z	deCon	dooglus	i dont know how pen drives operate with the live cd, it isn't something i've had to learn yet...good luck.
