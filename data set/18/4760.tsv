2009-02-14T19:43:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Elive_user77_en	You start Ubuntu from the initial GRUB menu?
2009-02-14T19:44:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Elive_user77_en	On that menu, there should be a "Recovery" option too... have you tried that?
2009-02-14T19:45:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Elive_user77_en	If you boot to the recovery console you'll also see all the kernel boot messages that the usual Ubuntu splash screen hides from you. That might help you see an error report

2009-02-14T20:02:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Elive_user77_en	OK, the 'busybox' is a limited shell that is launched when the kernel can't find the root device, usually because something has been changed on the disk.
2009-02-14T20:03:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Elive_user77_en	It is possible the Elive installation has changed/over-written part of the Ubuntu installation
2009-02-14T20:05:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	Elive_user77_en	The possibilities are almost endless - it's not something I'd want to try to sort out remotely.
