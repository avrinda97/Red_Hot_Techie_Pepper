2006-11-25T12:49:00.000Z	DrakeMastil		Cedega is all i know... are there others? preferably free
2006-11-25T12:49:00.000Z	DARKGuy	DrakeMastil	WINE is one, but it needs some tweaking for a few games
2006-11-25T12:49:00.000Z	DARKGuy	DrakeMastil	there are also Loki installers for Windows games that you already have
2006-11-25T12:50:00.000Z	DrakeMastil	DARKGuy	Tweaking as in? I'm an power-user, in terms, on windows but still newer to linux
2006-11-25T12:51:00.000Z	DARKGuy	DrakeMastil	same here ;) some games (like World of Warcraft, for example) need specifical patches needed to be inserted in a WINE source package and recompile WINE entirely, so WoW works
2006-11-25T12:51:00.000Z	DARKGuy	DrakeMastil	other games may just work without any problems (Like Diablo II) and others might need some WINE config tweaking, rather than in Cedega just installing and running :P
2006-11-25T12:51:00.000Z	DrakeMastil	DARKGuy	How about Lineage 2?
2006-11-25T12:52:00.000Z	DARKGuy	DrakeMastil	Hm, I've only played it in Windows, but I'm not really sure it'll work... not the game, but the anti hacking system itself (which is similar to the ones that GunBound, Silkroad and Mu use) might not let you run it... who knows, you could give it a go
2006-11-25T12:53:00.000Z	DARKGuy	DrakeMastil	Lineage 2 uses a modified Unreal Engine so for that I'm sure it works, but the antihacking system might be a problem since it uses Windows specific API for getting PC info, opened processes and such ^^;
2006-11-25T12:54:00.000Z	DrakeMastil	DARKGuy	sounds good thus far... just need to learn the commands for BASH now xD
2006-11-25T12:55:00.000Z	DARKGuy	DrakeMastil	those won't be a problem ^_^ try to handle yourself in the Linux environment and familiarize yourself with it, you're going to have to use the terminal a lot so a tutorial like dabaR just linked you might help :)
2006-11-25T12:56:00.000Z	DrakeMastil	DARKGuy	Any idea how to get WINE downloaded the links are not very let's say user friendly
2006-11-25T12:59:00.000Z	DARKGuy	DrakeMastil	Hm, in the Wine page there's a HowTo for downloading it, you just have to add the repository to your sources.list and do apt-get update, then apt-get install wine :P
2006-11-25T12:59:00.000Z	DARKGuy	DrakeMastil	However if you're on 64-bit as you mentioned... yeah, gotta recompile from source, and I'm afraid I've never done that :(
2006-11-25T13:00:00.000Z	DARKGuy	DrakeMastil	but the source can be obtained from the same repository if I recall correctly :P
