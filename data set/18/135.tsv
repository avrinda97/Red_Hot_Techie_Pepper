2012-08-17T01:04:00.000Z	MichelFP	bekks	i can dual boot
2012-08-17T01:02:00.000Z	bekks	MichelFP	Which hardware raid controller is it?
2012-08-17T01:03:00.000Z	MichelFP	bekks	i don't really know
2012-08-17T01:04:00.000Z	bekks	MichelFP	You'd know when you'd have hardware raid controller. Most likely it is a software raid controller, and in that case, you simply cant setup a dualboot which actually works, since the "raid" is only visible from within windows.
2012-08-17T01:05:00.000Z	bekks	MichelFP	But you cant use that "raid" from within Ubuntu.
2012-08-17T01:05:00.000Z	bekks	MichelFP	Forget about windows driven software raid, and re-setup your box.
2012-08-17T01:06:00.000Z	MichelFP	bekks	box? >_>
2012-08-17T01:06:00.000Z	bekks	MichelFP	"computer".
2012-08-17T01:07:00.000Z	bekks	MichelFP	Reinstall, without any form of software raid.
2012-08-17T01:08:00.000Z	bekks	MichelFP	Thats a RAID0, not a RAID1, as you assumed earlier.
2012-08-17T01:08:00.000Z	bekks	MichelFP	And a windows driven raid0 is totally unusable in linux.
2012-08-17T01:09:00.000Z	bekks	MichelFP	No.
2012-08-17T01:09:00.000Z	bekks	MichelFP	I gave you a pretty precise answer :)
2012-08-17T01:12:00.000Z	MichelFP	bekks	if this is any relevant, look at this: https://dl.dropbox.com/u/59319743/Capturar.PNG
2012-08-17T01:13:00.000Z	MichelFP	bekks	did you see that?
2012-08-17T01:13:00.000Z	bekks	MichelFP	Then provide the output of sudo fdisk -l from linux
2012-08-17T01:14:00.000Z	MichelFP	bekks	ok
2012-08-17T01:14:00.000Z	MichelFP	bekks	i'll be right back
