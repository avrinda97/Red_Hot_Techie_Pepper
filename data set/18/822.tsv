2011-09-24T01:34:00.000Z	rhin0		anyone know what to do to get ubuntu 10.10 to install on a dell inspiron m5010 -- there is an obvious problem (something to do with "acpi = off"?) ...
2011-09-24T01:35:00.000Z	alkafoo	rhin0	what's the problem?
2011-09-24T01:36:00.000Z	alkafoo	rhin0	what does it do?
2011-09-24T01:36:00.000Z	alkafoo	rhin0	can you hear the install disc spinning
2011-09-24T01:37:00.000Z	alkafoo	rhin0	does it keep spinning?
2011-09-24T01:38:00.000Z	alkafoo	rhin0	check the BIOS, see if there are any SATA compatibility modes you can toggle
2011-09-24T01:39:00.000Z	alkafoo	rhin0	I've had a problem before where the CD drive wouldn't spin because of a BIOS option yes
2011-09-24T01:39:00.000Z	alkafoo	rhin0	if it turns out that's what it is, and if you'r dual booting Windows, remember to toggle it back before booting Windows
2011-09-24T01:40:00.000Z	rhin0	alkafoo	- how can I get kernel boot parameters when it doesn't even let me in
2011-09-24T01:40:00.000Z	alkafoo	rhin0	you'd need the GRUB menu screen
2011-09-24T01:41:00.000Z	alkafoo	rhin0	not even when holding SHIFT during bootup?
2011-09-24T01:42:00.000Z	alkafoo	rhin0	you're just trying to install Ubuntu, right?  For a dual boot or just Ubuntu alone?
2011-09-24T01:50:00.000Z	rhin0	alkafoo	got it going pci=noacpi -- whats that?  (pls)
2011-09-24T01:52:00.000Z	alkafoo	rhin0	voodoo

2011-09-27T01:18:00.000Z	alkafoo	rhin0	there's a pref for just seeing or actually being able to do stuff, too, IIRC
2011-09-27T01:21:00.000Z	alkafoo	rhin0	well you _could_ probably do it from SSH but =P
2011-09-27T01:36:00.000Z	rhin0	alkafoo	I think it's because of compiz on the server machine (vinagre can't control)
