2008-04-11T17:46:00.000Z	joep		Hello. Does anybody know what is used in ubuntu for the command chkconfig?
2008-04-11T17:46:00.000Z	Dr_willis	joep	 Huh?
2008-04-11T17:48:00.000Z	joep	Dr_willis	The standard linux command to control the network environment.
2008-04-11T17:48:00.000Z	Dr_willis	joep	 i cant recall ever seeing that as a standard command.
2008-04-11T17:49:00.000Z	joep	Dr_willis	Look in Fedora (Redhat) and Suse to name 2.
2008-04-11T17:50:00.000Z	Dr_willis	joep	 just because they have it does not make it 'standard linux' command. They have a lot of other  customized utilities that are not in the varioys debian related disrtos.
2008-04-11T17:51:00.000Z	joep	Dr_willis	: Yes, I discover that in my process to go from FC7 to Ubuntu. Sound is completely different, the security is different and that are the things I just have found.
2008-04-11T17:51:00.000Z	Dr_willis	joep	 you missed the package management system. :)
2008-04-11T17:51:00.000Z	joep	Dr_willis	You mean synaptic?
2008-04-11T17:52:00.000Z	Dr_willis	joep	 synaptic is just a front end to the apt-get/dpkg/deb system.
2008-04-11T17:53:00.000Z	joep	Dr_willis	Ok., good to know but I am of course accustomed to RPM and dpkg is still a mystery for me.
2008-04-11T18:03:00.000Z	joep	Dr_willis	IN fedora ther is: it's called yum.
2008-04-11T18:32:00.000Z	Dr_willis	joep	  theres a free book on ubuntu - google for ubuntu training wiki.
2008-04-11T18:32:00.000Z	Dr_willis	joep	 300+ pages in pdf frmat
2008-04-11T18:35:00.000Z	joep	Dr_willis	Thanks for the tip but does it register the differences with e.g. Fedora?? I don't want to read 300+ pages of which I know most part. Most important of course is the directory structure and the use of e.g.the messagebus by the different applications. i want the technical information.
2008-04-11T18:36:00.000Z	Dr_willis	joep	 nope. its a text book for a total beginners guide to ubuntu. book. it even has a teachers edition, and student edition.
2008-04-11T18:36:00.000Z	Dr_willis	joep	 but its free. :) so why not download it   and skimm it
2008-04-11T18:37:00.000Z	joep	Dr_willis	I will certainly do it but, although I'm  retired I'm more busy then ever!.
