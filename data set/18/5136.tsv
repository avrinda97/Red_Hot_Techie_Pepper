2009-08-06T06:25:00.000Z	mdg	meditatingfrog	what kind of dvd-R?
2009-08-06T06:25:00.000Z	meditatingfrog	mdg	pioneer dv117...I think
2009-08-06T06:25:00.000Z	meditatingfrog	mdg	pioneer dvr117...right Retro198909?
2009-08-06T06:25:00.000Z	mdg	meditatingfrog	you have medibuntu repos added?
2009-08-06T06:26:00.000Z	meditatingfrog	mdg	I'd have to check
2009-08-06T06:26:00.000Z	meditatingfrog	mdg	are they installed by default?
2009-08-06T06:26:00.000Z	mdg	meditatingfrog	no
2009-08-06T06:27:00.000Z	meditatingfrog	mdg	why?
2009-08-06T06:27:00.000Z	mdg	meditatingfrog	some countries don't allow proprietary codecs and such
2009-08-06T06:28:00.000Z	meditatingfrog	mdg	 so you're saying the pioneer dvr117 might not be working in Ubuntu because of a software issue
2009-08-06T06:29:00.000Z	mdg	meditatingfrog	I think you will have better results once you add medibuntu and update all codecs and such
2009-08-06T06:29:00.000Z	meditatingfrog	mdg	 I don't have a problem with my dvd-r(w) Retro198909 does
2009-08-06T06:29:00.000Z	mdg	meditatingfrog	burning a new distro to disk to try
2009-08-06T06:29:00.000Z	mdg	meditatingfrog	sorry!
2009-08-06T06:30:00.000Z	meditatingfrog	mdg	oh, no need to be sorry, I'm learning too :)
2009-08-06T06:30:00.000Z	meditatingfrog	mdg	 just wanted to make sure Retro198909 heard
2009-08-06T06:30:00.000Z	mdg	meditatingfrog	this is a great place to learn, for sure!
2009-08-06T06:48:00.000Z	meditatingfrog	mdg	do you install non-free in medibuntu?
