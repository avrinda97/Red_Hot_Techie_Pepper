2011-08-29T01:54:00.000Z	manbra		Hey, I'm trying to format an original xbox hard drive.  The disk utility that comes with linux is getting an error.  What other apps should I try?
2011-08-29T01:55:00.000Z	usr13	manbra	What disk utility?
2011-08-29T01:55:00.000Z	manbra		It's just called 'Disk Utility', its the default one with 11.04
2011-08-29T01:56:00.000Z	usr13	manbra	Exactly what are you trying to do?  What type of file system are you wanting to put on it?
2011-08-29T01:56:00.000Z	manbra	usr13	what ever ubuntu's default is.
2011-08-29T01:56:00.000Z	usr13	manbra	Which drive is it?  sudo fdisk -l
2011-08-29T01:57:00.000Z	manbra		Er, before I do that, how the f do I turn off the new GUI?  I'm running off a usb drive now and I don't have the option to log off and select a new one there
2011-08-29T01:57:00.000Z	manbra		I have no idea how to bring up terminal w/ the new gui
2011-08-29T01:58:00.000Z	usr13	manbra	Well it would be:   sudo  mkfs.ext4 /dev/s??#
2011-08-29T01:58:00.000Z	usr13	manbra	Alt-F2 gnome-terminal
2011-08-29T01:59:00.000Z	manbra		Thank you, usr13
2011-08-29T02:03:00.000Z	manbra	usr13	sudo fdisk -l does not show the harddrive
2011-08-29T02:03:00.000Z	manbra		But the harddrive is there in disk utility
2011-08-29T02:03:00.000Z	usr13		netmind: cd ; zip -r Some_Directory.zip Desktop/Some_Directory/
2011-08-29T02:03:00.000Z	manbra		sudo fdisk -l only shows the USB drive
2011-08-29T02:04:00.000Z	usr13		martian_: If you don't see it in the output of  sudo fdisk -l   you will not be able to format it.
2011-08-29T02:04:00.000Z	usr13	manbra	If you don't see it in the output of  sudo fdisk -l   you will not be able to format it.
2011-08-29T02:05:00.000Z	manbra	usr13	thanks for the help
