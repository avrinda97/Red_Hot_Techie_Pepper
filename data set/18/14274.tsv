2005-12-07T10:15:00.000Z	P8ntKid		How do you extract a tar.bz2 file?
2005-12-07T10:15:00.000Z	thoreauputic	P8ntKid	 tar xvjf <file>
2005-12-07T10:23:00.000Z	P8ntKid	thoreauputic	When i did that, it cluttered up my home folder with files :( how to I make it so it makes its own folder?
2005-12-07T10:23:00.000Z	thoreauputic	P8ntKid	oh, that means the guty  who made the file buggered it up
2005-12-07T10:24:00.000Z	thoreauputic	P8ntKid	best to untar in /home/you/tmp or similar
2005-12-07T10:24:00.000Z	P8ntKid	thoreauputic	How did I do that?
2005-12-07T10:25:00.000Z	thoreauputic	P8ntKid	that's really irritating when the person who makes the tarball doesn't tar the directory properly
2005-12-07T10:25:00.000Z	thoreauputic	P8ntKid	it wasn't you, unless you created the file
2005-12-07T10:25:00.000Z	P8ntKid	thoreauputic	Yep.
2005-12-07T10:25:00.000Z	P8ntKid	thoreauputic	Lol, no it wasnt me.
2005-12-07T10:26:00.000Z	thoreauputic	P8ntKid	complain to whoever made that tar.bz2 then
2005-12-07T10:26:00.000Z	thoreauputic	P8ntKid	no tarball should spray files all over your directory like that
2005-12-07T10:27:00.000Z	P8ntKid	thoreauputic	Could i do something like "tar -xvjf <filename> /home/jon/foldernamehere"?
2005-12-07T10:28:00.000Z	thoreauputic	P8ntKid	you can direct the output, yes - I forget the option - maybe -d (check the man page)
2005-12-07T10:29:00.000Z	thoreauputic	P8ntKid	i just move the tarball to /home/me/tmp before untarring (in case of these problems)
2005-12-07T10:30:00.000Z	P8ntKid	thoreauputic	Ok.
2005-12-07T10:30:00.000Z	P8ntKid	thoreauputic	Thanks.
2005-12-07T10:31:00.000Z	thoreauputic	P8ntKid	no worries :)
