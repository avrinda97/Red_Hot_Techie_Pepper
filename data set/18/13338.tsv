2005-12-05T06:59:00.000Z	Zedugh	philbilly	cd to src dir (ndiswrapper-1.5)?
2005-12-05T06:59:00.000Z	philbilly	Zedugh	done that
2005-12-05T06:59:00.000Z	Zedugh	philbilly	did you ./configure?
2005-12-05T07:00:00.000Z	philbilly	Zedugh	no -i'll try
2005-12-05T07:01:00.000Z	philbilly	Zedugh	-./configure not listed in this dir -only Makefile
2005-12-05T07:02:00.000Z	Zedugh	philbilly	look for file 'configure' not file './configure'
2005-12-05T07:02:00.000Z	Zedugh	philbilly	execute file configure by typing ./configure
2005-12-05T07:03:00.000Z	philbilly	Zedugh	none there -perhaps  I should untar src package? -how do you rmdir with files still in sub dirs?
2005-12-05T07:04:00.000Z	Zedugh	philbilly	yes, you must untar src. to delete dir and all contents 'rm -rf <dir>', be careful
2005-12-05T07:05:00.000Z	philbilly	Zedugh	there is no config so will del untarred pkg and  start afresh -tnks waring re erasing all!!!
2005-12-05T07:09:00.000Z	philbilly	Zedugh	oskude: my rmdir has no switch -r -man page doesnt refer to this also
