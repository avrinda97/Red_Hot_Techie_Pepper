2007-12-18T06:24:00.000Z	VSpike		omg open office really sucks
2007-12-18T06:25:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	VSpike	Do you have a question?  Since comments like that as not appreciated.. we didnt write OO
2007-12-18T06:26:00.000Z	VSpike	Jack_Sparrow	I did .. I was wondering if the spreadsheet alternatives like Gnumeric or KSpread were ready to be used as general alternatives to OO Calc
2007-12-18T06:26:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	VSpike	It costs nothing to try them and see if they suit your needs
2007-12-18T06:28:00.000Z	VSpike	Jack_Sparrow	I'm also wondering if OO is known for being slow and buggy and prone to freezing or doing wierd things, or it's just my setup, or perhaps my not knowing how to use it right
2007-12-18T06:28:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	VSpike	Slow is relative to your hardware and your needs..  Works fine for most people.
2007-12-18T06:29:00.000Z	VSpike	Jack_Sparrow	on a dual core x2 4000 or something like that, with 2G of RAM, was finding it taking 5 seconds to do a page up/down, and could see the toolbars redrawing themselves over the course of a few seconds with every operation
2007-12-18T06:29:00.000Z	VSpike	Jack_Sparrow	I've closed and re-opened it and it seemed to improve, but now it's hung while trying to insert a conditional sum
2007-12-18T06:29:00.000Z	VSpike	Jack_Sparrow	it also crashed the first time I tried to put a formula in
2007-12-18T06:30:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	VSpike	What drivers are you using for your video card etc...  and again, this is bordering on discussion
2007-12-18T06:30:00.000Z	VSpike	Jack_Sparrow	nvidia
2007-12-18T06:30:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	VSpike	If it crashed with your first formula then you did not get it installed correctly.. Did you get oo yourself to have the latest or install with from ubuntu livecd
2007-12-18T06:31:00.000Z	VSpike	Jack_Sparrow	it was installed in the standard way from alternative install cd.  I've used spreadsheets and formulae before and since, so it was just a one off
2007-12-18T06:32:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	VSpike	Your experience with OO is not the norm.. I use it regularly with spreadsheets that are usually 10 pages long and other than occasional formatting problems it works fine for me
2007-12-18T06:32:00.000Z	VSpike	Jack_Sparrow	very strange
2007-12-18T06:33:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	VSpike	OO has their own channel...
2007-12-18T06:33:00.000Z	VSpike	Jack_Sparrow	yes, good point
2008-12-03T19:29:00.000Z	VSpike	Jack_Sparrow	what about jigdo?
