2010-06-09T23:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Ryan_: its a bit more involved
2010-06-09T23:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Laomao: gnomedo reuires sompositing as far as I know
2010-06-09T23:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Ryan_: what command?
2010-06-09T23:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Ryan_; me typing !grub2 makes ubottu give you a link to a guide, !grub2 is NOT a command
2010-06-09T23:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Nucc1: grab the latest hplip and install it. May help

2010-06-09T23:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Rewati: could set vm.swappiness to a low value if you have more than 1Gb RAm
2010-06-09T23:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Sajro: didn't think it mattered but if you found it and its an issue then i'd go with it
2010-06-09T23:24:00.000Z	nucc1	ActionParsnip	i'm using lucid. it doesn't have the latest?
2010-06-09T23:26:00.000Z	nucc1	ActionParsnip	i'm going there now. see if it isn't too complicated to set up
2010-06-09T23:28:00.000Z	nucc1	ActionParsnip	ok.
2011-01-25T21:32:00.000Z	nucc1	ActionParsnip	the package is called 'flashplugin-installer' nowadays
2011-01-25T21:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nucc1	looks fine to me
2011-01-25T21:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nucc1	source: flashplugin-nonfree ;)
2011-01-25T21:33:00.000Z	nucc1	ActionParsnip	it's just a transitional package.
