2006-06-06T08:45:00.000Z	toxic_	Healot	k thx
2006-06-06T08:46:00.000Z	Healot	extern	you might want to prepend sudo
2006-06-06T08:50:00.000Z	toxic_	Healot	I can only see different fonts in xorg.conf, not how I can specify my keyboard layout in X.
2006-06-06T08:51:00.000Z	Healot		did you see the "us" in Keyboard section
2006-06-06T08:51:00.000Z	toxic_		How can I specify my keyboard layout in X (not font) ?
2006-06-06T08:52:00.000Z	Healot		change that to your keyboard... toxic_, anyways easier to do it with "dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg"
2006-06-06T08:52:00.000Z	Healot		or any other GUI tool
2006-06-06T08:52:00.000Z	toxic_	Healot	ok I\ll read on the documentation on that one then :)
