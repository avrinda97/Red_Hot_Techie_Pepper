2007-01-02T15:01:00.000Z	Swiftfeet8		Is anyone available to help with a Java issue in Ubuntu/Linux in general?
2007-01-02T15:02:00.000Z	xtknight	Swiftfeet8	sure, whats your question?
2007-01-02T15:03:00.000Z	Swiftfeet8	xtknight	I am trying to install an older version of java but not having luck
2007-01-02T15:04:00.000Z	xtknight	Swiftfeet8	like java 1.4x?
2007-01-02T15:04:00.000Z	Swiftfeet8	xtknight	yes 1.4.0 to be exact
2007-01-02T15:06:00.000Z	xtknight	Swiftfeet8	umm, jdk or jre?
2007-01-02T15:06:00.000Z	Swiftfeet8	xtknight	jre
2007-01-02T15:06:00.000Z	Swiftfeet8	xtknight	I just need the runtime for a browser based GUI that doesn't like newer versions of java
2007-01-02T15:08:00.000Z	Swiftfeet8	xtknight	I might have found something brb
2007-01-02T15:21:00.000Z	Swiftfeet8	xtknight	It doesn't appear that 1.4.0 is installing on my system.  I have followed the directions from Sun.  5.0 installs fine, but I can't get 1.4.0 to.
2007-01-02T15:21:00.000Z	xtknight	Swiftfeet8	what's the error and what method did you use
2007-01-02T15:22:00.000Z	Swiftfeet8	xtknight	I don't get any errors.  I am using the bin file
2007-01-02T15:22:00.000Z	xtknight	Swiftfeet8	no errors? what happens?
2007-01-02T15:24:00.000Z	Swiftfeet8	xtknight	everything installs fine but when I go to a site to see what version I am running it says the latest version.  If I remove the latest version and try using just the old version I get nothing.
2007-01-02T15:24:00.000Z	xtknight	Swiftfeet8	hmm...so you are trying to install the jre 1.4 and firefox plugin, correct?
2007-01-02T15:27:00.000Z	Swiftfeet8	xtknight	yes I am putting a soft link to the plugin in the plugins directory under mozilla
2007-01-02T15:28:00.000Z	xtknight	Swiftfeet8	sorry i dont have much experience with java, try looking at the above guide.  it mentions blackdown 1.4 java
2007-01-02T15:28:00.000Z	Swiftfeet8	xtknight	ok thanks for the help
