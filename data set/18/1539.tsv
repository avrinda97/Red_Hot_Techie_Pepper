2011-01-26T11:56:00.000Z	jhansonxi	Firmin	check the CUPS web interface.  CUPS has a web server running on your system.  Open a browser and go to "localhost:631".  Check the job status, printer settings, etc.  Also check the error log at "/var/log/cups/error_log"
2011-01-26T11:57:00.000Z	jhansonxi	Firmin	usually when a job is stuck it is because the printer is not available (bad connection or on another system that is turned off), or wrong driver.
2011-01-26T12:16:00.000Z	Firmin	jhansonxi	I think I'll manage
2011-01-26T12:07:00.000Z	jhansonxi	Firmin	harmless according to https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/cups/+bug/434564/comments/15

2011-01-26T12:12:00.000Z	jhansonxi	Firmin	according to https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BrotherDriverPackaging it should be supported.  Do you have the brother driver package installed?
