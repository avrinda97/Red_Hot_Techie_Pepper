2008-12-15T19:18:00.000Z	freakynl		hi, i found some docs on installing ubuntu _to_ an usb stick, but these all use an option in gnome called create a usb startup disk. I want to install server to it, and the server CD has no gnome... anyone have some docs on that?
2008-12-15T19:19:00.000Z	freakynl		right click on the panel, click add to panel. dunno what it's called, browse the list

2008-12-15T19:20:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	freakynl	script iso2usb might be what ou want
2008-12-15T19:21:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	freakynl	Make an iso on usb bootable http://jak-linux.org/tmp/iso2usb.sh
2008-12-15T19:21:00.000Z	freakynl	Jack_Sparrow	don't think so, that makes my usb stick an installer source, i need the install on the stick. some idiot threw his laptop down the stairs. screen is broken, disk is broken, rest runs fine. so detached the monitor and want to use it as headless server
2009-05-29T18:07:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	freakynl	Did you add sources to your sources.list?
2009-05-29T18:08:00.000Z	freakynl	Jack_Sparrow	nope, plesk adds some of it's own though
2009-05-29T18:08:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	freakynl	Right, it matters not if you added them or ran a script that added them, that is the source of the problem
2009-05-29T18:09:00.000Z	freakynl	Jack_Sparrow	that's a pretty firm conclusion w/o any troubleshooting whatsoever
2009-05-29T18:09:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	freakynl	I would look at the page that you got that program from for help
2009-05-29T18:10:00.000Z	freakynl	Jack_Sparrow	machines freezing == kernel issues. not some apache/php package from some repository
2009-05-29T18:11:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	freakynl	It still can easily be something you added from an unsupported repo, please see #apache pr php or server channel
2009-05-29T18:12:00.000Z	freakynl	Jack_Sparrow	user programs screwing up resulting in kernels issues still equals kernel issues :)
2009-05-29T18:12:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	freakynl	Not our problem if not from stable supported repos
2009-05-29T18:12:00.000Z	freakynl	Jack_Sparrow	the kernel, ldconfig and update tools are from supported repos
2009-05-29T18:14:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	freakynl	Nothing is so perfect a user cant mess it up, please just ask your question and wait for an answer or try elsewhere
2009-05-29T18:41:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	freakynl	We advise against that as well , use sudo -u or -i
