2008-11-02T06:00:00.000Z	temppy	blue_mushroom	do you have evdev installed?
2008-11-02T06:00:00.000Z	blue_mushroom	temppy	I don't know, let me check
2008-11-02T06:00:00.000Z	temppy	blue_mushroom	which flavor of ubuntu are you using?
2008-11-02T06:00:00.000Z	blue_mushroom	temppy	I don't seem to have it.
2008-11-02T06:00:00.000Z	blue_mushroom	temppy	8.04 normal
2008-11-02T06:01:00.000Z	temppy	blue_mushroom	well, try this exact command: sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop^               and dont forget the ^
2008-11-02T06:02:00.000Z	blue_mushroom	temppy	what exactly does the ^ do?
2008-11-02T06:02:00.000Z	temppy	blue_mushroom	just try the command, and you will see, its safe and cancelable
2008-11-02T06:04:00.000Z	blue_mushroom	temppy	it installed the linux headers or something
2008-11-02T06:04:00.000Z	temppy	blue_mushroom	thats it? o well
2008-11-02T06:04:00.000Z	blue_mushroom	temppy	so it should have gotten everything to the newest state and configured?
2008-11-02T06:05:00.000Z	temppy	blue_mushroom	no, it checks the default dependencies.  It doesn't do any upgrading particularly, and no configuring
2008-11-02T06:05:00.000Z	blue_mushroom	temppy	... well that didn't work, should I restart and see if it works?
2008-11-02T06:06:00.000Z	temppy	blue_mushroom	since you are on 8.04, you could try reconfiguring x, but I dunno
2008-11-02T06:06:00.000Z	blue_mushroom	temppy	I'm just in awe that a user can ACTUALLY lose it...
2008-11-02T06:07:00.000Z	blue_mushroom	temppy	The same thing happens if I disable the touchpad... when I want to enable it I can't .
2008-11-02T06:07:00.000Z	blue_mushroom	temppy	unless I restart X
2008-11-02T06:08:00.000Z	temppy	blue_mushroom	yeah, it sucks.  I go for the separate /home, and just reinstall if anything craps out, or I screw anything up.  Clean install, I'm up in running, and I haven't lost any settings
