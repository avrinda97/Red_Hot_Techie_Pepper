2006-05-13T11:47:00.000Z	intelikey	`paul	 readolny is the ,ro, / ,rw,  part.    or  ?mask=    man mount.   or read the link.
2006-05-13T11:49:00.000Z	intelikey	`paul	i doubt that it is mounted ro....  mount   will verify.
2006-05-13T11:50:00.000Z	intelikey	`paul	 only the one line pertaining to the partition in question
2006-05-13T11:50:00.000Z	`paul	intelikey	 /dev/hda1 on /mnt/HD1 type vfat (rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev)
2006-05-13T11:51:00.000Z	`paul	intelikey	 ro is readonly right?
2006-05-13T11:51:00.000Z	`paul	intelikey	 i want it to be rightable
2006-05-13T11:51:00.000Z	`paul	intelikey	 the problem is evrytime i login as a regular user its readonly
2006-05-13T11:52:00.000Z	`paul	intelikey	 i mean i cant even create folders... T_T
2006-05-13T11:53:00.000Z	intelikey	`paul	add that in /etc/fstab
2006-05-13T11:55:00.000Z	intelikey	`paul	here in the irc client type this without quotes. "/exec -o grep -e'/mnt/HD1' /etc/fstab "
2006-05-13T11:57:00.000Z	intelikey	`paul	for ntfs you may want to use fmask and dmask
2006-05-13T11:57:00.000Z	intelikey	`paul	again i sujest    man mount
2006-05-13T11:59:00.000Z	intelikey	`paul	it surely is.
2006-05-13T12:00:00.000Z	intelikey	`paul	there is even a   man fstab    with examples.
2006-05-13T12:03:00.000Z	intelikey	`paul	yes and you should either learn the octal code for linux file attributes or ask.
2006-05-13T12:08:00.000Z	intelikey	`paul	you will be primarily concerned with the last three digits of octal premissions.  they are a octal display of three, three digit binarry marks.   the first shows the owners permission the second the group then everybody else(world)    the binary numbers are   read write execute.  111 = 7 octal    so  755  would be  111 101 101 = rwx r_x r_x
