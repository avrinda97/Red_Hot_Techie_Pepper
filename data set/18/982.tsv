2012-10-24T07:15:00.000Z	ahmad_		quick question guys in bash, what is the best way to append text to a root owned file?
2012-10-24T07:15:00.000Z	ahmad_		i tried  sudo -su -c "echo 'hello' >> /temp/new.txt"
2012-10-24T07:15:00.000Z	ahmad_		it works great, just wondering
2012-10-24T07:17:00.000Z	MestreLion	ahmad_	best is to use sudo tee -a file > /dev/null

2012-10-24T09:12:00.000Z	MestreLion	ahmad_	change your HOST key from Left-CTRL to another key
2012-10-24T09:12:00.000Z	MestreLion	ahmad_	or try using the the other ctrl
2012-10-24T09:15:00.000Z	ahmad_	MestreLion	i was just thinking that :0
2012-10-24T09:15:00.000Z	MestreLion	ahmad_	I have mine set up as right-alt... rarely interferes with anything
