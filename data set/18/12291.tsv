2006-06-08T08:52:00.000Z	tripppy		something weird is happening... i just got a cable modem... it works fine with windows
2006-06-08T08:52:00.000Z	tripppy		not with ubuntu
2006-06-08T08:52:00.000Z	tripppy		red: turn off onboard soundcard in the BIOS
2006-06-08T08:54:00.000Z	tripppy		when i plug cable modem into eth port on windows, i get a auto address via DHCP - i mean im connected now!
2006-06-08T08:54:00.000Z	tripppy		rede: no idea. if you dont need on board one. disable it.
2006-06-08T08:55:00.000Z	tripppy		ubuntu doesnt get auto address from cable modem... i have no idea why
2006-06-08T08:56:00.000Z	nickrud	tripppy	I'm not an networking expert, by any means. But if you have only one ethernet port, add the two lines   auto eth0 <newline> iface eth0 inet dhcp  to /etc/network/interfaces, then sudo ifdown eth0 && sudo ifup eth0
2006-06-08T08:57:00.000Z	tripppy	nickrud	i have two eth's - im did hhave ubuntu setup as my router/FW - with a DSL modem, I moved , got cable.... now its weird
2006-06-08T08:58:00.000Z	nickrud	tripppy	then cut to the chase, pare down /etc/network/interfaces to the bare minimum & get your dhcp working. You can add back the rest later.
2006-06-08T09:00:00.000Z	tripppy	nickrud	sorry. can i send you the config i have on windows
2006-06-08T09:01:00.000Z	nickrud	tripppy	sure, but I don't use windows at all. I'm interested in what it looks like, anyway :)
2006-06-09T05:52:00.000Z	tripppy	nickrud	hey i got ubuntu to find cable modem!
2008-03-03T09:43:00.000Z	nickrud	tripppy	try right clicking the panel, add to panel -> notification area ( most common reason)
2008-03-03T09:44:00.000Z	tripppy	nickrud	that added the battery icon, still no wifi signal
2008-03-03T09:45:00.000Z	nickrud	tripppy	ok, next:   alt-f2 nm-applet --sm-disable
2008-03-03T09:46:00.000Z	tripppy	nickrud	omg thanks
