2007-02-12T12:48:00.000Z	craigbass1976		Can you update one ubuntu install from another box over a network?
2007-02-12T12:50:00.000Z	unop	craigbass1976	 the computer with the packages needs to be setup as a repository -- you can use apt-proxy or apt-mirror .. i prefer the former
2007-02-24T14:21:00.000Z	unop	craigbass1976	 i dont think that is possible out of the box (you could have something (a script perhaps) scan the contents of the directory and change permissions/ownership as and when needed)
2007-02-24T14:21:00.000Z	craigbass1976	unop	and sepheebear, or oes it have something to do with the unix users' unmask?
2007-02-24T14:23:00.000Z	unop	craigbass1976	 in anycase, this isnt the right way to setup samba .. yes check out the umask directive for samba as per samba.org
2007-02-24T14:23:00.000Z	unop	craigbass1976	 samba's umask is a little different to unix's umask
2007-02-24T14:24:00.000Z	craigbass1976	unop	What do you suggest then?  I just want a wide open share on a private network.
2007-02-24T14:25:00.000Z	unop	craigbass1976	 errm, is this an open share (i.e. via guest) or do users need to authenticate themselves to logon to it?
2007-02-24T14:25:00.000Z	craigbass1976	unop	guest ok
2007-02-24T14:26:00.000Z	unop	craigbass1976	 if everyone logs on as guest, i cant see why you are having problems .. are you saying guest cant even change his own files?
2007-02-24T14:28:00.000Z	craigbass1976	unop	no, gues can, but if the user on the ubuntu box makes, or saves changes to, a file, then the others can't access it except for read only.
2007-02-24T14:31:00.000Z	unop	craigbass1976	 ok, it's a ownership issue .. you need to have the guest account and the user in the same group and ensure that the group has write access over the files . it should be ok then
2007-02-24T14:35:00.000Z	craigbass1976	unop	I think like you said earlier that it's got to do with samba's umask.  I forgot that I have OReilly's SAMBA book, and I think I foun what I need in that.
2007-02-24T14:37:00.000Z	unop	craigbass1976	 well, the umask can help -- but if the user creates a file in that directory, he and his group own the file and guest wont have access to it (unless it is world readable/writable etc)
2008-07-06T02:46:00.000Z	unop	craigbass1976	i don't think so
2008-07-06T02:46:00.000Z	unop	craigbass1976	you could use something like crossover office (which is a wine offshoot)
2008-07-06T02:47:00.000Z	unop	craigbass1976	what is wrong with wine anyway?
2009-01-03T20:26:00.000Z	unop	craigbass1976	i just tend to change the UA strings on firefox to masquerade as IE -- and most sites work fine
