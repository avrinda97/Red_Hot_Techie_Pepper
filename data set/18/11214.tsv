2008-02-07T22:48:00.000Z	LjL	bobbob1016	no, an *extended* acts as a primary, and an extended can contain logical partitions
2008-10-12T17:16:00.000Z	LjL	bobbob1016	"depends". if you have an SSD drive, swap will certainly shorten the lifetime of it, although it might possibly not even be measurable. if you have enough RAM, you might try and do without. if you need hibernation, you probably want a swap partition
2008-10-12T17:16:00.000Z	bobbob1016	LjL	I have the SSD, and 1gig ram, I thought not, but the installer warned me so I thought to ask
2008-10-12T17:18:00.000Z	LjL	bobbob1016	1Gb of RAM is enough to run quite a few programs without any need for swap. of course, swap is in theory *always* welcomed by the kernel, which can use it to cache files more efficiently. but concerns over SSD durability might, possibly, overshadow this.
2008-10-12T17:19:00.000Z	bobbob1016	LjL	Thanks, now I just need to think of a name, I was thinking K9...  but not sure
2008-10-12T17:20:00.000Z	LjL	bobbob1016	on an unrelated note, is yours a 90x and do you experience keys "bouncing" (i.e. keypress being registered twice sometimes)?
2008-10-12T17:20:00.000Z	bobbob1016	LjL	901, with the 6cell, I just bought it yesterday
2008-10-12T17:21:00.000Z	LjL	bobbob1016	same here (except i bought it the day before yesterday). i have this slight keyboard issue however
2008-10-12T17:21:00.000Z	LjL	bobbob1016	by the way, you might like to know there is an #ubuntu-eeepc channel
2008-10-12T17:22:00.000Z	bobbob1016	LjL	Oh, I thought there would be one, but I'll try that next time, thanks
2008-10-12T17:23:00.000Z	bobbob1016	LjL	One last thing, doesn't the EEE move the partition or something, to extend the amount of writes?  And does it have a warning your drive is about to go thing, since it is predictable on a flash drive?
2008-10-12T17:24:00.000Z	LjL	bobbob1016	it doesn't move any partitions. it simply uses wear levelling like every SD drive should, but that's implemented at the hardware level. and no, no warnings (and it's not *that* predictable, either!)
2008-10-12T17:25:00.000Z	LjL	bobbob1016	i don't have any hard data to offer. but of course, unless Asus is incredibly stupid, yes, it should last quite a while under normal use...
2008-10-12T17:26:00.000Z	LjL	bobbob1016	it's not like HDs don't fail, either. actually, they can fail pretty often.
2008-10-12T17:26:00.000Z	LjL	bobbob1016	you lose the data on the block that breaks
2008-10-12T17:27:00.000Z	bobbob1016	LjL	Yeah, which is why I got the SSD vs the standard one.  I'll just have it sync, or not leave anything important on it.  I was confused since someone told me that it rotates space or something.  Thanks for the help.
2008-10-12T17:29:00.000Z	LjL	bobbob1016	it does "rotate". it's called wear levelling. it doesn't write to the same block twice. the specific algorithm is probably unpublished, but it does most likely have a linked list of blocks it rotates within
2008-10-12T17:30:00.000Z	LjL	bobbob1016	as with any storage device, yes, you should keep backups - the fact that it's SSD doesn't spare you from keeping backups if you care about the data
