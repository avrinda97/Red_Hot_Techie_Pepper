2006-10-18T16:14:00.000Z	variant	dhq	via ftp: wget -r ftp://etcetc.org/*
2006-10-18T16:18:00.000Z	dhq	variant	its a http
2006-10-18T16:18:00.000Z	dhq	variant	when i use that command only the html and gif files copy i need all the files
2006-10-18T16:29:00.000Z	variant	dhq	wget -m will mirror a site
2006-10-18T16:30:00.000Z	variant	dhq	it wont download scripts that are server side though, only the resulting output from those scripts
2006-10-18T16:30:00.000Z	dhq	variant	-m means all the files with directories etc rite
2006-10-18T16:30:00.000Z	dhq	variant	but i need thee scripts also
2006-10-18T16:30:00.000Z	variant	dhq	it means mirror image, every file needed to display the site.. you might want to add recursion and spidering but be carefull
2006-10-18T16:31:00.000Z	variant	dhq	then you need local access to the server
2006-10-18T16:31:00.000Z	variant	dhq	thats the point with server side scripts..
2006-10-18T16:31:00.000Z	dhq	variant	oh ok
2006-10-18T16:31:00.000Z	variant	dhq	it's impossible to get those without "cracking" the site or being an admin/having ssh access
2006-10-18T16:32:00.000Z	dhq	variant	k
2006-10-18T16:32:00.000Z	dhq	variant	even java scripts
2006-10-18T05:00:00.000Z	variant	dhq	javascript is part of the html page normally, or in a seperate file. you should be able to get that
