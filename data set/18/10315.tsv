2006-12-27T08:39:00.000Z	un_operateur	Some_Person	ken, exact error message needed to STW :)
2006-12-28T11:40:00.000Z	un_operateur	Some_Person	your modem doesnt happen to be a PPPoE modem, does it?
2006-12-28T11:48:00.000Z	un_operateur	Some_Person	you shouldnt need to be configuring pppoeconf on linux because your should just be getting a DHCP lease from the router
2006-12-28T11:50:00.000Z	un_operateur	Some_Person	your router might not be a DHCP server (or DHCP serving was disabled on it) ..
2006-12-28T11:50:00.000Z	un_operateur	Some_Person	you on windows now, right?
2006-12-28T11:50:00.000Z	un_operateur	Some_Person	can you pastebin the output of your  ipconfig /all command?
2006-12-28T11:55:00.000Z	un_operateur	Some_Person	are you willing to boot up ubuntu to try this out again?
