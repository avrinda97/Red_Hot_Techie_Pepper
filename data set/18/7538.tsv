2007-12-22T11:11:00.000Z	FluxD		Hi, I setup a VNC server but am getting a connection error. Can someone help?
2007-12-22T11:12:00.000Z	computertech99	FluxD	sure what is the error?
2007-12-22T11:13:00.000Z	FluxD	computertech99	cratel : I used this tutorial https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VNC installed that using ssh. Now on windows when trying to connect it wont connect
2007-12-22T11:17:00.000Z	computertech99	FluxD	there are lots of things to check. One, do you have a firewall in windows? 2: have you installed the vnc server in ubuntu. 3: do you have a router? 4 is this windows machine part of the home network or somewhere else?
2007-12-22T11:21:00.000Z	computertech99	FluxD	on which machine?
2007-12-22T11:21:00.000Z	FluxD	computertech99	ubuntu
2007-12-22T11:22:00.000Z	computertech99	FluxD	I always check my ports here: https://www.grc.com/x/ne.dll?bh0bkyd2

2007-12-22T11:26:00.000Z	computertech99	FluxD	netstat -tap
2007-12-22T11:27:00.000Z	FluxD	computertech99	I want something like canyouseeme.org
2007-12-22T11:28:00.000Z	computertech99	FluxD	install nmap then?

2007-12-22T11:31:00.000Z	FluxD	computertech99	lol I meant what do I type in nmap to see if it is connectable?
2007-12-22T11:33:00.000Z	computertech99	FluxD	nmap -v -A 192.168.1.1-255 or just put in your IP address on the network.
2007-12-22T11:35:00.000Z	computertech99	FluxD	that will show you all the open ports on your computer/network
2007-12-22T11:36:00.000Z	FluxD	computertech99	what if I want to see from my windows computer the same info
2007-12-22T11:36:00.000Z	computertech99	FluxD	install nmap and do the same command.
