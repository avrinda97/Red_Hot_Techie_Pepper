2008-05-07T21:22:00.000Z	soundray	bitchompR	see if this driver is compatible: http://sourceforge.net/projects/sdricohcs/
2008-05-07T21:23:00.000Z	bitchompR	soundray	I'll check it out, thanks.
2008-05-07T21:24:00.000Z	soundray	bitchompR	is yours built into a laptop?
2008-05-07T21:24:00.000Z	bitchompR	soundray	I have a desktop with a built in card reader.
2008-05-07T21:24:00.000Z	soundray	bitchompR	do you know how it's connected internally? USB?
2008-05-07T21:25:00.000Z	bitchompR	soundray	it's connected internally, not usb
2008-05-07T21:25:00.000Z	soundray	bitchompR	the devices that the sdricoh driver supports is mostly found in laptops
2008-05-07T21:25:00.000Z	soundray	bitchompR	it can still be USB, even if it's internal
2008-05-07T21:26:00.000Z	bitchompR	soundray	the pc cover is off and it's not usb
2008-05-07T21:27:00.000Z	soundray	bitchompR	how is it connected then?
2008-05-07T21:27:00.000Z	bitchompR	soundray	how do I install that file I downloaded?
2008-05-07T21:28:00.000Z	soundray	bitchompR	leave it off for now, until you know how it is connected
2008-05-07T21:29:00.000Z	bitchompR	soundray	my bad, it is usb. I just checked again and it plugs into usb2 on motherboard
2008-05-07T21:29:00.000Z	soundray	bitchompR	then it should be plug and play. Does it show when you enter 'lsusb' in a terminal?
2008-05-07T21:30:00.000Z	bitchompR	soundray	yes it shows up as - Bus 005 Device 004: ID 05e3:0760 Genesys Logic, Inc. USB 2.0 Card Reader/Writer
2008-05-07T21:30:00.000Z	bitchompR	soundray	but it doesn't detect my SD card when inserted
2008-05-07T21:30:00.000Z	soundray	bitchompR	do a 'tail -f /var/log/syslog' and insert an SD card. Any messages?
2008-05-07T21:32:00.000Z	bitchompR	soundray	It works! thanks!
