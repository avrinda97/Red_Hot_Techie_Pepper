2005-12-21T12:07:00.000Z	acid2		Hey ho
2005-12-21T12:07:00.000Z	acid2		I'm currently spending a bit of time sorting my Ubuntu out, making it work just how I want it - and Totem is causing me some issues
2005-12-21T12:08:00.000Z	acid2		When I try and view movies in Firefox I just get a dialog saying "The totem plugin could not startup: The video output is in use by another application"
2005-12-21T12:08:00.000Z	acid2		Although, I have nothing else that would be using video stuff...
2005-12-21T12:08:00.000Z	acid2		any ideas?
2005-12-21T12:09:00.000Z	acid2		darn
2005-12-21T12:09:00.000Z	acid2		I'll see if that happens when I try and open movies just using totem..
2005-12-21T12:09:00.000Z	acid2		I can't even start Totem because the same error occurs
2005-12-21T12:11:00.000Z	_jason	acid2	has this always happened?
2005-12-22T07:50:00.000Z	_jason	acid2	system -> prefs -> fonts, mine look like that too.  I have subpixel smooting on (If you have an LCD you should use that)
2005-12-22T07:50:00.000Z	acid2	_jason	right, I've done that
2005-12-22T07:51:00.000Z	_jason	acid2	^
2005-12-22T07:52:00.000Z	_jason	acid2	Sans
2005-12-22T07:52:00.000Z	_jason	acid2	monospace for terminal
2005-12-22T07:52:00.000Z	_jason	acid2	how would I check my font engine?
2005-12-22T07:53:00.000Z	_jason	acid2	I guess default then
2005-12-22T07:53:00.000Z	_jason	acid2	my font size is 10, I notice that at different sizes it's not as crisp
2005-12-22T07:54:00.000Z	acid2	_jason	ya
