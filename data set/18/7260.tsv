2008-09-07T23:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sunil_	you may need to disable wake on lan in windows. ive seen this a few times
2008-09-07T23:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sunil_	windows may have "locked" the nic

2008-09-07T23:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sunil_	basically jump in windows device manager and for the NIC, invert the option for wake n lan
2008-09-07T23:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sunil_	its locking the nic so ubuntu cant use it
2008-09-07T23:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sunil_	yes
2008-09-07T23:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sunil_	reboot to windows and invert the wake on lan in device manager
