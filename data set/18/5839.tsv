2008-08-22T04:36:00.000Z	speener		i have a question? when i fetch all the cover art for my music, does it save the images in the same dir as the file?
2008-08-22T04:36:00.000Z	speener		will all the album art be available for other players? including those in windows?

2008-08-22T04:37:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	speener	using rhythmbox?
2008-08-22T04:37:00.000Z	speener	Odd-rationale	amarok
2008-08-22T04:38:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	speener	ok. i don't know how that works...
2008-08-22T04:40:00.000Z	speener	Odd-rationale	how does rythmbox handle this issue?
2008-08-22T04:42:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	speener	well, first it checks the local music dir (the one the music file is in) for any png, jpg with the name "cover". If none, then it goes online and downloads a cover and stores it to ~/.gnome2/rhythmbox/covers and saves it as "<artist> - <album"
2008-08-22T04:43:00.000Z	speener	Odd-rationale	is there a way to save the files in the same dir as the song file?
2008-08-22T04:43:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	speener	in amarok, i beleive there was a plugin to do just that... let me see if i can find it...
2008-08-22T04:45:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	speener	you're not using amarok 2, are you?
2008-08-22T04:45:00.000Z	speener	Odd-rationale	nope
2008-08-22T04:46:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	speener	then this should work: http://www.kde-apps.org/content/show.php/CopyCover+(amaroK+Script)?content=22517
2008-08-22T04:49:00.000Z	speener	Odd-rationale	thanx man, i'll try it out
2008-08-22T04:49:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	speener	np
2008-08-22T05:01:00.000Z	speener	Odd-rationale	thanx...it works well, the only thing is that it add the image once a song from the album has been played...
2008-08-22T05:01:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	speener	correct, the scrip runs only when a song from the album is played...
2008-08-22T05:02:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	speener	if you havne't played it yet, then you don't need the cover art... :P
