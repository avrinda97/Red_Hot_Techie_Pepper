2008-09-30T06:20:00.000Z	carandraug	pibe86	if you had 8.04 64 bits, then yes, you should
2008-09-30T06:21:00.000Z	pibe86	carandraug	ok, so when stable relase is ready, will i have  upgrade again 795 mb more or less?
2008-09-30T06:22:00.000Z	carandraug	pibe86	no. You should be making small upgrades everyday. When the final release comes out, I think it'll be just a small upgrade for you
2008-09-30T06:22:00.000Z	pibe86	carandraug	ok now i understand
2008-09-30T06:23:00.000Z	pibe86	carandraug	 i am upgrading because i have a laptop and it does not reconice my wireless red
2008-09-30T06:23:00.000Z	pibe86	carandraug	maybe with new kernel it will works
