2010-10-15T03:10:00.000Z	yagoo	Robinux	it's rebooting.. took about 10-15 minutes
2010-10-15T03:10:00.000Z	yagoo	Robinux	yep..
2010-10-15T03:11:00.000Z	yagoo	Robinux	vbox is good too.. haven't tried it on vbox
2010-10-15T03:11:00.000Z	yagoo	Robinux	not keeping track of time.. i'd say about 8-10 minutes ...
2010-10-15T03:12:00.000Z	yagoo	Robinux	-> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Multitouch#Hardware%20Support
2010-10-15T03:12:00.000Z	yagoo	Robinux	am looking forward to see what multitouch can do ubuntu..
2010-10-15T03:17:00.000Z	yagoo	Robinux	are you using ubunut permanently in the vbox? (there are accelerators for it-- but not sure for ubuntu v10.10)
2010-10-15T03:18:00.000Z	Robinux	yagoo	ubuntu 10.10  it is, but its just a live-cd
2010-10-15T03:19:00.000Z	yagoo	Robinux	you should check that out.. if u plan on using vbox permanently.. (virtualbox developers may call it "add-on" software for a particular linux-- which installs accelerated drivers for the VM machine)
2010-10-15T03:22:00.000Z	yagoo	Robinux	"apropos package" :p
