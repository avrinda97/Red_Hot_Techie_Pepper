2006-09-17T13:28:00.000Z	JoseStefan	Qu1ckFr0st	this command should change your sources.list without much trouble:  sudo sed -e 's/\shoary/breezy/g' -i /etc/apt/sources.list
2006-09-17T13:36:00.000Z	JoseStefan	Qu1ckFr0st	synaptic is closed now, right?
2006-09-17T13:37:00.000Z	JoseStefan	Qu1ckFr0st	you wouldn't happen to know how to use vi, or nano?
2006-09-17T13:43:00.000Z	JoseStefan	Qu1ckFr0st	make sure all gedit are closed, and synaptic too
2006-09-17T13:44:00.000Z	JoseStefan	Qu1ckFr0st	Flannel: you might want to give gedit another shot
2006-09-17T13:47:00.000Z	JoseStefan	Qu1ckFr0st	and double check :P dont miss any
2006-09-17T13:49:00.000Z	JoseStefan	Qu1ckFr0st	you can skip the lines that begin with ##, aka comments
2006-09-17T13:50:00.000Z	JoseStefan	Qu1ckFr0st	but then you'll have outdated comments :(
2006-09-17T13:50:00.000Z	Qu1ckFr0st	JoseStefan	does it even matter if the comments are outdated ? lol
2006-09-17T13:51:00.000Z	JoseStefan	Qu1ckFr0st	10 years from now you might be reading those comments, and be all confused
2006-09-17T13:51:00.000Z	Qu1ckFr0st	JoseStefan	just hope you arent in this channel 10 yrs from now
2006-09-17T13:52:00.000Z	JoseStefan	Qu1ckFr0st	what line?
2006-09-17T13:54:00.000Z	JoseStefan	Qu1ckFr0st	does it begin with # ?
2006-09-17T13:54:00.000Z	JoseStefan	Qu1ckFr0st	add the # prefix to it, so it becomes a comment
2006-09-17T13:57:00.000Z	JoseStefan	Qu1ckFr0st	Flannel: the breezy notes are a bit old, i suggest we continue guiding
2006-09-17T13:58:00.000Z	JoseStefan	Qu1ckFr0st	sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade     (all together)
2006-09-17T13:58:00.000Z	JoseStefan	Qu1ckFr0st	apt-get is prefered, for release upgrades
