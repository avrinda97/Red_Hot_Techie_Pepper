2009-08-03T19:46:00.000Z	Raenir		yoyo I have a problem with my display
2009-08-03T19:46:00.000Z	Raenir		basically in 8.04 I used EnvyNG to activate dual monitors
2009-08-03T19:46:00.000Z	Raenir		im getting to it
2009-08-03T19:46:00.000Z	Raenir		when I upgraded to 8.10 it screwed up my display
2009-08-03T19:47:00.000Z	Raenir		basically my main monitor was all black and pushed my display to the second monitor
2009-08-03T19:47:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Raenir	is  envng  still in the repo for 8.10 and 9.04?
2009-08-03T19:58:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Raenir	dual monitor issues oh right
2009-08-03T19:59:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Raenir	no, and I am not geek enough to have a dual monitor at this time :D    plus this widescreen  is rather nice :)
2009-08-03T20:00:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Raenir	anyway  the dual monitor issues oh I know, those can be  pretty tricky to sort out
2009-08-03T20:00:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Raenir	to one paragraph more like it :D
2009-08-03T20:01:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Raenir	well I don't see anyone active in here right now,  that  I think can probably help you,   and  I guess your issue isn't  distro specific, so give ##linux a try
2009-10-03T03:28:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Raenir	yes
2009-10-03T03:29:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Raenir	only the open source version, which lacks USB support, but you  can get the other version for Linux hosts http://www.virtualbox.org  ,but then USB needs setting up as well #vbox for help with that
2009-10-03T03:32:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Raenir	ok you can't install it from inside Ubuntu
2009-10-03T03:32:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Raenir	with the exception of a virtual machine
2009-10-03T03:32:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Raenir	also you will need enough RAM
2009-10-03T03:33:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Raenir	and I think that some OEM  versions of  Windows won't work in a virtual machine
2009-10-03T03:37:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Raenir	ok good
