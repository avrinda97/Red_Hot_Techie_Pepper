2010-12-14T00:12:00.000Z	Typh	histo	but if I then try to install, I get the same error once more.
2010-12-14T00:09:00.000Z	histo	Typh	can you purge that package?
2010-12-14T00:09:00.000Z	Typh	histo	I have, same error when I reinstall
2010-12-14T00:10:00.000Z	histo	Typh	can you purge the package?
2010-12-14T00:10:00.000Z	Typh	histo	uh... pardon? As I just said, I have.
2010-12-14T00:11:00.000Z	histo	Typh	no you said it happens when you reinstall purging is different remove configs and everything for the package
2010-12-14T00:11:00.000Z	Typh	histo	I also said that "I have". As in "I have purged."
2010-12-14T00:12:00.000Z	histo	Typh	maybe clean your apt cache and re download the package perhaps the one you have is corrupt
2010-12-14T00:13:00.000Z	histo	Typh	try purging it then remove the deb from /var/cache/apt/archives/
2010-12-14T00:14:00.000Z	Typh	histo	no change :(
2010-12-14T00:15:00.000Z	histo	Typh	after the deb is removed then install the package
2010-12-14T00:15:00.000Z	histo	Typh	make sure it redownloads it
2010-12-14T00:15:00.000Z	histo	Typh	if not maybe the package is broken from whatever mirror you are using
2010-12-14T00:16:00.000Z	Typh	histo	no change, and I'm using http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/
2010-12-14T00:17:00.000Z	histo	Typh	I'm not running 10.10 so I can't check the package
2010-12-14T00:17:00.000Z	histo	Typh	maybe someone else can help
2010-12-14T00:18:00.000Z	Typh	histo	thanks anyways
