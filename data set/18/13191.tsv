2006-05-24T06:57:00.000Z	byteshack		I'm running xubuntu, and I would like to know how to change the default terminal to be xterm, instead of "Terminal"
2006-05-24T06:57:00.000Z	byteshack		when ever ubuntu needs a term, it opens that Terminal program, but I'd like to use xterm instead
2006-05-24T06:58:00.000Z	byteshack		how can I do that?
2006-05-24T06:58:00.000Z	byteshack		"that terminal" meaning xfterm4
2006-05-24T06:59:00.000Z	amphi	byteshack	try sudo update-alternatives --config x-terminal-emulator perhaps
2006-05-24T07:00:00.000Z	byteshack	amphi	how can I find out what it is set to right now?
2006-05-24T07:00:00.000Z	amphi	byteshack	that'll show yoy
2006-05-24T07:01:00.000Z	byteshack	amphi	thanks
2006-05-24T07:08:00.000Z	amphi	byteshack	you have some fancy prompt
2006-05-24T07:09:00.000Z	amphi	byteshack	he's probably been told not to repeat ;)
2006-05-24T07:11:00.000Z	amphi	byteshack	well, not that then; I used to have some extravagant prompts, but they didn't have noticeable overhead
2006-05-24T07:11:00.000Z	amphi	byteshack	what about rxvt? same?
2006-05-24T07:13:00.000Z	amphi	byteshack	something is deeply wrong...
2006-05-24T07:14:00.000Z	amphi	byteshack	as an experiment, you could try from a VT xinit -- :1 and then run xterm from the term that appears automagically
2006-05-24T07:22:00.000Z	amphi	byteshack	was it the same in a bare X server started with xinit?
2006-05-24T07:22:00.000Z	amphi	byteshack	I'm looking to blame gnome here ;)
2006-05-24T07:22:00.000Z	amphi	byteshack	better to do xinit -- :1 from a VT IMHO
2006-05-24T07:23:00.000Z	amphi	byteshack	oh, no gnome to vilify then, damn ;)
