2009-02-11T13:19:00.000Z	mattycoze		has anyone used octave before?
2009-02-11T13:20:00.000Z	mattycoze		is there a gui frontend for octave?
2009-02-11T13:21:00.000Z	mattycoze		robbe it is similar. actually is matlab available for linux?
2009-02-11T13:22:00.000Z	mattycoze		i read somewhere that it was... but it's proprietary software right?
2009-02-11T13:22:00.000Z	mattycoze		robbe grr... i see; oh well i might have better luck running a windows SPSS through wine
2009-02-11T13:23:00.000Z	mattycoze		*rrrrr*?
2009-02-11T13:23:00.000Z	rakudave	mattycoze	depending on what you intend to do, there is better frss software available, check out GeoGebra for instance
2009-02-11T13:23:00.000Z	rakudave		*free
2009-02-11T13:24:00.000Z	mattycoze	rakudave	& robbe, well actually i'm trying to practice multivariate analysis, logistic regression, MANOVA and MANCOVA
2009-02-11T13:25:00.000Z	mattycoze		i'm doing advanced stats courses at the moment and I'm expected to learn how to analyse some practice data sets they've given me bah.
2009-02-11T13:26:00.000Z	rakudave	mattycoze	ok, then octave is you best bet. perhaps wxMaxima can handle it (GUI), it is similat to Mathematica (Wolfram research)
2009-02-11T13:26:00.000Z	mattycoze		so octave has a GUI?
2009-02-11T13:27:00.000Z	mattycoze		(@ rakudave)
2009-02-11T13:28:00.000Z	rakudave	mattycoze	no, octave itself doesn't, but there are projects such as YetAnotherOctaveGui, see yaog.sourceforge.net
2009-02-11T13:28:00.000Z	mattycoze		oh i see
2009-02-11T13:28:00.000Z	mattycoze		cool!
2009-02-11T13:31:00.000Z	mattycoze		i'll have a go with the q-octave since they've already got a deb for it Digital8 & rakudave
2009-02-11T13:32:00.000Z	rakudave	mattycoze	good luck :-)
