2008-06-14T06:21:00.000Z	kat_aq		anyone who could help me with a possibly simple problem with compiz? The expo doesnt pan out the windows, instead it shows all the workspaces.
2008-06-14T06:23:00.000Z	nickrud	kat_aq	that's the expo behavior in compiz
2008-06-14T06:24:00.000Z	kat_aq	nickrud	ok, but i dont remember changing anything?
2008-06-14T06:26:00.000Z	nickrud	kat_aq	not sure, expo (super-e) has always shown me all my desktops. I like having the lower left corner of the screen react to the mouse, showing them all and letting me move stuff from desktop to desktop
2008-06-14T06:27:00.000Z	kat_aq	nickrud	oh ok. so you dont use it to show all your windows then?
2008-06-14T06:27:00.000Z	nickrud	kat_aq	no, all my desktops
2008-06-14T06:29:00.000Z	kat_aq	nickrud	there's is no where that lets me choose what it shows though.
2008-06-14T06:30:00.000Z	nickrud	kat_aq	I have never seen expo show all my windows. I'm not sure what plugin you're thinking of
2008-06-14T06:31:00.000Z	kat_aq	nickrud	oh ok. oh well. maybe it wasnt expo then. i just remember i had this shortcut where all my windows became smaller and i was tiled on my workspace and i thought that was expo
2008-06-14T06:31:00.000Z	nickrud	kat_aq	I think you mean scale
2008-06-14T06:32:00.000Z	nickrud	kat_aq	yup, scale . Ctl-alt-up arrow
2008-06-14T06:32:00.000Z	nickrud	kat_aq	erm, shift-alt-up
2008-06-14T06:33:00.000Z	nickrud	kat_aq	gonna have to play with that one myself, I think I like it ;)
2008-06-14T06:33:00.000Z	kat_aq	nickrud	 you're welcome then :P
2008-06-14T06:33:00.000Z	kat_aq	nickrud	but thanks! that helped
2008-06-14T06:36:00.000Z	nickrud	kat_aq	3 is the middle button (or 1 & 2 together if you don't have a 3 button mouse) , the others are usually on the side of the mouse
2008-06-14T06:37:00.000Z	kat_aq	nickrud	oh i see. ok thanks. my mouse only has 3 then =P
2008-06-14T06:38:00.000Z	nickrud	kat_aq	you you around
