2008-12-23T04:05:00.000Z	relik77080		hi - i found out my wireless card is disabled.... its a Intel Pro Wireless 3945ABG
2008-12-23T04:05:00.000Z	relik77080		some please help
2008-12-23T04:05:00.000Z	relik77080		i've searched google but I dont understand what to do
2008-12-23T04:05:00.000Z	tiyowan	relik77080	Go to a terminal and type ifconfig. Do you see wlan0 as UP?
2008-12-23T04:13:00.000Z	tiyowan	relik77080	Are you using a laptop?
2008-12-23T04:14:00.000Z	relik77080	tiyowan	yes
2008-12-23T04:14:00.000Z	relik77080	tiyowan	acer travelmate 8204wlmi
2008-12-23T04:14:00.000Z	tiyowan	relik77080	Is your wireless card switched on? As in do you see the Wi-fi light?
2008-12-23T04:16:00.000Z	tiyowan	relik77080	Do you  have windows on your system as well?
2008-12-23T04:16:00.000Z	relik77080	tiyowan	i ran lshw and it says wireless network DISABLED - but i've tried toggling the front mounted switch - doesnt help...... tiyowan yes i have xp as a dual boot
2008-12-23T04:16:00.000Z	tiyowan	relik77080	Does the wi-fi work from windows?
2008-12-23T04:17:00.000Z	relik77080	tiyowan	yes it did - but i recently formatted windows and havent reinstalled
2008-12-23T04:17:00.000Z	tiyowan	relik77080	Ok. Please wait for one moment.
2008-12-23T04:20:00.000Z	tiyowan	relik77080	I  have the same card. The light should switch on when the wireless card is operating. Do you see it when you run lspci?
2008-12-23T04:21:00.000Z	relik77080	tiyowan	no
2008-12-23T04:21:00.000Z	tiyowan	relik77080	Do you see a line beginning with "Network controller" when you run lspci?
2008-12-23T04:22:00.000Z	tiyowan	relik77080	I'd say that front-mounted switch is busted.
2008-12-23T04:24:00.000Z	tiyowan	relik77080	I'm using intel 3945 on 8.10. The light comes on, or at least blinks before tweaking.
