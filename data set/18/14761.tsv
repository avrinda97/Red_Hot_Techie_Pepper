2008-02-07T01:34:00.000Z	Photo1		Zaehias: Can you access the router's web interface by surfing to 127.0.0.1 (or similar)?
2008-02-07T01:34:00.000Z	Photo1		(to see if the router is alive)
2008-02-07T01:34:00.000Z	Photo1		If the router works for other pcs/OSes it's fine I guess
2008-02-07T01:35:00.000Z	Photo1		Ah, no router? Got it. You should test it on another computer tho.
2008-02-07T01:35:00.000Z	Photo1		It works? Well, then it's in Linux.
2008-02-07T01:37:00.000Z	Photo1		Can anyone recommend a 3D game or demo that benchmarks my Ubuntu? :)
2008-02-07T01:38:00.000Z	Photo1		OK, will try it :)
2008-02-07T01:40:00.000Z	Photo1		I can't believe google.com/linuxing for glxgears download gives me nothing !
2008-02-07T01:42:00.000Z	Photo1		That's not much of a demo. :P No huge maps, no textures with anisotropic etc...
2008-02-07T01:43:00.000Z	Photo1		Well, it's not much of a real world benchmark if it just tests poly fillrate...
2008-02-07T01:44:00.000Z	erUSUL	Photo1	install the quake wars demo...
2008-02-07T01:44:00.000Z	Photo1		modern gfx cards have pixelshaders, antialiasing quality levels, pixelpipe fx...

2008-02-07T01:44:00.000Z	Photo1		Yeah, I was thinking of installing some id games :) But I have to compile them, right?
2008-02-07T01:46:00.000Z	Photo1	hwilde	yeah, I've heard about it... but DX support is not perfect yet, is it?
2008-02-07T01:46:00.000Z	Photo1		Wouldn't mind installing my Quake 3 - but do I really run it in cedega?
