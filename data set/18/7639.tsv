2007-12-28T05:23:00.000Z	LimCore		why  https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ttf-bitstream-vera/+bug/11180  is still not fixed  (and others reported months ago)
2007-12-28T05:24:00.000Z	Slart	LimCore	talk to canonical.. everyone here is a ubuntu user just like you.. if you want to yell at someone, at least yell at someone that's making money of it =)
2007-12-28T05:25:00.000Z	LimCore	Slart	ok
2008-02-19T21:56:00.000Z	Slart	LimCore	it has done that for me since the last 7 months
2008-02-19T22:03:00.000Z	Slart	LimCore	if you only want bugfree apps I don't really know what you can run.. ubuntu is definately out of the question..
2008-02-19T22:04:00.000Z	LimCore	Slart	this is unfortunate
2008-02-19T22:07:00.000Z	Slart	LimCore	this isn't really the place to discuss ubuntu's amount of bugs.. it's a support channel.. there are other channels for general discussion..
2008-02-19T22:10:00.000Z	LimCore	Slart	ok can you then comment on my bug report,
2008-02-19T22:10:00.000Z	Slart	LimCore	got a link to the bug report?
2008-02-19T22:19:00.000Z	Slart	LimCore	I can confirm the bug on Gutsy, 64 bit.. same behavious as the example
2008-02-19T22:22:00.000Z	LimCore	Slart	see? broken :-/
2008-02-19T22:22:00.000Z	Slart	LimCore	works nicely for me. I don't use fields that much
2008-02-19T22:23:00.000Z	LimCore	Slart	its show stopper for me :/
2008-02-29T05:25:00.000Z	Slart	LimCore	I think the server version doesn't install gnome/kde/xfce
2008-02-29T05:25:00.000Z	LimCore	Slart	but it is the same distro, only it installs less by default?
2008-02-29T05:26:00.000Z	Slart	LimCore	it's the same distro
2008-06-18T17:05:00.000Z	LimCore	Slart	sure you can
2008-06-18T18:15:00.000Z	Slart	LimCore	sudo blkid
