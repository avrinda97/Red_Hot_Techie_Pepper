2011-08-28T04:48:00.000Z	EzeQL		im installing ubuntu in the same hd as win7
2011-08-28T04:48:00.000Z	urlin2u	EzeQL	cool, are you familiar with partition amount lintations
2011-08-28T04:49:00.000Z	urlin2u	EzeQL	how many other partitions do you have as seen from linux
2011-08-28T04:50:00.000Z	urlin2u	EzeQL	cool if that is correct as 4 primaries is the limit the 100 gig should be a extended type, and the one inside xt4 and a swap
2011-08-28T04:52:00.000Z	urlin2u	EzeQL	a swap which will be inside of the extended is equal to your ram to have hibernate.
2011-08-28T04:52:00.000Z	urlin2u	EzeQL	the extended is a partion to put the ext type and swap in.
2011-08-28T05:14:00.000Z	urlin2u	EzeQL	gpared is on the live cd
2011-08-28T05:18:00.000Z	urlin2u	EzeQL	you on the unity desktop applications is a button in the left panel

2011-08-28T05:30:00.000Z	urlin2u	EzeQL	/
2011-08-28T05:30:00.000Z	urlin2u	EzeQL	choose /
2011-08-28T05:31:00.000Z	urlin2u	EzeQL	not sure where your at you would not touch those, are you in the something other partitioning area?
2011-08-28T05:32:00.000Z	urlin2u	EzeQL	you only need to confirm where you want ubuntu and the grub placement in that gui, and the monut for the ext4 partition=/
2011-08-28T05:33:00.000Z	urlin2u	EzeQL	yeah just make sure you have the ext4 as the point of install.
2011-08-28T05:34:00.000Z	urlin2u	EzeQL	first gui after choosing that are below screen, grub to the mbr only probably sda
2011-08-28T05:34:00.000Z	urlin2u	EzeQL	grub is in the first gui on choosing something else below the partition screen
