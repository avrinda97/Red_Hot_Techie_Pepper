2007-12-03T00:23:00.000Z	macksting		So nobody here uses CVS?
2007-12-03T00:25:00.000Z	robdig	macksting	what is your question?
2007-12-03T00:25:00.000Z	macksting		Robdig: Well, to be honest, I can't figure out how to get files from CVS. The program helpfully throws me an unhelpful list of commands.
2007-12-03T00:26:00.000Z	macksting		For instance, what on earth is the repository?
2007-12-03T00:26:00.000Z	robdig	macksting	the repository is where the software lives
2007-12-03T00:27:00.000Z	robdig	macksting	for example, if you want to compile foo from source for some reason, you would connect to foo's source repository and down load what you want
2007-12-03T00:27:00.000Z	macksting		So I'd want to download from an existing repository. And none of the commands seem to indicate how to do that. Not to my dense, aggravated mind, anyway.
2007-12-03T00:29:00.000Z	macksting	PriceChild	I'm trying to get GearHead to run. Jedi-SDL doesn't seem to exist in apt's stuff or Synaptic, but a forum user got the latest version from CVS. I'd download it from the website, but the website doesn't seem to have a version for Debian.
2007-12-03T00:29:00.000Z	macksting		So I'm trying to get Jedi-SDL from CVS.
2007-12-03T00:30:00.000Z	macksting		Dooglus says "checkout"'s the command I want for that.
2007-12-03T00:36:00.000Z	macksting		How do you search in cvs?
2007-12-03T00:38:00.000Z	macksting		Dooglus: I think you're missing my question somewhat; I'll try to be more clear. Somebody on the forum says there's a version of jedi-sdl on cvs. I couldn't checkout it by that name, or even close variations of that name. Therefore, unless I can search the... source or whatever for key words, I won't know what to download.
2007-12-03T00:39:00.000Z	macksting		...unspecified?
2007-12-03T00:41:00.000Z	macksting		Thanks, Dooglus.
2007-12-03T00:42:00.000Z	macksting		Now how to figure out what module name I'm looking for. I'll WAG this first one.
2007-12-03T00:42:00.000Z	macksting		Well that's something.
2007-12-03T00:43:00.000Z	macksting		Yeah, my WAG worked accordingly.
2007-12-03T00:49:00.000Z	robdig	macksting	are you still looking for your jedi-sdl answer? if so, i think i have your answer on pastebin http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/46621/
