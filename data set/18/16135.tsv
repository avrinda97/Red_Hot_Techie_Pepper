2005-07-20T11:08:00.000Z	delire	m411iq	usually i look for the new drive with fdisk -l, create a mount point  and modify /etc/fstab accordindly.
2005-07-20T11:08:00.000Z	delire	m411iq	what fs is the second hard drive?
2005-07-20T11:09:00.000Z	delire	m411iq	have you tried doing it from the command line?
2005-07-20T11:09:00.000Z	delire	m411iq	dataw0lf has the right suggestion.
2005-07-20T11:10:00.000Z	delire	m411iq	try dataw0lf's suggestion and let us know.
2005-07-20T11:13:00.000Z	delire	m411iq	paste the error in a pastebin
2005-07-20T11:15:00.000Z	delire	m411iq	which one?
2005-07-20T11:16:00.000Z	delire	m411iq	what was the command you gave?
2005-07-20T11:18:00.000Z	delire	m411iq	type 'fdisk -l | grep NTFS' and paste the output here.
2005-07-20T11:18:00.000Z	delire	m411iq	or perhaps 'fdisk -l | grep ntfs'
2005-07-20T11:19:00.000Z	delire	m411iq	bah that won't work. you can't grep against fdisk
2005-07-20T11:19:00.000Z	delire	m411iq	just 'fdisk -l
2005-07-20T11:19:00.000Z	delire	m411iq	and then give the appropriate line.
