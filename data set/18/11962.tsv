2009-05-02T23:55:00.000Z	Linuz2009		heard that linux is diffcult for hackers to crack
2009-05-02T23:56:00.000Z	Linuz2009		but there's still at least some viruses that linux weren't immune to right?
2009-05-02T23:56:00.000Z	Linuz2009		you mean linux had no virus period?
2009-05-02T23:57:00.000Z	Linuz2009		just 2?
2009-05-02T23:58:00.000Z	Linuz2009		oh, would anyone of you tell me whats a good password?
2009-05-02T23:58:00.000Z	Linuz2009		Ubuntu, 9.04
2009-05-02T23:59:00.000Z	Linuz2009		what if I forgot the password?
2009-05-03T00:00:00.000Z	Linuz2009		yeah that's a good password but i want something thats I can remember.
2009-05-03T00:00:00.000Z	Linuz2009		like a event or phrase.
2009-05-03T00:01:00.000Z	Linuz2009		how?
2009-05-03T00:01:00.000Z	bobstro	Linuz2009	 a phase phrase is good too -- a long(ish) sentence that you can remember but mostly random.
2009-05-03T00:02:00.000Z	bobstro	Linuz2009	 the important thing is that you can remember it. within that, as random or non-dictionary worded as possible.
2009-05-03T00:03:00.000Z	bobstro	Linuz2009	 if it's so complex you have to write it down, you've defated yourself.
2009-05-03T00:03:00.000Z	bobstro	Linuz2009	 i think i had to for cups to work from the web page. but yes, you rarely need it.
2009-05-03T00:04:00.000Z	bobstro	Linuz2009	 with direct access to the machine, without encrypted drive, yes.
2009-05-03T00:04:00.000Z	bobstro	Linuz2009	 but then again, if i can walk up to your pc, i can steal it anyhow.
2009-05-03T00:08:00.000Z	bobstro	Linuz2009	 well of course. that's nothing new for any os.
2009-05-03T00:11:00.000Z	bobstro	Linuz2009	 do you lock your doors?
