2006-08-17T12:19:00.000Z	mchawla_		Kindly Help : I am having problems accessing wireless with my laptop. Everything is fine. The card is detected. Even the access point and hte network is detected. Just that it either doesn't get assigned an IP address by the DHCP server or if it is assigned(rarely), it still keeps dropping packets and all and hence I am not even able to ping any website
