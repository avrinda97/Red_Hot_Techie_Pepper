2011-04-06T11:52:00.000Z	et_		Any pointers?
2011-04-06T11:52:00.000Z	et_		I can't find out where my gdm configuration file exists on Ubuntu Lucid
2011-04-06T11:53:00.000Z	et_		kimmen: Thanks. But I don't seem to find it there
2011-04-06T11:54:00.000Z	et_		kimmen: I was looking for something named gdm.conf or custom.conf or defaults.conf
2011-04-06T11:54:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	et_	should be there? are you running gdm?
2011-04-06T11:54:00.000Z	et_	noisewaterphd	yes I am.
2011-04-06T11:55:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	et_	silly question, but you never know
2011-04-06T11:55:00.000Z	et_	noisewaterphd	I installed gdm on a server. Idea is to create a stripped down kiosk running only FF
2011-04-06T11:56:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	et_	have you looked at lubuntu
2011-04-06T11:57:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	et_	ya i can think of a few possibly better options, but i didnt want to spit them out on this channel
2011-04-06T11:57:00.000Z	et_	noisewaterphd	Yes. I even tried something minimal with slim and all.. I am pretty novice and could get anything working =)
2011-04-06T11:58:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	et_	suse has a website that lets you pick and choose only the exact features you need, then it compiles together a custom iso for you
2011-04-06T11:58:00.000Z	noisewaterphd	et_	ill try to find the url for you, its very cool
2011-04-06T11:58:00.000Z	et_	noisewaterphd	Suse.. WIll try.
