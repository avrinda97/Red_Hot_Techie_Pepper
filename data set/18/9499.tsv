2007-03-29T16:48:00.000Z	thesilentw		k_dallas, well, basically, i installed ubuntu on vmware virtual machine, so i would mess anuthing up, but i started to get a error on the bootloader with a MBR error, so i installed win xp on another partition to try and fix it
2007-03-29T16:48:00.000Z	plb	thesilentw	why not just install ubuntu on a seperate partition?
2007-03-29T16:49:00.000Z	thesilentw	plb	first on virtual machine, so i would mess anything up xD

2007-03-29T16:51:00.000Z	thesilentw	plb	btw, the live cd i have, on load, when ubuntu shows those small icons loading, (after login with user on normal install), it gets totally distorted, like a broken printer, with lots of lines, and i cant really read anything further, and it crashs
