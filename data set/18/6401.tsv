2008-05-18T02:24:00.000Z	douye	paulcross	its firefox 3.0 beta 5, right ?
2008-05-18T02:24:00.000Z	paulcross	douye	Yes
2008-05-18T02:25:00.000Z	douye	paulcross	think its a bug in firefox it self tbh, dont got probs with it when i run firefox 2.0.0.14 or something but FF 3 beta 5 seems to crash rather often (especially with flash related sites)
2008-05-18T02:27:00.000Z	paulcross	douye	Most crashs  happend when I were closing a tab.
2008-05-18T02:27:00.000Z	douye	paulcross	hmm weird, my crashes were mostly when i wanted to watch a movie on like youtube
2008-05-18T02:30:00.000Z	paulcross	douye	Is there a log or somthing, I can check the error message from.
2008-05-18T02:32:00.000Z	douye	paulcross	hmm gotta check on that, will try to get a answer for you soon :P
2008-05-18T02:32:00.000Z	paulcross	douye	:|
2008-05-18T02:36:00.000Z	paulcross	douye	If I run firefox from terminal. all I can get is "Segmentation fault"
2008-05-18T02:36:00.000Z	paulcross	douye	That's really no use.
2008-05-18T02:39:00.000Z	douye	paulcross	seems they made it rather hard to see what went wrong to cause FF crash with hardy and FF 3.0 :<
2008-05-18T02:40:00.000Z	douye	paulcross	but if you really wanna see the reason of the crash this site explains how to get the details: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MozillaTeam/Bugs  , its about on the middle of the page
2008-05-18T02:41:00.000Z	paulcross	douye	I think its fatal.  There is no cure for Segmentation fault. Its had been there for years. Only way to solve is not using C language anymore.
2008-05-18T02:42:00.000Z	douye	paulcross	:/ but your FF just crashes when you close a tab ? or when you got a certain site open or.. ?
2008-05-18T02:46:00.000Z	paulcross	douye	It could happend at any site.
2008-05-18T02:47:00.000Z	douye	paulcross	hmm then or its one of the plugins you use, or you might wanna try reinstalling firefox if you havent already, as i aint getting that crash
2008-05-18T02:48:00.000Z	paulcross	douye	Is it safe to remove firefox?
2008-05-18T02:48:00.000Z	douye	paulcross	yeah you can just remove it and reinstall it, you will mostlikely loose your plugins tho
