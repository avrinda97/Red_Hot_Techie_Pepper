2006-12-12T16:54:00.000Z	klotho		so I'm trying to install ubuntu 6.10 on an IBM T23, and it keeps freezing during the install
2006-12-12T16:54:00.000Z	klotho		is there a way to do text mode install? I can't see one.
2006-12-12T16:54:00.000Z	klotho		oh
2006-12-12T16:54:00.000Z	klotho		is this a known problem with live cd?
2006-12-12T16:55:00.000Z	klotho		it doesn't freeze, but the install stops responding after a few screens.
2006-12-12T16:55:00.000Z	klotho		6.10
2006-12-12T16:55:00.000Z	klotho		desktop
2006-12-12T16:55:00.000Z	twosouls82	klotho	what processor and mem?
2006-12-12T16:58:00.000Z	twosouls82	klotho	should do, propably another hardware problem, tried switching VCs on hangup?
2006-12-12T17:00:00.000Z	twosouls82	klotho	desktop = live + installable --> alternate = 'proper' installer
2006-12-12T17:44:00.000Z	twosouls82	klotho	use aptitude/synaptic and query to find out
2006-12-12T17:44:00.000Z	klotho	twosouls82	what's aptitude?
2006-12-12T17:45:00.000Z	twosouls82	klotho	a nice installer (for on the commandline), you will need to install it first (sudo apt-get install aptitude)
2006-12-12T17:49:00.000Z	twosouls82	klotho	opensource ;)
2006-12-12T17:50:00.000Z	twosouls82	klotho	thus free
2006-12-12T17:50:00.000Z	klotho	twosouls82	https causes encryption to happen. encryption costs CPU cycles. CPUs that are more utilized run hotter. Running hotter burns electricity. Therefore using https costs money.
2006-12-12T17:51:00.000Z	twosouls82	klotho	never compile yourself then :\
2006-12-12T17:54:00.000Z	klotho	twosouls82	the way I know this is, I like a quiet system. So I have a fan with a manual speed control and keep it turned down. I also have a temperature monitor.
