2007-07-23T15:52:00.000Z	tetonca	psnel	 try 'cat /proc/mounts' then try 'mount' to compare.
2007-07-23T05:13:00.000Z	tetonca	psnel	that's probably not possible to do.
2007-07-23T05:13:00.000Z	psnel	tetonca	why not?
2007-07-23T05:14:00.000Z	psnel	tetonca	using knoppix.. old partitions seem ok
2007-07-23T05:14:00.000Z	tetonca	psnel	didn't the setup tell you it was irrevocable?
2007-07-23T05:14:00.000Z	tetonca	psnel	oh. my bad.
2007-07-23T05:15:00.000Z	tetonca	psnel	you might tell grub 'init=/bin/sh' to get a root shell.
2007-07-23T05:15:00.000Z	psnel	tetonca	dusing  upgr, when asked about which drives/parts to inlcude in RAID, I typed "none"... it's still trying to configure RAID at bootup, then fails
2007-07-23T05:16:00.000Z	psnel	tetonca	is that necessary? knoppix gives me shell... i just need to configure now. can you help?
2007-07-23T05:16:00.000Z	tetonca	psnel	no experience specific to that problem on my side.  The more info you provide the more likely someone can help.
2007-07-23T05:19:00.000Z	psnel	tetonca	i get err during boot (after upgrade): "madm: no devices listed in conf file were found"
2007-07-23T05:20:00.000Z	psnel	tetonca	"Failure: failed to assemble all arrays"
2007-07-23T05:20:00.000Z	tetonca	psnel	can you just reinstall from scratch?  Or boot from knoppix and transfer the files to another drive?
2007-07-23T05:22:00.000Z	psnel	tetonca	i suppose thats possible. I can access the files. also DL'ing Feisty image at the mo' ... but I'd prefer if I can slove withour reinstall
2007-07-23T05:22:00.000Z	tetonca	psnel	there may be a more elegant way but I'm unfamiliar with it.
2007-07-23T05:24:00.000Z	psnel	tetonca	thanks I'll keep asking... is there maybe another support channel that could help?
2007-07-23T05:25:00.000Z	psnel	tetonca	thanks
2007-07-23T05:25:00.000Z	tetonca	psnel	maybe a Linux mailing list comp.os.linux.*
