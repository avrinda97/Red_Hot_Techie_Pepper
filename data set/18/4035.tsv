2009-06-11T12:15:00.000Z	v3s4		quick question: I want my /dev/sda1 to be mount at /boot and my /dev/sda2 to be mounted at / . Which of those partition must be marked as bootable?
2009-06-11T12:15:00.000Z	FeasibilityStudy	v3s4	the /boot obviously
2009-06-11T12:16:00.000Z	v3s4	FeasibilityStudy	obviously? grub will be on /dev/sda's MBR. Why should it matter?
2009-06-11T12:17:00.000Z	FeasibilityStudy	v3s4	the MBR has nothing to do with where you mount partitions
2009-06-11T12:19:00.000Z	v3s4	FeasibilityStudy	but GRUB does. BIOS reads and load MBR, where GRUB lives. Grub kicks in and loads whatever stated in menu.cfg. So why should the partition "boot" flag matter?
2009-06-11T12:19:00.000Z	FeasibilityStudy	v3s4	what exactlty is your question?
2009-06-11T12:21:00.000Z	v3s4	FeasibilityStudy	why should the partition mounted as /boot be flagged as "boot"  and not the partition mounted at / considering that GRUB is installed properly
2009-06-11T12:21:00.000Z	FeasibilityStudy	v3s4	because the /boot partition is where the kernel image is stored..Without it, you cant boot
2009-06-11T12:22:00.000Z	v3s4	FeasibilityStudy	unless a bootloader exists, right?
2009-06-11T12:22:00.000Z	v3s4	FeasibilityStudy	then the bootloader knows what to boot from where with total disregard of partition flags....
2009-06-11T12:23:00.000Z	v3s4	FeasibilityStudy	though I could be wrong on top of a little bit obnoxious though
2009-06-11T12:24:00.000Z	v3s4	FeasibilityStudy	then the partition "boot" flash should not matter.
2009-06-11T12:24:00.000Z	v3s4	FeasibilityStudy	if that is the case then the partition "boot" flash should not matter.
2009-06-11T12:24:00.000Z	v3s4	FeasibilityStudy	if that is the case then the partition "boot" flag should not matter.
2009-06-11T12:25:00.000Z	FeasibilityStudy	v3s4	Ubuntu should take care of boot flags and all of that for you.
2009-06-11T12:26:00.000Z	FeasibilityStudy	v3s4	just mount the /boot partition on the drive you want and the / to the other.  But I am not sure why in the world you want a whole drive dedicated to the tiny /boot partition
2009-06-11T12:28:00.000Z	v3s4	FeasibilityStudy	I want my /dev/sda1 to be mount at /boot and my /dev/sda2 to be mounted at / .  Same disk, Ok, there is also an unused /dev/sda3 but that's being reserver for 9.10
2009-06-11T12:28:00.000Z	FeasibilityStudy	v3s4	ok, I read it wrong then..
