2005-04-17T12:56:00.000Z	dcraven	Em`Zee	is there something in /etc/cron.hourly that is giving you grief?
2005-04-17T13:06:00.000Z	dcraven	Em`Zee	ahh.
2005-04-17T13:06:00.000Z	dcraven	Em`Zee	don't type uptime :)
2005-04-17T13:07:00.000Z	dcraven	Em`Zee	I have no idea what that could be.
2005-04-17T13:11:00.000Z	dcraven	Em`Zee	vimdiff /boot/config-2.6.10* /boot/config-2.6.8*
2005-04-17T13:14:00.000Z	dcraven	Em`Zee	haha
2005-04-17T13:18:00.000Z	dcraven	Em`Zee	the CONFIG_LOCK_KERNEL option is in Code Maturity Level options.
2005-04-17T13:20:00.000Z	dcraven	Em`Zee	I kinda doubt it's relevent since it is defaulted to y in the stock kern.
2005-04-17T13:21:00.000Z	dcraven	Em`Zee	hmm.. That is the only one of the 3 options not there in menuconfig.
2005-04-17T13:25:00.000Z	dcraven	Em`Zee	this is probably already established somewhere here, but are you using stock?
2005-04-17T13:26:00.000Z	dcraven	Em`Zee	you did a make oldconfig?
2005-04-17T13:27:00.000Z	dcraven	Em`Zee	then you took that and b0rked :)
2005-04-17T13:30:00.000Z	dcraven	Em`Zee	I want that shirt.
2005-04-17T13:47:00.000Z	dcraven	Em`Zee	that's whacked.
2005-04-17T13:47:00.000Z	dcraven	Em`Zee	the system bell beeps thrice?
2005-04-17T13:50:00.000Z	dcraven	Em`Zee	no... Google doesn't help either. You didn't play in BIOS recently did you?
2005-04-17T13:51:00.000Z	dcraven	Em`Zee	you in X?
2005-04-17T13:51:00.000Z	dcraven	Em`Zee	does it lock without X running? Doesn't sound much like an X problem, but what the hell...
