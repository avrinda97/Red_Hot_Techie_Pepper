2008-03-04T02:38:00.000Z	fbc	Veinor	awesome!!! that's it!  thanks,}
2008-03-04T02:40:00.000Z	Veinor		Can anyone help me to get suspend and/or hibernate working on my hp pavilion dv9235nr with Gutsy?
2008-03-04T02:40:00.000Z	Veinor		actually, a file in the recycle bin is still there until you empty it under ~/.Trash I think
2008-03-04T02:40:00.000Z	fbc	Veinor	It's probably going to be a graphics card issue...
2008-03-04T02:40:00.000Z	fbc	Veinor	Had same problem with my hp.
2008-03-04T02:41:00.000Z	fbc	Veinor	There is some parameter you need to change in the a config file for your graphics card so that your screen is not black when you come out of suspend or resume.
2008-03-04T02:41:00.000Z	Veinor	fbc	Did you manage to solve them?
2008-03-04T02:42:00.000Z	Veinor		It's not going into a suspend/resume at all
2008-03-04T02:42:00.000Z	Veinor		*suspend/hibernate
2008-03-04T02:42:00.000Z	fbc	Veinor	ahhh...  then that was not the problem I had..sry..
2008-03-04T02:42:00.000Z	Veinor		well, what was the file?
2008-03-04T02:43:00.000Z	fbc	Veinor	can't recall..however I remember it was the ati section in the X config file.
2008-03-04T02:44:00.000Z	fbc	Veinor	 There was a line that you had to toggle from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0.
2008-03-04T02:44:00.000Z	Veinor		all right
2008-03-04T02:44:00.000Z	fbc	Veinor	 So that the unit would come out of hibernation or suspend properly
2008-03-04T02:46:00.000Z	fbc	Veinor	 This should point you in the right direction. http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-181442.html
