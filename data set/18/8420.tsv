2008-08-12T10:05:00.000Z	Flynsarmy		Why is 43megs of my swap memory being used if i have 70% of my RAM free?
2008-08-12T10:06:00.000Z	Flynsarmy		pawalls, install rar and unrar
2008-08-12T10:06:00.000Z	Flynsarmy		pawalls, then from terminal: unrar <file> or right click - extract from GUI
2008-08-12T10:07:00.000Z	IdleOne	Flynsarmy	if I understand the use of swap correctly. files are placed there for faster access
2008-08-12T10:08:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	IdleOne	isn't swap done on the hard drive rather than RAM? wouldn't that be slower?
2008-08-12T10:08:00.000Z	IdleOne	Flynsarmy	well to a certain extent yeah it might be a little slower then putting them on ram but if everything gets sent to ram for faster access you would soon run out of ram
2008-08-27T17:44:00.000Z	IdleOne	Flynsarmy	try lspci in terminal
2008-08-27T17:46:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	IdleOne	I said human-readable :P
2008-08-27T17:46:00.000Z	IdleOne	Flynsarmy	that lists your hardware by name how much more human-readable do you wantr
2008-08-27T17:46:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	IdleOne	One that lists by type
2008-08-27T17:47:00.000Z	IdleOne	Flynsarmy	thee is a GUI not sure what it is called. check in System>Admin>    see what is in there
2008-08-27T17:49:00.000Z	IdleOne	Flynsarmy	I might be wrong. I don't see anything like you are looking for
2008-08-27T17:49:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	IdleOne	It's not perfect, but gnome-device-manage ris nice :) thanks
2008-08-27T17:50:00.000Z	IdleOne	Flynsarmy	there you go .
2008-08-27T17:54:00.000Z	IdleOne	Flynsarmy	you installed kubuntu-desktop?
2008-08-27T17:55:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	IdleOne	I'm running gnome
2008-08-27T17:55:00.000Z	IdleOne	Flynsarmy	or you installed some kde app and it brought in a ton of kde stuff with it
2008-08-27T17:56:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	IdleOne	That would be likely. i use k3b
