2007-11-17T02:50:00.000Z	nickrud	erUSUL	I've wondered about that factoid, doesn't a modprobe update overwrite that, or miss out on a needed change if it's been edited?
2007-11-17T02:51:00.000Z	erUSUL	nickrud	maybe you are right i do not use blaclist myself...
2007-12-14T05:12:00.000Z	nickrud	erUSUL	it didn't show in apt, base is another critter. But I expected to see it, since it's good for very old hardware
2007-12-24T03:44:00.000Z	nickrud	erUSUL	that factoid is out of date now ...
2007-12-24T03:44:00.000Z	erUSUL	nickrud	it must be edited then...
