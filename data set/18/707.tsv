2012-07-02T22:43:00.000Z	Hetep		it's weird as well, the desktop environment returned to classic environment without the icons on the side posteri the video card installation
2012-07-02T22:43:00.000Z	Hetep		have rebooted a few times trying to get the icons on the side back (Gnome 3.0 environment maybe), though without any fortune respectively
2012-07-02T22:44:00.000Z	Galvatron	Hetep	What card? Have you installed the latest proprietary drivers (form AMD/NV)?
2012-07-02T22:44:00.000Z	Hetep	Galvatron	it is the Geforce GT620 card, & have not installed any drivers yet for lack of knowing
2012-07-02T22:46:00.000Z	Galvatron	Hetep	"sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates && sudo apt-get  update && sudo apt-get upgrade" - it will give you the latest stable drivers from nVidia.
2012-07-02T22:47:00.000Z	Galvatron	Hetep	Of course you will have to reboot (not just restart X).
2012-07-02T22:51:00.000Z	Galvatron	Hetep	Only if you already have the nvidia-current package installed
2012-07-02T23:00:00.000Z	Hetep	Galvatron	fairly certain the recent nvidia drivers were not installed
2012-07-02T23:07:00.000Z	Hetep	Galvatron	help, the display is left of center, though aside from that, perfect!
2012-07-02T23:08:00.000Z	Hetep	Galvatron	muchos gracias for your assistance
2012-07-02T23:08:00.000Z	Galvatron	Hetep	Open the NV panel
2012-07-02T23:13:00.000Z	Hetep	Galvatron	then what?
2012-07-02T23:13:00.000Z	Galvatron	Hetep	Adjust the settings
2012-07-02T23:15:00.000Z	Galvatron	Hetep	Primarily the resolution and refresh rate. You must use "Save to X configuration file" to save them permanently.
2012-07-02T23:18:00.000Z	Hetep	Galvatron	how to save them to X configuration file?
2012-07-02T23:19:00.000Z	Galvatron	Hetep	There's a button for it, whrere you change the resolution and refresh rate.
2012-07-02T23:19:00.000Z	Hetep	Galvatron	yes, gracias. Just making certain since it gave a "browse" option
2012-07-02T23:21:00.000Z	Galvatron	Hetep	You might want to run "sudo nvidia-xconfig" prior to doing any changes in the panel (you must disable X to do it).
