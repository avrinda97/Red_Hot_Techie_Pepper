2011-05-21T17:35:00.000Z	yeats	MonkeyDust	have you defined the directories you're sharing in /etc/exports on the NFS server?
2011-05-21T17:35:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	yeats	yes
2011-05-21T17:35:00.000Z	yeats	MonkeyDust	and you restarted nfs-kernel-server after doing so?
2011-05-21T17:36:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	yeats	yes
2011-05-21T17:36:00.000Z	yeats	MonkeyDust	and you've defined the remote directories in /etc/fstab on the client(s)?
2011-05-21T17:37:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	yeats	it says: Neither 'subtree_check' or 'no_subtree_check' specified for export
2011-05-21T17:37:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	yeats	fstab, too, yes
2011-05-21T17:38:00.000Z	yeats	MonkeyDust	ah, have you tried adding 'no_subtree_check' to the options in /etc/exports?
2011-05-21T17:38:00.000Z	yeats	MonkeyDust	example from mine: "#/fileshare 192.168.1.0/24(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)
