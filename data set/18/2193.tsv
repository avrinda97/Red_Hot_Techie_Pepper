2010-08-01T01:40:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	ResQue	http://www.gnupg.org/signature_key.en.html
2010-08-01T01:41:00.000Z	ResQue	ilovefairuz	thank you, how did you find it, so i know for next time?
2010-08-01T01:41:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	ResQue	two clicks on the website ?
2010-08-01T01:43:00.000Z	ResQue	ilovefairuz	i see, guess i just missed the link, what link did you click on the homepage first?
2010-08-01T01:44:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	ResQue	click on "integrity check" and then in "using gpg" there's a link for "signing key" but it's kinda ambiguous
2010-08-01T01:46:00.000Z	ResQue	ilovefairuz	i see, yes i even read that page to get started and missed it, guess it kind of defeats the point getting the key from the same site you download from but i am only testing it
2010-08-01T01:46:00.000Z	ResQue	ilovefairuz	thanks
