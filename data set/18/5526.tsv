2010-11-21T04:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xiamx	then you changed your hostname in /etc/hostname but not in /etc/hosts    so you will need to use root recovery mode to get ustuck
2010-11-21T04:35:00.000Z	xiamx	ActionParsnip	how do i get to root recovery mode
2010-11-21T04:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xiamx	hold shift at boot, select recovery mode, select root
2010-11-21T04:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xiamx	you can mount the partition and chroot, or if you are file editting you can do it without chroot
2010-11-21T05:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xiamx	sure, http://pastebin.com/ZfMmFjCr
2010-11-21T05:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xiamx	the file is generated by grub, I suggest you boot to liveCD, chroot to the installed OS and fix
2012-07-31T04:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xiamx	sudo dmidecode | less     may say
2012-07-31T04:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	xiamx	or show you the motherboard make / model so you can maybe find out. You can always go into the BIOS
2012-07-31T04:06:00.000Z	xiamx	ActionParsnip	thanks, got it from dmidecode
