2007-12-27T03:58:00.000Z	jamescarr		is there a chan for linux mint?
2007-12-27T03:58:00.000Z	Slart	jamescarr	yes.. it might be rather sleepy though
2007-12-27T04:11:00.000Z	Slart	jamescarr	hmm..  hang on.. let me check
2007-12-27T04:10:00.000Z	Slart	jamescarr	sudo apt-get remove packagename?
2007-12-27T04:13:00.000Z	Slart	jamescarr	I'm pretty sure there is a switch or something you can use to make apt-get make a clean start.. can't find it now though
2009-05-20T03:03:00.000Z	jamescarr	Slart	sorry.. I'm desperate
2009-05-20T03:04:00.000Z	Slart	jamescarr	if you really want help you have to give us information about your system.. right now you could be running ubuntu 3.1 on an old VAX machine and a hand crank for power
2009-05-20T03:04:00.000Z	Slart	jamescarr	for all we know
2009-05-20T03:05:00.000Z	Slart	jamescarr	what version of ubuntu..32bit or 64bit, server or desktop (or something else)
2009-05-20T03:06:00.000Z	Slart	jamescarr	wait wait.. put it all on ONE line..
2009-05-20T03:06:00.000Z	Slart	jamescarr	describe your problem, include your versions and computer info.. all in one line.. adding a "please" might also help
2009-05-20T03:07:00.000Z	Slart	jamescarr	external mouse? or some kind of laptop mouse substitute
2009-05-20T03:07:00.000Z	Slart	jamescarr	if you boot from a live cd, do you get the same problems?
2009-05-20T03:08:00.000Z	jamescarr	Slart	hard to say... sometimes it happens in 30 minutes, sometimes it happens after 5 hours
2009-05-20T03:08:00.000Z	jamescarr	Slart	to be frank, if I put a liveCD in, I probably won't see it
2009-05-20T03:09:00.000Z	Slart	jamescarr	have a look at the file /var/log/syslog  .. find the time of the latest instance when you had the problem.. do you see anything in the log around that time? anything that looks like "fatal error, keyboard going bananas"
2009-05-20T03:10:00.000Z	jamescarr	Slart	ah ha! It says  on like 58 "FATAL: keyboard going bananas"
2009-05-20T03:10:00.000Z	Slart	jamescarr	wonderful =).. you can pastebin the syslog from around that time.. that way we can see it too
