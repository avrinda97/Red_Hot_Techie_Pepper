2007-02-28T13:57:00.000Z	ian__		hi.  i've installed ubuntu 6.06 LTS on my laptop, when I try to install my WinXP driver for wireless with ndiswrapper, I get - "couldn't copy /ian/Temp/neti2220.inf at /usr/sbin/ndiswrapper line 135.".  how do i fix this?
2007-02-28T13:58:00.000Z	Answer	ian__	are you doing something obscure that requires ndiswrapper?  I haven't needed it for anything wireless
2007-02-28T13:59:00.000Z	ian__	Answer	no, i don't think so.  needed to install ndiswrapper with suse on my laptop too.
2007-02-28T14:00:00.000Z	Answer	ian__	6.06 should be able to do almost any normal wireless thing you want without ndiswrapper
2007-02-28T14:01:00.000Z	ian__	Answer	you mean my wireless card is supported in 6.06?
2007-02-28T14:02:00.000Z	Answer	ian__	sure what kind is it?  I have never had to use ndiswrapper I think it's just a headache
2007-02-28T14:02:00.000Z	ian__	Answer	I've always had to use. my card is a cisco one... ipn2220 or something
2007-02-28T14:03:00.000Z	Answer	ian__	is your card in now?  you should be able to see it with ifconfig -a
2007-02-28T14:03:00.000Z	ian__	Answer	not on my laptop now, but can check.  back in a min.
2007-02-28T14:09:00.000Z	ian__	Answer	ifconfig -a shows an eth0, lo, and a sit0
2007-02-28T14:10:00.000Z	Answer	ian__	does dmesg show your card?
2007-02-28T14:13:00.000Z	ian__	Answer	no.
2007-02-28T14:13:00.000Z	ian__	Answer	(dmesg does not show my card)
2007-02-28T14:13:00.000Z	Answer	ian__	ok then I guess you have a special card.  I have used cisco lmc352 and cb21ag without ndiswrapper
2007-02-28T14:14:00.000Z	ian__	Answer	ok.  I have always had to use ndiswrapper.  so, why isn't it installing?
2007-02-28T14:17:00.000Z	ian__	Answer	it is not a cisco card, it is an INPROCOMM.
2007-02-28T14:17:00.000Z	Answer	ian__	sorry never heard of it
2007-02-28T14:18:00.000Z	ian__	Answer	ok. i will check out the docs. thanks.
