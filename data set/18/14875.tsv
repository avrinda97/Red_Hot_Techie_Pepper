2005-11-09T06:00:00.000Z	concept10		anyone running firefox 1.5 RC1 yet?
2005-11-09T06:00:00.000Z	dooglus	concept10	I am
2005-11-09T06:01:00.000Z	dooglus	concept10	haven't had a crash yet, which is more than I can say for the beta
2005-11-09T06:01:00.000Z	concept10	dooglus	I hate that the old firefox starts when I launch a app, did you change the sensible browser pref?
2005-11-09T06:02:00.000Z	dooglus	concept10	what do you mean?  I don't see the old one any more
2005-11-09T06:02:00.000Z	concept10	dooglus	thunderbird still launches the old version, I should just remove the deb
2005-11-09T06:03:00.000Z	dooglus	concept10	I put "export BROWSER=~/programs/firefox/firefox" in my ~/.bash_profile, and ". ~/.bash_profile" in my ~/.gnomerc
2005-11-09T06:03:00.000Z	dooglus	concept10	the BROWSER variable is used to tell apps which browser to use
2005-11-09T06:03:00.000Z	dooglus	concept10	arrange for it to be set automatically, and you'll be fine
2005-11-09T06:04:00.000Z	concept10	dooglus	okay, thanks for the tip
2005-11-09T06:06:00.000Z	concept10	dooglus	its stable for me, i just needed to change that.
2005-11-09T06:07:00.000Z	concept10	dooglus	what about flock?
2005-11-09T06:09:00.000Z	dooglus	concept10	I didn't try flock.  when I first saw it, it was closed source, so I left it alone.  i heard that it's since become open source but I've not looked
2005-11-09T06:10:00.000Z	concept10	dooglus	it was always OSS, it was closed because of beta
2005-11-09T06:10:00.000Z	dooglus	concept10	I'm not sure about that.
2006-02-22T13:48:00.000Z	dooglus	concept10	dapper doesn't work with xubuntu-desktop at all at the moment
2006-02-22T13:49:00.000Z	concept10	dooglus	whats the issue? basically im trying to find out what major components have been changed, i will judge wether i should upgrade with that
2006-02-22T13:49:00.000Z	dooglus	concept10	xubuntu-desktop: Depends: xfdesktop4 but it is not going to be installed
