2010-10-07T22:38:00.000Z	Quantum_Ion	ganeshran	I would always recommend a back hard drive and use rsync to back up all your important ubuntu files
2010-10-07T22:38:00.000Z	ganeshran	Quantum_Ion	I back up all my data regulary :)
2010-10-07T22:39:00.000Z	Quantum_Ion	ganeshran	lol yeah but most new users of computer operating systems don't
2010-10-07T22:42:00.000Z	Quantum_Ion	ganeshran	true the internet is not as fast as it should be
2010-10-07T22:43:00.000Z	Quantum_Ion	ganeshran	In this crazy economy they charge a lot for telcom services nowadays blah !
2010-10-07T22:44:00.000Z	Quantum_Ion	ganeshran	If you live in America they want you to pay top dollar for every service really
2010-10-07T22:45:00.000Z	ganeshran	Quantum_Ion	Yup.. but bandwidth in the developed world is still cheaper than the developing world :(
2010-10-07T22:45:00.000Z	Quantum_Ion	ganeshran	okay where are you from India ?
2010-10-07T22:45:00.000Z	ganeshran	Quantum_Ion	yup
2010-10-07T22:46:00.000Z	Quantum_Ion	ganeshran	I would think India and China had the highest speed internet networks nowadays since most of the global economy is operating out of Asia
2010-10-07T22:47:00.000Z	ganeshran	Quantum_Ion	Nah. Corporate offices have wonderful connections. Fibre. very reliable. But home internet penetration is still less and so is bandwidth
2010-10-07T22:47:00.000Z	Quantum_Ion	ganeshran	okay I understand
