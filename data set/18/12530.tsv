2012-08-22T00:40:00.000Z	aarcane		any one know of any MAJOR issues with having ubuntu installed to a USB drive instead of a hard drive?  it's for permanent deployment in a single system.
2012-08-22T00:40:00.000Z	Debolaz	aarcane	Depends on the type of USB drive.
2012-08-22T00:41:00.000Z	Debolaz	aarcane	If we are talking a proper SSD with a USB interface, there aren't any problems, performance will be just fine.
2012-08-22T00:41:00.000Z	Debolaz	aarcane	If you are thinking of a USB stick type device, you will have high latency for reads/writes, though bandwidth should be fine.
2012-08-22T00:41:00.000Z	aarcane	Debolaz	I'm looking at kingston TD drives
2012-08-22T00:41:00.000Z	aarcane		*DT
2012-08-22T00:42:00.000Z	Debolaz	aarcane	Could you link to it?

2012-08-22T00:42:00.000Z	aarcane	Debolaz	I want to mount them on an internal USB header and boot them in a raid1 configuration
2012-08-22T00:43:00.000Z	Debolaz	aarcane	Latency is going to be your problem. Ie, it's going to take significantly longer from a read request from the OS is issued, till the data has returned, compared to a normal harddrive. RAID will not change this.
2012-08-22T00:43:00.000Z	aarcane	Debolaz	latency is the only issue?  that just means slower load times for stuff, right?
2012-08-22T00:44:00.000Z	Debolaz	aarcane	Slower reaction when things needs to be accessed from the harddrive.
2012-08-22T00:44:00.000Z	Debolaz	aarcane	Load time will suffer as a result of that as well of course.
2012-08-22T00:44:00.000Z	aarcane		I'm looking to replace some...  poor quality "traditional" sata SSDs.  For most of what I want, everything should be loaded into RAM on first use and never unloaded.  I'm using mpd & xbmc on one system, and running a ZFS file server on another, and these crap SSDs keep losing data.
2012-08-22T00:46:00.000Z	Debolaz	aarcane	It might be somewhat expensive to get the same amount of data on USB sticks as a low grade SSD.
2012-08-22T00:46:00.000Z	aarcane	Debolaz	I'm using 8GB SSDs, and only need about 6 for any system.  I've limited myself to 8GB on purpose to make upgrades and backups easier and faster :)
2012-08-22T00:47:00.000Z	Debolaz	aarcane	Well, it works just fine to have the OS on an USB stick. But you'll just have to see if you are willing to live with the tradeoffs I've mentioned.
2012-08-22T00:49:00.000Z	aarcane	Debolaz	these drives are pretty slow.  I'll have to try it and see, I 'spose.  I'll try it on my media server first before putting it on the file server.
