2006-01-01T11:45:00.000Z	nopea		does anybody know if DHCP, NAT, DNS and other such network functions can be accessed thru Gnome (no the the shell)
2006-01-01T11:45:00.000Z	nopea		bummer
2006-01-01T11:46:00.000Z	nopea		I want to turn an old PC into a router and such - thought I would use Ubuntu - 2003 is just far to pricy for a home server deal :)
2006-01-01T11:47:00.000Z	Jeeves_moss	nopea	 go get a good "howto" on shell stuff, and lear.  its easy to set up once you know where everything is, and how it works.  Two words for ya.  TEXT FILES!!
2006-01-01T11:48:00.000Z	Jeeves_moss	nopea	 yes there is.  its another modual you install
2006-01-01T11:49:00.000Z	nopea	Jeeves_moss	thanks
2006-01-01T11:49:00.000Z	Jeeves_moss	nopea	 NP
2006-01-01T11:50:00.000Z	nopea	Jeeves_moss	do you do alot of networking?
2006-01-01T11:50:00.000Z	Jeeves_moss	nopea	 not realy.  I own a company that re-does corprate networks.  I do the hardware side of things.
2006-01-01T11:52:00.000Z	nopea	Jeeves_moss	cool - yesterday I tried this trick where I plugged my Fiber Optic modem into a hub then the old PC into the hub and connected with PPPoE thru the hub, all other PCs at home (2) connected to the hub could access the net (thru a NAT) - wondered if thats normal
2006-01-01T11:54:00.000Z	Jeeves_moss	nopea	 no, you've left your systems open.  if its a true "hub" and not a router, then ALL the systems would have to be firewalled.  not to mention you don't have any access or routing control over the ISP's connection.
2006-01-01T11:56:00.000Z	nopea	Jeeves_moss	I should be more clear - I have the old PC connected to my ISP with PPoE - which goes from the NIC on the old PC to the hub, then to the fiber modem.  The PPPoE dialer has a firewall on it.  The other PCs connect to the old PC (server) via the hub, and all Internet requests go thru the NAT on the old PC (server).  Sorry if that makes no sense ;-)
2006-01-01T11:57:00.000Z	Jeeves_moss	nopea	 yea, that sounds better.  I've got 9 systems running through an old 450Mhz system thats running a firewall.
2006-01-01T11:59:00.000Z	nopea	Jeeves_moss	cool - I was unsure about the fact the PPPoE goes thru the same NIC and hub that the other PCs go to.  But in the end the PPPoE dialer/client gets its own IP and Subnet from the ISP's DHCP server
2006-01-01T11:59:00.000Z	nopea	Jeeves_moss	smart man! :-)
2006-01-01T12:01:00.000Z	Jeeves_moss	nopea	 as long as your ISP's nic has its own IP (non internal to your network), and you have your internal network on a differn't subnet, then you should be fine.  The NAT preforms the netowrk hop (to the differen't subnet), so in theroy, if the "router" gets hacked, it'll take a while to get over to the other netowrk.  you need to make sure that if the router is compermised that its a "fail open" network connection.
2006-01-01T12:02:00.000Z	Jeeves_moss	nopea	rabbit:  good night guys.  I'm going to hop into bed.  my Fiance is calling.  <evil grin>
2006-01-01T12:02:00.000Z	nopea	Jeeves_moss	take care
