2010-04-08T22:48:00.000Z	Keg_		anyone have any experience in methods of cloning a mounted drive?
2010-04-08T22:48:00.000Z	Keg_		using dd, preferably
2010-04-08T22:49:00.000Z	psusi	Keg_	what do you mean?  and no, you don't want to use dd
2010-04-08T22:49:00.000Z	Keg_	psusi	I have five PC's that can't boot from externals... and I want to clone the heavily customized ubuntu acreoss them
2010-04-08T22:50:00.000Z	psusi	Keg_	if you want to create a backup image of your drive, you want something like partimage, or g4l which uses it... which you can find on the parted magic livecd
2010-04-08T22:51:00.000Z	psusi	Keg_	then how do you propose to boot?
2010-04-08T22:51:00.000Z	Keg_	psusi	my idea is to somehow clone the customised one onto the other one using my external bay
2010-04-08T22:51:00.000Z	psusi	Keg_	yea... and how are you goign to do that if it has no bootable os and no way to boot from external media?
2010-04-08T22:52:00.000Z	psusi	Keg_	does the machine have a usb port?  you could boot from a usb stick
2010-04-08T22:52:00.000Z	psusi	Keg_	flash that is
2010-04-08T22:53:00.000Z	Keg_	psusi	tried, but the BIOS seems to be not working for booting from a USB.... I originally tried using remastersys to make a distro, but these damned things just do NOT want to boot from external media
2010-04-08T22:54:00.000Z	psusi	Keg_	what IS it booting from then?  if it can't boot from anything but the internal disk, which has no os, then you can't install an os.. chicken and egg problem...
2010-04-08T22:54:00.000Z	Keg_	psusi	they're FIT-PC2's, and they came with Ubuntu 9.10 installed. I suppose I may be better off just trying to make a shell script to do all my customization...
2010-04-08T22:55:00.000Z	psusi	Keg_	then they plugged the disk into another machine to load it first... maybe you could do the same then?
2010-04-08T22:56:00.000Z	Keg_	psusi	I'm trying to do this all free... I'm going to try remastersys again, and see if i can get it to boot from a USB
2010-04-08T22:57:00.000Z	psusi	Keg_	you have a desktop right?  pull the disk out of this other machine and plug it into yuor desktop... create a partimage from the disk you have set up, then plug in the other disk and dump the image back
2010-04-08T23:05:00.000Z	Keg_	psusi	looks like remastersys might be exactly what I'm looking for... I just found another forum post telling how to get the BIOS to boot from a USB thumb drive
2010-04-09T00:17:00.000Z	Keg_	psusi	turns out there was a BIOS update
