2007-12-15T12:20:00.000Z	kthakore_		I am having touble with my hal, it fails to initialized ( I get a popup on login saying so) and now I can't use my dvdroms and my usb sticks, ipod and other usb stuff
2007-12-15T12:21:00.000Z	kthakore_		what to do
2007-12-15T12:21:00.000Z	Cubexombi	kthakore_	did you disable something from your System -> Pref ->session?session
2007-12-15T12:22:00.000Z	kthakore_	Cubexombi	don't hink so I will check
2007-12-15T12:23:00.000Z	kthakore_	Cubexombi	no everything is on but bluetooth and I don't have bluetooth
2007-12-15T12:23:00.000Z	Cubexombi	kthakore_	For me Disabling blue tooth did it. you can disable it totally by installing sysv-rc-conf I can find a how to for you if you need it
2007-12-15T12:24:00.000Z	kthakore_	Cubexombi	disabling bluetooth killed ur hal?
2007-12-15T12:24:00.000Z	kthakore_	Cubexombi	will it hurt if I leave it on?
2007-12-15T12:24:00.000Z	Cubexombi	kthakore_	in short there's still a daemon running that wants to find the applet, thats why HAL is crashing..
2007-12-15T12:25:00.000Z	Cubexombi	kthakore_	 nah won't hurt you, may just eat a few ms out of sturt up but thats all
2007-12-15T12:26:00.000Z	kthakore_	Cubexombi	then how do I remove it cuz I have a server on here I neede
2007-12-15T12:28:00.000Z	kthakore_	Cubexombi	I will log out and back in with bluethooth on
2007-12-15T12:28:00.000Z	Cubexombi	kthakore_	 if you want to disable it completely you can "sudo apt-get install sysv-rc-conf" then "sudo sysv-rc-conf" in terminal, from there just scroll to the bluetooth section,

2007-12-15T12:33:00.000Z	kthakore_	Cubexombi	awesome
2007-12-15T12:34:00.000Z	Cubexombi	kthakore_	 no problem, I cut my boot time down to about 45s using this.
