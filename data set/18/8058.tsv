2008-06-20T15:54:00.000Z	hfmls		how do i aplly themes now ?
2008-06-20T15:55:00.000Z	WalloO	hfmls	for me, with hardy, emerald doesn't work for an unknown reason. Instead, I instal metacity themes, and it works
2008-06-20T15:56:00.000Z	WalloO	hfmls	go here for some theme: http://gnome-look.org/index.php?xcontentmode=101&PHPSESSID=dbffcee6a07cdef0f85a886903c0f173
2008-06-20T15:56:00.000Z	hfmls	WalloO	 but after i had the theme to emerald
2008-06-20T15:58:00.000Z	WalloO	hfmls	usually, after puting your theme in emerald, clicking on the theme displayed should enable it. For me, with hardy, it doesn't work, it's why I recommand using metacity theme, and install it using "appearance" soft.
2008-06-20T16:00:00.000Z	WalloO	hfmls	unfortunately, it seems there are less good theme than for emerald.
2008-06-20T16:02:00.000Z	WalloO	hfmls	I don't know, it worked perfectly for me with 7.10 and with 8.04, it doesn't work. ho yes, one time, the theme appeared but never after... So I don't know. Maybe there are to theme managers fighting, and emerald loose most of the time.
2008-06-20T16:03:00.000Z	WalloO	hfmls	usualy, you have to run compiz with an option like compiz-real --replace emerald and then it may work
2008-06-20T16:15:00.000Z	WalloO	hfmls	just remove the bottom bar, then right click on the top bar and "add to panel"
2008-06-20T16:16:00.000Z	WalloO	hfmls	you can add all properties from the bottom bar to the top one like that
2008-06-20T16:44:00.000Z	WalloO	hfmls	it is still not working?
2008-06-20T16:45:00.000Z	WalloO	hfmls	thank you for your help, I forgot a parameter, now emerald work for me... :)
2008-06-20T16:47:00.000Z	WalloO	hfmls	emerald will just change the bar at the top of your windows... that's it, no more.
2008-06-20T16:48:00.000Z	WalloO	hfmls	for the rest, you have to find the software for system information by yourself.... :)
2008-06-20T16:50:00.000Z	WalloO	hfmls	for gtk theme, it's menu->preferences->appearaence, then click on on the button to add theme, then select your gtk theme (the tar.gz file). Then, it will ask you to enable it or not. If it doesn't ask you, go in customize, and select it.
2008-06-20T16:52:00.000Z	WalloO	hfmls	I know it can be confusing... but ubuntu is simple, so think simple... ubuntu and gnome will do the job for you... :)
