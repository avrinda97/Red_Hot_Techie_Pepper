2008-08-16T17:30:00.000Z	maho		I am having problems with the Startup-Manager app if someone has time to help me with it
2008-08-16T17:32:00.000Z	maho		fair enough. when I try to add a new usplash in startup-manager, it just closes. no error, no prompt to point to the new usplash I want to import. I tried uninstalling it and reinstalling it but it doesnt change
2008-08-16T17:33:00.000Z	debCarlos	maho	Already tried with sudo aptitude remove --purge package && sudo aptitude install package     ?
2008-08-16T17:39:00.000Z	maho	debCarlos	I did ask you recommended, but I get the same issue. when I try to run startupmanager from terminal, I get a "segmentation fault" before the app crashes
2008-08-16T17:40:00.000Z	debCarlos	maho	seg fault ??? weird... maybe you can search in launchpad for a bug related to it.... because seg fault is something, err... a bug in system or in the app
2008-08-16T17:41:00.000Z	maho	debCarlos	thats where I looked before I hopped in here. I have found errors of it not running at all, but nothing about it crashing with trying to add an .so file
