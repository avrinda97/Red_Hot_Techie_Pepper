2005-12-24T12:02:00.000Z	Paradoxx		sigh... why is it that Firefox + flash + linux = poo
2005-12-24T12:03:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Paradoxx	I have flash working in FF1.5
2005-12-24T12:03:00.000Z	Paradoxx	tonyyarusso	how did you get 1.5? been waiting for it in universe for the longest while
2005-12-24T12:04:00.000Z	Paradoxx	tonyyarusso	you installed it yourslef?>
2005-12-24T12:05:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Paradoxx	Direct from getfirefox.com; it won't show up in universe - backports if anything, otherwise for an Ubuntu build you have to wait for Dapper.
2005-12-24T12:05:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Paradoxx	yeah, I did the install.
2005-12-24T12:05:00.000Z	Paradoxx	tonyyarusso	i hear that aswell. Why they waiting till daper to release it?
2005-12-24T12:06:00.000Z	Paradoxx	tonyyarusso	i'm probably gonna try out daper beginning of jan...
2005-12-24T12:07:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Paradoxx	Ubuntu's policy is to release each stable version with what's available at the time, and focus on including new things after that into the next release.  Other developers are then free to make build for the previous stable during that period if they wish, hence backports.
2005-12-24T12:08:00.000Z	Paradoxx	tonyyarusso	yea, so when we gettin it on backports?
2005-12-24T12:12:00.000Z	Paradoxx	tonyyarusso	kk, thx much
2005-12-24T12:15:00.000Z	Paradoxx	tonyyarusso	have you experienced any problems installing FF that way?
2005-12-24T12:15:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Paradoxx	It took me a bit to figure out plugins.
2005-12-24T12:16:00.000Z	Paradoxx	tonyyarusso	how much faster than default FF is it? cause that is why i would b upgrading
2005-12-24T12:17:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Paradoxx	When I was using it at school (DSL) it was fabulous.  I can't quantify it, but it was a noticable difference.  Now I'm at home for break on dialup, so it's not the limiting factor anymore.
2005-12-24T12:18:00.000Z	Paradoxx	tonyyarusso	what about loading times etc, in terms of actualy app, is it any different?
2005-12-24T12:19:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Paradoxx	Yeah, I'd say it is different.
2005-12-24T12:20:00.000Z	Paradoxx	tonyyarusso	kk, thx much
