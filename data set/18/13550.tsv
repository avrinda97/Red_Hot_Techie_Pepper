2005-11-04T13:47:00.000Z	ATIProblem	shutdownrunner	mhm... i need to install newest ati driver, you can help me or not?
2005-11-04T14:00:00.000Z	shutdownrunner	ATIProblem	why would you need to install drivers outside of repository? the latest drivers are already in rep
2005-11-04T14:01:00.000Z	ATIProblem	shutdownrunner	yeah right... repos :D apt-get install blablabla, is that installation method good? or that one in the forum better? btw. sry for my english :]

2005-11-04T14:02:00.000Z	shutdownrunner	ATIProblem	installing drivers from website is good in case drivers in rep are outdated
2005-11-04T14:02:00.000Z	shutdownrunner	ATIProblem	you have to install linux-restricted-[version of your kernel] 
2005-11-04T14:03:00.000Z	ATIProblem	shutdownrunner	emm... maybe u can help install drivers? i hawe fresh ubuntu linux 5.10, installed about ~30minutes ago... :] 
2005-11-04T14:07:00.000Z	shutdownrunner	ATIProblem	you have to install xorg-driver-fglrx, linux-restricted-modules-[version of your kernel]  and then edit xorg.conf
2005-11-04T14:09:00.000Z	ATIProblem	shutdownrunner	?? omg, it's like apt-get install xorg-driver-fglrx, then apt-get install linux-restricted-modules-[version of your kernel]  and then edit xorg.conf? that is workin` for ya?
2005-11-04T14:10:00.000Z	shutdownrunner	ATIProblem	[version of your kernel]  means you have to check the version of your kernel. type uname -r in terminal
2005-11-04T14:11:00.000Z	ATIProblem	shutdownrunner	last question... what i need to do in xorg.conf?
2005-11-04T14:12:00.000Z	shutdownrunner	ATIProblem	well, you have to either edit xorg.conf or use as root fglrxconfig
2005-11-04T14:14:00.000Z	ATIProblem	shutdownrunner	apt-get install xorg-driver-fglrx, apt-get install linux-restricted-modules-2.6.12-9-386, sudo fglrxconfig, restart and wola...?
