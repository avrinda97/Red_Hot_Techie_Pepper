2010-06-23T07:44:00.000Z	Joshua_Roberts		why when I start Ubuntu do I have no sound, yet the audio settings are not muted.  I have to use the audio management app to mute and then unmute the sound for it to work.  This happens every time I restart/logout->login
2010-06-23T07:46:00.000Z	Joshua_Roberts		can anyone help me with the sound issue?  sound does not work at start up unless I mute and unmute the sound.
2010-06-23T07:46:00.000Z	Joshua_Roberts		10.04
2010-06-23T07:47:00.000Z	Joshua_Roberts		thanks
2010-06-23T07:48:00.000Z	Joshua_Roberts		I am really impressed with openbox... it really adds some extra umph to my old laptop.  almost makes it seem like it is a newer one...  :D
2010-06-23T07:49:00.000Z	Joshua_Roberts		anyone know how to restore a minimized window when using openbox without a taskbar?
2010-06-23T07:50:00.000Z	MTecknology	Joshua_Roberts	Alt+Tab
2010-06-23T07:51:00.000Z	MTecknology	Joshua_Roberts	it's that easy?
2010-06-23T07:54:00.000Z	Joshua_Roberts	MTecknology	It is really neat.  I may not go back to gnome once I learn enough xml to edit the menu, main files that openbox uses to organize everyting.
2010-06-23T07:54:00.000Z	MTecknology	Joshua_Roberts	obconf obmenu
2010-06-23T07:56:00.000Z	Joshua_Roberts	MTecknology	yeah I know, but obconf still lacks some features, like I can't edit the location of the window control buttons and such through obconf, I have to still use xml.
2010-06-23T07:56:00.000Z	MTecknology	Joshua_Roberts	yes you can - check it out again
2010-06-23T08:01:00.000Z	Joshua_Roberts	MTecknology	I still don't see where I can edit the titleLayout in obconf.  I guess I am not using it correctly
2010-06-23T08:02:00.000Z	Joshua_Roberts	MTecknology	ah found it
2010-06-23T08:02:00.000Z	MTecknology	Joshua_Roberts	:)
2010-06-23T08:27:00.000Z	Joshua_Roberts	MTecknology	does obconf let me set key bindings too?  or is that still something I have to do manually?
2010-06-23T08:27:00.000Z	MTecknology	Joshua_Roberts	i think that's a manual thing
2010-06-23T08:27:00.000Z	MTecknology	Joshua_Roberts	an easy one at least :)
