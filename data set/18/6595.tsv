2008-04-26T16:33:00.000Z	materthron		hey guys! why does " sudo echo "blacklist intel_rng" >> /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist" give me a permission denied error?
2008-04-26T16:33:00.000Z	zeno	materthron	add a sudo to the front
2008-04-26T16:34:00.000Z	materthron	zeno	I already did
2008-04-26T16:34:00.000Z	zeno	materthron	maybe intel_rng or /we is running?
2008-04-26T16:35:00.000Z	zeno	materthron	try rmmod intel_w/e
2008-04-26T16:36:00.000Z	materthron	zeno	 "lsmod | grep intel" just yields sound stuff
2008-04-26T16:36:00.000Z	zeno	materthron	sorry i dunno :( maybe try it as root?
2008-04-26T16:37:00.000Z	materthron	zeno	root under ubuntu? isn't this replaced by sudo?
2008-04-26T16:37:00.000Z	zeno	materthron	you can still use root by 1.passwd 2.su ; and i THINK its the same but not sure
2008-04-26T16:39:00.000Z	materthron	zeno	may intel_agp cause this error?
2008-04-26T16:40:00.000Z	zeno	materthron	im not sure, theres a thread at http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=712479
2008-04-26T16:41:00.000Z	materthron	zeno	this is unrelated to my problem as i'm using 8.04
2008-04-26T16:42:00.000Z	zeno	materthron	try post 35
2008-04-26T16:43:00.000Z	materthron	zeno	i've got an ati and i'm using the restricted driver
2008-04-26T16:44:00.000Z	zeno	materthron	ver  173.08?
2008-04-26T16:45:00.000Z	materthron	zeno	how do i find that out?
2008-04-26T16:46:00.000Z	zeno	materthron	try the version referenced in post 35
2008-04-26T16:47:00.000Z	materthron	zeno	i'm using an ati, not an nvidia. the post you're refering to is for nvidia
