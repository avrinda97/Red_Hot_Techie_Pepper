2012-07-27T20:41:00.000Z	indigoferal	whoever	where is your keyboard icon
2012-07-27T20:41:00.000Z	whoever	indigoferal	taskbar by the clock
2012-07-27T20:42:00.000Z	indigoferal	whoever	if its on the tool bar , just rightl click on it and say quit
2012-07-27T20:42:00.000Z	indigoferal		i mean remove
2012-07-27T20:43:00.000Z	indigoferal		what DE are you using - most have a way of enabling panel options / disabling of apps inside the panel
2012-07-27T20:43:00.000Z	whoever	indigoferal	i tried that and there isn't a quit option just my layouts, show keymap, and show keyboard options
2012-07-27T20:44:00.000Z	indigoferal		yes, am seeing that - just a sec will tell you how
2012-07-27T20:44:00.000Z	whoever	indigoferal	and there is not an option to not show the icon under options
2012-07-27T20:45:00.000Z	whoever	indigoferal	it is 12.04 if that matters for any reason
2012-07-27T20:46:00.000Z	indigoferal		no which Desktop environment - Cinnamon, mate, kde xfce etx, yes it matters because each have a diffeent way of managing the panel
2012-07-27T20:47:00.000Z	indigoferal		Go to cinnamon settings there you will find the option to turn keyboard off
2012-07-27T20:47:00.000Z	indigoferal		Cinnamon settings - applets
2012-07-27T20:48:00.000Z	whoever	indigoferal	gnome unity
2012-07-27T20:48:00.000Z	indigoferal		oops ?
