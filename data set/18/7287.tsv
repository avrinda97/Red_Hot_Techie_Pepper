2010-12-19T09:03:00.000Z	Fezzler		Any guitar players here?  What is the best, most compatible A/D capture device for Ubuntu?
2010-12-19T09:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Fezzler	there is no best app for anything
2010-12-19T09:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Fezzler	just take the output from your amp and whack it into the audio ni, you can then use something like audacious
2010-12-19T09:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Fezzler	i dont record, i just play but it's how I would. If you want low latency I'd install th rt kernel
2011-01-31T06:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Fezzler	remove the driver, reboot, then reinstall it
2011-01-31T06:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Fezzler	not sure, never bothered with it. Shouldn't as far as I am aware
2011-01-31T06:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Fezzler	I'm guessing you do a lot of sound production...
2011-01-31T06:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Fezzler	df -h
2012-05-29T05:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Fezzler	not really, you just choose the session at login
2012-05-29T05:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Fezzler	a terminal command
2012-05-29T06:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Fezzler	use the cog icon near your username
2012-05-29T06:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Fezzler	you select the lxde session in thelogin screen, you use the cog near your username
2012-05-29T06:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Fezzler	not the cog on the desktop
2012-05-30T06:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Fezzler	you can use LXDE in 12.04
2012-05-30T06:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Fezzler	later drivers, newer kernel etc
2012-05-30T06:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Fezzler	if it ain't broke, don't fix it :)
2012-05-30T06:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Fezzler	could wait for it to die then clean install / upgrade to Precise :)
2012-05-30T06:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Fezzler	I would too :)
