2007-08-25T14:06:00.000Z	bjames		that sounds about right
2007-08-25T14:06:00.000Z	bjames		core voltage most probably
2007-08-25T14:07:00.000Z	bjames		does nobody in here know how to fullscreen a window?
2007-08-25T14:07:00.000Z	bjames		I feel stupid for asking, but it seems no-one knows
2007-08-25T14:07:00.000Z	bjames		:S
2007-08-25T14:08:00.000Z	bjames		is metacity the gnome default?
2007-08-25T14:08:00.000Z	bjames		no, I don't want to MAXIMISE, nor do I want an application to hide some of it's toolbars
2007-08-25T14:09:00.000Z	bjames		F11 just puts firefox into a "minimal menus" mode
2007-08-25T14:09:00.000Z	bjames		you may have missed my original question...
2007-08-25T14:10:00.000Z	bjames		I've just installed VirtualBox (VM), but the guest OS doesn't fit in the window so I want to fullscreen it
2007-08-25T14:10:00.000Z	wailer	bjames	fullscreen a window??
2007-08-25T14:12:00.000Z	wailer	bjames	spilling over the edges suggests that the monitor has settins that aren't right - there are buttons on the front for that
2007-08-25T14:12:00.000Z	bjames	wailer	no, you don't understand me
2007-08-25T14:13:00.000Z	wailer	bjames	I'm patient
2007-08-25T14:13:00.000Z	wailer	bjames	try again with different words
2007-08-25T14:16:00.000Z	wailer	bjames	sorry - apart from the dishes linux does all that I need - don't need no other OS
2007-08-25T14:16:00.000Z	bjames	wailer	a VM doesn't just have to be used to run other OSes
2007-08-25T14:17:00.000Z	wailer	bjames	I have no need so I haven't explored - sorry
