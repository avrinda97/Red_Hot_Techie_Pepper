2011-04-01T02:39:00.000Z	antant		Hey guys. Can anyone tell me what package I need to install to get   /usr/lib/libc.a     ?
2011-04-01T02:40:00.000Z	antant		why thank you!
2011-04-01T02:40:00.000Z	antant		except I just installed that
2011-04-01T02:41:00.000Z	antant		well you say very fantastic. It seems to have lied
2011-04-01T02:43:00.000Z	wrd	antant	what is the problem?
2011-04-01T02:44:00.000Z	antant	wrd	Not finding /usr/lib/libc.a and I've just installed libc6-dev
2011-04-01T02:44:00.000Z	wrd	antant	why do you need libc.a ?
2011-04-01T02:47:00.000Z	wrd	antant	but libc.a is a static library? i suppose you are rather looking for an so file?
2011-04-01T02:47:00.000Z	antant	wrd	well it told me I'm missing /usr/lib/libc.a
2011-04-01T02:53:00.000Z	wrd	antant	what on earth is that project? it does use some weird build makefile, that runs apt-get and some weird shell skripts????
2011-04-01T02:54:00.000Z	antant	wrd	Uses lots and lots of shell scripts. Doesn't apt-get though
2011-04-01T02:55:00.000Z	wrd	antant	where do you want to deploy that thing? it does probably query the apt database for various build tools (i.e. build-essential etc.)
2011-04-01T02:56:00.000Z	antant	wrd	installed that. It's basically a vastly slimmed down XBMC Live. Boots on my htpc in about 13/14 secs from cold
2011-04-01T02:59:00.000Z	wrd	antant	if it's already deployed why do you want to compile it again? do you know what command does query libc.a ? (does it exist on your computer that file in particular?) and why the hell does it link libc.a statically instead of building it's own version of libc ????
2011-04-01T03:00:00.000Z	antant	wrd	I'm building a custom version
2011-04-01T03:04:00.000Z	wrd	antant	using the system libc to compile a binary for another kernel is a _very_ bad idea. i guess you need to adapt the build system and you defo should be able to install libc.a its either in libc6-dev or in libc6
2011-04-01T03:05:00.000Z	wrd	antant	why should clone fail? you may be on the wrong branch?
2011-04-01T03:06:00.000Z	antant	wrd	shouldn't be. On the one I'cve always been
