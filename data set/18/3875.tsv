2009-07-13T17:45:00.000Z	amuridi		How well does wpa2 plays with Ubuntu?
2009-07-13T17:45:00.000Z	icebaer	amuridi	got it running without problems so far
2009-07-13T17:46:00.000Z	amuridi	icebaer	/ kaini  I see, thanks!
2009-07-13T17:46:00.000Z	icebaer	amuridi	your welcome
2009-07-13T17:46:00.000Z	icebaer	amuridi	you're welcome (bit rusty with english ;) )
2009-07-13T17:47:00.000Z	icebaer	amuridi	it should work right out of the box, AFAIK
2009-07-13T17:49:00.000Z	icebaer	amuridi	you can forward the x-server to your box
2009-07-13T17:49:00.000Z	icebaer	amuridi	probably easier than with ssh
2009-07-13T17:50:00.000Z	icebaer	amuridi	and your settings might be overriden by network-manager anyways.
2009-07-13T17:51:00.000Z	icebaer	amuridi	well, is his box GUI-less or not?
2009-07-13T17:52:00.000Z	amuridi	icebaer	gnome.
2009-07-13T17:53:00.000Z	icebaer	amuridi	Then you should try to use the network-manager through the gui then. I believe that your cli-settings will be overriden by it anyways.
2009-07-13T17:53:00.000Z	icebaer	amuridi	just forward the x-session to your box through ssh.
2009-07-13T17:55:00.000Z	amuridi	icebaer	thanks.
2009-07-13T17:55:00.000Z	icebaer	amuridi	your welcome
2009-07-13T17:56:00.000Z	amuridi	icebaer	what tool do you use for that? .. xstart?
2009-07-13T17:56:00.000Z	icebaer	amuridi	startx, but you'll have to set some settings first, since the forwarding will be disabled by default.
2009-07-13T17:56:00.000Z	icebaer	amuridi	you'll have to edit /etc/ssh/sshd_config first
