2007-04-30T05:58:00.000Z	zeroday	kaolti	what gfx card and issue?
2007-04-30T06:00:00.000Z	kaolti	zeroday	i have fx 5500 and my question is if i should dl drivers from nvidia.com to get better performance
2007-04-30T06:00:00.000Z	kaolti	zeroday	i just installed ubuntu and the card seems to  go ok
2007-04-30T06:01:00.000Z	zeroday	kaolti	i have some card and i used the envy script for the best performance
2007-04-30T06:01:00.000Z	zeroday	kaolti	but im not sure
2007-04-30T06:01:00.000Z	zeroday	kaolti	i would stick with the drivers ubuntu gave you
2007-04-30T06:02:00.000Z	zeroday	kaolti	you can search for options to speed up your card though on google
2007-04-30T06:02:00.000Z	kaolti	zeroday	how come some opengl screensavers for example have very low fps
2007-04-30T06:02:00.000Z	kaolti	zeroday	the card should handle them easily
2007-04-30T06:03:00.000Z	zeroday	kaolti	i dunno if you really want to you can install the ACTUAL drivers from nvidia easily with the envy script
2007-04-30T06:03:00.000Z	zeroday	kaolti	i disabled the screensavers
2007-04-30T06:04:00.000Z	kaolti	zeroday	ok thanks for the help :)
2007-04-30T06:04:00.000Z	zeroday	kaolti	np
