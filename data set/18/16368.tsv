2004-10-15T06:05:00.000Z	cybernout		okey , lets go over this step by step..
2004-10-15T06:06:00.000Z	cybernout		if i wanto open an root console - it will prompt for the passwd
2004-10-15T06:06:00.000Z	cybernout		right?
2004-10-15T06:06:00.000Z	cybernout		why not?
2004-10-15T06:07:00.000Z	Treenaks	cybernout	you want to run some commands as root. you almost never want a complete root console.
2004-10-17T10:42:00.000Z	Treenaks	cybernout	welcome
2004-10-17T10:42:00.000Z	Treenaks	cybernout	no.
2004-10-17T10:43:00.000Z	Treenaks	cybernout	there's no KDE because there wasn't enought time to customize/stabilize _two_ desktop environments
2004-10-17T10:43:00.000Z	Treenaks	cybernout	and because a lot of Ubuntu developers are GNOME people, Gnome was chosen
2004-10-17T10:43:00.000Z	Treenaks	cybernout	the next version will probably give you more of a choice
2004-10-17T10:43:00.000Z	Treenaks	cybernout	though I think KDE is in the 'universe' repositoryt
2004-10-17T10:44:00.000Z	Treenaks	cybernout	you can install it, it's just not supported for this version
