2004-10-27T14:18:00.000Z	Skif		jools: pretty much all *dm variants work that way
2004-10-27T14:18:00.000Z	Skif		er, joolz, that was
2004-10-27T14:18:00.000Z	Skif		gdm, kdm, xdm, whateverdm
2004-10-27T14:19:00.000Z	Skif		the best *dm is the one that doesn't crash when you try to run it :-P
2004-10-27T14:20:00.000Z	Skif		stop that crap right now, or I will rant about H.R.Puffenstuf :P
2004-10-27T14:20:00.000Z	Skif		o_O;; er, okay
2004-10-27T14:21:00.000Z	Skif		one of the nice things about appalachia was, no crack
2004-10-27T14:21:00.000Z	Skif		except for the occasional plumber
2004-10-27T14:23:00.000Z	Skif		or "libfoo-dev"
2004-10-27T14:23:00.000Z	Skif		for example, configure sez, "guile not found", you usually need guile and libguile-dev
2004-10-27T14:24:00.000Z	|trey|	Skif	usually a lot easier to resolve such things with "auto-apt"  :/
2004-10-27T14:24:00.000Z	|trey|	Skif	I recommend checking it out  :)
2004-10-27T14:36:00.000Z	|trey|	Skif	bah
2004-10-27T14:50:00.000Z	|trey|	Skif	I would rather apps go in /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin... that way its for everyone  :/
2004-10-27T15:08:00.000Z	|trey|	Skif	yes, yes it is  ;)
2004-11-15T11:40:00.000Z	|trey|	Skif	I find ctrl+l useful... that pretty much takes care of all the problems I had at first with it  :)
2004-11-15T11:44:00.000Z	Skif	|trey|	me, too; I tried at first, and I just end saying 'bah' and going to a shell anyway
2004-11-15T11:44:00.000Z	|trey|	Skif	I just don't like clicking that much... I don't want to move my arm, its comfortable  :(
