2008-11-19T15:55:00.000Z	olskolirc		hey guys, what do us linux ppl use to build flash pages like macromedia mx or swish?
2008-11-19T15:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	olskolirc	ktoon can do it apparently, theres also a cli tool that makes swf files from animated gifs
2010-03-07T06:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	olskolirc	what video card?
2010-03-07T06:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	olskolirc	sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx-96   i think (if you use karmic)
2010-06-14T00:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	olskolirc	yes
2010-06-14T01:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	olskolirc	affecting what?
2010-06-14T01:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	olskolirc	yes it affects linux users, the 64bit plugin in the recommended repo is still 10.0 but as long as you keep to reputable pages you will be fine
2010-06-26T10:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	olskolirc	there are also addons for various browser which let you too
2010-08-23T06:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	olskolirc	use the universal installer in windows to transfer the iso to usb
2010-08-23T06:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	olskolirc	you dont just copy the iso to the device, its needs transferring in a special way
2010-08-23T06:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	olskolirc	if you have a windows PC then pendrivelinux have a universal ISO copier, Ubuntu has usb-creator-gtk  which can transfer the iso over so it is bootable
2010-08-29T12:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	olskolirc	maybe somewhere in $HOME/.mozilla or /var/log
2010-09-15T12:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	olskolirc	not used kde for years now. The guys in #kubuntu will see them daily
2010-10-06T11:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	olskolirc	doesn't matter, maverick is offtopic here
2011-01-19T03:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	olskolirc	there seems to be a command antiword which converts word files to text
2011-01-19T03:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	olskolirc	antiword filename.txt > /tmp/out.txt; less /tmp/out.txt; rm /tmp/out.txt
2011-05-05T22:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	olskolirc	maybe a ppa
2011-06-02T23:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	olskolirc	usually they figure themselves out. If you made an xorg.conf file, it is located in /etc/X11
