2012-04-01T22:49:00.000Z	ikonia	scut	it's that simple
2012-04-01T22:50:00.000Z	scut	ikonia	ssh@hostname ?
2012-04-01T22:50:00.000Z	scut	ikonia	or ip ?
2012-04-01T22:50:00.000Z	scut	ikonia	well that doesn't matter...it seems i cant see my laptop
2012-04-01T22:50:00.000Z	ikonia	scut	if you have dns sshuser @hostname, if not ssh user@ip
2012-04-01T22:52:00.000Z	ikonia	scut	on your laptop please do "ssh localhost"
2012-04-01T22:52:00.000Z	ikonia	scut	do you get a connection ?

2012-04-01T22:53:00.000Z	scut	ikonia	that was the correct question :D...it works now..i missed that
2012-04-01T22:54:00.000Z	ikonia	scut	great, well done
2012-04-01T23:12:00.000Z	scut	ikonia	lol my connection has just died
2012-04-01T23:12:00.000Z	scut	ikonia	i mean...i get timeout now
2012-04-01T23:13:00.000Z	scut	ikonia	and also there is a huge latency
2012-04-01T23:13:00.000Z	ikonia	scut	sounds like your network performance is poor
