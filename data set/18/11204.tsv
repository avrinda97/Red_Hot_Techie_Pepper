2006-09-11T14:21:00.000Z	icema1	Jack_Sparrow	in bios yes, but linux still installs reguardless of the bios settings, so I have to install to the Onboard video, then reconfigure and install the nvidia driver, but the howto fro the nv driver did not work.

2006-09-11T14:30:00.000Z	nozorro	icema1	if you want the nvidia instead of the intel driver, insert 'nvidia' in "Device" Section (remove "i810"). Disable the BusID line for now
