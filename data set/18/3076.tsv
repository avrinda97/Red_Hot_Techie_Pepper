2010-07-01T07:26:00.000Z	cannonfodder		hey u guys
2010-07-01T07:26:00.000Z	cannonfodder		ayone here know hwo to use SSH?
2010-07-01T07:27:00.000Z	cannonfodder		ssh is so failing me right now
2010-07-01T07:27:00.000Z	cannonfodder		it doesnt like the syntax im using to try login to a friend computer
2010-07-01T07:27:00.000Z	cannonfodder		basically those are fake numbers
2010-07-01T07:28:00.000Z	cannonfodder		i just want the syntax
2010-07-01T07:28:00.000Z	cannonfodder		im trying to ssh into an ip address at a certain port
2010-07-01T07:28:00.000Z	codebrainz	cannonfodder	try   ssh -p 400 user@123.123.123.123
2010-07-01T07:27:00.000Z	codebrainz	cannonfodder	in which way?
2010-07-01T07:27:00.000Z	cannonfodder	codebrainz	  im trying to ssh into a computer   i try  "ssh  user@123.123.123.123:400"
2010-07-01T07:28:00.000Z	codebrainz	cannonfodder	more importantly what test34 said :)
2010-07-01T07:34:00.000Z	codebrainz	cannonfodder	is the remote computer still up?
2010-07-01T07:35:00.000Z	codebrainz	cannonfodder	init.d  that was to be my suggestion
2010-07-01T07:36:00.000Z	codebrainz	cannonfodder	heh
2010-07-01T07:37:00.000Z	cannonfodder	codebrainz	  "ssh -p 3454 noob123@76.168.34.45"   btw this is fake info..but this the syntax im using...after i type that and hit enter nothing happens  it doesnt show anythign happening
2010-07-01T07:38:00.000Z	codebrainz	cannonfodder	not sure, if it asked for the password before, i dunno, unless it's "offline"
2010-07-01T07:39:00.000Z	codebrainz	cannonfodder	google for 'ssh known_hosts' and such, you might need to clear some junk out (not ssh expert)
2010-07-10T09:16:00.000Z	codebrainz	cannonfodder	nohup maybe
