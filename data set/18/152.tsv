2012-07-20T19:13:00.000Z	plain-person		I upgraded from the software center thingie that pops up with updates. I upgraded from Narwhal all the way to 12.04
2012-07-20T19:14:00.000Z	L3top	plain-person	does sudo aplay -l    return a result?
2012-07-20T19:18:00.000Z	plain-person	L3top	I get two entries of HDA Intel (analog and digital)
2012-07-20T19:23:00.000Z	L3top	plain-person	when you open alsamixer... which is selected by default? (press f6 to see options)
2012-07-20T19:24:00.000Z	plain-person	L3top	It appears (- default, and 0 HDA Intel)
2012-07-20T19:28:00.000Z	L3top	plain-person	is this an analog connection (to speakers) and is anything muted in alsamixer?
2012-07-20T19:31:00.000Z	plain-person	L3top	Sorry, L3top, I don't really understand your question.
2012-07-20T19:34:00.000Z	plain-person	L3top	The laptop uses in-built speakers, and occasionally I plug some external speakers to it.
2012-07-20T19:36:00.000Z	plain-person	L3top	If I login with my regular account, I get no sound at all, and no sound device appears in volume control. If I log in with a different account (this one, which I have created precisely to deal with this), sound works OK, only that the inbuilt speakers keep sounding also when I plug the external ones.
2012-07-20T19:39:00.000Z	L3top	plain-person	I would like to see the output of sudo aplay -l on that other account.
2012-07-20T19:40:00.000Z	plain-person	L3top	Ahmmm... OK, I will try to get that, but I am afraid I won't be able to get to the terminal or copy the output (touchpad stops working in  20 seconds)
2012-07-20T19:41:00.000Z	L3top	plain-person	I am just curious if there is output at all... dont need it. If there is, I would expect it is the same.
2012-07-20T19:49:00.000Z	plain-person	L3top	The output of aplay -l is the same as in the other user, although it took it a little while to process the command
2012-07-20T19:52:00.000Z	L3top	plain-person	I don't know that this is a favored recommendation, but I would sudo apt-get remove pulse*; sudo apt-get install --reinstall alsa-base alsa-utils    but... that is just me. Pulse just seems to cause me all sorts of problems.
2012-07-20T19:54:00.000Z	plain-person	L3top	I would follow all recommendations. In fact, I have been a bit confused from the beginning with the whole Alsa and pulseaudio business. What are they, why do I need both, or do I?
2012-07-20T19:59:00.000Z	plain-person	L3top	In case things go wrong: would it be possible to reinstall pulse without complications?
2012-07-20T20:04:00.000Z	plain-person	L3top	While pulseaudio gets removed. Why do you think my touchpad stops working after 20 seconds logged in on the account with issues? Any idea?
2012-07-20T20:07:00.000Z	L3top	plain-person	I don't like that problem. Sounds like something might be probing it a bit too hard and it dies. Intermittent bus death is not my favorite issue.
