2011-01-29T16:54:00.000Z	ikonia	samski	don't want an image, just explain the current situation and what happened to get it there
2011-01-29T16:55:00.000Z	ikonia	samski	is the ubuntu partition still there ?
2011-01-29T16:55:00.000Z	ikonia	samski	great, I'll give you a url
2011-01-29T16:55:00.000Z	ikonia	samski	check the URL ubottu just sent you, it will walk you through re-applying grub
2011-01-29T16:56:00.000Z	ikonia	samski	what do you mean "it's still there"
2011-01-29T16:57:00.000Z	ikonia	samski	try to mount the partition from the livecd/liveusb

2011-01-29T16:58:00.000Z	ikonia	samski	I told you 3 times not to send the image, answer the question
2011-01-29T16:58:00.000Z	ikonia	samski	can you mount it
2011-01-29T16:59:00.000Z	ikonia	samski	if it is actually free space, then your partition and data is gone
2011-01-29T16:59:00.000Z	ikonia	samski	if it's not free space, mount it and confirm the data is ok
2011-01-29T17:00:00.000Z	ikonia	samski	it's gone
