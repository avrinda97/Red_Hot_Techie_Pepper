2004-12-26T14:00:00.000Z	ulisse		Hi channel!
2004-12-26T14:01:00.000Z	ulisse		I'm having a strange behaviour with gnome-menus in hoary
2004-12-26T14:01:00.000Z	ulisse		Sometimes it disappears the buttons to logoff, run apps etc...
2004-12-26T14:01:00.000Z	bestadvocate	ulisse	me too are some programs not appearing?
2004-12-26T14:02:00.000Z	bestadvocate		oh i had that problem too
2004-12-26T14:02:00.000Z	bestadvocate		i had to restart
2004-12-26T14:02:00.000Z	ulisse	bestadvocate	not programs, but basic functions
2004-12-26T14:02:00.000Z	bestadvocate		ulisse:and since the restart button was missing i had to use ctrl+alt+backspace
2004-12-26T14:03:00.000Z	ulisse		the strange is that sometimes I start Gnome regularry, the button is there, but after a while it disappear!
2004-12-26T14:03:00.000Z	bestadvocate	ulisse	did it happen right after you updated? thats the only 2 times it happened to me
2004-12-26T14:03:00.000Z	ulisse	bestadvocate	It happens since two days ago update, but happens daily...
2004-12-26T14:03:00.000Z	bestadvocate		but i just started to use hoary today last night and its happened twice to me
2004-12-26T14:04:00.000Z	ulisse		I think it could be a known issue, hoary is in developement, but I came here just to know if it was happening only to me ;)
2004-12-26T14:05:00.000Z	bestadvocate	ulisse	do you know your way around bugzilla? i think we should check it out
2004-12-26T14:06:00.000Z	ulisse	bestadvocate	I don't know how to use bugzilla, I just took a look into the forum
2004-12-26T14:06:00.000Z	bestadvocate	ulisse	i have only the vagest ideas after reading firefox bugs for fun
2004-12-26T14:07:00.000Z	bestadvocate		( i was really into that whole google-firefox conspericy theory)
2004-12-26T14:07:00.000Z	ulisse	bestadvocate	I think I'll wait and see, gnome-menus are under hard-development right now...
