2006-08-30T08:26:00.000Z	arno		Hello. Could someone test my ftp server : ftp://83.157.181.153
2006-08-30T08:28:00.000Z	frogzoo	arno	ftp doesn't respond
2006-08-30T08:29:00.000Z	arno	frogzoo	: could you try again now please?
2006-08-30T08:29:00.000Z	frogzoo	arno	no dice - it pings though
2006-08-30T08:30:00.000Z	arno	frogzoo	what do you mean?
2006-08-30T08:30:00.000Z	frogzoo	arno	I can ping the ip - but I get no ftp prompt
2006-08-30T08:31:00.000Z	frogzoo	arno	I guess you haven't got your firewall/router setup properly
2006-08-30T08:31:00.000Z	arno	frogzoo	Nickrivers i'll look
2006-08-30T08:33:00.000Z	frogzoo	arno	ip again?
2006-08-30T08:34:00.000Z	arno	frogzoo	nickrivers ftp://83.157.181.153
2006-08-30T08:34:00.000Z	frogzoo	arno	nope
2006-08-30T08:35:00.000Z	frogzoo	arno	getting ftp through a firewall can be tricky - suggest you google 'ftp firewall'
2006-08-30T08:36:00.000Z	arno	frogzoo	ubuntu I use proftpd. Can you try again now?
2006-08-30T08:37:00.000Z	frogzoo	arno	nope & this is getting old fast - read up on firewalling ftp as I say
2006-08-30T08:52:00.000Z	frogzoo	arno	nope
2006-08-30T08:52:00.000Z	arno	frogzoo	: can you still ping?
2006-08-30T08:53:00.000Z	frogzoo	arno	you can use 'shields up' or similiar to check if your ftp port is contactable, that's step #1
2006-08-30T08:53:00.000Z	frogzoo	arno	yes it pings - google 'shields up' so you can check yourself
