2008-01-07T14:01:00.000Z	MaMaGoody		hello, is it possible to hibernate to several files so I can choose the state i want to restore?
2008-01-07T14:02:00.000Z	debatem1	MaMaGoody	if you find out how to do that i would LOVE to know
2008-01-07T14:03:00.000Z	debatem1	MaMaGoody	sounds uber cool, i wonder why I never thought of that before...
2008-01-07T14:04:00.000Z	MaMaGoody	debatem1	been playing emulator and I just want the scheme for my software dev.
2008-01-07T14:05:00.000Z	debatem1	MaMaGoody	i've been looking at checkpoint n restore systems, whole nine yards, never even thought about being able to do that
2008-01-07T14:07:00.000Z	debatem1	MaMaGoody	now you're moving into my territory. CPR and teleporting
2008-01-07T14:09:00.000Z	debatem1	MaMaGoody	yes, there are technologies to do that, some of them very hard to use and some of them very easy, and most of them are conditional
2008-01-07T14:11:00.000Z	debatem1	MaMaGoody	oh, if you're deving, just use frame substitution on GDB
2008-01-07T14:11:00.000Z	MaMaGoody	debatem1	they are java games..
2008-01-07T14:12:00.000Z	debatem1	MaMaGoody	oh. damn, see, java throws a kink in the works for a lot of that stuff
2008-01-07T14:14:00.000Z	debatem1	MaMaGoody	you can use an xproxy for that
2008-01-07T14:14:00.000Z	debatem1	MaMaGoody	theres a package called xmove that was designed for teleporting, ie, moving one display to another, but it can also be used to move a window on the current display to the current display
2008-01-07T14:15:00.000Z	debatem1	MaMaGoody	also, depending on your structure, you may be able to use cryopid and then CPR the whole game structure. other techniques involving relinking code have been developed, but I don't really spend too much time with them
2008-01-07T14:17:00.000Z	MaMaGoody	debatem1	no, they are using j2me.
2008-01-07T14:19:00.000Z	MaMaGoody	debatem1	I hardly doubt that sun would do that though..
2008-01-07T14:20:00.000Z	MaMaGoody	debatem1	but I only write code in obj-c :)
2008-01-07T14:24:00.000Z	MaMaGoody	debatem1	where can i read about this cpr support in gtk thing?
2008-01-07T14:26:00.000Z	MaMaGoody	debatem1	ah, thanks.
