2011-10-29T10:53:00.000Z	erin		No just install gnome from repos and reboot then log out select gnome classic and log back in.
2011-10-29T10:53:00.000Z	erin		Not hard. Just install Win7 without key. Download RemoveWAT. Then run it.
2011-10-29T10:54:00.000Z	erin		Yes. WAT = Windows Activation Tool. Its separate software from the OS.
2011-10-29T10:54:00.000Z	erin		It is this way for IT network installs\
2011-10-29T10:55:00.000Z	erin		Hang on. Let me get there.
2011-10-29T10:56:00.000Z	erin		RHEL has gnome 2 till 2018. Trust me. 10.04 gnome will have support. Just not canonicals
2011-10-29T10:56:00.000Z	erin		Instead of just Gnome in software center. Try GMOME Shell
2011-10-29T10:57:00.000Z	erin		Whatever you say.
2011-10-29T10:57:00.000Z	erin		RHEL has backing and enough developement resources to keep it afloat.
