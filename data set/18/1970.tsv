2010-09-27T05:40:00.000Z	mamece2		amarok is the best linux have for music?
2010-09-27T05:41:00.000Z	mamece2		is there any player like winamp in ubutun?
2010-09-27T05:42:00.000Z	mattgyver	mamece2	depends on the feature set you require but VLC is really good and a minimal gui like winamp
2010-09-27T06:06:00.000Z	mamece2	mattgyver	so any change of cover i do in any program is just to see in that particular programme
2010-09-27T06:06:00.000Z	mattgyver	mamece2	yeah more or less.
2010-09-27T11:08:00.000Z	mattgyver	mamece2	Plus its built off debian unstable which is generally cutting edge, unless you wanna run unstalbe which isnt exactly simple
2010-09-27T11:13:00.000Z	mattgyver	mamece2	yeah.
2010-09-27T11:13:00.000Z	mattgyver	mamece2	did you mean kubuntu?
2010-09-27T11:15:00.000Z	mattgyver	mamece2	it can be done but its not easy at all.
2010-09-27T11:16:00.000Z	mattgyver	mamece2	yeah apparently i live in the dark and didnt know about it
2010-09-27T11:21:00.000Z	mattgyver	mamece2	probably the closest you could come is to backing up /home for application configurations and maybe /etc but /etc you might not want to fully restore
2010-09-27T11:24:00.000Z	mattgyver	mamece2	it will work willing that 1) Your Ubuntu Partition is behind your Windows Partitoin, 2) You have space left next to your Ubuntu partition
2010-09-27T11:25:00.000Z	mamece2	mattgyver	the partition of windows and ubuntu are independent
2010-09-27T11:27:00.000Z	mattgyver	mamece2	correct you just need to be sure that your partition table is not |Ubuntu | Windows | Free Space.
2010-09-27T11:33:00.000Z	mattgyver	mamece2	you still have free space at the end of your drive?
2010-09-27T11:33:00.000Z	mamece2	mattgyver	i think
2010-09-30T06:50:00.000Z	mattgyver	mamece2	sounds like you installed ubuntu to the entire drive.  You will have to resize it to free up the necessary space for bt4.
2010-09-30T07:05:00.000Z	mamece2	mattgyver	i have windows, i installed ubuntu and that made a partition for it, but when i tried to install BT4 i can edit only the new partition when it is ubuntu
