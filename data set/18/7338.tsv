2009-04-25T16:33:00.000Z	zap0		why is it so hard to download the torrent file?
2009-04-25T16:34:00.000Z	zap0		for a new linux user, my experience so far is aweful.
2009-04-25T16:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zap0	the torrent speed is relative to the seeders
2012-01-15T18:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zap0	you can change LAN IP easily, WAN IP is provided by your ISP
2012-01-15T18:24:00.000Z	zap0	ActionParsnip	thanks.  i found a dialog that let me change it.
2012-05-03T16:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zap0	what video chip?
2012-05-03T16:21:00.000Z	zap0	ActionParsnip	its running in virtualbox.      nvidia card.   8800GT i think.
2012-05-03T16:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zap0	if its a virtual stystem then it will use virtual hardware
2012-05-03T16:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zap0	did you install guest additions?
2012-05-03T16:23:00.000Z	zap0	ActionParsnip	yes.
2012-05-03T16:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zap0	could use: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=777759   just change the res to what you desire
2012-05-03T16:26:00.000Z	zap0	ActionParsnip	ok.. edit a xorg.conf    im a bit of a noob (to linux), i write software in windows, so im not stupid, just ignorant of where linux stuff is;   where do i find the  xorg.conf  file?
2012-05-03T16:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zap0	run:   gksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf     paste the text there
2012-05-03T16:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zap0	what is the virtual system for?
2012-05-03T16:27:00.000Z	zap0	ActionParsnip	i've written some apps that i test in Wine.
2012-05-03T16:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zap0	I see, I wouldn't use your full display size, use something slightly smaller
2012-05-03T16:30:00.000Z	zap0	ActionParsnip	yes.  1024x768 is a bit too small.   i want  1600 x 1024.  i also have multiple monitors ;)        there is no file  /etc/X11/xorg.conf      the command has opened an empty file
2012-05-03T16:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zap0	yes, Ubuntu doesn't ship with one, but if you make one it will be obeyed
