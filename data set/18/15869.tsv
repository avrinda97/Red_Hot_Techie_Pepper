2005-01-13T07:27:00.000Z	lnxduk_		I have like 3 floppy disks I can use.. how do I install ubuntu?
2005-01-13T07:27:00.000Z	lnxduk_		no one knows how to do it?
2005-01-13T07:28:00.000Z	lnxduk_		I did
2005-01-13T07:29:00.000Z	lnxduk_		that is a serious problem if you guys require cds...
2005-01-13T07:29:00.000Z	lnxduk_		can I netboot it?
2005-01-13T07:29:00.000Z	lnxduk_		I have a wireless laptop on the same network with fbsd
2005-01-13T07:29:00.000Z	lnxduk_		that I could boot off
2005-01-13T07:30:00.000Z	lnxduk_		basically I ran out of cd-r's
2005-01-13T07:30:00.000Z	lnxduk_		I have a cd-rw, but it fails to load vmlinuz
2005-01-13T07:30:00.000Z	lnxduk_		can I burn the iso on a dvd-r?
2005-01-13T07:31:00.000Z	siretart	lnxduk_	you could try this one: http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/hoary/main/daily-installer-i386/current/images/netboot/
2005-01-13T07:32:00.000Z	siretart	lnxduk_	or for warty, better try this one first: http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/warty/main/installer-i386/release/images/netboot/
2005-01-13T07:38:00.000Z	siretart	lnxduk_	I think that would work, but I think you should better setup a tftp server and do a network installation
2005-01-13T07:40:00.000Z	siretart	lnxduk_	http://d-i.alioth.debian.org/manual/en.i386/ch04s06.html, and the rest of the manual
2005-01-13T07:40:00.000Z	siretart	lnxduk_	ubuntu is using debian installer, so the documentation applies mostly for ubuntu too
2005-01-13T07:42:00.000Z	siretart	lnxduk_	if your network card's having problems with netbooting, create a floppy for it at http://rom-o-matic.org
2005-01-13T07:42:00.000Z	lnxduk_	siretart	ah that is a good idea, the dhcp server is a router, so it can't run tftp though
2005-01-13T07:43:00.000Z	siretart	lnxduk_	?
