2005-11-01T08:49:00.000Z	thoreauputic	point	with a fast modern drive it doesn't matter much
2005-11-01T08:50:00.000Z	point	thoreauputic	thats what i lack.
2005-11-01T08:51:00.000Z	thoreauputic	point	did you say something or is my client broken?
2005-11-01T08:51:00.000Z	point	thoreauputic	i did..
2005-11-01T08:53:00.000Z	thoreauputic	point	I changed my background colour and your posts disappeared ;-)
2005-11-01T08:53:00.000Z	thoreauputic	point	I think the old idea was that putting swap at the beginning of the drive was a good move
2005-11-01T08:54:00.000Z	point	thoreauputic	that's what i have read; wanted more insight on the idea.
2005-11-01T08:54:00.000Z	thoreauputic	point	something to do with angular velocity I seem to recall
2005-11-01T08:55:00.000Z	thoreauputic	point	I guess the beginning of the drive tends to be close to the outer edge of the disk on old disks
2005-11-01T08:56:00.000Z	point	thoreauputic	i was under the impression that it was faster, because of less space for the heads to travel
2005-11-01T08:56:00.000Z	thoreauputic	point	hmm - not sure really to be quite honest
2005-11-01T08:58:00.000Z	point	thoreauputic	a little of topic...can you recommend a decent terminal emulator, thats light on resources?
2005-11-01T08:58:00.000Z	thoreauputic	point	yes, urxvt from the rxvt-unicode package
2005-11-01T08:59:00.000Z	thoreauputic	point	or aterm - but aterm doesn't do utf8
2005-11-01T08:59:00.000Z	point	thoreauputic	great, thanks
2005-11-01T09:23:00.000Z	thoreauputic	point	ubuntu-desktop is just a metapackage
2005-11-01T09:24:00.000Z	thoreauputic	point	quite safe to remove
