2007-06-19T06:20:00.000Z	dardack		someone recommend i come on here for some help with my wireless connection, when someone has a minute
2007-06-19T06:21:00.000Z	dardack		indygunfreak: thanks for link already read it, still no help
2007-06-19T06:21:00.000Z	tovella	dardack	ask your question - ubotu is a "bot" - automated responses.
2007-06-19T06:23:00.000Z	dardack	tovella	i see, um well every so often i get dropped for like 45 to 2 minutes and than comes back up, annoying when playing games, downloading, listen to music, etc.  i have pings going to my router and google. com and can show you what happens there when it happens, also my link signal during this time doubles, once comes back it goes back to normal, um and none of the logs in /var/log are changed when it occurs
2007-06-19T06:24:00.000Z	tovella	dardack	so this isn't an issue with getting it working, it's more a question of reliability?
2007-06-19T06:24:00.000Z	dardack	tovella	yes, and its not regular intervals
2007-06-19T06:25:00.000Z	dardack	tovella	and i can't tell if it's only when i'm acutally doing something online, i've left the pings going when i'm away and when i scroll up as far as the terminal lets me i don't see any of the issue
2007-06-19T06:27:00.000Z	tovella	dardack	an intermittent problem with wi-fi connectivity (or any intermittent problem, for that matter) is always the most difficult to troubleshoot.  it's possible that there are unresolved issues with the particular hardware you're using. which wi-fi device, & model of PC are we talking about?
2007-06-19T06:28:00.000Z	dardack	tovella	the best buy brand pci wireless g, uses Arethos chipset   AR5005G 802.11abg NIC,
2007-06-19T06:31:00.000Z	tovella	dardack	have a look this site: http://nosrednaekim.wordpress.com/tag/linux/kubuntu/
2007-06-19T06:32:00.000Z	tovella	dardack	there's a part that says, "Atheros support is broken for the AR5005G in Ubuntu."
2007-06-19T06:33:00.000Z	dardack	tovella	see i've read things like that and couldn't tell if that was to even get it to work, or like my problems.  Is there a place that walks me through uninstalling the built in Arethos drivers, i've gotten ndiswrapper to work on my laptop for my belkin, but i tried here and it gave me erros, mainly i think because i haven't figured out how to remove the arethos restricted drivers
2007-06-19T06:36:00.000Z	tovella	dardack	the easiest solution might be to exchange it for a card that's known to work well with linux.
2007-06-19T06:37:00.000Z	dardack	tovella	i wish, gonna try ndiswrapper, works great on my belkin, just need to figure out how to remove the built in driver
2007-06-19T06:38:00.000Z	tovella	dardack	i'm not saying you can't get it working, but one way to end lots of frustration is to only buy from vendors who are linux friendly.
2007-06-19T06:38:00.000Z	tovella	dardack	if i had an atheros card, i could try some things to help you more.
2007-06-19T06:38:00.000Z	dardack	tovella	i know, but i read that it worked for people right out, so i got it, maybe that was earlier versions or something
2007-06-19T09:03:00.000Z	dardack	tovella	thanks for the help earlier, i had to do a fresh install to get ndiswrapper to work, but i have better signal str, and so far no drops, but we'll see as time goes on
