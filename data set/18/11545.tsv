2006-11-06T15:22:00.000Z	bilss_		I still have not upgraded  from dapper what are the advantages as i have only a mail server with minimal X
2006-11-06T15:24:00.000Z	volvoguy	bilss_	 they informed me here to stick with dapper for server duties. i just did the install.
2006-11-06T15:24:00.000Z	bilss_	volvoguy	install of dapper?
2006-11-06T15:24:00.000Z	volvoguy	bilss_	yes.
2006-11-06T15:25:00.000Z	volvoguy	bilss_	for a server.
2006-11-06T15:25:00.000Z	volvoguy	bilss_	Dapper is LTS while Edgy is not.
2006-11-06T15:26:00.000Z	bilss_	volvoguy	whats LTS mean
2006-11-06T15:26:00.000Z	volvoguy	bilss_	Long Term Support
2006-11-06T15:26:00.000Z	volvoguy	bilss_	it has a longer life cycle than Edgy - it will be officially supported longer.
2006-11-06T15:27:00.000Z	bilss_	volvoguy	its ok i guess but not as soild as sarge
2006-11-06T15:28:00.000Z	volvoguy	bilss_	never tried sarge. this machine has been powered on since the first ubuntu release and only rebooted for new kernels. i've never had any crashes.
2006-11-06T15:31:00.000Z	bilss_	volvoguy	i run a cuple of programs I used apt-get to install both need a pid file in /var/run but evertime i reboot it wipes the /var/run dir strange but on sarge its ok but had dapper now since brezzy but just thought I would give you my view
2006-11-06T15:32:00.000Z	volvoguy	bilss_	hmm.. strange. i've never had to muck around the /var directory much.
2006-11-06T15:33:00.000Z	bilss_	volvoguy	i think sarge and the new testing etch are more robust they are tested and tested again before release ubuntu is a rock for new people to linux
2006-11-06T14:30:00.000Z	bilss_	volvoguy	you.ve been here a while?
2006-11-06T14:30:00.000Z	volvoguy	bilss_	i come and go. :)
2006-11-06T14:31:00.000Z	bilss_	volvoguy	whats the apt-get for this missing library please libstdc++.so.5
2006-11-06T14:32:00.000Z	volvoguy	bilss_	probably "libstdc++5"
