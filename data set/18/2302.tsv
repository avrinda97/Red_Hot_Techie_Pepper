2010-06-22T22:33:00.000Z	joshua_roberts		what is the best theme engine for gnome in Ubuntu?
2010-06-22T22:34:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	joshua_roberts	depends on what you need in terms of effects & flash-e-ness
2010-06-22T22:34:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	joshua_roberts	murrine i would say is good, but y'know 1 day you might find a theme that needs rezlooks hence you switch
2010-06-22T22:35:00.000Z	joshua_roberts		minimal effects, I have a really old video card that has no proprietary driver support, I just want to easily change login themes, desktop themes
2010-06-22T22:35:00.000Z	joshua_roberts		I am using a dell c640 with a radeon mobility 7500 (ATI does not support this card in linux) so I have basic rendering support.
2010-06-22T22:36:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	joshua_roberts	what clock speed cpu and what ram?
2010-06-22T22:36:00.000Z	joshua_roberts		1gig ram 2Ghz P4 I believe
2010-06-22T22:38:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	joshua_roberts	thats pretty good, but if you want lighter just use whatever gtk theme you like, but if you want to 'squeeze' every bit of juice look into alternatives to gnome and compiz, something like openbox with tint2 to replace gnome + gnome panel
2010-06-22T22:39:00.000Z	joshua_roberts		I don't want to squeeze.  I need my extra squeeze for blender and gimp, not pretty menus
2010-06-22T22:39:00.000Z	joshua_roberts		so I guess I will try murrine...
2010-06-22T22:40:00.000Z	joshua_roberts	aeon-ltd	thanks
2010-06-22T22:40:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	joshua_roberts	i would still reccomend changing gnome and compiz (including all gnome heavy apps) and switching to lighter alternatives lets say gnome + compiz takes 300mb ram from boot, when i switched to openbox (plus no other gnome dependant apps) boot up was <80mb 220 mb  saving is what you need not a lighter gtk theme
2010-06-22T22:41:00.000Z	joshua_roberts		openbox..  ok
2010-06-22T22:41:00.000Z	joshua_roberts		I will check and see..
2010-06-22T22:41:00.000Z	joshua_roberts		thanks
2010-06-22T22:41:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	joshua_roberts	hope it helps. :)
2010-06-22T22:42:00.000Z	joshua_roberts		It probably will.  I have tried fluxbox, but that is too light weight for me...
2010-06-22T22:43:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	joshua_roberts	the *boxes can look really good though, much better than gnome+metacity/compiz can
