2010-08-29T09:37:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve		hello
2010-08-29T09:38:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve		Really fast, can someone tell me if there is a log of what is installed on my system, either something kept by aptitude or apt-get ?
2010-08-29T09:38:00.000Z	maco	q_a_z_steve	dpkg --get selections
2010-08-29T09:38:00.000Z	maco	q_a_z_steve	dpkg --get selections | grep " install"
2010-08-29T09:39:00.000Z	maco	q_a_z_steve	the first lists all installs and deinstalls. the second just shows the installs
2010-08-29T09:39:00.000Z	maco	q_a_z_steve	oh dang, put a - in there. --get-selections, not a space
2010-08-29T09:40:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	maco	Sorry maybe I need to clarify, what about something which shows them according to date installed?
2010-08-29T09:40:00.000Z	maco	q_a_z_steve	OH.... no
2010-08-29T09:41:00.000Z	maco	q_a_z_steve	you can view /var/log/apt/term.log but it only goes so far back
2010-08-29T09:41:00.000Z	maco	q_a_z_steve	and it includes things like updates
2010-08-29T09:41:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	maco	how do I set that to maybe back up prior to overwriting?
2010-08-29T09:42:00.000Z	maco	q_a_z_steve	logrotate renames the old one as term.log.1 and then term.log.2.gz but after 7 or so (i think?) it just offs it, so maybe change logrotate to never delete apt logs
2010-08-29T09:43:00.000Z	maco	q_a_z_steve	ive never played with logrotate's configs, but it at least gives you somewhere to look
2010-08-29T09:43:00.000Z	maco	q_a_z_steve	sure you can install irssi on an android phone and irc from the terminal...
2010-08-29T09:43:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	maco	is that an apt command or a stand alone command?
2010-08-29T09:44:00.000Z	maco	q_a_z_steve	logrotate is its own thing. it handles all the stuff in /var/log/*
2010-08-29T09:44:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	maco	okay, sweet thanks.
2010-08-29T09:45:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	maco	ircII is only good for nights like this, if we were any busier I'd be hosed!
