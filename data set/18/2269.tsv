2010-07-04T05:24:00.000Z	daskrEEch		Hello
2010-07-04T05:24:00.000Z	daskrEEch		I'm having an issue with Gconf
2010-07-04T05:25:00.000Z	daskrEEch		 it says the Gnome power manager settings could not be configured
2010-07-04T05:26:00.000Z	daskrEEch		Then evolutiona-alarm hrows and error saying it could not reach GConf for the possible rreason that my TCP/IP settings are not ther or I have a stale NFS lock
2010-07-04T05:27:00.000Z	daskrEEch		no GNome != no machine
2010-07-04T05:27:00.000Z	daskrEEch		Though I would like someone to teach me how to Connect to the wireless via Command line
2010-07-04T05:27:00.000Z	daskrEEch		I thought I had it but I can't get an IP
2010-07-04T05:27:00.000Z	daskrEEch		CLI
2010-07-04T05:28:00.000Z	daskrEEch		Sure
2010-07-04T05:29:00.000Z	daskrEEch		So I have Gnome not initalizing properly after an update. I get a Desktop Wallpaper and two error messages. If I drop to the command line and try to start something and put it to the X Display Iget a repeated message that Gconf cant be contacted (Or dbus) and to check my TCP/IP settings. What should I be looking for?
2010-07-04T05:30:00.000Z	slidinghorn	daskrEEch	what are the error messages?  (if they'll take more than one line, you can use http://paste.ubuntu.com)
2010-07-04T05:30:00.000Z	daskrEEch	slidinghorn	how can I pipe them from the GUI to pastebin?
2010-07-04T05:35:00.000Z	daskrEEch	slidinghorn	how can I 2>| pastebinit ?
2010-07-04T05:37:00.000Z	slidinghorn	daskrEEch	first, you may have to install pastebinit (sudo apt-get install pastebinit) then you just run (command | pastebinit)  if it's an actual error dialog box, then you can just type into the paste.ubuntu.com
2010-07-04T05:37:00.000Z	daskrEEch	slidinghorn	Umm let me see if I can get epiphany started
