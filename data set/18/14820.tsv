2008-06-04T20:23:00.000Z	beggar		oh boy. my ubuntu laptop (specifically, the optical drive) has been giving me FITS today.
2008-06-04T20:24:00.000Z	beggar		I cannot open/close the drive without using the terminal
2008-06-04T20:24:00.000Z	beggar		and any discs that are inserted come up blank
2008-06-04T20:25:00.000Z	beggar		exhausted the search on the ubuntu forums, no help. google search does nothing either.
2008-06-04T20:26:00.000Z	beggar		my /etc/fstab looks right.. i have no clue what to do.
2008-06-04T20:27:00.000Z	beggar		(keep in mind that while I have been using ubuntu for ~6 months, my knowledge of linux is very very small)
2008-06-04T20:27:00.000Z	beggar		anyone here have any experience in optical drives becoming stubborn as mules overnight?
2008-06-04T20:28:00.000Z	Belial	beggar	have you tried booting a known correct live CD, see if it isnt a hardware problem
2008-06-04T20:29:00.000Z	beggar	Belial	I will try
2008-06-04T20:31:00.000Z	beggar	Belial	I have a winxp disk around, it will go to the blue setup screen.
2008-06-04T20:33:00.000Z	Belial	beggar	maybe make an image of a disk and then check dmesg for errors? try 'sudo dmesg -c > /dev/null;dd if=/dev/sda of=~/disc.iso;dmesg' replacing sda with the device your cdrom occupies, it will take a long time but would see if your getting any read errors etc
2008-06-04T20:35:00.000Z	beggar	Belial	just got some rather weird error messages. might be a hardware issue after all. want me to msg you my return?
2008-06-04T20:36:00.000Z	Belial	beggar	drop it into pastebin.ca and paste the link here, better than a pm, then everyone can see :
2008-06-04T20:41:00.000Z	Belial	beggar	looks like hardware problem im afrid, its having trouble seeking
2008-06-04T20:41:00.000Z	Belial	beggar	also its helpful to put the person your speaking to's name prefixing what you say, it highlights it on the other side, almost lost your reply in the chatter :)
2008-06-04T20:43:00.000Z	beggar	Belial	ha, wouldn't you believe the laptop's warranty went out around two weeks ago. oh well, could be worse all in all. thanks a bunch for the response, i can quit crying over spilled milk i suppose.
2008-06-04T20:44:00.000Z	Belial	beggar	sods law, sorry mate
2008-06-04T20:44:00.000Z	Belial	beggar	maybe try a lens head cleaner
