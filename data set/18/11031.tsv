2007-04-09T09:05:00.000Z	Rincewind		hello
2007-04-09T09:06:00.000Z	Rincewind		I have a problem, when I plug usb devices in, they don't show up in ubuntu anymore
2007-04-09T09:06:00.000Z	ikonia	Rincewind	have a look in the syslog and see if they are being detected
2007-04-09T09:07:00.000Z	Rincewind	ikonia	where do I find the syslog?
2007-04-09T09:07:00.000Z	ikonia	Rincewind	/var/log
2007-04-09T09:11:00.000Z	Rincewind	ikonia	can please have a look here: http://rafb.net/p/d4WnyL28.html
2007-04-09T09:11:00.000Z	ikonia	Rincewind	yes they are being detected as scsi disks
2007-04-09T09:12:00.000Z	ikonia	Rincewind	yes - thats correct
2007-04-09T09:12:00.000Z	ikonia	Rincewind	you could attempt to mount them manually "man mount" to see how the mount command works
2007-04-09T09:15:00.000Z	Rincewind	ikonia	I am not a native english speaker and don't understand the man page. Can you tell me what the mount command would be for me?
2007-04-09T09:16:00.000Z	ikonia	Rincewind	you can install ubuntu in your native language
2007-04-09T09:19:00.000Z	Rincewind	ikonia	that doesn't help me with the man page, it is still in english
2007-04-09T09:19:00.000Z	ikonia	Rincewind	I was suggedting that you may want to install in your native language to stop that problem
2007-04-09T09:20:00.000Z	ikonia	Rincewind	there is also #ubuntu-de to assist in your native language
2007-04-09T09:20:00.000Z	ikonia	Rincewind	ahhh great, so if you read the man pages in your native language should be fine
2007-04-09T09:21:00.000Z	ikonia	Rincewind	no thats not correct
2007-04-09T09:22:00.000Z	ikonia	Rincewind	you need a mount point
2007-04-09T09:27:00.000Z	Rincewind	ikonia	I get this message: mount: special device sda1 does not exist
