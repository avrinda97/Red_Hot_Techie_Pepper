2010-09-05T03:16:00.000Z	luw		hi again, so my system settings say "direct internet connection" and for firefox, they say use system settings.  however, with these settings it takes very long to resolve a host.  if i select "no proxy" in firefox, speed seems to be lighting fast again.   IT sounds fishy to me...
2010-09-05T03:17:00.000Z	usr13	luw	Check to see what nameserver(s) you are using.  ( /etc/resolv.conf )
2010-09-05T03:18:00.000Z	usr13	luw	Are you actually using a proxy server?  Do you have a proxy server on your network?
2010-09-05T03:19:00.000Z	usr13	luw	If you are telling firefox to use a proxy server, you are going to bypass what ever nameserver you have coded into /etc/resolv.conf  so....
2010-09-05T03:19:00.000Z	luw	usr13	no i do not have a proxy setup, i have a name server and thats the only thing listed in my /etc/resolv.conf
2010-09-05T03:19:00.000Z	luw	usr13	i would like to keep firefox as "use system settings" however, it takes very long to resolve hosts it say
2010-09-05T03:19:00.000Z	usr13	luw	Then do not tell firefox to try and use a proxer server, (which does not exist in the first place).
2010-09-05T03:20:00.000Z	luw	usr13	ok understood
2010-09-05T03:20:00.000Z	luw	usr13	however, im wondering how the setting got set in the first place?  is that default?  im a very parinoid person....
2010-09-05T03:20:00.000Z	usr13	luw	And use the closest / fastest nameserver you can.
2010-09-05T03:22:00.000Z	luw	usr13	i have a small 1000bt network in my house (< 30 computers) and i only use the nameserver to make my life easier
2010-09-05T03:22:00.000Z	usr13	luw	Actually, you sould go with the one recommended by your ISP.  But if your router is coded with the one from the ISP you can use the router's caching nameserver, (which it should be sending to your PC to be placed automatically into /etc/resolv.conf in the first place).
2010-09-05T03:25:00.000Z	luw	usr13	it is typical for routers to hold a list of name servers?  i am using smoothwall 3.0
2010-09-05T03:26:00.000Z	luw	usr13	i am just unsure how the whole thing works
2010-09-05T03:26:00.000Z	usr13	luw	The list of nameservers is placed there only by the one that sets up the network configurations on it.
2010-09-05T03:28:00.000Z	usr13	luw	It is a good idea (once in a while) to check to make sure that the first one on the list is up and running and actually resolving domain names. Actually, now days, most of us just put one in there   and if something happens to it, we just find another to use, (the alternate one suggested by the ISP).
2010-09-05T03:29:00.000Z	luw	usr13	so i should check this at the user level at this computer here?  how would you go about doing that
2010-09-05T03:30:00.000Z	usr13	luw	Place the one you want to test in your /etc/resolv.conf and see if it resolves ok.  (Put only one in there and see if it works)
