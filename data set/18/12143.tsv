2006-07-15T07:24:00.000Z	NthDegree		ok that'll be msdos more than likely
2006-07-15T07:25:00.000Z	NthDegree		try grub-install (hd0)
2006-07-15T07:25:00.000Z	NthDegree		grub-install
2006-07-15T07:25:00.000Z	NthDegree		hmmmmm
2006-07-15T07:25:00.000Z	NthDegree		it can't find hd0 either then
2006-07-15T07:26:00.000Z	NthDegree		bikini normally it would either be /dev/sda or /dev/hda
2006-07-15T07:27:00.000Z	NthDegree		try grub-install /dev/hda1 then
2006-07-15T07:27:00.000Z	NthDegree		you can install to partition superblock as opposed to all loaded in mbr
2006-07-15T07:28:00.000Z	NthDegree		it does
2006-07-15T07:30:00.000Z	NthDegree		you have to select "manually edit the partition table" then edit /dev/hdb2 and then put "do not use this partition"  - if that isn;t there then the live installer is retarded
2006-07-15T07:31:00.000Z	Warbo	NthDegree	Well the live installer can't handle LVM I don't think, so a few months ago I would have needed the alternate disc
2006-07-15T07:32:00.000Z	Warbo	NthDegree	Well that always helps :)
2006-09-04T06:13:00.000Z	NthDegree	Warbo	I believe the passwords to accounts are stored in ,dat files in a hashed MD5 format
2006-09-04T06:14:00.000Z	Warbo	NthDegree	I use fetchyahoo to get the emails, so the passwords for Yahoo are in fetchyahoo config files, I am just wondering if there is anything else sensitive that might be in the mbox file?
2006-09-04T06:15:00.000Z	NthDegree	Warbo	besides information relation to your operating system and the software usually most sensitive info is kept in separate files
2006-09-04T06:15:00.000Z	Warbo	NthDegree	OK thanks
2006-09-04T06:16:00.000Z	NthDegree	Warbo	it may be a case of copy & paste e-mails into open-office or importing into thunderbird for extra safety
2006-09-04T06:16:00.000Z	Warbo	NthDegree	I suppose, just that I want to alert my University that they have sent out emails with every student's email address in the header, and that is a lot to copy
