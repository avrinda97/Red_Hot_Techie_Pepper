2009-01-07T23:38:00.000Z	b0nn		hrm, how do I find my cdrom and mount it?
2009-01-07T23:39:00.000Z	b0nn		when I try to mount /dev/cdrom1 I get:
2009-01-07T23:39:00.000Z	b0nn		mount: block device /dev/scd0 is write-protected, mounting read-only
2009-01-07T23:39:00.000Z	b0nn		mount: /dev/scd0: can't read superblock
2009-01-07T23:39:00.000Z	ikonia	b0nn	cd's are read only
2009-01-07T23:40:00.000Z	ikonia	b0nn	it's mounted
2009-01-07T23:40:00.000Z	ikonia	b0nn	it was warning you that it's mounted read only
2009-01-07T23:42:00.000Z	ikonia	b0nn	what command did you use, exactly
2009-01-07T23:43:00.000Z	ikonia	b0nn	cd's are not vfat
2009-01-07T23:43:00.000Z	ikonia	b0nn	just use the command "sudo mount /dev/cdrom1 /media/cdrom"
2009-01-07T23:44:00.000Z	ikonia	b0nn	cd's normally automount when you put them in (I assume your using a gnome desktop)
2009-01-07T23:44:00.000Z	ikonia	b0nn	what is on this cd ?
2009-01-07T23:45:00.000Z	ikonia	b0nn	ok - so how do you know it's not blank
2009-01-07T23:45:00.000Z	ikonia	b0nn	hence why it's asking for a file system
2009-01-07T23:46:00.000Z	ikonia	b0nn	are you using gnome desktop ?
2009-01-07T23:46:00.000Z	ikonia	b0nn	what desktop are you using ?
2009-01-07T23:46:00.000Z	ikonia	b0nn	ok, kde
2009-01-07T23:46:00.000Z	ikonia	b0nn	so when you put the cd in, if there is data on it, kde should auto mount it for you, the fact that it's not doing that, and the mount command is asking for an FS suggests it's blank
