2009-08-30T03:22:00.000Z	Gnea	azerty	just ask your question, in as much technical detail as possible.
2009-08-30T03:23:00.000Z	azerty	Gnea	well:  i insert 8.04 LTS to install it (and i have no access to any other CD) in my computer: i get a SQUASHFS error
2009-08-30T03:24:00.000Z	Gnea	azerty	did you burn the cd yourself?
2009-08-30T03:25:00.000Z	azerty	Gnea	i don t have at BIOS the possibility to change any IDE settings
2009-08-30T03:26:00.000Z	Gnea	azerty	that's not a 'yes' or 'no' answer.
2009-08-30T03:26:00.000Z	azerty	Gnea	so all I read in forums is useless. i still can  t boot from livecd
2009-08-30T03:26:00.000Z	Gnea	azerty	the fact that you're not answering my troubleshooting questions means that, yes, it is useless.
2009-08-30T03:29:00.000Z	Gnea	azerty	so did you burn the cd yourself or did you get it in the mail?
