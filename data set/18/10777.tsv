2012-02-13T08:19:00.000Z	oasisfleeting		I ran an "apt-get install linux-source-2.6.39.4" but I don't see the unpacked archive in my usr/src/ directory. Does anyone know why?
2012-02-13T08:20:00.000Z	oasisfleeting		I need to copy a file into that folder but it says the directory doesn't exist
2012-02-13T08:21:00.000Z	holstein	oasisfleeting	i would give the bigger picture.. whats are you trying to do? what guide are you following... etc
2012-02-13T08:21:00.000Z	oasisfleeting		you're right.
2012-02-13T08:21:00.000Z	oasisfleeting		sorry about that.
2012-02-13T08:22:00.000Z	oasisfleeting		I'm attempting to install the compat wireless drivers for a wireless usb adapter. I'm following this article http://hezik.nl/?p=232
2012-02-13T08:23:00.000Z	oasisfleeting		There is a step that involves creating a sym link in the linux-source-2.6.39.4 directory but i'm getting errors saying that directory doesn't exist
2012-02-13T08:23:00.000Z	oasisfleeting		ln -s /usr/src/linux-headers-2.6.39.4/Module.symvers /usr/src/linux-source-2.6.39.4/Module.symvers
2012-02-13T08:23:00.000Z	oasisfleeting		okay zillow.
2012-02-13T08:27:00.000Z	oasisfleeting	Zillow	I the Module.symvers is in the headers directory. It's the other directory that I can't seem to find. the destination folder /usr/src/linux-source-2.6.39.4/ is the one I can't find.
2012-02-13T08:29:00.000Z	oasisfleeting	Zillow	yes. That returned /usr/src/linux-source-2.6.38/Debian.src.changelog.
2012-02-13T08:33:00.000Z	oasisfleeting	Zillow	let me ask you a question. I did an "apt-get install linux-source-2.6.39.4" So why is my debian changelog in linux-source-2.6.38?
2012-02-13T08:33:00.000Z	oasisfleeting		wget it? wget what?
2012-02-13T08:34:00.000Z	oasisfleeting		oh
2012-02-13T08:34:00.000Z	oasisfleeting		I have already gotten it.
2012-02-13T08:34:00.000Z	oasisfleeting		i can see the tar in my usr/src/ directory
2012-02-13T08:35:00.000Z	oasisfleeting		I'm still pretty new to linux. perhaps you can enlighten me?
2012-02-13T08:36:00.000Z	holstein	oasisfleeting	looks like you found what you were looking for.. no?.. maybe apt-get source is more what you are looking for?
