2007-11-17T22:38:00.000Z	erUSUL	Arelis	maybe you can just compile the drivers itself... for this you usually need build essential and 'sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r)'
2007-11-17T22:38:00.000Z	erUSUL	Arelis	build-essential (a package)
2007-11-17T22:39:00.000Z	Arelis	erUSUL	how? can i just compile the drivers and load them, without recompiling the kernel? and if so, how? and what other libraries do I need?
2007-11-17T22:40:00.000Z	erUSUL	Arelis	dunno usually the tar.gz come with a README or INSTALL file that describes the process
2007-11-17T22:40:00.000Z	Arelis	erUSUL	do i need to remove the packaged wacom drivers first?
2007-11-17T22:43:00.000Z	erUSUL	Arelis	i checked the linuxwacom page and it seems far from trivial... you also need to install a Xorg driver...
2007-11-17T22:44:00.000Z	Arelis	erUSUL	please explain
2007-11-17T22:45:00.000Z	Arelis	erUSUL	please explain
2007-11-17T22:46:00.000Z	erUSUL	Arelis	i think that for someone that has never compiled drivers or installed thingd from source it can be a hard task
2007-11-17T22:49:00.000Z	Arelis	erUSUL	can you guide me through it, in private message?
2007-11-17T22:51:00.000Z	erUSUL	Arelis	sorry but i have to fly.
2007-11-17T22:52:00.000Z	Arelis	erUSUL	alright.. bye
