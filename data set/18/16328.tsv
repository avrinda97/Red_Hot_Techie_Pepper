2004-10-07T09:15:00.000Z	sri	cybrjackle|lappy	yeah, mine is like a fresh cd from today I think
2004-10-07T09:23:00.000Z	sri	cybrjackle|lappy	I run X so it only pulls up an xterm, and then I start doing metacity, gnome-panel, nautilus
2004-10-07T09:23:00.000Z	sri	cybrjackle|lappy	it's not all of it but it's enough to see which parts might be causing the problem
2004-10-07T09:24:00.000Z	cybrjackle|lappy	sri	try opeing gnome-pannel
2004-10-07T09:24:00.000Z	sri	cybrjackle|lappy	it works fine and I did an apt-get upgrade earlier
2004-10-07T09:51:00.000Z	cybrjackle|lappy	sri	cat /proc/version
2004-10-07T09:53:00.000Z	cybrjackle|lappy	sri	did you build it as a modules
2004-10-07T09:54:00.000Z	sri	cybrjackle|lappy	I did, well, here is what I did.
2004-10-07T09:54:00.000Z	sri	cybrjackle|lappy	apt-get install linux-headers-2.6.8.1-2
2004-10-07T09:55:00.000Z	sri	cybrjackle|lappy	then in /usr/src I linked linux-headers-2.6.8-1-2 to linux (symlink)
2004-10-07T09:55:00.000Z	sri	cybrjackle|lappy	then in teh ndiswrapper source area, I just typed make and it started toc ompile it
2004-10-07T09:55:00.000Z	sri	cybrjackle|lappy	and then make install
2004-10-07T09:56:00.000Z	sri	cybrjackle|lappy	any ideas?
2004-10-07T09:56:00.000Z	sri	cybrjackle|lappy	the only other thing I can do is build a custom kernel
2004-10-07T09:57:00.000Z	sri	cybrjackle|lappy	cybrjackle|lappy easier than make KSRC=/usr/src/linux-headers-x.x.x
2004-10-07T09:57:00.000Z	sri	cybrjackle|lappy	I haven't. I thought you only needed the linux-headers
2004-10-07T09:57:00.000Z	sri	cybrjackle|lappy	if you're going to just make a module from the stock debian one
2004-10-07T10:01:00.000Z	cybrjackle|lappy	sri	do you need gcc installed?
