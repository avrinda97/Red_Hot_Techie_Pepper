2007-12-06T22:33:00.000Z	JuJuBee		I want to get a UPS, is there one that has software that works with Ubuntu to shut down safely?
2007-12-06T22:33:00.000Z	Dr_willis	JuJuBee	 i saw just the other day an anouncement that some Major Brand UPS maker was supporting Ubuntu

2007-12-06T22:36:00.000Z	JuJuBee	Dr_willis	: thanks.
2007-12-06T22:36:00.000Z	Dr_willis	JuJuBee	 that may be more of a BIG BUSINESS type site/company. :)
2007-12-06T22:38:00.000Z	JuJuBee	Dr_willis	: looks that way.  I just need something simple like the APC home versions.
2007-12-07T21:52:00.000Z	Dr_willis	JuJuBee	 unzip whatever.zip
2007-12-07T21:52:00.000Z	Dr_willis	JuJuBee	 or use 'unp' :)
2007-12-07T21:53:00.000Z	JuJuBee	Dr_willis	: not letting me unzip *.zip for some reason.  I have many files and do not wish to do them 1 by 1.
2007-12-07T21:53:00.000Z	Dr_willis	JuJuBee	 if you had asked that first.. :) i also have the answer to that!
2007-12-07T21:54:00.000Z	Dr_willis	JuJuBee	 unzip is one of the FEW prograsm vie seen that can do that this way.. .heh     unzip '*.zip'    NOTE the quotes.
2007-12-07T21:54:00.000Z	Dr_willis	JuJuBee	 its seems to have its own wildcard parsing feature. or at least it used to
2007-12-07T21:55:00.000Z	Dr_willis	JuJuBee	 no idea why unzipis a bit nonstandard int hat way.. erUSUL 's advice is good for all apps in teneral.
2007-12-07T21:55:00.000Z	Dr_willis	JuJuBee	 the use of the ' find | xargs  ' is DARN handy to learn/rember about.
2008-03-11T17:02:00.000Z	Dr_willis	JuJuBee	 /tmp ?
2008-03-11T17:03:00.000Z	Dr_willis	JuJuBee	 /var/cache/apt perhaps also
2008-03-11T17:05:00.000Z	JuJuBee	Dr_willis	: how about all of /var/cache ?
2008-03-11T17:05:00.000Z	Dr_willis	JuJuBee	 Possibially
