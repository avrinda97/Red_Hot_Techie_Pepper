2009-08-11T22:09:00.000Z	Squynti		hey what are the terminals used for from ctrl+alt F1 to ctrl+alt F6 or 7?
2009-08-11T22:09:00.000Z	grawity	Squynti	tty1 to tty7
2009-08-11T22:09:00.000Z	grawity	Squynti	Technically, there are more - up to tty63
2009-08-11T22:10:00.000Z	Squynti	grawity	right but are they used differently?
2009-08-11T22:10:00.000Z	Squynti	grawity	how to do that?
2009-08-11T22:10:00.000Z	grawity	Squynti	The ones after tty7 are simply not used by default. (They are possible to use though)
2009-08-11T22:11:00.000Z	Squynti	grawity	when I reach past tty7 it goes back up to windows
2009-08-11T22:12:00.000Z	grawity	Squynti	In the default configuration, tty1-6 are terminal logins, tty7 is X, and the rest are not allocated.
2009-08-11T22:13:00.000Z	Squynti	grawity	I see that F1 is different from the others... to me it seem like they meant for some its own reason?
2009-08-11T22:13:00.000Z	grawity	Squynti	tty1 is the first one, which means it is selected on boot (until you or GDM change it).
2009-08-11T22:13:00.000Z	grawity	Squynti	And kernel messages go to the currently selected tty.
2009-08-11T22:14:00.000Z	grawity	Squynti	GNOME Display Manager - the app that shows graphical login screen, runs GNOME or whatever, etc.
2009-08-11T22:14:00.000Z	Squynti	grawity	so tty1 is safe to use?
2009-08-11T22:14:00.000Z	grawity	Squynti	Yes, all of them are safe to use.
2009-08-11T22:15:00.000Z	grawity	Squynti	There are commands 'openvt' for running bash on an unused tty; 'chvt' for changing ttys; and so on.
2009-08-11T22:16:00.000Z	grawity	Squynti	a little correction... F1 is just the key on your keyboard, which happens to switch to the first tty. The actual things are usually called either consoles, terminals, or ttys. (Sometimes "virtual" ones)
2009-08-11T22:16:00.000Z	grawity	Squynti	Anyway, tty1 is safe to use.
2009-08-11T22:17:00.000Z	Squynti	grawity	Ok thanks. I was searching for the information for that but I seem cannot find it.
