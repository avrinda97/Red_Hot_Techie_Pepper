2011-12-15T21:00:00.000Z	usr13	Peachez	Not sure what you've done so would be hard to say.
2011-12-15T21:03:00.000Z	usr13	Peachez	If we knew what services you dissabled, we might be able to give you more specific advise, but otherwise... ???
2011-12-15T21:06:00.000Z	usr13	Peachez	If we knew what you did, we might be able to give you some specific advise.
2011-12-15T21:06:00.000Z	usr13	Peachez	But you could try:  sudo service gdm start
2011-12-15T21:08:00.000Z	usr13	Peachez	If you could give us some specific details about what you've done, we might be able to give you specific advise on how to undue it.
2011-12-15T21:09:00.000Z	usr13	Peachez	Did you follow instructions from some website?  Or...?
2011-12-15T21:13:00.000Z	usr13	Peachez	You should find  sabnzbdplus  in the package manager.  (If you use the package manager to install, you have far fewer problems.)
2011-12-15T21:14:00.000Z	usr13	Peachez	Or DID you install sabnzbd from the package manager?
2011-12-15T21:15:00.000Z	usr13	Peachez	Is this it?:    http://wiki.sabnzbd.org/install-ubuntu-repo
2011-12-15T21:16:00.000Z	usr13	Peachez	If you look at the top of that page, you'll see the date is  "2008"  (3 years ago....)
2011-12-15T21:17:00.000Z	usr13	Peachez	 Some of what that page tells you to do may be un-necessary for today's Ubuntu systems.
2011-12-15T21:18:00.000Z	usr13	Peachez	Well, if you could tell us specifically what you did to try and add it to startups, we might be able to give you specific advise as to how to undue what you've done.
2011-12-15T21:20:00.000Z	usr13	Peachez	But looking at that page now, I see that mostly it is ok or good advise.  Nothing there that would break your system.
2011-12-15T21:20:00.000Z	usr13	Peachez	Yea, if you could find where you got instructions for adding it to startup we might be able to see what has been done.
2011-12-15T21:22:00.000Z	usr13	Peachez	You might just try this:  sudo apt-get update ; sudo apt-get upgrade
2011-12-15T21:23:00.000Z	usr13	Peachez	Where did you get that quoted sentence from?
2011-12-15T21:27:00.000Z	Peachez	usr13	- tried what you said (update \ upgrade) rebooted and now presented with - starting bluetooth OK, Pulseaudio configured for per-user sessions saned disabled: edit /etc/default/saned. SABnzbdplus binanry news grabber , not configured, aborting. See /etc/default/SABnzbdplus.
2011-12-15T21:34:00.000Z	usr13	Peachez	Edit the file that you placed the command in and delete the line you added.
