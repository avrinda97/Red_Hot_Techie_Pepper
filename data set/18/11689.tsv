2006-12-16T15:03:00.000Z	bruenig	madman91	you aren't missing much believe me
2006-12-16T15:03:00.000Z	madman91	bruenig	i know .. i just want one more thing on my list of pointless things to do
2006-12-16T15:04:00.000Z	bruenig	madman91	you can get the firefox from getfirefox.com, all you have to do is extract it and run the firefox script in the directory
2007-01-28T08:13:00.000Z	bruenig	madman91	are you burning an iso?
2007-01-28T08:13:00.000Z	madman91	bruenig	yes
2007-01-28T08:14:00.000Z	bruenig	madman91	you can see what sort of cpu usage you get doing it from command line: growisofs -dvd-compat -Z /dev/hd?=whatever.iso
2007-01-28T08:14:00.000Z	madman91	bruenig	does that burn?
2007-01-28T08:15:00.000Z	bruenig	madman91	yeah
2007-01-28T08:15:00.000Z	madman91	bruenig	well i am burning it now...
2007-01-28T08:15:00.000Z	bruenig	madman91	make sure you replace ? and whatever
2007-01-28T08:15:00.000Z	bruenig	madman91	well what was your question then
2007-01-28T08:16:00.000Z	madman91	bruenig	why do k3b and gnomebaker use so much cpu power?
2007-01-28T08:16:00.000Z	bruenig	madman91	well you should test it from the command line, since that is the command they use and see if the cpu usage is different. If it isn't different then you know that it isn't the apps but the burning itself
2007-01-28T08:17:00.000Z	madman91	bruenig	ok thanks
2007-01-28T08:17:00.000Z	madman91	bruenig	if it helps.. gnomebaker uses dd
2007-01-28T08:17:00.000Z	bruenig	madman91	it uses growisofs, that little builtin dd thing is the first line of output from the growisofs command
2007-07-11T06:03:00.000Z	madman91	bruenig	why would you need rss? lame
2007-07-11T06:04:00.000Z	bruenig	madman91	I do need it, I like to have daily show and colbert waiting for me when I wake up
