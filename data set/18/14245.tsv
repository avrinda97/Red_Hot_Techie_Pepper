2009-12-08T11:09:00.000Z	mah2223		if not i was thinking about just removing everything else from the partition, formating it with fat32, and moving everything back
2009-12-08T11:09:00.000Z	mah2223		thats a good plan, right?
2009-12-08T11:10:00.000Z	mah2223		oh, that's right i didnt tell you
2009-12-08T11:10:00.000Z	mah2223		its REALLY BIG
2009-12-08T11:10:00.000Z	mah2223		its like 200 gigs lol
2009-12-08T11:11:00.000Z	mah2223		lol
2009-12-08T11:12:00.000Z	mah2223		yeah thats what im doing, im actually going to go to bed and see how it went in the morning- im asking you about my plan b though if checkdisk doesn't work because you probably won't be around in like 8 hours
2009-12-08T11:12:00.000Z	mah2223		and fat32 is better right? like i feel like i wouldnt have this problem on fat32
2009-12-08T11:13:00.000Z	mah2223		yeah but i need something windows can see
2009-12-08T11:14:00.000Z	mah2223		do you mind telling me why?
2009-12-08T11:14:00.000Z	mneptok	mah2223	FAT32 is better in that it is far more widely understood than is NTFS
2009-12-08T11:15:00.000Z	mneptok	mah2223	they come like that because FAT32 is far better understood ... yadda yadda
2009-12-08T11:17:00.000Z	mneptok	mah2223	this partition/drive you're formatting. what is its purpose?
2009-12-08T11:18:00.000Z	mneptok	mah2223	FAT32
2009-12-08T11:19:00.000Z	mneptok	mah2223	full stop.
2009-12-08T11:19:00.000Z	mneptok	mah2223	yes, really.
2009-12-08T11:19:00.000Z	mneptok	mah2223	i never said anything different
2009-12-08T11:20:00.000Z	mneptok	mah2223	no, IIRC, it cannot.
