2005-03-02T06:19:00.000Z	mz2		huh? rhythmbox just randomly works and doesn't work
2005-03-02T06:19:00.000Z	mz2		if i try selecting a song a few times, it just starts to play it, and most of the time just says that vague cannot pause playback
2005-03-02T06:21:00.000Z	mz2		i had this sort of problems like a year ago last time :)
2005-03-02T06:21:00.000Z	Lathiat	mz2	check what sound system gstreamer is using
2005-03-02T06:21:00.000Z	mz2		esd
2005-03-02T06:21:00.000Z	Lathiat		positive?
2005-03-02T06:21:00.000Z	mz2		or rather, polypaudio
2005-03-02T06:21:00.000Z	mz2		yes
2005-03-02T06:21:00.000Z	Lathiat		well yeh thats ok

2005-03-02T06:22:00.000Z	mz2		maybe it just has a bad day
2005-03-02T06:22:00.000Z	Lathiat		i have issues with it on first start
2005-03-02T06:22:00.000Z	Lathiat		if i kill and start it again it works fine
