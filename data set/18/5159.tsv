2008-12-21T03:05:00.000Z	click170_		Um, which of the system menus is Synaptic regularly in?
2008-12-21T03:06:00.000Z	click170_		And more importantly, how does one put the Synaptic shortcut back in the menu, as mine has deleted itself somehow?
2008-12-21T03:07:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	click170_	System --> Preferences --> Main Menu
2008-12-21T03:08:00.000Z	click170_	onetinsoldier	Thankyou!!!
2008-12-21T03:08:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	click170_	you're welcome :-)
2008-12-21T03:10:00.000Z	click170_	onetinsoldier	Do you know why it would be unchecking itsellf?  Its ding it repeatedly.  I check it, and seconds later, even with the window open, it unchecks itself.
2008-12-21T03:10:00.000Z	click170_	onetinsoldier	If its any difference, the name is in italics for some reason
2008-12-21T03:11:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	click170_	no! i don't know... hmmm
2008-12-21T03:12:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	click170_	i will try to poke around a little and see if i can tell anything, but i doubt i'll figure out why it's doing that to you. i will say, it sounds like a permission issue
2008-12-21T03:12:00.000Z	click170_	onetinsoldier	Which is the folder I should check, .local?
2008-12-21T03:15:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	click170_	i doubt this will do anything, but go here... System --> Preferences --> Appearance --> Interface Tab --> check 'Editable menu shortcut keys'  ..but as i said, i have doubts that will help
2008-12-21T03:16:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	click170_	local? is this a remote issue?
2008-12-21T03:17:00.000Z	click170_	onetinsoldier	You mentioned you suspected a permissions issue, but where, in what folder?  I thought the menus and stuff was in a .local folder or something
2008-12-21T03:18:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	click170_	yeah. it's in files and folders i'm sure.. but i was talking baout using the gui tool.. via the menu up top! the upper task bar
