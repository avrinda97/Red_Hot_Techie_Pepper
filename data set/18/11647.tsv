2006-07-26T15:24:00.000Z	crimsun	goonies	did you generate the initramfs for your custom kernel if you didn't compile in support for your root fs and the drive's controller type?
2006-07-26T15:24:00.000Z	goonies	crimsun	yes i did
2006-07-26T15:24:00.000Z	crimsun	goonies	please keep the support question in here
2006-07-26T15:25:00.000Z	crimsun	goonies	what was the syntax you used to generate it?
2006-07-26T15:25:00.000Z	goonies	crimsun	http://doc.gwos.org/index.php/Kernel_Compilation_Dapper
2006-07-26T15:27:00.000Z	crimsun	goonies	that guide doesn't tell me how you generated your own initramfs, though.
2006-07-26T15:30:00.000Z	crimsun	goonies	that doesn't work properly. You need to regenerate the initramfs /manually/ after installing the linux-image deb.
2006-07-26T15:30:00.000Z	goonies	crimsun	how do i do it manually
2006-07-26T15:31:00.000Z	crimsun	goonies	use mkinitramfs.
2006-07-26T15:32:00.000Z	crimsun	goonies	if they're built-in, then don't use the initrd line.
2006-07-26T15:32:00.000Z	goonies	crimsun	let me try that
2006-07-26T15:34:00.000Z	goonies	crimsun	brb
2006-07-26T15:34:00.000Z	crimsun	goonies	just diff names for the same
2006-07-26T15:44:00.000Z	goonies	crimsun	Kernel panic - not syncing: VFS: unable to mount root from unknown-block(0,0)
2006-07-26T15:45:00.000Z	crimsun	goonies	post the .config used to generate that kernel.
