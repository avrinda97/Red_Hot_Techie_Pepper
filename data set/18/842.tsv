2011-08-17T01:25:00.000Z	munzxttt	jwiggins	: sorry! new to linux! ... can u explain what do u mean plz?!
2011-08-17T01:25:00.000Z	jwiggins	munzxttt	when you ran that command, it should have spit out a few lines stating "X frames in Y seconds"
2011-08-17T01:30:00.000Z	jwiggins	munzxttt	what brand video card do you have?
2011-08-17T01:30:00.000Z	munzxttt	jwiggins	: ATI
2011-08-17T01:31:00.000Z	jwiggins	munzxttt	okay open up the "Ubuntu Software Center" it should be in your program menu
2011-08-17T01:32:00.000Z	jwiggins	munzxttt	then search for ATI, there is an ATI driver there you can install. Once done you will need to restart X, it will be easiest if you just restart the PC
