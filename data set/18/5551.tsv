2012-10-25T14:20:00.000Z	jrib	gaetano_	interesting bug.  I haven't seen it before.  You might want to mention your ubuntu version.  Check http://bugs.ubuntu.com for something similar
2012-10-25T14:21:00.000Z	gaetano_		i got ubuntustudio 12.10
2012-10-25T14:21:00.000Z	gaetano_	jrib	i got ubuntustudio 12.10
2012-10-25T14:23:00.000Z	gaetano_	jrib	what colours do u see on ubuntu software center!? about letters and background
2012-10-25T14:24:00.000Z	jrib	gaetano_	I don't use software center
2012-10-25T14:24:00.000Z	gaetano_	jrib	programs there are not good?
2012-10-25T14:25:00.000Z	gaetano_	jrib	ps. im new with ubuntu...
2012-10-25T14:25:00.000Z	jrib	gaetano_	they are.  I just prefer using the terminal.  There's nothing wrong with software center
2012-10-25T14:25:00.000Z	jrib	gaetano_	did you install some themes maybe?  Does it happen with any other program?
2012-10-25T14:25:00.000Z	jrib		!ask | arie
2012-10-25T14:28:00.000Z	gaetano_	jrib	i previously tried to install 3d graphic tweaks but they didnt work,  in fact i cant even run 3d programs...but aside that, didnt install any theme
2012-10-25T14:28:00.000Z	jrib	gaetano_	k, well I don't know about your issue.  Check http://bugs.ubuntu.com for something similar while you wait for someone else to come along that can help you
2012-10-25T14:30:00.000Z	gaetano_	jrib	ok! thank u very much for the advice...its a very strange bug though isn it?
2012-10-25T14:31:00.000Z	jrib	gaetano_	yes...  Though there was some nvidia-related bug where everyone showed up blue (like smurfs).  That one is pretty weird too :P
2012-10-25T14:34:00.000Z	gaetano_	jrib	could be possible that theres something uncompatible with my graphic card and ubuntustudio??
2012-10-25T14:36:00.000Z	jrib	gaetano_	I have no idea to be honest
2012-10-25T14:36:00.000Z	jrib	gaetano_	maybe create a new user and see if it happens there.  If what's important?
