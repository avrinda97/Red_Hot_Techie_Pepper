2006-06-10T16:05:00.000Z	trippyskippy	uXp	 its a version number of a package
2006-06-10T16:08:00.000Z	trippyskippy	uXp	"uname -r"
2006-06-10T16:11:00.000Z	trippyskippy	uXp	are you trying to install the package you need through synaptic?
2006-06-10T16:13:00.000Z	trippyskippy	uXp	are you in synaptic now?
2006-06-10T16:14:00.000Z	trippyskippy	uXp	the error was because you were trying to install an out of date version of libglib2.0
2006-06-10T16:14:00.000Z	trippyskippy	uXp	sorry mate search for "libglib"
2006-06-10T16:16:00.000Z	trippyskippy	uXp	once you get the search results scroll down to "libglib2.0-dev" and tell me what the "installed version" and "latest version" columns say
2006-06-10T16:17:00.000Z	trippyskippy	uXp	 ok thats wierd, i want you click the reload button, and then look again
2006-06-10T16:18:00.000Z	trippyskippy	uXp	if reload doesnt change the latest version to 2.10.3 then i want you to do "gedit /etc/apt/sources.list" and pastebin it
2006-06-10T16:23:00.000Z	trippyskippy	uXp	how is pastebin coming on?
2006-06-10T16:24:00.000Z	trippyskippy	uXp	you have to post the url of the pastebin page it went to here
2006-06-10T16:28:00.000Z	trippyskippy	uXp	go into repositorys and disble all of them, then just read the official ones
