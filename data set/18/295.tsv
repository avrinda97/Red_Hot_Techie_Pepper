2012-05-01T16:06:00.000Z	escott	hRL	what is the error message exactly?
2012-05-01T16:07:00.000Z	hRL	escott	i get premission denied error while it creates log in temp file
2012-05-01T16:09:00.000Z	escott	hRL	the exact error message would help. can you post a screenshot or something? I cant tell if this is permission denied creating a log in windows or permission denied inside the wubi install
2012-05-01T16:13:00.000Z	hRL	escott	i have posted screenshot
2012-05-01T16:13:00.000Z	escott	hRL	thats not saying permission denied when creating the logfile. its saying permission denied SEE the log file for more details. wee need to see that referenced logfile
2012-05-01T16:13:00.000Z	hRL	escott	can you help me with that please ..
2012-05-01T16:14:00.000Z	escott	hRL	if you will paste that file we can look at it
2012-05-01T16:14:00.000Z	hRL	escott	you want log file?
2012-05-01T16:15:00.000Z	escott	hRL	yes. the log file referenced in the error dialog should contain a detailed description of what went wrong
2012-05-01T16:16:00.000Z	hRL	escott	& ThinkT510 here is paste url http://paste.ubuntu.com/959794/
2012-05-01T16:19:00.000Z	escott	hRL	did you burn an ubuntu CD and put it in your CD drive?
2012-05-01T16:19:00.000Z	hRL	escott	yesss
2012-05-01T16:19:00.000Z	hRL	escott	i got external USB DVD Drive
2012-05-01T16:20:00.000Z	escott	hRL	that shouldnt be necessary. just download the *.iso and put it in the same folder as your wubi.exe installer
2012-05-01T16:20:00.000Z	escott	hRL	that might be part of the problem
2012-05-01T16:20:00.000Z	hRL	escott	or can i use virtual drive?
2012-05-01T16:21:00.000Z	escott	hRL	when debugging it is always better to reduce the complexity. burning cds/using virtual drives just adds complexity. wubi.exe should be able to read ubuntu*.iso FILE and create the wubi system from that file
2012-05-01T16:22:00.000Z	hRL	escott	ok, i will copy *.iso in same drive
