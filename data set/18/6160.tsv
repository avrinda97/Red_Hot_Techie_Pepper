2011-08-17T00:57:00.000Z	slayton		hi all! i'm trying to execute a python program I wrote from my desktop. I can run the program from the terminal just fine by typing python progname.py or by typing ./progname.py  but when I try to execute the command using ALT+f2 or with a desktop icon it doesn't seem to be working...
2011-08-17T00:57:00.000Z	slayton		I tell it to open a terminal and I see the terminal but it closes right away
2011-08-17T00:58:00.000Z	dr_willis	slayton	 it is executable? and the program does start with a proper #! line?
2011-08-17T00:58:00.000Z	slayton	dr_willis	here is the first line #!/usr/bin/env python
2011-08-17T00:59:00.000Z	dr_willis	slayton	 it does have a gui? or is it a cli only app?
2011-08-17T00:59:00.000Z	slayton	dr_willis	GUI
2011-08-17T00:59:00.000Z	dr_willis	slayton	 you could try launching 'xterm -e /the/script/name   &&  read'  perhaps..
2011-08-17T01:00:00.000Z	dr_willis	slayton	 i would 'guess' its most likely somtuing to do with the PATH or other env settings that are not set the same from a terminal, vs launchign it other ways..
2011-08-17T01:01:00.000Z	slayton	dr_willis	hmm... ok i'll see what I can figure out
2011-08-17T01:01:00.000Z	slayton	dr_willis	the call to xterm opens xterm but it closes right away too
2011-08-17T01:02:00.000Z	dr_willis	slayton	but if you just open a xterm, and run it from inside .. it works fine?
2011-08-17T01:03:00.000Z	slayton	dr_willis	ha!
2011-08-17T01:03:00.000Z	slayton	dr_willis	got it
2011-08-17T01:03:00.000Z	dr_willis	slayton	 oh?
2011-08-17T01:04:00.000Z	slayton	dr_willis	the program was looking for a file in a local dir and I didn't provide the absolute path, ugh
2011-08-17T01:04:00.000Z	slayton	dr_willis	so stoopid
2011-08-17T01:04:00.000Z	dr_willis	slayton	 :)
2011-08-17T01:10:00.000Z	dr_willis	slayton	 $home would be a bash type variable/system var. not sure it applys to desktop files.
