2011-10-16T07:47:00.000Z	crash1hd		So would this work? UUID=theuuid/pictures /home/crash1hd/pictures ext4    defaults        0       2
2011-10-16T07:49:00.000Z	arghx	crash1hd	you said it uses samba. how can it work with "ext4" then? and what is this UUID, where did you get that?
2011-10-16T07:50:00.000Z	arghx	crash1hd	does it use samba or is it a normal usb mass storage device?
2011-10-16T07:50:00.000Z	crash1hd	arghx	I have no idea how it works with ext4 but I know it does
2011-10-16T07:50:00.000Z	crash1hd	arghx	on the wdlive I remote connect to my server through the network with samba
2011-10-16T07:51:00.000Z	arghx	crash1hd	unless you explain correctly what you are actually doing, I will stop helping you since you make no sense whatsoever. a wdlive is usually not running ubuntu so OT
2011-10-16T07:52:00.000Z	crash1hd	arghx	its not running ubuntu, I am using the wdlive and remotly connecting over a windows share via sambe to the ubuntu server which has the hdd's that I want to connect to
2011-10-16T07:53:00.000Z	crash1hd	arghx	but for some reason if its a sym link the folder it opens is empty
2011-10-16T07:53:00.000Z	crash1hd	arghx	as in it doesnt follow the link
2011-10-16T07:55:00.000Z	crash1hd	arghx	what is the l for?
2011-10-16T07:55:00.000Z	arghx	crash1hd	man ls
2011-10-16T07:56:00.000Z	crash1hd	arghx	I did use long listing format (I dont know what that means)
2011-10-16T07:56:00.000Z	arghx	crash1hd	show more than just the name and nothing else
2011-10-16T07:57:00.000Z	crash1hd	arghx	ok is that the same as right clicking and making a link in ubuntu or is it different?
2011-10-16T07:57:00.000Z	arghx	crash1hd	it has nothing to do with making a link. "ls" is a program to list files
2011-10-16T07:57:00.000Z	crash1hd	arghx	ahh right
2011-10-16T07:57:00.000Z	crash1hd	arghx	sorry was not thinking :)
