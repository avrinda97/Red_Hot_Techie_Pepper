2010-10-12T22:57:00.000Z	gantry		I began the upgrade to Ubuntu 10.10 using the Update Manager.  During this time, I went walked away from the computer and the monitor's power saver mode has come on.  Now it doesn't seem to recognize the mouse or keyboard so I can't wake the computer.
2010-10-12T22:57:00.000Z	gantry		Is there a way I can ssh in and see if the upgrade is complete?
2010-10-12T22:59:00.000Z	shcherbak	gantry	retty can hijack process, but not sure you have it
2010-10-12T23:00:00.000Z	shcherbak	gantry	or you can just ssh and wait when it is idle and check version
2010-10-12T23:01:00.000Z	gantry	shcherbak	how do I check the version?
2010-10-12T23:02:00.000Z	gantry	shcherbak	and is the version only updated once it is ready to be rebooted?
2010-10-12T23:02:00.000Z	shcherbak		cat /etc/issue
2010-10-12T23:02:00.000Z	gantry	shcherbak	is the version the last package to be updated?
2010-10-12T23:03:00.000Z	shcherbak	gantry	i do not think so, id rather apt-get upgrade first
2010-10-12T23:03:00.000Z	shcherbak	gantry	and check repos
2010-10-12T23:03:00.000Z	gantry	shcherbak	that's a good idea.  If I do an apt-get upgrade it shows that there is a lock on the process
2010-10-12T23:04:00.000Z	shcherbak	gantry	kill apt?
2010-10-12T23:04:00.000Z	gantry	shcherbak	no it's locked because packages are still being installed
2010-10-12T23:05:00.000Z	shcherbak	gantry	just use top or htop to see what up
2010-10-12T23:05:00.000Z	gantry		something happens during the install process where the USB devices are no longer recognized
2010-10-12T23:10:00.000Z	shcherbak	gantry	i think there in restart call after dist upgrade which you can see... going google
2010-10-12T23:14:00.000Z	shcherbak		gantry? you there? uname -a againt list of kernels is centos way
2010-10-12T23:15:00.000Z	shcherbak	gantry	dpkg.log may also help
