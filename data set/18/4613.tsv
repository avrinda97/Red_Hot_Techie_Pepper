2009-06-22T02:24:00.000Z	_CommandeR_		Hi, Im getting this error [http://pastebin.com/m1ef7ed24 ]when booting ubuntu 9.04 Jaunty Jackelope from my USB stick (Created by the Ubuntu 9.04 USB BOOT Creator)
2009-06-22T02:25:00.000Z	matrixblue	_CommandeR_	try unetbootin
2009-06-22T02:26:00.000Z	_CommandeR_	matrixblue	Will do
2009-06-22T03:05:00.000Z	_CommandeR_	matrixblue	How long does it take to make USB boot with the UNetbootin?
2009-06-22T03:06:00.000Z	matrixblue	_CommandeR_	10 - 20 minutes estimated
2009-06-22T03:06:00.000Z	matrixblue	_CommandeR_	could be less
2009-06-22T03:07:00.000Z	_CommandeR_	matrixblue	because it has been for several minutes on 5% loading a 671mb file, i can see that the memory stick does work but it has been there for several minutes
2009-06-22T03:07:00.000Z	matrixblue	_CommandeR_	are you sure you didn't set it to download the iso off of the internet?
2009-06-22T03:09:00.000Z	_CommandeR_	matrixblue	 it did download the latest iso but that went fine, but its on extracting and copying files and been there for several minutes
2009-06-22T03:10:00.000Z	matrixblue	_CommandeR_	that is unusual........format the USB drive if no data is on it and try again. You don't have to download the ISO if you already have it
2009-06-22T03:10:00.000Z	_CommandeR_	matrixblue	i know but i have the iso in my WUBI immage :/
2009-06-22T03:11:00.000Z	_CommandeR_	matrixblue	nwm it just jumped to 6%
2009-06-22T03:12:00.000Z	matrixblue	_CommandeR_	still unusual but keep at it. Are in a WUBI environment?
2009-06-22T03:12:00.000Z	_CommandeR_	matrixblue	nope
2009-06-22T03:12:00.000Z	_CommandeR_	matrixblue	windows 2003 server
2009-06-22T03:12:00.000Z	matrixblue	_CommandeR_	ooohhhhhhh
2009-06-22T03:14:00.000Z	_CommandeR_	matrixblue	Windows XP x64 to be exact.
2009-06-22T03:34:00.000Z	_CommandeR_	matrixblue	Well, i rebooted with the USB stick and still i get this message  = http://pastebin.com/m38bb2b5e
