2007-11-04T12:22:00.000Z	m0u5e		i am getting REALLY weird sound errors
2007-11-04T12:22:00.000Z	m0u5e		is there a sound equivalent of sudo dpkg-reconfigure ?
2007-11-04T12:23:00.000Z	m0u5e		i'm not sure if it's alsa, or the intel driver
2007-11-04T12:23:00.000Z	m0u5e		in particular, my headphoine jack no longer works, although if i turn PCM to full, i can hear a tiny bit of sound
2007-11-04T12:23:00.000Z	m0u5e		also, random songs will have random parts of it filtered out
2007-11-04T12:24:00.000Z	m0u5e		for example, i'm playing bohemian rhapsody, and sometimes the choir's voice just disappears
2007-11-04T12:24:00.000Z	m0u5e		while the rest of the song still plays
2007-11-04T12:24:00.000Z	m0u5e		is that weird or what?
2007-11-04T12:25:00.000Z	sandaru1	m0u5e	the best option would be download, compile and install newest alsa version
2007-11-04T12:25:00.000Z	sandaru1	m0u5e	1.0.15
2007-11-04T12:27:00.000Z	m0u5e	sandaru1	do you know if it's an alsa problem?
2007-11-04T12:28:00.000Z	m0u5e		compiling the newest version won't do anything if the problem doesn't even lie in alsa
2007-11-04T12:28:00.000Z	m0u5e		how would "re" modprobe my intel drivers
2007-11-04T12:28:00.000Z	m0u5e		preferably, let it decide what it should use itself
2007-11-04T12:30:00.000Z	sandaru1	m0u5e	there is pretty much no option other than compiling alsa :p
2007-11-04T12:31:00.000Z	m0u5e		sandaru: what about modprobing ... i think i might have screwed up something there
2007-11-04T12:31:00.000Z	m0u5e	sandaru1	is there a way to reset that?
2007-11-04T12:32:00.000Z	sandaru1	m0u5e	check /etc/modprobe.d/.. i'm not pretty much familiar with it
