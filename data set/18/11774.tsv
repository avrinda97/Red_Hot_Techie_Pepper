2006-08-11T08:33:00.000Z	Raito		you can have gnome and KDE at the same time
2006-08-11T08:33:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Raito	You dont need the kubuntu desktop..
2006-08-11T08:33:00.000Z	Raito	Jack_Sparrow	You don't?
2006-08-11T08:34:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Raito	Do you want to just run some of the apps or KDE as in the desktop manager?
2006-08-11T08:34:00.000Z	Raito	Jack_Sparrow	Oh, I was meaning KDE as the desktop manager without getting rid of gnome >_<
2006-08-11T08:35:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Raito	you can have both and select yes..
2006-08-11T08:35:00.000Z	Raito	Jack_Sparrow	I apologize, anyways that is what I do anyway
2006-08-11T08:36:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Raito	That is tricky...
2006-08-11T08:36:00.000Z	Raito	Jack_Sparrow	Uh-oh, how would you do it though?
2006-08-11T08:37:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Raito	I would try  the super grub repair disk and see if it will not setup both 2 and 4 then delte
2006-08-11T08:37:00.000Z	Raito	Jack_Sparrow	What is the super grub repair disk? Is there no way to do it with the ubuntu liveCD?
2006-08-11T08:38:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Raito	I dont think the live will do what you want..
2006-08-11T08:39:00.000Z	Raito	Jack_Sparrow	Oh my, so where might I find this super grub disk? It better not be a floppy, I don't have a floppy drive
