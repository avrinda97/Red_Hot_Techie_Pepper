2011-11-11T20:02:00.000Z	Crazy		hello everyone,can i creat different file systems under one  partition ,and the partition was separated by me under the whole disks
2011-11-11T20:03:00.000Z	riffautae	Crazy	do you mean, make one partition for ubuntu on the hard drive and then have linux break that into multiple in a higher layer??
2011-11-11T20:03:00.000Z	riffautae	Crazy	sorry about the extra '?' there
2011-11-11T20:04:00.000Z	Crazy	riffautae	i mean that the partition was just a part of the whole disks ,and i want install another linux system in that partition
2011-11-11T20:05:00.000Z	riffautae	Crazy	sorrry i dont know what 'whole disks' is
2011-11-11T20:06:00.000Z	Crazy	riffautae	yes
2011-11-11T20:06:00.000Z	Crazy	riffautae	thats it
2011-11-11T20:07:00.000Z	riffautae	Crazy	so you want to install linux on one big partition?
2011-11-11T20:07:00.000Z	Crazy	riffautae	yes thats it
2011-11-11T20:07:00.000Z	Crazy	riffautae	can i?
2011-11-11T20:08:00.000Z	riffautae	Crazy	yes when installing choose custom partitions and make one large one, then tell it to mount it as '/'. later you will have to look up how to make swap a file intead of a partition
2011-11-11T20:09:00.000Z	riffautae	Crazy	the other option is to make one large partition and install lvm on top, then you can change and resize partitions how ever you want and other os's will just see it as one mystery partition
2011-11-11T20:12:00.000Z	Crazy	riffautae	when i mount it as '/', how can i create a swap file system
2011-11-11T20:13:00.000Z	riffautae	Crazy	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SwapFaq this has a section talking about swap as a file, its not a header item so youll have to look through to find it
2011-11-11T20:14:00.000Z	Crazy	riffautae	thank you
2011-11-11T20:48:00.000Z	Crazy	riffautae	hello , thank you for your advice about the swap , but now i wonder the /boot , how can i create the /boot and mount it under the '/' ,using "dd" ??
2011-11-11T20:49:00.000Z	riffautae	Crazy	no need for a separate boot if you make your one big partition /
2011-11-11T20:50:00.000Z	Crazy	riffautae	ok ,  thank you very much
