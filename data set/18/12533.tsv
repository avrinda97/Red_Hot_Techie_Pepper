2006-04-07T14:37:00.000Z	DBO		sorry annie_ i just had to make sure, ok
2006-04-07T14:37:00.000Z	DBO		on one of the boxes
2006-04-07T14:38:00.000Z	DBO		ok, so it must be running...
2006-04-07T14:38:00.000Z	DBO		hmmm, it should be able to connect...
2006-04-07T14:39:00.000Z	DBO		other than "grep sshd"
2006-04-07T14:40:00.000Z	DBO		pastebin the output please
2006-04-07T14:42:00.000Z	DBO		!paste
2006-04-07T14:43:00.000Z	roryy	DBO	afaik each client connection results in a new sshd process (or perhaps thread? not sure)
2006-04-07T14:44:00.000Z	DBO	roryy	I didnt think each client resulted in a new deamon process on the server...
2006-04-07T14:44:00.000Z	DBO	roryy	plus she says she cant connect
2006-04-07T14:44:00.000Z	roryy	DBO	i think it forks off a process for each connection. I'm 75% sure about this ;)
2006-04-12T14:51:00.000Z	roryy	DBO	'export CC' or 'export CC=gcc-3.4'
2006-05-05T11:14:00.000Z	DBO	roryy	nope, same kernel
2006-05-05T11:14:00.000Z	roryy	DBO	hrm, you sure? I installed server-edition last year, and i remember being surprised at having a non -386 kernel image
2006-05-05T11:15:00.000Z	roryy	DBO	note this is the server edition cd, not normal cd with 'server' install
2006-05-26T12:37:00.000Z	DBO	roryy	its the other way around
2006-05-26T12:40:00.000Z	DBO	roryy	wow... all this time Ive been wasting a keypress
