2008-08-05T19:05:00.000Z	naxxtor	blackpen	with route
2008-08-05T19:05:00.000Z	naxxtor	blackpen	what are you trying to achieve?
2008-08-05T19:05:00.000Z	blackpen	naxxtor	i need to install some sort of network monitoring tool like ksniffer
2008-08-05T19:07:00.000Z	naxxtor	blackpen	you just sniffing traffic?  can't you use wireshark or something like that?
2008-08-05T19:07:00.000Z	blackpen	naxxtor	i dont know. im very new to this. but it;'s time sensitive so im looking for the fastest option here
2008-08-05T19:08:00.000Z	naxxtor	blackpen	i'd grab wireshark if you want to sniff packets, or something like iptraf if you want to gather statistics on connections
2008-08-05T19:08:00.000Z	blackpen	naxxtor	i want to read text and what is being sent over the network.
2008-08-05T19:08:00.000Z	naxxtor	blackpen	wireshark it is then
2008-08-05T19:09:00.000Z	blackpen	naxxtor	does it hav e a nice gui?
2008-08-05T19:09:00.000Z	naxxtor	blackpen	yep, nice colourful gtk gui :)
2008-08-05T19:10:00.000Z	blackpen	naxxtor	great.. now. ive got 2 nics in this server..  how to i set this up so i can utilize this software?
2008-08-05T19:10:00.000Z	naxxtor	blackpen	if you're putting your machine in between the two, make sure ip_forwarding is enabled
2008-08-05T19:11:00.000Z	blackpen	naxxtor	my machine is in between the wall and the router..  where is ip_forwarding set?
2008-08-05T19:11:00.000Z	naxxtor	blackpen	echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
2008-08-05T19:12:00.000Z	naxxtor	blackpen	something like route add 192.168.0.1 -i eth0 # where eth0 is the interface your router is on
2008-08-05T19:13:00.000Z	blackpen	naxxtor	my ip_forward file is totally blank.. except for one '0'
2008-08-05T19:17:00.000Z	naxxtor	blackpen	it should have a 0 if it's disabled ... that's why i said to echo 1 to it :)
