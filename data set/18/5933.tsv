2008-07-31T14:06:00.000Z	cwillu	Rutz	are you running with desktop effects enabled?
2008-07-31T14:06:00.000Z	cwillu	Rutz	windows has had a very light form of compositing forever, which does make things like exposes feel way way faster
2008-07-31T14:06:00.000Z	Rutz	cwillu	no, I have disabled all fancy stuf I could
2008-07-31T14:07:00.000Z	cwillu	Rutz	enabling desktop effects, or running xcompmgr (although it's sketchy) will improve the subjective performance
2008-07-31T14:07:00.000Z	Rutz	cwillu	what do you measn. do you say 'it seems faster' ? :)
2008-07-31T14:14:00.000Z	cwillu	Rutz	text files can be version controlled :p
2008-07-31T14:15:00.000Z	Rutz	cwillu	meaning?
2008-07-31T14:20:00.000Z	cwillu	Rutz	by default, x doesn't cache the contents of windows, so it you drag one window over top another, and then bring the back one back up front, it'll have to redraw the window.  The worst case is when you drag a window over and back, as you'll see it redraw a slice at a time
2008-07-31T14:20:00.000Z	cwillu	Rutz	windows does cache the contents however, and so can just blit the old contents back over top.  any compositing manager will also gain the same benefit
2008-07-31T14:22:00.000Z	Rutz	cwillu	didn't quite understand what you are trying to say.
2008-07-31T14:22:00.000Z	cwillu	Rutz	are you running desktop effects == None?
2008-07-31T14:22:00.000Z	Rutz	cwillu	yes
2008-07-31T14:22:00.000Z	Rutz	cwillu	and?
2008-07-31T14:23:00.000Z	Rutz	cwillu	hey, why do I need this, I didn't express concerns about anything like that:)
2008-07-31T14:24:00.000Z	cwillu	Rutz	it's a subjective performance improvement
2008-07-31T14:24:00.000Z	Rutz	cwillu	so?
2008-07-31T14:24:00.000Z	cwillu	Rutz	seeing an application not updating it's screen after being obscured has a documented effect on the perceived performance :p
2008-07-31T14:25:00.000Z	Rutz	cwillu	does it have anything to do with starting an application when it wasn't running???
