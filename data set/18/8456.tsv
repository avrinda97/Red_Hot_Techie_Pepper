2007-08-17T05:28:00.000Z	Overdrive		hi, i'm trying to install some basic packages in ubuntu 64 bits version, but i can't find the major part of packages :-/
2007-08-17T05:28:00.000Z	Overdrive		(like emacs, xorg, etc...)
2007-08-17T05:28:00.000Z	Pici	Overdrive	Where are you looking?
2007-08-17T05:28:00.000Z	Overdrive	Pici	i'm using apt-cache search emacs e.g. and nothing :-/
2007-08-17T05:29:00.000Z	Overdrive	Pici	i imagine that the major part of packages are not ported to 64 bits version, btw i'm trying to configure if not exist the package to ia64, try to install to ia32
2007-08-17T05:30:00.000Z	Pici	Overdrive	Thats odd, Have you done an apt-get update lately?
2007-08-17T05:31:00.000Z	Overdrive	Pici	oh right :-)
2007-08-17T05:37:00.000Z	Overdrive	Pici	really i install amd64 bits ubuntu version, is the same for intel 64 bits version right?
2007-08-17T05:37:00.000Z	Pici	Overdrive	Yes.
2007-08-17T05:37:00.000Z	Overdrive	Pici	ok thanks :-) sorry but is my first computer in 64 bits and i'm lost in some options :-)
2007-08-17T05:41:00.000Z	Overdrive	Pici	maybe is a question half offtopic, but linux kernel supports 100% quad core? ubuntu detects the 4 cores... but i don't know if the support is full or not...
2007-08-17T05:41:00.000Z	Pici	Overdrive	I'm really not sure, sorry.
2007-08-17T05:44:00.000Z	Overdrive	Pici	i know, but my question was, if it is possible use root account and not normal account + sudo
2007-08-17T05:45:00.000Z	Pici	Overdrive	Hm, I thought information about re-enabling root was in that link, but I must be mistaken.
2007-08-17T05:46:00.000Z	Overdrive	Pici	ok, i'm going to read!! :-)
2007-08-17T05:46:00.000Z	Pici	Overdrive	You can do `sudo passwd` to set a password for root. But as you know, we dont like to suggest that. :)
2007-08-17T05:47:00.000Z	Overdrive	Pici	is only to know how to do :-P
2007-08-17T05:50:00.000Z	Overdrive	Pici	is incredible faster quad core in ubuntu launching xorg+gnome :-/
