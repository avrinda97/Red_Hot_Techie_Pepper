2011-02-11T06:43:00.000Z	gogeta1	psusi	my atom is hyperthreded heh doesent mean its a dule core
2011-02-11T06:43:00.000Z	psusi	gogeta1	hence the pseudo part
2011-02-11T06:44:00.000Z	gogeta1	psusi	my 64 bit amd dule core also hyperthreded leave my atom in the dust but pcs for diffrent uses
2011-02-11T06:45:00.000Z	psusi	gogeta1	hyperthreading is an intel thing.. amd didn't do it
2011-02-11T06:45:00.000Z	gogeta1	psusi	tell that to my amd being it does it
2011-02-11T06:45:00.000Z	psusi		amd just went for actual dual core
2011-02-11T06:45:00.000Z	psusi		no, it actually has dual cores ;)
2011-02-11T06:45:00.000Z	gogeta1	psusi	hes hyper threded dule core shows as 4
2011-02-11T06:45:00.000Z	gogeta1		yes
2011-02-11T06:47:00.000Z	psusi		afaik, amd never did anything like hyperthreading, they just went to actual dual cores... none of my amd boxes ever had anything like that anyhow...
2011-02-11T06:47:00.000Z	gogeta1	psusi	yea amd made there own version as he said but they tend not to boast it rather just make more real cores like the phenom 6 core
2011-02-11T06:48:00.000Z	psusi		of course that was two physical packages...
2011-02-11T06:49:00.000Z	gogeta1	psusi	probly why the hyperporssing dule cores ddnt come around till like 2 years ago
2011-02-11T06:50:00.000Z	psusi		hyperthreading was a cheap gimick stop gap measure to get some of the benefits of multi core without actually making a whole second core... there's no reason to add it now
2011-02-11T06:50:00.000Z	gogeta1	psusi	hey i just said they did i ddint say why
2011-02-11T06:50:00.000Z	psusi		goofy... hrm... guess my athlon64 5000+ black edition was a little older than that
2011-02-11T06:51:00.000Z	gogeta1	psusi	im running a ql-65
2011-02-11T06:54:00.000Z	gogeta1	psusi	yea i wasent expecting it to have i assumed it didnt being it was amd they they tend to shoot for real cores
