2009-11-03T06:42:00.000Z	mbeierl		anyone know if there is a way of performing the nvidia-settings tweaking of external displays from the command line?
2009-11-03T06:43:00.000Z	jbuncher	mbeierl	I think what you want is nvidia-xconfig, though I'm not sure.
2009-11-03T06:43:00.000Z	mbeierl	jbuncher	I don't want to rewrite the xconfig, I'd like to toggle the external monitor without having to invoke the nvidia-settings gui and clicking a bunch...
2009-11-03T06:44:00.000Z	mbeierl	jbuncher	thanks, either way, though
2009-11-03T06:44:00.000Z	jbuncher	mbeierl	what do you mean by "toggle the external monitor"?
2009-11-03T06:45:00.000Z	mbeierl	jbuncher	turn external monitor on laptop on and off (dual monitor when docked, single when undocked)
2009-11-03T06:46:00.000Z	jbuncher	mbeierl	ah, ok.  I don't know if there's anything like that for nvidia, unless they support the xrandr extensions.  I don't think that works if you've set up the monitors through xinerama though.
2009-11-03T06:46:00.000Z	mbeierl	jbuncher	I've not used xinerama, just the nvidia twinview config
2009-11-03T06:47:00.000Z	jbuncher	mbeierl	ok.  Just read the nvidia docs and the xrandr docs I guess, that's all the info I have.
2009-11-03T06:47:00.000Z	mbeierl	jbuncher	thanks... that
2009-11-03T06:48:00.000Z	mbeierl	jbuncher	that's where I'm hitting a wall...
2009-11-03T06:54:00.000Z	mbeierl	jbuncher	"disper" is what I wanted :)   http://willem.engen.nl/projects/disper/
2009-11-03T06:55:00.000Z	jbuncher	mbeierl	thanks for the info, I'll keep that in mind :)
2009-11-03T06:56:00.000Z	mbeierl	jbuncher	I just came across it, have been using xrandr and nvidia's meta-modes in xorg.conf for a few years now.  This is much better.
2009-11-03T06:58:00.000Z	jbuncher	mbeierl	yeah, crazy nvidia and their meta modes.  Found out about those when I was wondering why in the world my card/monitor was only working at 50 Hz.  Just crazy nvidia trickery.
2009-11-03T06:58:00.000Z	mbeierl	jbuncher	ah yes, the "use the refresh rate to make xrandr modes appear unique" trick.
2009-11-03T06:59:00.000Z	jbuncher	mbeierl	yeah.  It's sad that for good 3d on linux you need to used closed drivers that pull that kind of nonsense.  I hope that hte open ATI ones get much better soon, or the nouveux guys get a lot of help.
2009-11-03T07:00:00.000Z	mbeierl	jbuncher	well... here's hoping :)
