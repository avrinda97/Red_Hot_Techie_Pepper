2006-07-10T08:28:00.000Z	Cntryboy26		when someone pings you, what port is that using?
2006-07-10T08:29:00.000Z	Cntryboy26		okay but wouldn't that still use a port?
2006-07-10T08:31:00.000Z	Cntryboy26		ash-fox: then with firestarter how can I stealth or block out imcp echo request, to futher hide my pc?
2006-07-10T08:33:00.000Z	Cntryboy26		ash-fox: can I msg you so I can talk to u about hiding this imcp thingy
2006-07-10T08:33:00.000Z	Cntryboy26		ok
2006-07-10T08:33:00.000Z	Ash-Fox	Cntryboy26	I've never used firestarter.
2006-07-10T08:33:00.000Z	Cntryboy26		thx raptros
2006-07-10T08:34:00.000Z	Ash-Fox		I've only used firewall admin, which is a php script which plays with iptables.
2006-07-10T08:34:00.000Z	Cntryboy26	raptros-v76	in prefer. for imcp should I check all those boxes or just imcp echo
2006-07-10T08:35:00.000Z	Ash-Fox		becareful, block all ICMP, and you won't be able to get your computer to auto configure it self on DHCP/BOOTP networks afer
2006-07-10T08:35:00.000Z	Ash-Fox		*after.
2006-07-10T08:35:00.000Z	Cntryboy26	raptros-v76	is it a good idea to enable filtering for the others?
2006-07-10T08:36:00.000Z	Cntryboy26		is ctcp-ping on irc differ from imcp echo?
2006-07-10T08:36:00.000Z	Ash-Fox	Cntryboy26	yes.
2006-07-10T08:36:00.000Z	Ash-Fox	Cntryboy26	CTCP pings use.. CTCP. ICMP pings use.. ICMP
2006-07-10T08:36:00.000Z	Cntryboy26		k
2006-07-10T08:36:00.000Z	Cntryboy26		ash-fox what did you mean about the computer want auto configure itself?
2006-07-10T08:37:00.000Z	Ash-Fox	Cntryboy26	autoconfiguring for networks using DHCP/BOOTP will not be possible if you block certain ICMP codes.
