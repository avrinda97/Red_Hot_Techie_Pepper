2005-03-23T11:25:00.000Z	Absenth	laggerzero	well then, it's possible I completely hosed up my computer jsut now :)
2005-03-23T11:39:00.000Z	laggerzero	Absenth	i'm with you
2005-03-23T11:46:00.000Z	Absenth	laggerzero	if you're looking for fun debian like things to play with, check out Progeny
2005-03-23T11:47:00.000Z	Absenth	laggerzero	I only know Progeny exists because they are local, and half the local lug works there.
2005-03-23T11:48:00.000Z	laggerzero	Absenth	does it use xorg?
2005-03-23T11:49:00.000Z	Absenth	laggerzero	depends on which way you decide to go with progeny.  their claim to fame is "compartmentalized linux"  you choose what core packages you want, and they deal with the dependency hell.
2005-03-23T11:49:00.000Z	Absenth	laggerzero	in all reality it's a LSB 2.0 compatible debian sarge offshoot.
2005-03-23T11:50:00.000Z	Absenth	laggerzero	Sleep is a totally inapporpriate substitute for Caffeine.
