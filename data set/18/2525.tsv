2010-05-23T10:35:00.000Z	Loshki	tvaughn	time to use smartctl to look at the SMART data for the disk and see if it looks healthy....
2010-05-23T10:35:00.000Z	tvaughn	Loshki	it better be its a brand new disk
2010-05-23T10:36:00.000Z	Loshki	tvaughn	even new disks sometimes develop problems. Best to find out now while it's still under warranty. The data is worth more than the disk usually anyway...
2010-05-23T10:37:00.000Z	tvaughn	Loshki	can fsck try to fix it/
2010-05-23T10:38:00.000Z	Loshki	tvaughn	well disks will reallocate bad sectors automatically. It sounds like yours did that. But failing sectors on a new disk is a bad sign. Hence the SMART check...
2010-05-23T10:39:00.000Z	tvaughn	Loshki	so i should definatly return it?
2010-05-23T10:39:00.000Z	Loshki	tvaughn	what brand/model of disk is it?
2010-05-23T10:40:00.000Z	tvaughn	Loshki	western digital caviler
2010-05-23T10:40:00.000Z	Loshki	tvaughn	and what size?
2010-05-23T10:41:00.000Z	Loshki	tvaughn	I ask because the 1.5TBs haven't been as reliable (in my experience). How does the SMART data look? Maybe you should run a long test overnight before you decide?
2010-05-23T10:42:00.000Z	tvaughn	Loshki	everything else is fine just the 4 sectors pending relocation
2010-05-23T10:44:00.000Z	tvaughn	Loshki	I bought it on the 8th of this month
2010-05-23T10:46:00.000Z	Loshki	tvaughn	I'm not sure, but I don't recall any of my disks reallocating sectors so early in their lifetime. If you can return it and get a replacement without a restocking fee, I'd consider it. Consider asking on #hardware maybe for a second opinion...
2010-05-23T10:47:00.000Z	tvaughn	Loshki	if i do how can I backup this install of ubuntu thats on it
2010-05-23T10:59:00.000Z	tvaughn	Loshki	if the file opens ok doesnt that mean it was a temporary problem? the people in hardware are too busy talkinga bout drugs
2010-05-23T11:02:00.000Z	Loshki	tvaughn	I can see I'm obviously in the wrong channel. The issue is that over time, disks tend to develop bad sectors and reallocate them. Eventually, they run out of spare sectors and then the disk is no longer reliable. My concern is that your disk is rather young to be developing it's first bad sectors. It could be a one-off, in which case it's fine, or the beginning of a trend because you got a bad one. I would use smartd to monitor
