2006-10-13T10:53:00.000Z	soundray	XsesA	Congrats
2006-10-13T10:55:00.000Z	soundray	XsesA	try these instructions: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows
2006-10-13T11:24:00.000Z	soundray	XsesA	have you tried to reinstall grub as per the instructions?
2006-10-13T11:26:00.000Z	soundray	XsesA	it may do, but every reasonable person here will ask you to reinstall grub before you do any other fault searching.
2006-10-13T11:41:00.000Z	soundray	XsesA	what happened after you reinstalled grub?
2006-10-13T11:41:00.000Z	soundray	XsesA	did you do a full shutdown in windows?
2006-10-13T11:42:00.000Z	soundray	XsesA	I've told you. The instructions are in...
2006-10-13T11:42:00.000Z	soundray	XsesA	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows
2006-10-13T11:42:00.000Z	XsesA	soundray	i did what it said there
2006-10-13T11:43:00.000Z	soundray	XsesA	oh, so you put Ubuntu on the second hard disk?
2006-10-13T11:44:00.000Z	soundray	XsesA	you will have to install grub to the first hard disk, nevertheless.
2006-10-13T11:45:00.000Z	soundray	XsesA	so "setup (hd0)" is the command you need.
2006-10-13T12:00:00.000Z	soundray	XsesA	be patient.
2006-10-13T12:00:00.000Z	soundray	XsesA	hd0, like I said earlier.
