2012-05-18T23:28:00.000Z	bxnub		woops, this isnt my terminal
2012-05-18T23:29:00.000Z	theadmin	bxnub	Hehe... Set a different color theme in one of them :P
2012-05-18T23:30:00.000Z	theadmin	bxnub	What do you mean, "differently"?
2012-05-18T23:30:00.000Z	bxnub	theadmin	the last VPS I had, I never had an issue installing/compiling this
2012-05-18T23:31:00.000Z	theadmin	bxnub	Do you have base-devel installed?
2012-05-18T23:31:00.000Z	theadmin	bxnub	Err, scratch that, build-essential
2012-05-18T23:31:00.000Z	bxnub	theadmin	yes
2012-05-18T23:32:00.000Z	bxnub	theadmin	I'm talking about this like this; http://i.imgur.com/l1Lf9.png
2012-05-18T23:33:00.000Z	theadmin	bxnub	Some huge dependency problem. Try using aptitude instead of apt-get, it resolves dependencies much better most of the time
2012-05-18T23:34:00.000Z	bxnub	theadmin	http://i.imgur.com/nfqCt.png <- this is what I get, and accepting the solution didn't fix a thing
2012-05-18T23:35:00.000Z	theadmin	bxnub	Do you have any third-party repositories? Did you update the indices before attempting installation?
2012-05-18T23:36:00.000Z	bxnub	theadmin	yes, and I don't know what that means :p
2012-05-18T23:36:00.000Z	theadmin	bxnub	The latter one? It means "did you run 'sudo apt-get update'?"
2012-05-18T23:37:00.000Z	bxnub	theadmin	yes, many times :P
2012-05-18T23:37:00.000Z	theadmin	bxnub	Well, there is no official support for any third-party repositories. Try removing them first, fully upgrading your system, after which seeing if installation succeeds again.
2012-05-18T23:37:00.000Z	bxnub	theadmin	why is there a rather large quantity of jaunty repositories on my hardy install?
2012-05-18T23:38:00.000Z	theadmin	bxnub	I'm not sure, there shouldn't be any by default, and mixing releases *is* a bad idea
