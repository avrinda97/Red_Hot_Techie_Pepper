2007-08-29T09:51:00.000Z	Dufresne26^	Carroarmato0	its working now. reinstalling the restricted modules did the trick
2007-08-29T09:51:00.000Z	Carroarmato0	Dufresne26^	hurray! ^O^
2007-08-29T09:52:00.000Z	Dufresne26^	Carroarmato0	:)
2007-08-29T09:53:00.000Z	Carroarmato0	Dufresne26^	Good news for me too... testing my usb wireless card..an Asus... It's supported completely with WPE in Gutsy :P
2007-08-29T09:55:00.000Z	Dufresne26^	Carroarmato0	awesome! Gutsy huh? can't wait to try it myself. Btw, do you by any chance have any ideas how to get my pcmcia tv tuner to work in feisty?
2007-08-29T09:55:00.000Z	Carroarmato0	Dufresne26^	hmm I don't have any experience with those... srry
2007-08-29T09:56:00.000Z	Carroarmato0	Dufresne26^	But I'm a tester for Gutsy.. It's coming up pretty good...
2007-08-29T09:56:00.000Z	Dufresne26^	Carroarmato0	thanks. i bet that'll be another wild goose chase
2007-08-29T09:56:00.000Z	Carroarmato0	Dufresne26^	lol
2007-08-29T10:00:00.000Z	Dufresne26^	Carroarmato0	r u testing new hardware on Gutsy?
2007-08-29T10:01:00.000Z	Carroarmato0	Dufresne26^	euhm no I'm just hunting for bugs in usability and stuff... but I limit to trying out stuff that I have and use daily
2007-08-29T10:03:00.000Z	Carroarmato0	Dufresne26^	It's in Gutsy alright... but they limit the options... it's ok though.. but I'd like to see a few more kick ass feature by default... however you can activate everything by installing the configurator ^^
2007-08-29T10:04:00.000Z	Carroarmato0	Dufresne26^	It's really smooth even on the live-cd session with everything enabled what Gutsy offers as default.. am using intel video card.. and I loke what I see ^^
2007-08-29T10:05:00.000Z	Dufresne26^	Carroarmato0	maybe I'll try to run the unstable in feisty. the screencasts' kick @$$
2007-08-29T10:05:00.000Z	Carroarmato0	Dufresne26^	Ow but you can just give the live-cd a spin... or install it in VMware
2007-08-29T10:07:00.000Z	Dufresne26^	Carroarmato0	good idea. That way I can check the other stuff Gutsy has (including bugs)
2007-08-29T10:09:00.000Z	Carroarmato0	Dufresne26^	Some things don't work while the live-cd is running... like installing a printer... Those thing usualy work for now only when it's installed
2007-08-29T10:11:00.000Z	Dufresne26^	Carroarmato0	well, seeing as how my printer isn't working well in itself, I'm sure that won't be a problem :)
