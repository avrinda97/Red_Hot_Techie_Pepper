2008-07-13T02:37:00.000Z	Morrowyn		does anyone how ext3 shows my old data instead my new data?
2008-07-13T02:38:00.000Z	Morrowyn		i just rebooted and got my entire old filesystem structure back (deleted/removed files and directories,  newly added files and directories are gone)
2008-07-13T02:39:00.000Z	Morrowyn		installed system, running for ages
2008-07-13T02:39:00.000Z	Morrowyn		ext3 fs
2008-07-13T02:39:00.000Z	Morrowyn		a week ago a rearranged the entire drive
2008-07-13T02:39:00.000Z	Morrowyn		and now all changed are reverted as if ive never made any
2008-07-13T02:40:00.000Z	Morrowyn		which means, i lost a lot of data
2008-07-13T02:40:00.000Z	Morrowyn		in anycase, this will be a serious deal break on linux
2008-07-13T02:40:00.000Z	Morrowyn		breaker^
2008-07-13T02:40:00.000Z	td123	Morrowyn	what did you do?
2008-07-13T02:49:00.000Z	td123	Morrowyn	well maybe if you described in very great detail what you did, maybe we can help you more
2008-07-13T02:55:00.000Z	td123	Morrowyn	Post something on the forums and maybe you'll have better luck there, don't give up if the files are meaningful to you
2008-07-13T03:03:00.000Z	td123	Morrowyn	have you ever rebooted during the time you changed your layout and the time you started to notice the layout was back to the original (have you ever did a dirty shutdown during this time?)
2008-07-13T03:04:00.000Z	td123	Morrowyn	did you reboot and see the same structure?
2008-07-13T03:05:00.000Z	td123	Morrowyn	what fs type are you using ext3?
2008-07-13T03:07:00.000Z	td123	Morrowyn	try http://www.linuxforums.org/forum/linux-security/13416-ext3-filesystem-can-undelete-work.html
2008-07-13T03:15:00.000Z	td123	Morrowyn	have you tried to undelete the files you lost
2008-07-13T03:17:00.000Z	Morrowyn	td123	cant remember to undelete stuff, my entire filesystem dates from june 20th, so i reckon, my current file journal is busted and i switched back to the last "good" one, which was june20th somehow
