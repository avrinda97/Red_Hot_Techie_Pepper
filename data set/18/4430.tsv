2009-05-02T06:59:00.000Z	abama		use stty to set /dev/ttyS0, then echo xxx > /dev/ttyS0,  but how to read the response from /dev/ttyS0?
2009-05-02T06:59:00.000Z	muelli	abama	use "cat"
2009-05-02T07:00:00.000Z	muelli	abama	or "dd"
2009-05-02T07:00:00.000Z	abama	muelli	use cat, then when to return?
2009-05-02T07:04:00.000Z	abama	muelli	not only one line to be echoed to /dev/ttyS0, after it reads the return. then echo next line to /dev/ttyS0
2009-05-02T07:04:00.000Z	muelli	abama	what? I didn't understand what you were trying to tell me.
2009-05-02T07:09:00.000Z	abama	muelli	like these, echo abc > /dev/ttyS0, read from /dev/ttyS0 and check the return result, then echo defgh > /dev/ttyS0, repeat these action
2009-05-02T07:10:00.000Z	muelli	abama	I'd write a small python script.
2009-05-02T07:11:00.000Z	abama	muelli	you can get those through python script?
2009-05-02T07:16:00.000Z	abama	muelli	there is other way to do that, not familiar with python
2009-05-02T07:20:00.000Z	abama	muelli	it needs to ctrl+C to terminate the read from /dev/ttyS0?
2009-05-02T07:21:00.000Z	muelli	abama	cat does. dd does unless you specify how many bytes it should read.
2009-05-02T07:24:00.000Z	abama	muelli	but i want to use it in script
2009-05-02T07:24:00.000Z	muelli	abama	so?
2009-05-02T07:26:00.000Z	abama	muelli	read /dev/ttyS0, specify the number of bytes to read, how to do that?
2009-05-02T07:26:00.000Z	muelli	abama	use dd.
2009-05-02T07:26:00.000Z	muelli	abama	or python ;-)
2009-05-02T07:28:00.000Z	muelli	abama	in fact, you can use somethg like "python -c 'file("/dev/ttyS0").readline()' in order to read a line. or file().read(10) to read 10 bytes
