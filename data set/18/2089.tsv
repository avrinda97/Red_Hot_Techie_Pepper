2012-05-09T19:04:00.000Z	RingZer0		trying to switch fron win to ubuntu - when booting off the cd (dvd) all i see is a blinking horizontal cursor.  But I hear the infamous startup sound that plays after initial load.
2012-05-09T19:05:00.000Z	RingZer0		but no visual other than blinkign cursor.
2012-05-09T19:05:00.000Z	RingZer0		I tried to install linux mint as an alternative to ubuntu, but it froze on firewire fw0 detection/initialization
2012-05-09T19:05:00.000Z	RingZer0		thoughts?
2012-05-09T19:06:00.000Z	RingZer0		from the second I boot from the CD, i see nothing.
2012-05-09T19:06:00.000Z	ome	RingZer0	what is you machine ?
2012-05-09T19:06:00.000Z	RingZer0	ome	custom build.
2012-05-09T19:07:00.000Z	ome	RingZer0	so, I assume it's good enough to run ubuntu. then I specs wouldn't help much.
2012-05-09T19:09:00.000Z	ome	RingZer0	did you try to restart the 'xorg' from a a tty terminal ?

2012-05-09T19:10:00.000Z	ome	RingZer0	ok, when you bootup and hear the startup sound, press ALT+F1. and let me know if you can see a terminal. I will help you further.
2012-05-09T19:10:00.000Z	RingZer0	ome	okay, i tried ctrl+alt F1-F8
2012-05-09T19:13:00.000Z	ome	RingZer0	did you try the same 'CD' in some other machine ? I am not sure but it could be that you graphic card is bit exotic.
