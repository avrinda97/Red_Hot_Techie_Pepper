2008-01-05T07:09:00.000Z	skjdfgh	Pelo	Hi, sorry, I got disconnected as mikebot.
2008-01-05T07:09:00.000Z	skjdfgh	Pelo	And it looks like I was reconnected, but this computer is much more stable.
2008-01-05T07:10:00.000Z	Pelo	skjdfgh	 ok , extract the iso to the desktop, inside the extracted folder there is the video_ts folder,  copy that to the dvd as you would any data using gnomebaker and you will have a working dvd
2008-01-05T07:10:00.000Z	skjdfgh	Pelo	SO I don't need the .. file? It seems all my isos have that.
2008-01-05T07:10:00.000Z	Pelo	skjdfgh	those are just extra data for the progs that make and use iso they are not part of the actual data
2008-01-05T07:11:00.000Z	skjdfgh	Pelo	OK, it's still extracting, so I'll try it in one second. Thanks for the help.
2008-01-05T07:11:00.000Z	Pelo	skjdfgh	it can take several minuts to extract 4 gig of data, like 30 of them or more
2008-01-05T07:12:00.000Z	skjdfgh	Pelo	Yikes, OK, I'll let you know when it finishes.
2008-01-05T07:12:00.000Z	skjdfgh	Pelo	Oh, also, is there any reason for k9copy to have problems converting a dvd to an iso?
2008-01-05T07:13:00.000Z	Pelo	skjdfgh	no idea , never used it
2008-01-05T07:13:00.000Z	Pelo	skjdfgh	dvd encryption might be an issue
2008-01-05T07:13:00.000Z	skjdfgh	Pelo	I was under the impression that if a computer could open a dvd then it was already decrypting it.
2008-01-05T07:13:00.000Z	skjdfgh	Pelo	Do you use anythign for this process?
2008-01-05T07:14:00.000Z	Pelo	skjdfgh	if you can read it in the comp you shoudl be find,  your original question was very general
2008-01-05T07:14:00.000Z	skjdfgh	Pelo	OK, I guess I'll try it again.
2008-01-05T07:15:00.000Z	skjdfgh	Pelo	So I'm making a new data DVD and just having the video_ts folder as the data?
2008-01-05T07:15:00.000Z	Pelo	skjdfgh	yes
2008-01-05T07:17:00.000Z	skjdfgh	Pelo	OK, I'll try that, thanks.
