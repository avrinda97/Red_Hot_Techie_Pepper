2008-01-06T04:56:00.000Z	OD810	arizalord	System -> Administration -> Screen & Graphics
2008-01-06T04:57:00.000Z	arizalord	OD810	yes, but my optimal resolution does not appear!
2008-01-06T04:58:00.000Z	OD810	arizalord	i'm in that problem as well, are you using ATI card with restricted driver?
2008-01-06T04:58:00.000Z	arizalord	OD810	yes!
2008-01-06T04:58:00.000Z	OD810	arizalord	I've been googling for days but couldnt get around it
2008-01-06T05:02:00.000Z	OD810	arizalord	are you with the latest ATI driver?
2008-01-06T05:02:00.000Z	OD810	arizalord	there's a bug with the new driver, it's only work with 1280x1024 max resolution
2008-01-06T05:03:00.000Z	arizalord	OD810	1280x768 to?
2008-01-06T05:03:00.000Z	arizalord	OD810	1280x768 too?
2008-01-06T05:04:00.000Z	OD810	arizalord	i reckon we should revert to the older driver
