2010-11-25T05:34:00.000Z	djwattz		do u have an idea how i can fix it
2010-11-25T05:34:00.000Z	muelli	djwattz	yes. Move the offending file to /tmp/.
2010-11-25T05:31:00.000Z	djwattz	muelli	how do i do that?
2010-11-25T05:32:00.000Z	muelli	djwattz	how did you do that in first place? And why? Don't tamper with that system stuff unless you know what you're doing. In your case, you can simply move the offending file to /tmp/.
2010-11-25T05:34:00.000Z	muelli	djwattz	now you hear that it's a problem with your modifications to the package management.
2010-11-25T05:39:00.000Z	muelli	djwattz	one last time: Move that file out to /tmp/.
2010-11-25T05:40:00.000Z	djwattz	muelli	sorry what was the file i had to move to tmp
2010-11-25T05:48:00.000Z	djwattz	muelli	it wont move it just moakes a copy of its self
2010-11-25T05:49:00.000Z	muelli	djwattz	... open a terminal, do "sudo mv $filename /tmp/".
2010-11-25T05:53:00.000Z	djwattz	muelli	i did  "sudo mv $ubuntu-tweak-stable.list.d /tmp/
2010-11-25T05:54:00.000Z	muelli	djwattz	Good :) But don't do the dollar in front. And put the full file name there.
2010-11-25T05:56:00.000Z	muelli	djwattz	put the full filename there. i.e. /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ubuntu-tweak....
2010-11-25T06:30:00.000Z	muelli	djwattz	yes. You just plug the thing in.
2010-11-25T06:32:00.000Z	djwattz	muelli	i did that it doesnt do anything
2010-11-25T06:44:00.000Z	muelli	djwattz	plug it out, do a "sudo dmesg -c", plug it back in, do a "sudo dmesg -c" again and pastebin the output.
2010-11-25T06:49:00.000Z	djwattz	muelli	i did that it read it in the terminal where can i see it in the gui
2010-11-25T06:58:00.000Z	djwattz	muelli	u still here?
