2005-09-22T15:17:00.000Z	brenner		heh.....isnt that saying: ubguide is bad, but we're gonna use it as a base in breezy!
2005-09-22T15:18:00.000Z	brenner		it also doesn't recommend any other help avenues...ie the wiki
2005-09-22T15:20:00.000Z	brenner		iirc
2005-09-22T15:21:00.000Z	brenner		*exactly

2005-11-07T08:33:00.000Z	robotgeek	brenner	thanks, i din't know that!
2005-11-07T08:33:00.000Z	brenner	robotgeek	woo, i educated someone for once. :)
2005-11-07T08:34:00.000Z	robotgeek	brenner	much appreciated :)
2005-11-07T08:46:00.000Z	brenner	robotgeek	your turn to teach _me_ something :) trace?
2005-11-07T08:51:00.000Z	brenner	robotgeek	ah, gdb...how silly of me
2005-11-07T08:53:00.000Z	robotgeek	brenner	the newer quicktimes need w32codecs, AFAIK
2005-11-07T08:54:00.000Z	brenner	robotgeek	got them....qt movies play, i just don't get no sound
2005-11-07T08:55:00.000Z	robotgeek	brenner	it's been a while since i played anything quicktime on breezy
2005-11-07T08:58:00.000Z	brenner	robotgeek	he wants tetex3
2005-11-07T09:06:00.000Z	robotgeek	brenner	apparently, it's like service has to register it's presence or something funky like that!
2005-11-07T09:07:00.000Z	robotgeek	brenner	though, it would be nice to have gstreamer autoregister itself, or handled by debconf
2005-11-07T09:08:00.000Z	brenner	robotgeek	what if i am naughty and don't register?
2005-11-07T09:09:00.000Z	robotgeek	brenner	i dunno, i never did. i apparently don't use gstreamer!
