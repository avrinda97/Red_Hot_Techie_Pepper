2007-03-05T08:50:00.000Z	kelsin	AdvoWork	You have a couple of options. You can share files and mount them on each machine with NFS (Unix way) or Samba (Windows way) or you can SSH in to the box and copy files that way with sftp. You can ever set up syncing with rsync or other backup type of software. What type of use did you have in mind?
2007-03-05T09:05:00.000Z	AdvoWork	kelsin	the thing is, i dont even know what the server is called, it was setup for us, and not explained :s is there a way I can find that bit out first?
2007-03-05T09:05:00.000Z	kelsin	AdvoWork	you can find the hostname by typing "hostname" at the terminal
2007-03-05T09:06:00.000Z	AdvoWork	kelsin	will that work if im on the client though, asin will typing that in terminal on the client, give me the server details?
2007-03-05T09:06:00.000Z	kelsin	AdvoWork	wait, you'r on the client, without access to the server and have NO idea about the server's hostname or ip address?
2007-03-05T09:08:00.000Z	kelsin	AdvoWork	well, if you don't have pyshical access to the box, and don't know it's IP address you can't really do anything
2007-03-05T09:08:00.000Z	AdvoWork	kelsin	the main of it is im trying to get to the postgresql setup on the Server, from my client
2007-03-05T09:08:00.000Z	AdvoWork	kelsin	well the box is here... the client is plugged into it, then server - rotuer, but i dont know any details about the server really, its got no keyboard/mouse/screen :s
2007-03-05T09:09:00.000Z	kelsin	AdvoWork	the server is your router?
2007-03-05T09:09:00.000Z	AdvoWork	kelsin	no, i mean client -> server  then server -> router  its a test setup if you get me
2007-03-05T09:10:00.000Z	kelsin	AdvoWork	can you log into your router to then get the ip address that it's giving the server?
2007-03-05T09:11:00.000Z	AdvoWork	kelsin	actually.. i think I can tell what it is, but is there a way I can just check it?
2007-03-05T09:11:00.000Z	kelsin	AdvoWork	to connect with ssh: "ssh <username>@<ip.address.of.server>" obviously without the <>'s
2007-03-05T09:13:00.000Z	AdvoWork	kelsin	that worked.. im now at the server pc
2007-03-05T09:13:00.000Z	kelsin	AdvoWork	then there you go, you can type hostname to get it's hostname, and then continue to do whatever you want with it
2007-03-05T09:13:00.000Z	AdvoWork	kelsin	cheers :)   is it possible for me to find out where php is installed, and then where postgresql is installed to?
2007-03-05T09:45:00.000Z	kelsin	AdvoWork	it's probably running on the default postgres port 5432
2007-03-05T09:46:00.000Z	AdvoWork	kelsin	yea, it is :)
