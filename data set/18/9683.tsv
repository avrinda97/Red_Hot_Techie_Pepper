2007-03-14T12:31:00.000Z	odix		i just freed up like 40 gigs..since i can't resize my main ext3, what kind of drive should i create to associate with my main ext3
2007-03-14T12:31:00.000Z	odix		ext 2 or swap ?
2007-03-14T12:31:00.000Z	odix		mainly for media storage
2007-03-14T12:31:00.000Z	afflux	odix	swap can't be used as storage
2007-03-14T12:32:00.000Z	afflux	odix	yes
2007-03-14T12:34:00.000Z	odix	afflux	when i reboot will ubuntu auto mount these ?
2007-03-14T12:34:00.000Z	afflux	odix	If you put them into the /etc/fstab or tell the installer to do this
2007-03-14T12:39:00.000Z	odix	afflux	i dont see an option in gparted for it
2007-03-14T12:39:00.000Z	odix	afflux	but i did complete all operations successfulky
2007-03-14T12:40:00.000Z	afflux	odix	in the installer, after the gparted steps, it asks for the mount points
2007-03-14T12:41:00.000Z	odix	afflux	would if i missed then and already exited ?
2007-03-14T12:41:00.000Z	afflux	odix	no problem
2007-03-14T12:42:00.000Z	afflux	odix	just add a line to /etc/fstab
2007-03-14T12:42:00.000Z	afflux	odix	like: "/dev/hdX /media/mountpoint ext2 defaults 0 0"
2007-03-14T12:42:00.000Z	afflux	odix	change /Dev/hdX and /media/mountpoint according to your drive and where you wanna mount it
2007-03-14T12:47:00.000Z	afflux	odix	just ask :)
2007-03-14T12:48:00.000Z	afflux	odix	open a terminal, type: "xinit -- :1 -ac" ---- you'll get a clean new X server in VT 8 (you can switch back to VT7 by ctrl+alt+f7)
2007-03-14T12:49:00.000Z	afflux	odix	switch between these X servers by ctrl+alt+FX where X is the number of the VT. Default X server is VT7
