2005-07-22T05:52:00.000Z	HappyFool	fanskapet	i don't know dpkg-divert, but maybe you can try running dpkg -i on that .deb file, and try to see what the error is
2005-07-22T05:52:00.000Z	HappyFool	fanskapet	take a look at 'man dpkg' for debug flags -- there are lots under -d
2005-07-22T05:56:00.000Z	fanskapet	HappyFool	dpkg-divert: `diversion of /usr/lib32/libGL.so.1 to /usr/lib32/fglrx/libGL.so.1.xlibmesa by xorg-driver-fglrx' clashes with `diversion of /usr/lib32/libGL.so.1 to /usr/lib32/libGL.so.1.distrib by xorg-driver-fglrx'
2005-07-22T05:56:00.000Z	HappyFool	fanskapet	hmm. maybe remove the mesa drivers ?
2005-07-22T05:57:00.000Z	HappyFool	fanskapet	oh, no
2005-07-22T05:57:00.000Z	fanskapet	HappyFool	what? :)
2005-07-22T05:57:00.000Z	HappyFool	fanskapet	the package is conflicting with itself... ?
2005-07-22T05:57:00.000Z	fanskapet	HappyFool	hmm well i dunno really
2005-07-22T05:58:00.000Z	HappyFool	fanskapet	'.. by xorg-driver-fglrx conflicts with ... by xorg-driver-fglrx'
2005-07-22T05:58:00.000Z	HappyFool	fanskapet	do you have an xorg-driver-fglrx package already installed?
2005-07-22T05:59:00.000Z	HappyFool	fanskapet	try 'dpkg -l xorg-driver-fglrx|grep ^ii'
2005-07-22T05:59:00.000Z	fanskapet	HappyFool	didn't output anything at all in bash
2005-07-22T06:00:00.000Z	HappyFool	fanskapet	so, not installed. Sorry, i don't have a clue -- at a guess, that package is fubared. I can't see how it can conflict with itself
2005-07-22T06:01:00.000Z	HappyFool	fanskapet	i don't know -- haven't played with amd64/ati at all
2005-07-22T06:08:00.000Z	HappyFool	fanskapet	what was it?
2005-07-22T06:08:00.000Z	fanskapet	HappyFool	I removed the /usr/share/fglrx folder
2005-07-22T06:09:00.000Z	HappyFool	fanskapet	ok. bizarre
2005-07-22T06:09:00.000Z	HappyFool	fanskapet	ok. i would never ever have known that.
