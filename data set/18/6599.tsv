2008-04-29T07:59:00.000Z	comerc		it goes blank right after the orange bar loads
2008-04-29T07:59:00.000Z	comerc		yeah the install is fine i have tried both CDs
2008-04-29T08:00:00.000Z	comerc		dmesg?
2008-04-29T08:00:00.000Z	comerc		haha yeah
2008-04-29T08:00:00.000Z	comerc		the monitor shuts off as if the graphics card was having an issue
2008-04-29T08:01:00.000Z	comerc		what do you mean? i was booting into the live CD
2008-04-29T08:01:00.000Z	comerc		the only CD that works is the text based install, and that just works till the orange bar loads at the end of formatting and all that
2008-04-29T08:02:00.000Z	comerc		the live CD just goes blank as soon as the orange bar loads
2008-04-29T08:02:00.000Z	comerc		so in the text based install i just get a bit further basically
2008-04-29T08:02:00.000Z	comerc		X issue?
2008-04-29T08:02:00.000Z	dudus	comerc	i'd suggest to remmove the quiet and splash modifiers and see where exactly it hangs
2008-04-29T08:03:00.000Z	comerc	dudus	how can i do that?
2008-04-29T08:04:00.000Z	dudus	comerc	when you're on the screen that you choose how to boot the machine, the one with install, boot from hd and stuff..... try the first option and press F6 to set more options
2008-04-29T08:04:00.000Z	dudus	comerc	then it will give you a command line that it uses to boot the kernel.... just remove the quiet and splash words
2008-04-29T08:07:00.000Z	comerc	dudus	there was no word that said splash
2008-04-29T08:08:00.000Z	dudus	comerc	then press ctrl+alt+F1 to get the messages
2008-04-29T08:10:00.000Z	comerc	dudus	hit ctrl alt f1 during the orange bar loading part you mean?
2008-04-29T08:10:00.000Z	dudus	comerc	exactly
