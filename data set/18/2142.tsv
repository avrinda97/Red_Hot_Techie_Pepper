2011-05-28T17:53:00.000Z	rationalOgre		Could always sudo su if you really wanted to.
2011-05-28T17:53:00.000Z	rationalOgre		hehe
2011-05-28T17:53:00.000Z	theadmin	rationalOgre	meh, "sudo -i" is da way
2011-05-28T17:53:00.000Z	theadmin	rationalOgre	But you can always "sudo passwd root" as well
2011-05-28T18:23:00.000Z	rationalOgre	theadmin	Someone is an Arch user. :D
2011-05-28T18:24:00.000Z	theadmin	rationalOgre	Yup
2011-05-28T18:30:00.000Z	theadmin	rationalOgre	Arch is, well, rational :D
2011-05-28T18:32:00.000Z	rationalOgre	theadmin	I like Arch, one single installation taught me more about Linux then 20 ubuntu installs. No offense to Ubuntu, but it is "opaque" when trying to "get under the hood".
2011-05-28T18:32:00.000Z	theadmin	rationalOgre	I know right xD PM me and we can continue that
2011-05-28T18:32:00.000Z	theadmin	rationalOgre	Cause it's very offtopic
2011-06-12T10:26:00.000Z	theadmin	rationalOgre	Most systems don't have sudo, even desktop ones often don't :D
2011-06-12T12:11:00.000Z	theadmin	rationalOgre	We just did an a+x
2011-06-12T12:11:00.000Z	theadmin	rationalOgre	Not helping
2011-06-12T12:12:00.000Z	rationalOgre	theadmin	ah, sorry, didn't see that.
2011-06-12T12:59:00.000Z	theadmin	rationalOgre	Why the separate /root? That one almost always is empty
2011-06-12T12:59:00.000Z	rationalOgre	theadmin	I was using /root to refer to just /
2011-06-14T21:55:00.000Z	rationalOgre	theadmin	that's write-quit. I was just showing him how to write.
2011-06-14T21:56:00.000Z	theadmin	rationalOgre	Well yeah good point
