2006-10-17T06:53:00.000Z	catalytic		i just plugged my lcd screen in
2006-10-17T06:53:00.000Z	catalytic		and there is about a 1cm gap missing on the right
2006-10-17T06:53:00.000Z	catalytic		how can i fix this?
2006-10-17T06:53:00.000Z	dandaman32	catalytic	try changing your display resolution
2006-10-17T06:55:00.000Z	dandaman32	catalytic	manufacturer and model of the lcd?
2006-10-17T06:56:00.000Z	dandaman32	catalytic	is display is explicitly set to 1280x1024, and is the entire screen area showing?
2006-10-17T06:58:00.000Z	dandaman32	catalytic	you probably need to contact viewsonic then, they are a good company and if your lcd is still under warranty then they will probably replace it for you
2006-10-17T07:00:00.000Z	dandaman32	catalytic	do you have a copy of windows on that system?
2006-10-17T07:01:00.000Z	dandaman32	catalytic	have you explicitly installed ATI's closed-source drivers?
2006-10-17T07:02:00.000Z	dandaman32	catalytic	hmm, it's pretty hard to mess up installation of X drivers, did the monitor work right when you used the opensource driver?
2006-10-17T07:04:00.000Z	dandaman32	catalytic	type sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf, then find "Section "Device"" and change the Driver entry from fglrx to ati, then log out and back in
2006-10-17T07:07:00.000Z	dandaman32	catalytic	ok, interesting...i thought you said you made it to the testing part
2006-10-17T07:12:00.000Z	dandaman32	catalytic	sorry if i already asked this but did you try plugging the monitor into a different computer after it started acting strange?
2006-10-17T07:16:00.000Z	catalytic	dandaman32	works fine
2006-10-17T07:17:00.000Z	dandaman32	catalytic	you tried rebooting and such?
2006-10-17T07:18:00.000Z	dandaman32	catalytic	go ahead and try rebooting, thats really the only suggestion i got left
2006-10-17T07:20:00.000Z	dandaman32	catalytic	ive tried to use it, it doesnt work for me
2006-10-17T07:20:00.000Z	dandaman32	catalytic	i dunno, it should be letting you use a different tty
