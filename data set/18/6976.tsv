2008-02-23T14:19:00.000Z	sbox		Hello all
2008-02-23T14:19:00.000Z	sbox		does anyone use swiftfox?>
2008-02-23T14:20:00.000Z	fredmv	sbox	you mean swiftweasel?
2008-02-23T14:20:00.000Z	sbox	fredmv	no, swiftfox.. it's another version of firefo
2008-02-23T14:20:00.000Z	sbox		firefox
2008-02-23T14:21:00.000Z	fredmv	sbox	well, if it's anything like swiftweasel, I tried it, and wasn't too impressed. seemed a lot less stable than Firefox
2008-02-23T14:21:00.000Z	sbox	fredmv	swiftfox is very good, but they seem to have realised a new version and it's no so hot
2008-02-23T14:23:00.000Z	fredmv	sbox	have you checked out Firefox3b?  it's pretty sweet
2008-02-23T14:23:00.000Z	sbox	fredmv	no i haven't actually.. shall do.. i find FF a little thursty
2008-02-23T14:23:00.000Z	fredmv		yup
2008-02-23T14:23:00.000Z	fredmv		it's been out for like a week
2008-02-23T14:24:00.000Z	sbox	fredmv	you got any idea where I can get it, google isn;t showing up much
2008-02-23T14:24:00.000Z	fredmv		http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/all-beta.html
2008-02-23T14:25:00.000Z	sbox	fredmv	ok.. serious blonde moment.. thought it was a derivative of ff
2008-02-23T14:25:00.000Z	fredmv		lol, it's all good.
2008-02-23T14:26:00.000Z	sbox	fredmv	if u get a chance try swiftfox, its just for some reason their latest versions only work with one theme.. a kack theme at that
2008-02-23T14:27:00.000Z	fredmv	sbox	I've tried swiftweasel which is evidently a Debian/Ubuntu specific version.   simple things (e.g., setting wallpaper) and using the DOM inpspector crashed it... didn't like that one bit.
2008-02-23T14:29:00.000Z	fredmv	sbox	you wanna see some cool stuff, install stellarium
