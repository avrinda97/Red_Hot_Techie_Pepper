2005-12-16T14:00:00.000Z	Tedd		GAIM is giving me FITS with stuff I need.
2005-12-16T14:00:00.000Z	mrkoje	Tedd	whats wrong with Gaim?
2005-12-16T14:01:00.000Z	Tedd	mrkoje	Yes.
2005-12-16T14:01:00.000Z	mrkoje	Tedd	 the direct connect feature should work fine with Gaim
2005-12-16T14:02:00.000Z	mrkoje	Tedd	 My bad.. I haven't used Gaim with AIM proto.. just msn and yahoo.
2005-12-16T14:53:00.000Z	mrkoje	Tedd	 You could try to install AIM in WINE....
2005-12-16T14:53:00.000Z	Tedd	mrkoje	read up. Already tried.
2005-12-16T14:54:00.000Z	mrkoje	Tedd	Well I am betting it can be done through Wine.. you just need to know how to use wine
2005-12-16T14:55:00.000Z	mrkoje	Tedd	 Goto  http://www.AIM.com  front page shows AIM for Linux Version 1.5
2005-12-16T14:55:00.000Z	Tedd	mrkoje	It freezes when I download it.
2005-12-16T14:56:00.000Z	mrkoje	Tedd	 What more can you ask for? A native port of AIM from AOL!
2005-12-16T14:56:00.000Z	mrkoje	Tedd	 If it freezes.... download it from a different computer.... try that
2005-12-16T14:57:00.000Z	mrkoje	Tedd	 The AIM from AOL even has a deb package what more could you ask for holy cow
2005-12-16T14:58:00.000Z	Tedd	mrkoje	I'm about to try from a different browser.
2005-12-16T14:58:00.000Z	mrkoje	Tedd	 Honestly.. I have been reading your request for help for 3 hours now! That is the best you could ever ask for... it a goddamned deb!
2005-12-16T14:59:00.000Z	Tedd	mrkoje	Had you read the part where I said "I'm trying to"? Get off my back for chrissakes.
2005-12-16T14:59:00.000Z	mrkoje	Tedd	 sorry.. I didn't mean to come across like that :) lol
