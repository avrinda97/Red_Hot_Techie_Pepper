2011-04-22T16:19:00.000Z	h-dee		Hi...I need some help here. I'm trying to connect my 10.10 to my XP powered Desktop. I can see the Windows Network under Places->Network->Windows Network. Whenever I try to connect it, it just returns me with the login screen again and again. Need guidance please. Thanks!
2011-04-22T16:21:00.000Z	aLky	h-dee	enable the guest account on xp and remove the password
2011-04-22T16:21:00.000Z	h-dee	aLky	Thanks! Let me try that now.
2011-04-22T16:22:00.000Z	h-dee		aLKy: By removing password, you mean Admin's password?
2011-04-22T16:22:00.000Z	aLky		no, guest's password
2011-04-22T16:22:00.000Z	h-dee		ok
2011-04-22T16:23:00.000Z	h-dee		aLKy: No success!
2011-04-22T16:23:00.000Z	aLky		did you try using your username and password that you use to login your pc?
2011-04-22T16:24:00.000Z	h-dee		aLKy: Yes, I'm trying my authentication details I use to login to my XP
2011-04-22T16:24:00.000Z	h-dee		aLKy: Network ID also set to "MSHOME" as I read somewhere in forums.
2011-04-22T16:26:00.000Z	aLky	h-dee	have you tried to see if you can access the desktop from another windows machine?
2011-04-22T16:26:00.000Z	h-dee		aLKy: I don't have any other machine. But, I can ping my XP from here.
2011-04-22T16:28:00.000Z	aLky	h-dee	is it xp home or pro?
2011-04-22T16:28:00.000Z	h-dee		Pro
2011-04-22T16:28:00.000Z	h-dee		SP3
2011-04-22T16:29:00.000Z	aLky		and you are trying to access shared folder?
2011-04-22T16:29:00.000Z	h-dee		Yes!
2011-04-22T16:32:00.000Z	aLky	h-dee	i dont know then - could be many things - is file sharing enabled? is "server" service enabled? is there any firewalls? is your user member of a group which has permission to access from the network? there was more things but i cant remember - its been years since i've done that
