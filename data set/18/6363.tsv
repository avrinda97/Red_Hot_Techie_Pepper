2008-05-18T23:49:00.000Z	ikonia	emusamurai	eth0 is not configured
2008-05-18T23:49:00.000Z	emusamurai	ikonia	how do I configured eth0?
2008-05-18T23:49:00.000Z	ikonia	emusamurai	system --> administration --> network tools
2008-05-18T23:50:00.000Z	emusamurai	ikonia	it's not plugged in right now. Is it normal for eth0 to not have a usable configure button?
2008-05-18T23:51:00.000Z	ikonia	emusamurai	no, it should be there even if it's not plugged in
2008-05-18T23:51:00.000Z	emusamurai	ikonia	I'm here at devices, with eth0 selected, and nothing's happening.
2008-05-18T23:52:00.000Z	ikonia	emusamurai	my mistake, for networking-tools - it does need to be plugged in
2008-05-18T23:52:00.000Z	emusamurai	ikonia	what should I do once I plug it in? We won't be able to talk once I do.
2008-05-18T23:53:00.000Z	ikonia	emusamurai	plug it in, click configure
2008-05-18T23:53:00.000Z	emusamurai	ikonia	and?
2008-05-18T23:53:00.000Z	ikonia	emusamurai	configure it
2008-05-18T23:53:00.000Z	emusamurai	ikonia	what should I configure it to do?
2008-05-18T23:53:00.000Z	ikonia	emusamurai	set it to dhcp, give it a static ip
2008-05-18T23:53:00.000Z	emusamurai	ikonia	ok.
2008-05-18T23:53:00.000Z	ikonia	emusamurai	what ever you want
