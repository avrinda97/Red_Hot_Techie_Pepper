2008-05-29T19:04:00.000Z	sparkyy		is there a way to delete the trash from the command line?
2008-05-29T19:05:00.000Z	Pici	sparkyy	In Hardy?
2008-05-29T19:06:00.000Z	Pici	sparkyy	Trash is in  ~/.local/share/Trash now
2008-05-29T19:08:00.000Z	sparkyy	Pici	I can't delete it.  I get:  cannot remove - it is a directory
2008-05-29T19:08:00.000Z	Pici	sparkyy	You need to look in there to see what files  to delete.
2008-05-29T19:09:00.000Z	sparkyy	Pici	 thats a bug right?  I cant delete it in Gnome
2008-05-29T19:09:00.000Z	Pici	sparkyy	Delete which?
2008-05-29T19:10:00.000Z	Pici	sparkyy	The actuall Trash directory, or something inside it?
2008-05-29T19:10:00.000Z	sparkyy	Pici	I deleted it normally in Gnome and the Trash will NOT empty
2008-05-29T19:13:00.000Z	sparkyy	Pici	Its all set now.  But the permissions where 700 on the files/directory for some reason... (in the Trash dir)
2008-05-29T19:13:00.000Z	Pici	sparkyy	Odd.
2008-05-29T19:14:00.000Z	sparkyy	Pici	 looks to be a bug.  I downloaded gparted and then deleted the iso.  And the trash would NOT empty.  Perhaps ubuntu really liked it. =P
2008-05-29T19:40:00.000Z	sparkyy	Pici	Thanks man!
2008-05-29T19:40:00.000Z	sparkyy	Pici	Have a great day!
2008-05-29T19:40:00.000Z	Pici	sparkyy	Sure, you too
