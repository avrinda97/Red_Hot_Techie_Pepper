2006-01-06T08:36:00.000Z	BullFire		can anybody give some tips?
2006-01-06T08:38:00.000Z	BullFire		but I have a server installation
2006-01-06T08:38:00.000Z	dabaR	BullFire	ya, but what driver do you need enabled. Do you know of a way to enable it yourself in a terminal?
2006-01-06T08:39:00.000Z	dabaR	BullFire	wasn't the command to add the module permanently something like "sudo modprobe -a ipg"?
2006-01-06T08:40:00.000Z	dabaR	BullFire	don't just run that, I am not sure, but read the man page.
2006-01-06T08:40:00.000Z	BullFire	dabaR	why not?
2006-01-06T08:41:00.000Z	BullFire	dabaR	whats the man page?
2006-01-06T08:41:00.000Z	dabaR	BullFire	sec.
2006-01-06T08:52:00.000Z	dabaR	BullFire	"echo ipg|sudo tee -a /etc/modules"
2006-01-06T08:52:00.000Z	dabaR	BullFire	that will add the module to startup.
2006-01-06T08:55:00.000Z	BullFire	dabaR	I will try that:)
2006-01-06T09:03:00.000Z	dabaR	BullFire	"q"
2006-01-06T09:03:00.000Z	dabaR	BullFire	I am sure someone knows.
2006-01-06T09:04:00.000Z	BullFire	dabaR	thank you:)
