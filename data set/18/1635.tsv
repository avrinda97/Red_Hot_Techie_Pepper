2011-07-02T19:21:00.000Z	Soothsayer		How easy it is to switch desktop environments?
2011-07-02T19:22:00.000Z	Soothsayer		I'm not liking the entire Unity usability .. and especially it has nothing for a dual monitor setup. I'd like to try out something else. Any recommendations?
2011-07-02T19:22:00.000Z	skilz	Soothsayer	Easy as 1,2,3.
2011-07-02T19:23:00.000Z	Soothsayer		great... any recommendations for something that's better suited for dual monitor ?
2011-07-02T19:23:00.000Z	Soothsayer		I mean, even Windows 7 has better taskbar capabilities and with 'Ultramon', I get a perfect taskbar on my second conitor
2011-07-02T19:23:00.000Z	Soothsayer		monitor*
2011-07-02T19:23:00.000Z	skilz	Soothsayer	Gnome
2011-07-02T19:24:00.000Z	Soothsayer	skilz	classic gnome? it already comes with Ubuntu 11 as well right ?
2011-07-02T19:24:00.000Z	skilz		yes
2011-07-02T19:24:00.000Z	Soothsayer	skilz	Anything with taskbar support like Windows 7? I hate it when you click on some program in the taskbar which has multiple windows open, ALL OF THEM open.
2011-07-02T19:25:00.000Z	skilz		Seems to work fine for me
2011-07-02T19:26:00.000Z	Soothsayer	skilz	do u have a dual monitor setup as well?
2011-07-02T19:26:00.000Z	skilz		yes
2011-07-02T19:26:00.000Z	skilz	Soothsayer	Well I used to
2011-07-02T19:26:00.000Z	skilz	Soothsayer	I had a 24" and a 19"
2011-07-02T19:26:00.000Z	Soothsayer	skilz	did you have a taskbar on the second window?
2011-07-02T19:27:00.000Z	skilz		yes
2011-07-02T19:27:00.000Z	Soothsayer	skilz	anything you had to configure for it?
