2009-02-14T03:07:00.000Z	Myrtti	Magellan	this channel is for strictly support issues, so we ask you to keep the other stuff to other channels, like #ubuntu-offtopic
2009-02-14T03:08:00.000Z	Myrtti	Magellan	also, we ask the users of this channel to mind common netiquette as this channel is very popular among different people from different cultures
2009-02-14T03:08:00.000Z	Magellan	Myrtti	Do you have an ubuntu-upstream ?
2009-02-14T03:08:00.000Z	Myrtti	Magellan	Jaunty will be published in April.
2009-02-14T03:08:00.000Z	Magellan	Myrtti	Better, please speed it up. I require it in march
2009-02-14T03:09:00.000Z	Myrtti	Magellan	too bad
2009-02-14T03:09:00.000Z	Magellan	Myrtti	However, you do not know me :=)
2009-02-14T03:09:00.000Z	Myrtti	Magellan	and you don't know me. Was there anything else Ubuntu support related you wanted to ask/discuss?
2009-02-14T03:10:00.000Z	Magellan	Myrtti	There are tops 3-5 better skilled people on GNU/Linux in this channel. I hope yournt asking me to leave, are you ?
2009-02-14T03:11:00.000Z	Myrtti	Magellan	I'm asking you to stick to the topic, either help others or state your problem with ubuntu - offtopic is to be kept on other channels
2009-02-14T03:14:00.000Z	Magellan	Myrtti	A coworker has a fujitsu amilo computer. On the windows side vista / nvidia has great trouble in that the nvidia driver wont run at all so he gets no screensaver or 3D at all. Ubuntu 8.04 and 8.10 bahaves the same way however, i have followed traxx and see that Jaunty will probaly use Shared Irq's (Like old and crummy computers used back in the daze)
2009-02-14T03:15:00.000Z	Magellan	Myrtti	That would solve that issue. I see theres a war going on between the hardware makers today
