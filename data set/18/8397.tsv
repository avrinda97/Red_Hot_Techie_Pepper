2007-10-26T12:03:00.000Z	clever	Some_ux	yeah i get 200 failed passwords a day on my open ssh server(wide open on port 22)
2007-10-26T12:16:00.000Z	clever	Some_ux	yep
2007-10-26T12:10:00.000Z	clever	Some_ux	i use winscp to connect to the sftp/scp server(in sshd)
2007-10-26T12:11:00.000Z	Some_ux	clever	I have putty, so i guess i also have psftp. How do i set that up ?
2007-10-26T12:11:00.000Z	clever	Some_ux	i dont use putty's scp client
2007-10-26T12:11:00.000Z	clever	Some_ux	i think its a cli based copy of scp which makes it more complex to use
2007-10-26T12:12:00.000Z	clever	Some_ux	winscp gives you a listing of files on both sides and a full ui
2007-10-26T12:12:00.000Z	Some_ux	clever	I dont really need something too fancy
2007-10-26T12:12:00.000Z	clever	Some_ux	scp doesnt even give a file listing
2007-10-26T12:12:00.000Z	clever	Some_ux	with scp you have to know the full path of the source & dest file
2007-10-26T12:14:00.000Z	Some_ux	clever	How does the client know the private key ?
2007-10-26T12:14:00.000Z	clever	Some_ux	normaly the public/private keys arent set at all
2007-10-26T12:14:00.000Z	clever	Some_ux	so you have to use a password
2007-10-26T12:15:00.000Z	Some_ux	clever	password is not too safe
2007-10-26T12:15:00.000Z	clever	Some_ux	ssh protects the password
2007-10-26T12:15:00.000Z	clever	Some_ux	but saving the pw within winscp is less safe
2007-10-26T12:16:00.000Z	Some_ux	clever	still, if you have a private key, and passphrase, that should be as safe as it can get
2007-10-26T12:16:00.000Z	clever	Some_ux	get puttygen.exe from the putty site if you want to make a key pair
