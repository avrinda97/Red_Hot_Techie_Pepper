2009-03-27T06:39:00.000Z	caine607		Ye gods there's a lotta people on here.  OK, problem, I want to boot a pc desktop off of ubuntu livecd.  Got a cd from a friend, it boots up this slick GUI, I choose "try ubuntu temporarily" and after a bit I get a popup dialogue with one OK button, title is "Boot Loader" and in the dialogue it says "/casper/vmlinuz"
2009-03-27T06:39:00.000Z	caine607		I thought it might be the CD, so I went and downloaded ubuntu-8.10-desktop-i386.iso, burned it to CD, same problem
2009-03-27T06:40:00.000Z	caine607		(Note, I downloaded that via ubuntu.com, off the Gigenet mirror)
2009-03-27T06:40:00.000Z	caine607		So.... what am I doing wrong?
2009-03-27T06:41:00.000Z	caine607		This is on a fairly recent dell quad core, by the way
2009-03-27T06:42:00.000Z	DasEi	caine607	check the download, check the cd :
2009-03-27T06:42:00.000Z	caine607	DasEi	How do I check the down
2009-03-27T06:44:00.000Z	caine607	DasEi	thanks.
2009-03-27T06:44:00.000Z	DasEi	caine607	on the d/l page there you can find the hash of the file, then md5sum blahblah.iso , compare the result with the hash;  next use cd's option verify medium
2009-03-27T06:44:00.000Z	caine607	DasEi	thanks, in progress
2009-03-27T06:47:00.000Z	caine607	DasEi	any ideas on how to verify CD on windows?  I used InfraRecorder as suggested by ubuntu.com but I can't find a verify o ption.
2009-03-27T06:48:00.000Z	DasEi	caine607	there is a tool, google md5sum, then select from properties (#windows)
2009-03-27T06:48:00.000Z	caine607	DasEi	I verified the md5sum
2009-03-27T06:48:00.000Z	caine607	DasEi	it checks out as ok.
2009-03-27T06:48:00.000Z	caine607	DasEi	On the iso I downloade
2009-03-27T06:50:00.000Z	caine607	DasEi	 Check CD gets the same "boot loader" dialogue
2009-03-27T06:52:00.000Z	caine607	DasEi	Whats a good speed? 4x?
2009-03-27T06:52:00.000Z	caine607	DasEi	thanks!
