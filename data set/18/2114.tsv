2011-06-21T03:51:00.000Z	rypervenche	Alexander	I have a good PDF for you, one moment.
2011-06-21T03:51:00.000Z	rypervenche	Alexander	Click on "Download it here." http://linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php
2011-06-21T03:52:00.000Z	rypervenche	Alexander	That PDF will teach you how to use the command line.
2011-06-21T03:57:00.000Z	rypervenche	Alexander	You should read that PDF I sent you before continuing. Like SummerB said, you need to learn the command line first or you will be lost and make many mistakes.
2011-06-21T03:58:00.000Z	rypervenche	Alexander	You don't need to read the entire thing either, but start learning how to use it.
2011-06-21T03:59:00.000Z	Alexander	rypervenche	what if i want to use it with a program in wine?
2011-06-21T03:59:00.000Z	rypervenche	Alexander	If you want to use what with a program in wine?
2011-06-21T04:01:00.000Z	rypervenche	Alexander	You will probably be able to answer those questions yourself once you know the command line better.
