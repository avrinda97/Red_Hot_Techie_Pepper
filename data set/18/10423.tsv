2006-12-04T12:58:00.000Z	rance		I have a server with two nics, one for external, one for internal, external interface is configured to obtain its address with dhcp.
2006-12-04T12:58:00.000Z	rance		The dhcp server provides a domain-name-server ip for use in /etc/resolv.conf
2006-12-04T12:59:00.000Z	rance		my question is how do I tell ubuntu to use a different ip than the one provided for the /etc/resolv.conf file
2006-12-04T12:59:00.000Z	sain	rance	/etc/resolv is for your DNS servers
2006-12-04T13:00:00.000Z	rance	sain	I know it is
2006-12-04T13:00:00.000Z	sain	rance	then just edit that file
2006-12-04T13:00:00.000Z	sain	rance	what's the problem?
2006-12-04T13:01:00.000Z	sain	rance	well?
2006-12-04T13:02:00.000Z	rance	sain	my problem is that when my external interface gets its IP from the dhcp server it gets a domain-name-server in the dhcp packet, and it rewrites /etc/resolv.conf in response, I want to intercept that /etc/resolv.conf rewrite and fix the ip address
2006-12-04T13:03:00.000Z	sain	rance	you can usually adjust whether the nameserver is changed from the program you connect with
2006-12-04T13:04:00.000Z	sain	rance	like for dial-up there is something you can change in the ppp config
2006-12-04T13:05:00.000Z	sain	rance	what kind of connection do you have? adsl, cable?
2006-12-04T13:09:00.000Z	rance	sain	its an adsl
2006-12-04T13:11:00.000Z	sain	rance	why don't you like the nameserver your ISP is giving you?
2006-12-04T13:11:00.000Z	sain	rance	i hope you aren't downloading some kind of wierd porn
2006-12-04T13:12:00.000Z	rance	sain	no, im setting up a home router with its own dns server in case there ever would be an internet outage my internal stuff would still work
2006-12-04T13:13:00.000Z	sain	rance	like i say, it's a setting somewhere whether to accept the ISPs nameserver ... i'm not on ubuntu atm so i can't tell you
2006-12-04T13:13:00.000Z	sain	rance	the setting will be in the program that makes the connection to your isp
