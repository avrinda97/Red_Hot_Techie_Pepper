2005-09-16T12:35:00.000Z	vladuz976_		how do you remove *.deb files?
2005-09-16T12:37:00.000Z	nickrud	vladuz976_	dpkg --remove <package> is basic; using synapic is preferred
2005-09-16T12:37:00.000Z	vladuz976_	nickrud	yeah will synaptic find stuff that wasn't isntalled with apt?
2005-09-16T12:37:00.000Z	nickrud	vladuz976_	it should be under Local or Obsolete Packages
2005-09-16T12:38:00.000Z	vladuz976_	nickrud	how do you search those obsolete in synaptic?
2005-09-16T12:40:00.000Z	nickrud	vladuz976_	select the tab status, and it's actually Installed (local or obsolete)
2005-09-16T12:42:00.000Z	vladuz976_	nickrud	i don't understand, what tab status? i don't see that
2005-09-16T12:42:00.000Z	nickrud	vladuz976_	on the lower left corner of synaptic, there are four buttons (smile) select status
2005-09-16T12:43:00.000Z	vladuz976_	nickrud	i found it but i can't find the package i installed
2005-09-16T12:44:00.000Z	nickrud	vladuz976_	now, select the Installed (local or obsolete) in the left pane (it mentions all, Installed, etc.) that's where I find my local packages
2005-09-16T12:45:00.000Z	nickrud	vladuz976_	for example, the java package I used dpkg -i on
2005-09-16T12:47:00.000Z	vladuz976_	nickrud	i used that for installing evidence
2005-09-16T12:47:00.000Z	vladuz976_	nickrud	but now i can't find it
2005-09-16T12:47:00.000Z	nickrud	vladuz976_	try dpkg -l evidence ; if it's installed you should get some feedback
2005-09-16T12:48:00.000Z	vladuz976_	nickrud	didn't get anything
2005-09-16T12:49:00.000Z	nickrud	vladuz976_	then, you either have the package name wrong, or it's not installed
2005-09-16T12:52:00.000Z	vladuz976_	nickrud	i got it from here http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/evidence/evidence_0.9.8-20050305-hoaryGMW_i386.deb
2005-09-16T12:53:00.000Z	nickrud	vladuz976_	then try dpkg -l evi*
