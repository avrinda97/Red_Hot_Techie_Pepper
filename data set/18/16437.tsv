2010-12-30T03:59:00.000Z	Kelocena		All I know is I've had trouble with using the "upgrade" button in Update Manager before, but reformating and freshly installing fixed the issue.
2010-12-30T03:59:00.000Z	Kelocena		I've heard other people say that too. But I'm no expert. Sadly.
2010-12-30T04:00:00.000Z	Kelocena		ohei. Join the broken sound club :D
2010-12-30T04:01:00.000Z	Kelocena		What's wrong with your sound?
2010-12-30T04:02:00.000Z	Kelocena		I'm pretty sure my issue is a bug. And I posted on the forums and no one has replied. Huzzah. Should I report it? >_>
2010-12-30T04:02:00.000Z	Kelocena		hurr hurr
2010-12-30T04:03:00.000Z	maco	Kelocena	yes. ubuntu-bug -s audio
2010-12-30T04:06:00.000Z	maco	Kelocena	thats the command to report an audio bug and automatically include a whole bunch of audio debugging info to make it easier for developers to fix your bug
2010-12-30T04:09:00.000Z	maco	Kelocena	thankfully there is a team of people working to ask the right questions on the bug reports :) that command's auto-magic stuff keeps them from having to ask for the same set of log files and hardware info from everyone though so you get fewer questions in your email to answer about the bug
2010-12-30T04:10:00.000Z	maco	Kelocena	yep
2010-12-30T04:17:00.000Z	maco	Kelocena	it was muted?
2010-12-30T04:18:00.000Z	maco	Kelocena	are you not using pulse?
2010-12-30T04:24:00.000Z	maco	Kelocena	yeah...cuz if you're using pulse, everything goes through it. your user doesnt need to be in the audio group (and by default isnt)
2010-12-30T04:24:00.000Z	maco	Kelocena	so its probably a driver bug
2010-12-30T04:30:00.000Z	maco	Kelocena	lspci -vv | grep -A1 0403
2010-12-30T04:31:00.000Z	maco	Kelocena	what's the SSID?
2010-12-30T04:31:00.000Z	maco	Kelocena	adding things to alsa-base.conf usually takes a reboot to go into effect, btw
2010-12-30T04:32:00.000Z	maco	Kelocena	didnt print anything?
