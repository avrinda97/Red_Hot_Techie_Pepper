2012-03-16T08:02:00.000Z	webnet	KatsumeBlisk	it kind of makes sense tho. lol. Unity starts with a U shouldnt it be called gubuntu if it had gnome the whole time? like kubuntu or fluxbuntu xubuntu. etc lol
2012-03-16T08:03:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	webnet	No. Ubuntu has always had GNOME until Unity, which is still GNOME-based.
2012-03-16T08:04:00.000Z	webnet	KatsumeBlisk	 i know. it was a joke about the first letter

2012-03-16T09:07:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	webnet	While it's necessary, I'm not a fan of SQL. XD It's got weird syntax because it tries to be too user-friendly.
2012-03-16T09:08:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	webnet	I did just start learning SQL this year though.
2012-03-16T09:08:00.000Z	webnet	KatsumeBlisk	yeah. and oracle now owns it.... im not an oracle fan though i love java
2012-03-16T09:08:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	webnet	Same. Well, I don't *love* Java, but it's decent.
2012-03-16T09:08:00.000Z	webnet	KatsumeBlisk	is it C or c++ you can use with... aww what the h3ll is that nokia IDE
2012-03-16T09:08:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	webnet	Pardon?
2012-03-16T09:09:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	webnet	Qt?
2012-03-16T09:09:00.000Z	webnet	KatsumeBlisk	THATS IT!
2012-03-16T09:10:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	webnet	C++. I'm not sure about C with it though. Qt is a great library. Never used it myself on the developer side of things
2012-03-16T09:10:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	webnet	Qt is very cross platform.
2012-03-16T09:11:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	webnet	Me too. :D
