2012-10-22T18:07:00.000Z	engehap		i've bridged 2 interfaces
2012-10-22T18:07:00.000Z	engehap		but when try to use this bridge to connect 2 networks
2012-10-22T18:08:00.000Z	engehap		the arp request and replys donn't get throw the bridge
2012-10-22T18:08:00.000Z	compdoc	engehap	maybe pastebin your conf files
2012-10-22T18:08:00.000Z	engehap	compdoc	what do you mean
2012-10-22T18:09:00.000Z	compdoc	engehap	pastebin.org to show us your setup
2012-10-22T18:10:00.000Z	engehap		http://pastebin.com/Cs3B5MU1 this is the interfaces file
2012-10-22T18:11:00.000Z	compdoc	engehap	are you sure you can set up a bridge that way
2012-10-22T18:12:00.000Z	engehap	compdoc	also used these commands http://pastebin.com/VSxLztf1
2012-10-22T18:12:00.000Z	compdoc	engehap	ok, I see that you can
2012-10-22T18:12:00.000Z	engehap	compdoc	i have the same conf running on another machine
2012-10-22T18:14:00.000Z	engehap	compdoc	on the bridge i recive traffic and arp requests from both interfaces but no replys
2012-10-22T18:14:00.000Z	compdoc	engehap	I think you have one thing wrong
2012-10-22T18:15:00.000Z	engehap	compdoc	which is??
2012-10-22T18:16:00.000Z	compdoc	engehap	I use bridges for qemu-kvm, but not as you have done, but I think you need this at least:   http://pastebin.com/t6BsHe8f
