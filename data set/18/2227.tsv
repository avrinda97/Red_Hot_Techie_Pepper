2011-05-14T23:11:00.000Z	Piranah		ok people, Ubuntu + Unitity minimize xchat and it does not go to the so called taskbar. Any fix or easy work arround ?
2011-05-14T23:12:00.000Z	tensorpudding	Piranah	someone came in here with that problem yesterday
2011-05-14T23:12:00.000Z	tensorpudding	Piranah	can you alt+tab to it?
2011-05-14T23:12:00.000Z	Piranah	tensorpudding	nope
2011-05-14T23:12:00.000Z	Piranah		its like it becomes a hidden task
2011-05-14T23:12:00.000Z	tensorpudding	Piranah	do you have it to minimize to the tray?
2011-05-14T23:13:00.000Z	Piranah		yup
2011-05-14T23:13:00.000Z	tensorpudding	Piranah	that's the thing, the application indicator area in natty is not the tray
2011-05-14T23:13:00.000Z	tensorpudding	Piranah	the tray is in fact hidden by default
2011-05-14T23:13:00.000Z	Piranah	tensorpudding	ok so kill that option in xchat and all should be good ?
2011-05-14T23:13:00.000Z	tensorpudding	Piranah	i think so
2011-05-14T23:15:00.000Z	Piranah	tensorpudding	ok lol now i need to figure out howto disable min to tray lol
2011-05-14T23:15:00.000Z	tensorpudding	Piranah	if you want, you can unhide the tray for a minute, then rehide it
2011-05-14T23:15:00.000Z	Piranah	tensorpudding	how ?
2011-05-14T23:16:00.000Z	tensorpudding	Piranah	you need to open the terminal and put in the following line
2011-05-14T23:17:00.000Z	tensorpudding	Piranah	gsettings set com.canonical.Unity.Panel systray-whitelist "['all']"
2011-05-14T23:18:00.000Z	Piranah		<tensorpudding> thnx i well try that Best regards!
2011-05-14T23:19:00.000Z	tensorpudding	Piranah	to reset it back to normal, you do gsettings reset com.canonical.Unity.Panel systray-whitelist
