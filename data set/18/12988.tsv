2006-02-18T12:44:00.000Z	M_A_K		Is there a significant difference between kubuntu and ubuntu with kde installed along with gnome?
2006-02-18T12:45:00.000Z	M_A_K		So if I am new to linux and wish to try *ubuntu, would you suggest ubuntu and install kde as well or kubuntu?
2006-02-18T12:46:00.000Z	_jason	M_A_K	you just install the kubuntu-desktop package and you get both gnome and kde
2006-02-18T12:47:00.000Z	M_A_K	_jason	: so I should download the kubuntu ios and go from there?
2006-02-18T12:47:00.000Z	_jason	M_A_K	if you download the kubuntu iso, you will only get kde.  If you want to get gnome after that you just install 'ubuntu-desktop' package.  Then you will have both
2006-02-18T12:48:00.000Z	_jason	M_A_K	yeah
2006-03-07T10:13:00.000Z	_jason	M_A_K	I think easiest way would be to make a new group and add the group to /etc/sudoers.  There is proper syntax that will allow access only to certain commands (you would just use whatever opens network tools).  I don't know the syntax too well though
2006-03-07T10:14:00.000Z	M_A_K	_jason	: do you know where I can read more about this?
2006-03-07T10:14:00.000Z	_jason	M_A_K	man sudoers
2006-03-07T10:15:00.000Z	_jason	M_A_K	probably some easier to read tutorials on google, but I don';t know of any
2006-03-07T10:16:00.000Z	M_A_K	_jason	: how do I find out what program I need to give access to for network settings?
2006-03-07T10:16:00.000Z	_jason	M_A_K	by the way, when you edit /etc/sudoers, you want to use the 'visudo' command.  It will make sure you don't mess up the syntax and lock yourself out
2006-03-07T10:17:00.000Z	_jason	M_A_K	oh come on, vi is awesome.  But no you don't have to use it.  Just do 'EDITOR=nano sudo visudo', I think that will give you nano
2006-03-07T10:20:00.000Z	_jason	M_A_K	not necessary, just more efficient.  You can just use 'ed' too instead of nano if you want to get more basic
2006-03-07T10:21:00.000Z	_jason	M_A_K	network-admin is the command
2006-03-07T10:22:00.000Z	M_A_K	_jason	: so I can give them access to sudo that command and they schould have access to change the network settings?
2006-03-07T10:23:00.000Z	_jason	M_A_K	yeah, you just have to look up the syntax.  Make a new group, maybe 'students'.  Then I know you start the line with %students, and workk from there
2006-03-07T10:40:00.000Z	_jason	M_A_K	it's vimtutor
