2011-06-19T07:46:00.000Z	mekius		Trying to install 11.4 on a machine with a sata hd and ide cdrom.  I've messed with the bios for 3 hours and it just will not mount the cdrom when I try to boot the live environment.  Anyone have ideas?
2011-06-19T07:47:00.000Z	mekius		I've also googled for help and have seen people have issues, but no useful solutions.
2011-06-19T07:49:00.000Z	mrdeb	mekius	do you know the hotkey to bring up the boot menu during boot for your motherboard
2011-06-19T07:50:00.000Z	mekius		yes, i've used it to turn off splash and queit mode.  I've tried mounting cdrom from busybox, but it gives and 'Invalid Argument' error
2011-06-19T07:53:00.000Z	mekius	mrdeb	i'd rather not have to run home to burn the alt cd, but do you think that is my only option?
2011-06-19T07:54:00.000Z	mrdeb	mekius	to do what
2011-06-19T07:54:00.000Z	mekius		Hmm, dmesg shows 'attempt to access beyond end of device'
2011-06-19T07:55:00.000Z	mekius		to get ubuntu installed...
2011-06-19T07:56:00.000Z	mekius		I mean I cant understand why I'm having so much trouble with a fairly common system from about 3 years ago, quite annoying :/
2011-06-19T07:57:00.000Z	mrdeb	mekius	you dont need alternate cd to get it installed. you need to know what your boot key is
2011-06-19T07:58:00.000Z	mekius		I think you're not understanding my problem, the cd boots fine, but it dumps into busybox when it attempts to boot the live environment.
2011-06-19T07:58:00.000Z	mekius		has nothing
2011-06-19T07:58:00.000Z	mekius		oops
2011-06-19T07:59:00.000Z	mekius		the cdrom works, this machine had windows and it was fine and the cd boots fine
2011-06-19T07:59:00.000Z	mrdeb	mekius	what is busybox
2011-06-19T07:59:00.000Z	mrdeb	mekius	try a usb stick instead
2011-06-19T07:59:00.000Z	mekius		would it matter that i put the iso image on a dvd-r?
2011-06-19T08:00:00.000Z	mrdeb	mekius	maybe cd burning error
