2009-11-06T06:18:00.000Z	major_redhat	hazard9	through bluetooth or wired USB?
2009-11-06T06:19:00.000Z	major_redhat	hazard9	do you already have the bluetooth drivers installed?
2009-11-06T06:20:00.000Z	major_redhat	hazard9	thats ok
2009-11-06T06:20:00.000Z	major_redhat	hazard9	did you enable the cell phone to be discoverable?
2009-11-06T06:21:00.000Z	major_redhat	hazard9	then in the bluetooth menu you should see an option that says "search for devices" or something like that
