2007-09-01T09:54:00.000Z	Kikkomaso		I'm installing Ubuntu on the Same hard drive as Windows, How do I configure my windows drive to have 80GB, and my Ubuntu partition to have 20? (Using the Manual Gparted tool)
2007-09-01T09:56:00.000Z	Kikkomaso		What kind of partition should I write for a Dual-boot with Windows and Edgy on the same hard drive? There are quite a few options.
2007-09-01T09:57:00.000Z	Kikkomaso		Should I make it an ext3 partition?
2007-09-01T09:57:00.000Z	Kikkomaso		:\ Come on, I know there's someone out there waiting for a question to answer :P
2007-09-01T09:58:00.000Z	regeya	Kikkomaso	ext3 is often a good choice
2007-09-01T09:58:00.000Z	Kikkomaso	regeya	Thanks
2007-09-01T09:59:00.000Z	regeya	Kikkomaso	in fact, I just wouldn't recommend reiser.  I held a bit of a grudge long before the murder allegations, so that's not it.  Hans is just too...cocksure.  If you have filesystem corruption, it's a hardware problem.  That sort of thing.
2007-09-01T09:59:00.000Z	Kikkomaso	regeya	o.O
2007-09-01T10:00:00.000Z	regeya	Kikkomaso	I don't know if that's till on the reiserfs faq, but it used to be.
2007-09-01T10:00:00.000Z	Kikkomaso	regeya	It says I could not resize the windows partition to 80gb
2007-09-01T10:00:00.000Z	regeya		still, reiserfs is great for multimedia work.
2007-09-01T10:00:00.000Z	regeya		o-O

2007-09-01T10:01:00.000Z	regeya		weekends!
2007-09-01T10:01:00.000Z	Kikkomaso	regeya	Do you suppose I should use the Automatic resizer?
2007-09-01T10:02:00.000Z	regeya	Kikkomaso	I apologize; I haven't dual-booted literally in years :-( so I can't answer that.  Perhaps someone else can...sorry.
2007-09-01T10:03:00.000Z	Kikkomaso	regeya	Ok, thanks anyway. I myself have just installed on a second hard drive and switched between hard drives: That's not an option anymore ;A;
