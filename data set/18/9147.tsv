2007-05-15T05:13:00.000Z	Filthpig		wow, well hello there faust_! hahah, bloody many years ago!
2007-05-15T05:13:00.000Z	faust_	Filthpig	thought that was you, but you didn't reply in query :)
2007-05-15T05:14:00.000Z	Filthpig		have you queried me? geez, gaim is messy :(
2007-05-15T05:14:00.000Z	faust_	Filthpig	gaim for irc? Install xchat dammit :)
2007-05-15T05:15:00.000Z	Filthpig	faust_	aye, I was wondering why ubuntu does not come with a clean IRC client like kubuntu..
2007-05-15T05:15:00.000Z	Filthpig		I guess KDE is better equipped than gnome..
2007-05-15T05:15:00.000Z	faust_	Filthpig	you know as well as me there IS no clean irc client?
2007-05-15T05:15:00.000Z	faust_		:) even
2007-05-15T05:15:00.000Z	Filthpig		Konversation is very nice, at least :] 
2007-05-15T05:16:00.000Z	faust_		filthpig: Yes, but where some say better equipped, others say bloat :)
2007-05-15T05:16:00.000Z	faust_	Filthpig	still in Molde by the way? Might be headed up that way in a couple of weeks.
2007-05-15T05:17:00.000Z	Filthpig	faust_	well yes.. I guess KDE comes with a lot of stuff you don't need.. but a nice and simple IRC client is good to have around
2007-05-15T05:17:00.000Z	Filthpig	faust_	nope, moved to hamar two years ago :p
2007-05-15T05:18:00.000Z	faust_	Filthpig	see how I pay attention to where friends go? Completely lost here :) Oh, and about KDE, as soon as KDE 4 comes, I'm gonna have a month of trying. Until that, Gnome is my poison. Been a while since KDE was as relaxing and clean :)
2007-05-15T05:19:00.000Z	Filthpig		I'm quite excited about kde4 too.. I've always been using KDE.. until today oO I got tired of my messed up system and decided to to a complete reinstall.. and chose to go for ubuntu instead of kubuntu this time
2007-05-15T05:20:00.000Z	Filthpig		to do*
2007-05-15T05:20:00.000Z	faust_	Filthpig	kubuntu is only an aptitude install away :)
2007-05-15T05:20:00.000Z	Filthpig	faust_	yep, installed ubuntu-desktop from my kubuntu installation too, but all the programs end up in the menus
