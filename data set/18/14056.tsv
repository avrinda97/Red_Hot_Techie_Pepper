2005-09-19T12:56:00.000Z	onkarshinde	Kytten	internal or external modem?
2005-09-19T12:57:00.000Z	onkarshinde	Kytten	Do you know which model?
2005-09-19T12:58:00.000Z	onkarshinde	Kytten	Noramally linux distros doesn't contain modem drivers by default.
2005-09-19T12:59:00.000Z	onkarshinde	Kytten	Search for driver on creative's site.
2005-09-19T13:00:00.000Z	onkarshinde	Kytten	Driver for linux
2005-09-19T13:01:00.000Z	onkarshinde	Kytten	If you are refering to the CD you got with modem, it most probably contains windows only driver. Still see if you can find anything on it?
2005-09-19T13:01:00.000Z	Kytten	onkarshinde	: nothing for ubuntu in it
2005-09-19T13:02:00.000Z	onkarshinde	Kytten	I suppose there isn't any creative driver available. There is high probability that your modem is based on some third party chipset. If you can find out which then it is easy to find driver.
2005-09-19T13:04:00.000Z	Kytten	onkarshinde	: what do u advise me to do
2005-09-19T13:05:00.000Z	onkarshinde	Kytten	There are some scripts available on net that can identify your chipset of modem. Search for them. Then search for the driver according to chippset.
2005-09-19T13:08:00.000Z	onkarshinde	Kytten	Doenload this script. Uncompress it & run it. http://linmodems.technion.ac.il/packages/scanModem.gz
2005-09-19T13:10:00.000Z	onkarshinde	Kytten	It will tell you the chipset of your modem.
2005-09-19T13:14:00.000Z	onkarshinde	Kytten	You should then probably look into this site http://linmodems.technion.ac.il/
2005-09-19T13:15:00.000Z	onkarshinde	Kytten	Going for lunch. Will get back in some time.
