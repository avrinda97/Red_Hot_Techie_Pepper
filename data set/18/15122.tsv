2005-05-15T16:10:00.000Z	transgress	os|gaz	add it to /etc/fstab
2005-05-15T16:13:00.000Z	transgress	os|gaz	i do... you gotta enable multiverse
2005-05-15T16:16:00.000Z	transgress	os|gaz	if you want i can find you the wiki on installing libdvdcss2 and w32codecs

2005-05-15T16:18:00.000Z	transgress	os|gaz	plus i'm pretty.
2005-05-15T16:32:00.000Z	transgress	os|gaz	it's not there... you gotta add it to /etc/apt/sources.list
2005-05-15T16:33:00.000Z	transgress	os|gaz	wait you are running amd64 aren't you?
2005-05-15T16:34:00.000Z	transgress	os|gaz	okay well w32codecs won't work for you w/o some effort... so just get libdvdcss2 (which i didn't need marillat for on amd64)  just multiverse
2005-05-15T16:35:00.000Z	transgress	os|gaz	i am pretty sure i got it from multiverse on ubuntu on amd64, because i never added marillat to that box, but i sure as hell have it
