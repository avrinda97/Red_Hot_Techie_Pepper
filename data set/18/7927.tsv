2007-10-25T19:47:00.000Z	dt06pe3		Hello! I installed Ubuntu on my laptop, and now I cant get Windows to boot with Grub. Windows is _not_ on the first partition as some say it should be. Is it possible to do it anyways?
2007-10-25T19:48:00.000Z	Dr_willis	dt06pe3	 check your 'sudo fdisk -l' layout  - it may be on the 2nd partition.
2007-10-25T19:49:00.000Z	Dr_willis	dt06pe3	 on a gateway laptop ive seen. first partition is a recovery tool. 2nd is actual windows. We put linux on 3rd+
2007-10-25T19:49:00.000Z	dt06pe3	Dr_willis	its on the fourth...
2007-10-25T19:49:00.000Z	Dr_willis	dt06pe3	 edit the grub menu.lst file then to have a proper entry. actually the installer normally puts an entry in for every windows type partition it sees.
2007-10-25T19:49:00.000Z	dt06pe3	Dr_willis	I installed windows long time ago, when I had linux installed, which means that it was put "at the end" of the hdd
2007-10-25T19:50:00.000Z	Dr_willis	dt06pe3	  Interesting.. Ive found that a good learning of the ins and outs of grub. is well worth the effort. :)
2007-10-25T19:50:00.000Z	dt06pe3	Dr_willis	there was none.. is there some command to make it probe?
2007-10-25T19:50:00.000Z	Dr_willis	dt06pe3	 i know of no command that 'rescans' the whole system like the installer does.
2007-10-25T19:51:00.000Z	Dr_willis	dt06pe3	 teres an examaple entry for windows on hda1, you can uncomment it and change what drive it looks for easially however.
2007-10-25T19:53:00.000Z	dt06pe3	Dr_willis	say I have win xp installed on fourth partition, could you be so kind to pm me what you think it should look like?
2007-10-25T19:53:00.000Z	Dr_willis	dt06pe3	 4th partition of hda? if so it will be like hd0,3
2007-10-25T19:54:00.000Z	dt06pe3	Dr_willis	should I use root or rootnoverify?
2007-10-25T19:54:00.000Z	Dr_willis	dt06pe3	 for wimndows partitions you alwyas use rootnoverify i belive
2007-10-25T19:54:00.000Z	dt06pe3	Dr_willis	I also have makeactive and chainloader +1, is there something I forgot?
2007-10-25T19:55:00.000Z	Dr_willis	dt06pe3	  No idea. Ijust uncomment that example for my system.  and it works.  theres like 4 lines you uncomment.
2007-10-25T19:57:00.000Z	dt06pe3	Dr_willis	I get Error 13: Invalid or unsupported executable format..
2007-10-25T19:58:00.000Z	Dr_willis	dt06pe3	 i would have to say check the grub docs/guides.   proberly a typo/error somewhere.
