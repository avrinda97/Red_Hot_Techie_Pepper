2011-08-09T01:50:00.000Z	natschil	Jordan_U	what about /lib/ ?
2011-08-09T01:51:00.000Z	natschil	Jordan_U	thanks.
2011-08-09T01:52:00.000Z	Jordan_U	natschil	That said, you will usually be prompted on every package update which modifies that file if you want to replace the file, keep the current one, try a merge etc.
2011-08-09T01:52:00.000Z	Jordan_U	natschil	Files in /lib/ I believe will always be replaced, unless you use dpkg-divert to explicitly prevent that for a given file.
2011-08-09T01:53:00.000Z	Jordan_U	natschil	What is your actual problem?
2011-08-09T01:53:00.000Z	natschil	Jordan_U	I see, dpkg-divert may be my friend. let me look at the man page.
2011-08-09T01:53:00.000Z	natschil	Jordan_U	that I have a modification to a file in /lib/ that is essential to the system, but that I still want security updates to be appliable to the file, for example.
2011-08-09T01:55:00.000Z	Jordan_U	natschil	Please describe your exact situation in detail.
2011-08-09T01:56:00.000Z	natschil	Jordan_U	that is my exact situation. Take it as a premise that I need to modify a script in /lib, and that these modifications need to be persistent, and that I am now wondering about how security updates can still be applied.
2011-08-09T01:56:00.000Z	Jordan_U	natschil	What file in /lib needs to be modified, how, and why?
2011-08-09T01:57:00.000Z	natschil	Jordan_U	that is irrelevant.
2011-08-09T01:59:00.000Z	Jordan_U	natschil	No, it's not. Many questions don't have a generic answer, and this seems like one of them. I cannot help you without specific details. Please read: http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html#goal
2011-08-09T02:02:00.000Z	natschil	Jordan_U	ok. Imagine that I am modifying /lib/bridge-utils/bridge-utils.sh to include a line at the start that logs something. I want this line at the start to stay there despite security updates.
2011-08-09T02:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	natschil	log what?
2011-08-09T02:04:00.000Z	natschil	Jordan_U	say whenever the script was run. say it simply ran echo "The script was run" >> /var/log/some_file somewhere in the middle. sorry that I am not able to give you the exact problem, but I have my reasons for doing so.
2011-08-09T02:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	natschil	1: As long as you are starting your question with "Say I want to do X", rather than "I actually am trying to do X" I think you are missing the point. 2: I need to leave now.
2011-08-09T02:07:00.000Z	natschil	Jordan_U	look if you dont know the answer to the specific problem I have then that's fine, I do not want a way to solve the general problem, but a way to solve the specific problem of a small change to a script in /lib/ to be persistent even if there is a security update that changes the script. thanks for the help though.
