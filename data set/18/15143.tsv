2005-04-29T12:51:00.000Z	hobocop		amazing
2005-04-29T12:51:00.000Z	yfir	hobocop	ofcourse, but you might want gftp if you need something graphical
2005-04-29T13:41:00.000Z	yfir	hobocop	liferea is an rss(etc.) feed reader. available in universe/multiverse repos
2005-04-29T13:41:00.000Z	yfir	hobocop	i use it, it's quite nice
2005-04-29T13:44:00.000Z	yfir	hobocop	not sure if you like this sort of thing, but root-tail is quite cool
2005-04-29T13:45:00.000Z	yfir	hobocop	displays logs in your root window. might not work well if you use nautilus to draw your desktop though
2005-04-29T13:45:00.000Z	yfir	hobocop	yes
2005-04-29T13:45:00.000Z	yfir	hobocop	easy to switch off, but you'll lose right=click context menu on the desktop (and other such things)
2005-04-29T13:46:00.000Z	hobocop	yfir	I think I will keep it, but thanks for the recomendation
