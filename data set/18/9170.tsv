2007-04-30T05:39:00.000Z	Flannel	hulky	udf is readable normally.  just mount it (-t udf)
2007-04-30T05:40:00.000Z	hulky	Flannel	doesn't work
2007-04-30T05:41:00.000Z	hulky	Flannel	mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/cdrom,
2007-04-30T05:41:00.000Z	Flannel	hulky	try iso9660
2007-04-30T05:41:00.000Z	hulky	Flannel	nope
2007-04-30T05:41:00.000Z	hulky	Flannel	i copied the first mb of the cdrom into a file
2007-04-30T05:41:00.000Z	hulky	Flannel	"file" shows it as "data"
2007-04-30T05:41:00.000Z	hulky	Flannel	i ran strings on the data and it has some junk about UDF in there
