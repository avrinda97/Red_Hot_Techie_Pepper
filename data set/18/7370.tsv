2009-11-11T14:07:00.000Z	billy		can anyone tell me is 800x600 resolution all that is available 9.10
2009-11-11T14:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	billy	yes if you dont configure video drivers
2009-11-13T02:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	billy	depends on requirements
2009-11-13T02:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	billy	neither is better
2009-11-13T02:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	billy	XAMPP has an X server
2009-11-13T02:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	billy	LAMP is obviuously a good choice as you are not running an X server which makes it more secure and use less resources
2009-11-13T02:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	billy	i'd advise LAMP, keep it pure
2009-11-13T02:28:00.000Z	billy	ActionParsnip	What do you mean?
2009-11-13T02:29:00.000Z	billy	ActionParsnip	What do you mean by "pure"?
2009-11-13T02:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	billy	i'd look at what they mean, i'm going to
2009-11-13T02:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	billy	the X just means any OS, so its generic, You can make MAMPP by using it on a Mac, It covers all bases
2009-11-13T02:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	billy	so you can install ubuntu then install LAMP on it and get the desired effect
2010-08-29T12:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	billy	use an audio app like banshee and it may stop it. Or log a bug
2010-08-29T12:42:00.000Z	billy	ActionParsnip	the bug was reported years ago and has been ignored effectively - i dont use banshee for file management
2010-08-29T12:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	billy	could use a different filemanager then maybe
2010-08-29T12:43:00.000Z	billy	ActionParsnip	the whole desktop management is in nautilus if my understanding is correct - i dont want to do a major rewrite of the system
2010-08-29T12:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	billy	its not. You are just going to install another browser. Its not rewriting anything at all
2010-08-29T12:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	billy	you can have nautilus manage the desktop stuff and manage files with thunar if you like. You can install rox and konqueror too if the fancy takes you
