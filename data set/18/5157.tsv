2008-12-01T17:30:00.000Z	voicu		?
2008-12-01T17:31:00.000Z	voicu		derkater: does enter work in any other contexts?
2008-12-01T17:31:00.000Z	voicu		bullgarde4: i need something permanent
2008-12-01T17:31:00.000Z	DerKater	voicu	thanks for answering, the enter button works in any F-key submenu
2008-12-01T17:32:00.000Z	DerKater	voicu	I'm running the cd within VMWare too
2008-12-01T17:33:00.000Z	DerKater	voicu	its the latest Ubuntu 8.10 Server edition
2008-12-01T17:39:00.000Z	DerKater	voicu	ok thx, I'm going to try something else... I saw an option in the install menu saying Virtual Machine or something
2008-12-01T17:39:00.000Z	DerKater	voicu	also, I can access the non-graphical installer, how does it work?
2008-12-01T17:40:00.000Z	DerKater	voicu	well i get "boot:" what do I type?
2008-12-01T17:41:00.000Z	DerKater	voicu	ok now I get invalid or corrupt kernel image... :)    I think I just need to redownload the image
2008-12-01T17:41:00.000Z	DerKater	voicu	the graphical version did not show me that error message
2008-12-01T17:42:00.000Z	DerKater	voicu	not a bad idea is there a torrent file on ubuntu.com or do I have to search on piratebay?
2008-12-01T17:42:00.000Z	DerKater	voicu	thank you so much for your help :)
2008-12-01T17:44:00.000Z	DerKater	voicu	got it! and its even faster than the other downloads
2008-12-01T17:45:00.000Z	DerKater	voicu	basically i'm installing ubuntu so I can start a vmware in it to install windows small business server inside linux
2008-12-01T17:46:00.000Z	DerKater	voicu	that way I will be able to VNC into linux and always be able to see the damn server console as if I was in front of it. Because you know SBS always disconnects you when you change something and then you have to ask someone to get on the server and click somewhere
2008-12-01T17:46:00.000Z	DerKater	voicu	ok thanks alot voicu
