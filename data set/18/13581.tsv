2006-09-28T05:05:00.000Z	LjL	Dr_willis	sergo: i believe it's "--prefix=/usr", or "--prefix=/usr/bin"
2006-10-01T16:10:00.000Z	LjL	Dr_willis	she *installed* from the live cd, i think
2006-10-08T09:59:00.000Z	LjL	Dr_willis	well, freenode is a bit annoying as well. if it doesn't get an ident response (and it can't from me, since i'm behind NAT), it just hangs for an annoyingly long time
2006-10-08T09:59:00.000Z	LjL	Dr_willis	(actually, for so long that a few irc clients just time out and assume they can't connect)
2006-10-08T09:59:00.000Z	Dr_willis	LjL	 ive noticed the opposite effect.. windows version of xchat has identd. and takes forever to connect.. linux xchat connects almost idmnetaly
2006-10-15T11:41:00.000Z	LjL	Dr_willis	10? :)
2006-10-15T11:46:00.000Z	Dr_willis	LjL	 Neither do I.
2007-02-10T11:54:00.000Z	LjL	Dr_willis	i think it's still just the burden from users downloading the new kernel. rememeber it all comes from security
2007-02-10T11:54:00.000Z	Dr_willis	LjL	 i dident even SEE a kernel update listed in my updates. :) perhaps the server was so overloaded it got skipped
2007-02-10T11:55:00.000Z	LjL	Dr_willis	edgy, 2.6.17-10 to 2.6.17-11, and being quite a nuisance (first, they broke the dependencies - now they've fixed the dependencies, but everyone who has "bleeding edge" nvidia/ati drivers has their X, of course, broken)
2007-03-06T11:43:00.000Z	LjL	Dr_willis	so not using the kernel that came in the ISO, i'd assume?
2007-04-18T10:42:00.000Z	LjL	Dr_willis	aw, what a smart client that was
2007-04-18T10:43:00.000Z	Dr_willis	LjL	 i forget now.. I think it may of been some IM client.
2007-04-18T10:43:00.000Z	LjL	Dr_willis	well it's a darn good idea anyway
2007-04-20T09:49:00.000Z	LjL	Dr_willis	err, but that error would mean that there is no DNS record... and i get it too
2007-04-20T09:49:00.000Z	Dr_willis	LjL	 perhaps they all got used up. :) heh heh... odd.. that does sound like a dns server issue.
2007-05-25T07:19:00.000Z	Dr_willis	LjL	 heh - glad im not the only one - thats never heard of them
2007-05-25T07:20:00.000Z	LjL	Dr_willis	actually i lied, i stumbled across them on a DVD player... still i hardly know what they are
