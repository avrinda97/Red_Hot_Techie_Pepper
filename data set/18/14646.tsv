2005-06-30T11:13:00.000Z	joachim		anyone using liferea?
2005-06-30T11:14:00.000Z	thoreauputic	joachim	yes
2005-06-30T11:52:00.000Z	thoreauputic	joachim	just use xscreensaver to lock the desktop
2005-06-30T11:59:00.000Z	thoreauputic	joachim	it should use the gnome widgets
2005-06-30T11:59:00.000Z	thoreauputic	joachim	did you upgrade from warty without ubuntu desktop installed?
2005-06-30T12:00:00.000Z	joachim	thoreauputic	yes, I think so -- the ubuntudesktop package got removed ages ago in a werid dependency glitch
2005-06-30T12:00:00.000Z	thoreauputic	joachim	I would reinstall it and see if that helps
2005-06-30T12:01:00.000Z	thoreauputic	joachim	there's a gnome package for OOo as well
2005-06-30T12:03:00.000Z	thoreauputic	joachim	you probably still have warty versions of things
2005-06-30T12:03:00.000Z	joachim	thoreauputic	I ran a smart update off the hoary CD though
2005-06-30T12:19:00.000Z	joachim	thoreauputic	you were right. it's fixed OOo's widgets!
2005-06-30T12:20:00.000Z	thoreauputic	joachim	I thought it might ;) Great !
2005-06-30T12:24:00.000Z	thoreauputic	joachim	shouldn't - unless the updgraded version doesn't like them
2005-06-30T12:25:00.000Z	thoreauputic	joachim	try ` sudo apt-get -f install ` without any packages
2005-06-30T12:26:00.000Z	joachim	thoreauputic	I get the same error
2005-06-30T12:27:00.000Z	thoreauputic	joachim	do you have a backport version of firefox or a 3rd party version?
2005-06-30T12:27:00.000Z	joachim	thoreauputic	when I was on warty I installed the latest FF in my home folder
2005-06-30T12:28:00.000Z	thoreauputic	joachim	that shouldn't matter - but that error suggests a conflict of versions
