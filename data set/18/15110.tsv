2007-09-02T05:05:00.000Z	edulix		I've reading this bsd thing. I've never taked a deep look at bsd license, but now that I have, I have some doubts..
2007-09-02T05:07:00.000Z	edulix		so it seems that if I redistribute a software that is under bsd, I can choose to do whatever I want with it, i.e. I can just not release the source code. but if I choose to release it, its license must remain being bsd?
2007-09-02T05:07:00.000Z	Anlar	edulix	sure, but that's not a license issue but a copyright holding issue
2007-09-02T05:07:00.000Z	Anlar	edulix	the one who actually wrote the code is the only one with the rights to change that anyways
2007-09-02T05:09:00.000Z	edulix	Anlar	well the BSD developer could have released the code to the public domain, and then anyone could put any license to it
2007-09-02T05:09:00.000Z	Anlar	edulix	it's just a technicality, software has been changed from bsd to gpl and vice versa, sometimes requiring just some little extra work
2007-09-02T05:10:00.000Z	Anlar	edulix	including ie. gpl, which would be bad
2007-09-02T05:10:00.000Z	edulix	Anlar	it seems I had a wrong view of the BSD license =) I thought it was so "open" that allowed you even to change the license (as you can do with public domain code right?)
2007-09-02T05:11:00.000Z	Anlar	edulix	yes. however bsd is a good license, there is no really need to convert away from it
2007-09-02T05:12:00.000Z	edulix	Anlar	well that depends on personal preferences. I prefer GPL, you prefer BSD =) I was just trying to understand BSD better
2007-09-02T05:12:00.000Z	edulix	Anlar	thanks for your help in that ;)
2007-09-02T05:12:00.000Z	Anlar	edulix	it's not really "personal preferences".. the an other one is bad for innovation, and the other one is not.
2007-09-02T05:14:00.000Z	edulix	Anlar	that's what you think, but I don't think so. How good is for innovation to be able to close some source code? I think that imposing that source must be released is better for innovation
2007-09-02T05:14:00.000Z	Anlar	edulix	investment is the base of innovation. time, resources, money. the other one fosters that, the other one not. all the "brightest stars" of gpl software have done so far (on relevant areas) is aping
2007-09-02T05:15:00.000Z	edulix	Anlar	what code do you prefer, the one you can't have acces to, or the one you have access to? developmet is incremental, you develop X, I modify it, then you add some more new modifications...
2007-09-02T05:16:00.000Z	Anlar	edulix	code is the lowest level just as the coders are the lowest scum of all it people :)
2007-09-02T05:17:00.000Z	edulix	Anlar	aping? hell yeah!  I told you, innovation is incremental in software. you don't just start from scratch in software
