2012-04-03T09:42:00.000Z	astropirate		I get a  "Permission denied (publickey)"  when i try to ssh into my ubuntu server... what could cause this? my public key is already in authorized_keys file
2012-04-03T09:43:00.000Z	Agent_bob	astropirate	ummm permission issue on the file ~/.ssh/*
2012-04-03T09:43:00.000Z	Agent_bob		ls -l
2012-04-03T09:47:00.000Z	astropirate	Agent_bob	the permissions for all the files are -rw-r--r--
2012-04-03T09:48:00.000Z	astropirate	Agent_bob	is that what its suppose to be?
2012-04-03T09:48:00.000Z	astropirate		ohh and they are owned by root
2012-04-03T09:49:00.000Z	Agent_bob	astropirate	  no.   you should own them and they should not be readable by anyone else.
2012-04-03T09:49:00.000Z	Agent_bob	astropirate	  also the dir itself
2012-04-03T09:50:00.000Z	astropirate	Agent_bob	I am root. (i'm still setting it up)
2012-04-03T09:50:00.000Z	astropirate		but is this really what's causing me to not be able to log in?
2012-04-03T09:50:00.000Z	astropirate		*ssh in
2012-04-03T09:51:00.000Z	Agent_bob	astropirate	  not sure...    but ssh will not read config files that are toooooo permisc.
2012-04-03T09:51:00.000Z	Agent_bob		and for good reason.
2012-04-03T09:51:00.000Z	astropirate		what should I chmod them to?
2012-04-03T09:51:00.000Z	Agent_bob		the dir   to      700   the files to    600
2012-04-03T09:52:00.000Z	Agent_bob		actually as root      000   will work.   root needs no permission at all.
2012-04-03T09:52:00.000Z	Agent_bob		but the former is propper
2012-04-03T09:53:00.000Z	astropirate	Agent_bob	woot WOoOOOTTTT!! :d :D :D
