2009-11-10T10:26:00.000Z	kostkon	Qballjos	post the one line output here
2009-11-10T10:27:00.000Z	kostkon	Qballjos	ok, can you now give: aplay -l.

2009-11-10T10:28:00.000Z	kostkon	Qballjos	ok. what problem do you have exactly?
2009-11-10T10:29:00.000Z	kostkon	Qballjos	did you go to system → preferences  → sound to setup your audio?
2009-11-10T10:30:00.000Z	kostkon	Qballjos	if you open a player, does it play but you don't hear anything or do you get an error?

2009-11-10T10:30:00.000Z	kostkon	Qballjos	did you try all the profiles in the sound prefs. i.e. system → prefs → sound?
2009-11-10T10:33:00.000Z	kostkon	Qballjos	could you give in a terminal: alsamixer and check your volume levels there
2009-11-10T10:34:00.000Z	kostkon	Qballjos	any muted channels?
