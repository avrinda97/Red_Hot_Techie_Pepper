2010-01-07T09:13:00.000Z	nonexks		if i run live cd on my laptop will that let me know if all the drivers are avalible ?
2010-01-07T09:14:00.000Z	Hammerjak	nonexks	what do you mean?
2010-01-07T09:15:00.000Z	nonexks	Hammerjak	well i have a ton of drivers needed to run all the hardware on this laptop and i dont know if linux will work on it
2010-01-07T09:16:00.000Z	Hammerjak	nonexks	ah, yeah, if the live cd works fine, the install will use the same drivers
2010-01-07T09:16:00.000Z	nonexks	Hammerjak	so how would i make a list of everthing i will need ?
2010-01-07T09:17:00.000Z	Hammerjak	nonexks	whatever drivers the live cd decides to use should be the same that the installed version will use
2010-01-07T09:19:00.000Z	Hammerjak	nonexks	you can use a less graphically-intensive window manager like xfce
2010-01-07T09:19:00.000Z	Hammerjak	nonexks	that is, instal Xubuntu rather than plain Ubuntu
2010-01-07T09:21:00.000Z	Hammerjak	nonexks	once ubuntu is installed, go to System -> Preferences -> Appearance, then 'Visual Effects' tab and choose "extra"
2010-01-07T09:21:00.000Z	Hammerjak	nonexks	that will enable compiz
2010-01-07T09:23:00.000Z	Hammerjak	nonexks	that depends on what video driver the live cd chooses, typically you have to install Ubuntu and on the first boot it will ask if you want to use a "restricted" driver
2010-01-07T09:23:00.000Z	Hammerjak	nonexks	the restricted driver will support 3d rendering
2010-01-07T09:23:00.000Z	Hammerjak	nonexks	yep :)
2010-01-07T09:25:00.000Z	nonexks	Hammerjak	so i tryed to install ubuntu on this notebook a while back and it never worked ... do you know of any bios issues that would cause this
2010-01-07T09:25:00.000Z	Hammerjak	nonexks	sorry, no, there are lots of things that can go wrong with laptop drivers, can't help you there
2010-01-07T09:25:00.000Z	nonexks	Hammerjak	ok thank you very much
2010-01-07T09:27:00.000Z	Hammerjak	nonexks	ubuntu, Xubuntu is if you have a really old system
2010-01-07T09:29:00.000Z	Hammerjak	nonexks	ubuntu 9.10 is the current version, it's up to you if that's the 'best' :)
