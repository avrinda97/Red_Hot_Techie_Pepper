2011-02-15T20:59:00.000Z	danub		hey all. how do I get rid of my ssh banners?
2011-02-15T21:00:00.000Z	danub		hello?
2011-02-15T21:02:00.000Z	danub		ok, got that squared away. thank you ActionParsnip . next question. when I enter the username, it takes about 6 seconds before i get prompted for a password
2011-02-15T21:02:00.000Z	danub		other systems I use ssh on (granted they are redhat enterprise), its instantaneous
2011-02-15T21:02:00.000Z	danub		is there some setting that is making it wait 5 or 6 seconds before prompting for password?
2011-02-15T21:03:00.000Z	danub		how do i check?
2011-02-15T21:04:00.000Z	danub		uname -a?
2011-02-15T21:04:00.000Z	danub		9.10
2011-02-15T21:04:00.000Z	danub		wait... shouldn't i be at 10 something...
2011-02-15T21:04:00.000Z	danub		time to dist-upgrade me thinks
2011-02-15T21:05:00.000Z	Pici	danub	dist-upgrade isn't the proper way to upgrade to a new release.
2011-02-15T21:05:00.000Z	danub	Pici	what the new way to upgrade?
2011-02-15T21:05:00.000Z	Pici	danub	either update-manager -c or do-release-upgrade -c
2011-02-15T21:05:00.000Z	Pici	danub	First is gui, second is cli.
2011-02-15T21:09:00.000Z	Pici	danub	Try -p then.
2011-02-15T21:10:00.000Z	Pici	danub	It'll prompt you if it needs to replace any of our /etc/ files.
2011-07-28T23:55:00.000Z	Pici	danub	Network shares shouldn't be mounted as ntfs3g.  Check the output of 'mount'
