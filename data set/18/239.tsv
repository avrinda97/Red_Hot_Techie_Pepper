2012-05-27T15:44:00.000Z	Eagleman		still
2012-05-27T15:44:00.000Z	Eagleman		exlude isnt working
2012-05-27T15:44:00.000Z	Eagleman		 tar -cvpzf /media/usbbackupdisk/backup.tar.gz --exclude = /media/hdd1/Backups/  /media/hdd1
2012-05-27T15:45:00.000Z	Eagleman		it is still backing up backups ...
2012-05-27T15:45:00.000Z	Eagleman		with my new command?
2012-05-27T15:46:00.000Z	Eagleman		its writing the backup to an external usb disk
2012-05-27T15:47:00.000Z	Eagleman		am i not using --exclude right?
2012-05-27T15:49:00.000Z	Eagleman		Walex told me it wasnt smart to place a backup on the same disk
2012-05-27T15:49:00.000Z	Eagleman		so now i'm using this command:
2012-05-27T15:49:00.000Z	Eagleman		tar -cvpzf /media/usbbackupdisk/backup.tar.gz --exclude=/media/hdd1/Backups/  /media/hdd1
2012-05-27T15:50:00.000Z	Walex	Eagleman	yes, because of two reasons: same disk means that if the disk fails, you lose both original and backup; and also backing up to the same disk i very slow as the disk arm must travel twice.
2012-05-27T15:50:00.000Z	Walex	Eagleman	if you have two external disks one strategy could be to backup each to the other.
2012-05-27T16:03:00.000Z	Walex	Eagleman	multiple --exclude or a list of names in a file and '--exclude-from'
2012-05-27T16:04:00.000Z	Walex	Eagleman	or you could use 'find' to select what you want backed up with '--file-from=-'
2012-05-27T16:06:00.000Z	Walex	Eagleman	then it may be useful for you to put on the disk a file with list of places you don't want to backup and then use '--exclude-from=...'
2012-05-27T16:18:00.000Z	Eagleman	Walex	if i put this information inside a file (Location: /media/hdd1/Backups/Backupfile ) /media/hdd1/Downloads/Dropbox/* and then use --exclude-from=/media/hdd1/Backups/Backupfile it will not backup dropbox right?
2012-05-27T16:24:00.000Z	Walex	Eagleman	probably depends on the content of that file, and what "isnt this working" means.
2012-05-27T16:26:00.000Z	Walex	Eagleman	if it tells you that file does not exist then it does not exist. Try 'ls -ld /media/hdd1/Backup/BackupExclude'
