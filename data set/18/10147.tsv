2007-10-20T08:14:00.000Z	biggahed		hello there. Im trying gutsy amd64. Is there any 'it sucks huge amounts of ram' issue known?
2007-10-20T08:16:00.000Z	biggahed		i might open a bug report then... 850+ running almost nothing is too much
2007-10-20T08:17:00.000Z	biggahed		its not something like app x is using humungous amounts of ram. The system as a whole is
2007-10-20T08:17:00.000Z	astro76	biggahed	in a terminal type free -m, what is the number under cached?
2007-10-20T08:18:00.000Z	biggahed	astro76	-/+ buffers/cache:        847       1166
2007-10-20T08:18:00.000Z	astro76	biggahed	no the first row that says Mem:
2007-10-20T08:18:00.000Z	astro76	biggahed	last value on that row
2007-10-20T08:19:00.000Z	biggahed	astro76	936
2007-10-20T08:20:00.000Z	astro76	biggahed	when ram is not being used in Linux, it is used as a disk cache to speed up your system, and is freed immediately when needed
2007-10-20T08:20:00.000Z	astro76	biggahed	so you see Linux handles memory much differently than Windows, and your system is fine ;)
2007-10-20T08:23:00.000Z	biggahed	astro76	im not a just converted linux user. Been using it for 6-7 years by now, so i know some of the diferences. But ive used some other amd64 bits distros and none of them ever used such a huge amount of ram for nothing.
2007-10-20T08:25:00.000Z	astro76	biggahed	well you shouldn't take offense as it's a very common new user question... but if it's used as cache it's not being used for nothing, and you have to consider used-cached as the true amount of used ram
2007-10-20T08:26:00.000Z	biggahed	astro76	none taken :) im just puzzled by this weird behavior. For me at least. I dont see the i386 version caching so agressively
2007-10-20T08:28:00.000Z	astro76	biggahed	on i386 Feisty, I have 2026 total, 1961 used, 65 free, but 1489 is cached
2007-10-20T08:29:00.000Z	biggahed	astro76	i was folowing the whole development of the i386 from tribe3. ive never seen it use more than 700mb of the 2gb i have in here(and thats with a firefox running for a long time). This is weird... anyways... lets see how things go in the next days
2007-10-20T08:31:00.000Z	astro76	biggahed	could this be an improvement then? ;) as far as I know taking advantage of unused ram as disk cache is desirable
2007-10-20T08:31:00.000Z	astro76	biggahed	or am I missing something?
2007-10-20T08:32:00.000Z	biggahed	astro76	i dunno... im thinking some lib compiles got screwed somehow
