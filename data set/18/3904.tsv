2009-07-08T00:41:00.000Z	th3seaw0lf		anybody has any idea, i can explain in detail if anyone wants
2009-07-08T00:41:00.000Z	Halitech	th3seaw0lf	add an alias in your hosts file
2009-07-08T00:42:00.000Z	Halitech	th3seaw0lf	add a line to /etc/hosts where the ip address of the server is first and then mast ie 192.168.0.100 masti
2009-07-08T00:46:00.000Z	Halitech	th3seaw0lf	did you restart networking?
2009-07-08T00:48:00.000Z	Halitech	th3seaw0lf	did you restart the network?
2009-07-08T00:49:00.000Z	Halitech	th3seaw0lf	you need to restart the network to have it take effect
2009-07-08T00:50:00.000Z	th3seaw0lf	Halitech	: i dont know the IP adress of the server.
2009-07-08T00:53:00.000Z	Halitech	th3seaw0lf	is it on your network?
2009-07-08T00:54:00.000Z	th3seaw0lf	Halitech	 the website is on the network, but firefox looks on the internet
2009-07-08T00:55:00.000Z	Halitech	th3seaw0lf	and when you modify your hosts file it will check that first and see that it is supposed to look internally and open the server and not take you to masti.com
2009-07-08T00:55:00.000Z	Halitech	th3seaw0lf	do you have physical access to the server?
2009-07-08T00:56:00.000Z	Halitech	th3seaw0lf	can you ask the admin of the network what the IP address is?
2009-09-15T19:38:00.000Z	Halitech	th3seaw0lf	if its the same as the Dell optiplex I had, its an ISA based sound card and I found it easier to install a PCI sound card
2009-09-15T19:38:00.000Z	Halitech	th3seaw0lf	does it show up in lspci?
2009-09-15T19:40:00.000Z	Halitech	th3seaw0lf	then its probably an isa based card which means getting a PCI sound card would be easier
2009-09-15T19:41:00.000Z	th3seaw0lf	Halitech	now soundcard then? ok :/
2009-09-15T19:43:00.000Z	Halitech	th3seaw0lf	there is info here (older though so may not work) http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=156334 and https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HowToSetupSoundCards?highlight=%28sound%29
