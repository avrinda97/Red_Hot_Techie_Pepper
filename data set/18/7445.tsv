2008-03-19T23:22:00.000Z	Starnestommy	bluebanana	run ifconfig and it should show you a list

2008-03-19T23:24:00.000Z	Starnestommy	bluebanana	try checking the logs in /var/log
2008-03-19T23:25:00.000Z	bluebanana	Starnestommy	which logs?
2008-03-19T23:25:00.000Z	Starnestommy	bluebanana	auth.log is one
2008-03-19T23:27:00.000Z	bluebanana	Starnestommy	http://pastebin.ca/949360 <--ifconfig output. I can't figure out which is the device i'm using
2008-03-19T23:29:00.000Z	bluebanana	Starnestommy	i'm trying to do something like "sudo ifdown eth0 && sudo ifup eth0" to avoid my DNS Server settings being revoked after a reboot. (https://www.opendns.com/start?device=ubuntu#step1)
2008-03-19T23:29:00.000Z	Starnestommy	bluebanana	ath0.  It's the only one that has an IP that isn't 127.0.0.1
2008-03-19T23:30:00.000Z	bluebanana	Starnestommy	 http://pastebin.ca/949367 <-- not configured?
2008-03-20T00:23:00.000Z	Starnestommy	bluebanana	a path or url
2008-03-22T12:33:00.000Z	Starnestommy	bluebanana	grub probably wouldn't recognize it
2008-03-22T12:33:00.000Z	bluebanana	Starnestommy	unop, thanks. but why then are "/dev/sda" and "dev/sda1" in the dropdown list for "device for boot loader installation"?
