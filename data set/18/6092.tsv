2009-08-27T23:00:00.000Z	coz_	WebcamWonder	 it should prevent apt  from not showing them and of course in synaptic
2009-08-27T23:00:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	coz_	*sigh*... what is the apt-get to check for the policy to upgrade packages?
2009-08-27T23:01:00.000Z	coz_	WebcamWonder	 mm not sure what you mean   ...
2009-08-27T23:02:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	coz_	Well, I have a package locked to a specific version and aptitude full-upgrade wants to update it
2009-08-27T23:02:00.000Z	coz_	WebcamWonder	  try  apt-get  to see if it recognizes  the lock
2009-08-27T23:03:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	coz_	Nope
2009-08-27T23:03:00.000Z	coz_	WebcamWonder	 mmm apt-get should recognize that   ... I am not sure then...generally when locking a package in synaptic  it should not be seen
