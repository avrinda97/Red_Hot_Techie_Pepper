2010-08-24T03:20:00.000Z	cgroza		Anyone knows how to fix an identation error?
2010-08-24T03:20:00.000Z	cgroza		in python
2010-08-24T03:20:00.000Z	cgroza		?
2010-08-24T03:21:00.000Z	cgroza		Anyone knows how to fix an identation error: expected ident error?
2010-08-24T03:23:00.000Z	cgroza		Anyone knows how to fix an identation error: expected idented block?
2010-08-24T03:23:00.000Z	cgroza		in python
2010-08-24T03:23:00.000Z	trism	cgroza	indentation is part of the syntax in python, you need to make sure you indent your blocks with the same number of spaces or tabs so they match, or python will not be able to interpret it correctly, you'll probably find more help in #python
2010-08-24T03:23:00.000Z	trism	cgroza	although if you pastebin the file, I'll take a look
2010-08-24T03:24:00.000Z	cgroza	trism	thankyou, i will pastebin the file. thanks very much
2010-08-24T03:25:00.000Z	cgroza	trism	http://pastebin.com/9SzxbwbX
2010-08-24T03:26:00.000Z	cgroza	trism	there is a link, also, im a begginer
2010-08-24T03:33:00.000Z	trism	cgroza	definitely incorrect indentation, but I'm not sure of a straightforward way to fix it because of all the inner function definitions, that seem like they will never be called. Only tip I can give is that you need to remember to indent every line after each block that you want to be part of the block, such as the if statements, and function definitions
2010-08-24T03:33:00.000Z	cgroza		ok, thanks
2010-08-24T03:36:00.000Z	trism	cgroza	you should really separate the perimeter/volume/surface functions, they can each recursively call selection (although python has a very low recursion limit, so generally not a great idea), and modify selection call perimeter/surface/volume depending on the input
2010-08-24T03:52:00.000Z	trism	cgroza	more like this http://pastebin.com/7GkL4Mjz although I would remove the recursion and use an infinite loop instead, so you don't hit the limit
2010-08-24T03:53:00.000Z	cgroza	trism	thank you
2010-08-24T03:54:00.000Z	cgroza	trism	thank you for your time
