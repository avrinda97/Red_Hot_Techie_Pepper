2012-01-04T20:06:00.000Z	Matan_		hey folks
2012-01-04T20:07:00.000Z	Matan_		I'm trying to install Ubuntu alongside Windows on my new laptop
2012-01-04T20:07:00.000Z	Matan_		but I'm having problem with the paratitioning
2012-01-04T20:09:00.000Z	Matan_		heh
2012-01-04T20:09:00.000Z	Matan_		sounds like fun
2012-01-04T20:09:00.000Z	mneptok	Matan_	what is the issue you are having?
2012-01-04T20:10:00.000Z	Matan_	mneptok	I'm at the Installation Type page, and it seems like any partition I choose, it just says "no root file system is defined"
2012-01-04T20:10:00.000Z	mneptok	Matan_	did you create empty disk space for the Linux partitions?
2012-01-04T20:11:00.000Z	Matan_	mneptok	Yes, I have a partition for Windows and an empty partition for Ubuntu
2012-01-04T20:11:00.000Z	Matan_	mneptok	however, for the Ubuntu partition is says on the type column, nothing, and the "used" column is unknown
2012-01-04T20:12:00.000Z	mneptok	Matan_	do back to Win. delete that empty partition. just leave it as blank, unallocated space. let the Ubuntu installer create and format partitions in that space/
2012-01-04T20:12:00.000Z	mneptok	Matan_	s/do back/go back/
2012-01-04T20:12:00.000Z	Matan_	mneptok	Is it allocated space right now? It seems like unallocted..
2012-01-04T20:13:00.000Z	mneptok	Matan_	you'll have to tell the Ubuntu installer where to find the partitions to install to, and format them accordingly.
2012-01-04T20:14:00.000Z	Matan_	mneptok	allright, I'm switching back to Windows, let's see how it works
2012-01-04T20:18:00.000Z	Matan_	mneptok	do you mean to completely delete the extra partition?
2012-01-04T20:21:00.000Z	mneptok	Matan_	yes. let Ubuntu create the partitions it will use.
2012-01-04T20:21:00.000Z	mneptok	Matan_	empty, unpartitioned, unformatted space is going to be the least confusing to the installer.
