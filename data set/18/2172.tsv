2012-03-08T02:28:00.000Z	grzesag		 HI, I need help with openload - to run it in cron e.g. ever 5 minutes and save results into file. Please help
2012-03-08T02:29:00.000Z	grzesag		 I have this entry in crontab: */5 * * * * openload -l 5 www.example.com >> /home/user/results.txt
2012-03-08T02:30:00.000Z	sacarlson	grzesag	*/5 * * * * openload >openload.log
2012-03-08T02:31:00.000Z	sacarlson	grzesag	looks good to me other than maybe openload requires sudo?
2012-03-08T02:35:00.000Z	sacarlson	grzesag	might try */5 * * * * sudo openload -l 5 www.example.com >> /home/user/results.txt
2012-03-08T02:36:00.000Z	grzesag	sacarlson	 I will try
2012-03-08T02:36:00.000Z	sacarlson	grzesag	oh but that would also require that your sudo user not require a password so maybe just do it in root cron with sudo crontab -e
2012-03-08T02:37:00.000Z	grzesag	sacarlson	ok
2012-03-08T02:42:00.000Z	sacarlson	grzesag	oh maybe it's like running top in cron,  I don't think you could as it's changing and moving the curser
2012-03-08T02:44:00.000Z	sacarlson	grzesag	I don't know what the output of openload looks like so that's my best guess if the data seen on the screen changes but stays in the same place
2012-03-08T02:45:00.000Z	grzesag	sacarlson	please see this: http://pastebin.com/yEmBKqPG
2012-03-08T02:45:00.000Z	sacarlson	grzesag	that's static but do those numbers change like when you run top?
2012-03-08T02:47:00.000Z	grzesag	sacarlson	similar to ping
2012-03-08T02:47:00.000Z	grzesag	sacarlson	whan I change openload into ping it saves just fine
2012-03-08T02:48:00.000Z	grzesag	sacarlson	I habe been trying to sort it for the last 3 days
2012-03-08T02:48:00.000Z	grzesag	sacarlson	any idea pleas help
2012-03-08T02:48:00.000Z	sacarlson	grzesag	then maybe it's not a cursers problem? nope I'm out of ideas
2012-03-08T02:49:00.000Z	grzesag	sacarlson	thank you for your time
