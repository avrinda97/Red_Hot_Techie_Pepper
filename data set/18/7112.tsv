2008-02-05T03:44:00.000Z	Jordan_U	cafaro	No
2008-02-05T03:46:00.000Z	Jordan_U	cafaro	No
2008-02-05T03:47:00.000Z	Jordan_U	cafaro	I would reccommend downloading FF2 separately and waiting until Hardy is released to upgrade directly to it
2008-02-05T03:47:00.000Z	Jordan_U	cafaro	I can walk you through installing FF2 in dapper
2008-02-05T03:49:00.000Z	Jordan_U	cafaro	the easiest ( and least invasive ) thing to do to install Firefox 2 is to first download the tar.gz from mozilla's site ( I'm getting the link now... )
2008-02-05T03:49:00.000Z	Jordan_U	cafaro	This should be it : http://download.mozilla.org/?product=firefox-2.0.0.11&os=linux&lang=en-US
2008-02-05T03:50:00.000Z	Jordan_U	cafaro	It will be for the next version of Ubuntu
2008-02-05T03:50:00.000Z	Jordan_U	cafaro	That is why I suggest waiting
2008-02-05T03:50:00.000Z	Jordan_U	cafaro	Have you finished downloading it yet?
2008-02-05T03:51:00.000Z	Jordan_U	cafaro	Ok, now you can just drag the script named "firefox" to your top panel and you should be able to start it from there
2008-02-05T03:52:00.000Z	Jordan_U	cafaro	( This is how I have FF3 Beta installed on my machine )
2008-02-05T03:54:00.000Z	Jordan_U	cafaro	Yes
2008-02-05T03:55:00.000Z	cafaro	Jordan_U	when i click on the script, my old FF starts again..
2008-02-05T03:56:00.000Z	Jordan_U	cafaro	Try closing your old firefox first ( it tries to detect if FF is already open )
2008-02-05T03:57:00.000Z	Jordan_U	cafaro	np, when 8.04 is released you should be able to upgrade to it directly and simply remove the firefox directory to uninstall it
2008-02-05T03:58:00.000Z	Jordan_U	cafaro	And again, if you want to create a shortcut to FF2 you can drag the "firefox" script into your gnome-panel
