2006-11-25T15:22:00.000Z	Imsdle		it is my old fedore core drive and i can't find /home/ anywhere
2006-11-25T15:23:00.000Z	dabaR	Imsdle	the home was a different partition?
2006-11-25T15:23:00.000Z	dabaR	Imsdle	try sudo fdisk -l and see whether you see some other partitions on the same drive, or something.
2006-11-25T15:27:00.000Z	dabaR	Imsdle	you can mount them, as soon as you know about them, did you run the fdisk command?
2006-11-25T15:29:00.000Z	dabaR	Imsdle	why not?
2006-11-25T15:30:00.000Z	dabaR	Imsdle	run mount|grep hdb2 in a terminal
2006-11-25T15:31:00.000Z	dabaR	Imsdle	it shows what exactly?
2006-11-25T15:32:00.000Z	dabaR	Imsdle	what command do you use to mount? show me the output of sudo fdisk -l on a pastebin too.
2006-11-25T15:34:00.000Z	dabaR	Imsdle	ls /media/mels_backups, does it show any files?
2006-11-25T15:36:00.000Z	dabaR	Imsdle	I am gonna look for a linux lvm file system.
