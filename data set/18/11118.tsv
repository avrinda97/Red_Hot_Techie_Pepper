2008-01-30T19:38:00.000Z	donald_	new2linux	ubuntu 7.10 installed?
2008-01-30T19:43:00.000Z	donald_	new2linux	why would it say your name before u type?
2008-01-30T19:50:00.000Z	donald_	new2linux	strange.  u say it was an Atheros and plugged into PCMCIA?
2008-01-30T20:04:00.000Z	donald_	new2linux	is gone?
2008-01-30T20:52:00.000Z	donald_	new2linux	why would u want to fix that?
2008-01-30T20:53:00.000Z	donald_	new2linux	why would u want to edit that?
2008-01-30T20:56:00.000Z	donald_	new2linux	u are in Xubuntu. gedit is not installed
2008-01-30T21:06:00.000Z	donald_	new2linux	Control O saves the file Control X quits
2008-01-30T21:15:00.000Z	donald_	new2linux	u should look at pastebin
2008-01-30T21:19:00.000Z	donald_	new2linux	the output of "tail -f /var/log/messages" as you insert the PCMCIA card
2008-01-30T21:26:00.000Z	donald_	new2linux	looks like u may have to undo the changes to /etc/pcmcia/config.opts
2008-01-30T21:28:00.000Z	donald_	new2linux	ok. copy the text that is added on the screen as the card is inserted. then use pastebin to show them to us
2008-01-30T21:33:00.000Z	donald_	new2linux	just the text that changed/added on as the card is plugged in
