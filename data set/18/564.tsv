2011-12-20T22:45:00.000Z	Mikeyn		I guess nobody could help me :(
2011-12-20T22:47:00.000Z	XamDM	Mikeyn	isn't ther an older kernel installed so that you can usethat one (old linux entry in grub) ???
2011-12-20T22:48:00.000Z	Mikeyn		xam im not sure
2011-12-20T22:48:00.000Z	Mikeyn		how would I go about checking that on a white macbook?
2011-12-20T22:49:00.000Z	XamDM	Mikeyn	i dont have a mac. but grub should show you a list of available systems (kernels etc)
2011-12-20T22:49:00.000Z	Mikeyn		I know the updates recently updated the kernel, which could have caused this, does it usually back up the older kernel that worked?? and if so how do I access it
2011-12-20T22:49:00.000Z	Mikeyn		when I hold down option, it brings me to a window that shows a partition named "windows" and ive never had windows on there
2011-12-20T22:49:00.000Z	Mikeyn		and when i select it it boots normally and i get the same error
2011-12-20T22:50:00.000Z	XamDM	Mikeyn	is OSX installed and bootable ???
2011-12-20T22:50:00.000Z	Mikeyn		I replaced os x with ubuntu because i didn't plan on using it ever again
2011-12-20T22:51:00.000Z	XamDM	Mikeyn	so if there is no option to lauch the older kernel i don't have any idea to boot up the system without livecd
2011-12-20T22:51:00.000Z	Mikeyn		I'm not a big fan of OS X, but it does run on intel based systems now
2011-12-20T22:52:00.000Z	XamDM	Mikeyn	maybe you can find a Linux Livecd in a shop ???
2011-12-20T22:52:00.000Z	Mikeyn	XamDM	what would the grub menu look like?
2011-12-20T22:52:00.000Z	XamDM	Mikeyn	im on 11.10 and it shows an entry wwith old linux
2011-12-20T22:53:00.000Z	XamDM	Mikeyn	but on Macbook its the efi-version of grub, i don't know anything about it ...
2011-12-20T22:57:00.000Z	Mikeyn		how do you guys normally boot into grub, holding down the esc key?
2011-12-20T22:57:00.000Z	XamDM	Mikeyn	on non efi-systems it is shown on boot
