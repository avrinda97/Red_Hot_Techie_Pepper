2006-09-19T06:55:00.000Z	Sembiance		Hi Ubuntu peopls!
2006-09-19T06:55:00.000Z	Sembiance		err peoples rofl
2006-09-19T06:56:00.000Z	Sembiance		I'm a developer, and I've been using Linux for years, but always as a server. I'm ready now to change my workstation to a Linux machine now and will be doing things like writing code, listening to music, watching videos, etc. I've tried Gentoo in the past but I hate how long it takes to compile things and how you have to work so hard to get your hardware to work.
2006-09-19T06:57:00.000Z	Sembiance		So I'm looking at ubuntu to ease the 'make my hardware work' pain
2006-09-19T06:57:00.000Z	Sembiance		However I'm worried that ubuntu might be too easy? By that I mean, will I be able to download the latest source code for things like PHP and what not and isntall them?
2006-09-19T06:57:00.000Z	krazykit	Sembiance	you must've done something wrong if you had problems getting your hardware working in gentoo.  it's simply a matter of know what you have.  ubuntu makes it easy by having all the modules compiled and ready for you
2006-09-19T06:58:00.000Z	krazykit	Sembiance	they don't.  you can make deb packages yourself
2006-09-19T06:58:00.000Z	Sembiance	krazykit	I never had 'problems' per se, as lspci -v always works well and then just compile a kernel. but it's always a big pain and takes time
2006-09-19T06:58:00.000Z	krazykit	Sembiance	meh, only the first time :-p
2006-09-19T06:59:00.000Z	Sembiance	krazykit	chuckyp, Deaigo: Thank you very much for your help and answering my questions :)
2006-09-19T07:00:00.000Z	krazykit	Sembiance	ubuntu's build environment is easy enough to set up.  i compile things now and again and have never had problems
2006-09-19T07:02:00.000Z	Sembiance	krazykit	That's good to know
2006-09-19T07:11:00.000Z	krazykit	Sembiance	Ubuntu is Gnome, Kubuntu is KDE, and Xubuntu is xfce.
2006-09-19T07:11:00.000Z	krazykit	Sembiance	though i'm a fan of xubuntu + e17 >_>
2006-09-19T07:17:00.000Z	krazykit	Sembiance	compiz?  feh.  it gets lame after an hour or so, imo
2006-09-19T07:17:00.000Z	Sembiance	krazykit	That's what I figured. Whenever I need to work in windows the first thing I do is turn off all themes and animations
2006-09-19T07:30:00.000Z	krazykit	Sembiance	not really a mistake, it'll just install gnome first.
2006-09-19T07:31:00.000Z	krazykit	Sembiance	yeah, synaptic... but imo aptitude is better
