2011-09-10T15:43:00.000Z	nobitanobi		Hello.  I just installed some updates on my 11.04, and the @ every web that has flash it says "flash is not installed".  I tried removing it from Ubuntu software center and installing it again, and it keeps saying taht I don't have flash.  Any thoughts?
2011-09-10T15:44:00.000Z	max_	nobitanobi	> install flash plugin
2011-09-10T15:45:00.000Z	nobitanobi		I have done that max_
2011-09-10T15:45:00.000Z	nobitanobi		I can see it checked in the repo
2011-09-10T15:46:00.000Z	max_	nobitanobi	> from which source do u install it?
