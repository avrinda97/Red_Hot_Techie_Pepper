2008-09-21T03:58:00.000Z	csilk		why does ubuntu always get the time wrong when you install it?
2008-09-21T03:58:00.000Z	csilk		it always gets it wrong by an hour
2008-09-21T03:58:00.000Z	D3RGPS31	csilk	it's the ubuntu way!
2008-10-26T05:44:00.000Z	csilk	D3RGPS31	 so how did you manage to write to it from windows then?
2008-10-26T05:45:00.000Z	D3RGPS31	csilk	i just did; _2 there's not way to get them from linux?
2008-10-26T05:46:00.000Z	csilk	D3RGPS31	I'm just really curious, if windows can't see your swap partition how did you write file to it from windows?
2008-10-26T05:46:00.000Z	csilk	D3RGPS31	and no, I'm pretty sure you can access the swap partition in the manner you would like to from linux (or any OS as far as I am aware) -_-
2008-10-26T05:48:00.000Z	D3RGPS31	csilk	_2 I used a windows program that allowed me to read and write ext2/3 & swap, I'd tell the name but it's in the swap partition
2008-10-26T05:49:00.000Z	csilk	D3RGPS31	oh rite, although I've never heard of that happening it makes a little more sense now, I can only suggest you go back to windows and use the same application to get the files out
2008-10-26T05:50:00.000Z	csilk	D3RGPS31	yeah _2  has a point, if it is mounted as swap then linux will of probably trashed whatever was on there
2008-10-26T05:58:00.000Z	D3RGPS31	csilk	_2, you know where I can ask?
2008-10-26T05:58:00.000Z	csilk	D3RGPS31	i already told what to do
2008-10-26T05:58:00.000Z	D3RGPS31	csilk	I have no windows computers around
2008-10-26T05:59:00.000Z	csilk	D3RGPS31	are you sure swap isnt mounted right now?
2008-10-26T05:59:00.000Z	D3RGPS31	csilk	yes
2008-10-26T05:59:00.000Z	csilk	D3RGPS31	how did you stop it from mounting?
2008-10-26T05:00:00.000Z	D3RGPS31	csilk	it's from an external harddrive
2008-10-26T05:01:00.000Z	D3RGPS31	csilk	all files that were placed in it over time have never been erased, even from switching it from windows to linux
