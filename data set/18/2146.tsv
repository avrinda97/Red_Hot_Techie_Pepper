2010-08-07T08:52:00.000Z	bowei006		does ubutnu server have an actual interface? after i logged in all i see is this terminal stuff. is there an interface or do i do everything from there?
2010-08-07T08:53:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	bowei006	no, the server by default has only a command line interface, use the desktop edition if you want a graphical desktop
2010-08-07T08:53:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	bowei006	you can install server software on the desktop edition too, or any other kind of software
2010-08-07T08:55:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	bowei006	you mean "gnome desktop" well yes but you're better off using the desktop edition
2010-08-07T09:04:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	bowei006	to host a site to be exposed on the internet? you need a web server for that not an ftp server
2010-08-07T09:04:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	bowei006	there are some very simple to use web servers like lighttpd
2010-08-07T09:04:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	bowei006	what are you reading from? link
2010-08-07T09:09:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	bowei006	it mentions ftp as just one supported way to get your files to a web server, you need to either a) buy a web hosting + domain name package and it will provide you with username and password to upload your files or b) set up your own web server + dns  (using lighttpd for example) and buy a domain to point to it
2010-08-07T09:09:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	bowei006	but since you're new to all this, i suggest just buying a cheap hosting + domain package
2010-08-07T09:10:00.000Z	bowei006	ilovefairuz	 i have a domain from dyndns does that count. and im not really too much a noobie. i got this working locally and i just dont get ubutnu
2010-08-07T09:11:00.000Z	bowei006	ilovefairuz	does lighttpd support mac osx?
2010-08-07T09:11:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	bowei006	yeah dyndns could work but you'll still have to set up a webserver
2010-08-07T09:11:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	bowei006	lighttpd will be installed on the ubuntu machine not the mac, it will be accessible using any browser just like any web page
2010-08-07T09:12:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	bowei006	but yes lighttpd can be installed on mac too
2010-08-07T09:12:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	bowei006	lighttpd is easier, faster and more secure
2010-08-07T09:13:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	bowei006	use apache only if you need a specific feature that it has but i doubt you'd need anything like that
2010-08-07T09:13:00.000Z	bowei006	ilovefairuz	thank you. i will go and do some reasearch and do some testing now. sorry for bothering you guys
2010-08-07T09:13:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	bowei006	you're welcome and don't worry, if you have questions come and ask
