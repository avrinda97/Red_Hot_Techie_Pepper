2005-01-30T06:42:00.000Z	arabflak		I've been through Suse, Debian and Gentoo.
2005-01-30T06:42:00.000Z	arabflak		Only Suse worked.
2005-01-30T06:43:00.000Z	arabflak		Now I'm in Ubuntu :)
2005-01-30T06:43:00.000Z	arabflak		Yay :)
2005-01-30T06:43:00.000Z	arabflak		Yeah, knghtbrd, but I can't seem to install the drivers.
2005-01-30T06:44:00.000Z	arabflak		I've activated my root account, killed GDM, sh'd the .run from Nvidia, it said it couldn't match my kernel and if I wanted to try and find better ones at download.nvidia.com.
2005-01-30T06:44:00.000Z	arabflak		It couldn't find any, so if I wanted to compile right ones.
2005-01-30T06:44:00.000Z	arabflak		I couldn't because I didn't have a CC compiler.
2005-01-30T06:44:00.000Z	arabflak		And how do I get those? (install those :P)

2005-01-30T06:45:00.000Z	scizzo	arabflak	there is a small howto there about the drivers....but maybe daniels link is better... :P
2005-01-30T06:53:00.000Z	scizzo	arabflak	it should have a pass
2005-01-30T06:54:00.000Z	scizzo	arabflak	it should be the password you set for the first user you create on the system
2005-01-30T06:57:00.000Z	scizzo	arabflak	try sudo -s -H then
2005-01-30T06:58:00.000Z	arabflak	scizzo	I already activated my root account with an alternate password.
2005-01-30T06:59:00.000Z	scizzo	arabflak	I just want you to try it
2005-01-30T06:59:00.000Z	scizzo	arabflak	I also made root a password...but..after reinstalling and reading about sudo a little more...I found out that setting a password for root was evil
