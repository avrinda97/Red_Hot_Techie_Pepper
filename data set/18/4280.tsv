2009-06-09T20:48:00.000Z	ozzer		so can anyone help me or not?
2009-06-09T20:49:00.000Z	ozzer		I have a really weird problem with anything that plays audio content (rythmbox, youtube). It plays normally sometimes but occasionally just speeds up to about 3x normal speed. I have just today done a clean install of ubuntu and reinstalled flash player and the problem is still there.
2009-06-09T20:49:00.000Z	gartral	ozzer	have you tryed using OSS instead?
2009-06-09T20:50:00.000Z	ozzer	gartral	what's that and how do i get it
2009-06-09T20:50:00.000Z	gartral	ozzer	it's a different sound system, i find that pulse isn't realtime, and oss works better, you may have different experiences
2009-06-09T20:51:00.000Z	gartral	ozzer	you can get it by doing sudo apt-get install oss
2009-06-09T20:52:00.000Z	ozzer	gartral	okay i'll try that
2009-06-09T20:53:00.000Z	ozzer	gartral	Couldn't find package oss :P
2009-06-09T20:55:00.000Z	ozzer	gartral	went into sound preferences and changed everything to oss, gonna try see if that works
2009-06-09T20:55:00.000Z	gartral	ozzer	asoundconfig set-oss
2009-06-09T20:56:00.000Z	ozzer	gartral	asoundconfig command not found
2009-06-09T20:57:00.000Z	gartral	ozzer	odd
2009-06-09T21:02:00.000Z	gartral	ozzer	everything ok now?
2009-06-09T21:03:00.000Z	ozzer	gartral	better, still speeding up for the odd second but slows down again fairly quickly. not unusable any more
2009-06-09T21:04:00.000Z	gartral	ozzer	join the reest of the people who think pulse is completly borked in Ubuntu! :)
2009-06-09T21:05:00.000Z	ozzer	gartral	what's the difference between them?
2009-06-09T21:05:00.000Z	ozzer	gartral	and why isn't the one that works default?
2009-06-09T21:06:00.000Z	gartral	ozzer	pulse is more extensable... but oss is know to be a bit more stable... oss is also legally restricted somehow... so it doesnt ship with Ubuntu OTB
