2008-05-30T04:06:00.000Z	HackOfChris	tj83	I need to install vista first then install ubuntu?
2008-05-30T04:11:00.000Z	HackOfChris	tj83	I probably could, but the teachers require the code and source files to all projects.  They compile it themselves to check us.  It sucks
2008-05-30T04:12:00.000Z	HackOfChris	tj83	so i'm kinda stuck to using there software alone
2008-05-30T04:13:00.000Z	HackOfChris	tj83	the only reason I was considering dual booting
2008-05-30T04:37:00.000Z	HackOfChris	tj83	ok kewl, if i dual vista, 20g wont work will it?
2008-05-30T04:40:00.000Z	HackOfChris	tj83	so 50g(vista)/20(ubuntu)/2(swap)/31(shared)  sound good?
2008-05-30T04:43:00.000Z	HackOfChris	tj83	so 40 for ubuntu,  is 20 enough for ubuntu or should i go a little bigger
