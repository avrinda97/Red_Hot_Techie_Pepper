2005-11-17T17:15:00.000Z	dylan_		DapperDrake, is the GNOME team working to reduce processor and RAM memory requirements?
2005-11-17T17:15:00.000Z	Blissex	dylan_	yes, but dream on
2005-11-17T17:15:00.000Z	dylan_	Blissex	is KDE better?  Ive never used it
2005-11-17T17:15:00.000Z	Blissex	dylan_	it is slightly less memory hungry...
2005-11-17T17:16:00.000Z	dylan_	Blissex	why did you tell me to 'dream on' ?
2005-11-17T17:17:00.000Z	Blissex	dylan_	as to dreaming, link to follow...
2005-11-17T17:18:00.000Z	dylan_	Blissex	i dont understand
2005-11-17T17:18:00.000Z	Blissex	dylan_	http://www.sabi.co.uk/Notes/anno05-2nd.html#050512
2005-11-17T17:20:00.000Z	dylan_	Blissex	so what window manager is both highly usable like gnome or kde and not memory hungry
2005-11-17T17:20:00.000Z	Blissex	dylan_	XFCE4 for example, and there is now Xubuntu, a project to use it. Also, it is possible to configure KDE to be a lot less memory hungry.
2005-11-17T17:21:00.000Z	dylan_	Blissex	but you cannot configure gnome to be less memory hungry?
2005-11-17T17:22:00.000Z	Blissex	dylan_	a bit less, but not quite as much as KDE. GNOME developers are usually wealthy people with large amounts of RAM.
2005-11-17T17:22:00.000Z	Blissex	dylan_	for KDE, have a look here: http://WWW.sabi.co.UK/Notes/linuxKDE.html#performance for memory reduction options.
2005-11-17T17:22:00.000Z	dylan_	Blissex	kde is quite flashy....why such?
2005-11-17T17:23:00.000Z	Blissex	dylan_	also read this for minimizing memory usage at the kernel level: http://www.sabi.co.uk/Notes/anno05-4th.html#051008
2005-11-17T17:23:00.000Z	Blissex	dylan_	KDE is quite flashy by default, to impress people, just like GNOME. The ''demo effect''.
2005-11-17T17:23:00.000Z	dylan_	Blissex	i thought flashy and high-graphics UIs were memory hungry
2005-11-17T17:24:00.000Z	Blissex	dylan_	yes, thats why one should disable all flashy effects in KDE, as the page I linked to says.
