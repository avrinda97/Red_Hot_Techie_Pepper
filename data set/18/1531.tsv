2012-09-13T14:36:00.000Z	esing	dr_willis	How would I do that?
2012-09-13T17:45:00.000Z	dr_willis	esing	i edit the config in /etc/grub/  to use whatever file i want.
2012-09-13T17:45:00.000Z	dr_willis	esing	it used to have a image setting or lines in there.
2012-09-13T17:46:00.000Z	esing	dr_willis	I read that config but it is build with if loops, like if it does not find that image it will use in the end the standard ubuntu desktop wallpaper. so I would not know where to insert the filepath for my wallpaper..
2012-09-13T17:46:00.000Z	dr_willis	esing	 i change the code. or copy my image to wheres it is looking
