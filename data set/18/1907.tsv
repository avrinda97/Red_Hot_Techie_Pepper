2010-10-11T08:40:00.000Z	rifter	Phrosty1	and no you do not want /boot on a ntfs partition it has to be a linux filesystem.  but it will be in / like they said
2010-10-11T08:40:00.000Z	rifter	Phrosty1	okey
2010-10-11T09:01:00.000Z	rifter	Phrosty1	yes there are
2010-10-11T09:02:00.000Z	rifter	Phrosty1	but if you open details or whatever it should show what it is doing .. hmm actually if I rememebr right there is a little black area below the progress bar showing commands
2010-10-11T09:03:00.000Z	Phrosty1	rifter	i'm installing.. not updating
2010-10-11T09:03:00.000Z	rifter	Phrosty1	well it's been in beta awhile and the release candidate actually came out awhile back so versions were probably frozen at that point
2010-10-11T09:03:00.000Z	rifter	Phrosty1	right but there is a setting  to install updates during the install
2010-10-11T09:03:00.000Z	rifter	Phrosty1	that is what I did today
2010-10-11T09:04:00.000Z	rifter	Phrosty1	well there is a box below the progress bar that tells you what it is doing
2010-10-11T09:04:00.000Z	rifter	Phrosty1	the actual console output form the commands
2010-10-11T09:06:00.000Z	rifter	Phrosty1	then that is what it is doing
