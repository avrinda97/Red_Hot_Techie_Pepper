2006-12-17T14:59:00.000Z	Edulix		anyone installed opera 9.10 in ubuntu?
2006-12-17T15:00:00.000Z	Edulix		the pakage is probably thought for debian and it wants me to install  libqt3c102-mt
2006-12-17T15:00:00.000Z	un_operateur1	Edulix	you can download the .deb from opera's repo and install it manually
2006-12-17T15:00:00.000Z	Edulix		so that it doesn't complain
2006-12-17T15:01:00.000Z	Edulix	un_operateur1	I'm sure. that's exactly what I did
2006-12-17T15:01:00.000Z	Edulix		xD
2006-12-17T15:01:00.000Z	Edulix	un_operateur1	the ubuntu package is still the old one
