2006-04-19T05:46:00.000Z	Concord_Dawn	suspect_	it's because you haven't set up an association for .exe files.
2006-04-19T05:46:00.000Z	Concord_Dawn	suspect_	you don't.
2006-04-19T05:49:00.000Z	Concord_Dawn	suspect_	you need to put quotes around /home/suspect...........
2006-04-19T05:51:00.000Z	Concord_Dawn	suspect_	please paste the errors?
2006-04-19T05:52:00.000Z	Concord_Dawn	suspect_	find codmp.exe and tell me what the pathname is.
2006-04-19T05:57:00.000Z	Concord_Dawn	suspect_	you fail at Linux. Please reformat and go back to Windows. If you can't figure out how to run a program from terminal, you don't deserve to run Linux.
2006-04-19T05:59:00.000Z	Concord_Dawn	suspect_	you need to read the "Linux for Dummies" book before you start using Linux.
