2009-05-25T12:30:00.000Z	Aryaan		hi, can somehelp me with this login trouble. I keep coming back to the login screen.
2009-05-25T12:30:00.000Z	Aryaan		but gconf is just about Gnome right? I cant get into into KDE either, flintwingel .
2009-05-25T12:31:00.000Z	arbiter26	Aryaan	It could be some startup program that doesn't want to load
2009-05-25T12:32:00.000Z	arbiter26	Aryaan	What he said!
2009-05-25T12:36:00.000Z	arbiter26	Aryaan	cp -r YOURHOME TMPHOME; rm -r YOURHOME; mkdir YOURHOME
2009-05-25T12:37:00.000Z	arbiter26	Aryaan	With sudo, but I think that mv won't work for directories without a flag of some kind...
2009-05-25T12:43:00.000Z	arbiter26	Aryaan	Yeah
2009-05-25T12:44:00.000Z	arbiter26	Aryaan	I'm not sure what it was
2009-05-25T12:45:00.000Z	arbiter26	Aryaan	You could always just make an extra user to log into when you're having problems
2009-05-25T12:58:00.000Z	Aryaan	arbiter26	flintwingel : login trouble is back. do you know any other solution
