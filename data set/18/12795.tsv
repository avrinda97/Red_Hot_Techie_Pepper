2008-09-01T09:05:00.000Z	banana-phana		Does anyone know how to play music files over a network in Rhythmbox?
2008-09-01T09:05:00.000Z	banana-phana		It can see them, but won't play them.
2008-09-01T09:06:00.000Z	banana-phana		yup
2008-09-01T09:07:00.000Z	banana-phana		I tried the DAAP thing, but it just says "retrieving" forever

2008-09-01T09:07:00.000Z	banana-phana		Is there any patches for Rhythmbox for this?
2008-09-01T09:07:00.000Z	dr_Willis	banana-phana	 over a samba share?  You could mount the share locally with some tools. then it whould appear as a local directory
2008-09-01T09:08:00.000Z	dr_Willis	banana-phana	 useing the sshfs tool?
2008-09-01T09:09:00.000Z	dr_Willis	banana-phana	 'sshfs' works by mounting the ssh server to a local directory. that may work much better
2008-09-01T09:12:00.000Z	dr_Willis	banana-phana	 as far as i know the sshfs: stuff dosent mount the share...
2008-09-01T09:12:00.000Z	dr_Willis	banana-phana	 thats the BIG differaance . check the 'mount' command
2008-09-01T09:12:00.000Z	dr_Willis	banana-phana	 https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSHFS
2008-09-01T09:13:00.000Z	dr_Willis	banana-phana	 if it shows up in mount, you could point the program at the /home/user/whateversshismountedto/ and see the remote machine
2008-09-01T09:32:00.000Z	dr_Willis	banana-phana	 i think you just install the proper 'ubuntu-restricted-extras' or perhaps some others and it will play them
