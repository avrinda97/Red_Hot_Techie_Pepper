2008-06-28T00:02:00.000Z	unop	anirudh0	that does not enable or disable a service tho
2008-06-28T00:02:00.000Z	anirudh0	unop	if service is in init.d,then yes..else no
2008-06-28T00:03:00.000Z	unop	anirudh0	nope, you can stop a service that way, but when you change runlevels, it will be back up -- quite obviously because it is not disabled
2008-06-28T00:05:00.000Z	anirudh0	unop	ahh..yes
2008-07-20T00:27:00.000Z	anirudh0	unop	do a chown on the file
2008-07-20T00:27:00.000Z	unop	anirudh0	it's default2 with the issue -- and the file exists on cdrom
2008-07-20T00:28:00.000Z	anirudh0	unop	oh..sorry.
2008-07-20T00:28:00.000Z	unop	anirudh0	i guess you will have to copy the files on cdrom locally
2008-08-01T17:01:00.000Z	unop	anirudh0	sudo ?
2008-08-01T17:01:00.000Z	anirudh0	unop	yes
2008-08-01T17:02:00.000Z	unop	anirudh0	that's a silly use of sudo
2008-08-01T17:03:00.000Z	unop	anirudh0	and window managers are invoked by the user not root
2008-08-05T02:28:00.000Z	unop	anirudh0	quite obviously
2008-08-05T02:29:00.000Z	anirudh0	unop	then perhaps you should help blarg
2008-08-05T02:42:00.000Z	unop	anirudh0	how is it temporary?
2008-08-05T03:00:00.000Z	anirudh0	unop	type the path out in terminal first
2008-08-05T03:00:00.000Z	unop	anirudh0	redirect .. :)
