2008-05-03T04:27:00.000Z	earthsound		does anyone have any decent knowledge of GRUM?
2008-05-03T04:27:00.000Z	earthsound		*GRUB
2008-05-03T04:29:00.000Z	earthsound		normally, I have a master IDE HD with Winblows XP & a SATA HD with 4 partitions: 1st NTFS storage space, 2 ext3 & a swap partition
2008-05-03T04:30:00.000Z	earthsound		and it's set to boot hd(1,2) normally (my ubuntu installation)
2008-05-03T04:30:00.000Z	earthsound		but when I add an IDE HD to the slave portion of the IDE cable (BIOS detects all 3 drives) i cannot get to the GRUB menu :|
2008-05-03T04:31:00.000Z	earthsound		I can do this temporarily while the 2nd IDE HD is plugged in?
2008-05-03T04:32:00.000Z	earthsound		that could be it, as well. though I think my BIOS has a setting for SCSI-SATA boot order and it's set to SCSI (I believe)  which I assumed it was treating IDE as SCSI
2008-05-03T04:33:00.000Z	earthsound		i'm in ubuntu right now...when I unplug the 2nd IDE HD GRUB works just fine :|
2008-05-03T04:34:00.000Z	Scunizi	earthsound	change your boot order and let the drive that works be #1 in the boot process
2008-05-03T04:36:00.000Z	earthsound	Scunizi	the only problem is that I cannot get to the GRUB menu to press e to edit it and select the correct HD to boot from :(
2008-05-03T04:37:00.000Z	earthsound	Scunizi	ok, i'm going to come in here on another machine & reboot this one
2008-05-03T05:01:00.000Z	Scunizi	earthsound	try to pm me
2008-05-03T04:56:00.000Z	earthsound	Scunizi	ok, i'm in my BIOS, what should I be looking for?
2008-05-03T04:57:00.000Z	Scunizi	earthsound	remind me .. grub issue or cd rom.. been talking to a lot ob people.
2008-05-03T04:58:00.000Z	Scunizi	earthsound	and when you remove the master does it boot? or when you remove the primary slave HD it boots?
2008-05-03T05:00:00.000Z	Scunizi	earthsound	you just need to reinstall grub.. are you registered here on freenode?
2008-05-03T05:01:00.000Z	earthsound	Scunizi	removing the master HD results in "A disk read error occurred" Press Ctrl+Alt+Del to restart"
2008-05-03T05:02:00.000Z	Scunizi	earthsound	plug it back in and put the live cd in the machine and let it boot..
