2007-02-19T14:53:00.000Z	dyrne	rylan	maybe you could stdout every package installed and pipe it to dpkg-reconfigure ;)
2007-02-19T14:53:00.000Z	rylan	dyrne	could you repeat that in plain english?
2007-02-19T14:58:00.000Z	dyrne	rylan	english: sudo -s then do:    for i in $(grep Package /var/lib/dpkg/status| sed 's/Package: //g'); do dpkg-reconfigure $i;done im sure nothing bad would happen :)
2007-02-19T14:59:00.000Z	rylan	dyrne	i think you just confused me even more. could you just give me the command to copy into terminal?
2007-02-19T15:00:00.000Z	dyrne	rylan	im not sure id actually do that
2007-02-19T15:01:00.000Z	rylan	dyrne	oh.
2007-02-19T15:02:00.000Z	rylan	dyrne	so, what can i do then?
2007-02-19T15:04:00.000Z	dyrne	rylan	you can use 'sudo dpkg-reconfigure packagename' to get a default config for that app.  what application is it youre having a problem with? another option depending on problem is to delete the hiddent .conf file in your home dir when the app reloads youll get a new default one
2007-02-19T15:05:00.000Z	rylan	dyrne	thing is. its not just one thing. it seems like everything is being problematic
2007-02-19T15:06:00.000Z	rylan	dyrne	mostly my graphics card. i think my driver stopped working for some reason. and a lot of programs + my sound card = hate
2007-02-19T15:07:00.000Z	dyrne	rylan	the only thing i typically care about in my install is maybe a few files in /etc and then my /home directory. if  you reinstall go ahead and make a seperate partition for /home that way you can keep it as you upgrade and install new versions. you just point the installer to the existing partition and select home from dropdown
2007-02-19T15:07:00.000Z	dyrne	rylan	what version? dapper or edgy?
2007-02-19T15:07:00.000Z	rylan	dyrne	i had no idea what was going on in the install so i just let it have its way with my computer
2007-02-19T15:08:00.000Z	rylan	dyrne	im using edgy
2007-02-19T15:10:00.000Z	dyrne	rylan	you could try sudo dpkg-reconfigre alsa-utils   i think thats right. but whats the problem with sound?  graphics issues after upgrade you might need to sudo apt-get install linux-restricted-modules-$(uname -r); sudo apt-get reinstall nvidia-glx   or something
2007-02-19T15:11:00.000Z	rylan	dyrne	i think i will have to tackle that another night, right now i must tackle my girlfriend.
2007-02-19T15:11:00.000Z	rylan	dyrne	thanks for trying to help
2007-02-19T15:11:00.000Z	dyrne	rylan	good call.
