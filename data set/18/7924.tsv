2007-11-30T20:01:00.000Z	jurgentje		Hey... I've got a problem with Amarok. When trying to install the MP3-extensions (Adept Batch), it fails (not found or conflicting with other packets) ... is there a way for me to figure out where the conflict is?
2007-11-30T20:02:00.000Z	Profanephobia	jurgentje	are you trying to install the plugin using amarok?
2007-11-30T20:02:00.000Z	jurgentje	Profanephobia	yeps, I am
2007-11-30T20:03:00.000Z	Profanephobia	jurgentje	do you have the universe repos enabled?
2007-11-30T20:04:00.000Z	Profanephobia	jurgentje	if so do: sudo apt install gstreamer0.8-mad
2007-11-30T20:05:00.000Z	jurgentje	Profanephobia	(I'm running KDE btw... if it would be relevant) ...
2007-11-30T20:06:00.000Z	Profanephobia	jurgentje	ok... have you tried to install that package yet?
2007-11-30T20:07:00.000Z	jurgentje	Profanephobia	I'm trying to find (in KDE) what repo's are active...
2007-11-30T20:07:00.000Z	Profanephobia	jurgentje	ok
2007-11-30T20:08:00.000Z	Profanephobia	jurgentje	should still be in /etc/apt/sources.lst
2007-11-30T20:09:00.000Z	jurgentje	Profanephobia	as I thought... (I had it under Gnome) ... it's there...both universe and multiverse
2007-11-30T20:10:00.000Z	Profanephobia	jurgentje	ok then try doing sudo apt install gstreamer0.8-mad
2007-11-30T20:10:00.000Z	Profanephobia	jurgentje	then restart amarok
2007-11-30T20:11:00.000Z	jurgentje	Profanephobia	doing it as we're speaking...
2007-11-30T20:16:00.000Z	jurgentje	Profanephobia	done it... but on launch, Amarok still seems to download a bunch of other stuff, but I don't get to see what it all downloads... so I can't manually install all those :s
2007-11-30T20:16:00.000Z	jurgentje		still can't play my podcasts... :p
2007-11-30T20:16:00.000Z	jurgentje	Profanephobia	can I PM you (it's easier to talk)
2007-11-30T20:17:00.000Z	Profanephobia	jurgentje	thats fine
