2007-04-16T11:18:00.000Z	coz_		any work around for boot error     /bin/sh: can't access TTY; job control turned off
2007-04-16T11:19:00.000Z	sipior	coz_	that's a strange one. and google turned up nothing?
2007-04-16T11:20:00.000Z	coz_	sipior	thought i wuld check here first before googling
2009-05-28T20:25:00.000Z	sipior	coz_	jonaskoelker: the package repositories for warty have long been off-line.
2009-05-28T20:26:00.000Z	coz_	sipior	  I assumed that but no harm in trying :)
2009-09-28T18:55:00.000Z	sipior	coz_	probably why he was kicked :-)
2010-08-26T18:08:00.000Z	sipior	coz_	you get the console by logging in remotely, or via alt-f1?
2010-08-26T18:09:00.000Z	coz_	sipior	 well I have to use  ctrl+alt+F1  after the system freezes
2010-08-26T18:09:00.000Z	sipior	coz_	so the system doesn't actually freeze...
2010-08-26T18:10:00.000Z	coz_	sipior	 in the stricktest sense   no   but nothing including cursor input is available
2010-08-26T18:10:00.000Z	sipior	coz_	but keyboard input is. did you notice any other processes running whilst in console?
2010-08-26T18:11:00.000Z	coz_	sipior	 yes
2010-08-26T18:11:00.000Z	coz_	sipior	 but no applications are available
2010-08-26T18:11:00.000Z	sipior	coz_	sorry? which processes did you notice?
2010-08-26T18:11:00.000Z	coz_	sipior	 none
2010-08-26T18:12:00.000Z	sipior	coz_	so when you said "yes" just now...
2011-05-02T21:16:00.000Z	sipior	coz_	i wouldn't worry about it.
2011-05-03T21:21:00.000Z	sipior	coz_	rapeman is likely also a bot (the gnu/linux thing shows up fairly often here, with precisely the same formulation).
