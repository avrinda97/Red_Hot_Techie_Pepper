2005-11-07T11:12:00.000Z	Welly		Hello all.. i'm trying to set up an NFS share... have gone to system/administration/shared foldeers
2005-11-07T11:12:00.000Z	Welly		the drop down for "share with" only shows SMB not NFS
2005-11-07T11:13:00.000Z	Welly		any ideas what the problem is? on this machine, it prompted me to install NFS
2005-11-07T11:13:00.000Z	TuxToaster	Welly	you mount the shares as folders on your filesystem, though I myself am having problems getting the server to start sharing them in the first place
2005-11-07T11:14:00.000Z	Welly	TuxToaster	ah! oh ok.. :) good luck! i'll try that though

2005-11-07T11:15:00.000Z	TuxToaster		hmm.
2005-11-07T11:15:00.000Z	TuxToaster		!tell TuxToaster about nfs
2005-11-07T11:15:00.000Z	TuxToaster		worth a shot
2005-11-07T11:17:00.000Z	TuxToaster		why does ubotu give the wiki links in https?
2005-11-07T11:17:00.000Z	TuxToaster		lol
2005-11-07T11:17:00.000Z	TuxToaster		seems wierd to want an encrypted wiki to me :P
2005-11-07T11:18:00.000Z	TuxToaster		then again the one we have at work is encrypted but inaccessable outside of the local subnet
2005-11-07T11:18:00.000Z	TuxToaster		lol
2005-11-07T11:20:00.000Z	Welly	TuxToaster	I've right clicked on the folder, "share folder" and it only allows me to select SMB
