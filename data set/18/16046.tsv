2004-12-14T08:26:00.000Z	epotash		how can i install ubuntu on a laptop with no cdrom
2004-12-14T08:26:00.000Z	epotash		but floppy
2004-12-14T08:26:00.000Z	epotash		it is currently running debian woody
2004-12-14T08:27:00.000Z	farruinn	epotash	I wouldn't try this, but since Ubuntu is based on Debian perhaps it's possible to change the repository and do an "upgrade" - it's an intriguing idea
2004-12-24T15:31:00.000Z	farruinn	epotash	have you searched the Debian doc at all?
2004-12-24T15:35:00.000Z	farruinn	epotash	if you're talking about doing a netinstall of debian then upgrading to ubuntu?
2004-12-24T15:35:00.000Z	farruinn	epotash	if so that's exactly right
2004-12-24T15:36:00.000Z	farruinn	epotash	that's exactly what I was going to suggest =)
2004-12-24T15:39:00.000Z	farruinn	epotash	you might even do a woody net install, that way you're guaranteed that there's nothing in Debian that's newer in Ubuntu =)
2004-12-24T15:45:00.000Z	farruinn	epotash	there are many packages in sid that are at a higher version than they are in ubuntu
2004-12-24T15:46:00.000Z	farruinn	epotash	I like warty because it's frozen and stable
2004-12-24T15:48:00.000Z	epotash	farruinn	which version should i upgrade to?
2004-12-24T15:50:00.000Z	farruinn	epotash	warty is the stable, frozen branch, hoary is the unstable devel branch
2004-12-24T15:58:00.000Z	epotash	farruinn	do i only need to change that one thing in apt sources?
2004-12-24T15:59:00.000Z	farruinn	epotash	if you have deb-src lines change those too
2004-12-24T16:07:00.000Z	farruinn	epotash	this is only applicable to hoary, but they're working on 30 second boots
2004-12-25T06:02:00.000Z	farruinn	epotash	it's a meta-package, depends on tons of other packages
