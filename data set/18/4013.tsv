2009-06-15T03:44:00.000Z	luke_		(they are broken)
2009-06-15T03:44:00.000Z	brayden	luke_	you can't get visual effects when you do not have a working driver, your gonna have to remove your driver then install it
2009-06-15T03:45:00.000Z	luke_	brayden	do i do that in the synaptic package manager?
2009-06-15T03:46:00.000Z	brayden	luke_	you can do it through command line. what graphics driver version have you got and waht graphics card?
2009-06-15T03:47:00.000Z	luke_		i'm not sure what driver i have, (still a noob) but my card is a X3100 also called i965 i believe, its a macbook 4,1

2009-06-15T03:50:00.000Z	luke_	brayden	thanks man
2009-06-15T03:52:00.000Z	brayden	luke_	when searching your model number in the repos i found one package that apperaed to be a driver. it was xserver-xorg-video-intel
2009-06-15T03:52:00.000Z	luke_		is see that in my package manager brayden, should i uninstall then re install it, or is there more to it?
2009-06-15T03:54:00.000Z	brayden	luke_	to remove all the dependancies from a package you type into terminal e.g. sudo apt-get autoremove xserver-xorg-video-intel then you can just reinstall it with the apt-get install command. this of course requires reboot
2009-06-15T03:55:00.000Z	luke_	brayden	thanks alot! i'll try that right now
2009-06-15T03:55:00.000Z	brayden	luke_	good luck
