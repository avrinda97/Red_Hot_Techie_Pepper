2004-11-11T13:39:00.000Z	HWolf		Oh, fun. Mplayer has broken dependancies.
2004-11-11T13:41:00.000Z	HWolf		mplayer-386:
2004-11-11T13:41:00.000Z	HWolf		 Depends: libartsc0 but it is not going to be installed
2004-11-11T13:41:00.000Z	HWolf		 Depends: libggi2 but it is not going to be installed
2004-11-11T13:41:00.000Z	HWolf		  Depends: libungif4g but 4.1.0b1-6 is to be installed
2004-11-11T13:42:00.000Z	WW	HWolf	If you are trying to player DVDs, there are many alternatives to mplayer.  totem-xine, ogle, and vlc are all in universe.
2004-11-11T13:42:00.000Z	WW		s/player/play/
2004-11-11T13:43:00.000Z	HWolf	WW	if I try to install totem-xine, it wants to remove totem-gstreamer, and with it ubuntu-desktop
2004-11-11T13:44:00.000Z	HWolf		Hope, i'm still working on my tv-tuner, which doesn't give sound. :-S
2004-11-11T13:45:00.000Z	WW	HWolf	Right--totem-xine replaces totem-gstreamer.  And ubuntu-desktop is a meta-package.  Removing it shouldn't be a problem.
2004-11-11T13:45:00.000Z	WW	HWolf	If you don't want to do that, I can say that ogle works fine for me :)
2004-11-11T13:46:00.000Z	HWolf	WW	what exactly does ubuntu-desktop do?
2004-11-11T13:48:00.000Z	WW	HWolf	Someone else could probably explain this better, but here goes.  ubuntu-desktop is basically an "empty" package, but it depends on an assortment of "real" packages that ubuntu considers to be integral parts of the desktop.
2004-11-11T13:48:00.000Z	WW	HWolf	If you remove ubuntu-desktop, it will NOT remove all those dependencies.
2004-11-11T13:48:00.000Z	HWolf		I noticed. :-)
2004-11-11T13:49:00.000Z	HWolf		Just a warning, touch this and you touch ubuntu's core. :-)
2004-11-11T13:50:00.000Z	HWolf		Does this mean I can remove all those gstreamer packages?
2004-11-11T13:50:00.000Z	WW	HWolf	I'm not sure, but I don't think so.  For example, I think gstream0.8-mad is needed by apps that want to read mp3s.
