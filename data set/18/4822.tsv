2009-02-03T09:24:00.000Z	ninom		ubuntu starts and as soon as it loads the screen is black
2009-02-03T09:24:00.000Z	ninom		and it has this message not compatible with 75 hz only 60hz
2009-02-03T09:25:00.000Z	ninom		i press escape but than what
2009-02-03T09:25:00.000Z	ninom		it has 4 options
2009-02-03T09:25:00.000Z	ninom		like recovery and stuff
2009-02-03T09:26:00.000Z	ninom		i will just reinstall it this is a joke that i cant acces because of this little graphics problem
2009-02-03T09:27:00.000Z	ninom		droopsta915 i did that, but i also checked where it says sign in automaticly
2009-02-03T09:27:00.000Z	ninom		so it never shows  login name screen
2009-02-03T09:27:00.000Z	ninom		someone just needs to tell me is there safe mode for ubuntu and if there is how to access it before it loads
2009-02-03T09:28:00.000Z	ninom		or if someone has a site with step by step instructions
2009-02-03T09:28:00.000Z	therealnanotube	ninom	what do you need a "safe mode" for? i.e., what do you expect to get out of it?
2009-02-03T09:30:00.000Z	ninom	therealnanotube	well i am thinking windows, so i am hoping i can access safe mode so i can change my appearance settings from 75hz to 60hz so my monitor can work
2009-02-03T09:31:00.000Z	therealnanotube	ninom	ah... you need to switch to a virtual console, and edit your xorg.conf, then...
2009-02-03T09:36:00.000Z	therealnanotube	ninom	/after/ ubuntu loads, can you press "ctl-alt-f2", does that switch you to a text-only console?
2009-02-03T09:38:00.000Z	ninom	therealnanotube	i will try that right now.
2009-02-03T09:39:00.000Z	therealnanotube	ninom	ok, let me know what happens.
2009-02-03T09:44:00.000Z	ninom	therealnanotube	i va connected my desktop to my LCD screen and now there is no error like on my monitor. i am gonna change the settings now. thanks for listening to me and trying to help i areally appreciate it. thanks a lot.
2009-02-03T09:47:00.000Z	therealnanotube	ninom	ok, good luck, glad you figured it out :)
