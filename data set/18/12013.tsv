2006-10-28T12:59:00.000Z	Pelo		anyone have the link for flash 9 for linux ?
2006-10-28T13:00:00.000Z	variant	Pelo	it is extremely unstable at the momment, best avoided unless you cant avoid it..
2006-10-28T13:00:00.000Z	Pelo	variant	 I was using it in dapper,   It was ok for my purpose ,  do you have the link ?
2006-10-28T13:00:00.000Z	variant	Pelo	sorry no] 
2007-02-13T07:26:00.000Z	variant	Pelo	mplayer.. or google for m4a2mp3
2007-02-13T07:27:00.000Z	variant	Pelo	mplayer/mencoder
2007-02-13T07:27:00.000Z	variant	Pelo	well, mencoder which is part of mplayer. yes
2007-02-13T07:28:00.000Z	variant	Pelo	really you would want to play the m4a file and pipe it to mp3 encoder
2007-03-24T15:15:00.000Z	Pelo	variant	xtknight  thanks for that bit of info my borther has a 64 bit computer and I was thinking of installing ubu on it,  I'll read up first
2007-04-30T08:55:00.000Z	variant	Pelo	type /lastlog variant or /lastlog pricechild :) (depending on irc client)
2007-04-30T08:56:00.000Z	Pelo	variant	 thank you
2007-05-15T08:46:00.000Z	variant	Pelo	a script
2007-05-15T08:46:00.000Z	variant	Pelo	you mean /ignore
2007-05-15T08:47:00.000Z	Pelo	variant	 no , jjust a pm blocking scrip a freind of mine wrote,   it lets me allow ppl I want to ,  mostly it's to keep unwanted msg form spammers and such
2007-05-15T08:48:00.000Z	variant	Pelo	ok
2007-08-04T11:41:00.000Z	variant	Pelo	what good would that do, if the code only supports one platform it's not as simple as just recompiling it
2007-08-04T11:42:00.000Z	Pelo	variant	I was under the impression that a package built for amd64 would not work because of dependencies butthat you could  build from source wit the appropriate 32 bit dipendencies
2007-08-04T11:43:00.000Z	variant	Pelo	not if the platform in question is a spark
