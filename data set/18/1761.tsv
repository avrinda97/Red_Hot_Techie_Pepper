2011-01-21T16:45:00.000Z	meco		Since I upgraded to 10.0.4 LTS a few days ago, the PC crashes frequently. What should I do?
2011-01-21T16:46:00.000Z	ne2k	meco	describe your crashing symptoms in more detail
2011-01-21T16:48:00.000Z	meco	ne2k	I'm unsure about the exact circumstances as I'm not the only user of the machine, but the machine freezes up, no response on the caps lock light, the screen goes black, but the monitor power light is lit. I've been able to reboot some times by repeatedly hitting ctrl-alt-del
2011-01-21T16:49:00.000Z	ne2k	meco	if you have no caps lock response, it tends to imply a complete hardware crash. try running memtest
2011-01-21T16:50:00.000Z	meco	ne2k	ok, I'll start there
2011-01-21T17:11:00.000Z	meco	ne2k	I did the memory test, no problems there
2011-01-21T17:22:00.000Z	ne2k	meco	you're not overclocking, are you?
2011-01-21T17:23:00.000Z	ne2k	meco	that's not very old! that's moderately recent ;-)
2011-01-21T17:23:00.000Z	ne2k	meco	anyway, what did you have on it before?
2011-01-21T17:24:00.000Z	meco	ne2k	8.04
2011-01-21T17:24:00.000Z	ne2k	meco	it's either a hardware problem, in which case any OS would fail at some point, or it's a kernel/hardware incompatibility/instability, in which case it may be able to be fixed by tweaking kernel parameters and/or using a different kernel
2011-01-21T17:24:00.000Z	ne2k	meco	the trouble is finding out what the actual problem is
2011-01-21T17:25:00.000Z	ne2k	meco	you could see if there is a BIOS upgrade from the BIOS manufacturer as the first port of call?
2011-01-21T17:25:00.000Z	ne2k	meco	you could try turning off various things in the kernel parameters like acpi,
2011-01-21T17:25:00.000Z	ne2k	meco	I mix up apic and acpi... I had to turn off one of those on an old machine to mak eit work
2011-01-21T17:26:00.000Z	meco	ne2k	I don't have the BIOS password. I guess that precludes making any BIOS changes?
2011-01-21T17:26:00.000Z	ne2k	meco	not if you don't mind doing a hard reset on the BIOS -- there's usually a jumper you can put on a pair of pins to wipe it
2011-01-21T17:27:00.000Z	meco	ne2k	OK, that sounds feasible, except it's still a bit scary...
