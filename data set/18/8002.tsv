2007-11-01T02:34:00.000Z	PirateHead		Sound doesn't work since I upgraded from Feisty. Can anybody help me resolve that?
2007-11-01T02:35:00.000Z	emmajane	PirateHead	What's your sound card? Do you know?
2007-11-01T02:36:00.000Z	PirateHead	emmajane	from lspci: 00:14.2 Audio device: ATI Technologies Inc SB450 HDA Audio (rev 01)
2007-11-01T02:38:00.000Z	PirateHead	emmajane	why would it be muted by default? And if it is muted, how do I tell?
2007-11-01T02:38:00.000Z	PirateHead	emmajane	Nothing says "muted" when I run alsamixer.
2007-11-01T02:38:00.000Z	PirateHead	emmajane	done. I know to do that.
2007-11-01T02:39:00.000Z	PirateHead	emmajane	the "master" column says 00, and has no column at all
2007-11-01T02:39:00.000Z	PirateHead	emmajane	It's not that there's a column that just has no bars in it; there is no column, period.
2007-11-01T02:39:00.000Z	PirateHead	emmajane	the next one over, PCM, has red bars
2007-11-01T02:40:00.000Z	PirateHead	emmajane	up arrow has no effect. the "chip" is Realtek ALC861
2007-11-01T02:41:00.000Z	PirateHead	emmajane	yes, 2.6.22
2007-11-01T02:44:00.000Z	PirateHead	emmajane	it seems to break every time there's a kernel upgrade. :-(
2007-11-01T02:44:00.000Z	PirateHead	emmajane	It worked in Dapper and then broke in Edgy, then they fixed it in Edgy but it broke in Feisty, then they fixed it but now it's broken in Gutsy.
2007-11-01T02:45:00.000Z	PirateHead	emmajane	The kernel team should just stop fuxing with the sound drivers. :-)
2007-11-01T02:46:00.000Z	PirateHead	emmajane	I'm running on the cheapest piece of crap I could buy at the time, so it would actually not be too difficult! The problem is that the kernel developers, who have dual-core ThinkPads with a gig of RAM, would cringe to boot into it.
2007-11-01T02:47:00.000Z	PirateHead	emmajane	is it possible to download the old kernel and use it?
2007-11-01T02:47:00.000Z	PirateHead	emmajane	or do I have to do a fresh Feisty install?
2007-11-01T02:48:00.000Z	PirateHead	emmajane	I should just switch to Slackware then, or what?
