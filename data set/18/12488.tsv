2006-05-02T05:58:00.000Z	n00bie		hallo .. can anyone help me with my NTFS partitions ?
2006-05-02T05:58:00.000Z	_jason	n00bie	what is wrong with it?
2006-05-02T05:59:00.000Z	_jason	n00bie	do they show up in system > administration > disks
2006-05-02T06:00:00.000Z	_jason	n00bie	you can mount them there, though then I am not familiar with an easy way of changing permissions through gui (would have to edit fstab)
2006-05-02T06:01:00.000Z	_jason	n00bie	yeah
2006-05-02T06:02:00.000Z	n00bie	_jason	 it does not seem to work .. what to do next ?
2006-05-02T06:02:00.000Z	_jason	n00bie	what do you mean by ``does not seem to work'' ?  what happens?
2006-05-02T06:03:00.000Z	_jason	n00bie	does the disks manager say it is enabled?
2006-05-02T06:05:00.000Z	_jason	n00bie	ok, what is the device name? /dev/hda[what?] 
2006-05-02T06:07:00.000Z	_jason	n00bie	ok open accessories > terminal
2006-05-02T06:07:00.000Z	_jason	n00bie	sudo mkdir /media/windows
2006-05-02T06:09:00.000Z	_jason	n00bie	sudo mount -t ntfs -o ro,user,umask=0222 /dev/hdb1 /media/windows
2006-05-02T06:11:00.000Z	_jason	n00bie	umm is /dev/hdb1 a ntfs partition?
2006-05-02T06:12:00.000Z	_jason	n00bie	ok try sudo mount -t ntfs -o umask=0222 /dev/hdb1 /media/windows
2006-05-02T06:13:00.000Z	_jason	n00bie	check /media/windows now
2006-05-02T06:15:00.000Z	_jason	n00bie	should work
2006-05-02T06:15:00.000Z	_jason	n00bie	if you weren't on the livecd, I'd tell you about fstab, but no point on the live
2006-05-02T06:15:00.000Z	_jason	n00bie	that's some more info if you want to read it over
