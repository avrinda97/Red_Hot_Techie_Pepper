2005-05-18T11:42:00.000Z	Kamion	|iXiiOn|	say yes and don't worry about it? :-) If it can't download them, then it can't download them ...
2005-05-18T11:42:00.000Z	|iXiiOn|		it tells me that i need addition language packages and that it is going to download these now ( it is queestioning me )
2005-05-18T11:42:00.000Z	Kamion		the question's there so that if you're installing a thousand machines with CDs that don't have the right language-support-* on them, it won't kill your net connection as they all simultaneously go off to mirrors
2005-05-18T11:43:00.000Z	|iXiiOn|		there is no error message
2005-05-18T11:44:00.000Z	|iXiiOn|		so how can i see if he took the packages from cd ? maybe
2005-05-18T11:44:00.000Z	Kamion	|iXiiOn|	it'll be obvious if not, because it will spend time downloading and show a progress meter
2005-05-18T11:45:00.000Z	Kamion	|iXiiOn|	right at the very end of the installation
2005-05-18T11:45:00.000Z	|iXiiOn|	Kamion	yes
