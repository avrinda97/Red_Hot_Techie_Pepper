2010-07-29T18:25:00.000Z	neekers		in ubuntu, should new directives be put un apache2.conf or httpd.conf?
2010-07-29T18:25:00.000Z	neekers		un=in
2010-07-29T18:26:00.000Z	rww	neekers	apache2.conf for per-server directives, /etc/apache2/sites-available/nameofsitefile for per-site directives
2010-07-29T18:27:00.000Z	rww	neekers	httpd.conf only exists for compatibility reasons
2010-07-29T18:28:00.000Z	neekers	rww	would apache2.conf be a good place to put this script? http://perishablepress.com/press/2009/03/16/the-perishable-press-4g-blacklist/
2010-07-29T18:29:00.000Z	rww	neekers	yes
2010-07-29T18:30:00.000Z	neekers	rww	thanks, do you think that script is worth-while?
2010-07-29T18:32:00.000Z	rww	neekers	depends. It's not going to actually stop any exploits, because I can't see any on there that aren't already patched in applications. It would stop attempts from cluttering your logfiles, though.
2010-07-29T18:34:00.000Z	neekers	rww	ahh, i see. i do run apt-get update and apt-get upgrade monthly. are there other things you might suggest?
2010-07-29T18:36:00.000Z	rww	neekers	If you're using any web applications (Wordpress, Mediawiki, etc.) that you didn't install through the package manager, you need to keep them up-to-date yourself. The documentation for those applications usually says how to do that. Apart from that, you should be fine; Ubuntu's Apache2 configuration covers most of the security recommendations out there.
2010-07-29T18:37:00.000Z	neekers	rww	yes, i run a number of wordpress sites and have them updated to 3.0, i try to keep on top of updates
2010-07-29T18:42:00.000Z	neekers	rww	thanks for your help
2010-07-30T03:54:00.000Z	rww	neekers	it's mods-enabled and mods-available, but yes
2010-07-30T03:55:00.000Z	rww	neekers	you can enable and disable mods with a2enmod and a2dismod
2010-09-21T13:39:00.000Z	rww	neekers	which part of it?
2010-09-21T13:40:00.000Z	rww	neekers	assuming you're using default Apache log format, that's the User-Agent string provided by the client. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User-Agent
2010-09-21T13:41:00.000Z	neekers	rww	the request is coming from an Android cell phone application, so that just indicates that?
2010-09-21T13:42:00.000Z	rww	neekers	Sure. It's just what the client says it is. It doesn't have an intrinsic meaning. Many browsers can be configured to send whatever you want for that.
