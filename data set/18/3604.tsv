2010-05-16T22:12:00.000Z	sandking		is there an app that will show me what key i am pressing?
2010-05-16T22:13:00.000Z	sandking		i got some issues with dosbox and mac keyboard
2010-05-16T22:13:00.000Z	airtonix	sandking	yes.
2011-08-21T17:56:00.000Z	airtonix	sandking	that fact that you use dyndns has no affect on which ports you open.
2011-08-21T17:56:00.000Z	sandking	airtonix	i got no idea how to start remote desktop under ubuntu and a bad headache worsens my cognition abilities :|
2011-08-21T17:57:00.000Z	airtonix	sandking	you also need to be more precise as to what you mean by "remote desktop" what server software is it?
2011-08-21T17:57:00.000Z	sandking	airtonix	i want to use default option in ubuntu 11.04
2011-08-21T17:58:00.000Z	airtonix	sandking	i do believe the configuration interface for the default remote desktop shows you the ports
2011-08-21T17:58:00.000Z	airtonix	sandking	isn't airport a piece of apple hardware? it's just a wifi router
2011-08-21T17:59:00.000Z	sandking	airtonix	yeah, but setup utility works for me only under windows
2011-08-21T17:59:00.000Z	airtonix	sandking	why do you need a setup utility?
2011-08-21T18:00:00.000Z	sandking	airtonix	it's just an app to set it up - i don't know if you can access configuration panel via typing ip address in browser
2011-08-21T18:03:00.000Z	airtonix	sandking	if it's not the device that provides you with WAN access then i'm not sure why you need to be concerned with it at all
2011-08-21T18:03:00.000Z	airtonix	sandking	since in that case it's just a wifi switch
2011-08-21T18:05:00.000Z	sandking	airtonix	to be honest i'm completely lost with this remote desktop thing. i'm trying to go with this guide http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/connect-home-network-dyndns/ but i'm stuck at "configure your router" as i don't know where to put dyndns info
2011-08-21T18:05:00.000Z	airtonix	sandking	in the device that provides you with itnernet access (WAN) and allows you to configure port forwarding
2011-08-21T18:08:00.000Z	sandking	airtonix	can i configure several machines in my lan to acces from outside on the same port?
2011-08-21T18:12:00.000Z	airtonix	sandking	no
