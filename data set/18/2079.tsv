2010-08-25T03:21:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	bluezone	check the permission on the folder you are uploading to
2010-08-25T03:28:00.000Z	bluezone	ZykoticK9	uhh how would i modify the permissions of the folder
2010-08-25T03:29:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	bluezone	right click if using Nautilus or use chmod/chown from cli.
2010-08-25T04:11:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	bluezone	oussama "sudo su" is NOT the proper method - if you really need root use "sudo -i"
2011-01-15T09:45:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	bluezone	if you are using the OS nvidia driver then nvidia-settings no longer applies
2011-01-15T09:46:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	bluezone	to be honest - i think it's a waste of an nvidia card to use the OS drivers - 3D is not prime-time there yet
2011-01-15T09:47:00.000Z	bluezone	ZykoticK9	yeah but installing the other driver doesnt work either, i already mentioned my problems abouve if u were here awhile ago
2011-01-15T09:49:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	bluezone	nvidia-xconfig said in it's output that it created a new xorg.conf for you.
2011-01-15T09:51:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	bluezone	nv "might" still work though
2011-01-15T09:51:00.000Z	bluezone	ZykoticK9	at this point i am oppened to even going back to ubuntu 1.0 if both my wireless and video card drivers work :(
2011-01-15T09:52:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	bluezone	lol - there was never an ubuntu 1.0 - but i get your point
2011-01-15T09:52:00.000Z	bluezone	ZykoticK9	yep lol
