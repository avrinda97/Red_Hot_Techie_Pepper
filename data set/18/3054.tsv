2010-05-20T17:05:00.000Z	peterson		hello, my name is Peterson. I've installed Kubuntu (but it's not a KDE thing, so that's ok to ask here)  in dual-boot and now I'm not able to boot into windows XP anymore. I've used linux exclusevely for years, the thing is that the problem is not in my computer, rather in my school's one. I'm installing ubuntu so we can use it on digital boards, but because of other educational software we gotta have windows as well.
2010-05-20T17:05:00.000Z	peterson		it says disk read error.
2010-05-20T17:06:00.000Z	st__	peterson	what had happened before winxp loader broke?
2010-05-20T17:07:00.000Z	peterson	st__	nothing
2010-05-20T17:08:00.000Z	st__	peterson	installing Linux isn't 'nothing'
2010-05-20T17:09:00.000Z	peterson	st__	sorry
2010-05-20T17:10:00.000Z	peterson	st__	I meant that.. well, everything worked
2010-05-20T17:10:00.000Z	st__	peterson	what is your partition configuration?
2010-05-20T17:11:00.000Z	peterson	st__	just a sec..
2010-05-20T17:12:00.000Z	peterson	st__	there's kind of 1 MiB unallocated at the beginning of the disk
2010-05-20T17:12:00.000Z	peterson	st__	then comes /dev/sda1, with windows
2010-05-20T17:12:00.000Z	peterson	st__	which takes 93 GiB
2010-05-20T17:12:00.000Z	peterson	st__	then /ð€?v
2010-05-20T17:13:00.000Z	peterson	st__	sorry - then /dev/sda5 with ubuntu, /dev/sda6 with swap
2010-05-20T17:13:00.000Z	peterson	st__	inside an extended partition which takes up 139 GiB
2010-05-20T17:18:00.000Z	st__	peterson	so what exactly happens when you're choosing 'Vista loader' in Grub menu?
2010-05-20T17:18:00.000Z	peterson	st__	it says read disk error, ctrl+alt+del to restart
2010-05-20T17:18:00.000Z	peterson	st__	and then it reboots
