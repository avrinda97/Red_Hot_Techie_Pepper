2009-04-09T19:27:00.000Z	Vaporize		and i'm pretty sure it isn't due it's popularity
2009-04-09T19:28:00.000Z	Vaporize		does anyone but bencrisford know the differences between debian and ubuntu :P
2009-04-09T19:30:00.000Z	Vaporize		i'm using ion3 go for that :P
2009-04-09T19:31:00.000Z	Vaporize		i think it's a matter of what your used to
2009-04-09T19:32:00.000Z	Vaporize		i've been using ion3 for half a year or so and then started to try out some other tiling window managers
2009-04-09T19:32:00.000Z	Vaporize		i'm just used to the keybinds and stuff of ion3
2009-04-09T19:33:00.000Z	Vaporize		and i'm not sure if it was wmii but of some i didn't like the fact that they are tiling but also support some floating windows
2009-04-09T19:34:00.000Z	Vaporize		yeah well that's the only thing i don't like in ion3
2009-04-09T19:34:00.000Z	Vaporize		that i've to scale and order the tiles to get gimp to work fine
2009-04-09T19:34:00.000Z	Vaporize		still don't get why they use that layout anyway
2009-04-09T19:36:00.000Z	Mion	Vaporize	just float gimp
2009-04-09T19:37:00.000Z	Mion	Vaporize	don't know if ion3 can float, I don't use it since the dev is a santorum
2009-04-09T19:39:00.000Z	Vaporize	Mion	well it doesn't seem to be very "ion3" to be able to do that :P
2009-04-09T19:39:00.000Z	Mion	Vaporize	almost every other tiling vm out there can float spesific apps
2009-04-09T19:41:00.000Z	Vaporize	Mion	but i believe ion3 is still from the dark ages, ion actualy inspired most new window managers acording to wikipedia
2009-04-09T19:41:00.000Z	Mion	Vaporize	whoever wrote that page must have been drunk
2009-04-09T19:44:00.000Z	Vaporize	Mion	lol well they're not talking about ion3 but the oldest one, plain ion
2009-04-09T19:44:00.000Z	Mion	Vaporize	same
