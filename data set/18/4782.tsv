2009-02-10T18:41:00.000Z	Bodsda		how can i exclude a folder from a mv command? i want to do  mv ./* ./folder/  without trying to move folder into itself, so i need to exclude it
2009-02-10T18:41:00.000Z	hugh_path	Bodsda	please read the mv man page (man mv).
2009-02-10T18:42:00.000Z	Bodsda	hugh_path	it does not mention anything about exclusion
2009-02-10T18:43:00.000Z	hugh_path	Bodsda	Right, there is none.  It will notice if you try to move it's self (.) and gripe that you can't do that.
2009-02-10T18:43:00.000Z	Bodsda	hugh_path	huh? are you saying i cant do this?
2009-02-10T18:43:00.000Z	hugh_path	Bodsda	Now what you can do is move files like this "mv * .??*" will move most everything but odd cases like .x, which are rare in Unix.
2009-02-10T18:44:00.000Z	Bodsda	hugh_path	yes, but that assumes all my files are of the same extension, i have about 20 different file extensions in that folder
2009-02-10T18:44:00.000Z	hugh_path	Bodsda	The man page is the final word, unless you use some other application (or write one).
2009-02-10T18:44:00.000Z	Bodsda	hugh_path	thanks for your time
2009-02-10T18:45:00.000Z	hugh_path	Bodsda	no, my example has nothing to do with extensions, that is not really a valid concept in Unix.
2009-02-10T18:45:00.000Z	hugh_path	Bodsda	you should read up on your shell (likely Bash) to see how it does wildcards as that is what folks use in Unix to choose groups of things.
2009-02-10T18:46:00.000Z	Bodsda	hugh_path	what do you mean, "see how it does wildcards"?
2009-02-10T18:47:00.000Z	hugh_path	Bodsda	Most shells in unix provide for "wildcards", magic characters that the shell expands into more then one file name, such as "less foo*" which will show you every file in this directory that begins with foo.
2009-02-10T18:48:00.000Z	Bodsda	hugh_path	yeah, i know what wildcards are
2009-02-10T18:48:00.000Z	hugh_path	Bodsda	the '*' is the wild card and is explained in the bash man page (if your using bash).
2009-02-10T18:48:00.000Z	hugh_path	Bodsda	so try "ls .??*"
2009-02-10T18:49:00.000Z	Bodsda	hugh_path	ls is not going to help me copy files is it?
2009-02-10T18:50:00.000Z	hugh_path	Bodsda	No, but it will let you prototype the command that will, once you have the right files listed by doing ls WHATEVER, then you can do mv -t targetdir WHATWORKS.
