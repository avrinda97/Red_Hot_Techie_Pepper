2006-08-25T07:20:00.000Z	viator	cafuego	does canonical pay you
2006-08-25T07:20:00.000Z	cafuego	viator	nope
2006-09-04T10:52:00.000Z	cafuego	viator	Some do, yes.
2006-09-04T10:52:00.000Z	viator	cafuego	yeah everything ecvept broacom
2006-09-04T10:52:00.000Z	cafuego	viator	Ha. I have a broadcom card which works just fine.
2006-09-04T10:53:00.000Z	cafuego	viator	However, inserting an pcmcia card in this HP makes it hardlock.
2006-10-02T06:30:00.000Z	cafuego	viator	it should, yes
2006-10-02T06:30:00.000Z	viator	cafuego	but not out of the box right
2006-10-02T06:31:00.000Z	cafuego	viator	No, you will need the firmware - that's not in Ubuntu.
2006-10-02T06:31:00.000Z	cafuego	viator	Yeah, check ubuntu.caguego.net -> there is a firmware package.
2006-10-02T06:32:00.000Z	cafuego	viator	You may or may not need to do a small tweak before the card will work after that; some bcm4318's need you to run 'iwconfig ethX rate 11M' before they'll work.
2007-10-20T05:41:00.000Z	viator	cafuego	you are pretty knowlegeable when it comes to wireless
2007-10-20T05:42:00.000Z	cafuego	viator	Dunno, that sounds very odd, not something I've heard about before.
