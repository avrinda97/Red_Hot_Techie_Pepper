2010-05-01T23:21:00.000Z	balleyne		just upgraded to 10.04, but desktop effects are disabled and I can't turn them on via System > Appearance anymore. Thoughts on troubleshooting?
2010-05-01T23:22:00.000Z	balleyne		andrew___: yeah, desktop effects is compiz, isn't it? can't enable it anymore
2010-05-01T23:23:00.000Z	soreau	balleyne	Can you pastebin the output of 'compiz --replace &' from your terminal to pastebin.org ?
2010-05-01T23:24:00.000Z	balleyne	soreau	http://pastebin.org/197140 -- thanks
2010-05-01T23:25:00.000Z	soreau	balleyne	Your drivers are screwed up. Can you pastebin your X log? (/var/log/Xorg.0.log file)
2010-05-01T23:27:00.000Z	balleyne	soreau	http://pastebin.org/197143 -- thanks very much
2010-05-01T23:28:00.000Z	soreau	balleyne	You have the nvidia driver installed but your chipset is reported as Intel
2010-05-01T23:28:00.000Z	balleyne	soreau	weird. my chipset is definitely intel and not nvidia. pointers on how to fix it?
2010-05-01T23:29:00.000Z	soreau	balleyne	I have someone who just fixed this same issue in #compiz
2010-05-01T23:29:00.000Z	soreau	balleyne	First, review the output of 'dpkg -l|grep nvidia'  and .. pastebin it
2010-05-01T23:30:00.000Z	balleyne	soreau	http://pastebin.org/197145 -- thank you
2010-05-01T23:31:00.000Z	soreau	balleyne	Ok, remove all the packages that have 'ii' next to them (which means they're currently installed)
2010-05-01T23:32:00.000Z	soreau	balleyne	After removing those packages, hopefully it will work after a reboot
2010-05-01T23:33:00.000Z	soreau	balleyne	But it's not a bad idea to reinstall libgl1-mesa-glx and -dri
2010-05-01T23:33:00.000Z	soreau	balleyne	After removing the nvidia packages
2010-05-01T23:33:00.000Z	balleyne	soreau	ok, cool, thanks, I'll do that too
2010-05-01T23:42:00.000Z	balleyne	soreau	uninstalled those nvidia packages, restarted my xserver, and I was able to re-enable compiz -- thanks!
2010-05-01T23:42:00.000Z	soreau	balleyne	Great! :)
