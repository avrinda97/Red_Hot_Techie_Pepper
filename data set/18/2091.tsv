2012-11-23T08:45:00.000Z	lahwran		how do I tell what version of fglrx I have installed? and once I know, how would I go from there to the experimental drivers that steam needs to run?
2012-11-23T08:46:00.000Z	almoxarife	lahwran	has someone set the drivers up on a ppa?
2012-11-23T08:46:00.000Z	lahwran	almoxarife	I don't know, which is why I'm asking
2012-11-23T08:47:00.000Z	almoxarife	lahwran	so you would like to have someome research that for you?
2012-11-23T08:49:00.000Z	almoxarife	lahwran	i am willing to help, you google it though, tag the drivers to a ppa and give me the link
2012-11-23T08:58:00.000Z	lahwran	almoxarife	so it looks like I have fglrx-updates installed, but I'm supposed to install fglrx-experimental-something
2012-11-23T08:58:00.000Z	lahwran	almoxarife	I don't see that when I apt-cache search fglrx
2012-11-23T08:58:00.000Z	almoxarife	lahwran	where would the 'experimental' come from?
2012-11-23T08:58:00.000Z	lahwran	almoxarife	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Valve
2012-11-23T09:00:00.000Z	almoxarife	lahwran	In 12.04, launch the Additional Hardware Drivers dialog from System Settings. In 12.10, launch Software Properties, then click on the Additional Drivers tab in the Software Sources menu. <-- did you follow those directions?
2012-11-23T09:00:00.000Z	lahwran	almoxarife	I did, and I only see fglrx and fglrx-updates
2012-11-23T09:01:00.000Z	almoxarife	lahwran	Download the Steam Client. <-- did you do that part? it may be in the package?
2012-11-23T09:02:00.000Z	lahwran	almoxarife	do you intend to be helpful with this, or are you just going to insult me?
2012-11-23T09:02:00.000Z	almoxarife	lahwran	the first, the latter insults me too
2012-11-23T09:03:00.000Z	almoxarife	lahwran	i dont know jack about steam or ati drivers, so its a matter of finding the 'experimental' drivers
2012-11-23T09:04:00.000Z	lahwran	almoxarife	okay, look, this is what I did: I installed fglrx-updates, then downloaded steam and tf2. I tried to run it and it complained about the driver missing extensions. I happen to have already read about there being an experimental driver, so I assumed that the problem was that I need said experimental driver. however, I don't see it in the repos, despiet that the wiki page claims it should be in the 12.04 default repos
2012-11-23T09:06:00.000Z	lahwran	almoxarife	found it, it was in the partner repo
2012-11-23T09:07:00.000Z	almoxarife	lahwran	:)
