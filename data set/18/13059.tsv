2006-01-17T14:27:00.000Z	NickZA		ok im stumped at phase 1, i want to create a test page but I cant write to /var/www can someone help me pls
2006-01-17T14:29:00.000Z	tkroo	NickZA	you should put your web files into your users site folder? not /var/www/
2006-01-17T14:30:00.000Z	tkroo	NickZA	but i don't know what you have set up
2006-01-17T14:30:00.000Z	NickZA	tkroo	just installed apache,mysql and php with all its default settings
2006-01-17T14:31:00.000Z	tkroo	NickZA	ok, so where do you point your browser to look at your webserver root?
2006-01-17T14:31:00.000Z	NickZA	tkroo	simply using local ip address
2006-01-17T14:31:00.000Z	tkroo	NickZA	probably localhost or ip, hmmm,
2006-01-17T14:37:00.000Z	NickZA	tkroo	the pages that are pulled up be default are located under var/www/apache2-default but I have no access there
2006-01-17T14:39:00.000Z	tkroo	NickZA	do a search for "index.html.nl" that should reside in the directory you are looking for.    try #apache?
2006-01-17T14:40:00.000Z	NickZA	tkroo	that page is also under var/www/apache2-default
2006-01-17T14:44:00.000Z	tkroo	NickZA	i'm not sure, srry
2006-01-17T14:49:00.000Z	tkroo	NickZA	http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/core.html#documentroot
2006-01-17T15:23:00.000Z	tkroo	NickZA	find your httpd.conf file
2006-01-17T15:25:00.000Z	tkroo	NickZA	:)
2006-01-17T15:25:00.000Z	tkroo	NickZA	there's gotta be an apache config file somewhere there :)
2006-01-17T15:31:00.000Z	tkroo	NickZA	if you search in httpd.conf there's a section called DocumentRoot, that should show you the path to your web served directory
2006-01-17T15:36:00.000Z	tkroo	NickZA	you found a file called httpd.conf? and it was empty?
2006-01-17T15:53:00.000Z	tkroo	NickZA	you can create a php file with this in it: <?php phpinfo() ?>
