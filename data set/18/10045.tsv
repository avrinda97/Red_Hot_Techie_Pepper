2008-10-01T21:05:00.000Z	coke19		i need some help with an apache2 virtual host problem
2008-10-01T21:05:00.000Z	unop	coke19	ask the channel your question - if's its quite complicated, there's always #apache
2008-10-01T21:08:00.000Z	unop	coke19	is apache listening on that ip address?
2008-10-01T21:10:00.000Z	unop	coke19	do you have a vhost config file for the particular IP address/domain name ??
2008-10-01T21:10:00.000Z	unop	coke19	usually called a site - in /etc/apache2/sites-enabled
2008-10-01T21:11:00.000Z	unop	coke19	but how exactly have you done that??
2008-10-01T21:14:00.000Z	unop	coke19	use a pastebin and dump this there.
2008-10-01T21:17:00.000Z	unop	coke19	is www.mysite.com set to resolve to your router's public IP address??
2008-10-01T21:17:00.000Z	unop	coke19	ok, so what's the problem then? this virtual host does not take effect??
2008-10-01T21:18:00.000Z	unop	coke19	try changing the VirtualHost directive to.   <VirtualHost www.mysite.com>
2008-10-01T21:18:00.000Z	unop	coke19	or even <VirtualHost *>
2008-10-01T21:19:00.000Z	unop	coke19	right, but your using a private IP address to serve a public site
2008-10-01T21:19:00.000Z	unop	coke19	that can't be right
2008-10-01T21:20:00.000Z	unop	coke19	see - http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/vhosts/name-based.html
2008-10-01T21:21:00.000Z	unop	coke19	but does bind resolve www.mysite.com to 192.168.0.27 ??
2008-10-01T21:21:00.000Z	unop	coke19	i should think not and be surprised if it does - it shouldn't
2008-10-01T21:26:00.000Z	unop	coke19	you might like to ask the guys in #apache then
