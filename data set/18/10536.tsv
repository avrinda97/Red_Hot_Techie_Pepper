2008-07-02T14:39:00.000Z	ronny		hi
2008-07-02T14:40:00.000Z	ronny		i managed to bork my sudoers file, is there any way to change it without needing to boot form external media ? (su/sudo wont work any more)
2008-07-02T14:40:00.000Z	ronny		btw, why is there no real password for root users ?
2008-07-02T14:41:00.000Z	Slart	ronny	because in ubuntu you're not supposed to use the root account
2008-07-02T14:41:00.000Z	ronny	Slart	whats that for a cheap excuse ?
2008-07-02T14:41:00.000Z	Slart	ronny	well.. it's the excuse the ubuntu designers used..
2009-02-05T23:46:00.000Z	Slart	ronny	you've searched in synaptic?
2009-02-05T23:55:00.000Z	ronny	Slart	found nothing - only the source for the normal kernel
2009-02-05T23:55:00.000Z	Slart	ronny	hmm.. hang on.. let me look around, see what I can find... you're running ubuntu 8.10 server 32bit, right?
2009-02-05T23:56:00.000Z	ronny	Slart	its not a actual server, i just need the server kernel for my 4gb of ram
2009-02-05T23:56:00.000Z	Slart	ronny	ok, but it's still 8.10 32bit?
2009-02-05T23:57:00.000Z	Slart	ronny	I'll be right back
2009-02-05T23:59:00.000Z	Slart	ronny	the server kernel and the desktop kernel seems to use the same source package
2009-02-05T23:59:00.000Z	Slart	ronny	at least according to what I can see
2009-02-06T00:00:00.000Z	Slart	ronny	so install linux-source-2.6.27
2009-02-06T00:01:00.000Z	ronny	Slart	thats installed
2009-02-06T00:01:00.000Z	ronny	Slart	i tihnk dmks expects different paths
2009-02-06T00:01:00.000Z	Slart	ronny	tried installing the headers too?
