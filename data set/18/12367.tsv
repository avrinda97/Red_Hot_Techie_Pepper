2006-04-29T06:26:00.000Z	Emess		ok this is wierd, im isntalling ubuntu and when i get to the partitioning part it jsut repepatedly says 'Killed' and jsut keeps on repeating...
2006-04-29T06:26:00.000Z	Emess		from the forums it seems to be a problem on computers with 64mb rasm...which is what this box has :(
2006-04-29T06:28:00.000Z	ompaul	Emess	that is so small I don't think you will get much use out of that install, that is a very low spec machine I would suggest that you use DSL (damn small linux) or install server first and see if you can get xubuntu-desktop working on it - its really low on resources
2006-04-29T06:31:00.000Z	Emess	ompaul	its a good system, jsut low on ram. it wont run DSL (monitor rejects the resolution it uses) but its failing on partitioning, not the actual OS
2006-04-29T06:34:00.000Z	ompaul	Emess	for dsl start the boot with vga=771
2006-04-29T06:36:00.000Z	ompaul	Emess	how big is the drive?
2006-04-29T06:37:00.000Z	ompaul	Emess	whats on it?
2006-04-29T06:38:00.000Z	ompaul	Emess	partition wise what do you want to do with it
2006-04-29T06:40:00.000Z	Emess	ompaul	its empty now, 9.6GB ext3 and 512MB of swap
2006-04-29T06:41:00.000Z	ompaul	Emess	so try to do a server install from the off
2006-04-29T06:42:00.000Z	Emess	ompaul	server misntall? off?
2006-04-29T06:43:00.000Z	ompaul	Emess	as the machine boots, it pauses, type server and work away from there
2006-04-29T06:47:00.000Z	Emess	ompaul	now its giving a segmentation fault on teh drive at partition stage
2006-04-29T06:48:00.000Z	ompaul	Emess	while the machine your on is way below spec - I would now suspect the media more than anything
2006-04-29T06:52:00.000Z	Emess	ompaul	thanks, i think iv found the problem, it was burned at 16x the first time insteadc of 4x, il see how it goes after reburning
2006-04-29T06:52:00.000Z	ompaul	Emess	good luck
2006-04-29T07:28:00.000Z	Emess	ompaul	nope, when i do normal install it jsut repeats "killed" ans when i  do server it says "segmentation fault" i guess therses jsut not enough ram, it cant partition the drive
2006-04-29T07:29:00.000Z	ompaul	Emess	dsl ? ;-)
