2010-06-07T12:15:00.000Z	theadmin	tripelb	How did you install it?
2010-06-07T12:16:00.000Z	theadmin	tripelb	Maybe Plymouth :/
2010-06-07T12:17:00.000Z	tripelb	theadmin	I cant remember. I tried to upgrade it with the website but that didnt work. I think I used apt-get. Synaptic never works for me.
2010-06-07T12:17:00.000Z	theadmin	tripelb	Apt-get, Synaptic, same thing
2010-06-07T12:17:00.000Z	theadmin	tripelb	Should be like "sudo apt-get purge vuze" then, I guess
2010-06-07T12:17:00.000Z	tripelb	theadmin	what does plymouth ahve to do with boot speed?
2010-06-07T12:17:00.000Z	theadmin	tripelb	Well, it's a bootsplash, so who knows, it also might slow it down
2010-06-07T12:17:00.000Z	tripelb	theadmin	thanks. I never heard of that command.
2010-06-07T12:18:00.000Z	theadmin	tripelb	"purge" is like "remove" but removes config-files too
2010-06-07T12:19:00.000Z	theadmin	tripelb	...what
2010-06-07T12:21:00.000Z	tripelb	theadmin	vuze is not installed therefor not removed (no it just starts up and shows in the menu), so I did autoremove (it was suggested), now vuze is GONE from the applications Internet menu.  Thanks to You!
2010-06-07T12:22:00.000Z	theadmin	tripelb	Heh, that wasn't a problem %)

2010-06-07T12:23:00.000Z	theadmin	tripelb	Noone knows, noone answers :P Also, use teh tab button
2010-06-07T12:24:00.000Z	theadmin	tripelb	Try: type "mgiam" and hit tab
2010-06-08T08:19:00.000Z	theadmin	tripelb	What's "hulu"?
