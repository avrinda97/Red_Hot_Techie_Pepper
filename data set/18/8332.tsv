2008-02-07T07:18:00.000Z	iDivine_		Umm, I don't think I have enough ram for Compiz fusion.
2008-02-07T07:19:00.000Z	iDivine_		I'm not quite sure about video, But I think ram I have around 512?...
2008-02-07T07:19:00.000Z	iDivine_		I've heard I have a bad video card as well..

2008-02-07T07:20:00.000Z	nemilar	iDivine_	the 'free' command will tell you how much ram you have
2008-02-07T07:21:00.000Z	nemilar	iDivine_	on the "Mem:" line, the "total" column
2008-02-07T07:21:00.000Z	nemilar	iDivine_	it's measured in Kilobytes
2008-02-07T07:21:00.000Z	nemilar	iDivine_	yeah, that's 512MB
2008-02-07T07:22:00.000Z	nemilar	iDivine_	compiz puts more strain on your video card and processor than it does your RAM, but 512 is more than enough RAM yeah
2008-02-07T07:25:00.000Z	nemilar	iDivine_	do you know what kind of video card you have?  or how old is your computer?
2008-02-07T07:26:00.000Z	nemilar	iDivine_	what tigran just said will give you the info
2008-02-07T07:26:00.000Z	nemilar	iDivine_	that's the same thing I've got :D
2008-02-07T07:27:00.000Z	nemilar	iDivine_	works fine for compiz right out of the fox
2008-02-07T07:27:00.000Z	nemilar	iDivine_	haha, box, not fox
2008-02-07T07:27:00.000Z	nemilar	iDivine_	you should be able to just turn on Compiz, and have everything working
