2005-07-27T06:03:00.000Z	Cooner750		Now. How do I install Ubuntu to that partition?
2005-07-27T06:03:00.000Z	Cooner750		Use the Ubuntu Install CD?
2005-07-27T06:04:00.000Z	Cooner750		how long does a Ubuntu install take?

2005-07-27T06:04:00.000Z	Cooner750		do I have to use the Install CD
2005-07-27T06:05:00.000Z	socomm	Cooner750	Depends on your hardware.
2005-07-27T06:05:00.000Z	socomm	Cooner750	Ubuntu defaults to GRUB.
2005-07-27T06:06:00.000Z	socomm	Cooner750	Should not take too long.
2005-07-27T06:11:00.000Z	socomm	Cooner750	You're prompted for whichever you like.
2005-07-27T06:11:00.000Z	socomm	Cooner750	You could write to the MBR or make a boot floopy.
2005-07-27T06:15:00.000Z	socomm	Cooner750	Doubtful.
2005-07-27T06:16:00.000Z	socomm	Cooner750	As easy as the XP installer.
2005-07-27T06:50:00.000Z	socomm	Cooner750	This is most likely a hardware issue.
