2008-08-21T20:18:00.000Z	Tamale		can someone help me change my DHCP timeout please?
2008-08-21T20:19:00.000Z	bobertdos	Tamale	using dhcp3-server?
2008-08-21T20:19:00.000Z	Tamale	bobertdos	Just ubuntu hardy
2008-08-21T20:20:00.000Z	bobertdos	Tamale	Are you talking about the timeout of a DHCP server you've set up or of your own router?
2008-08-21T20:20:00.000Z	Tamale	bobertdos	No, I'm talking about my dhcp client
2008-08-21T20:21:00.000Z	Tamale	bobertdos	it doesn't wait long enough for our server, so I never get an IP address when I boot up
2008-08-21T20:21:00.000Z	Tamale	bobertdos	I have to manually run "dhclient eth0" everytime I start up
2008-08-21T20:25:00.000Z	bobertdos	Tamale	For the sake of argument, what is the timeout value in dhclient.conf?
2008-08-21T20:25:00.000Z	Tamale	bobertdos	where is that conf?
2008-08-21T20:26:00.000Z	bobertdos	Tamale	/etc/dhcp3
2008-08-21T20:27:00.000Z	Tamale	bobertdos	almost the entire screipt is commented out
2008-08-21T20:27:00.000Z	bobertdos	Tamale	I know, but timeout shouldn't be.
2008-08-21T20:27:00.000Z	Tamale	bobertdos	it's not, it's 40
2008-08-21T20:29:00.000Z	bobertdos	Tamale	I'd first try increasing that value then. Your server must be pretty slow. Mine is set to 30 :p
2008-08-21T20:29:00.000Z	Tamale	bobertdos	it's just weird.. it works pretty fast after I'm all booted up and logged in
2008-08-21T20:30:00.000Z	Tamale	bobertdos	I just wish it had an IP already when I was logged in like it did in Gutsy
2008-08-21T20:30:00.000Z	Tamale	bobertdos	what changed in networking with the change to hardy?
2008-08-21T20:31:00.000Z	bobertdos	Tamale	I don't know. If you've still got a Gutsy CD around, I suppose you could always compare and contrast the dhclient.conf files.
