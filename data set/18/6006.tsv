2008-07-16T01:33:00.000Z	ASULutzy		so sudo iptables -L shows my current firewall rules, how do I remove all firewall rules?
2008-07-16T01:33:00.000Z	fantomas	ASULutzy	flush?
2008-07-16T01:33:00.000Z	fantomas	ASULutzy	man iptables then / then flush
2008-07-16T01:34:00.000Z	ASULutzy	fantomas	Oh duh, that was an RTFM'er there.
2008-07-16T04:47:00.000Z	ASULutzy	fantomas	scale
2008-07-16T04:47:00.000Z	fantomas	ASULutzy	ty
2008-07-16T04:47:00.000Z	ASULutzy	fantomas	I believe
2008-07-16T04:48:00.000Z	fantomas	ASULutzy	looks like it has another name. All 'scale' effects are turned on
2008-07-16T04:49:00.000Z	ASULutzy	fantomas	No, it's scale, you need to set the edge trigger
2008-07-16T04:49:00.000Z	ASULutzy	fantomas	Go to bindings inside the scale plugin, and then change initiate window picker to topLeft, etc
2008-07-16T04:49:00.000Z	fantomas	ASULutzy	sorry, you are right. Bindings are not set
2008-07-16T04:50:00.000Z	ASULutzy	fantomas	no problem ;)
2008-07-16T04:50:00.000Z	fantomas	ASULutzy	have you fixed the problen with iptables? :)
2008-07-16T04:51:00.000Z	ASULutzy	fantomas	Yea, it was something dumb ;) I flushed them and the default rule was to block all, but then when I restarted firestarter restored the old rules... Basically I forgot that I had installed firestarter a long time ago; that's where all those rules came from
2008-07-16T04:52:00.000Z	fantomas	ASULutzy	okay. Actually the most clear way to handle firewall rules which I found is using iptables-restore/save
2008-07-16T19:48:00.000Z	ASULutzy	fantomas	don't login as root, use sudo
2008-07-16T19:49:00.000Z	fantomas	ASULutzy	how can I use sudo if it is web interfaces. I said: SWAT question
2008-07-16T20:53:00.000Z	ASULutzy	fantomas	Yea, I thought you had to logout and backin
