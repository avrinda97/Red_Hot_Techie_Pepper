2007-11-06T19:17:00.000Z	dn4		when I use the nvidia glx legacy drivers my Riva TNT2 will not give me a login screen after rebooting
2007-11-06T19:17:00.000Z	dn4		using Gutsy
2007-11-06T19:17:00.000Z	dn4		also I cannot do alt+ctrl+1
2007-11-06T19:17:00.000Z	dn4		which makes it even harder for me to solve any problems
2007-11-06T19:18:00.000Z	Ax-Ax	dn4	Ctrl-Alt-F4?
2007-11-06T19:19:00.000Z	dn4	Ax-Ax	 you know to go from the login gui back to console mode and edit the configure file xorg.cfg
2007-11-06T19:20:00.000Z	Ax-Ax	dn4	i cant use my lagacy drivers too :(
2007-11-06T19:20:00.000Z	dn4	Ax-Ax	on Gutsy?
2007-11-06T19:20:00.000Z	Ax-Ax	dn4	yes
2007-11-06T19:21:00.000Z	Ax-Ax	dn4	i couldnt in feisty either
2007-11-06T19:21:00.000Z	Ax-Ax	dn4	it only worked in edgy for me
2007-11-06T19:22:00.000Z	dn4	Ax-Ax	hmm
2007-11-06T19:22:00.000Z	dn4	Ax-Ax	maybe we have to install the legacy drivers using the edgy method
2007-11-06T19:22:00.000Z	Ax-Ax	dn4	which method?
2007-11-07T02:51:00.000Z	Ax-Ax	dn4	now my nvidia driver work
