2006-01-10T17:25:00.000Z	Belboz99		Hey, how do I add an application that uses the "sh" command or the "./" on the panel?
2006-01-10T17:25:00.000Z	jenda-zZz	Belboz99	add custom launcher
2006-01-10T17:26:00.000Z	jenda-zZz	Belboz99	and then type the whole command
2006-01-10T17:26:00.000Z	Belboz99	jenda-zZz	what about the syntax?
2006-01-10T17:26:00.000Z	Belboz99		I'm not sure where to put the sh or the ./
2006-01-10T17:26:00.000Z	jenda-zZz	Belboz99	sh /path/of/file
2006-01-10T17:27:00.000Z	jenda-zZz		hello Aven
2006-01-10T17:27:00.000Z	Belboz99	jenda-zZz	I tried that and it doesn't work.
2006-01-10T17:27:00.000Z	jenda-zZz	Belboz99	how does it not work? try typing it in the term
2006-01-10T17:27:00.000Z	Belboz99	jenda-zZz	does it matter if there is an espace character in the path to the file?
2006-01-10T17:28:00.000Z	Belboz99		escape*
2006-01-10T17:28:00.000Z	jenda-zZz	Belboz99	YES! You mean a space? If there is, then you have to put the whole path in ""
2006-01-10T17:29:00.000Z	Belboz99		cannot execute binary file
2006-01-10T17:29:00.000Z	Belboz99	jenda-zZz	it's a "\ "
2006-01-10T17:30:00.000Z	jenda-zZz	Belboz99	Then it's a binary file. You first have to make it executable and then run it without sh.
2006-01-10T17:30:00.000Z	jenda-zZz	Belboz99	sudo chmod +x "/path/of/file"
2006-01-10T17:32:00.000Z	Belboz99		okay, this one only seems to work with the "./"
2006-01-10T17:33:00.000Z	jenda-zZz	Belboz99	sorry, gotta go (zZz)
