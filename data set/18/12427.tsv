2006-04-22T10:50:00.000Z	Mend		i wanna install realplayer but it is .bin file
2006-04-22T10:51:00.000Z	Warbo	Mend	What kind? If it is an installer use "sh /pathe/to/file"
2006-04-22T10:51:00.000Z	Warbo	Mend	There are packages available, and they will put RealPlayer into FireFox and also get updated automatically
2006-04-22T10:55:00.000Z	Warbo	Mend	Go into a terminal and use "cd /directory/where/bin/file/is"
2006-04-22T10:57:00.000Z	Mend	Warbo	then?
2006-04-22T10:58:00.000Z	Warbo	Mend	OK, I am assuming that you want it installed system wide, so it needs to be run as super user
2006-04-22T10:58:00.000Z	Warbo	Mend	Use "chmod 755 filename.bin"
2006-04-22T10:58:00.000Z	Mend	Warbo	as a root?
2006-04-22T10:58:00.000Z	Warbo	Mend	I will get to that.
2006-04-22T10:59:00.000Z	Warbo	Mend	When it has execute permissions (the chmod thing) then run "sudo ./filename.bin" and put in your regular password
2006-04-22T10:59:00.000Z	Mend	Warbo	will it install it in a necessary directory or should i myself show it where to install?
2006-04-22T11:00:00.000Z	Warbo	Mend	If I recall it asks you. Also you can use the "ls /usr/lib/*mozilla*" command in another terminal to find out where Firefox is (I think it asks you that)
2006-04-22T11:01:00.000Z	Mend	Warbo	1. cd /where/file.bin 2. chmod 755 file.bin 3. sudo /file.bin what then?
2006-04-22T11:04:00.000Z	Warbo	Mend	It is important to have a . before the latst stage "sudo ./file.bin"
2006-04-22T11:04:00.000Z	Mend	Warbo	i didn't get
2006-04-22T11:05:00.000Z	Mend	Warbo	do you mean putting period?
2006-04-22T11:06:00.000Z	Warbo	Mend	Exactly. A "period" (damn americans) means the directory you are in and two periods ".." means the directory above you. You can type "sudo /path/to/file.bin" or just abbrieviate to "sudo ./bin"
