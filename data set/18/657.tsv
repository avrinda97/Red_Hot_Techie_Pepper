2011-11-06T03:24:00.000Z	Guest80021		Johnii: when dose it happen?
2011-11-06T03:26:00.000Z	Jonii	Guest80021	say, I want to resize a program window, or want to focus a program window, or stuff like that
2011-11-06T03:27:00.000Z	Jonii		So I click or drag or whatever, and then I might have to wait up to infinity for the action to actually be performed
2011-11-06T03:28:00.000Z	Guest80021		Johnii: it could be your system... or ubuntu has common issues with sound and other communication devices... what are your pc's specs?
2011-11-06T03:29:00.000Z	Jonii		Acer Aspire 1410
2011-11-06T03:29:00.000Z	Guest80021		 Jonii: ok, gimme a few
2011-11-06T03:31:00.000Z	Guest80021	Jonii	what versiopn of ubuntu?
2011-11-06T03:31:00.000Z	Jonii		11.10
2011-11-06T03:32:00.000Z	Guest80021	Jonii	have you had ubuntu on it 4 a while?
2011-11-06T03:33:00.000Z	Jonii		almost 2 days
2011-11-06T03:34:00.000Z	Guest80021	Jonii	ok, my BEST GUESS is that you have issues with your graphics... my recomendation is to get a ubuntu 10.04 live cd boot it and seee if the problems persist...
2011-11-06T03:34:00.000Z	Guest80021	Jonii	the reason for this is because ubuntu 11.10 is based entirly on 3d graphics with unity
2011-11-06T03:35:00.000Z	Jonii	Guest80021	oh, that's nasty :<
2011-11-06T03:35:00.000Z	Jonii		So I should've used 10.4 instead of 11.10?
2011-11-06T03:36:00.000Z	Guest80021	Jonii	it will test and possibly confirm my susspissions... look for the hardware driver application and see if your graphics card is enabled
2011-11-06T03:37:00.000Z	Jonii		My graphics card is listed on system info as "unknown"
2011-11-06T03:37:00.000Z	Guest80021	Jonii	sorry.. i have to go... ubuntu 10.04 should work then... or you can try to get it working find the card version and go form there
