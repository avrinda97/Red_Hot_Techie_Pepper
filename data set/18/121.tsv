2012-08-25T02:57:00.000Z	fry	Guest50131	is your live cd an ubuntu 12 right?
2012-08-25T03:07:00.000Z	fry	Guest50131	still nothing, sorry, but i keep searching. lauratika: i'm searching for similar situations as yours
2012-08-25T03:08:00.000Z	fry	Guest50131	in the meanwhile you could try burning a new cd or installing ubuntu in a virtual machine mounting the iso and verifying that iso works or does not.
2012-08-25T03:26:00.000Z	fry	Guest50131	 hope you're done! :)
2012-08-25T03:30:00.000Z	fry	Guest50131	hmm, you could try and uncheck them then
2012-08-25T03:31:00.000Z	fry	Guest50131	i think that's irrilevant, because you can download updates later
