2010-01-11T10:52:00.000Z	jerico_		I've concluded using Ubuntu to host a DHCP server is near impossible for a noob. (me)
2010-01-11T10:54:00.000Z	geirha	jerico_	Have you read the Ubuntu Server Guide? It has a chapter on setting up dhcp https://help.ubuntu.com/9.10/serverguide/C/
2010-01-11T10:57:00.000Z	jerico_	geirha	Thanks for the link. Yeah I've read it.  I think my network card just isn't being detected or something.  My /etc/network/interfaces file only had eth0
2010-01-11T10:57:00.000Z	jerico_	geirha	eth0 is being used for my DSL so I wanted to use eth1 for DHCP
2010-01-11T10:57:00.000Z	geirha	jerico_	''ifconfig'' only lists lo and eth0 ?
2010-01-11T10:59:00.000Z	jerico_	geirha	ifconfig lists both
2010-01-11T10:59:00.000Z	geirha	jerico_	eth0 and eth1? Is eth1 wired or wireless?
2010-01-11T11:01:00.000Z	geirha	jerico_	You just need to add a static entry for it in interfaces. https://help.ubuntu.com/9.10/serverguide/C/network-configuration.html
2010-01-11T11:01:00.000Z	jerico_	geirha	yes eth0 and eth1 both are ethernet
2010-01-11T11:08:00.000Z	geirha	jerico_	Yes, or just take up/down the specific device with ''sudo ifup eth1''/''sudo ifdown eth1''
2010-01-11T11:12:00.000Z	geirha	jerico_	Expected if you haven't already brought it up with ifup
2010-01-11T11:14:00.000Z	jerico_	geirha	Failed to bring up eth1.
2010-01-11T11:15:00.000Z	geirha	jerico_	pastebin your interfaces file. ''pastebinit /etc/network/interfaces''
2010-01-11T11:15:00.000Z	geirha	jerico_	pastebinit is not installed by default, so you may need to install it.
2010-01-11T11:18:00.000Z	geirha	jerico_	Replace the network line with a netmask line. ''netmask 255.255.255.0'' for instance.
2010-01-11T11:19:00.000Z	geirha	jerico_	''man interfaces'' explains the syntax of that file btw.
2010-01-11T11:21:00.000Z	jerico_	geirha	You're awesome. that worked.
2010-01-11T11:22:00.000Z	geirha	jerico_	Great! :)
