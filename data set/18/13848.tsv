2005-12-27T17:17:00.000Z	mcphail	jvai	cat /var/log/auth.log | grep ssh will show you any access
2005-12-27T17:20:00.000Z	jvai	mcphail	wouldnt system log show it too?
2005-12-27T17:21:00.000Z	mcphail	jvai	i don't think so, but i'm not sure
2006-07-27T06:02:00.000Z	mcphail	jvai	disable it. It is a legacy of ext2
2006-07-27T06:03:00.000Z	mcphail	jvai	i suspect you will be using ext3
2006-07-27T06:04:00.000Z	mcphail	jvai	check you _aren't_ using ext2 first
2006-07-27T06:05:00.000Z	jvai	mcphail	youre right< system moniters says ext3
2006-07-27T06:06:00.000Z	mcphail	jvai	sudo tune2fs -c 0 /whatever/device/the/filesystem/is
2006-07-27T06:10:00.000Z	mcphail	jvai	what do you mean, "diable ext2"
2006-07-27T06:11:00.000Z	mcphail	jvai	no, disable filesystem checking with the command i posted above
2006-07-27T06:11:00.000Z	mcphail	jvai	sudo tune2fs -c 0 /whatever/device/the/filesystem/is
2006-07-27T06:12:00.000Z	mcphail	jvai	copy n paste and change the bit which needs changed
2006-08-17T14:42:00.000Z	mcphail	jvai	no
2006-08-17T14:42:00.000Z	mcphail	jvai	but it is easily enough done
2006-08-17T14:44:00.000Z	mcphail	jvai	it is actually fairly easy to configure. Just have the man page open to get the timings right.
