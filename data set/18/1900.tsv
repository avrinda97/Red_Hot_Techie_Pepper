2010-10-14T05:01:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Sayo	The entire screen? You can't do anything at all after running mount?

2010-10-14T05:06:00.000Z	Sayo	Jordan_U	this all started after i just umounted /dev/sdb5 10 minutes ago using the -f flag i think, or -l
2010-10-14T05:09:00.000Z	Sayo	Jordan_U	was that enough in that file, or is it missing too much?
2010-10-14T05:10:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Sayo	Reboot then run "sudo fsck -y /dev/sda5"
