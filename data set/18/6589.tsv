2008-04-28T08:58:00.000Z	dudus	Gerinych	looks like there's something wrong with your samba configuration. try to open synaptic, remove and reinstall samba samba-commom smb-client and smbfs
2008-04-28T09:00:00.000Z	Gerinych	dudus	there's no smbfs in the listing
2008-04-28T09:01:00.000Z	dudus		!samba > dudus
2008-04-28T09:09:00.000Z	Gerinych	dudus	now it tells me to enable user sharing
2008-04-28T09:09:00.000Z	dudus	Gerinych	it happened with me also, but after I restart it worked fine
2008-04-28T09:10:00.000Z	dudus	Gerinych	maybe if you just restart samba daemon it will work]
2008-04-28T09:10:00.000Z	Gerinych	dudus	oh ok, i'll try that, thanks if it works
