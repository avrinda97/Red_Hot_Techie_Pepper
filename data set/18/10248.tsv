2006-12-27T09:12:00.000Z	maynar1		Hello all
2006-12-27T09:14:00.000Z	maynar1		Does anyone have time to help with getting remote x applications to work using AMD64 live CD?
2006-12-27T09:14:00.000Z	rukuartic	maynar1	Yup. Install openssh-server, and then use "ssh -x user@host"
2006-12-27T09:15:00.000Z	maynar1	rukuartic	Thanks.  ssh must be installed locally as I'm already logged in to the remote machine.
2006-12-27T09:16:00.000Z	maynar1	rukuartic	I'll try the -x and then read ssh man pages thanks
2006-12-27T09:16:00.000Z	rukuartic	maynar1	:P No problem.
2006-12-27T09:33:00.000Z	rukuartic	maynar1	Tried letting ssh set it?
2006-12-27T09:29:00.000Z	maynar1	rukuartic	Still having problems with X.  Tried -X and -Y.  Triple checked that DISPLAY is set correctly on the remote machine.
2006-12-27T09:29:00.000Z	rukuartic	maynar1	Were you using -X or -x?
2006-12-27T09:29:00.000Z	maynar1	rukuartic	capital X
2006-12-27T09:30:00.000Z	rukuartic	maynar1	I think its supposed to be lowercase.
2006-12-27T09:32:00.000Z	rukuartic	maynar1	I'm wrong on that, hold up...
2006-12-27T09:32:00.000Z	maynar1	rukuartic	Tried both.  I think the problem is that I'm manually setting the DISPLAY
2006-12-27T09:32:00.000Z	maynar1	rukuartic	man pages say let ssh do it :/
2006-12-27T09:33:00.000Z	maynar1	rukuartic	doing it now
2006-12-27T09:37:00.000Z	maynar1	rukuartic	Letting ssh set DISPLAY and using -X (uppercase) did the trick.  Kind of disappointing since I just wrote a script to automatically configure DISPLAY when logging in from a windows machine using PuTTY.
2006-12-27T09:38:00.000Z	maynar1	rukuartic	Thanks for the help.
2006-12-27T09:38:00.000Z	rukuartic	maynar1	No problem :P
