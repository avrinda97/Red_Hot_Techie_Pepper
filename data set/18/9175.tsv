2007-04-29T09:16:00.000Z	mc44	IntrinsicValue	which card do you have?
2007-04-29T09:17:00.000Z	mc44	IntrinsicValue	and what error are you getting?
2007-04-29T09:17:00.000Z	IntrinsicValue	mc44	No error, it just never enables.  It always says "Not in use".
2007-04-29T09:18:00.000Z	mc44	IntrinsicValue	how did you install it?
2007-04-29T09:18:00.000Z	IntrinsicValue	mc44	I didn't do anything - I just launched the Ubuntu 7.04 disk.
2007-04-29T09:18:00.000Z	mc44	IntrinsicValue	well they wont be installed unitl you install them.. you mean the liveCD?
2007-04-29T09:19:00.000Z	mc44	IntrinsicValue	I dont think you can install them on the liveCD, only the installed system
2007-04-29T09:19:00.000Z	IntrinsicValue	mc44	Oh, no I mean after I installed it to the system... (using the disk)
2007-04-29T09:20:00.000Z	mc44	IntrinsicValue	right, what happens when you go into system->admin->restricted drivers
2007-04-29T09:20:00.000Z	IntrinsicValue	mc44	It says "Nvidia accelrated graphics driver"... the enabled box is UNCHECKED.. and Status says "Not in use"
2007-04-29T09:20:00.000Z	mc44	IntrinsicValue	and when you check the box?
2007-04-29T09:21:00.000Z	IntrinsicValue	mc44	how embarrassing
