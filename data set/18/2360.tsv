2010-06-04T11:28:00.000Z	bricky		okay I got my ubuntu working, now I just need to edit the grub file so it recognizes my other operating systems
2010-06-04T11:29:00.000Z	remanifest	bricky	 grub2 (1.9*) should do that automatically
2010-06-04T11:30:00.000Z	bricky	remanifest	my situation is a bit more complicated
2010-06-04T11:31:00.000Z	remanifest	bricky	do you need help, or do you have it?  keep in mind editing grub.cfg isn't recommended because your changes won't "hold" with future updates to grub.
2010-06-04T11:33:00.000Z	bricky	remanifest	I have a C:/win7 partition with a wubi OS on D:/ that arent coming up
2010-06-04T11:33:00.000Z	bricky	remanifest	I actually should ask this in #windows or something
2010-06-04T11:34:00.000Z	remanifest	bricky	Ahh, I've never messed with wubi.
2010-06-04T11:34:00.000Z	bricky	remanifest	no problem I will just edit boot.ini in XP :)
2010-06-04T11:34:00.000Z	remanifest	bricky	I do have win7 on this machine though, and that was automatically picked up by grub2
2010-06-04T11:34:00.000Z	bricky	remanifest	wubi uses the windows bootloader and than boots grub I think
2010-06-04T11:35:00.000Z	remanifest	bricky	"chainloading" is the official term :P
2010-06-04T11:35:00.000Z	bricky	remanifest	sweeet :D
2010-06-04T11:36:00.000Z	bricky	remanifest	I just need to figure out what to put in boot.ini heh
2010-06-04T11:36:00.000Z	remanifest	bricky	messing with windows files (ini) isn't my specialty but I'm sure it can't be *that* hard
2010-06-04T11:38:00.000Z	bricky	remanifest	no I can figure out the windows 7 part thats not too hard, but I need to find out where wubi boots from
2010-06-04T11:41:00.000Z	remanifest	bricky	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WubiGuide#What%20happens%20if%20I%20have%20another%20bootloader? that might give you somewhere to start
2010-06-04T11:42:00.000Z	remanifest	bricky	but you'll feel like the man when you get it
2010-06-04T11:44:00.000Z	bricky	remanifest	yeah it will be most worth it
