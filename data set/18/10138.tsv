2007-01-07T09:57:00.000Z	hjmills	linuxnewuserr	what do you want to install?
2007-01-07T09:58:00.000Z	hjmills	linuxnewuserr	look on the wiki for flash - you cant compile it anyway as its not open source
2007-01-07T12:15:00.000Z	hjmills	linuxnewuserr	what are you installing?
2007-01-07T12:19:00.000Z	hjmills	linuxnewuserr	just log out and log in choosing kde from the sessions list (click sessions and choose kde)
2007-01-07T12:47:00.000Z	hjmills	linuxnewuserr	you could try the open source ati drivers which are getting much better - most display problems can also be fixed quite simply but if you definatly want to remove it you just need to delete the partition, pop in the xp cd, boot from that and at the first screen press "r" to get to the recovery console then run "fixmbr" to reinstall the windows mbr
2007-01-07T12:49:00.000Z	hjmills	linuxnewuserr	it always is at first - i tried it 3 times over a year and uninstalled 3 times as well - i finally settled down with ubuntu and left windows behind a few months later when i realised i wasnt using
2007-01-07T12:49:00.000Z	linuxnewuserr	hjmills	do you have to fix the partition each time you uninstall?
2007-01-07T12:49:00.000Z	hjmills	linuxnewuserr	if you think dos is easy  wait until you see the linux command line!!!
2007-01-07T12:50:00.000Z	hjmills	linuxnewuserr	well u dont want linux so you can get rid of the partition and you want windows to boot so you need to fix the mbr - unfortunatly windows makes it quite hard
2007-01-07T12:53:00.000Z	hjmills	linuxnewuserr	kde vs gnome is a matter of preference but kde is more like windows
2007-01-07T12:54:00.000Z	linuxnewuserr	hjmills	is it not even worth uninstallation? just boot windows ? I don't want to mess with the partition if I can cause problems on it
2007-01-07T12:54:00.000Z	hjmills	linuxnewuserr	then just leave it for when you really hate windows!
2007-01-07T13:09:00.000Z	linuxnewuserr	hjmills	 i won't leave linux because of KDE
