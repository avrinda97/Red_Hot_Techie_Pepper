2011-12-31T14:49:00.000Z	Eartaker		but im I insert a disk it pops up and mounts
2011-12-31T14:50:00.000Z	Eartaker		not for a blank disk though
2011-12-31T14:50:00.000Z	Eartaker		i guess you woulding but im trying to burn a iso
2011-12-31T14:51:00.000Z	Eartaker		I have tried K3b but it dosnt see it
2011-12-31T14:51:00.000Z	Eartaker		and brasero
2011-12-31T14:52:00.000Z	Eartaker		K3b says this:
2011-12-31T14:52:00.000Z	Eartaker		K3b did not find any optical device in your system.
2011-12-31T14:52:00.000Z	Eartaker		Solution: Make sure HAL daemon is running, it is used by K3b for finding devices.
2011-12-31T14:54:00.000Z	Eartaker		my disk drive is also not in "computer"
2011-12-31T14:56:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	Eartaker	It may be a "+RW, -RW", issue; I have two 'burners (a +RW and a -RW) and sometimes a blank will only work (be seen) by one.
2011-12-31T14:56:00.000Z	Eartaker	Sidewinder1	its a cd-r
2011-12-31T14:56:00.000Z	Eartaker		not dvdv
2011-12-31T14:56:00.000Z	Eartaker		dvd
2011-12-31T14:58:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	Eartaker	R stands fro 'read' W stands for 'write', those designations are used on both CDs and DVDs.
2011-12-31T14:58:00.000Z	Sidewinder1		for, even; 'tis early here. :-)
2011-12-31T14:58:00.000Z	Eartaker	Sidewinder1	i know this... its not hardware it works fine in windows
2011-12-31T15:00:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	Eartaker	Actually I think I made a mistake (fancy that), the W means re-writable, sorry.
