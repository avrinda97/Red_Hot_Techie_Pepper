2010-02-15T14:32:00.000Z	vlt		Hello. On Ubuntu 9.10 there seems to be a problem with rdesktop and some [Shift]+[key] combinations. I'm not able to use "/", "=", ">", ";" ... Any idea how to solve this?
2010-02-15T14:32:00.000Z	meborc	vlt	this is due to the different language settings on your windows box... set it to english on both and try then
2010-02-15T14:34:00.000Z	vlt	meborc	I can't set the language stting to English on the server.
2010-02-15T14:35:00.000Z	meborc	vlt	so server has no graphical user interface? just the command line?
2010-02-15T14:39:00.000Z	vlt	meborc	The server has a gui. What could I try to do?
2010-02-15T14:40:00.000Z	meborc	vlt	is that a windows machine you are connecting to?
2010-02-15T14:40:00.000Z	meborc	vlt	if so, just use the language settings...
2010-02-15T14:40:00.000Z	vlt	meborc	Yes, I tried several machines (XP, w2008)
2010-02-15T14:41:00.000Z	vlt	meborc	What does that mean "use the langhuage settings"?
2010-02-15T14:41:00.000Z	vlt	meborc	A "-k" option for rdesktop?
2010-02-15T14:41:00.000Z	meborc	vlt	what layout are you using on your machine? the keyboard layout... english? estonian...?
2010-02-15T14:41:00.000Z	vlt	meborc	de_DE
2010-02-15T14:42:00.000Z	meborc	vlt	ok, try setting the keyboard in the windows also to german... it is in the language settings in the control panel
2010-02-15T14:43:00.000Z	vlt	meborc	The windows machines are set correctly. It works from every other rdesktop client (6.06, 8.04, Debian ...)
2010-02-15T14:43:00.000Z	vlt	meborc	I can't touch the windows settings.
2010-02-15T14:44:00.000Z	meborc	vlt	then this is really weird.. i also had this problem, but i was able to use my "estonian" keyboard, by setting the windows layout to english (default)
2010-02-15T14:44:00.000Z	meborc	vlt	sorry, don't know how to help you
2010-02-15T14:44:00.000Z	vlt	meborc	hmm, thank you ayway
