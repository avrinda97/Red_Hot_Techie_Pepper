2009-03-20T02:15:00.000Z	Carpe|Diem	s0101	ask your question:)
2009-03-20T02:16:00.000Z	Carpe|Diem	s0101	might be a flash problem too
2009-03-20T02:18:00.000Z	Carpe|Diem	s0101	perhaps just reboot your computer than?
2009-03-20T02:18:00.000Z	Carpe|Diem	s0101	something must have been changed than?
2009-03-20T02:19:00.000Z	Carpe|Diem	s0101	what ubuntu? 32 or 64 bit?
2009-03-20T02:20:00.000Z	Carpe|Diem	s0101	open a terminal and type: sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras
2009-03-20T02:23:00.000Z	Carpe|Diem	s0101	no, now go to firefox and uninstall the flash plugin, and reinstall it:)
2009-03-20T02:24:00.000Z	Carpe|Diem	s0101	holdon
2009-03-20T02:25:00.000Z	Carpe|Diem	s0101	open firefox and press: Tools > Add-ons
2009-03-20T02:25:00.000Z	Carpe|Diem	s0101	than click Plugins
2009-03-20T02:26:00.000Z	Carpe|Diem	s0101	than go to google and type: Flash player....go to adobe's website and choose the correct one (Ubuntu 8.04+ .deb package)
2009-03-20T02:26:00.000Z	Carpe|Diem	s0101	disable it
2009-03-20T02:26:00.000Z	Carpe|Diem	s0101	and it doesnt work?
2009-03-20T02:27:00.000Z	Carpe|Diem	s0101	I cant think if any other direct solution than...im sorry
2009-03-20T02:32:00.000Z	Carpe|Diem	s0101	perhaps you can install Opera, see if that browser can play your movies?
