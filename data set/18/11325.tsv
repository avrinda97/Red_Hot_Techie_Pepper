2006-10-03T12:26:00.000Z	stonarmusic		must just be a bad mp3 or something, i renamed and tried it from another directory, and still errors
2006-10-03T12:28:00.000Z	stonarmusic		oh wait, mpeg adts layer III, is not the same as mp3. i wonder if lame will convert it?
2006-10-03T12:30:00.000Z	hastesaver	stonarmusic	does mplayer play it?
2006-10-03T12:32:00.000Z	stonarmusic	hastesaver	- yes, mplayer, totem, etc..
2006-10-03T12:33:00.000Z	hastesaver	stonarmusic	so what gives the errors?
2006-10-03T12:33:00.000Z	stonarmusic	hastesaver	- gnomebaker and serpentine, when i try to burn it to audio cd
2006-10-03T12:34:00.000Z	hastesaver	stonarmusic	you can do "mplayer -ao pcm"
2006-10-03T12:35:00.000Z	stonarmusic	hastesaver	- to convert it?
2006-10-03T12:35:00.000Z	hastesaver	stonarmusic	it will create a .wav file, which you can then burn to CD
2006-10-03T12:35:00.000Z	hastesaver	stonarmusic	you can also, of course, convert it to mp3 with lame, for "future use"... but you don't have to get an mp3, right?
2006-10-03T12:36:00.000Z	stonarmusic	hastesaver	no just something that will burn to audio cd
2006-10-03T12:37:00.000Z	hastesaver	stonarmusic	yeah, the "-ao pcm" (it will create audiodump.wav, watch out if you happen to have a file with the same name :-) is best
2006-10-03T12:38:00.000Z	hastesaver	stonarmusic	what? It can use mp3s but not wav? This is sad :)
2006-10-03T12:39:00.000Z	hastesaver	stonarmusic	ok, go ahead and use lame to make an mp3... or use something better than gnomebaker :)
2006-10-03T12:41:00.000Z	hastesaver	stonarmusic	file a bug!
2006-10-03T12:47:00.000Z	stonarmusic	hastesaver	- does that '-ao pcm' trick work for streams as well?
2006-10-03T13:08:00.000Z	hastesaver	stonarmusic	I still think that if the CD burners can't use .wav files, it's a bug
2006-10-03T13:08:00.000Z	hastesaver	stonarmusic	try k3b or something :)
