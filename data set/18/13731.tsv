2005-12-13T11:35:00.000Z	john_		Hey.
2005-12-13T11:35:00.000Z	john_		I was hoping I could get some advice.
2005-12-13T11:35:00.000Z	john_		My monitor resolution is all screwed up.
2005-12-13T11:35:00.000Z	john_		My monitor is 1280x768.
2005-12-13T11:36:00.000Z	shreevatsa	john_	this just happened, or since install?
2005-12-13T11:36:00.000Z	shreevatsa	john_	I mean, did you install just now, or did you change something?
2005-12-13T11:38:00.000Z	shreevatsa	john_	try this (it worked for me, but mine wasn't widescreen)
2005-12-13T11:38:00.000Z	shreevatsa	john_	try this: sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2005-12-13T11:39:00.000Z	shreevatsa	john_	(or whatever editor you like)
2005-12-13T11:39:00.000Z	shreevatsa	john_	find the section that says Section "Monitor".
2005-12-13T11:39:00.000Z	john_	shreevatsa	: OK, I just get a blank file.
2005-12-13T11:40:00.000Z	shreevatsa	john_	Huh? That isn't supposed to happen...
2005-12-13T11:40:00.000Z	shreevatsa	john_	then I don't know
2005-12-13T11:41:00.000Z	shreevatsa	john_	I had to insert the two lines saying (HorizSync 30-70) and (VertRefresh 50-160)
2005-12-13T11:42:00.000Z	shreevatsa	john_	and then it worked for me. Of course, your numbers are probably different, consult your monitor
2005-12-13T11:47:00.000Z	shreevatsa	john_	great, congratulations
2005-12-13T11:47:00.000Z	shreevatsa	john_	the resolution is right?
2005-12-13T11:52:00.000Z	shreevatsa	john_	there are probably packages for Linux that can replace iTunes, getting one of them will be easier, maybe
