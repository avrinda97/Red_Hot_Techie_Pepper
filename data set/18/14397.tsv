2005-08-06T14:57:00.000Z	Simonth		Is the only differences the number of languague translations or?
2005-08-06T14:57:00.000Z	Amaranth	Simonth	Ubuntu is Debian tuned for the desktop with the latest versions of things.
2005-08-06T14:58:00.000Z	Simonth	Amaranth	But I have heard that the new Linux Debian 3.1 is also good to desktop
2005-08-06T14:59:00.000Z	Amaranth	Simonth	Well, 3.1 has XFree86 4.3 and GNOME 2.8. Ubuntu's latest release has Xorg 6.8 and GNOME 2.10
2005-08-06T15:00:00.000Z	Simonth	Amaranth	Is Xorg better than the normal X? - or something..?
2005-08-06T15:00:00.000Z	Amaranth	Simonth	Xorg is a fork of XFree86, XFree86 is dead
2005-08-06T15:04:00.000Z	Amaranth	Simonth	You put in a CD, choose a couple of simple language and partition choices, wait 20 minutes, and you have a gdm login screen that takes you to a full GNOME desktop that Just Works (most of the time).
2005-08-06T15:06:00.000Z	Simonth	Amaranth	But that is the same thing you do with Linux Debian 3.1?..
2005-08-06T15:06:00.000Z	Amaranth	Simonth	^
2005-08-06T15:08:00.000Z	Amaranth	Simonth	Appearently hoary pretty much has every package sarge has plus more.
2005-08-06T15:13:00.000Z	Amaranth	Simonth	Do not mix Debian and Ubuntu repositories.
2005-08-06T15:13:00.000Z	Simonth	Amaranth	Iam not the best to english...What does "repositories" means?
2005-08-06T15:14:00.000Z	Amaranth	Simonth	places to get packages
2005-08-06T15:16:00.000Z	Simonth	Amaranth	Oh, okay.. But for example the IRC server "asuka" and IRC bouncer "psybnc" I need to compile - are there the correct libraries and compilers in Ubuntu?
2005-08-06T15:16:00.000Z	Amaranth	Simonth	If they're in Debian they're in Ubuntu.
2005-08-06T15:21:00.000Z	Amaranth	Simonth	You want Kubuntu then.
2005-08-06T15:21:00.000Z	Simonth	Amaranth	Yes.. ;)
2005-08-06T15:21:00.000Z	Amaranth	Simonth	Oh, you already know that. :P
