2008-11-28T04:17:00.000Z	Myrtti	gnutron	whut?
2008-11-28T04:26:00.000Z	Myrtti	gnutron	if irssi is an irc client, and irc clients don't need no ircd, why is irssi an exception all of a sudden?
2008-11-28T04:18:00.000Z	gnutron	Myrtti	umm, what, what!?
2008-11-28T04:19:00.000Z	Myrtti	gnutron	irssi requires ircd...
2008-11-28T04:20:00.000Z	gnutron	Myrtti	yeah, to use irssi to chat, you need to connect to a server running a ircd process.
2008-11-28T04:21:00.000Z	Myrtti	gnutron	you didn't need to connect to a server running a ircd process when you came here?
2008-11-28T04:21:00.000Z	gnutron	Myrtti	are you telling me freenode has no ircd? youre wrong
2008-11-28T04:22:00.000Z	Myrtti	gnutron	no, I'm asking you if *other* clients wouldn't need ircd ;-)
2008-11-28T04:22:00.000Z	Myrtti	gnutron	irssi is no exception to other IRC clients
2008-11-28T04:24:00.000Z	gnutron	Myrtti	no, clients need no ircd
2008-11-28T04:24:00.000Z	Myrtti	gnutron	what is irssi then?
2008-11-28T04:25:00.000Z	gnutron	Myrtti	an irc client
2008-11-28T04:25:00.000Z	gnutron	Myrtti	i was a global oper on undernet, i'm pretty certain of this.
2008-11-28T04:27:00.000Z	gnutron	Myrtti	you lost me
2008-11-28T04:27:00.000Z	Myrtti	gnutron	no, you lost me
2008-11-28T04:27:00.000Z	gnutron	Myrtti	i think we agree in any event :)
2008-12-03T05:23:00.000Z	gnutron	Myrtti	http:/irssi.org
2008-12-03T05:23:00.000Z	Myrtti	gnutron	REALLY, I didn't know that website exists. I've only like done the Christmas card on the front page of it...
