2008-02-21T06:33:00.000Z	reikalusikka		does compiz require CPU or GPU or perhaps both?
2008-02-21T06:34:00.000Z	reikalusikka		does a integrated GPU x3100 run all compiz candy?
2008-02-21T06:35:00.000Z	reikalusikka		thanks for the answers, I'm going to buy a laptop with x3100 and just wondering if I can run all the candy <3
2008-02-21T06:36:00.000Z	sdsheeks	reikalusikka	is the video card integrated?
2008-02-21T06:37:00.000Z	sdsheeks	reikalusikka	i was looking at one of those a few weeks ago before i picked up this new laptop, but i didn't want integrated graphics.
2008-02-21T06:37:00.000Z	reikalusikka	sdsheeks	ok, cuz I don't really need GPU
2008-02-21T06:37:00.000Z	sdsheeks	reikalusikka	i game every now and then
2008-02-21T06:38:00.000Z	reikalusikka	sdsheeks	so what does this mean that x3100 is blakclisted?
2008-02-21T06:39:00.000Z	sdsheeks	reikalusikka	i never said that..must have been someone else.
2008-02-21T06:39:00.000Z	reikalusikka	sdsheeks	oh ok, but what does it matter if it's blacklisted. I can't run compiz fusion? what does it matter when I can ignore it? makes no sense :D
2008-02-21T06:40:00.000Z	sdsheeks	reikalusikka	dunno let me scroll up and see who b brought that up.

2008-02-21T06:43:00.000Z	reikalusikka	sdsheeks	 what does it mean in practice if my video card i blacklisted? I
2008-02-21T06:43:00.000Z	sdsheeks	reikalusikka	dunno
2008-02-21T06:43:00.000Z	sdsheeks	reikalusikka	sorry :)
