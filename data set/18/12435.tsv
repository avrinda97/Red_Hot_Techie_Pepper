2006-11-13T16:31:00.000Z	pip		I need help with how to use kget to download a file I really want
2006-11-13T16:32:00.000Z	pip		and all the time I just downloaded a html file other than the real file I want
2006-11-13T16:32:00.000Z	pip		why ?
2006-11-13T16:32:00.000Z	pip		and I used wget and type like this : wget -c <linksite_of_the_file> ,but still got a html file ,
2006-11-13T16:34:00.000Z	MattJ	pip	You could still use wget? :D
2006-11-13T16:35:00.000Z	MattJ	pip	What's the HTML file you get? I guess it redirects somewhere...
2006-11-13T16:36:00.000Z	MattJ	pip	Look for a  redirect in the HTML file
2006-11-13T16:36:00.000Z	MattJ	pip	Somewhere near the top
2006-11-13T16:39:00.000Z	MattJ	pip	Give us the URL, or paste the contents to pastebin
2006-11-13T16:42:00.000Z	MattJ	pip	No, it asks for login
2006-11-13T16:42:00.000Z	pip	MattJ	right !
2006-11-13T16:42:00.000Z	pip	MattJ	so it is classified
2006-11-13T16:43:00.000Z	MattJ	pip	lynx could probably get that, of you supply the login
2006-11-13T16:43:00.000Z	MattJ	pip	If you want it without logging in, I doubt that can be done
2006-11-13T16:44:00.000Z	pip	MattJ	NO,I have an account
2006-11-13T16:44:00.000Z	pip	MattJ	does elink support continute download skill ?
