2008-02-05T04:40:00.000Z	Stepdir		How do I tell what kind of filesystem I have ie ext2,ext3
2008-02-05T04:40:00.000Z	unop__	Stepdir	 file -s /dev/sdXX
2008-02-05T04:42:00.000Z	unop__	Stepdir	replace sdXX there with your own device  :)
2008-02-05T04:43:00.000Z	unop__	Stepdir	you can also use this command (albeit a little unreliable)  - sudo fdisk -l
2008-02-05T04:47:00.000Z	Stepdir	unop__	I get  Linux rev 1.0 ext3 filesystem data (needs journal recovery) - What is the needs journal recovery about?
2008-02-05T04:48:00.000Z	unop__	Stepdir	it usually means the ext3 journal is corrupt and needs repairing
2008-02-05T04:51:00.000Z	unop__	Stepdir	i dont have an ext3 filesystem to test this on - but this command should probably do the trick - sudo tune2fs -f -j /dev/sdXX
2008-02-05T04:55:00.000Z	Stepdir	unop__	It say it already has a journal. I'm guessing that it is not a problem. I was asking because I just compiled a kernel, and it said it could not mount the filesystem.
2008-02-05T04:55:00.000Z	unop__	Stepdir	if you just compiled a kernel, it's likely that you didn't include ext3 support
2008-02-05T04:56:00.000Z	unop__	Stepdir	although, it's hard to say what the problem is without a full error report
2008-02-05T04:57:00.000Z	Stepdir	unop__	I checked that. It is compiled in. :( I'm at a loss. There was not much. Just that on boot. didn't make it very far.
2008-02-05T04:59:00.000Z	Stepdir	unop__	I was trying to compile a non initrd kernel. I may be related to that.
2008-02-05T04:59:00.000Z	unop__	Stepdir	it's also probable that ext2 support was included but not ext3 -- could explain the journalling issues
2008-02-05T05:00:00.000Z	Stepdir	unop__	I checked that too. I said no to ext2.
2008-02-05T05:01:00.000Z	unop__	Stepdir	ahh, errm, IIRC ext3 is just ext2 with journalling included -- that explains why
2008-02-05T05:02:00.000Z	Stepdir	unop__	funny because it identify's it as ext2 first line at boot. :-/
2008-02-05T05:03:00.000Z	unop__	Stepdir	i'm not sure why that is - but i would include both ext2 and ext3 support into the kernel
2008-02-05T05:03:00.000Z	Stepdir	unop__	I think I will try that. Thanks for the help.
