2005-08-01T07:31:00.000Z	mucknert		Is anyone in here able or willing to give me some hints on cups in Ubuntu? I'm kinda stuck with a problem there.
2005-08-01T07:33:00.000Z	mucknert		Anyway..
2005-08-01T07:35:00.000Z	ZincX	mucknert	how do i unmount ?
2005-08-01T07:35:00.000Z	mucknert	ZincX	umount /path/of/mountpoint
2005-08-01T07:36:00.000Z	mucknert	ZincX	Usually not.
2005-08-01T07:37:00.000Z	mucknert	ZincX	Yes.
2005-08-01T07:38:00.000Z	mucknert	ZincX	You can work around that by putting the device and the mountpoint into /etc/fstab.
2005-08-01T07:39:00.000Z	mucknert	ZincX	It's a file you edit. Look at the syntax and you understand what I mean.
2005-08-01T07:44:00.000Z	ZincX	mucknert	.. how do i need to edit this file ?
2005-08-01T07:44:00.000Z	mucknert	ZincX	"How"? Just with a normal editor. Vim, Nano, Kate..
2005-08-01T07:47:00.000Z	ZincX	mucknert	what is pass ?
2005-08-01T07:48:00.000Z	mucknert	ZincX	For most peripheral stuff, you can use 0
2005-08-01T07:49:00.000Z	mucknert	ZincX	Yes.
2005-08-01T07:51:00.000Z	ZincX	mucknert	i save this and then ?
2005-08-01T07:51:00.000Z	mucknert	ZincX	After a reboot (reparsing fstab), you will be able to mount this medium without being root.
2005-08-01T07:51:00.000Z	mucknert	ZincX	If you did it right, of course. :)
2005-08-01T07:52:00.000Z	ZincX	mucknert	k ... lemme try
