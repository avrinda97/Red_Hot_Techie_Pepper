2006-10-13T16:30:00.000Z	frying_fish		This is going to sound random, but does anyone else use a 1920x1200 monitor and perhaps have a decent 1920x1200 gdm theme?
2006-10-13T16:32:00.000Z	frying_fish		b) your virus scanner is most likely showing a false positive.
2006-10-13T16:33:00.000Z	frying_fish		more than likely, if you are scanning a .deb file.
2006-10-13T16:34:00.000Z	frying_fish		then vnc localhost:5000
2006-10-13T16:35:00.000Z	frying_fish		I didn't say "never" I said highly unlikely
2006-10-13T16:36:00.000Z	frying_fish		and that a w32 virus cannot infect a linux system
2006-10-13T16:36:00.000Z	frying_fish		and don't tend to tunnel vnc, I just use ssh and the commandline, since I am perfectly happy with it.
2006-10-13T16:37:00.000Z	frying_fish		the day the command line is taken away from ubuntu is the day I go to something else.
2006-10-13T16:39:00.000Z	frying_fish		gparted can deal with ntfs.
2006-10-13T16:40:00.000Z	Kismet	frying_fish	LjL: Will these tools also copy the MBR? I'm trying to migrate to a larger boot drive
2006-10-13T16:40:00.000Z	frying_fish	Kismet	why do you need to copy the MBR, you could always just reinstall grub on the new drives MBR
2006-10-13T16:41:00.000Z	Kismet	frying_fish	guess i don't know how to install GRUB outside of doing a full Linux Install
2006-10-13T16:41:00.000Z	frying_fish	Kismet	!grub
2006-10-13T16:41:00.000Z	frying_fish		!grub
2006-10-13T16:41:00.000Z	frying_fish	Kismet	just follow those instructions from ubotu
2006-10-13T16:41:00.000Z	frying_fish		its pretty simple.
2006-10-13T16:41:00.000Z	Kismet	frying_fish	thanks very much!
2006-10-13T16:42:00.000Z	frying_fish	Kismet	you're welcome
