2007-01-07T06:32:00.000Z	groggy	jakob	You know about the LIRC daemon, right?
2007-01-07T06:32:00.000Z	jakob	groggy	sorry no.
2007-01-07T06:32:00.000Z	groggy	jakob	You need to start lircd in the background.
2007-01-07T06:32:00.000Z	groggy	jakob	What kind of remote control are you using?
2007-01-07T06:33:00.000Z	groggy	jakob	Have you configured LIRC to find it?
2007-01-07T06:34:00.000Z	groggy	jakob	Actually, I'm a little confused.  I don't have a 'lirc' executable on my machine.
2007-01-07T06:34:00.000Z	groggy	jakob	... and certainly not three.
2007-01-07T06:34:00.000Z	groggy	jakob	Ah.
2007-01-07T06:36:00.000Z	groggy	jakob	Clearly you have something if you can get it to run at all.
2007-01-07T06:37:00.000Z	jakob	groggy	I can easily get it to run, it just annoys me I have to do a make install every time I've rebooted.
2007-01-07T06:37:00.000Z	groggy	jakob	Anyway, I haven't had LIRC running on Ubuntu, so maybe there's soemthing special there.
2007-01-07T06:37:00.000Z	groggy	jakob	I don't have any problems on Debian, though.
2007-01-07T06:37:00.000Z	groggy	jakob	Is it running right now?
2007-01-07T06:38:00.000Z	groggy	jakob	No, don't.
2007-01-07T06:38:00.000Z	groggy	jakob	Try this:
2007-01-07T06:39:00.000Z	groggy	jakob	Then try rynning lircd again.
2007-01-07T06:41:00.000Z	groggy	jakob	OK, looks like we have the wrong major number.
2007-01-07T06:53:00.000Z	jakob	groggy	it hit me that it's now able to find the /dev/lirc it's just not able to open it. Is there something I can do in that case?
