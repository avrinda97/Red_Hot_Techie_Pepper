2006-07-25T10:54:00.000Z	fuoco		should i manually configure xorg.conf in ubuntu ?
2006-07-25T10:55:00.000Z	oskude	fuoco	i do it manually allways... but you dont have to
2006-07-25T10:55:00.000Z	fuoco	oskude	i don't have 3d support out of the box...
2006-07-25T10:55:00.000Z	oskude	fuoco	whats your card ?
2006-07-25T10:55:00.000Z	fuoco	oskude	r300
2006-07-25T10:56:00.000Z	oskude	fuoco	hmm, radeon should work (as i heard) out of the box... but r300 has experimental 3d hw accel
2006-07-25T10:56:00.000Z	fuoco	oskude	it worked for me for a very long time in other distros
2006-07-25T10:57:00.000Z	oskude	fuoco	sorry im bad with radeon driver, i allways used fglrx driver :/
2006-07-25T10:58:00.000Z	fuoco	oskude	i just wonder if i should configure it manually or expect ubuntu to do it ?
2006-07-25T10:58:00.000Z	oskude	fuoco	i just apt-get installed the fglrx driver and changed that as driver in xorg.conf
2006-07-25T11:09:00.000Z	oskude	fuoco	transcode is powerfull, but allso little complicated (if you dont know about video)
2006-07-25T11:10:00.000Z	fuoco	oskude	yeah that why i thought of a gui... transcode is different than mancoder ?
2006-07-25T11:11:00.000Z	oskude	fuoco	dunno about mencoder, but i remember seeing a transcode gui, sec...
2006-07-25T11:12:00.000Z	oskude	fuoco	huh... was for something else ;)
2006-10-05T10:33:00.000Z	oskude	fuoco	3 partitions ?
2006-10-05T10:34:00.000Z	fuoco	oskude	at least
2006-10-05T10:34:00.000Z	oskude	fuoco	you dont _need_ 3 partitions, just one for / and one for swap!
2006-10-05T10:34:00.000Z	fuoco	oskude	you're right for i386, yeah. other's might need a seperate /boot
