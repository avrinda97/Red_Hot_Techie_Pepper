2008-01-04T08:49:00.000Z	XiXaQ		to share files and folders in Windows XP, you can right-click what you want to share, select sharing, type a description and a password, and you're set. In Ubuntu, it seems necessary to read books in order to accomplish the same thing.. How is this possible?
2008-01-04T08:50:00.000Z	PirateHead	XiXaQ	Nah, it's actually pretty easy. Let me walk you through the process. (2 steps, I think)
2008-01-04T08:50:00.000Z	PirateHead	XiXaQ	first, go to System -> Administration -> Shared Folders
2008-01-04T08:51:00.000Z	XiXaQ	PirateHead	I've done that.
2008-01-04T08:51:00.000Z	PirateHead	XiXaQ	It might tell you that support for shared folders isn't installed. Let it install the packages for you.
2008-01-04T08:52:00.000Z	XiXaQ	PirateHead	I've done that too.
2008-01-04T08:52:00.000Z	PirateHead	XiXaQ	And you've added the folders you want to share to the list in shared folders?
2008-01-04T08:52:00.000Z	XiXaQ	PirateHead	yes.
2008-01-04T08:52:00.000Z	PirateHead	XiXaQ	In that case, it sounds like something is wrong. That same procedure works fine for me.
2008-01-04T08:53:00.000Z	XiXaQ	PirateHead	you left out configuring /etc/samba/smb.conf. Since the default is to not allow that kind of sharing, it's necessary.
2008-01-04T08:54:00.000Z	PirateHead	XiXaQ	Hmm, I don't remember having to mess with Samba's configuration to get it to work.
2008-01-04T08:57:00.000Z	PirateHead	XiXaQ	Perhaps you do need to read a book to get it working, then. :-(
2008-01-04T08:59:00.000Z	PirateHead	XiXaQ	you've got that right. It should just work, the way Windows users are used to.
2008-01-04T09:05:00.000Z	XiXaQ	PirateHead	do you know how to make a password protected share with security = share?
2008-01-04T09:05:00.000Z	PirateHead	XiXaQ	use NFS?
2008-01-04T09:06:00.000Z	XiXaQ	PirateHead	as I understand it, it can't be installed on xp home since it requires sfu?
2008-01-04T09:06:00.000Z	PirateHead	XiXaQ	Hmm, don't know. Is there not a free software replacement?
2008-01-04T09:07:00.000Z	XiXaQ	PirateHead	I seriously doubt that.
