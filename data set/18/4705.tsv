2009-08-13T19:40:00.000Z	joakimk		I've just installed XP on my laptop, formatting the entire HD as NTFS. Now I want to use the Ubuntu 9 installer to set up a dual boot :) I'm following this guide, http://apcmag.com/how_to_dual_boot_windows_xp_and_linux_xp_installed_first.htm Will the Ubuntu installer create all necessary "sub-partitions" for me, like / and /home? I just want to say, "ubuntu, take half the disk." But what about swap, do I need that, and how do I do that?
2009-08-13T19:42:00.000Z	mzz	joakimk	they can't use each other's swap conveniently. The "guided" partitioner should do something reasonable though.
2009-08-13T19:42:00.000Z	joakimk	mzz	OK, because the last time I did this, I made an explicit 15GB slice with FAT32 formatting, so both could use it
2009-08-13T19:43:00.000Z	mzz	joakimk	with ntfs-3g linux is pretty good at both reading and writing ntfs now, so I'd prefer that filesystem type for a shared partition these days
2009-08-13T19:44:00.000Z	mzz	joakimk	(which means you probably won't need a dedicated shared partition, you can just read/write your main windows partition from ubuntu)
2009-08-13T19:44:00.000Z	joakimk	mzz	But the other way, then? Xp can't read the Ubuntu part?
2009-08-13T19:45:00.000Z	mzz	joakimk	not conveniently, no.
2009-08-13T19:45:00.000Z	mzz	joakimk	(it *is* possible, although I'm not sure if it'll handle ext4 yet)
2009-08-13T19:46:00.000Z	mzz	joakimk	yes, but you'd have to partition manually. Why do you need this though?
2009-08-13T19:46:00.000Z	joakimk	mzz	To move stuff back&forth between XP and Ubuntu
2009-08-13T19:47:00.000Z	mzz	joakimk	again: ubuntu will happily both read from and write to your main windows xp partition ("c:" in windows)
2009-08-13T19:47:00.000Z	mzz	joakimk	why do you want a separate partition?
2009-08-13T19:47:00.000Z	joakimk	mzz	hehe, yes, but will XP be able to read the ubuntu partition, is my question :)
2009-08-13T19:48:00.000Z	mzz	joakimk	no, but I don't see why that means you'd need a separate partition to share data. Just use a directory in your main windows partition.
2009-08-13T19:48:00.000Z	joakimk	mzz	ahh! I see
2009-08-13T19:50:00.000Z	joakimk	mzz	OK, just to be sure: Will the U installer ask me what format I want for the partition? And what should I use? I'm thinking ext3
2009-08-13T19:51:00.000Z	mzz	joakimk	if you use the guided partition it'll do something reasonable (iirc it'll ask you how much to shrink the windows partition, then set up an ext3 root and some swap, but it's been ages since I used that thing)
2009-08-13T19:51:00.000Z	mzz	joakimk	you can also do the partitioning by hand if you prefer, it's fairly self-explainatory (sp?)
