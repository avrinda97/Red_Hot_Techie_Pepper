2008-01-03T08:39:00.000Z	jagerman	mneptok	Yes
2008-01-03T08:35:00.000Z	mneptok	jagerman	is this an add-in, or a mobo decision?
2008-01-03T08:37:00.000Z	jagerman	mneptok	A motherboard decision.
2008-01-03T08:37:00.000Z	mneptok	jagerman	Intel
2008-01-03T08:37:00.000Z	mneptok	jagerman	Intel graphics, by far, are your best bet in current incarnations of the Linux kernel.
2008-01-03T08:38:00.000Z	jagerman	mneptok	I can't find any Intel boards with DVI, though.
2008-01-03T08:38:00.000Z	mneptok	jagerman	you in the US?
2008-01-03T08:38:00.000Z	mneptok	jagerman	oh, nice, hiya from Montreal.
2008-01-03T08:39:00.000Z	mneptok	jagerman	you loking at a Core2Duo board?
2008-01-03T08:39:00.000Z	mneptok	jagerman	sec.
2008-01-03T08:39:00.000Z	jagerman	mneptok	One that supports 1333 bus
2008-01-03T08:41:00.000Z	jagerman	mneptok	So far, the best choice looks like a nvidia 1750/630i board, but I'd be happier indeed with an Intel chipset.
2008-01-03T08:42:00.000Z	mneptok	jagerman	looks like TigerDirect has no Intel DVI boards :(
2008-01-03T08:43:00.000Z	mneptok	jagerman	and, sadly, you can only get Intel grfx onboard
2008-01-03T08:44:00.000Z	jagerman	mneptok	I found *one* on NCIX, for an older chipset.  They also sell an adaptor that hooks into the PCIex slot and gives you DVI output, but it costs almost $30, and a whole discrete cheapo nvidia card is barely any more.
2008-01-03T08:57:00.000Z	jagerman	mneptok	It's an "ADD2" card you have to add to get DVI.  How lame. :(
2008-01-03T08:58:00.000Z	mneptok	jagerman	that's pathetic.
2008-01-03T08:59:00.000Z	mneptok	jagerman	let's go burn Intel down.
