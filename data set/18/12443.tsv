2010-05-03T07:16:00.000Z	Plugh		Nice job on Ubuntu 10.04. I just upgraded 9.10 to 10.04 on my laptop and it was very easy. I only had 2 minor things to fix after it was done, and one package to reinstall (and possibly the accelerated video drivers to be installed).
2010-05-03T07:17:00.000Z	Plugh		However, I have found one big problem. If I close the laptop to put the machine to sleep for a bit, when I re-open the lid, the laptop screen remains black and it seems as if the machine may still be sleeping. Anyone heard reports of problems with sleep/wakeup on laptops in 10.04?
2010-05-03T07:18:00.000Z	clausen	Plugh	does hibernate work?
2010-05-03T07:19:00.000Z	Plugh	clausen	I haven't gone used the menus to put the machine to sleep/hibernate. I'll try that.
2010-05-03T08:12:00.000Z	clausen	Plugh	huh?
2010-05-03T08:12:00.000Z	clausen	Plugh	it automatically generates stuff, if you like
2010-05-03T08:12:00.000Z	clausen	Plugh	but you can edit grub.cfg manually if you want
2010-05-03T08:14:00.000Z	clausen	Plugh	I'm surprised to hear you say that
2010-05-03T08:14:00.000Z	clausen	Plugh	I think it's simpler
2010-05-03T08:14:00.000Z	clausen	Plugh	is there anything in particular they could make simpler?
2010-05-03T08:14:00.000Z	clausen	Plugh	or anything in particular that scares you about it?
2010-05-03T08:14:00.000Z	Plugh	clausen	It was something I read that said if you alter a .cfg(?) file in grub 2, you need to run a command have the file you modified be used to create/update some other file used during grub2 's boot
2010-05-03T08:15:00.000Z	clausen	Plugh	that is not really correct
2010-05-03T08:15:00.000Z	clausen	Plugh	unless you need to add new file systems or whatever into the grub kernel
2010-05-03T08:15:00.000Z	clausen	Plugh	like, the new grub supports many different filesystems, etc.
2010-05-03T08:15:00.000Z	Plugh	clausen	the new config file. My grub.conf file has 4 lines per boot entry. Grub2 had lots more lines of stuff in it.
2010-05-03T08:16:00.000Z	clausen	Plugh	huh?
2010-05-03T08:16:00.000Z	clausen	Plugh	grub2 is also 4 lines per entry
