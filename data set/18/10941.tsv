2006-10-11T10:16:00.000Z	avagant		Basically it skips anything with a ## in front of it.
2006-10-11T10:16:00.000Z	avagant		What I think is happening is you don't have the commented, therefore you can't get packages.
2006-10-11T10:17:00.000Z	avagant		Ok now run sudo apt-get update
2006-10-11T10:17:00.000Z	avagant		and try the java thing again. I swear it works because i just did it like 3 hours ago.
2006-10-11T10:17:00.000Z	avagant		I just had to fresh install everything.
2006-10-11T10:18:00.000Z	avagant		I know I"m probably the last person to dish out advice on anything but...
2006-10-11T10:19:00.000Z	avagant		blue hue?
2006-10-11T10:19:00.000Z	avagant		Did it happen before you installed the codecs?
2006-10-11T10:19:00.000Z	avagant		Ok do the java package again.
2006-10-11T10:19:00.000Z	johnnyg	avagant	before I installed the codecs I couldn't play videos of certain formats.
2006-10-11T10:20:00.000Z	avagant	johnnyg	but i mean was the blue hue there?
2006-10-11T10:20:00.000Z	johnnyg	avagant	no
