2010-06-18T05:25:00.000Z	ede		got it
2010-06-18T05:25:00.000Z	ede		just need to know what it's called that all
2010-06-18T05:27:00.000Z	AAA	ede	 what are you looking for? "<ede> just need to know what it's called that all"
2010-06-18T11:52:00.000Z	AAA	ede	 log out and back in to X may fix it. but something made it freeze in the first place..
2010-06-18T11:54:00.000Z	AAA	ede	 one way is to do $ service dbus restart
2010-06-18T11:54:00.000Z	AAA	ede	 as sudo
2010-06-18T11:54:00.000Z	AAA	ede	 alt-f1
2010-06-18T11:54:00.000Z	AAA	ede	 sorry. ctrl-alt-f1
2010-06-18T11:55:00.000Z	AAA	ede	 if you can log into that VT then $ /etc/init.d/gdm restart
2010-06-18T11:55:00.000Z	AAA	ede	 or $ service gdm restart
2010-06-18T12:01:00.000Z	AAA	ede	 that is a VT. most *nix system have 6 or 7. if you ctrl-alt-f8, or maybe f7... you'll find the VT that has your X or as you like to say, not old school setup ;)
2010-06-18T12:02:00.000Z	AAA	ede	 dude. everyone has a first day :)
