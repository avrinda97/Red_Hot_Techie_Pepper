2007-12-12T23:33:00.000Z	Ashfire908		how do i save a file in unix/linux format
2007-12-12T23:33:00.000Z	Ashfire908		yes
2007-12-12T23:33:00.000Z	debaser	Ashfire908	you mean a text file?
2007-12-12T23:34:00.000Z	Ashfire908	debaser	"O" or "o"
2007-12-12T23:34:00.000Z	debaser	Ashfire908	that's case insensitive
2007-12-12T23:35:00.000Z	debaser	Ashfire908	even sed will do it with no problem
2007-12-12T23:37:00.000Z	Ashfire908	debaser	i want to save it in unix format, not dos
2007-12-12T23:37:00.000Z	debaser	Ashfire908	nano should autoconvert it, but you can use a single and elegant sed command to easily do it
2007-12-12T23:38:00.000Z	Ashfire908	debaser	and that is?
2007-12-12T23:39:00.000Z	debaser	Ashfire908	sed is a powerful command line program which works with regular expressions (it is technically a programming language)
2007-12-12T23:39:00.000Z	debaser	Ashfire908	its usually used to filter output or replace things which appear repeteadly in a file, like a DOS line break for a UNIX line break
2007-12-12T23:40:00.000Z	Ashfire908	debaser	...simple way: what's M-D stand for?
2007-12-12T23:41:00.000Z	debaser	Ashfire908	dunno
2007-12-12T23:41:00.000Z	debaser	Ashfire908	wait a minute
2007-12-12T23:44:00.000Z	debaser	Ashfire908	http://sed.sourceforge.net/sed1line.txt there you go
2007-12-12T23:45:00.000Z	Ashfire908	debaser	never mind. i used alt-D at save and it saved it in unix format
2007-12-12T23:45:00.000Z	debaser	Ashfire908	ok
2007-12-12T23:46:00.000Z	debaser	Ashfire908	but save that file because you might use it in a case like this
