2010-08-13T05:39:00.000Z	thune3	psilo2	that they are identical make/manufacturer is weird. could you pastebin the fdisk -l output ?
2010-08-13T05:39:00.000Z	psilo2	thune3	sure just a sec
2010-08-13T05:40:00.000Z	psilo2	thune3	Izinucs: http://pastie.org/1089511 [+]    Note that there is a partition at the moment, but the stated size was the same even before that partition existed.
2010-08-13T05:42:00.000Z	thune3	psilo2	i was hoping to see both of them
2010-08-13T05:42:00.000Z	psilo2	thune3	okay, I'll connect the other, jst a sec.

2010-08-13T05:45:00.000Z	psilo2	thune3	as you can see, that one's happy :)   Also, I have another pair of disks, different brand, but they are also exactly 32017047552 bytes.
2010-08-13T05:47:00.000Z	psilo2	thune3	is there any point in zeroing the entire device?
2010-08-13T05:50:00.000Z	thune3	psilo2	i can't see a reason. if there was a hidden area, i think it would show up as a seperate device. So I can't see how zeroing would do anything useful.
2010-08-13T05:54:00.000Z	thune3	psilo2	i'm not clear about the "raid" part, and if you have a hardware raid controller that might be doing something to cause this. otherwise this falls into a "contact the manufacturer" recommendation.
2010-08-13T05:54:00.000Z	psilo2	thune3	nope, the raid is just a partition type.
2010-08-13T05:54:00.000Z	psilo2	thune3	yeah, I will have to return the drive and tell them the serial number of the good one, and demand an exact match.
2010-08-13T05:55:00.000Z	psilo2	thune3	unfortunately they've *really* inconvenienced my employer by rounding the size.
2010-08-13T05:56:00.000Z	thune3	psilo2	of course they might say that both drives exceed "spec" in terms of size, and that anything over X, was just unused fail/redundancy that that you get as bonus.
2010-08-13T06:07:00.000Z	psilo2	thune3	Fry's is going to let me open drives and plug them in until one has the right size :)
2010-08-13T06:11:00.000Z	thune3	psilo2	that'll work
2010-08-13T06:12:00.000Z	psilo2	thune3	to be safe I'll buy two identical models, as well.  I will take the bunk patriot drive and use it as a voodoo doll against the patriot.com mailserver drives
2010-08-25T06:21:00.000Z	psilo2	thune3	oh good point.  It may have a `
