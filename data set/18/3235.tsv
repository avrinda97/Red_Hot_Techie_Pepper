2009-11-10T08:20:00.000Z	Ded1cated	flan_suse	his question is interessting anyway. when you install windows on a second harddisk, its sure it writes mbr on first disk (or boot will fail)
2009-11-10T08:22:00.000Z	flan_suse	Ded1cated	Oh, what I do is UNPLUG ALL OTHER DISKS when installing Windows.
2009-11-10T08:22:00.000Z	Ded1cated	flan_suse	his setup is that currently disc1 is holding the mbr to boot disk2
2009-11-10T08:22:00.000Z	flan_suse	Ded1cated	I HATE the Windows installer. It's so primitive!
2009-11-10T08:23:00.000Z	flan_suse	Ded1cated	He won't have to worry if he unplugs all other disks when installing Windows. The hard drive will have a fresh MBR for Windows, and the OTHER hard drive will be unaffected.
2009-11-10T08:24:00.000Z	Ded1cated	flan_suse	its that primitive that you know what it does :)
2009-11-10T08:24:00.000Z	Ded1cated	flan_suse	isnt his windows already installed?
2009-11-10T08:26:00.000Z	Ded1cated	flan_suse	instead of pressing f8 you could do a 2 liner in grub to "swap" the harddisks, so your windows hd appears as first when selected just as side note)
2009-11-10T08:28:00.000Z	flan_suse	Ded1cated	There's probably other workarounds he can do too, but I find it pointless in this day and age, especially with the features motherboards have now, and the cheap prices of hard drives.
2009-11-10T08:30:00.000Z	Ded1cated	flan_suse	well it fits your needs maybe, but grub has more features, like remember the last used os, and im sure you dont need that much, others do :)
2009-11-10T08:30:00.000Z	flan_suse	Ded1cated	You kind of see what I mean? I think "dual-booting" between Windows and Linux on the same drive is out-dated. Drives are cheap, motherboards are smart. Not worth the hassle, really.
2009-11-10T08:31:00.000Z	flan_suse	Ded1cated	I understand. I'm just more "to-the-point", that's all.
2009-11-10T08:31:00.000Z	flan_suse	Ded1cated	And look at what happens when you resize an NTFS partition, Windows has a fit!
2009-11-10T08:32:00.000Z	Ded1cated	flan_suse	my "2 os on one disk" re-install is 2 weeks old, its absolutely not outdated. before it wasnt diffrent. switched from a raptor to a ssd
2009-11-10T08:33:00.000Z	flan_suse	Ded1cated	Hey, whatever works for each person. But we probably shouldn't go on a tangent in this channel. greezmunkey, enjoy Chromium, by the way! And I'm off to bed. Night.
2009-11-10T08:33:00.000Z	Ded1cated	flan_suse	according to ntfs resize, you always need a clean windows boot before (since last ntfs modification) and i personally never had problems with ntfs resize under linux
2009-11-10T08:33:00.000Z	Ded1cated	flan_suse	sure, just wanted to show that other peops have completely other views :)
