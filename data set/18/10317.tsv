2006-12-19T07:30:00.000Z	Falstius	Zoss	installing windows overwrote the boot partition.  If you haven't saved anything in ubuntu yet, the easiest thing to do is reinstall ubuntu.  There are less drastic ways but they're cryptic.
2006-12-19T07:30:00.000Z	Zoss	Falstius	I partioned my drive to use Ubuntu and windows
2006-12-19T07:31:00.000Z	Falstius	Zoss	sorry, boot record not partition.  The boot record is the first kilobyte or so of the disk.  You need to fix that boot record, and the simplest way is to reinstall ubuntu.
2006-12-19T07:32:00.000Z	Zoss	Falstius	Ok..So i'll just reinstall Ubuntu, then how do I boot to it?
2006-12-19T07:33:00.000Z	Zoss		chroot?
2006-12-19T07:33:00.000Z	Zoss		I am new to linux..
2006-12-19T07:33:00.000Z	Zoss		=.=
2006-12-19T07:33:00.000Z	Falstius	Zoss	when you install ubuntu, it will install the grub "boot loader" which will give you a chose of booting windows or linux.  There will be a message while the machine is booting telling you what to do.
