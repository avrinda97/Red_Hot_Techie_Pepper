2007-12-05T15:06:00.000Z	cheetahfr		i just want to play mp3's, is it really this hard just to get xmms to work?
2007-12-05T15:06:00.000Z	cheetahfr		not at present.
2007-12-05T15:07:00.000Z	cheetahfr		yes, i will get the internet. in time.
2007-12-05T15:07:00.000Z	cheetahfr		it does not recognise my wireless, so i figured i'd play a few tunes as this computer doesn't haqve a soundcard...
2007-12-05T15:08:00.000Z	cheetahfr		if i take the wireless otu of this computer, i lose my ability to use the internet, and ubuntu doesn't recognise my device
2007-12-05T15:09:00.000Z	cheetahfr		alright. i'll just give up and play audio cd's.
2007-12-05T15:09:00.000Z	cheetahfr		incidently, is it easy to get ubuntu to recognise a usb wireless device?
2007-12-05T15:09:00.000Z	cheetahfr		yes, steve. but i don't have internet available.
2007-12-05T15:09:00.000Z	cheetahfr		i have xmms downloaded as a tar and sitting on the ubuntu desktop.
2007-12-05T15:09:00.000Z	cheetahfr		apparently it's too hard to install without the internet.
2007-12-05T15:10:00.000Z	ikonia	cheetahfr	the bottom line is the codecs needed are online only
2007-12-05T15:10:00.000Z	ikonia	cheetahfr	ok, so get the correct packages online and install them from a cd
2007-12-05T15:24:00.000Z	ikonia	cheetahfr	thats a library
2007-12-05T15:24:00.000Z	ikonia	cheetahfr	that libary is part oa package though
2007-12-05T15:24:00.000Z	ikonia	cheetahfr	"of a package" that should read
2007-12-05T15:24:00.000Z	ikonia	cheetahfr	the package is glib
2007-12-05T15:39:00.000Z	ikonia	cheetahfr	you have been aked 2 times
2007-12-05T15:39:00.000Z	ikonia	cheetahfr	there is no need for that language
