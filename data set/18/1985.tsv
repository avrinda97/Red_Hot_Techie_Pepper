2010-09-21T19:20:00.000Z	Pici	meitantei	You need to ask a real question first.
2010-09-21T19:22:00.000Z	Pici	meitantei	Knows how to *what*? You haven't asked a real question about stardict yet.
2010-09-21T19:22:00.000Z	Pici	meitantei	sudo apt-get install stardict-tools
2010-09-21T19:23:00.000Z	Pici	meitantei	Did you get an error?
2010-09-21T19:24:00.000Z	Pici	meitantei	They are all command line tools.
2010-09-21T19:25:00.000Z	Pici	meitantei	To start, try: bgl2txt --help
2010-09-21T19:26:00.000Z	Pici	meitantei	Try it
2010-09-21T19:27:00.000Z	Pici	meitantei	Try: /usr/lib/stardict-tools/bgl2txt --help
2010-09-21T19:30:00.000Z	Pici	meitantei	I don't know how to use it, I'm just guessing.  But thats a good place to start.
2010-09-21T19:36:00.000Z	Pici	meitantei	I told you, I don't know how to use the program.  --help usually will provide a help page, but in this case it doesn't look to be helping.
