2007-03-04T14:44:00.000Z	teeL	billymeter	Nope, its not in the history..
2007-03-04T14:44:00.000Z	billymeter	teeL	Then the transaction most likely didn't go through. Try registering it again.
2007-03-04T14:45:00.000Z	teeL	billymeter	Ok =)
2007-03-04T14:51:00.000Z	teeL	billymeter	Should i register as Private or Public?
2007-03-04T14:51:00.000Z	billymeter	teeL	The domain name? Is it refering to the Whois information?
2007-03-04T14:52:00.000Z	teeL	billymeter	I think its the whois information. But it just says: Private or Public
2007-03-04T14:53:00.000Z	billymeter	teeL	That's up to you. It's asking if it will put your personal information in the Whois database, or if you want to keep it private you'll register it through Domains By Proxy and it'll hide your personal information.
2007-03-04T14:54:00.000Z	teeL	billymeter	Ok, the private one is cheaper, and i dont need my personal information in the whois database =p But when i press Private it just adds the private domain, do i have to remove the other one?
2007-03-04T14:55:00.000Z	billymeter	teeL	I'm not quite sure what you're asking.
2007-03-04T14:55:00.000Z	teeL	billymeter	Ok, i'll just take the public one ^^
2007-03-04T14:57:00.000Z	teeL	billymeter	Im about to checkout now, but godaddy asks for "New PayPal Information. Please enter in a friendly name to identify this PayPal account: " I dont know what to type there
2007-03-04T14:58:00.000Z	billymeter	teeL	I think you put in your paypal username there.
2007-03-04T14:58:00.000Z	teeL		ok
2007-03-04T15:03:00.000Z	teeL	billymeter	Oh, its working now :D But is it possible to set up reverse dns to my dedicated server for free? =p
2007-03-04T15:05:00.000Z	billymeter	teeL	I'm not sure if GoDaddy supports that or not. Might have to try using a service at DynDns.com or equivalent
2007-03-04T15:05:00.000Z	teeL	billymeter	Ah ok, ill try dyndns. Thanks for helping :)
2007-03-04T15:06:00.000Z	billymeter	teeL	No problem.
