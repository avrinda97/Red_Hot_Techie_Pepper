2005-06-18T13:07:00.000Z	goye2cz		Has anyone installed Skype? I'm having trouble finding the libqt3c102-mt package.
2005-06-18T13:07:00.000Z	bob2	goye2cz	libqt3-mt
2005-06-18T13:08:00.000Z	goye2cz	bob2	so I'm looking for the wrong package?
2005-06-18T13:10:00.000Z	bob2	goye2cz	libqt3c102-mt is correct, and it is indeed in ubuntu
2005-06-18T13:12:00.000Z	bob2	goye2cz	ignore that then
2005-06-18T13:12:00.000Z	bob2	goye2cz	sudo aptitude instll libqt3c102-mt
2005-06-18T13:12:00.000Z	bob2	goye2cz	if that doesn't work, your /etc/apt/sources.list is misconfigured
2005-06-18T13:13:00.000Z	goye2cz	bob2	anything is possible. I did download the .deb package and started following instructions on the ubuntu wiki page. I'll try what you just said though.
2005-06-18T13:22:00.000Z	goye2cz	bob2	well, I tried and nothing has helped me yet. You said " if that doesn't work, your /etc/apt/sources.list is misconfigured". What's left for me to try now?
2005-06-18T13:22:00.000Z	bob2	goye2cz	configuring it properly
2005-06-18T13:22:00.000Z	bob2	goye2cz	paste it to #flood
2005-06-18T13:25:00.000Z	bob2	goye2cz	we need to see /etc/apt/sources.list
2005-06-18T13:41:00.000Z	bob2	goye2cz	no, into your terminal
2005-06-18T14:14:00.000Z	bob2	goye2cz	what sort of machine is it?
2005-06-20T10:16:00.000Z	bob2	goye2cz	try asking on the mailing list
2005-06-20T10:16:00.000Z	goye2cz	bob2	mailing list for alsa firmware?
2005-06-20T10:16:00.000Z	bob2	goye2cz	http://lists.ubuntu.com/
2005-06-20T10:17:00.000Z	goye2cz	bob2	thx
