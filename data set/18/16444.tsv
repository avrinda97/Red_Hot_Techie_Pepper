2010-07-11T18:37:00.000Z	maco	erkan^	not that im aware, but check the wine appdb
2010-07-11T18:37:00.000Z	maco	erkan^	i found adjusting to the GIMP as a PSP user easier than adjusting to Photo Shop
2010-07-11T18:38:00.000Z	maco	erkan^	though i still wish it had left-click-to-dodge/right-click-to-burn like PSP8 did :P
2010-07-11T18:42:00.000Z	maco	erkan^	it has separate toolbox windows, just like photoshop on a mac does, but the menus and such are less confusing (IMO) than photoshop and overall about the same complexity level as PSP
2010-07-11T18:43:00.000Z	maco	erkan^	in my opinion
2010-07-11T18:43:00.000Z	maco	erkan^	im heading offline now
