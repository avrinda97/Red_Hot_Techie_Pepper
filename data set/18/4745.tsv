2010-03-01T15:30:00.000Z	AndyGraybeal		i'm in ubuntu 8.10. i've edited ~/.config/user-dirs.dirs ; the Documents section i've pointed to another folder, set the correct permissions, but when i go to Documents.. it still wants to go to /home/username/Documents .. any ideas?
2010-03-01T15:31:00.000Z	p1oooop	AndyGraybeal	ever think of doing a symlink instead?
2010-03-01T15:37:00.000Z	AndyGraybeal	p1oooop	sounds like a kludge though since this config file isn't working :(
2010-03-01T15:38:00.000Z	p1oooop	AndyGraybeal	did you try restarting?
2010-03-01T15:38:00.000Z	AndyGraybeal	p1oooop	i restartd x, but not the whole machine
2010-03-01T15:39:00.000Z	p1oooop	AndyGraybeal	will it hurt to do a full restart?
2010-03-01T15:39:00.000Z	AndyGraybeal	p1oooop	i'll try try it
2010-03-01T15:43:00.000Z	AndyGraybeal	p1oooop	okay, still didn't work; any other ideas? i'm gonna rm -rf /home/username/Documents and then ln -s.
2010-03-01T15:44:00.000Z	p1oooop	AndyGraybeal	I'd backup before I do that though
2010-03-01T15:44:00.000Z	AndyGraybeal	p1oooop	ther's nothing there
2010-03-01T15:45:00.000Z	AndyGraybeal	p1oooop	i have the group set properly
2010-03-01T15:45:00.000Z	p1oooop	AndyGraybeal	works.
2010-03-01T15:45:00.000Z	AndyGraybeal	p1oooop	you mean just having the group works ? (i'm sorry)
2010-03-01T15:46:00.000Z	p1oooop	AndyGraybeal	I would assume... I don't mess with permissions much...
2010-03-01T15:46:00.000Z	p1oooop	AndyGraybeal	if it doesn't go ahead and set owner
2010-03-01T16:00:00.000Z	p1oooop	AndyGraybeal	I think 9.4
2010-03-01T16:00:00.000Z	AndyGraybeal	p1oooop	okay thankyou
2010-03-01T16:00:00.000Z	p1oooop	AndyGraybeal	and from there, to 9.10 if you dist upgrade again
