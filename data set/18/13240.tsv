2008-05-29T03:16:00.000Z	Stormx2	will00	have you seen my PMs?
2008-05-29T03:21:00.000Z	Stormx2	will00	Which programs have you tried?
2008-05-29T03:22:00.000Z	Stormx2	will00	Some programs have LIRC interfaces built in. Some don't. But first you need to test that LIRC is working. Open a terminal and type "irw". Then start pressing buttons on your remote.
2008-05-29T03:25:00.000Z	Stormx2	will00	say my nickname in any messages you send to me. I might not see them otherwise.
2008-05-29T03:27:00.000Z	will00	Stormx2	is irc case sensitive?
2008-05-29T03:32:00.000Z	Stormx2	will00	No, shouldn't be.
2008-05-29T03:34:00.000Z	Stormx2	will00	Some programs have LIRC interfaces built in. Some don't. But first you need to test that LIRC is working. Open a terminal and type "irw". Then start pressing buttons on your remote.
2008-05-29T03:35:00.000Z	Stormx2	will00	Try doing this first: sudo /etc/init.d/lirc start
2008-05-29T03:35:00.000Z	Stormx2	will00	Or it may be this: sudo /etc/init.d/lircd start
2008-05-29T03:36:00.000Z	Stormx2	will00	Does irw work now?
2008-05-29T03:40:00.000Z	Stormx2	will00	Hmm. Not good.
2008-05-29T03:45:00.000Z	Stormx2	will00	When you installed LIRC, it should have come up with a window asking what remote you'd like to use
2008-05-29T03:48:00.000Z	Stormx2	will00	No. What ubuntu version do you use? Hardy?
2008-05-29T03:49:00.000Z	Stormx2	will00	sudo dpkg-reconfigure lirc <-- do that from a terminal.
2008-05-29T03:50:00.000Z	Stormx2	will00	sudo /etc/init.d/lirc restart
2008-05-29T03:50:00.000Z	Stormx2	will00	then do irw again.
2008-05-29T03:52:00.000Z	Stormx2	will00	Hmm. What IR receiver are you using? The standard windows media center edition one?
2008-05-29T03:53:00.000Z	Stormx2	will00	Hmm. Well I'm not sure what the problem is.
