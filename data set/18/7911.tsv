2008-08-10T11:24:00.000Z	DozedOnLinux		﻿amazen720: ok , have you gone through the steps on that page that configures NdisWrapper ?
2008-08-10T11:26:00.000Z	DozedOnLinux		﻿amazen720: you need to blacklist what is said to do so, then you need to use ndiswrapper to install driver using the "working" windows driver.
2008-08-10T11:26:00.000Z	DozedOnLinux		﻿amazen720: ok
2008-08-10T11:27:00.000Z	DozedOnLinux		﻿amazen720:  after you do the command (this will tell you if install went good) >  ndiswrapper -l
2008-08-10T11:28:00.000Z	DozedOnLinux		﻿amazen720: let me know if you get a good message such as "driver present, hardware present"
2008-08-10T11:29:00.000Z	DozedOnLinux		﻿amazen720:  Load the new driver module section if ﻿"driver present, hardware present"
