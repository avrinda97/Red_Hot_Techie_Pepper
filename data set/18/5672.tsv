2012-07-26T03:30:00.000Z	bekks	studio	You HAVE to wait until they are moved.
2012-07-26T03:31:00.000Z	bekks	studio	It is like a sheet of paper - you cant instantly move it from one office to another. You have to transport it, fax it, scan and email it, etc.
2012-07-26T03:32:00.000Z	bekks	studio	having TWO physical drives, HOW do you thing an information is going to be transferred to the other drive?
2012-07-26T03:32:00.000Z	bekks	studio	technically impossible, in terms of waiting times.
2012-07-26T03:36:00.000Z	studio	bekks	lol
2012-07-26T03:38:00.000Z	bekks	studio	Using home driven hardware, it is not possible.

2012-07-26T03:39:00.000Z	bekks	studio	Prove it then.
2012-07-26T03:39:00.000Z	bekks	studio	And not a single on told you that it is possible :)
