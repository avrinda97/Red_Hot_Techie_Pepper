2006-09-01T08:34:00.000Z	Warbo	h00t	Applications>Accessories>Alacarte Menu Editor
2006-09-01T08:35:00.000Z	Warbo	h00t	Tell me when that's open
2006-09-01T08:36:00.000Z	Warbo	h00t	OK, go on System Tools on the left
2006-09-01T08:36:00.000Z	Warbo	h00t	Then tick "Configuration Editor"
2006-09-01T08:36:00.000Z	Warbo	h00t	Then quit Alacarte and go in Applications>System Tools>Configuration Editor
2006-09-01T08:37:00.000Z	Warbo	h00t	There should be.... You could try launching it manually with "gconfeditor"
2006-09-01T08:39:00.000Z	Warbo	h00t	Looks like it should be "gconf-editor"
2006-09-01T08:41:00.000Z	h00t	Warbo	I actualy found it, enabled it and ran it... now what .. i can't see anything about making shortcuts
2006-09-01T08:42:00.000Z	Warbo	h00t	OK, apps>nautilus>desktop
2006-09-01T08:42:00.000Z	Warbo	h00t	(I think it is desktop, maybe something different, but still obvious)
2006-09-01T08:42:00.000Z	Warbo	h00t	There is also this.....
2006-09-01T08:43:00.000Z	h00t	Warbo	what is this Configuration Editor ... is it kinda like registry in Win
2006-09-01T08:44:00.000Z	Warbo	h00t	A bit, but it is only for GNOME programs, so nothing system level is stored there
2006-09-01T08:44:00.000Z	Warbo	h00t	Most of it can be changed with preferences dialogs, especially if you install gtweakui package
2006-09-01T08:44:00.000Z	h00t	Warbo	jikanter: so kde doesn't have the same thing
