2011-05-04T14:53:00.000Z	json		What is the command to change the permissions (owner, group and execute as program) of a file from 'root' to my account ?
2011-05-04T14:53:00.000Z	celthunder	json	chown and chmod
2011-05-04T14:54:00.000Z	json	celthunder	just chown and chmod ? Nothing else ?
2011-05-04T14:54:00.000Z	celthunder	json	what else do you need? chown can change group and owner chmod changes execute read and writability of the group user and other
2011-05-04T14:55:00.000Z	json	celthunder	Yes, but no other args ? As in just, $ chown <file> will do it for me ?
2011-05-04T14:56:00.000Z	celthunder	json	chown <user>:<group> <file> <file2>
2011-05-04T14:57:00.000Z	json	celthunder	Thanks ! And to execute the file as program, giving read/write privileges as well  ?
2011-05-04T14:58:00.000Z	celthunder	json	chmod <user><group><other> <file> <file2>  777 is everyone can do everything
2011-05-04T14:58:00.000Z	json	celthunder	Thank you !
2011-05-04T14:59:00.000Z	celthunder	json	to set on a directory add a -R after chmod so chmod -R 777 / means everyone can do anything on any file (don't do that...it's suicidal)
2011-05-04T14:59:00.000Z	json	celthunder	Yup, I needed that, too ! It's only me... !
2011-05-04T15:00:00.000Z	celthunder	json	the -R works on both commands btw
2011-05-04T15:01:00.000Z	json	celthunder	Is there a book where you get your info from ? I mean, besides, the man pages... ?
2011-05-04T15:01:00.000Z	celthunder	json	man pages and common command knowledge
2011-05-04T15:02:00.000Z	json	celthunder	man pages, then for me !
2011-05-04T15:03:00.000Z	celthunder	json	they're there for a reason :)
2011-05-04T15:03:00.000Z	celthunder	json	theres some bash guides as someone just suggested that might help if you're lazy
2011-05-04T15:05:00.000Z	json	celthunder	yes, thank you, thank you !
