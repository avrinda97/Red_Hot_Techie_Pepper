2011-02-06T16:47:00.000Z	sacarlson	Temar	did you use the alternate adition to install your raid system,  it seems to guide you through what can and can't do
2011-02-06T16:48:00.000Z	sacarlson	Temar	so setup using the desktop edition?
2011-02-06T16:50:00.000Z	sacarlson	Temar	if not much to loose sometimes easier just to reinstall
2011-02-06T16:51:00.000Z	sacarlson	Temar	trial and error is alot of work,  install is about 30 min
2011-02-06T16:53:00.000Z	sacarlson	Temar	ok so what does sudo fdisk -l look like now then
2011-02-06T17:06:00.000Z	Temar	sacarlson	done the command, i got 2 drives listed, top (the 1 i want) has 3 partitians sda1 has * under Boot
2011-02-06T17:12:00.000Z	sacarlson	Temar	try install rfkill and see what it see's
2011-02-06T17:13:00.000Z	sacarlson	Temar	also look in bios boot see if wifi is visable there
2011-02-06T17:31:00.000Z	sacarlson	Temar	yes got you confused with rsv when you didn't  add anything about the subject sorry
2011-02-06T17:33:00.000Z	sacarlson	Temar	well I don't see any info about a raid install,  what you gave me just says you have 3 partitions
2011-02-06T17:34:00.000Z	sacarlson	Temar	what file format are they?  can you mount them from a live cd boot?
2011-02-06T17:35:00.000Z	sacarlson	Temar	hard to peace this altogether
2011-02-06T17:36:00.000Z	sacarlson	Temar	from a live cd you can't mount read write?
2011-02-06T17:39:00.000Z	sacarlson	Temar	so what is your plan?  mount the raid disk partitions,  move them to a none raid partitions setup grub2 to point to the new disks and be done with it?
2011-02-06T17:42:00.000Z	sacarlson	Temar	oh I don't think grub-legacy will boot from a raid device but grub2 will, so that may have been where some of your problems started
2011-02-06T17:45:00.000Z	sacarlson	Temar	opps forgot the sudo in mount also
2011-02-06T18:17:00.000Z	sacarlson	Temar	good for you
2011-02-06T18:18:00.000Z	sacarlson	Temar	oh hardware raid
