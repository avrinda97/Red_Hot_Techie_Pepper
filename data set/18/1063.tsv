2011-06-22T08:39:00.000Z	dlong		I am trying to connect a ubuntu 11.04 computer and a 10.04 box via wired connection and can't get them to talk.  The network cables are connected via a switch, their link lights are on, ethtool says link detected and the ip addresses are 192.168.2.15 and 192.168.2.16, respectively.  iptables is off on both machines, yet they can't ping each other.  Any ideas to help?
2011-06-22T08:41:00.000Z	PythonPup	dlong	 On the 192.168.2.15 machine, open a terminal prompt and type   ping -c 4 192.168.2.16
2011-06-22T08:42:00.000Z	dlong	PythonPup	like I mentioned, they are not able to ping each other
2011-06-22T08:43:00.000Z	PythonPup	dlong	 You said they could not talk.  I thought you might need to innstall
2011-06-22T08:43:00.000Z	PythonPup	dlong	 You said they could not talk.  I thought you might need to install festival.
2011-06-22T08:44:00.000Z	PythonPup	dlong	So, do you have a router at 192.168.2.1?
2011-06-22T08:44:00.000Z	dlong	PythonPup	no, I don't
2011-06-22T08:45:00.000Z	PythonPup	dlong	Don't be mysterious.  What is your router IP?
2011-06-22T08:49:00.000Z	dlong	PythonPup	there is no router.  these two boxes are just on the same subnet, that's it
2011-06-22T08:50:00.000Z	PythonPup	dlong	so what does your routing table look like.
2011-06-22T08:52:00.000Z	dlong	PythonPup	there is a route for eth0 at 192.168.2.0/24.
2011-06-22T08:55:00.000Z	dlong	PythonPup	any other ideas.  I am stumped
2011-06-22T08:57:00.000Z	PythonPup	dlong	you probably don't have the nics setup right.  I am guessing, because you have not said much, that you setup static IP addresses.  You probably have the netmack or gateway wrong.  So, the NICs don't know how to communicate with other machines.
2011-06-22T08:58:00.000Z	dlong	PythonPup	the netmask on both is /24.  I don't have a gw set
2011-06-22T08:59:00.000Z	dlong	PythonPup	I don't care about talking to the world, I just want the two computers to talk, ping, to only each other
2011-06-22T09:00:00.000Z	PythonPup	dlong	If you don't give your system a way for a packet to leave one computer, it will neve get to the other one.
2011-06-22T09:23:00.000Z	PythonPup	dlong	the gigabit standard says that ports must support MDI-X, or essentially automatic crossover as needed.  Many 10/100 cards do not support that feature.
2011-06-22T09:25:00.000Z	dlong	PythonPup	thanks for your help as well
