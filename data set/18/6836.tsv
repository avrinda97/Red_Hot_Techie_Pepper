2008-04-09T01:09:00.000Z	Lyricaldogg		Hi everyone, what do i need to make my PC my home server ?
2008-04-09T01:09:00.000Z	Guillem_	Lyricaldogg	it depends of what you want to serve, I guess....
2008-04-09T01:10:00.000Z	Lyricaldogg	Guillem_	in this case just internet
2008-04-09T01:10:00.000Z	Guillem_	Lyricaldogg	you have two ethernet cards?
2008-04-09T01:11:00.000Z	Lyricaldogg	Guillem_	2 eth ? no, 1
2008-04-09T01:11:00.000Z	Guillem_	Lyricaldogg	but  you want to provide internet access to other machines?
2008-04-09T01:12:00.000Z	Lyricaldogg	Guillem_	not alot, just for  laptop that does not have a Dongle
2008-04-09T01:13:00.000Z	Guillem_	Lyricaldogg	which is the configuration? I mean how do you connect the "server" to the internet? and how do you interconnect the "server" and the laptop?
2008-04-09T01:17:00.000Z	Guillem_	Lyricaldogg	then you have two cards at the server: the ethernet card and the wireless card
2008-04-09T01:18:00.000Z	Lyricaldogg	Guillem_	i'm now going to get samba to run and give it a go.... yes i have the ethernet and wireless
2008-04-09T01:18:00.000Z	Guillem_	Lyricaldogg	you have two ways to do this kind of things: 1) a proxy 2) a firewall setup. Proxy is easier to setup but only will give the laptop access to http:// and ftp:// (no games, etc.)
2008-04-09T01:18:00.000Z	Guillem_	Lyricaldogg	samba will let you share files among the machines
2008-04-09T01:19:00.000Z	Guillem_	Lyricaldogg	"firestarter" used to be a nice tool to setup the firewall easily ... It is long I don't use but may do the trick
2008-04-09T01:19:00.000Z	Guillem_	Lyricaldogg	"squid" is the proxy
2008-04-09T01:21:00.000Z	Guillem_	Lyricaldogg	to transfer files to windows OS: samba
2008-04-09T01:21:00.000Z	Guillem_	Lyricaldogg	to surf the web: squid (+ setting up the proxy at windows web browser)
2008-04-09T01:22:00.000Z	Guillem_	Lyricaldogg	to really "share" the internet: you need a firewall setup which routes packages from the windows machine (NAT). Firestarter is your friend here
2008-04-09T01:23:00.000Z	Guillem_	Lyricaldogg	installing samba is like making the linux box behave as a windows machine at a windows network.
