2005-05-24T11:48:00.000Z	transgress	yarlah	you don't add marillat and then update... you add marillat, get what you need from it (w32codecs and libdvdcss2 probably) and then you turn marillat off and update then
2005-05-24T11:50:00.000Z	transgress	yarlah	what did you want from marillat?
2005-05-24T11:53:00.000Z	transgress	yarlah	what are you trying to get off of marillat?
2005-05-24T11:53:00.000Z	transgress	yarlah	you added a repo to your sources.list... why did you add it?  what file did you need?
2005-05-24T11:54:00.000Z	transgress	yarlah	i did tell you that a second ago... anyways... just disable marillat... go into your sources.list and put a # next to ftp.nerim.whateverthehell
2005-05-24T11:55:00.000Z	transgress	yarlah	i don't care... just do what we are saying...
2005-05-24T11:57:00.000Z	transgress	yarlah	as i've said about 30 times... you need like 2-3 things from marillat... if you aren't wanting those... then turn it off... it breaks the upgrade function
