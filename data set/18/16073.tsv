2006-09-29T07:50:00.000Z	Amaranth	mikeo1	There are at least two ops active in the channel and you're swearing....
2006-09-29T07:50:00.000Z	Amaranth	mikeo1	To downgrade you put the dapper CD in your drive, format, and wait for it to finish installing.
2006-09-29T07:51:00.000Z	Amaranth	mikeo1	<mikeo1> fuck how do i downgrade
2006-09-29T07:51:00.000Z	Amaranth	mikeo1	At least let it scroll off the screen before you deny it.
2006-09-29T07:51:00.000Z	Amaranth	mikeo1	Cut it out.
2006-09-29T07:52:00.000Z	Amaranth	mikeo1	Once again, to downgrade you have to format and reinstall.
2006-09-29T07:52:00.000Z	Amaranth	mikeo1	Rather that go through that hassle, why not join #ubuntu+1 and see if we can get edgy working for you?
2006-09-29T07:53:00.000Z	Amaranth	mikeo1	dist-upgrade will not downgrade you, you have to manually tell it to fetch old versions of packages
