2006-12-31T13:13:00.000Z	goldfndr	American-Tech	if you are sure it's a zip file, try renaming from .exe to .zip
2006-12-31T13:37:00.000Z	goldfndr	American-Tech	did you download this .exe from a public website?
2006-12-31T13:38:00.000Z	goldfndr	American-Tech	is "gateway" a public website?

2006-12-31T13:52:00.000Z	goldfndr	American-Tech	you still have a shell open?
2006-12-31T13:58:00.000Z	goldfndr	American-Tech	if you "unzip" the BCM40100.EXE you'll get a file
2006-12-31T14:03:00.000Z	goldfndr	American-Tech	have you tried typing "lspci" yet?
2006-12-31T14:09:00.000Z	goldfndr	American-Tech	have you tried typing "lspci" yet?
2006-12-31T14:20:00.000Z	goldfndr	American-Tech	have you tried typing "lspci" yet?
2006-12-31T14:22:00.000Z	goldfndr	American-Tech	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=1908100 says BCM4311, hopefully that helps, but "lspci" would be best.
