2011-11-15T19:25:00.000Z	mbrochh		hi all. Is it possible to configure the app switcher? the grouping of apps is just horribly ineffective... how do you guys get along with this? maybe I am using it wrongly?
2011-11-15T19:26:00.000Z	spacebug-	mbrochh	you mean alt+tab switcher?
2011-11-15T19:26:00.000Z	mbrochh	spacebug-	yes
2011-11-15T19:28:00.000Z	spacebug-	mbrochh	install compizconfig settings manager (ccsm) and go to unity plugin, go to tab switcher and check the box for "bias alt+tab sorting to prefer windows on the current viewport"
2011-11-15T19:28:00.000Z	mbrochh	spacebug-	will that disable the grouping of apps?
2011-11-15T19:29:00.000Z	spacebug-	mbrochh	that will group the apps from the current desktop first
2011-11-15T19:29:00.000Z	mbrochh	spacebug-	i want no grouping at all. I always run several chrome instances and its horrible to wait for the group to expand in order to switch to a certain window
2011-11-15T19:30:00.000Z	spacebug-	mbrochh	oh I see. Well then I don't know, sorry
2011-11-15T19:30:00.000Z	spacebug-	mbrochh	but I guess you can do something about that also ..at least the time for it to fold out
2011-11-15T19:31:00.000Z	mbrochh	spacebug-	hmm good hint..
2011-11-15T19:39:00.000Z	spacebug-	mbrochh	hey tryck alt+(key above tab)
2011-11-15T19:40:00.000Z	mbrochh	spacebug-	that doesn't do anything here
2011-11-15T19:42:00.000Z	mbrochh	spacebug-	if I would still use the unity switcher i would probably hit alt+tab to open it and then use the arrow keys to navigate... pressing downarrow immediately expands a group... still bullshit, I think. It's totally beyond me how anyone could implement this.
2011-11-15T19:43:00.000Z	spacebug-	mbrochh	if you have two terminals for example and you press alt+key_above_tab it will switch through terminals only
2011-11-15T19:44:00.000Z	mbrochh	spacebug-	sounds like a cool feature, but it seems as if i have disabled that key binding somehow, maybe
2011-11-15T19:45:00.000Z	mbrochh	spacebug-	in the compiz settings manager is that the setting "Key to flip through windows in the switcher"?
2011-11-15T19:46:00.000Z	spacebug-	mbrochh	not sure, mine says "disabled"
2011-11-15T19:48:00.000Z	spacebug-	mbrochh	seems to be yes. Though haveing it set to disable seems to make it use a default (key above tab)
