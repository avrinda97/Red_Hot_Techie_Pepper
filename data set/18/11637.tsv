2006-07-06T16:28:00.000Z	narfmaster	whiter	you may need to install gdm
2006-07-06T16:32:00.000Z	narfmaster	whiter	so what happens?
2006-07-06T16:53:00.000Z	whiter	narfmaster	would you happen to know how to make ubuntu use gtk2 instead of gtk1
2006-07-06T16:53:00.000Z	narfmaster	whiter	i have no idea :/
2006-07-06T16:54:00.000Z	narfmaster	whiter	no problem :)
2006-07-24T14:38:00.000Z	narfmaster	whiter	you should install openclipart-svg and check out some of that stuff
2006-07-24T14:39:00.000Z	whiter	narfmaster	that would probably work but i cant write to the hdd
2006-07-24T14:39:00.000Z	narfmaster	whiter	sorry that was meant for someone else :p
