2006-11-16T17:08:00.000Z	ivan		Hi everybody, I am having a question about Synaptic. I am trying to lock a version of gaim to 2.0b3, but it has no effect. I select packages gaim and gaim-data and them click on packages and then click on lock version, but it has no effect. can somebody give me a tip on how it can be done from the command line?
2006-11-16T17:09:00.000Z	Williamts99	ivan	it is something like sudo apt-get hold gaim

2006-11-16T17:09:00.000Z	ivan		ok, thanks. will try.. didn't see anything in the man page for apt-get about it...
2006-11-16T17:10:00.000Z	ivan		hm... i get a E: Invalid operation hold
2006-11-16T17:11:00.000Z	Williamts99	ivan	give me a sec
2006-11-16T17:13:00.000Z	Williamts99	ivan	it's sudo aptitude hold gaim
2006-11-16T17:13:00.000Z	Williamts99	ivan	sorry I got it mixed up
2006-11-16T17:15:00.000Z	ivan		<Williamts99>, it looks like i found a way to do it, it is done with apt_preferences or with a config file /etc/apt/preferences. It is done by 'pining' the version
2006-11-16T17:15:00.000Z	ivan		i think =)
2006-11-16T17:22:00.000Z	Williamts99	ivan	glad you got it figured out
2006-11-16T17:23:00.000Z	ivan		yup.. just checked it out.. works like a charm via the config file.. strange why synaptic didn't want to work with it.. oh well, i'm happy that it works
2006-11-16T17:25:00.000Z	Williamts99		I am surprised that lock version didn't work, which version are you using?
2006-11-16T17:25:00.000Z	ivan		edgy
2006-11-16T17:26:00.000Z	ivan		well, i'm not afraid of bugs, still got it working
2006-11-16T17:26:00.000Z	ivan	MattJ	have a look at this: http://www.arsgeek.com/?p=675
2006-11-16T17:27:00.000Z	ivan		I didn't try it myself, but I bookmarked it just in case i need it (I don't have ntfs partitions)
2006-11-16T17:31:00.000Z	Williamts99	ivan	true, at least you got it to work
