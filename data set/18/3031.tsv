2009-12-31T03:11:00.000Z	recmajkemi		Is this statement correct?: I am using ubuntu 9.10 it is in gnome enviroment theerefore i cannot install any KDE aplications.
2009-12-31T03:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	recmajkemi	 false. I run kde apps on gnome all the time
2009-12-31T03:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	recmajkemi	 and visa-versa
2009-12-31T03:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	recmajkemi	 You can occasionally have a few quirky issues when mixing the 2. but normlly things workj fine
2010-01-03T07:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	recmajkemi	 you mean to ask how you can connect to wireless without entering the keyring password?
2010-01-03T07:51:00.000Z	recmajkemi	Dr_Willis	yes
2010-01-03T07:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	recmajkemi	 i got a video of how to set the keyring password to 'empty/change it' at -> http://drop.io/dr_willis
2010-01-03T07:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	recmajkemi	 its easier to just show then to explain. :)
2010-01-03T07:52:00.000Z	recmajkemi	Dr_Willis	I tried over authorisations but i dont know how to
2010-01-03T07:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	recmajkemi	 i set my keyring password to be empty that way it dosent bother to ask.. wireless then connects automatically
2010-01-03T07:53:00.000Z	recmajkemi	Dr_Willis	in my previous instalation be4 crash, there was a box always allow
2010-01-03T07:54:00.000Z	recmajkemi	Dr_Willis	Is it in authorisations, or somwhere else to do it?
2010-01-03T07:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	recmajkemi	 never noticed an always allow.. I just tweak my keyring password. Explore that apps-> acessories -> passwords and keys   tool perhaps
