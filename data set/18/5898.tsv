2008-12-15T09:23:00.000Z	Dolo		i keep seeing a service called gate crasher in my firewall and when i looked online it said its a windows backdoor but im running linux
2008-12-15T09:24:00.000Z	Dolo		it says the source is my ip
2008-12-15T09:25:00.000Z	Dolo		is something running? on my pc?
2008-12-15T09:26:00.000Z	Dolo		i was getting this from my firewall list
2008-12-15T09:26:00.000Z	histo	Dolo	do you have any windows ocmputers behind you?
2008-12-15T09:27:00.000Z	histo	Dolo	its not wine
2008-12-15T09:27:00.000Z	histo	Dolo	yes you would see it in system monitor. Which firewall are you talking of?
2008-12-15T09:28:00.000Z	histo	Dolo	are youusing bit torrent?
2008-12-15T09:29:00.000Z	histo	Dolo	bit torrent uses the same port and firestarter thinks its gate crasher
2008-12-15T09:30:00.000Z	histo	Dolo	 if thats the case yes
2008-12-15T09:31:00.000Z	Dolo	histo	if its a windows backdoor then my linux wont be affected right
2008-12-15T09:31:00.000Z	histo	Dolo	correct as others have stated I guess its possible for wine to run viruses backdoors etc.. that would just mess up you .wine folder in your home if thats even possible.
2008-12-15T09:31:00.000Z	histo	Dolo	are you using bit torrent though?
2008-12-15T09:31:00.000Z	Dolo	histo	I'm using Vuze a bit torrent client
2008-12-15T09:32:00.000Z	histo	Dolo	well you may want to check what port its using. I bet its using the same port that the window trojan uses thats why firestarter is allerting.
2008-12-15T09:32:00.000Z	histo	Dolo	its just mis identifying it.
2008-12-15T09:35:00.000Z	Dolo	histo	Should I shut off the firewall when running torrent?
2008-12-15T09:35:00.000Z	histo	Dolo	you don't have to just make acceptions for those ports.
