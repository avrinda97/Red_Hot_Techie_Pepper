2010-06-26T02:38:00.000Z	ChrazRitt_		i have  a 3 month old laptop that i just installed ubuntu 10.04 amd 64 desktop version on to dual boot with windows 7. my problem is that when running ubuntu the computer sometimes locks up forcing a power switch reboot. 7 has a cooling management section, and i suspect tthat my lockup issue is due to heat issues because the exaust vent isn't putting out near the heat sa it does in windows. does anyone know of a cooling management scr

2010-06-26T02:39:00.000Z	actionParsnip	ChrazRitt_	if you restart the X server does it unfreeze or is it super frozen?
2010-06-26T02:40:00.000Z	actionParsnip	ChrazRitt_	if its a cheap unit (most acers do tyhis) then it will probably have a software monitor for heat rather than a decent hardware monitor to automate the activity
2010-06-26T02:41:00.000Z	actionParsnip	ChrazRitt_	head into the keyboard section under preferences and re-enable CTRL+ALT+BACKSPACE   when it locks, press CTRL+ALT+BACKSPACE   and see if the x server restarts
2010-06-26T02:41:00.000Z	actionParsnip	ChrazRitt_	depends if they have scrimped on the cooling
2010-06-26T02:43:00.000Z	actionParsnip	ChrazRitt_	do you have the latest BIOS?
2010-06-26T02:44:00.000Z	actionParsnip	ChrazRitt_	can you tab com[plete my nick if you are addressing me, it makes it a LOT easier to read
2010-06-26T02:46:00.000Z	actionParsnip	ChrazRitt_	i know, its just hard to read in a sea of text, addressing  me highlights the text so is very easy to pick out ;)
2010-06-26T02:46:00.000Z	ChrazRitt_	actionParsnip	i realized it when you brought up the name thing
2010-06-26T02:49:00.000Z	actionParsnip	ChrazRitt_	if you install lm-sensors and watch the temperature when it hangs, see if its heat related. Should show high temp. Also feel the device to see if its hot. I'd also run a memory test from grub (hold shift at boot)
2010-06-26T02:50:00.000Z	ChrazRitt_	actionParsnip	do you know of a script that includes cooling control, or can contain a cooling control command?
2010-06-26T02:52:00.000Z	actionParsnip	ChrazRitt_	no idea dude, i'm sure there are commands, you could use cpufreq to clock the cpu when it gets hot but it sounds like theres a cheap software heat management in there, lm-sensors will highlight this
2010-06-26T02:53:00.000Z	ChrazRitt_	actionParsnip	the vent where the heat normally comes out is much cooler than normal, but i never felt around the rest of the machinr for heat levels
2010-06-26T02:55:00.000Z	ChrazRitt_	actionParsnip	in 7 there is a cooling management section where it is currently set to speed up the fan before slowing the cpu, and so there is some software control options, therefore i suspect my issue is caused by the fan not being controled
2010-06-26T02:57:00.000Z	ChrazRitt_	actionParsnip	that htemp monitor is in the package manager?
2010-06-26T03:04:00.000Z	ChrazRitt_	actionParsnip	i'm having dependency issues with the install
2010-06-26T03:05:00.000Z	actionParsnip	ChrazRitt_	then get them satisfied
