2006-03-04T07:09:00.000Z	_jason	jason_	just ask your question
2006-04-11T11:54:00.000Z	_jason	jason_	hi :)
2006-04-11T11:55:00.000Z	_jason	jason_	yes, follow the restricted formats page
2006-04-11T12:18:00.000Z	_jason	jason_	did you enable universe and multiverse?
2006-04-11T12:19:00.000Z	jason_	_jason	yes
2006-04-11T12:20:00.000Z	_jason	jason_	those packages are in multiverse.  When you used synaptic to enable the repositories did you remember to edit all of the universe ones and change it to say universe multiverse?
2006-04-11T12:21:00.000Z	_jason	jason_	that will only give you breezy-backpoorts multiverse.  Check the wiki page on adding multiverse again, press ctrl-f and enter ``multiverse''.  There is a sentence that explains what you need to do
2006-04-11T12:33:00.000Z	_jason	jason_	it's on the restricted formats page
