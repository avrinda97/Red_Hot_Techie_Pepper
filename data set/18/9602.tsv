2007-03-17T16:27:00.000Z	andre_pl		this may sound crazy, but when I load ipw3945, my keyboard stop responding and cpu shoots up to 50%
2007-03-17T16:27:00.000Z	xtknight	andre_pl	do you have a wireless kb?
2007-03-17T16:28:00.000Z	andre_pl	xtknight	no.itsa laptop
2007-03-17T16:28:00.000Z	xtknight	andre_pl	what kind of cpu load?  i/o (disk, dark blue) or processing (light blue)?  you can see the different kinds of cpu load via gnome-system-monitor
2007-03-17T16:30:00.000Z	xtknight	andre_pl	hm how did you spacebar break?  damage to the kb circuit?  maybe it's related?
2007-03-17T16:30:00.000Z	andre_pl	xtknight	different_computer
2007-03-17T16:31:00.000Z	xtknight	andre_pl	oh. hmm well check the cpu thing

2007-03-17T16:32:00.000Z	xtknight	andre_pl	hrmm??
2007-03-17T05:25:00.000Z	xtknight	andre_pl	google xmodmap perhaps
2007-03-17T05:26:00.000Z	andre_pl	xtknight	thanks.. it appears I need to know the keycode of the space, that could be a problem. :P
2007-03-17T05:27:00.000Z	xtknight	andre_pl	ASCII code 32 ?
2007-03-17T05:28:00.000Z	andre_pl	xtknight	doesn't go by ascii codes though, they unique to every keyboard.
2007-03-17T05:28:00.000Z	xtknight	andre_pl	use xev to grab the keycode for space?
2007-03-17T05:29:00.000Z	xtknight	andre_pl	state 0x0, keycode 65 (keysym 0x20, space), same_screen YES,
2007-03-17T05:29:00.000Z	xtknight	andre_pl	well maybe it's 65 for my KB
2007-03-17T05:29:00.000Z	xtknight	andre_pl	i think i use the standard 103 kb or w/e it is, it's probably 65 for most people?
2007-03-17T05:36:00.000Z	andre_pl	xtknight	got it working, thanks... guess i need some new AAAs
