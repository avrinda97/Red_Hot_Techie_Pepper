2009-07-13T13:09:00.000Z	Keranu		I'm having some serious boot problems with Ubuntu
2009-07-13T13:09:00.000Z	Keranu		I think the problem lies with my BIOS and the way it's detecting my hard drives
2009-07-13T13:10:00.000Z	Keranu		So here's the problem:
2009-07-13T13:11:00.000Z	Keranu		I've tried installing Ubuntu with Windows XP many times and I end up either being able to boot up straight to XP with no sight of Ubuntu or I'll be able to boot up GRUB but when I click on XP, it gives me error 21 (selected disk does not exist, I think)
2009-07-13T13:13:00.000Z	Keranu		I tried installing Grub from the Ubuntu installer on every possible path when I made partitions for Windows XP and Ubuntu on the same hard drive
2009-07-13T13:13:00.000Z	Keranu		Now I am trying to install Ubuntu on my second hard drive instead
2009-07-13T13:13:00.000Z	Keranu		When I tried this, I installed Grub to (hd1), but now when I try to boot my system, it says Grub Hard Disk Error
2009-07-13T13:14:00.000Z	[R]	Keranu	you shoudl install grub to your first rrive
2009-07-14T12:51:00.000Z	[R]	Keranu	what exactly do you mean you installed it to the sd card?
2009-07-14T12:52:00.000Z	[R]	Keranu	but you installed ubuntu to your hard drive?
2009-07-14T12:53:00.000Z	[R]	Keranu	yeah... of course there are gonna be no files onthe card
2009-07-14T12:53:00.000Z	[R]	Keranu	selecting the device to "instal lgrub" to just puts it in the mbr
2009-07-14T12:53:00.000Z	[R]	Keranu	doesnt copy any files
2009-07-14T12:54:00.000Z	Keranu	[R]	I was trying to follow these instructions http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=56723

2009-07-14T12:58:00.000Z	Keranu	[R]	Did you see this? http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=56723
2009-07-14T12:59:00.000Z	[R]	Keranu	nope... i generally don't like to read forum posts by people who have no clue what they are doing
2009-07-14T13:01:00.000Z	[R]	Keranu	seems severly crack induced
