2005-12-04T06:12:00.000Z	keverets		Argh.  I can't resolve any domain names with ubuntu now.  Helpfully the /etc/resolv.conf tells me that it's all managed by NetworkManager now, so I don't need to worry about it.  Which would be fine.  If it worked.
2005-12-04T06:13:00.000Z	keverets		how do I convince it to actually resolve some domain names (the proper DNS servers should be picked up through DHCP)?
2005-12-04T06:14:00.000Z	PokerFacePenguin	keverets	this may be asking the obvious, but have you installed firewall software that is blocking DNS?
2005-12-04T06:15:00.000Z	keverets	PokerFacePenguin	sadly, no.  It's between my laptop and the openwrt router which was working fine yesterday, but firing up the laptop today has made it decide to not deal with DNS.
2005-12-04T06:16:00.000Z	PokerFacePenguin	keverets	and another pc will get DNS from that router fine?
2005-12-04T06:16:00.000Z	keverets	PokerFacePenguin	yup.
2005-12-04T06:17:00.000Z	keverets	PokerFacePenguin	I may try power-cycling ("/etc/init.d/networking restart" doesn't change anything), but this is starting to feel more like Windows all the time.
2005-12-04T06:18:00.000Z	PokerFacePenguin	keverets	lol, not even close to those headaches...try to recycle....see if it helps....maybe u can pastebin some stuff and work it out
2005-12-04T06:19:00.000Z	keverets	PokerFacePenguin	OK, I'll try the recycle.  Any hints on what I should pastebin if that doesn't  help?
2005-12-04T06:19:00.000Z	PokerFacePenguin	keverets	have you modified resolv.conf at all?
2005-12-04T06:20:00.000Z	PokerFacePenguin	keverets	wonder what would happen if you renamed the /etc/resolv.conf file to something else before u reboot
2005-12-04T06:29:00.000Z	keverets	PokerFacePenguin	Haven't touched /etc/resolv.conf (though it looks like NetworkManager has)... rebooting didn't help.  Will try the removing of /etc/resolv.conf before rebooting this time.
2005-12-04T06:29:00.000Z	PokerFacePenguin	keverets	worth a shot
2005-12-04T06:30:00.000Z	PokerFacePenguin	keverets	i would rename it instead of delete it
2005-12-04T06:36:00.000Z	keverets	PokerFacePenguin	It didn't have anything in it, anyway.
2005-12-04T06:37:00.000Z	keverets	PokerFacePenguin	got an error from /etc/init.d/resolvconf that /etc/resolv.conf is not a symbolic link to /etc/resolvconf/run/resolv.conf, so I made that link, restarted resolvconf and now it sees the DNS again.
2005-12-04T06:37:00.000Z	keverets	PokerFacePenguin	thanks for your help.
2005-12-04T06:37:00.000Z	PokerFacePenguin	keverets	cool beans...good job
