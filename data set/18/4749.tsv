2009-12-26T21:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	donvito-	yes, you can add it as a repo as well and install from that
2009-12-26T22:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	donvito-	thats why we have that page to tell you
2009-12-26T22:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	donvito-	you are using an unsupported release so support is harder
2009-12-26T22:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	donvito-	your release has been 8 months dead now
2009-12-26T22:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	donvito-	sure it will work but you wont gt updates as there are no repos for it except your install cd
2009-12-26T22:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	donvito-	if you download the alternate ISO for hardy, you can use it to upgrade to hardy which is the oldest release still supported
