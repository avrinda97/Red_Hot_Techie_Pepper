2010-02-03T18:02:00.000Z	erikvold		hello, I'm green to ubuntu, and I've got a weird issue
2010-02-03T18:02:00.000Z	erikvold		I am the administrator, but I don't have permission to commands like chown, and mkdir
2010-02-03T18:02:00.000Z	erikvold		I have to sudo every command
2010-02-03T18:03:00.000Z	Pici	erikvold	Thats normal.
2010-02-03T18:03:00.000Z	erikvold		how can I fix this?
2010-02-03T18:03:00.000Z	erikvold		I'm tryng to install gitolite and it's crashing because of this
2010-02-03T18:03:00.000Z	erikvold		it needs access to mkdir
2010-02-03T18:03:00.000Z	Pici	erikvold	If you need to use sudo for long periods of time, use sudo -i, and you'll get a root prompt.
2010-02-03T18:03:00.000Z	erikvold		and git clone
2010-02-03T18:04:00.000Z	Pici	erikvold	So, run its installer (or whatever) with sudo.
2010-02-03T18:04:00.000Z	erikvold		when I sudo tho I think that the root's rsa key is being used which is missing it up
2010-02-03T18:04:00.000Z	erikvold		because the root's home directory is used instead of my user's
2010-02-03T18:05:00.000Z	Pici	erikvold	sudo -i will use root's environment
2010-02-03T18:05:00.000Z	Pici	erikvold	sudo -s will use your user's environment
2010-02-03T18:08:00.000Z	Pici		!de | summer10
2010-02-03T18:27:00.000Z	erikvold		so sudo -s, sudo -i, and sudo -s -u erikvold all did not help
2010-02-03T18:27:00.000Z	erikvold		with sudo -s I still get permission denied for mkdir
2010-02-03T18:30:00.000Z	erikvold	Pici	sudo -s didn't work, the ssh pubkey access is using the root's ~ directory
