2011-06-16T12:54:00.000Z	DJHenjin		it worked before
2011-06-16T12:55:00.000Z	DJHenjin		10.04
2011-06-16T12:55:00.000Z	strata_	DJHenjin	and it stopped working after you did an update or something
2011-06-16T12:55:00.000Z	strata_		?
2011-06-16T12:55:00.000Z	DJHenjin		the emc2 site made it very clear that it was a bad idea to do a dist upgrade or update after install
2011-06-16T12:55:00.000Z	DJHenjin		because it would break emc2
2011-06-16T12:56:00.000Z	strata_	DJHenjin	hehehehehe :)
2011-06-16T12:56:00.000Z	DJHenjin		and i need to keep my emc2 config for my machine because its a custom built machine and i cant remember the pinout
2011-06-16T12:57:00.000Z	strata_	DJHenjin	yea. you have older hardware. doing dist upgrades can be fatal :)
2011-06-16T12:57:00.000Z	DJHenjin		not the computer... the bloody machine EMC2 is for controlling
2011-06-16T12:58:00.000Z	DJHenjin	iszak	plug the network cable in?
2011-06-16T12:58:00.000Z	DJHenjin		lol
2011-06-16T12:58:00.000Z	strata_	DJHenjin	well. if it's a video prob, try hitting ctrl-alt-f1 repeatedly while you are booting i suppose
2011-06-16T12:58:00.000Z	DJHenjin		tried that
2011-06-16T12:59:00.000Z	DJHenjin		no dice
2011-06-16T12:59:00.000Z	strata_	DJHenjin	can you get your data off the machine?
2011-06-16T12:59:00.000Z	DJHenjin		not easily
2011-06-16T12:59:00.000Z	strata_	DJHenjin	sounds like it's hosed :(
