2008-02-10T10:16:00.000Z	thiemster		can i dual boot windows 2000 (dell edition) with my already installed Ubuntu 7.10?
2008-02-10T10:16:00.000Z	chubs730	thiemster	yes
2008-02-10T10:17:00.000Z	thiemster	chubs730	how?
2008-02-10T10:17:00.000Z	thiemster	chubs730	I tried it once and the windows 2000 installation failed
2008-02-10T10:17:00.000Z	chubs730	thiemster	you'll have to partition beforehand in linux, using gparted
2008-02-10T10:17:00.000Z	thiemster	chubs730	you mean with the gparted livecd?
2008-02-10T10:18:00.000Z	chubs730	thiemster	you'll most likely have to use the livecd yes
2008-02-10T10:18:00.000Z	thiemster	chubs730	after i partition, do i just install windows 2000 the normal way?
2008-02-10T10:18:00.000Z	chubs730	thiemster	shrink your linux partition and format it to ntfs, and windows 2000 should recognize it and install
2008-02-10T10:18:00.000Z	thiemster	chubs730	is there anyway to do it without deleting all my linux stuff?
2008-02-10T10:18:00.000Z	chubs730	thiemster	and then you'll have to use the ubuntu livecd to rebuild grub, but that's fairly easy
2008-02-10T10:19:00.000Z	chubs730	thiemster	yes, gparted will automatically do that for you, it shows you what you've used and you can just drag the space smaller
2008-02-10T10:19:00.000Z	chubs730	thiemster	unless you've used up almost all your disk space
2008-02-10T10:19:00.000Z	thiemster	chubs730	nope, i haven't used up the space. i still have about 50 gigabytes left
2008-02-10T10:20:00.000Z	thiemster	chubs730	and that's more than enough for windows 2000. it's a pretty small installation
2008-02-10T10:20:00.000Z	thiemster	chubs730	thanks for your advice, i'll try it again one of these days
2008-02-10T10:20:00.000Z	chubs730	thiemster	yeah that'll be fine then, just boot into gparted, shrink your ext2 or ext3 or whatever you're using for ubuntu, and then format the blank space as ntfs
2008-02-10T10:20:00.000Z	chubs730	thiemster	no problem
