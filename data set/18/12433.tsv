2007-04-08T15:33:00.000Z	gharz	rambo3	ok. thanks for the info. i'll check that
2007-04-08T15:35:00.000Z	gharz	rambo3	i have a problem... my login window is showing xubuntu (which i have removed already)... how to i change it? i can't find it in System->Preferences.
2007-04-08T15:36:00.000Z	rambo3	gharz	? explain
2007-04-08T15:37:00.000Z	gharz	rambo3	remember we login first (enter username and password) so we can start using ubuntu? in that login window the xubuntu login window appears... which should have been ubuntu. i've just upgraded my ubuntu to feisty and i can't find that option to change the login window.
2007-04-08T15:38:00.000Z	rambo3	gharz	if you want other login windows type :  sudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm
2007-04-08T15:38:00.000Z	gharz	rambo3	ok thanks. i'll try that
2007-04-08T15:39:00.000Z	rambo3	gharz	if you dont have install gdm and gdmsetup
2007-04-08T15:39:00.000Z	gharz	rambo3	what do u mean?
2007-04-08T15:40:00.000Z	gharz	rambo3	previously when i was using 6.10 i installed xfce4... then i removed it. but whenever i start ubuntu... xubuntu login window appears. i've just updated to feisty last night.
2007-04-08T15:41:00.000Z	gharz	rambo3	thanks!
2007-04-10T14:13:00.000Z	rambo3	gharz	i think its connect to first open wireless network available
2007-04-10T14:14:00.000Z	gharz	rambo3	actually that's my problem. i created a profile to connect to my network... but whenever i start my machine it connects to another network.
2007-04-10T14:14:00.000Z	rambo3	gharz	then disable it
2007-04-10T14:15:00.000Z	gharz	rambo3	i untick it already... but it still connecting to another network... i'm currently running feisty which i just upgraded. it wasn't like this in edgy.
2007-04-10T14:15:00.000Z	rambo3	gharz	no its the import from "Vista"
