2006-11-30T06:53:00.000Z	zied		i have a question regarding java i have installed JDK1.5 on my computer, java 1.4 is installed by default, i am using a program compatible only with 1.5 version and i cannot get rid of 1.4 any help thx
2006-11-30T06:54:00.000Z	Flannel	zied	why can't you uninstall 1.4?
2006-11-30T06:56:00.000Z	Flannel	zied	alright, that means you don't know how, not you can't.  It's a big difference.  Which version of ubuntu are you using?  And, java isn't installed by default, so, how did you install it?
2006-11-30T06:56:00.000Z	zied	Flannel	 i am using edgy
2006-11-30T06:57:00.000Z	zied	Flannel	 okey , mau be be coz i have installed eclipse
2006-11-30T07:01:00.000Z	Flannel	zied	eclipse won't install java (although, it won't work without it), I.. don't think it's possible to install java1.4 from package management, in edgy.  How did you install it?
2006-11-30T07:04:00.000Z	zied	Flannel	 i have already downloaded java 1.5 form IBM website installed it and i assigned a path in /etc/profile file when i type java-version i find java version "1.4.2"
2006-11-30T07:04:00.000Z	Flannel	zied	ah, you don't have suns java.  ok.  Follow this,
2006-11-30T07:07:00.000Z	zied	Flannel	thank you are there any differences betweend the sun release and IBM release ?
2006-11-30T07:07:00.000Z	Flannel	zied	Just use the one in the repositories.  That way it'll get bugfixes and security fixes automatically
2006-11-30T07:08:00.000Z	zied	Flannel	ok thx man
2006-11-30T08:04:00.000Z	zied	Flannel	hi its me again, i am facing another problem, i have an application that launch javac command and i cannot find that on sun java
2006-11-30T08:25:00.000Z	Flannel	zied	did you install sun java from the repositories?
2006-11-30T08:29:00.000Z	zied	Flannel	 yas I did, i am working on a project i need the command javac, this means that i have to install java SDK then  i have to make a path to the same directory as java, i am running on project which has a classpath compatible with ibm java
2006-11-30T08:35:00.000Z	Flannel	zied	Installing the deb will set up all the path stuff for you, including javac.
2006-11-30T08:37:00.000Z	zied	Flannel	Flannel  if i need only jdk tools from ibm is that okey ?
2006-11-30T08:37:00.000Z	Flannel	zied	it'll install sun's java.  I have no idea if IBMs libraries are compatable
2006-11-30T08:38:00.000Z	zied	Flannel	thank you again
