2007-12-01T22:17:00.000Z	Velcro_MM		thx Javid
2007-12-01T22:18:00.000Z	Velcro_MM		my laptop is 400 MHz Dell Latitude, running Ubuntu 5 Breezy Badger. Will installing a late Ubuntu slow it down a lot?
2007-12-01T22:18:00.000Z	Velcro_MM		later
2007-12-01T22:18:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Velcro_MM	i'd go w/ xubuntu 7.10
2007-12-01T22:19:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Velcro_MM	how much RAM?
2007-12-01T22:19:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Velcro_MM	hm, you may need to go Flux..
2007-12-01T22:28:00.000Z	Velcro_MM	IndyGunFreak	I have 256 megs RAm on that Dell Latitude at 400 MHz.
2007-12-01T22:28:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Velcro_MM	ok, that should be enough.... you may end up using the alternate install CD, but i think it should be ok w/ the Live CD
2007-12-01T22:32:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Velcro_MM	yes, you should be able to run Xubuntu fine, like i said, you may need to use the alternate install CD, and as for playing media files, etc, provided you have the proper codecs, you should have no prob.
2007-12-01T22:33:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Velcro_MM	have you ever used Xfce Desktop, or Linux?
2007-12-01T22:33:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Velcro_MM	lol, well you'll probably needa bit more than that.
2007-12-01T22:34:00.000Z	Velcro_MM	IndyGunFreak	I have had Ubuntu with whatever it is, KDE, on this laptop for a year or so, but I don't use it except now and then and while traveling for browsing (via Firefox)
2007-12-01T22:35:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Velcro_MM	ok, s you likely have a basic understanding.... but KDE will bog that old machine down.
2007-12-01T22:35:00.000Z	Velcro_MM	IndyGunFreak	it's been just a bit sluggish, but acceptable
2007-12-01T22:36:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Velcro_MM	yes, but if youu intend to upgrade, Feisty or Gutsy will cripple it.
2007-12-01T22:39:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Velcro_MM	yes, but not as user friendly if you ask me.
2007-12-01T22:40:00.000Z	Velcro_MM	IndyGunFreak	well user-friendliness is important to me, so maybe I'll go with Xubuntu
2007-12-01T22:40:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Velcro_MM	thats obvioiusly open to opinion, i like Flux, but i don't find it as user friendly as xfce/gnome
