2007-10-19T23:46:00.000Z	akorn		Can you upgrade to 7.10 using the CD instead of doing it through Updates?
2007-10-19T23:46:00.000Z	gerro	akorn	I had 7.10 pre release and have updated from that but it seems my repository is broken :/
2007-10-19T23:47:00.000Z	gerro	akorn	I got tribe 5 to do initial install
2007-10-19T23:47:00.000Z	akorn	gerro	Yea my repos are messed up, so i downlaoded the CD instead and was wondering if you can upgrdae through that rather than through repos
2007-10-19T23:50:00.000Z	gerro	akorn	what are the repos on the current gutsy 7.10 cd?
2007-10-19T23:50:00.000Z	akorn	gerro	How do i check that?
2008-01-10T14:31:00.000Z	gerro	akorn	because compiz relies on emerald for window management
2008-01-10T14:31:00.000Z	gerro	akorn	try alt + click to move them until you setup emeraldd
2008-01-10T14:32:00.000Z	akorn	gerro	it won't let me install emerald, says i'm missing repos...what repos do i have to add? i don't remmeber ever adding any...
2008-01-10T14:32:00.000Z	gerro	akorn	alt + click always works, something's seriously broke if it doesn't. Is your machine completely locked up?
2008-01-10T14:33:00.000Z	akorn	gerro	everything works perfectly except for being able to move windows...however, if i disable compiz i CAN move windows (with alt click or by dragging them with the top bar)
2008-01-10T14:33:00.000Z	gerro	akorn	try checking /etc/apt/sources.list and uncomment the repository where emerald would be
2008-01-10T14:34:00.000Z	akorn	gerro	everything works perfectly except for being able to move windows...however, if i disable compiz i CAN move windows (with alt click or by dragging them with the top bar)
2008-01-10T14:35:00.000Z	gerro	akorn	perhaps your missing something in xorg?
2008-01-10T14:37:00.000Z	akorn	gerro	i'll try completely removing all compiz crap and reinstalling it completely
2008-01-10T14:37:00.000Z	akorn	gerro	do you konw what repo emerald themes are downloaded from and all their dependencies? b/c it won't let me download
2008-01-10T14:38:00.000Z	gerro	akorn	try gnome-looks site its pretty good
2008-01-10T14:38:00.000Z	akorn	gerro	okay thanks
