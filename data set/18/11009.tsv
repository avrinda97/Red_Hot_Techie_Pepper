2007-06-17T13:04:00.000Z	xst		When kubuntu is installed for the first time, an xorg.conf file is automatically generated. How can I regenerate this after the install? (I want to completely display reset all changes I have made)
2007-06-17T13:04:00.000Z	wols_	xst	dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2007-06-17T13:06:00.000Z	xst	wols_	this asks me a whole bunch of questions. The installer could deduce all of it automatically. I don't want to make any wrong configurations so can I somehow make it re-generate the xorg.conf file automatically?
2007-06-17T13:07:00.000Z	wols_	xst	don#t know of a way
2007-06-17T13:15:00.000Z	wols_	xst	apt-cache policy kde-guidance
2007-06-17T13:16:00.000Z	xst	wols_	It outputs something. Not sure what to do
2007-06-17T13:28:00.000Z	wols_	xst	you should paste what it outputs
2007-06-17T13:28:00.000Z	xst	wols_	It outputs "Reinstallation of kde-guidance is not possible, it cannot be downloaded."
2007-06-17T13:29:00.000Z	wols_	xst	that is not wzhat it outputs. read my question again and this time do what I asked you
2007-06-17T13:29:00.000Z	xst	wols_	What is "it"?
2007-06-17T13:29:00.000Z	wols_	xst	read my question
2007-06-17T13:30:00.000Z	wols_	xst	21:15
2007-06-17T13:32:00.000Z	xst	wols_	You asked me about apt-cache policy kde-guidance if I remember correctly but you never answered when I asked about how to interpret the output. The output lists the local .deb-file as first priority and the repository as second.
2007-06-17T13:32:00.000Z	wols_	xst	21:28 < wols_> xst: you should paste what it outputs
2007-06-17T13:35:00.000Z	xst	wols_	http://nopaste.org/p/aaXMojWMC
2007-06-17T13:37:00.000Z	wols_	xst	is kde-guidance still in /var/cache/apt/archives/ ?
2007-06-17T13:38:00.000Z	xst	wols_	Nope
2007-06-17T13:38:00.000Z	wols_	xst	download it from packages.ubuntu.com, install it via dpkg -i
