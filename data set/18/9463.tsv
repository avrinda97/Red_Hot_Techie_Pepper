There should be at the end some options like "quiet splash"    add there noacpi    and then save the file
2007-04-11T07:14:00.000Z	Epic720		thanks genii, I will try that
2007-04-11T07:14:00.000Z	genii	Epic720	 :)
2007-04-11T07:16:00.000Z	Epic720	genii	I see a quiet, but no quiet splash. Can I add 'noacpi' to anywhere under that line?
2007-04-11T07:17:00.000Z	genii	Epic720	No, add it on the same line, at the end
2007-04-11T07:17:00.000Z	Epic720		ok
2007-04-11T07:24:00.000Z	Epic720	genii	I added that line and the sound won't reside. I went to shut down and the sound was then constant all the way until I logged in again....
2007-04-11T07:25:00.000Z	genii	Epic720	Then likely the acpi is not the core problem.
2007-04-11T07:26:00.000Z	Epic720	genii	I searched the forums and I can't seem to find a different solution. Any ideas?
2007-04-11T07:28:00.000Z	genii	Epic720	Well, an unlikely possibility is an interrupt conflict. If possible to change the irq the soundcard uses to something no other device has, that would show. If the prob goes, that was it. If not, it's some other issue.
2007-04-11T07:29:00.000Z	Epic720	genii	a couple of days ago I switched the sound card to a different PCI slot, could that rule out the interrupt scenario?
2007-04-11T07:30:00.000Z	genii	Epic720	No, since it prefers to have a default set of resources. No matter what slot you use it will always want to grab irq# address ####-####   etc
2007-04-11T07:31:00.000Z	genii	Epic720	I normally disable my printerport and use irq 7 or 5 when possible, isolated for the soundcard
2007-04-11T07:32:00.000Z	Epic720	genii	how would I go about doing that?
2007-04-11T07:33:00.000Z	genii	Epic720	Well, you can go to the Control Panel or so, examine what resources things are using. If you have for instance a printerport you don't use, then in bios you could disable it. Most soundcards will take irq 5 or 7 if it's free first before going to some shared irq like 9 or 10 etc
2007-04-11T07:34:00.000Z	Epic720	genii	thanks, I will try that
2007-04-11T07:35:00.000Z	genii	Epic720	 Hope it works
2007-04-11T07:35:00.000Z	genii	Epic720	If you also know the module name, you can put it in /etc/modules with parameters like what irq to use
