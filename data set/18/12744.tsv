2006-12-27T09:13:00.000Z	Answer		Hello.  I have a strange problem fixing ssh without a password.  It had been working but now always asks for a password.  I have regenerated and setup authorized_keys but the server will not accept keys from any client, it just asks for a password.  Anybody familiar with ssh keys?
2006-12-27T09:14:00.000Z	kitche	Answer	it seems like the server is setup to just use password or something
2006-12-27T09:15:00.000Z	Answer	kitche	yes I have tried setting it to use keys with sshd_config, and I can see in -vvv that it does ssh_key_exchange etc
2006-12-27T09:15:00.000Z	kitche	Answer	or the sshd is setup to use keys with password that's how I have mine set up actually
2006-12-27T09:16:00.000Z	Answer	kitche	ok yes the sshd_config was very confusing...
2006-12-27T09:26:00.000Z	kitche	Answer	did you restart sshd also?
2006-12-27T09:27:00.000Z	Answer	kitche	/etc/init.d/ssh restart ?  I also rebooted the machine
2006-12-27T09:50:00.000Z	kitche	Answer	you sure it's not your key passphrase it's asking for?
2006-12-27T09:51:00.000Z	Answer	kitche	I regenerated the keys and hit enter when prompted for hte passphrase.  could the sshd_config force to ask for password?
2006-12-27T09:51:00.000Z	kitche	Answer	it might be asking for the passphrase what does it say when you try to ssh in does it ask for username then password or just ask for password?
2006-12-27T09:52:00.000Z	Answer	kitche	just password
2006-12-27T09:52:00.000Z	kitche	Answer	then it's asking for your passphrase password probably
2006-12-27T09:54:00.000Z	kitche	Answer	did you make a passphrase when you made those keys?
2006-12-27T09:55:00.000Z	Answer	kitche	no I hit enter for a blank passphrase
