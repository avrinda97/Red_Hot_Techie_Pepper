2007-01-23T06:29:00.000Z	jrattner		Is there anyway to protect my internet usage in general?
2007-01-23T06:30:00.000Z	LjL	jrattner	no. if the application protocol you're using doesn't support encryption, there's no way to use encryption. if you have a second machine available, and that one is trusted (meaning, its network provider is - somewhat), you can tunnel through that machine
2007-01-23T06:31:00.000Z	jrattner	LjL	so there is no reliable way to encrypt or protect communications between my laptop and the outside world while on my university network?
2007-01-23T06:31:00.000Z	jrattner	LjL	unless its a protected protocol
2007-01-23T06:32:00.000Z	LjL	jrattner	correct
2007-01-23T06:34:00.000Z	LjL	jrattner	encrypt it. but you'll have to decrypt before using
2007-01-23T06:34:00.000Z	jrattner	LjL	poop this day is going well : )
2007-01-23T06:34:00.000Z	LjL	jrattner	however, if that's still your university computer, and you might have reason to believe that you're being keylogged, that will be of little use
2007-01-23T06:35:00.000Z	jrattner	LjL	are then legal issues surrounding the idea of them keylogging me accross the network
2007-01-23T06:36:00.000Z	LjL	jrattner	i have no idea, and even if i had, it probably wouldn't apply since i don't believe we're in the same country
2007-01-23T06:36:00.000Z	jrattner	LjL	hehe alright thanks for the help
2007-01-23T06:37:00.000Z	LjL	jrattner	actually, there is a way now that i think of it. it's called tor -- it's still (very refined) tunnelling to a proxy machine, but the proxy doesn't have to be provided by you. i'm pretty sure it encrypts
2007-01-23T06:37:00.000Z	LjL	jrattner	still a determined administrator *will* be able to sniff your packets if they have access to your machine
2007-01-23T06:38:00.000Z	LjL	jrattner	i also strongly recommend against using tor for any kind of high-bandwidth transfers
2007-01-23T06:38:00.000Z	jrattner	LjL	yeh...i wonder about the admins here though, I seem to have the ability to sniff the network for anything
2007-01-23T06:38:00.000Z	jrattner	LjL	do u have a URL to tor
2007-01-23T06:39:00.000Z	LjL	jrattner	as for the url, http://tor.eff.org/
2007-01-23T06:41:00.000Z	LjL	jrattner	i suggest typing "apt-cache search packet sniff" if you have Universe enabled, otherwise enable it or search on http://packages.ubuntu.com
