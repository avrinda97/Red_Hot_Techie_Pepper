2006-07-11T14:27:00.000Z	SanketMedhi	zambaroo	sudo ifdown eth0
2006-07-11T14:29:00.000Z	zambaroo	SanketMedhi	please hehe, i am root
2006-07-11T14:30:00.000Z	SanketMedhi	zambaroo	what? sorry I lost track
2006-07-11T14:31:00.000Z	zambaroo	SanketMedhi	ifdown eth0 tells me the device is not configured, which is not true. it is configured and is up.
2006-07-11T14:31:00.000Z	SanketMedhi	zambaroo	why do you want to do that anyway?
2006-07-11T14:31:00.000Z	SanketMedhi	zambaroo	Go to System >> Networking. Click on eth0. Deactivate!
2006-07-11T14:31:00.000Z	zambaroo	SanketMedhi	it's invoked by xen scripts and breaks them because it doesnt return
2006-07-11T14:32:00.000Z	zambaroo	SanketMedhi	running in console.
2006-07-11T14:33:00.000Z	SanketMedhi	zambaroo	I would love to try that but I am accessing the internet on eth0 :P
2006-07-11T14:34:00.000Z	SanketMedhi	zambaroo	do you have any more interfaces, eg. eth1?
2006-07-11T14:40:00.000Z	SanketMedhi	zambaroo	?
2006-07-11T14:41:00.000Z	zambaroo	SanketMedhi	it's in the datacenter, now i have to go there.. /etc/init.d/networking restart did not come back.
2006-07-11T14:41:00.000Z	SanketMedhi	zambaroo	do you have a route configured manually?
2006-07-11T14:42:00.000Z	zambaroo	SanketMedhi	yes
2006-07-11T14:42:00.000Z	SanketMedhi	zambaroo	remove it and then try
2006-07-11T14:42:00.000Z	zambaroo	SanketMedhi	im going down there now, will try.
