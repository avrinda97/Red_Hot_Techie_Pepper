2012-10-01T04:21:00.000Z	recursive_		After some panic set it, I checked hacker keyboard's permissions in android.  not foolproof, but at least it doesn't have internet access.
2012-10-01T04:21:00.000Z	recursive_		*set in
2012-10-01T04:23:00.000Z	recursive_		frankly I'd shoot for a more stable network connection if possible
2012-10-01T04:23:00.000Z	recursive_		I've had good success over short distances with ethernet over powerline adapters in cases where I can't string network cables
2012-10-01T04:24:00.000Z	recursive_		yeah.  it looks like a big powerbrick / AC adapter, but its got an ethernet port in it
2012-10-01T04:24:00.000Z	recursive_		you get a pair, and they effectively bridge the two ends like you'd run a cable through
2012-10-01T04:25:00.000Z	recursive_		I have a relatively old / electrically noisy house, but it does work for short distances.   not perfect, but better than wifi for short distances
2012-10-01T04:25:00.000Z	recursive_		yes
2012-10-01T04:26:00.000Z	recursive_		I run cable as far as I can go, then drop one of those near the obstruction (chimney in my house)
2012-10-01T04:26:00.000Z	recursive_		then place the second as close as I can, and then add more ethernet
2012-10-01T04:26:00.000Z	gogeta	recursive_	naa i goot direncinal wifi system owns anything else
2012-10-01T04:40:00.000Z	gogeta	recursive_	i had one reset everytime the wind blew lol
2012-10-01T04:40:00.000Z	gogeta	recursive_	litterly
2012-10-01T05:33:00.000Z	gogeta	recursive_	yep ill wait for the nativ sloution
2012-10-01T05:33:00.000Z	recursive_	gogeta	 I'm hoping that comes soon.  There's work on a native X server for android.
2012-10-01T05:34:00.000Z	recursive_	gogeta	so at least graphics wouldn't be so incredibly painful.  the chroot thing does have the perk of not requiring bootloader changes, or reboots.
2012-10-01T05:36:00.000Z	gogeta	recursive_	well if they manage to make it work something like wubi
2012-10-01T05:36:00.000Z	gogeta	recursive_	that will be plenty good enough
