2008-01-29T18:15:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	unop	don_andrez sluggo All hail the mighty sluggo... his command returned`CONFIG_VMI=y' Thanks sluggo. That should answer don_andrez question.
2008-01-29T20:08:00.000Z	unop	ArthurArchnix	again, i'm not sure how vbox really works - so i cant say for sure how to remedy it, maybe the official way to get it working properly is to reboot, but then i'd say it wasn't written properly :)
2008-01-29T20:09:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	unop	see above.
2008-01-29T20:10:00.000Z	unop	ArthurArchnix	thats weird
2008-01-29T20:10:00.000Z	unop	ArthurArchnix	you've probably found a bug, you might like to report it
2008-01-29T20:11:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	unop	perhaps. But it doesn't take away from your larger point, that I restart too often :)
2008-01-29T20:13:00.000Z	unop	ArthurArchnix	I usually only reboot my machine if i want to add hardware to it or do a kernel upgrade - but then again, i dont run much exotic software
2008-05-03T12:44:00.000Z	unop	ArthurArchnix	the best way to do this is to use gpg with your mail client .. what you essentially do is encrypt the file using the other person's public key, the only person in the world then able to decrypt the file is that person, using his private key ... but this requires he use pgp/gpg too
2008-05-03T12:45:00.000Z	unop	ArthurArchnix	another way is to use something like openssl to encrypt the file using a passphrase, but the other person needs to have openssl installed too
2008-05-03T12:45:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	unop	well, when I right-click on the file and choose encrypt... how is that different from openssl
2008-05-03T12:46:00.000Z	unop	ArthurArchnix	i'm not really sure what that does, i don't use gnome .. i'd imagine it used openssl, but i can't be sure
2008-05-03T12:46:00.000Z	unop	ArthurArchnix	are you prompted for a password/passphrase when you choose that option?
2008-05-03T12:46:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	unop	ok
2008-05-03T12:47:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	unop	Hmm... no I'm prompted for a recipient, but the list is empty.
2008-05-03T12:48:00.000Z	unop	ArthurArchnix	hrrm, not sure then, you need to get someone who knows gnome to help you out there.
2008-05-03T12:49:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	unop	astro76 thanks though
2008-05-03T12:49:00.000Z	unop	ArthurArchnix	maybe the documentation on gnome.org helps?
