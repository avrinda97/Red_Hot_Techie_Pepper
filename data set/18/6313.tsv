2008-05-24T22:08:00.000Z	[TiZ]		Hello? I'm getting ready to move my Wubi install to its own partition. I've been deleting stuff from my 134GB data partition in preparation. It has 28% of its space free now, and I've defragmented it several times. But I can't get data to move away from the end of the partition. Is it safe to resize the partition anyway?
2008-05-24T22:09:00.000Z	anirudh1	[TiZ]	no
2008-05-24T22:11:00.000Z	anirudh1	[TiZ]	maybe you could defrag...whats the filesystem type fat16 or fat32?
2008-05-24T22:12:00.000Z	[TiZ]	anirudh1	I've been defragging several times. It's a fat32 filesystem, and I've been using AusLogics Disk Defrag.
2008-05-24T22:13:00.000Z	anirudh1	[TiZ]	hmm...do you have a backup on another partition
2008-05-24T22:13:00.000Z	[TiZ]	anirudh1	No, unfortunately. I have a laptop with a 160GB hard drive.
2008-05-24T22:14:00.000Z	[TiZ]	anirudh1	I gave 15GB to Windows XP and 134GB to other data.
2008-05-24T22:15:00.000Z	anirudh1	[TiZ]	the wubi thing is how big exactly...never used it myself so do not know
2008-05-24T22:16:00.000Z	[TiZ]	anirudh1	my Wubi install is 8GB. It's split across 3 disks: a swap one that's just under 1GB, and two others that are under 4 and 3GB.
2008-05-24T22:16:00.000Z	[TiZ]	anirudh1	they're virtual disks, by the way
2008-05-24T22:18:00.000Z	anirudh1	[TiZ]	cant think of any straighforward way for you...guess its easiest to just use partition magic..that should minimize the risk involved
2008-05-24T22:18:00.000Z	[TiZ]	anirudh1	I have the GParted LiveCD. Is that better or worse than Partition Magic?
2008-05-24T22:24:00.000Z	anirudh1	[TiZ]	that would be easier
2008-05-24T22:34:00.000Z	anirudh1	[TiZ]	still dont understand why you want wubi...why not do a simple fresh install
2008-05-24T22:35:00.000Z	[TiZ]	anirudh1	I want to keep the stuff I've done to it. Like wireless drivers. They were a pain in the butt to set up.
2008-05-24T22:35:00.000Z	[TiZ]	anirudh1	and besides, even if I did a fresh install, I'd face the same partitioning problems.
2008-05-24T22:36:00.000Z	anirudh1	[TiZ]	yes..true
2008-05-24T22:41:00.000Z	anirudh1	[TiZ]	kde apps work in gnome
