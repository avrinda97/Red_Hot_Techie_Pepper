2007-05-20T14:46:00.000Z	zoidberg		anyone know of a good torent client for ubuntu?
2007-05-20T14:47:00.000Z	Waddledee	zoidberg	I like Azureus, but the version that ships with ubuntu is glitchy.  It's fixable, though.
2007-05-20T14:47:00.000Z	zoidberg	Waddledee	how is it fixable
2007-05-20T14:47:00.000Z	zoidberg	Waddledee	i used to use azureus on ubuntu but it always ackted funny
2007-05-20T14:49:00.000Z	zoidberg	Waddledee	do u know how to make the fixes on azureus so it works right?
2007-05-20T14:49:00.000Z	zoidberg	Waddledee	u there
2007-05-20T14:50:00.000Z	Waddledee	zoidberg	yeah, I'm here, sorry.  Working on other stuff.
2007-05-20T14:51:00.000Z	zoidberg	Waddledee	you think you could help me out with azureus
2007-05-20T14:51:00.000Z	Waddledee		And the fix is to replace the .jar file of Azureus with the newest one from the official site.  How exactly to do that I forget-- someone else walked me through it-- but I can probably figure it out if no one else can help.
2007-05-20T14:53:00.000Z	Waddledee	zoidberg	okay, I found the info.  You ready?
2007-05-20T14:54:00.000Z	Waddledee	zoidberg	*pokes*
2007-05-20T14:58:00.000Z	zoidberg	Waddledee	i'm ready
2007-05-20T14:59:00.000Z	Waddledee	zoidberg	okay, first download the latest .jar file for Azureus from the official site.
2007-05-20T15:00:00.000Z	Waddledee	zoidberg	second, install Azureus through the Add/Remove menu, if you haven't already.  Let me know when you've done both.
2007-05-20T15:01:00.000Z	zoidberg	Waddledee	i downloaded azureus through apt-get in the terminal....now you want me to download the .jar file from the azureus website?
2007-05-20T15:01:00.000Z	Waddledee	zoidberg	yes.  You're going to replace the .jar file from Ubuntu's installation with the latest one from Azureus.
