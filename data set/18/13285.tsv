2006-01-04T16:17:00.000Z	sanjay	Renich	its free, and it works beautifully -- something i could setup even for my mom and know she'll be able to use .. and the IRC support is great for any complex issues ..
2006-01-04T16:17:00.000Z	Renich	bob832	I'm looking for other kind of reasons... like, uptodate software, great filesystem usage, standard compilance, etc
2006-01-04T16:18:00.000Z	Renich		ok, anyone used Fedora Core here?
2006-01-04T16:18:00.000Z	Renich		any comparisson notes?
2006-01-04T16:19:00.000Z	sanjay	Renich	standard compliance is the only issue i think, for eg. setting up my wireless card is still a bitch, but thats getting better .
2006-01-04T16:19:00.000Z	Renich		what about the standard directory hierarchy?
2006-01-04T16:20:00.000Z	Renich		ok, thanx guys for the input... so far the veredict is that ubuntu is more beautiful than anything... right?
2006-01-04T16:20:00.000Z	sanjay	Renich	ext3, standard linux i think -- uses /etc , /var, /home , /boot, etc ..
