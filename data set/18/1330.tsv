2011-05-19T03:33:00.000Z	merryman540		Ok I'll upgrade and be damned ha ha ha ha. Thanks.
2011-05-19T03:33:00.000Z	merryman540		escott- ok thank you
2011-05-19T03:35:00.000Z	merryman540		Can anyone tell a quick way to solve this please: E: Malformed line 64 in source list /etc/apt/sources.list (dist parse)
2011-05-19T03:36:00.000Z	merryman540		I'm fairly sure there aren't 64 lines
2011-05-19T03:38:00.000Z	merryman540		E:Malformed line 64 in source list /etc/apt/sources.list (dist parse), E:The list of sources could not be read.'
2011-05-19T03:38:00.000Z	KM0201	merryman540	you didn't put that line in your source list correctly... pastebin /etc/apt/sources.list
2011-05-19T03:46:00.000Z	KM0201	merryman540	have you tried removing 64?
2011-05-19T03:47:00.000Z	KM0201	merryman540	can y[ou not see the numbers on the side?
2011-05-19T03:47:00.000Z	KM0201	merryman540	if i had to guess, its probably line 66... but thats just a guess...
2011-05-19T03:48:00.000Z	KM0201	merryman540	you're gonna have a couple extra lines because of the way you copy/pasted that... so im' guessing its line 66
2011-05-19T03:49:00.000Z	merryman540	KM0201	-so how do I disable them? # something is it?
2011-05-19T03:49:00.000Z	KM0201	merryman540	honestly, i would just delete it.. rather than disable it.
2011-05-19T03:50:00.000Z	KM0201	merryman540	there's no reason to comment it out, as its not in there properly as it is, so its useless
2011-05-19T03:51:00.000Z	KM0201	merryman540	no, apt-get update, just updates your source list after you've made changes to it.. what exactly are you tryin to do?
2011-05-19T03:58:00.000Z	merryman540	KM0201	& escott - thanks for your help bye
