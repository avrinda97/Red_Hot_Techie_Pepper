2005-09-15T16:26:00.000Z	Seveas	ilpavox	what is the name of the debfile alien created? <---
2005-09-15T16:27:00.000Z	Seveas	ilpavox	no, it should have created a .deb file
2005-09-15T16:28:00.000Z	Seveas	ilpavox	did you use alien -i?
2005-09-15T16:29:00.000Z	Seveas	ilpavox	and after that dpkg -i thing.deb?
2005-09-15T16:29:00.000Z	Seveas	ilpavox	then you did not install it :)
2005-09-15T16:30:00.000Z	Seveas	ilpavox	grab a .deb file from seveas.ubuntulinux.nl
2005-09-15T06:15:00.000Z	Seveas	ilpavox	?
2005-09-15T06:16:00.000Z	Seveas	ilpavox	please do
2005-09-18T15:58:00.000Z	Seveas	ilpavox	hoary-extras should work :)
2005-09-19T16:04:00.000Z	Seveas	ilpavox	sun-j2re1.5_1.5.0+update04_i386.deb
2006-03-03T07:20:00.000Z	Seveas	ilpavox	do you get errors about that file?
2006-03-03T07:23:00.000Z	Seveas	ilpavox	the file you are asking for is in no package - it is part of glibc and the name only exists during compiling of glibc.
2006-03-03T07:24:00.000Z	Seveas	ilpavox	put the complete output on the pastebin and maybe I can say something more useful
2006-03-03T07:28:00.000Z	Seveas	ilpavox	apt-get install build-essential - as said by the Compiing wikipage...
