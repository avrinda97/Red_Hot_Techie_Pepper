2011-10-16T11:38:00.000Z	dr_willis	StepNjump	 depeneds on your ram. if swap will ever get used. :) in the old days yea. you could gain some speed by having swap on a differnt drive.  I used to put a little swap parittion on ever hd in the system. for even more gain
2011-10-16T11:38:00.000Z	dr_willis	StepNjump	 but these days. it most likely wont be noticeable  unless you have a real low end syste,
2011-10-16T11:39:00.000Z	StepNjump	dr_willis	since I have those two hard drives, I figured, may as well use them both
2011-10-16T11:41:00.000Z	StepNjump	dr_willis	what about if I had / on a different physical drive and had home on a different one too.. would that help you think?
2011-10-16T11:41:00.000Z	dr_willis	StepNjump	 dosent hurt. :)
2011-10-16T11:42:00.000Z	dr_willis	StepNjump	 you could even split up home so some users are on hd1 an dothers on hd2 if you wanted to
2011-10-16T11:44:00.000Z	StepNjump	dr_willis	so you have your home directory on a conventionnal hard drive then?
2011-10-16T11:44:00.000Z	dr_willis	StepNjump	 my whole system is on a 32gb usb flash drive.
2011-10-16T11:44:00.000Z	dr_willis	StepNjump	 i dident want to mess with the partitons on this new pc. :)
2011-10-16T11:46:00.000Z	dr_willis	StepNjump	 never really counted..   bios post/messages and grub timeout is longer then boot time
2011-10-16T12:00:00.000Z	StepNjump	dr_willis	what do you mean .map?
2011-11-22T11:15:00.000Z	dr_willis	StepNjump	 theres a wine submenu item. or look in the wine dir.
2011-11-22T11:19:00.000Z	StepNjump	dr_willis	I found the dir however I click the exe and nothing happens
2011-11-22T11:19:00.000Z	dr_willis	StepNjump	 use the cli to laumch it so you can see errors
2011-11-22T11:20:00.000Z	dr_willis	StepNjump	 the terminal..  wine /path/to/the/foo.exe
2011-11-22T11:25:00.000Z	StepNjump	dr_willis	bash: cd: Program: No such file or directory
