2012-06-27T00:56:00.000Z	hopeless8009	OerHeks	says to run sudo apt-get install -f
2012-06-27T00:57:00.000Z	hopeless8009	OerHeks	but it woun't run says it cant find some derectors
2012-06-27T00:58:00.000Z	OerHeks	hopeless8009	copy that to paste.ubuntu.com and give us the url
2012-06-27T01:00:00.000Z	hopeless8009	OerHeks	http://paste.ubuntu.com/1061544/
2012-06-27T01:01:00.000Z	OerHeks	hopeless8009	with terminal open, did you close software centre? only one program can use the softwaresource.
2012-06-27T01:02:00.000Z	hopeless8009	OerHeks	well i relized that i had it open then shut it and run it again but still returned same error
2012-06-27T01:02:00.000Z	hopeless8009	OerHeks	should i reboot system?
2012-06-27T01:04:00.000Z	hopeless8009	OerHeks	oh and i think my softwar install program my be stuck running
2012-06-27T01:04:00.000Z	OerHeks	hopeless8009	maybe this is a solution :
2012-06-27T01:09:00.000Z	hopeless8009	OerHeks	I rebooted and ran that command and it told me to run sudo dpkg --configure -a
2012-06-27T01:09:00.000Z	hopeless8009	OerHeks	it looks like its doing something
2012-06-27T01:10:00.000Z	hopeless8009	OerHeks	was that a good thing to do?
2012-06-27T01:12:00.000Z	OerHeks	hopeless8009	yes, now check if sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade works normal
2012-06-27T01:13:00.000Z	hopeless8009	OerHeks	the command i ran last is hanging at 99%
2012-06-27T01:22:00.000Z	hopeless8009	OerHeks	you there?
