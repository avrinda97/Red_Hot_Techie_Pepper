2005-03-04T07:39:00.000Z	Frederick	arbeck	where are you stuck? I mean cant you mount? Read? Copy? Explain your problem better
2005-03-04T07:40:00.000Z	arbeck	Frederick	I right click on the iso and say write to disc... the dialog comes up I click the button for burn... it says "Insert a blank cd into the drive"
