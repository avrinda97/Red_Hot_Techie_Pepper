2007-02-14T07:07:00.000Z	Vilhelms		I am having a problem where World of Warcraft has bad FPS and after about a minute hangs, as well as my whole PC and can't seem to find a solution for it. Here is some output related to my video card, http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/5608/. Does anyone have any idea of what I could try?
2007-02-14T07:07:00.000Z	linxeh	Vilhelms	get a proper graphics card
2007-02-14T07:08:00.000Z	linxeh	Vilhelms	what card do you have ?
2007-02-14T07:08:00.000Z	Vilhelms	linxeh	ATI Xpress 200
2007-02-14T07:09:00.000Z	linxeh	Vilhelms	I'm running WoW on an AMD64 machine using an Nvidia 6600GT pci express card, but using Cedega rather than wine
2007-02-14T07:09:00.000Z	linxeh	Vilhelms	I havent tried Wine by itself yet
2007-02-14T07:09:00.000Z	Vilhelms	linxeh	Cedega is the one you pay for, right?
2007-02-14T07:09:00.000Z	linxeh	Vilhelms	yeah
2007-02-14T07:09:00.000Z	Vilhelms	linxeh	Is there a way I could try to see if I can get it working with like a trial version or something?
2007-02-14T07:10:00.000Z	linxeh	Vilhelms	some people say that crossover office has less problems
2007-02-14T07:10:00.000Z	linxeh	Vilhelms	you can get a 30 day trial of crossover - might be worth a go
2007-02-14T07:10:00.000Z	Vilhelms	linxeh	I think I will
2007-02-14T07:10:00.000Z	linxeh	Vilhelms	is your PC overclocked ?
2007-02-14T07:10:00.000Z	Vilhelms	linxeh	No, its a laptop
2007-02-14T07:11:00.000Z	linxeh	Vilhelms	ahh - I've yet to get the fglrx driver to work on my laptop :(
2007-02-14T07:12:00.000Z	linxeh	Vilhelms	I dont think you can get a trial of it
2007-02-28T06:56:00.000Z	linxeh	Vilhelms	maybe you need to get Cedega to use ALSA for audio IO or something
2007-02-28T06:57:00.000Z	Vilhelms	linxeh	It is using alsa
