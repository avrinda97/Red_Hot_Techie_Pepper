2005-08-21T12:57:00.000Z	yyc747		is there an easy way to open ports on the default ubuntu firewall after install?
2005-08-21T12:59:00.000Z	rob_p	yyc747	 There is no default firewall on Ubuntu.
2005-08-21T13:04:00.000Z	rob_p	yyc747	 No!
2005-08-21T13:05:00.000Z	yyc747	rob_p	sorry, I didn't see your last reply
2005-08-21T13:05:00.000Z	rob_p	yyc747	 No prob :-)
2005-08-21T13:07:00.000Z	rob_p	yyc747	 Probably your router or something.
2005-08-21T13:09:00.000Z	yyc747	rob_p	port forwarding is set up
2005-08-21T13:10:00.000Z	rob_p	yyc747	 Is your ISP blocking inbound to port 80?
2005-08-21T13:10:00.000Z	yyc747	rob_p	I'm running it on 8080, actually
2005-08-21T13:12:00.000Z	rob_p	yyc747	 I see.  Sounds like your port forwarding is not working properly.
2005-08-21T13:12:00.000Z	yyc747	rob_p	any idea why that would be?  it has worked properly in the past
2005-08-21T13:14:00.000Z	rob_p	yyc747	 Do you have a way to verify that external connections to your network on port 8080 are failing?
2005-08-21T13:18:00.000Z	yyc747	rob_p	no, I don't have any way of verifying I can't connect, other than what other people have already told me
2005-08-21T13:19:00.000Z	yyc747	rob_p	I just tested it with a free shell account, and it isn't working
2005-08-21T13:22:00.000Z	rob_p	yyc747	 Is the connection dropped and thus causing a long timeout, or it it closed with a tcp reset and you get disconnected right away?
2005-08-21T13:22:00.000Z	yyc747	rob_p	I can't tell... I just get "permission denied"
2005-08-21T13:22:00.000Z	rob_p	yyc747	 what is the IP address?
2005-08-21T13:22:00.000Z	yyc747	rob_p	probably the reset, because it happens almost instantaneously
