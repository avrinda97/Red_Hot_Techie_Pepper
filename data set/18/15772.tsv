2005-01-29T14:33:00.000Z	whaq_	daniels	the so called lights-out management?
2005-01-29T14:31:00.000Z	whaq_	daniels	why do you say that?
2005-01-29T14:32:00.000Z	daniels	whaq_	because they're very solid, reliable, and their remote management is astounding
2005-01-29T14:33:00.000Z	daniels	whaq_	when the server's off, you can feed it an iso over the network, and say 'here, turn yourself on and boot this', for example
2005-01-29T14:33:00.000Z	whaq_	daniels	cool. We're needing to get some servers. Where would be a good place to buy those?
2005-01-29T14:34:00.000Z	daniels	whaq_	ilo, yeah.  proliants aren't cheap, so basically anywhere you can get them that's reasonably cheap.
2005-01-29T14:36:00.000Z	whaq_	daniels	any pointers on where to get them? any specific vendors?
2005-01-29T14:38:00.000Z	daniels	whaq_	not really, sorry; i haven't bought the ones I've worked on (got them directly through HP), and even if I had, my supplier would be in .au
2005-01-29T14:42:00.000Z	whaq_	daniels	we're neighbors though. I'm in Jakarta.
2005-01-29T14:42:00.000Z	daniels	whaq_	oh, nice!
2005-01-29T14:43:00.000Z	daniels	whaq_	dapat berbahasa indo, tapi tidak dgn lancar
2005-01-29T14:43:00.000Z	whaq_	daniels	i've been to some european countries, the states, china and other asian countries, but never once to au or nz =) i've some cousins and acquaintances there though.
2005-01-29T14:43:00.000Z	whaq_	daniels	haha hebat!
2005-01-29T14:43:00.000Z	daniels	whaq_	well, nope, but yeah, if I was buying from anyone, they'd be Australian, which probably isn't too good for you
2005-01-29T14:43:00.000Z	daniels	whaq_	:)
2005-01-29T14:44:00.000Z	whaq_	daniels	actually, if there are any good sources from .au, the shipping charges and leadtime may be good. My other option would be local resellers (mostly expensive), or singapore.
2005-01-29T14:44:00.000Z	daniels	whaq_	true dat
2005-01-29T14:44:00.000Z	daniels	whaq_	yeah
