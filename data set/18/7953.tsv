2007-11-27T01:42:00.000Z	Kengur1		guys anyone got this thumbnails problem or it's just me here using torrent exclusively??
2007-11-27T01:43:00.000Z	mewt	Kengur1	i use torrents too, however i never encountered the problem as i don't use thumbnails
2007-11-27T01:44:00.000Z	Kengur1	mewt	so u suggest to get rid of the problem by bitting off one of my legs or something? =)
2007-11-27T01:44:00.000Z	mewt	Kengur1	id simply disable thumbnails for that folder temporarily
2007-11-27T01:45:00.000Z	mewt	Kengur1	unless thumbnails are essential to you
2007-11-27T01:46:00.000Z	Kengur1	mewt	and how do i disable tn just for one folder??
2007-11-27T01:46:00.000Z	mewt	Kengur1	view -> view as list
2007-11-27T01:47:00.000Z	Kengur1	mewt	this too uses thumbnails, just tiny ones =)
2007-11-27T01:47:00.000Z	mewt	Kengur1	mm hrmph..got me there :O
2007-11-27T01:48:00.000Z	mewt	Kengur1	try: edit>preferences
2007-11-27T01:48:00.000Z	mewt	Kengur1	last tab
2007-11-27T01:50:00.000Z	Kengur1	mewt	it doesn't even have the right settings, all my files are way above 5Mb default settings... still gets thumbed =)
2007-11-27T01:50:00.000Z	mewt	Kengur1	even if u set it to files larger than 1gb ?
2007-11-27T01:51:00.000Z	mewt	Kengur1	well you can set to show thumbnails: never
2007-11-27T01:52:00.000Z	Kengur1	mewt	it says 'smaller than' right next to it.. you imply it means 'more than' insteand? =)
2007-11-27T01:53:00.000Z	mewt	Kengur1	i set mine to never show thumbnails and are not being shown
2007-11-27T01:53:00.000Z	Kengur1	mewt	might be a wise choice after all =)
2007-11-27T01:54:00.000Z	mewt	Kengur1	it's really a work around more than a fix however i dont think thumbnails are that vital
