2010-01-15T20:06:00.000Z	magicvibe		hi can someone provide me with some help... ive recently installed some package updates via the update manager, but after rebooting my screen res dropped to 640x480, my monitor was recognized as a crt but it's an LCD also all my "windows" have no window border
2010-01-15T20:07:00.000Z	erUSUL	magicvibe	how did you installed the graphic drivers you where using
2010-01-15T20:10:00.000Z	erUSUL	magicvibe	try system>administration>hardware drivers.
2010-01-15T20:11:00.000Z	erUSUL	magicvibe	maybe you had compiz enabled; now the driver does not work and hence compiz can not work either
2010-01-15T20:12:00.000Z	erUSUL	magicvibe	it would be usefull to see the output of « grep EE /var/log/Xorg.0.log » and ~/.xsession-errors
2010-01-15T20:15:00.000Z	erUSUL	magicvibe	try « alt + f2 » run « metacity --replace »
2010-01-15T20:16:00.000Z	erUSUL	magicvibe	:) now you can investigate the issue
2010-01-15T20:16:00.000Z	erUSUL	magicvibe	it would be usefull to see the output of « grep EE /var/log/Xorg.0.log » and ~/.xsession-errors
2010-01-15T20:17:00.000Z	erUSUL	magicvibe	anything else?
2010-01-15T20:18:00.000Z	erUSUL	magicvibe	better post both files /var/log/Xorg.0.log and  ~/.xsession-errors
2010-01-15T20:20:00.000Z	erUSUL	magicvibe	yes; you can use pastebinit
2010-01-15T20:21:00.000Z	erUSUL	magicvibe	no post the whole files. « pastebinit /var/log/Xorg.0.log » « pastebinit ~/.xsession-errors »
2010-01-15T20:27:00.000Z	erUSUL	magicvibe	nothing wrong per se in the log ... except maybe No modes were requested; the default mode "nvidia-auto-select" <<<<< maybe that explains the low resolution/ bit depht
2010-01-15T20:30:00.000Z	erUSUL	magicvibe	i will try to use nvidia-settings to configure the card « gksudo nvidia-settings »
2010-01-15T20:31:00.000Z	erUSUL	magicvibe	save the new Xorg.conf (there is a button to do it)
2010-01-15T20:32:00.000Z	erUSUL	magicvibe	do → sudo mv /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.bak
2010-01-15T20:32:00.000Z	erUSUL	magicvibe	run again
2010-01-15T20:35:00.000Z	erUSUL	magicvibe	yes
