2009-03-18T22:32:00.000Z	ftab_		When I install VirtualBox it gives me the KDE look & feel on Gnome
2009-03-18T22:32:00.000Z	ftab_		and If i install Virtualbox-ose then its fine what could be the problem?
2009-03-18T22:32:00.000Z	LjL	ftab_	that's because it's a Qt app.
2009-03-18T22:32:00.000Z	ftab_	LjL	what about the virtualbox-ose?
2009-03-18T22:33:00.000Z	ftab_	LjL	are you there?
2009-03-18T22:33:00.000Z	LjL	ftab_	no problem really, it's probably just that virtualbox-ose, being an ubuntu package, is compiled to try to use a theme that better matches your GNOME desktop (while still being a Qt app), while on the other hand the VirtualBox you download elsewhere is just a statically linked binary.
2009-03-18T22:33:00.000Z	LjL	ftab_	yes, i'm here, but i haven't been able to beat the world record of typing speed yet
2009-03-18T22:34:00.000Z	ftab_	LjL	thank you for the response :) I got worried if some one would reply or not
2009-03-18T22:35:00.000Z	ftab_		any way, is there any package available for UBUNTU ? which should have a gnome look & feel?
2009-03-18T22:35:00.000Z	LjL	ftab_	i don't know, but what's wrong with virtualbox-ose to begin with?
2009-03-18T22:35:00.000Z	ftab_		USB support :(
2009-03-18T22:37:00.000Z	ftab_		no I  want to access my Pocket PC using ActiveSync from windows
2009-03-18T22:37:00.000Z	LjL	ftab_	you do know there are tools available to access your Pocket PC straight from Ubuntu?
2009-03-18T22:37:00.000Z	ftab_		I guess there is Kync
2009-03-18T22:37:00.000Z	ftab_		*Ksync
2009-03-18T22:38:00.000Z	ftab_		but that doesn't support all the features, I would like to connect through GPRS to my laptop
2009-03-18T22:39:00.000Z	ftab_	LjL	there is a QGTKStyle which provides the native look and feel for QT applications in Gnome but that is still in LAB :(
2009-03-18T22:40:00.000Z	LjL	ftab_	there are instructions here https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PortableDevices/WindowsMobile for using a Windows device as a wireless modem
