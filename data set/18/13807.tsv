2006-02-19T10:03:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	jordan	--safe-mode, with two hyphens at the beginning.
2006-02-19T10:19:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	jordan	Yeah, dialup was the interesting point for me just getting started too.
2006-02-19T10:25:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	jordan	"Floater is a free program for duplicate bridge play on the Internet.  It also supports non-duplicate bridge and 3-player hearts."  <-- Might be a start
2006-02-19T10:25:00.000Z	jordan	tonyyarusso	can you play it without internet?
2006-02-19T10:25:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	jordan	Don't know.  Just got that from apt-cache.
2006-02-19T10:26:00.000Z	jordan	tonyyarusso	kay, I'll try it
2006-02-19T10:49:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	jordan	What do you mean by on the same thing?  I have Gnome, KDE, IceWM, Enlightenment, Afterstep, Fluxbox, XFCE all on the same installation/partition/disk.
2006-02-19T10:50:00.000Z	jordan	tonyyarusso	yeah, I've had it before also, I just heard not to have GDE and the k package equivilant on the same box before, maybe I'm wrong
2006-02-19T10:50:00.000Z	jordan	tonyyarusso	I love xfce
2006-02-19T10:51:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	jordan	Don't know who told you that nonsense.
