2011-08-06T03:15:00.000Z	acidrain		can anyone help me?
2011-08-06T03:16:00.000Z	acidrain		how do i make ubuntu automatically connect to the router?
2011-08-06T03:16:00.000Z	acidrain		and keep trying to connect until it does
2011-08-06T03:16:00.000Z	klossor	acidrain	hit edit connections, goto your wireless connection and edit properties, inside mark the checkbox for "connect automatically"
2011-08-06T03:20:00.000Z	acidrain	klossor	i did. it still dont connect by itself
2011-08-06T03:21:00.000Z	klossor	acidrain	when you entered the key wep/wpa, did you hit "remember pass" check box?
2011-08-06T03:21:00.000Z	acidrain	klossor	well i have a bridge. so its a wired connection
2011-08-06T03:21:00.000Z	klossor		hmmm
2011-08-06T03:22:00.000Z	klossor	acidrain	not sure why a wired connect isnt connecting...
2011-08-06T03:23:00.000Z	acidrain	klossor	well its through a bridge. so technically its a wired wireless connection lol
2011-08-06T03:23:00.000Z	acidrain		but the point is, its not automatically trying to connect continuously
2011-08-06T03:23:00.000Z	klossor	acidrain	lol, sounds tricky
2011-08-06T03:23:00.000Z	acidrain		cause sometimes a problem may happen between the bridge and the router
2011-08-06T03:23:00.000Z	acidrain		i think its seriously the router. but it should still always try to connect
2011-08-06T03:24:00.000Z	acidrain		my thing is that when i finally get to my box, its not trying to connect
2011-08-06T03:24:00.000Z	acidrain		i wouldnt be as mad everytime if i just saw it attempting to fix something
2011-08-06T03:25:00.000Z	klossor	acidrain	nasty :/ I really would be only guessing at this point, not sure what way to go about that one...
2011-08-06T03:25:00.000Z	acidrain	klossor	and its hard to google for good results
