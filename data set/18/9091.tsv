2008-06-11T19:01:00.000Z	Lacrymology		I need help installing a network printer
2008-06-11T19:02:00.000Z	scunizi	Lacrymology	what kind
2008-06-11T19:02:00.000Z	Lacrymology	scunizi	it's an HP, I'll go look at the model if that's useful
2008-06-11T19:03:00.000Z	scunizi	Lacrymology	naw.. that's ok.. HP's are pretty compatible.. you need to read hp's page on linux for correct setup.. ipp or lpt .. but it'll  work
2008-06-11T19:04:00.000Z	scunizi	Lacrymology	is it actually connected to the network or you want to network it via usb?
2008-06-11T19:07:00.000Z	scunizi	Lacrymology	also you should be able to set a static ip address for it ..
2008-06-11T19:14:00.000Z	Lacrymology	scunizi	no, you don't get the issue
2008-06-11T19:19:00.000Z	scunizi	Lacrymology	that still doesn't tell me if the printer is hooked via ethernet or into a machine via usb or some other way.
2008-06-11T19:20:00.000Z	Lacrymology	scunizi	ethernet
2008-06-11T19:22:00.000Z	scunizi	Lacrymology	so you'll need to find the ip of the printer.. not sure about hp but samsung has a self discovery tool for their ethernet printers.. hp might have something like that too. otherwise you'll have to manually configure it. samba isn't neccessary is this case..
2008-06-11T19:23:00.000Z	Lacrymology	scunizi	once again, I ask.. how do I do this? I can't find any "install printers" or similar anywhere
2008-06-11T19:24:00.000Z	scunizi	Lacrymology	open firefox and go to localhost:631
2008-06-11T19:27:00.000Z	Lacrymology	scunizi	great. Now I need the IP
2008-06-11T19:28:00.000Z	scunizi	Lacrymology	check out another machine if  you can that can print to that printer.
2008-06-11T19:31:00.000Z	Lacrymology	scunizi	ok, mistake, or maybe not, I don't know. The printer's connected to it's host machine via USB, which is connected to mine via an ethernet network..
2008-06-11T19:32:00.000Z	scunizi	Lacrymology	ok.. now you're back to samba.. but if it's shared on that machine you might be able to locate it via system/Admin/Printing and searching for it after clicking "add printer"
2008-06-11T19:37:00.000Z	Lacrymology	scunizi	ok, the thing was I don't have gnome, I run xfce, and I couldn't find it. man -k printers was the solution. I'll go bang my head against the wall for not calling on man before
2008-06-11T19:38:00.000Z	scunizi	Lacrymology	glad you got it.. :)
