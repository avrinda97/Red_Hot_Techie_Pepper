2008-06-19T09:27:00.000Z	Izinucs	bullgard4	I was just reading about that tonight.
2008-06-19T09:27:00.000Z	bullgard4	Izinucs	I am still here. You spelled my nick wrongly so I did not attend first.
2008-06-19T09:28:00.000Z	Izinucs	bullgard4	yea.. I realized that after the 2nd try.. Hang on let me look this up
2008-06-19T09:28:00.000Z	bullgard4	Izinucs	yes, I will.
2008-06-19T09:30:00.000Z	Izinucs	bullgard4	ok.. first find the inode number of the file like.. ls -il /etc/hosts.. once you get the number then use the debugfs command "stat" to display the contents of the inode.. you'd type "stat <inode_number>"
2008-06-19T09:32:00.000Z	Izinucs	bullgard4	before issuing the stat command you have to "debugfs" first then "stat <number>".. when done "quit" to get out of debugfs
2008-06-19T09:33:00.000Z	Izinucs	bullgard4	did it work for you?
2008-06-19T09:33:00.000Z	bullgard4	Izinucs	I am still trying.
