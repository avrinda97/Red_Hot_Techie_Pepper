2009-03-21T23:20:00.000Z	mrwes	gordonjcp	I agress...my stick has a .trash with files and info
2009-04-24T17:55:00.000Z	gordonjcp	mrwes	you could, if you're finished with it - but it's better to keep it around in case you want to update
2009-04-24T17:56:00.000Z	mrwes	gordonjcp	kinda new to svn packages
2009-04-24T17:56:00.000Z	gordonjcp	mrwes	do you know what Subversion is?
2009-04-24T17:56:00.000Z	mrwes	gordonjcp	barely -- just used it to install rtorrent on my server -- successfully I might add
2009-04-24T17:57:00.000Z	gordonjcp	mrwes	okay, basically it's a source control system
2009-04-24T17:57:00.000Z	gordonjcp	mrwes	so if you check out svn trunk, that's the latest, just-being-written version of the code
2009-04-24T17:57:00.000Z	mrwes	gordonjcp	hbekel ahh..ok, so that way I can have the latest source on a package to compile and install?
2009-04-24T17:58:00.000Z	gordonjcp	mrwes	now I come along, and push an update to the server becuase I've fixed some heinous bug, and you do "svn update" as hbekel says, rebuild, reinstall
2009-04-24T17:58:00.000Z	gordonjcp	mrwes	clever stuff, eh
2009-04-24T17:58:00.000Z	mrwes	gordonjcp	hbekel very damn kewl -- so after svn update, it would be .configure make and make install again?
2009-04-24T17:59:00.000Z	gordonjcp	mrwes	the downside is that tracking the latest and greatest, I might have introduced another bug, so you update, rebuild, reinstall and my bug makes your freezer defrost
2009-04-24T17:59:00.000Z	mrwes	gordonjcp	heh..ok ok
2009-04-24T18:00:00.000Z	mrwes	gordonjcp	so best to investigate before do a svn update
2009-04-24T18:00:00.000Z	gordonjcp	mrwes	well that's the other nice thing - you can check out older versions too
2009-04-24T18:04:00.000Z	mrwes	gordonjcp	hbekel -- thanks for the help
2009-04-24T18:04:00.000Z	gordonjcp	mrwes	no
2009-04-24T18:04:00.000Z	gordonjcp	mrwes	np, even
