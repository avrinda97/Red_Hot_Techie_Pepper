2005-09-10T08:09:00.000Z	PuGz	CarLBanks	crossover office and transgaming provide non open source software alternatives to wine... they work a LOT better
2005-09-10T08:10:00.000Z	PuGz	CarLBanks	yes... if you have some programs which you MUST run... it is a good idea to keep windows on your computer as a dual boot
2005-09-10T08:10:00.000Z	PuGz	CarLBanks	but you say it like its linux's fault: microsoft wont tell the world how windows works... so we cant make it work in linux... we try!
