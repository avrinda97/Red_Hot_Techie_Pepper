2005-12-12T15:42:00.000Z	Fujitsu	topyli	what is with his home?
2005-12-12T15:43:00.000Z	topyli	Fujitsu	he changed the permissions of /home to 777, and has found strange files in there
2005-12-12T15:43:00.000Z	Fujitsu	topyli	odd.
2005-12-12T15:43:00.000Z	Fujitsu	topyli	what services were running?
2005-12-12T15:44:00.000Z	topyli	Fujitsu	looks like someone's been there. a strange processs running
2005-12-12T15:44:00.000Z	topyli	Fujitsu	that's why i recommended a reinstall
2005-12-12T15:45:00.000Z	Fujitsu	topyli	probably a good idea to reinstall. Must have been ssh or something.
2005-12-12T15:45:00.000Z	Fujitsu	topyli	have we checked for odd services that could be used to get in? By using netstat for example?
2005-12-12T15:46:00.000Z	topyli	Fujitsu	no
2005-12-12T15:48:00.000Z	Fujitsu	topyli	once is correct. Most things only happen once, that rm -rf .* as root, to remove some . files from /root. That was a bad day, although a good few years ago!
2005-12-12T15:49:00.000Z	topyli	Fujitsu	i also typed rm -rf * into the wrong terminal once. deleted my home
2005-12-12T15:49:00.000Z	Fujitsu	topyli	I deleted the entire filesystem...
2005-12-12T15:49:00.000Z	topyli	Fujitsu	cleanup day! =)
2005-12-12T16:04:00.000Z	Fujitsu	topyli	I never liked SWAT at all either.
2005-12-12T16:08:00.000Z	Fujitsu	topyli	id will do it!
2005-12-12T16:09:00.000Z	topyli	Fujitsu	live and learn! :)
2005-12-12T16:13:00.000Z	topyli	Fujitsu	X clients may not necessarily depend on a working X. there's remote X too :)
2005-12-12T16:27:00.000Z	topyli	Fujitsu	MOTU is plural
