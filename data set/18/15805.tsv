2005-01-23T07:42:00.000Z	FuNgEx		my skype installation failled
2005-01-23T07:43:00.000Z	madsen	FuNgEx	How did you try to install it?
2005-01-23T07:44:00.000Z	madsen	FuNgEx	Isn't there an RPM for it?
2005-01-23T07:44:00.000Z	madsen	FuNgEx	Then just convert that to a .deb pkg with 'alien' and install it. :)
2005-01-23T07:44:00.000Z	madsen	FuNgEx	Worked great on Debian
2005-01-23T07:45:00.000Z	FuNgEx	madsen	i'm new to linux...
2005-01-23T07:45:00.000Z	madsen	FuNgEx	Doesn't matter, try it out. :) It can't hurt. You can always uninstall it again.
2005-01-23T07:46:00.000Z	FuNgEx	madsen	there are various rpm's
2005-01-23T07:47:00.000Z	madsen	FuNgEx	Just install 'alien' (it should be in the packages list) and then get the RPM and do 'alien skype-xxxxx.rpm' and then 'dpkg -i skype_xxxxx.deb' (where the x's are replaced by the rest of the file name.
2005-01-23T07:47:00.000Z	madsen	FuNgEx	Go after a RedHat if possible.
2005-01-23T07:47:00.000Z	madsen	FuNgEx	-^ :)

2005-01-23T07:52:00.000Z	FuNgEx	madsen	in case i need to unistall it should be dpkg -?
2005-01-23T07:52:00.000Z	madsen	FuNgEx	dpkg --purge   if I recall correct.
2005-01-23T07:54:00.000Z	madsen	FuNgEx	Not on a local .deb file
