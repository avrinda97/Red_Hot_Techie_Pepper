2007-08-10T11:13:00.000Z	Am2U		I am running on Ubuntu fiesty and tried to get 5.1 surround sound to work . I followed this guide (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HdaIntelSoundHowto) and well now all the right channel speakers are working . i.e - right front , rear and center
2007-08-10T11:13:00.000Z	Am2U		left rear and surround are not working
2007-08-10T11:13:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	Am2U	are you certain that there plugged in correctly

2007-08-10T11:27:00.000Z	Am2U	Paddy_EIRE	i did some tweaking like you said and i found out something
