2008-04-19T21:09:00.000Z	WildChil17		hello there. How can I made a user with limited accesss. So it can only modify ONE directory and in it subdirectorys ?
2008-04-19T21:10:00.000Z	WildChil17		anyone ?
2008-04-19T21:11:00.000Z	linxeh	WildChil17	thats the definition of all users - they can only modify the directories / files they own or are in the group for
2008-04-19T21:11:00.000Z	linxeh	WildChil17	unless there are "world writable" users
2008-04-19T21:12:00.000Z	linxeh	WildChil17	what exactly do you want to do?
2008-04-19T21:13:00.000Z	WildChil17	linxeh	I want to make a user that can remotely access to ubuntu machine and can upload via winscp some files in this directory...
2008-04-19T21:13:00.000Z	WildChil17	linxeh	I don't wannt this user to install or uninstall anything just to copy files on my ubuntu machine or delete BUT ONLY FOR one directory..
2008-04-19T21:14:00.000Z	linxeh	WildChil17	just create a new normal user - they wont be able to do anything dangerous to the system, except in their home directory
2008-04-19T21:14:00.000Z	WildChil17	linxeh	sudo user ?
2008-04-19T21:14:00.000Z	linxeh	WildChil17	add a user with the utilities on the menus
2008-04-19T21:14:00.000Z	WildChil17	linxeh	and how big would be theri home directory '
2008-04-19T21:15:00.000Z	WildChil17	linxeh	he doesn't need anything GUI..
2008-04-19T21:15:00.000Z	linxeh	WildChil17	as big as the free space on the device you choose for their home directory location (it doesnt have to be in /home). unless you install quota tools
2008-04-19T21:15:00.000Z	linxeh	WildChil17	but your system has a gui on it ?
2008-04-19T21:15:00.000Z	WildChil17	linxeh	yep
2008-04-19T21:15:00.000Z	WildChil17	linxeh	sometimes I also do some GUI things via VNC..
2008-04-19T21:15:00.000Z	linxeh	WildChil17	yeah, so create the user in the gui tools - or you can use the useradd / adduser commands
2008-04-19T21:16:00.000Z	WildChil17	linxeh	oh ok..
