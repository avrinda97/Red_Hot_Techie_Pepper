2010-05-16T09:01:00.000Z	ubuntu__		how come my ubuntu install is slower than the live cd
2010-05-16T09:01:00.000Z	ubuntu__		?
2010-05-16T09:02:00.000Z	mgmuscari	ubuntu__	my guess, the live cd caches things in a ram disk as you use them, making them much faster to access once they're loaded in
2010-05-16T09:03:00.000Z	ubuntu__	mgmuscari	is there any way to do this is the original install to make it faster
2010-05-16T09:05:00.000Z	mgmuscari	ubuntu__	well i guess it depends on your setup... might want to take a loot at how you've partitioned your drive. did you make a swap partition?
2010-05-16T09:07:00.000Z	ubuntu__	mgmuscari	here is my setup, amd athlon xII 5200, gigabyte mobo, using mobo's graphics (no graphics card) and one sata hd and one ata hd
2010-05-16T09:07:00.000Z	ubuntu__	mgmuscari	oh and i forgot 4 gb of ram
2010-05-16T09:07:00.000Z	mgmuscari	ubuntu__	so what are your performance problems?
2010-05-16T09:08:00.000Z	ubuntu__	mgmuscari	during the setup it made a 2gb swap partition idk if that is enough or not
2010-05-16T09:08:00.000Z	mgmuscari	ubuntu__	that's fine
2010-05-16T09:10:00.000Z	mgmuscari	ubuntu__	what do you mean by "slow" anyway?
2010-05-16T09:10:00.000Z	ubuntu__	mgmuscari	basically everything is slower to start, and file trasfer is slower
2010-05-16T09:10:00.000Z	mgmuscari	ubuntu__	sounds like a disk i/o bottleneck. if you have it installed on an old IDE hard disk, then maybe your disk is feeling its age
2010-05-16T09:10:00.000Z	ubuntu__	mgmuscari	programs are slower to boot up, (im not talking about internet speed when i say slow)
2010-05-16T09:11:00.000Z	ubuntu__	mgmuscari	ok thanks i think the age is the problem because its a pretty old ide drive
2010-05-16T09:11:00.000Z	mgmuscari	ubuntu__	bad sectors and such can lead to disks being really slow
2010-05-16T09:12:00.000Z	ubuntu__	mgmuscari	and moetunes thanks for your help
2010-05-16T09:12:00.000Z	mgmuscari	ubuntu__	no problem
