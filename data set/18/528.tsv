2012-06-14T10:36:00.000Z	Volis		Hi
2012-06-14T10:37:00.000Z	Volis		I am trying to upgrade ubuntu with the ISO image I have of latest ubuntu amd64.
2012-06-14T10:37:00.000Z	Volis		I mounted it.
2012-06-14T10:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Volis	 alternative isoi or desktop?
2012-06-14T10:37:00.000Z	Volis		The steps on the internet said to execute, gksu "sh /media/cdrom/cdromupgrade" but it doesn't work.
2012-06-14T10:38:00.000Z	Volis	Dr_Willis	Desktop
2012-06-14T10:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Volis	 i think  that may only work with the alternative iso
2012-06-14T10:38:00.000Z	Volis	Dr_Willis	What is the way to upgrade from the desktop ISO I have then?
2012-06-14T10:39:00.000Z	Volis		It doesn't even autorun.
2012-06-14T10:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Volis	 not sure its  possible.
2012-06-14T10:39:00.000Z	Volis	Dr_Willis	Can I do a fresh install?
2012-06-14T10:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Volis	 you can always reforamt/reonstall
2012-06-14T10:40:00.000Z	Volis	Dr_Willis	See there seems to be a problem with my computer. I made a bootable USB from unetbootin and it cannot boot.
2012-06-14T10:40:00.000Z	Volis		I already have given USB first priority from boot loader options under BIOS.
2012-06-14T10:42:00.000Z	Volis	Dr_Willis	On windows I could have made it boot by the help of wubi making a boot sector but I don't know how to proceed now on ubuntu.
2012-06-14T10:42:00.000Z	Volis		I have ubuntu 10.04
2012-06-14T10:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Volis	 i use the tools from the pendrivelinux site.  - i never use wubi
2012-06-14T10:43:00.000Z	Volis	Dr_Willis	I used that too.
