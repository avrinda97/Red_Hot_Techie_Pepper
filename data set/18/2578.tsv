2010-04-15T02:27:00.000Z	crucialhoax	digevol	`ifconfig -a` what does that supply as of now?
2010-04-15T02:28:00.000Z	digevol	crucialhoax	i see an eth0 and lo
2010-04-15T02:31:00.000Z	crucialhoax	digevol	run `lshw -C Network` see if the wired interface has a driver or module
2010-04-15T02:33:00.000Z	digevol	crucialhoax	that cmd does spit out information about the controller, not sure what specifically i am looking for though
2010-04-15T02:34:00.000Z	crucialhoax	digevol	Towards the bottom, look for `driver=` or `module=`
2010-04-15T02:35:00.000Z	digevol	crucialhoax	oh yes, driver=e100 driverversion=3.5.24-k2-NAPI
2010-04-15T02:35:00.000Z	crucialhoax	digevol	Ok..are you using 9.10?
2010-04-15T02:35:00.000Z	digevol	crucialhoax	yes i am
2010-04-15T02:37:00.000Z	crucialhoax	digevol	Maybe this will help? http://www.ubuntugeek.com/fix-for-intel-cards-with-broken-eeprom-e100-driver.html
2010-04-15T02:37:00.000Z	digevol	crucialhoax	does that mean everything looks like it should be working from a technical standpoint?
2010-04-15T02:38:00.000Z	digevol	crucialhoax	 if so maybe the sys admins here have some type of firewall/network protection that i am unaware of and a fresh OS needs to somehow be configured by them first?
2010-04-15T02:39:00.000Z	crucialhoax	digevol	Are you asking me if the hardware itself is broken? No I do not think so. It is a configuration issue. I am not sure if that will solve it. Just a suggestion.
2010-04-15T02:39:00.000Z	digevol	crucialhoax	thanks, ill look at the link
2010-04-15T02:39:00.000Z	crucialhoax	digevol	That would not prevent the interface from coming up.
2010-04-15T02:40:00.000Z	crucialhoax	digevol	I may have found one more thing
2010-04-15T02:41:00.000Z	digevol	crucialhoax	what is that?
2010-04-15T02:42:00.000Z	crucialhoax	digevol	Maybe not, the thread I was reading from had a bad router port.. =/
2010-04-15T02:45:00.000Z	crucialhoax	digevol	I would see if the first suggestion works..
