2009-03-24T03:37:00.000Z	webbi		hello
2009-03-24T03:38:00.000Z	webbi		is there some place where ubuntu block some ports?
2009-03-24T03:38:00.000Z	Slart	webbi	nope.. not by default
2009-03-24T03:39:00.000Z	Slart	webbi	user applications can't bind to ports lower than 1024 I think... but the firewall doesn't do anything by default
2009-03-24T03:39:00.000Z	webbi	Slart	im using port 3118
2009-03-24T03:39:00.000Z	Slart	webbi	what makes you think ubuntu is blocking it?
2009-03-24T03:39:00.000Z	webbi	Slart	well... it works in other pc, but not in this one... connection refused
2009-03-24T03:40:00.000Z	webbi	Slart	also, it works if i use localhost... but when i go to other pc in the same network, it says connection refused
2009-03-24T03:40:00.000Z	Slart	webbi	what kind of software do you have listening on your end?
2009-03-24T03:40:00.000Z	webbi	Slart	i did a pretty easy app
2009-03-24T03:41:00.000Z	Slart	webbi	are you sure it's setup to listen on the external interface? most stuff doesn't do that
2009-03-24T03:41:00.000Z	Slart	webbi	or rather.. most stuff doesn't do that by default
2009-03-24T03:41:00.000Z	webbi	Slart	ok... i will check this a bit more...
2009-03-24T03:41:00.000Z	Slart	webbi	hope you find out why it's not working..
2009-03-24T03:42:00.000Z	webbi	Slart	i will keep you updated
2009-03-24T03:49:00.000Z	webbi	Slart	problem in my app :) i was using the lo device
2009-03-24T03:49:00.000Z	Slart	webbi	ah..good to see you found the problem =)
