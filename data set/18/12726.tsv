2006-03-16T10:49:00.000Z	moew		Hello. I have a problem with Eclipse on Ubuntu. It runs excruciatingly slow, I can't really edit any files, b/c when I start typing I get huge pauses between response times. I'm convinced that it has something to do with Java. My computer is fast enough it's like a Pentium 1.8 w/1 GB of RAM. So it's all good there. I tried to update my Java to 1.5 via instructions on the net (http://jroller.com/page/triplem74?entry=insta

2006-03-16T10:51:00.000Z	moew	Managu	Is this java debs that nalioth is talking about?
2006-03-16T10:51:00.000Z	Managu	moew	I haven't looked at nalioth's suggestion.  Lemme poke ubotu
2006-03-16T11:55:00.000Z	Managu	moew	another ATI card? =(
2006-03-16T11:56:00.000Z	moew	Managu	It works fine w/Windows XP btw.
2006-03-16T11:57:00.000Z	Managu	moew	no doubt.  Friend trying to install ubuntu_386 or ubuntu_x86_64 (or whatever the abbrev.s are)?
2006-03-16T12:00:00.000Z	moew	Managu	ubuntu_5.10_amd64.iso
2006-03-16T12:01:00.000Z	Managu	moew	Gotcha.  No real experience with that distribution, but I know I shied away from it on my amd64 box.  At least when I was installing, the 64 bit port had a status of "well, it sorta works"
2006-03-16T12:02:00.000Z	moew	Managu	So what works for amd?
2006-03-16T12:03:00.000Z	Managu	moew	well, the normal 32bit distribution runs like a charm
2006-03-16T12:05:00.000Z	moew	Managu	What should he do to make the 64 bit work?
2006-03-16T12:05:00.000Z	Managu	moew	no clue.  first things I'd try are (a) check the logs for any funny business, and (b) see if you can get a foolsafe session running
2006-03-16T12:06:00.000Z	moew	Managu	Alright Managu, thanks but I think that he just gave up :)
2006-03-16T12:06:00.000Z	Managu	moew	errm, not foolsafe.  Failsafe.  I think it's my bedtime
2006-03-16T12:06:00.000Z	moew	Managu	He's not very persistent.
2006-03-16T12:07:00.000Z	Managu	moew	sorry.  Maybe try Knoppix, heh
2006-03-16T12:07:00.000Z	Managu	moew	or ubuntu live cd
