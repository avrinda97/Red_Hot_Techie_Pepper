2011-02-26T00:16:00.000Z	ilessthan3ubuntu		if uname says i686 im still 32bit right/
2011-02-26T00:16:00.000Z	ilessthan3ubuntu		needs to be x64_86 for 64?
2011-02-26T00:16:00.000Z	maco	ilessthan3ubuntu	yes
2011-02-26T00:16:00.000Z	ilessthan3ubuntu	maco	ty
2011-03-04T00:12:00.000Z	maco	ilessthan3ubuntu	or you want to hibernate....
2011-03-04T00:13:00.000Z	ilessthan3ubuntu	maco	mine suspends just fine
2011-03-04T00:17:00.000Z	maco	ilessthan3ubuntu	i said hibernate, not suspend
2011-03-04T00:18:00.000Z	maco	ilessthan3ubuntu	hibernate = suspend to disk, not ram. the contents of ram are written to the swap partition
2011-03-04T00:18:00.000Z	ilessthan3ubuntu	maco	and i said suspend is fine i dont need hiber
2011-03-04T00:19:00.000Z	maco	ilessthan3ubuntu	i thought you were trying to say dont bother with ram and then since i said itd break hiber if you did that that you were trying to disagree with /that/
2011-03-04T00:19:00.000Z	ilessthan3ubuntu	maco	you mean dont bother with swap?
2011-03-04T00:19:00.000Z	maco	ilessthan3ubuntu	erm yeah
2011-03-04T00:19:00.000Z	ilessthan3ubuntu	maco	yeah i was saying that, he prolly needs it sinec he is new to this stuff
2011-03-04T00:23:00.000Z	maco	ilessthan3ubuntu	i dont know what "being new" and "needing the system to be able to stay in that state for a week instead of just a day" have to do with each other. or "new" and "needing it to be fully powered down to get on an airplane" have to do with each other either (no, suspend is actually not a valid response to "please turn off..." on the plane)
2011-03-04T00:24:00.000Z	ilessthan3ubuntu	maco	i never listen when they say turn off electronics
2011-03-04T00:26:00.000Z	ilessthan3ubuntu	maco	and i travel ALOT
2011-03-04T00:27:00.000Z	maco	ilessthan3ubuntu	well good for you for breaking the rules. would you like a cookie?
2011-03-04T00:27:00.000Z	ilessthan3ubuntu	maco	would you like a gold star for listening to authorit?
