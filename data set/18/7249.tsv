2012-05-14T08:23:00.000Z	Naemdar		Hello all, I have a design question for a a4 powered media computer
2012-05-14T08:24:00.000Z	Naemdar		Would I need a video capture card to intercept the signal from the cable box?
2012-05-14T08:24:00.000Z	Naemdar		going to run linux on it
2012-05-14T08:26:00.000Z	Naemdar		the mobo has hdmi out and I found a video capture card with dual hdmi
2012-05-14T08:27:00.000Z	Naemdar		Am I right in thinking I could rock ubuntu or mint and turn that rig into a capture/bd recorder then?
2012-05-14T08:28:00.000Z	Naemdar		as well as a bd player
2012-05-14T08:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Naemdar	what is 'bd'?
2012-05-14T08:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Naemdar	don't see why not
2012-05-14T08:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Naemdar	get an nvidia video card to :)
2012-05-14T08:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Naemdar	built in GPUs don't really cut it
2012-05-14T08:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Naemdar	you'll only need about 20Gb for linux (including swap)
2012-05-14T08:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Naemdar	trimslice will decode HD video...
2012-05-14T08:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Naemdar	i'd just buy a trimslice and a 1Tb USB HDD :)
2012-06-07T14:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Naemdar	how do you mean 'unpack'?
2012-06-07T14:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Naemdar	depends on PC spec and the drive the OS is installed to
2012-06-07T15:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Naemdar	my GF thinks its fine, although its setup well :)
2012-06-07T15:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Naemdar	could put it in /opt then symlink the binary to /usr/bin
2012-06-07T15:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Naemdar	I ran that once, took forever to load
