2010-03-17T08:30:00.000Z	Lovecraft_X	pfifo	Are you saying there is better?
2010-03-17T08:31:00.000Z	pfifo	Lovecraft_X	yeah
2010-03-17T08:31:00.000Z	Lovecraft_X	pfifo	alright, you'll have to inform me - give me something that can run Crysis at full spec :D
2010-03-17T08:32:00.000Z	pfifo	Lovecraft_X	Im sure that will run crysis at full spec, thats not hard todo. Best Nvidia atm is 295GTX i believe.
2010-03-17T08:34:00.000Z	Lovecraft_X	pfifo	wow! no kidding! now *that's a video card!
2010-03-17T08:34:00.000Z	Lovecraft_X	pfifo	and super expensive, too!
2010-03-17T08:35:00.000Z	pfifo	Lovecraft_X	GTS is the next step down, resonable price and can be SLi'd together for added performance.
2010-03-17T08:36:00.000Z	Lovecraft_X	pfifo	wouldn't the 9800gx2 run compiz at full speed and smoothly, thuough?
2010-03-17T08:38:00.000Z	pfifo	Lovecraft_X	yes, 9800 series is good enough, comparing apples to oranges, i would put the 9800 series as equal to PS2 graphics and the GT series at PS3 level
2010-03-17T08:40:00.000Z	Lovecraft_X	pfifo	the gts250 is what you're talking about right? i mean that looks pretty good and isn't ridiculously expensive
2010-03-17T08:41:00.000Z	pfifo	Lovecraft_X	i paid $160USD on christmas and I have yet to find anything that it cant run
2010-03-17T08:43:00.000Z	Lovecraft_X	pfifo	then its a great choice - ill go with it
2010-03-17T08:43:00.000Z	pfifo	Lovecraft_X	you shouldn't be disappoint
2010-03-17T08:45:00.000Z	pfifo	Lovecraft_X	and in a year when there 50 bucks you can get a second and bridge them together
2010-03-17T08:46:00.000Z	Lovecraft_X	pfifo	thats a great idea too
2010-03-17T08:46:00.000Z	pfifo	Lovecraft_X	thats my personal plan
2010-03-17T08:50:00.000Z	Lovecraft_X	pfifo	yeah but would the 512mb gts250 be a good choice and still run the newer games
2010-03-17T08:52:00.000Z	pfifo	Lovecraft_X	yes it will run all newer games, I recommend getting 1GB or better. Some of the newer games can used more than 512 for textures.
