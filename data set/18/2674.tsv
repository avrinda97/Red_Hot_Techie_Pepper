2010-03-22T00:18:00.000Z	Losha`	Purpley	is this a server you're running?
2010-03-22T00:18:00.000Z	Purpley	Losha`	No I disabled ssh awhile ago
2010-03-22T00:20:00.000Z	Losha`	Purpley	my point is that unless you are providing service to the internet, your machine should not even be accessible from the 'outside'. Doing so is just courting breakins. Consider configuring a firewall of some kind, or even better, put a NAT router between your desktop and the internet...
2010-03-22T00:20:00.000Z	Purpley	Losha`	I have a NAT router
2010-03-22T00:24:00.000Z	Losha`	Purpley	they are the same code, with different packages installed. In principle, you can convert one to the other by adding/removing packages. In practice, doing so is actually a huge hassle, hence: server vs desktop distros...
2010-03-22T00:25:00.000Z	Purpley	Losha`	Can I just use ubuntu home as a personal server with like 3-6 people accessing it at one time or should I go with the server edition
2010-03-22T00:26:00.000Z	Losha`	Purpley	with such a small load, you would be fine either way. If you also want to use it as a desktop, I think it will be easier to use the desktop edition and add services, rather than take the server edition and add a desktop...
2010-03-22T00:28:00.000Z	Losha`	Purpley	and though you didn't ask, you need to work on your security arrangements...
2010-03-22T00:28:00.000Z	Purpley	Losha`	What do you mean
2010-03-22T00:30:00.000Z	Losha`	Purpley	well you told me you were sitting in a DMZ and someone off the internet wandered in and tried to share your desktop. If you're providing services over the internet, you can expect more strenuous attempts to break into your system over time...
2010-03-22T00:31:00.000Z	Purpley	Losha`	Everything thats important is encrypted if they do get in and the only reason I was in DMZ was to test something
2010-03-22T00:32:00.000Z	Losha`	Purpley	that explains it. It did seem odd that someone who knew about NAT routers and DMZ would allow such an attack. But there *are* griefers out there...
