2005-05-26T15:49:00.000Z	kestas	liable	yup
2005-05-26T15:49:00.000Z	liable	kestas	damn I thought you might know what to put just for headers
2005-05-26T15:50:00.000Z	kestas	liable	imho you might as well just install the source, it comes in handy from time to time, and only takes ~60mb
2005-05-26T15:50:00.000Z	liable	kestas	talking to the converted :)
2005-05-26T15:50:00.000Z	kestas	liable	k :)
2005-05-26T15:52:00.000Z	liable	kestas	no source, just headers
2005-05-26T15:53:00.000Z	kestas	liable	I think you need source
2005-05-26T15:53:00.000Z	kestas	liable	but if you dont then fine

2005-05-26T15:54:00.000Z	kestas	liable	yeah I understand that much, but he needs to install source right?
2005-05-26T15:55:00.000Z	liable	kestas	i'm not convinced he does, just needs that line to point to his headers
2005-06-05T08:24:00.000Z	liable	kestas	maybe try changer user to username?
