2011-10-07T12:02:00.000Z	ubuntu__		I am confused which key goes where when using ssh?
2011-10-07T12:02:00.000Z	Gruber	ubuntu__	public key on the server, private key on the client
2011-10-07T12:03:00.000Z	ubuntu__	Gruber	ok the client being the machine that I am connecting from?
2011-10-07T12:04:00.000Z	Gruber	ubuntu__	correct
2011-10-07T12:05:00.000Z	Gruber	ubuntu__	have you put the public key in the authorized_keys file on the server, in the .ssh directory of the user ?
2011-10-07T12:06:00.000Z	ubuntu__	Gruber	yes (I am able to connect on my windows machine via putty)
2011-10-07T12:07:00.000Z	Gruber	ubuntu__	what command (exactly) are you using to ssh
2011-10-07T12:07:00.000Z	ubuntu__	Gruber	just ssh 192.168.2.109
2011-10-07T12:07:00.000Z	Gruber	ubuntu__	is your username on the remote machine "ubuntu"
2011-10-07T12:08:00.000Z	Gruber	ubuntu__	to
2011-10-07T12:08:00.000Z	Gruber	ubuntu__	that's the issue then
2011-10-07T12:08:00.000Z	Gruber	ubuntu__	unless you use a username, it will use your current username
2011-10-07T12:08:00.000Z	Gruber	ubuntu__	ssh on linux is different than putty
2011-10-07T12:09:00.000Z	ubuntu__	Gruber	ok :) thanks
2011-10-07T12:09:00.000Z	Gruber	ubuntu__	do either "ssh username@hostname" or "ssh -l username hostname"
2011-10-07T12:09:00.000Z	ubuntu__	Gruber	right got it :) it is working now
2011-10-07T12:10:00.000Z	ubuntu__	Gruber	hmm interesting it seems that my connection via putty on windows 7 craps out quick yet I am now connected via ubuntu live cd on the same machine as the windows machine and its not kicking me out very odd (at least I know its not a hardware issue with my nic card :)
2011-10-07T12:13:00.000Z	ubuntu__	Gruber	how do I connect if the private key is name garysmachine and not id_rsa?
