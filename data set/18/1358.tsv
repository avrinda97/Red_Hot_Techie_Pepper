2011-04-09T19:20:00.000Z	chris__		im trying to fix it,
2011-04-09T19:20:00.000Z	chris__		marien ok how do I fix a broken gnome?
2011-04-09T19:21:00.000Z	chris__		marien 10.04 ubuntu.  Was working great.  I ran the auto update as usual.  Then turned off the computer.  Later in the day I turned it on and booted into gnome.  Now gnome boots up but if I click on anything it just hangs forever.  KDE is working fine now.
2011-04-09T19:23:00.000Z	chris__		marien the panel and the desktop icons.  When I click on an icon, all the icons dissapear, the HD light goes on and just stays on, nothing happens.  If I click on the panel it will show the options for that menu system, they vanish and additional clicks on the panel do nothing
2011-04-09T19:23:00.000Z	chris__		marien nothing at all works.
2011-04-09T19:23:00.000Z	chris__		marien ah...

2011-04-09T19:24:00.000Z	chris__		attyn  works in kde desktop
2011-04-09T19:25:00.000Z	brightspark	chris__	can you launch a terminal using ctrl-alt-t?
2012-02-18T12:20:00.000Z	brightspark	chris__	^^
2012-02-18T12:24:00.000Z	brightspark	chris__	nmap -sP 1.1.1.2-10 | grep Host | awk '{print $2}'
2012-02-18T12:25:00.000Z	brightspark	chris__	the second field.  awk treats spaces as separators by default.
2012-02-18T12:27:00.000Z	brightspark	chris__	I've never touched php.  If you're embedding it in a string, most languages require you to escape it
2012-02-18T12:29:00.000Z	brightspark	chris__	In many situations, you can just put a backslash in front of the $ and it will work
2012-02-18T12:30:00.000Z	brightspark	chris__	you will also need to precede the space after "print" with a backslash as you removed my quotes
2012-02-18T12:35:00.000Z	brightspark	chris__	i'm flattered but this is the support channel
