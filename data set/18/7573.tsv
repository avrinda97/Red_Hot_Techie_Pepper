2007-12-16T00:39:00.000Z	MacTheMad		ah, well ok then... I know it works because mine is set up that way but then again I do have 3 static ip's
2007-12-16T00:41:00.000Z	MacTheMad		anyway back 2 my query... can anybody tell me why I can't change my cursor after installing the xcursor selector package and also how to change the background on my 2nd desktop w/o changing the 1st?
2007-12-16T00:41:00.000Z	jrib	MacTheMad	what window manager are you using?
2007-12-16T00:43:00.000Z	jrib	MacTheMad	if you have desktop effects enabled, you need to do it in compiz-config-settingsmanager, otherwise you are using metacity and should google "wallpapoz"
2007-12-16T00:45:00.000Z	jrib	MacTheMad	why are you not using system -> preferences -> appearance to change the mouse cursor?
2007-12-16T00:50:00.000Z	MacTheMad	jrib	when I go to system > preferences > appearance there's nothing that mentions cursors
2007-12-16T00:50:00.000Z	jrib	MacTheMad	try "customize"
2007-12-16T00:52:00.000Z	jrib	MacTheMad	no
2007-12-16T00:52:00.000Z	jrib	MacTheMad	if you have desktop effects enabled, you need to do it in compiz-config-settingsmanager, otherwise you are using metacity and should google "wallpapoz"
2007-12-16T01:04:00.000Z	MacTheMad	jrib	I've been searching around but I haven't found what setting in compiz will allow me to change the background on just the 2nd window... all I want to do is have window 1 w/ wallpaper & window 2 w/o so I can tell at a glance which I'm on
2007-12-16T01:05:00.000Z	jrib	MacTheMad	are you using the cube?
2007-12-16T01:06:00.000Z	jrib	MacTheMad	are you using desktop effects?
2007-12-16T01:07:00.000Z	jrib	MacTheMad	system -> preferences -> appearance
2007-12-16T01:09:00.000Z	MacTheMad	jrib	no I tried turning it on but it won't... only crappy s3 savage onboard graphics
2007-12-16T01:09:00.000Z	jrib	MacTheMad	then you are using metacity and need to google for "wallpapoz"
2007-12-16T01:10:00.000Z	MacTheMad	jrib	so you're saying I should install that package... should I uninstall compiz then or will it work for other things?
2007-12-16T01:11:00.000Z	jrib	MacTheMad	huh? can you rephrase that last question?
2007-12-16T01:14:00.000Z	jrib	MacTheMad	it's up to you.  compiz is unrelated since you are not using it.  wallpapoz is not packaged, you will need to follow the instructions on the author's website
