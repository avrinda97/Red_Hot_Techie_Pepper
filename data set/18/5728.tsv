2008-10-12T10:37:00.000Z	outbackwifi	balz	when you do a netstat -l | grep 10000 does it show your ip-address also?
2008-10-12T10:39:00.000Z	outbackwifi	balz	not unless you had server resolving to your ip address
2008-10-12T14:15:00.000Z	outbackwifi	balz	you will not be able to do that from inside the network; you need to ask a friend to try and connect from OUTSIDE your network
2008-10-29T21:22:00.000Z	outbackwifi	balz	tar zxvf file.tar.gz
2008-10-29T21:22:00.000Z	balz	outbackwifi	 haha thanks also!
2008-10-29T21:24:00.000Z	outbackwifi	balz	cd X / (since you asked)
2008-10-29T21:25:00.000Z	outbackwifi	balz	does it say webroot or root?
2008-10-29T21:26:00.000Z	balz	outbackwifi	 scratch that! it says www root!
2008-10-29T21:27:00.000Z	outbackwifi	balz	so copy it to the document root typically /var/www/
2008-10-29T21:29:00.000Z	balz	outbackwifi	 that's odd. i dont have a /var/www directory
2008-10-29T21:29:00.000Z	outbackwifi	balz	do you have a webserver installed?
2008-10-29T21:29:00.000Z	balz	outbackwifi	 no
2008-10-29T21:30:00.000Z	outbackwifi	balz	then how do you plan to run the webui??
2008-10-29T21:30:00.000Z	balz	outbackwifi	 jeez i  need to take the tiem to read more slowly!  it says i need a webserver in bold lol =)
2008-10-29T21:31:00.000Z	balz	outbackwifi	 can you recommend a webserver?  lgihtweight is better
2008-10-29T21:32:00.000Z	outbackwifi	balz	apache2 is fine; if you're really constrained for resources lighttpd is the way to go
2008-10-29T22:07:00.000Z	outbackwifi	balz	you want to remove the package or a printer?
2008-10-29T22:07:00.000Z	outbackwifi	balz	sudo apt-get remove cups
