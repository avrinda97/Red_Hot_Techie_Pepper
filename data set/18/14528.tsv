2007-09-03T08:51:00.000Z	lxuser_	dug	thanks
2007-09-03T08:53:00.000Z	dug	lxuser_	I mean format it, not partition it
2007-09-03T08:53:00.000Z	lxuser_	dug	i dont think that should happen, as it does as you say it should and just pops up on my other ubuntu computer
2007-09-03T08:53:00.000Z	dug	lxuser_	I would still run gnome partition editor just to see if it can see your usb hard drive at all, it sometimes mounts things when ubuntu won't
2007-09-03T08:54:00.000Z	dug	lxuser_	oh if it mounts fine on another computer with ubuntu I'm not sure then.  You could post your issue and the dmesg output to the ubuntu forum and probably get better help
2007-09-03T08:54:00.000Z	lxuser_	dug	i think i just fsucked up my fstab
2007-09-03T08:55:00.000Z	dug	lxuser_	oh well i have a usb hard drive, when i plug it in (no fstab entry), ubuntu tries to mount it.  it never can, so I manually mount it with the -o force flag.  I don't want to put an fstab entry yet
2007-09-03T09:21:00.000Z	lxuser_	dug	it says my username is invalid
2007-09-03T09:21:00.000Z	dug	lxuser_	sorry, I didn't mention to change "lxuser" with your username on your computer, i just guessed
2007-09-03T09:22:00.000Z	lxuser_	dug	i did
2007-09-03T09:22:00.000Z	dug	lxuser_	I assume you tried: "sudo chown alan:alan /media/USB"
2007-09-03T09:23:00.000Z	lxuser_	dug	i typed it in in the wrong order, silly me :p
2007-09-03T09:25:00.000Z	lxuser_	dug	it still refuses me access even after umounting it
2007-09-03T09:26:00.000Z	lxuser_	dug	i did
2007-09-03T09:27:00.000Z	lxuser_	dug	i can no longer unmount the drive, it says its busy
2007-09-03T09:27:00.000Z	lxuser_	dug	 no
2007-09-03T09:28:00.000Z	lxuser_	dug	and i can no longer unmount the drive for some reason
2007-09-03T09:29:00.000Z	dug	lxuser_	sorry man, i'm drawing a blank.
