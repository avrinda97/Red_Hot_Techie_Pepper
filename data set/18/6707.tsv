2008-04-09T08:51:00.000Z	damo23	dmsuperman	make sure you have a copy of ubuntu cd so you can install grub again after xp, then just install windows xp
2008-04-09T08:52:00.000Z	damo23	dmsuperman	yeah
2008-04-09T08:53:00.000Z	damo23	dmsuperman	 you cant install grub to the slave ide it needs to be on hd0
2008-04-09T08:54:00.000Z	damo23	dmsuperman	 you do root (hd1,5) then setup (hd0)
2008-04-09T08:55:00.000Z	damo23	dmsuperman	 correct, it needs to be on the primary drive so it boots off it
2008-04-09T08:56:00.000Z	damo23	dmsuperman	grub needs to be installed on hd0 mbr
2008-04-09T08:57:00.000Z	damo23	dmsuperman	why would you do something crazy like that
2008-04-09T08:58:00.000Z	damo23	dmsuperman	ok then if bios is set to sata1 then grub needs to be installled in hd1
