2007-07-27T06:15:00.000Z	mikebot		When I used Windows I used a LaTeX editor (LEd) which had a built in DVI viewer. Is there anything like that for ubuntu?
2007-07-27T06:16:00.000Z	vox754	mikebot	use tetex or texlive2007, xdvi works pretty well
2007-07-27T06:18:00.000Z	vox754	mikebot	a dvi previwer it is quite famous in the Unix world
2007-07-27T06:19:00.000Z	vox754	mikebot	you can use kile, or gedit or kate or vim and so. There are guides with more info in the forums. Kile seems like the best choice.
2007-07-27T06:21:00.000Z	vox754	mikebot	a built-in dvi viewer seems kind of strange. Just editing, compiling and previewing is not hard.
2007-07-27T06:23:00.000Z	vox754	mikebot	I have installed "tetex-base" and "tetex-extra", I edit my files with "gedit", compile with the terminal, "latex file", and preview with "xdvi file".
2007-07-27T06:23:00.000Z	mikebot	vox754	Ok, I'll do that..thanks.
2007-07-27T06:24:00.000Z	vox754	mikebot	yes naturally. Search the packages with "aptitude search tetex"
2007-07-27T06:28:00.000Z	vox754	mikebot	in nautilus? that is odd, I never thought of that.
2007-07-27T06:31:00.000Z	vox754	mikebot	well there is a list view, although I must say I don't recall the exact windows thing either
2007-07-27T06:31:00.000Z	mikebot	vox754	OK, thanks.
2007-07-27T06:33:00.000Z	vox754	mikebot	most probably you are using an ATI or Nvidia card so see !ati
2007-07-27T06:36:00.000Z	vox754	mikebot	you need to ask someone in your family... No. Seriously, you should know. Try "lspci -nv" and check the card.
2007-07-27T06:38:00.000Z	mikebot	vox754	VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation Mobile 945GM/GMS/940GML Express Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 03)
2007-07-27T06:39:00.000Z	vox754	mikebot	that is useful info. Now browse the forums for more info.
2007-07-27T06:40:00.000Z	mikebot	vox754	I was hoping t would be easier than that :) Thanks for your help
2007-07-27T06:41:00.000Z	vox754	mikebot	It may be easy, I just don't have personal experience with Intel. It maybe a single command, or a single edition of /etc/X11/xorg.conf, but I can't be sure.
2007-07-27T06:41:00.000Z	mikebot	vox754	Oh, OK.
