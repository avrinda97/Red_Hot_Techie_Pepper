2008-12-21T11:45:00.000Z	qr		Is there an MS Paint clone for linux?
2008-12-21T11:45:00.000Z	raylu	qr	imagemagick and graphicsmagick for simple image transforms, gimp for drawing
2008-12-21T11:46:00.000Z	qr	raylu	gimp is too heavy for what I want to do.  I just want to do simple pixel sketches.

2008-12-21T11:57:00.000Z	qr	raylu	that was very helpful, thanks. xpaint is just what I need.
2008-12-21T11:57:00.000Z	raylu	qr	<3 google
2008-12-21T12:11:00.000Z	raylu	qr	gedit is lightweight? hah
2008-12-21T12:12:00.000Z	qr	raylu	it is for a gui editor
2008-12-21T12:12:00.000Z	raylu	qr	i'd recommend vim right now, but that might not be such a good idea
2008-12-21T12:12:00.000Z	raylu	qr	emacs/vim running in xterm is lighter :D
2008-12-21T12:12:00.000Z	qr	raylu	don't worry, I'm not an emacs zellot, I'm one of the rare people who use both
2008-12-21T12:16:00.000Z	raylu	qr	why would firefox leave a lock in /var?
2008-12-21T12:16:00.000Z	qr	raylu	lots of things put lock files in var
2008-12-21T12:16:00.000Z	raylu	qr	er... don't users not have write access to /var?
2008-12-21T12:17:00.000Z	qr	raylu	my /var/lock is 777 and I don't think I would have changed that manually
2008-12-21T12:18:00.000Z	raylu	qr	it...shouldn't be
2008-12-21T12:20:00.000Z	qr	raylu	oh really? I've always thought /var/lock was The Place To Put Lock Files (TM), although it seems that only apache is using it on my machine, so I may be wrong.
2008-12-21T12:21:00.000Z	raylu	qr	apache starts as root
