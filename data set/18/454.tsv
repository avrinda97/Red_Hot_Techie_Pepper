2012-09-03T19:17:00.000Z	deadmund	a8s0lut0	the open source driver is called 'radeon'
2012-09-03T19:17:00.000Z	a8s0lut0	deadmund	  how do i verify i'm running that, or run it if i'm not?
2012-09-03T19:18:00.000Z	deadmund	a8s0lut0	Look at the output of lspci -k  under your grahpics card for the 'driver in use'
2012-09-03T19:18:00.000Z	deadmund	a8s0lut0	If you have trouble reading it pastebinit and i"ll interpret it: paste.ubuntu.com
2012-09-03T19:19:00.000Z	deadmund	a8s0lut0	there's ur answer.  If you don't trust it use lsmod | grep radeon
2012-09-03T19:19:00.000Z	deadmund	a8s0lut0	Just lspci and lsmod over compiz-check
2012-09-03T19:20:00.000Z	deadmund	a8s0lut0	**trust lspci and lsmod over compiz-check**
2012-09-03T19:20:00.000Z	deadmund	a8s0lut0	what do you  mean it doesn't work?
2012-09-03T19:22:00.000Z	deadmund	a8s0lut0	Can you be more specific?
2012-09-03T19:23:00.000Z	deadmund	a8s0lut0	Well, you're going to have to be more specific than, "it's weird"
2012-09-03T19:25:00.000Z	deadmund	a8s0lut0	there ya go!
2012-09-03T19:26:00.000Z	a8s0lut0	deadmund	i can't move any windows around because the titlebar areas all disappear
2012-09-03T19:27:00.000Z	deadmund	a8s0lut0	that's the window decorator plugin.  Make sure it's on!
2012-09-03T19:27:00.000Z	deadmund	a8s0lut0	great, it's working.  Now you just have to turn on / configure the right plugins.  Def turn on window decorations.  You can also hold down alt and click + drag windows even without the decorator
2012-09-03T19:29:00.000Z	a8s0lut0	deadmund	awesome! that brought the titlebars back, still can't drag around.  will mess around..
2012-09-03T19:29:00.000Z	deadmund	a8s0lut0	there is another plugin called 'move'
2012-09-03T19:30:00.000Z	a8s0lut0	deadmund	lol wow, a plugin for "move".  That worked!  Maybe I should pull out the compiz "manual"
2012-09-03T19:31:00.000Z	deadmund	a8s0lut0	haha  I think that gui configuring thing is the manual
