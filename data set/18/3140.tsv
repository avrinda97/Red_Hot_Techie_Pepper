2009-12-02T08:34:00.000Z	dylanpatterson		oh sorry. ubuntu 9.1
2009-12-02T08:36:00.000Z	dylanpatterson		i think i just need drivers
2009-12-02T08:37:00.000Z	dylanpatterson		yes lspci sees it
2009-12-02T08:38:00.000Z	mezquitale	dylanpatterson	there is a bug with the software for your driver, you could use backports: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/289014
2009-12-02T08:42:00.000Z	mezquitale	dylanpatterson	youre using karmic, right? 9.10?
2009-12-02T08:43:00.000Z	dylanpatterson	mezquitale	im using ubuntu 9.10
2009-12-02T08:46:00.000Z	mezquitale	dylanpatterson	problem is the drivers should already be installed in karmic, type modprobe -l |grep ath5k
2009-12-02T08:46:00.000Z	mezquitale	dylanpatterson	in a terminal type "mod probe -l | grep ath5k"
2009-12-02T08:49:00.000Z	dylanpatterson	mezquitale	ok. popped up kernel/driver/net/wireless/ath/ath5k/ath5k.ko
2009-12-02T08:50:00.000Z	mezquitale	dylanpatterson	type "iwconfig"and give us the results using paste bin

2009-12-02T08:57:00.000Z	mezquitale	dylanpatterson	your wireless card is up and running just up, thank you very much, that'll be 5 euros please
2009-12-02T08:58:00.000Z	dylanpatterson	mezquitale	lol! The little wifi button is still orange.. but it say wireless networks available
2009-12-02T08:59:00.000Z	mezquitale	dylanpatterson	only windows blindly connects you to any wireless connection available, you have to configure your card to work with your router, do you have a network router?
2009-12-02T09:00:00.000Z	dylanpatterson	mezquitale	 yeah but i use it in many different areas..  what if im in an airport and dont have access to the router..?
2009-12-02T09:01:00.000Z	mezquitale	dylanpatterson	you can double click on network manager, it should be somewhere in your task bar all the way to the right, if you see a network name with a little lock on it, it means it has security enabled
