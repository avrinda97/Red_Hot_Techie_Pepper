2005-11-07T17:00:00.000Z	marcin		and the problem is that I can see polish letters in gnome-terminal, in emacs buffers, on console
2005-11-07T17:00:00.000Z	marcin		but not in xterm
2005-11-07T17:00:00.000Z	marcin		and not in emacs w3m web browser
2005-11-07T17:01:00.000Z	marcin		I use terminus font so it should show polish letters but I got empty spaces...
2005-11-07T17:01:00.000Z	marcin		could someone help me with this thing?
2005-11-07T17:01:00.000Z	bob2	marcin	then it probably doesn't have those characters
2005-11-07T17:01:00.000Z	marcin	bob2	it definetly has
2005-11-07T17:02:00.000Z	marcin	bob2	I got two terminals - gnome-terminal with font set to terminus and xterm with the same font
2005-11-07T17:02:00.000Z	bob2	marcin	did yo urun xterm with -u8?
2005-11-07T17:02:00.000Z	marcin	bob2	I got polish letters in gnome-terminal and I don't in xterm
2005-11-07T17:03:00.000Z	marcin	bob2	I did now and no effect
2005-11-07T17:41:00.000Z	marcin	bob2	hi it's me again - sorry to bother
2005-11-07T17:42:00.000Z	marcin	bob2	but you were propably right
2005-11-07T17:42:00.000Z	marcin	bob2	I installed almost every package that was related with 'locale'
2005-11-07T17:42:00.000Z	marcin	bob2	and now I think that I'm close to solve my problem
2005-11-07T17:43:00.000Z	marcin	bob2	the thing is that I started xterm with -en iso8859-2 option
2005-11-07T17:44:00.000Z	marcin	bob2	and it says now that "Warning: couldn't find charset data for locale pl_PL.UTF-8; using ISO 8859-1."
2005-11-07T17:44:00.000Z	marcin	bob2	maybe you know what can I do with this thing?
