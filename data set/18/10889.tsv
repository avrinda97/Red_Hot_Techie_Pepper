2006-10-12T09:15:00.000Z	Dionys		is there anybody who can help me with the webcam ? :)
2006-10-12T09:16:00.000Z	Managu	Dionys	 Just a silly question -- does the user you're logged into have permission to use /dev/video0?
2006-10-12T09:19:00.000Z	Dionys	Managu	normally yes :)
2006-10-12T09:20:00.000Z	Managu	Dionys	mmkay, just a thought.
2006-10-12T09:20:00.000Z	Dionys	Managu	there wasnt a video group do
2006-10-12T09:21:00.000Z	Managu	Dionys	mmm?
2006-10-12T09:21:00.000Z	Managu	Dionys	Sorry, couldn't parse your sentence: "There wasn't a video group do"
2006-10-12T09:23:00.000Z	Managu	Dionys	ahh, in that case the video device might not be set to be accessible by the video group
2006-10-12T09:24:00.000Z	Managu	Dionys	if you "ls -l /dev/video*", what do you get?
2006-10-12T09:25:00.000Z	Managu	Dionys	and touch /dev/video0 ?
2006-10-12T09:27:00.000Z	Managu	Dionys	good, just as expected.
2006-10-12T09:28:00.000Z	Managu	Dionys	I suspect your drivers.  I'd take a look through the output of dmesg
2006-10-12T09:28:00.000Z	Managu	Dionys	no dumb thing.  Just gotta check them first (permissions, etc).
2006-10-12T09:30:00.000Z	Managu	Dionys	I'll take a look, but lemme warn yas, I have no experience with webcams under linux
2006-10-12T09:32:00.000Z	Managu	Dionys	what tool are you using to test the cam?
2006-10-12T09:33:00.000Z	Managu	Dionys	heh, never heard of it.  When you run it, you get...?
2006-10-12T09:34:00.000Z	Managu	Dionys	sec
2006-10-12T09:39:00.000Z	Managu	Dionys	my thought is to try running xawtv or some other v4l program against the camera to see if it'll yield more info
