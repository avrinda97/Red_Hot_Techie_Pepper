2009-09-19T12:04:00.000Z	titan_ark	Jeruvy	I presently have Ubuntu on a partition of my laptop hdd
2009-09-19T12:05:00.000Z	titan_ark		i want to remove ubuntu and retain vista
2009-09-19T12:05:00.000Z	Jeruvy	titan_ark	did you do a non-wubi install?  Then just format the partition.
2009-09-19T12:06:00.000Z	titan_ark	Jeruvy	yes its a non wubi install that I am using now. But then wat abt the grub? i would like to get my old mbr back too
2009-09-19T12:06:00.000Z	titan_ark		i dont have a vista installation disc cos it came oem installed
2009-09-19T12:06:00.000Z	Jeruvy	titan_ark	ah. from a windows CD, run fixmbr
2009-09-19T12:07:00.000Z	titan_ark	Jeruvy	:( i dont have the disc. I have a recovery drive created by HP, but the damn thing doesnt give me a cli to run fixmbr!
2009-09-19T12:07:00.000Z	Jeruvy	titan_ark	that will work too :)
2009-09-19T12:08:00.000Z	Jeruvy	titan_ark	oh, so you don't have a installed recovery console?  then your pooched
2009-09-19T12:08:00.000Z	titan_ark	Jeruvy	but it doesnt throw up the cli. i get a gui that asks me if I want to restore to factory settings or restore to an old date
