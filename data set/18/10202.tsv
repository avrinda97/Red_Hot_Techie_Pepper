2007-01-06T10:59:00.000Z	xtknight		we're going to wipe his boot sector first
2007-01-06T10:59:00.000Z	xtknight		(first 440 bytes excluding partition table)
2007-01-06T10:59:00.000Z	variant	xtknight	why? thats what installing grub to it will do
2007-01-06T11:00:00.000Z	variant	xtknight	reinstalling grub will do that
2007-01-06T11:03:00.000Z	variant	xtknight	why do you want him to mount windows?
2007-01-06T11:05:00.000Z	variant	xtknight	no, you said mount /dev/hda1 /mnt/linux.. hda1 is his windows part
2007-01-27T12:59:00.000Z	variant	xtknight	yeah i typed that like 3 lines before you
2007-01-27T13:00:00.000Z	xtknight	variant	ahh ;)
2007-01-28T11:37:00.000Z	variant	xtknight	im trying to jam pizza in my mouth at the same time :)
2007-01-28T11:38:00.000Z	xtknight	variant	well i won the command typing contest *flexes muscles* :P
2007-01-28T11:39:00.000Z	variant	xtknight	they are not just for beginners..
2007-01-28T11:40:00.000Z	xtknight	variant	very true.  i couldn't make a 3d game to save my life
2007-02-14T10:11:00.000Z	variant	xtknight	vista is a chrome plated turd imo
2007-03-24T15:13:00.000Z	xtknight	variant	i agree
2007-03-24T15:14:00.000Z	variant	xtknight	not many people seem to understand what it really means to have 64bit vs 32..they seem to think it means a massive speed increase or something.. (i had simmilar miss understandings untill i read up on the subject the other day)
2007-03-24T15:14:00.000Z	xtknight	variant	other way around for the latest intel CPUs, as a matter of fact.  64 has some gains in floating point ops
2007-03-24T15:14:00.000Z	xtknight	variant	but mostly yes 32 is faster
2007-03-24T15:15:00.000Z	variant	xtknight	yeah but its not optimal
