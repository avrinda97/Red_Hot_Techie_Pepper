2008-11-21T08:03:00.000Z	fluvvell	keewee	any luck from lspci ? does that list your card
2008-11-21T08:03:00.000Z	keewee	fluvvell	nope, it doesn't. it is turned off, i suppose
2008-11-21T08:05:00.000Z	fluvvell	keewee	as mindrape has suggested it needs to be powered on. Bios?
2008-11-21T08:07:00.000Z	fluvvell	keewee	and lspci ?
2008-11-21T08:08:00.000Z	fluvvell	keewee	as in the whole wireless network just works? No more problems?
2008-11-21T08:09:00.000Z	fluvvell	keewee	or the light now glows?
2008-11-21T08:09:00.000Z	keewee	fluvvell	I meant it connected to my wireless
2008-11-21T08:10:00.000Z	fluvvell	keewee	great news.
2008-11-21T08:11:00.000Z	keewee	fluvvell	then I pressed fnf2 and it turned the adapter off and on again... now it doesn't do that sequence of "restarting wireless card" but it doesn't find networks.. fnf2 again and it turns the adapter on again (without turning off :s ) cannot find networks..
2008-11-21T08:12:00.000Z	fluvvell	keewee	there should be a time delay after turning it on before it finds networks. All scans take some time.
2008-11-21T08:13:00.000Z	fluvvell	keewee	is the adaptor in roaming mode?
2008-11-21T08:14:00.000Z	keewee	fluvvell	I waited the normal time it always takes to find networks (10-20sec).
2008-11-21T08:15:00.000Z	keewee	fluvvell	in iwconfig it appears as ra0, so I used ra0 for your command..
2008-11-21T08:17:00.000Z	fluvvell	keewee	what happens if you click the wireless icon at the top?
2008-11-21T08:19:00.000Z	keewee	fluvvell	the icon is for both wireless and ethernet. the wireless part of the menu appears (which normally disappears when the wireless adapter is turned off).
2008-11-21T08:19:00.000Z	keewee	fluvvell	but no networks..
2008-11-21T08:22:00.000Z	keewee	fluvvell	I found that the eeepc-hotkey.sh file has changed...  dunno why. will try putting the correct one back
2008-11-21T08:22:00.000Z	fluvvell	keewee	i'll leave you with mindrape - i have to go.
