2010-04-05T10:28:00.000Z	amstan		hey guys.. i have a weird problem, i'm trying to deactivate the pc beep, but sudo rmmod pcspkr gives me "ERROR: Module pcspkr does not exist in /proc/modules "
2010-04-05T10:29:00.000Z	maginot	amstan	setterm -blength 0
2010-04-05T10:30:00.000Z	amstan	maginot	i forgot to mention, when i try hitting backspace in the terminals it's fine, it doesn't beep
2010-04-05T10:30:00.000Z	amstan		but when i do that in pidgin it does
2010-04-05T10:30:00.000Z	amstan		setterm doesn't seem to have any effect
2010-04-05T10:31:00.000Z	maginot	amstan	put that on your ~/.profile together with setterm -bfreq 0
2010-04-05T10:32:00.000Z	maginot	amstan	and you could also try for pidgin "xset b"
2010-04-05T10:33:00.000Z	maginot		!pidgin
2010-04-05T10:36:00.000Z	amstan	maginot	yep.. no change
2010-04-05T10:37:00.000Z	maginot	amstan	did you also tried changing the pcspeaker volume on alsamixer?
2010-04-05T10:38:00.000Z	amstan	maginot	i have no slider for that
2010-04-05T10:38:00.000Z	maginot	amstan	try on the console
2010-04-05T10:38:00.000Z	amstan	maginot	there's a "Beep" slider but it's on 0
2010-04-05T10:39:00.000Z	amstan	maginot	?
2010-04-05T10:39:00.000Z	maginot	amstan	I don't know what else to tell you... are you sure is pcspkr beep and not some sound configuration on pidgin ?
2010-04-05T10:40:00.000Z	amstan	maginot	this happens on other windows too
2010-04-05T10:40:00.000Z	maginot	amstan	my "beep" is mutted on alsamixer... try that too
2010-04-05T10:41:00.000Z	amstan	maginot	and why didn't i think of that? lol
