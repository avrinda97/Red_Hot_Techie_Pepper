2010-01-22T21:23:00.000Z	tuxsun		back for a few... suggestions on troubleshooting the Remote Desktop Viewer?  1 pc is running 9.10 and the other is 8.04 LTS ... both sytems up-to-date
2010-01-22T21:24:00.000Z	soreau	tuxsun	What are you trying and what is not working?
2010-01-22T21:25:00.000Z	tuxsun	soreau	the Find button in remote viewer finds nothing when I click on Domain and select local
2010-01-22T21:26:00.000Z	tuxsun	soreau	if I enter the IP address of the other pc in the Host field  i.e. 192.169.102 ... it fails to connect
2010-01-22T21:26:00.000Z	soreau	tuxsun	Cant you specify the IP?
2010-01-22T21:26:00.000Z	soreau	tuxsun	Can you ping that IP?
2010-01-22T21:26:00.000Z	tuxsun	soreau	yes, it pings and I can ssh into it and do remote admin
2010-01-22T21:27:00.000Z	soreau	tuxsun	Did you configure the machine in sys>prefs>remote desktop?
2010-01-22T21:27:00.000Z	tuxsun		yes, both machines are configured to ask for a password
2010-01-22T21:28:00.000Z	tuxsun	soreau	I can't find any documentation on the settings anywhere
2010-01-22T21:28:00.000Z	soreau	tuxsun	The settings for what?
2010-01-22T21:28:00.000Z	tuxsun	soreau	is there a HOW-TO or FAQ anywhere for Remoter Desktop Viewer?
2010-01-22T21:29:00.000Z	soreau	tuxsun	I dont know, someone would have to google..
2010-01-22T21:29:00.000Z	tuxsun		I have a lot of experience with PUTTY and ssh on UNIX and Windows... so I'm not exactly a newbie to this
2010-01-22T21:30:00.000Z	soreau	tuxsun	How I usually set it up is in sys>prefs>remote desktop, configure it to accept connections so I can connect to it from another machine
2010-01-22T21:30:00.000Z	soreau	tuxsun	Then vino should be running and should allow you to connect. Try restarting the vino service
2010-01-22T21:31:00.000Z	tuxsun	soreau	good idea, I have not checked the service...
2010-01-22T21:49:00.000Z	tuxsun	soreau	I mispoke... the machines saw each other yesterday before I replaced CentOS with Ubuntu 8.04 LTS on the machine and now they can't see each other. hmmm....
