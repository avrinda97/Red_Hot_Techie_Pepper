2006-09-07T13:05:00.000Z	Mouldy		anyone know of a command to see all devices/computers connected to the network?
2006-09-07T13:06:00.000Z	Mouldy		how do I find the IP address of my printer (connected via network)?
2006-09-07T13:06:00.000Z	kitche	Mouldy	print a test page if it's on a network printer
2006-09-07T13:07:00.000Z	kitche	Mouldy	by pressing the button on the print server
2006-09-07T13:07:00.000Z	Mouldy	kitche	the printer hasn't been installed yet, that's why I need the IP address...and the printer has a built in print-server
2006-09-07T13:07:00.000Z	kitche	Mouldy	try printing a tst page those usually give the ip of them
2006-09-07T13:08:00.000Z	Mouldy	kitche	ok, I'll give it a go.
2006-09-07T13:09:00.000Z	Mouldy	kitche	I just get an "Error while printing" message
2006-09-07T13:09:00.000Z	kitche	Mouldy	well did you walk over to the printer, or are you trying to do it though ubuntu?
2006-09-07T13:10:00.000Z	Mouldy	kitche	Through ubuntu...there isn't a test-page setting on the printer though AFAIK
2006-09-07T13:11:00.000Z	kitche	Mouldy	there is a test page button try turning off the printer then press down the power button for 3 seconds then let go it might print a test page
