2008-04-30T12:32:00.000Z	xxxxxxx		what is the purpose of the minimal.iso?
2008-04-30T12:33:00.000Z	xxxxxxx		should i use the minimal?
2008-04-30T12:33:00.000Z	xxxxxxx		its only 9.5mb where does the os come from is it downloaded?
2008-04-30T12:33:00.000Z	xxxxxxx		ok i thought so
2008-04-30T12:34:00.000Z	xxxxxxx		just that one app
2008-04-30T12:34:00.000Z	xxxxxxx		I need it to boot into it and shut down from it
2008-04-30T12:34:00.000Z	Jordan_U	xxxxxxx	Then just install the base system and install that one app
2008-04-30T12:34:00.000Z	xxxxxxx		so minimal.iso would be a good starting point?
2008-04-30T12:35:00.000Z	Jordan_U	xxxxxxx	Yes, if you are comfortable setting things up from a command line
2008-04-30T12:35:00.000Z	xxxxxxx		ok jordan the only thing im not sure about are drivers
2008-04-30T12:36:00.000Z	xxxxxxx		when i installed heron I had to click on hardware drivers to find the ati driver for the amd 780g
2008-04-30T12:36:00.000Z	xxxxxxx		is it possible to install the driver from the command line?
2008-04-30T12:36:00.000Z	xxxxxxx		can i check to find out which driver i have installed?
2008-04-30T12:37:00.000Z	xxxxxxx	ikonia	what about all the stuff in the desktop that I don't need?
2008-04-30T12:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	xxxxxxx	sudo apt-get install xorg-driver-fglrx ( if you have an ATI card )
2008-04-30T12:37:00.000Z	xxxxxxx		also is x11 the same as x or xorg?
2008-04-30T12:37:00.000Z	xxxxxxx		I think xbmc linux needs an x server
2008-04-30T12:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U	xxxxxxx	It does
