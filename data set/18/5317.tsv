2009-06-19T10:22:00.000Z	rodders		hi anyone around who knows about rsync?
2009-06-19T10:22:00.000Z	rodders		I need to sync my music (held on ext2) onto an external vfat drive, somehow rsync not giving me the necessary results
2009-06-19T10:23:00.000Z	rodders		rsync -rv /media/music/  /media/ext_drive/music
2009-06-19T10:24:00.000Z	rodders		it seems to be sync n sync every file BTW ext_drive is vfat, so permissions are a prob.  (tried unison)
2009-06-19T10:24:00.000Z	rodders		yes music is caps
2009-06-19T10:24:00.000Z	rodders		yes, it transfer ok
2009-06-19T10:25:00.000Z	Roasted	rodders	- so you do get some transfer?
2009-06-19T10:22:00.000Z	Roasted	rodders	- sure, whatcha need?
2009-06-19T10:23:00.000Z	Roasted	rodders	- what rsync command are you typing in?
2009-06-19T10:24:00.000Z	Roasted	rodders	- is Music capitalized? That may make a difference
2009-06-19T10:24:00.000Z	Roasted	rodders	- are you sure your external drive is mounted to /media/ext_drive/?
2009-06-19T10:26:00.000Z	Roasted	rodders	- how much music do you have, if you had to estimate? 10gb? 30gb?
2009-06-19T10:26:00.000Z	Roasted	rodders	- it sure may. considering that you are doing this by command line.
2009-06-19T10:26:00.000Z	Roasted	rodders	- how long does it take when you run your rsync script?
2009-06-19T10:28:00.000Z	Roasted	rodders	- between the 1st and 2nd time you ran the rsync command, did you make a lot of changes to your music? Becuase any changes you make (modification times, renaming folders, etc) will be re-copied when you run rsync again
2009-06-19T10:31:00.000Z	Roasted	rodders	- it'll by nature sync everything again, but it shouldn't take DAYS to go. I run an rsync script which syncs data across 4 SATA hard drives in my system... it takes about a minute to run the script if nothing major was changed
2009-06-19T10:32:00.000Z	Roasted	rodders	- what was your rsync command again?
2009-06-19T10:33:00.000Z	Roasted	rodders	- now wiat... do you run 1 command for each directory of music? Or do you run 1 command for ALL music?
