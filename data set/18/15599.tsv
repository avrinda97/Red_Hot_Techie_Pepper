2005-03-17T17:03:00.000Z	mactiny		there didnt seem to be an option ot set the root pass during install
2005-03-17T17:03:00.000Z	mactiny		or am i missing something
2005-03-17T17:03:00.000Z	ompaul	mactiny	you can launch the "root terminal"
2005-03-17T17:05:00.000Z	ompaul	mactiny	the concept is that you use sudo for root tasks and not give a password to root so youy can sudo su - if you really feel like being root
2005-03-17T17:06:00.000Z	ompaul	mactiny	 sudo, sudoedit - execute a command as another user
2005-03-17T17:16:00.000Z	ompaul	mactiny	really the problem is with people buying from suppliers that sell hardware that does not work with linux
2005-03-17T17:18:00.000Z	ompaul	mactiny	well I have always insisted on serial just to make the point for over last 10 years
2005-03-17T17:22:00.000Z	ompaul	mactiny	only in the mind of the viewer :)
2005-03-17T17:24:00.000Z	ompaul	mactiny	you defeat your own arguement., the non enthusiast is not going to explore themes or at least will go back to the original
2005-03-17T17:26:00.000Z	ompaul	mactiny	the real situation here is that you are spoilt for choice - you can import your own desktop background, for instance I use nasa images
2005-03-17T17:29:00.000Z	ompaul	mactiny	and you change car and the indicator is in a different location, the wipers too the petrol tank you adapt there is a minor price for the change - if you are not willing to pay it then maybe just maybe you need to do some more thinking about what it is you need a computer for and why it is you are using one in the first place
2005-03-17T17:30:00.000Z	ompaul	mactiny	if you want such things document them, go to the ubuntu site get a logon, join in the ideas pool
2005-03-17T17:37:00.000Z	ompaul	mactiny	I evangelise linux a `lot` I think that that perception is changing, after all who ever got sacked for buying $TLA :) it happens
2005-03-17T17:40:00.000Z	ompaul	mactiny	GNU/Linux is open and a herd of cats as Linus said, so go commit yourself to it
2005-03-17T17:43:00.000Z	ompaul	mactiny	on different boxes I use slightly different themes :) so one of the boxes here is default bog standard no frills etc
