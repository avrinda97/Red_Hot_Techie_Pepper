2009-12-26T03:07:00.000Z	adac		Is there a power save option that disables compiz automatically when I'm running on battery?
2009-12-26T03:07:00.000Z	adac		If not, wouldn't that make sense?
2009-12-26T03:08:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	adac	I would imagine it is possible. You'd have to look for the script and add that to the command. I'd suggest for you to write your own script, that way, you can add/remove more than just compiz.
2009-12-26T03:12:00.000Z	adac	mobi-sheep	guess it wouldn't be that hard to write. But in my opinion this 'script' should be added to the powersave options
2009-12-26T03:14:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	adac	You can request for it on Ubuntu Brainstorm. I recall somebody requesting the power manager to have "Do Nothing" feature too.  Also, to disable compiz to shave few minutes off? While you're at it, two gnome-panels is using more processes than one gnome-panel. You get the idea.
2009-12-26T03:16:00.000Z	adac	mobi-sheep	sorry don't understand the last gnome-panel part.
2009-12-26T03:18:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	adac	Do you use htop? There are a list of processes that you probably does not need to have it running such as gnome-screensaver. I have that package uninstalled.
2009-12-26T03:19:00.000Z	adac	mobi-sheep	I see now!
2009-12-26T03:22:00.000Z	adac	mobi-sheep	Do you think disabling compiz while I'm on battery really would save me only a very few minutes?
2009-12-26T03:23:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	adac	I don't know. I like having compiz running. You would have to do a trial run. :)
2009-12-26T03:25:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	adac	Have you thought about buying extended battery cells? I have one for my netbook. I don't really know its battery life but I have seen "10 hours" and I don't know if I want to believe that. :o
2009-12-26T03:25:00.000Z	adac	mobi-sheep	:) Well maybe it would not bad to have an "advanced" power management. Mean not only compiz to control with but multiple apps and services or gnome-panels
2009-12-26T03:25:00.000Z	adac	mobi-sheep	nah I'm fine with my 8 hours ;) was just an idea :)
2009-12-26T03:28:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	adac	It is easier to write a script.  There are only few parameters. That way, you could do "metacity --replace, killall <processes>, that's about it."  Eventually, you might realized you don't really need few processes in first place and started to weed them out.
2009-12-26T03:29:00.000Z	adac	mobi-sheep	Sure one should start with erasing programs or services that are not needed.
2009-12-26T03:31:00.000Z	adac	mobi-sheep	script is fine. It is just: power managemnt already has t check if I'm on battery or not, so it would be nice if compiz switcher could work on top of that acpi or however it is called
2009-12-26T03:34:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	adac	http://projects.gnome.org/gnome-power-manager/ + http://live.gnome.org/GnomeScreensaver/ -- You might have some luck finding out how to run scripts after certain events.
