2005-11-03T13:49:00.000Z	pramz		ive been using Aqua Data Studio but its quite slow
2005-11-03T13:50:00.000Z	FireCat	pramz	I found something called aqua or something like that. You can google for it, but I haven't tried it much yet
2005-11-03T13:50:00.000Z	FireCat	pramz	Sorry, slow eyes
2005-11-03T13:51:00.000Z	pramz	FireCat	Aqua Data Studio works well but its Java based and can get very slow :(
2005-11-03T13:53:00.000Z	FireCat	pramz	I asked Toad ( Quest)  if they would release something for linux and they pretty much laughed at me. I thought it was worth a try :)
2005-11-03T13:53:00.000Z	pramz	FireCat	heh ya man I feel ya on some of the cool software available for windows and they dont release it for linux :~(
2005-11-03T13:54:00.000Z	pramz	FireCat	hopefully someone will write a _good_ multi database client ui based on gtk/mono :)
2005-11-03T13:54:00.000Z	FireCat	pramz	I also tried to get a licence for Tora, and found out they aren't giving them out
2005-11-03T13:56:00.000Z	pramz	FireCat	a db client ui with tabbled query windows, tree list for tables, sprocs and other db objects and code completion in the query window with multiple database support would be so awesome :-) If i knew how to code I would so do it :(
