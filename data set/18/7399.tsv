2008-06-01T14:55:00.000Z	d_mitry	Starnestommy	i was told that the manager is already running. maybe i'm trying to do the wrong thing. how could i switch to the graphics mode if i chose to log in from the console?
2008-06-01T14:55:00.000Z	Starnestommy	d_mitry	ctrl+alt+f7
2008-06-01T14:55:00.000Z	d_mitry	Starnestommy	that does nothing.
2008-06-01T14:56:00.000Z	Starnestommy	d_mitry	try running startx &
2008-06-01T14:56:00.000Z	d_mitry	Starnestommy	would i need to quit irssi to try that ccombination?
2008-06-01T14:56:00.000Z	Starnestommy	d_mitry	probably not
2008-06-01T14:56:00.000Z	d_mitry	Starnestommy	in that case, it doesn nothing.
2008-06-01T14:56:00.000Z	Starnestommy	d_mitry	run ps aux | grep X
2008-06-01T14:57:00.000Z	d_mitry	Starnestommy	would it be possible to use the console at the same time as using irssi? i'm thinking i could do that using screen, but that'd mean i'd have to disconnect again.
2008-06-01T14:58:00.000Z	Starnestommy	d_mitry	you could use screen or have several consoles.  Just use Ctrl+Alt+F<number> to switch
2008-06-01T14:58:00.000Z	Starnestommy	d_mitry	i.e. the first terminal is Ctrl+Alt+F1 and the sixth is Ctrl+Alt+F6
2008-06-01T14:58:00.000Z	d_mitry	Starnestommy	ok. "process 0 (ps aux | grep X) terminated with return code 0"
2008-06-01T14:59:00.000Z	Starnestommy	d_mitry	what about "ps aux | grep ?dm" ?
2008-06-01T15:01:00.000Z	d_mitry	Starnestommy	same thing. was it correct of me to change ?dm to kdm-kde4?
2008-06-01T15:01:00.000Z	Starnestommy	d_mitry	just keep it as ?dm
2008-06-01T15:03:00.000Z	d_mitry	Starnestommy	actually, i don't think that's what i'm supposed to say. well, it said the same thing as before.
2008-06-01T15:04:00.000Z	Starnestommy	d_mitry	I'm not sure what's going on or how to fix it
2008-06-01T15:05:00.000Z	d_mitry	Starnestommy	alright! thanks for your help. :)
