2005-05-20T07:45:00.000Z	or1on		does anyone have any experience with gdesklets under ubuntu hoary?
2005-05-20T07:45:00.000Z	or1on		well, here's the problem:
2005-05-20T07:46:00.000Z	or1on		I just installed it thru apt
2005-05-20T07:46:00.000Z	or1on		gdesklets and gdesklets-data
2005-05-20T07:46:00.000Z	or1on		but when I try to open a .display-file, the gdesklets-shell just opens and stays empty
2005-05-20T07:46:00.000Z	or1on		nothing hapens
2005-05-20T07:46:00.000Z	or1on		*happens*
2005-05-20T07:47:00.000Z	Seveas	or1on	, and if you try to enable it from within gdesklets?
2005-05-20T07:49:00.000Z	or1on	Seveas	the only thing I can do from the shell is: use the menu to install a package, and click on the 2 buttons (but even then nothing happens)
2005-05-20T07:49:00.000Z	or1on	Seveas	the list above the buttons is empty also
2005-05-20T07:56:00.000Z	Seveas	or1on	rm -r (r means recursive) is the way. but it's dangerous so be careful :)
2005-05-20T07:58:00.000Z	or1on	Seveas	found it! it was an installation fault. After fully deleting the folder and reinstalling it's a go :-p
2005-05-24T15:03:00.000Z	Seveas	or1on	state the problem :)
2005-05-24T15:04:00.000Z	or1on	Seveas	hte problem is that I'm trying to mount an fat32-partition, and I state in the options that it should be "rw" but I still can't write to it
2005-05-24T15:04:00.000Z	Seveas	or1on	ah :)
2005-05-24T15:05:00.000Z	Seveas	or1on	take that line, change hda7 to your drive and change dennis to your login
2005-05-24T15:06:00.000Z	or1on	Seveas	what do fmask and dmask do? I'm trying to understan the beast :-)
2005-05-24T15:06:00.000Z	Seveas	or1on	they set the read/write permissions of the partition
