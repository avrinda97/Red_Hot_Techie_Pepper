2007-07-06T09:34:00.000Z	rogue780		my computer started making cuckoo noises last night, and it's been doing it every half hour since...does anyone know why this might be happening?
2007-07-06T09:35:00.000Z	Scunizi	rogue780	through the speakers? or from the box
2007-07-06T09:35:00.000Z	rogue780	Scunizi	from the speaker
2007-07-06T09:35:00.000Z	Scunizi	rogue780	are you using kde? or gnome
2007-07-06T09:36:00.000Z	rogue780	Scunizi	gnome
2007-07-06T09:36:00.000Z	Scunizi	rogue780	check dr_willis 's post to you .. that's probably where the answer lies.
2007-07-06T09:36:00.000Z	rogue780	Scunizi	dr_willis only thing I changed was I installed qcad...but I can't imagine that being the cause
2007-07-06T09:37:00.000Z	Scunizi	rogue780	does it happen when you do something specific like open or close a window, maybe click something that doesn't do anything at that time?  Almost sounds like systems sounds.
2007-07-06T09:38:00.000Z	rogue780	Scunizi	it happens every half hour on the half hour...I'm guessing it's tied to the clock
2007-07-06T09:39:00.000Z	Scunizi	rogue780	sounds like you need to check cron jobs, clock settings etc.. should be listed in your processes list .. maybe :P
2009-04-10T05:28:00.000Z	rogue780	Scunizi	9.04 recognizes both my pata and sata drives as hd<something>
2009-04-10T05:28:00.000Z	Scunizi	rogue780	really?  hardy and intrepid were all sd<something>
2009-04-10T05:29:00.000Z	rogue780	Scunizi	i don't know if it matters, but it's currently just a live cd running and the two sata drives are laptop sata drives
2009-04-10T05:30:00.000Z	Scunizi	rogue780	might be.. I don't think they've changed the sub system that drasticly again.
2009-04-10T05:35:00.000Z	Scunizi	rogue780	why are you doing that?
2009-04-10T05:35:00.000Z	Scunizi	rogue780	you can mount them to differently named locations
2009-04-10T05:36:00.000Z	Scunizi	rogue780	so say hdc1 you can mount it to /media/hdc3 if you want or change the name to /media/data
2009-04-10T05:39:00.000Z	Scunizi	rogue780	so you're going to put this windows drive in the machine..?? should work.. and yes.. windows can see linux shares and vice versa
