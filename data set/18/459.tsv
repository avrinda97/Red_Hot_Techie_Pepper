2012-02-09T09:41:00.000Z	EvilResistance	zulfan	i'd file a bug against the package, that seems to suggest there's an error in its config scripts

2012-02-09T09:45:00.000Z	EvilResistance	zulfan	as i said, file a bug against the package, as it seems the package has some configuration issues.  i'm not entirely sure how to fix your issue, unfortunately
