2007-12-16T13:37:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki		 How can I troubleshoot wine causing a segmentation fault? It happens at the initial installation, when trying to run wineprefixcreate (or winecfg)?  Thanks much! (0.9.51-winehq0-ubuntu-7.10-1)
2007-12-16T13:38:00.000Z	BarryToeman	ushimitsudoki	what errors does wine give you, if any?
2007-12-16T13:40:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki	BarryToeman	It simply says "Segmentation fault (core dump)" when running wineprefixcreate...if i try to run winecfg is gives a similar error (saying that wineprefixcreate crashed) and then terminates as well
2007-12-16T13:42:00.000Z	BarryToeman	ushimitsudoki	what happens if you rename .wine?
2007-12-16T13:42:00.000Z	BarryToeman	ushimitsudoki	the config folder for wine in your home directory
2007-12-16T13:45:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki	BarryToeman	I can rename .wine. However, I know that all the files were not created that are needed in the .wine folder
2007-12-16T13:45:00.000Z	BarryToeman	ushimitsudoki	i see...because it fails installation.
2007-12-16T13:45:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki	BarryToeman	The same error occurs if I try to create in a different name directory, or I delete .wine and try again
2007-12-16T13:46:00.000Z	ushimitsudoki	BarryToeman	yes, winecfg can not run becuase wineprefixcreate crashes
2007-12-16T13:46:00.000Z	BarryToeman	ushimitsudoki	did the wine version from the repository work?
2007-12-16T13:49:00.000Z	BarryToeman	ushimitsudoki	i mean the Ubuntu universe and not from wine.budgetdedicated.com
2007-12-16T13:51:00.000Z	BarryToeman	ushimitsudoki	i would purge your current wine installation and follow the Wine instructions from the Ubuntu wiki: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Wine
2007-12-16T13:51:00.000Z	BarryToeman	ushimitsudoki	good luck with that
2007-12-16T14:00:00.000Z	BarryToeman	ushimitsudoki	did you purge your old files and old installation first?  how did you install initially?
2007-12-16T14:04:00.000Z	BarryToeman	ushimitsudoki	well, that error you get isn't very helpful, huh?  did you remove .wine before reinstalling?  also, in synaptic you can choose which version to install (universe or winehq if you have that enabled), but you just tried that.
2007-12-16T14:04:00.000Z	BarryToeman	ushimitsudoki	i don't know what else to suggest besides trying #wine irc
2007-12-16T14:05:00.000Z	BarryToeman	ushimitsudoki	i mean #winehq
2007-12-16T14:05:00.000Z	BarryToeman	ushimitsudoki	make a post at ubuntuforums.org if winehq is worthless
