2005-02-13T07:58:00.000Z	jasonf		hey, I just installed ubuntu alongside my windows (windows is on a 120 IDE, ubuntu is on an 80gb SATA)
2005-02-13T07:58:00.000Z	jasonf		and grub locks up when I try to load it
2005-02-13T07:58:00.000Z	jasonf		I'm on the livecd right now
2005-02-13T07:58:00.000Z	jasonf		it hangs at "grub loading stage 1.5"
2005-02-13T07:58:00.000Z	randabis	jasonf	Try setting your hard drives to LBA
2005-02-13T07:59:00.000Z	jasonf	randabis	I think they already are
2005-02-13T08:00:00.000Z	jasonf	randabis	what would be step 2 if that doesn't work?
2005-02-13T08:00:00.000Z	randabis	jasonf	hmm...worth a shot to check at any rate
2005-02-13T08:00:00.000Z	randabis	jasonf	I dunno
2005-02-13T08:20:00.000Z	jasonf	randabis	i reinstalled and put my /boot on a little bit of free space on my ide drive and it works now
2005-02-13T08:20:00.000Z	randabis	jasonf	awesome
2005-02-13T08:20:00.000Z	jasonf	randabis	it's ghetto how it reboots to get X tho, what's the use in the CD, lol

2005-02-13T08:22:00.000Z	randabis	jasonf	hmm
2005-02-13T08:23:00.000Z	jasonf	randabis	the cds they sent out ... is that the "testing" version of ubuntu, or are you guys  on a completely different versioning system?
2005-02-13T08:23:00.000Z	randabis	jasonf	ubuntu "unstable" is called Hoary and is version 5.04
2005-02-13T08:53:00.000Z	jasonf	randabis	that's horrible !
2005-02-13T08:54:00.000Z	randabis	jasonf	why do you want to login as root?
