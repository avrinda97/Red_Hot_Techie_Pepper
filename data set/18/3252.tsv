2009-11-07T03:06:00.000Z	serapath1		i use sbackup but it doesnt work and i donw know what other alternatives there are or how to backup by using gui only
2009-11-07T03:07:00.000Z	SeaPhor	serapath1	do you want to backup for software issues or hardware or both?
2009-11-07T03:07:00.000Z	serapath1		@seaphor @tohuw only software
2009-11-07T03:08:00.000Z	SeaPhor	serapath1	do you have your /home on a separate partition?
2009-11-07T03:08:00.000Z	serapath1	SeaPhor	yes i have a seperate partition
2009-11-07T03:09:00.000Z	SeaPhor	serapath1	so you could do a fresh install of thye OS and all your stuff would still be there?

2009-11-07T03:11:00.000Z	serapath1	SeaPhor	so i could do a fresh installation, install the backup tool and do a restore so that all my files would be there... thats all. configurations and installed packages would be a "nice to have" but the primary goals are "gui only" and "as simple as possible"
2009-11-07T03:13:00.000Z	SeaPhor	serapath1	i am not sure you are understanding my question, if /home is onm a separate partition then you can wipe away ubuntu and re-install it fresh, and all the stuff you had would still be in your home, ....
2009-11-07T03:14:00.000Z	serapath1	SeaPhor	yes it would be, but in addition i want to backup my home dir on a seperate device

2009-11-07T03:15:00.000Z	serapath1		not sure yet which way to go next

2009-11-07T03:18:00.000Z	serapath1	SeaPhor	i dont want console, thats my primary goal.
2009-11-07T03:18:00.000Z	serapath1	SeaPhor	any idea why sbackup doesnt do its job?  any experience with grsync?
2009-11-07T03:18:00.000Z	serapath1	SeaPhor	And what about Mondo Rescue, is it gui only? doesnt seem to be
