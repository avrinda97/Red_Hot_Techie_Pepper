2006-06-08T05:33:00.000Z	abou		how can I figure out where the Mozilla / firefox plugins directory?
2006-06-08T05:34:00.000Z	_jason	abou	~/.mozilla/plugins for local and /usr/lib/firefox/plugins
2006-06-08T05:48:00.000Z	_jason	abou	have you closed all instances of firefox and started it again?
2006-06-08T05:48:00.000Z	abou	_jason	I did that several time
2006-06-08T05:48:00.000Z	_jason	abou	is this a fresh dapper install or an upgrade?
2006-06-08T05:49:00.000Z	abou	_jason	upgrade
2006-06-08T05:49:00.000Z	abou	_jason	It wasn't installed before the upgrade
2006-06-08T05:49:00.000Z	_jason	abou	did you use firefox1.5 on breezy?
2006-06-08T05:50:00.000Z	abou	_jason	no I installed firefox1.5 on dapper
2006-06-08T05:50:00.000Z	_jason	abou	what does "readlink -f $(which firefox)" say?
2006-06-08T05:51:00.000Z	abou	_jason	/opt/firefox/firefox
2006-06-08T05:52:00.000Z	_jason	abou	that means you are running a custom installation of firefox instead of the one installed through apt
2006-06-08T05:53:00.000Z	abou	_jason	I did the upgrade to firefox1.5 as per (!firefox1.5)
2006-06-08T05:53:00.000Z	abou	_jason	how can this be fixed?
2006-06-08T05:53:00.000Z	_jason	abou	ah ok, that would do it, just go to the !firefox1.5 page and follow the removal instructions
2006-06-08T05:55:00.000Z	abou	_jason	and after that I'll be back to firefox 1.0.7?
2006-06-08T05:55:00.000Z	_jason	abou	no, dapper has firefox1.5 available in apt
2006-06-08T05:56:00.000Z	abou	_jason	ok thanks
