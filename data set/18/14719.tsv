2007-10-10T09:47:00.000Z	kotau		I found the command I was looking for to see the raw dump of Wacom inputs.  navigate to /dev/input and use sudo xxd 'eventX' x being whatever number your tablet is on
2007-10-10T09:48:00.000Z	Veinor	kotau	didn't help. I checked the version and it's 2.18.1, I just don't have the sidebars.
2007-10-10T09:49:00.000Z	Veinor	kotau	yes.
2007-10-10T09:50:00.000Z	kotau	Veinor	that would remove all your configureations for nautilus....
2007-10-10T09:52:00.000Z	kotau	Veinor	hmm not sure that would affect it... what is happening about your sidebar?  I'm confused as to what is wrong
