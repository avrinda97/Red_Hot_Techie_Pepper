2007-03-05T07:18:00.000Z	quaal		when i go to install syslog i get this The following packages will be REMOVED:
2007-03-05T07:18:00.000Z	quaal		  klogd sysklogd ubuntu-minimal
2007-03-05T07:18:00.000Z	quaal		is this ok ?
2007-03-05T07:18:00.000Z	arrenlex	quaal	NO
2007-03-05T07:19:00.000Z	quaal	arrenlex	why ?
2007-03-05T07:19:00.000Z	arrenlex	quaal	Because you're removing the kernel logger, the system logger, and the ubuntu core.
2007-03-05T07:19:00.000Z	quaal	arrenlex	so you're saying i cannot install syslog on ubuntu ?
2007-03-05T07:20:00.000Z	arrenlex	quaal	That package isn't even in the repos. What are you trying to install?
2007-03-05T07:21:00.000Z	quaal	arrenlex	syslog-ng
2007-03-05T07:21:00.000Z	quaal	arrenlex	syslog is a logging daemon
2007-03-05T07:22:00.000Z	arrenlex	quaal	Hmm. If you're installing a different system logger, then it makes sense to remove the old one. Nevermind, then. I thought you were trying to install a regular package.
2007-03-05T07:22:00.000Z	quaal	arrenlex	hmm ok
2007-03-05T07:22:00.000Z	quaal	arrenlex	so it removes programs automatically that would be doing the same thing, preventing conflicts
2007-03-05T07:23:00.000Z	arrenlex	quaal	That's right. apt resolves conflicts and dependencies. That's what makes it useful.
2007-03-05T07:23:00.000Z	quaal	arrenlex	cool. thanks
2007-03-18T14:11:00.000Z	arrenlex	quaal	You close whatever's using it? Use fuser -m /media/music to find out what process.
2007-03-18T14:12:00.000Z	quaal	arrenlex	thankyou. that one goes in the command list file
2007-03-18T14:13:00.000Z	arrenlex	quaal	You can also use fuser -mk to kill it right away.
