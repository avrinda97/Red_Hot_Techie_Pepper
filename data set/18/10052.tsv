2008-06-27T22:24:00.000Z	DJAdmiral		Hey, I'm installing Ubuntu on my Dad's laptop - this is the first time I've seen the Install inside Windows option - what advantages does it have over having a separate partition for Ubuntu?

2008-06-27T22:27:00.000Z	unop	DJAdmiral	it allows you to install ubuntu without splitting up existing partitions - which can be a pain
2008-06-27T22:27:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	unop	So having not to worry about partitions is the only advantage?
2008-06-27T22:27:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	unop	Can you access files directly?
2008-06-27T22:28:00.000Z	unop	DJAdmiral	pretty much - what do you mean by access files directly?
2008-06-27T22:29:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	unop	As in if you install inside Windows with the wubi.exe utility, then windows can copy files from ubuntu without having to restart and vice-versa?
2008-06-27T22:29:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	unop	And would you be able to boot into ubuntu from within windows?
2008-06-27T22:30:00.000Z	unop	DJAdmiral	I am not sure that windows can read files off of a wubi install - as the wubi install is in a file itself
2008-06-27T22:31:00.000Z	unop	DJAdmiral	but the reverse is true .. a wubi install can read files off of a windows partition
2008-06-27T22:31:00.000Z	unop	DJAdmiral	right
2008-06-27T22:32:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	unop	I think it makes a file. There's definitely no partition involved.
2008-06-27T22:33:00.000Z	unop	DJAdmiral	thats what i think too -- if thats the case, then windows has no real ability of reading into that file
2008-06-27T22:35:00.000Z	unop	DJAdmiral	I would say no
2008-09-15T23:31:00.000Z	unop	DJAdmiral	run.  sudo apt-get clean   #and try again
2008-09-15T23:32:00.000Z	unop	DJAdmiral	how did it fail exactly?
2008-09-15T23:35:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	unop	it gave me the same error all over again
2008-09-15T23:36:00.000Z	unop	DJAdmiral	well, what commands did you run? what error are you getting?  put this up on a pastebin so we can have a look.
