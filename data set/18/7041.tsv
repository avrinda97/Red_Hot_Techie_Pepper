2008-02-14T06:47:00.000Z	maximilion_	Picachoo	OSS is close to hardware sound, and ALSA is a nice sound layer that provides compatibility and adherence to standards such as Open AL
2008-02-14T06:49:00.000Z	maximilion_	Picachoo	No no, you will get accurate sound both if you spend some time setting up OSS or emulating it with ALSA :)
2008-02-14T06:49:00.000Z	Picachoo	maximilion_	will that slow the speed of game or it will be just like windows speed?
2008-02-14T06:50:00.000Z	maximilion_	Picachoo	what you mean is System Beep I think (the small speaker on the mobo :P)
2008-02-14T06:50:00.000Z	Picachoo	maximilion_	yes
2008-02-14T06:50:00.000Z	Picachoo	maximilion_	 i use mirc and it does that
2008-02-14T06:51:00.000Z	maximilion_	Picachoo	I really have no idea if it will slow things down. I emulate OSS via ALSA and I get 156 fps in Quake 3 in 1600x1200 (not running in wine, but just an example :P)
2008-02-14T06:51:00.000Z	Picachoo	maximilion_	is quak 3 free?
2008-02-14T06:52:00.000Z	maximilion_	Picachoo	ioquake3 is (google)
2008-02-14T06:52:00.000Z	Picachoo	maximilion_	direct dl link?
2008-02-14T06:52:00.000Z	Picachoo	maximilion_	what do you use if you dont use wine?
2008-02-14T06:53:00.000Z	Picachoo	maximilion_	what do you use if you dont use wine?
2008-02-14T06:53:00.000Z	Picachoo	maximilion_	what do you use if you dont use wine?
2008-02-14T06:53:00.000Z	maximilion_	Picachoo	read please ! :(
2008-02-14T06:54:00.000Z	Picachoo	maximilion_	 iam only saying that if i installed wine and run a windows game by it. will lit be the same as windows run it?
2008-02-14T06:57:00.000Z	maximilion_	Picachoo	wine is not an emulator - it runs the intel code right off, so you should get the same CPU performance. To get the best video card performance, put in some time to get the correct Ubuntu gfx card drivers. Sound shouldn't effect graphics performance at all, but if you have a Pentium 3 sound might slow things down...
2008-02-14T06:58:00.000Z	maximilion_	Picachoo	I really can't promise anything about wine - if you want 100% compatibility and performance, run Windoze I guess - but the beauty of Linux is it's easy and safe to install things and try ! :)
