2005-03-23T12:21:00.000Z	mercurus	crimsun	yes, which program ?
2005-03-23T12:21:00.000Z	crimsun	mercurus	(you probably mean helio7)
2005-03-23T12:21:00.000Z	mercurus	crimsun	I do :)
2005-04-11T06:53:00.000Z	crimsun	mercurus	you did _not_ need to recompile your kernel.  ALSA modules are dynamically unloadable and replaceable.
2005-04-11T06:54:00.000Z	mercurus	crimsun	this particular alsa model was added in 2.6.11
2005-04-11T06:54:00.000Z	crimsun	mercurus	you mean in ALSA 1.0.8? That's available in hoary/universe's 'alsa-source'.
2005-04-11T06:54:00.000Z	mercurus	crimsun	that being as it may, it has happened ... which option have I not configured \ which modules need I modprobe in order to have fully functional HAL ?
2005-04-11T06:55:00.000Z	crimsun	mercurus	revert to a Hoary kernel (2.6.10-5-foo) and compile alsa-source
2005-04-11T06:56:00.000Z	mercurus	crimsun	I'm on Warty, so I'm not reverting anywhere.
2005-04-11T06:56:00.000Z	crimsun	mercurus	then enable capabilities.
2005-04-11T06:56:00.000Z	crimsun	mercurus	next time, use the ubuntu kernel config
2005-04-11T06:56:00.000Z	crimsun	mercurus	they're available in /boot/config-*
2005-04-11T06:57:00.000Z	mercurus	crimsun	I built the kernel using the Warty 2.6.8.1-386, but I modified it for my hardware first. Clearly I've disabled a HAL-related module \ option ... any suggestions as to which part of the conf in which I'll find it ?
2005-04-11T06:59:00.000Z	crimsun	mercurus	CONFIG_SECURITY_CAPABILITIES
2005-04-11T07:00:00.000Z	crimsun	mercurus	if that option is modularised, it gives you commoncap.ko and capability.ko
2005-04-11T07:01:00.000Z	mercurus	crimsun	champion :)
2005-04-11T07:03:00.000Z	mercurus	crimsun	thank you :)
2005-04-11T07:03:00.000Z	crimsun	mercurus	np
