2010-09-04T17:39:00.000Z	kaddi		is there a dedicated channel for apt-get issues?
2010-09-04T17:41:00.000Z	ChogyDan	kaddi	what's the problem?
2010-09-04T17:42:00.000Z	kaddi	ChogyDan	I'm trying to find out why  sudo apt-get remove --purge 2.6.31-14 would remove the kernels 31-10, 31-11, 31-14 and 31-19
2010-09-04T17:42:00.000Z	kaddi	ChogyDan	I'm trying to find out why  sudo apt-get remove --purge 2.6.31-14* would remove the kernels 31-10, 31-11, 31-14 and 31-19
2010-09-04T17:42:00.000Z	ChogyDan	kaddi	pastebin?
2010-09-04T17:43:00.000Z	kaddi	ChogyDan	http://pastebin.com/WnFX7zCR
2010-09-04T17:44:00.000Z	ChogyDan	kaddi	yeah, I duuno, maybe try linux*02.6.31-14*
2010-09-04T17:45:00.000Z	kaddi	ChogyDan	I want it to only remove 14, not 10,11 and 19 as well... This nearly killed my PC, trying to uninstall all present kernels on the system
2010-09-04T17:46:00.000Z	kaddi	ChogyDan	you're suggestion linux*02.6.31-14* says no package found
2010-09-04T17:47:00.000Z	ChogyDan	kaddi	yeah, the 0 was a typo
2010-09-04T17:48:00.000Z	kaddi	ChogyDan	yeah, I tried it without the 0 too and got no hits
2010-09-04T17:50:00.000Z	kaddi	ChogyDan	I just think this is a rather dangerous behaviour, because if I were to uninstall the old 2.6.32-22 kernel, that would automatically also uninstall the 23 and the current 24 as well
2011-02-08T21:32:00.000Z	ChogyDan	kaddi	can you pastebin all the output? including the commands you used to setup the chroot?

2011-02-08T21:39:00.000Z	ChogyDan	kaddi	I don't really know, but maybe you mounted nothing on the proc and sysfs commands?   Maybe try sudo mount --bind /proc /mnt/proc           etc
2011-02-08T21:44:00.000Z	ChogyDan	kaddi	also don't forget to cp your resolv.conf
2011-02-08T21:56:00.000Z	ChogyDan	kaddi	I have had trouble with *s and apt-get.  I say avoid it like the plague because it does go all crazy
2011-02-08T21:57:00.000Z	kaddi	ChogyDan	I will from now on. Believe me.. It just pisses me off that people tell me I lie because they can't grasp the concept
