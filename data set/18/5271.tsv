2008-12-12T04:38:00.000Z	U-b-u-n-t-u		my cpu is using 100% while I watch avi files with totem..... with past versions it never was that high any idea why anyone?
2008-12-12T04:38:00.000Z	gnutron	U-b-u-n-t-u	that usually indicates a memory leak or other problem.
2008-12-12T04:39:00.000Z	U-b-u-n-t-u	gnutron	memory leak?
2008-12-12T04:39:00.000Z	gnutron	U-b-u-n-t-u	poorly written code can easily 'leak' memory.
2008-12-12T04:40:00.000Z	U-b-u-n-t-u	gnutron	but this is a freshly installed version of 8.10
2008-12-12T04:41:00.000Z	gnutron	U-b-u-n-t-u	it should settle down, it must be chewing on something difficult.
2008-12-12T04:41:00.000Z	U-b-u-n-t-u	gnutron	nothing else is running when I try to view the avi file ith totem it goes from 1% cpu to 99%-100%
2008-12-12T04:42:00.000Z	gnutron	U-b-u-n-t-u	could be a codec issue or a corrupted avi
2008-12-12T04:42:00.000Z	U-b-u-n-t-u	gnutron	I thought of that so I tried 4 other avi files and they all ran the cpu up to 100%
2008-12-12T04:43:00.000Z	gnutron	U-b-u-n-t-u	re-install totem might help. not sure.
2008-12-12T04:44:00.000Z	U-b-u-n-t-u	gnutron	I did that too and installed all the plugins and re-installed and I tried another movie player kmplayer etc all the same 100% cpu
2008-12-12T04:44:00.000Z	gnutron	U-b-u-n-t-u	i can't explain that, strange.
2008-12-12T04:45:00.000Z	U-b-u-n-t-u	gnutron	yeah its odd I can put those avi's on my vista machine and it doesnt increase the cpu over about 20% and both boxes have the same cpu
2008-12-12T04:45:00.000Z	gnutron	U-b-u-n-t-u	i would suspect the codecs used to create the file you're viewing.
2008-12-12T04:46:00.000Z	U-b-u-n-t-u	gnutron	and this has only happen with 8.10
2008-12-12T04:47:00.000Z	gnutron	U-b-u-n-t-u	8.10 isn't perfect...
2008-12-12T04:47:00.000Z	U-b-u-n-t-u	gnutron	I think I am going back to 8.04
2008-12-12T04:47:00.000Z	gnutron	U-b-u-n-t-u	your resources are a factor also.
