2009-11-29T05:18:00.000Z	boscop		why doesn't "amixer set Master on" unmute the volume?
2009-11-29T05:18:00.000Z	boscop		it says it's on but it's not
2009-11-29T05:20:00.000Z	kostkon	boscop	try amixer set Master unmute, also amixer set PCM unmute
2009-11-29T05:25:00.000Z	boscop	kostkon	I tried it but "amixer set Master unmute" seems to behave like "on" and the other results in: amixer: Invalid command!
2009-11-29T05:25:00.000Z	kostkon	boscop	try installing alsa-utils then
2009-11-29T05:26:00.000Z	boscop	kostkon	I have alsamixer, alsactl and alsa
2009-11-29T05:26:00.000Z	kostkon	boscop	then use alsamixer
2009-11-29T05:26:00.000Z	kostkon	boscop	insteead of calling amixer. or if oyu want install gnome-alsamixer for a gui
2009-11-29T05:27:00.000Z	boscop	kostkon	No, I want a command that I can run on startup, no GUI, because on startup the volume is 0
2009-11-29T05:27:00.000Z	kostkon	boscop	then install the package alsa-utils to get amixer
2009-11-29T05:27:00.000Z	boscop	kostkon	I have amixer
2009-11-29T05:27:00.000Z	kostkon	boscop	sure?
2009-11-29T05:28:00.000Z	boscop	kostkon	the commands I used were amixer commands
2009-11-29T05:28:00.000Z	boscop	kostkon	scroll back if you don't believe me
2009-11-29T05:28:00.000Z	kostkon	boscop	ok
2009-11-29T05:29:00.000Z	boscop	kostkon	once I unmute it via a gui (the button in the panel) muting and unmuting via amixer works
2009-11-29T05:29:00.000Z	kostkon	boscop	hmm
2009-11-29T05:29:00.000Z	boscop	kostkon	but as soon as I use the gui to mute it, or at startup, it doesn't work
