2012-09-30T14:22:00.000Z	Ramtron		How do I navigate to a file through the terminal? I'm not finding any information on it.
2012-09-30T14:23:00.000Z	jrib	Ramtron	cd DIRECTORY
2012-09-30T14:23:00.000Z	jrib	Ramtron	case is important.  So: cd Desktop
2012-09-30T14:25:00.000Z	jrib	Ramtron	go to Desktop, then go to Android-sdk/tools/android
2012-09-30T14:25:00.000Z	jrib	Ramtron	or you can provide a full path (note ~ expands to your $HOME): cd ~/Desktop/Android-sdk/tools/android
2012-09-30T14:25:00.000Z	jrib	Ramtron	then go to the directory it is in
2012-09-30T14:28:00.000Z	jrib	Ramtron	so did you do that?
2012-09-30T14:29:00.000Z	jrib	Ramtron	what directory are you in now? Type « pwd »
2012-09-30T14:29:00.000Z	jrib	Ramtron	that's not the output of pwd
2012-09-30T14:30:00.000Z	jrib	Ramtron	you're in "desktop" with a lowercase "d"?
2012-09-30T14:31:00.000Z	jrib	Ramtron	great.  You can check that the android-sdk-linux directory is in your current directory (~/Desktop), by listing all of the files first.  Type « ls »
2012-09-30T14:31:00.000Z	jrib	Ramtron	so, now you can "cd" to it.  Do that now
2012-09-30T14:32:00.000Z	jrib	Ramtron	sure
2012-09-30T14:33:00.000Z	jrib	Ramtron	yes, though I think you don't have java installed
2012-09-30T14:35:00.000Z	jrib	Ramtron	well if you really want that version of java, I guess so
2012-09-30T14:35:00.000Z	jrib	Ramtron	you should be able to use the openjdk as far as I know
2012-09-30T14:45:00.000Z	Ramtron	jrib	Finally, Android opens. Thanks for the help.
2012-09-30T14:45:00.000Z	jrib	Ramtron	no problem
