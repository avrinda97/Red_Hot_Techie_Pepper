2005-04-10T15:38:00.000Z	DemisM	kbrooks	how is mandrake easier than ubuntu?
2005-04-10T15:38:00.000Z	kbrooks	DemisM	you havent tried mandrake yet
2005-04-10T15:38:00.000Z	DemisM		I have, it's like red crap
2005-04-10T15:38:00.000Z	kbrooks	DemisM	it's GREAT
2005-04-10T15:38:00.000Z	kbrooks		red crap?
2005-04-10T15:38:00.000Z	kbrooks		u joking?
2005-04-10T15:38:00.000Z	DemisM		heh red hat
2005-04-10T15:39:00.000Z	DemisM		I don't know, I installed ubuntu and I haven't had to configure much
2005-04-10T15:39:00.000Z	DemisM		just use apt-get and look at the how-tos
2005-04-10T15:40:00.000Z	DemisM	kbrooks	 there is soooo much ubuntu support, if people took time to look at the bugs and the wiki you could probably get any question answered
2005-04-10T15:40:00.000Z	kbrooks	DemisM	support does not matter
2005-04-10T15:41:00.000Z	DemisM	kbrooks	and it's easy to use
2005-04-10T15:41:00.000Z	kbrooks		documentation DOES matter
2005-04-10T15:42:00.000Z	DemisM	kbrooks	ubuntu doesn't have documentation?...
2005-04-10T15:42:00.000Z	kbrooks	DemisM	it does! DOCUMENTATION MATTERS
2005-04-10T15:43:00.000Z	DemisM	kbrooks	heh, I'm not trying to argue just wondering what makes mandrake easier to use then ubuntu
2005-04-10T15:43:00.000Z	kbrooks	DemisM	YMMV
