2011-01-01T19:44:00.000Z	IdleOne	kk9822	not all programs are cross platform, it is very possible that application will never work in linux/wine
2011-01-01T19:45:00.000Z	IdleOne	kk9822	no.
2011-01-01T19:45:00.000Z	IdleOne	kk9822	We are accepting that some applications written to be run on Windows will only run on Windows.
2011-01-01T19:46:00.000Z	IdleOne	kk9822	install Windows.
2011-01-01T19:46:00.000Z	IdleOne	kk9822	you can install windows in a Virtual machine.
2011-01-01T19:48:00.000Z	IdleOne	kk9822	in that case you can ask in #winehq if they can help you with that application
2011-01-01T19:50:00.000Z	IdleOne	kk9822	You have 3 options available, Install Windows using VirtualBox, try to get the app running in wine see #winehq or Install Windows and Ubuntu in a dual boot and use windows when you need to.
2011-01-01T19:53:00.000Z	IdleOne	kk9822	the problem is not ubuntu, the problem is the application you wish to run on linux which is not supported by the software vendor. This is not an Ubuntu issue. Please ask in #winehq if they have a solution.
