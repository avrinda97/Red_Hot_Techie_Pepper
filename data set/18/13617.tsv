2012-07-17T23:19:00.000Z	sophie_		my problem is still not solved, can someone else help me?
2012-07-17T23:20:00.000Z	fabian__	sophie_	what is your problem ?
2012-07-17T23:21:00.000Z	sophie_	fabian__	my issue is simple, I can't boot into any OS (I have 2, windows 7 and ubuntu 12.04 desktop 64b). It was working before, and I didn't change anything regarding this. I didn't install a new hdd or anything. The computer was shut down by force. And the file system where / and /home (it's the same partition) might be full.
2012-07-17T23:21:00.000Z	sophie_	fabian__	and I don't even see grub.
2012-07-17T23:22:00.000Z	sophie_	fabian__	I am logged into a live cd and waiting for instructions.
2012-07-17T23:22:00.000Z	fabian__	sophie_	what happens when you boot the computer ?
2012-07-17T23:22:00.000Z	sophie_	fabian__	it says 'no OS found'.
2012-07-17T23:23:00.000Z	sophie_	fabian__	although there's win7 and ubuntu on it.
2012-07-17T23:23:00.000Z	sophie_	fabian__	I don't even see grub
2012-07-17T23:23:00.000Z	fabian__	sophie_	if it's about you loose a system, would you rather loose windows or ubuntu?
2012-07-17T23:24:00.000Z	sophie_	fabian__	haha.
2012-07-17T23:37:00.000Z	fabian__	sophie_	if you have anything really important on those systems go the a store next corner and buy a new HDD, reinstall one of the systems and to to check if this HDD is still working.
2012-07-17T23:38:00.000Z	fabian__	sophie_	maybe your disk burned.
2012-07-17T23:38:00.000Z	sophie_	fabian__	I doubt it.
2012-07-17T23:39:00.000Z	fabian__	sophie_	boot from cd and make a disk test.
2012-07-17T23:39:00.000Z	sophie_	fabian__	I am logged into a live cd. What disk test are you talking about
2012-07-17T23:40:00.000Z	sophie_	fabian__	what do you mean by reboot.?
2012-07-17T23:41:00.000Z	fabian__	sophie_	when the boot shows a small white keyboard hit any   key you gonna see the tests available.
