2009-01-12T16:46:00.000Z	ikonia	augustowebd	looking at the docs, auth_digest is built into apackage
2009-01-12T16:46:00.000Z	ikonia	augustowebd	as in, it's already installed, I'm looking to confirm that now

2009-01-12T16:47:00.000Z	ikonia	augustowebd	you don't konw what document I'm reading, so you can't say you've read it
2009-01-12T16:48:00.000Z	ikonia	augustowebd	the ubuntu documentation seems to suggest auth_digest is already installed/built into apache already, so I'm looking to confirm that

2009-01-12T16:57:00.000Z	ikonia	augustowebd	and where did you get the apache install ?
