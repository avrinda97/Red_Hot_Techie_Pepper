2006-01-13T12:02:00.000Z	psusi		if you install apache, it's because you WANT port 80 open
2006-01-13T12:03:00.000Z	psusi		you shoot yourself in the foot because you're stupid, it is your own fault...
2006-01-13T12:04:00.000Z	psusi		you chose to open the port... if you chose to open the port, you'd also choose to disable the firewall if it was on by default... ubuntu provides automatic security updates easily enough
2006-01-13T12:04:00.000Z	iKernel	psusi	Being stupid isn't one's fault.
2006-01-13T12:05:00.000Z	psusi	iKernel	that's my point
2006-01-13T12:05:00.000Z	psusi	iKernel	ohh... you said it isn't?  what are you on crack?
2006-01-13T12:06:00.000Z	iKernel	psusi	Nope.
2006-01-13T12:06:00.000Z	iKernel	psusi	Being stupid is the result of not paying attention in classes. Not paying attention in classes is the result of friends annoying you.
2006-01-13T12:07:00.000Z	psusi	iKernel	no... being uninformed is the result of not paying attention in class... being stupid is not caring enough to bother paying attention in class
2006-01-13T12:07:00.000Z	iKernel	psusi	hmm k
2006-01-13T12:08:00.000Z	iKernel	psusi	Let's inject people with medicene that makes them permantly care.
2006-01-13T12:08:00.000Z	psusi	iKernel	why bother? they are entitled to be stupid... I'm busy doing other things and if we did that, who would take out the trash? ;)
2006-01-13T12:10:00.000Z	iKernel	psusi	k
2006-01-13T12:11:00.000Z	psusi	iKernel	I just saw on the news tonight that the gov't has decided to force banks to charge higher minimum monthly payments on credit cards because too many people are stupid and only make the minimum payments, which results in them paying huge interest over 40 years
2006-01-14T07:54:00.000Z	iKernel	psusi	Don't use shutdown, reboot is easier.
2006-01-14T07:56:00.000Z	iKernel	psusi	I said that.
2006-01-14T07:56:00.000Z	iKernel	psusi	No need for sudo for anything if you're logged on as root.
2006-01-14T07:56:00.000Z	psusi	iKernel	ohh, thought you meant no need for sudo with the reboot command ;)
