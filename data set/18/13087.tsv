2007-09-04T13:20:00.000Z	vlt		Hello. When I copy files from/to a pmounted usb media I get no progres information. The file seems to be written immediately and I never know when it's finished and if I can pumount it. Any idea what could be the problem here?
2007-09-04T13:21:00.000Z	MenZa	vlt	I think pmount uses async, which means it just tells the computer to write to the drive later
2007-09-04T13:21:00.000Z	MenZa	vlt	which I personally think is stupid.
2007-09-04T13:21:00.000Z	MenZa	vlt	Try umounting it
2007-09-04T13:23:00.000Z	vlt	MenZa	I tried it several times. It finally works when rw access is over but I always have to wait and try (and try again) ...
2007-09-04T13:24:00.000Z	MenZa	vlt	I suggest you create an fstab entry for it
2007-09-04T13:39:00.000Z	vlt	MenZa	What is the advantage of creating an fstab entry for the usb device? This is the current line from mtab: "/dev/sdb1 /media/PHONE vfat rw,noexec,nosuid,nodev,noatime,uid=1000,utf8,shortname=lower 0 0". Anything here to improve with a separate entry?
2007-09-04T13:40:00.000Z	MenZa	vlt	mtab just shows what partitions are mounted
2007-09-04T13:41:00.000Z	vlt	MenZa	I'll try, thanks.
2007-09-04T13:41:00.000Z	MenZa	vlt	np :)
2007-09-04T13:41:00.000Z	MenZa	vlt	you can add "auto", too
2007-09-04T13:42:00.000Z	MenZa	vlt	afterwards, to mount it, do mount /media/PHONE
2007-09-04T13:49:00.000Z	vlt	MenZa	Adding "sync" to the pmount options also solved the problem. Thank you.
2007-09-04T13:49:00.000Z	MenZa	vlt	Not at all. :)
2007-09-04T13:49:00.000Z	MenZa	vlt	I find the async used is incredibly annoying for media you remove a lot
2007-09-04T13:49:00.000Z	MenZa	vlt	breaks everything
2007-09-04T13:52:00.000Z	vlt	MenZa	Yes, and 2m39.332s for a 6.5MB file sounds a little more realistic :/
2008-12-29T16:53:00.000Z	MenZa	vlt	ext3 is good.
