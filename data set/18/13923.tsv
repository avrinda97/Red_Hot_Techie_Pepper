2005-10-03T16:08:00.000Z	ccooke	thread	lost how?
2005-10-03T16:09:00.000Z	ccooke	thread	but it still works as a trackpad?
2005-10-03T16:09:00.000Z	thread	ccooke	yeah.. it works...
2005-10-03T16:10:00.000Z	ccooke	thread	tried installing tpconfig?
2005-10-03T16:10:00.000Z	ccooke	thread	it may give you some help
2005-10-03T16:11:00.000Z	thread	ccooke	it says it can't open my ps2 port (/dev/psaux) ... what does that mean?
2005-10-03T16:11:00.000Z	thread	ccooke	the file exists...
2005-10-03T16:11:00.000Z	ccooke	thread	run it under sudo
2005-10-03T16:11:00.000Z	thread	ccooke	ah... it says Found Synaptics Touchpad\nFirmware: 8.96 (multiple-byte mode).
2005-10-03T16:13:00.000Z	thread	ccooke	tpconfig -i tells me all the good stuff... looks perfect. why isn't x failing to recognize my synaptics touchpad?
2005-10-03T16:13:00.000Z	ccooke	thread	hmm
2005-10-03T16:13:00.000Z	ccooke	thread	I'm not sure.
2005-10-03T16:14:00.000Z	ccooke	thread	I have a similar touchpad, also not working - although I didn't configure it in hoary.
2005-10-03T16:14:00.000Z	ccooke	thread	I'll see if I can get it working, and let you know
2005-10-03T16:14:00.000Z	thread	ccooke	cool... I'm just out of ideas here... seems like it should be working at this point
2005-10-03T16:14:00.000Z	ccooke	thread	oh, one thing - try 'grep -i synapt /var/log/Xorg.0.log'
2005-10-03T16:35:00.000Z	ccooke	thread	Okay. I've verified that the synaptics driver is *loaded* on mine.
