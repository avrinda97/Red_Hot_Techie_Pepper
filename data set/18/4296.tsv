2010-01-06T00:02:00.000Z	nixfreak		if ssh port is open shouldn't it be in the hosts file ?
2010-01-06T00:03:00.000Z	nixfreak		what wrong person
2010-01-06T00:03:00.000Z	nixfreak		I asked about ssh port should show in hosts file
2010-01-06T00:03:00.000Z	jrib	nixfreak	why?
2010-01-06T00:04:00.000Z	jrib	nixfreak	no...
2010-01-06T00:04:00.000Z	jrib	nixfreak	what are you trying to accomplish?
2010-01-06T00:05:00.000Z	jrib	nixfreak	what file?
2010-01-06T00:05:00.000Z	jrib	nixfreak	it's not
2012-08-23T01:30:00.000Z	jrib	nixfreak	undo what you did :/
2012-08-23T01:29:00.000Z	jrib	nixfreak	you've probably used some bad (read: not meant for you distribution) repositories or installed some unofficial packages
2012-10-15T19:08:00.000Z	jrib	nixfreak	/etc/profile* is more appropriate imo
2012-10-15T19:09:00.000Z	nixfreak	jrib	-> /etc/profile for each user or is that system wide
2012-10-15T19:09:00.000Z	jrib	nixfreak	/etc/profile is system-wide
2012-10-15T19:09:00.000Z	jrib	nixfreak	you can also just drop it in /etc/profile.d/ if you want to keep things tidy
2012-10-15T19:10:00.000Z	jrib	nixfreak	there's also /etc/environment
2012-10-15T19:11:00.000Z	jrib	nixfreak	sure
2012-10-15T19:12:00.000Z	jrib	nixfreak	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EnvironmentVariables suggests using /etc/environment instead of /etc/profile .  I'm not sure why :/
2012-10-15T19:12:00.000Z	nixfreak	jrib	- used to archlinux and debian - so many places you can put a PATH in ubuntu
