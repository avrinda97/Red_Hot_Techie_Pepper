2008-01-07T01:26:00.000Z	htmljunkie		so i'm here to learn
2008-01-07T01:26:00.000Z	harm	htmljunkie	apache, vsftp = serverbox more or less
2008-01-07T01:31:00.000Z	harm	htmljunkie	what do u want to make a Webserver? get apache.. an FTP server can be made in under a minute..
2008-01-07T01:31:00.000Z	harm	htmljunkie	sudo apt-get install vsftp then u can login on your server with your linux loginname and password
2008-01-07T01:32:00.000Z	harm	htmljunkie	if u want to access ur server from outside your network (house) u will need to forward port 21 (www.portforward.com)
2008-01-07T01:35:00.000Z	harm	htmljunkie	depends.. first time yes.. after a couple of tries it can be done but it is a bit advanced
2008-01-07T01:36:00.000Z	harm	htmljunkie	but basically you have to change /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/default and perhaps two other files.. u can definatly find some awsome tutorials online
2008-01-07T01:36:00.000Z	harm	htmljunkie	one tutorial which helped me was Perfect ubuntu webserver setup
2008-01-07T01:40:00.000Z	htmljunkie	harm	do you have a link to that tutorial?
