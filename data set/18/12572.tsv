2006-11-24T13:13:00.000Z	anton_		hi everybody :)
2006-11-24T13:14:00.000Z	anton_		doesn't sound good, ernz
2006-11-24T13:14:00.000Z	Ernz	anton_	Suggestions?
2006-11-24T13:16:00.000Z	Ernz	anton_	Ideally I would boot into ubuntu 1st because I need to write a CD of stuff currently on the 20GB HDD.
2006-11-24T13:17:00.000Z	Ernz	anton_	plan B? :S
2006-11-24T13:18:00.000Z	Ernz	anton_	I think it may be an Ubuntu issue :( I am trying a "Mandriva" liveCD that I just HAPPEN to have and it seems to be booting A-OK.
2006-11-24T13:20:00.000Z	Ernz	anton_	are you using an older machine?
2006-11-24T13:21:00.000Z	Ernz	anton_	As luck has it, I have a PIII kicking around somewhere ;)
2006-11-24T13:23:00.000Z	Ernz	anton_	So it is...
2006-11-24T13:24:00.000Z	Ernz	anton_	Whats the command to mount NTFS hda1?
2006-11-24T13:26:00.000Z	Ernz	anton_	Only KB working at the mo everything is being done from terminal
2006-11-24T13:28:00.000Z	Ernz	anton_	lol - Drive is empty.
2006-11-24T13:30:00.000Z	Ernz	anton_	Dunno, I just rebooted. I am going to load fail safes on the Mobo and try again. I ahve suspicions that that may be it.
2006-11-24T13:30:00.000Z	Ernz	anton_	Nearly, yes.
2006-11-24T13:48:00.000Z	Ernz	anton_	Fixed our what my problem was with that boot screen...
2006-11-24T13:50:00.000Z	Ernz	anton_	Correction: "Figured". lol - No, bizzarrely enough the USB keyboard works in the BIOS, works with a Mandriva boot, but not with Ubuntu. Very odd. I noticed it when I got a "Disk Read Error" and the thing wouldn't retry when I hit the Any key...
2006-11-24T13:51:00.000Z	Ernz	anton_	I just degaussed this 21" Compaq MONSTER by accident! Scared the hell out of me!
2006-11-24T13:53:00.000Z	Ernz	anton_	Thanks for your help there. I think I manage from here.
