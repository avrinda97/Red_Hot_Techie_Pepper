2008-06-05T01:15:00.000Z	mDemocritus		is there any kernels recommended for hardy besides 2.6.24-14 and -16?
2008-06-05T01:16:00.000Z	amrik	mDemocritus	there is -18 available as an update now
2008-06-05T01:17:00.000Z	mDemocritus	amrik	hmm i hope it fixed the hdd detection issue
2008-06-05T01:17:00.000Z	amrik	mDemocritus	what issue is that?
2008-06-05T01:18:00.000Z	mDemocritus	amrik	hurg... lemmie find the bug report for ya
2008-06-05T01:18:00.000Z	mDemocritus	amrik	rats can't log in anymore, that machine's ip must have changed
2008-06-05T01:19:00.000Z	amrik	mDemocritus	you don't have a static ip for it?
2008-06-05T01:19:00.000Z	mDemocritus	amrik	it would fail to assign the drive to /dev/sdb1, 2, etc
2008-06-05T01:19:00.000Z	mDemocritus	amrik	nah it's my buddy's, he's got a cable isp
2008-06-05T01:20:00.000Z	mDemocritus	amrik	i found a couple bugs filed for it, cross distro, affecting red hat and ubuntu, so it looks like an upstream issue
2008-06-05T01:22:00.000Z	mDemocritus	amrik	the dmesg output is similar to this comment on that bug https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/file-roller/+bug/222322/comments/10
2008-06-05T01:24:00.000Z	amrik	mDemocritus	is there any reason to believe that something bad happened to the disk?
2008-06-05T01:25:00.000Z	mDemocritus	amrik	nope... works fine with the 2.6.22-17 kernel from gutsy
2008-06-05T01:25:00.000Z	mDemocritus	amrik	but X doesn't work with that kernel D:
2008-06-05T01:25:00.000Z	amrik	mDemocritus	aw man what the hell that sucks. whats the error with X?
2008-06-05T01:27:00.000Z	mDemocritus	amrik	it's the normal "no screens found". i could probably fix it, but i hate messing with xorg.conf when it's not my machine...
2008-06-05T01:28:00.000Z	amrik	mDemocritus	also its not easy to remotely debug xserver problems. did you try the latest vanilla kernel? (2.6.25.4)
2008-06-05T01:30:00.000Z	mDemocritus	amrik	indeed it isn't. the latest vanilla kernel supposedly fixes it, based on the comments on that bug, but again, since it's not my system, i'd prefer to keep it simple
