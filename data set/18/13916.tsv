2007-12-02T20:48:00.000Z	notonekind		Hey I need to recover a bunch of files that turned into one index.dat file. can anyone help me?
2007-12-02T20:49:00.000Z	notonekind		Can anyone help me figure out how to extrack files that turned into a .dat file????
2007-12-02T20:49:00.000Z	soundray	notonekind	turned into a .dat file?
2007-12-02T20:50:00.000Z	soundray	notonekind	how did that happen?
2007-12-02T20:53:00.000Z	soundray	notonekind	can you not just do the same again? Copy the unreadable-for-XP files with Ubuntu?
2007-12-02T20:55:00.000Z	soundray	notonekind	from there, did you copy the data to a different location on the same disk?
2007-12-02T20:56:00.000Z	soundray	notonekind	I think you should try copying the inaccessible data to a different filesystem, like a USB stick.
2007-12-02T20:56:00.000Z	soundray	notonekind	it's probably safe to say that you can't trust your Windows partition to hold data any more.
2007-12-02T20:56:00.000Z	soundray	notonekind	about 15 DVDs :)
2007-12-02T20:58:00.000Z	soundray	notonekind	no, forget the index file. Get at the source files with Ubuntu again.
2007-12-02T20:59:00.000Z	soundray	notonekind	have you got 90GB free on your Ubuntu partition(s)?
2007-12-02T20:59:00.000Z	soundray	notonekind	ah
2007-12-02T21:00:00.000Z	soundray	notonekind	if you value that data at all, I would turn the computer off now, find a separate hard disk with 90GB free, and copy everything over to that one using the live CD.
2007-12-02T21:01:00.000Z	soundray	notonekind	that's not what you said earlier...
2007-12-02T21:02:00.000Z	soundray	notonekind	forget that.
2007-12-02T21:03:00.000Z	soundray	notonekind	plenty of people here for me to support who don't run off to do something else.
2007-12-02T21:20:00.000Z	soundray	notonekind	your problem is a Windows one. Ask in an appropriate channel.
2007-12-02T21:22:00.000Z	soundray	notonekind	Windows clumped your files together into a single one. How is that not a Windows problem?
