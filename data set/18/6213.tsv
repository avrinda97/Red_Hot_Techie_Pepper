2008-06-09T07:45:00.000Z	BoltClock		hi, ï»¿i have ubuntu hardy and windows xp installed in two separate disks. is there a way i can get my windows disk to automatically mount when i start ubuntu? i access it almost all the time for my windows files
2008-06-09T07:46:00.000Z	anirudh0_	BoltClock	you need to add an entry in /etc/fstab
2008-06-09T07:52:00.000Z	BoltClock	anirudh0_	some help here being a linux newbie.. i tried reading the guides that i found by googling but im still not sure how to modify /etc/fstab for my purpose
2008-06-09T07:52:00.000Z	anirudh0_	BoltClock	open up fstab...see the format used there..if you still have questions then come back
2008-06-09T07:54:00.000Z	BoltClock	anirudh0_	after the path to the other drives (cd, floppy) i see a list of arguments but dont really understand them
2008-06-09T07:54:00.000Z	anirudh0_	BoltClock	just add "defaults 0 0"
2008-06-09T07:54:00.000Z	BoltClock	anirudh0_	huh?
2008-06-09T07:54:00.000Z	anirudh0_	BoltClock	"defaults" is generally good enough...and use ntfs-3g as the driver, if the win partition is ntfs
2008-06-09T07:55:00.000Z	anirudh0_	BoltClock	one sec..post your fstab..i'll edit it and post again
2008-06-09T07:56:00.000Z	BoltClock	anirudh0_	http://paste.ubuntu.com/18639
2008-06-09T07:58:00.000Z	anirudh0_	BoltClock	http://paste.ubuntu.com/18640/
2008-06-09T07:59:00.000Z	BoltClock	anirudh0_	got it, i'll take it from there
2008-06-09T07:59:00.000Z	anirudh0_	BoltClock	i assume your win partiton is ntfs
2008-06-09T07:59:00.000Z	BoltClock	anirudh0_	before i edit, do i have to umount it first?
2008-06-09T08:00:00.000Z	anirudh0_	BoltClock	nope..you have to reload the file with sudo mount -a..before that you must unmount..if mount point is same that is
2008-06-09T08:00:00.000Z	BoltClock	anirudh0_	ok
2008-06-09T08:02:00.000Z	BoltClock	anirudh0_	now i cant mount my disk
2008-06-09T08:02:00.000Z	BoltClock	anirudh0_	at least not with the GUI
