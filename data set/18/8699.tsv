2007-07-09T13:48:00.000Z	ubunben		has anyone here successfully installed vmware-server via apt-get in feisty fawn?
2007-07-09T13:50:00.000Z	ubunben		when did this kernel panic occur?
2007-07-09T13:50:00.000Z	iarwain	ubunben	i must say that i'm trying to boot a live-cd from my ram. following this guide https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BootToRAM
2007-07-09T13:51:00.000Z	iarwain	ubunben	the error that bothers me is the "init 147: can't open /scripts/iarwain/boot_to_ram/casper" because i have my folder in ~/boot_to_ram instead of /
2007-07-09T13:52:00.000Z	ubunben	iarwain	hmm that is a strange error
2007-07-09T13:53:00.000Z	iarwain	ubunben	i think it can also be my grub entry, care to take a look? :)
2007-07-09T13:53:00.000Z	ubunben	iarwain	how did you set grub up?
2007-07-09T13:55:00.000Z	iarwain	ubunben	this is my complete Grub menu.lst http://pastebin.ca/610098
2007-07-09T13:58:00.000Z	ubunben	iarwain	that is one ugly grub boot file ... i have never played with booting from RAM, but the rest looks OK, is the ram bit where it fails?
2007-07-09T13:58:00.000Z	iarwain	ubunben	=(
2007-07-09T13:58:00.000Z	iarwain	ubunben	the RAM is the failing part, yes
2007-07-09T14:00:00.000Z	ubunben	iarwain	just wondering if you need another / before iarwain => boot=iarwain/boot_to_ram/casper splash
2007-07-09T14:01:00.000Z	iarwain	ubunben	i don't think so, because in the guide there wasn't one aswell. Also, init states it can't open /scripts/iarwain/... so it adds an / automatically
2007-07-09T14:02:00.000Z	ubunben	iarwain	k, been to ubuntu forums?
2007-07-09T14:02:00.000Z	iarwain	ubunben	i have, also started a thread
2007-07-09T14:17:00.000Z	iarwain	ubunben	could it be that the boot= option is somehow messed up? i can't find anything in the Grub manual, but shouldn't i somewhere put a /dev/something in front of it?
2007-07-09T14:18:00.000Z	ubunben	iarwain	no idea with boot_from_ram ...
2007-07-09T14:18:00.000Z	iarwain	ubunben	it's just the path to the casper dir
