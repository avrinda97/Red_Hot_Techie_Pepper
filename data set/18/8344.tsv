2007-09-16T05:13:00.000Z	mindrape	dn4	- wine.  :)
2007-09-16T05:13:00.000Z	dn4	mindrape	that is a good idea, is there a way to install IE though?
2007-09-16T05:14:00.000Z	mindrape	dn4	- yes... you can get ie6 installer from MSs site and then install it via wine.
2007-09-16T05:20:00.000Z	dn4	mindrape	I notied the apt-get sources.list for the link you sent me has edgy and I am running fiesty
2007-09-16T05:41:00.000Z	dn4	mindrape	thank you, I can now do my mathxl homework in ubuntu with out having to install windows
2007-09-17T10:48:00.000Z	mindrape	dn4	- depends... in some cases it might go to /home/username/trash or /.trash
2007-09-17T10:49:00.000Z	mindrape	dn4	- sure... :)
2007-09-17T10:49:00.000Z	mindrape	dn4	- cleaning up your porn?
2007-09-17T10:50:00.000Z	dn4	mindrape	nooo not my porn!
2007-09-17T10:57:00.000Z	mindrape	dn4	- not really... charge users a fee to play each month.  Or spam them with advertisements within the game and as they login...
2007-09-17T10:58:00.000Z	dn4	mindrape	ahh, seems like an unstable business method
2007-09-17T10:59:00.000Z	mindrape	dn4	- you can change the tilesets/theme within your server settings and spam advertisements for companies... that might cover hosting costs.  I don't know about "making money"
2007-09-17T11:00:00.000Z	dn4	mindrape	maybe opening up a server farm will do the trick
2007-09-17T11:00:00.000Z	mindrape	dn4	- probably not but good luck to you.
2007-09-17T11:00:00.000Z	dn4	mindrape	yeah i'm just a poor college student haha
2007-09-17T11:01:00.000Z	mindrape	dn4	- most people dont like to pay to play.  Paying $50 a year for XBox live is a stretch for most.
2007-09-17T11:01:00.000Z	dn4	mindrape	I hear you on that, paying to play blowz
