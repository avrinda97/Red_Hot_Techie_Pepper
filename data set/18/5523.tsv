2008-10-06T15:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	drowner29_	if you uninstall amarok then run sudo apt-get sutoremove
2008-10-06T15:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	drowner29_	then all orphaned apps will go
2008-10-06T15:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	drowner29_	good eyes :D
2008-10-06T15:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	drowner29_	just read the screen. it will tell you what its removing
2008-10-06T15:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	drowner29_	is it removing anything you wanna keep
2008-10-06T15:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	drowner29_	you can always reinstall
2008-10-06T15:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	drowner29_	do you have an AMD graphics card?
