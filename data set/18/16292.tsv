2004-10-14T15:13:00.000Z	staticactivity		how can i install my windows true type fonts
2004-10-14T15:14:00.000Z	pyramid	staticactivity	well i use freetype so as not to interfere with MS patents
2004-10-14T15:14:00.000Z	staticactivity	pyramid	i think it is ok to copy fonts from a licensed copy on my system
2004-10-14T15:15:00.000Z	pyramid	staticactivity	well i don't know...i am not MS...but i think MS has the no reuse eula's and stuff
2004-10-14T15:16:00.000Z	staticactivity	pyramid	oh ok
2004-10-14T15:16:00.000Z	pyramid	staticactivity	i have heard that all those people who only get an oem copy of windows instead of a full retail copy are not allowed to transfer MS at all.
2004-10-14T15:16:00.000Z	pyramid	staticactivity	so when their machine breaks they are out of luck
2004-10-14T15:17:00.000Z	staticactivity	pyramid	i've got a copy from my school
2004-10-14T15:17:00.000Z	pyramid	staticactivity	ok did your school get oem copies or lVM copies or full retail copies
2004-10-14T15:17:00.000Z	pyramid	staticactivity	this is very important as to rights of use
2004-10-14T15:17:00.000Z	staticactivity	pyramid	i don't know :(
2004-10-14T15:18:00.000Z	pyramid	staticactivity	well you better ask
2004-10-14T15:18:00.000Z	staticactivity	pyramid	ok, thanks
2004-10-14T15:19:00.000Z	pyramid	staticactivity	and the judges here in the US have upheld all Eula restrictions...although the EFF is appealing
2004-10-14T15:19:00.000Z	pyramid	staticactivity	but even if the EFF is successful..that will take a long time so for now Eula's are binding...and you must read them carefully
2004-10-14T15:20:00.000Z	staticactivity	pyramid	i don't understand why MS is so restrictive about the crap they make
2004-10-14T15:20:00.000Z	pyramid	staticactivity	well becasue MS is a corporation with greedy stockholders who want lots and lots of money every year
2004-10-14T15:20:00.000Z	staticactivity	pyramid	yeah thats so true
