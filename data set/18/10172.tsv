2007-01-04T06:24:00.000Z	becky_		Does anyone know how to execute a .jar file from the terminal?
2007-01-04T06:24:00.000Z	hyperb0lix	becky_	I'm sure the java program can do that
2007-01-04T06:25:00.000Z	becky_	hyperb0lix	I did 'java -jar thejar.jar' and it returned that error ^^^
2007-01-04T06:25:00.000Z	hyperb0lix	becky_	Ooh, error... what was the msg?
2007-01-04T06:26:00.000Z	becky_	hyperb0lix	"Failed to load Main-Class manifest attribute from theJarfile.jar"
2007-01-04T06:26:00.000Z	becky_	hyperb0lix	It's not the jar file either, it happens with all of them, from multiple sources.
2007-01-04T06:26:00.000Z	hyperb0lix	becky_	Hmm, not sure - I'll google what I can
2007-01-04T06:26:00.000Z	becky_	hyperb0lix	Thanks
2007-01-04T06:27:00.000Z	hyperb0lix	becky_	You're using the java that's installed...?
2007-01-04T06:27:00.000Z	hyperb0lix	becky_	It's the java-common package, if I can recall correctly
2007-01-04T06:27:00.000Z	becky_	hyperb0lix	yep.
2007-01-04T06:27:00.000Z	hyperb0lix	becky_	I just install the JDK from Sun's site
2007-01-04T06:28:00.000Z	becky_	hyperb0lix	I'll give that a go. Hand about.
2007-01-04T06:28:00.000Z	becky_		hang*
2007-01-04T06:31:00.000Z	becky_		hyperb0lix/sleepy009: installing JDK fixed it, I now ever have an option when right clicking the file to run in java runtime environment, thanks all for help - Becky out.
