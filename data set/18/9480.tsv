2007-05-21T11:31:00.000Z	opapo		can you boot Ubuntu from a floppy?
2007-05-21T11:32:00.000Z	opapo		If I only have a floppy drive can I some how boot from a floppy then tell it to go to a cd?
2007-05-21T11:32:00.000Z	danny3793	opapo	why not just tell your boot order to boot from CD first?
2007-05-21T11:33:00.000Z	opapo	danny3793	I don't have the option to boot from cd in bios
2007-05-21T11:34:00.000Z	danny3793	opapo	what options do you have in your boot order
2007-05-21T11:35:00.000Z	opapo	danny3793	floppy1, floppy2, pcmcia, network, harddrive
2007-05-21T11:35:00.000Z	danny3793	opapo	do you have 2 floppy drives?
2007-05-21T11:37:00.000Z	danny3793	opapo	your bios "may" be reading your CD drive as a floppy (not sure on that) try telling it to boot from either floppy 1 or 2, and see if either one of them works with the CD drive
2007-05-21T11:37:00.000Z	opapo	danny3793	I tried it and it didn't work
2007-05-21T11:38:00.000Z	danny3793	opapo	hmm, thats weird, did you install this CD drive after you made/bought this computer?
2007-05-21T11:39:00.000Z	opapo	danny3793	this computer is 10+ years old and I got it because the previous owners didn't want it
2007-05-21T11:39:00.000Z	danny3793	opapo	ouch, no wonder it isnt in BIOS :P, you may not be able to get the BIOS to read the CD Drive, im not sure booting a floppy to tell it to run the CD will work though..
2007-05-21T11:41:00.000Z	opapo	danny3793	how complicated is it to boot from the network if there is no server currently setup for this?
2007-05-21T11:42:00.000Z	danny3793	opapo	im not sure what you mean
2007-05-21T11:42:00.000Z	opapo	danny3793	I have the option in bios to boot from the network
2007-05-21T11:43:00.000Z	danny3793	opapo	hmmm, im not sure what that means, i dont think booting from a network would do anything, perhaps the people that gave you this computer used it as a server? o.o
2007-05-21T11:46:00.000Z	opapo	danny3793	thanks
2007-05-21T11:46:00.000Z	danny3793	opapo	i tried :P, but i think trying to get stuff to work on that comp will be just too hard, as its just a wee bit outdated :P
