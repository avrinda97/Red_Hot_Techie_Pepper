2007-10-02T10:09:00.000Z	murlidhar		err how do i make deluge the default torrent client??
2007-10-02T10:09:00.000Z	Evanlec	murlidhar	good question!
2007-10-02T10:11:00.000Z	murlidhar	Evanlec	thnks but how do i make it default?
2007-10-02T10:11:00.000Z	Evanlec	murlidhar	i dont know lol
2007-10-10T08:12:00.000Z	Evanlec	murlidhar	you could also make one yourself, but thats beyond the scope of support for this channel i believe
2007-10-10T08:12:00.000Z	murlidhar	Evanlec	i am a noob
2007-10-10T08:12:00.000Z	Evanlec	murlidhar	have you tried Deluge?
2007-10-10T08:13:00.000Z	murlidhar	Evanlec	yes i have
2007-10-10T08:13:00.000Z	Evanlec	murlidhar	whats not to like? ;p
2007-10-10T08:14:00.000Z	murlidhar	Evanlec	but i felt linkage was working better plus it is light weight
2007-10-10T08:14:00.000Z	Evanlec	murlidhar	you may be right, but to compile it and install from source probably wouldnt be worth your effort, but look and see if it already has a package for ubuntu
2007-10-10T08:16:00.000Z	murlidhar	Evanlec	there has been no package built for ubuntu http://code.google.com/p/linkage/
2007-10-10T08:17:00.000Z	murlidhar	Evanlec	i tried to compile it but failed miserably
2007-10-10T08:17:00.000Z	Evanlec	murlidhar	if you're relatively new to this stuff...i would say dont bother
2007-10-10T08:19:00.000Z	murlidhar	Evanlec	i am not that new in compiling from source but this gives me a headache since first u have to compile libtorrent and then compile linkage
2007-10-10T08:19:00.000Z	Evanlec	murlidhar	yea, see you probly know more about it than me ;p
2007-10-10T08:20:00.000Z	murlidhar	Evanlec	don't know about u but i am a noobie
2007-10-10T08:21:00.000Z	Evanlec	murlidhar	i am too with compiling stuff
