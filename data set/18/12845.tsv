2006-04-21T11:50:00.000Z	jlb		help,  I have three HDD's.  hda1--40GB ATA formated with FAT32.  sda--80GB SATA (sda1 and sda2, for linux and windows), and a 120GB SATA (sdb).  I need to mount the 40GB drive to access backup data.  What would be the process of adding that drive?
2006-04-21T11:51:00.000Z	noiesmo	jlb	 mount -t vfat /dev/hda1 /mnt/point
2006-04-21T11:52:00.000Z	jlb	DrBanzai	 What kind of files are you looking to play?
2006-04-21T11:54:00.000Z	jlb	DrBanzai	hold on sending you a link, I had the same problem and this fixed it.

2006-04-21T11:57:00.000Z	jlb		noisemo, the command you came back with said "mount point /mnt /point does not exist'
2006-04-21T11:58:00.000Z	noiesmo	jlb	you can create a directory were ever you want to mount to
2006-04-21T11:58:00.000Z	noiesmo	jlb	for example mkdir /opt/winshare
2006-04-21T11:58:00.000Z	noiesmo	jlb	now mount -t vfat /dev/hda1 /opt/winshare
2006-04-21T11:58:00.000Z	jlb		noisemo: ah, so create a folder in /mnt named 'point' and then run that command?
2006-04-21T11:59:00.000Z	noiesmo	jlb	you can create a directory were ever you want to mount to
2006-04-21T11:59:00.000Z	noiesmo	jlb	thats just example
2006-04-21T11:59:00.000Z	jlb		noisemo, ok, sorry so slow, ex-windows user.
2006-04-21T11:59:00.000Z	noiesmo	jlb	we forgive you
2006-04-21T12:00:00.000Z	jlb		thx
2006-04-21T12:02:00.000Z	noiesmo	jlb	if you want to mount automatically on start up via fstab read this http://pastebin.com/662626
2006-04-21T12:02:00.000Z	jlb		noisemo: it's mounted and accessed in /media/backup, but how do I get it to show up when I go to storage media, do I need to reboot?  I only show the linux and windows partitions mounted.
2006-04-21T12:03:00.000Z	noiesmo	jlb	not sure how to show it in media section of kde but you should be able to create shortcut to it
