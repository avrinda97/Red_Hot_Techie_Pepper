2012-10-25T12:13:00.000Z	brady		im trying to downgrade gcc
2012-10-25T12:14:00.000Z	brady		the version that comes default with arduino or ubuntu, does not properly communicate with arduino mega via the usb serial
2012-10-25T12:14:00.000Z	brady		a number of people on a number of pages have reported downgrading it makes it work
2012-10-25T12:14:00.000Z	brady		but when i uninstall gcc, it removes the arduino ide with it
2012-10-25T12:15:00.000Z	brady		so i need to reinstall that after i install the older version of gcc, however, installing arduino ide, installs the newer version of gcc, rendering the whole process back to the start.
2012-10-25T12:16:00.000Z	brady		yes.. but there is something about the newer gcc's that break the serial communications you program into your arduino sketches, particularly with the arduino mega
2012-10-25T12:16:00.000Z	brady		there are many diffrent pages of people reporting the same problem, and the same fix, downgrading gccc.. however none of them specifically explain the process of downgrading.. just that downgrading works.
2012-10-25T12:17:00.000Z	brady		i dont know what that means, or how it would be done.
2012-10-25T12:19:00.000Z	brady		are there any gui applications for doing this?
2012-10-25T12:20:00.000Z	brady		yes i know. everyone tells me everything is so simple and they forward me onto a page that doesn't lead to anything working. argghh.
2012-10-25T12:21:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	brady	 on the other hand, if you use gcc and arduino, one might expect some technical skills from you
2012-10-25T12:40:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	brady	 tip: there's also #gcc and #arduino -- i'm not famiiar with either one of them, tho
2012-10-25T12:43:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	brady	 did you read my tip? better ask in one of those channels
2012-10-25T12:45:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	brady	 makes sense
2012-10-25T12:50:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	brady	 in a terminal, type lsb_release -sd;gcc --version and post the result here
2012-10-25T12:51:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	brady	 execute the commands, don't describe the result, please
2012-10-25T13:30:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	brady	 that's an i386 package, is your pc 32bit or 64bit ?
