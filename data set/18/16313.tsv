2005-01-07T06:36:00.000Z	housetier		will what are you compiling?
2005-01-07T06:37:00.000Z	housetier		will check out "apt-get build-dep" next time :) it might help a little
2005-01-07T06:38:00.000Z	will	housetier	dont have build-dep
2005-01-07T06:38:00.000Z	housetier		will type "apt-get" and see what says next to "build-dep", between "source" and "dist-upgrade"
2005-01-07T06:39:00.000Z	housetier		it works if there are build-dep informations available for a given package
2005-01-07T06:40:00.000Z	will	housetier	how clever! what is thebuild-dep file in the cvs normally calledthen
2005-01-07T06:41:00.000Z	housetier		will apt-get only works on repositories, it does get the information from a file, but not just any file on your filesystem
2005-01-07T06:42:00.000Z	housetier		will apt-get buid-dep will try to find build-dep information about the given package in its database, then download and configure the packages one would need to actually compile the given package
2005-01-07T06:42:00.000Z	will		ah okay
2005-01-07T06:43:00.000Z	housetier		will and since bmp is in the repository, chances are that its build-dep information is as well
2005-01-07T06:45:00.000Z	will		so once i have compiled a program and installed it, can i simply delete the dir with all the source and build in it?
2005-01-07T06:47:00.000Z	housetier	Bolga	try "sudo cp -R /home/user/coco/* /usr/lib/games/quake2/"
2005-01-07T06:49:00.000Z	housetier		will you can, but its not necessary. besides you might want to update soon, keeping the source tree makes the cvs update simpler and quicker
2005-01-07T06:51:00.000Z	housetier	Bolga	you might have a directory "coco" in /usr/lib/games/quake2 which probably is a leftover from the previous copy attempts. It is my guess you can safely remove this one directory
2005-01-07T06:51:00.000Z	housetier	Bolga	I only play gweled and xpat2
2005-01-07T06:53:00.000Z	housetier	Bolga	the command to delete something is "rm" for remove, rm usually only works on files. however, you can delete a directory and its contents with "rm -r /path/to/the/directory"
2005-01-07T06:53:00.000Z	housetier		to delete an empty directory use "rmdir"
2005-01-07T06:54:00.000Z	will	housetier	where is the best place to put all this source?
