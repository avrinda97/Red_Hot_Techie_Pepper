2009-08-05T17:49:00.000Z	leaf-sheep		How do you view logs on bootup?  I have some [fail] that I would like to read but they scrolled up so darn fast.
2009-08-05T17:50:00.000Z	lstarnes	leaf-sheep	you could try dmesg
2009-08-05T17:50:00.000Z	lstarnes	leaf-sheep	there's also /var/log/syslog and other logs in /var/log
2009-08-05T17:51:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	lstarnes	Dr_Willis: I have two [fail] services but I looked up on "sudo nano /etc/default/boot*" to toggle ON --> YES but apparently it was never fixed so boot logging is not possible since 7.10.  The to-be-logged path is /var/log/boot

2009-08-23T14:02:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	lstarnes	Thanks. <3
2009-08-23T14:02:00.000Z	lstarnes	leaf-sheep	why did you need it?
2009-08-23T14:03:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	lstarnes	I borked my wireless interface trying to bridge so the computer/Xbox360/etc can access Internet directly from the laptop.
2009-09-01T09:46:00.000Z	lstarnes	leaf-sheep	you could make an image of the partition using something like dd
2009-09-01T09:46:00.000Z	lstarnes	leaf-sheep	anything on the disk
2009-09-01T09:48:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	lstarnes	MindVirus1: See, I recently got a netbook -- I would like to duplicate the partition (I haven't started it up yet or anything) yet.  It's charging up.  I suppose I'll have to run disc and command dd to copy? How do I dd to paste?
2009-09-13T12:26:00.000Z	lstarnes	leaf-sheep	anywhere
2009-09-13T12:27:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	lstarnes	jmarsden, Gnea:  Compiling ogmrip from svn.  Also, do I want branches or tags or trunk?
2009-09-13T12:27:00.000Z	lstarnes	leaf-sheep	trunk if you want the most current version
2009-09-13T12:27:00.000Z	lstarnes	leaf-sheep	look under branches or tags for specific releases or branches
2009-11-20T10:28:00.000Z	lstarnes	leaf-sheep	maybe ctrl+A followed by @
2009-11-20T10:29:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	lstarnes	Thanks! That did the trick!
