2006-09-05T09:24:00.000Z	kjm		<Ropechoborra> - it shouldn't be.  I'm running it on a 700 MhZ Duron, watching a DVD and writing code in Gedit.  No speed demon, but it works.
2006-09-05T09:25:00.000Z	kjm		<Ropechoborra> - check $top to see if there is anything that is running that is eating processes that shouldn't be,
2006-09-05T09:25:00.000Z	Ropechoborra	kjm	i'll do it
2006-09-05T09:26:00.000Z	kjm		aSt4ral - yes
2006-09-05T09:26:00.000Z	Ropechoborra	kjm	i got 2 tasks running and 100 sleeping.. is that usual ?
2006-09-05T09:27:00.000Z	kjm		sounds about right.  Look for an entry in the top that says  "xx.xx % idle"
2006-09-05T09:27:00.000Z	kjm		journaled
2006-09-05T09:28:00.000Z	kjm		<Ropechoborra> - look at the "top" output - and tell me what % idle is.
2006-09-05T09:28:00.000Z	Ropechoborra		Cpu(s): 82.7% us,  7.0% sy,  0.3% ni,  0.0% id,  6.6% wa,  3.3% hi,  0.0% si
2006-09-05T09:28:00.000Z	kjm		<Ropechoborra> - 82.7 % user - means that something is using 89 % of the processor . . . is that constant?
2006-09-05T09:29:00.000Z	Ropechoborra	kjm	no... it goes from 30 to that...
2006-09-05T09:29:00.000Z	kjm		<Ropechoborra> - How "slow" is slow ?
2006-09-05T09:29:00.000Z	Ropechoborra	kjm	it is mostly in 37%
2006-09-05T09:30:00.000Z	Ropechoborra	kjm	no to much... but is something usual, for eg. when i open a common window or switch desktops it is a bit slow
2006-09-05T09:31:00.000Z	kjm		<Ropechoborra> - Keep an eye on the system monitor and just see if there is something that looks like it's running out of control....all I can suggest off the top of my head.  Nothing seems out of the ordinary.
2006-09-05T09:32:00.000Z	kjm	vik	- Audacity
2006-09-05T09:33:00.000Z	kjm	vik	- I haven't run across anything better
2006-09-05T09:33:00.000Z	Ropechoborra	kjm	i got some processes that dont know what are they for.. , for eg: the mapping-deamon
