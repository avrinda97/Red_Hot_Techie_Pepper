2009-08-28T11:26:00.000Z	MTeck	Hasbro	saying anything like that in this channel warrants removal

2009-08-28T11:28:00.000Z	MTeck	Hasbro	doing what wrong?
2009-08-28T11:29:00.000Z	MTeck	Hasbro	on LTS that command isn't patched for that - not everyone in here is using ubuntu either
2009-08-28T11:30:00.000Z	MTeck	Hasbro	hu?
2009-08-28T11:31:00.000Z	MTeck	Hasbro	your question doesn't make sense

2009-08-28T11:32:00.000Z	MTeck	Hasbro	if you want to talk about windows - go to ##windows
2009-08-28T11:33:00.000Z	MTeck	Hasbro	no - don't try to clean windows from linux unless you're ready for things to break - just do cleaning from windows itself
2009-08-28T11:34:00.000Z	MTeck	Hasbro	what's your native language?
2009-08-28T11:34:00.000Z	Hasbro	MTeck	english you?
2009-08-28T11:34:00.000Z	MTeck	Hasbro	then you should understand what we're saying - stop trolling this channel
2009-08-28T11:35:00.000Z	MTeck	Hasbro	go to ##windows
