2006-04-15T09:15:00.000Z	jsestri2		i had my mouse working for a long time, and on the last restart it stopped working, can anyone point me in the direction of finding a cause?
2006-04-15T09:16:00.000Z	farous	jsestri2	did you change your xorg.conf file
2006-04-15T09:16:00.000Z	jsestri2	farous	no, not before that restart, later i tried a reconfigure with no effect
2006-04-15T09:18:00.000Z	farous	jsestri2	try cat /var/log/Xorg.0.log|grep mouse might tell you something
2006-04-15T09:19:00.000Z	jsestri2	farous	is that file only in existance when ubuntu is loaded?
2006-04-15T09:19:00.000Z	jsestri2	farous	im in windows right now and i can't see that file on my linux partion
2006-04-15T09:19:00.000Z	farous	jsestri2	it is the log file for the last loading of xorg
2006-04-15T09:20:00.000Z	jsestri2	farous	alright i'll try and get that for you, hold on a sec
2006-04-15T09:20:00.000Z	farous	jsestri2	Xorg.0.log is last log there are others you might look at
2006-04-15T09:21:00.000Z	jsestri2	farous	well i have to restart to get them, anything else i should check?
2006-04-15T09:21:00.000Z	farous	jsestri2	nothing in my mind now
2006-04-15T09:27:00.000Z	jsestri2	farous	would you like to see a pastebin?
2006-04-15T09:29:00.000Z	jsestri2	farous	this is my Xorg.0.log http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/11924
2006-04-15T09:31:00.000Z	farous	jsestri2	it is configured as ps2 mouse is that what you have
2006-04-15T09:31:00.000Z	jsestri2	farous	yes, i dont think the Xorg config is bad, it worked before hand
2006-04-15T09:31:00.000Z	jsestri2	farous	and im positive i have not changed it
2006-04-15T09:32:00.000Z	farous	jsestri2	then i do not think i can help perhaps someone else might be able too. hope you find the problem :)
2006-04-15T09:32:00.000Z	jsestri2	farous	just want to double check ps2 is the normal mouse connection right? as opposed to serial or usb...?
