2008-07-12T13:47:00.000Z	quickscript		?
2008-07-12T13:48:00.000Z	quickscript		<bazhang>built-in on your laptop?
2008-07-12T13:49:00.000Z	quickscript		bazhang> the other computer you are talking about is a laptop, right?
2008-07-12T13:50:00.000Z	quickscript		<bazhang>  do you have injection and fragmentation working  with ipw3945?
2008-07-12T13:51:00.000Z	quickscript		<bazhang>  ok.  to connect to the internet on the laptop which features the intel wifi, do you use iwl3945 or something else?
2008-07-12T13:53:00.000Z	quickscript		<bazhang> iwl3945 is the brand new default driver for the intel chipset but a lot of people are having connectivity issues with this new driver. are you?
2008-07-12T13:54:00.000Z	euz734	quickscript	most of these issues are gone in kernel 2.6.25 (which has a newer version of iwl3945)
2008-07-12T13:55:00.000Z	euz734	quickscript	i didn't say there is a official 2.6.25 for hardy. i compiled 2.6.25 myself.
2008-07-12T13:58:00.000Z	euz734	quickscript	compiling my own kernels is something i have done for years
2008-07-12T13:59:00.000Z	euz734	quickscript	and usually a i keep one kernel config per machine and adapt it to newer kernel versions
2008-07-12T14:02:00.000Z	euz734	quickscript	i know
2008-07-12T14:06:00.000Z	euz734	quickscript	btw, the connectivity problems only happen with certain access points. i also have intel 3945 in my notebook and i had no problems with 2.6.24
2008-07-12T14:09:00.000Z	euz734	quickscript	still i don't know which solution to suggest to the average ubuntu user. maybe there is 2.6.25 in backports?
2008-07-12T14:11:00.000Z	euz734	quickscript	i don't know
2008-07-12T14:13:00.000Z	euz734	quickscript	no public away messages please
2008-07-12T14:13:00.000Z	euz734	quickscript	and no nickchange to indicate away status
