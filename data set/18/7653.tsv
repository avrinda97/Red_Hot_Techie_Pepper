2007-12-04T19:20:00.000Z	JesperHuijgens		Does anyone know how to get my sound working
2007-12-04T19:20:00.000Z	JesperHuijgens		it stopped after i started a game
2007-12-04T19:21:00.000Z	JesperHuijgens		is there realy no one who can help me with my broken sound
2007-12-04T19:22:00.000Z	kjp2	JesperHuijgens	i can try
2007-12-04T20:00:00.000Z	kjp2	JesperHuijgens	use lspci to identify your soundcard
2007-12-04T20:03:00.000Z	kjp2	JesperHuijgens	 yes.
2007-12-04T20:04:00.000Z	kjp2	JesperHuijgens	unload the kernel module and reload it
2007-12-04T20:04:00.000Z	JesperHuijgens	kjp2	yes, but how
2007-12-04T20:04:00.000Z	JesperHuijgens	kjp2	by modprobe?
2007-12-04T20:04:00.000Z	kjp2	JesperHuijgens	rmmod modulename
2007-12-04T20:05:00.000Z	kjp2	JesperHuijgens	the key is you need to know which kernel module to unload
2007-12-04T20:05:00.000Z	JesperHuijgens	kjp2	and the modulename is the name i just gave
2007-12-04T20:05:00.000Z	kjp2	JesperHuijgens	 run lsmod to see the installed modules
2007-12-04T20:05:00.000Z	kjp2	JesperHuijgens	 then use google, to match a kernel module name to the lspci output you have
2007-12-04T20:10:00.000Z	kjp2	JesperHuijgens	because honestly, we can't help you figure out it out unless we have that same card.
2007-12-04T20:11:00.000Z	JesperHuijgens	kjp2	last question then, do you think a re√Ønstall will work?
2007-12-04T20:12:00.000Z	JesperHuijgens	kjp2	of ubuntu
2007-12-04T20:14:00.000Z	kjp2	JesperHuijgens	you don't need to reinstall ubuntu, just spend 10 minutes with google
