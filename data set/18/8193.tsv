2012-06-25T18:26:00.000Z	drag0nius		i've problem installing ubuntu server, it does not detect my hdd
2012-06-25T18:27:00.000Z	drag0nius		it was previously used as RAID
2012-06-25T18:27:00.000Z	Twinkletoes	drag0nius	SCSI or IDE/SATA?
2012-06-25T18:28:00.000Z	Twinkletoes	drag0nius	Is it detected in the computer's BIOS?
2012-06-25T18:28:00.000Z	Twinkletoes	drag0nius	and when are you getting the message?
2012-06-25T18:29:00.000Z	Twinkletoes	drag0nius	Say no
2012-06-25T18:32:00.000Z	Twinkletoes	drag0nius	Did you reply "no" to the question about activating a RAID device?
2012-06-25T18:33:00.000Z	Twinkletoes	drag0nius	are BOTH hard drives currently connected?
2012-06-25T18:34:00.000Z	Twinkletoes	drag0nius	Is theis the only hard drive in this computer?
2012-06-25T18:35:00.000Z	Twinkletoes	drag0nius	Did you hit F6 and turn OFF dmraid?
2012-06-25T18:35:00.000Z	Twinkletoes	drag0nius	I thin kI'm out of ideas, sorry
2012-06-25T18:36:00.000Z	Twinkletoes	drag0nius	Yes, do what sacarlson said ^^^
2012-06-25T18:36:00.000Z	Twinkletoes	drag0nius	you can do that from the live CD or any resuce CD type distro
2012-06-25T18:37:00.000Z	Twinkletoes	drag0nius	dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/<device> bs=512 count =1    should do it
2012-06-25T18:38:00.000Z	Twinkletoes	drag0nius	It's not part of the installation, we just want to make sure your hard disk isn't presenting any raid signatures etc.
2012-06-25T18:38:00.000Z	Twinkletoes	drag0nius	So, from another OS, do the above
2012-06-25T18:39:00.000Z	Twinkletoes	drag0nius	Whatever boot CD you choose, when you're in, type: fdisk -l    and if that doesn't show you your disk device, try:  dmesg|grep -i disk
