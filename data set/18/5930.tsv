2010-03-04T06:44:00.000Z	Merritt		Hope someone has insight: Fresh install of Kubuntu 9.10, no sound at all. In KMix enabled all channels, none are muted and volume turned up. lspci reports Creative Labs CA0106 Soundblaster. Seems to be loaded fine. aplay -l reports the sound device, Configure Desktop > Multimedia > Device > Test gives no sound, no login sound, no app sounds. Pulse audio is not installed (surprisingly was not by default), ran purge pulseaudio to be sure. Ma
2010-03-04T06:44:00.000Z	Merritt		nually added user to group 'audio'. Still nothing. Ideas? Thanks
2010-03-04T06:46:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	Merritt	use asoundconf to set your soundcard
2010-03-04T06:46:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	Merritt	Also, if you have an ATI card, make sure snd_hda_intel isn't loaded
2010-03-04T06:53:00.000Z	Merritt	MilitantPotato	One odd note, when I run aplay -l it repeats the card's entry 4 times.
2010-03-04T06:47:00.000Z	Merritt	MilitantPotato	asoundconf does not seem to exist
2010-03-04T06:48:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	Merritt	you'll need to get the package from jaunty repos, it was removed in karmic
2010-03-04T06:49:00.000Z	Merritt	MilitantPotato	How should I pull in the package from jaunty repo?
2010-03-04T06:51:00.000Z	Merritt	MilitantPotato	Hmm, the sound card is already listed as device 0
2010-03-04T06:52:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	Merritt	in what app?
2010-03-04T06:52:00.000Z	Merritt	MilitantPotato	aplay -l
2010-03-04T06:53:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	Merritt	hmm

2010-03-04T06:55:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	Merritt	I'm stumped, normally the inorrect soundcard is selected or another is in the default spot
2010-03-04T06:56:00.000Z	Merritt	MilitantPotato	I'm stumped too. This is a real headache (customer's machine, if it wasn't bad enough!) Thanks for trying to help though
2010-03-04T06:57:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	Merritt	Have you double checked sliders and mute boxes?
2010-03-04T06:58:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	Merritt	dumb question, I know, but some soundcards require weird settings in alsa-mixer
2010-03-04T06:59:00.000Z	Merritt	MilitantPotato	Quadruple-checked, every channel is shown, unmuted and turned up, except for IEC958, which has no slider at all. *shrug*
