2007-12-10T02:46:00.000Z	filleokus	IndyGunFreak	the linux partion is almoust empty, but the ntfs partion is full, and that's the largest one, so i would say like 90% of the disk
2007-12-10T02:46:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	filleokus	so what are you wanting to do, expand the NTFS partition?
2007-12-10T02:47:00.000Z	filleokus	IndyGunFreak	convert the ntfs partion to ext3 and smash it together with my current linux partion

2007-12-10T02:48:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	filleokus	you're not making any sense.. when you say smash them together, do you want to expand the ntfs and decrease ext3, or expand ext3, and decrease ntfs?
2007-12-10T02:49:00.000Z	filleokus	IndyGunFreak	Hmm. I want ONE whole partion all over the disk and i want this whole partion to be ext3.
2007-12-10T02:49:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	filleokus	ok, that makes more sense, are you wanting to do away w/ windows?
2007-12-10T02:50:00.000Z	filleokus	IndyGunFreak	yep, when i first installed my htpc/server i reserved like 20 gig for a future linux install and used the rest to windows and storage.
2007-12-10T02:51:00.000Z	filleokus	IndyGunFreak	but now i have switched over to ubuntu and want to get a whole linux partion.
2007-12-10T02:51:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	filleokus	i see.., well, the *easiest* thing to do, would be to back up important files, and do a clean install of Ubuntu... and just tell it to takeover the whole drive.
2007-12-10T02:52:00.000Z	filleokus	IndyGunFreak	perhaps i need to bring a external hdd and copy my ntfs data on to it, delete the ntfs partion, extend the ext3 and copy the data from the external back on to the big new one.
2007-12-10T02:52:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	filleokus	yeah, you could try that, but i think you'll run into grub issues.
2007-12-10T02:54:00.000Z	filleokus	IndyGunFreak	okey, ll try to o give it a shot later on. do you know by the way if ext3 suports extensions (if it likes to be extended)

2007-12-10T02:54:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	filleokus	not real sure...
2007-12-10T02:54:00.000Z	filleokus	IndyGunFreak	okey, but thank you so much for your time and help :)
2007-12-10T02:55:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak		np, ... it might be easiest to just reinstall.
