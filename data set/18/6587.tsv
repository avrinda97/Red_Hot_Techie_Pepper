2008-04-27T10:01:00.000Z	m1dn1ght		Thank you Cky - this is doing the trick for me!!
2008-04-27T10:02:00.000Z	cky	m1dn1ght	That's neat to know! :-)
2008-04-27T10:22:00.000Z	cky	m1dn1ght	I thought your computer only worked with safe graphics mode.
2008-04-27T10:22:00.000Z	cky	m1dn1ght	In which case, you can't get better resolution without killing your system. :-(
2008-04-27T10:24:00.000Z	cky	m1dn1ght	Okay, that's possible I guess. What video card do you have?
2008-04-27T10:25:00.000Z	cky	m1dn1ght	*nods*
2008-04-27T10:27:00.000Z	cky	m1dn1ght	It might not be supported. The info I have is at http://www.winischhofer.eu/linuxsispart1.shtml#12
2008-04-27T10:27:00.000Z	cky	m1dn1ght	I don't know if that's the most up-to-date info though.
2008-04-27T10:29:00.000Z	cky	m1dn1ght	At least you know you're not the only one with the problem: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=706546
2008-04-27T10:29:00.000Z	cky	m1dn1ght	:-P
2008-04-27T10:30:00.000Z	cky	m1dn1ght	That's a shame. :-(
2008-04-27T10:34:00.000Z	cky	m1dn1ght	*nods*
2008-04-27T10:39:00.000Z	cky	m1dn1ght	I bet you $10 that nickrud's suggestion is change the vesa to sis. :-)
2008-04-27T10:40:00.000Z	cky	m1dn1ght	Because that would be my first suggestion too.
2008-04-27T10:41:00.000Z	cky	m1dn1ght	Did you get a chance to edit your /boot/grub/menu.lst in the end, and add those options to your kopt line?
2008-04-27T10:41:00.000Z	cky	m1dn1ght	Yes, in that file.
2008-04-27T10:41:00.000Z	cky	m1dn1ght	e.g., "kopt=root=... ro noapic"
2008-04-27T10:44:00.000Z	cky	m1dn1ght	I can only hope. :-) Still, glad to be of help.
