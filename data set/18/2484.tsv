2011-10-14T02:27:00.000Z	andeeeuk	lunitik	it asks for a password, it just does not return anything
2011-10-14T02:17:00.000Z	lunitik	andeeeuk	there are always issues right after release though because Ubuntu users don't run the pre-releases much compared to other distros...
2011-10-14T02:22:00.000Z	lunitik	andeeeuk	is there an error when you attempt to use sudo?
2011-10-14T02:23:00.000Z	andeeeuk	lunitik	sudo in command line just does nothing. It just goes to ask for another command
2011-10-14T02:24:00.000Z	lunitik	andeeeuk	you have not set it to NOPASSWD?
2011-10-14T02:24:00.000Z	andeeeuk	lunitik	no, i have changed it a few times to make sure as well
2011-10-14T02:26:00.000Z	lunitik	andeeeuk	I don't believe you, so 'sudo echo "this works" ' please... sudo has been around since the 80's and simply doesn't work as you describe
2011-10-14T02:27:00.000Z	lunitik	andeeeuk	you are wasting our time with your snide comments, we understand you're frustrated, but most here are helping (or trying to) for free... if you want you can pay Canonical for support then cuss them out on the phone, but otherwise please stop being negative in the channel
2011-10-14T02:28:00.000Z	andeeeuk	lunitik	sorry, I just cant beleive what has happened tbh
2011-10-14T02:29:00.000Z	lunitik	andeeeuk	I would prolly recommend a fresh install, cuz I don't understand what has happened either... it seems impossible
2011-10-14T02:29:00.000Z	andeeeuk	lunitik	seems everything that i put in the terminal relating to sudo just gets ignored
2011-10-14T02:30:00.000Z	andeeeuk	lunitik	jrib here is an example "sudo apt-get update" ENTER PASSWORD $
2011-10-14T02:31:00.000Z	andeeeuk	lunitik	jrib. thats exactly what is returned and it is nothing
2011-10-14T02:31:00.000Z	lunitik	andeeeuk	seriously though, it would be quicker to do a fresh install than assist, since this is a new install anyway so I doubt you have done much
2011-10-14T02:32:00.000Z	lunitik	andeeeuk	maybe go into software center and save any package changes to oneconf first so there is less to do later
2011-10-14T02:32:00.000Z	andeeeuk	lunitik	i updated from the update manager, it was not a fresh install i have a lot of really important work on here
2011-10-14T02:33:00.000Z	lunitik	andeeeuk	back it up and reinstall, or simply don't overwrite the /home partition if you separated it... either way, I have no idea what has happened, but I don't see how to fix it either
2011-10-14T02:34:00.000Z	andeeeuk	lunitik	yeah ok I will do that. Thanks for your help. Sorry about the shocking messages. Just beware of this issue
