2011-04-26T06:30:00.000Z	Darwon		no, that wont work for this
2011-04-26T06:30:00.000Z	Darwon		yes, mjn, but the first app I used didnt work
2011-04-26T06:30:00.000Z	nit-wit	Darwon	might be worth looking at be careful. http://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/TestDisk
2011-04-26T06:31:00.000Z	Darwon	mjn	Im not sure how chkdsk would help
2011-04-26T06:31:00.000Z	Darwon		thanks nitwit
2011-04-26T06:31:00.000Z	nit-wit		no problem
2011-04-26T06:31:00.000Z	Darwon		Ive tried ntfsundelete but it does individual files
2011-04-26T06:32:00.000Z	Darwon		the other issue is, that the options for my gpg keyserver is unsafe and it wont let me add anything
2011-04-26T06:36:00.000Z	Darwon	mjn	trying to recover a deleted directory from an NTFS partition
2011-04-26T06:36:00.000Z	Darwon		someone suggested testdisk, but willing to hear all options
2011-04-26T06:36:00.000Z	Darwon	mjn	all suggestions are appreciated regardless, thank you for contributing in an effort to help
2011-04-26T06:38:00.000Z	Darwon		I will tell you, but they would rather hack you then help you
2011-04-26T06:39:00.000Z	Darwon		ok, on 2nd thought, I wont tell you :)
2011-04-26T06:44:00.000Z	Darwon		lol @ more interested in terrorism
2011-04-26T06:45:00.000Z	Darwon		nitwit, testdisk is finding the same files as the windows app
2011-04-26T06:45:00.000Z	Darwon		any other suggestions?
2011-04-26T06:48:00.000Z	nit-wit	Darwon	I have never had to recover like this I have everything cloned or saved externally so I'm at bets not much help.
