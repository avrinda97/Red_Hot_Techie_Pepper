2008-05-22T02:58:00.000Z	suspended_an		has anyone got any ideas why my ubuntu would stick on "starting up"?
2008-05-22T02:59:00.000Z	suspended_an		it worked fine off the livecd, and I installed it on the hard drive and then it just didn't work :(
2008-05-22T02:59:00.000Z	danza_secondo	suspended_an	... you can try to remove the silent keyword into boot 'rules'
2008-05-22T02:59:00.000Z	suspended_an	danza_secondo	how would I go about doing that?
2008-05-22T03:16:00.000Z	danza_secondo	suspended_an	have you tried what I said?
2008-05-22T03:17:00.000Z	danza_secondo	suspended_an	perfect
2008-05-22T03:17:00.000Z	danza_secondo	suspended_an	you have to delete the quiet keyword
2008-05-22T03:18:00.000Z	danza_secondo	suspended_an	is in that parameters you can edit
2008-05-22T03:19:00.000Z	danza_secondo	suspended_an	after the kernel, that long long name, you have to scroll  the line maybe
2008-05-22T03:19:00.000Z	danza_secondo	suspended_an	ok you have to delete the quiet and splash
2008-05-22T03:19:00.000Z	danza_secondo	suspended_an	delete that words... so the system will boot with extra debug informations for you, and for us!!
2008-05-22T03:20:00.000Z	danza_secondo	suspended_an	nothing? nor some output?
2008-05-22T03:20:00.000Z	danza_secondo	suspended_an	I see...
2008-05-22T03:20:00.000Z	danza_secondo	suspended_an	Do you have a custom kernel?
2008-05-22T03:21:00.000Z	danza_secondo	suspended_an	do you compiled the kernel?
2008-05-22T03:21:00.000Z	danza_secondo	suspended_an	ok, so it isn't custom
2008-05-22T03:21:00.000Z	danza_secondo	suspended_an	nah, don't care of it
2008-05-22T03:22:00.000Z	suspended_an	danza_secondo	no worries, thanks anyway!
