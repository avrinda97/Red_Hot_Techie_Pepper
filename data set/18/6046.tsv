2008-08-28T11:30:00.000Z	sugi		How do I listen to live radio streams from the internet?
2008-08-28T11:30:00.000Z	sugi		!radio
2008-08-28T11:31:00.000Z	hateball	sugi	From where, what format etc?
2008-08-28T11:32:00.000Z	sugi	hateball	well, on the website.  it just opens up a new window and it streams from there, but there is an option to download a small file in the format of .m3u
2008-08-28T11:33:00.000Z	hateball	sugi	You should be able to open those .m3u in Rhythmbox or VLC for instance
2008-08-28T11:33:00.000Z	hateball	sugi	Provided you have installed the restricted codecs
2008-08-28T11:33:00.000Z	sugi	hateball	i open it in movie player and it didn't work.  i also tried in rhythmbox
2008-08-28T11:34:00.000Z	hateball	sugi	Care to provide a link?
2008-08-28T11:34:00.000Z	sugi	hateball	i did this command "sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras"
2008-08-28T11:35:00.000Z	sugi	hateball	www.dancefactoryfm.com/ (it's a good channel :D my friend from ill told me about it
2008-08-28T11:37:00.000Z	hateball	sugi	Works just fine in Totem for me... Not sure exactly what restricted extras bring, but you might need some gstreamer-bad/ugly stuff too
2008-08-28T11:38:00.000Z	sugi	hateball	 could you give me the command to still it?
2008-08-28T11:39:00.000Z	hateball	sugi	apt-get install gstreamer0.10-plugins-good, there's also bad and ugly
2008-08-28T11:39:00.000Z	hateball	sugi	Not sure which one that stream would need
2008-08-28T11:41:00.000Z	sugi	hateball	thanks
2008-08-28T11:50:00.000Z	sugi	hateball	I think it's working
2008-08-28T11:51:00.000Z	hateball	sugi	Well if music plays, then it's working ;)
2008-08-28T11:51:00.000Z	sugi	hateball	ha ha ha, I can't tell, but in totem vis. is moving (my cpu is way too high >.<)
