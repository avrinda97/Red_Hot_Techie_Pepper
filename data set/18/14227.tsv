2006-05-22T08:40:00.000Z	chapium		how do you make your resolution go higher than 1280x1024?
2006-05-22T08:41:00.000Z	intelikey	chapium	setup xorg correctly.  then adj. rez. as you like.
2006-05-22T08:42:00.000Z	chapium	intelikey	what do you mean by set it up correctly?  I think its fairly correct
2006-05-22T08:44:00.000Z	intelikey	chapium	if the xorg.conf is correct then the options will be in the system menu to adjust to max rez  if the choice is not there then it's not setup correctly.     the default is seldon ever configured for maximum performance.
