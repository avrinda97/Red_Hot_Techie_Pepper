2008-09-14T22:51:00.000Z	ndf		what languages does vim support code completion for?
2008-09-14T22:51:00.000Z	ndf		oops wrong win
2008-09-14T22:52:00.000Z	Seveas	ndf	ls /usr/share/vim/vim71/syntax/ -- and you can create your own syntax definitions too :)
2008-09-14T23:05:00.000Z	Seveas	ndf	no root password :)
2008-09-14T23:05:00.000Z	ndf	Seveas	lol ok
2008-09-14T23:06:00.000Z	ndf	Seveas	iirc, the root passwd is the same as the first user
2008-09-14T23:06:00.000Z	Seveas	ndf	that is most definitely not true and never has been
2008-09-14T23:09:00.000Z	Seveas	ndf	security best practice is not to have too many privileges you don't need
2008-09-14T23:12:00.000Z	Seveas	ndf	in the near-ish future sudo/su/rootlogins won't even be needed at all anymore. Using dbus/policykit, applications are securely split into a deamon running as root and a frontend running as a regular user
2008-09-14T23:12:00.000Z	Seveas	ndf	yeah, I don't understand why people are making such a fuss either. They probably don't understand :)
2008-09-14T23:14:00.000Z	Seveas	ndf	you can already see it in ubuntu 8.04 and later, several dialogs have an 'unlock' button that iirc uses this mechanism of elevating privileges
2008-09-14T23:14:00.000Z	ndf	Seveas	isn't that just gksudo?
2008-09-14T23:15:00.000Z	Seveas	ndf	no, those are different. The update manager still uses gksudo for instance
2008-09-14T23:17:00.000Z	ndf	Seveas	you from the uk?
2008-09-14T23:17:00.000Z	Seveas	ndf	no
2008-09-14T23:18:00.000Z	Seveas	ndf	holland
2008-09-14T23:19:00.000Z	Seveas	ndf	it better be, I speak more english than dutch on a daily basis at work ;)
2008-09-14T23:19:00.000Z	ndf	Seveas	oh right, cool.
