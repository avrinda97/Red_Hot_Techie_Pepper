2009-11-05T14:13:00.000Z	coolpro1		http://pastebin.com/m3c7e1e77 hello, i have apache server, but it's problem with 80 port, i forwarded the port in my router. but it still doesn't work. can anyone check if the 80 is successfully working?
2009-11-05T14:13:00.000Z	coolpro1		there is netstat
2009-11-05T14:14:00.000Z	tyler_d1	coolpro1	why is your ip 0.0.0.0???
2009-11-05T14:15:00.000Z	tyler_d1	coolpro1	and what happens when you do telnet <<boxip>> 80 from another machine (same network)
2009-11-05T14:15:00.000Z	coolpro1	tyler_d1	i don't know. but other ports works. as u can see, 82, 8080. they works fine.
2009-11-05T14:15:00.000Z	coolpro1		the only problem is with 80 port.
2009-11-05T14:15:00.000Z	coolpro1		yes
2009-11-05T14:15:00.000Z	coolpro1		it's my wan i
2009-11-05T14:15:00.000Z	coolpro1		ip
2009-11-05T14:16:00.000Z	coolpro1		apache is listening on 80, 82 and 8080 port
2009-11-05T14:16:00.000Z	tyler_d1	coolpro1	so whats your domain? as well, check httpd.conf and ensure that Listen is set to the correct ip.
2009-11-05T14:17:00.000Z	coolpro1		i didn't set ip. Just, Listen 80, Listen 82, Listen 8080
2009-11-05T14:17:00.000Z	coolpro1		and 82, and 8080 works fine.
2009-11-05T14:17:00.000Z	coolpro1		i forwarded all the ports to my local machine.
2009-11-05T14:17:00.000Z	tyler_d1	coolpro1	what do the logs say?
2009-11-05T14:17:00.000Z	coolpro1		apache logs?
2009-11-05T14:17:00.000Z	tyler_d1	coolpro1	using what util did you do your port forwarding?
2009-11-05T14:18:00.000Z	tyler_d1	coolpro1	yes
