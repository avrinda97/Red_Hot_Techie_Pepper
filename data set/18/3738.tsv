2009-10-08T21:30:00.000Z	Tired_		Hi.  I was wondering if it's possible to start an Ubuntu install from a Live distro that isn't Ubuntu or Knoppix.
2009-10-08T21:30:00.000Z	Tired_		Cuz it's what I have on hand.
2009-10-08T21:31:00.000Z	Tired_		I don't want to buy a new flash drive or external CD-ROM for my netbook
2009-10-08T21:31:00.000Z	Tired_		No, I mean a netbook install
2009-10-08T21:32:00.000Z	Tired_		I have an existing linux live distro (i'm on it now), and I want to install ubuntu to my hard drive.  this is currently running off an SD card
2009-10-08T21:34:00.000Z	Tired_		they will support an ubuntu install there, but not here?
2009-10-08T21:34:00.000Z	Tired_		weird
2009-10-08T21:35:00.000Z	Tired_		thanks, i'll be sure to tell them you sent me
2009-10-08T21:36:00.000Z	Tired_		yes, but that will destroy my working backtrack
2009-10-08T21:36:00.000Z	mnaines	Tired_	Why don't you want to install Ubuntu to the internal hard drive?
2009-10-08T21:36:00.000Z	Tired_	mnaines	I do.
2009-10-08T21:37:00.000Z	Tired_	mnaines	i want that exactly
2009-10-08T21:37:00.000Z	Tired_	mnaines	no cd drive.  netbook
2009-10-08T21:38:00.000Z	mnaines	Tired_	I rest my case.  You could have stuck with a standard laptop
2009-10-08T21:39:00.000Z	Tired_	mnaines	that's nice.  i appreciate your opinion.  now, can the ubuntu installer be called from an existing linux enviornment?
2009-10-08T21:39:00.000Z	mnaines	Tired_	Not that I am aware of.  I have never tried installing Ubuntu from BackTrack 3
2009-10-08T21:41:00.000Z	mnaines	Tired_	Your best bet is to just burn Ubuntu to the flash drive, then install it onto the hard drive then reinstall BackTrack 3 to the flash drive
2009-10-08T21:42:00.000Z	mnaines	Tired_	It would have been better if you would have had access to a CD drive
