2008-06-27T09:11:00.000Z	dmsuperman	SrgSantos54	if you're dropping packets it's a network issue...likely you have a bad connection between you and the server
2008-06-27T09:11:00.000Z	SrgSantos54	dmsuperman	how can i fix that ?!?
2008-06-27T09:11:00.000Z	dmsuperman	SrgSantos54	choose another server, make sure ports are forwarded....power cycle your router and modem
2008-06-27T09:12:00.000Z	dmsuperman	SrgSantos54	it's not something you just "fix" most of the time, like there's no setting to change
2008-06-27T09:12:00.000Z	SrgSantos54	dmsuperman	how do i know what ports to open
2008-06-27T09:12:00.000Z	dmsuperman	SrgSantos54	it's just how the internet works sometimes...you don't always have the best connection
2008-06-27T09:12:00.000Z	dmsuperman	SrgSantos54	portforward.com has a great guide
2008-06-27T09:12:00.000Z	dmsuperman	SrgSantos54	it's up to the game
2008-06-27T09:12:00.000Z	SrgSantos54	dmsuperman	: thanks
2008-06-27T09:12:00.000Z	dmsuperman	SrgSantos54	no problem
2008-06-27T09:19:00.000Z	dmsuperman	SrgSantos54	portforward.com has a great guide
2008-06-27T09:20:00.000Z	dmsuperman	SrgSantos54	it tells you how. It asks you which model your router is, and also what game you're using
