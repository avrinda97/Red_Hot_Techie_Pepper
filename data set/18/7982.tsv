2007-10-24T03:03:00.000Z	Ljorring		my 'direct rendering' is somehow disabled. How can I enable it? I have a Radeon 9600
2007-10-24T03:04:00.000Z	crdlb	Ljorring	are you using the restricted driver?
2007-10-24T03:04:00.000Z	Ljorring	crdlb	how can I check for that?
2007-10-24T03:04:00.000Z	crdlb	Ljorring	system>administration>restricted drivers manager
2007-10-24T03:05:00.000Z	Ljorring	crdlb	the checkbox at my Graphics is 'Checked' under 'Restricted Drivers Manager'
2007-10-24T03:06:00.000Z	crdlb	Ljorring	pastebin your /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2007-10-24T03:08:00.000Z	Ljorring	crdlb	I got that file open in a text editor now. What do you mean by 'pastebin'..?
2007-10-24T03:12:00.000Z	Ljorring	crdlb	I got it uploaded now I think @  http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/41861/
2007-10-24T03:20:00.000Z	crdlb	Ljorring	pastebin the output of glxinfo
2007-10-24T03:23:00.000Z	Ljorring	crdlb	glxinfo @ http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/41862/
2007-10-24T03:23:00.000Z	crdlb	Ljorring	ah, you're using Xgl
2007-10-24T03:24:00.000Z	Ljorring	crdlb	I dont know what Xgl is... I assume it's a bad thing now? :)
2007-10-24T03:25:00.000Z	crdlb	Ljorring	it's how you run compiz on the restricted ATI drivers (unless you use the very latest release)
2007-10-24T03:27:00.000Z	Ljorring	crdlb	so to get direct rendering, I ahve to disable compiz?
2007-10-24T03:27:00.000Z	crdlb	Ljorring	more or less
2007-10-24T03:28:00.000Z	Ljorring	crdlb	ok, thanks for your time. I really appreciate it. I may return later?
2007-10-25T00:21:00.000Z	Ljorring	crdlb	I still cant get compiz up. It says 'Fatal: GLX_EXT_texture_from_pixmap is missing'
2007-10-25T00:21:00.000Z	crdlb	Ljorring	wrong channel :)
