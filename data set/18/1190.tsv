2011-10-10T14:29:00.000Z	AFD	ActionParsnip	thank you ;)
2011-10-16T15:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AFD	install unp and you can run:   unp filename.rar
2011-10-16T15:24:00.000Z	AFD	ActionParsnip	Thanks I'll give it a whirl
2011-10-16T15:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AFD	there is also:  rar r file  to attempt a repair
2011-10-16T15:25:00.000Z	AFD	ActionParsnip	sweet! thank you
2011-10-16T15:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AFD	man rar    works great ;)
2011-10-16T15:25:00.000Z	AFD	ActionParsnip	DOH! I'm a relative n00b and always forgetting about the manpages...
2011-10-16T15:36:00.000Z	AFD	ActionParsnip	the repair + unp did the trick. thanks again ;)
2011-10-16T15:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AFD	np man. Unp is awesome
2012-01-23T13:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AFD	you can set autologin by editting lightdm's config files in root recovery mode at the very least
2012-01-23T13:26:00.000Z	AFD	ActionParsnip	Thanks! I hadn't thought about getting to use sudo that way
2012-01-23T13:26:00.000Z	AFD	ActionParsnip	I'm being locked out of my install. I just need to get in to back up some files and then reinstall
2012-01-23T13:27:00.000Z	AFD	ActionParsnip	in under recovery as root :D
2012-01-23T13:30:00.000Z	AFD	ActionParsnip	so I still get the login prompt which is lacking my user (nothing to click and enter password in to)... what do I need to do to lightdm?
2012-01-23T13:39:00.000Z	AFD	ActionParsnip	if i remove gdm will I boot straight in to the desktop? or should I delete the user passwd too?
2012-05-19T20:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AFD	using what GPU?
2012-05-19T20:01:00.000Z	AFD	ActionParsnip	Intel 965GM
