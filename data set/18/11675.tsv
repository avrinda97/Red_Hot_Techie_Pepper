2007-01-10T16:20:00.000Z	gnufied		is there any to get around of "lGdk-WARNING **:locale not supported by Xlib" ?
2007-01-10T16:21:00.000Z	ikonia	gnufied	where do you get that ?
2007-01-10T16:21:00.000Z	gnufied	ikonia	whenever any gtk app starts
2007-01-10T16:22:00.000Z	ikonia	gnufied	do you have a $LC_LOCAL varible
2007-01-10T16:22:00.000Z	gnufied	ikonia	i don't think so
2007-01-10T16:22:00.000Z	gnufied	ikonia	i had that option when i did dpkg-reconfigure localeconf, but wasn't sure what to choose
2007-01-21T15:45:00.000Z	ikonia	gnufied	in what way
2007-01-21T15:46:00.000Z	ikonia	gnufied	not sure what you mean
2007-01-21T15:46:00.000Z	gnufied	ikonia	i want *.xaos point to localhost, without playing with dns settings. because I am working locally.
2007-01-21T15:46:00.000Z	ikonia	gnufied	so just put in an alias
2007-01-21T15:46:00.000Z	gnufied	ikonia	where?
2007-01-21T15:47:00.000Z	ikonia	gnufied	/etc/hsots
2007-01-21T15:47:00.000Z	gnufied	ikonia	hmm can you tell me the line
2007-01-21T15:47:00.000Z	gnufied	ikonia	when i say 127.0.0.1 *.xaos in /etc/hosts file it doesn't work
2007-01-21T15:47:00.000Z	ikonia	gnufied	 127.0.0.1 localhost bigbox
2007-01-21T15:48:00.000Z	gnufied	ikonia	ok but i am generating subdomains dynamically and i can't possibly type all the entries
2007-01-21T15:48:00.000Z	gnufied	ikonia	and hence i need regular expressions
2007-01-21T15:48:00.000Z	ikonia	gnufied	you need some clever scripting
