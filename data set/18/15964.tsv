2004-12-14T17:29:00.000Z	zooko		Now I've tried both, to no avail.
2004-12-14T17:30:00.000Z	zooko		Okay, I also tried adding the apt-source maintained by the darcs people.  The line they suggest is:
2004-12-14T17:30:00.000Z	zooko		deb http://abridgegame.org/debian/ woody/
2004-12-14T17:30:00.000Z	zooko		as written here:
2004-12-14T17:30:00.000Z	zooko		http://www.scannedinavian.org/DarcsWiki/CategoryBinaries#head-4e7d1aacd7618015f43023071a3cecd3724cfad0
2004-12-14T17:30:00.000Z	zooko		But then it says "Hit" and then "Ign" on that line when I run apt-get update.
2004-12-14T17:31:00.000Z	zooko		I guess it is "Ign"oring it because it is from a release named "woody" ?
2004-12-14T17:32:00.000Z	zooko		okay, now I'll dl the .deb file from the darcs devels and try dpkg -i on it.  :-)
2004-12-14T17:32:00.000Z	zooko		This is the very first thing I'm doing on my new Ubuntu athlon64 system, because I want to put system files under darcs revision control before changing them.
2004-12-14T17:32:00.000Z	zooko		My Radeon 9250 card isn't detected, so I want to debug that, but first put XF86Config-4 and so forth into darcs.
2004-12-14T17:32:00.000Z	topyli	zooko	i see darcs with apt
2004-12-14T17:33:00.000Z	zooko	topyli	thanks!  So I'm doing something wrong here...
2004-12-14T17:35:00.000Z	topyli	zooko	dunno, the package says its origin is "Ubuntu"
2004-12-14T17:36:00.000Z	zooko	topyli	so can you tell which apt-source line is necessary for you to see darcs?
2004-12-14T17:36:00.000Z	topyli	zooko	pool/universe/d/darcs/darcs_0.9.22-1_i386.deb
2004-12-14T17:36:00.000Z	zooko	topyli	thanks!
2005-04-15T08:20:00.000Z	topyli	zooko	you probably want to have either cd or floppy to boot from on any machine, makes life easier :)
2005-10-31T17:38:00.000Z	topyli	zooko	whatever useful you think up, you can add it to the wiki
