2009-06-28T10:59:00.000Z	EvRide		um, why?
2009-06-28T11:00:00.000Z	EvRide		well it's easier than opening up a command prompt and typing in a command you forget easily
2009-06-28T11:00:00.000Z	EvRide		I'm learning it, but i don't think there should be a learning curve to Operating systems
2009-06-28T11:01:00.000Z	EvRide		operating systems should be easy to use, have an easy way to get everything done without the need for a command prompt
2009-06-28T11:02:00.000Z	EvRide		yes, but when you have to memorize dozens of others it becomes a pain
2009-06-28T11:02:00.000Z	EvRide		well I like Ubuntu, but it's such a pain to get started in
2009-06-28T11:03:00.000Z	EvRide		uh, ya in that instance he does
2009-06-28T11:03:00.000Z	EvRide		he can use gmount iso
2009-06-28T11:04:00.000Z	EvRide		sometimes GUIs are the easier and quicker way to do things
2009-06-28T11:04:00.000Z	EvRide		I mean opening up the command prompt and typing something in would take much longer
2009-06-28T11:05:00.000Z	mechdave	EvRide	I use the command line extensively, I find it much quicker than graphics
2009-06-28T11:05:00.000Z	EvRide	mechdave	and you
2009-06-28T11:05:00.000Z	mechdave	EvRide	When I started out I bought a book about UNIX as I didn't have the internet back then
2009-06-28T11:07:00.000Z	mechdave	EvRide	Why not? UNIX has been around since the 70's and it is one of the most powerful OS's out there. Unfortunately windows has made people lazy in the OS arena
2009-06-28T11:08:00.000Z	mechdave	EvRide	Lol
2009-06-28T11:10:00.000Z	mechdave	EvRide	You are doing alright, you have managed to install Ubuntu and find your way here, in the least that shows more commitment than the average windows user :)
2009-06-28T11:12:00.000Z	mechdave	EvRide	True, I do most of my development on Ubuntu, once I have it up and running it is rock solid and doesn't crash just because I open a folder (unlike XP pro) :(
2009-06-28T11:14:00.000Z	mechdave	EvRide	Same with Ubuntu ;)
