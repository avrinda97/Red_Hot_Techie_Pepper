2007-03-02T09:11:00.000Z	h1st0	concept10	what auto remove stuff?
2007-03-02T09:11:00.000Z	concept10	h1st0	apt-get autoremove
2007-03-02T09:11:00.000Z	h1st0	concept10	What do you want to do?
2007-03-02T09:12:00.000Z	concept10	h1st0	I want to turn it off
2007-03-02T09:12:00.000Z	concept10	h1st0	I dont want autoremove to remind me of that
2007-03-02T09:12:00.000Z	h1st0	concept10	well then run sudo apt-get autoremove
2007-03-02T09:12:00.000Z	h1st0	concept10	to fix it.
2007-03-02T09:13:00.000Z	concept10	h1st0	never mind - youre not getting it
2007-03-02T09:13:00.000Z	h1st0	concept10	No, I'm not I can't see your screen so I don't know what you are trying to do.
2007-03-02T09:14:00.000Z	h1st0	concept10	from the brief bit you've told me I assume its because you are getting a message to run apt-get autoremove.  Well if you run it that message will go away.
2007-03-02T09:14:00.000Z	concept10	h1st0	I said - "I want to turn it off"  That means I don't want it to manage my packages in this way.
2007-03-02T09:14:00.000Z	h1st0	concept10	ahh. Well you could flag the packages it wants to remove to keep them.
2007-03-02T09:15:00.000Z	h1st0	concept10	but as far as turning that feature off I dunno if there is a config for apt-get
2007-03-02T09:16:00.000Z	concept10	h1st0	the reason why is this, I remove a package from the xubuntu-desktop meta-package, for example like gnumeric, and autoremove reminds me everytime to remove the rest of the xubuntu-desktop
2007-03-02T09:17:00.000Z	h1st0	concept10	There is no way to fix that. xubuntu-desktp is just a meta package and doesn't containt anything.
2007-03-02T09:17:00.000Z	h1st0	concept10	but if you remove a package that xubuntu-desktop depends on it wants to remove xubuntu-desktop by default.  You can safely remove it and not worry.
2007-03-02T09:18:00.000Z	concept10	h1st0	I know I can safely remove, but I dont want autoremove reminding me to remove the rest of the contents of the meta-package
