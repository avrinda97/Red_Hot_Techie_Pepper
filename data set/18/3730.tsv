2009-12-27T18:45:00.000Z	jMyles	SETKEH	 I've been trying to play and familiarize myself more with the nuances of pulseaudio, but I don't know much about input.  It there a setting in skype to decide which input to use?

2009-12-27T18:47:00.000Z	jMyles	SETKEH	Sure.  I'm not sure if I'll be able to help, but I think somebody will, and I'm curious about what answer you find.  I'd be glad to take a look.
2009-12-27T18:47:00.000Z	jMyles	SETKEH	I don't skype, but I don't mind downloading it to take a look.

2009-12-27T18:49:00.000Z	jMyles	SETKEH	One tool that I have found valuable is pafrefs - pulseaudio preferences.  Have you tried it?  sudo apt-get install paprefs

2009-12-27T18:52:00.000Z	jMyles	SETKEH	I don't know that it has anything that will help you, but it's good to have when troubleshooting sound issues with pulseaudio
2009-12-27T18:54:00.000Z	SETKEH	jMyles	i have set that up according to a tutorial that got me the sound i can hear lol just no input
