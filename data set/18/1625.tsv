2011-01-06T21:54:00.000Z	nits_hunter	Dwade09	means there is a prob with ur /etc/fstab file
2011-01-06T21:54:00.000Z	Dwade09	nits_hunter	 how i fix this?
2011-01-06T21:54:00.000Z	nits_hunter	Dwade09	sudo blkid gives the list of UUID's
2011-01-06T21:55:00.000Z	nits_hunter	Dwade09	 check the UUID's from sudo blkid against gksudo gedit /etc/fstab and correct them as required :)
2011-01-06T21:56:00.000Z	nits_hunter	Dwade09	do u understand or do u want me to put it down step-wise?
2011-01-06T21:56:00.000Z	Dwade09	nits_hunter	 i got it thank you . but i do have a issue with my fstab
2011-01-06T21:57:00.000Z	nits_hunter	Dwade09	if u fix the UUID's in fstab u shouldnt get that error, btw is it a different prob u have with fstab?
