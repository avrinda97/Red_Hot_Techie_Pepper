2007-01-01T12:59:00.000Z	jasin		I'm happy with my 3ghz celery cpu :p
2007-01-01T12:59:00.000Z	jasin		no need for 64 bit here.
2007-01-01T12:59:00.000Z	jasin		hymntolife, not really
2007-01-01T13:00:00.000Z	jasin		hymntolife, chekc pricewatch
2007-01-01T13:01:00.000Z	jasin		64bit is supposedly more effecient but like nolimitsoya said, all your apps must be 64bit for you to benefit.
2007-01-01T13:02:00.000Z	jasin		hell, 64 bit is really nothing, 64 bit microprocessor have been around for over 8 years now.
2007-01-01T13:03:00.000Z	jasin		hell, there's already 256bit microprocessors on the market, granted their not x86 tho.
2007-01-01T13:03:00.000Z	kitche	jasin	well considering x86_64 is not 64bit really there isnt much of a difference
2007-01-01T13:03:00.000Z	jasin	kitche	true
2007-01-04T09:14:00.000Z	kitche	jasin	he knows he doesn't have universe enabled

2007-04-21T05:32:00.000Z	kitche	jasin	the alternate cd is for people that don't like the livecd and it's debian like
2007-04-21T05:33:00.000Z	jasin	kitche	see the response I gave jrib
2007-04-21T05:34:00.000Z	kitche	jasin	what does that have to do with my response I don't like the livecd sicne I have tons of them anyways and the livecd needs more then 256 mb but gnoem can run on 256 megs of ram easily
2007-04-21T05:35:00.000Z	jasin	kitche	then we are in agreement, I dont like live cd's much either
2007-06-11T05:29:00.000Z	kitche	jasin	maybe for work or school prehaps
2007-06-11T05:30:00.000Z	kitche	jasin	I need windows for college since most of my programming stuff deals with window stuff
