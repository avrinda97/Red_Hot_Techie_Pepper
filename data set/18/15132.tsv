2005-05-01T11:46:00.000Z	mjc		suspend = suspend to ram
2005-05-01T11:47:00.000Z	mjc		hibernate should take a minute or two
2005-05-01T11:47:00.000Z	mjc		suspend should take 10 seconds or so
2005-05-01T11:47:00.000Z	mjc		you're confusing hibernate and suspend
2005-05-01T11:48:00.000Z	mjc		fstab is for mounting at boot time
2005-05-01T11:48:00.000Z	mjc		/etc/fstab
