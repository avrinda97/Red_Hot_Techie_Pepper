2008-07-12T11:34:00.000Z	libflashsupport		hello, is libflashsupport still required for flash 10?
2008-07-12T11:35:00.000Z	Jordan_U	libflashsupport	It never was
2008-07-12T11:35:00.000Z	libflashsupport	Jordan_U	in flash9 there was an issue with the audio that prompted me to install libflashsupport.
2008-07-12T11:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	libflashsupport	Sorry, yes, if you want to be able to use flash and use applications that are set to output to pulseaudio you need either libflashsupport or there is a more stable alternative you can grab from intrepid
2008-07-12T11:37:00.000Z	libflashsupport	Jordan_U	which is flash 10, I guess?
2008-07-12T11:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	libflashsupport	No, it's an alsa package
2008-07-12T11:38:00.000Z	libflashsupport	Jordan_U	weird...
2008-07-12T11:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U	libflashsupport	It will work with flash 9 as well AFIK
2008-07-12T11:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	libflashsupport	There is a difference between flash10 and the intrepid package for flash 10, the intrepid package for flash 10 depends on things which are only available in intrepid ( because that is what it was made for ) but flash 10 itself does not ( though it won't work with pulseaudio without some extra package )
2008-07-12T11:41:00.000Z	Jordan_U	libflashsupport	That is the more stable alternative to libflashplugin
2008-07-12T11:42:00.000Z	Jordan_U	libflashsupport	You will need to get it from intrepid as well
2008-07-12T11:42:00.000Z	libflashsupport	Jordan_U	I see. But there is no need to update libasound2-plugins I suppose?
2008-07-12T11:42:00.000Z	Jordan_U	libflashsupport	Someone said earlier that there is something important about the intrepid version
2008-07-12T11:44:00.000Z	libflashsupport	Jordan_U	are those intrepid versions? If libasound2-plugin is required from the intrepid version how would I go about installing it?
2008-07-12T11:44:00.000Z	Jordan_U	libflashsupport	get it from packages.ubuntu.com
2008-07-12T11:48:00.000Z	libflashsupport	Jordan_U	since audio works on other stuff and on flash without libflashsupport installed now I suppose that it's not a very big deal then?
2008-07-12T11:49:00.000Z	Jordan_U	libflashsupport	I guess, are you using pulseaudio ? ( if not then you don't need libasound-2-plugins or libflashsupport )
2008-07-12T11:50:00.000Z	libflashsupport	Jordan_U	yeah, I am. It comes installed on hardy.
