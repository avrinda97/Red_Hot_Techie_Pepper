2011-06-22T13:17:00.000Z	ubuntuNoob		having trouble booting up all of a sudden.  I get the Grub menu with 4 options:  a) ubuntu xxx-generic  b) ubuntu xxx-generic (recovery mode)  c &d memory test.    When i select a)  i get a black (dos) like screen with BusyBox v1.17.1.   Any help greatly appreciated...i've been working on turning in my final exam project tomorrow.
2011-06-22T13:17:00.000Z	p1oooop	ubuntuNoob	what's the menu entry for the first option?
2011-06-22T13:18:00.000Z	p1oooop	ubuntuNoob	actually, it might be better if you pastebin it...
2011-06-22T13:18:00.000Z	ubuntuNoob	p1oooop	 what do you mean menu entry?
2011-06-22T13:18:00.000Z	p1oooop	ubuntuNoob	if you absolutely need to get stuff done quick, I recommend live USB booting ;)
2011-06-22T13:18:00.000Z	p1oooop	ubuntuNoob	erm... the grub config.
2011-06-22T13:19:00.000Z	ubuntuNoob	p1oooop	there's an option for 'editing' the grub option.    it shows something like ... set root='(/dev/sda,msdos1)
2011-06-22T13:19:00.000Z	p1oooop		and I should really freaking take a shower.. in fact, I don't even know why I'm in here.
2011-06-22T13:20:00.000Z	ubuntuNoob	p1oooop	please to take a shower yet =D
2011-06-22T13:20:00.000Z	p1oooop	ubuntuNoob	hm, msdos?
2011-06-22T13:20:00.000Z	ubuntuNoob	p1oooop	i have no idea why it says msdos..... this was a pure msdos box.
2011-06-22T13:20:00.000Z	p1oooop	ubuntuNoob	ahh, I see...
2011-06-22T13:20:00.000Z	ubuntuNoob	p1oooop	 whooops..i meant...pure linux box.
2011-06-22T13:20:00.000Z	p1oooop	ubuntuNoob	LOL.
2011-06-22T13:21:00.000Z	p1oooop	ubuntuNoob	hm, that's odd. perhaps it's the partiion table type.
2011-06-22T13:21:00.000Z	ubuntuNoob	p1oooop	  that's possible...as i had formatted a ms partition in the past
2011-06-22T13:21:00.000Z	p1oooop	ubuntuNoob	naw, it's usually an msdos partition table anyway... LOL
2011-06-22T13:22:00.000Z	p1oooop	ubuntuNoob	anyway... what do you mean by a busybox?
