2008-02-13T18:05:00.000Z	reallyjoel		How can I change permissions on a disk(ntfs partition) via the command line?
2008-02-13T18:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	reallyjoel	 you remount it with the proper options is the proper way.
2008-02-13T18:06:00.000Z	reallyjoel	Dr_Willis	Proper options? I have remounted but its always readonly
2008-02-13T18:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	reallyjoel	 ntfs is read only, ntfs-3g is r/w -   May be your issue
2008-02-13T18:07:00.000Z	reallyjoel	Dr_Willis	no i have ntfs3g
2008-02-13T18:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	reallyjoel	 IF windows did not properly unmount the windows disk, or its some how  unclean. it will also get mounted read only for saftey reasons
2008-02-13T18:08:00.000Z	reallyjoel	Dr_Willis	i think the problem is that i didnt check the right box in the config tool.. the "internal" option is greyed out
2008-02-13T18:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	reallyjoel	 highly likely. :)
2008-02-13T18:09:00.000Z	reallyjoel	Dr_Willis	but why would it be greyed out_
2008-02-13T18:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	reallyjoel	 no idea. Mine are not. You did run ntfs-config with sudo?
2008-02-13T18:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	reallyjoel	 could be theres no fstab entry at all for the internal disk.  so its ignoring it.
2008-02-13T18:09:00.000Z	reallyjoel	Dr_Willis	no, i just ran it from the Applications-menu
2008-02-13T18:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	reallyjoel	 i alway do 'sudo ntfs-config'
2008-02-13T18:12:00.000Z	reallyjoel	Dr_Willis	running it with sudo dosnt make any difference
2008-02-13T18:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	reallyjoel	 i would wonder if ntfs-config only tweaks existing fstab entries for ntfs disks. You may want to manually add an entry to fstab for the disk
2008-02-13T18:13:00.000Z	reallyjoel	Dr_Willis	prince_jammys: remember im using Live CD.. could thast be it?
2008-02-13T18:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	reallyjoel	 Gee.. ya might of mentioned that earlier. :) heh heh..
2008-02-13T18:14:00.000Z	reallyjoel	Dr_Willis	hehe, I did..
