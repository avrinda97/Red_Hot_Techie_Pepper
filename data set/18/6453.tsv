2008-06-28T03:36:00.000Z	amenado		lokuazzz-> did you do what I asked?
2008-06-28T03:37:00.000Z	amenado		Danish989-> possibly, i have not digged deep to look into those
2008-06-28T03:38:00.000Z	amenado		quentusrex-> what is the ip addr of your server? may I try?

2008-06-28T03:40:00.000Z	amenado		lokuazzz-> read the output again, you may learn a thing or two
2008-06-28T03:41:00.000Z	amenado		Maps-> whats a dlink dns-323? can you elaborate?
2008-06-28T03:42:00.000Z	Maps	amenado	- the DNS-323 is a NAS with a USB port for a printer.  I can print fine from Windows, but when I "probe" for the printer from Ubuntu nothing happens...
2008-06-28T03:45:00.000Z	Maps	amenado	gway9000 - the printer doesn't get an IP.  The NAS runs a version of linux, and in Windows the printer shows up in the network neiborhood as NAS/lp
2008-06-28T03:48:00.000Z	Maps	amenado	gway9000 there's no way to give the printer an IP, and as I said it works okay in Windows, but the NAS seems to be running lpd
2008-06-28T03:49:00.000Z	Maps	amenado	gway9000 and the NAS does have a static IP, since it's the only system hardwired.  gway9000 the printer is on the USB port of the NAS which is running lpd
2008-06-28T03:50:00.000Z	Maps	amenado	gway9000 - okay Ill look into CUPS, thanks!
2008-06-28T03:51:00.000Z	Maps	amenado	roger, thanks
2008-06-28T04:00:00.000Z	Maps	amenado	- if I do `lpadmin -h nas -p lp` I get conenction refused.. if I'm logged into "nas" how can I see the socket or prot ot whatever?
2008-06-28T04:06:00.000Z	Maps	amenado	- if I do `lpadmin -h nas -p lp` I get conenction refused.. if I run nmap I see port 515/tcp is open.....
