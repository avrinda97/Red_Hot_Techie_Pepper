2008-10-19T16:34:00.000Z	mr_lou		What's the default system-password for su after a clean installation? Is it impossible to access su because I chose to use sudo?
2008-10-19T16:35:00.000Z	mr_lou		Then something must have gone wrong, because that doesn't work.
2008-10-19T16:35:00.000Z	mr_lou		But ok.
2008-10-19T16:35:00.000Z	jrib	mr_lou	what doesn't work exactly?  And *how* is it not working exactly?
2008-10-19T16:36:00.000Z	mr_lou	jrib	Password for default user just doesn't work for su.
2008-10-19T16:36:00.000Z	mr_lou		Is there any easy way of giving my terminal a black background? I looked in .bashrc, but don't think the background is set in that file.
2008-10-19T16:36:00.000Z	jrib	mr_lou	that's not what ubottu said
2008-10-19T16:36:00.000Z	jrib	mr_lou	edit -> current profile
2008-10-19T16:36:00.000Z	mr_lou		Uuh, funky.
2008-10-19T16:36:00.000Z	mr_lou		Thanks.
2008-10-19T16:37:00.000Z	mr_lou		Great. White on black. That's the one. :->
2008-10-19T16:38:00.000Z	mr_lou	jrib	Ubuntu just says "su: Authentication failure".
2008-10-19T16:38:00.000Z	jrib	mr_lou	did you read what ubottu said?  There is no root password.  You can't su to root.  Use sudo instead
2008-10-19T16:38:00.000Z	mr_lou	jrib	Right. That's what I asked. Thought I might could have both though.
2008-10-19T16:39:00.000Z	jrib	mr_lou	there's really no point.  You can do everything with sudo.  If you really think you need a root prompt, just run 'sudo -i', it's the same as 'su -'

2008-10-19T16:40:00.000Z	mr_lou	jrib	Great! Thanks. Well, sometimes when I have to do a lot of stuff using root, it's nicer to not have to type sudo all the time. That's why.
2008-10-19T16:40:00.000Z	jrib	mr_lou	right, that's where 'sudo -i' comes in
