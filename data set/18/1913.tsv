2010-11-03T17:50:00.000Z	shadow98	rigved	don't see an option for repair
2010-11-03T17:50:00.000Z	rigved	shadow98	do you see a list of broken packages?
2010-11-03T17:51:00.000Z	shadow98	rigved	where would i see a list of broken packages
2010-11-03T17:52:00.000Z	rigved	shadow98	in the aptitude main menu. you will see that as well as tasks etc.
2010-11-03T17:55:00.000Z	shadow98	rigved	i don't see any
2010-11-03T17:56:00.000Z	rigved	shadow98	1 moment
2010-11-03T18:01:00.000Z	rigved	shadow98	i remember there was a list of broken packages. but anyways, when you have a look at the installed packages, you will see some characters at the start of the line
2010-11-03T18:01:00.000Z	rigved	shadow98	if one of the characters is B, then that package is broken
2010-11-03T18:03:00.000Z	shadow98	rigved	i don't see any with B...is there way to do a apt-get repair on all installed packages..
