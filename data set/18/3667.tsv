2009-08-23T19:50:00.000Z	boss_mc	Sirmimer	it will work as a mouse out of the box, but any shortcut buttions on it/force feedback might not
2009-08-23T19:50:00.000Z	Sirmimer		i can use my mouse, but i cant use my side keys on it.
2009-08-23T19:51:00.000Z	Sirmimer		the side keys are working, but i cant bind them to anything in the game i'm playing. The way i did it on windows vista was making the two side keys to like enter and swift, and then i could bind swift ingame, and it would work for that side key.
2009-08-23T19:53:00.000Z	Sirmimer		When i installed the drivers / program called mouse pointer, i could control some settings in my mouse. Like chaning the sidekeys to be like enter/swfit, thatway i could bind them ingame, anyone know if i can do the same on linux?
