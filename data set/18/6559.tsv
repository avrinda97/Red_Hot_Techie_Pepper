2008-05-03T00:36:00.000Z	jf_		What's up with flash on hardy?
2008-05-03T00:37:00.000Z	jf_		Crashes on me ALL the time.
2008-05-03T00:37:00.000Z	jf_		It's a 50/50 chans.
2008-05-03T00:37:00.000Z	fde	jf_	Turn off Compiz.
2008-05-03T00:38:00.000Z	jf_	fde	Is it compiz that is causing it?
2008-05-03T00:38:00.000Z	fde	jf_	It will crash more with Compiz around, yes.
2008-05-03T00:38:00.000Z	jf_	fde	Never had the problem with gutsy.
2008-05-03T00:39:00.000Z	fde	jf_	It's mostly because Adobe Flash is proprietary, and thus we can't fix issues with it ourselves, and they don't care enough about Linux at this point.
2008-05-03T00:40:00.000Z	jf_	fde	Someone should buy flash and open source it. Just for fun :(
2008-05-03T00:41:00.000Z	fde	jf_	also try installing 'libflashsupport' as it apparently helps ... you too grandmaster_
2008-05-03T00:42:00.000Z	fde	jf_	Adobe already did.
2008-05-03T00:42:00.000Z	fde	jf_	Adobe are part of the Linux Foundation now, so we'll see what comes of that.
2008-05-03T00:44:00.000Z	jf_	fde	Link me to info about that plz.
2008-05-03T00:45:00.000Z	fde	jf_	http://linux-foundation.org/weblogs/press/2008/03/30/adobe-joins-linux-foundation-with-focus-on-linux-for-web-20-applications/
2008-05-03T00:45:00.000Z	fde	jf_	This is starting to deviate from support though...
2008-05-03T00:46:00.000Z	jf_	fde	Focus on Linux != Open Source?
2008-05-03T00:47:00.000Z	fde	jf_	Nope...
2008-05-03T00:47:00.000Z	fde	jf_	But generally, companies that join the Linux Foundation end up contributing to open source as part of their work.
