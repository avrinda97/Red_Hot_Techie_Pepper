2007-07-13T14:29:00.000Z	Brent_		I'm back. And more frustrated then ever
2007-07-13T14:31:00.000Z	Brent_		I'm having troubles getting GRUB to work. I can't seem to get it to actually boot any operating systems
2007-07-13T14:33:00.000Z	Brent_		I'm sorry, but that page that was linked to is just plain confusing to me
2007-07-13T14:33:00.000Z	Brent_		Grub loads, but doesn't work at all
2007-07-13T14:35:00.000Z	Brent_		How can I get GRUB loaded on my main partition? It seems to be loaded on my external drive, but I don't know why
2007-07-13T14:35:00.000Z	Brent_		And will it damage Windows or the main hard drive if I install it there?
2007-07-13T14:35:00.000Z	Brent_		I don't know how
2007-07-13T14:35:00.000Z	nickrooster	Brent_	Without doing a reinstall?
2007-07-13T14:37:00.000Z	nickrooster	Brent_	I would just reinstall
2007-07-13T14:38:00.000Z	nickrooster	Brent_	On the last page of the installer, there are advanced options that say which drive you want to install the bootloader on
2007-07-13T14:38:00.000Z	nickrooster	Brent_	By default it should install on (0,0), which is just the first hard drive in the hierarchy
2007-07-13T14:40:00.000Z	nickrooster	Brent_	Yes, it should, but only if that drive is the first one it hits when doing the boot after the POST
2007-07-13T14:41:00.000Z	nickrooster	Brent_	You want grub on whatever drive you normally boot from
2007-07-13T14:41:00.000Z	nickrooster	Brent_	Could be? That would be weird....
2007-07-13T14:41:00.000Z	nickrooster	Brent_	Was the external drive plugged in when you did the install?
2007-07-13T14:42:00.000Z	nickrooster	Brent_	Oh, well, so you want to intall ubuntu to the usb drive, but you want grub on your main drive?
2007-07-13T14:44:00.000Z	nickrooster	Brent_	well, hmmm - if you do a reinstall and format the drive, but change the option to install grub onto the other drive (which I think should be (1,0)), you should be fine
2007-07-13T14:45:00.000Z	nickrooster	Brent_	Good luck! You should be fine
