2010-01-15T07:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	blendmaster1024	 Ubuntu on it - is so slow its almost unuseable
2010-01-17T08:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	blendmaster1024	 intel i find works much better then ati.. :)
2010-01-17T08:33:00.000Z	blendmaster1024	Dr_Willis	really? you've got lucky
2010-01-17T08:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	blendmaster1024	 i see MUCH more problems in here with ATi then i do intel
2010-01-17T08:36:00.000Z	blendmaster1024	Dr_Willis	then your card must be brand-new
2010-01-17T08:38:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	blendmaster1024	 actually its over a year old.
2010-04-16T23:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	blendmaster1024	 odd. it saw mine.  Perhaps delete all partions on the flash drive first..
2010-04-16T23:43:00.000Z	blendmaster1024	Dr_Willis	that seems counter intuitive but ok
2010-04-16T23:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	blendmaster1024	 it saw my flash drives with no issue. You are trying to kick it in the head.. so ive no idea why its not seeing them..
2010-04-16T23:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	blendmaster1024	 if you do a full install to a flash drive.. dont forget to tell grub to Install to the flash drive as the last step
2010-04-16T23:45:00.000Z	blendmaster1024	Dr_Willis	i know
2010-05-12T06:35:00.000Z	blendmaster1024	Dr_Willis	but he broke dash too, and only has bash atm
2010-06-28T21:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	blendmaster1024	 short answer.. basically you dont. ive never seen any gui way to do it.
2010-06-28T21:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	blendmaster1024	 othe then finding the sound files, and copying other sounds to them.
2010-06-28T21:10:00.000Z	blendmaster1024	Dr_Willis	thought so. who is in charge of these removed features!?
2010-06-28T21:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	blendmaster1024	 see #gnome
2010-06-28T21:10:00.000Z	blendmaster1024	Dr_Willis	they need to be jailed or something else big
2010-09-01T20:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	blendmaster1024	 check the 'set' command see if theres a variable set somewhere to the info,
