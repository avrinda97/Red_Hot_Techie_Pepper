2005-12-13T09:24:00.000Z	mushroomblue		hi. how ugly is an upgrade from Warty to Breezy?
2005-12-13T09:25:00.000Z	mushroomblue		hrm. good idea.
2005-12-13T09:26:00.000Z	mushroomblue		hrm.
2005-12-13T09:26:00.000Z	mushroomblue		I'm gonna take the risk.
2005-12-13T09:26:00.000Z	mushroomblue		if it breaks, I just run over and install breezy from scratch.
2005-12-13T09:27:00.000Z	mushroomblue		hrm.
2005-12-13T09:28:00.000Z	mushroomblue		is apt-get dist-upgrade the only way to upgrade every package?
2005-12-13T09:28:00.000Z	mushroomblue		cos it's only updating 31 of them.
2005-12-13T09:28:00.000Z	mushroomblue		which confuses the hell out of me.
2005-12-13T09:29:00.000Z	thoreauputic	mushroomblue	you changed your sources.list to breezy ?
2005-12-13T09:29:00.000Z	mushroomblue	thoreauputic	yah.
2005-12-13T09:30:00.000Z	thoreauputic	mushroomblue	you ran  sudo apt-get update afterwards?
2005-12-13T09:30:00.000Z	mushroomblue	thoreauputic	yep.
2005-12-13T09:30:00.000Z	mushroomblue		hrm.
2005-12-13T09:30:00.000Z	mushroomblue		how do you get it to install all dependencies?
2005-12-13T09:31:00.000Z	mushroomblue		heh. I still like gentoo better, but yay for remote administration.
2005-12-13T09:31:00.000Z	thoreauputic	mushroomblue	 sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade  should pull in your new breezy - if not, I'm puzzled too
2005-12-13T09:31:00.000Z	mushroomblue	thoreauputic	no. I need other stuff.
