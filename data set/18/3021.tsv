2010-01-04T10:24:00.000Z	Xfact		anybody can tell me shortly , What is 'Source Code'?
2010-01-04T10:24:00.000Z	dark	Xfact	the preferred form for editing a program
2010-01-04T10:25:00.000Z	dark	Xfact	computer programs can have various forms; one can use a compiler to transform from one form to another. the form the computer usually recognizes is called object code, and the form the human beings usually write and read is called source code
2010-01-04T10:26:00.000Z	dark	Xfact	main() { puts("hello"); }
2010-01-04T10:26:00.000Z	dark	Xfact	this is the source code of a program that displays hello on the screen
2010-01-04T10:27:00.000Z	dark	Xfact	but the computer doesn't run this directly, because the computer only runs instructions of a so-called "machine language"
2010-01-04T10:29:00.000Z	Xfact	dark	well, the main story is I want to download Filezilla 3.3.1 from it's website...it's giving 2 options...one 'tar.gz' archive, and second is to download it's source code.... which I should dload? (I just want that program..)
2010-01-04T10:29:00.000Z	dark	Xfact	couldn't you use synaptic instead?
2010-01-04T10:30:00.000Z	dark	Xfact	installing programs from source code can be tedious and even arcane. but installing from another form that is not .deb might don't work at all
2010-01-04T10:30:00.000Z	dark	Xfact	did you searched for backports?
2010-01-04T10:31:00.000Z	dark	Xfact	a program compiled to an operating system might not work on another. so if you don't have a version compiled for ubuntu hardy, you maybe will have to build from source
2010-01-04T10:31:00.000Z	Xfact	dark	What is backport? (I am totally new in linux...knowledge less)
2010-01-04T10:32:00.000Z	Xfact	dark	hummm.... complicated, well, thanks for try, I think I should be happy with old version :)
2010-01-04T10:33:00.000Z	dark	Xfact	the program will never be updated on hardy, because ubuntu expect you to update everything at the same time (i.e. upgrade to another distro). but with a backport, you may use the new app on the old distro
2010-01-04T10:33:00.000Z	dark	Xfact	there is a synaptic repository called "hardy-backports", maybe you should give a try
2010-01-04T10:36:00.000Z	Xfact	dark	there no such file named hardy-backports in the synaptic.....
2010-01-04T10:37:00.000Z	dark	Xfact	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuBackports
2010-01-04T10:38:00.000Z	Xfact	dark	looking
