2004-09-27T16:56:00.000Z	sanxiyn		s/there/their/
2004-09-27T16:56:00.000Z	sanxiyn		That works too. :-)
2004-09-27T16:57:00.000Z	sanxiyn		This is an interesting read: http://www.kitenet.net/~joey/cvshome.html
2004-09-27T16:57:00.000Z	sanxiyn		(CVS $HOME, or keeping your life in CVS.)
2004-09-27T05:00:00.000Z	sanxiyn		Also this: http://svn.kitenet.net/trunk/
2004-09-27T05:00:00.000Z	sanxiyn		Mind-boggling: he has three $HOME modules, namely home-base, home-full, home-plus. ;;;
2004-09-27T05:01:00.000Z	sanxiyn		jsan: mozilla-mplayer works. mozilla-bonobo + totem also works, but is unstable.
2004-09-27T05:01:00.000Z	sanxiyn		oops
2004-09-27T05:01:00.000Z	sanxiyn		it was to jsubl2.
2004-09-27T05:02:00.000Z	jsubl2	sanxiyn	did you apt-get it.  
2004-09-27T05:02:00.000Z	sanxiyn	jsubl2	http://packages.debian.org/unstable/gnome/mozilla-bonobo
2004-09-27T05:03:00.000Z	jsubl2		thanks
2004-09-27T05:03:00.000Z	sanxiyn		Eh, what really is the problem with getting mplayer in Debian?
2004-09-27T05:04:00.000Z	sanxiyn		http://packages.debian.org/unstable/misc/mozilla-mplayer is already officialy in Debian. :(
2004-09-27T05:07:00.000Z	jsubl2	sanxiyn	ok thanks.  so it is okay to get those few little things from debian unstable
2004-09-27T05:07:00.000Z	sanxiyn	jsubl2	I don't know.
2004-09-27T05:08:00.000Z	sanxiyn	jsubl2	I *think* mplayer and mozilla-mplayer may be okay. I am not very sure about mozilla-bonobo, considering Ubuntu is GNOME 2.8.
