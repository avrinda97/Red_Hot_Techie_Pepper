2006-07-14T05:22:00.000Z	ZeZu		just get acroreader
2006-07-14T05:22:00.000Z	ZeZu		the rest of them suck
2006-07-14T05:22:00.000Z	ZeZu		xpdf included
2006-07-14T05:22:00.000Z	ZeZu		says me
2006-07-14T05:22:00.000Z	ZeZu		who else would i be speaking for?
2006-07-14T05:23:00.000Z	ZeZu		doesn't handle all images and imbedded crap and it doesn't even bother to anti-alias
2006-07-14T05:23:00.000Z	ZeZu		acroreader isn't a commercial product, its freeware, and you are using a "commercial" format
2006-07-14T05:23:00.000Z	ZeZu		so yea
2006-07-14T05:23:00.000Z	ZeZu		if acrobat is commercial, thats another story
2006-07-14T05:24:00.000Z	void^	ZeZu	i've read many pdf ebooks and never felt a need for acroread. i conclude your statement is true only for specific pdfs, probably forms.
2006-07-14T05:24:00.000Z	ZeZu		actually, you obv dont seem to have a clue
2006-07-14T05:24:00.000Z	ZeZu		not OSS doesn't mean its commercial
2006-07-14T05:25:00.000Z	ZeZu		i release my own softare, its not open source, but its definitely not commercial
2006-07-14T05:25:00.000Z	ZeZu	void^	i didn't say every pdf
2006-07-14T05:25:00.000Z	void^	ZeZu	of course it's commercial. they release the reader for free to sell the authoring software.
2006-07-14T05:25:00.000Z	ZeZu		nothx
2006-07-14T05:25:00.000Z	ZeZu	void^	that doesn't make it commercial
2006-07-14T05:25:00.000Z	void^	ZeZu	right.. let's call it a day.
