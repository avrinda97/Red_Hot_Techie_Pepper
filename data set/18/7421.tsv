2008-01-11T16:24:00.000Z	Malinthe		what program should i use to capture tv programs? (i have a tv tuner and i watch tv programs with tvtime)
2008-01-11T16:25:00.000Z	cwillu	Malinthe	I'm fond of mythtv myself;  depending on the card, you can often just cp from /dev/video0 and get an mpeg file out of it
2008-01-11T16:25:00.000Z	Malinthe	cwillu	thnx
2008-01-11T16:26:00.000Z	cwillu	Malinthe	what tuner do you have?
2008-01-11T16:27:00.000Z	Malinthe	cwillu	it's sth called intex. has a philips SAA7130 tuner chip.
2008-01-11T16:27:00.000Z	cwillu	Malinthe	does it have an mpeg encoder on it do you know?
2008-01-11T16:28:00.000Z	cwillu	Malinthe	the thing I said about mpeg2 will only work if it does
2008-01-11T16:28:00.000Z	Malinthe	cwillu	i'm not sure
2008-01-11T16:28:00.000Z	cwillu	Malinthe	k;  I know mythtv will do live tv recording stuff (pause, rewind, etc)
2008-01-11T16:28:00.000Z	cwillu	Malinthe	it'll need a fairly beefy machine if the card doesn't do encoding onboard though
2008-01-11T16:29:00.000Z	Malinthe	cwillu	okay
2008-01-11T17:53:00.000Z	cwillu	Malinthe	I think it's nvidia-config
2008-01-11T17:54:00.000Z	Malinthe	cwillu	i checked there. clone mode is already enabled. but there's no fullscreen video overlay?
2008-01-11T17:54:00.000Z	cwillu	Malinthe	it should just work, assuming that you get any output on the tv at all
2008-01-11T17:55:00.000Z	Malinthe	cwillu	i get tv output. but when i maximize the video on my monitor, tv cuts the bottom and left. (due to the resolution difference)
2008-01-11T17:56:00.000Z	cwillu	Malinthe	okay, sounds like overscan issues
2008-01-11T18:05:00.000Z	cwillu	Malinthe	yes, it'd be kind to do that
2008-01-11T18:06:00.000Z	cwillu	Malinthe	did you get your tv issue sorted out?
