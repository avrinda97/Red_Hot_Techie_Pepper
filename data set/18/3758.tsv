2009-08-04T21:47:00.000Z	shawnps		I'd like to be able to VNC into an Ubuntu machine running 9.04 Server, but it doesn't seem to be working.  Do I need other things installed aside from vnc4server?
2009-08-04T21:48:00.000Z	joeyeye	shawnps	just use vino
2009-08-04T21:50:00.000Z	joeyeye	shawnps	vnc capability is installed out-of-the-box - go to System | Preferences | Remote Desktop
2009-08-04T21:50:00.000Z	shawnps	joeyeye	It's a server, no monitor
2009-08-04T21:51:00.000Z	joeyeye	shawnps	so no X ... isn't that why vnc will give black screen ... ?
2009-08-04T21:52:00.000Z	shawnps	joeyeye	I don't know, that's sort of why I'm asking
2009-08-04T21:52:00.000Z	shawnps	joeyeye	What do I need to install, then, for VNC to work?
2009-08-04T21:53:00.000Z	joeyeye	shawnps	do you want a desktop, or a SSH ?
2009-08-04T21:53:00.000Z	shawnps	joeyeye	I can already SSH, I want to be able to VNC into the server
2009-08-04T21:53:00.000Z	joeyeye	shawnps	then you'll need to install a window manager and X
2009-08-04T21:54:00.000Z	joeyeye	shawnps	i.e. gnome-desktop or something else
2009-08-04T21:54:00.000Z	shawnps	joeyeye	okay, do you know what the package for X is called?
2009-08-04T21:54:00.000Z	joeyeye	shawnps	gnome-desktop should pull everything down you need
2009-08-04T21:58:00.000Z	joeyeye	shawnps	what window manager do you want to use ?
2009-08-04T22:01:00.000Z	shawnps	joeyeye	I dunno, GNOME?
2009-08-04T22:01:00.000Z	shawnps	joeyeye	I think I got it working
2009-08-04T22:02:00.000Z	joeyeye	shawnps	take a look through here: http://www.arsgeek.com/2006/09/26/how-to-connect-to-your-headless-server-with-vncgui/
2009-08-04T22:04:00.000Z	shawnps	joeyeye	Okay, thanks
