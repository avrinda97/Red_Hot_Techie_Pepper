2011-03-14T07:58:00.000Z	Bruce_Wayne		Hey guys, is there any way to get rid of that "Unlock Keyring" password verification for allowing gwibber when we log in? Can we just set it default for our account?
2011-03-14T08:00:00.000Z	josh_	Bruce_Wayne	does it complain about 'the keyring not being unlocked when you log in'?
2011-03-14T08:00:00.000Z	josh_	Bruce_Wayne	or is it just a boilerplate err?
2011-03-14T08:02:00.000Z	josh_		mehbeh Bruce_Wayne had some crimefighting duties to attend to :(
2011-03-14T08:02:00.000Z	Bruce_Wayne	josh_	I'm sorry my friend for late reply
2011-03-14T08:03:00.000Z	Bruce_Wayne	josh_	I have kept "Automatic Log on" feature in ubuntu
2011-03-14T08:03:00.000Z	Bruce_Wayne		Josh_, and I'm using gwibber for social networking
2011-03-14T08:04:00.000Z	josh_	Bruce_Wayne	aah. The auto login is a slightly different thing; in that it should still unlock your keyring. You use gdm?
2011-03-14T08:05:00.000Z	josh_		(Bruce_Wayne: you prolly use gdm).
2011-03-14T08:05:00.000Z	Bruce_Wayne		Josh_, so when I log in in my account in ubuntu.. it asks me for "Unlock Keyring" password and when I type in my password, only after that gwibber is accessible.. It's not about not typing the password.. but it gets little annoying everytime
2011-03-14T08:05:00.000Z	Bruce_Wayne	josh_	what's gdm?
2011-03-14T08:06:00.000Z	josh_	Bruce_Wayne	gnome display manager, it starts up things (Your login prompt, if you had one ;] )
2011-03-14T08:08:00.000Z	Bruce_Wayne	josh_	I have no idea how it works or what's it.. :(
2011-03-14T08:08:00.000Z	josh_	Bruce_Wayne	not so sure about the why yet, so un momento
2011-03-14T08:12:00.000Z	josh_	Bruce_Wayne	so it appears it *does* have to deal with logging in automatically, as per http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1459804
2011-03-14T08:13:00.000Z	josh_	Bruce_Wayne	the last post, and the post on the next page detail it out. There's also a link to a bug report for a solution but I haven't read it yet...
2011-03-14T08:13:00.000Z	Bruce_Wayne	josh_	very nice of you .. thanks I will sure have a look at it
2011-03-14T08:13:00.000Z	josh_	Bruce_Wayne	no prob :)
