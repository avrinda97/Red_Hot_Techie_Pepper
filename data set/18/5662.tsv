2010-02-16T09:27:00.000Z	ronj		I'd like to bind certain home folders to specific folder icons (like Documents, Downloads, Music... by default). xdg-user-dirs is here for this and indeed I'm able to add entries to .config/user-dirs.dirs, but I'm unable to find how to specify icons. The freedesktop specification doesn't mention it and my attempts at digging how it was made by my icon theme were unsuccessful. any help?
2010-02-16T09:28:00.000Z	Nitsuga	ronj	The places icons are  in <icon folder>/places/<size>/
2010-02-16T09:29:00.000Z	Nitsuga	ronj	for example the humanity icons in 64x64px are in /usr/share/icons/Humanity/places/64
2010-02-16T09:30:00.000Z	ronj	Nitsuga	yes I found this, but suppose I declare a new XDG_APPLICATIONS_DIR="$HOME/Apps" in my .config/user-dirs.dirs . Where should I place this "applications" icon?
2010-02-16T09:31:00.000Z	ronj	Nitsuga	I tried following the naming structure, meaning creating a /usr/share/icons/gnome-wise/scalable/places/folder-applications.svg but it seems it's not enough
2010-02-16T09:36:00.000Z	ronj	Nitsuga	I wasn't successful at reading the famous source. maybe you'll be better than I was
2010-02-16T09:46:00.000Z	ronj	Nitsuga	found this http://osdir.com/ml/svn-commits-list/2009-06/msg03882.html which lists a fixed number of folders. I hope it's not hardcoded :-/
2010-02-16T09:48:00.000Z	Nitsuga	ronj	as I can see in  the.. Fantastic Source it IS hardcoded
2010-02-16T09:49:00.000Z	ronj	Nitsuga	in which package did you find this? xdg-user-dirs?
2010-02-16T09:49:00.000Z	ronj	Nitsuga	which file?
2010-02-16T09:50:00.000Z	ronj	Nitsuga	wooooow
2010-02-16T09:52:00.000Z	ronj	Nitsuga	my eyes are bleeding. I'll file and link GNOME/LP bug couple
2010-02-16T09:52:00.000Z	ronj	Nitsuga	thanks
2010-02-16T09:53:00.000Z	Nitsuga	ronj	as a workaround you may use XDG_DIR_PUBLICSHARE. I don't wind any use to that folder
2010-02-16T09:53:00.000Z	ronj	Nitsuga	yup, or do it manually like lakotajames suggested
2010-02-16T09:54:00.000Z	Nitsuga	ronj	but in my nautilus that option isn't present
2010-02-16T09:56:00.000Z	ronj	Nitsuga	yes it is. Right click on a folder > Properties > Click the icon
2010-02-16T09:57:00.000Z	Nitsuga	ronj	can't believe that i didn't see that
