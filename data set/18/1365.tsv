2012-08-22T14:34:00.000Z	mushin	bekks	natty
2012-08-22T14:34:00.000Z	bekks	mushin	You are on a virtual server, arent you?
2012-08-22T14:34:00.000Z	mushin	bekks	correct
2012-08-22T14:35:00.000Z	mushin	bekks	give it to me straight doctor :D
2012-08-22T14:36:00.000Z	bekks	mushin	you coulkd check packages.ubuntu.com so see wether that sudo change was an update.
2012-08-22T14:37:00.000Z	mushin	bekks	never done anything like that before - could you tell me how to go about it?
2012-08-22T14:38:00.000Z	bekks	mushin	There is a search form for files on that page. You could use it to search for /usr/bin/sudo and see when that file was last updated officially.
2012-08-22T14:39:00.000Z	mushin	bekks	thanks i'll check
2012-08-22T14:41:00.000Z	mushin	bekks	sry for stupid question, but will sudo be in natty-updates under the utilities category?
2012-08-22T14:42:00.000Z	bekks	mushin	When there have been updates for it, yes.
2012-08-22T14:43:00.000Z	mushin	bekks	found it, but i can't find a timestamp for last update http://packages.ubuntu.com/natty-updates/admin/sudo
2012-08-22T14:44:00.000Z	bekks	mushin	You could use the changelog on the right side.
2012-08-22T14:48:00.000Z	mushin	bekks	phew, the changlog timestamp corresponds with the log. do you know any other ways i can check for backdoors or other inconsistencies in the system? in any case thank you so much for the help :)
2012-08-22T14:51:00.000Z	bekks	mushin	You could use the package "chkrootkit" too.
2012-08-22T14:57:00.000Z	mushin	bekks	chkrootkit gives me nothing! thanks again
