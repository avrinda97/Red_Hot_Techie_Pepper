2010-01-01T05:09:00.000Z	blackest_knight	philabole	 how are you connected to your dsl connection wired or wireless
2010-01-01T05:09:00.000Z	philabole		blackest_Knight: wired
2010-01-01T05:10:00.000Z	blackest_knight	philabole	 do you know what chipset your ethernet card has
2010-01-01T05:11:00.000Z	philabole	blackest_knight	not really i just built this thing and....
2010-01-01T05:12:00.000Z	philabole	blackest_knight	argh.....
2010-01-01T05:12:00.000Z	blackest_knight	philabole	 generally wired connections tend to just work
2010-01-01T05:13:00.000Z	philabole	blackest_knight	yeah i've been using ubuntu for over a year and it always has just worked
2010-01-01T05:14:00.000Z	philabole	blackest_knight	with a new motherboard, do i need some drivers or something
2010-01-01T05:15:00.000Z	blackest_knight	philabole	 you need to find what chip it is and google it
2010-01-01T05:15:00.000Z	philabole		darkest_knight: ok
2010-01-01T05:16:00.000Z	blackest_knight	philabole	 did it work on the live cd ?
2010-01-01T05:17:00.000Z	philabole		darkest_knight: you know i didn't check, i just installed it
2010-01-01T05:17:00.000Z	philabole	blackest_knight	sorry bout the name thing
2010-01-01T05:18:00.000Z	blackest_knight	philabole	 it might be worth googling the motherboard and linux and see what comes up, pain but sometimes you get issues
2010-01-01T05:18:00.000Z	philabole	blackest_knight	thanks i'll do that
2010-01-01T05:19:00.000Z	blackest_knight	philabole	 if you get really stuck you can pick up network cards very cheaply or even go for wifi but its unusual to have one that doesnt work at all
2010-01-01T05:19:00.000Z	blackest_knight		what does ifconfig say ?
2010-01-01T05:20:00.000Z	philabole	blackest_knight	thank you sir
