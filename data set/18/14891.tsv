2005-05-31T16:20:00.000Z	L7		My sound in VLC doesn't work, and it doesn't work in TOTEM either, can anyone help me? ._.
2005-05-31T16:20:00.000Z	fazer	L7	Does sound work, period?
2005-05-31T16:21:00.000Z	fazer	L7	like, in Gnome, do you see the volume control?
2005-05-31T16:21:00.000Z	L7	fazer	it works in amaroK and so on, with mp3s and stuff like that
2005-05-31T16:22:00.000Z	fazer	L7	ah
2005-05-31T16:22:00.000Z	fazer	L7	do you know what you are using? Are you using ALSA or OSSD?
2005-05-31T16:22:00.000Z	L7	fazer	i have no idea :/
2005-05-31T16:23:00.000Z	fazer	L7	hmm, damn, I forgot how we find out.  I have had the same problem.
2005-05-31T16:23:00.000Z	fazer	L7	use mplayer
2005-05-31T16:23:00.000Z	fazer	L7	try mplayer instead of VLC, i know it kind of sucks becaise its much more limited but it still works.
2005-05-31T16:24:00.000Z	L7	fazer	ok :/.. I really like VLC but i don't remember how to fix it
2005-05-31T16:26:00.000Z	fazer	L7	go into preferences of your VLC, under Audio, click the Advanced tab and play without the output sound thing.
2005-05-31T16:26:00.000Z	fazer		Select ALSA, OSS, ESD and etc...and see if they all work.
2005-05-31T16:28:00.000Z	L7	fazer	none of them works :/
2005-05-31T16:28:00.000Z	fazer	L7	hmm, you might to get the various sound plugins installed. For me, to get sound working with VLC was a pain =(
2005-05-31T16:29:00.000Z	L7	fazer	ok :/.. i got it working yesterday, but i re-installed my ubuntu today and really can't remember how i did it, someone told me something about typing "pkill esd" but that command doesn't seem to work
2005-05-31T16:30:00.000Z	fazer	L7	try 'killall esd'
2005-05-31T16:31:00.000Z	L7	fazer	nothing happens :/
