2006-03-30T09:14:00.000Z	vars	nickrud	i think i did that... how do i tell what the permissions are ?
2006-03-30T09:14:00.000Z	nickrud	vars	ls -d /tmp
2006-03-30T09:15:00.000Z	nickrud	vars	er, ls -ld /tmp :)
2006-03-30T09:15:00.000Z	nickrud	vars	that's it
2006-03-30T09:16:00.000Z	nickrud	vars	it's the t at the end, that's the sticky. It allows only the owners of files in /tmp delete rights on their files, iirc
2006-03-30T09:20:00.000Z	nickrud	vars	close firefox and try sudo chown -R <you>:<you> .mozilla

2006-04-22T16:01:00.000Z	nickrud	vars	I just read a way to use wine & firefox to see flash 8 on http://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats
2006-04-22T16:06:00.000Z	vars	nickrud	i dind't see anything about wine on that link
2006-04-22T16:10:00.000Z	vars	nickrud	did you get flash 8 working?
2006-04-22T16:11:00.000Z	nickrud	vars	actually I'm messing around with it as we speak. My memory was defective, the page was talking about shockwave.
2006-04-22T16:25:00.000Z	nickrud	vars	you still about?
2006-04-22T16:25:00.000Z	vars	nickrud	yeah
2006-04-22T16:26:00.000Z	nickrud	vars	I did the wine/windows firefox install, went to the macromedia flash test site, and downloaded shockwave & flash there; both seem to work
2006-04-22T16:27:00.000Z	vars	nickrud	cool thanks
