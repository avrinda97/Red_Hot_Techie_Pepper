2007-09-09T10:04:00.000Z	VousDeux		hmmm...I guess I expected to hear some votes for reiserfs or something :)
2007-09-09T10:05:00.000Z	VousDeux		ahhh...I see
2007-09-09T10:06:00.000Z	VousDeux		wow...that doesn't sound good
2007-09-09T10:07:00.000Z	VousDeux		I've used ext3 in the past...thought it might be a good idea to hear more about other choices
2007-09-09T10:07:00.000Z	sauvin	VousDeux	I think most people use ext3 even if they're aware of other choices.
2007-09-09T10:08:00.000Z	VousDeux		doesn't sound like many votes to stray from tried-n-true
2007-09-09T10:09:00.000Z	sauvin		This is the point; ext3 IS tried, and it is very true. I love it.
2007-09-09T10:09:00.000Z	VousDeux	open-gl	nope
2007-09-09T10:10:00.000Z	VousDeux	open-gl	you would need to boot from the CD
2007-09-09T10:11:00.000Z	VousDeux	open-gl	I'm running from a live CD right now....you just need to make sure you system BIOS is set to boot from CD before local drive
2007-09-09T10:11:00.000Z	VousDeux	open-gl	yes, restart the computer
2007-09-09T10:12:00.000Z	VousDeux	open-gl	another option besides resetting the boot order in the BIOS would be if your system has a boot menu
2007-09-09T10:13:00.000Z	VousDeux	open-gl	like on a Dell, I believe you can hit F12 to get a boot menu
2007-09-09T10:13:00.000Z	VousDeux	open-gl	depends on your system
2007-09-09T10:13:00.000Z	VousDeux	open-gl	np, gl
2007-09-09T10:15:00.000Z	VousDeux		!partition
2007-09-09T10:17:00.000Z	VousDeux		it's been quite awhile since the last time I partitioned a disk for a fresh Linux install...I need to go figure out how many partions I need, and how big to make each one
2007-09-09T10:17:00.000Z	sauvin	VousDeux	I have one swap partition and one regular partition.
