2010-04-18T02:57:00.000Z	epaphus		hello guys.. today I cloned two hard disks with a ubuntu OS. The copy doesnt run because it boots into a grub command prompt..  what could have gone wrong?
2010-04-18T02:57:00.000Z	aperson	epaphus	you need to set the uuid in grub
2010-04-18T02:58:00.000Z	epaphus	aperson	how?
2010-04-18T02:58:00.000Z	aperson	epaphus	different hdd == different uuid to boot from
2010-04-18T02:58:00.000Z	aperson	epaphus	you could boot into a livecd and re-install grub on the one that won't boot
2010-04-18T02:59:00.000Z	aperson		it should auto-detect the drive and update it

2010-04-18T03:00:00.000Z	epaphus		in the live cd..i should choose repair a broken system.. ?
2010-04-18T03:01:00.000Z	aperson	epaphus	read: what I linked @ reinstall from livecd.  simple instructions are there

2010-04-18T03:03:00.000Z	epaphus	aperson	thanks
2010-04-18T03:03:00.000Z	aperson	epaphus	good luck
2010-04-18T03:04:00.000Z	epaphus	aperson	quick question.. once this is fixed... then I dont need to "fix it" every time i pop the HD on a different hardware right?
2010-04-18T03:04:00.000Z	epaphus		(the original copy does work on any hardware)
2010-04-18T03:04:00.000Z	aperson	epaphus	different hdd == different uuid to boot from
2010-04-18T03:05:00.000Z	aperson	epaphus	every time you change the hdd you boot from, you have to re-install grub
2010-04-18T03:05:00.000Z	epaphus		thanks
2010-04-18T03:05:00.000Z	aperson	epaphus	well, you technically don't need to re-install grub every time, you can just reconfigure it
