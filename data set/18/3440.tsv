2009-12-15T05:19:00.000Z	crc32		This is such a fail. BSD and every other Linux distro is getting along find with sysv inits but now ubuntu knows better.
2009-12-15T05:20:00.000Z	losha	crc32	I have to agree. Such hubris. And have you seen the mess masquerading as grub scripts?
2009-12-15T05:23:00.000Z	losha	crc32	supposedly you edit /etc/default/grub. I made one change and grub ignored it!
2009-12-15T05:24:00.000Z	losha	crc32	GRUB_TIMEOUT=5 in etc/default/grub. Back it up, grub2 is really fragile...
2009-12-15T05:26:00.000Z	losha	crc32	think how the newbies feel. It's enough to drive you to mint. I can't in all honesty recommend 9.10 for beginners any more
2009-12-15T05:27:00.000Z	losha	crc32	good for you, grasshopper. Teaches humility....
2009-12-15T05:33:00.000Z	losha	crc32	the 'never' hack?
2009-12-15T05:34:00.000Z	losha	crc32	a pox on all lazy programmers everywhere...
2009-12-15T05:35:00.000Z	losha	crc32	this actually worked for me: http://www.ubuntugeek.com/fix-for-all-pulseaudio-related-issues.html
2009-12-15T05:36:00.000Z	losha	crc32	just skip the bit where it uses a gnome sound app that doesn't exist on 9.10 :-)
2009-12-15T05:40:00.000Z	losha	crc32	No. Some people have opined that concentric is losing their touch....
2009-12-15T05:42:00.000Z	crc32	losha	I like concentric. I don't want to see linux fragment anyfurher. Fragmintaion is what killed Unix the first time around.
2009-12-15T05:43:00.000Z	losha	crc32	more linux distros than users, you mean?
2009-12-15T05:45:00.000Z	losha	crc32	are you old enough to remember Lucy & Ethel at the chocolate factory? That's concentric's time-based release strategy...
2009-12-15T05:46:00.000Z	crc32	losha	I think Distros should focus on develerving their flavor of package management rather then confusubg linux users hat come from differen't distros.
2009-12-15T05:53:00.000Z	losha	crc32	it's configurable (at least in gnome) but the developers know better than you....
2009-12-15T06:06:00.000Z	losha	crc32	it still does on Fedora...
2009-12-15T06:07:00.000Z	crc32	losha	and RHEL up to 5.
