2007-11-20T00:17:00.000Z	Exry		Hi! Who can help me with a wierd (for me) problem? Some processes dies suddenly (Eg Firefox, and I may not start it again...) And i can't uppgrade the system. The updater just dissapears or teh uppdationg screen went no text and hangs there for ever... :X Can't see theat something happens...
2007-11-20T00:18:00.000Z	usr13	Exry	You might want to do a memory test.
2007-11-20T00:19:00.000Z	Exry	usr13	 Ok... how, I haven't doen that in Linux...
2007-11-20T00:19:00.000Z	usr13	Exry	You can update the system from command line:  sudo apt-get update
2007-11-20T00:20:00.000Z	Exry	usr13	 Ok, I'll test that. But how can I close the little window with the chugging update? (Thats have hung?) I don't know what process that is ^
2007-11-20T00:22:00.000Z	usr13	Exry	I don't konw about "chugging update" but you could just restart the Xserver:  Ctrl-Alt-Backspace
2007-11-20T00:27:00.000Z	usr13	Exry	Actually, if it happens again, I think the process name is update-manager.desktop  You can porbably kill it with  sudo pkill update-manager.desktop
2007-11-20T00:28:00.000Z	Exry	usr13	Ok, it happens every time i thry to use it... But can you please write the update command again? I lost it due I used ctrl+alt+backspace
2007-11-20T00:29:00.000Z	usr13	Exry	I'm sorry, it's just update-manager  sudo pkill update-manager
2007-11-20T00:30:00.000Z	Exry	usr13	 I just ment that you said I should try to upgrade thou the terminal... I confuse my self.-.
2007-11-20T00:31:00.000Z	usr13	Exry	sudo apt-get upgrade  apt-get update-manager
2007-11-20T00:31:00.000Z	Exry	usr13	 Ok, thanks :)
2007-11-20T00:31:00.000Z	usr13	Exry	Or:  apt-get upgrade
2007-11-20T00:32:00.000Z	usr13	Exry	Is it a pretty primitave system? or...?
2007-11-20T00:33:00.000Z	Exry	usr13	In the terminal I got the error: Segmentation fault (core dumped) - My system, yeah its old and dumb. 512Mb of RAM and a 500Mhz Pentium 4 processor...
2007-11-20T00:33:00.000Z	Exry		Pentium 3 I ment >.<
2007-11-20T00:34:00.000Z	Exry	usr13	 tested again, and it didn't get that error... Wierd :/
2007-11-20T00:39:00.000Z	Exry	usr13	 Eh, it ended here instead; Preconfiguring packages ...
