2008-04-30T20:27:00.000Z	Domevlo	genii	I would, but I'm running Linux Mint (which is based on some of Ubuntu's packages) and don't want the world to break.  I just reinstalled because I was messing around trying to get the hardy packages
2008-05-22T09:00:00.000Z	genii	Domevlo	Perhaps lspci for the vendor/device code then google it with Ubuntu to see what driver may be needed
2008-05-22T09:01:00.000Z	Domevlo	genii	ok, thanks
2008-05-22T09:02:00.000Z	Domevlo	genii	would that be my "Multimedia audio controller" ?
2008-05-22T09:03:00.000Z	genii	Domevlo	Likely not. Look for a vendor code of 8086 (intel)
2008-05-22T09:04:00.000Z	Domevlo	genii	I'm sorry, i really don't know what you mean.  I did lspci | grep 8086 and it came up blank...
2008-05-22T09:06:00.000Z	genii	Domevlo	lspci -nn
2008-05-22T09:08:00.000Z	Domevlo	genii	do you want me to pastebin that?
2008-05-22T09:08:00.000Z	genii	Domevlo	Sure

2008-05-22T09:13:00.000Z	genii	Domevlo	Nothing there looks like it fits the bill of that ethernet adapter. Perhaps it's usb based?
2008-05-22T09:13:00.000Z	Domevlo	genii	usb based?  I don't understand what this has to do with my cdrom/dvd drive...
2008-05-22T09:15:00.000Z	genii	Domevlo	Crud. I have you confused with another --- [23:59] <Arrick> anyone that might be able to help me figure out what driver an IBM Thinkpad t60p with the Intel Pro 1000 Wireless card uses so i can run kismet with it?
2008-05-22T09:16:00.000Z	Domevlo	genii	lol, no problem.  I was getting very confused there for a second :)
2008-05-22T09:16:00.000Z	genii	Domevlo	Sorry, been a long day
2008-05-22T09:16:00.000Z	Domevlo	genii	i understand
