2009-08-10T19:30:00.000Z	neil_d		can you tell an interface to be promiscuous in the /etc/network/interface file?
2009-08-10T19:30:00.000Z	edbian	neil_d	As in slutty?
2009-08-10T19:31:00.000Z	neil_d	edbian	ha ha ha... no as in listen to everything.
2011-04-03T21:37:00.000Z	edbian	neil_d	You have the wrong locale set
2011-04-03T21:38:00.000Z	neil_d	edbian	the file /etc/timezone is correct!
2011-04-03T21:38:00.000Z	edbian	neil_d	Then your clock is wrong?  IDK haha
2011-04-03T21:39:00.000Z	edbian	neil_d	Knowing linux the human race is probably wrong about the time.
2011-04-03T21:39:00.000Z	neil_d	edbian	it is "Australia/Sydney"
2011-04-03T21:40:00.000Z	neil_d	edbian	some very strange here.... the 'date' command has it correct... the time shown by the calendar program has it wrong.
2011-04-03T21:41:00.000Z	edbian	neil_d	mmm.  I'm not sure.  Never dug into all that before
2011-04-03T21:41:00.000Z	edbian	neil_d	Change the time in the calendar app?
2011-04-03T21:45:00.000Z	neil_d	edbian	I think I know what it is... I haven't logged out since before the change... and the calendar hasn't noticed that the time change occured while it has been running...
2011-04-03T21:46:00.000Z	edbian	neil_d	log out and log back in?
2011-04-03T21:50:00.000Z	neil_d	edbian	now its showing the correct time... this seems wrong to me.
2011-04-03T21:50:00.000Z	edbian	neil_d	That you logged out / in?  Or that you changed it manually?
2011-04-03T21:53:00.000Z	neil_d	edbian	I couldn't change it manually without affect the time remembered by the computer... but needing to log out/in to get the calendar correct, after a daylight saving change doesn't seem like a bug to me.
2011-04-03T21:54:00.000Z	neil_d	edbian	s/doesn't/does/
2011-04-03T21:54:00.000Z	edbian	neil_d	It doesn't seem like a bug?  I think the opposite.  You should file a bug on launchpad
