2007-06-21T10:48:00.000Z	shiester_miester		oh, is undernet a .net or a .org? :/
2007-06-21T10:49:00.000Z	wols	shiester_miester	depends how muchforce you apply
2007-06-21T11:04:00.000Z	wols	shiester_miester	emman101 please take your discussion eslewhere. this is nothing to do with ubuntu support
2007-06-21T11:56:00.000Z	wols	shiester_miester	of course. it would drag in a lot of kde baggage but it would work
2007-06-29T13:34:00.000Z	wols	shiester_miester	dpkg -l | grep ntfs
2007-06-29T14:10:00.000Z	shiester_miester	wols	ease up a little on the OT, im not saying its ok to flood the channel with random crap but give people a bit of room to discuss things relevant to their problem
2007-06-29T14:10:00.000Z	wols	shiester_miester	he was answered that question already. no need to repeat it
2007-12-07T18:04:00.000Z	wols	shiester_miester	run the browser from an xterm, check for any messages in the xterm when you play flash with sound
2007-12-07T18:05:00.000Z	wols	shiester_miester	gnash is far from usable and flas from adobe is currently borked
2007-12-07T18:06:00.000Z	wols	shiester_miester	can't be downloaded cause md5 is wrong
2007-12-07T18:09:00.000Z	wols	shiester_miester	tar
2007-12-07T18:09:00.000Z	wols	shiester_miester	if you really must download it from there (which is bad)
2007-12-07T18:10:00.000Z	shiester_miester	wols	what would you recommend?
2007-12-07T18:11:00.000Z	wols	shiester_miester	checking postinst files for flashplayer-nonfree, however I dunno if you are able to correct the md5 problem there
2007-12-07T18:11:00.000Z	wols	shiester_miester	what exactly did you install?
2007-12-07T18:17:00.000Z	shiester_miester	wols	running the installer from the tar worked, but it still doesn't have any sound :(
2007-12-07T18:18:00.000Z	wols	shiester_miester	I told you what to look for
2007-12-07T18:19:00.000Z	shiester_miester	wols	strangely enough, no output in the terminal this time\
