2006-02-20T11:46:00.000Z	mabus06		I insalled a driver for my DWL-G520 rev b on windows in order to get it to work with airopeek, and it made my device not be able to start properly. Is this a hardware problem do you think, or could I use ubuntu to use my card to learn more about my wireless network by snorting traffic?
2006-02-20T11:46:00.000Z	KoruptidPryde	mabus06	i'd verify that the thing isn't broken first  ;)
2006-02-20T11:47:00.000Z	KoruptidPryde	mabus06	PCMCIA adapter?
2006-02-20T11:48:00.000Z	mabus06	KoruptidPryde	: PCI card, DWL-G520 rev b (a dlink)
2006-02-20T11:48:00.000Z	KoruptidPryde	mabus06	at console use lspci and make sure the device is listing
2006-02-20T11:48:00.000Z	mabus06	KoruptidPryde	I'm not on ubuntu right now but I know it works for browsing the web etc, that isn't the problem.
2006-02-20T11:54:00.000Z	KoruptidPryde	mabus06	what is the issue then?
2006-02-20T11:55:00.000Z	mabus06	KoruptidPryde	I want to be able to snort traffic from my router without connecting to it.
2006-02-20T11:56:00.000Z	KoruptidPryde	mabus06	have you verified that your card is supported to do that?..... (if you are using ndiswrappers than the odds are slim)
2006-02-20T11:58:00.000Z	mabus06	KoruptidPryde	Well there was a driver on the site designed exactly for my model card (including the rev B part, which apparently according to google throws people off) but as I said it made my card not work. This was for windows, though. How would I find out if the hardware is capable? It is a DWL-G520 Rev b
2006-02-20T11:59:00.000Z	KoruptidPryde		maddler: investigate what type of chipset it uses
2006-02-20T11:59:00.000Z	KoruptidPryde		if it uses atheros then you should be fine
2006-02-20T12:00:00.000Z	KoruptidPryde	mabus06	look on the manufacturers site for detailed specs and checkto see what chipset it uses
2006-02-20T12:00:00.000Z	mabus06	KoruptidPryde	It does use atheros
2006-02-20T12:01:00.000Z	mabus06		KoruptidPrydethat's the difference between rev a and b, b uses atheros... but the windows driver made my card unusable.. so do you know if I can find a driver for that card that wil llet me snort on ubuntu?
2006-02-20T12:01:00.000Z	KoruptidPryde	mabus06	then you should be able to do just about everything with it under linux
2006-02-20T12:01:00.000Z	KoruptidPryde	mabus06	i'd try a iwlist scan to verify your card is scanning and such properly
2006-02-20T12:02:00.000Z	mabus06	KoruptidPryde	Hold that thought, must reboot into ubuntu.
