2005-05-13T08:29:00.000Z	g14	warty	It is this thing called open source
2005-05-13T08:31:00.000Z	g14	warty	Imagine this... You have a guy that makes something small for himself. It works and he likes it. He releases it to everyone else for free with the source code
2005-05-13T08:31:00.000Z	g14	warty	Those people take the source code and make it better because they want to add features that they will use
2005-05-13T08:31:00.000Z	g14	warty	More and more people contribute until it is something great
2005-05-13T08:32:00.000Z	g14	warty	It gets so great that big corporations like IBM, CISCO, HP, Compaq, and others hire programmers to make it better full time
2005-05-13T08:32:00.000Z	g14	warty	That is why linux is free
2005-05-13T08:33:00.000Z	g14	warty	Download the ubuntu live cd and play with it
