2008-12-21T03:39:00.000Z	Taladan		I'm trying to find some accounting software that will run on Ubuntu/Kubuntu that can take the place of Quickbooks (or even read QB company files if possible)
2008-12-21T03:41:00.000Z	Taladan		here's the thing...I service a bunch of businesses that use Quickbooks, and quite a few of them have expressed interest in Linux since it doesn't have the virus/crash issues that windows has, but Quickbooks is always the killer to the discussion for them
2008-12-21T03:42:00.000Z	Taladan		I know you can serve quickbooks from linux, but that they don't currently have a linux client...I'm looking for something that can replace it.  I have a CPA set up to test any software that I can come up with for accounting
2008-12-21T03:42:00.000Z	Taladan		I haven't tried wine because most of the stuff I've done with wine on my own has proven it to be buggy and crashy at best.
2008-12-21T03:43:00.000Z	Taladan		and each of them uses quickbooks...but I'm sure they use it for different things.
2008-12-21T03:45:00.000Z	Taladan		Yeah, I guess what I'm looking for is general accounting software with double entry that is capable of doing the basic functionality that quickbooks serves...
2008-12-21T03:45:00.000Z	Taladan		CRMs?
2008-12-21T03:46:00.000Z	Taladan		hrm
2008-12-21T03:46:00.000Z	Taladan		I hadn't thought about that clearmoments
2008-12-21T03:46:00.000Z	Taladan		kk
2008-12-21T03:47:00.000Z	Scunizi	Taladan	this one to http://www.thelinuxnewb.com/2008/12/top-10-linux-financial-tools.html
2008-12-21T04:20:00.000Z	Scunizi	Taladan	vtiger? zimbra? Centric?
2008-12-21T04:20:00.000Z	Taladan	Scunizi	I'm focussed more on accounting than customer db stuff
2008-12-21T04:21:00.000Z	Scunizi	Taladan	and do you need it server based?
2008-12-21T04:22:00.000Z	Taladan	Scunizi	for some customers I do, others I don't
2008-12-21T04:23:00.000Z	Scunizi	Taladan	the link I provided before.. I thought I remembered one that was server based.. not sure if it was opensource or not.
2008-12-21T04:23:00.000Z	Scunizi	Taladan	good luck
2008-12-21T04:23:00.000Z	Taladan	Scunizi	yeah, that link was very helpful
