2009-05-03T02:45:00.000Z	jwf		if you want to be a computer nerd, learn both
2009-05-03T02:46:00.000Z	jwf		anyone get Miro to work in Jaunty? did it require any special magics?
2009-05-03T02:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jwf	 it works here
2009-05-03T02:47:00.000Z	jwf	Dr_Willis	just out of the box?
2009-05-03T02:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jwf	 i just apt-get installed'd it...and it works
2009-05-03T02:48:00.000Z	jwf	Dr_Willis	hmmm, it just dies silently, doesn't start. any idea how to start looking at what might be causing that? Running it with --debug isn't helpful
2009-05-03T02:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jwf	 rin it from a terminal.. it runs fine here  version --> Miro 2.0.3 (r9307)
2009-05-03T02:50:00.000Z	jwf	Dr_Willis	i do run it from term. it just doesn't print anything, doesn't do anything, returns me to command prompt. if I run it with --debug, it starts it in GDB, which tells me that the "Program exited normally."
2009-05-03T02:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jwf	 clean install here, and all i did was apt-get install miro, so not sure what to tell ya
2009-05-03T02:52:00.000Z	jwf	Dr_Willis	could you do me a favour? run miro with --debug from the command line and let me know if it shows you a bunch of gtcache.gettext warnings
2009-05-03T02:53:00.000Z	jwf	Dr_Willis	cause maybe they aren't warnings, but errors, and that's where to start looking
2009-05-03T02:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jwf	 http://pastebin.com/f5d43615c
2009-05-03T02:57:00.000Z	jwf	Dr_Willis	and did it start up just fine, then say "program exited normally" when you close the program?
2009-05-03T02:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jwf	 it ran find..  then i closed it
2009-05-03T02:58:00.000Z	jwf	Dr_Willis	cool man, thanks for your help. so it confirms my suspicions that the gettext messages are just warnings...but brings me no closer to figuring out what's going on...
2009-05-03T02:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	jwf	 try it as a new user?
2009-05-03T02:59:00.000Z	jwf	Dr_Willis	that's a great idea.
