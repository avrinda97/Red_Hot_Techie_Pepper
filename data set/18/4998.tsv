2010-10-08T11:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		!boot | Seito
2010-10-08T11:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		!startup | Seito
2010-10-08T11:23:00.000Z	Seito	ActionParsnip	doesn't help either
2010-10-08T11:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Seito	well, it does. You cancheck your startup scripts and items loading at login using those factoids
2010-10-08T11:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Seito	if you look in system -> prefs -> startup items ,is bluetooth listed there? If you install bum can you re-enable it there?
2010-10-08T11:25:00.000Z	Seito	ActionParsnip	there only blueman here
2010-10-08T11:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Seito	if you add the command in rc.local it can also be made to run there
2010-10-08T11:26:00.000Z	Seito	ActionParsnip	also tried with no luck. I added the command to rc.local like sudo service bluetooth start without any success after all
2010-10-08T11:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Seito	no need for sudo. Stuff in rc.local runs as root
2010-10-08T11:27:00.000Z	Seito	ActionParsnip	I even tried to reinstall those packages related to bluetooth (bluez, bluetooth, blueman) hoping that dpkg will recreate all needed configs
2010-10-08T11:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Seito	it also needs addingabove the exit 0 ,line
2010-10-08T11:27:00.000Z	Seito	ActionParsnip	yes, it's already there
2010-10-08T11:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Seito	?
2010-10-08T11:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Seito	i'd log a bug too
2010-10-08T11:28:00.000Z	Seito	ActionParsnip	can you tell me please how to log it?
2010-10-08T11:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Seito	ubuntu-bug bluetooth ,or whatever package you feel is affected
2010-10-08T11:30:00.000Z	Seito	ActionParsnip	also, can you tell me where to look for the log (if any) which bluetooth service writes?
2010-10-08T11:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Seito	/var/log would be my first place to look
