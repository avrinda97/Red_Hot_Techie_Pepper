2011-07-04T18:33:00.000Z	alphacat		i have a Mobile Intel(R) 915GM graphics chipset, can anyone please tell me if that's blacklisted/problematic, and may be causing syslinux to freeze at launch?
2011-07-04T18:33:00.000Z	ikonia	alphacat	very doubtful
2011-07-04T18:34:00.000Z	ikonia	alphacat	syslinux is dumb, if it's freezing it's possible that syslinux is not correct or a hardware problem
2011-07-04T18:34:00.000Z	alphacat	ikonia	does that mean i will never get ubuntu running on this machine then? i've tried 4 installation methods now
2011-07-04T18:34:00.000Z	ikonia	alphacat	what are you booting from
2011-07-04T18:35:00.000Z	alphacat	ikonia	cd, usb, and wubi all failed
2011-07-04T18:35:00.000Z	ikonia	alphacat	ok - so wubi isn't using syslinux, so it's doubtful syslinux is the problem
2011-07-04T18:35:00.000Z	alphacat	ikonia	wubi failed by telling me it couldn't grab the iso metalink
2011-07-04T18:35:00.000Z	ikonia	alphacat	ok - so that's not syslinux,
2011-07-04T18:36:00.000Z	alphacat	ikonia	i figured as much, is there any way to install without syslinux or wubi then
2011-07-04T18:36:00.000Z	ikonia	alphacat	what happens when you boot from a cd ?
2011-07-04T18:37:00.000Z	alphacat	ikonia	similar, get a 'isolinux' launch line and then additionally 'loading graphics..' or something along those lines and then freezes
2011-07-04T18:38:00.000Z	ikonia	alphacat	can you run the memtest option from the cd?
2011-07-04T18:39:00.000Z	alphacat	ikonia	i don't get to any options like that before it freezes
2011-07-04T18:41:00.000Z	ikonia	alphacat	can you boot anything, eg: a windows cd, a fedora CD
2011-07-04T18:41:00.000Z	alphacat	ikonia	i just installed xp from cd yesterday
2011-07-04T18:41:00.000Z	ikonia	alphacat	that is English
2011-07-04T18:44:00.000Z	alphacat	ikonia	English? what do you mean
