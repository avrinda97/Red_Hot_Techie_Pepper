2006-02-26T08:35:00.000Z	jbmagic		does ubuntu use debian?
2006-02-26T08:36:00.000Z	jbmagic		oh i see
2006-02-26T08:36:00.000Z	jbmagic		what easier guys to gentoo or Ubuntu?
2006-02-26T08:36:00.000Z	Madpilot	jbmagic	Ubuntu can be installed and running in about 30min - how long would a compile/install of Gentoo take?
2006-02-26T09:49:00.000Z	Madpilot	jbmagic	that'll be a pretty long list, there's thousands of apps available (not all installed by default, of course!)
2006-02-26T09:50:00.000Z	Madpilot	jbmagic	OpenOffice is default
2006-02-26T09:51:00.000Z	Madpilot	jbmagic	that depends on your own def'n of "junk apps"...
2006-02-26T09:52:00.000Z	Madpilot	jbmagic	the whole standard install of Ubuntu is ~1.8Gb, just so you know
2006-02-26T09:52:00.000Z	Madpilot	jbmagic	and that includes OpenOffice, Firefox, the GIMP, etc
2006-02-26T11:18:00.000Z	Madpilot	jbmagic	the server install of Ubuntu? It's got no graphical desktop, just the command line - for running web servers & such
2006-02-26T11:19:00.000Z	Madpilot	jbmagic	any website you look at is being "served" by a server - lots of them run Linux
2006-02-26T11:21:00.000Z	Madpilot	jbmagic	just do the default install, it'll give you a full desktop
2006-02-26T11:33:00.000Z	Madpilot	jbmagic	yes, or use Synaptic if you prefer a GUI
2006-02-26T11:35:00.000Z	Madpilot	jbmagic	for ripping audio, ubuntu has SoundJuicer installed by default, it works nicely
2006-02-26T11:58:00.000Z	Madpilot	jbmagic	October 2005 - next version is due out mid-April/06
2006-02-26T12:01:00.000Z	Madpilot	jbmagic	swap isn't really needed, depending on how much ram yo've got
2006-03-01T10:07:00.000Z	Madpilot	jbmagic	you can dist-upgrade fairly easily
2006-03-01T10:16:00.000Z	Madpilot	jbmagic	you'll need to set your router up right, if you've got one, but other than that svn isn't that hard
