2006-10-02T13:37:00.000Z	Avagant|Sleep		no i just typed that wrong, sorry jp.
2006-10-02T13:37:00.000Z	Avagant|Sleep		but yah so there's nothing i can do now?
2006-10-02T13:38:00.000Z	Avagant|Sleep		i spent way too long doing all this crap and now i have to reinstall.
2006-10-02T13:38:00.000Z	Avagant|Sleep		....i'm seriously going to lose it.
2006-10-02T13:39:00.000Z	Avagant|Sleep		that doesn't work.

2006-10-02T13:39:00.000Z	Avagant|Sleep		sorry jp
2006-10-02T13:40:00.000Z	Avagant|Sleep		see ya i put that in and it says it's not the right one.
2006-10-02T13:42:00.000Z	Avagant|Sleep		i can't even get into sudo
2006-10-02T13:43:00.000Z	aeroSoul	Avagant|Sleep	what do you mean with "get into sudo"? you mean change user to root?
2006-10-02T13:46:00.000Z	aeroSoul	Avagant|Sleep	you did chmod -R on /usr? :P
2006-10-02T13:54:00.000Z	aeroSoul	Avagant|Sleep	i think you have to go back into rescue mode and type chown root:root /usr/bin/sudo
2006-10-02T13:56:00.000Z	aeroSoul	Avagant|Sleep	i'd use the live cd... mount your root partition to some mountpoiunt and try to change ownership from there..
2006-10-02T13:56:00.000Z	aeroSoul	Avagant|Sleep	do you know on which partitoin your / is mounted?
2006-10-02T13:57:00.000Z	aeroSoul	Avagant|Sleep	skt is the wrong owner for sudo
2006-10-02T13:59:00.000Z	aeroSoul	Avagant|Sleep	how would you reinstall without root rights? :] 
2006-10-02T14:00:00.000Z	aeroSoul	Avagant|Sleep	use the live cd... and try to chown
