2005-12-17T07:34:00.000Z	bob2	CaptainMorgan	there's no need to try to sell yourself
2005-12-17T07:34:00.000Z	bob2	CaptainMorgan	apparently no one uses/cares about kwifimanager; perhaps try their channel or #kubuntu
2005-12-19T08:01:00.000Z	bob2	CaptainMorgan	those two concepts are unrelated
2005-12-19T08:02:00.000Z	bob2	CaptainMorgan	this is not windows; the file extension has no effect on whether something is runnable
2005-12-19T08:04:00.000Z	bob2	CaptainMorgan	you told it to touch *.c
2005-12-19T08:04:00.000Z	bob2	CaptainMorgan	data5 does not match *.c
2005-12-19T08:04:00.000Z	bob2	CaptainMorgan	you're confusing "filename" with "filetype"
2005-12-19T08:04:00.000Z	bob2	CaptainMorgan	C files should never ever be executable
2005-12-19T08:07:00.000Z	bob2	CaptainMorgan	that's not a "chmod option"
2005-12-19T08:07:00.000Z	bob2	CaptainMorgan	presumably it's a NTFS or FAT32 filesystem?
2005-12-19T08:08:00.000Z	bob2	CaptainMorgan	stop
2005-12-19T08:08:00.000Z	bob2	CaptainMorgan	why would you login as root?
2005-12-19T08:08:00.000Z	bob2	CaptainMorgan	/msg dpkg ntfs
2005-12-19T08:09:00.000Z	bob2	CaptainMorgan	let that script do it for you
2005-12-19T08:09:00.000Z	bob2	CaptainMorgan	it = setup fstab correctly
2005-12-19T08:15:00.000Z	bob2	CaptainMorgan	wiki.ubuntu.com/RootSudo
2005-12-19T08:16:00.000Z	bob2	CaptainMorgan	the ubuntu faq, the wiki and the installer explained it all to you
