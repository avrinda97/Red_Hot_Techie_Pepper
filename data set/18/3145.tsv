2010-06-17T00:55:00.000Z	Jigal		hello would like some help. Just did export path to java but now get error that path doesnt exist what can i do to solve the problem
2010-06-17T00:56:00.000Z	Jigal		get the error /bin/java  no such file or directory so how can i change it?
2010-06-17T00:58:00.000Z	geirha	Jigal	What command did you run to export that path exactly?
2010-06-17T00:58:00.000Z	Jigal	geirha	EXPORT
2010-06-17T00:59:00.000Z	geirha	Jigal	Of course, but what did you put after the export?
2010-06-17T01:00:00.000Z	Jigal	geirha	export JAVA_HOME=/usr/bin/java
2010-06-17T01:01:00.000Z	geirha	Jigal	Ah, that should probably be export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun
2010-06-17T01:01:00.000Z	Jigal	geirha	ok and how can i change that? do i just run the export comand again?
2010-06-17T01:01:00.000Z	geirha	Jigal	Yes. Why do you need to set JAVA_HOME btw?
2010-06-17T01:02:00.000Z	Jigal	geirha	because i need to instal cruisecontroll
2010-06-17T01:05:00.000Z	geirha	Jigal	Ok. Most apps will find in the standard location instead of requiring JAVA_HOME to be set, but some probably don't.
2010-06-17T01:05:00.000Z	Jigal		ok
2010-06-17T01:09:00.000Z	Jigal	geirha	when you change JAVA_HOME do you have to logof and login again
2010-06-17T01:10:00.000Z	geirha	Jigal	If you run it on the prompt, it will only affect that session
2010-06-17T01:10:00.000Z	geirha	Jigal	If you want it permanent, you need to put it in ~/.profile or ~/.pam_environment (in which case it will take effect next time you log in)

2010-06-17T01:11:00.000Z	Jigal	geirha	how to put it in profile? Just hardcoded in vi?
2010-06-17T01:13:00.000Z	geirha	Jigal	Yeah, you just add that line, export JAVA_... at the end of the file, and save
