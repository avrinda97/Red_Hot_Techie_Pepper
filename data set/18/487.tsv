2012-01-30T00:44:00.000Z	CAPITALISMUS	ActionParsnip	my linux box has lots of programs that connect to the network as root
2012-01-30T00:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	CAPITALISMUS	yes but its necessary for some. Irc doesnt need it plus its a bad idea
2012-01-30T00:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	CAPITALISMUS	things like updates will need the access as they are changing the OS in a big way
2012-01-30T00:49:00.000Z	CAPITALISMUS	ActionParsnip	i get it its for security reasons then
2012-01-30T00:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	CAPITALISMUS	also remember the target audience of ubuntu.
2012-01-30T00:51:00.000Z	CAPITALISMUS	ActionParsnip	what do you mean?
2012-01-30T00:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	CAPITALISMUS	ubuntu is aimed at new Linux users, so helping them form good habits is advantageous
2012-01-30T00:54:00.000Z	CAPITALISMUS	ActionParsnip	i thought ubuntu didnt had a target audience or was aimed at any one in particular
2012-01-30T00:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	CAPITALISMUS	all Linuxes have a goal or aim
2012-01-30T00:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	CAPITALISMUS	i don't think they have the ability although I've see ipad apps for cats
