2011-09-12T23:16:00.000Z	zelozelos		whats the command for starting a windows program thats not installed..via link   This isnt working   env WINEPREFIX="/home/zelo/.wine" wine C:\\windows\\command\\start.exe
2011-09-12T23:17:00.000Z	zelozelos		oops i mean this isnt working:    env WINEPREFIX="/home/zelo/.wine" wine C:\\windows\\command\\start.exe /home/zelo/Programs/RWCursorEditor/RWCursorEditor.exe
2011-09-12T23:19:00.000Z	Polah	zelozelos	Your last part should be "we /path/to/executable", you don't need C:/windows and so on before the path to the executable
2011-09-12T23:20:00.000Z	zelozelos	Polah	ah so it should beenv WINEPREFIX="/home/zelo/.wine" /home/zelo/Programs/RWCursorEditor/RWCursorEditor.exe   ?
2011-09-12T23:24:00.000Z	Polah	zelozelos	wine home/zelo/Programs/RWCursorEditor/RWCursorEditor.ex
2011-09-12T23:25:00.000Z	zelozelos	Polah	oh ok thank you again just wine and path/filename works ;)
2011-09-12T23:33:00.000Z	Polah	zelozelos	Are you making cursors for Linux using a Winodws program?
2011-09-12T23:34:00.000Z	zelozelos	Polah	no..well yeah but for both windows and linux, im using xcursorgen for the linux cursors
2011-09-12T23:34:00.000Z	zelozelos	Polah	do you know of a program for linux that has a gui?
2011-09-13T01:13:00.000Z	Polah	zelozelos	~/Desktop/0010.png  would replace /home/user part of the path
2011-09-13T01:14:00.000Z	zelozelos	Polah	well  that helps a little ;_) thankyou
2011-09-13T01:15:00.000Z	Polah	zelozelos	Or if you're doing multiple lines with the same thing in a single script, you could use variables to define it once them just replace the value with the variable later in the script.
2011-09-13T01:16:00.000Z	zelozelos	Polah	i guess ill try without the path and just the filename, its not a script persay its strictly formatted no extra spaces, entries, even blank lines or it wont read the config file correctly
2011-09-13T01:17:00.000Z	Polah	zelozelos	Can't put them in ""?
2011-09-13T01:18:00.000Z	zelozelos	Polah	i figured if it errors out on an extra space it prob wont take anything other then the specified line
2011-09-13T01:19:00.000Z	Polah	zelozelos	if you have a space in an unconfined string then it'll attempt to parse the values on either side of the space as two strings, if you put the entire string with spaces in "", '' or similar then it'll read it as a single string, or should do. Or you could try escaping your spaces by putting a \ before them, for example  /etc/file\ space/blah
2011-09-13T01:20:00.000Z	zelozelos	Polah	i wish i could write a script that would run xcursorgen, and allows for input for the numbered items to be entered in only once and would read the folder and make the config on the fly as it read each image in the folder varibles
2011-09-13T01:22:00.000Z	zelozelos	Polah	maybe i should do a psudo code for the logic and see what i can come up with...it would save a TON of work even for just one pointer theme
