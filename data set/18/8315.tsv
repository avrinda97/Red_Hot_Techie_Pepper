2007-10-05T09:10:00.000Z	dissection		Sorry, got disconnected. When I installed Ubuntu yesterday, I wanted to disable one of my partitions that contained only the Sony Vaio Recovery software and I chose "do not use". But after having installed Ubuntu, I saw that it disabled a different NTFS partition installed. How do I bring it back?
2007-10-05T09:11:00.000Z	danielax	dissection	there's probaly an easier way, but you could edit fstab
2007-10-05T09:12:00.000Z	dissection	danielax	How? I mean, where do I find fstab?
2007-10-05T09:12:00.000Z	danielax	dissection	/etc/fstab. If you're not familiar with it, I probably don't recommend it. 1 moment
2007-10-05T09:14:00.000Z	danielax	dissection	I'm sure that there's a graphical tool to do it... I just don't know what
2007-10-05T09:16:00.000Z	danielax	dissection	as root, edit /etc/fstab
2007-10-05T09:17:00.000Z	danielax	dissection	not just yet ;)
2007-10-05T09:23:00.000Z	danielax	dissection	you should just need to change the first column of the fstab entry for the windows entry
2007-10-05T09:27:00.000Z	danielax	dissection	its a bit hard to knwo without actually poking around at your computer physically
2007-10-05T09:27:00.000Z	danielax	dissection	I would suggest heading over to your local Linux Users Group.
2007-10-05T09:31:00.000Z	danielax	dissection	if you want to get the bot to talk to you only /msg ubotu !whatever
2007-10-05T09:41:00.000Z	danielax	dissection	no.
2007-10-05T09:43:00.000Z	danielax	dissection	nope. We can't really tell without seeing your computer - find a local linux users group
2007-10-05T10:39:00.000Z	danielax	dissection	first one thing then another :P
2007-10-05T10:39:00.000Z	dissection	danielax	Just can't get it right. Something has to go wrong always
2007-10-05T10:40:00.000Z	danielax	dissection	Mr. Murphy is having a field day on you computer :)
2007-10-05T10:41:00.000Z	dissection	danielax	Any idea how I can remove it from the desktop?
2007-10-05T10:42:00.000Z	danielax	dissection	umm... no. But your surely not the first. The fourms, or someone else may be able to help
