2011-03-29T00:14:00.000Z	rcmaehl	Somelauw	it shouldn't
2011-03-29T00:14:00.000Z	rcmaehl	Somelauw	what did you messup?
2011-03-29T00:15:00.000Z	rcmaehl	Somelauw	run free -m in terminal
2011-03-29T00:16:00.000Z	Somelauw	rcmaehl	Under section free: 3291 3667 4631.
2011-03-29T00:17:00.000Z	rcmaehl	Somelauw	how much ram do you have installed?
2011-03-29T00:18:00.000Z	Somelauw	rcmaehl	total ram is 3928. So it is 3260 / 3928?
2011-03-29T00:18:00.000Z	Somelauw	rcmaehl	I assume all that ram is installed. How can I check this.
2011-03-29T00:18:00.000Z	rcmaehl	Somelauw	lshw
2011-03-29T00:19:00.000Z	rcmaehl	Somelauw	sudo lshw
2011-03-29T00:19:00.000Z	Somelauw	rcmaehl	Should I pastebin all that info?
2011-03-29T00:19:00.000Z	rcmaehl	Somelauw	yes
2011-03-29T00:23:00.000Z	Somelauw	rcmaehl	http://pastebin.com/Ev2tywDS
2011-03-29T00:26:00.000Z	rcmaehl	Somelauw	hmm 4gb. Does memtest86+ say anything?
2011-03-29T00:27:00.000Z	Somelauw	rcmaehl	Then I would need to reboot.
2011-03-29T00:27:00.000Z	Somelauw	rcmaehl	I have never ran it before. Is it easy to use?
2011-03-29T00:30:00.000Z	Somelauw	rcmaehl	But free -m didn't show problems and lcwp didn't find errors either. How should memtest find problems?
2011-03-29T00:31:00.000Z	rcmaehl	Somelauw	checks you memory for errors, and if it's not your memory it most be that your HDD is failin
