2008-09-10T14:42:00.000Z	g33k_gir1	lmg	owh: I tried this on the command line using alsamixer as well
2008-09-10T14:43:00.000Z	lmg	g33k_gir1	I have such a HDA Intel beast too
2008-09-10T14:44:00.000Z	g33k_gir1	lmg	have you been able to get your mic working?
2008-09-10T14:45:00.000Z	lmg	g33k_gir1	certainly. though at the very moment I have 3 capture sources (webcam has a built in, tv-tuner) so I'm trying to figure which is the one..
2008-09-10T14:45:00.000Z	g33k_gir1	lmg	right... well, I only have the two sources, currently. front and back mic inputs. neither work
2008-09-10T14:46:00.000Z	lmg	g33k_gir1	run alsamixer -c 0 and switch to capture by pressing TAB
2008-09-10T14:46:00.000Z	g33k_gir1	lmg	ok
2008-09-10T14:47:00.000Z	lmg	g33k_gir1	to the very right you should have Input-Source selectors
2008-09-10T14:47:00.000Z	g33k_gir1	lmg	yep, I see em
2008-09-10T14:47:00.000Z	lmg	g33k_gir1	are those set to "mic" or "front-mic" respectively?
2008-09-10T14:47:00.000Z	g33k_gir1	lmg	yes
2008-09-10T14:48:00.000Z	lmg	g33k_gir1	and the sliders for the mics are well around 80% and _not_muted_ ? iirc that was my problem in the first place
2008-09-10T14:48:00.000Z	lmg	g33k_gir1	[M] to un/mute iirc
2008-09-10T14:48:00.000Z	g33k_gir1	lmg	they are all maxed and not muted
2008-09-10T14:49:00.000Z	lmg	g33k_gir1	hang on, I'll get a mic + some more coffee :)
2008-09-10T14:49:00.000Z	g33k_gir1	lmg	thanks, I really appreciate this
2008-09-10T14:50:00.000Z	g33k_gir1	lmg	it shouldn't be this hard :) I got it working on my other machine (although granted, that is running kde3, not 4)
2008-09-10T14:51:00.000Z	g33k_gir1	lmg	hang-on, brb
