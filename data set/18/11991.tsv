2006-07-21T05:40:00.000Z	Moof	stefg	yeah, no use for my problem. specifically, I cant' seem to get ubuntu to see my radi device during bootup
2006-07-21T05:41:00.000Z	stefg	Moof	hardware or software raid?
2006-07-21T05:41:00.000Z	Moof		this is software raid 5
2006-07-21T05:41:00.000Z	Moof		/dev/md0 doesnt' exist
2006-07-21T05:41:00.000Z	Moof		and is root for my setup
2006-07-21T05:42:00.000Z	stefg	Moof	that's always annoying... get non-raid /boot partition and save yourself trouble
2006-07-21T05:42:00.000Z	Moof		I have a non-raid /boot partition
2006-07-21T05:42:00.000Z	Moof		I've doen this by the book using the ubuntu installer
2006-07-21T05:44:00.000Z	Moof	stefg	is it possible that the standard udev doesn't load raid partitions? or that I don't have enough information in my /boot to create it?
2006-07-21T05:46:00.000Z	stefg	Moof	i'd check both scenarios... and make sure all raid partitions are of type 'FD'
2006-07-21T05:46:00.000Z	Moof		ok
2006-07-21T05:46:00.000Z	Moof		how does the ubuntu installer deal with RAID? am I looking at just md, or do I need to wrry abotu LVM too?
2006-07-21T05:47:00.000Z	stefg		!lvm
2006-07-21T05:47:00.000Z	Moof	stefg	I take it that I need ot think in terms of LVM, then
2006-07-21T05:48:00.000Z	Moof	stefg	thanks
2006-07-21T05:48:00.000Z	stefg	Moof	never bothered to install ubuntu directly to a raid array, so i don't know if raid in ubuntu implies the use of lvm
