2008-11-19T05:28:00.000Z	|seb|		how "downgrade" to open source video driver?
2008-11-19T05:28:00.000Z	|seb|		I don't know how to change xorg.conf
2008-11-19T05:29:00.000Z	gravemind	|seb|	use the hardware manager to deactivate the restricted driver I think
2008-11-19T05:29:00.000Z	|seb|	gravemind	thanks..is that the same as System-Preferences-Hardware Drivers?
2008-11-19T05:30:00.000Z	gravemind	|seb|	yes, but it's under administration
2008-11-19T05:32:00.000Z	|seb|	gravemind	there is only a choice to "Activate" it..not "Deactivate"
2008-11-19T05:32:00.000Z	gravemind	|seb|	hmm -- you just want to use the nv driver, not nvidia?
2008-11-19T05:45:00.000Z	|seb|	gravemind	no
2008-11-19T05:43:00.000Z	|seb|	gravemind	actually fglrx (ATI) i suspect is causing X to freeze...so i'm hoping open source driver will avoid that
2008-11-19T05:44:00.000Z	gravemind	|seb|	ah ok. I've only done it with nvidia cards, but I assume you just want to edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf, find where it says "driver: xxxxxxx" and replace it with the name of the open source driver
2008-11-19T05:44:00.000Z	|seb|	gravemind	the reason i just now took so long to respond is because my damn X froze! :)
2008-11-19T05:45:00.000Z	gravemind	|seb|	ooh, unfortunate. Do you know about ctrl-alt-backspace?
2008-11-19T05:46:00.000Z	gravemind	|seb|	use that to restart X if it freezes
2008-11-19T05:46:00.000Z	gravemind	|seb|	you can also access a terminal at any time by holding ctrl, alt, and any key F1 through F6
2008-11-19T05:47:00.000Z	|seb|	gravemind	yes...it appears the freezing knocks out the keyboard so can't get to those terminals
2008-11-19T05:48:00.000Z	|seb|	gravemind	sometimes mouse still works...sometimes no
2008-11-19T05:48:00.000Z	gravemind	|seb|	wow those must be some serious xorg problems then
2008-11-19T05:48:00.000Z	gravemind	|seb|	might be another problem entirely, idk
