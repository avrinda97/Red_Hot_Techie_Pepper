2009-12-17T00:25:00.000Z	epaphus		Hello,l when encrypting the laptop with "use entire disk and set up encrypted LVM" How strong is this encryption?
2009-12-17T00:26:00.000Z	mod3st	epaphus	AES afaik
2009-12-17T00:26:00.000Z	epaphus	mod3st	where can i know for sure?
2009-12-17T00:27:00.000Z	mod3st	epaphus	Someone else should take this if you're using the installer.  The manual setup instructions here give more detail on the possible ciphers:  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EncryptedFilesystemLVMHowto
2009-12-17T00:29:00.000Z	mod3st		Is there any way to treat *multiple files* as a single block device when doing a loopback mount?
2009-12-17T00:30:00.000Z	mod3st		e.g. I have  /mnt/disk1/dd_image.1  and  /mnt/disk2/dd_image.2    and I want to mount dd_image.* as a loopback block device
2009-12-17T00:31:00.000Z	epaphus	mod3st	hmm that link describes the encryption done with cryptsetup. I need to know how strong is the ubuntu encryption.. i think its 256? or 128?
2009-12-17T00:31:00.000Z	mod3st	epaphus	Right, the installer should do it that way, just without showing you :)  I'm not an expert, but I would be very surprised if it weren't AES-128
2009-12-17T00:32:00.000Z	mod3st		(not an expert on ubuntu's installer; i'm pretty well-versed in crypto)
2009-12-17T00:32:00.000Z	epaphus	mod3st	is 128 better then 256 ?
2009-12-17T00:33:00.000Z	mod3st	epaphus	AES-128 is much faster than AES-256.  AES-256 is more secure, but it's not necessary to have that strong
2009-12-17T00:33:00.000Z	mod3st		really, 256 is overkill
2009-12-17T00:33:00.000Z	mod3st		no matter *what* you're doing on there :)
2009-12-17T00:33:00.000Z	epaphus		I need to encrypt it using AES 258. not 128
2009-12-17T00:33:00.000Z	epaphus		:(
2009-12-17T00:34:00.000Z	mod3st	epaphus	You can, you just have to manually set up using the instructions provided.  AFAIK, the installer won't let you choose.  Is there a reason why you need AES-256?
2009-12-17T00:34:00.000Z	epaphus	mod3st	according to this http://www.cjlinux.com/system/installation/how-to-install-ubuntu-with-an-encrypted-file-system.html  it is 256 AES
2009-12-17T00:35:00.000Z	mod3st	epaphus	So I'm wrong!  Thanks for double-checking.
