2012-05-20T03:45:00.000Z	chip8874		Not sure if im inturrupting anything, but may I ask a question?
2012-05-20T03:47:00.000Z	chip8874		so I have a fresh rig constructed. Im booting from a USB, but when I select either run from USB or install from USB, the screen flashes orange and white stripes and the signal to the monitor is lost. Either option does the same thing
2012-05-20T03:47:00.000Z	ellis	chip8874	what graphics adapter are you using?
2012-05-20T03:49:00.000Z	ellis	chip8874	have you tried booting a live disk?
2012-05-20T03:50:00.000Z	ellis	chip8874	it should be identical. If it boots fine of a CD then it's a problem with your USB
2012-05-20T03:52:00.000Z	ellis	chip8874	yes try fedora. It sounds like the may be compatability issues with your graphics hardware
2012-05-20T03:56:00.000Z	ellis	chip8874	Just type the name followed by a colon. That makes it obvious who the post is aimed at. As far as the screen problem, does your monitor say that it has lost signal, or does the screen just go blank?
2012-05-20T03:59:00.000Z	chip8874	ellis	I ran it again and it said "failed to initiate MSI-X" (keep in mind that this is fedora). After the orange and white junk, my monitor behaves as if it cannot detect a signal. It says each input in the upper right, then the power light goes yellow, so it seems like it lost signal
2012-05-20T04:01:00.000Z	ellis	chip8874	that's strange. Your best bet is reading into MSI-X. It's pretty low level stuff, my guess is that the kernel either doesn't support your GPU, or the necessary modules aren't loaded
2012-05-20T04:03:00.000Z	ellis	chip8874	have you had other operating systems working on the computer, like Windows?
2012-05-20T04:03:00.000Z	ellis	chip8874	It could be a hardware fault then with the GPU. It's hard to say
2012-05-20T04:04:00.000Z	ellis	chip8874	without trying a non-Linux-kernel operating system, you can't rule out the possibility that the hardware isn't faulty
2012-05-20T04:06:00.000Z	chip8874	ellis	Right. Are there any ways of testing this?
2012-05-20T04:06:00.000Z	ellis	chip8874	I would bet money that your computer would boot into a non-graphical OS fine. Download Arch Linux and boot that
2012-05-20T04:06:00.000Z	ellis	chip8874	If it boots Arch Linux fine, then it's definitely a graphics problem (hardware or software)
2012-05-20T04:07:00.000Z	chip8874	ellis	I will try this and see what happens
2012-05-20T04:07:00.000Z	ellis	chip8874	yes go with L3top suggestion
