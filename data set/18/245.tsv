2012-09-04T03:41:00.000Z	carter		can someone help i have had this version of linux before and i could download google chrome but it says its not in the app store why?
2012-09-04T03:41:00.000Z	WarOfTheNerd	carter	because it doesn't conform to package guidelines
2012-09-04T03:41:00.000Z	WarOfTheNerd	carter	you can download it and install it from Google
2012-09-04T03:41:00.000Z	WarOfTheNerd	carter	it integrates with the store after you've downloaded it from Google too
2012-09-04T03:42:00.000Z	WarOfTheNerd	carter	there's kinda no need
2012-09-04T03:43:00.000Z	WarOfTheNerd	carter	you do know that Chromium is the open source project Google Chrome is based on right?
2012-09-04T03:43:00.000Z	WarOfTheNerd	carter	if you install Chromium, you have Chrome without the proprietary bits
2012-09-04T03:43:00.000Z	WarOfTheNerd	carter	it's there on my search results.  What version of Ubuntu are you using? :|
2012-09-04T03:44:00.000Z	WarOfTheNerd	carter	you need to install a newer version
2012-09-04T03:44:00.000Z	WarOfTheNerd	carter	that version is past End of Life
2012-09-04T03:45:00.000Z	WarOfTheNerd	carter	8.04 doesn't get patches/updates or support for desktop use any more, you need to update to 10.04
2012-09-04T03:45:00.000Z	WarOfTheNerd	carter	that may explain the lack of a search result
2012-09-04T03:46:00.000Z	WarOfTheNerd	carter	12.04 is the newest version
2012-09-04T03:46:00.000Z	WarOfTheNerd	carter	the version numbers are based on the year and month of release by the way :)
2012-09-04T03:47:00.000Z	WarOfTheNerd	carter	technically yes, but I don't recommend it
2012-09-04T03:47:00.000Z	WarOfTheNerd	carter	if you're gonna change version, just grab 12.04.  It has 5 years of support lifetime :D
2012-09-04T03:48:00.000Z	WarOfTheNerd	carter	it won't need an upgrade until April 2017 if you use 12.04 ;)
2012-09-04T03:48:00.000Z	WarOfTheNerd	carter	of course
