2006-06-12T13:03:00.000Z	Tobberoth		Some help with compiling please?
2006-06-12T13:05:00.000Z	Tobberoth		Don't tell me I have to go to #gentoo to get help about compiling ;)
2006-06-12T13:05:00.000Z	Tobberoth		I don't know about that.. I've had and still have tons of problems with ubuntu
2006-06-12T13:07:00.000Z	Tobberoth		Please help. I'm trying to compile MPlayer, but when I use ./configure in the folder it tells me my GCC version is bad.
2006-06-12T13:07:00.000Z	Tobberoth		Yeah, just gdm
2006-06-12T13:07:00.000Z	Tobberoth		starts gnome
2006-06-12T13:09:00.000Z	Tobberoth		Won't that mess upp my current GCC?
2006-06-12T13:09:00.000Z	Tobberoth		Allright, I'll try then
2006-06-12T13:11:00.000Z	Tobberoth		I installed gcc 3.4, but it still says "not found"
2006-06-12T13:12:00.000Z	Tobberoth		Do I need to reboot for ./configure to notice my extra GCC version??
2006-06-12T13:13:00.000Z	Seveas	Tobberoth	no
2006-06-15T06:28:00.000Z	Seveas	Tobberoth	ehrm... amarok == amarok
2006-06-15T06:28:00.000Z	Tobberoth	Seveas	Maybe so, but I can't find 1.4 for GNOME.. Ubuntu has 1.3 in the repositories
2006-06-15T06:28:00.000Z	Seveas	Tobberoth	then 1.4 simply was released too late to be included
2006-06-15T06:29:00.000Z	Seveas	Tobberoth	why not?
2006-06-15T06:30:00.000Z	Seveas	Tobberoth	that with keys is simple
2006-06-15T06:32:00.000Z	Seveas	Tobberoth	the key ID in the case of ubuntu is DD4D5088
2006-06-15T06:38:00.000Z	Seveas	Tobberoth	english please
