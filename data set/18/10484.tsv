2007-01-01T10:36:00.000Z	MasterShrek	sc4ttrbrain	is it mounted when youre trying to resize it?
2007-01-01T10:37:00.000Z	sc4ttrbrain	MasterShrek	yes,thats why i cant resize it
2007-01-01T10:37:00.000Z	MasterShrek	sc4ttrbrain	do you have a copy of knoppix?
2007-01-01T10:37:00.000Z	sc4ttrbrain	MasterShrek	i ve live cds but no knoppix
2007-01-01T10:37:00.000Z	MasterShrek	sc4ttrbrain	any live cd with gparted on it?
2007-01-01T10:38:00.000Z	sc4ttrbrain	MasterShrek	ubuntu and kubuntu cd only
2007-01-01T10:38:00.000Z	MasterShrek	sc4ttrbrain	i would reccomment getting knoppix, its a very handy distro
2007-01-01T10:39:00.000Z	sc4ttrbrain	MasterShrek	ahy can i do  it within ubuntu
2007-01-01T10:39:00.000Z	sc4ttrbrain	MasterShrek	*why
2007-01-01T10:39:00.000Z	MasterShrek	sc4ttrbrain	no, u cannot resize a mounted partition, but to have your root partition not mounted you need to be booting off a cd, knoppix im sure has a partition editor, and im sure that ubuntu doesnt
2007-01-01T10:40:00.000Z	sc4ttrbrain	MasterShrek	so i can only do it from live cd?
2007-01-01T10:42:00.000Z	sc4ttrbrain	MasterShrek	cant i use fdisk?
2007-01-01T10:43:00.000Z	MasterShrek	sc4ttrbrain	maybe, can u resize using fdisk, ive never done it
2007-01-01T10:43:00.000Z	MasterShrek	sc4ttrbrain	if u can, then yes, but u just have to boot the live cd so your partition isnt mounted
