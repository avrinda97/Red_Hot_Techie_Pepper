2008-10-17T00:11:00.000Z	Stormx2	jharkn	man?
2008-10-17T00:11:00.000Z	Stormx2	jharkn	well, it tells you what commands do. Isn't that what you want?
2008-10-17T00:11:00.000Z	jharkn	Stormx2	nah, I was looking for an actual english dictionary
2008-10-17T00:12:00.000Z	Stormx2	jharkn	book store?
2008-10-17T00:13:00.000Z	jharkn	Stormx2	just not a sexy as a cl dictionary, heh
2008-10-17T00:13:00.000Z	Stormx2	jharkn	what is your idea of a "dictionary". A dictionary defines words or phrases. If you want to look up what a command does, you can check it's man page, or pass it --help/-h
2008-10-17T00:14:00.000Z	jharkn	Stormx2	when I say 'cl dictionary' I just mean a normal dictionary accessible from the command line rather than a gui app, rather than a dictionary /of/ the cl :)
2008-10-17T00:15:00.000Z	Stormx2	jharkn	so, man?
2008-10-17T00:15:00.000Z	jharkn	Stormx2	so man defines english words?!
2008-10-17T00:15:00.000Z	Stormx2	jharkn	oh oh oh! Sorry, I misunderstood
2008-10-17T00:15:00.000Z	Stormx2	jharkn	one moment, I'll have a look
2008-10-17T00:16:00.000Z	jharkn	Stormx2	s'alright! ty :)
2008-10-17T00:17:00.000Z	Stormx2	jharkn	what about just "dict"?
