2008-06-03T19:31:00.000Z	benny269		can someone help me configure rythmbox radio. keeps telling me im missing a decoder but i dont know which codecs to install?
2008-06-03T19:31:00.000Z	mgolisch	benny269	why not install all?
2008-06-03T19:32:00.000Z	benny269	mgolisch	how do i do that?
2008-06-03T19:32:00.000Z	mgolisch	benny269	in synaptic install all gstreamer plugins
2008-06-03T19:32:00.000Z	benny269	mgolisch	can you give me the command line for terminal?
2008-06-03T19:33:00.000Z	benny269	mgolisch	so search for gstreamer in synaptic and install ALL results?
2008-06-03T19:34:00.000Z	benny269	mgolisch	srry back, what did you say?
2008-06-03T19:34:00.000Z	mgolisch	benny269	yeah basicaly just install all gstreamer plugins
2008-06-03T19:36:00.000Z	benny269	mgolisch	is there a quicker way than just going through and marking each one individually?
2008-06-03T19:37:00.000Z	mgolisch	benny269	no idea, its just 5 or 6 is it realy that hard?
2008-06-03T19:38:00.000Z	benny269	mgolisch	there's quite a lot more than that. am i installing specifically the ones that have the words gstreamer and plugin in the title, or ALL the search results for gstreamer? i'm sorry if that's stupid Q but you're going to have to be specific, i'm new to this
2008-06-03T19:40:00.000Z	mgolisch	benny269	you just start synaptic and and start typing gstreamer it should jump tp the first package with that in its name
2008-06-03T19:42:00.000Z	benny269	mgolisch	oh i see you mean the add/remove i was in package manager, ok but i've checked there and i've installed all the gstreamer plugins that come up
2008-06-03T19:43:00.000Z	mgolisch	benny269	if they are all installed it should work, or there is just not gstreamer plugin for that type of audio data, in which case you should try using something else which doesnt depend on gstreamer
2008-06-03T19:44:00.000Z	benny269	mgolisch	do you mean use another program? is there no way of making rhythmbox radio work? could it be that i have not given the correct URL?
2008-06-03T19:45:00.000Z	benny269	mgolisch	no, what else can i use?
2008-06-03T19:45:00.000Z	benny269	mgolisch	maybe you could suggest a URL that's known to work"?
2008-06-03T19:45:00.000Z	mgolisch	benny269	i do not listen to webradio
