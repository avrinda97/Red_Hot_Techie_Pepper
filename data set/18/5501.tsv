2008-10-13T18:11:00.000Z	jrib	sqawarlz	what firewall?
2008-10-13T18:12:00.000Z	sqawarlz	jrib	guarddog. I have to run the cmds list http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/linux-iptables-how-to-flush-all-rules.html to get rid of the tables and allow traffic in and out but after a reboot they come back.
2008-10-13T18:12:00.000Z	sqawarlz	jrib	I did remove guarddog completely however.
2008-10-13T18:12:00.000Z	jrib	sqawarlz	did you try purging the package?
2008-10-13T18:12:00.000Z	sqawarlz	jrib	how do I do that? I normally add/remove through synapse
2008-10-13T18:13:00.000Z	jrib	sqawarlz	yeah, it's "completely remove" I believe instead of just "remove".  Is that what you did?
2008-10-13T18:13:00.000Z	sqawarlz	jrib	no I did completely but it did install a bunch of libraries needed to run on my system and maybe I missed a few of those?
2008-10-13T18:14:00.000Z	sqawarlz	jrib	cant I apt -get remove guarddog or something to get rid of it completely?
2008-10-13T18:14:00.000Z	jrib	sqawarlz	I don't think the libraries would matter.  aptitude purge guarddog
2008-10-13T18:14:00.000Z	sqawarlz	jrib	ok let me try that
2008-10-13T18:26:00.000Z	sqawarlz	jrib	looks like I missed a peice of the firewall. A complete removal worked. Thanks.
2008-10-13T18:26:00.000Z	jrib	sqawarlz	no problem
2008-10-13T18:27:00.000Z	sqawarlz	jrib	I have some questions about Ubuntu IPtables. How knowledgable are you of iptables and firewalls?
2008-10-13T18:27:00.000Z	jrib	sqawarlz	I don't know much more than what is on that wiki page.  just ask the channel and I'll help if I can
