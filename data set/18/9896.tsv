2007-02-05T14:39:00.000Z	genii	FuzZy2007	Is that a dual-core cpu?
2007-02-05T14:44:00.000Z	genii	FuzZy2007	Ah, you may need some special kernel options if it is a dual-core then. like noacpi ond one other which I need to look up
2007-02-05T14:50:00.000Z	genii	FuzZy2007	Do you know how to enter the grub prompt during boot?
2007-02-05T14:52:00.000Z	genii	FuzZy2007	OK, so go into the grub prompt before it starts booting. There it gives some options to edit the boot parameters. Find the default one, and add to the options:  notls noacpi    then boot with those options. If it works, put those options into the file /boot/grub/menu.lst
2007-02-05T14:53:00.000Z	genii	FuzZy2007	With dual-core cpus the notls is to make sure one cpu doesn't race, it gets stuck at 100% while the other is not used sometimes.
2007-02-05T14:57:00.000Z	FuzZy2007	genii	how do i solve that weird looking boot splash?
2007-02-05T14:58:00.000Z	genii	FuzZy2007	Sorry, didn't see that issue... the splash screen is messed up or something?
2007-02-05T15:05:00.000Z	genii	FuzZy2007	Hi. Did it get you up and running?
2007-02-05T15:08:00.000Z	genii	FuzZy2007	I think you need to reinstall
2007-02-05T15:08:00.000Z	genii	FuzZy2007	What dist are you trying to put on?
2007-02-05T15:11:00.000Z	genii	FuzZy2007	You may want to try the alternate install CD, do a basic command-line install then after do something like apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
2007-02-05T15:15:00.000Z	FuzZy2007	genii	will dual core support be added in feisty fey?
2007-02-05T15:16:00.000Z	genii	FuzZy2007	There is dual cpu support already by default by way of the SMP kernel. But specifically dual-core cpus have an issue on first install. after install they work fine
