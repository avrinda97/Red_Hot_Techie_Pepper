2006-12-27T08:56:00.000Z	DENYeitan0o9		what text editors does ubuntu come with?
2006-12-27T08:56:00.000Z	rukuartic	DENYeitan0o9	It also should come with "nano", which is easier to run for some people.
2006-12-27T09:01:00.000Z	rukuartic	DENYeitan0o9	Remove Read Only, or save as a different file.
2006-12-27T09:02:00.000Z	rukuartic	DENYeitan0o9	chmod u+w (filename)
2006-12-27T09:02:00.000Z	rukuartic	DENYeitan0o9	Do you understand Linux File permissions?
2006-12-27T09:07:00.000Z	rukuartic	DENYeitan0o9	Oh, you don't want to change those permissions.
2006-12-27T09:07:00.000Z	rukuartic	DENYeitan0o9	You need to edit it as root. Try this... "sudo nano /etc/passwd"
2006-12-27T09:40:00.000Z	rukuartic	DENYeitan0o9	Mmm, not sure. Lemme look.
2006-12-27T09:41:00.000Z	rukuartic	DENYeitan0o9	What I can suggest, is adding a line to /etc/sudoers that will give the user permission to use /usr/sbin/synaptic
2006-12-27T09:42:00.000Z	rukuartic	DENYeitan0o9	Wait, for another user, or the first one you created?
2006-12-27T09:44:00.000Z	rukuartic	DENYeitan0o9	What happens when you try to add/remove programs?
2006-12-27T09:45:00.000Z	rukuartic	DENYeitan0o9	Open up a terminal and type "sudo -i" and see if you can login as root.
2006-12-27T09:46:00.000Z	rukuartic	DENYeitan0o9	You should see "root@place:~#"... do you see that?
2006-12-27T09:47:00.000Z	rukuartic	DENYeitan0o9	What happens when you type "sudo -i" in the terminal?
2006-12-27T09:47:00.000Z	rukuartic	DENYeitan0o9	Type in your password.
2006-12-27T09:48:00.000Z	rukuartic	DENYeitan0o9	And it failed?
2006-12-27T09:49:00.000Z	rukuartic	DENYeitan0o9	Ok so you're logged in as root now?
2006-12-27T09:50:00.000Z	rukuartic	DENYeitan0o9	You might have messed up /etc/sudoers... were you editing that file at all?
