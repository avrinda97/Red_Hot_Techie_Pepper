2011-10-22T15:09:00.000Z	jiltdil	auronandace	Thanks anyway :)
2011-10-26T21:12:00.000Z	auronandace	jiltdil	you really should do that outside a channel (change your password too)
2012-01-07T14:15:00.000Z	auronandace	jiltdil	define better, i like wesnoth (different genre to a fps)
2012-01-07T14:16:00.000Z	jiltdil	auronandace	 is wesnoth like nexuz , means quality game, i want some fighting one
2012-01-07T14:16:00.000Z	auronandace	jiltdil	no, its a turnbased strategy
2012-01-07T14:16:00.000Z	jiltdil	auronandace	 oh i need better fighting game than nexuiz :)
2012-01-07T14:17:00.000Z	auronandace	jiltdil	you still haven't defined "better"
2012-01-07T14:17:00.000Z	jiltdil	auronandace	 in the sens of quality and complexity
2012-01-07T14:20:00.000Z	jiltdil	auronandace	 thanks a lot :)
2012-02-02T00:22:00.000Z	auronandace	jiltdil	the only way you'd find that out would be if you built it yourself
2012-02-02T00:23:00.000Z	auronandace	jiltdil	sorry, i thought you meant all the hardware (not just the harddrive)
2012-02-06T22:30:00.000Z	auronandace	jiltdil	try it and find out
2012-02-13T23:24:00.000Z	auronandace	jiltdil	sounds like you unwittingly downloaded a torrent
