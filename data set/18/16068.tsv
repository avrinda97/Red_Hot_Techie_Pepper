2004-11-18T11:47:00.000Z	WebMaven		Well, my point was that the *perceived* arrogance (even in the *friendliest* support channels) is just a reaction to a large *number* (not percentage) of lazy questioners.
2004-11-18T11:47:00.000Z	WebMaven		And thus, bears a direct linear relationship to popularity.
2004-11-18T11:48:00.000Z	WebMaven		on a list I am on, the questioner asked "how do I do x?"
2004-11-18T11:48:00.000Z	thoreauputic	WebMaven	some are even worse than lazy - like the ones who are given valid answers and yet repeat the same question again and again...
2004-11-18T11:57:00.000Z	thoreauputic	WebMaven	I agree - unfortunately the people who most need to read that link are the ones who don't read *any* links you give them, so...
2004-11-18T11:59:00.000Z	WebMaven	thoreauputic	I guess I'm just making the point that it is the willfully clueless that are the real problem, and that they get stomped on for very good reasons.
2004-11-18T12:00:00.000Z	thoreauputic	WebMaven	yes.
2004-11-20T08:35:00.000Z	thoreauputic	WebMaven	I assume he's installing 1.0
2004-11-20T08:37:00.000Z	thoreauputic	WebMaven	of course, but he's installing the latest, released today by Mozilla.org
2004-11-20T08:38:00.000Z	WebMaven	thoreauputic	but, is there some *reason* to install the latest, rather than use the most recent package avaialable?
2004-11-20T08:38:00.000Z	thoreauputic	WebMaven	only terminal "newisbetter" disease
2004-11-20T08:43:00.000Z	WebMaven	thoreauputic	I think he just extracted the installer, but didn't run it yet.
2004-11-20T08:49:00.000Z	WebMaven	thoreauputic	technically, it's a Gnome question at this point.
2004-11-20T08:49:00.000Z	thoreauputic	WebMaven	technically, Xandros changes all kinds of stuff
2004-11-20T08:50:00.000Z	thoreauputic	WebMaven	your assumption may or may not be correct in other words
2005-08-08T07:08:00.000Z	thoreauputic	WebMaven	try running alsamixer in a terminal to adjust things
2005-08-08T07:47:00.000Z	thoreauputic	WebMaven	look for mm and hit m to unmute a channel
2005-08-08T07:48:00.000Z	WebMaven	thoreauputic	unmuting the Master channel had no effect.
