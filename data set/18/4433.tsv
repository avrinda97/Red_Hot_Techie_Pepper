2009-04-11T15:42:00.000Z	O_EDI		Hi, what is the opimal java package to install in ubuntu 8.10 : from sun or from OpenJDK?
2009-04-11T15:42:00.000Z	Brucevdk	O_EDI	OpenJDK
2009-04-11T15:44:00.000Z	O_EDI	Brucevdk	is there any configuration i should do in order to set the environment and keep OpenOffice running with OpenJDK?
2009-04-11T15:45:00.000Z	Brucevdk	O_EDI	sudo update-java-alternatives -s java-6-openjdk and possibly the Java configuration bit in OOo itself
2009-04-11T16:02:00.000Z	O_EDI	Brucevdk	i am trying to set the java configuration for OpenOffice, but it doesn't take the configuration from /usr/lib/jvm/default-java/jre
2009-04-11T16:03:00.000Z	Brucevdk	O_EDI	I've got it set in Tools -> Options -> Java, how do you know it doesn't work for you?
2009-04-11T16:04:00.000Z	Brucevdk	O_EDI	oh wait, default-java, yeah well I'm not sure how that would work
2009-04-11T16:04:00.000Z	Brucevdk	O_EDI	works for me
2009-04-11T16:04:00.000Z	Brucevdk	O_EDI	what openjdk packages did you install?
2009-04-11T16:07:00.000Z	O_EDI	Brucevdk	if i use the /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk/ i have same trouble. Sshould i install all the OpenJDK packages available? or is it that i'm looking at the jre directory?
2009-04-11T16:07:00.000Z	Brucevdk	O_EDI	you need the JRE, the location for me is /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk/jre
2009-04-11T16:08:00.000Z	O_EDI	Brucevdk	openjdk-6-jre,openjdk-6-jre-headless and openjdk-6-lib
2009-04-11T16:17:00.000Z	Brucevdk	O_EDI	great
2009-04-11T16:18:00.000Z	O_EDI	Brucevdk	is there any other config needed, such as parameters or class path for the OO's java configuration?
2009-04-11T16:18:00.000Z	Brucevdk	O_EDI	for the basic functionalit, no
2009-04-11T16:23:00.000Z	O_EDI	Brucevdk	afterthat configuration, is it usual that opened PPTs in OO don't reproduce the sound in a continuous way? what causes it?
2009-04-11T16:24:00.000Z	Brucevdk	O_EDI	not sure, I'm a little busy so I can't help you much sorry :-)
2009-04-11T16:24:00.000Z	O_EDI	Brucevdk	thatk you for your help :)
