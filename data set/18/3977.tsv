2009-06-23T23:39:00.000Z	mazda01	joeyeye	as you can see the text is black and the background is blue.
2009-06-23T23:40:00.000Z	joeyeye	mazda01	yes but test.mpg is purple...
2009-06-23T23:41:00.000Z	mazda01	joeyeye	yeap! that was it. THANKS!
2009-06-23T23:41:00.000Z	joeyeye	mazda01	select a region of text using mouse ... do you see it ?
2009-06-23T23:41:00.000Z	mazda01	joeyeye	now trying to solve a myth2xbmc issue with connecting to database. Any experience with it?
2009-06-23T23:42:00.000Z	joeyeye	mazda01	I'm not familiar with myth2xbmc ... what is it ?
2009-06-23T23:42:00.000Z	mazda01	joeyeye	it's a mythtvfrontend for the xbox so you can connect to the mythtv backend and delete recordings after you watch them, schedule recordings, watch live tv, etc etc. Mythtv is awesome!
2009-06-23T23:43:00.000Z	joeyeye	mazda01	I'm familar with tversity ... not mythtv, sorry - but I will check mythtv out as I was looking for a media server for ubuntu
2009-06-23T23:44:00.000Z	mazda01	joeyeye	if you just want a media server and not to be able to record live tv using a capture card,. then I would go with XBMC. It's awesome!
2009-06-23T23:45:00.000Z	joeyeye	mazda01	IS xbmc DLNA compat ?
2009-06-23T23:45:00.000Z	mazda01	joeyeye	yeap!
2009-06-23T23:45:00.000Z	mazda01	joeyeye	there's an itunes plugin also.
2009-06-23T23:46:00.000Z	joeyeye	mazda01	does it transcode ... ?
2009-06-23T23:46:00.000Z	joeyeye	mazda01	I want it to deliver media to my directv hd dvr ...
2009-06-23T23:48:00.000Z	mazda01	joeyeye	not sure. you'd have to research it. i don't think so though. you could easily setup a script to do that though.
2009-06-23T23:48:00.000Z	joeyeye	mazda01	thanks for the heads up! Much appreciated, I am reading the website now!
2009-06-23T23:49:00.000Z	mazda01	joeyeye	cool.
