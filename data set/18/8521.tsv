2007-11-05T15:46:00.000Z	Alloosh		troc, its not letting me upload the images from my local machine to the online server,
2007-11-05T15:47:00.000Z	Alloosh		I went to the files and tried to change the owner, but it wont let me, how do I become root?
2007-11-05T15:47:00.000Z	ikonia	Alloosh	sudo
2007-11-19T14:13:00.000Z	ikonia	Alloosh	you've just shown us the command
2007-11-19T14:15:00.000Z	Alloosh	ikonia	tried it but didnt work I think, lets make the question how do I change the owner to myself, because the owner now is root and I want the owner to be alloosh
2007-11-19T14:16:00.000Z	ikonia	Alloosh	man chown
