2005-08-02T09:50:00.000Z	thoreauputic	user_	set the output plugin to esound

2005-08-02T10:15:00.000Z	thoreauputic	user_	some people have had success by installing libmikmod2 I think - but it should be installed as a dep anyway ( dpkg -l libmikmod2 to see )
2005-08-02T10:26:00.000Z	thoreauputic	user_	have you tried "killall esd" before running xmms ?
2005-08-02T10:30:00.000Z	thoreauputic	user_	we are troubleshooting... if killing esd works you know esd is the problem, right?
2005-08-02T10:33:00.000Z	thoreauputic	user_	if you kill esd you'll need to select oss or alsa as output in xmms
