2009-09-11T19:28:00.000Z	ansis		Hi, could anyone help to troubleshoot why my Ubuntu 9.04 automatically reboots 9 times of 10 during the Boot-Up? And quite oftenly freezes.
2009-09-11T19:29:00.000Z	Halitech	ansis	can you boot from the cd and run memtest and see if its bad ram
2009-09-11T19:29:00.000Z	ansis	Halitech	I did the memtest, it finished without errors.
2009-09-11T19:30:00.000Z	Halitech	ansis	how far does it get in the boot before it reboots?
2009-09-11T19:32:00.000Z	ansis	Halitech	right after I choose the OS from Grub loader
2009-09-11T19:32:00.000Z	Halitech	ansis	do you have windows installed and does it boot?
2009-09-11T19:32:00.000Z	ansis	Halitech	I do not have windows.
2009-09-11T19:33:00.000Z	Halitech	ansis	ok ... can you boot an older kernel?
2009-09-11T19:34:00.000Z	ansis	Halitech	nop the same applies to older kernels. Where to diagnose Hard Disk errors?
2009-09-11T19:34:00.000Z	Halitech	ansis	might want to look into ultimate boot cd to test the drive
2009-09-11T19:37:00.000Z	ansis	Halitech	actually I am thinking that this might be a Hardware error. Right now It booted! I bet that after 10minutes it will freeze again. Where to look for bootup error logs?
2009-09-11T19:38:00.000Z	Halitech	ansis	/var/logs
2009-09-11T19:40:00.000Z	ansis	Halitech	Ok, this line looks suspicious gdmgreeter[3020]: segfault at 13a ip 00007fadf3bfbaa3
2009-09-11T19:41:00.000Z	Halitech	ansis	I used to see similiar errors when I was using a drive that was dying
2009-09-11T19:42:00.000Z	ansis	Halitech	that Ultimate Boot CD will verify this?
2009-09-11T19:42:00.000Z	ansis		(the HDD)
2009-09-11T19:43:00.000Z	Halitech	ansis	it should
2009-09-11T19:44:00.000Z	ansis	Halitech	ok thanks, I will try it out
