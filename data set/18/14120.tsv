2008-12-23T01:02:00.000Z	trentor		For wine, I got to uninstall wine, then "Install.." button to install software.  I am not really sure why it would have me go to the wine "uninstaller" to go to install my windows software.
2008-12-23T01:02:00.000Z	trentor		And wine in the terminal can only run programs, it cannot install them to my knowledge
2008-12-23T01:03:00.000Z	trentor		slart:  will linux recognize windows msi files along with the exe files?
2008-12-23T01:04:00.000Z	trentor		I'm half tempted to try winelib after this :S
2008-12-23T01:06:00.000Z	trentor		Does anyone have a helpful internet link as to understanding how linux installing works in comparrison to windows.  I recently made the switch to linux and that is a main aspect I am struggling with.
2008-12-23T01:07:00.000Z	Flannel	trentor	What do you mean "linux installing"?  Installing software?  installing the whole OS?

2008-12-23T01:08:00.000Z	Flannel	trentor	That one will discuss how the repositories work (first and second), this will give you an overview of the (more complicated/detailed) way of installing stuff: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SynapticHowto
2008-12-23T01:08:00.000Z	Flannel	trentor	The easier way is through "add/remove programs", which is somewhat self explanatory (check what you want, install it)
2008-12-23T01:10:00.000Z	Flannel	trentor	Of course, Synaptic is the same way (select what you want, hit apply, it installs), it just gives you the entire repositories to choose from, which means you'll en up seeing libraries, etc.
2008-12-23T01:12:00.000Z	Flannel	trentor	Right, add/remove only shows you a small subset of the programs available.  Use synaptic package manager to seeeverything
2008-12-23T01:14:00.000Z	Flannel	trentor	It will show up in synaptic
2008-12-23T01:15:00.000Z	Flannel	trentor	Even if you just installed it manually (download the deb, and install it manually, and it'll still show up)
2008-12-23T01:15:00.000Z	Flannel	trentor	Pastebin the output of `apt-cache policy wine`
2008-12-23T01:17:00.000Z	Flannel	trentor	yeah. You installed it manually (download the deb, install the deb), but that should still show up in synaptic
2008-12-23T01:17:00.000Z	Flannel	trentor	also, if you want to use the winehq version, you should add the winehq repository, not just download individually
2008-12-23T01:18:00.000Z	Flannel	trentor	it doesn't matter.  Terminal is easier for instruction over IRC, obviously
2008-12-23T01:18:00.000Z	Flannel	trentor	All of the apt frontends work with the same data, so you can switch back and forth at will, etc.  It's a lovely thing ;)
