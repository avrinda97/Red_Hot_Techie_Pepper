2010-10-13T19:17:00.000Z	joby		Flash games is easiest page wont load, says try updating your flash player but i have the lastest flash installed allready
2010-10-13T19:18:00.000Z	janisozaur	joby	which version? www.adobe.com/software/flash/about/
2010-10-13T19:19:00.000Z	janisozaur	joby	there is no such version. do you use gnash?
2010-10-13T19:21:00.000Z	janisozaur	joby	what browser do you use?
2010-10-13T19:22:00.000Z	janisozaur	joby	"ps ax | grep firefox", find its pid (first column), then "lsof -p <firefox_pid>"
2010-10-13T19:22:00.000Z	janisozaur	joby	or rather "lsof -p <firefox_pid> | grep -i flash"
2010-10-13T19:28:00.000Z	janisozaur	joby	yes. and when using irc, be sure to type name of the other person you're talking to in front of message
2010-10-13T19:29:00.000Z	janisozaur	joby	also be sure that firefox with some page that utilises flash is running at the time you execute this command
2010-10-13T19:48:00.000Z	joby	janisozaur	i coped this into the terminal:  lsof -p<firefox pid> grep -i flash  = bash: firefox: No such file or directory
2010-10-13T19:49:00.000Z	janisozaur	joby	you're supposed to replace "<firefox pid>" with well... its value
2010-10-13T19:50:00.000Z	joby	janisozaur	what the value what am i supposed to put in there i dont understand
2010-10-13T19:51:00.000Z	janisozaur	joby	the one you got with "ps ax | grep firefox"
2010-10-13T19:52:00.000Z	joby	janisozaur	i have looked but im sorry i dont understand what ur wanting me to do i see all the codes
2010-10-13T19:55:00.000Z	janisozaur	joby	that's because you apparently use gnash, which is open-source flash, but might not work with 100% content out there
2010-10-13T19:55:00.000Z	janisozaur	joby	but since you're not able to execute the simplest commands I can't help you
2010-10-13T19:56:00.000Z	joby	janisozaur	well everything work untill i update to 10.10
2010-10-13T19:57:00.000Z	janisozaur	joby	do you even read what I say? it seems that you can't comprehend it, so please stop bugging me. there might be someone else that could help you
