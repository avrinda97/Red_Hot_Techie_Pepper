2010-06-08T06:47:00.000Z	hiexpo	Pelo	for the awus036h
2010-06-08T06:48:00.000Z	Pelo	hiexpo	that's the answer I was looking for
2010-06-08T06:49:00.000Z	hiexpo	Pelo	i already have a wireless card working in my notebook but don't wanna brick it installing the new one
2010-06-08T06:50:00.000Z	Pelo	hiexpo	what's the file ending for the driver file ?
2010-06-08T06:50:00.000Z	hiexpo	Pelo	heres the link to the patch i got
2010-06-08T06:50:00.000Z	hiexpo	Pelo	 - http://forum.aircrack-ng.org/index.php?topic=5755.0
2010-06-08T06:52:00.000Z	Pelo	hiexpo	which part is giving you trouble ?
2010-06-08T06:53:00.000Z	Pelo	hiexpo	sk is a troll,  probably jsut a bot
2010-06-08T06:53:00.000Z	hiexpo	Pelo	 - sudo rmmod r8187 rtl8187 mac80211 cfg80211 because the last two  are being used by my other card
2010-06-08T06:53:00.000Z	hiexpo	Pelo	that was an oops
2010-06-08T06:53:00.000Z	Pelo	hiexpo	simple enoungh, don'T list the last two in the rmmod command
2010-06-08T06:54:00.000Z	Pelo	hiexpo	still around ?
2010-06-08T06:54:00.000Z	hiexpo	Pelo	yes but will it still work that way?
2010-06-08T06:55:00.000Z	Pelo	hiexpo	I don'T see why it shouldn'T
2010-06-08T06:56:00.000Z	Pelo	hiexpo	at this point I'M just guessing, but this is how I would go about it myself,  worse case scenario it won't work but you won'T have removed the drivers you are  currently using
