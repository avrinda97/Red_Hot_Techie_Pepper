2009-05-24T05:01:00.000Z	esde		So, i and to use PGP encryption, preferably 1024bit, on my external hard drive. i am on Ubuntu 9.04. ideas on programs and tut on how to do this please? i have about 10g or so i need to encrypt. and it needs to be hella secure.
2009-05-24T05:01:00.000Z	Zzeiss	esde	The big problem is you will have to "whiten" the disk where the un-encrypted copy lived.
2009-05-24T05:02:00.000Z	Zzeiss	esde	Fortunately, there is a command that does that now.... called "shred".
2009-05-24T05:02:00.000Z	esde	Zzeiss	thats what im worried about, i need to "wipe" my HDD from the old stuff and my external
2009-05-24T05:03:00.000Z	Zzeiss	esde	If you need a real wipe, take the disk apart, put some sand inside, and then bash the disks with a hammer till they are in pieces.  Nothing else is REALLY secure.  (the DOD uses "run over it with a tank and then use it for rifle practice" but the end effect is the same).
2009-05-24T05:04:00.000Z	esde	Zzeiss	nice sarcasm but seriously whats the best tool for pgp?
2009-05-24T05:05:00.000Z	Zzeiss	esde	If you can't wipe the old data, then don't bother with PGP.  "dd" can pull the data off the disk with a single command.
2009-05-24T05:05:00.000Z	Zzeiss	esde	the real question you need to answer is this: "If someone decrypts this data, would I be willing to pay $100 to have that UN_happen?"
2009-05-24T05:06:00.000Z	esde	Zzeiss	"UN_happen"?
2009-05-24T05:06:00.000Z	Zzeiss	esde	Un-happen means make it like it never happened in the first place.  Like that guy on HEROES goes back in time and makes sure it never happened.
2009-05-24T05:07:00.000Z	Zzeiss	esde	anyway, if you would pay the cost of the disk to make it UNhappen, then buy a new disk that holds the encrypted version and then destroy the original.
2009-05-24T05:07:00.000Z	Zzeiss	esde	OK... so long as you won't be doing time in Federal Prison if it gets decrypted or read from the freespace... no problem.
2009-05-24T05:09:00.000Z	Zzeiss	esde	note that if the disk uses sector reallocation if a sector seems wonky, then encrypting the freespace is NOT gauranteed to get rid of everything.  The only solution is to destroy the media (hence, that's why DoD always destroys media).
2009-05-24T05:09:00.000Z	esde	Zzeiss	its stuff i dont want the feds getting, no CP but a LOT of cracked stuff etc etc.
2009-05-24T05:09:00.000Z	Zzeiss	esde	If you can do prison time because of it, do like the DoD.  Encrypt to new media, then physical destruction of old media.
2009-05-24T05:10:00.000Z	Zzeiss	esde	This _is_ my social net.  :)
2009-05-24T05:12:00.000Z	Zzeiss	esde	Now a word of advice: Don't bother with cracked media.  If you don't have physical media, don't use it.  This is _why_ I much prefer free software: no need to fear a raid.
2009-05-24T05:13:00.000Z	Zzeiss	esde	once I got the "BSA Audit" letter when I had a small biz.  "We want to audit you".  I told them "Sure, but since it's a firing offense to run non-open-source software in this company without my signature OKing it, and I haven't OKed it, you are wasting your time."  They did not call back.  :)
