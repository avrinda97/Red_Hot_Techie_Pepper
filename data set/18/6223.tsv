2008-10-10T19:31:00.000Z	cinimod25		﻿sqawarlz im mistaken i ment dual core not 2 physical cpus
2008-10-10T19:31:00.000Z	cinimod25		i have dual cores
2008-10-10T19:31:00.000Z	cinimod25		﻿sqawarlz i thought having a dual core is like having 2 cpus?
2008-10-10T19:32:00.000Z	cinimod25		in my bios it shows up as 2 cpus running at 2.8ghz
2008-10-10T19:33:00.000Z	cinimod25		so a dual core, and a quad core is not really 2 cpu's?
2008-10-10T19:33:00.000Z	cinimod25		sorry a dual is not realy 2 cup's an d aquad is not 4?
2008-10-10T19:34:00.000Z	cinimod25		when i had a hyper thread cpu it showed up as 2 cpus in ubuntu
2008-10-10T19:34:00.000Z	cinimod25		but when i actually have a dual core it only show's up as one cpu

2008-10-10T19:41:00.000Z	cinimod25	erUSUL	i have a Pentium D
2008-10-10T19:42:00.000Z	erUSUL	cinimod25	are you using any boot option for your kernel ? like noapic or something like that??
2008-10-10T19:42:00.000Z	erUSUL	cinimod25	also posting the output of "dmesg" and "cat /proc/cpuinfo" onto pastebin would be helpfull
