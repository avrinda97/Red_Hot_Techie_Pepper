2009-08-15T14:57:00.000Z	Kharn	kbp	i've attempted to stop ssl, which removes the first line of the error, however the rest remain
2009-08-15T14:58:00.000Z	kbp	Kharn	so is there anyother app tecking port 5432? as the hint?
2009-08-15T14:59:00.000Z	kbp	Kharn	*taking
2009-08-15T14:59:00.000Z	Kharn	kbp	not that i can see ... nothing at all\
2009-08-15T15:00:00.000Z	kbp	Kharn	just make sure please run sudo netstat -anltp|grep :5432 on the server
2009-08-15T15:01:00.000Z	Kharn	kbp	no output
2009-08-15T15:04:00.000Z	kbp	Kharn	is any other service working well? (i.e. ftp, ssh etc.?) because the last line says: could not create ANY TCP/IP sockets
2009-08-15T15:06:00.000Z	kbp	Kharn	ip range stuff doesnt get involve here because as I can see it uses "localhost"
2009-08-15T15:07:00.000Z	kbp	Kharn	it can run itself without any internet/lan connection
2009-08-15T15:07:00.000Z	kbp	Kharn	how about /etc/init.d/sumthing retart it?
2009-08-15T15:10:00.000Z	Kharn	kbp	.. somehow u gave me an idea then .. (who knows how my mind works) ... but i have it fixed ...
2009-08-15T15:11:00.000Z	kbp	Kharn	even if you turn off SSL, it still gives that SSL root.crt error? (I'm thinking that because SSL stuff makes  the socket doesnt work properly (!??) - I dunno what im talking about anyway)
2009-08-15T15:11:00.000Z	kbp	Kharn	it should be 127.0.0.1, dont use * :) for security reason
2009-08-15T15:15:00.000Z	kbp	Kharn	a hacker asked a man: "Give me your IP. I will hack you using my tool". The man replied: "127.0.0.1". The hacker says: "Haha you're dead now! I'm formatting your hdd"
2009-08-15T15:16:00.000Z	Kharn	kbp	:P
