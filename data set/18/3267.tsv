2010-01-15T03:00:00.000Z	RyanD		hi, i need a hand with my ubuntu install. any takers
2010-01-15T03:01:00.000Z	DasEi	RyanD	details ?
2010-01-15T03:01:00.000Z	RyanD		ok...i installed using the windows utility and when I get to the boot it drops to the sh:grub/. prompt
2010-01-15T03:02:00.000Z	RyanD		sh:grub>
2010-01-15T03:02:00.000Z	DasEi	RyanD	mmh, wubi, really just a try out-tool.. any important data on it ?
2010-01-15T03:03:00.000Z	RyanD		nope...I tried to dual boot with Win 7 but couldn't get ubuntu to boot
2010-01-15T03:04:00.000Z	DasEi		!who | RyanD, dualboot so
2010-01-15T03:04:00.000Z	DasEi	RyanD	in which order did you install ?
2010-01-15T03:05:00.000Z	DasEi		!lucid | yo2boy
2010-01-15T03:08:00.000Z	RyanD	DasEi	- I installed Win first and it is not possible to do a clean install of Win7 as it has a bunch of files and programs
2010-01-15T03:09:00.000Z	RyanD		Dunkirk - windows is ok. i want to boot into ubuntu
2010-01-15T03:12:00.000Z	DasEi	RyanD	so is your windows-start still in order or are both os'es unaccesible ?
2010-01-15T03:14:00.000Z	DasEi		edzig: can use mode aprameter in xorg.conf to set default resolution
2010-01-15T03:14:00.000Z	DasEi		!resolution | edzig
2010-01-15T03:15:00.000Z	RyanD	DasEi	- to be honest I haven't tried to boot into win7 yet but it is listed in the win boot loader so it probably will boot but I can fix it if it doesn't
2010-01-15T03:16:00.000Z	DasEi	RyanD	so you installed karmic after win 7, now have grub with a windows entry and a karmic that won't boot
2010-01-15T03:17:00.000Z	DasEi	RyanD	did you try to boot safemode ?
2010-01-15T03:18:00.000Z	RyanD	DasEi	- that was my problem yesterday. so i gave up and blew away the linux part and installed from within win7 (wubi??) now i have a ubuntu entry in my win bootloader but grub drops to the sh:grub> prompt
