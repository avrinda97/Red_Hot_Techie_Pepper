2009-12-28T21:17:00.000Z	LewisDre4m		Hello, please help before I set fire to my computer and to myself. Here I am yet again trying to do a simple task on Ubuntu and it's been made dificult. I want to rip a CD with Sound Juicer, so I do . . . But its 128kbps quality. I go into change it go through prefrences and go to mp3 go to edit and instead of what any sane person would expect to see eg. drop down menu with bit rates I have GSTREAMER: audio/x-raw-int,rate=44100,channels=2 ! lame name=en

2009-12-28T21:20:00.000Z	LewisDre4m		Has no one in this room EVER used sound juicer to rip a cd above 128 quality>
2009-12-28T21:22:00.000Z	LewisDre4m		Does anyone know what I have to change in this . . . GSTREAMER: audio/x-raw-int,rate=44100,channels=2 ! lame name=enc mode=0 vbr-quality=7 ! id3v2mux . Now If in that text I could to get higher bitrate when I rip cd's?
2009-12-28T21:23:00.000Z	LewisDre4m		sorry VBR is 6 I copyed wrong
2009-12-28T21:25:00.000Z	LewisDre4m		I cannot believe no one in here has ever wanted to rip a cd above 128 k quality
2009-12-28T21:26:00.000Z	LewisDre4m		128 k is for tards no doubt about it
2009-12-28T21:28:00.000Z	llutz	LewisDre4m	or ripperx
2009-12-28T21:29:00.000Z	LewisDre4m	llutz	took a look at ripper x and you cant change bit rate
2009-12-28T21:29:00.000Z	llutz	LewisDre4m	sure you can
2009-12-28T21:29:00.000Z	llutz	LewisDre4m	vbr, 320k works fine
2009-12-28T21:31:00.000Z	LewisDre4m	llutz	Oh . . . Yes your right however the reason I couldn't use it is it doesn't seem to see my cd driver. Other wise that seemed like the most perfect sofrtware
2009-12-28T21:37:00.000Z	llutz	LewisDre4m	ripperx doesn't seem to have any option to change the drive :(
2009-12-28T21:39:00.000Z	llutz	LewisDre4m	it has, hidden, see faq 3 http://ripperx.sourceforge.net/faq.html
2009-12-28T21:39:00.000Z	LewisDre4m	llutz	 GOOOOOOOOOOOO RIPPER X! Seems to be doing the job If this CD drive doens't start smokin I will be alright
