2009-01-17T09:30:00.000Z	jedi06		does ubuntu come with smb?
2009-01-17T09:31:00.000Z	dmizer	jedi06	the client or the server?
2009-01-17T09:35:00.000Z	dmizer	jedi06	have a look here -> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=288534
2009-01-17T09:43:00.000Z	jedi06	dmizer	it doesn't look like they are on the same subnet?? XP: 192.168... Vbox Ubuntu: 10.0.2.15
2009-01-17T09:43:00.000Z	dmizer	jedi06	that's going to be a problem for any client windows or ubuntu. is there no way for you to get on the same subnet?
2009-01-17T09:46:00.000Z	jedi06	dmizer	have you use vbox?
2009-01-17T09:46:00.000Z	dmizer	jedi06	are you using a virtual machine?
2009-01-17T09:46:00.000Z	jedi06	dmizer	yes
2009-01-17T09:48:00.000Z	dmizer	jedi06	then both your virtual client and your host ARE on the same subnet.
2009-01-17T09:48:00.000Z	jedi06	dmizer	^
2009-01-17T09:50:00.000Z	dmizer	jedi06	trust me, your host and virtual guest are on a shared subnet.
2009-01-17T09:51:00.000Z	dmizer	jedi06	if your guest and host did not have a shared subnet, then the guest would be unable to access the internet.
2009-01-17T09:53:00.000Z	dmizer	jedi06	you can still transfer files between your guest and host. if you need them to be on the same subnet, you'll need to configure virtualbox for bridged networking.
2009-01-17T10:02:00.000Z	jedi06	dmizer	i don't think i can do that tutorial becuase i can't reboot i'm using livecd
2009-01-17T10:03:00.000Z	dmizer	jedi06	try places > connect to server, if that doesn't work i'm not sure what to tell you.
2009-01-17T10:03:00.000Z	jedi06	dmizer	i'm using ubuntu_recovery_remix it is only command line
2009-01-17T10:06:00.000Z	dmizer	jedi06	you'll have to configure the host for bridged networking. if once you do that, then you should be able to follow the howto without rebooting.
2009-01-17T10:09:00.000Z	jedi06	dmizer	thanks
