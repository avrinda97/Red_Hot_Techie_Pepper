2010-12-19T05:30:00.000Z	dnivra	psicobra	you reinstalled ubuntu twice? you should've just reinstalled grub. anyway even with a reinstall it doesn't get fixed? that's weird.
2010-12-19T05:30:00.000Z	dnivra	psicobra	goes straight to the prompt?

2010-12-19T05:31:00.000Z	dnivra	psicobra	well i really don't have much of a clue. try reinstalling grub; you did reinstall when you installed ubuntu but still-while you wait to see if someone else can help
