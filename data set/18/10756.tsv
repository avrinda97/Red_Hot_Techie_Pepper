2007-07-02T09:07:00.000Z	dawn_		anybody that i can ask about pidgin?
2007-07-02T09:07:00.000Z	macogw	dawn_	what about it?
2007-07-02T09:08:00.000Z	macogw	dawn_	the way that the font is SENT or the way that you view it?
2007-07-02T09:09:00.000Z	macogw	dawn_	tools > preferences > conversations > default formatting
2007-07-02T09:14:00.000Z	dawn_	macogw	i don't see the font the way i set it when i type in the window .
2007-07-02T09:14:00.000Z	macogw	dawn_	does it look right where you type it but not once you send it?
2007-07-02T09:16:00.000Z	dawn_	macogw	not for both.. when i type it and when it's sent.
2007-07-02T09:17:00.000Z	macogw	dawn_	for which does it look correct?
2007-07-02T09:18:00.000Z	dawn_	macogw	only in preferences
2007-07-02T09:18:00.000Z	macogw	dawn_	so when you're typing the message AND after you send it, it looks wrong?
2007-07-02T09:19:00.000Z	dawn_	macogw	^
2007-07-02T09:19:00.000Z	macogw	dawn_	there's a conversations colors plugin (installed, just activate it) which changes how the messages appear for messages you send and receive when *you* view them, but i dont believe it modifies how the other person views them
2007-07-02T09:21:00.000Z	macogw	dawn_	well, i'm not sure if its a matter of the other person sees it and you dont or if it does nothing at all
2007-07-02T09:22:00.000Z	macogw	dawn_	 will try now
2007-07-02T09:23:00.000Z	macogw	dawn_	i just changed my font color in default formatting and my friend saw it fine
2007-07-02T09:23:00.000Z	dawn_	macogw	are you both using pidgin? or is he using something else?
2007-07-02T09:24:00.000Z	macogw	dawn_	im using pidgin, he's probably using kopete
2007-07-02T11:07:00.000Z	macogw	dawn_	if youre trying to get generics, those require java 1.5 and eclipse on ubuntu uses gcj (1.4 compatible) by default, i think
