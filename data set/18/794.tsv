2011-09-05T10:44:00.000Z	satanrm		what is a new window manager which will have a menu like gnome-panel in 2.0?
2011-09-05T10:45:00.000Z	satanrm		the newer unity and gnome 3 both are fail!
2011-09-05T10:45:00.000Z	satanrm		the session-fallback will look like gnome-panel?
2011-09-05T10:46:00.000Z	satanrm		i am thinking because ubuntu will ask me to upgrade later and i will have to use a shit unity or gnome 3
