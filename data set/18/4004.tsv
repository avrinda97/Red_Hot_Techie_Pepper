2009-07-25T10:59:00.000Z	n2diy	wizzo50	how do you figure linux is older then Windows? And why isn' Windows 100% correct?
2009-07-25T11:00:00.000Z	wizzo50	n2diy	I didn't say WIndows wasn't 100%. I am talking about Linux which is what most of Ubuntu is.
2009-07-25T11:01:00.000Z	n2diy	wizzo50	ok, linux is 100% volunteer, Microsoft is 100% $$$, who should be leading?
2009-07-25T11:03:00.000Z	n2diy	wizzo50	your nuts, linux came out in 1991, when I was nearly 30.
2009-07-25T11:05:00.000Z	wizzo50	n2diy	Read up on it. It was out when the DOS edition was out then before you was born. RPG- machine language then with Apple and Commodore
2009-07-25T11:05:00.000Z	wizzo50	n2diy	It just was as updated like it is today
2009-07-25T11:06:00.000Z	n2diy	wizzo50	I own the book "The accidental revolution" co-written by Linus Torvalds.
2009-07-25T11:07:00.000Z	wizzo50	n2diy	Good!
2009-07-25T11:07:00.000Z	n2diy	wizzo50	linux went "wild" in Sept. 91
2009-07-25T11:08:00.000Z	wizzo50	n2diy	Still wild today, to many undecided things in it that are more testing. That is why it is still free today
2009-07-25T11:17:00.000Z	n2diy	wizzo50	I backup system.
2009-07-25T11:18:00.000Z	wizzo50	n2diy	How do you run it, sudo unison?
2009-07-25T11:19:00.000Z	n2diy	wizzo50	Don't know, never used it, yet. I think you have to fetch it with synaptic, or apt-get.
2009-07-25T11:20:00.000Z	wizzo50	n2diy	ok
2009-07-25T11:21:00.000Z	wizzo50	n2diy	I just know it is a file synchronizer
2009-07-25T11:23:00.000Z	n2diy	wizzo50	yes, and that is wha I use grsync for, I mirror this box to my test box once or twice a day.
