2007-04-22T15:34:00.000Z	weltschmerz		i think my upgrade to feisty destroyed all of my music.  Tons and tons and tons of music.
2007-04-22T15:34:00.000Z	weltschmerz		for no reason.
2007-04-22T15:35:00.000Z	weltschmerz		on the backup.
2007-04-22T15:35:00.000Z	weltschmerz		why did feisty do this?
2007-04-22T15:36:00.000Z	weltschmerz		i had tons of stuff in /usr/share/ that feisty DESTROYED!!!
2007-04-22T15:37:00.000Z	weltschmerz		oh my GOD.
2007-04-22T15:37:00.000Z	weltschmerz		i wondered why my drive was so busy during my sunday rsync when i had no music added.
2007-04-22T15:37:00.000Z	weltschmerz		feisty destroyed /usr/share/music/
2007-04-22T15:37:00.000Z	weltschmerz		wtf!!
2007-04-22T15:38:00.000Z	soundray	weltschmerz	that's painful
2007-04-22T15:39:00.000Z	soundray	weltschmerz	please don't use /usr/share for user data.
2007-04-22T15:59:00.000Z	soundray	weltschmerz	where did you find your music in the end?
2007-04-22T16:00:00.000Z	weltschmerz	soundray	it actually was in /usr/share/AUDIO but somehow the backup /backup/AUDIO was just ...gone.
2007-04-23T16:02:00.000Z	soundray	weltschmerz	I would still strongly recommend putting your music elsewhere. I would use /var/local/music or similar.
2007-04-23T16:02:00.000Z	soundray	weltschmerz	best way to restart alsa is to reboot
2007-04-23T16:02:00.000Z	soundray	weltschmerz	if that's not an option, 'sudo invoke-rc.d alsa-utils restart'
2007-04-23T16:03:00.000Z	weltschmerz	soundray	golden!
2007-04-23T16:04:00.000Z	weltschmerz	soundray	but still no little red laser light from my SPDIF cable. :(
