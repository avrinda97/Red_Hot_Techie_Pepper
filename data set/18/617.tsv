2011-11-30T16:06:00.000Z	SoWhat		hello! can you tell my what to do if after installing Ubuntu I have text "grub rescue>" ?
2011-11-30T16:07:00.000Z	dr_willis	SoWhat	 grub failed to install properly. which is sort of rare. but not unheard of.  whats your level of linux experience?
2011-11-30T16:07:00.000Z	SoWhat	dr_willis	wery small experiance :) total beginner
2011-11-30T16:08:00.000Z	dr_willis	SoWhat	 exactly how did you do that install?  from within windows? booted a live cd/usb? or how exactly.
2011-11-30T16:16:00.000Z	SoWhat	dr_willis	I had Ubuntu, then I installed W7, then grub dissapeared, then I reinstalled Ubuntu from USB, but in the end of installation there was written "An attempt to install additional packages from the CD failed". This is stupid, because I wasnt using CD, but USB
2011-11-30T16:17:00.000Z	dr_willis	SoWhat	 if windows whiped out the bootloader., you just had to reinstall grub not the whole s.
2011-11-30T16:17:00.000Z	dr_willis	SoWhat	 ive seen some cases where the installer gets confused and thinks theres a cd..
2011-11-30T16:18:00.000Z	SoWhat	dr_willis	I tried that in the beginning, but didn't help
2011-11-30T16:18:00.000Z	SoWhat	dr_willis	I had almost clean Ubuntu install, so it didn't matter a lot
2011-11-30T16:19:00.000Z	dr_willis	SoWhat	 ive never had that erorr when installing from usb. so cant really suggest a fix for it.
2011-11-30T16:19:00.000Z	SoWhat	dr_willis	there is already bug reported on this CD issue https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubiquity/+bug/658865
2011-11-30T16:20:00.000Z	SoWhat	dr_willis	how do you think, could this grub error be because of CD bug?
2011-11-30T16:20:00.000Z	dr_willis	SoWhat	 could be. it did a partitial install and dident complete.. so yes. i whoudl think so
2011-11-30T16:20:00.000Z	dr_willis	SoWhat	 try installing from cd. i guess would be the easists work around.
2011-11-30T16:22:00.000Z	SoWhat	dr_willis	As I understand from this link, I just have to move some files in my USB to different location.
2011-12-05T19:27:00.000Z	dr_willis	SoWhat	 pavcontrol perhaps. or some of the other pa* tools
2011-12-05T22:12:00.000Z	dr_willis	SoWhat	 the #ubuntuone channel may help better with that.
2011-12-05T22:14:00.000Z	SoWhat	dr_willis	thanks
