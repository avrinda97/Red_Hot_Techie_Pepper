2010-02-05T05:06:00.000Z	Random832		hyperstation; sudo passwd root
2010-02-05T05:07:00.000Z	Random832		why do you need to though? if you want a # shell just do sudo -s
2010-02-05T05:07:00.000Z	Random832		ZykoticK9; i just scrolled up and saw that... is there some sort of official document listing things we're not allowed to help people with?
2010-02-05T05:08:00.000Z	Random832		hyperstation; no i mean type the command "sudo passwd root", then enter a password for root.
2010-02-05T05:08:00.000Z	Random832		or you could just type sudo before any command you want to run as root and leave it off, but it should have told you that
2010-02-05T05:08:00.000Z	Random832		[sudo -s to get a # shell]
2010-02-05T05:09:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Random832	i'm unaware of any "don't tell" lists (other then CoC), but you aren't suppose to give out info on setting root password
2010-02-05T05:12:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Random832	there are more road-blocks to root other then just the password, try logging into GDM as root and see how far you get
2010-02-05T05:17:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Random832	gdmflexiserver will start a 2nd X session
2010-04-11T12:02:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Random832	if by tradtitional you mean text based - its called the alternate cd or similar
2010-07-25T07:01:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Random832	+1
2010-07-25T07:47:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Random832	using sudo with graphical programs can break your account!
2010-08-15T00:40:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Random832	my only question would be "why would anyone want that?"
2010-08-15T00:40:00.000Z	Random832	ZykoticK9	32-bit processes take less ram
2010-08-15T00:40:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Random832	not is it's running on a 64bit kernel though
2011-07-01T05:43:00.000Z	Random832	ZykoticK9	no, he wants to do a wildcard match
2011-07-01T05:44:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	Random832	oh - that makes more sense ;)
