2011-11-20T07:45:00.000Z	brightspark		is there a difference, functionally speaking, between "sudo -i" and "sudo su"?
2011-11-20T07:45:00.000Z	zykotick9	brightspark	yes, use "sudo -i"
2011-11-20T07:47:00.000Z	brightspark	zykotick9	is there an occasion there "sudo su" is appropriate?  I've always been referred to that as the means to get more persistent root priveleges.
2011-11-20T07:47:00.000Z	zykotick9	brightspark	the correct way is "sudo -i"
2011-12-08T08:19:00.000Z	brightspark	zykotick9	everyone who speaks in this channel gets that message.
2011-12-08T08:20:00.000Z	zykotick9	brightspark	ah, thanks.
2012-06-05T04:13:00.000Z	zykotick9	brightspark	"aptitude safe-upgrade" ftw ;)
2012-06-05T04:14:00.000Z	zykotick9	brightspark	dpkg installs debs?
2012-06-05T04:16:00.000Z	brightspark	zykotick9	good point.  Does it connect to repositories (that's an honest question, I've never attempted it)?
2012-06-05T04:17:00.000Z	zykotick9	brightspark	dpkg doesn't to package resolution
2012-06-05T04:18:00.000Z	brightspark	zykotick9	thanks.  So if I upgrade this guy, how would I download an application?  Just apt-get, or are the repositories obsolete all together?
2012-06-05T04:19:00.000Z	zykotick9	brightspark	"sudo apt-get update" then "sudo apt-get upgrade" was my ubuntu bread-and-butter upgrade procecure.  use "sudo apt-get dist-upgrade" to mimick the update-manager thing.
2012-06-05T04:22:00.000Z	brightspark	zykotick9	thanks.  Are the repositories not maintained for 12.04 if no-one has aptitude or synaptic?  I understand how I would upgrade but I want to learn more about the system to which I would upgrade.
2012-06-05T04:23:00.000Z	zykotick9	brightspark	apt-get and aptitude and synaptic and U.S.C. all rely on dpkg in the end ;)
2012-09-25T04:12:00.000Z	zykotick9	brightspark	dpkg isn't deprecated, it's used to install all DEB packages, once apt downloads them...
2012-09-25T04:14:00.000Z	zykotick9	brightspark	you shouldn't still be using 10.10.  see "/msg ubottu 10.10" for details.
2012-09-25T04:17:00.000Z	zykotick9	brightspark	using 'non-updated' software is a bad idea...  not just for you, but for the entire internet-ecosystem...
2012-09-25T04:18:00.000Z	brightspark	zykotick9	I hadn't heard that.  Can you post a link to an essay on that?  I'd like to read more.
