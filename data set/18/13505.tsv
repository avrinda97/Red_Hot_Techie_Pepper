2005-11-19T14:45:00.000Z	clb_		if I leave the password null, can I then connect without typing one?
2005-11-19T14:46:00.000Z	bluefrog-10	clb_	ssh conf should allow you to log wihtout passwd if not mistaken
2005-11-19T14:48:00.000Z	bluefrog-10	clb_	you can allow empty passwd in sshconf
2005-11-19T14:51:00.000Z	clb_	bluefrog-10	yeah I did that.. is it secure as long as my private key doesn't get exposed?
2005-11-19T14:52:00.000Z	bluefrog-10	clb_	if you allow empty pls don't talk about security
2005-11-19T14:52:00.000Z	clb_	bluefrog-10	are you saying private key isn't secure?
2005-11-19T14:54:00.000Z	bluefrog-10	clb_	am not good enough to answer you, but when someone is talking to me about empty passwords and then security, it makes me wonder. the thing is i don't know how the ssh key exchange works, and i will have to work on that.
2005-11-19T15:01:00.000Z	bluefrog-10	clb_	if you were telling us what you want to do...
2005-11-19T15:01:00.000Z	clb_	bluefrog-10	I can't avoid entering two passwords?
2005-11-19T15:02:00.000Z	bluefrog-10	clb_	to do what? for what purpose?
2005-11-19T15:02:00.000Z	clb_	bluefrog-10	I'd like to join all my passwords into one so I don't have to type them all over again
2005-11-19T15:03:00.000Z	bluefrog-10	clb_	get windows
2005-11-19T15:03:00.000Z	clb_	bluefrog-10	how is it better in windows?
2005-11-19T15:03:00.000Z	bluefrog-10	clb_	and even on windows u will have passwords all over the place
2005-11-19T15:04:00.000Z	bluefrog-10	clb_	it's no better not worse
2005-11-19T15:05:00.000Z	bluefrog-10	clb_	if you're in company u need passwords, if you're at home well indeed u can get rid of them if you like
2005-11-19T15:06:00.000Z	bluefrog-10	clb_	when you leave your house, u close your door using locks, no?
2005-11-19T15:06:00.000Z	clb_	bluefrog-10	most of the time :)
