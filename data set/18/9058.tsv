2007-05-16T08:04:00.000Z	SickOfWindows		No more windows on the computer from now on
2007-05-16T08:06:00.000Z	SickOfWindows		the text installer is now asking me : "is system clock set to UTC". What should I say?\
2007-05-16T08:06:00.000Z	SickOfWindows		8-)
2007-05-16T08:07:00.000Z	vorbote	SickOfWindows	If you won't have windows in the system, it is practical to use UTC in the BIOS clock.
2007-05-16T08:08:00.000Z	vorbote	SickOfWindows	You can set the clock later by using ntpdate.
2007-05-16T08:08:00.000Z	vorbote	SickOfWindows	But if the time is already in localtine, you may prefer to say no.
2007-05-16T08:08:00.000Z	SickOfWindows	vorbote	can't i set it easierly?
2007-05-16T08:09:00.000Z	vorbote	SickOfWindows	The problem I see is that you are already into installation.
2007-05-16T08:10:00.000Z	vorbote	SickOfWindows	In the end, it doesn't really matter, (unless you want to install NetBSD in another partition, that one is a doozy).
2007-05-16T08:10:00.000Z	SickOfWindows	vorbote	ok.
2007-05-16T08:10:00.000Z	vorbote	SickOfWindows	So, just say no, and keep local time.
