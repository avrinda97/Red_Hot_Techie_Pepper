2011-04-30T02:52:00.000Z	AaeRohn	ActionParsnip	samtate: (in case you didnt see it, forgot to add names) well I did try a couple times... I have a Brother MFC-6490CW and the printer works fine, but the scanner does not... I have both the printer, and scanner drivers for this model for linux, but it still doesnt work
2011-04-30T02:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AaeRohn	what is the output of:  uname -m
2011-04-30T02:53:00.000Z	AaeRohn	ActionParsnip	i686
2011-04-30T02:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AaeRohn	so you installed: http://www.brother.com/pub/bsc/linux/dlf/brscan3-0.2.11-4.i386.deb
2011-04-30T02:54:00.000Z	AaeRohn	ActionParsnip	the only drivers available for the printer/scanner, so yes
2011-04-30T03:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AaeRohn	did you install the deb I gave?
2011-04-30T03:24:00.000Z	AaeRohn	ActionParsnip	I've had both printer and scanner drivers installed for a few days now
2011-04-30T03:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AaeRohn	tried a few scanning apps?
2011-04-30T03:25:00.000Z	AaeRohn	ActionParsnip	I've tried Simple Scan, Xsane Image Scanner, and GIMP
2011-04-30T03:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AaeRohn	hmm, are there any bugs logged?
2011-04-30T03:26:00.000Z	AaeRohn	ActionParsnip	only in the Xsane, "Invalid arguement"
2011-06-11T07:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AaeRohn	run:  sudo lshw -C network    use the product line to find guides
2011-06-11T07:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AaeRohn	lshw doesnt need a web connection to run
2011-06-11T07:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AaeRohn	doesn't matter, it'll still be seen. Also run: lsusb   and the 8 character hex ID will help you find guides
2011-06-11T07:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AaeRohn	does lsusb show an ID for it?
2011-06-11T07:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AaeRohn	there will be a hex ID, something like ae76:67ab    or somesuch
