2012-09-22T20:54:00.000Z	MrELusiveone		lol
2012-09-22T20:54:00.000Z	MrELusiveone		do you have all 3 on at the same time?
2012-09-22T20:55:00.000Z	gabe-20	MrELusiveone	yes, but that doesn't change anything... one, two, or three the Internet speed is the same, worst than dial-up
2012-09-22T20:56:00.000Z	MrELusiveone	gabe-20	are you using wireless on them?
2012-09-22T20:56:00.000Z	gabe-20	MrELusiveone	yes, the problem happens when I use wireless connection only
2012-09-22T20:58:00.000Z	gabe-20	MrELusiveone	I am 100% sure it has to do with an update because I have had 10.04 LTS since its release and it has never been a problem. Some forums suggest that disabling IPv6 solves the issue but it has not worked for me
2012-09-22T21:00:00.000Z	gabe-20	MrELusiveone	no, only options for the graphics card
2012-09-22T21:01:00.000Z	MrELusiveone	gabe-20	what model notebook?
2012-09-22T21:02:00.000Z	gabe-20	MrELusiveone	- TJ: I just installed a wireless NIC to the desktop to try it and is slow as well
2012-09-22T21:03:00.000Z	MrELusiveone	gabe-20	yeah unless one fo the tech suporters here have a better idea it may be due to the current driver you are using
2012-09-22T21:09:00.000Z	MrELusiveone	gabe-20	unless you can find a conflict iw ould be willing to bet the router or the routers settings are the blame
2012-09-22T21:13:00.000Z	gabe-20	MrELusiveone	Can't blane the router settings at this point, I have brought my laptop to work and it is as slow when connected wirelessly
2012-09-22T21:14:00.000Z	MrELusiveone	gabe-20	then it must be something with the driver then
2012-09-22T21:17:00.000Z	MrELusiveone	gabe-20	yeah and for me it was the other way around i acuatualy gained the ability to use the wifi on my notebook since their update
2012-09-22T21:19:00.000Z	MrELusiveone	gabe-20	i wonder if a fresh install of the latest would solve the problem or just reinstall the old ver?
2012-09-22T21:46:00.000Z	gabe-20	MrELusiveone	yes?
2012-09-22T21:47:00.000Z	MrELusiveone	gabe-20	is the 05:02.0 Ethernet controller [0200]: Atheros Communications Inc. AR2413 802.11bg NIC [168c:001a] (rev 01) your wifi or standard lan port?
2012-09-22T21:48:00.000Z	gabe-20	MrELusiveone	Wireless ;)
