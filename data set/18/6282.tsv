2008-05-31T22:19:00.000Z	yme		Hi I'm in a little emergency. I've installed something called 8.04 LTS. I fear that may mean light server? Is that correct?
2008-05-31T22:20:00.000Z	aegzorz	yme	LTS means Long Time Support
2008-05-31T22:21:00.000Z	yme	aegzorz	the problem is that when I start the system, it appears a sort of command line OS, rather than the nice UI I had before. Is there a way I can install the desktop package from the command line?
2008-05-31T22:22:00.000Z	aegzorz	yme	you could try sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart
2008-05-31T22:23:00.000Z	yme		Thanks. I'll try
2008-05-31T22:23:00.000Z	yme	aegzorz	it says command not found
2008-05-31T22:24:00.000Z	aegzorz	yme	does startx work?
2008-05-31T22:24:00.000Z	yme	aegzorz	in /etc/init.d or just from my home directory?
2008-05-31T22:24:00.000Z	aegzorz		anywhere from command line
2008-05-31T22:24:00.000Z	yme		k, I'll try
2008-05-31T22:25:00.000Z	yme	aegzorz	it says command not found
2008-05-31T22:25:00.000Z	aegzorz	yme	ok
2008-05-31T22:26:00.000Z	aegzorz		try sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
2008-05-31T22:27:00.000Z	yme	aegzorz	thanks. I'll do that
2008-05-31T22:30:00.000Z	yme	aegzorz	it's downloading a lot of stuff. I believe I didn't have any desktop package on my PC right?
2008-05-31T22:31:00.000Z	aegzorz	yme	yeah if it needs to install alot of packages it sounds like there was no desktop environment installed
2008-05-31T22:31:00.000Z	yme	aegzorz	thanks, you saved the day!!
2008-05-31T22:31:00.000Z	aegzorz	yme	no problem, glad to help
