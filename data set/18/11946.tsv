2006-09-12T16:03:00.000Z	theBeno		So it won't boot the kernel.
2006-09-12T16:04:00.000Z	theBeno		I'll be back if I have more questions. :P
2006-09-12T07:09:00.000Z	theBeno		apt-get install lilo can't find the package.
2006-09-12T07:11:00.000Z	theBeno		Can someone see if they can access package lilo?
2006-09-12T07:12:00.000Z	eyequeue	theBeno	i'll be installing it soon, if you can wait
2006-09-12T07:12:00.000Z	theBeno	eyequeue	cause I need to replace grub with lilo.
2006-09-12T07:12:00.000Z	eyequeue	theBeno	i have to wait for this server to finish the current apt-get run first
2006-09-12T07:13:00.000Z	theBeno	eyequeue	What ubuntu version do you have?
2006-09-12T07:14:00.000Z	eyequeue	theBeno	it's a slow machine, but alphabetically it's up to Preparing to replace suck 4.3.2-4 (using .../archives/suck_4.3.2-4_i386.deb) ...
2006-09-12T07:17:00.000Z	theBeno	eyequeue	ok... I know what repositories are...
2006-09-12T07:18:00.000Z	eyequeue	theBeno	it turns out lilo is in main anyway, no need for other repos
2006-09-12T07:18:00.000Z	theBeno	eyequeue	so how can I install lilo?
2006-09-12T07:19:00.000Z	eyequeue	theBeno	you could manually d/l it ... look in your favorite mirror, then  pool/main/l/lilo/lilo_22.6.1-7ubuntu2_i386.deb
2006-09-12T07:20:00.000Z	eyequeue	theBeno	no prob
2006-09-12T07:20:00.000Z	theBeno	eyequeue	is it ok that I uninstall grub via aot-get remove?  Should I have used the GUI?
2006-09-12T07:21:00.000Z	eyequeue	theBeno	sudo dpkg -i foo.deb to install it, with that filename of course
2006-09-12T07:21:00.000Z	eyequeue	theBeno	any remove should nave the same result, gui is not needed :)
2006-09-12T07:21:00.000Z	theBeno	eyequeue	sweet, thanks. :)
