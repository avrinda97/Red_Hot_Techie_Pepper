2011-12-24T19:43:00.000Z	z3ro3x		In the process of setting up Postfix I learned that my ISP blocks outgoing port 25.  I'm able to receive mail just fine via port 587.  I'm a noob when it comes to Postfix.  Is it necessary for it to be able to connect to port 25 or can I change that outgoing port to 587?
2011-12-24T19:43:00.000Z	Resistance	z3ro3x	 your ISP will likely block any outbound mail protocols, regardless of port...
2011-12-24T19:44:00.000Z	Resistance	z3ro3x	 for any *stable* mail server, you should use 25 for the mail port, and 587 for receiving mail
2011-12-24T19:44:00.000Z	z3ro3x	Resistance	I asked them (at&t) in a live chat and they told me port 25 was the on one being blocked.
2011-12-24T19:45:00.000Z	Resistance	z3ro3x	 i was unaware they still provide non-wireless internet services
2011-12-24T19:46:00.000Z	z3ro3x	Resistance	In the Austin Texas area they provide DSL.
2011-12-24T19:46:00.000Z	Resistance	z3ro3x	 you could always use a gmail account or something to send mail, and depending on what is using postfix, that should fix the mail-sending issue...
2011-12-24T19:48:00.000Z	z3ro3x	Resistance	That's what I do.  I was setting up a mail server really for educational purposes so if I ever had to role out my own email I could.  It's a non issue I was just annoyed they where even blocking that.  But it's understandable why they want to stop spam being most customers are none IT people and a lot of them are infected spam bots.
2011-12-24T19:48:00.000Z	Resistance	z3ro3x	 residential ISPs do that
2011-12-24T19:49:00.000Z	z3ro3x	Resistance	She wanted me to upgrade to a business account to unblock the port.  I was like, thanks but no thanks.
2011-12-24T19:49:00.000Z	Resistance	z3ro3x	 that's really the only way to unblock that port, for *any* residential provider
2011-12-24T19:52:00.000Z	z3ro3x	Resistance	So from I understand is that for SMTP mail servers to function they all have to making outgoing port 25 connections to communicate to each other regardless if you're using SSL/TLS and that's pretty much the standard workings of SMTP servers?
2011-12-24T19:52:00.000Z	Resistance	z3ro3x	 standard workings
2011-12-24T19:54:00.000Z	z3ro3x	Resistance	So when one mail server relays email to another email server it's doing it on port 25?  In clear text?  I thought the whole point of using SSL/TLS for the mail server was so no one can sniff the traffic and read your email.
2011-12-24T19:55:00.000Z	Resistance	z3ro3x	 its using port 25, as for SSL/TLS, its probably using another port encrypted
2011-12-24T19:55:00.000Z	Resistance	z3ro3x	 since you're delving into server jargon and confusing your concepts...
2011-12-24T19:57:00.000Z	Resistance	z3ro3x	 don't assume i know the inner workings of postfix.  But usually it won't send SSL/TLS'd stuff via plaintext
2011-12-24T19:57:00.000Z	Resistance	z3ro3x	 the people who are definitely more knowledgeable might be in #ubuntu-server, or you can wait here for one of their people to answer you in better detail
