2007-05-08T11:26:00.000Z	Henica		okay, I need help now. xD
2007-05-08T11:26:00.000Z	Henica		"apm: BIOS not found"
2007-05-08T11:27:00.000Z	Henica		I just installed Ubuntu 5.10 - And it loaded and said - [4295321.932000]  apm: BIOS not found - Help?
2007-05-08T11:28:00.000Z	crdlb	Henica	5.10? are you sure?
2007-05-08T11:28:00.000Z	Henica		*nods* Old CD, crdlb
2007-05-08T11:28:00.000Z	crdlb	Henica	install a newer version
2007-05-08T11:28:00.000Z	crdlb		breezy is unsupported
2007-05-08T11:28:00.000Z	Henica		I was going to upgrade once I got this working on the net, crdlb
2007-05-08T11:29:00.000Z	crdlb	Henica	it's a long upgrade path to feisty
2007-05-08T11:29:00.000Z	Henica		crdld, I need this PC to work in about 6 hours. What would you suggest?
2007-05-08T11:30:00.000Z	crdlb	Henica	how fast is your net connection?
2007-05-08T11:30:00.000Z	Henica	crdlb	Not that fast, plus, I don't think I can burn a CD on my desktop.
2007-05-08T11:30:00.000Z	Henica		(If that's what you were going for.)
2007-05-08T11:31:00.000Z	crdlb	Henica	it is indeed
2007-05-08T11:31:00.000Z	crdlb		I certainly have no idea why breezy might be broken
2007-05-08T11:31:00.000Z	Henica	crdlb	perhaps I can make this work and then use another work computer to burn it. But I need this to work tonight.
2007-05-08T11:34:00.000Z	Henica	crdlb	is there any way to make 5.10 work so I can have this for work in the morning, or am I screwed?
2007-05-08T11:34:00.000Z	crdlb	Henica	I don't have a clue, I didn't use ubuntu until dapper because I thought it was terrible
