2011-08-20T07:40:00.000Z	mukti		Is there something I need to enable? It doesn't seem like I can install anything using apt...
2011-08-20T07:40:00.000Z	rumpe1	mukti	whats the exact command you used for apt-get?
2011-08-20T07:41:00.000Z	mukti		sudo apt-get install vim
2011-08-20T07:41:00.000Z	rumpe1	mukti	You perhaps need a "sudo apt-get update"
2011-08-20T07:42:00.000Z	mukti	rumpe1	Will that just update the sources, or does it do all system updates?
2011-08-20T07:42:00.000Z	rumpe1	mukti	just the sources
2011-08-20T07:43:00.000Z	mukti		And all that does is update/upgrade sources?
2011-08-20T07:44:00.000Z	mukti		So, everything that needs to be updated will be updated?
2011-08-20T07:44:00.000Z	rumpe1	mukti	update=get fresh infos, upgrade=update applications ... it's a bit confusing
2011-08-20T07:44:00.000Z	mukti		Okay, I understand
2011-08-20T07:45:00.000Z	mukti		It's probably going to take a while since its 10.10
2011-08-20T07:46:00.000Z	mukti		So will this do the same thing as the update manager?
2011-08-20T07:47:00.000Z	rumpe1	mukti	"apt-get update" is really not dangerous at all
2011-08-20T07:47:00.000Z	mukti		But, will this do the same thing as the update manager?
2011-08-20T07:48:00.000Z	rumpe1	mukti	what update-manager?
2011-08-20T07:48:00.000Z	mukti	rumpe1	The GUI application to update your system
2011-08-20T07:49:00.000Z	rumpe1	mukti	they usually also use apt-get, just with eyecandy around it
2011-08-20T07:49:00.000Z	rumpe1	mukti	just do the update :D
