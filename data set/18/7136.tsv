2008-02-02T06:57:00.000Z	MHz128		I'm having trouble installing U7.1. I've got 1 SATA and 1 IDE drives. When I try to manually partition the IDE drive, I get an error message telling me it can't do it. Any ideas???
2008-02-02T06:57:00.000Z	gmcastil	MHz128	what command are you using and what's the error?
2008-02-02T06:58:00.000Z	MHz128	gmcastil	im using the gui install. it doesn't give specific error information
2008-02-02T07:00:00.000Z	gmcastil	MHz128	so, what exactly won't the installer let you do?
2008-02-02T07:00:00.000Z	MHz128	gmcastil	install u7 to the IDE drive with a custom partition
2008-02-02T07:08:00.000Z	MHz128	gmcastil	any ideas?
2008-02-02T07:08:00.000Z	gmcastil	MHz128	need more informtation about your setup - i have no idea what your partition table looks for it
2008-02-02T07:09:00.000Z	MHz128	gmcastil	its a totally blank IDE drive......
2008-02-02T07:10:00.000Z	gmcastil	MHz128	you need to create a partition in the empty space
2008-02-02T07:11:00.000Z	MHz128	gmcastil	thats what im trying to do, but it wont let me
2008-02-02T07:11:00.000Z	gmcastil	MHz128	define "won't let me"
2008-02-02T07:13:00.000Z	MHz128	gmcastil	"can not create partition to IDE"
2008-02-02T07:14:00.000Z	gmcastil	MHz128	i would try using fdisk to see what the partition table actually looks like - pastebin a copy of your partition tables
2008-02-02T07:14:00.000Z	MHz128	gmcastil	should i just reformat the drive and try again?
2008-02-02T07:15:00.000Z	gmcastil	MHz128	yeah, that's what i'd do...but, if it's empty, its not formatted yet
2008-02-02T07:16:00.000Z	MHz128	gmcastil	what filesystem should I format it to?
2008-02-02T07:16:00.000Z	gmcastil	MHz128	ext3
