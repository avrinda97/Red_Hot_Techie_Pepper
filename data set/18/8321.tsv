2007-09-04T13:33:00.000Z	robbster3		hey alll.I've completely broken my system and need some dpkg expert to help me put it back together....
2007-09-04T13:34:00.000Z	robbster3		I wanted to re=install over an existingin installation and it failed. Now my dpkg lists a whole lot of packages that fail configure. any help?
2007-09-04T13:34:00.000Z	nbkr	robbster3	try "sudo dpkg --configure -a" that will reconfigure all not configured packages.
2007-09-04T13:37:00.000Z	robbster3	nbkr	dpkg --configure fails with de[endency issues?
2007-09-04T13:38:00.000Z	nbkr	robbster3	try "sudo apt-get -f install"
2007-09-04T13:38:00.000Z	robbster3	nbkr	same issue.
2007-09-04T13:38:00.000Z	robbster3	nbkr	it is the base -[ackages that are the issue... :(
2007-09-04T13:39:00.000Z	nbkr	robbster3	Did you edit /etc/apt/sources.list ?
2007-09-04T13:39:00.000Z	robbster3		no
2007-09-04T13:39:00.000Z	robbster3		still points to the cdrom only ...
2007-09-04T13:39:00.000Z	nbkr	robbster3	so what did you do?
2007-09-04T13:40:00.000Z	robbster3		I attempted to restore the packages to the initial installed versions.
2007-09-04T13:40:00.000Z	nbkr	robbster3	A downgrade then?
2007-09-04T13:40:00.000Z	robbster3		so I attempted to install over a running system. It failed to configure packages as part of the install...
2007-09-04T13:40:00.000Z	robbster3		.. and now it is broken.
2007-09-04T13:41:00.000Z	robbster3	nbkr	 yeah. a downgrade.
2007-09-04T13:41:00.000Z	nbkr	robbster3	Hm, it can probably be fixed manually, but I think it is faster to reinstall the system from scratch.
2007-09-04T13:42:00.000Z	robbster3	nbkr	and the package selection?
