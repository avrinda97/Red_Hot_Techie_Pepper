2009-04-25T06:48:00.000Z	NOD62		I'm upgrading from 8.10 to 9.04..... It's been "Getting new packages" for 4 hours now... it hasn't moved from Fetching file 1102 of 1232... Does anyone have an idea of why this might be?
2009-04-25T06:48:00.000Z	gm|lap	NOD62	it could be openoffice
2009-04-25T06:49:00.000Z	NOD62	gm|lap	I haven't opened openoffice?
2009-04-25T06:49:00.000Z	gm|lap	NOD62	i mean it could be downloading it
2009-04-25T06:50:00.000Z	NOD62	gm|lap	Well, I already have it, and i don't know why it would take 4 hours to download openoffice. >_> I think the other guy had a morel likely choice...
2009-04-25T06:50:00.000Z	gm|lap	NOD62	the thing is, openoffice is pretty huge... are you sure you have the updated version of openoffice or just the one which came with it?
2009-04-25T06:51:00.000Z	NOD62	gm|lap	The one that came with it, I haven't updated it.
2009-04-25T06:52:00.000Z	NOD62	gm|lap	So you're suggesting that this open office update is causing what appears to be a freeze up during the upgrade?
2009-04-25T06:52:00.000Z	gm|lap	NOD62	i'm not saying it's frozen, i'm saying it's still downloading it...
2009-04-25T07:04:00.000Z	NOD62	gm|lap	Why's that?
2009-04-25T07:04:00.000Z	gm|lap	NOD62	not much bandwidth
2009-04-25T07:34:00.000Z	NOD62	gm|lap	One hour later, and still in the same spot... 5 hours in the same spot.
2009-04-25T07:34:00.000Z	gm|lap	NOD62	ouch.
2009-04-25T07:34:00.000Z	gm|lap	NOD62	what are you using to update ubuntu?
2009-04-25T07:34:00.000Z	NOD62	gm|lap	the update-manager.
2009-04-25T07:37:00.000Z	NOD62	gm|lap	Update-manger is the way to do it, correct?
2009-04-25T07:37:00.000Z	gm|lap	NOD62	i'm not familiar with it.
