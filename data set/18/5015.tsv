2008-12-31T01:22:00.000Z	wasert		hi I'm trying to program a system shutdown
2008-12-31T01:22:00.000Z	wasert		I'm using at
2008-12-31T01:22:00.000Z	wasert		but it does not seem to work
2008-12-31T01:23:00.000Z	wasert		no, I'm typing for example:
2008-12-31T01:23:00.000Z	wasert		at 4:00pm Dec 30
2008-12-31T01:23:00.000Z	wasert		then I type
2008-12-31T01:23:00.000Z	wasert		sudo shutdown -h now
2008-12-31T01:23:00.000Z	wasert		my password
2008-12-31T01:23:00.000Z	wasert		then Ctrl+D
2008-12-31T01:24:00.000Z	wasert		and I get: job 9 at Tue Dec 30 15:20:00 2008
2008-12-31T01:24:00.000Z	nDuff	wasert	is atd running?
2008-12-31T01:25:00.000Z	wasert	nDuff	I don't know. I tried to do some tests and for example try: sudo apt-get update > file.txt . The file is created but blank
2008-12-31T01:25:00.000Z	nDuff	wasert	if it's running, did it send you an email with the task output?
2008-12-31T01:25:00.000Z	nDuff	wasert	if you want your at job to run as root, you should run "sudo at", not put the sudo inside the at job.
2008-12-31T01:26:00.000Z	wasert	nDuff	I can see this in /var/log/syslog: Dec 30 15:20:02 jelly atd[10701]: Exec failed for mail command: No such file or directory
2008-12-31T01:26:00.000Z	nDuff	wasert	ahh; that's why you aren't getting failure reports
2008-12-31T01:28:00.000Z	nDuff	wasert	install mailx or such.
2008-12-31T01:30:00.000Z	wasert	nDuff	Thank you I tried with sudo at, and It worked.
