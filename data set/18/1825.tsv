2010-10-28T07:53:00.000Z	Digital_838		Anyone know when the 2.6.36 kernel will hit the updates for Maverick?
2010-10-28T07:54:00.000Z	psusi	Digital_838	it won't
2010-10-28T07:54:00.000Z	Digital_838	psusi	 Why not?
2010-10-28T07:54:00.000Z	Digital_838		http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v2.6.36-rc8-maverick/
2010-10-28T07:55:00.000Z	Digital_838		What are those for?
2010-10-28T07:55:00.000Z	psusi	Digital_838	because -updates is for service releases to fix critical bugs
2010-10-28T07:55:00.000Z	psusi	Digital_838	testing
2010-10-28T07:55:00.000Z	Digital_838	psusi	 But even with testing they won't move it into the updates?
2010-10-28T07:55:00.000Z	Digital_838	psusi	 I mean after done testing.
2010-10-28T07:56:00.000Z	Digital_838		Well that really stinks  because the 2.6.35 kernel is laggy and sluggish for a lot of folks.
2010-10-28T07:56:00.000Z	Digital_838		I wish for the 2.6.35 kernel to go away.
2010-10-28T07:57:00.000Z	Digital_838		There's a huge thread in the forums of people having issues with this 2.6.35 kernels and the 2.6.36 kernel makes all those issues disappear.
2010-10-28T07:58:00.000Z	Digital_838		stiltzin you should try the 2.6.36 kernel.
2010-10-28T07:58:00.000Z	Digital_838		Really its loads better
2010-10-28T07:58:00.000Z	Digital_838		You load 3 debs and Maverick gets wings!

2010-10-28T07:58:00.000Z	psusi	Digital_838	no... stable releases only get bug fixes, not new versions just because they are there...
