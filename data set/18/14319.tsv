2005-12-18T16:54:00.000Z	dooglus	kameron	I was looking for opinions as to a bug: http://bugzilla.ubuntu.com/show_bug.cgi?id=19108
2005-12-18T16:54:00.000Z	dooglus	kameron	who's right?
2005-12-18T16:55:00.000Z	kameron	dooglus	ill check it out
2005-12-18T16:56:00.000Z	kameron	dooglus	i'm not sure, i'm not on my ubuntu box right now, i'll check it out later
2005-12-18T16:56:00.000Z	dooglus	kameron	the dispute is over whether "a -> b" is a link to 'a' or to 'b'
2005-12-18T16:57:00.000Z	kameron	dooglus	ln a b would make b a link to a, it is backwards
2005-12-18T16:57:00.000Z	kameron	dooglus	but i don't know what it is in the man page.
2005-12-18T16:58:00.000Z	dooglus	kameron	and "ls -l" would show it as "b -> a"
2005-12-18T16:58:00.000Z	kameron	dooglus	correct, but i'm going from memory
2005-12-18T16:58:00.000Z	dooglus	kameron	the man page says: ln [OPTION] ... TARGET [LINK_NAME]  : Create a link to the specified TARGET with optional LINK_NAME.
2005-12-18T16:59:00.000Z	kameron	dooglus	it appears the man is incorrect.
2005-12-18T16:59:00.000Z	dooglus	kameron	really?
2005-12-18T17:00:00.000Z	kameron	dooglus	i think so. ah, let me read over it again. this is one of the most baffling parts of unix though.
2005-12-19T17:01:00.000Z	kameron	dooglus	it looks backwards to me
2005-12-19T17:01:00.000Z	dooglus	kameron	you said "ln a b would make b link to a".  that's the same as the man page is saying, just replace 'a' with TARGET and 'b' with LINK_NAME
2006-02-22T15:39:00.000Z	dooglus	kameron	try "sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart" from there
2007-02-13T13:31:00.000Z	dooglus	kameron	it's often called 'cable select'
