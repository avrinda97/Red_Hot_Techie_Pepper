2007-09-28T05:02:00.000Z	_SiLENT_		is there an antivirus for Linux?
2007-09-28T05:02:00.000Z	Downix	_SiLENT_	There are Viruse for Linux?  8)
2007-09-28T05:06:00.000Z	Downix	_SiLENT_	Far more functionality..
2007-09-28T05:13:00.000Z	Downix	_SiLENT_	Yes, but why would you want to?
2007-09-28T05:13:00.000Z	_SiLENT_	Downix	the activeX support that I need, is it available in Ubuntu without IE?
2007-09-28T05:14:00.000Z	Downix	_SiLENT_	Pardon, but ActiveX has nothing to do with IE
2007-09-28T05:15:00.000Z	_SiLENT_	Downix	so is it available or not? I use an e-money system that needs it to login...
2007-09-28T05:15:00.000Z	Downix	_SiLENT_	ActiveX is Microsoft's replacement for COM, it's just an object file utilized by the OS itself.  Has absolutely nothing to do with IE.
2007-09-28T05:16:00.000Z	Downix	_SiLENT_	It's not available in any web browser, IE included, because it has nothing to do with web browsing
2007-09-28T05:16:00.000Z	Downix	_SiLENT_	Would be akin to discussing car repair and you asking if you needed sugar and flower
2007-09-28T05:17:00.000Z	Downix	_SiLENT_	Which e-money system, and I'll check.
2007-09-28T05:18:00.000Z	Downix	_SiLENT_	can you login with firefox?
2007-09-28T05:19:00.000Z	Downix	_SiLENT_	No, it's mozilla-based.  But if you absolutely need IE, yes it does run.
2007-09-28T05:21:00.000Z	Downix	_SiLENT_	IE is rather....  antiquated in the computing world.  Doesn't even support PNG files properly.
2007-09-28T05:21:00.000Z	_SiLENT_	Downix	how come it doesn't support png? the animated ones?
2007-09-28T05:22:00.000Z	Downix	_SiLENT_	You'd have to ask Microsoft.  IE however is one of the worst display engines I've delt with outside of an Amiga's web browser
2007-09-28T05:22:00.000Z	_SiLENT_	Downix	this e-money system -> www.webmoney.ru
2007-09-28T05:22:00.000Z	Downix	_SiLENT_	Yup
