2011-07-28T23:23:00.000Z	Bigbucks		pici: I dont think the BIOS has an option to disable them, I am planning on using this as a small file server, because the computer is basically useless as a homecomputer, and what is RMMOD?
2011-07-28T23:24:00.000Z	edbian	Bigbucks	rmmod removes a module.  modules are drivers in linux.  If you remove a driver it will not be used for any device on your system.
2011-07-28T23:25:00.000Z	Bigbucks	edbian	So, say I could remove the harddrive from the computer with the busted USB, and plug it into a working computer, disable the USB drivers, then plug it back in, and I should not recieve the error?
2011-07-28T23:26:00.000Z	edbian	Bigbucks	well rmmod does not survive a reboot.
2011-07-28T23:26:00.000Z	edbian	Bigbucks	Additionally, you're assuming the module is causing the problem :/
2011-07-28T23:28:00.000Z	Bigbucks	edbian	Pici: The USB hasnt worked for a while, even when it was running windows. It is a problem with the computer. I want to stop the message so I can use basic functionality required for the server. I will have no need for USB.
2011-07-28T23:28:00.000Z	edbian	Bigbucks	It sounds to me like something is wrong with the actual hardware if it effects multiple OSs.  Can you boot Ubuntu and remove the modules for USB manually?
2011-07-28T23:28:00.000Z	edbian	Bigbucks	do what Pici says :)
2011-07-28T23:30:00.000Z	edbian	Bigbucks	it tells you the names of the modules that have 'usb' in the name.
2011-07-28T23:31:00.000Z	Bigbucks	edbian	So is there a way to remove the modules while still being able to reboot the machine without the error?
2011-07-28T23:32:00.000Z	edbian	Bigbucks	I don't think so because the USB modules are part of the kernel.  You'd have to compile the kernel yourself and not include them.  If you can boot Ubuntu and turn the modules off manually then there is a way to have the automatically turned off at boot time for you.
2011-07-28T23:33:00.000Z	Bigbucks	edbian	Would blacklisting them cause them not to be started when ubuntu server is loaded?
2011-07-28T23:33:00.000Z	edbian	Bigbucks	yes
2011-07-28T23:34:00.000Z	edbian	Bigbucks	I believe so.  I was wrong before.  blacklisting will prevent them ever being loaded.
2011-07-28T23:34:00.000Z	edbian	Bigbucks	to blacklist modules you put blacklist <mod Name> in /etc/blacklist.conf  (I think that's the file)
2011-07-28T23:34:00.000Z	Bigbucks	edbian	So, I could blacklist anything with USB in the name, and it would prevent the error from appearing?
2011-07-28T23:35:00.000Z	edbian	Bigbucks	It is a possible solution.  You cannot blacklist wildcards though.  You have to figure out the exact names using lsmod and google :)
2011-07-28T23:36:00.000Z	Bigbucks	edbian	So just lsmod for anything with USB in the name, then blacklist them all?
