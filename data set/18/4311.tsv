2010-09-28T14:07:00.000Z	iceroot	DjAngo23	nfvs4 can do user-authentication
2010-09-28T14:11:00.000Z	iceroot	DjAngo23	the problem is that nfs is only using uids, so if you create a file belonging to root (uid=1??) then any other root (also have uid=1) is owner of the file
2010-09-28T14:12:00.000Z	DjAngo23	iceroot	okaym, i understand bit more now.
2010-09-28T14:18:00.000Z	iceroot	DjAngo23	nfsv4 is recognising the user
2010-09-28T14:18:00.000Z	iceroot	DjAngo23	i dont know if ubuntu has nfsv4
