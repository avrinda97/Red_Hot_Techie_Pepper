2007-09-26T09:31:00.000Z	pigcum		i have a problem here
2007-09-26T09:32:00.000Z	pigcum		so i installed google earth and i did 'sudo apt-get install googleearth-package' but when i try to start google earth with the command 'googleearth' my screen goes blank and then it kicks me out of the GUI so i have to login again
2007-09-26T09:32:00.000Z	pigcum		any ideas?
2007-09-26T09:34:00.000Z	predaeus	pigcum	did you enable the restricted drivers in the restricted-drivers manager?
2007-09-26T09:33:00.000Z	predaeus	pigcum	sounds like it crashes the X server. what graphics card do you have?
2007-09-26T09:34:00.000Z	pigcum	predaeus	i have a nvidia agp 6200 256 ddr2 64bit
2007-09-26T09:34:00.000Z	pigcum	predaeus	no sir! how do i do that?
2007-09-26T09:36:00.000Z	predaeus	pigcum	run the restriced-manager either by choosing it from the menu or running "sudo restricted-manager" in a terminal/console. Then tick the nvidia restricted drivers and restart.
2007-09-26T09:36:00.000Z	pigcum	predaeus	ok one moment sir!
2007-09-26T09:37:00.000Z	predaeus	pigcum	the point is Ubuntu can not enable those drivers for legal reasons, so users have to do that themselves.
2007-09-26T09:38:00.000Z	pigcum	predaeus	is it that fascist microsoft who has done that shit?
2007-09-26T09:38:00.000Z	predaeus	pigcum	please watch your language, we are trying to keep the channel family friendly.
2007-09-26T09:38:00.000Z	predaeus	pigcum	and no, it is due to legal reasons with GPL and linux I think.
2007-09-26T09:38:00.000Z	pigcum	predaeus	anyway i enabled it and i need to retart my system now. ill brb...
2007-09-26T09:53:00.000Z	predaeus	pigcum	if you don't know the name or only part of it try e.g. "google<tab>" to get a list for autocompletion.
