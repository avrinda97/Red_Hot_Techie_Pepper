2010-06-12T01:05:00.000Z	woodworks		i see helpers asking all the time "did you do an upgrade or fresh install?", is an upgrade not a good option? I have dial-up and downloading an ISO is a two day affair...
2010-06-12T01:06:00.000Z	misse-	woodworks	my experience is that it depends on how much you've "tweaked" your install. a default install upgrades just fine mostly
2010-06-12T01:06:00.000Z	woodworks	misse-	ah, that makes sense, was wondering why there would be upgrade if its not recommended
2010-06-12T01:06:00.000Z	misse-	woodworks	isn't an online upgrade over dial-up just as timeconsuming? I would prefer a one-time download that can be reused
2010-06-12T01:07:00.000Z	woodworks	misse-	don't know about timing yet, just getting prepared, upgrading to dedicated line next week (high speed not available in my area)
2010-06-12T01:08:00.000Z	misse-	woodworks	for me; I usually save my settings for apps which I edit the config for a lot and then do a fresh install (leaving my data-partition intact of course)
2010-06-12T01:08:00.000Z	misse-	woodworks	that's too bad with your connection and all, where're you from?
2010-06-12T01:08:00.000Z	woodworks	misse-	kentucky hills
2010-06-12T01:09:00.000Z	misse-	woodworks	uhm, kentucky as in U.S.?
2010-06-12T01:10:00.000Z	woodworks	misse-	yep, cell phone is still 2g, copper based tele lines, sat is only hi speed option
2010-06-12T01:11:00.000Z	misse-	woodworks	wow :/ I live in sweden. Grew up in a town of 10.000 people. got ADSL in like.. 99-00
2010-06-12T01:11:00.000Z	misse-	woodworks	and now they're installing a MAN in my mothers house
2010-06-12T01:13:00.000Z	woodworks	misse-	well, its wierd 1/2 mile away is fiber optic cable, but we are on a spur road and no plans by phone company to upgrade for at least 6 months, closest town is 12 miles away
2010-06-12T01:14:00.000Z	misse-	woodworks	half a mile? Sounds like someone might be able to solder on a cable of his own and draw the fibre along the powerlines :P
2010-06-12T01:19:00.000Z	woodworks	misse-	i contacted them about running fibe, even volunteered to do the install, they were gonna go for it then said it would cost me $4,000 USD for materials
2010-06-12T01:20:00.000Z	misse-	woodworks	for materials? how can half a mile of fibre cable and 2 connectors cost that much?
2010-06-12T01:20:00.000Z	woodworks	misse-	i think i was being blown off actually
2010-06-12T01:21:00.000Z	misse-	woodworks	yeah sounds like it.. my mom's paying about 3000$ for the install including materials and installation. She has to prepare a cable channel from the road to the house (5 meters)
