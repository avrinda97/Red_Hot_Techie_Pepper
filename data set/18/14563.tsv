2005-07-12T05:59:00.000Z	jtan325__		ok cool cool
2005-07-12T05:59:00.000Z	Gerrath	jtan325__	you can set it up in the config script /etc/ssh/sshd_config
2005-07-12T06:00:00.000Z	Gerrath	jtan325__	if you want it to be able to do it automatically.
2005-07-12T06:00:00.000Z	jtan325__	Gerrath	what option?
2005-07-12T06:01:00.000Z	Gerrath	jtan325__	I believe it is "X11Forwarding yes
2005-07-12T06:03:00.000Z	jtan325__	Gerrath	that option is enabled by default in sshd_config i think
2005-07-12T06:03:00.000Z	Gerrath	jtan325__	Read what nikkia wrote..
2005-07-12T06:03:00.000Z	Gerrath	jtan325__	I think I miss understood your question.
2005-07-12T06:04:00.000Z	Gerrath	jtan325__	anyway you can do a man ssh_config and get all the info on it.
