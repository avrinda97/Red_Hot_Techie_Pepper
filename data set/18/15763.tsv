2005-01-31T17:19:00.000Z	cafuego	adam_	Works fine (default setup) on my 5700
2005-08-30T05:46:00.000Z	cafuego	adam_	october
2006-03-20T06:25:00.000Z	cafuego	adam_	/var/cache/apt/archives
2006-03-20T06:26:00.000Z	cafuego	adam_	Of course, you could run 'dpkg -i <package list>' as well.
2006-03-20T06:26:00.000Z	adam_	cafuego	though I get dependency problems when I do that
2006-03-20T06:26:00.000Z	cafuego	adam_	Did you download the *correct* OOo packages?
2006-03-20T06:27:00.000Z	adam_	cafuego	depends on what you mean by "correct" I downloaded the OpenOffice 2 final release packages made by doko
2006-03-20T06:27:00.000Z	cafuego	adam_	Are they designed for your specific ubuntu release?
2006-03-20T06:28:00.000Z	adam_	cafuego	is "breezy" 5.04?
2006-03-20T06:28:00.000Z	cafuego	adam_	no, breezy is 5.10. 5.04 is hoary.
2006-03-20T06:28:00.000Z	adam_	cafuego	oh
2006-03-20T06:28:00.000Z	adam_	cafuego	I suppose this is why they aren't working :)
2006-03-20T06:29:00.000Z	cafuego	adam_	If you have packages for breezy, they won't work.
2006-03-20T06:29:00.000Z	adam_	cafuego	how would I upgrade to breezy? I'm on dialup -- my friends has 5.10 cds, should I just get a cd from him and upgrade somehow?
2006-03-20T06:29:00.000Z	cafuego	adam_	Yes, get a CD, insert, click 'Upgrade' (I think)
2006-03-20T06:30:00.000Z	adam_	cafuego	:)
2006-03-20T06:34:00.000Z	adam_	cafuego	_jason, crimsun, etc: thanks for the help, I'll get the CD from my friend tomorrow and then upgrade and hopefully these packages will work then :)
