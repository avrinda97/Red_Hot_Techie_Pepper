2005-10-04T16:30:00.000Z	absenth		for general desktop use, which file system has better overall performance, ReiserFS, or Ext3
2005-10-04T16:31:00.000Z	ccooke	absenth	reiser is faster in some cases. But I've found it to be markedly less reliable than ext2/3
2005-10-04T16:31:00.000Z	absenth	ccooke	less reliable in what sense?  not trying to nitpick, just trying to learn, and understand more.
2005-10-04T16:32:00.000Z	ccooke	absenth	we have a couple of terabyte storage servers at work - two different ones, with different stuff installed, but both running reiserfs.
2005-10-04T16:33:00.000Z	ccooke	absenth	every three or four months on average, one of them will develop random filesystem corruption and need to be brought down to maintenance mode for fsck.
2005-10-04T16:33:00.000Z	absenth	ccooke	so they loose data more frequently, or require file system checks more often then Ext2,3.  Now that makes perfect sense.  thank you for the explination.
2005-10-04T16:33:00.000Z	ccooke	absenth	now, we've not yet lost anyting important, but...
2005-10-04T16:34:00.000Z	absenth	ccooke	on the laptop I'm less worried about it, as there isn't anything terribly important.  but I could see having to perform maint. on the file system as a PITA
2005-10-04T16:34:00.000Z	ccooke	absenth	generally, you're better off using ext2/3
2005-10-04T16:35:00.000Z	ccooke	absenth	unless you have an actual use case for speed.
2005-10-04T16:35:00.000Z	ccooke	absenth	I'd happily use resierfs for a news spool - after all, reiser makes a huge speed increase there and who cares if it fails...
2005-10-04T16:35:00.000Z	ccooke		but for my root or home partitions? forget it.
2005-10-04T16:35:00.000Z	absenth	ccooke	between Ext2 and Ext3 the major change is journaling correct?  On the laptop I'd bet Ext2 is a better choice as it would/might hit the drive less frequently.
2005-10-04T16:36:00.000Z	ccooke	absenth	ext3 is almost always a better choice. It *is* very slightly slower, mind, but it's very, very solid.
2005-10-04T16:36:00.000Z	ccooke		anyway. Sleep.
2005-10-04T16:37:00.000Z	absenth	ccooke	thanks for the brief, but useful lesson in file systems :)
2005-10-04T16:38:00.000Z	absenth	ccooke	the best part is I feel like I got a good, solid, technical answer to my question, rather then the typical Fanboy crap I've been reading on a bunch of sites.
2005-10-04T16:38:00.000Z	ccooke	absenth	Glad I could help :-)
