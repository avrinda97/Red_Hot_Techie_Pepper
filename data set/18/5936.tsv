2008-07-29T20:30:00.000Z	lore20__	Jan|	I have, why?
2008-07-29T20:31:00.000Z	Jan|	lore20__	I test the disk integrity (before installing) and every time it seems to have bad files....
2008-07-29T20:31:00.000Z	lore20__	Jan|	and with 32bit version?
2008-07-29T20:31:00.000Z	Jan|	lore20__	haven't tried yet
2008-07-29T20:32:00.000Z	lore20__	Jan|	I think is not a 64bit version problem
2008-07-29T20:32:00.000Z	Jan|	lore20__	I want the 64bit to run but if it can't....
2008-07-29T20:32:00.000Z	Jan|	lore20__	I can't burn lower than 4x
2008-07-29T20:32:00.000Z	Jan|	lore20__	no I checked the md5 and its ok
2008-07-29T20:33:00.000Z	Jan|	lore20__	for the ISO atleast
2008-07-29T20:33:00.000Z	lore20__	Jan|	have you try with another CD?
2008-07-29T20:34:00.000Z	Jan|	lore20__	yes, I burned 3 of them at the lowest speed possible and the integrity check says all 3 have errors
2008-07-29T20:35:00.000Z	lore20__	Jan|	if you try to continue installation?
2008-07-29T20:36:00.000Z	Jan|	lore20__	if I try the install the loading screen just freezes afters a minute or so
2008-07-29T20:37:00.000Z	lore20__	Jan|	you could try with another cd-drive or with an usb drive
2008-07-29T20:47:00.000Z	Jan|	lore20__	so I checked the md5 AGAIN with torrenting and it passed...
2008-07-29T20:48:00.000Z	Jan|	lore20__	I updated the firmware of the optical drive, maybe it'll help
2008-07-29T20:49:00.000Z	lore20__	Jan|	it may be a cd reader/burner problem
