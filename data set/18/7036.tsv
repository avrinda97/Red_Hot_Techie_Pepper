2011-03-24T04:25:00.000Z	Docfxit		Are there temp files I can remove in Ubuntu?
2011-03-24T04:25:00.000Z	Quintin	Docfxit	yes, but why would you want to?
2011-03-24T04:26:00.000Z	Docfxit	Quintin	I think I'm out of space.
2011-03-24T04:26:00.000Z	Quintin	Docfxit	think?  try df -h at a terminal window, or use that disk-free thingie under accessories
2011-03-24T04:28:00.000Z	Docfxit	Quintin	I think this is where my problem is /dev/sda2 5.6G 5.4G 0 = Available
2011-03-24T04:29:00.000Z	Quintin	Docfxit	ok, where is that mounted?
2011-03-24T04:29:00.000Z	Docfxit	Quintin	It's mounted during boot up.
2011-03-24T04:30:00.000Z	Quintin	Docfxit	no kidding?  mounted _where_ though?
2011-03-24T04:30:00.000Z	Docfxit	Quintin	I don't know how to answer your question.
2011-03-24T04:31:00.000Z	Quintin	Docfxit	when you type df -h , it shows the mount point!  "Mounted on:"
2011-03-24T04:32:00.000Z	Docfxit	Quintin	Sorry. It's mounted on /
2011-03-24T04:32:00.000Z	Quintin	Docfxit	ok, try aptitude clean, then consider removing large packages
2011-03-24T04:33:00.000Z	Docfxit	Quintin	I do have plenty of room on another partition but I'm working on it remotely.
2011-03-24T04:34:00.000Z	Quintin	Docfxit	no reason you can't do what I suggested remotely.  also, dpkg-query -Wf '${Installed-Size}\t${Package}\n' | sort -n  will list packages by size
2011-03-24T04:45:00.000Z	Docfxit	Quintin	I have removed a few applications including all games. Nothing seems to make any room. Available is still zero.
2011-03-24T04:46:00.000Z	Quintin	Docfxit	did you do `aptitude clean' ?
2011-03-24T04:48:00.000Z	Docfxit	Quintin	yes. That looked like it ran but didn't seem to free up any space. I'll run it again.
2011-03-24T04:49:00.000Z	Docfxit	Quintin	After running it again it still shows Zero available
