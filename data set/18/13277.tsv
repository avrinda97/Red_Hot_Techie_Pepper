2005-12-22T13:40:00.000Z	jnk	corresponder	well first make a new one, and put it in all groups were the first one is (use "groups oldusername", and "adduser newusername groupname") then delete the old one

2005-12-22T13:42:00.000Z	corresponder		ah ,k
2005-12-22T13:42:00.000Z	corresponder		cause my "new" user exists at all
2005-12-22T13:43:00.000Z	jnk	corresponder	but first you must create a new user right
2005-12-22T13:44:00.000Z	corresponder		so i have to delte the existing one?
2005-12-22T13:44:00.000Z	corresponder		the superuser should have the name which one user already has
2005-12-22T13:45:00.000Z	jnk	corresponder	let's say your first user is Alice, and you already have Bob and you want to delete Alice, and make Bob the "first user" ok? (if Bob doesn't exist, just do: adduser Bob)
2005-12-22T13:46:00.000Z	corresponder		k
2005-12-22T13:46:00.000Z	corresponder		he exists
2005-12-22T13:46:00.000Z	corresponder		so i have to modificate him
2005-12-22T13:47:00.000Z	jnk	corresponder	then you'd type "groups Alice" to see what groups you need to add to Bob. See "man groups". Then you must add Bob to those groups with the adduser command. See "man adduser". You can do something nasty like: "for i in `groups Alice`; do adduser Bob $i; done"
