2009-05-29T23:28:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	alienkid10	so something is wrong with you "custom built" cd - can you try the origional cd instead?
2009-05-29T23:30:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	alienkid10	it's actually whatever comes after the output you're giving as Cron ends with OK...
2009-05-29T23:30:00.000Z	alienkid10	ZykoticK9	what?
2009-05-29T23:31:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	alienkid10	you stated "Starting periodic command scheduler crond   [OK]" which tells us the crond started fine...
2009-05-29T23:32:00.000Z	alienkid10	ZykoticK9	oh. I wonder what it trys to do after that
2010-02-13T01:40:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	alienkid10	typically Persistent installs use USB drivers -- you understand that a persistent CD would need some sort of HD storage.
2010-02-13T01:40:00.000Z	alienkid10	ZykoticK9	I am the casper-rw on a USB drive
2010-02-13T01:42:00.000Z	alienkid10	ZykoticK9	I have the casper-rw on a USB drive. Should I install things like display drivers when in persistent?
2010-02-13T01:43:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	alienkid10	i don't know man - i've only ever used the USB creator to create persistent USB keys - no idea how to do it manually
2010-08-05T00:25:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	alienkid10	to find your graphics card you can use "lspci | grep -i vga"
2010-08-05T00:26:00.000Z	alienkid10	ZykoticK9	how can I use that once I have it? Also will that work on a laptop?
2010-08-05T00:26:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	alienkid10	use that in a terminal
2010-08-05T00:27:00.000Z	alienkid10	ZykoticK9	can I set the result as a var then see if it equals something then chosse the right x config
2010-08-05T00:28:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	alienkid10	that will just output what graphics card you have - it won't show you the correct driver or anything - but will allow you to google/post here with your card.
2010-08-05T00:28:00.000Z	alienkid10	ZykoticK9	I'm sorry at an internet cafe and running out of time bye
