2009-06-17T23:20:00.000Z	Pici	oly562	Because they are in the 'restricted' package repository, which holds non-open-sourced software.

2010-06-16T23:38:00.000Z	Pici	oly562	italc seems to be a standard part of the edubuntu tasks, but I don't see that it should have been install with an Ubuntu desktop install.

You could use http://apt.alturl.com/ and tell it you want to install ubuntu-desktop and it will recurse the dependencies and show you everything you need.
