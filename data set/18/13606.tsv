2006-05-19T13:07:00.000Z	kennethlove		anyone: apt-get gives me 404s. even after an update and checking that the sources are correct. ping and torrents are working, just not apt-get.
2006-05-19T13:07:00.000Z	roe	kennethlove	 what package are you are installing
2006-05-19T13:08:00.000Z	kennethlove	roe	any. none of them are coming down
2006-05-19T13:08:00.000Z	roe	kennethlove	 you can do apt-get update?
2006-05-19T13:08:00.000Z	kennethlove	roe	update gets nothing but 404s.
2006-05-19T13:09:00.000Z	roe	kennethlove	 do an apt-get clean
2006-05-19T13:09:00.000Z	kennethlove	roe	ok
2006-05-19T13:09:00.000Z	kennethlove	roe	update still gets 404
2006-05-19T13:11:00.000Z	roe	kennethlove	 does apt-cache searches work?
2006-05-19T13:12:00.000Z	kennethlove	roe	yep
2006-05-19T13:12:00.000Z	roe		was it ever working?
2006-05-19T13:13:00.000Z	kennethlove	roe	apt-get? yeah, it's worked fine up to now (well, one other instance of this, but i can't find my notes on how to fix it)
2006-05-19T13:13:00.000Z	roe		and does synaptics work?
2006-05-19T13:14:00.000Z	kennethlove	roe	 i'm not sure, i'm through an ssh tunnel. :) but, last time, no
2006-05-19T13:14:00.000Z	kennethlove	roe	hold on. i'll try it through vnc
2006-05-19T13:16:00.000Z	roe		can you repost your sources? I am futzing with my xorg.conf so I have no irc history
2006-05-19T13:16:00.000Z	kennethlove	roe	http://rafb.net/paste/results/WcNMgz38.html
