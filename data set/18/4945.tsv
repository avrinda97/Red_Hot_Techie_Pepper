2010-07-31T14:38:00.000Z	chrislabeard		Hey guys are there any good guides to install phpmyadmin?
2010-07-31T14:38:00.000Z	chrislabeard		Linux
2010-07-31T14:39:00.000Z	oCean_	chrislabeard	sudo apt-get install phpmyadmin should be enough (if you did the LAMP packages already)
2010-07-31T15:00:00.000Z	oCean_	chrislabeard	should be owned by the user running that specific process. (for example apache webserver runs user www-data)
2010-07-31T15:01:00.000Z	chrislabeard	oCean_	The directory says its owned by my admin user name "beard' but it still won't allow the server to write to it when trying to install
2010-07-31T15:01:00.000Z	oCean_	chrislabeard	what install are we talking about?
2010-07-31T15:02:00.000Z	chrislabeard	oCean_	Well its wordpress
2010-07-31T15:02:00.000Z	oCean_	chrislabeard	wp is installed through webserver, so the directory where you want to install wp (e.g. /var/www/wordpress) should be owned by www-data, since apache runs under that user
2010-07-31T15:03:00.000Z	oCean_	chrislabeard	same
2010-07-31T15:07:00.000Z	chrislabeard	oCean_	is this wrong ? - chown -R www-data wwmcd
2010-07-31T15:08:00.000Z	oCean_	chrislabeard	should be ok if wwmcd is your wp directory, I would do: "chown -R www-data:www-data wpdir/"
2010-07-31T15:10:00.000Z	chrislabeard	oCean_	can I not go and change the username for the apache user?
2010-07-31T15:11:00.000Z	oCean_	chrislabeard	better not. There is a apache module which will let you run various vhosts under various users, that's a bit complicated. After the chown as I showed, it should work.
2010-07-31T15:11:00.000Z	oCean_	chrislabeard	what does "lsb_release -a" output?
2010-07-31T15:13:00.000Z	chrislabeard	oCean_	Just a second
2010-07-31T15:16:00.000Z	oCean_	chrislabeard	I asked because "invalid argument" is not a chown error msg from ubuntu. It would say "no such user"
2010-07-31T15:16:00.000Z	chrislabeard	oCean_	Yeah I lied I'm not in ubuntu
2010-07-31T15:17:00.000Z	oCean_	chrislabeard	I figured as much. Good luck
