2008-06-14T10:22:00.000Z	matthew_		I just want to access a program that I installed. I don't know where it is because it doesn't show up in the main menu. I just made the switch, and if someone could point me in the right direction I would appreciate it.
2008-06-14T10:22:00.000Z	kbreit	matthew_	What program?
2008-06-14T10:22:00.000Z	kbreit	matthew_	Do you know what the executable name is?
2008-06-14T10:23:00.000Z	matthew_	kbreit	emusic_linux_current.tar.gz is the only name I know of
2008-06-14T10:24:00.000Z	kbreit	matthew_	Did you untar it?
2008-06-14T10:24:00.000Z	matthew_	kbreit	but I already extracted it
2008-06-14T10:24:00.000Z	kbreit	matthew_	Did you install it or just extract?
2008-06-14T10:24:00.000Z	kbreit	matthew_	From the console do a 'which emusic' or something like that.
2008-06-14T10:25:00.000Z	matthew_	kbreit	I'm sorry...console? like..terminal?
2008-06-14T10:26:00.000Z	matthew_	kbreit	that didn't do anything
2008-06-14T10:26:00.000Z	kbreit	matthew_	From the terminal, as root, do an updatedb && locate emusic
2008-06-14T10:29:00.000Z	matthew_	kbreit	I'm sorr I don't know what that means. I guess I should have done a little more research before I fully switched. :P
2008-06-14T10:30:00.000Z	kbreit	matthew_	You don't know how to run commands as root?
2008-06-14T10:30:00.000Z	matthew_	kbreit	i guess not, or maybe I do and I just didn't know that what it was called...i'm betting I just didn't know though
2008-06-14T10:31:00.000Z	kbreit	matthew_	su updatedb
2008-06-14T10:32:00.000Z	matthew_	kbreit	I continue to feel inept..."Unknown id: su updatedb"
2008-06-14T10:32:00.000Z	kbreit	matthew_	sudo updatedb rather
2008-06-14T10:35:00.000Z	matthew_	kbreit	I guess I didn't fully install it because it seems to be located at /home/matthew/.emusic  but it's not present when I navigate there...okay thanks.
