2011-09-27T22:50:00.000Z	iceroot	pythonsnake	you want a good gui or a good firewall?
2011-09-27T22:51:00.000Z	iceroot	pythonsnake	have a look at ufw or at "apt-cache search ufw" if there are good guis for it. to have the real power of a firewall, iptables is your only and very best friend
2011-09-27T22:53:00.000Z	pythonsnake	iceroot	both ?
2011-09-27T22:54:00.000Z	iceroot	pythonsnake	you dont need a gui for a firewall
2011-09-27T22:54:00.000Z	iceroot	pythonsnake	and normally you dont need a firewall
2011-09-27T22:54:00.000Z	iceroot	pythonsnake	most people think a firewall is a personal firewall like this strange windows-programs from norton and so on
2011-09-27T22:54:00.000Z	pythonsnake	iceroot	maximum security
2011-09-27T22:55:00.000Z	pythonsnake	iceroot	I want to control connections
2011-09-27T22:55:00.000Z	iceroot	pythonsnake	maximum security = cutting all cables
2011-09-27T22:55:00.000Z	iceroot	pythonsnake	or turn of the pc
2011-09-27T22:55:00.000Z	pythonsnake	iceroot	exagerrated
2011-09-27T22:55:00.000Z	pythonsnake	iceroot	iftables?
2011-09-27T22:56:00.000Z	iceroot	pythonsnake	iptables is THE firewall in the linux-world
2011-09-27T22:56:00.000Z	iceroot	pythonsnake	nothing has more power then iptables (and its like hell/perl-coding)
2011-09-27T22:57:00.000Z	pythonsnake	iceroot	:-)
2011-09-27T22:57:00.000Z	pythonsnake	iceroot	you know any good iptables front end ?
2011-09-27T22:58:00.000Z	iceroot	pythonsnake	use the shell
