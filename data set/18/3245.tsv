2009-11-08T19:10:00.000Z	faceman		yeah, iso was 705MB wouldn't go onto a 700MB CD
2009-11-08T19:10:00.000Z	faceman		so I'm going to try USB booting again
2009-11-08T19:10:00.000Z	faceman		does anyone have experiance making a bootable USB drive in OSX 10.4?
2009-11-08T19:12:00.000Z	faceman		do I have to name the bootable USB anything special?
2009-11-08T19:12:00.000Z	faceman		last time I tried this, I held down option at start up
2009-11-08T19:13:00.000Z	faceman		and it just didn't show up
2009-11-08T19:13:00.000Z	faceman		in the boot menu
2009-11-08T19:13:00.000Z	faceman		what kind of format should I make the USB drive?
2009-11-08T19:13:00.000Z	faceman		MS-DOS file system, or unix?
2009-11-08T19:13:00.000Z	faceman		or other?
2009-11-08T19:14:00.000Z	malnilion_	faceman	usually you want fat32 for USB sticks. Is it a hard drive?
2009-11-08T19:15:00.000Z	malnilion_	faceman	then vfat/fat32 would probably be best.
2009-11-08T19:17:00.000Z	malnilion_	faceman	I usually use gparted, but almost any disk manager or partition editor should support fat.
2009-11-08T19:22:00.000Z	malnilion_	faceman	why is your thumbdrive unformatted?
2009-11-08T19:23:00.000Z	malnilion_	faceman	why are you trying to put an iso on a thumb drive?
2009-11-08T19:28:00.000Z	malnilion_	faceman	I'm having trouble finding a guide for setting up a usb bootable installer from an iso on a mac.
2009-11-08T19:30:00.000Z	malnilion_	faceman	I have found a guide that would let you set up a bootable usb from a .img file like the Ubuntu Netbook Remix .img file: http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/how-to-create-an-ubuntu-installation-usb-on-the-mac/
2009-11-08T19:34:00.000Z	malnilion_	faceman	no the .img file for the usb is different than a .iso
