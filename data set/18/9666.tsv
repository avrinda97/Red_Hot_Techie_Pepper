2007-03-09T09:43:00.000Z	taTe		Can anybody help me installing Zsnes 1.51 from Terminal? Thanks
2007-03-09T09:44:00.000Z	Stormx2	taTe	Find the it's website, download, and read the "INSTALL" or "README" file
2007-03-09T09:44:00.000Z	Stormx2	taTe	Before you try to do any compiling though, run this "sudo apt-get install build-essential"
2007-03-09T09:45:00.000Z	Stormx2	taTe	Any errors?
2007-03-09T09:47:00.000Z	Stormx2	taTe	Try just "make" ?
2007-03-09T09:48:00.000Z	Stormx2	taTe	You using the SVN version or something?
2007-03-09T09:48:00.000Z	Stormx2	taTe	Usually with actual releases don't need to run autogen.sh
2007-03-09T09:49:00.000Z	Stormx2	taTe	You need to install the sdl dev package
2007-03-09T09:51:00.000Z	Stormx2	taTe	sudo apt-get install libsdl1.2-dev
2007-03-09T09:51:00.000Z	Stormx2	taTe	The general rule with compiling is when it says it needs a package (and the app is c/c++) it means you need the -dev package, which 90% of the time can be found in the repos
2007-03-09T09:52:00.000Z	taTe	Stormx2	All these packages begins with "lib*" ?
2007-03-09T09:52:00.000Z	Stormx2	taTe	Not necessarily.
2007-03-09T09:53:00.000Z	Stormx2	taTe	apt-cache search <name>
2007-03-09T09:54:00.000Z	Stormx2	taTe	I tend to add "| grep <name>" to the end too...
2007-03-09T09:55:00.000Z	taTe	Stormx2	nice, thanks
2007-03-09T09:58:00.000Z	taTe	Stormx2	I have installed the package and the error comes again... ?
2007-03-09T09:59:00.000Z	Stormx2	taTe	What is this that you are compiling again?
2007-03-09T10:00:00.000Z	taTe	Stormx2	Zsnes... a snes rom emulator
