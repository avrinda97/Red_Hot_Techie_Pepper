2009-11-22T02:57:00.000Z	Drakkoss		Are you still trying to recover your NTFS partition?
2009-11-22T02:58:00.000Z	d4non	Drakkoss	yep I am
2009-11-22T02:58:00.000Z	d4non	Drakkoss	did not succeed with gpart nor testdisk
2009-11-22T02:59:00.000Z	Drakkoss		you may have to do a search on Google.  My thinking is that I can
2009-11-22T02:59:00.000Z	Drakkoss		can't be done using software that you and I can get hold of
2009-11-22T03:00:00.000Z	Drakkoss		I hate lap tops ... any way to disable the touchpad?
2009-11-22T03:01:00.000Z	d4non		I screwed up a ntfs partition in ubuntu installating program, I picked the ntfs partition with most free space on it and I thought it's gonna make a new partition in the free space, but it removed the partition and formatted the amount of free space into ext3 and the rest became regular unalocated space, any hope to recover the data? Did not Write anything in there yet!
2009-11-22T03:08:00.000Z	Drakkoss		gosh ... I haven

2009-11-22T03:11:00.000Z	Drakkoss	d4non	are you booting off the drive that was overwritten?
2009-11-22T03:11:00.000Z	d4non	Drakkoss	I am on LiveCD
2009-11-22T03:14:00.000Z	Drakkoss	d4non	I don't think there is an easy way to backoff a repartition of that drive.  My understanding is that it may be possible to have a professional recovery service get the date off that drive.  I have not seen programs that will recover the data.  you may have to do a google search.  Don't use the drive, of course.
2009-11-22T03:14:00.000Z	Drakkoss		get the data ... lol
2009-11-22T03:16:00.000Z	Drakkoss		What is on that drive that you want to recover?
2009-11-22T03:17:00.000Z	d4non	Drakkoss	not using the drive is pretty obvious
2009-11-22T03:19:00.000Z	Drakkoss		@ d4non - yeah, I would think so, too ... but you never know.
2009-11-22T03:20:00.000Z	d4non	Drakkoss	already tried parted, gpart, and testdisk with no success :(
