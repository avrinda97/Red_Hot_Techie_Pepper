2012-03-04T13:40:00.000Z	DeltaSaucer		Um...
2012-03-04T13:41:00.000Z	DeltaSaucer		Why is the "restart" feature not in the menu, but hidden inside the dialogue box for when you choose "shut down"?
2012-03-04T13:41:00.000Z	DeltaSaucer		That's a worse design decision than... than... Windows 8 Metro.
2012-03-04T13:41:00.000Z	DeltaSaucer		You have to know that it's hidden inside the "shut down" menu item.
2012-03-04T13:42:00.000Z	DeltaSaucer		...
2012-03-04T13:42:00.000Z	DeltaSaucer		The MENU.
2012-03-04T13:42:00.000Z	DeltaSaucer		No idea what that is.
2012-03-04T13:42:00.000Z	DeltaSaucer		I'm talking about Ubuntu.
2012-03-04T13:42:00.000Z	DeltaSaucer		As it comes when you install it.
2012-03-04T13:43:00.000Z	DeltaSaucer		Anyone wish to comment on this?
2012-03-04T13:43:00.000Z	theadmin	DeltaSaucer	It's a sane decision in my opinion, but again, this channel is not for complaining, it's for support issues
2012-03-04T13:46:00.000Z	theadmin	DeltaSaucer	Hey, it's better than what GNOME did (they have no shut down option in the menu AT ALL, you have to log out first, and then choose "Shut down" at the login screen)
2012-03-04T13:48:00.000Z	DeltaSaucer	theadmin	:|
2012-03-04T13:48:00.000Z	theadmin	DeltaSaucer	What's wrong with it anyway? If you want to reboot fast, just create a desktop shortcut or whatever.
2012-03-04T13:51:00.000Z	theadmin	DeltaSaucer	Hey, nobody except you complains. And you know what? It's better this way. Screen space is damn important -_-
2012-03-04T13:53:00.000Z	theadmin	DeltaSaucer	Nobody really knows what makes the Ubuntu team take this or that decision -- there aren't many developers around here and the main big guy, Shuttleworth... I don't know if he visits, but it's highly unlikely. It was him who took the "hey let's hide most of the tray icons" decision too
2012-03-04T13:54:00.000Z	theadmin	DeltaSaucer	If you want, you can switch to Kubuntu, Xubuntu or Lubuntu which to most people make more sense than the standard Ubuntu setup
2012-03-04T13:55:00.000Z	theadmin	DeltaSaucer	To install a package, you: 1) verify the package checksum, 2) check for file conflicts, 3) check if deps are installed, 4) run pre-install script, 5) unpack archives, 6) run post-install scripts, 7) delete temporary files
