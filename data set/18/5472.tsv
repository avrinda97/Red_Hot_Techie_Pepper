2008-11-22T14:14:00.000Z	root______		oh and i write shell scripts   i have added almost 12k commands to my system.
2008-11-22T14:14:00.000Z	TiMiDo	root______	very nice.
2008-11-22T14:16:00.000Z	TiMiDo	root______	have you notice that irc with the root account is danger because you can actually exploit you're system?
2008-11-22T14:16:00.000Z	root______	TiMiDo	crack it if you can.   you wont get far here :)))
2008-11-22T14:16:00.000Z	TiMiDo	root______	well. who told you that?
2008-11-22T14:17:00.000Z	root______	TiMiDo	if it weren't for the effort of typing passwd root   to set a password i would offer to let you ssh in as root
2008-11-22T14:18:00.000Z	TiMiDo	root______	lol.
2008-11-22T14:18:00.000Z	TiMiDo	root______	iptables?
2008-11-22T14:21:00.000Z	root______	TiMiDo	of course iptables   but that's not why i'm not concerned about my account,   i'm not concerned about "root" because i made that account specally to irc with,  it's the most restricted account on the whole system.
2008-11-22T14:21:00.000Z	TiMiDo	root______	very nice.
2008-11-22T14:29:00.000Z	root______	TiMiDo	a few other odd things one would find when accessing this "root" account  are that i don't have partitions, don't use swap, and that the whole system is "nosuid".    just an fyi.
2008-11-22T14:29:00.000Z	TiMiDo	root______	can you tell me what thi's guy script does?
2008-11-22T14:30:00.000Z	root______	TiMiDo	let me see it ?
2008-11-22T14:34:00.000Z	root______	TiMiDo	yes i can give you a general overview of what that script does.    it basicly installs a lot of extra packages and some non-packaged stuff that it has to compile on-site,   it also deletes most of the build dirs so one can not clenly remove what was just built and installed.
2008-11-22T14:39:00.000Z	TiMiDo	root______	that's a lame script lol
2008-11-22T14:39:00.000Z	root______	TiMiDo	no it's a shell script
2008-11-22T14:40:00.000Z	root______	TiMiDo	oh you mean lame   hehhe yes
2008-11-22T14:41:00.000Z	root______	TiMiDo	basicly i wouldn't run anything like that until i had gone over every command in it and checked out all the non-packaged stuff
