2005-04-14T14:25:00.000Z	EvilIdler		When I do the first apt-get upgrade after a fresh install of Hoary, GLX stops working. Any ideas what breaks it?
2005-04-14T14:25:00.000Z	bob2`	EvilIdler	did it upgrade your kernel?
2005-04-14T14:25:00.000Z	EvilIdler	bob2`	Nope. I'm still on the first reboot after initial install with the CD
2005-04-14T14:26:00.000Z	bob2`	EvilIdler	did you redo the steps on wiki.ubuntu.com/BinaryDriverHowto
2005-04-14T14:26:00.000Z	EvilIdler	bob2`	Done those many times :/
2005-04-14T14:27:00.000Z	EvilIdler	bob2`	xpdyinfo claims I have GLX, and removing the packages and using NVidia's installer makes no change. I get 2D, no 3D
2005-04-14T14:28:00.000Z	bob2`	EvilIdler	"no 3d"? how so? black empty windows when you run glxgears?
2005-04-14T14:29:00.000Z	EvilIdler	bob2`	Whenever I run ANY GL program, including my own, I get this error: OpenGL GLX extension not supported by display ':0.0
2005-04-14T14:29:00.000Z	EvilIdler	bob2`	xpdyinfo lists NV-GLX as installed and OK
2005-04-14T14:29:00.000Z	bob2`	EvilIdler	ok, don't know then, sorry.  I'd try asking on the list.
2005-04-14T14:29:00.000Z	EvilIdler	bob2`	It looks like my only option to get 3D working is to not upgrade Hoary :/
2005-04-14T14:31:00.000Z	bob2`	EvilIdler	no, you ask on the list and report a bug
2005-04-14T14:31:00.000Z	EvilIdler	bob2`	There's a bugzilla or something, right?
2005-04-14T14:32:00.000Z	bob2`	EvilIdler	bugzilla.ubuntu.com
2005-04-14T14:32:00.000Z	EvilIdler	bob2`	Cheers
2005-04-14T14:34:00.000Z	EvilIdler	bob2`	Seems my bugs have already been reported multiple times. Time for some fun reading :)
2005-04-14T14:51:00.000Z	bob2`	EvilIdler	that's an nvidia proprietary driver issue, aiui
2005-04-14T14:52:00.000Z	EvilIdler	bob2`	Perhaps. At least I have 3D accelleration now, and can go back to coding
