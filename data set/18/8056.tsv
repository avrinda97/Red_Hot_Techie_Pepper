2008-09-18T06:51:00.000Z	phantomcircuit	iFvwm	imap supports server side searching, it was essentially intended for mobile email where the client doesnt have the ability to search all of the emails locally
2008-09-18T06:53:00.000Z	iFvwm	phantomcircuit	yes, but my gmail has thousands mail. to trouble for me. i do not need those mail appeared in my inbox.

2008-09-18T06:53:00.000Z	phantomcircuit	iFvwm	and not using imap helps you how there?

2008-09-18T06:56:00.000Z	iFvwm	phantomcircuit	i just use a POP.
2008-09-18T06:56:00.000Z	phantomcircuit	iFvwm	but POP downloads all your messages also...
2008-09-18T06:57:00.000Z	iFvwm	phantomcircuit	yes,first time only.
2008-09-18T06:57:00.000Z	iFvwm	phantomcircuit	then every day now, few mails now. so clear.
2008-09-18T06:58:00.000Z	phantomcircuit	iFvwm	um you do realize right that imap doesnt download all your emails everytime it runs right? it just checks their status as a unique id
2008-09-18T06:59:00.000Z	iFvwm	phantomcircuit	i know this. and imap' search is good. but i do not need those function(advanced ).
