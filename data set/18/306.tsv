2012-04-28T07:21:00.000Z	jjmilne1		This release is pretty good, I'm just not sure if I fixed the login bug I was having or not. I guess I'll find out later
2012-04-28T07:22:00.000Z	jjmilne1		I ca n't consistantly recreate it
2012-04-28T07:22:00.000Z	jjmilne1		Apparently doing unity --reset fixes it so we'll see.
2012-04-28T07:22:00.000Z	jjmilne1		No, it's like when you try to log in the screen is black and all you see is the mouse
2012-04-28T07:23:00.000Z	jjmilne1		I looked it up and doing unity --reset apparently fixes it so we'll see.
2012-04-28T07:24:00.000Z	jjmilne1		If that doesn't work then I'll try something else.
2012-04-28T07:25:00.000Z	jjmilne1		That's odd.

2012-04-28T07:25:00.000Z	robinsch	jjmilne1	my problem is that ubuntu just crashes out of nowhere and logs out
2012-04-28T07:22:00.000Z	robinsch	jjmilne1	?
2012-04-28T07:24:00.000Z	robinsch	jjmilne1	unity --reset didn't work for me
2012-04-28T07:25:00.000Z	robinsch	jjmilne1	i didn't install anything
2012-04-28T07:25:00.000Z	robinsch	jjmilne1	clean install

2012-04-28T07:26:00.000Z	robinsch	jjmilne1	 i am trying to look for help online apperently i am the onlyone with this issue
2012-04-28T07:28:00.000Z	robinsch	jjmilne1	maybe my hardware is faulty but i have upgraded ubuntu without issues from 8.04 to 11.04 without issues, i decided to do clean install this time
2012-04-28T07:44:00.000Z	jjmilne1	robinsch	if you're ready to try anything at this point I'd try the 32 bit version. It could work
