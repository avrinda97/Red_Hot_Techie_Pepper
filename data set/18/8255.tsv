2007-09-16T07:06:00.000Z	koudelka_	isai	you don't have any sound at all?
2007-09-16T07:10:00.000Z	koudelka_	isai	what are you writing when you are starting .exe files with wine?
2007-09-16T07:12:00.000Z	koudelka_	isai	and nothing happens? or what does it say?
2007-09-16T07:13:00.000Z	koudelka_	isai	have you been in "winecfg"?
2007-09-16T07:15:00.000Z	koudelka_	isai	it's the wine config type winecfg in the terminal and check your settings. you probably want windows xp as your windows version if it isn't set as that
2007-09-16T07:18:00.000Z	koudelka_	isai	you just select the windows version you want on that list in the "Applications" tab
