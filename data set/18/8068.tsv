2007-10-05T07:10:00.000Z	d4t2ill4		thank you erUSUL
2007-10-05T07:11:00.000Z	d4t2ill4		I am downloading the dev tools now
2007-10-05T07:12:00.000Z	d4t2ill4		This new version of Ubuntu is so easy to use.
2007-10-05T07:12:00.000Z	d4t2ill4		7.0.4
2007-10-05T07:13:00.000Z	danar	d4t2ill4	wait until gutsy :)
2007-10-05T07:13:00.000Z	danar	d4t2ill4	oct 18th
2007-10-05T07:13:00.000Z	d4t2ill4	danar	is that a good expression ?
2007-10-05T07:14:00.000Z	danar	d4t2ill4	?
2007-10-05T07:15:00.000Z	d4t2ill4	danar	so it would be much simpler to use with Gutsy version ?
2007-10-05T07:15:00.000Z	danar	d4t2ill4	maybe not much simpler, but it's an improvement. and there are things like a GUI for configuring X and such, so some things are 'simpler', yes
2007-10-05T07:16:00.000Z	danar	d4t2ill4	which means a non command-line application for configuring graphics options and such
2007-10-05T07:16:00.000Z	danar	d4t2ill4	i think gutsy will be more efficient
2007-10-05T07:16:00.000Z	d4t2ill4	danar	that's good!
2007-10-05T07:17:00.000Z	danar	d4t2ill4	it's due on the 18th
2007-10-05T07:17:00.000Z	d4t2ill4	danar	I remember trying to get wireless working I had to install a few connection manager program just to avoid cli
2007-10-05T07:18:00.000Z	danar	d4t2ill4	i don't use wireless, so i can't speak to that, but lots of things will be improved
2007-10-05T07:20:00.000Z	danar	d4t2ill4	codecs.... legal/patent issues
2007-10-05T07:21:00.000Z	d4t2ill4	danar	I see
