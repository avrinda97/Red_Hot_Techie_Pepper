2007-09-29T13:00:00.000Z	MasterShrek	_imran_	why? its not going to do you any good
2007-09-29T13:01:00.000Z	MasterShrek	_imran_	im assuming you want to make an archive of the folder, like a rar, tar, zip, bzip, gunzip or something

2007-09-29T14:05:00.000Z	MasterShrek	_imran_	do u know what dpkg is for?
2007-09-29T14:06:00.000Z	MasterShrek	_imran_	not really, it can, but its used for installing deb packages, and reconfiguring them and such
2007-09-29T14:07:00.000Z	MasterShrek	_imran_	what are you trying to accomplish? are you trying to make a deb package?
2007-09-29T14:10:00.000Z	_imran_	MasterShrek	that doesnt work: it says: dpkg: error processing *.deb (--install):
2007-09-29T14:10:00.000Z	MasterShrek	_imran_	are you in the folder with all the deb files?
2007-09-29T14:10:00.000Z	_imran_	MasterShrek	do i need to put a directory in?
2007-09-29T14:11:00.000Z	MasterShrek	_imran_	maybe
2007-09-29T14:11:00.000Z	MasterShrek	_imran_	have you looked at the man page?
2007-09-29T14:11:00.000Z	MasterShrek	_imran_	try: sudo dpkg -i /path/to/*.deb
2007-09-29T14:12:00.000Z	MasterShrek	_imran_	type: man dpkg
2007-09-29T14:13:00.000Z	_imran_	MasterShrek	i typed:  sudo dpkg -i /media/Imran's Hardddrive/Ubuntu Games/*.deb
2007-09-29T14:14:00.000Z	_imran_	MasterShrek	and it just says >
2007-09-29T14:15:00.000Z	MasterShrek	_imran_	why do you have so many debian packages to install? cant you use apt for them?
