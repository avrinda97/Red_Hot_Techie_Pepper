2006-03-26T13:34:00.000Z	Koobi		Raul1654: apt-cache search emacs shows that the package emacs21 is avaialable
2006-03-26T13:36:00.000Z	Koobi		do any of you use bitchx?
2006-03-26T13:36:00.000Z	Koobi		is irssi good?
2006-03-26T13:36:00.000Z	Koobi		i cant copy/paste to/from bitchx
2006-03-26T13:37:00.000Z	Koobi		i'll try that now then...thought about switching to xchat but i'll give irssi a try
2006-03-26T13:37:00.000Z	Koobi		Raul1654, try emacs21
2006-03-26T13:37:00.000Z	graft	Koobi	chatzilla is decent too...
2006-03-26T13:38:00.000Z	Koobi	graft	that would mean i would have to have mozilla open, right?
2006-03-26T13:38:00.000Z	graft	Koobi	yeah...
2006-03-26T13:45:00.000Z	Koobi	graft	my repo's seem to show development versions of irssi. but theres a irssi-text version avaialable which i would prefer but does it allow copy/pasting?
2006-03-26T13:46:00.000Z	graft	Koobi	um... what're you running? 5.10?
2006-03-26T13:47:00.000Z	Koobi	graft	irssi-text is fine?
2006-03-26T13:48:00.000Z	Koobi	graft	ok, i'll install the dev version then
2006-03-26T14:21:00.000Z	graft	Koobi	paste still not working?
2006-03-26T14:22:00.000Z	graft	Koobi	nah, no need to read any manual... it's ridiculously easy
2006-03-26T14:23:00.000Z	graft	Koobi	the only thing you need to know is ALT-1, ALT-2 to switch windows, etc.
2006-03-26T14:24:00.000Z	Koobi	graft	/connect irc.freenode.net seems to time out eventually
2006-03-26T14:25:00.000Z	graft	Koobi	/server irc.freenode.net
