2006-12-08T11:56:00.000Z	dyz	HuibertGill	The instructions im following say to uninstall what that one says to install
2006-12-08T11:57:00.000Z	dyz		Now im confused
2006-12-08T11:58:00.000Z	dyz		How can I edit xorg.conf?
2006-12-08T11:58:00.000Z	HuibertGill	dyz	yes, it's for the opensource ati driver.
2006-12-08T11:58:00.000Z	HuibertGill	dyz	you have to decide if you want the one or the other
2006-12-08T11:58:00.000Z	dyz	HuibertGill	Im going for the one that works with beryl.
2006-12-08T11:59:00.000Z	HuibertGill	dyz	afaik then you need the closed source one, but I'm not sure
2006-12-08T12:03:00.000Z	dyz		Oh this doesnt look good
2006-12-08T12:03:00.000Z	dyz		I installed the driver it says I need for beryl, and the boot up screen looks wierd.
2006-12-08T12:03:00.000Z	HuibertGill	dyz	what happened?
2006-12-08T12:04:00.000Z	HuibertGill	dyz	wieird as in?
2006-12-08T12:05:00.000Z	dyz	HuibertGill	Half of it was missing
2006-12-08T12:05:00.000Z	dyz	HuibertGill	Luckily its just the boot up screen, the desktop appears to look fine
2006-12-08T12:06:00.000Z	HuibertGill	dyz	so, beryl working? with the opensource drivers?
2006-12-08T12:07:00.000Z	dyz	HuibertGill	Dont know, was installing the drivers first. Working on beryl right now.
2006-12-08T12:08:00.000Z	HuibertGill	dyz	ok, please write if it worked or not, I'm curious.
2006-12-08T12:08:00.000Z	dyz	HuibertGill	I will, itll just be a few minutes
