2006-08-20T14:31:00.000Z	Aagni	bobovski	try this: service dhcpd restart
2006-08-20T14:32:00.000Z	bobovski	Aagni	ok, thanks
2006-08-20T14:33:00.000Z	bobovski	Aagni	service command not found
2006-08-20T14:35:00.000Z	Aagni	bobovski	try restarting that particular interface
2006-08-20T14:36:00.000Z	Aagni	bobovski	e.g. ifdown eth0; ifup eth0 (assuming its eth0 )
2006-08-20T14:36:00.000Z	bobovski	Aagni	I acutally got /etc/init.d/network restart to work...
2006-08-20T14:36:00.000Z	Aagni	bobovski	yay ;)
2006-08-20T14:38:00.000Z	Aagni	bobovski	what are you trying to do?
2006-08-20T14:39:00.000Z	bobovski	Aagni	well, resolving dns was taking a long time when my router was getting the dns from my ISP. So, I changed my resolv.conf (with advice from sethk) to use a static dns, not provided by my isp
2006-08-20T14:39:00.000Z	bobovski	Aagni	but it seemed to work better when my 'puter got the dns from the router which was set up for static dns
2006-08-20T14:40:00.000Z	bobovski	Aagni	So, I think I'll settle for that configuration
2006-08-20T14:40:00.000Z	Aagni	bobovski	i see
2006-08-20T14:41:00.000Z	bobovski	Aagni	except now I can't get resolv.conf to set nameserver to my router
2006-08-20T14:41:00.000Z	bobovski	Aagni	make the file read-only?
2006-08-20T14:42:00.000Z	Aagni	bobovski	what do u mean you cant get ?
2006-08-20T14:43:00.000Z	bobovski	Aagni	My resolv.conf looks like: nameserver 192.168.1.1 and then two more below it. When I restart the network, it gets rid of the first line
2006-08-20T14:44:00.000Z	Aagni	bobovski	no idea to be honest
2006-08-20T14:44:00.000Z	bobovski	Aagni	me neither :)
