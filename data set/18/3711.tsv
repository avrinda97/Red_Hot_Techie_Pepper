2009-08-19T06:47:00.000Z	drcheezenstein		Anyone know why I am getting an error when I try to update my laptop?
2009-08-19T06:48:00.000Z	majuk	drcheezenstein	Not smiling enough.
2009-08-19T06:54:00.000Z	majuk	drcheezenstein	Are you sure your BIOS is booting to the correct hard drive when you try to boot to Ubuntu?
2009-08-19T07:04:00.000Z	majuk	drcheezenstein	Dude, if the hard drive boots when you select it in the LiveCD and NOT when you boot normally, it's GOT to be a BIOS problem.
2009-08-19T07:05:00.000Z	majuk	drcheezenstein	Blah, no, that's wrong, could still be a bad GRUB install.
2009-08-19T07:05:00.000Z	drcheezenstein	majuk	I agree with you its a bios problem
2009-08-19T07:05:00.000Z	majuk	drcheezenstein	But my BEST GUESS is BIOS
2009-08-19T07:05:00.000Z	drcheezenstein	majuk	well this installation cd has worked on all my other computers
2009-08-19T07:06:00.000Z	majuk	drcheezenstein	Then it's probably BIOS. Get in there and find the boot order
2009-08-19T07:06:00.000Z	drcheezenstein	majuk	there was no non usb hardrive optin in the boot order unfortuantely
2009-08-19T07:06:00.000Z	majuk	drcheezenstein	Yea, you say that, but I don't believe you.
2009-08-19T07:10:00.000Z	majuk	drcheezenstein	a94060: I agree, although I'm still not convinced the BIOS isn't to blame.
2009-08-19T07:11:00.000Z	majuk	drcheezenstein	a94060: so reinstall grub?
2009-08-19T08:37:00.000Z	majuk	drcheezenstein	TOLD YOU SO!
2009-08-19T08:38:00.000Z	drcheezenstein	majuk	:-p
2009-08-19T08:40:00.000Z	majuk	drcheezenstein	You probably need to get the new firmware from the Broadcom website.
2009-08-19T09:06:00.000Z	drcheezenstein	majuk	you have any expierinace getting broadcom wireless cards working on laptops ubuntu 8.04?
