2009-12-27T17:51:00.000Z	daughain		OK, whats the command to edit the smb.conf?
2009-12-27T17:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	daughain	 its a text file  'sudo texteditoryoulike /path/to/file'
2009-12-27T17:52:00.000Z	daughain	Dr_Willis	That doesnt help me much, as I am comparatively new to linux, and have no lcue what the paths are. Or what text editors are on this machine.
2009-12-27T17:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	daughain	 time to learn some linux basics..  I guess..  /etc/samba/ is teh path .  then  pick any text editor you like. nano, vi, geany, gedit. and so on.
2009-12-27T17:54:00.000Z	daughain	Dr_Willis	 Thats what I am working on. =) Just need to get a stable install, it seems.
2009-12-27T17:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	daughain	 about every release ive tried of ubuntu was stable by my standards.
2009-12-27T17:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	daughain	 of course once ya learn the basics/core of linux - most all disrtos are about the same. :)
2009-12-27T17:55:00.000Z	daughain	Dr_Willis	Its partialy a hardware issue as well in this case.
2009-12-27T17:55:00.000Z	daughain	Dr_Willis	 Sounds like all OS'. =)
2009-12-27T17:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	daughain	 nah.. windows likes to change things for weird reasons.. vi is still vi on linux. :)
2009-12-27T17:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		been using vi as an editor now for 10+ years.. :)
2009-12-27T17:56:00.000Z	daughain	Dr_Willis	 Well, give me more thsn 1 month on linux. =)
2009-12-27T17:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	daughain	 1 month and you dont know what text editors are there? :)  You been playing with the CUBE too muich. :)
2009-12-27T17:57:00.000Z	daughain	Dr_Willis	 At east I know what edits I need to make.
2009-12-27T17:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	daughain	 thats sort of like running befor you can walk. :)   'crawl, walk, run... then in linux  'Fly!'"
2009-12-27T17:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	daughain	 you did install the full samba package right - the smb.conf exists  by default. but samba service is not installed by default
2009-12-27T17:58:00.000Z	daughain		Ya, samba as been installed, just need to change my workgroup name, and swet it to look for windows server.
2009-12-27T18:01:00.000Z	daughain	Dr_Willis	 Sometimes you need to run before you walk. =)
