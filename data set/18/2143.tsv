2011-06-09T02:09:00.000Z	rationalOgre	hidnshadows	does it do this in other operating systems?
2011-06-09T02:10:00.000Z	rationalOgre	hidnshadows	You are going to need to create an account. /msg NickServ help
2011-06-09T02:11:00.000Z	rationalOgre	hidnshadows	then you will need to set up SASL on your IRC client to identify you.
2011-06-09T02:13:00.000Z	rationalOgre	hidnshadows	in a terminal run "sudo lshw -C video | grep product"
2011-06-09T02:15:00.000Z	rationalOgre	hidnshadows	does the same thing happen in other operating systems? (Windows, etc?)
2011-06-09T02:21:00.000Z	rationalOgre	hidnshadows	Without testing other operating systems there's really no way to tell. You could make a boot cd of SUSE or some other linux livecd and try that
2011-06-09T02:22:00.000Z	hidnshadows	rationalOgre	it's even on the BIOS...
2011-06-09T02:25:00.000Z	rationalOgre	hidnshadows	then it's def hardware
2011-06-09T02:25:00.000Z	rationalOgre	hidnshadows	either video chip or monitor
2011-06-09T02:25:00.000Z	rationalOgre	hidnshadows	my bet would be video chip
2011-06-09T02:26:00.000Z	rationalOgre	hidnshadows	you could test it for sure by plugging in an external monitor if your laptop is capable of that.
2011-06-09T02:26:00.000Z	rationalOgre	hidnshadows	if it does it on the external monitor, then it's graphics card, if it doesn't, its monitor.
2011-06-09T02:27:00.000Z	hidnshadows	rationalOgre	it's the graphics card, just checked it... ;__; And this unit's 10 years old, good luck for warranty
2011-06-09T02:27:00.000Z	rationalOgre	hidnshadows	Yeah, no warranty there. Sorry man. New mobo or new laptop.
2011-06-09T02:27:00.000Z	rationalOgre	hidnshadows	I suggest new laptop.
2011-06-09T02:27:00.000Z	rationalOgre	hidnshadows	10 years is a good long life for a laptop
2011-06-09T02:28:00.000Z	hidnshadows	rationalOgre	and the WiFi antenna is AMAZING... they just don't make em like they used to
2011-06-09T02:33:00.000Z	rationalOgre	hidnshadows	sorry it died on you, sir. Not much to do other than tons of research for a new laptop. :D
