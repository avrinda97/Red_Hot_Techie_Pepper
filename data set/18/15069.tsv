2005-05-18T09:54:00.000Z	metalsand		Well, I'm sure someone with this card and this kernel does... But yeah. :P
2005-05-18T09:54:00.000Z	metalsand		The quick checking in... Lol
2005-05-18T09:55:00.000Z	metalsand		I guess it's a good habbit, I'm just so used to sitting on my computer for 5 hours at a time :P
2005-05-18T09:56:00.000Z	metalsand		Holy crap
2005-05-18T09:56:00.000Z	metalsand		What's evolution-alamr-notify

2005-05-18T09:57:00.000Z	metalsand		I thought Linux would be a lot less stressful
2005-05-18T09:57:00.000Z	metalsand		I didn't expect 120 megs

2005-05-18T10:03:00.000Z	revelater	metalsand	don't worry about it, when the system needs more memory it will clear some out
