2007-09-06T13:46:00.000Z	Creed		Anyone know what VPN software Hamachi/LogMeIn uses? Or how to do something similair (minus the lag that comes with openvpn).
2007-09-06T13:46:00.000Z	scguy318	Creed	Hamachi is proprietary stuff, freer stuff would be OpenVPN or SSH (not really VPN tho)
2007-09-06T13:47:00.000Z	Creed	scguy318	yeah :( Issue with OpenVPN is the latency when gaming. SSH cant really do what I want :(
2007-09-06T13:52:00.000Z	Creed	scguy318	sadly no :( Not even enabled on...bah done even remember what codename 7.10 has.
