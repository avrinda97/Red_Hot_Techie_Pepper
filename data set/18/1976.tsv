2011-10-25T20:39:00.000Z	luis_	Insayne	If you disconnect the the drive from your system can you boot up the old OS?
2011-10-25T20:40:00.000Z	luis_	Insayne	Yes
2011-10-25T20:42:00.000Z	luis_	Insayne	Don't use Wubi  I you use a Ubuntu CD to install it will see the new hard drive and you can choose that for a install.
2011-10-25T20:45:00.000Z	luis_	Insayne	During the install it will see both your HDD's choose your new drive for the install. Then you will have dual boot options
