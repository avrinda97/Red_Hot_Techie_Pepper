2010-01-12T20:27:00.000Z	crisb2010		does nobody have an idea what the problem with the proxy might be?
2010-01-12T20:28:00.000Z	LjL	crisb2010	does it work if you manually type export http_proxy=blah ?
2010-01-12T20:29:00.000Z	crisb2010	LjL	i just tried that, this doesn't work either
2010-01-12T20:29:00.000Z	LjL	crisb2010	what program are you trying it with?
2010-01-12T20:29:00.000Z	LjL	crisb2010	also, are you specifying the port, too?
2010-01-12T20:30:00.000Z	crisb2010	LjL	i am in the terminal
2010-01-12T20:30:00.000Z	crisb2010	LjL	and i tried to do a simple ping and an apt-get update
2010-01-12T20:30:00.000Z	LjL	crisb2010	"ping" ignores any proxy (since "ping" is not about http). as to apt-get, i think i recall you need to set a specific config option for it - moment
2010-01-12T20:31:00.000Z	crisb2010	LjL	i guess that the software center doesn't work has to do with that too, right?
2010-01-12T20:31:00.000Z	LjL	crisb2010	yeah, software center just uses apt
2010-01-12T20:33:00.000Z	LjL	crisb2010	try adding the line « Acquire::http::Proxy "http://server:port" » to your /etc/apt/apt.conf
2010-01-12T20:33:00.000Z	crisb2010	LjL	let me try
2010-01-12T20:34:00.000Z	crisb2010	LjL	was already in there, perhaps because i set the proxy system wide
2010-01-12T20:34:00.000Z	LjL	crisb2010	are you positive the proxy server itself works, and doesn't need authentication?
2010-01-12T20:34:00.000Z	crisb2010	LjL	jep
2010-01-12T20:35:00.000Z	LjL	crisb2010	does it work with any program - like w3m or wget or something?
2010-01-12T20:37:00.000Z	crisb2010	LjL	now it works
2010-01-12T20:37:00.000Z	crisb2010	LjL	thanks for the help
