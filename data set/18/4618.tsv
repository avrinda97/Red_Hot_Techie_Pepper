2010-04-05T19:58:00.000Z	deightm		win7 -> win7 on the same network and same machines and even same files always gave me ~950 kbyte/s for las half year
2010-04-05T19:58:00.000Z	deightm		but win7 -> ubuntu looks like if its limiting connection someway
2010-04-05T19:59:00.000Z	deightm		yeah but why then people always say that ms sux, and linux rules
2010-04-05T19:59:00.000Z	deightm		if it cannot even give comparable speed?
2010-04-05T20:00:00.000Z	deightm		really how to increase wifi connection speed
2010-04-05T20:00:00.000Z	deightm		when it comes to 10gb file its huge difference between 950 and 500 kbytes/s
2010-04-05T20:00:00.000Z	deightm		what can i do to?
2010-04-05T20:01:00.000Z	deightm		will the thing called madwifi help me?
2010-04-05T20:01:00.000Z	deightm		cmon answer please
2010-04-05T20:01:00.000Z	deightm		anyone
2010-04-05T20:01:00.000Z	acicula	deightm	that question does not make sense
2010-04-05T20:02:00.000Z	acicula	deightm	madwifi are drivers for a certain type of card
2010-04-05T20:02:00.000Z	acicula	deightm	as someone said it can be any number of things
2010-04-05T20:03:00.000Z	acicula	deightm	poor wireless driver implementation(try a newer one), different tcp/ip defaults, different tx/rx settings by the driver or card even
2010-04-05T20:04:00.000Z	acicula	deightm	you cant swap out wireless drivers, each one is specific to your card
2010-04-05T20:04:00.000Z	acicula	deightm	all you can do is try a newer revision
2010-04-05T20:05:00.000Z	acicula	deightm	timeout values i suppose, how are you mounting a share?
2010-04-05T20:08:00.000Z	acicula	deightm	i think it uses gvsd daemons to mount the share, alternatively you can try a traditional approach using mount
