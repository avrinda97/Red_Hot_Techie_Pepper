2006-04-05T06:59:00.000Z	BockBilbo		hello there
2006-04-05T07:00:00.000Z	BockBilbo		is it possible to install gaim 2.0 beta 3 from the sources in dapper without having to remove the ubuntu-desktop metapackage?
2006-04-05T07:01:00.000Z	_jason	BockBilbo	ubuntu-desktop is just a meta-package, it is safe to remove.  You really only need it during a dist-upgrade to a new release
2006-04-05T07:01:00.000Z	BockBilbo	_jason	i know its safe to remove it
2006-04-05T07:02:00.000Z	_jason	BockBilbo	ah, I see your reasoning
2006-04-05T07:02:00.000Z	BockBilbo	_jason	see, to install the built version of gaim beta 3, i had uninstalled gaim from the repos
2006-04-05T07:03:00.000Z	_jason	BockBilbo	you can't keep both installed?  (just make sure the old version doesn't get run)
2006-04-05T07:03:00.000Z	_jason	BockBilbo	new gaim is going in /usr/local anyway so it's not messing with old gaim.  Only problem I would see is ~/.gaim being used differently
2006-04-05T07:03:00.000Z	BockBilbo	_jason	im afraid that there will be some problems with overwriting files...
2006-04-05T07:05:00.000Z	_jason	BockBilbo	BockBilbo dpkg  -L for gaim 2 beta 2 shows everything in /usr/local or /usr/share/doc/gaim-2.0.0beta2, so I don't think there will be a problem
2006-04-05T07:05:00.000Z	BockBilbo	_jason	im dealing with beta3, compiled by me
2006-04-05T07:06:00.000Z	_jason	BockBilbo	I am just mentioning that beta2 compiled by me would not conflict with any of the repo gaim files, you can check in the same way
2006-04-05T07:07:00.000Z	BockBilbo	_jason	ive checked it
2006-04-05T07:08:00.000Z	_jason	BockBilbo	np
2006-04-05T07:10:00.000Z	_jason	BockBilbo	nope, I tried for several hours to compile it in with beta1 and then found out it wasn't finished.  So I didn't even try for beta2
2006-04-05T07:10:00.000Z	BockBilbo	_jason	i guess it will work in future releases
2006-05-18T08:24:00.000Z	_jason	BockBilbo	there is a default one that should get created in /etc/skel/.bashrc
2006-05-18T08:31:00.000Z	BockBilbo	_jason	im going to copy the bash template at /etc/skel/.bashrc on my home directory, is that ok?
