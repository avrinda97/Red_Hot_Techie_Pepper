2008-05-05T02:58:00.000Z	snake_		hello. can anyone tell me how to change my localhost directory from /var/www to /home folder
2008-05-05T02:59:00.000Z	luser_	snake_	do you mean for apache?
2008-05-05T03:00:00.000Z	luser_	snake_	you might want to make a link from one directory to the other instead of changing the config
2008-05-05T03:01:00.000Z	snake_	luser_	tell me how to do that link ?
2008-05-05T03:02:00.000Z	snake_	luser_	tell me how to do that link ?
2008-05-05T03:03:00.000Z	luser_	snake_	use the "ln" command, hang on just a sec and ill see what exactly the command would be
2008-05-05T03:04:00.000Z	snake_	luser_	thanks. will it work if i put something to my home directory and type localhost ?
2008-05-05T03:05:00.000Z	luser_	snake_	well i would not put it directly to your home directory, make a /home/username/www directory first
2008-05-05T03:06:00.000Z	snake_	luser_	i have /home/snake now
2008-05-05T03:08:00.000Z	luser_	snake_	i think this will work - make /home/snake/www then go to /var and use: sudo ln -s /home/snake/www
2008-05-05T03:12:00.000Z	snake_	luser_	when i go to /var it says ln: creating symbolic link `./www': File exists
2008-05-05T03:16:00.000Z	luser_	snake_	do you know how to change the documentroot?
2008-05-05T03:23:00.000Z	snake_	luser_	nope i dont know how to change it
2008-05-05T03:25:00.000Z	luser_	snake_	check out http://www.faqs.org/docs/securing/chap29sec245.html
2008-05-05T03:28:00.000Z	luser_	snake_	to get the symlink to work, do "mkdir /home/snake/test" and then "sudo ln -s /home/luser/test /var/www/" and /home/test will be available at http://localhost/test
2008-05-05T03:29:00.000Z	luser_	snake_	err "sudo ln -s /home/snake/test /var/www/"
2008-05-05T03:30:00.000Z	snake_	luser_	thanks. got it
2008-05-05T03:30:00.000Z	luser_	snake_	:) :)
