2006-12-29T17:46:00.000Z	Tsukaggin		Okay, I just left the room about 30 mins ago, and I just came in to find 2 search for files windows open. One is empty, the other has results being a Restore folder, with a long number, mount point manager remote database, and tracking.log. My firewall detects no hits. Have I been breached?
2006-12-29T17:48:00.000Z	Tsukaggin		. .  any one? Hello?
2006-12-29T17:49:00.000Z	mnoir	Tsukaggin	not that likely - what do you have set to run in cron?
2006-12-29T17:51:00.000Z	mnoir	Tsukaggin	are the windows at command prompt?
2006-12-29T17:53:00.000Z	mnoir	Tsukaggin	hmm - strange...I do not have a clue and I cannot see them... :(
2006-12-29T17:54:00.000Z	mnoir	Tsukaggin	I am very curious to see the screencap
2006-12-29T17:57:00.000Z	mnoir	Tsukaggin	the bigger win looks like you were trying to open a file in some app and it was getting the particulars
2006-12-29T17:58:00.000Z	mnoir	Tsukaggin	possible - were you impatient at something?
2006-12-29T17:59:00.000Z	mnoir	Tsukaggin	oh and that guy on the wallpaper is ugly....
2006-12-29T06:00:00.000Z	mnoir	Tsukaggin	it looks like the back window is the parent - what is it?
2006-12-29T06:02:00.000Z	mnoir	Tsukaggin	frankly, i think you should blow away the bigger win and see what happens to the back one - it does not look dangerous - looks like a mouse slip....
2006-12-29T06:03:00.000Z	mnoir	Tsukaggin	yes??
2006-12-29T06:04:00.000Z	mnoir	Tsukaggin	garbage from some mouse slip i think
2006-12-29T06:07:00.000Z	mnoir	Tsukaggin	i do not know how tightly you manage ff and java/javascript, etc
2006-12-29T06:08:00.000Z	mnoir	Tsukaggin	i would recommend purging all cache, get the NOSCRIPT plugin, disable cookies, etc
2006-12-29T06:09:00.000Z	mnoir	Tsukaggin	the only susupect vectors into an ubuntu system right now are all the browser related things
2006-12-29T06:11:00.000Z	mnoir	Tsukaggin	i am not convinced though - still looks like a mouse slip to me :)
2006-12-29T06:12:00.000Z	mnoir	Tsukaggin	:)
