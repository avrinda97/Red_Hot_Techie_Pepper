2008-07-17T03:39:00.000Z	mneptok	owner	quick answer. maybe.
2008-07-17T03:40:00.000Z	mneptok	owner	ignore anyone saying "should." there is no way to make such an assessment accurately without knowing the card's chipset model and vendor.
2008-07-17T03:40:00.000Z	mneptok	owner	who makes the the chipset on the card?
2008-07-17T03:41:00.000Z	mneptok	owner	(hint, Linksys does nto make wireless chipsets)
2008-07-17T03:43:00.000Z	mneptok	owner	what exact model is the card?
2008-07-17T03:44:00.000Z	mneptok	owner	since it's Linksys and this is a laptop, is this a Cardbus or ExpressCard?
2008-07-17T03:46:00.000Z	mneptok	owner	Cardbus? v7?
2008-07-17T03:52:00.000Z	mneptok	owner	is this Linksys a Cardbus device? v7 of the card?
