2011-01-27T00:04:00.000Z	abstrakt		but I could see my /var/www growing further, like 5-10G
2011-01-27T00:04:00.000Z	abstrakt		probably not though
2011-01-27T00:05:00.000Z	abstrakt		is /var sharable across different systems? like say I want to have 2 or 3 root partitions and one home partition (or a home and a var partition)
2011-01-27T00:05:00.000Z	abstrakt		so that I can have e.g. Ubuntu 10.04 and Ubuntu 10.10
2011-01-27T00:06:00.000Z	abstrakt		i.e. so that I can install the new Ubuntu when it comes out without wiping my old one
2011-01-27T00:06:00.000Z	abstrakt		and say, a third root partition to play with other distros for fun, like Arch or Fedora or whatever
2011-01-27T00:06:00.000Z	tsimpson	abstrakt	why have a shared /var at all?
2011-01-27T00:06:00.000Z	abstrakt	tsimpson	well, if all my web projects (what I get paid for) live in /var/www then that's a reason
2011-01-27T00:07:00.000Z	tsimpson	abstrakt	it'd probably be better to bind mount a var/www on another partition to /var/www than share a /var
2011-01-27T00:08:00.000Z	abstrakt	tsimpson	ok, yeah you're probably right
2011-01-27T00:08:00.000Z	abstrakt	tsimpson	I personally figured that sharing /var sounded like a bad idea, and you have confirmed that (I think), so thanks :)
2011-01-27T00:09:00.000Z	tsimpson	abstrakt	I'd be especially concerned about /var/lib, things in there are package/library version specific
2011-01-27T00:10:00.000Z	tsimpson	abstrakt	and the fact that that's where dpkg stores the list of installed packages (which will be different on other releases/distros)
2011-01-27T00:10:00.000Z	abstrakt	tsimpson	cool, good to know
2011-01-27T00:11:00.000Z	abstrakt	tsimpson	the only other main thought I have though is what about /home, seems to me that lots of stuff in /home is version specific too no?
2011-01-27T00:12:00.000Z	abstrakt	tsimpson	like .pidgin .gimp .whatever are probably fairly specific to versions and versions change between releases and between distros
2011-01-27T00:13:00.000Z	tsimpson	abstrakt	you do have to be careful, yes. but (generally) most GUI apps don't change their config too much very often
2011-01-27T00:17:00.000Z	tsimpson	abstrakt	if you want to hibernate to disk, than 1.5xRAM is good, otherwise somewhere around 1GB is a general recommendation
