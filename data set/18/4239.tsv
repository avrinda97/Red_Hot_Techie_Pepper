2009-05-25T00:08:00.000Z	Kalmi	th0r	that's a link-local ipv6 address....
2009-05-25T00:09:00.000Z	th0r	Kalmi	right...we are trying to access it locally via the router
2009-05-25T00:09:00.000Z	th0r	Kalmi	but I have never used ipv6...not sure how to handle it
2009-05-25T00:11:00.000Z	Kalmi	th0r	are you running Ubuntu? if you do, than you have a link-local ipv6 address assign to each of your interfaces staring with fe80
2009-05-25T00:12:00.000Z	Kalmi	th0r	are you running Ubuntu? if you do, than you have a link-local ipv6 address assigned to each of your interfaces staring with fe8
2009-05-25T00:12:00.000Z	th0r	Kalmi	right...but I have never paid any attention to them. And now we have an eth0 that has no ipv4, so I am having to figure out how to do things with ipv6 <smile>
2009-05-25T00:12:00.000Z	th0r	Kalmi	for instance...just learned there is a ping6
2009-05-25T00:14:00.000Z	Kalmi	th0r	QuiltPants: why couldn't you just assign ipv4 addresses to the machines?
2009-05-25T00:15:00.000Z	th0r	Kalmi	yeah...he is going to have to do that to keep it all working, but righ tnow we can't even be sure he can get the two to talk
2009-05-25T00:18:00.000Z	th0r	Kalmi	yes...the same lan
2009-05-25T00:19:00.000Z	th0r	Kalmi	but he has a whizbang firewall/router that is not going to be so easy to configure. Couldn't find the user manual online
2009-05-25T00:20:00.000Z	Kalmi	th0r	what make you think that his router is *special*?
2009-05-25T00:21:00.000Z	th0r	Kalmi	it is a Billion 800VGT...not just a linksys or a belkin
2009-05-25T00:22:00.000Z	Kalmi	th0r	seems like a perfectly normal broadband router to me...
2009-05-25T00:22:00.000Z	th0r	Kalmi	did you find a manual online for it?
2009-05-25T00:23:00.000Z	Kalmi	th0r	no... but I found a description....
2009-07-09T07:19:00.000Z	Kalmi	th0r	he got no window decorations
2009-07-09T07:20:00.000Z	th0r	Kalmi	right, either he isn't running a window manager or the one he is running is corrupted somehow
