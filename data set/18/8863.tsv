2007-06-13T14:58:00.000Z	Elipsn		Hey guys, I'm fairly new to linux, but have picked up a lot in the past day or so, I've beat the GTS8800 Blackscreen problem, I've got nvidia drivers working great, beryl is installed and looks awesome, nexuiz runs flawlessly, but I have a few questions....
2007-06-13T14:59:00.000Z	Elipsn		I can't seem to get my center button on my mouse to work, its a G5 Rev.2, or any of the side buttons for that matter
2007-06-13T14:59:00.000Z	tovella	Elipsn	ask away.
2007-06-13T15:00:00.000Z	tovella	Elipsn	it's been so long since i've seen an actual 3button mouse.  is yours used to scroll?
2007-06-13T15:00:00.000Z	Elipsn	tovella	Yes.
2007-06-13T15:00:00.000Z	tovella	Elipsn	let me do some checking...
2007-06-13T15:01:00.000Z	Elipsn	tovella	thanks
2007-06-13T15:02:00.000Z	Elipsn	tovella	I dont really need *all* the buttons this mouse has to work, I just want to forward and back side buttons to work, and the center button click to work, it scrolls fine, but I want to centerclick auto scroll
2007-06-13T15:03:00.000Z	tovella	Elipsn	you said it's on a mac G5?
2007-06-13T15:04:00.000Z	Elipsn	tovella	its a logitech G5 rev.2 mouse
2007-06-13T15:04:00.000Z	tovella	Elipsn	i see...
2007-06-13T15:04:00.000Z	Elipsn		sorry, should have clarified
2007-06-13T15:05:00.000Z	Elipsn	tovella	I remember seeing something about the mouse config inside of "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg", might that have something to do with it?
2007-06-13T15:05:00.000Z	tovella	Elipsn	perhaps.
2007-06-13T15:06:00.000Z	tovella	Elipsn	actually, i think it only has one question about whether or not you want to emulate a 3 button mouse with a 2 button device.
2007-06-13T15:07:00.000Z	Elipsn	tovella	I can't remember what I told it, I think i'll run it again and see what I can do
2007-06-13T15:07:00.000Z	tovella	Elipsn	can you open a terminal window?
2007-06-13T15:07:00.000Z	Elipsn	tovella	done
