2011-04-03T03:11:00.000Z	Jasonn		How do I make my computer use a certain network adapter as the default
2011-04-03T03:12:00.000Z	cfedde	Jasonn	make sure that interface has the defualt route.
2011-04-03T03:12:00.000Z	Jasonn	cfedde	And how do I do that?
2011-04-03T03:15:00.000Z	Jasonn	cfedde	^^
2011-04-03T03:15:00.000Z	Jasonn	cfedde	HOw do i make it use the default route?
2011-04-03T03:16:00.000Z	cfedde	Jasonn	are both interfaces on the same broadcast domain?
2011-04-03T03:17:00.000Z	Jasonn	cfedde	One is a hamachi connection, and i want to use that "adapter" as the default one to connect to the internet with, I already have the proxy set up on the server. Also, I have to connect to a wireless network in order to use the VPN, so its kind of tough
2011-04-03T03:19:00.000Z	cfedde	Jasonn	you can do it using the route command. Include the interface name in the argument list.
2011-04-03T03:20:00.000Z	cfedde	Jasonn	it can also be done in the interfaces file.
2011-04-03T03:20:00.000Z	Jasonn	cfedde	so route CONNECTIONNAME and then what, I only want google chrome to use it
2011-04-03T03:20:00.000Z	Jasonn	cfedde	Actually, any prog can use it, just i need to connect to the internet in order for this to work, so i want that to happen too
2011-04-03T03:20:00.000Z	cfedde	Jasonn	route delete default...; route add default ... ehth or something.
2011-04-03T03:22:00.000Z	Jasonn	cfedde	BUT it WILL still connect to the internet to enable hamachi?
2011-04-03T03:23:00.000Z	cfedde	Jasonn	I'm not that familar with hamachi. iirc it creates a virtual interface.  use that one as the default route and all non local traffic will go over that interface.
2011-04-03T03:24:00.000Z	Jasonn	cfedde	Thanks :)
2011-04-03T03:26:00.000Z	Jasonn	cfedde	SO if i want it to use ham0 then, what command should I use?
2011-04-03T03:26:00.000Z	cfedde	Jasonn	let me go read the route(1) manual for you.
2011-04-03T03:27:00.000Z	Jasonn	cfedde	Thanks :)\
