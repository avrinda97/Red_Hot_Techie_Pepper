2006-06-20T13:38:00.000Z	MystaMax		oh my gosh, How do I stop Shift-backspace from taking me back to the login screen
2006-06-20T13:39:00.000Z	NoUse	MystaMax	read the xgl howtos
2006-06-20T13:39:00.000Z	MystaMax	NoUse	so its XGL related?
2006-06-20T13:39:00.000Z	NoUse	MystaMax	yeah its a bug in compiz
2006-06-20T13:40:00.000Z	MystaMax	NoUse	what howto are you referring to? Thanks for the lead though
2006-06-20T13:41:00.000Z	NoUse	MystaMax	try this ' xmodmap /usr/share/xmodmap/xmodmap.us' if your country code is us of course
2006-06-20T13:41:00.000Z	MystaMax	NoUse	ok checkin now, brb
2006-06-20T13:42:00.000Z	MystaMax	NoUse	should I get any feed back? Should I be looking @ this via NANO or gedit?
2006-06-20T13:42:00.000Z	NoUse	MystaMax	no just run that
2006-06-20T13:43:00.000Z	MystaMax	NoUse	it worked! no more restarting. May I ask what that command did?
2006-06-20T13:44:00.000Z	NoUse	MystaMax	that should fix the problem, you should also add that command to the command tha initializes compiz
2006-06-20T13:44:00.000Z	NoUse	MystaMax	I think it reset X's key bindings
2006-06-20T13:59:00.000Z	MystaMax	NoUse	this may not be a viable solution, it seems I can't use any keyboard shortcuts @ all
2006-06-20T14:00:00.000Z	NoUse	MystaMax	thats the solution for that bug, I don't use xgl so ask for more help in #ubuntu-xgl

2006-06-20T14:40:00.000Z	NoUse	MystaMax	yes
