2012-02-27T19:31:00.000Z	satyanash	MonkeyDust	I need the Data directory.. not the binary location.
2012-02-27T19:31:00.000Z	satyanash	MonkeyDust	I want to unzip a zip file to it's data directory so as to patch it.
2012-03-09T00:08:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	satyanash	 you want two window managers simultaneously?
2012-03-09T00:09:00.000Z	satyanash	MonkeyDust	yes.
2012-03-09T00:10:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	satyanash	 try ctrl-alt F1 and then run a very light window manager
2012-03-09T00:10:00.000Z	satyanash	MonkeyDust	?
2012-03-09T00:10:00.000Z	satyanash	MonkeyDust	it'll just complain that gdm is already running.
2012-03-09T00:10:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	satyanash	 idd
2012-03-09T00:12:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	satyanash	 i use two monitors, too, as we speak, but the second monitor is just the stretched out first monitor
2012-03-09T00:12:00.000Z	satyanash	MonkeyDust	Yea, I don't want that.
2012-03-09T00:13:00.000Z	satyanash	MonkeyDust	because, when I press ctrl+alt+Up, both the screens would change to reflect whatever exists in the upper workspace.
2012-03-09T00:13:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	satyanash	 what i'm saying is: it's just one monitor, behaving like if it were two, but it still is just one
2012-03-09T00:16:00.000Z	satyanash	MonkeyDust	What I dont want is: Something equal to running two computers on a single computer. controlled by the same mouse and keyboards. But displaying on 2 separate screens.
