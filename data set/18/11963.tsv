2010-10-02T08:08:00.000Z	tristan_		ill nmap you.
2010-10-02T08:08:00.000Z	tristan_		tis a bit slow. 5 mins remaining
2010-10-02T08:08:00.000Z	tristan_		but:
2010-10-02T08:08:00.000Z	tristan_		does your ubuntu box have a private or public address added.
2010-10-02T08:09:00.000Z	tristan_		like a 192/172/10.* or routable
2010-10-02T08:09:00.000Z	tristan_		ten four
2010-10-02T08:09:00.000Z	tristan_		he should be protected already.
2010-10-02T08:09:00.000Z	tristan_		at least from the big bad world outside.
2010-10-02T08:09:00.000Z	tristan_		shit spreading in your lan is outside the scope of this.
2010-10-02T08:10:00.000Z	tristan_		4 mins left
2010-10-02T08:10:00.000Z	bobstro	tristan_	 depending on what's forwarded. it looks like some stuff is.
2010-10-02T08:10:00.000Z	bobstro	tristan_	 surely no harm in knowing for sure, and not assuming?
2010-10-02T08:14:00.000Z	bobstro	tristan_	 sourcing scan from port 53 might be interesting
2010-10-02T08:24:00.000Z	tristan_	bobstro	howd you scan
2010-10-02T08:25:00.000Z	bobstro	tristan_	 i usually do -sT since stealth is so readily blocked.
2010-10-02T08:25:00.000Z	bobstro	tristan_	 plus it sets off alarm bells (though a scan usually does anyhow)
2010-10-02T08:25:00.000Z	bobstro	tristan_	 i didn't get that!
2010-10-02T08:26:00.000Z	bobstro	tristan_	 interesting. i did use --source-port 53.
