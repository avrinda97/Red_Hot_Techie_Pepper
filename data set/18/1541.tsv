2011-01-26T03:20:00.000Z	repgahroll		hey... i know it isn't the right place to ask, but i couldn't get much help anywhere... i'm using eclipse+pydev, and my program works fine from the editor, but when i try to run it from terminal, i get a lot of error. I've tried to reproduce the command that is called by pydev, but i doesn't work. can someone help e please?
2011-01-26T03:22:00.000Z	sageb1	repgahroll	what's the first error?
2011-01-26T03:24:00.000Z	repgahroll	sageb1	the problem is that i can convert qstring to pystring like str(qstring), and it runs fine from eclipse, but it doesn't from terminal, to get this part working on terminal, i have to do str(qstring.toUtf8()).
2011-01-26T03:24:00.000Z	repgahroll	sageb1	but this isn't the only problem. when i fix one another appears, and so on.
2011-01-26T03:26:00.000Z	sageb1	repgahroll	sounds like you haven't printed out the program and gone over it with highlighter to see how it works.
2011-01-26T03:26:00.000Z	sageb1	repgahroll	hence the errors
2011-01-26T03:29:00.000Z	repgahroll	sageb1	what do you mean with "printed out the program"? thanks
2011-01-26T03:32:00.000Z	sageb1	repgahroll	the fact is, a printout hardcopy of a program helps alot in debugging the logical structure that may be broken by fixing on programming error in it
2011-01-26T03:33:00.000Z	sageb1	repgahroll	how long is your pyqt4 program in # of lines?
2011-01-26T03:34:00.000Z	sageb1	repgahroll	you just need to print out the lines of the function where the error is.
2011-01-26T03:44:00.000Z	sageb1	repgahroll	have you discovered the logical error in your script?
2011-01-26T03:51:00.000Z	repgahroll	sageb1	sorry the delay. my program has 2k lines, i don't understand... if it runs fine from pydev, i think there should be no error. i just want to run it the same way outside pydev.
2011-01-26T03:52:00.000Z	sageb1	repgahroll	ok that's a big program.  have you used pylint on it?
2011-01-26T03:52:00.000Z	repgahroll	sageb1	nope.
2011-01-26T03:58:00.000Z	repgahroll	sageb1	at the resulting command-line, there's a configuration called "The PYTHONPATH that will be used" maybe i need to reproduce this setting on terminal?
2011-01-26T03:59:00.000Z	sageb1	repgahroll	YES
2011-01-26T04:00:00.000Z	repgahroll	sageb1	ok. thank you. i'm gonna try to reproduce that setting.
2011-01-26T04:01:00.000Z	sageb1	repgahroll	yw
