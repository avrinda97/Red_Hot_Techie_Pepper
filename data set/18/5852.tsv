2008-09-21T01:33:00.000Z	HexKey		How do i boot from my ubuntu live CD, grub just laods its screen and i cant see an option to boot from CD
2008-09-21T01:35:00.000Z	guntbert	HexKey	does your PC boot from CD at all?
2008-09-21T01:36:00.000Z	HexKey		i have the grub menu up but there is no boot from CD option guntbert
2008-09-21T01:37:00.000Z	guntbert	HexKey	when you see the grub-menu from your harddisk, its too late for the CD, have a look at the system-bios, boot-sequence
2008-09-21T01:37:00.000Z	HexKey		i prss F12 at start upto show the boot menu, but it only displays grub
2008-09-21T01:38:00.000Z	guntbert	HexKey	can you boot from another CD?
