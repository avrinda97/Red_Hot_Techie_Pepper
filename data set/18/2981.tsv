2010-07-17T09:53:00.000Z	arjunak01		burg themes are not working, ive installed burg and burg-themes packages but burg is not responding to key presses (t)
2010-07-17T09:55:00.000Z	sebsebseb	arjunak01	Why did you do Burg?
2010-07-17T09:55:00.000Z	arjunak01		sebsebseb:because of its themes
2010-07-17T09:55:00.000Z	sebsebseb	arjunak01	How did you find out about it?  Also you can do background images for Grub 2 by the way, and quite easilly
2010-07-17T09:56:00.000Z	sebsebseb	arjunak01	and Burg is not stable
2010-07-17T09:56:00.000Z	arjunak01	sebsebseb	i wont mind
2010-07-17T09:56:00.000Z	sebsebseb	arjunak01	won't mind what?
2010-07-17T09:56:00.000Z	arjunak01	sebsebseb	stability
2010-07-17T09:57:00.000Z	sebsebseb	arjunak01	oh I am sure you would, if you can't boot up your OS
2010-07-17T09:57:00.000Z	arjunak01	sebsebseb	i will use a live cd to restore grub
2010-07-17T09:57:00.000Z	sebsebseb	arjunak01	and the chance of that happening with Burg is much more likely than with Grub 2 or the old Grub
2010-07-17T09:57:00.000Z	arjunak01	sebsebseb	ive installed burg and it works, but im unable to use themes
2010-07-17T09:57:00.000Z	sebsebseb	arjunak01	hardly anyone uses Burg by the way,  and  I don't think it is supported as such in this channel, since not default,  and not even in the Ubuntu repo I think
2010-07-17T09:58:00.000Z	arjunak01	sebsebseb	but it looks great
2010-07-17T09:58:00.000Z	arjunak01	sebsebseb	grub2 only supports background images
2010-07-17T10:00:00.000Z	sebsebseb	arjunak01	This may be useful though http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2010/07/burg-boot-loader-installation-themeing.html
