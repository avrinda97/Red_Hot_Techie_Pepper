2009-03-12T05:42:00.000Z	corey		Is there a type of RAID that will spread my data out accross several diffently sized drives to minimize impact incase of drive failure?
2009-03-12T05:44:00.000Z	g0nad	corey	you can use raid 5, if you have an 80gb 80gb and say 120gb, it will use the lowest size drive
2009-03-12T05:44:00.000Z	corey	g0nad	will I be able to use the left over space
2009-03-12T05:44:00.000Z	g0nad	corey	no
2009-03-12T05:45:00.000Z	corey	g0nad	why cant the left over space be used as a normal partition?
2009-03-12T05:45:00.000Z	g0nad	corey	just can't, dunno specifics
2009-03-12T05:46:00.000Z	corey	g0nad	I have 3 80gb 2 250gb and 2 160gb that I want to use. What is the best configuration?

2009-03-12T05:48:00.000Z	g0nad	corey	i would raid the 3 80's together, raid 5, then raid the 2 160's and a 250 in a raid 5, gonna lose alot of space though :/
2009-03-12T05:49:00.000Z	corey	g0nad	as soon as i get a steady job i am going to purchase a terabyte or so
2009-03-12T05:54:00.000Z	corey	g0nad	i think i will just ditch the 80gb drives and RAID 5 the 160's and 250's
2009-03-12T05:54:00.000Z	g0nad	corey	that would give you around 320gb
2009-03-12T05:54:00.000Z	corey	g0nad	by the time I fill those up I will be able to purchase a few dozen tb
2009-03-12T05:55:00.000Z	corey	g0nad	that would give me 480gb
2009-03-12T05:55:00.000Z	corey	g0nad	Storage capacity *(N-1)
2009-03-12T05:56:00.000Z	g0nad	corey	i have no idea what that is suppose to mean
2009-03-12T06:16:00.000Z	g0nad	corey	you would have to move data off those drives before raiding them, it will initialize them
2009-03-12T06:17:00.000Z	corey	g0nad	thats just wonderfull...
