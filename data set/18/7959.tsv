2009-07-10T23:28:00.000Z	DPic		To help get my school to use Ubuntu on more machines, i was going to start offering conversions for teacher's who volunteered their school laptops. I was given two of the schools oldest laptops to test xubuntu with (if it works on these, it should work on the newer ones), but the resolution is set too low and i can't change it.Â 
2009-07-10T23:29:00.000Z	DPic		i've tried https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Config/Resolution
2009-07-10T23:29:00.000Z	DPic		i just can't get it to work

2009-07-10T23:30:00.000Z	DPic	TwoD	thanks, but i'm just looking to fix this display problem
2009-07-10T23:31:00.000Z	DPic	TwoD	yeah
2009-07-10T23:32:00.000Z	TwoD	DPic	try to do it logged out of X
2009-07-10T23:32:00.000Z	DPic	TwoD	i tried it logged in and restarting didn't work, and i followed the instructions on the wiki to do it logged out of X and it still didn't work
2009-07-10T23:34:00.000Z	DPic	TwoD	generic. max resolution is like 800 by 600 when it needs to be like 1024 by 768 or something
