2006-10-10T11:12:00.000Z	sykes^		So I can just use Ubuntu Desktop from the CD to see if I like it? (and learn something about linux)
2006-10-10T11:12:00.000Z	Dr_willis	sykes^	 the live cd is a bit slower then an installed system. but very useable.
2006-10-10T11:13:00.000Z	Dr_willis	sykes^	 theres other live linux cd's that may be a little better done.. but they are all fun toplay with.
2006-10-10T11:13:00.000Z	sykes^		Aight. And if I choose to install it, will Wine X work under it?
2006-10-10T11:13:00.000Z	sykes^		Need to use Steam ^^
2006-10-10T11:14:00.000Z	Dr_willis		Skygge__,  you aont going to be doing much gaming/instaling from the live cd.. If you install the system - you can try. BUT really for the best in games for the hard-core-alcoholic-addicted gamer. i have to say stick with windows and dual boot.
2006-10-10T11:15:00.000Z	Dr_willis		Grr wrong nick. :P

2006-10-10T11:15:00.000Z	Dr_willis		The Steam Games/system just sort of ticked me off. :)
2006-10-10T11:16:00.000Z	sykes^	Dr_willis	so running windows games under linux sucks donkey *****?
2006-10-10T11:16:00.000Z	Dr_willis	sykes^	 it all depends. and theres a LOT of things it depends on.  RUnning windows games under windows - is quickly becoming a HUGE hassle also.
