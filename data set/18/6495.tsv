2008-05-05T09:35:00.000Z	dnd		hi all is there a comparable package in Gnome for KPPP?  I bought this stupid internet card from the store and it says to use KPPP but in Gnome this package doesn't exist and if I don't have it I can't get on line to get it?  any help?
2008-05-05T09:36:00.000Z	Bradipo	dnd	did you try searching "ppp" in synaptic?
2008-05-05T09:37:00.000Z	dnd	Bradipo	Yep, found several packages.. including some wvdialer.. but that refuses to work for me complains it can't find my modem...
2008-05-05T09:42:00.000Z	Bradipo	dnd	if the modem really is installed, it should appear in network manager
2008-05-05T09:43:00.000Z	dnd	Bradipo	Sorry I'm not following how that will help me to "Dial up"
2008-05-05T09:43:00.000Z	Bradipo	dnd	also, you could download and save the kppp package to a mass storage device, and install it from there
2008-05-05T09:45:00.000Z	Bradipo	dnd	in gnome network manager you can also set dialing options, HOWEVER I'd really recommend doing the command line thing somebody suggested to you
2008-05-05T09:47:00.000Z	dnd	Bradipo	ok, one more question where is the package cache?
2008-05-05T09:48:00.000Z	Bradipo	dnd	the important thing is that you just get them all, there is a graphical installer in gnome (Gdebi) that you can use from nautilus
2008-05-05T09:48:00.000Z	Bradipo	dnd	Gdebi won't let you mess it up
2008-05-05T09:49:00.000Z	dnd	Bradipo	ok I understand that but after I get them downloaded and put on my flash how do I get them into the new Ubuntu install?
2008-05-05T09:50:00.000Z	dnd	Bradipo	Remembering that till I get KPP up and going.. I have no internet.
2008-05-05T09:50:00.000Z	Bradipo	dnd	you log in your ubuntu install, and with nautilus navigate to the folder where you saved them
2008-05-05T09:50:00.000Z	dnd	Bradipo	so It will find all the dep's  as long as they are all in the same folder?
2008-05-05T09:51:00.000Z	Bradipo	dnd	it won't let you install a library if you miss the dependencies, so in the worst case you will be forced to install each package in the proper order
2008-05-05T09:52:00.000Z	Bradipo	dnd	by trial and error, you know... :)
2008-05-05T09:52:00.000Z	dnd	Bradipo	ok well wish me Luck I'm off :)
2008-05-05T09:53:00.000Z	Bradipo	dnd	good luck!
