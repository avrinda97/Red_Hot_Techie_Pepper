2007-08-18T08:34:00.000Z	Oliazk		question -- is there anyway i can make a new /etc/network/interface file?
2007-08-18T08:35:00.000Z	Oliazk		feel the same
2007-08-18T08:36:00.000Z	Oliazk		if i had money i would get a different minipci card but i am broke
2007-08-18T08:36:00.000Z	Oliazk		does anyone have a clean /etc/network/interfaces file?
2007-08-18T08:36:00.000Z	Oliazk		well not empty but yeah
2007-08-18T08:38:00.000Z	Oliazk		hmm i see i will try cause my lo is missing
2007-08-18T08:39:00.000Z	Oliazk		i am so happy i have multiple computers even if they are not all great
2007-08-18T08:40:00.000Z	Oliazk		yeah i usually leave this old laptop runing irc and pidgin
2007-08-18T08:42:00.000Z	Oliazk		does anyone know of a guide for rt2500 that possibly works with festy fawn?
2007-08-18T08:43:00.000Z	vocx	Oliazk	what about the rt2x00 rt2500 drivers, I thought they were open source.
2007-08-18T08:43:00.000Z	Oliazk	vocx	i havent been able to even connect to my network using them
2007-08-18T08:43:00.000Z	Oliazk	vocx	though i could be doing something wrong
2007-08-18T08:44:00.000Z	vocx	Oliazk	maybe you need updated firmwares. And what about ndiswrapper?
2007-08-18T08:45:00.000Z	Oliazk	vocx	firmware i not sure about havent seen anything about firmware update on the ralink site
2007-08-18T08:46:00.000Z	Oliazk	vocx	and niswrapper i havent tried
2007-08-18T08:47:00.000Z	Oliazk	vocx	i was going to try ndiswrapper next but i dont really want to
2007-08-18T08:47:00.000Z	vocx	Oliazk	I wouldn't follow so closely the Ralink site. I have more confidence in Ubuntu guides in the wiki pages or ubuntuforums.org information.
2007-08-18T08:50:00.000Z	Oliazk	vocx	the only thing i follow on that site might be the downloads for drivers
