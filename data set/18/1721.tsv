2011-02-15T04:59:00.000Z	ChogyDan	induz	what's wrong?
2011-02-15T04:59:00.000Z	induz	ChogyDan	can u suggest me which one is better?
2011-02-15T05:00:00.000Z	induz	ChogyDan	 I have posted both
2011-02-15T05:01:00.000Z	ChogyDan	induz	I see.  What is your goal?  The second one gives access to some third party software, and is more organized.  Both will work though.  You should probably just use the GUI
2011-02-15T05:03:00.000Z	ChogyDan	induz	from the cli: gksu software-properties-gtk
2011-02-15T05:04:00.000Z	induz	ChogyDan	what that command would do?
2011-02-15T05:05:00.000Z	ChogyDan	induz	it is the GUI
2011-02-15T05:07:00.000Z	induz	ChogyDan	it says Could not download all repository indexes
2011-02-15T05:08:00.000Z	ChogyDan	induz	doesn't really matter, but you can uncheck the repository that is doing that
2011-02-15T05:08:00.000Z	induz	ChogyDan	 its medibuntu GPG error: http://packages.medibuntu.org lucid Release: The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available:
2011-02-15T05:09:00.000Z	ChogyDan	induz	don't use medibuntu unless you need it?
2011-02-15T05:10:00.000Z	induz	ChogyDan	ok
2011-02-15T05:11:00.000Z	induz	ChogyDan	can i use few lines like #Canonical Commercial Repository from that 2nd list
2011-02-15T05:14:00.000Z	ChogyDan	induz	just check off what you want in the GUI
2011-02-15T05:15:00.000Z	induz	ChogyDan	 so most of the repos are there in GUI
