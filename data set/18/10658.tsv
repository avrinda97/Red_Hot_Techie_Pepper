2007-06-16T11:14:00.000Z	Jordan_U	RifleEyes	Still having problems with GRUB?
2007-06-16T11:15:00.000Z	Jordan_U	RifleEyes	Did you try booting from your other drives or making sure that grub is installed on the MBR of the drive that is currently set to boot?
2007-06-16T11:17:00.000Z	Jordan_U	RifleEyes	Just because Ubuntu was installed to a particular drive does not necessarily mean that ubuntu's bootloader, GRUB, was installed to the same drive
2007-06-16T11:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	RifleEyes	GRUB is required to run Ubuntu, it is like ntldr for windows
2007-06-16T11:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	RifleEyes	Have you tried booting from your other drive?
2007-06-16T11:22:00.000Z	Jordan_U	RifleEyes	Set it as the first drive in the boot priority in your boot settings, or press f8 ( it might be a different key depending on your specific BIOS ) at boot for a one time menu
2007-06-16T11:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U	RifleEyes	I would back up your MBR ( just in case ) and install GRUB to the drive you are booting from then
