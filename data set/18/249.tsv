2012-05-23T04:48:00.000Z	Confused2012		Am I in the right place for assistance w/Ubuntu dl and install?
2012-05-23T04:48:00.000Z	escott	Confused2012	yes
2012-05-23T04:51:00.000Z	escott	Confused2012	it is a CD image
2012-05-23T04:53:00.000Z	escott	Confused2012	the install image is just a bit over 700MB
2012-05-23T04:54:00.000Z	escott	Confused2012	open your webbrowsers downloads tool it should be listed there
2012-05-23T04:56:00.000Z	escott	Confused2012	the ubuntu.com website has screenshots with instructions for many common burning applications, nero is probably in that list
2012-05-23T05:00:00.000Z	escott	Confused2012	you might also check if there is a LUG (linux users group) in your area. they might be able to provide you with some known good install disks
2012-05-23T06:44:00.000Z	escott	Confused2012	what is saying it doesn't have 4.4GB?
2012-05-23T06:48:00.000Z	Confused2012	escott	if you posted a response, I missed it.
2012-05-23T06:49:00.000Z	escott	Confused2012	i was asking where are you getting this 4.4gb message. did you boot the install cd?
2012-05-23T06:53:00.000Z	escott	Confused2012	you would have to shrink the windows partition. if there is corruption on the windows (and you intend to keep the windows or keep its data) i would STRONGLY recommend booting a windows rescue CD and fixing the corruption PRIOR to resizing the partition
2012-05-23T06:55:00.000Z	escott	Confused2012	you could delete the windows partition, but you would lose all data on the computer
2012-05-23T06:59:00.000Z	escott	Confused2012	you can go to the livecd (try ubuntu now instead of install ubuntu) and maybe access files (unless the ntfs is too corrupted to even read
2012-05-23T07:02:00.000Z	escott	Confused2012	its called the disk utility
2012-05-23T07:17:00.000Z	escott	Confused2012	hit the windows key and type in a keyword for the program you want to run. like "disk" or "partition"
2012-05-23T07:24:00.000Z	escott	Confused2012	perhaps an older version of ubuntu fit within 4.4GB of free disk space, but not the modern ubuntu
2012-05-23T07:24:00.000Z	escott	Confused2012	hit the windows key and type some keyword like "partition" or "disk"
2012-05-23T07:25:00.000Z	escott	Confused2012	have you attempted what i told you to do?
