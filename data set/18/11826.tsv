2007-01-20T06:54:00.000Z	green-	jrib	ah dont have backports in, let me add that
2007-01-20T07:02:00.000Z	jrib	green-	pastebin your current sources.list
2007-01-20T07:04:00.000Z	green-	jrib	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/2206/
2007-01-20T07:05:00.000Z	jrib	green-	sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree
2007-01-20T07:05:00.000Z	green-	jrib	of course, and the package isn't available...
2007-01-20T07:05:00.000Z	jrib	green-	what architecture are you using?
2007-01-20T07:06:00.000Z	jrib	green-	there is no flash for amd64, there are some workarounds:
2007-01-20T07:07:00.000Z	green-	jrib	so GNU gnash is my only option?
2007-01-20T07:08:00.000Z	jrib	green-	or a chroot
2007-01-20T07:09:00.000Z	jrib	green-	I haven't tried it recently but I think they are aiming to get the features of flash7 only
2007-01-20T07:21:00.000Z	jrib	green-	use a 32bit firefox, that's probably the best option
2007-01-20T07:21:00.000Z	green-	jrib	that's something i can do?
2007-01-20T07:21:00.000Z	jrib	green-	yes, it's on the page I linked you to before
2007-01-20T07:22:00.000Z	jrib	green-	someone else gave you a direct link: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FirefoxAMD64FlashJava
2007-01-20T07:23:00.000Z	green-	jrib	missed it, thanks.
