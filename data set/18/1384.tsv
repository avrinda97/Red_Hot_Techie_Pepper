2011-04-02T01:53:00.000Z	GeekyAdam		does anyone know of a way to reduce an image file's dimensions down until its a certain file size?
2011-04-02T01:54:00.000Z	Polah	GeekyAdam	I don't think you could do that. It could be resized row by row of pixels until it is the desired size
2011-04-02T01:54:00.000Z	GeekyAdam	Polah	:/ i was hoping to avoid that, but it might be only method
2011-04-02T01:55:00.000Z	Polah	GeekyAdam	It would really depend on the contents of the image. For example a 1000x1000 plain white image is obviously a smaller size since it has no real information
2011-04-02T01:55:00.000Z	GeekyAdam	Polah	right. im just doing your basic "reduce image filesize for website upload" stuff
2011-04-02T01:55:00.000Z	GeekyAdam	Polah	so i was hoping for a method that would apply to any image
2011-04-02T01:56:00.000Z	Polah	GeekyAdam	Don't think so. You could just specify a standard size to resize it to.
2011-04-02T01:56:00.000Z	GeekyAdam	Polah	thx for the info
2011-04-02T02:08:00.000Z	Polah	GeekyAdam	OpenJDK is open source, Sun Java is proprietary and requires enabling of the Canonical partners repository. Either one works fine I find.
2011-04-02T02:09:00.000Z	GeekyAdam	Polah	thx
2011-04-02T02:11:00.000Z	GeekyAdam	Polah	openjdk-6-jre or openjdk-6-jdk? normal non-dev desktop use
2011-04-02T02:12:00.000Z	Polah	GeekyAdam	openjdk-6-jre
2011-04-02T02:12:00.000Z	GeekyAdam	Polah	thx
2011-04-02T02:13:00.000Z	Polah	GeekyAdam	correct. JRE = Java Runtime Environment, JDK = Java Development Kit.
2011-04-02T02:14:00.000Z	GeekyAdam	Polah	says its already the newest version, so why cant i see java applets in firefox? fresh ubuntu install. is there something else i need to install for java web applets to work? (do link is fine)
2011-04-02T02:14:00.000Z	Polah	GeekyAdam	get ubuntu-restricted-extras. OpenJDK comes by default but not the Firefox plugin
2011-04-02T02:15:00.000Z	GeekyAdam	Polah	thx
2011-04-02T02:15:00.000Z	GeekyAdam	Polah	gotcha will do
