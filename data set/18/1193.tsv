2011-05-01T21:07:00.000Z	katejones		I can't install, and I can't boot into the Live Ubuntu on USB either.. would really like to install Ubuntu and get rid of XP.. can anyone help?
2011-05-01T21:08:00.000Z	IdleOne	katejones	you are using 11.04 Live CD?
2011-05-01T21:09:00.000Z	katejones	IdleOne	: 11.04 on live USB stick, small netboox doesn't have cd drive but I can boot from usb. Installed it with the Universal USB installer on the USB stick, no errors
2011-05-01T21:10:00.000Z	IdleOne	katejones	ok so you were able to create the USB install without error but it still won't boot to Ubuntu?
2011-05-01T21:14:00.000Z	IdleOne	katejones	let's hope for the best.
2011-05-01T22:37:00.000Z	katejones	IdleOne	- I put the Alternative Ubuntu on my USB, that won't boot at all..?
2011-05-01T22:38:00.000Z	IdleOne	katejones	don't know how else to help. restate the problem you are having and someone else might have an idea.
2011-05-01T22:44:00.000Z	katejones	IdleOne	: Kojinsha notebook, 11.04 Alternative om USB, I het the installer boot menu but can't choose anything there (it reloads the boot choice screen except fro on ''test memory' 'which it starts to do)
2011-05-01T22:50:00.000Z	katejones	IdleOne	- thanks for the help.. I think Ill just give up and stick to XP on this notebook, must be incompatible or something...
2011-05-01T22:50:00.000Z	IdleOne	katejones	sorry I was not more help.
2011-05-01T22:50:00.000Z	IdleOne	katejones	good to hear.
2011-05-01T22:51:00.000Z	katejones	IdleOne	- so dad has to stick with slow XP, I've had it with trying ;)
2011-05-01T22:51:00.000Z	IdleOne	katejones	maybe try with 10.10?
2011-05-01T22:52:00.000Z	katejones	IdleOne	- Do you think that might work better? Ok, that's the last thing I'll try then. it's a weird small netbook though, touchscreen..
2011-05-01T22:52:00.000Z	IdleOne	katejones	don't know for sure but worth a try.
2011-05-01T22:52:00.000Z	katejones	IdleOne	- thanks!
