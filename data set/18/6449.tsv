2008-12-05T04:02:00.000Z	Izinucs	ActionParsnip	I gave him that link earlier.. I think he's expecting linux to be like windows and not yet open to learning a new way.
2008-12-05T04:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Izinucs	ok
2008-12-05T04:02:00.000Z	Izinucs	ActionParsnip	just FYI.. If he'll listen to you more than me.. go for it.
2008-12-05T04:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Izinucs	we'll see
2008-12-05T04:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Izinucs	looks like me pasting the link is beter than you pasting it :(
2008-12-05T04:05:00.000Z	Izinucs	ActionParsnip	just had to hammer it into him twice I guess..
2008-12-05T04:05:00.000Z	Izinucs	ActionParsnip	remember me?  Izinucs = Scunizi.. :)
2008-12-05T04:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Izinucs	i remember few names
2010-06-12T06:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Izinucs	both use standard irc commands, so both are equally easy
2010-06-12T06:50:00.000Z	Izinucs	ActionParsnip	isn't gaim now know as something else? like Pidgin
2010-06-12T06:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Izinucs	true
2010-06-12T06:51:00.000Z	Izinucs	ActionParsnip	which is a great IM client but if he's using "gaim" then he's on an old release and needs a little coaxing.. I don't think gaim has the same irc plugins that Pidgin has currently
2010-10-02T21:50:00.000Z	Izinucs	ActionParsnip	Solved has been working on this since last night.. doesn't want to install to /.. also playdeb.net has the latest version.. repos are out of date
2010-10-02T21:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Izinucs	the file Solved is using is tremulous-1.1.0-installer.x86.run   if you run: apt-cache policy tremulous , you will see it's 1.1.0-4.1build1 0   so the .run file is out of date too?
2010-10-02T21:52:00.000Z	Izinucs	ActionParsnip	I guess it's the latest stable.. there is a 1.2 beta out
2010-10-02T21:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Izinucs	the user is trying to install the stable, which is in the repo
2010-10-02T21:53:00.000Z	Izinucs	ActionParsnip	usually the repos are out of date for games.. but he did download direct
2010-10-02T21:53:00.000Z	Izinucs	ActionParsnip	I agree.. installing from the repo is much easier
