2011-11-11T03:26:00.000Z	foolove		I have no method yet traditionally just gzcat filename.gz | grep string1 | grep string2 | grep string3 > /searchdirectory/filename.log
2011-11-11T03:27:00.000Z	foolove		i know zgrep but i do zgrep -i pattern1 pattern2 pattern3 filename.gz > outputfile.log
2011-11-11T03:28:00.000Z	foolove		i get not love the thing i need to bypass with my command
2011-11-11T03:28:00.000Z	foolove		is the case sensitivity of the filename
2011-11-11T03:28:00.000Z	foolove		filename.gz
2011-11-11T03:28:00.000Z	foolove		i need to bypass case sensitivity of the input ifle
2011-11-11T03:28:00.000Z	foolove		file
2011-11-11T03:28:00.000Z	foolove		zgrep -i jus tdoes ignore case on pattern
2011-11-11T03:29:00.000Z	foolove		file not found
2011-11-11T03:29:00.000Z	foolove		so it is case sensitive
2011-11-11T03:29:00.000Z	apwbdjp	foolove	yes it is, Linux is. What are you trying to accomplish exactly?
2011-11-11T03:29:00.000Z	foolove		through hash key value pairs in my code the 200 plus list i was sent the wrong filenames i do not want to go back through these
2011-11-11T03:30:00.000Z	foolove		that is a lot of redoing im trying to come up with a work around the code generates a long command based on variables i parse in another program in my code
2011-11-11T03:30:00.000Z	foolove		then the end output is a long command if i can pass parameters in my command to overlook case sensitivity of the filename for the command im good to go
2011-11-11T03:32:00.000Z	apwbdjp	foolove	whoa.. I guess you do have a bit of an issue here.. it's pretty tricky
2011-11-11T03:32:00.000Z	foolove	apwbdjp	indeed i do  :) .....I am glad you understand my issue though and at least sense some of my pain
2011-11-11T03:33:00.000Z	foolove		so find -iname filname.gz then how would i pass gzcat to that just pipe it jrib? i need to build a list off of find
2011-11-11T03:35:00.000Z	apwbdjp	foolove	know about the `command` syntax?
