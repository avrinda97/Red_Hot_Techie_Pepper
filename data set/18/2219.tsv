2010-07-16T22:36:00.000Z	quickhelper	ajin	if both are running ssh, you can sftp between them
2010-07-16T22:36:00.000Z	ajin	quickhelper	one doesn't have ssh
2010-07-16T22:37:00.000Z	ajin	quickhelper	I do like to tftp bitween them
2010-07-16T22:38:00.000Z	ajin	quickhelper	slinker1 violinappren The problem is that one is a SBC :-)
2010-07-16T22:38:00.000Z	quickhelper	ajin	SBC doesn't protocol block ssh
2010-07-16T22:39:00.000Z	ajin	quickhelper	I'm trying to do it from the boot shell
2010-07-16T22:39:00.000Z	ajin	quickhelper	no ssh
2010-07-16T22:39:00.000Z	ajin	quickhelper	and it is impossible
2010-07-16T22:39:00.000Z	quickhelper	ajin	sorry i don't know more, but it looks like u've solved it "it is impossible"
2010-07-16T22:40:00.000Z	ajin	quickhelper	funny :-) but I don;t like jokes
