2007-06-01T13:38:00.000Z	omegacenti		Oy Im having issues with screen resolutions
2007-06-01T13:39:00.000Z	omegacenti		I changed in xorg.conf one of the monitor resolutions to 1280x768, however the resolution is 1024x768. I am using 915resolution and ubuntu edgy.
2007-06-01T13:41:00.000Z	omegacenti		nothing eh?
2007-06-01T13:42:00.000Z	omegacenti		I changed in xorg.conf one of the monitor resolutions to 1280x768, however the resolution is 1024x768. I am using 915resolution and ubuntu edgy. Anyone have any solutions?
2007-06-01T13:42:00.000Z	silent_	omegacenti	make sure you have latest drivers for your video device. When you do you should be able to change the resolution however you like through the system menu
2007-06-01T13:43:00.000Z	omegacenti	silent_	It seems that other users have had this same problem even with the latest drivers.
2007-06-01T13:43:00.000Z	silent_	omegacenti	ATI no doubt?
2007-06-01T13:43:00.000Z	omegacenti	silent_	No, laptop onboard graphics
2007-06-01T13:44:00.000Z	silent_	omegacenti	well that's just weird :P
2007-06-01T13:44:00.000Z	omegacenti	silent_	the intel915 to be exact
2007-06-01T13:45:00.000Z	omegacenti	silent_	Pfft, not as weird as having 1024 768 on a 1280 768 resolution. Its so annoying!!! XD
2007-06-01T13:46:00.000Z	silent_	omegacenti	most machines designed for windows work with linux :P
2007-06-01T13:47:00.000Z	silent_	omegacenti	however there is more support for nvidia graphics accelerators
2007-06-01T13:47:00.000Z	omegacenti	silent_	Then I am one of the unfortunate to test the word, "Most"
2007-06-01T13:48:00.000Z	silent_	omegacenti	my computer components have "made for Windows Vista/XP" all over them, but they run fine.... even my Geforce 8800 works perfectly
2007-06-01T13:48:00.000Z	omegacenti	silent_	Nvidia is known for good support. However, my gateway cx2618 is an entirely different story. I also assume you are talking about your desktop computer?
2007-06-01T13:49:00.000Z	silent_	omegacenti	yes, I have not had the toture of installing on a laptop
2007-06-01T13:49:00.000Z	omegacenti	silent_	Many laptops are known to have weird support under linux installations. Especially this tablet pc
