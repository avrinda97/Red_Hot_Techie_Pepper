2007-04-23T13:45:00.000Z	crweb		I just want to make a not to all ubuntu.  This is the dumbest thing I have ever seen in an installer.
2007-04-23T13:47:00.000Z	Madpilot	crweb	if you've got no spare harddrive space, how do you intend to install anything, regardless of installer?
2007-04-23T13:47:00.000Z	crweb	Madpilot	unless ubuntu has grown past 12 gigs over night. shouldn't be a problem to install to /
2007-04-23T13:48:00.000Z	Madpilot	crweb	now I'm confused. If you know which partition you want to use, why not just point the installer in the right direction and go get a drink?
2007-04-23T13:48:00.000Z	crweb		I should beable to click a box that says "i dont' give a damn, install without formatting"
2007-04-23T13:49:00.000Z	crweb	Madpilot	because it wants to format the partition
2007-04-23T13:50:00.000Z	Madpilot	crweb	so the problem is? It needs to be empty to install into, yes?
2007-04-23T13:50:00.000Z	crweb	Madpilot	i moved evertyhing around and now it wants to format /,  when all there is on there is /backup
2007-04-23T13:50:00.000Z	crweb		no it doesn't
2007-04-23T13:50:00.000Z	crweb	Madpilot	you just dont' want old files to be in teh file system. Which they aren't, all there is, is /backup
2007-04-23T13:51:00.000Z	Madpilot	crweb	is /backup another partition, or just a set of files? If files, they're going to get nuked by the installer. If another partition, who cares?
2007-04-23T13:52:00.000Z	crweb	Madpilot	did you just jump in the middle?
2007-04-23T13:52:00.000Z	crweb	Madpilot	the problem is that EXACTLY.  I don't want to format the /.  I need to install over what is there
2007-04-23T13:52:00.000Z	Madpilot	crweb	I must have, because I feel like I'm missing something odd about your setup
2007-04-23T13:54:00.000Z	Madpilot	crweb	so, your / is already in use, and you're trying to convince the installer to somehow install around the stuff that's there?
2007-04-23T13:54:00.000Z	crweb	Madpilot	recap,  other partitions are full, I have 12 gigs free on a empty file system (except /backup)  there will be no conflicts with the inistaller. It _should_ beable to install without formating.  Every other distro will let you do this.  I'm trying to recover the system.
2007-04-23T13:55:00.000Z	crweb		what good is an installer if it can't do the most simple of recovery tasks.
2007-04-23T13:55:00.000Z	Madpilot	crweb	try the alternate CD installer, if you haven't already. It's the old-fashioned one, uglier but with a few features that haven't made it into the Desktop live installer so far.
