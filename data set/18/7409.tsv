2008-02-07T09:06:00.000Z	putnum		bio: i don't want vbox
2008-02-07T09:06:00.000Z	putnum		i prefer vmware
2008-02-07T09:06:00.000Z	putnum		well i mean not see the gui
2008-02-07T09:06:00.000Z	putnum		like have it run as a process
2008-02-07T09:07:00.000Z	putnum		i don't want to see the vmware window i guess is what i am trying to say
2008-02-07T09:09:00.000Z	putnum		ok and does anybody know if vbox works seamlessly like vmware does? And how many concurrent sessions does it allow ?
2008-02-07T09:09:00.000Z	putnum		i know vmware only allows 3
2008-02-07T09:10:00.000Z	putnum		vmware (from what i have read) only allows you to have 3 concurrent rdp sessions open at a time
2008-02-07T09:10:00.000Z	putnum		noogen: really?
2008-02-07T09:11:00.000Z	putnum		so you can open notepad,photoshop,itunes and ie all at the sametime?   and are you running them seamlessly or in the vm console
2008-02-07T09:11:00.000Z	Noogen	putnum	yep
2008-02-07T09:08:00.000Z	Noogen	putnum	if you start a virtual machine then it is run in the background until you stop it or shutdown
2008-02-07T09:08:00.000Z	Noogen	putnum	or you can set it up to start individual vm in the startup script
2008-02-07T09:09:00.000Z	Noogen	putnum	what do you mean 3?
2008-02-07T09:12:00.000Z	Noogen	putnum	i use seamless remote desktop desktop
2008-02-07T09:13:00.000Z	Noogen	putnum	it just work, though the session is your os limitation
2008-02-07T09:13:00.000Z	Noogen	putnum	there was an xp sp1 update that remove this limit in xp
2008-02-07T09:14:00.000Z	Noogen	putnum	why don't you have your start menu open?
