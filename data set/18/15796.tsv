2005-02-17T15:24:00.000Z	Ells		does anyone have any idea why I cannot hear sound while my dvd is playing
2005-02-17T15:25:00.000Z	Ells		gmplayer
2005-02-17T15:25:00.000Z	Ells		it wont play sound for that or xmms
2005-02-17T15:26:00.000Z	Ells		any idea to correct this
2005-02-17T15:26:00.000Z	anti_	Ells	mplayer has an option "-ao"
2005-02-17T15:26:00.000Z	anti_	Ells	you can get a list with "-ao help"
2005-02-17T15:26:00.000Z	anti_	Ells	try some
2005-02-17T15:27:00.000Z	anti_	Ells	yeah. that or you use "mplayer -ao <stuff>" from the commandline for testing.
2005-02-17T15:32:00.000Z	anti_	Ells	I guess you have a sound demon running. esd. perhaps.
2005-02-17T15:34:00.000Z	anti_	Ells	no, it is the mplayer switch...
2005-02-17T15:35:00.000Z	anti_	Ells	"mplayer -ao esd dvd://1" in a terminal.
2005-02-17T15:35:00.000Z	anti_	Ells	or gmplayer -> settings -> soundsomething -> [x]  esdblah -> restart gmplayer :-)
2005-02-17T15:37:00.000Z	anti_	Ells	gmplayer is just a graphical interface to mplayer.
2005-02-17T15:37:00.000Z	anti_	Ells	they are the same thing, really.
2005-02-17T15:39:00.000Z	anti_	Ells	I'd think mplayer finds it's codecs, even if upgraded.
2005-02-17T16:45:00.000Z	anti_	Ells	I have no more idea, sorry. I can't imagine why esd hangs...
2005-02-17T16:46:00.000Z	anti_	Ells	how did you install mplayer?
2005-02-17T16:48:00.000Z	anti_	Ells	"uninstalling hoary" is much more complicated than reinstalling warty from scratch. I don't think you want that :-)
