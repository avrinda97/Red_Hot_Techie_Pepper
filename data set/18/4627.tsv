2010-10-06T19:06:00.000Z	Submarine		so nobody knows how to force NetworkManager to use a specific 3G device, not just the first one it sees?
2010-10-06T19:07:00.000Z	acicula	Submarine	dont both devices show up in the list?
2010-10-06T19:08:00.000Z	Submarine	acicula	I don't see any list offering me a choice.
2010-10-06T19:09:00.000Z	Submarine	acicula	I looked at the logs from modem-manager and it tries to access the internal modem.
2010-10-06T19:09:00.000Z	acicula	Submarine	heu how do you connect the 3G, normally you plug in something 3g enabled, and the device shows up in the network applet etc
2010-10-06T19:09:00.000Z	Submarine	acicula	One device is internal, the other external.
2010-10-06T19:09:00.000Z	acicula	Submarine	yeah i figured
2010-10-06T19:10:00.000Z	acicula	Submarine	a quick workaround might be to disable the internal 3G modem in the bios or perhaps via kernel option, laptops usualyl allow for this.
2010-10-06T19:11:00.000Z	acicula	Submarine	anyway only the 3G internal modem shows as a broadband connection in the network applet?
2010-10-06T19:12:00.000Z	Submarine	acicula	The external modem shows, but logs show it tries to connect to the internal one.
2010-10-06T19:13:00.000Z	acicula	Submarine	the external modem shows up in networkmanager, but when selected modemmanager still defaults to the internal one?
2010-10-06T19:13:00.000Z	Submarine	acicula	Indeed.
2010-10-06T19:13:00.000Z	Submarine	acicula	I'm using modem-manager --debug and I see it trying to connect to /dev/ttyACM0, which is the internal one.
2010-10-06T19:13:00.000Z	Submarine	acicula	The external one is on /dev/ttyUSB0
2010-10-06T19:17:00.000Z	acicula	Submarine	hmm well a quick search on google isnt turning anything up. If you can id have a look to make sure the external 3G works by turning the internal one off. I dont know anything about debugging the network manager or how it connects to the modemmanger(dbus?)
2010-10-06T19:19:00.000Z	acicula	Submarine	i know the maintainer has multiple 3G devices to test with, so i doubt networkmanager doesnt understand how to deal with more then one 3G device so if i have to guess its somewhere in between where it goes wrong. Maybe its possible to set dbus into dbug mode to see the interaction between modemmanager and the Networkmanager
2010-10-06T19:20:00.000Z	Submarine	acicula	I'm filing a bug report.
2010-10-06T19:20:00.000Z	acicula	Submarine	yeah good idea
