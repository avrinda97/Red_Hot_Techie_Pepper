2012-10-10T10:04:00.000Z	crizis		because wubi = native install, only in windows filesystem
2012-10-10T10:04:00.000Z	crizis		it's not virtualized
2012-10-10T10:04:00.000Z	crizis		it's not, kinda, but it's not virtualized
2012-10-10T10:04:00.000Z	crizis		and yes, i wouldn't trust it, it breaks quite often
2012-10-10T10:05:00.000Z	crizis		and i really mean it *breaks* on updates
2012-10-10T10:05:00.000Z	crizis		and you can't fix it in any way anymore
2012-10-10T10:06:00.000Z	crizis		ok well, then it's pretty much best you'll get
2012-10-10T10:06:00.000Z	crizis		and yes, vbox is slow
2012-10-10T10:07:00.000Z	crizis		it doesn't have drivers 'for every type', but it does have drivers for ubuntu up to 12.04 currently
2012-10-10T10:07:00.000Z	crizis		and fedora and few other 'big' distros
2012-10-10T10:08:00.000Z	theadmin	crizis	Not exactly correct, it has generic Linux drivers (when you go to Devices -> Install guest additions), they do have requirements to kernel/X versions though
2012-10-10T10:09:00.000Z	crizis	theadmin	close enough :)
2012-10-10T10:14:00.000Z	crizis	theadmin	http://www.ubuntu.com/download/arm
2012-10-10T10:15:00.000Z	theadmin	crizis	Don't see anything about the Raspberry Pi there. Actually, I've seen on raspberrypi.org that they say that Ubuntu doesn't work with the pi
2012-10-10T10:15:00.000Z	crizis	theadmin	still, ubuntu does have ARM build :P
2012-10-10T10:21:00.000Z	theadmin	crizis	I know both Python and Ruby. Python makes more sense in many ways.
2012-10-10T10:21:00.000Z	crizis	theadmin	i know both too, and i think c makes more sense :P
2012-10-10T10:22:00.000Z	theadmin	crizis	Anyway we got offtopic, if you want to continue this you may PM me.
