2008-11-16T18:51:00.000Z	ay^	outbackwifi	and how do I find that out?
2008-11-16T18:52:00.000Z	outbackwifi	ay^	the few lines before panic should tell you
2008-11-16T18:52:00.000Z	ay^	outbackwifi	I'm not in a terminal system here, I get no lines, it just freezes over and numlock and capslock lights start flashing
2008-11-16T18:52:00.000Z	outbackwifi	ay^	how did you know that it was a kernel panic?
2008-11-16T18:53:00.000Z	ay^	outbackwifi	I've been told that kernel panics flash numlock and capslock.
2008-11-16T19:12:00.000Z	outbackwifi	ay^	does this happen even in recovery mode?
2008-11-16T19:13:00.000Z	ay^	outbackwifi	I haven't tried recovery mode actually.. I'll do that as well
