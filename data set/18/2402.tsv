2010-05-30T21:42:00.000Z	vic20gmr_[lucid]		what is the easiest way for me to make things so that my monitor refresh is 72hz instead of the default 60hz?
2010-05-30T21:42:00.000Z	vic20gmr_[lucid]		i have researched it, and im still not clear on wut to do
2010-05-30T21:43:00.000Z	vic20gmr_[lucid]		60hz causes me pain
2010-05-30T21:44:00.000Z	wise_crypt	vic20gmr_[lucid]	system > preference > monitor i assume you use gnome
2010-05-30T21:44:00.000Z	vic20gmr_[lucid]	wise_crypt	i use gnome, but i cant change it from monitor panel
2010-05-30T21:45:00.000Z	vic20gmr_[lucid]	wise_crypt	it only gives 60hz as a choice
2010-05-30T21:45:00.000Z	wise_crypt	vic20gmr_[lucid]	change the resolution
2010-05-30T21:46:00.000Z	vic20gmr_[lucid]	wise_crypt	so my choices are "seeing more stuff" or "72hz"?
2010-05-30T21:47:00.000Z	vic20gmr_[lucid]	wise_crypt	i tried 800x600, and i gained 56hz in addition to 60hz, at 640x480, i have only 60hz
2010-05-30T21:48:00.000Z	wise_crypt	vic20gmr_[lucid]	what vga card please ?
2010-05-30T21:49:00.000Z	vic20gmr_[lucid]	wise_crypt	radeon 9600
2010-05-30T21:50:00.000Z	wise_crypt	vic20gmr_[lucid]	i think you should install the driver first follow the link ubootu gave you to see how is the install process
2010-05-30T21:50:00.000Z	vic20gmr_[lucid]	wise_crypt	i dont think it is a gfx card drvr issue
2010-05-30T21:54:00.000Z	vic20gmr_[lucid]	wise_crypt	i was hoping for something that would allow me to alter the "modeline", not to sure about it all, id rather not have to edit files manually, if i can avoid it
2010-05-30T21:55:00.000Z	wise_crypt	vic20gmr_[lucid]	 :) nice conduct
2010-05-30T21:55:00.000Z	vic20gmr_[lucid]	wise_crypt	huh?
2010-05-30T21:56:00.000Z	wise_crypt	vic20gmr_[lucid]	 if you not sure its a good this to avoid "mode line"
2010-05-30T21:57:00.000Z	vic20gmr_[lucid]	wise_crypt	ya, y i was hoping to find something that might do it for me, along the lines of startup manager "editing" grub file[s] for me
