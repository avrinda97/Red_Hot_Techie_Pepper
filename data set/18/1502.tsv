2011-03-10T21:14:00.000Z	terry	greg3000	i.e. vncviewer 192.168.1.5:1
2011-03-10T21:06:00.000Z	terry	greg3000	What server are you using?
2011-03-10T21:06:00.000Z	greg3000	terry	I'm using TightVNC server
2011-03-10T21:08:00.000Z	terry	greg3000	If you used tightvnc to start the server, it should have told you where to connect.  Like ###.##.##.#:1 or something like that.  So use vncviewer ###.##.##.#:1
2011-03-10T21:09:00.000Z	greg3000	terry	yes I'm able to connect, just not interact
2011-03-10T21:09:00.000Z	terry	greg3000	What command did you use to try to connect?
2011-03-10T21:10:00.000Z	terry	greg3000	Show us the command you used to try and connect.
2011-03-10T21:11:00.000Z	greg3000	terry	vncviewer -q 0 -compresslevel 0 -bgr233 localhost:5901
2011-03-10T21:11:00.000Z	terry	greg3000	localhost?
2011-03-10T21:12:00.000Z	greg3000	terry	I'm using some port forwarding so it' acts like localhost
2011-03-10T21:12:00.000Z	terry	greg3000	well, I don't know  how you did that
2011-03-10T21:13:00.000Z	greg3000	terry	it's just a ssh tunnel, I use them all the time
2011-03-10T21:13:00.000Z	terry	greg3000	You don't have to specify the port number, just the vnc screen number, (which if it's the first or only one you've started, it will be 1)
2011-03-10T21:13:00.000Z	terry	greg3000	Just use the IP address.
2011-03-10T21:14:00.000Z	greg3000	terry	it's all the same in this situation
2011-03-10T21:16:00.000Z	terry	greg3000	you mean tightvnc, right?
2011-03-10T21:17:00.000Z	greg3000	terry	it really says  Xtightvnc
2011-03-10T21:17:00.000Z	terry	greg3000	Hummm ok...
