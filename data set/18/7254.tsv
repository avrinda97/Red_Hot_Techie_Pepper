2008-09-01T14:42:00.000Z	tony_		Hi, everyone. I have a Compaq Presario F500 model, and I can't get the wireless to work. It worked under Fiesty, but when I tried to reinstall Fiesty just to get it back, it was still dead. I reinstalled Hardy and messed with it for a long time, and now I'm out of ideas. Can anyone help?

2008-09-01T14:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tony_	start with lspci and websearch from there
2009-12-29T03:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tony_	does it show up as a partition in: sudo fdisk -l    ?
2011-08-22T00:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tony_	they run ubuntu well :)
2011-08-22T00:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tony_	i've seen them run it ok with a lot of tweaks, I'd use LUbuntu on it personally
2011-08-22T00:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tony_	that's more than all my systems combined
2011-08-22T00:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tony_	I haven't bought a new rig in years, all I do is web browse and chat so I don't need 8Gb ram with quad core cpu
2011-08-22T00:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tony_	uninstall old kernels can save tonnes of space
2011-08-22T00:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tony_	http://lubuntu.lafibre.info/11.04/
2011-08-22T00:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tony_	I'd go the main one, not used the low space one so couldn't comment. You could join #lubuntu and see what the difference is
2011-08-22T01:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tony_	looks funky. I see you made your OS look like Win7 etc
2011-08-22T01:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tony_	redhat is offtopic here
2012-02-18T03:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tony_	its dead handy for support :)
2012-02-18T03:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tony_	not if you install a different desktop
2012-02-18T05:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tony_	are the USB speakers set as the output devices? Personally I'd just avoid them
2012-02-18T05:36:00.000Z	tony_	ActionParsnip	Yes, they are so temperamental. If I restart, they sometimes work
2012-02-18T05:36:00.000Z	tony_	ActionParsnip	In fact, sometimes I can output sound and sometimes I can't
