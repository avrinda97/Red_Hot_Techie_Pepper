2009-03-09T11:08:00.000Z	likeafox		it works fine
2009-03-09T11:09:00.000Z	likeafox		on Ubuntu though you seem to be plagued with updates
2009-03-09T11:09:00.000Z	likeafox		on Debian it's easy to keep up to date
2009-03-09T11:10:00.000Z	likeafox		I seem to get updates every other day
2009-03-09T11:11:00.000Z	likeafox		on Debian stable though I hardly ever needed to update
2009-03-09T11:12:00.000Z	likeafox		Heh I don't mind that much, just trying to illustrate a difference
2009-03-09T11:14:00.000Z	likeafox		I came here because I want to know how do I do administrator things that don't prompt for a password?  I just get an error saying I don't have permission :S
2009-03-09T11:15:00.000Z	likeafox		from nautilus though
2009-03-09T11:15:00.000Z	likeafox		is that what the file browser is called?
2009-03-09T11:16:00.000Z	likeafox		I want to use a file browser to work with files I need permission for
2009-03-09T11:16:00.000Z	quibbler	likeafox	you can run root nautilus from a terminal with  gksudo nautilus
2009-03-09T11:17:00.000Z	likeafox		Okay I'll try that
2009-03-09T11:17:00.000Z	quibbler	likeafox	be careful!
2009-03-09T11:17:00.000Z	likeafox		Thanks for the warning
2009-03-09T11:17:00.000Z	likeafox		Oh also is there a shortcut to get a terminal?
2009-03-09T11:18:00.000Z	likeafox	myron	shorter!
2009-03-09T11:20:00.000Z	quibbler	likeafox	in configuration editor go to /apps/metacity/global_keybindings/run_command_terminal and give it a key
2009-03-09T11:21:00.000Z	quibbler	likeafox	 you can start the editor with  gconf-editor
