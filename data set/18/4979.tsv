2010-11-12T15:35:00.000Z	ozram		anyone in here experienced with jackd, qsynth and playing with a midi keyboard in standalone? i could really use some help here. this keyboard is driving me nuts....
2010-11-12T15:35:00.000Z	sacarlson	ozram	I used to get jackd to work but only as sudo to start
2010-11-12T15:37:00.000Z	sacarlson	ozram	been a while but i ran something like patch
2010-11-12T15:37:00.000Z	sacarlson	ozram	what is standalone?
2010-11-12T15:38:00.000Z	sacarlson	ozram	I used the keyboard software that interfaces the leter keys to the midi events to test it
2010-11-12T15:39:00.000Z	sacarlson	ozram	I used the tmidity
2010-11-12T15:40:00.000Z	sacarlson	ozram	and virtual midi keyboard
2010-11-12T15:41:00.000Z	sacarlson	ozram	opps and that was timidity
2010-11-12T15:42:00.000Z	sacarlson	ozram	I don't have a midi keyboard just the keyboard on my computer
2010-11-12T15:42:00.000Z	sacarlson	ozram	I used it to test the sounds of drum synths and stuf
2010-11-12T15:45:00.000Z	sacarlson	ozram	I think timidity starts at boot but can start it from the terminal
2010-11-12T15:45:00.000Z	sacarlson	ozram	yes timidity converts midi files to sound
2010-11-12T15:46:00.000Z	sacarlson	ozram	no jackd is more like a sound mixer
2010-11-12T15:46:00.000Z	sacarlson	ozram	 timidity simulates a synthisizer with midi events it creates sounds
2010-11-12T15:47:00.000Z	sacarlson	ozram	you can use your keyboard to create the events to play it
2010-11-12T15:48:00.000Z	sacarlson	ozram	 the patch panel will be the gui part to route your midi events to the instruments you want to play
2010-11-12T15:48:00.000Z	sacarlson	ozram	best take this offline this is not ubuntu related
2010-11-12T15:49:00.000Z	sacarlson	ozram	you can pm me
