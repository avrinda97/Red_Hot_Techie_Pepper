2006-05-27T07:10:00.000Z	zizie	alfredn	: i cant setup it lolz cause im newbie ... is that ok if i use webmin ?
2006-05-27T07:10:00.000Z	alfredn	zizie	that is how I started, sometimes I would use it and then look at the files it changed
2006-05-27T07:11:00.000Z	zizie	alfredn	: is that enough install webmin ... cause i need apache and mysql either...
2006-05-27T07:11:00.000Z	alfredn	zizie	just go to the website, download, untar ie tar xzvf and in it's folder will be a setup file just go sh setup and it will walk you through it
2006-05-27T07:11:00.000Z	zizie	alfredn	: is that enough install webmin ... cause i need apache and mysql either... or maybe i need install apache first ?
2006-05-27T07:11:00.000Z	alfredn	zizie	yes webmin is it's own server no apache needed no mysql
2006-05-27T07:11:00.000Z	zizie	alfredn	: can i use apt-get install webmin ?
