2009-12-10T18:05:00.000Z	Ultali		on Jaunty I am having trouble with mouse devices, clicks are recognised but moving the cursor just isn't happening, not sure what changed to cause the problem. Tried all my backed up xorg confs none of them help, dmesg shows the logitech mouse on USB (and clicks work) hald is running. Anyone got some ideas for trouble shooting?
2009-12-10T18:07:00.000Z	epinky	Ultali	sudo service dbus restart && sudo service gdm restart

2009-12-10T18:13:00.000Z	epinky	Ultali	do a ctrl-alt-del to get to a prompt, then quickly type init 3 to prevent reboot
