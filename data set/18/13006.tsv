2006-01-26T10:15:00.000Z	APT-GET_INSTALL_	stunna	heh, I have very good words of advice that i want you to learn, write down, memorize. one is 'apt-cache search foo' the other is 'apt-get install foo' foo being the package name
2006-01-26T10:15:00.000Z	APT-GET_INSTALL_	stunna	it is also very important to learn apt-get update, as to refresh your cached headers list, so you're apt-cache and apt-get install programs have the current versions
