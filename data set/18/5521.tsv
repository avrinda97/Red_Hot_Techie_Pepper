2008-10-09T16:12:00.000Z	denialh		rightclick the network name and click close
2008-10-09T16:12:00.000Z	denialh		or Server -> Disconnect
2008-10-09T16:13:00.000Z	ne2k__	denialh	why on earth does that say to right click on the name of the channel?! this kind of assumes rather a lot about the irc client, no?
2008-10-09T16:13:00.000Z	denialh	ne2k__	what are you talking about?
2008-10-09T16:13:00.000Z	ne2k__	denialh	the #ubuntu-it blurb
2008-10-09T16:14:00.000Z	denialh		oh right, i dunno
2008-10-09T16:14:00.000Z	denialh		maybe it should be changed to type /join
2008-10-09T16:15:00.000Z	ne2k__	denialh	maybe it should just not say anything about how to use your irc client, like all the other language ones
2008-10-09T16:15:00.000Z	ne2k__		!fr
2008-10-09T16:15:00.000Z	ne2k__		!de
2008-10-09T16:15:00.000Z	ne2k__		!se
2008-10-09T16:15:00.000Z	ne2k__		!fi
2008-10-09T16:15:00.000Z	denialh		these are better
2008-10-09T16:15:00.000Z	ne2k__	denialh	they don't say anything about how to use your irc client!
2008-10-09T16:16:00.000Z	denialh		yep
2008-10-09T16:16:00.000Z	ne2k__	denialh	they just say to join the channel. if you're in #ubuntu you presumably worked out how to join a channel
2008-10-09T16:16:00.000Z	denialh		well, most people that use non-gui irc clients are intelligent enough to figure they can't rightclick ;-)
2008-10-09T16:16:00.000Z	ne2k__	denialh	still, it's pointless
