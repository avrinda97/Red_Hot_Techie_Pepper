2009-07-28T11:54:00.000Z	TannerS		Guys I have windows vista and windows 7 installed in my system, but grub bootloader only sees the vista one, what cna i do?
2009-07-28T11:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TannerS	you will need to add an entry in /boot/grub/menu.lst to boot the other OS
2009-07-28T11:55:00.000Z	TannerS	ActionParsnip	im alreayd viewing the file, just dont know which..... well my vista entry has this in it (hd0,0) idk what my win 7 is, maybe (hd0,10?
2009-07-28T11:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TannerS	the entry that boots the vista is pretty much what you need but the partition used will be different
2009-07-28T11:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TannerS	if you only have 1 disk, the first number will always be 0
2009-07-28T11:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TannerS	if you read the output of: sudo fdisk -l  you will see what partition number (you will need to subtract 1 as grub numbers start at 0 and linux start numbers at 1)
2009-07-28T11:57:00.000Z	TannerS	ActionParsnip	, ok let me see
2009-07-28T11:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TannerS	make an extra entry and you can try it, if it boots, great, if not, boot to Ubuntu and re-edit
2009-07-28T11:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TannerS	yep
2009-07-28T11:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TannerS	assuming sda is the first disk according to grub
2009-07-28T11:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TannerS	if you only have a single disk, the answer is definately yes
2009-07-28T11:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TannerS	don't worry if its wrong it wont break anything, just that entry won't boot anything
2009-07-28T12:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TannerS	why do you need vista and 7 installed?
2009-07-28T12:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TannerS	gksudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst
2009-07-28T12:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TannerS	or sudo nano /boot/grub/menu.lst   if you prefer nano, etc
2009-07-28T12:06:00.000Z	TannerS	ActionParsnip	, no luck =/
2009-07-28T12:38:00.000Z	TannerS	ActionParsnip	i have such a wierd error
2009-07-28T12:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TannerS	ask the channel
