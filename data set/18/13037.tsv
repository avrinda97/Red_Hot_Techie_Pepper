2006-08-11T05:56:00.000Z	torpedo|dog		Can anybody help me diagnose a different Xorg problem? I'm trying to get fglrx to work and...it's not. http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/20226
2006-08-11T05:57:00.000Z	sethk	torpedo|dog	we need the X log file, not the xorg.conf (or at least in addition to the xorg.conf)
2006-08-11T05:57:00.000Z	torpedo|dog	sethk	okay, one moment
2006-08-11T06:02:00.000Z	torpedo|dog	sethk	http://pastebin.ca/125867
2006-08-11T06:04:00.000Z	sethk	torpedo|dog	remind me, what is your problem again?  I know I asked you to paste your log file, but I don't remember what we were talking about  :)
2006-08-11T06:04:00.000Z	torpedo|dog	sethk	trying to get fglrx to work ;)
2006-08-11T06:05:00.000Z	sethk	torpedo|dog	according to the log, fglrx is working
2006-08-11T06:05:00.000Z	sethk	torpedo|dog	I would tell it to not use the frame buffer
2006-08-11T06:06:00.000Z	torpedo|dog	sethk	doesn't seem like it: fglrxinfo reports "OpenGL vendor string: Mesa project: www.mesa3d.org"
2006-08-11T06:06:00.000Z	sethk	torpedo|dog	that's not an error
2006-08-11T06:07:00.000Z	torpedo|dog	sethk	where do I tell it not to use the framebuffer?
2006-08-11T06:08:00.000Z	sethk	torpedo|dog	I do it with dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2006-08-11T06:08:00.000Z	torpedo|dog	sethk	okay, thanks
2006-08-11T06:30:00.000Z	torpedo|dog	sethk	just leave it the way dpkg already has it?
2006-08-11T06:30:00.000Z	sethk	torpedo|dog	as long as it correctly identified your monitor
2006-08-11T06:31:00.000Z	torpedo|dog	sethk	goodo
2006-08-11T06:34:00.000Z	torpedo|dog	sethk	one last xorg.conf thing: if dpkg added a bunch of Tablet PC-only stuff to my xorg.conf, can I safely comment it out? I don't have a tablet ;)
2006-08-31T06:30:00.000Z	sethk	torpedo|dog	wrong how?
