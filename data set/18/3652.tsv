2009-09-19T22:25:00.000Z	aj_444		I just ran an update using the terminal, did the restart, and when it rebooted it got stuck on the screen with the progress bar and ubuntu logo. I've manually turned it off and retried it several times but I get nothing. Does anybody know whot to fix this?
2009-09-19T22:25:00.000Z	aj_444		how not whot*
2009-09-19T22:25:00.000Z	sageb1	aj_444	you upgraded to 8.10 or higher? from below that?
2009-09-19T22:26:00.000Z	aj_444	sageb1	its the intel gma 950.
2009-09-19T22:26:00.000Z	sageb1	aj_444	ubuntu runs that graphic stuff on top of X, compiz or somewhat
2009-09-19T22:27:00.000Z	aj_444	sageb1	When I was updating, I accidentally closed my laptop, and the internet stopped.
2009-09-19T22:27:00.000Z	sageb1	aj_444	ok so reinstall again
2009-09-19T22:28:00.000Z	aj_444	sageb1	I need to totally reinstall ubuntu?
2009-09-19T22:28:00.000Z	sageb1	aj_444	absolutely not
2009-09-19T22:29:00.000Z	aj_444	sageb1	I was just doing a partial update. I wasn't switching versions.
2009-09-19T22:29:00.000Z	sageb1	aj_444	ok, do u use compiz religiously?
2009-09-19T22:29:00.000Z	aj_444	sageb1	I don't really know what compiz is. So.. I doubt it.
2009-09-19T22:30:00.000Z	sageb1	aj_444	since you didn't know Ubuntu probably is but didn't tell you
2009-09-19T22:31:00.000Z	sageb1	aj_444	hm i forgot how to turn off compiz without using the gui
2009-09-19T22:32:00.000Z	aj_444	sageb1	the problem is, I can't boot up my system.
2009-09-19T22:33:00.000Z	sageb1	aj_444	can you boot into single user mode from start up? or does it get that far after POST?
2009-09-19T22:33:00.000Z	aj_444	sageb1	I can get to the GRUB Screen, then I can select the usual four options, but after that, nothing boots.
2009-09-19T22:37:00.000Z	aj_444	sageb1	Mmk. A clean install will probably fix the problem. I appreciate the help though. :)
