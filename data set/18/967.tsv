2012-10-31T12:03:00.000Z	cristian_c		Hi
2012-10-31T12:04:00.000Z	cristian_c		I've found that I can send commands to my irc client from a configuration file: perform.conf
2012-10-31T12:04:00.000Z	cristian_c		for example: cmd = /join #ubuntu
2012-10-31T12:04:00.000Z	cristian_c		If I add this line to a particular server section, the command is executed
2012-10-31T12:05:00.000Z	cristian_c		I could launch a script in the same manner: cmd = /exec -o ~/scriptname
2012-10-31T12:05:00.000Z	cristian_c		I'd like to use this tecnique for use a personal quit message in irc
2012-10-31T12:05:00.000Z	cristian_c		How can I do to get this?
2012-10-31T12:06:00.000Z	somsip	cristian_c	you really need support for your IRC client. This is ubuntu support
2012-10-31T12:06:00.000Z	cristian_c	somsip	my client is into the official ubuntu repo
2012-10-31T12:07:00.000Z	somsip	cristian_c	which client do you use?
2012-10-31T12:07:00.000Z	cristian_c	somsip	lostirc
2012-10-31T12:09:00.000Z	somsip	cristian_c	join #lostirc to get support from people who use this
2012-10-31T12:09:00.000Z	cristian_c	somsip	lostirc is an empty channel
2012-10-31T12:17:00.000Z	somsip	cristian_c	with common applications, you may well get help in here. With little known applications, you may not. That's why you've been redirected to the support channel for that specfic app
2012-10-31T12:18:00.000Z	cristian_c	somsip	where is the blacklisted application for the support channel? :)
2012-10-31T12:19:00.000Z	cristian_c	somsip	I've done that, but it's an empty channel
2012-10-31T12:19:00.000Z	somsip	cristian_c	you ask, and if people are unable to help you, you come back another time. End of conversation
2012-10-31T12:20:00.000Z	cristian_c	somsip	I do always this :)
