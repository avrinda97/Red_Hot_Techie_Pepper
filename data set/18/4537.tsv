2009-07-20T23:30:00.000Z	^cheeky		hi, if i am in my server via sftp, and iam in the directory where i want to drop some files from my main machine .. what command would i use .. i mean it  would "put"but how do i give the path way of my desktop machine  to my server
2009-07-20T23:30:00.000Z	grawity	^cheeky	'lcd' will change directories in the local machine.
2009-07-20T23:31:00.000Z	grawity	^cheeky	You might want to try the integrated SFTP support in GNOME -- just click Places -> Connectg to server...
2009-07-20T23:32:00.000Z	^cheeky	grawity	umm sorry stupid question, i take it then it would be ssh i choose then or ftp ?
2009-07-20T23:33:00.000Z	grawity	^cheeky	SSH.
2009-07-20T23:33:00.000Z	^cheeky	grawity	i already am sshd into my server, via terminal
2009-07-20T23:35:00.000Z	grawity	^cheeky	The "SSH" option in GNOME actually opens a SFTP connection for file transfers. Except you'll be able to simply drag and drop the files.
2009-07-20T23:35:00.000Z	^cheeky	grawity	oh nice .. it opens up a browser with sftp buut, when i move a file from desktop to the remote folder it says .. access denied ?
2009-07-20T23:36:00.000Z	^cheeky	grawity	yeah .. i did this but get permission denied
2009-07-20T23:36:00.000Z	grawity	^cheeky	Did you browse to your home directory? By default, GNOME throws you directly into the root directory of the remote server - usually you need to go to the "home" folder and then open your owndirectory there.
2009-07-20T23:36:00.000Z	grawity	^cheeky	your own*
2009-07-20T23:37:00.000Z	^cheeky	grawity	oh man i made the folder i want to share in my root folder .. is that a bad thing ?
2009-07-20T23:38:00.000Z	grawity	^cheeky	It isn't a bad thing, but the directory might not have the required permissions, depending on how you made it.
2009-07-20T23:39:00.000Z	grawity	^cheeky	You might need to set yourself as that directory's owner -- in the SSH session, 'sudo chown yourusername /directory/'
2009-07-20T23:39:00.000Z	^cheeky	grawity	how can i give it permission for it .. chown -R cheeky /cheekymedia ..?
2009-07-20T23:39:00.000Z	grawity	^cheeky	Yes.
2009-07-20T23:39:00.000Z	^cheeky	grawity	let me try
2009-07-22T14:41:00.000Z	grawity	^cheeky	Also, the shortcuts Alt+1, Alt+2...Alt+0, Alt+Q, Alt+W... switch windows up to 20th
