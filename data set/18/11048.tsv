2006-11-21T13:16:00.000Z	sky123	ArrenLex	that was nice work...i learned a lot.
2006-11-21T13:18:00.000Z	sky123	ArrenLex	so he's doing this in rescue right?
2006-11-21T13:18:00.000Z	ArrenLex	sky123	yes; booted from a livecd
2006-11-21T13:20:00.000Z	ArrenLex	sky123	he will have to install the bootloader... now that he changed the root filesystems, he will need to sudo update-grub to rebuild the automagic kernel list, and then sudo grub-install /dev/sda to write it into the master boot block of the first drive.
2006-11-21T13:21:00.000Z	sky123	ArrenLex	very similar steps on centos as well.. which i had to do about 4 months ago
2006-11-21T13:21:00.000Z	ArrenLex	sky123	yeah... Linux is Linux is Linux.
2006-11-21T13:21:00.000Z	ArrenLex	sky123	I had to go through it all a couple days ago, so I'm fresh... finally dumped ubuntu and went back to debian.

2006-11-21T13:22:00.000Z	sky123	ArrenLex	well i suppose it is a natural progression of sorts..
2006-11-21T13:22:00.000Z	ArrenLex	sky123	no; I started out on Debian. =P
2006-11-21T13:25:00.000Z	sky123	ArrenLex	it would be nice to see a contrib of sorts in the wiki...
