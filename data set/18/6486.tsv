2008-10-31T01:50:00.000Z	kane77		is there anything I should do to run windows programs on amd64 ubuntu?
2008-10-31T01:50:00.000Z	joaopinto	kane77	you can use wine for some of them
2008-10-31T01:51:00.000Z	kane77	joaopinto	yes, but a program is runing flawlessly on 32 bit ubuntu but does not even start for amd64 one..
2008-10-31T01:51:00.000Z	joaopinto	kane77	that's odd
2009-04-30T00:55:00.000Z	joaopinto	kane77	if you had a sucessfull running system with 8.04, and now it's freezing with the same version, you are more likely to have an hw issue, did you run the memtesT ?
2009-04-30T00:56:00.000Z	kane77	joaopinto	tried leaving running the memtest for quite some time but it did not find any problem
2009-04-30T00:59:00.000Z	joaopinto	kane77	boot the live disk, check the disk name, with : sudo fdis -l, and then check for bad blocks with: sudo badblocks drive
2009-04-30T01:00:00.000Z	kane77	joaopinto	I'll try that and let you know how it goes
2009-04-30T01:00:00.000Z	kane77	joaopinto	I would really like to have ubuntu back on this machine - it's dad's computer and he got quite used to it :)
2009-04-30T01:05:00.000Z	kane77	joaopinto	should badblocks have some output?
2009-04-30T01:07:00.000Z	kane77	joaopinto	?
2009-04-30T01:08:00.000Z	kane77	joaopinto	done running badblocks on all my ubuntu partitions (/ /home swap).. is there anything else I should try to run?
2009-04-30T01:09:00.000Z	joaopinto	kane77	I have no idea on your problem :\
2009-07-05T14:30:00.000Z	joaopinto	kane77	there are several utilites to find dup files in general
2009-07-05T14:30:00.000Z	joaopinto	kane77	to find duplicated files you can use fdupes
2009-07-05T14:31:00.000Z	kane77	joaopinto	but I was thinking something oriented on music, since you can have multiple files of the same song that are in different bitrate (thus different files) but they are the same song..
2009-07-05T14:34:00.000Z	joaopinto	kane77	try http://linux.softpedia.com/get/Multimedia/Audio/Duplicate-Music-Matcher-4889.shtml
2009-07-05T14:34:00.000Z	kane77	joaopinto	thanks
