2006-12-17T12:50:00.000Z	amro		I'm getting an error when logging into GNOME on Edgy: something about a message bus error
2006-12-17T12:52:00.000Z	amro		anyone know what could be causing a message bus error when logging into GNOME on edgy?
2006-12-17T12:53:00.000Z	PriceChild	amro	what error?
2006-12-17T12:54:00.000Z	amro	PriceChild	im attempting to make it show up, sometimes i see a gray box instead of the error box, but i remember something about failing to map a message bus address
2006-12-17T12:55:00.000Z	PriceChild	amro	I've not got a clue what's going on :) - probs won't know the answer either. Would be best to know what you're doing
2006-12-17T12:59:00.000Z	amro	PriceChild	I've just installed Ubuntu Edgy on another laptop. It ran fine with LiveCD, but when I login through the installed one all I see is the background image. When logging in Failsafe Gnome, I get a gray box which sometimes fully renders with the error message
2006-12-17T13:00:00.000Z	PriceChild	amro	what error?
2006-12-17T13:02:00.000Z	amro	PriceChild	It logged into GNOME and I can see the panels now, and I got the error, which says that themes/sounds/etc might not work properly (and they don't) because it could not find the address of the message bus
2006-12-17T13:06:00.000Z	amro	PriceChild	That's what was generating the error. It outputs some dbus related errors and crashes
2006-12-17T13:09:00.000Z	amro	PriceChild	any other ideas?
2006-12-17T13:09:00.000Z	PriceChild	amro	not sure why the daemon won't start :(
2006-12-17T13:13:00.000Z	amro	PriceChild	Well do you think I should reinstall?
2006-12-17T13:13:00.000Z	PriceChild	amro	no
2006-12-17T13:14:00.000Z	PriceChild	amro	i just don't know really
2006-12-17T13:25:00.000Z	amro	PriceChild	Reinstalling the dbus package fixed it. I suspect a bad CD
2006-12-17T13:26:00.000Z	PriceChild	amro	well done :)
2006-12-17T13:26:00.000Z	PriceChild	amro	sorry i couldn't help :)
2006-12-17T13:36:00.000Z	amro	PriceChild	Thanks a lot for helping!
