2009-02-08T06:36:00.000Z	jrib	Brando753	are you kidding?
2009-02-08T06:36:00.000Z	jrib	Brando753	everywhere you see FILE, write the name of your file instead
2009-09-23T05:42:00.000Z	jrib	Brando753	you can use gpg on ubuntu
2009-09-23T05:49:00.000Z	Brando753	jrib	I download an attached signature how do i verify it in ubuntu? how about Windows?
2009-09-23T05:50:00.000Z	jrib	Brando753	use gpg in ubuntu, no clue about windows
2009-09-23T05:51:00.000Z	jrib	Brando753	what is "it"?

2009-09-23T06:03:00.000Z	Brando753	jrib	so how will i verify the signatures then?
2009-09-23T06:06:00.000Z	jrib	Brando753	if you are using evolution, then it should do the verification on its own... As I said, I only know how to work with gpg directly, not with the gui you are using
2009-09-23T06:07:00.000Z	Brando753	jrib	I want to learn how to do it from gpg
