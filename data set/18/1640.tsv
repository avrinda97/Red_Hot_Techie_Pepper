2011-01-28T13:02:00.000Z	superxgl		i got into a problem, when i type " service network restart', it gives me the message :eth0 has different MAC address than expected, ignoring
2011-01-28T13:02:00.000Z	superxgl		could any one help me with this ?
2011-01-28T13:03:00.000Z	soreau	superxgl	Have you recently switched network hardware?
2011-01-28T13:04:00.000Z	superxgl	soreau	no, i have not
2011-01-28T13:04:00.000Z	soreau	superxgl	Is it causing a problem for you?
2011-01-28T13:05:00.000Z	superxgl	soreau	:　　yes, the eth0 can not active,
2011-01-28T13:05:00.000Z	soreau	superxgl	What card is it as reported by lspci?
2011-01-28T13:06:00.000Z	superxgl	soreau	: NetXtreme BCM5772
2011-01-28T13:08:00.000Z	soreau	superxgl	That is the full lspci output line?
2011-01-28T13:09:00.000Z	superxgl	soreau	no , wait a sec
2011-01-28T13:12:00.000Z	superxgl	soreau	: Ethernet Controller:  Broadcom Corporation NetXtreme BCM5722 Gigabit Ethernet PCI Express
2011-01-28T13:18:00.000Z	superxgl	soreau	: do u think there is some problem with my kernel?
2011-01-28T13:18:00.000Z	soreau	superxgl	I don't know, is there? :)
2011-01-28T13:19:00.000Z	soreau	superxgl	The only thing I see from googling is that broadcom has released the hardware specifications for this chip so there should be an open driver in the works somewhere I imagine
2011-01-28T13:20:00.000Z	superxgl	soreau	: so u mean i should download a driver and install for it ?
2011-01-28T13:21:00.000Z	soreau	superxgl	Well I didn't find any driver yet
2011-01-28T13:23:00.000Z	superxgl	soreau	: i think maybe the kernel did not load the module for it
