2007-06-27T16:24:00.000Z	defrysk	Dabian	you must have used a not ubuntu repository
2007-06-27T16:24:00.000Z	Dabian	defrysk	How do I know?  There must be a way to find out which repository my software comes from.
2007-06-27T16:24:00.000Z	defrysk	Dabian	did you use automatix or something ?
2007-06-27T16:26:00.000Z	Dabian	defrysk	Nah .. I never used automatix or linuxconfig.  Well, maybe I tried linuxconfig once upon a time, I dont recall.
