2009-05-02T06:33:00.000Z	Linuz2009		I need help installing clamav
2009-05-02T06:34:00.000Z	muelli	Linuz2009	what's your question?
2009-05-02T06:35:00.000Z	muelli	Linuz2009	we know that already. So please stop telling us. Instead, please elaborate on yuor problem. We don't have any magic crystal balls to see magically see your problem
2009-05-02T06:52:00.000Z	muelli	Linuz2009	I guess it's "sudo apt-get install clamav"
2009-05-02T06:55:00.000Z	muelli	Linuz2009	you can list the contents of the "clamav" package if you do a "dpkg --listfiles clamav", IIRC. If it doesn't work, check the manpage for dpkg.
2009-05-02T06:56:00.000Z	Linuz2009	muelli	then what next
2009-05-02T06:56:00.000Z	muelli	Linuz2009	well. I can't know what you want to do, so I have no clue what you shuold do next...
2009-05-02T06:57:00.000Z	Linuz2009	muelli	I want to access clamav, I can't see it in my computer
2009-05-02T06:58:00.000Z	muelli	Linuz2009	Well. You know what files the package installed, right? Files installed under /bin/ or /usr/bin/ are executables you might want to run. Most likely /usr/bin/clamav. You probably just have to call it,.
2009-05-02T07:01:00.000Z	Linuz2009	muelli	how can i call it?
2009-05-02T07:02:00.000Z	muelli	Linuz2009	open your favourite terminal emulation, like gnome-terminal, and enter "clamav".
2009-05-02T07:04:00.000Z	Linuz2009	muelli	okay, I clicked clamav at my terminal and the update manager popped up.
2009-05-02T07:04:00.000Z	Linuz2009	muelli	is this suppose to happen?
2009-05-02T07:04:00.000Z	muelli	Linuz2009	what?
2009-05-02T07:05:00.000Z	Linuz2009	muelli	a update manager popped up when I enter clamav in the terminal.
2009-05-02T07:05:00.000Z	muelli	Linuz2009	I have no idea. I don't know clamav. But I highly suspect that it's fires up a GUI.
2009-05-02T07:06:00.000Z	Linuz2009	muelli	thanks by the way.
2009-05-02T07:09:00.000Z	muelli	Linuz2009	apt-get remove.
