2007-02-25T06:23:00.000Z	nekr0z		Hi all! Can anybody help me find a compose sequence for "LATIN SMALL LETTER G WITH CIRCUMFLEX"?
2007-02-25T06:24:00.000Z	vox754	nekr0z	just curious, which language?
2007-02-25T06:24:00.000Z	nekr0z	vox754	Esperanto
2007-07-20T13:25:00.000Z	vox754	nekr0z	did in work in the previous version?
2007-07-20T13:25:00.000Z	nekr0z	vox754	yes, perfectly
2007-07-20T13:26:00.000Z	vox754	nekr0z	I can't help you. But I wanted to say that it worked for me in 6.06 and then in 6.10, 7.04 it works no more. So I'll just leave without it.
2007-07-20T13:26:00.000Z	nekr0z	vox754	well I cannot. It's a laptop, and I need a sleep mode badly
2007-07-20T13:28:00.000Z	vox754	nekr0z	check out the forums if you haven't done already. Look for your specific model.
2007-07-20T13:28:00.000Z	nekr0z	vox754	I tried. It seems like people have terrible problems with hibernate and sleep on 7.04, but the symptoms are not the same
2007-07-20T13:30:00.000Z	vox754	nekr0z	actually I've been thinking on going back to 6.06. And you should think if you really need the new things 7.04 has to offer with respect to 6.10, maybe you could go  back too.
2007-07-20T13:30:00.000Z	nekr0z	vox754	too much trouble to downgrade
2007-07-20T13:31:00.000Z	vox754	nekr0z	your symptoms are exactly the same as mine. The screen goes off, but it doesn't really sleep. It just hangs.
2007-07-20T13:32:00.000Z	nekr0z	vox754	I'm thinking of upgrading to 7.10 tribe 3...
2007-07-20T13:33:00.000Z	nekr0z	vox754	but I'm kinda scared a little
2007-07-20T13:34:00.000Z	vox754	nekr0z	these things depend on kernel modules that control the power saving features, like acpi, so instead of downgrading or upgrading you need to identify the specific problem, that is, the specific version of the module that gave problems.
2007-07-20T13:35:00.000Z	nekr0z	vox754	I know that. But I'm not that mastered in kernel modules :(
2007-07-20T13:35:00.000Z	vox754	nekr0z	you may as well get the version from 6.10 and recompile it for your current 7.04 then talk to the developers to see what went wrong. I would say, yes, it hard to debug.
2007-07-20T13:36:00.000Z	nekr0z	vox754	thanks anyway... i'll try something
