2006-08-31T09:01:00.000Z	david__		Hello!  I installed a broken package (a Brother printer driver) and now apt is broken.  It keeps saying I need to reinstall the package, but the installation from the .deb always fails.  How do I tell it to remove what it can and ignore the rest?
2006-08-31T09:03:00.000Z	david__		This is the error synaptic gives: E: The package mfc4800lpr needs to be reinstalled, but I can't find an archive for it.
2006-08-31T09:03:00.000Z	david__		E: Internal error opening cache (1). Please report.
2006-08-31T09:04:00.000Z	david__		Also, I tried purging the package with dpkg and with apt-get, as well as force-all, remove, and --ignore-missing.  Nothing helps
2006-08-31T09:06:00.000Z	longwave	david__	where did that package initially come from? it's not in the default repos
2006-08-31T09:07:00.000Z	david__	longwave	brother's printer drivers for linux website.  I was trying to install a driver for my printer.  It came in a debian package.  Would you like the URL of the site it is from?
2006-08-31T09:08:00.000Z	longwave	david__	have you tried downloading the .deb again and installing it with dpkg -i file.deb ?
2006-08-31T09:08:00.000Z	david__	longwave	I have
2006-08-31T09:08:00.000Z	david__	longwave	3 times
2006-08-31T09:08:00.000Z	longwave	david__	and apt still complains with that error about the cache?
2006-08-31T09:09:00.000Z	david__	longwave	the .deb itself is broken.  The server's copy alway fails
2006-08-31T09:12:00.000Z	longwave	david__	a thread on the ubuntu forums suggests "sudo dpkg --remove --force-depends --force-remove-reinstreq mfc4800lpr" *might* fix the cache error
2006-08-31T09:12:00.000Z	david__	longwave	that didn't work (just tried it)
2006-08-31T09:13:00.000Z	david__	longwave	this is the error given to me by dpkg: /var/lib/dpkg/info/mfc4800lpr.postrm: line 3: /etc/init.d/lpd: No such file or directory

2006-08-31T09:16:00.000Z	david__	longwave	I'll try that all now
2006-08-31T09:38:00.000Z	david__	longwave	thank you so much!!! That post fixed my problems!
2006-08-31T09:38:00.000Z	david__	longwave	although it took me a while--I had installed several similar drivers, trying to get it to work
