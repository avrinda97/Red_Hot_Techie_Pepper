2008-01-14T01:07:00.000Z	MenZa	Darkmystere_	well, poke me if you need help
2008-01-14T01:07:00.000Z	MenZa	Darkmystere_	sudo aptitude install build-essential ; make clean ; make
2008-01-14T01:12:00.000Z	MenZa	Darkmystere_	That I can't help you with.
2008-01-14T01:13:00.000Z	MenZa	Darkmystere_	er.
2008-01-14T01:17:00.000Z	MenZa	Darkmystere_	no idea.
2008-01-14T01:18:00.000Z	MenZa	Darkmystere_	good luck.
2008-01-14T01:22:00.000Z	MenZa	Darkmystere_	no
2008-01-14T01:23:00.000Z	MenZa	Darkmystere_	you're in the root folder of the madwifi folder, right?
2008-01-14T01:25:00.000Z	MenZa	Darkmystere_	not a clue.
2008-01-14T01:27:00.000Z	MenZa	Darkmystere_	You could ask in #ubuntu-ops to have your ignore removed, if you behave nicely.
2008-01-14T01:29:00.000Z	MenZa	Darkmystere_	hmm, that sounds pretty odd, try asking in #madwifi
2008-01-14T01:30:00.000Z	Darkmystere_	MenZa	They never answer me... I wait for like 4hours not 1 person replies to me
2008-01-14T01:30:00.000Z	MenZa	Darkmystere_	It has something to do with setting the kernel path variable, but I'm not sure how to do that.
2008-01-14T01:34:00.000Z	MenZa	Darkmystere_	Yes, the patch is downloaded in that file.
2008-01-14T01:34:00.000Z	MenZa	Darkmystere_	that's SVN revision 2756 with the patch applied.
2008-01-14T01:36:00.000Z	MenZa	Darkmystere_	should be.
2008-01-14T01:36:00.000Z	MenZa	Darkmystere_	I've recompiled my madwifi about 3 times today.
2008-01-14T01:37:00.000Z	MenZa	Darkmystere_	huh?
