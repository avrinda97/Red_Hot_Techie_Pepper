2011-05-02T12:16:00.000Z	ben21		i an stuck at "Enabling additional executable binary formats binfmt-support" in tthe upgrad process from maverick what should i do now ?
2011-05-02T12:17:00.000Z	ben21		if i reboot i die?
2011-05-02T12:18:00.000Z	bullgard4	ben21	What do you mean by "I am stuck" precisely?
2011-05-02T12:19:00.000Z	ben21	bullgard4	it doesn't progress anymore, i don't now more
2011-05-02T12:20:00.000Z	bullgard4	ben21	So all your intervention cannot make that your upgrade process will progress?
2011-05-02T12:23:00.000Z	ben21	bullgard4	what all my intervention? i don't know what to do
2011-05-02T12:24:00.000Z	bullgard4	ben21	What happens if you simply press the Enter key?
2011-05-02T12:24:00.000Z	ben21	bullgard4	i get a new line
2011-05-02T12:25:00.000Z	bullgard4	ben21	But that is all? Ubuntu does not continue upgrading?
2011-05-02T12:25:00.000Z	ben21	bullgard4	yes exactly
2011-05-02T12:26:00.000Z	ben21	bullgard4	also the upgrad windows seems frozen since i can"t hide/display the terminal part
2011-05-02T12:28:00.000Z	bullgard4	ben21	If the upgrade windows seems frozen, this seems normal because the upgrade process  should not be interrupted.
2011-05-02T12:29:00.000Z	ben21	bullgard4	ok that's a releaf so what now ?
2011-05-02T12:29:00.000Z	ben21	bullgard4	i sould avoid rebooting ever, maybe i'get a nice uptime then
2011-05-02T12:31:00.000Z	bullgard4	ben21	I  do not know how to help you. This never happed with me at my many upgrades. --  I am afraid that you will need abandoning the upgrade process. This is very deplorable.
2011-05-02T12:32:00.000Z	ben21	bullgard4	i there a clean/safe way out ?
2011-05-02T12:33:00.000Z	bullgard4	ben21	No.
