2008-10-31T02:25:00.000Z	lhamil64	DasEi1	I'm sort of back at the beginning now (lol) I thought, "well I think that gParted will be easier to resize a partition" so I opened it and i really don't know what to put in for values when I go to resize my Windows partiton

2008-10-31T02:30:00.000Z	lhamil64	DasEi1	I could just try to do it in the installer or something and then hope i did it right :) this isn't my main machine and the xp install is pretty fresh so I don't really care if i hose it
2008-10-31T02:32:00.000Z	lhamil64	DasEi1	I pasted in the ammount in megs (81920) for 80gigs. I haven't done anything yet but it looks like it will partition it in half and leave the rest as unallocated space
