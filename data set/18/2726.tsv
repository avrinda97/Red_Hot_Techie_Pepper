2010-03-07T02:36:00.000Z	Guest5226		not working: only AUDIO, video not displaying
2010-03-07T02:37:00.000Z	Guest5226		any converter from WMV to somethin else?
2010-03-07T02:37:00.000Z	joeG	Guest5226	you need to install the codec packs.  I can't remember them off the top of my head, but if you google for it it should come up.
2010-03-07T02:38:00.000Z	Guest5226	joeG	ok. then I ll have to play this file in a Mac... how can I do this?
2010-03-07T02:39:00.000Z	joeG	Guest5226	Are you asking me how to play it on the mac or how to install the codecs?
2010-03-07T02:40:00.000Z	Guest5226	joeG	the codecs should be ok. I m asking you how could I convert that to a .avi or whatever
2010-03-07T02:43:00.000Z	joeG	Guest5226	In order to re-encode the vid, you would first have to be able to read it :)    I remember having to do something with the medibuntu repositories to get them all working right (the codecs)
2010-03-07T02:44:00.000Z	Guest5226	joeG	ok so I go for the codecs. I thought i already installed ubuntu-restricted
2010-03-07T02:45:00.000Z	joeG	Guest5226	like I mentioned before, you may have to pull from the medibuntu repositories.  That's what I had to do back in Jaunty when I needed to do some editing.  A google should pull up the directions.
2010-03-07T02:46:00.000Z	Guest5226	joeG	gstreamer is not installed, that may help. I ll then try kinoDV
2010-03-07T02:49:00.000Z	Guest5226	joeG	libav win 32 codecs and gstreamer were not there
2010-03-07T02:51:00.000Z	Guest5226	joeG	alsamixer and alsactl store maybe?
2010-03-07T02:52:00.000Z	joeG	Guest5226	Yeah, but then the dynamic changing of them brings both channels together again.  I basically want to forbid the change of the channel at all.
2010-03-07T02:53:00.000Z	joeG	Guest5226	would that lock it down and disallow any future changes to the channel?
2010-03-07T02:54:00.000Z	Guest5226	joeG	that would mute it. but you could later on change it again. future changes made by user would be crashing your settings
2010-03-07T02:54:00.000Z	joeG	Guest5226	Yeah, that's what I'm looking to work around.
2010-03-07T02:56:00.000Z	joeG	Guest5226	Yeah...  I've been searching online hoping to find something.  I'm just honestly surprised that there isn't something easy to make them work with noise-canceling mics.
2010-03-07T02:57:00.000Z	joeG	Guest5226	I don't suspect that the lock-downs would include the granularity of a "Per Channel" lock.
