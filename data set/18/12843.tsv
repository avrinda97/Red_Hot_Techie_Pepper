2007-04-01T10:09:00.000Z	rredd4		what is the name of the of the winamp plugin for firefox?  I did a cache and synaptic search for winamp, did not find anything
2007-04-01T10:09:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	rredd4	try xmms
2007-04-01T10:11:00.000Z	rredd4	PresuntoRJ	 ok, do I add xmms as a helper app, or ?
2007-04-01T10:12:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	rredd4	xmms is a player much like winamp (there is even a skin to look like that)
2007-04-01T10:12:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	rredd4	with the proper codecs in place, any app to use sound will use the codec, not the xmms it self
2007-04-01T10:13:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	rredd4	there is also the extremely light beep-media-player
2007-04-01T10:13:00.000Z	rredd4	PresuntoRJ	 ok, but the web site that I am using allows me to play video via firefox.  I don't know the videos url
2007-04-01T10:13:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	rredd4	oooh, video
2007-04-01T10:13:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	rredd4	mplayer and mplayer-plugins
2007-04-01T10:14:00.000Z	rredd4	PresuntoRJ	 I thought I had that, but will check..brb
2007-04-01T10:14:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	rredd4	actually: $ sudo apt-get install mplayer mozilla-mplayer
2007-04-01T10:15:00.000Z	rredd4	PresuntoRJ	 I went to syaptic and installed mozilla-mplayer
2007-04-01T10:16:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	rredd4	close and start firefox again, it must work
2007-04-01T10:16:00.000Z	rredd4	PresuntoRJ	 This web page is asking for winamp, will the mozilla plugin over ride that?
2007-04-01T10:16:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	rredd4	it still depends on the propper codecs, such as for WMV and RA
2007-04-01T10:17:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	rredd4	DIVx, XVid, AVI, ...
2007-04-01T10:17:00.000Z	rredd4	PresuntoRJ	 I upgraded to edgy, not sure if edgy kept my old (or upgraded) my codecs
2007-04-01T10:19:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	rredd4	hopefully
