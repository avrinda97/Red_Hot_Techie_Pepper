2010-08-11T17:18:00.000Z	termtermterm		Hello, I have a ubuntu server, just has root, what is the super-easy, normal, user-oriented way of saying "create a new user, copy the skel files, and add them as sudoer, exactle like a default user in ubuntu"
2010-08-11T17:19:00.000Z	termtermterm		and don't say adduser unless you mean it (because it doesn't)
2010-08-11T17:19:00.000Z	termtermterm		so, how do you really make a new user, with one argument (for blank password) or two arguments (to set password)
2010-08-11T17:20:00.000Z	termtermterm		let me tell you the api I want, and you see if it exists, or argue that I am stupid
2010-08-11T17:20:00.000Z	termtermterm		createDefaultUbuntuUser(String username, String password);
2010-08-11T17:20:00.000Z	termtermterm		that would be nice
2010-08-11T17:20:00.000Z	termtermterm		any luck with that?
2010-08-11T17:20:00.000Z	termtermterm		how to create a new, default, like out of the box, ubuntu user?
2010-08-11T17:20:00.000Z	termtermterm		in one command
2010-08-11T17:21:00.000Z	dominick	termtermterm	adduser username
2010-08-11T17:21:00.000Z	termtermterm	dominick	see my previous message, that is incorrect
2010-08-11T17:21:00.000Z	termtermterm	dominick	try it yourself, adduser is fundementally flawed and doesn't add to the default groups (no sudo)
2010-08-11T17:22:00.000Z	dominick	termtermterm	you must manually add to sudo "visudo"
2010-08-11T17:22:00.000Z	termtermterm	dominick	yes, I know, I just saud the same thing, topyli you are wrong
2010-08-11T17:23:00.000Z	dominick	termtermterm	not everyone should be given sudo rights. If you still want to add your custome adduser settings, read the linux administration guide to adding new users.
2010-08-11T17:24:00.000Z	termtermterm	dominick	please reference where I suggest all users should be sudoers. i am not saying that. Yeah, but it should already exist.DRY. how are people working without standard, abstracted and good APIs?
2010-08-11T17:26:00.000Z	dominick	termtermterm	try creating an alias. Although, can you add an input parameter to alias?
2010-08-11T17:26:00.000Z	termtermterm	dominick	good point... probably not, because it evals? I can just add a function to my bashrc though
