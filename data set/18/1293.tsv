2012-01-09T22:26:00.000Z	epod		Can anyone tell me how Ubuntu runs on the Asus Transformer?
2012-01-09T22:27:00.000Z	tj2	epod	it runs alright on the Transformer
2012-01-09T22:28:00.000Z	tj2	epod	but you need to be careful because if you get one of the new ones, nvflash might not work correctly so you wont be able to install ubuntu
2012-01-09T22:29:00.000Z	tj2	epod	I think it's anything Transformer with a serial number that starts above B60k
2012-01-09T22:29:00.000Z	epod	tj2	yeah I can't nvflash, though i'm rooted and have CWM installed, custom ROM, etc.  Do I still need nvflash?
2012-01-09T22:30:00.000Z	epod	tj2	I also have no idea what serial number mine is, the box got destroyed by my cat, and I peeled the sticker off without thinking.
2012-01-09T22:30:00.000Z	tj2	epod	I wasn't able to find any way to install ubuntu without nvflash
2012-01-09T22:31:00.000Z	tj2	epod	I think that there's a way to check if you have a mac
2012-01-09T22:31:00.000Z	tj2	epod	Let me see
2012-01-09T22:32:00.000Z	epod	tj2	ty
2012-01-09T22:38:00.000Z	tj2	epod	I
2012-01-09T22:39:00.000Z	tj2	epod	I'm sorry but I can't find the files on my computer or the site in any of my bookmarks. I do think it was the guy lilstevie who wrote a quick mac shell script that would give you the Transformer's serial number
2012-01-09T22:40:00.000Z	epod	tj2	I'll check Xda-developers, if such a thing is floating around, it'll be there.  Thanks!
2012-01-09T22:40:00.000Z	tj2	epod	Good luck. Sorry I couldn't help more
2012-01-09T22:43:00.000Z	epod	tj2	Found APX mode device Chip UID: 0x388920944212117 Detected SBKv2 - I assume this means no nvflash?
2012-01-09T22:46:00.000Z	tj2	epod	Yeah, as far as I know only SBKv2 was the updated version that prevented nvflash from working correctly
2012-01-09T22:46:00.000Z	tj2	epod	Sorry, I meant to say only SBKv1 could use nvflash
2012-01-09T22:47:00.000Z	epod	tj2	bother.  Well, i can chroot I suppose.
