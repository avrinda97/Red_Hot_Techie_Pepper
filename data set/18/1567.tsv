2011-06-24T18:02:00.000Z	rns		i fI install pacakges with apt-get, and then I do apt-get upgrade, will it only add bug fixes or will it upgrade to the latest version of the pacakge?
2011-06-24T18:02:00.000Z	iceroot	rns	only security-updates
2011-06-24T18:05:00.000Z	rns	iceroot	so I would need to manually upgrade to a new version?
2011-06-24T18:13:00.000Z	iceroot	rns	chaddy is wrong apt-get upgrade will upgrade your packages to the newest version form the repos. and newest version = security update
2011-06-24T18:14:00.000Z	rns	iceroot	so using firefox as an example - would apt-get upgrade take me from FF4 to FF5?
2011-06-24T18:15:00.000Z	iceroot	rns	in 11.04 yes bit that is a special case
2011-06-24T18:15:00.000Z	rns	iceroot	or for django, from django 1.0 to django 1.3?
2011-06-24T18:15:00.000Z	iceroot	rns	with other programs you only get the security update
2011-06-24T18:15:00.000Z	iceroot	rns	no
2011-06-24T18:15:00.000Z	iceroot	rns	as i said, backports are for that case
2011-06-24T18:16:00.000Z	rns	iceroot	so what's the difference between update and upgrade?
2011-06-24T18:16:00.000Z	iceroot	rns	apt-get update will update the sources-list, apt-get upgrade will upgrade the packages, apt-get dist-upgrade will also upgrade dependecies
2011-06-24T18:17:00.000Z	rns	iceroot	okay, so if I just want security updates, but I don't want to upgrade the version of the package, then I use apt-get update?
2011-06-24T18:17:00.000Z	iceroot	rns	no
2011-06-24T18:18:00.000Z	iceroot	rns	you use this to get the latest security updates for all packages "sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade"
2011-06-24T18:19:00.000Z	rns	iceroot	won't dist-upgrade upgrade me from version a to version b?
2011-06-24T18:20:00.000Z	iceroot	rns	no
2011-06-24T18:20:00.000Z	iceroot	rns	see man apt-get for the difference betwenn update, upgrade and dist-upgrade or see what i wrote above :)
