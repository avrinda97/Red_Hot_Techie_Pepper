2008-09-19T08:27:00.000Z	smm289		then under that it has a .rpm download, Redhat package
2008-09-19T08:28:00.000Z	chubs	smm289	alien if you must
2008-09-19T08:29:00.000Z	chubs	smm289	sudo apt-get install alien, then alien realplayerwhatever.rpm
2008-09-19T08:29:00.000Z	chubs	smm289	not a big deal if it doesn't, just fails, but it might be your only option if there is no source
2008-09-19T08:30:00.000Z	chubs	smm289	chmod +x realwhatever.bin  (is it executable?)
2008-09-19T08:30:00.000Z	chubs	smm289	all of them
2008-09-19T08:32:00.000Z	chubs	smm289	okay now ./realthing.bin
2008-09-19T08:33:00.000Z	chubs	smm289	or double click it i guess, but it might be a text only script
2008-09-19T08:34:00.000Z	chubs	smm289	congrats. do that next time you've got a .bin
2008-09-19T08:35:00.000Z	chubs	smm289	I hope not, you are on ubuntu right ;)?
2008-09-19T08:35:00.000Z	chubs	smm289	because it doesn't read your mind
2008-09-19T08:39:00.000Z	chubs	smm289	it seemed to be working when it was installing for UNIX ;)
2008-09-19T08:40:00.000Z	chubs	smm289	assuming you installed it to /home/something then yes
2008-09-19T08:48:00.000Z	chubs	smm289	it's faster than using a mouse
2008-09-19T08:49:00.000Z	smm289	chubs	I hear people say that, but I don't understand how that is possible.  Take that .bin file for instance, I had to  go to the command line and type out three commands, would have been quicker if I could have just double clicked it
2008-09-19T08:50:00.000Z	chubs	smm289	if double clicking it would run three commands, then yes. But to accomplish the same task that you did in the command line in three commands would take a bit longer with your gui
2008-09-19T08:52:00.000Z	chubs	smm289	that works on ubuntu with .deb packages. It would've worked on that .bin if realplayer had sent it to you as an executable. They didn't because it's good practice not to, so you made it so yourself
2008-09-19T08:53:00.000Z	chubs	smm289	if you know the package you want it's much faster to install via sudo apt-get
