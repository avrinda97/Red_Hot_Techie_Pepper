2010-01-25T03:23:00.000Z	Darks7ar		I have a downclocking problem i think
2010-01-25T03:24:00.000Z	Darks7ar		can u help
2010-01-25T03:25:00.000Z	Darks7ar		well i don't know if thats the exact statement but my pc runc better after a game for example was running
2010-01-25T03:25:00.000Z	Darks7ar		then after short period of time the pc just becomes slower
2010-01-25T03:25:00.000Z	Darks7ar		its faster even if the game is running
2010-01-25T03:26:00.000Z	Darks7ar		yep
2010-01-25T03:26:00.000Z	Darks7ar		most PCs have that option in the bios
2010-01-25T03:27:00.000Z	Darks7ar		and the difference is definately noticable
2010-01-25T03:27:00.000Z	Slart	Darks7ar	have you looked at cpu frequency scaling? ie power saving features?
2010-01-25T03:32:00.000Z	Slart	Darks7ar	look in synaptic.. search for "frequency scaling" or powernow.. you can try installing one of those packages
2010-01-25T03:32:00.000Z	Slart	Darks7ar	there's also cpufrequtils
2010-01-25T03:32:00.000Z	Darks7ar	Slart	 neither it is
2010-01-25T03:33:00.000Z	Slart	Darks7ar	hmm.. then I don't really know what to try.. it's a brand new laptop? brand new model as well?
2010-01-25T03:34:00.000Z	Darks7ar	Slart	Acer Extensa 5635ZG with 3gig ram and pentium dual core 2.10
