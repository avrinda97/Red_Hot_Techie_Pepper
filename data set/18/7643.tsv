2008-03-16T03:18:00.000Z	DOOM_NX	Pelo	i am searching but i can't find anything :(
2008-03-16T03:19:00.000Z	Pelo	DOOM_NX	 I don'T know much about it , but I'm willing to give it a shot,  can you define a bit more what you mean by switching channel ?
2008-03-16T03:20:00.000Z	DOOM_NX	Pelo	see: I've connected 4 speakers on my soundcard. 2 front 2 rear. The front ones are playing fine. But the rear ones (due to wire length limitations) have to be swaped. This means Rear Right channel should play the sound of Rear Left and vice versa. How can I do it?
2008-03-16T03:21:00.000Z	Pelo	DOOM_NX	ok I get the issue,  let me investigate a bit and get back to you , hold on
2008-03-16T03:24:00.000Z	DOOM_NX	Pelo	swapping all left with all right speakers can work too, i can psysically swap front speakers' cables
