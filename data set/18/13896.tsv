2007-10-15T14:34:00.000Z	pvh		So... anyone here ever formatted their ext partition to fat32 by mistake?
2007-10-15T14:35:00.000Z	soundray	pvh	fortunately not. Why, is that what happened to you?
2007-10-15T14:35:00.000Z	pvh	soundray	yep.
2007-10-15T14:36:00.000Z	pvh	soundray	at the moment, i am completely and utterly screwed.
2007-10-15T14:36:00.000Z	soundray	pvh	oh, that was my next question, how did you format...
2007-10-15T14:37:00.000Z	soundray	pvh	unfortunately, I don't think there's much you can do, except employ forensic experts for thousands of <insert your favorite currency unit>
2007-10-15T14:37:00.000Z	pvh	soundray	actually, that's not true
2007-10-15T14:37:00.000Z	pvh	soundray	there are a number of excellent resources available
2007-10-15T14:37:00.000Z	pvh	soundray	unfortunately i'm not sure which to pick
2007-10-15T14:37:00.000Z	soundray	pvh	oh, so you just came here to chat about it.
2007-10-15T14:38:00.000Z	pvh	soundray	sort of -- i have a deadline at 8:30am
2007-10-15T14:38:00.000Z	pvh	soundray	so i'm trying to find someone who has been through this and can help me get through without getting me fired
2007-10-15T14:39:00.000Z	soundray	pvh	surely, if they're vital, the ones on the ext3 weren't the only copies?!
2007-10-15T14:39:00.000Z	pvh	soundray	not helpful.
2007-10-15T14:40:00.000Z	pvh	soundray	:)
2007-10-15T14:40:00.000Z	soundray	pvh	no, I know, you've set the stakes to high
2007-10-15T14:41:00.000Z	soundray	pvh	maybe that's the first thing to do: get your deadline extended
2007-10-15T14:41:00.000Z	pvh	soundray	not an option.
