2007-10-30T05:42:00.000Z	LjL	SpeakerMania	it's cat5 cable with some wires swapped in order to connect to ethernet cards together rather than an ethernet card to a hub/switch/router
2007-10-30T05:43:00.000Z	LjL	SpeakerMania	you check if the wires coloring is replicated at both ends
2007-10-30T05:45:00.000Z	LjL	SpeakerMania	you will have to setup a static IP configuration on both machines.
2007-10-30T05:45:00.000Z	LjL	SpeakerMania	or make one serve DHCP
2007-10-30T05:45:00.000Z	LjL	SpeakerMania	an internet protocol connection where you input the parameters manually.
2007-10-30T05:46:00.000Z	LjL	SpeakerMania	control panel, network connections, right click, properties, tcp/ip, properties
2007-10-30T05:48:00.000Z	LjL	SpeakerMania	that won't work unless you have a DHCP server on the linux machine you're connecting to.
2007-10-30T05:49:00.000Z	LjL	SpeakerMania	use 192.168.0.1 as the ip address on one machine, and 192.168.0.2 on the other
2007-10-30T05:49:00.000Z	LjL	SpeakerMania	no
2007-10-30T05:50:00.000Z	LjL	SpeakerMania	192.168.0.1 should be fine on both
2007-10-30T05:51:00.000Z	LjL	SpeakerMania	you don't have a DNS server, so leave that alone
2007-10-30T05:52:00.000Z	LjL	SpeakerMania	i know how to do it by editing /etc/network/interfaces, but there's something called Network Manager on Ubuntu by default, which kind of gets in the way. i don't know the GNOME way either
2007-10-30T05:55:00.000Z	LjL	SpeakerMania	if you already know how to transfer files... from the console, it's "sudo mount //192.168.0.1/SomeWindowsSharedFolderName /Some/Directory/On/Linux -o username=you"... from GNOME, no idea
2007-10-30T05:56:00.000Z	LjL	SpeakerMania	assuming you gave 192.168.0.1 to the windows machine, that is
