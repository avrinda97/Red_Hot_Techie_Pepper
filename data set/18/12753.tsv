2006-06-21T09:47:00.000Z	carpediem	kditty	have you tried unplugging the ipod and plugging back in?
2006-06-21T09:47:00.000Z	carpediem	kditty	and, may I suggest giving banshee a try...it works with the IPod quite well.
2006-06-21T09:49:00.000Z	kditty	carpediem	i tried unplugging and connecting again, seems like thats when the problem started. when i plug it in and try to run gtkpod it give me an error about the ipod.db file.
2006-06-21T09:50:00.000Z	carpediem	kditty	no, in fact that's good
2006-06-21T09:50:00.000Z	carpediem	kditty	if you format it under Mac, you can't read it in Linux
2006-06-21T09:51:00.000Z	carpediem	kditty	but I don't know about the db error.
2006-06-21T09:51:00.000Z	kditty	carpediem	the files i deleted were gone, and the files i added are there, so i know that gtkpod did the job. also how do i go about disconnecting my ipod safely instead of unplugging it?
2006-06-21T09:51:00.000Z	carpediem	kditty	well, I don't think you have to umount a USB device like on Windows.
2006-06-21T09:51:00.000Z	carpediem	kditty	But I could be wrong
2006-06-21T09:53:00.000Z	carpediem	kditty	if the module is hung, it'
2006-06-21T09:53:00.000Z	carpediem	kditty	if the module is hung, it's possible you could rmmod it, then modprobe it
2006-06-21T09:53:00.000Z	kditty	carpediem	thanks, i wasnt sure if it mattered or not. im running banshee right now ill see if this works
2006-06-21T09:53:00.000Z	carpediem	kditty	yeah, try that.
2006-06-21T09:53:00.000Z	kditty	carpediem	i really dont know what youre talking about with rmmod and modprobe. im new to linux
2006-06-21T09:54:00.000Z	carpediem	kditty	well, in Windows terms, its kind of like unloading a driver, then loading it again.
2006-06-21T09:54:00.000Z	carpediem	kditty	lol, well, yeah, cept we don't reboot in Linux very often.
2006-06-21T09:55:00.000Z	carpediem	kditty	a driver in linux is usually a "kernel module"
2006-06-21T09:56:00.000Z	carpediem	kditty	well, one way, if you type "lsmod" you'll see the current list of drivers your kernel supports, and the ones that say they are loaded are the ones you are using.
