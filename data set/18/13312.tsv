2005-12-08T17:09:00.000Z	lightbright		all of a SUDDEN, Ubuntu is running real slow, everything takes ages to load and it seems when something opens, the refresh rates are down from 30 fps to 15fps as it draws windows on screen slowly!  What could have caused this?
2005-12-08T17:10:00.000Z	hlen	lightbright	maybe something is hogging your memory? G3 inside `top' might help you
2005-12-08T17:10:00.000Z	lightbright	hlen	 i ran top and what should I look for?
2005-12-08T17:11:00.000Z	lightbright	hlen	G3?
2005-12-08T17:12:00.000Z	hlen	lightbright	type `G3zbx>' in top and try to find some process with a huge VIRT size
2005-12-08T17:25:00.000Z	hlen	lightbright	_if you don't have anything important open in firefox_, `killall firefox' and see if it helps
2005-12-08T17:25:00.000Z	hlen	lightbright	that'll close your firefox windows
2005-12-08T17:25:00.000Z	lightbright	hlen	ok
2005-12-08T17:25:00.000Z	lightbright	hlen	it said: firefox: no process killed
2005-12-08T17:26:00.000Z	lightbright	hlen	I typed:  killall firefox
2005-12-08T17:26:00.000Z	hlen	lightbright	hrm, what's the name of the firefox binary? `pgrep -l firefox'
2005-12-08T17:29:00.000Z	hlen	lightbright	swapon -s and see if it lists hda2
2005-12-08T17:30:00.000Z	lightbright	hlen	when I typed your command it said: /dev/hda2                               partition       747012  104592  -1
2005-12-08T17:30:00.000Z	lightbright	hlen	 is that ok?
2005-12-08T17:30:00.000Z	hlen	lightbright	nothing to worry about. is your problem fixed?
2005-12-08T17:31:00.000Z	lightbright	hlen	so the swap is active and working?
2005-12-08T17:31:00.000Z	hlen	lightbright	yes
2005-12-08T17:36:00.000Z	lightbright	hlen	 thanks :)
