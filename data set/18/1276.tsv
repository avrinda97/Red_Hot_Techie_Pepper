2011-07-16T04:10:00.000Z	scoundrel50a		Hi, I was just wondering, what is the next version of Thunderbird, above 3.1.11, I think I got version 5 off Mozilla, it was a zip file, but it does show you how to install it. How do I install it?
2011-07-16T04:11:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	scoundrel50a	did you donwload a tar.gz file from mozilla.org (or something like the website)
2011-07-16T04:11:00.000Z	scoundrel50a		From Mozilla
2011-07-16T04:11:00.000Z	scoundrel50a		and yes it was a tar.gz file
2011-07-16T04:11:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	scoundrel50a	do you HAVE to uswe the version from mozilla, or do you just want thunderbird 5?
2011-07-16T04:12:00.000Z	scoundrel50a	kroq-gar78	I wante to try version 5,
2011-07-16T04:12:00.000Z	scoundrel50a	kroq-gar78	I have the file on my desktop
2011-07-16T04:13:00.000Z	scoundrel50a		but what I do with it, I dont know
2011-07-16T04:13:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	scoundrel50a	ok open up a terminal and run the following command "sudo add-apt-repository ppa:mozillateam/thunderbird-stable"
2011-07-16T04:14:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	scoundrel50a	it's safer (as in more stable probably) to get it from the ubuntu guys who did a few modifications to thunderbird and get auto-updates than get it from mozilla
2011-07-16T04:15:00.000Z	kroq-gar78		graagonstruckt: go to the menu, then do File -> Add radio statino
2011-07-16T04:15:00.000Z	scoundrel50a	kroq-gar78	I just did that, what next?
2011-07-16T04:15:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	scoundrel50a	then "sudo apt-get update"
2011-07-16T04:16:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	scoundrel50a	then, once that's finished, run "sudo apt-get upgrade"
2011-07-16T04:16:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	scoundrel50a	and then you should have it installed
2011-07-16T04:17:00.000Z	scoundrel50a	kroq-gar78	ok,l its going the the upgrade now
2011-07-16T04:17:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	scoundrel50a	cool just post back if any sort of problems, etc.
2011-07-16T04:18:00.000Z	scoundrel50a	kroq-gar78	ooh, that looks interesting.......I will let you know how I get on
