2011-01-11T20:29:00.000Z	elricsfate		For some reason it refuses to let me upgrade guys. Whenever I try and install and download the updates I get this error. Requires installation of untrusted packages The action would require the installation of packages from not authenticated sources.
2011-01-11T20:30:00.000Z	elricsfate		Can anyone help? I would really appreciate it.
2011-01-11T20:31:00.000Z	FCGreg	elricsfate	you probably allowed special repositories in the past for something, yes?  now it is just warning you that it needs to install unauthenticated packages during the upgrade as well.  does it not let you proceed?
2011-01-11T20:32:00.000Z	elricsfate	FCGreg	No. I cannot seem to proceed
2011-01-11T20:32:00.000Z	FCGreg	elricsfate	does that make sense that you installed some special packages/repositories in the past?
2011-01-11T20:33:00.000Z	elricsfate		FCGreg:Yes. I installed some different repo's and a few other apps from deb. I never had this problem before. Its recent.
2011-01-11T20:34:00.000Z	FCGreg	elricsfate	I'm assuming it doesn't give you an option/plus sign/etc. to see which packages or repos are affected?  btw, what kind of upgrade are you doing?
2011-01-11T20:35:00.000Z	elricsfate	FCGreg	Just a standard upgrade. Yes it shows me. Let me give you the output.

2011-01-11T20:37:00.000Z	elricsfate	FCGreg	Would you like my source.list to?

2011-01-11T20:42:00.000Z	elricsfate		think I may have fixed it
2011-01-11T20:42:00.000Z	elricsfate		thanks for the help though guys
2011-01-11T20:44:00.000Z	FCGreg	elricsfate	ok, glad to hear that.  it looks like the standard repository warning.  you should be able to work around it.  good luck
2011-01-11T20:44:00.000Z	FCGreg	elricsfate	sorry, had my client quit on me unexpectedly
