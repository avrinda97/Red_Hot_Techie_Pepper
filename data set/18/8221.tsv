2007-09-27T13:14:00.000Z	afd_		maybe I should go the manual way, of changing the apt sources file?
2007-09-27T13:16:00.000Z	afd_		yeah, I'm on feisty
2007-09-27T13:17:00.000Z	afd_		yesterday I was all day on an edgy workstation, my brain must have borked
2007-09-27T13:17:00.000Z	afd_		ok, now back to the question
2007-09-27T13:17:00.000Z	afd_		can I update from feisty to gutsy using the cdrom as apt source?
2007-09-27T13:17:00.000Z	afd_		actually, not the cdrom, the mounted loop cd image
2007-09-27T13:18:00.000Z	afd_		I don't have a cdrom in this machine
2007-09-27T13:18:00.000Z	heguru	afd_	you can add it as a cdrom apt source and yes you can then use it to upgrade to gutsy
2007-09-27T13:19:00.000Z	afd_	heguru	how can I do that if I don't have a cdrom drive? (this is one of the reasons I'm trying to upgrade, I have a SATA cdrom which panics the kernel)
2007-09-27T13:20:00.000Z	heguru	afd_	you can mount the iso image and then use it as a cdrom apt source
2007-09-27T13:22:00.000Z	afd_	heguru	could you please paste me a line for a cdrom source, I don't have any in my sources files, I don't know the syntax
2007-09-27T13:23:00.000Z	heguru	afd_	where are you mounting the .iso file?
2007-09-27T13:23:00.000Z	afd_	heguru	/home/afd/cdrom
2007-09-27T13:24:00.000Z	afd_	heguru	actually I found a line... deb cdrom:[Ubuntu 6.04 _edgy Drake_ - Alpha i386 (20060310)] / edgy main restricted
2007-09-27T13:24:00.000Z	heguru	afd_	well if you are going to mount the .iso
2007-09-27T13:25:00.000Z	heguru	afd_	you should use something like:  deb file:/home/jason/debian stable
2007-09-27T13:26:00.000Z	heguru	afd_	where /home/jason/debian should be changed to the mount point of the iso
2007-09-27T13:26:00.000Z	afd_	heguru	I think I got it, trying now, thanks!
