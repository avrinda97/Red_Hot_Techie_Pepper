2011-10-04T07:42:00.000Z	qin	bambanx	Or try: sudo apt-get autoremove

2011-10-04T07:48:00.000Z	qin	bambanx	locate wine - that one is crude, but dpkg -l wine1.3 tell you what system see.
2011-10-04T07:50:00.000Z	bambanx	qin	in /var/lib/dpkg/info/ i have  lot of wine files
2011-10-04T07:51:00.000Z	qin	bambanx	You do not want to touch them. In general visits to /var/lib/ should be avoided.
