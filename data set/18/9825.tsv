2007-02-17T11:57:00.000Z	xtknight	Desp	alright, go in to ubuntu recovery mode and i think you need to add your user to the sudo group
2007-02-17T11:57:00.000Z	xtknight	Desp	admin group rather?  not completely sure

2007-02-17T11:58:00.000Z	xtknight	Desp	in single user (Recovery Mode) ?
2007-02-17T11:59:00.000Z	xtknight	Desp	sorry.  su (single user) mode should just take you to a terminal and ask nothing about login
2007-02-17T12:00:00.000Z	xtknight	Desp	master ... ?
2007-02-17T12:05:00.000Z	xtknight	Desp	sorry i'm not sure
2007-02-17T12:05:00.000Z	xtknight	Desp	broken install maybe.
2007-02-17T12:07:00.000Z	xtknight	Desp	you'd have to start a livecd and then fix your broken local system from there.  it does not mean you set a pw, it means ubuntu is broken
2007-02-17T12:08:00.000Z	xtknight	Desp	that would be easiest
