2010-04-03T05:44:00.000Z	apatheticsheep		howdy folks,  I am trying to install wordpress on my ubuntu server.  so i figured i would do so the ubuntu blessed way and use apt-get.  after ward I tried to run the setup-mysql script and got an error.  "Access denied for user 'root@localhost'@'localhost'"
2010-04-03T05:45:00.000Z	cedriczg	apatheticsheep	What did you run for running that mysql script?
2010-04-03T05:46:00.000Z	apatheticsheep	cedriczg	I made a soft link in /var/www to /usr/share/blahblah
2010-04-03T05:48:00.000Z	apatheticsheep	cedriczg	why would it use the user root@localhost@localhost instead of jsut root@localhost or just root
2010-04-03T05:50:00.000Z	cedriczg	apatheticsheep	So what would be the actual command you run in order to run the script?
2010-04-03T05:54:00.000Z	cedriczg		Sorry to ask again. Does anyone have the battery monitor showing the time remaining in your ubuntu 9.10?
2010-04-03T05:55:00.000Z	apatheticsheep	cedriczg	bash /usr/share/doc/wordpress/examples/setup-mysql -n name fqdn
2010-04-03T06:00:00.000Z	cedriczg	apatheticsheep	did you try to run "bash /usr/share/doc/wordpress/examples/setup-mysql -n name --user=user --password fqdn"
2010-04-03T06:00:00.000Z	cedriczg	apatheticsheep	or something like that were you specify the user and that it should ask for password
2010-04-03T06:01:00.000Z	apatheticsheep	cedriczg	will give it a shot
2010-04-03T06:01:00.000Z	cedriczg	apatheticsheep	by the way. Are you running ubuntu on a laptop?
2010-04-03T06:02:00.000Z	apatheticsheep	cedriczg	no
2010-04-03T06:02:00.000Z	cedriczg	apatheticsheep	ok. thnx
2010-04-03T06:02:00.000Z	cedriczg		anyone here running ubuntu 9.10 on a laptop?
2010-04-03T06:04:00.000Z	cedriczg		ok, seems noone has a laptop on ubuntu here...
2010-04-03T06:05:00.000Z	apatheticsheep	cedriczg	don't seem to be able to pass mysql opts to this script like that. or atleast not in that order.
2010-04-03T06:06:00.000Z	cedriczg	apatheticsheep	those options work at least for the mysql command try to run "man setup-mysql" to see the options then
2010-04-03T06:07:00.000Z	cedriczg	apatheticsheep	or maybe that script does not have man pages...
