2011-08-15T21:03:00.000Z	Dexo		hey, is there any way to dualboot ubuntu desktop and ubuntu server?
2011-08-15T21:03:00.000Z	Pici	Dexo	Why would you do that?
2011-08-15T21:04:00.000Z	Dexo	Pici	so i can use the desktop and host my game server when im not using desktop
2011-08-15T21:04:00.000Z	Pici	Dexo	Do you realize that Ubuntu Desktop and Ubuntu server both use the same package repositories?
2011-08-15T21:05:00.000Z	Pici	Dexo	You can, I just don't see the use, since they are the same thing, just with different packages installed.
2011-08-15T21:07:00.000Z	Pici	Dexo	So you can turn off the service that provides the desktop environment.
2011-08-15T21:08:00.000Z	Dexo	Pici	how would i do that? im newish to  ubuntu.
2011-08-15T21:08:00.000Z	Pici	Dexo	sudo service gdm stop    or  start
2011-08-15T21:09:00.000Z	Dexo	Pici	and sudo server gdm start to re-enable the X?
2011-08-15T21:09:00.000Z	Pici	Dexo	service, not server.  But yes.
2011-08-15T21:09:00.000Z	Dexo	Pici	yea (typo)
2011-08-15T21:10:00.000Z	Dexo	Pici	restarting the computer would also re-enable the X right?
2011-08-15T21:12:00.000Z	Pici	Dexo	Correct.
2011-08-15T21:27:00.000Z	Pici	Dexo	Because you didn't know what to type? or some other reason?
2011-08-15T21:30:00.000Z	Pici	Dexo	Did you login?
2011-08-15T21:31:00.000Z	Pici	Dexo	You should see a login screen in one of your ttys.
2011-08-15T21:31:00.000Z	Pici	Dexo	at ctrl-alt-f1 (f7 to return to your desktop)
2011-08-15T21:34:00.000Z	Pici	Dexo	its 'gdm' and only if you want to stop the graphical interface.
