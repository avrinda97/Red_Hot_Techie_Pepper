2007-12-28T00:49:00.000Z	genii	prabhjot	 Vista makes iso13346 dvds when you make backups from it. There is a kernel patch on sourceforge but linux cannot natively use them
2007-12-28T00:51:00.000Z	prabhjot	genii	so , how do i get my data back? i didn't use Vista backups or anything of the sort, i only copied the data folder by folder, and made a mastered DVD under Nero
2007-12-28T00:52:00.000Z	genii	prabhjot	If you make a virtual machine for XP underneath ubuntu you should be able to read the dvds that way
2007-12-28T00:54:00.000Z	genii	prabhjot	There is also linux-udf project on sourceforge
2007-12-28T00:55:00.000Z	prabhjot	genii	Thanks a lot. I'll try.
2007-12-28T00:55:00.000Z	genii	prabhjot	The files seem somewhat old however (2004 seemed latest)
2007-12-28T00:56:00.000Z	genii	prabhjot	You may want to make sure you have package udftools installed and try within the virtual XP machine once more
2007-12-28T00:57:00.000Z	prabhjot	genii	ok. Shouldn't there be a built in command for reading the discs, coz the "mkisofs" already has an option to relax the iso9660 restrictions
2007-12-28T00:57:00.000Z	genii	prabhjot	Even if you have in fstab the fs type of udf it won't matter if udftools are not installed
2007-12-28T00:58:00.000Z	prabhjot	genii	well, i 've posted the complete details at http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=649887
2007-12-28T01:02:00.000Z	prabhjot	genii	shouldn't the udftools hav already been incorporated into the linux kernel itself, after all, i have Ubuntu Gutsy Gibbon
2007-12-28T01:03:00.000Z	genii	prabhjot	Not sure about if they were supposed to be there. On my Gutsy box here package udftools seems to exist independently however
2007-12-28T01:03:00.000Z	prabhjot	genii	ok, Thanks for your help :)
2007-12-28T01:13:00.000Z	prabhjot	genii	even now, it won't mount
2007-12-28T01:16:00.000Z	genii	prabhjot	Perhaps make an iso onto the computer of one of the dvds (by something like sudo dd if=/dev/dvd of=/somefile.iso) or /dev/sdX where X is the dvd drive letter etc...then you can experiment with loop mounting it with different options to see if any work
2007-12-28T01:18:00.000Z	prabhjot	genii	it copied only 2 kb. whereas the dvd is 4 GB
2007-12-28T01:19:00.000Z	genii	prabhjot	Hmm. I have no other immediate suggestions then :(
2007-12-28T01:20:00.000Z	prabhjot	genii	ok, thanks for trying to help
