2006-04-07T15:08:00.000Z	john27		does anyone know how to get ipw2200 wireless working in breezy
2006-04-07T15:08:00.000Z	crimsun	john27	should work by default.
2006-04-07T15:08:00.000Z	crimsun	john27	what sort of issue(s)?
2006-04-07T15:09:00.000Z	crimsun	john27	lsmod|grep ^ipw2200
2006-04-07T15:10:00.000Z	crimsun	john27	pastebin ``dmesg|grep ipw''
2006-04-07T15:12:00.000Z	john27	crimsun	are you there
2006-04-07T15:13:00.000Z	crimsun	john27	yes, I'm just busy. Hold.
2006-04-07T15:13:00.000Z	crimsun	john27	pastebin ``dmesg|grep -i ipw''
2006-04-07T15:15:00.000Z	crimsun	john27	are you _positive_ you have IPW hardware in it?
2006-04-07T15:15:00.000Z	crimsun	john27	pastebin ``lspci -v''
2006-04-07T15:16:00.000Z	crimsun	john27	next time please use pastebin as I asked
2006-04-07T15:18:00.000Z	crimsun	john27	and now, pastebin ``cat /proc/interrupts''
2006-04-07T15:26:00.000Z	john27	crimsun	did i do that correctly
2006-04-07T15:26:00.000Z	crimsun	john27	do you have multiple network adapters in that computer?
2006-04-07T15:29:00.000Z	crimsun	john27	yes, it looks like you'll have to do something similar, because your acpi config (hardware) is not assigning required resources to the ipw2000bg chipset
2006-04-07T15:38:00.000Z	crimsun	john27	^
2006-04-07T15:39:00.000Z	crimsun	john27	no, you don't _have_ to use the bios. Just unload the driver for your wired LAN controller.
2006-04-08T16:47:00.000Z	crimsun	john27	pong
