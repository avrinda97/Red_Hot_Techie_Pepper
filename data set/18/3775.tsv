2012-01-04T22:43:00.000Z	bw_		How do I stop daemons from executing at boot the right way? I have rtm.
2012-01-04T22:44:00.000Z	trism	bw_	if this is natty or later and the service has a script in /etc/init/ then you can: echo manual | sudo tee /etc/init/servicename.override; (replacing servicename with lightdm or ssh or whatever)
2012-01-04T22:45:00.000Z	bw_	trism	Thanks, I will take a look at this now.
2012-01-04T22:51:00.000Z	bw_	trism	Mind telling me what exactly that does? I see that it the word manual is piped into the file ssh.override, but how does that change anything?
2012-01-04T22:51:00.000Z	trism	bw_	upstart override files allow you to modify the start on and stop on conditions of a service without modifying its config
2012-01-04T22:53:00.000Z	bw_	trism	Gonna reboot and test, what parameters can the .overrides take? I can look it up, but figured I would ask anway.
2012-01-04T22:53:00.000Z	trism	bw_	http://upstart.at/2011/03/11/override-files-in-ubuntu-natty/ has a decent overview
2012-01-04T22:53:00.000Z	bw_	trism	thanks
2012-01-04T22:59:00.000Z	bw_	trism	is there any reason you can think of as to why this wouldn't have worked?
2012-01-04T23:00:00.000Z	trism	bw_	which version of ubuntu are you on?
2012-01-04T23:00:00.000Z	bw_	trism	natty 11.04
2012-01-04T23:03:00.000Z	trism	bw_	not sure, I'll take a look
2012-01-04T23:07:00.000Z	bw_	trism	may have found the solution..rebooting I will let you know.
2012-01-04T23:10:00.000Z	bw_	trism	Got it working.
2012-01-04T23:10:00.000Z	trism	bw_	excellent, how?
2012-01-04T23:11:00.000Z	bw_	trism	I was redirecting output to /etc/init.d instead of /etc/init -_-
2012-01-04T23:11:00.000Z	trism	bw_	ahh, that would do it, at least it is working now
2012-01-04T23:12:00.000Z	bw_	trism	yea, thanks for your help..it's always nice talking to someone who knows there *nix.
