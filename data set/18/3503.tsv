2011-10-13T22:05:00.000Z	theadmin	Oxymoron	Try out Photorec (included in the "testdisk" package in the repos)
2011-10-13T22:05:00.000Z	Oxymoron	theadmin	Whats photorec?
2011-10-13T22:06:00.000Z	theadmin	Oxymoron	A file recovery utility
2011-10-13T22:07:00.000Z	theadmin	Oxymoron	Open the dropbox website and click "Show deleted files"?
2011-10-13T22:07:00.000Z	Oxymoron	theadmin	Yes, of course and they are not there, only old files
2011-10-13T22:08:00.000Z	Oxymoron	theadmin	Yes, already tried bu they arent there either. it is like dropbox restored to previous state ON THEIR server and overwrite my files!
2011-10-13T22:09:00.000Z	Oxymoron	theadmin	My files suddenly disappeared earlier today when I should do the LAST on my long laboration project to show in school tomorrow.
2011-10-13T22:34:00.000Z	Oxymoron	theadmin	testdisk, does it work well? Can it restore files to original path with same filename?
2012-02-06T19:26:00.000Z	theadmin	Oxymoron	Only those, likely, well, you can ask in #ubuntu-devel if you're developing for Ubuntu
2012-02-06T19:28:00.000Z	Oxymoron	theadmin	Not developing for ubuntu, developing for a stupid teacher wants us todo sockets in C xD
2012-02-06T19:28:00.000Z	theadmin	Oxymoron	lol...
