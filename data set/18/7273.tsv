2008-01-17T16:45:00.000Z	am3r1ca	ActionParsnip	he had the same boot error, but he wasn able to connect. after manually inserting the MAC address (ive already tried that) he resolved his problem. mine is a little different. i acesso normally but am constantly disconnected. in windows i am able to establish connections day on end, so router and ISP works ok.
