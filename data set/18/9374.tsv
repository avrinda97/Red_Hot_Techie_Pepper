2008-07-27T09:20:00.000Z	moDumass		(initramfs) _
2008-07-27T09:20:00.000Z	moDumass		any idea why this has happened
2008-07-27T09:20:00.000Z	moDumass		for no reason
2008-07-27T09:20:00.000Z	xtknight	moDumass	are you using Hardy or Intrepid
2008-07-27T09:21:00.000Z	moDumass	xtknight	hardy
2008-07-27T09:21:00.000Z	xtknight	moDumass	and what motherboard/chipset do you have ?
2008-07-27T09:21:00.000Z	moDumass	xtknight	its a toshiba laptop
2008-07-27T09:22:00.000Z	xtknight	moDumass	have any linux distributions been run successfully on it or is this your first try.  or have others failed?
2008-07-27T09:23:00.000Z	moDumass	xtknight	i have been happily and sucessfully running hardy until i rebooted
2008-07-27T09:23:00.000Z	xtknight	moDumass	if you have other kernels listed in the boot menu can you see if these older ones work?
2008-07-27T09:25:00.000Z	moDumass	xtknight	nope, same error with older releases
2008-07-27T09:26:00.000Z	xtknight	moDumass	i am not sure what to say but if you recently had disk corruption of some kind, that could be it.  it doesn't work if you goto recovery mode?  do you use any kind of RAID?
2008-07-27T09:27:00.000Z	moDumass	xtknight	no raid, nothing special here
2008-07-27T09:27:00.000Z	xtknight	moDumass	i assume if you tried a livecd  right now it would boot just fine?
2008-07-27T09:27:00.000Z	xtknight	moDumass	hmm the program is called fsck but i am not sure that you can execute it from there
2008-07-27T09:29:00.000Z	xtknight	moDumass	the only solution i can see is to reinstall, i am not sure what the cause is
