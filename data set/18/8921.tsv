2007-06-12T15:52:00.000Z	^rike^		How can i stop update manager from updating a particular package?
2007-06-12T15:53:00.000Z	jrib	^rike^	I think update manager respects those settings...
2007-06-12T15:54:00.000Z	^rike^	jrib	i already tried the lock option and the packages appear pinned
2007-06-12T15:54:00.000Z	^rike^	jrib	but update-manager still updates the packages
2007-06-12T15:55:00.000Z	jrib	^rike^	what do you mean by "lock option"?
2007-06-12T15:57:00.000Z	^rike^	jrib	i oppened synaptic package manager, selected the package and chose the "lock version" option
2007-06-12T15:58:00.000Z	jrib	^rike^	yes, try what I said
2007-06-13T16:15:00.000Z	^rike^	jrib	i patched and rebuilt the package but it kept the same version of the package the system is trying to upgrade; could this be a problem to pinning?
2007-06-13T16:18:00.000Z	jrib	^rike^	you edited /etc/apt/preferences to pin your package version?
2007-06-13T16:19:00.000Z	^rike^	jrib	yes, but update-manager keeps trying to update it
2007-06-13T16:20:00.000Z	^rike^	jrib	but the package is trying to update as the same version as the package installed
2007-06-13T16:21:00.000Z	jrib	^rike^	ah, well when you patch your package, up the version (I append -1jrib1 or something similar...)
2007-06-13T16:21:00.000Z	^rike^	jrib	can I just rename the file?
2007-06-13T16:21:00.000Z	jrib	^rike^	rename what file?
2007-06-13T16:22:00.000Z	^rike^	jrib	the .deb that resulted from the patch
2007-06-13T16:23:00.000Z	jrib	^rike^	oh, no you need to update the changelog, run 'dch -i' in package-version directory
2007-06-13T16:24:00.000Z	^rike^	jrib	ah, ok, i'll try that
2007-06-13T05:20:00.000Z	^rike^	jrib	thank you very much for your help; after changing the changelog, rebuilding the package and installing it, i was able successfully do the pinning of the package
