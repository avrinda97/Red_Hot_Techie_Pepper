2009-06-21T10:33:00.000Z	Guest70571		hey guys
2009-06-21T10:35:00.000Z	Guest70571		I have a 400 mb avi file and want to reduce the file size to approximately 50mb with minimal quality loss - which format should I choose?
2009-06-21T10:36:00.000Z	Guest70571		hm
2009-06-21T10:36:00.000Z	Guest70571		I tried *.flv and it is quite good
2009-06-21T10:36:00.000Z	losher	Guest70571	that's almost a tenth the size. Hard to keep quality up at those kind of compression rates...
2009-06-21T10:38:00.000Z	losher	Guest70571	well first, what resolution (per voss) & codec does the current avi use. Use mplayer to identify it...
2009-06-21T10:39:00.000Z	Guest70571	losher	resolution is 720x576, codec: dvsd
2009-06-21T10:41:00.000Z	losher	Guest70571	I agree with Slart, see if avidemux will open it...
2009-06-21T10:41:00.000Z	Guest70571	losher	it does
2009-06-21T10:42:00.000Z	losher	Guest70571	and where do you plan to play this file after its compressed?
2009-06-21T10:43:00.000Z	Guest70571	losher	normal video player - the problem is: I want to give it a friend via the internet
2009-06-21T10:43:00.000Z	Guest70571	losher	50-100 mb. would be okay
2009-06-21T10:44:00.000Z	losher	Guest70571	not sure what you mean by 'normal video player'. Will he play it on his PC?
2009-06-21T10:45:00.000Z	Guest70571	losher	sorry, yes, good would be, if he can open it on his pc with windows media player (for example)
2009-06-21T10:47:00.000Z	losher	Guest70571	I'm not sure what windows media player supports. Slart?
2009-06-21T10:52:00.000Z	losher	Guest70571	if all else fails: http://www.gentoo-wiki.info/TIP_Encode_Video_for_Windows_Media_player
2009-06-21T10:53:00.000Z	Guest70571	losher	thank you for your help!
2009-06-21T10:53:00.000Z	losher	Guest70571	such as it was....
