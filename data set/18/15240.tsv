2005-05-29T13:02:00.000Z	hondje	mpq	ctrl-alt-backspace together
2005-05-29T13:03:00.000Z	mpq	hondje	it doesn't

2005-06-01T12:30:00.000Z	hondje	mpq	unrar-nonfree
2005-06-01T13:10:00.000Z	hondje	mpq	me too
2005-06-01T13:10:00.000Z	hondje	mpq	hehe...I've been doing it 5 years, I've come to the conclusion I'll be a prepetual newbie
2005-06-01T16:06:00.000Z	hondje	mpq	tons of various open source projects are on freenode, along with general nerd interest chans like #math
2005-06-01T16:08:00.000Z	hondje	mpq	~290 people there
2005-06-01T16:15:00.000Z	mpq	hondje	there's a difference between user-friendly and newbie
2005-06-01T16:15:00.000Z	hondje	mpq	of course, but it's definately recommended for newbies :)
