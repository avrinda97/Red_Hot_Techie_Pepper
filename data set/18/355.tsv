2012-03-28T17:44:00.000Z	Pici	yzhd	its because he is directing his comments to you (your name is that the front of his message)
2012-03-28T17:50:00.000Z	Pici	yzhd	Are you sure that the installer isn't on another virtual desktop?
2012-04-16T23:42:00.000Z	Pici	yzhd	You forgot the first part of your command.   shouldn't it be: git init -u git://github.com/CyanogenMod/android.git -b gingerbread
2012-04-16T23:42:00.000Z	yzhd	Pici	have no idea :/ I'm following this guide : http://wiki.cyanogenmod.com/wiki/HTC_Desire_(GSM):_Compile_CyanogenMod_(Linux)
2012-04-16T23:45:00.000Z	Pici	yzhd	Ah, I see. Can you try doing:    source ~/.profile    and see if that fixes it?

2012-04-16T23:48:00.000Z	Pici	yzhd	It sounds pretty self explanitory.  Yes.
2012-04-16T23:53:00.000Z	yzhd	Pici	there was a command that showed the size of a folder. Which one was that? I CD'ed then ls something

2012-04-16T23:55:00.000Z	yzhd	Pici	one last question :D A week or two ago.. I download a program that edited the fonts.. and the circle loading thing on the mouse etc... You have any idea on what the name of that program can be? I have uninstalled it. It was a common program. I'm searching, but can't find anything
2012-04-16T23:56:00.000Z	Pici	yzhd	Uhh... I'm not sure, sorry.  I'm not much of a gui person.
2012-04-16T23:57:00.000Z	yzhd	Pici	I see. Thanks for all your help though! I appreciate it :)
