2009-10-18T02:45:00.000Z	al_		ELLo where can I get the howto for xchat?
2009-10-18T02:47:00.000Z	guntbert	al_	click on help/get help online
2009-12-06T02:31:00.000Z	guntbert	al_	command --delete
2009-12-06T02:33:00.000Z	guntbert	al_	what command?
2009-12-06T02:34:00.000Z	al_	guntbert	rsync
2009-12-06T02:35:00.000Z	al_	guntbert	I think you are right, you issue the --delete, or --delete-before on its own
2009-12-06T02:36:00.000Z	guntbert	al_	-e means --rsh=Command - (just the same line)
2009-12-06T02:37:00.000Z	al_	guntbert	I am using rsync with -Pauvz --delete which I think results in perfect mirror image of source and target?
2009-12-06T02:38:00.000Z	guntbert	al_	I'm not too sure, every time I use it I do look up the switches one by one :-)
2009-12-06T02:53:00.000Z	guntbert	al_	look at screen
2009-12-06T02:53:00.000Z	al_	guntbert	yeah, I know about screen, the problem is that the remote machine is a NAS running some cutdown variant of linux
2009-12-06T02:54:00.000Z	guntbert	al_	then there is nohup <command> &
2009-12-06T02:55:00.000Z	al_	guntbert	this is for the rsync command
2009-12-06T02:55:00.000Z	al_	guntbert	will the rysnc log help
2009-12-06T02:56:00.000Z	guntbert	al_	you can do something like nohup rsync ..... &, it finishes its job and you can read the logs later
2009-12-06T02:56:00.000Z	al_	guntbert	will man nohup
2009-12-06T02:57:00.000Z	guntbert	al_	and don't forget the & at the end
