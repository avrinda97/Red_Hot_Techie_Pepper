2006-11-03T06:55:00.000Z	karl		what's the trick with getting flash to work in ff2.0 and edgy?
2006-11-03T06:55:00.000Z	karl		I apt-get dist-upgraded from dapper, and now every flash site kills firefox.
2006-11-03T06:56:00.000Z	grndslm	karl	you've installed flashplugin-nonfree, right??
2006-11-03T06:58:00.000Z	karl	grndslm	yes, I have flashplugin-nonfree, and I know that uninstalling it makes firefox not crash.
2006-11-03T06:59:00.000Z	grndslm	karl	try adding this line to the end of /usr/bin/firefox:  export XLIB_SKIP_ARGB_VISUALS=1
2006-11-03T07:00:00.000Z	karl	grndslm	does this actually work for some people? what is wrong with my system that I need an xlib param?
2006-11-03T07:02:00.000Z	grndslm	karl	flash doesn't make firefox crash on my computer...i read before i even upgraded to edgy that the xlib line fixed the crashing...so i did it automatically, and don't even know if that's the solution...but it couldn't hurt for you to try it
2006-11-03T07:03:00.000Z	grndslm	karl	also...you might want to try downloading the flashblock extension for firefox....if you've got a buncha tabs open with flash movies, or ads, or whatever...it stops all of them until you grant each one permission to play with the click of a button
2006-11-03T07:03:00.000Z	karl	grndslm	well, the xlib line works.
2006-11-03T07:03:00.000Z	grndslm	karl	good to hear...
2006-11-03T07:05:00.000Z	grndslm	karl	overall, i'm happy with the improvements in edgy...seems like all the packages i need are up to date and pretty damn stable...and i definitely enjoy shaving 25~30 sec off every boot
2006-11-03T07:06:00.000Z	karl	grndslm	I wish it had been so nice for me.
2006-11-03T07:06:00.000Z	grndslm	karl	i prolly would have stuck with dapper, but i wanted mythtv 0.20...and it was in the edgy repository for, so it was a no-brainer....and i've definitely never dist-upgraded and prolly never will
2006-11-03T07:06:00.000Z	karl	grndslm	yeah, I should have known, I normally just backup /home and reinstall
2006-11-03T07:07:00.000Z	karl	grndslm	yeah, and I do, but it doesn't give you any of the new desktop tweaks :)
2006-11-03T07:09:00.000Z	grndslm	karl	by tweaks do you mean compiz?
2006-11-03T07:09:00.000Z	karl	grndslm	I don't know what compiz is, but any of the default desktop settings.
2006-11-03T07:10:00.000Z	grndslm	karl	if you want default desktop settings...you can just delete all your the ".*" (or hidden) files in your /home dir
