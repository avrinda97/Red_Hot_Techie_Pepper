2007-03-16T07:15:00.000Z	reborn		hello, can some one help me , i have been getting some weird problems ..
2007-03-16T07:16:00.000Z	reborn		it was working just fine yesterday , then i had some bugs going on when i installed kiba-dock
2007-03-16T07:16:00.000Z	derelm	reborn	you will have to be more specific about your problems to get meaningful help
2007-03-16T07:18:00.000Z	reborn	derelm	its like this i can open google, but not yahoo, i can open microsoft but not appe, and the when i try to run the upgrade manager it downloads some upgrades but not others...
2007-03-16T07:19:00.000Z	derelm	reborn	which version of ubuntu did you install?
2007-03-16T07:19:00.000Z	reborn	derelm	 the lates...
2007-03-16T07:19:00.000Z	derelm	reborn	the latest stable (edgy eft) or the latest unstable (feisty fawn)?
2007-03-16T07:20:00.000Z	reborn	derelm	 edgy
2007-03-16T07:21:00.000Z	derelm	reborn	the ipv6 might help you.  the other thing, is that just another partition of your hd which you don't see or is it a real 2 disk?
2007-03-16T07:22:00.000Z	reborn	derelm	yeah its anothe hd it worked on my last install, but i cant see it now.. altho the bios an dthe install software sees it
2007-03-16T07:23:00.000Z	derelm	reborn	can't see it as in 'there is no /dev/hda... for my drive' or as in 'it's not automatically mounted on boot into a special directory'?
2007-03-16T07:24:00.000Z	reborn	derelm	i cant see it as in theres no /dev/hdb
2007-03-16T07:24:00.000Z	derelm	reborn	and dmesg | grep hdb isn't helpful either?
2007-03-16T07:25:00.000Z	reborn	derelm	to be honest im sort of new to linux so i didnt know athts actualy existed and honestly o dont know what it does...
2007-03-16T07:27:00.000Z	derelm	reborn	'dmesg | grep hdb' at a console run as root will output everything concerning hdb during startup of ubuntu. you'll probably need to run it with sudo : sudo dmesg | grep hdb
2007-03-16T07:28:00.000Z	reborn	derelm	thx ill try it... if it dosent work ill be back.. im on my mates pc... thx alot...
2007-03-16T07:28:00.000Z	derelm	reborn	there might be a hint on why hdb doesn't work, fingers crossed
2007-03-16T07:29:00.000Z	reborn	derelm	ill be back soon .. realy thanx alot man
