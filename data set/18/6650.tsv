2008-05-05T02:09:00.000Z	gerardoj		Does anybody knows what could be the worst thing that can happen if my filesystem is SEVERE damaged?
2008-05-05T02:10:00.000Z	gerardoj		how about hardware? nothing bad will happen to the hardware like HD?
2008-05-05T02:12:00.000Z	gerardoj		but basically it just happen at the software level right?
2008-05-05T02:14:00.000Z	gerardoj		cause I mistakenly ran e2fsck and then I restarted and I got something like 'e2fsck: found some errors on the filesystem'
2008-05-05T02:14:00.000Z	gerardoj		is it too bad? should I reinstall ubuntu again?
2008-05-05T02:15:00.000Z	soundray	gerardoj	do you have a live CD?
2008-05-05T02:15:00.000Z	gerardoj	soundray	you mean if Im running it on a LiveCD?
2008-05-05T02:15:00.000Z	soundray	gerardoj	no, I mean, do you have one at hand?
2008-05-05T02:16:00.000Z	gerardoj	soundray	yep
2008-05-05T02:16:00.000Z	soundray	gerardoj	I suggest you boot from it, then run 'sudo e2fsck -y /dev/sda9' (replacing your device name of course). After that, it should boot normally from HD.
2008-05-05T02:29:00.000Z	gerardoj	soundray	I did a 'sudo e2fsck -y /dev/sda3' and I got '/dev/sda3: clean 116815/7192576 files....'
2008-05-05T02:29:00.000Z	gerardoj	soundray	is that cool?
2008-05-05T02:29:00.000Z	soundray	gerardoj	yes, but I don't think you've fixed the problem. Was the failure on a different filesystem, perhaps?
2008-05-05T02:31:00.000Z	gerardoj	soundray	so far I remeber I did mistakenly the e2fsck on the /dev/sda3, so I think thats the one it should had the problems
2008-05-05T02:31:00.000Z	soundray	gerardoj	okay, let's see what happens when you reboot from HD
2008-05-05T02:37:00.000Z	gerardoj	soundray	alrighty I think everything seem to be working fine
2008-05-05T02:38:00.000Z	gerardoj	soundray	thanks
2008-05-05T02:38:00.000Z	gerardoj	soundray	appreciate it
