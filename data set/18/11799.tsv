2008-06-16T18:05:00.000Z	mitchell		bump, anyone? > since a few days my server's network input speed dropped to <1mbit, output is on 120mbit (checked with iperf) so i think its fine but limited by the input. all 3 nics have the same problem, they are connected to a gigabit switch. anyone knows what might be causing this?
2008-06-16T18:06:00.000Z	v0lksman	mitchell	check speed and duplex settings either with mii-tool or ethtool
2008-06-16T18:08:00.000Z	mitchell	v0lksman	i think it has something to do with kernel settings, cuz 3 nics are all limited to about 1mbit input, output is still 120mbit iperf says :P
2008-06-16T18:08:00.000Z	v0lksman	mitchell	you can check your sysctl to see if anything looks out of place there...especially if you use iptables
2008-06-16T18:09:00.000Z	mitchell	v0lksman	ok, ill try, havent used it before but ill m
2008-06-16T18:10:00.000Z	mitchell	v0lksman	> read something about it, but i can't understand it happened suddenly without changing anything xD
2008-06-16T18:13:00.000Z	v0lksman	mitchell	yeah...I'm not really sure if kernel updates change those settings...I think they can..however I'm not 100% sure they do....I know you can set window sizes and max packets etc...
2008-06-16T18:14:00.000Z	v0lksman	mitchell	you've tried simplifying the network to try to eliminate external factors?
2008-06-16T18:14:00.000Z	mitchell	v0lksman	yea, its just connected to a switch with the server and my notebook
2008-06-16T18:17:00.000Z	v0lksman	mitchell	are you running autonegotiate or hard coded?
2008-06-16T18:17:00.000Z	mitchell	v0lksman	its on auto neg atm
2008-06-16T18:17:00.000Z	v0lksman	mitchell	 hrm...is the switch programmable?
2008-06-16T18:18:00.000Z	v0lksman	mitchell	what kind of cards?
2008-06-16T18:18:00.000Z	v0lksman	mitchell	and this worked fine before the kernel update?
2008-06-16T18:19:00.000Z	mitchell	v0lksman	2x e1000 and a onboard broadcom, it suddenly started happening
2008-06-16T18:20:00.000Z	mitchell	v0lksman	i noticed my smb shares were VERY slow, so i checked and saw the server input was max 1Mbit/s
2008-06-16T18:21:00.000Z	v0lksman	mitchell	yeah that's weird...normally you'd see something with speed or duplex settings...I've had little issues with e1000s at gigE...however cables and switches make a BIG difference
