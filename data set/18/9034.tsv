2007-10-26T04:40:00.000Z	cellofellow	hyper__ch	hey there.
2007-10-26T04:40:00.000Z	hyper__ch	cellofellow	IMAP?
2007-10-26T04:41:00.000Z	cellofellow	hyper__ch	no, something like the way google desktop works. ;)
2007-10-26T04:41:00.000Z	hyper__ch	cellofellow	just thought you may not know that gmail now also support imap
2007-10-26T04:43:00.000Z	cellofellow	hyper__ch	IMPA vs. POP: what's it do?
2007-10-26T04:44:00.000Z	hyper__ch	cellofellow	with IMAP the mails stay on the server... with POP3 you download them to your computer
2007-10-26T04:44:00.000Z	hyper__ch	cellofellow	but with imap you can also read them in your mail client
2007-10-26T04:45:00.000Z	hyper__ch	cellofellow	where don't you see imap setting?
2007-10-26T04:46:00.000Z	cellofellow	hyper__ch	in the GMail settings.
2007-10-26T04:46:00.000Z	hyper__ch	cellofellow	you have to specify that in your email client ;)
2007-10-26T04:46:00.000Z	cellofellow	hyper__ch	so, if POP is enabled, so is IMAP?
2007-10-26T04:47:00.000Z	hyper__ch	cellofellow	no, imap does not depend on pop or vice versa.. they are different protocols
2007-10-26T04:47:00.000Z	cellofellow	hyper__ch	I know that, but there isn't an option (I can see) to enable IMAP in GMail so that I can download it to Evolution using IMAP.
2007-10-26T04:48:00.000Z	hyper__ch	cellofellow	you have to setup imap in your evolution account
2007-10-26T04:49:00.000Z	hyper__ch	cellofellow	in evolution you change pop3 to IMAP - don't ask me where... maybe you have to re-create the account with imap
2007-10-26T04:49:00.000Z	cellofellow	hyper__ch	I understand what you are saying, but I'm not sure if it'll work...
2007-10-26T04:49:00.000Z	hyper__ch	cellofellow	create another gmail account and test that for a little while :=
