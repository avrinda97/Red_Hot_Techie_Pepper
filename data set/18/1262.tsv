2011-04-26T09:15:00.000Z	LAcan	hanasaki	jumpline.com... theres a coupon for a free year, otherwise u can get it fro 2.95$ a month if you go halfway thru the signup then back out (its $3.50 a month otherwise)... the hosts ping the fastest for me of any cheap host

2011-04-26T09:18:00.000Z	LAcan	hanasaki	they dont ping as well for me.. just test it from the console and see what kinda response rate u get
