2007-01-23T06:13:00.000Z	sam_		ok what do i do to reset them when linux shuts down ?
2007-01-23T06:13:00.000Z	sam_		there is not some kind of command ?
2007-01-23T06:14:00.000Z	sam_		if the machine is rebooted to windows it locks up
2007-01-23T06:14:00.000Z	sam_		it doesn't do that if it's rebooted from windows to windows or to linux
2007-01-23T06:15:00.000Z	sam_		it doesn't lock up on cold starts
2007-01-23T06:15:00.000Z	sjoerd	sam_	that just means windows doesn't cope with the state of the hardware that linux apparently leaves it in.. There is nothing you can do about that
2007-01-23T06:15:00.000Z	sam_		but every time it's rebooted from linux to windows it hangs
2007-01-23T06:15:00.000Z	sam_	sjoerd	that's not acceptable
2007-01-23T06:16:00.000Z	sjoerd	sam_	then ask Microsoft to fix their drivers
2007-01-23T06:16:00.000Z	sam_		if it was a ms problem i would
2007-01-23T06:16:00.000Z	sam_		it's linux leaving the machine in a "dirty" state.
2007-01-23T06:18:00.000Z	sam_		what must be done to fix linux so that it doesn't do this ?
2007-01-23T06:18:00.000Z	sjoerd	sam_	why do you think it leaves your hw dirty ?
2007-01-23T06:19:00.000Z	sjoerd		The windows drivers should be able to initialize the hw correctly regardless of the state their in, if they can't it's their problem
2007-01-23T06:19:00.000Z	sam_		because i don't believe that it's dirty on cold start sjoerd ?
2007-01-23T06:20:00.000Z	sam_	sjoerd	no. it's my problem.  and i'd like to fix it.
2007-01-23T06:20:00.000Z	sjoerd	sam_	with a cold start the state might be different then what whatever operating systems leaves it in when you do a hot restart
2007-01-23T06:20:00.000Z	sjoerd	sam_	you can't unless you fix your windows
