2007-01-29T13:23:00.000Z	clayg		anyone know a better way to fix /restore myself from a failed beryl install  back to the "normal" way. other than hunting the net and begging someon for theirs?
2007-01-29T13:23:00.000Z	clayg		or installing it on another box just to get the defualt xorg.conf?
2007-01-29T13:23:00.000Z	clayg		er x11.conf one of 'em
2007-01-29T13:25:00.000Z	clayg		on crossover? i want something free or cheap at least
2007-01-29T13:25:00.000Z	clayg		isn't cedega codeweavers also?
2007-01-29T13:25:00.000Z	clayg		i might buy it (i know right, buy>?!) if i can play wow on it
2007-01-29T13:25:00.000Z	clayg		i have nvidia
2007-01-29T13:25:00.000Z	clayg		no kidding huh
2007-01-29T13:26:00.000Z	clayg		which is te best outta the 3? wine seems to never work for me
2007-01-29T13:26:00.000Z	clayg		is cedage better than codeweavers/xover? how much os codeweavers?
2007-01-29T13:28:00.000Z	zbogdan	clayg	try setting up wine yourself, not that hard
2007-01-29T13:28:00.000Z	clayg	zbogdan	i did hard to explain atm though
2007-01-29T13:28:00.000Z	clayg		well if photo shop isn't 3d then wow isn't ut then again who decides when  a 2d object is considered 3d anyhow
2007-01-29T13:29:00.000Z	zbogdan	clayg	rephrase atm
2007-01-29T13:29:00.000Z	clayg		at the moment
2007-01-29T13:29:00.000Z	clayg		in other words in stead of explaining why i ont want to know /use wine, i rather move on to the answer to the quest i asked, a nice way of saying that
2007-01-29T13:30:00.000Z	clayg		gotcha
2007-01-29T13:30:00.000Z	zbogdan	clayg	i belive cedega is focused on games only, crossover is more general - supports less games and more big office packages (MSIE, office)
