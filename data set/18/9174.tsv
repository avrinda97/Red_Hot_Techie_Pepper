2009-02-07T22:14:00.000Z	blahblahx		hey guys. i want to have wbar autostart so i made a .desktop file for it and put it in /etc/xdg/autostart. however, since it uses fake transparency, it adapts to the black background that shows up before my wallpaper, not my actual wallpaper. is there any way to change this, like have it not start for a few seconds?
2009-02-07T22:15:00.000Z	usser	blahblahx	its a known issues, wbar loads before wallpaper is set use -sleep N option in wbar to set the timeout
2009-02-07T22:15:00.000Z	blahblahx	usser	how do i set timeout?
2009-02-07T22:16:00.000Z	blahblahx	usser	oh nevermind
2009-02-07T22:16:00.000Z	blahblahx	usser	i get it.
2009-02-07T22:16:00.000Z	usser	blahblahx	run wbar with wbar -sleep or wbar -wait i dont remember which
2009-02-07T22:24:00.000Z	blahblahx	usser	ah. the sleep command is used in your desktop, not in wbar.
2009-02-07T22:17:00.000Z	blahblahx	usser	wait, there is no sleep parameter for wbar.
2009-02-07T22:18:00.000Z	usser	blahblahx	there was something like this, hang on let me power my eeepc
2009-02-07T22:22:00.000Z	blahblahx	usser	hows it coming along?
2009-02-07T22:22:00.000Z	usser	blahblahx	hm, cant find it, i'm pretty sure there was something like that in wbar options
2009-02-07T22:23:00.000Z	blahblahx	usser	i just took a look through, no sucess. let me google it
2009-02-07T22:24:00.000Z	usser	blahblahx	meanwhile try running it with -above-desktop
2009-02-07T22:24:00.000Z	blahblahx	usser	unfortunately, i run lxde which i am not sure has an autostart file.
2009-02-07T22:25:00.000Z	usser	blahblahx	According to wbar's author, wbar might try to show itself before the desktop is ready. If the bar comes up looking weird (with window decorations, for example), try adding a short wait, such as sleep 5, just prior to the wbar command in your file.
2009-02-07T22:25:00.000Z	usser	blahblahx	there you go, lxde uses openbox the autostart file is in /etc/xdg/openbox/autostart.sh
2009-02-07T22:25:00.000Z	blahblahx	usser	right i tried adding wbar to it to no avail, i just found out lxde has its own.
2009-02-07T22:27:00.000Z	usser	blahblahx	really? you can try putting it in ~/.xinitrc
