2010-01-20T04:13:00.000Z	Topy44		hm, i have a solitary white pixel on my panel which acts like an applet (as in, it gets moved along when moving around applets), but cant be removed or moved by its own
2010-01-20T04:13:00.000Z	Topy44		any ideas?
2010-01-20T04:13:00.000Z	Topy44		its there in a standard UNR installation
2010-01-20T04:15:00.000Z	Topy44		hm, i just realized:
2010-01-20T04:15:00.000Z	Topy44		that white pixel is there for everybody it seems, as i can find it on screenshots on the net

2010-01-20T04:16:00.000Z	Topy44		kyle: but its not part of the clock. when you move the clock around or remove the clock from the panel the pixel is still there
2010-01-20T04:18:00.000Z	Topy44		kyle: i love the tabbed browsing and icon-only switcher, i kinda like the launcher but its buggy as hell, and i just wish they would get their act together
2010-01-20T04:18:00.000Z	triple_xxx	Topy44	there are some good netbook remixes ,but what netbook do you own???
2010-01-20T04:18:00.000Z	Topy44	triple_xxx	first generation eee pc, so 701/4g
2010-01-20T04:19:00.000Z	Topy44		and before anyone recommends using eeebuntu or easypeasy or whatever... there is absolutely no reason to use those instead of regular UNR imho
2010-01-20T04:19:00.000Z	Topy44		as all the bugs and annoyances are present
2010-01-20T04:20:00.000Z	triple_xxx	Topy44	then asus eee pc Easy Peasy was built for that and jolicloud also claims to be working on most netbooks right out the box
2010-01-20T04:20:00.000Z	Topy44		i did manage to change the most annoying thing about the unr launcher, which is the ridiculously high icon distance
2010-01-20T04:20:00.000Z	triple_xxx	Topy44	depends on screen size also you can get ubuntu with moblin
2010-01-20T04:21:00.000Z	Topy44		yeah, no major surgery to get mine to work either, most things work fine ootb
2010-01-20T04:21:00.000Z	Topy44		its all just customizing stuff - the main reason i like UNR is because the screen is TINY (6.4" 800x480) and the touchpad is useless
2010-01-20T04:22:00.000Z	triple_xxx	Topy44	if its screen resolution Moblin would be the way to go
