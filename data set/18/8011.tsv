2007-10-14T07:13:00.000Z	axjv		Akrill: What drivers are you using
2007-10-14T07:14:00.000Z	akrill	axjv	ndiswrapper to wrap the 64-bit drivers from HP
2007-10-14T07:15:00.000Z	axjv	akrill	If that doesn't work, you can try to use the 1.49rc3 version of ndiswrapper
2007-10-14T07:15:00.000Z	axjv	akrill	The version in repository is old.
2007-10-14T07:15:00.000Z	akrill	axjv	im running gutsy at the moment, but this problem was the same in feisty so its not gutsy specific
2007-10-14T07:16:00.000Z	akrill	axjv	and i compiled ndiswrapper from source anyway
2007-10-14T07:25:00.000Z	akrill	axjv	where that firmware you spoke of?
2007-10-14T07:25:00.000Z	axjv	akrill	I think that other user offered to send it to you?
2007-10-14T07:26:00.000Z	axjv	akrill	If not, you can always use the dell drivers in ndiswarpper. They always work fast for me.
2007-10-14T07:26:00.000Z	akrill	axjv	ya, that would probably work better considering im actually ON a dell. (D620)
2007-10-14T07:27:00.000Z	axjv	akrill	I can send you just some essential files
2007-10-14T07:27:00.000Z	axjv	akrill	Do you have an AIM or MSN?
2007-10-14T07:27:00.000Z	akrill	axjv	that would be wonderful! yes i do. my aim is corpor3al
2007-10-14T07:28:00.000Z	axjv	akrill	Hold on, just quickly downloading the files.
2007-10-14T07:29:00.000Z	akrill	axjv	okiedoke.
2007-10-14T07:32:00.000Z	axjv	akrill	What's the model of your wireless card?
2007-10-14T07:33:00.000Z	akrill	axjv	Broadcom Corporation BCM94311MCG wlan mini-PCI (rev -01)
