2009-10-13T06:17:00.000Z	Shawn-		SO a proxy server is something that is used to bypass firewalls etc to view webpages... Is there anyway to set up my Home computer (using Ubuntu) as a Proxy server so I can access restricted pages from my laptop (also on Ubuntu)
2009-10-13T06:18:00.000Z	InitHello	Shawn-	easiest way would probably be to run privoxy on your home computer
2009-10-13T06:19:00.000Z	Shawn-	InitHello	Would my home computer have to be dedicated to doing this?
2009-10-13T06:19:00.000Z	InitHello	Shawn-	nah, privoxy doesn't take much resources
2009-10-13T06:19:00.000Z	Shawn-	InitHello	Is it difficult to set up?
2009-10-13T06:19:00.000Z	InitHello	Shawn-	it worked out of the box for me, if memory serves
2009-10-13T06:19:00.000Z	Shawn-	InitHello	Is it in the repos?
2009-10-13T06:20:00.000Z	InitHello	Shawn-	yes, I believe the package name is privoxy
2009-10-13T06:20:00.000Z	Shawn-	InitHello	and this will let me bypass their web restrictions right?
2009-10-13T06:20:00.000Z	InitHello	Shawn-	assuming they haven't blocked outgoing connections to for example port 8888, yes
2009-10-13T06:22:00.000Z	Shawn-	InitHello	Where does privoxy install by default I cant figure out where to open it xD
2009-10-13T06:23:00.000Z	InitHello	Shawn-	it runs as a daemon at system startup, by default
2009-10-13T06:23:00.000Z	Shawn-		InitHello.... Oh so that means its running now that its installed... Great but now how do I set up my laptop to use it? xD
2009-10-13T06:23:00.000Z	InitHello	Shawn-	ooh ... do you have a static IP at home?
2009-10-13T06:24:00.000Z	Shawn-	InitHello	I think I need to set one up still... I had one before I reinstalled Ubuntu
2009-10-13T06:25:00.000Z	InitHello	Shawn-	well, static IPs and/or dyndns services are beyond the scope of this channel, but what you want to do is tell your browser to use your home IP and port (search /etc/privoxy/config for 'listen-address' to find the port) as a proxy
2009-10-13T06:26:00.000Z	Shawn-	InitHello	you cant help me do it in a Private chat?
2009-10-13T06:26:00.000Z	InitHello	Shawn-	sure
