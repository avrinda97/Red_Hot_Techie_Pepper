2006-03-04T13:52:00.000Z	Rob_Dude		Wow.  I'm impressed.  I just plugged my digital camera into my computer...and I got a pop-up window asking me if I wanted to import my digital media
2006-03-04T13:52:00.000Z	Rob_Dude		Man, it can't get any easier than that.
2006-03-04T13:53:00.000Z	Rob_Dude		I wonder if Linux can handle my MP3 player....
2006-03-04T13:55:00.000Z	Rob_Dude		So, um, I realise that just by needing to ask this question; I'm grossly underqualified to really understand the response...but I've done lots of programming with .Net and some C++, but never anything other than boring desktop apps.  What does it take to write a hardware driver for Linux?
2006-03-04T13:57:00.000Z	mustard5	Rob_Dude	seems its more complex than anyone here knows :)
2006-03-07T13:54:00.000Z	mustard5	Rob_Dude	I really dont' know...whats the answer?
2006-03-07T13:54:00.000Z	mustard5	Rob_Dude	what have you done so far to configure your system for playing movies?
2006-03-07T13:56:00.000Z	mustard5	Rob_Dude	what would these packages be called in the error messages?
2006-03-07T13:57:00.000Z	mustard5	Rob_Dude	what about if you start from scratch and follow a guide and tell me what each error message is at it occurs?
2006-03-07T13:58:00.000Z	mustard5	Rob_Dude	k..did you download w32codecs from the link on the Restrited Formats wiki page?
2006-03-07T13:59:00.000Z	mustard5	Rob_Dude	k...so you then installed them using the dpkg command?
2006-03-07T13:59:00.000Z	mustard5	Rob_Dude	k
2006-03-07T13:59:00.000Z	mustard5	Rob_Dude	what format are the movies that don't play?
2006-03-07T14:01:00.000Z	mustard5	Rob_Dude	are they .wmv files?
2006-03-07T14:02:00.000Z	mustard5	Rob_Dude	are you on 64 bit kernel?
2006-03-07T14:02:00.000Z	mustard5	Rob_Dude	k
2006-03-07T14:02:00.000Z	mustard5	Rob_Dude	I have heard of problems with .wmv files...I don't know the details though
2006-03-07T14:03:00.000Z	mustard5	Rob_Dude	well thats probably a good way to go about it.
