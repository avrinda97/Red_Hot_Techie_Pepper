2006-05-27T13:24:00.000Z	dooglus	oven	su to root and do: "apt-get --reinistall sudo"  that should fix it
2006-05-27T13:07:00.000Z	dooglus	oven	I don't think it's been 'adm' since hoary
2006-05-27T13:08:00.000Z	oven	dooglus	strange
2006-05-27T13:09:00.000Z	dooglus	oven	can you read the contents of /etc/sudoers ?
2006-05-27T13:09:00.000Z	oven	dooglus	no, not as my user
2006-05-27T13:09:00.000Z	dooglus	oven	did you set a root password?
2006-05-27T13:09:00.000Z	oven	dooglus	yes
2006-05-27T13:10:00.000Z	oven	dooglus	and I can su to root
2006-05-27T13:10:00.000Z	dooglus	oven	it's a group, and you could, but you need to be root to do it
2006-05-27T13:11:00.000Z	oven	dooglus	ok, no problem. What gid should I use? Just the first available?
2006-05-27T13:12:00.000Z	oven	dooglus	there are no lines starting with %
2006-05-27T13:12:00.000Z	dooglus	oven	odd
2006-05-27T13:14:00.000Z	dooglus	oven	it sounds like the install didn't complete properly.
2006-05-27T13:24:00.000Z	dooglus	oven	su to root and do: "apt-get --reinistall install sudo"  that should fix it
2006-05-27T13:26:00.000Z	oven	dooglus	nope, that didn't help. It also didn't add an 'admin' group
2006-05-27T13:26:00.000Z	oven	dooglus	and it didn't touch /etc/sudoers
2006-05-27T13:26:00.000Z	dooglus	oven	I wouldn't recommend running "passwd -l root" - it will lock the root account, and then you'll not be able to fix anything without booting into rescue mode
2006-05-27T13:27:00.000Z	oven	dooglus	I won't do that, then :)
