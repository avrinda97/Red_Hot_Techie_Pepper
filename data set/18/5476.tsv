2008-10-17T16:30:00.000Z	xarvh		no
2008-10-17T16:31:00.000Z	fr0d0barkins	xarvh	u can plug a USB ethernet adapter
2008-10-17T16:32:00.000Z	fr0d0barkins	xarvh	just like what ikonia thought
2008-10-17T16:32:00.000Z	fr0d0barkins		lol
2008-10-17T16:33:00.000Z	xarvh	fr0d0barkins	wouldn't that be simpler with just a usb cable between the two machines?
2008-10-17T16:33:00.000Z	fr0d0barkins	xarvh	simple by look, but dunno d config
2008-10-17T16:35:00.000Z	xarvh	fr0d0barkins	well, yes... I've been searching around and seems that only windows is capable of this... pity, it seemed kinda obvious =(
2008-10-17T16:35:00.000Z	fr0d0barkins	xarvh	i'll search too. there must be a way
2008-10-17T16:35:00.000Z	xarvh	fr0d0barkins	thanks! =)
2008-10-17T16:36:00.000Z	fr0d0barkins		but xarvh, the USB ethernet plug is sized as a USB drive too. simple.
2008-10-17T16:39:00.000Z	xarvh	fr0d0barkins	Yes, I see... It just seems stupid to use new hardware (and buy it, and have it messing around) to overcome a software problem.... Thanks anyway.
2008-10-17T16:43:00.000Z	fr0d0barkins	xarvh	i think the cable is different, not like usual usb cable
2008-10-17T16:45:00.000Z	xarvh	fr0d0barkins	indeed, it should be some sort of inverted usb cable. but if i don't have the software for using it, there's no point in buying it
2008-10-17T16:46:00.000Z	fr0d0barkins	xarvh	no, there is a chip in the middle
2008-10-17T16:46:00.000Z	fr0d0barkins	xarvh	http://www.hardwaresecrets.com/article/248
2008-10-17T16:47:00.000Z	fr0d0barkins	xarvh	means u have to buy something to get your boxes connected lol
2008-10-17T16:48:00.000Z	xarvh	fr0d0barkins	ouch!! ahah, seems like i have no chances then! ok, thank you very much!
2008-10-17T16:49:00.000Z	fr0d0barkins	xarvh	:-h
