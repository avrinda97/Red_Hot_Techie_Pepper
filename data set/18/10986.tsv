2006-10-04T07:02:00.000Z	boink	whitedeth	do you want to set the time correctly on your PC?
2006-10-04T07:02:00.000Z	whitedeth	boink	Yes
2006-10-04T07:07:00.000Z	boink	whitedeth	it just gives yuor system the proper time
2006-10-04T07:08:00.000Z	whitedeth	boink	And how is one to force the system to use that time as the correct time?
2006-10-04T07:09:00.000Z	whitedeth	boink	Fine with me, but how do I do it? It still says 1:09PM in the tray while it's actually 2:04 AM.
2006-10-04T07:11:00.000Z	whitedeth	boink	Why is the tray showing it wrong? :\
2006-10-04T07:12:00.000Z	boink	whitedeth	heh, then it could be something in gnome.
