2007-01-07T11:00:00.000Z	serishema		for some reason after a crash, apt-get just goes back to the prompt without displaying anything when i try to install anything

2007-01-07T11:03:00.000Z	castoff	serishema	sorry stumped me
2007-01-07T11:39:00.000Z	castoff	serishema	you need the Xlibraries
2007-01-07T11:39:00.000Z	serishema	castoff	i have those
2007-01-07T11:40:00.000Z	serishema	castoff	i just don't want kdm trying to start X org since that will make it crash
2007-01-07T11:40:00.000Z	castoff	serishema	don't ask me what package that is in Ubuntu never looked
2007-01-07T11:41:00.000Z	castoff	serishema	use sysv-rc-conf to turn off kdm so it won't start
2007-01-07T11:42:00.000Z	serishema	castoff	i want kdm to run though to manage remote x terminals
2007-01-07T11:42:00.000Z	castoff	serishema	if you don't have that install it, i like it alot
2007-01-07T11:43:00.000Z	castoff	serishema	does it need to? i've never done that always pulled the GUI's back through ssh
2007-01-07T11:43:00.000Z	serishema	castoff	it would be easier if my linux ignorant brother just saw a login window on the right box
2007-01-07T11:43:00.000Z	castoff	serishema	hehe ok
