2007-11-19T23:28:00.000Z	Patchak		hey all, is there any good alternative to gftp, every time I use it it ust crashes....
2007-11-19T23:28:00.000Z	Patchak		I would like something with a GUI andthat does ssh as well
2007-11-19T23:29:00.000Z	sandaru1	Patchak	filezilla
2007-11-19T23:29:00.000Z	Patchak	sandaru1	does filezilla tranfer in ssh ??
2007-11-19T23:29:00.000Z	sandaru1	Patchak	yes
2007-11-19T23:35:00.000Z	sandaru1	Patchak	the best way to check why program crashes is to run the program within the terminal.. go to terminal and type "gftp".. then if you are lucky you'll see some error messages
2007-11-19T23:42:00.000Z	sandaru1	Patchak	did you try running it from terminal and checked for any error messages?
2007-11-19T23:43:00.000Z	Patchak	sandaru1	no, just with the visual thing... I'm a new user just passed from win...
2007-11-19T23:44:00.000Z	sandaru1	Patchak	Applications -> Accessories -> Terminal.. then, type "gtfp".. then, paste the output to pastebin (if there is any output)
2007-11-19T23:46:00.000Z	Patchak	sandaru1	hummm no error
2007-11-19T23:46:00.000Z	sandaru1	Patchak	it just crashes.. nothing in the terminal?
2007-11-19T23:47:00.000Z	Patchak	sandaru1	Is that what I need to do?? Try and use it while the terminal window is opened???
2007-11-19T23:48:00.000Z	sandaru1	Patchak	you have to type "gftp" in the command line.. then you'll see the gui.. play around it.. when it crashes, if you are lucky.. you'll see some error messages
2007-11-19T23:49:00.000Z	sandaru1	Patchak	error messages in the terminal window
2007-11-19T23:49:00.000Z	Patchak	sandaru1	: ok I typed gftp and nothing happened
2007-11-19T23:49:00.000Z	sandaru1	Patchak	gtfp is running?
2007-11-19T23:49:00.000Z	Patchak	sandaru1	ok I'll try that and tell ya if I get any errors
2007-11-19T23:49:00.000Z	Patchak	sandaru1	yeah now it is
