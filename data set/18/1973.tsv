2011-06-01T15:36:00.000Z	Egbert9e9		sometimes i get these kind of messages: 13:11 -!- Irssi: Couldn't create log file /home/phunbaba/irclogs/FreeNode/zaapiel.log: No  such file or  directory
2011-06-01T15:36:00.000Z	Egbert9e9		it's on a remote irssi i log into with ssh
2011-06-01T15:36:00.000Z	Egbert9e9		and it happens with screen/tmux/dtach
2011-06-01T15:36:00.000Z	linux_hacks	Egbert9e9	probably the location where you pointed logs to store.. doesn't have FreeNode directory I think
2011-06-01T15:37:00.000Z	Egbert9e9	linux_hacks	there is a FreeNode dir
2011-06-01T15:37:00.000Z	Egbert9e9	linux_hacks	everything already exists
2011-06-01T15:38:00.000Z	linux_hacks	Egbert9e9	check the file permissions
2011-06-01T15:40:00.000Z	linux_hacks	Egbert9e9	what are the permissions on files
2011-06-01T15:41:00.000Z	Egbert9e9	linux_hacks	directories are rwx------ and files are rw-------
2011-06-01T15:44:00.000Z	linux_hacks	Egbert9e9	do this ls -la|fpaste
2011-06-01T15:45:00.000Z	linux_hacks	Egbert9e9	sudo apt-get install pastebinit
2011-06-01T15:45:00.000Z	linux_hacks	Egbert9e9	then ls -la|pastebinit
2011-06-01T15:46:00.000Z	Egbert9e9	linux_hacks	all directories are drwx------ all files are -rwx------ and they all belong to phunbaba:phunbaba who runs the processes
2011-06-01T15:48:00.000Z	linux_hacks	Egbert9e9	looking at the structure.. only root has permissions.. where as phunbaba doesn't have permissions
2011-06-01T15:48:00.000Z	Egbert9e9	linux_hacks	what do you mean?
2011-06-01T15:48:00.000Z	linux_hacks	Egbert9e9	permissions by which the program ran, doesn't have priviliges to edit/touch the file
2011-06-01T15:51:00.000Z	Egbert9e9	linux_hacks	but the process belongs to phunbaba
2011-06-01T15:51:00.000Z	linux_hacks	Egbert9e9	then no idea... couldn't help you much
