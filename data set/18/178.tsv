2012-07-02T19:50:00.000Z	burg		hello. for some reason my ubuntu server can`t solve dns anymore
2012-07-02T19:51:00.000Z	burg		other computers from the same network don`t have this problem
2012-07-02T19:52:00.000Z	Gentoorax	burg	can you still ping other machines?
2012-07-02T19:53:00.000Z	burg	Gentoorax	only if i type the ip directly
2012-07-02T19:53:00.000Z	Gentoorax	burg	OK, compare your /etc/resolv.conf
2012-07-02T19:53:00.000Z	Gentoorax	burg	with on of the working machines
2012-07-02T19:54:00.000Z	Gentoorax	burg	it should specify the nameserver
2012-07-02T19:54:00.000Z	Gentoorax	burg	if your not using any special nameserver, just try and stick the line nameserver 8.8.8.8 in the /etc/resolv.conf file
2012-07-02T19:54:00.000Z	Gentoorax	burg	it should work instantly once saved
2012-07-02T19:55:00.000Z	burg	Gentoorax	it is using: nameserver 192.168.0.1
2012-07-02T19:55:00.000Z	Gentoorax	burg	that looks like your router or gateway, which is not correct for a nameserver usually, try 8.8.8.8 which is the google dns server
2012-07-02T19:55:00.000Z	burg	Gentoorax	it works now, thank you
2012-07-02T19:56:00.000Z	Gentoorax	burg	no problem.
2012-07-02T19:57:00.000Z	Gentoorax	burg	You might want to check it sticks around after a reboot, ubuntu has tools these days which can automatically overwrite this file. I think there is a connection manager application manager somewhere that you can set this in, if it doesn't survive the reboot.
2012-07-02T19:58:00.000Z	burg	Gentoorax	do you know its name?
2012-07-02T20:00:00.000Z	Gentoorax	burg	No sorry, I mainly a gentoo guy, we do everything from the console :) if I remmeber correctly though, if you use the gnome desktop right click the connection icon top right and you can set it in there.
2012-07-02T20:01:00.000Z	burg	Gentoorax	i am using ubuntu server, no gui
2012-07-02T20:01:00.000Z	Gentoorax	burg	Oh, in that case, shouldn't have a problem
