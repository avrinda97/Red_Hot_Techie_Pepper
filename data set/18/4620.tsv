2010-03-13T20:24:00.000Z	michLinuxGuy		HP dv7-3183cl laptop with Nvidia G105M using Nvidia driver locks up after logging into display manager.  The animation thing starts, distorts, then freezes the machine (on Karmic)
2010-03-13T20:24:00.000Z	michLinuxGuy		HP dv7-3183cl laptop with Lucid alpha 3 doesn't recognize the wireless adapter.
2010-03-13T20:26:00.000Z	michLinuxGuy		I posted problem about Karmic too.  Man, you guys are cranky.
2010-03-13T20:28:00.000Z	acicula	michLinuxGuy	complaining will get you nowhere, everyone here is a volunteer, please remember that
2010-03-13T20:29:00.000Z	michLinuxGuy	acicula	It's not complaining.  It's constructive criticism.
2010-03-13T20:30:00.000Z	acicula	michLinuxGuy	this is a support channel
2010-03-13T20:38:00.000Z	acicula	michLinuxGuy	anything recent that is not a netbook
2010-03-13T20:39:00.000Z	michLinuxGuy	acicula	Thanks but I just bought this new HP and it is not working so well.
2010-03-13T20:40:00.000Z	acicula	michLinuxGuy	what graphics chip?
2010-03-13T20:40:00.000Z	michLinuxGuy	acicula	Nvidia G105M
2010-03-13T20:40:00.000Z	acicula	michLinuxGuy	did the default driver work?
2010-03-13T20:41:00.000Z	michLinuxGuy	acicula	Default driver worked, but I bought this 1000 dollar laptop for graphics performance.  I want the accelerated Nvidia driver.
2010-03-13T20:43:00.000Z	acicula	michLinuxGuy	well the 105M is a lot of things, but not performance, heh. activating the proposed nvidia driver caused problems then?
2010-03-13T20:44:00.000Z	michLinuxGuy	acicula	Please tell me exactly what laptop you would recommend then.
2010-03-13T20:49:00.000Z	acicula	michLinuxGuy	for graphics performance no laptop really is recommended tbh, unless you mean just some 3d effects, then any nvidia card will suffice
2010-03-13T20:49:00.000Z	acicula	michLinuxGuy	what went wrong with installing the nvidia binary driver, 105m isnt really new and should be well supported by nvidia by now
2010-03-13T20:50:00.000Z	michLinuxGuy	acicula	 For my job, I must use a laptop.  That is a constraint.  "any nvidia" will not suffice as I have demonstrated.
2010-03-13T20:52:00.000Z	acicula	michLinuxGuy	it works, just not the binary driver appearantly, but so far i dont know why
