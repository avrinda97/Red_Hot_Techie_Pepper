2005-02-05T16:06:00.000Z	jcoxon77		do you have a boot entry?
2005-02-05T16:06:00.000Z	jcoxon77		like "boot=/dev/sdb2
2005-02-05T16:06:00.000Z	jcoxon77		or something
2005-02-05T16:07:00.000Z	jcoxon77		i can... i installed ext2fsmanager : http://sourceforge.net/projects/ext2fsx/
2005-02-05T16:08:00.000Z	jcoxon77		however there is the question of if you can then run ybin to install the new config file!
2005-02-05T16:09:00.000Z	jcoxon77		perhaps you are going to need a live cd either the ubuntu one or perhaps knoppix and mount the drive and then chroot in and ybin
2005-02-05T16:09:00.000Z	jcoxon77		an*
2005-02-05T16:10:00.000Z	thoreauputic	jcoxon77	do you know the key combos on an iBook G4 with ubuntu to get a console and then login, or get back to X?
2005-02-05T16:11:00.000Z	thoreauputic	jcoxon77	ie ctrl-alt-F* equivalents?
2005-02-05T16:12:00.000Z	jcoxon77	thoreauputic	um not sure... i think tho if you kill x enough it will die and you can login but i haven't yet need to access the console that way
2005-02-05T16:12:00.000Z	jcoxon77	thoreauputic	why are you having problems with x?
2005-02-05T16:13:00.000Z	thoreauputic	jcoxon77	I'm not - I just like to use the consoles for things - I have 6 of them, after all ;)
2005-02-05T16:14:00.000Z	thoreauputic	jcoxon77	they must be accessible as they are listed in /etc/inittab
2005-02-05T16:14:00.000Z	jcoxon77	thoreauputic	yes but i can't manage to find them
2005-02-05T16:15:00.000Z	thoreauputic	jcoxon77	hmm - I can get a console, but it won't allow me to log in
2005-02-05T16:15:00.000Z	jcoxon77	thoreauputic	how?
2005-02-05T16:17:00.000Z	jcoxon77	thoreauputic	doesn't work for me...
2005-02-05T16:21:00.000Z	jcoxon77	thoreauputic	cool
