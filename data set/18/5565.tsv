2009-02-10T13:25:00.000Z	lorenzosu		Apparently the PC speaker iscalled "mono" and has its own fader... I hadn't enabled all the mixer views.
2009-02-10T13:25:00.000Z	DanaG	lorenzosu	is it one of the business workstations?
2009-02-10T13:25:00.000Z	DanaG		I seem to remember those having the Mono slider control internal speaker.
2009-02-10T13:25:00.000Z	lorenzosu	DanaG	Yes. After months I managed to convince my boss to install ubuntu on one of these machines.
2009-02-10T13:25:00.000Z	DanaG		go to gnome-terminal and do alsamixer -c0
2009-02-10T13:26:00.000Z	DanaG		0 as in zero.
2009-02-10T13:26:00.000Z	lorenzosu	DanaG	I solved it! :) The inbuilt PC speaker has its own fader in the mixer: it calls it "Mono"
2009-02-10T13:26:00.000Z	DanaG		the Cal Poly lab has some of those workstations, but with Fedora.
2009-02-10T13:27:00.000Z	lorenzosu		DnaG: Cal Poly?
2009-02-10T13:28:00.000Z	DanaG		California Polytechnic State University.
2009-02-10T13:28:00.000Z	DanaG		That's my college.
2009-02-10T13:29:00.000Z	lorenzosu	DanaG	Wow, cool. But I guess at uni it's easier.. In business environment with all the machines preinstalled with Windows XP an so forth. In fact installing Ubuntu on here maintaining the dual boot was a little of a nightmre.
2009-02-10T13:30:00.000Z	lorenzosu		This machine also had a fake raid with raid 0 - shrug :|
2009-02-10T13:30:00.000Z	DanaG		!botsnack
2009-02-10T13:31:00.000Z	DanaG		Raid 0 is a bad idea: you HALVE your reliability.
2009-02-10T13:31:00.000Z	DanaG		If one drive fails, you might as well have had both fail.
2009-02-10T13:31:00.000Z	lorenzosu	DanaG	I know... tell HP though ;)
2009-02-10T13:32:00.000Z	lorenzosu	DanaG	But in the end I managed to install with double boot and without having to reinstall windows.. made me feel so smart lol
