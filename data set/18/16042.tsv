2006-03-11T17:50:00.000Z	diogo		Ive just tried another mirror, but still no j2re1.4 available...
2006-03-11T17:50:00.000Z	Ng	diogo	the RestrictedFormats wiki page covers installing Sun's Java 1.5 which is a much better plan generally
2006-03-11T17:51:00.000Z	diogo	Ng	Ive tried that also, but theres also no 'java-package' available... :'(
2006-03-11T17:51:00.000Z	Ng	diogo	it's in multiverse
2006-03-11T17:52:00.000Z	Ng	diogo	it does say on the page to enable the other repositories :)
2006-03-11T17:53:00.000Z	diogo	Ng	I know, Ive uncommented every repository entry in my sources.list, but still no luck...
2006-03-11T17:54:00.000Z	Ng	diogo	and have you edited them to add multiverse?
2006-03-11T17:54:00.000Z	Ng	diogo	please read the addingrepositories page ubotu sent you, it really does explain how to do this
2006-03-11T17:56:00.000Z	diogo	Ng	I'll check that, thanks!
2006-03-11T06:05:00.000Z	Ng	diogo	you need to have multiverse enabled for each of the entries
2006-03-11T06:05:00.000Z	diogo	Ng	So I have to yank-yank and paste every repository entry and add "multiverse" in the end (more or less)?
2006-03-11T06:06:00.000Z	Ng	diogo	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/6047 just copy that
2006-03-11T06:09:00.000Z	diogo	Ng	I can't believe the sources.list from http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/6047 is NOT the default! :o)
2006-03-11T06:09:00.000Z	diogo	Ng	Despite the typographical error in "pacakges", of course! ;o)
2006-03-11T06:09:00.000Z	Ng	diogo	there are reasons, unfortunately
2006-03-11T06:10:00.000Z	diogo	Ng	Got it! ;o)
2006-03-11T06:12:00.000Z	diogo	Ng	Just one more question... To turn breezy into dapper all I need is to replace 'breezy' with 'dapper' in sources.list, right?
2006-03-11T06:12:00.000Z	Ng	diogo	yep
