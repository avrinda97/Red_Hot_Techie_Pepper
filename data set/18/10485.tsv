2007-11-30T18:05:00.000Z	echosystm		guys, i am worried there is something wrong with my computer
2007-11-30T18:05:00.000Z	echosystm		windows xp/2000 works fine
2007-11-30T18:05:00.000Z	echosystm		no problems whatsoever, but all linux oses spew out acpi errors at me on bootup. also the dsl live cd wont even run.
2007-11-30T18:05:00.000Z	echosystm		i dont know what to do
2007-11-30T18:06:00.000Z	echosystm		if anyone has any advice, that would be good
2007-11-30T18:06:00.000Z	echosystm		also, using ubuntu, my computer runs horribly
2007-11-30T18:06:00.000Z	echosystm		far slower than windows xp
2007-11-30T18:06:00.000Z	echosystm		firefox can max out my cpu after a few tabs
2007-11-30T18:07:00.000Z	MasterShrek	echosystm	boot with the noacpi kernel option?
2007-11-30T18:19:00.000Z	MasterShrek	echosystm	fluxbuntu, ubuntu, xubuntu, kubuntu, etc all have the same kernel afaik, the hardware shold be supported the same, no matter what desktop environment you are using
2007-11-30T18:20:00.000Z	MasterShrek	echosystm	it depends, but i would just disable acpi
2007-11-30T18:22:00.000Z	MasterShrek	echosystm	/var/log/syslog
2007-12-06T10:23:00.000Z	MasterShrek	echosystm	depends on the program
2007-12-06T10:23:00.000Z	MasterShrek	echosystm	if you are looking for one: whereis <program>
2007-12-06T10:23:00.000Z	MasterShrek	echosystm	/opt is a good place for things you compile
2007-12-06T10:32:00.000Z	MasterShrek	echosystm	what kinda gfx card? do you have drivers installed for it?
2007-12-06T10:33:00.000Z	MasterShrek	echosystm	how did you install the driver?
2007-12-06T10:34:00.000Z	MasterShrek	echosystm	maybe try using the driver from nvidia's site
