2007-04-12T07:56:00.000Z	Mikey		hello guys, im havving a difficulty finding alt CD on the web site, can anyone help? (im looking for the command line only install, as in no X)
2007-04-12T07:58:00.000Z	Mikey		but sudo means super user do
2007-04-12T07:58:00.000Z	atoponce	Mikey	nope. switch user and do
2007-04-12T07:58:00.000Z	atoponce	Mikey	you can switch as other users on the system, not just root
2007-04-12T07:59:00.000Z	atoponce	Mikey	su and sudo by default use root. you can uso *any* other user on the system
2007-04-12T07:59:00.000Z	atoponce	Mikey	yes
2007-04-12T07:59:00.000Z	atoponce	Mikey	you want the server cd
2007-04-12T08:05:00.000Z	atoponce	Mikey	what exactly are you looking for? installing ubuntu server with no X, or using a live cd with no X?
2007-04-12T08:06:00.000Z	Mikey	atoponce	im looking for a command line system to run on a VM to suppliment my windoze :)
2007-04-12T08:06:00.000Z	atoponce	Mikey	ok. so you want an install with no X? then the server cd is what you want
2007-04-12T08:14:00.000Z	atoponce	Mikey	server edition: http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download
2007-04-12T08:14:00.000Z	Mikey	atoponce	yea i allready dled it, thx
2007-04-12T08:14:00.000Z	atoponce	Mikey	np
2007-04-12T08:14:00.000Z	Mikey	atoponce	im gonna install it in qemu right now
2007-04-12T08:14:00.000Z	atoponce	Mikey	sweet. good luck. :)
2007-04-12T08:16:00.000Z	Mikey	atoponce	is server installs as cli by default? becasue i remember from dapper alt cd, you pick cli only
2007-04-12T08:18:00.000Z	atoponce	Mikey	server only installs cli. no X at all. if you want X, you'll need to 'sudo aptitude install ubuntu-desktop'
2007-04-12T08:18:00.000Z	Mikey	atoponce	no i dont want x, thats the whole point haha
