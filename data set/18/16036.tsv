2004-11-26T11:30:00.000Z	rasher	xoxoxo	you still need to type your password for sudo
2004-11-26T11:30:00.000Z	rasher	xoxoxo	also, *don't* leave your computer open
2004-11-26T11:31:00.000Z	rasher	xoxoxo	the thing is, they *still* need your password to sudo things
2004-11-26T11:32:00.000Z	rasher	xoxoxo	your own password
2004-11-26T11:32:00.000Z	rasher	xoxoxo	do you even know how sudo works?
2004-11-26T11:35:00.000Z	rasher	xoxoxo	congratulations, you just did what 10 people were trying to tell you is a bad idea

2004-11-26T11:36:00.000Z	xoxoxo	rasher	why not?
2004-11-26T11:37:00.000Z	rasher	xoxoxo	you're not supposed to use the root account directly, only through sudo
2004-11-26T11:38:00.000Z	rasher	xoxoxo	yes, after typing your password
2004-11-26T12:30:00.000Z	rasher	xoxoxo	using nautilus is one way
