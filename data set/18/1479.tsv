2011-02-06T01:52:00.000Z	evulhotdog		okay explain this, it chnaged the text cursor icon, and the link button icon, but not the main cursor YankDownUnder :P
2011-02-06T01:54:00.000Z	evulhotdog		no themes
2011-02-06T01:54:00.000Z	evulhotdog		pure default ubuntu
2011-02-06T01:54:00.000Z	evulhotdog		other than compiz settings changes.
2011-02-06T01:55:00.000Z	evulhotdog		let me try
2011-02-06T01:56:00.000Z	evulhotdog		okay
2011-02-06T01:56:00.000Z	evulhotdog		icons worked
2011-02-06T01:56:00.000Z	evulhotdog		changed in the 'places'
2011-02-06T01:56:00.000Z	evulhotdog		Like I said, its odd that the cursor when hovering over text, changed, and the link hand changed, but the main cursor did not. I just want a black cursor!! haha
2011-02-06T01:58:00.000Z	evulhotdog		btw installed a custom theme, still didnt change the main cursor. ( i have oxygen, haha, it changes the 'loading' icon, link icon, and text icon (icon==cursor) but doesnt change the main plain cursor
2011-02-06T01:58:00.000Z	thorbj0rn	evulhotdog	there is a whole other selection dialog for cursors
2011-02-06T01:59:00.000Z	thorbj0rn	evulhotdog	Appearance > Themes > Customize > Pointer
2011-02-07T07:21:00.000Z	thorbj0rn	evulhotdog	better than without a report.
2011-02-07T07:21:00.000Z	evulhotdog	thorbj0rn	obv
2011-02-07T07:24:00.000Z	thorbj0rn	evulhotdog	try installing that? http://live.gnome.org/BatteryStatus
2011-02-07T07:24:00.000Z	evulhotdog	thorbj0rn	I think it may be a problem with acpi though :O
2011-02-07T07:25:00.000Z	thorbj0rn	evulhotdog	kk, i'm not too well versed in the battery applet anyhow.
2011-02-07T07:27:00.000Z	thorbj0rn	evulhotdog	battery-status is a seperate application from the default gnome powermanager
