2007-08-07T10:47:00.000Z	ravigehlot		After installing Apache2 I see that my httpd.conf file is empty. Why is that?
2007-08-07T10:47:00.000Z	craig_	ravigehlot	you need to now edit apache.conf
2007-08-07T10:47:00.000Z	ravigehlot	craig_	What is in there to edit if the file is empty? Is there a sample fiel?
2007-08-07T10:47:00.000Z	craig_	ravigehlot	in /etc/apache2
2007-08-07T10:48:00.000Z	craig_	ravigehlot	is there such a folder?
2007-08-07T10:48:00.000Z	ravigehlot	craig_	Yes. /etc/apache2/
2007-08-07T10:48:00.000Z	craig_	ravigehlot	all set?
2007-08-07T10:48:00.000Z	ravigehlot	craig_	the httpd.conf file is present but empty
2007-08-07T10:48:00.000Z	ravigehlot	craig_	yes the server is running

2007-08-07T10:49:00.000Z	ravigehlot	craig_	apache2.conf is filled but it does not have DirectoryIndex
2007-08-07T10:49:00.000Z	ravigehlot	craig_	I am looking for DirectoryIndex
2007-08-07T10:49:00.000Z	craig_	ravigehlot	you now have to deal with sites enabled.  You trying to do virtual hosting, right?

2007-08-07T10:50:00.000Z	ravigehlot	craig_	I do ColdFusion development and I need to have Apache read .cfm files. So I need to add it to the DirectoryIndex
