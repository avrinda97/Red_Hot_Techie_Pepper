2007-06-11T05:04:00.000Z	FireHazard17		how come ubntu's kernel is not the most recent?
2007-06-11T05:04:00.000Z	ikonia	FireHazard17	because thats the version that was in use when the ubuntu version was packaged
2007-06-11T05:05:00.000Z	ikonia	FireHazard17	so ?
2007-06-11T05:06:00.000Z	ikonia	FireHazard17	no reason to change
2007-06-11T05:13:00.000Z	ikonia	FireHazard17	no you can't
2007-06-11T05:13:00.000Z	FireHazard17	ikonia	what?
2007-06-11T05:14:00.000Z	ikonia	FireHazard17	if you can update the kernel you can't update anything else
2007-06-11T05:14:00.000Z	FireHazard17	ikonia	WHAT?
2007-06-11T05:14:00.000Z	ikonia	FireHazard17	if you can update the kernel you can't update anything else
2007-06-11T05:15:00.000Z	ikonia	FireHazard17	pretty much any system libraries that are core to the distro
2007-12-10T05:04:00.000Z	ikonia	FireHazard17	thats nosense
2007-12-10T05:04:00.000Z	FireHazard17	ikonia	oh really?
2007-12-10T05:02:00.000Z	ikonia	FireHazard17	1.) why are you using hardy 2.) why do you want 64bit
2007-12-10T05:03:00.000Z	ikonia	FireHazard17	no, we are realistic in offering sound advice
2007-12-10T05:04:00.000Z	ikonia	FireHazard17	yes, really
2007-12-10T05:04:00.000Z	ikonia	FireHazard17	use what you want, but remember you will get no support for hardy as a user
2007-12-10T05:05:00.000Z	ikonia	FireHazard17	you have the warnings and the options, do with it as you will
2007-12-10T05:05:00.000Z	ikonia	FireHazard17	then you will break your package manager. good luck
