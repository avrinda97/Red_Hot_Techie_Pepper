2008-09-06T03:36:00.000Z	powertool08		When I try to mount a blank cd dolphin says could not start process Unable to create io-slave: klauncher said: unknown protocol ''.. Whats causing this?
2008-09-06T03:38:00.000Z	powertool08		Agent bob, you need key pair, cat the pubkey to authorized_keys on the remote host, private key on your local host in ~/.ssh/id_rsa
2008-09-06T03:38:00.000Z	Agent_bob	powertool08	yes authorized_keys is correct
2008-09-06T03:39:00.000Z	Agent_bob	powertool08	remote doesn't need id_rsa does it ?
2008-09-06T03:40:00.000Z	powertool08	Agent_bob	no I don't think so
2008-09-06T03:40:00.000Z	Agent_bob	powertool08	hmmm i must have a misconfigured sshd_conf then
2008-09-06T03:41:00.000Z	powertool08	Agent_bob	well, it needs id_rsa.pub to check the private key against
2008-09-06T03:41:00.000Z	Agent_bob	powertool08	</blinks> ?
2008-09-06T03:43:00.000Z	Agent_bob	powertool08	i thought id_rsa.pub local was checked against authorized_keys remote   with incription from id_rsa local  ?
2008-09-06T03:43:00.000Z	Agent_bob		am i all wet ?
2008-09-06T03:44:00.000Z	powertool08	Agent_bob	when I set mine up, I generated a key pair on the remote host I wanted to log into, cat the id_rsa.pub to authorized_keys of the user I would log in as, put id_rsa (private key) on my usb drive, then connect from my laptop with ssh -i /path/to/usb/id_rsa user@host
2008-09-06T03:44:00.000Z	powertool08	Agent_bob	and make sure your /etc/ssh/sshd_config has "pubkey_authentication yes"
2008-09-06T03:46:00.000Z	Agent_bob	powertool08	right.   i have a master key for several boxen, and it works on all of them but on some more restricted accounts i have only ~/.ssh/authorized_keys     but for one box that seems to not be enough.  so it's probably a sshd_config issue.  thanks for the input
2008-09-06T03:47:00.000Z	powertool08	Agent_bob	if you want to pastebin your sshd_config I can compare to mine, it might turn up something?
2008-09-06T03:55:00.000Z	Agent_bob	powertool08	it's ok.   i think i figured it out.   thanks anyway.
2008-09-06T03:55:00.000Z	Agent_bob	powertool08	it's the users shell  ;/
2008-09-06T03:56:00.000Z	powertool08	Agent_bob	ah
2008-09-06T03:57:00.000Z	Agent_bob	powertool08	i out smarted myself again.    using bin/true for a shell prevents ssh login because it starts in / and not in ~/   ;/
