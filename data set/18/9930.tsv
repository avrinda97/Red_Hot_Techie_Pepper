2008-12-18T21:22:00.000Z	GNUtoo		hello, is this motherboard supported by ubuntu: http://www.asus.com/products.aspx?l1=3&l2=11&l3=627&l4=0&model=2033&modelmenu=2
2008-12-18T21:22:00.000Z	GNUtoo		?
2008-12-18T21:23:00.000Z	sipior	GNUtoo	have you tried googling "board name" + Ubuntu | Linux ?
2008-12-18T21:23:00.000Z	GNUtoo	sipior	good idea...
2008-12-18T21:24:00.000Z	GNUtoo	sipior	before that i had chosen another mainboard but it had jmicron and realtech(10/100/1000) chips that had problems...so  i've choosen this one now
2008-12-18T21:38:00.000Z	GNUtoo	sipior	i only find post on windows or on hardware with a link to a ubuntu part of the forum...
2008-12-18T21:39:00.000Z	GNUtoo	sipior	mabe i'll look for lspci instead of ubuntu
2008-12-18T21:39:00.000Z	sipior	GNUtoo	and linux turned up nothing?
2008-12-18T21:40:00.000Z	GNUtoo	sipior	ah...i'm trying it now...i found something
2008-12-18T21:48:00.000Z	GNUtoo	sipior	ouch...i don't find the card in the linux kenrel in Ethernet(1000 Mbit)
2008-12-18T21:49:00.000Z	GNUtoo	sipior	it's a nvidia card...is it supported by an external driver?
2008-12-18T21:54:00.000Z	sipior	GNUtoo	i doubt it. to be honest, unless there is an overwhelming technical reason to choose this board, it's probably best to play it safe. unless you're willing to experiment, of course...
2008-12-18T21:54:00.000Z	GNUtoo	sipior	so which board should I choose...it's the second mainboard that has problems with ubuntu...
2008-12-18T21:56:00.000Z	GNUtoo	sipior	alternatively the sata_nv chip is supported by the kernel,and the audio chip too...so mabe i could buy the board with a pci network card if necessary
2008-12-18T21:57:00.000Z	sipior	GNUtoo	there you go. gbit network cards are cheap.
2008-12-18T21:57:00.000Z	GNUtoo	sipior	10/100 are sufficent i think
2008-12-18T21:57:00.000Z	sipior	GNUtoo	even cheaper, then
2008-12-18T21:57:00.000Z	GNUtoo	sipior	it's only for connecting to the internet
