2010-10-14T19:27:00.000Z	alan__		Hey.
2010-10-14T19:27:00.000Z	alan__		For some reason my linux ubuntu 10.10 is slow? Any reasons?
2010-10-14T19:28:00.000Z	alan__		When i had a lower version of ubuntu it was fine but sense i installed 10.10 today, its been slow to hell.
2010-10-14T19:29:00.000Z	dli	alan__	run 'top' in terminal
2010-10-14T19:33:00.000Z	dli	alan__	make sure you have free Mem: Swap:, do not have high usually on %CPU %MEM. if you say something like 99 , 49, etc.

2010-10-14T19:36:00.000Z	dli	alan__	plugin! must be from adobe flash :( sudo pkill -9 plugin
2010-10-14T19:37:00.000Z	alan__	dli	I've killed it now.
2010-10-14T19:38:00.000Z	dli	alan__	adobe is the one to blame, not ubuntu
2010-10-14T19:39:00.000Z	alan__	dli	How can i stop this loading at start up so it doesnt hog my CPU?
2010-10-14T19:40:00.000Z	dli	alan__	there are open source flash plugins out there, not sure whether they are acceptable for you or not
2010-10-14T19:40:00.000Z	dli	alan__	apt-cache search flash|grep plugin
2010-10-14T19:42:00.000Z	alan__	dli	What one do you recommend
2010-10-14T19:43:00.000Z	dli	alan__	I suggest you to try lightspark, which is not in ubuntu yet
2010-10-14T19:43:00.000Z	dli	alan__	lightspark uses less cpu then adobe flash, but not yet feature complete
2010-10-14T19:44:00.000Z	dli	alan__	if you just want to play youtube, sudo apt-get install minitube
2010-10-14T19:44:00.000Z	dli	alan__	lightspark can play all youtube too
2010-10-14T19:46:00.000Z	dli	alan__	your home directory is '~', "$HOME" in terminal
