2012-04-27T18:53:00.000Z	jrib	EuropaCar	yes...
2012-04-27T18:53:00.000Z	jrib	EuropaCar	try pastebinning the full message you are seeing from update-manager
2012-04-27T19:00:00.000Z	jrib	EuropaCar	please don't repeat so often
2012-04-27T19:09:00.000Z	jrib	EuropaCar	you cannot skip (not supported) unless you are on LTS
2012-04-27T19:10:00.000Z	jrib	EuropaCar	what do you want to do?
2012-04-27T19:11:00.000Z	jrib	EuropaCar	is it still downloading?  You can safely cancel and try to resume the download.  Make sure you're using a local mirror in your software sources
2012-04-27T19:13:00.000Z	jrib	EuropaCar	please don't use enter so much and try to address users you are speaking to by prefixing what you say with their name
2012-04-27T19:14:00.000Z	jrib	EuropaCar	well I don't see much choice for you
2012-04-27T19:15:00.000Z	jrib	EuropaCar	personally, I would stop the upgrade, remove the flashplugin-install package, resume the update
2012-04-27T19:16:00.000Z	EuropaCar	jrib	i am not using a fresh install and i'm updating from 10.10, can i abort the installation and restart it safely?
2012-04-27T19:16:00.000Z	jrib	EuropaCar	regardless of whether you can do it "safely", I do not see an alternative for you
2012-04-27T19:17:00.000Z	EuropaCar	jrib	ok, i will give it a go, thanks for your help
