2011-01-10T05:06:00.000Z	ajcis55		bash: /bin/ls: no such file or directory.
2011-01-10T05:06:00.000Z	ajcis55		Yes. I have a cd in there.
2011-01-10T05:07:00.000Z	ajcis55		It's a vm.
2011-01-10T05:07:00.000Z	ajcis55		oh
2011-01-10T05:07:00.000Z	ajcis55		yes
2011-01-10T05:07:00.000Z	ajcis55		I can cd to /bin and /sbin
2011-01-10T05:07:00.000Z	ajcis55		but running the commands returns the same error.
2011-01-10T05:07:00.000Z	ajcis55		I do.
2011-01-10T05:08:00.000Z	ajcis55		dir /bin/ls does return files.
2011-01-10T05:08:00.000Z	ajcis55		err, the file.
2011-01-10T05:08:00.000Z	vocx	ajcis55	do this "echo $PATH"
2011-01-10T05:09:00.000Z	vocx	ajcis55	is that correct, double colon ::   ?
2011-01-10T05:18:00.000Z	ajcis55	vocx	edbian: are you guys out of ideas already?
2011-01-10T05:19:00.000Z	vocx	ajcis55	I don't know about your problem specifically. I think you mentioned something about a virtual machine, but didn't read your question from the beginning. Perhaps, repost your question altogether.
2011-01-10T05:23:00.000Z	vocx	ajcis55	was that in a virtual machine? It's still not clear.
2011-01-10T05:24:00.000Z	vocx	ajcis55	try running any command with its full path, /bin/ls
2011-01-10T05:25:00.000Z	vocx	ajcis55	perhaps the partition got an error and the filesystem was mounted with no executable permissions. Perhaps reboot?
2011-01-10T05:42:00.000Z	ajcis55	vocx	thanks for trying. I posted a topic in the forum.
