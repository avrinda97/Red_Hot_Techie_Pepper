2005-04-11T09:39:00.000Z	mdz	nealmcb	that page is about trying to differentiate between pressed CDs and CD-Rs
2005-04-11T09:35:00.000Z	mdz	nealmcb	what sort of integrity check?
2005-04-11T09:35:00.000Z	nealmcb	mdz	I want to check that the burn was good.  I'm getting a "failed to copy file from cdrom" error on boot
2005-04-11T09:35:00.000Z	mdz	nealmcb	you might be able to run the standard CD integrity check in expert mode, but it won't mean much on the live CD
2005-04-11T09:36:00.000Z	mdz	nealmcb	if you're getting an error like that, it's very likely that the burn is bad
2005-04-11T09:37:00.000Z	nealmcb	mdz	hmmm - knoppix has always had a nice way on live boot to check the cdrom.  What does cdrom-checker do if not that?
2005-04-11T09:38:00.000Z	nealmcb	mdz	from this page I get the sense that a cd can be burned to always check integrity.  but perhaps not as an option?  odd...  http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/HoaryHedgehogBurnDetection/view?searchterm=cdrom-checker
2005-04-11T09:38:00.000Z	mdz	nealmcb	it checks the install CD
2005-04-11T09:40:00.000Z	mdz	nealmcb	hmm, in fact cdrom-checker will check the live CD data, now that I look
2005-04-11T09:41:00.000Z	nealmcb	mdz	yeah, but with the goal of checking integrity.  why would live cds not have that option?  what were you  saying about doing  it in expert mode?
2005-04-11T09:42:00.000Z	mdz	nealmcb	the reason why the live CD might not have that option is because it might not be implemented yet
2005-04-11T09:44:00.000Z	mdz	nealmcb	at the "boot:" prompt, type "live-expert"
2005-04-11T09:44:00.000Z	mdz	nealmcb	you should be able to run an integrity check from there
2005-04-11T09:45:00.000Z	nealmcb	mdz	I'll look again - but don't remember it being obvious the first time around (though I wasn't looking for it then)
2005-04-11T09:45:00.000Z	nealmcb	mdz	thanks for the  help though!
2005-04-11T09:45:00.000Z	mdz	nealmcb	I just checked; it's there
2005-04-11T09:46:00.000Z	nealmcb	mdz	I just saw it also - many thanks!!
2005-04-11T09:48:00.000Z	nealmcb	mdz	bingo.  I'll try burning for the  third time, more slowly....
