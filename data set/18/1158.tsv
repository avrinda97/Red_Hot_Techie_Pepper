2011-05-15T04:19:00.000Z	trism	nikhgupta	are you trying to source a file for an interactive session? you can use bash --init-file=/path/to/file (although bashrc should be sourced for non-login shells, so I'm not sure why you need to source that)
2011-05-15T04:21:00.000Z	nikhgupta	trism	I am not actually trying to do that.. Thing is I am trying to run this command: "rvm use 1.8.7 && rails console", but then my shell gives me file or directory not found (which I am thinking is because my .bashrc was never sourced for this new terminal
2011-05-15T04:28:00.000Z	trism	nikhgupta	I see, might be better to create a script and then gnome-terminal -e /path/to/script
2011-05-15T04:29:00.000Z	nikhgupta	trism	thanks.. checking :)
2011-05-15T04:34:00.000Z	nikhgupta	trism	no luck..! I get the same error that the file: <command_name> was not found..
2011-05-15T04:38:00.000Z	nikhgupta	trism	here is the pastebin for what I am doing: http://pastebin.com/1gDruE7F
2011-05-15T04:40:00.000Z	trism	nikhgupta	where is rvm?
2011-05-15T04:40:00.000Z	nikhgupta	trism	rvm is a sourced script... however, result is same if I try to run anything else e.g. even 'type'
2011-05-15T04:43:00.000Z	nikhgupta	trism	rvm is sourced in .bashrc
2011-05-15T04:46:00.000Z	trism	nikhgupta	you should try to set it up in another script, and then have .bashrc source that, because it seems .bashrc won't get sourced properly when not running interactively
2011-05-15T04:48:00.000Z	trism	nikhgupta	I would create three different scripts, one for each of the rvm tabs, and have each of them source whatever you need for the rvm command at the top, then open a tab with those scripts in gnome-terminal
2011-05-15T04:50:00.000Z	nikhgupta	trism	just to explain more, simply running gnome-terminal is sourcing my .bashrc - i can say because I have a custom prompt in it.
2011-05-15T04:50:00.000Z	nikhgupta	trism	I am trying your fix.. thank you for helping me here :)
2011-05-15T04:53:00.000Z	nikhgupta	trism	 can you let me know if you are able to run some custom alias this way: gnome-terminal -e <customalias> ? or if this is the right way to run an alias in a child terminal?
2011-05-15T04:55:00.000Z	trism	nikhgupta	yeah, I don't think that will work
2011-05-15T04:56:00.000Z	nikhgupta	trism	ohkay thanks.. I am trying more now.. I will try to check whats wrong and follow your fix and if I can not make it work, I will be back later then :) really thanks for your help.. :)
2011-05-15T04:59:00.000Z	trism	nikhgupta	good luck
2011-05-15T05:07:00.000Z	trism	nikhgupta	if you're still around, there is another issue, it appears bash won't expand aliases when not running interactively, unless you set: shopt -s expand_aliases; before attempting to run the alias
