2009-06-02T08:16:00.000Z	cabrey		apt-get is deprecated, use aptitude
2009-06-02T08:16:00.000Z	cabrey		!aptitude
2009-06-02T08:17:00.000Z	fccf	cabrey	so untrue .. aptitude uses apt-get
2009-06-02T08:18:00.000Z	cabrey	fccf	debian has officially recommended aptitude over apt-get
2009-06-02T08:19:00.000Z	fccf	cabrey	and ubuntu ships with add/remove - personally I use synaptic
2009-06-02T08:20:00.000Z	cabrey	fccf	i know, i prefer CLI more efficient :)
2009-06-02T08:21:00.000Z	fccf	cabrey	so you use apt-get because it is true CLI - where as aptitude has it's own interface
2009-06-04T05:31:00.000Z	cabrey	fccf	it is seriously faster
2009-06-04T05:31:00.000Z	fccf	cabrey	would I notice on my dual core ...ed_debian: till it crashes

2009-06-09T23:31:00.000Z	fccf	cabrey	please don't diss VNC .. it works very well for me .. I can sit at starbucks all day and access my server
2009-06-09T23:31:00.000Z	cabrey	fccf	I get horrible lag even on the same LAN
2009-06-09T23:32:00.000Z	fccf	cabrey	I live in a place where 3mbit connections are commonplace so lagging is not an issue
2009-06-09T23:33:00.000Z	cabrey	fccf	no matter how much bandwidth i give it, it still lags
2009-06-09T23:33:00.000Z	fccf	cabrey	funny, I am using UltraVNC on a windows xp client ... works really well
2009-06-23T01:04:00.000Z	cabrey	fccf	don't tell me, I know I can resize NTFS :)
