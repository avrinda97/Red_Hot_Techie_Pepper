2011-05-01T00:55:00.000Z	MattC		I am having an issue regarding installing ubuntu...
2011-05-01T00:55:00.000Z	MattC		I downloaded the CD from the website,
2011-05-01T00:55:00.000Z	MattC		and used it to install.
2011-05-01T00:56:00.000Z	MattC		once the installation was done
2011-05-01T00:56:00.000Z	gmachine_24	MattC	Please tell us what the problem is and which version of Ubuntu, etc.
2011-05-01T00:56:00.000Z	MattC		it asked me to remove the CD so it could re-boot.
2011-05-01T00:57:00.000Z	MattC		so after I did, and it rebooted, it just sat there.
2011-05-01T00:57:00.000Z	gmachine_24	MattC	which version of Ubuntu?
2011-05-01T00:57:00.000Z	MattC		after going thru the POST screen
2011-05-01T00:58:00.000Z	gmachine_24	MattC	You might try turning the computer off completely and restarting it.
2011-05-01T00:58:00.000Z	gmachine_24		I know it sounds silly, .... but sometimes that does it
2011-05-01T00:58:00.000Z	MattC	gmachine_24	11.04
2011-05-01T00:58:00.000Z	gmachine_24	MattC	do you have any other installs on your hard drive?
2011-05-01T00:59:00.000Z	MattC		no
2011-05-01T00:59:00.000Z	gmachine_24	MattC	did you shut the computer off and restart it?
2011-05-01T00:59:00.000Z	MattC		many times,
2011-05-01T00:59:00.000Z	gmachine_24	MattC	ok
2011-05-01T01:00:00.000Z	gmachine_24	MattC	I don't know what to tell you. Did you check hardware compatibility? Were you running an earlier version of Ubuntu before 11.04? If so, which one?
