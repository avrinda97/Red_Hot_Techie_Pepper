2010-04-16T21:30:00.000Z	iceroot	BluesKaj	there is a big difference in terminals but not in the shells they are using
2010-04-16T21:32:00.000Z	iceroot	BluesKaj	terminal = gnome-terminal, konsole, xterm and so on, shell = sh, bash, zsh, csh and so on
2010-04-16T21:33:00.000Z	iceroot	BluesKaj	gnome is using gnome-terminal, kde is using konsole, so there are difference in the terminal but not in the shell they are using (bash)

2010-04-16T21:34:00.000Z	iceroot	BluesKaj	i am just correcting you because you are mixing shell and terminal
2010-04-16T21:38:00.000Z	BluesKaj	iceroot	correcting something that doesn't mean anything to the user is not useful
2010-04-16T21:38:00.000Z	iceroot	BluesKaj	not correcting wrong things is also not useful

2010-10-01T17:43:00.000Z	iceroot	BluesKaj	compiz = fusion
2010-10-01T17:45:00.000Z	BluesKaj	iceroot	I'm aware , but I don't see the point...perhaps you can help because I haven't used compz-fusion much, I'm satisfied with the effects I have by default
