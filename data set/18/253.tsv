2012-05-21T04:46:00.000Z	tbrown_2012		I do
2012-05-21T04:48:00.000Z	L3top	tbrown_2012	clearly you don't, as if you read what the bot said you would see there is a compatibility database for things that do and do not run in wine.
2012-05-21T04:52:00.000Z	L3top	tbrown_2012	your question isn't terribly specific and I thought you would have better luck in #winehq
2012-05-21T04:52:00.000Z	tbrown_2012	L3top	That does not make any sense
2012-05-21T04:52:00.000Z	tbrown_2012	L3top	#winehq Does not have any people in it
2012-05-21T04:56:00.000Z	tbrown_2012	L3top	And my Qestion did make sense. I said for the second time. How can I load application on ubuntu running winehq. Ok let me go into it a little deeper for you to understand. Some appication work and dont work on WINEHQ and I know I understand that 100%. But Am trying to load games or appication that I use in a regulare basees Cant spell sorry. But I hope you understand that everyone that I run does not work I can find
2012-05-21T04:57:00.000Z	L3top	tbrown_2012	you must make sure that the programs have the executable bit checked (right click, properties, permissions).
2012-05-21T04:59:00.000Z	tbrown_2012	L3top	I know that already. aaa: But only  when I do it I get a error
2012-05-21T05:01:00.000Z	L3top	tbrown_2012	all this time, are you saying that your problem is setting the executable bit, and not actually runing an .exe in wine?
2012-05-21T05:03:00.000Z	L3top	tbrown_2012	sudo chown $USER: /path/to/whatever.exe
2012-05-21T06:49:00.000Z	L3top	tbrown_2012	lspci | grep VGA
2012-05-21T06:50:00.000Z	tbrown_2012	L3top	Explane your self please:)
2012-05-21T19:40:00.000Z	L3top	tbrown_2012	then you did not install on the same partition, but the same disk
2012-05-21T19:40:00.000Z	tbrown_2012	L3top	Yes
2012-05-21T19:41:00.000Z	L3top	tbrown_2012	fdisk -l /dev/sda
2012-05-21T19:41:00.000Z	tbrown_2012	L3top	what does that do?
