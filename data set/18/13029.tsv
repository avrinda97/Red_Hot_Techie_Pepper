2006-01-28T12:08:00.000Z	glacious		what is a good way to manage your wireless connection(s) in gnome?
2006-01-28T12:08:00.000Z	glacious		we have a large ESS here, with many AP's with the same SSID, different channels.
2006-01-28T12:08:00.000Z	glacious		i want a utility like with XP that will pick the strongest AP of that SSID and connect
2006-01-28T12:09:00.000Z	glacious		just lists every AP that it finds
2006-01-28T12:09:00.000Z	glacious		even if there are like 5 AP's with the same name, just on different channels.  it won't just pick the strongest one to show.  nor does it show signal strength at all
2006-01-28T12:11:00.000Z	topyli	glacious	networkmanager should do it on dapper
2006-01-28T12:12:00.000Z	topyli	glacious	http://www.gnome.org/projects/NetworkManager/
2006-01-28T12:26:00.000Z	glacious	topyli	 it wants to install bind9?  won't this mess with my school's network?
2006-01-28T12:27:00.000Z	topyli	glacious	i have no idea. i guess it won't if your school's network is setup even adequately
2006-01-28T12:48:00.000Z	topyli	glacious	try the menu: system -> prefs -> themes
2006-01-28T12:49:00.000Z	glacious	topyli	thats not for GTK and icons tho is it?
2006-01-28T12:49:00.000Z	topyli	glacious	are you using gnome?
2006-01-28T12:50:00.000Z	glacious	topyli	yes
2006-01-28T12:50:00.000Z	topyli	glacious	then yes, you can change everything there
2006-01-28T12:50:00.000Z	glacious	topyli	ok, thank you.
2006-01-28T12:50:00.000Z	topyli	glacious	just explore the "theme details" stuff
2006-01-28T12:54:00.000Z	glacious	topyli	theres an 'install theme' button.  what kind of theme is it looking for?  like what kind of file?  a GDM theme?  GTK theme file?
2006-01-28T12:55:00.000Z	topyli	glacious	gtk, metacity, icon themes
