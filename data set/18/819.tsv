2011-09-16T16:30:00.000Z	xosuitehearts		Is anyone on that is experienced with WINE?
2011-09-16T16:30:00.000Z	xosuitehearts		anyone?
2011-09-16T16:30:00.000Z	Dmole	xosuitehearts	I use basic wine
2011-09-16T16:31:00.000Z	xosuitehearts		I heard that WINE can get malware?
2011-09-16T16:31:00.000Z	xosuitehearts		If what all parts of my Linux system can it infect?
2011-09-16T16:31:00.000Z	xosuitehearts	Dmole	are you knowledgable with WINE?
2011-09-16T16:32:00.000Z	xosuitehearts		thanks mate
2011-09-16T16:33:00.000Z	Dmole		xosuitehearts:anything can get malware but it's unlikely in wine because if it runs in wine you will see it running and you can kill it, otherwise it's a rootkit and it makes no difference if you have wine or not.... overall I'd say it's less likely than a normal linux malware
2011-09-16T16:34:00.000Z	xosuitehearts	Dmole	say I get a trojan virii in WINE
2011-09-16T16:34:00.000Z	xosuitehearts	Dmole	would it fuck with my Linux filesystem as well?
2011-09-16T16:35:00.000Z	xosuitehearts		sorry pici, my fault
2011-09-16T16:36:00.000Z	Dmole	xosuitehearts	yes it could but more likely it would just crash in the strange enviroment, you can check for sure by installing one there is some website that keeps sample malware for testing and detection  ("kill wine" would kill it)
2011-09-16T16:37:00.000Z	Dmole	xosuitehearts	if you want to "harden" wine run it in a jail/chroot, or vm
2011-09-16T16:39:00.000Z	xosuitehearts	Dmole	alright, so say I have a keygen.exe for windows and im running it in Wine, and its a trojan, will it play Slaughterhouse on my Linux system?
2011-09-16T16:42:00.000Z	xosuitehearts	Dmole	and by slaughterhouse I mean "slaughter my house" of files and passwords and encrypted data on my Linux file system
2011-09-16T16:42:00.000Z	Dmole	xosuitehearts	if you want to know: only one way to find out, test it. if you just want to run it safely chroot wine and it will not be able to touch linux.
2011-09-16T16:43:00.000Z	xosuitehearts	Dmole	and if it does? would it do much effect? because it would be a Windows OS virii?
2011-09-16T16:44:00.000Z	Dmole	xosuitehearts	I did say "only one way to find out" ....
