2006-04-29T15:10:00.000Z	firepol		hi huys, i want to use the latest version of amarok, to do so i see i must use the dapper packages (else there are dependency problems) do you think im safe to upgrade to dapper?
2006-04-29T15:11:00.000Z	gnomefreak	firepol	go to that link there is amarok repos
2006-04-29T15:11:00.000Z	gnomefreak	firepol	what do you mean there isnt?
2006-04-29T15:12:00.000Z	gnomefreak	firepol	1st mistake was mixing breezy and dappers repos
2006-04-29T15:15:00.000Z	gnomefreak	firepol	define doesnt work?
2006-04-29T15:15:00.000Z	gnomefreak	firepol	no pasting
2006-04-29T15:15:00.000Z	gnomefreak	firepol	run sudo apt-get update and paste the full thing to me on pastebin please
2006-04-29T15:18:00.000Z	gnomefreak	firepol	go to kubuntu's main page i think its kubuntu.com and you will see different "working" repos for kubuntu and amarok
2006-04-29T15:20:00.000Z	firepol	gnomefreak	ill do that
2006-04-29T15:25:00.000Z	firepol	gnomefreak	seems that amarok is no more releasing breezuy packages. latest trunks are available only for dapper
2006-04-29T15:25:00.000Z	firepol	gnomefreak	do you think Ill break my distro if I upgrade to dapper now?
2006-04-29T15:26:00.000Z	gnomefreak	firepol	theres that chance but its for most part "safe" or atleast the devel team feels it is
2006-04-29T15:27:00.000Z	gnomefreak	firepol	i suggest if you want to upgrade to first make sure ubuntu-desktop is installed or kubuntu-desktop if using kde than changing sources.list to dappers list (will have ubotu send you list) and than sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
2006-04-29T15:27:00.000Z	gnomefreak	firepol	the devel team for kubuntu uses kubuntu
2006-04-29T15:28:00.000Z	gnomefreak	firepol	or it wouldnt be developed
2006-04-29T15:29:00.000Z	gnomefreak	firepol	use the link that ends in 6666 and replace yours with that
2006-04-29T15:30:00.000Z	firepol	gnomefreak	i dont get the "6666", what do you mean with that number?
2006-04-29T15:31:00.000Z	gnomefreak	firepol	look in your pm
