2005-04-17T12:14:00.000Z	LiberalTugboat		thats not a stupid question
2005-04-17T12:15:00.000Z	LiberalTugboat		I deal with windows users 8 hours a day, no computer question is stupid to me
2005-04-17T12:16:00.000Z	LiberalTugboat		yeah, sometimes you just want to smack them
2005-04-17T12:16:00.000Z	LiberalTugboat		the worse comes from mac users though
2005-04-17T12:17:00.000Z	LiberalTugboat		we had a mac user come in, he has a g5 imac, he wanted to buy some screen cleaner, (we dont deal with macs) but he was afraid the "pc" lcd cleaner wouldnt be compatible with his mac
2005-04-17T12:18:00.000Z	LiberalTugboat		so he had us search the apple web site to see if they had a compatibility list
2005-04-17T12:19:00.000Z	LiberalTugboat		of couse we couldnt find a "screen cleaner" combatibility list
2005-04-17T12:19:00.000Z	LiberalTugboat		so he bought the cleaner
2005-04-17T12:19:00.000Z	LiberalTugboat		30 mins later he brought it back
2005-04-17T12:20:00.000Z	LiberalTugboat		saying " I went to the mac store and bought mac compatible cleaner for a few dollars more, can I return this"
