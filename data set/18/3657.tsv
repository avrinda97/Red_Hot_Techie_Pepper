2011-06-25T09:43:00.000Z	JoshDreamland		Under output, the device "Dummy Output" appears.
2011-06-25T09:43:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	JoshDreamland	Are you outputting to a dummy?
2011-06-25T09:44:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	JoshDreamland	Well! Issue resolved! NEXT!!! ;)
2011-06-25T09:45:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	JoshDreamland	You said you reconfigured something with your sound system - what exactly? And have you tried to revert to the way it was before you changed anything?
2011-06-25T09:46:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	JoshDreamland	So you changed from Pulse to ALSA?
2011-06-25T09:46:00.000Z	JoshDreamland	YankDownUnder	Not that I know of
2011-06-25T09:46:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	JoshDreamland	Roger that.
2011-06-25T09:57:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	JoshDreamland	Now THAT is strange...and you've checked through both the input and output hardware, double-checked everything, eh?
2011-06-25T09:58:00.000Z	JoshDreamland	YankDownUnder	Actually, at this point, I can't even tell I have a sound system installed.
2011-06-25T09:59:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	JoshDreamland	...check the hardware, AND the profile - do the "test speakers" for each/any of the profiles...check the "Hardware" tab again...
2011-06-25T09:59:00.000Z	JoshDreamland	YankDownUnder	I have no access to the hardware tab. Nothing's running.
2011-06-25T10:00:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	JoshDreamland	Have you tried checking the drivers => run "jockey-gtk" and see if the drivers can be found or can be activated...????
2011-06-25T10:01:00.000Z	JoshDreamland	YankDownUnder	The sound system was working perfectly 15 minutes ago. Also, there aren't any additional drivers.
2011-06-25T10:01:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	JoshDreamland	Did you put yourself back into the audio group?
2011-06-25T10:03:00.000Z	JoshDreamland	YankDownUnder	No, only pulse is a member of the audio group
2011-06-25T10:06:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	JoshDreamland	Keep giving it a go - I must do the manly thing and go retrieve my missus from work - so she can come home and work some more... ;)
2011-06-25T10:06:00.000Z	JoshDreamland	YankDownUnder	Have fun. I'm out of ideas.
2011-06-25T10:07:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	JoshDreamland	Look through the Ubuntu forums...you might surprise yerself...
