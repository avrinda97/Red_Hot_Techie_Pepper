2009-01-24T06:32:00.000Z	karamazov		hello
2009-01-24T06:32:00.000Z	karamazov		i've installed ubuntu server on virtualbox and setup samba on the ubuntu server
2009-01-24T06:33:00.000Z	karamazov		now how can i access files on this virtual ubuntu server?
2009-01-24T06:33:00.000Z	karamazov		do i have to forward some ports since virtualbox places ubuntu server on a different internal network?
2009-01-24T06:34:00.000Z	karamazov		hi
2009-01-24T06:34:00.000Z	karamazov		does anybody know what ports do samba use?
2009-01-24T06:35:00.000Z	karamazov		what is 139?
2009-01-24T06:35:00.000Z	karamazov		the port?
2009-01-24T06:36:00.000Z	karamazov		it's using 4828
2009-01-24T06:36:00.000Z	karamazov		is it correct?
2009-01-24T06:36:00.000Z	Blackfate	karamazov	139/tcp open  netbios-ssn  and  445/tcp open  microsoft-ds
2009-01-24T06:37:00.000Z	karamazov	Blackfate	i run a ubuntu server in a virtualbox, so i have to forward these ports, right?
2009-01-24T06:37:00.000Z	Blackfate	karamazov	no need to do that
2009-01-24T06:37:00.000Z	karamazov	Blackfate	how should i do then
2009-01-24T06:38:00.000Z	Blackfate	karamazov	just configure the server properly  and you are done
2009-01-24T06:38:00.000Z	karamazov	Blackfate	ok thank you
2009-01-24T06:38:00.000Z	Blackfate	karamazov	dont mess with ports.. just play with the smb.conf
2009-01-24T06:58:00.000Z	karamazov	Blackfate	are you sure that i don't have to forward the ports?
