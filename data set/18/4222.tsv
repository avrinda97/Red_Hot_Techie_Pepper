2009-12-05T12:23:00.000Z	DexterLB		well yes but if you installed, add stuff, as acrobat wants a toolchain
2009-12-05T12:23:00.000Z	DexterLB		he'll need at least 1.5gb
2009-12-05T12:23:00.000Z	DexterLB		correct me if I'm wrong
2009-12-05T12:25:00.000Z	DexterLB		can someone help me? once again, my problem is: nautilus is showing ~ on the desktop instead of ~/Desktop
2009-12-05T12:25:00.000Z	DaZ	DexterLB	do you have ~/desktop folder?
2009-12-05T12:26:00.000Z	DexterLB	DaZ	yes I do
2009-12-05T12:30:00.000Z	DaZ	DexterLB	and desktop always displays correctly :F
2009-12-05T12:31:00.000Z	DexterLB	DaZ	yeah, but in my case the problem is in me I spose
2009-12-05T12:31:00.000Z	DaZ	DexterLB	why?
2009-12-05T12:31:00.000Z	DexterLB	DaZ	you see, I ran the nonautilus script
2009-12-05T12:31:00.000Z	DaZ	DexterLB	it's somewhere in gconf but i don't have gnome right now
2009-12-05T12:31:00.000Z	DexterLB	DaZ	then I ran it in reverse mode
2009-12-05T12:31:00.000Z	DaZ	DexterLB	what script? :f
2009-12-05T12:34:00.000Z	DaZ	DexterLB	you can always reinstall nautilus imo
2009-12-05T12:34:00.000Z	DexterLB	DaZ	how?
2009-12-05T12:34:00.000Z	DexterLB	DaZ	aptitude reinstall won't help for gconf I guess
2009-12-05T12:34:00.000Z	DaZ	DexterLB	it won't but this script does something in /usr
2009-12-05T12:35:00.000Z	DexterLB	DaZ	I'll try moving nautilus gconf thing to a backup location and doing an aptitude reinstall
