2012-05-10T16:36:00.000Z	fidel		!notunity
2012-05-10T16:38:00.000Z	fidel		just curious - or any problems?
2012-05-10T16:39:00.000Z	fidel		gui's are never sexy ;)
2012-05-10T16:40:00.000Z	DeltaHeavy	fidel	At least in Linux lol
2012-05-10T16:40:00.000Z	fidel	DeltaHeavy	no - its software..software cant look sexy
2012-05-10T16:40:00.000Z	DeltaHeavy	fidel	I found GNOME 2 to be far more usable than GNOME 2 fallback mode
2012-05-10T16:41:00.000Z	DeltaHeavy	fidel	I'm just saying compared to Windows and Mac Linux is pretty far behind in the world of GUI.
2012-05-10T16:42:00.000Z	fidel	DeltaHeavy	thats pretty personal isnt it - and somehow way offtopic aswell ;)
2012-05-10T16:42:00.000Z	DeltaHeavy	fidel	I don't know how expressing my dislike of Linux's GUI enviroments is personal lol
2012-05-10T16:45:00.000Z	fidel	DeltaHeavy	not 1:1 a clone - but ever considered xfce?
2012-05-10T16:46:00.000Z	DeltaHeavy	fidel	Yeah, I remember hearing about something called cinnominx or something of the sort. Or also something called Trent but the googler has popped up nothing on that one.
2012-05-10T16:47:00.000Z	fidel	DeltaHeavy	maybe worth a look: http://www.xfce.org/
2012-06-18T16:30:00.000Z	fidel	DeltaHeavy	so you are running several distris on that same hardware? just wondering
2012-06-18T16:30:00.000Z	fidel	DeltaHeavy	sure you do have some current gfx-drivers?
2012-06-18T16:30:00.000Z	DeltaHeavy	fidel	I have CentOS on here too. Also where would I check for that? Update don't say anything for that and this machine just has integrated graphics.
2012-06-18T16:31:00.000Z	fidel	DeltaHeavy	the gfx-driver as possible reason was just a quick idea
2012-06-18T16:32:00.000Z	DeltaHeavy	fidel	Well CentOS is working fine on here so I'm assuming this is an Ubuntu problem considering it's fairly different compared to most other distros
