2012-11-06T01:07:00.000Z	purvesh		can some one help me out installing ubuntu 12.10 with 2nd hard disk on my Ultrabook, should i turn off UEFI or not?
2012-11-06T01:09:00.000Z	snoozie	purvesh	after googling i find that to be a personal preference option
2012-11-06T01:10:00.000Z	purvesh	snoozie	so i could install with bios mod even ?
2012-11-06T01:13:00.000Z	snoozie	purvesh	that is generally recommended, but then some people choose not to use a swap when they have that much ram
2012-11-06T01:13:00.000Z	purvesh	snoozie	ohk...
2012-11-06T01:14:00.000Z	purvesh	snoozie	so if i would not create swap if i have 8gb ram on my laptop why should waste 8gb on swap, it is not going to use even?
2012-11-06T01:15:00.000Z	snoozie	purvesh	exactly my point, you would only need to have the swap if you plan to over tax your system resources
2012-11-06T01:16:00.000Z	purvesh	snoozie	so if i have 8gb ram how much should i allot swat size ?
2012-11-06T01:30:00.000Z	snoozie	purvesh	use an 8GB swap if you want to be able to hibernate
2012-11-06T01:34:00.000Z	purvesh	snoozie	is this method is perfect for UEFI ? http://www.linuxbsdos.com/2012/10/10/dual-boot-windows-7-and-ubuntu-12-04-on-a-pc-with-uefi-board-ssd-and-hdd/
2012-11-06T01:37:00.000Z	snoozie	purvesh	im no expert on the topic (never had uefi system) i got those answers from googling
2012-11-06T01:37:00.000Z	purvesh	snoozie	ok not an issue, thanks for helping !
