2006-12-05T07:29:00.000Z	anders__		hello, i'm trying to play enemy territory on ubuntu 6.10 i386, i have installed the game and i have tried to start the game, but it only manages to set screen resolution to very low, then fails with: "GLimp_Init() - could not load OpenGL" all i have found using google was a german site and i don't speak german :-(
2006-12-05T07:29:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	anders__	what graphics card drivers are you using?
2006-12-05T07:33:00.000Z	anders__	nolimitsoya	nv driver in xorg.conf
2006-12-05T07:34:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	anders__	'sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx && sudo nvidia-glx-config'
2006-12-05T07:34:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	anders__	cut and paste that to a terminal
2006-12-05T07:35:00.000Z	anders__	nolimitsoya	nvidia-glx is already the newest version.
2006-12-05T07:35:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	anders__	yes, but is nvidia-glx-config run?
2006-12-05T07:44:00.000Z	anders__	nolimitsoya	$ sudo /usr/sbin/nvidia-glx-config enable says "Error: unable to load nvidia kernel driver! Be sure to have installed the nvidia driver for your running kernel." but i have installed nvidia-glx...
2006-12-05T07:46:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	anders__	'sudo apt-get install kernel-headers-'uname -r'
2006-12-05T07:46:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	anders__	sorry, 'sudo apt-get install kernel-headers-`uname -r`'
2006-12-05T07:47:00.000Z	anders__	nolimitsoya	thanks, but i get "E: Couldn't find package kernel-headers-2.6.17-10-generic"
2006-12-05T07:48:00.000Z	anders__	nolimitsoya	i'm doing something wrong(?)
2006-12-05T07:49:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	anders__	ah, they might still be called linux-headers for you. :) running dapper?
2006-12-05T07:49:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	anders__	try 'sudo apt-get install linux-headers-`uname -r`' instead
2006-12-05T07:52:00.000Z	anders__	nolimitsoya	running edgy i386
2006-12-05T07:53:00.000Z	anders__	nolimitsoya	runnning "sudo apt-get install linux-headers-`uname -r`" outputs "linux-headers-2.6.17-10-generic is already the newest version."
2006-12-05T07:58:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	anders__	did you run nvidia-glx-config as i asked you? did you restart x?
2006-12-05T07:58:00.000Z	anders__	nolimitsoya	yes but it failed to start
