2007-04-28T06:01:00.000Z	olinuxx	Slart	but us428control don't launch ...
2007-04-28T06:01:00.000Z	Slart	olinuxx	ouch..haven't messed with that.. can't help you.. but perhaps someone else can
2007-04-28T06:01:00.000Z	olinuxx	Slart	;) thankx
2007-04-28T06:02:00.000Z	Slart	olinuxx	perhaps you might be better off asking in some other channel... isn't udev used in other distros aswell? perhaps there is an udev-specific channel out there
2007-04-28T06:05:00.000Z	olinuxx	Slart	yes but i don't find where is the #udev chan ;)
2007-04-28T06:07:00.000Z	Slart	olinuxx	mm.. I did a little searching on the net.. you've read the howtos on udev rules I assume?
2007-04-28T06:08:00.000Z	olinuxx	Slart	yes one or two, but english is not my cup of tea ;)
2007-04-28T06:08:00.000Z	olinuxx	Slart	maybe i've to read more !
2007-04-28T06:08:00.000Z	Slart	olinuxx	ouch.. I didn't see any translations.. sorry
2007-04-28T06:11:00.000Z	olinuxx	Slart	hehehe, i found  ;)
