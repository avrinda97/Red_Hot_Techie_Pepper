2012-02-16T09:59:00.000Z	ndkelly		I guess you're running XP
2012-02-16T09:59:00.000Z	ndkelly		?
2012-02-16T10:00:00.000Z	ndkelly		Nothing wrong with that. It's a solid release. Anyway, XP of all things should play nicely with Ubuntu, as it's one of the oldest Dual Boot OS's out there
2012-02-16T10:02:00.000Z	ndkelly		Measure twice, cut once. as my dad says.
2012-02-16T10:04:00.000Z	ndkelly		And it paid off.
2012-02-16T10:04:00.000Z	ndkelly		Not only will you get it working, but you'll have the knowledge of how to fix it
2012-02-16T10:06:00.000Z	ndkelly		Which is a pain for me to acquire another bootable USB as i don't own a mac.
2012-02-16T10:06:00.000Z	ndkelly		Not for this netbook.
2012-02-16T10:06:00.000Z	ndkelly		netbooks dont have optical drives either.
2012-02-16T10:07:00.000Z	ndkelly		yes
2012-02-16T10:07:00.000Z	damo22	ndkelly	buy the retail osx disk and roll your own install usb
2012-02-16T10:07:00.000Z	ndkelly		oops.
2012-02-16T10:08:00.000Z	ndkelly		I intend to. But i need access to a genuine mac before i can make it. It never worked before in Linux or Windows.
2012-02-16T10:08:00.000Z	damo22	ndkelly	i rolled one from linux
2012-02-16T10:09:00.000Z	ndkelly		really? I couldnt get mine to work.
2012-02-16T10:09:00.000Z	damo22	ndkelly	google nawcom
2012-02-16T10:09:00.000Z	ndkelly		It just seems to work better from a genuine mac. It's not impossible for me to get access to one, just selective.
2012-02-16T10:10:00.000Z	ndkelly	damo22	have done. shall look into it, thanks
