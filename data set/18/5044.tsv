2009-05-21T18:33:00.000Z	rCX		Where are terminal programs installed in ubuntu?
2009-05-21T18:34:00.000Z	kdub	rCX	/usr/bin/gnome-terminal is the default
2009-05-21T18:35:00.000Z	rCX	kdub	Thx
2009-05-21T18:35:00.000Z	kdub	rCX	more generally 'which ${programname}' will tell you where any executable on your $PATH lives
2009-05-21T18:40:00.000Z	rCX	kdub	Ok.  If I have a compiler in a folder where should I install it?
2009-05-21T18:40:00.000Z	kdub	rCX	i dont know what you mean by that
2009-05-21T18:41:00.000Z	kdub	rCX	are you trying to build and install a custom compiler?
2009-05-21T18:42:00.000Z	rCX	kdub	I'm trying to install fasm, (http://flatassembler.net),an assembler
2009-05-21T18:43:00.000Z	rCX	kdub	No, I actually have the folder and executable
2009-05-21T18:44:00.000Z	kdub	rCX	if you run it in the local folder, does it work?
2009-05-21T18:45:00.000Z	kdub	rCX	also, do you sometimes go by rcxdude?
2009-05-21T18:45:00.000Z	rCX	kdub	no :p
2009-05-21T18:46:00.000Z	rCX	kdub	I havn't tried that yet.  But I want to add the program to the path
2009-05-21T18:46:00.000Z	rCX	kdub	...so i can execute it from any directory
2009-05-21T18:47:00.000Z	rCX	kdub	I'll try it now
2009-05-21T18:48:00.000Z	kdub	rCX	looks like it works, just copy it to /usr/bin
2009-05-21T18:48:00.000Z	kdub	rCX	i was just making sure that it was linked correctly to run on the system out of their tar
2009-05-21T18:49:00.000Z	rCX	kdub	Thanks for your help.  I think I know what to do now
