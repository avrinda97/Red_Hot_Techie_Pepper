2005-04-06T10:55:00.000Z	UnbuntuBaby		anyone know how to boot into single user mode?
2005-04-06T10:57:00.000Z	UnbuntuBaby		...i mean is there anyway of jumping to terminal from the Username |===| screen?
2005-04-06T10:57:00.000Z	UnbuntuBaby		on OSX you can type >console and jump straight to single user mode, whats the equivalent in Ubuntu?
2005-04-06T10:59:00.000Z	UnbuntuBaby		wierd this is that a root enforced password is asking me to change my password, then what i go to do this
2005-04-06T11:00:00.000Z	UnbuntuBaby		i get "too early to cahnge password"
2005-04-06T11:00:00.000Z	UnbuntuBaby		could the clock be wrong?
2005-04-06T11:02:00.000Z	UnbuntuBaby		exact pahraise im getting: "you much wait longer to change your password"
2005-04-06T11:02:00.000Z	UnbuntuBaby		how much longer?!
2005-04-06T11:02:00.000Z	queuetue	UnbuntuBaby	It says "you much wait longer"?  When you do what?
2005-04-06T11:04:00.000Z	queuetue	UnbuntuBaby	misspelled like that?
2005-04-06T11:05:00.000Z	queuetue	UnbuntuBaby	I think I'd reboot into single-user and remove whatever is giving you that message...
2005-04-06T11:06:00.000Z	UnbuntuBaby	queuetue	sounds like a fun idea, but this is my favourite laptop you see
2005-04-06T11:27:00.000Z	queuetue	UnbuntuBaby	I'd get a live CD - boot with that and have a fully functional distro to 'fix' with.
2005-04-06T11:36:00.000Z	queuetue	UnbuntuBaby	I've never seen a standard *ix install without vi ... other than SCO.
2005-04-06T11:37:00.000Z	queuetue	UnbuntuBaby	like gunzip + tar ?
2005-04-06T11:38:00.000Z	queuetue	UnbuntuBaby	or do you really want to unpack one of those dumb .sit files that people keep mailing me?
2005-04-06T11:39:00.000Z	UnbuntuBaby	queuetue	an aside point, any idea what the pwd command does?
2005-04-06T11:39:00.000Z	queuetue	UnbuntuBaby	prints the working directory?
