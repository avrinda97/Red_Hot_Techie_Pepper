2006-06-09T10:35:00.000Z	Warbo		If I want to add a factoid to ubotu, do I put the factoid in quotes or something (Wiki is not clear)
2006-06-09T10:37:00.000Z	Warbo		!eagleusb
2006-06-09T10:37:00.000Z	Warbo		Hmmm. Almost :)

2006-06-09T10:40:00.000Z	Warbo		AA! ubotu's time limits!
2006-06-09T10:40:00.000Z	ic56	Warbo	what's your problem with ubotu?
2006-06-09T10:41:00.000Z	Warbo	ic56	Doesn't matter
2006-06-09T10:42:00.000Z	ic56	Warbo	why don't you talk to ubotu through private messages?
2006-06-09T10:42:00.000Z	Warbo	ic56	It's done now
2006-07-07T16:58:00.000Z	Warbo	ic56	In the Profiles dialog
2006-07-07T16:58:00.000Z	ic56	Warbo	where is the Profiles dialog?
2006-07-07T05:01:00.000Z	Warbo	ic56	Edit menu?
2006-07-07T05:02:00.000Z	ic56	Warbo	where is the Edit menu?  Sorry, I'm feeling so GUI-clueless!
2006-07-07T05:03:00.000Z	Warbo	ic56	At the top of the window?
2006-07-07T05:07:00.000Z	ic56	Warbo	ok, found it.  To change the font colour in gnome Terminal, right click within the terminal window, then choose "edit current profile", a window pops-up.  Go to "Colours" tab.  Your Terminal probably has task icons at the top.  I always disable these to get more screen real estate.  Thx for the help, Warbo
2006-07-07T05:08:00.000Z	Warbo	ic56	Coming in here with your customised configs then wondering where the buttons are, some people :)
2006-07-07T05:10:00.000Z	ic56	Warbo	I know... :-)  The trouble is, it's easy to forget what customizations you've done -- especially if you've been doing them consistently over the years.  Even when icons are present on the screen, I'm likely to not see them when looking for functionality :-(
