2010-06-01T02:20:00.000Z	greezmunkey	christopher	sudo Xorg -configure - then sudo mv ~/xorg.conf.new /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2010-06-01T02:24:00.000Z	greezmunkey	christopher	your home directory
2010-06-01T02:25:00.000Z	greezmunkey	christopher	thus ~/xorg.conf.net ...
2010-06-01T02:29:00.000Z	greezmunkey	christopher	sudo mv ~/xorg.conf.new /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2010-06-01T02:32:00.000Z	greezmunkey	christopher	try this: ls -l /home/christopher/xorg.conf.new
2010-06-01T02:34:00.000Z	greezmunkey	christopher	I don't know then - something wierd on your system, I guess. If the file exists, you should be able to move it - especially with sudo, unless you've borked something completely.
2010-06-01T02:35:00.000Z	greezmunkey	christopher	you are on ubuntu right??
2010-06-01T02:35:00.000Z	greezmunkey	christopher	this is not a xubuntu support channel, sorry.
2010-06-01T02:38:00.000Z	greezmunkey	christopher	did you run the command that you were given earlier - touch etc etc etc?
2010-06-01T02:39:00.000Z	greezmunkey	christopher	I was going to ask that guy why he would give you a command that would only create an empty file on your system, but didn't have time.
2010-06-01T02:58:00.000Z	greezmunkey	christopher	How are you logged in
