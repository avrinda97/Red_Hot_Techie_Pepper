2009-11-17T01:07:00.000Z	pokobook		im trying to divide a drive half for windows data and the other half for ubuntu there is no such option in 9.10 installation.
2009-11-17T01:08:00.000Z	pokobook		im blindly trying based on luck and see if it works out
2009-11-17T01:08:00.000Z	histo	pokobook	manual partitioning
2009-11-17T01:09:00.000Z	histo	pokobook	don't use guided
2009-11-17T01:09:00.000Z	pokobook	histo	thats what im trying to do now
2009-11-17T01:09:00.000Z	histo	pokobook	well the option is there.
2009-11-17T01:10:00.000Z	pokobook	histo	: already created 3000mb swap not too sure how to divide the rest
2009-11-17T01:11:00.000Z	histo	pokobook	you said you wanted half for ubuntu and half for windows right?
2009-11-17T01:12:00.000Z	histo	pokobook	also I would install windows first. but thats another issue.
2009-11-17T01:14:00.000Z	histo	pokobook	okay do you want a seperate /home partition?
2009-11-17T01:15:00.000Z	histo	pokobook	okay well put about 20gigs for /  ext4 .  Then create the remainder of the half for /home ext4.  Then use the remainder of the drive as fat32 or ntfs if you want.
2009-11-17T01:18:00.000Z	histo	pokobook	you can even get away with using 10 gigs for / but you want the biggest portion to be for you /home.  thats where all your files media etc... get stored. / is just for system files and installed software.
2009-11-17T01:19:00.000Z	histo	pokobook	yes?
2009-11-17T01:20:00.000Z	histo	pokobook	np
2009-11-17T01:22:00.000Z	histo	pokobook	the other thing to keep in mind if you reinstall you just have the new system installed to / and you tell it to use your old /home as the current /home then all your files and settings will be saved.
