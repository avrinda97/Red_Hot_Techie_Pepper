2008-07-13T21:44:00.000Z	Bubulle	Syberjj	you can't remote 3D sotfware like your game
2008-07-13T21:46:00.000Z	Bubulle	Syberjj	wonder why 3D chips whant to achieve gigabits/s of memory thansfer and you want this to cross some few megabits of a network link?
2008-07-13T21:50:00.000Z	Bubulle	Syberjj	I am able to chat, with Wow running with Wine or Cedega, and compiz effects allow me nice switchs from the game to Ubuntu native programs such as chat
2008-07-13T21:54:00.000Z	Bubulle	Syberjj	I use wine and Wow and compiz togather without problems.
2008-07-13T21:54:00.000Z	Bubulle	Syberjj	look at my recorded Wow on Linux here: http://www.noiraude.net/videos/wow-linux-bery.ogg
2008-07-13T21:59:00.000Z	Bubulle	Syberjj	no way to remote the 3D windows unless you get software rendering and then it slow to the point you won't be able to do anything
2008-07-13T22:03:00.000Z	Bubulle	Syberjj	did you try teleport, a kind of software KVM, that let move mous and keyboard across computers?
2008-07-13T22:04:00.000Z	Bubulle	Syberjj	it won't display Wow remotely but will let you type and act mouse remotely
2008-07-13T22:06:00.000Z	Bubulle	Syberjj	I don't use VNC but freenx and ncxlient from nomachine software. This has better performance ahtn VNC, Did you try it?
2008-07-13T22:09:00.000Z	Bubulle	Syberjj	There is a setting I do'nt remember to allow replication 3D applications. I used it with Blender. If you can get glxgears to display on a NX remote, it will do for wow.
2008-07-13T22:10:00.000Z	Bubulle	Syberjj	Blender is a 3D editing and rendering software
2008-07-13T22:11:00.000Z	Bubulle	Syberjj	yes, very slowly
2008-07-13T22:11:00.000Z	Bubulle	Syberjj	you can test and debug remote 3D with glxgears (simpler)
2008-07-13T22:12:00.000Z	Bubulle	Syberjj	an ENV variable to tells not to use 3D acceleration. Forgot about it
2008-07-13T22:14:00.000Z	Bubulle	Syberjj	in the environment variables
