2011-04-17T11:00:00.000Z	pfifo	gaelfx	i would say tarball it and burn it to a cd, unless it is huge then rsync over a network becomes an otpiton
2011-04-17T11:01:00.000Z	gaelfx	pfifo	way too huge for tarring and burning, ca I rsync if I put them both in the same machine?
2011-04-17T11:02:00.000Z	pfifo	gaelfx	if you can move both drives to the same machine then the copy command is the easiest
2011-04-17T11:02:00.000Z	gaelfx	pfifo	will that take care of hidden files and whatnot?
2011-04-17T11:05:00.000Z	pfifo	gaelfx	with the correct switch, i usually do `sudo cp -a /home/pfifo /mnt/pfifo` you could also leave offf the username to copy more than one user
2011-04-17T11:06:00.000Z	pfifo	gaelfx	rsync is perfectly fine if your already familiar
2011-04-18T05:31:00.000Z	pfifo	gaelfx	what borders?
2011-04-18T05:32:00.000Z	gaelfx	pfifo	the ones with the control buttons, close, mini, maxi
2011-04-18T05:32:00.000Z	pfifo	gaelfx	look in your themes settings see if theres anything it can do to restore them.
2011-04-18T05:33:00.000Z	gaelfx	pfifo	I'll look at the customize options, thanks
2011-04-18T06:20:00.000Z	pfifo	gaelfx	no its actuall going to tak up a bit more space too
2011-04-18T06:22:00.000Z	gaelfx	pfifo	is it a noticeable difference? or just megs?
2011-04-18T06:23:00.000Z	pfifo	gaelfx	i think it is 8MB per partition
2011-05-14T12:04:00.000Z	pfifo	gaelfx	its probbally the dock I have to ask "Does it work in windows"
2011-05-14T12:05:00.000Z	gaelfx	pfifo	I've not used it in windows
2011-05-14T12:05:00.000Z	pfifo	gaelfx	afaik scsi emulation supports smart, so it should work
