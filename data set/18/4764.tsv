2009-05-08T08:26:00.000Z	vimpulse	jasonmchristos	 what is cloud computing?
2009-05-08T08:28:00.000Z	vimpulse	jasonmchristos	 you should take a linux administration course before you ask us about cloud computing.
2009-05-08T08:31:00.000Z	vimpulse	jasonmchristos	 are you a sysadmin?
2009-05-08T08:33:00.000Z	vimpulse	jasonmchristos	 are you a sysadmin?
2009-05-08T08:33:00.000Z	jasonmchristos	vimpulse	I am my own sysadmin
2009-05-08T08:34:00.000Z	jasonmchristos	vimpulse	and the sys admin of a few individual clients
2009-05-08T08:34:00.000Z	vimpulse	jasonmchristos	 you're asking awfully vague questions :)
2009-05-08T08:34:00.000Z	jasonmchristos	vimpulse	no it wasn't very nague at all just the answers I was getting were vague NONE OF WHICH CAME FROM YOU
2009-05-08T08:35:00.000Z	jasonmchristos	vimpulse	I wouldn't dare ask you a programming question vim
2009-05-08T08:36:00.000Z	jasonmchristos	vimpulse	see I have customer service skills that's why I will get linux on more computers than you while you just "code for food"
2009-05-08T08:37:00.000Z	jasonmchristos	vimpulse	I get that new money , what you get is that "trickle down effect" from me
2009-05-08T08:37:00.000Z	vimpulse	jasonmchristos	 there is no competition for who can install ubuntu on the most PCs.  When people ask me what to use for home computing, I sometimes recommend Windows.
2009-05-08T08:37:00.000Z	jasonmchristos	vimpulse	ok keep reccomending windows and giving microsoft 100 bucks while I pocket that and then some
2009-05-08T08:38:00.000Z	jasonmchristos	vimpulse	my competition is with whose wallet is fatter,, want to play "big wallet little wallet"?
2009-05-08T08:38:00.000Z	vimpulse	jasonmchristos	 pici already said we are offtopic.
2009-05-08T08:38:00.000Z	jasonmchristos	vimpulse	do you know how to play?
