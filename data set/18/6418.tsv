2008-05-20T01:18:00.000Z	Vlet	ringer	boot off the CD
2008-05-20T01:21:00.000Z	ringer	Vlet	then it will give me the option to reinstall? do i just click Install?
2008-05-20T01:21:00.000Z	Vlet	ringer	yes
2008-05-20T01:21:00.000Z	ringer	Vlet	okay doing that right now
2008-05-20T01:22:00.000Z	Vlet	ringer	but you should try to back up any info you need to keep
2008-05-20T01:23:00.000Z	ringer	Vlet	it isnt giving me an option to reinstall, just install
2008-05-20T01:27:00.000Z	Vlet	ringer	so, install - what's the difference
2008-05-20T01:27:00.000Z	ringer	Vlet	i have an xp partition i want to keep
2008-05-20T01:28:00.000Z	Vlet	ringer	okay?
2008-05-20T01:29:00.000Z	ringer	Vlet	well you see i want to get rid of the old 7.10, and it is only giving me an option to split the ext3 partition
2008-05-20T01:30:00.000Z	Vlet	ringer	so use 'manual' partitioning. You'll see a partition of the type 'ext3'. Check the 'format' option, and change it's mount location to "/" (without quotes)
2008-05-20T01:31:00.000Z	ringer	Vlet	okay, is that it?
2008-05-20T01:32:00.000Z	Vlet	ringer	yep. Make sure you DON'T check 'format' next to the NTFS partition; that should be it. It WILL however delete everything that was in your ubuntu system
2008-05-20T01:33:00.000Z	ringer	Vlet	okay, beauty.  thanks, ill let you know how it goes
