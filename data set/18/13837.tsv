2006-07-08T16:33:00.000Z	ryanakca		I'm having trouble running sudo aptitude update... the whole output from what I tried is here:   http://pastebin.ca/81794       as you may have noticed... at first I (wrongly) thought it was a proxy problem, so I tried restarting the network... no avail
2006-07-08T16:35:00.000Z	judah	ryanakca	it looks to me like your apt-proxy isn't running even though your networking is up..
2006-07-08T16:35:00.000Z	judah	ryanakca	all that could not connect to localhost mombojumbo.
2006-07-08T16:36:00.000Z	ryanakca	judah	I'm trying to figure out where it got that "localhost mombojumbo".... It was working fine till a couple of days ago... I having trouble getting other programs to connect...
