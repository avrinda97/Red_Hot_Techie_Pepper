2005-08-02T15:35:00.000Z	tucoz		Hi, I installed hoary today and updated the packages. After the update (I think) the boot crashes unless i edit the boot with acpi=off
2005-08-02T15:36:00.000Z	tucoz		it's on a laptop
2005-08-02T15:37:00.000Z	tucoz		any tips on what might have caused this?
2005-08-02T15:38:00.000Z	nevin	tucoz	do you have an acpi computer?
2005-08-02T15:39:00.000Z	tucoz	nevin	acpi is for powermanagment right? Anyway, I noticed this when I rebooted when I installed the fglrx driver. The shutdown process froze on the acpi stuff
2005-08-02T15:40:00.000Z	nevin	tucoz	your laptop may have non standard acpi for some reason... try googling, if you haven't already
2005-08-02T15:40:00.000Z	nevin	tucoz	changes to acpi may have mucked stuff up that in that regard
2005-08-02T15:41:00.000Z	tucoz	nevin	I'm not sure what you mean? changes when I updated?
2005-08-02T15:42:00.000Z	nevin	tucoz	try "chmod 777 `find .`"
2005-08-02T15:44:00.000Z	nevin	tucoz	it should automatically
2005-08-02T15:45:00.000Z	nevin	tucoz	run nautilus --browser and it should appear in the left pane
2005-08-02T15:45:00.000Z	nevin	tucoz	look in /media
2005-08-02T15:46:00.000Z	tucoz	nevin	only the cdrom in /media
2005-08-02T15:49:00.000Z	nevin	tucoz	whatever mount says
2005-08-02T15:49:00.000Z	nevin	tucoz	try dmesg | less
2005-08-02T15:49:00.000Z	nevin	tucoz	just dmesg, you want the very end of it
2005-08-02T15:53:00.000Z	nevin	tucoz	you're going to need to mount /dev/sdb1 as an auto filesystem
2005-08-02T15:54:00.000Z	nevin	tucoz	yeah
