2008-10-10T14:26:00.000Z	contarc		i am booted on rescue mode but i cannot write to /usr/sbin (install/remove packages).  any ideas how i can do this?  permissions are fine 755 and i am using user root
2008-10-10T14:26:00.000Z	ikonia	contarc	what is the error
2008-10-10T14:26:00.000Z	ikonia	contarc	the file system is probably mounted read only
2008-10-10T14:28:00.000Z	contarc	ikonia	it says permission denied.  it's not read only. i can write everywhere else but to /usr*
2008-10-10T14:29:00.000Z	ikonia	contarc	please put the output of mount in a pastebin please.

2008-10-10T15:42:00.000Z	contarc	ikonia	apologies.  it's what i was asking about before.   unable to create `./usr/sbin/sshd': Permission denied
2008-10-10T15:42:00.000Z	ikonia	contarc	I don't remember the actual question for earlier, sorry
2008-10-10T15:43:00.000Z	ikonia	contarc	ooh wait I do
2008-10-10T15:43:00.000Z	ikonia	contarc	ls- la /usr/sbin/sshd
2008-10-10T15:43:00.000Z	ikonia	contarc	ls -la /usr/sbin/sshd
2008-10-10T15:44:00.000Z	ikonia	contarc	Hmmm it already exists, have you tried remocing it
2008-10-10T15:48:00.000Z	contarc	ikonia	got it.  thanks for your help all.
2008-10-10T15:48:00.000Z	ikonia	contarc	could you explain the solution
2008-10-10T15:48:00.000Z	ikonia	contarc	I didn't quite pickup full on IntuitiveNipple's comment
