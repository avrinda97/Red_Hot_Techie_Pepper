2011-11-14T23:34:00.000Z	Jordan_U	blueblue2u	I would recommend *not* installing within Windows.
2011-11-14T23:41:00.000Z	Jordan_U	blueblue2u	You shouldn't generally need to in
2011-11-14T23:42:00.000Z	Jordan_U	blueblue2u	... need to install a bootloader manually. Ubuntu's installer will install grub properly.
2011-11-14T23:44:00.000Z	Jordan_U	blueblue2u	If you do install grub manually for some reason its boot sector should go in the mbr.
2011-11-14T23:44:00.000Z	Jordan_U	blueblue2u	I think you're making things more difficult than they need to be.
2011-11-14T23:45:00.000Z	Jordan_U	blueblue2u	That is not true.
2011-11-14T23:46:00.000Z	Jordan_U	blueblue2u	Please be patient, I have a lot to write ans I'm working from my phone.
2011-11-14T23:50:00.000Z	Jordan_U	blueblue2u	Could you wait a few minutes before doing anything so I can get to a normal computer + keyboard?
