2009-07-28T10:00:00.000Z	nanotube	stryker	also check audacious
2009-07-28T10:00:00.000Z	nanotube	stryker	audacious is very winamp-like
2009-07-28T10:04:00.000Z	nanotube	stryker	right click on file of type you want to make it default for, go to "open with" tab, select it.
2009-07-28T10:08:00.000Z	nanotube	stryker	maybe you don't have the codecs installed?
2009-07-28T10:08:00.000Z	nanotube	stryker	try looking at the medibuntu repository.... see below:
2009-07-28T10:09:00.000Z	stryker	nanotube	i think i installed the right codecs
2009-07-28T10:28:00.000Z	nanotube	stryker	screen doesn't turn on as in, not even for the bios?
2009-07-28T10:28:00.000Z	stryker	nanotube	no
2009-07-28T10:28:00.000Z	nanotube	stryker	wow, that's pretty serious...
2009-07-28T10:29:00.000Z	stryker	nanotube	he said it went black during the restart
2009-07-28T10:29:00.000Z	nanotube	stryker	if it went black during restart, that was even before the new driver was being used, so doubt that it's due to the new driver. probably just an unrelated hardware failure.
2009-07-28T10:31:00.000Z	stryker	nanotube	isee what you mean
2009-07-28T10:32:00.000Z	nanotube	stryker	mechtech: well, in that case, definitely not firmware.
2009-07-28T10:45:00.000Z	stryker	nanotube	mechtech: losher: he says that the computer stayed black after it had restarted, not while the restart
2009-07-28T10:45:00.000Z	stryker	nanotube	mechtech: losher: and now the monitor does not turn on at all
2009-07-28T10:46:00.000Z	nanotube	stryker	mechtech: losher: still, if it never even came up after the reboot, not ever to show the bios - that means it happened before the driver started to be used (which only happens once Xorg starts loading)
2009-07-28T10:47:00.000Z	stryker	nanotube	stryker: losher: okay, so it could be the monitor just died? he also says the HD is not responding
