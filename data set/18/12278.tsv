2007-01-10T14:47:00.000Z	keir	ikonia	there is no 686 image packages under edgy listed at all
2007-01-10T14:47:00.000Z	keir	ikonia	nope

2008-01-26T02:52:00.000Z	ikonia	keir	no it doesn't
2008-01-26T02:53:00.000Z	ikonia	keir	the problem is adobe
2008-01-26T02:53:00.000Z	ikonia	keir	all the other distros have the same problem
2008-01-26T02:53:00.000Z	ikonia	keir	comments like that make you look bad
2008-01-26T02:53:00.000Z	ikonia	keir	don't be silly

2008-01-26T02:53:00.000Z	ikonia	keir	its not md5 sums
2008-01-26T02:53:00.000Z	ikonia	keir	which shows how little you understand. Don't be so quick to pass comments
2008-01-26T02:55:00.000Z	ikonia	keir	it's NOT ubuntu's issue
2008-01-26T02:55:00.000Z	keir	ikonia	can you enlighten me? if i can install via adobe.com, it seems to me that a official ubuntu install script should work too.
2008-01-26T02:56:00.000Z	ikonia	keir	no - there is more to it thatn md5 checksums
2008-01-26T02:56:00.000Z	keir	ikonia	ok
