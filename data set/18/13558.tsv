2005-11-03T13:58:00.000Z	absent	jesse__	i should have already installed it but i dont know where to find it, i am new to linux and i keep looking for the "program files" folder
2005-11-03T13:59:00.000Z	jesse__	absent	assuming you installed it correctly, you should look for it in your "Applications" menu. if its not there, try running it from the console. if you are still having problems, i will need to know the program :)
