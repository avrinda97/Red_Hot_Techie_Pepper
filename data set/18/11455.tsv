2009-04-27T03:33:00.000Z	Cammy		Heya everyone :)
2009-04-27T03:34:00.000Z	Cammy		I've just installed Ubuntu and it looks and feels fantastic
2009-04-27T03:35:00.000Z	Cammy		I was wondering if anyone could help me out with something, I don't have write access to the usr/share/ folder
2009-04-27T03:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Cammy	yes you won't have by default
2009-04-27T03:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Cammy	just of interest, why do you want to?
2009-04-27T03:37:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Cammy	you can  do what you want via commandline some how
2009-04-27T03:37:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Cammy	or pretty easilly graphicalley
2009-04-27T03:38:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Cammy	also  it helps to type the first few letters of someones name  and then pressing tab for auto complete
2009-04-27T03:38:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Cammy	since hte ot her guy might have missed you asking what chmod is
2009-04-27T03:38:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Cammy	the other guy
2009-04-27T03:41:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Cammy	ok  uhmm
2009-04-27T03:41:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Cammy	basic graphical and command stuff yeah
2009-04-27T03:41:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Cammy	chmod  I woudn't consider  a commandline basic, but sudo sure
2009-04-27T03:41:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Cammy	the amsn theme,  what  format is it in.  tar.gz???
2009-04-27T03:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Cammy	normalley when you install a program you  put.   sudo  apt-get install  programname into the terminal,  and it gets it  off the Ubuntu server/repo
2009-04-27T03:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Cammy	,but you were talking about putting in the usr folder  so  you won't sudo your theme in that case
2009-04-27T03:44:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Cammy	ok what  file format is it in?
2009-04-27T03:47:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Cammy	cspack has a point /usr   is  for more than one user,  and   the hidden  amsn folder is for each user
