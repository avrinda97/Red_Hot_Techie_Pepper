2011-05-29T18:23:00.000Z	BorgTK2001	lucky_star	Are you looking to prevent a hack attempt, or have you already got the feeling you have been hacked?
2011-05-29T18:23:00.000Z	BorgTK2001	lucky_star	no troubles :)
2011-05-29T18:27:00.000Z	BorgTK2001	lucky_star	The key part here is that now you have been helped, take some time to learn the Ubuntu ropes, then comeback and help your fellow humans with Ubuntu issues :)

2011-05-29T18:36:00.000Z	BorgTK2001	lucky_star	I'm not one to push distros, but make sure you wait for Ubuntu 12.04LTS - it should be special.
