2012-09-16T06:06:00.000Z	WACOMalt		I didn't will check there, thanks
2012-09-16T06:08:00.000Z	WACOMalt		OK um... In Ubuntu software center if I click to install anything it spits a windows saying I need to authenticate, it shows up for amplit second shaking like crazy then goes away any my software doesn't install

2012-09-16T06:09:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	WACOMalt	try apt-get and see if a missing key shows.
2012-09-16T06:11:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	WACOMalt	you can only use the software center or apt-get individually not at the same time

2012-09-17T06:46:00.000Z	WACOMalt	wilee-nilee	ok I am still a bit confused how to change the current mount for this drive into ntfs
2012-09-17T06:48:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	WACOMalt	use the line shoiwn with the correct drive and partition I would think.
2012-09-17T06:50:00.000Z	WACOMalt	wilee-nilee	my /etc/fstab/ file does not have this mount listed at all
2012-09-17T06:50:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	WACOMalt	okay make one it the only ones loaded automatically are the OS.
2012-09-17T06:51:00.000Z	WACOMalt	wilee-nilee	but the drive IS currently mounted, just not listed here. How can I make sure it wont be trying to mount twice?
2012-09-17T06:51:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	WACOMalt	How is it mounting now?
2012-09-17T06:52:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	WACOMalt	Plugged in when booting or sudo mount /dev/sdx /mnt the other way
2012-09-17T06:52:00.000Z	WACOMalt	wilee-nilee	it's an internal drive, so always mounted. I dont plug it in or anything
2012-09-17T06:53:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	WACOMalt	Hmm, not sure then myself I don't have anything automounting and a single HD
2012-09-17T06:55:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	WACOMalt	I wonder if its in the fstab are you sure its not?
