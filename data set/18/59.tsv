2012-11-10T22:29:00.000Z	cyberflyz		i changed my vps ubuntu server time zone to Asia/Kuala_Lumpur. but it shows the wrong time zone. it shows 2 hours faster. how to fix this?
2012-11-10T22:29:00.000Z	ikonia	cyberflyz	is it syncing from ntp ?
2012-11-10T22:29:00.000Z	ikonia	cyberflyz	did you reboot after changing the time ?
2012-11-10T22:29:00.000Z	ikonia	cyberflyz	is it taking the time from the hardware clock of the physical host /
2012-11-10T22:30:00.000Z	cyberflyz	ikonia	: i dont understand
2012-11-10T22:30:00.000Z	ikonia	cyberflyz	are you using ntp yes/no ?
2012-11-10T22:31:00.000Z	ikonia	cyberflyz	ok, so check the ntp source
2012-11-10T22:46:00.000Z	ikonia	cyberflyz	you are using ntp - so you need to check the ntp source
2012-11-10T22:46:00.000Z	ikonia	cyberflyz	as I told you earlier
2012-11-10T22:47:00.000Z	ikonia	cyberflyz	what /
2012-11-10T22:48:00.000Z	ikonia	cyberflyz	how did you setup ntp ?
2012-11-10T22:50:00.000Z	ikonia	cyberflyz	you don't know ?? why did you say "yes" when I asked if you where using ntp if you don't know
2012-11-10T22:51:00.000Z	ikonia	cyberflyz	the time maybe locked by your vps provider
2012-11-10T22:51:00.000Z	ikonia	cyberflyz	can you show me the output of "uname -a" please.
2012-11-10T22:52:00.000Z	ikonia	cyberflyz	ok, so it's a custom install, it's possible/probible that the time is being set by the host, your VPS provider should be able to resolve that
2012-11-10T22:57:00.000Z	ikonia	cyberflyz	that's not what I told you to do
2012-11-10T22:57:00.000Z	ikonia	cyberflyz	I told you to contact your VPS provider
