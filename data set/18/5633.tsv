2010-07-29T08:51:00.000Z	Izinucs	DasEi	A-Non the right driver may be the 96.xx driver not the 195.xx
2010-07-29T08:51:00.000Z	DasEi	Izinucs	I just see that, that's xorg 1.7
2010-07-29T08:52:00.000Z	Izinucs	DasEi	what's 10.04 running 1.7 or 1.8?  I think Maverick is 1.8
2010-07-29T08:53:00.000Z	DasEi	Izinucs	Version: 1:7.5+5ubuntu1, so not as 1.8 as said above, for lucid
2010-07-29T08:54:00.000Z	Izinucs	DasEi	A-Non this is what I found http://www.nvidia.com/object/linux_display_ia32_173.14.25.html
2010-07-29T08:55:00.000Z	DasEi	Izinucs	same here
2010-07-29T08:55:00.000Z	Izinucs	DasEi	and 10.04 is 1.7?
2010-07-29T08:55:00.000Z	DasEi	Izinucs	as apt says, yes
2010-07-29T08:56:00.000Z	Izinucs	DasEi	don't forget that the stock nvidia drivers that come with ubuntu have to be uninstalled prior to installing the binary..
2010-07-29T08:56:00.000Z	Izinucs	DasEi	also the headers need installing
2010-07-29T09:00:00.000Z	Izinucs	DasEi	I'm not even sure what jockey is.. :/
2010-07-29T09:02:00.000Z	Izinucs	DasEi	but does removing that eliminate the other nvidia bits provided by ubuntu?
2010-07-29T09:03:00.000Z	Izinucs	DasEi	I've had a horrible time installing the binary on 10.04 but from 6.06 through 9.1 it was pretty simple.. maybe something to do with the new opensource driver being the default.
2010-07-29T09:04:00.000Z	Izinucs	DasEi	by the way.. You're not highlighting me with my nick.. it's izinucs not lzinucs :)
2010-07-29T09:05:00.000Z	DasEi	Izinucs	aharr :) was about to plaster my tab, hehe
2010-07-29T09:05:00.000Z	Izinucs	DasEi	it's actually my normal nick backwards.. different machine .. different nick
2010-07-29T09:11:00.000Z	DasEi	Izinucs	I just wonder about if the 185 would also support an fx 5500
2010-09-01T04:44:00.000Z	Izinucs	DasEi	k.. didn't catch the previous part of the conversation
