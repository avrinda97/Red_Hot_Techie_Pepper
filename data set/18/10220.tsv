2006-12-31T07:03:00.000Z	Theodor		When I plug in my external hdd using USB port, what does it mount? What's the path ?
2006-12-31T07:04:00.000Z	Theodor		I can put that path to the /etc/apt/sources.list so I can use my external hdd for apt-get, yes ?
2006-12-31T07:05:00.000Z	Theodor		what does dpkg has to do with apt-get ?
2006-12-31T07:06:00.000Z	plyp_werk	Theodor	dpkg is the program that installs and removes packages.  apt-get is the one for downloading them, but the it will use dpkg in the background
2006-12-31T07:06:00.000Z	Theodor	plyp_werk	thanks.
2006-12-31T07:06:00.000Z	plyp_werk	Theodor	so if you already have the packages downloaded, you can use dpkg -i package.deb to manually install
2006-12-31T07:07:00.000Z	plyp_werk	Theodor	oh, so the DVD has a repository of all sorts of packages on it?
2006-12-31T07:07:00.000Z	Theodor	plyp_werk	it's the Ubuntu DVD.
2006-12-31T07:09:00.000Z	plyp_werk	Theodor	but since you have a real repository with the right helper files, then apt-get will work
2006-12-31T07:09:00.000Z	plyp_werk	Theodor	ya, one second...let me look it up
2006-12-31T07:12:00.000Z	plyp_werk	Theodor	ok, you see the other entries in sources.list that start with "deb http://"?
2006-12-31T07:13:00.000Z	plyp_werk	Theodor	yours should look like those, except with "file" instead of "http"
2006-12-31T07:13:00.000Z	Theodor	plyp_werk	thanks man. I will try it now.
2006-12-31T07:13:00.000Z	Theodor	plyp_werk	how can I open the file from the terminal in order to change it ?
2006-12-31T07:17:00.000Z	plyp_werk	Theodor	you only want certain specific packages?
2006-12-31T07:18:00.000Z	Theodor	plyp_werk	I need like 4 .. I was trying to install Alien earlier and I couldn't as I was missing some packages.
2006-12-31T07:20:00.000Z	plyp_werk	Theodor	you could just hunt through the directories for the specific .debs
2006-12-31T07:20:00.000Z	plyp_werk	Theodor	they should be in a "pool" directory somewhere, then sorted alphabetically
