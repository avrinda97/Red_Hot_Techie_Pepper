2010-06-21T17:08:00.000Z	Taev		why is Gparted telling me to boot to windows to run chkdsk
2010-06-21T17:08:00.000Z	Taev		is there no linux equivalent?
2010-06-21T17:09:00.000Z	Taev		yeah
2010-06-21T17:09:00.000Z	Taev		its an NTFS partition
2010-06-21T17:09:00.000Z	Taev		when I try and resize it, it tells me there is at least 1 bad sector
2010-06-21T17:09:00.000Z	Taev		and to boot to windows and run chkdsk
2010-06-21T17:10:00.000Z	erUSUL	Taev	the closest thing is ntfsfix from ntfsprogs
2010-06-21T17:12:00.000Z	erUSUL	Taev	it makes sense; to fix a MS filesystem use MS tools. they know it better than anyone.
2010-06-21T17:13:00.000Z	erUSUL	Taev	why would anyone use raid0 ? double the risk of data loss for what gain?
2010-07-17T15:16:00.000Z	erUSUL	Taev	/etc/rc.local for system wide things ;
2010-07-17T15:20:00.000Z	erUSUL	Taev	also; those tightvncserver -basehttpport 8083 :1 need the x window system to have started ? the user session ?
2010-07-17T15:25:00.000Z	erUSUL	Taev	yes
2010-07-17T15:38:00.000Z	erUSUL	Taev	pur-ftp should have its own init script in /etc/init.d/ or use inetd
2010-08-02T15:38:00.000Z	erUSUL	Taev	the launch creation dialog has a tick box for that iirc
2010-08-02T15:39:00.000Z	erUSUL	Taev	no problem
2010-08-02T15:44:00.000Z	erUSUL	Taev	the propietary driver wont support old hardware
2010-08-02T15:49:00.000Z	erUSUL	Taev	no; you can use screen to run the program dettach from it. then go to the other pc connect via ssh to the first pc and attach again to the screen session but the program will be executting in the first pc
2010-08-02T16:03:00.000Z	erUSUL	Taev	yes
