2009-02-09T20:40:00.000Z	jla		Hi. I'm checking out ubuntu and having trouble using Add/Remove or Synaptic to find programs to install. For example crossfire. I type that into the search for add/remove and it finds nothing.
2009-02-09T20:41:00.000Z	kjell	jla	What do you search for
2009-02-09T20:41:00.000Z	kjell	jla	Have you choosen "All applications" to the left of the searchbox?
2009-02-09T20:41:00.000Z	jla	kjell	yes
2009-02-09T20:42:00.000Z	kjell	jla	What did you search for then? Try pidgin or some other famous program like wine. No results?
2009-02-09T20:43:00.000Z	jla	kjell	alex-weej I think my issue is with these "user friendly" programs, synaptic and add/remove applications. Crossfire is a game. If I fire up a terminal and aptitude search crossfire, I see it.
2009-02-09T20:44:00.000Z	jla		I must not understand how to use them
2009-02-09T20:44:00.000Z	kjell	jla	Try apt-get install crossfire in the terminal them.
2009-02-09T20:44:00.000Z	kjell		!crossfire
2009-02-09T20:44:00.000Z	jla	kjell	I'm sure that will work, but how to find these apps using the user friendly apps?
2009-02-09T20:44:00.000Z	kjell		Crossfire does not seem to be supported in ubuntu
2009-02-09T20:45:00.000Z	kjell	jla	read this: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=689208

2009-02-09T20:45:00.000Z	kjell		2. ATI support is very very bad in linux right now and crossfire is not supported."
2009-02-09T20:45:00.000Z	jla	kjell	must be the wrong one, the one alex-weej mentioned is it
2009-02-09T20:45:00.000Z	jla	kjell	it's a game
2009-02-09T20:46:00.000Z	kjell		Aaah, my bad then. Sorry jla.
2009-02-09T20:46:00.000Z	jla	kjell	alex-weej how does the average user find crossfire, gcompris or fwcutter to install from ubuntu? How to fix or bug this metadata?
