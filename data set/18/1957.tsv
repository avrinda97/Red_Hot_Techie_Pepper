2011-02-26T18:39:00.000Z	oCean	amit	the easiest way to setup 4.0 is modifying your sources.list as described here http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads
2011-02-26T19:27:00.000Z	oCean	amit	If you want to install the version from virtualbox.org, then follow the instructions here: http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads where it says "debian-based linux distributions" - it describes how to modify your sources.list
2011-02-27T15:14:00.000Z	oCean	amit	does your cpu have vt-x or vt-d?
2011-02-27T15:15:00.000Z	amit	oCean	yes i enabled both
2011-02-27T15:15:00.000Z	amit	oCean	i enabled VT,VT-d from BIOS setup
2011-02-27T15:15:00.000Z	oCean	amit	 you tried  egrep '(vmx|svm)' /proc/cpuinfo ?
2011-02-27T15:15:00.000Z	amit	oCean	yes
2011-02-27T15:15:00.000Z	oCean	amit	and it returns what?
2011-02-27T15:16:00.000Z	amit	oCean	it has vme and vmx also under flags
2011-02-27T15:17:00.000Z	oCean	amit	hmm.. in that case you should be able to run 64bit guest. And your error is..?
2011-02-27T15:18:00.000Z	amit	oCean	i have 64bit as my host also
2011-02-27T15:19:00.000Z	oCean	amit	maybe it requires boot option for the kernel. It's redhat?
2011-02-27T15:20:00.000Z	amit	oCean	yes i want to run red hat under virtual box and Ubuntu is my host OS
2011-02-27T15:22:00.000Z	oCean	amit	you might try asking in #rhel, mentioning your exact error
2011-02-27T15:22:00.000Z	amit	oCean	ok thanx i am going for it.thanx again for giving me time
2011-02-27T15:23:00.000Z	oCean	amit	no problem.
