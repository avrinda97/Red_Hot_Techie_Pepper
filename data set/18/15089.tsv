2005-05-07T06:01:00.000Z	theturtle		hey
2005-05-07T06:01:00.000Z	theturtle		is there anywhere i can download a dvd of ubuntu
2005-05-07T06:01:00.000Z	theturtle		with all the current apps?
2005-05-07T06:01:00.000Z	nickrud	theturtle	there is no dvd, ubuntu only releases a one cd install
2005-05-07T06:02:00.000Z	nickrud	theturtle	there's no reason
2005-05-07T06:03:00.000Z	nickrud	theturtle	what you need is the package apt-zip
2005-05-07T06:03:00.000Z	nickrud	theturtle	as long as you can leech broadband somewhere
2005-05-07T06:04:00.000Z	nickrud	theturtle	I know your pain :)
2005-05-07T06:34:00.000Z	theturtle	nickrud	u stilll around, wondering if you've ever used apt-zip before
2005-05-07T06:34:00.000Z	nickrud	theturtle	it's been a while, but for about a year I lived by it.
2005-05-07T06:36:00.000Z	nickrud	theturtle	let me install it and refamiliarize my self ...
2005-05-07T06:39:00.000Z	nickrud	theturtle	the way you use it is, on your linux machine, select the packages you want, then take the script to a networked machine
2005-05-07T09:37:00.000Z	nickrud	theturtle	http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/
2005-05-07T09:38:00.000Z	nickrud	theturtle	that's where the packages come from, but not all packages there belong to hoary :)
2005-05-07T09:40:00.000Z	nickrud	theturtle	didn't mean to be flippant, the way debian/ubuntu deals with packages is not just dropping them in a directory
2005-05-07T10:10:00.000Z	theturtle	nickrud	you weren't flippant, thats exactly what i asked...albeit thats a huge directory, shouldn't be problem mirroring it.
2005-05-07T10:11:00.000Z	nickrud	theturtle	if you are serious about mirroring, there's tools for that, ask on #debian
2005-05-07T10:12:00.000Z	nickrud	theturtle	be respectful, & don't mention ubuntu right away :)
