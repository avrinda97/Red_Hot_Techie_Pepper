2009-06-02T01:14:00.000Z	mdm		then making computer A a firewall is what you want
2009-06-02T01:15:00.000Z	mdm		then whatever eth0 is on computer A becomes the default gw for computer B
2009-06-02T01:17:00.000Z	hwilde	mdm	ipchains is deprecated :/
2009-06-02T01:11:00.000Z	mdm	hwilde	are you trying to share a connection from a connected PC to a non connected PC?
2009-06-02T01:13:00.000Z	mdm	hwilde	really I would just connect computer a directly, but setup ipchains on computer B and make it a firewall for computer A
2009-06-02T01:13:00.000Z	mdm	hwilde	is there some reason you dont simply use a hub or switch and share the ethernet connection?
2009-06-02T01:14:00.000Z	hwilde	mdm	"security"
2009-06-02T01:14:00.000Z	hwilde	mdm	if it were that easy I wouldn't be here asking u know
2009-06-02T01:14:00.000Z	hwilde	mdm	you mean proxy ?
2009-06-02T01:15:00.000Z	mdm	hwilde	you could, or put in ipchains and make a masquerading firewall
2009-06-02T01:16:00.000Z	hwilde	mdm	looking at ipchains now
2009-06-02T01:16:00.000Z	mdm	hwilde	setting up linux as a firewall takes VERY little resources, it may even be preferable to use some older hardware
2009-06-02T01:18:00.000Z	mdm	hwilde	probably my firewall is too, but it works :) just use whatever is lastest
2009-06-02T01:18:00.000Z	hwilde	mdm	iptables... but I don't think that does what I ant
2009-06-02T01:18:00.000Z	mdm	hwilde	yes that is how you share network connections in linux
2009-06-02T01:19:00.000Z	mdm	hwilde	computer B is running what OS?
2009-06-02T01:19:00.000Z	hwilde	mdm	all ubuntu
2009-06-02T01:20:00.000Z	mdm	hwilde	there are also distrbutions that do firewall exclusivly with a MUCH smaller footprint
