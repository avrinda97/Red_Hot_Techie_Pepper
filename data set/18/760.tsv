2011-09-23T01:53:00.000Z	wm4eo		can any body help me with voice problem in ubuntu?
2011-09-23T01:54:00.000Z	Praet0rian	wm4eo	just ask your question
2011-09-23T01:55:00.000Z	Praet0rian	wm4eo	open your sound settings and see what your input device is
2011-09-23T01:58:00.000Z	Praet0rian	wm4eo	try other things
2011-09-23T01:58:00.000Z	Praet0rian	wm4eo	there are no other options in the dropdown?
2011-09-23T02:00:00.000Z	Praet0rian	wm4eo	have you tried the MIC port
2011-09-23T02:00:00.000Z	Praet0rian	wm4eo	you have no internal MIC?
2011-09-23T02:01:00.000Z	Praet0rian	wm4eo	heres the thing, if you only have the INTErNAL selection in your sound settings, it would assume you are using that and not external
2011-09-23T02:02:00.000Z	Praet0rian	wm4eo	then the sound card is not working properly
2011-09-23T02:04:00.000Z	Praet0rian	wm4eo	the sound card handles your external ports also
2011-09-23T02:04:00.000Z	Praet0rian	wm4eo	get your sound card model and check manufactuer or search google for same issue
2011-09-23T02:04:00.000Z	Praet0rian	wm4eo	have to know your hardware if you're using linux just a tip
2011-09-23T02:05:00.000Z	Praet0rian	wm4eo	I do not know your manufacturer I cannot in any way know a web site for you
2011-09-23T02:07:00.000Z	Praet0rian	wm4eo	I am not going to do your research for you LoL, I am simply pointing you in the right direction
2011-09-23T02:10:00.000Z	Praet0rian	wm4eo	sorry didnt get it
2011-09-23T02:11:00.000Z	Praet0rian	wm4eo	I do not use kget
2011-09-23T02:11:00.000Z	Praet0rian	wm4eo	firefox has its own download manager
