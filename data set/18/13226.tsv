2005-12-22T08:28:00.000Z	feelmjawlk		Gordon
2005-12-22T08:28:00.000Z	feelmjawlk		what is your problem?
2005-12-22T08:29:00.000Z	feelmjawlk		mine is that I can't get any sound from my new soundcard: a soundblaster audigy 4
2005-12-22T08:29:00.000Z	feelmjawlk		I have already been there
2005-12-22T08:31:00.000Z	feelmjawlk		I had also fd://0 problem
2005-12-22T08:33:00.000Z	feelmjawlk		Is anyone experienced with hardware troubleshooting, and would like to take a look on my case?
2005-12-22T08:33:00.000Z	runevi	feelmjawlk	sort off.  what kind of hardware?
2005-12-22T08:34:00.000Z	feelmjawlk	runevi	soundcard, audigy 4 (audigy 2 chipset)
2005-12-22T08:34:00.000Z	runevi	feelmjawlk	Only getting static?
2005-12-22T08:35:00.000Z	feelmjawlk	runevi	Static? elaborate... the problem is I've no sound since I put in my new sndcard, here is an interesting line from lspci: 0000:00:0d.0 Multimedia audio controller: Creative Labs: Unknown device 0008
2005-12-22T08:35:00.000Z	runevi	feelmjawlk	Well, can't really help you as I don't get my Sound Blaster Audigy SE to work neither. :-/
2005-12-22T08:36:00.000Z	feelmjawlk	runevi	:( shame, for both of us
2005-12-22T08:36:00.000Z	feelmjawlk	runevi	But the Audigy SE isn't supported by alsa, right?
2005-12-22T08:37:00.000Z	feelmjawlk	runevi	I think I read somewhere someone used oss? I might be mistaken though
2005-12-22T08:37:00.000Z	runevi	feelmjawlk	correct.  but .. i'm waiting for support :D
2005-12-22T08:38:00.000Z	feelmjawlk	runevi	I actually purchased this card only because sound quality of my older sb pci 128 was inferior in linux vs. windows and I want to use linux on fulltime
