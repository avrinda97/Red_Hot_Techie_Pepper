2008-05-01T19:39:00.000Z	Pici	zephyr_blore	Did you upgrade to Gutsy before upgrading to Hardy?
2008-05-01T19:40:00.000Z	zephyr_blore	Pici	Yes i did
2008-05-01T19:48:00.000Z	zephyr_blore	Pici	how can i get my usb devices to work?
2008-05-01T19:48:00.000Z	zephyr_blore	Pici	Sorry if im bothering you, just wanted to know if there is an issue with the feisty>gutsy>hardy upgrade path
2008-05-01T19:49:00.000Z	Pici	zephyr_blore	No, that is the recommended upgrade path, I just wanted to make sure that you did that.
2008-05-01T19:50:00.000Z	zephyr_blore	Pici	Hmmn .. thanks. how would i know if the usb drivers are loaded in the kernel? what do i grep the lsmod output for?
2008-05-01T19:50:00.000Z	Pici	zephyr_blore	probably just for usb (or usbcore)
2008-05-01T19:51:00.000Z	zephyr_blore	Pici	Did that, it shows usbcore 146028  3 ehci_hcd,uhci_hcd
2008-05-01T19:52:00.000Z	zephyr_blore	Pici	Anything else that i can check for to fix the problem ?
2008-05-01T19:54:00.000Z	Pici	zephyr_blore	Check dmesg after you plug in your device(s)
2008-05-01T19:54:00.000Z	zephyr_blore	Pici	dmesg shows zilch. No reaction at all ..
2008-05-01T19:54:00.000Z	Pici	zephyr_blore	:?
2008-05-01T19:55:00.000Z	zephyr_blore	Pici	there is nothing new in dmesg related to the usb. Just the old lines from boot-up
2008-05-01T19:56:00.000Z	Pici	zephyr_blore	Thats rather odd
2008-05-01T19:56:00.000Z	zephyr_blore	Pici	let me do it again and i shall place the output in the paste-bin
2008-05-01T19:58:00.000Z	zephyr_blore	Pici	output of dmesg at http://paste.ubuntu.com/9221/
2008-05-01T20:20:00.000Z	zephyr_blore	Pici	Thanks !
