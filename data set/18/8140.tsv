2008-05-14T13:14:00.000Z	n2diy		Testing a "new" install of 5.10 on an old box, test.
2008-05-14T13:15:00.000Z	bazhang	n2diy	that is not supported here you realize
2008-05-14T13:15:00.000Z	n2diy	bazhang	why not, it is still Ubuntu!?
2008-05-14T13:19:00.000Z	n2diy	bazhang	fine business, this box was trash before 5.10 brought it back to life, so I'm happy.
2008-05-14T13:19:00.000Z	bazhang	n2diy	if it does what you need then more power to you
2008-12-07T08:45:00.000Z	bazhang	n2diy	what version of ubuntu are you using
2008-12-07T08:45:00.000Z	n2diy	bazhang	err, umm, aa, 5.10
2008-12-07T08:46:00.000Z	bazhang	n2diy	that is end of life. get a newer version if you want support
2008-12-07T08:47:00.000Z	n2diy	bazhang	that's what I'm trying to do, but I want to verify my burns on the way. I have a 6.06 disk here, but it won't install, so I'm hoping upgrading will work?
2008-12-07T08:47:00.000Z	bazhang	n2diy	you cannot do the disk integrity check without rebooting, no.
2008-12-07T08:48:00.000Z	bazhang	n2diy	you can md5 the iso before burning
2008-12-07T08:48:00.000Z	n2diy	bazhang	When booting the CD you have the option to verify it, I was hoping to do that, without rebooting?
2008-12-07T08:49:00.000Z	bazhang	n2diy	of course the answer is no.
2008-12-07T08:49:00.000Z	n2diy	bazhang	:( Thanks.
2009-02-18T16:58:00.000Z	bazhang	n2diy	then remaster with it in
2009-02-18T17:03:00.000Z	bazhang	n2diy	remaster with it in.
2009-09-13T05:20:00.000Z	bazhang	n2diy	.3 is a point release with all the security and bug fixes
2010-11-18T16:35:00.000Z	bazhang	n2diy	lsb_release -a
