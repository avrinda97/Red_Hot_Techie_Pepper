2009-03-12T12:18:00.000Z	wedwd		hello everybody, how to enable reiserfs support in ubuntu?
2009-03-12T12:19:00.000Z	wedwd		is it normal that reiserfs is not even shipped as module or apt-get'able module? it has been a standart for years
2009-03-12T12:19:00.000Z	Frogzoo	wedwd	I'm not sure reiser is even shipping these days, since reiser went down
2009-03-12T12:19:00.000Z	wedwd		anyway, do i really have to compile a kernel to get ubuntu to mount my reiserfs partitions?
2009-03-12T12:20:00.000Z	wedwd	Frogzoo	i'm sure it is, download any kernel to see
2009-03-12T12:20:00.000Z	Frogzoo	wedwd	the bigger problem is that reiser is no longer under development
2009-03-12T12:20:00.000Z	wedwd	Frogzoo	that's what you say
2009-03-12T12:20:00.000Z	Frogzoo	wedwd	it's what I've heard..
2009-03-12T12:20:00.000Z	wedwd	Frogzoo	you should not believe anything poeple tell you
2009-03-12T12:21:00.000Z	wedwd	Frogzoo	it's open source, other programmers can maitain it you know
2009-03-12T12:21:00.000Z	Frogzoo	wedwd	quite right
2009-03-12T12:21:00.000Z	wedwd	Frogzoo	then, what b-tree-ish FS does ubuntu recommand?
2009-03-12T12:21:00.000Z	Frogzoo	wedwd	can other programmers maintain reiser's code?
2009-03-12T12:21:00.000Z	wedwd	Frogzoo	of course, it's release under GNU license
2009-03-12T12:22:00.000Z	wedwd	Frogzoo	what do you want to maintain a FS that has been working for 15 years?
2009-03-12T12:22:00.000Z	wedwd	Frogzoo	even if you were talking about reiser4 that would be wrong
2009-03-12T12:23:00.000Z	wedwd		because third party developers work on it, and develop plugins.... anyway, do i have to compile a kernel to mount a reiserfs partition?
2009-03-12T12:24:00.000Z	wedwd	Frogzoo	it's cool that ubuntu ships a tainted kernel to make things "easier", but open source standarts should be supported, at least with apt-get install reiserfs-modules ...
