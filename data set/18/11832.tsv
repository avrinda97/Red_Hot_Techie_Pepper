2006-12-20T06:47:00.000Z	Trixsey		exec beryl-manager
2006-12-20T06:48:00.000Z	Trixsey		Is it the same syntax?
2006-12-20T06:49:00.000Z	Trixsey		oh ok lol
2006-12-20T06:50:00.000Z	Trixsey		maybe an & in the end? no difference in this case?
2006-12-20T06:51:00.000Z	Trixsey		no
2006-12-20T06:51:00.000Z	Trixsey		I ment like
2006-12-20T06:51:00.000Z	Trixsey		in terminal you do "command &" so you can still use terminal
2006-12-20T06:52:00.000Z	Trixsey		so one running program doesn't occupy it
2006-12-20T06:52:00.000Z	Trixsey		what good is it in a shellscript?
2006-12-20T06:52:00.000Z	Trixsey		ok
2006-12-20T06:52:00.000Z	jrib	Trixsey	if you don't put the &, the script won't continue until that command finishes
2007-01-13T10:34:00.000Z	jrib	Trixsey	you could always write a short script to do it for you
2007-01-13T10:35:00.000Z	Trixsey	jrib	yeah
2007-01-13T10:35:00.000Z	Trixsey	jrib	I was wondering if there was a variable in nautilus for current file?
2007-01-13T10:36:00.000Z	jrib	Trixsey	yes, if you use nautilus scripts, there are some variables that get passed.  I was just thinking of a regular shell script that takes input, strips the file:///, and passes it to azureus
2007-01-13T10:37:00.000Z	jrib	Trixsey	relax.  He was trying to help you
2007-02-22T10:36:00.000Z	Trixsey	jrib	how about zip? :/
2007-02-22T10:37:00.000Z	jrib	Trixsey	click the link :)
