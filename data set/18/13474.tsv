2006-10-11T16:07:00.000Z	oskude	lansing	propably, but the helps on ubotu are mostly for the actual version of ubuntu...
2006-10-11T16:18:00.000Z	oskude	lansing	didnt someone allready answer to that ?
2006-10-11T16:19:00.000Z	oskude	lansing	hmm "<kemik> lansing: yeah it works with breezy"
2006-10-11T16:20:00.000Z	oskude	lansing	you know that the strong point of java is that it runs on "any" os ? ;)
2006-10-11T16:20:00.000Z	oskude	lansing	well, i cant help on java, i never use it...
2006-10-11T05:08:00.000Z	oskude	lansing	then wait a while and ask again...
2006-10-11T05:13:00.000Z	oskude	lansing	btw, is there a reason that you still use breezy ?
2006-10-11T05:19:00.000Z	oskude	lansing	report to seveas (or who did that tool)
2006-10-11T05:33:00.000Z	oskude	lansing	you mean using packages from dapper in breezy (with out upgrading to dapper) ?
2006-10-11T05:33:00.000Z	oskude	lansing	i wouldnt recommend...
2006-10-11T05:35:00.000Z	oskude	lansing	you did a fresh install of breezy like a sec ago ?
2006-10-11T05:35:00.000Z	oskude	lansing	then you could atleast try what you wanted :)
2006-10-11T05:39:00.000Z	oskude	lansing	forum to edit sources.list ?
2006-10-12T15:20:00.000Z	oskude	lansing	a dot "." before a file/dir name means its handled as "hidden" file/dir by bash and file managers...
