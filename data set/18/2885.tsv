2010-09-24T00:49:00.000Z	GregUK		Hi all. I have a number of web servers in a load balanced cluster. Can anyone suggest a way of replicating users' uploaded files (images) to all servers in the cluster?
2010-09-24T00:50:00.000Z	Kyle__	GregUK	You can use a clustered filesystem.  Or you could have them all mount a volume on a SAN or a fast NAS.
2010-09-24T00:50:00.000Z	Kyle__	GregUK	If you want solid and instantanious, you need to look at a SAN.  They cost $$, but they work.
2010-09-24T00:51:00.000Z	Kyle__	GregUK	The question will become, what's your budget, and how solid does it need to be?
2010-09-24T00:53:00.000Z	Kyle__	GregUK	If you're using all linux, you could use a coraid etherdrive SAN.  Those are pretty cheap, for a SAN.
2010-09-24T00:54:00.000Z	Kyle__	GregUK	If it helps, iscsi was rock solid when I used it on RHEL servers.
2010-09-24T00:55:00.000Z	GregUK	Kyle__	ikonia: is there an OSS solution? Would something like NFS work?
2010-09-24T00:56:00.000Z	Kyle__	GregUK	it would, given testing, and a reliable enough NFS server.  But an inexpsnive SAN is about the same price, and it's purpose built for it.
2010-09-24T00:57:00.000Z	Kyle__	GregUK	Are you at the point of zero budget or somefin? :)
2010-09-24T00:58:00.000Z	GregUK	Kyle__	I'd prefer to make use of what we've got if possible... shed loads of unused storage and RAID 6
2010-09-24T00:59:00.000Z	GregUK	Kyle__	did you have anything in mind when you suggested a clustered filesystem?
2010-09-24T01:00:00.000Z	Kyle__	GregUK	There are two types of cluster-filesystems.  Those which allow multiple servers to simultaniously use one physical drive.  And those where multiple servers all have their own physical drive, and but sync them togeather to look like one shared drive
2010-09-24T01:00:00.000Z	Kyle__	GregUK	The first type is more stable and better tested.
2010-09-24T01:02:00.000Z	GregUK	Kyle__	what would you recommended for the first option?
2010-09-24T01:03:00.000Z	Kyle__	GregUK	I honestly never got to use them, so I would just go with one that has active develoment.
2010-09-24T01:03:00.000Z	Kyle__	GregUK	GFS is supposed to be well spuported...and OCFS2 as well, but that's not under heavy development
2010-09-24T01:03:00.000Z	GregUK	Kyle__	I'll take a look, thanks :)
2010-09-24T01:04:00.000Z	Kyle__	GregUK	NP!
