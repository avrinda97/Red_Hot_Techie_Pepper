2008-05-26T22:55:00.000Z	indio		What are "default mixer tracks" ?
2008-05-26T22:56:00.000Z	fde	indio	Right click the speaker icon in the top panel ... "Open Volume Control" ... those
2008-05-26T22:58:00.000Z	indio	fde	I mean those that appear in System -> Preferences -> Sound
2008-05-26T22:58:00.000Z	fde	indio	Yeah, you'll notice the headers match what I showed you.
2008-05-26T22:59:00.000Z	indio	fde	I didn't get it. Which headers ?
2008-05-26T23:00:00.000Z	fde	indio	At the top of each row in the app I showed you
2008-05-26T23:01:00.000Z	indio	fde	Is it OK if I don't select any default mixer tracks ?
2008-05-26T23:01:00.000Z	fde	indio	sure
2008-05-26T23:02:00.000Z	fde	indio	Are you having an issue with your sound?
2008-05-26T23:02:00.000Z	fde	indio	Turn up Mic volume in the app I showed you.
2008-05-26T23:04:00.000Z	fde	indio	You should also be able to go to File > Change Device and select the "Capture" entry for your Mic.
2008-05-26T23:05:00.000Z	fde	indio	There are issues with some cards though, you might simply be unlucky enough to be effected by that.
2008-05-26T23:06:00.000Z	indio	fde	Looks like I'm affected. If I configure dmix, no sound capture is possible.
2008-05-28T05:23:00.000Z	fde	indio	yes
2008-05-28T05:24:00.000Z	fde	indio	choose it from the Session menu in GDM
2008-05-29T04:53:00.000Z	fde	indio	sudo aptitude update && sudo aptitude safe-upgrades
2008-05-29T04:53:00.000Z	fde	indio	sudo aptitude update && sudo aptitude safe-upgrade
