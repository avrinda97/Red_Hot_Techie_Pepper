2010-06-15T17:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	tsubame	 all of them have issues.  I rarely use them. xbmc is proberly the most popular and well done.
2010-06-15T17:09:00.000Z	tsubame	Dr_Willis	alright will have a look
2010-06-15T17:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	tsubame	 theres many that are not in the package manager, (need ppa repos) and a few that are.  Moovidia is in the repos. enna and xbmc are not i recall
2010-06-15T17:09:00.000Z	tsubame	Dr_Willis	nah. enna is there. xbmc is missing
2010-06-15T17:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	tsubame	 enna is the next generation of 'geexbox' which is a mini-home theater/set top box theater-system type OS :) thats why i rember it
2010-06-15T17:11:00.000Z	tsubame	Dr_Willis	ill try that to get disappointed then, fellow archer
2010-06-15T17:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	tsubame	 i recall one of them let you brosws online comics and manga also.  a few i had a hard time to get working properly
2010-06-15T17:11:00.000Z	tsubame	Dr_Willis	so which one is easiest to get up and running?
2010-06-15T17:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	tsubame	 install the ones that are in the repo and try them out. thats the easy ones
2010-06-15T17:12:00.000Z	tsubame	Dr_Willis	alright then
2010-06-15T17:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	tsubame	 xbmc isent too hard to get going. but its interface is a little weirder in ways
2010-06-15T17:15:00.000Z	tsubame	Dr_Willis	enna looks fine so far. gotta figure out how to do settigns though
