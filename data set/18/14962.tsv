2005-05-28T11:41:00.000Z	batma8		so does ubuntu typically run alot faster than windows?
2005-05-28T11:41:00.000Z	refuze2looze	batma8	hell yea
2005-05-28T11:42:00.000Z	refuze2looze	batma8	which ones?
2005-05-28T11:42:00.000Z	refuze2looze	batma8	i know there's zsnes and snes9x, i used em before.. it's like the same ones as the windows ones
2005-05-28T11:43:00.000Z	refuze2looze	batma8	you can installl them from synaptic with the universe/multiverse sources enabled
2005-05-28T11:46:00.000Z	refuze2looze	batma8	do you know how to use synaptic?
2005-05-28T11:46:00.000Z	refuze2looze	batma8	well that will make everything much simpler.. it's the package installer
2005-05-28T11:46:00.000Z	refuze2looze	batma8	click on System -> Administrative -> Synaptic
2005-05-28T11:47:00.000Z	refuze2looze	batma8	this is where you should install all of your software from
2005-05-28T11:47:00.000Z	refuze2looze	batma8	no you don't need to use your terminal. it's a gui. it's the gui frontend for "apt-get"
2005-05-28T11:48:00.000Z	refuze2looze	batma8	so are you in synaptic? i'll help you get .avi's working
2005-05-28T11:49:00.000Z	refuze2looze	batma8	no you should use VLC
2005-05-28T11:49:00.000Z	refuze2looze	batma8	in synaptic go to Settings -> Repositories
2005-05-28T11:50:00.000Z	refuze2looze	batma8	now remove any of the repositories that says (source), you wont be needing em
2005-05-28T11:50:00.000Z	refuze2looze	batma8	as for the binary ones, edit them and add "universe multiverse" to sections. this will add all packages available from ubuntu repositories to download
2005-05-28T11:51:00.000Z	refuze2looze	batma8	then click OK and 'Reload'. with me so far??
2005-05-28T11:52:00.000Z	refuze2looze	batma8	now search for "VLC" and you should see a package VLC. check it and hit apply
2005-05-28T11:53:00.000Z	refuze2looze	batma8	hmm, did it find VLC though?
