2008-11-29T01:08:00.000Z	Pupeno		Any ideas why my name apperas like this: J. Pablo" Fernández, with a quote in the middle, in all the mails I send? I configured it as J. Pablo Fernández, of course.
2008-11-29T01:09:00.000Z	oskar-	Pupeno	how do you send the mails?
2008-11-29T01:10:00.000Z	Pupeno	oskar-	Evolution, smpt (courier mta, my own server)
2008-11-29T01:13:00.000Z	oskar-	Pupeno	is it shown wrong on other mail user agents? maybe evolution a problem because of the non-ascii character,  at time of editing or showing
2008-11-29T01:14:00.000Z	Pupeno	oskar-	it is showing wrong everywhere (except sent folder).
2008-11-29T01:14:00.000Z	Pupeno	oskar-	like this: http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/msg/91d4a5ac2ecb03c5?dmode=source
2008-11-29T01:16:00.000Z	oskar-	Pupeno	what is the raw, encoded "From:" line in a message from the sent folder?
2008-11-29T01:17:00.000Z	Pupeno	oskar-	From: "J. Pablo" =?ISO-8859-1?Q?Fern=E1ndez?= <pupeno@pupeno.com>
2008-11-29T01:18:00.000Z	oskar-	Pupeno	ok, the quote sign, that is disturbing, is somehow escaped with a backslash
2008-11-29T01:20:00.000Z	oskar-	Pupeno	i will try, what a sendmail and a postfix do with such a inner quote sign
2008-11-29T01:22:00.000Z	Pupeno	oskar-	thanks.
2008-11-29T01:29:00.000Z	oskar-	Pupeno	both, sendmail and postfix seem to change the from line. i guess (but don't know), that the unescaped quote with the space afterwards is not valid this encoding
2008-11-29T01:30:00.000Z	Pupeno	oskar-	is Evolution encoding my name wrongly?
2008-11-29T01:31:00.000Z	oskar-	Pupeno	yes, it seems to me
2008-11-29T01:32:00.000Z	Pupeno	oskar-	ok, https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/evolution/+bug/303254  (feel free to add information if you can, you know more than I here)
2008-11-29T01:33:00.000Z	oskar-	Pupeno	ok...
2008-11-29T01:35:00.000Z	Pupeno	oskar-	thanks very much.
2008-11-29T01:40:00.000Z	oskar-	Pupeno	is your name surrounded by quotes in evolution?
