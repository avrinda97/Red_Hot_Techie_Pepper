2011-10-20T03:40:00.000Z	arand	Islam	/var/log/dpkg.log is a log of all package changes, it may be useful.
2011-10-20T03:41:00.000Z	arand	Islam	But would it not be easier to just reinstall ehcp?
2011-10-20T03:41:00.000Z	Islam	arand	thanx alot I'll have a look
2011-10-20T03:42:00.000Z	Islam		no its now about ehcp, its about the command I used to uninstall it, the command removed other packages
2011-10-20T03:47:00.000Z	Islam		is there a command work like a system restore for a previous date or somthing ?
2011-10-20T03:49:00.000Z	arand	Islam	unfortunately not, I think dpkg/apt lacks the transaction history/undo of rpm/yum
2011-10-20T03:49:00.000Z	Islam	arand	I didnt understan what you are saying
