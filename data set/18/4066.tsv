2009-07-25T21:01:00.000Z	JonathanEllis		I have a folder in Trash that I dont have permission to delete. How do I get rid of it?
2009-07-25T21:02:00.000Z	edbian	JonathanEllis	You could give yourself permission using the "chown" command.
2009-07-25T21:03:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	edbian	Thanks. What is the path to items in trash?
2009-07-25T21:03:00.000Z	edbian	JonathanEllis	Good question!  I'm not really sure. :)
2009-07-25T21:04:00.000Z	edbian	JonathanEllis	It's a hidden folder in your /home directory: "/home/JonathanEllis/.Trash"
2009-08-06T21:38:00.000Z	edbian	JonathanEllis	You should be alright :)..
2009-08-06T21:39:00.000Z	edbian	JonathanEllis	NP
2009-08-08T20:12:00.000Z	edbian	JonathanEllis	Have you tried "sudo apt-get -f" ?
2009-08-08T20:14:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	edbian	Yes I have tried that. The error I get is in my pastebin
2009-08-08T20:16:00.000Z	edbian	JonathanEllis	It sounds to me (this is mostly speculation) that the hard drive is going bad.
2009-08-08T20:16:00.000Z	edbian	JonathanEllis	Are there I/O errors in dmesg?
2009-08-08T20:22:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	edbian	I will check dmesg
2009-08-08T20:44:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	edbian	I'm not sure how to identify errors in dmesg. 'dmesg | grep error' doesnt produce any output
2009-08-08T20:45:00.000Z	edbian	JonathanEllis	just run "dmesg" and look near the end of it
2009-08-08T20:47:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	edbian	I don't think so but I am not sure. My dmesg output is at http://pastebin.com/d48df6442
2009-08-08T20:47:00.000Z	edbian	JonathanEllis	There are no I/O errors in there
2009-08-08T20:47:00.000Z	edbian	JonathanEllis	I don't know! :(
2009-08-08T20:48:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	edbian	Thanks anyway :-)
