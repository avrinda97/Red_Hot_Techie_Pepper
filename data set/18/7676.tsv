2007-12-11T20:14:00.000Z	LOGAN		cover of ubuntu warns installer whipes hdd by default. why not set partitioning by default?
2007-12-11T20:14:00.000Z	LOGAN		concerning new users and people who switch from windows
2007-12-11T20:15:00.000Z	LOGAN		besides the link was ontopic, it compares ubuntu and debian search results :|
2007-12-11T20:15:00.000Z	LOGAN		: bulmer nothing, Im just curious why the installer would set to whipe hdd
2007-12-11T20:16:00.000Z	LOGAN		see ubuntu CD cover for details
2007-12-11T20:17:00.000Z	LOGAN		"The default installation will erase all existing data from your computer" the cd cover says
2007-12-11T20:19:00.000Z	LOGAN		pici 7.10
2007-12-11T20:19:00.000Z	LOGAN		you know how impatient windows users can be
2007-12-11T20:21:00.000Z	LOGAN		pici well I dunno, seems almost like it formats your hdd if you're not being carefull :)
2007-12-11T20:22:00.000Z	LOGAN		almost scared to give it away, afraid someone would accidentially whipe his whole HDD and then complain with me
2007-12-11T20:22:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	LOGAN	It comes up to a screen and ASKS if you want to use the entire drive or gives you options at that point.  You must say yes.. I want to use the entire drive.
2007-12-11T20:23:00.000Z	LOGAN	Jack_Sparrow	: will it also help set up partitions and boot options automatically?
2007-12-11T20:23:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	LOGAN	yes
2007-12-11T20:23:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow		!firewall
2007-12-11T20:24:00.000Z	LOGAN		pici not yet as Im unfamilair with partitioning and have to make room for it first. Im just worried to pass it on and some noob will whipe his drive using default settings :)
2007-12-11T20:25:00.000Z	LOGAN		I dont even know if I could use another HDD partition to have that partition for ubuntu
2007-12-11T20:26:00.000Z	LOGAN		I have 2 drives with 4 partitions... could it partition an existing partition in two parts?
2007-12-11T20:26:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	LOGAN	Yes it can shrink an existing partition and add one for ubuntu..
