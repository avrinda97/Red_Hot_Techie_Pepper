2007-01-05T11:56:00.000Z	Falstius		what error did the default kernel give you?
2007-01-05T11:57:00.000Z	windswept	Falstius	the default kernel just reboots after the word boot appears on the screen.
2007-01-05T11:58:00.000Z	Falstius	windswept	that is definitely odd.  So what happens with the new kernel?
2007-01-05T11:58:00.000Z	windswept	Falstius	problem is that I can not find a new kernel that will get that far.
2007-01-05T11:59:00.000Z	Falstius	windswept	you could just compile a vanilla kernel and install it.
2007-01-05T12:00:00.000Z	Falstius	windswept	its also possible that the problem isn't the kernel but grub.  I've never seen a kernel problem do that.
2007-01-05T12:00:00.000Z	windswept	Falstius	 this is my first machine that I am using with ubuntu.  I am speaking with you from my windows laptop.
2007-01-05T12:03:00.000Z	Falstius	windswept	it probably creates the initrd when it is installed using mkinitrd
2007-01-05T12:03:00.000Z	windswept	Falstius	Asc,  btw, I have tried a standard kernel from joeyhess's daily build but that ended up installing debian.
2007-01-05T12:04:00.000Z	Falstius	windswept	er, createinitrd (or something like that, I can't remember the exact command)
2007-01-05T12:27:00.000Z	Falstius	windswept	no, since it depends on the machine.
2007-01-05T12:28:00.000Z	windswept	Falstius	there would be differences between the 386 machines?
2007-01-05T12:29:00.000Z	Falstius	windswept	yes, depending on the hard drive controller, chipset, etc.
2007-01-05T12:32:00.000Z	Falstius	windswept	I still suspect the problem is with grub (maybe pointing to the wrong place) and not the kernel.  mkinitrd
2007-01-05T12:34:00.000Z	Falstius	windswept	this page talks about making an initrd file on Debian, should be the same for ubuntu: http://www.edseek.com/archives/2004/03/22/creating-an-initrd-image-on-debian-gnulinux/
2007-01-05T12:35:00.000Z	windswept	Falstius	I am taking teh original initrd and then trying to add the drivers for this kernel. and then will pray that this works.
2007-01-05T12:35:00.000Z	Falstius	windswept	you're probably going to want to create a fresh initrd instead of modify an old one (you could do that, but it is trickier)
2007-01-05T12:59:00.000Z	windswept	Falstius	here goes nothing....
