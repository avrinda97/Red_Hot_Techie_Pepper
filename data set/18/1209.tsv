2011-04-27T04:43:00.000Z	djr013	bethany	Are you using the partition where those dirs were deleted?
2011-04-27T04:43:00.000Z	djr013	bethany	If any of that got overwritten, then probably not. But you can try PhotoRec (spelled right?) to search for deleted but still remaining data.
2011-04-27T04:44:00.000Z	djr013	bethany	In the interest of hindsight, always do backups. :P
2011-04-27T04:45:00.000Z	djr013	bethany	Tip: Get off that partition, and mount it read only.
2011-04-27T04:46:00.000Z	djr013	bethany	Honestly, you've probably got your work cut out for you. PhotoRec is the only such tool I'm aware of, and it doesn't restore filenames, only looks for stuff on disk that it thinks looks like data.
2011-04-27T04:47:00.000Z	djr013	bethany	But you don't want to be using that partition in the meantime.
2011-04-27T04:47:00.000Z	djr013	bethany	Shut it down, burn a cd/memory stick with PartedMagic or similar.
2011-04-27T04:47:00.000Z	djr013	bethany	On another computer, I mean.
2011-04-27T04:50:00.000Z	djr013	bethany	The more you use the machine, the more data you lose. :P
2011-04-27T04:50:00.000Z	djr013	bethany	I shudder to think of the logs of your IRC app overwriting valuable data.. :/
2011-04-27T04:52:00.000Z	bethany	djr013	 i was remotey connected to the server
2011-04-27T04:53:00.000Z	djr013	bethany	Well, any data written to disk (like Firefox profiles and whatnot) can potentially take the place of a formerly referenced file's location on the disk.
2011-04-27T04:56:00.000Z	djr013	bethany	Good luck, I might be having to use PhotoRec or something similar today too. :C
