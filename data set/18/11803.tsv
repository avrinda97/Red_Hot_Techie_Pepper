2007-09-01T16:42:00.000Z	crazyhorse		Hi
2007-09-01T16:43:00.000Z	crazyhorse		I'm rather new to linux setup, currently I'm running Windows Vista Business, Windows XP Pro and a Fedora Core 5
2007-09-01T16:43:00.000Z	crazyhorse		I would like to install Ubuntu 7.04 64BIT isntead of Fedora core 5
2007-09-01T16:44:00.000Z	crazyhorse		does anyone here have any experience with this?
2007-09-01T16:44:00.000Z	jrib	crazyhorse	why do you want 64bit instead of 32bit?  Is this a desktop system?
2007-09-01T16:46:00.000Z	crazyhorse	jrib	sorry for not replying, yes, this is a desktop system,
2007-09-01T16:46:00.000Z	jrib	crazyhorse	you should install 32bit then.  Things like flash and sun java plugin are a pain on 64bit because adobe and sun don't provide them
2007-09-01T16:46:00.000Z	crazyhorse	jrib	i just figured 64 bit would give a better performance on a 64 bit system ?
2007-09-01T16:47:00.000Z	jrib	crazyhorse	not really, you won't notice
2007-09-01T16:48:00.000Z	crazyhorse	jrib	so, theres not really any performace difference between the 32 and the 64 bit ?
2007-09-01T16:50:00.000Z	jrib	crazyhorse	I don't really know the technical details, but I think you just get the ability to use more ram.  I do know that you won't notice any performance difference though because I've used both on my system
2007-09-01T16:57:00.000Z	jrib	crazyhorse	when you install ubuntu, you should be able to tell it to use the fedora partition.  And when it installs grub, it searches for other OS and tries to set them up automatically
2007-09-01T16:58:00.000Z	crazyhorse	jrib	thx, So did Fedora, its just, i would seriously be fucked if i were unable to boot in windoze, seeing as I'm totally new, and unfamiliar with linux
2007-09-01T16:59:00.000Z	jrib	crazyhorse	I've never installed ubuntu with vista on  a partition, but it has detected XP fine for me in the past
2007-09-01T16:59:00.000Z	crazyhorse	jrib	but your suggestion is that i should install 32Bit OS, Even though i have a 64Bit Cpu and so on?
2007-09-01T05:00:00.000Z	jrib	crazyhorse	yes, especially if you are new
2007-09-01T05:00:00.000Z	crazyhorse	jrib	thx
2007-09-01T05:01:00.000Z	jrib	crazyhorse	bye
