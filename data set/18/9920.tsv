2007-03-20T06:00:00.000Z	SammyF		I'll just try it again : there are some applications I apparently cannot start (conqoper and mordor are just two examples). As a user I lack the authorisations, and when I use sudo APPNAME bash doesn't find the apliation, even if I'm in the directory. Any help?
2007-03-20T06:01:00.000Z	Flannel	SammyF	kdesu or gksu for graphical programs.  That's likely your problem.  Delete the Xauthority and ICEauthority files in your homedir
2007-03-20T06:02:00.000Z	SammyF	Flannel	console applications. Both are servers. I'll try deleting Xauthority and ICEauthority
2007-03-20T06:02:00.000Z	Flannel	SammyF	oh, they're servers?  Nevermind then.  That's not your issue.
2007-03-20T06:03:00.000Z	SammyF	Flannel	okay ... thanks anyway :)
2007-03-20T06:03:00.000Z	SammyF	Flannel	my gfx card gave up on me, so I have an old one in there. therefore it's nethack or console stuff at the moment if I want to play :)
2007-03-20T06:04:00.000Z	Flannel	SammyF	ah, welcome to my world!
2007-03-20T06:04:00.000Z	SammyF	Flannel	can I leave your world asap please? I was sooo happy when I got OGRE3D to compile yesterday, and now I can't even write anything for it ;)
2007-03-20T06:05:00.000Z	Flannel	SammyF	well, for most servers, you'll want to run with sudo.  Although, I imagine they have an init daemon. Yeah.
2007-03-20T06:05:00.000Z	Flannel	SammyF	so, to start mordor, `sudo /etc/init.d/mordor restart`
2007-03-20T06:06:00.000Z	SammyF	Flannel	indeed!
2007-03-20T06:06:00.000Z	SammyF	Flannel	thanks!!
2007-03-20T06:06:00.000Z	Flannel	SammyF	and, I suppose you mustve misspelt the first one.  Since, I don't see it in the repos.
2007-03-20T06:06:00.000Z	Flannel	SammyF	I assumed you meant konqueror, which is why I mentioned the --authority stuff.
2007-03-20T06:07:00.000Z	SammyF	Flannel	the other one is conquest. the manual says to start "conqoper" to setup a game.
2007-03-20T06:09:00.000Z	Flannel	SammyF	I'd try "conquest", "conqinit", or maybe "conquestsh", juding by the files in the package.  Try "man conquest" though, that might give you hte command
2007-03-31T14:12:00.000Z	SammyF	Flannel	sigh ... you beat me to it
2007-03-31T14:12:00.000Z	SammyF	Flannel	 :)
