2009-11-13T11:01:00.000Z	VanessaE		ok, weird question:  What is the latest build of the kernel for Karmic?  2.6.31-14 or -15?
2009-11-13T11:01:00.000Z	VanessaE		(my box says the latter, ubuntu.com says the former)
2009-11-13T11:01:00.000Z	Blue1	VanessaE	I am running -14
2009-11-13T11:02:00.000Z	Blue1	VanessaE	dunno --
2009-11-13T12:15:00.000Z	VanessaE	Blue1	I think she means which of the two "temp" labels is really the CPU
2009-11-13T12:15:00.000Z	Blue1	VanessaE	ahh I don't know - I don't know how to monitor cpu temps in linux
2009-11-13T12:18:00.000Z	Blue1	VanessaE	how do you monitor the temp any way - what programme does that?
2009-11-13T12:18:00.000Z	VanessaE	Blue1	I use wmtemp
2009-11-13T12:18:00.000Z	Blue1	VanessaE	I'll give it a try
2009-11-13T12:20:00.000Z	Blue1	VanessaE	wmtemp doesn't work onmy machine -- got weird errors installing it...
2009-11-13T12:20:00.000Z	VanessaE	Blue1	such as?
2009-11-13T12:21:00.000Z	Blue1	VanessaE	http://paste.ubuntu.com/317573/
2009-11-13T12:23:00.000Z	Blue1	VanessaE	let me look at the man and see if I understand that
2009-11-13T12:24:00.000Z	Blue1	VanessaE	no it just does nothing - the task is in the taskbar but nothing comes up - I don't understand what you meant by sensors
2009-11-13T12:25:00.000Z	Blue1	VanessaE	okay
2009-11-13T12:25:00.000Z	Blue1	VanessaE	ahh that worked
2009-11-13T12:26:00.000Z	Blue1	VanessaE	wow one is at 143F and the other at 141F
