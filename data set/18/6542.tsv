2008-09-29T01:08:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	TJ13820	If the server's both have static IP configurations then the names would be set in the router's resolver, depending on what it uses possibly /etc/hosts or dnsmasq, etc.
2008-09-29T01:08:00.000Z	TJ13820	IntuitiveNipple	this is a cisco router. it views the hostmask sent by the machine
2008-09-29T01:12:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	TJ13820	there is no 'sent by the machine' for DNS resolution *unless* using dynamic DNS update. In any event, put Wireshark on the segment and observe the interchange when the server NICs come up, to see what is different between the two.
2008-09-29T01:15:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	TJ13820	eeek... that sounds like a good explanation for a *lot* of things! (could it be a flakey cable?)
2008-09-29T01:16:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	TJ13820	have you rotated the ports used by the PCs to see if the same port affects different devices (or the failure follows the device) ?
2008-09-29T01:18:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	TJ13820	ipconfig?
2008-09-29T01:20:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	TJ13820	I don't see any recent updates issued for iproute, I've just looked at the hardy-changes mailing list.
2008-09-29T01:21:00.000Z	TJ13820	IntuitiveNipple	it wasn't recent. I just installed server on a new machine
2008-09-29T01:22:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	TJ13820	But your issue sounds like router configuration - a router won't get a name unless it has been statically declared either via a hosts file, or a DHCP reservation, or DNS zone.
2008-09-29T01:22:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	TJ13820	Oh, okay, you made it sound like something that updated in the last couple of weeks :)
2008-09-29T01:23:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	TJ13820	No, the hosts file (or equivilent) in the router - this is a router resolution issue isn't it?
2008-09-29T01:24:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	TJ13820	It doesn't 'send' it, that's what I've been saying (unless using SMB with NetBIOS naming and something like winbind)
2008-09-29T01:24:00.000Z	TJ13820	IntuitiveNipple	i installed Samba on my new server. I'm not sure about this one
2008-09-29T01:25:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	TJ13820	If the router issues a reserved IP to a server via DHCP lease then the name of the PC will get propagated to the router's name resolution tables, but if the PC has a statically defined IP and doesn't use DHCP then (without dynamic DNS or NetBIOS/winbind stuff) the router won't get the name.
2008-09-29T01:27:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	TJ13820	the solution is to set up a DNS zone file in the router for the local LAN, and create A records for the servers, and create a reverse-lookup subnet zone to resolve IP-to-name requests too
2008-09-29T01:27:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	TJ13820	hah!
2008-09-29T01:27:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	TJ13820	So, it was SMB/NetBIOS
2008-09-29T01:27:00.000Z	TJ13820	IntuitiveNipple	my samba install was broken! haha
