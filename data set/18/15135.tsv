2005-12-07T13:40:00.000Z	tyler	Juhaz	i'm on gnome-look.org and theres a section called GTK 1+ and 2+, I was wondering what it was
2005-12-07T13:43:00.000Z	tyler		im in love with q4
2005-12-07T13:43:00.000Z	Juhaz	tyler	more or less everything, the buttons, menus and other widgets that make up apps.
2005-12-07T13:44:00.000Z	tyler	Juhaz	ok, thanks
2005-12-07T13:45:00.000Z	tyler	Juhaz	whats the difference between v2 and v1?
2005-12-07T13:47:00.000Z	Juhaz	tyler	gtk 1.x is very old and not used by many apps any more, xmms probably being the most common
2005-12-07T13:47:00.000Z	tyler	Juhaz	oh ok
2005-12-07T13:48:00.000Z	tyler	Juhaz	would this be hard to install? The DL button doesn't even work, haha http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php?content=31128
2005-12-07T13:53:00.000Z	Juhaz	tyler	I don't think that one is even real, just concept art
2005-12-07T13:54:00.000Z	tyler	Juhaz	yeah, me too
2005-12-07T13:54:00.000Z	tyler	Juhaz	whats metacity?
2005-12-07T13:56:00.000Z	Juhaz	tyler	the gnome window manager, in theme sense, metacity theme affects the title bar and window borders
2005-12-07T13:56:00.000Z	tyler	Juhaz	okay cool.  Which would I get that can change the top and bottom bars? (Apps/places/system etc)
2005-12-07T13:57:00.000Z	Juhaz	tyler	panel appearance is mostly from gtk theme
2005-12-07T13:58:00.000Z	Juhaz	tyler	and the main menu icons from icon theme
