2012-11-20T11:15:00.000Z	SpecialEd		So I've been trying to use dd with the following command (in bold): dd if=/ of/tempdir/disk.iso but for some reason it doesn't write anything, do I need to dismount the OS to perform DD?
2012-11-20T11:16:00.000Z	SpecialEd		its a vm so there isn't /dev/sda1
2012-11-20T11:17:00.000Z	SpecialEd		./dev/simfs      200G   34G  167G  17% /
2012-11-20T11:17:00.000Z	SpecialEd		thats what i get from df -h
2012-11-20T11:17:00.000Z	dr_willis	SpecialEd	 or to image to a file... dd if=/dev/sda1 of=/media/somemountedpartiothatisnotsda1/file.image
2012-11-20T11:16:00.000Z	dr_willis	SpecialEd	  what are you trying do use for the if? your command is toally messed up
2012-11-20T11:16:00.000Z	dr_willis	SpecialEd	 dd if=/dev/sda1 of=/dev/sdb1  (to make a clone)
2012-11-20T11:16:00.000Z	SpecialEd	dr_willis	I am just trying to use dd to make a disk image of my VM's hard drive.  I do not have access to the host, just the guest
2012-11-20T11:17:00.000Z	dr_willis	SpecialEd	your use of / is wrong. You dont dd a path like that.
2012-11-20T11:18:00.000Z	dr_willis	SpecialEd	 whats simfs?
2012-11-20T11:18:00.000Z	SpecialEd	dr_willis	As previously stated this is a VM without access to the host therefore I can't add other media
2012-11-20T11:18:00.000Z	dr_willis	SpecialEd	 where are you putting the image at then?
2012-11-20T11:19:00.000Z	SpecialEd	dr_willis	to my new hosted dedicated server where I can have better control
2012-11-20T11:19:00.000Z	dr_willis	SpecialEd	 so you need to dd through a sshtunle/pipe to a different machine?
2012-11-20T11:20:00.000Z	SpecialEd	dr_willis	if i can have it write the dd to the same disk no, if i can't then yes i'll rsync through ssh tunnel
2012-11-20T11:20:00.000Z	dr_willis	SpecialEd	 that would be recursive.. and you dont want to image a filesystem thats getting written to
2012-11-20T11:21:00.000Z	dr_willis	SpecialEd	 a different partion/filesystem on the disk may work
2012-11-20T11:21:00.000Z	SpecialEd	dr_willis	I agree but Windows does it all the time with Shadow Copies...
