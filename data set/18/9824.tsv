2007-02-17T06:24:00.000Z	unop	Watakach	 mount your drive a read/write (on knoppix)
2007-02-17T06:24:00.000Z	Watakach	unop	i did chmod, but it doesnt want to change
2007-02-17T06:25:00.000Z	Watakach	unop	i cant write one this file...
2007-02-17T06:25:00.000Z	unop	Watakach	 no no, on the desktop, click your drive/device, right click, mount -> as read/write (or what it's named there)
2007-02-17T06:26:00.000Z	unop	Watakach	 knoppix mounts devices are read-only by default, if you want to change anything, you must remount them as read/write
2007-02-17T06:31:00.000Z	Watakach	unop	thx it wasnt put read write , but its steal downst make it.. but i will try other thigs now i can write.. i must go dinner see ya

2007-02-17T07:25:00.000Z	unop	Watakach	 hi :)
2007-02-17T07:26:00.000Z	Watakach	unop	so you were write it was in read only and coudlnt write..
2007-02-17T07:27:00.000Z	Watakach	unop	i put every possible write and then made a chmod, but it tell : "chmod:changing permissions of menu.lst : Read-only file system
2007-02-17T07:27:00.000Z	Watakach	unop	and it doesnt   change
2007-02-17T07:28:00.000Z	unop	Watakach	 you havent mounted the drive properly as "read/write" if its still complaining about a "Read-only file system" .. if you do a "mount" command, you should ideally see the drive marked "rw"
2007-02-17T07:29:00.000Z	Watakach	unop	ok
2007-02-17T07:29:00.000Z	Watakach	unop	so i should make a unmount and the remount the  disk ?
