2012-06-13T22:37:00.000Z	xGrub11	jondoe2	or could you teach me how to install a tarball?
2012-06-13T22:38:00.000Z	jondoe2	xGrub11	what do you want to install?
2012-06-13T22:39:00.000Z	jondoe2	xGrub11	first do tar zxfv kanatest-0.4.8.tar.gz
2012-06-13T22:41:00.000Z	jondoe2	xGrub11	you do not need to install from tarball though
2012-06-13T22:42:00.000Z	jondoe2	xGrub11	you can do        sudo apt-get install kanatest
2012-06-13T22:43:00.000Z	xGrub11	jondoe2	ok wait i though my GTK+ doesn't upgraded yet... it stop after ./configure... it can't do "make"...
2012-06-13T22:43:00.000Z	jondoe2	xGrub11	ok you better try          sudo apt-get install kanatest
2012-06-13T22:44:00.000Z	jondoe2	xGrub11	hmmm. what gtk+ is missing?
2012-06-13T22:45:00.000Z	jondoe2	xGrub11	usually when you install something with apt-get, you see something like These programs will be installed: libasd libasdf2 and so on
2012-06-13T22:47:00.000Z	jondoe2	xGrub11	I think you need   libgtk-3-0
2012-06-13T22:47:00.000Z	jondoe2	xGrub11	you need   libgtk2.0-0
2012-06-13T22:48:00.000Z	jondoe2	xGrub11	here you can see what is needed: http://pkgs.org/ubuntu-11.04/ubuntu-universe-i386/kanatest_0.4.8-2_i386.deb.html#requires
2012-06-13T22:51:00.000Z	jondoe2	xGrub11	do try      sudo apt-get build-dep kanatest
