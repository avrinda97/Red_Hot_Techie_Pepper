2009-02-19T00:43:00.000Z	fde	pop79	are you using fglrx or radeon driver?
2009-02-19T00:44:00.000Z	pop79	fde	fglrx i think :)
2009-02-19T00:44:00.000Z	fde	pop79	don't guess... cat /var/log/Xorg.0.log | grep -i fglrx return anything? how about lsmod | grep -i fglrx ?
2009-02-19T00:45:00.000Z	fde	pop79	in Applications > Accessories > Terminal ... copy and paste those commands...
2009-02-19T00:45:00.000Z	fde	pop79	cat /var/log/Xorg.0.log | grep -i fglrx and lsmod | grep -i fglrx
2009-02-19T00:46:00.000Z	pop79	fde	ill post the result in pastebin, wait...

2009-02-19T00:49:00.000Z	fde	pop79	these are not the commands I told you... you forget the grep part of the xorg log
2009-02-19T00:54:00.000Z	fde	pop79	so.... you gonna give me those commands output any time soon?
2009-02-19T00:54:00.000Z	pop79	fde	one minute...
2009-02-19T00:55:00.000Z	fde	pop79	cat /var/log/Xorg.0.log | grep -i fglrx && lsmod | grep -i fglrx <--- copy and paste everything between the first c and the last x, paste this output to your fav pastebin

2009-02-19T00:59:00.000Z	fde	pop79	that looks like it should be fine... hmm... does 'glxinfo | grep direct' return yes?
2009-02-19T01:00:00.000Z	pop79	fde	it returns "Yes"
2009-02-19T01:01:00.000Z	fde	pop79	then I am not sure why you would get flickers... and there is nothing we can do considering its proprietary
