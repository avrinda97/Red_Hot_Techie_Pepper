2007-04-09T13:28:00.000Z	flyte		!mail server
2007-04-09T13:28:00.000Z	flyte		I want to install a mail server on my edgy box. Any suggestions on where to start?
2007-04-09T13:29:00.000Z	SheaTara	flyte	Do you want to send mail or have your own mailbox?
2007-04-09T13:29:00.000Z	SheaTara	flyte	they are differenjt programs..
2007-04-09T13:30:00.000Z	flyte	SheaTara	I would  like to have my own mailbox associated with my domain
2007-04-09T13:30:00.000Z	SheaTara	flyte	Then you want both probably
2007-04-09T13:30:00.000Z	SheaTara	flyte	I use exim4 and courier
2007-04-09T13:31:00.000Z	SheaTara	flyte	do you want to download your messages to your mail client and then read them or do you want them to stay on the server most of the time (different protocols)
2007-04-09T13:32:00.000Z	flyte	SheaTara	hrm, I would like the messages to be download to a client (mail gets stored on the ubuntu web server) and then download to client on windows.
2007-04-09T13:32:00.000Z	SheaTara	flyte	I recommend this for most use: Exim4 and Courier-Pop
2007-04-09T13:33:00.000Z	SheaTara	flyte	I think courier has courier-imap, but I have never used it
2007-04-09T13:33:00.000Z	flyte	SheaTara	thanks for the recommendation. I will investigate these two further. Any guides on them?
2007-04-09T13:33:00.000Z	SheaTara	flyte	gazillions, just google
2007-04-09T13:34:00.000Z	flyte	SheaTara	micahcowan , which combo is the easiest to install?
2007-04-09T13:34:00.000Z	SheaTara	flyte	I used Exim, and I found it quite challenging.
2007-04-09T13:35:00.000Z	SheaTara	flyte	the courier part was not that hard though. If you want to use a database for authentication, you will want to know sql
2007-04-09T13:37:00.000Z	flyte	SheaTara	micahcowan, thanks for your help.
