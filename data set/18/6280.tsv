2008-06-02T11:12:00.000Z	DaveyJ		is it?
2008-06-02T11:12:00.000Z	DaveyJ		i dont know
2008-06-02T11:12:00.000Z	DaveyJ		sorry! :)
2008-06-02T11:13:00.000Z	DaveyJ		its a habit. -- anyway, if i stop a song or something, and then go to play it again, nothing comes out. or if i use whatever flash player in firefox for youtube or whatever, amarok stops working
2008-06-02T11:15:00.000Z	DaveyJ		alright just installed that, will that get my now-defunct sound to work again without having to reboot?'
2008-06-02T11:15:00.000Z	DaveyJ		this actually freezes up amarok when the sound doesnt work
2008-06-02T11:16:00.000Z	DaveyJ		its like the sound module is constantly busy or something. if i tried to use xmms (before i reinstalled ubuntu), it'd say there was no sound driver available
2008-06-02T11:16:00.000Z	DaveyJ		8.04
2008-06-02T11:17:00.000Z	DaveyJ		even VLC doesnt have sound
2008-06-02T11:17:00.000Z	DaveyJ		when i do what it says to do on the bug page the sound still works
2008-06-02T11:18:00.000Z	glitsj16	DaveyJ	that's because flash has taken over evrything, follow DanaG's tip
2008-06-02T11:19:00.000Z	glitsj16	DaveyJ	take out libflashsupport, follow the advice here if the bug page is too long, part B http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=4928900
2008-06-02T11:30:00.000Z	glitsj16	DaveyJ	did you remove libflashsupport and nspluginwrapper as per instructions ?
2008-06-02T11:30:00.000Z	glitsj16	DaveyJ	and pulseaudio daemon is running ?
2008-06-02T11:31:00.000Z	glitsj16	DaveyJ	better follow all parts of that page, checking is knowing ;)
2008-06-02T11:32:00.000Z	glitsj16	DaveyJ	okay, that's crucial if you use pulseaudio
2008-06-02T11:35:00.000Z	glitsj16	DaveyJ	http://www.pulseaudio.org/wiki/PerfectSetup is the official wiki page where the ubuntuforum page refers to, it has oads of tips to try for specific players
2008-06-02T11:39:00.000Z	glitsj16	DaveyJ	yes it takes a clear head and some time, goodluck
