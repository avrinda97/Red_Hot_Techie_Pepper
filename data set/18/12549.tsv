2007-05-04T08:21:00.000Z	felix_		maybe someone can help, I've been looking for a winamp like alternative to rhythmbox, I've got audacious and xmms installed at the moment  but in both of these I can't find a media library window like winamp has, any suggestions?
2007-05-04T08:21:00.000Z	orbin	felix_	enable the playlist
2007-05-04T08:22:00.000Z	felix_	orbin	usually the playlist has fewer or select songs than are in the library
2007-05-04T08:24:00.000Z	orbin	felix_	well xmms etc are basically winamp classic.  tried other alternative players like listen or banshee?
2007-05-04T08:25:00.000Z	felix_	orbin	I've been trying listen
2007-05-04T08:25:00.000Z	orbin	felix_	or amarok
2007-05-04T08:25:00.000Z	felix_	orbin	i suspect amarok will solve all my problems but the hefty download size of 46mb on ubuntu is delaying me
2007-05-04T08:27:00.000Z	felix_	orbin	does amarok work on gnome?
2007-05-04T08:28:00.000Z	orbin	felix_	yes, apt will grab the required kde libs.  just as gnome apps can work in kde or xfce for that matter.
2007-05-04T08:28:00.000Z	felix_	orbin	thanks, I'll try that.
2007-05-04T08:28:00.000Z	orbin	felix_	how are you finding listen?  i quite like it but keep going back to just plain bmp.  (audacious seems sluggish on my pc)
2007-05-04T08:29:00.000Z	felix_	orbin	I didn't use listen more than a few hours after I couldn't find a library
2007-05-04T08:30:00.000Z	orbin	felix_	couldn't find?  don't you just set it in prefs?
2007-05-04T08:31:00.000Z	felix_	orbin	um, what, I looked but didn't see the option. Let me check again real quick :P
2007-05-04T08:31:00.000Z	orbin	felix_	music > prefs > library tab?
2007-05-04T08:32:00.000Z	felix_	orbin	oh yeah i did that but I'd really prefer something that brings up a seperate library window that has easy search of the whole library and playlist selection.
2007-05-04T08:34:00.000Z	felix_	orbin	thanks for the advice, I've got to go.
2007-05-04T08:34:00.000Z	orbin	felix_	sure, bye.
