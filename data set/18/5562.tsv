2010-05-19T09:43:00.000Z	Solaris444		is it looking for a particular firmware?
2010-05-19T09:44:00.000Z	Solaris444		did you add a repository and download the driver, or perhaps compile the driver from source?
2010-05-19T09:44:00.000Z	Docteh	Solaris444	you should address that to merculiv
2010-05-19T09:44:00.000Z	Solaris444		the is precedent Docteh
2010-05-19T09:45:00.000Z	Solaris444		Microsoft pushed out their Windows .Net Assistant through Windows Update to Firefox users.
2010-05-19T09:45:00.000Z	Solaris444		I don't. ;-)
2010-05-19T09:45:00.000Z	Solaris444		So Outta Luck
2010-05-19T09:46:00.000Z	Docteh	Solaris444	and mozilla blacklisted them for thier trouble
2010-05-19T09:46:00.000Z	Solaris444	Docteh	 Sadly not.  The addon was only blacklisted because a particular version had security issues.  The current version of the .Net assistant still installs
2010-05-19T09:47:00.000Z	Solaris444		So I would say if push came to shove that Microsoft is not above making other people's programs not work.
2010-05-19T09:47:00.000Z	Solaris444		After all, part of the design docs for Vista were "f*** with Samba"
2010-05-19T09:47:00.000Z	Solaris444		Samba still doesn't work properly with Win7.
2010-05-19T09:48:00.000Z	Docteh		I can access my samba server from windows 7
2010-05-19T09:48:00.000Z	Solaris444		Try using it as a file server.
2010-05-19T09:48:00.000Z	Docteh		do you mean the other way around?
2010-05-19T09:48:00.000Z	Solaris444		Or keeping your profile on it.
2010-05-19T09:49:00.000Z	Solaris444		I can assure you, there are a number of known issues with Win7 and Samba that make it unsuitable to be a full-time file server (especially if you have remote profiles enabled)
2010-05-19T09:49:00.000Z	Docteh	Solaris444	just sounds like microsoft wants to keep the open source developers employed
