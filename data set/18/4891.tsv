2009-01-20T07:16:00.000Z	shagoth		I'm having weird routing issues over my wifi.
2009-01-20T07:16:00.000Z	shagoth		i can't consistently reach sshd or even ping my server, though for reasons unknown samba routes.
2009-01-20T07:18:00.000Z	shagoth		if this isn't the place to ask for help on routing issues, i'd be happy to head elsewhere, thoughts?
2009-01-20T07:18:00.000Z	mindrape	shagoth	- describe your routing issues.
2009-01-20T07:19:00.000Z	mindrape	shagoth	- ping google.com         it dont work?
2009-01-20T07:20:00.000Z	mindrape	shagoth	- are you pinging from a wireless device?
2009-01-20T07:20:00.000Z	mindrape	shagoth	- your router may have AP isolation mode set.
2009-01-20T07:21:00.000Z	shagoth	mindrape	it doesn't appear so.
2009-01-20T07:25:00.000Z	shagoth	mindrape	it absolutely isn't isolating the wireless from the LAN, besides samba works over the wifi to the same server that won't ping
2009-01-20T07:26:00.000Z	mindrape	shagoth	route -FC
2009-01-20T07:33:00.000Z	shagoth	mindrape	what am I looking for?
2009-01-20T07:33:00.000Z	mindrape	shagoth	- uhmmm... you were the routing issue, right?
2009-01-20T07:33:00.000Z	shagoth	mindrape	yes
2009-01-20T07:33:00.000Z	shagoth	mindrape	I don't see a route to the server, needless to say.
2009-01-20T07:34:00.000Z	mindrape	shagoth	- well thats problemo numero uno.  :)
2009-01-20T07:34:00.000Z	mindrape	shagoth	- iptables -L   any rulesets blocking ping?
2009-01-20T07:35:00.000Z	shagoth	mindrape	nope. not on either box.
2009-01-20T07:40:00.000Z	shagoth	mindrape	routing was add the wrinkle that the server on the wire can ping the machines on the wifi but not vice versa.
