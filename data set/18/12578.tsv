2006-05-23T11:07:00.000Z	harisund	jmoncayo	do you mean bad package?
2006-05-23T11:09:00.000Z	jmoncayo	harisund	i downloaded a newer version of a program i already have installed, it is the deb package, how can i upgrade
2006-05-23T11:09:00.000Z	harisund	jmoncayo	use "dpkg --install <name of the deb file>.deb
2006-05-23T11:10:00.000Z	jmoncayo	harisund	will that upgrade the package?
2006-05-23T11:11:00.000Z	harisund	jmoncayo	typically if you have the dependancies it should.
2006-05-23T11:12:00.000Z	harisund	jmoncayo	just try doing that and see if it gets installed. If it couldn't it would tell you what else you need.
2006-05-23T11:13:00.000Z	harisund	jmoncayo	all the better.just do 'dpkg -i package.deb'
2006-05-23T11:14:00.000Z	jmoncayo	harisund	i am going to that after apt-get upgrade finishes
2006-05-23T11:14:00.000Z	harisund	jmoncayo	yes, dpkg wouldn't allow you to install a deb file when apt is running.
2006-05-23T11:21:00.000Z	jmoncayo	harisund	i think everything went well
2006-05-23T11:23:00.000Z	jmoncayo	harisund	everything ok right?
2006-05-23T11:23:00.000Z	harisund	jmoncayo	from whta I see in the #flood channel, it looks like everything installed fine.
2006-05-23T11:24:00.000Z	harisund	jmoncayo	what are you trying to do? First, do you have the X windows running? That is a typical error while trying sometihng like X Forward
2006-05-23T11:25:00.000Z	jmoncayo	harisund	done i didnt realize i still was logged in as root
2006-05-23T11:26:00.000Z	harisund	jmoncayo	whoa ! be careful.. you would be better off doing stuff as regular user and using sudo instead of actually 'logging in as root'
2006-05-23T11:28:00.000Z	jmoncayo	harisund	well i think it is a bad thing i like to do but i will start doing things with sudo
2006-05-23T11:30:00.000Z	jmoncayo	harisund	ok buddy thanks a lot
