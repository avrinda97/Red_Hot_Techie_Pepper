2004-09-13T10:43:00.000Z	lamont__	mdz	what's the current thinking on ruby1.8?
2004-09-13T10:44:00.000Z	mdz	lamont__	you requested a sync, and I approved it
2004-09-13T08:42:00.000Z	lamont__	mdz	around?
2004-09-13T12:08:00.000Z	mdz	lamont__	ping
2004-09-13T12:19:00.000Z	lamont__	mdz	yo
2004-09-13T12:20:00.000Z	mdz	lamont__	what's the story on those tetex bugs?  I thought we synched those
2004-09-13T12:21:00.000Z	lamont__	mdz	I was working on looking at them to confirm that they were really dead before I closed them.  I'll force it above the cutline after my late lunch today.
2004-09-13T15:49:00.000Z	lamont__	mdz	about
2004-09-22T05:02:00.000Z	lamont__	mdz	yet another initrd-tools uploaded
2004-09-26T15:00:00.000Z	lamont__	mdz	just waking up, or are you still fighting sleep
2004-09-26T15:09:00.000Z	lamont__	mdz	eta for an rc?
2004-09-26T15:10:00.000Z	mdz	lamont__	on or about Warty final
2004-09-26T15:12:00.000Z	mdz	lamont__	#1257 headed your way
2004-09-26T15:17:00.000Z	mdz	lamont__	certainly
2004-09-26T15:50:00.000Z	lamont__	mdz	definitely
2004-09-28T16:54:00.000Z	lamont__	mdz	and I think it's just a matter of sync'ing the package
2004-09-28T16:55:00.000Z	lamont__	mdz	the other question is whether or not OO.o should depend on the spell package, rather than suggest...
2004-09-28T05:19:00.000Z	lamont__	mdz	I think it'll be a 2-line patch: gotta disable autoconnecting to debian, and enable autoconnecting to ubuntu...
