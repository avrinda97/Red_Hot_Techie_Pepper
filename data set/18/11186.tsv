2006-08-31T05:05:00.000Z	SneSSiRaM		Hi, I'm new to ubuntu, I just tried installing ies4linux (for webdesign purposes), but the install terminal just dissapeears when extracting the cab files, although cabextracter is installed, anyone experience with this?
2006-08-31T05:05:00.000Z	Arafangion	SneSSiRaM	The install terminal disappears?
2006-08-31T05:06:00.000Z	Arafangion	SneSSiRaM	How are you installing it?
2006-08-31T05:07:00.000Z	Arafangion	SneSSiRaM	Ahh, there ya go.
2006-08-31T05:07:00.000Z	Arafangion	SneSSiRaM	Bring up a terminal, and type it in yourself.
2006-08-31T05:07:00.000Z	Arafangion	SneSSiRaM	That way, it has a chance to _ask_ you critical questions, and give you output.
2006-08-31T05:08:00.000Z	Arafangion	SneSSiRaM	It's not a graphical program.
2006-08-31T05:08:00.000Z	Arafangion	SneSSiRaM	Find out :)
2006-08-31T05:09:00.000Z	Arafangion	SneSSiRaM	(For example, it asks you which versions of ie you want to install)
2006-08-31T05:12:00.000Z	SneSSiRaM	Arafangion	you would suggest me a complete manual install of IE? (and if so, do you know a guide or something to help me)
2006-08-31T05:12:00.000Z	Arafangion	SneSSiRaM	Personally, I run Win98 and WinXP within Qemu + Kqemu
2006-08-31T05:13:00.000Z	Arafangion	SneSSiRaM	It's a very heavy-handed approach, though.  I can verify that ie4linux works flawlessly on Ubuntu Dapper.
2006-08-31T05:13:00.000Z	Arafangion	SneSSiRaM	At least, ie 6 installs without any issue whatsoever.
2006-08-31T05:14:00.000Z	Arafangion	SneSSiRaM	I prefer the reverse operation ;)
2006-08-31T05:17:00.000Z	Arafangion	SneSSiRaM	I used the default version of cabextractor that ubuntu has.
2006-08-31T05:17:00.000Z	Arafangion	SneSSiRaM	apt-get install cabextractor.
2006-08-31T05:19:00.000Z	SneSSiRaM	Arafangion	I installed cabextractor through package manager (I even think it was installed indeed), now I just tried through terminal and it said couldn't find package
2006-08-31T05:20:00.000Z	Arafangion	SneSSiRaM	Show me the error please. (Use the pastebin!)
