2010-03-24T01:29:00.000Z	Losha	alex__c2022	you have control over what the tar.gz files are named e.g. tar -cvz foo1 > foo1.tar.gz but it's a weird thing to do to use tar for a single file, the whole point of tar is it handles sets of files. Are you sure you don't just want to use gzip on the whole directory to compress each file individually?
2010-03-24T01:30:00.000Z	alex__c2022		well the files are pretty big
2010-03-24T01:30:00.000Z	alex__c2022		200mb text files
2010-03-24T01:30:00.000Z	alex__c2022		i could put them all in one archive i guess
2010-03-24T01:31:00.000Z	alex__c2022		i just don't want to have to name them one by one since there are alot of them
2010-03-24T01:32:00.000Z	alex__c2022		are .tar.gz and .tgz the same thing?
2010-03-24T01:32:00.000Z	alex__c2022		same format
2010-03-24T01:32:00.000Z	alex__c2022		thanks
2010-03-24T01:33:00.000Z	Losha	alex__c2022	step back a moment and tell us exactly what you want to do, in case there's a better solution. So far I know you have a lot of 200mb text files, and you want to do what? Back them up somewhere? Copy them to a different machine. Just have them take less space? What?
2010-03-24T01:34:00.000Z	Losha	alex__c2022	.tar.gz and .tgz are the same thing. They don't mean anything in themselves, they're just a naming convention people follow so they know by looking what kind of format the files are in...
2010-03-24T01:35:00.000Z	alex__c2022	Losha	yes, I need to scp them to a different server. I guess im just going to batch the files. ie) put foo1 ... foo10 in one archive and foo11 to foo20 into another, etc
2010-03-24T01:35:00.000Z	alex__c2022		im going to delete the originals
2010-03-24T01:35:00.000Z	alex__c2022		because im running out of space
2010-03-24T01:37:00.000Z	Losha	alex__c2022	you can just scp -r the entire directory to another machine and they'll get copied. The -C flag will compress them for transmission and expand them again on the other side (trading cpu time off for faster transmission speeds) transparently. No need to mess with tar at all. Will that satisfy?
2010-03-24T01:38:00.000Z	alex__c2022	Losha	cool, I didn't know scp supported that option. Is there a way for scp to not uncompress ? and keep the files compress on the machine they are transferred to?
2010-03-24T01:42:00.000Z	Losha	alex__c2022	no, to do that, you should compress the files in place on the source before scp'ing them (and when you scp, *don't* use -C, since trying to compress already compressed files is a waste of time and ends up giving worse performance). Use something like 'gzip .' to compress all files in the directory. This will keep the names and just replace e.g foo with foo.gz. Try it by hand on a few files first to see how much compression
2010-03-24T01:42:00.000Z	Losha		you get...
2010-03-24T01:43:00.000Z	alex__c2022	Losha	thanks
