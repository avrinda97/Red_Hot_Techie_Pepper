2008-07-02T03:57:00.000Z	unop	onthefence928	right your UUID will be different
2008-07-02T03:58:00.000Z	unop	onthefence928	have you run mkswap on the partition you have dedicated for swap there?
2008-07-02T03:59:00.000Z	onthefence928	unop	no
2008-07-02T03:59:00.000Z	onthefence928	unop	what does it do?
2008-07-02T03:59:00.000Z	unop	onthefence928	it setups the partition with a swap area ready to be used
2008-07-02T04:00:00.000Z	onthefence928	unop	the partition is alreayd designated for swap last i checked
2008-07-02T04:00:00.000Z	unop	onthefence928	ohh well, i guess you don't need mkswap then -- but it can't hurt to run it again to make sure tho
2008-07-02T04:03:00.000Z	unop	onthefence928	nickrud_ - that indicates that the partition is a swap type -- but the actual filesystem could be anything but swap
2008-07-02T04:05:00.000Z	unop	onthefence928	it sounds good
2008-07-02T04:05:00.000Z	onthefence928	unop	nickrud_, what next?
2008-07-02T04:06:00.000Z	unop	onthefence928	swapon -s  # to see a list of swap devices, just to make sure it has been activated
2008-07-02T04:07:00.000Z	onthefence928	unop	it doesn't list anything
2008-07-02T04:07:00.000Z	unop	onthefence928	ok, do that nickrud_ just suggested
2008-07-02T04:11:00.000Z	onthefence928	unop	nickrud_,
2008-07-21T05:33:00.000Z	unop	onthefence928	FAT volumes shouldn't need defragging under linux -- not sure about NTFS, afaik, there are no defrag tools for NTFS on linux (atleast ones that do an actual defrag)
2008-09-30T03:14:00.000Z	unop	onthefence928	move the ~/.wine directory to the new partition and leave behind a symlink pointing to the new location
2008-09-30T03:14:00.000Z	onthefence928	unop	how do i "leave behind a symlink"
2008-09-30T03:15:00.000Z	unop	onthefence928	not sure using the GUI - but  at the command line.  ln -s /path/to/new/.wine ~/.wine
