2009-09-06T04:12:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter		running command echo $DISPLAY gives me a blank line does that mean i can't forward X applications?
2009-09-06T04:13:00.000Z	zamba	Pirate_Hunter	over ssh?
2009-09-06T04:13:00.000Z	zamba	Pirate_Hunter	you did ssh -X?
2009-09-06T04:14:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	zamba	lstarnes: yeah I did the -X command still not sure why I got no display or how to fix it
2009-09-06T04:15:00.000Z	zamba	Pirate_Hunter	do you have installed the required binaries on the server?
2009-09-06T04:16:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	zamba	what are the required binaries other than openssh-server
2009-09-06T04:16:00.000Z	zamba	Pirate_Hunter	you need libraries for X
2009-09-06T04:16:00.000Z	zamba	Pirate_Hunter	of course :)
2009-09-06T04:17:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	zamba	I was told I didnt need to actually have x on the host machine which is something im trying to avoid due to is large dependencies and components
2009-09-06T04:17:00.000Z	zamba	Pirate_Hunter	you don't need X, but you need some required libraries
2009-09-06T04:18:00.000Z	zamba	Pirate_Hunter	try installing the xauth package on the server
2009-09-06T04:18:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	zamba	what does that contain?
2009-09-06T04:19:00.000Z	zamba	Pirate_Hunter	aptitude show xauth
2009-09-06T04:20:00.000Z	zamba	Pirate_Hunter	and that will pull with it x11-common, i believe
2009-09-06T04:21:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	zamba	actually it doesnt but it is installed will try now
2009-09-06T04:21:00.000Z	zamba	Pirate_Hunter	ok
