2008-01-28T21:33:00.000Z	wimpies		for an Intel 64 bit install, do I use the packages marked as amd64 ?
2008-01-28T21:33:00.000Z	adelie	wimpies	yes
2008-01-28T21:33:00.000Z	wimpies		Thx
2008-01-28T21:33:00.000Z	adelie	wimpies	assuming you used the 64bit base install
2008-01-28T21:34:00.000Z	wimpies		also, is it already stable enough to install hardy ?
2008-01-28T21:34:00.000Z	adelie	wimpies	no
2008-01-28T21:35:00.000Z	wimpies		ok gutsy it is then ...
2008-01-28T21:35:00.000Z	adelie	wimpies	ubuntu web site strongly recommends against "upgrading" until the release if you value your computer working on a regular basis, or if you need to get to your data all the time
2008-01-28T21:36:00.000Z	wimpies	adelie	: it is a fresh  install
2008-01-28T21:37:00.000Z	adelie	wimpies	if you want to have a good experience, go with a fresh gutsy install
2008-01-28T21:37:00.000Z	adelie		!hardy
2008-01-28T21:38:00.000Z	adelie		any experience here with swappiness?
2008-01-28T21:38:00.000Z	wimpies	adelie	: also, should I take the desktop or alternate image ? What is the difference ?
2008-01-28T21:41:00.000Z	adelie	wimpies	the desktop / live cd / dvd is very pretty and gives you a full working system... if the image on the disc works with your system. it is a full install on a CD that is mostly compatible. alternate is just packages, and only has a terminal mode install (no live desktop) and configures everything manually rather than just copying a working system to your hard drive. in my personal experience, alternate cd always works, IF it is going to work at all, 
2008-01-28T21:43:00.000Z	adelie	wimpies	I had thought that the alternate disc necessity to configure each package during install would mean that it would take longer, but that has not been my experience. live CD is great demo disc, and 'pretty looking', but alternate disc is 'get er` done' I just want to install disc.  :)
2008-01-28T21:44:00.000Z	adelie		does nobody have any experience with tweaking swappiness?
2008-01-28T21:45:00.000Z	wimpies	adelie	: th
2008-01-28T21:45:00.000Z	adelie	wimpies	have fun
