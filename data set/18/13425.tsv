2005-11-22T07:32:00.000Z	vtv_punisher		here. about applicatons not listing in the menu
2005-11-22T07:33:00.000Z	khermans	vtv_punisher	if it is in the menu editior, but not showing, do killall gnome-panel
2005-11-22T07:39:00.000Z	vtv_punisher	khermans	the killall command did now work
2005-11-22T07:40:00.000Z	khermans	vtv_punisher	well tyr kill -9
2005-11-22T07:40:00.000Z	khermans	vtv_punisher	kill -9 <process id>
2005-11-22T07:44:00.000Z	vtv_punisher	khermans	does restarting do anything for the app menu groups. ?
2005-11-22T07:45:00.000Z	khermans	vtv_punisher	killall gnome-panel
2005-11-22T07:47:00.000Z	vtv_punisher	khermans	did it again there still not showing up
2005-11-22T07:48:00.000Z	khermans	vtv_punisher	it is possible that it your app doesnt install itself into the app menu
2005-11-22T07:49:00.000Z	khermans	vtv_punisher	you could try rebooting, but i dont see how that is different from restart gnome-panel
2005-11-22T07:49:00.000Z	khermans	vtv_punisher	try CTRL-ALT-BACKSPACE to kill x
2005-11-22T08:00:00.000Z	vtv_punisher	khermans	back. only one of the apps started, others not there still placed a split and apps above it split is there apps not
2005-11-22T08:01:00.000Z	khermans	vtv_punisher	dunno
2005-11-22T08:05:00.000Z	vtv_punisher	khermans	there is the best way
