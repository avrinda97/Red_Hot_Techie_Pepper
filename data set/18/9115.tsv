2007-07-20T14:39:00.000Z	r00723r0		i have a question
2007-07-20T14:39:00.000Z	r00723r0		ddclient is just a cronjob right?
2007-07-20T14:39:00.000Z	r00723r0		basically?
2007-07-20T14:39:00.000Z	thedonvaughn	r00723r0	ddclient is a script.  u can put in as a cronjob if you want to run it regularly
2007-07-20T14:40:00.000Z	r00723r0	thedonvaughn	the way it works
2007-07-20T14:40:00.000Z	r00723r0	thedonvaughn	does it run commands as soon as the ip is changed, or does it work every 10 minutes or something like that
2007-07-20T14:40:00.000Z	thedonvaughn	r00723r0	uhm there is no ddclient deamon.. it's a perl script
2007-07-20T14:41:00.000Z	thedonvaughn	r00723r0	nope it runs only when u run it
2007-07-20T14:41:00.000Z	thedonvaughn	r00723r0	atleast i don't have a daemon.  my ddclient is just a perl script
2007-07-20T14:41:00.000Z	thedonvaughn	r00723r0	oh you're right you can run it like that..
2007-07-20T14:42:00.000Z	thedonvaughn	r00723r0	not sure if it periodically checks or if it wakes up if your device changes.. check the code :)
2007-07-20T14:42:00.000Z	r00723r0	thedonvaughn	it is 4:42 am and i will do ANYTHING necessary not to spend any effort
2007-07-20T14:43:00.000Z	thedonvaughn	r00723r0	looks like every 180 seconds it checks
2007-07-20T14:44:00.000Z	r00723r0	thedonvaughn	that's lame as hell
2007-07-20T14:44:00.000Z	r00723r0	thedonvaughn	i get to remove ddclient now
2007-07-20T14:44:00.000Z	thedonvaughn	r00723r0	in fact if you do "ps auwx" while it's running it should say how long it's sleeping.
2007-07-20T14:44:00.000Z	thedonvaughn	r00723r0	yah it's a quickly written perl script.. watta-ya-gona-do?
2007-07-20T14:45:00.000Z	thedonvaughn	r00723r0	ps auwx|grep ddclient
