2007-02-23T16:56:00.000Z	RobinLionheart		Any debian packages of the interactive fiction terp Gargoyle?
2007-02-23T16:57:00.000Z	RobinLionheart		I'd really like to see that make the Ubuntu repositories sometime
2007-02-23T16:57:00.000Z	RobinLionheart		So I can play the games in the annual interactive fiction competitions
2007-02-23T16:58:00.000Z	RobinLionheart		Yeah, there is because Linux Mint installs one
2007-02-23T16:58:00.000Z	linxeh	RobinLionheart	was that at me?
2007-02-23T16:59:00.000Z	linxeh	RobinLionheart	yeah, I know there is realplayer for linux, I just wondered if there is an official package
2007-02-23T17:00:00.000Z	linxeh	RobinLionheart	what is that? I have multiverse and universe enabled
2007-02-24T17:01:00.000Z	linxeh	RobinLionheart	ok many thanks :)
2007-02-24T17:02:00.000Z	linxeh	RobinLionheart	many thanks, working great
2007-02-24T17:06:00.000Z	linxeh	RobinLionheart	most things work better in linux than vista :)
2007-02-24T17:07:00.000Z	RobinLionheart	linxeh	Well, maybe not my Nvidia Geforce Go display adapter, but everything else
2007-02-24T17:07:00.000Z	linxeh	RobinLionheart	really? I've had no problems on the dell  laptop I tried on - can't remember which go it was though (about a year old)
2007-02-24T17:07:00.000Z	RobinLionheart	linxeh	I tried to set up Beryl but Ubuntu Edgy's got an old version of the adapter that messes things up
2007-02-24T17:08:00.000Z	linxeh	RobinLionheart	so your card isnt fully supported in the edgy driver?
2007-02-24T17:09:00.000Z	linxeh	RobinLionheart	yeah, kernel driver issues. its a right PITA to fix it. I managed it by going back to the nv driver, then rebooting using an old kernel, uninstalling all the nvidia-glx packages and the linux-restricted-modules-common/k7 packages, then apt-get clean, then reinstalling them all
2007-02-24T17:11:00.000Z	linxeh	RobinLionheart	well, it worked using the latest repository driver
2007-02-24T17:11:00.000Z	linxeh	RobinLionheart	but if your card doesnt work with that driver I guess you'd need to manually install the latest nvidia driver
2007-02-24T17:12:00.000Z	linxeh	RobinLionheart	the GDM issue you had is almost certainly due to the driver not having the right kernel module available, or that it wasnt built at boot (check /etc/default/linux-restricted-modules to make sure that there isnt a line with "nv" in it)
