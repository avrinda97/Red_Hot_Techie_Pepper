2011-01-07T04:35:00.000Z	Citizenwarrior		Just replaced my 3GB of RAM with 4GB of RAM and on boot if I F2 into my system the bios shows 4GB of RAM but my Ubuntu 10.04  2.6.32-27-generic only shos 3.0GiB of Memory under system monitor... I have rebooted a few times... Whats Up?
2011-01-07T04:36:00.000Z	DarkStar1	Citizenwarrior	Is it 32/64 bit ubuntu?
2011-01-07T04:39:00.000Z	Citizenwarrior	DarkStar1	bummer... so was that a wast of cash or will I see any improvement
2011-01-07T04:40:00.000Z	DarkStar1	Citizenwarrior	Or you could update to 64bit OS..
2011-01-07T04:41:00.000Z	DarkStar1	Citizenwarrior	I hardly doubt that.. Unles you're using pre 2002 hardware
2011-01-07T04:42:00.000Z	Citizenwarrior	DarkStar1	I was going to do some Virtual Box stuff
2011-01-07T04:43:00.000Z	DarkStar1	Citizenwarrior	Virtualising, How many VMs you plan on spawning, and what OS'es you plan on running
2011-01-07T04:44:00.000Z	DarkStar1	Citizenwarrior	It depends on what you want to do on your host OS.
2011-01-07T04:45:00.000Z	Citizenwarrior	DarkStar1	is there a command to get my system to return if it is 32/64... VB of Windows for testing and a few other projects
2011-01-07T04:45:00.000Z	DarkStar1	Citizenwarrior	If your Host OS is windows and you plan on spawning multiple windows OS VMs then...... I'd say good luck
2011-01-07T04:46:00.000Z	Citizenwarrior	DarkStar1	No I am running Ubuntu 10.04, want to VB a window in it... I don't have any windows boxs
2011-01-07T04:47:00.000Z	DarkStar1	Citizenwarrior	Ifit's just that you hardly need more than the 3GB. unless you plan on running some silly resource hogging games in your windows VM
2011-01-07T04:47:00.000Z	Citizenwarrior	DarkStar1	Ok thanks for your time
2011-01-07T04:48:00.000Z	DarkStar1	Citizenwarrior	also I think uname -a should provide some info as to whether it's 32/64 bit
2011-01-07T04:48:00.000Z	DarkStar1	Citizenwarrior	Or is it uname -v
2011-01-07T04:52:00.000Z	DarkStar1	Citizenwarrior	Yeah ignarps is a better solution.. Forgot about that command :D
2011-01-07T04:53:00.000Z	Citizenwarrior	DarkStar1	It's cool if none of us ever forgot anything then we wouldn't need to chat here
2011-01-07T04:54:00.000Z	DarkStar1	Citizenwarrior	We'd still have to chat. We of course come here to learn also
