2005-07-07T12:05:00.000Z	unome	agwibowo	let me ask you a stupid question, your speakers and headset both were working fine under doze?
2005-07-07T12:06:00.000Z	agwibowo	unome	yes
2005-07-07T12:06:00.000Z	agwibowo	unome	the only stupid mistake of mine was to plug in the headphone during the installation.... and now ubuntu only wants to output the sound from that port
2005-07-07T12:06:00.000Z	unome	agwibowo	ok, great. Now, if you move your speakers plug to the front were the headset was pluged, do they work?
2005-07-07T12:07:00.000Z	agwibowo	unome	yes
2005-07-07T12:09:00.000Z	agwibowo	unome	it works when i plug in the speaker to front... but then there would be cable lying around.... not nice.... :(
