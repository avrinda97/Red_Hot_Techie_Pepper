2010-01-11T09:55:00.000Z	MachinTruc		hi
2010-01-11T09:56:00.000Z	MachinTruc		I deleted the partitions on an external usb hdd, then left it as unformatted. now when i plug it back in (to format it), it's no longer detected.
2010-01-11T09:56:00.000Z	MachinTruc		so i can't use gparted to format it
2010-01-11T09:57:00.000Z	mezquitale	MachinTruc	check on the upper right corner, you should be able to change the hard drive from maybe sda1 to sda2
2010-01-11T09:58:00.000Z	MachinTruc	mezquitale	that's what i mean, it no longer shows up there
2010-01-11T09:58:00.000Z	mezquitale	MachinTruc	have you tried a live CD?
2010-01-11T09:58:00.000Z	MachinTruc	mezquitale	used to show up as sdc until 5 mins ago. now i just have sda and sdb (my two main drives).
2010-01-11T09:58:00.000Z	MachinTruc	mezquitale	nope, just ubuntu.
2010-01-11T09:59:00.000Z	mezquitale	MachinTruc	can you list your hard drive using lsusb?
2010-01-11T10:01:00.000Z	MachinTruc	mezquitale	don't see it. tons of generic "linux foundation root hub" , one mouse, one keyboard
2010-01-11T10:01:00.000Z	mezquitale	MachinTruc	also try hitting "refresh devices" in gparted
2010-01-11T10:01:00.000Z	MachinTruc	mezquitale	did that a long time ago. what's weird, Windows 7 also doesn't detect the drive.
2010-01-11T10:03:00.000Z	mezquitale	MachinTruc	disconnect the device and then remount your filesystems: "sudo mount -a", then do lsusb, then connect the device, then do lsbusb again and see if there's any difference from the first time you tried lsusb
2010-01-11T10:05:00.000Z	MachinTruc	mezquitale	that did it!
2010-01-11T10:05:00.000Z	mezquitale	MachinTruc	you can now see your drive in gparted?
2010-01-11T10:05:00.000Z	MachinTruc	mezquitale	out of curiosity what did we just do? what did remounting the fs do?
2010-01-11T10:05:00.000Z	MachinTruc	mezquitale	yes I can
2010-01-11T10:07:00.000Z	mezquitale	MachinTruc	machines get confused every now and then with devices like that, winblows blue screens, or simply fails and you have to reboot, what you basically did is unmounted your file systems, then remounted the file systems in your fstab config file, you had a clean system again without rebooting, then you put in your thumb drive again--this time you didnt confuse linux
