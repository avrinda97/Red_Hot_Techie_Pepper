2007-11-29T19:42:00.000Z	florian_		can anyone help me?
2007-11-29T19:42:00.000Z	florian_		i just startet my computer, and now xserver doest work proper any longer
2007-11-29T19:43:00.000Z	florian_		nvidia 6600GT, driver should be nvidia.
2007-11-29T19:45:00.000Z	rojo^	florian_	have you been using the driver from the Nvidia website / from envy, or have you been using nvidia-glx-new and linux-restricted-modules from the apt repos?  That is, up until you had to use vesa?
2007-11-29T19:47:00.000Z	rojo^	florian_	have you been using the driver from the Nvidia website / from envy, or have you been using nvidia-glx-new and linux-restricted-modules from the apt repos?  That is, up until you had to use vesa?
2007-11-29T19:47:00.000Z	florian_	rojo^	those in the repository.
2007-11-29T19:48:00.000Z	rojo^	florian_	Are you booting to console now?  What happens when you type "startx" as your regular user account?  Any appropriate error messages?
2007-11-29T19:51:00.000Z	rojo^	florian_	never used simple-backup.  I have a craptastic bash script I use to back up my junk.
2007-11-29T19:52:00.000Z	rojo^	florian_	so, you didn't answer my question earlier.  Any appropriate error messages result when running startx from the console?
2007-11-29T19:53:00.000Z	florian_	rojo^	excuse me, but my driver threw my out of the connection.
2007-11-29T19:53:00.000Z	florian_	rojo^	i will just try it
2007-11-29T19:54:00.000Z	florian_	rojo^	the logfiles don't tell anything about an error.
2007-11-29T19:55:00.000Z	rojo^	florian_	when you startx, X either dies, or you get a windowing system.  If X dies, it gives a reason why.  So, which is happening -- X is dying or X is launching as it should?  My humble apologies, but I must take a smoke break.  I'll be back in a few minutes
2007-11-29T19:56:00.000Z	florian_	rojo^	i had to log off this chat to see that.
2007-11-29T19:56:00.000Z	florian_	rojo^	x is running, but only with vesa.
2007-11-29T19:56:00.000Z	florian_	rojo^	i'll be back in some minutes.
2007-11-29T20:04:00.000Z	florian_	rojo^	/lib/modules/[kernel]/volatile/nvidia.ko is missing.
2007-11-29T20:04:00.000Z	florian_	rojo^	let's see if its in any of my backup archives
