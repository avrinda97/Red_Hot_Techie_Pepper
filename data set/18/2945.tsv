2010-01-19T17:05:00.000Z	jami	qualitang	give your rooter a few min to boot i mean
2010-01-19T17:07:00.000Z	qualitang	jami	no matter how long i wait, the network manager will just sit there, waiting for me to confirm the WEP key, i just have to press OK and it will reconnect, won't do it automatically, even though it already has the key...
2010-01-19T17:08:00.000Z	jami	qualitang	you have to save your password
2010-01-19T17:09:00.000Z	qualitang	jami	password is saved, it just waits for me to press OK to reconnect, i don't have to put the password in again..
2010-01-19T17:10:00.000Z	jami	qualitang	a mom i got that behaviour on my own
2010-01-19T17:11:00.000Z	jami	qualitang	but after a fail connection the NM works again

2010-01-19T17:50:00.000Z	jami	qualitang	Thats nice and will work because it will restart the nm. But what did it do when there is no network attached
