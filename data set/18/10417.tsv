2006-12-07T08:08:00.000Z	Randakar	SniZ	EE) NVIDIA(0): Failed to load the NVIDIA kernel module!
2006-12-07T08:09:00.000Z	Randakar	SniZ	Sounds like you need to install the linux-restricted-modules package
2006-12-07T08:10:00.000Z	SniZ	Randakar	wait. i try
2006-12-07T08:11:00.000Z	SniZ	Randakar	if i use i686 kernel, it cant load modules for i386?
2006-12-07T08:11:00.000Z	Randakar	SniZ	possibly
2006-12-07T08:11:00.000Z	SniZ	Randakar	wait. i try
2006-12-07T08:28:00.000Z	Randakar	SniZ	can you do a "aptitude search restricted-modules | grep -e '^i A'" ?
2006-12-07T08:29:00.000Z	SniZ	Randakar	i install all modules
2006-12-07T08:29:00.000Z	Randakar	SniZ	or just 'aptitude install linux-restricted-modules-2.6.17-10'
2006-12-07T08:29:00.000Z	Randakar	SniZ	that was not my question
2006-12-07T08:29:00.000Z	Randakar	SniZ	The error you're getting suggests the install you did didn't work somehow
2006-12-07T08:30:00.000Z	SniZ	Randakar	i use edgy
2006-12-07T08:31:00.000Z	Randakar	SniZ	still no guarantee you have that package installed ..
2006-12-07T08:33:00.000Z	SniZ	Randakar	i try "aptitude install linux-restricted-modules-2.6.17-10", but not found this
