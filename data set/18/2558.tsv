2010-11-21T03:35:00.000Z	intrader		Anyone, help with /whois. It does not seem to work!
2010-11-21T03:36:00.000Z	guntbert	intrader	help with using the network in #freenode
2010-11-21T03:37:00.000Z	intrader	guntbert	Ok what can I do for you?
2010-11-21T03:38:00.000Z	guntbert	intrader	you misunderstood, my sentence was to short, I wanted to tell you that you could/should ask in #freenode :-)
2010-11-21T03:38:00.000Z	intrader	guntbert	thanks
2011-03-26T02:23:00.000Z	guntbert	intrader	in synaptic I usually write linux-  into the quick search box and select "installed" from the categories on the left side
2011-03-27T02:17:00.000Z	guntbert	intrader	the worst that can happen is that you have to choose your preferred kernel once from the grub menu
2011-03-27T02:19:00.000Z	intrader	guntbert	ans what happens upon the auto-update? I think that the update has a problem with the new driver for nvidia.
2011-03-27T02:21:00.000Z	guntbert	intrader	sorry, I didn't follow your problem, generally a new kernel doesn't replace the old one bit is added to the list - so you just select the old one again
2011-03-27T02:25:00.000Z	guntbert	intrader	be confident, there will be nothing that you cannot get around from the grub menu (do you see it every time you boot?)
2011-03-27T02:27:00.000Z	guntbert	intrader	yes, I always want to see the grub menu
2011-03-27T02:27:00.000Z	intrader	guntbert	does not work with charzilla
2011-03-27T02:27:00.000Z	intrader	guntbert	chatzilla I meant
2011-03-27T02:28:00.000Z	guntbert	intrader	it certainly does, but it is no real problem either :)
2011-03-27T02:29:00.000Z	intrader	guntbert	yes it does but there must be more than one gun... Thanks
2011-03-27T02:29:00.000Z	guntbert	intrader	then press <tab> several times :-)
2011-03-27T02:30:00.000Z	intrader	guntbert	yes, thanks
2011-03-27T02:30:00.000Z	guntbert	intrader	:)
