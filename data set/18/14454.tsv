2005-07-27T11:48:00.000Z	PIANIST		a question. Am I able to connect through the Internet via ssh to a machine behind an gateway? Cause the IP adress I see is the IP of the Gateway. And if I know the IP of the Client behind the Gateway (actually i am knowing it) can I connect?
2005-07-27T11:49:00.000Z	Triffid_Hunter	PIANIST	yes.
2005-07-27T11:49:00.000Z	Triffid_Hunter	PIANIST	does the gateway have ssh? if not, you'll have to forward a port through the gateway first
2005-07-27T11:51:00.000Z	Triffid_Hunter	PIANIST	when you forward the port, you forward it to a particular ip...
2005-07-27T11:54:00.000Z	Triffid_Hunter	PIANIST	does your gateway have ssh, or are you forwarding ports?
2005-07-27T11:57:00.000Z	PIANIST	Triffid_Hunter	it has ssh. But I am NOT forwarding.... is it still possible
2005-07-27T11:57:00.000Z	Triffid_Hunter	PIANIST	man ssh. find the tunneling section. you want the -L option
2005-07-27T12:00:00.000Z	PIANIST	Triffid_Hunter	When I am not wrong it means that I connect to the gateway with the IP and port of the Client as parameter for the -L option ?
2005-07-27T12:00:00.000Z	Triffid_Hunter	PIANIST	yep
