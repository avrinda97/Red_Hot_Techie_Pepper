2006-09-25T12:55:00.000Z	chuckyp	Paddy_EIRE	thats pretty cool is that a package?
2006-09-25T12:55:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	chuckyp	yeah and it very very functional
2006-09-25T12:58:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	chuckyp	other packages for your consideration which really help productivity in ubuntu "Beagle" and "deskbar"
2006-09-25T12:59:00.000Z	chuckyp	Paddy_EIRE	familar with those just not that menu thats pretty nice.  I guess thats what gnome is trying to go to anyways
2006-09-25T13:00:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	chuckyp	yeah, although I still love the simplicity of gnome in its current state... I guess these things add great visual appeal and still remain lightweight and functional
2006-09-25T13:04:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	chuckyp	did you get the menu
2006-09-25T13:05:00.000Z	chuckyp	Paddy_EIRE	not yet i'll check it out later
2006-10-26T15:13:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	chuckyp	Im using the "k7" kernal on dapper will edgy pull down the appropriate kernal during upgrade
2006-10-26T15:26:00.000Z	chuckyp	Paddy_EIRE	no
2006-10-26T15:26:00.000Z	chuckyp	Paddy_EIRE	well no xgl
2006-10-26T15:27:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	chuckyp	although it does ship with aiglx
2006-10-26T15:27:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	chuckyp	if so is it enabled by default, I have direct rendering enabled for my ati radeon 9250 will this still be enabled after the upgrade
2006-10-26T15:28:00.000Z	chuckyp	Paddy_EIRE	you may have to reinstall what ever ati drivers you had.  Worst case scenario
2006-10-26T15:28:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	chuckyp	does not sound to bad, the default dapper drivers worked fine
