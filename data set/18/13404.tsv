2005-11-22T15:47:00.000Z	elliotf	gfish	what is your question?
2005-11-22T15:49:00.000Z	elliotf	gfish	 you can use i386 if you want..
2005-11-22T15:49:00.000Z	elliotf	gfish	 or you can use amd64
2005-11-22T15:50:00.000Z	elliotf	gfish	 what error did it give?
2005-11-22T15:50:00.000Z	elliotf	gfish	and what kind of machine?
2005-11-22T15:51:00.000Z	elliotf	gfish	 you got to 6% where?
2005-11-22T15:52:00.000Z	elliotf	gfish	 you can't use the auto-partition option?
2005-11-22T15:52:00.000Z	elliotf	gfish	 I believe it uses your entire HD for ubuntu
2005-11-22T15:53:00.000Z	elliotf	gfish	 it creates a root partition and a swap partition
2005-11-22T15:53:00.000Z	elliotf	gfish	 it will reformat, I believe
2005-11-22T15:53:00.000Z	elliotf	gfish	 do you have free space on the HD?
2005-11-22T15:55:00.000Z	elliotf	gfish	 keep it until you are sure
