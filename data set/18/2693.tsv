2010-03-16T09:07:00.000Z	has_rb		anyone here famliar with shell scripting?
2010-03-16T09:07:00.000Z	has_rb		Need to be able to extract a tar.gz and then store the extracted folder into a variable or rename the folder
2010-03-16T09:07:00.000Z	has_rb		*extracted folder name
2010-03-16T09:07:00.000Z	oliver3	has_rb	man tar
2010-03-16T09:08:00.000Z	has_rb	oliver3	I already looked there
2010-03-16T09:08:00.000Z	oliver3	has_rb	that tells you have to extract a .tar.gz file
2010-03-16T09:08:00.000Z	has_rb	oliver3	the only thing tar can do is extract to a directory
2010-03-16T09:08:00.000Z	has_rb	oliver3	i know how to extract a tar
2010-03-16T09:08:00.000Z	oliver3	has_rb	what do you want to do exactly? Rephrase your question.
2010-03-16T09:10:00.000Z	oliver3	has_rb	there is no guarantee that a tar archive will extract into a single directory. If you want that, use the -C option (but your contents will be under a further subdirectory).
2010-03-16T09:10:00.000Z	has_rb	oliver3	yeah I saw the -C option but that doesn't help really. Can I store the result of a ls | grep some and use that? or is there some other way to change the directory name dynamically
2010-03-16T09:12:00.000Z	oliver3	has_rb	a tar archive isn't guaranteed to contain a directory which contains other directories and files. It may contain a single file, many files with no directory structure etc. After the file is extracted, you'd then have to manually check the output. Unless you can write programs you're out of luck.
2010-03-16T09:13:00.000Z	oliver3	has_rb	having a single directory within a tar archive, which is named the same as the tar itself, is merely a convention, not a rule.
2010-03-16T09:14:00.000Z	has_rb	oliver3	I know, just trying to think of solutions. quite often the filename isn't the same as the directory which is why I'm trying to programatically figure it out with shell scripting
2010-03-16T09:14:00.000Z	oliver3	has_rb	bash? info bash
2010-03-16T09:15:00.000Z	has_rb	oliver3	I'm looking through to see if I find something. I think I'm just going to have the user paste in the extracted filename for now until I find a better solution
2010-03-16T09:18:00.000Z	has_rb	oliver3	hmm yeah that lists all of them so if there is a way to basically split the folders and grab the first one that would work
2010-03-16T09:19:00.000Z	oliver3	has_rb	I didn't post the --list reply sorry. :P
