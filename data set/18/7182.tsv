2009-03-02T15:27:00.000Z	maxagaz	rww	thanks
2009-08-10T13:14:00.000Z	rww	maxagaz	yes.
2009-08-10T13:14:00.000Z	maxagaz	rww	until when ?
2009-08-10T13:15:00.000Z	maxagaz	rww	is there an alternative ?
2009-08-10T13:15:00.000Z	rww	maxagaz	Unknown. packages.ubuntu.com tends to go down occasionally, it's usually back up within a few hours. What were you looking for? It might be accessible in another way.
2009-08-10T13:17:00.000Z	rww	maxagaz	Are you using Ubuntu 9.04/Jaunty?
2009-08-10T13:18:00.000Z	maxagaz	rww	yes
2009-08-10T13:19:00.000Z	rww	maxagaz	linux-source-2.6.28 is in the main repository, so it should work with the standard sources.list lines (which would look something like http://paste.ubuntu.com/250712/ )
2009-08-10T13:23:00.000Z	maxagaz	rww	thanks a lot
2009-08-10T13:43:00.000Z	maxagaz	rww	i'm looking for this package : linux-source-2.6.28-14-generic
2009-08-10T13:43:00.000Z	maxagaz	rww	but i still can't find it in your repos
2009-08-10T13:45:00.000Z	rww	maxagaz	You're probably looking for "linux-source-2.6.28". The current version in jaunty-security/main is 2.6.28-14, and the source is the same for -generic, -server, etc. (only the config is different).
2009-08-10T13:46:00.000Z	rww	maxagaz	in other words, "sudo apt-get install linux-source-2.6.28" is probably what you need to do.
2009-08-10T13:46:00.000Z	maxagaz	rww	ok, i see, thanks!
2011-05-25T07:58:00.000Z	rww	maxagaz	then install the KDE terminal and use that instead ;P
