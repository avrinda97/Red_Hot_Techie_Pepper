2010-08-23T22:55:00.000Z	computerfreaker		I just booted up my computer with that LiveCD, and the Verify CD option found no errors. Does anybody know why this is working on one computer but not another?
2010-08-23T22:56:00.000Z	computerfreaker		Does the LiveCD require a minimum amount of RAM (I'm using the 8.10 desktop version, if that makes a difference)? I'm asking because I just removed a faulty RAM module from the laptop that won't work with the LiveCD.
2010-08-23T22:58:00.000Z	Doug_Edey	computerfreaker	Have you run memtest on your RAM that's left in?
2010-08-23T23:31:00.000Z	computerfreaker	Doug_Edey	no, I can't get the RAM test to work. The LiveCD just freezes.
2010-08-23T23:33:00.000Z	Doug_Edey	computerfreaker	No USB support?
2010-08-23T23:34:00.000Z	computerfreaker	Doug_Edey	I don't think so.
2010-08-23T23:34:00.000Z	Doug_Edey	computerfreaker	hate to ask... You tried a floppy?
2010-08-23T23:35:00.000Z	computerfreaker	Doug_Edey	no, this computer doesn't have floppy support. I tried a CD.
2010-08-23T23:36:00.000Z	Doug_Edey	computerfreaker	hmmm, no idea, I'm willing to suspect that when it tries to load the CD into RAM it has issues and hence the issue
2010-08-23T23:37:00.000Z	computerfreaker	Doug_Edey	like too little RAM, perhaps? (Not sure if you saw my earlier message or not, but I just finished removing a faulty RAM module from the computer - it only has one RAM module left)
2010-08-23T23:37:00.000Z	Doug_Edey	computerfreaker	how much is in there? How do you know it was that module that was faulty and not the other?
2010-08-23T23:38:00.000Z	computerfreaker	Doug_Edey	when I tried booting into Windows, I got a BSOD due to RAM issues, then all kinds of weirdness on the screen, so I figured it had to be a RAM issue. I removed one module and tried booting up with the other and got the same issue; I replaced the second module and pulled out the first, and the system is working better now.
2010-08-23T23:40:00.000Z	Doug_Edey	computerfreaker	There could still be issues on that other module, do you have any known good?
2010-08-23T23:41:00.000Z	computerfreaker	Doug_Edey	no, I don't have any modules that are proven OK, but the total absence of BSODs & screen weirdness since I removed the one module is just about enough to convince me
2010-08-23T23:43:00.000Z	computerfreaker	Doug_Edey	not instantly. I can get to the Ubuntu menu, but as soon as I select an option everything hangs, then the system shuts down about 5 minutes later
2010-08-23T23:44:00.000Z	Doug_Edey	computerfreaker	OK, could be other issues with the HW elsewhere
2010-08-23T23:44:00.000Z	computerfreaker	Doug_Edey	wouldn't surprise me. This machine apparently has a long history of trouble.
2010-08-23T23:45:00.000Z	Doug_Edey	computerfreaker	place on floor, put C4 on top, walk away quickly, detonate C4
