2010-09-27T14:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shesaidshewas18	sounds good to me, as long as you have 2Gb RAM in the system :)
2010-09-27T14:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shesaidshewas18	sounds like a deal to me. 10Gb should be plenty for /
2010-09-27T14:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shesaidshewas18	if you are using ext3 or ext4 then that will be the journal
2010-09-27T14:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shesaidshewas18	mine's only 4Kb in size
2010-09-27T14:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shesaidshewas18	use: du -h /var/lib/ureadahead/debugfs
2010-09-27T14:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shesaidshewas18	du == disk usage  -h makes it (h)umanly readable
2010-09-27T14:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shesaidshewas18	yes you are an IT guy, but only windows right now
2010-09-27T14:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shesaidshewas18	who cares then ;)
