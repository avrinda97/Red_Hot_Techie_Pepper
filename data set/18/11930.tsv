2009-04-19T01:16:00.000Z	PROject-Emerald		Are there any ATI Radeon 9250 drivers for ubuntu other than the official ATI drivers? They're not compatible with my card

2009-04-19T01:18:00.000Z	PROject-Emerald		Are there any ATI Radeon 9250 drivers for Ubuntu 8.10? The official ATI drivers aren't compatible with this OS
2009-04-19T01:20:00.000Z	PROject-Emerald		Can anyone else vouch for this "Envyng"?
2009-04-19T01:21:00.000Z	reid	PROject-Emerald	envyng is good..  it even works for ati drivers in many cases these days
2009-04-19T01:21:00.000Z	reid	PROject-Emerald	sudo apt-get install envyng-core, move to terminal and type envyng -t
2009-04-19T01:21:00.000Z	reid	PROject-Emerald	that is literally all you do
2009-04-19T01:22:00.000Z	reid	PROject-Emerald	it will ask what drivers you want, and you tell it.  (ATI or nVidia)
2009-04-19T01:23:00.000Z	reid	PROject-Emerald	its supposed to install envyng-core
2009-04-19T01:23:00.000Z	reid	PROject-Emerald	and once that is done, type envyng -t
2009-04-23T05:10:00.000Z	reid	PROject-Emerald	whats up =P
2009-04-23T05:11:00.000Z	reid	PROject-Emerald	you shouldn't need to mount it
2009-04-23T05:11:00.000Z	reid	PROject-Emerald	just double click the iso file, and it should prompt you for what you want to do with it
2009-04-23T05:11:00.000Z	reid	PROject-Emerald	one of those options are burn to CD/DVD
2009-04-23T05:12:00.000Z	reid	PROject-Emerald	if it says "burn image to CD/DVD", then if the .iso is of a bootable CD, then it will be bootable
2009-04-23T05:14:00.000Z	reid	PROject-Emerald	just do it through the write to disk menu
2009-04-23T05:14:00.000Z	reid	PROject-Emerald	burn to CD writer
2009-04-23T05:18:00.000Z	reid	PROject-Emerald	yeah it should be fine
