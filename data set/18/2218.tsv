2010-07-21T23:04:00.000Z	metalgeek		Hi, I have a 40gb ATA Hard drive, and a 500gb SATA drive. How would you suggest that i set up my system to take best advantage of this under Ubuntu?

2010-07-21T23:07:00.000Z	abhijit	metalgeek	its upto your personal choise. I could have installed ubuntu on whole 500gb and kept that 40gb for extrathigns
2010-07-21T23:09:00.000Z	metalgeek	abhijit	I get that i could choose, but is there a logical reason to do it a certain was?
2010-07-21T23:10:00.000Z	abhijit	metalgeek	no logical reason. its just its easy to maintain.
2010-07-21T23:14:00.000Z	abhijit	metalgeek	look for the size of /tmp. sometimes it needs large space and it dont have. so keep /tmp in larger one partition

2010-07-26T21:20:00.000Z	abhijit	metalgeek	64 bit is recommended
2010-07-26T21:21:00.000Z	metalgeek	abhijit	That page you sent me to seems to think otherwise, are you sure 64
2010-07-26T21:21:00.000Z	abhijit	metalgeek	64 bit recommended
2010-07-26T21:22:00.000Z	abhijit	metalgeek	that page reads as: What should I choose - 32 or 64 bit?
2010-07-26T21:23:00.000Z	metalgeek	abhijit	I'm such an idiot (Unless you have specific reasons to choose 32-bit, we recommend 64-bit. )
2010-07-26T21:23:00.000Z	metalgeek	abhijit	Sorry
2010-07-26T21:23:00.000Z	abhijit	metalgeek	:)
2010-07-26T21:23:00.000Z	abhijit	metalgeek	go for 64 bit
2010-07-26T21:24:00.000Z	abhijit	metalgeek	learning? what you want to learn?
2010-07-26T21:25:00.000Z	abhijit	metalgeek	visit linux.com and some good linux forums
