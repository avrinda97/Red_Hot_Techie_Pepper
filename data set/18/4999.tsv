2009-03-17T20:29:00.000Z	danes_		how can I change directory on terminal for a network place? it is mounted on smb://<mynetwork>
2009-03-17T20:31:00.000Z	LjL	danes_	it can't be "mounted" to smb://anything, because that's not a mountpoint
2009-03-17T20:32:00.000Z	danes_	LjL	is there any way I can access the files of my network hdd using terminal?
2009-03-17T20:32:00.000Z	LjL	danes_	yes, but you have to actually mount it. the link i gave you should have instructions for that. anyway short version, "sudo mount //servername/sharename /mnt/whatever -o username=blah"
2009-03-17T20:33:00.000Z	danes_	LjL	thanks
2009-04-19T19:55:00.000Z	LjL	danes_	depends what you mean by "damaging your system". besides, why would you want to do that?
2009-04-19T19:56:00.000Z	danes_	LjL	the problem is that I need to update my system and when I did "df" whis is what I got http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/154108/
2009-04-19T19:57:00.000Z	LjL	danes_	/tmp is only full because your main drive is full to begin with.
2009-04-19T19:57:00.000Z	danes_	LjL	it shows me that I have 3gb of free space. I dont get it
2009-04-19T19:58:00.000Z	LjL	danes_	... no, it doesn't?
2009-04-19T19:58:00.000Z	LjL	danes_	you have 3gb on home
2009-04-19T19:58:00.000Z	LjL	danes_	you have a 10gb root partition, and it's full
2009-04-19T19:58:00.000Z	danes_	LjL	ohh  upsss
2009-04-19T19:58:00.000Z	danes_	LjL	thanks
2009-04-19T19:58:00.000Z	LjL	danes_	try "sudo apt-get clean"
2009-04-19T19:59:00.000Z	danes_	LjL	thanks :), now, how can I get rid of the last few kernel images?
2009-04-19T19:59:00.000Z	LjL	danes_	like with any other package.
