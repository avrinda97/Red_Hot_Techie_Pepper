2008-07-31T03:31:00.000Z	Dominik1	ubuntu_live	hey
2008-07-31T03:32:00.000Z	Dominik1	ubuntu_live	can you resend me the two links ? :D
2008-07-31T03:32:00.000Z	ubuntu_live	Dominik1	sure one sec
2008-07-31T03:32:00.000Z	ubuntu_live	Dominik1	first the appdb entry http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&iId=3000
2008-07-31T03:33:00.000Z	ubuntu_live	Dominik1	then here's the install instructions http://www.winehq.org/site/download-deb
2008-07-31T03:35:00.000Z	Dominik1	ubuntu_live	ok thx let me try and nupdate wine
2008-07-31T03:46:00.000Z	Dominik1	ubuntu_live	could it be that I still have to install Direct X 8.0 ? Or does Wine come with a current Diret
2008-07-31T03:47:00.000Z	ubuntu_live	Dominik1	no it actually comes with its own version (that converts the direct x to the underlying linux systems)  so no one has a similar problem to you on appdb?
2008-07-31T03:50:00.000Z	Dominik1	ubuntu_live	well I changed something let me try and see if the problem is still there
2008-07-31T03:50:00.000Z	ubuntu_live	Dominik1	good luck
2008-07-31T03:51:00.000Z	Dominik1	ubuntu_live	it crashes with "Gothic caused an access violation by attempting to read from Adress 000000000h "
2008-07-31T03:52:00.000Z	ubuntu_live	Dominik1	OH! do you have compiz enabled right now? because wine and compiz don't get along...
2008-07-31T03:52:00.000Z	Dominik1	ubuntu_live	aha yes I do
2008-07-31T03:52:00.000Z	ubuntu_live	Dominik1	no guarantees that will fix it, but it's a start
2008-07-31T03:56:00.000Z	Dominik1	ubuntu_live	hmm do I have to restart after deactivating Compiz, cuz now It just stops responding after starting the game (doesn't seem to crash the same way as before)
2008-07-31T04:06:00.000Z	Dominik1	ubuntu_live	hmm the game opens a new window, but that window just stays white and then there is some weird graphic glitch in the center (a bunch of squares) and then It says that it isn't responding and I can either wait or force quit :-/
2008-07-31T04:07:00.000Z	ubuntu_live	Dominik1	:-/ sorry dude, well that's about the extent of my knowledge, appdb and #winehq are the only things i can really do for you now, sorry
2008-07-31T04:08:00.000Z	Dominik1	ubuntu_live	ok thx 4 the help
