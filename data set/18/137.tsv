2012-08-12T03:20:00.000Z	VlanX		sorry guys, but how is it possible that i can never report the correct quantity of used RAM that i have?
2012-08-12T03:21:00.000Z	bekks	VlanX	The only possibility is, that you do not know about the existence of the "free -m" command.
2012-08-12T03:22:00.000Z	VlanX	bekks	how bout that?  Mem:         15959      15769        189
2012-08-12T03:23:00.000Z	bekks	VlanX	The complete output in a pastebin is important.
2012-08-12T03:24:00.000Z	bekks	VlanX	You are - technically. RAM not used by applications will be used for caching, which is good, very goog.
2012-08-12T03:26:00.000Z	bekks	VlanX	Assigned memory does not equal used memory in terms of virtualization.
2012-08-12T03:27:00.000Z	bekks	VlanX	You are wrong.
2012-11-11T23:38:00.000Z	bekks	VlanX	Why? Isnt a SSD designed to write things, too?
2012-11-11T23:39:00.000Z	bekks	VlanX	If so, mount the FS read-only...
2012-11-11T23:39:00.000Z	VlanX	bekks	two hours of continuous SSD wirtes @ 20mbps? have fun with that
2012-11-11T23:39:00.000Z	bekks	VlanX	Works for years here, currently.
2012-11-11T23:39:00.000Z	bekks	VlanX	I have much more constant writes here, when doing things.
2012-11-11T23:40:00.000Z	VlanX	bekks	 well, pardon me but i would prefer not having useless ssd activity going on in the background
2012-11-11T23:40:00.000Z	bekks	VlanX	My activity is usefull... like deploying VMs massively, etc.
2012-11-11T23:41:00.000Z	bekks	VlanX	So whats causing your I/O then?
2012-11-11T23:42:00.000Z	bekks	VlanX	Tried using a fresh user or using another desktop environment?
2012-11-11T23:45:00.000Z	bekks	VlanX	So it didnt happen for hours now, correct?
2012-11-11T23:45:00.000Z	VlanX	bekks	it did because i noticed the red led of hdd activity some hours ago, but didn't bother looking what it was
