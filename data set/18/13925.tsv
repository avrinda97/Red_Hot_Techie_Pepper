2006-01-19T06:37:00.000Z	theine	KasperTech	aren't 2000 fps quite a lot actually?
2006-01-19T06:38:00.000Z	KasperTech	theine	Well I thought so, but then it might not be "fps"... see the average is 6k.
2006-01-19T06:39:00.000Z	theine	KasperTech	where is it stated what the average is?
2006-01-19T06:39:00.000Z	theine	KasperTech	not that I don't want to believe you, but I'd be interested to find out...
2006-01-19T06:39:00.000Z	KasperTech	theine	In the readme of glxgears and on the ubuntuforums, where people pastes their achievements.
2006-01-19T06:39:00.000Z	KasperTech	theine	:)
2006-01-19T06:39:00.000Z	theine	KasperTech	ah, ok
2006-01-19T06:40:00.000Z	theine	KasperTech	that's *a lot* more that I get...
2006-01-19T06:40:00.000Z	KasperTech	theine	What do you get?
2006-01-19T06:41:00.000Z	theine	KasperTech	I did hear somewhere that glxgears isn't actually a very good benchmark though
2006-01-19T06:41:00.000Z	theine	KasperTech	let me check
2006-01-19T06:41:00.000Z	KasperTech	theine	Okay.
2006-01-19T06:43:00.000Z	theine	KasperTech	hmmm, glxgears doesn't produce any terminal output here so I can't figure out how many fps I get...
2006-01-19T06:43:00.000Z	KasperTech	theine	Ye, my prob. exactly. :)
2006-01-19T06:43:00.000Z	theine	KasperTech	are you running Dapper?
2006-01-19T06:43:00.000Z	KasperTech	theine	No, what's that?
2006-01-19T06:44:00.000Z	theine	KasperTech	Ubuntu development version
2006-01-19T06:44:00.000Z	KasperTech	theine	Oh, no... I'm running Breezy stable.
