2007-07-06T12:53:00.000Z	dilligafftw		I'm trying to install xubuntu on to an old IBM Aptiva 2170.The disc loads fine and I can see the first screen with all the menu options but when I try to install the system reboots and won't install. it's driving me crazy. Any help is greatly appreciated.
2007-07-06T12:54:00.000Z	FakeOutdoorsman	dilligafftw	are you using the alternate install disc?
2007-07-06T12:54:00.000Z	dilligafftw		FO yes I'm using the laternative disc
2007-07-06T12:55:00.000Z	FakeOutdoorsman	dilligafftw	did you check the integrity of the disc?
2007-07-06T12:56:00.000Z	dilligafftw		FO: from the menu list - check cd for defects?
2007-07-06T12:57:00.000Z	FakeOutdoorsman	dilligafftw	yes
2007-07-06T12:57:00.000Z	dilligafftw		FO: computer reboots on that option too
2007-07-06T12:57:00.000Z	dilligafftw		FO: when I burnt the cd I did verify the data
2007-07-06T12:57:00.000Z	FakeOutdoorsman	dilligafftw	how much ram does the laptop have?
2007-07-06T12:58:00.000Z	dilligafftw		FO: 256 M
2007-07-06T12:59:00.000Z	FakeOutdoorsman	dilligafftw	that should work.  ive installed on 128...  i don't know why yours is rebooting.
2007-07-06T13:00:00.000Z	dilligafftw		FO: I tried adding the commmand expert acpi=off but that didn't work. Don't know if I added it properly or in the right place
2007-07-06T13:03:00.000Z	dilligafftw	FakeOutdoorsman	tried this fix https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-source-2.6.15/+bug/17667
2007-07-06T13:05:00.000Z	FakeOutdoorsman	dilligafftw	looks like you're on the right track.  try booting with the noacpi option instead of acpi=off
2007-07-06T13:06:00.000Z	dilligafftw	FakeOutdoorsman	ok what do I type instead - noacpi?
2007-07-06T13:07:00.000Z	FakeOutdoorsman	dilligafftw	heh...nevermind my last comment...i confused myself
2007-07-06T13:07:00.000Z	dilligafftw	FakeOutdoorsman	no problem
2007-07-06T13:07:00.000Z	FakeOutdoorsman	dilligafftw	i was looking over my old install and mixed up "noapic" with acpi
