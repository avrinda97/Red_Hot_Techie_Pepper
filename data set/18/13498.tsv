2006-12-13T12:40:00.000Z	derekS		i am upgrading from dapper->edgy. i only have packages from the official ubuntu archives. i did it via apt-get dist-upgrade. it is saying how "courier-authdaemon" is in a bad inconsistent state. i have tried -f upgrade, reconfiguring, reinstalling, etc
2006-12-13T12:40:00.000Z	derekS		nothing is working
2006-12-13T12:40:00.000Z	derekS		what should i do
2006-12-13T10:33:00.000Z	derekS		i foobared my system when upgrading from dapper->edgy. I changed the sources and did an apt-get dist-upgrade... after i foobared it i saw the upgrade help site (on help.ubuntu.com)... is it too late to fix it?
2006-12-13T10:33:00.000Z	derekS		i have no nonofficial packages
2006-12-13T10:33:00.000Z	derekS		all my packages come from the repo

2006-12-13T10:36:00.000Z	LjL	derekS	that's a known bug i believe, let me dig it
2006-12-13T10:36:00.000Z	derekS	LjL	really? fixable?
2006-12-13T10:36:00.000Z	LjL	derekS	not fixed yet, but i don't know if it can be fixed manually, reading the reports
2006-12-13T10:37:00.000Z	derekS	LjL	oh ok
2006-12-13T10:38:00.000Z	LjL	derekS	well, there are some people who claimed they could fix it manually

2006-12-13T10:40:00.000Z	LjL	derekS	look at the suggestion in the last comment, and perhaps also the suggestion in the comment that starts "ok, here is how i fixed it"
2006-12-13T10:59:00.000Z	derekS	LjL	thanks for the courier-authdaemon bug pages... i am looking now, (sorry my boss called me in)
