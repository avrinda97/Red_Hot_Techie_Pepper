2011-01-18T06:27:00.000Z	tdebaets		my ubuntu system doesnt recognize the : command in shell scripts that are run under sudo anymore
2011-01-18T06:28:00.000Z	tdebaets		this results in errors when updating packages, and when suspending/hibernating
2011-01-18T06:28:00.000Z	tdebaets		any ideas?
2011-01-18T06:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tdebaets	how do you mean? If you need admin access in a script, just add sudo in the script then run the whole script with sudo
2011-01-18T06:29:00.000Z	tdebaets	ActionParsnip	hang on, ill post the commands that show the problem

2011-01-18T06:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tdebaets	i'd ask in #bash too, I've not heard of this : notation
2011-01-18T06:32:00.000Z	tdebaets	ActionParsnip	will do
2011-01-18T06:37:00.000Z	tdebaets	ActionParsnip	in #bash, they redirect me back to here
2011-01-18T06:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tdebaets	well thats messed up, you are using bash scripts...
2011-01-18T06:37:00.000Z	tdebaets	ActionParsnip	i am?
2011-01-18T06:38:00.000Z	tdebaets	ActionParsnip	its the scripts used by ubuntu...
2011-01-18T06:38:00.000Z	tdebaets	ActionParsnip	[02:37] <e36freak> you need to fix your bash installation or permissions, but that's OS specific
2011-01-18T06:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tdebaets	sounds like it to me
2011-01-18T06:40:00.000Z	tdebaets	ActionParsnip	any idea how to fix the bash installation or permissions?
2011-01-18T06:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tdebaets	not sure man, i've never seen this : thing you mention although my bash knowledge is limited to little scripts for an easy life
2011-01-18T07:05:00.000Z	tdebaets	ActionParsnip	Pici: reinstalling dash seems to have fixed it
2011-01-18T07:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	tdebaets	sweet, glad you got the gold :)
