2008-05-11T23:55:00.000Z	RyanPrior	busta5000	You have been told the answer multiple times. If you are not going to read our answers, we will not help you any more,.
2008-05-12T00:01:00.000Z	RyanPrior	busta5000	http://mirrors.kernel.org/ubuntu/pool/main/n/ndisgtk/ndisgtk_0.8.3-1_i386.deb
2008-05-12T00:01:00.000Z	RyanPrior	busta5000	There's a direct download link for the debian installer file.
2008-05-12T00:02:00.000Z	RyanPrior	busta5000	Not needed. Just double-click the .deb file and it'll open up an installer app.
2008-05-12T00:03:00.000Z	RyanPrior	busta5000	Don't try to open it as a text file. Save it as a binary file.
2008-05-12T00:07:00.000Z	RyanPrior	busta5000	Another link? The one I gave before works fine for me.
2008-05-12T00:08:00.000Z	RyanPrior	busta5000	If that one isn't working for some odd reason, try http://ubuntu.mirrors.tds.net/ubuntu/pool/main/n/ndisgtk/ndisgtk_0.8.3-1_i386.deb
2008-05-12T00:10:00.000Z	RyanPrior	busta5000	You need to copy it over to your Ubuntu box and then double-click it.
