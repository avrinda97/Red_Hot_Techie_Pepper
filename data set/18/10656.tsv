2009-02-26T04:05:00.000Z	Crooper		hello everybody :) .... how can i set up virtual name based hosting with dhcp and wireless?
2009-02-26T04:06:00.000Z	Crooper		websites
2009-02-26T04:07:00.000Z	Crooper		i develop sites on my laptop and would like the customer to view the site ahead of time while i'm on the phone with them
2009-02-26T04:08:00.000Z	Crooper		i have lamp server set up and a registered name but i connect to the Internet thru dhcp
2009-02-26T04:09:00.000Z	Crooper		i use dynamic service too but i can't assign my nic a ip address
2009-02-26T04:09:00.000Z	Crooper		cuse it  isn't my isp service.... it's public
2009-02-26T04:11:00.000Z	Crooper		yes CarlFK  but i wouldn't be on the phone with the customer if i had them where they could see when i did http://localhost
2009-02-26T04:13:00.000Z	Crooper		i live on a boat... unfortunately having a home network is impossible for me right now
2009-02-26T04:14:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Crooper	You could send the site ( especially if it's static ) to someone who does have a publicly accessible server, or the customer ( though I am guessing they wouldn't know what to do with it )
2009-02-26T04:17:00.000Z	Crooper	Jordan_U	 i have a server set up at my mom's but didn't want to develop, transfer, develop, transfer...etc.
2009-02-26T04:18:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Crooper	You could foreward traffic from your mom'
2009-02-26T04:18:00.000Z	Crooper	Jordan_U	it's already forwarded
2009-02-26T04:19:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Crooper	... From your mom's server to yours over ssh ( a session initiated on your end ) but it would probably not be worth the trouble
2009-02-26T04:20:00.000Z	Crooper	Jordan_U	 thnx but that is already set up
2009-02-26T04:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Crooper	If that is already setup then why can't the customer access your server through the one at your mom's ?
2009-02-26T04:22:00.000Z	Crooper	Jordan_U	 I was trying to shorten the process for the customer
2009-02-26T04:24:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Crooper	I am not sure that you understand what I mean, ssh has some fancy tricks and you can foreward packets from port 80 on the server at your mom's over an ssh tunnel to your machine, even without having a publicly accessible ip on your machine.
