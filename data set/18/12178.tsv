2006-05-19T10:34:00.000Z	Old		Im not a pro at ubuntu at all, Kinda new to it. It'd be great if I'd get the intel xeon's to work togheter.
2006-05-19T10:35:00.000Z	Old		I'd be sooooooo greatful if i can get it to work without having to reinstall everything
2006-05-19T10:35:00.000Z	Old		No, just 2 plain intel xeon 3.0's 64bits
2006-05-19T10:35:00.000Z	slackern	Old	i belive you need to install a 686 kernel i belive, that has smp enabled.
2006-05-19T10:36:00.000Z	slackern	Old	'sudo apt-get install linux-image-686-smp'  should do it i belive
2006-05-19T10:37:00.000Z	slackern	Old	yes, it will give you one more kernel at bootup to choose from.
2006-05-19T10:38:00.000Z	slackern	Old	i belive it will be the default in grub after you install it.
2006-05-19T10:40:00.000Z	slackern	Old	it doesn't matter.
2006-05-19T10:47:00.000Z	Old	slackern	I dont understand a jack-shit on that "top" thing tbh.
2006-05-27T07:10:00.000Z	slackern	Old	'pgrep speedlink' will show what pids match speedlink
2006-05-27T07:11:00.000Z	slackern	Old	'pkill speedlink' should kill them all im not so used to it but i belive it will.
