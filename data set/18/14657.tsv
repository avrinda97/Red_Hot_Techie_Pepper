2005-12-09T06:58:00.000Z	doktoreas		it's not an ahrdware issue cause with anoter live distro the wired works
2005-12-09T06:59:00.000Z	dabaR	doktoreas	what does that have to do with your wireless card. Dont clutter your questtion like that. Can you rephrase what you would like?
2005-12-09T07:02:00.000Z	doktoreas	dabaR	both wired and wirelss are recognized, but the wired one can only ping itself and not the pc on the lan
2005-12-09T07:03:00.000Z	dabaR	doktoreas	do you need us to help you with the wired, or wireless?
2005-12-09T07:03:00.000Z	doktoreas	dabaR	wired one
2005-12-09T07:04:00.000Z	dabaR	doktoreas	OK, so, what does the LAN work on? a router?
2005-12-09T07:06:00.000Z	dabaR	doktoreas	that is the router IP address? do you have the ubuntu computer beside you? type ifconfig and tell us the IP address you have tghere.
2005-12-09T07:09:00.000Z	dabaR	doktoreas	can you ping the router?
2005-12-09T07:10:00.000Z	doktoreas	dabaR	nope :(
2005-12-09T07:10:00.000Z	doktoreas	dabaR	i can only ping myself
2005-12-09T07:10:00.000Z	dabaR	doktoreas	and you can not ping google, and you can not browse the web?
2005-12-09T07:12:00.000Z	doktoreas	dabaR	i can't ping the router so interent is not working
2005-12-09T07:14:00.000Z	dabaR	doktoreas	maybe you turned off pinging on your router... Anyhow, you have a proper IP address, I do not see why you would not be able to surf. post your /etc/network/interfaces file to paste.ubuntulinux.nl
2005-12-09T07:24:00.000Z	doktoreas	dabaR	i can ping the router from other pc... this is the paste
2005-12-09T07:24:00.000Z	dabaR	doktoreas	why a static IP addresss? use dhcp for your router.
2005-12-09T07:26:00.000Z	doktoreas	dabaR	i wanna use staic ip address
2005-12-09T07:26:00.000Z	dabaR	doktoreas	then set it up at the router, not at the computer.
2005-12-09T07:30:00.000Z	dabaR	doktoreas	do you think you know how to set up the static Ip at the router? if not, read its manual, I bet its available online.
