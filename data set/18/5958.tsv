2008-07-28T05:49:00.000Z	xttocs		How can I flash a terminal window on the task bar?
2008-07-28T05:50:00.000Z	xttocs		I want to programatically be able to alter myself by flashing the window, like windows does all the time even when it doesn't need to
2008-07-28T05:50:00.000Z	xttocs		err
2008-07-28T05:50:00.000Z	xttocs		programatically flash the window to *alert* myself
2008-07-28T05:51:00.000Z	TiredWolf	xttocs	possibly echo -e "\a"
2008-07-28T05:51:00.000Z	xttocs	TiredWolf	That just beeped
2008-07-28T05:51:00.000Z	TiredWolf	xttocs	yeah, i thought it'd possibly also flash the window, at least if it's in the background
2008-07-28T05:52:00.000Z	xttocs	TiredWolf	I'm asking because I have IRSSI running and I want to be able to flash the window when I get new messages
2008-07-28T05:54:00.000Z	TiredWolf	xttocs	i believe the only possible way to achieve it is a bell, which is what i made you try. see in your terminal emulator's settings if there is a way to turn the audible bell into a visible flashing. if you can do that, then you can most likely also configure irssi to do it.
2008-07-28T05:54:00.000Z	TiredWolf	xttocs	some people also have irssi scripts to get a pop-up balloon, or things like that, but i really don't know the details of that.
2008-07-28T05:54:00.000Z	xttocs	TiredWolf	I've seen those scripts, and I was going to modify one if I figured out how to flash the window
2008-07-28T05:55:00.000Z	xttocs	TiredWolf	I'll give what you suggested a shot, though.  Thanks
2008-07-28T05:56:00.000Z	TiredWolf	xttocs	see, for instance this is the instructions to do exactly what i described with Putty, but obviously you aren't using Putty as terminal: http://blog.ryara.net/2007/06/29/flashing-taskbar-with-putty-irssi-screen/
2008-07-28T05:57:00.000Z	xttocs	TiredWolf	yep, that's what I need
2008-07-28T05:59:00.000Z	TiredWolf	xttocs	no cigar, but http://osdir.com/ml/org.user-groups.linux.new-zealand.general/2003-12/msg00046.html
2008-07-28T06:01:00.000Z	TiredWolf	xttocs	even less of a cigar, but at least this makes it clear it's pretty hard to achieve with gnome-terminal - http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-415172.html
2008-07-28T06:10:00.000Z	TiredWolf	xttocs	well i think you can just just about everything with echo -e, where \E is the escape character, and \xNNN can be an (hexadecimal) ascii character
2008-07-28T06:11:00.000Z	xttocs	TiredWolf	thanks again
