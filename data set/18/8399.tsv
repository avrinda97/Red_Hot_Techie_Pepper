2008-07-11T11:05:00.000Z	madrazr		s/sucurity/security
2008-07-11T11:07:00.000Z	Flannel	madrazr	/etc/pam.d/common-passwd
2008-07-11T11:07:00.000Z	madrazr	Flannel	i will try just a moment
2008-07-15T09:46:00.000Z	Flannel	madrazr	What options did you give it in your fstab?
2008-07-15T09:46:00.000Z	madrazr	Flannel	/dev/data/mach  /media/mach   ext3  defaults 0        1
2008-07-15T09:47:00.000Z	madrazr	Flannel	I have one more volume group which I had created very long back, for that also I have given the same options
2008-07-15T09:47:00.000Z	madrazr	Flannel	but its working fine, but its a 30 GiB one
2008-07-15T09:47:00.000Z	Flannel	madrazr	defaults is fine, yes.  What are the permissions on the mountpoint youre mounting to?
2008-07-15T09:48:00.000Z	madrazr	Flannel	Oh! wait let me see
2008-07-15T09:49:00.000Z	madrazr	Flannel	drwxr-xr-x  4 root root 4096 2008-07-15 02:19 mach
2008-07-15T09:49:00.000Z	madrazr	Flannel	should it be rwx for user also?
2008-07-15T09:49:00.000Z	Flannel	madrazr	No, that looks right.
2008-07-15T09:50:00.000Z	madrazr	Flannel	but I said I have other volume right? mount point for that has drwxrwxrwx 19 root root 4096 2008-07-12 02:33 professional
2008-07-15T09:51:00.000Z	madrazr	Flannel	any idea?
2008-07-15T09:53:00.000Z	Flannel	madrazr	No.  You could try +w-ing the mountpoint.  Just don't do it recursively
2008-07-15T09:53:00.000Z	madrazr	Flannel	Ok fine let me try
