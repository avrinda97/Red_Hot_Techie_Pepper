2008-01-19T12:38:00.000Z	Hazarath		Okes, hello. Got a 2.0 USB SATA drive acting like it's at 1.1 speed, but, no idea: how to see if it is, or correct it.
2008-01-19T12:38:00.000Z	tumbleweed__	Hazarath	: the drive itself is probably just slow
2008-01-19T12:39:00.000Z	tumbleweed__		yes
2008-01-19T12:39:00.000Z	tumbleweed__		yup
2008-01-19T12:39:00.000Z	tumbleweed__		or compiz-fusion
2008-01-19T12:39:00.000Z	tumbleweed__		as the case may be
2008-01-19T12:39:00.000Z	Hazarath	tumbleweed__	under Windows, it worked at 2.0 speeds, and it also told me, under windows, when connected to a 1.1 hub, it said 'This device can run faster when connected to a 2.0 USB hub. Click here...'
2008-01-19T12:39:00.000Z	tumbleweed__		oh
2008-01-19T12:40:00.000Z	tumbleweed__	Hazarath	: so is it connected to a usb 2.0 hub or not?
2008-01-19T12:40:00.000Z	Hazarath	tumbleweed__	yes, and it's also regerstering under device manager as such.
2008-01-19T12:41:00.000Z	tumbleweed__		then it is operating at usb 2.0 speed
2008-01-19T12:41:00.000Z	tumbleweed__		the problem is probably a slow drive, or power saving configs
2008-01-19T12:44:00.000Z	tumbleweed__		LOL

2008-01-19T12:45:00.000Z	tumbleweed__		fair enough
