2005-02-10T07:04:00.000Z	ycco	cafuego	you know how to make fonts?
2005-02-10T07:05:00.000Z	ycco	cafuego	like ttf version?
2005-02-10T07:05:00.000Z	cafuego	ycco	Yeah. On Windows or MacOS, anyway.
2005-02-10T07:05:00.000Z	cafuego	ycco	TTF or Postscript.
2005-02-10T07:05:00.000Z	ycco	cafuego	I'd be willing to give feedback on it while you work on it.  (as a sounding board)
2005-02-10T07:05:00.000Z	cafuego	ycco	You use a font creation application. Simply draw paths, export as font, done.
2005-02-10T07:06:00.000Z	ycco	cafuego	and help you with ideas here and there with letter suggestions.
2005-02-10T07:06:00.000Z	cafuego	ycco	You're assuming I'm going to donate time to actually create a font <heh>
2005-02-10T07:06:00.000Z	ycco	cafuego	occy@occy.net  (i'm normally logged on as occy fwiw:   occy.net  )
2005-02-10T07:07:00.000Z	ycco	cafuego	hah, yes, indeed, I did make that assumption. :)
2005-02-10T07:07:00.000Z	cafuego	ycco	It's not *hard* to do it, it's *time consuming*
2005-02-10T07:08:00.000Z	ycco	cafuego	well, You've got my info for help and input should you choose to do it. :)
2005-02-10T07:08:00.000Z	ycco	cafuego	two heads are better than one on any project IMHO.
2005-02-10T07:08:00.000Z	cafuego	ycco	that depends on the project <heh>
2005-02-10T07:09:00.000Z	ycco	cafuego	I guess we'd also have to get approval from jdub (and the Ubuntu people) before it would be allowed to be distro'ed with Ubuntu.
2005-02-10T07:09:00.000Z	cafuego	ycco	I see no (r) or [tm]  anywhere
2005-02-10T07:09:00.000Z	ycco	cafuego	You the release manager for Ubuntu?
2005-02-10T07:09:00.000Z	ycco	cafuego	Don't think it's getting in otherwise.
