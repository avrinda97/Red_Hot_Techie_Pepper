2009-11-10T15:46:00.000Z	boomer84		seems to me people only like answering the complex questions so those of us trying to learn kinda get frozen out
2009-11-10T15:47:00.000Z	erUSUL	boomer84	i've never used ubuntu one so i dunno a wit about it. but if you got meessed up with versions is becouse you upgraded the provided client by hand instead of using the one in the repositories
2009-11-10T15:47:00.000Z	boomer84	erUSUL	thanks for that but you are wrong. I use the repositories for updates.
2009-11-10T15:48:00.000Z	erUSUL	boomer84	so; there is aclear bug ? have you reported it (or maybe is already known)?
2009-11-10T15:48:00.000Z	erUSUL	boomer84	then you can try to force the install of an lder version...
2009-11-10T15:50:00.000Z	erUSUL	boomer84	sudo aptitude install ubuntu-one-client-package=knowngoodversion
2009-11-10T16:04:00.000Z	boomer84	erUSUL	Cheers for the help. it still isnt working but I am getting closer I think. Will keep on trying.
2009-11-10T16:04:00.000Z	erUSUL	boomer84	no problem
2009-11-12T15:02:00.000Z	erUSUL	boomer84	locally you mean on your lan only on on your machine only ?
2009-11-12T15:03:00.000Z	boomer84	erUSUL	locally on my machine only. I am on a laptop always using different wireless connections for access so security is in flux
2009-11-12T15:03:00.000Z	erUSUL	boomer84	then there should be a conf option for the web server to listen only in lo:127.0.0.1 (localhost)
2009-11-12T15:09:00.000Z	boomer84	erUSUL	 It is the Apache config file I need to edit right?
2009-11-12T15:10:00.000Z	erUSUL	boomer84	probably yes something like Listen = 127.0.0.1 or something to that effect (apache conf is xml ...)
2009-11-12T15:10:00.000Z	erUSUL	boomer84	http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/bind.html
2009-11-12T15:11:00.000Z	boomer84	erUSUL	I am being really idiotic trying to find the file. Dont help, I need to know how to find this stuff myself
2009-11-12T15:11:00.000Z	erUSUL	boomer84	well debian/ubuntu likes to chop conf files in many tiny files under .d directories ;P
2009-11-12T15:12:00.000Z	erUSUL	boomer84	so grep -R is your friend ;)
2009-11-12T15:13:00.000Z	erUSUL	boomer84	grep -R 'Listen' /etc/apache/
