2006-07-01T11:01:00.000Z	kristian	bderrly	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/CommandLine, why don't " /etc/apt...." work?
2006-07-01T11:01:00.000Z	bderrly	kristian	you need to give it a command to view it, like 'less'
2006-07-01T11:02:00.000Z	bderrly	kristian	you can't just type in the file name
2006-07-01T11:05:00.000Z	kristian	bderrly	you know how to update my kernel?
2006-07-01T11:06:00.000Z	bderrly	kristian	what cpu do you have?
2006-07-01T11:07:00.000Z	bderrly	kristian	sudo apt-get install linux-kernel-k7
2006-07-01T11:08:00.000Z	bderrly	kristian	linux-image-k7, sorry
2006-07-01T11:10:00.000Z	bderrly	kristian	in your irc client type this:  /exec -o uname -r
2006-07-01T11:11:00.000Z	bderrly	kristian	/exec
2006-07-01T11:12:00.000Z	bderrly	kristian	on the command line type: uname -r and paste it here
2006-07-01T11:13:00.000Z	bderrly	kristian	what irc client are you using?
2006-07-01T11:13:00.000Z	bderrly	kristian	i did a ctcp to get your irc client but it didn't respond
2006-07-01T11:14:00.000Z	kristian	bderrly	ok :P
2006-07-01T11:16:00.000Z	kristian	bderrly	as jamesstansell said earlier, he thought it was a little strange that when I do" apt-cache search kernel-headers " i only find old versions. (all 2.4) Do you know how i can fix that?
2006-07-01T11:17:00.000Z	bderrly	kristian	are you running dapper or breezy?
