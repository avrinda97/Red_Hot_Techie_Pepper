2012-05-30T07:44:00.000Z	ms-daisy		Hi, I'm trying to make a copy of a .conf file before I mess with it on my server.  I'm using this command: sudo cp /etc/apt/apt.conf /etc/apt/apt.conf.original sudo chmod a-w /etc/apt/apt.conf.original.
2012-05-30T07:45:00.000Z	ms-daisy		I get the error: target '/etc/apt/apt.conf.original' is not a directory.  What am I doing wrong?
2012-05-30T07:45:00.000Z	nydel	ms-daisy	is /etc/apt/apt.conf a directory?
2012-05-30T07:46:00.000Z	nydel	ms-daisy	do this: cd /etc/apt/apt.conf;sudo cp apt.conf apt.conf.original
2012-05-30T07:47:00.000Z	nydel	ms-daisy	i meant this: cd /etc/apt;sudo cp apt.conf apt.conf.original
2012-05-30T07:50:00.000Z	nydel	ms-daisy	same error?
2012-05-30T07:51:00.000Z	nydel	ms-daisy	try this: cp /etc/apt/apt.conf ~/apt.conf.original
2012-05-30T07:51:00.000Z	nydel	ms-daisy	that should put a copy of the original in your home directory
2012-05-30T07:51:00.000Z	nydel	ms-daisy	that's why we love computers -- when they mess up, it's our fault :)
2012-05-30T07:54:00.000Z	nydel	ms-daisy	there's no real topic on saving conf files -- you need to know about "linux file permissions" & the "cp" command.
2012-05-30T07:54:00.000Z	nydel	ms-daisy	9 times of 10, a .conf is textual
2012-05-30T07:58:00.000Z	nydel	ms-daisy	do this: "sudo vi /etc/apt/apt.conf.d" then type ":w /etc/apt/apt.conf.d" then type ":q"
2012-05-30T07:58:00.000Z	nydel	ms-daisy	do this: "sudo vi /etc/apt/apt.conf.d" then type ":w /etc/apt/apt.conf.d.original" then type ":q"
2012-05-30T07:59:00.000Z	nydel	ms-daisy	it might not be a file
2012-05-30T08:00:00.000Z	nydel	ms-daisy	try "sudo cp -r /etc/apt/apt.d.conf /etc/apt/apt.d.conf.original
2012-05-30T08:00:00.000Z	nydel	ms-daisy	the "-r" means recursive, you need this to copy a directory.
2012-05-30T08:05:00.000Z	ms-daisy	nydel	Okie dokie. I was trying to copy a directory. Epic fail. But now I've got the CORRECT conf files copied.  Thanks to all!
2012-05-30T08:05:00.000Z	nydel	ms-daisy	very welcome
