2009-09-03T11:49:00.000Z	Grundy		Flannel why does it matter?
2009-09-03T11:50:00.000Z	Grundy		Flannel let's answer the questions, then give the advice afterwards
2009-09-03T11:52:00.000Z	Myrtti	Grundy	so we should flood people with possibly wrong information that doesn't fit their usecases? "I want to build a bookcase" "here's a frozen salmon, frozen pike, some wood and nails" "you can use the salmon as a hammer"
2009-09-03T11:52:00.000Z	Grundy	Myrtti	wrong information? The question was "how do i install a ftp server"
2009-09-03T11:52:00.000Z	Myrtti	Grundy	and in most cases sftp would be better
2009-09-03T11:53:00.000Z	Grundy	Myrtti	if the question was "I need to transfer files. What are my options?", then you could answer it with alternatives
2009-09-03T11:53:00.000Z	Myrtti	Grundy	and most people that ask for ftp have no idea about the more secure alternatives
2009-09-03T11:54:00.000Z	Grundy	Myrtti	1) He doesn't care about the secure alternatives, he is transferring between 2 machines on the local network. 2) It is already done
2009-09-03T11:54:00.000Z	Grundy	Myrtti	ah, now you have your opening. Wall975 asked a very open ended question
2009-09-03T11:55:00.000Z	Grundy	Myrtti	I suppose we should present him with all alternatives from Samba to sending serial bit streams
2009-09-03T11:56:00.000Z	Myrtti	Grundy	1) having a secure local network now doesn't guarantee the computer that has ftpd will stay in there (might be a laptop) 2) this information is given to you as an advice to make you understand the implications that come with giving answers to questions that haven't been thought through by the person asking
2009-09-03T11:57:00.000Z	Grundy	Myrtti	as I said. He solved his problem and has moved on.
2009-09-03T11:57:00.000Z	Myrtti	Grundy	doesn't void the point 2)
2009-09-03T11:58:00.000Z	Grundy	Myrtti	because point 2 had such mangled syntax I didn't read it all
2009-09-03T11:58:00.000Z	Grundy	Myrtti	sorry, English is my native language
2009-09-03T11:58:00.000Z	Myrtti	Grundy	advice - don't give rushed answers
2009-09-03T11:59:00.000Z	Grundy	Myrtti	advice, answer the questions people ask. More advice, when people can google the answers, tell them to do so. It may bolster some people's ego to give out simple answers, but it does not help the person asking.
2009-09-03T12:00:00.000Z	Grundy	Myrtti	or, the next time someone asks about a problem with Gnome being slow, is the advice "Install (flux)(open)box"?
