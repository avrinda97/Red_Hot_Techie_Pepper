2007-11-17T10:06:00.000Z	Nikster		I've gotten XGL to run on my old nvidia geforce 2 card, but it just makes stuff really slow, and won't even run composite stuff.. anyone have a clue?
2007-11-17T10:08:00.000Z	usser	Nikster	xgl on nvidia?
2007-11-17T10:08:00.000Z	Nikster	usser	yeah? what should i use then?
2007-11-17T10:08:00.000Z	usser	Nikster	xorg built in composite extenstion with nvidia driver
2007-11-17T10:08:00.000Z	Nikster	usser	only thing that works for me is xcompmgr
2007-11-17T10:09:00.000Z	Nikster	usser	how do i enable it? if i try to enable desktop effects it just says it can't load them (yes, i have glx and composite enabled)
2007-11-17T10:10:00.000Z	usser	Nikster	hm, composite is enabled eh? i assume u have restricted driver installed?
2007-11-17T10:10:00.000Z	Nikster	usser	yes, i do
2007-11-17T10:10:00.000Z	usser	Nikster	and u run ubuntu? 7.10?
2007-11-17T10:10:00.000Z	usser	Nikster	try doing compiz --replace in console
2007-11-17T10:10:00.000Z	Nikster	usser	yes. But remember, it's a legacy card. but still
2007-11-17T10:11:00.000Z	Nikster	usser	it says Xgl is not present
2007-11-17T10:11:00.000Z	usser	Nikster	hm what model of card is that?
2007-11-17T10:12:00.000Z	Nikster	usser	Geforce 2 Pro/Gts
2007-11-17T10:12:00.000Z	usser	Nikster	huh
2007-11-17T10:13:00.000Z	Nikster	usser	?
2007-11-17T10:15:00.000Z	usser	Nikster	sorry i just have never used the legacy card by i'd guess that nvidia shouldnt ask for no xgl
2007-11-17T10:16:00.000Z	Nikster	usser	okay.. it just checks if xgl is present, and its not. then it falls back to metacity..
