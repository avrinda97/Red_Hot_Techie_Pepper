2011-03-12T20:45:00.000Z	RubenAlonzo		Greetings Everyone, i just installed (yesterday) Ubuntu 10.10 netbook remix and was wondering if there was a way to hide the side dock that is always present on the left?
2011-03-12T20:45:00.000Z	yuzodo	RubenAlonzo	not yet, 11.04 will have that feature
2011-03-12T20:52:00.000Z	yuzodo	RubenAlonzo	also see my PM
2011-03-12T20:53:00.000Z	yuzodo	RubenAlonzo	what are you using to chat on here?
2011-03-12T20:54:00.000Z	yuzodo	RubenAlonzo	then there should be a separate tab/window with me, depending how you configured it to look like
2011-03-12T20:55:00.000Z	yuzodo	RubenAlonzo	so do you see it?
2011-03-12T20:56:00.000Z	yuzodo	RubenAlonzo	how about a tab?
2011-03-13T04:23:00.000Z	yuzodo	RubenAlonzo	hey
2011-03-14T01:20:00.000Z	yuzodo	RubenAlonzo	MBR
2011-03-14T01:20:00.000Z	yuzodo	RubenAlonzo	wait, what other options are there?
2011-03-14T01:22:00.000Z	yuzodo	RubenAlonzo	no worries
2011-03-14T01:22:00.000Z	yuzodo	RubenAlonzo	did you catch my pm btw?
2011-03-14T01:24:00.000Z	RubenAlonzo	yuzodo	 yes i did but sorry about no reply, just bought this WD My Passport Elite 500GB and want to set it up as best i can, now it seems i have total of 750GB's of space, the Passport and the built in NetBook's 250GB :)
2011-03-14T01:28:00.000Z	yuzodo	RubenAlonzo	shoulda picked ext4 :D
2011-03-14T01:28:00.000Z	RubenAlonzo	yuzodo	is that an option froom the disk utility?
2011-03-14T01:33:00.000Z	yuzodo	RubenAlonzo	when you select MBR, you can select Ext4, but don't since you might need to export it to windows
2011-03-14T01:33:00.000Z	yuzodo	RubenAlonzo	so leave it like it is :)
2011-03-14T01:33:00.000Z	RubenAlonzo	yuzodo	 thanks will do
