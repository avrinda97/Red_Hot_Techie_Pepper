2008-10-20T08:26:00.000Z	anewson		ï»¿hey all having a problem with my new hardy install... i upgraded from 7.10, the did a fresh install of 8.04 when the upgrade didn't work... basically i think the problem is that hardy is seeing my IDE hard drives as scsi or something
2008-10-20T08:26:00.000Z	anewson		i'm a little new so i'm not sure that's right
2008-10-20T08:26:00.000Z	anewson		but cfdisk shows my partitions as sdx instead of hdx
2008-10-20T08:27:00.000Z	pajamian	anewson	that's normal for hardy
2008-10-20T08:27:00.000Z	pajamian	anewson	yep, it does the same for my drive which is ATA
2008-10-20T08:29:00.000Z	pajamian	anewson	what version of ubuntu are you using to try to mount the drives, and what version of ubuntu is the cfdisk taken from?
2008-10-20T08:29:00.000Z	pajamian	anewson	and the cfdisk?
2008-10-20T08:29:00.000Z	pajamian	anewson	ok, just checking.
2008-10-20T08:32:00.000Z	pajamian	anewson	can you see sda2 in your /dev directory?
2008-10-20T08:33:00.000Z	anewson	pajamian	hmm actually no
2008-10-20T08:33:00.000Z	anewson	pajamian	sda is the only one there
2008-10-20T08:33:00.000Z	pajamian	anewson	that would be your problem, then.
2008-10-20T08:34:00.000Z	pajamian	anewson	what about hda*?
2008-10-20T08:34:00.000Z	anewson	pajamian	no /dev/hdx
2008-10-20T08:35:00.000Z	pajamian	anewson	probably something to do with udev not seeing the partitions, then.
2008-10-20T08:35:00.000Z	anewson	pajamian	which is also probably why ubuntu won't boot, yeah?
2008-10-20T08:36:00.000Z	pajamian	anewson	and I wish I could say that I'm an expert on udev, but I'm not, but at least now you know a bit more about where to look.  Maybe you can find some info from googling, now.
