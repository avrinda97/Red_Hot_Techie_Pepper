2009-11-24T17:10:00.000Z	xoveruk		im not using redirection, LS is giving me files, for example. newfolder/ = a folder, newfileexecutable* = an executable file
2009-11-24T17:11:00.000Z	xoveruk		= socket | pipe
2009-11-24T17:11:00.000Z	xoveruk		@symbolic link
2009-11-24T17:11:00.000Z	xoveruk		what does the > mean when issungi 'ls -F'
2009-11-24T17:12:00.000Z	xoveruk		your still not listening
2009-11-24T17:12:00.000Z	xoveruk		if you type man ls and look at the -F switch you will understand me
2009-11-24T17:12:00.000Z	xoveruk		perhaps I am not being articulate enough
2009-11-24T17:13:00.000Z	xoveruk		is not redirection, its denoting a file type.
2009-11-24T17:13:00.000Z	xoveruk		yes, so what does the > mean?
2009-11-24T17:13:00.000Z	SpaceGhost	xoveruk	Look at the case
2009-11-24T17:14:00.000Z	SpaceGhost	xoveruk	It means put all output into
2009-11-24T17:14:00.000Z	SpaceGhost	xoveruk	Can you state your problem for me? I am grabbing blindly in the dark after something that I don't know if it exists.

2009-11-24T17:15:00.000Z	SpaceGhost	xoveruk	the pipe lets you put output into another command.
2009-11-24T17:28:00.000Z	SpaceGhost	xoveruk	you fascinate me.
2009-11-24T17:29:00.000Z	SpaceGhost	xoveruk	you went and attained the knowledge you hadn't posessed after it was already presented to you. In short, you made yourself look silly.
2009-11-24T17:30:00.000Z	SpaceGhost	xoveruk	the answer is simply no.
