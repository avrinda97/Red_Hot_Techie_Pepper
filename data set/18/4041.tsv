2009-06-23T07:16:00.000Z	vagothcpp		Is there any other way?
2009-06-23T07:16:00.000Z	loof	vagothcpp	: you're on the internet right now, dude
2009-06-23T07:17:00.000Z	vagothcpp		Yeh, with a jailbroken iPhone using wifi
2009-06-23T07:17:00.000Z	loof	vagothcpp	: download it to your iphone and copy it to your machine that way. :P
2009-06-23T07:17:00.000Z	loof	vagothcpp	: i'm assuming the iphone isn't a useless hunk of crap
2009-06-23T07:17:00.000Z	vagothcpp		download it from?
2009-06-23T07:18:00.000Z	loof	vagothcpp	: you said you needed to download an ndiswrapper, i'm assuming you know which one? :/
2009-06-23T07:19:00.000Z	vagothcpp		not really
2009-06-23T07:19:00.000Z	loof	vagothcpp	: http://sourceforge.net/projects/ndiswrapper/
2009-06-23T07:19:00.000Z	vagothcpp		and compile from source?
2009-06-23T07:20:00.000Z	loof	vagothcpp	: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDISwrapper read that if you don't understand it you're prolly better off not touching it
2009-06-23T07:21:00.000Z	vagothcpp		well asus wl-138G v2 doesnt compile and others have said that they've needed ndiswrapper
2009-06-23T07:22:00.000Z	loof	vagothcpp	: it didn't come with a linux driver? =S
2009-06-23T07:23:00.000Z	vagothcpp		It does, but wont compile
2009-06-23T07:24:00.000Z	loof	vagothcpp	: what's the compile error?
