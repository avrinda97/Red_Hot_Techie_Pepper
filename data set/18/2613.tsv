2010-12-15T00:27:00.000Z	robbie_tzr		Thanks gobbe; can I ask a further question - in terms of dealing with the possible implications of this, is it worth actually "breaking" the raid, ie, removing and formatting one disk, in order that I can perform a dummy-run of disk failure followed by disk renewal, and it regenerating?
2010-12-15T00:29:00.000Z	robbie_tzr		ok gobbe; sorry, it was posed as a question but more likely a scenario where this comes into play. I do have my desktop actually set up on a RAID5 basis. Thank you very much for your comments :)
2010-12-15T00:30:00.000Z	Walex	robbie_tzr	it could be a good idea, especially if you want to an idea of how long it takes to resync.
2010-12-15T00:32:00.000Z	Walex	robbie_tzr	storage system redundancy has nothing to do with filesystem operation.
2010-12-15T00:33:00.000Z	Walex	robbie_tzr	note that RAID5, RAID6 and other forms of parity RAID are usually a bad idea, except in a couple of narrow cases.
2010-12-15T00:33:00.000Z	Walex	robbie_tzr	'ext4' can also be very adventurous if you change some parameters :-).
2010-12-15T00:34:00.000Z	Walex	robbie_tzr	consider doing a web search for the "O_PONIES" debate...
2010-12-15T00:35:00.000Z	Walex	robbie_tzr	almost all filestem "benchmarks" are done by people who understand very little of what they are measuring. There are a lot of morons in that area.
2010-12-15T00:36:00.000Z	Walex	robbie_tzr	I personally recommend JFS and XFS. One day, one day NILFS2 will become very useful.
2010-12-15T00:36:00.000Z	Walex	robbie_tzr	things like 'ext3', 'ext4' and BTRFS exist only to let enterprise users update in-place without downtime.
2010-12-15T00:37:00.000Z	Walex	robbie_tzr	'ext4' is not too bad, but I still like JFS and XFS better.
2010-12-15T00:39:00.000Z	Walex	robbie_tzr	if you have an SSD things are *completely different*
2010-12-15T00:39:00.000Z	Walex	robbie_tzr	SSDs have A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT performance profile for the hard disks for which most file systems have been designed.,
2010-12-15T00:39:00.000Z	Walex	robbie_tzr	for that kind of SSD use 'ext2', and  *nothing else*.
2010-12-15T00:40:00.000Z	Walex	robbie_tzr	NILFS2 might be the filesystem of the future because it is particularly suitable for SSDs,.
2010-12-15T00:40:00.000Z	robbie_tzr	Walex	really ext2? Can you give me some more info/reasons for this choice of FS please?
2010-12-15T00:41:00.000Z	Walex	robbie_tzr	a 3-disk setup is one of the two cases where RAID5 makes some sense.
2010-12-15T00:43:00.000Z	Walex	robbie_tzr	I would definitely reinstall with 'ext2' on an SSD.
