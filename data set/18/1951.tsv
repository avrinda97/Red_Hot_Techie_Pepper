2010-10-06T22:25:00.000Z	zayr		I keep ssh port 22: Connection refused
2010-10-06T22:25:00.000Z	zayr		anyone know where can be problem ?
2010-10-06T22:25:00.000Z	erUSUL	zayr	a firewall ?
2010-10-06T22:27:00.000Z	zayr	erUSUL	ubuntu one ?
2010-10-06T22:31:00.000Z	erUSUL	zayr	you probably have to set up a port forwarding rule on the router
2010-10-06T22:32:00.000Z	zayr	erUSUL	its ok now
2010-10-09T23:16:00.000Z	erUSUL	zayr	PaX by the looks of it will never hit mainline linux
2010-10-09T23:17:00.000Z	zayr	erUSUL	And thats the problem ?
2010-10-09T23:17:00.000Z	erUSUL	zayr	what problem? if you want to use PaX patch your kernel
2010-10-09T23:18:00.000Z	zayr	erUSUL	but should be nice to have it out of box :P
2010-10-09T23:19:00.000Z	erUSUL	zayr	kernel developers tend to disagree with you; that's why it has not been integrated...
2010-10-09T23:20:00.000Z	zayr	erUSUL	but how is Ubuntu related to kernel problems ? they are making distro from parts which they want
2010-10-09T23:23:00.000Z	erUSUL	zayr	ubuntu made a choice too; you have apparmor by default and selinux in the repos
2010-10-11T18:11:00.000Z	erUSUL	zayr	sudo apt-get dist-upgrade never worked
2010-10-11T18:12:00.000Z	zayr	erUSUL	bsht it worked
2010-10-11T18:12:00.000Z	erUSUL	zayr	sudo do-release-upgrade
2010-10-11T18:12:00.000Z	erUSUL	zayr	not by itself. you have to edit sources by hand.
2010-10-11T18:12:00.000Z	erUSUL	zayr	and that's an unsuported way of upgrading. the update-mager does a better job
