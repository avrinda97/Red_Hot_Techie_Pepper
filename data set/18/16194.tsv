2004-11-03T09:23:00.000Z	Chris__		Ah.  Is there any way to get to 1024x768?  I've used that resolution with the same hardware under FC2, so it's not going to make the monitor explode or anything.  :-)
2004-11-03T09:25:00.000Z	ogra_	Chris__	run: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xerver-xfree86 in a console
2004-11-03T09:26:00.000Z	ogra_	Chris__	take all default answers and just adjust the resolution if you come to this
2004-11-03T09:39:00.000Z	Chris__	ogra_	I went through the configuration, but it showed 1024x768 already enabled (/etc/X11/XFree86-4 indicates the same).  Yet, I still can't get the display set to that resolution.
2004-11-03T09:42:00.000Z	ogra_	Chris__	don't you have 1024x786 in the resolution tool (Computer->System Tools->Screen Resolution (guessed, it's german here))
2004-11-03T09:42:00.000Z	Chris__	ogra_	Nope.
2004-11-03T09:46:00.000Z	ogra_	Chris__	sounds like your display isn't detected correctly.....the HorizSync and VertRefresh seem wrong, there is a tool to check these values, but i don't remember the name
2004-11-03T09:47:00.000Z	Chris__	ogra_	That's the weid thing... all of the information is dead on accurate.
2004-11-03T09:51:00.000Z	ogra_	Chris__	ctrl-alt-numlock_+ perhaps ?
2004-11-03T09:52:00.000Z	ogra_	Chris__	you can actually loop through :)
2004-11-03T09:54:00.000Z	ogra_	Chris__	if 1024 is in the Modelines in you XF86Config but not in the resolution tool thats really weird
2004-11-03T09:56:00.000Z	ogra_	Chris__	if you are sure the monitor values are actually correct, you should file a bug report
2004-11-03T09:57:00.000Z	ogra_	Chris__	probably this one: https://bugzilla.ubuntu.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2408
2004-11-03T10:02:00.000Z	ogra_	Chris__	got a llyama ?
2004-11-03T10:04:00.000Z	Chris__	ogra_	Nope.  It's an old integrated Rage Pro card.  I think it's 4 or 6MB or so.
2004-11-03T10:04:00.000Z	ogra_	Chris__	llyama is the monitor company the bugreport i pointed to is about
2004-11-03T10:08:00.000Z	ogra_	Chris__	if you don't like bugzilla youll probably like to send a mail with your prob to ubuntu-users@lists.ubuntu.com to nail this one down with a X developer
2004-11-03T10:09:00.000Z	Chris__	ogra_	Thank you for your help
