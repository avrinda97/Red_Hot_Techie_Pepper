2010-07-27T07:08:00.000Z	tpl2000		Alright, I edited the file...When I exit out of the terminal, will it have been saved?
2010-07-27T07:09:00.000Z	tpl2000		Alright, and it didn't actually change anything....
2010-07-27T07:11:00.000Z	tpl2000		None of these text editors will let me change the file
2010-07-27T07:11:00.000Z	tpl2000		Because it is read-only.
2010-07-27T07:13:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	tpl2000	is the file actually "read-only"?  use ls -l to see the permissions on the file and see if it's rwx for your user
2010-07-27T07:14:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	tpl2000	i wouldn't remove that file!  it's an L by the way

2010-07-27T07:27:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	tpl2000	you can use your windows install of wine.  See https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WorldofWarcraft for more details.
