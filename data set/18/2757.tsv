2010-03-01T06:24:00.000Z	tarehart		hey, I've got a jitter problem with my touchpad
2010-03-01T06:24:00.000Z	tarehart		can anybody help me out?
2010-03-01T06:26:00.000Z	garhol	tarehart	what is the problem with jitter?
2010-03-01T06:27:00.000Z	tarehart		the cursor shakes a few pixels back and forth when my finger is still
2010-03-01T06:28:00.000Z	tarehart		I found a website that suggested that the driver might not be averaging the input like it should
2010-03-01T06:29:00.000Z	garhol	tarehart	weird. no movement when your not holding a finger on the pad?
2010-03-01T06:29:00.000Z	tarehart	garhol	that's correct
2010-03-01T06:30:00.000Z	tarehart	garhol	and it was fine on 8.04 and windows 7
2010-03-01T06:32:00.000Z	garhol	tarehart	thinking, the synaptics touchpad stuff was listed in xorg.conf before but that is gone in 9.10 gimme a mo to look about
2010-03-01T06:32:00.000Z	tarehart	garhol	ok, thanks
2010-03-01T06:32:00.000Z	garhol	tarehart	out of interest, what make of system is it?
2010-03-01T06:33:00.000Z	tarehart		asus
2010-03-01T06:36:00.000Z	garhol	tarehart	sudo apt-get install gsynaptics  then turn down the minspead in there to slow. that should fix it
2010-03-01T06:37:00.000Z	garhol	tarehart	sorry, should be minspeed
2010-03-01T06:37:00.000Z	tarehart	garhol	that worked, thanks!
2010-03-01T06:38:00.000Z	garhol	tarehart	splendid :) have fun
2010-03-01T06:38:00.000Z	tarehart		and wow, xorg.conf is really minimal these days
2010-03-01T06:39:00.000Z	garhol	tarehart	yup, been a few people on tonight with nvidia issues andthe lack of xorg has thrown them a bit
