2010-10-25T16:20:00.000Z	jscinoz	SingAlong	which realtek card are you trying to get to work? if its the 8191/8192 the driver is currently in staging.
2010-10-25T16:20:00.000Z	jscinoz	SingAlong	if that's the case you'll probably need to build a custom kernel from git
2010-10-25T16:21:00.000Z	SingAlong	jscinoz	ouch! isnt that the same one you just warned me about? :(
2010-10-25T16:21:00.000Z	jscinoz	SingAlong	Is that the PCI or USB version?
2010-10-25T16:22:00.000Z	jscinoz	SingAlong	I don't actually use ubuntu on most of my machines, I'm a gentoo user... but to get my 8192SU to work, you need to enable the appropriate driver in the staging tree of the kernel config, then google for the firmware blog
2010-10-25T16:23:00.000Z	SingAlong	jscinoz	ya but mine says RTL8191SEvB. does that have problems too?
2010-10-25T16:23:00.000Z	jscinoz	SingAlong	it's not necessarily problems, its just that the driver is very new
2010-10-25T16:23:00.000Z	jscinoz	SingAlong	so its not in the default kernel, its in the staging tree
2010-10-25T16:25:00.000Z	SingAlong	jscinoz	is this a new card?
2010-10-25T16:28:00.000Z	SingAlong	jscinoz	if you have problems realtek is offering linux drivers here :) http://bit.ly/9PTbZv
2010-10-25T16:28:00.000Z	SingAlong	jscinoz	they have drivers for the 8192 series also. surprised. but yet to search for my model :)
2010-10-25T16:29:00.000Z	jscinoz	SingAlong	I have no problems at all
2010-10-25T16:30:00.000Z	jscinoz	SingAlong	the driver in kernel supports 8191S/SU/SE and 8192S/SU/SE
2010-10-25T16:30:00.000Z	SingAlong	jscinoz	ah ya point! you got me :)
2010-10-25T16:31:00.000Z	SingAlong	jscinoz	guess i'll install those custom kernels then
2010-10-25T16:33:00.000Z	SingAlong	jscinoz	Now going to install the staged version of the kernel from the git repo.
2010-10-25T16:33:00.000Z	SingAlong	jscinoz	any page you can point me to to build the latest kernel from the git repo?
2010-10-25T16:34:00.000Z	SingAlong	jscinoz	got it. np :)
