2006-02-26T08:40:00.000Z	kookaburra	jbmagic	it's a pretty straightforward install. so is debian sarge. just pick one and run with it.
2006-02-26T08:41:00.000Z	kookaburra	jbmagic	that is correct.
2006-02-26T08:45:00.000Z	kookaburra	jbmagic	what are you running now?
2006-02-26T08:49:00.000Z	kookaburra	jbmagic	if you have fairly common hardware I'd bet your install would be pretty straight forward. how commited are you to making a switch?
2006-02-26T08:59:00.000Z	kookaburra	jbmagic	right now I am running a little emachine 2.6 celeron with full multimedia capabilities. dvd ripping etc. so it can be done. I just took it home and immediately partitioned the hard drive for linux and installed. it never even booted windows.
2006-02-26T09:48:00.000Z	kookaburra	jbmagic	surf this link:  http://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=ubuntu
2006-02-26T09:52:00.000Z	kookaburra	jbmagic	that is up to your opinion. the entire install is only one cd. it isn't THAT huge compared to wondows xp.
2006-02-26T10:18:00.000Z	kookaburra	jbmagic	it does a great job.
2006-02-26T11:15:00.000Z	kookaburra	jbmagic	you really shouldn't have to compile much unless you write and compile your own programs.
2006-02-26T11:42:00.000Z	kookaburra	jbmagic	you would just change your sources.list file to the next release name and then apt-get update, apt-get dist-upgrade
