2009-10-03T13:51:00.000Z	CBro2007		guys I just got a Ubuntu 9.04 Desktop VM and installed it... it says it has no root password. So I added a new user and it gives me the message : myuser is not in the sudoers file.  This incident will be reported.
2009-10-03T13:52:00.000Z	CBro2007		how do I edit the sudoers file?
2009-10-03T13:52:00.000Z	CBro2007		also I want to change the root password
2009-10-03T13:53:00.000Z	CBro2007		wtf is this?
2009-10-03T13:53:00.000Z	CBro2007		:)
2009-10-03T13:54:00.000Z	CBro2007		so then to the non-bot members... how do I change my root password and also add my user to the list of sudoers on Ubuntu?
2009-10-03T13:54:00.000Z	Flannel	CBro2007	add the user to the admin group
2009-10-03T13:55:00.000Z	Flannel	CBro2007	sudo adduser username admin
2009-10-03T13:56:00.000Z	CBro2007	Flannel	so you suggest recreating the user? and this time giving it admin?
2009-10-03T13:56:00.000Z	Flannel	CBro2007	Er, do youcurrenly have no user with admin privledges?
2009-10-03T13:56:00.000Z	Flannel	CBro2007	the first user you create (during the install) has admin privledges
2009-10-03T13:56:00.000Z	Flannel	CBro2007	No, "adduser user group" merely adds the user to the group, not recreating a user.
2009-10-03T13:57:00.000Z	Flannel	CBro2007	then sudo adduser newuser admin
2009-10-03T13:58:00.000Z	CBro2007	Flannel	 that didn't work
2009-10-03T13:58:00.000Z	CBro2007	Flannel	do I log in as the admin user and then issue that command?
2009-10-03T13:58:00.000Z	CBro2007	Flannel	currently logged on as newuser
2009-10-03T13:58:00.000Z	Flannel	CBro2007	You need to be on your admin user, then sudo adduser newuser admin (where "newuser" is the username of your other use)
2009-10-03T13:59:00.000Z	Flannel	CBro2007	you can't give yourself higher privledges ;)
