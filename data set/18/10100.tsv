2007-01-13T13:42:00.000Z	michael117	WarLord	are you in the live CD now?
2007-01-13T13:44:00.000Z	michael117	WarLord	You should be able to use GParted and delete both of the partitions you said you made. Make sure it shows a large block of unallocated space. Make the swap, then make the / root partition
2007-01-13T13:44:00.000Z	michael117	WarLord	No
2007-01-13T13:44:00.000Z	WarLord	michael117	then ?
2007-01-13T13:45:00.000Z	michael117	WarLord	Swap is like what the page file is in Windows. How much RAM is in your laptop?
2007-01-13T13:46:00.000Z	michael117	WarLord	By default, 600MB is usually allocated and I personally use 1 GB
2007-01-13T13:51:00.000Z	michael117	WarLord	Yes, wine emulates the windows API
2007-01-13T13:51:00.000Z	michael117	WarLord	Wine Is Not an Emulator
2007-01-13T13:52:00.000Z	michael117	WarLord	winehq.com
2007-01-13T13:53:00.000Z	michael117	WarLord	It's no where near perfect, but very impressive if you consider that the wine developers have created the ability to run a windows app from scratch
2007-01-13T13:54:00.000Z	michael117	WarLord	Also, you might want to look into Crossover Office if you want to run MS Office
