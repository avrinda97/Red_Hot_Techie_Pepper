2009-01-13T15:04:00.000Z	aurora		Hey, could anyone explain what might be the problem when I connect to my server using tightvncserver from a remote machine, I just get a chequered screen and nothing else? It connects fine but I see nothing other than that...thanks!
2009-01-13T15:05:00.000Z	clearzen	aurora	there are several settings that could cause the improper return of a xsession to a client pc
2009-01-13T15:06:00.000Z	clearzen	aurora	how are you forwarding X?
2009-01-13T15:06:00.000Z	aurora	clearzen	any obvious ones? it's a fresh install
2009-01-13T15:06:00.000Z	clearzen	aurora	using tightvnc a windows pc and a ubuntu box?
2009-01-13T15:07:00.000Z	aurora	clearzen	yes
2009-01-13T15:07:00.000Z	clearzen	aurora	is the ubuntu box the host?
2009-01-13T15:07:00.000Z	aurora	clearzen	All I've done is a fresh install, then sudo apt-get install tightvncserver
2009-01-13T15:07:00.000Z	aurora	clearzen	yes, it's the host
2009-01-13T15:08:00.000Z	clearzen	aurora	how long have you let the connection sit? Is it just being slow?
2009-01-13T15:08:00.000Z	aurora	clearzen	I've left it for about 2 minutes and it just stays on that chequered screen
2009-01-13T15:09:00.000Z	clearzen	aurora	ok, is both machines on the same local network?
2009-01-13T15:10:00.000Z	aurora	clearzen	yes, both local lan
2009-01-13T15:10:00.000Z	clearzen	aurora	just covering bases, but the router is set to allow all communication over the lan right
2009-01-13T15:11:00.000Z	aurora	clearzen	yes, there's only a switch between hosts
2009-01-13T15:12:00.000Z	clearzen	aurora	do you have vnc setup to use ssh?
2009-01-13T15:12:00.000Z	aurora	clearzen	no ssh involved
2009-01-13T15:13:00.000Z	clearzen	aurora	one sec
