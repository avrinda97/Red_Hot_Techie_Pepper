2012-05-12T08:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ztag100	i use web stuff mostly, so not sure personally. I've seen people say it's ok
2012-10-04T08:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ztag100	newer kernel and drivers. Quantal isn't LTS.
2012-10-04T08:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ztag100	http://ubuntulife.net/whats-new-in-ubuntu-12-10-alpha-1/
2012-10-04T08:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ztag100	the gnome based release will be Unity3D and no 2D
2012-10-04T08:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ztag100	pretty big overhaul imho (if you don't use unity then you won't be affected)
2012-10-04T08:05:00.000Z	ztag100	ActionParsnip	doesn't sound like anything that will really affect me, will it?
2012-10-04T08:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ztag100	if you can run Unity3D you will equally be unaffected
2012-10-04T08:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ztag100	later version of Unity too. bug fixes, the usual jive
2012-10-04T08:08:00.000Z	ztag100	ActionParsnip	there's also the potential debate between Ubuntu and Fedora, which I'm not quite sure about
2012-10-04T08:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ztag100	debate about what?
2012-10-04T08:09:00.000Z	ztag100	ActionParsnip	well, I'm not sure what I want to use on the machine
