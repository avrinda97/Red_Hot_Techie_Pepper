2004-10-27T11:24:00.000Z	hazmat		er. from debian
2004-10-27T11:25:00.000Z	hazmat		because ubuntu is trying hard to be a gui desktop..
2004-10-27T11:25:00.000Z	hazmat		i mean every part of the system is confiugrable via the gui
2004-10-27T11:25:00.000Z	hazmat		except the runlevel, packages, config, umounting, etc.
2004-10-27T11:25:00.000Z	Keybuk	hazmat	what is installed is configurable; trying to present a separate "installed but not activated" layer is confusing
2004-10-27T11:26:00.000Z	hazmat	Keybuk	no its not, there are items like that in mac and windows, ie do you want to turn on sharing, do you want to ABC, etc. 
2004-10-27T11:26:00.000Z	Keybuk	hazmat	that's different though :o)
2004-10-27T11:27:00.000Z	Keybuk	hazmat	you appear to be missing the point; I'm saying people don't need to do this *at all*
2004-10-27T11:28:00.000Z	hazmat	Keybuk	then why should people even have a gui package manager, they don't need that ;-)
2004-10-27T11:29:00.000Z	Keybuk	hazmat	installing and updating software is a common activity
2004-10-27T12:04:00.000Z	hazmat	Keybuk	whoa configurable does not mean its not useable out of the box
2004-10-27T12:05:00.000Z	Keybuk	hazmat	<Keybuk> configurability isn't bad
2004-10-27T12:07:00.000Z	Keybuk	hazmat	right-click the pager, Preferences, and change the number of desktops)
2004-10-27T12:08:00.000Z	hazmat	Keybuk	doesn't affect anything unfortunately
2004-10-27T12:08:00.000Z	Keybuk	hazmat	you're running metacity?
2004-10-27T12:10:00.000Z	hazmat	Keybuk	yup that did it, thanks
2004-10-27T12:10:00.000Z	Keybuk	hazmat	out of interest, have you done an upgrade recently and not logged out/rebooted since ?
2004-10-27T12:42:00.000Z	Keybuk	hazmat	there was a wonderful moment at GUADEC this year
