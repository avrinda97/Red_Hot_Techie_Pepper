2011-03-09T21:18:00.000Z	Joooon		hey guys I have a bit of an emergency anyone ahve experience with subversion?
2011-03-09T21:20:00.000Z	Joooon		Last night before I went to bed my SVN server was working fine, anyway this morning I tried to get my code from it and I get this error <m:human-readable errcode="2">
2011-03-09T21:20:00.000Z	Joooon		Could not open the requested SVN filesystem
2011-03-09T21:20:00.000Z	Joooon		</m:human-readable>.....my web svn is working fine and shows the code and every as still there
2011-03-09T21:21:00.000Z	Joooon		I did modify my SSH server last night would that be theproblem?
2011-03-09T21:21:00.000Z	Joooon		but I'm using http to host the repos
2011-03-09T21:22:00.000Z	raido	Joooon	but when you do an update your doing it over ssh correct?
2011-03-09T21:24:00.000Z	raido	Joooon	Well, ive not seent that error but I have had SVN get wierd on me related to ssh differences. So I would suspect that whatever you did with ssh is causing the issue.
2011-03-09T21:27:00.000Z	raido	Joooon	You need to make that change in the svn configs too. See here http://www.techper.net/2009/01/11/changing-port-number-of-svnssh-subversion-protocol/
2011-03-09T21:28:00.000Z	raido	Joooon	oops, thats different
2011-03-09T21:28:00.000Z	Joooon	raido	when im doing a regular svn grab is uses SSH ? i thought it only used http
2011-03-09T21:28:00.000Z	raido	Joooon	thats for a tunnel
2011-03-09T21:29:00.000Z	raido	Joooon	Well if your doing it from the command line its using ssh. You may be adressing the dir of your repo which is in a WWW rood dir but the xfr is going over ssh
2011-03-09T21:32:00.000Z	raido	Joooon	oh
2011-03-09T21:33:00.000Z	Joooon	raido	so like http://mydomain.com/svn/projectname and that was working great
2011-03-09T21:34:00.000Z	raido	Joooon	ok
2011-03-09T21:37:00.000Z	Joooon	raido	any idea?
2011-03-09T21:39:00.000Z	raido	Joooon	sorry pal, I never used it like that, you have me at loss
