2005-07-02T07:53:00.000Z	xxtreme	nalioth	dangit
2005-07-02T07:53:00.000Z	nalioth	xxtreme	freescale has revealed some 1.67ghz G4s (and whispers about dual-core G4s are heard)
2005-07-02T10:17:00.000Z	xxtreme	nalioth	you say take out backports in repositories
2005-07-02T10:17:00.000Z	nalioth	xxtreme	i say only use them for a single program you want, and then comment them back out
2005-07-02T10:17:00.000Z	nalioth	xxtreme	because everyday use will sooner or later botch your upgradeability
2005-07-02T10:17:00.000Z	xxtreme	nalioth	oh ok, also marillat
2005-07-02T10:18:00.000Z	nalioth	xxtreme	yes any unofficial repository

2005-10-30T06:34:00.000Z	nalioth	xxtreme	i'm not much on adjusting input devices
