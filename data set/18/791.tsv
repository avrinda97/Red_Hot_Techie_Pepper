2011-09-07T12:30:00.000Z	khaliG		this might be a stupid question, but is there a way to make ubuntu look the way it used to?
2011-09-07T12:32:00.000Z	asdjaputra	khaliG	if you use it for a while you'll get used to it
2011-09-07T12:33:00.000Z	khaliG	asdjaputra	lol but i hate it, and no i never will! :)
2011-09-07T12:33:00.000Z	asdjaputra	khaliG	i tried another distro to avoid it (Deb) but it looks so cool i can't resist to use it :D
2011-09-07T12:34:00.000Z	asdjaputra	khaliG	as ActionParsnip said, jump to another DE/WM
2011-09-07T12:34:00.000Z	khaliG	asdjaputra	i guess its just familiarity
2011-09-07T12:34:00.000Z	asdjaputra	khaliG	yep, it's still in development state btw, so do expect bugs
2011-09-07T12:34:00.000Z	khaliG	asdjaputra	the new look is?
2011-09-07T12:35:00.000Z	asdjaputra	khaliG	yes
2011-09-07T12:36:00.000Z	asdjaputra	khaliG	fluxbox :)
2011-09-07T12:37:00.000Z	khaliG	asdjaputra	i wanted to get away from all that tinkering :/
2011-09-07T12:37:00.000Z	asdjaputra	khaliG	in blackbox or unity?
2011-09-07T12:38:00.000Z	khaliG	asdjaputra	blackbox, I used to waste too much time setting up keybindings and refining them - so forced myself to switch to vanilla ubuntu years back
2011-09-07T12:42:00.000Z	asdjaputra	khaliG	try fluxbox it has keyboard shortcuts preconfigured
2011-09-07T12:44:00.000Z	khaliG	asdjaputra	not cool though, they shouldn't make the out of box experience so bad
2011-09-07T12:52:00.000Z	asdjaputra	khaliG	Canonical
2011-09-07T12:53:00.000Z	asdjaputra	khaliG	no use of complaints here, try to speak it with Mark
2011-09-07T12:56:00.000Z	asdjaputra	khaliG	no swearing to the gods :D
