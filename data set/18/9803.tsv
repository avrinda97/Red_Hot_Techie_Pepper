2007-08-20T05:18:00.000Z	RenatoSilva		about 5 ot 6
2007-08-20T05:18:00.000Z	ConstyXIV	RenatoSilva	what sort of OSes?
2007-08-20T05:18:00.000Z	ConstyXIV	RenatoSilva	just windows and a few other linux distros?
2007-08-20T05:19:00.000Z	RenatoSilva	ConstyXIV	Kubuntu+  Vista on extended, Windows XP on primary, swap on xtended
2007-08-20T05:19:00.000Z	RenatoSilva	ConstyXIV	yes
2007-08-20T05:20:00.000Z	RenatoSilva	ConstyXIV	?????????
2007-08-20T05:20:00.000Z	ConstyXIV	RenatoSilva	yeah, it should pick those up.  I know for a fact the text-based (alternate) installer will show you a list of all of them, but it's been so long since I've installed over windows that I wouldn't know if the desktop installer does
2007-08-20T05:21:00.000Z	RenatoSilva	ConstyXIV	but ubuntu's installer was always desktop-like
2007-08-20T05:22:00.000Z	ConstyXIV	RenatoSilva	you apparently weren't around in the 5.10 days
2007-08-20T05:22:00.000Z	RenatoSilva	ConstyXIV	really i weren't :D
2007-08-20T05:23:00.000Z	ConstyXIV	RenatoSilva	as faileas said, it apparently does pick everything up like it (still) should
2007-08-20T05:24:00.000Z	RenatoSilva	ConstyXIV	but it will not recognize vista and xp, but only one of them...:D
2007-08-20T05:25:00.000Z	RenatoSilva	ConstyXIV	i'm not undertanding
2007-08-20T05:25:00.000Z	RenatoSilva	ConstyXIV	will i have to install vista after xp???
