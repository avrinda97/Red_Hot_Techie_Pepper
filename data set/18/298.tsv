2012-09-05T07:39:00.000Z	Guddu	jagginess	 Alternate Install CD is a different CD then what i used to install at first place?
2012-09-05T07:40:00.000Z	jagginess	Guddu	let me know if this helps.. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair
2012-09-05T07:40:00.000Z	Guddu	jagginess	 Checking now
2012-09-05T07:50:00.000Z	Guddu	jagginess	 I got disconnected....I am downloading Boot Repair CD now. Will take 20 Minutes and 10 Minutes to Burn the CD. Will you be here?
2012-09-05T07:54:00.000Z	jagginess	Guddu	the install cd/dvd of ubuntu has tools in command-line mode to fix your ubuntu, but it's not very attractive, if the boot-repair iso you'll be trying sux, then the more difficult way of fixing it should be doable (and many people have been using the more difficult way)
2012-09-05T07:54:00.000Z	jagginess	Guddu	i have no idea how really good that boot-repair iso is, so it would be nice to know if it is helpful :)
2012-09-05T07:55:00.000Z	jagginess	Guddu	but its mentioned on the community ubuntu wiki, so i'm wildly guessing it must be pretty stable
2012-09-05T07:55:00.000Z	Guddu	jagginess	 While it downloads, i can try Command Line way....As i have the origina installer CD with me.
2012-09-05T07:56:00.000Z	jagginess	Guddu	it's very geeky you'll really be turned off by it
