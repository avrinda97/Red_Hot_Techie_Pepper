2007-11-02T20:50:00.000Z	bluefox83	mkeith_	make sure you still have a windows entry in your grub config file, i think it's /boot/grub/menu.lst
2007-11-02T20:50:00.000Z	mkeith_		I have it
2007-11-02T20:53:00.000Z	bluefox83		no O.o
2007-11-02T20:54:00.000Z	mkeith_	bluefox83	do you have any more ideas on how I can get back into windows
2007-11-02T20:55:00.000Z	bluefox83	mkeith_	did you fix your menu.lst?
2007-11-02T20:55:00.000Z	mkeith_		yes it was always there and it still won't boot into windows
2007-11-02T20:56:00.000Z	bluefox83	mkeith_	it's not commented out with a # is it?

2007-11-02T20:57:00.000Z	bluefox83	mkeith_	did it list the windows option?
2007-11-02T20:57:00.000Z	mkeith_		yes
