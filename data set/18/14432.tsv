2005-08-03T08:07:00.000Z	frank	jake1	well usually you can find everything you need to build on synaptic
2005-08-03T08:10:00.000Z	frank	jake1	the package is called libxext-dev
2005-08-03T08:10:00.000Z	jake1	frank	how does one know what package things of such refer to
2005-08-03T08:11:00.000Z	frank	jake1	you do a search for it in synaptic. and you always need the -dev one to compile with
2005-08-03T08:12:00.000Z	frank	jake1	i did a search for libxext and got the right one
2005-08-03T08:13:00.000Z	frank	jake1	well that is what ./configure checks
2005-08-03T08:14:00.000Z	frank	jake1	the package is called libxext-dev
2005-08-03T08:16:00.000Z	frank	jake1	yeah I'm not sure about that
2005-08-03T08:25:00.000Z	frank	jake1	no
