2008-08-04T19:19:00.000Z	chamunks		hey does someone here know how to print a pdf in a way that it prints 4 sheets onto one page but in a way that i can fold the paper and it be like a book?
2008-08-04T19:20:00.000Z	chamunks		this way cutting my paper usage in 1/4th?
2008-08-04T19:22:00.000Z	chamunks		Theres a single word for this proceedure but i cant remember what it was.. but to print 4 pages to one sheet of paper so that when folded and binded they end up in proper reading order..
2008-08-04T19:23:00.000Z	chamunks		I think the word started with a C or S but this might only help in finding out what it is im looking for.
2008-08-04T19:24:00.000Z	hwilde	chamunks	did you even try it?  just go to Print then hit Options tell it 4 pages per sheet it's so easy
2008-08-04T19:25:00.000Z	chamunks	hwilde	yes what im looking for is to essentially print on totally one side and fold the paper in quarters... or fold it in half
2008-08-04T19:25:00.000Z	chamunks	hwilde	thus printing the sheets in a strange order
2008-08-04T19:26:00.000Z	chamunks	hwilde	like pages 1 , 4 on out side and 2,3 on the inside
2008-08-11T07:51:00.000Z	hwilde	chamunks	yes
2008-08-11T07:53:00.000Z	chamunks	hwilde	as i figured i just needed to know im not chasing ghosts..
