2005-04-11T12:22:00.000Z	holycow		okay, installing nvidia drivers still requires that i use the 'debian way' correct?
2005-04-11T12:23:00.000Z	Dreamer3	holycow	debian way is never required, but it's the best ;-)
2005-04-11T12:23:00.000Z	Dreamer3	holycow	hey, your look familiar, did you use to work at Gateway? ;-)
2005-04-11T12:25:00.000Z	holycow	Dreamer3	ehe :)
2005-04-22T12:07:00.000Z	Dreamer3	holycow	i think gumstix is pretty coo, but prolly too small for my purposes :)
2005-04-22T12:07:00.000Z	holycow	Dreamer3	i think way too small :)
2005-04-22T12:08:00.000Z	Dreamer3	holycow	i mean i COULD see uses... bluetooth with a battery sounds like cool portable storage to me, but i'd have to build a case and do the battery thing all myself :)
2005-04-22T12:08:00.000Z	holycow	Dreamer3	i can't see its uses beyond fancy remote control, mp3 player, or some device driver say like they have with the link for the epaper thingy
2005-04-22T12:17:00.000Z	Dreamer3	holycow	hmmm, seems if i add the etherstix i have no place left for storage...
2005-04-22T12:19:00.000Z	Dreamer3	holycow	so the question is what can one do with 64 of ram and 4mb of flash and ethernet? :)
2005-04-22T12:19:00.000Z	holycow	Dreamer3	not a lot :) haha
2005-04-22T12:32:00.000Z	Dreamer3	holycow	what?
2005-04-22T12:35:00.000Z	holycow	Dreamer3	Xgates is our local slackware convert, he will be optimizing down to the nanosecond :)
2005-04-22T12:35:00.000Z	Dreamer3	holycow	*laughs*
2005-04-22T12:35:00.000Z	holycow	Dreamer3	he jsut recompiled the kernle to his specs hehe
2005-04-22T12:36:00.000Z	Dreamer3	holycow	you know for the first time ever i haven't felt a need to build my own kernel...
2005-04-22T12:36:00.000Z	Dreamer3	holycow	*Shrugs*
2005-04-22T12:36:00.000Z	Dreamer3	holycow	i was mildly annoyed that i had to rebuild the initrd to turn off vesafb though, even though it turned out not to matter :)
