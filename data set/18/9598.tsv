2007-05-12T07:10:00.000Z	Fossilet		Hello. How can I run the actually sh instead of bash?
2007-05-12T07:11:00.000Z	Fossilet		Thanks.
2007-05-12T07:11:00.000Z	Slart	Fossilet	tried running "sh" in the console?
2007-05-12T07:11:00.000Z	Slart	Fossilet	hmm.. mine isn't
2007-05-12T07:12:00.000Z	Fossilet	Slart	which distro do you use?
2007-05-12T07:12:00.000Z	Slart	Fossilet	I guess if you knew where the actual file is you could run it with the full path   (bin/sh) or something
2007-05-12T07:12:00.000Z	Slart	Fossilet	ubuntu feisty fawn
2007-05-12T07:13:00.000Z	Fossilet	Slart	/bin/sh looks like sh, but it behaves like bash. press ctrl-x ctrl-v gives the version info of gnu bash.
2007-05-12T07:14:00.000Z	Slart	Fossilet	once again I have to disagree.. I have a separate sh shell.. different from bash and ctrl-x ctrl-v doesn't give me anything in sh
2007-05-12T07:15:00.000Z	Fossilet	Slart	I am also using ubuntu 7.04. ...why mine is bash...
2007-05-12T07:15:00.000Z	Slart	Fossilet	I upgraded from Edgy.. did you do a fresh install?
2007-05-12T07:15:00.000Z	Fossilet	Slart	I upgraded from edgy too.
2007-05-12T07:16:00.000Z	Slart	Fossilet	most weird.. let me search and see if I have an executable for sh somewhere
2007-05-12T07:16:00.000Z	Fossilet	Slart	thank you~
2007-05-12T07:18:00.000Z	Slart	Fossilet	here's my bin dir.. it's linked to somerthing called dash...
2007-05-12T07:18:00.000Z	Slart	Fossilet	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/20483/
2007-05-12T07:21:00.000Z	Fossilet	Slart	Then i installed dash. And then sh is no longer bash. Thanks.
2007-05-12T07:21:00.000Z	Slart	Fossilet	funny.. can't remember installing it.. well well.. it seems to work.. let's not mess with it
