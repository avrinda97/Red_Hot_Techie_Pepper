2010-07-04T13:33:00.000Z	Taev		yeah, now how do i get rid of this stupid ass version and reinstall the old version that actually worked?
2010-07-04T13:35:00.000Z	Taev		its 3.6.6
2010-07-04T13:36:00.000Z	Taev		damn it, where is the old firefox releases on mozilla.com ?
2010-07-04T13:37:00.000Z	mneptok	Taev	did you add a PPA or enable backports to get this new version?
2010-07-04T13:40:00.000Z	mneptok	Taev	move your ~/.mozilla directory aside and see if it crashes.
2010-07-04T13:40:00.000Z	mneptok	Taev	sure
2010-07-04T13:41:00.000Z	mneptok	Taev	no.
2010-07-04T13:46:00.000Z	mneptok	Taev	that's not the best solution. the best solution is to determine why Firefox gives you such problems, but not others.
2010-07-04T13:50:00.000Z	mneptok	Taev	because running as root is dangerous, is not supported, and will not be discussed on this channel per policy.
2010-07-04T13:50:00.000Z	mneptok	Taev	i think you need to accept that Firefox is probably not the issue, and something about your configuration is.
2010-07-04T13:51:00.000Z	mneptok	Taev	as i said before, move aside your Firefox profile or test with the guest account.
