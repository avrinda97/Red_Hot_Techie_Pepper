2004-12-17T16:57:00.000Z	davmor2		how can I install xorg on my warty system then please I haven't seen it anywhere
2004-12-17T16:59:00.000Z	Ng	davmor2	NO
2004-12-17T16:59:00.000Z	Ng	davmor2	hoary isn't even slightly stable
2004-12-18T16:31:00.000Z	Ng	davmor2	yeah
2004-12-18T16:35:00.000Z	Ng	davmor2	kinda, ish. it has advantages and disadvantages
2004-12-18T16:37:00.000Z	Ng	davmor2	it means things like 32bit video codecs don't work without a 32bit chroot and some WINE things can be a bit of a pain
2004-12-18T16:37:00.000Z	Ng	davmor2	but generally I think it's a good move
2004-12-18T16:37:00.000Z	Ng	davmor2	I suspect that most of the "it's nicer than my old system" is more down to the larger busses than the CPU, since I went 2ghz 32bit->2ghz 64bit
2005-10-24T16:46:00.000Z	Ng	davmor2	glxgears doesn't run at unlimited speed and print out fps anymore, if you're using breezy.
2005-10-24T16:48:00.000Z	davmor2	Ng	thanks but cedega tries to use it then it comes up with no 3d acceleration
2005-10-24T16:48:00.000Z	Ng	davmor2	?!
2005-10-24T16:48:00.000Z	Ng	davmor2	is that point2play or something?
2005-10-24T16:48:00.000Z	davmor2	Ng	and yes I'm running breezy
2005-10-24T16:49:00.000Z	davmor2	Ng	yes point to play small as I'm running 64bit
2005-10-24T16:49:00.000Z	Ng	davmor2	pass, it's a problem Transgaming will need to fix. You can just invoke cedega from the command line if you want
2005-10-24T16:50:00.000Z	davmor2	Ng	how
2005-10-24T16:50:00.000Z	Ng	davmor2	cedega ~/.transgaming/c_drive/wherever/the/game/is/installed.exe
2005-10-24T16:50:00.000Z	davmor2	Ng	ta
