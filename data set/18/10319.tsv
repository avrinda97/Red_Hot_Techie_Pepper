2006-12-18T13:26:00.000Z	seba-		it works on my primary but not secondary computer
2006-12-18T13:27:00.000Z	seba-		so, i'm repeating the question, does anybody know what could it be wrong: it starts everything and then logs off, then logs back in and logs off back again, infinite loop.
2006-12-18T13:27:00.000Z	seba-		live cd ubuntu 6.10 desktop i386
2006-12-18T13:27:00.000Z	seba-		yes
2006-12-18T13:27:00.000Z	seba-		why eek ? :(
2006-12-18T13:28:00.000Z	seba-		i just want a livecd for my mom, so she can't fuck up anything and play with linux while she retains her windows.
2006-12-18T13:28:00.000Z	seba-		live
2006-12-18T13:29:00.000Z	seba-		no
2006-12-18T13:29:00.000Z	seba-		i'm just running it
2006-12-18T13:29:00.000Z	seba-		it works on the second computer
2006-12-18T13:29:00.000Z	pike_	seba-	if x is crashing after login you might try a different livecd not sure how youd perm fix that
2006-12-18T13:29:00.000Z	seba-		is not crashing, like it works for a second, then just logs off.
2006-12-18T13:29:00.000Z	seba-		hm, i did integrity check, it said is ok. hm.
2006-12-18T13:30:00.000Z	seba-		maybe the cdrom is bad there
2006-12-18T13:30:00.000Z	seba-		but the iso is fine
2006-12-18T13:30:00.000Z	pike_	seba-	does it say logging off or are you saying that because it goes back to the logins creen
2006-12-18T13:30:00.000Z	seba-		it was downloaded via torrent
2006-12-18T13:31:00.000Z	seba-	pike_	well i think it crashes, i don't know why, i can even double click "examples" sometimes.
