2011-01-22T05:48:00.000Z	Varc		Is you write "inkscape" this open the program but if you close it from the interzafe this close the program with the terminal
2011-01-22T05:48:00.000Z	Varc		I am new men, xD I am seeying how to install programs with the terminal
2011-01-22T05:48:00.000Z	Varc		And how run it
2011-01-22T05:50:00.000Z	Noeltorious	Varc	and sometimes the package name differs from the program name itself
2011-01-22T05:50:00.000Z	Varc	Noeltorious	How can i know it?
2011-01-22T05:53:00.000Z	Noeltorious	Varc	and what i'll do somethimes is sudo apt-get *part of the program* and hit tab to see possibilites, downside is sometimes you get a ton of hits
2011-01-22T05:54:00.000Z	Noeltorious	Varc	ex: sudo apt-get install chrom and hit tab, pulls up a bunch of chromium packages
2011-01-22T05:55:00.000Z	Varc	Noeltorious	I see, if i put dpkg-query -L package How can i know what is the program to run? Are .exe like Windows?
2011-01-22T05:57:00.000Z	Noeltorious	Varc	are you wanting to install a package you dl'd or that is in the repositories?
2011-01-22T05:59:00.000Z	Varc	Noeltorious	Look, If i download a program, and i wanna install it from the terminal i write sudo apt-get intall application and the PackAge don't have the name of the program how can i find the executable?
2011-01-22T06:00:00.000Z	Noeltorious	Varc	okay i think im finally there with you, this is a .deb file youve downloaded?
2011-01-22T06:01:00.000Z	Varc	Noeltorious	No, is just a example i don't have problems with software now
