2008-07-05T10:28:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Gazingson	what wireless card are you using
2008-07-05T10:29:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Gazingson	lspci and find it
2008-07-05T10:29:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Gazingson	open up a terminal and type lspci
2008-07-05T10:33:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Gazingson	it's in application menu, or hit alt-f2 and type gnome-terminal
2008-07-05T10:35:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Gazingson	now scroll through and tell us the wireless card, or just paste the entire output to pastebin.com
2008-07-05T10:35:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Gazingson	pastebin.com now in here
2008-07-05T10:38:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Gazingson	it should be longer than that.
2008-07-05T10:39:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Gazingson	you didn't paste the whole output
2008-07-05T10:39:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Gazingson	no
2008-07-05T10:45:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Gazingson	just google everything, and put the word ubuntu in any search term you google for.  most of the time you'll find your solution in the first page of results or so
2008-07-06T11:07:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Gazingson	what program
2008-07-06T11:08:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Gazingson	use wine to install it
2008-07-06T11:42:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Gazingson	if wine is installed correctly, you should be able to just double click on the setup file on the cd
