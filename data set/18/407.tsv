2012-03-01T01:31:00.000Z	naftilos76		hi everyone, i need to make a script to connect via ssh to my remote server, dump my database and close the connection and finally end the script. However when i run the script i can see that i am connected to my ssh server but i need to type all the rest to dump the database and close the connection. There is obviously something i need to add to the script to execute all commands. Can anyone help?
2012-03-01T01:33:00.000Z	bluefrog_	naftilos76	what for? what is the final goal?
2012-03-01T01:34:00.000Z	bluefrog_	naftilos76	you want to retrieve the dumped db zt home, correct?
2012-03-01T01:34:00.000Z	naftilos76	bluefrog_	i need to put the script into cron and dump my file everyday or whenever i want
2012-03-01T01:35:00.000Z	naftilos76	bluefrog_	do i need to elaborate more on that?
2012-03-01T01:35:00.000Z	bluefrog_	naftilos76	no. the first sentence was not that elaborate, now we know what you want to do
2012-03-01T01:37:00.000Z	naftilos76	bluefrog_	A script obviously behaves differently than a konsole prompt. Do you know what i need to add to the code to make all commands after the "ssh bla bla bla my_server" ?
2012-03-01T01:38:00.000Z	naftilos76	bluefrog_	i meant  make the rest of the commands execute
2012-03-01T01:38:00.000Z	bluefrog_	naftilos76	if you can wait I may be able to retrieve something I put in place on a server to do exactly what you want to do
2012-03-01T01:39:00.000Z	bluefrog_	naftilos76	just need time to search for it
2012-03-01T01:39:00.000Z	naftilos76		i do something similar with ftp command via script
2012-03-01T01:40:00.000Z	naftilos76	bluefrog_	what makes the difference is that at the end of the first line i have to add "<< EOT" and also at the last line of the code
2012-03-01T01:41:00.000Z	naftilos76	bluefrog_	if i do not add the "<< EOT" only the first line executes
2012-03-01T01:41:00.000Z	naftilos76		i tried the same with ssh but it doesn't work
2012-03-01T01:46:00.000Z	naftilos76	bluefrog_	i think i got it please do not bother
2012-03-01T01:46:00.000Z	bluefrog_	naftilos76	ok
2012-03-01T02:15:00.000Z	bluefrog_	naftilos76	you got it working?
2012-03-01T02:20:00.000Z	naftilos76	bluefrog_	more or less
