2012-05-14T21:37:00.000Z	hceylan		Ä± would like to stop the downscaling to cool the cpu
2012-05-14T21:37:00.000Z	hceylan		when cpu is not used it clocks it doen right?
2012-05-14T21:37:00.000Z	hceylan		I would like to disable that
2012-05-14T21:37:00.000Z	hceylan		*down clocks*
2012-05-14T21:38:00.000Z	hceylan		Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-2670QM CPU @ 2.20GHz
2012-05-14T21:38:00.000Z	hceylan		is ther an echo X > /sys/xxx to disable this and set the clock speed to max?
2012-05-14T21:39:00.000Z	hceylan		Too bad!, I making smal changes and try to see the difference. But the dynamic clocking drives me nuts
2012-05-14T21:41:00.000Z	hceylan		thanks folks will try that
2012-05-14T21:42:00.000Z	hceylan		I got indicator-cpufreq installed already. But for some reason it does not work
2012-05-14T21:42:00.000Z	hceylan		it seems to set it to 'performance' /the highest clock rate). but in pratice it does not...
2012-05-14T21:42:00.000Z	wylde	hceylan	works here, I open the menu and click performance and my Processors stay at 3.2Ghz
2012-05-14T21:43:00.000Z	wylde		!dev | mafiaboy
2012-05-14T21:43:00.000Z	hceylan	wylde	in my case it shows the clock is set to highest, but profiling shows incostents times
2012-05-14T21:43:00.000Z	hceylan		that's why I think it doesn't work
2012-05-14T21:44:00.000Z	hceylan		if I do the second profiling right after the first one
2012-05-14T21:44:00.000Z	hceylan		the difference is huge
2012-05-14T21:44:00.000Z	wylde	hceylan	ahh, moment. I'll see if I have some additional lib installed.
2012-05-14T21:44:00.000Z	hceylan	wylde	my observation may make sense right?
