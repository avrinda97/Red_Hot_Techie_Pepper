2007-08-13T12:53:00.000Z	vorde		ati or nvidia?
2007-08-13T12:54:00.000Z	vorde		you'd have to look up the specs of your laptop online
2007-08-13T12:55:00.000Z	vorde		I'm still a bit of a linux n00b myself
2007-08-13T12:55:00.000Z	vorde		I've only used it for 3 weeks
2007-08-13T12:55:00.000Z	vorde		hmm...
2007-08-13T12:55:00.000Z	vorde		I would have to know the maker of the video card before being able to tell u how to install the right drivers
2007-08-13T12:56:00.000Z	vorde		try a program called "Automatix2" it will find the right drivers for it I believe
2007-08-13T12:56:00.000Z	vorde		oh
2007-08-13T12:57:00.000Z	vorde		now, can anyone help me here with zsnes?
2007-08-13T12:57:00.000Z	vorde		there u go
2007-08-13T12:58:00.000Z	phun1	vorde	what's up with znes?
2007-08-13T13:01:00.000Z	vorde	phun1	well if I try to run zsnes out of the terminal, nothing happens. when I run it in the terminal, what ends up happening is a bunch of code comes up and on the bottom it says "(core dumped)"
2007-08-13T13:09:00.000Z	phun1	vorde	I have tried over and over to replicate your error to no avail
2007-08-13T13:09:00.000Z	phun1	vorde	I would have to go through the dump to see if I could figure it out
2007-08-13T13:10:00.000Z	phun1	vorde	not sure if everyone would appreciate that
2007-08-13T13:11:00.000Z	phun1	vorde	post it to a thread on one of the forums linuquestions or ubuntu
2007-08-13T13:11:00.000Z	phun1	vorde	and I will take a look at it
2007-08-13T13:18:00.000Z	vorde	phun1	here's a link to my post
