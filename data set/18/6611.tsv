2009-01-29T05:32:00.000Z	subinacls		apt-get --remove <package && apt-get install <package>
2009-01-29T05:33:00.000Z	bort_	subinacls	does that command works too for uninstalling a video codec? (Divx)?
2009-01-29T05:34:00.000Z	subinacls		if you installed divx by the way apt-get
2009-01-29T05:34:00.000Z	subinacls		did you complie from source
2009-01-29T05:34:00.000Z	subinacls		or grab it from some package manager
2009-01-29T05:36:00.000Z	subinacls	idigital	i would go with 1 g sawp
2009-01-29T05:36:00.000Z	subinacls		swap
2009-01-29T05:36:00.000Z	bort_	subinacls	I have this green line in every divx video file I have. I think I reinstalled divx and the same problem persisted
2009-01-29T05:37:00.000Z	subinacls		i run 512 for swap
2009-01-29T05:37:00.000Z	bort_	subinacls	what else can be done?
2009-01-29T05:37:00.000Z	subinacls		also speeds depends on partitions
2009-01-29T05:37:00.000Z	subinacls		r/w head closer to center of disk <partition 1> would have better preformance then having it on part3 or so on
2009-01-29T05:39:00.000Z	bort_	subinacls	can you tell me how to uninstall the divx? maybe if vlc does not find it, it downloads it automatically
2009-01-29T05:39:00.000Z	subinacls		as for the divx
2009-01-29T05:39:00.000Z	subinacls		you can try to get another codec
2009-01-29T05:40:00.000Z	bort_		anyone??
