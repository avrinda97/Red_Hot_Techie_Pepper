2006-09-20T06:25:00.000Z	kendals		Oh, sorry, DarkMagez. Why is that?
2006-09-20T06:25:00.000Z	kendals		Is it because of 'copyright' stuff?
2006-09-20T06:25:00.000Z	kendals		Since it is the user's disgression to install what they choose. ..
2006-09-20T06:25:00.000Z	kendals		Ahh.
2006-09-20T06:25:00.000Z	kendals		Well, it's work fine for me on 3 diff. installs.
2006-09-20T06:26:00.000Z	kendals		It doesn't use the package management system- it uses the terminal and apt stuff instead.
2006-09-20T06:27:00.000Z	kendals		nope.
2006-09-20T06:27:00.000Z	kendals		Just install it, then run it, and click the stuff you want.
2006-09-20T06:27:00.000Z	kendals		and it does the rest. it's point and click stuff.
2006-09-20T06:27:00.000Z	C-O-L-T	kendals	Can I burn automatix packages to a cd in order not to download always them when you reainstall linux just install them
2006-09-20T06:28:00.000Z	C-O-L-T	kendals	sorry for interrupting you
2006-09-20T06:29:00.000Z	C-O-L-T	kendals	somebody can not just make a cd an auto-load cd which installs those stuff to your system, I would like to have something like that, not always connect to the net
2006-09-20T06:29:00.000Z	C-O-L-T	kendals	I know that it is illegal
2006-09-20T06:30:00.000Z	C-O-L-T	kendals	but people download those packages anyway so it does not matter much :D
2006-09-20T06:30:00.000Z	kendals	C-O-L-T	You could just google for files.deb stuff?
2006-09-20T06:30:00.000Z	C-O-L-T	kendals	probably
2006-09-20T06:30:00.000Z	kendals	C-O-L-T	Just grab the relevant .deb for each bit of software, then burn?
