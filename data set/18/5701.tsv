2008-09-11T07:43:00.000Z	cygoku_		Huh hello ??
2008-09-11T07:44:00.000Z	cygoku_		I have a laptop that can no longer be in 1280x800 resolution, I am stuck at 640x480
2008-09-11T07:44:00.000Z	patrickmn	cygoku_	shy do you think you are stuck at that resolution?
2008-09-11T07:45:00.000Z	patrickmn		*why
2008-09-11T07:45:00.000Z	cygoku_	patrickmn	: I don't know, I guess that's why I am here no ?
2008-09-11T07:46:00.000Z	cygoku_		...
2008-09-11T07:46:00.000Z	patrickmn	cygoku_	have you went into the system > preferences > screen resolution and tried to change it?
2008-09-11T07:47:00.000Z	cygoku_	patrickmn	: I get the same, max is 640x480 :(
2008-09-11T07:48:00.000Z	cygoku_		Wich is rly bad :(
2008-09-11T07:48:00.000Z	patrickmn	cygoku_	are you using restricted drivers?
2008-09-11T07:49:00.000Z	cygoku_	patrickmn	: Yes I am using the restricted drivers and compiz works good.
2008-09-11T07:49:00.000Z	patrickmn	cygoku_	bare with me a little, I am noob to linux, just made the switch last week
2008-09-11T07:49:00.000Z	cygoku_	patrickmn	: Okay ! :(
2008-09-11T07:50:00.000Z	patrickmn	cygoku_	I think that you may need to verify that you are using the correct driver, what kind of laptop are you using?  have you had larger resolution before?
2008-09-11T07:51:00.000Z	cygoku_	patrickmn	: I am using the correct driver I know that because I installed many times before.  I have a laptop DELL Inspiron with an ATI card and I use to have 1280x800 as default resolution
2008-09-11T07:52:00.000Z	patrickmn		i looked at the link that [STRATEGY] posted and it recommends to run the auto max display script have you looked at that page?
2008-09-11T07:54:00.000Z	patrickmn		thanks strategy, thats good to know
2008-09-11T07:56:00.000Z	patrickmn	cygoku_	you may have to go in to your xconf and view if the option for higher resolution is in there
