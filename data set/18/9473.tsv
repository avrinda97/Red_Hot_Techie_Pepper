2007-04-25T12:22:00.000Z	vladuz976		is there an iso for network install? i don't want to download 700+MB
2007-04-25T12:22:00.000Z	kahrytan	vladuz976	do it anyways. and burn more copies for neighbors.
2007-04-25T12:22:00.000Z	vladuz976	kahrytan	no time right now
2007-04-25T12:23:00.000Z	kahrytan	vladuz976	 And that's why Linux market share is still low.
2007-04-25T12:24:00.000Z	vladuz976	kahrytan	yeah if people like you keep talking it'll always be that way
2007-04-25T12:24:00.000Z	vladuz976	kahrytan	I need to get something done right now and you're telling me to convince my neighbor to change OS? does that make sense to anybody here?
2007-04-25T12:25:00.000Z	kahrytan	vladuz976	 Besides, you should do dist-upgrade if you don't want to download the cd
2007-04-25T12:26:00.000Z	vladuz976	kahrytan	dist-upgrade from what?
2007-04-25T12:26:00.000Z	vladuz976	kahrytan	who said that I already have ubuntu installed?
2007-04-25T12:26:00.000Z	kahrytan	vladuz976	then you have to download iso
2007-04-25T12:27:00.000Z	vladuz976	kahrytan	there you go, big time downside of ubuntu. forces you to install a huge iso. i know the mailing cds is great but not if you need to get work done now
2007-04-25T12:27:00.000Z	kahrytan	vladuz976	It's not any different then Windows.
2007-04-25T12:27:00.000Z	kahrytan	vladuz976	oh wait. Windows doesn't UPGRADE.
2007-04-25T12:28:00.000Z	vladuz976	kahrytan	who said I am using windows? you're drawing conclusions very fast here. but thanks, I got the info I needed
2007-04-25T12:29:00.000Z	vladuz976	kahrytan	i am using archlinux on my desktop and wanted ubuntu for my laptop
2007-04-25T12:29:00.000Z	kahrytan	vladuz976	i didnt say you were.
2007-04-25T12:30:00.000Z	kahrytan	vladuz976	I am just saying even windows needs a cd to install an OS.
2007-04-25T12:31:00.000Z	kahrytan	vladuz976	ubuntu alternative cd
