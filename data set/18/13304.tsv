2011-07-24T02:16:00.000Z	linux_noob		you mean what it caused to happen? cause i don't remember the error in terminal but it was something like could not locate even though it was there. i wouldn't want to try it again because it sometimes stopped ubuntu booting, or it would auto boot in safe graphics and if it did ever boot normally then everything gets so slow and stops responding
2011-07-24T02:18:00.000Z	linux_noob		a link to a wiki how to page?
2011-07-24T02:20:00.000Z	linux_noob		um, i confused, that page just explains what a how to page is...    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howto
2011-07-24T02:21:00.000Z	linux_noob		lol its ok
2011-07-24T02:23:00.000Z	linux_noob		yup, thats the driver that totally wrecked natty, maverick and almost lucid aswell
2011-07-24T02:24:00.000Z	linux_noob		im looking for that link that explains why its not supported...
2011-07-24T02:25:00.000Z	linux_noob		the card used to be supported, but it just doesn't work
2011-07-24T02:26:00.000Z	dli	linux_noob	which generation of card? ati seems to be fine for me
2011-07-24T02:27:00.000Z	dli	linux_noob	weird, x800 should be stable enough
2011-07-24T02:28:00.000Z	dli	linux_noob	just want to confirm, you are running the open source driver, right?
2011-07-24T02:29:00.000Z	dli	linux_noob	you may check your xorg.conf (if exists), or /var/log/Xorg.?.log
2011-07-24T02:43:00.000Z	dli	linux_noob	I think fglrx doesn't support old cards any more
2011-07-24T02:44:00.000Z	dli	linux_noob	yes, x800 is the r300 family (radeon r5xx)
2011-07-24T02:44:00.000Z	dli	linux_noob	fglrx dropped support for r5xx and older years ago
2011-07-24T02:45:00.000Z	dli	linux_noob	I don't know, I don't touch nvidia at all
2011-07-24T02:46:00.000Z	dli	linux_noob	you may try your luck with radeonhd
2011-07-24T02:47:00.000Z	dli	linux_noob	or older version of radeon
2011-07-24T02:48:00.000Z	dli	linux_noob	yes, the #radeon people was quite helping, if you report info requested, they can fix it in days
