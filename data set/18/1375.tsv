2011-03-08T11:45:00.000Z	ur2d2r		<tsyj2007> I just want my VirtualBox to use my full monitor
2011-03-08T11:46:00.000Z	AcrimoniousGoron	ur2d2r	have you installed the virtualbox additions
2011-03-08T11:47:00.000Z	AcrimoniousGoron	ur2d2r	If you have and it is working right you should be able to use seamless mode or full screen
2011-03-08T11:47:00.000Z	AcrimoniousGoron	ur2d2r	what settings are you referring to?
2011-03-08T11:50:00.000Z	AcrimoniousGoron	ur2d2r	how did you install it
2011-03-08T11:51:00.000Z	AcrimoniousGoron	ur2d2r	I've never heard of installing guest additions through a package manager.
2011-03-08T11:51:00.000Z	AcrimoniousGoron	ur2d2r	aren't you virtualizing windows? it has no package manager
2011-03-08T11:52:00.000Z	AcrimoniousGoron	ur2d2r	when you're in the virtual OS, the guest additions mounts as a CD. There is an installer on the "CD". You install that
2011-03-08T11:53:00.000Z	AcrimoniousGoron	ur2d2r	you cant install it on the host machine, like acid said. I'm not sure how to check
2011-03-08T11:53:00.000Z	AcrimoniousGoron	ur2d2r	if a cd was mounted in the virtual os and you ran the guest additions installer it should be installed
2011-03-08T11:53:00.000Z	AcrimoniousGoron	ur2d2r	all you should have to do is reboot for it to take effect
2011-03-08T11:55:00.000Z	AcrimoniousGoron	ur2d2r	I'm pretty sure if you just click on the guest additions it will mount it for you
2011-03-08T11:55:00.000Z	AcrimoniousGoron	ur2d2r	what didn't work? what exactly did it say, do, etc
2011-03-08T11:56:00.000Z	AcrimoniousGoron	ur2d2r	ok
2011-03-08T11:57:00.000Z	AcrimoniousGoron	ur2d2r	Go to the main Virtual box window.
2011-03-08T11:59:00.000Z	AcrimoniousGoron	ur2d2r	now click on settings
