2009-09-11T08:53:00.000Z	Ubuntu_Helper_00	mimiloon	There is a file called /etc/fstab which let's you do that.
2009-09-11T08:53:00.000Z	mimiloon	Ubuntu_Helper_00	thanks for the heads up
2009-09-11T08:54:00.000Z	Ubuntu_Helper_00	mimiloon	Would you like me to guide you through the steps to automatically mount your partitions and/or disk drives?
2009-09-11T08:54:00.000Z	mimiloon	Ubuntu_Helper_00	that would be nice
2009-09-11T08:55:00.000Z	Ubuntu_Helper_00	mimiloon	The format of this file is file system, mount point, type, options, dump, and pass.
2009-09-11T08:56:00.000Z	Ubuntu_Helper_00	mimiloon	What partition or disk drive are you mounting?
2009-09-11T08:57:00.000Z	mimiloon	Ubuntu_Helper_00	sda3
2009-09-11T08:58:00.000Z	Ubuntu_Helper_00	mimiloon	So you would open that file in gedit for example and you would create a new line. First, what is the file system?
2009-09-11T08:59:00.000Z	Ubuntu_Helper_00	mimiloon	Maybe you can follow example of the other automounted partitions?
2009-09-11T09:00:00.000Z	mimiloon	Ubuntu_Helper_00	it's ext3
2009-09-11T09:02:00.000Z	mimiloon	Ubuntu_Helper_00	i tried googling it but didn't understand how to do it because i'm new to linux

2009-09-11T09:04:00.000Z	mimiloon	Ubuntu_Helper_00	thanks for the link
2009-09-11T09:05:00.000Z	Ubuntu_Helper_00	mimiloon	For mount point, if you don't already know, you put the folder you want it mounted to. Make sure that this directory is already created and empty.
2009-09-11T09:06:00.000Z	mimiloon	Ubuntu_Helper_00	i'll remember that
2009-09-11T09:18:00.000Z	mimiloon	Ubuntu_Helper_00	thanks for your help
2009-09-11T09:18:00.000Z	Ubuntu_Helper_00	mimiloon	You are very much welcome. So it is working fine for you know?
