2008-07-24T09:33:00.000Z	mewshi		I use dhclient, and it works for about 30 seconds, then it cuts back again :(
2008-07-24T09:35:00.000Z	ManualOverDozer	mewshi	, i have found using staic IP is much better than DHCP. use DHCP only when you need to renew IP
2008-07-24T09:39:00.000Z	ManualOverDozer	mewshi	, have you tried a staic IP  and manually set your card ?
2008-07-24T09:44:00.000Z	ManualOverDozer	mewshi	, wireless on Ubuntu can be seemingly difficult
2008-07-24T09:44:00.000Z	ManualOverDozer	mewshi	, what is your signal strength ?
2008-07-24T09:45:00.000Z	ManualOverDozer	mewshi	signal strength is important too.
2008-07-24T09:45:00.000Z	ManualOverDozer	mewshi	sometimes the smallest things seemd to make no differene, in all actuallity, they do.
2008-07-24T09:46:00.000Z	ManualOverDozer	mewshi	, how familiar are you with Ubuntu ?
2008-07-24T09:47:00.000Z	ManualOverDozer	mewshi	just as alsrth said, simple things may make all the difference, like cell phones, cordless devices, and antyhing that can effect the 2.4ghz band
2008-07-24T09:47:00.000Z	ManualOverDozer	mewshi	, have you tried staic IP with manual settings ?
2008-07-24T09:52:00.000Z	ManualOverDozer	mewshi	's  card bcm4138
2008-07-24T09:54:00.000Z	ManualOverDozer	mewshi	i can understand, it used to do the same thing to me
2008-07-24T09:54:00.000Z	ManualOverDozer	mewshi	staic IP and manual settings
2008-07-24T09:57:00.000Z	ManualOverDozer	mewshi	if you need help, you first must accept it
2008-07-24T09:57:00.000Z	ManualOverDozer	mewshi	you will have to have someone else help you
2008-07-24T10:01:00.000Z	ManualOverDozer	mewshi	, i had been in the same shoes as you, so dont think noone has gone through it
2008-07-24T10:02:00.000Z	ManualOverDozer	mewshi	, and i will admit, it was Ultra_Frustrating, just so you know, youre not the only one
