2012-01-24T08:11:00.000Z	dies_irae		how about waiting a lil for more?
2012-01-24T08:13:00.000Z	dies_irae		after this last firefox OOM my sound is gone but Left/Right test do work
2012-01-24T08:13:00.000Z	dies_irae		what happened?
2012-01-24T08:14:00.000Z	dies_irae		all the cards are gone from systems settings, you know where you move up and down.
2012-01-24T08:14:00.000Z	dies_irae		only remains pulse
2012-01-24T08:14:00.000Z	dies_irae		how to fix this?
2012-01-24T08:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dies_irae	try:  kilall pulseaudio; rm -r ~/.pulse*
2012-01-24T08:16:00.000Z	dies_irae	ActionParsnip	w00t
2012-01-24T08:16:00.000Z	dies_irae	ActionParsnip	actually your first command failed but sound is back with only second command oO
2012-01-24T08:18:00.000Z	dies_irae	ActionParsnip	now there are way too many devices :/
2012-01-24T08:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dies_irae	That defaults your sound options to default
2012-01-24T08:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dies_irae	its a really good first move for sound
2012-01-24T08:26:00.000Z	dies_irae	ActionParsnip	fixed, thanks

2012-02-08T05:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dies_irae	if you run PPC or ARM cpu you will need it (or another alternative)
2012-02-09T22:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dies_irae	try:   killall pulseaudio; rm -r ~/.pulse*    wait a few seconds then retry sound
