2011-05-01T17:11:00.000Z	nukem		i am looking for linux distro that asks for root password during  installation
2011-05-01T17:12:00.000Z	nukem		why doesn't ubuntu ask for root password during ubuntu installation
2011-05-01T17:14:00.000Z	nukem		dr_willis i don't like distro that disables root
2011-05-01T17:14:00.000Z	nukem		drwillis what is the diffrence between lockeddown and disabled
2011-05-01T17:15:00.000Z	nukem		dr_willis   i cannot directly login as root:  is this ubuntu-only thing?
2011-05-01T17:16:00.000Z	nukem		i refuse to use ubuntu for this reason then
2011-05-01T17:16:00.000Z	nukem		coz can i log in as root  after setting root password
2011-05-01T17:16:00.000Z	nukem		then why did drwill said no i cannot

2011-05-01T17:17:00.000Z	nukem	ikonia	 what do you mean i don't know these things: i know how to use root
2011-05-01T17:17:00.000Z	ikonia	nukem	yet you don't know that you need to set a password to login as root
2011-05-01T17:18:00.000Z	nukem	ikonia	 because it's usually asked during  installation
2011-05-01T17:18:00.000Z	ikonia	nukem	the sudo model is quite basic and effective
2011-05-01T17:18:00.000Z	nukem	ikonia	i hate sudo model with a passion
2011-05-01T17:18:00.000Z	ikonia	nukem	yet you don't understand it.....hence you'd know to set a root password
2011-05-01T17:26:00.000Z	ikonia	nukem	there isn't one
2011-05-01T17:26:00.000Z	ikonia	nukem	they all use the sudo security model
2011-05-01T17:27:00.000Z	ikonia	nukem	don't use ubuntu then, thanks
