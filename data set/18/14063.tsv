2009-10-07T19:36:00.000Z	jbwiv		hi guys. As a best practice, is it necessary or recommended to move all private files in the home directory (.gconf, .gconfd, etc) when upgrading ubuntu or migrating /home to a new install? I would be concerned that upgrades to Gnome and other apps might cause the configs stored in these private dirs to break things....
2009-10-07T19:37:00.000Z	jbwiv		guys, I'm not interested in replicating my package selection necessarily, and I always to backups. What I'm more interested in conflicts old config files can cause when doing upgrades. I'm preparing to upgrade Jaunty to Karmic through apt
2009-10-07T19:37:00.000Z	jbwiv		wondering if I should move the . files out of the way
2009-10-07T19:38:00.000Z	sipior	jbwiv	can't hurt, really.
2009-10-07T19:38:00.000Z	jbwiv	sipior	can't hurt to move them? can it hurt to leave them?
2009-10-07T19:38:00.000Z	sipior	jbwiv	to move them.
2009-10-07T19:38:00.000Z	jbwiv	sipior	ok
2009-10-07T19:40:00.000Z	sipior	jbwiv	i've never ad a problem with these things on an update. moving /home to another install altogether might cause problems.
2010-04-07T22:31:00.000Z	sipior	jbwiv	nothing dumped to logs?
2010-04-07T22:32:00.000Z	jbwiv	sipior	nothing noticeable. which log? messages? syslog? dmesg?
2010-04-07T22:33:00.000Z	sipior	jbwiv	well, i was thinking syslog in and kern.log in particular. are you doing similar things when the crashes occur?
2010-04-07T22:34:00.000Z	jbwiv	sipior	no, completely random
2010-04-07T22:41:00.000Z	jbwiv	sipior	what's the first thing written to kern.log on reboot? I'm trying to find what the last message was before reboot
2010-04-07T22:43:00.000Z	sipior	jbwiv	all the entries are timestamped, aren't they?
2010-04-07T22:44:00.000Z	jbwiv	sipior	true, and nothing sticks out there
2010-04-07T22:49:00.000Z	jbwiv	sipior	nothing in syslog either, except some "wpa_supplicant[1801]: CTRL-EVENT-SCAN-RESULTS" entries
2010-04-28T19:29:00.000Z	sipior	jbwiv	anything interesting get dumped in the system logs that corresponds to the time of the crashes?
2010-04-28T19:33:00.000Z	jbwiv	sipior	no, nothing of note
