2012-01-27T09:49:00.000Z	djcobra		hi guys... just wondering if anyone could be kind enough to help me with telnet or ssh
2012-01-27T09:50:00.000Z	djcobra		i can't seem to login to ubuntu machine from work
2012-01-27T09:50:00.000Z	randomuser`	djcobra	try ssh -vvv
2012-01-27T09:51:00.000Z	djcobra	randomuser`	what do you mean?
2012-01-27T09:51:00.000Z	randomuser`	djcobra	type 'ssh -vvv $HOSTNAME'
2012-01-27T09:53:00.000Z	djcobra	randomuser`	okay i did that, just typed in yes a few times
2012-01-27T09:54:00.000Z	randomuser`	djcobra	did you learn anything from it?
2012-01-27T09:56:00.000Z	randomuser`	djcobra	what exact command are you typing?
2012-01-27T09:58:00.000Z	randomuser`	djcobra	and its definately the IP of your home, and not a reserved IP? (ie 192....)
2012-01-27T09:59:00.000Z	randomuser`	djcobra	if you are not at home, you cannot possibly expect your lan IP to work
2012-01-27T10:01:00.000Z	randomuser`	djcobra	if your valid ISP IP address doesn't work, you have at least one of several problems: bad port forward, sshd is not listening, firewall has closed the port, ISP is blocking the port
2012-01-27T10:02:00.000Z	randomuser`	djcobra	you have my permission
2012-01-27T10:04:00.000Z	randomuser`	djcobra	do you have access to the target box right now?
2012-01-27T10:06:00.000Z	randomuser`	djcobra	iptables -L shows your firewall rules
2012-01-27T10:07:00.000Z	djcobra	randomuser`	command doesn't work
2012-01-27T10:10:00.000Z	randomuser`	djcobra	i suspect your ports are not correctly forwarded, on a hunch
2012-01-27T10:10:00.000Z	djcobra	randomuser`	i ahve input forward and output policy
2012-01-27T10:12:00.000Z	randomuser`	djcobra	PM?
