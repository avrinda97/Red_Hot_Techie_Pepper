2008-07-05T07:39:00.000Z	bullgard4		My dmesg start with " Initializing cgroup subsys cpuset". What is meant by 'cgroup'?
2008-07-05T07:40:00.000Z	crimsun	bullgard4	control group.
2008-07-05T07:40:00.000Z	bullgard4	crimsun	Thank you.
2008-08-10T10:35:00.000Z	crimsun	bullgard4	it means tcp in IPv6
2008-08-10T10:37:00.000Z	bullgard4	crimsun	This is then the first time that I am aware that my Ubuntu uses IPv6. (I managed this morning for the first time to transfer a file using ssh.) Is it normal that Ubuntu uses IPv6 for ssh but almost not otherwise?
2008-08-10T10:38:00.000Z	bullgard4	crimsun	s/otherwise/elsewhere
2008-08-10T10:40:00.000Z	crimsun	bullgard4	it doesn't "use" IPv6 for anything else it's supported throughout the entire network route
2008-08-10T10:41:00.000Z	crimsun	bullgard4	so, chances are, it's not used at all unless you've explicitly configured your internal network as such.
2008-08-10T10:48:00.000Z	bullgard4	crimsun	I did not do anything else than to install Ubuntu 8.04's DEB program packages and did not tune them by hand. So I suppose that Ubuntu 8.04 first tries as a default IPv6 and only if this is not supported (somewhere) then Ubuntu 8.04 will use  TCP IPv4.
2008-08-10T10:49:00.000Z	crimsun	bullgard4	that's the behaviour of apps that are dualstacked.
2008-08-10T10:50:00.000Z	bullgard4	crimsun	Please tell me what applications are dualstacked and what applications are not?
2008-08-10T11:00:00.000Z	crimsun	bullgard4	not without static or runtime analysis
2008-08-10T11:02:00.000Z	bullgard4	crimsun	Ok. Thank you.
2008-10-24T09:38:00.000Z	crimsun	bullgard4	"terminal output"
2008-10-24T09:38:00.000Z	bullgard4	crimsun	Ah! Thank you.
2010-10-11T09:33:00.000Z	crimsun	bullgard4	I'm pretty sure you want to see the other man pages, e.g., trackerd, tracker-applet
2010-10-11T09:34:00.000Z	bullgard4	crimsun	Ah! Thank you very much for your help.
