2009-11-08T05:44:00.000Z	hedkandi		folks, how do I set the brightness of my screen with ubuntu?
2009-11-08T05:44:00.000Z	hedkandi		I'd expect it to be under system - display but I can't find it
2009-11-08T05:45:00.000Z	hedkandi		yes
2009-11-08T05:46:00.000Z	Billiard	hedkandi	i know of commands to set the brightness, but i think its in the power settings as well
2009-11-08T05:47:00.000Z	hedkandi	Billiard	so what commands do the job then?
2009-11-08T05:53:00.000Z	Billiard	hedkandi	to set the screen brightness time, you can use gconf-editor
2009-11-08T05:54:00.000Z	Billiard	hedkandi	sorry not at a ubuntu machine at the moment, but it is under power management or something, it is with all the other power settings but not on the gui power management settings window
2009-11-08T05:55:00.000Z	hedkandi	Billiard	am I right in thinking gconf is the ubuntu version of the registry?
2009-11-08T05:55:00.000Z	Billiard	hedkandi	not really no, it only is a gui for changing the settings in the .gnome directory
2009-11-08T05:56:00.000Z	hedkandi	Billiard	other things can and do use gconf to maintain persistent data
2009-11-08T05:56:00.000Z	hedkandi	Billiard	it's not gnome-specific
2009-11-08T05:56:00.000Z	Billiard	hedkandi	they just put their settings in .gnome i believe, because they are ment for use with gnome
2009-11-08T05:58:00.000Z	Billiard	hedkandi	you can get the source using apt-get source, why?
2009-11-24T06:46:00.000Z	Billiard	hedkandi	ubuntu doesnt have one by default afaik
2009-11-24T06:48:00.000Z	Billiard	hedkandi	how are you looking
2009-11-24T06:50:00.000Z	Billiard	hedkandi	if your cd is your home and you dont see it, you dont have a .profile
2009-11-24T06:50:00.000Z	Billiard	hedkandi	copy it from /etc/skel  if you want the default
