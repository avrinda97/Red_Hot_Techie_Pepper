2010-07-09T03:46:00.000Z	thune3	matyd	are you affected by https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Bugs/Lucidi8xxFreezes , you can run "lspci | grep VGA" to see if you have 8xx series graphics

To get arond this (for a very short time, since it keeps doing this) i just reboot and that works for a litte bit.

2010-07-09T04:13:00.000Z	thune3	matyd	i believe you are affected by https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Bugs/Lucidi8xxFreezes . the instructions under the section "Potential Solution: PPA packages" probably have your solution.
2010-07-09T04:14:00.000Z	thune3	matyd	sorry that fix is only for 855gm chip

2010-07-09T04:15:00.000Z	thune3	matyd	workaround A might do the trick for you.
2010-07-09T04:15:00.000Z	matyd		okay thank you thune3
2010-07-09T04:16:00.000Z	matyd		reading up on it now
2010-07-09T04:19:00.000Z	matyd	thune3	these workarounds are if your can't boot into GUI correct?
2010-07-09T04:19:00.000Z	matyd		so would i fall under the same bug?
2010-07-09T04:22:00.000Z	thune3	matyd	the screen going irreversibly black qualifies as a lockup. You can hit shift on boot and add "i915.modeset=1" after "quiet splash" to the grub line. If this fixes your problem then you can make this permanent using the commands in the yellow box of 'Workaround A'
