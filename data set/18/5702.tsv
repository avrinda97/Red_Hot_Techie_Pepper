2009-04-07T17:13:00.000Z	aar	ActionParsnip	thanks
2009-04-09T17:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aar	share a folder in windows, smb://<server name>/<share name>
2009-04-09T17:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aar	then copy and paste
2009-04-09T17:16:00.000Z	aar	ActionParsnip	there is no real server though, it's just a couple of boxes connected to the router
2009-04-09T17:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aar	if it has a netbios name you are ok, the folder must be shared (or if its windows, the drives are shared with $ (hidden shares) and can be accessed with local admin password)
2009-04-09T17:17:00.000Z	aar	ActionParsnip	ok thanks
2010-05-18T17:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aar	compiz is a window manager
2010-05-18T17:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aar	it replaces kde's default which is kwin
2010-05-18T17:01:00.000Z	aar	ActionParsnip	why are my compiz settings (set through compizconfig) apparently ignored?
2010-05-18T17:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aar	kde is a desktop environment: (k) (d)esktop (e)nvironment
2010-05-18T17:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aar	run:   compiz --replace    in a konsole, see if it actually runs
2010-05-18T17:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aar	if not then you may need to reinstall the video driver as it may not have survived the upgrade  process
2010-05-18T17:03:00.000Z	aar	ActionParsnip	it has changed to a different windows manager (less flashy -- I suppose this is not compiz now)
2010-05-18T17:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aar	no, compiz --replace     makes compiz run
2010-05-18T17:04:00.000Z	aar	ActionParsnip	there's some conflict in the configuration. I'll try to figure it out.
2011-03-23T23:20:00.000Z	aar	ActionParsnip	what does ia32-libs do?
2011-03-23T23:22:00.000Z	aar	ActionParsnip	thanks
