2007-12-28T22:20:00.000Z	vasilisa		i just did something stupid. My cd roms arent mountiing correctly because i deleted the mount points under /media that looked like files and tries to replace them with folders to mount to, so it would look cleaner.... now its saying stuff like it cant read the dvd because i might not have permission, and K3b cant even mount it .
2007-12-28T22:20:00.000Z	vasilisa		any help would be appreciated.

2007-12-28T22:28:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	vasilisa	How about deleting the mount points you created and trying to manually remount them
2007-12-28T22:28:00.000Z	vasilisa	Jack_Sparrow	They're deleted. They auto mount nto my desktop o.O
