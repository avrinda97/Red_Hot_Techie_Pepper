2004-10-27T10:52:00.000Z	baHam		hey
2004-10-27T10:52:00.000Z	baHam		how do I kill an app from his PID ?
2004-10-27T10:53:00.000Z	jdub	baHam	kill PID
2004-10-27T10:54:00.000Z	jdub	baHam	ps afx
2004-10-28T09:02:00.000Z	jdub	baHam	configure xmms to use esd output
2004-10-31T10:25:00.000Z	jdub	baHam	no.
2004-10-31T10:25:00.000Z	baHam	jdub	there is no way or what?
2004-10-31T10:26:00.000Z	jdub	baHam	we've made it so icons don't appear on the desktop. you've got the computer menu and trash applet on the panel to replace them. this is much more useful.
2004-10-31T10:27:00.000Z	baHam	jdub	so, there is NO way to get them ON the desktop ?
2004-10-31T10:28:00.000Z	jdub	baHam	if, for some reason, you can't evolve yourself out of the icons-on-the-desktop mess
2004-10-31T10:28:00.000Z	jdub	baHam	you can change some settings in gconf to bring back the special icons (computer, trash, home, etc)
2004-11-01T10:06:00.000Z	baHam	jdub	sorry :) 
2004-11-01T10:06:00.000Z	baHam	jdub	can I pm you, please?
2004-11-01T10:08:00.000Z	baHam	jdub	where can I find Dafydd from the Translations team ?
2004-11-01T10:09:00.000Z	jdub	baHam	daf == dafydd, who does indeed come from wales
2004-11-01T10:10:00.000Z	baHam	jdub	I need to talk to him.. is he usually on IRC?
2004-11-01T10:10:00.000Z	jdub	baHam	daf is on channel.
2004-11-01T10:11:00.000Z	baHam	jdub	sorry.. didnt see him.. I'm tired :|
