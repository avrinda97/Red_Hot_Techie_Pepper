2006-08-12T10:24:00.000Z	sethk	carpediem	why?
2006-08-12T10:24:00.000Z	sethk	carpediem	I can't see any situation consistent with the data where that might help
2006-08-12T10:24:00.000Z	carpediem	sethk	if he's not resolving a host
2006-08-12T10:25:00.000Z	sethk	carpediem	setting the name servers to what the name servers are already set to will not fix that
2006-08-12T10:25:00.000Z	sethk	carpediem	and it is resolving.  we proved that with dig
2006-08-12T10:25:00.000Z	carpediem	sethk	sorry, missed that bit.
2006-08-12T10:25:00.000Z	sethk	carpediem	ok
2006-08-12T10:25:00.000Z	sethk	carpediem	this is very strange.  dig works, but names don't resolve in the browser.
2006-08-12T10:26:00.000Z	carpediem	sethk	can he ping an IP?
2006-08-12T10:26:00.000Z	sethk	carpediem	he can ping by ip, and he can browse by ip
2006-08-12T10:26:00.000Z	sethk	carpediem	and dig resolves, and his resolv.conf is correct
2006-08-12T10:27:00.000Z	carpediem	sethk	ctkt05: sorry, but are we sure we've got DNS set?
2006-08-12T10:27:00.000Z	sethk	carpediem	yes.  the only way dig can work is if dns is set correctly
2006-08-12T10:28:00.000Z	sethk	carpediem	dig is just a dns lookup utility
2006-08-12T10:36:00.000Z	carpediem	sethk	not real familiar with dig, I just know that's what I do when I have his problem, and it usually works.
2006-08-12T10:37:00.000Z	sethk	carpediem	unless he isn't configured properly, and a different dhclient command is run at boot
2006-08-12T10:37:00.000Z	sethk	carpediem	but even if that were true, once /etc/resolv.conf is correct, dns is not going to change.
2006-08-12T10:37:00.000Z	carpediem	sethk	or not at all (no "iface eth0 inet dhcp" line in interfaces)
