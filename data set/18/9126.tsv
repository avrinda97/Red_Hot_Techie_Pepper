2007-08-14T08:50:00.000Z	godzirra		Sigh.  My laptop is back to booting to a blank screen.  Ubuntu's rapidly becoming more trouble than its worth. :/
2007-08-14T08:51:00.000Z	godzirra		All I did was install new alsa drivers, and now my laptop boots to a blank screen.  Is there a way to get it to boot in text mode so I can see whqats going on?
2007-08-14T08:51:00.000Z	mayorbuttes	godzirra	When yo boot up, chose revocery console
2007-08-14T08:52:00.000Z	godzirra	mayorbuttes	I didnt even know there's a recovery console from grub.
2007-08-14T08:52:00.000Z	mayorbuttes	godzirra	There should be.. hm. Try just when it boots the the blank screen hitting ctrl+alt+1
2007-08-14T08:53:00.000Z	mayorbuttes	godzirra	Hehehe
2007-08-14T08:53:00.000Z	mayorbuttes	godzirra	Did you happen to remove your old version of alsa first?
2007-08-14T08:54:00.000Z	mayorbuttes	godzirra	I see. Well sometimes, you get conflicts with stuff being installed twice.
2007-08-14T08:54:00.000Z	mayorbuttes	godzirra	Your problem is new to me, so it's only a guess
2007-08-14T08:55:00.000Z	mayorbuttes	godzirra	But try modprobbing alsa
2007-08-14T08:55:00.000Z	mayorbuttes	godzirra	and see if multiple instances come up
2007-08-14T08:56:00.000Z	mayorbuttes	godzirra	hm. boot to the recovery console again
2007-08-14T08:56:00.000Z	godzirra	mayorbuttes	the system seems to work fine.  When I hit the powert button once, it shuts the system down correctly.
2007-08-14T08:56:00.000Z	mayorbuttes	godzirra	odd.
2007-08-14T08:56:00.000Z	mayorbuttes	godzirra	I would say first, though to modprob alsa
2007-08-14T08:56:00.000Z	mayorbuttes	godzirra	and see what you geett
2007-08-14T08:58:00.000Z	godzirra	mayorbuttes	FATAL: Module alsa not found.
2007-08-14T08:58:00.000Z	mayorbuttes	godzirra	Hm. well you obviously didn't do something right :P
