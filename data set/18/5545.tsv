2009-03-12T21:28:00.000Z	dronix	bretticus	what kind of gfx card do u have?
2009-03-12T21:28:00.000Z	bretticus		ati x600
2009-03-12T21:28:00.000Z	bretticus		flgrx
2009-03-12T21:30:00.000Z	bretticus	dronix	usually I just use my laptop, but today it's hooked up to an external monotor via VGA and I can't sem to figure out how to get a 1280x1024 resolution (the native res or the monitor)
2009-03-12T21:31:00.000Z	dronix	bretticus	I think you'll need the ati catalys control center, it'll give u all the resolutions supported by your external monitor
2009-03-12T21:31:00.000Z	bretticus		I have it, but it doesn't seem to either detect my monitor or it just doesn't have that option
2009-03-12T21:32:00.000Z	bretticus	dronix	just says "analog monitor"
2009-03-12T21:32:00.000Z	dronix	bretticus	is it a computer monitor or someting else?
2009-03-12T21:33:00.000Z	bretticus	dronix	it's a computer monitor
2009-03-12T21:33:00.000Z	bretticus	dronix	a Envision EN9110 to be exact
2009-03-12T21:33:00.000Z	dronix	bretticus	and I'm guessing you've been able to use that resolution on that monitor before, correct?
2009-03-12T21:34:00.000Z	bretticus	dronix	yes, in windows it works fine
2009-03-12T21:34:00.000Z	bretticus	dronix	well, it has that mode
2009-03-12T21:35:00.000Z	bretticus	dronix	specs say "1,280 x 1,024 resolution, 0.294 mm dot pitch"
2009-03-12T21:36:00.000Z	bretticus	dronix	reconfiguring x just doesn't give me that mode
2009-03-12T21:37:00.000Z	bretticus	dronix	I have tried to use a mode line under screen for that res, but then x crashes.
2009-03-12T21:42:00.000Z	dronix	bretticus	I think you're gonna have to modify your xorg.conf
