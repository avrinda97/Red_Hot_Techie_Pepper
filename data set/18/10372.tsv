2006-12-10T16:56:00.000Z	Elglas		random question, why do my sound cards alternate between dsp and dsp1?
2006-12-10T16:56:00.000Z	crimsun	Elglas	they don't alternate randomly, if that's what you're asking.
2006-12-10T16:57:00.000Z	Elglas		ah but they do, sometimes by pci card is dsp, other times dsp1 swapping with my onboard, no hardware changes
2006-12-10T16:57:00.000Z	crimsun	Elglas	you mean pci device enumeration, then, and not "dsp and dsp1 alternating randomly"
2006-12-10T16:58:00.000Z	crimsun	Elglas	you can fix a certain ordering if you wish.  ``asoundconf list''
2006-12-10T17:02:00.000Z	crimsun	Elglas	I'm awaiting that output...
2006-12-10T17:05:00.000Z	Elglas		elglas@mozart:~$ asoundconf list
2006-12-10T17:05:00.000Z	Elglas		Names of available sound cards:
2006-12-10T17:05:00.000Z	Elglas		V8237
2006-12-10T17:05:00.000Z	Elglas		M1010
2006-12-10T17:06:00.000Z	Elglas		envy is the bomb
2006-12-10T17:06:00.000Z	crimsun	Elglas	and which do you always want to be card 0 (the default w/o asoundrc)?
2006-12-10T17:06:00.000Z	Elglas		teh delta 1010 (m1010)
2006-12-10T17:07:00.000Z	crimsun	Elglas	echo options snd-via82xx index=-2 | sudo tee -a /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base
2006-12-10T17:08:00.000Z	Elglas	crimsun	options snd-via82xx index=-2
2006-12-10T17:09:00.000Z	crimsun	Elglas	it takes effect on next module insertion.
2006-12-10T17:09:00.000Z	Elglas	crimsun	so essentially on restart
2006-12-10T17:10:00.000Z	Elglas	crimsun	thank you very much, I'll post this on forums
