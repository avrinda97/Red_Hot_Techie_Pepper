2008-09-20T22:44:00.000Z	csilk	Flannel	 uname -a will only create one line of output, why cant he just paste it here?
2008-09-20T22:44:00.000Z	Flannel	csilk	I had intended to say paste.  I guess my fingers are just doing whatever they want.
2008-09-20T22:45:00.000Z	csilk	Flannel	 pastebin is just a default reponse for most people that have experienced stupid people trying to paste things like there x config file into irc haha
2008-10-23T05:55:00.000Z	Flannel	csilk	enough
2008-10-27T05:50:00.000Z	csilk	Flannel	he'll probs go back to app when ge realises he needs several dependencies :)
2008-11-16T07:05:00.000Z	csilk	Flannel	thanks for telling me where my home folder is, Without that info I would of surely lost my Uni research
2008-11-16T07:07:00.000Z	Flannel	csilk	That's not quite the point of that factoid.  And please lose the attitude
2008-11-23T04:39:00.000Z	Flannel	csilk	How did you install OOo3?
2008-11-23T04:39:00.000Z	csilk	Flannel	adding launchpad PPA that some OOo devs setup
2008-11-23T04:40:00.000Z	Flannel	csilk	Alright, first: remove the PPA from your sources, then remove everything you got from that PPA, then reinstall OOo
2008-11-23T04:40:00.000Z	csilk	Flannel	done, keep getting errors from synaptic when i try to re-install saying something like: openoffice.org-core-xxx depends on openoffice.org-writer but writer will not be installed
2008-11-23T04:41:00.000Z	Flannel	csilk	sudo apt-get update after you remove them from your sources.
2008-11-23T04:41:00.000Z	Flannel	csilk	If theres further issues, be sure you didn't forget to remove something (completely, via purge, or "complete removal" in synaptic)
2008-11-23T04:42:00.000Z	csilk	Flannel	same problem, I'm going to double check everything is removed
2008-11-23T04:42:00.000Z	Flannel	csilk	If you still have the issue, let me know, we can look into specifics.
2008-11-23T04:43:00.000Z	csilk	Flannel	thanks, I'm making sure/ double checking all packages are purged
2008-11-23T04:45:00.000Z	csilk	Flannel	looks there was a language pack from the ppa that I missed
2008-11-23T04:53:00.000Z	csilk	Flannel	thanks for the prompt to check if all packages were removed, sorted it and know OOo is working normally :)
