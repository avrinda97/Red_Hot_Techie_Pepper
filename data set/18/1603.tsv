2011-01-14T15:33:00.000Z	HugoGF		My sound jack isn't putting sound through my headphones, it just comes out of the computer's speakers. Could someone help me please?
2011-01-14T15:34:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	HugoGF	that's the exact opposite for me.
2011-01-14T15:35:00.000Z	HugoGF	q_a_z_steve	I've already messed around with my sound preferences but that doesn't seem to do it.
2011-01-14T15:36:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	HugoGF	try those links
2011-01-14T15:36:00.000Z	HugoGF	q_a_z_steve	It's the output through my headphones that isn't working, and I don't know where to find the drivers.. I've tried those links. Also, my input sound doesn't work.
2011-01-14T15:37:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	HugoGF	what hardware? Typing fail.
2011-01-14T15:38:00.000Z	HugoGF	q_a_z_steve	My computers speakers? In a console command that I entered before( I can't remember what it was) it said that they were connexant
2011-01-14T15:39:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	HugoGF	aplay probably
2011-01-14T15:40:00.000Z	HugoGF	q_a_z_steve	So what should I do about it?
2011-01-14T15:42:00.000Z	HugoGF	q_a_z_steve	So what should I do about my speakers? I really need to be able to use my headphones.
2011-01-14T15:43:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	HugoGF	see my comments from 03:40:50
2011-01-14T15:44:00.000Z	HugoGF	q_a_z_steve	I don't have any time increments next to what anyone says..
2011-01-14T15:46:00.000Z	HugoGF	q_a_z_steve	I see, could you please tell me how I can use OSS?
2011-01-14T15:46:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	HugoGF	Haven't gotten there yet friend. google?
2011-01-14T15:52:00.000Z	HugoGF	q_a_z_steve	okay, I installed OSS but the same thing happens.
2011-01-14T15:52:00.000Z	HugoGF	q_a_z_steve	My speakers work, but when the headphones get plugged in the sound still goes through the computer.
2011-01-14T15:54:00.000Z	q_a_z_steve	HugoGF	You said you've messed with the different profiles and that, have you done that since OSS also?
2011-01-14T15:57:00.000Z	HugoGF	q_a_z_steve	Yes, I have messed around the preferences, nothing works. But I may have found something about it.
