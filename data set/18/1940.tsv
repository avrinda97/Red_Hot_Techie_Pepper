2011-07-03T22:55:00.000Z	amarcolino		Hi, I want to setup user accounts and authentication via the network so it doesn't matter machines are used, users will be able to login and and gain access to their own area found on another machine. However, I would like to know how would I go about achieving this, I am currently researching ldap and maybe nfs, can someone suggest a more applicable approach? Am I on the right track?
2011-07-03T22:55:00.000Z	pfifo	amarcolino	Netboot with NFS seems to be what your looking for
2011-07-03T23:02:00.000Z	amarcolino	pfifo	just did a quick search on netboot seems achievable however does it apply when the clients have ubuntu already install? If not, would ldap and nfs work?
2011-07-03T23:04:00.000Z	pfifo	amarcolino	firs off, i have no clue about LDAP, never used it. But as for NFS, yes there is a kernel line option to mount a NFS share as the root, you could skip netbooting if you actually put grub and a kernel on the machines, but Netboot with PXELinux is pretty simple to setup and easire to maintain

2011-07-03T23:06:00.000Z	pfifo	amarcolino	ah, not need for LDAP with NFS, normal PAM will use /etc/passwd from the NFS
2011-07-03T23:08:00.000Z	amarcolino	pfifo	pam can authenticate users on the server to the clients?
2011-07-03T23:09:00.000Z	pfifo	amarcolino	no, it cant
2011-07-03T23:09:00.000Z	pfifo	amarcolino	but since the same /etc/passwd will be on both the server and clients, all the uses will be the same
2011-07-03T23:12:00.000Z	amarcolino	pfifo	ok, that is what I thought you just told me on your last post, I am trying to avoid a situation where I need to add users to the other clients via ssh, I've found a few options including yours, which is more appropriable is what I need to find out specially if in six months or sooner I have to keep adding users
2011-07-03T23:13:00.000Z	amarcolino	pfifo	I wont disturb you any longer will attempt the option I think is more appropriate at this time, thanks
2011-07-03T23:14:00.000Z	pfifo	amarcolino	all of the clients will have the exact same files, and since user info is stored in a file, all the clients will have the same user info. Does that make sense? A password change for one user on one machine will modify the file, and it will effect all the other machines as well
2011-07-03T23:24:00.000Z	amarcolino	pfifo	I understand that, what I don't understand is which application will keep track of the changes or make the changes to other clients. You mentioned nfs, but from my understanding it only creates the directory/user space but doesn't add any security (unless I am mistaken), at the same time if a user's account gets locked or deleted I would have like the system to update itself. In the long run having a way to manage user authentication and user s
2011-07-03T23:27:00.000Z	pfifo	amarcolino	they will all have the same filesystem, a change on one will be reflected on the others, you really have to try it i guess
2011-07-03T23:32:00.000Z	amarcolino	pfifo	thanks for being patient, I will look into what you said and hopefully get my head around it as I believe the only way to get the same exact files is through rsync...
2011-07-03T23:46:00.000Z	amarcolino	pfifo	sorry to disturb just wanted to share this link which I believe is what you were trying to explain and achieves what I want, http://abhishekdelta.wordpress.com/2010/08/15/quickly-configuring-an-ldap-nfs-client-in-fedora/, 'NFS assured that no matter in which of those 6 machines the user logs in, he will always see the same files in his home directory and same..."
2011-07-03T23:49:00.000Z	pfifo	amarcolino	read this more closely "4) An NFS server ( IP : 10.0.0.126 ) which has the user home-directories of all users inside /webteam folder." im talking about making more than just /home a NFS, im saying to make all of / NFS, LDAP would not be needed in this case
