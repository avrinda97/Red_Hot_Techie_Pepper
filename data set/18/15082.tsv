2005-06-17T06:07:00.000Z	p0m		Ok, next stupid question. Anyone know how I get rid of the system beep when modprobe tries to load blacklisted modules?
2005-06-17T06:09:00.000Z	p0m		There's a few modules that used to not be able to be loaded in Warty, it seems they're blacklisted now.
2005-06-17T06:10:00.000Z	p0m		Remember to upgrade kernel when you upgrade the system, as apt won't.
2005-06-17T06:10:00.000Z	p0m		Ndiswrapper causes issues with my keyboard on my box.
2005-06-17T06:10:00.000Z	p0m		I get random repeats of characters.
2005-06-17T06:11:00.000Z	p0m		Ugh.
2005-06-17T06:12:00.000Z	p0m		Note to anyone here, make sure you change your cron when you install Tiger.
2005-06-17T06:12:00.000Z	p0m		I've got like 200 mail messages from Tiger, one every two hours for the last week.
2005-06-17T06:12:00.000Z	p0m		And mail doesn't support mass delete
2005-06-17T06:13:00.000Z	p0m		Ohh echo, how I love you.
2005-06-17T06:13:00.000Z	cthulfuego	p0m	Tiger isn't mailing anyone via cron, here.
2005-06-17T06:13:00.000Z	p0m		sudo echo "" /var/mail/p0m
2005-06-17T06:13:00.000Z	p0m		sudo echo "" > /var/mail/p0m
2005-06-17T06:14:00.000Z	p0m		Rather.
2005-06-17T06:14:00.000Z	cthulfuego	p0m	No, > drops privs. And you can write to your own mail file ANWYAY.
2005-06-17T06:14:00.000Z	p0m	cthulfuego	Good point.
2005-06-17T06:14:00.000Z	p0m		I'm just in the habit of sudoing when I write to anywhere but home.
2005-06-17T06:14:00.000Z	cthulfuego	p0m	cat /dev/null > /var/mail/$LOGNAME
