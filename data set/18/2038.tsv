2010-09-03T13:37:00.000Z	thune3	sisterd	what graphics chip are you running? "lspci | grep VGA"
2010-09-03T13:40:00.000Z	sisterd	thune3	I'm not sure, I think the Dimension graphics are integrated, aka when i read the configuration as shipped it doesn't specify anything separate for the chip
2010-09-03T13:40:00.000Z	sisterd	thune3	the ubuntu prefs show its using a generic compaq driver... VGA
2010-09-03T13:41:00.000Z	thune3	sisterd	if you're on the machine, it would help if you ran "lspci | grep VGA" and copy/past the line here
2010-09-03T13:41:00.000Z	sisterd		ok. noob here. how do i open up a command line to do that?
2010-09-03T13:42:00.000Z	sisterd		thanks jb
2010-09-03T13:43:00.000Z	sisterd		thun3: it says: 00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation 82845G/GL[Brookdale-G]/GE Chipset Integrated Graphics Device (rev 01)
2010-09-03T13:49:00.000Z	sisterd	thune3	typed your name wrong before, perhaps you missed it? the grep replied: 00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation 82845G/GL[Brookdale-G]/GE Chipset Integrated Graphics Device (rev 01)
2010-09-03T13:49:00.000Z	thune3	sisterd	that chipset _could_ be affected by problems Lucid has with the 8xx generation of intel graphics chips. https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Bugs/Lucidi8xxFreezes. it could be something else though
2010-09-03T13:50:00.000Z	thune3	sisterd	the shorthand for you chip is 845G or 845GL
2010-09-03T13:57:00.000Z	sisterd		hi, back, just had to switch computers because that monitor problem hiccuped on just as Thune3 was giving me some information… what was that link again?
2010-09-03T13:58:00.000Z	thune3	sisterd	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Bugs/Lucidi8xxFreezes
2010-09-03T13:58:00.000Z	sisterd		thank you for being so helpful and understanding. reading now...
2010-09-03T14:01:00.000Z	sisterd	thune3	this site has suggestions, but even the basic instructions require me to know something about my pc that I don't know… eg. is it an 8xx i855 chipset or what have you. Do you know how I find that out?
2010-09-03T14:05:00.000Z	sisterd		leroy: probably a stupid cquestion, but my processor is an 80532, si that what they are saying when they say i855 or i8sxx?
2010-09-03T14:06:00.000Z	sisterd		(and, is "GPU" the term for monitor? because reading this website i can't even tell that they are talkinga bout monitor problems...)
2010-09-03T14:06:00.000Z	thune3	sisterd	8xx means any chipset in the 800s. You have 82845G/GL[Brookdale-G]/GE which qualifies (the 82 a the beginning don't count)
2010-09-03T14:07:00.000Z	sisterd	thune3	thank you. yeah, i didnt know they were talking about the same thing because i didnt see any 3 digit numbers starting with 8….
