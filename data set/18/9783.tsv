2010-04-12T22:37:00.000Z	martian		What is the 'backup' user used for?
2010-04-12T22:37:00.000Z	erUSUL	martian	to make backups ?
2010-04-12T22:38:00.000Z	martian	erUSUL	Is it though? It's not a sudoer... I was considering using it to copy data to a NAS, but want to make sure I don't screw anything up by giving it read permissions to stuff and changing its' password
2010-04-12T22:39:00.000Z	erUSUL	martian	did you installed any backup program in this machine?
2010-04-12T22:39:00.000Z	martian	erUSUL	No
2010-04-12T22:40:00.000Z	martian	erUSUL	seems like a built in account. Don't you have one?
2010-04-12T22:41:00.000Z	erUSUL	martian	yes is probably a system account; and yes i have it
2010-07-16T19:44:00.000Z	erUSUL	martian	locale settings LC_DATE or LC_TIME
2010-07-16T19:45:00.000Z	martian	erUSUL	thanks!
2010-07-16T19:45:00.000Z	erUSUL	martian	apache probably uses C and in your terminal it uses LANG
2010-07-16T19:56:00.000Z	martian	erUSUL	I thought I'd be able to run with what you said, but I can't find any reference in any of my profile settings or in apache's configuration to set anything regarding locale... any idea where it may be set?
2010-07-16T19:56:00.000Z	erUSUL	martian	maybe in apache's init script ?
2010-07-16T19:59:00.000Z	martian	erUSUL	you know too much! Do you imagine there could be any negative consequences to changing it from C (as you suspected) to LANG?
2010-07-16T20:00:00.000Z	erUSUL	martian	it should be something like LC_ALL=C to LC_ALL=en_EN.UTF-8 or some such and i really dunno; maybe apache just ignores this
2010-07-16T20:01:00.000Z	erUSUL	martian	http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/logs.html
2010-07-16T20:02:00.000Z	martian	erUSUL	well, thanks for sharing your geniusness =D
2010-07-16T20:02:00.000Z	erUSUL	martian	no problem
2010-07-16T20:03:00.000Z	erUSUL	martian	LC_TIME is the variable ...
