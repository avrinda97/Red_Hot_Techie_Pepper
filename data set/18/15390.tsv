2005-08-02T05:31:00.000Z	liraz		why is it that ubuntu is unable to maintain compatibility with debian?
2005-08-02T05:31:00.000Z	liraz		have the developers purposely chosen to stray, i.e packages in ubuntu dont mean they will work in debian
2005-08-02T05:31:00.000Z	thoreauputic	liraz	ubuntu freezes every 6months
2005-08-02T05:32:00.000Z	thoreauputic	liraz	sarge therefore is ahead of hoary in some areas
2005-08-02T05:33:00.000Z	liraz	thoreauputic	right. but it's the same basic underlying style/structuring of a distro... so learning ubuntu would help me administer a debian system
2005-08-02T05:34:00.000Z	thoreauputic	liraz	ubuntu is almost identical under the hood , yes
2005-08-06T05:11:00.000Z	liraz	thoreauputic	yeah figured. It doesn't return anything;.
2005-08-06T05:11:00.000Z	liraz	thoreauputic	this happened before - the only app sound works in is tvtime...
2005-08-06T05:14:00.000Z	liraz	thoreauputic	right. same thing :/ I could just restart, but this has happened before...
2005-08-06T05:15:00.000Z	liraz	thoreauputic	yes it is. Why the heck does esd still exist?.. shoulden't we just fully migrate to ALSA
2005-08-06T05:17:00.000Z	thoreauputic	liraz	yeah, but we still need a sound daemon to enable multiple sounds if I understand corectly
2005-08-06T05:17:00.000Z	liraz	thoreauputic	doesn;t alsa allow that?
2005-08-06T05:17:00.000Z	thoreauputic	liraz	not by itself - unless the card supports it ( I think that's what crimsun said anyway)
2005-08-06T05:18:00.000Z	liraz	thoreauputic	I thought it could with software mixing
2005-08-06T05:18:00.000Z	thoreauputic	liraz	I don't know
2005-08-06T05:19:00.000Z	liraz	thoreauputic	gonna try logout etc to fix sound, at worst reboot
2005-08-06T05:22:00.000Z	liraz	thoreauputic	I have quite the linux unfriendly bunch of hardware. Next time I'll take into consideration
2005-09-14T11:01:00.000Z	thoreauputic	liraz	windows thinks everything non-windows is corrupted *grin*
