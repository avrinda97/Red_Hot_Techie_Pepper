2005-07-21T08:11:00.000Z	Computer__Guru		i use au cause it shows the full command line, aux tends to chop a lot off the end

2005-07-21T08:15:00.000Z	gabaug	Computer__Guru	I'm trying to hack on gnome-panel, and I need libgnome-menu-dev 2.11.1
2005-07-21T08:16:00.000Z	Computer__Guru	gabaug	so use backports :D
2005-07-21T08:23:00.000Z	gabaug	Computer__Guru	Razor-X : turns out I was getting my libgnome-menu-dev pkg from packports (I just put it in for mono..forgot that it might have other dev libs..) .. and it's still not recent enough :(
2005-07-21T08:24:00.000Z	Computer__Guru	gabaug	well, herein lies the problem. if you installt he sources to a new4er menu than what the rest of your system runs, when you recompile it to get your changes, will it even work?
2005-07-21T08:25:00.000Z	gabaug	Computer__Guru	I'd just be compiling the dev pkg .. so it would be fine (as long as I uninstalled the pkg'd version)
2005-07-21T08:26:00.000Z	Computer__Guru	gabaug	the dev package, when compiled, becomes the binary package.. ie, when you  go into gnome-menu-source dir (or whatever its called) and hack about with it then do a make and a make install, you've just replaced your production gnome-menu
2005-07-21T08:28:00.000Z	gabaug	Computer__Guru	I'm trying to hack on gnome-panel which requires libgnome-menu-dev
2005-07-21T08:28:00.000Z	Computer__Guru	gabaug	ah,t hats where i misunderstood
2005-07-21T08:33:00.000Z	gabaug	Computer__Guru	(just to pass it on) it's dammit
