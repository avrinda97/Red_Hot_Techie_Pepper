2008-01-15T09:03:00.000Z	Duke_Fluke	njneer	hi
2008-01-15T09:04:00.000Z	Duke_Fluke	njneer	whats your problem?
2008-01-15T09:06:00.000Z	njneer	Duke_Fluke	When i boot the live cd, and select install.. it asks me to configure the monitor resolution and choose graphics driver. Then it says 3 things (Last is: Running boot loader something) and then does nothing
2008-01-15T09:07:00.000Z	Duke_Fluke	njneer	so the installation process freezes at that point? Does it happen if  try it a second time?
2008-01-15T09:08:00.000Z	njneer	Duke_Fluke	Yea, its like it is waiting for me to input something. I waited for hours, nothing happens. I tried many times but the same thing happens.
2008-01-15T09:09:00.000Z	Duke_Fluke	njneer	thats a tricky one....maybe some hardware problem...did this computer have an operating system on it before? like windows?
2008-01-15T09:11:00.000Z	njneer	Duke_Fluke	Actually it currently does have windows on it. Its the hard disk im using right now. I was thinking it will ask me to format. Do I need to format it with a windows cd and then install from the live cd?
2008-01-15T09:13:00.000Z	Duke_Fluke	njneer	well if windows works ok on it then your hardware is probably ok....so then maybe some piece of hardware in your system is causing this...someone else can help us troubleshoot this? I don't know what to suggest
2008-01-15T09:14:00.000Z	Duke_Fluke	njneer	you could make sure your media is good
2008-01-15T09:15:00.000Z	Duke_Fluke	njneer	also try the media in another comp
2008-01-15T09:15:00.000Z	Duke_Fluke	njneer	try another distro too maybe
2008-01-15T09:15:00.000Z	njneer	Duke_Fluke	I made 2 cds and checked with the burning software if it copied properly. Im sure they are fine. Is there any other way i can check?
2008-01-15T09:17:00.000Z	Duke_Fluke	njneer	sounds like you know what your doing... I would try an older or newer version of Ubuntu what version are you installing?
2008-01-15T09:20:00.000Z	njneer	Duke_Fluke	I just remembered i chose the 64 bit AMD option, maybe I can try downloading the standard PC ?
2008-01-15T09:21:00.000Z	Duke_Fluke	njneer	I was jsut going to say whats your hardware? yeah that sounds like a good idea
2008-01-15T09:22:00.000Z	njneer	Duke_Fluke	Ok thanks, i'm downloading that right now. I'll try it and see if it helps. Last CD too.. hope i dont get any errors :P
2008-01-15T09:23:00.000Z	Duke_Fluke	njneer	good luck :)
