2006-12-14T17:46:00.000Z	Aji-Dahaka	mamonassassina	I answered your question...
2006-12-14T17:47:00.000Z	mamonassassina	Aji-Dahaka	you did?you told me to go to apple.com
2006-12-14T17:47:00.000Z	Aji-Dahaka	mamonassassina	after that...you know, after you asked your question
2006-12-14T17:47:00.000Z	Aji-Dahaka	mamonassassina	yeah, look just up from there
2006-12-14T17:48:00.000Z	Aji-Dahaka	mamonassassina	you hoon!  "nope, but you can use other means ... chuck out gtkpod or amarok, perhaps" <-- see that there that I wrote 6 minutes ago
2006-12-14T17:53:00.000Z	mamonassassina	Aji-Dahaka	yes,there are poor people here.
2006-12-14T17:54:00.000Z	mamonassassina	Aji-Dahaka	surely not my case though.
2006-12-14T17:55:00.000Z	mamonassassina	Aji-Dahaka	you know that an ipod here costs 3 times what an ipod costs in the Usa.
2006-12-14T17:55:00.000Z	mamonassassina	Aji-Dahaka	so...
2006-12-14T17:55:00.000Z	Aji-Dahaka	mamonassassina	I don't doubt it.  takes about 4 hours for me to earn an ipod, though.  I imagine somewhat longer for the average brasilian to earn an ipod
2006-12-14T17:56:00.000Z	mamonassassina	Aji-Dahaka	average brazilian...ya,i know some of those.
2006-12-14T17:56:00.000Z	mamonassassina	Aji-Dahaka	they work for my father.
2006-12-14T17:57:00.000Z	mamonassassina	Aji-Dahaka	still,my country has never invaded a country.
2006-12-14T17:57:00.000Z	Aji-Dahaka	mamonassassina	I wasn't going to bring that up.  I don't like insulting people just because of what country they come from.
2006-12-14T17:57:00.000Z	mamonassassina	Aji-Dahaka	"brasil is surely cheap"
2006-12-14T17:58:00.000Z	Aji-Dahaka	mamonassassina	I've heard that
