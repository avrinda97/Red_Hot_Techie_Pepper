2005-03-10T16:46:00.000Z	shad0w1e		you're not going to believe it but my 3d started working again!
2005-03-10T16:46:00.000Z	shad0w1e		I have a feeling that I would've spent more time trying to get THAT working, than just screwing up and accidentally deleting the entire X system, and having it just work when I put it back...
2005-03-10T16:48:00.000Z	shad0w1e		well thanks guys, you've all been a great help
2005-03-10T16:48:00.000Z	shad0w1e		peace..
2005-03-10T16:13:00.000Z	shad0w1e		Hi, I'm trying to add an entry to my fstab file, but it has a space in it. How do I go about doing that?
2005-03-10T16:14:00.000Z	crimsun	shad0w1e	use quotes ("") around the entire entry
2005-03-10T16:14:00.000Z	crimsun	shad0w1e	echo "foo like this" | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
2005-04-25T11:44:00.000Z	crimsun	shad0w1e	did you reboot after you dist-upgraded?
2005-05-09T12:43:00.000Z	crimsun	shad0w1e	(no hardware-accelerated 3d)
2005-05-31T08:28:00.000Z	crimsun	shad0w1e	do you mean users who can only log in via vsftpd?
2005-05-31T08:29:00.000Z	shad0w1e	crimsun	yes, no telnet, no ssh
2005-05-31T08:29:00.000Z	crimsun	shad0w1e	sure. look at vsftpd's virtual users.
2005-05-31T08:31:00.000Z	crimsun	shad0w1e	well, you can have them as real users on the system, too, and simply disallow them to log in via ssh. See the appropriate directives in man sshd_config
2005-05-31T08:32:00.000Z	shad0w1e	crimsun	I'm not a linux expert. If I block out ssh and telnet, does that just about restrict them to only ftp?
2005-09-18T11:37:00.000Z	crimsun	shad0w1e	the leftmost output will be 'l'
2006-06-19T11:15:00.000Z	crimsun	shad0w1e	more than likely, yes. Which chipset specifically?
2006-06-19T11:19:00.000Z	shad0w1e	crimsun	Intel Proset wireless 2915ABG
2006-06-20T11:39:00.000Z	shad0w1e	crimsun	ah thanks!
