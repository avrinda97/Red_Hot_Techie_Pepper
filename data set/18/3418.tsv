2009-12-08T10:03:00.000Z	con-man	FireCrotch	I dont have that installed so this is interesting
2009-12-08T10:03:00.000Z	FireCrotch	con-man	Your router is likely caching DNS entries, and your router is likely set as your default DNS server
2009-12-08T10:04:00.000Z	con-man	FireCrotch	maybe opendns is better
2009-12-08T10:05:00.000Z	FireCrotch	con-man	Interestingly, Google just opened a set of public DNS servers that you could use. I believe they are 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4
2009-12-08T10:09:00.000Z	FireCrotch	con-man	4chan is experiencing a DoS attack, as far as I know
2009-12-08T10:09:00.000Z	con-man	FireCrotch	right now?  status.4chan.org doesn't say that
2009-12-08T10:10:00.000Z	FireCrotch	con-man	It was completely unreachable earlier today, I don't know the current status
