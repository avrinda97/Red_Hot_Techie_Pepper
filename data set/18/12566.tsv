2006-04-12T16:00:00.000Z	jnk	_harm	ok.... try running mplayer directly from the command line, like this:  mplayer -vo xv -fs  some_file.avi
2006-04-12T16:02:00.000Z	_harm	jnk	that works :P but sadly it doesnt do it via GUI :S...
2006-04-12T16:02:00.000Z	jnk	_harm	what gui is it?
2006-04-12T16:03:00.000Z	jnk	_harm	and if you just run: mplayer some_file.avi does it work (after you manually switch to full screen by pressing 'f')
2006-04-12T16:03:00.000Z	_harm	jnk	ill try
2006-04-12T16:05:00.000Z	_harm	jnk	yes that works aswell.. but it doesnt work when i start up via K(startbutton)>>multimedia>>mplayer then  it doesnt work
2006-04-12T16:06:00.000Z	jnk	_harm	while you have this gui running, can you check the name of the process (in the output from "ps aux")
