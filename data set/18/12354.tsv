2006-06-15T10:32:00.000Z	keleus		Can anyone reccomend an IDE (or some kind of development system other than the shell) for a beginner to learn C++ in?
2006-06-15T10:33:00.000Z	keleus		or even a book?
2006-06-15T10:34:00.000Z	keleus		yea
2006-06-15T10:34:00.000Z	keleus		but i put it back :) the Dummies series doesn't work well for me
2006-06-15T10:34:00.000Z	keleus		the "raw" style used in college textbooks is.... AH
2006-06-15T10:35:00.000Z	keleus		can you buy textbooks at a college bookstore without being a student there?
2006-06-15T10:35:00.000Z	keleus		i think i'll hit the local campus' book stores
2006-06-15T10:36:00.000Z	keleus		or, maybe i should take a single class while im waiting to become a resident...
2006-06-15T10:36:00.000Z	Sivik	keleus	anyone can buy stuff at a college library
2006-06-15T10:43:00.000Z	keleus	Sivik	i have a netgear WG511T and it works fine natively on Dapper... madwifi has it well supported (atheros chipset)
2006-06-15T10:44:00.000Z	Sivik	keleus	ok
2006-06-15T10:44:00.000Z	Sivik	keleus	tell billgates1337``
2006-06-17T11:23:00.000Z	keleus	Sivik	heh, i compile them myself :)
2006-06-17T11:23:00.000Z	Sivik	keleus	thats not fun
2006-06-17T11:23:00.000Z	keleus	Sivik	not if you know how to do it, and exactly what is in your machine. Definatly speeds things up in my case (and frees up some memory too :) )
2006-06-17T11:25:00.000Z	keleus	Sivik	well, you need "binutils" and "build-essential" - then you need to install the dev library of ncurses to use "make menuconfig" - its not very forthright about needing that stuff
2006-06-17T11:40:00.000Z	keleus	Sivik	was that needed?
2006-06-17T11:40:00.000Z	Sivik	keleus	i just said good for you, didn't mean for it to be mean or anything
