2008-03-28T20:26:00.000Z	xukun		how can I use my remote control with ubuntu?
2008-03-28T20:27:00.000Z	bazhang	xukun	to do what exactly? could you clarify please
2008-03-28T20:28:00.000Z	xukun	bazhang	hi there I would like to control music, video etc
2008-03-28T20:29:00.000Z	bazhang	xukun	that is more of a hardware issue; does your computer have an IR port?
2008-03-28T20:33:00.000Z	xukun	bazhang	I have a a remote control which is already detected as  lirc_mceusb2: Philips eHome USB IR Transciever and Microsoft MCE 2005 Remote Control driver for LIRC
2008-03-28T20:33:00.000Z	xukun	bazhang	but where do I go from here
2008-03-28T20:34:00.000Z	bazhang	xukun	I remember seeing someone had gotten their Wiimote to do that; cant find the link however
2008-03-28T20:34:00.000Z	xukun	bazhang	hmm
2008-04-04T12:26:00.000Z	bazhang	xukun	your computer has IR? then perhaps but not sure about mplayer
2008-04-04T12:28:00.000Z	xukun	bazhang	I have this: usbcore: registered new interface driver lirc_mceusb2 and the remote works, but I want use it with mplayer
2008-04-04T12:29:00.000Z	bazhang	xukun	that sounds quite exotic; good luck on getting it going with that app--I saw a youtube of someone controlling compiz using a wiimote so it might well be possible
2008-04-04T12:30:00.000Z	xukun	bazhang	thanks anyway
2008-04-04T12:44:00.000Z	xukun	bazhang	I get figured out to mplayer with my remote control
2008-04-04T12:44:00.000Z	bazhang	xukun	you did it?
2008-04-04T12:45:00.000Z	xukun	bazhang	yes en its was not that hard either
2008-04-04T12:46:00.000Z	bazhang	xukun	post it to ubuntuforums please! you will be hailed by all and sundry ;]
