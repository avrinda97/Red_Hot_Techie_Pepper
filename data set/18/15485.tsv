2005-03-17T08:09:00.000Z	eleazar-	eruin	thx you it worked
2005-03-17T08:11:00.000Z	eruin	eleazar-	I hear ntfs write support is still kind of experimental though :->
2005-03-17T08:11:00.000Z	eruin	eleazar-	yeh
2005-03-17T08:13:00.000Z	eleazar-	eruin	i did everything (apt-get the nvidia-kernel-common and nvidia-glx, modprobe nvidia, change the X11 config file) and still i dont get acceleration =/
2005-03-17T08:13:00.000Z	eruin	eleazar-	using the offical drivers though
2005-03-17T08:13:00.000Z	eleazar-	eruin	and you didnt have any problems with the official drivers?
2005-03-17T08:18:00.000Z	eleazar-	eruin	well i dont know if it works.. but it didnt show the NVIDIA logo when it started
2005-03-17T08:18:00.000Z	eruin	eleazar-	what does glxgears give you if run from an x terminal?
2005-03-17T08:21:00.000Z	eruin	eleazar-	humm, I'm not familiar with using the ubuntu package for it
2005-03-17T08:22:00.000Z	eruin	eleazar-	I just got the drivers off nvidia.com, apt-get installed linux-headers-k7 and installed the driver
2005-03-17T08:23:00.000Z	eruin	eleazar-	might wanna dpkg --purge nvidia-glx first
2005-03-17T08:24:00.000Z	eleazar-	eruin	my processor is an athlon, what headers are good for me?
2005-03-17T08:27:00.000Z	eleazar-	eruin	the k7 ones will work fine with me?
