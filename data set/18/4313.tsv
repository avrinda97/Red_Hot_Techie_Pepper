2010-07-03T03:48:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	vaul	are you using nvidia?
2010-07-03T03:48:00.000Z	vaul	ZykoticK9	Yes.
2010-07-03T03:49:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	vaul	check out mplayer with VDPAU support - hardware graphics card assisted video rendering!  There is a vdpau PPA you can add, but you might be able to just install libvdpau1 and have it work with the PPA I believe.  Good luck.
2010-07-03T03:50:00.000Z	vaul	ZykoticK9	Can any other player suppor that?
2010-07-03T03:50:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	vaul	sorry s/with/without the PPA
2010-07-03T03:50:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	vaul	the newest VLC (NOT in repo or probably packaged for Debian yet) has SOME sort of hardware support.
2010-07-03T03:50:00.000Z	vaul	ZykoticK9	Okay, that's something to start with. I'll try, thank you.
2010-07-03T03:52:00.000Z	vaul	ZykoticK9	Reminded me of that xcbd comic: «—It took a lot of work, but that linux patch enables support for 4,096 CPU's, up from the old limit of 1,024. —Do you have support for smooth HDTV video playback? —No, but who uses that?»
2010-07-03T03:53:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	vaul	:)  I didn't see that one.
2010-07-03T04:21:00.000Z	vaul	ZykoticK9	Well, they have support not only for 4,096 cores now.
2010-07-03T04:22:00.000Z	vaul	ZykoticK9	It is really easy to get lubvdpau working with VLC now.
2010-07-03T04:23:00.000Z	vaul	ZykoticK9	Everything neccessary is present in repositories.
2010-07-03T04:23:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	vaul	i have NO idea!  I just read the news that the feature was added!  I use mplayer for everything myself.
2010-07-03T04:23:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	vaul	i HIGHLY doubt the version you need is in any repose.  check webpd8 site?
2010-07-03T04:24:00.000Z	vaul	ZykoticK9	Just install VLC, libvdpau — both from repositories, mark the checkbox «Use hardware acceleration» in VLC, and voiala!
2010-07-03T04:24:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	vaul	NICE
2010-07-03T04:25:00.000Z	vaul	ZykoticK9	Unfortunately, support is not perfect, so system load is still high, but acceptable.
2010-07-03T04:25:00.000Z	vaul	ZykoticK9	So, thanks again — I'll be going.
