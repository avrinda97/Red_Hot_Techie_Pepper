2010-07-27T06:09:00.000Z	econdudeawesome		Why would x fail to load at startup, instead go to the command line, and work when I run "startx"?
2010-07-27T06:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	econdudeawesome	 i had issues in beta with GDM and the nvidia modules.. GDM dident wait long enough for the moudles and X to get started. so it thought it was crashing and killed X.   if i did startx it would workl
2010-07-27T06:11:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	Dr_Willis	is there a way to manually set it to longer? I just instaled the nVidia driver, so that sounds like it could be it
2010-07-27T06:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	econdudeawesome	 the gdm configs have some settings. check the forums - this was a common problem duiring beta. but i thought it had been fixed.
2010-07-27T06:12:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	Dr_Willis	guess not with my too fast of rig ;-D
2010-07-27T06:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	econdudeawesome	 machine speed disent seem to matter.
2010-07-27T06:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	econdudeawesome	 i recall changing 2 of the gdm config files. not had the issue since..
2010-07-27T06:13:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	Dr_Willis	would I do that through the sudo dpkg-reconfigure gdm?
2010-07-27T06:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	econdudeawesome	 no. you edit the proper gdm config file by hand and add some delay setting. i cant even find it on this box now. this is a new install, i dont have the issue any more.
2010-07-27T06:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	econdudeawesome	 i cant even find my forum posts on the subject/thread.  I wonder if they clear out the beta threads?
2010-07-27T06:39:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	Dr_Willis	if you have anyone else come up with the error, they can try repeating what I did: installing wdm, choosing wdm, restarting, apt-get remove gdm, apt-get install gdm, choose gdm
2010-07-27T06:40:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	Dr_Willis	I'm not sure how to report bugs, so I wanted to through that your way
2010-07-27T06:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	econdudeawesome	 that seem more like a 'fluke' then a fix. I had mine 'fixed' several times then the problem came back.. untill i set up the longer timeout.
2010-07-27T06:40:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	Dr_Willis	not sure its a fluke--I've set up this system and then put on about 3 GB of software and updates--I figured reinstalling gdm would automatically fix config files
2010-07-27T06:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	econdudeawesome	 gekko95  my netbook. i plugged in external, booted up. used the fn-whatever keys to toggle on the external, then used the 'monitors' tool to set the proper res.
2010-07-27T06:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	econdudeawesome	 reinstalling gdm would reinsstall the identical original config files.. IF you had 'purged' gdm. if you removed gdm but did not use purge.. then it should of kept the earlier config files.. so i dont see how your method changed anything at all.
2010-07-27T06:45:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	Dr_Willis	true enough. I'll give it a purge and see how it goes
2010-07-30T06:48:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	econdudeawesome	 clarify what you mean.  you can have a /boot/ parittion on a hard drive. Normally its the first partition on the drive. but the MBR gets installed tio the mbr of the drive. ie: /dev/sda  not /dev/sda1
