2011-07-24T05:05:00.000Z	chilversc		ok, this is random, sometimes I boot and it hangs at "Starting AppArmor", other times it will reach the login screen but after logging in the desktop doesn't come up leaving me with a blank wallpaper
2011-07-24T05:06:00.000Z	chilversc		how do I switch to tty1 ?
2011-07-24T05:07:00.000Z	bazhang	chilversc	are you in unity?
2011-07-24T05:08:00.000Z	bazhang	chilversc	what about ctrl alt T
2011-07-24T05:08:00.000Z	bazhang	chilversc	did you try my suggestion or not
2011-07-24T05:09:00.000Z	chilversc	bazhang	doesn't do anything
2011-07-24T05:09:00.000Z	bazhang	chilversc	you are in unity, with only wallpaper, correct?
2011-07-24T05:09:00.000Z	chilversc	bazhang	I assume so
2011-07-24T05:09:00.000Z	bazhang	chilversc	I had the same issue,
2011-07-24T05:10:00.000Z	chilversc	bazhang	though I'm not sure what unity is
2011-07-24T05:10:00.000Z	chilversc	bazhang	I'm suspecting it has something to do with the nvidia driver the monitor settings offers to install?
2011-07-24T05:10:00.000Z	bazhang	chilversc	keep trying to get the gnome terminal either via alt f2 or ctrl alt T, it will show up, eventually
2011-07-24T05:12:00.000Z	bazhang	chilversc	its an easy fix, no need for that
2011-07-24T05:12:00.000Z	bazhang	chilversc	up to you however
2011-07-24T05:12:00.000Z	chilversc	bazhang	well, it refuses to bring up the terminal no matter what
2011-07-24T05:12:00.000Z	chilversc	bazhang	and sometimes it fails to reach the log in screen (hangs after "Starting AppArmor"
2011-07-24T05:16:00.000Z	chilversc	bazhang	so now, the screen goes purple, ubuntu logo shows, screen flashes black/white a few times, and then some text shows on a black background with the final line "Starting AppArmor profiles"
2011-07-24T05:26:00.000Z	chilversc	bazhang	ah ha, I've found the terminal so what's this fix?
