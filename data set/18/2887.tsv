2010-01-29T19:39:00.000Z	Nhzd		is there any known issues with intel graphics hardware on 9.10? I'm attempting to figure out what is wrong with a laptop that slows down to an unusable state even when using something as simple as a solitaire game.
2010-01-29T19:41:00.000Z	Nhzd		9.04 was also rather slow, while older than that worked well
2010-01-29T19:41:00.000Z	kaddi	Nhzd	I'm still having loads of issues with intel on 9.10, so for me it is a yes. I'm using ppa to get more updated drivers, they work better for me. http://ppa.launchpad.net/ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates/ubuntu
2010-01-29T19:41:00.000Z	kaddi	Nhzd	yes 9.04 was hell. Karmic works a lot better, but as said, it's not completely well
2010-01-29T19:42:00.000Z	Nhzd		aye, the 9.04 I know about, but most sources say those particular issues are resolved in 9.10
2010-01-29T19:42:00.000Z	Nhzd	kaddi	thank you, I'll give those a shot
2010-01-29T19:42:00.000Z	kaddi	Nhzd	I'm also still running the edgers reps: deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/xorg-edgers/ppa/ubuntu karmic main
2010-01-29T19:45:00.000Z	Nhzd	kaddi	thanks, might try those as well then, can't get that much worse. I've thought of downgrading to 8.10, but as that's EOL in April, it doesn't actually help for long
2010-01-29T19:47:00.000Z	kaddi		nhzd did you see mguys comment? 8.04 has EOL 04/11
2010-01-29T19:49:00.000Z	Nhzd	kaddi	mguy: really? https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ says otherwise
2010-01-29T19:49:00.000Z	kaddi	Nhzd	8.04 not 8.10 ;)
2010-01-29T19:49:00.000Z	Nhzd		8.04 I know of, but 8.04 had its own problems
2010-01-29T19:49:00.000Z	kaddi		ah, ok
2010-01-29T19:50:00.000Z	Nhzd		8.04 had issues with power saving, cpu fan was constantly running
2010-01-29T19:50:00.000Z	Nhzd		though maybe a backported kernel to 8.04
2010-01-29T19:51:00.000Z	kaddi	Nhzd	well then lucid will be released in april, maybe that'll finally fix the whole intel issue *fingerscrossed*
2010-01-29T19:52:00.000Z	Nhzd	kaddi	I sincerely hope so :)
2010-01-29T19:52:00.000Z	kaddi	Nhzd	me too :D
