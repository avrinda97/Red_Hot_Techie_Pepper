2006-12-11T16:27:00.000Z	serge_		 What are the minimum specs for a laptop to do some decent work on it, like browsing IM and IRC.
2006-12-11T16:27:00.000Z	serge_		for xubuntiu
2006-12-11T16:28:00.000Z	soundray	serge_	I don't know, but I have a Celeron 300MHz with 192MB RAM that works well enough with xubuntu
2006-12-11T16:29:00.000Z	serge_	soundray	Ok thx, i have a P3 455mhz with 64 ram, so the bottleneck is the ram i think?
2006-12-11T16:29:00.000Z	soundray	serge_	I guess 64MB is roughly the RAM minimum for your requirement
2006-12-11T16:30:00.000Z	serge_	soundray	you mean to only "run" ubuntu, not work with it?
2006-12-11T16:30:00.000Z	soundray	serge_	you will need a special install CD for that little RAM. Better to get a hold of some extra RAM from somewhere.
2006-12-11T16:30:00.000Z	serge_	soundray	Ok thx :), what is that install cd called?
2006-12-11T16:30:00.000Z	soundray	serge_	I responded specific to the app requirement you mentioned.
2006-12-11T16:31:00.000Z	soundray	serge_	I can't remember, but you can't miss it on www.xubuntu.org
2006-12-11T16:32:00.000Z	serge_	soundray	Hmm, my laptop is very very slow when i Browse, IRC and IM.
2006-12-11T16:32:00.000Z	soundray	serge_	so you have it already?
2006-12-11T16:32:00.000Z	serge_	soundray	yes.
2006-12-11T16:32:00.000Z	soundray	serge_	xubuntu I mean
2006-12-11T16:32:00.000Z	serge_	soundray	I already installed it.
2006-12-11T16:33:00.000Z	soundray	serge_	your question should have been 'My laptop is very slow with Xubuntu. What can I do?' rather than about minimum requirements.
2006-12-11T16:34:00.000Z	serge_	soundray	yeah sorry about that, my english grammer isnt that good :)
2006-12-11T16:34:00.000Z	soundray	serge_	that's a matter of common sense, not grammar.
