2007-07-14T05:31:00.000Z	Biteyn-1		I tried installing ubuntu but i kept getting xserver errors when i did configure it the live cd would load only if i did cd check it would not do the check but it would boot the kernel and i would have to press alt f4 to get live cd to load and when it was loaded it would take forever..so im guessing i have to update ram on that computer it has (256MB) people said it should be fine but i dunno
2007-07-14T05:32:00.000Z	Biteyn-1		people told me to use the alternate cd on that computer but i want to keep the windows partition on it..
2007-07-14T05:33:00.000Z	Biteyn-1		not sure what the motherboard is
2007-07-14T05:34:00.000Z	Biteyn-1		so i should just use alternate cd?
2007-07-14T05:34:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Biteyn-1	if you are having graphics issues with livecd yes use alternate
2007-07-14T05:35:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Biteyn-1	yes except installing from alternate isnt as pretty
2007-07-14T05:35:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Biteyn-1	yes for the most part
2007-07-14T05:36:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Biteyn-1	there isnt a point and click
2007-07-14T05:36:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Biteyn-1	than you should be fine
2007-07-14T05:37:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Biteyn-1	no no commands it gives you choices just as live does only cant point and click
2007-07-14T05:40:00.000Z	Biteyn-1	gnomefreak	then thats the prob then the computer needs more ram
2007-07-14T05:41:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Biteyn-1	256 for feisty livecd is minimum
2007-07-14T05:42:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Biteyn-1	that tells you it will run it not that it will run it good
2007-07-14T05:42:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Biteyn-1	once installed you are fine with 256
2007-07-14T05:43:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Biteyn-1	yes the livecd has to load everything in memory without swap
2007-07-14T05:44:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Biteyn-1	yes
2007-07-14T05:44:00.000Z	Biteyn-1	gnomefreak	thanks for your help :)
2007-07-14T05:44:00.000Z	gnomefreak	Biteyn-1	yw
