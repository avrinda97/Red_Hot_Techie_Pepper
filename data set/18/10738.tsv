2006-10-29T14:20:00.000Z	zolux		hi, everybody
2006-10-29T14:21:00.000Z	zolux		after an upgrade to edgy, I can't boot anymore, I'm with a hoary live CD now and gparted tell me that sda5's filesystem is unknown
2006-10-29T14:22:00.000Z	Ademan	zolux	what happens when you try to boot?\
2006-10-29T14:23:00.000Z	zolux	Ademan	waiting for /dev/mapper/Ubuntu-root (don't boot on recovery either)
2006-10-29T14:23:00.000Z	Ademan	zolux	wierd, so you dist-upgraded huh?
2006-10-29T14:24:00.000Z	zolux	Ademan	apt-get update, dist-upgrade twice, check on ubuntu-minimal and ubuntu-desktop
2006-10-29T14:24:00.000Z	Ademan	zolux	geeze
2006-10-29T14:24:00.000Z	Ademan		either way i'd say your upgrade is what broke your comp
2006-10-29T14:25:00.000Z	Ademan		anyways
2006-10-29T14:25:00.000Z	Ademan	zolux	if you're at all able, i reccomend backing up everything you love and hold dear and installing fresh
2006-10-29T14:26:00.000Z	zolux	Ademan	how can I backup a disk I can't mount?
2006-10-29T14:26:00.000Z	Ademan	zolux	can't you mount it from your liveCD?
2006-10-29T14:26:00.000Z	zolux	Ademan	no, it says that it's already mounted
2006-10-29T14:27:00.000Z	Ademan		ouch
2006-10-29T14:28:00.000Z	zolux		fdisk -l -> sda 1 (Linux, bootable), sda2 (extended), sda5 (LVM)
2006-10-29T14:29:00.000Z	Ademan	zolux	sorry, i'm not that smart haha, i dunno what to tell you
2006-10-29T14:29:00.000Z	Ademan	zolux	have you tried explicitly unmounting it?
2006-10-29T14:30:00.000Z	zolux	Ademan	yes, it's unmounted
