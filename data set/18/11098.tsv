2006-10-14T12:52:00.000Z	Kingsqueak		I've got a question, did dual-boot Ubuntu over an XP Media Center install, used the Ubuntu partition resize in install and now XP won't boot, the std grub entry doesn't work, GRUB doesn't recognize the filesystem type
2006-10-14T12:52:00.000Z	Kingsqueak		I can mount the XP partition and read all the files no problem, so it's still there
2006-10-14T12:54:00.000Z	Kingsqueak		and that works...it's what I'm on now ;-)
2006-10-14T12:56:00.000Z	Kingsqueak		the sda2 is a rescue image that HP ships on its systems, it's there and will boot and run actually but panics doing a rescue because it assumes partitioning that I have changed
2006-10-14T12:56:00.000Z	Kingsqueak		I can paste the whole thing if you like, the rest is the normal Ubuntu stuff in sda3
2006-10-14T12:58:00.000Z	Kingsqueak		if I try to directly chainload a file say /$Boot it says, cannot mount filesystem
2006-10-14T12:59:00.000Z	Kingsqueak		I think I actually have to buy XP and just re-install
2006-10-14T12:59:00.000Z	THX-1138	Kingsqueak	conf files are funny. one , instead or . and anarchy
2006-10-14T12:59:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	THX-1138	I'm *fairly* certain on this one
2006-10-14T13:00:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	THX-1138	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/26777/
2006-10-14T13:00:00.000Z	THX-1138	Kingsqueak	That is a link to the older file?
2006-10-14T13:01:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	THX-1138	the only diff with that and one of the boxes that works, installed the same way is they have root, and not rootnoverify, which doesn't work on this one
2006-10-14T13:07:00.000Z	THX-1138	Kingsqueak	That looks like mine. But the mechanism ill be final arbitor on booting. all decisions are final and irrevocable. period. - lol
2006-10-14T13:08:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	THX-1138	yeah I think I caught a bug in parted, it's not something I'm new to and I've driven myself insane for a week trying anything I could find
2006-10-14T13:10:00.000Z	THX-1138	Kingsqueak	Reading through some arcania i stumbled upon the penguin sleuth kit and the app "testdisk". - haven't needed it yet but glad it's there.
2006-10-14T13:10:00.000Z	THX-1138	Kingsqueak	lol
2006-10-14T13:11:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	THX-1138	I think I need to restore the windows boot record, which means a re-install for me, then again I may just say screw it and only use the work laptop Win when I need it
2006-10-14T13:11:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	THX-1138	the fun part is the only things I own that require Windows are a Logitech remote and a GPS and only for updating, pain in the ass
