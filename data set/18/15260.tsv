2005-04-29T16:30:00.000Z	thr1ce		anyone know of a good CD burning utility?
2005-04-29T16:30:00.000Z	thr1ce		i suppose k3b would be tough without kde
2005-04-29T16:30:00.000Z	djm62	thr1ce	you can use it
2005-04-29T16:45:00.000Z	djm62	thr1ce	might not suit you coming from slack, but it's free to try anyhow
2005-04-29T16:45:00.000Z	thr1ce	djm62	why do you say that ?
2005-04-29T16:45:00.000Z	djm62	thr1ce	because slack does things differently enough....depends what you prefer
2005-04-29T16:46:00.000Z	thr1ce	djm62	doesn't seem that different...taking a break from compiling might be a change i'm willing to accept
2005-04-29T16:46:00.000Z	thr1ce	djm62	it's just tough for me; is apt-get efficient at what it does ?
2005-04-29T16:46:00.000Z	djm62	thr1ce	very
2005-04-29T16:46:00.000Z	djm62	thr1ce	it's like the Arthur C Clarke thing..."sufficiently advanced"
2005-04-29T16:47:00.000Z	thr1ce	djm62	I mean...if I remove a package, will it remove *everything* ?
2005-04-29T16:47:00.000Z	djm62	thr1ce	it caches the packages by default, but that can be cleaned if you want
2005-04-29T16:49:00.000Z	djm62	thr1ce	yeah...it makes sense
2005-06-25T11:59:00.000Z	djm62	thr1ce	does nautilus do that automatically?
2005-06-25T12:00:00.000Z	djm62	thr1ce	I meant the loopback stuff...last time I used that, it involved being root
2005-06-25T12:02:00.000Z	djm62	thr1ce	why is that?
2005-06-25T12:02:00.000Z	thr1ce	djm62	it's just like mounting a CD or HDD
2005-06-25T12:03:00.000Z	djm62	thr1ce	certainly mounting it at kernel level, that's obvious, but why can't user-space tools interpret the contents of an ISO and let you get files off it?
