2008-07-07T06:58:00.000Z	bazhang	mib	check in synaptic package manager
2008-07-07T06:58:00.000Z	mib	bazhang	ya..i check that..but the R version reflected is still old
2008-07-07T07:00:00.000Z	mib	bazhang	i choose that packages and redo Mark all Upgrades but still the same
2008-07-07T07:00:00.000Z	bazhang	mib	the newest is not in the repos?

2008-08-29T10:24:00.000Z	bazhang	mib	you can directly upgrade to Hardy Heron if you wish
2008-08-29T10:25:00.000Z	bazhang	mib	you do want to upgrade?
2008-08-29T10:25:00.000Z	bazhang	mib	would this be via net or dl'in g the cd and doing a fresh install
2008-08-29T10:26:00.000Z	bazhang	mib	that is one way yes
2008-08-29T10:26:00.000Z	bazhang	mib	but to upgrade to gutsy is not a one-step deal
2008-08-29T10:27:00.000Z	bazhang	mib	which version do you have, and which version do you need
2008-08-29T10:32:00.000Z	bazhang	mib	I dont see the package R
2008-08-29T10:33:00.000Z	bazhang	mib	the version in hardy seems to be what you want
2008-08-29T10:33:00.000Z	bazhang	mib	not safely no
