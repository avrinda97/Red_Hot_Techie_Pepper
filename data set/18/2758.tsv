2010-03-01T04:03:00.000Z	garhol	anandre	- you can probably also kill it with using top, then hitting k to kill and entering the process is of the wow window
2010-03-01T04:04:00.000Z	garhol	anandre	open a terminal, then type top and hit return. once it brings up a list look for wow. there will be an entry in the column PID. press k to kill, enter that PID number then Y for yes
2010-03-01T04:06:00.000Z	anandre	garhol	thank you for that.  Does anyone have experience running WoW under Wine?
2010-03-01T04:06:00.000Z	garhol	anandre	not wow, gfx card is too old but I run some steam apps
2010-03-01T04:08:00.000Z	garhol	anandre	wow was gold under ubuntu 9.04. no reports for 9.10 yet -> http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version&iId=14154
2010-03-01T04:08:00.000Z	anandre	garhol	so perhaps try to use 9.04 over 9.10 then?
2010-03-01T04:09:00.000Z	garhol	anandre	it should really only be the wine version that affects it. 9.10 should be allright with wine 1.1.23
2010-03-01T04:10:00.000Z	anandre	garhol	which is what I'm using.  I tried to run it from the launcher and it might work - I got the log-in screen at least.  Will report more once I get somewhere.
2010-03-01T04:10:00.000Z	garhol	anandre	k. I'll go grab the trial and see if I can give you any info
2010-03-01T04:11:00.000Z	anandre	garhol	appreciate it.  Didn't get it to run quite yet, but I'm going to try and use the troubleshoot page.
2010-03-01T04:23:00.000Z	garhol	anandre	wine-1.1.39 running the trial seems to be working, a few glitches here and there but killing and restarting the app seemed to fix them
2010-03-01T04:24:00.000Z	anandre	garhol	if only I had your problems.  :(  I can run the launcher fine, but when I try to run WoW from that, I just a black screen (albeit with the WoW pointer).  Can't do anything until I hit escape, which brings me back to my normal screen.
2010-03-01T04:26:00.000Z	anandre	garhol	I'll give that a try.
2010-03-01T04:29:00.000Z	anandre	garhol	would I be looking at some kind of hardware issue with all these problems?  When I had the computer checked out, I was told it's probably a software issue (this was re: Windows not booting, but with the problems trying to run Wine...),  but this is frustrating beyond belief.
2010-03-01T04:31:00.000Z	garhol	anandre	wine can be a little tempremental but there's a possibility it's a hardware issue. I wouldn't like to hazard a guess as the two could be related but there's nothing that jumps out straight away.
2010-03-01T04:32:00.000Z	garhol	anandre	the launcher launching would indicate that wine is working but it sounds like the problem arises when dx9 kicks in and the game starts properly
2010-03-01T04:34:00.000Z	garhol	anandre	no prob, sorry I couldn't help more
2010-03-01T04:34:00.000Z	anandre	garhol	I think my rig is beyond help now.  :s thanks for trying though
