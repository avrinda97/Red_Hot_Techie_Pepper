2004-11-15T06:00:00.000Z	the_one		hi
2004-11-15T06:02:00.000Z	the_one		how do I run a .bin? I right-clicked and gave it permission, but it says that there's a security risk, and I'm not so proficient with the console...I just wanna try realplayer
2004-11-15T06:03:00.000Z	the_one		anyone?
2004-11-15T06:03:00.000Z	cardador	the_one	or sh file.bin
2004-11-15T06:07:00.000Z	cardador	the_one	yap
2004-11-15T06:19:00.000Z	cardador	the_one	why is that? k3b is, for now, the best application for burning cds, so why dont use it?
2004-11-15T06:21:00.000Z	cardador	the_one	it looks for me... if you choose the same theme for gtk2, gtk and kde
2004-11-15T06:22:00.000Z	the_one	cardador	can you provide a screenshot, or am I asking too much?
2004-11-15T06:26:00.000Z	the_one	cardador	can't get your screenshot
2004-11-15T06:26:00.000Z	cardador	the_one	im trying again
2004-11-15T06:27:00.000Z	cardador	the_one	ill try other approach
2004-12-02T17:34:00.000Z	cardador	the_one	write fonts:// in nautilus, then drag and drop tahoma in there
2004-12-02T17:36:00.000Z	the_one	cardador	I would do that, but I don't have the permissions, I tried to log in as root after re-enabling the root account in order to do this, but it won't log me in
2004-12-02T17:37:00.000Z	cardador	the_one	just drop the font in there, after restarting X tahoma will be available
2004-12-02T17:37:00.000Z	the_one	cardador	will try
2004-12-02T17:39:00.000Z	the_one	cardador	I dragged them into fonts:/// but they don't show in there
2004-12-02T17:40:00.000Z	cardador	the_one	dont worry, restart x and itll be in there
2004-12-02T17:40:00.000Z	the_one	cardador	ok, thanx, hope'll work
