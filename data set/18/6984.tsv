2008-02-22T18:49:00.000Z	dgjones	nipzor	you might need to install xserver-xgl and then restart x
2008-02-22T18:54:00.000Z	dgjones	nipzor	Have a look at this https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompositeManager/Xgl/simple - It refers to ATI Radeon and how to get desktop effect working
2008-02-22T18:54:00.000Z	nipzor	dgjones	okay ty :]
2008-02-22T18:54:00.000Z	dgjones	nipzor	basically, run "sudo apt-get install xserver-xgl" and restart your computer
2008-02-22T18:57:00.000Z	dgjones	nipzor	have you got Synpatic open?
2008-02-22T18:57:00.000Z	nipzor	dgjones	yes
2008-02-22T18:58:00.000Z	dgjones	nipzor	either close synaptic and rerun the command, or use synaptic to search for the command and install that way, you can do one or the other, but not both at the same time
2008-02-22T19:03:00.000Z	dgjones	nipzor	using synaptic to search, look for xserver-xgl and install that package, then you need to restart the computer
2008-02-22T19:04:00.000Z	nipzor	dgjones	i cant find anything ;_;
2008-02-22T19:05:00.000Z	nipzor	dgjones	well okay i found it >_<
2008-02-22T19:06:00.000Z	dgjones	nipzor	install that and then restart, thats what https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CompositeManager/Xgl/simple suggests for you to get desktop effects working
2008-02-22T19:06:00.000Z	nipzor	dgjones	okay i will reboot now, cya in a minute
2008-02-22T19:09:00.000Z	nipzor	dgjones	yay it workes >
2008-02-22T19:09:00.000Z	dgjones	nipzor	well done
2008-02-22T19:12:00.000Z	nipzor	dgjones	do you have some experience with steam on linux?
2008-02-22T19:12:00.000Z	dgjones	nipzor	sorry, thats something i've not used, just ask in the channel, if somebody knows and is around, they might be able to help
2008-02-22T19:13:00.000Z	dgjones	nipzor	you're welcome
