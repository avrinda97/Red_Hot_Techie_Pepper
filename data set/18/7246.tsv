2008-11-19T20:37:00.000Z	JonathanEllis		﻿Hi, I am reinstalling Grub after a windows install. After sudo grub I type root (hd0,5) as the partition containing /boot is /dev/sda6. Grub reports Error 23: Error while parsing number. The first time I did this I put the wrong root in as I misunderstood, thinking I needed the location of /boot/grub (I have a dedicated grub partitio). Any ideas please?
2008-11-19T20:38:00.000Z	psusi	JonathanEllis	you have a dedicated partition for /boot, or for /boot/grub?
2008-11-19T20:39:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	psusi	I have a dedicated partition for /boot/grub                /boot is on the same partition as /
2008-11-19T20:40:00.000Z	psusi	JonathanEllis	hrm... that's an odd setup... that error message doesn't make sense to me, but I think grub expects to find itself in /boot/grub, or at least /grub... if it's files are in the root of that partition, you might need to create a symlink named grub pointing to .
2008-11-19T20:41:00.000Z	psusi	JonathanEllis	why give /boot/grub its own partition btw?
2008-11-19T20:44:00.000Z	JonathanEllis		﻿psusi: Its a configuration recommended by http://users.bigpond.net.au/hermanzone/p15.htm#How_to_make_a_separate_Grub_Partition_ and http://www.troubleshooters.com/linux/grub/grubpartition.htm#_Why_Dedicate. Its basically because I want to multi boot. Grubs files are in /boot/grub on my grub partition so when that partition is mounted as /boot/grub then grubs files are actually in /boot/grub/boot/grub. I think this is to deal with [quote from psus
2008-11-19T20:45:00.000Z	psusi	JonathanEllis	ahh, when mounted it needs to be in /boot/grub
2008-11-19T20:46:00.000Z	psusi	JonathanEllis	why not put all of /boot on that partition thoguh?
2008-11-19T20:48:00.000Z	JonathanEllis		Oh, but it works perfectly on another machine mounted as /boot/grub/boot/grub. Once the OS has booted, the grub files are not used again anyway so it doesnt even need to be mounted by the operating system - I just mount it for convenience so I can easily edit menu.lst if necessary. The first time I specified root as (hd0,0) because I thought it needed the location of /boot/grub rather than /boot. Here I didnt get this error 23.

2008-11-19T20:49:00.000Z	psusi	JonathanEllis	you only have one hard disk right?
2008-11-19T20:50:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	psusi	I should mention I am doing all this from a livecd to restore grub after a windows install so I  am using grub from a terminal on the livecd. On one machine I have three hard disks - this approach worked fine on that one. The machine I am working on at the moment only has one hd
2008-11-19T20:50:00.000Z	psusi	JonathanEllis	well, it looks odd but I don't see anything wrong... certainly don't see why you would get that error message... unless maybe you typed an upper case o instead of a zero
2008-11-19T20:52:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	psusi	[JonathanEllis strikes himself on the forehead exclaiming Dumkopf!] Its not even an upper case o its a lower case one!
2008-11-19T20:52:00.000Z	psusi		lol
2008-11-19T20:53:00.000Z	psusi		heh, you're right... they are right next to each other...
2008-11-19T20:55:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	psusi	The fingers type fast but the mind needs to check what they are typing! Now it works - only it seems the root statement in the grub terminal interface is actually looking for the partition containing /boot/grub. Makes sense I suppose since the next statement is setup (hd0) - makes sense it wants to know where /boot/grub is so it can setup the hd from there
2008-11-19T20:57:00.000Z	JonathanEllis	psusi	Thanks. Now my laptop is busy booting - just need to add the hated windows entry to menu.lst now. Thats the easy part
