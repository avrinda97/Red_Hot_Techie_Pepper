2006-12-01T15:52:00.000Z	noelferreira		hi people anyone helps me setting up rt61 wireless driver?
2006-12-01T15:53:00.000Z	bitflip	noelferreira	do you have the firmware in /etc/Wireless/RT61STA/* ?
2006-12-01T15:54:00.000Z	bitflip	noelferreira	lsmod | grep rt61 shows it's in use, correct?
2006-12-01T15:56:00.000Z	bitflip	noelferreira	what do you get when iwlist ra0 scan
2006-12-01T15:57:00.000Z	bitflip	noelferreira	is this a stock rt61 driver or from RaLinks website?
2006-12-01T15:58:00.000Z	bitflip	noelferreira	and you have /etc/Wireless/RT61STA/rt61sta.dat configured for your connection, correct?
2006-12-01T16:01:00.000Z	bitflip	noelferreira	you can't use rt61 from RaLink's site *without* that firmware...and to my knowledge ubuntu edgy's rt61 either
2006-12-01T16:01:00.000Z	bitflip	noelferreira	just to be clear, regardless of which rt61 driver you use, you'll need that firmware
2006-12-01T16:02:00.000Z	bitflip	noelferreira	yes
2006-12-01T16:11:00.000Z	bitflip	noelferreira	you have /etc/Wireless/RT61STA/rt61sta.dat configured for your network, rt61 loaded, and ifconfig ra0 up, correct?
2006-12-01T16:12:00.000Z	bitflip	noelferreira	and iwlist ra0 scan says not possible?
2006-12-01T16:13:00.000Z	bitflip	noelferreira	your using edgy?
2006-12-01T16:14:00.000Z	noelferreira	bitflip	dapper
2006-12-01T16:16:00.000Z	bitflip	noelferreira	dapper works with rt61 without issues, it didn't break until edgy
2006-12-01T16:17:00.000Z	bitflip	noelferreira	lspci | grep RaLink - what number does that return?
2006-12-01T16:17:00.000Z	bitflip	noelferreira	there should be a number, like 0302
2006-12-01T16:18:00.000Z	bitflip	noelferreira	is this a laptop?
2006-12-01T16:20:00.000Z	bitflip	noelferreira	not to be unsulting but in the interest of thoroughness, is it turned on hardware wise?
