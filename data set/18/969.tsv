2011-07-18T00:31:00.000Z	Maylow		hello
2011-07-18T00:31:00.000Z	Maylow		I'm having issues with smbnetfs performance
2011-07-18T00:32:00.000Z	Maylow		anyone familiar with this tool?
2011-07-18T00:32:00.000Z	Maylow		i'ts really annoying, given that smbnetfs is slow, while the traditional SAMBA connections work fine
2011-07-18T00:33:00.000Z	e_t_	Maylow	It is better to describe the "issues" you're having in detail.
2011-07-18T00:34:00.000Z	Maylow	e_t_	I can see all PCs in the network, I can access them
2011-07-18T00:34:00.000Z	e_t_	Maylow	That doesn't sound like a problem.
2011-07-18T00:34:00.000Z	Maylow	e_t_	but when I'm browsing shares with deep directory trees, like some windows drives
2011-07-18T00:35:00.000Z	Maylow	e_t_	it's very slow - 30 seconds to list 10 directories
2011-07-18T00:35:00.000Z	Maylow	e_t_	tested with krusader, nautilus and gnome commander - it's the same
2011-07-18T00:36:00.000Z	Maylow	e_t_	on the other hand, using the traditional samba (smb://...) the same shares are listed instantly
2011-07-18T00:36:00.000Z	Maylow	e_t_	does this sound like a problem? :)
2011-07-18T00:37:00.000Z	e_t_	Maylow	I've always gotten better performance from mounting a share via smbfs or cifs than I've ever gotten with a user-space tool.
2011-07-18T00:38:00.000Z	Maylow	e_t_	the performance difference is enormous
2011-07-18T00:38:00.000Z	Maylow	e_t_	could it be some kind of a setting?
2011-07-18T00:41:00.000Z	e_t_	Maylow	My gut reaction is to chalk it up to the difference between user-space and kernel-space (anybody with more knowledge, feel free to correct me). I'd say 'use what works and don't worry about what doesn't.'
2011-07-18T00:43:00.000Z	Maylow	e_t_	smbnetfs is MUCH more convenient than the common samba
2011-07-18T00:44:00.000Z	Maylow	e_t_	anyway...
