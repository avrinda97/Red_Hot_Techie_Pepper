2009-08-06T21:05:00.000Z	mib_mib		hello - can someone help me with a cron job? How do you know what user a CRON job runs as, or set the priviledges?
2009-08-06T21:06:00.000Z	Pici	mib_mib	Whose crontab are you editing? Each user has one (by default in Ubuntu).
2009-08-06T21:06:00.000Z	mib_mib	Pici	i just set a simple crontab, i did crontab -e , the job is */1 * * * * /usr/bin/python /home/me/myscript.py
2009-08-06T21:07:00.000Z	Pici	mib_mib	If you did that as your user, then the script will run as you.  If you wanted it to run as root, then you'd have to do sudo crontab -e
2009-08-06T21:08:00.000Z	mib_mib	Pici	but it isn't running for some reason - here is the script http://pastebin.com/d3cabaed5
2009-08-06T21:10:00.000Z	Pici	mib_mib	Make sure that you are using abolute paths inside the program itself.
2009-08-06T21:10:00.000Z	mib_mib	Pici	ah okay, i just changed it, hopefully that works! shouldn't it get put in SOME folder at least? i just did updatedb and then did locate 'mytest' but it found nothing
2009-08-06T21:11:00.000Z	Pici	mib_mib	Your user may not have rights to wherever the crontab gets run from.

2009-08-06T21:15:00.000Z	mib_mib	Pici	ah okay - i will be setting then /etc/cron.allow
2009-08-06T21:19:00.000Z	mib_mib		How do i give my user permissions to create a crontab? I already created a /etc/cron.allow and added my username on one line - and then i did crontab -e .... can someone help me?
2009-08-06T21:24:00.000Z	mib_mib		i'm trying to write a simple cron job for a python script....but it doesn't seem to be working, can someone give me some pointers? Here is what I have : http://pastebin.com/d2071cebf
2009-08-06T21:27:00.000Z	Pici	mib_mib	Firstly, its cron.allow, not crontab.allow. Secondly, you shouldn't use that file unless you really are locking down crontab to just that user.  Are you running crontab -e as the user django?
2009-08-06T21:27:00.000Z	mib_mib	Pici	yes
2009-08-06T21:28:00.000Z	mib_mib	Pici	ah good catch, so i just made a file that does nothing haha
2009-08-06T21:28:00.000Z	mib_mib	Pici	yet i don't understand why this is not working
2009-08-06T21:30:00.000Z	Pici	mib_mib	Do you want it to run every minute? It should just be * * * * *, not */1 * * * *
