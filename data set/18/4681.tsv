2010-02-14T04:26:00.000Z	FatherTyme		Getting "SystemError: installArchives() failed" when trying to install Nvidia drivers on Karmic...
2010-02-14T04:26:00.000Z	FatherTyme		Has anyone experienced this?
2010-02-14T04:27:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	FatherTyme	from Hardware Drivers or are you using the installer from Nvidia site?
2010-02-14T04:27:00.000Z	FatherTyme		ZykotickK9 - from both jockey-gtk and jockey-text.
2010-02-14T04:29:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	FatherTyme	my initial google search suggests you might want to use an older version of driver, what version are you currently installing?
2010-02-14T04:30:00.000Z	FatherTyme		ZykotickK9 - happens with any driver I try to install - 173,185,190 or 195.

2010-02-14T04:31:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	FatherTyme	what gfx card do you have "lspci | grep -i vga" to find out specifically
2010-02-14T04:32:00.000Z	FatherTyme		ZykotickK9, Geforce 9300 on a Mini-ITX board.

2010-02-14T04:33:00.000Z	FatherTyme	ZykoticK9	The Nvidia binary drivers have previously always worked on this machine.  Just uninstalled 195 to go to 185 to see if I could resolve some screen tearing...
2010-02-14T04:33:00.000Z	FatherTyme	ZykoticK9	But after I uninstalled 195 using jockey, I get that error when trying to install 185.
2010-02-14T04:34:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	FatherTyme	so they were working before the update?
2010-02-14T04:34:00.000Z	FatherTyme	ZykoticK9	Yup.
2010-02-14T04:34:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	FatherTyme	ummm, that complicates matters -- i really don't know what to suggest...
2010-02-14T04:35:00.000Z	FatherTyme	ZykoticK9	It appears to be an issue with jockey, but uninstalling/reinstalling that does not resolve the issue.
2010-02-14T04:36:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	FatherTyme	have you tried "sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx-185" ?
2010-02-14T04:36:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	FatherTyme	and thanks for correcting my nic - highlighting makes a big difference
