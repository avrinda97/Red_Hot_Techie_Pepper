2007-06-14T10:25:00.000Z	a12345		Thanks ubuntu - I can not see any reason why the dummy people prefer to use windows -- as i find ubuntu is much easier for the PC beginners
2007-06-14T10:26:00.000Z	a12345		I would like to report a good side effect after I have been with ubuntu for nearly 3 months
2007-06-14T10:27:00.000Z	a12345		There is no good MySQL tools inside ubuntu -- and because of this -- I build one -- and would like to promote my freebie here :D
2007-06-14T10:27:00.000Z	tritium	a12345	which tools did you not find?
2007-06-14T10:28:00.000Z	tritium	a12345	okay, please don't advertise here
2007-06-14T10:34:00.000Z	tritium	a12345	there are many mysql tools.  You should check the universe and multiverse repositories
2007-06-14T10:37:00.000Z	tritium	a12345	you'd really want to uninstall the package
2007-06-14T10:39:00.000Z	tritium	a12345	if you install it, and want it removed, you uninstall it, rather than deleting sytsem files by hand
2007-06-14T10:40:00.000Z	a12345	tritium	thanks - i also think so -- but actually you can simply delete wine --- sorry i m talking about xbox ? i forgot what virture machine i installed last time -- sorry
2007-06-14T10:40:00.000Z	tritium	a12345	ubuntu uses packages.  While you _can_ delete files, you really should uninstall packages.
2007-06-14T10:42:00.000Z	a12345	tritium	yes i just up one important feed back for ubuntu -- i can not upgrade thunderbird from 1.5 to 2.0
2007-06-14T10:43:00.000Z	a12345	tritium	why the update check is grey in thunderbird and firefox ? dummy like me even do not know how to install a software after download it
2007-06-14T10:44:00.000Z	tritium	a12345	1.5 is the latest version in the feisty repos
2007-06-14T10:47:00.000Z	tritium	a12345	I told you - 1.5 is the latest version there is in the repos
2007-06-14T10:48:00.000Z	tritium	a12345	^^
