2009-08-24T02:56:00.000Z	emyller		lost, the crappy opera browser crashed my connection to webirc
2009-08-24T02:58:00.000Z	emyller		this shouldnt be possible: http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?searchon=contents&keywords=kcm_keyboard.desktop&suite=karmic
2009-08-24T02:58:00.000Z	emyller		-bin depends on -data, but both have the same file :(
2009-08-24T02:58:00.000Z	emyller		now i cant upgrade to the newest -bin. i cant even access my pc graphic interface anymore :(
2009-08-24T02:58:00.000Z	emyller		how can i switch to a previous version?
2009-08-24T02:58:00.000Z	emyller		here's the output of my upgrade attempt: http://emyller.net/output
2009-08-24T02:58:00.000Z	emyller		any thoughts? i'm really needing help :|
2009-08-24T03:00:00.000Z	guntbert	emyller	if you are trying to use kubuntu then you will get better help in  #kubuntu
2009-08-24T03:01:00.000Z	emyller	guntbert	it's not about kubuntu itself, it's about packaging
2009-08-24T03:01:00.000Z	emyller		anyway, i couldnt get help there
2009-08-24T03:02:00.000Z	guntbert	emyller	you see, I assumed that special dependencies between KDE packages are better known there than here....

2009-08-24T03:04:00.000Z	emyller	guntbert	i figured it out. this is why i tried there first then came here :P
2009-08-24T03:05:00.000Z	guntbert	emyller	its ok with me, but I never used KDE on ubuntu - so no help from me either - sorry
2009-08-24T03:07:00.000Z	emyller	guntbert	it seems that it'll save my life: http://shreevatsa.wordpress.com/2006/04/16/dpkg-error-trying-to-overwrite-x-which-is-also-in-package-y/
2009-08-24T03:07:00.000Z	emyller	guntbert	see that it has nothing to do with kde stuff ;)
2009-08-24T03:09:00.000Z	guntbert	emyller	thank you for reporting back - I'll remember that :-)
2009-08-24T03:09:00.000Z	emyller	guntbert	:) gonna try, cya
