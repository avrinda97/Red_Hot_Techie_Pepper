2009-11-30T06:55:00.000Z	mdg	ThePassingShadow	you mean resize?
2009-11-30T07:03:00.000Z	ThePassingShadow	mdg	Sorry for late reply, but htp://up.ppy.sh/files/screenshot-4.png
2009-11-30T07:04:00.000Z	mdg	ThePassingShadow	you wanting to grow sda5?
2009-11-30T07:05:00.000Z	ThePassingShadow	mdg	I'd like to grow sda4 or sda2
2009-11-30T07:06:00.000Z	ThePassingShadow	mdg	Yeah
2009-11-30T07:06:00.000Z	mdg	ThePassingShadow	dual booting?
2009-11-30T07:07:00.000Z	mdg	ThePassingShadow	I don't have experience with resizing windows  - but I would definitely do a backup before you try anything.
2009-11-30T07:08:00.000Z	ThePassingShadow	mdg	I don't know what to try, even if I do
2009-11-30T07:08:00.000Z	mdg	ThePassingShadow	you would want to boot from a live CD to try the resizing - you don't want file systems mounted when you do that
2009-11-30T07:09:00.000Z	ThePassingShadow	mdg	Oh, okay
2009-11-30T07:09:00.000Z	mdg	ThePassingShadow	yes use a live cd - the program Gparted
2009-11-30T07:11:00.000Z	mdg	ThePassingShadow	is windows your default boot - first boot option?
2009-11-30T07:12:00.000Z	mdg	ThePassingShadow	is that the way you want it?
2009-11-30T07:12:00.000Z	mdg	ThePassingShadow	it should be doo-able
2009-11-30T07:13:00.000Z	ThePassingShadow	mdg	How do I do it ?
2009-11-30T07:15:00.000Z	mdg	ThePassingShadow	after you back up your stuff, boot from the live cd and find the app "Gparted" - just like the screen shot.  Then click on the partition you want to work with and you should be able to drap the partition larger or smaller  - it may take some time - usually does.  Once everything looks the way you want, tell gparted to execute the reszining, etc.
2009-11-30T07:16:00.000Z	ThePassingShadow	mdg	Thanks !
