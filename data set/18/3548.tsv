2009-09-16T03:19:00.000Z	sebsebseb	geekgerl	hi
2009-09-16T03:20:00.000Z	sebsebseb	geekgerl	ok  your meant to ask a question first, not  give out a pastebin link first
2009-09-16T03:27:00.000Z	geekgerl	sebsebseb	i only have 9.04 ubuntu boxes right now, so i don't have another distro to test on
2009-09-16T03:21:00.000Z	sebsebseb	geekgerl	What's your issue?  I  may look at your pastebin link later
2009-09-16T03:21:00.000Z	sebsebseb	geekgerl	oh you were Laura?
2009-09-16T03:22:00.000Z	sebsebseb	geekgerl	you didn't spam/food :D

2009-09-16T03:26:00.000Z	sebsebseb	geekgerl	hmm
2009-09-16T03:26:00.000Z	sebsebseb	geekgerl	Your issue isn't distro specific right?
2009-09-16T03:27:00.000Z	geekgerl	sebsebseb	not that i know of
2009-09-16T03:28:00.000Z	sebsebseb	geekgerl	yeah  I don't think it is, which means you could ask in ##linux
2009-09-16T03:28:00.000Z	sebsebseb	geekgerl	well even Ubuntu stuff could be asked in there, but really this is the channal for that
2009-09-16T03:28:00.000Z	geekgerl	sebsebseb	ok, thanks, i'll try there!
2009-09-16T03:29:00.000Z	sebsebseb	geekgerl	I even asked some IRC friends of mine  if they could help you, but I guess not
2009-09-16T03:30:00.000Z	sebsebseb	geekgerl	good luck, altough I am not even sure what your trying to do exactly
2009-09-16T03:31:00.000Z	geekgerl	sebsebseb	thanks for all the suggestions. i'm trying to get a network-based remote setup for mythtv. long story. i'll check out #linux and #mythtv to see if if anyone knows there. thank you!
2009-09-16T03:31:00.000Z	sebsebseb	geekgerl	ok no problem :)
