2005-06-13T09:01:00.000Z	dr_willis		closed captioning seems to be different from subtitles.
2005-06-13T09:03:00.000Z	IcemanV9	dr_willis	yes it is. it covered more than subtitle.
2005-06-13T09:04:00.000Z	dr_willis	IcemanV9	 yea - thise shows i recorded show the CC logo. but cant seem to get CC working.
2005-06-13T09:05:00.000Z	IcemanV9	dr_willis	record the show on what? vcr? pc?
2005-06-13T09:06:00.000Z	dr_willis	IcemanV9	 a HardDrive-VCR kind of thing. :P i recall seeing the optins to enable CC. but either my players are ignoreing that.. or.. Hmm perhaps i need to enable CC showing on the tv.. and the recorder
2005-06-13T09:06:00.000Z	IcemanV9	dr_willis	if it's vcr, then adjust the speed a little bit.
2005-06-13T09:06:00.000Z	IcemanV9	dr_willis	yes. it has to be enabled in order to read CC
2005-06-13T09:07:00.000Z	IcemanV9	dr_willis	no. on the tv. not the dvd player.
2005-06-13T09:07:00.000Z	dr_willis	IcemanV9	 i got a portable dvd player with lcd also. :P wanting it to work there mainly
2005-06-13T09:08:00.000Z	IcemanV9	dr_willis	oh! ok. hmm. dunno about that one.
