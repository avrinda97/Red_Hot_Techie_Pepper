2007-10-27T08:24:00.000Z	gnurph69		How can I X into another Ubuntu box from my main one, can somebody point the way?
2007-10-27T08:25:00.000Z	deeproot	gnurph69	have you tried VNC
2007-10-27T08:26:00.000Z	gnurph69	deeproot	yes, but I was hoping to use xcmdp (or whatever it's called)
2007-10-27T08:30:00.000Z	deeproot	gnurph69	i'm sorry but i've only used vnc and just logged in while another user is already logged, but i think you may look in to x11 forwarding
2007-10-27T08:31:00.000Z	gnurph69	deeproot	then I'll just keep on looking.  thank you.
2007-10-27T09:02:00.000Z	deeproot	gnurph69	do you want vncserver to run all the time on the server
2007-10-27T09:02:00.000Z	gnurph69	deeproot	no.
2007-10-27T09:02:00.000Z	gnurph69	deeproot	actually, I think it's running - but i'm unable to connect to it.  I have turned off the firewall.
2007-10-27T09:03:00.000Z	gnurph69	deeproot	yes.
2007-10-27T09:03:00.000Z	gnurph69	deeproot	I'm getting "unable to connect to hose:  connection refused (111)"
2007-10-27T09:04:00.000Z	deeproot	gnurph69	how did you turn on vnc
2007-10-27T09:04:00.000Z	gnurph69	deeproot	I installed it with apt-get install vncserver
2007-10-27T09:04:00.000Z	gnurph69	deeproot	then I started it with vncserver
2007-10-27T09:05:00.000Z	gnurph69	deeproot	I get an error on start:  "xauth:  (argv):1: bad display name .. blah blah blah
2007-10-27T09:05:00.000Z	gnurph69	deeproot	yes, I'm usign xvncviewer 192.blahblah
2007-10-27T09:08:00.000Z	gnurph69	deeproot	I don't need some BS port forwarding on my side (client) to make this work, do I?
2007-10-27T09:09:00.000Z	deeproot	gnurph69	you dont need any firewall port forwarding if you are are the same network as the vnc server
2007-10-27T09:12:00.000Z	gnurph69	deeproot	okay, let's try again.
