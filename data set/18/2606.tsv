2010-04-07T08:46:00.000Z	Guest97866		hi, I'm new to Ubuntu. I installed today. But I don;t know how to install the driver. I downloaded the package. Its a zip file. Can any one tell me please how to install the driver.
2010-04-07T08:47:00.000Z	arand	Guest97866	What driver, what is inside the zip file if you extract it?
2010-04-07T08:48:00.000Z	Guest97866	arand	Yes I extracted.
2010-04-07T08:48:00.000Z	Guest97866	arand	now Its showing like realtek-linux-audiopack-4.06x.tar.bz2
2010-04-07T08:49:00.000Z	arand	Guest97866	That's also an archived file, extract again ;)
2010-04-07T08:49:00.000Z	Guest97866	arand	and a folder is also displaying "RHEL5"
2010-04-07T08:49:00.000Z	Guest97866	arand	ok
2010-04-07T08:50:00.000Z	Guest97866	arand	now I got the Install file. I run that file with terminal. Is this right?
2010-04-07T08:50:00.000Z	arand	Guest97866	But Normally if you get to the stage of a driver coming in an archive, something is wrong, and there is normally a better way to do things...
2010-04-07T08:51:00.000Z	arand	Guest97866	.rpm, .deb, or .bin?
2010-04-07T08:52:00.000Z	Guest97866	arand	that was not showing any ext. only Install is written over there.
2010-04-07T08:53:00.000Z	arand	Guest97866	hm, if executed via bash, it might work, but I would look otherwere for a solution still, since installing separate drivers like that, normally is not the way things go...
2010-04-07T08:54:00.000Z	Guest97866	arand	Chelz: Its showing the folder FC6, Mandriva2007.1, Redhat4.4 Suse10.1 and nothing else
2010-04-07T08:55:00.000Z	arand	Guest97866	Probably none, since none of those distributions use the same ackages as ubuntu.
2010-04-07T08:57:00.000Z	Guest97866	arand	on the site of Asus only these drivers are provided. Then what I do for Ubuntu?
2010-04-07T08:57:00.000Z	Guest97866	arand	Motherboard name is P5SD2-VM
2010-04-07T09:00:00.000Z	Guest97866	arand	chelz: are you having any solution for me?
