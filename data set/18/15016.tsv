2005-05-18T09:57:00.000Z	crimsun	JoeXCoolNJ	it works fine
2005-05-18T09:58:00.000Z	JoeXCoolNJ	crimsun	it's working fine booted to the live cd, but not when I boot to the hdd. any idea where I should start looking?
2005-05-18T09:59:00.000Z	crimsun	JoeXCoolNJ	/var/log/Xorg.0.log
2005-05-18T10:07:00.000Z	crimsun	JoeXCoolNJ	please paste your /var/log/Xorg.0.log onto http://pastebin.com
2005-05-18T10:10:00.000Z	JoeXCoolNJ	crimsun	done
2005-05-18T10:13:00.000Z	crimsun	JoeXCoolNJ	but there are errors
2005-05-18T10:13:00.000Z	crimsun	JoeXCoolNJ	look at lines 779-787 of your paste
2005-05-18T10:16:00.000Z	crimsun	JoeXCoolNJ	is your touchpad enabled in bios?
2005-05-18T10:18:00.000Z	crimsun	JoeXCoolNJ	do you have legacy mouse emulation enabled in bios?
2005-05-18T10:19:00.000Z	crimsun	JoeXCoolNJ	not even PnP OS?
2005-05-18T10:19:00.000Z	crimsun	JoeXCoolNJ	correct, "no"
2005-05-18T10:22:00.000Z	JoeXCoolNJ	crimsun	nothing at all. just 3 lines about pc speaker
2005-05-18T10:23:00.000Z	crimsun	JoeXCoolNJ	ok, take a look at http://web.telia.com/~u89404340/touchpad/trouble-shooting.txt then
2005-05-18T10:37:00.000Z	JoeXCoolNJ	crimsun	there's not even a PNP option. But I'm certain it's not hardware, because like I said, the touchpad works with the Live CD
2005-05-18T10:37:00.000Z	crimsun	JoeXCoolNJ	did you take a look at the hints on the troubleshooting guide?
2005-05-18T10:53:00.000Z	JoeXCoolNJ	crimsun	you have a win.
2005-05-18T10:54:00.000Z	crimsun	JoeXCoolNJ	excellent.
