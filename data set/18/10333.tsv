2006-12-17T09:22:00.000Z	Henning		question
2006-12-17T09:23:00.000Z	Henning		how do i change the screen resolution to 1280 by 1024 in the LIVE cd?
2006-12-17T09:23:00.000Z	orasis	Henning	Preferences screen resolution - but you may not be able to do it - since of course the LIVE CD, is running off deafault.. "Safe" drivers.
2006-12-17T09:24:00.000Z	Henning	orasis	is there any....terminal way to change it?
2006-12-17T09:24:00.000Z	orasis	Henning	No unless it's actually installed.. you cannot really modify XORG on a read only media..
2006-12-17T09:24:00.000Z	orasis	Henning	You would need to burn your own copy, and basically rewrite the xorg.conf file with the best drivers :)
2006-12-17T09:25:00.000Z	orasis	Henning	Well of course not - A cd is read only, and of course the whole "LIVE" part takes place in ram.. so umm yeah.
2006-12-17T09:26:00.000Z	orasis	Henning	After you install PROPER video drivers - you click "system -> preferences -> screen resolution" :)
2006-12-17T09:27:00.000Z	orasis	Henning	You get the fglrx drivers from synaptic :)
2006-12-17T09:28:00.000Z	orasis	Henning	Well you will have to change drivers thats about it hah
2006-12-17T09:29:00.000Z	orasis	Henning	Naw you'd be sent back to console thats all.
2006-12-17T09:29:00.000Z	orasis	Henning	If you want to play it safe with minimal problems until you get the feel - just put "radeon" as your driver.
2006-12-17T09:30:00.000Z	orasis	Henning	Open /etc/X11/xorg - find the "device" section, and rather then "ati" -- replace it with "radeon" -- ctrl-alt-backspace, finito.
2006-12-17T09:31:00.000Z	orasis	Henning	Good luck with the sound :P
2006-12-17T09:31:00.000Z	Henning	orasis	that's why i deinstalled xubuntu
2006-12-17T09:32:00.000Z	orasis	Henning	Naw you can get it working, but you'll probably have to modify your own stuff
2006-12-17T09:32:00.000Z	Henning	orasis	i would call myself "computer-savvy" but when it comes to linux, i'm a total newbie
2006-12-17T09:33:00.000Z	orasis	Henning	Everyone does.. ;D
