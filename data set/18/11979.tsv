2007-05-13T14:07:00.000Z	dakira		Did anyone here succeed in installing the latest nvidia beta drivers in feisty? the resulting kernel module just doesn't load here ;( amd my card is only supported by the latest beta..
2007-05-13T14:08:00.000Z	stefg	dakira	what error do you get ?
2007-05-13T14:09:00.000Z	dakira	stefg	modprobe gives me this: FATAL: Error running install command for nvidia
2007-05-13T14:10:00.000Z	stefg	dakira	sudo depmod -ae ?
2007-05-13T14:10:00.000Z	dakira	stefg	yep.. did that.. and modprobe -l does show it
2007-05-13T14:10:00.000Z	stefg	dakira	soething like api-mismatch ?
2007-05-13T14:11:00.000Z	dakira	stefg	nope.. that only happens if you leave nvidia-kernel-common installed.. i removed that (including restricted drivers)
2007-05-13T14:12:00.000Z	dakira	stefg	but indeed I did have the api mismatch error when i left the old kernel module installed and just blacklisted it
2007-05-13T14:12:00.000Z	stefg	dakira	the nvidia-installer leaves a build-log ... any clues in there?
2007-05-13T14:13:00.000Z	dakira	stefg	haven't checked.. I should maybe have a look ;) but the installer and module-linking went through smoothly (no errors)
2007-05-13T14:15:00.000Z	dakira	stefg	err.. any idea where die nvidia installer leaves its logfile?
2007-05-13T14:18:00.000Z	dakira	stefg	hmm.. I'll check it out later.. the current log there is the log from the last uninstall process which of course doesn't give me any clues.. and since i'm running X now i can't run the installer ;) thx anyway for pointing me to the logfile!
2007-05-13T14:19:00.000Z	stefg	dakira	i'd uninstall the whole kaboodle... all packages from the repos. search through the installer-archive for the source and then see if module-assistant  does a better job
2007-05-13T14:21:00.000Z	dakira	stefg	i've done the uninstalling part already ;) i guess with the installer archive you mean the .sh file, right?
2007-05-13T14:21:00.000Z	stefg	dakira	right
2007-05-13T14:21:00.000Z	dakira	stefg	okay.. good point.. I will do that, too if the logfile leaves no clues.. thx for your help
2007-05-13T14:21:00.000Z	stefg	dakira	iirc it has an --unpack option
2007-05-13T14:22:00.000Z	dakira	stefg	ah.. good to know..
