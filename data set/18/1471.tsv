2011-02-21T01:25:00.000Z	simisu		do i need to manually assign a swap partition? in the instalation it didn´t ask me anything about that...
2011-02-21T01:27:00.000Z	simisu		yes
2011-02-21T01:28:00.000Z	simisu		thing is i´m finding the fresh ubuntu install much slower then the windows... could it be because it´s running from an external HDD with usb2?
2011-02-21T01:30:00.000Z	simisu		thing is i´m finding the fresh ubuntu install much slower then the windows... could it be because it´s running from an external HDD with usb2?
2011-02-21T01:32:00.000Z	simisu		but would that make a difference in webbrowsing or more heavy stuff... if it´s like that i might have to actually install it on the computer (although all i have are about 6 gigs... not much to go with no?)
2011-02-21T01:33:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	simisu	what would make a difference?
2011-02-21T01:35:00.000Z	simisu	aeon-ltd	i´m guessing if i ran ubuntu from the sata harddrive and not the external HDD it would be faster no? (not having to work through usb)
2011-02-21T01:37:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	simisu	yes, read and write speeds would be much faster, but once an apllication that doesn't require much r/w, its all in the ram and thats the same
2011-02-21T01:37:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	simisu	what specification is your pc?
2011-02-21T01:39:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	simisu	then the ram's the limit, and i'm assuming integrated gpu
2011-02-21T01:39:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	simisu	still i'd opt in to a lighter window manager or desktop environment like xfce/lxde
2011-02-21T01:43:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	simisu	different constraints, depending on software something can seem fast or slow, gnome is pretty fat to be honest, i mean just by viewing (no actual scientific recordings) a pentium 3 could seem faster than a i5 just by changing the software - gnome with compiz is more like vista with full effects, gnome with metacity without the effects and the performance difference for 99% of machines is insane
2011-02-21T01:44:00.000Z	simisu	aeon-ltd	to be quite honest i can´t follow you...
2011-02-21T01:47:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	simisu	ok, lesson/philosophy, the software is almost always the problem - better written (those who aim for the least amount of lines of code for a function) software can perform better on the same system than with poorly written code. in this case its usage of software thats the problem - right now you use gnome(stock ubuntu desktop) which is heavy if you use xubuntu (different software, same core) it will seem faster
2011-02-21T01:47:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	simisu	as well as be faster/lighter on your hardware
2011-02-21T01:48:00.000Z	simisu	aeon-ltd	so what you´re telling me is to try a different distro? name Xubunto for example?
2011-02-21T01:49:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	simisu	yes, but you don't have to reinstall, you can just remove the gnome stuff and install xubuntu packages. btw google around for other window managers/ desktop environments you might like that are light; personally i'd choose lxde
2011-02-21T02:05:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	simisu	ok, my best suggestion if you have 1 hour, is to start from server or use a lighter distro
