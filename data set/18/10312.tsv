2006-12-20T07:31:00.000Z	cdevidal	un_operateur	;-P

2006-12-20T07:32:00.000Z	un_operateur	cdevidal	if you intend of losing your hair before the age of 40, you're welcome to try anything out :)
2006-12-20T07:32:00.000Z	cdevidal	un_operateur	I'd like to try this out if you please
2006-12-20T07:32:00.000Z	cdevidal		please ls -l /dev/hdc and paste it in here
2006-12-20T07:33:00.000Z	un_operateur	cdevidal	seriously -- there's no point to it -- but anyway -- brw-rw---- 1 root disk 22, 0 2006-12-19 02:17 /dev/hdc
2006-12-20T07:33:00.000Z	cdevidal	un_operateur	thanks for your concern, and thanks for the ls, already tried 22, 0 so I must have another problem, just wanted someone else to confirm that's the proper setting.  Thanks.
2006-12-20T07:34:00.000Z	un_operateur	cdevidal	22,0 -- are you talking about device IDs ?
2006-12-20T07:34:00.000Z	cdevidal	un_operateur	yep
