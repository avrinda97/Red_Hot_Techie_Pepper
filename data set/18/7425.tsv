2008-05-22T23:46:00.000Z	Ronald		doesn anybody know where the package for flashplugin nonfree of version 10 beta is hanging out? launchpad bugtracker says its been released somewhere by Daniel T Chen...
2008-05-22T23:48:00.000Z	zionpsyfer	Ronald	Try Adobe, they are the ones who released it.
2008-05-22T23:49:00.000Z	Ronald	zionpsyfer	thats no answer
2008-05-22T23:49:00.000Z	zionpsyfer	Ronald	Google disagrees. http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/flashplayer10.html
2008-05-22T23:49:00.000Z	Ronald	zionpsyfer	you say the launchpad janitor lies ?
2008-05-22T23:50:00.000Z	Ronald	zionpsyfer	https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/pulseaudio/+bug/192888/comments/197
2008-05-22T23:51:00.000Z	zionpsyfer	Ronald	That does not mean that 10 has hit the repositories yet.  That means a bug has been confirmed fixed in 10
2008-05-22T23:52:00.000Z	zionpsyfer	Ronald	Indeed. And having a package version number doesn't imply it's in the main repos.  It will be released eventually.  If you need it now, adobe allows you to download it.
2008-05-22T23:53:00.000Z	Ronald	zionpsyfer	well i say its rather obvious I prefer a packaged version
2008-05-22T23:54:00.000Z	zionpsyfer	Ronald	So what is your question then?  No it is not available yet as is quite obvious by searching the repos and looking at the plugin version.
2008-05-22T23:54:00.000Z	Ronald	zionpsyfer	i assumed it was out somewhere
2008-05-22T23:55:00.000Z	zionpsyfer	Ronald	It is, in the intrepid repositories.  https://code.launchpad.net/ubuntu/intrepid/+source/flashplugin-nonfree/10.0.1.218ubuntu1
2008-05-22T23:56:00.000Z	Ronald	zionpsyfer	ty, thats what i wanted to know and couldn't find using google
2008-05-22T23:57:00.000Z	zionpsyfer	Ronald	You're on hardy I assume?  I'd be surprised if it took very long to show up in the repos.  Fairly popular and high demand package for us end users.
2008-05-22T23:58:00.000Z	Ronald	zionpsyfer	its a beta ;) i'd say soso. flash 9 is a bi*** but 10 is beta
2008-05-22T23:59:00.000Z	zionpsyfer	Ronald	Agreed.  Here's hoping the beta works wonderfully and we can forget about the mess that is/was 9.
2008-05-23T00:00:00.000Z	Ronald	zionpsyfer	the meta-ish package build, but it seems i need to pull updated libflashsupport and libasound2-plugins too
2008-05-23T00:33:00.000Z	Ronald	zionpsyfer	got hardy packags build from the intrepid source-packages. all installed now. thanks for the pointers.
