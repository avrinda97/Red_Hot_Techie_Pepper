2004-11-09T14:15:00.000Z	utis		Right now I'd love to know why I can't put anything into my ~/.Xsession ...
2004-11-09T14:17:00.000Z	utis		But I would have expected to find something in the network configuration program in the Gnome panel.
2004-11-09T14:18:00.000Z	utis		When I didn't find it there, I sighed and fetched a few HOWTOs from tldp.org.
2004-11-09T14:18:00.000Z	utis		I think that Ubuntu should put it into a more prominent place.  DSL over PPP is quite common these days.
2004-11-09T14:19:00.000Z	utis		I want to shadow the path for the Gnome panels, application launchers etc., too.
2004-11-09T14:21:00.000Z	utis		While I am at it: I have another minor quirk (which I already solved):
2004-11-09T14:22:00.000Z	utis		I understand why they "disable" root. But instead they should just give it the same password as the default user.
2004-11-09T14:23:00.000Z	utis		I did something wrong with my network stuff when installing. So that the name I gave to my computer was not resolved to 127.0.0.1
2004-11-09T14:23:00.000Z	utis		This had the effect that Gnome did not work properly:  I could not get a root shell, for instance.
2004-11-09T14:24:00.000Z	utis		So I had to reboot in the "protected mode" in order to fix my problem.
2004-11-09T14:24:00.000Z	spiv	utis	You know about sudo?
2004-11-09T14:25:00.000Z	utis	spiv	I do.  But I missed that I can use it with my normal password.  Besides that I am not sure anymore whether I was able to get a terminal at all.
2004-11-09T14:26:00.000Z	spiv	utis	Sure you could.  Applications -> System Tools -> Root Terminal.
2004-11-09T14:27:00.000Z	spiv	utis	Like other things that require root, it prompts you for your password.
2004-11-09T14:28:00.000Z	spiv	utis	Intriguing, I haven't heard of a bug like that before.  I don't suppose you know enough details to reproduce it and/or file a bug report?
2004-11-09T14:29:00.000Z	spiv	utis	Did it give you any error messages?
2004-11-09T14:29:00.000Z	utis	spiv	only when logging in: that Gnome could not resolve the name I gave to my machine. (That problem is already fixed.)
2004-11-09T14:30:00.000Z	spiv	utis	What about running sudo from the command line?
