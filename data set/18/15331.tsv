2008-02-01T17:05:00.000Z	Myiasia		Yup.
2008-02-01T17:06:00.000Z	Myiasia		Oh, huh.. I thought the generic kernel was i386. At least, that's what the package manager would lead me to believe.
2008-02-01T17:07:00.000Z	Myiasia		Dur.. can't believe I forgot about uname.
2008-02-01T17:07:00.000Z	Myiasia		That's what I get for being a blonde. XP
2008-02-01T17:08:00.000Z	Myiasia		i686, sure enough.
2008-02-01T17:08:00.000Z	Myiasia		hehe
2008-02-01T17:09:00.000Z	Myiasia		One of my friends got me hooked on Linux back in '03, and since then, I've played with .. gods, 7 different flavors.
2008-02-01T17:10:00.000Z	Myiasia		So far, Ubuntu is my favorite, and I've only been toying with it for about 6 months, now. :p
2008-02-01T17:11:00.000Z	Myiasia		And some minor gaming. Most intense game I run is UT2004, and it runs natively in Linux, so..
2008-02-01T17:12:00.000Z	Myiasia		I've heard Fluxbox is pretty good.
2008-02-01T17:13:00.000Z	mopflite	Myiasia	fluxbox is good, and has a light footprint too - ideal for running on older machines
2008-02-01T17:13:00.000Z	mopflite	Myiasia	yes
2008-02-01T17:15:00.000Z	mopflite	Myiasia	you might also want to apt-get install fluxconf which is an easy configuration tool - fluxbox is a little non-intuitive to configure for a newcomer, and iirc the standard ubuntu packaged version doesn't come with much in the way of a pre-written configuration file
2008-02-01T17:16:00.000Z	mopflite	Myiasia	it's much more minimalist than either KDE or gnome, and as a result much faster

2008-02-01T17:19:00.000Z	mopflite	Myiasia	you've got me thinking now, I might install and try enlightenment
2008-02-01T17:19:00.000Z	mopflite	Myiasia	menus are possible and very configurable
2008-02-01T17:21:00.000Z	mopflite	Myiasia	http://www.yoyo.org/~anthony/blackbox-menu # that's the blackbox menu config file syntax, fluxbox is very similar
