2011-09-19T10:28:00.000Z	ninwa		Hey guys, this would be the first time I've installed ubuntu while an existing Windows installation was there. Can I expect a pretty smooth experience for side-by-side?
2011-09-19T10:28:00.000Z	ninwa		I think this has improved hugely and was wondering if it was mostly painless now with the ubuntu installer.
2011-09-19T10:29:00.000Z	ninwa		I want to install it beside my Windows installation, which is currently the full partition. My understanding is the installer will resize the partition (I hope?) :)
2011-09-19T10:29:00.000Z	ninwa		the full hd, single partition*
2011-09-19T10:30:00.000Z	urlin2u	ninwa	do you know how many partitions you have now on the HD?
2011-09-19T10:30:00.000Z	ninwa	urlin2u	just one with Windows
2011-09-19T10:30:00.000Z	urlin2u	ninwa	did you install it yourself?
2011-09-19T10:30:00.000Z	ninwa	urlin2u	yes, I built the computer :) no system restore partition or anything like that
2011-09-19T10:31:00.000Z	urlin2u	ninwa	no boot paretition?
2011-09-19T10:32:00.000Z	ninwa	urlin2u	maybe I learn something today :) I did the installation myself, but I'll be honest I never knew there was a need for a "boot partition" I thought that the boot record was sort of this mysterious thing hidden at the beginning of the HD but was "some other thing"
2011-09-19T10:33:00.000Z	urlin2u	ninwa	there is a need for one but if you let the windows autoinstall at least with W7 it makes one.
2011-09-19T10:33:00.000Z	urlin2u	ninwa	no need I meant
2011-09-19T10:33:00.000Z	ninwa	urlin2u	it created one it seems
2011-09-19T10:36:00.000Z	urlin2u	ninwa	 asked about the amount, I ssupect you know already the limitations of primaries 4 to a HD, ubuntu will go to a extended and boot, so 3 primaries and a extended, with logicals inside I build them ahead of time in gparted, and use the something else option to get the ubuntu in a premade logical.
2011-09-19T10:37:00.000Z	urlin2u	ninwa	I guess the side by side works fine, you are subject to the immovable paging files in windows so be prudent.
2011-09-19T10:39:00.000Z	ninwa	urlin2u	ps: the windows disk management tool was well aware of this and is currently shrinking my partition to half
2011-09-19T10:41:00.000Z	urlin2u	ninwa	cool the W7 virtual partitioner saves a few lives I will bet. :D
