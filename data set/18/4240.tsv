2009-06-16T03:16:00.000Z	Arquis_Br	behappy	maybe you don't have the permissions? Had to fix mine once to mount. Look its properties / permissions.
2009-06-16T03:17:00.000Z	behappy	Arquis_Br	I am root and / had permission drwxr-xr-x
2009-06-16T03:21:00.000Z	Arquis_Br		Behappy: what's the filesystem?
2009-06-16T03:22:00.000Z	behappy	Arquis_Br	ext3
2009-06-16T03:28:00.000Z	Arquis_Br		Behappy: try gksudo nautilus on terminal and mount it if possible. If it works it's a permission problem. If not, i can't remenber what I did. I'm quite a noob with the CLI and permissions. :(
2009-06-16T03:29:00.000Z	behappy	Arquis_Br	how to use gksudo ?
2009-06-16T03:29:00.000Z	Arquis_Br		Behappy: last time Google saved my ass (my problem was permissions).
2009-06-16T03:30:00.000Z	Arquis_Br	behappy	press ALT+f2
2009-06-16T03:30:00.000Z	Arquis_Br		heheh
2009-06-16T03:30:00.000Z	behappy	Arquis_Br	I can mount other partitions
2009-06-16T03:31:00.000Z	Arquis_Br	behappy	after the gksudo?
2009-06-16T03:31:00.000Z	behappy	Arquis_Br	no before
2009-06-16T03:33:00.000Z	Arquis_Br	behappy	so what's the problem exactly? I thought you said you couldn't mount it ?...
2009-06-16T03:34:00.000Z	behappy	Arquis_Br	just this one
2009-06-16T03:34:00.000Z	behappy	Arquis_Br	mount: /dev/sdb2 already mounted or /backup/
2009-06-16T03:34:00.000Z	Arquis_Br	behappy	and after the gksudo nautilus it still does not mount?
2009-06-16T03:36:00.000Z	Arquis_Br	behappy	with me was the same. Everything mounting except one hd with ext3. Not sure what you mean now. Maybe somebody else can help. Post the problem again.
