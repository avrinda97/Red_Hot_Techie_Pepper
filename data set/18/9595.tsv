2007-09-18T06:06:00.000Z	devtrash		Has any succesfully used a Haupauge PVR350 + lirc + IRBlaster + Scientific Atlantic 2200?  Or does someone  know where there are some instrustions on doing so?
2007-09-18T06:07:00.000Z	wastrel	devtrash	 i have that box, i couldn't get irblaster working on it
2007-09-18T06:07:00.000Z	wastrel	devtrash	 gl :] 
2007-09-18T06:07:00.000Z	devtrash	wastrel	what troubles did you run into?
2007-09-18T06:08:00.000Z	wastrel	devtrash	 never could get the irblaster to do anything to the cable box
2007-09-18T06:08:00.000Z	devtrash	wastrel	argh.  Did you ever get anything working?  Another type of blaster perhaps?
2007-09-18T06:08:00.000Z	wastrel	devtrash	 i could see the IR with digital cam, it would blink, but no config i tried would make the box do anything.
2007-09-18T06:09:00.000Z	wastrel	devtrash	 i got the card capture working, and i could record, but i'd have to manually change channels on the box.
2007-09-18T06:09:00.000Z	devtrash	wastrel	yeah that's where I am with it as well.
2007-09-18T06:10:00.000Z	wastrel	devtrash	 if you have ir capture on your linux box, you can try recording directly from your remote
2007-09-18T06:11:00.000Z	wastrel	devtrash	 that was going to be my next project but we got the tivo instead and scrapped it :] 
2007-09-18T06:11:00.000Z	devtrash	wastrel	you mean the cable provied remote or the PVR350 remote?
2007-09-18T06:12:00.000Z	wastrel	devtrash	 you use a program that records the keys from the cable box remote
2007-09-18T06:12:00.000Z	devtrash	wastrel	irrecord right?
2007-09-18T06:18:00.000Z	wastrel	devtrash	 yeah irrecord.
2007-09-18T06:19:00.000Z	devtrash	wastrel	ok thanks
2007-09-18T06:32:00.000Z	devtrash	wastrel	holy crap!  when I run irw I get output
2007-09-18T06:49:00.000Z	devtrash	wastrel	I'm a step closer.irsend now says my hardware doesn't support transmit.
