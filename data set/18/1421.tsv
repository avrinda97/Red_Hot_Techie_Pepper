2011-02-24T10:33:00.000Z	Nacht_		just searched for xorg.conf and came up empty. Anyone have any ideas on how to get the gui worknig after the nvidia drivers have rendered my nvidia 6 series gpu useless?
2011-02-24T10:34:00.000Z	tucemiux	Nacht_	yeah there should be a thread somewhere either in the forums or on the web, did your machine get hosed after an update?
2011-02-24T10:36:00.000Z	Nacht_	tucemiux	searched the forums already and tried the advice I could find. didn't work. And no, my machine was hosed form a fresh cd install...
2011-02-24T10:36:00.000Z	tucemiux	Nacht_	 what version of ubuntu youre trying and what type of machine you have: brand/model
2011-02-24T10:38:00.000Z	Nacht_	tucemiux	using 10.10 with an HP media center m8100n. The thing ran 9.10 like a champ before I had to install XP for business...
2011-02-24T10:40:00.000Z	tucemiux	Nacht_	seems like it's a known issue, what video card do you have?
2011-02-24T10:41:00.000Z	Nacht_	tucemiux	using an nvidia geforce 6100 SE nforce 430
2011-02-24T10:41:00.000Z	Nacht_		tucemix, it's listed in the supported products under the driver listing on the nvidia website
2011-02-24T10:42:00.000Z	tucemiux	Nacht_	you can get into a terminal?
2011-02-24T10:43:00.000Z	Nacht_	tucemiux	in the terminal on the offending machine now.
2011-02-24T10:43:00.000Z	tucemiux	Nacht_	 try reconfiguring x
2011-02-24T10:44:00.000Z	Nacht_	tucemiux	i'm not exactly a terminal wizard... what command would I use to do that.
2011-02-24T10:44:00.000Z	tucemiux	Nacht_	basically -- youre going to reconfigure X so that you have a GUI -- then you install the nVidia drivers: http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/ubuntu-linux-how-to-reconfigure-x-windows-system-xorg-server/
2011-02-24T10:45:00.000Z	Nacht_	tucemiux	thanks I'll try that
2011-02-24T10:45:00.000Z	tucemiux	Nacht_	no problem, good night!
2011-02-24T10:47:00.000Z	Nacht_	tucemiux	just tried it. No response. The on screen prompts that should have showed up didn't. Kinda strange...
2011-02-24T10:50:00.000Z	tucemiux	Nacht_	 you mean you tried reconfiguring X?? Or you cant get into a terminal?
2011-02-24T10:51:00.000Z	Nacht_	tucemiux	tried to reconfigure x.
