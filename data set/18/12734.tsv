2006-11-16T13:20:00.000Z	kitche	we2by	eclipse
2006-11-16T13:21:00.000Z	we2by	kitche	cmd not found
2006-11-16T13:25:00.000Z	kitche	we2by	you have to change to whee you put eclipse then run ./eclipse
2006-11-16T13:25:00.000Z	kitche	we2by	since you installed it in ~/Eclipse it's probably not in your path
2006-11-16T13:25:00.000Z	we2by	kitche	the install went through apt-get
2006-11-16T13:26:00.000Z	kitche	we2by	ok then it's should be eclipse since that's how it's started unless you didn't get some of the packages
2006-11-21T16:57:00.000Z	kitche	we2by	jaws: gnome-xchat and xchat is the same program just that gnome-xchat is xchat with gnome theme I believe
2006-11-21T16:57:00.000Z	we2by	kitche	nope
2006-11-21T16:57:00.000Z	we2by	kitche	I think the gnome-xchat uses the xchat engine
2006-12-08T17:14:00.000Z	kitche	we2by	I have no clue about uuid's
2006-12-08T17:15:00.000Z	we2by	kitche	I only want to mount my windows partition so I can read it on Ubuntu
2006-12-08T17:16:00.000Z	kitche	we2by	try just mounting the partition that windows is on
2006-12-08T17:16:00.000Z	we2by	kitche	I can do that with sudo but then only root can read it
2006-12-08T17:17:00.000Z	kitche	we2by	when you mount you have to use umask it's mount <partition> <mount point> umask=(uid) I believe
2006-12-08T17:20:00.000Z	kitche	we2by	so your user can read it now? but anyways a user usualyl can read a partiton by defualt just needs the umask to write to it
2006-12-11T06:16:00.000Z	kitche	we2by	did you turn off ipv6 already?
2006-12-11T06:16:00.000Z	we2by	kitche	dunno, never did that
