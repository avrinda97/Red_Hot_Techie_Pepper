2010-08-31T13:35:00.000Z	Panic		Hi. After googling and asking friends, I've had to give up and come here to seek help: How is sshd started during reboot on 10.04 LTS? I can't find any symlinks in the rc directories, and all I've found online about the "new init" just tells you how to start and stop manually, not how it's determined if ssh will be brought up automagically on reboot... Any pointers would be most welcome :-)
2010-08-31T13:36:00.000Z	Panic		Yes. I'd like that :-) But how can I check that it actually will be? This is a server half way around the globe, so I want to make sure ssh actually IS brought up when I reboot it :-)
2010-08-31T13:36:00.000Z	pLr	Panic	it will start automatically when you install openssh-server
2010-08-31T13:37:00.000Z	pLr	Panic	it is listed in /etc/init.d/ and can be looked up with the service command
2010-08-31T13:45:00.000Z	pLr	Panic	/etc/rc* still exists
2010-08-31T13:46:00.000Z	pLr	Panic	i would suggest editing /etc/ssh/sshd_config before your reboot
2010-08-31T13:47:00.000Z	pLr	Panic	and testing it
2010-08-31T13:51:00.000Z	pLr	Panic	the install of openssh-server would be unsuccessful for u to have a prob
2010-08-31T13:52:00.000Z	pLr	Panic	/etc/init/ssh.conf has information you might be seeking
2010-08-31T13:52:00.000Z	pLr	Panic	i would suggest you dont panic Panic :p
2010-08-31T13:53:00.000Z	pLr	Panic	/etc/init/ssh.conf
2010-08-31T13:54:00.000Z	pLr	Panic	the explanation is extremely long Panic, I would explain but its too much for this channel.
2010-08-31T13:54:00.000Z	pLr	Panic	but to sum it up, your system runs that conf file
2010-08-31T13:55:00.000Z	Panic	pLr	Ok, thanks. Do you know some keywords I can search for to find this explanation online? :-)
2010-08-31T13:55:00.000Z	pLr	Panic	run: man init
2010-08-31T13:57:00.000Z	pLr	Panic	not at all
2010-08-31T13:57:00.000Z	pLr	Panic	sry init was replaced by upstart
2010-08-31T13:59:00.000Z	pLr	Panic	you seem to have answered yourself :p
