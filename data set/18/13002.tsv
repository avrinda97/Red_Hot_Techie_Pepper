2006-03-07T07:51:00.000Z	engla	Toma-	I certainly have udev running. So that should be in place, right? But could it be that it won't automount things that are not in /etc/fstab
2006-03-07T07:51:00.000Z	Toma-	engla	yep
2006-03-07T07:51:00.000Z	Toma-	engla	what are u doing?
2006-03-07T07:53:00.000Z	Toma-	engla	cant you just use gphoto?
2006-03-07T07:53:00.000Z	engla	Toma-	is that something I have to install? I'd love to get  asimple app to do this for me
2006-03-07T07:55:00.000Z	Toma-	engla	"gthumb --import-photos"
2006-03-07T07:57:00.000Z	Toma-	engla	do this for me, click System > Preferences > Removable Drives and Media
2006-03-07T07:58:00.000Z	engla	Toma-	right. Thanks for all the tips, I'll try again
2006-03-07T07:58:00.000Z	Toma-	engla	nonono
2006-03-07T07:58:00.000Z	Toma-	engla	do this for me, click System > Preferences > Removable Drives and Media , then click Camera and tell me what it says in the Digital Camera box
2006-03-07T07:59:00.000Z	engla	Toma-	gnome-volume-manager-gthumb %h
2006-03-07T07:59:00.000Z	engla	Toma-	the checkbox for importing is checked
2006-03-07T07:59:00.000Z	Toma-	engla	ok... as soon as your camera is connected, gthumb SHOULD pop up automagically...
2006-03-07T08:00:00.000Z	engla	Toma-	well it didn't. :-(
2006-03-07T08:00:00.000Z	Toma-	engla	did "gthumb --import-photos" do anything?
2006-03-07T08:01:00.000Z	engla	Toma-	I didn't try that then, I didn't know about it. Right now it pops up a box about importing, but there is nothing to import from right now
