2012-01-12T00:35:00.000Z	kanazky	aeon-ltd	sounds good, which forum should I post in?
2012-01-12T00:36:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	kanazky	ubuntu forums
2012-01-12T00:36:00.000Z	kanazky	aeon-ltd	There isnt a window manager forum :(
2012-01-12T00:38:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	kanazky	this may sound counter productive but ask in #archlinux however DO NOT mention ubuntu, state you are compiling from source and not using 'abs' - they have a lot more dwm users in there
2012-01-12T00:38:00.000Z	kanazky	aeon-ltd	oh
