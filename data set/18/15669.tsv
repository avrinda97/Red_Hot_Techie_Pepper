2005-09-21T10:08:00.000Z	zovirl		any idea why windows often open up behind other windows?  Shouldn't they show up on top?
2005-09-21T10:09:00.000Z	zovirl		bicchi unless the ATI installer has an uninstall mode, I don't think there is a good answer.  That's why packages are nice :)
2005-09-21T10:10:00.000Z	zovirl		bicchi if you could get a list of all the files it installed you could remove by hand
2005-09-21T10:10:00.000Z	Bicchi	zovirl	yeah unfortunally i am finding this the hard way
2005-09-21T10:10:00.000Z	zovirl		bicchi yeah :)
2005-09-21T10:10:00.000Z	zovirl		bicchi can you just leave the files there?  clutter, I know...but do you really need them removed?
2005-09-21T10:11:00.000Z	Bicchi	zovirl	no i don't, the problem is that i am trying to use my dual monitor setup and its not working. I even tried the fglrx drivers and no luck either
2005-09-21T10:12:00.000Z	zovirl		bicchi: no ideas.  the nvidia installer has an --uninstall option.  Don't know if ATI does also
2005-09-21T10:12:00.000Z	Bicchi	zovirl	it only works when i use the ati drivers that come with ubuntu
2005-09-21T10:12:00.000Z	zovirl		bicchi: I have nvidia not ATI...
2005-09-21T10:12:00.000Z	zovirl		bicchi: so I don't really know
2005-09-21T10:12:00.000Z	Bicchi	zovirl	do you also have dual monitors
2005-09-21T10:12:00.000Z	zovirl		bicchi: well, 1 monitor & 1 TV
2005-09-21T10:13:00.000Z	zovirl	poofyhair	I don't know, nvidia's twinview didn't impress me.  I ended up using the other mode
2005-09-21T10:13:00.000Z	Bicchi	zovirl	the problem is that when i move windows inside kde i get a lot of drag from the edges of the windows been displayed.
2005-09-21T10:14:00.000Z	Bicchi	zovirl	the same happens in gnome. so i think it has to do with the acceleration.
2005-09-21T10:15:00.000Z	zovirl		bicchi: drag?
2005-09-21T10:15:00.000Z	Bicchi	zovirl	yeah like that ghost effect
