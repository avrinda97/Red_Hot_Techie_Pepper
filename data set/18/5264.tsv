2008-11-17T22:49:00.000Z	Biscuit		hello, anybody friendly care to help me with my partitioning? Pretty please? I have half my C drive partitioned ready for ubuntu but when I use the installer it is not making it easy for me to work out how to tell it to use that part of my c drive. Can anyone offer me a little guidance? Thanks
2008-11-17T22:51:00.000Z	Biscuit		hi m2k, it was partitioned when I first attgempted a ubuntu install. Unfortunately the install was corrupt and I have had to start again from scratch
2008-11-17T22:52:00.000Z	BHSPitCSP	Biscuit	sure you can.
2008-11-17T22:52:00.000Z	BHSPitCSP	Biscuit	are you choosing to Manually partition when the installer asks you?
2008-11-17T22:55:00.000Z	BHSPitCSP	Biscuit	you select that free space, and then click the Create Partition button (I'm not sure exactly what the button is called, but something along those lines.)
2008-11-17T22:56:00.000Z	Biscuit	BHSPitCSP	I've done that and now it's asking me if I want the partition at the beginning or the end and what sort of file system I want to use, as well as a mount point. Any ideas?
2008-11-17T22:57:00.000Z	BHSPitCSP	Biscuit	how much free space are you working with?  I recommend making one partition for the Ubuntu OS, one partition for your home folders (personal files and settings), and another for swap space (virtual memory).  I know it sounds out-of-the-way, but it's a good setup for a few reasons
2008-11-17T23:01:00.000Z	Biscuit	BHSPitCSP	I've got a 50/50 split of my 250gb drive. I take your point of splitting my partition into 3 but what are the settings I tell ubuntu installer I want to use?
2008-11-17T23:03:00.000Z	BHSPitCSP	Biscuit	I'd say:  Make one at the beginning, 10GB, ext3 format, mounted at "/":   Make one at the beginning, 2GB, swap format, no mount point:  Make one at beginning, use all remaining space, ext3 format, mount at "/home"
2008-11-17T23:03:00.000Z	BHSPitCSP	Biscuit	in that order :)
2008-11-17T23:04:00.000Z	Biscuit	BHSPitCSP	that's ace, cheers. Just one last Q, are these primary or logical?
2008-11-17T23:04:00.000Z	BHSPitCSP	Biscuit	that tells it to use that 10GB partition as the root ("/") directory of the OS, and the large remaining space will be used as the home directory ("/home")
2008-11-17T23:04:00.000Z	BHSPitCSP	Biscuit	probably needs to be logical.
2008-11-17T23:05:00.000Z	BHSPitCSP	Biscuit	a hard drive can only have 4 primary partitions at a maximum.  Making these logical combines them into one primary partition.
2008-11-17T23:06:00.000Z	BHSPitCSP	Biscuit	partitioning is probably the single most complicated part of installing an operating system
2008-11-17T23:08:00.000Z	Biscuit	BHSPitCSP	I'm glad it isn't meant to get any harder after this then!
2008-11-17T23:11:00.000Z	BHSPitCSP	Biscuit	ha, yes.  You're in good from here.  This is also the step where it pays most to be careful of what you do -- there's no Recycle Bin for partitions.
2008-11-17T23:11:00.000Z	Biscuit	BHSPitCSP	werd to that. Thankfully I am not a total spaz and have backed up everything from my C: so can afford to lose it if I nonce it all up
