2011-09-24T17:50:00.000Z	monotonia		I set up setupcon, but I must enter "setupcon" command every time I enter tty, to have my settings. I used setupcon --save, but nothing changed. WHat to do?
2011-09-24T17:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	monotonia	could add it to ~/.bashrc
2011-09-24T17:52:00.000Z	monotonia	ActionParsnip	where it is, to change it globally?
2011-09-24T17:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	monotonia	/etc/environment  I believe
2011-09-28T02:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	monotonia	what wireless chip does it use?
2011-09-28T02:02:00.000Z	monotonia	ActionParsnip	Prism, but the driver is all OK and working
2011-09-28T02:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	monotonia	doesn't answer the question
2011-09-28T02:03:00.000Z	monotonia	ActionParsnip	Prism ISL3886
2011-09-28T02:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	monotonia	is it usb based, or pci?
2011-09-28T02:06:00.000Z	monotonia	ActionParsnip	PCI
2011-09-28T02:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	monotonia	tried the p54pci driver in the default install?
2011-09-28T02:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	monotonia	you may need to install linux-firmware   you may need to run:    dmesg | grep -i firm     to see if there is a firmware missing, there is a NATIVE driver, so using the windows driver makes no sense..
2011-09-28T02:09:00.000Z	monotonia	ActionParsnip	I am using the native driver. It works. The problem is completely different.
2011-09-28T02:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	monotonia	I thought you said you'd used the windows driver?
2011-09-28T02:11:00.000Z	monotonia	ActionParsnip	I said I tried it and used ceni, and now installed native one, but normal network menager still thinks I want to use other program to manage it

2011-09-28T02:16:00.000Z	monotonia	ActionParsnip	I have no problems with driver, really, it works fine. :) I just want to change settings of the network-manager to allow it to manage, because I was using the different program to managing wlan1, and it thinks I still want to do it.
2011-09-28T02:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	monotonia	try wicd, it is more flexible and you can set the interface name, network manager seems to expect wlan0
