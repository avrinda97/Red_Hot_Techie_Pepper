2009-12-11T21:55:00.000Z	sal_	rickyrickyricky	you can download the files, etc to a usb then unload them to ubuntu
2009-12-11T21:57:00.000Z	sal_	rickyrickyricky	when this is all done, goto your administration tab to drivers to enable the b43
2009-12-11T22:03:00.000Z	sal_	rickyrickyricky	not all b43 drivers are supported.  you should confirm what you have b43xx ??
2009-12-11T22:23:00.000Z	sal_	rickyrickyricky	go back to https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/bcm43xx and follow the instruction for "no alternate internet access"
