2006-06-22T09:19:00.000Z	made		hello all..
2006-06-22T09:20:00.000Z	made		I'm on my 3rd re installation of 6.06 reinstall..
2006-06-22T09:20:00.000Z	made		due to xgl/compiz.. I can't seem to get in contact with anybody from the #xgl
2006-06-22T09:21:00.000Z	n0ctuRnaL-fieNd	made	whats the problem with xgl that u have?
2006-06-22T09:22:00.000Z	made	n0ctuRnaL-fieNd	it doesn't work in the way it should (cubed workspaces, wobbly)
2006-06-22T09:22:00.000Z	n0ctuRnaL-fieNd	made	ha , ur lucky u got that much to work
2006-06-22T09:22:00.000Z	made	n0ctuRnaL-fieNd	I had it working at one time completely
2006-06-22T09:22:00.000Z	n0ctuRnaL-fieNd	made	which compiz did u use?
2006-06-22T09:23:00.000Z	made	n0ctuRnaL-fieNd	then I started getting random errors and lock ups
2006-06-22T09:23:00.000Z	n0ctuRnaL-fieNd	made	yes but there are like 4 different compiz packages
2006-06-22T09:25:00.000Z	n0ctuRnaL-fieNd	made	there is compiz, compiz-kde, compiz-gnome , compiz-vanilla-gnome, and compiz-vanilla
2006-06-22T09:26:00.000Z	n0ctuRnaL-fieNd	made	i think thats the one that has all the cool stuff in it
2006-06-22T09:27:00.000Z	n0ctuRnaL-fieNd	made	remember its an alpha software , so dont expect it to work, and unless u have some specific bugs to report no one will prabably listen to u
2006-06-22T09:28:00.000Z	made	n0ctuRnaL-fieNd	even if it is alpha I should be able to install it correctly every time I attempt to do so.. I don't understand why I get different results every time I try to install
2006-06-22T09:28:00.000Z	n0ctuRnaL-fieNd	made	what video card do u have?
2006-06-22T09:31:00.000Z	made	n0ctuRnaL-fieNd	Nvidia GeForce 6600 GT
2006-06-22T09:31:00.000Z	n0ctuRnaL-fieNd	made	i might have an old driver or something , so far ive seen bunch of people have it working with nvidia cards and gnome
