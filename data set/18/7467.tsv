2008-01-18T10:41:00.000Z	RyanPrior		Both VLC and Totem suddenly started playing videos wrong just now. Instead of picture, it just shows a bunch of colored vertical lines. Sound comes out fine.
2008-01-18T10:43:00.000Z	RyanPrior		Both VLC and Totem suddenly started playing videos wrong just now. Instead of picture, it just shows a bunch of colored vertical lines. Sound comes out fine. How do I fix that?
2008-01-18T10:44:00.000Z	Rubin	RyanPrior	maybe a video driver problem.
2008-01-18T10:44:00.000Z	Rubin	RyanPrior	they both probably use 'xv' to draw to the screen
2008-01-18T10:44:00.000Z	RyanPrior	Rubin	It happened just now, though. I played one movie and it was fine, then it broke on the next one.
2008-01-18T10:44:00.000Z	Rubin	RyanPrior	try rebooting
2008-01-18T10:44:00.000Z	RyanPrior	Rubin	So I rebooted to see if that would fix it, and no dice,.
2008-01-18T10:44:00.000Z	Rubin	RyanPrior	weird..
2008-01-18T10:44:00.000Z	Rubin	RyanPrior	what did you change?
2008-01-18T10:45:00.000Z	RyanPrior	Rubin	nothing. I was just watching movies and browsing the 'net.
2008-01-18T10:45:00.000Z	Rubin	RyanPrior	try powering the system fully off for like 10 seconds and starting it up. maybe the video card is in a bad state
2008-01-18T10:57:00.000Z	Rubin	RyanPrior	tried multiple videos?
2008-01-18T10:57:00.000Z	RyanPrior	Rubin	I've tried multiple videos, including ones I've had around for months and watched before,.
2008-01-18T10:58:00.000Z	RyanPrior	Rubin	If I run Totem as root, it still has the same problem.
2008-01-18T10:59:00.000Z	Rubin	RyanPrior	only thing i can think of is to mess with X settings
2008-01-18T11:00:00.000Z	RyanPrior	Rubin	Like I said, it's only videos that it's having trouble with. It can play music visualizations in the same space. Is that something that might have to do with X?
2008-11-03T07:47:00.000Z	RyanPrior	Rubin	It doesn't sound like an xorg problem, if the caps lock is flashing (indicative of kernel panic)
2008-11-03T07:47:00.000Z	Rubin	RyanPrior	but it gets as far as starting x before it happens...
