2006-04-23T07:03:00.000Z	ifr	nickgarvey	hey! Yes, including audio playback!
2006-04-23T07:04:00.000Z	nickgarvey	ifr	hmm, let me get audacity (I am actually running suse right now but eh I'll try)
2006-04-23T07:10:00.000Z	ifr	nickgarvey	any luck :)
2006-04-23T07:12:00.000Z	ifr	nickgarvey	you still with us?
2006-04-23T07:13:00.000Z	nickgarvey	ifr	eek what
2006-04-23T07:13:00.000Z	nickgarvey	ifr	yeah some source is messed up, still getting audacity
2006-04-23T07:25:00.000Z	nickgarvey	ifr	is something else using your sound card? like a music player?
2006-04-23T07:27:00.000Z	ifr	nickgarvey	- Ah, maybe maybe
2006-04-23T07:28:00.000Z	ifr	nickgarvey	mplayer had been opened but was not playing. Now it is off completely but still no soap
2006-04-23T07:28:00.000Z	nickgarvey	ifr	firefox maybe? anything?
2006-04-23T07:29:00.000Z	ifr	nickgarvey	everything's off - everything, and still - there was an error initializing the audio i/o layer. You will not be able to play or record audio
2006-04-23T07:30:00.000Z	nickgarvey	ifr	yes something else is, that's the same error I got
2006-04-23T07:30:00.000Z	nickgarvey	ifr	I closed amarok and it worked
2006-04-23T07:30:00.000Z	nickgarvey	ifr	check ps ax
2006-04-23T07:30:00.000Z	ifr	nickgarvey	what am I grepping for though
2006-04-23T07:32:00.000Z	nickgarvey	ifr	try killall gdm, (this will kill your gui, and this irc session) and then start it again with sudo gdm, then try audacity
