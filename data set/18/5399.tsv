2009-02-20T04:32:00.000Z	jj_galvez		installed package not showing up in syaptic
2009-02-20T04:33:00.000Z	glitsj16	jj_galvez	odd indeed, using "dpkg --get-selections | grep -v deinstall | grep <fill-in-packagename-in-question>" you might find out if it actually installed ok. Does that return anything usefull ?
2009-02-20T04:34:00.000Z	jj_galvez	glitsj16	that reports install
2009-02-20T04:36:00.000Z	glitsj16	jj_galvez	in that case you might run "sudo dpkg -r <packagename> to remove it and try reinstalling it again .. what package is causing the trouble by the way ? might be a bug on it, hard to tell without more info i suppose ...
2009-02-20T04:36:00.000Z	jj_galvez	glitsj16	its gsmartcontrol I downloaded it from getdeb
2009-02-20T04:38:00.000Z	glitsj16	jj_galvez	thanks, trying it now to see if i get the same result, hang on please
2009-02-20T04:38:00.000Z	jj_galvez	glitsj16	ok, thanks
2009-02-20T04:44:00.000Z	glitsj16	jj_galvez	it installed cleanly and here it does show up properly in synaptic ... did you install the .deb manually or via double-clicking ?
2009-02-20T04:45:00.000Z	jj_galvez	glitsj16	double clicking initially, then manually after doing the dpkg -r thing
2009-02-20T04:46:00.000Z	glitsj16	jj_galvez	odd indeed, still nothing showing up i take it ?
2009-02-20T04:46:00.000Z	jj_galvez	glitsj16	nothing, really odd, like I said I did the same thing at home and its showing up in synaptic as it should there, just not on this computer at work
2009-02-20T04:49:00.000Z	glitsj16	jj_galvez	i'm afraid i can't really think of anything else to try ... might be different synaptic preferences between those machines, that's a longshot guess .. goodluck :)
2009-02-20T04:49:00.000Z	jj_galvez	glitsj16	thanks, I've got a meeting to go to anyway I'll try googling some.  Thanks for the help
2009-02-20T04:55:00.000Z	jj_galvez	glitsj16	this is even odder, I found it under ulilities, but if I enter the package name in the search box nothing comes up
2009-02-20T04:57:00.000Z	glitsj16	jj_galvez	looks like it made a mess of things indeed ... i would be inclined to purge it and try again installing it via gdebi-gtk
2009-02-20T04:57:00.000Z	jj_galvez	glitsj16	sounds like a really good idea
2009-02-20T04:57:00.000Z	jj_galvez	glitsj16	thanks again
2009-02-20T04:58:00.000Z	glitsj16	jj_galvez	very welcome, hope you get things fixed
