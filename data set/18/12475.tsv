2006-04-19T11:02:00.000Z	twb	blindx	aptitude 0.4 or 0.2?
2006-04-19T11:02:00.000Z	blindx		aptitude 0.2.15.9 compiled at Sep 22 2005 09:10:29
2006-04-19T11:02:00.000Z	twb	blindx	OK, you have the old, shitty one.
2006-04-19T11:02:00.000Z	blindx		oh, great! :D
2006-04-19T11:02:00.000Z	twb	blindx	are you using breezy still?
2006-04-19T11:02:00.000Z	blindx		still? i just installed it two days ago
2006-04-19T11:03:00.000Z	twb	blindx	OK.  You'll have to resolve the conflicts manually.
2006-04-19T11:03:00.000Z	twb	blindx	unless you wanna upgrade to dapper? ;-P
2006-04-19T11:03:00.000Z	blindx		that sounds like fun, twb.
2006-04-19T11:03:00.000Z	blindx	twb	is this going to interfere with my laziness at all?
2006-04-19T11:03:00.000Z	twb	blindx	http://www.luv.asn.au/overheads/aptitude/aptitude-intro.html
2006-04-19T11:03:00.000Z	twb	blindx	read that.  It will build character.
