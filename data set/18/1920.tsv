2010-10-09T23:44:00.000Z	Ken8521	DanneD-swe	well, are you using 32 or 64bit?
2010-10-09T23:47:00.000Z	Ken8521	DanneD-swe	now when you boot Ubuntu, double click it, and hopefully it won't have any dependency problems
2010-10-09T23:53:00.000Z	Ken8521	DanneD-swe	what is the wireless device that gve you all these problems?
2010-10-10T00:08:00.000Z	Ken8521	DanneD-swe	what version of Ubuntu did you install?
2010-10-10T00:10:00.000Z	Ken8521	DanneD-swe	ok.. was just making sure you weren't installing 8.10... been a lot of that lately(i guess some book came out w/ that cd)
2010-10-10T00:13:00.000Z	Ken8521	DanneD-swe	why wouldn't 10.10 install?...
2010-10-10T00:14:00.000Z	DanneD-swe	Ken8521	It stopped at the ''who are you'' screen
2010-10-10T00:14:00.000Z	Ken8521	DanneD-swe	well you were past the hard part(partitioning)
2010-10-10T00:28:00.000Z	Ken8521	DanneD-swe	i didn't ever have that prob w/ 10.04, but there ws a bug on that w/ 10.04
2010-10-10T00:29:00.000Z	Ken8521	DanneD-swe	yes, thats why i asked you what your sond device was
2010-10-10T00:33:00.000Z	Ken8521	DanneD-swe	open a terminal and type "lspci"(lowercase L) and hit enter.. .look at the output, and find your sound device
2010-10-10T00:35:00.000Z	Ken8521	DanneD-swe	never heard of tat one
2010-10-10T00:38:00.000Z	Ken8521	DanneD-swe	i kno it was an issue w/ the intelHDA sound devices on Ubuntu 10.10(worked perfect for me in 10.04), did some googling, and found the fix, it involved edting some configuration files
