2006-04-10T08:13:00.000Z	wladston		Guys ... I want to understand something .... why isn't the universe and multiverse installed by default ??
2006-04-10T08:13:00.000Z	wladston		hum ....
2006-04-10T08:14:00.000Z	wladston		sure ... but ... Why don't you guys at least make it clear on the "Add Applications" ?
2006-04-10T08:15:00.000Z	wladston		so people can know they have some missing packs ..
2006-04-10T08:16:00.000Z	wladston		I wanted to install gmail-notify and took a long time to figure out how to do it via apt-get . Like me, there are lots of users that don't know what do do after searching a packet and not finding it ...
2006-04-10T08:16:00.000Z	wladston		Maybe not include by default, but a warning there should be useful ...
2006-04-10T08:17:00.000Z	wladston		yeah  - all time "nothing found"
2006-04-10T08:17:00.000Z	wladston		but now I installed via apt-get
2006-04-10T08:17:00.000Z	wladston		after enabling the repositories...
2006-04-10T08:17:00.000Z	wladston		strange them ... O.o
2006-04-10T08:17:00.000Z	orbin	wladston	well, there _is_ a section in sys>help>starter guide
2006-04-10T08:18:00.000Z	orbin	wladston	maybe they should show that on first bootup
2006-04-10T08:19:00.000Z	orbin	wladston	you're right though.  i can see how new users could get a little lost
2006-04-10T08:21:00.000Z	orbin	wladston	absolutely
2006-04-10T08:22:00.000Z	orbin	wladston	we're geeks though.  we're not meant to think about usability :P
2006-04-10T08:23:00.000Z	orbin	wladston	i think there's a dev channel.  in any case, try the forum or mailing list
2006-04-10T08:24:00.000Z	orbin	wladston	possibly.  i never had the need to bug them
2006-04-10T08:24:00.000Z	orbin	wladston	it's not #ubuntu-dev
