2006-03-22T13:30:00.000Z	Ed_R		Hey, folks. Question for you all--any idea on time before GNOME 2.14 becomes apt-gettable for Breezy?
2006-03-22T13:31:00.000Z	ompaul	Ed_R	after it gets released it will be moved into dapper and should be released with dapper whenever that is some time in the next 4 to 10 weeks or thereabouts
2006-03-22T13:31:00.000Z	Ed_R	ompaul	I'm not upgrading to dapper. GNOME 2.14 has been released. Why isn't it going to be available for Breezy?
2006-03-22T13:32:00.000Z	ompaul	Ed_R	because it 5.10 is stable and will not get new packages, only security fixes
2006-03-22T13:32:00.000Z	ompaul	Ed_R	^^^
2006-03-22T13:33:00.000Z	ompaul	Ed_R	it is not released if the doors fall off that is the way of the world - when stable then you move i.e. when released
2006-03-22T13:34:00.000Z	ompaul	Ed_R	chill with the discriptive language this is a family channel :0
2006-03-22T13:34:00.000Z	Ed_R	ompaul	There is NOTHING in Dapper that would push me to move save GNOME 2.14 and since it's almost a certainty that Dapper would result in a more-or-less-required reinstall, I'm very not enthusiastic about the idea.
2006-03-22T13:35:00.000Z	ompaul	Ed_R	what have you done to your 5.10 install that makes you think it would be required for 6.x ?
2006-03-22T13:35:00.000Z	Ed_R	ompaul	I'm not looking forward to having to blam the whole thing and go through an install again. I thought I was done doing that when I ditched RedHat.
2006-03-22T13:35:00.000Z	ompaul	Ed_R	breezy was the name of the current release before* it was released when it became 5.10
2006-03-22T13:36:00.000Z	ompaul	Ed_R	we have a very simple update process that works if you have not grabbed stuff from all over the interenet, please read the distro logic page
2006-03-22T13:37:00.000Z	Ed_R	ompaul	I've read distrologic already, and I *have* grabbed .debs from outside Ubuntu's repositories (frequently because they lack what I need).
2006-03-22T13:40:00.000Z	Ed_R	ompaul	Is there a way to poke Synaptic so that it can find Dapper packages? I'm okay with it being unsupported so long as I can get at it.
2006-03-22T13:41:00.000Z	ompaul	Ed_R	well when it gets in there you may be able to use backports but if you get backports badly wrong - you will need to reinstall, if you get them wrong you will wish you never heard of the word - so back up your personal data before you go playing with them
2006-03-22T13:43:00.000Z	Ed_R	ompaul	Thanks for the warning, but I think I'll risk it (and I can't upgrade to Dapper until they're mailing CDs anyway, so it's kind of moot). Any idea when that stuff will be in the apt sources?
2006-03-22T13:44:00.000Z	ompaul	Ed_R	well the gnome project need to release it, then the ubuntu maintainers need to polish it and put it into dapper for testing (should not need much) and then okay - so there ya go
2006-03-22T13:46:00.000Z	Ed_R	ompaul	I'd just compile the thing, if I didn't remember what happened the last time I compiled GNOME. Suffice to say I spent the next week looking for my CDs.
