2012-05-17T02:47:00.000Z	cheese1756	beatiful_sora	I hope you disciplined your son pretty strongly for all this
2012-05-17T02:48:00.000Z	beatiful_sora	cheese1756	for the penis or the blinking line?
2012-05-17T02:48:00.000Z	beatiful_sora	cheese1756	yes that
2012-05-17T02:49:00.000Z	beatiful_sora	cheese1756	also the other day he set the microwave on fire! i am at a wits end!
2012-05-17T02:49:00.000Z	cheese1756	beatiful_sora	Sorry if this was already asked, but do you have backups?
2012-05-17T02:49:00.000Z	beatiful_sora	cheese1756	i am afraid not :(
2012-05-17T02:49:00.000Z	cheese1756	beatiful_sora	You might want to purchase an external USB drive in the future, about double your hard drive space should be fine. I learned that the hard way
2012-05-17T02:51:00.000Z	beatiful_sora	cheese1756	i have a usb stick, is this correct
2012-05-17T02:52:00.000Z	cheese1756	beatiful_sora	What I typically do is I backup my most important files to Dropbox, a USB stick, and an external hard drive, then I'll back up the slightly less important stuff to the USB drive, then just about everything to the external one
2012-05-17T02:53:00.000Z	beatiful_sora	cheese1756	okay my usb stick also was filled with penis by my son :(
2012-05-17T02:54:00.000Z	beatiful_sora	cheese1756	he has done this to my camera and usb and phone and digital photo frame!
2012-05-17T02:54:00.000Z	cheese1756	beatiful_sora	You might want to password protect access to your computer, and maybe try to identify why your son is acting this way, taking him to help if necessary
2012-05-17T02:54:00.000Z	beatiful_sora	cheese1756	he said it was a joke :(
2012-05-17T03:01:00.000Z	cheese1756	beatiful_sora	Nothing will execute, since it has all been deleted
2012-05-17T03:02:00.000Z	beatiful_sora	cheese1756	i am afraid not, but there is a laptop if that helps
2012-05-17T03:03:00.000Z	beatiful_sora	cheese1756	okay, how do i do that
2012-05-17T03:03:00.000Z	beatiful_sora	cheese1756	yes, although my son has filled it with penis, does this matter?
