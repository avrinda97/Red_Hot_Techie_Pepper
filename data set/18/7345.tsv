2011-09-02T00:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dexter_	i see, freaky
2011-09-02T00:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dexter_	xchat is an irc client
2011-09-02T00:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dexter_	restore your settings from backup then, all I can really suggest
2011-09-02T00:28:00.000Z	dexter_	ActionParsnip	noob here never learnt to make a backup, afraid I dont have one, unless ubuntu does that automatically...
2011-09-02T00:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dexter_	oh dear
2011-09-02T00:29:00.000Z	dexter_	ActionParsnip	lol
2011-09-02T00:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dexter_	that only cleans the apt cache
2011-09-02T00:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dexter_	what happens when you hit a link?
2011-09-02T00:39:00.000Z	dexter_	ActionParsnip	absolutely nothing, it makes an attempt to load the page and then nothing
2011-09-02T00:41:00.000Z	dexter_	ActionParsnip	the changes made to firefox were made together with a kernel update: mine now is 2.6.38.11 and GNOME 2.32.1
2011-09-02T00:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dexter_	is it ok in other browsers?
2011-09-02T00:42:00.000Z	dexter_	ActionParsnip	yes, chromium seems to work fine
2011-09-03T22:21:00.000Z	dexter_	ActionParsnip	I restarted but it still doesn't work.
