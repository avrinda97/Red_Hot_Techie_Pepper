2011-08-01T01:46:00.000Z	th0r	goer	do you have it enabled so the workspace switches when the mouse moves off the edge? That has to be turned on in xfce to enable the drag feature

2011-08-01T03:39:00.000Z	th0r	goer	I would just determine what the filesystem at the end is, and google to make sure there is no file size limit
