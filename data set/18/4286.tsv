2009-05-04T00:22:00.000Z	Graloth		I'm a new user to ubuntu, need some help connecting to my work network, anyone know how? (i need to connect to the network because they use a shared IP and i need to get access to my computers desktop via the local IP once in the network)
2009-05-04T00:22:00.000Z	Graloth		how do i connect to a work network?
2009-05-04T00:23:00.000Z	Graloth		let me explain it a bit more in detail :P
2009-05-04T00:25:00.000Z	Graloth		I'm at home and need to connect to the network at my work, i can do this perfectly fine in windows, but want to do it in linux aswell, i need to connect to the network at my work because they use a shared IP, which means i cant just use remote desktop to connect to my computer with that IP, i need to have connection to the network and then use my local IP (the one for my work computer) to connect remotely to the desktop
2009-05-04T00:25:00.000Z	Graloth		im not at work, i need to connect remotely
2009-05-04T00:26:00.000Z	usser	Graloth	how did it work on windows?
2009-05-04T00:27:00.000Z	usser	Graloth	vpn then?
2009-05-04T00:27:00.000Z	Graloth	usser	what?
2009-05-04T00:28:00.000Z	usser	Graloth	network connections->add a connection to workplace-> connect through vpn. did you do any of that?
2009-05-04T00:28:00.000Z	Graloth	usser	i have no idea what vpn is
2009-05-04T00:29:00.000Z	usser	Graloth	did you add another network connection in your networks?
2009-05-04T00:29:00.000Z	Graloth	usser	nope, and all VPN buttons cant be clicked, they are disabled for some reason
2009-05-04T00:30:00.000Z	usser	Graloth	for vpn in network manager you need sudo apt-get install network-manager-vpn
2009-05-04T00:30:00.000Z	Graloth	usser	ok, one moment
2009-05-04T00:30:00.000Z	usser	Graloth	but you did use the local ip of your machine at work, so that means there was some sort of vpn
2009-05-04T00:31:00.000Z	Graloth	usser	got error:E: Couldn't find package network-manager-vpn
2009-05-04T00:32:00.000Z	usser	Graloth	sudo apt-get install network-manager-pptp sorry
2009-05-04T00:32:00.000Z	Graloth	usser	np, trying again now :)
