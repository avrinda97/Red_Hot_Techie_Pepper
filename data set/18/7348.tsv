2009-09-29T14:11:00.000Z	Josh_		anyone able to tell me the correct way to install grub i have 4 partitions  win 7 vista32 ubuntu  extra space when it goes to install grub i select sdb3 my ubuntu partition but the windows boot manager doesn't see it i tried to use EasyBCD but it fails to load ubuntu any thoughts?
2009-09-29T14:13:00.000Z	Josh_		does that mean i need to install grub to drive 0? the default or he first partition of sdb1?
2009-09-29T14:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Josh_	grub is installed to the MBR of the drive you want bootable, the config will be in /boot
2011-08-26T18:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Josh_	use network manager
2011-08-26T18:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Josh_	yes
2011-08-26T18:14:00.000Z	Josh_	ActionParsnip	how?
2011-08-26T18:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Josh_	either something like:  killall programname
2011-08-26T18:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Josh_	killall is the command, you can also use:  ps -ef | grep name    use the leftmost value as the PID and run:  kill PID
2011-08-26T18:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Josh_	i can think of better ;)
