2005-05-19T08:28:00.000Z	black_Nightmare		any of you know about linux and videos?
2005-05-19T08:29:00.000Z	black_Nightmare		I was wondering if video-out is not always supported by linux: true?
2005-05-19T08:29:00.000Z	ivoks	black_Nightmare	it is or isn't supported by manufacturer
2005-05-19T08:31:00.000Z	ivoks	black_Nightmare	i don't think that chipset has ever had tv-out
2005-05-19T08:31:00.000Z	ivoks	black_Nightmare	on lot of laptops there is connector for s-video, but isn't working
2005-05-19T08:32:00.000Z	ivoks	black_Nightmare	well... it says it isn't supported
2005-05-19T08:33:00.000Z	ivoks	black_Nightmare	I never worked with that chipset :(
2005-05-19T08:34:00.000Z	ivoks	black_Nightmare	modem?
2005-05-19T08:35:00.000Z	ivoks	black_Nightmare	yes, mine is working
2005-05-19T08:36:00.000Z	ivoks	black_Nightmare	it's intel's modem
2005-05-19T08:38:00.000Z	ivoks	black_Nightmare	LCDs do good only on one resolution
2005-05-19T08:39:00.000Z	ivoks	black_Nightmare	it would work... but 1280x800 is 16:9, and 800x600 is 4:3
2005-05-19T08:39:00.000Z	ivoks	black_Nightmare	well, my screen can do both
2005-05-19T08:39:00.000Z	ivoks	black_Nightmare	depends on config in BIOS
2005-05-19T08:40:00.000Z	ivoks	black_Nightmare	ugly
2005-05-19T08:42:00.000Z	ivoks	black_Nightmare	?
2005-05-19T08:45:00.000Z	ivoks	black_Nightmare	why would you do that?
2005-05-19T08:46:00.000Z	ivoks	black_Nightmare	it will look same, only wider
