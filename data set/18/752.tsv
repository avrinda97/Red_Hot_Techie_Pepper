2011-10-12T07:04:00.000Z	thenickperson	reisio	My system's audio in Ubuntu had weird issues before, and at one point wouldn't play audio at all. After updating sound software, that problem is solved now, but whenever I plug in headphones (anything into the audio out), audio plays though both my headphones and my speakers. How can I make it just play via my headphones if they're plugged in?

2011-10-12T07:06:00.000Z	thenickperson	reisio	Yes.
2011-10-12T07:09:00.000Z	thenickperson	reisio	Do you kno what I could try to do to fix it?
2011-10-12T07:10:00.000Z	reisio	thenickperson	you probably just need to feed ALSA a more specific "model"

2011-10-12T07:16:00.000Z	thenickperson	reisio	Thanks!
2011-10-12T07:17:00.000Z	thenickperson	reisio	What part of this guide should I be looking at exactly?
2011-10-12T07:17:00.000Z	reisio	thenickperson	reading it all won't hurt :p
2011-10-12T07:18:00.000Z	reisio	thenickperson	but the important part is going to be editing /etc/modprobe.d/alsa-base.conf to have something like 'options snd-hda-intel model=HD-Audio', etc.
