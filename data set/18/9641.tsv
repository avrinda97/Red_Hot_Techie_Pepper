2007-03-13T08:32:00.000Z	K3nto	Xs142	how are you liking it
2007-03-13T08:34:00.000Z	Xs142	K3nto	I don't know yet, I'm still unsure why on earth I installed it at all. Somewhere along the line I thought it would be better for audio production, but then I realized I know nothing about any programs to use so.. Well :P
2007-03-13T08:35:00.000Z	K3nto	Xs142	have people told you about the AppDBs that come with ubuntu
2007-03-13T08:35:00.000Z	Xs142	K3nto	No one has told me anything, apart from bruenig here answering my odd and horrible questions..
2007-03-13T08:36:00.000Z	K3nto	Xs142	in ubuntu, there is a built in database of all the most popular applications. simply check off the ones you want or dont want
2007-03-13T08:37:00.000Z	K3nto	Xs142	you=me a week ago. i had a week without school
2007-03-13T08:38:00.000Z	Xs142	K3nto	I have 7 years ahead of me without school, but I'm not sure I'm motivated enough as I have stuff working in windows as it is :P
2007-03-13T08:38:00.000Z	K3nto	Xs142	lol
2007-03-13T08:39:00.000Z	Xs142	K3nto	 Guess I got spoiled with the simplicity of click'n'wait installations that windows provide..
2007-03-13T08:40:00.000Z	K3nto	Xs142	yeah. its just a little more rewarding doing a little bit of work (and learning in the process) to get what you want
2007-03-13T08:41:00.000Z	Xs142	K3nto	While true, one also have to know what to look for... Finding MSC translators for windows was heck in itself, I'm not sure I want to experience the linux take on it :P
2007-03-13T08:44:00.000Z	K3nto	Xs142	i searched in Add/Remove and there are a few that come up. "midi control" is what i searched.
2007-03-13T08:45:00.000Z	Xs142	K3nto	 Let's hope it's a studio controller in there.... a midi controller won't do me any good :P
2007-03-13T08:48:00.000Z	K3nto	Xs142	i PMd u a description of one
2007-03-13T08:49:00.000Z	Xs142	K3nto	Cheers
2007-03-13T08:50:00.000Z	K3nto	Xs142	what you were lookin for?
