2009-01-18T08:19:00.000Z	doughed2003		i have tryed to get my graphics card to work but im just not getting any joy. its a Nvidia Geforce2 GTS?Pro
2009-01-18T08:20:00.000Z	doughed2003		yes.it has none
2009-01-18T08:21:00.000Z	doughed2003		i can't seem to get the drivers to load or install
2009-01-18T08:23:00.000Z	izinucs	doughed2003	that's an older card like the mx series.. you might need to look in Synaptic for the older drivers
2009-01-18T08:25:00.000Z	izinucs	doughed2003	if you have that you need to do some stuff before trying to install it.. first you have to uninstall all nvidia stuff listed as installed in Synaptic
2009-01-18T08:26:00.000Z	izinucs	doughed2003	what spm
2009-01-18T08:26:00.000Z	izinucs	doughed2003	what's spm?
2009-01-18T08:27:00.000Z	izinucs	doughed2003	hang on and I'll look at them..
2009-01-18T08:29:00.000Z	izinucs	doughed2003	you need nvidia-glx-legacy drivers for your card.. is that what you installed?
2009-01-18T08:29:00.000Z	doughed2003	izinucs	thanks
2009-01-18T08:30:00.000Z	izinucs	doughed2003	install that one and see.
2009-01-18T08:31:00.000Z	izinucs	doughed2003	once installed you might find them listed in System>Admin>hardware drivers.. if they are there you'll be able to activate them.
2009-01-18T08:37:00.000Z	izinucs	doughed2003	well if you tag one called nvidia-glx-legacy and it wants to pull other stuff in then that's ok
2009-01-18T08:41:00.000Z	izinucs	doughed2003	if you tagged only the one I mentioned and it pulls the others then so be it.. hit apply and let her rip
2009-01-18T08:59:00.000Z	izinucs	doughed2003	you might look in synaptic for envy-ng and it will help install the right driver.
2009-01-18T09:02:00.000Z	izinucs	doughed2003	is this an old machine?
2009-01-18T09:03:00.000Z	izinucs	doughed2003	is the current graphics card agp?
2009-01-18T09:04:00.000Z	izinucs	doughed2003	it'd be worth looking on craigs list or ebay for something newer like an agp card in the 6000 series.. won't be expensive and much easier to configure.
