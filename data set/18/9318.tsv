2007-11-29T11:14:00.000Z	sunspec		i just used fdisk to make a slave drive with a ext3 and ntfs partition all one ext2 partition so i could use the whole disk for storage. I am getting missing operating system. I booted with the live cd and mount my main ubuntu installation and everything was fine. I suspect that the bootloader info was on the disk i changed the partition tables on. How can i boot a bootloader on my disk containing the partition with ubuntu?
