2010-04-09T18:18:00.000Z	maginot	SeekTruth	search for wipe
2010-04-09T18:19:00.000Z	maginot	SeekTruth	"apt-get install wipe" its what you need
2010-04-09T18:19:00.000Z	SeekTruth	maginot	so a file can be undeleted if I dont use wipe?
2010-04-09T18:20:00.000Z	maginot	SeekTruth	that depends on the wipe level you make, most times it will be unrecoverable
2010-04-09T18:21:00.000Z	maginot	SeekTruth	if you install wipe you can delete a file with "wipe -Q 7 <file>"
2010-04-09T18:48:00.000Z	maginot	SeekTruth	xmms is gone now, you can use vlc, rhythmbox, juk or something like this
2010-04-09T18:50:00.000Z	maginot	SeekTruth	if you like simplicity use VLC, it plays everything beside music
2010-04-09T18:50:00.000Z	SeekTruth	maginot	besides music?
2010-04-09T18:51:00.000Z	maginot	SeekTruth	^
2010-04-09T18:51:00.000Z	SeekTruth	maginot	u over tired? :)
2010-04-09T18:51:00.000Z	maginot	SeekTruth	I mean, it plays everything and music =D
2010-04-09T18:52:00.000Z	maginot	SeekTruth	sometimes I get confused with some english words =X
2010-04-09T18:54:00.000Z	maginot	SeekTruth	VLC plays everything I have seen so far
