2007-02-14T12:28:00.000Z	bp847	seeds	you've tried right clicking on the time in the upper right of the screen, going to adjust time/date, and working from there?
2007-02-14T12:30:00.000Z	seeds	bp847	yes i did that, but i get a message that i can't because im not allowed to use the system configuration
2007-02-14T12:31:00.000Z	bp847	seeds	did it prompt for the root password?
2007-02-14T12:31:00.000Z	seeds	bp847	it didn't

2007-02-14T12:37:00.000Z	bp847	seeds	perfect! doing things like that without a password...you won't be able to, since it's making a change to system settings
