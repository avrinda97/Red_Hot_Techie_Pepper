2012-08-22T03:00:00.000Z	ljack	nightwalkerkg	What have you done so far?
2012-08-22T03:01:00.000Z	nightwalkerkg	ljack	I installed one from the official adobe website via USC,then i installed via terminal sudo apt-get install flashplugin-installer.
2012-08-22T03:02:00.000Z	nightwalkerkg	ljack	Flashplugin-installer
2012-08-22T03:03:00.000Z	nightwalkerkg	ljack	Is there any other way,i am thinking about trying with Synaptic. I think there was someting like flashplugin-nonfree. But i can't remember.
2012-08-22T03:04:00.000Z	ljack	nightwalkerkg	Please install the adobe-flashplugin package.
2012-08-22T03:04:00.000Z	nightwalkerkg	ljack	Just a sec.
2012-08-22T03:06:00.000Z	nightwalkerkg	ljack	adobe-flashplugin is already the newest version.
2012-08-22T03:06:00.000Z	ljack	nightwalkerkg	Restart your browsers.
2012-08-22T03:08:00.000Z	nightwalkerkg	ljack	Could not load shockwave flash. Same thing.
2012-08-22T03:12:00.000Z	nightwalkerkg	ljack	Yeah,i hate thing. I usually install everything i need via terminal.
2012-08-22T03:12:00.000Z	ljack	nightwalkerkg	Synaptic is very good. Never had a single problem with it.
2012-08-22T03:18:00.000Z	nightwalkerkg	ljack	How about the unity 2D ?
2012-08-22T03:40:00.000Z	ljack	nightwalkerkg	The problem is, there's so many "flash" packages...
2012-08-22T03:47:00.000Z	ljack	nightwalkerkg	I'm sure it could.
2012-08-22T03:47:00.000Z	nightwalkerkg	ljack	You are sure why ? :D
2012-08-22T03:47:00.000Z	ljack	nightwalkerkg	Why are you using an outdated version anyway?
2012-08-22T03:48:00.000Z	ljack	nightwalkerkg	Flash does have problems on 10.10 if that's what you're using.
