2011-05-08T13:49:00.000Z	THE_BIG_ONE		Anyone around to anwer a question?
2011-05-08T13:50:00.000Z	THE_BIG_ONE		answer*
2011-05-08T13:50:00.000Z	THE_BIG_ONE		Anyone awake ?
2011-05-08T13:51:00.000Z	THE_BIG_ONE		Well, I'll ask my question:
2011-05-08T13:52:00.000Z	THE_BIG_ONE		Running Ubuntu in virtual box on my main windows machine.
2011-05-08T13:52:00.000Z	THE_BIG_ONE		Been toying around with tunneled OpenGL 3d acceleration
2011-05-08T13:52:00.000Z	THE_BIG_ONE		so
2011-05-08T13:54:00.000Z	THE_BIG_ONE		in 10.xx older OpenGL games using OSS/pulse type "DSP" sound systems work fine. After upgrading vitual machine to 11.04 beta, OSS is no longer included. Adding OSS libraries break sound. Anyone know how people go about using older games running OSS/Pulse/DSP audio
2011-05-08T13:56:00.000Z	Jordan_U	THE_BIG_ONE	Try running "padsp command".
2011-05-08T13:57:00.000Z	THE_BIG_ONE		1 sec
2011-05-08T14:04:00.000Z	THE_BIG_ONE	Jordan_U	Mind giving me an example of usage
2011-05-08T14:05:00.000Z	THE_BIG_ONE	Jordan_U	/dev/dsp: No such file or directory     ||      Could not open /dev/dsp
2011-05-08T14:07:00.000Z	Jordan_U	THE_BIG_ONE	"padsp xmoto" (not that xmoto uses OSS).
2011-05-08T14:08:00.000Z	THE_BIG_ONE	Jordan_U	Right, prepending say, Enemy Territory changes the above error (With normal 11.04 alsa) to this new error: ------- sound initialization -------   ||  Sorry but your soundcard can't do this
2011-05-08T14:09:00.000Z	THE_BIG_ONE		Along with some other Q3 based engine games
2011-05-08T14:10:00.000Z	THE_BIG_ONE		Old 10.10, OpenSuSe, and other distros still using OSS/Pulse/etc work fine considering they still have the dsp device. That emulator doesn't appear to work
2011-05-08T14:13:00.000Z	THE_BIG_ONE	Jordan_U	Any other suggestions / ideas related to that issue?
