2010-07-16T16:50:00.000Z	tensorpudding		gnome-terminal doesn't seem to want to read my .bash_profile automatically
2010-07-16T16:50:00.000Z	jrib	tensorpudding	why would it?
2010-07-16T16:51:00.000Z	tensorpudding	jrib	because that would satisfy my expectations! :)
2010-07-16T16:51:00.000Z	jrib	tensorpudding	what do you want to do?
2010-07-16T16:52:00.000Z	jrib	tensorpudding	put it in the right file?  I still don't know what you are doing but ~/.profile or ~/.bashrc depending on that
2010-07-16T16:53:00.000Z	jrib	tensorpudding	are you using bash...
2010-07-16T16:54:00.000Z	jrib	tensorpudding	how are you determining your ~/.bashrc isn't being read?
2010-07-16T16:55:00.000Z	jrib	tensorpudding	no, best to use the right files for what you want to do :)
2010-07-16T16:57:00.000Z	jrib	tensorpudding	if you read « man bash », you'll see ~/.bash_profile will only be read for login shells
2010-07-16T16:58:00.000Z	jrib	tensorpudding	oh, ok, but it doesn't
2010-07-16T17:00:00.000Z	jrib	tensorpudding	yeah, I disable all that stuff in prefernecs
2010-07-16T17:00:00.000Z	jrib	tensorpudding	meh
2010-07-16T17:04:00.000Z	jrib	tensorpudding	yeah, I didn't think urxvt started login shells by default
2010-07-23T20:37:00.000Z	jrib	tensorpudding	where exactly did you install this user-installed python?
2010-07-23T20:37:00.000Z	tensorpudding	jrib	sereal installed said python
2010-08-22T03:07:00.000Z	jrib	tensorpudding	he's installing refit
