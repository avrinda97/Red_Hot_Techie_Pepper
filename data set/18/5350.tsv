2009-11-24T06:30:00.000Z	hedkandi		can anyone tell me why I have three keyrings?
2009-11-24T06:30:00.000Z	hedkandi		one is called default, one is session and the other called login
2009-11-24T06:31:00.000Z	hedkandi		mount -t ntfs dirname
2009-11-24T06:32:00.000Z	hedkandi		my fstab doesn't contain any mounting for the benefit of ecryptfs
2009-11-24T06:32:00.000Z	hedkandi		and I have an automatically mounted directory
2009-11-24T06:32:00.000Z	hedkandi		so how does that work?
2009-11-24T06:32:00.000Z	uberspaced	hedkandi	are you useing autofs?
2009-11-24T06:33:00.000Z	hedkandi	uberspaced	I dunno
2009-11-24T06:33:00.000Z	uberspaced	hedkandi	what specifically is the problem?
2009-11-24T06:34:00.000Z	uberspaced	hedkandi	there is /etc/init.d/*crypt*
2009-11-24T06:36:00.000Z	uberspaced	hedkandi	ls /etc/init.d/*crypt*
2009-11-24T06:36:00.000Z	hedkandi	uberspaced	what are you saying?

2009-11-24T06:37:00.000Z	uberspaced	hedkandi	yes, with the stars.
2009-11-24T06:38:00.000Z	uberspaced	hedkandi	what version of ubuntu are you on?
2009-11-24T06:40:00.000Z	uberspaced	hedkandi	and you really don't have anything under /etc/init.d/ that's named like "crypt" or something?
