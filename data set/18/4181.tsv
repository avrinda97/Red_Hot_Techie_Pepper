2009-11-08T09:00:00.000Z	kuttans		i read in one of the forum tha  the user renamed the /usr/bin/gcc to gcc.sav and created a new gcc with /usr/bin/gcc -m32 $.*

2009-11-08T09:02:00.000Z	kuttans		i read in one of the forum tha  the user renamed the /usr/bin/gcc to gcc.sav and created a new gcc with /usr/bin/gcc -m32 $.* can anyone tell me what exactly is the meaning of it and how it can be done
2009-11-08T09:03:00.000Z	n8tuser	kuttans	are you compiling ?
2009-11-08T09:05:00.000Z	kuttans	n8tuser	i dont know, im having already gcc the newest version, but with that im getting relink error whie installing oracle
2009-11-08T09:06:00.000Z	n8tuser	kuttans	-> oracle is a beast to install, oracle officially only supports suse and redhat and their own linux.. so trying it on unofficial distro.. you have to jump through hoops
2009-11-08T09:09:00.000Z	kuttans	n8tuser	: do you know about this creating gcc with /usr/bin/gcc -m32 $.*
2009-11-08T09:09:00.000Z	n8tuser	kuttans	nope, and people that makes oracle work gets paid big bux
2009-11-08T09:10:00.000Z	n8tuser	kuttans	try to use the officially supported Oracle platforms..
2009-11-08T09:11:00.000Z	n8tuser	kuttans	-> well linux is linux.. not a whole lots of difference, but official distro are perhaps tweaked with oracle's libs
2009-11-08T09:12:00.000Z	kuttans	n8tuser	exactly but i want to have a balance of flexibility and usability.......anyway
