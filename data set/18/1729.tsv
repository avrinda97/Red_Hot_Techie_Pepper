2011-04-14T04:56:00.000Z	Ben64		if it just happened once, its not a big deal
2011-04-14T04:56:00.000Z	Ben64		and how can you hook up a display to your server?
2011-04-14T04:56:00.000Z	Ben64		its not in a datacenter or anything?
2011-04-14T04:57:00.000Z	Ben64		i've never seen any of my servers
2011-04-14T04:57:00.000Z	Ben64		: /
2011-04-14T04:57:00.000Z	Ben64		when you rent servers from a place, you don't ever see it
2011-04-14T04:58:00.000Z	Ben64		exactly edbian
2011-04-14T04:58:00.000Z	Ben64		server in a home isn't a real server
2011-04-14T04:59:00.000Z	Ben64		nope, sorry
2011-04-14T04:59:00.000Z	Ben64		unless you have 100mbit in your home a hop or two from a major backbone, it's not real
2011-04-14T05:00:00.000Z	itaylor57	Ben64	only 100mb?
2011-04-14T05:00:00.000Z	Ben64	itaylor57	at least
2011-04-14T05:01:00.000Z	itaylor57	Ben64	I have that on my cell phone
2011-04-14T05:01:00.000Z	Ben64	itaylor57	no you don't
2011-04-14T05:03:00.000Z	Ben64	itaylor57	just because you don't like my definition of a server doesn't mean you have a magic 100mbit cell phone connection
2011-04-14T05:04:00.000Z	itaylor57	Ben64	well I can neither confirm or deny what bandwith I have on my cell phone
2011-04-14T05:05:00.000Z	Ben64	itaylor57	you still don't have 100mbit on it
2011-04-14T05:13:00.000Z	itaylor57	Ben64	wiki seems to disagree http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_(computing)
