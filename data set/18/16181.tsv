2005-04-20T11:34:00.000Z	wowzer		one more question, how those it run on a poor HW machine?
2005-04-20T11:35:00.000Z	siimo	wowzer	? does it need X
2005-04-20T11:36:00.000Z	siimo	wowzer	then use a light weight WM like windowmaker or iceWM or even XFCE4
2005-04-20T11:36:00.000Z	siimo	wowzer	i would say 64MB ram on any CPU over 486
2005-04-20T11:38:00.000Z	siimo	wowzer	hate to say it but stick to windows 95 or commandline linux on that machine
2005-04-20T11:38:00.000Z	siimo	wowzer	right no problem with that
2005-04-20T11:40:00.000Z	siimo	wowzer	he is talking about your old machine i think
2005-04-20T11:40:00.000Z	siimo	wowzer	if you really want X on that then you should get debian woody or older
2005-04-20T11:42:00.000Z	siimo	wowzer	Dreamer3, not possible on 133mhz 64mb  get a new system 2nd hand will be sub $100
