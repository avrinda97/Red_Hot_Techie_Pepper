2005-03-02T16:24:00.000Z	thoreauputic	abi_	you can point the cd burn program at the new devices - probably /dev/hdc has become hdd and vice-versa, or somthing similar
2005-03-02T16:24:00.000Z	abi_	thoreauputic	ok. do you know how can i do that for cdrecord?
2005-03-02T16:26:00.000Z	thoreauputic	abi_	no, sorry - but you can scan for it - something like cdrecord dev=ATAPI -scanbus ( I might have that wrong - needs checking )
2005-03-02T16:27:00.000Z	abi_	thoreauputic	i'll try
2005-03-02T16:27:00.000Z	abi_	thoreauputic	tnks
2005-03-02T16:28:00.000Z	thoreauputic	abi_	that seems to give a result here like 2, 2, 2 with a bunch of other rubbish...
2005-03-02T16:29:00.000Z	abi_	thoreauputic	yes, and i get the scsi locations of my cd-rom and cd-rw
2005-03-02T16:29:00.000Z	thoreauputic	abi_	check where your /dev/cdrom link points as well -  ls -l /dev/cdrom
2005-03-02T16:30:00.000Z	abi_	thoreauputic	/dev/cdrom must point to cd reader or to cd writer?
2005-03-02T16:31:00.000Z	thoreauputic	abi_	points to the reader here
2005-03-02T16:31:00.000Z	abi_	thoreauputic	well, now is pointing to writer, how do i change it?
2005-03-02T16:34:00.000Z	abi_	thoreauputic	have changed /dev/cdrom now points to reader
2005-03-02T16:35:00.000Z	thoreauputic	abi_	scizzo is right - you can edit /etc/fstab
2005-03-02T16:35:00.000Z	thoreauputic	abi_	they shouldn't - needs fixing
2005-03-02T16:36:00.000Z	thoreauputic	abi_	those are the mount points
2005-03-02T16:36:00.000Z	thoreauputic	abi_	they need to be different, obviously :)
2005-03-02T16:40:00.000Z	abi_	thoreauputic	thanks
2005-03-02T16:40:00.000Z	thoreauputic	abi_	no problem :)
