2011-05-29T16:31:00.000Z	eze		I am using xubuntu-10.04 on an old PowerPC (Mac G4) and it works really well
2011-05-29T16:31:00.000Z	eze		(in fact, I am chatting from that computer at the moment)
2011-05-29T16:31:00.000Z	dzone	eze	It works pretty well on my PC even from the usb drive
2011-05-29T16:32:00.000Z	eze	dzone	xubuntu is really good. not as flashy as gnome, but gets the job done, and it does not look so rough as openbox/fluxbox/icewm/etc.
2011-05-29T16:32:00.000Z	dzone	eze	It has 1,47 CPU and 256MB RAM with 40GB Hard
2011-05-29T16:33:00.000Z	eze	dzone	it should be fine. 256 Mb is probably the minimum
2011-05-29T16:33:00.000Z	eze	dzone	consider using openbox/fluxbox or something similar
2011-05-29T16:34:00.000Z	eze	dzone	it's really the apps that would then take all your RAM (browser, openoffice, java being the worst)
2011-05-29T16:34:00.000Z	eze	dzone	if you want to be on the cheap, just buy more RAM -- or talk to friends/work colleagues... that's how I got the RAM for my Mac!
2011-05-29T16:35:00.000Z	eze	dzone	(for free!)
2011-05-29T16:35:00.000Z	dzone	eze	sure I know some friends wit PC hardware shops
2011-05-29T16:36:00.000Z	dzone	eze	I'll ask them ;) Thanks!
2011-05-29T16:36:00.000Z	eze	dzone	pozic: as it happens, some people do keep their old computers, and their memory modules... it's always worth asking
2011-05-29T16:36:00.000Z	eze	dzone	pozic: I am totally amazed as how well xubuntu-10.04 runs on this Mac G4
2011-05-29T16:36:00.000Z	dzone	eze	I hope so!
2011-05-29T16:39:00.000Z	eze	dzone	pozic gotta go. good luck, dzone!
2011-05-29T16:40:00.000Z	dzone	eze	Thanks
2011-05-29T16:40:00.000Z	eze	dzone	no probs. see you all...
