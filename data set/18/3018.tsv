2010-01-03T03:48:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	Jovial-Halgar	ask in ##windows considering you're on windows with a windows issue.

2010-01-03T03:50:00.000Z	Jovial-Halgar		i had that newest ubuntu
2010-01-03T03:51:00.000Z	Jovial-Halgar		i think it used ext 4
2010-01-03T03:51:00.000Z	Jovial-Halgar		but i upgraded from the older linux
2010-01-03T03:51:00.000Z	Jovial-Halgar		to the newest ubuntu which i think uses ext4

2010-01-03T03:51:00.000Z	Jovial-Halgar		how do i determine if it uses ext3 or 4
2010-01-03T03:51:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	Jovial-Halgar	might i ask, how is this an issues considering you're on windows? the fs-driver has nothign to do with ubuntu
2010-01-03T03:52:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	Jovial-Halgar	in ubuntu type sudo fdisk -l
2010-01-03T03:52:00.000Z	Jovial-Halgar		well bastid_raZor i'm trying to read the drive from windows
2010-01-03T03:52:00.000Z	Jovial-Halgar		i'm not even sure it is ext4 could be ext3
2010-01-03T03:52:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	Jovial-Halgar	exactly, that is not a ubuntu issue. it is windows. and mount will give you the filesystem type.
2010-01-03T03:53:00.000Z	Jovial-Halgar	bastid_raZor	windows has a mount?
