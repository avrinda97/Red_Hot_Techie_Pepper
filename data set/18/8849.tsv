2007-08-20T09:13:00.000Z	wers		how do I put page numbers on OpenOffice.org word processor?
2007-08-20T09:14:00.000Z	kitche	wers	Insert special characters or soemthing like that then page numbers
2007-11-30T04:45:00.000Z	kitche	wers	no that's how the program works
2007-11-30T04:45:00.000Z	wers	kitche	in the old versions, the plugin settings are saved
2007-11-30T04:45:00.000Z	kitche	wers	well gaim != pidgin is the way it's built
2007-11-30T04:46:00.000Z	wers	kitche	even the old pidgin in feisty savees the settings
2007-11-30T04:46:00.000Z	kitche	wers	then it's how it's built but anyways pidgin has been rebuilt at least twice fromw hat I seen they like to remove a lot of settings are can be enabled in the source cod
2007-11-30T04:47:00.000Z	wers	kitche	actually, I saw a bug report for this issue
2007-11-30T04:48:00.000Z	kitche	wers	find the bug report and see if theres a fix :) I don't tend to use pidgin
2007-11-30T04:49:00.000Z	wers	kitche	https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/pidgin/+bug/149207
2007-11-30T04:51:00.000Z	kitche	wers	just do what the fix says :) seems like when you upgrade to gutsy the permissions are set wrong when you start using gutsy
2007-11-30T04:51:00.000Z	wers	kitche	i don't get it well
2007-11-30T04:52:00.000Z	kitche	wers	it just says nuke ~/.purple
2007-11-30T04:52:00.000Z	kitche	wers	so just delete the .purple folder
2007-11-30T04:52:00.000Z	kitche	wers	then it should work fine
2007-11-30T04:52:00.000Z	wers	kitche	that would delete my IM history :(
2007-11-30T04:53:00.000Z	kitche	wers	you can back it up really seems like only one file needs deleted which it prefs.xml
2007-12-14T07:40:00.000Z	kitche	wers	: you need to enable them though ccsm
