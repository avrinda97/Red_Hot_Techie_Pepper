2009-12-06T12:08:00.000Z	Peaker	dtownhero	the various breakage Koala was released with
2009-12-06T12:08:00.000Z	dtownhero	Peaker	like what?
2009-12-06T12:09:00.000Z	Peaker	dtownhero	My video player set my Hue to -1, which destroyed colors, took me hours to figure out what was wrong.  My sound is broken in a weird way - I get music, but no speech.  Other people have broken installs, etc.
2009-12-06T12:09:00.000Z	dtownhero	Peaker	I have multiple 9.10 installs and am having none of those problems
2009-12-06T12:09:00.000Z	Peaker	dtownhero	did you try playing video with totem?
2009-12-06T12:10:00.000Z	dtownhero	Peaker	I have
2009-12-06T12:10:00.000Z	Peaker	dtownhero	I guess the problems are not trivial then -- I am not the only one who experienced them, though
2009-12-06T12:11:00.000Z	dtownhero	Peaker	would you take these few problems with an open source operating system in which you know they will be fixed, or windows where you know it will take months to fix?
2009-12-06T12:11:00.000Z	Peaker	dtownhero	No need to explain that -- I'd not use any non-opensource system. I just think Koala was released too untested
2009-12-06T12:12:00.000Z	Peaker	dtownhero	I think Ubuntu used to have a focus on "Just working" - and that it changed it's focus and that many Ubuntu users now experience sound not working, and various other problems that earlier Ubuntus did not exhibit
2009-12-06T12:13:00.000Z	Peaker	dtownhero	something like audio is pretty basic (and shouldn't be that complicated, too)
2009-12-06T12:13:00.000Z	Peaker	dtownhero	it should be the first priority to get it fixed..
2009-12-06T12:13:00.000Z	dtownhero	Peaker	there are work arounds for the problems
2009-12-06T12:13:00.000Z	dtownhero	Peaker	at least you're not being infected with virus' and the new Black screen of death.
2009-12-06T12:14:00.000Z	Peaker	dtownhero	I think its really awful that Ubuntu wastes resources on improving compiz, or shortening boot times, etc when many users have trouble getting sound to work consistently out-of-the-box
2009-12-06T12:14:00.000Z	Peaker	dtownhero	again, no need to compare to Windows/etc.  I will stick with Ubuntu anyway
2009-12-06T12:14:00.000Z	Peaker	dtownhero	(or some other Linux distribution, at worst)
2009-12-06T12:16:00.000Z	Peaker	dtownhero	not me..
