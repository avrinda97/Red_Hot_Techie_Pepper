2007-08-01T15:27:00.000Z	act1v8		X on Ubuntu 7.04 LiveCD looks like it doesn't find the resolution of my monitor on a laptop. The resolution should be 1280x800 but in /etc/X11/xorg.conf the resolution is 1024x786 but I can't see a thing on the screen! The screen is turned off when I'm on console 7, on console 1 I see the terminal. Help!

2007-08-01T15:28:00.000Z	act1v8	howlingmadhowi1	the Radeon driver "ati"
2007-08-01T15:29:00.000Z	act1v8	howlingmadhowi1	but if X isn't starting shouldn't I see a terminal at console 7 ?
2007-08-01T15:29:00.000Z	howlingmadhowi1	act1v8	mm, as far as i know, the ati driver looks at xorg.conf to find out what it should be doing. you could try manually editing xorg.conf to include the graphics modes of your monitor and then restarting the x-server
2007-08-01T15:30:00.000Z	howlingmadhowi1	act1v8	nope
2007-08-01T15:30:00.000Z	act1v8	howlingmadhowi1	I tried that. nothing
2007-08-01T15:31:00.000Z	howlingmadhowi1	act1v8	did you check the default depth? what happens if you change the driver from "ati" to "vesa"? does x-windows start?
2007-08-01T15:31:00.000Z	act1v8	howlingmadhowi1	let me try
2007-08-01T15:32:00.000Z	act1v8	howlingmadhowi1	yes. I see gdm now :)
2007-08-01T15:33:00.000Z	act1v8	howlingmadhowi1	it's just that the whole screen is streched and fuzzy... shouldn't it be sharp and crisp?
2007-08-01T15:43:00.000Z	act1v8	howlingmadhowi1	I can't switch to resolution 1280x800... it always displays at 1024x786
2007-08-01T15:46:00.000Z	act1v8	howlingmadhowi1	can I use another driver... that supports higher resolutions ?
2007-08-01T15:51:00.000Z	howlingmadhowi1	act1v8	sorry. my flatmate needed some help. i'm back now. a further possibility is that the refresh rates in xorg.conf aren't high enough
2007-08-01T15:52:00.000Z	act1v8	howlingmadhowi1	from what I saw in windows, the screen's max refresh rate is 60Hz but in System > Pref. > Screen Resolution it says 61Hz which is impossible
2007-08-01T15:57:00.000Z	howlingmadhowi1	act1v8	there's also the possibility that the gnome window manager is limiting your resolution. have a look here:
2007-08-01T15:59:00.000Z	act1v8	howlingmadhowi1	where?
