2006-05-21T09:07:00.000Z	CokeNCode	Flannel	cool, thanks
2006-06-05T12:00:00.000Z	Flannel	CokeNCode	no it's not.  ubuntu has nothing listening by default.
2006-06-05T12:00:00.000Z	CokeNCode	Flannel	oops ... well, i guess i configured it to listen ... and forgot about it somehow ... :/
2006-06-23T08:11:00.000Z	Flannel	CokeNCode	nope
2006-06-23T08:12:00.000Z	Flannel	CokeNCode	nope, xchat-gnome, xchat is in universe in dapper
2006-06-23T08:12:00.000Z	Flannel	CokeNCode	however, searching for xchat shouldve found xchat-gnome
2006-06-23T08:12:00.000Z	CokeNCode	Flannel	ok, i thought that was some kinda mistake
2006-06-23T08:12:00.000Z	CokeNCode	Flannel	now ... what about Automatix
2006-06-23T08:13:00.000Z	Flannel	CokeNCode	easyubuntu information can be found in #easyubuntu though
2006-08-24T15:14:00.000Z	Flannel	CokeNCode	which part of the program?
2006-09-11T05:34:00.000Z	Flannel	CokeNCode	make space for windows, then install, then recover your grub : help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows
2007-09-02T05:25:00.000Z	Flannel	CokeNCode	Audacity?
2009-03-15T23:51:00.000Z	Flannel	CokeNCode	Try centerim if you're looking for a ncurses messenger (or finch, which uses libpurple)
2009-03-15T23:53:00.000Z	Flannel	CokeNCode	I've never used it.
