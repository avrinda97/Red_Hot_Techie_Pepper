2005-08-10T07:57:00.000Z	spanglesontoast		hey
2005-08-10T07:58:00.000Z	spanglesontoast		does rdesktop need any special settings
2005-08-10T07:59:00.000Z	jowi	spanglesontoast	are you talking about tsclient or vino-server?
2005-08-10T07:59:00.000Z	jowi	spanglesontoast	well, you can allow client to connect but not control your desktop. you can set password as well
2005-08-10T08:00:00.000Z	jowi	spanglesontoast	yes you can
2005-08-10T08:00:00.000Z	jowi	spanglesontoast	but you can also allow them to see but not touch
2005-08-10T08:00:00.000Z	jowi	spanglesontoast	run vino-preferences
2005-08-10T08:01:00.000Z	jowi	spanglesontoast	you need to set realvnc to connect as VNC and not RDP
2005-08-10T08:01:00.000Z	jowi	spanglesontoast	it supports both as far as i can remember
2005-08-10T08:03:00.000Z	jowi	spanglesontoast	it should.
2005-08-10T08:05:00.000Z	jowi	spanglesontoast	and in "server" you should put "ip.address:0" i think. it was a while ago i used it (a couple of years)
2005-08-10T08:07:00.000Z	jowi	spanglesontoast	you should check realvnc.com
2005-08-10T08:08:00.000Z	jowi	spanglesontoast	try "ip.add.ress:5600"
2005-08-10T08:09:00.000Z	jowi	spanglesontoast	it should.
2005-08-10T08:10:00.000Z	jowi	spanglesontoast	ah no you're right. it uses 5900 as standard
2005-08-10T08:10:00.000Z	jowi	spanglesontoast	silly me
2005-08-10T08:13:00.000Z	jowi	spanglesontoast	nope. vino and normal vnc runs on 5900. BUT vino-server only starts when a user logs in to gnome so only port 5900 is in use. for a "normal" vnc server like tightvnc the server is started for each screen (5901, 5902 etc)
2005-08-10T08:24:00.000Z	jowi	spanglesontoast	do you have the ubuntubox nearby?
