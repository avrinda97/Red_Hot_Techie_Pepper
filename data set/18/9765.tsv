2009-02-26T23:31:00.000Z	Stevethepirate		Or not.
2009-02-26T23:33:00.000Z	Stevethepirate		Where would I drop a networking based script that has to be run on startup before anything on the PC actually touches the networking modules [ghosting a MAC here]
2009-02-26T23:35:00.000Z	Stevethepirate		No
2009-02-26T23:35:00.000Z	Stevethepirate		I mean spoofing a MAC
2009-02-26T23:35:00.000Z	Stevethepirate		*sigh*
2009-02-26T23:36:00.000Z	Stevethepirate		Normally i would go sudo ifconfig eth0 down && sudo ifconfig hw ether de:ad:be:ef:ca:fe && sudo ifconfig eth0 up
2009-02-26T23:37:00.000Z	Stevethepirate		But I would like that to be run before my pc connects  to the network
2009-02-26T23:39:00.000Z	Stevethepirate		SURELY LINUX WONT MAKE IT 1-0 TO WINDOWS
2009-02-26T23:39:00.000Z	Stevethepirate		:D
2009-02-26T23:40:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Stevethepirate	Linux distros are not Windows, and  Windows is the OS of choice by most computer users, because of the monoplolgy and their computer ignorance
2009-02-27T00:03:00.000Z	Stevethepirate	sebsebseb	I've checked out firestarter oke.
2009-02-27T00:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Stevethepirate	Firestarter maybe you don't really need it
2009-02-27T00:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Stevethepirate	have you got a hardware firewall?
2009-02-27T00:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Stevethepirate	if you got a router you probably got one as part of that
2009-02-27T00:04:00.000Z	Stevethepirate	sebsebseb	No hardware firewall.. Internet -> This PC with 2 network cards <-> switch <-> clients
2009-02-27T00:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Stevethepirate	ok find out about iptables as well then
2009-02-27T00:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Stevethepirate	ok I don't know
