2010-01-18T05:50:00.000Z	{chmod}755	datz	What's up?
2010-01-18T05:50:00.000Z	datz	{chmod}755	I tried the magnifier at the login screen and everything froze
2010-01-18T05:50:00.000Z	{chmod}755	datz	Did you try a reboot?
2010-01-18T05:51:00.000Z	datz	{chmod}755	yes
2010-01-18T05:51:00.000Z	{chmod}755	datz	What happened?
2010-01-18T05:52:00.000Z	{chmod}755	datz	run init 1 and kill process.
2010-01-18T05:53:00.000Z	datz	{chmod}755	kill xorg?
2010-01-18T05:53:00.000Z	{chmod}755	datz	Well, when you runlevel 1 xorg won't be active anymore.
2010-01-18T05:54:00.000Z	datz	{chmod}755	I don
2010-01-18T05:55:00.000Z	datz	{chmod}755	"sudo init 1 kill process"
2010-01-18T05:56:00.000Z	{chmod}755	datz	One second? I'm not real familiar with this issue so I'm trying to remember what all needs to be done.
2010-01-18T05:56:00.000Z	datz	{chmod}755	ok, I've tried sudo service gdm stop
2010-01-18T05:56:00.000Z	{chmod}755	datz	You have compiz installed/running?
2010-01-18T05:57:00.000Z	datz	{chmod}755	I would assume
2010-01-18T05:57:00.000Z	{chmod}755	datz	any success when you disable it?
2010-01-18T05:57:00.000Z	datz	{chmod}755	not sure how would I do such?
2010-01-18T05:57:00.000Z	datz	{chmod}755	I guess what I'd need to do is kill gdm and restor xorg.conf
