2012-10-15T20:51:00.000Z	michealPW	LarrysDesk	So I think you're on the right track. grub-install /dev/sdb1 should do it. Double check the manual for grub-install though to make sure you're not missing any important switches (man grub-install)
2012-10-15T20:52:00.000Z	michealPW		Oh, he's using gnome tweak, I guess, trying to set everything to use Ambiance? I can't figure much out in that screenshot 'cause I can't read the language Safa_[A_boy] :|
2012-10-15T20:52:00.000Z	michealPW		Sorry.
2012-10-15T20:53:00.000Z	LarrysDesk	michealPW	Hi.  I'm booted on my laptop (running another OS) to the Ubuntu Installer CD, with an *external* HD attached.  I'm doing an Ubuntu install to that HD.  @ the "bootloader" section of the install, I hit ctrl-alt-f2, and want to install the bootloader to the MBR in the right part of that external HD.  Iiuc, it goes to the "separate boot" partition @ /dev/sdb1, *NOT* the disk itself @ /dev/sdb.  right?
2012-10-15T20:55:00.000Z	michealPW	LarrysDesk	Oh, okay! Well, correct. I think you're right. I'm not an expert, though, just to warn you... What you say makes perfect sense. If you select /dev/sdb it will put it in that drive's MBR not the partition you created. If you use /dev/sdb1 it will put it in the partition you've created, though.
2012-10-15T20:56:00.000Z	LarrysDesk	michealPW	I guess my question then should also be -- where SHOULD i put it?  in the MBR, or the boot partition?  I want to make sure that when I detach this drive from the laptop, and put it (eventually) into a new machine, it'll boot correctly.
2012-10-15T20:57:00.000Z	michealPW	LarrysDesk	Ah, well I would THINK you should put it in /dev/sdb, the MBR. That way if you detach it and re-attach to another computer, without changing anything on that computer it's BIOS will find GRUB and let you easily boot from it.
2012-10-15T20:57:00.000Z	michealPW		Again.. I'm not an expert, though :P
2012-10-15T20:58:00.000Z	michealPW		If you put GRUB in a partition, though, I think you'll need to do chainloading (Say, put Windows' BOOTMGR in the MBR and create an entry in BOOTMGR that points to your partition with GRUB in it.)
2012-10-15T20:59:00.000Z	michealPW	LarrysDesk	The point of the MBR is that it's the first 2048 bytes of the hard disk. It's where a BIOS will automatically look for an operating system (In this case, GRUB.)
2012-10-15T20:59:00.000Z	LarrysDesk	michealPW	If BIOS "looks" at the MBR of disks, then I think that's what I want ...
2012-10-15T21:00:00.000Z	michealPW	LarrysDesk	Indeed! I think that will give you the most flexability in using that removable drive on different PCs without changing anything on the PC. Like on mine, if you plugged it in when I start my computer I could press F12 and see it in the list without changing anything, then select it and up comes Ubuntu :P
2012-10-15T21:01:00.000Z	LarrysDesk		hm.  I was instructed to use "grub-install".  When I try, though, it says "grub-install: not found".  THere *IS* a "grub-installer".  Same thing?
2012-10-15T21:01:00.000Z	LarrysDesk	michealPW	ok, thanks!
2012-10-15T21:01:00.000Z	michealPW		That's weird. It's grub-install here, I think *checks*
2012-10-15T21:02:00.000Z	michealPW		grub-install (GRUB) 1.99-21ubuntu3.4
2012-10-15T21:02:00.000Z	michealPW		grub-install -v ^^
2012-10-15T21:03:00.000Z	LarrysDesk	michealPW	here "grub-installer -v" --> BusyBox v1.18.5 (Ubuntu 1:1.18.5-1ubuntu14) multi-call binary."
