2007-02-16T08:49:00.000Z	bruenig	aZu	link to the package
2007-02-16T08:51:00.000Z	bruenig	aZu	if you would link to the package, I can take a look...
2007-02-16T08:53:00.000Z	bruenig	aZu	link to the website where you downloaded it
2007-02-16T08:55:00.000Z	bruenig	aZu	so you did sudo ./install-binary
2007-02-16T08:56:00.000Z	bruenig	aZu	and it said?
2007-02-16T08:56:00.000Z	bruenig	aZu	yeah it did that here too. There must be a flaw in the script
2007-02-16T08:58:00.000Z	bruenig	aZu	that is essentially what you are doing, the install script is flawed though. It is not really anything you can do. I am looking at it to see if I can figure it out. I am not the greatest in complex bash scripts although this one looks rather simple
2007-02-16T09:09:00.000Z	bruenig	aZu	yeah you can use the autogen script to compile or you can try at least
