2007-09-23T07:13:00.000Z	shad0w1e		I remember having to download a bunch of codecs and extracting them into the codec directory..
2007-09-23T07:14:00.000Z	shad0w1e		hey does anyone know a good distro (with a decent UI, preferably XFCE) for a AMD 350mhz laptop with 96mb ram? Damn Small is kind of not enough.. thanks
2007-09-23T07:14:00.000Z	sn0	shad0w1e	any distro really, try fluxbox or another of the lighter window environments
2007-09-23T07:15:00.000Z	shad0w1e	sn0	what I like about Ubuntu is that it's newb friendly, automatic updates, nice installer, etc. I'd like a similiar setup, but with XFCE, I suppose. Fluxbox is kind of not enough
2007-09-23T07:15:00.000Z	shad0w1e		Will Xubuntu do all that?
2007-09-23T07:15:00.000Z	shad0w1e		ahh nice
2007-09-23T07:15:00.000Z	shad0w1e		this is for someone coming from wnidows
2007-09-23T07:15:00.000Z	sn0		xubuntu:)
2007-09-23T07:16:00.000Z	shad0w1e		want to be able to show them some basic stuff and have them be on their own
2007-09-23T07:16:00.000Z	shad0w1e		kool, thanks people
2007-09-23T07:16:00.000Z	sn0		maybe check out lighter weight browsers and applications too shad0w1e
2007-09-23T07:16:00.000Z	sn0		as firefox tends to use lots of ram :)
2007-09-23T07:16:00.000Z	shad0w1e		yeah firefox is a hog
2007-09-23T07:17:00.000Z	shad0w1e		but it works with every page...
2007-09-23T07:17:00.000Z	shad0w1e		(almost)
2007-09-23T07:17:00.000Z	sn0		i find opera/ ephiphany to be quite light weight ( depends on load really ) but at my mums i use a k6-2 350 with 128meg ram and it runs great with opera
2007-09-23T07:17:00.000Z	shad0w1e	sn0	pretty much my setup, a drop less ram. thanks opera might be good
