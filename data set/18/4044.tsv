2009-06-06T13:49:00.000Z	TheHurricane		can someone please give me a little help...i`m kinde newbe ..
2009-06-06T13:50:00.000Z	Alex__________	TheHurricane	Well, we can try =P
2009-06-06T13:51:00.000Z	Alex__________	TheHurricane	you mean like minimize, maximize, exit etc?
2009-06-06T13:52:00.000Z	Alex__________	TheHurricane	try this... open a terminal and type "metacity --replace" (Without the quotes)
2009-06-06T13:55:00.000Z	Alex__________	TheHurricane	Um... well...
2009-06-06T13:56:00.000Z	Alex__________	TheHurricane	Do you have compizconfig settings manager installed?
2009-06-06T14:05:00.000Z	Alex__________	TheHurricane	Do you have compiz settings manager installed?
2009-06-06T14:06:00.000Z	Alex__________	TheHurricane	sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager
2009-06-06T14:09:00.000Z	Alex__________	TheHurricane	type ccsm &
2009-06-06T14:15:00.000Z	Alex__________	TheHurricane	What I wanted you to try was to unclick "Window Decoration" then log out and back in... that MIGHT fix it.
2009-06-06T14:20:00.000Z	Alex__________	TheHurricane	It kinda sounds like there is something wrong with metacity, but I'm not sure what to tell you to fix it... And the other effects part... are you on normal or extra effects?
2009-06-06T14:22:00.000Z	Alex__________	TheHurricane	I meant that some of the effects that you were saying weren't changing anything... you have to be on extra for most of them
2009-06-06T14:23:00.000Z	Alex__________	TheHurricane	The window border part the only thing I can think of is that your metacity is corrupted or broken or something...
2009-06-06T14:23:00.000Z	Alex__________	TheHurricane	Just to get something you could try putting an emerald theme... just so you have SOMETHING...
2009-06-06T14:24:00.000Z	Alex__________	TheHurricane	First sudo apt-get install emerald
2009-06-06T14:27:00.000Z	Alex__________	TheHurricane	Find a theme you like http://www.gnome-look.org/index.php?xsortmode=high&page=0&xcontentmode=103 and download it.
2009-06-06T14:32:00.000Z	Alex__________	TheHurricane	once it's been imported and selected type in a terminal emerald --replace
