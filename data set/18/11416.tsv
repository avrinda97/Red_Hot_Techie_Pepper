2007-10-31T17:37:00.000Z	burwaco	jrib	now that you're talking about runlevels and stuff, is it normal that a non-free flashplugin is in rcS on my machine ?
2007-10-31T17:43:00.000Z	jrib	burwaco	not here, but what does 'dpkg -S /etc/rcS.d/S99flashplugin-nonfree' say?
2007-10-31T17:45:00.000Z	burwaco	jrib	dpkg: /etc/rcS.d/S99flashplugin-nonfree not found.... weird...
2007-10-31T17:46:00.000Z	burwaco	jrib	can I safely remove it ?
2007-10-31T17:47:00.000Z	jrib	burwaco	how about 'readlink -f /etc/rcS.d/S99flashplugin-nonfree' ?
2007-10-31T17:47:00.000Z	burwaco	jrib	/etc/init.d/flashplugin-nonfree
2007-10-31T17:47:00.000Z	jrib	burwaco	and 'dpkg -S /etc/init.d/flashplugin-nonfree'?
2007-10-31T17:48:00.000Z	burwaco	jrib	way ahead... :)
2007-10-31T17:49:00.000Z	burwaco	jrib	it stalls 30 seconds, then says flashplugin-nonfree: /etc/init.d/flashplugin-nonfree
2007-10-31T17:50:00.000Z	jrib	burwaco	I would just leave it... you can read the inside and see what it does
2007-10-31T17:53:00.000Z	burwaco	jrib	according to dpkq flashplugin-nonfree is not installed anymore, can I just delete the link in rcS ?
2007-10-31T17:53:00.000Z	jrib	burwaco	sure
2007-10-31T17:57:00.000Z	jrib	burwaco	read comments in /etc/xdg/user-dirs.defaults
2007-10-31T17:58:00.000Z	jrib	burwaco	and /etc/xdg/user-dirs.conf ...
2007-10-31T17:59:00.000Z	burwaco	jrib	it behaves like aliasses in apache.conf ?
2007-10-31T18:00:00.000Z	jrib	burwaco	I don't know about aliases in apache so I couldn't say
2007-10-31T18:02:00.000Z	burwaco	jrib	"the values are relative pathnames" where will you see or use these values ? in bash (mv file MUSIC moves file to /home/user/Music ???)
2007-10-31T18:05:00.000Z	jrib	burwaco	http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/xdg-user-dirs is the idea.  Basically, you get localized directories so apps can look for a "music" directory even if it is named "musica".  The .conf file lets you disable it if you do not like it
