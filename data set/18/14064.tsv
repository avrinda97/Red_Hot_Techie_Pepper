2005-09-23T11:10:00.000Z	fooboy		ok thanks
2005-09-23T11:10:00.000Z	Earthen	fooboy	I actully have both installed, in a nut shell i think ease of setup is the big differnace, ubuntu maybe an hour to get everything up and running  and gentoo took me about a week,,mide you unce it up it is great eveything ic compiled for you system
2005-09-23T11:11:00.000Z	fooboy		with which distro?
2005-09-23T11:12:00.000Z	fooboy		d/w
2005-09-23T11:13:00.000Z	fooboy		yes ompaul that is correct
2005-09-23T11:13:00.000Z	Earthen	fooboy	I have gentoo for server and ubuntu for desktop at home
2005-09-23T11:13:00.000Z	fooboy	Earthen	thanks
2005-09-23T11:14:00.000Z	fooboy		whats seprates ubuntu from debain apart from ease of install?
2005-09-23T11:14:00.000Z	Earthen	fooboy	my main reasionfor going with gentoo with the server was for the amd 64 bit, since everything is compiled most everythign works in gentoo on 64 bit
2005-09-23T11:16:00.000Z	fooboy	Earthen	cool i dont have a 64 bit a have a pentium 4 with gentoo and a celron 2.2GHZ with ubuntu
2005-09-23T11:16:00.000Z	fooboy		With ubuntu/debain i seem to need alot of holes in my firewall
2005-09-23T11:17:00.000Z	fooboy		for updates
2005-09-23T11:17:00.000Z	fooboy		for updates is their anyway i could proxy these
2005-09-23T11:17:00.000Z	Earthen	fooboy	then if i were you i would stick with ubuntu for now, I still pretty much a noob at this all and beleave me Ubuntu is much easer to get you feel wet. Gentoo is like running into a cliff
