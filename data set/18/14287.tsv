2011-06-16T12:55:00.000Z	DJHenjin		the emc2 site made it very clear that it was a bad idea to do a dist upgrade or update after install
2011-06-16T12:55:00.000Z	DJHenjin		because it would break emc2
2011-06-16T12:56:00.000Z	DJHenjin		and i need to keep my emc2 config for my machine because its a custom built machine and i cant remember the pinout
2011-06-16T12:57:00.000Z	DJHenjin		not the computer... the bloody machine EMC2 is for controlling
2011-06-16T12:58:00.000Z	DJHenjin		lol
2011-06-16T12:58:00.000Z	DJHenjin		tried that
2011-06-16T12:59:00.000Z	DJHenjin		no dice
2011-06-16T12:59:00.000Z	DJHenjin		not easily
2011-06-16T13:01:00.000Z	DJHenjin		so?
2011-06-16T13:02:00.000Z	DJHenjin		ctrl alt F1 did nothing
2011-06-16T13:02:00.000Z	guzu	DJHenjin	ctrl-alt-f2?
2011-06-16T13:05:00.000Z	guzu	DJHenjin	roger
2011-06-16T13:13:00.000Z	guzu	DJHenjin	recovery mode is available?
2011-06-16T13:14:00.000Z	guzu	DJHenjin	your problem is that once x is started, the thing freezes? (sorry, i was not here at the beginning)
2011-06-16T14:05:00.000Z	guzu	DJHenjin	anywhere
2011-06-16T14:06:00.000Z	guzu	DJHenjin	yes
2011-06-16T14:06:00.000Z	guzu	DJHenjin	and it "fixes" ist until reboot
2011-06-16T14:22:00.000Z	guzu	DJHenjin	if it doesn't work, you'll have to look at log files using a live cd, and/or passing more esoteric bootparams to the kernel
