2009-10-28T04:36:00.000Z	bradland		Noob question about starting services
2009-10-28T04:36:00.000Z	bradland		I just installed Ntop according to this guide: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Ntop
2009-10-28T04:36:00.000Z	bradland		at the end, they specify that you should restart the service with `sudo ntop -u ntop -d`
2009-10-28T04:36:00.000Z	bradland		There is an init script in /etc/init.d/ntop, however
2009-10-28T04:37:00.000Z	bradland		Shouldn't I use the init script whenever possible?
2009-10-28T04:39:00.000Z	ebb	bradland	I would say use the init scrips
2009-10-28T04:39:00.000Z	bradland		thx ebb
2009-10-28T04:40:00.000Z	ebb	bradland	I always have on gentoo/arch
2009-10-28T04:40:00.000Z	bradland		would it be poor form for me to update that page with `/etc/init.d/ntop start` ?
2009-10-28T04:40:00.000Z	bradland		I mean, if you ran `sudo ntop -u ntop -d`, you're going to start the service as root, no?
2009-10-28T04:40:00.000Z	bradland		that's very bad
2009-10-28T04:41:00.000Z	ebb	bradland	yep
2009-10-28T04:41:00.000Z	ebb	bradland	alot of services have there own user account to run themselfs
2009-10-28T04:42:00.000Z	bradland		Yeah, the Ubuntu package even creates a user (ntop) for the service to run under
2009-10-28T04:42:00.000Z	bradland		the suggestion on that page is really bad
2009-10-28T04:42:00.000Z	bradland		i'm going to create an account and edit it
2009-10-28T04:45:00.000Z	bradland	ebb	Thanks for the clarification. That was officially my first contribution to the Linux community, haha :)
2009-10-28T04:46:00.000Z	ebb	bradland	great :D
