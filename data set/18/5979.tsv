2008-09-17T15:49:00.000Z	Bend0r	ActionParsnip	i dont get anything about whats written there... it just should work..
2008-09-17T15:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Bend0r	not if youo dont have the module
2008-09-17T15:50:00.000Z	Bend0r	ActionParsnip	i do
2008-09-17T15:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Bend0r	run lsmod
2008-09-17T15:51:00.000Z	Bend0r	ActionParsnip	k....

2008-09-17T15:58:00.000Z	Bend0r	ActionParsnip	now?
2008-09-17T15:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Bend0r	do you see the module listed?
2008-09-17T16:00:00.000Z	Bend0r	ActionParsnip	no :/
2008-09-17T16:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Bend0r	then it wont "just work"
2008-09-17T16:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Bend0r	you need to find what gives that module (or how to compile it)
2008-09-17T16:06:00.000Z	Bend0r	ActionParsnip	i see.. sudo apt-get install build-essential gcc make mercurial linux-headers-`uname -r` should do that... but it gives me E: Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (11 Resource temporarily unavailable)
2008-09-17T16:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Bend0r	you got synaptic open etc?
2008-09-17T16:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Bend0r	you could reboot
2008-09-17T16:09:00.000Z	Bend0r	ActionParsnip	ok synaptic was open.. now i get another err: Errors were encountered while processing:
2008-09-17T16:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Bend0r	try a reboot
