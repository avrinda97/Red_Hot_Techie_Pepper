2010-10-30T00:56:00.000Z	Cheery	StrikerST	okay.
2010-10-30T00:56:00.000Z	Cheery	StrikerST	WUBI, not WIBI?
2010-10-30T00:58:00.000Z	StrikerST	Cheery	I am stuck in a grub shell and I have no idea what to do =/
2010-10-30T00:58:00.000Z	Cheery	StrikerST	yeah. got it. does it tell you anything?
2010-10-30T00:59:00.000Z	StrikerST	Cheery	no it says grub>
2010-10-30T01:01:00.000Z	Cheery	StrikerST	I've never had to handle grub> but lets see.

2010-10-30T01:05:00.000Z	Cheery	StrikerST	I don't know, though lets read on that link..
2010-10-30T01:06:00.000Z	Cheery	StrikerST	are you in front of your grub shell now?
2010-10-30T01:07:00.000Z	Cheery	StrikerST	if so. you could try out ls /
2010-10-30T01:09:00.000Z	Cheery	StrikerST	linux -command with a kernel file loads the kernel. that might help for now.
2010-10-30T01:10:00.000Z	Cheery	StrikerST	what does the ls / give you?
2010-10-30T01:14:00.000Z	Cheery	StrikerST	never been in that mode myself so I guess not able to help you. You have to wait but it seems this channel has quite quiet tone here.
2010-10-30T01:15:00.000Z	Cheery	StrikerST	broken installation.
2010-10-30T01:19:00.000Z	Cheery	StrikerST	It feels silly a linux installation gets 'fixed' by itself. but seems it happens then.
2010-10-30T01:20:00.000Z	Cheery	StrikerST	I'd look up whats wrong. look up into /var/log
