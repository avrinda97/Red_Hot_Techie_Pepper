2008-04-06T12:33:00.000Z	ikm	tonyyarusso	ahh ok, how long it will take? this is my first time to install linux in text base mode? is there any command or it will install automatically?
2008-04-06T12:33:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ikm	the time depends on your computer.  Just follow the prompts.
2008-04-06T12:34:00.000Z	ikm	tonyyarusso	thanks dear
2008-04-06T14:40:00.000Z	ikm	tonyyarusso	  i am installing ubuntu 7.10 with alternate CD, giving country name and keyboard layout it shows a BLUE screen and from the last 25 minutes nothing happend, isthis normal? should i wait more?
2008-04-06T14:41:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ikm	well, you can wait a bit more, but that doesn't sound good.  Did you run the integrity check yet on the CD?
2008-04-06T14:41:00.000Z	ikm	tonyyarusso	NOT YET
2008-04-06T14:42:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ikm	hmm, might be one thing you could try to attempt a diagnosis.
2008-04-06T14:42:00.000Z	ikm	tonyyarusso	: ok dear thnkx

2008-04-06T14:50:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	ikm	no, that just means your CD is being mounted.
2008-04-06T14:50:00.000Z	ikm	tonyyarusso	so i restart pc and cheke CD for errors?
2008-04-06T14:51:00.000Z	ikm	tonyyarusso	 this is strange, i was able to install ubuntu live CD on my machine before, but not now and alternate CD also didn't work for me .. why is that? :(
