2011-01-22T10:49:00.000Z	busybee		hello can someone help me setup a dual monitor ? I tried changing the nvidia x server settings, but can;t get to activate both the monitors at the same time
2011-01-22T10:51:00.000Z	izinucs	busybee	is one a tv?
2011-01-22T10:53:00.000Z	busybee	izinucs	its a lcd monitor
2011-01-22T10:54:00.000Z	izinucs	busybee	and the other is a laptop?
2011-01-22T10:54:00.000Z	busybee	izinucs	Yup
2011-01-22T10:55:00.000Z	izinucs	busybee	are you using nvidia-settings?
2011-01-22T10:55:00.000Z	busybee	izinucs	Yes I do
2011-01-22T10:55:00.000Z	izinucs	busybee	is that what you've been using trying to activate the 2nd monitor?
2011-01-22T10:56:00.000Z	busybee	izinucs	Yes
2011-01-22T10:57:00.000Z	busybee		Izinucs: nvidia settings overwrites the xorg.conf file in /etc. Is there something else I am supposed to do ?
2011-01-22T10:57:00.000Z	izinucs	busybee	how did you install the nvidia driver with the one in System>Admin>hardware drivers or did you do it manually after downloading from nvidia?
2011-01-22T10:58:00.000Z	busybee	izinucs	i believe i did it from  rpmfusion as a repo
2011-01-22T10:58:00.000Z	busybee		not the actual source
2011-01-22T10:59:00.000Z	izinucs	busybee	I don't know that repo.. personally I use a PPA designed for ubuntu.. x-swat .. nvidia-settings when done right *will* create entries in xorg.conf.. initially there isn't anything in there because of the neuvou (sp?) driver and xrandr..
2011-01-22T11:01:00.000Z	busybee	izinucs	I just got the monitor yesterday. I will try installing from nvidia website
2011-01-22T11:01:00.000Z	izinucs	busybee	could be that repo didn't configure the install correctly by disabling the opensource driver correctly.. x-swat will.  you're in for a nightmare if you try from the nvidia website.. it's not like it was 2-3 releases ago when it was easy
2011-01-22T11:03:00.000Z	izinucs	busybee	here's a how to.. http://www.unixmen.com/software/1365-nvidia-2601926-driver-for-linux-is-released-installation-instructions-and-ppa-included
