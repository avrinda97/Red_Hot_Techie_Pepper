2010-01-29T14:38:00.000Z	DVS01		i use postfix. when i installed at, it ended up installing courier, which overwrote my newliases executable. after removing courier, newaliases no longer exists. what would be the best way to replace the file, which comes with postfix?
2010-01-29T14:38:00.000Z	DVS01		should i reinstall postfix?
2010-01-29T14:40:00.000Z	llutz	DVS01	why not dovecot?
2010-01-29T14:40:00.000Z	DVS01	llutz	i use dovecot
2010-01-29T14:41:00.000Z	DVS01	llutz	dovecot is imap, postfix is smtp
2010-01-29T14:41:00.000Z	llutz	DVS01	courier...
2010-01-29T14:41:00.000Z	DVS01	llutz	what about courier?
2010-01-29T14:42:00.000Z	llutz	DVS01	you wrote you used courier, that's why i asked why not using dovecot
2010-01-29T14:42:00.000Z	DVS01		oh. no, installing at caused courier to get installed
2010-01-29T14:43:00.000Z	DVS01		i was already using dovecot
2010-01-29T14:44:00.000Z	llutz	DVS01	but to answer your question, you should reinstall postfix for newaliases
2010-01-29T14:44:00.000Z	DVS01	llutz	yup. i did that. worked :D
2010-01-29T14:45:00.000Z	DVS01		heh
2010-01-29T14:45:00.000Z	DVS01		this is gonna be fun
2010-01-29T14:46:00.000Z	DVS01		i did a manual tarball installation of mailscanner with spamassassin and clamav
2010-01-29T14:46:00.000Z	DVS01		now i realize that it would be much more organized to use the packages
2010-01-29T14:46:00.000Z	DVS01		so now i gotta locate all these files and delete them and then install mailscanner from the package :P
2010-01-29T14:46:00.000Z	llutz	DVS01	it's better to use native packages in most cases
