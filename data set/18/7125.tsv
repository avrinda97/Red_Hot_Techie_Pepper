2008-02-04T21:24:00.000Z	tomd	nakerlund	$ lsmod | grep snd
2008-02-04T21:25:00.000Z	tomd	nakerlund	lsmod | grep ac97
2008-02-04T21:26:00.000Z	tomd	nakerlund	see if the module is loaded, then we can continue determining why your sound does not work properly
2008-02-04T21:32:00.000Z	tomd	nakerlund	how are your speakers connected?
2008-02-04T21:32:00.000Z	tomd	nakerlund	no, I didn't ask if they were connected
2008-02-04T21:32:00.000Z	tomd	nakerlund	I asked where you pluged them in
2008-02-04T21:32:00.000Z	tomd	nakerlund	just because something works in windows doesn't mean it will work in linux.
2008-02-04T21:33:00.000Z	nakerlund	tomd	sorry I missread, they are connected in the port... I'm not sure exactly what it is called
2008-02-04T21:33:00.000Z	tomd	nakerlund	I had put my headphones in a front port before on windows and it worked, later I discovered it was using software emulation or something to put the sound on that port... I had to connect it with a wire inside my computer for it to work under linux.
2008-02-04T21:34:00.000Z	tomd	nakerlund	well is it the port directly on the sound card?
2008-02-04T21:35:00.000Z	nakerlund	tomd	I don't have a front port.. only the one mounted directly on the board
2008-02-04T21:35:00.000Z	tomd	nakerlund	ah, laptop?
2008-02-04T21:35:00.000Z	tomd	nakerlund	volume control by default I don't think shows you every switch.
2008-02-04T21:36:00.000Z	tomd	nakerlund	what are you playing a sound with to check?
2008-02-04T21:38:00.000Z	tomd	nakerlund	how are you testing the sound? what are you attempting to play sound with?
2008-02-04T21:39:00.000Z	nakerlund	tomd	I'm testing my sound in "sound preferences"
2008-02-04T21:40:00.000Z	tomd	nakerlund	have you selected alsa for all the choices?
