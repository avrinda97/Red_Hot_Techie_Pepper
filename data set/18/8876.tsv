2008-04-29T18:56:00.000Z	knifepoint	phaidros	marvelous :P
2008-04-29T18:57:00.000Z	phaidros	knifepoint	yeah .. got tired after two days searchinf :/
2008-04-29T18:58:00.000Z	knifepoint	phaidros	wish i could swap it out for an nvidia or intel chip... i know what im looking for next laptop purchase
2008-04-29T18:59:00.000Z	phaidros	knifepoint	nope. my dell with nvidia isn't much more fun anyway ..
2008-04-29T18:59:00.000Z	knifepoint	phaidros	oh fair enough then must've got lucky with my desktops 7600 its never had a hiccup
2008-04-29T19:00:00.000Z	phaidros	knifepoint	desktop no problem, even dualhead, nut *only* with same resolutuion. but with suspend & hibernate it is a nightmare ..
2008-04-29T19:02:00.000Z	knifepoint	phaidros	oh i gave up on linux supporting suspend and hibernate years ago
2008-04-29T19:02:00.000Z	phaidros	knifepoint	well, worked well in between sometimes :)
2008-04-29T19:03:00.000Z	phaidros	knifepoint	guts was good
2008-04-29T19:04:00.000Z	knifepoint	phaidros	guts was pretty stable for me too except i was holding off on upgrading the Ati drivers to AIGLX cause it was rubbish.... i wonder if i can revert back to old school drivers and xgl.
2008-04-29T19:05:00.000Z	phaidros	knifepoint	I'd not be sure about that ;)
2008-04-29T19:05:00.000Z	knifepoint	phaidros	im gonna take a guess and say it would be a headache ;P
2008-04-29T19:06:00.000Z	phaidros	knifepoint	maybe, plus a pain in the a**
2008-04-29T19:08:00.000Z	knifepoint	phaidros	no doubt... shame linux is so much better than windows otherwise id be using it for convenience
2008-04-29T19:08:00.000Z	phaidros	knifepoint	rofl!
2008-04-29T19:10:00.000Z	knifepoint	phaidros	thanks to you to man have a good one.
2008-04-29T19:11:00.000Z	phaidros	knifepoint	If I wouldn't believe in freedom, as in floss, I'd go for osX, lol
