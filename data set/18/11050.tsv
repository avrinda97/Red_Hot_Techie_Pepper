2006-09-23T12:13:00.000Z	blanky		I did sudo apt-get install openssh-server
2006-09-23T12:13:00.000Z	blanky		and then I keep trying sudo /etc/init.d/sshd restart and various other things but it won't work
2006-09-23T12:13:00.000Z	blanky		what must I do to commence the ssh daemon?
2006-09-23T12:15:00.000Z	blanky		when I tried to simply do sudo /etc/init.d/sshd start it said starting bsd ssh daemon ... [fail] 
2006-09-23T12:16:00.000Z	blanky		"
2006-09-23T12:16:00.000Z	blanky		no it's not this box, but yes it's online I went to google and all

2006-09-23T12:19:00.000Z	blanky		sudo: /etc/init.d/sshd: command not found
2006-09-23T12:19:00.000Z	ArrenLex	blanky	/etc/init.d/ssh force-reload
2006-11-27T09:09:00.000Z	ArrenLex	blanky	find "*.txt*
2006-11-27T09:09:00.000Z	blanky	ArrenLex	really? that easy?
2006-11-27T09:09:00.000Z	ArrenLex	blanky	provided your text files have a .txt extension.
2006-11-27T09:09:00.000Z	blanky	ArrenLex	yes they do
2006-11-27T09:09:00.000Z	ArrenLex	blanky	Just go to your folder and type in:   find -name ".txt"
2006-11-27T09:10:00.000Z	blanky	ArrenLex	and it'll look within every folder in that folder?
2006-11-27T09:10:00.000Z	ArrenLex	blanky	Just go to your folder and type in:   find -name "*.txt"
