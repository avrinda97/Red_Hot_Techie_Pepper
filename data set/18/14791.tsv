2005-06-12T06:07:00.000Z	CiRkiT		hello
2005-06-12T06:08:00.000Z	CiRkiT		for some reason when i try to edit my .fluxbox/menu file with an application i have here i save the file the way i modified it...but when i look in the menu it doesnt even show what i just modified
2005-06-12T06:08:00.000Z	CiRkiT		does ubuntu prohibit you from editing certain files? lol
2005-06-12T06:08:00.000Z	LinuxJones	CiRkiT	yeah :)
2005-06-12T06:09:00.000Z	CiRkiT	LinuxJones	it doesnt let you?
2005-06-12T06:09:00.000Z	CiRkiT		why is that...thats kinda dumb
2005-06-12T06:09:00.000Z	LinuxJones	CiRkiT	you can but you need to know the magic password
2005-06-12T06:09:00.000Z	CiRkiT	LinuxJones	?
2005-06-12T06:10:00.000Z	CiRkiT		sheesh
2005-06-12T06:10:00.000Z	CiRkiT		thats nuts lol
2005-06-12T06:10:00.000Z	LinuxJones	CiRkiT	you have to have root permissions to access system level stuff like services and config files and the like.
2005-06-12T06:10:00.000Z	CiRkiT	LinuxJones	but i do have root permissions when i do it
2005-06-12T06:11:00.000Z	LinuxJones	CiRkiT	open gnome-terminal and type sudo -s (enter your user password) and you should have a root terminal...be carefull of what you do in there it can take your system down very easily :)
2005-06-12T06:11:00.000Z	LinuxJones		sinope[crashed] , it basically is Debian
2005-06-12T06:12:00.000Z	CiRkiT		i was doing sudo -i LinuxJones ...i thought that was for root as well
2005-06-12T06:12:00.000Z	LinuxJones		sinope[crashed] , get working on that install :)
2005-06-12T06:13:00.000Z	CiRkiT		sudo -s still did me no good
2005-06-12T06:13:00.000Z	LinuxJones	CiRkiT	either is fine
