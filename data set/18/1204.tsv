2011-04-29T21:21:00.000Z	cablop		let me check mikebeecham
2011-04-29T21:22:00.000Z	cablop		why system settings in the shutdown menu????
2011-04-29T21:23:00.000Z	cablop		no checkbox, sorry, was confused
2011-04-29T21:24:00.000Z	cablop		afaik, if you use nvidia you will have a long way to go
2011-04-29T21:24:00.000Z	cablop		for 10.04 and 10.10 you need to delete nuveau drivers first, then install the nvidia ones
2011-04-29T21:26:00.000Z	cablop		because a broken reference in somepackage makes nouveau lanch and then you cannot use the nvidia drivers
2011-04-29T21:28:00.000Z	cablop		for everyone, i suggest you to install the classic gnome desktop, then tweak it until compiz and drivers are working properly
2011-04-29T21:29:00.000Z	cablop		then move to unity and make it works
2011-04-29T21:29:00.000Z	cablop		Nyvenza do that, move to classic gnome and deal with it until compiz works
2011-04-29T21:30:00.000Z	cablop		Nyvenza not all headers are installed by default
2011-04-29T21:30:00.000Z	NyvenZA	cablop	how do I change to the classic gnom?
2011-04-29T21:33:00.000Z	NyvenZA	cablop	I get  "e: unable to locate package gnome-desktop"
2011-04-29T21:42:00.000Z	NyvenZA	cablop	I don't have menus to click on, this doesn't really help
2011-04-29T21:43:00.000Z	cablop	NyvenZA	check the guide i gave you to get the old menus back
2011-04-29T21:43:00.000Z	NyvenZA	cablop	I tried it, I can't get the classic to display on login
2011-04-29T21:44:00.000Z	cablop	NyvenZA	it should be there, in the login called ubuntu classic
2011-04-29T21:45:00.000Z	NyvenZA	cablop	 the option is there. i select it, i login and then i get stuck
2011-04-29T21:47:00.000Z	cablop	NyvenZA	alternatively you can install compiz fusion icon to select default windows manager and so on
