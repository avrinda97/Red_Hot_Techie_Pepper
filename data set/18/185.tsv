2012-06-23T06:06:00.000Z	Whitney	i7c	Hey, it's Whitney from before.  I just shrunk my ntfs partition and it said there was about 83 gb unallocated.  I  haven't yet made the disk.
2012-06-23T06:07:00.000Z	i7c		hi Whitney. ok, 83 GB is not too much but enough for ubuntu i guess :)
2012-06-23T06:07:00.000Z	Whitney	i7c	 Would it be a smart idea to get rid of the Wubi install?
2012-06-23T06:09:00.000Z	i7c	Whitney	that totally depends on how much space you need. my ubuntu with some software installed only needs 8GB. if you wont have large files that have to be on the linux partition it's no problem
2012-06-23T06:10:00.000Z	Whitney	i7c	 Okay.  You just sounded unsure about the 83 gb I had free for Ubuntu.  So I should be fine with this amount, then?
2012-06-23T06:10:00.000Z	i7c	Whitney	it will work perfectly fine, yes.
2012-06-23T06:11:00.000Z	Whitney	i7c	 Okay, thank you.
2012-06-23T06:11:00.000Z	i7c	Whitney	i just checked. on my netbook i use ubuntu on a 60GB partition and i installed a lot of stuff still ;)
2012-06-23T06:13:00.000Z	Whitney	i7c	 Okay, sounds good!  I should be able to install music and all that, no problem, right?
2012-06-23T06:14:00.000Z	i7c	Whitney	yep. and you can also access your windows partitions or external harddrives.
2012-06-23T06:15:00.000Z	Whitney		Oh cool!  So no matter what I can make use of whatever space is on the computer from within Ubuntu.
2012-06-23T06:16:00.000Z	i7c	Whitney	if you do not use "strange" filesystems, yes. i think linux can't handle extNTFS or whatever it's called. but ntfs and FAT are no problem
2012-06-23T06:17:00.000Z	Whitney	i7c	 Excellent!  Thank you again for your help.
2012-06-23T06:18:00.000Z	i7c	Whitney	you're welcome. if you are online during installation i'm sure you'll find help here. but actually it isn't hard. with 80GB of space you can put everything on one partition.
2012-06-23T06:19:00.000Z	Whitney	i7c	 Alright.  I'm currently downloading the iso.  I'll stay connected and stop back in if I need any more help.
2012-06-23T06:27:00.000Z	i7c	Whitney	well i'm off, going to sleep. tomorrow i'll be back and can help you. or just ask here in the channel ;) night
2012-06-23T06:28:00.000Z	Whitney	i7c	 Thank you, see ya!
