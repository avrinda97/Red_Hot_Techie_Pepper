2010-01-19T01:39:00.000Z	isaac_		CAN ANYBODY READ ME yet?
2010-01-19T01:40:00.000Z	isaac_		okay, is there good site with xconf files with 1024x768 refresh rate?

2010-01-19T01:41:00.000Z	meganerd	isaac_	use xrandr, the xorg.conf is not really used
2010-01-19T01:41:00.000Z	isaac_	meganerd	thanks about time i find it
2010-01-19T01:43:00.000Z	isaac_	meganerd	where do you edit xrandr?
2010-01-19T01:44:00.000Z	meganerd	isaac_	xrandr is a command, there are gui front ends such as grandr
2010-01-19T01:44:00.000Z	meganerd	isaac_	the wiki is here: http://www.x.org/wiki/Projects/XRandR
2010-01-19T01:53:00.000Z	isaac_	meganerd	okay if you want to add mode 1024x768 at 120hz what would your command look like?
2010-01-19T01:53:00.000Z	meganerd	isaac_	I don't usually bother with the refresh values
2010-01-19T01:54:00.000Z	isaac_	meganerd	60hz looks like shit.. thats why, i need 120hz at 1024x768
2010-01-19T01:54:00.000Z	isaac_	meganerd	i don't want 85, 75, or less hz... I  wwant 120hz at 1024x768
2010-01-19T01:55:00.000Z	meganerd	isaac_	I think the command is --refresh <vlue> after the --output part
2010-01-19T01:56:00.000Z	meganerd	isaac_	all of my displays are LCD here, so there is no point in me setting the refresh rate
2010-01-19T01:56:00.000Z	meganerd	isaac_	in other words, I have nothing to test with
2010-01-19T01:56:00.000Z	isaac_	meganerd	i am trying to get my 3d thing to run at 120hz not 60hz
2010-01-19T01:56:00.000Z	isaac_	meganerd	the reason why i'm still on CRT
2010-01-19T01:57:00.000Z	isaac_	meganerd	and my crt still support up to 170hz
