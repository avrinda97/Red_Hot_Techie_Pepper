2009-03-11T13:08:00.000Z	sixofour		baz
2009-03-11T13:08:00.000Z	sixofour		all about the same issue
2009-03-11T13:09:00.000Z	sixofour		so how do i find these files?
2009-03-11T13:09:00.000Z	pyr3sayz	sixofour	do a file list on the archive
2009-03-11T13:12:00.000Z	pyr3sayz	sixofour	run this `unrar l /ment/ext3/file.rar | less`
2009-03-11T13:21:00.000Z	pyr3sayz	sixofour	are you on a live cd?
2009-03-11T13:28:00.000Z	pyr3sayz	sixofour	You said that they were all in the /home/ directory, right?
2009-03-11T13:32:00.000Z	pyr3sayz	sixofour	with the 'mount' command, though if you are talking about making your entire filesystem writeable without sudo... that's not a good idea
2009-03-11T13:40:00.000Z	pyr3sayz	sixofour	you need the '\' before $FILE
2009-03-11T13:46:00.000Z	pyr3sayz	sixofour	sounds like there may be some problems due to the Os drive filling up...
2009-03-11T13:55:00.000Z	pyr3sayz	sixofour	so you're still getting the 'cannot access parent directories' error?
