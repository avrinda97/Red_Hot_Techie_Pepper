2007-10-31T11:38:00.000Z	tag-		what's the difference between "GL Desktop" and "Advanced Desktop Settings Manager"
2007-10-31T11:38:00.000Z	tag-		I seem to have two things competing for the keys cltr+alt+left
2007-10-31T11:39:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	tag-	no idea what GL desktop is
2007-10-31T11:40:00.000Z	tag-	MilitantPotato	it seems to be a nicer, more apple-like interface to the same stuff
2007-10-31T11:41:00.000Z	tag-	MilitantPotato	but when I hit ctrl+alt+left, I move two workspaces (but my virtual cube thingy only rotates once)
2007-10-31T11:41:00.000Z	tag-	MilitantPotato	and it doesn't always do it.  Sometimes it moves one, sometimes it moves two, and it doesn't always move back...it seems completely wacky
2007-10-31T11:42:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	tag-	 compiz-config-settings manager is the thing ya want :)
2007-10-31T11:42:00.000Z	tag-	MilitantPotato	right, but like I said, it's not really working quite right.
2007-10-31T11:43:00.000Z	tag-	MilitantPotato	I think it's gnome-compiz-manager... :-)
2007-10-31T11:44:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	tag-	gnome is a simpler version.
2007-10-31T11:44:00.000Z	tag-	MilitantPotato	that's the GL Desktop one, I mean
2007-10-31T11:44:00.000Z	tag-	MilitantPotato	right
2007-10-31T11:45:00.000Z	tag-	MilitantPotato	yes, removed the gnome one
2007-10-31T11:47:00.000Z	tag-	MilitantPotato	I'm on workspace one.  If I hit ctrl+alt+right, I go to workspace 3.  If I hit it again, I go to workspace one again.  The cube only turns 1/4th a turn
2007-10-31T11:47:00.000Z	tag-	MilitantPotato	what the heck is going on :-(
2007-10-31T11:49:00.000Z	tag-	MilitantPotato	if I do it while dragging a window (ctrl+alt+shift+left) I can move two workspaces from one before coming back to it.  It goes from one, to four (which is right), then from four to two, then from two back to one.  And if I keep doing it, it will stop coming back to one and just toggle between four and two.
2007-10-31T11:50:00.000Z	tag-	MilitantPotato	that works fine
2007-10-31T11:50:00.000Z	tag-	MilitantPotato	and ctrl+alt+left no longer changes workspaces
