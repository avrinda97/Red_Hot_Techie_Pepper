2012-10-16T20:29:00.000Z	michealPW	llutz	hehe, I don't think you can read that README if you can't do sudo (Unless you use a liveCD?)
2012-10-16T20:29:00.000Z	llutz	michealPW	true
2012-10-16T20:32:00.000Z	llutz	michealPW	they haven't got changed, this will always happen if you create a new file in that directory while having a umask of 0022
2012-10-16T20:32:00.000Z	michealPW	llutz	It can be frustrating.. Since Ubuntu doesn't have a root account setup by default so if sudo gets broken hehe you don't have many options to troubleshoot unless you kinda already know what you're doing hehe
2012-10-16T20:32:00.000Z	michealPW	llutz	Ahh, I see! So that's what Ikano was talking about, then? :)
2012-10-16T20:33:00.000Z	llutz	michealPW	and this makes the usage of /etc/sudoers.d/ very dangerous
2012-10-16T20:33:00.000Z	llutz	michealPW	idk honestly
2012-10-17T17:29:00.000Z	llutz	michealPW	if you dont need them, why did you install them
2012-10-17T17:30:00.000Z	michealPW	llutz	I was browsing Ubuntu Software Center for education programs/games for my kids. I'm guessing KDE tagged along with one of those educational packages? :\
2012-10-17T17:47:00.000Z	llutz	michealPW	"mv ~/.kde ~/.kde-bak "  would have solved the most problems i guess
2012-10-17T17:48:00.000Z	michealPW	llutz	Not really, no. Already done that 4 times...
2012-10-17T17:48:00.000Z	michealPW	llutz	You're right though, it temporarily fixes EVERYTHING... But then within' a day it's all back to broken again.
2012-10-17T17:49:00.000Z	michealPW	llutz	That's why I wanted to purge KDE entirely, all configs and start from the fresh 4.9 with it's default config. Iunno, just hoping for the best at this point :\
2012-10-17T17:49:00.000Z	llutz	michealPW	i'm using kde since 0.7 (not ubuntu), i never had that much trouble with it
2012-10-17T17:50:00.000Z	llutz	michealPW	from what i read: i guess you'll break it in 2-4 days too :)
2012-10-17T17:50:00.000Z	michealPW	llutz	Iunno, probably user-error. The only thing that really changes everysingle time after I rename .kde and start with a new one is a Language pop-up, saying my Languages aren't installed properly and it downloads a whole bunch of internationalization packages... Maybe they're breaking things? I have no idea :\
2012-10-17T17:50:00.000Z	michealPW	llutz	If that's the case (Hope not LOL!) I'll have no choice but to stay with Unity and GNOME 3, unfortunately. I really like KDE, though :(
2012-10-17T17:53:00.000Z	michealPW	llutz	My main problem with KDE is like I said.. I'll rename my .kde and I'll log-in, everything seems fine.. I log-out. I log-in again and then I can't log-out, shutdown or restart KDE. The buttons do nothing.
