2012-03-17T23:02:00.000Z	Ebron		Which backup solutions would you recommend for ubuntu?
2012-03-17T23:04:00.000Z	Ebron		I can live with installing ubuntu again, but then I would like to type restore and voila, apache is again installed, my apt-repos are back to normal, logcheck is configured - you get my drift
2012-03-17T23:05:00.000Z	wylde	Ebron	ever looked at squashfs? Excellent compression if compiled with XZ support
2012-03-17T23:05:00.000Z	Ebron	wylde	for a clone?
2012-03-17T23:06:00.000Z	wylde	Ebron	it compresses the entire filesystem, either to a file or compressed block device
2012-03-17T23:07:00.000Z	wylde	Ebron	it's used widely on live cd's and embedded devices
2012-03-17T23:08:00.000Z	Ebron	wylde	nice, so if I get this correctly I would mount a backupdrive with squashfs and just clone the entire shebang like virtual machines do?
2012-03-17T23:09:00.000Z	wylde	Ebron	essentially yes, but the package from sources only has gzip support compiled in, you' need to download the source and libs to compile in XZ compression.
2012-03-17T23:09:00.000Z	wylde	Ebron	it makes an exact compressed duplicate of the filesystem
2012-03-17T23:10:00.000Z	wylde	Ebron	I keep all my photo's and doc templates in a .squashfs file, it can also be mounted as a loop device that way
2012-03-17T23:10:00.000Z	wylde	Ebron	 read-only though
2012-03-17T23:11:00.000Z	Ebron	wylde	How do you go about restoring the installation if it gets bricked?
2012-03-17T23:11:00.000Z	Ebron	wylde	just uncompress it on / ?
2012-03-17T23:11:00.000Z	wylde	Ebron	I 'believe' you could boot a live cd and uncompress the filesystem to it
2012-03-17T23:12:00.000Z	Ebron	wylde	That
2012-03-17T23:12:00.000Z	wylde	Ebron	I can't say from experience, but I would think so. Do a bit of research on it though.
2012-03-17T23:12:00.000Z	Ebron	wylde	That's actually not a bad idea
2012-03-17T23:16:00.000Z	wylde	Ebron	squashfs gets incredible compression on filesystems, but like all compression methods data that's already binary or compressed, (compiled programs, images, mp3) don't gain much from the compression.
