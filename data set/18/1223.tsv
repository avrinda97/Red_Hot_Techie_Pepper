2012-04-10T23:17:00.000Z	halakar		should i get adobe reader on my rig, or is there something else i can use?
2012-04-10T23:18:00.000Z	escott	halakar	evince?
2012-04-10T23:20:00.000Z	escott	halakar	if you are using kubuntu you should just use the default applications provided with kde. so you probably dont want to use evince as that is gnome/unity
2012-04-10T23:20:00.000Z	halakar	escott	nono, i am using ubuntu

2012-06-02T04:03:00.000Z	halakar	escott	I think I need this:  http://sourceforge.net/projects/boot-repair-cd/files/
2012-06-02T04:04:00.000Z	escott	halakar	i think you should read the documentation and follow the step by step instructions we linked you to. but feel free to ignore us
2012-06-02T04:04:00.000Z	halakar	escott	I'm not ignoring you.  Your instructions say use boot-repair.  The link I found is of 5-30.  Problem?
2012-06-02T04:06:00.000Z	escott	halakar	"of 5-30"??
2012-06-02T04:06:00.000Z	halakar	escott	yes.
2012-06-02T04:06:00.000Z	escott	halakar	what does that mean
2012-06-02T04:07:00.000Z	escott	halakar	if you want to do it the graphical way then "insert your ubuntu cd" reboot and choose "try ubuntu"
2012-06-02T04:08:00.000Z	escott	halakar	unless you want to make the disk, but if you have an ubuntu disk that seems like more effort than it is worth. so go to 2 and run the two commands "sudo add-apt-repository ..." and "sudo apt-get install ..."
2012-06-02T04:08:00.000Z	halakar	escott	I am downloading the boot-repair iso now and will not be using the ubuntu disc.
2012-06-02T04:18:00.000Z	halakar	escott	those directions you posted are garbage anyway.  there's nothing in a live environment even called boot-repair.  you can't even find it in the package manager.  absolute garbage.
2012-06-02T04:19:00.000Z	escott	halakar	you have to run the add-apt-repo command first
2012-06-02T04:20:00.000Z	escott	halakar	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Boot-Repair "2nd option : install Boot-Repair in Ubuntu"
2012-06-02T04:22:00.000Z	escott	halakar	it gives you 4 different methods you can use to reinstall grub. you are welcome to use whichever one you want
