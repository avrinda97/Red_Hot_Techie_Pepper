2007-02-04T09:26:00.000Z	CyberCod		I'd like to try to get my Handspring Treo 300 working with ubuntu, anyone have any tips? it just freezes whenever I try to sync it via usb cable
2007-02-04T09:28:00.000Z	soundray	CyberCod	I had the same problem with edgy, but got it to work with dapper (Palm TX)
2007-02-04T09:38:00.000Z	CyberCod	soundray	 I'm in dapper now, and i believe there are subtle differences between handspring and palm that just won't let it work right
2007-02-04T09:39:00.000Z	soundray	CyberCod	btw, I had fewer troubles with wireless network hotsync than with the USB/cradle connection
2007-02-04T09:40:00.000Z	CyberCod	soundray	 how does that work?  you mean via infrared?
2007-02-04T09:40:00.000Z	soundray	CyberCod	no, by wireless I mean WLAN according to IEEE 802.11b
2007-02-04T09:43:00.000Z	CyberCod	soundray	 i cannot connect my treo to wlan... just phone networks (disabled) and usb.  No slots either
2007-02-04T09:43:00.000Z	soundray	CyberCod	what stage does it get to before it crashes?
2007-02-04T09:43:00.000Z	CyberCod	soundray	 but I do have an infrared usb adapter... you may have helped me more than you know
2007-02-04T09:44:00.000Z	CyberCod	soundray	 right at the start of the sync
2007-02-04T09:44:00.000Z	soundray	CyberCod	well, IR can be a can of worms, too...
2007-02-04T09:44:00.000Z	CyberCod	soundray	 ends up needing a hard reset via the pinhole in the back
2007-02-04T09:44:00.000Z	soundray	CyberCod	oh, it's the Treo crashing, not ubuntu?
2007-02-04T09:45:00.000Z	CyberCod	soundray	 yes, the treo is crashing
2007-02-09T14:30:00.000Z	soundray	CyberCod	can you please read and follow up the information that ubotu sent you, and only ask if something is left unclear on these pages.
2007-02-09T14:42:00.000Z	soundray	CyberCod	check out 'man chown', it'll tell you that it's user:group (ubuntu has a group for each user by default)
2007-09-24T06:35:00.000Z	soundray	CyberCod	no
2007-09-24T06:35:00.000Z	soundray	CyberCod	yes. You'll have fewer problems with 32bits even.
