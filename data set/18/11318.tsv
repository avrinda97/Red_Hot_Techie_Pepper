2006-10-07T15:58:00.000Z	kyja	Godfather	ummm, why cant you network?
2006-10-07T16:02:00.000Z	kyja	Godfather	I just read something this morning. someone got there wireless working by creating a one line file. I will look
2006-10-07T16:04:00.000Z	kyja	Godfather	/etc/default/wpasupplicant    line= ENABLED=1
2006-10-07T16:05:00.000Z	kyja	Godfather	wont hurt to try this. can deleate if it still does not work with wep
2006-10-07T16:07:00.000Z	kyja	Godfather	people have had good results enableing wpa with that
2006-10-07T16:08:00.000Z	kyja	Godfather	if it is not autenticating wpa what I just told you will probly get you going. you dont have to connect it hardwire first.
2006-10-07T16:09:00.000Z	kyja	Godfather	if you do sudo gedit /etc/default/wpasupplicant and add ENABLED=1 your wep will autenticate perhaps
2006-10-07T16:11:00.000Z	kyja	Godfather	your welcome and hope it works
