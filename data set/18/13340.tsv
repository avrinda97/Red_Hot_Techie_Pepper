2005-12-04T13:16:00.000Z	indra_jack	cdubya	i have sharing printer in win 98 but i cannot see in network for printer...but when i share a folder in win 98 i can see it

2005-12-04T13:18:00.000Z	cdubya	indra_jack	do you know the IP of the 98 box?
2005-12-04T13:19:00.000Z	cdubya	indra_jack	and you've setup the correct ip, user and passwd in the warty printer config, using SMB?
2005-12-04T13:19:00.000Z	cdubya	indra_jack	can you connect to a file share on the 98 box?
2005-12-04T13:20:00.000Z	cdubya	indra_jack	do you have the shared printer name right?
2005-12-04T13:22:00.000Z	cdubya	indra_jack	the reason I ask is that you're not going to "see" the printer in a network unless you're using the KDE print manager and try to set it up as a Samba printer there, and even if there, if memory serves, you just give the URI.....
2005-12-04T13:24:00.000Z	cdubya	indra_jack	does warty have a default driver for the c63?
2005-12-04T13:25:00.000Z	cdubya	indra_jack	you might consider running breezy if you want it supported.....I know for a fact that it is on breezy because I'm running it and I just checked it out in the printing config.....
2005-12-04T13:28:00.000Z	cdubya	indra_jack	should be just fine.....
