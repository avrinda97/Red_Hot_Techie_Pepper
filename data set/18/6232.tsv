2008-06-19T19:22:00.000Z	cb__		Hello i have have been trying to trouble shoot my sound issues for a few days if anyone could tell me which screen shots to post and which config files to put in pastebin in order to get the correct help i would love you.
2008-06-19T19:23:00.000Z	ASULutzy	cb__	I'm not really a sound guru, but what problems are you having specifically with sound?
2008-06-19T19:24:00.000Z	cb__	ASULutzy	system sound works perfect but mp3's and avi's and youtube dont work
2008-06-19T19:24:00.000Z	ASULutzy	cb__	Are you sure it's not an application issue?
2008-06-19T19:24:00.000Z	cb__	ASULutzy	vlc and audioluous
2008-06-19T19:24:00.000Z	ASULutzy	cb__	If you're system sounds are working but media specifically isn't working, I'd bet it's the application not sending stuff to the right places
2008-06-19T19:24:00.000Z	ASULutzy	cb__	your* that is
2008-06-19T19:25:00.000Z	ASULutzy	cb__	Are you sure you've configured everything correctly in system->preferences ->sound ?
2008-06-19T19:25:00.000Z	cb__	ASULutzy	i have changed it 100 times, thats why i wanna post screen shots cause i feel i am going in circles / breaking it more
2008-06-19T19:27:00.000Z	cb__	ASULutzy	i am gonna go have a smoke then i will post some setting, also which is a sure fire app to try out?
2008-06-19T19:28:00.000Z	ASULutzy	cb__	There are really no best applications. My personal preference? I use amarok for music and usually vlc for video. The no sound in youtube video is probably separate from the no sound in movies/mp3's.
2008-06-19T19:29:00.000Z	ASULutzy	cb__	I'd be almost 100% sure someone here could be way more helpful than I am with this, but since you do in fact have sound working, it shouldn't be all that bad to fix up sound in your media. I'd bet it's either an incorrect setting in a specific application, or maybe it's because you didn't download the codecs you needed?
2008-06-19T19:29:00.000Z	cb__	ASULutzy	i installed that flashplugin-nonfree thing could that be screwing stuff up? sorry to be noobish grew up using windows as my desktop
2008-06-19T19:30:00.000Z	ASULutzy	cb__	Yea, I think the flashplugin-nonfree is necessary to play youtube videos... Let's worry about youtube after we worry about .avi/.mp3 (because I have more experience with those :) )
2008-06-19T19:30:00.000Z	cb__	ASULutzy	k brb in 5 thanks
2008-06-19T19:30:00.000Z	ASULutzy	cb__	If you open a .avi or a .mp3 with Ubuntu's built in media player, it should go offer to download the correct codec
2008-06-19T19:30:00.000Z	ASULutzy	cb__	Did you do that yet?
2008-06-19T19:59:00.000Z	cb__	ASULutzy	: back where should we start
