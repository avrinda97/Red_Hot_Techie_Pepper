2005-02-15T10:32:00.000Z	goldfish		I was wondering how to set up my sound? I am completely new to linux.
2005-02-15T10:33:00.000Z	souki	goldfish	do you have the ubuntu sound at startup (gnome) ?
2005-02-15T10:33:00.000Z	goldfish	souki	nope
2005-02-15T10:33:00.000Z	souki	goldfish	try Menu/Multimedia/Volume-Control
2005-02-15T10:34:00.000Z	goldfish	souki	No mixer elements and/or devices found.
2005-02-15T10:34:00.000Z	souki	goldfish	ouch! your sound card wasn't detected
2005-02-15T10:35:00.000Z	goldfish	souki	ah jeez :/
2005-02-15T10:35:00.000Z	souki	goldfish	do you know which sound card is on your system ?
2005-02-15T10:39:00.000Z	souki	goldfish	you can put the new option in "nonaltoptions=.." so you can keep it when upgrading the kernel
2005-02-15T10:39:00.000Z	souki	goldfish	and then: update-grub
2005-02-15T10:41:00.000Z	goldfish	souki	Do I put it in both places so?
2005-02-15T10:42:00.000Z	souki	goldfish	no need, you have to type "sudo update-grub"
2005-02-15T10:42:00.000Z	souki	goldfish	it is a magic line
