2008-05-14T01:25:00.000Z	anabolix		can anyone help me with removing a program? i just want to make sure im doing the right thing
2008-05-14T01:25:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	anabolix	which program?
2008-05-14T01:27:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	anabolix	 sudo apt-get purge yourprogram
2008-05-14T01:28:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	anabolix	did you get the program from the network yes?
2008-05-14T01:28:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	anabolix	if you purge the program it will get rid of some config file stuff as well that you don't want anymore
2008-05-14T01:29:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	anabolix	also if there is anything to do with the program after removing as a hidden .folder in the home folder remove that as well
2008-05-14T01:29:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	anabolix	 well if you don't purge there may be some files left behind that were to do with that program,  that you may as well also have deleted
2008-05-14T01:31:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	anabolix	quite a lot of programs will leave user data in the home folder as a hidden folder
2008-05-14T01:31:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	anabolix	 it's best to always purge the program and then view hidden files and folders of the home folder and look for any . folder that has anything to do with it and delete that as well if there is one
2008-05-14T01:32:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	anabolix	well that's for  ordindary programs like the one you mentioend and stuff like Firefox
2008-05-14T01:34:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	anabolix	delete the hidden files from the home directory to do with it and then try and open the program again
2008-05-14T01:36:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	anabolix	not for tranmission no
2008-05-14T01:36:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	anabolix	what torrents program you using now then?
2008-05-14T01:39:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	anabolix	delete the transmission stuff from home and try and opne the program again to see if it will open or not
2008-05-14T01:39:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	anabolix	and synaptec package manager says it isan't even installed?
2008-05-14T01:41:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	anabolix	you can manually find out where the transmission files are and delete them with root/sudo or whatever, but that will be a right pain.  also  the Gnome menu can be edited, but it's not as easy as say editing the Windows start menu
2008-05-14T01:41:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	anabolix	if it says it's not installed you could try to just install it and then purge remove it
2008-05-14T01:41:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	anabolix	and make sure the transmission stuff is gone from home
