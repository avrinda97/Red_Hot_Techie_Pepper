2008-06-04T14:10:00.000Z	nucco	drash	I did, no change. apparently, dri is no longer available according to glxinfo
2008-06-04T14:11:00.000Z	drash	nucco	sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf and add it again, might be helpfull of you could pastebin your xorg.conf so we can take a closer look
2008-06-04T14:12:00.000Z	nucco	drash	will paste my xorg.conf in a minute. no change whatsoever was made to the file until after the problem started, and I was attempting to fix it. even so, I only used dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2008-06-04T14:13:00.000Z	drash	nucco	okay .. no rush
2008-06-04T14:13:00.000Z	nucco	drash	here's my xorg.conf http://paste.ubuntu.com/16817/
2008-06-04T14:14:00.000Z	drash	nucco	i'll take a look and report back, give me a minute ..
2008-06-04T14:14:00.000Z	nucco	drash	everything else is working, correct res, movie playback. except no dri, and thus, no compiz
2008-06-04T14:15:00.000Z	drash	nucco	you might have mentioned your card type, nut i missed that, which one is it exactly ?
2008-06-04T14:15:00.000Z	nucco	drash	intel GMA 965
2008-06-04T14:16:00.000Z	drash	nucco	k thanks, looking at your xorg.conf ..
2008-06-04T14:22:00.000Z	drash	nucco	i replied at your pastebin with things you might already know ... There's al link attached for more info on how to enable DRI, gdluck
2008-06-04T14:23:00.000Z	nucco	drash	will check. thanks.
2008-06-04T14:24:00.000Z	nucco	drash	doesn't seem to be anything new when I refresh http://paste.ubuntu.com/16817/
2008-06-04T14:24:00.000Z	drash	nucco	sorry, it's at http://paste.ubuntu.com/16820/
2008-06-04T14:31:00.000Z	nucco	drash	I added the modules entry and the dri bit too... I just gotta wait till I can safely restart X. if it works, then I can only say its odd that it worked in the past without those entries.
2008-06-04T14:32:00.000Z	drash	nucco	it should, the new Xorg in 8.04 has improved a lot in that sense, i just don't know intel cards well enough to judge
2008-06-04T15:29:00.000Z	nucco	drash	can you believe it, removing nvidia-glx plus config files fixes the problem... you think this is a bug worth filing?
2008-06-04T15:30:00.000Z	drash	nucco	actually i do yes, nice that you found that one
