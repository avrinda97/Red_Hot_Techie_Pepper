2008-11-05T02:01:00.000Z	noobuntux		$i'm in trouble about my wifi card
2008-11-05T02:03:00.000Z	noobuntux		my wifi card is recognized natively ( Intel Corporation PRO/Wireless 2915ABG ), lsmod | grep ipw is here. But i don'"t see my wifi device. Guess it's because the device isn't power on, but when i click on fn + "sort of logo looking like a wifi radar" nothing happen
2008-11-05T02:03:00.000Z	noobuntux		how can i power on my device manually ?
2008-11-05T02:03:00.000Z	ay^	noobuntux	does dmesg give you anything when you switch it?
2008-11-05T02:04:00.000Z	noobuntux	ay^	no
2008-11-05T02:04:00.000Z	ay^	noobuntux	google for you computer model and wifi switch might be some problems with it
2008-11-05T02:05:00.000Z	noobuntux	ay^	it's a dell latitude D410
2008-11-05T02:06:00.000Z	ay^	noobuntux	I know nothgin about that, sorry, but try google for it, my dell had some errors with the led for wifi, but not the switch itself
2008-11-05T02:06:00.000Z	noobuntux	ay^	if it was just a led problem, i guess my device would be here ifconfig
2008-11-05T02:07:00.000Z	ay^	noobuntux	exactly, so I can√§t help you more
2008-11-05T02:07:00.000Z	noobuntux	ay^	ok
2008-11-05T02:12:00.000Z	noobuntux	ay^	i was wrong

2008-11-05T02:13:00.000Z	noobuntux	ay^	http://pastebin.com/m41d5bc5b
2008-11-05T02:13:00.000Z	noobuntux		my card is unclaimed
2008-11-05T02:13:00.000Z	noobuntux		seems to be a firmware problem
2008-11-05T02:13:00.000Z	ay^	noobuntux	that sucks :/
