2007-12-08T05:53:00.000Z	ztomic	enigmata	are you  going to install alsa from source?
2007-12-08T05:54:00.000Z	ztomic	enigmata	yeah but you have to install alsa from source to patch.
2007-12-08T05:56:00.000Z	ztomic	enigmata	Im no expert so I can't walk you through it but: Download or install alsa source, apply the patch with #patch -p0 < patch-file-name-here. compile and install.
2007-12-08T06:06:00.000Z	ztomic	enigmata	step 1: #apt-get alsa-source
2007-12-08T06:08:00.000Z	ztomic	enigmata	open synaptics and enable the source option.

2007-12-08T06:14:00.000Z	ztomic	enigmata	"source code" change the minus to a check.
2007-12-08T06:16:00.000Z	ztomic	enigmata	download the source... gimme a few minutes to work through this patch.
2007-12-08T06:20:00.000Z	ztomic	enigmata	do you want this to be a deb package when finished?
2007-12-08T06:24:00.000Z	ztomic	enigmata	after selecting the source code option, restart synaptics. then search  for "alsa-source".
2007-12-08T06:27:00.000Z	ztomic	enigmata	#cat /usr/share/doc/alsa-source/README.Debian | less
2007-12-08T06:29:00.000Z	ztomic	enigmata	I suggest creating a directory in your home folder and extracting the contents there instead of compiling in the /usr/src directory.
2007-12-08T06:32:00.000Z	ztomic	enigmata	rtfm. cd to your directory and not /usr/src
2007-12-08T06:32:00.000Z	ztomic	enigmata	this is gonna take a while
2007-12-08T06:34:00.000Z	ztomic	enigmata	hehe
