2008-07-31T01:55:00.000Z	ejer	blackpearl	/usr/local/bin is a good place for scripts
2008-07-31T01:56:00.000Z	ejer	blackpearl	must chmod +x as well
2008-07-31T01:57:00.000Z	blackpearl	ejer	yes.... chmod i already done
2008-07-31T01:57:00.000Z	ejer	blackpearl	AND it has to be in a directory in your path, so /usr/local/bin
2008-07-31T02:01:00.000Z	blackpearl	ejer	no.... it's not in /usr/local/bin, i have to type xterm99 in alt-f2 for it to work, when i rename it as just xterm, it will not work
2008-07-31T02:02:00.000Z	ejer	blackpearl	there is already a program called xterm...
2008-07-31T02:02:00.000Z	blackpearl	ejer	i ve done it before in older ubuntu version, it simply overwrites existing xterm command
2008-07-31T02:02:00.000Z	blackpearl	ejer	it's in /usr/local/bin, not in /bin
2008-07-31T02:03:00.000Z	ejer	blackpearl	not sure what the issue is, why don't you just give it a unique name?
2008-07-31T02:03:00.000Z	blackpearl	ejer	i am just too-use to typing xterm inside alt-f2 command box
2008-07-31T02:05:00.000Z	ejer	blackpearl	this belongs in a bash alias, not a script imo
2008-07-31T02:06:00.000Z	blackpearl	ejer	yes, i have that inside .bashrc, but i took it one steap further. it was working before before i upgrade
2008-07-31T02:06:00.000Z	ejer	blackpearl	what is your one step further? cause then .bashrc will be overriding whatever else is named the same
2008-07-31T02:07:00.000Z	blackpearl	ejer	putting an alias inside .bashrc will nt have effect inside alt-f2 box
2008-07-31T02:13:00.000Z	ejer	blackpearl	you could try putting the entire alias in .gnomerc
2008-07-31T02:13:00.000Z	blackpearl	ejer	ok, let me check it out
