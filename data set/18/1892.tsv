2011-01-13T09:28:00.000Z	SeaPhor	KM0201	takes all kinds to make the world turn,,, but we can make them stronger, better, we have the tech....
2011-01-13T09:28:00.000Z	KM0201	SeaPhor	he can't listen for nothing, i was even nice and PM'd him, and he can't follow a simple direction, so i gave up
2011-01-13T09:31:00.000Z	KM0201	SeaPhor	you've been warned, my pet rock listens better than he does
2011-01-13T09:32:00.000Z	SeaPhor	KM0201	i think my pet rock and yours need to hook up,,, maybe they can do it ;)
2011-01-13T09:47:00.000Z	SeaPhor	KM0201	i remember in around 7.04 days when i even mentioned "envy" the ops would threaten to kick/ban me.. then in the next release it was in the repos???
2011-01-13T09:47:00.000Z	KM0201	SeaPhor	yup!...lol
2011-01-13T09:47:00.000Z	KM0201	SeaPhor	the funny thing was, even after they put it in the repos, you'd get kicked if you recommended it
2011-01-13T10:57:00.000Z	KM0201	SeaPhor	well, true...
