2006-08-06T07:09:00.000Z	nocarrier	sethk	umm... just out of curiosity, how do you change the partition number "on the fly"?
2006-08-06T07:09:00.000Z	sethk	nocarrier	you can't.  hda is master, hdb is slave, and 1, 2, 3, and 4 are the four partitions.
2006-08-06T07:10:00.000Z	sethk	nocarrier	so if the driver is primary master it is hda#, and if it is primary slave it is hdb#, and secondary master hdc#, secondary slave hdd#
2006-08-06T07:10:00.000Z	nocarrier	sethk	I know.... what is why I was asking what you meant by:  "linux doesn't care, so you can make the hda1 disk hda2, the disk from the old box"
2006-08-06T07:11:00.000Z	sethk	nocarrier	I meant that he can connect up the drive that is currently primary master as primary slave, and he'll still be able to boot the ubuntu partition, although now it will be hdb instead of hda.  you would have to modify /etc/fstab to compensate, and possibly /boot/grub/menu.lst.
2006-08-06T07:11:00.000Z	sethk	nocarrier	the idea being to get around the fact that xp often refuses to boot unless it is the first partition on primary master
2006-08-06T07:12:00.000Z	nocarrier	sethk	Don't need to explain ;)  been doin this for quite a while ;)....i just didn't understand what you meant
2006-08-06T07:12:00.000Z	sethk	nocarrier	ok, even if you already know, probably there are other people listening who don't.
2006-08-06T07:23:00.000Z	nocarrier	sethk	bzip2 = /bin
2006-08-06T07:23:00.000Z	sethk	nocarrier	not on my ubuntu boxes.
2006-08-06T07:24:00.000Z	nocarrier	sethk	yours is messed up then ;)
2006-08-06T07:24:00.000Z	sethk	nocarrier	checked two 5.1 boxes, both have bzip2 in /usr/bin
2006-08-06T07:24:00.000Z	sethk	nocarrier	more logical that they are in the same directory, so I can see why they would have moved one
2006-08-06T07:25:00.000Z	sethk	nocarrier	I do some
2006-08-06T07:29:00.000Z	nocarrier	sethk	as a NPU, you really can't harm anything anyway
2006-08-06T07:30:00.000Z	sethk	nocarrier	probably true, but I haven't personally tested it.  Since there is no good reason to run it, even a tiny risk is an unnecessary risk.
2006-08-06T07:31:00.000Z	nocarrier	sethk	no, but outlook could be useful for people who use exchange
2006-08-06T07:31:00.000Z	sethk	nocarrier	true.
