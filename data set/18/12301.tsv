2006-05-11T09:43:00.000Z	ompaul	marcie	its a mess but that is how it is done
2006-05-11T09:48:00.000Z	ompaul	marcie	please leave the bad language at the door, we want a "g rated" channel :-) thanks

2006-05-11T09:52:00.000Z	ompaul	marcie	put it all on one line - makes it easy to understand what you are trying to do, don't break it up into little bits (bytes ;))
2006-05-11T09:55:00.000Z	ompaul	marcie	now if I had a player I would know how to do it :)P
2006-05-11T10:10:00.000Z	ompaul	marcie	try #ubuntu-offtopic they might entertain you
2006-05-20T15:14:00.000Z	ompaul	marcie	what printer is it?
2006-05-20T15:14:00.000Z	marcie	ompaul	Hi again...its a Lexmark Oprata E310 black and white laser printer
2006-05-20T15:14:00.000Z	marcie	ompaul	Optra...
2006-05-20T15:19:00.000Z	ompaul	marcie	do this, from the menu, System Administration Printing, then it should be easy enough to say local printer and work from there
2006-05-20T15:20:00.000Z	marcie	ompaul	It gives me the choice of at least ten drivers...none of them related to my printer (where i ran into trouble before). Should i just pick at random and see what works?
2006-05-20T15:21:00.000Z	ompaul	marcie	I see it there are a lot of them, you are running 5.10 I take it
2006-05-20T15:24:00.000Z	ompaul	marcie	your printer is there it just needs to be scrolled down to it, its a long way off
2006-05-20T15:25:00.000Z	marcie	ompaul	Ah ok I didn't see one of the menus...
2006-05-21T16:09:00.000Z	ompaul	marcie	check out the command tar
2006-05-21T16:09:00.000Z	marcie	ompaul	in the wiki?
2006-05-21T16:11:00.000Z	ompaul	marcie	on the command line more so, >>man tar<< or get a "tape faq" if there is one on the wiki (don't know or out of mr google) the tar command stands for tape archive
