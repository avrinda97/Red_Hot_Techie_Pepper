2010-03-18T06:06:00.000Z	mark__		what log files should i watch to diagnose network erros
2010-03-18T06:07:00.000Z	mark__		i know its tail something
2010-03-18T06:07:00.000Z	mark__		the command
2010-03-18T06:08:00.000Z	mark__		no theres a log that you can view that tells you what your adapter is doing
2010-03-18T06:08:00.000Z	mark__		like so you can see whats going on
2010-03-18T06:09:00.000Z	mark__		anyone know?
2010-03-18T06:09:00.000Z	marginoferror	mark__	do you mean dmesg?  Just type dmesg at the command line and see if that gives you any useful info
2010-03-18T06:09:00.000Z	marginoferror		It's chronological with the most recent at the bottom.  If your network card is behaving badly the driver will likely report to dmesg
2010-03-18T06:10:00.000Z	marginoferror		Of course, if your network card thinks it's working correctly, it may say nothing of import.  So ymmv.
2010-03-18T06:10:00.000Z	mark__		no you have it run awhile your trying to connect
2010-03-18T06:10:00.000Z	marginoferror	mark__	Not sure then, sorry.
2010-03-18T06:11:00.000Z	mark__		does anyone know
2010-03-18T06:11:00.000Z	mark__		yes
2010-03-18T06:11:00.000Z	mark__		i know you use tail
2010-03-18T06:11:00.000Z	mark__		i just can't remember the rest of the command
2010-03-18T06:12:00.000Z	mark__	matu	whats up?
2010-03-18T06:12:00.000Z	marginoferror	mark__	first, you don't need to be running tail while you're trying to connect.  Tail monitors a file for additional lines, so if you're using tail the thing you're monitoring is being written to a file anyway
2010-03-18T06:12:00.000Z	marginoferror	mark__	The relevant files should all be in /var/logs, but I really think dmesg is the only one that will help you
