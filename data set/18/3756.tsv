2009-08-05T03:42:00.000Z	Sahdos	georgefrs	 model number...hmmm...don't think I've ever come across it
2009-08-05T03:38:00.000Z	Sahdos	georgefrs	 without a 64bit cpu will it be faster?
2009-08-05T03:39:00.000Z	georgefrs	Sahdos	without a 64-bit cpu?
2009-08-05T03:40:00.000Z	Sahdos	georgefrs	 will encoding video etc. be faster without a 64bit cpu?
2009-08-05T03:40:00.000Z	Sahdos	georgefrs	 I'm pressy sure my dual core cpu is 32bit
2009-08-05T03:41:00.000Z	georgefrs	Sahdos	If your cpu doesn't support 64-bit, you can't run the 64-bit version of the OS
2009-08-05T03:41:00.000Z	Sahdos	georgefrs	 thank you
2009-08-05T03:41:00.000Z	georgefrs	Sahdos	do you know the model number of your cpu
2009-08-05T03:42:00.000Z	georgefrs	Sahdos	pop the result of "cat /proc/cpuinfo" into pastebin
2009-08-05T03:45:00.000Z	Sahdos	georgefrs	 you'll have to be more specific.  cat /proc/cpuinfo no such file or directory
2009-08-05T03:46:00.000Z	georgefrs	Sahdos	suprised you don't have that file. Are you running ubuntu?
2009-08-05T03:47:00.000Z	Sahdos	georgefrs	 I am running Ubuntu
2009-08-05T03:48:00.000Z	Sahdos	georgefrs	 lshw says logical cpu "width: 64 bits"
2009-08-05T03:49:00.000Z	Sahdos	georgefrs	 lshw says T2310
2009-08-05T03:50:00.000Z	georgefrs	Sahdos	Thats your cpu model number, and yes it supports 64 bit :)
2009-08-05T04:05:00.000Z	Sahdos	georgefrs	 I thought the benefits of 64bit cpus was the increased memory allocation, and that's about it.
2009-08-05T04:05:00.000Z	georgefrs	Sahdos	The longer instruction length also leads to better performance in floating point operation heavy code
