2008-05-11T00:59:00.000Z	fde	usser	Does that depend on flashplugin-nonfree and libflashsupport ? apt-cache show libflashsupport ...
2008-05-11T01:02:00.000Z	usser	fde	yes i believe it does
2008-05-11T01:03:00.000Z	fde	usser	I only ask cuz apt-cache show flashplugin-nonfree-pulse doesn't return anything... the package is there, but that info isn't... it'll be handy if it does.
2008-05-11T01:03:00.000Z	usser	fde	oh yea hm it wasnt installed on my comp so i guess advice is to apt-get libflashsupport thanks for noticing that
2008-05-11T01:06:00.000Z	usser	fde	wow now that i look thru repos it is indeed not there, but i've seen it a couple of days ago

2008-05-12T06:52:00.000Z	usser	fde	seen that one, must have writable permissions for "/" vsftpd doesnt allow that
2008-05-27T07:10:00.000Z	usser	fde	i think its sudo apt-get install medibuntu-keyring now

2008-05-31T09:10:00.000Z	fde	usser	It's no longer called that, it's now called the more appropriate "Hardware Drivers" same app though (jockey-gtk)

2009-02-20T07:07:00.000Z	fde	usser	apt-cache show hfsplus ... guessing is not useful
