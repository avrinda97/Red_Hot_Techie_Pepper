2007-05-02T11:45:00.000Z	derektgreen		I need to install my ATI X1600 drivers...my screen res isn't correct and the right options aren't available
2007-05-02T11:46:00.000Z	derektgreen		I need to install my ATI X1600 drivers...my screen res isn't correct and the right options aren't available
2007-05-02T11:48:00.000Z	derektgreen		yeah, everything crashed and I had to reinstall...I didn't know how to get it back to the way it was
2007-05-02T11:48:00.000Z	Nubbie	derektgreen	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2007-05-02T11:48:00.000Z	derektgreen	Nubbie	do I type that in a terminal?
2007-05-02T11:49:00.000Z	Nubbie	derektgreen	yes, it doesn't matter what terminal, even if you can't log in with gdm you can still run that from a tty.
2007-05-02T11:52:00.000Z	Nubbie	derektgreen	what video card do you have?
2007-05-02T11:52:00.000Z	derektgreen	Nubbie	ATI X1600 Pro
2007-05-02T11:53:00.000Z	Nubbie	derektgreen	if there's an ati driver or radeon drivers, use them. if not, use vesa.
2007-05-02T11:54:00.000Z	derektgreen	Nubbie	I downloaded drivers from ATI's site but when I tried to run it I get an error saying I "could not open the file" because gedit couldn't detect the character coding
2007-05-02T11:55:00.000Z	Nubbie	derektgreen	you don't open it with gedit... just do sudo apt-get install xserver-plugin-ati
2007-05-02T11:57:00.000Z	derektgreen	Nubbie	got an error "couldn't find package xserver-plugin-ati"
2007-05-02T12:02:00.000Z	derektgreen	Nubbie	that link instructs me to use the restricted drivers that I've already tried. If it locks up is there a way to restore everything to the way it was?
2007-05-02T12:02:00.000Z	Nubbie	derektgreen	just use vesa.
2007-05-02T12:02:00.000Z	derektgreen	Nubbie	thank you
2007-05-02T12:03:00.000Z	Nubbie	derektgreen	it will get you up and running again, then you can worry about 3d accelleration.
2007-05-02T12:04:00.000Z	derektgreen	Nubbie	would vga, via, vmware be any better?
2007-05-02T12:04:00.000Z	Nubbie	derektgreen	don't change the default plugins, skip through it all until you get to the screen resolutions
