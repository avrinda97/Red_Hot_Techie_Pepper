2010-05-12T17:18:00.000Z	AceKing		Can someone please help me. I started my toshiba laptop today and it comes up Network Disabled. I cannot access the internet either WiFi or ethernet Please help
2010-05-12T17:20:00.000Z	IdleOne	AceKing	do you have a ethernet switch on the laptop? it is a manual switch that turns network on and off
2010-05-12T17:20:00.000Z	AceKing	IdleOne	yes. I even switched it on and off again and restarted
2010-05-12T17:21:00.000Z	IdleOne	AceKing	ok well you want to restart it with the switch in ON position
2010-05-12T17:21:00.000Z	AceKing	IdleOne	I did
2010-05-12T17:21:00.000Z	AceKing	IdleOne	I can't even get on with the ethernet cable plugged in
2010-05-12T17:23:00.000Z	IdleOne	AceKing	try " ifdown eth0 && ifup eth0 " might restart it
2010-05-12T17:23:00.000Z	AceKing	IdleOne	Ok
2010-05-12T17:25:00.000Z	AceKing	IdleOne	ifdown failed to open statefile /var/run/network/ifstate: Permission denied I also tried putting sudo in front of it
2010-05-12T17:26:00.000Z	IdleOne	AceKing	ok I am not sure how to help but you now have an error you can look up. closer to finding a solution
