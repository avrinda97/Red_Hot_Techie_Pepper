2009-11-06T19:12:00.000Z	Tartaros		any suggestion for a gnome based hex editor?
2009-11-06T19:12:00.000Z	Tartaros		gedit apparently only handles text files
2009-11-06T19:12:00.000Z	h4f	Tartaros	just try searching google
2009-11-06T19:13:00.000Z	Tartaros	h4f	: very helpful
2009-11-21T22:37:00.000Z	h4f	Tartaros	 did you ever started firefox as root or other user ?
2009-11-21T22:38:00.000Z	Tartaros	h4f	no. I start it by tjhe default menu launcher, and I exited it last time because of new addons, by pressing the "restart firefox" button
2009-11-21T22:39:00.000Z	h4f	Tartaros	try starting it in safe mode from comand line
2009-11-21T22:39:00.000Z	Tartaros	h4f	safe-mode doesn't help
2009-11-21T22:41:00.000Z	Tartaros	h4f	no. Restarting is for windows pussies :)
2009-11-21T22:43:00.000Z	Tartaros	h4f	nothing
2009-11-21T22:44:00.000Z	h4f	Tartaros	try starting it from root gksudo firefox . As I am thinking you started it once as root. and now it changed some folder permissions
2009-11-21T22:46:00.000Z	h4f	Tartaros	any results
2009-11-21T22:47:00.000Z	Tartaros	h4f	well yeah it does start when run from gksudo
2009-11-21T22:48:00.000Z	h4f	Tartaros	so that means that some time ago you started it from root accidentaly. and now some folder permissions are changed to root. so you (user ) can access it. you either delete them or change permission back
2009-11-21T22:48:00.000Z	Tartaros	h4f	I can't see how it means I ran it in the past
2009-11-21T22:49:00.000Z	h4f	Tartaros	 did you ever start firefox from terminal ?
2009-11-21T22:49:00.000Z	Tartaros	h4f	I'd say it means that something is wrong with my firefox profile
2009-11-21T22:49:00.000Z	h4f	Tartaros	or may be some of your addon giving trouble. try creating new profile
