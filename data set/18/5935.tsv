2008-07-30T12:50:00.000Z	arelis		Hello everybody. My intel X3100 video card is being really slow in lots of games, such as Nexuiz. And it's one of the newest cards in laptops. Why, and how do i solve it?
2008-07-30T12:50:00.000Z	crdlb	arelis	3d performance with the open source drivers is not very good at the moment
2008-07-30T12:51:00.000Z	crdlb	arelis	improved X infrastructure will help in the future, particularly gallium and DRI2
2008-07-30T12:51:00.000Z	arelis	crdlb	so it's drivers are not yet good?
2008-07-30T12:51:00.000Z	crdlb	arelis	it's not a problem with the drivers really, but with the DRI infrastructure that all drivers other than nvidia use
2008-07-30T12:52:00.000Z	arelis	crdlb	ATI ran fine too
2008-07-30T12:52:00.000Z	crdlb	arelis	compiz is extremely light on gpu resources
2008-07-30T12:52:00.000Z	crdlb	arelis	what kind of ATI?
2008-07-30T12:52:00.000Z	arelis	crdlb	ATI Radeon 9600, although i had tons of problems with it
2008-07-30T12:53:00.000Z	crdlb	arelis	well, fglrx is a different story
2008-07-30T12:55:00.000Z	arelis	crdlb	so it's supposed to be so slow?
2008-07-30T12:58:00.000Z	crdlb	arelis	without gallium, the DRI stack cannot provide good throughput
2008-07-30T12:59:00.000Z	arelis	crdlb	openarena runs fine. But only with bloom off. Once i turn it on, it becomes slow.
2008-07-30T13:00:00.000Z	crdlb	arelis	there may be some tweaks that could help (but I don't know anything about them)
2008-07-30T13:02:00.000Z	arelis	crdlb	would you at least link me to a place with such tweaks?
2008-07-30T13:02:00.000Z	crdlb	arelis	I would if I knew of such a place
