2012-11-15T05:09:00.000Z	georgeph		wow that nvidia 6200 is a joke...it is the worst driver they have ever produced and it is not  even close to recent versions of vertex and pixel shaders
2012-11-15T05:10:00.000Z	bkc_	georgeph	what? 6200 is a HW model afaik, not a driver :/
2012-11-15T05:11:00.000Z	bkc_	georgeph	the driver isn't bad... the GPU is...
2012-11-15T05:12:00.000Z	bkc_	georgeph	indeed... that's the HW... not the SW...
2012-11-15T05:13:00.000Z	bkc_	georgeph	it's an OLD as (censor) low-budget INTEGRATED gpu... what did you really expect? (no offence, just irritated at people who talks outside proper context)
2012-11-15T05:14:00.000Z	georgeph	bkc_	well i was trying to get full opengl2.0 capability at a low low low price
2012-11-15T05:15:00.000Z	bkc_	georgeph	and it's EOL so don't expect the drivers to get any better... the driver doesn't add any new magical functions that makes it up to standards with todays gfx-cards...
2012-11-15T05:15:00.000Z	bkc_	georgeph	then you made a bad judgement-call... you're fault, not nvidias...
2012-11-15T05:16:00.000Z	bkc_	georgeph	SW-acceleration (like for instance Mesa pre-gallium3D) is slow. period. doesn't have ANYTHING on a modern card on any CPU...
2012-11-15T05:17:00.000Z	bkc_	georgeph	I can see why they disappered... it can't be done on todays CPUs...
2012-11-15T05:17:00.000Z	georgeph	bkc_	well i am not spending any money for anything unless i find some cheap junk in the junk piles
2012-11-15T05:17:00.000Z	bkc_	georgeph	and quite frankly, I can't see how it can ever be done... ever...
2012-11-15T05:17:00.000Z	bkc_	georgeph	then that's your problem...
2012-11-15T05:18:00.000Z	georgeph	bkc_	yeah been a problem for many many many years but some people are still using the xt so i am not alone with junk stuff
2012-11-15T05:19:00.000Z	bkc_	georgeph	I can relate... My current dev-machine is an old ThinkPad T43 from 2005... but your point is still WRONG
2012-11-15T05:20:00.000Z	bkc_	georgeph	and what did happen too Sun Enterprice exactly ;)
2012-11-15T05:22:00.000Z	bkc_	georgeph	actually TPM and SecureBoot aren't that common...
2012-11-15T05:24:00.000Z	bkc_	georgeph	'scuse me... are you a Troll? ^.^
