2005-01-05T11:10:00.000Z	bob2		well, it's not making an iso, it's dumping out whatever's in the .bin file
2005-01-05T11:11:00.000Z	bob2		no
2005-01-05T11:11:00.000Z	bob2		it's extracting whatever is in the .bin file
2005-01-05T11:11:00.000Z	bob2		can't you ask your "friend" what's in it?
2005-01-05T11:12:00.000Z	bob2		distrowatch numbers are completely meaningless, tho
2005-01-05T10:59:00.000Z	bob2		dude
2005-01-05T10:59:00.000Z	bob2		that means you need to run apt as root
2005-01-05T11:00:00.000Z	bob2		or it crashed at some point in the past
2005-01-05T11:00:00.000Z	bob2		or that you have two copies running
2005-01-05T11:00:00.000Z	bob2		unstable.
2005-01-05T11:01:00.000Z	pmfp	bob2	alright, thanks
2005-01-27T17:30:00.000Z	bob2	pmfp	Canonical
2005-01-27T17:30:00.000Z	pmfp	bob2	aha
2005-01-27T17:47:00.000Z	bob2	pmfp	yes
2005-01-27T17:47:00.000Z	bob2	pmfp	s/based on/is with minor mods/
2005-01-27T17:49:00.000Z	bob2	pmfp	using python means you'll never get it on a floppy
2005-01-27T17:49:00.000Z	bob2	pmfp	there's a few people (mainly colin, iirc) working on using gtkfb
2005-01-27T17:49:00.000Z	pmfp	bob2	I didn't know it was still available on a floppy :) Though even gtkfb on a floppy seems tough
