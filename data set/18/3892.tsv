2009-08-21T12:29:00.000Z	quantolf	ActionParsnip	i can run: sudo mount /dev/sdc1 /raid
2009-08-21T12:30:00.000Z	quantolf	ActionParsnip	my raid's managed by my 3ware hardware, i just want ubuntu to auto-mount on bootup
2009-08-21T12:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	quantolf	if you run: sudo fdisk -l      you will see the partitions, you can then add that to /etc/fstab
2009-08-21T12:31:00.000Z	quantolf	ActionParsnip	aye i've used that... i was tryign to automount using the UUID but i guess that'll be a nog o
2009-08-21T12:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	quantolf	you can use uuid
2009-08-21T12:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	quantolf	maybe you need some module loaded to get the card detected?
2009-08-21T12:33:00.000Z	quantolf	ActionParsnip	i used the UUID for the drive from blkid...altho i'm using type ext3 but with blkid it says it has secondary type of ext2
2009-08-21T12:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	quantolf	then add the module to /etc/modules
2009-08-21T12:34:00.000Z	quantolf	ActionParsnip	i don't know what module that is
2009-08-21T12:34:00.000Z	quantolf	ActionParsnip	also id on't know if is hould use type ext2 or ext3 for fstab
2009-08-21T12:35:00.000Z	quantolf	ActionParsnip	cuz in blkid it says type=ext3 and sec_type=ext2
2009-08-21T12:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	quantolf	then if you run: lspci   you can find the chip on the raid controller and see what it needs to get going
2009-08-21T12:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	quantolf	you would need to use some other command to find out the file system for that
2009-08-21T12:36:00.000Z	quantolf	ActionParsnip	i like that command, lspci, it's neat :D.  found this: 06:00.0 RAID bus controller: 3ware Inc 9650SE SATA-II RAID PCIe (rev 01)
2009-08-21T12:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	quantolf	then get websearhing
2009-08-21T12:37:00.000Z	quantolf	ActionParsnip	ok i'm gonna start my bingling.  also can you point me in a direction so i can learn start up scripts?
2009-08-21T12:38:00.000Z	quantolf	ActionParsnip	awesome, thank you :)
