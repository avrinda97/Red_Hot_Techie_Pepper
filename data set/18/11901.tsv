2006-11-30T06:39:00.000Z	livingdaylight		ok, realplay is not in my repositories
2006-11-30T06:41:00.000Z	bruenig	livingdaylight	what are you on edgy or dapper?
2006-11-30T06:42:00.000Z	livingdaylight	bruenig	edgy
2006-11-30T06:42:00.000Z	bruenig	livingdaylight	you need to add the PLF repo if you want to install it from the repositories. It is very easy to install it from the real player website. All you have to do is download and run a script that sets everything up.
2006-11-30T06:43:00.000Z	livingdaylight	bruenig	can you give me the plf thing?
2006-11-30T06:44:00.000Z	bruenig	livingdaylight	add this line to the /etc/apt/sources.list "deb http://packages.freecontrib.org/plf edgy-plf free non-free"
2006-11-30T06:45:00.000Z	livingdaylight	bruenig	what else is in there besides realplayer?
2006-11-30T06:45:00.000Z	bruenig	livingdaylight	then run wget http://packages.freecontrib.org/ubuntu/plf/12B83718.gpg -O- | sudo apt-key add -
2006-11-30T06:45:00.000Z	bruenig	livingdaylight	w32codecs probably. A whole bunch of questionably illegal stuff. I am sure libdvdcss is in there. Not sure on everything
2006-11-30T06:46:00.000Z	livingdaylight	bruenig	i think i already have that
2006-11-30T06:46:00.000Z	livingdaylight	bruenig	i cerainly have w32codecs and libdvdcss etc
2006-11-30T06:46:00.000Z	bruenig	livingdaylight	sudo apt-get update, sudo apt-get install realplay, at least that is what this guide is telling me.
2006-11-30T06:46:00.000Z	livingdaylight	bruenig	if you're getting it from the ubuntuguide.org then tht is what i've already done too
2007-01-06T06:29:00.000Z	livingdaylight	bruenig	yea, how do i know it will work though? i didn't get X with the live cd
2007-01-06T06:30:00.000Z	bruenig	livingdaylight	if you want to work at it, unless you built your own hardware from scratch, you will probably eventually be able to get it to work if it doesn't right from the start
2007-08-04T10:55:00.000Z	bruenig	livingdaylight	are you cded into it in the terminal?
2007-08-04T10:55:00.000Z	livingdaylight	bruenig	no, i've umounted now
2007-08-04T10:55:00.000Z	livingdaylight	bruenig	but only eventually, after some high-powered commands were thrown at it
