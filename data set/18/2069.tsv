2010-08-27T01:03:00.000Z	Anonissimus		is there a way I can make my machine reboot and force a boot from the cd drive?
2010-08-27T01:03:00.000Z	Aimee	Anonissimus	well
2010-08-27T01:03:00.000Z	Aimee		I don't think you can tell the machine what to boot from from the OS, but if you reboot then (on most computers) hit a button like F12
2010-08-27T01:04:00.000Z	Aimee		And select the boot device from there (@ Anonissimus )
2010-08-27T01:04:00.000Z	Aimee		Anyhow
2010-08-27T01:04:00.000Z	Anonissimus	Aimee	problem is this is a virtual machine
2010-08-27T01:04:00.000Z	Aimee		OH
2010-08-27T01:04:00.000Z	Anonissimus		so I dont get the boot menu
2010-08-27T01:04:00.000Z	Aimee		What software are you using
2010-08-27T01:04:00.000Z	Anonissimus		vmware
2010-08-27T01:04:00.000Z	Aimee		Ah
2010-08-27T01:05:00.000Z	Aimee	Anonissimus	I think you can do it uh
2010-08-27T01:05:00.000Z	Aimee		Stop your VM, open up the settings, and change it there
2010-08-27T01:05:00.000Z	Aimee		I don't think you can force a reboot to a different device though
2010-08-27T01:05:00.000Z	Anonissimus	Aimee	I am pretty sure I can, but I cant find it otherwise I wouldnt ask
2010-08-27T01:05:00.000Z	Aimee		Oh
2010-08-27T01:05:00.000Z	Aimee		The only way I know how to do it in VMWare is to change your VM settings
2010-08-27T01:06:00.000Z	Anonissimus	Aimee	found I can get into the boot menu by checking a box
