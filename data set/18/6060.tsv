2008-07-15T04:54:00.000Z	MrKennie	RazorBeamz	I answered your question
2008-07-15T04:55:00.000Z	MrKennie	RazorBeamz	easiest thing to do is remove that file and add it again as per the medibuntu howto.
2008-07-15T04:56:00.000Z	RazorBeamz	MrKennie	I'm not sure what you mean
2008-07-15T04:56:00.000Z	MrKennie	RazorBeamz	the file appears to have the contents of a webpage in it
2008-07-15T04:57:00.000Z	RazorBeamz	MrKennie	That error shows up any time I try to use sudo apt-get. I can't update or install anything
2008-07-15T04:57:00.000Z	MrKennie	RazorBeamz	the easiest thing to do is remove that file and follow the guide here https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Medibuntu
2008-07-15T04:57:00.000Z	RazorBeamz	MrKennie	I'm not sure you understand my problem
2008-07-15T04:58:00.000Z	MrKennie	RazorBeamz	I beleive I understand. Do you intend to use the medibuntu repository?
2008-07-15T04:58:00.000Z	MrKennie	RazorBeamz	or not
