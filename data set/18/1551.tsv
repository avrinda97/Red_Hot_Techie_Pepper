2011-01-23T07:32:00.000Z	MACscr		i like to play games every so often and i really hate the fact that i have to close all my work (i have like 30 windows open right now) and reboot into windows. Then when im done, i have to open it all back up. Any way for it to dump the session to the drive so i can open it later?
2011-01-23T07:33:00.000Z	dismo	MACscr	does hibernate not work?`
2011-01-23T07:33:00.000Z	dismo	MACscr	you have to have a big enough swap partition.
2011-01-23T07:34:00.000Z	dismo	MACscr	swap >= ram
2011-01-23T07:34:00.000Z	MACscr	dismo	i wouldnt think that would work for my purpose. Would it? I have 8gb of ram, so a 16gb swap seemed a bit crazy
2011-01-23T07:35:00.000Z	dismo	MACscr	but then you can't hibernate imho
2011-01-23T07:35:00.000Z	MACscr	dismo	but i dont think hibernate will even work for my purpose
2011-01-23T07:37:00.000Z	dismo	MACscr	i think hibernate will do exactly what you want.
2011-01-23T07:38:00.000Z	MACscr	dismo	i am at least using two different hard drives for the two os's, so that should help a bit. I have no problem expanding my swap if its going to work the way i need it to. guess i just need to find more details on it.
2011-01-23T07:39:00.000Z	dismo	MACscr	ok. be save :-)
2011-01-23T07:40:00.000Z	dismo	MACscr	hmm? what?
2011-01-23T07:41:00.000Z	dismo	MACscr	swap needs to be equal or greater than ram. that is all
2011-01-23T07:53:00.000Z	dismo	MACscr	not sure if xfs is resizable but you can also create a file for additinonal swap space
2011-01-23T07:55:00.000Z	dismo	MACscr	man xfs_growfs
2011-01-23T07:55:00.000Z	dismo	MACscr	you may need to install it first
2011-01-23T08:18:00.000Z	dismo	MACscr	should be an option now when shutting down. you may have to (logout, restart acpi, etc...,) easiest to just reboot
2011-01-23T08:19:00.000Z	MACscr	dismo	ok, so i i see the option to hibernate. Once it goes into that mode, what should i do? Press the power button to start the system again and then i should get the grub boot options?
2011-01-23T08:20:00.000Z	dismo	MACscr	i guess. never tried it myself :-)
