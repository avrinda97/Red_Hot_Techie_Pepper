2009-08-28T02:29:00.000Z	mickster04	Sam___	try doing the disk check
2009-08-28T02:30:00.000Z	mickster04	Sam___	there is an option to check the disk for errors
2009-08-28T02:31:00.000Z	Sam___	mickster04	anyoption get freezes, and mi disk has windows, but with a free partition , thatas where i wanna put the ubuntu, but it get freezes
2009-08-28T02:31:00.000Z	mickster04	Sam___	well it sounds like the disk is broken, m5hash sum?
2009-08-28T02:33:00.000Z	Sam___	mickster04	i end up installing kubuntu in that partition, i don't think that the disk is the problem, because it happens in three different pcs, do you think that the windows is making a conflict?
2009-08-28T02:33:00.000Z	mickster04	Sam___	if the disk doesnt work in three pcs the cd is dead
2009-08-28T02:38:00.000Z	Sam___	mickster04	but i burned other cd, it was with 3 different CDs, from 3 differents downloaded files, that happened to a workparter too, it can't be that both CDs are dead
2009-08-28T02:38:00.000Z	mickster04	Sam___	o i c
2009-08-28T02:38:00.000Z	mickster04	Sam___	unlucky then?
2009-08-28T02:40:00.000Z	Sam___	mickster04	you think that it could be the graphical driver? althougt the pcs are hp, dell and compaq
2009-08-28T02:40:00.000Z	mickster04	Sam___	i still think u should do the m5 hash sum check thing on the downloads
2009-08-28T02:43:00.000Z	Sam___	mickster04	well i'll do that, but i used one of the CDs with a Compaq Laptop and it works, just that the Laptop had only that operating system, no Windows
2009-08-28T02:46:00.000Z	mickster04	Sam___	they are unrelated...it should just work, have u tried all the other option available to you or does the language election come up first
2009-08-28T02:47:00.000Z	Sam___	mickster04	the language come first, i select one, then i can move over the 6 o 7 menus, but when i push Enter on one of them, the screen freezes
2009-08-28T02:48:00.000Z	mickster04	Sam___	no idae buddy sorry keep askin ho]
