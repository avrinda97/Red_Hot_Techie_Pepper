2011-10-11T13:11:00.000Z	skipr		hello, I have a problem
2011-10-11T13:11:00.000Z	skipr		I installed kernel 3.0.4 on my laptop with ubuntu 10.10
2011-10-11T13:11:00.000Z	skipr		and now runway 6 (for gdm3) is spazzing strangely
2011-10-11T13:11:00.000Z	skipr		and after a few minutes it just dies and goes back to tty1
2011-10-11T13:12:00.000Z	skipr		anyone?
2011-10-11T13:12:00.000Z	skipr		SOMEONE
2011-10-11T13:12:00.000Z	skipr		this is not #windows
2011-10-11T13:13:00.000Z	dr_willis	skipr	 you are using gnome3 on 10.10 ?
2011-10-11T13:13:00.000Z	skipr	dr_willis	no, im not using 11.10, im using 10.10
2011-10-11T13:15:00.000Z	skipr	dr_willis	plz help, I don't have much time left
2011-10-11T13:16:00.000Z	dr_willis	skipr	 i dont even know why you decided to put a newer kernel in 10.10 -  i dont mess with kernels.
2011-10-11T13:16:00.000Z	dr_willis	skipr	 i dont even know what 'runway 6 for gdm3' is either..
2011-10-11T13:17:00.000Z	skipr	dr_willis	by runway 6 i meant ctrl+shift+F6
2011-10-11T13:17:00.000Z	dr_willis	skipr	 gdm is a LOGIN manager...  and alt-ctrl-F6 would get you to a console... so whats the actual issue?
2011-10-11T13:18:00.000Z	skipr	dr_willis	my computer switches from C+S+F6 to F7 and back again like crazy
2011-10-11T13:18:00.000Z	dr_willis	skipr	 so you are saying that GDM is crashing and restarting?  you got ssh installed? you chould ssh in from a differnt box and stop the gdm service.
2011-10-11T13:19:00.000Z	skipr	dr_willis	i tried to stop it and then I am at tty1
2011-10-11T13:19:00.000Z	dr_willis	skipr	 if you get back to the consoles, try 'startx' and look for error messages
