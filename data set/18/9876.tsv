2008-06-25T07:30:00.000Z	baegle		I'm trying to install ubuntu amd64 on an intel Core 2 quad. However, Whenever I get to run the live CD or try to install from the live CD, I get dropped to the initramfs prompt. What can I do to troubleshoot this situation. dmesg is giving me very few hints.
2008-06-25T07:31:00.000Z	genii	baegle	Try from an external USB cd drive
2008-06-25T07:33:00.000Z	genii	baegle	I had this exact issue on an Asus P5K board, it was the controller for the IDE/SATA which meant installer could not understand what device it was using to boot and drops to busybox. But usb cd works to at least get it running
2008-06-25T07:39:00.000Z	baegle	genii	when you said USB cd you mean a cd drive that connects via USB?
2008-06-25T07:39:00.000Z	genii	baegle	Correct. An external drive connected through USB port
2008-06-25T07:40:00.000Z	baegle	genii	hmmm, I don't have one of those.....
2008-06-25T07:45:00.000Z	baegle	genii	did you receive the message "no common CD-ROM device found."
2008-06-25T07:47:00.000Z	genii	baegle	Something to that effect, yes
2008-06-25T07:47:00.000Z	baegle	genii	I'm not getting that problem. Did you have SATA opticals? I have IDE opticals
2008-06-25T07:48:00.000Z	genii	baegle	I have IDE optical drives but the controller for it is integrated with the SATA controller and so it did not work out-of-box.
2008-06-25T07:49:00.000Z	baegle	genii	That's kind of bunk that I have to buy new hardware just to install Ubuntu
2008-06-25T07:50:00.000Z	genii	baegle	If you have some ancient hard drive cntroller card around it would work to use for installing.
2008-06-25T07:50:00.000Z	baegle	genii	you mean like a PCI IDE controller or something?
2008-06-25T07:50:00.000Z	genii	baegle	Yes
2008-06-25T07:50:00.000Z	genii	baegle	Like a Promise TX133 or something
2008-06-25T07:52:00.000Z	baegle	genii	I'm using the main CD.
2008-06-25T07:52:00.000Z	baegle	genii	and no, I don't have an IDE controller
2008-06-25T07:53:00.000Z	genii	baegle	As philh suggests perhaps try the alternate. It does have some more drivers on it like nvidia SATA controller drivers and marvell SATA controller drivers.
