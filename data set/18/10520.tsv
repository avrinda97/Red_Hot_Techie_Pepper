2006-11-20T13:49:00.000Z	seifip		i have just upgraded from 6.06 to 6.10 and when I reboot I dont get anything
2006-11-20T13:49:00.000Z	seifip		I thought that it is the xserver error but when I execute the "sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg" command it says that the package isnt avaible :/
2006-11-20T13:50:00.000Z	seifip		How can i correct it?

2006-11-20T13:52:00.000Z	seifip		axion: and what should i check/change there?
2006-11-20T13:52:00.000Z	rioghal	seifip	i believe the xserver is  xserver-xorg-core
2006-11-20T13:52:00.000Z	seifip	rioghal	i tried to reinstall only the core - same error :/
2006-11-20T13:53:00.000Z	rioghal	seifip	try apt-cache policy xserver-xorg-core  to see if its already installed
2006-11-20T13:53:00.000Z	seifip	rioghal	I tried to reconfigure it and it says it isnt installed
2006-11-20T13:53:00.000Z	rioghal	seifip	oh ok
2006-11-20T13:54:00.000Z	rioghal	seifip	what is the command you used to try reconfiguring it
2006-11-20T13:54:00.000Z	seifip	rioghal	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2006-11-20T13:54:00.000Z	rioghal	seifip	ok, that right
