2009-06-10T17:28:00.000Z	wWales		funkyhat: i mean the lower part of the screen is "outside" the monitor :)
2009-06-10T17:28:00.000Z	cankoy	wWales	tried different refresh rate?
2009-06-10T17:29:00.000Z	wWales	cankoy	the nvidia tool lets me choose "auto" or "60" same problem in both
2009-06-10T17:31:00.000Z	cankoy	wWales	there's Prefs > Display menu, but I dont know if it works for the proprietary nvidia driver.
2009-06-10T17:36:00.000Z	wWales	cankoy	manged to start the ubuntu display conf tool, same results :(
2009-06-10T17:40:00.000Z	cankoy	wWales	check the output of xrandr (though I doubt it will show meaningful output under nvidia)
2009-06-10T17:43:00.000Z	wWales	cankoy	how do i produce an outputfile from xrand?
2009-06-10T17:43:00.000Z	cankoy	wWales	the command is xrandr, use terminal
2009-06-10T17:44:00.000Z	wWales	cankoy	800x600        59.0     60.0     72.0
2009-06-10T17:45:00.000Z	cankoy	wWales	do you see 'LVDS connected' in output?
2009-06-10T17:48:00.000Z	wWales	cankoy	its says Signal: LVDS and Connection: Dual
2009-06-10T17:49:00.000Z	wWales	cankoy	xrandr output doesnt mention it
2009-06-10T17:51:00.000Z	cankoy	wWales	using a second monitor?
2009-06-10T17:51:00.000Z	cankoy	wWales	like dual head?

2009-06-10T17:55:00.000Z	wWales	cankoy	thanks for looking into the problem, im afraid ill have to leave for work now tho :(
2009-06-11T16:21:00.000Z	wWales	cankoy	hi again, had any new ideas on the 800x600 resolution problem? :)
2009-06-11T16:25:00.000Z	cankoy	wWales	since you're using the proprietary nvidia drv, I suggest you visit http://www.nvnews.net/vbulletin/forumdisplay.php?f=13
