2010-10-23T23:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ubuntunoobz	 it pays to research whats out there. and fits your budget.
2010-10-23T23:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ubuntunoobz	 find a high end laptop with a good nvidia card. :) thats what i did.
2010-10-23T23:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ubuntunoobz	 it also cost me close to $1000
2010-10-23T23:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ubuntunoobz	  look for a low end nvidia system I guess...
2010-10-23T23:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ubuntunoobz	 but really for  a bit more $$ you can get a LOT nicer system. I splurged this time.. beucase i  got sick of the $300 range laptops
2010-10-23T23:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ubuntunoobz	 :) i got 2. 500GB hd's   yes. this laptop is a Back-breaker.. heh
2010-10-23T23:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ubuntunoobz	 it has enough powar to run Crysis at high settings. :)
2010-10-23T23:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ubuntunoobz	 does it run fear well on windows? wine can be slower.. but it depends on the game
