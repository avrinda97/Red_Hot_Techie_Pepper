2009-10-08T22:26:00.000Z	Bmachine		hello room, if i restore a database over another one through ssh, does it just append it, or overwrite it completely?
2009-10-08T22:27:00.000Z	joaopinto	Bmachine	uh, that's a very unclear question, it depends on which type of database, and how you restore it
2009-10-08T22:29:00.000Z	joaopinto	Bmachine	please keep it on the channel, tks
2009-10-08T22:29:00.000Z	Bmachine	joaopinto	ok, on a ubuntu server, im restoring a sql backup i made of a database called db1 on top of db1 using this command : mysql -u -p databasename < backup.sql
2009-10-08T22:29:00.000Z	joaopinto	Bmachine	if you want a clean restore, recreate the database on the restore system before imporing the data.
2009-10-08T22:29:00.000Z	joaopinto	Bmachine	unless your .sql already contains drop tables...
2009-10-08T22:29:00.000Z	Bmachine		how do you recreate it?
2009-10-08T22:30:00.000Z	joaopinto	Bmachine	you drop it and you create it
2009-10-08T22:30:00.000Z	Bmachine		so executing drop commands on all the tables is "recreating it"?
2009-10-08T22:30:00.000Z	joaopinto	Bmachine	I was refering to the database, but yes, you could also truncate the tables, if they are not that much
2009-10-08T22:31:00.000Z	joaopinto	Bmachine	but, depending on how you generate the .sql backup, it may already contain the drop tables
2009-10-08T22:31:00.000Z	Bmachine		sorry for the noobness, but droping is basically deleting correct?
2009-10-08T22:32:00.000Z	joaopinto	Bmachine	dropping, is destroying, a database or a table
2009-10-08T22:32:00.000Z	Bmachine	joaopinto	and truncating is clearing it right?
2009-10-08T22:32:00.000Z	joaopinto	Bmachine	you really need some DB basic skills :)
2009-10-08T22:32:00.000Z	joaopinto	Bmachine	correct
2009-10-08T22:32:00.000Z	Bmachine	joaopinto	thanks, im really working backwards unfortunatly, i know the commands, just not the vocab
2009-10-08T22:34:00.000Z	Bmachine	joaopinto	thank you for your help.
