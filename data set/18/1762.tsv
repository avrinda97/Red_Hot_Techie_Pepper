2010-11-18T15:17:00.000Z	danms		I've created a user. How do I make him access my external drive? I can't seem to chmod /media/drivename?
2010-11-18T15:18:00.000Z	danms		not with my new user
2010-11-18T15:19:00.000Z	danms		it 's a hd in three partitions, filesystem, music and movies
2010-11-18T15:20:00.000Z	danms		it can access the file system
2010-11-18T15:20:00.000Z	danms		when I try to cd into the other partitions it says I'm not allowed to do that
2010-11-18T15:20:00.000Z	danms		yes
2010-11-18T15:20:00.000Z	danms		my new user isn't in the sudo file
2010-11-18T15:21:00.000Z	pol90	danms	have you tried to include your new user in the sudoers list?
2010-11-18T15:21:00.000Z	danms		I've tried following this: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FilePermissions
2010-11-18T15:22:00.000Z	danms		but I'm not sure what I need to change permissions on
2010-11-18T15:22:00.000Z	danms		tried the devices in /media/, but might be totally off track
2010-11-18T15:23:00.000Z	pol90		hmm
2010-11-18T15:23:00.000Z	pol90		you just lost me
2010-11-18T15:24:00.000Z	danms		#!/usr/bin/env python
2010-11-18T15:25:00.000Z	danms		use that
2010-11-18T15:25:00.000Z	danms	pol90	were you talking to me?
2010-11-18T15:27:00.000Z	pol90		hotkeys & the 'fn' key do not work in my recently bought HP G62, anyone?
2010-11-18T15:27:00.000Z	pol90	danms	yes, i was talking to you xdd
