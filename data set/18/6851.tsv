2009-03-18T08:51:00.000Z	Gentoon		I did sudo passwd and now the lil GUI that asks for root permissions when running things like symantic is broken, how can i fix it?
2009-03-18T08:52:00.000Z	Gentoon		Doesn't seem they actually do support here
2009-03-18T08:53:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	Gentoon	everyone here is just users like you. there are no official ubuntu reps here
2009-03-18T08:53:00.000Z	Gentoon	kindofabuzz	Yes I know this, what is your point/
2009-03-18T08:54:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	Gentoon	i thought you were complaining about you not getting any help or something
2009-03-18T08:54:00.000Z	Gentoon	kindofabuzz	I was, this is a support channel
2009-03-18T08:55:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	Gentoon	ever thought that no one knows an answer to your problem. and remember, google is your buddie
2009-03-18T08:55:00.000Z	Gentoon	kindofabuzz	Go away, it is a simple question and I did google, don't assume things.
2009-03-18T08:57:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	Gentoon	if you'd actuall explain your question instead of "I did sudo passwd and now the lil GUI that asks for root permissions when running things like symantic is broken, how can i fix it?' you might get better help
2009-03-18T08:58:00.000Z	Gentoon	kindofabuzz	Just because you don't understand things doesn't mean it wasn't explained well. Now STFU I don't want help from you, you don't know what you are talking about.
2009-03-18T08:58:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	Gentoon	you probably enabled the root account didn't you?
2009-03-18T08:58:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	Gentoon	neither do you looks like.
2009-03-18T08:58:00.000Z	Gentoon	kindofabuzz	Obviously, thats what sudo passwd does, god.
2009-03-18T08:59:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	Gentoon	yeah, and if you googled like you said you'd see that that can break things.
2009-03-18T08:59:00.000Z	Gentoon	kindofabuzz	I obviously already know it can break things, thats why i am here. Do you have a disability or something?
2009-03-18T09:00:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	Gentoon	try disabling the root account, not that hard. usually when you mess something up the simple thing to do is to reverse it
2009-03-18T09:00:00.000Z	kindofabuzz	Gentoon	i think you do, i just told you 3 times what to do
2009-03-18T09:00:00.000Z	Gentoon	kindofabuzz	Thats what I am here to find out how to do, as I have already stated 6 times now, just don't talk please.
