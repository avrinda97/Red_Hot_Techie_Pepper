2010-06-13T13:52:00.000Z	chelz	akssps011	gather a bunch of info about your computer and post on the forums about it
2010-06-13T13:53:00.000Z	akssps011	chelz	tried in ubuntuforums, but no response their.
2010-06-13T13:54:00.000Z	akssps011	chelz	I have 1.24 GB RAM, 1GB swap space, 80GB HDD, P4 ? Hibernation worked in 9.10 but not in 10.04
2010-06-13T13:54:00.000Z	akssps011	chelz	I upgraded from 9.10 to 10.04
2010-06-13T13:55:00.000Z	akssps011	chelz	any idea ?
2010-06-13T13:55:00.000Z	chelz	akssps011	uhm you could try shrinking your partition, then installing to another partition to see if the issue is upgrade-related
2010-06-13T13:56:00.000Z	akssps011	chelz	you mean using gparted and then reinstall ?
2010-06-13T13:56:00.000Z	chelz	akssps011	yeah, to test
2010-06-13T13:57:00.000Z	chelz	akssps011	you can grow your main partition after. make sure you know how to reinstall grub though
2010-06-13T13:57:00.000Z	akssps011	chelz	but it worked with 9.10 and problem aroused the moment I upgraded to 10.04. So isn't update the problem ?
2010-06-13T13:58:00.000Z	chelz	akssps011	the problem may be not due to the upgrade tho, it may just be part of 10.04
