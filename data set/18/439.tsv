2012-02-17T03:14:00.000Z	cfhowlett	harry7	  nver mind -- you meant fresh.  Right?
2012-02-17T03:15:00.000Z	cfhowlett	harry7	  seen this?  http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1860135
2012-02-17T03:29:00.000Z	harry7	cfhowlett	 i read the post you gave me. it instructs me to see the boot in verbose mode while it loads the OS, so to understand what hapens and what hangs up. but ive been able to to that by choosing ubuntu recovery and see that there is something wrong with "ATA link is slow (error 16)"
2012-02-17T03:30:00.000Z	cfhowlett	harry7	  remind me of your problem?
2012-02-17T03:30:00.000Z	cfhowlett	harry7	  nevermind pink login right?
2012-02-17T03:32:00.000Z	cfhowlett	harry7	  more research needed - seems to be a hardware/kernel conflict...
2012-02-17T03:34:00.000Z	cfhowlett	harry7	  boot windows/accessories/system utilities/system info: get the specs on your HDD, i.e. ATA, SATA, etc.  reboot ubuntu and make sure you matched those settings
2012-02-17T03:39:00.000Z	harry7	cfhowlett	 as i remember my hdd its a ata 200gb partitioned in 3 partitions. win7ntfs C+D, and ubuntu xt4
2012-02-17T03:40:00.000Z	harry7	cfhowlett	 now that one is gone.
2012-02-17T03:41:00.000Z	harry7	cfhowlett	i didnt want to let all those gigs for win
2012-02-17T03:41:00.000Z	cfhowlett	harry7	  so your buntu HDD settings are ATA?  See Ubuntu Disk Utilities
2012-02-17T03:44:00.000Z	harry7	cfhowlett	omg i dont have disk utility
2012-02-17T03:45:00.000Z	cfhowlett	harry7	  you have it, but it's not obvious.  Ask someone using your version of buntu - I only boot LTS so I'm on 10.04
2012-02-17T03:47:00.000Z	harry7	cfhowlett	i found it
2012-02-17T03:48:00.000Z	harry7	cfhowlett	 my hdd is 200gb, disk is healthy,location Port 1 of SATA host adapter, Connection ATA
2012-02-17T03:49:00.000Z	cfhowlett	harry7	  OK then, we now know that buntu correctly ID'd the HDD.  That's good.  Sadly, it also means IDK what the heck is going on with your box.  Sorry.  Plz ask the channel again...
2012-02-17T03:52:00.000Z	harry7	cfhowlett	when i boot on 11.10 it hang on the purple screen. CTRL+ALT+DEL and than i try ubuntu recovery. after i see a lot of (ata slow to respond error 16 ) it gives up and throws me on i(initramfs). from there i do "exit" and than it starts to load the OS.
