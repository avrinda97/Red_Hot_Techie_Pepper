2011-02-10T17:50:00.000Z	MarcRichter		Hi there, I've encountering strange Problems with Ubuntu 1004 Server LTS on our Servers and haven't found anything with google.
2011-02-10T17:51:00.000Z	MarcRichter		When I reboot a machine, then all the net-interfaces seem to come up correctly - the routes are properly set, the IPs are up and so on.
2011-02-10T17:51:00.000Z	MarcRichter		But the machine is not reachable nor can it ping somewhere.
2011-02-10T17:51:00.000Z	MarcRichter		Only after issuing a /etc/init.d/networking restart everything works.
2011-02-10T17:52:00.000Z	twitch	MarcRichter	are u on the corrent subnet?
2011-02-10T17:52:00.000Z	MarcRichter	twitch	Jes
2011-02-10T17:52:00.000Z	twitch	MarcRichter	are u filtering icmp ?
2011-02-10T17:55:00.000Z	MarcRichter	twitch	No, nothing of that
2011-02-10T17:56:00.000Z	MarcRichter	twitch	It is a complete normal out-of-the-box setup Server and it is connected to a Cisco switch, which filters nothing.
2011-02-10T17:56:00.000Z	twitch	MarcRichter	if your on the same subnet but  u cannot recive icmp packets there must be a firewall/filter
2011-02-10T17:57:00.000Z	MarcRichter	twitch	No, it isn't. The point is, that it only does not work after a reboot and this initial net-device initialisation. As soon as I issue a networking restart, everything works.
2011-02-10T17:58:00.000Z	twitch	MarcRichter	wow thats weird u restart and it works?
2011-02-10T17:58:00.000Z	twitch	MarcRichter	the device that is
2011-02-10T17:58:00.000Z	MarcRichter	twitch	Exactly.

2011-02-10T18:02:00.000Z	MarcRichter	twitch	Sorry?
