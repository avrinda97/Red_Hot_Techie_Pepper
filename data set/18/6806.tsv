2008-10-31T13:25:00.000Z	DistroJockey	sken	what package did you install?
2008-10-31T13:26:00.000Z	DistroJockey	sken	there is no package called Googleearth.  There is a package called  googleearth-package though
2008-10-31T13:27:00.000Z	DistroJockey	sken	is that the one you mean?
2008-10-31T13:28:00.000Z	DistroJockey	sken	that doens't make a shortcut as it's just the installer/configuration tool
2008-10-31T13:30:00.000Z	DistroJockey	sken	as you can see the description and lack of instructions is not helpful
2008-10-31T13:31:00.000Z	DistroJockey	sken	I guess this is the way to go:  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GoogleEarth#Installation
2008-10-31T13:32:00.000Z	DistroJockey	sken	but the package should be more helpful IMHO
2008-10-31T13:32:00.000Z	DistroJockey	sken	you're welcome
2008-10-31T13:33:00.000Z	DistroJockey	sken	In My Honest Opinion
2008-10-31T13:33:00.000Z	DistroJockey	sken	the googleearth-package should atleast tell you how to run it :)
2008-10-31T13:34:00.000Z	DistroJockey	sken	but it doesn't :(
2008-10-31T13:34:00.000Z	DistroJockey	sken	np
