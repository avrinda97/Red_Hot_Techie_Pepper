2008-07-12T05:16:00.000Z	Sylphid	powertool08	does it have to be vnc
2008-07-12T05:16:00.000Z	powertool08	Sylphid	what else would it be?
2008-07-12T05:17:00.000Z	Sylphid	powertool08	NX or X11 forwarding
2008-07-12T05:17:00.000Z	powertool08	Sylphid	pros/cons of each of those compared to vnc?
2008-07-12T05:18:00.000Z	Sylphid	powertool08	NX creates a new X session for each connection so it is not useful if you want the server side to see what is going on
2008-07-12T05:19:00.000Z	Sylphid	powertool08	X11 is the same but only forwards the app that you start instead of the entire X session
2008-07-12T05:21:00.000Z	powertool08	Sylphid	I think vnc is a better option for what I want
2008-07-12T05:21:00.000Z	Sylphid	powertool08	is the server on a windows or *nix OS?
2008-07-12T05:23:00.000Z	powertool08	Sylphid	server is ubuntu hardy, client will be xp/arch lappy, possibly other various xp/vista machines
2008-07-12T05:23:00.000Z	powertool08	Sylphid	I was wanting to set it up so only localhost could view tunneled over ssh2
2008-07-12T05:24:00.000Z	Sylphid	powertool08	if the server is *nix i would use tightvnc
2008-07-12T05:25:00.000Z	Sylphid	powertool08	for a windows client/server i would use ultravnc
2008-07-12T05:25:00.000Z	powertool08	Sylphid	any specific reason or just personal preferences?
2008-07-12T05:26:00.000Z	Sylphid	powertool08	tight has better compression so better speeds ..... ultra has lots of extra tools like file copying and chat etc as well as the extra compression
2008-07-12T05:28:00.000Z	powertool08	Sylphid	Ok, thanks, I'll try those out
2008-07-12T05:29:00.000Z	Sylphid	powertool08	if your looking to just work on a home computer from away i would highly recommend X11 forwarding
2008-07-12T05:29:00.000Z	Sylphid	powertool08	you can do X11 forwarding on windows using XMing
