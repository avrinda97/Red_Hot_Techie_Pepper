2011-12-14T19:32:00.000Z	olivier__		Am I the only one that has issues with shutdowns involving smbfs ? As a matter of fact, my Pcs take minutes to shutdown instead of seconds, and they seem to hang on the samba folders unmounting.
2011-12-14T19:33:00.000Z	olivier__		Does someone know how to properly unmount smbfs folders at shutdown ?
2011-12-14T19:34:00.000Z	compdoc	olivier__	samba?
2011-12-14T19:36:00.000Z	olivier__	compdoc	: yes samba is the service managing the shared folders. But my problem is within the client, not the server (as far as I know)
2011-12-14T19:36:00.000Z	compdoc	olivier__	whats the problem?
2011-12-14T19:38:00.000Z	olivier__	compdoc	: At shutdown, the system hangs for several minutes. The logs are showing it's waiting for the smb shares to unmount. Manually they can be unmounted without any problem.
2011-12-14T19:40:00.000Z	compdoc	olivier__	I have never seen that. I dont think its normal
2011-12-14T19:40:00.000Z	olivier__	compdoc	I don't thing either, but it happens on at least two of my 10.04 boxes
2011-12-14T19:41:00.000Z	compdoc	olivier__	try #samba, and if you find out, let me know
2011-12-14T19:42:00.000Z	olivier__	compdoc	can you try to do the same, just to see whether it's a general issue or specific to me ?
2011-12-14T19:43:00.000Z	compdoc	olivier__	unfortunately, with different hardware and whomever installed it, it can be many problems
2011-12-14T19:45:00.000Z	olivier__	compdoc	It happens on very different machines here. One has only to setup a smbfs mount in fstab, and see if it slows the shutdown
2011-12-14T19:47:00.000Z	compdoc	olivier__	oh, I see. smbfs. a file system. I use ext3/4
2011-12-14T19:48:00.000Z	compdoc	olivier__	I dont think Ive ever used or seen smbfs
2011-12-14T19:49:00.000Z	olivier__	compdoc	it's very handy for managing samba shares that have to be automatically mounted
2011-12-14T19:49:00.000Z	compdoc	olivier__	I use smb.conf - not as handy, I bet
2011-12-14T20:18:00.000Z	compdoc	olivier__	this is from the samba.org website: "smbfs has not been maintained in the last few years. Instead, development has been focused on another implementation of the CIFS protocol in the kernel. "
2011-12-14T20:22:00.000Z	olivier__	compdoc	actually, it's cifs that is declared in fstab, not smbfs
