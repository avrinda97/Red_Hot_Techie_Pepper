2005-03-31T10:25:00.000Z	DonL	nicedreams	did you edit your etc/X11 file?

2005-03-31T10:26:00.000Z	nicedreams	DonL	the opengl was running fast
2005-03-31T10:26:00.000Z	nicedreams	DonL	and now it's sloooooow
2005-03-31T10:26:00.000Z	DonL	nicedreams	if you don't edit the file to use the new driver, I think when you reboot, it will go back to nv
2005-03-31T10:27:00.000Z	nicedreams	DonL	it's still nvidia
2005-03-31T10:27:00.000Z	nicedreams	DonL	the xorg.conf looks fine
