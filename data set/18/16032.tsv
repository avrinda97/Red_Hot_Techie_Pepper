2004-11-27T16:18:00.000Z	labanux		but i'm gonna live Ubuntu myself...
2004-11-27T16:18:00.000Z	labanux		it's confusing using Ubuntu...
2004-11-27T16:18:00.000Z	labanux		i'ev install GTK+ packages.., but even the header (gtk.h) is not exist in my system..
2004-11-27T16:20:00.000Z	geoffj	labanux	gtk.h is in libgtk2.0-dev
2004-11-27T16:25:00.000Z	labanux	geoffj	i've installed the library ..
2004-11-27T16:26:00.000Z	geoffj	labanux	do you have /usr/include/gtk-2.0/gtk/gtk.h?
2004-11-27T16:28:00.000Z	geoffj	labanux	what doesn't work?
2004-11-27T16:29:00.000Z	geoffj	labanux	I've only got it installed on debian, I'll try under ubuntu
2004-11-27T16:32:00.000Z	geoffj	labanux	I just looked on the ubuntu CD and could not see libgtk2.0-dev. Did you get it off the net?
2004-11-27T16:35:00.000Z	geoffj	labanux	I can't see the -dev package there
2004-11-27T16:36:00.000Z	geoffj	labanux	I think you'll need to get it off the net. You'll need to enable it in synaptic
2004-11-27T16:38:00.000Z	geoffj	labanux	Nope, by the looks of it the -dev package is not shipped on the CD
2004-11-27T16:39:00.000Z	geoffj	labanux	yep, much more fundemental packages :)
2004-11-27T16:39:00.000Z	geoffj	labanux	gtk2.0-dev is in main so universe not need but probably good to enable anyway
2004-11-27T16:42:00.000Z	geoffj	labanux	I don't know. I would not recommend doing that; instead install package as you need them. Use the debian package search engine if you are looking for something in particular.
2004-11-27T16:44:00.000Z	geoffj	labanux	Well come and ask here in thoses cases :)
2004-11-27T16:50:00.000Z	geoffj	labanux	do you that it does not power off automatically?
2004-11-27T16:51:00.000Z	geoffj	labanux	maybe you need to enable something in your BIOS?
