2012-07-14T16:49:00.000Z	mankoff		Hi. Brand-new clean Ubuntu 12.04 install. How do I get 'nvidia-detector' to return something other than 'none'?
2012-07-14T16:49:00.000Z	mankoff		computer has GT-650M card...
2012-07-14T16:51:00.000Z	BluesKaj	mankoff	have you checked out restricted drivers ?
2012-07-14T16:51:00.000Z	mankoff	BluesKaj	how do I do that?
2012-07-14T16:51:00.000Z	mankoff	BluesKaj	I've seen mention of Bumblebee, etc. Is that what you refer to?
2012-07-14T16:55:00.000Z	BluesKaj	mankoff	bumblebee is for laptops that use 2 levels of graphics that uses 2 different graphics chips and drivers, is that your setup?
2012-07-14T16:56:00.000Z	mankoff	BluesKaj	I'm not sure. I have purchased a laptop *specifically* for CUDA work I need to do, but am having trouble getting it set up...
2012-07-14T17:01:00.000Z	BluesKaj	mankoff	look for additional drivers , dunno which desktop you're using so...
2012-07-14T17:31:00.000Z	BluesKaj	mankoff	did you locate the additional drivers ?
2012-07-14T17:32:00.000Z	BluesKaj	mankoff	yes
2012-07-14T17:32:00.000Z	mankoff	BluesKaj	I'll try those now...
2012-07-14T17:33:00.000Z	mankoff	BluesKaj	It says "No proprietary drivers are in use on this system" and I can't do anything other than "Close".
2012-07-14T17:33:00.000Z	BluesKaj	mankoff	so it's already installed if you followed that CUDA tutorial
2012-07-14T17:35:00.000Z	mankoff	BluesKaj	which tutorial? The only Mattias linked doesn't work on 12.04 Do you mean the bumblebee tutorial?
2012-07-14T17:37:00.000Z	BluesKaj	mankoff	your laptop doesn't need bumblebee
2012-07-14T17:48:00.000Z	BluesKaj	mankoff	your graphics card will run perfectly fine on 12.04 with the right driver ...this cuda app is merely an enhancement. You should really just get the proper graphics driver first , then if you want more fancy stuff run the cuda thing
2012-07-14T17:49:00.000Z	mankoff	BluesKaj	OK, how do I get the right driver? I'm not sure about even that... :( But I *need* CUDA for a specific app I want to run.
2012-07-14T17:51:00.000Z	BluesKaj	mankoff	oh ok , then I'll stop interfering ..didn't realize that  ,my apologies
