2007-03-09T16:34:00.000Z	Ademan	riaal	the loading screen stuff? that should be usplash
2007-03-09T16:35:00.000Z	riaal	Ademan	yeh, but how to change the resolutuin?
2007-03-09T16:35:00.000Z	Ademan	riaal	search for usplash on your system there should be a file like usplash.conf or something, it might be tucked away somewhere
2007-03-09T16:36:00.000Z	Ademan	riaal	and you'll have to update usplash afterwards, forgot the command though
2007-03-09T16:37:00.000Z	riaal	Ademan	found it, thanks
2007-03-09T16:37:00.000Z	Ademan	riaal	after you change it you'll have to update usplash with some command, lemme see if i can dig it up
2007-03-09T16:37:00.000Z	riaal	Ademan	oh... thanks
2007-03-09T16:37:00.000Z	Ademan	riaal	ah yes initramfs
2007-03-09T16:38:00.000Z	riaal	Ademan	cheers
2007-03-09T16:38:00.000Z	Ademan	riaal	not quite, i think it needs some options :-) don't you just love how complicated some things are?
2007-03-09T16:39:00.000Z	riaal	Ademan	I really do =) spent 8h trying to get my wireless to work yesterday ;)
2007-03-09T16:39:00.000Z	riaal	Ademan	foud it, sudo update-initramfs -u
2007-03-09T16:39:00.000Z	Ademan	riaal	terrible, wireless is hit or miss on linux, i've dealt with 4 boxes i didn't have to do ANYTHING to, they just worked out of the box, but i always hear about people who can't get it to work no matte what, etc
2007-03-09T16:40:00.000Z	Ademan	riaal	nice, you beat me haha
2007-03-09T16:41:00.000Z	riaal	Ademan	=) well the really stupid thing is my works, some times =) for exaple I can run kismet and scan whit it but I can't connect to my own whit the regular "network-admin" :S
