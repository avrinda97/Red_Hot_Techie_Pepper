2008-01-23T10:32:00.000Z	Robdgreat	nickrud	Palintheus was assisting me. I'm the one with the issue. trying that command
2008-01-23T10:34:00.000Z	Robdgreat	nickrud	all 3 are installed
2008-01-23T10:34:00.000Z	nickrud	Robdgreat	hm.  and when you ran   sudo update-alternatives --config java   you made sure that the sun was selected?
2008-01-23T10:35:00.000Z	Robdgreat		right. 6
2008-01-23T10:35:00.000Z	nickrud	Robdgreat	have you installed any other java plugins?
2008-01-23T10:36:00.000Z	Robdgreat	nickrud	yeah, got gij, icedtea, 1.4, and 6 :|
2008-01-23T10:38:00.000Z	nickrud	Robdgreat	ls  /usr/lib/firefox/plugins , do you see an obvious java plugin listed?
2008-01-23T10:39:00.000Z	Robdgreat	nickrud	libjavaplugin.so
2008-01-23T10:39:00.000Z	nickrud	Robdgreat	ok, ls -l /usr/lib/firefox/plugin/libjavaplugin.so , that will show you what it is linked to
2008-01-23T10:40:00.000Z	Robdgreat	nickrud	/etc/alternatives/firefox-javaplugin.so
2008-01-23T10:40:00.000Z	nickrud	Robdgreat	now ls -l /etc/alternatives/firefox-javaplugin.so , what does that link to?
2008-01-23T10:41:00.000Z	Robdgreat	nickrud	amazing. /usr/lib/gcj-4.2/libgcjwebplugin.so looks like the problem
2008-01-23T10:42:00.000Z	nickrud	Robdgreat	yes. That link should have been altered by the update-alternative.  try   sudo update-alternatives --config firefox-javaplugin.so
2008-01-23T10:43:00.000Z	Robdgreat	nickrud	That did it. Thanks a ton!
