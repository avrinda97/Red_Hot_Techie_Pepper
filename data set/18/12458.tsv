2006-04-18T08:08:00.000Z	RightSaidTed		hey guys I'm having some wicked dual boot problems- i have 2 hard drives and i installed ubuntu on one of them, winxp is on the other.
2006-04-18T08:09:00.000Z	DBO	RightSaidTed	be more specific please
2006-04-18T08:09:00.000Z	RightSaidTed		everything was fine, i logged into win xp once
2006-04-18T08:09:00.000Z	RightSaidTed		and now i try to go to ubuntu and it dies quickly
2006-04-18T08:09:00.000Z	DBO	RightSaidTed	what do you mean by it "dies"
2006-04-18T08:10:00.000Z	RightSaidTed		"mount: Mounting /dev/hda1 on /root failed: Invalid argument.  mount: mounting /root/dev on /dev/static/dev failed: No such file or directory"
2006-04-18T08:10:00.000Z	RightSaidTed		and i get kicked out to this funky shell with only a few commands, and being a newb i'm confused.
2006-04-18T08:10:00.000Z	RightSaidTed		google searches seemed to make it look like it may just be the wrong commands- i only ran xp from a grub command line, not the actual grub menu.
2006-04-18T08:11:00.000Z	DBO	RightSaidTed	had ubuntu ever booted correctly?
2006-04-18T08:11:00.000Z	RightSaidTed		so i thought maybe i screwed up something when i said map (hd0) (hd1) and then after map (hd1) (hd0) to boot xp
2006-04-18T08:11:00.000Z	RightSaidTed	DBO	yes, quite a few times
2006-04-18T08:11:00.000Z	RightSaidTed		i just hadn't done any xp stuff yet
2006-04-18T08:12:00.000Z	DBO	RightSaidTed	odd... do you run any programs on windows that might have effected your linux disks?
2006-04-18T08:12:00.000Z	RightSaidTed		DBO- no I don't think so
2006-04-18T08:13:00.000Z	RightSaidTed		they are 2 different physical drives.
2006-04-18T08:13:00.000Z	RightSaidTed		is there anything i can do from this goofy busybox built in shell to figure out what drives have what?
2006-04-18T08:13:00.000Z	DBO	RightSaidTed	you need someone more awake than me... sorry I figured this would be a standard run of the mill problem, but you found yourself a genuine issue
2006-04-18T08:14:00.000Z	RightSaidTed	DBO	thanks, yeah.
