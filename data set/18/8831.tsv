2007-08-07T12:58:00.000Z	bannerman		Does Ubuntu support booting from software raid?
2007-08-07T12:58:00.000Z	bannerman		using 7.04
2007-08-07T12:58:00.000Z	level1	bannerman	I'm trying the same thing
2007-08-07T12:58:00.000Z	bannerman	level1	my condolences.
2007-08-07T12:58:00.000Z	level1	bannerman	only on raid 1 and 0
2007-08-07T12:58:00.000Z	bannerman	level1	thank you, you are my favorite expert
2007-08-07T12:58:00.000Z	level1	bannerman	yeah, its hard, but its doable
2007-08-07T12:59:00.000Z	level1	bannerman	you best bet is to put /boot on a seperate partition.  Raid it if you want to, raid 1 is a good choice because then its still bootable if it breaks
2007-08-07T12:59:00.000Z	level1	bannerman	the put / on maybe raid 1 or raid 0+1, then /home on whatever you want.  Don't raid swap
2007-08-07T13:38:00.000Z	bannerman	level1	is there a particular reason not to raid swap? I'm a bigger fan of uptime than performance.
2007-08-07T13:39:00.000Z	level1	bannerman	well, you can simulate it using fstab
2007-08-07T13:39:00.000Z	level1	bannerman	see, if you create multiple swap pratitions over multiple hard drives and write them all into fstab in the same way, the kernel will raid 0 over all of them
2007-08-07T13:40:00.000Z	bannerman	level1	yeah, but raid 0 basically means if any disk crashes, my uptime is gone
2007-08-07T13:41:00.000Z	bannerman	level1	I'd rather run raid 1
2007-08-07T13:41:00.000Z	level1	bannerman	well, I don't know.  My computer never, ever swaps, so I only need it for hibernating
2007-08-07T13:42:00.000Z	level1	bannerman	but I guess you can do raid 1 swap if your really that concerned... but the kernel stuff shouldn't be swapped, so I wouldn't think that even a hard disk crash would break it
2007-08-07T13:42:00.000Z	level1	bannerman	why do you need super uptime?  are you running a server?
2007-08-07T13:42:00.000Z	bannerman	level1	yes.
