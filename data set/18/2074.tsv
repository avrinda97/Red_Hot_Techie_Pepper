2011-11-04T12:13:00.000Z	Adriannom		hi.  how do i disable escape sequences on the console?  that is, i just want a regular escape key
2011-11-04T12:13:00.000Z	theadmin	Adriannom	umm, I don't think you can
2011-11-04T12:14:00.000Z	Adriannom	theadmin	oh... :s
2011-11-04T12:15:00.000Z	Adriannom	theadmin	that's...  stupid...
2011-11-04T12:15:00.000Z	theadmin	Adriannom	What exactly is? The keycode the escape key produces is the only thing it can do, anyway
2011-11-04T12:16:00.000Z	Adriannom	theadmin	sure, but it's the terminal that's choosing what to do with it right?
2011-11-04T12:16:00.000Z	theadmin	Adriannom	It's the app running in it.
2011-11-04T12:16:00.000Z	theadmin	Adriannom	Say, less would interpret that keycode as "exit"
2011-11-04T12:16:00.000Z	Adriannom	theadmin	nah the app wants a basic escape
2011-11-04T12:17:00.000Z	theadmin	Adriannom	What is a basic escape, anyway, in your opinion?
2011-11-04T12:17:00.000Z	Adriannom	theadmin	i only just found out about escape sequences, so i want an escape key where they don't exist ;)
2011-11-04T12:18:00.000Z	Adriannom	theadmin	so that i can use an app that binds something to the escape key, something used a lot
2011-11-04T12:18:00.000Z	theadmin	Adriannom	Ah, well... hm...
2011-11-04T12:19:00.000Z	theadmin	Adriannom	You can try killing the escape key whatsoever and then binding...
2011-11-04T12:19:00.000Z	Adriannom	theadmin	sounds good, any idea where i can start?
2011-11-04T12:19:00.000Z	theadmin	Adriannom	Well, I think the idea is something like: xmodmap -e 'keysym esc=', not sure what's the proper name for the escape key though
2012-02-09T18:46:00.000Z	theadmin	Adriannom	Install Xubuntu, Lubuntu or Kubuntu.
2012-02-09T18:52:00.000Z	theadmin	Adriannom	Correct.
