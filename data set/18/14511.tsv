2006-11-08T12:35:00.000Z	gyaresu	kuzmaster	Well worth using.
2006-11-08T12:35:00.000Z	gyaresu	kuzmaster	cables? wireless?
2006-11-08T12:36:00.000Z	gyaresu	kuzmaster	which chip. please be specific.
2006-11-08T12:37:00.000Z	gyaresu	kuzmaster	rt2500?
2006-11-08T12:47:00.000Z	gyaresu	kuzmaster	is it installed? If so then from the command line.
2006-11-08T12:48:00.000Z	gyaresu	kuzmaster	First you need to know the command. I imagine it will be kwifimanager but you can type 'apropos kwifi' and that should return the progs name.
2006-11-08T12:48:00.000Z	gyaresu	kuzmaster	From a terminal yes?
2006-11-08T12:48:00.000Z	gyaresu	kuzmaster	no probs.
2006-11-08T12:49:00.000Z	gyaresu	kuzmaster	hmmm?
2006-11-08T12:50:00.000Z	gyaresu	kuzmaster	If you are having problems... then, yes.
2006-11-08T12:51:00.000Z	gyaresu	kuzmaster	I can tell you how to do things with command line. I don't use kwifi so maybe someone else can help there.
2006-11-08T12:52:00.000Z	gyaresu	kuzmaster	there you shall find them.
2006-11-08T12:52:00.000Z	gyaresu	kuzmaster	sorry. right. wireless...
