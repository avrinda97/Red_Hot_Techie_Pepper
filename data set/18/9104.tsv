2008-07-19T05:00:00.000Z	super-6-1		 td123 my laptop wont go above 800x600 res and when im on 7.04 it can
2008-07-19T05:02:00.000Z	super-6-1		Well, here a better question. Can i add resolutions to ubuntu 8.04
2008-07-19T05:03:00.000Z	Jordan_U	super-6-1	Yes, most likely your problem with not having the correct resolution is a driver issue though
2008-07-19T05:04:00.000Z	super-6-1	Jordan_U	I have a intell
2008-07-19T05:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	super-6-1	Can you pastebin your /etc/X11/xorg.conf ?
2008-07-19T05:05:00.000Z	super-6-1	Jordan_U	im not on ubuntu, havn't installed it yet.
2008-07-19T05:06:00.000Z	Jordan_U	super-6-1	So you were just having a problem getting the correct resolution on the LiveCD?
2008-07-19T05:07:00.000Z	super-6-1	Jordan_U	no, I have installed it before, i could never get it above the 800x600 res,
2008-07-19T05:07:00.000Z	Jordan_U	super-6-1	What version of Ubuntu ?
2008-07-19T05:07:00.000Z	super-6-1	Jordan_U	8.04
2008-07-19T05:07:00.000Z	super-6-1	Jordan_U	7.04 works perfectly
2008-07-19T05:11:00.000Z	super-6-1	Jordan_U	let me install ubuntu ok?
2008-07-19T05:11:00.000Z	Jordan_U	super-6-1	Odd, perhaps try your 7.04 xorg.conf in 8.10, did you check if 8.04 was using the "intel" driver, if not then changing the driver from "vesa" to "intel" in your xorg.conf should do the trick, like you were asking before, also as you were asking, you can manually specify a resolution in your xorg.conf but that should not be necessary
2008-07-19T05:12:00.000Z	Jordan_U	super-6-1	OK, I can also just as easily help from the LiveCD so you don't have to commit if you can't get it working
2008-07-19T05:12:00.000Z	super-6-1	Jordan_U	alright. give me a hour be back on
2008-07-19T05:13:00.000Z	Jordan_U	super-6-1	OK, I may or may not be here
2008-07-19T05:13:00.000Z	super-6-1	Jordan_U	okey.
