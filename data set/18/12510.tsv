2007-01-10T16:14:00.000Z	Bips		after upgrading to kernel 2.6.19 my IDE devices are detected as /dev/sdx. how can i make the kernel recognise it as /dev/hdx?
2007-01-10T16:15:00.000Z	mwe	Bips	how did you upgrade? what you describe sound very unusual
2007-01-10T16:16:00.000Z	Bips	mwe	i recompiled the latest kernel using the config of 2.6.18.. am i missing some thing?
2007-01-10T16:16:00.000Z	mwe	Bips	It sounds like a misconfigured kernel
2007-01-10T16:17:00.000Z	mwe	Bips	did you 'make oldconfig'?
2007-01-10T16:18:00.000Z	Bips	mwe	no
2007-01-10T16:18:00.000Z	mwe	Bips	what exactly did you do?
2007-01-10T16:20:00.000Z	Bips	mwe	as i told you before i used the config of previous version and made few more changes for the latest ie. added few stat drivers
2007-01-10T16:20:00.000Z	mwe	Bips	you didn't tell me how you did it
2007-01-10T16:20:00.000Z	mwe	Bips	did you just copy the .config then make?
2007-01-10T16:21:00.000Z	Bips	mwe	exactly
2007-01-10T16:22:00.000Z	mwe	Bips	go over make menuconfig again. I'm sure something is missing/misconfigured
2007-01-10T16:22:00.000Z	mwe	Bips	what kind of hdd is it? pata/sata?
2007-01-10T16:23:00.000Z	Bips	mwe	is an pata hdd
2007-01-10T16:24:00.000Z	mwe	Bips	then something is certainly misconfigured/missing or not loaded
2007-01-10T16:26:00.000Z	Bips	mwe	i've read somewhere that few ide drivers have been upgraded which creates this problem. is there any way to use the old ide drivers?
2007-01-10T16:26:00.000Z	mwe	Bips	hmm. you probably need to revert that particular patch then. might be hard to locate
2007-01-10T16:27:00.000Z	mwe	Bips	where did you read it? it sounds like a pretty bad bug to me
