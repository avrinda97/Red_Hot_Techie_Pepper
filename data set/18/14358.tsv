2005-11-28T13:05:00.000Z	darkheart		Anyone know why I can't view PHP files from localhost webserver? Web browser tries to download the file instead.
2005-11-28T13:06:00.000Z	JDahl	darkheart	have you installed the apache php library?
2005-11-28T13:06:00.000Z	darkheart	JDahl	Yeah, I believe so. What's the package called?
2005-11-28T13:07:00.000Z	JDahl	darkheart	probably libapache2-mod-php4
2005-11-28T13:09:00.000Z	darkheart	JDahl	Yeah, I have it installed but I use libapache2-mod-php5
2005-11-28T13:10:00.000Z	JDahl	darkheart	maybe script isnt exectutable or something simple like that?
2005-11-28T13:13:00.000Z	darkheart	JDahl	No, they don't need to be executable, only readable. The PHP engine parses the files when they are read.
2005-11-28T13:13:00.000Z	darkheart	JDahl	I had it working earlier, but then started f@**ing w/ it to get something else that wasn't working working. Suddenly I can't view the pages anymore. (Did a bunch of reinstalls).
2005-11-28T13:15:00.000Z	JDahl	darkheart	it always worked fine for me in the past also... I never had to do anything special
2005-11-28T13:16:00.000Z	darkheart	JDahl	It worked fine for me also on the first install, but despite having php-db installed, I couldn't use the MSSQL connection type in the PEAR DB class.
2005-11-28T13:16:00.000Z	darkheart	JDahl	So I tried installing/reinstalling packages and then suddenly it's broke.
2005-11-28T13:17:00.000Z	JDahl	darkheart	did you try restarting the webserver?
2005-11-28T13:17:00.000Z	darkheart	JDahl	Yeah, quite a few times ;)
2005-11-28T13:18:00.000Z	JDahl	darkheart	what does "cat /etc/mime.types | grep php" tell you?
2005-11-28T13:19:00.000Z	darkheart	JDahl	It's got the correct mime types in there
2005-11-28T13:20:00.000Z	darkheart	JDahl	application/x-httpd-php                         phtml pht php
2005-11-28T13:22:00.000Z	JDahl	darkheart	shouldnt you have something for php{3,4,5} in mime.types?
2005-11-28T13:24:00.000Z	darkheart	JDahl	There is nothing for 5, but there are types for 3 and 4.
