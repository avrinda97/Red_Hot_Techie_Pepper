2008-11-06T00:24:00.000Z	dwxreaper		i can't open synaptic says dpkg interrupted you must manually run 'dpkg --configure -a'
2008-11-06T00:24:00.000Z	dwxreaper		but i run that and it doesn't work??
2008-11-06T00:24:00.000Z	Slart	dwxreaper	have you done that?
2008-11-06T00:24:00.000Z	dwxreaper		it is doing something with db-common for another program i haven't touched in synatpic in forever..
2008-11-06T00:24:00.000Z	dwxreaper		slart: i typed that command yeah
2008-11-06T00:25:00.000Z	Slart	dwxreaper	and you got some kind of error? tried putting a sudo in front of it?
2008-11-06T00:26:00.000Z	dwxreaper		slart: i'm running as root
2008-11-06T00:26:00.000Z	dwxreaper		it says db-common flushing administrator password for a program i haven't even worked with forever
2008-11-06T00:26:00.000Z	dwxreaper		then just ahngs
2008-11-06T00:27:00.000Z	Slart	dwxreaper	well... I guess you'll have to check the manual for this mysterious program
2008-11-06T00:27:00.000Z	dwxreaper	Slart	it's cacti a lot of people use it
2008-11-06T00:28:00.000Z	dwxreaper		it's been running forever, and still is
2008-11-06T00:28:00.000Z	dwxreaper		then when i went to install something else through synaptic there is a problem
2008-11-06T00:28:00.000Z	Slart	dwxreaper	you could always try uninstalling cacti
2008-11-06T00:29:00.000Z	dwxreaper		slart: i could would not be good though, there is a big configuration file and rrd databases
2008-11-06T00:29:00.000Z	dwxreaper		slart: i can't tell it to ignore cacti
2008-11-06T00:29:00.000Z	dwxreaper		why is it even messing with that
2008-11-06T00:30:00.000Z	Slart	dwxreaper	it might have been some kind of update.. not sure if you can just tell it to ignore one package.. Apt is a big program full of features, wouldn't surprise me if there was a way
