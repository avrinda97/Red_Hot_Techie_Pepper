2010-05-01T08:24:00.000Z	acicula	progre55	well depends on the kind of noise i guess
2011-06-27T16:55:00.000Z	acicula	progre55	should there be?
2011-06-27T16:56:00.000Z	acicula	progre55	also what nvidia card do you have, and is this a headless installation ?
2011-06-27T16:56:00.000Z	progre55	acicula	I'm not sure, but I cant get python-pyopencl working. I get "clGetPlatformIDs failed: invalid/unknown error code"
2011-06-27T16:56:00.000Z	progre55	acicula	gtx 275
2011-06-27T16:57:00.000Z	acicula	progre55	is X running?
2011-06-27T16:57:00.000Z	progre55	acicula	umm.. no x, as it's on a server =)
2011-06-27T16:58:00.000Z	progre55	acicula	wanted to set it up for bitcoin mining
2011-06-27T16:59:00.000Z	progre55	acicula	thats what I get from lsmod "nvidia              10220950  0"
2011-06-27T16:59:00.000Z	acicula	progre55	i guess it is loaded
2011-06-27T17:02:00.000Z	acicula	progre55	not really sure why your opencl tool fails, but it seems you have the driver module loaded
2011-06-27T17:02:00.000Z	progre55	acicula	I probably need to export the LD_LIBRARY_PATH var
2011-06-27T17:03:00.000Z	acicula	progre55	are you running the script as root?
2011-06-27T17:04:00.000Z	progre55	acicula	not really.. let me try running it as root..
2011-06-27T17:09:00.000Z	progre55	acicula	even using root I get "pyopencl.LogicError: clGetPlatformIDs failed: invalid/unknown error code"
2011-06-27T17:10:00.000Z	acicula	progre55	dunno then, try the nvidia cude/opencl sdk and compile the samples
2011-06-27T17:10:00.000Z	progre55	acicula	thanks man, appreciate
