2009-01-22T00:25:00.000Z	_Vi_		36GiB of .pdfs??!!? what did you do down load the entire Wikipedia?
2009-01-22T00:25:00.000Z	Slart	_Vi_	it's a year worth of a local newspaper
2009-01-22T00:26:00.000Z	Slart	_Vi_	the cheap <bad people> don't want to put up an archive of old newspapers.. but they make todays paper available on their website.. say hello to mr wget and mr cron =)
2009-01-22T00:27:00.000Z	Slart	_Vi_	hehe.. I've got the room to spare =)
2009-01-22T00:27:00.000Z	_Vi_	Slart	yeah my newspaper is the same way, that's a good idea actually
2009-01-22T00:28:00.000Z	_Vi_	Slart	how exactly do you do wget to make it a .pdf though? could you PM me on how?
2009-01-22T00:28:00.000Z	Slart	_Vi_	they offer a pdf for download.. I just download them
2009-01-22T00:29:00.000Z	Slart	_Vi_	but I guess you could use firefox and a pdf-printer .. it wouldn't be as pretty.. but it would work I guess
2009-01-22T00:29:00.000Z	_Vi_	Slart	ill check and see if they offer pdf, thanks :)
2009-01-22T01:40:00.000Z	Slart	_Vi_	"most" is kind of nice too
2009-01-24T03:52:00.000Z	Slart	_Vi_	you can always use the !no, backup is bla bla bla better links bla bla bla command to suggest a change to a factoid
2009-01-24T03:52:00.000Z	_Vi_	Slart	all the links for "GUI backup apps" on that site are broke
2009-01-24T03:52:00.000Z	_Vi_	Slart	Ive done that before they never get approved
2009-01-24T03:54:00.000Z	_Vi_	Slart	two weeks ago i suggested a change for !tab because !tab DOES NOT tell anyone exacty how to use it, it just says it's availble blah blah, so im not updating anymore factoids </rant>
2009-01-24T03:54:00.000Z	Slart	_Vi_	hmm.. you can always talk to the bot-guy.. I think there is a channel for the bots to play in.. he usually pops by there every now and then
2009-01-24T04:27:00.000Z	Slart	_Vi_	haven't seen one.. I forget what I use.. it's been running the last 2 years without any problems..sbackup perhaps
2009-01-24T04:27:00.000Z	_Vi_	Slart	ok ty ill try that
2009-01-24T04:56:00.000Z	_Vi_	Slart	that sbackup program is great! Thanks again :)
