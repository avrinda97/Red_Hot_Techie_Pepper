2010-12-31T04:23:00.000Z	GeekSquid	KM0201	just different options of doing the same thing
2011-01-01T00:57:00.000Z	KM0201	GeekSquid	it's amazing people still need to be told that.
2011-01-01T00:58:00.000Z	GeekSquid	KM0201	tee hee
2011-01-01T01:05:00.000Z	GeekSquid	KM0201	occasionally a wireless card will show up as an eth1
2011-01-01T01:05:00.000Z	KM0201	GeekSquid	really?.. never saw that one
2011-01-01T01:06:00.000Z	GeekSquid	KM0201	kinda surprised me too, but it does happen with some models
2011-01-01T01:07:00.000Z	GeekSquid	KM0201	plc90210: I'd like to see a pastebin of what you've got in ifconfig, but if you have no net on the machine that would be difficult
2011-01-01T01:07:00.000Z	KM0201	GeekSquid	yeah.. forgot about that
2011-01-01T02:54:00.000Z	KM0201	GeekSquid	it had to be a setting in plc90210's router... he couldn't remember the router password, so we reset it, and wen tthrough the settings one by one, set it u w/ WPA2, and it works fien now... but his wireless is still eth1, instead of wlan0... go figure
2011-01-02T00:03:00.000Z	GeekSquid	KM0201	is that all? I thought it was 84 gogoplexzillion
2011-01-02T00:03:00.000Z	KM0201	GeekSquid	maybe i was off by a couple 100 trillion, i dunno.. :)
2011-01-04T08:39:00.000Z	KM0201	GeekSquid	that will be long gone when he gets bcack..lol
2011-01-04T08:40:00.000Z	GeekSquid	KM0201	so I am copying it into the pvt msg that his script sent back to me if he isn't entirely gone

2011-01-05T08:25:00.000Z	KM0201	GeekSquid	you're a pretty smart feller
2011-01-05T08:26:00.000Z	GeekSquid	KM0201	are you talking good about me, now people are going to expect things from me
2011-01-05T08:26:00.000Z	KM0201	GeekSquid	hey, i never knew you could do that..lol
