2005-02-04T15:47:00.000Z	pvh		Does ubuntu ship with a repartitioning tool?
2005-02-04T15:48:00.000Z	pvh		what should i install then? i'd prefer something nice and graphical which installs into my "computer" menu
2005-02-04T15:50:00.000Z	pvh		i have already freed the space, in this case, but i would like a nice tool which can resize partitions and the like.
2005-02-04T15:50:00.000Z	Ng	pvh	as far as I know parted or qtparted are your only option, but there might be another one hiding in there somewhere ;)
2005-02-04T15:51:00.000Z	pvh	Ng	Thanks.
2005-02-04T15:53:00.000Z	pvh	Ng	Do I need to worry about umounting my hda here?
2005-02-04T15:54:00.000Z	Ng	pvh	you certainly don't want to be moving/resizing partitions that you have mounted
2005-02-04T15:57:00.000Z	Ng	pvh	to be fair, qtparted isn't in the main section of ubuntu, it's in universe, which means it's not officially an ubuntu supported package. I'm sure that in hoary or the one after they'll have a nice gparted interface with safe warnings and stuff
2005-02-04T15:57:00.000Z	pvh	Ng	It's no insult towards ubuntu.
2005-02-04T15:57:00.000Z	pvh	Ng	It's just an example of poor software engineering.
2005-02-04T15:58:00.000Z	pvh	Ng	One of the first laws of user interface design is don't let people walk off cliffs.
2005-02-04T15:58:00.000Z	pvh	Ng	Right?
2005-02-04T15:58:00.000Z	Ng	pvh	indeed
2005-02-04T15:58:00.000Z	pvh	Ng	By the way, your alias rocks YT's world.
2005-02-04T15:58:00.000Z	Ng	pvh	nice :D
2005-02-04T15:58:00.000Z	pvh	Ng	Good idea. I'm on it.
2005-02-04T15:58:00.000Z	Ng	pvh	not many people get the reference ;)
2005-02-04T16:07:00.000Z	Ng	pvh	it's not almost impossible to figure out when you have lots of friendly IRC channels and forums and mailing lists :)
