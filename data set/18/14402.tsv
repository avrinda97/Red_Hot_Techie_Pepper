2005-08-21T13:18:00.000Z	shammy		 I'm trying to install phoenix, and i installed the rpm with alien but when i try to run it i get: phoenix: error while loading shared libraries: libpng.so.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory, but i've already ran the command apt-get install apt-file; apt-file update; apt-file search libpng.so.2. What can I do to get the file I need?
2005-08-21T13:20:00.000Z	LinuxJones	shammy	libpng2 is available for download but libpng3 may be removed if you install it
2005-08-21T13:21:00.000Z	shammy	LinuxJones	ok, I have libpng2 installed, but now it says phoenix: cannot connect to x server
2005-08-21T13:22:00.000Z	LinuxJones	shammy	what is phoenix ?
2005-08-21T13:23:00.000Z	shammy	LinuxJones	It's  Phoenix Object Basic, it's fully implemented BASIC with a simple GUI maker and some other good features
2005-08-21T13:24:00.000Z	LinuxJones	shammy	did you enable the root account on your ubuntu machine ?
2005-08-21T13:25:00.000Z	shammy	LinuxJones	no I haven't. I forget the command.. something like set root passwd?
2005-08-21T13:25:00.000Z	LinuxJones	shammy	yeah don't do that
2005-08-21T13:26:00.000Z	shammy	LinuxJones	oh, ok. any idea what I can do then?
2005-08-21T13:26:00.000Z	LinuxJones	shammy	oh man that's an odd problem for Ubuntu, can you >> sudo phoenix << to see if it works ?
2005-08-21T13:27:00.000Z	shammy	LinuxJones	same problem :/
2005-08-21T13:29:00.000Z	LinuxJones	shammy	sometimes you have problems when using alien to convert a .rpm .
2005-08-21T13:29:00.000Z	LinuxJones	shammy	python is already installed on your system :D
2005-08-21T13:30:00.000Z	shammy	LinuxJones	heh, but i don't know any python
2005-08-21T13:30:00.000Z	LinuxJones	shammy	apt-get install diveintopython (it's a great tutroial on getting started) basic on Linux will go nowhere when there are much better alternatives.
2005-08-21T13:31:00.000Z	shammy	LinuxJones	ok I'll try it. but do y ou know of any apps to easily build python GUI's?
2005-08-21T13:33:00.000Z	LinuxJones	shammy	boa-constructor is very promising it's using Borland's Delphi as a model for it's functionality (but is still fairly young as a project)
2005-08-21T13:33:00.000Z	LinuxJones	shammy	>> http://boa-constructor.sourceforge.net/Screenshots/   it's available in the universe repo for download already
