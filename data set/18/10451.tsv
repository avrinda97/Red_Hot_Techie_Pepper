2007-02-11T11:20:00.000Z	gottatrieit		My system is apparently corrupted. I cannot load Synaptic nor update manager. Please help.
2007-02-11T11:22:00.000Z	gottatrieit		I have the update icon showint in my sys tray, but I cannot connect. Why?
2007-02-11T11:23:00.000Z	Dr_willis	gottatrieit	 some of the servers are overloaded at this time.. may want ty try again later/tomorrow
2007-02-11T11:24:00.000Z	gottatrieit	Dr_willis	I have tried since yesterday, the screen doesn't open. Also, synaptic won't open. I had a quick power outage that I think may have fouled my system.
2007-02-11T11:25:00.000Z	Dr_willis	gottatrieit	 ugh. may want to boot a live cd. and fsck the drives to verify they are all 'ok'
2007-02-11T11:25:00.000Z	gottatrieit		I upgraded from Badger to Dapper over the internet, can I use the Badger cd to do this?
2007-02-11T11:26:00.000Z	Dr_willis	gottatrieit	 i dont even rember what the badgercd can do.. you really should track down a newer livecd.
2007-02-11T11:27:00.000Z	gottatrieit	Dr_willis	Can this be performed from terminal?
2007-02-11T11:27:00.000Z	gottatrieit	Dr_willis	fsck, I mean.
2007-02-11T11:28:00.000Z	Dr_willis	gottatrieit	 fscking from a system you booted from/with mounted filesystems. is not a good idea.  thus the need for a live cd.
2007-02-11T11:28:00.000Z	gottatrieit		ok, ty, Dr_willis.
2007-02-11T11:28:00.000Z	Dr_willis	gottatrieit	 i got a stack of little live cds i keep for just such an emergancy. I boot them, use fsck /dev/whatever as needed (rarely ever need to do this) but yours is a special case
2007-02-11T11:29:00.000Z	gottatrieit	Dr_willis	can I download a live cd from the internet or do I have to find an outside source to order/purchase one?
2007-02-11T11:30:00.000Z	Dr_willis	gottatrieit	 theres 100's of them you can download.
2007-02-11T11:30:00.000Z	Dr_willis	gottatrieit	 may want to check out 'slax' or 'puppylinux' or 'dsl'  live cd's
2007-02-11T11:30:00.000Z	Dr_willis	gottatrieit	 plus theres the official ubuntu live cd's
2007-02-11T11:31:00.000Z	gottatrieit		Ok. Thanks again. Live ubuntu cd's would be at the support sight someplace? Yes? (Only a newbie would ask, right? lol )
2007-02-11T11:34:00.000Z	gottatrieit	Dr_willis	Thanks again for your help. Have a good day. bye all
