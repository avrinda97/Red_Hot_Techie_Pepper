2010-06-30T23:56:00.000Z	LordNeo		if you need dinamic, set the command to run on startup
2010-06-30T23:57:00.000Z	LordNeo		How do i disable the Focus Steal Protection?
2010-06-30T23:57:00.000Z	ubuntujenkins	LordNeo	try systems -> Prefernces -> windows
2010-06-30T23:59:00.000Z	LordNeo	ubuntujenkins	already tried, and searched around too, but the only reports are with beryl or compiz enabled
2010-07-01T00:01:00.000Z	ubuntujenkins	LordNeo	does "enabling focus follow mouse" not work? I just diabled compiz and it did for me
2010-07-01T00:02:00.000Z	LordNeo	ubuntujenkins	enabling it only makes the windows get the focus once i pass the mouse over. If i have Firefox maximized and open up a terminal or whatsoever, it opens in foreground
2010-07-01T00:03:00.000Z	ubuntujenkins	LordNeo	so you want programs to open behind the one that is currently focused?
2010-07-01T00:04:00.000Z	LordNeo	ubuntujenkins	just the opposite, i like the new windows to get on top, but today that behaviour changed and now every new windows opens in foreground
2010-07-01T00:05:00.000Z	ubuntujenkins	LordNeo	I am lost i am afraid forefround = on top as far as i think
2010-07-01T00:06:00.000Z	LordNeo	ubuntujenkins	then i'm mistaking the concepts... i want the new windows to open on top, and today, it changed to "behind" the active window
2010-07-01T00:07:00.000Z	ubuntujenkins	LordNeo	that makes more sense, what updates did you do today?
2010-07-01T00:07:00.000Z	LordNeo	ubuntujenkins	daily updates, didn't remember so well, but it was only firefox and something else
2010-07-01T00:08:00.000Z	ubuntujenkins	LordNeo	have a look in synaptic package manager look in file -> history
2010-07-01T00:08:00.000Z	LordNeo	ubuntujenkins	xulrunner, flash plugin and firefox
2010-07-01T00:09:00.000Z	LordNeo	ubuntujenkins	i was doing that :P
2010-07-01T00:09:00.000Z	LordNeo	ubuntujenkins	only that and the purge of my old kernels
2010-07-01T00:10:00.000Z	ubuntujenkins	LordNeo	:) I don't know it appears strange none of those look like they would effect it
2010-07-01T00:10:00.000Z	LordNeo	ubuntujenkins	well, thanks for your time anyway, i will keep on looking about
