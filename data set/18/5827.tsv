2008-08-31T00:24:00.000Z	csa3d		any reason my none of my natilus folders seem to open
2008-08-31T00:24:00.000Z	bombshelter13	csa3d	probably yes.
2008-08-31T00:25:00.000Z	csa3d		bombshlter13:  awesome.. any idea where to start looking
2008-08-31T00:25:00.000Z	csa3d		;)
2008-08-31T00:25:00.000Z	bombshelter13	csa3d	unforunatetly I'm not so sure about that part ;)
2008-08-31T00:26:00.000Z	bombshelter13	csa3d	what is it doing instead of opening them?
2008-08-31T00:26:00.000Z	csa3d		also interesting, i have an update alert icon visible, and when I go "install all updates", enter my password, nothing seems to happen
2008-08-31T00:26:00.000Z	bombshelter13	csa3d	the more info you  can give about exactly how it's failing, the better chance we have of knowing what's wrong.
2008-08-31T00:26:00.000Z	csa3d	bombshelter13	 when i try to open one from the places menu, nothing hapens
2008-08-31T00:27:00.000Z	csa3d		it's almost as though the process dumped
2008-08-31T00:27:00.000Z	bombshelter13	csa3d	hmm, you specified local. Does it work for some ( I suppose remote ) locations?
2008-08-31T00:28:00.000Z	bombshelter13		scifiguy: ping everything in your subnet, or if you can be reasonably certain that everyone connected is using DHCP, check the DHCP leases on the router
2008-08-31T00:28:00.000Z	csa3d		i cannot open any nautilus windows currently
2008-08-31T00:29:00.000Z	bombshelter13	csa3d	try openning a terminal and launching nautilus from there, it might be more informative about why it is failing
2008-08-31T00:32:00.000Z	csa3d		ï»¿bombshelter13:that was it!  I got it from here.. bad env var
2008-08-31T00:32:00.000Z	bombshelter13	csa3d	hmm, curious
2008-08-31T00:33:00.000Z	csa3d	bombshelter13	 I had set a library path for a driver which was required for another app
2008-08-31T00:33:00.000Z	bombshelter13	csa3d	Ah, there you go. :)
