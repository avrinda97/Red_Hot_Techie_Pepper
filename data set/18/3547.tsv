2009-09-29T21:27:00.000Z	m2ky		Hi, all, can i set my ubuntubox to black/white style. from the base color, even when i visit a colored web site.I just want get a black/white in my eyes.
2009-09-29T21:28:00.000Z	grawity	m2ky	Install CCSM, look for 'Brightness/Contrast' plugin.
2009-09-29T21:33:00.000Z	m2ky	grawity	look, i use ubuntu as a program workstation, so what i need just a console interface, and a web browser that can show me some information from google. I use a old laptop which use the chrome IGP card, so it is seems that i cant open compiz on my laptop.
2009-09-29T21:33:00.000Z	grawity	m2ky	Console interface?
2009-09-29T21:34:00.000Z	grawity	m2ky	Try w3m, lynx, elinks, and so on.
2009-09-29T21:34:00.000Z	m2ky	grawity	yes, no x server.
2009-09-29T21:35:00.000Z	m2ky	grawity	the problem is that i can use the native resulotion 1680*1050 whitout X, and the three browser cant show me a picture.
2009-09-29T21:36:00.000Z	grawity	m2ky	There's a thing called "framebuffer". (Kernel modules vesafb, nvidiafb, and so on.)
2009-09-29T21:36:00.000Z	grawity	m2ky	It can use the native resolution, AND elinks (or links? don't remember) can use it to display pictures.
2009-09-29T21:38:00.000Z	m2ky	grawity	is that the vga=xxx in the grub boot line? i use a laptop use chrome IGP video card which is product at 2005, and many time, i plug my 22 lcd on the laptop, so what i can do?
2009-09-29T21:38:00.000Z	grawity	m2ky	vga=, yes, or modprobe vesafb, I think.
2009-09-29T21:39:00.000Z	grawity	m2ky	intelfb, if it's an Intel card (if that's what IGP means)
2009-09-29T21:40:00.000Z	m2ky	grawity	no, it is a card from s3. no very good driver support in linux world.
2009-09-29T21:40:00.000Z	grawity	m2ky	Well, framebuffer should still work fine.
2009-09-29T21:42:00.000Z	m2ky	grawity	i use the vga=ask parameter, and it gives me no wildscreen resolution. and not big enought.
2009-09-29T21:42:00.000Z	grawity	m2ky	Try 'sudo modprobe s3fb'
2009-09-29T21:42:00.000Z	grawity	m2ky	I really don't know what exactly does vga= do.
2009-09-29T21:43:00.000Z	m2ky	grawity	my friend's laptop which is use intel 915 chipset, and he put some x driver in the kernel as he said, and it support the big monitor.
