2008-06-15T00:47:00.000Z	xenomorph99		Unless I am root in Mandriva
2008-06-15T00:47:00.000Z	xenomorph99		But it prevents me
2008-06-15T00:48:00.000Z	xenomorph99		So, if I go and dump some files from Mandriva and Ubuntu can't access them, I can come back and ask the same question again?
2008-06-15T00:49:00.000Z	xenomorph99		OK, can I just explain how I use this partition?
2008-06-15T00:50:00.000Z	xenomorph99		I boot into Ubuntu. I don't have the partition set up in fstab. It's a FAT32 partition. I dump files onto it. I then later want to manipulate these files from Mandriva or Windows (or Ubuntu). I then boot into Windows. Windows doesn't give a monkeys about the permissions so I can do what I like. I then boot into Mandriva which I installed after Ubuntu. Without being root, I can't then delete files on that partition. It says I don
2008-06-15T00:51:00.000Z	xenomorph99		So FAT32 does support partitions now?
2008-06-15T00:51:00.000Z	xenomorph99		permissions, not partitions
2008-06-15T00:51:00.000Z	xenomorph99		OK, go ahead
2008-06-15T00:53:00.000Z	xenomorph99		OK. Now we've established that, I'll ask the question again
2008-06-15T00:54:00.000Z	xenomorph99		If the OS sets the permissions, how can I remove those permissions for those files OR tell the OS NOT to apply permissions to certain files ?
2008-06-15T00:55:00.000Z	ompaul	xenomorph99	if that creates issues for you I will be surprised if you want to use ext3 then you should have the same user:group and possibly UID set for both sides to be happy (I know this is needed for NFS but the uid might not need to be the same for fat)
2008-06-15T01:01:00.000Z	ompaul	xenomorph99	you are aware that if you don't umount the partitions correctly before you switch operating systems they (the partitions) are marked not clean and need fsck run on them
2008-06-15T01:03:00.000Z	ompaul	xenomorph99	try it, I imagine it will fail as chown will not work with nonexistant users
2008-06-15T01:04:00.000Z	ompaul	xenomorph99	you could however do this rwxrwxrwx on a directory below the mount point
2008-06-15T01:04:00.000Z	xenomorph99	ompaul	Yes, I suppose that would work, too
2008-06-15T01:16:00.000Z	ompaul	xenomorph99	^^ perhaps you would like to read that
2008-06-15T01:17:00.000Z	xenomorph99	ompaul	Read what? About clamav?
2008-06-15T01:17:00.000Z	ompaul	xenomorph99	no about however read this to understand why Linux does not have a virus problem: http://librenix.com/?inode=21
