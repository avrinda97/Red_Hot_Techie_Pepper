2007-10-10T11:54:00.000Z	lee__		oh how come we cant form mat or partion in NTFS in 7.04?  or did it eer have tht abillity and waht is ext3?
2007-10-10T11:55:00.000Z	GreySim	lee__	I think there's something you can install to enable NTFS support. ext3 is a Linux filesystem. Your main partition is going to have to be ext3 or another Linux-compatible type; you can't install Ubuntu onto an NTFS partition, since it doesn't support the features the Linux kernel needs, I believe.
2007-10-10T11:58:00.000Z	GreySim	lee__	I think it was just trying to import bookmarks, wallpaper, and a few other settings. I'm not sure though, as I've never used that feature.
2007-10-10T12:46:00.000Z	GreySim	lee__	Pitivi is an upcoming app for that, though last I heard it wasn't ready yet.
2007-10-10T12:48:00.000Z	GreySim	lee__	Like I said, it's not ready *yet*.
2007-10-10T12:48:00.000Z	GreySim	lee__	It just might be something to watch, and hopefully a good release happens in the near future.
2007-10-10T12:59:00.000Z	GreySim	lee__	You can add an applet to your panel to force kill misbehaving programs if it turns out to be a common problem. I generally don't have to use it, but sometimes when using third-party packages I've had to use it.
2007-10-10T13:04:00.000Z	GreySim	lee__	That is a problem. WINE can play *some* games. Cedega can play more, but costs money for the effective version. ($15 for it + three months of updates, last time I looked)
2007-10-10T13:05:00.000Z	GreySim	lee__	Personally, I keep a copy of Windows 2000 installed and dual boot for games, but I'm hoping I won't have to once WINE gets better.
2007-10-10T13:07:00.000Z	GreySim	lee__	It would also mean that her $300 wouldn't be invalidated. She'd still be using XP and the anti-virus software. Just not all the time.
2007-10-10T13:08:00.000Z	GreySim	lee__	No, Lindows was a Linux distribution. It's now called Linspire.
2007-10-10T13:09:00.000Z	GreySim	lee__	Same thing, basically. Freespire is just the free version of Linspire.
2007-10-10T13:13:00.000Z	GreySim	lee__	Yes, though I don't know how well it works.
2007-10-10T13:13:00.000Z	GreySim	lee__	Believe there are several, in fact.
