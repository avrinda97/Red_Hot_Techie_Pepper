2008-06-19T11:27:00.000Z	ZLemur		could be half a meg, but if i can't install from sd card, it's no good to me
2008-06-19T11:28:00.000Z	ZLemur		good poitn
2008-06-19T11:29:00.000Z	ZLemur		point, rather. perhaps i can wrangle up a used one some place
2008-06-19T11:29:00.000Z	ZLemur		sounds like a ton of  fun, actually
2008-06-19T11:30:00.000Z	ZLemur		good educational tool, too. can play with and get used tocommands without risking anything
2008-06-19T11:30:00.000Z	ZLemur		heres a stupid question:
2008-06-19T11:31:00.000Z	ZLemur		is it possible to eschew a gui to save resources except to use apps?
2008-06-19T11:31:00.000Z	ZLemur		like just use console to do everything that the apps don't.
2008-06-19T11:31:00.000Z	ZLemur		i imagine it's all tied together, but you never know.
2008-06-19T11:32:00.000Z	ZLemur		i don't meant to run it inside a terminal
2008-06-19T11:32:00.000Z	amirman84	ZLemur	you should look into fluxbox
2008-06-19T11:34:00.000Z	amirman84	ZLemur	gnome and kde both include a window manager and a desktop environment. fluxbox is just a window manager and can run on its own without a desktop environment which makes it super light that way
2008-06-19T11:35:00.000Z	amirman84	ZLemur	they actually have put together a FLUXbuntu
2008-06-19T11:36:00.000Z	amirman84	ZLemur	http://fluxbuntu.org/ here's fluxbuntu , more lightweight than even xubuntu
2008-06-19T11:38:00.000Z	amirman84	ZLemur	if you want a frugal install try the alternate install disc, it lets you choose which packages you want to install, the main install disc does not
2008-06-19T11:39:00.000Z	ZLemur	amirman84	- you mean for xandros that came with my eee?
2008-06-19T11:40:00.000Z	amirman84	ZLemur	i was talking about the alternate install disc for ubuntu
2008-06-19T11:45:00.000Z	amirman84	ZLemur	it's made to be as lightweight and functional as possible
