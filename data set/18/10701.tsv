2006-11-04T08:09:00.000Z	Farm_Fresh		Alright.... when I first installed ubuntu 6.06 in august... I needed to do the ndiswrapper work around to use the netgear wireless adapter.. And just this week after not liking Edgy, I did a clean install of Dapper after formatting the entire drive and today the wireless adapter worked right after installation.. ie out of box sort of..  How is this possible?
2006-11-04T08:10:00.000Z	Farm_Fresh		I didn't need to do anything..
2006-11-04T08:11:00.000Z	Vorbote	Farm_Fresh	If you used 6.06.1 the kernel is more recent.
2006-11-04T08:12:00.000Z	Farm_Fresh	Vorbote	 I'm not sure if it was 6.06.1 or not.. I know I burned the image mid september.
2006-11-04T08:13:00.000Z	Vorbote	Farm_Fresh	if you downloaded a new image then, it probably was 6.06.1
2006-11-04T08:14:00.000Z	Farm_Fresh	Vorbote	 Is there a place with release dates to check?
2006-11-04T08:15:00.000Z	Vorbote	Farm_Fresh	there is a changelog server, wait a sec...
2006-11-04T08:16:00.000Z	Vorbote	Farm_Fresh	here is the log for the latest dapper kernel:
2006-11-13T07:31:00.000Z	Vorbote	Farm_Fresh	uwin and irssi...
2006-11-13T07:32:00.000Z	Farm_Fresh	Vorbote	I have used irssi.. I like that.
2006-11-13T07:32:00.000Z	Farm_Fresh	Vorbote	Is that an option on XP?
2006-11-13T07:32:00.000Z	Vorbote	Farm_Fresh	You still need to compile it, but uwin is an excellent POSIX emulator (far better than Cygwin).
2006-11-13T07:33:00.000Z	Farm_Fresh	Vorbote	I've never compiled anything, or even know how to do it.
2006-11-13T07:33:00.000Z	Vorbote	Farm_Fresh	There is a first time for everything. Nobody is born knowing it all (although some graduates I've taught would seem so...).
2006-11-13T07:34:00.000Z	Farm_Fresh	Vorbote	 could you point me to a link with a walk through on how to do it?  I read about it everywhere... Guess that would be my next step in Linux.
2006-11-13T07:36:00.000Z	Vorbote	Farm_Fresh	give yourself a stroll through http://tldp.org You'll find lots of useful information there.
2006-11-13T07:38:00.000Z	Vorbote	Farm_Fresh	to exapand on what uwin is, it is a POXIX runtime created a ATT/Lucent to allow using Unix applications under Windows. You install uwin and get a basic Unix subsystem under windows. You can compile irssi and run it under the usin emulation.
2006-11-13T07:39:00.000Z	Farm_Fresh	Vorbote	 Oh.. hehe.. Well that sounds like it would take me the better part of a month to even figure out how to make that happen, let alone do it correctly.
