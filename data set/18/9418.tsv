2007-04-11T05:38:00.000Z	ubuntu_user07		How can I update GNOME on Ubuntu? I noticed its at 2.16 but on the site its 2.18?
2007-04-11T05:39:00.000Z	ubuntu_user07		Ah ok.
2007-04-11T05:40:00.000Z	ubuntu_user07		Can anyone help me install some taralls I am havign some troubles. Someone mentioned YaST to me but it doesn't seem to be on Ubuntu
2007-04-11T05:40:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntu_user07	what program are you looking to install
2007-04-11T05:48:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntu_user07	sudo apt-get install build-essential for c compiler
2007-04-11T05:50:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntu_user07	then you already have it "gcc" is the compiler
2007-04-11T05:50:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntu_user07	gcc
2007-04-13T07:35:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntu_user07	sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop
2007-04-13T07:35:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntu_user07	you will be able to remove it, yes
2007-05-02T08:40:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntu_user07	write a script to do it is what I ended up doing
2007-05-02T08:41:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntu_user07	well I wrote a script and the keyboard shorcutted it, the script would be something as simple as "rm ~/.recently-used"
2007-05-02T08:42:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntu_user07	the script should have two lines, line 1: #!/bin/bash    line 2: rm ~/.recently-used
2007-05-02T08:42:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntu_user07	save that in a file, then do "chmod +x thatfile"
2007-05-02T08:44:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntu_user07	whatever you want
2007-05-02T08:46:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntu_user07	well see if it works first off by doing "./whateveryounamedit"
2007-05-02T08:47:00.000Z	bruenig	ubuntu_user07	yeah, I would try to read up on bash scripting, understand the process a little bit more then you can not only write this script but any others which is nice
2007-05-02T08:51:00.000Z	ubuntu_user07	bruenig	when i am at the logon screen i see username-desktop in the bottom right corner is there a way to change that
