2006-12-29T10:05:00.000Z	Bradaphraser		desperately trying to figure out why it was killing itself
2006-12-29T10:06:00.000Z	Bradaphraser		256
2006-12-29T10:06:00.000Z	Bradaphraser		which was why I was trying to go for xubuntu
2006-12-29T10:06:00.000Z	Bradaphraser		ah yes
2006-12-29T10:07:00.000Z	Bradaphraser		that makes sense
2006-12-29T10:07:00.000Z	Bradaphraser		yeah
2006-12-29T10:07:00.000Z	Bradaphraser		so far
2006-12-29T10:07:00.000Z	Bradaphraser		you think it could be a problem with not enough RAM?
2006-12-29T10:07:00.000Z	Bradaphraser		and, if so, how could I fix that, outside of buying more RAM?
2006-12-29T10:08:00.000Z	Bradaphraser		it was working great three days ago
2006-12-29T10:08:00.000Z	robtp	Bradaphraser	whats your problem?
2006-12-29T10:09:00.000Z	robtp	Bradaphraser	at the same step, or after awhile?
2006-12-29T10:09:00.000Z	robtp	Bradaphraser	but not the same part?
2006-12-29T10:10:00.000Z	robtp	Bradaphraser	i have that problem all the time i switch between dvorak and qwerty it gets pretty weird
2006-12-29T10:10:00.000Z	robtp	Bradaphraser	it kinda sounds like a hardware issue but its hard to say without seeing it
2006-12-29T10:11:00.000Z	robtp	Bradaphraser	try doing a memory scan, look for memtest86 or its on the cd
2006-12-29T10:12:00.000Z	robtp	Bradaphraser	try using a ps2 mouse and keyboard if you can
2006-12-29T10:12:00.000Z	robtp	Bradaphraser	yeah
