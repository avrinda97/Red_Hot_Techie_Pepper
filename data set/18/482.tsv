2012-02-07T21:21:00.000Z	ldiamond		I have a ubuntu server setup with software raid1. Will I be warned in any way if a disk goes down? Will the machine stop working until the broken disk is replaced?
2012-02-07T21:22:00.000Z	Trevor69420	ldiamond	the point of RAID1 is to be an exact copy.. so no it wont go down
2012-02-07T21:24:00.000Z	ldiamond	Trevor69420	How will I be warned then?
2012-02-07T21:24:00.000Z	ldiamond	Trevor69420	it's not a raid card, it's software raid
2012-02-07T21:25:00.000Z	ldiamond	Trevor69420	raid cards beep and won't let you boot unless you override it

2012-02-07T21:25:00.000Z	Trevor69420	ldiamond	mine never beeps
2012-02-07T21:28:00.000Z	ldiamond	Trevor69420	ugh... that's odd. The system should just hang up at boot time and let you ssh in in order for you to acknowledge and either keep using it or power it down.
2012-02-07T21:30:00.000Z	Trevor69420	ldiamond	not sure why ur system isnt staying operational to be honest
2012-02-07T21:33:00.000Z	ldiamond	Trevor69420	oh I didn't say it wasn't operational. I personally don't want it to work if raid is degraded. That would be enough of a warning for me to figure it out and fix it before the 2nd drive fails
2012-02-07T21:34:00.000Z	Trevor69420	ldiamond	i suppose it depends on the situation my servers are mission critical so we dont want downtime
2012-02-07T21:35:00.000Z	ldiamond	Trevor69420	if you reboot a server anyways, you'd be expecting some downtime. Or maybe you're behind a load balancer and you can bounce them one by one. Always depends on the situation.
2012-02-07T21:36:00.000Z	Trevor69420	ldiamond	we never reboot so i dunno
2012-02-07T21:37:00.000Z	ldiamond	Trevor69420	if it's so mission critical, I really hope you're behind a load balancer and have redundancy.
2012-02-07T21:39:00.000Z	ldiamond	Trevor69420	I agree, but booting a degraded array should warn you somehow. Maybe require you to ssh
2012-02-07T21:40:00.000Z	ldiamond	Trevor69420	consider ZFS :p
2012-02-07T21:40:00.000Z	Trevor69420	ldiamond	well the raid card displays on the BIOS if the raid is degraded
2012-02-07T21:41:00.000Z	ldiamond	Trevor69420	it often sends email through the driver
