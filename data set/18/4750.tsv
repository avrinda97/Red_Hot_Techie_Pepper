2009-02-16T22:06:00.000Z	draccy		Hey there. I'm going through hell right now over what seems to be a serious bug with this dell laptop.
2009-02-16T22:07:00.000Z	draccy		The "fn" key is stuck enabled as soon as GNOME starts. I can't seem to untoggle it. It doesn't pose a problem at the GDM screen.
2009-02-16T22:07:00.000Z	draccy		This is a customer's laptop. I'm converting them to Ubuntu for a fee, and my job is basically at stake if I can't fix this.
2009-02-16T22:09:00.000Z	draccy		It is very hard to type while holding the fn key down with my pinky. right now half my keyboard is a number pad.
2009-02-16T22:10:00.000Z	n8tuser	draccy	-> what do you consider as your gdm screen?
2009-02-16T22:11:00.000Z	draccy	n8tuser	the login screen of course. GNOME takes priority inside of GDM from there on.
2009-02-16T22:14:00.000Z	n8tuser	draccy	-> when you do a  gconf-editor  and then drill down to /desktop/gnome/accessability/keyboard  can you read off your settings? what is checked?
2009-02-16T22:17:00.000Z	n8tuser	draccy	-> when you do a  gconf-editor  and then drill down to /desktop/gnome/accessability/keyboard  can you read off your settings? what is checked?
2009-02-16T22:19:00.000Z	draccy	n8tuser	can we dothis in PM?
2009-02-16T22:19:00.000Z	n8tuser	draccy	-> nope
2009-02-16T22:19:00.000Z	draccy	n8tuser	great...
2009-02-16T22:20:00.000Z	n8tuser	draccy	-> people can correct me if i mis-inform you
2009-02-16T22:20:00.000Z	draccy	n8tuser	It's hard to type with this keyboard the way it is. Are there any particular settings you're interested in? This is a default configuration.
2009-02-16T22:21:00.000Z	n8tuser	draccy	-> nothing in particular, more of comparing to mine, where function keys are okay
2009-02-16T22:22:00.000Z	draccy	n8tuser	seeing as fn keys tend to be a hardware feature and there seems to be no relevant setting in this set, I don't think it'll help... The only non-beep thing is "stickykeys_two_key_off"
2009-02-16T22:22:00.000Z	n8tuser	draccy	-> you can run  xwininfo  and get the id, then   xwd -id 0xyyyyyy > saveimage  then post saveimage in pastebin or somewhere an image can be posted
2009-02-16T22:23:00.000Z	draccy	n8tuser	or gnome-screenshot. :P
2009-02-16T22:23:00.000Z	n8tuser	draccy	-> well, if you already have determined that, then am of no help then
