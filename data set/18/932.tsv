2011-07-27T15:53:00.000Z	chenthu	nit-wit	yeah i did....i never worked....Live usb though
2011-07-27T15:54:00.000Z	nit-wit	chenthu	how did you try the low graphic?
2011-07-27T15:56:00.000Z	chenthu	nit-wit	any idea?
2011-07-27T15:56:00.000Z	nit-wit	chenthu	Did you use the f6 prompt with the live cd to choose nomodeset?
2011-07-27T15:57:00.000Z	chenthu	nit-wit	:yeah i tried that
2011-07-27T15:58:00.000Z	chenthu	nit-wit	using alternate download and complex installing method i installed 11.04 but now i get 4 errors and a black screen after login
2011-07-27T15:59:00.000Z	chenthu	nit-wit	do u know how to scan network  through a wireless card using terminal?
2011-07-27T16:00:00.000Z	nit-wit	chenthu	Ah at the bootscreen hit e for edit and replace aat the end of the first kernel wher it say no splash put in nomodeset and hit crtl_-x to boot then if in look at this link. http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1745940
2011-07-27T16:04:00.000Z	nit-wit	chenthu	does the adding nomodeset to the kernel make sense, you need a low graphic bot to install the correct driver as in the link.
2011-07-27T16:06:00.000Z	chenthu	nit-wit	yeah i got the link just rebooting to do that...i was actually working on a command line solution...but now that you have given me the link for the exact problem...i am trying that...thank you very much ....will post the result
2011-07-27T16:07:00.000Z	nit-wit	chenthu	the key with the nvidia card is the nomodeset to be run on the install than the first boot to get you in. ;)   no prblem for the help.
2011-07-27T16:08:00.000Z	chenthu	nit-wit	u mean i have to use the option while installing?...and not while booting after install?
2011-07-27T16:10:00.000Z	nit-wit	chenthu	as dr_willls confirmed at times nomodeset is run at install and the first bbot in.
