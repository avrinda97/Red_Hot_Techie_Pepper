2011-04-09T23:52:00.000Z	j5		after switching to Firefox 4 on ubuntu, my flash has all sorts of missing chunks, white blocks, and buggy interactivity-- anyone know a solution to this?
2011-04-09T23:53:00.000Z	ohsix	j5	on x86_64 with nspluginwrapper & 32bit plugin?
2011-04-09T23:53:00.000Z	j5	ohsix	yeah i think so
2011-04-09T23:54:00.000Z	ohsix	j5	i've had problems like that with nspluginwrapper and flash, even before ff4, is it differently bad on different websites? it doesn't support wmode with nspluginwrapper
2011-04-09T23:54:00.000Z	j5	ohsix	yeah.. its fine on some websites-- and google chromes flash is almost flawless
2011-04-09T23:55:00.000Z	j5	ohsix	im not sure if i have the 32bit plugin, i have Adobe Flash Player plugin for mozilla, which may or may not be that
2011-04-09T23:55:00.000Z	ohsix	j5	all i can really suggest is the native plugin, nspluginwrapper has never really worked acceptably for me
2011-04-09T23:56:00.000Z	ohsix	j5	if you have an x86_64 install and used flashplugin-installer (the package) instead of manually doing it, you have nspluginwrapper
2011-04-09T23:57:00.000Z	ohsix	j5	after you put native in the right place, or even before, be sure to uninstall flashplugin-installer (and nspluginwrapper and stuff should automatically go with it)
2011-04-10T00:09:00.000Z	j5	ohsix	im on 64bit ubuntu, do you know which flash package i should get? is it a adobe labs file?
2011-04-10T00:09:00.000Z	ohsix	j5	"Square" i believe, is still the 64bit one

2011-04-10T00:12:00.000Z	ohsix	j5	well you can do it in nautilus too, it needs to go into ~/.mozilla/plugins for per user install; theres a place to do it for the whole system but i haven't had the need to look
2011-04-10T00:13:00.000Z	ohsix	j5	looks like it's /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins
2011-04-10T00:15:00.000Z	j5	ohsix	thanks got that installed ill test it out :)
2011-04-10T00:18:00.000Z	j5	ohsix	wow i think that fixed everything
2011-04-10T00:18:00.000Z	ohsix	j5	nice
2011-04-10T00:18:00.000Z	ohsix	j5	it'll be faster and wmode will work too ;]
