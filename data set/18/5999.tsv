2008-07-16T04:39:00.000Z	alraune		<RussianPhysicsGu>did you try to use adept gui, search for usb, install ?
2008-07-16T04:39:00.000Z	alraune		<RussianPhysicsGu>( Adept manager)
2008-07-16T04:40:00.000Z	RussianPhysicsGu	alraune	no, I'll go install Adept manager and get back to you, thanks
2008-07-16T04:45:00.000Z	RussianPhysicsGu	alraune	what should I be looking for in the package list?
2008-07-16T04:48:00.000Z	RussianPhysicsGu	alraune	I did that, and there's a list of packages that contain the term "usb" in their description - is there a specific one you recommend, or should I just get one that looks relevant? (usbmount looks like it might be it)
2008-07-16T04:55:00.000Z	RussianPhysicsGu	alraune	alright, I'll get those three and get back to you, thanks so much!
2008-07-16T05:01:00.000Z	RussianPhysicsGu	alraune	I'm still not entirely sure what I'm doing, I don't see any change in how it's behaving
2008-07-16T05:04:00.000Z	RussianPhysicsGu	alraune	already done
2008-07-16T05:04:00.000Z	RussianPhysicsGu	alraune	^^^
2008-07-16T05:05:00.000Z	RussianPhysicsGu	alraune	Bus 005 Device 014: ID 041e:4128 Creative Technology, Ltd NOMAD Jukebox Zen Xtra (mtp)
2008-07-16T05:06:00.000Z	RussianPhysicsGu	alraune	lsusb is just the command that lists all usb devices attached. That's the issue: it sees that it's there, but I can't get it to mount
2008-07-16T05:10:00.000Z	RussianPhysicsGu	alraune	OH, there's a package for nomads! awesome!
2008-07-16T05:16:00.000Z	RussianPhysicsGu	alraune	that ï»¿sudo vi /etc/hotplug/usb/nomadjukebox.usermap command just gives me a blank terminal screen with a bunch of tildes (~)
2008-07-16T05:19:00.000Z	RussianPhysicsGu	alraune	alright, it's just a matter of figuring out how to configure gnomad2, I think i can figure it out from here
2008-07-16T05:20:00.000Z	RussianPhysicsGu	alraune	thanks so much for your help!
2008-07-16T05:23:00.000Z	RussianPhysicsGu	alraune	awesome. I think I actually just got it working with gnomad
2008-07-16T05:25:00.000Z	RussianPhysicsGu	alraune	well, gnomad recognizes its presence, and now it's just a matter of fiddling with that til it works
2008-07-16T05:26:00.000Z	RussianPhysicsGu	alraune	I should be fine from here, thanks again.
