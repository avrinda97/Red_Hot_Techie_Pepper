2011-03-20T13:27:00.000Z	Ors		Hi there, how can I delete the 'open with' application in firefox, because the default app is no longer installed on my pc?
2011-03-20T13:27:00.000Z	Starminn	Ors	There's usually a "Remember my selection" once you choose an app
2011-03-20T13:30:00.000Z	Ors	Starminn	I want to open with Transmission, but I do not know how to add it to the list.
2011-03-20T13:31:00.000Z	Starminn	Ors	It's not in the default droplist?
2011-03-20T13:32:00.000Z	Ors	Starminn	the default is currently Vuze, but I have installed it. I can go 'Other', but do not know wherer to find Transmission.
2011-03-20T13:36:00.000Z	Starminn	Ors	Try in /usr/bin/transmission
2011-03-20T13:36:00.000Z	Starminn	Ors	/usr/bin are where most binaries are if I recall correctly.
2011-03-20T13:40:00.000Z	Ors	Starminn	Yes, I have found it! Now how do I delete Vuze as I already uninstalled it, but it still shows default? Can I delete the entire .azureus folder?
2011-03-20T13:41:00.000Z	Starminn	Ors	I would delete whatever of it you could find (I'd say .azurreus sounds about right) in ~ and in /usr/share
2011-03-20T13:41:00.000Z	Starminn	Ors	Sometimes configs are left behind... Usually an uninstall + deleting whatever's hidden in your home directory is enough though
2011-03-20T13:42:00.000Z	Starminn		(Note: Not always in both places. Usually just one, but I, personally, like to check in both. Also, by the way, "sudo apt-get purge <packagename>" deletes all configs for you too, as opposed to "sudo apt-get remove <packagename>" which is what the Software Center does)
2011-03-20T13:46:00.000Z	Ors	Starminn	I have already deleted the filed in /usr/share, but now I also deleted the folder in home.  Thanks for your help
2011-03-20T13:48:00.000Z	Starminn	Ors	Is it gone from the list now like you wanted?
2011-03-20T13:49:00.000Z	Ors	Starminn	No, it is still there as default, but now transmission is there too.
2011-03-20T13:51:00.000Z	Starminn	Ors	Alright. Well, I'm not really sure what to say regarding getting Vuze out of there, but at least you've got Transmission now. :)
2011-03-20T13:51:00.000Z	Ors	Starminn	Exactly, that little achievment makes me happy :)
2011-03-20T13:52:00.000Z	Starminn	Ors	And you learned some neat things too! :) Learning is always fun.
2011-03-20T13:52:00.000Z	Ors	Starminn	that is why I like ubuntu!
