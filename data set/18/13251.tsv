2005-12-18T09:23:00.000Z	_linuxn00b		hey everyone
2005-12-18T09:24:00.000Z	_linuxn00b		i was hoping someone could help me fix my mbr so that i can re-install xp
2005-12-18T09:24:00.000Z	_linuxn00b		grub seems to have screwed me over
2005-12-18T09:26:00.000Z	_linuxn00b		can someone help me with a boot problem? ;)
2005-12-18T09:26:00.000Z	Toma-	_linuxn00b	you want the windows xp boot loader?
2005-12-18T09:28:00.000Z	Toma-	_linuxn00b	cant you boot winxp thru grub?
2005-12-18T09:29:00.000Z	Toma-	_linuxn00b	so.. you install it, then you try running the 2nd part from the harddrive?
2005-12-18T09:30:00.000Z	Toma-	_linuxn00b	and the "error laoding operating system" is coming after grub?
2005-12-18T09:31:00.000Z	_linuxn00b	Toma-	i beleive so... although it's not really saying anything about grub anymore
2005-12-18T09:34:00.000Z	Toma-	_linuxn00b	you should have asked when you tried dual booting
2005-12-18T09:35:00.000Z	_linuxn00b	Toma-	yeah... i'm an idiot... :(  all i want is my computer back!!! any suggestions on what to do from here?
2005-12-18T09:36:00.000Z	Toma-	_linuxn00b	its pretty tricky. you need to use the windows boot laoder or use the ubuntu disk rescue mode
2005-12-18T09:39:00.000Z	Toma-	_linuxn00b	can i ask what app you need to run for all this trouble?
2005-12-18T09:40:00.000Z	Toma-	_linuxn00b	have you tried installing windows completely over everything else?
2005-12-18T09:41:00.000Z	Toma-	_linuxn00b	then its not a linux/grub problem...
2005-12-18T09:42:00.000Z	_linuxn00b	Toma-	what could it be?
2005-12-18T09:43:00.000Z	Toma-	_linuxn00b	have you heard of crossover office?
2005-12-18T09:44:00.000Z	Toma-	_linuxn00b	have you tried gimp? instead of photoshop... its not quite the same but its pretty powerful still
