2009-12-31T17:14:00.000Z	meero	mka	command was just aptitude install whatever.... but i did a little google, and rm -rf /var/cache/apt/*.bin did the job
2009-12-31T17:16:00.000Z	mka	meero	any advantage of using aptitude over apt-get?
2009-12-31T17:17:00.000Z	meero	mka	but thanks for help, segmentation fault means really error in program (i dont know why :-)
2009-12-31T17:17:00.000Z	meero	mka	not really, just uset to it
2009-12-31T17:17:00.000Z	meero	mka	is apt-get better?
2009-12-31T17:17:00.000Z	mka	meero	I dont know I never used aptitude before
2009-12-31T17:19:00.000Z	meero	mka	aptitude has some interface if u type command alone, that is why im using it
2009-12-31T17:29:00.000Z	mka	meero	sudo apt-get install rtorrent?
2009-12-31T17:29:00.000Z	meero	mka	in chroot? :-)
2009-12-31T17:30:00.000Z	mka	meero	are you talking about the chroot I know?
2009-12-31T17:31:00.000Z	mka	meero	what are you chroot-ing to?
2009-12-31T17:31:00.000Z	meero	mka	yes, but i dont want to create/use root in chroot enviroment
2009-12-31T17:32:00.000Z	mka	meero	are you getting errors when you try to install in that env?
2009-12-31T17:35:00.000Z	meero	mka	not really, because i dont have root privilages in chroot enviroment, im just thinking - how to install it outside of chroot
2009-12-31T17:36:00.000Z	mka	meero	but you can give yourself root priviledges in the chroot env before you get into it
2009-12-31T17:37:00.000Z	meero	mka	good idea, i try it
2009-12-31T17:48:00.000Z	meero	mka	maybe a stupid question, how to add user with admin privilages in chroot ?
2009-12-31T18:04:00.000Z	mka	meero	sorry I was away, did you figure out a way?
