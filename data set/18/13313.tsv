2006-06-01T12:45:00.000Z	sally_		how do I get the network manager applet to show?  I installed gnome-network-manager
2006-06-01T12:46:00.000Z	shachaf	sally_	Run "nm-applet".
2006-06-01T12:47:00.000Z	shachaf	sally_	Or log out and back in.
2006-06-01T12:48:00.000Z	sally_	shachaf	I've used network-manager applet before and I thought it showed a list of available access points when you click on it.  when I click on this icon it doesnt show a list of access points, it just lets me configure the interface through the ubuntu network-admin, am I missing something?
2006-06-01T12:49:00.000Z	shachaf	sally_	Yes, that's a different applet.
2006-06-01T12:49:00.000Z	shachaf	sally_	Did you run nm-applet?
2006-06-01T12:50:00.000Z	sally_	shachaf	yeah but it just gives one grey-ed out choice that says wired network
2006-06-01T12:51:00.000Z	shachaf	sally_	Right click-> Enable wireless, if it's disabled?
2006-06-01T12:51:00.000Z	sally_	shachaf	I only have "enable networking" and it's checked
2006-06-01T12:51:00.000Z	shachaf	sally_	Is the wireless card working otherwise?
2006-06-01T12:52:00.000Z	sally_	shachaf	yeah it's connected now
2006-06-01T12:52:00.000Z	shachaf	sally_	Hmm.
2006-06-01T12:52:00.000Z	shachaf	sally_	Oh, I know.
2006-06-01T12:52:00.000Z	shachaf	sally_	Edit /etc/network/interfaces and comment out any lines that say anything about the interfaces.
2006-06-01T12:53:00.000Z	shachaf	sally_	Then restart dbus (/etc/init.d/dbus restart).
2006-06-01T12:53:00.000Z	shachaf	sally_	It should work.
2006-06-01T12:54:00.000Z	sally_	shachaf	yes!  thanks a lot, that worked
2006-06-01T12:55:00.000Z	shachaf	sally_	I had the same problem when I tried to enable network-manager, a while ago.
