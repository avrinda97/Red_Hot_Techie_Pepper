2007-09-21T13:20:00.000Z	dbruns		why is it that when in install apache2 on ubuntu now  /etc/init.d/apache2  start   outputs nothing... no confirmation that it started or anything
2007-09-21T13:20:00.000Z	Laibsch	dbruns	is apache really running?
2007-09-21T13:20:00.000Z	Laibsch		"pidof apache2"
2007-09-21T13:21:00.000Z	dbruns	Laibsch	no... thats the problem.. doesn't even say it didn't start...
2007-09-21T13:23:00.000Z	Laibsch	dbruns	probably a config problem.  But that is hard to troubleshoot.  Start with a very basic config and work your way from there.  Without details of your config nobody will be able to help you here.
2007-09-21T13:23:00.000Z	dbruns	Laibsch	 it is a fresh install.. default config
2007-09-21T13:24:00.000Z	dbruns	Laibsch	the /etc/apache2/ directory looks different than last time i installed apache 2
2007-09-21T13:25:00.000Z	Laibsch	dbruns	/etc/default/apache2
2007-09-21T13:25:00.000Z	Laibsch	dbruns	It might be that apache is not configured to start.  Or that you need to configure at least one server.
2007-09-21T13:25:00.000Z	dbruns	Laibsch	 huh?   there is nothing in /etc/default/apache2
2007-09-21T13:26:00.000Z	Laibsch	dbruns	Look through /usr/share/doc/apache"
2007-09-21T13:26:00.000Z	dbruns		i mean.. its not there..
2007-09-21T13:26:00.000Z	Laibsch	dbruns	Look through /usr/share/doc/apache2
2007-09-21T13:26:00.000Z	dbruns	Laibsch	k.. (i'm reading documentation now)
2007-09-21T13:26:00.000Z	dbruns		I've been reading it ;p  just came here to get ready to ask specific questions ;p
2007-09-21T13:26:00.000Z	dbruns		when they come up*
2007-09-21T13:40:00.000Z	dbruns	Laibsch	where can i view any errors logged by /etc/init.d/apache2 ?
2007-09-21T13:41:00.000Z	Laibsch	dbruns	You see them wherever you defined syslog to log it.  Usually /var/log/apache2/*error*
