2005-12-02T07:45:00.000Z	gnomefreak	PinTo	 most people in here im sure use grub because lilo doesnt come as an option unless you install it
2005-12-02T07:46:00.000Z	gnomefreak	PinTo	 if i remember right lilo and grub are not even close to each other
2005-12-02T07:47:00.000Z	gnomefreak	PinTo	did you look in /boot/grub/menu.lst to see if the new kernel is in there?
