2006-03-05T08:55:00.000Z	blrich		can someone help? upgraded to dapper, everything works fine but i'm having trouble with the gnome panel. when i enter gnome, the top panel is frozen, doesn't respond to mouse clicks, and has no applets running on it etc (just has menus). if i kill/restart it, same thing
2006-03-05T08:56:00.000Z	blrich		i think it's a session problem, or a problem with one of the panel applets
2006-03-05T08:56:00.000Z	_jason	blrich	try a making a new user and see if it happens there
2006-03-05T08:57:00.000Z	blrich	_jason	good idea i'll try
2006-03-19T07:28:00.000Z	_jason	blrich	pastebin /etc/hosts and /etc/hostname
2006-03-19T07:28:00.000Z	blrich	_jason	can i msg them to you? they're only 2 lines
2006-03-19T07:28:00.000Z	_jason	blrich	just paste it here then
2006-03-19T07:29:00.000Z	_jason	blrich	the first one is hostname I assume?
2006-03-19T07:30:00.000Z	blrich	_jason	yep
2006-03-19T07:30:00.000Z	_jason	blrich	change hostname to 'richcorp' all by itself and /etc/hosts to '/home/jasonr/docs/school/cse398/hw2.pdf
2006-03-19T07:30:00.000Z	blrich	_jason	i'm worried i might have mangled some file iceauth or dcop uses, there was a bad reset and then this trouble started
2006-03-19T07:30:00.000Z	_jason	blrich	one sec, that was a typo :)
2006-03-19T07:31:00.000Z	_jason	blrich	change hostname to 'richcorp' all by itself and /etc/hosts to '127.0.0.1 localhost.localdomain localhost richcorp'.  That's what mine look like.  That should let you use sudo at least
2006-03-19T07:31:00.000Z	blrich	_jason	why not richcorp.localhost richcorp localhost?
2006-03-19T07:32:00.000Z	_jason	blrich	sure that will work too I suppose
2006-03-19T07:32:00.000Z	blrich	_jason	LinuxJones oh my *god* found problem - in my /etc/hostname i have richcorp<new line>localhost
2006-03-19T07:33:00.000Z	blrich	_jason	LinuxJones so that explains that
2006-03-19T07:33:00.000Z	blrich	_jason	LinuxJones thanks for your help, rebooting and fixing it now =P
