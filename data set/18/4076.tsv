2010-02-07T00:29:00.000Z	edbian		FTP noob here:  Is there a way to log into an FTP server without using a firefox add-on like fireFTP ??
2010-02-07T00:29:00.000Z	Seveas	edbian	the 'ftp' command on the commandline or the gftp gui
2010-02-07T00:30:00.000Z	edbian	Seveas	With nothing but a browser
2010-02-07T00:30:00.000Z	Seveas	edbian	ftp://name.of.server
2011-12-24T04:21:00.000Z	Seveas	edbian	that's for incoming packets, but only for services that use that file (read: it's practically useless)
2011-12-24T04:22:00.000Z	edbian	Seveas	ahh, never knew that
2011-12-24T04:28:00.000Z	Seveas	edbian	yes. But you need to mount -o remount,rw / first though :)
2011-12-24T04:38:00.000Z	Seveas	edbian	avoid using backticks. They don't nest :)
2011-12-24T05:00:00.000Z	Seveas	edbian	they're not always 6 months apart.
2011-12-24T05:01:00.000Z	edbian	Seveas	I never knew that!
2011-12-24T05:02:00.000Z	Seveas	edbian	since 6.10
2011-12-24T05:02:00.000Z	edbian	Seveas	:P
2011-12-24T23:51:00.000Z	Seveas	edbian	gpasswd or useradd are easier to remember ;)
2011-12-24T23:51:00.000Z	edbian	Seveas	yeah, I had to look that one up
2011-12-24T23:52:00.000Z	edbian	Seveas	hello btw :)
2011-12-31T23:06:00.000Z	edbian	Seveas	aptitude  and apt-get cache are in /etc/apt/  ?
2011-12-31T23:06:00.000Z	Seveas	edbian	aptitude has its own cache in ~/.aptitude. The general apt cache is in /var/cache/apt and /var/lib/apt
2011-12-31T23:07:00.000Z	edbian	Seveas	ahh, yes
