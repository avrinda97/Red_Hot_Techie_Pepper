2007-12-10T10:23:00.000Z	j2daosh		ok, i have a problem. I accidently renamed my entire mp3 folder f***ed up characters and now I cant delete them because it says it cant read the info... doing an ls on the directory looks like ascii art... thats how bad i screwed the pooch. How do i delete these files? rm -f * doesn't work, rm * doesn't work either
2007-12-10T10:24:00.000Z	Cpudan80	j2daosh	Can you just remove the whole directory?
2007-12-10T10:25:00.000Z	Cpudan80	j2daosh	rmdir --ignore-fail-on-non-empty
2007-12-10T10:27:00.000Z	Cpudan80	j2daosh	You gotta give it the name of the directory
2007-12-10T10:27:00.000Z	Cpudan80	j2daosh	rmdir --..... directory
2007-12-10T10:28:00.000Z	Cpudan80	j2daosh	do it as sudo
2007-12-10T10:28:00.000Z	Cpudan80	j2daosh	or - do ps -ax | grep /music/recent/ and kill the process holding that open
2007-12-10T10:29:00.000Z	Cpudan80	j2daosh	No, running as root is dangerous
2007-12-10T10:32:00.000Z	Cpudan80	j2daosh	lol
2007-12-10T10:37:00.000Z	Cpudan80	j2daosh	...
2007-12-10T10:37:00.000Z	Cpudan80	j2daosh	No!
2007-12-10T10:37:00.000Z	Cpudan80	j2daosh	You can't rmdir a mount point...
2007-12-10T10:41:00.000Z	Cpudan80	j2daosh	what the hell...?
2007-12-10T10:41:00.000Z	Cpudan80	j2daosh	do ls -l and see who owns those files
2007-12-10T10:42:00.000Z	Cpudan80	j2daosh	Look at those timestamps... that's weird
2007-12-10T10:43:00.000Z	Cpudan80	j2daosh	rofl --- rm -rf * didn't work?
2007-12-10T10:45:00.000Z	Cpudan80	j2daosh	Staff
2007-12-10T10:49:00.000Z	Cpudan80	j2daosh	You weren't even in linux when you were asking those questions?
