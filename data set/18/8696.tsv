2007-07-11T12:59:00.000Z	kr00lplatinum	bruenig	"E: oss-linux: subprocess pre-removal script returned error exit status 2"
2007-07-11T13:00:00.000Z	bruenig	kr00lplatinum	oh, prerm script, there is a way but I am super tired and it is involved
2007-07-11T13:00:00.000Z	kr00lplatinum	bruenig	what do you suggest i do to get rid of it?
2007-07-11T13:01:00.000Z	bruenig	kr00lplatinum	in /var somewhere, there is a file called oss-linux.prerm, delete it, I don't know where it is as I am not using ubuntu any longer but I know it is in that directory somewhere
2007-07-13T12:17:00.000Z	bruenig	kr00lplatinum	put it in the ~/.xinitirc
