2007-06-16T06:22:00.000Z	openmindDJ		im having an isse with 2 sound cards in ubuntu.  Currently, I have diabled the on board sound through the bios but something still isn't right.  sometimes when i boot up the computer, the desktop sounds work.  When these work, playing audio files do not work.  asoundconf list reveals that i only have one card M2496.  When i right click on the volume icon from the task bar, select preferences, i see MAUDIO Audiophile 24/96 (Alsa Mixer) o
2007-06-16T06:22:00.000Z	openmindDJ		n the list as well as ICE1712 (OSS Mixer).  Why to I have 2 options in this drop down?  What's going on here...
2007-06-16T06:23:00.000Z	kosmonaut	openmindDJ	did you try to blacklist the soundcard that you dont need?
2007-06-16T06:23:00.000Z	openmindDJ	kosmonaut	what file should i modify...i'll give it a try
2007-06-16T06:24:00.000Z	kosmonaut	openmindDJ	take a look al the output of lsmod in the console
2007-06-16T06:25:00.000Z	kosmonaut	openmindDJ	you'll see different drivers/hardware. Try to find the driver that is responsable 4 your soundcards
2007-06-16T06:26:00.000Z	openmindDJ	kosmonaut	I see about 12 items on the list related to sound cards
2007-06-16T06:27:00.000Z	openmindDJ	kosmonaut	Code: lspci shows, Multimedia audio controller: VIA Technologies Inc. ICE1712 [Envy24]  PCI Multi-Channel I/O Controller (rev 02)
2007-06-16T06:27:00.000Z	openmindDJ	kosmonaut	Code: this is the card i want to use
2007-06-16T06:33:00.000Z	kosmonaut	openmindDJ	i am afraid to say that i am not to sure what to do here....BUT...the main thing is: you need to find out the exact name of the driver that you do NOT need. Then edit you /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist->here you just need to insert one line that says: blacklist driver/that/you/do/need
2007-06-16T06:34:00.000Z	kosmonaut	openmindDJ	if you did this->then just one soundcard will be loaded
2007-06-16T06:34:00.000Z	openmindDJ	kosmonaut	thanks for the help.  if i have disabled the onboard sound from the bios, would the driver display in lsmod?
2007-06-16T06:36:00.000Z	kosmonaut	openmindDJ	yes----I have 2 soundcards too. I have disabled the onboard sd. But still: it was loaded. I needed to blacklist the driver then the secondary scard worked
2007-06-16T06:36:00.000Z	openmindDJ	kosmonaut	thanks again!
2007-06-16T06:37:00.000Z	kosmonaut	openmindDJ	just try to find out the exact name of the soundcard driver that is resposible for your devices
2007-06-16T06:41:00.000Z	openmindDJ	kosmonaut	see anything here that resembles the dell onboard sound card? http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/25835/
2007-06-16T06:45:00.000Z	kosmonaut	openmindDJ	man....I need to eat something....don't have time to look for it now. Are you still here in 30minutes?
