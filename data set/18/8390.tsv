2008-08-30T14:44:00.000Z	jeeves__		how do I resize my NTFS partition with GParted?
2008-08-30T14:44:00.000Z	Ziroday	jeeves__	you start gparted up and use the resize option
2008-08-30T14:45:00.000Z	jeeves__	Ziroday	I launch it (sudo gparted), I can see the partition, but the resize function is greyed out
2008-08-30T14:46:00.000Z	Ziroday	jeeves__	are you on the livecd?
2008-08-30T14:46:00.000Z	jeeves__	Ziroday	no, I'm in a running copy of Ubuntu
2008-08-30T14:47:00.000Z	Ziroday	jeeves__	right click on the partition and look at the information section, look for any notices/errors/warning
2008-08-30T14:47:00.000Z	jeeves__	Ziroday	there is nothing listed as a warning, etc
2008-08-30T14:48:00.000Z	Ziroday	jeeves__	one sec
2008-08-30T14:49:00.000Z	jeeves__	Ziroday	thanks.  I'm trying to recover some space from my 100Gb partition, and parition magic is being a typical windows program
2008-08-30T14:50:00.000Z	Ziroday	jeeves__	did you unmount your ntfs filesystem after last shutdown from it?
2008-08-30T14:52:00.000Z	jeeves__	Ziroday	the NTFS is the root windows partition, and yes, it was shut down properly.  I can access it from Ubuntu
2008-08-30T14:53:00.000Z	jeeves__	Ziroday	that's why I think it's strange that it won't do it
2008-08-30T14:53:00.000Z	Ziroday	jeeves__	one sec
2008-08-30T14:54:00.000Z	jeeves__	Ziroday	ok.
2008-08-30T14:57:00.000Z	Ziroday	jeeves__	please install the packages libntfs10 and tell me if you can do it now?
2008-08-30T14:58:00.000Z	jeeves__	Ziroday	ok, one sec
2008-08-30T14:59:00.000Z	jeeves__	Ziroday	the only options I have are "unmount" "change flags" and "information" when I right click on the parititon
2008-08-30T14:59:00.000Z	jeeves__	Ziroday	and the shell is reporting that it's only opening it in read only
