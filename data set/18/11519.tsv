2006-08-29T15:21:00.000Z	_mason		Thanks, ill check it out
2006-08-29T15:21:00.000Z	_mason		^ Wont apt-get work?
2006-08-29T15:23:00.000Z	_mason		Um, martinvdk, Audacity wont detect any audio hardware?
2006-08-29T15:24:00.000Z	Justin_	_mason	Audacity suckers
2006-08-29T15:24:00.000Z	Justin_	_mason	Also make sure that you are not using your soundcard at the same time .. some cards cannot do that sort of thing under Linux
2006-08-29T15:26:00.000Z	Justin_	_mason	Ardour - if you can get jackD going ;)
2006-08-29T15:27:00.000Z	Justin_	_mason	Yeah - well Linux is not the best system for recording - I know I make music, and I still go to windows for that ---- unfortunately the audio software in Linux.. is about as sosphisticated as windows software was in 96.
2006-08-29T15:29:00.000Z	Justin_	_mason	Yeah same here - but fact of the matter is .. when it comes to music/home recording Linux is far far behind windows
2006-08-29T15:29:00.000Z	_mason	Justin_	And its a shame to
2006-08-29T15:29:00.000Z	Justin_	_mason	Yeah - but as a coding/network/work platform - Linux nails it
2006-08-29T15:32:00.000Z	Justin_	_mason	Yeah better luck next year :P
2006-08-29T15:34:00.000Z	Justin_	_mason	Linux has flash :D
2006-08-29T15:51:00.000Z	_mason	Justin_	I think it beat him as a child :P
2006-08-29T15:51:00.000Z	Justin_	_mason	 :)) well flash does suck though..
2006-08-29T15:51:00.000Z	_mason	Justin_	Pfft, to each his own.. but flash brings in the money
2006-08-29T15:53:00.000Z	_mason	Justin_	 If you immediately knew the candle light was fire then the meal was cooked a long time ago.
