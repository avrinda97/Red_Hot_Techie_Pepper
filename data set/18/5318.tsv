2011-10-22T06:20:00.000Z	intangir	Roasted	whats wrong?
2011-10-22T06:20:00.000Z	Roasted	intangir	I have an old laptop that ran great on every version of ubuntu so far. I put 11.10 on and installed gnome shell because I prefer that to unity. I was logged in several times and all of the sudden when I logged in again it went to gnome classic.
2011-10-22T06:20:00.000Z	Roasted	intangir	no error, no rhyme or reason. It worked great, then just began routing me to gnome classic. I have no idea why.
2011-10-22T06:21:00.000Z	Roasted	intangir	now granted its an older computer, 1.5ghz celeron M with 1gb of RAM (upgraded from 256 originally) but it worked fine for about 30 minutes on gnome shell and all of the sudden it gives me the bird. Oh, and Unity works fine on it. No drivers available in the hardware manager.
2011-10-22T06:21:00.000Z	Roasted	intangir	using an ATI Xpress 200M
2011-10-22T06:21:00.000Z	Roasted	intangir	yes, but that's not the end goal.
2011-10-22T06:22:00.000Z	intangir	Roasted	are you going thru a login manager?
2011-10-22T06:22:00.000Z	Roasted	intangir	lightdm, default in 11.10
2011-10-22T06:23:00.000Z	Roasted	intangir	yes. although, I wonder if I'm getting kicked to unity 2d?
2011-10-22T06:23:00.000Z	Roasted	intangir	how can I tell if Im in unity 2d or 3d?
2011-10-22T06:24:00.000Z	Roasted	intangir	if I'm in unity 2d I'll stop freaking out since that would make sense. but if unity 3d works and gnome shell doesnt I'll be kind of "what the?!"
2011-10-22T06:24:00.000Z	intangir	Roasted	in the login manager when you select your username, there is a gear on the top right of the box, are their options for gnome on the dropdown list?
2011-10-22T06:24:00.000Z	Roasted	intangir	yes. I'm choosing gnome shell.
2011-10-22T06:24:00.000Z	Roasted	intangir	I'm just questioning if its kicking me to unity 2d when I log in due to lack of hardware
2011-10-22T06:25:00.000Z	Roasted	intangir	there were none to update.
2011-10-22T06:30:00.000Z	Roasted	intangir	wow
2011-10-22T06:31:00.000Z	Roasted	intangir	just logged in as unity. I logged in as 3d and 2d (ubuntu and ubuntu 2d) to compare how they looked different, Ic ouldnt see a difference. so I checked syslog and theer's an entry: WARNING: Session "ubuntu" runnable check failed: Exited with cod$"
2011-10-22T06:31:00.000Z	Roasted	intangir	SAME error I got with gnome shell. I MUST be falling back to unity 2d without it telling me I am
