2010-07-28T08:46:00.000Z	natex	livingdaylight	flash is spotty on linux. Are you using 64 bit? Or 32?
2010-07-28T08:47:00.000Z	livingdaylight	natex	32 - I think
2010-07-28T08:47:00.000Z	natex	livingdaylight	other flash sites work?
2010-07-28T08:48:00.000Z	livingdaylight	natex	youtube etc, YES
2010-07-28T08:49:00.000Z	natex	livingdaylight	what is the web address?
2010-07-28T08:50:00.000Z	livingdaylight	natex	http://www.paltalk.com/express/
2010-07-28T08:52:00.000Z	natex	livingdaylight	I'm using default Ubuntu java and flash. It's working for me.
2010-07-28T08:52:00.000Z	livingdaylight	natex	that's frustrating then
2010-07-28T08:53:00.000Z	natex	livingdaylight	yeah
2010-07-28T08:53:00.000Z	natex	livingdaylight	update your flash?
2010-07-28T08:53:00.000Z	livingdaylight	natex	how so?
2010-07-28T08:54:00.000Z	natex	livingdaylight	sudo apt-get install flashplugin-installer
2010-07-28T08:55:00.000Z	livingdaylight	natex	looks like I already have the newest version. And you're running sun's java or the opensource version which ubuntu is set to by default?
2010-07-28T08:56:00.000Z	natex	livingdaylight	java-common (non-Sun I think)
