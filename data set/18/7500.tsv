2008-02-06T04:12:00.000Z	idefix		normally you download software and install it from the /tmp dir?
2008-02-06T04:12:00.000Z	idefix		or from your user dir?
2008-02-06T04:12:00.000Z	idefix		installation doesn't seem to go correctly
2008-02-06T04:12:00.000Z	idefix		why does linux always put downloaded stuff in /tmp?
2008-02-06T04:13:00.000Z	idefix		don't do that p0rk
2008-02-06T04:13:00.000Z	idefix		use windows or linux and wine
2008-02-06T04:13:00.000Z	Webu	idefix	how are you trying to install software?
2008-02-06T04:13:00.000Z	Webu	idefix	make and make install right?
2008-02-06T04:15:00.000Z	Webu	idefix	how do you download stuff :O?
2008-02-06T04:16:00.000Z	Webu	idefix	you're trying to install this? http://www.pandanet.co.jp/English/glgo/download.html
2008-02-06T04:18:00.000Z	idefix	Webu	when you use ubuntu which extension fits?
2008-02-06T04:18:00.000Z	Webu	idefix	i'd suggest to download that Debian package and do a "dpkg -i glGo-1.4.deb" as stated in instructions :)
2008-02-06T04:19:00.000Z	Webu	idefix	Debian packages should work fine since Ubuntu is Debian based.
2008-02-06T04:20:00.000Z	idefix	Webu	but what in general is the best directory to install programs for?
2008-02-06T04:21:00.000Z	Webu	idefix	download it anywhere you want, i'd prefer your home directory.
2008-02-06T04:21:00.000Z	Webu	idefix	it installs it automatically where it should, you don't have to worry anything.
2008-02-06T04:22:00.000Z	Webu	idefix	dpkg and/or the program you install takes care of all that stuff.
2008-02-06T04:24:00.000Z	Webu	idefix	just to clear out, you can find most of the software you need from Ubuntu repositories (http://packages.ubuntu.com/), they're all ready-to-go packages to install with "sudo apt-get install programname" like "sudo apt-get install planetpenguin". If you prefer to use GUI (Graphical User Interface, not command line), Synaptic does the job like apt-get in command line.
