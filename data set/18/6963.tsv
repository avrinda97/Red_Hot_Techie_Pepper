2008-08-20T14:21:00.000Z	hischild	Ubuntu_noob	please ask them in the channel so we all can help
2008-08-20T14:22:00.000Z	hischild	Ubuntu_noob	1. go to system administration and then synaptic package manager. 2. They'll have shortcuts in your menu.
2008-08-20T14:23:00.000Z	hischild	Ubuntu_noob	and about the third one you'll have to be more specific.
2008-08-20T14:24:00.000Z	hischild	Ubuntu_noob	you mean you want to change your MAC adress of your network card?
2008-08-20T14:24:00.000Z	Ubuntu_noob	hischild	yes, and ifconfig don't work
2008-08-20T14:24:00.000Z	hischild	Ubuntu_noob	ifconfig will work. Please share the command you tried with us.
2008-08-20T14:26:00.000Z	hischild	Ubuntu_noob	try not to use so many enters please. do you still have that console open?
2008-08-20T14:28:00.000Z	hischild	Ubuntu_noob	ifconfig eth0 down will make sure it's down. Run ifconfig and it shouldn't show anymore to check. Then use << ifconfig eth0 hw ether 1a:2b:3c:4d:5e:6f >> to change it to that MAC (without the << and >> ofcourse)
2008-08-20T14:28:00.000Z	hischild	Ubuntu_noob	then lastly you have to get it back up with ifconfig eth0 up
2008-08-20T14:28:00.000Z	Ubuntu_noob	hischild	i did, and it says SIOSIFFLAGS Error
2008-08-20T14:29:00.000Z	hischild	Ubuntu_noob	did you run the commands as root?
