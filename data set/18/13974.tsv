2006-01-20T07:07:00.000Z	Hikaru79		I'm trying to install Java following the instructions I get on the wiki. However, I'm getting that "No matching plugin was found." error, and the solution on the wiki isn't working. Anybody have an idea?
2006-01-20T07:08:00.000Z	_jason	Hikaru79	when are you gettting that error?
2006-01-20T07:08:00.000Z	Hikaru79	_jason	when I do this: geoff@trademeet:~/archive/programming$ DEB_BUILD_GNU_TYPE=i386 fakeroot make-jpkg jre-1_5_0_06-linux-i586-1.bin
2006-01-20T07:09:00.000Z	_jason	Hikaru79	seems like you made a typo
2006-01-20T07:10:00.000Z	_jason	Hikaru79	from the wiki: DEB_BUILD_GNU_TYPE=i386-linux
2006-01-20T07:10:00.000Z	Hikaru79	_jason	I know, I tried with i386-linux too
2006-01-20T07:11:00.000Z	_jason	Hikaru79	maybe they mean export DEB_BUILD_GNU_TYPE=i386-linux; and then do the rest of the line.
2006-01-20T07:11:00.000Z	Hikaru79	_jason	I'll try that :)
2006-01-20T07:14:00.000Z	Hikaru79	_jason	I get the same thing :( I know I exported right because when I echo the var, it returns i386-linux ...
2006-01-20T07:16:00.000Z	_jason	Hikaru79	are you using 64bit?
2006-01-20T07:16:00.000Z	Hikaru79	_jason	of course not ^ ^:
2006-01-20T07:19:00.000Z	Hikaru79	_jason	any other ideas? :(
2006-01-20T07:19:00.000Z	_jason	Hikaru79	you are doing this on a 386?
2006-01-20T07:20:00.000Z	Hikaru79	_jason	yes. The arch is right.
2006-01-20T07:21:00.000Z	_jason	Hikaru79	do you *need* to build it?  There are ready-made deb's available
2006-01-20T07:21:00.000Z	Hikaru79	_jason	there are?! Point me to 'em! :D
2006-01-20T07:22:00.000Z	Hikaru79	_jason	you *are* my hero. Thanks :D
2006-01-20T07:22:00.000Z	_jason	Hikaru79	wait until after it installs successfully ;o
