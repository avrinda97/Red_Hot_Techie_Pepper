2012-02-16T07:09:00.000Z	rksii		hello, anyone here?
2012-02-16T07:10:00.000Z	rksii		lol, it just seems awfully quiet
2012-02-16T07:11:00.000Z	rksii		I am trying to get suspend/hibernate to work on my Toshiba L775
2012-02-16T07:12:00.000Z	rksii		I've tried all the quirks options and several of the scripts I found searching the community forums and other places but no luck
2012-02-16T07:13:00.000Z	rksii		thought maybe someone here would have some advice
2012-02-16T07:13:00.000Z	_Marcus	rksii	What exactly is happening?
2012-02-16T07:16:00.000Z	_Marcus	rksii	I can't tell if that is a problem with Ubuntu or with the Tobisha hardware.
2012-02-16T07:17:00.000Z	_Marcus	rksii	I found this online: http://nixliving.blogspot.com/2010/03/workaround-for-broken-ubuntu-suspend.html
2012-02-16T07:18:00.000Z	_Marcus	rksii	How long are you waiting until you force shutdown your machine?
2012-02-16T07:20:00.000Z	_Marcus	rksii	Intresting. As I don't have a Tobisha laptop, I cannot reproduce the problem. You should read that page though.
2012-02-16T07:22:00.000Z	_Marcus	rksii	There you go
2012-02-16T07:23:00.000Z	_Marcus	rksii	I'm guessing you want one of the laptop-mode-tools one
2012-02-16T07:25:00.000Z	_Marcus	rksii	That was a command for ubottu, the bot here. It just gave you info about it
2012-02-16T07:26:00.000Z	_Marcus	rksii	Do you have an intel processor?
2012-02-16T07:29:00.000Z	_Marcus	rksii	Try "apt-get install laptop-mode-tools"
2012-02-16T07:32:00.000Z	_Marcus	rksii	I don't know what the solution to your problem is. If laptop-mode-tools isn't working, then do "sudo apt-get remove laptop-mode-tools"
2012-02-16T07:33:00.000Z	_Marcus	rksii	yes
2012-02-16T07:36:00.000Z	_Marcus	rksii	So I have no idea on how to fix it. Ask again in the channel, someone else may be able to help.
