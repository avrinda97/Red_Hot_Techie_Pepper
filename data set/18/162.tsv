2012-08-31T23:05:00.000Z	piotr_kuna		sander?
2012-08-31T23:07:00.000Z	W4sp	piotr_kuna	You are required to have GRUB2 on each of the HDDs any RAID array has.
2012-08-31T23:07:00.000Z	piotr_kuna		i think is shoud show at least the grub rescue mode or some error
2012-08-31T23:08:00.000Z	piotr_kuna	W4sp	grub1.99 is Grub2?
2012-08-31T23:08:00.000Z	W4sp	piotr_kuna	Yes.
2012-08-31T23:09:00.000Z	piotr_kuna	W4sp	so i have GRUB2, i have reinstalled it on all drives
2012-08-31T23:09:00.000Z	piotr_kuna	W4sp	with grub-install /dev/sda and so on
2012-08-31T23:09:00.000Z	piotr_kuna	W4sp	no errors reported but it hangs on a try to boot
2012-08-31T23:10:00.000Z	piotr_kuna	W4sp	except on the first drive, it shows the grub menu
2012-08-31T23:10:00.000Z	piotr_kuna	W4sp	but the drive is faling, i need to replace it qucikly
2012-08-31T23:14:00.000Z	W4sp	piotr_kuna	Your RAID is already on error...?
2012-08-31T23:14:00.000Z	piotr_kuna	W4sp	yes, i have removed one drive from the array
2012-08-31T23:16:00.000Z	W4sp	piotr_kuna	If you want to have the good one mounted you would require a CD to mount the partition. You may be able to install GRUB onto the HDD that doesn't come up at the moment.
2012-08-31T23:18:00.000Z	piotr_kuna	W4sp	i can boot the system connecting the failed drive, grub shows up and it boots then (rescue mode, have to accept degraded raid),
2012-08-31T23:18:00.000Z	piotr_kuna	W4sp	then i have reinstalled grub several times on all drives - it does not help
2012-08-31T23:23:00.000Z	W4sp	piotr_kuna	Oh, i didn't know you get that far. Here's a howto guide that may assist you further. http://askubuntu.com/questions/83577/how-to-repair-a-degraded-raid
2012-08-31T23:24:00.000Z	piotr_kuna	W4sp	i know how to repair the raid, but to do that i need to attach a new drive, i can not do this when my system does not boot from the second drive
