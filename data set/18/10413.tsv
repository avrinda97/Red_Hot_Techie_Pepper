2006-12-17T16:20:00.000Z	Valmarko		whats the best way to implement plugins for flash , tv streaming and other related in Firefox?
2006-12-17T16:20:00.000Z	bruenig	Valmarko	install them
2006-12-17T16:21:00.000Z	bruenig	Valmarko	for video, sudo apt-get install mozilla-mplayer
2006-12-18T17:27:00.000Z	bruenig	Valmarko	no
2006-12-18T17:27:00.000Z	bruenig	Valmarko	are you using ubuntu firefox or did you install the firefox from firefox, I know there are some scripts that do that and quite a few people do it
2006-12-18T17:29:00.000Z	bruenig	Valmarko	do ls /usr/lib/firefox/plugins, there should be a libflashplayer.so in there
2006-12-18T17:29:00.000Z	bruenig	Valmarko	or more accurately a symbolic link to libflashplayer.so
2006-12-18T17:30:00.000Z	bruenig	Valmarko	so was libflashplayer.so in there
2006-12-18T17:35:00.000Z	bruenig	Valmarko	you are saying that flash works in one of your browsers?
2006-12-18T17:30:00.000Z	bruenig	Valmarko	all I asked was whether one thing was in there. All you had to do was read the output, look for libflashplayer.so and then tell me if it was there
2006-12-18T17:31:00.000Z	bruenig	Valmarko	ok, so now do ls /usr/lib/flashplugin-nonfree, tell me if libflashplayer.so is in there
2006-12-18T17:33:00.000Z	bruenig	Valmarko	hmmm, ok one more spot, ls /usr/lib/mozilla-firefox/plugins, see if libflashplayer.so is in there
2006-12-18T17:34:00.000Z	bruenig	Valmarko	or actually there is one more than that, ls /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins
2006-12-18T17:35:00.000Z	Valmarko	bruenig	No
2006-12-18T17:36:00.000Z	bruenig	Valmarko	what browser does flash work in?
2006-12-18T17:37:00.000Z	bruenig	Valmarko	open a fresh terminal and do this: wget http://3v1n0.tuxfamily.org/pool/edgy/3v1n0/flashplugin-nonfree_9.0.21.78-3v1ubuntu0_i386.deb && sudo dpkg -i flashplugin-nonfree_9.0.21.78-3v1ubuntu0_i386.deb
2006-12-18T17:39:00.000Z	bruenig	Valmarko	what happened when you did that?
2006-12-18T17:40:00.000Z	bruenig	Valmarko	ls /usr/lib/firefox/plugins
