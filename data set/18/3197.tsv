2010-07-04T19:02:00.000Z	RPS		Hello Guys, I'm using Ubuntu 8.10 and I have lost my sound (yet again.) I've had this issue before, but it happened so long ago I honestly can't remember where to start. I'll gladly open my terminal and absorb any help that you guys might be able to offer.
2010-07-04T19:02:00.000Z	RPS		I only get a crackling sound from my speakers
2010-07-04T19:03:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	RPS	are you using alsa?
2010-07-04T19:05:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	RPS	go into a terminal type alsamixer
2010-07-04T19:07:00.000Z	RPS	aeon-ltd	the master is turned all the way up. It shows HAD Intel as the card
2010-07-04T19:09:00.000Z	RPS	aeon-ltd	is this the line I should use? sudo aptitude --purge reinstall linux-sound-base alsa-base alsa-utils linux-image-`uname -r` linux-ubuntu-modules-`uname -r` libasound2
2010-07-04T19:10:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	RPS	don't bother, in alsamixer are any the outputs showing mm?
2010-07-04T19:11:00.000Z	RPS	aeon-ltd	No, I don;t see anything labeled as mm
2010-07-04T19:11:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	RPS	all bars are maxed out?
2010-07-04T19:11:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	RPS	max out all of them
2010-07-04T19:13:00.000Z	RPS	aeon-ltd	I can;t see a way to turn up the others ...PCM, IEC958
2010-07-04T19:13:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	RPS	up on the arrow keys
2010-07-04T19:15:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	RPS	what are you usng to test sound?
2010-07-04T19:15:00.000Z	RPS	aeon-ltd	Well.... that was the single MOST simplest linux fix I have ever been involved with. LOL
