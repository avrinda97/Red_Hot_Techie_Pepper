2005-10-03T10:11:00.000Z	Toma-	Oris	check your cpu fan is working
2005-10-03T10:12:00.000Z	Toma-	Oris	its in your bios. probably under PC health/status option
2005-10-03T10:15:00.000Z	Toma-	Oris	i answered.
2005-10-03T10:19:00.000Z	Toma-	Oris	nope. its a bios 'feature'
2005-10-03T10:20:00.000Z	Toma-	Oris	its a thing the bios does.
2005-10-03T10:20:00.000Z	Toma-	Oris	...possibly?
2005-10-03T10:23:00.000Z	Toma-	Oris	youre bios controls when to shutdown the CPU....
2005-10-03T10:23:00.000Z	Toma-	Oris	cat /proc/acpi/thermal_zone/THRM/trip_points
2005-10-03T10:24:00.000Z	Toma-	Oris	i dont wanna give u bad advice... ive never tinkered with thermal settings. im too scared to melt my cpu. try google or someone else
2005-10-03T10:44:00.000Z	Toma-	Oris	there u go, 'noacpi'
2005-10-03T10:27:00.000Z	Toma-	Oris	do u know how hot your cpu is running?
2005-10-03T10:30:00.000Z	Toma-	Oris	try acpi=off at the bootline
2005-10-03T10:46:00.000Z	Toma-	Oris	probably best.
2005-10-03T10:46:00.000Z	Toma-	Oris	i just hope the ubuntu team havent removed the acpi=off option from the kernel or something stupid like that
