2009-01-24T08:22:00.000Z	jedi06		ok carl-m what type ext3?
2009-01-24T08:22:00.000Z	jedi06		logical
2009-01-24T08:22:00.000Z	jedi06		didn't see that
2009-01-24T08:23:00.000Z	jedi06		ok should i put it at the end as location or beginning
2009-01-24T08:23:00.000Z	jedi06		i think i want it at end
2009-01-24T08:23:00.000Z	jedi06		i want my other partitiong together
2009-01-24T08:23:00.000Z	jedi06		logical or primary
2009-01-24T08:24:00.000Z	lifenova	jedi06	logical for swap
2009-01-24T08:30:00.000Z	lifenova	jedi06	what other OS's do you have? any?
2009-01-24T08:31:00.000Z	lifenova	jedi06	and you don't already have a seperate home, right?
2009-01-24T08:32:00.000Z	lifenova	jedi06	here's what I have set up. delete your fedora partition altogether
2009-01-24T08:32:00.000Z	jedi06	lifenova	i already did that
2009-01-24T08:32:00.000Z	lifenova	jedi06	then make an extended of about 20 gig
2009-01-24T08:32:00.000Z	lifenova	jedi06	in the extended, make one for your root filesystem, and then your swap
2009-01-24T08:33:00.000Z	lifenova	jedi06	and then make a primary for home
2009-01-24T08:34:00.000Z	lifenova	jedi06	sorry, 5 gig is about the bare min I'd say for root, but you can give more to let it have more to breathe. I misspoke when I said 20
2009-01-24T08:35:00.000Z	lifenova	jedi06	should be an option in gparted
2009-01-24T08:40:00.000Z	lifenova	jedi06	wait, swap should be logical so you'd have exactly 4
