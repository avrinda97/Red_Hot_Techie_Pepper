2008-10-12T18:17:00.000Z	jrib	_moro_bana_	mount
2008-10-12T18:18:00.000Z	_moro_bana_	jrib	any other way, its not showing one of the hdd?
2008-10-12T18:18:00.000Z	jrib	_moro_bana_	then it's not mounted.  What do you actually want to do?
2008-10-12T18:19:00.000Z	_moro_bana_	jrib	i can see it from "my computer", i wanna see the mount point, want to make a clone on the hdd
2008-10-12T18:20:00.000Z	jrib	_moro_bana_	that doesn't mean it's mounted.  Maybe you want the output of 'sudo fdisk -l' instead
2008-10-12T18:20:00.000Z	_moro_bana_	jrib	yes exactly, i forgot that, thanks
2009-01-12T19:08:00.000Z	jrib	_moro_bana_	no, it should upgrade them
2009-01-12T19:09:00.000Z	_moro_bana_	jrib	does it download the whole system?
