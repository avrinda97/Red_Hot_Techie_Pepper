2012-04-11T17:31:00.000Z	matmats		linux is like heart surgery
2012-04-11T17:32:00.000Z	matmats		the chars show up correctly here, and they make sense, mostly
2012-04-11T17:33:00.000Z	matmats		so nobody can help me with fstab here?
2012-04-11T17:35:00.000Z	matmats		mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sdb1, ...
2012-04-11T17:35:00.000Z	geekbri	matmats	your entry looks correct, is the device formatted as ext3?
2012-04-11T17:36:00.000Z	geekbri	matmats	what does this output: files -s /dev/sdb1
2012-04-11T17:38:00.000Z	geekbri	matmats	whoops, file not files
2012-04-11T17:39:00.000Z	geekbri	matmats	ok well, that should work even on an unmounted drive so I suspect that the issue with your drive mounting has nothing to do with your fstab entry
2012-04-11T17:40:00.000Z	geekbri	matmats	it might be bad, it might not be so bad.
2012-04-11T17:40:00.000Z	geekbri	matmats	sorry, did you make sure to run the command with sudo?  Try it with sudo and see if you get the same output
2012-04-11T17:42:00.000Z	geekbri	matmats	well for some reason your OS cannot see the drive,  I would start with very basic steps... make sure all the cables are plugged in fully
2012-04-11T17:42:00.000Z	geekbri	matmats	then after you've ensured its connected ok, i would try to work from that.
2012-04-11T17:45:00.000Z	geekbri	matmats	on a side note, often a good way to find out what to make an fstab entry is to mount the device manually then do cat /etc/mtab and it will show you the current settings.  Often you can just copy paste that into fstab
2012-04-11T17:48:00.000Z	geekbri	matmats	did you change anything?
2012-04-11T17:49:00.000Z	geekbri	matmats	sleep mode is always a total pain.
2012-04-11T17:51:00.000Z	geekbri	matmats	surprised that files -s isn't giving more information than that.
2012-04-11T17:52:00.000Z	geekbri	matmats	that looks correct to me.
2012-04-11T17:53:00.000Z	geekbri	matmats	looking at your entry it is, it says right there :)
