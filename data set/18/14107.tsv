2008-08-26T05:28:00.000Z	Flannel	Mat1	that's what you need to do.
2008-08-26T05:28:00.000Z	Flannel	Mat1	wubi only uses the windows bootloader.
2008-08-26T05:29:00.000Z	Flannel	Mat1	you don't with your current set up.  You'd have to do a proper dualboot
2008-08-26T05:33:00.000Z	Flannel	Mat1	I believe you can, yes.
2008-08-26T05:34:00.000Z	Flannel	Mat1	edit your boot.ini, there's a default line.  You might ask in ##windows for actual specifics.
2008-08-26T05:35:00.000Z	Flannel	Mat1	C:\boot.ini
2008-08-26T05:36:00.000Z	Flannel	Mat1	there's always tomorrow.
2008-09-01T23:19:00.000Z	Flannel	Mat1	Why do you need to log in to a GUI with root?
2008-09-01T23:24:00.000Z	Flannel	Mat1	A single file?
2008-09-01T23:24:00.000Z	Flannel	Mat1	Which file, if you don't mind me asking?
2008-09-01T23:26:00.000Z	Flannel	Mat1	You shouldn't need sudo something to move it to your own home folder
