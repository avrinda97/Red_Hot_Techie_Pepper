2006-01-13T16:29:00.000Z	bshumate	freak	i've been running 64-bit Sun Ultrasparcs with Solaris for about five years now man
2006-01-13T16:29:00.000Z	freak	bshumate	thats Solaris, not linux or windows
2006-01-13T16:30:00.000Z	freak	bshumate	which is what the new macintosh operating system is based upon
2006-01-13T16:30:00.000Z	bshumate	freak	you said, and i quote "with the operating systems we have right now" is Solaris not an operating system?
2006-01-13T16:31:00.000Z	freak	bshumate	ok sorry, i meant just the more popular ones
2006-01-13T16:31:00.000Z	bshumate	freak	really? is it based on mmmmmm, say FreeBSD? that's not news to me.
2006-01-13T16:31:00.000Z	freak	bshumate	solaris is too expensive for most home users
2006-01-13T16:31:00.000Z	bshumate	freak	Solaris is free these days dude
2006-01-13T16:32:00.000Z	freak	bshumate	FreeBSD is not as popular as Linux
2006-01-13T16:32:00.000Z	freak	bshumate	last i heard it ran on expensive as hell sun microsystems hardware, but, i dont follow up on solaris
2006-01-13T16:35:00.000Z	freak	bshumate	well i think you're the only person ive heard of using solaris for jack
2006-01-13T16:37:00.000Z	bshumate	freak	and you're probably the one person i have talked to who knows the absolute least about 64-bit architectures...isn't this just fun? ;-)
2006-01-13T16:38:00.000Z	freak	bshumate	dude, 64bit architecture sucks right now, when microsoft gets their heads out of their asses and get longhorn(Vista) out, then64bit arch will be worth the money
2006-01-13T16:38:00.000Z	freak	bshumate	but until then, most people are running their AMD 64 3500's on the 32bit version of windows
2006-01-13T16:39:00.000Z	bshumate	freak	you said it and it must be true! and what you're blathering on about now is OT in hear, so whatever...
2006-01-13T16:41:00.000Z	freak	bshumate	does it get you off that you think you're right?
2006-01-13T16:42:00.000Z	bshumate	freak	drop it man...it's offtopic
