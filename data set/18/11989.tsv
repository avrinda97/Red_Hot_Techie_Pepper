2009-08-22T20:17:00.000Z	boingboingbongg		I have dell studio 15 with a 9 cell battery . it gives around 10 hours back up on windows vista but on ubuntu it only gives around 4 hours .. whats wrong?
2009-08-22T20:18:00.000Z	stefg	boingboingbongg	run powertop and find out ... first thing is to get rid of mono immediatly
2009-08-22T20:19:00.000Z	stefg	boingboingbongg	sudo apt-get autoremove libmono0 (will take some applications fike fspot  and tomboy away, too)
2009-08-22T20:20:00.000Z	stefg	boingboingbongg	you don't know about your system load :-) because you don't know how often the cpu or some chip wake up
2009-08-22T20:21:00.000Z	stefg	boingboingbongg	useless info
2009-08-22T20:25:00.000Z	stefg	boingboingbongg	run sudo powertop
2009-08-22T20:28:00.000Z	stefg	boingboingbongg	it doesn't work that way. powertop is reporting and suggesting things ... one after the other. you have to look and read what powertop is telling you.
2009-08-22T20:30:00.000Z	stefg	boingboingbongg	and i can tell you upfront that mono is a cpu hog and waking up the cpu far too often... get rid of it. next make sure your cpu frq-scaling is working properly
2009-08-22T20:30:00.000Z	stefg	boingboingbongg	the most obvious problem... the ati-drivers are junk... sad, but a fact of life
2009-08-22T20:31:00.000Z	stefg	boingboingbongg	exactly... that's why they are junk
2009-08-22T20:35:00.000Z	stefg	boingboingbongg	buy an Nvidia card ...
2009-08-22T20:35:00.000Z	stefg	boingboingbongg	buy anNvidia card ...
2009-08-22T20:35:00.000Z	stefg	boingboingbongg	buy /supported/ Nvidia card ...
2009-08-22T20:36:00.000Z	stefg	boingboingbongg	buy an Nvidia card ?
2009-08-22T20:39:00.000Z	stefg	boingboingbongg	I know bad hardware support can ruin the whole day.... but i'm relatively sure that there'S a solution out on the web... dig a bit. I'm no ati expert, b/c i like to stay out of troubles way and always check linux support before i buy hardware
2009-08-22T21:14:00.000Z	stefg	boingboingbongg	no, wrong factoid
2009-08-22T21:18:00.000Z	stefg	boingboingbongg	the real reason is: all operating systems suck, linux (and ubuntu in particular) just sucks less. And because it takes a while to recognize that,  we kill some time in here :-)
2009-08-22T21:26:00.000Z	stefg	boingboingbongg	you found your man... phreck you probably should talk to phreck
