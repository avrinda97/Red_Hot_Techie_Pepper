2008-07-06T05:52:00.000Z	Fryguy--	pharo	you can edit /etc/apt/sources.list to choose where packages get installed from (and synaptic provides a front end for managing this as well)
2008-07-06T05:53:00.000Z	pharo	Fryguy--	it only makes it possible to install the packages that are on the disk ...not more
2008-07-06T05:53:00.000Z	pharo	Fryguy--	that's not the same
2008-07-06T05:54:00.000Z	Fryguy--	pharo	i'm pretty sure that's not true
2008-07-06T05:54:00.000Z	pharo	Fryguy--	ok, then I must be right... in that case... please help me by showing that I am wrong...
2008-07-06T05:55:00.000Z	pharo	Fryguy--	I'm in Synaptic now... what do I have to do
2008-07-06T05:55:00.000Z	Fryguy--	pharo	edit available repositories
2008-07-06T05:55:00.000Z	Fryguy--	pharo	it's in one of the menus
2008-07-06T05:56:00.000Z	pharo	Fryguy--	ba adding the cd yes I did that
2008-07-06T05:56:00.000Z	Fryguy--	pharo	so add repositories for the internte
2008-07-06T05:56:00.000Z	pharo	Fryguy--	did that
2008-07-06T05:57:00.000Z	Fryguy--	pharo	so now apt uses internet sources where available.  What is the problem?
2008-07-06T05:57:00.000Z	pharo	Fryguy--	that I still dont have upgraded to ubuntu studio
2008-07-06T05:57:00.000Z	Fryguy--	pharo	what are you running now
2008-07-06T05:59:00.000Z	pharo	Fryguy--	and just chosing the seperate metapackages in synaptic does not install everything that the popup would if I figured that correctly... because the synaptic metapackages dont install things like the rt-kernel... it only recommends it
2008-07-06T05:59:00.000Z	pharo	Fryguy--	Hardy Heron Ubunut
