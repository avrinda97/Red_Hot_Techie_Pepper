2006-03-11T07:33:00.000Z	soundray	whiter	I've got dapper and gnome 2.13.92 and I don't see that big a difference.
2006-05-06T06:28:00.000Z	soundray	whiter	what do you want to do with your camera?
2006-05-06T06:30:00.000Z	soundray	whiter	if you plug it in, gthumb should start automatically and offer to copy the photos off the camera.
2006-05-06T06:31:00.000Z	soundray	whiter	that's right. That's the default for Ubuntu, too.
2008-02-12T04:55:00.000Z	soundray	whiter	acpi=off should be avoided. Have you tried pci=noacpi instead?
2008-02-12T04:55:00.000Z	whiter	soundray	ill try it right now
2008-02-12T04:57:00.000Z	whiter	soundray	it stops at Scanning CD-ROM 7% with that option
2008-02-12T04:58:00.000Z	soundray	whiter	okay, sorry, I don't think I'll be able to help then
