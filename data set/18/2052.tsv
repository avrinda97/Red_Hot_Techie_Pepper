2010-09-03T08:11:00.000Z	heizmann		:-/ nobody for helping me to solve my pb?
2010-09-03T08:12:00.000Z	brunner	heizmann	be patient, please.
2010-09-03T08:12:00.000Z	heizmann	brunner	^^ sorry...
2010-09-03T08:13:00.000Z	brunner	heizmann	no worries.  also, it may help to ask a clear question, rather than just pasting a link, if you haven't already
2010-09-03T08:15:00.000Z	heizmann	brunner	:) okay, question is: how to send a request for a direct connection without using the "web page" (I'm connecting Internet behind a captive portal)
2010-09-03T08:15:00.000Z	heizmann	brunner	maybe by using curl? :-| but I'm not sure
2010-09-03T08:16:00.000Z	brunner	heizmann	I don't really understand what you mean by a "request for a direct connection"
2010-09-03T08:16:00.000Z	brunner	heizmann	can you be more specific, and provide some context?
2010-09-03T08:16:00.000Z	heizmann	brunner	sorry... :-/ no for Python...
2010-09-03T08:17:00.000Z	brunner	heizmann	don't be sorry. I jut want to understand your question.
2010-09-03T08:18:00.000Z	brunner	heizmann	if you're just trying to send an HTTP GET request, wget should indeed do the trick fine.
2010-09-03T08:19:00.000Z	heizmann	brunner	the context: when I want to connect a Internet, I must use a browser, like firefox; I have to fill the fields like my login and password, and confirm the charter of Service.
2010-09-03T08:20:00.000Z	heizmann	brunner	Saisissez du texte, l'adresse d'un site Web ou importez un document Ã  traduire.
2010-09-03T08:21:00.000Z	heizmann	brunner	I wish I could connect to the Internet without fulfilling this page in my web browser.
2010-09-03T08:22:00.000Z	brunner	heizmann	You just need a script or browser plug in that fills in the info for you, then?
2010-09-03T08:25:00.000Z	heizmann	brunner	yeah, but a script or a command like "curl blablabla" (cron would be suffer after that, because I'm regulary disconnected by the service)
2010-09-03T08:33:00.000Z	heizmann	brunner	sorry I was disconnected...
