2012-05-06T03:24:00.000Z	forgeaus		UGH! ubuntu booted me from sudoers when I tried setting a root password!
2012-05-06T03:25:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	forgeaus	you don't want to set a root password
2012-05-06T03:25:00.000Z	forgeaus	Fyodorovna	I wouldn't have needed it if this stupid policykit window didn't replace my kdesu one and keep asking for a root instead of sudo password
2012-05-06T03:26:00.000Z	forgeaus	Fyodorovna	erm maybe it ws kdesudo not kdesu lol
2012-05-06T03:26:00.000Z	forgeaus	Fyodorovna	my heads still back in edgy and feisty days sometimes :)
2012-05-06T03:26:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	forgeaus	never used kubuntu at least for more then about 5 minutes.
2012-05-06T03:27:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	forgeaus	lol it happens
2012-05-06T03:28:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	forgeaus	with a quick google og the policykit and kde I do see some bugs
2012-05-06T03:28:00.000Z	Fyodorovna		s/og/on
2012-05-06T03:28:00.000Z	forgeaus	Fyodorovna	doesn't matter, kdesudo (formerly kdesu but broke  with parallel kde3 and kde4 so kdesudo was made as a fix or something) anyway so kdesudo is just the kde version of gksu right? ...
2012-05-06T03:29:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	forgeaus	not sure I have not used it enough to know the commands
2012-05-06T03:29:00.000Z	forgeaus	Fyodorovna	yes but you do know gksu right?
2012-05-06T03:30:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	forgeaus	some what I use gksudo mainly
2012-05-06T03:30:00.000Z	forgeaus	Fyodorovna	oh ok gnome has a gksudo now too? I see.. ok well that one then ...either is fine!
2012-05-06T03:30:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	forgeaus	not real familiar with the differences really yeah.
2012-05-06T03:31:00.000Z	forgeaus	Fyodorovna	none of this helps me get my password back! ...
2012-05-06T03:32:00.000Z	forgeaus	Fyodorovna	I can't even sudo anymore! :(
2012-05-06T03:33:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	forgeaus	hmm, I will say that we are probably way beyond my skill set, I have some specialty areas mainly I'm just a user really.
