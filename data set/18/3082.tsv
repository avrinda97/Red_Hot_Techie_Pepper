2010-07-22T19:38:00.000Z	flupke		hello, where is the option to prevent pulseaudio from reloading automatically when killed ?
2010-07-22T19:38:00.000Z	Kwpolska	flupke	uninstall it
2010-07-22T19:39:00.000Z	flupke	Kwpolska	I don't want to uninstall it, I want to kill it to adjust alsa levels
2010-07-22T19:39:00.000Z	Kwpolska	flupke	remove ~/.pulse
2010-07-22T19:40:00.000Z	flupke	Kwpolska	removing a file to kill a daemon ?
2010-07-22T19:40:00.000Z	Kwpolska	flupke	yes
2010-07-22T19:40:00.000Z	flupke	Kwpolska	it doesn't kill anything.
2010-07-22T19:41:00.000Z	Kwpolska	flupke	and THEN kill it
2010-07-22T19:41:00.000Z	flupke	Kwpolska	it still reload
2010-07-22T19:41:00.000Z	Kwpolska	flupke	uninstall it, everyone knows that it sucks.
2010-07-22T19:43:00.000Z	flupke	Kwpolska	it may "suck" but at least it allows me to have more than one oss/broken alsa app playing at once
2010-07-22T19:43:00.000Z	Kwpolska	flupke	I dunno. when I kill it with sudo - I can use alsa-only.
2010-07-22T19:45:00.000Z	flupke	Kwpolska	ok, then if you don't know why do you give advice and rant about pulse sucking ?
2010-07-22T19:45:00.000Z	Kwpolska	flupke	I want to help you getting it out of your system
2010-07-22T19:46:00.000Z	flupke	Kwpolska	thank you but I don't want too, it may be broken but still is the only viable solution for flash and oss apps I know off
2010-07-22T19:48:00.000Z	flupke	Kwpolska	for later reference, to prevent pulseaudio from spawning again, put "autospawn = no" in /etc/pulse/client.conf
2010-07-22T19:48:00.000Z	Kwpolska	flupke	thanks.
2010-07-22T20:12:00.000Z	Kwpolska	flupke	some volume setts
