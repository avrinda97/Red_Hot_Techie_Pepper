2008-05-11T01:34:00.000Z	bardyr	wakka-wakka	sudo jockey-gtk
2008-05-11T01:35:00.000Z	wakka-wakka	bardyr	that just opens the hardward drivers section of administration, that driver wouldn't work.
2008-05-11T01:35:00.000Z	bardyr	wakka-wakka	it should work
2008-05-11T01:36:00.000Z	wakka-wakka	bardyr	nah it doesn't work.. maybe this might help, when i was on gutsy, i used this code 'dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg' and it gave me selections
2008-05-11T01:36:00.000Z	bardyr	wakka-wakka	the cmd will only reset X to default values
