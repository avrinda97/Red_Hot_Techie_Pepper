2006-05-02T08:55:00.000Z	steve343		dam it i should have tried that first
2006-05-02T08:55:00.000Z	_jason	steve343	what do you mean?
2006-05-11T10:20:00.000Z	_jason	steve343	can you paste the first line of /etc/hosts and /etc/hostname please?
2006-05-11T10:23:00.000Z	_jason	steve343	and /etc/hostname?
2006-05-11T10:23:00.000Z	_jason	steve343	pick a hostname for yourself
2006-05-11T10:24:00.000Z	_jason	steve343	that's ok, let's say you want your hostname to be 'steve', you would add it to the end of the first line in /etc/hosts and put it in /etc/hostname as well.  If sudo isn't working, just reboot in recovery mode and use 'nano'
2006-05-11T10:25:00.000Z	_jason	steve343	in /etc/hostname, you would put 'steve' by itself (not the same as /etc/hosts)
2006-05-11T10:26:00.000Z	_jason	steve343	reboot in recovery mode (it's a selection in the grub prompt)
2006-05-11T10:26:00.000Z	_jason	steve343	once there, you would use the editor 'nano', so you would do: nano /etc/hosts and then the same for /etc/hostname
2006-05-11T10:27:00.000Z	_jason	steve343	both, you need to make the /etc/hostname file contain 'steve' by itself.  Then you need to add 'steve' to the end of the first line in /etc/hosts that you pasted before
2006-05-11T10:31:00.000Z	_jason	steve343	what did you type exactly?
2006-05-11T10:32:00.000Z	_jason	steve343	both
2006-05-11T10:34:00.000Z	_jason	steve343	no you shouldn't need sudo
2006-05-11T10:34:00.000Z	_jason	steve343	f3 is equivalent to ^O right?
2006-05-11T10:36:00.000Z	_jason	steve343	hmm, you sure you put a / in front of the path when you opened nano?
2006-05-11T10:41:00.000Z	_jason	steve343	is sudo working now?
2006-05-11T10:42:00.000Z	_jason	steve343	hmm paste what the lines look like first
