2011-01-06T15:55:00.000Z	Anchor	Dwade09	Unlikely. Unless you have some incredibly advanced technology not available on the commercial market. Government stuff e.g.
2011-01-06T15:56:00.000Z	Dwade09	Anchor	 thank you
2011-01-06T15:56:00.000Z	Anchor	Dwade09	I wish I could be a better help.
2011-01-06T15:58:00.000Z	Dwade09	Anchor	 lucky i backed up home folder first.
2011-01-06T15:58:00.000Z	Anchor	Dwade09	Indeed.
2011-01-06T15:59:00.000Z	Dwade09	Anchor	 i ask you something?
2011-01-06T15:59:00.000Z	Anchor	Dwade09	Sure.
2011-01-06T16:00:00.000Z	Dwade09	Anchor	 im at the install and it shows /dev/sda1 fat 32 248gb then it shows my linuxmint /dev/sda2 ext 4 251gb on my hard drive.
2011-01-06T16:01:00.000Z	Dwade09	Anchor	 so does that mean it is still there?
2011-01-06T16:01:00.000Z	Anchor	Dwade09	Have you tried browsing through the folders to see if any files exist?
2011-01-06T16:02:00.000Z	Dwade09	Anchor	 i cd'd into it but said not there
2011-01-06T16:02:00.000Z	Anchor	Dwade09	Yeah, doesn't exist. I don't know how to refresh it through. I'm new to Ubuntu.
2011-01-06T16:02:00.000Z	Dwade09	Anchor	 bash: cd: /dev/sda2: No such file or directory
2011-01-06T16:18:00.000Z	Anchor	Dwade09	You're good. I'm sorry I couldn't be more helpful.
2011-01-06T16:20:00.000Z	Dwade09	Anchor	 this is the fun part is installing it and having it download packages as it installs. =p
2011-01-06T16:27:00.000Z	Dwade09	Anchor	 there is man crontab once you have it installed.
2011-01-06T16:27:00.000Z	Anchor	Dwade09	thanks.
