2005-07-02T08:33:00.000Z	NoSoundProblem		why do people leave there computers on over night for?
2005-07-02T08:33:00.000Z	NoSoundProblem		some people just leave it on with IRC
2005-07-02T08:34:00.000Z	CarlFK	NoSoundProblem	- cuz turning on/off a computer puts more wear on it than letting it run for 12 hours (maybe)
2005-07-02T08:35:00.000Z	NoSoundProblem	CarlFK	more wear?
2005-07-02T08:35:00.000Z	NoSoundProblem	CarlFK	waste of electricity
2005-07-02T08:36:00.000Z	CarlFK	NoSoundProblem	- mainly being turned on.  the power is very dirty at first, it puts extra "stress" on the parts
2005-07-02T08:36:00.000Z	NoSoundProblem	CarlFK	lol
2005-07-02T08:37:00.000Z	NoSoundProblem	CarlFK	is there any way to turn it down so much so it uses the leasest amount of electricity?
2005-07-02T08:38:00.000Z	NoSoundProblem	CarlFK	hibernation mode?
2005-07-02T08:38:00.000Z	CarlFK	NoSoundProblem	- yes- there are a bunch of places: vga gets a suspend command, the drive moter can be turned off, a P4 cpu can be slowed down, some powersupplies can even slow down the fan
2005-07-02T08:39:00.000Z	NoSoundProblem	CarlFK	cool but its getting too late to figgure how to do that
2005-07-02T08:39:00.000Z	CarlFK	NoSoundProblem	- here is my take:...
2005-07-02T08:39:00.000Z	NoSoundProblem	CarlFK	what do you mean bunch of places?
2005-07-02T08:40:00.000Z	CarlFK	NoSoundProblem	- many: drive, monitor, fan, disk, cpu
2005-07-02T08:41:00.000Z	CarlFK	NoSoundProblem	- probably, but I don't know of one
2005-07-02T08:43:00.000Z	NoSoundProblem	CarlFK	where do programs get installed?
2005-07-02T08:46:00.000Z	CarlFK	NoSoundProblem	- if you are half dead, get some sleep
