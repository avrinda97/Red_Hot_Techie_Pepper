2006-06-13T05:34:00.000Z	orbin	ubuntunewbie	what did you to cause it?
2006-06-13T05:51:00.000Z	orbin	ubuntunewbie	according to the official wiki: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia
2006-06-13T05:42:00.000Z	orbin	ubuntunewbie	which 'wrong ones' did you install?  and how?
2006-06-13T05:44:00.000Z	ubuntunewbie	orbin	so I installed them via the package manager
2006-06-13T05:45:00.000Z	orbin	ubuntunewbie	sudo apt-get removenvidia-glx-legacy
2006-06-13T05:46:00.000Z	orbin	ubuntunewbie	that will uninstall the legacy ones.  then you can grab the normal nvidia-glx package
2006-06-13T05:46:00.000Z	ubuntunewbie	orbin	and i can do that via "sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx nvidia-kernel-common", right?
2006-06-13T05:47:00.000Z	orbin	ubuntunewbie	i catually have an ati card.  where are you getting that kernel-common from? the wiki only says you need the glx package
2006-06-13T05:47:00.000Z	ubuntunewbie	orbin	and, I also installed nvidia-settings
2006-06-13T05:48:00.000Z	ubuntunewbie	orbin	ehmmm, i read it on this site...
2006-06-13T05:48:00.000Z	orbin	ubuntunewbie	are you on dapper?
2006-06-13T05:49:00.000Z	ubuntunewbie	orbin	dapper, yes
2006-06-13T05:49:00.000Z	ubuntunewbie	orbin	i found it here: http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Dapper
2006-06-13T05:50:00.000Z	ubuntunewbie	orbin	i'll just try this and see if it works :)
2006-06-13T05:50:00.000Z	orbin	ubuntunewbie	grab those two then....installing nvidia-settings in dapper removes the nvidia-glx package...maybe that's why it failed
2006-06-13T06:57:00.000Z	ubuntunewbie	orbin	everything worked out fine (after some trouble) with nvidia
2006-06-13T06:58:00.000Z	orbin	ubuntunewbie	great
2006-06-13T06:58:00.000Z	ubuntunewbie	orbin	and my drives are correctly mounted too... thanks!
