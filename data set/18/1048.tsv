2011-06-20T00:24:00.000Z	Kayne_		I hope that worked
2011-06-20T00:25:00.000Z	Kayne_		<usr13> did that work?
2011-06-20T00:27:00.000Z	Kayne_		no, i think the FAT32 is the usb stick where Ubuntu is running from  and the other one is the partioned HD with My Windows 7 OS  the last one is not showing up.
2011-06-20T00:27:00.000Z	Kayne_		even though when i rund fdisk, or unplug the drive  and turn it on, The drive reads because the light blinks
2011-06-20T00:28:00.000Z	Kayne_		yes. the 16 gig drive has linux on it
2011-06-20T00:28:00.000Z	Kayne_		it is how linux got on to this computer
2011-06-20T00:28:00.000Z	Kayne_		otherwise it would just be windows ,
2011-06-20T00:30:00.000Z	Kayne_		The 16 gig FAT Drive is not the one I want , nor is the 1.5 TB drive  there is a 80 gig drive i am trying to access, That is why i was trying to use testdisk, but i can't seem to get it to run.

If you have a local Linux User Group nearby, I'd suggest contacting them, there's going to be at least one helpful person who will handle this for a beer and a "thanks" without much effort, or at least confirm that the problem requires professional data recovery services
2011-06-20T00:35:00.000Z	enleth	Kayne_	that might be a very stupid question, but is the testdisk version you have the correct one? Linux, architecture (32bit or 64bit) matching the system you have installed.
2011-06-20T00:36:00.000Z	enleth	Kayne_	wols asked the right question - was it installed using apt? It should be available there
2011-06-20T00:38:00.000Z	enleth	Kayne_	nah, that's not the right way. Discard whatever you might have installed and run sudo apt-get install testdisk
2011-06-20T00:38:00.000Z	enleth	Kayne_	if it still doesn't work, then we have a problem
2011-06-20T00:39:00.000Z	enleth	Kayne_	those read errors for sdc are the disk you're trying to read data from?
2011-06-20T00:40:00.000Z	enleth	Kayne_	that's the point where I usually unplug the thing and estimate wether the data stored on it is worth the $500 and up it costs to recover it
2011-06-20T00:41:00.000Z	enleth	Kayne_	trying to do anything with a disk that has hardware problems is a bad idea. VERY bad idea. No, I'm not employed by a data recovery company.
