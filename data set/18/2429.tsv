2012-08-16T04:49:00.000Z	TJ-	harris	Are you using regular Ubuntu 12.04 desktop?
2012-08-16T04:50:00.000Z	TJ-	harris	You can reinstall all the desktop packages with something like "sudo apt-get --reinstall ubuntu-desktop" ... BEFORE you do that, let ActionParsnip and Dr_Willis confirm what I have said

2012-08-17T03:33:00.000Z	harris	TJ-	 are you saying tjat to me
2012-08-17T03:48:00.000Z	TJ-	harris	That is normally an option in the BIOS menus
