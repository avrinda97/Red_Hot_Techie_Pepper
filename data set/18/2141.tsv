2010-09-21T11:03:00.000Z	coafcv		Hey. My last security update failed, how can I repeat it?
2010-09-21T11:04:00.000Z	Flannel	coafcv	Fire up your favorite package manager and do an upgrade
2010-09-21T11:05:00.000Z	coafcv	Flannel	how would I do this with e.g. synaptic package manager? I clicked on "mark all upgrades" there, but no packages are selected.
2010-09-21T11:07:00.000Z	coafcv	Flannel	?
2010-09-21T11:08:00.000Z	Flannel	coafcv	Do a "refresh" and then "mark all upgrades", yes.
2010-09-21T11:08:00.000Z	Flannel	coafcv	If nothing is marked after that, then you're up to date.
2010-09-21T11:08:00.000Z	coafcv	Flannel	I did and nothing is marked, but how can I be up to date, if the last update gave me like a dozen errors.
2010-09-21T11:08:00.000Z	coafcv	Flannel	I do not want to have a gaping security hole in my system.
2010-09-21T11:09:00.000Z	Flannel	coafcv	Go to a terminal, and run these commands, and pastebin the output (paste.ubuntu.com): sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
2010-09-21T11:14:00.000Z	coafcv	Flannel	http://paste.ubuntu.com/497513/ ... here ( http://paste.ubuntu.com/497515/ ) is also my last entry in /var/log/apt/term.log, which gave those errors. it has a problem with fglrx, which is weird because 1) I do not use fglrx anymore, 2) the update had nothing to do with fglrx.
2010-09-21T11:17:00.000Z	Flannel	coafcv	In that case, I'd remove your fglrx packages
2010-09-21T11:17:00.000Z	coafcv	Flannel	sudo apt-get purge fglrx* ?
2010-09-21T11:18:00.000Z	Flannel	coafcv	That'll work, yeah.
2010-09-21T11:18:00.000Z	coafcv	Flannel	okay, I'll do this. but is there still a way for me to "redo" this failed update? I somehow fear that the update has not been installed properly and the security fix hasn't been applied.
2010-09-21T11:19:00.000Z	coafcv	Flannel	it's been like 3 security patches.
2010-09-21T11:20:00.000Z	Flannel	coafcv	The only failed updates from that seem to be the fglrx packages, likely because you had a kernel update somewhere along the lines.  It's nothing to worry about, as your packages are all up to date currently.
2010-09-21T11:20:00.000Z	coafcv	Flannel	hnm ok
2010-09-21T11:20:00.000Z	coafcv	Flannel	thanks
