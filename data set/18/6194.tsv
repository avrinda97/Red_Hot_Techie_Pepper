2008-06-25T17:21:00.000Z	jonny_		How can i migrate my settings for pidgin, xchat-gnome and epiphany from mandriva to ubuntu
2008-06-25T17:21:00.000Z	philh	jonny_	backup the .program name directories from your home directory
2008-06-25T17:23:00.000Z	jonny_	philh	I copied the directories .purple .gnome2/epiphany and .xchat-gnome to my ubuntu-home. Then i set permissions according to standards (ubuntuuser:ubuntuser and chmod 770) but it does not work
2008-06-25T17:25:00.000Z	philh	jonny_	none of the programs noticed at all?
2008-06-25T17:26:00.000Z	jonny_	philh	I shutdown all programs before i did this, but none of these even dared to use the changed files
2008-06-25T17:26:00.000Z	philh	jonny_	where exactly did you put the files
2008-06-25T17:26:00.000Z	jonny_	philh	Strange enough, the files did not change after restarting said programms, any idea?
2008-06-25T17:28:00.000Z	jonny_	philh	i copied them from /mdv/home/jonny into /home/jonny because both users have the same username but not the same UID, so i had to copy them as root.
2008-06-25T17:29:00.000Z	jonny_	philh	Afterwards i issued commands: chown -R jonny:jonny /home/jonny and chmod -R 770 /home/jonny
2008-06-25T17:32:00.000Z	philh	jonny_	that is odd, if you start pidgin and configure an account what happens to the files you copied in?
2008-06-25T17:39:00.000Z	jonny_	philh	I checked it out now. The old file gets deleted. But the permissions on the new file are exactly the same. So is the version of pidgin in Mandriva and Ubuntu
2008-06-25T17:39:00.000Z	philh	jonny_	well, pidgin uses XML for config files so it should be fairly straightforward to create the config files and then copy and paste your old setup into them
2008-06-25T17:41:00.000Z	jonny_	philh	Maybe i am being tricked. I just deleted the new config and recopied the migrated one, it now works. This is really kinda odd
2008-06-25T17:41:00.000Z	philh	jonny_	hmmm, indeed it is
2008-06-25T17:41:00.000Z	philh	jonny_	maybe pidgin wrote something to gconf when you created the account and is not looking in the right place for your data
2008-06-25T17:43:00.000Z	jonny_	philh	i try to at least change a bit in the configurations of each program, then i'll try backing up and migrate the files from mandriva once again. thx for help, good bye
2008-06-25T17:43:00.000Z	philh	jonny_	ok, good luck, sorry i couldn't help more
2008-06-25T17:44:00.000Z	jonny_	philh	No problem, i'll come back with more questions later :)
