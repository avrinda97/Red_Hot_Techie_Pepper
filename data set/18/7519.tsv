2007-12-26T15:17:00.000Z	rodgrech		thats what comes up
2007-12-26T15:18:00.000Z	rodgrech		if i get it working under the live cd, and then hit install. will the modifications transfer across
2007-12-26T15:18:00.000Z	rodgrech		or would that make sence
2007-12-26T15:19:00.000Z	rodgrech		gah ok... well in that case, ill take the plunge then come back in here and reget that link
2007-12-26T15:19:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	rodgrech	that what i would do, are you going to dual boot?
2007-12-26T15:14:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	rodgrech	what problem are you having?
2007-12-26T15:14:00.000Z	rodgrech	IndyGunFreak	well im using the live cd atm to test it, but it seems not to detect the audio device
2007-12-26T15:15:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	rodgrech	open a terminal and type "lspci" then enter, and see how it identifies your sound device.
2007-12-26T15:17:00.000Z	rodgrech	IndyGunFreak	00:1b.0 Audio device: Intel Corporation 82801G (ICH7 Family) High Definition Audio Controller (rev 02)
2007-12-26T15:18:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	rodgrech	i've had moderate success getting intelhda to work w/ the instructions at that link, but unfortunately, you can't run them till your installed.
2007-12-26T15:18:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	rodgrech	ther's to much to do there to do on the live CD, not to mention it requires a couple restarts
2007-12-26T15:22:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	rodgrech	well, god luck w/ it.
2007-12-26T15:27:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	rodgrech	yes. i would think so...
2007-12-26T15:28:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	rodgrech	how much ram do you have?
2007-12-26T15:28:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	rodgrech	rule of thumb for swap, 1.5-2x your ram
2007-12-26T15:29:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	rodgrech	yeah, thats just a rule of thumb, i usually let the installer setup my partitions, and it usually sets me at 4gig swap, and 240gig /
