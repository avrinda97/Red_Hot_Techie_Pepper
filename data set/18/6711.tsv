2008-04-06T12:54:00.000Z	syncrondi		so is this just a big fre for all?
2008-04-06T12:54:00.000Z	n2diy	syncrondi	no, ops are lurkiing, otherwise, yes.
2008-04-06T13:00:00.000Z	n2diy	syncrondi	check that they belong to the proper group, and are in the group
2008-04-06T13:03:00.000Z	syncrondi	n2diy	$groups shows that they are all in the same group with no other group memberships
2008-04-06T13:04:00.000Z	n2diy	syncrondi	do they have group permission?
2008-04-06T13:06:00.000Z	syncrondi	n2diy	group is based from root, I've not set any specific permissions. One of the users can't WinSCP files to our home folder, but if he logs on as my user, he is able to
2008-04-06T13:08:00.000Z	n2diy	syncrondi	what are the three permission groups? don't cheat, tell me now.
2008-04-06T13:08:00.000Z	syncrondi	n2diy	rwx
2008-04-06T13:09:00.000Z	n2diy	syncrondi	no that is only a third of it, rwxrwxrwx. Why are there three of the groups?
2008-04-06T13:11:00.000Z	syncrondi	n2diy	I understand permissions, but I don't understand why one user would not be able to copy a file to their home folder
2008-04-06T13:12:00.000Z	n2diy	syncrondi	sorry, but I'm not sure you do, and that is what I'm trying to establish. Why do have rwx repeat three times?
2008-04-06T13:13:00.000Z	syncrondi	n2diy	It's simple if you must know. It must establish permissions on the file for the owner, group, and all
2008-04-06T13:14:00.000Z	n2diy	syncrondi	good, you understand.
2008-04-06T13:14:00.000Z	syncrondi	n2diy	thanks for the credit :)
2008-04-06T13:16:00.000Z	n2diy	syncrondi	So if root own the file only he can use his permission on it. And if the group has permissions they can too. and some individuals may or may not, and some groups may or may not. I think you need to check your permissions and groups etc...
2008-04-06T13:25:00.000Z	syncrondi	n2diy	thanks for your help. I think I see the problem
2008-04-06T13:25:00.000Z	n2diy	syncrondi	and???
2008-04-06T13:26:00.000Z	n2diy	syncrondi	roger, GL
