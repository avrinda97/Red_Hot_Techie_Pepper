2011-06-29T03:13:00.000Z	frank_		hi
2011-06-29T03:14:00.000Z	frank_		can someone help me interpret the output of smartctl? Looks like /dev/urandom to me that has been put through a formater that inserts some tabs :)
2011-06-29T03:15:00.000Z	valdyn	frank_	read the specs or try gsmartmontool
2011-06-29T03:15:00.000Z	frank_	valdyn	I wouldn't ask if i didnt already tried to understand the output
2011-06-29T03:15:00.000Z	valdyn	frank_	you can ask specific things
2011-06-29T03:16:00.000Z	frank_	valdyn	is this disk failing? http://nopaste.info/e4889e6723.html
2011-06-29T03:16:00.000Z	frank_		:)
2011-06-29T03:16:00.000Z	valdyn	frank_	but its all on the spec, and in googles hd statistics
2011-06-29T03:16:00.000Z	valdyn	frank_	can you see all tests completing with no error?
2011-06-29T03:17:00.000Z	frank_	valdyn	I don't see any tests ("not_testing")
2011-06-29T03:18:00.000Z	valdyn	frank_	test was done at some point in the past
2011-06-29T03:18:00.000Z	valdyn	frank_	its failing a few times on powerup. If thats happening ever time thats bad, if its not happening again thats not a problem
2011-06-29T03:19:00.000Z	valdyn	frank_	s.m.a.r.t. isnt really smart, its just showing whats happening
2011-06-29T03:20:00.000Z	frank_	valdyn	ok thanks. I think it's not reliable anymore. I see this messages in dmesg: http://nopaste.info/ffa2d75427.html
2011-06-29T03:20:00.000Z	valdyn	frank_	thats a result of one such powerup error I assume
2011-06-29T03:21:00.000Z	valdyn	frank_	now, you wouldnt really need smart to detect this error
2011-06-29T03:21:00.000Z	valdyn	frank_	but thats how it is..
2011-06-29T03:23:00.000Z	frank_	valdyn	sure. I'm looking for a OS drive for my nexenta, since this drive hasn't to  be big I tried drives from my old media center pc, that's the background
