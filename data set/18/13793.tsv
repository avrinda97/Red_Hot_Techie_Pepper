2006-05-12T16:58:00.000Z	luke		for some reason when I boot Gnome it still says "Dapper Beta". Ive done sudo apt-get update/upgrade. is there anything else Im missing?
2006-05-12T16:59:00.000Z	luke		oh.. right lol ty
2006-05-12T09:10:00.000Z	luke		should I use OpenOffice.org or OpenOffice.org2?
2006-05-12T09:11:00.000Z	luke		sivik: how do i uninstall oo2. sudo apt-get remove openoffice.org2?
2006-05-12T09:11:00.000Z	luke		how do I install something with all it's dependencies automatically?
2006-05-12T09:12:00.000Z	mustard5	luke	apt-get normally doest that..are you using dpkg?
2006-05-12T09:13:00.000Z	luke	mustard5	I tried sudo apt-get install openoffice.org2 "The following packages have unmet dependencies:\n openoffice.org: Conflicts: openoffice.org2"
2006-05-12T09:15:00.000Z	mustard5	luke	you tried apt-get -f install ?
2006-05-12T09:15:00.000Z	luke	mustard5	I think the problem was you cant have oo1 and oo2 installed at the same time
2006-05-12T09:16:00.000Z	mustard5	luke	k
2006-05-13T14:36:00.000Z	mustard5	luke	I think it just installs to a folder in the $HOME directory doesnt it?
2006-05-13T14:38:00.000Z	mustard5	luke	it might be as simple as deleting the folder its in.
2006-05-13T14:38:00.000Z	luke	mustard5	find / -name et returns a lot of different files scattered around the system
2006-05-13T14:39:00.000Z	mustard5	luke	hmm ok...I dont know then :)
2006-05-13T14:40:00.000Z	mustard5	luke	another idea...I wonder if you can run the .bin file with some type of uninstall option
2006-05-13T14:40:00.000Z	mustard5	luke	you looked over the website?
2006-05-13T14:41:00.000Z	mustard5	luke	does it have any readme files in its main folder?
2006-05-13T14:43:00.000Z	luke	mustard5	wendigo, thanks guys - taking a look into ur advice atm
