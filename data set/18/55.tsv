2012-10-29T09:25:00.000Z	Fudge		anyone experienced their w/nic's prompting for wireless password again and again without connecting?
2012-10-29T09:25:00.000Z	Fudge		why not just install xfce4-desktop or what eve rthe metapackage is called and tell lightdm to use that session
2012-10-29T09:25:00.000Z	dougbb	Fudge	are you 10000000% sure the password is right?
2012-10-29T09:26:00.000Z	Fudge		yep 100% positive, this is really giving me greif
2012-10-29T09:26:00.000Z	dougbb		xfce++ :)
2012-10-29T09:26:00.000Z	Fudge	Coburn	 you mean reboot modem?
2012-10-29T09:26:00.000Z	dougbb	Fudge	ok, then do what Coburn said :)
2012-10-29T09:27:00.000Z	dougbb	Fudge	if you have control over the ap, try removing the security temporarily to see if it connects at all
2012-10-29T09:27:00.000Z	Fudge		good ideas, yep fn f2 will diable/enable thanks
2012-10-29T09:30:00.000Z	Fudge		well guys, with security disabled it connects
2012-10-29T09:31:00.000Z	Fudge		I guess enable and try again?
2012-10-29T09:31:00.000Z	Fudge		also the wireless filter was still set on allowed mac addresses so that is now disabled, that may help
2012-10-29T09:32:00.000Z	Fudge		wpa2
2012-10-29T09:33:00.000Z	Fudge		Erin  I have an old ibook that doesnt like wpa or even wep
2012-10-29T09:34:00.000Z	dougbb		wpa2 with AES is about the best you can do nowadays
2012-10-29T09:34:00.000Z	dougbb		wep is a joke :)
2012-10-29T09:35:00.000Z	Fudge		ok its fixed woohooo
2012-10-29T09:35:00.000Z	dougbb	Fudge	:)
