2008-07-26T11:16:00.000Z	Vegombrei		what is 64 Studio 2.0 VMWare Virtual Machine .. can i use this software to boot another operating system virtually ?
2008-07-26T11:17:00.000Z	nickrud	Vegombrei	based on the name, I'd guess it's an image of ubuntu studio you can run inside of vmware
2008-07-26T11:18:00.000Z	Vegombrei	nickrud	i have xp on a completely different hdd . can i boot that ?
2008-07-26T11:19:00.000Z	nickrud	Vegombrei	depending on where the disk is physically connected to the machine, you may have to massage ubuntu
2008-07-26T11:23:00.000Z	Vegombrei	nickrud	i have 2 hdd's .. one 250 which has ubuntu .. and the other 80 gb .. that one has windows .. i only use windows coz of some gadgets like cameras and stuff that need windows for its software .. so it be great if i can run windows virtually .. that way i'll never hafta reboot and boot thru windows
2008-07-26T11:23:00.000Z	nickrud	Vegombrei	there's a way to use vmware to run the windows partition directly, but I've never used it myself. Don't know much about it.
2008-07-26T11:24:00.000Z	Vegombrei	nickrud	yeah .. lots of people told me i could make a mess if i didnt know exactly what to do ..
2008-07-26T11:24:00.000Z	nickrud	Vegombrei	sounds possible :)
2008-07-26T11:29:00.000Z	nickrud	Vegombrei	you have more than one package manager open most likely
2008-07-26T11:30:00.000Z	Vegombrei	nickrud	nope .. just the one
2008-07-26T11:30:00.000Z	Vegombrei	nickrud	its the update thingie
2008-07-26T11:31:00.000Z	nickrud	Vegombrei	make sure ... I'd log out completely if you're not sure what else to look for
2008-07-26T11:32:00.000Z	Vegombrei	nickrud	dude its the update thing .. i click on update .. and thats the msg i get
2008-07-26T11:32:00.000Z	nickrud	Vegombrei	I understand ... do you have synaptic, adept, apt running, anything?
2008-07-26T11:35:00.000Z	Vegombrei	nickrud	nada .. nothing running
2008-07-26T11:35:00.000Z	nickrud	Vegombrei	ok, try logging out completely, and back in. Just to be sure there's no stray process.
2008-07-26T11:36:00.000Z	nickrud	Vegombrei	before you do that, try  ps -A | grep apt
2008-07-26T11:39:00.000Z	Vegombrei	nickrud	yep .. that worked .. thanks
