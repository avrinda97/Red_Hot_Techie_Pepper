2009-06-30T04:41:00.000Z	MaT-dg		how can I open irc links in firefox with xchat?
2009-06-30T04:42:00.000Z	tsrk	MaT-dg	right click and click open in browser
2009-06-30T04:43:00.000Z	MaT-dg	tsrk	I mean the other way, a link in firefox (irc://...) and clicking on it opens xchat (or other irc client)
2009-06-30T04:43:00.000Z	tsrk	MaT-dg	oh, um, no idea sorry. I'll see if I can find it on google (nothing better to do now)
2009-06-30T04:43:00.000Z	MaT-dg	tsrk	thx ^^

2009-06-30T04:48:00.000Z	tsrk	MaT-dg	oh did you already solve it?
2009-06-30T04:50:00.000Z	MaT-dg	tsrk	mobi-sheep: In firefox I changed something (thought it was the handler for irc), edit > preferences > applications, and pointed content type 'irc' to usr/bin/xchat. Now it opens xchat without connecting to the server and joining the channel, de command from mobi-sheep had no effect on that behaviour
2009-06-30T04:51:00.000Z	tsrk	MaT-dg	1 sec, i'll find my settings for that (which seem to be working)
2009-06-30T04:53:00.000Z	tsrk	MaT-dg	go back there and set it to "always ask" and open an irc link. Then it will give you the correct xchat option, and you can check the box to always use xchat and it should work.
2009-06-30T04:55:00.000Z	tsrk	MaT-dg	did you try what i said?
2009-06-30T04:55:00.000Z	MaT-dg	tsrk	doing atm
2009-06-30T04:57:00.000Z	MaT-dg	tsrk	it ask me what program I want to use but it doesn't give me other options, just opens xchat without connecting and joining the channel again..
2009-06-30T04:57:00.000Z	tsrk	MaT-dg	ok, 1 moment, i'll look at my "xchat" option and see what it's really doing
2009-06-30T04:59:00.000Z	tsrk	MaT-dg	sorry, i can't seem to find a way to see what it's doing
2009-06-30T05:02:00.000Z	MaT-dg	tsrk	no problem, I appreciate your effort :)
2009-06-30T05:03:00.000Z	tsrk	MaT-dg	the only sure way I can think of is exporting the important options from firefox (bookmarks etc) and resetting all the firefox settings and importing the stuff you want
2009-06-30T05:03:00.000Z	tsrk	MaT-dg	i'm sure there's an easier way but i can't say what it is
