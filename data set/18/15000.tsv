2005-05-23T11:10:00.000Z	Thirsteh		Is anyone here using a webcam in Linux?
2005-05-23T11:11:00.000Z	Thirsteh		Well, I wouldn't if it wasn't cus my fiancee lives far away and it's kinda a necessity
2005-05-23T11:11:00.000Z	Thirsteh		So I need to get something working here
2005-05-23T11:11:00.000Z	Thirsteh		and I don't wanna be forced to install Windows to use one
2005-05-23T11:11:00.000Z	dabaSlon	Thirsteh	well, you likely will not get that camera you have working, sorry to break your hopes/...
2005-05-23T11:11:00.000Z	dabaSlon	Thirsteh	um, there is a page on the wiki abnout webcams.
2005-05-23T11:11:00.000Z	Thirsteh	dabaSlon	I know, I was more curious to find out which cam actually works
2005-05-23T11:12:00.000Z	Thirsteh	dabaSlon	okay I'll check it out, thanks
2005-05-23T11:12:00.000Z	Thirsteh	dabaSlon	you know a cam that works in Ubuntu?
2005-05-23T11:13:00.000Z	Thirsteh	dabaSlon	ok, thanks
2005-05-23T11:13:00.000Z	Thirsteh	dabaSlon	I found it, thanks though :)
2005-05-23T11:31:00.000Z	Thirsteh	dabaSlon	on the page, the camera driver page says the drivers (for linux) also supports Sony Eyetoy for PS2, that's actually the cam I've got now
2005-05-23T11:31:00.000Z	Thirsteh	dabaSlon	I haven't tried it out though cause having it plugged would screw up my ALSA settings (because it has a built-in microphone)
2005-05-23T11:32:00.000Z	dabaSlon	Thirsteh	sweet deal:)
2005-05-23T11:32:00.000Z	Thirsteh	dabaSlon	happen to have any experience with USB mics screwing up ALSA? :\
2005-05-23T11:33:00.000Z	dabaSlon	Thirsteh	no, not at all...just said thats a sweet deal that yours is supported/
2005-05-23T11:33:00.000Z	Thirsteh	dabaSlon	alright, I'll try to make it work...
2005-05-23T11:33:00.000Z	Thirsteh	dabaSlon	thanks for the help :)
