2008-04-20T07:38:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	NateF	are you having trouble getting the livecd to boot.. if so what have you tried
2008-04-20T07:39:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	NateF	you get the first menu just not the desktop and the install icon?
2008-04-20T07:39:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	NateF	At start or install press F6 and remove Quiet and Splash from the command line. If it still fails.. Repeat and after removing quiet and splash add noapic acpi=off before the "--"
2008-04-20T07:40:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	NateF	When you click the install icon on the desktop or select install from the first srat or install menu
2008-04-20T07:44:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	NateF	F6 at the first start or install menu.. use the delete key
2008-04-20T07:47:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	NateF	with quiet removed did you see the error or place where it hung up
2008-04-20T07:47:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	NateF	with quiet removed did you see the error or place where it hung up
