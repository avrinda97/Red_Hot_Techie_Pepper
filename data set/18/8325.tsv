2007-09-19T10:52:00.000Z	dystopianray	leladia	unless you want to edit /etc/passwd don't use vipw
2007-09-19T10:52:00.000Z	dystopianray	leladia	and only root can use vipw
2007-09-19T10:52:00.000Z	leladia	dystopianray	 thanks
2007-09-19T10:57:00.000Z	dystopianray	leladia	awk is a command
2007-09-19T12:20:00.000Z	dystopianray	leladia	there isn't one by default
2007-09-19T12:21:00.000Z	dystopianray	leladia	there may be one in /etc/skel/
2007-09-20T10:23:00.000Z	dystopianray	leladia	you need to enter your remote account password
2007-09-20T10:23:00.000Z	dystopianray	leladia	only you know this password
