2008-03-15T18:48:00.000Z	kris_ph		I just read an article saying that lighttpd is better in terms of performance and speed than apache2.. So my question is.. is lighthttpd supported by ubuntu?
2008-03-15T18:48:00.000Z	linxeh	kris_ph	are you serving something like digg then ?
2008-03-15T18:49:00.000Z	linxeh	kris_ph	but yes, its supported as in there are packages for it
2008-03-15T18:51:00.000Z	kris_ph	linxeh	thanks... amenado, can't get your point
2008-03-15T18:52:00.000Z	linxeh	kris_ph	its a universe package i think. do you really think you need lighttpd over apache ?
2008-03-15T18:53:00.000Z	kris_ph	linxeh	mmm... just so curious about this issue.. what do you think?
2008-03-15T18:54:00.000Z	linxeh	kris_ph	unless you are specifically having problems I would use apache. if you are having problems, then you'll need to be doing more than just looking at the webserver - for most people the overheads are in the applicatiosn they host on the server, not the server itself
2008-03-15T18:57:00.000Z	linxeh	kris_ph	you wont be able to measure it on a small site, and its hard to measure it on most typically larger sites too in my experience
2008-03-15T18:58:00.000Z	kris_ph	linxeh	experience is a best teacher.. have you tried both in different environment.. right? small site and larger ones?
2008-03-15T18:59:00.000Z	linxeh	kris_ph	if your cpu is sat 99% idle there is not much point in making life hard for yourself. we use lighttpd internally at work on one of our servers for serving up images, everything else is apache
2008-03-15T18:59:00.000Z	linxeh	kris_ph	those are small-medium sites (10,000+ hits per day)
2008-03-15T19:00:00.000Z	linxeh	kris_ph	but hosting webapps as opposed to just simple news pages - some of them serve web mapping to things like nasa worldwind
2008-03-15T19:00:00.000Z	kris_ph	linxeh	uhuh! interesting..
2008-03-15T19:00:00.000Z	linxeh	kris_ph	what are you hosting? just something for your own use on a lan ?
2008-03-15T19:01:00.000Z	kris_ph	linxeh	company website with gallery2
2008-03-15T19:03:00.000Z	linxeh	kris_ph	I wouldn't waste your time with lighttpd - by all means try it out for your own experience
2008-03-15T19:03:00.000Z	linxeh	kris_ph	most people run apache, and thats what you'll find the most guides for. if something needs lighttpd you can run that too
2008-03-15T19:04:00.000Z	kris_ph	linxeh	now.. can these two run on the same box simultaneously?
