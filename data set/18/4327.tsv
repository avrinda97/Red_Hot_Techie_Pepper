2009-12-22T10:52:00.000Z	severity1		shutdown -r now
2009-12-22T10:53:00.000Z	TangentCollision	severity1	that's what the command reboot does, is it not?
2009-12-22T10:53:00.000Z	TangentCollision		init 6
2009-12-22T10:53:00.000Z	severity1	TangentCollision	yeah
2009-12-22T10:54:00.000Z	TangentCollision		the reason I ask is because I'm getting a hang on reboot at "saving the system clock"
2009-12-22T10:54:00.000Z	TangentCollision		I know how to reboot ubuntu, I'm asking how to FORCE
2009-12-22T10:54:00.000Z	TangentCollision		as in no confirmations
2009-12-22T10:55:00.000Z	severity1		is your system time showing the correct time?
2009-12-22T10:55:00.000Z	severity1		press the powerbutton for 5 secs.
2009-12-22T10:56:00.000Z	TangentCollision	severity1	to answer your question, it's a server, I want to reboot remotely, and "reboot -f" works
2009-12-22T10:56:00.000Z	severity1		hahaha
2009-12-22T10:56:00.000Z	severity1		but it hangs during reboot?
2009-12-22T10:56:00.000Z	TangentCollision		yeah
2009-12-22T10:56:00.000Z	TangentCollision		it hangs during normal reboot
2009-12-22T10:56:00.000Z	severity1		cbecause of system time error?
2009-12-22T10:56:00.000Z	TangentCollision		because of saving system clock
2009-12-22T10:57:00.000Z	severity1		have you checked the bios
2009-12-22T10:57:00.000Z	TangentCollision	severity1	to answer your question, it's a server, I want to reboot remotely, and "reboot -f" works
