2009-12-29T10:06:00.000Z	slinkeey		Hello -- I have something that is going to sound stupid..  I have two of the same notebook computers.  One runs XP and the other Ubuntu 9.10.. For some reason the one running ubuntu 9.10 gets a low wireless signal.   I thought maybe it was hardware so I swapped hard drives between the two (Same exact hardware) and no atter what, the one running XP gets a more reliable wireless signal.
2009-12-29T10:07:00.000Z	slinkeey		Do you think an OS has anything to do with signal strength though??
2009-12-29T10:07:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	slinkeey	Check if your notebook turned up.  Something things get wired backward and require little configurations.
2009-12-29T10:11:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	slinkeey	What netbook make/model?
2009-12-29T10:13:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	slinkeey	Run "sudo lshw -c network" and paste it.
2009-12-29T10:22:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	slinkeey	Have you tried the backport modules?
2009-12-29T10:23:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	slinkeey	Okay. Try this. "sudo aptitude install linux-backports-modules-karmic" -- When it's finished, reboot and come back.  Your wifi should be working fine without any dropped connections.
2009-12-29T10:29:00.000Z	slinkeey	kinja-sheep	I am reading this now... https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuBackports
2009-12-29T10:34:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	slinkeey	No problem. Next time you have problem, look up on your wifi card.  You have AR928X. :)
2009-12-29T10:36:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	slinkeey	That way, I can read highlighted messages easily.
2009-12-29T10:37:00.000Z	slinkeey	kinja-sheep	Thank you sir..
2009-12-29T10:37:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	slinkeey	It is where any new features or non-security bugfixes will be coming in.
2009-12-29T10:38:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	slinkeey	If your Wifi does not work, it's not OS, it's the kernel. :O
2009-12-29T10:39:00.000Z	slinkeey	kinja-sheep	WIFI is working great now
2009-12-29T10:40:00.000Z	slinkeey	kinja-sheep	Well I don't want to bug you too much...  You seam to keep yourself pretty busy without my help....  You have a great day and a happy new year if i don't run into you before then.
2009-12-29T10:41:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	slinkeey	I'm glad to help people out. I have to RTFM on search engines to read and review stuffs. Solutions too.  Enjoy your freedom from wired connections. :)
2009-12-29T10:42:00.000Z	slinkeey	kinja-sheep	I am never the first to run into the problem so the answers is usually in the ubuntu forums..:)
