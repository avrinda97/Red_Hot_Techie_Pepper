2011-01-18T04:56:00.000Z	ether-boy		bluetooth module is  not available for my laptop. where should i report/request one?
2011-01-18T04:57:00.000Z	popey	ether-boy	does your laptop actually contain a bluetooth device?
2011-01-18T04:58:00.000Z	ether-boy	popey	yes, lsusb shows me the hardware being detected. "Broadcom Corp. BCM2046B1 USB 2.0 Hub (part of BCM2046 Bluetooth)"
2011-01-18T04:59:00.000Z	popey	ether-boy	then it should work, i know of no bluetooth chipsets for which there is no linux driver
2011-01-18T05:00:00.000Z	ether-boy	popey	help me find the driver. I have been looking for it since past few day but nothing positive. All I came to know about was few of the macbooks use the same hardware. Mine is a dell inspiron
2011-01-18T05:00:00.000Z	popey	ether-boy	ah, sorry, i may be wrong, looks like that device doesnt work
2011-01-18T05:00:00.000Z	ether-boy	popey	is there any ray of hope? may be in the next release of ubuntu?
