2011-05-28T04:02:00.000Z	nit-wit	ev_	8.04 hit end of life on the 12th of this month. There were some significant changes from 8.04 to 10.04 grub-legacy to grub2 and ext3 to ext4 among a few, you might consider a backup and a fresh install.
2011-05-28T04:03:00.000Z	ev_	nit-wit	thats what i want to do, my 10 live cd wont load(burnt 3) but 8 boots right up, just want to make sure the upgrade is to 10.04 or 10.10, not 11
2011-05-28T04:04:00.000Z	nit-wit	ev_	so the original disc was burned as an image at the slowest speed and you checked the md5sum, these are all variables with that 10.04 iso and cd burned.
2011-05-28T04:07:00.000Z	nit-wit	ev_	here is a link for checking the disc.  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM
2011-05-28T04:07:00.000Z	ev_	nit-wit	yes the cd was burned slow and md5 sum checks out
2011-05-28T04:09:00.000Z	nit-wit	ev_	the only time  have seen a propmt for a password s with a bad burn, if you have a xtrta usb thumb you might try that with a loader called unetbootin.
2011-05-28T04:10:00.000Z	nit-wit	ev_	sorry for the spelling.;(
2011-05-28T04:12:00.000Z	ev_	nit-wit	have tried a sandisk and kingston
2011-05-28T04:13:00.000Z	ev_	nit-wit	i have a working version 8.04 cd, im going to install that to the hd and do what BorgTK2001 said about the update manager only showing LTS versions
2011-05-28T04:14:00.000Z	nit-wit	ev_	sounds like good advice.;)
2011-05-28T04:15:00.000Z	ev_	nit-wit	didnt know update manager had that option till i came here
2011-05-28T04:16:00.000Z	nit-wit	ev_	the IIRC is a helpful place.
2011-05-28T04:16:00.000Z	ev_	nit-wit	indeed
