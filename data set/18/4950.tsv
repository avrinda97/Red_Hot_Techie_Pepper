2009-11-15T03:39:00.000Z	oCean_	eatloaf	check the /var/log/maillog to see if your mail got delivered (queued)
2009-11-15T03:41:00.000Z	eatloaf	jrib	ocean_: thanks. so mail.log shows this:Nov 14 14:40:16 monstr sendmail[23439]: nAEMdmbg023438: SYSERR(root): hash map "authinfo": unsafe map file /etc/mail/auth/client-info.db: Permission denied
2009-11-15T03:41:00.000Z	eatloaf		it looks like i have to remake the auth.info file rather than just copy it over. does that sound possible?
2009-11-15T03:42:00.000Z	oCean_	eatloaf	you said before you copied the /etc/mail dir from your previous install. Check the permissions...
2009-11-15T03:43:00.000Z	oCean_	eatloaf	yeah, if you have sendmail-cf installed, a "make clean -C /etc/mail" && "make -C /etc/mail" might help. (re-creates the *db files)
2009-11-15T03:43:00.000Z	eatloaf		why would mysql own authinfo.db? does this look right? -rwx------ 1 root    126    80 2009-04-29 14:43 client-info
2009-11-15T03:43:00.000Z	eatloaf		-rw-r----- 1 mysql   126 12288 2009-04-29 14:43 client-info.db
2009-11-15T03:44:00.000Z	eatloaf		ocean_: i did that. i use webmin to do all of that stuff because it's a GUI. I believe my dbs are up to date.
2009-11-15T03:44:00.000Z	oCean_	eatloaf	copying files from one installation to another is tricky, since the UID info on the first might not be the same on the 2nd install
2009-11-15T03:44:00.000Z	eatloaf	jrib	have any idea who should own authinfo.db ? root?
2009-11-15T03:45:00.000Z	oCean_		get your permissions & ownership right. Can't you check it with your previous install? The one you copied the files from?
2009-11-15T03:47:00.000Z	eatloaf		ocean_: it's just an fs mounted on the new system, so the permissions would show the same UID, no?
2009-11-15T03:47:00.000Z	eatloaf	jrib	i seem to not have an old /etc/passwd.
2009-11-15T03:48:00.000Z	oCean_	eatloaf	one moment.. let me find a box w/ sendmail
2009-11-15T03:50:00.000Z	eatloaf		ocean_, jrib: i suspect that remaking the authinfo files will fix my problem. can someone point me to a simple how-to?
2009-11-15T03:51:00.000Z	oCean_	eatloaf	no sure if this helps, but here is a freshly installed sendmail (to check your permissions/ownership etc): http://paste.ubuntu.com/318929/
2009-11-15T03:53:00.000Z	oCean_	eatloaf	the commands i send before might help in recreating your *db files: "make clean -C /etc/mail && make -C /etc/mail"
2009-11-15T03:53:00.000Z	oCean_	eatloaf	have to run.. g/luck
