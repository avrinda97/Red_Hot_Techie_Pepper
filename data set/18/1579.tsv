2011-01-21T05:08:00.000Z	sysop3		hi is it normal for sshd to be running evern after I do a ./etc/init.d/ssh stop?
2011-01-21T05:08:00.000Z	sysop3		it gets a new pid so it does something,
2011-01-21T05:08:00.000Z	sysop3		how can I kill all open connections?
2011-01-21T05:09:00.000Z	sysop3		/etc/init.d/sshd stop?
2011-01-21T05:09:00.000Z	sysop3		I do but it reopens with a new id
2011-01-21T05:10:00.000Z	sysop3		I had a hacker crack a password on a non privledged account and was running perl.
2011-01-21T05:10:00.000Z	sysop3		I deleted the user and home files but I cant get this sshd to stop running.
2011-01-21T05:11:00.000Z	sysop3		am I paranoid or is it just me. I stopped ssh at the firewall they arent getting in that way.
2011-01-21T05:11:00.000Z	sysop3		i do but a new pid gets created.
2011-01-21T05:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sysop3	use sudo to kill it
2011-01-21T05:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sysop3	remove it from rc.d and then reboot
2011-01-21T05:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sysop3	i recommend you install rkhunter and scan your system
2011-01-21T05:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sysop3	are you using lucid?
2011-01-21T05:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sysop3	10.10 is maverick, not lucid
2011-01-21T05:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sysop3	otherwise I'd generate the MD5 here and give it
2011-01-21T05:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sysop3	not sure, would make sense though
2011-01-21T05:39:00.000Z	sysop3	ActionParsnip	thanks anyway. I appreciate the attempt
2011-01-21T05:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	sysop3	if you can provide the full filename, maybe someone will play with you :)
