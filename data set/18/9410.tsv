2007-10-26T05:10:00.000Z	theTrav		hmm, this one is tricky.  I'm having trouble building my simple app that uses SDL_mixer.h.  It's giving me grief at the linker stage, where it is unable to resolve the functions that the header files refer to within SDL_mixer.  Anyone have a clue how to debug this in ubuntu?
2007-10-26T05:10:00.000Z	theTrav		so far I've checked /user/include and found that the header file is there and correct
2007-10-26T05:10:00.000Z	theTrav		I did only just install the dev package, do I need to restart before it will work with linking?
2007-10-26T05:11:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	theTrav	are you missing and -dev packages?
2007-10-26T05:11:00.000Z	theTrav	fyrestrtr	I'm pretty sure I've got the right -dev package
2007-10-26T05:12:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	theTrav	and libraries, and source -- depends on the package.
2007-10-26T05:13:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	theTrav	which file is it complaining about?
2007-10-26T05:15:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	theTrav	means you are missing a file that you should be compiling against.
2007-10-26T05:16:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	theTrav	what files are you including?
2007-10-26T05:16:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	theTrav	in your source.
2007-10-26T05:18:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	theTrav	what is your gcc command?
2007-10-26T05:19:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	theTrav	and your linker?
2007-10-26T05:20:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	theTrav	you need -lSDL_mixer in your linker
2007-10-26T05:20:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	theTrav	you are helfome. What IDE are you using?
2007-10-26T05:22:00.000Z	theTrav	fyrestrtr	I'm using eclipse with a c++ plugin
2007-10-26T05:23:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	theTrav	KDevelop makes life easier for such things.
2007-10-26T05:23:00.000Z	theTrav	fyrestrtr	this eclipse plugin is pretty good most of the time.  This is the only one it's stuffed up so far
2007-10-26T05:24:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	theTrav	I'll leave you to it then :)
