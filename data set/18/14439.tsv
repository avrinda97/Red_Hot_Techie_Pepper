2005-07-30T14:23:00.000Z	yaaar		anybody good with grub in here?
2005-07-30T14:24:00.000Z	enno_	yaaar	quite good
2005-07-30T14:24:00.000Z	yaaar	enno_	well, that's what i thought too until just now ;-)
2005-07-30T14:24:00.000Z	enno_	yaaar	whats the problem?
2005-07-30T14:25:00.000Z	yaaar	enno_	my friend had ubuntu on /dev/hdb with win2k on /dev/hda. grub was installed on hda. then he pulled the windows drive and put the ubuntu disk on prim master. so it wouldn't boot, naturally. (more coming)
2005-07-30T14:26:00.000Z	yaaar	enno_	so i popped in a gentoo livecd (it was handy), mounted the ubuntu partition, edited menu.lst, changed all the hd1's to hd0's and /dev/hdb's to /dev/hda's, ran grub, did 'root (hd0,0)' 'setup (hd0)' and 'quit' and rebooted......
2005-07-30T14:27:00.000Z	yaaar	enno_	but when i boot it drops me at a 'grub>' prompt. i can boot by typing 'configfile /boot/grub/menu.lst' ...but otherwise it won't give me my menu
2005-07-30T14:28:00.000Z	enno_		majikstreet:no
2005-07-30T14:29:00.000Z	enno_	yaaar	grub can read filesystems at boot time. check if menu.lst exists on the choosen partition?
2005-07-30T14:30:00.000Z	yaaar	enno_	obviously it does exist, else it wouldn't boot with 'configfile /boot/grub/menu.lst' no?
2005-07-30T14:31:00.000Z	enno_	yaaar	if you did setup and root at prompt it boots?
2005-07-30T14:32:00.000Z	yaaar	enno_	er....i did root and setup from within 'grub' from the booted livecd. then after rebooting it drops me at the grub prompt and i typed configfile /boot/grub/menu.lst to boot
2005-07-30T14:33:00.000Z	yaaar	enno_	hmm...that's odd. did those commands again from the prompt it gave at boot, then did reboot, now it seems to work
2005-07-30T14:33:00.000Z	yaaar	enno_	wonder why that is
2005-07-30T14:33:00.000Z	enno_	yaaar	try setup / root again at the prompt
2005-07-30T14:34:00.000Z	yaaar		(see above)
2005-07-30T14:34:00.000Z	yaaar		thanks
2005-07-30T14:34:00.000Z	enno_	yaaar	i had same problem some time ago. if it works everything is okay :)
