2006-01-27T15:14:00.000Z	_jason	L_Nova	if you follow what I said, it should work
2006-01-27T15:15:00.000Z	_jason	L_Nova	yes (you don't have to, it was just to condense the command, but it will work like that)
2006-01-27T15:17:00.000Z	_jason	L_Nova	which command was not found?
2006-01-27T15:18:00.000Z	_jason	L_Nova	no, the error should tell you which one.  Check for typos
2006-01-27T15:24:00.000Z	L_Nova	_jason	the last bit, "make the first line look like http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/7491 (where your hostname is in /mnt/ubuntuhd/etc/hostname).  Copy this and save it somewhere :)"
2006-01-27T15:24:00.000Z	_jason	L_Nova	yes?
2006-01-27T15:25:00.000Z	L_Nova	_jason	 so i just put paul instead of my_hostname?
2006-01-27T15:26:00.000Z	_jason	L_Nova	is that what /mnt/ubuntuhd/etc/hostname says?
2006-01-27T15:28:00.000Z	L_Nova	_jason	when i put "/mnt/ubuntuhd/etc/hostname" i get "permission denied"
2006-01-27T15:28:00.000Z	_jason	L_Nova	gedit /mnt/ubuntuhd/etc/hostname
2006-01-27T15:30:00.000Z	L_Nova	_jason	it says my hostname is ubuntu
2006-01-27T15:31:00.000Z	_jason	L_Nova	ok, that's what you put
2006-01-27T15:32:00.000Z	_jason	L_Nova	yep
2006-01-27T15:33:00.000Z	_jason	L_Nova	hopefully, go try it
