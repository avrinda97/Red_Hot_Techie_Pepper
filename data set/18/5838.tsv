2008-08-14T02:20:00.000Z	greywhind_		I have a new laptop, with an Intel 5300AGN wireless card, which doesn't seem to be detected by the Ubuntu Live CD. Does anyone know how I might go about getting the 5300AGN working?
2008-08-14T02:21:00.000Z	infinitycircuit	greywhind_	that's a very very new card i don't know any support for it right now, or anything that uses it other than a thinkpad x200
2008-08-14T02:21:00.000Z	greywhind_	infinitycircuit	any idea when there might be support?
2008-08-14T02:21:00.000Z	greywhind_		or whether it might work with Ndiswrapper?
2008-08-14T02:22:00.000Z	infinitycircuit	greywhind_	first thing to try would be intrepid/search lkml mailing lists
2008-08-14T02:22:00.000Z	infinitycircuit		ndiswrapper is probably the only chance
2008-08-14T02:22:00.000Z	greywhind_	infinitycircuit	could you point me to those two places i should search?
2008-08-14T02:25:00.000Z	infinitycircuit	greywhind_	searches for this card point back to the 4965. you should try those drivers
2008-08-14T02:25:00.000Z	greywhind_	infinitycircuit	also, would this entry on the ndiswrapper support list be what i'm looking for: Card: Intel PRO/Wireless 5000 LAN CardBus Adapter 802.11g
2008-08-14T02:25:00.000Z	infinitycircuit	greywhind_	possible
2008-08-14T02:26:00.000Z	greywhind_	infinitycircuit	well, i'm still using the live CD at this point, but i tried sudo modprobe iwl4965 and it didn't give me any network devices
2008-08-14T02:26:00.000Z	infinitycircuit	greywhind_	you should try ndiswrapper
2008-08-14T02:26:00.000Z	greywhind_	infinitycircuit	i didn't install any firmware though - is that necessary?
2008-08-14T02:27:00.000Z	greywhind_	infinitycircuit	i'm looking at this page: http://wiki.debian.org/iwlwifi
2008-08-14T02:27:00.000Z	infinitycircuit	greywhind_	yes
2008-08-14T02:27:00.000Z	greywhind_	infinitycircuit	so i should hook up to a wired connection, install firmware-iwlwifi, then try sudo modprobe iwl4965?
2008-08-14T02:28:00.000Z	infinitycircuit	greywhind_	you can try that. or download ndiswrapper and try using the windows fw
2008-08-14T02:28:00.000Z	greywhind_	infinitycircuit	ok, thanks
