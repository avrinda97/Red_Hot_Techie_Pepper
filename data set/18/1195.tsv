2011-05-07T05:00:00.000Z	Limada		no web developer who can help me to launch my PHP files in Firefox? =(. I moved my files to /var/www but can't see them. Hope somebody  can help-
2011-05-07T05:01:00.000Z	LjL	Limada	erm, do you have a web server running?
2011-05-07T05:01:00.000Z	Limada	LjL	yes, Apache.
2011-05-07T05:01:00.000Z	LjL	Limada	are the php files set executable?
2011-05-07T05:01:00.000Z	Limada	LjL	well...errr.... how can I test it?
2011-05-07T05:02:00.000Z	LjL	Limada	ls -l /var/www/file.php
2011-05-07T05:02:00.000Z	LjL	Limada	otherwise, see here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/ApacheMySQLPHP#Troubleshooting PHP 5
2011-05-07T05:02:00.000Z	Limada	LjL	yes, I can read them in the terminal but Firefox doesn' t want to cooperate to see them local.
2011-05-07T05:03:00.000Z	Limada	LjL	thanks. I'll take a look there.
2011-05-07T05:03:00.000Z	LjL	Limada	i'm not asking you whether you can see them in the terminal, i want the output of ls -l so i can see whether they're executable
2011-05-07T05:03:00.000Z	Limada	LjL	ok. Hold on :)
2011-05-07T05:04:00.000Z	Limada	LjL	ls: cannot access /var/www/file.php: No such file or directory
2011-05-07T05:05:00.000Z	LjL	Limada	substitute file.php with the actual file you have :P
2011-05-07T05:07:00.000Z	LjL	Limada	ok, it's not executable. do "sudo chmod a+x /var/www/index.php"
2011-05-07T05:08:00.000Z	LjL	Limada	no, you need to do it to the files. you could do it recursively though. chmod -r etc
2011-05-07T05:10:00.000Z	Limada	LjL	KNUBIGG, thanks! hope it works.
2011-05-07T05:10:00.000Z	LjL	Limada	if it doesn't, try following that troubleshooting section. i'm flying to bed now, see you later
2011-05-07T05:11:00.000Z	Limada	LjL	thanks, have a good rest.
