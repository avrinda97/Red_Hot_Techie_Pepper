2009-10-21T09:03:00.000Z	mandrig	xlelouchxx	you were flooding, meaning posting too much
2009-10-21T09:03:00.000Z	mandrig	xlelouchxx	and help will come, but you need to describe your problem better...
2009-10-21T09:04:00.000Z	mandrig	xlelouchxx	is it that your keyboard isn't working? (because obviously it is, you're typing on it right now.)
2009-10-21T09:05:00.000Z	mandrig	xlelouchxx	so, the arrow keys aren't working?
2009-10-21T09:05:00.000Z	mandrig	xlelouchxx	does it work on the rest of the bios screens?
2009-10-21T09:06:00.000Z	mandrig	xlelouchxx	then the problem is likely with GRUB
2009-10-21T09:08:00.000Z	mandrig	xlelouchxx	so, do you want to get rid of windows all-together?
2009-10-21T09:11:00.000Z	mandrig	xlelouchxx	when it asks you which OS to load, it should say something like "GRUB v. 2.xxx"
