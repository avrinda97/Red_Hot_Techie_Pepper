2007-03-29T12:03:00.000Z	vanberge		is anybody willing to help me get my external HD writable?  Im starting to get desperate, i just bought it today!
2007-03-29T12:04:00.000Z	yell0w	vanberge	is it fat32 ?
2007-03-29T12:04:00.000Z	vanberge	yell0w	pirea it is pre-formatted ntfs unfortunately  :-(
2007-03-29T12:05:00.000Z	vanberge	yell0w	i already went through that...
2007-03-29T12:05:00.000Z	yell0w	vanberge	did you try ntfs-3g ?
2007-03-29T12:05:00.000Z	vanberge	yell0w	yes i just did that... plus got the ntfs-config tool
2007-03-29T12:06:00.000Z	yell0w	vanberge	as pirea said, why not format it as fat32 or ext3 ?
2007-03-29T12:06:00.000Z	yell0w	vanberge	writing to ntfs is at a very early stage right now
2007-03-29T12:06:00.000Z	vanberge	yell0w	i wouldnt mind... but i can't get it to do anything
2007-03-29T12:07:00.000Z	vanberge	yell0w	 even if open iwht partitioner, cannot do anything with it
2007-03-29T12:07:00.000Z	yell0w	vanberge	even with gparted ?
2007-03-29T12:07:00.000Z	yell0w	vanberge	start gparted, unmount the drive, then reformat it
2007-03-29T12:07:00.000Z	vanberge	yell0w	i can't even delete the partition
2007-03-29T12:08:00.000Z	yell0w	vanberge	what does gparted tell you ?
2007-03-29T12:11:00.000Z	vanberge	yell0w	pirea tyvm... i think i'm good now!
