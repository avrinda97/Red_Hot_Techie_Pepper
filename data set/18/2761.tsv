2010-03-26T02:06:00.000Z	faron		hello again everybody-I am at http://www.getgnash.org/packages/releases/debian/lenny/ & I am confused as to which one of these I should be selecting...amd64.deb,i386.deb ormipsel.deb ??
2010-03-26T02:06:00.000Z	jrib	faron	gnash is in ubuntu's repostiories
2010-03-26T02:07:00.000Z	jrib	faron	then you should be using the *ubuntu* repositories, not debian
2010-03-26T02:07:00.000Z	jrib	faron	http://getgnash.org/packages/ (scroll to "for ubuntu")
2010-03-26T02:11:00.000Z	jrib	faron	they have packages at http://getgnash.org/packages/releases/ubuntu/hardy/ but really if you want recent software use a recent release
2010-03-26T03:05:00.000Z	jrib	faron	what does « uname -m » return?
2010-03-26T03:06:00.000Z	jrib	faron	then you want the _i386.deb
2010-03-26T03:06:00.000Z	jrib	faron	(for ubuntu of course)
2010-03-26T03:07:00.000Z	jrib	faron	yep :)
2010-03-26T03:10:00.000Z	jrib	faron	what dependency?
2010-03-26T03:11:00.000Z	jrib	faron	it should
2010-03-26T03:12:00.000Z	jrib	faron	should be next to "dependencies not satisfiable"
2010-03-26T03:15:00.000Z	faron	jrib	I wonder if I maybe reinstalled the older version & then tried to install the new on top ?
2010-03-26T03:15:00.000Z	jrib	faron	I don't know what your error is
2010-03-26T03:17:00.000Z	jrib	faron	are you only installing one .deb, because I seem to recall several .debs on gnash's site?  Why aren't you just using the repository again?
2010-03-26T03:19:00.000Z	jrib	faron	the first thing I said to you is important too
2010-03-26T03:21:00.000Z	jrib	faron	you can type the beginning of my nick and hit tab to save some time typing: jr<TAB>
2010-03-26T05:13:00.000Z	faron	jrib	taught me a trick earlier with his name but it doesn't seem to work with izmanromli's...........iz[tab] ?
