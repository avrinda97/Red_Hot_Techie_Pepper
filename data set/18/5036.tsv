2009-09-30T19:45:00.000Z	duffydack	shane2peru	what lib are you talking about.
2009-09-30T19:45:00.000Z	shane2peru	duffydack	watermark.so
2009-09-30T19:46:00.000Z	shane2peru	duffydack	<- that is hard to type even the first two letters correctly I want to type da(tab). :)
2009-09-30T19:46:00.000Z	shane2peru	duffydack	it is for vhook with ffmpeg to watermark videos
2009-09-30T19:48:00.000Z	duffydack	shane2peru	hmm, generally, you have to get the source package and drop into the libavcodec folder of the ffmpeg source, to be able to --enable-whatever
2009-09-30T19:49:00.000Z	shane2peru	duffydack	ok, I built from source, let me check that out
2009-09-30T19:49:00.000Z	duffydack	shane2peru	been a while since i compiled ffmpeg, but just do ./configure to list all the options available...if a watermark one is not there, you`d need to add the dev files for it.
2009-09-30T19:50:00.000Z	duffydack	shane2peru	thats how I integrated libamr (3gp)
2009-09-30T19:52:00.000Z	shane2peru	duffydack	ok, thanks for the pointers!  I did a locate watermark.so and it is nowhere to be found on my system, so I doubt I have it even in those folders.
2009-09-30T19:53:00.000Z	duffydack	shane2peru	actually, configure and install the watermark from source.. then you can --enable
2009-09-30T19:53:00.000Z	shane2peru	duffydack	looks like that is my only option atm, thanks.
2009-09-30T19:54:00.000Z	shane2peru	duffydack	I followed FakeOutdoorsmans guide on the forums, I'll get you the link if you like
2009-09-30T19:55:00.000Z	shane2peru	duffydack	here is the guide I used, pretty decent. http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=786095
2009-09-30T19:56:00.000Z	duffydack	shane2peru	if you mean fakeoutdoorsman`s , yeah.....    have a look http://lists.mplayerhq.hu/pipermail/ffmpeg-user/2009-March/019397.html
2009-09-30T19:57:00.000Z	duffydack	shane2peru	something about vhook.... never touched it myself...
2009-09-30T19:58:00.000Z	shane2peru	duffydack	you got the google fu today!  hmm, seems to be going out!  vhook is used to watermark you video.
2009-09-30T19:58:00.000Z	shane2peru	duffydack	odd, for once seems I need an older version, not the newer. lol :)
2010-08-14T19:36:00.000Z	duffydack	shane2peru	remove all the icons and add them to the top bar as well
