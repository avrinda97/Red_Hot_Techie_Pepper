2006-08-09T13:36:00.000Z	Nimwei		Which file do I edit for the startup programs?
2006-08-09T13:38:00.000Z	Nimwei		Probably the boot file..because I don't want to have to login for my webserver and everything else to run.
2006-08-09T13:38:00.000Z	phenex	Nimwei	you may want to check out the package sysv-rc-conf
2006-08-09T13:38:00.000Z	phenex	Nimwei	i think that is what you are looking for
2006-08-09T13:38:00.000Z	Nimwei	phenex	- I'm downloading it now.
2006-08-09T13:39:00.000Z	phenex	Nimwei	ok, then ask about runlevels if you don't get it
2006-08-09T13:39:00.000Z	Nimwei	phenex	- does it have a GUI or is it command based?
2006-08-09T13:40:00.000Z	phenex	Nimwei	it is ncurses based, so gui on the command line :)
2006-08-09T13:40:00.000Z	phenex	Nimwei	start from command line ... it's good for accessing over ssh etc too
2006-08-09T13:41:00.000Z	phenex	Nimwei	course, the hard part is knowing what services you want to start at boot up
2006-08-09T13:41:00.000Z	phenex	Nimwei	first, do you know what services you want to disable?
2006-08-09T13:41:00.000Z	phenex	Nimwei	i have a good-ish link here somewhere ...
2006-08-09T13:51:00.000Z	Nimwei	phenex	- Sorry, I had to run outside for a few moments.
2006-08-09T13:52:00.000Z	phenex	Nimwei	cool
2006-08-09T13:53:00.000Z	phenex	Nimwei	well, basically stuff you don't want to load , take all the X's away .. but know what you are disabling
2006-08-09T13:57:00.000Z	phenex	Nimwei	yeah, you need a startup script for it in /etc/init.d
2006-08-09T13:58:00.000Z	phenex	Nimwei	one probably came with it
2006-08-09T13:58:00.000Z	phenex	Nimwei	you probably only have to put it in /etc/init.d , if it isn't already there
