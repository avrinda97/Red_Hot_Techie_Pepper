2006-11-26T10:19:00.000Z	mojojojo_		hi there my sound in Ubuntu stopped working :( :( :(
2006-11-26T10:20:00.000Z	dabaR	mojojojo_	did you look at System>Prefs>Sound to see whether anything is muted?
2006-11-26T10:21:00.000Z	mojojojo_	dabaR	are you sure its System>Prefs>Sound? there's no settings for making anything muted
2006-11-26T10:23:00.000Z	dabaR	mojojojo_	ya, I was wrong. double click the little sound icon in the top right.
2006-11-26T10:24:00.000Z	mojojojo_	dabaR	anyting is unmuted
2006-11-26T10:24:00.000Z	mojojojo_	dabaR	everything is unmuted
2006-11-26T10:25:00.000Z	dabaR	mojojojo_	run sudo invoke-rc.d alsa-utils restart in a terminal, show me output on a pastebin if it is more than one line.
2006-11-26T10:27:00.000Z	mojojojo_	dabaR	 * Shutting down ALSA...                                                 [ ok ] 
2006-11-26T10:27:00.000Z	dabaR	mojojojo_	and open xmms now again, from a terminal, try playing a song.
2006-11-26T10:28:00.000Z	mojojojo_	dabaR	no difference - ** WARNING **: alsa_setup(): Failed to open pcm device (default): Nie ma takiego pliku ani katalogu
2006-11-26T10:28:00.000Z	mojojojo_	dabaR	 it's sth to do with gnome itself because Ubuntu plays welcoming tune nicely before loading gnome
2006-11-26T10:29:00.000Z	dabaR	mojojojo_	open the xmms properties, and change the sound output to something else,see what you have now. Are you using edgy?
2006-11-26T10:31:00.000Z	mojojojo_	dabaR	it worked after I changed from default to other. But it's xmms, firefox will still refuse to play anything for example
2006-11-26T10:31:00.000Z	dabaR	mojojojo_	like flash sound?
2006-11-26T10:32:00.000Z	dabaR	mojojojo_	well, at least you can listen to music while we fix it...
2006-11-26T10:32:00.000Z	mojojojo_	dabaR	like flash sound :)
2006-11-26T10:32:00.000Z	mojojojo_	dabaR	 yeah :D :D
2006-11-26T10:32:00.000Z	dabaR	mojojojo_	you should read the flash section of https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats , I saw some fixes there, but never had to apply any.
