2005-09-19T05:29:00.000Z	pluggo		Hopefully I have a password solution, phoenixp3k
2005-09-19T05:29:00.000Z	phoenixp3k	pluggo	had the same prob last time I installed Ubunty
2005-09-19T05:29:00.000Z	phoenixp3k	pluggo	both root and my user password do not let me access the updater
2005-09-19T05:33:00.000Z	pluggo	phoenixp3k	Are you logged into that machine now?
2005-09-19T05:33:00.000Z	phoenixp3k	pluggo	yup I'm using the same password I used to log in
2005-09-19T05:34:00.000Z	pluggo	phoenixp3k	Did you ever set a root password?
2005-09-19T05:34:00.000Z	phoenixp3k	pluggo	yes I did
2005-09-19T05:35:00.000Z	phoenixp3k	pluggo	I tryed it as well
2005-09-19T05:37:00.000Z	pluggo	phoenixp3k	Try "su" then "nano /etc/sudoers"
2005-09-19T05:39:00.000Z	phoenixp3k	pluggo	messed up the command a bit
2005-09-19T05:41:00.000Z	phoenixp3k	pluggo	I put my password or the admin/root psswd?
2005-09-19T05:42:00.000Z	phoenixp3k	pluggo	It says usermod : admin group unknown
2005-09-19T05:49:00.000Z	pluggo	phoenixp3k	If you just type "sudo" in a shell does it let you in with your password?
2005-09-19T05:50:00.000Z	phoenixp3k	pluggo	If I just time sudo it tells me the options of sudo
2005-09-19T05:51:00.000Z	pluggo	phoenixp3k	sorry, I meant "sudo sh"
2005-09-19T05:52:00.000Z	phoenixp3k	pluggo	how can I add myself in the sudoers file
2005-09-19T05:56:00.000Z	pluggo	phoenixp3k	su -c "nano /etc/sudoers"
2005-09-19T05:57:00.000Z	phoenixp3k	pluggo	rob_p . It's in the terminal window, I add myself there?
