2008-03-25T21:02:00.000Z	gamma-k		I'm totally green here. Can anyone help me with a user rights problem. At least I think thats what it is.
2008-03-25T21:03:00.000Z	captainm	gamma-k	we can always try
2008-03-25T21:04:00.000Z	gamma-k	captainm	thanks! I installed Ubuntu next to Vista and i need to hide the Windows volumes from other users. I don't know how.
2008-03-25T21:06:00.000Z	captainm	gamma-k	press alt-f2 and type gksudo nautilus then you can just right-click on the volume and set the permissions under properties.
2008-03-25T21:07:00.000Z	gamma-k	captainm	Excellent! I'll try that. Does it affect Windows rights in any way?
2008-03-25T21:07:00.000Z	captainm	gamma-k	It won't affect the windows install (if that's what you mean)
2008-03-25T21:08:00.000Z	gamma-k	captainm	That's exactly what I mean :)
2008-03-25T21:11:00.000Z	gamma-k	captainm	I'm a little confused, there are two volumes on the desktop: System and WinRE. These do not show in Nautilus. Am I doing something wrong?
2008-03-25T21:13:00.000Z	captainm	gamma-k	you can find them in the /media/ folder. Be careful though. The command gksudo nautilus opens a nautilus window with root privileges. It's easy to mess something up as root ;)
2008-03-25T21:27:00.000Z	gamma-k	captainm	it did not seem to solve my problem. I only added one user after myself. We both have windows system folders on desktop. The other user does not have root priviledges. Still he is able to delete them.
2008-03-25T21:32:00.000Z	captainm	gamma-k	set the owner to "nobody", all the other options to "none" an click on aply settings to content of the folder (or something like that). You'll still be able to see the drive, just not access it.
2008-03-25T21:39:00.000Z	captainm	gamma-k	It just occurred to me that we've been doing this the hard way :P you can also edit /etc/fstab so linux doesn't mount the drives automaticly
2008-03-25T21:41:00.000Z	captainm	gamma-k	in a terminal type gksu gedit /etc/fstab and find the windows partitions. Change the options "auto" to "noauto" and "user" to "nouser"
2008-03-25T21:45:00.000Z	gamma-k	captainm	it doesn't seem to let me change anything. It immediately restores the owner back to 'root'. As well are the folder priviledges restored before i can apply them.
2008-03-25T21:46:00.000Z	captainm	gamma-k	We've been trying to do this the hard way. My bad! It's better to tell Linux not to mount the drives on startup and make sure users can't mount the drives. In a terminal type gksu gedit /etc/fstab and find the windows partitions. Change the options "auto" to "noauto" and "user" to "nouser"
2008-03-25T21:49:00.000Z	gamma-k	captainm	Ok! I'll just annoy you a little more: Is it possible to leave the drives visible and accessible to me only, not the other users? If it is not fairly easy, please don't bother, I'm just a beginner :)
2008-03-25T21:51:00.000Z	captainm	gamma-k	No problem! You could always mount them when you need them but that's a bit of a hassle. So we're back at setting the permisions again :P. Give me a sec and I'll try to find an easy way
