2009-05-15T09:41:00.000Z	tanath		anyone know how to recover a damaged ext4 filesystem?
2009-05-15T09:42:00.000Z	tanath		i don't want to lose my data >.<
2009-05-15T09:42:00.000Z	tanath		fsck seems to think it's ext3/2
2009-05-15T09:43:00.000Z	losher	tanath	there's not a lot of experience with ext4 out there as it's so new. Can you read the filesystem & copy files off it?
2009-05-15T09:44:00.000Z	tanath	losher	no, i can't. says unknown filesystem >.<
2009-05-15T09:44:00.000Z	tanath	losher	all i did was reboot
2009-05-15T09:46:00.000Z	losher	tanath	can you run /sbin/fsck.ext4 directly ?
2009-05-15T09:46:00.000Z	losher	tanath	I personally don't consider ext4 ready for prime time.
2009-05-15T09:47:00.000Z	tanath	losher	why's that?
2009-05-15T09:47:00.000Z	tanath	losher	i thought it was basically an improvement on ext3
2009-05-15T09:48:00.000Z	losher	tanath	it's new. new means less stable. unstable is bad when it comes to filesystems....
2009-05-15T09:49:00.000Z	losher	tanath	but it's running at least? You're the 2nd person I've seen here saying their ext4 spontaneously corrupted itself.
2009-05-15T09:50:00.000Z	tanath	losher	well, i rebooted while downloading to the drive, but it should have shut down, or prompted me to close the app first if it didn't shut down in time...
2009-05-15T10:04:00.000Z	losher	tanath	still playing filesystem russian-roulette?
2009-05-15T10:04:00.000Z	tanath	losher	still holding down 'y' to fix errors :P
2009-05-15T10:05:00.000Z	losher	tanath	very scary. Might not be much left...
2009-05-15T10:05:00.000Z	tanath	losher	somehow it got supremely fubared
2009-05-15T10:06:00.000Z	losher	tanath	bugs in the ext4 code I expect. They really didn't make the state of ext4 clear enough in the 9.04 release notes
