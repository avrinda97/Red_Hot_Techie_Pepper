2006-10-18T07:12:00.000Z	_ian_		i did use sudo....
2006-10-18T07:12:00.000Z	mnepton		well, that's not what you typed in here ;)
2006-10-18T07:12:00.000Z	mnepton	_ian_	did you install build-essentials on that machine?
2006-10-18T07:13:00.000Z	mnepton		*build-essential
2006-10-18T07:13:00.000Z	_ian_		sorry but what are build essentials?
2006-10-18T07:13:00.000Z	mnepton		gcc, make, etc etc
2006-10-18T07:14:00.000Z	_ian_		cpp and gcc was there already because i was trying to find what the error messagge was. i didnt even install those things they were there already
2006-10-18T07:15:00.000Z	_ian_		is there a easier way to simply upgrade i mean all i do with this comp is to surf the net and listen to radios..... kinda hard for new users
2006-10-18T07:15:00.000Z	mnepton	_ian_	get a CD.
2006-10-18T07:16:00.000Z	mnepton	_ian_	is this a Breezy -> Dapper upgrade?
2006-10-18T07:16:00.000Z	_ian_		but all my files and bookmarks and all the things i did will disappear right? 5.10 to 6.06
2006-10-18T07:16:00.000Z	mnepton	_ian_	do not format the drive. your adata will be intact
