2009-05-26T14:02:00.000Z	mufasis		ty aw
2009-05-26T14:02:00.000Z	mufasis		to isntall a debian package in ubuntu you do sudo dpkg -i <name of pkg> right?
2009-05-26T14:04:00.000Z	mufasis		no i was just curious what that ment im not going to do it
2009-05-26T14:04:00.000Z	mufasis		if i have a package that ends in .deb i install using dpkg -i name.deb right?
2009-05-26T14:06:00.000Z	mufasis		i ment how do i install debian package from cli
2009-05-26T14:07:00.000Z	Chousuke	mufasis	dpkg -i foo.deb
2009-05-26T14:07:00.000Z	Chousuke	mufasis	but usually you should use aptitude instead of installing debs manually
2009-05-26T14:09:00.000Z	Chousuke	mufasis	no.
2009-05-26T14:11:00.000Z	Chousuke	mufasis	yeah. providing you have all the dependencies installed
2009-05-26T14:12:00.000Z	Chousuke	mufasis	on a server install, I don't think it automounts
2009-05-26T14:14:00.000Z	Chousuke	mufasis	using the "mount" utility
2009-05-26T14:16:00.000Z	Chousuke	mufasis	when you plug in the key, run "dmesg"; you should see a message about the usb key somewhere
2009-05-26T14:16:00.000Z	Chousuke	mufasis	(somewhere near the end that is)
2009-05-26T14:16:00.000Z	Chousuke	mufasis	in that message, there should be "sda" or "sdb" or something like that; it tells you what name the device has been given.
2009-05-26T14:17:00.000Z	Chousuke	mufasis	then you will need to mount some partition from that device. they're numbered, and usually you want the first one, so it's sda1 or sdb1 or something
2009-05-26T14:18:00.000Z	Chousuke	mufasis	then: sudo mount /dev/sda1 -t vfat /directory/to/mount/to
2009-05-26T14:19:00.000Z	Chousuke	mufasis	-t vfat just specifies the filesystem, it can be sometimes autodetected, so your command works too
2009-05-26T14:19:00.000Z	Chousuke	mufasis	yes
