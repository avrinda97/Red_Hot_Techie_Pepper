2010-01-09T18:03:00.000Z	mmvx	shrikant	what is you want to do?
2010-01-09T18:05:00.000Z	mmvx	shrikant	are you using network manager?
2010-01-09T18:05:00.000Z	mmvx	shrikant	are these cards wireless?
2010-01-09T18:06:00.000Z	mmvx	shrikant	are they static or dhcp?
2010-01-09T18:07:00.000Z	mmvx	shrikant	probably the best method is to list the cards in /etc/network/interfaces
2010-01-09T18:09:00.000Z	mmvx	shrikant	if the machine is fairly static and the addresses will not change then this method is very reliable and maintenance free but does involve editing a couple of config files
2010-01-09T18:10:00.000Z	shrikant	mmvx	ok i will make change pls tell me what are change is require
2010-01-09T18:11:00.000Z	mmvx	shrikant	one of the cards will be connected to a gateway/router?
2010-01-09T18:12:00.000Z	mmvx	shrikant	run sudo ifconfig -a, you should see both cards listed as eth{number}, you need to work out which one is connnected to your gateway
2010-01-09T18:13:00.000Z	mmvx	shrikant	or which one you WANT to be connected to your gateway
2010-01-09T18:13:00.000Z	shrikant	mmvx	ok findout now
2010-01-09T18:14:00.000Z	mmvx	shrikant	ok and the other is eth0?
2010-01-09T18:14:00.000Z	mmvx	shrikant	do you have a preference for dns servers?
2010-01-09T18:15:00.000Z	mmvx	shrikant	ok cool, you need to put your preferred nameservers in /etc/resolv.conf in the format: nameserver x.x.x.x where x.x.x.x is the nameserver IP address
2010-01-09T18:19:00.000Z	mmvx	shrikant	when you've done that you need to edit the /etc/network/interfaces file with root priveleges, you can use your choice of text editor!
2010-01-09T18:22:00.000Z	shrikant	mmvx	can i send u pm
2010-01-09T18:22:00.000Z	mmvx	shrikant	yes no problem
