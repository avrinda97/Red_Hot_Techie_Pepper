2006-03-10T17:58:00.000Z	_-H22		i have a little question
2006-03-10T17:58:00.000Z	_-H22		how could i use the .bin files under linux?
2006-03-10T17:59:00.000Z	Spliffster	_-H22	usually just run them, ie. in a term, type sh <filename>.bin
2006-03-10T17:59:00.000Z	Spliffster	_-H22	if the file is really made for linux 2.6
2006-03-10T06:00:00.000Z	Spliffster	_-H22	try (in a term): $ file <filename>.bin
2006-03-10T06:00:00.000Z	Spliffster	_-H22	this will give you the type of the file
2006-03-10T06:01:00.000Z	Spliffster	_-H22	this usually means that it is a) a data file (how smart, aint i?) or b) it's unknown ...in either way it doesn't seem to be a linux executable
2006-03-10T06:06:00.000Z	Spliffster	_-H22	yes you can mount it .... 1 sec
2006-03-10T06:08:00.000Z	Spliffster	_-H22	mount -o loop -t iso9660 filename.iso /mnt/iso
2006-03-10T06:08:00.000Z	Spliffster	_-H22	you have to do it as root: $ sudo mount -o loop -t iso9660 filename.iso /mnt/iso
2006-03-10T06:11:00.000Z	Spliffster	_-H22	hav you used -o loop -t iso9660 ?
2006-03-10T06:11:00.000Z	Spliffster	_-H22	$ sudo mount -o loop -t iso9660 filename.iso /mnt/iso
2006-03-10T06:12:00.000Z	Spliffster	_-H22	so s/iso/bin/
2006-03-10T06:12:00.000Z	Spliffster	_-H22	mount -o loop -t iso9660 <your file name> <your mount point>
2006-03-10T06:14:00.000Z	Spliffster	_-H22	did you use sudo '
2006-03-10T06:15:00.000Z	Spliffster	_-H22	yes, the <mount point< directory must be available ad readable
2006-03-10T06:15:00.000Z	Spliffster	_-H22	it can be anywhere you wish
