2005-09-06T09:11:00.000Z	LaserLine		Is it normal for Gnome Battery Charge Monitor to take a l-o-n-g time to identify AC Power and Battery power?
2005-09-06T09:11:00.000Z	paulproteus	LaserLine	Depends on the underlying hardware.
2005-09-06T09:11:00.000Z	LaserLine	paulproteus	what do you mean ?
2005-09-06T09:11:00.000Z	paulproteus	LaserLine	My iBook takes a two or three seconds.
2005-09-06T09:11:00.000Z	paulproteus	LaserLine	What laptop?
2005-09-06T09:12:00.000Z	LaserLine	paulproteus	Fujitsu Siemens S-4546 (P3-600, 256MB RAM, 10GB Hardrive, Intel440MX Chipset)
2005-09-06T09:12:00.000Z	LaserLine	paulproteus	more then 3 minutes, or me refreshing the gnome panel...
2005-09-06T09:13:00.000Z	LaserLine	paulproteus	yesterday all was good but my HD crashed terrible so i had to wipe everything etc... the only change i did was disable PNP BIOS, maybe I should enable it ?
2005-09-06T09:13:00.000Z	paulproteus	LaserLine	Yes.
2005-09-06T09:14:00.000Z	LaserLine	paulproteus	I get confused. what does that setting say anyway, Linux isn't a PNP OS...
2005-09-06T09:14:00.000Z	paulproteus	LaserLine	Linux is *too* a Plug-and-Play OS. :)
2005-09-06T09:14:00.000Z	LaserLine	paulproteus	I like linux...it's nice :D
2005-09-06T09:14:00.000Z	paulproteus	LaserLine	Linux back in, like, 1997 wasn't.  But things have changed since then.
2005-09-06T09:15:00.000Z	paulproteus	LaserLine	PnP is about the way some low-level stuff works, not about the user experience. :)
2005-09-06T09:15:00.000Z	LaserLine	paulproteus	yeah, I read a document about it the other day...
2005-09-06T09:25:00.000Z	LaserLine	paulproteus	- you the man !!! it works now !
2005-09-06T09:25:00.000Z	LaserLine	paulproteus	and the battery time/precentage is accurate too...
2005-09-06T09:26:00.000Z	paulproteus	LaserLine	Glad to hear it. :)
