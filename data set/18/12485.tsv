2006-04-14T12:22:00.000Z	mechatronic		Hi all
2006-04-14T12:22:00.000Z	mechatronic		Can I ask a question?
2006-04-14T12:23:00.000Z	mechatronic		this is my problem: http://vnoss.pastebin.com/649899
2006-04-14T12:24:00.000Z	nickrud	mechatronic	where'd you get your mplayer?
2006-04-14T12:24:00.000Z	mechatronic	nickrud	i get from fc5
2006-04-14T12:25:00.000Z	nickrud	mechatronic	you cannot mix & match fc5 & ubuntu
2006-04-14T12:25:00.000Z	nickrud	mechatronic	you have probably blown up your system ;(
2006-04-14T12:26:00.000Z	mechatronic	nickrud	huh, i think alien can convert rpm -> deb
2006-04-14T12:26:00.000Z	nickrud	mechatronic	sure, but binary compatablility, filesystem layouts....
2006-04-14T12:27:00.000Z	nickrud	mechatronic	alien is not a panacea
2006-04-14T12:27:00.000Z	mechatronic	nickrud	should I compile from source
2006-04-14T12:27:00.000Z	nickrud	mechatronic	you get mplayer from ubuntu repos, glibc comes with ubuntu, etc.
2006-04-14T12:27:00.000Z	nickrud	mechatronic	glibc is known as libc6 on ubuntu
2006-04-14T12:28:00.000Z	nickrud	mechatronic	there's a lot of repos available, see below
2006-04-14T12:29:00.000Z	nickrud	mechatronic	sudo apt-get remove <mplayer> before you do anything
2006-04-14T12:29:00.000Z	nickrud	mechatronic	and any other rpm's you installed
2006-04-14T12:29:00.000Z	mechatronic	nickrud	yep
2006-04-14T12:59:00.000Z	nickrud	mechatronic	the next command you wanna explore is apt-cache, you'll be able to find the packages you want
