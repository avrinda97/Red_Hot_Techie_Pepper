2009-09-30T02:22:00.000Z	usertwo		how did this happen!!? I deleted the .evolution folder from the home directory. I then reinstalled evolution from synaptic and when I started evolution all my old info and settings were back! where does evolution store the 'settings' file so I can delete it and start a fresh 'first time wizard' start??
2009-09-30T02:24:00.000Z	DasEi	usertwo	sudo apt-get remove --purge evolution to kill config, too (heh, and backup mail before)
2009-09-30T02:25:00.000Z	usertwo	DasEi	thanks, let me try that...
2009-09-30T02:25:00.000Z	DasEi	usertwo	sudo apt-get install evolution afterwards
2009-09-30T02:29:00.000Z	usertwo	DasEi	I just tried what you suggested...even copied and pasted your text...but no...settings and info are all back. did I need to restart somewhere?
2009-09-30T02:33:00.000Z	DasEi	usertwo	strange, try : http://paste.ubuntu.com/281680/
2009-09-30T02:36:00.000Z	usertwo	DasEi	i will try that, but should there be a settings file somewhere, since evolution now backs-up and restores settings? if i delete that and start evolution, it wont find a settings file and should start the wizard to create one?
2009-09-30T02:41:00.000Z	usertwo	DasEi	it says changes will take place after all current x sessions have ended. is it safe to log out?
2009-09-30T02:42:00.000Z	DasEi	usertwo	: NO !
2009-09-30T02:42:00.000Z	usertwo	DasEi	so now do I do sudo apt-get install .....?
2009-09-30T02:42:00.000Z	DasEi	usertwo	: can you please pastebin what else was removed ? don't kill your system ! need all back ..
2009-09-30T02:44:00.000Z	DasEi	usertwo	right, and look in your terminal what else had gone, seems to be it removed more then just my paste ( whole desktop ?!)
2009-09-30T02:44:00.000Z	usertwo	DasEi	i just copied and pasted what you put in the paste bin, but for some reason a 'thunderbird' package got removed
2009-09-30T02:45:00.000Z	DasEi	usertwo	just that additional package ? that won't cause harm, but sure, we killed a lib it needs
2009-09-30T02:47:00.000Z	usertwo	DasEi	i just reinstalled everything I removed. system seems ok. no change to evolution.
2009-09-30T02:47:00.000Z	usertwo	DasEi	ok...
2009-09-30T02:50:00.000Z	usertwo	DasEi	i reinstalled evolution. still no change. I checked the forums, no help
2009-09-30T03:01:00.000Z	DasEi	usertwo	hm, it's not configured in /etc  but in /usr/share/evolution/  , so give it a try purge just evolution (the one), them remove the whole evolution dir with subdirs, then reinstall
