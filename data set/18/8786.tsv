2007-12-23T00:56:00.000Z	ParanoyaM	ompaul	sorry
2007-12-23T00:56:00.000Z	ompaul	ParanoyaM	you did not do what it said on that web page
2007-12-23T00:57:00.000Z	ParanoyaM	ompaul	what is that?
2007-12-23T00:57:00.000Z	ompaul	ParanoyaM	http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/iptables-mac-address-filtering.html  this will tell you
2007-12-23T00:59:00.000Z	ParanoyaM	ompaul	you mean that i am using postrouting?
2007-12-23T01:00:00.000Z	ompaul	ParanoyaM	This is what I pointed at (this is the third time I pointed at it) http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/iptables-mac-address-filtering.html
2007-12-23T01:01:00.000Z	ParanoyaM	ompaul	i read it but i am not sure, i am clear , i am newbie in this, can you tell me what i am doing wrong?
2007-12-23T01:01:00.000Z	ompaul	ParanoyaM	why are you including an IP address? that is what you are doing wrong
2007-12-23T01:02:00.000Z	ParanoyaM	ompaul	so there is no need to point IP?
2007-12-23T01:02:00.000Z	ompaul	ParanoyaM	you are doing something that you were not told to do - so I can't see how I can help you with that, just do the part that is on that page and it will filter based on that mac address

2007-12-23T01:06:00.000Z	ParanoyaM	ompaul	is this correct?
2008-06-22T12:26:00.000Z	ParanoyaM	ompaul	i didn't trash, because i installed new it and then made grub-install /dev/sdc, and now i can't boot it
