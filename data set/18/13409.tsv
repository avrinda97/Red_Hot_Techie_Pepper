2006-06-03T12:09:00.000Z	kaputtu		hey, sudo emacs & asks for the password which is not masked. How do I mask it?
2006-06-03T12:09:00.000Z	sethk	kaputtu	no such thi8ng
2006-06-03T12:10:00.000Z	sethk	kaputtu	which password?
2006-06-03T12:10:00.000Z	kaputtu	sethk	root password
2006-06-03T12:11:00.000Z	sethk	kaputtu	that's bizarre.
2006-06-03T12:11:00.000Z	sethk	kaputtu	the TERM variable must be wrong
2006-06-03T12:12:00.000Z	sethk	kaputtu	you can  do visudo  and change it to not require the password for that program, which is a quick way to hack around it
2006-06-03T12:12:00.000Z	sethk	kaputtu	of course you can just su to become root
2006-06-03T12:12:00.000Z	kaputtu	sethk	no I don't want a hack
2006-06-03T12:12:00.000Z	sethk	kaputtu	then you'll have to figure out how your configuration got totally borked
2006-06-03T12:12:00.000Z	sethk	kaputtu	because passwords are, of course, not echoed
2006-06-03T12:12:00.000Z	kaputtu	sethk	it's been like that always
2006-06-03T12:13:00.000Z	sethk	kaputtu	so it's been borked from the beginning.  not really relevant.  I have 12 ubuntu systems here at the moment, and none of them echo passwords
2006-06-03T12:13:00.000Z	kaputtu	sethk	when you open a program in the background?
2006-06-03T12:14:00.000Z	sethk	kaputtu	foreground, background, doesn't matter.
2006-06-03T12:15:00.000Z	sethk	kaputtu	what's happening is that it believes that it has disabled echo.  that's why I said that the terminal configuration must be incorrect.
2006-06-03T12:15:00.000Z	kaputtu	sethk	I have the defautl configuration
2006-06-03T12:16:00.000Z	sethk	kaputtu	what happens if you run sudo  (no args, just sudo)?
