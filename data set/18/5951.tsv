2008-07-26T11:01:00.000Z	l337ingDisorder	nickrud	Hey you were just helping me with screensavers... I checked in /usr/share/applications/screensavers/ and there are a bunch of .desktop files that look like what I might be supposed to delete...
2008-07-26T11:01:00.000Z	nickrud	l337ingDisorder	yeah, did you see my last to you? Pointed at that one ;)
2008-07-26T11:01:00.000Z	l337ingDisorder	nickrud	I tried moving them to ../bak, logged out, and logged back in... they still show up in the screensaver list
2008-07-26T11:02:00.000Z	l337ingDisorder	nickrud	Yep that's why I'm addressing you specifically this time around ;)
2008-07-26T11:02:00.000Z	nickrud	l337ingDisorder	try removing all but 2, and setting random, see what happens
2008-07-26T11:03:00.000Z	l337ingDisorder	nickrud	ok hold on
2008-07-26T11:03:00.000Z	nickrud	l337ingDisorder	I'm in and out tonight
2008-07-26T11:07:00.000Z	l337ingDisorder	nickrud	ok tried moving all into ../bak then moving three back into .
2008-07-26T11:07:00.000Z	l337ingDisorder	nickrud	now screensaver will only display Xlyap
2008-07-26T11:07:00.000Z	nickrud	l337ingDisorder	then you're on the right path
2008-07-26T11:07:00.000Z	l337ingDisorder	nickrud	although all of them still show up in the list and the little mini-preview for all of them works
2008-07-26T11:08:00.000Z	nickrud	l337ingDisorder	that's probably due to the xml files we looked at earlier
2008-07-26T11:12:00.000Z	l337ingDisorder	nickrud	ok tried moving all the .xml files and replacing the ones that have .desktop files left in the apps dir
2008-07-26T11:12:00.000Z	l337ingDisorder	nickrud	same result
2008-07-26T11:12:00.000Z	nickrud	l337ingDisorder	not sure then. It's an interesting exercise ;)
2008-07-26T11:13:00.000Z	nickrud	l337ingDisorder	it could be you would need to restart gnome-session, or gnome-screensaver if it's running as a daemon
2009-02-21T01:01:00.000Z	nickrud	l337ingDisorder	they have replacement keycaps you can buy ...
2009-02-21T01:02:00.000Z	l337ingDisorder	nickrud	I wonder if any of them have the superman logo... ;)
