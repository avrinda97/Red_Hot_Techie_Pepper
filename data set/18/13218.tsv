2006-01-01T16:25:00.000Z	SweetestSavage		Is there a GUI application that can unRAR?
2006-01-01T16:26:00.000Z	holycow	SweetestSavage	archiver can unrar, just install rar
2006-01-01T16:26:00.000Z	SweetestSavage	holycow	- I installed unrar-free and Archive Manager still calls it an unknown format =/
2006-01-01T16:26:00.000Z	SweetestSavage	holycow	sudo apt-get install rar-free ?
2006-01-01T16:28:00.000Z	holycow	SweetestSavage	give it a go, it's been a bit since i bothered looking up the package name
2006-01-01T16:29:00.000Z	SweetestSavage	holycow	no-go.. I'm not sure what the package name is, I'm searching it with synaptic..
2006-01-01T16:29:00.000Z	SweetestSavage	holycow	however.. searching for "rar" gives me an enormous list of packages x.X
2006-01-01T16:30:00.000Z	holycow	SweetestSavage	just install it already :) you can always apt-get remove --purge package name later
2006-01-01T16:31:00.000Z	SweetestSavage	holycow	no I can't find the package name, I meant. rar-free isn't it. There isn't a package in the repos that starts with "rar", however there is an unrar-free one that I installed, but Archive manager still calls .rar formats as unknown
2006-01-01T16:32:00.000Z	SweetestSavage	holycow	nonexistent. And yes, all repos are enabled
2006-01-01T16:33:00.000Z	SweetestSavage	holycow	says this: E: Package unrar-nonfree has no installation candidate
2006-01-01T16:34:00.000Z	holycow	SweetestSavage	there is a package called rar ... do this
2006-01-01T16:34:00.000Z	holycow	SweetestSavage	just as a point of interest, try using synaptic to search
2006-01-01T16:34:00.000Z	SweetestSavage	holycow	I did try that =P It gives me too large of a list to look through
2006-01-01T16:34:00.000Z	holycow	SweetestSavage	it's organized alphabetically?
2006-01-01T16:35:00.000Z	SweetestSavage	holycow	yes.. I looked for "rar", it isn't there.
2006-01-01T16:35:00.000Z	holycow	SweetestSavage	you screwed somethign up
2006-01-01T16:39:00.000Z	SweetestSavage	holycow	Stormx2, got it working. Thanks guys
