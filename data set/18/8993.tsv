2008-01-04T01:22:00.000Z	PurpZeY	silent_	It is.
2008-01-04T01:22:00.000Z	PurpZeY	silent_	He's got no connectivity
2008-01-04T01:22:00.000Z	PurpZeY	silent_	Although I don't see anything glaringly wrong w/ his ifconfig
2008-01-04T01:23:00.000Z	silent_	PurpZeY	no, the output is normal
2008-01-04T01:25:00.000Z	PurpZeY	silent_	My most recent update on it was the one you caught, that he couldn't even ping it
2008-01-04T01:25:00.000Z	silent_	PurpZeY	I'm guessing the ip isn't 0.1 then, one sec
2008-01-04T01:29:00.000Z	PurpZeY	silent_	Looks like .0.1 is default
2008-01-04T01:38:00.000Z	PurpZeY	silent_	I considered i
2008-01-04T01:44:00.000Z	PurpZeY	silent_	Hopefully you'll get that all resolved soon, but I am glad it isn't too simple, makes me feel like less of an idiot for not seeing it at first glance
2008-01-04T01:44:00.000Z	silent_	PurpZeY	I have no idea what's wrong
2008-01-04T01:44:00.000Z	PurpZeY	silent_	Makes two of us
2008-01-04T01:51:00.000Z	silent_	PurpZeY	all the new ones look like that...
2008-01-04T01:51:00.000Z	PurpZeY	silent_	Take a loot at upper right...Either that's a really good theme or that's a screen from his windows machine
2008-01-04T01:52:00.000Z	PurpZeY	silent_	Maybe it's a good theme....looks like XP to me.
2008-01-04T01:53:00.000Z	silent_	PurpZeY	no, if it looks like xp it's a bad theme
2008-01-04T01:55:00.000Z	PurpZeY	silent_	Only b/c I'm looking at that thinking "Hmm, what are fixing?"
2008-01-04T01:56:00.000Z	silent_	PurpZeY	I can't help but wonder if he knocked out the cat5 cable
2008-01-04T01:56:00.000Z	PurpZeY	silent_	Just wondering that now?
