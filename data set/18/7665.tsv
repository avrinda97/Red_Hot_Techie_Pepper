2007-12-15T08:45:00.000Z	ubuntuisloved		Has anyone had experience moving from Gnome to XFCE desktop? Im interested in copying my startmenu over ?
2007-12-15T08:46:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	ubuntuisloved	Yes I have.
2007-12-15T08:46:00.000Z	ubuntuisloved	Odd-rationale	what did you use to copy the info over so i dont have to hand build the menu items
2007-12-15T08:47:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	ubuntuisloved	Configuring your menu in xfce (xubuntu) menus is a bit different than gnome's
2007-12-15T08:47:00.000Z	ubuntuisloved	Odd-rationale	is there a way to convert my items from gnome to xfce for the start menu?
2007-12-15T08:48:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	ubuntuisloved	You don't have a separate Places and System menu. Inother words, System is a submenu of applictions.
2007-12-15T08:48:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	ubuntuisloved	do you plan to install xubuntu?
2007-12-15T08:48:00.000Z	ubuntuisloved		no i had ubuntu and wanted to experience the xfce as its lighter on mem
2007-12-15T08:48:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	ubuntuisloved	Or do you want xfce on top of your ubuntu installation?
2007-12-15T08:49:00.000Z	ubuntuisloved	Odd-rationale	Ive already installed xfce on top of ubuntu im in it now
2007-12-15T08:49:00.000Z	ubuntuisloved	Odd-rationale	I need to get my menu items over from gnome menu
2007-12-15T08:50:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	ubuntuisloved	I'm afraid your menus will have to edited pretty much by hand. How is your xfce menu now? Is it OK?
2007-12-15T08:50:00.000Z	ubuntuisloved	Odd-rationale	just empty right now ive got a ton of programs to put on it
2007-12-15T08:51:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	ubuntuisloved	Oh, I see. Do you have a ~./config/xfce4/desktop/menu file ( i think that is the correct path)?
2007-12-15T08:53:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	ubuntuisloved	Find it?
2007-12-15T08:53:00.000Z	ubuntuisloved	Odd-rationale	looking now sorry
