2008-12-25T13:44:00.000Z	ronhalfdanr		and of course it won't let me create new folders or rename old ones
2008-12-25T13:44:00.000Z	ronhalfdanr		why is it every other updates screws this basic function and what I have already setup how I want it up?
2008-12-25T13:46:00.000Z	ronhalfdanr		it's stupid things like updates hosing already set permissions that make people go back to windows
2008-12-25T13:47:00.000Z	ronhalfdanr		basic operating system keeps "breaking" when they update it
2008-12-25T13:48:00.000Z	ronhalfdanr		I'd really much rather be getting work done than fixing stupid problems
2008-12-25T13:49:00.000Z	ronhalfdanr		and I thought only Adobe crap screwed with your filesystem
2008-12-25T13:50:00.000Z	ronhalfdanr		I have made NO changes to my permissions
2008-12-25T13:50:00.000Z	dr_willis	ronhalfdanr	 perhaps its time to resummarize the original problem to the channel. Ive totally lost  what the actual problem is or was.    But I do have  a short attention span Today.. Too much EggNog.
2008-12-25T13:51:00.000Z	ronhalfdanr	dr_willis	the problem is as usual the latest update changed most of my permissions
2008-12-25T13:53:00.000Z	dr_willis	ronhalfdanr	 perhaps a log of what commands you are trying and doing may helop the channel in  diagoosing what it is going on. and help in filing a bug repport.
2008-12-25T14:04:00.000Z	dr_willis	ronhalfdanr	 just for clarification - what filesystem is the datadrive anyway? NTFS? Ext2? ext3?
2008-12-25T14:04:00.000Z	dr_willis	ronhalfdanr	 then the permissions must be set by the mountpoint options. NOT the chown or chmod commands....
2008-12-25T14:11:00.000Z	ronhalfdanr	dr_willis	 the drive appears to mount fine, problem is since the last update
2008-12-25T14:12:00.000Z	dr_willis	ronhalfdanr	 with NTFS the modes and owndership are  NOT changed with  chown/chmod - it must be mounted properly to allow users to access it fully. becasue ntfs does NOT support the normal linux style ownership/permissions. thats proberly the core of the whole problem
2008-12-25T14:12:00.000Z	dr_willis	ronhalfdanr	 the permissions dident change.. how it is geting mounted. changed.
2008-12-25T14:13:00.000Z	ronhalfdanr	dr_willis	 the crive mounted just fine
2008-12-25T14:13:00.000Z	dr_willis	ronhalfdanr	 you are confusing mounting   with 'mounting with the proper options  for users.'
2008-12-25T14:15:00.000Z	dr_willis	ronhalfdanr	    given you dident even know what 'ls -l' did. excuse me for not taking your 'word' on that statement.   You may want to pastebin your 'fstab' file for slart to see also.
