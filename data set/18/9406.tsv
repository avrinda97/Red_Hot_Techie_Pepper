2007-05-10T09:01:00.000Z	Yggdrasil		hello guys, im about to perform a reinstallation and ive backup up my /home folder is there any other thing that i might want to back up before i do this ?
2007-05-10T09:01:00.000Z	Yggdrasil		and gals
2007-05-10T09:01:00.000Z	cblack0	Yggdrasil	I'd back up /etc
2007-05-10T09:02:00.000Z	cblack0	Yggdrasil	it is small and could come in handy
2007-05-10T09:02:00.000Z	Yggdrasil		hmm
2007-05-10T09:02:00.000Z	Yggdrasil		intersting
2007-05-10T09:02:00.000Z	Yggdrasil		ok
2007-05-10T09:02:00.000Z	cblack0	Yggdrasil	just for reference really, not to copy it back. Just to check against if something isn't working or copy back selected configs maybe
2007-05-10T09:02:00.000Z	Yggdrasil		uh huh good idea, thats the sort of input i was looking for
2007-05-10T09:03:00.000Z	Yggdrasil		hekcm aybe /usr for that case ?
2007-05-10T09:03:00.000Z	cblack0	Yggdrasil	nah, /usr is all installed software which will get reinstalled. No config or user data in there.
2007-05-10T09:03:00.000Z	cblack0		can't hurt, but I doubt you'd use it
2007-05-10T09:03:00.000Z	Yggdrasil		ok
2007-05-10T09:03:00.000Z	Yggdrasil		great thanks
2007-05-10T09:04:00.000Z	Yggdrasil		dam, im on a t1 and the ubuntu cd is stillonly 82k/s
2007-05-10T09:04:00.000Z	Yggdrasil		:(
2007-05-10T09:04:00.000Z	cblack0	Yggdrasil	if you compiled some stuff by hand in /usr maybe back that up, if it all just came from a regular install just /home and /etc is usually fine. Maybe /var if you want to retain logs
2007-05-10T09:04:00.000Z	Yggdrasil	cblack0	yes compiled stuff
