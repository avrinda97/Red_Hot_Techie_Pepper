2006-05-24T09:34:00.000Z	cil3urn	rggjan	I would say yes if your trying to backup your bootsector
2006-05-24T09:34:00.000Z	cil3urn	rggjan	are you afraid to install grub?
2006-05-24T09:35:00.000Z	cil3urn	rggjan	did you ever backup the bootsector?
2006-05-24T09:36:00.000Z	cil3urn	rggjan	I would say copy original to backup and than. Use the backup to restore it
2006-05-24T09:38:00.000Z	cil3urn	rggjan	Im not to sure about that....
2006-05-24T09:42:00.000Z	cil3urn	rggjan	do you speak german by anychance?
2006-05-24T09:47:00.000Z	cil3urn	rggjan	I cannot find any specific channels but maybe this will help you; http://www.murga.org/~puppy/viewtopic.php?t=3395&view=next&sid=0b464e7dfa8aa69eb536b8100271e74d
2006-05-24T09:48:00.000Z	cil3urn	rggjan	have you tried the man page
2006-05-24T09:51:00.000Z	cil3urn	rggjan	yes but a util like this will move data off of it (or as much as possible) and put it on a good sector
2006-05-24T09:52:00.000Z	cil3urn	rggjan	there seems to be nooo documentation to backing up or restoring with that specific util
