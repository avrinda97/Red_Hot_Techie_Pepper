2011-05-09T00:25:00.000Z	Note-book		ever since I've upgraded to 11.04, my system just hangs at times when I'm opening a heavy page e.g. the Nike store's flash website. Just now, I ran a game and it was stuck so I had to unplug my computer then. My system has a NVidia card and while it worked fine on 10.10, it says it's NOT ACTIVE in 11.04
2011-05-09T00:26:00.000Z	Note-book		anyone? :(
2011-05-09T00:27:00.000Z	LAcan	Note-book	you have to enable third party drivers
2011-05-09T00:27:00.000Z	LAcan	Note-book	go to "Additional Drivers" in your system menu
2011-05-09T00:28:00.000Z	Note-book	LAcan	how do I do that? I have the driver downloaded but it says it's not active and there's no option to do so unlike 10.10
2011-05-09T00:28:00.000Z	LAcan	Note-book	first you learn to read. the answer is ^^
2011-05-09T00:29:00.000Z	Note-book	LAcan	I read properly but despite the driver downloaded, it says "ACTIVE BUT NOT IN USE"
2011-05-09T00:29:00.000Z	LAcan	Note-book	YOU GO TO "ADDITIONAL DRIVERS" IN SYSTEM AND INSTALL IT THAT WAY
2011-05-09T00:30:00.000Z	Note-book	LAcan	I have done it that way. It says ACTIVE BUT NOT IN USE. Do you get that?
2011-05-09T00:30:00.000Z	LAcan	Note-book	did you enable third party drivers thru additional drivers.. its a checkbox or something
