2011-09-11T01:59:00.000Z	pureevol		im running ubuntu 11.04 and i made the mistake of not increasing the size of the partition. can i change the size without reformating?
2011-09-11T02:00:00.000Z	usr13	pureevol	yes
2011-09-11T02:01:00.000Z	usr13	pureevol	Boot the LiveCD and use gparted to resize partition(s).
2011-09-11T02:02:00.000Z	usr13	pureevol	LiveCD=Install-CD
2011-09-11T02:02:00.000Z	usr13	pureevol	How did you install Ubuntu 11.04?
2011-09-11T02:03:00.000Z	usr13	pureevol	What method did you use to install Ubuntu 11.04?
2011-09-11T02:04:00.000Z	usr13	pureevol	Maybe you should re-state your question. (I am not sure I understand.)
2011-09-11T02:04:00.000Z	usr13	pureevol	Did you install from Ubuntu CD?
2011-09-11T02:05:00.000Z	usr13	pureevol	What did you download from ubuntu.com?  An ISO?
2011-09-11T02:06:00.000Z	usr13	pureevol	And did you burn this ISO image to a CD?
2011-09-11T02:06:00.000Z	usr13	pureevol	Oh, you installed wubi ?
2011-09-11T02:06:00.000Z	usr13	pureevol	How did you install it?  From a CD?
2011-09-11T02:07:00.000Z	usr13	pureevol	Oh, ok. Just a sec.
2011-09-11T02:07:00.000Z	usr13	pureevol	What version of MS Windows do you have?
2011-09-11T02:08:00.000Z	usr13	pureevol	Oh ok.  Then this is what you  need: http://gparted.sourceforge.net/livecd.php
2011-09-11T02:11:00.000Z	usr13	pureevol	Yes, boot to the CD and you will be presented with a non-destructive partition manager called gparted.
2011-09-11T02:12:00.000Z	usr13	pureevol	But I recommend that you boot to MS Windows first and back any critical data and do defrag before attempting to re-size the MS Windows partition (assuming you are going to shrink it).
2011-09-11T02:13:00.000Z	usr13	pureevol	It is a relatively save proceedure, but...
