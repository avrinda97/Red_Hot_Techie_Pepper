2009-11-15T05:35:00.000Z	Wallace		next question:  i'm trying to download an installer iso from www.ubuntu.com, but it is offering me the iso for my desktop's architecture which is not i386.  how do I manually select the architecture to download from the site?
2009-11-15T05:35:00.000Z	Wallace		stevenking:  find -name "xxx" -o -type f -print    I think
2009-11-15T05:36:00.000Z	Wallace		...i.e. -o means "or" and doesn't do the actions that match what is before it....sort of...not a great explanation
2009-11-15T05:36:00.000Z	ardchoille	Wallace	you need a path for that find comand
2009-11-15T05:36:00.000Z	Wallace	ardchoille	oops    yeah  find /path -name "exclude-me" -o -type f -print
2009-11-15T05:47:00.000Z	ardchoille	Wallace	on karmic there is no menu.lst file, at least there wasn't on mine
2009-11-22T04:53:00.000Z	ardchoille	Wallace	it's still around :)
2009-11-22T08:22:00.000Z	ardchoille	Wallace	It is a windows file
2009-11-29T06:09:00.000Z	ardchoille	Wallace	That setting is in the Login Window gui
2009-11-29T06:09:00.000Z	Wallace	ardchoille	I can't change the settings once I'm logged in?
2009-11-29T06:10:00.000Z	ardchoille	Wallace	yes, it's in System > Administration > Login Window in the Accessibility tab
2009-11-29T06:11:00.000Z	ardchoille	Wallace	under "Sounds"
2009-11-29T06:11:00.000Z	Wallace	ardchoille	I have only System -> Admin -> Login Screen which only has settings for enabling automatic login - no tabs of any kind, just two radio buttons
2009-11-29T06:12:00.000Z	ardchoille	Wallace	Are you on Karmic?
2009-11-29T06:12:00.000Z	Wallace	ardchoille	can't remember the names, I'm on 9.10
2009-11-29T06:12:00.000Z	ardchoille	Wallace	That's Karmic. It seems they've changed that since Jaunty. Sorry about that.
2009-11-29T06:15:00.000Z	Wallace	ardchoille	...and I couldn't see anything in sound preferences either
2009-11-29T06:15:00.000Z	ardchoille	Wallace	Maybe that change has something to do with the way Karmic handles things, many things are different than in Jaunty
