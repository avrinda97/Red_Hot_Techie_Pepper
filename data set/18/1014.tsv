2011-07-03T22:58:00.000Z	ubrocks		Hi, I cannot switch between workspaces. Can somebody help?
2011-07-03T23:00:00.000Z	jefelex	ubrocks	- how many workspaces do you have defined?
2011-07-03T23:00:00.000Z	ubrocks	jefelex	I find all of this quite difficult. I believe I have 4 workspaces
2011-07-03T23:01:00.000Z	jefelex	ubrocks	- I guess the 4 workspaces are in your panel?
2011-07-03T23:02:00.000Z	ubrocks	jefelex	I see four little squares in the panel, next to the trash icon
2011-07-03T23:02:00.000Z	ubrocks	jefelex	in three of them there are windows
2011-07-03T23:02:00.000Z	ubrocks	jefelex	three of them have an orange icon. I previously chose: Move to workspace1, 2, 3
2011-07-03T23:03:00.000Z	ubrocks	jefelex	the problem is that I cannot switch between those workspaces :-(
2011-07-03T23:04:00.000Z	ubrocks	jefelex	I have three different windows open in three different workspaces, but I cannot switch between them. I remember that with previous versions I could simply click on one of them and that would show the workspace
2011-07-03T23:05:00.000Z	ubrocks	jefelex	11.04
2011-07-03T23:05:00.000Z	ubrocks	jefelex	I'm using gnome
2011-07-03T23:08:00.000Z	ubrocks	jefelex	where are you???
2011-07-03T23:09:00.000Z	ubrocks	jefelex	yes, nothing happens.
2011-07-03T23:12:00.000Z	jefelex	ubrocks	- try ctnl alt left arrow and see if that changes your desktoop
2011-07-03T23:12:00.000Z	ubrocks	jefelex	ok
2011-07-03T23:13:00.000Z	ubrocks	jefelex	nothing
2011-07-03T23:13:00.000Z	ubrocks	jefelex	brb...
2011-07-03T23:18:00.000Z	ubrocks	jefelex	I installed compiz. Could it be that it screwed things up?
