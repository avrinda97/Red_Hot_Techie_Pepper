2007-02-03T08:47:00.000Z	mitch_		I am trying to mount a windows disc so I can retrieve the info off of it. I tried mkdir /mnt/win and I got the permission denied response.
2007-02-03T08:48:00.000Z	kitche	mitch_	sudo mkdir /media/win
2007-02-03T09:00:00.000Z	kitche	mitch_	hda1 is ide drive and sda1 is either usb drive or a scsi drive or SATA drive
2007-02-03T09:10:00.000Z	kitche	mitch_	probably /dev/sdb1
2007-02-03T09:35:00.000Z	mitch_	kitche	chmod -R /media/win    What am I missing. It says I am missing an operand?
2007-02-03T09:35:00.000Z	kitche	mitch_	your missing the user that will own the directory
2007-02-03T09:37:00.000Z	kitche	mitch_	whatever your user is that you log on as
2007-02-03T09:38:00.000Z	kitche	mitch_	chown -R mitche /media/win but umask would be easier
2007-02-03T09:41:00.000Z	kitche	mitch_	by change what is your toher drive?
2007-02-03T09:41:00.000Z	kitche	mitch_	like the filesystem of it
2007-02-03T09:42:00.000Z	kitche	mitch_	ok you trying to jsut read it right? or you want write support
2007-02-03T09:43:00.000Z	kitche	mitch_	ok you probably need to use umask then
2007-02-03T09:44:00.000Z	mitch_	kitche	Thanks..I will likely be back. Have patience with me.
2007-02-03T09:45:00.000Z	mitch_	kitche	before I do his will I have to unmount what I already did??
2007-02-03T09:45:00.000Z	kitche	mitch_	well I would just to start fresh
2007-02-03T09:46:00.000Z	kitche	mitch_	just umount the drive

2007-02-03T09:58:00.000Z	mitch_	kitche	Ended up using that script. I guess I didn't learn much, but it worked. Thanks.
