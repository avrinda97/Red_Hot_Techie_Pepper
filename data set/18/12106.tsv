2006-05-28T09:22:00.000Z	nickrud	dou213	you'll actually need to go to http://gnome.org/learn/ on the net
2006-05-31T16:46:00.000Z	nickrud	dou213	debconf has low, medium, high and critical flags, they determine the level of questions asked
2006-05-31T16:47:00.000Z	dou213	nickrud	debconf? i'm new to linux ... what is this?
2006-05-31T16:48:00.000Z	nickrud	dou213	its a tool used by packages for asking questions about how you want your package configured.
2006-05-31T16:49:00.000Z	nickrud	dou213	during the initial install, debconf is set to high(critical) so very few questions are asked; when you do dpkg-reconfigure on the command line it defaults to low, so 'every' question is asked
2006-05-31T16:50:00.000Z	dou213	nickrud	initial install of what?
2006-05-31T16:50:00.000Z	nickrud	dou213	of ubuntu, when you boot from the cd & install
2006-05-31T16:53:00.000Z	dou213	nickrud	ok, so debconf sets how many questions a user is confrunted with during an installation
2006-05-31T16:53:00.000Z	nickrud	dou213	precisely
2006-05-31T16:54:00.000Z	dou213	nickrud	in any linux distro?
2006-05-31T16:54:00.000Z	nickrud	dou213	no, it's a debian/ubuntu thing. I assume other debian based distros use it also
2006-05-31T16:55:00.000Z	dou213	nickrud	and skippy81, thx for help
2006-05-31T16:55:00.000Z	nickrud	dou213	yw
2009-02-01T07:48:00.000Z	nickrud	dou213	you would be telling the router to forward inbound port 80 traffic specifically to the ubuntu computer; no other machine would recieve that traffic
2009-02-01T07:49:00.000Z	dou213	nickrud	ok thx
