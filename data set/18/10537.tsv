2009-01-24T02:42:00.000Z	keith		totem is using 50% or more of my CPU, but is not actively open. It is showing as "Uninterruptible" and will not respond to kill signals. Can someone please advise?
2009-01-24T02:44:00.000Z	keith		kill -9 will not kill the process. I have never had this happen before.
2009-01-24T02:45:00.000Z	keith		How can a process be Uninterruptible such that kill -9 doesn't work?
2009-01-24T02:45:00.000Z	Slart	keith	several ways.. NOHUP is one wat
2009-01-24T02:46:00.000Z	Slart	keith	although I'm not sure if using NOHUP makes it "uninterruptible" in htop and such
2009-01-24T02:46:00.000Z	keith	Slart	pike_: But this is totem... should it be running short of me opening it to play a video?
2009-01-24T02:47:00.000Z	Slart	keith	not that I know of
2009-01-24T02:48:00.000Z	keith	Slart	My CPU is at 100% at it is using half of that, is there a way to kill it? or see what is blocking me?
2009-01-24T02:49:00.000Z	Slart	keith	hmm.. if it's uninterruptable I don't really know how to kill it, sorry
2009-04-05T03:04:00.000Z	Slart	keith	you're welcome to try here.. but I've got a feeling you might get better answers somewhere else.. #linux perhaps?
2009-04-05T03:05:00.000Z	keith	Slart	good thinking. thanks.
2009-04-05T03:18:00.000Z	Slart	keith	unless you're trying to squeeze extra battery time out of a laptop.. or running something very special I doubt you'll gain much by compiling your own
2009-04-05T03:18:00.000Z	keith	Slart	Thanks
2009-05-09T14:02:00.000Z	keith	Slart	Because apparently too many people hit it by accident.
2009-05-09T14:04:00.000Z	keith	Slart	painted: You could restart X with "sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart"
2009-05-09T14:06:00.000Z	keith	Slart	I suppose you could also go to run level 3 to kill X, lol. Not exactly a good way to do it though.
2009-05-09T14:06:00.000Z	Slart	keith	isn't runlevel 3 the standard runlevel in ubuntu?
2009-05-09T14:07:00.000Z	keith	Slart	yeah, what he said
