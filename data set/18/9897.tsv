2007-02-24T13:56:00.000Z	Steve^		I ask becuase installing gnome to my old kde-suse only lead to trouble
2007-02-24T13:57:00.000Z	Steve^		But that requires the programs to respect my choice :P
2007-02-24T13:57:00.000Z	Steve^		I'm planning to switch to KDE and may aswell reinstall as it's fresh anyway, I'm just wondering if I should try Debian
2007-02-24T13:58:00.000Z	Steve^		does Debian have the same 6 month package structure?
2007-02-24T13:58:00.000Z	Steve^		ok, I'd prefer that
2007-02-24T13:59:00.000Z	Steve^		I dislike having to download outside of the package manager to have the new stuff
2007-02-24T13:59:00.000Z	Steve^		umm, ok...
2007-02-24T13:59:00.000Z	cables	Steve^	I just got back  here, but if you want to install KDE, just do "sudo aptitude install kubuntu-desktop"
2007-04-28T08:18:00.000Z	cables	Steve^	use an Ubuntu LiveCD
2007-04-28T08:18:00.000Z	Steve^	cables	and run gparted within it?
2007-04-28T08:18:00.000Z	cables	Steve^	yep

2007-04-28T08:19:00.000Z	cables	Steve^	you may need to apply changes to your NTFS before you can resize the Ext3.
2007-04-28T08:19:00.000Z	Steve^	cables	fair enough
2007-04-28T08:45:00.000Z	cables	Steve^	you have to apply the changes first.
