2008-12-29T09:46:00.000Z	nibsa1242		where is the trash folder located? I need to remove trash from command line b/c the gui doesn't work
2008-12-29T09:47:00.000Z	kurrata	nibsa1242	 /home/martins/.local/share/Trash/files
2008-12-29T09:48:00.000Z	nibsa1242	kurrata	that folder is empty
2008-12-29T09:48:00.000Z	kurrata	nibsa1242	 then your trash should be emty i think
2008-12-29T10:03:00.000Z	nibsa1242	kurrata	Windows needs to think that its boot drive is the master. I think there is a way to tell grub to tell windows that it is the master so that it works ok
2008-12-29T10:04:00.000Z	nibsa1242	kurrata	you need to use the map command in your menu.lst file for grub
2008-12-29T10:05:00.000Z	kurrata	nibsa1242	 used map already ;)
2008-12-29T10:05:00.000Z	nibsa1242	kurrata	then that should work... did you remember to update-grub after changing your menu.lst?
2008-12-29T10:05:00.000Z	kurrata	nibsa1242	 what do you mean by update?
2008-12-29T10:06:00.000Z	nibsa1242	kurrata	what does the windows section of your menu.lst file look like?
2008-12-29T10:06:00.000Z	nibsa1242	kurrata	after you change the menu.lst file you have to run the command "update-grub" to actually update grub
2008-12-29T10:08:00.000Z	nibsa1242	kurrata	you still there?

2008-12-29T10:10:00.000Z	nibsa1242	kurrata	ok, what you need to do is follow directions from: http://blog.firetree.net/2005/08/26/duel-boot-windows-with-grub/  pay attention to the map part under the windows entry
2008-12-29T10:10:00.000Z	kurrata	nibsa1242	 k
2008-12-29T10:11:00.000Z	nibsa1242	kurrata	that tricks windows into thinking its the master drive so it'll boot property... if it doesn't think its the master it refuses to boot
2008-12-29T10:12:00.000Z	kurrata	nibsa1242	 yea, reading it now will try it
2008-12-29T10:12:00.000Z	nibsa1242	kurrata	Ok good. I dual boot, thats how I have mine setup, and it works flawlessly... I've got to go hope that helped.
