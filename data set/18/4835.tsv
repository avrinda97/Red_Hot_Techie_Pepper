2009-02-17T14:25:00.000Z	banttu		I want to get the size of a partition using fdisk -s and pipe it to something so I can get it in human readable format
2009-02-17T14:26:00.000Z	banttu		Anybody with ideas?
2009-02-17T14:26:00.000Z	Favorit	banttu	define human readable
2009-02-17T14:27:00.000Z	Favorit	banttu	fdisk -s gives pretty much human readable format, numbers :)
2009-02-17T14:27:00.000Z	banttu		Megabytes, Gigs Kilobyte
2009-02-17T14:28:00.000Z	banttu	Favorit	lol, I'd read something about using bc but I can't seem to get it working, its a tricky affair piping to bc
2009-02-17T14:28:00.000Z	Favorit	banttu	df -h / | tail -1 | awk '{print $2}' <- would this do? :)
2009-02-17T14:29:00.000Z	Favorit	banttu	replace / with other partition name for other partitions :)
2009-02-17T14:29:00.000Z	banttu	Favorit	I haven't mounted it,
2009-02-17T14:29:00.000Z	Favorit	banttu	ah, i see
2009-02-17T14:30:00.000Z	banttu		I could mount it but that would mean using fdisk would be obfuscated
2009-02-17T14:31:00.000Z	Favorit	banttu	yeah
2009-02-17T14:33:00.000Z	banttu		Ok. Lemmi ask it different
2009-02-17T14:34:00.000Z	banttu		Say you have a command that returns a number
2009-02-17T14:34:00.000Z	Favorit	banttu	this would be another option: parted -s /dev/sda1 print | grep " 1" | awk '{print $3}'
2009-02-17T14:35:00.000Z	Favorit	banttu	or even parted -s /dev/sda1 print | grep "^Disk" | awk '{print $2}'
2009-02-17T14:35:00.000Z	Favorit	banttu	$3 that is
2009-02-17T14:36:00.000Z	Favorit	banttu	and to operate your units you can do it like this: parted -s /dev/sda1 unit MB print | grep "^Disk" | awk '{print $3}'
