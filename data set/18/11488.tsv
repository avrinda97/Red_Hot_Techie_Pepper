2010-09-25T06:13:00.000Z	brandon__		can anyone think of why my nvidia-settings would be missing my resolution?  my two year old son grabs my mouse sometimes and when i came home from work my pc was off, and whne i turned it on it defaulted to 1024x768 (but my highest res is 1600x1200)
2010-09-25T06:13:00.000Z	brandon__		lucid
2010-09-25T06:14:00.000Z	brandon__		should i just delete the xorg.conf? thats the only thing i havent tried yet, and im told its not required anymore
2010-09-25T06:14:00.000Z	brandon__		like i said my son grabs the mouse sometimes, and when i came home it was off
