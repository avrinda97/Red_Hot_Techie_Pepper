2011-08-13T15:01:00.000Z	dr_willis		check that you are still using compiz. ut may have changed to metacity
2011-08-13T15:01:00.000Z	dr_willis		!vpn
2011-08-13T15:02:00.000Z	Plizzo	dr_willis	I do not need information on using a client, I need to get a server running
2011-08-13T15:03:00.000Z	dr_willis	Plizzo	i sousd
2011-08-13T15:03:00.000Z	Plizzo	dr_willis	And I do not have a desktop to work with, only terminal
2012-01-07T23:04:00.000Z	dr_willis	Plizzo	 for a small set of machines. you could just edit the hosts file. assuming they have static ip
2012-01-07T23:05:00.000Z	Plizzo	dr_willis	I do have a rather small home network, but editing the hosts file seems to be a bad option, given that installing a DNS server is probably the best one, and it would work cross-machine
2012-01-07T23:06:00.000Z	Plizzo	dr_willis	I also connect to my server through VPN, and I can only reach the machines in my network through their ip-adresses, and I would like to get name resolving working
2012-01-07T23:06:00.000Z	dr_willis	Plizzo	 assuming you can get the dnsserver working right. :) i just set my home router to do static ips and have about 8 lines in my hosts file.
2012-01-07T23:06:00.000Z	dr_willis	Plizzo	 no idea on vpn. i dont use it.
2012-01-07T23:06:00.000Z	dr_willis	Plizzo	 i just use dyndns and port forwarding to get to differnt machines when away from home.
2012-01-07T23:07:00.000Z	Plizzo	dr_willis	Have you ever set up a DNS on Ubuntu, I found some tuturials, but they all talk about zones etc, and I don't know what that is
2012-01-07T23:07:00.000Z	dr_willis	Plizzo	 now you know why i dont use dns. :) and use the hosts file.
2012-01-07T23:08:00.000Z	Plizzo	dr_willis	I use my server as a file storage, webserver and media machine, and the reason why I run VPN is because I don't want my files to be accesible if someone would get my password. VPN with certificates is much safer
2012-01-07T23:08:00.000Z	Plizzo	dr_willis	I do have Avahi, for bonjour broadcasting, which works, but not over VPN
2012-01-07T23:09:00.000Z	dr_willis	Plizzo	 i just ssh to my machine. i dont get files from it across the internet.. So thats about the extent of my experience.
2012-01-07T23:16:00.000Z	dr_willis	Plizzo	 i imagine setting up a dns server is not going to be a '2 clicks and its done' thing.. you will have to do a little bit of configuring.
