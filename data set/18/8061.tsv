2010-06-24T09:15:00.000Z	lewis1711		just trying to set up wireless. when I input iwconfig, I am told that wlan0 power is off. how do I, er, switch it on?:)
2010-06-24T09:15:00.000Z	puff	lewis1711	ifconfig or ifup, or use gnome network-manager.
2010-06-24T09:16:00.000Z	puff	lewis1711	but be aware, ifconfig and ifup use different lock files, so if you use both, you can get quite confused.
2010-06-24T09:17:00.000Z	lewis1711	puff	I see. am using xubuntu but that channel is dead. guess it's time for some heavy googling
2010-06-24T09:17:00.000Z	puff	lewis1711	Er, not different lock files, but different files to store the current state. So if you turn wlan0 off with ifdown, then try to turn it on with ifconfig, it'll tell you it's already on.
2010-06-24T09:17:00.000Z	puff	lewis1711	I'm more of a shell guy, but most people seem to use the gnome network manager appet.
2010-06-24T09:18:00.000Z	puff	lewis1711	It should be up in your menu bar, usually near the right corner in vanilla ubuntu, and it looks like either a cell phone signal bars indicator (when connected) or like two overlapping PC icons.
2010-06-24T09:18:00.000Z	puff	lewis1711	"sudo ifconfig -a" should show you all of the current details.
2010-06-24T09:19:00.000Z	puff	lewis1711	With ifconfig, ti'd be "sudo ifconfig eth1 up" or "Sudo ifconfig eth1 down".
2010-06-24T09:19:00.000Z	puff	lewis1711	or "sudo ifup eth1" and "sudo ifdown eth1"
2010-06-24T09:19:00.000Z	lewis1711	puff	this is xubuntu, so I don't think I have it. will try and download the gnome thing
2010-06-24T09:19:00.000Z	puff	lewis1711	Er, wlan0, that is... on mine, wifi is eth1.
2010-06-24T09:20:00.000Z	lewis1711		unknown interafce wlan0=wlan0 :/
2010-06-24T09:20:00.000Z	puff	lewis1711	Which version?
2010-06-24T09:20:00.000Z	lewis1711		10.04
2010-06-24T09:20:00.000Z	puff	lewis1711	Some googlnig on: xubuntu  "network manager" turns up a number of hits that suggest xubuntu should have it.
2010-06-24T09:20:00.000Z	lewis1711		what's its bin name?
2010-06-24T09:24:00.000Z	puff	lewis1711	Usually it's in /usr/sbin/NetworkManager
