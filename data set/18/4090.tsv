2009-06-04T19:46:00.000Z	Dr_Phusis		what do you all recommend as the partition setup for a gaming computer? my HDD will be 500Gb, I was thinking of having enough of it partitioned for windows to store my games. But I also want to be able to access them from Ubuntu. Would I be able to play a windows game from my windows partition from wine? I'm just worried because I know it's fine to read from a windows partition using linux, but I heard it could be harmful to write to it, s
2009-06-04T19:47:00.000Z	kwork	Dr_Phusis	you can even write to ntfs, its just not suggested
2009-06-04T19:48:00.000Z	Dr_Phusis	kwork	ok, but does wine handle it differently? I won't be manually writing to it, but wine might, so because it is made to run windows programs those programs would write to the disk in a windows friendly way... right?  or is it a potential problem?
2009-06-04T19:49:00.000Z	Dr_Phusis	kwork	OR, is there a way that I could have a sort of "neutral" partition that is safe for both OS's to read and write to?
2009-06-04T19:49:00.000Z	kwork	Dr_Phusis	sadly windows cant read any other filesystem besides ntfs/fat
2009-06-04T19:50:00.000Z	Dr_Phusis	kwork	ok what about this then, I make 3 partitions, linux, windows, and a third NTFS partition just for games.
2009-06-04T19:50:00.000Z	kwork	Dr_Phusis	i cant say it will never brake, but alot days ago i used wine to run win games on win partition, and i didnot brake anything
2009-06-04T19:50:00.000Z	kwork	Dr_Phusis	and that was like few years ago
2009-06-04T19:51:00.000Z	kwork	Dr_Phusis	if anything windows wanted to checkdisc, didnot brake the filesystem in any case
2009-06-04T19:51:00.000Z	Dr_Phusis	kwork	if it does "break" would that just mess up the partition it's on, or all partitions?
2009-06-04T19:51:00.000Z	kwork	Dr_Phusis	i would think that nowdays with ntfs3g driver on linux, it will not brake
2009-06-04T19:51:00.000Z	kwork	Dr_Phusis	but it wouldnot be safe for production enviroinment, but for home use why not
2009-06-04T19:52:00.000Z	kwork	Dr_Phusis	 in the old days the writing to ntfs was dangerous, thou it did work even then
2009-06-04T19:52:00.000Z	Dr_Phusis	kwork	ok, but just to to clarify, what do we mean by "break"? if it just messes up the partition it's on then I wouldn't worry too much. But if it breaks my HDD, I'd rather not risk it lol.
2009-06-04T19:53:00.000Z	kwork	Dr_Phusis	basicaly if i would be you i would go with two partisions win/linux rather then 3
2009-06-04T19:53:00.000Z	kwork	Dr_Phusis	but its up to you
2009-06-04T19:54:00.000Z	kwork	Dr_Phusis	 the thing is some games want to write to c:\ aswell not only d:\games
2009-06-04T19:54:00.000Z	kwork	Dr_Phusis	so i m not sure will you benefit from 3 parts
