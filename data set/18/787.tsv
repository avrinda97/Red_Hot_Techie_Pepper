2011-09-10T13:07:00.000Z	DaVamps-Ubuntu		does the partition need to be primary or logical?
2011-09-10T13:09:00.000Z	DaVamps-Ubuntu		root for ubuntu correct?
2011-09-10T13:09:00.000Z	DaVamps-Ubuntu		win 7 is my primary hard drive. ubuntu will be secondary.
2011-09-10T13:10:00.000Z	DaVamps-Ubuntu		yes.. both oses are installed on different hd's
2011-09-10T13:10:00.000Z	DaVamps-Ubuntu		ok, so primary.. gotcha.
2011-09-10T13:11:00.000Z	DaVamps-Ubuntu		first mount is /  then swap then /home
2011-09-10T13:11:00.000Z	DaVamps-Ubuntu		so created logical drive for the mounts correct?
2011-09-10T13:13:00.000Z	DaVamps-Ubuntu		use 320gb as primary, how much for swap
2011-09-10T13:14:00.000Z	DaVamps-Ubuntu		primary for / ok, swap is logical? how big
2011-09-10T13:15:00.000Z	DaVamps-Ubuntu		3 gb ram
2011-09-10T13:16:00.000Z	nickmoeck	DaVamps-Ubuntu	if you're not on a laptop, you don't even really need a swap partition
2011-09-10T13:16:00.000Z	DaVamps-Ubuntu	nickmoeck	it is a desktop
2011-09-10T13:18:00.000Z	nickmoeck	DaVamps-Ubuntu	If you're never going to use Hibernate, I'd say nix the swap.
2011-09-10T13:18:00.000Z	nickmoeck	DaVamps-Ubuntu	20GB for /, the rest for /home
2011-09-10T13:19:00.000Z	DaVamps-Ubuntu	nickmoeck	sry. ok...
2011-09-10T13:19:00.000Z	nickmoeck	DaVamps-Ubuntu	yes, ext4 for everything
2011-09-10T13:19:00.000Z	DaVamps-Ubuntu	nickmoeck	ok thanks
2011-09-10T13:20:00.000Z	nickmoeck	DaVamps-Ubuntu	Mine does that too
