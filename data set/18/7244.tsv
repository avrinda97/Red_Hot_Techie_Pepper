2008-01-19T10:05:00.000Z	BoltClock	clearzen	early yesterday i tried envy and it didnt work
2008-01-19T10:07:00.000Z	clearzen	BoltClock	1) apt-get install xorg-driver-fglrx 2) apt-get install nvidia-glx-new  3) sudo envy -t and uninstall nvidia drivers, clean the nvidia drivers, and install them again
2008-01-19T10:07:00.000Z	clearzen	BoltClock	that should work for you
2008-01-19T10:08:00.000Z	BoltClock	clearzen	ill try restarting X first
2008-01-19T10:10:00.000Z	BoltClock	clearzen	will try what you said now... though ive heard envy is unsupported
2008-01-19T10:10:00.000Z	clearzen	BoltClock	it's just building the drivers from source for you.
2008-01-19T10:14:00.000Z	BoltClock	clearzen	could not `sudo envy -t`
2008-01-19T10:15:00.000Z	clearzen	BoltClock	you have to download envy first
