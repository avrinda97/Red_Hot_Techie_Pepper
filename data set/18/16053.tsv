2005-03-15T17:40:00.000Z	britishseapower		How supported are Realtek PCI wifi cards (Realtek RTL8180) in ubuntu? Is anybody running one successfully?
2005-03-15T17:41:00.000Z	britishseapower		that is the chipset! :-)
2005-03-15T17:42:00.000Z	britishseapower		i'd love it if the livecd dhcpd that nic out of the box!
2005-03-15T17:43:00.000Z	fsc	britishseapower	rather
2005-03-15T17:43:00.000Z	fsc	britishseapower	i'm running under a 8180 right now
2005-03-15T17:43:00.000Z	britishseapower	fsc	- yeah ?
2005-03-15T17:44:00.000Z	fsc		hmm...device manager is crashy now
2005-03-15T17:44:00.000Z	britishseapower	fsc	my sister is really not echnical and i want her to try ubuntu on her wifi network...what steps do you need to configure the 8180 with the live cd?
2005-03-15T17:45:00.000Z	fsc	britishseapower	live cd might be tricky.  you'll have to get the windows .inf and .sys driver files, and install ndiswrapper
2005-03-15T17:45:00.000Z	britishseapower	fsc	- k, gotit
2005-03-15T17:45:00.000Z	britishseapower	fsc	- i think i might need a trip down to see her to sort this out
2005-03-15T17:45:00.000Z	fsc	britishseapower	most definitely
2005-03-15T17:45:00.000Z	britishseapower	fsc	- good to know that it does work with ndis wrapper though
2005-03-15T17:46:00.000Z	britishseapower	fsc	catch 22...could ssh in...but no nic no ssh...and vice versa.
2005-03-15T17:46:00.000Z	fsc	britishseapower	heck it works better under ndiswrapper than under windows for me.  windows wants to constantly hop around other wireless networks for me, but probably not a driver problem, but windows wireless management issue
2005-03-15T17:50:00.000Z	britishseapower	fsc	ok...good info
2005-03-15T17:52:00.000Z	britishseapower	fsc	do you know if ndiswrapper comes on the livecd?
2005-03-15T06:02:00.000Z	fsc	britishseapower	not sure. never used it
