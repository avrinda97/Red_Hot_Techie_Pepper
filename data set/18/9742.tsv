2007-06-28T15:31:00.000Z	blazemonger		jordan: can you try to run the molecule screensaver and see if it works?
2007-06-28T15:31:00.000Z	blazemonger		really? it doesn't lock up yourcomputer?
2007-06-28T15:32:00.000Z	blazemonger		i have a fast computer and a fast video card
2007-06-28T15:32:00.000Z	blazemonger		pentium 4 2.4ghz with 768mb of ram, 40 gig hd space, d865perl chipset, i810 onboard audio, and a rage 128 all in wonder
2007-06-28T15:33:00.000Z	blazemonger		yah
2007-06-28T15:33:00.000Z	blazemonger		ati
2007-06-28T15:33:00.000Z	blazemonger		yah
2007-06-28T15:33:00.000Z	blazemonger		cuz it locks up the machine itself
2007-06-28T15:34:00.000Z	blazemonger		the rage 128 card isn't bad
2007-06-28T15:34:00.000Z	blazemonger		and i don't see how a screensaver of al things would lock up
2007-06-28T15:34:00.000Z	crdlb	blazemonger	the rage 128 is ancient
2007-06-28T15:34:00.000Z	blazemonger	crdlb	it might be ancient but it works
2007-06-28T15:35:00.000Z	crdlb	blazemonger	do you even have 3d acceleration?
2007-06-28T15:36:00.000Z	crdlb	blazemonger	just get a slightly newer ati (r100 or r200) or get a very recent nvidia
2007-07-30T11:59:00.000Z	crdlb	blazemonger	kde-core is very minimal
2007-07-30T12:00:00.000Z	crdlb	blazemonger	neither metapackage included -dev packages
2007-07-30T12:01:00.000Z	crdlb	blazemonger	you'll have to install it manually (apt-get build-dep is your friend)
2007-07-30T12:02:00.000Z	crdlb	blazemonger	it install the build dependencies for a particular package
