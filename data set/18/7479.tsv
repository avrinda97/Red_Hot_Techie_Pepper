2008-01-03T11:44:00.000Z	jhford		anyone know how to get the NVidia proprietary drivers to control fan speed correctly?
2008-01-03T11:45:00.000Z	wibou	jhford	: hummm have you tried nvidia-settings tool?
2008-01-03T11:45:00.000Z	jhford	wibou	yes,  i have tried coolbits and nvclock
2008-01-03T11:46:00.000Z	wibou	jhford	: your GPU is overheating I guess?
2008-01-03T11:46:00.000Z	jhford	wibou	it is at 43 degrees
2008-01-03T11:46:00.000Z	wibou	jhford	: hehe then why do you mean by "control fan correctly" ? It wakes up too often?
2008-01-03T11:46:00.000Z	wibou	jhford	: then **what do you mean... sorry tired.
2008-01-03T11:46:00.000Z	jhford	wibou	it is running at 100%
2008-01-03T11:47:00.000Z	jhford	wibou	it is so loud i can't think
2008-01-03T11:48:00.000Z	wibou	jhford	: yeah I can guess so... well honestly if you tried nvidia tools before I don't know... I would take a look at ACPI stuff, just in case there is not a switch you can turn off/on about it, but it just a really wide guess
2008-01-03T11:50:00.000Z	jhford	wibou	nothing in acpi or /proc/drivers/nvidia to enable it
2008-01-03T11:51:00.000Z	wibou	jhford	: /proc/acpi ? My laptop have some options to control fan... nothing about the GPU fan but maybe.
2008-01-03T11:52:00.000Z	jhford	wibou	yep, i have done that before on my IBM T40, but this isn't an ACPI issue
2008-01-03T11:52:00.000Z	wibou	jhford	: still I know that gentoo nvidia drivers are a bit strange... repatched stuff and so, pluss they might be a bit more recent than those in ubuntu if they are using "beta" stuff
2008-01-03T11:53:00.000Z	jhford	wibou	my card is ONLY supported in 169.07, ubuntu is 100.X
2008-01-03T11:59:00.000Z	wibou	jhford	: nv not working? I know nv sucks, but some people actually use this stuff :P
2008-01-03T11:59:00.000Z	jhford	wibou	nickrud: i need opengl
2008-01-03T12:01:00.000Z	wibou	jhford	: hmmm I think nv can do openGL with mesa stuff, but of course, it's like twice the performance you might have with nvidia proprietary stuff
