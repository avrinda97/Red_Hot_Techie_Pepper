2009-06-03T19:04:00.000Z	JediMaster		hi guys, I've got a 9.04 server running on a remote machine, the load is so high that it's stopping web pages from being served, causing a backlog that is making the load go higher. I have an ssh session open but it's so slow that 10 minutes later the "uptime" command has only just told me that the load is at 86.0
2009-06-03T19:04:00.000Z	SirStan	JediMaster	vps?
2009-06-03T19:04:00.000Z	JediMaster	SirStan	no, full machine
2009-06-03T19:05:00.000Z	SirStan	JediMaster	kill the offending process?
2009-06-03T19:05:00.000Z	SirStan	JediMaster	and install monit
2009-06-03T19:05:00.000Z	SirStan	JediMaster	then reboot the machine
2009-06-03T19:07:00.000Z	JediMaster	SirStan	that's what I figured, I'm trying ssh root@hostname "killall -9 apache2" so that less has to get executed before it starts killing stuff, but looks like it's freezing all the same
2009-06-03T19:07:00.000Z	SirStan	JediMaster	ok?
2009-06-03T19:07:00.000Z	JediMaster	SirStan	would do if the server wasn't 150 miles away
2009-06-03T19:07:00.000Z	JediMaster	SirStan	and no remote KVM
2009-06-03T19:08:00.000Z	SirStan	JediMaster	then I suggest you buy a new dedicated server and jettison the old.
2009-06-03T19:08:00.000Z	JediMaster	SirStan	it's a dual processor dual core xeon
2009-06-03T19:09:00.000Z	SirStan	JediMaster	great time to upgrade an old server..
2009-06-03T19:09:00.000Z	SirStan	JediMaster	if you cant remotely issue a reboot -- what more do you want me to say?
2009-06-03T19:09:00.000Z	SirStan	JediMaster	is this a dell poweredge?
2009-06-03T19:09:00.000Z	JediMaster	SirStan	not actually sure what brand it is
2009-06-03T19:10:00.000Z	SirStan	JediMaster	well if it isnt responsive to any commands.. im not sure what else you think we can suggest.
2009-06-03T19:17:00.000Z	SirStan	JediMaster	traditionally yes
