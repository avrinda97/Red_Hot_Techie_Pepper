2011-03-26T01:37:00.000Z	Polah		jon__, intrader: Do you perhaps have proposed-updates enabled? or backports?
2011-03-26T01:38:00.000Z	Polah		dtchrshr: You need to access your bootloader, i.e. grub
2011-03-26T01:39:00.000Z	dtcrshr	Polah	i got no dual boot, if I turn on the pc it goes straight into ubuntu
2011-03-26T01:41:00.000Z	Polah	dtcrshr	Did you try F8?
2011-03-26T04:06:00.000Z	dtcrshr	Polah	if you get debian stable, the differences are quite interesting
2011-03-26T04:07:00.000Z	Polah	dtcrshr	could you link me or point me in the right direction?
2011-03-26T04:08:00.000Z	dtcrshr	Polah	http://www.debian.org/doc/
2011-03-26T04:08:00.000Z	Polah	dtcrshr	thanks
2011-07-08T00:21:00.000Z	Polah	dtcrshr	You could back up your data elsewhere and redo all the partitions (and reinstall the systems). Y
2011-07-08T00:22:00.000Z	Polah	dtcrshr	or you could take images of your systems, store them elsewhere then redo the partitions and replace the images.
