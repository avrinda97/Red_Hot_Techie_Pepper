2008-04-27T11:54:00.000Z	RITN	ceil420	 you talking to me?
2008-04-27T11:55:00.000Z	ceil420	RITN	yeah sorry
2008-04-27T11:55:00.000Z	RITN	ceil420	np.  is it reccomended that one would upgrade?  or should i just do a full reinstall.
2008-04-27T11:56:00.000Z	ceil420	RITN	many people upgrade with no problem. i'm not one, but that shouldn't stop you from doing it :x
2008-04-27T11:57:00.000Z	ceil420	RITN	probably ubuntu-desktop
2008-04-27T12:02:00.000Z	ceil420	RITN	Ubuntu is designed with ease of use in mind. Gentoo... isn't <_<
2008-04-27T12:03:00.000Z	ceil420	RITN	Ubuntu will update the kernel if there's a dire need (for security purposes). It has a package freeze so you can't update packages for anything other than security between releases. Which has recently annoyed me, because it won't let me update libconfuse so i can install a new wm ;x
2008-04-27T12:04:00.000Z	ceil420	RITN	it doesn't even ask, i think. it just does the update, and you restart whenever you want
2008-04-27T12:05:00.000Z	RITN	ceil420	thats kinda like gentoo with its 'untested' packages.  isnt thier a flag to can set somewhere just to update anyways?
2008-04-27T12:06:00.000Z	ceil420	RITN	if there is, i don't know about it. i wish someone would tell me so i can update libconfuse without worrying about Hardy :x
2008-04-27T12:06:00.000Z	RITN	ceil420	did you post to the forums?
2008-04-27T12:07:00.000Z	ceil420	RITN	i don't visit the forums a lot. such an ugly site <_<
2008-04-27T12:07:00.000Z	ceil420	RITN	yes, they are
2008-12-15T05:10:00.000Z	ceil420	RITN	sounds like a PEBKAC
