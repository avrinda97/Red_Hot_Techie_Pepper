2008-08-05T07:47:00.000Z	xnevermore	lisa_	was it epiphany?
2008-08-05T07:47:00.000Z	lisa_	xnevermore	BINGO!!!!!!!!!!!!! thanks :)
2008-08-05T07:47:00.000Z	xnevermore	lisa_	np
2008-08-05T07:47:00.000Z	lisa_	xnevermore	thank you, i been spending all morning trying to remember that lol :0  hugs to ya
2008-08-05T07:49:00.000Z	lisa_	xnevermore	its really strange,  firefox and opera etc doesnt load my banks login page properly, it flashes on and off.  But epiphany works perfect accesing it.  And I reinstalled ubuntu and I forgiten the name until you reminded me :)
2008-08-05T07:50:00.000Z	xnevermore	lisa_	yeah. epiphany is my backup browser. when firefox starts to piss me off or when i need something quick and want to use less resources, i turn to epiphany
2008-08-05T07:50:00.000Z	lisa_	xnevermore	yeah me too :)
2008-08-05T07:51:00.000Z	lisa_	xnevermore	i rang my bank and told them that firefox and opera makes my login page flash on and off. they are confused why.  But epiphany-browser works perfect, so im lucky I can use that :)
2008-08-05T07:52:00.000Z	xnevermore	lisa_	that's kind of weird, especially since Epiphany uses the same rendering engine as Firefox to display pages
2008-08-05T07:53:00.000Z	lisa_	xnevermore	yeah i know, the tech at my bank cant work out why.  but firefox and opera work great on other pages, its just that one.  but epiphany-browser works great, and it doesnt flash on and off.  no idea :P
2008-08-05T07:54:00.000Z	lisa_	xnevermore	so thank goodness for epiphany-browser :)  otherwise I could not access my banks webpage
2008-08-05T07:56:00.000Z	lisa_	xnevermore	how do I refresh my menu so epiphany-browser shows up in menu?
2008-08-05T07:58:00.000Z	xnevermore	lisa_	it should appear right away. if not, try System->Preferences->Main Menu
2008-08-05T07:59:00.000Z	lisa_	xnevermore	it wasnt ticked in System->Preferences->Main Menu.  I just ticked it
2008-08-05T07:59:00.000Z	lisa_	xnevermore	thanks, after I ticked it in System->Preferences->Main Menu, its now showing :)
