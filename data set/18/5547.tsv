2008-10-01T06:06:00.000Z	Delmarc		Hi... I'm new to Ubuntu... I have downloaded a program in the form of tag.gz and extracted it... how do I make and makeinstall?
2008-10-01T06:07:00.000Z	Delmarc		?
2008-10-01T06:07:00.000Z	dr_willis	Delmarc	 you may want to look VERY hard for a prebuildt package  - compiling from source will take a bit of learning.
2008-10-01T06:07:00.000Z	dr_willis	Delmarc	 install the 'build-essential' package for starters
2008-10-01T06:08:00.000Z	Delmarc	dr_willis	I tried looking in synaptic, it's not there... besides, I want to learn
2008-10-01T06:08:00.000Z	Delmarc	dr_willis	okay
2008-10-01T06:08:00.000Z	dr_willis	Delmarc	 it is in there.. check the spelling.
2008-10-01T06:08:00.000Z	Delmarc	dr_willis	XMMS :op
2008-10-01T06:09:00.000Z	dr_willis	Delmarc	 best thing you can do with xmms. is learn to use an alternaive program
2008-10-01T06:09:00.000Z	Delmarc	dr_willis	which do you recommend personally?
2008-10-01T06:09:00.000Z	dr_willis	Delmarc	 depends on what you are playing. I tend to use bmpx
2008-10-01T06:10:00.000Z	dr_willis	Delmarc	 or songbird
2008-10-01T06:10:00.000Z	Delmarc	dr_willis	I want something minimal... these other programs with extensive "libraries" and needless features turn me off
2008-10-01T06:11:00.000Z	dr_willis	Delmarc	 whats the actual 'needs' however.. :)   you just described what you dident want. (in vague terms) :)
2008-10-01T06:12:00.000Z	Delmarc	dr_willis	heh, yeah, it's often easier :op
2008-10-01T06:12:00.000Z	Delmarc	dr_willis	but thanks for the suggestions
2008-10-01T06:14:00.000Z	Delmarc	dr_willis	why does bmpx have "offline mode"?
2008-10-01T06:15:00.000Z	dr_willis	Delmarc	 no idea.. check its docs.
