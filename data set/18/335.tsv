2012-09-11T18:45:00.000Z	DasEi	makezan	interfaces - file configured for dhcp ?
2012-09-11T18:46:00.000Z	makezan	DasEi	I'm using the install cd.
2012-09-11T18:46:00.000Z	DasEi	makezan	you are currently installing and autoconfig of network doesn't do ?
2012-09-11T18:47:00.000Z	makezan	DasEi	correct autoconfig doesn't work. manual stalls install
2012-09-11T18:47:00.000Z	DasEi	makezan	could be a corrupt installer, did you do both, md5-check on the isofile and the cd's self-test ?
2012-09-11T18:48:00.000Z	makezan	DasEi	hmm never thought of that, but I do have 2 different cds i'm using
2012-09-11T18:50:00.000Z	makezan	DasEi	will change mirror as well, maybe that's why, i'm always using umdcp mirror
2012-09-11T18:50:00.000Z	DasEi	makezan	leat reboot cd and check media for defects
2012-09-11T18:51:00.000Z	DasEi	makezan	torrent the iso down, or easier, pick the iso and check it , most corruptions are bad burns (is why, amongst from saving a disk, I prefer usb-install)
2012-09-11T18:51:00.000Z	makezan	DasEi	youu read my mind. lol just pulled out a usb.
2012-09-11T18:54:00.000Z	DasEi	makezan	make sure iso is fine, use pgarted to format thumbd. to fat, go unetbootin
2012-09-11T18:57:00.000Z	DasEi	makezan	see, there you go, d/l again via torrent (as this auto-checks)re-hash, go usb
2012-09-11T19:23:00.000Z	DasEi	makezan	seldom, maybe an unrecognised NIC ?
2012-09-11T19:23:00.000Z	DasEi	makezan	you us is ready I assume ?
2012-09-11T19:30:00.000Z	makezan	DasEi	? I misunderstood question
