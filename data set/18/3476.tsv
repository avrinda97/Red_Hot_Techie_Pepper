2010-09-21T06:25:00.000Z	manlymatt83		OK, so the alternate CD install failed, but for some reason it had installed enough that I could partially boot.  So I modified /etc/apt/sources.list, am installing ubuntu-desktop, am HOPING that will make it so when I reboot I can access the USB cd creator tool, I'll grab the 10.04 ISO, and install over the USB stick, then re-install. *sigh*
2010-09-21T06:25:00.000Z	manlymatt83		I need a new CDROM - can't wait for it to arrive Thursday
2010-09-21T06:26:00.000Z	ChogyDan	manlymatt83	you can also install ubuntu-desktop^
2010-09-21T06:27:00.000Z	manlymatt83	ChogyDan	I am.  I did "apt-get install ubuntu-desktop"
2010-09-21T06:27:00.000Z	ChogyDan	manlymatt83	^  <------
2010-09-21T06:28:00.000Z	ChogyDan	manlymatt83	it is the task
2010-09-21T06:28:00.000Z	manlymatt83	ChogyDan	ok.  A little confused :)
2010-09-21T07:43:00.000Z	ChogyDan	manlymatt83	what happened to your install?  I missed it
2010-09-21T07:44:00.000Z	manlymatt83	ChogyDan	CDROM is bad, I had no OS on my box, and the live wouldn't boot.  I installed FreeBSD earlier, used that to make a CD of Ubuntu-alternate, booted with that, the install worked for a little while, CDROM died again... but luckily,  I had just enough installed to be able to boot (base OS was on, but no packages).  apt-get install'd ubuntu-desktop, and booted into lucid.
2010-09-21T07:45:00.000Z	ChogyDan	manlymatt83	any error message?
2010-09-21T07:45:00.000Z	manlymatt83	ChogyDan	"Could not install bootloader"
2010-09-21T07:46:00.000Z	ChogyDan	manlymatt83	have you tried installing ubuntu-desktop^     with the ^
2010-09-21T07:47:00.000Z	manlymatt83	ChogyDan	Yes, I did that before when you recommended it - no effect
2010-09-21T07:48:00.000Z	ChogyDan	manlymatt83	have you tried reformating the stick first?  just a guess
2010-09-21T07:51:00.000Z	ChogyDan	manlymatt83	do you have the updates and backports repos enabled?
2010-09-21T07:52:00.000Z	manlymatt83	ChogyDan	I assume so...
2010-09-21T07:53:00.000Z	ChogyDan	manlymatt83	maybe also install ubuntu-standard and ubuntu-minimal
2010-09-21T07:56:00.000Z	ChogyDan	manlymatt83	yw
