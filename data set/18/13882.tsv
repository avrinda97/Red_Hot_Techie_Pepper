2006-03-22T12:12:00.000Z	fr33mind	frank23	how do you do that in home user account?
2006-03-22T12:14:00.000Z	frank23	fr33mind	you download the latest azureus for linux from the website.  put the file somewhere in your home directory   tar xjvf azureus.something.tar.bz2  cd azureus and run ./azureus
2006-03-22T12:15:00.000Z	frank23	fr33mind	you need the latest sun java as well for this
2006-03-22T12:16:00.000Z	fr33mind	frank23	java is ok.
2006-03-22T12:16:00.000Z	fr33mind	frank23	but... it will open files in firefox?
2006-03-22T12:16:00.000Z	frank23	fr33mind	the torrents? I don't know... I always save the .torrent somewhere and then open it with azureus directly
2006-03-22T12:17:00.000Z	frank23	fr33mind	no. maybe you have the wrong sire

2006-03-22T12:21:00.000Z	frank23	fr33mind	a good place to put azureus is  ~/opt  then when you extract it will create ~/opt/azureus
