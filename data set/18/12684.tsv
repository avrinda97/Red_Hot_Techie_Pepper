2006-04-18T06:37:00.000Z	craize		yeah ompaul
2006-04-18T06:37:00.000Z	craize		there was an ati tool to fix this
2006-04-18T06:37:00.000Z	craize		im looking for that :P
2006-04-18T06:38:00.000Z	ompaul	craize	well you won't find an ati tool on a ubuntu site maybe on their own site
2006-04-18T06:39:00.000Z	ompaul	craize	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg --- its on that ati page
2006-04-18T06:39:00.000Z	ompaul	craize	that page sets up ati cards with ease I know :-) I use it on a regular basis
2006-04-18T06:40:00.000Z	ompaul	craize	I dont have one for you any way
2006-04-18T06:41:00.000Z	ompaul	craize	search wiki.ubuntu.com is about all I can think of
2006-04-18T06:45:00.000Z	ompaul	craize	message the bot please - stop spamming the channel if anyone else had a suggestion for you they would pop it out here
2006-04-18T06:49:00.000Z	craize	ompaul	i followed the ati link, however i still cant change my refresh rate, or my resolution
2006-04-18T06:50:00.000Z	ompaul	craize	in the dpkg-reconfigure choose the right module - it is usually the issue
2006-04-18T07:03:00.000Z	ompaul	craize	^^^^^
