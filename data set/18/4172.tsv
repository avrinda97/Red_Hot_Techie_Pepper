2009-12-17T01:04:00.000Z	jmyers		Anyone able to recommend some alternatives to Wine?  I'm trying to run a training video program that uses Flash (ComptTIA A+ certification exam prep stuff), and it's not working under Wine.  It's possible that it has something to do with the AMD 64 architecture. :/
2009-12-17T01:04:00.000Z	DopeGhoti	jmyers	KVM or virtualbox?
2009-12-17T01:07:00.000Z	DopeGhoti	jmyers	welcome to #ubuntu ;)
2009-12-17T01:07:00.000Z	jmyers	DopeGhoti	I'm not sure how to answer your question.  I'm not running a virtual box, but I don't know what KVM is.
2009-12-17T01:07:00.000Z	jmyers	DopeGhoti	wouldn't have been so bad except I lagged and 3 pages of text flooded by
2009-12-17T01:07:00.000Z	DopeGhoti	jmyers	KVM and Virtualbox are options for running an actual Windows installation on a virtial CP
2009-12-17T01:07:00.000Z	DopeGhoti	jmyers	er, PC
2009-12-17T01:08:00.000Z	jmyers	DopeGhoti	ah, I have grub multibooting to WinXP, I just don't wanna load the garbage. :(
2009-12-17T01:08:00.000Z	jmyers	DopeGhoti	actually, I take that back.  I wiped WinXP last night when I formatted the drive to ext3. :)
2009-12-17T01:09:00.000Z	DopeGhoti	jmyers	Advantage of virtualization: not having to reboot the _real_ operating system :)
2009-12-17T01:09:00.000Z	jmyers	DopeGhoti	Windows can suck a bag of .. well, I'll refrain from finishing that statement cuz there are kids here.
2009-12-17T01:09:00.000Z	jmyers	DopeGhoti	I had ubuntu in a virtual box on windows for the longest, I just decided to bite the bullet and learn the real OS anyways.  Sick of windows flakey unstable garbage anyway.
2009-12-17T01:10:00.000Z	DopeGhoti	jmyers	And thus, you were Enlightened ;)
2009-12-17T01:11:00.000Z	jmyers	DopeGhoti	problem is, I may have made the leap too soon.  Struggling to get all my hardware running just so-so.  Expecially on this AMD 64 architecture.  Seems like howto's and packages are doubly hard to find and install for this architecture. :(
2009-12-17T01:12:00.000Z	jmyers	DopeGhoti	I've been trying to get my ATI Radeon HD 4850 to work right for 3 days. :/
2009-12-17T01:13:00.000Z	DopeGhoti	jmyers	mm, ATI/AMD video card support has been somewhat lacking :/
2009-12-17T01:14:00.000Z	jmyers	DopeGhoti	it's crazy.  When I run sh on the driver, and use the --buildandinstallpkg Ubuntu/karmic switch on it, it SORTA works.
2009-12-17T01:15:00.000Z	jmyers	DopeGhoti	BUT, I gotta run it in the 2.6.31-14 grub option, and not the 2.6.31-16 option, and it accelleration is SOOOOO SLOW.  Windows chop and stuff when I try and move them.  The only advantage is I can set the resolution, and it doesn't run off the edges of my hdtv like it does with the standard video drivers
