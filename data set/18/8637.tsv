2007-08-02T14:45:00.000Z	riaal		okey, when you install ubuntu the default user and the root have the same password?
2007-08-02T14:45:00.000Z	univremonster	riaal	 you are correct
2007-08-02T14:46:00.000Z	riaal	univremonster	stefg is that a security risk? chall I change it?
2007-08-02T14:47:00.000Z	univremonster	riaal	 I don't think it's much of a security risk, you're only 'root' in the traditional sense when you use sudo
2007-08-02T14:48:00.000Z	riaal	univremonster	so you for example have the same password for the user you are loged in to now as the sudoroot?
2007-08-02T14:49:00.000Z	univremonster	riaal	 normally, you are just a user.  When you want to do anything as root you use Synaptec or the terminal using sudo.  There is really no way to "log in" as root and stay that way.  There are ways, but none of them are particularly recommended by any Ubuntu staff
2007-08-02T14:50:00.000Z	riaal	univremonster	okey, It feel stupid to login whit the same password that is used for managing the system, thats all
2007-08-02T14:53:00.000Z	univremonster	riaal	 here's a solution.  In terminal, type sudo passwd root
2007-08-02T14:54:00.000Z	riaal	univremonster	that changes the root password?
2007-08-02T14:54:00.000Z	univremonster	riaal	yep
2007-08-02T14:54:00.000Z	riaal	univremonster	that just can't be a bad ide? To have different passwords for the normal user and the "root"?
2007-08-02T14:55:00.000Z	univremonster	riaal	 It's kind of contrary to the basic setup of Ubuntu.  It's more of a security risk to be able to login as root than to do sudo and have the privledges for 5 min
2007-08-02T14:56:00.000Z	riaal	univremonster	thats true but different passwords for the "sudo command" and the normal login, must be a good ide?
2007-08-02T14:57:00.000Z	univremonster	riaal	 you may want to refer to http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=515601&highlight=root+password, the comment made by Seisen
2007-08-02T14:59:00.000Z	univremonster	riaal	 Have you considered setting up a second login with no password for users?
2007-08-02T14:59:00.000Z	riaal	univremonster	ofc. I have a good clue what Im doing, as Im use to linux (redhat) whit root acount Im a bit confued =)
2007-08-02T15:00:00.000Z	univremonster	riaal	 I didn't mean to offend.  But if you created the second account your guest would not be able to run any sudo commands.
2007-08-02T15:01:00.000Z	riaal	univremonster	none taken =) that is true, doing it now
