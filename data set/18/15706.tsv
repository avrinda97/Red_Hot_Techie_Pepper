2005-03-04T15:05:00.000Z	delltony		ok i got it just needed python now for the final question of the night is this correct if i want to add ~/bin to path  i put export PATH:$PATH=~/bin;  in bach_profile ?
2005-03-04T15:06:00.000Z	GammaRay	delltony	replace ~ with $HOME
2005-03-04T15:07:00.000Z	GammaRay	delltony	~ does not work if it has a char before it
2005-03-04T15:07:00.000Z	GammaRay	delltony	oh and it should look like this: export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin
2005-03-04T15:09:00.000Z	GammaRay	delltony	.bash_profile should do it
2005-03-04T15:11:00.000Z	GammaRay	delltony	what does?
2005-03-04T15:12:00.000Z	GammaRay	delltony	and alias would work also
2005-03-04T15:12:00.000Z	GammaRay	delltony	alias btdown=btdownloadgui.py
2005-03-04T15:12:00.000Z	GammaRay	delltony	you need to relogin or source ~/.bash_profile
2005-03-04T15:15:00.000Z	GammaRay	delltony	.bash_profile is only loaded when you login.. .bashrc is loaded for every terminal

2005-03-04T15:38:00.000Z	delltony	GammaRay	thanks i found a work around before looking at that let me see your method
2005-03-04T15:39:00.000Z	GammaRay	delltony	how hard is it to edit? have you found a version in $HOME?
2005-03-04T15:40:00.000Z	GammaRay	delltony	file fortmat: http://standards.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/ar01s02.html
2005-03-04T15:41:00.000Z	GammaRay	delltony	menu format: http://standards.freedesktop.org/menu-spec/latest/
2005-03-04T15:51:00.000Z	delltony	GammaRay	thanks for the info but after reading it i'm still confused i kinda understand how to add a directory to the menu but to actually add a file within that dir i'm confused
2005-03-16T08:35:00.000Z	GammaRay	delltony	a little redundant
2005-03-16T08:36:00.000Z	GammaRay	delltony	umask covers fmask
