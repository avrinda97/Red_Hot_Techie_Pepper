2010-05-05T22:13:00.000Z	AbuMaia	simar	what is your question?
2010-05-05T22:14:00.000Z	simar	AbuMaia	i want to run a executable file at startup every time in my home/crclient folder
2010-05-05T22:14:00.000Z	simar	AbuMaia	 please help me out
2010-05-05T22:14:00.000Z	AbuMaia	simar	adding it to Startup Applications didn't work?
2010-05-05T22:15:00.000Z	simar	AbuMaia	Actually it is a terminal based application and it recieves parameters ..
2010-05-05T22:16:00.000Z	AbuMaia	simar	you can add parameters in Startup Applications too
2010-05-05T22:16:00.000Z	simar	AbuMaia	 fine
2010-05-05T22:19:00.000Z	simar	AbuMaia	another question actually the executable file is in home/crclient folder named crclient .. why i have to always enter the crclient folder by cd the call by using ./crclient . I mean what does this ./ mean and isn't there a way to run it right from the home folder ie without using the cd command .. like ./crclient/crclient -u   fails .... please help
2010-05-05T22:20:00.000Z	AbuMaia	simar	I don't know if it will work how you want, but you could try to make a link in your home folder to the crclient.  I think it's the "ln" command
2010-05-05T22:25:00.000Z	AbuMaia	simar	 same way, just give the path to the file:   ~/crclient/crclient
2010-05-05T22:25:00.000Z	AbuMaia	simar	 or the long way:  /home/simar/crclient/crclient
2010-05-05T22:26:00.000Z	AbuMaia	simar	or whatever your computer account name is
2010-05-05T22:29:00.000Z	AbuMaia	simar	 ln -s /home/username/crclient/crclient /usr/bin/crclient   (I think)
2010-05-05T22:31:00.000Z	AbuMaia	simar	just change "username" ^_^
2010-05-05T22:35:00.000Z	simar	AbuMaia	CogitoErgoSam Its the problem that want to make a link .Actually i am wondering that why we can't run executables by just the names . Even by entering in the crclient directory by cd crclient and then typing crclient to run the executable crclient displays simar@simar-laptop:~/crclient$ crclient
2010-05-05T22:37:00.000Z	AbuMaia	simar	making the link *should* let you run the ap the way you describe
2010-05-05T22:40:00.000Z	simar	AbuMaia	CogitoErgoSam Well thanks friends So it means that when ever we have to run binaries in ubuntu we have to enter that particular directory and then use ./ binaryname ...  thats the only way right (if it is not a usr/bin binary)     and also it cannot be called directly from the parent directory by using something like ./crclient/crclient  sort ..
