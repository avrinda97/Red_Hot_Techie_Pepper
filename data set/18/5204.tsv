2008-11-30T05:47:00.000Z	mrwes		Is there anyway to save login information when using openssh-server, or do I have to type the server name in everytime I connect?
2008-11-30T05:48:00.000Z	Yahovah	mrwes	Look up ssh keys. Specifically ssh-keygen
2008-11-30T05:48:00.000Z	mrwes	Yahovah	uh?
2008-11-30T05:58:00.000Z	Yahovah	mrwes	Yes. Set up a static assignment with your DHCPd.
2008-11-30T05:58:00.000Z	mrwes	Yahovah	Ok...that's what I thought...thanks
2008-11-30T05:59:00.000Z	Yahovah	mrwes	Is this a WAN or LAN address?
2008-11-30T06:01:00.000Z	mrwes	Yahovah	LAN...from a router
2008-11-30T06:01:00.000Z	mrwes	Yahovah	how do I do that in 8.10?
2008-11-30T06:01:00.000Z	Yahovah	mrwes	Okay, no-ip/dyndns won't work then. They both block IANA private space.
2008-11-30T06:02:00.000Z	mrwes	Yahovah	I have static on my desktop running 8.04, but not on my laptop running 8.10
2008-11-30T06:02:00.000Z	Yahovah	mrwes	Static leases are controlled by the DHCPd. You'll want to configure it there. Alternatively, you can change your Ubuntu box to a static IP with system -> administration -> network in GNOME.
2008-11-30T06:02:00.000Z	mrwes	Yahovah	ok
2008-11-30T06:03:00.000Z	Yahovah	mrwes	I would change it on the DHCPd (router) if possible, though. It's seamless.
2008-11-30T06:03:00.000Z	mrwes	Yahovah	 Oh...I've never done that on a router
2008-11-30T06:04:00.000Z	Yahovah	mrwes	It just makes the router give certain IPs to certain mac addresses. Static DHCP leases.
2008-11-30T06:05:00.000Z	mrwes	Yahovah	hrmm
2008-11-30T06:06:00.000Z	mrwes	Yahovah	Ok...I'm in the router...running Tomato firmware BTW
2008-11-30T06:14:00.000Z	mrwes	Yahovah	Ok..I found it on the router..under device list and I just clicked assign static iP...pretty easy
