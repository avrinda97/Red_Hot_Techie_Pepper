2010-07-25T06:24:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499		I've lost all sound on my ubuntu 10.04 64 bit system how do I fix this
2010-07-25T06:25:00.000Z	pfifo	ShapeShifter499	hi, run alsamixer form the command line and check that everything is unmuted
2010-07-25T06:26:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499	pfifo	it says "cannot open mixer: No such file or directory"
2010-07-25T06:26:00.000Z	pfifo	ShapeShifter499	was sound woring after you installed?
2010-07-25T06:26:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499	pfifo	did it somehow get deleted?
2010-07-25T06:27:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499	pfifo	sound on my system was working up till today
2010-07-25T06:28:00.000Z	pfifo	ShapeShifter499	if I was in your position I would just reinstall, in my experience trouble shooting sound problems is a big hassle.
2010-07-25T06:28:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499	pfifo	reinstall? the WHOLE system?
2010-07-25T06:29:00.000Z	pfifo	ShapeShifter499	its probbally quicker than trying to track down the issue and then attempting to fix it.
2010-07-25T06:43:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499	pfifo	ok I installed somethings....and rebooted and sound now is working
2011-04-17T01:35:00.000Z	pfifo	ShapeShifter499	distcc is for compiling like that
2011-04-17T01:44:00.000Z	pfifo	ShapeShifter499	to use a cluster setup for a webserver you would probbally want to go with proxies instead, something like squid
2011-04-17T01:47:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499	pfifo	this? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squid_(software)
2011-04-17T01:48:00.000Z	pfifo	ShapeShifter499	yeah thats it.
2011-04-17T01:53:00.000Z	pfifo	ShapeShifter499	you build a cluster server to take care of a certina task, just 1 single task, like calculating pi to the billionth digit. It dosent work for everyday computer use.
2011-04-17T01:54:00.000Z	ShapeShifter499	pfifo	ah
2011-04-17T01:56:00.000Z	pfifo	ShapeShifter499	yes distcc is a good example, mutiple computer all trying to accomlish a single task, compiling source code into a program
