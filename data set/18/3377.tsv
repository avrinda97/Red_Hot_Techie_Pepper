2009-10-19T03:09:00.000Z	flansuse		I've looked everywhere, and it seems that it's not possible to do a "true" 2-way sync with rsync. (Multiple home folders all sync'd through a single server shared folder.) However, there is a program called Unison that will do this for me. Only problem is, it's super slow when you have many files, since it seems to check EVERY file EVERY time, even though nothing changed! Does anyone know how to tweak Unison?
2009-10-19T03:11:00.000Z	vlt	flansuse	unison has to check every file to see whether it has changed ;-)  It's not very slow here. How much data are we talking about?
2009-10-19T03:11:00.000Z	flansuse	vlt	about 800 MB.
2009-10-19T03:12:00.000Z	flansuse	vlt	when I start Unison, it begins scanning and takes forever, and even freezes up, until it's finished scanning. (This is before it allows me to click "start" to sync the folders.)
2009-10-19T03:12:00.000Z	vlt	flansuse	I'm keeping 200 GB synced on four servers with unison which worls fine.
2009-10-19T03:12:00.000Z	flansuse	vlt	however, rsync just flies through, without a problem. (I just can't use rsync, since I want to have a "roaming" home folder, via a server share.)
2009-10-19T03:12:00.000Z	flansuse	vlt	what version of Unison?
2009-10-19T03:13:00.000Z	flansuse	vlt	I think "unison -version" will tell you.
2009-10-19T03:15:00.000Z	vlt	flansuse	Thanks. 2.13.61
2009-10-19T03:15:00.000Z	vlt		2.13.16
2009-10-19T03:15:00.000Z	flansuse	vlt	really? I'm not 2.27.57
2009-10-19T03:15:00.000Z	flansuse		*I'm on
2009-10-19T03:15:00.000Z	flansuse	vlt	how long does it take for it to scan 200 GB for you?
2009-10-19T03:16:00.000Z	vlt	flansuse	I'll check ... brb
2009-10-19T03:16:00.000Z	flansuse	vlt	okay, thank you.
2009-10-19T03:28:00.000Z	vlt	flansuse	Ok, checked 58GB (no changes) in 11 minutes.
2009-10-19T03:28:00.000Z	flansuse		Hm, then I guess mine isn't much slower.
2009-10-19T03:29:00.000Z	vlt	flansuse	Yes, depends on what "slow" means for you ;-)
