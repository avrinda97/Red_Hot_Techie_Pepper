2006-11-20T08:12:00.000Z	Aji-Dahaka		so, is there a supported way to migrate from amd64 to i386?
2006-11-20T08:13:00.000Z	mcphail	Aji-Dahaka	no
2006-11-20T08:25:00.000Z	mcphail	Aji-Dahaka	external drives are cheap these days
2006-11-20T08:25:00.000Z	Aji-Dahaka	mcphail	but is it that hard of an operation to do an in-place upgrade?
2006-11-20T08:27:00.000Z	mcphail	Aji-Dahaka	the 64 bit OS is different on every level. There is no supported way to change to the 32 bit OS
2006-11-20T08:28:00.000Z	mcphail	Aji-Dahaka	and, to be honest, if you are going to try such a thing without backing up your data first you are going to regret it
2006-11-20T08:30:00.000Z	Aji-Dahaka	mcphail	I still don't see why it should be a difficult or (even more importantly) dangerous operation.  should simply remove all of the packages installed and install all new versions
2006-11-20T08:32:00.000Z	mcphail	Aji-Dahaka	well, for a start dpkg/apt have the architecture "hard wired" at compile time and will always try to use the 64bit packages. If you get over that one, it is only the first of your worries
2006-11-20T08:35:00.000Z	mcphail	Aji-Dahaka	maybe, but I doubt it :) Version numbering would be the same between the two architectures, so unlikely to update. You'd end up with a mess of 32 and 64 bit apps, each eaxpecting different word sizes etc
2006-11-20T08:35:00.000Z	Aji-Dahaka	mcphail	there's a flag to force reinstalling of all packages, right?
2006-11-20T08:35:00.000Z	mcphail	Aji-Dahaka	no idea
2006-11-20T08:36:00.000Z	mcphail	Aji-Dahaka	your data cannot be very valuable to you
2006-11-20T08:38:00.000Z	mcphail	Aji-Dahaka	for a start, you are changing kernel architecture via an unsupported route. Can you say that your filesystem drivers will remain consistent throughout that process?
2006-11-20T08:39:00.000Z	mcphail	Aji-Dahaka	you make rather brave assumptions :)
2006-11-20T08:41:00.000Z	Aji-Dahaka	mcphail	does it help that I'm a kernel dev by day and that my questions regarding this operation are solely inquiries into how ubuntu's package system will accomodate this safe and possible operation?
2006-11-20T08:41:00.000Z	mcphail	Aji-Dahaka	it doesn't help at all. If you were a kernel dev _and_ a dpkg guru then it might...
2006-11-20T08:42:00.000Z	mcphail	Aji-Dahaka	:)
2006-11-20T08:42:00.000Z	mcphail	Aji-Dahaka	if you can manage to do this safely, a howto would be nice...
