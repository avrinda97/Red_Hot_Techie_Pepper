2006-07-20T09:31:00.000Z	RichG	prophet	I just *glanced* at the user documentation for the first time ever, and it has a clear explanation of the UNIX/Linux file system scheme
2006-07-20T09:32:00.000Z	RichG	prophet	unless you want to use textual applications, you shouldn't need to browse through bin folders. that's what the GNOME menu/K menu is for :S
2006-07-20T09:34:00.000Z	RichG	prophet	there are lots of good introductions to UNIX/Linux on the web. if you just try and dive into Linux when you've only previously used Windows, you probably won't discover much yourself. it's actually all quite simple. :)
2006-07-20T09:37:00.000Z	RichG	prophet	in a nutshell: the system (kernel) starts, and executes a shell, usually a shell called bash. what's a shell? well it's the most basic level of interaction between the kernel and the user. the main shell for Windows is Explorer, which consists of a task bar, desktop and file browser. though, unlike Explorer, bash is a textual application
2006-07-20T09:39:00.000Z	RichG	prophet	anyway, the shell has bank of variables, each with a textual value. one important variable is PATH, the value of which is a list of paths (like /bin, /usr/bin) ***which are searched when you type in something like "firefox"***. bash looks for a file named "firefox" inside the directories in this list, and when it finds a match, it executes the file
2006-07-20T09:43:00.000Z	RichG	prophet	you don't see this happening because Ubuntu automatically tells bash to start GNOME, which hides the terminals where textual applications get input and put output. however, the process is essentially the same for when you launch an application in a graphical desktop environment.
2006-07-20T09:51:00.000Z	RichG	prophet	there isn't one set by default. check the Keyboard Shortcuts preferences
2006-07-20T09:54:00.000Z	RichG	prophet	most of them are probably plug-ins
