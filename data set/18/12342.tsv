2006-10-03T16:39:00.000Z	blind		My VNC server won't work. I try to connect to it, it says unable to connect. I try to run Xvnc, it says it's running on display 0 -- so why won't it connect?

2006-11-18T11:32:00.000Z	kitche	blind	it's on the official site there might be a 3rd party repo that has them
2007-05-18T16:04:00.000Z	kitche	blind	what gnome res picker does not even look at xorg.conf res just remove all the res from /etc/X11/xorg.conf and just put int he resolution you want to use
2007-05-18T16:05:00.000Z	blind	kitche	is there another program i could use, or perhaps a cli program built in that i could use?
2007-05-18T16:06:00.000Z	kitche	blind	you can do sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg and reconfigure xorg and just make sure your resolution is there for the resolution that xorg can use at least that's how some advance users just do it
2007-05-18T16:06:00.000Z	blind	kitche	i edited my xorg manually. i just tried to use xrandr and it says the mode is not available.
2007-05-18T16:11:00.000Z	blind	kitche	i just used dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg, and removed all but 1280x1024 resolutions, and inputted the correct refresh rates, and it's still at 1024x768 :\
