2005-10-30T15:17:00.000Z	kevix	arbir	well you have either vim or emacs. each has its own religion!
2005-10-30T15:18:00.000Z	kevix	arbir	but ALL unix like systems have 'vi', so its always good to know.
2005-10-30T15:20:00.000Z	kevix	arbir	I've always used vim. never had the patience to learn emacs.
2005-10-30T15:21:00.000Z	kevix	arbir	when you say text editor--is that for editing any file or for creating reports--if so, use latex!
2005-10-30T15:22:00.000Z	arbir	kevix	i agree
2005-10-30T15:24:00.000Z	kevix	arbir	it takes a while, but no WP compares!
