2011-08-18T01:08:00.000Z	escott	altice	that is a usb device id. google for it
2011-08-18T01:09:00.000Z	altice	escott	how do I search for that, google returned zero results with what I put in
2011-08-18T01:11:00.000Z	escott	altice	0612 is not any usb manufacturer i can find. so maybe its something else, but it is usb format. can you !paste the output of whatever command gave you that
2011-08-18T01:13:00.000Z	altice	escott	 from "sudo lspci" Ethernet controller: Device 0612:8290
2011-08-18T01:13:00.000Z	escott	altice	thats all it says?
2011-08-18T01:13:00.000Z	escott	altice	lspci -v
2011-08-18T01:15:00.000Z	altice	escott	I appreciate your help, but that is a lot to type. Keep in mind I'm having network problems and I cannot paste the output of that cmd, I would have to retype it all
2011-08-18T01:16:00.000Z	escott	altice	the control and status stuff arent as important
2011-08-18T01:16:00.000Z	escott	altice	just need something to identify it by
2011-08-18T01:16:00.000Z	altice	escott	that's what I'm telling you, the only identification it provide is that device ID number, there's nothing else there
2011-08-18T01:17:00.000Z	altice	escott	idk what else you'd be looking for, there are no names
2011-08-18T01:17:00.000Z	escott	altice	what manufacturer is this machine from
2011-08-18T01:19:00.000Z	escott	altice	and this is a pcmcia card?
2011-08-18T01:19:00.000Z	altice	escott	this is onboard ethernet
2011-08-18T01:21:00.000Z	escott	altice	thats really weird. i wonder how it even knows that its an ethernet controller
2011-08-18T01:23:00.000Z	altice	escott	I know, I have no idea how it can figure that out and not the rest. sad things are happening here
2011-08-18T01:24:00.000Z	escott	altice	can you boot windows and try to identify it that way?
2011-08-18T01:24:00.000Z	altice	escott	too late, wiped the HDD
