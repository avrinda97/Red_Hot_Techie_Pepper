2006-03-08T15:48:00.000Z	Plouj		yo, seriously, have any of you here re-compiled your ubuntu kernels?
2006-03-08T15:48:00.000Z	Plouj		then don't answer!
2006-03-08T15:49:00.000Z	Plouj		I would like to know how to deal with having a custom kernel installed and installing nvidia drivers
2006-03-08T15:49:00.000Z	Plouj		since the nvidia-* packages require the normal ubuntu kernel
2006-03-08T15:50:00.000Z	Plouj		I would like to let synaptics manage my nvidia packages
2006-03-08T15:50:00.000Z	Plouj		I'm not familiar with ubuntu filesystem yet
2006-03-08T15:51:00.000Z	Plouj		well, thats crap
2006-03-08T15:51:00.000Z	Plouj		the only reason I have to run a custom kernel is cuz ubuntu refues to boot on my system otherwise
2006-03-08T15:51:00.000Z	Plouj		thats annnoying
2006-03-08T15:51:00.000Z	Plouj		I don't have time to learn all that
2006-03-08T15:53:00.000Z	trappist	Plouj	nvidia modules (and all kernel modules) are very kernel-specific.  if you use a custom kernel you go to nvidia.com and run their installer.  it's actually not that hard.
2006-03-08T15:54:00.000Z	Plouj	trappist	ok, but I would prefer to figure out how to make the stock ubuntu boot on my system
2006-03-08T15:54:00.000Z	trappist	Plouj	what happens when you try?  what do you change in the config to make it work?
2006-03-08T15:55:00.000Z	Plouj	trappist	this is what happens: http://plouj.no-ip.com/kubuntu3.jpg, to make it work I just copied my gentoo config, and there are a lot of things changed, I haven't nailed it down yet
2006-03-08T15:56:00.000Z	trappist	Plouj	breezy or dapper?  scsi or sata boot device?
2006-03-08T15:56:00.000Z	Plouj	trappist	breezy, sata boot device, on nforce4
2006-03-08T15:57:00.000Z	trappist	Plouj	I wonder if it works on dapper.  have you filed a bug report or searched launchpad for the bug?
2006-03-08T16:07:00.000Z	trappist	Plouj	it's explained well in the man page
