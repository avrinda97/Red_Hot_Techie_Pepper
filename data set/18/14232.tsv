2005-11-03T15:44:00.000Z	grigora		hi, I cannot hear anything through my speakers, even simple stuff that used to make noise before (clicking icons, etc) has stopped working, does anyone know if there is a setting to bring my sound back? thanks
2005-11-03T15:46:00.000Z	brownie17	grigora	have you tried rebooting? or like "esd"?
2005-11-03T15:46:00.000Z	brownie17	grigora	did you pkill esd?
2005-11-03T15:56:00.000Z	grigora	brownie17	what exactly do you want me to try doing? I have not rebooted the machine.
2005-11-03T15:59:00.000Z	grigora	brownie17	I tried restarting alsa by /etc/init.d/alsa-utils restart, but that didn't help much
2005-11-03T16:00:00.000Z	brownie17	grigora	try "esd"
2005-11-03T16:01:00.000Z	brownie17	grigora	i know you use ALSA, but some applications still use esd, and i think gnome is one of them?, so try it.
2005-11-03T16:01:00.000Z	grigora	brownie17	there is no esd under /etc/init.d/ and I just tried pkill esd. didn't do much good
2005-11-03T16:01:00.000Z	brownie17	grigora	no try just "esd" just type "esd" at a terminal
2005-11-03T16:02:00.000Z	brownie17	grigora	the init.d is for booting i think. and maybe you shouldn't mess with it if you don't know what you are doing
2005-11-03T16:02:00.000Z	grigora	brownie17	thanks for the heads up, but I do know what I am doing as far as init.d goes :)
2005-11-03T16:03:00.000Z	brownie17	grigora	then my apologies, sorry i can't help
2005-11-03T16:03:00.000Z	grigora	brownie17	typing in esd just sits in my terminal ... doesn't do much
2005-11-03T16:04:00.000Z	brownie17	grigora	did you set up ALSA properly, or just select it in the multimedia systems selector?
2005-11-03T16:05:00.000Z	grigora	brownie17	honestly, I didn't specifically set up anything, but as of several hours ago I could here all the sounds (booting, clicking icons, etc) so I know the setup is correct, I just think something got "switched off" and I can't hear anything now
2005-11-03T16:06:00.000Z	brownie17	grigora	did you change any sound settings? maybe all you need is a reboot. it doesn't take that long and if it solves the problem, then it saves alot of time, if not, nop harm done
2005-11-03T16:08:00.000Z	grigora	brownie17	I might just have to do that
2005-11-03T16:10:00.000Z	grigora	brownie17	intelikey: thanks for your help!
