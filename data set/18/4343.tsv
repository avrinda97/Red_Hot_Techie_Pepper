2009-05-11T02:01:00.000Z	quizme		can somebody help me install keepassx, https://launchpad.net/~keepassx/+archive/ppa
2009-05-11T02:01:00.000Z	quizme		i don't know how to install this ppa thing, and the gpg and asc files
2009-05-11T02:02:00.000Z	quizme		i'm confused
2009-05-11T02:03:00.000Z	VCoolio	quizme	it's explained here https://help.launchpad.net/Packaging/PPA#keys?action=show&redirect=PPAKeys
2009-05-11T02:05:00.000Z	VCoolio	quizme	not that complicated but Iets see. No, no login needed
2009-05-11T02:06:00.000Z	VCoolio	quizme	first add the repository lines. Open synaptic, go to settings > repositories
2009-05-11T02:08:00.000Z	VCoolio	quizme	then from https://launchpad.net/~keepassx/+archive/ppa click the key 1024R etcetera
2009-05-11T02:08:00.000Z	VCoolio	quizme	you copied to textfile and imported it?
2009-05-11T02:09:00.000Z	VCoolio	quizme	ok, then reload database and find your package and install, if no errors / warnings about keys it's ok
2009-05-11T02:09:00.000Z	VCoolio	quizme	in synaptic main window click reload or in terminal sudo apt-get update
2009-05-11T02:11:00.000Z	VCoolio	quizme	ok post here or use pastebin if it's long and multiline text
2009-05-11T02:13:00.000Z	VCoolio	quizme	you pasted this as key in text editor and imported? http://paste.ubuntu.com/169114/
2009-05-11T02:16:00.000Z	VCoolio	quizme	but something like that?
2009-05-11T02:18:00.000Z	VCoolio	quizme	no, I don't know, it's what I got when I clicked the key for your package. You use jaunty? It may be different each time, don't know. At least if you trust the package install it, the warning is just a warning, not an error
2009-05-11T02:21:00.000Z	VCoolio	quizme	yes, with sudo, but check ubuntuforums there is a script that fixes your repo keys problem, I'll go look for it
2009-05-11T02:24:00.000Z	VCoolio	quizme	the warnings were for other repositories than keepassx; to fix use the first post of this thread http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1056099&highlight=ppa+keys but even better is do it yourself and understand what needs to be done
2009-05-11T02:25:00.000Z	VCoolio	quizme	ok, bookmark the link I gave and sleep well
2010-03-14T04:57:00.000Z	VCoolio	quizme	machine; but if you want to change it use 'about me' in the menus
