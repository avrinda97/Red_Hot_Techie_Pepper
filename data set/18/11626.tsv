2006-07-03T16:25:00.000Z	digital_	Subhuman	Thanks for the info :-)
2006-07-03T16:25:00.000Z	Subhuman	digital_	what are you trying to do?
2006-07-03T16:26:00.000Z	Subhuman	digital_	if you want to compile you need the package "build-essential"
2006-07-03T16:26:00.000Z	Subhuman	digital_	in what app?
2006-07-03T16:27:00.000Z	Subhuman	digital_	have you tried k3b?
2006-07-03T16:27:00.000Z	Subhuman	digital_	open the terminal and type "sudo apt-get install dvd+rw-tools"
2006-07-03T16:28:00.000Z	digital_	Subhuman	I have that. It's version 5 something
2006-07-03T16:29:00.000Z	Subhuman	digital_	ahh so you want to compile the newest version, have you ever compiled before? if not "sudo apt-get install build-essential" and then tell me if you get stuck, the tar'd file to download should ghave a text file called "INSTALL" which will explain how to compile.
2006-07-03T16:30:00.000Z	digital_	Subhuman	I've compiled before. I don't want to though. I would like a binary so I can upgrade it when a new Ubuntu package comes out.
2006-07-03T16:30:00.000Z	Subhuman	digital_	use checkinstall
2006-07-03T16:31:00.000Z	digital_	Subhuman	What's that do?
2006-07-03T16:31:00.000Z	Subhuman	digital_	ubotu ^
2006-07-03T16:35:00.000Z	Subhuman	digital_	do it like !checkinstall
2006-07-03T16:36:00.000Z	digital_	Subhuman	Thans for thin info. Looks like I have a lot of work to do.
2006-07-03T16:37:00.000Z	Subhuman	digital_	just "./configure && make && sudo checkinstall " if everything goes to plan.
2006-07-03T16:38:00.000Z	digital_	Subhuman	Nice! I'll give that a go. I got the dvd+rw-tools from Edgy
2006-07-03T16:38:00.000Z	digital_	Subhuman	I'm still waiting for the dev tools to be installed
