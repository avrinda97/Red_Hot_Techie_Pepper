2008-10-30T10:35:00.000Z	dannybuntu	thoreauputic	so i have to isntall openssh-server to enable ssh access to my pc
2008-10-30T10:36:00.000Z	thoreauputic	dannybuntu	yes, it's not magic :) You need the server
2008-10-30T10:36:00.000Z	thoreauputic	dannybuntu	but only if you need remote access to your box from elsewhere via ssh
2008-10-30T10:36:00.000Z	dannybuntu	thoreauputic	thanks ssh looks cool :) somebody asked me ssh in their computer

2008-10-30T10:37:00.000Z	thoreauputic	dannybuntu	you don't need openssh-server unless you need other IP addresses to access your box
2008-10-30T10:38:00.000Z	thoreauputic	dannybuntu	the client is for outgoing connections and is installed by default
2008-10-30T10:38:00.000Z	dannybuntu	thoreauputic	i see - so if i leave my pc on and know the ip address - i can ssh to it from another location
2008-10-30T10:39:00.000Z	thoreauputic	dannybuntu	yes
2008-10-30T10:39:00.000Z	dannybuntu	thoreauputic	thats very very interesting :)
2008-10-30T10:39:00.000Z	dannybuntu	thoreauputic	im gonna try it ^_^
2008-10-30T10:39:00.000Z	thoreauputic	dannybuntu	you might want to use iptables or a front end firewall thing to restrict access to certain IP addresses though
