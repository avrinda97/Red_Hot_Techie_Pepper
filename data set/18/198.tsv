2012-06-15T23:32:00.000Z	Chuck_Norris		so, did you try 259.59?
2012-06-15T23:32:00.000Z	Chuck_Norris		i had problems only with 295.40
2012-06-15T23:34:00.000Z	Chuck_Norris		ye, but its beta
2012-06-15T23:35:00.000Z	Chuck_Norris		yes
2012-06-15T23:36:00.000Z	Chuck_Norris		my gt 520, pablo99 which PPA?
2012-06-15T23:37:00.000Z	gigix	Chuck_Norris	how many ppas have you tried so far ?
2012-06-15T23:37:00.000Z	Chuck_Norris	gigix	a lot
2012-06-15T23:38:00.000Z	gigix	Chuck_Norris	did you run ppa-purge to disable them and REVERT the changes done by each ppa ?
2012-06-15T23:39:00.000Z	Chuck_Norris	gigix	no, i know about that command but, i just uncheck the PPA from "Software Sources" and then, sudo apt-get update, thats all, brb
2012-06-15T23:40:00.000Z	gigix	Chuck_Norris	disabling the ppa undoes nothing unfortunately...you may have ended up with mixing version of packages from different ppa which is very bad.
2012-06-15T23:41:00.000Z	gigix	Chuck_Norris	so before trying out one ppa you have to ppa-purge the one you are currently trying
2012-06-15T23:44:00.000Z	Chuck_Norris	gigix	i know i tell him disable the x-swat PPA and try the one i gave him
2012-06-15T23:44:00.000Z	Chuck_Norris	gigix	why you question me?
2012-06-15T23:44:00.000Z	gigix	Chuck_Norris	sorry mate I was confused
2012-06-15T23:45:00.000Z	gigix	Chuck_Norris	no no, unchecking the ppa just updates the package list available, but does not revert the changes
