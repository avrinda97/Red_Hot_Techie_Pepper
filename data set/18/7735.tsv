2007-11-22T14:22:00.000Z	Amaranth	MrPocknix	you have the most up-to-date version already
2007-11-22T14:22:00.000Z	MrPocknix	Amaranth	do i?
2007-11-22T14:22:00.000Z	Amaranth	MrPocknix	The most up-to-date one you can use, yes
2007-11-22T14:23:00.000Z	Amaranth	MrPocknix	Then you need to upgrade to a newer version of Ubuntu
2007-11-22T14:32:00.000Z	Amaranth	MrPocknix	install the xmms package in synaptic
2007-11-22T14:32:00.000Z	MrPocknix	Amaranth	 come again?
2007-11-22T14:32:00.000Z	Amaranth	MrPocknix	System->Administration->Synaptic Package Manager
2007-11-22T14:34:00.000Z	MrPocknix	Amaranth	 i dont see it in there..
2007-11-22T14:35:00.000Z	Amaranth	MrPocknix	you probably don't have universe enabled
2007-11-22T14:35:00.000Z	Amaranth	MrPocknix	Are you using Ubuntu 6.06?
2007-11-22T14:36:00.000Z	Amaranth	MrPocknix	It sounds like it
2007-11-22T14:37:00.000Z	Amaranth	MrPocknix	You have Ubuntu 5.10
2007-11-22T14:37:00.000Z	Amaranth	MrPocknix	That's two years old, you should download the latest version and install it
2007-11-22T14:38:00.000Z	MrPocknix	Amaranth	 can i just update it?
2007-11-22T14:38:00.000Z	Amaranth	MrPocknix	From that old of an install it would take probably 2 days to upgrade
2007-11-22T14:38:00.000Z	Amaranth	MrPocknix	It'd be faster to download and install the new version
2007-11-22T14:39:00.000Z	Amaranth	MrPocknix	Sure but the version of Ubuntu you're using has no support of any kind and does not even get security fixes
