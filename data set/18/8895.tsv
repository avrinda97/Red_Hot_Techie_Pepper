2007-06-10T08:50:00.000Z	Thorne		kde its too much of a memory hog also
2007-06-10T08:50:00.000Z	Thorne		hm anyone here run fluxbox on feisty yet?
2007-06-10T08:51:00.000Z	Thorne		yea i run flux on my slack box

2007-06-10T08:52:00.000Z	Thorne		well gnome seems a lot more configurable to me than kde but i guess it depends on taste though
2007-06-10T08:53:00.000Z	Thorne		like macosx?
2007-06-10T08:53:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Thorne	 youve not looked in depth at kde then. :)  Thers some  neat things one can do.
2007-06-10T08:53:00.000Z	Thorne	Dr_willis	i used it for like 4 mos
2007-06-10T08:53:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Thorne	 but a lot of it is not for the 'casual user'  Koisk mode stuff and so forth.
2007-06-10T08:54:00.000Z	Thorne		well im just used to gnome, does what i want it to do so lol

2007-06-10T08:54:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Thorne	 thats the Linux mantra. :) im getting where I like "matchbox" in some cases even.. and its.. really out there in ways
2007-06-10T08:57:00.000Z	Thorne		like if theres a k app i want to use i just use it in gnome anyway
