2005-10-02T13:16:00.000Z	the_watchtower		I am still trying to figure out welcome.msg used by proftp
2005-10-02T13:18:00.000Z	thoreauputic	the_watchtower	did you get my /msg es re: ftp etc?
2005-10-02T13:20:00.000Z	the_watchtower	thoreauputic	I dont think I am getting the messeges
2005-10-02T13:21:00.000Z	thoreauputic	the_watchtower	ah - I sent you several /msg es yesterday telling you the result of my ftp attempts to your server
2005-10-02T13:21:00.000Z	the_watchtower	thoreauputic	oh yesterday  yes yes
2005-10-02T13:22:00.000Z	the_watchtower	thoreauputic	I could not get vsftp to work so I put in proftp
2005-10-02T13:23:00.000Z	the_watchtower	thoreauputic	now I have my users jailed in their home dir  --  looks like root to them
2005-10-02T13:23:00.000Z	thoreauputic	the_watchtower	ah Ok - problem solved then!
2005-10-02T13:24:00.000Z	the_watchtower	thoreauputic	I am just trying to use the welcome banner.  It is in a file called welcome.msg
2005-10-02T13:24:00.000Z	the_watchtower	thoreauputic	a line in the proftpd.conf refers to this file
2005-10-02T13:25:00.000Z	the_watchtower	thoreauputic	do you use an ftp client or just firefoc
2005-10-02T13:26:00.000Z	thoreauputic	the_watchtower	I mostly use lftp - sometimes gftp if I feel lazy ;)
2005-10-02T13:26:00.000Z	the_watchtower	thoreauputic	do you use an ftp client or just firefox
2005-10-02T13:27:00.000Z	thoreauputic	the_watchtower	using FF ?
2005-10-02T13:29:00.000Z	the_watchtower	thoreauputic	no i believe we need to use a client.  FF already doesn't show the banner
2005-10-02T13:30:00.000Z	the_watchtower	thoreauputic	the ip address is changed to  66.142.90.36
2005-10-02T13:30:00.000Z	thoreauputic	the_watchtower	well, I don't think gftp would either - and of course lftp is command line so unless it's an ASCII banner...
2005-10-02T13:32:00.000Z	the_watchtower	thoreauputic	  got my sister on the other line  please excuse me for a bit
