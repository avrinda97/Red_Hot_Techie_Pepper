2009-07-08T04:54:00.000Z	phix		hi
2009-07-08T04:55:00.000Z	phix		Why does NetworkManager exist for? it seems to conflict with /etc/network/interfaces
2009-07-08T04:55:00.000Z	cabrey	phix	that is the old debian way of manually managing network interfaces
2009-07-08T04:56:00.000Z	cabrey	phix	nm automatically configures network interfaces now
2009-07-08T04:57:00.000Z	cabrey	phix	no it doesnt
2009-07-08T04:58:00.000Z	phix	cabrey	it doesn't?
2009-07-08T04:58:00.000Z	phix	cabrey	it is deleting /dev entries though
2009-07-08T04:58:00.000Z	cabrey	phix	if that is actually the case, something is seriously wrong
2009-07-08T05:01:00.000Z	phix	cabrey	so any ideas?
2009-07-08T05:01:00.000Z	cabrey	phix	i didnt see any of your replies
2009-07-08T05:02:00.000Z	cabrey	phix	give me a quick summary
2009-07-08T05:03:00.000Z	phix	cabrey	oh, well I want to connect to my ISPs wireless (GPRS / HSDPA / UMTS or whatever service) on boot up, without logging in.  It would be nice if the user can tell if it is up or not (ie some level of NetworkManager usefulness), but that is optional
2009-07-08T05:04:00.000Z	phix	cabrey	my main issue is, when I do log into the GUI, the NetworkManager tries to reconfigure my wireless device, as a consiquence the /dev/ttyUSB[0-2] devices get removed, which causes my established network connection to die
2009-07-08T05:04:00.000Z	phix	cabrey	did you get all of that/
2009-07-08T05:05:00.000Z	cabrey	phix	yes, I have never heard of nm trying to manipulate device files before O_o
2009-07-08T05:05:00.000Z	cabrey	phix	are you running it as root by chance?
2009-07-08T05:05:00.000Z	phix	cabrey	well it is either doing to directly, or unloading and loading the module again, which is havinbg the same effect
2009-07-08T05:07:00.000Z	cabrey	phix	well that sounds like a major bug so if you have a launchpad account you could report a bug there :/
