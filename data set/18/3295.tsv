2009-11-03T23:21:00.000Z	grawity	BA^	There's always the "download the official build" way... that's how many people got 3.5 in Jaunty.
2009-11-03T23:25:00.000Z	grawity	BA^	irssi <3   Also, weechat / Xchat / Konversation / maybe Pidgin
2009-11-03T23:25:00.000Z	BA^	grawity	is irssi in the add/remove ? or do I have to d/l it and install it manually? not on jaunty right now...
2009-11-03T23:26:00.000Z	grawity	BA^	It's in the repositories, that I know for sure.
2009-11-03T23:26:00.000Z	BA^	grawity	thanks, then i'll try it later
2009-11-03T23:28:00.000Z	grawity	BA^	Heh, I still have pIRCH'98 somewhere. And it runs on Wine too.
2009-11-03T23:28:00.000Z	BA^	grawity	i loved pirch cuz i could script the hell out of it. does irssi allow scripting?
2009-11-03T23:29:00.000Z	grawity	BA^	Yeah. Perl :)
2009-11-03T23:30:00.000Z	grawity	BA^	If you're afraid of Perl, both Xchat and WeeChat support Python too (and a few other languages, which I don't remember)
2009-11-03T23:30:00.000Z	BA^	grawity	not afraid... just don't know it. but i'm sure i can learn
