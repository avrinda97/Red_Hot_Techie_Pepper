2006-11-11T08:27:00.000Z	fiveiron	Poromenos	do you have access to the DHCP server?
2006-11-11T08:27:00.000Z	Poromenos	fiveiron	i do
2006-11-11T08:27:00.000Z	Poromenos		my router is bugged and returns 1.0.0.0 for DNS requests
2006-11-11T08:27:00.000Z	fiveiron	Poromenos	then just set up the DNS servers in the dhcpd.conf
2006-11-11T08:27:00.000Z	fiveiron		on the DHCP server
2006-11-11T08:28:00.000Z	Poromenos		ah, it's a router, and i have set those up, it's not getting them
2006-11-11T08:28:00.000Z	Poromenos		can i just set them up manually on the client?
2006-11-11T08:28:00.000Z	Poromenos		like, static ip and all
2006-11-11T08:28:00.000Z	fiveiron	Poromenos	are you talking a LOCAL dhcp server?  or your ISP?
2006-11-11T08:28:00.000Z	Poromenos	fiveiron	my local dhcp
2006-11-11T08:28:00.000Z	Poromenos		actually, how can i set a static ip?
2006-11-11T08:28:00.000Z	fiveiron		and you have a line like this in your dhcpd.conf:  option domain-name-servers 208.67.222.222, 208.67.220.220;
2006-11-11T08:29:00.000Z	Poromenos	fiveiron	i configured it through its web interface
