2008-11-23T19:30:00.000Z	tim167		hello, i need help with remote desktop. how do i connect to a machine that is not on my local network ?
2008-11-23T19:31:00.000Z	LinkOps	tim167	you would need to know the remote pc curtrent IP address
2008-11-23T19:54:00.000Z	LinkOps	tim167	do you know what the IP address is of the remote machine
2008-11-23T19:54:00.000Z	tim167	LinkOps	yes but when i enter it i get 'connection closed'
2008-11-23T19:55:00.000Z	LinkOps	tim167	see if you can get VNC Server installed on the remote machine (tightvnc) and then get a vnc client on ur machine and use the ip address
2008-11-23T19:58:00.000Z	LinkOps	tim167	if you search on google - port forarding (router model number) .. that should get u a walkthrough
2008-11-23T19:58:00.000Z	tim167	LinkOps	ok, i hope the person can find out her router model number...
2008-11-23T20:00:00.000Z	LinkOps	tim167	if you only need it for today you could try logmein remote on a trial basis
2008-11-23T20:01:00.000Z	tim167	LinkOps	i would need it for more than today...
2008-11-23T20:01:00.000Z	LinkOps	tim167	bare with me a second i know its like a 15day trial just getting you the address for it
2008-11-23T20:02:00.000Z	tim167	LinkOps	ok cool
2008-11-23T20:04:00.000Z	LinkOps	tim167	www.logmeinrescue.com you set an account up get a job reference pin and give that to your friend. he then goes to www.123rescue.com and types the pin then you can take control so long as he accepts everything (URL's could be wrong)
2008-11-23T20:04:00.000Z	tim167	LinkOps	ok I'll definitely try it out thanks
2008-11-23T20:04:00.000Z	LinkOps	tim167	worst case if your account trial expires just register a different email address.
2008-11-23T20:05:00.000Z	tim167	LinkOps	neat :)
2008-11-23T20:06:00.000Z	LinkOps	tim167	If your going to be giving constant remote assistance to this machine i would also recommend www.logmein.com as you can have a free account with them
2008-11-23T20:10:00.000Z	tim167	LinkOps	thanks, checking now...
2008-11-23T20:10:00.000Z	LinkOps	tim167	welcome :)
