2011-09-03T07:32:00.000Z	Phong_		i can't install ubuntu why?
2011-09-03T07:32:00.000Z	Phong_		it said something about busybox
2011-09-03T07:32:00.000Z	Phong_		then type 'help' for help
2011-09-03T07:32:00.000Z	Phong_		something wrong with ubuntu?
2011-09-03T07:34:00.000Z	Phong_		11.04
2011-09-03T07:34:00.000Z	Phong_		x64 bit
2011-09-03T07:34:00.000Z	Phong_		weird
2011-09-03T07:34:00.000Z	Phong_		will it handle by i7 2600k?
2011-09-03T07:35:00.000Z	Hypershock	Phong_	what are you machines specs?
2011-09-03T07:35:00.000Z	Phong_	Hypershock	i7 2600k 12RAM
2011-09-03T07:35:00.000Z	Phong_		80GB SSD intel
2011-09-03T07:36:00.000Z	Hypershock		are you installing from a dvd or a bootable usb?
2011-09-03T07:36:00.000Z	Phong_	Hypershock	CD or DVD
2011-09-03T07:37:00.000Z	Hypershock		ok, so you mean you tried both then
2011-09-03T07:37:00.000Z	Phong_		yes
2011-09-03T07:37:00.000Z	Hypershock		ok, now try the one you don't want to try, the standard 32bit one, it'll install a pae kernel so you won't loose access to your ram
2011-09-03T07:38:00.000Z	Hypershock		in fact it'll run better too as x64 is still experimental
2011-09-03T07:38:00.000Z	Phong_	Hypershock	come on man, i want x64
