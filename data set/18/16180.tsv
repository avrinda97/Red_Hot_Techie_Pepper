2004-11-08T08:59:00.000Z	fluoro		It's missing a couple things that I would like though.
2004-11-08T08:59:00.000Z	geppy	fluoro	 It sucks at not being a memory hog.
2004-11-08T09:00:00.000Z	geppy	fluoro	 It also sucks at having features that every sound app should have, such as the ability to select your sound preferences.
2004-11-08T09:03:00.000Z	geppy	fluoro	 Well, there isn't.
2004-11-08T09:03:00.000Z	fluoro	geppy	That's my complaint with it.  Not being able to reorder or rename things.
2004-11-08T09:03:00.000Z	geppy	fluoro	 Yeah.
2004-11-08T09:04:00.000Z	fluoro	geppy	Then someone should fucking make one and stop blaming some music player that has nothing to do with that, and shouldn't have anything to do with that.
2004-11-08T09:04:00.000Z	geppy	fluoro	 I would like to, really, but no one would use it.
2004-11-08T09:10:00.000Z	fluoro	geppy	I'd be all down with working on a music player that doesn't suck, but I'd be more interested in working on it in Gtk#.  Doing this GUI shit in C sort of sucks.
2004-11-08T09:10:00.000Z	geppy	fluoro	 How so?
2004-11-08T09:10:00.000Z	fluoro	geppy	It's so much less productive of a language for this sort of stuff.
2004-11-08T09:11:00.000Z	geppy	fluoro	 It's more portable, though, isn't it?
2004-11-08T09:12:00.000Z	fluoro	geppy	Technically speaking, yes.  But how portable does it need to be?  You're basically aiming for users who use Gnome and 95% or more of them are Linux users.
2004-11-08T09:12:00.000Z	geppy	fluoro	 True, but porting it to Windows would be neat.  Hell, I'd never use it, but I'd sell it to my friends.  :)
2004-11-08T09:13:00.000Z	fluoro	geppy	Gtk# runs on Windows.  It doesn't look native, but that's not my problem.
2004-11-08T09:13:00.000Z	geppy	fluoro	 True, but the people using it care.
2004-11-08T09:13:00.000Z	geppy	fluoro	 Odds are, the devs aren't going to be the ones using it, but if they let the fact that they don't care show, no one would be using it.
