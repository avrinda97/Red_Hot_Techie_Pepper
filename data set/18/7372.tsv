2009-01-13T15:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	CrypTom	if you are doing multiple users i'd do it in a script
2009-01-13T15:13:00.000Z	CrypTom	ActionParsnip	thats what I did, the first 800 of our pupils were generated ok, the last 137 produced errors
2009-01-13T15:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	CrypTom	not sure, you could try a reboot just to test
2009-01-13T15:13:00.000Z	CrypTom	ActionParsnip	I used useradd and usermod (to change already existing users)
2009-01-13T15:14:00.000Z	CrypTom	ActionParsnip	I already did
2009-01-13T15:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	CrypTom	is it scripted to generate them or are you typing them in by hand?
2009-01-13T15:14:00.000Z	CrypTom	ActionParsnip	the users are ready from a file exported from our school management software
2009-01-13T15:15:00.000Z	CrypTom	ActionParsnip	s/ready/read/
2009-01-13T15:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	CrypTom	can you manually add users at cli
2009-01-13T15:16:00.000Z	CrypTom	ActionParsnip	I can, but the primary group is created automatically with the username, when I specify my own primary group (the class the user attends), I get an error that the group does not exist
2009-01-13T15:17:00.000Z	CrypTom	ActionParsnip	I can no longer change _any_ group of any user with usermod!

2009-01-13T15:20:00.000Z	CrypTom	ActionParsnip	thanks for the link, but I'm using the latest (8.10) ubuntu server, so it almost certainly cant be due to an old glibc, right?!
2009-01-13T15:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	CrypTom	theres no concrete answer to that
2009-01-13T15:20:00.000Z	CrypTom	ActionParsnip	ok
2009-01-13T15:41:00.000Z	CrypTom	ActionParsnip	found a solution: a split the line (e.g. of the audio group) onto two lines, so I 've got two lines starting with:    audio:x:29:
2009-01-13T15:41:00.000Z	CrypTom	ActionParsnip	now, usermod/useradd work again
2009-01-13T15:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	CrypTom	wtg dude, nice job
