2009-12-10T17:59:00.000Z	jess_nc		m here to have a help to resolve a problem, can i?
2009-12-10T18:00:00.000Z	jess_nc		ok :) thanks! ^_^ well... I've change my root fs from reiserfs to ext4. I made a backup of my reiserfs, create a new empty ext4, cp -a old_one/* new_one/, update-initramfs...
2009-12-10T18:01:00.000Z	jess_nc		update grub...
2009-12-10T18:01:00.000Z	jess_nc		copy stage files (ever if there are some updates)

2009-12-10T18:01:00.000Z	nperry	jess_nc	Any error messgae(s)
2009-12-10T18:06:00.000Z	nperry	jess_nc	2.6.31 is the best for ext4 support more stable
2009-12-10T18:07:00.000Z	jess_nc	nperry	ok, i note that
2009-12-10T18:08:00.000Z	nperry	jess_nc	What version of grub?
2009-12-10T18:10:00.000Z	nperry	jess_nc	Are you able to re-chroot in to upgrade grub to grub2
2009-12-10T18:11:00.000Z	nperry	jess_nc	IIRC grub 0.97 doesnt really understand ext4 - Not saying it will fix it as may chuck up another error
2009-12-10T18:12:00.000Z	jess_nc	nperry	but the patch developed by Ubuntu is available also for Debian? I wonder
2009-12-10T18:13:00.000Z	nperry	jess_nc	Not to sure if its been pushed upstream
2009-12-10T18:13:00.000Z	jess_nc	nperry	i'd better install the last ubuntu's grub, I guess
2009-12-10T18:18:00.000Z	jess_nc	nperry	(I read the patch has been applied on ubuntu's grub package since 0.97-29ubuntu47 https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/grub/+bug/314350 and i have 0.97-29ubuntu59 installed in memory (on live ubuntu on usb stick))
2009-12-10T18:23:00.000Z	jess_nc	nperry	i will try again to get more informations ^^
