2009-11-03T22:43:00.000Z	Haitham		I'm gonna try GParted for now, although I have another question - How do i get rid of "Authentication" windows, they keep coming, can't I just authenticate once for good?
2009-11-03T22:44:00.000Z	FCalderon	Haitham	those windows are placed for your own security
2009-11-03T22:45:00.000Z	FCalderon	Haitham	 there are some changes that could seriously damage your operating system install, by seeing those password requests, you know that you're about to modify something "important"
2009-11-03T22:45:00.000Z	FCalderon	Haitham	and once you enter your password, it won't ask for it again for some time
2009-11-03T22:48:00.000Z	FCalderon	Haitham	if you really want to remove the password requests, add your user to the /etc/sudoers file
2009-11-03T22:48:00.000Z	FCalderon	Haitham	yes
2009-11-03T22:49:00.000Z	FCalderon	Haitham	add a line that goes yourusername ALL=NOPASSWD: ALL
2009-11-03T22:51:00.000Z	FCalderon	Haitham	trust me, you'll be safer leaving ubuntu as it is...
2009-11-03T22:51:00.000Z	FCalderon	Haitham	yes
2009-11-03T22:52:00.000Z	FCalderon	Haitham	Ubuntu is a linux distribution
2009-11-03T22:53:00.000Z	FCalderon	Haitham	yes
2009-11-03T22:55:00.000Z	FCalderon	Haitham	just as a side note, being open source isn't the only advantage of linux based distributions... and being open source isn't something that only Linux is, there are other open source operating systems
2009-11-03T22:57:00.000Z	FCalderon	Haitham	make sure that you're copying them back to the right location and restart firefox
2009-11-03T22:58:00.000Z	FCalderon	Haitham	can't help, I've never backed them up that wa
2009-11-03T22:58:00.000Z	FCalderon	Haitham	can't help, I've never backed them up that way
2009-11-03T23:12:00.000Z	FCalderon	Haitham	by MSN you mean??? Microsoft's passport? Microsoft's Messenger? or what ?
2009-11-03T23:12:00.000Z	FCalderon	Haitham	MSN stands for Microsoft Network, not for Microsoft's Messenger
2009-11-04T00:08:00.000Z	FCalderon	Haitham	everything about or related to Microsoft is confusing :)
