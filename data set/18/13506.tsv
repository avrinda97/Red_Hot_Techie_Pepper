2005-11-19T15:17:00.000Z	clb_		umount: /media/KINGSTON is not in the fstab (and you are not root)
2005-11-19T15:18:00.000Z	NoUse	clb_	what shows up in "Computer" in gnome?
2005-11-19T15:18:00.000Z	clb_	NoUse	I don't see the usb drive on the left side, but on the right side is an item 'Kingston DataTraveler'
2005-11-19T15:19:00.000Z	NoUse	clb_	right click that and click unmount
2005-11-19T15:19:00.000Z	clb_	NoUse	when I click on it, I get an error.. can't mount, alreaydy mounted
2005-11-19T15:19:00.000Z	clb_	NoUse	there's no such option when I rightclick
