2008-06-27T19:33:00.000Z	jetsaredim		is there a way to tell what program has a given port open on my system?
2008-06-27T19:33:00.000Z	gabbler	jetsaredim	try netstat as well
2008-06-27T19:35:00.000Z	gabbler	jetsaredim	that is dns
2008-06-27T19:36:00.000Z	jetsaredim	gabbler	i'm not running anything on there explicitly other than the program that I want to run that's saying something's already there
2008-06-27T19:37:00.000Z	gabbler	jetsaredim	yea but dns is a client thing that will fire up to reolve ip
2008-06-27T19:38:00.000Z	jetsaredim	gabbler	so why is it listed as "LISTEN" in netstat
2008-06-27T19:51:00.000Z	gabbler	jetsaredim	odd, i am looking at the mo
2008-06-27T20:07:00.000Z	jetsaredim	gabbler	seems that dnsmasq is running
2008-06-27T20:09:00.000Z	gabbler	jetsaredim	google, says that dnsmasq is a package in itself, you should be able to remove it
2008-06-27T20:09:00.000Z	jetsaredim	gabbler	dpkg -l dnsmasq turns up nothing
2008-06-27T20:10:00.000Z	jetsaredim	gabbler	ahh - dnsmasq-base ... what is the command for finding out what depends on a given package
2008-06-27T20:12:00.000Z	gabbler	jetsaredim	dpkg -i
2008-06-27T20:12:00.000Z	jetsaredim	gabbler	libvirt-bin grrr
2008-06-27T20:13:00.000Z	gabbler	jetsaredim	are you using libvirt for vitualbox?
2008-06-27T20:13:00.000Z	gabbler	jetsaredim	cos i dont
2008-06-27T20:14:00.000Z	jetsaredim	gabbler	have kvm install and was using virt-manager
2008-06-27T20:14:00.000Z	gabbler	jetsaredim	ah
2008-06-27T20:14:00.000Z	gabbler	jetsaredim	well get rid of it then :)
