2011-02-05T04:48:00.000Z	Confused		 Hi, I am having a DVD playback problem.  Any experts in here who can help me a bit?
2011-02-05T04:50:00.000Z	Confused		After updating from 8.04 to 10.04, DVD's no longer playback.  I get a variety of error messages depending upon what application I am trying to use.  libdvdcss4 seems to be working all right.  I can see the generated keys.  There seems to be some other problem.

2011-02-05T04:51:00.000Z	usr13	Confused	Try mplayer or different player and look for errors that will give you a clue.../
2011-02-05T04:52:00.000Z	usr13	Confused	Have you tried mplayer?
2011-02-05T04:52:00.000Z	usr13	Confused	Or....?
2011-02-05T04:57:00.000Z	usr13	Confused	they give same error?
2011-02-05T04:58:00.000Z	usr13	Confused	 Did you run vlc or mplayer from command line?
2011-02-05T05:03:00.000Z	usr13	Confused	Mplayer must be broken.  Try to upgrade or re-install mplayer or smplayer
2011-02-05T05:06:00.000Z	usr13	Confused	How about libdvdcss ?
2011-02-05T05:08:00.000Z	usr13	Confused	Maybe codecs need to be installed or re-installed, (not complete or lacking in some way)...
2011-02-05T05:08:00.000Z	usr13	Confused	DO you have GStreamer codecs ?
2011-02-05T05:11:00.000Z	usr13	Confused	Try installing mplayer from http://www.mplayerhq.hu/design7/news.html
2011-02-05T05:12:00.000Z	usr13	Confused	I'm still thinking it's a video driver prolem.  See  http://www.mplayerhq.hu/design7/news.html
2011-02-05T05:13:00.000Z	usr13	Confused	Let me ask you this;  Is this 10.04 system fully updated?
2011-02-05T05:14:00.000Z	usr13	Confused	What command are you using to tell mplayer to play DVD?
2011-02-05T05:17:00.000Z	usr13	Confused	Any luck with just mplayer dvd://
2011-02-05T05:17:00.000Z	usr13	Confused	Very good.  sorry...
