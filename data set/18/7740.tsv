2007-11-22T04:01:00.000Z	stroogle_		i have a kubuntu live cd and i want to install it on an existing server - how can i do that without blatting what's on the box already?
2007-11-22T04:02:00.000Z	stroogle_		erm, anyone?
2007-11-22T04:04:00.000Z	stroogle_		about using a kubuntu live cd without blatting existing server install
2007-11-22T04:05:00.000Z	stroogle_		how should this be done?
2007-11-22T04:06:00.000Z	soundray	stroogle_	you can run the installation and resize the existing partitions to create a dual-boot system.
2007-11-22T04:07:00.000Z	stroogle_	soundray	- i see, is adding a desktop to a server not a goer then?
2007-11-22T04:07:00.000Z	soundray	stroogle_	it is. That's what I'm trying to say.
2007-11-22T04:07:00.000Z	soundray	stroogle_	oh, I see, you just want to convert your server into a desktop?
2007-11-22T04:08:00.000Z	soundray	stroogle_	'sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop' will do that for you.
2007-11-22T04:08:00.000Z	stroogle_	soundray	- but if it's dual boot it can be either a server OR a desktop whereas i would like the server to have all the graphical widgets after being headless
2007-11-22T04:08:00.000Z	stroogle_	soundray	i'll try that
2007-11-22T04:08:00.000Z	soundray	stroogle_	you need a couple of gigabytes of space for that
2007-11-22T04:09:00.000Z	stroogle_	soundray	- space is there - i was hoping to get it off the cd rather than download over https
2007-11-22T04:09:00.000Z	stroogle_	soundray	- http
2007-11-22T04:10:00.000Z	soundray	stroogle_	unless you have the alternate install CD, you'll have to download the packages.
2007-11-22T04:11:00.000Z	stroogle_	soundray	- will do
2007-11-22T04:11:00.000Z	soundray	stroogle_	good luck
2007-11-22T05:03:00.000Z	stroogle_	soundray	- good one, kubuntu rocks, thanks
