2005-04-17T05:52:00.000Z	etzerd		Is there a special password in ubuntu beside the root password that I don't know?
2005-04-17T05:52:00.000Z	LinuxJones	etzerd	do you have the root account enabled or are you using sudo normally ?
2005-04-17T05:56:00.000Z	LinuxJones	etzerd	the root account is locked by default login using the account you created during install and use sudo for root access.
2005-04-17T05:57:00.000Z	LinuxJones	etzerd	sudo -s (enter your user password) and you basically have a root terminal
2005-04-17T06:02:00.000Z	etzerd	LinuxJones	I drop to Root/Console I type "sudo -u root it still don't work
2005-04-17T06:03:00.000Z	LinuxJones	etzerd	it's sudo -s
2005-04-17T06:04:00.000Z	LinuxJones	etzerd	yes it will ask for your password, enter your user password
2005-05-23T08:18:00.000Z	LinuxJones	etzerd	right click the one you don't want and delete it
2005-05-23T08:20:00.000Z	LinuxJones	etzerd	you can add a window list to the top panel by right clicking the panel and selecting "add to panel"
2005-05-23T08:21:00.000Z	LinuxJones	etzerd	:)
2005-05-23T08:21:00.000Z	LinuxJones	etzerd	you probably will want to add a workspace switcher to the top bar as well
