2009-04-22T14:26:00.000Z	zetheroo		﻿phcoder1: why do they make it so easy to get into someones user account?
2009-04-22T14:26:00.000Z	wgrant	zetheroo	If somebody has physical access to any computer, they can do whatever they want without knowing the username or password.
2009-04-22T14:27:00.000Z	wgrant	zetheroo	It's the same with any operating system, unless you use full disk encryption.
2009-04-22T14:28:00.000Z	wgrant	zetheroo	Networking threats, or threats from applications running within the operating system.
2009-04-22T14:31:00.000Z	wgrant	zetheroo	It's an option in the alternative installer.
2009-04-22T14:32:00.000Z	wgrant	zetheroo	Unless you want to get really complicated, yes. It has to move all of your data around a lot, which is hard.
2009-04-22T14:33:00.000Z	wgrant	zetheroo	No. It's a big performance hit, because the CPU has to do a *lot* of work, and everything has to go through the CPU.
2009-11-10T11:28:00.000Z	wgrant	zetheroo	install 'openssh-server'. That's it.
2009-11-10T11:28:00.000Z	zetheroo	wgrant	thank you
2009-11-10T11:30:00.000Z	wgrant	zetheroo	I use SFTP between most of my hosts.
2009-11-10T11:30:00.000Z	wgrant	zetheroo	Except when I need something permanent, in which case I use NFS4
2009-11-10T11:31:00.000Z	zetheroo	wgrant	oh so its not permanent?
2009-11-10T11:31:00.000Z	wgrant	zetheroo	Depends what you mean.
2009-11-10T11:32:00.000Z	wgrant	zetheroo	For your situation it is more than likely fine. Don't worry about it.
2009-11-10T11:32:00.000Z	zetheroo	wgrant	well, after reboot will the shares still be there?
2009-11-10T11:32:00.000Z	wgrant	zetheroo	If you connect to them using Places->Connect to server..., yes.
2009-11-10T11:33:00.000Z	zetheroo	wgrant	even after a reboot they will still be there in the menu ... also what about sharing printer?
