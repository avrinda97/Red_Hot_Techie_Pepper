2005-10-08T12:34:00.000Z	Lord_Maynoth		I wonder if they will branch off into drivers in the far future
2005-10-08T12:36:00.000Z	Lord_Maynoth		well at what point do you guys think that linux will be completely installable, configureable, and usable without the command line
2005-10-08T12:36:00.000Z	Lord_Maynoth		perhaps thats a better question
2005-10-08T12:37:00.000Z	Lord_Maynoth		maybe I should just go back to dos
2005-10-08T12:37:00.000Z	Lord_Maynoth		LOL
2005-10-08T12:39:00.000Z	Lord_Maynoth		i hate apt-get

2005-10-08T12:41:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Lord_Maynoth	not true - you can compile on Ubuntu if you wish for example - besides which th erepos have > 17 000 packages...
2005-10-08T12:42:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Lord_Maynoth	learning the command line will set you free ;)
2005-10-08T12:54:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Lord_Maynoth	#ubuntu-offtopic exists, you know
2005-10-08T12:55:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Lord_Maynoth	in fact #ubuntu-offtopic can be *very* offtopic
2005-10-08T12:56:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Lord_Maynoth	look at the O'Reilly website as a start I guess
2005-10-08T12:57:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Lord_Maynoth	http://tuxfiles.org
2005-10-08T12:58:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Lord_Maynoth	O'Reilly publish "Linux in a Nutshell" for instance
2005-10-08T12:58:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Lord_Maynoth	sudo apt-get install apt-howto *grin*
