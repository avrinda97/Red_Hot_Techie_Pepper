2006-09-11T07:33:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Daniel0	when you choose gnome from sessions, it will ask you on login if you want it as default
2006-09-11T07:22:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Daniel0	your password, assuming you are the first user configured on the box
2006-09-11T07:23:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Daniel0	did you use the "expert" install ?
2006-09-11T07:23:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Daniel0	your /etc/sudoers should have the admin user enabled, and you need to be in the admin group
2006-09-11T07:25:00.000Z	Daniel0	thoreauputic	it is
2006-09-11T07:25:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Daniel0	then your password should work - is this dapper 6.06 LTS ?
2006-09-11T07:26:00.000Z	Daniel0	thoreauputic	yeah
2006-09-11T07:26:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Daniel0	and you are sure your user is in the admin group? Type "groups" without quotes to see
2006-09-11T07:27:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Daniel0	so it's only GUI apps that cause trouble?
2006-09-11T07:28:00.000Z	Daniel0	thoreauputic	well, on the login screen it i can click on a button that says 'sessions' (or something like that), then i can choose 'configure login manager'. then without having entered a username it switches to password, and when i enter my password it just says 'wrong password'
2006-09-11T07:29:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Daniel0	try configuring it from gnome after logging in
2006-09-11T07:30:00.000Z	Daniel0	thoreauputic	is that System > Administration > Login Window?
2006-09-11T07:30:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Daniel0	yes, sounds right
2006-09-11T07:32:00.000Z	Daniel0	thoreauputic	then how would i set gnome as the default desktop enviroment?
2006-09-11T07:34:00.000Z	Daniel0	thoreauputic	no... it just closes and then i can login into gnome. then next time i want to log in i will have to do it again
2006-09-11T07:35:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Daniel0	erm - here it asks every time that you change the session - else it uses the default
2006-09-11T07:35:00.000Z	Daniel0	thoreauputic	is there another way to do it then?
2006-09-11T07:36:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Daniel0	I don't understand the problem - if you want gnome, tell it to give you gnome - if youwant something else, choose that and tell it to make that your default wen it asks
