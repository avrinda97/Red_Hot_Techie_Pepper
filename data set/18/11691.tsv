2006-06-24T16:19:00.000Z	zenit	Ap0s7le	I've done a very simple setup. But the svn book explains it quite well.
2006-06-24T16:20:00.000Z	Ap0s7le	zenit	may I PM you? This many people is crazy :)
2006-06-24T16:21:00.000Z	zenit	Ap0s7le	rather not. Ask your questions in the channel to also let other people respond, and to let others learn.
2006-06-24T16:22:00.000Z	Ap0s7le		Ok zenit... So what is a simple setup in your case?
2006-06-24T16:22:00.000Z	zenit	Ap0s7le	just a simple, private repository for a small project. I used Apache2 and mod_dav_svn
2006-06-24T16:23:00.000Z	zenit	Ap0s7le	I didn't even bother setting up any security, but that's described quite well in the svn book at subversion.tigris.org
2006-06-24T16:23:00.000Z	Ap0s7le	zenit	does it allow you to access it over the web from remote locations? If so, is it secure and how do you like it?
2006-06-24T16:23:00.000Z	Ap0s7le		Just caught your last message when I hit enter.
2006-06-24T16:24:00.000Z	zenit	Ap0s7le	no problem. I can be set up securely yes, I just set it up this way while testing and since it's a private network I didn't bother changing it.
2006-06-24T16:24:00.000Z	zenit	Ap0s7le	But all that's needed for authentication is there.
2006-06-24T16:25:00.000Z	Ap0s7le	zenit	is this the area I need to be looking in? http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.0/ch06.html
2006-06-24T16:27:00.000Z	zenit	Ap0s7le	absolutely, that's where I looked. I wasn't familiar with svn either, so chapter 2 & 3 proved quite uesful tool.
2006-06-24T16:27:00.000Z	zenit		too
2006-06-24T16:27:00.000Z	zenit	Ap0s7le	It's a very good book btw.
2006-06-24T16:27:00.000Z	Ap0s7le		Thank you zenit, I appreciate your time.
2006-06-24T16:28:00.000Z	zenit	Ap0s7le	np
