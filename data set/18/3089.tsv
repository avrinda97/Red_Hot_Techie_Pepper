2010-02-15T04:22:00.000Z	bikcmp		Hello all, kinda having a issue with my server: I accidently used apt-get install php5 & (note the &) and keeps running although detatched.
2010-02-15T04:23:00.000Z	bikcmp		I've killed it with ps x a few times but keeps coming back
2010-02-15T04:23:00.000Z	bikcmp		any ideas?
2010-02-15T04:24:00.000Z	bikcmp		and now apt won't die
2010-02-15T04:25:00.000Z	erUSUL	bikcmp	tried --> « fg %1 »
2010-02-15T04:25:00.000Z	bikcmp	erUSUL	try that command?
2010-02-15T04:25:00.000Z	erUSUL	bikcmp	that should bring apt back to the terminal
2010-02-15T04:25:00.000Z	bikcmp	erUSUL	hrm
2010-02-15T04:26:00.000Z	erUSUL	bikcmp	run « jobs »
2010-02-15T04:26:00.000Z	bikcmp	erUSUL	nothing happens
2010-02-15T04:26:00.000Z	erUSUL	bikcmp	are you sure apt is still running?
2010-02-15T04:26:00.000Z	bikcmp	erUSUL	ps x: 20092 pts/0    T      0:00 apt-get install php5-
2010-02-15T04:27:00.000Z	erUSUL	bikcmp	sudo kill 20092
2010-02-15T04:27:00.000Z	erUSUL	bikcmp	apt is run with sudo must be killed with sudo
2010-02-15T04:27:00.000Z	bikcmp	erUSUL	it doesn't do anything with sudo either
2010-02-15T04:28:00.000Z	erUSUL	bikcmp	sudo kill -9 20092
2010-02-15T04:29:00.000Z	erUSUL	bikcmp	send the sigkill signal a signal that processes can not avoid
2010-02-15T04:29:00.000Z	erUSUL	bikcmp	should not be used lightly
