2008-04-01T07:58:00.000Z	Flannel	Shi	yes
2008-04-01T07:59:00.000Z	Flannel	Shi	You have ssh on your windows box?  I suggest PuTTy.  But, it should work fine (assuming thats the syntax).  Make sure you've port forwarded properly if you're behind a router
2008-04-01T08:00:00.000Z	Flannel	Shi	You don't need 22 open on the client box, just the server box.  It already is open on the server, you just need to forward if you're doing the router thing
2008-04-01T08:01:00.000Z	Flannel	Shi	If you're both behind the same router, you won't need to forward to reach it (just go to the LAN ip of the server)
2008-04-01T08:02:00.000Z	Flannel	Shi	right, for that you'll need to forward port 22 in the router to point to your server
2008-04-01T08:09:00.000Z	Flannel	Shi	The nice thing about using sudo over su is you can give him access to certain things, and not others (apt-get but not fdisk, or whatnot)
2008-04-01T08:10:00.000Z	Flannel	Shi	You'll need to hand-edit your sudoers, but yes.
