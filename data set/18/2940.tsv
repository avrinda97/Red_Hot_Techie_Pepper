2010-01-20T05:11:00.000Z	m0ar		I accidently pressed some hotkeys, and now I'm having american keyboard setup. In windows it's alt+shift, what's up with ubuntu?
2010-01-20T05:11:00.000Z	mAriachi	m0ar	go to preferences>keyboard>layout
2010-01-20T05:12:00.000Z	mAriachi	m0ar	you can set everything from there
2010-01-20T05:12:00.000Z	m0ar	mAriachi	Well, any idea of what hotkey I was hitting?
2010-01-20T05:13:00.000Z	mAriachi	m0ar	nope :( you can set everything, even the shortcut (key-combination) there
2010-01-20T05:13:00.000Z	m0ar	mAriachi	Ah, saw that now. Thank you!
2010-01-20T05:14:00.000Z	mAriachi	m0ar	anytime dude! glad i could help!, to be of further help, add the Keyboard layout applet on your panel, it's like the windows language bar
2010-01-20T05:14:00.000Z	m0ar	mAriachi	I'd rather die :)
2010-01-20T05:14:00.000Z	m0ar	mAriachi	 :D
2010-01-20T05:14:00.000Z	mAriachi	m0ar	haha, i meant if you got to change layouts like me
2010-01-20T05:15:00.000Z	m0ar	mAriachi	more like, purge the hotkeys for changing layout to infinity
2010-01-20T05:15:00.000Z	mAriachi	m0ar	i'm from macedonia and sometimes i need the macedonian keyboard
2010-01-20T05:15:00.000Z	m0ar	mAriachi	You are so unlucky :c
2010-01-20T05:15:00.000Z	mAriachi	m0ar	and it's good to know in which layout im typing
2010-01-20T05:15:00.000Z	m0ar	mAriachi	Or well, it's problable my used to the windoose "OHMYGAWD RANDOM MESSAGE"-popups
2010-01-20T05:16:00.000Z	mAriachi	m0ar	cause it can happen sometimes like these иф ај тајп енд сетера
2010-01-20T05:16:00.000Z	m0ar	mAriachi	;)
2010-01-20T05:17:00.000Z	mAriachi	m0ar	dont worry those things dont happen in ubuntu
