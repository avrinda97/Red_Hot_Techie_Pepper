2008-01-22T23:04:00.000Z	DRebellion	frikkie	mp3 is a proprietary format. it is not packaged on the cd because of this.
2008-01-22T23:04:00.000Z	frikkie	DRebellion	oh okay. Didnt know mp3 is proprietary
2008-01-22T23:24:00.000Z	DRebellion	frikkie	tried any other players?
2008-01-22T23:25:00.000Z	frikkie	DRebellion	I got this file: xmms-1.2.10-1.i386 but I dont know what to do with it
2008-01-22T23:29:00.000Z	frikkie	DRebellion	Can't I just download an installer and run it?
2008-01-22T23:29:00.000Z	frikkie	DRebellion	For xmms?
2008-01-22T23:29:00.000Z	DRebellion	frikkie	you could download the xmms source code and compile it yourself
2008-01-22T23:30:00.000Z	DRebellion	frikkie	700mb
2008-01-22T23:30:00.000Z	frikkie	DRebellion	holy crap dude
2008-01-22T23:33:00.000Z	DRebellion	frikkie	you only download what you need to update. nowhere near 700mb
2008-01-22T23:33:00.000Z	frikkie	DRebellion	Will that continue until v8 and 9 etc?
2008-01-22T23:34:00.000Z	DRebellion	frikkie	just - 1) Download the gutsy iso image 2) Burn it to disc 3) Do a clean install
2008-01-22T23:34:00.000Z	frikkie	DRebellion	Okay..... will do that.
