2007-10-01T16:57:00.000Z	oxeimon		you mean roaming mode doesn't work for you either?
2007-10-01T16:57:00.000Z	oxeimon		I see.
2007-10-01T16:57:00.000Z	oxeimon		hmm
2007-10-01T16:58:00.000Z	oxeimon		well, I can't test this here, I'd have to go somewhere else to test if this works
2007-10-01T16:58:00.000Z	oxeimon		so I guess if it doesn't, someone else will have to put up with my complaining
2007-10-01T16:58:00.000Z	oxeimon		k
2007-10-01T16:59:00.000Z	oxeimon		thanks :-D
2007-10-01T14:13:00.000Z	oxeimon		sudo: unable to execute ./install: Permission denied
2007-10-01T14:13:00.000Z	oxeimon		I'm trying to install matlab on my computer, but when I do "sudo ./install", I get: "sudo: unable to execute ./install: Permission denied"

2007-10-01T14:20:00.000Z	oxeimon	genii	So you would suggest copying the contents of the dvd into some folder?
