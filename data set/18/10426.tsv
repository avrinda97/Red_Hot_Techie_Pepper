2007-01-19T11:58:00.000Z	christian1222		howdy, does anyone know how to mount an .iso file without burning it to a cd?
2007-01-19T11:58:00.000Z	christian1222		its a dvd iso
2007-01-19T11:58:00.000Z	Tonren	christian1222	Yeah.  You can use "sudo mount -o loop"
2007-01-19T11:59:00.000Z	Tonren	christian1222	Note that the mount point must exist before you mount it
2007-01-19T11:59:00.000Z	christian1222	Tonren	i just did that
2007-01-19T12:00:00.000Z	christian1222	Tonren	thanks, i had one thing wrong, i was using the -t option with iso9660
2007-01-19T12:00:00.000Z	Tonren	christian1222	Ahh, ok.  That should work out for you then; the -o thing
2007-01-19T12:00:00.000Z	christian1222	Tonren	something I found online somewhere
2007-01-19T12:00:00.000Z	Tonren	christian1222	lol, that's the internet for you.
2007-01-19T12:00:00.000Z	christian1222	Tonren	what does that do? -0o loop
2007-01-19T12:01:00.000Z	Tonren	christian1222	I'm not entirely sure what it does.  I jus tknow that it mounts ISOs!  XD
2007-01-19T12:01:00.000Z	christian1222	Tonren	haha, if it works, dont screw with it!
2007-01-19T12:01:00.000Z	christian1222	Tonren	thanks again
2007-01-19T12:25:00.000Z	Tonren	christian1222	If it's too big, use rsync instead.  Even if it crashes, you can just run the same command again and it'll pick up where you left off.
2007-01-19T12:25:00.000Z	christian1222	Tonren	really, cool, thanks again!
2007-01-19T12:25:00.000Z	Tonren	christian1222	You're welcome!
2007-01-19T12:26:00.000Z	Tonren	christian1222	lebowski: Oh yeah, he has a good point.  rsync will act funny if you go ext3 --> fat32
2007-01-19T12:26:00.000Z	christian1222	Tonren	how do i check, its an external HD
