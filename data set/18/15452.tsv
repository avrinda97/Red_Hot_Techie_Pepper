2005-03-21T13:03:00.000Z	Razotter		uh, I wonder if anyone can help me. I got my ubuntu cds in the mail today, and when I boot off the live cd, all I get after the logo is a blank screen. I've never used linux before, so I'm a tad confused.
2005-03-21T13:04:00.000Z	Razotter		anyone?
2005-03-21T13:06:00.000Z	Razotter		unfortunately not.
2005-03-21T13:07:00.000Z	Razotter		I tried booting in a number of modes... failsafe and whatnot, but still the same. I tried a different set of disks and still the same. I can only guess its something about my hardware it doesn't like.
2005-03-21T13:07:00.000Z	Razotter		AMD 2000+xp, onboard Nvidia graphics card... *shrugs* I've tried just about everything to get it to work, and no luck. Just comes up after the progress bar with a black, blank screen.
2005-03-21T13:08:00.000Z	Myrtti	Razotter	what kind of screen do you have?
2005-03-21T13:08:00.000Z	Razotter		LG Studioworks 700S
2005-03-21T13:08:00.000Z	Myrtti		TFT. LCD, CRT?
2005-03-21T13:08:00.000Z	Razotter		Uh, I think CRT
2005-03-21T13:08:00.000Z	Myrtti	Razotter	big, heavy thing?
2005-03-21T13:08:00.000Z	Myrtti		not flat?
2005-03-21T13:08:00.000Z	Razotter		yup
2005-03-21T13:09:00.000Z	Myrtti		strange
2005-03-21T13:09:00.000Z	Myrtti		or perhaps not
2005-03-21T13:09:00.000Z	Razotter		The progress bar and logo display just fine... it just doesn't do anything further.
2005-03-21T13:09:00.000Z	Myrtti		refresh rates might have something to do with the issue
2005-03-21T13:09:00.000Z	Razotter		fully loads, then blanks out.
2005-03-21T13:10:00.000Z	Razotter	Myrtti	is there a way I can alter the refresh rate on booting? I know 50 and 60Hz should work.
