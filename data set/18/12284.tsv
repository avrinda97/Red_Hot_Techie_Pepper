2006-05-12T09:59:00.000Z	mz111	thug_	an ancient version
2006-05-12T09:59:00.000Z	thug_	mz111	heh
2006-05-12T10:17:00.000Z	mz111	thug_	xine, is generally easier to compile
2006-05-12T10:17:00.000Z	mz111	thug_	If you don't have xine, I would suggest getting it first, and then start playing with mplayer
2006-05-12T10:17:00.000Z	thug_	mz111	well i have already compiled mplayer and works fine ... i can play any file type ... now i just fond out that the version i compiled its old ;)
2006-05-12T10:18:00.000Z	thug_	mz111	compiling mplayer aint hard ... i just dont know if i will get it from cvs and compile it it will overwrite the old files or not
2006-05-12T10:18:00.000Z	mz111	thug_	so you wan't to upgrade, but have no reason other than your version is "old"
2006-05-12T10:18:00.000Z	thug_	mz111	not really
2006-05-12T10:19:00.000Z	thug_	mz111	i just join the #mplayer channel and read the topic PRE7 IS VERY OLD, use CVS CHECKOUT
2006-05-12T10:19:00.000Z	thug_	mz111	it says " very old " ;)) works really good here but ...it might be better to get the latest .. ?
2006-05-12T10:19:00.000Z	mz111	thug_	that is probably so then don't have to answer questions about old releases
2006-05-12T10:20:00.000Z	mz111	thug_	don't mess with a good thing, unless you are like me and don't know betteer
2006-05-12T10:20:00.000Z	thug_	mz111	well see thats what im afraid for ... i might dont get it working from cvs :)
2006-05-12T10:51:00.000Z	mz111	thug_	are you listening to a cd
2006-05-12T10:52:00.000Z	thug_	mz111	nope
2006-05-12T10:52:00.000Z	thug_	mz111	files from hdd
2006-05-12T10:52:00.000Z	mz111	thug_	what application?
2006-05-12T10:53:00.000Z	mz111	thug_	that would be my suggestion, but i don't have mplayer, so can't be of much more help
