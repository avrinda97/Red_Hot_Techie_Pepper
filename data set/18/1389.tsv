2011-05-02T06:59:00.000Z	KM0201	fisix	the icon for network manager/applet, is set by the theme.
2011-05-02T07:02:00.000Z	fisix	KM0201	sure, but it should change to the up/down arrow when i have an ethernet connection no?
2011-05-02T07:03:00.000Z	KM0201	fisix	again, it all depends on the theme...
2011-05-02T07:03:00.000Z	KM0201	fisix	what is it now, unplugged ethernet cable?
2011-05-02T07:04:00.000Z	fisix	KM0201	now it's the empty wireless wave
2011-05-02T07:05:00.000Z	KM0201	fisix	dunno man, does changing your theme change it?
