2005-07-12T06:29:00.000Z	Kyral		Not us, I assume
2005-07-12T06:29:00.000Z	Kyral		hmm, how would I rebuild my entire system from scratch?
2005-07-12T06:30:00.000Z	Kyral		Yea, well, mine compiled KDE and all its depends in about 1 day
2005-07-12T06:31:00.000Z	Kyral		back when I used Gentoo
2005-07-12T06:31:00.000Z	Kyral		so that also meant X :P
2005-07-12T06:32:00.000Z	Kyral		Gentoo is a whore
2005-07-12T06:32:00.000Z	Kyral		Seriously
2005-07-12T06:33:00.000Z	Kyral		to get where you get with a base Ubuntu Install, it would take you at LEAST 5 days
2005-07-12T06:35:00.000Z	Kyral		Like ME!
2005-07-12T06:36:00.000Z	Kyral		so how would I build everything from scratch again (might do this for when Breezy upgrades)
2005-07-12T06:37:00.000Z	Wyzard	Kyral	You don't need to recompile things from scratch for a dist-upgrade
2005-07-12T06:37:00.000Z	Kyral	Wyzard	what if I wanna compile the Upgrades from scratch?
2005-07-12T06:38:00.000Z	Wyzard	Kyral	Then you can use "apt-get source" and do so...  but that doesn't really have anything to do with upgrading
2005-07-12T06:38:00.000Z	Wyzard	Kyral	Go to www.debian.org and read the New Maintainer's Guide (unless Ubuntu has a similar but Ubuntu-specific document...  I'm mostly a Debian user so I don't know)
2005-07-12T06:39:00.000Z	Wyzard	Kyral	No, "apt-get source <packagename>" gets you the source package that the binary package (.deb) is built from
2005-07-12T06:39:00.000Z	Wyzard	Kyral	You can customize things and then build the binary package using debuild or something similar
2005-07-12T06:40:00.000Z	Wyzard	Kyral	There are some tools meant to help automate the process if you do it frequently, but I can' think of their names offhand
2005-07-12T06:41:00.000Z	Wyzard	Kyral	Recompiling packages isn't really related to upgrading though...  you compile some version of the package, and it doesn't matter whether or not you already have that version installed
