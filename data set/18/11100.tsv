2008-09-10T00:10:00.000Z	StevenX		Hello all. I am trying to modify my system. Is there a central area where I can change the icon used for a certain program so that that icon is used every else.
2008-09-10T00:10:00.000Z	StevenX		?
2008-09-10T00:12:00.000Z	Jowi	StevenX	/usr/share/applications/ there are some .desktop files in there that you can set the installed programs icons for etc
2008-09-10T00:12:00.000Z	StevenX	Jowi	thanks!
2008-09-10T00:12:00.000Z	Jowi	StevenX	your other option is to change it in the Icon theme you are using but it takes more work
2008-09-10T00:13:00.000Z	StevenX	Jowi	The 2nd option, do you mean installing an icon theme?
2008-09-10T00:15:00.000Z	Jowi	StevenX	each icon theme has it's own links for program icons. for example /usr/share/icons/gnome/48x48/apps has named icons that you can change. but you need to do that in each size directory which is not very hard to do but takes time and is annoying.
2008-09-10T00:15:00.000Z	StevenX	Jowi	I found the firefox in /usr/share/applications, I right-clicked and then properties, but I'm not sure how to change the icon it uses.
2008-09-10T00:16:00.000Z	Jowi	StevenX	it's a text file. you need to edit it, look for the icon name and change it and save it.
2008-09-10T00:16:00.000Z	StevenX	Jowi	thanks, will look into it.
2008-09-10T00:21:00.000Z	StevenX	Jowi	Let's say I have a file called browser_icon.png on my desktop, and that I've opened up the desktop configuration file for firefox in /usr/share/applications, what now?
2008-09-10T00:22:00.000Z	Jowi	StevenX	type in the full path to the icon you wish to use. Example: Icon=/home/StevenX/Desktop/browser_icon.png
2008-09-10T00:23:00.000Z	StevenX	Jowi	Thanks! Awesome.
2008-09-10T00:26:00.000Z	Jowi	StevenX	after the file is saved you might need to log off and log on again to see the change (firefox icon should now have changed in the gnome menues). if it isn't showing any icon you have a typo in the .desktop file.
2008-09-10T00:27:00.000Z	StevenX	Jowi	got it. Thanks. Can I create these .desktop files if I don't see one for a program I want?
2008-09-10T00:29:00.000Z	Jowi	StevenX	yes. you can. The only entries that are important is Exec=, Icon=, Name, GenericName and Type= and Categories= can be nice to have but are not needed.
2008-09-10T00:30:00.000Z	Jowi	StevenX	the three first i meant. the rest are optional.
2008-09-10T00:30:00.000Z	StevenX	Jowi	Thank you very much. I have changed a couple of icons. i will Log off and log back in to see what has occured. Thanks1
