2005-02-14T16:45:00.000Z	rose		does ubuntu partition the hard disc easily
2005-02-14T16:46:00.000Z	rose		perhaps I could say - for the newbie - is it easy to follow
2005-02-14T16:47:00.000Z	rose		I tried mandrake a couple years ago
2005-02-14T16:47:00.000Z	prego	rose	however I don't know if you can shrink existing partitions
2005-02-14T16:47:00.000Z	rose		do you use command line
2005-02-14T16:48:00.000Z	rose	prego	- at the mo I am running winXP with just whatever partition that has
2005-02-14T16:49:00.000Z	prego	rose	can you forget of your winXP (delete ALL of the HD data) ?
2005-02-14T16:49:00.000Z	prego	rose	and install it after?
2005-02-14T16:49:00.000Z	rose		I do get nervous with command line - but also see how powerful it can be
2005-02-14T16:49:00.000Z	rose		haven't instlle winXP - computer came preinstalled prego
2005-02-14T16:50:00.000Z	prego	rose	I agree with zeedo, AFAIK
2005-02-14T16:50:00.000Z	rose		zedo - hmm yes I think a friend did that for me some years ago on old system
2005-02-14T16:51:00.000Z	rose		okay prego - guess that means some more reading for me
2005-02-14T16:51:00.000Z	prego	rose	once the XP partition is resized, in ubuntu you can fill the rest of the HD with the partitions you wish
2005-02-14T16:51:00.000Z	rose		so - I would partition the hard drive then reinstall winXP and ubuntu
2005-02-14T16:52:00.000Z	prego	rose	on the other hand, if you have the XP CDs and license, ..., and you have not personal data on the HD, you can delete the partition at ubuntu and define it all
2005-02-14T16:52:00.000Z	rose		yeah I have photos and any other important stuff backed up
2005-02-14T16:53:00.000Z	prego	rose	check it twice before ;-)
