2009-07-08T00:16:00.000Z	scunizi	AceBlade159	I just came in so I missed a lot.. so you have sata drives?
2009-07-08T00:17:00.000Z	scunizi	AceBlade159	and are you attempting to do a dual boot?
2009-07-08T00:17:00.000Z	AceBlade159	scunizi	no, yuck
2009-07-08T00:18:00.000Z	scunizi	AceBlade159	ok :).. It wouldn't be a xfx motherboard or running the 8200 chipset would it?
2009-07-08T00:22:00.000Z	scunizi	AceBlade159	you could try this despite the MB or chipset type .. I had to use it on the live cd.. At the first screen seen on the live cd boot you can F6 to insert options.  As most say erase splash and quiet from the kernel line but that's only so you can see errors during the remaining boot process.. You can add pci=nomsi to the end of the kernel line like I had to.. It may work for you.. it may not.. If it does after install you'll hav
2009-07-08T00:27:00.000Z	scunizi	AceBlade159	may still work for you.. as well as noapic and nolapic.. see this post https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+question/51720  and this list of posts.. https://launchpad.net/+search?field.text=pci%3Dnomsi
2009-07-08T00:32:00.000Z	AceBlade159	scunizi	where do i enter that command
2009-07-08T00:32:00.000Z	scunizi	AceBlade159	on the primary boot screen (livecd) prior to trying to load the desktop.. push F6 and enter it at the end of the kernel line.
2009-07-08T00:39:00.000Z	AceBlade159	scunizi	where do i see the boot log
2009-07-08T00:41:00.000Z	AceBlade159	scunizi	it didn't work
2009-07-08T00:42:00.000Z	scunizi	AceBlade159	It was worth a shot.. sorry it didn't work..
2009-07-08T00:42:00.000Z	AceBlade159	scunizi	i'm trying to figure out what went wrong but i have no idea where the boot logs are, lol
2009-07-08T00:43:00.000Z	scunizi	AceBlade159	typically in /var/log.. also you can switch to a tty w/ ctrl+alt+F2 and type dmesg to see if there were any errors.
2009-07-08T00:48:00.000Z	AceBlade159	scunizi	i think i found the problem http://pastebin.ca/1487260
2009-07-08T00:49:00.000Z	AceBlade159	scunizi	mainly lines 7-24
2009-07-08T00:50:00.000Z	scunizi	AceBlade159	that certainly seems to point to it. I'd post the question to launchpad questions and see what response you get.. from there it can be moved to a "bug" status.. or just file a bug.
2009-07-08T00:50:00.000Z	AceBlade159	scunizi	alright thanks
2009-07-08T00:50:00.000Z	scunizi	AceBlade159	good luck!
