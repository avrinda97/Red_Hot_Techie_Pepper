2005-12-15T09:24:00.000Z	pete__	Subhuman	have you tried using webbrowser ssh ?
2005-12-15T09:24:00.000Z	Subhuman	pete__	like a java one yes, still no joy.
2005-12-15T09:24:00.000Z	pete__	Subhuman	oh, that sucks.
2005-12-15T09:25:00.000Z	Subhuman	pete__	 Ive tried alot of ways to get it working, as I dont like ftp, but the actual traffic itself is filtered.
2005-12-15T09:25:00.000Z	pete__	Subhuman	yea. they filter a secure protocol while leaving the (ftp) insecure protocol alive?
2005-12-15T09:26:00.000Z	Subhuman	pete__	 exactly its crazy, I think it's because you can tuneel traffic with ssh and they want to see what you are doing
2005-12-15T09:26:00.000Z	pete__	Subhuman	Probably.
2005-12-15T10:01:00.000Z	Subhuman	pete__	 you should scroll down and see web address with # before them
2005-12-15T10:02:00.000Z	Subhuman	pete__	well you jus need to type the extra reposories in directly
2005-12-15T10:06:00.000Z	Subhuman	pete__	 do a apt-get update to see the new lists.
2005-12-15T10:08:00.000Z	Subhuman	pete__	means another program is using the lists, you using synaptic at the same time?
2005-12-15T10:10:00.000Z	Subhuman	pete__	must mean another application (apt) is using it, you tried to restart to stop all programs and start fresh?
2005-12-15T10:10:00.000Z	Subhuman	pete__	 worth a shot id there still locked.
2005-12-15T10:13:00.000Z	Subhuman	pete__	 try a search in google for them
2005-12-15T10:14:00.000Z	pete__	Subhuman	i can't seem to find them
2005-12-15T10:16:00.000Z	Subhuman	pete__	the package you want is libstdc++5 i think
2005-12-15T10:18:00.000Z	Subhuman	pete__	 should be in apt, so sudo apt-get install libstdc++5 should do it.
2005-12-15T10:20:00.000Z	Subhuman	pete__	 what program is giving these errors?
