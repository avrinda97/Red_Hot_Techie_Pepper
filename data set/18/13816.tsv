2007-05-01T14:04:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	variant	Wait until morning and maybe we'll know more than that - for now, just hold your horses, b/c things may be very different from what people have said.
2007-05-01T14:04:00.000Z	variant	tonyyarusso	i see, don't really care tbh.. if dell goes with ubuntu then great but I hate all this garbage talk that always happens with things like this
