2011-03-05T01:10:00.000Z	cube1		guys, im about to give up. i have a directory, /home/artwork , and need to recursively find all files that end with 48.png, like blabla-48.png. just doing fine . -name "*48.png" doesnt work!
2011-03-05T01:12:00.000Z	schnuffle	cube1	find . -type f -iregex ".*48\.png"
2011-03-05T01:15:00.000Z	cube1	schnuffle	ikonia: i'm doing something like $ montage `find . -name '*48.png' -print` montage.png, but because i'm dumb i have files with characters like ' or - . how can i make find put a \ before them? or how can i make montage not get screwed up by them?
2011-03-05T01:19:00.000Z	schnuffle	cube1	did you try: montage "$(find . -name '*48.png' -print)" montage.png
2011-03-05T01:23:00.000Z	schnuffle	cube1	better use -print0
2011-03-05T01:23:00.000Z	cube1	schnuffle	whats the difference?
2011-03-05T01:25:00.000Z	schnuffle	cube1	special handling of newline, -print gives you a newline after each file name, don't think montage can handle that
2011-03-05T01:25:00.000Z	cube1	schnuffle	aaaaaah
2011-03-05T01:26:00.000Z	schnuffle	cube1	best is to look at the output of our find statement to see if it looks like you want before usinf it
2011-03-05T01:26:00.000Z	cube1	schnuffle	ye rite
2011-03-05T01:27:00.000Z	schnuffle	cube1	because finde normally escapes special characters by default if my memory doesn't trump me
2011-03-05T01:28:00.000Z	cube1	schnuffle	how does the ' and `, aka literal and non literal i think , work?
2011-03-05T01:44:00.000Z	schnuffle	cube1	did you try: montage "$(find . -name '*48.png' -printf  "\"%f\" ")" montage.png
2011-03-10T00:49:00.000Z	schnuffle	cube1	overheating?
2011-03-10T00:50:00.000Z	cube1	schnuffle	possibly, but how can i check? and prevent?

2011-03-10T00:53:00.000Z	schnuffle	cube1	 use sensors to see temperature
2011-03-10T00:55:00.000Z	cube1	schnuffle	yee, its always around 50°, while 85° is the critical. laptop doesnt feel even warm either.
