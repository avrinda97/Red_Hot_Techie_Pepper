2005-10-23T14:32:00.000Z	Mrl33t		how?  (sorry... im brand new to linux)
2005-10-23T14:32:00.000Z	bck_	Mrl33t	chmod +x file.bin
2005-10-23T14:32:00.000Z	bck_	Mrl33t	then ./file.bin
2005-10-23T14:36:00.000Z	bck_	Mrl33t	try "chmod +x thefilename.bin && ./thefilename.bin" this must work
2005-10-23T14:40:00.000Z	bck_	Mrl33t	why do you want to install realplayer? there are so much alternatives out there
2005-10-23T14:42:00.000Z	bck_	Mrl33t	typing realplayer?
2005-10-23T14:43:00.000Z	bck_	Mrl33t	or try typing "rea + TAB TAB"
2005-10-23T14:43:00.000Z	bck_	Mrl33t	i told you there are free alternatives
2005-10-23T14:46:00.000Z	bck_	Mrl33t	I admit you to read some of the linux fibles or start studying apt ;)
2005-10-23T14:48:00.000Z	bck_	Mrl33t	"sudo dpkg -i debfile"
2005-10-23T14:52:00.000Z	bck_	Mrl33t	then you are using apt at this very moment
2005-10-23T14:52:00.000Z	bck_	Mrl33t	you have to do one installation after another
2005-10-23T14:54:00.000Z	bck_	Mrl33t	i made good experiences playing mp3s with "xmms"
