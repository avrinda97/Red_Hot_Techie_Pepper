2005-09-30T07:53:00.000Z	Seveas	Hendric	chmod a+x,a-w /path/to/file
2005-09-30T07:56:00.000Z	Hendric	Seveas	i changed the file permission to 644.. i even changed the owner to root.. but still a normal user can delete it.. why is that?
2005-09-30T12:01:00.000Z	Seveas	Hendric	1.0.4 is unsafe
2005-09-30T12:02:00.000Z	Seveas	Hendric	then use windows...
2005-09-30T12:04:00.000Z	Hendric	Seveas	I wanna use linux... d only thing thats keeping me from playing online games is because i can't get mozilla activeX to work
2005-09-30T12:05:00.000Z	Seveas	Hendric	then get an updated activeX thing...
2005-10-13T14:27:00.000Z	Hendric	Seveas	cool. thanks.
2005-10-16T07:58:00.000Z	Hendric	Seveas	can i discuss a certain suspected BUG i experienced??? can be helpful maybe...
2005-10-17T15:12:00.000Z	Hendric	Seveas	i believe you.. messed up my firefox with unofficialguide.
2005-10-17T15:13:00.000Z	Seveas	Hendric	sudo -i is a shortcut for sudo -H -s :)
2005-10-17T15:15:00.000Z	Hendric	Seveas	i tried "sudo passwd root" then set the password.. i tried the passwd -l to make it normal... i can't get root anymore.. hows that?
2005-10-17T15:15:00.000Z	Seveas	Hendric	you can get a root shell with sudo -i
2005-10-17T15:16:00.000Z	Seveas	Hendric	sudo needs *your* password
2005-10-17T15:18:00.000Z	Seveas	Hendric	hehe sudo passwd will ask for a password 3 times: sudo asks once (your pass), passwd twice (the new pass for the user you change the password for)
2005-10-17T15:19:00.000Z	Hendric	Seveas	will the spca4xx bug get fixed on the final release???
2005-10-17T15:19:00.000Z	Seveas	Hendric	no clue, never heard of that bug
