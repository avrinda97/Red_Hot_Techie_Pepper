2007-09-04T07:50:00.000Z	whonicca		anyone know why a video card would work on one computer and not another, both support agp 2x/4x
2007-09-04T07:50:00.000Z	DjViper	whonicca	does one of them have onboard gfx ?
2007-09-04T07:51:00.000Z	whonicca	DjViper	no, neither do
2007-09-04T07:51:00.000Z	DjViper	whonicca	could be something wrong with one of the MB's then, or some IRQ conflict maybe, tho I doubt that the case
2007-09-04T07:51:00.000Z	whonicca	DjViper	yeah, i have to use this older video card on the computer that doesnt take the newer one
2007-09-04T07:52:00.000Z	DjViper	whonicca	does the card require external power?
2007-09-04T07:52:00.000Z	whonicca	DjViper	no, i just plug it into my other computer and it works
2007-09-04T07:52:00.000Z	whonicca		but on the p3 computer i just have a black screen
2007-09-04T07:52:00.000Z	DjViper	whonicca	yes, but there might be an internal 12v connector
2007-09-04T07:52:00.000Z	DjViper		oh.. p3
2007-09-04T07:52:00.000Z	DjViper		nevermind

2007-09-04T07:53:00.000Z	DjViper	whonicca	hmm okay
2007-09-04T07:53:00.000Z	whonicca	DjViper	could it be the power supply?
