2007-04-20T07:26:00.000Z	Pelo	CheesyJedi	 remoe totem-mozilla it interfeers
2007-04-20T07:27:00.000Z	CheesyJedi	Pelo	I did
2007-04-20T07:27:00.000Z	CheesyJedi	Pelo	it didn't help
2007-04-20T07:27:00.000Z	Pelo	CheesyJedi	 do you have the codecs installed ?
2007-04-20T07:27:00.000Z	CheesyJedi	Pelo	I think so, but how do I check?
2007-04-20T07:33:00.000Z	CheesyJedi	Pelo	you know what, scratch that. Is there an easy way to get the VLC plugin for firefox working? (That already has all the plugins built in). synaptic says that it's installed, so how do I enable it?
2007-04-20T07:33:00.000Z	Pelo	CheesyJedi	 try removing the other players-mozilla plugins and leaving only the vlc one
2007-04-20T07:34:00.000Z	CheesyJedi	Pelo	ok, I'm doing that now
2007-04-20T07:36:00.000Z	CheesyJedi	Pelo	I uninstalled all plugins except for vlc and when I reloaded the page with a quicktime movie, firefox crashed
2007-04-20T07:43:00.000Z	Pelo	CheesyJedi	 lovely ;-),  I don'T know if  vlc supports quicktime but whatever,    what version of ubu are you running ?
2007-04-20T07:43:00.000Z	CheesyJedi	Pelo	Edgy still. Havn't gotten round to upgrading yet
2007-04-20T07:43:00.000Z	Pelo	CheesyJedi	  chouldn'T be that hard in edgy,  remove mplayer, remove vlc,  the pluggins will be removed as well,  then install the mplayer-mozilla pluggin
2007-04-20T07:43:00.000Z	CheesyJedi	Pelo	btw, I have a question about that. when I upgrade to edgy, is it going to need a complete new install or does it retain the files and just update the appropriate files?
2007-04-20T07:43:00.000Z	CheesyJedi	Pelo	*Upgrade to feisty
2007-04-20T07:43:00.000Z	Pelo	CheesyJedi	  it will intall a bunch of new packages, remove a bunch, but your settings customixing and data should remain
2007-04-20T07:43:00.000Z	CheesyJedi	Pelo	great, thanks
