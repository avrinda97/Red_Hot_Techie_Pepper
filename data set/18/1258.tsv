2011-05-18T22:27:00.000Z	Dazzled		my PC detects 2 screens, however, there's only 1 attached
2011-05-18T22:27:00.000Z	Dazzled		it also thinks one is a laptop, while in fact there's only one, and it's a TV
2011-05-18T22:28:00.000Z	Dazzled		I'm on 11.04; in 10.10 this worked fine
2011-05-18T22:30:00.000Z	Dazzled		is there a way to "reset" the screen driver?
2011-05-18T22:31:00.000Z	LAcan	Dazzled	whats the problem?
2011-05-18T22:31:00.000Z	Dazzled	LAcan	I have a box connected to a TV, but the resolution is wrong
2011-05-18T22:31:00.000Z	Dazzled		and when I try to change it, there are 2 screens in the window, while in fact there is only 1 attached
2011-05-18T22:32:00.000Z	LAcan	Dazzled	i dont understand 2 screeens in the window?
2011-05-18T22:32:00.000Z	Dazzled		and none of the resolution fit the tv (should be 1360x...) but the max I can pick is 1024x768
2011-05-18T22:32:00.000Z	Dazzled		Ubuntu detects 2 displays
2011-05-18T22:32:00.000Z	Dazzled		but there is only 1 connected
2011-05-18T22:32:00.000Z	Dazzled		one it calls "Laptop" and one it calls "Unknown"
2011-05-18T22:33:00.000Z	LAcan	Dazzled	ya that seems like proper behaviour.. the TV is "unknown"
2011-05-18T22:33:00.000Z	Dazzled		but there is no laptop :s
2011-05-18T22:33:00.000Z	Dazzled		the TV is the main monitor
2011-05-18T22:33:00.000Z	Dazzled		(there shouldn't be 2 displays detected)
2011-05-18T22:34:00.000Z	LAcan	Dazzled	ok... i dont use dual head setups so... im gonna have to pass on this one... 11.04 is known to be buggy with 2 screens fyi
2011-05-18T22:34:00.000Z	Dazzled	LAcan	sorry, I'm confusing you I think
