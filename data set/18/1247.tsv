2011-04-21T17:00:00.000Z	m1aris		I have a connection problem. 'Device not managed'.
2011-04-21T17:01:00.000Z	erUSUL	m1aris	which device?
2011-04-21T17:01:00.000Z	m1aris		eth0, my adsl connection
2011-04-21T17:02:00.000Z	erUSUL	m1aris	does « grep "eth0" /etc/network/interfaces » give any output?
2011-04-21T17:02:00.000Z	m1aris		It's listed. address, broadcast and mask.
2011-04-21T17:03:00.000Z	erUSUL	m1aris	if you use  /etc/network/interfaces then network manager will not manage it
2011-04-21T17:03:00.000Z	m1aris	erUSUL	i don't understand much, must i type that on terminal?
2011-04-21T17:04:00.000Z	erUSUL	m1aris	they are two mutually exclusive methods or managing network connections
2011-04-21T17:04:00.000Z	erUSUL	m1aris	yes
2011-04-21T17:05:00.000Z	m1aris	erUSUL	I had the networkmanager, but now displays that message.
2011-04-21T17:06:00.000Z	m1aris	erUSUL	The ouput is auto eth0, iface eth0 inet static
2011-04-21T17:06:00.000Z	erUSUL	m1aris	the command i gave you give some output? (yes/no)
2011-04-21T17:06:00.000Z	erUSUL	m1aris	ok so it is yes.
2011-04-21T17:06:00.000Z	erUSUL	m1aris	if you use  /etc/network/interfaces then network manager will not manage it they are two mutually exclusive methods or managing network connections
2011-04-21T17:07:00.000Z	erUSUL	m1aris	you can not use both
2011-04-21T17:08:00.000Z	m1aris	erUSUL	It's like use one manager. What happened, i downloaded another manager and messed up my connection. How do i fix that now?
2011-04-21T17:09:00.000Z	erUSUL	m1aris	if you want to use Network manager just remove the lines that configure eth0 from /etc/network/interfaces
2011-04-21T17:15:00.000Z	m1aris	erUSUL	That is fixed now. Many thanx. There is a way to manually add a static address instead of DHCP. I prefer that, but how do i do that?
