2007-08-25T15:03:00.000Z	Jordan_U	unknown__	have you tried bcm43xx-fwcutter?
2007-08-25T15:04:00.000Z	unknown__	Jordan_U	bcm43xx-fwcutter gets errors
2007-08-25T15:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	unknown__	Ahh, probably md5 mismatch again, I have the firmware that it installs on my site, you can just copy it to /lib/firmware ...
2007-08-25T15:06:00.000Z	unknown__	Jordan_U	md5? what's that?
2007-08-25T15:07:00.000Z	Jordan_U	unknown__	It is a way of checking file integrity, basically the place where the package downloads the firmware changed and the package hasn't been updated
2007-08-25T15:08:00.000Z	Jordan_U	unknown__	Here is the .zip file, extract it to your desktop http://trogdoor.googlepages.com/firmware.zip
2007-08-25T15:10:00.000Z	Jordan_U	unknown__	Tell me once you have the firmware in a folder named "firmware" on your desktop
2007-08-25T15:10:00.000Z	unknown__	Jordan_U	kk got it
2007-08-25T15:11:00.000Z	unknown__	Jordan_U	I have the "firmware"
2007-08-25T15:12:00.000Z	Jordan_U	unknown__	Ok, now run " sudo mv ~/Dektop/firmware/*.fw /lib/firmware"
2007-08-25T15:13:00.000Z	Jordan_U	unknown__	Change "Dektop" to "Desktop" :)
2007-08-25T15:15:00.000Z	unknown__	Jordan_U	done no return error
2007-08-25T15:15:00.000Z	Jordan_U	unknown__	Now, for security, run "sudo chown root:root /lib/firmware/*.fw"
2007-08-25T15:16:00.000Z	unknown__	Jordan_U	 Also done. No return error
2007-08-25T15:17:00.000Z	unknown__	Jordan_U	 Man I gotta say none of this was in any forums
2007-08-25T15:17:00.000Z	Jordan_U	unknown__	Ok, now reboot and your wireless should work ( the reboot isn't needed but I forget how to restart network-manager :)
2007-08-25T15:18:00.000Z	Jordan_U	unknown__	That is because usually you just install bcm43xx-fwcutter and it does all this for you
2007-08-25T15:18:00.000Z	unknown__	Jordan_U	 Thanks again I'll try rebooting my computer now
