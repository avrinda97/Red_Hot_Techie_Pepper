2005-05-22T10:51:00.000Z	fsapo		hi all, anybody could help me with a video problem?
2005-05-22T10:52:00.000Z	fsapo		my videos are looking strange in totem.. its like sharpening the borders
2005-05-22T10:52:00.000Z	fsapo		in mplayer its smooth, but its crashing with ac3 sound -_-
2005-05-22T10:52:00.000Z	fsapo		is there some kind of anti-aliasing feature or option in totem-xine?
2005-05-22T10:54:00.000Z	antix	fsapo	I get the best results in xine. I followed instructions in www.ubuntuguide.org
2005-05-22T10:55:00.000Z	fsapo	antix	but my video is looking strange in xine, the subtitles border for example arent looking smooth
2005-05-22T10:57:00.000Z	antix	fsapo	ok thought you said you were using totem
2005-05-22T10:57:00.000Z	fsapo	antix	i m using totem, but totem uses xine
2005-05-22T10:57:00.000Z	antix	fsapo	ok :)
2005-05-22T10:59:00.000Z	fsapo	antix	hybrid_goth, i m uploading the screenshots
2005-05-22T11:01:00.000Z	fsapo	antix	hybrid_goth, this one is with MPlayer, look how the subtitles are smooth http://img184.echo.cx/img184/5523/screenshot2mg.png
2005-05-22T11:02:00.000Z	fsapo	antix	hybrid_goth, now this one is with xine http://img177.echo.cx/img177/428/screenshot11lz.png
2005-05-22T11:05:00.000Z	antix	fsapo	are the subtitles added from a text file?
2005-05-22T11:05:00.000Z	fsapo	antix	no
2005-05-22T11:05:00.000Z	fsapo	antix	the video itself is crisp
2005-05-22T11:05:00.000Z	fsapo	antix	but you can see it better in the subtitles
2005-05-22T11:06:00.000Z	antix	fsapo	I like the crisp one better :)
2005-05-22T11:06:00.000Z	fsapo	antix	=/ but i want it smoother :P
