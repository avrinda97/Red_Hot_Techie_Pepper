2005-12-01T12:09:00.000Z	ale3hs_		please someone, I have problem with my sound card, and I dont know how to fix it
2005-12-01T12:11:00.000Z	psychocat	ale3hs_	why did you change it?
2005-12-01T12:12:00.000Z	ale3hs_	psychocat	coz I could play to videos 2gether and to have sound in both
2005-12-01T12:13:00.000Z	psychocat	ale3hs_	you could also try the alsa wrapper for OSS , might work for that
2005-12-01T12:14:00.000Z	ale3hs_	psychocat	: alsa wrapper 4 OSS ??
2005-12-01T12:15:00.000Z	ale3hs_	psychocat	how can i sent something to my sound device ?? to check if it works?
2005-12-01T12:16:00.000Z	psychocat	ale3hs_	you could go to system -> preferences -> sound and play a sound
2005-12-01T12:17:00.000Z	ale3hs_	psychocat	it doesnt see my sound card
2005-12-01T12:22:00.000Z	psychocat	ale3hs_	try this on a console and see what you get: alsamixer -c 0
2005-12-01T12:23:00.000Z	ale3hs_	psychocat	alsamixer: function snd_ctl_open failed for hw:0: No such file or directory

2005-12-01T12:25:00.000Z	ale3hs_	psychocat	no, but there is any room in freenode that they deal with sound problems?? u know.. with alsa etc
2005-12-01T12:25:00.000Z	psychocat	ale3hs_	i don't know, sorry :(
2005-12-01T12:27:00.000Z	ale3hs_	psychocat	ubuntu has any hardware detector to check if it can see my sound card ?? it is integrated u know
