2011-08-01T09:46:00.000Z	ubernerd	HackNewton	I can tell you why. Its formatted ExFat, which is a format not supported natively in linux
2011-08-01T09:46:00.000Z	HackNewton	ubernerd	so what should i do it ? format it in NTFS ?
2011-08-01T09:46:00.000Z	ubernerd	HackNewton	That'd be advisable I guess :D
2011-08-01T09:47:00.000Z	HackNewton	ubernerd	well i have bad experince converting FAT to NTFS drive for Pen Drive
2011-08-01T09:47:00.000Z	ubernerd	HackNewton	Just back up all your data you should be fine
2011-08-01T09:48:00.000Z	ubernerd	HackNewton	Format it in Windows, select NTFS
2011-08-01T09:48:00.000Z	ubernerd	HackNewton	you can do so by going into my computer, right clicking the drive, and click format
2011-08-01T09:49:00.000Z	HackNewton	ubernerd	thanks i will try
2011-08-01T09:49:00.000Z	ubernerd	HackNewton	Make sure to back up data on it
