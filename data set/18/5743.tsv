2008-08-28T23:34:00.000Z	gaintsura		I've been working now for 4 days trying to get my video to go back to 'better'.. my current xorg.conf is here http://pastebin.com/m3e5a40df I cannot get full screen video, period. if I try, all I get is a flash of the full screen video and it returns to windowed mode (this is all on streaming video), when I try to watch a .flv locally from the desktop it is very lagged and choppy. Again, 4 days and I haven't even managed to move 1 inch
