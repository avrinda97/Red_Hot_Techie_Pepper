2007-10-14T05:26:00.000Z	kiru		when will 7.10 be released?
2007-10-14T05:27:00.000Z	jrib	kiru	~18th
2007-10-14T05:28:00.000Z	jrib	kiru	try to keep the discussion related to ubuntu support
2007-10-14T05:29:00.000Z	jrib	kiru	#ubuntu-offtopic, not here please
2008-11-20T17:59:00.000Z	jrib	kiru	why would you run apt-get dist-upgrade to upgrade from feisty to gutsy?
2008-11-20T18:01:00.000Z	jrib	kiru	yes, as bazhang said it would be better to get a recent release and just install that.  But in the future when you upgrade, don't use apt-get dist-upgrade, use the instructions ubottu gave
2008-11-20T18:01:00.000Z	jrib	kiru	find a friend that can burn you a cd or try:
2008-11-20T18:01:00.000Z	jrib	kiru	what is that?
2008-11-20T18:03:00.000Z	kiru	jrib	i dont have the possibility to get an 8.10 cd
2008-11-20T18:03:00.000Z	jrib	kiru	did you read what ubottu sent you?  There are other ways to install
2008-11-20T18:03:00.000Z	kiru	jrib	of course
2008-11-20T18:04:00.000Z	jrib	kiru	it makes a lot more sense to do that rather than isntalling an old, unsupported version
2008-11-20T18:04:00.000Z	jrib	kiru	you're ignoring what I told you.  That's not how you upgrade anyway.
2008-11-20T18:05:00.000Z	kiru	jrib	i dont wanna argue with you
2008-11-20T18:07:00.000Z	jrib	kiru	then *listen*.  1) Your best course of action is to get a current cd.  Ask a friend or find a local linux user group or ubuntu loco that can help you.  2) Use an alternative install method that does not require you to burn a cd. 3) if 1 and 2 are impossible then upgrade properly as the link ubottu gave you explains
2008-11-20T18:08:00.000Z	kiru	jrib	ok, sorry for disturbing
2008-11-20T18:11:00.000Z	jrib	kiru	you're not disturbing.  No need to apologize
2008-12-06T21:32:00.000Z	jrib	kiru	extract the first one
