2008-03-19T03:24:00.000Z	mj		Sorry to keep spamming, but does anyone know how to mess around with display settings in Ubuntu?
2008-03-19T03:24:00.000Z	Ward1983	mj	what kind of display settings?
2008-03-19T03:25:00.000Z	Ward1983	mj	/etc/X!!/xorg.conf ! :)
2008-03-19T03:25:00.000Z	Ward1983	mj	so its /etc/X11/xorg.conf i made a type
2008-03-19T03:27:00.000Z	Ward1983	mj	you need to check for TV out settings for your card, you can probably google them, and then try them, but ALLWAYS backup your original xorg.conf first, so you can replace it using the CLI, the graphics wont work with wrong xorg settings :)
2008-03-19T03:29:00.000Z	Ward1983	mj	make a backup and make sure you can replace and copy files using the CLI (a terminal)
2008-03-19T03:29:00.000Z	Ward1983	mj	so if it goes wrong you can put the backup back
2008-03-19T03:30:00.000Z	Ward1983	mj	if it goes wrong ubuntu will boot into CLI (command line interface)
2008-03-19T03:30:00.000Z	Ward1983	mj	still even then you can pop in the live cd and use it to replace your xorg with the backup or your original one
2008-03-19T03:30:00.000Z	Ward1983	mj	but that will only take longer
2008-03-19T03:31:00.000Z	Ward1983	mj	but look for a good TV out tutorial to read so you have a good idea what you're up against
2008-03-19T03:32:00.000Z	Ward1983	mj	correct
2008-03-19T03:32:00.000Z	Ward1983	mj	live cd will work too if youre unsure with CLI
2008-03-19T03:33:00.000Z	Ward1983	mj	(by that i mean the way you probably installed ubuntu)
2008-03-19T03:34:00.000Z	Ward1983	mj	cant help you with the settings though, never had a ATI myself
2008-03-19T03:34:00.000Z	Ward1983	mj	no prob, good luck
2008-03-19T03:52:00.000Z	Ward1983	mj	you just need to read the guide he gave you several times
2008-03-19T03:55:00.000Z	Ward1983	mj	no problem, good luck
