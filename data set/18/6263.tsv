2008-06-07T05:55:00.000Z	eraldo		in nautilus... when rightclicking a file, there is a "Notes"-tab.. Question: is there a way to view or right content to that tab using the command line ?
2008-06-07T05:56:00.000Z	Bodsda	eraldo	i see no such tab
2008-06-07T06:01:00.000Z	Bodsda	eraldo	you add things by typing in the big white space on that tab
2008-06-07T06:02:00.000Z	eraldo	Bodsda	-.- sure but how can I look at or edit text like this with the command line
2008-06-07T06:02:00.000Z	Bodsda	eraldo	do you mean, how to add text to the note section of a file? no idea
2008-06-07T06:03:00.000Z	eraldo	Bodsda	yep that is what I am looking for
2008-06-07T06:03:00.000Z	eraldo	Bodsda	it has to be saved somewhere...

2008-06-07T06:06:00.000Z	Bodsda	eraldo	they are stored here -- ~/.nautilus/metafiles/file:*
