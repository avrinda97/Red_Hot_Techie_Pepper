2006-08-13T08:25:00.000Z	`Capo`		efax-gtk
2006-08-13T08:25:00.000Z	`Capo`		i need to fax microsoft documents , but first i have to convert them to postscript
2006-08-13T08:26:00.000Z	MrRio	`Capo`	open them in openoffice, that will convert to pdf, or you can use the print dialog to output as plain old postscript
2006-08-13T08:27:00.000Z	`Capo`	MrRio	i can convert them to pdf in openoffice, but i need them in .ps format
2006-08-13T08:27:00.000Z	`Capo`	MrRio	before i can fax them with efax
2006-08-13T08:27:00.000Z	MrRio	`Capo`	as i said, the print dialog can 'print' to a file, thats just plain postscript
2006-08-13T08:28:00.000Z	`Capo`	MrRio	oh i see, cool thanks
2006-08-13T08:28:00.000Z	MrRio	`Capo`	set 'Location' to 'File'
2006-08-13T08:31:00.000Z	`Capo`	MrRio	that worked great, thanks, i did a test fax just to make sure
2006-08-13T08:31:00.000Z	MrRio	`Capo`	No problem :)
