2009-06-07T09:40:00.000Z	trans		hmm... i can't seem to change user config using the Users and Groups applet.  It's locked and most options are disabled
2009-06-07T09:41:00.000Z	trans		even sudo users-admin doesn't unlock it, the options are still disabled
2009-06-07T09:42:00.000Z	fccf	trans	no unlock button? try sudo su ... then users-admin
2009-06-07T09:42:00.000Z	trans	fccf	the unlock button is there but it's disabled =P
2009-06-07T09:42:00.000Z	fccf	trans	is your user in the sudoers list
2009-06-07T09:43:00.000Z	trans	fccf	yes i can sudo, and sudo su first didn't open the window at all (couldn't open display)
2009-06-07T10:03:00.000Z	fccf	trans	I am using VNC right now ... on a windws machine connected to an ubuntu server - I don't seem to have that prob lem
2009-06-07T10:06:00.000Z	trans	fccf	maybe ubuntu-server has better default settings =P
2009-06-07T10:07:00.000Z	fccf	trans	perhaps - yet i am running a full desktop
2009-06-07T10:08:00.000Z	fccf	trans	are you using a vncserver you installed or are you using the one that comes by default with ubuntu?
2009-06-07T10:09:00.000Z	trans	fccf	i'm using vnc4server
2009-06-07T10:12:00.000Z	fccf	trans	that might be why .. I am running vino
2009-06-07T10:12:00.000Z	fccf	trans	which is default in gnome/ubuntu
2009-06-07T10:13:00.000Z	trans	fccf	vino also uses the real desktop right?  vncserver makes a unique desktop only accessible through vnc (it responds faster than vino)
2009-06-07T10:13:00.000Z	fccf	trans	well I like to come back to my desktop the way I left it
2009-06-07T10:15:00.000Z	trans	fccf	hehe yeah this computer is headless.  I have a desktop with 3 monitors and have one monitor dedicated to a vnc session to this computer (but i can also put windows overtop of it and copy and paste easily between the computers) =)
2009-06-07T10:16:00.000Z	fccf	trans	you might consider x2vnc - allows you to use 1 kb across multiple machines/heads
2009-06-07T10:18:00.000Z	trans	fccf	kinda like synergy? yeah i think i prefer to be able to use all 3 monitors if i want with then one computer =)  thanks anyways though
