2007-08-06T15:25:00.000Z	jamesdell		!obex
2007-08-06T15:26:00.000Z	savvas	jamesdell	try: apt-cache search obex
2007-08-06T15:27:00.000Z	jamesdell	savvas	sorry obexserver
2007-08-06T15:27:00.000Z	jamesdell	savvas	I did that but no results
2007-08-06T15:28:00.000Z	savvas	jamesdell	i have results, you might haven't enabled universe repositories, from the menu: system > administration > software sources> check everything under "downloadable from the internet"
2007-08-06T15:30:00.000Z	jamesdell	savvas	my option "community-maintained open source software (universe)" is already enabled...
2007-08-06T15:31:00.000Z	savvas	jamesdell	I tried "obex" and got results, maybe it's not an obexserver package, or maybe it's not included :)
2007-08-06T15:31:00.000Z	savvas	jamesdell	if it's the latter case, then you'll have to google your way to find it
2007-08-06T15:31:00.000Z	jamesdell	savvas	that is what im doing now :)
2007-08-06T15:32:00.000Z	jamesdell	savvas	i think google still doesnt gimme links :(
2007-08-06T15:34:00.000Z	savvas	jamesdell	why do you need obexserver? which program requires that package?
2007-08-06T15:35:00.000Z	jamesdell	savvas	for bluetooth. i want to transfer my files in nokia phone going to pc.. and this link hits me attention to follow-in.. http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=34740
2007-08-06T15:37:00.000Z	savvas	jamesdell	go to menu: applications > add/remove > type "bluetooth", wait for some seconds and check the obex program there to download it
2007-08-06T15:37:00.000Z	savvas	jamesdell	it's the 5th one in my list
2007-08-06T15:40:00.000Z	jamesdell	savvas	thanks :)
