2006-03-05T15:47:00.000Z	CNKRTDSKO		sweet. ok well first off. im downloading the install iso, i got the live cd first, but that isnt what i wanted. anyways, im wondering when i go to install it will it remove my windows? (that is what i want)
2006-03-05T15:48:00.000Z	CNKRTDSKO		ok cool, and when im removing windows, do i have the option to move some folder around? like documents and mp3's?
2006-03-05T15:49:00.000Z	CNKRTDSKO		ok, so i should back up my inportant things then...and once it is done installing, when i turn on my pc, it will boot straight into ubuntu right?
2006-03-05T15:50:00.000Z	CNKRTDSKO		ok sweet :)
2006-03-05T15:50:00.000Z	CNKRTDSKO		now, are there any themes and stuff....kind of like windowsblinds?
2006-03-05T15:50:00.000Z	CNKRTDSKO		gnome?
2006-03-05T15:50:00.000Z	CNKRTDSKO		lol
2006-03-05T15:51:00.000Z	CNKRTDSKO		cool, and ubuntu comes with the nessecary things like firefox and a media player and a chat (IM) program right?
2006-03-05T15:51:00.000Z	CNKRTDSKO		oh man. i love it.
2006-03-05T15:52:00.000Z	CNKRTDSKO		oh yeah. my main concern with all this is, i am using a wireless router, the actual modem is upstairs...and i have been told that ubuntu wont read my driver disks and stuff..so how am i to get on the internet? like how do i configure my router?
2006-03-05T15:52:00.000Z	variant	CNKRTDSKO	you will need ot install the codecs etc but thats an easy menu option
2006-03-05T15:53:00.000Z	variant	CNKRTDSKO	for most videos and music
2006-03-05T15:53:00.000Z	variant	CNKRTDSKO	you will just use dhcp to connect to the router..
2006-03-05T15:54:00.000Z	variant	CNKRTDSKO	no driver needed unless you connect the modem directly to the ubuntu box
2006-03-05T15:54:00.000Z	variant	CNKRTDSKO	what wireless card do you have in the ubuntu box?
2006-03-05T15:55:00.000Z	variant	CNKRTDSKO	you are connecting the router to the ubuntu box with usb?
2006-03-05T15:55:00.000Z	variant	CNKRTDSKO	then you might need a driver... what router model is it?
2006-03-05T15:58:00.000Z	variant	CNKRTDSKO	might be a problem, if you can connect it with ethernet then it will work fine
