2007-03-31T06:00:00.000Z	LjL	thcmonkey	 apt-cache search dvb 
2007-03-31T06:01:00.000Z	LjL	thcmonkey	assuming you're using a sat tv card, that is
2007-03-31T06:01:00.000Z	LjL	thcmonkey	unsure... i'd guess about 70, but maybe less
2007-03-31T06:02:00.000Z	LjL	thcmonkey	check out linuxtv.org for linux compatibility of TV cards
2007-03-31T06:03:00.000Z	LjL	thcmonkey	there used to be all-in-one graphics+tv cards, but yeah, right now they're mostly separate PCI cards or USB cards
2007-03-31T06:04:00.000Z	LjL	thcmonkey	at least, the terrestrial tv ones are very popular on USB as well, maybe for sat PCI is the only real choice
2007-03-31T06:04:00.000Z	LjL	thcmonkey	are you in europe or in the US? i mentioned DVB, but i'm not sure if US satellites use DVB-S as well as the one we point to in europe (though i think they do)
2007-03-31T06:06:00.000Z	thcmonkey	LjL	im in the uk
2007-03-31T06:07:00.000Z	LjL	thcmonkey	DVB it is then
2007-03-31T06:07:00.000Z	thcmonkey	LjL	do you have something similar setup
2007-03-31T06:08:00.000Z	LjL	thcmonkey	not really, but since i recently bought a (crappy) DVB-T (i.e. terrestrial digital) USB card, i informed myself a little
2007-03-31T06:09:00.000Z	LjL	thcmonkey	i payed the terrestrial card 29, for the record. though i suppose satellite cards are a bit more specialized... given my (not very good) experience, though, i wouldn't aim to the *very* budget ones
2007-03-31T06:10:00.000Z	thcmonkey	LjL	out of curiosity, where do you live?
2007-03-31T06:10:00.000Z	LjL	thcmonkey	italy
2007-03-31T06:23:00.000Z	thcmonkey	LjL	what sort of connectors am i gonna need from satellite box to tv card?
2007-03-31T06:24:00.000Z	LjL	thcmonkey	just the normal antenna cable, i think...
2007-03-31T06:27:00.000Z	LjL	thcmonkey	peep at Hauppage's site, i think their cards are on average the ones best supported on Ubuntu (i'm thinking mostly of terrestrial TV, but i suppose they've got satellite too)
