2008-11-25T20:07:00.000Z	schmrz		Hi all. What is the initrd image file in Ubuntu 8.10?
2008-11-25T20:07:00.000Z	erUSUL	schmrz	/boot/initrd.img-*
2008-11-25T20:07:00.000Z	schmrz	erUSUL	no, not there
2008-11-25T20:08:00.000Z	erUSUL	schmrz	yes they are there. maybe you can elaborate on the question or problem you are trying to solve
2008-11-25T20:09:00.000Z	schmrz	erUSUL	 i have /boot/abi-*, /boot/config-*, /boot/memtest*, /boot/system.map-*, /boot/vmlinuz-*, /boot/vmcoreinfo-*
2008-11-25T20:10:00.000Z	erUSUL	schmrz	that is really weird... maybe you deleted them by mistake?
2008-11-25T20:10:00.000Z	schmrz	erUSUL	i installed 8.10 twice. both times it didn't install grub automaticly. so i installed it manualy but it can't boot without the initrd property
2008-11-25T20:11:00.000Z	erUSUL	schmrz	try sudo update-initramfs
2008-11-25T20:11:00.000Z	schmrz	erUSUL	it's generating it...
2008-11-25T20:12:00.000Z	erUSUL	schmrz	it is weird that installed the kernel debs did not triguered the initrd generation....
