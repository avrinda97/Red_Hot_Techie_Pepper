2012-05-09T16:28:00.000Z	BrianNie		I am come back. I tried reinstall the driver for VGA.But there are many problems.
2012-05-09T16:29:00.000Z	BrianNie		The driver AMD supported for my computer can not install on ubuntu 12.04
2012-05-09T16:29:00.000Z	dlentz	BrianNie	what version of the AMD driver?
2012-05-09T16:31:00.000Z	BrianNie		My computer is DELL inspiron 1526 and the VGA card is X1200. The card is not supported in the new driver.
2012-05-09T16:32:00.000Z	dlentz	BrianNie	you don't need the proprietary AMD driver, open-source default driver works fine
2012-05-09T16:33:00.000Z	BrianNie		Then I uninstalled the driver from ATI , reboot the computer. It worked.
2012-05-09T16:34:00.000Z	BrianNie		But now , It can work only 2D
2012-05-09T16:35:00.000Z	BrianNie		yes, I think it maybe the unity problem.
2012-05-09T16:36:00.000Z	dlentz	BrianNie	have you looked at /var/log/Xorg.0.log (pastebin it)?
2012-05-09T16:37:00.000Z	BrianNie	dlentz	let me see
2012-05-09T16:41:00.000Z	BrianNie	dlentz	where can I paste the Xorg.0.log file?
2012-05-09T16:42:00.000Z	BrianNie		I saw many output like [   327.023] (EE) FBDEV(0): FBIOPUTCMAP: Invalid argument
2012-05-09T16:54:00.000Z	BrianNie		DarwinSurivor, I pasted the Xorg file at http://paste.ubuntu.com/977809/
2012-05-09T16:55:00.000Z	dlentz	BrianNie	(EE) Failed to load module "ati" (module does not exist, 0)
2012-05-09T16:56:00.000Z	BrianNie	dlentz	yes I saw it. But there is no any ati driver I can install
2012-05-09T16:56:00.000Z	dlentz		you're missing the ati driver, make sure xserver-xorg-video-ati package is installed
2012-05-09T16:56:00.000Z	BrianNie		let me try
2012-05-09T17:00:00.000Z	BrianNie	dlentz	I installed radeon and ati package.I need reboot and make it take effect. Thank you, I will try
