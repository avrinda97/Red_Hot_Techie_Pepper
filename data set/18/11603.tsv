2006-08-10T13:18:00.000Z	Eclypse		Can anyone help me get my ATI Drivers working perfectly?? Please do NOT send me to a guide. I need step by step help with this because it appears to be alot more complex then the 6 threads I read.

2006-08-10T13:20:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Eclypse	that's what a guide is, step by step instructions. Did you read the wiki or some forum?
2006-08-10T13:20:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Eclypse	I have a ATI x300 64MB on my laptop -- works perfectly with ati drivers.
2006-08-10T13:21:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Eclypse	you have the exact same card as I do, and it works fine. So guess you need to upgrade your reading skills.
2006-08-10T13:22:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Eclypse	I used the wiki. Have you read it? What is not working? What errors do you get?
2006-08-10T13:22:00.000Z	Eclypse	fyrestrtr	when I type fglrxinfo its showing mesa. also I don't think there is any direct rendering for the desktop, it appears to be using the CPU even when the video drivers ARE working. I remember I got it working before but it required alot of help and hours of work.
2006-08-10T13:23:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Eclypse	are you using xgl?
2006-08-10T13:23:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Eclypse	if flgrxinfo shows mesa, then you are not using the accelerated drivers. First, follow the wiki, then come back here.
2006-08-10T13:23:00.000Z	Eclypse	fyrestrtr	you are useless to me.
2006-08-10T13:24:00.000Z	Eclypse	fyrestrtr	you are the one who has the reading problem here, I mentioned from the beginning that I don't want a bloody guide, that means if you can't help don't bother messaging me.
2006-08-10T13:24:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Eclypse	I'm just telling you how it is. If you refuse help, that's a different story. I'm telling you that -- a *lot* have people have followed the wiki without any problems. Since I don't know how/what you have been doing, its easier to start clean from a common reference point. Call me useless? Fine. But anyone else will tell you the same.
2006-08-10T13:25:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Eclypse	the quality of help you get, is directly proportional to your attiude.
2006-08-10T13:27:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Eclypse	read the wiki, then come back if it doesn't work or if you face any confusion with the directions.
2006-08-10T13:27:00.000Z	Eclypse	fyrestrtr	I guess I'll read it for the 20th time now.
2006-09-10T11:36:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Eclypse	mount -t hsf /dev/cdrom /mnt/somehwere
2006-09-10T11:36:00.000Z	Eclypse	fyrestrtr	thanks
2006-09-10T11:38:00.000Z	Eclypse	fyrestrtr	it says "/media/cdrom0 is not a block device"
