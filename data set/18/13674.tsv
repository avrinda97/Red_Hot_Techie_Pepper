2006-09-10T07:38:00.000Z	Milktea		How do I mount an iso image
2006-09-10T07:40:00.000Z	vasi	Milktea	'mount -o loop foo.iso some-directory'
2006-09-10T08:01:00.000Z	vasi	Milktea	you're missing the library QtXml_debug
2006-09-10T08:01:00.000Z	vasi	Milktea	let me find out where that can be found
2006-09-10T08:08:00.000Z	Milktea	vasi	Did you find anything?
2006-09-10T08:09:00.000Z	vasi	Milktea	well for some reason it's trying to find the _debug versions
2006-09-10T08:10:00.000Z	vasi	Milktea	oh wait....
2006-09-10T08:10:00.000Z	vasi	Milktea	try installing libqt4-debug-dev
2006-09-10T08:37:00.000Z	vasi	Milktea	you see it says "rtaudio/RtAudio.cpp:3421:28: error: alsa/asoundlib.h: No such file or directory" ?
2006-09-10T08:37:00.000Z	vasi	Milktea	so you go to http://packages.ubuntu.com
2006-09-10T08:38:00.000Z	vasi	Milktea	and in the search box at the bottom of the page, put in the file you need
2006-09-10T08:38:00.000Z	vasi	Milktea	and it tells you which packages you want to install :-)
2006-09-10T08:45:00.000Z	Milktea	vasi	I have all the packages it told me to install
2006-09-10T08:45:00.000Z	vasi	Milktea	ok, so is it working now?
2006-09-10T08:46:00.000Z	vasi	Milktea	so you have the file /usr/include/alsa/asoundlib.h ?
2006-09-10T08:49:00.000Z	vasi	Milktea	then i don't think you have the package libasound2-dev
2006-09-10T08:50:00.000Z	vasi	Milktea	i've gotta go now, my RSI is acting up
2006-09-10T08:50:00.000Z	Milktea	vasi	Okay, thanks for your help :D
