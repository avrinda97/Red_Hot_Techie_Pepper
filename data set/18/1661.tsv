2011-02-04T17:41:00.000Z	erUSUL	azizLIGHTS	a certification authority is a company that issues cryptographic certificates like the ones used in https ( ssl ) websites
2011-02-04T17:42:00.000Z	erUSUL	azizLIGHTS	it is possible to create personal certificates afaik; deending on what you are doing it may be enough

2011-02-04T17:46:00.000Z	azizLIGHTS	erUSUL	yes thats the link im on, it doesnt explain anything in conceptual ways i havenoi diea what he talking bout
2011-02-04T17:47:00.000Z	azizLIGHTS	erUSUL	like practically speaking, what all that stuff means
2011-02-04T17:49:00.000Z	erUSUL	azizLIGHTS	well; from very high level --> the certification authority ensures that all the keys you are using ( by signing them etc ) are the keys they are supposed to be to avoid attacks.
2011-02-19T04:20:00.000Z	erUSUL	azizLIGHTS	maybe --> wget -r --no-parent http://webserver.com/index.html
2011-03-12T20:44:00.000Z	erUSUL	azizLIGHTS	do not think is possible
2011-03-12T20:45:00.000Z	erUSUL	azizLIGHTS	ask in #openssh though. maybe there is some trick
2011-03-18T23:53:00.000Z	erUSUL	azizLIGHTS	probably ~/.ssh/ has the wrong permissions. ( too loose )
