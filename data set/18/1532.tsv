2011-01-28T07:21:00.000Z	ChipCherou		Would installing ubuntu over ubuntu fix it?
2011-01-28T07:22:00.000Z	nejode	ChipCherou	can you get to a recovery mode prompt?
2011-01-28T07:23:00.000Z	ChipCherou	nejode	, nope... its not freezing...its like it doesn't have the bash files anymore
2011-01-28T07:25:00.000Z	nejode	ChipCherou	you can chroot into your filesystem fron the live CD
2011-01-28T07:26:00.000Z	ChipCherou	nejode	do you know the apt-get command to continue an upgrade?
2011-01-28T07:26:00.000Z	nejode	ChipCherou	"apt-get -f install"
2011-01-28T07:26:00.000Z	ChipCherou	nejode	does this sound about correct? http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-422523.html
2011-01-28T07:30:00.000Z	nejode	ChipCherou	that's about it... chroot into your filesystem, mount /dev and continue the upgrade
2011-01-28T07:31:00.000Z	ChipCherou	nejode	having problems finding my old disk...you bychance know of a smaller one?
2011-01-28T07:32:00.000Z	nejode	ChipCherou	smaller one???
2011-01-28T07:32:00.000Z	ChipCherou	nejode	smaller dvd to download
2011-01-28T07:33:00.000Z	nejode	ChipCherou	if you can work command line, there's a mini-iso of about 12 mb
2011-01-28T07:34:00.000Z	ChipCherou	nejode	it would be perfect if it has the commands I need (chroot ifconfig, etc...)
2011-01-28T07:35:00.000Z	ChipCherou	nejode	I take back ifconfig, I don't think I need it (it crashed during the installation part)
2011-01-28T07:36:00.000Z	nejode	ChipCherou	it's fairly easy, it has a text installer and because you download all the packages, your system will be updated
2011-01-28T07:36:00.000Z	ChipCherou	nejode	if I remember right, thats the network installer...trying to find it now
