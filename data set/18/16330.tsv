2004-12-20T12:51:00.000Z	jo		Hello, I want to use free Java tools with Ubuntu. I already noticed that sable-vm can be used as a virtual machine. But which Java compiler should I use?
2004-12-20T12:52:00.000Z	oik	jo	isn't gcj the least buggy free java?
2004-12-20T12:53:00.000Z	jo	oik	but can gcj ouput .class files instead of native code?
2004-12-20T12:55:00.000Z	jo	oik	oh ok, didn't know that. I have always used the Sun VM, but wanted to try the free tools too. Guess Mono's got an advantage here, since MS .NET isn't available for Linux while Sun's VM is. The classpath hackers certainly deserve some respect too ;-)
2004-12-20T12:55:00.000Z	oik	jo	also look at jikes
2004-12-20T12:56:00.000Z	jo	oik	I did try jikes, but it could't find the class library... Maybe gcj will automatically find the library :-) Damn I'm spoiled...
2004-12-20T12:59:00.000Z	oik	jo	what are you using java for, as a matter of interest?
2004-12-20T13:01:00.000Z	jo	oik	I suppose most existing jdk-1.4 programs won't run with the free tools?
2004-12-20T13:02:00.000Z	oik	jo	nope
2004-12-20T13:02:00.000Z	oik	jo	not unless they were written specially to work with them
2004-12-20T13:02:00.000Z	jo	oik	such as Eclipse?
2004-12-20T13:03:00.000Z	oik	jo	eclipse does work with gcj
2004-12-20T13:05:00.000Z	jo	oik	which Java version is _completely_ supported? Rewriting Eclipse to get it running on gcj kind of defeats the purpose of free java VM's and compilers.
2004-12-20T13:09:00.000Z	oik	jo	jikes needs a separate JRE to work, I believe
2004-12-20T13:10:00.000Z	oik	jo	I am using sun's JDK, not GCJ, so I can't really comment on spec files and suchlike.
2004-12-20T13:10:00.000Z	jo	oik	no problem, I think I'll return to Sun's too for now..
2004-12-20T13:13:00.000Z	oik	jo	hopefully the GCJ thing is just a packaging problem, but at least the sun stuff works.
2004-12-20T13:13:00.000Z	jo	oik	thanks for your help. I'm off now, bye!
