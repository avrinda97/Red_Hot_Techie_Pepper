2008-09-13T11:20:00.000Z	cotton		hrrm im having a problem, more like a confusion... I have an ati radeon 9000, I installed ubuntu without problems, the driver that comes with ubuntu by default seems to work amazingly, I have compiz with all the options and effects working amazing, thing is....is this technically correct? should i worry about installing a "driver"?
2008-09-13T11:20:00.000Z	cotton		thing is i wanna have dual monitors working...and i dont know how to make it work
2008-09-13T11:20:00.000Z	crdlb	cotton	there is no other driver for it
2008-09-13T11:21:00.000Z	crdlb	cotton	yes, the proprietary driver provided by ATI only works for 9500 and up
2008-09-13T11:22:00.000Z	cotton	crdlb	amazing, if this is the driver i love it, it works awesome, but...you know how can i get dual monitors working?
2008-09-13T11:23:00.000Z	crdlb	cotton	well, you're limited to 2048x2048 total
2008-09-13T11:24:00.000Z	crdlb	cotton	because that's the maximum texture size of pre-r500 (X1300+) radeons
2008-09-13T11:25:00.000Z	cotton	crdlb	damn...
2008-09-13T11:41:00.000Z	cotton	crdlb	if i get a new card, should i get a better resolution? or is the driver? i bought two brand mew 19" :(
2008-09-13T11:42:00.000Z	crdlb	cotton	it's the card, but getting a newer card would probably mean using a different driver
2008-09-13T11:43:00.000Z	cotton	crdlb	i have a nvidia FX 5something around here, that would be better i think, right?
2008-09-13T11:44:00.000Z	crdlb	cotton	yes, the limit for that is 4096x4096
2008-09-13T11:44:00.000Z	cotton	crdlb	it asked for propietary drivers
2008-09-13T11:49:00.000Z	cotton	crdlb	i installed the propietary drivers for the nvidia card, but now one of the monitors is not working and the other shows like a 1x1 resolution
2008-09-13T11:49:00.000Z	crdlb	cotton	you need to use nvidia-settings; the builtin ubuntu tool won't work well because nvidia doesn't like to implement Xorg standards :)
2008-09-13T11:50:00.000Z	cotton	crdlb	where can i find nvidia-settings?
2008-09-13T11:50:00.000Z	crdlb	cotton	there's an nvidia-settings package
2008-09-13T11:51:00.000Z	cotton	crdlb	installing, thanks, that should make it work then
