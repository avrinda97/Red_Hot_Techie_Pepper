2010-03-01T05:45:00.000Z	dexley		the rest of the screen is black!
2010-03-01T05:45:00.000Z	NewWorld	dexley	 Have you used Mplayer or xine engines?
2010-03-01T05:46:00.000Z	NewWorld	dexley	 Try to play an ogg video file, they are natively supported. See if it works; that will give us some useful info to work on.
2010-03-01T05:51:00.000Z	dexley	NewWorld	the sound is workin great but not videos! i can listen sounds correctly
2010-03-01T05:53:00.000Z	NewWorld	dexley	 Is there anything you changed recently that you think could have affected this?
2010-03-01T05:58:00.000Z	dexley	NewWorld	i dont know :( but: Mplayer cant be opend code:127 | No video playin with Gnomeplayer and KmPlayer | Only  DragonPlayer actually helps me out and is working good!
2010-03-01T05:59:00.000Z	NewWorld	dexley	 If kaffeine will work fine like DragonPlayer then you know that the xine engine works good. And it must be a problem with the other engines.
2010-03-01T06:00:00.000Z	dexley	NewWorld	the other engines?
2010-03-01T06:02:00.000Z	NewWorld	dexley	 The playback engine used by the application. Kaffine, D Player use xine. VLC uses it's own. gmplayer, smplayer, kmplayer use mplayer.

2010-03-01T06:22:00.000Z	NewWorld	dexley	 I don't see how :/ You still can't use the other playback engines :(
