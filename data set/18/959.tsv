2011-07-21T23:30:00.000Z	telxt		i have a ubuntu 11.04 running, which uses 200gb of my hdd, the rest of the hdd is used by other OS's. Now i want to add a new partition to ubuntu e.g /opt/vmware, is there any guide for this?
2011-07-21T23:30:00.000Z	MrNthDegree	telxt	go grab gparted, it's a graphical tool that makes life easy
2011-07-21T23:31:00.000Z	telxt		got 800gb left on this one :>
2011-07-21T23:33:00.000Z	telxt	MrNthDegree	could i allocate my ntfs file system with gparted and make it ext4?
2011-07-21T23:34:00.000Z	MrNthDegree	telxt	it'll let you resize partitions, and if you're not already using 4 primary partitions, you can make an extended partition which can contain many partitions inside it
2011-07-21T23:34:00.000Z	MrNthDegree	telxt	but make sure you back up first, resizing is always risky
2011-07-21T23:35:00.000Z	MrNthDegree		automatic sucks, make a /, /tmp, swap  and /home
2011-07-21T23:35:00.000Z	MrNthDegree		and that covers most use cases on the desktop
2011-07-21T23:36:00.000Z	telxt		kk thanks all
2011-07-21T23:37:00.000Z	telxt		another question: i didnt used linux for 2 years. back then it was possible to encrypt partitions while installing Ubuntu/Debian, i didnt see this option in 11.04.
2011-07-21T23:38:00.000Z	telxt		did this change came along with ext4?
2011-07-21T23:40:00.000Z	MrNthDegree	telxt	encrypting entire partitions should be avoided, it's in 90% of cases unnecessary
2011-07-21T23:40:00.000Z	MrNthDegree	telxt	with exception to swap and /tmp which can do with random keys/reformat on boot
2011-07-21T23:41:00.000Z	telxt	MrNthDegree	hm kk, so its not possible to encrypt everything except /boot?
2011-07-21T23:42:00.000Z	MrNthDegree	telxt	it is technically, but it's stupid to
2011-07-21T23:42:00.000Z	MrNthDegree	telxt	one gains no benefit from it because most of the data in /usr /var etc. it all OS data and is not private, nor gains any integrity from encryption
2011-07-21T23:43:00.000Z	telxt	MrNthDegree	k thanks alot.
2011-07-21T23:43:00.000Z	MrNthDegree	telxt	/home, /tmp and swap are the only things that really need encryption and /home/* is handled OOTB in the best way going
