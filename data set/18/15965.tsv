2004-12-13T09:00:00.000Z	TomT64		I used apt-get install libpng2, and apt-get install libpng3, and I still get the following error:
2004-12-13T09:00:00.000Z	TomT64		checking for png_create_read_struct in -lpng... no
2004-12-13T09:00:00.000Z	TomT64		configure: WARNING: libpng not found.  PNG support will not be compiled.
2004-12-13T09:00:00.000Z	TomT64		any suggestions on how to fix this?
2004-12-13T09:01:00.000Z	TomT64		no one?
2004-12-13T09:03:00.000Z	TomT64		ok I have two more questions
2004-12-13T09:03:00.000Z	TomT64		how do I mount an ntfs partition for read (and perhaps write)
2004-12-13T09:04:00.000Z	bronson	TomT64	Boot into Win NT.
2004-12-13T09:04:00.000Z	TomT64	bronson	haha
2004-12-13T09:04:00.000Z	bronson	TomT64	NTFS support on Linux is barely working.
2004-12-13T09:04:00.000Z	TomT64	bronson	I want to read some files and copy them over without using a third media
2004-12-13T09:07:00.000Z	bronson	TomT64	run "id"
2004-12-13T09:08:00.000Z	bronson	TomT64	cfdisk /dev/hd**
2004-12-13T09:09:00.000Z	bronson	TomT64	use "df -h" to tell you what /dev/ to use.
2004-12-13T09:10:00.000Z	TomT64	bronson	it's not listed
2004-12-13T09:11:00.000Z	bronson	TomT64	How doesn't cfdisk work?
2004-12-13T09:11:00.000Z	bronson	TomT64	run it as root.
2004-12-13T09:48:00.000Z	bronson	TomT64	no, grub does all its magic at boot time.
