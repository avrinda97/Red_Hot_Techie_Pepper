2008-03-30T10:10:00.000Z	tgelter		anyone know why there's such a lag after login (gnome) while the applets load?
2008-03-30T10:11:00.000Z	elpargo	tgelter	maybe you got a lot of them, applets are slow in loading.
2008-03-30T10:11:00.000Z	tgelter	elpargo	there are only too...
2008-03-30T10:11:00.000Z	elpargo	tgelter	define "a lot of time"
2008-03-30T10:13:00.000Z	tgelter	elpargo	I log in from gdm. The desktop is displayed + the two gnome-panels, then about 5-10 seconds pass while the applets load, and until they load, I'm unable to do anything
2008-03-30T10:13:00.000Z	elpargo	tgelter	yea that's a lot, have you try deleting them to be sure it's the applets?
2008-03-30T10:14:00.000Z	tgelter	elpargo	it happens on my laptop, on my desktop, and on my wife's laptop...I thought it was normal...
2008-03-30T10:15:00.000Z	elpargo	tgelter	the lag is normal it's loading a lot of things, but the times for you seem too much.
2008-03-30T10:15:00.000Z	tgelter	elpargo	interesting. is there no way to have them start preloading while gdm is loaded waiting for input?
2008-03-30T10:16:00.000Z	elpargo	tgelter	not in the way it's handle, whichs apps by the way?
2008-03-30T10:17:00.000Z	elpargo	tgelter	normally python applets are very slow at loading, because of the interface
2008-03-30T10:17:00.000Z	tgelter	elpargo	gnome-system-monitor, frequency scaling, and the normal "notifications"
2008-03-30T10:17:00.000Z	elpargo	tgelter	oh yes the system monitor is laggy, I don't use it anymore because of that.
2008-03-30T10:18:00.000Z	tgelter	elpargo	I see. any other recommendations for replacements/
2008-03-30T10:19:00.000Z	elpargo	tgelter	depends on your geekiness lvl, I don't really use any at the moment, but http://conky.sourceforge.net/ it's really neat.
2008-03-30T10:20:00.000Z	tgelter	elpargo	yeah, I've used conky before, I just always forget to install it...plus I like the desktop real estate it takes up. I was hoping for some other gnome-panel applet
2008-03-30T10:22:00.000Z	elpargo	tgelter	well there is always  gkrellm , but that's isn't gnome's specific.
2008-03-30T10:22:00.000Z	tgelter	elpargo	true true. thanks for the recommends & help
