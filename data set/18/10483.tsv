2007-11-22T12:10:00.000Z	MasterShrek	marko	ubuntu sudo is no different than any other sudo
2007-11-22T12:29:00.000Z	MasterShrek	marko	only privelidged users can use sudo
2007-11-22T12:31:00.000Z	MasterShrek	marko	the user that is installed first is generally the admin so its not really a problem, subsequent users do not have sudo access by default
2007-11-22T12:32:00.000Z	marko	MasterShrek	anyway , a user often choice a easy password for useracout = bill = bill

2007-11-22T12:37:00.000Z	MasterShrek	marko	seriously, ive had enough, take your trolling to #ubuntu-offtopic, this isnt the place to discuss such things, especially when you are talking about hacking
2007-11-22T12:41:00.000Z	marko	MasterShrek	promise im banned, but the best thing ubuntu do is a give them a world... as well goingon... i realy think in ubuntu terms as sudo is problem, my problem, but when hackers take own
