2007-12-23T23:37:00.000Z	Carb0n	puli	You need Adobe distiller to convert it into PDF
2007-12-23T23:38:00.000Z	Carb0n	puli	Or you might have forgotten the .ps extension.  Which one?
2007-12-23T23:38:00.000Z	Carb0n	puli	not the same.
2007-12-23T23:38:00.000Z	Carb0n	puli	goto commandline  -- type ps2pdf <filename.ps>
2007-12-23T23:40:00.000Z	Carb0n	puli	yeah.  ask someone to do it. :)
2007-12-23T23:40:00.000Z	Carb0n	puli	Neither am I.
2007-12-23T23:40:00.000Z	Carb0n	puli	It's Ubuntu!
2007-12-23T23:41:00.000Z	Carb0n	puli	anytime
2007-12-23T23:50:00.000Z	Carb0n	puli	Did you try ps2pdf. Or are you afraid to tread hot waters?
2007-12-23T23:58:00.000Z	Carb0n	puli	you still there?
2007-12-23T23:59:00.000Z	Carb0n	puli	what do you get when you type ps2pdf in the commandline?
2007-12-23T23:59:00.000Z	Carb0n	puli	Ubuntu will suggest the container package -- usually.
2007-12-24T00:01:00.000Z	Carb0n	puli	I guess it comes with gs-common
