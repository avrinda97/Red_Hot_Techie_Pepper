2004-12-09T16:11:00.000Z	Myke	melazyboy	if the problem is because you have 15k files.. you can always use a script to rename that...
2004-12-09T16:11:00.000Z	melazyboy	Myke	You guys must be completly missing the damn point...
2004-12-09T16:12:00.000Z	Myke	melazyboy	we have wrong ext for that file name, the program is warning you... you can change the ext for the files names... or change the program to supress the warning
2004-12-09T16:12:00.000Z	melazyboy	Myke	Since when where stupid precations hard coded into linux --- i don't want that one, now how do i change it? your essentially telling me 'install windows you can't have it your way', and im responding with, i don't want a workaround i want to fix the problem... these are shared on windows boxes as well
2004-12-09T16:16:00.000Z	Myke	melazyboy	since that looks like a security feature, you probably don't have a easy way out..
2004-12-09T16:18:00.000Z	Myke	melazyboy	try to grep gnome-vfs sources for that string...
2004-12-09T16:52:00.000Z	Myke	melazyboy	something tells me you shouldn't mix ubuntu and debian sid
2004-12-09T16:53:00.000Z	melazyboy	Myke	I would be inclined to agree, but still ... 262 newer pacakges... thats pretty sad
2004-12-09T16:53:00.000Z	melazyboy	Myke	one fo them is xorg-driver-synaptics, i wonder if that will fix my fglrx driver problem
2004-12-09T16:57:00.000Z	Myke	melazyboy	they probably colide
2004-12-10T17:03:00.000Z	Myke	melazyboy	in sid and ubuntu you have packages with diferent versions orders... so, you can end up updating to a older version.. and that's, not talking about that the two packs were compiled by diferent groups for diferent systems... so, one pack or two can be ok... system wide mixing of the two, probably ends up with some trouble
2004-12-10T17:04:00.000Z	melazyboy	Myke	Yea i can see it happening, just taking note to the difference... Ill have to designate a machine in the future to play around with that half of the prodcuts would be branned ubuntu, other half debian hahaga
2004-12-10T17:05:00.000Z	Myke	melazyboy	if you want what's in sid, just go for hoary...
2004-12-10T17:05:00.000Z	melazyboy	Myke	Im using hoary
2004-12-10T17:06:00.000Z	melazyboy	Myke	Sid still had 88 packages listing w/ higher versions, i checked some of them sid openoffice was newer than hoary, but for the reasons mentioned about target audience i think id prefer to not upgrade
2004-12-10T17:08:00.000Z	melazyboy	Myke	well i think when i checked openoffice, it was like 1.2.0-2, and sid was like 1.2.0-3, nothing major
2004-12-10T13:14:00.000Z	Myke	melazyboy	wrong
2004-12-10T13:19:00.000Z	Myke	melazyboy	i686 runs on k7
