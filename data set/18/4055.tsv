2010-01-28T10:15:00.000Z	resno		i know this isnt support but i am having a weird issue with my fresh ubuntu install. the screen and keyboard lights are flashing.
2010-01-28T10:16:00.000Z	edbian	resno	Actually, this is support! :)
2010-01-28T10:16:00.000Z	edbian	resno	That usually means you have a stick of bad ram
2010-01-28T10:16:00.000Z	resno	edbian	how can itest that?
2010-01-28T10:16:00.000Z	edbian	resno	Do you have the memtest86+ option in your boot menu?  That is a ram testing program
2010-01-28T10:17:00.000Z	edbian	resno	Alternatively, remove the ram sticks one at a time and see if the problem goes away.
2010-01-28T10:17:00.000Z	edbian	resno	The memory on the video card may be bad.
2010-01-28T10:18:00.000Z	resno	edbian	i can get it to boot into live cd. however i get sr0 error along the way
2010-01-28T10:19:00.000Z	edbian	resno	sr0 errors mean the CD has very minor scratches in it.  Like skipping on a music CD.  If there are too many the system won't boot.
2011-12-25T22:27:00.000Z	edbian	resno	it's boots and then it freezes?  or it never finishes booting?
2011-12-25T22:27:00.000Z	edbian	resno	I am assuming you can't log in?
2011-12-25T22:28:00.000Z	resno	edbian	it starts booting then freezes.
2011-12-25T22:29:00.000Z	edbian	resno	what card is it?
2011-12-25T22:29:00.000Z	edbian	resno	reboot, press shift early during boot, choose 'recovery mode'
2011-12-25T22:29:00.000Z	resno	edbian	shift!
2011-12-25T22:29:00.000Z	edbian	resno	shift
2011-12-25T22:32:00.000Z	resno	edbian	ah, that worked, and i can fix it from here. thanks :)
2011-12-25T22:33:00.000Z	edbian	resno	sure, have fun yo
