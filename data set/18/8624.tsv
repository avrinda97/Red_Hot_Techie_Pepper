2007-07-22T09:18:00.000Z	BrendanM	Wahyudinata	what're you trying to do?
2007-07-22T09:18:00.000Z	Wahyudinata	BrendanM	installing it
2007-07-22T09:19:00.000Z	BrendanM	Wahyudinata	yeah, I'd try the text installer
2007-07-22T09:20:00.000Z	Wahyudinata	BrendanM	how to access that?
2007-07-22T09:21:00.000Z	BrendanM	Wahyudinata	unfortunately, it's a separate CD image you have to download and burn. Does anyone know why they don't build it into the live CD too?
2007-07-22T09:22:00.000Z	Wahyudinata	BrendanM	holy cupcake, i'll just install the server version then
2007-07-22T09:24:00.000Z	Wahyudinata	BrendanM	can I do that using the desktop and apt get the server apps?
2007-07-22T09:24:00.000Z	BrendanM	Wahyudinata	you can apt-get basically everything. Is it LAMP you want for the server?
2007-07-22T09:27:00.000Z	BrendanM	Wahyudinata	here's a LAMP guide: http://www.howtoforge.com/ubuntu_lamp_for_newbies   I think I used a different one when I set up my LAMP server, but that one looks like it should work
2007-07-22T09:27:00.000Z	Wahyudinata	BrendanM	thanks
