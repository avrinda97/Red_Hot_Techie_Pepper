2010-04-03T06:28:00.000Z	giiker		hi everyone, need recomendations on what to run o a file server for sharing and backing up data. I also need authentication and maybe on the fly encription?!
2010-04-03T06:28:00.000Z	daftykins	giiker	SAMBA works great. you don't want to be running a file server as a VM though...
2010-04-03T06:29:00.000Z	giiker	daftykins	I was thinking on dl Ubuntu server and install samba there and see how it feels
2010-04-03T06:29:00.000Z	daftykins	giiker	yeah i did just that for a new server recently. i get 115MB/sec over gigabit LAN so all works well :D
2010-04-03T06:30:00.000Z	giiker	daftykins	wow 115 MBps. I also need to secure the connection to Smaba, what if someone starts sniffing traffic on the LAN?
2010-04-03T06:31:00.000Z	giiker	daftykins	this friend has confidential data, it needs to be secured when it is stored or transmited
2010-04-03T06:32:00.000Z	daftykins	giiker	you can set samba to be locked down on a per-IP basis, so you could set all the PCs to be statically addressed then permit only the right ones. also then have user+pass on top
2010-04-03T06:32:00.000Z	daftykins	giiker	that's not really going to happen with samba. or windows clients ;)
2010-04-03T06:33:00.000Z	giiker	daftykins	with a sniffer bad haxor can scope the LAN and impersonate the real owner IP, is the authentication secured?
2010-04-03T06:34:00.000Z	daftykins	giiker	yes encrypted password storage
2010-04-03T06:34:00.000Z	giiker	daftykins	just found the wiki for samba, uggghh, to much to read
2010-04-03T06:34:00.000Z	giiker	daftykins	I meant, is the authentication process encrypted or on the clear?
2010-04-03T06:35:00.000Z	daftykins	giiker	hehe, yeah you don't really need to read it all
2010-04-03T06:36:00.000Z	daftykins	giiker	now you found the wiki that can answer your questions :)
2010-04-03T06:37:00.000Z	giiker	daftykins	yeap! i guess I'll read it. Did you install any backup app? or just using rsync and old school tools only?
2010-04-03T06:38:00.000Z	daftykins	giiker	the box i built has a 12TB RAID6 array, so backup isn't really so important yet. i'll need to look into something though to make use of USB external HDDs to backup to
2010-04-03T06:38:00.000Z	daftykins	giiker	i'll probably learn to use rsync/zsync
2010-04-03T06:51:00.000Z	giiker	daftykins	bye
