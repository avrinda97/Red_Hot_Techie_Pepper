2011-12-08T01:14:00.000Z	freemason1977		the desktop is either behind this blue one or its being shut down on boot
2011-12-08T01:14:00.000Z	freemason1977		sudo apt-get -y purge ubuntu-desktop ; sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
2011-12-08T01:14:00.000Z	freemason1977		that command wants over 300MB's
2011-12-08T01:15:00.000Z	freemason1977		please someone help
2011-12-08T01:15:00.000Z	freemason1977		?
2011-12-08T01:16:00.000Z	freemason1977		this is incredibly harrasing
2011-12-08T01:17:00.000Z	freemason1977		The desktop gets  "overwritten" on bootup
2011-12-08T01:17:00.000Z	freemason1977		It reverts or brings up a different desktop with a blue background and only one folder on it
2011-12-08T01:18:00.000Z	freemason1977		First my original desktop comes up and then this other one with a bluebackground
2011-12-08T01:18:00.000Z	freemason1977		blue background *
2011-12-08T01:18:00.000Z	geoffmcc	freemason1977	when did it start doing it? what was done before it started happening?
2011-12-08T01:19:00.000Z	freemason1977	geoffmcc	 i haven't done anything at all AFAIK
2011-12-08T01:19:00.000Z	geoffmcc	freemason1977	ok, what updates were installed?

2011-12-08T01:22:00.000Z	geoffmcc	freemason1977	when you did an update did you also activate any display drivers?
