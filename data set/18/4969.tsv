2010-08-23T21:31:00.000Z	j800r		hey guys, when i put certain audio cds in to rip to my library they don't mount, and the CD drive disappears. anyone know what the problem might be? :\
2010-08-23T21:33:00.000Z	sacarlson	j800r	bad cd?
2010-08-23T21:33:00.000Z	j800r		nop, recognised fine in windows and itunes ripped it without an issue
2010-08-23T21:33:00.000Z	sacarlson	j800r	in the same drive?  on the same computer?
2010-08-23T21:33:00.000Z	j800r		yes
2010-08-23T21:34:00.000Z	sacarlson	j800r	oh and you said certain audio cd's not all?
2010-08-23T21:34:00.000Z	j800r		ya, i just ripped one fine
2010-08-23T21:35:00.000Z	j800r		lol, apparently my drive likes Marilyn Manson, but not Paradise Lost
2010-08-23T21:35:00.000Z	sacarlson	j800r	maybe the have retry count set to a higher number
2010-08-23T21:35:00.000Z	j800r	sacarlson	also when i eject the drive it auto-closes :s
2010-08-23T21:36:00.000Z	j800r		maybe there's a stuck process or something? maybe i should just try rebooting
2010-08-23T21:36:00.000Z	sacarlson	j800r	well if you have something that works better I would keep it at that.
2010-08-23T21:37:00.000Z	j800r		hmmm...i'll try restarting my system and go from there. my drive may just be having a spazz
2010-08-23T21:39:00.000Z	j800r		crisis averted
2010-08-23T21:39:00.000Z	j800r		i rebooted and the cd mounted immediately. it must have been a stuck process or something
2010-08-23T21:39:00.000Z	sacarlson	j800r	let me guess cleaned the cd?
2010-08-23T21:40:00.000Z	j800r		nop. just a simple reboot :P
2010-08-23T21:40:00.000Z	sacarlson	j800r	cool
