2007-05-14T13:05:00.000Z	jean		hello all
2007-05-14T13:06:00.000Z	jean		when trying to change the hostname of my pc i get the error msg "The default Gateway IP address is invalid."
2007-05-14T13:06:00.000Z	jean		why can't i change my computer's name?
2007-05-14T13:07:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	jean	You can. System > Administration > Networking ... General ... Host name
2007-05-14T13:09:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	jean	It sounds as if you have a bad manual setting for your network card. Check the properties in the "Connections" tab
2007-05-14T13:10:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	jean	ahhh, ok, well there's got to be something similar but I don't use KDE
2007-05-14T13:11:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	jean	DNS is not the pace
2007-05-14T13:11:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	jean	the default gateway is set with each network adapter
2007-05-14T13:13:00.000Z	jean	IntuitiveNipple	how to know the setting of my default gateway,
2007-05-14T13:14:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	jean	the setting itself will probably be in /etc/network/interfaces
2007-05-14T13:14:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	jean	edit /etc/hosts
2007-05-14T13:16:00.000Z	jean	IntuitiveNipple	what should i look for in /etc/network/interfaces?
2007-05-14T13:16:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	jean	"gateway"
2007-05-14T13:17:00.000Z	jean	IntuitiveNipple	no gateway
2007-05-14T13:18:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	jean	that might be why the network manager is complaining, but I can't be sure
2007-05-14T13:20:00.000Z	jean	IntuitiveNipple	in /etc/hosts, the name next to 127.0.1.1 do not match hostname
2007-05-14T13:20:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	jean	that would help, to have it match :D
2007-05-14T13:20:00.000Z	jean	IntuitiveNipple	it is my previous hostname
