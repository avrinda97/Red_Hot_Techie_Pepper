2004-10-02T05:43:00.000Z	joebeastie		doh. one problem encounter so far. it is a debian installer problem and not a ubuntu problem though
2004-10-02T05:44:00.000Z	Kamion	joebeastie	bring it on
2004-10-02T05:44:00.000Z	joebeastie		well two. installer does not ask for the essid when setting up a wireless network and two the grub config tool did not automatically find my openbsd installation.
2004-10-02T05:45:00.000Z	joebeastie		the new grub-setup tool in slackware current does find and name my openbsd partition correctly in menu.lst
2004-10-02T05:45:00.000Z	Kamion	joebeastie	it tries the 'any' essid first, and if that works it just goes ahead and uses it
2004-10-02T05:45:00.000Z	Kamion	joebeastie	the code to detect BSD filesystems just doesn't exist right now, I'm afraid
2004-10-02T05:46:00.000Z	Kamion		Alastair McKinstry started to write it but apparently never finished
2004-10-02T05:46:00.000Z	joebeastie	Kamion	well you might be right there. my nieghbor has a wap up and is not wep and dhcp so that might conflicted with mine
2004-10-02T05:46:00.000Z	Kamion		I'll have to have a look at grub-setup then and see if we can use its code in os-prober
2004-10-02T05:46:00.000Z	joebeastie	Kamion	i am going to tell him sooner or later about fixing his netowrk
2004-10-02T05:46:00.000Z	Kamion		is it sanely licensed?
2004-10-02T05:46:00.000Z	joebeastie	Kamion	it is in slack so no idea
2004-10-02T05:47:00.000Z	Kamion	joebeastie	any idea where I can find it? I don't know slackware
2004-10-02T05:47:00.000Z	Kamion		nor BSD, for that matter ...
2004-10-02T05:47:00.000Z	joebeastie	Kamion	yea hold on a sec
2004-10-02T05:54:00.000Z	joebeastie	Kamion	ok i found out they do not use their own tool but rather a tool from someone else. you can find that said tool here: http://www.tux.org/pub/people/kent-robotti/looplinux/index.html - grubconfig is at the bottom
2004-10-02T05:55:00.000Z	Kamion	joebeastie	thanks
2004-10-02T05:55:00.000Z	joebeastie	Kamion	welcome
