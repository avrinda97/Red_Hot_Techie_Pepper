2010-11-22T16:22:00.000Z	Keloran	vic20gmr	it also depends on if your bios supports booting from USB, and if the USB your using actually supports being booted from
2010-11-22T16:23:00.000Z	Keloran	vic20gmr	so your your bios supports it but your using a USB pen you got free from a cereal box then your never going to be able to boot from it
2010-11-22T16:24:00.000Z	vic20gmr	Keloran	i got the usb drive from my dad, he had several, and gave me one
2010-11-22T16:28:00.000Z	Keloran	vic20gmr	does your bios have "usb-hdd/usb-fdd" option in the boot order ?
2010-11-22T16:31:00.000Z	Keloran	vic20gmr	if your in linux already what did you use to copy the iso to your pen ?
2010-11-22T16:32:00.000Z	vic20gmr	Keloran	im on bunut 10.04, and ive experienced some problems with wine, and particular programs, im hoping by going to 10.10 i might get later versins of things, and hopefully have better video performance
2010-11-22T16:34:00.000Z	Keloran	vic20gmr	tried using usb-creator ?
2010-11-22T16:35:00.000Z	Keloran	vic20gmr	"https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick#Creating a bootable Ubuntu USB flash drive"
2010-11-22T16:36:00.000Z	vic20gmr	Keloran	thankyou, but ive referred to that already, its part of how ive gottenthis far
2010-11-22T16:38:00.000Z	Keloran	vic20gmr	so you created the bootable pen drive from that app ?, or did you use "dd"
2010-11-22T16:39:00.000Z	vic20gmr	Keloran	i used ubuntu usb creator, and the tried ubootin, i tried both
2010-11-22T16:40:00.000Z	Keloran	vic20gmr	its looking more likelly that the pen itself cant be booted from
2010-11-22T16:43:00.000Z	Keloran	vic20gmr	ive had trouble with all kingston's, non of them can boot, pny's though can boot
2010-11-22T16:43:00.000Z	vic20gmr	Keloran	ive been using a 2gb pqi drive, but i have a 4gb pny
2010-11-22T17:22:00.000Z	vic20gmr	Keloran	i just tried usb-creator on my 4gb [pny] flashdrive, it griped about checksum also, have anysuggestions?
2010-11-22T17:50:00.000Z	Keloran	vic20gmr	thats very unlikelly (possible, since plug anything into one of my ports on my work machine and it throws a wobbly)
2010-11-22T17:53:00.000Z	vic20gmr	Keloran	this is output of the hwtest program http://paste.pocoo.org/show/294556/
2010-11-22T17:53:00.000Z	vic20gmr	Keloran	what do you make of it?
