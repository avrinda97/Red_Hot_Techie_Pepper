2010-06-09T07:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Bleach	no Safari for Linux distros,  and plenty of other better browsers to choose from :)
2010-06-09T07:37:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Bleach	also the rendering engine which Safari and Chrome and Chromium use Webkit, is based on KHTML what Konqueror uses, and now thats a pretty nice browser to have in a Linux distro :)
2010-06-09T07:37:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Bleach	if you don't want to use Firefox I mean
2010-06-09T07:37:00.000Z	Bleach	sebsebseb	how can i.. becoz im using gnome.. not kde
2010-06-09T07:38:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Bleach	if you do a browser in Wine, and don't change the user agent,   website statistics will be told that your using Windows
2010-06-09T07:38:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Bleach	you can  run most KDE apps inside Gnome as well
2010-06-09T07:39:00.000Z	Bleach	sebsebseb	so do u give me a linux deb file link for that kde browser
2010-06-09T07:40:00.000Z	Bleach	sebsebseb	so that i might use
2010-06-09T07:40:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Bleach	uhmm the good browsers for Ubuntu are already in the repo
2010-06-09T07:40:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Bleach	uh not just Ubuntu, other Linux distros as well
2010-06-09T07:42:00.000Z	Bleach	sebsebseb	i had tryout that midori.. but its a waste of time..
2010-06-09T07:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Bleach	yeah midori is new not tried it yet actsaully
2010-06-09T07:43:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Bleach	KHTML is the rendering engine that Konqueror uses to display webpages
2010-06-09T07:43:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Bleach	Apple decided to fork it and make their own version and so made Webkit, which  Safari, Chrome, Chromium, and some other browsers use
2010-06-09T07:44:00.000Z	Bleach	sebsebseb	the new html5 concept while apple said abt.. will e supported..
2010-06-09T07:45:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Bleach	musturd  Windows is pretty sucky really when it comes to browser choice, much more choice in a Linux distro
2010-06-09T07:45:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Bleach	musturd even text only browsers, which can be fun to play around with a bit
