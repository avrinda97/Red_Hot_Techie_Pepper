2008-12-21T00:42:00.000Z	another_girl		hi guys! do someone know how to change default permissions on automounted usb drives?
2008-12-21T00:42:00.000Z	another_girl		a kiss for the winner
2008-12-21T00:44:00.000Z	another_girl		nope joeb3_ , it changes the rights when the usb drive is mounted
2008-12-21T00:45:00.000Z	another_girl		and i would like to change the defaults rights (which are 700)
2008-12-21T00:46:00.000Z	droopsta915	another_girl	try sudo chmod 700 /media/disk
2008-12-21T00:50:00.000Z	another_girl	droopsta915	I would like to share usb drives over network
2008-12-21T00:51:00.000Z	another_girl	droopsta915	but when a usb drive is mounted, its rights are 700, so nobody on the network can access it apart the owner
2008-12-21T00:51:00.000Z	another_girl	droopsta915	so i need to change the defaults rights from 700 to 770 or 777
2008-12-21T00:53:00.000Z	another_girl	droopsta915	ubuntu automounts each new usb drive in a new folder, each new folder is 700
2008-12-21T00:54:00.000Z	droopsta915	another_girl	does yours mount into /media?
2008-12-21T00:55:00.000Z	droopsta915	another_girl	give /media the 770 or 777 permission, I think that will work
