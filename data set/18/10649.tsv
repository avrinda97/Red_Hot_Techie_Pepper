2007-04-22T13:57:00.000Z	NemesisD		does anyone know what "linking the kernel source from the modules directory" means and how to do it?
2007-04-22T13:58:00.000Z	NemesisD		i get a massive amount of errors when i try to compile ndiswrapper
2007-04-22T13:58:00.000Z	NemesisD		hoo hoo
2007-04-22T14:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U	NemesisD	Sorry to interupt but if you have a broadcom card have you tried fwcutter ( to use native drivers ) instead of NDIS wrapper?
2007-04-22T14:01:00.000Z	NemesisD	Jordan_U	its a dlink usb dongle with an atheros board
2007-06-02T09:45:00.000Z	Jordan_U	NemesisD	They are still the best way to do large incremental backups
2007-06-02T09:46:00.000Z	NemesisD	Jordan_U	or so i hear. From all the trouble Ive had with this one I am skeptical ;)
2007-06-13T09:44:00.000Z	Jordan_U	NemesisD	If it includes the MBR, yes
2007-06-13T09:47:00.000Z	NemesisD	Jordan_U	what if the source drive was like 20gb and we put it on a blank 40gb drive or something?
2007-06-13T09:47:00.000Z	Jordan_U	NemesisD	I believe it would still work
2007-06-13T09:48:00.000Z	NemesisD	Jordan_U	to run a consistency check on the image to make sure its not messed up would it be fsck -y foo.img?
2007-06-30T10:44:00.000Z	Jordan_U	NemesisD	ifconfig
2007-07-12T13:36:00.000Z	Jordan_U	NemesisD	System -> Preferences -> Sound
2007-07-12T13:33:00.000Z	Jordan_U	NemesisD	Yes
2007-07-12T13:33:00.000Z	NemesisD	Jordan_U	do tell
2007-07-12T13:34:00.000Z	Jordan_U	NemesisD	System -> Administration -> Login Window
2007-07-12T13:35:00.000Z	NemesisD	Jordan_U	ok i disabled the sound in accessability now where do i get rid of that short jingle when you actually log in? it's showing login successful as empty so that can't be it
