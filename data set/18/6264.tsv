2008-06-26T02:02:00.000Z	unr3a1_		I connected my iPod to my ubuntu computer, and now whenever i unplug it, the ipod says there is no music.  how can I rectify this?
2008-06-26T02:03:00.000Z	unr3a1_		does anyone know how I can get my ipod to play my music again?
2008-06-26T02:04:00.000Z	unr3a1_		install rockbox?
2008-06-26T02:04:00.000Z	unr3a1_		onto what, the iPod?
2008-06-26T02:04:00.000Z	unop	unr3a1_	what application did you use to manage the ipod?
2008-06-26T02:05:00.000Z	unop	unr3a1_	and does rhythmbox say there is music on the ipod?
2008-06-26T02:05:00.000Z	unr3a1_	unop	yes.  but if I eject the ipod, then the ipod doesnt show any music
2008-06-26T02:07:00.000Z	unop	unr3a1_	it's likely you copied music to the ipod using it as an external storage not via the itunes database .. you might want to try out gtkpod - it's what i use
2008-06-26T02:09:00.000Z	unr3a1_	unop	how do I get the ipod to recognize its music again?
2008-06-26T02:10:00.000Z	unop	unr3a1_	gtkpod works almost drag and drop once you have set it up for your ipod
2008-06-26T02:11:00.000Z	unr3a1_	unop	 Alright.  So you are saying once gtkpod sees the ipod, loads its music, I should be able to disconnect it and now have my ipod see the music on it?
2008-06-26T02:12:00.000Z	unr3a1_	unop	 cause what happened was, I loaded music on the ipod through rhythymbox, which succeeded, then when i ejected the ipod, it doesn't show any of the music on it
2008-06-26T02:12:00.000Z	unop	unr3a1_	no, what i mean is - you might have accidentally used your ipod as an external storage device (data use) with rhythmbox - so the music has been copied onto the ipod but the music has not been registered in the ipod's itunes database -- so what you need to do is use gtkpod to copy that music the right way
2008-06-26T02:12:00.000Z	unr3a1_	unop	 ok, but none of the music is viewable on the ipod
2008-06-26T02:13:00.000Z	unop	unr3a1_	exactly - you can use your ipod in such a way that it does not recognize files you put on it - you can use it as a backup portable harddrive
2008-06-26T02:13:00.000Z	unop	unr3a1_	which means you can copy anything you want, even music onto it's harddrive - but that does not mean the ipod's firmware will be able to see or play it
2008-06-26T02:14:00.000Z	unop	unr3a1_	ipods require you copy music into specific folders and have all the music copied also registered into the itunes database -- only then will the ipod be able to play the music
