2010-06-23T05:11:00.000Z	Typos_King	Guest54403	  not sure anyone here knows what a 'trouble ticket' is to begin with
2010-06-23T05:19:00.000Z	Typos_King	Guest54403	  yes, I do, and several other folks, what is the relevance of it in the channel again?
2010-06-23T05:20:00.000Z	Guest54403	Typos_King	coz i need to install that in my ubuntu.. can anyone help me with that?
2010-06-23T05:23:00.000Z	Typos_King	Guest54403	   installing a trouble ticket?    you'd usually just write it down, and it becomes your 'inquiry' reference number for the helpdesk that issued it, not sure on installing it
2010-06-23T05:24:00.000Z	Guest54403	Typos_King	yup that's it but im having a hard time what open source trouble ticket will i use and how to install it here in ubuntu
2010-06-23T05:25:00.000Z	Typos_King	Guest54403	  sounds more like you're confused, can you gives us the url of the page that gave you those instructions?
2010-06-23T05:27:00.000Z	Guest54403	Typos_King	here's the link http://otrs.org/
2010-06-23T05:32:00.000Z	Typos_King	Guest54403	    well, is an app to help people in a techhelp desk, to organize and track tickets, is all, most likely a database-based CMS
2010-06-23T05:33:00.000Z	Typos_King	Guest54403	    I'd expect that for usage for people with high call volumes, otherwise, I can probably do the whole thing from a spreadsheet
2010-06-23T05:33:00.000Z	Guest54403	Typos_King	yup.. but im having a hard time installing it.. im done with the mysql part but i can't understand what's next
2010-06-23T05:34:00.000Z	Typos_King	Guest54403	   yeah, but ... well. I don't use it, soooo, your question is specific to this otrs.org app, no a ubuntu per se
2010-06-23T05:35:00.000Z	Guest54403	Typos_King	i mean im having a hard time installing it here in ubuntu
2010-06-23T05:36:00.000Z	Typos_King	Guest54403	  well, .... can't say... still doesn't make it a ubuntu-core component issue, just an installation matter, if I'd use it, I'd be able to help more, but I don't, so
2010-06-23T05:39:00.000Z	Guest54403	Typos_King	it's okei thanks anyweiz.. got to go now
