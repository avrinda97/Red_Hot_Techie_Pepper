2011-10-26T18:21:00.000Z	Dmole		how can I get a list of supported FSs from the console (like shown in gparted)?
2011-10-26T18:21:00.000Z	dr_willis	Dmole	 there used to be a cat /proc/filesystems
2011-10-26T18:21:00.000Z	dr_willis	Dmole	 :)
2011-10-26T18:22:00.000Z	dr_willis	Dmole	 that should show all fs's the kernel supports. I think
2011-10-26T18:22:00.000Z	Dmole	dr_willis	thanks It's missing a few but it's close.
2011-10-26T18:23:00.000Z	Dmole	dr_willis	(exfat in particular)
2011-10-26T18:24:00.000Z	dr_willis	Dmole	 i seem to recall that one being special..its like a subset of vfat? I cant rember the details..
2011-10-26T18:24:00.000Z	Dmole	dr_willis	I'm thinking it's FUSE related
2011-10-26T18:25:00.000Z	Dmole	dr_willis	ntfs is also missing
2011-10-26T18:25:00.000Z	dr_willis	Dmole	 theres dozens of fuse thigs :) its an amazing tool. but im not even sure what exfat is for.
2011-10-26T18:25:00.000Z	dr_willis	Dmole	 its ntfs-3g i thought these days. Its possible ythat list is Not showing the modules for fs's you can load.
2011-10-26T18:26:00.000Z	Dmole	dr_willis	exfat is the replacement for FAT32 it's supported by win, mac, and linux
2011-10-26T18:26:00.000Z	dr_willis	Dmole	 i thought that was vfat.. or am i getting confused again. :)
2011-10-26T18:28:00.000Z	dr_willis	Dmole	 i seem tobe accessing a HPFS/NTFS/exFAT filesystem just fine. (from what sudo fdisk -l) calls my windows partition. :)
2011-10-26T18:28:00.000Z	Dmole	dr_willis	vfat is fat32 with long names still limited to 2 TB
2011-10-26T18:28:00.000Z	dr_willis	Dmole	 but i bet its because of the way ntfs-3g works with fuse..
2011-10-26T18:31:00.000Z	Dmole	dr_willis	seems searching $PATH for mk* is the best option so far~
2011-10-26T18:36:00.000Z	Dmole	dr_willis	ls -1 $(echo $PATH|perl -p -e 's/:/ /g')|grep "^mk"|grep fs
