2011-04-29T22:22:00.000Z	dooglus	frag4now	/var/cache/apt/archives/
2011-04-29T22:22:00.000Z	frag4now	dooglus	thanks
2011-04-29T22:22:00.000Z	dooglus	frag4now	"locate .deb"
2011-04-29T22:22:00.000Z	frag4now	dooglus	doh! :P
2011-04-29T22:22:00.000Z	dooglus	frag4now	"sudo apt-get clean" will delete them and free a bunch of space.  you don't need them once they're installed
2011-04-29T22:23:00.000Z	frag4now	dooglus	noooooooooooooo :) I have two ubuntu and i don't want to download upgrade packages two times ;)
2011-04-29T22:23:00.000Z	dooglus	frag4now	look into apt-cacher.  that's what I use to only download each package once
2011-04-29T22:23:00.000Z	frag4now		apt-cacher?
2011-04-29T22:24:00.000Z	frag4now	dooglus	^
2011-04-29T22:24:00.000Z	dooglus	frag4now	each of my computers points to the 'server' in its sources.list, and the server caches the .deb files, so each one is only downloaded once
2011-04-29T22:24:00.000Z	dooglus		!info apt-cacher
2011-04-29T22:25:00.000Z	frag4now	dooglus	and what if i copy by my hand packages...deb packages are i386...they work with ever arch...
2011-04-29T22:25:00.000Z	dooglus	frag4now	some .deb files are arch-independant.  some aren't
2011-04-29T22:25:00.000Z	dooglus	frag4now	apt-cacher will take care of that for you
2011-04-29T22:26:00.000Z	frag4now	dooglus	i'll copy packages and apt-get will download package dependant only...it's the same
2011-04-29T22:27:00.000Z	dooglus	frag4now	if the package name has _i386.deb at the end, it's Intel.  if it has _all.deb, it's independent
2011-04-29T22:27:00.000Z	frag4now	dooglus	i386 it's a kind of arch
