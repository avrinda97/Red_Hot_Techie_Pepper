2009-07-25T11:20:00.000Z	frankpanda		Headless server Xorg.log tells: (EE) No devices detected. Is it normal for headless? I can't remote X via XDMCP now...
2009-07-25T11:21:00.000Z	n2diy	frankpanda	I don't think servers have X installed?
2009-07-25T11:22:00.000Z	frankpanda	n2diy	It works before, may not work after some update ?
2009-07-25T11:23:00.000Z	n2diy	frankpanda	yes, who knows?
2009-07-25T11:24:00.000Z	frankpanda	n2diy	try the gdm debug mode, no useful info just say can't start X, using VNC instead
2009-07-25T11:25:00.000Z	n2diy	frankpanda	can you ssh into the box?
2009-07-25T11:27:00.000Z	n2diy	frankpanda	I'd look in /etc/X11/ for xorg.conf and see if there is an old/backup file, that you could overwrite xorg.conf with.
2009-07-25T11:32:00.000Z	n2diy	frankpanda	ok, what do you see if you look in /etc/X11, any gdm or xorg.conf files that could replace your current ones?
2009-07-25T11:32:00.000Z	frankpanda	n2diy	/var/log/message may have some detail information after using debug mode
2009-07-25T11:33:00.000Z	n2diy	frankpanda	could be, but log files are about as fun to read as man files.
2009-07-25T11:34:00.000Z	n2diy	frankpanda	use pastebin, don't copy and paste here, or they get upset.
2009-07-25T11:34:00.000Z	frankpanda	n2diy	roger, new to irc :)

2009-07-25T11:41:00.000Z	n2diy	frankpanda	roger, wait.
2009-07-25T11:44:00.000Z	n2diy	frankpanda	ok, makes no sense to me, maybe the folks in #xorg could help you?
2009-07-25T11:45:00.000Z	frankpanda	n2diy	thx all the same, for it works before, I got no clue after debug
2009-07-25T11:47:00.000Z	frankpanda	n2diy	I can't find the Xaccess config file for gdm, not under /etc/gdm?
2009-07-25T11:48:00.000Z	n2diy	frankpanda	well, I can't help you, you are in over my head. I have a laptop with a similar problem to work on tomorrow, so who knows what is going to happen? Maybe tomorrow moring I'll have a clue?
