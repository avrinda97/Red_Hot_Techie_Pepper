2005-02-24T15:17:00.000Z	Gul3		is it possible to grant write access to my ntsf partition using ubuntu live cd?
2005-02-24T15:18:00.000Z	moquist	Gul3	I didn't think Linux had safe NTFS write access at all.  ??
2005-02-24T15:22:00.000Z	moquist	Gul3	are you familiar with the 'dd' command?
2005-02-24T15:22:00.000Z	Gul3	moquist	no
2005-02-24T15:22:00.000Z	moquist	Gul3	are you comfortable on the command line?
2005-02-24T15:23:00.000Z	Gul3	moquist	yes
2005-02-24T15:23:00.000Z	Gul3	moquist	a bit..
2005-02-24T15:23:00.000Z	moquist	Gul3	man dd, and pay close attention to the 'seek' and 'skip' options
2005-02-24T15:23:00.000Z	moquist	Gul3	that's one way to split up a file
2005-02-24T15:23:00.000Z	Gul3	moquist	i don't understand man pages. lol
2005-02-24T15:23:00.000Z	moquist	Gul3	oh, i forgot "are you comforable with man pages?"  ;)
2005-02-24T15:24:00.000Z	Gul3	moquist	lol :)
2005-02-24T15:24:00.000Z	Gul3	moquist	i want to take it anoter way around then. how can i mount a iso file in linux using this live cd?
2005-02-24T15:24:00.000Z	moquist	Gul3	basically, you tell dd where to get data ("if"), where to put it ("of"), how big each data chunk should be ("bs", I use "bs=1M"), and how many data chunks to move ("count").
2005-02-24T15:25:00.000Z	moquist	Gul3	then you can tell dd how much of the input to skip ("skip") and how far to seek into the output before writing ("seek").
2005-02-24T15:25:00.000Z	moquist	Gul3	oh, that's way easy.
2005-02-24T15:25:00.000Z	moquist	Gul3	mount -oloop -tiso9660 /path/path/path/myiso.iso /mnt/tmp/
2005-02-24T15:27:00.000Z	Gul3	moquist	thanks! then i can just burn out cd's from the iso! (it is a dvd iso but i just have a cd-writer)
