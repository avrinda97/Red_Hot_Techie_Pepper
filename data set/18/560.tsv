2012-04-20T10:27:00.000Z	Zenger		Hi guys, accidentally did sudo chmod 777 /
2012-04-20T10:27:00.000Z	Zenger		it yelled privs open and so one
2012-04-20T10:27:00.000Z	Zenger		tried to do chmod 755
2012-04-20T10:27:00.000Z	Zenger		locked the whole pc down :D
2012-04-20T10:28:00.000Z	Zenger		What would be the correct chmod to the whole system folder ?
2012-04-20T10:28:00.000Z	jesfre	Zenger	have you tried Googling the fix?
2012-04-20T10:28:00.000Z	Zenger	jesfre	now I'm a moron.
2012-04-20T10:29:00.000Z	Zenger	jesfre	I'm in a search just now , but tried to ask you guys too
2012-04-20T10:31:00.000Z	Zenger	jesfre	Still , google doesn't seem to help me a lot , in fact besides "chomd 777 chmod" I have no ideea what to search for  :D
2012-04-20T10:38:00.000Z	Zenger	jesfre	I'm not sure
2012-04-20T10:38:00.000Z	Zenger	jesfre	I gave 777 to whole /
2012-04-20T10:38:00.000Z	Zenger	jesfre	the I gave it 755 /
2012-04-20T10:39:00.000Z	jesfre	Zenger	uhhh.... I have no idea. :x
2012-04-20T10:41:00.000Z	Zenger	jesfre	yes, but then the pc yells at me , because I have writing privs. It drives me nuts
2012-04-20T10:43:00.000Z	Zenger	jesfre	I assume I'd have to bash to 777 and then just use the default user as root. I don't want to install because I have some data that is located on the same drive as ubuntu and on formating I would loose everything (
2012-04-20T10:54:00.000Z	Zenger	jesfre	I'm in a lot of pain now :( , now somehow I've managed to do 766 to the chmod binary , now it won't change the priveleges at all :( I'm screwed :D
2012-04-20T10:58:00.000Z	Zenger	jesfre	1 moment gonna check that.
2012-04-20T11:02:00.000Z	Zenger	jesfre	god I hate doing reinstall :( , but I'm gonna have to do it :(
