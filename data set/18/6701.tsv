2008-06-24T16:19:00.000Z	Bodsda	Danish989	netstat -- i dont really understand your question, you pick one of the 3 options then click the 'netstat' button
2008-06-24T16:20:00.000Z	Bodsda	Danish989	i dont know anything about netstat but the gui application can only show you information depending on one f the 3 options you pick (afaik)

2008-06-24T16:22:00.000Z	Bodsda	Danish989	oh, leemme google it
2008-06-24T16:23:00.000Z	Danish989	Bodsda	already did that mate, and the netstat method came up, and I got how to do that with the terminal
2008-06-24T16:23:00.000Z	Danish989	Bodsda	but the thing is, in ubuntu netstat has a GUI and so I'm just trying to figure out if that will be easier than going through command lines and the terminal
2008-06-24T16:24:00.000Z	Bodsda	Danish989	id stick with cli (its more fun) but im interested aswell so im still googling ;~)
2008-06-24T16:24:00.000Z	Danish989	Bodsda	what's cli? I haven't heard of that phenomenon yet, do go on?
2008-06-24T16:24:00.000Z	Bodsda	Danish989	command line interface
2008-06-24T16:25:00.000Z	Danish989	Bodsda	lol, I feel like such an idiot at the moment
2008-06-24T16:26:00.000Z	Bodsda	Danish989	dont worry, linux is all about feeling stupid ;~)
2008-06-24T16:26:00.000Z	Danish989	Bodsda	lol
2008-06-24T16:30:00.000Z	Bodsda	Danish989	i think your right, netstat is the way to go,.,. i read something about looking for port 1863 (or for some reason the http port 80)
2008-06-24T16:30:00.000Z	Danish989	Bodsda	because port 80 is always open on windows
2008-06-24T16:35:00.000Z	Danish989	Bodsda	cya!
