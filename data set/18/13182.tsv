2008-01-03T05:12:00.000Z	Yv12345vY	Malik__	hardly for Ubuntu, maybe Xubuntu
2008-01-03T05:18:00.000Z	Yv12345vY	Malik__	sorry but I didn't get your problem before
2008-01-03T05:19:00.000Z	Yv12345vY	Malik__	are you having problems partitioning?  I just resized and it worked great
2008-01-03T05:20:00.000Z	Yv12345vY	Malik__	boot into Windows (either one) and check out boot.ini on C:\. It may be hidden though but it'll tell you which installation is what.
2008-01-03T05:21:00.000Z	Yv12345vY	Malik__	you'll have to boot into Windows and look
2008-01-03T05:22:00.000Z	Yv12345vY	Malik__	unless you're able to go to Places and then the C drive and then look from there
2008-01-03T05:23:00.000Z	Yv12345vY	Malik__	and it should say Windows Home and Windows Pro and tell you which one is first and such
2008-01-03T05:24:00.000Z	Yv12345vY	Malik__	that should be first then, what partitions do you see in the installation screen?
