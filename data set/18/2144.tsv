2011-06-25T17:36:00.000Z	Israfel		ok, this shit is getting really weird. I've spent all night on it.
2011-06-25T17:36:00.000Z	Israfel		SD card is magically mounting from fuckign nowhere.
2011-06-25T17:36:00.000Z	Israfel		k
2011-06-25T17:37:00.000Z	Israfel		Considering a billion people have issues with their SD cards mounting as read only, someone would be able to help me do the same.
2011-06-25T17:39:00.000Z	Israfel		How do I find out where my SD card is located in /dev?
2011-06-25T17:40:00.000Z	Israfel		How do I find out where the SD card is mounted when it's mounted?
2011-06-25T17:40:00.000Z	cpunkpunk	Israfel	mount
2011-06-25T17:40:00.000Z	cpunkpunk		tells u what is mounted and where
2011-06-25T17:40:00.000Z	Israfel	cpunkpunk	I used that.. DFoesn't work.
2011-06-25T17:41:00.000Z	Israfel	cpunkpunk	lists a bunch of stuff and none of them are the sd card.
2011-06-25T17:41:00.000Z	cpunkpunk	Israfel	if u type that into a terminal it does tell u what is mounted and where
2011-06-25T17:41:00.000Z	cpunkpunk		'bunch of stuff'
2011-06-25T17:41:00.000Z	cpunkpunk		i guess your card ain't mounted then
2011-06-25T17:41:00.000Z	Israfel	cpunkpunk	It's mounted.
2011-06-25T17:41:00.000Z	cpunkpunk		then it's beyond my knowledge
2011-06-25T17:42:00.000Z	cpunkpunk		afaik mount tells u what and where
2011-06-25T17:42:00.000Z	Israfel	cpunkpunk	I'd like it to not automount, it's mounting anyway and I can't tell where.
2011-06-25T17:42:00.000Z	cpunkpunk	Israfel	do sudo fdisk -l
