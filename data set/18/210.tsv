2012-06-09T11:30:00.000Z	back_homu		are the ubuntu-restricted-extra packages for x64 too?
2012-06-09T11:30:00.000Z	Bibo	back_homu	yes
2012-06-09T11:36:00.000Z	Bibo	back_homu	np :D
2012-06-09T11:39:00.000Z	Bibo	back_homu	an issue with pulse audio probably
2012-06-09T11:48:00.000Z	Bibo	back_homu	well if it's not working for firefox as well, then it's a problem with the flash plugin.
2012-06-09T11:51:00.000Z	Bibo	back_homu	adobe flash download page might help, http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/
2012-06-09T12:01:00.000Z	back_homu	Bibo	if somebody else comes with the same problem, redirect them to the download site and tell them to download other versions; the .apt file. it should work.
2012-06-09T12:02:00.000Z	Bibo	back_homu	Glad it worked :)
2012-06-09T12:20:00.000Z	Bibo	back_homu	yep
2012-06-09T12:21:00.000Z	Bibo	back_homu	yeah, but you can reinstall it through the ubuntu software center
2012-06-09T12:22:00.000Z	Bibo	back_homu	I dont' think so, I just know that the system doesn't like it when you have them both open.
2012-06-09T12:29:00.000Z	Bibo	back_homu	Well, KDE has a polished look to it, and many users find it similar to Windows. Gnome Shell is completely unique and may remind you of an Android tablet (it works really well for touchpads, but is annoying to use with a mouse imo). XFCE is very much like Gnome 2 now, and is very lightweight, and even has its own built in compositor. Unity is umm...slow, and odd, and annoying (this is just my opinion anyways).
2012-06-09T12:33:00.000Z	Bibo	back_homu	which one are you referring to?
2012-06-09T12:34:00.000Z	Bibo	back_homu	it's like the windows taskbar
2012-06-09T12:35:00.000Z	Bibo	back_homu	Gnome
2012-06-09T12:36:00.000Z	Bibo	back_homu	in the new ubuntus it's called gnome shell
2012-06-09T12:37:00.000Z	Bibo	back_homu	you can install it from the software center (or the sudo apt-get install gnome-shell command) then logout and click on the gear icon next to your user name then click on the different desktop environment
2012-06-09T12:54:00.000Z	Bibo	back_homu	It sucks for minecraft, otherwise it works fine
