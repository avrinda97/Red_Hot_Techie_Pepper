2009-10-30T05:52:00.000Z	Recursive		I'm upgrading to Karmic; in the process, it gave me a list of packages that are no longer supported. Some of these, like gcc 4.3, I'm guessing are due to newer versions' availability. Is that the case for all of them? Or is Canonical dropping support for major functionality?
2009-10-30T05:52:00.000Z	dooglus	Recursive	they're just all packages you no longer need.
2009-10-30T05:53:00.000Z	dooglus	Recursive	they're stuff that 'apt-get autoremove' would remove if you ran it
2009-10-30T05:53:00.000Z	Recursive	dooglus	OK thanks
2009-10-30T06:00:00.000Z	dooglus	Recursive	no.  if you're using bittorrent, you'll be downloading the whole ISO
2009-10-30T06:00:00.000Z	dooglus	Recursive	you could use the update-manager to upgrade your existing install, but it won't use bittorrent to do so
2009-10-30T06:01:00.000Z	Recursive	dooglus	are they going to support this at some point? It wants to download 1.6 GB of packages and the Ubuntu servers are soooo sloooow.
2009-10-30T06:01:00.000Z	dooglus	Recursive	go to 'software sources' and tell if to pick the 'best server'.  it'll find a non-ubuntu one that's faster.
2009-10-30T06:02:00.000Z	dooglus	Recursive	or just wait 24h and the ubuntu servers will be faster again
2009-10-30T06:02:00.000Z	Recursive	dooglus	thanks for the tip about "best server", that should help
2009-10-30T06:07:00.000Z	dooglus	Recursive	you're very welcome
2009-10-30T06:07:00.000Z	dooglus	Recursive	that server may be a little behind the *.ubuntu.com ones, but it's worth it for the extra speed
2009-10-30T06:16:00.000Z	Recursive	dooglus	there are many different DE's out there
2009-10-30T06:16:00.000Z	dooglus	Recursive	I know, but which is fastest?
2009-10-30T06:16:00.000Z	dooglus	Recursive	on a low RAM box
2009-10-30T06:18:00.000Z	Recursive	dooglus	go with something like openbox or something like that
2009-10-30T06:18:00.000Z	Recursive	dooglus	I personally like LXDE
2009-10-30T06:19:00.000Z	Recursive	dooglus	it's not completely barebones, it has the minimum features you expect without bloat
