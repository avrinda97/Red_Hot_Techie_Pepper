2006-04-17T09:19:00.000Z	whyvas		this is before you boot...
2006-04-17T09:20:00.000Z	whyvas		if you have ubuntu it normally says hit esc to see the grub menu
2006-04-17T09:21:00.000Z	whyvas		not sure if ppc uses grub
2006-04-17T09:21:00.000Z	whyvas		the solution to that would be to buy a real computer and not an overpriced piece of eye candy
2006-04-17T09:23:00.000Z	whyvas		still, check it to make sure
2006-04-17T09:23:00.000Z	whyvas		when you boot off the cd, there's an option in that menu
2006-04-17T09:24:00.000Z	whyvas		you can with the dapper disc, don't know about the breezy one
2006-04-17T09:25:00.000Z	whyvas		really cool stuff
2006-04-17T09:25:00.000Z	whyvas		you need dapper though
2006-04-17T09:25:00.000Z	freakabcd	whyvas	no. aiglx+compiz is even sweeter .. works on a damn crappy i810 !!
2006-04-17T09:26:00.000Z	freakabcd	whyvas	and you're using xgl?
2006-04-17T09:27:00.000Z	freakabcd	whyvas	dude.. seriously, try the aiglx+compiz route. its much smoother, video playback is fast, glxgears and other gl stuff shows up, etc.
2006-04-17T09:27:00.000Z	freakabcd	whyvas	because you used xgl on that i925
2006-04-17T09:32:00.000Z	freakabcd	whyvas	no you don;t
2006-04-17T09:34:00.000Z	freakabcd	whyvas	ooii.. on this 855gm crap aiglx is the only thing usable.
2006-04-17T09:36:00.000Z	freakabcd	whyvas	what if he can;t open up the box?
2006-04-17T09:37:00.000Z	whyvas	freakabcd	then he shouldn't be using linux
