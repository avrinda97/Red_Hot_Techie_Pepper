2005-03-25T16:16:00.000Z	tritium	universal	ignore that foul language.  Sorry he said that
2005-04-07T15:51:00.000Z	tritium	universal	what are you trying to do?
2005-04-08T07:26:00.000Z	tritium	universal	definitely
2005-04-08T07:31:00.000Z	tritium	universal	you can, but then you'll change the md5sum, and you'll have to read the top of your xorg.conf
2005-04-08T07:32:00.000Z	universal	tritium	and its not good when changing the mdd5sum?
2005-04-08T07:33:00.000Z	tritium	universal	as randabis put it, handy tools like dpkg-reconfigure and nvidia-glx-config won't work if  the md5sum is not correct
2005-04-08T07:34:00.000Z	universal	tritium	and were can i change the md5sum?
2005-04-08T07:36:00.000Z	tritium	universal	do you see the info at the top of /etc/X11/xorg.conf regarding md5sums?
2005-04-08T07:37:00.000Z	tritium	universal	you don't have to paste it
2005-04-08T07:38:00.000Z	universal	tritium	does it say something about the md5sum?
2005-04-08T07:38:00.000Z	tritium	universal	yes, you can even see that it does in what you pasted above ;)
2005-04-08T07:39:00.000Z	universal	tritium	ok, so when i have changed something in the conf. then i just have to cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.custom
2005-04-08T07:40:00.000Z	tritium	universal	you got it, buddy ;)
2005-05-13T10:29:00.000Z	tritium	universal	no, not if you're using the binary nvidia drivers
2005-05-13T10:30:00.000Z	tritium	universal	have you followed this: http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/BinaryDriverHowto ?
