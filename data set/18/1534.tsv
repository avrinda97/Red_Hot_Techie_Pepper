2011-01-27T15:08:00.000Z	babymammothlives		can ANYONE change their ip at will here via terminal?
2011-01-27T15:08:00.000Z	babymammothlives		if so..how do you do it
2011-01-27T15:08:00.000Z	sacarlson	babymammothlives	I created a script to do it so yes
2011-01-27T15:09:00.000Z	babymammothlives		so which one will do it?
2011-01-27T15:09:00.000Z	sacarlson	babymammothlives	Delphius_ problem I have with just ifconfig is that it is overriden from network-manager so my script stops that
2011-01-27T15:12:00.000Z	babymammothlives	sacarlson	does that script give me a new ip?
2011-01-27T15:13:00.000Z	babymammothlives		why so, ryan?
2011-01-27T15:15:00.000Z	babymammothlives		dont you have to restart to see the p ackage name?
2011-01-27T15:15:00.000Z	babymammothlives		im sure there's an easier way
2011-01-27T15:16:00.000Z	sacarlson	babymammothlives	yes it will give you a new ip but only until you reboot,  then it will return to your default setings
2011-01-27T15:17:00.000Z	babymammothlives	sacarlson	so i've got to input the ip i wont or it does it automatically? Can i get rid of dhcp3 logs and force it to give me a new one?
2011-01-27T15:18:00.000Z	babymammothlives		i read somewhere taht some guy did that
2011-01-27T15:19:00.000Z	sacarlson	babymammothlives	you need to modify the script to setup the static ip and gateway address you want
2011-01-27T15:19:00.000Z	sacarlson	babymammothlives	it bypasses dhcp
2011-01-27T15:19:00.000Z	babymammothlives	sacarlson	that seems like a pretty awesome script
2011-01-27T15:22:00.000Z	babymammothlives		To remove old kernel versions, open up Synaptic Package Manager, found in the System > Administration menu
2011-01-27T15:24:00.000Z	sacarlson	babymammothlives	I added comments just for you: http://paste.ubuntu.com/558921/
