2006-08-01T15:00:00.000Z	snk00sj_		hi i am looking for a good guide on setting permissions related to an apache webserver
2006-08-01T15:00:00.000Z	snk00sj_		can anyone point me in the good direction ?
2006-08-01T15:01:00.000Z	longwave	snk00sj_	can't get much better than the apache documentation: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/
2006-08-01T15:03:00.000Z	snk00sj_	longwave	: thats the apache configuration documentation
2006-08-01T15:04:00.000Z	longwave	snk00sj_	i don't understand what you mean by "permissions related to apache", then
2006-08-01T15:05:00.000Z	longwave	snk00sj_	apache usually runs as nobody, then it depends how you're going to let users publish documents (ftp uploads? webdav? some kind of php/perl/python script?)
2006-08-01T15:05:00.000Z	longwave	snk00sj_	or if not nobody, then at least a user with very few permissions
2006-08-01T15:06:00.000Z	longwave	snk00sj_	the general way is to let apache run as whatever user it wants, then make the documents under the web root world-readable so any user (including the one running apache) can read the files
2006-08-01T15:07:00.000Z	longwave	snk00sj_	then you can use standard unix users/groups to allow write permissions to the files and folders you want people to upload to
2006-08-01T15:09:00.000Z	snk00sj_	longwave	ok, but now my apache is running as user nobody, and i am editing/adding documents as userX
2006-08-01T15:10:00.000Z	longwave	snk00sj_	no, just make sure they are world readable (in the drwxrwxrwx permissions, that's the last "r")
2006-08-01T15:10:00.000Z	longwave	snk00sj_	setting that bit means that any user can read the files, including apache
2006-08-01T15:12:00.000Z	longwave	snk00sj_	yes, that's the best way
2006-08-01T15:12:00.000Z	longwave	snk00sj_	you want apache to run as nobody so it has no write permissions to anything, that way if there is a security bug in apache nobody can overwrite your files
2006-08-01T15:21:00.000Z	longwave	snk00sj_	i dont know, but little things like that are making me want to switch back from compiz to metacity
2006-08-01T15:22:00.000Z	longwave	snk00sj_	similarly, there's no keyboard shortcuts that i know of for things like maximise in compiz
2006-08-01T15:24:00.000Z	snk00sj_	longwave	do you want to switch email adresses so we can let eachother know once we found out ?
2006-08-01T15:24:00.000Z	longwave	snk00sj_	as far as i know they are not implemented yet, we just have to wait for a newer compiz to come out
