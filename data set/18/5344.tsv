2008-11-11T02:10:00.000Z	`r0ot		did any one know how to fix the panel ?
2008-11-11T02:11:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	`r0ot	its a good idea to ask from time to time again. but please repeat the question/problem too.
2008-11-11T02:17:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	`r0ot	do you find errors in /var/log/syslog regarding bonobo?
2008-11-11T02:18:00.000Z	`r0ot	zsquareplusc	i don't this so but i can open it if u want that
2008-11-11T02:19:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	`r0ot	there is a view for system messages in the system->admin menu
2008-11-11T02:20:00.000Z	`r0ot	zsquareplusc	I can't use the desktop :(
2008-11-11T02:22:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	`r0ot	but you have a GUI runing? then you could open a terminal or use alt+f2 and run gnome-system-log
2008-11-11T02:22:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	`r0ot	otherwise you can look at the files with less /var/log/syslog etc
2008-11-11T02:25:00.000Z	`r0ot	zsquareplusc	I try but i find more command and i don't know how i can do it :(
2008-11-11T02:36:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	`r0ot	last resort, delete the hidden (dot) files in your home folder. this will make you loose all your settings and start again with defaults. maybe backup them first (or rename)
2008-11-11T02:37:00.000Z	`r0ot	zsquareplusc	i ahe two users the main one have the errors in gnome-panel and number two run fine, so i post my errors message, but i don't know how to fix it ?
2008-11-11T02:38:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	`r0ot	yes, i saw your pasteed message, i dont knwo how to fix that. but as you say an other use is fine, it indicates that its a users settings problem. so removing the settings files should help
2008-11-11T02:39:00.000Z	`r0ot	zsquareplusc	all of them or .conf and ,gnome only ?
2008-11-11T02:40:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	`r0ot	i dont know. maybe all the .gnome folders
2008-11-11T02:45:00.000Z	`r0ot	zsquareplusc	it's the same :(
2008-11-11T02:46:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	`r0ot	there are a lot more folders with settings. move the others too.
2008-11-11T02:47:00.000Z	`r0ot	zsquareplusc	plese names :$
2008-11-11T02:48:00.000Z	zsquareplusc	`r0ot	nope i dont start telling random names.. maybe mkdir ~/backup; mv -r .* ~/backup
