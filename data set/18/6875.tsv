2008-04-01T05:52:00.000Z	anteaya	amenado	thanks will try
2008-04-01T06:08:00.000Z	anteaya	amenado	I followed your instructions which got the PATH in the $PATH, but the gem is still not working for me http://pastie.caboo.se/173507
2008-04-01T06:09:00.000Z	anteaya	amenado	a realize the gems is not an ubuntu area of expertise
2008-04-01T06:09:00.000Z	anteaya	amenado	but i though i would get back to you
2008-04-01T06:09:00.000Z	anteaya	amenado	yes that is true

2008-07-03T05:14:00.000Z	anteaya	amenado	hmmm i was wondering about making an iso of my system for a back up
2008-07-03T05:16:00.000Z	anteaya	amenado	or are you suggesting that I don't overwrite what I have running and just cut some more space and install hardy in the new space?
2008-07-03T05:16:00.000Z	anteaya	amenado	I hadn't thought of that actually, that may be better
2008-07-03T05:18:00.000Z	anteaya	amenado	okay, that would leave me triple booted but that actually sounds like it may be the safest bet.  Link for instruction on creating a new partition?
