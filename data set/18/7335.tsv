2010-08-29T10:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	diva	you need a partition to be / and format it ext4
2010-08-29T10:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	diva	you need a partition defined for /  make it at least 6gb to be comfortable
2010-08-29T10:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	diva	set sda5 as mounted as '/'
2010-08-29T10:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	diva	and mark it for formatting so its all clear and ready to go. The installer wil now see that a root partition is defined and allow the install to run
2010-08-29T10:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	diva	you have defined a 40Gb swap...
2010-08-29T10:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	diva	look at the image, you have setup a 40Gb swap
2010-08-29T10:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	diva	4Gb
2010-08-29T10:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	diva	not 40Gb
2010-08-29T10:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	diva	unless you have 40Gb ram and REALLY need suspend...
2010-08-29T10:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	diva	delete the swap partition and the ext4 partition and reset them up. have a 4gb swap space then set the rest of the space for / and formatted ext4
2010-08-29T12:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	diva	if you have a root terminal you don't need sudo. Do you log in as root or something?
2010-08-29T12:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	diva	you will need to make the mount point. It is not mounts job to make the mount point. And please don't log on as root
2010-08-29T12:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	diva	no output means it worked, no news is good news :)
2010-08-29T12:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	diva	don't do that. Use pastebin for multiple lines so you don't scroll the crap out of the channel
2010-08-29T12:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	diva	I'm no good with grub. Never had an issue with it.
2010-08-29T12:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	diva	have you asked in #grub ?
