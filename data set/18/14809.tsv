2005-06-11T14:46:00.000Z	HappyFool	Kyynara	at a guess either the code has a bug, or you're missing some header files or something
2005-06-11T14:47:00.000Z	HappyFool	Kyynara	doesn't the app come with a 'configure' script ?
2005-06-11T14:48:00.000Z	Kyynara	HappyFool	it comes with a makefile, if that's what you are referring to?
2005-06-11T14:48:00.000Z	HappyFool	Kyynara	no, a file called 'configure'
2005-06-11T14:49:00.000Z	HappyFool	Kyynara	ah. then you need to read the docs to find out what libraries need to be installed for the compile
2005-06-11T14:49:00.000Z	HappyFool	Kyynara	and then install -dev packages for those libraries
2005-06-11T14:50:00.000Z	HappyFool	Kyynara	but it should've failed when trying to include files not present
2005-06-11T14:51:00.000Z	Kyynara	HappyFool	it did fail, or so I think atleast...
2005-06-11T14:52:00.000Z	HappyFool	Kyynara	and you commented out the #include line ? ;)
2005-06-24T13:40:00.000Z	HappyFool	Kyynara	you probably need a linux-headers-* package, like linux-headers-386 or -686 or -k7 -- depending on your kernel image
2005-06-24T13:40:00.000Z	Kyynara	HappyFool	thanks
2005-06-24T13:48:00.000Z	Kyynara	HappyFool	it didn't work with the header files...
2005-06-24T13:49:00.000Z	HappyFool	Kyynara	what does the output of 'uname -r' say ?
2005-06-24T13:50:00.000Z	HappyFool	Kyynara	and what headers package did you install ?
2005-06-24T13:51:00.000Z	HappyFool	Kyynara	hrm
2005-06-24T13:51:00.000Z	Kyynara	HappyFool	you may specify the kernel source path with the
2005-06-24T13:53:00.000Z	HappyFool	Kyynara	hmm. just a moment
2005-06-24T14:01:00.000Z	HappyFool	Kyynara	let's try this: --kernel-source-path=/lib/modules/2.6.10-5-386/build
