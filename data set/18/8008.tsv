2007-10-14T12:05:00.000Z	n08l3		i am trying to install the intel 3945 driver
2007-10-14T12:06:00.000Z	n08l3		and as per the docs i need to run a file called .load
2007-10-14T12:06:00.000Z	n08l3		but that gives me syntax error

2007-10-14T12:09:00.000Z	jotil	n08l3	intel 3945 should be auto detected
2007-10-14T12:09:00.000Z	n08l3	jotil	it did auto detect it, but it was just been random, sometimes it just sits there not connecting the wireless and the wireless card light kept flashing like crazy
2007-10-14T12:10:00.000Z	n08l3		but when it used to work yesterday the light was solid
2007-10-14T12:10:00.000Z	n08l3		so i thought to rebuild the driver
2007-10-14T12:11:00.000Z	jotil	n08l3	i don't think you need to rebuild the driver yet? maybe you can diagnose the problem first?
2007-10-14T12:11:00.000Z	n08l3		I am following this tutorial http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=140085&page=1
2007-10-14T12:11:00.000Z	n08l3	jotil	my friend, i already did as per as the page,now all i need to do is to load it
2007-10-14T12:12:00.000Z	n08l3		so basically i am right now without driver for my card
2007-10-14T12:13:00.000Z	jotil	n08l3	and you are using feisty?
2007-10-14T12:13:00.000Z	n08l3	jotil	 I am using gutsy
2007-10-14T12:15:00.000Z	jotil		oh man, i haven't used that yet. sorry. but i think you *need not* go through all this trouble. gutsy *must* support 3945.
2007-10-14T12:16:00.000Z	n08l3	jotil	i got it working right out of box, but occasionally it won't respond as it is supposed to
