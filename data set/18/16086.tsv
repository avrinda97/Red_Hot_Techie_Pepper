2007-04-07T15:37:00.000Z	stutsman		I get this error when trying to sudo apt-get install filezilla:
2007-04-07T15:37:00.000Z	stutsman		 Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (11 Resource temporarily unavailable)
2007-04-07T15:37:00.000Z	stutsman		E: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), is another process using it?
2007-04-07T15:37:00.000Z	stutsman		Anyone know what that means or how to fix it?
2007-04-07T15:37:00.000Z	stutsman		ahhhh
2007-04-07T15:37:00.000Z	stutsman		wait, now it says it can't find file filezilla
2007-04-07T15:39:00.000Z	stutsman		I get the same error for both
2007-04-07T15:40:00.000Z	stutsman		I have that repository selected
2007-04-07T15:40:00.000Z	Xenguy	stutsman	I see that filezilla is packaged for Ubuntu
2007-04-07T15:40:00.000Z	Xenguy	stutsman	FWIW
2007-04-08T16:24:00.000Z	Xenguy	stutsman	I'm running dapper - it is in one of the standard (i.e. not backport) repos
2007-04-08T16:30:00.000Z	Xenguy	stutsman	once you know to use synaptic or aptitude or apt-get, then installation becomes *more* convenient
2007-04-08T16:30:00.000Z	Xenguy	stutsman	sudo apt-get install vsftpd
2007-04-08T16:31:00.000Z	Xenguy	stutsman	if that doesn't work, then do: /msg ubotu repos
2007-04-08T16:33:00.000Z	Xenguy	stutsman	use the command-line for now, and you probably want to read the man page, and configure first before starting the service
2007-04-08T16:34:00.000Z	Xenguy	stutsman	unfortunately, to run a service like FTP requires some reading/configuration
2007-04-08T16:36:00.000Z	Xenguy	stutsman	to start the service (once it is configured!) you would do something like:  /etc/init.d/vsftpd start
2007-04-08T16:36:00.000Z	Xenguy	stutsman	sudo
