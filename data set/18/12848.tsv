2006-05-28T11:34:00.000Z	noiesmo	SH-ubuntu	are you using vi or nano
2006-05-28T11:36:00.000Z	noiesmo	SH-ubuntu	for vi you press esc then shift : then wq easiler to do nano then its ctrl+x
2006-05-28T11:36:00.000Z	noiesmo	SH-ubuntu	you need to push : key and wq to write and quit
2006-05-28T11:37:00.000Z	noiesmo	SH-ubuntu	do sudo nano /path/to/file then youy can save with ctrl+x
2006-05-28T11:38:00.000Z	noiesmo	SH-ubuntu	nano is a much easier edit to use
2006-05-28T11:38:00.000Z	noiesmo	SH-ubuntu	wq stands for write file and quit
2006-05-28T11:40:00.000Z	noiesmo	SH-ubuntu	ok push esc then shift + : key
2006-05-28T11:41:00.000Z	noiesmo	SH-ubuntu	 check this http://math.la.asu.edu/vi_tutorial/vi7.html
2006-05-28T11:42:00.000Z	noiesmo	SH-ubuntu	use nano instead of vi
2006-05-28T11:42:00.000Z	noiesmo	SH-ubuntu	any tutorial you follow just replace vi with nano then at bottom of screen it tells you how to save exit etc
2006-05-28T11:43:00.000Z	noiesmo	SH-ubuntu	you need to restart X
2006-05-28T11:43:00.000Z	noiesmo	SH-ubuntu	this can be done by pushing ctrl+alt+backspace
2006-05-28T11:47:00.000Z	noiesmo	SH-ubuntu	your hz is dependant on the resolution depending on the driver used for video
2006-05-28T11:47:00.000Z	noiesmo	SH-ubuntu	on my nvidia system I can have 1260xblah at 60hz and then 1152x Blah at 75Hz it also depends on monitor
2006-05-28T11:48:00.000Z	noiesmo	SH-ubuntu	here;s link to my config I have nvidia 660gt and benq 17: monitor
