2008-03-03T14:20:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Ububegin	you've tried the standard way, in the menu ( System->Preferences->Screen Resolution) ?
2008-03-03T14:21:00.000Z	Ububegin	prince_jammys	Oh, thanks... for that quickie tip
2008-03-03T15:13:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Ububegin	i think you're talking about a "dock" -- you can look up avant window navigator (awn) or kiba-dock, as mentioned above.  neither of them are available though apt, though.  you can also look around in apt to see if there's something that suits you
2008-03-03T15:24:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Ububegin	yeah, that happens
2008-03-07T09:10:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Ububegin	awn is not available through apt, as far as i know
