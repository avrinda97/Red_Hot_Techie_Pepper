2007-04-26T15:51:00.000Z	JJNova		Hey guys, is there a firewall default for Feisty ?
2007-04-26T15:52:00.000Z	therealnanotube	JJNova	yea, firewall default that is "allow everything". :)
2007-04-26T15:52:00.000Z	therealnanotube	JJNova	if you want the firewall to actually block stuff, edit the iptables config. (there are tutorials and stuff all over)
2007-04-26T15:53:00.000Z	therealnanotube	JJNova	ah, well, you could run "sudo iptables --list" to list all your rules, to make sure that nothing is being blocked.
2007-04-26T15:53:00.000Z	therealnanotube	JJNova	but that's unlikely, if you didn't enable it yourself.
2007-04-26T15:55:00.000Z	therealnanotube	JJNova	what happens if you run "telnet smtp.yourisp.com 25" ?
2007-04-26T15:56:00.000Z	therealnanotube	JJNova	you don't need to open port 25. when sending email, you are connecting to another server's port 25.
2007-04-26T15:56:00.000Z	therealnanotube	JJNova	so, then, your smtp mailserver is down
2007-04-26T15:57:00.000Z	therealnanotube	JJNova	what's your mail server, i can try telnetting to it
2007-04-26T15:57:00.000Z	JJNova	therealnanotube	 both of them? Immediately after updating? Perhaps. Just seems unlikely
2007-04-26T15:57:00.000Z	therealnanotube	JJNova	gamecootie doesn't allow connect on port 25
2007-04-26T15:58:00.000Z	therealnanotube	JJNova	maybe they are running TLS, and do smtp on port 587 instead?
2007-04-26T15:58:00.000Z	JJNova	therealnanotube	 linxeh connected to it with no problem
2007-04-26T15:58:00.000Z	JJNova	therealnanotube	 So I guess you and I can't do it.
2007-04-26T15:58:00.000Z	therealnanotube	JJNova	hehe. what's your ISP?
2007-04-26T15:58:00.000Z	JJNova	therealnanotube	 Everyone else seems to
2007-04-26T15:59:00.000Z	therealnanotube	JJNova	i'm on comcast. maybe it's comcast's fault? :)
2007-04-26T15:59:00.000Z	therealnanotube	JJNova	what's your other smtp server?
