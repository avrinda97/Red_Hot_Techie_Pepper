2007-11-05T12:20:00.000Z	Futsuriai	Not_Sure	I think you can do that by using the java command
2007-11-05T12:20:00.000Z	Futsuriai		Is it a gui java app ?
2007-11-05T12:21:00.000Z	Not_Sure	Futsuriai	Using java command is an option when you operate in console mode. However, I am trying to create an application launcher on gnome panel.
2007-11-05T12:21:00.000Z	Futsuriai	Not_Sure	I mean, is it a gui app, or one which needs to run in terminal?
2007-11-05T12:22:00.000Z	Not_Sure	Futsuriai	This is a GUI application
2007-11-05T12:24:00.000Z	Futsuriai	Not_Sure	hold on let me get an example .class I have somewhere
2007-11-05T12:28:00.000Z	Futsuriai	Not_Sure	ok
2007-11-05T12:28:00.000Z	Futsuriai	Not_Sure	do ' java -cp "PATH" classname [opts]
2007-11-05T12:28:00.000Z	Futsuriai		For your command
2007-11-05T12:29:00.000Z	Futsuriai		You don't need quotes for PATH
2007-11-05T12:30:00.000Z	Futsuriai	Not_Sure	for instance I have for my command : java -cp /home/babu/courses/cs424/  boardgame.Server -p 8123
