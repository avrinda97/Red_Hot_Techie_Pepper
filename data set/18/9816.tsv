2007-03-23T15:52:00.000Z	rasputnik	deadeyes	isn't that a bit insane? how are you going to route if you only have one cable?
2007-03-23T15:54:00.000Z	rasputnik	deadeyes	page up/down
2007-03-23T15:55:00.000Z	deadeyes	rasputnik	it goes to the router
2007-03-23T15:56:00.000Z	rasputnik	deadeyes	don't think you can have an alias on a different subnet to the main ip
2007-03-23T15:56:00.000Z	deadeyes	rasputnik	it goes to the router
2007-03-23T15:57:00.000Z	rasputnik	deadeyes	I heard you the first time. you're still a crazy person.
2007-03-23T15:57:00.000Z	deadeyes	rasputnik	it goes to the router
2007-03-23T15:58:00.000Z	rasputnik	deadeyes	yes. i got it. you can't have eth0:1 on a different subnet to eth0 . it won't work.
2007-03-23T15:58:00.000Z	deadeyes	rasputnik	I already did that I think, at home once
2007-03-23T15:59:00.000Z	deadeyes	rasputnik	well, they have the same subnet
2007-03-23T16:00:00.000Z	rasputnik	deadeyes	now i'm confused - if they have the same subnet mask, they're on the same subnet. if there's only 1 NIC, they're on the same ethernet network.
2007-03-23T16:00:00.000Z	deadeyes	rasputnik	indeed, they are on the same subnet, and the same physical network
2007-03-23T16:01:00.000Z	rasputnik	deadeyes	that's what I mean by subnet.
2007-03-23T16:04:00.000Z	rasputnik	deadeyes	are we on the same page? you said '. I use an alias eth0:0 and eth0
2007-03-23T16:05:00.000Z	deadeyes	rasputnik	well, you said it won't work. but I want to do it quick
2007-03-23T16:05:00.000Z	deadeyes	rasputnik	no you can't but that does not matter
2007-03-23T16:05:00.000Z	rasputnik	deadeyes	sorry you've lost me completely
2007-03-23T16:06:00.000Z	deadeyes	rasputnik	well, at first I tried with one nick (ifconfig eth0:0 172.17.2...)
