2007-05-21T13:26:00.000Z	Ax3		-rwxr-xr-x <---- can anyone tell me the groupings? user group all? confused
2007-05-21T13:27:00.000Z	gdb	Ax3	user, group, other
2007-05-21T13:27:00.000Z	gdb	Ax3	ie; you, your friends, the world
2007-05-21T13:27:00.000Z	gdb		:-D
2007-05-21T13:27:00.000Z	gdb	Ax3	and btw, that is mode 755 that you have displayed in your example
2007-05-21T13:27:00.000Z	Ax3	gdb	so based on that example, user has rwx, group has r-xx, and other has r-x
2007-05-21T13:28:00.000Z	gdb		well, group has r-x, but yes, that's correct
2007-05-21T13:28:00.000Z	Ax3		group = r-x *
2007-05-21T13:28:00.000Z	Ax3		there's a space before user -rwx
2007-05-21T13:28:00.000Z	Ax3		what does that indicate?
2007-05-21T13:28:00.000Z	gdb		The initial - indicates a "plain file" and has nothing to do with the permissions themselves.
2007-05-21T13:28:00.000Z	Ax3		ah
2007-05-21T13:29:00.000Z	gdb		It will be replaced with d for directory, c for block device, p for named pipe, and so on
2007-05-21T13:30:00.000Z	gdb	Ax3	ah, another common one is l for symbolic link
2007-05-21T13:31:00.000Z	Ax3	gdb	roger
2007-05-21T13:33:00.000Z	Ax3	gdb	so if i wanted to give a command to everyone i could just sudo chmod ugo+x /bin/<command>
2007-05-21T13:34:00.000Z	gdb	Ax3	Ah, you can use "a" synonymously with "ugo" so that command can be written as "chmod a+x", but yes, that's more or less correct.
2007-05-21T13:35:00.000Z	Ax3	gdb	ok great :)
