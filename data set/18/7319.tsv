2012-09-21T01:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	_XMENDES	maverick is EOL, not supported and no more updates
2012-09-21T01:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	_XMENDES	have you tried Xubuntu 12.04?
2012-09-21T01:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	_XMENDES	its a dead release, the OS will run but there are zero updates and zero support in any of the ubuntu channels
2012-09-21T01:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	_XMENDES	again, not supported
2012-09-21T01:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	_XMENDES	your release isn't supported. I keep telling you
2012-09-21T01:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	_XMENDES	you aren't supported here
2012-09-21T01:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	_XMENDES	its like calling microsoft support and asking for help with Windows 96
2012-09-21T01:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	_XMENDES	they won't support you
2012-09-21T01:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	_XMENDES	your release is DEAD
2012-09-21T01:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	_XMENDES	in Maverick you won't be able to install much
2012-09-21T01:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	_XMENDES	nor is your release supported here
2012-09-21T01:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	_XMENDES	your release is EOL, so is offtopic. What part of this are you not getting?
2012-09-21T01:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	_XMENDES	maverick is dead, literally zero support anywhere, anytime
2012-09-21T01:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	_XMENDES	doesnt make maverick supported
2012-09-21T01:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	_XMENDES	try Lubuntu 12.04 and I bet you are fine
2012-09-21T01:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	_XMENDES	so is running maverick which moots it
