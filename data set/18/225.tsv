2012-06-06T07:23:00.000Z	frame45		does anyone use the full encryption from the alternate install cd?
2012-06-06T07:25:00.000Z	frame45		is it a good idea to use full encryption on a laptop?
2012-06-06T07:25:00.000Z	Saeryn	frame45	What type of full encryption?
2012-06-06T07:27:00.000Z	frame45	Saeryn	well i just loaded 12.04 on my new laptop but should I encrypt it? I was told you had to use the alternate install cd to fully encrypt the whole system not just /home
2012-06-06T07:28:00.000Z	Saeryn	frame45	You will need to use the alternative install cd to do so, unless you want to make it more complicated.
2012-06-06T07:30:00.000Z	Saeryn	frame45	However unless you're expecting to store sensitive information on your machine, Full Disk Encryption isn't usually needed :) I'd recommend getting more experience with Linux in general before delving into Encryption Schemes.
2012-06-06T07:31:00.000Z	frame45	Saeryn	I know encryption is good if it gets stolen, but what if I break something and it won't boot? is it better just to encrypt /home
2012-06-06T07:32:00.000Z	Saeryn	frame45	A strong enough initial password should protect your information readily enough, if they are indeed sophisticated enough to get through normal authentication measures such encryption usually won't help. However you can encrypt /home if you feel you need to.
2012-06-06T07:35:00.000Z	frame45	Saeryn	thanks, I'm a worst case person, I'm thinking more along the lines of if you pull the drive an mount it to another system.
2012-06-06T07:35:00.000Z	Saeryn	frame45	If you query me I can help you set it up if you'd like :)
2012-06-06T07:38:00.000Z	frame45	Saeryn	I may run the alternate installer just to see how it works. it's a new machine so i'm not too vested at this point yet.
2012-06-06T07:39:00.000Z	Saeryn	frame45	Then go for it definitely :)
2012-06-06T07:39:00.000Z	frame45	Saeryn	what about btrfs? have you tried it yet?
2012-06-06T07:39:00.000Z	Saeryn	frame45	No I have no, I stick to Ext4 for partitions other than /boot and swap.
2012-06-06T07:40:00.000Z	frame45	Saeryn	I made one partition for swap one for / and one for /home. Is it better to make /boot it's own?
2012-06-06T07:41:00.000Z	Saeryn	frame45	It depends on your encryption scheme :)
2012-06-06T07:41:00.000Z	Saeryn	frame45	Mine is a little more complex. I use one where /boot is on it's own among other things.
2012-06-06T07:42:00.000Z	frame45	Saeryn	& Dr_Willis: thanks
