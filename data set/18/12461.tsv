2011-04-20T10:43:00.000Z	rob_p	dn4	you get perfect cancelation and theoretically zero radiated emission from the antenna, duh! :)
2011-04-20T10:44:00.000Z	dn4	rob_p	is the antenna a wave and could we even classify such a thing as an antenna ?
2011-04-20T10:44:00.000Z	rob_p	dn4	Only if it's counterpoise exists
2011-04-20T10:45:00.000Z	dn4	rob_p	How do you conclude theoretically zero radiative emissions exist while the wave resonances match each other even with the interfacing?
2011-04-20T10:45:00.000Z	rob_p	dn4	but even then, the rules only apply (loosly) to conventional physics.
2011-04-20T10:46:00.000Z	rob_p	dn4	How do I conclude... it's just a, "feeling!"
2011-04-20T10:46:00.000Z	rob_p	dn4	Sorry... just talking out my... umm.. ya know! :)
2011-04-20T10:47:00.000Z	dn4	rob_p	ahh well on that note; I believe you are wrong
2011-04-20T10:47:00.000Z	rob_p	dn4	Let's save this for another channel and keep it on Ubuntu support though. :)
2011-04-20T10:48:00.000Z	rob_p	dn4	Yeah, probably.  But you can't prove it!
2011-04-20T10:52:00.000Z	dn4	rob_p	do not doubt that I can or cannot prove anything for I merely asked a question that very few have even asked or know anything about. For you to answer though is noble and my feelings are different that yos
2011-04-20T10:55:00.000Z	rob_p	dn4	Well, if you can prove it, you're far ahead of me or anyone else I know involved in quantum physics.  Anyway, interesting stuff for sure! :)
2011-04-20T10:56:00.000Z	dn4		interesting indeed; now I just wish I had the money and people nessary to answer that question
2011-04-20T10:56:00.000Z	rob_p	dn4	Don't we all, hehe!
2011-04-20T10:56:00.000Z	dn4		assuming we all do is a logical fallacy
2011-04-20T10:57:00.000Z	rob_p	dn4	What...too much credit to human kind?
2011-04-20T10:58:00.000Z	rob_p	dn4	Yeah, you're right.  I should have said, "We all should."
2011-04-20T10:59:00.000Z	dn4	rob_p	that is a bit more idealistic and my fingers smell like tuna fish; FML
