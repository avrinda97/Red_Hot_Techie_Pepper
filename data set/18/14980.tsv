2005-10-29T09:24:00.000Z	nalioth	farruinn	are ipods hfs? i thought they were fat(something)
2005-10-29T09:25:00.000Z	farruinn	nalioth	you may be right, I've never checked
2005-10-29T09:25:00.000Z	nalioth	farruinn	most modern ipods (since the switch to usb) are fat based
2005-10-29T09:32:00.000Z	farruinn	nalioth	if iPods are fat based now Apple does some magic to hide it because when I mount mine on OS X it identifies as hfs+Journaled
2005-10-29T09:32:00.000Z	nalioth	farruinn	how old is your ipod? the older ones are hfs-based
2005-10-29T09:33:00.000Z	farruinn	nalioth	30 GB iPod Photo, came with a USB cable
2005-10-29T09:33:00.000Z	nalioth	farruinn	interesting, must be the newer ones, then

2005-11-05T09:00:00.000Z	farruinn	nalioth	(installing IMB java on ppc)
2005-11-05T09:00:00.000Z	nalioth	farruinn	yes, an older ibm build was used. 1.4.2
2005-11-05T09:01:00.000Z	farruinn	nalioth	ah, so 1.5 is no good, ok
