2011-11-13T05:32:00.000Z	kandinski		what's the deal with gwibber in 11.10?
2011-11-13T05:32:00.000Z	kandinski		it seems to have lost a lot of features
2011-11-13T05:32:00.000Z	silner	kandinski	I've read it's being rewritten, in Vala I was told
2011-11-13T05:32:00.000Z	kandinski		ah
2011-11-13T05:33:00.000Z	kandinski		it's pretty unusable
2011-11-13T05:33:00.000Z	silner	kandinski	it was supposed to make it faster but I'm not convinced myself - I still prefer Choqok
2011-11-13T05:33:00.000Z	kandinski		no man page for gwibber either
2011-11-13T05:34:00.000Z	kandinski	silner	does Choqok inteface with the unified messaging gnome applet?
2011-11-13T05:34:00.000Z	silner	kandinski	Kind of. It works better with Xubuntu and Kubuntu though
2011-11-13T05:35:00.000Z	kandinski	silner	exponential explosion!
2011-11-13T05:35:00.000Z	kandinski		all the combinations of everything with everything...
2011-11-13T05:36:00.000Z	silner	kandinski	in my experience quite a few programs have issues with the new notification area (Turpial and Pino barely work at all with it)
2011-11-13T05:36:00.000Z	kandinski	silner	thanks
2011-11-13T05:37:00.000Z	kandinski		wow wow
2011-11-13T05:37:00.000Z	kandinski		choqok installs quite a bit of kde
2011-11-13T05:37:00.000Z	kandinski		this is my fault fo hitting ok without reading the package list :)
2011-11-13T05:38:00.000Z	silner	kandinski	Yeah I should have warned you about that. It's not as bad as some but it is heavy on the libs
2011-11-13T05:39:00.000Z	kandinski	silner	not your fault at all
