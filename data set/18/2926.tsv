2012-11-03T23:54:00.000Z	b636bc7ca		How do I find the default init level on ubuntu? I'm used to looking in /etc/inittab, but that doesn't exist anymore...
2012-11-03T23:54:00.000Z	jrib	b636bc7ca	why are you looking for it?
2012-11-03T23:54:00.000Z	jrib	b636bc7ca	(ubuntu uses upstart as its init system)
2012-11-03T23:54:00.000Z	b636bc7ca	jrib	Because I want to disable vsftpd in the default runlevel.
2012-11-03T23:57:00.000Z	jrib	b636bc7ca	do you want to know the proper way to disable vsftp?  See the section on manual overrrides in http://upstart.ubuntu.com/cookbook/
2012-11-04T00:01:00.000Z	jrib	b636bc7ca	upstart still handles the old sysv init scripts so there are still runlevel events.  As I understand it though, these are an outdated model; I could be wrong
2012-11-04T00:01:00.000Z	b636bc7ca	jrib	*shrug* At least that documentation answered the real question: the variable DEFAULT_RUNLEVEL in file /etc/init/rc-sysinit.conf
2012-11-04T00:03:00.000Z	b636bc7ca	jrib	It may be "outdated", and perhaps it will stop working at some point in the future, but I still use runlevels quite heavily on my systems; I just couldn't remember what replaced inittab, and my google-fu was failing to come up with the upstart.ubuntu.com URL
2012-11-04T00:03:00.000Z	jrib	b636bc7ca	k, glad you sorted it out
2012-11-04T00:09:00.000Z	jrib	b636bc7ca	I think maybe I was misremembering.  Instead, it's just that runlevels aren't really special in upstart.  They're just events that get emitted and you can use them to start and stop jobs in your script
2012-11-04T00:13:00.000Z	b636bc7ca	jrib	I'm not sure how that's different from the way I've been using runlevels for the past two decades, but great :)
2012-11-04T00:16:00.000Z	jrib	b636bc7ca	well if anything, I think it would make it nicer for you.  Now you can create your own runlevels, you can even create your own new event that you emit instead and have your services watch for.   The only issues with runlevels is if ubuntu decides to stop putting these "start on runlevel" stanzas in the init scripts :) Again, I don't know either way if that's something that's planned
2012-11-04T00:19:00.000Z	b636bc7ca	jrib	well, if they stop supporting it, they stop supporting it - I'm just as screwed either way :) But thanks
2012-11-04T00:20:00.000Z	jrib	b636bc7ca	out of curiousity, what do you use them for?
2012-11-04T00:21:00.000Z	b636bc7ca	jrib	To switch my machine from a server to a desktop
2012-11-04T00:22:00.000Z	b636bc7ca	jrib	For example, when I'm using it as my daily desktop machine, I don't want sshd and ftpd running; when I need to switch it to a server, I don't want X running.
2012-11-04T00:23:00.000Z	jrib	b636bc7ca	I see
2012-11-04T00:24:00.000Z	b636bc7ca	jrib	Thanks again for your help.
