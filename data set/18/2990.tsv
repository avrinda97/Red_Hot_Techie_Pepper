2010-02-26T01:36:00.000Z	Pure	Nitsuga	first one
2010-02-26T01:37:00.000Z	Nitsuga	Pure	it comes with desktop if the filename is ubuntu-desktop ;). The text-only install, but with desktop is ubuntu-alternate. And the non-desktop install is ubuntu-server
2010-02-26T01:37:00.000Z	Pure	Nitsuga	rdesktop
2010-02-26T01:38:00.000Z	Nitsuga	Pure	ohh rdesktop! Yes, it comes with it
2010-02-26T01:38:00.000Z	Nitsuga	Pure	usb device redirection?
2010-02-26T01:40:00.000Z	Nitsuga	Pure	ohh in rdesktop. It is implemented. Let me check the manual
2010-02-26T01:41:00.000Z	Nitsuga	Pure	rdesktop can redirect folders, printers, sound, smart cards and serial ports. I dont know if USB is a part of serial ports
2010-02-26T01:43:00.000Z	Nitsuga	Pure	checked. USB devices are not redirected.
2010-02-26T01:43:00.000Z	Nitsuga	Pure	I didn't know that Windows's terminal server had that feature.
2010-02-26T01:43:00.000Z	Pure	Nitsuga	is it compatible iwth Server 2008 R2?
2010-02-26T01:43:00.000Z	Pure	Nitsuga	niether did I, but I don't use it
2010-02-26T01:44:00.000Z	Nitsuga	Pure	it uses the RDP v4, it can connect to Windows NT 5 and higher. I tried it on Windows Seven and forks flawlessly
2010-02-26T01:44:00.000Z	Nitsuga	Pure	works
2010-02-26T01:47:00.000Z	Nitsuga	Pure	you don't have to install it if you don't want to. You can use it as a live.cd or as live-usb (there is a good livecd to liveusb "converter" i scalled USBuntu liveusb creator)
2010-02-26T01:47:00.000Z	Nitsuga	Pure	you can also install it on you usb using unetbootin.
2010-02-26T01:47:00.000Z	Pure	Nitsuga	I know, but my USB is my only one
2010-02-26T01:48:00.000Z	Nitsuga	Pure	ok, good luck.
