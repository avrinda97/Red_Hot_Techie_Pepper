2012-01-19T23:09:00.000Z	gamerpro2000		ilovemesomeubuntu: create a user, add them to the sudoers file, then disable root, yes
2012-01-19T23:10:00.000Z	zykotick9	gamerpro2000	"add them to the sudoers file" is bad info, add them to the "admin" group is better
2012-01-19T23:11:00.000Z	gamerpro2000	zykotick9	Forgive me.  I'm used to working with an Ubuntu server, not desktop.  I rarely use the actual Ubuntu desktop distro.
2012-01-19T23:16:00.000Z	zykotick9	gamerpro2000	dpkg -i ..
2012-01-19T23:18:00.000Z	gamerpro2000	zykotick9	Not sure how, but for some reason ever since I started using debian, I always think that deb -i is the command, until I try it and rage at myself.
2012-01-19T23:32:00.000Z	gamerpro2000	zykotick9	He's using the proprietary NVidia drivers and those automatically generate a static XOrg.conf
2012-01-19T23:32:00.000Z	zykotick9	gamerpro2000	well not automatically (i don't thing), but after "sudo nvidia-xconfig" perhaps ;) [might have changed, be an ubuntu thing to auto do it]
2012-01-19T23:33:00.000Z	gamerpro2000	zykotick9	Who knows......all I know is that NVidia and Ubuntu have been a thorn in my side since the day I first started playing with the OS ;)
2012-01-19T23:33:00.000Z	zykotick9	gamerpro2000	you haven't tried ATI have you ;)
2012-01-19T23:34:00.000Z	gamerpro2000	zykotick9	Oh, I have ;) .  Its.....uh......fun?
2012-01-19T23:35:00.000Z	gamerpro2000	zykotick9	Ati is fun because you either go with the open source drivers with have better displaying of pretty much anything and handle multi-seat better or you use the proprietary, which look like crappy, but the HDMI sound ACTUALLY works
2012-01-19T23:37:00.000Z	gamerpro2000	zykotick9	Although, I heard that the open source ATI driver now has HDMI sound......I'll have to see it to believe it though.
2012-01-19T23:37:00.000Z	zykotick9	gamerpro2000	"open source ATI driver" is technically incorrect, as it relies on proprietary firmware.  Just saying it's not technically free/open.
2012-01-19T23:39:00.000Z	zykotick9	gamerpro2000	i agree! but Ivoz says that's not possible (using a LiveCD it probably would)
2012-01-19T23:40:00.000Z	gamerpro2000	zykotick9	I'm pretty sure he said earlier he had access to the file system.
2012-01-19T23:57:00.000Z	gamerpro2000	zykotick9	Since when did it start doing that?  I thought it gave you the "radeon" package and the fglrx was the ATI made one?
2012-01-19T23:59:00.000Z	zykotick9	gamerpro2000	NOT installing drivers should give radeaon while "additional drivers" should give fglrx (i think, but i would never use ATI, so can't be sure)
