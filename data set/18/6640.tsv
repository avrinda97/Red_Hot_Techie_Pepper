2008-04-20T07:27:00.000Z	Zeker_		icemanv9, what if I set it up as a firewall?
2008-04-20T07:29:00.000Z	Zeker_		has anyone ever used firewallbuilder on ubuntu?
2008-04-20T07:30:00.000Z	sjovan	Zeker_	i heard that you got a GUI named firestorme or something that is really easy to use. maby you should google it :)
2008-04-20T07:30:00.000Z	sjovan	Zeker_	100% on the fire part atleast
2008-04-20T07:30:00.000Z	Zeker_	sjovan	haha yes I've tried that but somehow it conflicts with iptables
2008-04-20T07:31:00.000Z	sjovan	Zeker_	conflicts? i thought it was a gui to change iptables and stuff
2008-04-20T07:32:00.000Z	Zeker_	sjovan	yes it turns out that it tries to run over iptables and not necessarily configure it
2008-04-20T07:33:00.000Z	Zeker_	sjovan	and I had a lot of trouble installing fwbuilder on ubuntu so I just gave up
2008-04-20T07:33:00.000Z	sjovan	Zeker_	oh, i c. anyways... lissent to jj3666
2008-04-20T07:35:00.000Z	Zeker_	sjovan	indeed I understand what jj3666 is talking about.  But I believe fwbuilder works in conjunction and not OVER iptables
2008-04-20T07:36:00.000Z	sjovan	Zeker_	k, so what's the problem installing it then?
2008-04-20T07:39:00.000Z	Zeker_	sjovan	whenever I tried compiling from the source it would not work or run.  I followed all the instruction on their website.  I finally got it to start up after I found an old installer package (a synaptic package) but then it kept acting buggy so I just removed it and tried using redhat to install fwbuilder.  No luck.  I just suck with linux I guess :P
2008-04-20T07:40:00.000Z	sjovan	Zeker_	so what kinde of error did you get when you tryed to ./configure ?
2008-04-20T07:42:00.000Z	Zeker_	sjovan	uhh it was a long time ago, but I'm sure it had something to do with missing libraries or a "command not found".  it said something was missing, so I tried all the files that had sh or install on them with the ./ command and got no good results.
2008-04-20T07:43:00.000Z	sjovan	Zeker_	i'm shure it got it reason. if you want i can try to help you trough the install. make a channel and we can talk some more. haven't tryed to install that before, but i had some issues like that before :)
2008-04-20T07:44:00.000Z	Zeker_	sjovan	sure thing I can definately appreciate the help!  How do I make a chan?
2008-04-20T07:45:00.000Z	sjovan	Zeker_	/j #andsomechannelname
2008-04-20T07:46:00.000Z	Zeker_	sjovan	ok, it's #operationfirewall
