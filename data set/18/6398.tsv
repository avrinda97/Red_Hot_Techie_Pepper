2008-05-20T03:54:00.000Z	Moduliz0r		Hi, how would I cause a program to shut up and go into the background (so I can put it in rc,local)?
2008-05-20T03:55:00.000Z	Moduliz0r		How can I execute a program/script into the background and make it quiet?
2008-05-20T03:56:00.000Z	Steve-cal	Moduliz0r	You mean run it in the background?  ./script &
2008-05-20T03:56:00.000Z	Moduliz0r	Steve-cal	Yeah, but how do I silence all output?
2008-05-20T03:56:00.000Z	Moduliz0r	Steve-cal	I want to put it in rc.local so I dont want any weird crap coming through
2008-05-20T03:57:00.000Z	Steve-cal	Moduliz0r	Well, you can always send all its stdout and stderr off to La-La Land: ./script &> /dev/nulll &
2008-05-20T03:59:00.000Z	Steve-cal	Moduliz0r	I think erUSUL's syntax only works through a pipe.. have you tried that erUSUL?
2008-05-20T03:59:00.000Z	Moduliz0r	Steve-cal	Will your method make *all* output die?
2008-05-20T04:00:00.000Z	Steve-cal	Moduliz0r	Yes, all stdin and stderr get thrown into cyberspace: /dev/null  :)
2008-05-20T04:01:00.000Z	Steve-cal	Moduliz0r	Huh? It won't hang the bash shell.
2008-05-20T04:04:00.000Z	Steve-cal	Moduliz0r	Yes, and be careful what you put in it because everything is run as root.
2008-05-20T04:05:00.000Z	Steve-cal	Moduliz0r	"su username -c <commands>"
2008-05-20T04:09:00.000Z	Steve-cal	Moduliz0r	If you don't need your script run as root, add it with the "Sessions" program to run on startup.
2008-05-20T04:09:00.000Z	Steve-cal	Moduliz0r	"Sessions" will run the script under the user who logs in.
2008-05-20T04:09:00.000Z	Moduliz0r	Steve-cal	its a server
2008-05-20T04:11:00.000Z	Steve-cal	Moduliz0r	OK, yes I think that should work, try it at the command line to make sure you get everything right.
2008-05-20T04:12:00.000Z	Steve-cal	Moduliz0r	Good deal, hopefully your set to go.
2008-05-20T04:12:00.000Z	Moduliz0r	Steve-cal	thanks
