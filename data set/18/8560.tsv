2007-08-07T13:08:00.000Z	CheeseGardener		I have a quick question. I got 3d chess to work, but whenever I click in the window to move a piece, the screen flickers.  Does anyone know how to fix this?????
2007-08-07T13:08:00.000Z	xstasi	CheeseGardener	either 3dchess bug or the infamous "Random Error Distribution" - does it happen with other OpenGL stuff?
2007-08-07T13:10:00.000Z	CheeseGardener	xstasi	I don't know if it happens with other things.
2007-08-07T13:10:00.000Z	CheeseGardener	xstasi	so far I only have this issue with 3d chess
2007-08-07T13:14:00.000Z	xstasi	CheeseGardener	graphic or text?
2007-08-07T13:14:00.000Z	xstasi	CheeseGardener	remove
2007-08-07T13:15:00.000Z	xstasi	CheeseGardener	apt-get remove
2007-08-07T13:30:00.000Z	xstasi	CheeseGardener	try deborphan
2007-08-07T13:30:00.000Z	xstasi	CheeseGardener	anyway, aptitude tells you if stuff is no longer needed, and often it uninstalls it automatically
2007-08-07T13:31:00.000Z	xstasi	CheeseGardener	yep
2007-08-07T13:32:00.000Z	xstasi	CheeseGardener	anyway
2007-08-07T13:38:00.000Z	xstasi	CheeseGardener	it doesn't say what packages are orphaned, it just says what he thinks you no longer need
2007-08-07T13:39:00.000Z	xstasi	CheeseGardener	definitely not
2007-08-07T13:39:00.000Z	xstasi	CheeseGardener	examine them
2007-08-07T13:40:00.000Z	xstasi	CheeseGardener	it's not
2007-08-07T13:45:00.000Z	xstasi	CheeseGardener	absolutely normal
2007-08-07T13:46:00.000Z	xstasi	CheeseGardener	no
2007-08-07T13:46:00.000Z	xstasi	CheeseGardener	sure, but who remembers?
