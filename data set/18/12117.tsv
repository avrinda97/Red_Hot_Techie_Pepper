2006-05-25T12:40:00.000Z	pavlixxx		tell me, please, why's ubuntu 5.10 still the latest?
2006-05-25T12:41:00.000Z	ompaul	pavlixxx	 dapper was delayed by 6 weeks for extra polish and l10n
2006-05-25T12:41:00.000Z	pavlixxx	ompaul	I didn't know that's possible
2006-05-25T12:41:00.000Z	pavlixxx	ompaul	so it will be released next month?
2006-05-25T12:41:00.000Z	ompaul	pavlixxx	it happend
2006-05-25T12:41:00.000Z	ompaul	pavlixxx	on the 1st
2006-05-25T12:42:00.000Z	pavlixxx	ompaul	so... you tell me to wait.... and not install breezy :-)
2006-05-25T12:43:00.000Z	ompaul	pavlixxx	I said no such thing, you can get dapper at cdimage.ubuntu.com, it is your call if you want stable and can wait until Thursday week fine, if not install 5.10
2006-05-25T12:44:00.000Z	pavlixxx	ompaul	and... this means, that if i upgrade on 1st june... i can consider it stable?
2006-05-25T12:45:00.000Z	ompaul	pavlixxx	perhaps, look at it this way, unstable - beta - release, the release today is 5.10 with a single command line you will be able to upgrade when 6.06 is out, is it your call,
2006-05-25T12:47:00.000Z	pavlixxx	ompaul	single command after editing /etc/sources.list, right?
2006-05-25T12:48:00.000Z	ompaul	pavlixxx	no, a single command that does that for you
2006-05-25T12:50:00.000Z	pavlixxx	ompaul	which one?
2006-05-25T12:50:00.000Z	ompaul	pavlixxx	memory leak on my part
2006-05-25T12:51:00.000Z	pavlixxx	ompaul	I'm used to debian... and I have to edit sources.list if I want something different than what i have
2006-05-25T12:52:00.000Z	ompaul	pavlixxx	you can do things that way but you can also do >>sudo  update-manager -d<<
2006-05-25T12:52:00.000Z	ompaul	pavlixxx	I patched my memory (well tab and a clue got me there :))
2006-05-25T12:54:00.000Z	pavlixxx	ompaul	update-manager ??? cute
