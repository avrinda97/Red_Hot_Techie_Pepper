2007-05-31T16:59:00.000Z	kijjaz		How can I recreate a swap partition for an existing Ubuntu easily and safely?
2007-05-31T16:59:00.000Z	ikonia	kijjaz	why / how did you delete it
2007-05-31T05:00:00.000Z	kijjaz	ikonia	I was having 2 distro (ubuntu and 64 studio) 64 studio installed on 2nd partition, and ubuntu installed on 1st after i installed 64studio
2007-05-31T05:00:00.000Z	kijjaz	ikonia	and i can see there are 2 swap partitions in the harddisk at the end of it.
2007-05-31T05:00:00.000Z	ikonia	kijjaz	great, so you've not got a problem
2007-05-31T05:01:00.000Z	ikonia	kijjaz	you have to swap partitions
2007-05-31T05:01:00.000Z	kijjaz	ikonia	but i deleted a smaller one, now i've got a larger one here. and Ubuntu's still working, but there's a problem:
2007-05-31T05:01:00.000Z	kijjaz	ikonia	I deleted the 64studio partition, one swap partition, and install debian (with no bootloader)
2007-05-31T05:02:00.000Z	kijjaz	ikonia	but when i restart, ubuntu loads ok (at the bootsplash) but then it switch to Terminal.
2007-05-31T05:02:00.000Z	kijjaz	ikonia	and says there's a problem with filesystem, and suggest i should manually correct it.
2007-05-31T05:03:00.000Z	kijjaz	ikonia	but after i type exit, it went on perfectly normal and boot gdm well.
2007-05-31T05:03:00.000Z	ikonia	kijjaz	I'll say it again - what makes you think there is a problem with the swap partition
2007-05-31T05:03:00.000Z	kijjaz	ikonia	I thought the swap i deleted was this distro's swap hahah, i'm quite a noob ya know.
2007-05-31T05:03:00.000Z	kijjaz	ikonia	Because there was 2 swaps.
2007-05-31T05:04:00.000Z	kijjaz	ikonia	and I deleted one that's all.
2007-05-31T05:04:00.000Z	ikonia	kijjaz	I suggest you just re-install to get a clean base as its clear you a.) can't read the error messages properly b.) don't really understand whats going on
2007-05-31T05:04:00.000Z	kijjaz	ikonia	So what's the main problem? The file system? hmm.. how should I correcnt this?
2007-05-31T05:05:00.000Z	kijjaz	ikonia	Hmm a clean base'd do. Okay, thanks mate.
