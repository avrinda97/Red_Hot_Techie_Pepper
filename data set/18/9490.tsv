2007-04-25T09:02:00.000Z	stefg	BloodSkin	it's dead simple, if you just watch out where your botloader goes... so use the alternate install CD
2007-04-25T09:03:00.000Z	BloodSkin	stefg	the thing is, i dont have a cd burner
2007-04-25T09:04:00.000Z	stefg	BloodSkin	oh... you mean install *from* one, nt *to* one ?
2007-04-25T09:06:00.000Z	stefg	BloodSkin	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick applies to to hd's too
2007-04-25T09:10:00.000Z	BloodSkin	stefg	thanks for the link ill check it out
2007-04-25T09:23:00.000Z	BloodSkin	stefg	thats normal. it doesnt check your db untill you tell it to so that it saves bandwidth
2007-04-25T09:25:00.000Z	stefg	BloodSkin	true? If i say 'fetch mail at startup' i'd want the program to do exactly that... stupid behaviour.
2007-04-25T09:26:00.000Z	stefg	BloodSkin	but i don't care... mail-notifier tells me what's there, so i get the mail when i have time to read it. Doesn't bother me too much
