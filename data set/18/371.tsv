2012-03-16T06:38:00.000Z	KBentley57	xpr3ss	what language would you like to learn?
2012-03-16T06:39:00.000Z	KBentley57	xpr3ss	many people say python is easier to learn than c or c++.
2012-03-16T06:40:00.000Z	xpr3ss	KBentley57	man, im in school right now and i honestly hate c++
2012-03-16T06:41:00.000Z	KBentley57	xpr3ss	i agree, ive taught myself almost all the coding i know
2012-03-16T06:41:00.000Z	KBentley57	xpr3ss	have you tried the Sams books?
2012-03-16T06:42:00.000Z	KBentley57	xpr3ss	ISBN 0-672-32711-2, i just recommended that book to one of my students, they're great intro books
2012-03-16T06:42:00.000Z	xpr3ss	KBentley57	have not tried sams books
2012-03-16T06:43:00.000Z	KBentley57	xpr3ss	its c++ of course, but there are many in that series
2012-03-16T06:44:00.000Z	KBentley57	xpr3ss	all you *require* is already installed - gcc.  If you want an IDE, I like netbeans
2012-03-16T06:46:00.000Z	KBentley57	xpr3ss	if you open synaptic, search for netbeans, you can select to install it.  give it a try
2012-03-16T06:50:00.000Z	KBentley57	xpr3ss	there is an ebook i had for that, that was nice.  let me see if i can find it again. one sec
2012-03-16T06:57:00.000Z	xpr3ss	KBentley57	any luck??
2012-03-16T06:58:00.000Z	KBentley57	xpr3ss	still looking
