2005-10-19T06:40:00.000Z	redguy|work	intelikey	not much digging, /me being lazy... dpkg -L <package>; but this lists only packages installed on your system
2005-10-19T06:41:00.000Z	redguy|work	intelikey	erm, s/only packages/only files belonging to packages/
2006-03-20T17:28:00.000Z	redguy|work	intelikey	you have to run it with root priviledges so it can update ld.cache

2006-03-20T17:31:00.000Z	redguy|work	intelikey	and whar does ldconfig -p | grep libproc say ?
2006-03-20T17:36:00.000Z	redguy|work	intelikey	did you paste the errors to some kind of pastebin?
2006-03-20T17:36:00.000Z	intelikey	redguy|work	no just in flood
2006-03-20T17:37:00.000Z	intelikey	redguy|work	you in flood ?
