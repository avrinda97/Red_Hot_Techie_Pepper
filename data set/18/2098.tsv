2010-10-23T13:59:00.000Z	acidflash		how can one change the boot order of services in ubuntu 10.04
2010-10-23T13:59:00.000Z	Gnea	acidflash	what for?
2010-10-23T14:00:00.000Z	acidflash	Gnea	i set ulimits and the file that I want to have a high number of file descriptors loads before the ulimits is loaded (apparently)
2010-10-23T14:00:00.000Z	acidflash	Gnea	so it loads with max 1024 FD's, I want it to load with 1M
2010-10-23T14:01:00.000Z	acidflash	Gnea	doesnt help much, I know how to add a script, I dont know how to paly with the ORDER of scripts
2010-10-23T14:01:00.000Z	acidflash	Gnea	after I restart the program after the full boot completes, i get my 1M FD's
2010-10-23T14:01:00.000Z	acidflash	Gnea	solution, i think is to start that program LAST
2010-10-23T14:02:00.000Z	Gnea	acidflash	I'm not following....
2010-10-23T14:02:00.000Z	acidflash	Gnea	ok let me try and explain in another manner
2010-10-23T14:02:00.000Z	acidflash	Gnea	no
2010-10-23T14:03:00.000Z	Gnea	acidflash	okay, I know what runlevels are
2010-10-23T14:04:00.000Z	acidflash	Gnea	I have a program called "acidflash".. it requires 1M file descriptors, the init script is already there for it, and it takes its file descriptors from the user its runnig on (ie, in ulimits the soft and hard file descriptors are 1M)... "acidflash" loads BEFORE ulimits... how do i change it so that "acidflash" is the last script to load... that way I  get my 1M file descriptors without
2010-10-23T14:04:00.000Z	Gnea	acidflash	well, you could do it by hand using update-rc.d
2010-10-23T14:06:00.000Z	Gnea	acidflash	yeah, you can do it with update-rc.d, but it's going to require that you read the manpage on it and some trial and error
2010-11-03T13:06:00.000Z	Gnea	acidflash	that might not be the correct solution.
2010-11-03T13:06:00.000Z	acidflash	Gnea	often, dpkg or apt will hang during updates
2010-11-03T13:06:00.000Z	Gnea	acidflash	never had that happen
2010-11-03T13:06:00.000Z	acidflash	Gnea	your internet connection is stable
