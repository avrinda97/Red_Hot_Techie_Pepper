2005-10-29T08:31:00.000Z	P8ntKid		How do i see what version of ubuntu i have?
2005-10-29T08:31:00.000Z	jowi	P8ntKid	uname -a will give you the kernel version
2005-10-29T08:32:00.000Z	P8ntKid	jowi	I mean like how do i tell if its hoary or brezy?
2005-10-29T08:32:00.000Z	jowi	P8ntKid	check if the links in /etc/apt/sources.list point to breezy or hoary
2005-10-29T08:33:00.000Z	P8ntKid	jowi	No, i just recently tried to update from hoary to breezy. So i just changed them. And i wanna see if it actually worked. But im not sure becuase when i did the update. It downloaded all the packages but it didnt install them.
2005-10-29T08:34:00.000Z	jowi	P8ntKid	sudo apt-get update, sudo apt-get dist-upgrade : should have upgraded your system.
2005-10-29T08:35:00.000Z	jowi	P8ntKid	you can also open synaptic to see if you got any broken packages that hasnot been installed.
2005-10-29T08:36:00.000Z	jowi	P8ntKid	unfortunatly, i did the breezy upgrade just a few days ago. Openoffice was broken and the install never finished until i totally removed openoffice from the system. unfortunatley, apt does not keep a log of what it is doing!!!
2005-10-29T08:36:00.000Z	jowi	P8ntKid	took me awhile to find that out :-(
2005-10-29T08:37:00.000Z	P8ntKid	jowi	So what should i do?
2005-10-29T08:38:00.000Z	jowi	P8ntKid	"sudo apt-get dist-upgrade" and take note of the last errors.
2005-10-29T08:38:00.000Z	P8ntKid	jowi	 Ok.
2005-10-29T08:39:00.000Z	P8ntKid	jowi	Ill be back in like 10 minuts.
2005-10-29T08:51:00.000Z	P8ntKid	jowi	Ok. Well. Now its installing for some reason. But before it started installing it gave me all these perl errors :/
2005-10-29T08:52:00.000Z	P8ntKid	jowi	And its still giving me lots of perl errors durring the install.
