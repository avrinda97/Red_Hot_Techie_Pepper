2012-08-13T22:00:00.000Z	bobweaver	n00b	 no one is holding a gun to your head are they ?
2012-08-13T22:01:00.000Z	bobweaver	n00b	 do I need to call the police for you ?
2012-08-13T22:03:00.000Z	bobweaver	n00b	I thought that you where in trouble and someone was holding a gun to your head or something telling you that you have to use Ubuntu :)
2012-08-13T22:07:00.000Z	bobweaver	n00b	 is this a printer server ? or desktop?
2012-08-13T22:27:00.000Z	bobweaver	n00b	 printer is wireless or usb ?
2012-08-13T22:31:00.000Z	bobweaver	n00b	 what I do to check printer 1) if usb run lsusb    is it there ? 2) make sure that cupps and printer mods or 3rd party drivers are installed 3) if that is not working run dmesg to see what the kernel sees run lsmod to make sure that mod(drivers) are loaded
