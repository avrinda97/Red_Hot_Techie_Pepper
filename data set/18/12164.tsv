2006-05-20T13:32:00.000Z	Hso		I haven't broken anything on linux.. yet.. but with Windows.. I'm very 'skilled' in that department lol
2006-05-20T13:32:00.000Z	Hso		i'm using a livecd
2006-05-20T13:32:00.000Z	unimatrix9	Hso	there are other livecd's that can do what you want, saving your setttings
2006-05-20T13:33:00.000Z	Hso	unimatrix9	- that's the newer version of ubuntu, right? I was reading up on that
2006-05-20T13:38:00.000Z	unimatrix9	Hso	; buy an cheap lan card...
2006-05-20T13:38:00.000Z	unimatrix9	Hso	; what you have is an nvidia onboard lan?
2006-05-20T13:39:00.000Z	unimatrix9	Hso	open console type mount
2006-05-20T13:39:00.000Z	Hso	unimatrix9	- I have... I originally had one(PCI), but one day... it Just stopped working :( It seems that card was somehow killed.. so, I bought a replacement one.. and that doesn't work, either :( the support team for my mobo things it's a configuration problem... :(
2006-05-20T13:40:00.000Z	Hso	unimatrix9	 - what's 'console' ?
2006-05-20T13:40:00.000Z	unimatrix9	Hso	; is it recognised in bios?
2006-05-20T13:41:00.000Z	Hso	unimatrix9	- I have no idea... I've never looked in the bios for my network card o.O what section would it be in?
2006-05-20T13:41:00.000Z	unimatrix9	Hso	; i mean does it work?
2006-05-20T13:43:00.000Z	unimatrix9	Hso	; but thats not an onboard card, is it?
2006-05-20T13:44:00.000Z	Hso	unimatrix9	 - no, it's not, I've never been able to use the onboard lan, it seems to be impossible.. it's an nforce4 chipset, and It seems alot of people have problems with that :(
2006-05-20T13:45:00.000Z	unimatrix9	Hso	; i would still recommend for you to try an kanotix livecd ...
2006-05-20T13:46:00.000Z	Hso	unimatrix9	 - why do you recommend that? I've tried the livecd of ubuntu and windowsxp on my PC.. neither can access the internet through the new card :(
2006-05-20T13:55:00.000Z	Hso	unimatrix9	- what do you suggest I do if my Kanotix detects the ethernet card but cannot connect to the internet?
2006-05-20T13:55:00.000Z	unimatrix9	Hso	- use the internet wireless setup, its somewhere in menu
