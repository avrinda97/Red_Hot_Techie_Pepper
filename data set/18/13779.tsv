2005-10-31T07:31:00.000Z	mustard5	Demon_stroke	the fstab file is what mounts your linux drives too, so it must have something in it for you to have loaded up linux today.....something in what you are entering in as a command is probably wrong
2005-10-31T07:31:00.000Z	Demon_stroke	mustard5	i typed sudo nano /ect/fstab

2005-10-31T07:36:00.000Z	Demon_stroke	mustard5	sudo nano /etc/fstab
2005-10-31T07:37:00.000Z	mustard5	Demon_stroke	hmmm..well looks like you might have deleted the contents of your fstab
