2010-09-16T18:23:00.000Z	bobstro	Martens1984	 only enough to point you to the samba documentation.
2010-09-16T18:25:00.000Z	Martens1984	bobstro	I gues that won't be enough, I keep getting the next error
2010-09-16T18:26:00.000Z	bobstro	Martens1984	 sorry i can't help more. have you tried samba support? (i'm not sure if they have an irc channel, or just the mailing list)
2010-09-16T18:27:00.000Z	Martens1984	bobstro	does this involve a problem with samba? Im not sure what Lsass does/means
2010-09-16T18:28:00.000Z	bobstro	Martens1984	 aren't you using samba to integrate?
2010-09-16T18:28:00.000Z	bobstro	Martens1984	 i just assumed so
2010-09-16T18:28:00.000Z	Martens1984	bobstro	no, Samba works fine
2010-09-16T18:29:00.000Z	Martens1984	bobstro	I want to loging with my AD accounts
2010-09-16T18:29:00.000Z	bobstro	Martens1984	 i have read of integrating samba on linux into AD, but don't have any experience. but it's all samba, from what i understand.
2010-09-16T18:30:00.000Z	bobstro	Martens1984	 if not samba, how are you trying to integrate linux into AD?
2010-09-16T18:30:00.000Z	Martens1984	bobstro	likewise
2010-09-16T18:32:00.000Z	Martens1984	bobstro	I'm trying to make my Ubuntu machine a member of my working domain
2010-09-16T18:33:00.000Z	bobstro	Martens1984	 and you've seen these sorts of things? http://www.linux.com/archive/feed/40983 (LDAP authentication against AD) ?
2010-09-16T18:33:00.000Z	Martens1984	bobstro	that might just be what i'm looking for
2010-09-16T18:33:00.000Z	bobstro	Martens1984	 this one seems to cover the samba stuff - http://blog.scottlowe.org/2007/01/15/linux-ad-integration-version-4/
2010-09-16T18:34:00.000Z	bobstro	Martens1984	 again though, have not done myself
2010-09-16T18:35:00.000Z	Martens1984	bobstro	I'll read it, try it error it and try it some more
2010-09-16T18:36:00.000Z	bobstro	Martens1984	 good luck. it's something i've wanted to do, but just never got to.
