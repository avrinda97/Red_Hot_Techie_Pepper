2009-07-13T05:22:00.000Z	xiofire		Hey all, Im trying to install a webserver with Ubuntu Server Edition, OpenSSH (I will be installing LAMP later) and after I select OpenSSH Server, I hit continue and get an error at 85% completion. Can anyone help me?
2009-07-13T05:24:00.000Z	Madpilot	xiofire	did you run the 'check this CD' util on the install CD? one of the menu options early in the install process
2009-07-13T05:24:00.000Z	xiofire	Madpilot	no, Im rather new to this.
2009-07-13T05:25:00.000Z	Madpilot	xiofire	run that, it does an integrity check on the install CD.
2009-07-13T05:26:00.000Z	xiofire	Madpilot	where do I find this? Im deep into installation
2009-07-13T05:27:00.000Z	Madpilot	xiofire	I think it's in the very first menu you see after the install CD starts up.
2009-07-13T05:27:00.000Z	xiofire	Madpilot	reboot?
2009-07-13T05:27:00.000Z	Madpilot	xiofire	if the install is failing anyway, you might as well.
2009-07-13T05:49:00.000Z	xiofire	Madpilot	You still here?
2009-07-13T05:49:00.000Z	Madpilot	xiofire	ya - what's up?
2009-07-13T05:52:00.000Z	xiofire	Madpilot	It told me my disk was perfect, so I began the installation process and now its asking me "Please insert the dis labeled: 'Ubuntu -Server 8.04.2 _Hardy Heron_ - Release i386 (20090121.1)' in the drive /cdrom/ and press enter"
2009-07-13T05:52:00.000Z	Madpilot	xiofire	assuming that's the CD you've already got in there, what happens when you hit Enter?
2009-07-13T05:53:00.000Z	xiofire	Madpilot	takes me back to the same screen
2009-07-13T05:54:00.000Z	Madpilot	xiofire	odd. not sure what to suggest, aside from "try a cold reboot & restart the whole install", which is the brute-force option...
2009-07-13T06:13:00.000Z	xiofire	Madpilot	Im now at the stage "software selection" if I do not choose any software, can I download it at a later date?
2009-07-13T06:13:00.000Z	Madpilot	xiofire	of course.
2009-07-13T06:15:00.000Z	xiofire	Madpilot	error again.  "An installation step failed. You can try to run the failing item again from the menu, or skip it and choose something else. The failing step is: Select and install software."
2009-07-13T06:15:00.000Z	Madpilot	xiofire	odd. I've never used the server install, but that doesn't sound right
