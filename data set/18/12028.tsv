2007-05-17T14:32:00.000Z	Enverex		Can anyone see anything wrong with this when trying to use it on a currently mounted ext3 partition? "sudo mount -o remount,umask=0000 /media/Backup1"
2007-05-17T14:32:00.000Z	Pelo	Enverex	I'm not an expert but that line looks to me like you ar trying to mount an already mounted drive
2007-05-17T14:33:00.000Z	Enverex	Pelo	... that's right
2007-05-17T14:33:00.000Z	Pelo	Enverex	  no I mean   mount then remount ,  try unmount then remount
2007-05-17T14:35:00.000Z	Enverex	Pelo	If I unmounted it then I would just "mount" it, you can't remount something that isn't mounted. The whole reason I'm using remount is to avoid having to first unmount it!
2007-05-23T06:31:00.000Z	Pelo	Enverex	 whn you are compiling from source you often need the  -dev package of the dependency
2007-05-23T06:32:00.000Z	Enverex	Pelo	... I'm not compiling anything, I'm trying to watch a damn DVD
2007-05-23T06:32:00.000Z	Pelo	Enverex	 try installing a dev package anyway and while you are in synaptic  reinstall the other one
2007-05-23T06:34:00.000Z	Enverex	Pelo	Unsupprisingly no change
2007-05-23T06:34:00.000Z	Pelo	Enverex	 there is another package needed for dvd
2007-05-23T06:35:00.000Z	Enverex	Pelo	I've installed it, I've installed all of them
2007-05-23T06:36:00.000Z	Pelo	Enverex	 ok then you probably won'T benifit from resintalling and perhaps solving your problem
2007-05-23T06:36:00.000Z	Enverex	Pelo	How can I not benefit from solving my problem, that makes no sense
2007-05-23T06:36:00.000Z	Pelo	Enverex	read again
2007-05-23T06:40:00.000Z	Enverex	Pelo	I have everything installed on there that it recommends
2007-05-23T06:40:00.000Z	Pelo	Enverex	 I am suggesting that you RE-install everything recommended,  and a reboot might not hurt either
2007-05-23T06:43:00.000Z	Pelo	Enverex	 rebooting clears the memory of zombies and everything
2007-05-23T07:08:00.000Z	Enverex	Pelo	It's nothing to do with that, he just set the wrong drive/partiton
