2007-02-25T09:41:00.000Z	phixnay		does anybody know the right way to turn off a computer from the terminal?
2007-02-25T09:41:00.000Z	lakcaj	phixnay	shutdown -h now
2007-02-25T09:41:00.000Z	phixnay	lakcaj	what's the difference between -h and -P?
2007-02-25T09:42:00.000Z	lakcaj	phixnay	man shutdown
2007-02-25T09:42:00.000Z	lakcaj	phixnay	it's all in there... the system choice will be to shut off the computer, but you can use whatever you want
2007-02-25T09:42:00.000Z	phixnay	lakcaj	I already read that, I just don't understand the difference between halt and power off
2007-02-25T09:43:00.000Z	lakcaj	phixnay	I believe you can make the system shutdown, but not actually power down
2007-02-25T09:43:00.000Z	phixnay	lakcaj	so the system always chooses power off with -h?
2007-02-25T09:43:00.000Z	lakcaj	phixnay	yes, by default
2007-02-25T09:44:00.000Z	phixnay	lakcaj	so to turn off the computer at 10:46 am I would do "sudo shutdown -h 10:46"
2007-02-25T09:45:00.000Z	lakcaj	phixnay	I believe so, yes
2007-02-25T09:46:00.000Z	phixnay	lakcaj	I'm going to test a cron job that runs at 10:50 and shuts the computer down at 10:51
2007-02-25T09:47:00.000Z	lakcaj	phixnay	cool, if I see you quit this channel at 10:51 then it must have worked :)
2007-02-25T09:47:00.000Z	lakcaj	phixnay	I haven't played with cron in some time, sorry
2007-02-25T09:47:00.000Z	phixnay	lakcaj	ok
2007-02-25T09:51:00.000Z	phixnay	lakcaj	it's 10:51 and I'm not shut down
2007-02-25T09:51:00.000Z	phixnay	lakcaj	I tested cron and I know it's working
2007-02-25T09:52:00.000Z	lakcaj	phixnay	the command has to be run as root..... could that be the issue? (or sudo, whatever you use)
