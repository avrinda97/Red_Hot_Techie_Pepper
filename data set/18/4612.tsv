2010-10-15T02:48:00.000Z	_CommandeR_		Ok guys got an issue, when using +4096MB i get value out of range in fdisk
2010-10-15T02:50:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	_CommandeR_	verify using "p" in fdisk
2010-10-15T02:36:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	_CommandeR_	partitioning and mounting are two separate things
2010-10-15T02:37:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	_CommandeR_	/home should be type 82 or 83 (one is linux the other swap, forget which  is which)
2010-10-15T02:38:00.000Z	_CommandeR_	ZykoticK9	thanx, yes  it is 83 that is Linux
2010-10-15T02:49:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	_CommandeR_	you don't have that much space available most likely
2010-10-15T02:49:00.000Z	_CommandeR_	ZykoticK9	i should have 25gb
2010-10-15T02:51:00.000Z	_CommandeR_	ZykoticK9	blocks 83883366 for part1
2010-10-15T02:51:00.000Z	_CommandeR_	ZykoticK9	 for second 209158267+
2010-10-15T02:52:00.000Z	_CommandeR_	ZykoticK9	this is a raid array of 2 disk each 150gb so there is 300gb of space and should be 25gb of unpartitioned space
2010-10-15T02:52:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	_CommandeR_	ahh sorry - i can't help with RAID stuff.  good luck man.
2010-10-15T02:53:00.000Z	_CommandeR_	ZykoticK9	is there a command to se how mutch is left?
2010-10-15T02:54:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	_CommandeR_	when you use "n" for new with defaults what size does it create?  use "d" and the partition number to remove it (if you don't want it) - BE CAREFUL with this stuff!
2010-10-15T02:55:00.000Z	_CommandeR_	ZykoticK9	it defaults to 4480
2010-10-15T02:56:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	_CommandeR_	blocks?  i'm not sure if that would be 4GB?
2010-10-15T02:56:00.000Z	_CommandeR_	ZykoticK9	i guess it is blocks
2010-10-15T02:56:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	_CommandeR_	which brings me back to my first comment - not enough space most likely
2010-10-15T08:18:00.000Z	_CommandeR_	ZykoticK9	yeah but, windows would not boot even close
