2006-10-29T10:55:00.000Z	dbmonk74		i'm at a loss and I can't find anything on the forums
2006-10-29T10:57:00.000Z	dbmonk74		charlie: i haven't gotten to the actual install portion
2006-10-29T10:57:00.000Z	dbmonk74		i'm just booting from the livecd

2006-10-29T10:58:00.000Z	dbmonk74		i boot from live CD, then it says I can't use X - so i run the reconfig, and then I am not sure what to do next

2006-10-29T11:03:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	dbmonk74	startx ... not xstart
2006-10-29T11:03:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	dbmonk74	should i tell you about bash auto-complete too ?
2006-10-29T11:04:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	dbmonk74	bingo .. if you were doing it as you were typing xst you will see there is no such command as xstart
2006-10-29T11:05:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	dbmonk74	honestly , ubuntu isn't for geeks .. i would say other distros .. i would name no names :P
2006-10-29T11:10:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	dbmonk74	yes .. for your graphics card .. then install them
2006-10-29T11:17:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	dbmonk74	how do we tell you without you telling us your video card ?
2006-10-29T11:19:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	dbmonk74	whats the driver file name ?
2006-10-29T11:21:00.000Z	wickedpuppy	dbmonk74	search for it in synaptic or apt-cache ... there should be ubuntu driver without you compiling it.. and also pls do search on google
