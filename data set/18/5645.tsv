2010-10-20T15:49:00.000Z	jakewc2		ok, I have done the install, and things seem to be working, but I am having a few problems with updating, it says I have unmet dependancies, how do i get around that?
2010-10-20T15:50:00.000Z	coz_	jakewc2	  sudo apt-get install -f
2010-10-20T15:50:00.000Z	coz_	jakewc2	 are you trying to install something?
2010-10-20T15:54:00.000Z	coz_	jakewc2	 did you get that pastebined?
2010-10-20T15:55:00.000Z	coz_	jakewc2	 that is not a url that will open here
2010-10-20T15:56:00.000Z	coz_	jakewc2	  is this a fresh install?
2010-10-20T15:57:00.000Z	coz_	jakewc2	  and no other applications  were manually installed?
2010-10-20T15:57:00.000Z	coz_	jakewc2	 out of curiosity  try   sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
2010-10-20T16:02:00.000Z	coz_	jakewc2	 mm something is wrong./... my suggestion,, since this is a fresh install...if you have cd burning capability   ..go here   https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD   and download the minimal install cd  which is about 12 megs
2010-10-20T16:03:00.000Z	coz_	jakewc2	  when you run that... you will eventually get to a point that shows a list of what can be installed...scroll with arrow buttons and  choose with Space bar   ..DO NOT choose with Enter key
2010-10-20T16:04:00.000Z	coz_	jakewc2	 the advantage of this install is that is downloads  all current packages  so no updates are necessary  when you boot into the system...however this is NOT  alive  cd
2010-10-20T16:07:00.000Z	coz_	jakewc2	 ok sounds good :)
2010-10-20T16:08:00.000Z	coz_	jakewc2	 one tip when talking on irc.... type the first 3 letters of the name of the person you are talking to and hit the Tab key to complete their name...sometimes you have to Tab several times
2010-10-20T16:09:00.000Z	coz_	jakewc2	 there you go :)
2010-10-20T16:10:00.000Z	jakewc2	coz_	Asking to reboot, so will let you know after rebooting if that worked, one sec. Thank you so much, I really appreciate it.
2010-10-20T16:10:00.000Z	coz_	jakewc2	 cool
2010-10-20T16:13:00.000Z	jakewc2	coz_	yippee it worked, seems there was a dist uprade today, which isnt in the install yet.
