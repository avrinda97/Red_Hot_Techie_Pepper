2008-01-18T02:40:00.000Z	Flanger		Hi all... Can somebody tell me how I can change the default text editor (in bash)? It's set to Nano/Pico/Maxi/Medi to default, and I'm really longing for vi... pls help?
2008-01-18T02:41:00.000Z	Viking667	Flanger	you change the EDITOR environment variable
2008-01-18T02:42:00.000Z	Viking667	Flanger	and that is normally set in one of .bashrc or .bash_profile (assuming you're _using_ bash)
2008-01-18T02:44:00.000Z	Flanger	Viking667	Doesn't exist in .bashrc, or /etc/bash.bashrc. I'm running gutsy b.t.w. Do you know for certain it's not somewhere else?
2008-01-18T02:45:00.000Z	Viking667	Flanger	not entirely sure, but I _added_ mine.
2008-01-18T02:45:00.000Z	Viking667		i.e. export EDITOR=/your/place/to/vim-editor
2008-01-18T02:45:00.000Z	Flanger	Viking667	Ah... thanx, will do that too!
2008-01-18T02:46:00.000Z	Viking667	Flanger	in my case,    export EDITOR=/usr/bin/vim   <== though you could possibly leave off the /usr/bin/
2008-01-18T02:54:00.000Z	Flanger	Viking667	it's working, thanx a lot mate!
2008-01-18T02:55:00.000Z	Viking667	Flanger	you'll also find that PAGER is useful too, I set that to "less"
2008-01-18T02:55:00.000Z	Viking667		i.e. export PAGER=less
2008-01-18T02:56:00.000Z	Viking667	Flanger	those are both 0ld sk00l
2008-01-18T03:00:00.000Z	Flanger	Viking667	When does PAGER kick in?
2008-01-18T03:02:00.000Z	Viking667	Flanger	pager kicks in whenever you display a file via man
2008-01-18T03:02:00.000Z	Viking667	Flanger	for a LOT of unix or UNIX-lookalikes, the original PAGER was "more"
2008-01-18T03:03:00.000Z	Flanger	Viking667	cool! Well... we all know Less is more ;)
2008-01-18T03:03:00.000Z	Viking667		heh. And I can't even START xfwm4 on my remote X session. Or, at least one machine it'll work, the other it won't.
2008-01-18T03:03:00.000Z	Viking667	Flanger	lol. True
