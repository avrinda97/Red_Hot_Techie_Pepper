2008-12-16T11:02:00.000Z	Cainus		anyone know how to install the console-data or kbd packages? I get 404's everywhere
2008-12-16T11:03:00.000Z	Gnea	Cainus	do a  sudo apt-get update  and try again
2008-12-16T11:03:00.000Z	Cainus	Gnea	yeah... no dice
2008-12-16T11:03:00.000Z	Gnea	Cainus	are you sure you have the correct package names?
2008-12-16T11:03:00.000Z	Cainus	Gnea	yep... I find them in apt-cache search
2008-12-16T11:04:00.000Z	Gnea	Cainus	lsb_release -a  <-- what version does that result in?
2008-12-16T11:05:00.000Z	Cainus	Gnea	ubuntu 7.04 (feisty)
2008-12-16T11:06:00.000Z	Gnea	Cainus	oh my... I would highly recommend upgrading to gutsy and then hardy, if you can
2008-12-16T11:07:00.000Z	Gnea	Cainus	feisty does not have supported packages like that anymore
2008-12-16T11:08:00.000Z	Cainus	Gnea	shouldn't apt-get upgrade-dist do that?
2008-12-16T11:09:00.000Z	Gnea	Cainus	are you catching any 404's with that?
2008-12-16T11:10:00.000Z	Cainus	Gnea	no... but dist-upgrade doesn't really do anything either... it says 0 packages were installed
2008-12-16T11:11:00.000Z	Gnea	Cainus	then the system is fully up to date. if you want newer packages, you need to upgrade the entire distribution.
2008-12-16T11:13:00.000Z	Cainus	Gnea	thanks... I'm working on it ;)
2008-12-16T11:20:00.000Z	Cainus	Gnea	I'm getting 404's from do-release-upgrade ...
2008-12-16T11:20:00.000Z	Gnea	Cainus	o.O
2008-12-16T11:21:00.000Z	Gnea	Cainus	looks like you've fallen behind.... got a cd burner?
2008-12-16T11:21:00.000Z	Gnea	Cainus	yeah, it was a fiesty fawn, but bambi got hungry...
