2009-06-11T10:33:00.000Z	nahy		hi guys. my firefox can not show videos on youtube for example
2009-06-11T10:34:00.000Z	kandinski	nahy	go to orisinal.com and tell me what you see
2009-06-11T10:34:00.000Z	nahy		i reinstalled it
2009-06-11T10:34:00.000Z	kandinski	nahy	do you see the little flash games there?
2009-06-11T10:35:00.000Z	nahy		i see some pictures
2009-06-11T10:35:00.000Z	nahy		i see them
2009-06-11T10:35:00.000Z	kandinski		can you play the games?
2009-06-11T10:36:00.000Z	kandinski		if you do, you have flash, and your youtube videos problem is most likely due to other issues
2009-06-11T10:37:00.000Z	nahy		yes i can play
2009-06-11T10:37:00.000Z	nahy		i any page with flash movies i have the same problem
2009-06-11T10:39:00.000Z	kandinski	nahy	if you press the right/button on a game, what version of flash does it report for you?
2009-06-11T10:40:00.000Z	nahy		flash player 10
2009-06-11T10:41:00.000Z	kandinski	nahy	I think you have connection problems, not ubuntu/firefox/flash problems
2009-06-11T10:42:00.000Z	nahy		but in windows with the same sort of connection and speed i can see them
2009-06-11T10:42:00.000Z	kandinski	nahy	good point, but it's beyond me maybe someone else can help you
2009-06-11T10:42:00.000Z	nahy		thx anyway dear friend
2009-06-11T10:44:00.000Z	nahy	kandinski	should i repeat my question about the problem for the chan again?
2009-06-11T10:44:00.000Z	kandinski	nahy	maybe wait a bit so the people are new
