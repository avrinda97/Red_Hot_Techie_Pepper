2008-09-09T10:50:00.000Z	billybigrigger		how do i apply a chown and chmod on all files/folders and subfolders basically every file in my /var/www/
2008-09-09T10:50:00.000Z	billybigrigger		????
2008-09-09T10:50:00.000Z	`Matir	billybigrigger	supply -R to each chown and chmod
2008-09-09T10:50:00.000Z	billybigrigger	`Matir	tried that
2008-09-09T10:50:00.000Z	`Matir	billybigrigger	e.g, chown -R user:group /var/www
2008-09-09T10:51:00.000Z	billybigrigger	`Matir	it only works on /var/www/foo, not /var/www/foo/foo
2008-09-09T10:51:00.000Z	`Matir	billybigrigger	weird, it should work on all if you have the necessary permissions
2008-09-09T10:51:00.000Z	billybigrigger		shopt -s dotglob;  sudo chown root:root /var/www/*; sudo chmod +r /var/www/*
2008-09-09T10:51:00.000Z	billybigrigger		bahh
2008-09-09T10:52:00.000Z	`Matir	billybigrigger	that's lacking the -R option.... no need for the * either
2008-09-09T10:53:00.000Z	billybigrigger	`Matir	old command, sudo chmod +R o+rw /var/www with that command i can cd in /var/www/include/client says permission denied as its owned by root:root
2008-09-09T10:54:00.000Z	billybigrigger	`Matir	 i mean i can't cd in /var/www/include/client
2008-09-09T10:54:00.000Z	`Matir	billybigrigger	that has +R, not -R
2008-09-09T10:54:00.000Z	billybigrigger	`Matir	and yes i meant -r
2008-09-09T10:54:00.000Z	billybigrigger		well -R
2008-09-09T10:54:00.000Z	billybigrigger		i typed it didnt copy
2008-09-09T10:54:00.000Z	`Matir	billybigrigger	ah, then, I'm not sure, sorry... just checking the obvious.... hrrm, one second
2008-09-09T10:55:00.000Z	billybigrigger	`Matir	should files in my webroot be owned by me or root? im having all these wierd php errors i dont have permissions setup and its buggin the heck out of me
