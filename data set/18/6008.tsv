2008-08-06T23:30:00.000Z	xfm		Hi! I would like to launch emerald window decorator with a command but emerald --replace does not works
2008-08-06T23:30:00.000Z	xfm		work
2008-08-06T23:30:00.000Z	ikonia	xfm	what happens ?
2008-08-06T23:31:00.000Z	xfm	ikonia	I got this: [1] 9335
2008-08-06T23:31:00.000Z	ikonia	xfm	anything else ?
2008-08-06T23:32:00.000Z	ikonia	xfm	thats just the process id for emeral - it means it's running
2008-08-06T23:32:00.000Z	xfm		nop i have two themes installed, perhaps I have to indicate which one to choose?
2008-08-06T23:32:00.000Z	ikonia	xfm	yes, you then need to launch emerald theme manager
2008-08-06T23:32:00.000Z	xfm	ikonia	i would like to do it with  command lines, its for a script
2008-08-06T23:33:00.000Z	ikonia	xfm	like to do what ?
2008-08-06T23:33:00.000Z	xfm	ikonia	like everybody switch automatically compiz/metacity while lauching vlc for example
2008-08-06T23:34:00.000Z	xfm	ikonia	I can do it but while relanching compiz, the emerald theme does not come back
2008-08-06T23:34:00.000Z	ikonia	xfm	well 1.) running desktop effects over a remote desktop is not a good idea 2.) you just need to modify the files and dir's in people /home .emerald directory
2008-08-06T23:35:00.000Z	xfm	ikonia	i don't understand what is a remote desktop? Is it emerald? It works pretty well
2008-08-06T23:35:00.000Z	ikonia	xfm	vnc is a remove desktop
2008-08-06T23:36:00.000Z	ikonia	xfm	ahh you said vlc , not vnc, sorry
2008-08-06T23:36:00.000Z	xfm	ikonia	ok, I juste want to do this on my own desktop
2008-08-06T23:36:00.000Z	ikonia	xfm	why do you not just setup emerald to be your default window manager instead of stopping/starting it
