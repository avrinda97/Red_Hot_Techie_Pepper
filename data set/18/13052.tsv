2006-09-10T07:13:00.000Z	vasi	eugman	.jigdo is a text format, you can just use any text editor
2006-09-10T07:13:00.000Z	vasi	eugman	if you want to download using a .jigdo file, you should 'apt-get install jigdo'
2006-09-10T07:13:00.000Z	eugman	vasi	Ubuntu is telling me it's a bin file. And it also thinks it's an unreadable archive.
2006-09-10T07:14:00.000Z	vasi	eugman	what does 'file foo.jigdo' give you?
2006-09-10T07:15:00.000Z	eugman	vasi	Desktop/woody-i386-1.jigdo: gzip compressed data, from Unix, max compression
2006-09-10T07:15:00.000Z	vasi	eugman	so it's compressed, try decompressing it :-)    gzip -cd foo.jigdo > foo-unicompressed.jigdo
2006-09-10T07:17:00.000Z	vasi	eugman	great!
2006-09-10T07:17:00.000Z	vasi	eugman	for the future, 'file' will almost always help you figure out what format a file is in
2006-09-10T07:17:00.000Z	vasi	eugman	well it's not an archive (like a .tar.gz)
2006-09-10T07:18:00.000Z	eugman	vasi	rather confusing but ok.
2006-09-10T07:18:00.000Z	vasi	eugman	well compressing and archiving are two different things
2006-09-10T07:18:00.000Z	vasi	eugman	yes it should, but somebody named it wrong!
2006-09-10T07:26:00.000Z	vasi	eugman	i believe 'elinks' and 'links' tend to be better than 'lynx;
2006-09-10T07:26:00.000Z	eugman	vasi	unless you want to read that page. hehe.
2006-09-10T07:50:00.000Z	vasi	eugman	dash is smaller, has less features
2006-09-10T07:50:00.000Z	vasi	eugman	lol
