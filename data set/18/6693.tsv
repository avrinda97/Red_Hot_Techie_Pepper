2008-07-11T03:14:00.000Z	Swish		at least you guys are in agreement that defrag tools don't really exist
2008-07-11T03:14:00.000Z	Swish		haha
2008-07-11T03:14:00.000Z	mneptok	Swish	defrag tools on Linux are like male nipples.
2008-07-11T03:15:00.000Z	Swish	mneptok	I resent that.  I have very nice male nipples.
2008-07-11T03:15:00.000Z	mneptok	Swish	you don't need to defrag
2008-07-11T03:15:00.000Z	mneptok	Swish	welcome to real filesystems
2008-07-11T03:15:00.000Z	Swish	mneptok	you must be trying to make a joke ;)
2008-07-11T03:16:00.000Z	mneptok	Swish	no.
2008-07-11T03:16:00.000Z	mneptok	Swish	why do you need to defrag?
2008-07-11T03:17:00.000Z	Swish	mneptok	same group of ... 75GB or so files.  On the "fragmented" server, an md5sum of those files takes about three times longer than on another server (if I just copy the files to the other server; identical hardware)
2008-07-11T03:17:00.000Z	mneptok	Swish	have you fsck'ed the partition in question recently?
2008-07-11T03:18:00.000Z	Swish	mneptok	I did a touch /forcefsck and rebooted the server, yes
2008-07-11T03:18:00.000Z	mneptok	Swish	try a "sudo fsck -yf /dev/whatever" with the device unmounted
2008-07-11T03:18:00.000Z	Swish	mneptok	it's my root fs bud :)
2008-07-11T03:18:00.000Z	mneptok	Swish	try a "sudo fsck.ext3 -yf /dev/whatever" with the device unmounted
2008-07-11T03:19:00.000Z	mneptok	Swish	so boot from optical media
2008-07-11T03:19:00.000Z	Swish	mneptok	as I said earlier, it's a headless remote server
2008-07-11T03:19:00.000Z	mneptok	Swish	so then use the serial console.
