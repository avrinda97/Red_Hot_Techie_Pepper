2011-01-19T07:59:00.000Z	KM0201	jPuff	do you know which one?.. belkin makes a lot of N wireless devices... /sighs.
2011-01-19T08:02:00.000Z	jPuff	KM0201	FSD8053
2011-01-19T08:02:00.000Z	KM0201	jPuff	that should work out of the box... at least mine does
2011-01-19T08:02:00.000Z	KM0201	jPuff	what version of ubuntu are you using
2011-01-19T08:03:00.000Z	KM0201	jPuff	have you tried unplugging it, and then plugging it back in?
2011-01-19T08:04:00.000Z	jPuff	KM0201	no
2011-01-19T08:06:00.000Z	KM0201	jPuff	idon't understand what you mean you're right next to the router?.. thats irrelevant at this point, are you seeing networks.
2011-01-19T08:07:00.000Z	KM0201	jPuff	...  have you tried disconnecting the cable, and then connecting to wireless?
2011-01-19T08:07:00.000Z	KM0201	jPuff	most of the time, ubuntu defaults to the wired connection
2011-01-19T08:07:00.000Z	jPuff	KM0201	im connected by both the belkin and the cable
2011-01-19T08:08:00.000Z	KM0201	jPuff	thats quite an amazing feat,are you wanting to be connected by both, or just one
2011-01-19T08:08:00.000Z	KM0201	jPuff	then disconnect the wired connect, and try to connect to your wireless
2011-01-19T08:09:00.000Z	KM0201	jPuff	i dunno, i use mine all over the house, no problems
2011-01-19T08:09:00.000Z	KM0201	jPuff	ok, then i would wait
2011-01-19T09:24:00.000Z	jPuff	KM0201	my internet just disconnected :(
2011-01-19T09:36:00.000Z	jPuff	KM0201	im still having disconnection issues
