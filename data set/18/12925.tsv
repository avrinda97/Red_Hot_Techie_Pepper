2006-02-28T07:54:00.000Z	Fujitsu	roostishaw	that is the problem.
2006-06-04T05:26:00.000Z	Fujitsu	roostishaw	waiting 8 seconds isn't long enough between asks.
2006-06-04T05:26:00.000Z	Fujitsu	roostishaw	wget http://whatever/whatever
2006-06-04T05:26:00.000Z	roostishaw	Fujitsu	\\
2006-06-04T05:26:00.000Z	Fujitsu	roostishaw	why backslash!?
2006-06-04T05:27:00.000Z	roostishaw	Fujitsu	is wget anonymous... b that I mean will there be any way for them to detect me?
2006-06-04T05:27:00.000Z	Fujitsu	roostishaw	they can always detect you!
2006-06-04T05:27:00.000Z	Fujitsu	roostishaw	there is no way of stopping them.
2006-06-04T05:28:00.000Z	roostishaw	Fujitsu	no, I mean is there a way to do it so they dont know who is doing the downloading?
2006-06-04T05:28:00.000Z	Fujitsu	roostishaw	they only know approximately which ISP it is.
2006-06-04T05:29:00.000Z	roostishaw	Fujitsu	so they have no real way to block me (specifically me) from downloading a file
2006-06-04T05:30:00.000Z	Fujitsu	roostishaw	no.
2006-06-04T05:30:00.000Z	Fujitsu	roostishaw	not easily, anyway.
