2006-08-27T16:06:00.000Z	longwave	Pulshion	there is a tool called "rovclock" that overclocks radeon cards
2006-08-27T16:06:00.000Z	Pulshion	longwave	-- i am using it, but i need some tool to make my fan spin harder for the video card and also check temp of the gpu
2006-08-27T16:08:00.000Z	longwave	Pulshion	hrm, i've never seen anything that does that on linux, but it may exist..
2006-08-27T16:08:00.000Z	Pulshion	longwave	-- hmm
2006-08-27T16:08:00.000Z	Pulshion	longwave	-- even the app that gives the temp for video card?
2006-08-27T16:09:00.000Z	longwave	Pulshion	lm_sensors generally does things like that but i don't know if it will do GPU temperature
2006-08-27T16:10:00.000Z	Pulshion	longwave	-- do i apt-get lm_sensors?
2006-08-27T16:10:00.000Z	longwave	Pulshion	the package name is lm-sensors i think
2006-08-27T16:10:00.000Z	longwave	Pulshion	sensors-applet will let you add temperatures to a gnome panel, too
2006-08-27T16:11:00.000Z	Pulshion	longwave	-- installing right now
2006-08-27T16:14:00.000Z	Pulshion	longwave	-- i installed it but how do i run it now?
2006-08-27T16:14:00.000Z	longwave	Pulshion	sensors-applet or lm-sensors?
2006-08-27T16:15:00.000Z	Pulshion	longwave	-- hmm, neither...i forgot to look sigh
2006-08-28T09:04:00.000Z	longwave	Pulshion	if you do not need a GPG key for encryption, you can probably delete it
