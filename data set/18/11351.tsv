2006-08-09T13:45:00.000Z	Spydon		How do i install a soundcard?? I have no sound, because the live cd didnt install my soundcard :'(
2006-08-09T13:45:00.000Z	phenex	Spydon	are you sure it wasn't installed? look at 'dmesg' and 'lspci'
2006-08-09T13:46:00.000Z	phenex	Spydon	i mean to make sure it was detected
2006-08-09T13:48:00.000Z	Spydon	phenex	i can here "system error sounds" or what they are called, the beeps but no other sound
2006-08-09T13:49:00.000Z	phenex	Spydon	yeah that's the beeps through your computer speaker i'd say, not through soundcard
2006-08-09T13:49:00.000Z	phenex	Spydon	do the 'lspci' command in a terminal
2006-08-09T13:51:00.000Z	phenex	Spydon	actually do 'lspci | grep audio' and tell me if anything comes up
2006-08-09T13:52:00.000Z	phenex	Spydon	it was working with another OS, ie Windows?
2006-08-09T13:52:00.000Z	phenex	Spydon	what is your soundcard?
2006-08-09T13:53:00.000Z	phenex	Spydon	ah right i see
2006-08-09T13:54:00.000Z	phenex	Spydon	if i knew more about it, i could find out if there is a module available or something
2006-08-09T13:55:00.000Z	phenex	Spydon	find out in windows
2006-08-09T13:55:00.000Z	phenex	Spydon	device manager or something
2006-08-09T13:55:00.000Z	phenex	Spydon	heh
2006-08-09T13:55:00.000Z	phenex	Spydon	hmm i really don't know then
2006-08-09T13:56:00.000Z	phenex	Spydon	you have to find out about the sound card
2006-08-09T13:56:00.000Z	phenex	Spydon	then i'm sure it can be made to work
2006-08-09T13:56:00.000Z	phenex	Spydon	good question
