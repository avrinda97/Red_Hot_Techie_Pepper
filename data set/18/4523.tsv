2009-03-27T22:16:00.000Z	noobguest		Why am I unable to find testdisk in the synaptic package manager?
2009-03-27T22:16:00.000Z	LjL	noobguest	what does "apt-cache policy testdisk | grep Candidate" say?
2009-03-27T22:17:00.000Z	LjL	noobguest	you type that in a terminal
2009-03-27T22:17:00.000Z	noobguest	LjL	thanks
2009-03-27T22:18:00.000Z	noobguest	LjL	it says "W: Unable to locate package testdisk"
2009-03-27T22:18:00.000Z	LjL	noobguest	ok, pastebin the contents of your /etc/apt/sources.list file
2009-03-27T22:23:00.000Z	noobguest	LjL	how do I perform an interrogatory of sources.list?
2009-03-27T22:23:00.000Z	LjL	noobguest	gksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
2009-03-27T22:27:00.000Z	noobguest	LjL	very grateful
2009-03-27T22:31:00.000Z	noobguest	LjL	did I miss that source.list line addition?
2009-03-27T22:31:00.000Z	LjL	noobguest	i didn't add anything, i just uncommented some lines
2009-03-27T22:31:00.000Z	LjL	noobguest	http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/139132/
2009-03-27T22:32:00.000Z	noobguest	LjL	again very grateful.
2009-03-27T22:33:00.000Z	noobguest	LjL	this has been very educational.
2009-03-27T22:33:00.000Z	LjL	noobguest	when you've saved your new sources.list, type "sudo apt-get update", then you should be able to install testdisk
2009-03-27T22:34:00.000Z	noobguest	LjL	ah k. would a reboot do the same thing?
2009-03-27T22:34:00.000Z	LjL	noobguest	no
2009-03-27T22:34:00.000Z	noobguest	LjL	if i wasnt using the live-on
