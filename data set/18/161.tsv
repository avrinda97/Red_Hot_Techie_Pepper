2012-08-20T13:35:00.000Z	GeorgeJ		Hello folks!
2012-08-20T13:36:00.000Z	GeorgeJ		I'm having a very strange, reocurring issue(I don't know how to reproduce it though, it seems to start randomly).  When I right click within a window, the context menu loses focus over the window, everytime.
2012-08-20T13:37:00.000Z	GeorgeJ		It would appear as if the context menu doesn't even appear, however if i click somewheren ear the right edge of a window, the context menu is shown, but the window is above it.
2012-08-20T13:37:00.000Z	GeorgeJ		This happens with all windows. Is this a know issue? How can this be fixed?
2012-08-20T13:38:00.000Z	W4sp	GeorgeJ	What desktop environment do you have?
2012-08-20T13:41:00.000Z	W4sp	GeorgeJ	Admittingly I haven't heard about it. That doesn't mean anything though. :-) If you have the scroll bar minimized (scroll bar doesn't show until you are with your pointer at the right hand side of your window) ...
2012-08-20T13:42:00.000Z	GeorgeJ	W4sp	It happens with all windows, and even with the top-bar menus drop-down menus.
2012-08-20T13:46:00.000Z	W4sp	GeorgeJ	That's odd. I am on thin ice. ;-)
2012-08-20T13:51:00.000Z	W4sp	GeorgeJ	Thanks. It slowly dawns in me. Can you check if you have auto-raise activated?
2012-08-20T13:51:00.000Z	GeorgeJ	W4sp	Sure, just a second.
2012-08-20T13:55:00.000Z	GeorgeJ	W4sp	If you don't mind me asking. Where is auto-raise? I can't seem to find it in CCSM
2012-08-20T13:56:00.000Z	W4sp	GeorgeJ	OK, i will figure it out for you. Regrettably I don't use unity nor GNOME. But I will somewhat find it out as I have all this installed.
2012-08-20T13:58:00.000Z	GeorgeJ	W4sp	Well, the issue rarely occurs. I'll keep search for autoraise. There seems to be no mention of this when searching the web.
2012-08-20T13:58:00.000Z	W4sp	GeorgeJ	Do you have ccsm? Terminal and 'ccsm &' should give you that. But ccsm isn't really supported.
2012-08-20T13:59:00.000Z	GeorgeJ	W4sp	I do have ccsm.
2012-08-20T14:00:00.000Z	GeorgeJ	W4sp	I've found auto-raise. It is not enabled.
2012-08-20T14:03:00.000Z	W4sp	GeorgeJ	Yes, better not use ccsm. I understand that not everything that ccsm is capable of is supported by GNOME3/Unity.
2012-08-20T14:07:00.000Z	GeorgeJ	W4sp	ThinkT510: Thanks!
