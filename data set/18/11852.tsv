2006-07-19T05:45:00.000Z	Paladine	bintut	where did you aquire a Wincor printer from?
2006-07-19T05:49:00.000Z	bintut	Paladine	from a local reseller.
2006-07-19T05:50:00.000Z	Paladine	bintut	I doubt you will be able to find a generic driver you will have to contact wincor themselves
2006-07-19T05:51:00.000Z	Paladine	bintut	I have a lot of experience with Wincor and they do things in some very strange ways
