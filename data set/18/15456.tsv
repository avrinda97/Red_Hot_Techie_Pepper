2005-09-22T16:06:00.000Z	cafuego_	war-totem	it wouldn't normally.
2005-09-22T16:06:00.000Z	cafuego_	war-totem	dpkg -l | grep xserver
2005-09-22T16:06:00.000Z	cafuego_	war-totem	what does that say?
2005-09-22T16:06:00.000Z	cafuego_	war-totem	(you cna ctrl-c the download)
2005-09-22T16:08:00.000Z	cafuego_	war-totem	Okay, I suspect you used to have xserver-xfree86, not xserver-xorg
2005-09-22T16:08:00.000Z	cafuego_	war-totem	Nah, go with xorg, works fine
2005-09-22T16:08:00.000Z	cafuego_	war-totem	Yes, they should be.
2005-09-22T16:09:00.000Z	cafuego_	war-totem	rebooting?
2005-09-22T16:12:00.000Z	cafuego_	war-totem	Not without knowing what caused it
