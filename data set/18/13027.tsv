2006-01-24T10:12:00.000Z	seroxat		could anyone do me a favor? i need a direct link to a burning program that handles cue/bin files
2006-01-24T10:13:00.000Z	seroxat		or if theres anyway to format MBR inside linux
2006-01-24T10:13:00.000Z	seroxat		is there a way to format the MBR from Linux?
2006-01-24T10:14:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	seroxat	What do you want to put on it, or do you just want to clear it (for god knows what reason)?
2006-01-24T10:14:00.000Z	seroxat	tonyyarusso	clear it
2006-01-24T10:16:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	seroxat	Couldn't you just fix grub from your live session?
2006-01-24T10:16:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	seroxat	Because Windows is dumb and doesn't have a better way to reinstall it's native mbr stuff.
2006-01-24T10:16:00.000Z	seroxat	tonyyarusso	 IF i had the disc i could have ran fixmbr from the rescue console
2006-01-24T10:17:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	seroxat	But nobody ships disks anymore.
2006-01-24T10:18:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	seroxat	What setuid said will clear everything in the mbr to zeros.  Meaning you will have no mbr after that.
2006-01-24T10:19:00.000Z	seroxat	tonyyarusso	ok but knoppix does have fdisk
2006-01-24T10:20:00.000Z	seroxat	tonyyarusso	how is it useless if it makes me able to boot up my OS?
2006-01-24T10:20:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	seroxat	That's the thing.  It won't.
2006-01-24T10:21:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	seroxat	It will make your computer at boot go, "Hey, so what should I do to boot something?", and the mbr will say, "Uh, nothing.  Go back to bed."
2006-01-24T10:21:00.000Z	seroxat	tonyyarusso	thats weird because it worked fine from windows boot floppys
2006-01-24T10:22:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	seroxat	Clearing everything?  I don't think so.  fixmbr may work (although I'll let others talk about it's safety).  But there's no way a dd is going to.
2006-01-24T10:22:00.000Z	seroxat	tonyyarusso	fixmbr works perfectly
2006-01-24T10:24:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	seroxat	You could do sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop, which will stop gdm and take X down with it.
