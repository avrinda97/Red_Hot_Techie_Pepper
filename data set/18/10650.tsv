2007-12-13T13:31:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ZIDTY	Fedora 5 is pretty old, sure you don't mean RHEL Centos or Fedora 7/8?
2007-12-13T13:31:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ZIDTY	What error?
2007-12-13T13:36:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ZIDTY	AFIK none exist yet, it's a feature for OEMs like Dell
2007-12-13T13:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ZIDTY	You said Ubuntu and Fedora 8 were giving the same error, what error is that?
2007-12-13T13:39:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ZIDTY	If it boots once at all it's not likely your fault
2007-12-13T13:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ZIDTY	yikes :)
2007-12-13T13:41:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ZIDTY	Yet the LiveCD runs fine?
2007-12-13T13:42:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ZIDTY	I would file a bug report
