2007-10-22T16:36:00.000Z	silici0		i'm using Ubuntu 7.04 - the Feisty Fawn
2007-10-22T16:36:00.000Z	silici0		and it has a new version 7.10
2007-10-22T16:37:00.000Z	silici0		is it safe to update ?
2007-10-22T16:37:00.000Z	MenZa	silici0	Generally, yes.
2007-10-22T16:37:00.000Z	MenZa	silici0	Unless you've used Automatix or similar tools.
2007-10-22T16:37:00.000Z	silici0	MenZa	i don't know that tool
2007-10-22T16:37:00.000Z	MenZa	silici0	Because in said case, I wouldn't do so.
2007-10-22T16:37:00.000Z	silici0	MenZa	what kindy it is ?
2007-10-22T16:38:00.000Z	MenZa	silici0	Kindy?
2007-10-22T16:38:00.000Z	silici0	MenZa	 yeah, how i see if i use it ?
2007-10-22T16:38:00.000Z	MenZa	silici0	Have you installed Automatix?
2007-10-22T16:38:00.000Z	silici0	MenZa	 i don't think so
2007-10-22T16:38:00.000Z	MenZa	silici0	Then it /should/ be safe to update.
2007-10-22T16:38:00.000Z	MenZa	silici0	Good luck updating :)
2007-10-22T16:39:00.000Z	silici0	MenZa	 i worry about that because i'm using at work
2007-10-22T16:39:00.000Z	MenZa	silici0	Well, if any problems occur, come back in here. The update process has become much more smooth over the past few years.
2007-10-22T16:40:00.000Z	silici0	MenZa	 i'll try
2007-10-22T16:40:00.000Z	silici0	MenZa	thanks, man
