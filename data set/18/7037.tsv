2011-03-24T07:27:00.000Z	Docfxit	ac7ss	How can I clean out apt cache?
2011-03-24T07:28:00.000Z	ac7ss	Docfxit	sudo apt-get clean
2011-03-24T07:29:00.000Z	ac7ss	Docfxit	this may be enough to give you some wiggle room. that and purging old log files.
2011-03-24T07:30:00.000Z	Docfxit	ac7ss	Thank you. It didn't give me any room.
2011-03-24T07:32:00.000Z	Docfxit	ac7ss	You can see the entire disk here: http://cid-5b24c4477fa4734d.photos.live.com/self.aspx/Ubuntu/UbuntuDiskUsage2011-03-23.jpg
2011-03-24T07:33:00.000Z	ac7ss	Docfxit	what is the big file in red on lower right?
2011-03-24T07:34:00.000Z	ac7ss	Docfxit	you need to migrate some of those files in /media that is too small of a drive. (I have thumb drives larger than that.)
2011-03-24T07:34:00.000Z	Docfxit	ac7ss	I will run it again to see if it will tell me.
2011-03-24T07:37:00.000Z	Docfxit	ac7ss	Media is not being used. It's a dual boot. That partition is Windows XP
2011-03-24T07:40:00.000Z	ac7ss	Docfxit	according to what you posted, /media is the biggest user.
2011-03-24T07:40:00.000Z	ac7ss	Docfxit	what does df report? (post to pastbin.)
2011-03-24T07:43:00.000Z	Docfxit	ac7ss	Here is df report http://pastebin.com/2qSUUFwB
2011-03-24T07:46:00.000Z	ac7ss	Docfxit	looks like the biggest thing is in /var
2011-03-24T07:47:00.000Z	ac7ss	Docfxit	try 'du /var/ |sort -nr|head ' and report the biggest file.
2011-03-24T07:50:00.000Z	Docfxit	ac7ss	I just deleted a 600M file. This link shows what is in var now. http://pastebin.com/Nb5PN0wW
2011-03-24T07:52:00.000Z	ac7ss	Docfxit	looks like the /var/spool/asterisk/monitor directory is what is filling it. check its contents (delete old wav files) and check your asterisk config.
2011-03-24T08:16:00.000Z	ac7ss	Docfxit	how is it going?
