2009-09-24T06:28:00.000Z	dobblego		I tried to install dual-boot on a dell machine with vista and the partitioner ran into an error as soon as it tried to do its thing -- I looked around in BIOS for perhaps some setting protecting the MBR but I could find nothing, any tips on what it could be?
2009-09-24T06:29:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dobblego	ok did you let Ubuntu resize your  Vista partition?
2009-09-24T06:29:00.000Z	dobblego	sebsebseb	I tried, but it hit an error immediately trying to do so
2009-09-24T06:29:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dobblego	ok
2009-09-24T06:30:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dobblego	you shoudn't  use Gparted or any of that to resize  a Vista partition, because data loss migh thappen
2009-09-24T06:30:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dobblego	instead let Vista resize itself,  there's a built in tool or two for this, well two sure,  the graphical one and the command line
2009-09-24T06:30:00.000Z	dobblego	sebsebseb	does the ubuntu installation use gparted?
2009-09-24T06:30:00.000Z	dobblego	sebsebseb	ok, so I boot into vista to use this tool?
2009-09-24T06:30:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dobblego	the Ubuntu installer uses something else
2009-09-24T06:31:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dobblego	yes let Vista resize itself, and no you don't use Gparted in Vista
2009-09-24T06:31:00.000Z	sebsebseb		!gparted |  dobblego
2009-09-24T06:31:00.000Z	dobblego	sebsebseb	ok, I'll have to figure out what you use then
2009-09-24T06:31:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dobblego	What I am saying is don't let the  Ubuntu installer or Gparted resize your Vista partition.
2009-09-24T06:31:00.000Z	dobblego		yes I have used gparted before, I wasn't using gparted
2009-09-24T06:31:00.000Z	dobblego	sebsebseb	ok, a windows thing to do it then, thanks
2009-09-24T06:32:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dobblego	thinking of what I mean uhmm.  system  computer right click, and computer management or something.   well ##windows can help you resize Vista anyway,  plus you might find that, even after you resized it using it's tool, it's taking up tons of space
2009-09-24T06:33:00.000Z	dobblego	sebsebseb	ok, I'll look into it thanks, I don't suppose there is a ubuntu wiki page on it
2009-09-24T06:33:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dobblego	nope don't think so
