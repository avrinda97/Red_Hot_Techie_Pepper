2010-11-20T04:05:00.000Z	snake__		is there a diagnostic for seeing why my lamp server is not working?
2010-11-20T04:05:00.000Z	jrib	snake__	define "not worknig"
2010-11-20T04:06:00.000Z	snake__	jrib	so i can view the contents of my server on my local network, but it cannot be found anywhere outside of my lan.
2010-11-20T04:06:00.000Z	jrib	snake__	that's likely a router issue
2010-11-20T04:07:00.000Z	snake__	jrib	i have nat set up, plus my firewall is off on my router.
2010-11-20T04:08:00.000Z	jrib	snake__	port 80 needs to be forwarded
2010-11-20T04:09:00.000Z	snake__	jrib	is this possible on netgear?
2010-11-20T04:09:00.000Z	jrib	snake__	probably, you have to check its documentation
2010-11-20T04:09:00.000Z	snake__	jrib	cool. thanks.
2010-11-20T04:28:00.000Z	snake__	jrib	ok, if my settings are correct; I should be able to give my friend my external ip, and it will forward to my servers internal ip. correct?
2010-11-20T04:30:00.000Z	snake__	jrib	should i change my server port to 80? or keep it a 3306?
2010-11-20T04:31:00.000Z	jrib	snake__	whatever you want
2010-11-20T04:31:00.000Z	snake__	jrib	but how does my router know where to go?
2010-11-20T04:32:00.000Z	jrib	snake__	you tell it :)
2010-11-20T04:32:00.000Z	snake__	jrib	but it does not ask me...
2010-11-20T04:32:00.000Z	jrib	snake__	you need to consult your router's documentation, I don't know about it
2010-11-20T04:34:00.000Z	snake__	jrib	it says it must be 80
2011-01-20T04:12:00.000Z	jrib	snake__	try gambas
