2008-05-22T20:15:00.000Z	dissent		guys how could I turn off the computer at specify time ?
2008-05-22T20:16:00.000Z	greenmoss	dissent	use "at" if it's one-time, or "cron" if it's periodic
2008-05-22T20:16:00.000Z	greenmoss	dissent	maybe there's some gui tools too, but I don't know that side of it
2008-05-22T20:17:00.000Z	dissent	greenmoss	i dont need gui tool ... but I just need the specify command :D
2008-05-22T20:18:00.000Z	greenmoss	dissent	`at 10:00`, then you will get a new line, then type "halt" (or "reboot"), then hit ctrl-d
2008-05-22T20:18:00.000Z	dissent	greenmoss	ok I'll try
2008-05-22T20:19:00.000Z	greenmoss		rrdtool? anyone? it complains of "undefined symbol: art_alloc"
2008-05-22T20:20:00.000Z	greenmoss		if I try to build rrdtool using debuild from the official source package I get "undefined reference to `art_alloc'"
2008-05-22T20:20:00.000Z	dissent	greenmoss	problem :) .. nothing happened
2008-05-22T20:21:00.000Z	greenmoss	dissent	it will do the reboot/halt at the time mentioned; you can verify by looking in /var/spool/cron/atspool
2008-05-22T20:22:00.000Z	greenmoss	dissent	you may also need to ensure the "at" package is installed
2008-05-22T20:23:00.000Z	dissent	greenmoss	I think its installed .. because there was : job 2 at Thu May 22 17:20:00 2008
2008-05-22T20:23:00.000Z	greenmoss	dissent	should be able to `cat` the file in there, and it will have whatever you typed in
2008-05-22T20:24:00.000Z	dissent	greenmoss	its nothing in that dir
2008-05-22T20:24:00.000Z	dissent	greenmoss	mean theres nothing
2008-05-22T20:25:00.000Z	greenmoss	dissent	oh, seems to be in /var/spool/cron/atjobs
2008-05-22T20:27:00.000Z	dissent		.
2008-05-22T20:28:00.000Z	dissent	greenmoss	there is in the end of file } halt
