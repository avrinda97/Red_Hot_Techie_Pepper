2005-12-25T09:41:00.000Z	blizzkid		How can I run a script at startup?
2005-12-25T09:42:00.000Z	soundray	blizzkid	add it to /etc/init.d/bootmisc.sh
2005-12-25T09:43:00.000Z	blizzkid	soundray	just at the end?
2005-12-25T09:43:00.000Z	soundray	blizzkid	before 'exit 0' :)
2007-03-02T12:42:00.000Z	blizzkid	soundray	you mean I should join channel ubuntu+1?
2007-03-02T12:42:00.000Z	soundray	blizzkid	yes
2007-10-30T03:29:00.000Z	soundray	blizzkid	I think your best chance is to ext3-format your partition and unpack the iso file contents to it.
2007-10-30T03:30:00.000Z	blizzkid	soundray	and you think there will be a way to boot from it then?
2007-10-30T03:31:00.000Z	soundray	blizzkid	yes. There are additional steps required -- I think I've seen a howto that showed the procedure for knoppix
2007-10-30T03:33:00.000Z	blizzkid	soundray	I gues I have to point grub to a certain file then?
2007-10-30T03:33:00.000Z	soundray	blizzkid	yes
2007-10-30T03:34:00.000Z	blizzkid	soundray	you happen to know which file that would be?
2007-10-30T03:35:00.000Z	soundray	blizzkid	in the case of knoppix, it's vmlinuz
2007-10-30T03:35:00.000Z	blizzkid	soundray	it's for ubuntustudio
2007-10-30T04:13:00.000Z	blizzkid	soundray	I tried this: http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-desktop-74/installing-without-cd-592527/ to boot form an iso, but grub comes back with error 22 "no such partition)
2007-10-30T04:16:00.000Z	soundray	blizzkid	have you considered that grub's partition naming starts counting at zero?
2007-10-30T04:17:00.000Z	blizzkid	soundray	are you sure? it says (hd0,1) for my winxp partition (which is the first one)
2007-10-30T04:18:00.000Z	blizzkid	soundray	sorry. I misread
