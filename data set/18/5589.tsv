2008-11-01T20:30:00.000Z	rmn		is there a way of knowing *what* makes a filesystem busy when i try to unmount?
2008-11-01T20:31:00.000Z	prince_jammys	rmn	fuser
2008-11-01T20:35:00.000Z	prince_jammys	rmn	is it your current terminal where you're running the command ?
2008-11-01T20:36:00.000Z	prince_jammys	rmn	hehe
2008-11-01T20:36:00.000Z	rmn	prince_jammys	no.  i checked all my open terminals, and can't find it
2008-11-01T20:38:00.000Z	rmn	prince_jammys	n8tuser , managed to kill it.  for whatever reason kill in bash doesn't seem as powerful as it used to be.  more and more frequently i have to go the gui to kill a process properly
2008-11-01T20:38:00.000Z	prince_jammys	rmn	it probably ended up sending a different signal
2008-11-01T20:39:00.000Z	prince_jammys	rmn	the gui probably attempts 'friendly' signals, and gradually more 'ugly' signals to kill it
2008-11-01T20:40:00.000Z	rmn	prince_jammys	so, eh... what's the ugliest way of killing?
2008-11-01T20:40:00.000Z	prince_jammys	rmn	-9
2008-11-01T20:40:00.000Z	prince_jammys	rmn	(usually NOT desirable)
2008-11-01T20:40:00.000Z	rmn	prince_jammys	kill -9 pid
2008-11-01T20:40:00.000Z	prince_jammys	rmn	yes, but should not be abused. rarely needed.
2008-11-01T20:41:00.000Z	rmn	prince_jammys	and would i be right in assuming that the kill can then be graduated by -3 -4 ... -9 ?
2008-11-01T20:41:00.000Z	prince_jammys	rmn	no. 'man kill' lists the signals, and their respective numbers
2008-11-01T20:42:00.000Z	rmn	prince_jammys	ok.  thank you.
2008-11-01T20:42:00.000Z	prince_jammys	rmn	though that 'kill' is not the actual one that bash uses. bash has its own builtin kill command
2008-11-01T20:42:00.000Z	prince_jammys	rmn	but the signal names are the same
