2008-08-25T12:33:00.000Z	Kohlrak-Server		is there any way possible to install the fglrx driver on hardy without reformatting and doing it on gutsy where things work?
2008-08-25T12:34:00.000Z	favro	Kohlrak-Server	I haven't found one...
2008-08-25T12:35:00.000Z	Kohlrak-Server	favro	if we're lucky, maybe the next release of ubuntu (october something according to wikipedia) will actually be stable
2008-08-25T12:36:00.000Z	favro	Kohlrak-Server	I have not been enjoying hardy at all
2008-08-25T12:37:00.000Z	Kohlrak-Server	favro	i was as i could view flash and java fine with a 64bit browser, but the driver issues have been getting worse and worse. It's too much work just to keep your system running now.
2008-08-25T12:38:00.000Z	favro	Kohlrak-Server	just before I went back to dapper I was thinking I was spending tooo much time trying to get hardy working
2008-08-25T12:39:00.000Z	Kohlrak-Server	favro	i might just build my own kernel after all this mess. It's rediculous. I've been having more hardware issues on ubuntu than software issues on windows... That's sayin' soemthing.
2008-08-25T12:40:00.000Z	favro	Kohlrak-Server	I believe it is the new x that is the issue
2008-08-25T12:41:00.000Z	Kohlrak-Server	favro	new X? Why would you want to update a system that works?
2008-08-25T12:42:00.000Z	favro	Kohlrak-Server	afaik they are trying to have it configure itself at every boot instead of using xorg.conf
2008-08-25T12:43:00.000Z	Kohlrak-Server	favro	that's stupid. The thing could never configure itself correctly in the first place. Why the heck would anyone want to not have a config file to overwrite it with? Isn't that one of the glories of linux, to modify things however you want?
2008-08-25T12:45:00.000Z	favro	Kohlrak-Server	my sentiment exactly - best its' autoconfig could give me was 640x480
2008-08-25T12:45:00.000Z	Kohlrak-Server	favro	the best it could do for me was a resolution not even supported by my card. I can't even easily describe what happens
2008-08-25T12:46:00.000Z	favro	Kohlrak-Server	hardy made me glad I back up things like xorg.conf
2008-08-25T12:47:00.000Z	Kohlrak-Server	favro	that gave me an idea... maybe i have an old xorg.conf file... But i doubt i'm that lucky
2008-08-25T12:47:00.000Z	favro	Kohlrak-Server	did you add fglrx to /etc/modules?
2008-08-25T12:52:00.000Z	favro	Kohlrak-Server	bad resolution?
2008-08-25T12:52:00.000Z	Kohlrak-Server	favro	yulp, but in the terminal =p
