2009-06-06T07:53:00.000Z	ratzes		how do i go back to factory defaults for ubuntu's theme?
2009-06-06T07:53:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ratzes	the panels?
2009-06-06T07:54:00.000Z	ratzes	sebsebseb	?
2009-06-06T07:54:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ratzes	something about theme?
2009-06-06T07:55:00.000Z	ratzes	sebsebseb	yeah, i installed a theme earlier, and then i installed a new one and i have some settings from the old theme still showing
2009-06-06T07:55:00.000Z	ratzes	sebsebseb	I installed the old theme from some new fangled theme manager
2009-06-06T07:55:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ratzes	I am pretty much the wrong person for theme questions, to be honest
2009-06-06T07:55:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ratzes	I thought you just wanted something basic like the panel resetted to defaults or to change the theme
2009-06-06T07:56:00.000Z	ratzes	sebsebseb	lol, its so much more complex than I would think it is
