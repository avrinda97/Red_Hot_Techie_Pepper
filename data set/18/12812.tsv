2006-03-20T15:56:00.000Z	chuckyp	intelikey	what are you talking about it will return the contents of hte folder
2006-03-20T15:56:00.000Z	intelikey	chuckyp	yes.   it should return the folder not the contents tho.
2006-03-20T15:57:00.000Z	chuckyp	intelikey	oh I see what you are saying.
2006-03-20T16:00:00.000Z	chuckyp	intelikey	did you copy ls -ld works fine
2006-03-20T16:01:00.000Z	chuckyp	intelikey	no its right the way it is ls lists direcotry contents
2006-03-20T16:02:00.000Z	chuckyp	intelikey	its not a bug
2006-03-20T16:02:00.000Z	intelikey	chuckyp	so it's coded to do that
2006-03-20T16:03:00.000Z	chuckyp	intelikey	ls lists directory contents  you would have to provide the -d switch now to show directories.  But youc an ask around in #ubuntu+1 but  I don't think its a bug.
2006-03-25T08:32:00.000Z	chuckyp	intelikey	not really
