2007-08-23T08:41:00.000Z	stark_		Hello everyone, could anybody help me with my problem?  I'm dual-booting Vista and Ubuntu (Feisty), with feisty on an external USB hard drive that is set first in the boot order, so apparently it shows up as hd0.  I can't seem to get Vista to boot.  Any help would be appreciated.
