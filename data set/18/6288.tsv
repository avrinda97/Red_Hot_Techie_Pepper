2008-05-29T17:13:00.000Z	anirudh0	HiTo	good luck...run it as root
2008-05-29T17:15:00.000Z	HiTo	anirudh0	thanks, will try that
2008-05-29T17:53:00.000Z	anirudh0	HiTo	by foremost?
2008-05-29T17:54:00.000Z	HiTo	anirudh0	no, I recovered some files with PhotoRec 6.8... but there are some block in the middle of the movie, and it is not even the good format
2008-05-29T17:55:00.000Z	anirudh0	HiTo	foremost only recovers what it can recover fully.
2008-05-29T17:55:00.000Z	HiTo	anirudh0	but maybe it can be corrupted no ?
2008-05-29T17:55:00.000Z	anirudh0	HiTo	what can be corrupted?
2008-05-29T17:57:00.000Z	HiTo	anirudh0	the file, as data (a little bit) was written on the disk after
2008-05-29T17:58:00.000Z	anirudh0	HiTo	i'm sorry, but i do not understand..you mean the file can be corrupted..yes it can..but foremost is your  best bet on linux
2008-05-29T17:58:00.000Z	anirudh0	HiTo	the better recovery progs are on windows though
2008-05-29T17:58:00.000Z	HiTo	anirudh0	I am reading the manual, but I don't see where I can specify the device to check
2008-05-29T17:59:00.000Z	anirudh0	HiTo	sudo foremost /dev/<device> <file-name-to-restore-to>..something like that
2008-05-29T18:01:00.000Z	HiTo	anirudh0	ok... lauching it, i will see, thanks, can easy recovery under windows recover ext2 files ?
2008-05-29T18:01:00.000Z	anirudh0	HiTo	no
2008-06-07T07:13:00.000Z	anirudh0	HiTo	use ssh -X
