2005-07-29T16:37:00.000Z	bob2	pvanhoof	yes, breezy is not ready for normal users yet
2005-07-29T16:38:00.000Z	pvanhoof	bob2	will it work?
2005-07-29T16:38:00.000Z	bob2	pvanhoof	no
2005-07-29T16:38:00.000Z	bob2	pvanhoof	read the topic, for instance
2005-07-29T16:38:00.000Z	pvanhoof	bob2	can one get it to work?
2005-07-29T16:38:00.000Z	bob2	pvanhoof	are you an ubuntu or debian developer?
2005-07-29T16:39:00.000Z	pvanhoof	bob2	assuming I am a highly experienced developer, can I get it to work after some specific tweaks? or is it totally broken (as in: reinstalling everything would take less time)
2005-07-29T16:40:00.000Z	bob2	pvanhoof	if you're a highly experienced ubuntu or debian developer, you can get it working, yes
2005-07-29T16:40:00.000Z	bob2	pvanhoof	that you're asking indicates that reinstalling would be easier
2005-07-29T16:40:00.000Z	pvanhoof	bob2	what has to be done to get it working (in case I'm highly experienced)
2005-07-29T16:40:00.000Z	bob2	pvanhoof	reading the various bug reports and ubuntu-devel archives
2005-07-29T16:41:00.000Z	pvanhoof	bob2	clearly I've probably been developing/contributing on most of the applications that you're working with atm.
2005-07-29T16:42:00.000Z	bob2	pvanhoof	I don't know the specific bug #s, sorry
2005-07-29T16:45:00.000Z	bob2	pvanhoof	#ubuntu-devel might be a better place to ask, but I don't htink anyone in the know is around atm
2005-07-29T16:51:00.000Z	bob2	pvanhoof	it may not be in any package yet
