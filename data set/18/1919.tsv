2010-10-09T10:31:00.000Z	OddJoe		hey all: how do I get sound working for a nivida 6150se +430?
2010-10-09T10:31:00.000Z	Blue1	OddJoe	hmm i think that is a graphics card
2010-10-09T10:34:00.000Z	OddJoe	Blue1	its my onboard video/sound card.
2010-10-09T10:34:00.000Z	Blue1	OddJoe	well nvida 6150 is a graphics card
2010-10-09T10:36:00.000Z	Blue1	OddJoe	maybe this?  00:04.0 PCI bridge: nVidia Corporation MCP61 PCI bridge (rev a1)
2010-10-09T10:36:00.000Z	Blue1	OddJoe	oops this:  00:05.0 Audio device: nVidia Corporation MCP61 High Definition Audio (rev a2)
2010-10-09T10:37:00.000Z	OddJoe	Blue1	How would I install that and get my sound working?
2010-10-09T10:38:00.000Z	Blue1	OddJoe	it depends on what type of sound card you have:  lspci | grep Audio
2010-10-09T10:40:00.000Z	Blue1	OddJoe	did you find your audio card?
2010-10-09T10:40:00.000Z	OddJoe	Blue1	how would I check which it is lspci or grep?
2010-10-09T10:41:00.000Z	Blue1	OddJoe	lspci | grep Audio
2010-10-09T10:41:00.000Z	Blue1	OddJoe	that's what you need just copy and paste into a terminal window, and copy and paste result back here.
2010-10-09T10:42:00.000Z	Blue1	OddJoe	okay you have the same setup I do.
2010-10-09T10:44:00.000Z	Blue1	OddJoe	10.04?  32 bit or 64 bit system?
2010-10-09T10:45:00.000Z	OddJoe	Blue1	ok, so how do I get the sound working. I also tryed the video drivers from nvidia, it gave me a X server running error.
2010-10-09T10:46:00.000Z	Blue1	OddJoe	it works right from the get go, but you should get the drivers in the repo, not the site.
2010-10-09T10:47:00.000Z	OddJoe	Blue1	where do I download the repo drivers?
2010-10-09T10:48:00.000Z	Blue1	OddJoe	System/Administration/Hardware Drivers
