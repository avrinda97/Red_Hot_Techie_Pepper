2009-06-20T20:45:00.000Z	ajax4		Can someone help me figure out why my laptop locks up when I insert my pcmcia card?
2009-06-20T20:46:00.000Z	bazhang	ajax4	hot swapping it?
2009-06-20T20:47:00.000Z	ajax4	bazhang	No, it crashes even when it boots with the card inserted.
2009-06-20T20:47:00.000Z	bazhang	ajax4	which chipset on that card
2009-06-20T20:47:00.000Z	ajax4	bazhang	How can I tell?
2009-06-20T20:48:00.000Z	bazhang	ajax4	lspci in the terminal
2009-06-20T20:49:00.000Z	ajax4	bazhang	Airgo Networks (Its a Netgear pcmcia card)
2009-06-20T20:52:00.000Z	ajax4	bazhang	I think a module is conflicting, but I can't figure out how to find out which one
2009-06-20T20:53:00.000Z	bazhang	ajax4	could well be; I had a devil of a time getting a pcmcia card to work back on Dapper (6.06)
2009-06-20T20:54:00.000Z	ajax4	bazhang	How did you eventually get it working?
2009-06-20T20:54:00.000Z	bazhang	ajax4	could you pastebin the full output for that card to paste.ubuntu.com
2009-06-20T20:54:00.000Z	ajax4	bazhang	The output of lspci?
2009-06-20T20:55:00.000Z	bazhang	ajax4	is that where it shows up? then yes
2009-06-20T20:58:00.000Z	ajax4	bazhang	paste.ubuntu.com/200135/
2009-06-20T20:58:00.000Z	bazhang	ajax4	going to search forums now
2009-06-20T20:58:00.000Z	ajax4	bazhang	I'm having to use ndiswrapper. I can install the driver, but when I put the card it the system locks up.
2009-06-20T20:59:00.000Z	ajax4	bazhang	The card is a Netgear WPNT511, if that helps.
2009-06-20T21:10:00.000Z	ajax4	bazhang	Thanks for the link. It's a ton of stuff to do but I'll try it out.
