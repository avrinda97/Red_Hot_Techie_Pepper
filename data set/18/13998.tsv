2005-09-30T11:52:00.000Z	capiCrimm		I've been having trouble getting the correct resolution in gNome. The resolution works fine on the Live CD, so is there any way I can transfer over the config files to the harddrive?
2005-09-30T11:53:00.000Z	locomorto	capiCrimm	sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2005-09-30T11:53:00.000Z	locomorto	capiCrimm	make sure your resolution is listed there
2005-09-30T11:53:00.000Z	capiCrimm	locomorto	it is, doesn't change a thing.
2005-09-30T11:54:00.000Z	locomorto	capiCrimm	make it the only one
2005-09-30T11:54:00.000Z	capiCrimm	locomorto	then it just defaults to 640
2005-09-30T11:54:00.000Z	locomorto	capiCrimm	it might have something to do with your refresh rates
2005-09-30T11:54:00.000Z	locomorto	capiCrimm	check what the correct horisontal and verticale rates are
2005-09-30T11:55:00.000Z	capiCrimm	locomorto	already did that.
2005-09-30T11:55:00.000Z	locomorto	capiCrimm	then run sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2005-09-30T11:55:00.000Z	locomorto		you need to go advanced somewhere in there
2005-09-30T11:56:00.000Z	capiCrimm	locomorto	I've done that as well. Is it possible to transfer over the setup from the live cd?
2005-09-30T11:56:00.000Z	locomorto	capiCrimm	you can mount your drive
2005-09-30T11:56:00.000Z	locomorto	capiCrimm	then copy the file i suppose
2005-09-30T11:56:00.000Z	locomorto	capiCrimm	keep a backup of your current xorg.conf though
2005-09-30T11:57:00.000Z	capiCrimm	locomorto	I'll try that, but theirs no way to do an copy of the live-cd onto the harddrive?
2005-09-30T11:58:00.000Z	locomorto	capiCrimm	that is the only thing that matters
2005-09-30T11:58:00.000Z	locomorto	capiCrimm	you can try using 3d drivers i suppose
