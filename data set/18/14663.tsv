2005-09-15T09:36:00.000Z	PovRayMan		I'm loving Ubuntu so much.
2005-09-15T09:37:00.000Z	PovRayMan		I installed 5.04 the other day and it runs like a dream.
2005-09-15T09:37:00.000Z	PovRayMan		Anyways, I've got a question.  A simple one I think :)
2005-09-15T09:37:00.000Z	dabaR	PovRayMan	but...:)
2005-09-15T09:37:00.000Z	PovRayMan	dabaR	my question is, with this upcoming 5.10 release, will i have to reinstall or will there be a simple kind of PATCH to make it all upgrade?
2005-09-15T09:38:00.000Z	dabaR	PovRayMan	that is how...and dont do it before the official release.
2005-09-15T09:39:00.000Z	PovRayMan	dabaR	ok so sometime whenever when i'm looking at the ubuntu update manager, i'll see a big ol' update?
2005-09-15T09:40:00.000Z	dabaR	PovRayMan	no, the sources need to be changed to breezy, instead of hoary.
2005-09-15T09:40:00.000Z	PovRayMan	dabaR	so that means what exactly? Sorry I'm quite the newbie to linux and i've found ubuntu to be the most awesome :)
2005-09-15T09:41:00.000Z	dabaR	PovRayMan	no need to say you are a newb, your questions will tell me that if I want to know...
2005-09-15T09:41:00.000Z	dabaR	PovRayMan	did you get the message from ubotu?
2005-09-15T09:41:00.000Z	dabaR	PovRayMan	ubotu is a bot, send a message to the channel as so: /msg ubotu upgrade2breezy
2005-09-15T09:44:00.000Z	dabaR	PovRayMan	there is a file, /etc/apt/sources.list. It contains a list of repositories from which you can install files. It can be manually edited, or you can use synaptic, or apt-get to edit it for you. Your current sources.list has hoary as the version. When the time comes, you change that to breezy, and do the 3 button dance in synaptic. reload, mark all upgrades(or so, I dont use it) and apply.
2005-09-15T09:44:00.000Z	PovRayMan	dabaR	badass, i get it now.  Thanks :)
2005-10-24T07:57:00.000Z	dabaR	PovRayMan	did you read the topic? is it gpg or 404 errors?
2005-10-24T07:58:00.000Z	dabaR	PovRayMan	thats fine.
2005-10-24T08:16:00.000Z	PovRayMan	dabaR	ok, I think I got update-manager changed from the US server to a mirror, I didn't get any gpg or 404 errors
2005-10-24T08:16:00.000Z	dabaR	PovRayMan	$20
