2010-05-15T19:37:00.000Z	Marco___		could it be an ATI issue?

2010-05-15T19:50:00.000Z	actionparsnip	Marco___	you could chroot to the installed system and install a different WM there
2010-05-15T19:51:00.000Z	Marco___	actionparsnip	you mean now, from livecd?
2010-05-15T19:51:00.000Z	actionparsnip	Marco___	sure, thats one of the great things of linux
