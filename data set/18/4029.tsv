2010-03-19T17:54:00.000Z	AceKing		I'm trying to help my brother with his laptop. He's running 9.04 on his laptop, and when he starts his laptop it just shows lines going across and wont boot to the desktop. Any ideas?
2010-03-19T17:55:00.000Z	dsnyders	AceKing	sounds like the xwindows resolution is fouled up.
2010-03-19T17:56:00.000Z	AceKing	dsnyders	is there a way to fix it? I can boot into live CD
2010-03-19T17:57:00.000Z	dsnyders	AceKing	When the laptop starts can you use CTRL-ALT-F1 to get to a console?
2010-03-19T17:58:00.000Z	AceKing	dsnyders	I'm going to try right now
2010-03-19T17:59:00.000Z	AceKing	dsnyders	I'm at the grub menu. Is that where I'm supposed to be?
2010-03-19T18:00:00.000Z	dsnyders	AceKing	No, where you get those lines you were talking about.
2010-03-19T18:02:00.000Z	AceKing	dsnyders	I just tried. After I get to the part with the lines and what looks like Chinese writing across the top, I tried CTRL - ALT - F1 and nothing happened
2010-03-19T18:03:00.000Z	dsnyders	AceKing	Is the laptop on a network?  Can you ping it?
2010-03-19T18:04:00.000Z	AceKing	dsnyders	I do have it plugged into my router, but how would I find it's IP address?
2010-03-19T18:05:00.000Z	dsnyders	AceKing	nevermind that now.  What happens when you type ALT-SYSRQ-K?
2010-03-19T18:06:00.000Z	AceKing	dsnyders	nothing happened
2010-03-19T18:10:00.000Z	dsnyders	AceKing	I don't know how far into the linux startup your machine is getting.
2010-03-19T18:10:00.000Z	AceKing	dsnyders	do you think I need to re-install
2010-03-19T18:11:00.000Z	AceKing	dsnyders	after the grub menu, it flashes the lines for about 10 seconds or so
2010-03-19T18:12:00.000Z	dsnyders	AceKing	did you see eremite's comment to me?
2010-03-19T18:15:00.000Z	dsnyders	AceKing	I'm going to leave you in eremite's hands.  I have to go to work... at least until I pick up my lottery winnings :-)
2010-03-19T18:16:00.000Z	AceKing	dsnyders	thank you for helping
