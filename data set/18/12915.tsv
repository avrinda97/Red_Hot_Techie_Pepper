2006-02-24T07:11:00.000Z	minimec	BDC	THX. Do they work with the Kismet-Software?
2006-02-24T07:12:00.000Z	BDC	minimec	kismet? forgive my ignorance
2006-02-24T07:13:00.000Z	minimec	BDC	Kismet is a wifi software which allows you to see (and use) the wifi-Networks around you ... ;-)
2006-02-24T07:14:00.000Z	minimec	BDC	some kind of wifi-radar ...
2006-02-24T07:14:00.000Z	BDC	minimec	the vaio with the atheros is on, let me do a quick apt-get
2006-02-24T07:15:00.000Z	minimec	BDC	It needs some config!!!
2006-02-24T07:16:00.000Z	BDC	minimec	so i see, reading the man page now
2006-02-24T07:16:00.000Z	minimec	BDC	You have to modify the config file and enter your card... It's explained in the config file...
2006-02-24T07:19:00.000Z	minimec	BDC	So your Vaio is running well on Linux. I always thought, that the Vaio were normally not 100% compatible with Linux.
2006-02-24T07:21:00.000Z	BDC	minimec	the vaio runs better under linux than it did XP, it was originally a 2K machine and the drivers for all the extra stuff (jog dial, memory stick slot, etc) never worked under XP - ubuntu found everything right at the get go!
2006-02-24T07:21:00.000Z	minimec	BDC	Cool :-)
2006-02-24T07:22:00.000Z	BDC	minimec	kismet looks like something I should play with when I have more time, thins might be of interest though http://kerneltrap.org/node/5414
2006-02-24T07:23:00.000Z	minimec	BDC	No Problem. I thank you. I am happy to hear that both cards work.
2006-02-24T07:23:00.000Z	minimec		as?
2006-02-24T07:23:00.000Z	minimec		as?
2006-02-24T07:25:00.000Z	BDC	minimec	my pleasure, good luck
2006-02-24T07:26:00.000Z	minimec	BDC	Thanks for the Link. I have the same 'monitor'-problem with a Cisco pcmcia wifi b Card :-)
