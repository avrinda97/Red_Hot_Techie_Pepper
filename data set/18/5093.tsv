2008-12-14T13:58:00.000Z	Mad_Wifi_er		Anybody that's been able to set up Ubuntu as a wireless access point?
2008-12-14T13:59:00.000Z	rdw200169	Mad_Wifi_er	it's possible, depends mostly on the wireless card
2008-12-14T13:59:00.000Z	Mad_Wifi_er	rdw200169	I've got an Atheros. Actually, it works now, except I can't figure out how to turn on WEP
2008-12-14T14:00:00.000Z	Mad_Wifi_er	rdw200169	Do you know about setting up /etc/networking/interfaces? I think the problem must be there.
2008-12-14T14:01:00.000Z	rdw200169	Mad_Wifi_er	yes, but you don't need to worry about it
2008-12-14T14:01:00.000Z	rdw200169	Mad_Wifi_er	skip networking for now
2008-12-14T14:01:00.000Z	rdw200169	Mad_Wifi_er	get windows installed and running
2008-12-14T14:01:00.000Z	Mad_Wifi_er	rdw200169	ok, where should I look?
2008-12-14T14:02:00.000Z	Mad_Wifi_er	rdw200169	you mean the GUI?
2008-12-14T14:02:00.000Z	rdw200169	Mad_Wifi_er	seen this? https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/WirelessAccessPoint
2008-12-14T14:06:00.000Z	Mad_Wifi_er	rdw200169	thanks, I've done some of what's explained in that document, but there's no discussion of WEP -- that's where I'm stuck
2008-12-14T14:06:00.000Z	rdw200169	Mad_Wifi_er	i don't know what to say on that regard :(
2008-12-14T14:07:00.000Z	Mad_Wifi_er	rdw200169	ok, thanks
2008-12-14T14:07:00.000Z	rdw200169	Mad_Wifi_er	at least you can add yourself to the small list of people who actually pulled of the tricky 'Master Mode'
2008-12-14T14:08:00.000Z	Mad_Wifi_er	rdw200169	heh, yeah but don't ask how long it took me to get that far ;)
2008-12-14T14:09:00.000Z	rdw200169	Mad_Wifi_er	i would have just used a cheap wireless router ;)
2008-12-14T14:09:00.000Z	rdw200169	Mad_Wifi_er	and set it up in 'switch mode'
2008-12-14T14:09:00.000Z	rdw200169	Mad_Wifi_er	to piggy back off my desktop's network on the other interface
