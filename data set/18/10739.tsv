2006-10-29T12:25:00.000Z	KenThomson	rbil	Thank you for helping me, i am hoping-over to that link
2006-10-29T12:25:00.000Z	rbil	KenThomson	Q2, not needed, Linux knows how to handle ram
2006-10-29T12:26:00.000Z	rbil	KenThomson	Q4 start here: http://rute.2038bug.com/rute.html.gz
2006-10-29T12:26:00.000Z	KenThomson	rbil	Linux knows but what about some other stubborn programs, or if i see a really long video in Google, most of it is cached and stores in the swap or RAM, so i need to clear it up, Don't you think so?
2006-10-29T12:29:00.000Z	rbil	KenThomson	believe me, coming from the Windoze world you'll be absolutely blown away about all the quality oss software available for Linux
2006-10-29T12:31:00.000Z	KenThomson	rbil	Thank you
2006-10-29T12:31:00.000Z	rbil	KenThomson	you're welcome. one step at a time. believe me you'll learn to appreciate using a real operating system
2006-10-29T12:36:00.000Z	rbil	KenThomson	when Ubuntu installs it'll take care of it. ext3 for / and a swap partition will be created automatically. Windows partition will be resized. Or you can use that utility (bootable cd) to first resize what you want. Just leave empty space on hd for Ubuntu to use
2006-10-29T12:37:00.000Z	rbil	KenThomson	and forget about lettered drives like C, D, etc. Linux doesn't use that silliness. All drives will be mounted under your main file structure in Linux.
2006-10-29T12:40:00.000Z	rbil	KenThomson	I wouldn't even if it was possible
2006-10-29T12:40:00.000Z	KenThomson	rbil	So do i have a choice in which directory or logical drive or folder (i dont know what to call it in Linux), i install new programs from ubuntu?
2006-10-29T12:41:00.000Z	rbil	KenThomson	not usually, it puts them automatically where they should be
2006-10-29T12:42:00.000Z	rbil	KenThomson	it's application installation is way ahead of anything Windoze offers, it's like comparing Photoshop to an Etch-A-Sketch
2006-10-29T12:45:00.000Z	KenThomson	rbil	So than what type of partition should i use for my aforementioned requirement?
2006-10-29T12:46:00.000Z	rbil	KenThomson	don't worry about, the installation will take care of what you need in terms of Linux requirements.
2006-10-29T12:46:00.000Z	rbil	KenThomson	for Windoze requirements you know what you need and that is no concern of Linux.
2006-10-29T12:50:00.000Z	rbil	KenThomson	use FAT32 to share data between the 2 os's
