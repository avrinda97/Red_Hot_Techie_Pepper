2011-01-14T00:02:00.000Z	bluezone		I am trying to mount iso in the format mount -t type device location, what exactly is the device? the file name?
2011-01-14T00:02:00.000Z	bluezone		lol
2011-01-14T00:04:00.000Z	puff	bluezone	usually it's /dev/something
2011-01-14T00:05:00.000Z	puff	bluezone	Doh... wait, mounting an iso, right, path to file.
2011-01-14T00:06:00.000Z	puff	bluezone	Btw, right-click on an empty spot in the gnome menubar, select "add to panel", and select the Disk Mounter applet.
2011-01-14T00:08:00.000Z	puff	bluezone	mount point is the spot in the file system hierarchy that you want the device to show up.
2011-01-14T00:09:00.000Z	puff	bluezone	Usually you have to do:  1) $ mkdir /home/bluezone/myisomountpoint
2011-01-14T00:09:00.000Z	puff	bluezone	2) mount -o loop /home/bluezone/my.iso /home/bluezone/myisomountpoint
2011-01-14T00:10:00.000Z	bluezone	puff	this even more complicated because im trying to get these to run on wine lol
2011-01-14T00:10:00.000Z	bluezone	puff	so maybe the mount point must be somwhere in /.wine/...
2011-01-14T00:10:00.000Z	puff	bluezone	Now you're outside my area of knowledge, haven't mucked with wine at ll.
2011-01-14T00:10:00.000Z	bluezone	puff	hehe
2011-01-14T00:11:00.000Z	puff	bluezone	Btw, also check out Pysdm, a GUI tool to help manage mounting.  Don't know if it handles isos.
2011-01-14T00:12:00.000Z	bluezone	puff	i think i got it
2011-01-14T00:13:00.000Z	bluezone	puff	yeah i had to mount it to /home/bluezone/.wine
2011-01-14T00:13:00.000Z	bluezone	puff	then it appeared on the mounter on gnome
2011-01-14T00:13:00.000Z	bluezone	puff	thanks
2011-01-14T00:42:00.000Z	bluezone	puff	hehe, im so proud of myself now, diablo is working flawlessly! thanks man
