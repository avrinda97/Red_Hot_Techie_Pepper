2010-06-25T06:02:00.000Z	dominicdinada	phong_	copy ur webfiles there
2010-06-25T06:06:00.000Z	dominicdinada	phong_	in your permissions
2010-06-25T06:06:00.000Z	dominicdinada	phong_	Privladges then look at those settings
2010-06-25T06:07:00.000Z	dominicdinada	phong_	 root localhost No  ALL PRIVILEGES Yes 
2010-06-25T06:08:00.000Z	dominicdinada	phong_	as a suggestion in a secure enviroment you should only allow a user as much access as needed... not just blindly allow everything :D but thats another story :D
2010-06-25T06:10:00.000Z	dominicdinada	phong_	that is alot of data
2010-06-25T06:17:00.000Z	dominicdinada	phong_	if it is a local network as i said before you can just use places/connect to a server/ssh into your server
2010-06-25T06:19:00.000Z	dominicdinada	phong_	once you create the user you need to give permissions to such user
