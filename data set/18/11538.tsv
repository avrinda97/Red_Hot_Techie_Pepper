2006-08-04T11:51:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE		whats the best fastest most up to date, why use ext2,3
2006-08-04T11:52:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE		really
2006-08-04T11:52:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE		anyone else
2006-08-04T11:54:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE		what is the best fs ext2/3, reserfs, xfs....
2006-08-04T11:55:00.000Z	Blissex	Paddy_EIRE	very very silly question! They all have very different ''optimal'' situations...
2006-08-04T11:55:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	Blissex	explain
2006-08-04T11:56:00.000Z	Blissex	Paddy_EIRE	a bit like asking ''what's the best desk editor'' or ''what's the best distro''. try to say what you expect to do with it. Like filesystem size, type of PC, files, ...
2006-08-04T11:56:00.000Z	Blissex	Paddy_EIRE	for example, XFS is best for very large RAID storage systems, ReiserFS for lots of very small files, and so on...
2006-08-04T11:58:00.000Z	Blissex	Paddy_EIRE	how large? Just your own PC, desktop usage? Do you dual boot to MS Windows?
2006-08-04T12:00:00.000Z	Blissex	Paddy_EIRE	however the usual general ''all purpose'' filesystems are 'ext3' and JFS. I think that JFS is somewhat better performance than 'ext3'. However 'ext3' is MS Windows compatible.
2006-08-04T12:00:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	Blissex	i want to dual boot windows 2000 ntfs with ubuntu both on same drive
2006-08-04T12:01:00.000Z	Blissex	Paddy_EIRE	then got for 'ext3' and use this driver under MS Windows: http://FS-Driver.org/
