2005-12-14T15:29:00.000Z	ompaul	MrBlowtatoes	well I would not do it then, as sarge was released later than 5.10 iirc
2005-12-14T15:28:00.000Z	ompaul	MrBlowtatoes	which debian are you running expermential or woody/sarge?
2005-12-14T15:30:00.000Z	ompaul	MrBlowtatoes	if you were on woody I would say fire away

2005-12-14T15:34:00.000Z	ompaul	MrBlowtatoes	really I would d/l a cd called kubuntu and install from scratch
2005-12-14T15:34:00.000Z	ompaul	MrBlowtatoes	ubuntu is gnome
2005-12-14T15:35:00.000Z	ompaul	MrBlowtatoes	yeap
2005-12-14T15:40:00.000Z	ompaul	MrBlowtatoes	when did you order
2005-12-14T15:41:00.000Z	ompaul	MrBlowtatoes	a couple of weeks - but you got christmas in there - so that will do some damage to any projection I make
2005-12-14T15:41:00.000Z	ompaul	MrBlowtatoes	you must know someone with a burner
2005-12-14T15:43:00.000Z	ompaul	MrBlowtatoes	that is everything which you don't have of debian either not the minimum
2005-12-14T15:47:00.000Z	ompaul	MrBlowtatoes	have some qualms cos it will not be a really useful system
2005-12-14T15:48:00.000Z	ompaul	MrBlowtatoes	iirc it is 1.8G for the minimum that leaves you with 200M for yourself to play with
2005-12-14T15:50:00.000Z	ompaul	MrBlowtatoes	to do that you need to do server install and then kubuntu-desktop if you use a CD and as this is all ifs and ands get a CD and talk to us about what to do before you launch into the install
2005-12-14T15:51:00.000Z	ompaul	MrBlowtatoes	sit back wait when you have them then we can help you more
2005-12-14T15:54:00.000Z	ompaul	MrBlowtatoes	at this stage it is a conversation please take it to #ubuntu-offtopic
2005-12-14T15:54:00.000Z	ompaul	MrBlowtatoes	night
