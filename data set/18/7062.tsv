2011-10-14T20:06:00.000Z	graingert	shaye	what does that mean?
2011-10-14T20:07:00.000Z	graingert	shaye	laptops can't hook wirelessly to operating systems so that's WAD
2011-10-14T20:08:00.000Z	graingert	shaye	no it didn't. it connected to a wireless network. Your laptop did not, however, hook wirelessly with mint"
2011-10-14T20:08:00.000Z	graingert	shaye	did you try running jocky-gtk
2011-10-14T20:09:00.000Z	graingert	shaye	okay well have you got a connection?
2011-10-14T20:09:00.000Z	graingert	shaye	and how did you "load the brodcom drivers"
2011-10-14T20:09:00.000Z	graingert	shaye	run jocky-gtk
2011-10-14T20:12:00.000Z	graingert	shaye	pastebin the output of the command "lsusb" and send me the link
