2008-07-02T08:28:00.000Z	Jester45	Fryguy--	do you have a suggestion for a language closest to bash? i love bash but really cant get into any "real" programing languages
2008-07-02T08:29:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Jester45	bash isn't a language, it's a shell
2008-07-02T08:29:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Jester45	bash is a general purpose script for facilitating command languages, it has pretty much nothing in common with programming languages
2008-07-02T08:29:00.000Z	Jester45	Fryguy--	are there any languages close to it's syntax?
2008-07-02T08:29:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Jester45	no
2008-07-02T08:31:00.000Z	Jester45	Fryguy--	i know what it is... its the same as running repeated comands in the temrinal but with the number of languages one of them should be close to bash
2008-07-02T10:09:00.000Z	Jester45	Fryguy--	not to gang up on you but my has the option do to that (i keep it disabled)
2008-07-02T10:09:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Jester45	sure, and it's disabled by default on every router
2008-07-03T08:56:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Jester45	it also mounts to non-empty directories :)
2008-07-03T08:57:00.000Z	Jester45	Fryguy--	why would you want to be doing that
2008-07-03T08:57:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Jester45	i do it at work to shadow a local home directory with an nfs mounted home directory. If our network ever goes down, I still have at least a barebones usable home directory so the machine is "usable"
2008-07-03T08:58:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Jester45	not in 7.10 it's not
2008-07-06T09:53:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Jester45	make -j5
2008-07-06T09:54:00.000Z	Jester45	Fryguy--	is is possible to set a config or enviromental varible so that make will use that option? i have 2x dual cores but compiling on only 1 is rather anyoing
2008-07-07T09:49:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Jester45	it can, take a look at the command line options for it.  I would recommend using one of the more popular virtualization platforms though, they are typically much better than qemu
2008-07-07T09:51:00.000Z	Jester45	Fryguy--	im running it on a headless server so... vbox and vmware is kinda out i know vbox has a cli but i prefer qemu's. im not talking about guest smp i mean the host is smp but qemu uses just 1
2008-07-07T09:51:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Jester45	ok, like i said i'm pretty sure there's a command line option to dedicate more cores.  check out qemu's wiki
