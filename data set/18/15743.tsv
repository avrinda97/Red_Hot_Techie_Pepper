2005-04-20T16:28:00.000Z	theine	kakalto	don't link from /etc/rc2.d to /usr/local/bin
2005-04-20T16:28:00.000Z	theine	kakalto	that's very non-standard and doesn't wotrk together with update-rc.d
2005-04-20T16:31:00.000Z	theine	kakalto	who thinks it's a text document?
2005-04-20T16:32:00.000Z	theine	kakalto	"executable text documents" are called scripts...
2005-04-20T16:32:00.000Z	kakalto	theine	scripts don't automatically open in a txt editor
2005-04-20T16:33:00.000Z	theine	kakalto	when you click on them in nautilus or what?
2005-04-20T16:35:00.000Z	theine	kakalto	it opens in a txt editor on startup???
2005-04-20T16:35:00.000Z	theine	kakalto	what are you talking about?
2005-04-20T16:37:00.000Z	theine	kakalto	.sh
2005-04-20T16:37:00.000Z	theine	kakalto	i.e. jinputx.sh
2005-04-20T16:38:00.000Z	theine	kakalto	it would be very strange if KDE requires the scripts in autostart to have a .sh extension...
2005-04-20T16:38:00.000Z	theine	kakalto	but it's worth a try I guess...
2005-04-20T16:39:00.000Z	theine	kakalto	what does jinputx do btw?
2005-04-20T16:39:00.000Z	kakalto	theine	it's a small script to run kinput2 -canna for japanese writing support
2005-04-20T16:40:00.000Z	theine	kakalto	ah, i see
2005-04-20T16:40:00.000Z	theine	kakalto	so it the reason why it wasn't working really was the missing .sh extension?
2005-04-30T15:12:00.000Z	kakalto	theine	no, breezy
2005-04-30T15:12:00.000Z	theine	kakalto	I thought that's going to be 2.12...
