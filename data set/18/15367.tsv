2005-06-28T10:58:00.000Z	dockane		maybe a stupid question: on bash i called a 2 liner with "cursor up" from history and see that i don like to use. what tha sortest way to get rid of it and clean the prompt from it ?
2005-06-28T11:00:00.000Z	pestilence	dockane	rm .bash_history ?
2005-06-28T11:03:00.000Z	dockane	pestilence	ehhm ok that would delete the history, but i all i would like to do it somehting like "end", "shift+pos1" & "del"
2005-06-28T11:04:00.000Z	pestilence	dockane	i don't understand.
2005-06-28T11:04:00.000Z	dockane	pestilence	backspace untill each chaacter gets deleted takes a while and deleting just a few charakter and pressing enter is no good idea
2005-06-28T11:05:00.000Z	pestilence	dockane	learn emacs, or switch to vi mode if you know vi
2005-06-28T11:05:00.000Z	pestilence		the default mode for the shell in ubuntu is emacs, so emacs shortcuts should work
2005-06-28T11:07:00.000Z	dockane	pestilence	i don't know what irc client you are using (probably irssi if you recommend vi and emacs ;) but pressing shitf+pos1 i.e. in xchat highlits the complete line (which then can get erased with one button)
2005-06-28T11:08:00.000Z	pestilence	dockane	ah.  i really was not understanding what you wanted to do
2005-06-28T11:08:00.000Z	pestilence		thought you were asking about the command line
2005-06-28T11:09:00.000Z	pestilence		since you asked about "bash"
2005-06-28T11:09:00.000Z	dockane	pestilence	so my first question was what is the quickest way to red of a 2 liner in bash.
2005-06-28T11:09:00.000Z	dockane		*rid
2005-06-28T11:10:00.000Z	pestilence	dockane	which is why i suggested learning emacs commands
2005-06-28T11:10:00.000Z	pestilence	dockane	i believe it's ctrl+A or ctrl+U or ctrl+u.  but not sure.
2005-06-28T11:10:00.000Z	pestilence	dockane	i use vi mode, which is different.
2005-06-28T11:12:00.000Z	dockane	pestilence	i think i've just realised that using one the editors is not just editing but juggle with the cursor on a terminal
2005-06-28T11:13:00.000Z	pestilence	dockane	perhaps i'm just tired, but i have a really hard time parsing that.
