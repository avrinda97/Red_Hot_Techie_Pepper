2007-06-21T15:46:00.000Z	ipx		How can I convert a debian .deb to feisty?
2007-06-21T15:47:00.000Z	persica	ipx	.debs are what feisty uses.  feisty just officially includes specific versions of those packages.
2007-06-21T15:47:00.000Z	persica	ipx	try 'sudo dpkg -i <package.deb>'
2007-06-21T15:48:00.000Z	ipx	persica	ive been looking for a feisty version of bmpx, and cant find any. When I tried to compile by source, it wanted boostlib to be installed but cant seem to install that one either. :/
2007-06-21T15:49:00.000Z	ipx	persica	got ALOT of dependency-problems while trying to use that .deb-file written for debian
2007-06-21T15:50:00.000Z	persica	ipx	hrm.  I'm not familiar with bmpx, or where you got the deb.
2007-06-21T15:50:00.000Z	ipx	persica	seems that alot of versions was too old for it, but my feisty system is up-to-date
2007-06-21T15:50:00.000Z	ipx	persica	allright
2007-06-21T15:51:00.000Z	persica	ipx	what's the difference between bmpx and bmp?
2007-06-21T15:52:00.000Z	persica	ipx	what's wrong with the beep-media-player package in the repos?
2007-06-21T15:52:00.000Z	ipx	persica	bmpx is the new version of it, http://ftp.debian.org/debian/pool/main/b/bmpx/bmpx_0.36.1-3_i386.deb
2007-06-21T15:53:00.000Z	ipx	persica	i want the new version, of course
2007-06-21T15:53:00.000Z	persica	ipx	ah.  hrm.  they you may have a lot of dependencies to resolve.
2007-06-21T15:53:00.000Z	ipx	persica	its totally rewritten with new functions and i can use a plugin to show what song im listening on in xchat
2007-06-21T15:56:00.000Z	ipx	persica	DrFrasierCrane: Do you think i can add edgy repos into a feisty machine and test?
2007-06-21T15:56:00.000Z	persica	ipx	yeah, you could, but if it's not in feisty it won't be in edgy, will it?
2007-06-21T15:57:00.000Z	ipx	persica	its not in edgys repos, its third party repos
2007-06-21T15:57:00.000Z	ipx	persica	made for edgy
