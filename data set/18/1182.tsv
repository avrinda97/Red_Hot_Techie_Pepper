2011-05-09T13:59:00.000Z	yagoo	OO2u	edid is autodetected by the X server..
2011-05-09T14:00:00.000Z	yagoo	OO2u	if u use something like a kvm switch that can interfere with edid
2011-05-09T14:00:00.000Z	OO2u	yagoo	the problem is that nvidia driver cannot detect this information. So i must set up it manualy
2011-05-09T14:00:00.000Z	yagoo	OO2u	what's between the monitor and the video card?
2011-05-09T14:01:00.000Z	OO2u	yagoo	edid channel
2011-05-09T14:01:00.000Z	yagoo	OO2u	is there anything other than a direct cable? (like as i said no kvm switches?)
