2008-11-04T09:03:00.000Z	ldiamond		My networking is down. It worked fine last time I used it but now I cant connect. (I'm connected to another router now, but the router is fine.)
2008-11-04T09:04:00.000Z	ldiamond		Anyone know how I can get the log of what's failing when I try to connect to my router?
2008-11-04T09:06:00.000Z	ldiamond		Can anyone tell me where I can find the log of my wired connection? It fails to connect to my router.

2008-12-06T08:38:00.000Z	ldiamond	Pelo	now its time to make it faster and get rid of everything you dont need... that should take some of your time.

2008-12-06T08:40:00.000Z	ldiamond	Pelo	as an example, an hour ago, I left my PC unattended for about 30 mins, the screen saver went on (blank screen), I could never recover, had to shutdown.

2008-12-06T08:41:00.000Z	Pelo	ldiamond	are yo sure it's the screensaver that crashes your comp and not  suspend ?
2008-12-06T08:41:00.000Z	ldiamond	Pelo	my comp doesnt suspend.
