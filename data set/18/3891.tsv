2009-10-03T00:39:00.000Z	Ali_nz		how do I install a package?
2009-10-03T00:39:00.000Z	Ali_nz		I have expanded it
2009-10-03T00:39:00.000Z	LjL	Ali_nz	you have what?
2009-10-03T00:40:00.000Z	Ali_nz	LjL	yeah i read that
2009-10-03T00:40:00.000Z	Ali_nz	LjL	yeah i read that but it doesnt seem to apply to what I have (a directory with RealVNC expanded)
2009-10-03T00:41:00.000Z	Ali_nz	LjL	I think I need to go to something like ./install ?
2009-10-03T00:41:00.000Z	LjL	Ali_nz	that is not a "package"
2009-10-03T00:41:00.000Z	Ali_nz	LjL	ahh - shows how much i know
2009-10-03T00:42:00.000Z	LjL	Ali_nz	can't you use one of the VNC software that is actually in the repositories instead?
2009-10-03T00:42:00.000Z	Ali_nz	LjL	I could, but I know realVNC much better
2009-10-03T00:42:00.000Z	LjL	Ali_nz	there are no universal instructions for installing random stuff from the web - doesn't it come with a readme file?
2009-10-03T00:43:00.000Z	LjL	Ali_nz	then type sudo ./vncinstall /usr/local/bin
2009-10-03T00:44:00.000Z	LjL	Ali_nz	now it's probably installed, i guess?
2009-10-03T00:45:00.000Z	Ali_nz	LjL	yeah but how to run it?
2009-10-03T00:45:00.000Z	LjL	Ali_nz	i haven't a clue.
2009-10-03T00:45:00.000Z	LjL	Ali_nz	but the instructions will cover that, no?
2009-10-03T00:45:00.000Z	Ali_nz	LjL	would I need to cd to usr/local/bin?
2009-10-03T00:46:00.000Z	LjL	Ali_nz	probably not, it'll be in thepath
