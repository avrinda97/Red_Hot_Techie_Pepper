2009-08-11T22:46:00.000Z	Capoochino		I love to use Ubuntu, but I am afraid that it is too hard to use for most nignogs
2009-08-11T22:46:00.000Z	Capoochino		Since their bell curve is centered on an IQ of 80
2009-08-11T22:46:00.000Z	Capoochino		referring to the typical black person
2009-08-11T22:47:00.000Z	Halitech	Capoochino	what does the color of a persons skin, their sex or anything else have to do with if they can use ubuntu?
2009-08-11T22:47:00.000Z	Capoochino	Halitech	there is much more to race than the color of skin
2009-08-11T22:47:00.000Z	Capoochino		for example propensity for sickle cell
2009-08-11T22:47:00.000Z	Capoochino		brain size
2009-08-11T22:48:00.000Z	Capoochino		hair texture
2009-08-11T22:48:00.000Z	Capoochino		body structure
2009-08-11T22:48:00.000Z	Halitech	Capoochino	so you are saying people of African descent are stupid?
2009-08-11T22:48:00.000Z	Capoochino		hence most negroes are too dense in mass to swim
2009-08-11T22:48:00.000Z	Capoochino		not all
2009-08-11T22:48:00.000Z	Capoochino		some are rather smart
2009-08-11T22:48:00.000Z	Capoochino		but on average they are
2009-08-11T22:49:00.000Z	Capoochino		ok
2009-08-11T22:49:00.000Z	Capoochino		but is there any kind of demographic study for Ubuntu usage?
2009-08-11T22:49:00.000Z	Halitech	Capoochino	not to dispute your 'findings' but pretty well all of the colored people I know are smarter then the average white person I know
