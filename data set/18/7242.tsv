2009-10-21T14:24:00.000Z	Xtreme_Great		And since we're on a lan, on wan side, we
2009-10-21T14:24:00.000Z	Xtreme_Great		are supposed to have the same ID.

2009-10-21T14:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Xtreme_Great	irc allows spawning and destruction of channels
2009-10-21T14:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Xtreme_Great	just join a randomly named channel and it will be made
2009-10-21T14:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Xtreme_Great	you would be
2009-10-21T14:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Xtreme_Great	and if yuo use tab you can complete my name quicker and accurately
2009-10-21T14:35:00.000Z	Xtreme_Great	ActionParsnip	Oh, I can train him offline. That's not the problem. But I want it to know about different kinds of people.

2009-10-21T14:36:00.000Z	Xtreme_Great	ActionParsnip	Awesome! Now here comes the problem....
2009-10-21T14:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Xtreme_Great	why is that a problem?
2009-10-21T14:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Xtreme_Great	then you need to tweak more
2009-10-21T14:38:00.000Z	Xtreme_Great	ActionParsnip	And does not work with any commands listed in the source. Of course, I didn't read the whole source yet.
2009-10-21T14:38:00.000Z	Xtreme_Great	ActionParsnip	Then it seems, it's going to be quite some work trying to tweak it.
2009-10-21T14:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Xtreme_Great	then setting up the channel to test something you know is broken is pointless
