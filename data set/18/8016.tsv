2008-07-15T08:38:00.000Z	nickrud	LSD|Ninja	put in ""
2008-07-15T08:38:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	nickrud	thanks
2008-07-18T07:01:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	nickrud	adding the repo will make it easier for updates though
2008-07-18T07:01:00.000Z	nickrud	LSD|Ninja	how often do they get updated ;) Every two years or so?
2008-07-18T07:02:00.000Z	nickrud	LSD|Ninja	ffmpeg or something, maybe.
2008-09-18T08:23:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	nickrud	Ubuntu is better than a lot of distros wrt wireless. Wireless troubles aren't a problem unique to Ubuntu, it affects Linux as a whole
2008-09-18T08:23:00.000Z	nickrud	LSD|Ninja	yeah, I should have said linux instead of ubuntu.
2008-09-18T08:23:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	nickrud	With the right chip, It's install and go with wireless on Ubuntu
2008-09-18T08:23:00.000Z	nickrud	LSD|Ninja	yep. Read back for my experience ;)
2008-09-18T08:25:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	nickrud	5007 is a newer one, it's not entirely Ubuntu's fault for the trouble there
2008-09-18T08:26:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	nickrud	b/g Atheros are usually fine
2008-09-18T08:26:00.000Z	nickrud	LSD|Ninja	no, it's not anyone's fault, but we see the problem here. (or if anyone's, the manufacturer for releasing out of ubuntu schedule ;)
2008-09-18T08:27:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	nickrud	I said not entirely Ubuntu's fault. ubuntu didn't bump madwifi between Gutsy and Hardy so a few Atheros chips that should have been supported weren't. The drivers are also going through a change upstream. Hopefully though, it'll be mostly sorted out by Intrepid
2008-09-18T08:28:00.000Z	nickrud	LSD|Ninja	could you look at his lspci, http://paste.ubuntu.com/47951/ , I don't recognize a wireless chipset there
2008-09-18T08:30:00.000Z	nickrud	LSD|Ninja	I see that as just a normal problem of the release cycle. stable releases have strong pluses, and some annoying drawbacks regarding recent software. Since I'm here, you know what I find more important
2008-11-17T11:46:00.000Z	nickrud	LSD|Ninja	gnome-display-properties ?
2008-11-17T11:46:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	nickrud	Doesn't work. Never has. That was why displyconfig-gtk was so awesome.
