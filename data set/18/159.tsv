2012-07-15T20:07:00.000Z	Witewolf	pckchem	Unfortunately I can't remove the security from the router.
2012-07-15T20:12:00.000Z	Witewolf	pckchem	give me just a sec and I will.
2012-07-15T20:15:00.000Z	Witewolf	pckchem	Here ya go, http://pastebin.com/26U9y2p9
2012-07-15T20:23:00.000Z	Witewolf	pckchem	By the way, that dmesg was while it is connected to the internet
2012-07-15T20:26:00.000Z	Witewolf	pckchem	Sure thing, might take me a little bit but will get back to you asap.
2012-07-15T20:32:00.000Z	Witewolf	pckchem	Just my luck, I am not having an issue connecting, or having it drop. I connect, and it connects right up. Usually it takes a couple tries.
2012-07-15T20:33:00.000Z	Witewolf	pckchem	Let me try rebooting the machine, and see if the problem comes back. If it does, I will pastebin the syslog.txt file

2012-07-15T20:52:00.000Z	Witewolf	pckchem	ok
2012-07-15T20:53:00.000Z	Witewolf	pckchem	No worries.
2012-07-15T21:11:00.000Z	Witewolf	pckchem	Yes
2012-07-15T21:18:00.000Z	Witewolf	pckchem	No, I couldn't get it to connect... sometimes it takes hours to try and connect... so I just let it sit there trying to connect for the data log.
2012-07-15T21:27:00.000Z	Witewolf	pckchem	Take your time, I appreciate the help.
2012-07-15T21:33:00.000Z	Witewolf	pckchem	Ok, let me boot into Linux really quick, then will hop over once I send it and give you the number.
2012-07-15T21:36:00.000Z	Witewolf	pckchem	What was the command again? And do I enter it in this channel? Or where? Lol, I'm confused.
2012-07-15T21:44:00.000Z	Witewolf	pckchem	What exactly do I do again? Lol, totally got lost.
