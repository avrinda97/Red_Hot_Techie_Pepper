2007-10-22T13:49:00.000Z	beernutz		anyone know how to fix the white screen issue trying to run compiz under a freshly upgraded gutsy install with nvidia drivers?
2007-10-22T13:50:00.000Z	Jordan_U	beernutz	Complain to Nvidia to get their drivers fixed or open sourced
2007-10-22T13:50:00.000Z	beernutz	Jordan_U	is that really the issue?
2007-10-22T13:51:00.000Z	Jordan_U	beernutz	Yes, it's a bug that has been in their drivers since they first "supported" compiz
2007-10-22T13:51:00.000Z	Jordan_U	beernutz	Their is a work around for it, but it makes things slower
2007-10-22T13:52:00.000Z	beernutz	Jordan_U	 oh, and the 9746 drivers worked just fine with compiz.  do you think would downgrading help?
2007-10-22T13:53:00.000Z	Jordan_U	beernutz	Are all of the windows white?
2007-10-22T13:54:00.000Z	Jordan_U	beernutz	Ahh, that is not the bug I refereed too :)
2007-10-22T13:56:00.000Z	beernutz	Jordan_U	 could you point me towards a better resource for this?  google has a few hits, but maybe i am not using the right keywords (compiz nvidia white screen)
2007-10-22T13:57:00.000Z	Jordan_U	beernutz	Try #compiz
2007-10-22T13:57:00.000Z	Jordan_U	beernutz	Wait, that's not the right channel :)
2007-10-22T13:59:00.000Z	Jordan_U	beernutz	#compiz-fusion
2007-10-22T13:59:00.000Z	Jordan_U	beernutz	np
2008-04-28T04:56:00.000Z	Jordan_U	beernutz	I believe the 32 bit -server kernel can see > 4 GIG RAM, though I don't know about 16G
2008-04-28T05:11:00.000Z	Jordan_U	beernutz	If you currently have windows installed you can install Ubuntu without repartitioning, just insert the Ubuntu CD and it should give you that option
2008-04-28T05:12:00.000Z	beernutz	Jordan_U	no, i will be installing over my existing 32bit ubuntu-server install
2008-04-28T05:13:00.000Z	beernutz	Jordan_U	want to know if i can move my etc home, opt, etc dirs into a hold dir, then install over the top without loosing all my dirs in the hold dir
2008-04-28T05:17:00.000Z	Jordan_U	beernutz	What you want to do is possible with debootsrap but is fairly complicated
