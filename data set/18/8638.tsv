2007-11-28T07:20:00.000Z	genii	Creed	You have 2 NIC in a box?
2007-11-28T07:21:00.000Z	Creed	genii	not yet but I have an extra NIC here.

2007-11-28T07:22:00.000Z	genii	Creed	You don't need to run it all as root either, just sudo su -   or the equivelent sudo switch which I currently forget
2007-11-28T07:22:00.000Z	Creed	genii	thanks :) Can I use IP aliasing instead of two NIC's? The extra NIC I have is 10mbit...kinda sad considering I get 8mbit from comcast with powerboost up to 20mbit.
2007-11-28T07:23:00.000Z	genii	Creed	If you have some intermediate switch both boxes are in I thnk it would work
2007-11-28T07:23:00.000Z	Creed	genii	yeah, its all hooked up to a hp gigabit switch.
2008-01-19T12:08:00.000Z	genii	Creed	A better explanation than whats there or in the manpage http://www.pageresource.com/cgirec/chmod.htm
2008-01-19T12:11:00.000Z	Creed	genii	thought id have to mess with special permissioms but the default takes care of it
2008-01-19T12:11:00.000Z	genii	Creed	It's good to be conservative with permissions and use 777 sparingly
2008-01-19T12:12:00.000Z	Creed	genii	yeah, its a question on a college assignment heh couldnt figure it out since the teachers likes to be an ass and make the questions confusing
2008-01-19T12:12:00.000Z	Creed	genii	ive been a systems admin for a couple years now, rarely do i use 777 :)
2008-01-19T12:15:00.000Z	genii	Creed	It's a trick question then
2008-01-19T12:15:00.000Z	genii	Creed	Because write access to all users is not also execute or read access
2008-01-19T12:15:00.000Z	Creed	genii	yeah but 777 is the only thing that fit well so i went with it, 50/50 so mustve been right heh
2008-01-19T12:16:00.000Z	genii	Creed	Techically the correct answer would be 222
