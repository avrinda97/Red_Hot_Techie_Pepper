2008-01-10T14:33:00.000Z	ObeyRoy		Hey, does anyone know what this JAck Audio Server is?
2008-01-10T14:34:00.000Z	gerro	ObeyRoy	think it does something with headphones its like a different mixer service usually required for wine
2008-01-10T14:42:00.000Z	gerro	ObeyRoy	what programs you working with?
2008-01-10T14:43:00.000Z	gerro	ObeyRoy	just you said you were having crash troubles
2008-01-10T14:43:00.000Z	ObeyRoy	gerro	Yeah, those are the programs that crash
2008-01-10T14:46:00.000Z	gerro	ObeyRoy	kinda asked you what was crashing but you haven't spoken
2008-01-10T14:46:00.000Z	ObeyRoy	gerro	Rosegarden and Kopete keep crashing
2008-01-10T14:47:00.000Z	gerro	ObeyRoy	hmm I use kopete frequently without crashes which preferences were causing trouble? just now heard of Rosegarden but looks like a friend of mine might like it
2008-01-10T14:48:00.000Z	ObeyRoy	gerro	when i was editing my IRC connection
2008-01-10T14:49:00.000Z	gerro	ObeyRoy	oh I've never used irc with it before usually use pidgin for that. I mainly use kopete for the audio/webcam features
2008-01-10T14:50:00.000Z	ObeyRoy	gerro	well, it hasn't crashed yet today. Mostly Rosegarden is the problem now.
2008-01-10T14:57:00.000Z	gerro	ObeyRoy	usually its best even if on windows to download the program then open it
2008-01-10T14:58:00.000Z	gerro	ObeyRoy	sometimes leads to problems otherwise
2008-01-10T14:58:00.000Z	ObeyRoy	gerro	I don't have that option here
2008-01-10T14:58:00.000Z	gerro	ObeyRoy	then choose open with and do custom command and put wine
2008-01-10T15:00:00.000Z	gerro	ObeyRoy	totem however mplayer is awesome if you can manage to set it up properly
2008-01-10T15:00:00.000Z	gerro	ObeyRoy	if you want just audio and something really lite to run in the background some use xmms, its very themeable too
