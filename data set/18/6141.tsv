2008-06-20T17:13:00.000Z	Accidus		I'm looking for kpathsea info page.
2008-06-20T17:13:00.000Z	Accidus		Hmm... I don't think I have synaptic installed.
2008-06-20T17:14:00.000Z	Accidus		adept's on
2008-06-20T17:14:00.000Z	Accidus		What should I search for?
2008-06-20T17:14:00.000Z	Accidus		kpathsea?
2008-06-20T17:15:00.000Z	Accidus		Already done that. It just gives me the libkpathsea package, which is already installed
2008-06-20T17:16:00.000Z	filthpig	Accidus	tried this: http://www.nada.kth.se/cgi-bin/info?(kpathsea)Supported%20file%20formats
2008-06-20T17:08:00.000Z	filthpig	Accidus	have you tried synaptic?
2008-06-20T17:09:00.000Z	filthpig	Accidus	no, you can get loads of docs for programs via synaptic, it's under system - administration
2008-06-20T17:11:00.000Z	Accidus	filthpig	Erm, I'm a bit new to Ubuntu, I'm using Kubuntu. What did you mean by 'system - administartion'?
2008-06-20T17:12:00.000Z	filthpig	Accidus	oh, I thought you were using the GNOME version of ubuntu. Er, I'm not sure about kubuntu, havent used it for years
2008-06-20T17:13:00.000Z	filthpig	Accidus	pop up a terminal (Konsole) and type "kdesu synaptic"
2008-06-20T17:14:00.000Z	filthpig	Accidus	try kdesu adept, then
2008-06-20T17:14:00.000Z	filthpig	Accidus	yeah, or kpathsea info
2008-06-20T17:16:00.000Z	filthpig	Accidus	there is a possibility that the file does not exist. I dunno about that, though.
2008-06-20T17:23:00.000Z	filthpig	Accidus	oh, that's obvious ;p
2008-06-20T17:24:00.000Z	filthpig	Accidus	ask and we'll see
2008-06-20T17:26:00.000Z	filthpig	Accidus	hm, you might wanna try the #kubuntu channel, but I guess there's just a setting that's been changed. I guess you can try alsamixer and see if you find anything there.
