2005-07-13T12:29:00.000Z	rabies	husher	if you are really wanting to use it, install it in a chroot sandbox
2005-07-13T12:29:00.000Z	rabies	husher	theres docs on how to do it on the web
2005-07-13T12:29:00.000Z	husher	rabies	that's a good idea
2005-07-13T12:29:00.000Z	husher	rabies	thanks

2005-07-13T12:39:00.000Z	rabies	husher	i used mine for 3 years, no issues
2005-07-13T12:40:00.000Z	rabies	husher	and all the drivers are GPLed from the company
2005-07-13T12:40:00.000Z	husher	rabies	guess I'm just unlucky :(
2005-07-13T12:40:00.000Z	rabies	husher	probably
2005-07-13T12:40:00.000Z	husher	rabies	i do like the GPL'd drivers, though
2005-07-13T12:40:00.000Z	rabies	husher	ya, the fact that you dont have to do a chroot install is nice :)
