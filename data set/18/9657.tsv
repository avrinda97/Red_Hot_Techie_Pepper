2008-11-14T09:17:00.000Z	mintsoup		firefox 3 does not save any browse history--the back buttons, forward, and refresh buttons are greyed out at all times..
2008-11-14T09:19:00.000Z	mintsoup		how can i fix firefox?  The back button/forward button don't work
2008-11-14T09:19:00.000Z	Dulak	mintsoup	go to help:config in the address bar and search for history and see if anything is set to 0 or false
2008-11-14T09:20:00.000Z	mintsoup	Dulak	it says the protocol (help) isn't associated
2008-11-14T09:20:00.000Z	Dulak	mintsoup	help:config not help://config
2008-11-14T09:20:00.000Z	Dulak	mintsoup	my bad, about:config
2008-11-14T09:20:00.000Z	Dulak	mintsoup	I'm tired, it's about:config
2008-11-14T09:21:00.000Z	mintsoup	Dulak	browser.history.showSessions is set false, that's the only one with history in the name
2008-11-14T09:22:00.000Z	Dulak	mintsoup	mine is set to false too so that's not the problem
2008-11-14T09:23:00.000Z	Dulak	mintsoup	close firefox and go to your home dir and move the .mozilla directory to another name then reopen firefox and it should create a new default config
2008-11-14T09:24:00.000Z	Dulak	mintsoup	when I search for history I get about 10 things in the list with various settings so a default config might fix you up
2008-11-14T09:24:00.000Z	mintsoup	Dulak	i did that already in response to the 'firefox is already running' error... and since that might have caused the problem i have now i tried moving my old profile back to the default name
2008-11-14T09:25:00.000Z	Dulak	mintsoup	don't move the profile itself to the new profile, just move the stuff you need like bookmarks etc
2008-11-14T09:25:00.000Z	mintsoup	Dulak	firefox should create a new profile when it starts up and doesn't find the mozilla dir i think
2008-11-14T09:26:00.000Z	Dulak	mintsoup	yes, but you don't want to just rename your old profile, you would go into the old profile and copy say your bookmarks.html file from the old profile to the new profile dir
2008-11-14T09:27:00.000Z	mintsoup	Dulak	i'm not concerned with any settings from my old profile because this is a rather fresh install and i didn't add bookmarks or anything yet.  The point is that I created a new profile and it didn't resolve the issue
2008-11-14T09:29:00.000Z	Dulak	mintsoup	reinstall firefox then, not sure what's up, afaik any config issues like you describe should be solved with a new profile
2008-11-14T09:30:00.000Z	mintsoup	Dulak	; k.. i really doubt it's actually a configuration issue.. just an incredibly annoying bug .  I might try grabbing source from moz's website instead of taking ubuntu's package as it seems unstable for my setup..
