2010-10-23T00:13:00.000Z	lock	thenoob	you want to transmit 8 miles omnidirectionally?
2010-10-23T00:13:00.000Z	thenoob	lock	yeah

2010-10-23T00:15:00.000Z	lock	thenoob	for starters, if I were you, I would do some reasearch on long range wifi, then determine which of the methods might be more advantageous to your requirements
