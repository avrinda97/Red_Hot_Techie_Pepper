2005-08-04T07:33:00.000Z	_SD_Keo	hybrid_goth	I have no switch, there's a crossover cable running to the XBOX, and the PC is hogging the ethernet port that I need..
2005-08-04T07:34:00.000Z	hybrid_goth	_SD_Keo	without a wireless network the usb wireless wont work
2005-08-04T07:35:00.000Z	_SD_Keo	hybrid_goth	I said nothing about wireless, the modem sits next to the PC and I would like it hooked up through USB directly
