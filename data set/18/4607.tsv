2009-11-13T02:36:00.000Z	mneptok	ZenMasta	sounds like you need to repair the filesystems
2009-11-13T02:37:00.000Z	ZenMasta	mneptok	I plan to wipe HD1 with the backup that is on HD2
2009-11-13T02:38:00.000Z	mneptok	ZenMasta	but the partitions you are trying to mount at boot time complain of bad sectors. this is usually a sign of filesystem corruption or disk failure.
2009-11-13T02:39:00.000Z	ZenMasta	mneptok	HD1 is a bad install of windows   HD2 has a backup of HD1 before it went bad. HD1 will not let me boot into ubuntu because of the problems I described but I can plug it in once ubuntu is loaded. I cannot however plugin HD2 and have it autodetect
2009-11-13T02:39:00.000Z	mneptok	ZenMasta	how is the drive connected? SATA? IDE?
2009-11-13T02:39:00.000Z	ZenMasta	mneptok	actually more than a backup, it's another boxes win install plus the backup
2009-11-13T02:40:00.000Z	mneptok	ZenMasta	so boot without the drive plugged in, then plug it in and look for the new devices in /dev/sd* (ls /dev/sd* | plug in drive | ls /dev/sd*). then manually mount the partition(s) you need.
2009-11-13T02:47:00.000Z	ZenMasta	mneptok	I'm not really experienced with that sort of thing. I'm looking in Gparted right now and it sees the 2nd hd just fine
