2006-07-28T08:16:00.000Z	klees		can i rip cd's in MP3 VBR format with grip?
2006-07-28T08:17:00.000Z	ardchoille	klees	You can use grip to rip a music CD to mp3 files, but you need to install lame. I'm not sure what VBR means
2006-07-29T12:09:00.000Z	ardchoille	klees	There is Workspace Switcher applet for the gnome panel
2006-07-29T12:09:00.000Z	klees	ardchoille	yeah but i was wondering if there was an independent applet that sits in the desktop
2006-07-29T12:10:00.000Z	ardchoille	klees	Not that I know of unless you use a dockapp in a window manager that has a dock
2006-07-29T12:11:00.000Z	ardchoille	klees	Yes :)
2006-07-29T12:11:00.000Z	ardchoille	klees	You first need to be using a Window Manager that has a dock
2006-07-29T12:12:00.000Z	ardchoille	klees	Metacity is the default window manager in gnome, but you can replace it with another wm
2006-07-29T12:14:00.000Z	ardchoille	klees	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Replace_Metacity_with_Openbox_in_gnome  if you want to use the openbox window manager
2006-07-29T12:14:00.000Z	ardchoille	klees	You can use a lot of the info in that guide for other wm's
2006-07-29T12:15:00.000Z	klees	ardchoille	sounds good.  thx!
2006-08-05T09:10:00.000Z	ardchoille	klees	You'll have to find the proper vga setting for that res
2006-08-05T09:11:00.000Z	klees	ardchoille	how can i do that?
2006-08-05T09:11:00.000Z	ardchoille	klees	I don't have a list, but I have seen several. possibly google "vga=791" or something
2006-08-05T09:16:00.000Z	ardchoille	klees	Maybe this will be of some help: http://wiki.antlinux.com/pmwiki.php?n=HowTos.VgaModes
