2009-08-23T23:34:00.000Z	Bavaria		pam_unix(gdm:session): session opened for user dave by (uid=0)
2009-08-23T23:34:00.000Z	Bavaria		can this have any other cause than some person logging in via gdm?
2009-08-23T23:34:00.000Z	Bavaria		maybe cron or something?
2009-08-23T23:35:00.000Z	Bavaria		my password should be unbreakable
2009-08-23T23:35:00.000Z	Bavaria		I wasn't there the day when this messages was logged
2009-08-23T23:35:00.000Z	Bavaria		So it's impossible someone logged in
2009-08-23T23:35:00.000Z	Bavaria		But then there's this message
2009-08-23T23:35:00.000Z	Bavaria		Can that have any other cause
2009-08-23T23:36:00.000Z	adalal	Bavaria	do u have any cron jobs? :S
2009-08-23T23:37:00.000Z	Bavaria	adalal	only the standard cronjobs and the ones of the programs installed
2009-08-23T23:37:00.000Z	Bavaria	adalal	but is sais this message originated from gdm
2009-08-23T23:38:00.000Z	Bavaria	adalal	not really, but I doubt he'd have the skills to change shadow and so on
2009-08-23T23:39:00.000Z	adalal	Bavaria	but a boot cd wouldn't leave a message like that :S
2009-08-23T23:40:00.000Z	Bavaria	adalal	the issue puzzles me
2009-08-23T23:40:00.000Z	Bavaria	adalal	would you mind taking a look at my auth.log?
2009-08-23T23:40:00.000Z	adalal	Bavaria	pm me
