2010-01-03T10:40:00.000Z	faileas	prime_heretic	if its for personal or limited use,  checkinstall is great ;p
2010-01-03T10:41:00.000Z	prime_heretic	faileas	it's just the checkinstall page it shouldn;t be used for distribution "CheckInstall is not designed to produce packages suitable for distribution."
2010-01-03T10:42:00.000Z	prime_heretic	faileas	I'm building it specifically to distribute
2010-01-03T10:42:00.000Z	prime_heretic	faileas	I wouldnt bother with all this trouble otherwise, as I say an install is literally copying 4 files to the right directory
2010-01-03T10:43:00.000Z	faileas	prime_heretic	./configure ; make ; checkinstall. take the deb and shove it to your user
2010-01-03T10:43:00.000Z	faileas	prime_heretic	i DID say for limited or personal use- i don't think it does dependancy tracking like a real deb
2010-01-03T10:44:00.000Z	prime_heretic	faileas	Well I dunno I'm a bit lost with all this packaging stuff, I'm just a lowly programmer
2010-01-03T10:49:00.000Z	prime_heretic	faileas	Ah I see what checkinstall does, pretty clever
2010-01-03T10:49:00.000Z	faileas	prime_heretic	it is
2010-01-03T10:50:00.000Z	prime_heretic	faileas	This oplugin's python tho, doesn;t follow the normal make process, nearest I get is compressing the python source up and copying across
2010-01-03T10:52:00.000Z	prime_heretic	faileas	maybe it's possible just to do a makefile that copies stuff across, I'll look into thet and see if checkinstall can then be used
2010-01-03T10:52:00.000Z	faileas	prime_heretic	wait. what langage is this in?
2010-01-03T10:52:00.000Z	prime_heretic	faileas	python
2010-01-03T10:52:00.000Z	prime_heretic	faileas	it's a totem plugin
2010-01-03T10:53:00.000Z	faileas	prime_heretic	just use a bash script or something then ;p
2010-01-03T10:53:00.000Z	prime_heretic	faileas	S'pose I could, I want to do it properly though, well at least get a .deb out of it
2010-01-03T10:58:00.000Z	faileas	prime_heretic	that looks like the 'proper' way ;p
2010-01-03T11:00:00.000Z	prime_heretic	faileas	Aye yeah, seems a better solution than trying to subvert make
