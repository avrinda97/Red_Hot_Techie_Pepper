2011-01-12T01:38:00.000Z	DEAD_BEEF		If I recursively copied a directory without using -p to preserve permissions, what are the chances of recovering the original permissions?
2011-01-12T01:39:00.000Z	smw	DEAD_BEEF	do you have the original? 100%. Not? 0%
2011-01-12T01:39:00.000Z	DEAD_BEEF	smw	that's what I was afraid of
2011-01-12T01:39:00.000Z	DEAD_BEEF	smw	luckily I'm not a sysadmin
2011-01-12T01:41:00.000Z	DEAD_BEEF	smw	is cp -R predictable in what permissions is changes/discards?
2011-01-12T01:41:00.000Z	smw	DEAD_BEEF	it makes everything the same permissions.
2011-01-12T01:41:00.000Z	smw	DEAD_BEEF	there is no data you can get from the permissions.
2011-01-12T01:42:00.000Z	smw	DEAD_BEEF	what happened?
2011-01-12T01:43:00.000Z	DEAD_BEEF		I added a 1TB drive and cp -Red my /home/user folder to the mounted drive then dropped to a root shell ...
2011-01-12T01:43:00.000Z	DEAD_BEEF	smw	... then edited fstab, you get the idea
2011-01-12T01:44:00.000Z	smw	DEAD_BEEF	makes sense. You can just chown your home directory to you
2011-01-12T01:44:00.000Z	DEAD_BEEF	smw	well, I still have ownership, but not complete write perms
2011-01-12T01:44:00.000Z	smw	DEAD_BEEF	then go through and change permissions as needed. For example, give 0 permissions to others for your home dir (not recursive).
2011-01-12T01:45:00.000Z	smw	DEAD_BEEF	that does not make sense
2011-01-12T01:45:00.000Z	smw	DEAD_BEEF	ls -l your home dir
2011-01-12T01:45:00.000Z	DEAD_BEEF	smw	I'll have to check when I get back home
2011-01-12T01:46:00.000Z	smw	DEAD_BEEF	ok
2011-01-12T01:46:00.000Z	DEAD_BEEF	smw	thanks
