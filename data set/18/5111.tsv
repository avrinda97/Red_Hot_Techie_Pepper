2008-12-10T15:04:00.000Z	nikin		i am running an eeepc 900 with ubuntu, and i want to play some gmes in wine.. mainly GT3 and GTA VC .. i managed to install Vice City just fine. But the fps is to low. Wht i am thinking of is either set the detaillevel of the game somehow even lower than it ispossible in the GUI, or get some extra performnce out of the GMA950.
2008-12-10T15:05:00.000Z	TiNRiB	nikin	dont bother.
2008-12-10T15:05:00.000Z	nikin	TiNRiB	why?
2008-12-10T15:05:00.000Z	TiNRiB		i have tried to tweak wine for optimal performance for loads of games.
2008-12-10T15:06:00.000Z	TiNRiB		the FPS just isn't up to scratch
2008-12-10T15:06:00.000Z	TiNRiB		even by going to the latest releases of wine.
2008-12-10T15:06:00.000Z	nikin	TiNRiB	ok then no wine  tuning.. wht about tuning the game, or tuning the videocard driver?
2008-12-10T15:07:00.000Z	TiNRiB		not looked at that...
2008-12-10T15:07:00.000Z	TiNRiB		have you tried at all?
2008-12-10T15:08:00.000Z	TiNRiB	nikin	i had a GTS8800 640MB playing COD4, halflife 2 under wine 1.0
2008-12-10T15:08:00.000Z	TiNRiB		performance was pretty bad with fps around 20
2008-12-10T15:09:00.000Z	nikin	TiNRiB	i tryed to find some config file in the game.. no luck on that.. for the videocard i have no idea. the only thing that coes in mind i somehow disable features so that the game does not try touse them, like particles
2008-12-10T15:09:00.000Z	TiNRiB	nikin	turning all the effects down does improve it... but then the game looks shabby.
2008-12-10T15:09:00.000Z	nikin	TiNRiB	i had GTA_VC run finron a Geforce8400M :D
2008-12-10T15:09:00.000Z	TiNRiB		FPS?
2008-12-10T15:10:00.000Z	nikin	TiNRiB	i dont care... :D i like the missions and the driving :D no need for bullet particles :D
2008-12-10T15:11:00.000Z	TiNRiB		haha yeh sure.. first person shooters.. I meant frames per sec.
2008-12-10T15:12:00.000Z	nikin	TiNRiB	i am the one whotweaked UT to thepoint where there where no textures at all :D
