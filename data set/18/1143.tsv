2011-05-18T13:42:00.000Z	uabn93	pepeleches	at what speed did you burn the disk?

2011-05-18T13:44:00.000Z	pepeleches	uabn93	from ubuntu.com main download page (html), and ubuntu.com alternate downloads page (torrent)
2011-05-18T13:45:00.000Z	uabn93	pepeleches	did you do an md5 checksum just in case?
2011-05-18T13:46:00.000Z	uabn93	pepeleches	If you downloaded from torrent, you don't have to worry about this.
2011-05-18T13:46:00.000Z	uabn93	pepeleches	but i've had errors before when downloading from the ubuntu site
2011-05-18T13:48:00.000Z	uabn93	pepeleches	does it at least get to the menu so you can do a disk check?
2011-05-18T13:49:00.000Z	pepeleches	uabn93	nope, it gets stuck before a menu apears
2011-05-18T13:50:00.000Z	uabn93	pepeleches	hmm, i cant help you w/ reading what's on the pictures you posted. I wonder if its your disk drive.
2011-05-18T13:51:00.000Z	pepeleches	uabn93	ok, thanks anyway... I will try to instal 10.11, and then upgrade to 11.04
2011-05-18T13:51:00.000Z	uabn93	pepeleches	hey, have you tried usb?
2011-05-18T13:52:00.000Z	pepeleches	uabn93	 not yet
2011-05-18T13:52:00.000Z	pepeleches	uabn93	goin' to try :)
2011-05-18T13:52:00.000Z	uabn93	pepeleches	that method must work. Plus, its less of a hassle than upgrading from 10.10
