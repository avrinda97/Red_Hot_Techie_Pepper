2007-02-26T16:25:00.000Z	slacker_nl		does anyone know a good howto/tutorial for encrypting a livecd (bootable linux cd)?
2007-02-26T16:26:00.000Z	mneptok	slacker_nl	you can't encrypt the entire CD
2007-02-26T16:26:00.000Z	slacker_nl	mneptok	no, but I should be able to encrypt /etc, or other mount points
2007-02-26T16:27:00.000Z	mneptok	slacker_nl	you can encrypt anything that is not required to get devmapper up and functional
2007-02-26T16:32:00.000Z	slacker_nl	mneptok	come again: you can encrypt anything that is not required to get devmapper up and functional << don't fully understand you
2007-02-26T16:34:00.000Z	mneptok	slacker_nl	dm-crypt is the correct way to encrypt filesystems. dm-crypt relies upon devmapper. so you can't have the stuff that enables devmapper on an encryted partition as it starts a chicken/egg problem.
2007-02-26T16:34:00.000Z	slacker_nl	mneptok	no, OK, I need a small ection unencrypted, that I know
2007-02-26T16:35:00.000Z	slacker_nl	mneptok	that's why I want a document on what to do - most of the docs I found are related to securing data on a PC, not on a CD
2007-02-26T16:36:00.000Z	mneptok	slacker_nl	sorry, never cared about encrypting a CD. i don't see the point.
2007-02-26T16:36:00.000Z	slacker_nl	mneptok	livecd with sensitive data (like vpnc.conf and wpa_supplicant.conf) - and because you don't see a reason, well, I do :)
2007-02-26T16:37:00.000Z	mneptok	slacker_nl	wpa_supplicant has sensitive data?
2007-02-26T16:37:00.000Z	slacker_nl	mneptok	my wireless network passwords
2007-02-26T16:37:00.000Z	mneptok	slacker_nl	in an already encrypted hash
2007-02-26T16:38:00.000Z	slacker_nl	mneptok	they are hashed, but I just want my data encrypted on the CD
2007-02-26T16:38:00.000Z	mneptok	slacker_nl	why not just use a USB key as /home?
2007-02-26T16:38:00.000Z	slacker_nl	mneptok	because I want it on a livecd
2007-02-26T16:39:00.000Z	mneptok	slacker_nl	k, good luck :)
2007-02-26T16:39:00.000Z	slacker_nl	mneptok	thanks :)
