2009-04-27T06:44:00.000Z	eseven73		No one has the Rocketfish(Best Buy/Broadcom) bluetooth dongle working in Ubuntu? I find that hard to believe
2009-04-27T06:45:00.000Z	AK_Dave	eseven73	Is this your problem: https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+question/33851
2009-04-27T06:46:00.000Z	eseven73	AK_Dave	kind of I guess
2009-04-27T06:48:00.000Z	AK_Dave	eseven73	Then the reason it doesn't work is obvious. The dongle doesn't have any nonvolatile memory because it was built so cheap, so you have to load its firmware to it every time you apply power or plug it in.
2009-04-27T06:48:00.000Z	eseven73	AK_Dave	so why it work in vista?
2009-04-27T06:48:00.000Z	AK_Dave	eseven73	You have the bluetooth equilant of a "windows modem" or a "soft modem" in old parlayance.
2009-04-27T06:48:00.000Z	AK_Dave	eseven73	Why work in Vista? Because you installed a little app in Vista that loads the firmware to it so it can work.
2009-04-27T06:49:00.000Z	eseven73	AK_Dave	yeah that makes sense but, I would think Ubuntu would have a driver by now
2009-04-27T06:49:00.000Z	AK_Dave	eseven73	its not a driver problem.
2009-04-27T06:49:00.000Z	AK_Dave	eseven73	its a firmware problem
2009-04-27T06:50:00.000Z	AK_Dave	eseven73	Its a "you bought cheap hardware" problem.
2009-04-27T06:50:00.000Z	AK_Dave	eseven73	They ripped you off.
2009-04-27T06:50:00.000Z	AK_Dave	eseven73	return it.
2009-04-27T06:51:00.000Z	AK_Dave	eseven73	There is a slim chance that this might work. Slim.
2009-04-27T06:52:00.000Z	AK_Dave	eseven73	Here's my insane idea: install Sun Virtualbox, the PUEL from virtualbox.org, with USB support, and install Vista in a virtual guest. Allow USB access. Install the dongle software in the virtual guest. Plug in dongle. Load firmware.
2009-04-27T06:54:00.000Z	eseven73	AK_Dave	that's a good idea actually, but I really don't like having to use Virtualbox just for one thing, but I suppose there's not much choice, thanks for the info.
2009-04-27T06:55:00.000Z	AK_Dave	eseven73	It would be a LOT of work to make the dongle work. But presumably, once you get the firmware into it then bluez should use it.
