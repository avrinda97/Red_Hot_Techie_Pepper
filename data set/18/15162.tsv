2006-02-27T11:37:00.000Z	kurt		hello all.  I'm having some trouble seting a route.  I keep getting an error stating that the "Network is unreachable".  Any takers?
2006-02-27T11:37:00.000Z	wastrel	kurt	 is your network card plugged in?  :] 
2006-02-27T11:38:00.000Z	kurt	wastrel	it is.  route is for a network segment that is not on the local network segment.  I'm trying to set the gateway to use.
2006-02-27T11:38:00.000Z	wastrel	kurt	 default gw?
2006-02-27T11:41:00.000Z	kurt	wastrel	see my last msg?
2006-02-27T11:42:00.000Z	wastrel	kurt	   route add -net 10.0.1.0/24 gw 172.16.100.2  maybe?
2006-02-27T11:42:00.000Z	kurt	wastrel	that is the command i used.  generated message that the network is unreachable.
2006-02-27T11:43:00.000Z	wastrel	kurt	 that was the output of the route command?
2006-02-27T11:47:00.000Z	wastrel	kurt	 of course you can ping 172.16.100.2 ?
2006-02-27T11:47:00.000Z	kurt	wastrel	no problems pinging at all
2006-02-27T11:52:00.000Z	wastrel	kurt	 do you have to go thru the default gw to reach  172.16.100.2 ?
2006-02-27T11:52:00.000Z	kurt	wastrel	no I don't
2006-02-27T11:57:00.000Z	wastrel	kurt	 so the NIC on your LAN is 172.16.100.2 ?
2006-02-27T11:58:00.000Z	kurt	wastrel	yes
2006-02-27T11:58:00.000Z	wastrel	kurt	 so your gateway is 172.16.100.3 isn't it?
2006-02-27T12:01:00.000Z	kurt	wastrel	default gateway?  that is set to the internet router.  172.16.100.0/24 has a gateway to the internet via 172.16.100.1.  I am trying to set a route to my remote network of 10.0.1.0/24
2006-02-27T12:02:00.000Z	wastrel	kurt	 no the gateway for the 10.* network.   route add -net 10.foo gw 172.x.y.3   <  .3 not .2  (?)  you said you'd used .2 before
2006-02-27T12:17:00.000Z	wastrel	kurt	 breezy-ca left...  looks ok to me
