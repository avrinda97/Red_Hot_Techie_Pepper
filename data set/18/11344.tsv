2006-08-13T14:01:00.000Z	bruenig	Lattyware	but did it work?
2006-08-13T14:02:00.000Z	Lattyware	bruenig	nothing.
2007-07-23T14:58:00.000Z	bruenig	Lattyware	deluge...
2007-07-23T14:58:00.000Z	Lattyware	bruenig	Last time I tried deluge it was really incomplete, and lacked features and gave me far slower speeds.
2007-07-23T14:59:00.000Z	bruenig	Lattyware	lacked what?
2007-07-23T14:59:00.000Z	bruenig	Lattyware	you realize also that clients have nothing really to do with speeds right?
2007-07-23T15:00:00.000Z	Lattyware	bruenig	Rubbish. Better support for encryption, and DHT have massive effects, finding more peers and bypassing blocking.
2007-07-23T15:02:00.000Z	bruenig	Lattyware	dht has an effect but that is it, clients other than that have nothing to do with speed. They have default settings but if you set the peer numbers and connection numbers and all of that the same on every client, you will get the same speeds, the myth about clients affecting speed comes from those who don't realize you are suppose to configure it to fit your settings
2007-07-23T15:02:00.000Z	bruenig	Lattyware	deluge has dht by the way
2007-07-23T15:03:00.000Z	Lattyware	bruenig	Encryption. My ISP blocks BT traffic, so I have to use encryption, that makes a big difference, does Deluge support that?
2007-07-23T15:04:00.000Z	bruenig	Lattyware	yes
2007-07-23T15:04:00.000Z	bruenig	Lattyware	you must have used it when it was really young
2007-07-23T15:04:00.000Z	bruenig	Lattyware	it has blocklists, dht, encryption, all that jazz
2007-07-23T15:04:00.000Z	Lattyware	bruenig	Yes, maybe.
2007-07-23T15:04:00.000Z	Lattyware	bruenig	I'll check it out again.
