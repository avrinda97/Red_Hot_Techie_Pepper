2005-12-04T13:23:00.000Z	bluefox83	dell500	then you're using xfree86
2005-12-04T13:24:00.000Z	dell500	bluefox83	 didn't work either
2005-12-04T13:28:00.000Z	bluefox83	dell500	you'll need to look on a lot of forums to find the info for that
2005-12-04T13:29:00.000Z	dell500	bluefox83	 well it was working, but for some reason i updated the kernal and now i'm getting all these wacky lines everywhere
2005-12-04T13:29:00.000Z	bluefox83	dell500	remember how you got it working last time?
2005-12-04T13:29:00.000Z	dell500	bluefox83	 yup, i have the config file
2005-12-04T13:30:00.000Z	dell500	bluefox83	 problem is that with that conf file it makes these crappy lines everywhere
2005-12-04T13:30:00.000Z	bluefox83	dell500	i assume you had to compile video drivers, am i correct?
2005-12-04T13:30:00.000Z	dell500	bluefox83	 ah ha!
2005-12-04T13:30:00.000Z	dell500	bluefox83	 yes indeed, the new ati ones i think
2005-12-04T13:30:00.000Z	bluefox83	dell500	compile drivers, use modprobe to load it
2005-12-04T13:31:00.000Z	dell500	bluefox83	 recompile, then modprobe?
2005-12-04T13:32:00.000Z	bluefox83	dell500	modprobe loads the driver into the kernel without rebooting
2005-12-04T13:32:00.000Z	dell500	bluefox83	 modprobe fglrx?
2005-12-04T13:33:00.000Z	bluefox83	dell500	yeah i guess so...if it works it will either spit out the details of the driver or say absolutely nothing at all
2005-12-04T13:38:00.000Z	bluefox83	dell500	when you modprobe, it wont work if you don't have a config file loaded that works with that..lol
2005-12-04T13:38:00.000Z	dell500	bluefox83	 ok, well i gotta go eat, i'm starvin' marvin', so i'll bbl, hopefully you'll be here to help :)
2005-12-04T15:07:00.000Z	dell500	bluefox83	 you still around?? :)
