2012-11-06T15:53:00.000Z	Noriandir		hi. I'm having some problems with crontab. it does not execute one script sometimes... =/
2012-11-06T15:53:00.000Z	iceroot	Noriandir	we need more details
2012-11-06T15:54:00.000Z	iceroot	Noriandir	the exact cronjob and maybe usefull infos from /var/log/syslog
2012-11-06T15:57:00.000Z	Noriandir	iceroot	script: http://pastie.org/5194653          syslog: http://pastie.org/5194666           crontab: http://pastie.org/5194669
2012-11-06T16:00:00.000Z	iceroot	Noriandir	40  23  *   *   mon-fri  /home/ciccio/Scripts/Simulazione/Simulate_NEW >> /home/ciccio/MESSAGE/Summary.log
2012-11-06T16:00:00.000Z	iceroot	Noriandir	there you are missing bash  if the script is not executable the script will not start
2012-11-06T16:02:00.000Z	Noriandir		i know, but that is not relevent. the script begins with a #!/bin/bash and if you see the time, the one that in syslog wasn't exectuted was the one at 10:50 AM an that had the bash before
2012-11-06T16:02:00.000Z	iceroot	Noriandir	the script will only executed if it has chmod +x  the shebang is not important for that, but that is just an info, seems its executable in your case
2012-11-06T16:03:00.000Z	iceroot	Noriandir	and i dont see a script which sould start on 10:50
2012-11-06T16:03:00.000Z	Noriandir	iceroot	yes, it is. It has 755 permissions
2012-11-06T16:04:00.000Z	iceroot	Noriandir	22:40, 23:10, 23:40 and 11:51
2012-11-06T16:04:00.000Z	iceroot	Noriandir	no 10:50
2012-11-06T16:04:00.000Z	Noriandir	iceroot	yea, you're right. i misstyped there. the last one is me testing for see if it is working
2012-11-06T16:05:00.000Z	Noriandir	iceroot	always changing to a few minute after editing it
2012-11-06T16:06:00.000Z	iceroot	Noriandir	* * * * * foobar :)
2012-11-06T16:07:00.000Z	Noriandir	iceroot	yea, i probably should have done that. or making it execute every 2 minutes or so
2012-11-06T16:07:00.000Z	iceroot	Noriandir	yeah
2012-11-06T16:09:00.000Z	Noriandir	iceroot	changed it to 00-59/5. lets see if it works. because it worked the last time i changed the date... not sure if it will work allways tho =/
