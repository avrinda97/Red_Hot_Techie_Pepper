2005-07-21T16:09:00.000Z	marsh		hey.
2005-07-21T16:09:00.000Z	marsh		I'm a bit pissed...
2005-07-21T16:10:00.000Z	marsh		and tell me if I'm being an arrogant bastard but...
2005-07-21T16:10:00.000Z	anto9us	marsh	many people will read that as being annoyed
2005-07-21T16:11:00.000Z	marsh	anto9us	yeah, true anto, true...
2005-07-21T16:12:00.000Z	anto9us	marsh	freedom of ideas, knowledge and technological tools, a level playing field irrespective of wealth
2005-07-21T16:16:00.000Z	anto9us	marsh	I think true freedom lies in running software that has no nasty little spy stuff in there
2005-07-21T16:19:00.000Z	anto9us	marsh	subject to a code of conduct, everyone is welcome to get involved
2005-07-21T16:21:00.000Z	anto9us	marsh	you mean in nautilus?
2005-07-21T16:25:00.000Z	anto9us	marsh	hmm.. I think the idea of many of the developers of guis is to protect the user from those things
2005-07-21T16:26:00.000Z	anto9us	marsh	protect their brains from exploding :)
2005-07-21T16:29:00.000Z	anto9us	marsh	I don't think computers should be restricted to only the literate or tech savvy, I disagree with you
2005-07-21T16:33:00.000Z	anto9us	marsh	depends how tired I am, sometimes I have jamais vu and can't even remember my own name, never mind the paramaters for a samba mount
2005-07-21T16:35:00.000Z	anto9us	marsh	yeah, things will level out though, time will take care of that :)
2005-07-21T16:37:00.000Z	anto9us	marsh	I don't find most coders like that, maybe you've just been unlucky
2005-07-21T16:48:00.000Z	anto9us	marsh	the goal of ubuntu is to be for human beings and there's a lot of bounties for good guis for that kind of stuff, it's going to get easier
2005-07-21T16:56:00.000Z	marsh	anto9us	yeah - thinks what I'm saying is that my money is on the one that does the adviertising of the config files (or areas of them via links), more advertising of keyboard shortcut settings (next to all options in the gui menu's - along with a shortcutto the line in the config file to change it - possibly with a small help/list-of-options for entries note when the mouse hovers), and shortcuts to the 'change keys' bits of t
2005-07-21T16:58:00.000Z	anto9us	marsh	yeah, I think it will take time, it's like building a bridge from 2 sides of the river and getting them to meet in the middle
