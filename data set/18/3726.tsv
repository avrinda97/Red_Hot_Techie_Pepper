2009-08-10T11:09:00.000Z	edbian	Guest1327	Usually if you wait like 20 - 30 minutes and rephrase the whole question someone new will show up and be able to answer
2009-08-10T11:10:00.000Z	edbian	Guest1327	For what it's worth.  I am VERY confident that you will be able to find the config file for the screensavers.  It's just a matter of finding the correct file.  It's probably somewhere in /etc/X11
2009-08-10T11:11:00.000Z	edbian	Guest1327	That was ment for somebody else.  Sorry if I confused you.

2009-08-10T11:17:00.000Z	edbian	Guest1327	It's not an issue with the distro.  It's with the kernel.  And Lexmark in my case.  They have 0 support for linux.
