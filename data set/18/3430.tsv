2010-10-22T13:36:00.000Z	industrial		How do I remove the email icon from the indicator applet in the gnome panel? I dont care about email since I use gmail as a webapp.
2010-10-22T13:37:00.000Z	industrial		annoys me
2010-10-22T13:38:00.000Z	iego	industrial	right click it and select Remove
2010-10-22T13:39:00.000Z	industrial	iego	that removes the APPLET
2010-10-22T13:39:00.000Z	industrial	iego	the applet consists of more then one icon
2010-10-22T13:39:00.000Z	industrial		I want to keep the volume slider but ubuntu removed the old separate one in 10.10
2010-10-22T13:39:00.000Z	industrial		now its one thing with email and volume and keyring etc

2010-10-22T13:42:00.000Z	industrial		they should cut them up into one icon things so I can ditch the ones I dont like >:(
2010-10-22T13:42:00.000Z	industrial		and since when is an icon inside the tray not good enough
2010-10-22T13:42:00.000Z	industrial		dont need an applet for it
2010-10-22T13:42:00.000Z	industrial		(guess thats an applet too)
2010-10-22T13:43:00.000Z	industrial		you can see my network has a tray icon, can I get one for volume aswell?
2010-10-22T13:43:00.000Z	industrial		then I'm dont=e, basically
2010-10-22T13:43:00.000Z	industrial		s/t=//
2010-10-22T13:43:00.000Z	iego	industrial	right click the panel, and click Add to panel
2010-10-22T13:46:00.000Z	industrial	iego	like i said ubuntu removed the one that was there for just volume with ubuntu 10.10
2010-10-22T13:46:00.000Z	industrial	iego	at least I have no volume app there.
