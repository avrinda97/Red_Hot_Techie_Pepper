2007-10-31T18:34:00.000Z	noel		Greetings folks. Is there a vocoder in ubuntu studio?
2007-10-31T18:35:00.000Z	gordonjcp	noel	not as such, but there is a ladspa vocoder
2007-10-31T18:35:00.000Z	gordonjcp	noel	there's also a patch to fix the lack of stereo output
2007-10-31T18:36:00.000Z	gordonjcp	noel	compile from source
2007-10-31T18:37:00.000Z	gordonjcp	noel	it works fairly well, definitely worth the effort
2007-10-31T18:39:00.000Z	gordonjcp	noel	that's a bit odd
2007-10-31T18:40:00.000Z	gordonjcp	noel	stupid question but a) you've untarred the source tarball, and b) you're in the right directory?
2007-10-31T18:41:00.000Z	gordonjcp	noel	can you see the file "configure"?
2007-10-31T18:41:00.000Z	gordonjcp	noel	check you downloaded the right thing
2007-10-31T18:42:00.000Z	gordonjcp	noel	what *exactly* did you download?
2007-10-31T18:43:00.000Z	gordonjcp	noel	I have done this and got it working, and well
2007-10-31T18:43:00.000Z	gordonjcp	noel	but I'm at work right now and really really really busy
2007-10-31T18:44:00.000Z	gordonjcp	noel	maybe try in #lad
2007-10-31T18:44:00.000Z	gordonjcp	noel	can you wait about two hours?
2007-10-31T18:44:00.000Z	gordonjcp	noel	or better yet -> http://linuxrockstar.blogspot.com/2006/07/effect-ladspa-vocoder-howto.html
2007-10-31T18:45:00.000Z	gordonjcp	noel	follow the directions on that page *exactly*
2007-10-31T18:45:00.000Z	gordonjcp	noel	http://www.gjcp.net/kelly.mp3 <- a wee demo of the ladspa vocoder I put together
2007-10-31T18:46:00.000Z	gordonjcp	noel	cool
