2009-07-20T08:30:00.000Z	gmoss		Hi all, I was playing around with mount options for one of my usb ntfs drives (not in fstab, just in right click -> properties -> drive -> mount options) and entered an invalid option, and now it won't let me remount. Where are these options stored, so I can delete the bad one? Thanks...
2009-07-20T08:31:00.000Z	Steve_	gmoss	that suxs
2009-07-20T08:32:00.000Z	Steve_	gmoss	what hapons when you try mount /dev/(what ever the drive is)
2009-07-20T08:32:00.000Z	gmoss	Steve_	yes...any clue as to where they are? I looked in ~/.gconfd/..., couldn't find anything...
2009-07-20T08:33:00.000Z	Steve_	gmoss	perhaps you can mount it then fix the problem that way
2009-07-20T08:34:00.000Z	gmoss	Steve_	well that'd involve adding it to fstab - would that interfere with whatever else is storing the settings?
2009-07-20T08:35:00.000Z	Steve_	gmoss	no fstab stuff... lets just try to mount it so you see it on your desktop so you can update the settings again
2009-07-20T08:36:00.000Z	gmoss	Steve_	sudo mount /dev/sdc1 asks for an fstab entry, will go make one and report back, thanks :-)
2009-07-20T08:37:00.000Z	Steve_	gmoss	sudo mount /dev/sdc1 /media/???/
2009-07-20T08:40:00.000Z	gmoss	Steve_	got it mounted again, thanks much!
2009-07-20T08:43:00.000Z	gmoss	Steve_	and maybe you know off the top of your head why the option "iocharset=utf8" is bad? if you're busy, don't bother, I'll continue googling :-
2009-07-20T08:44:00.000Z	Steve_	gmoss	o sorry im in a shitty IRC client is the charset bad?
2009-07-20T08:44:00.000Z	gmoss	Steve_	cyrillic filenames show up as '?', trying to fix this
2009-07-20T08:44:00.000Z	Steve_	gmoss	i dont think utf8 is bad.
2009-07-20T08:45:00.000Z	Steve_	gmoss	bad font?
2009-07-20T08:45:00.000Z	gmoss	Steve_	no, that's the option that broke the HAL mout
2009-07-20T08:46:00.000Z	gmoss	Steve_	I think I'll just ditch using HAL and go back to fstab, because I know how to get that working. Thanks a bunch for your help :-)
