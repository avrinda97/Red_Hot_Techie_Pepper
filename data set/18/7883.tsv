2007-10-31T06:54:00.000Z	adam300	oldsickclown	can you log in to mysql directly?
2007-10-31T06:57:00.000Z	adam300	oldsickclown	did you try sudo mysql -u root -p password ?
2007-10-31T06:57:00.000Z	adam300	oldsickclown	next I would just try sudo mysql
2007-10-31T06:59:00.000Z	adam300	oldsickclown	you mean you just downloaded mysql?
2007-10-31T06:59:00.000Z	adam300	oldsickclown	alright well you can reset it
2007-10-31T07:00:00.000Z	adam300	oldsickclown	kill the current mysql process and restart it with /usr/bin/safe_mysql --skip-grant-tables&
2007-10-31T07:02:00.000Z	adam300	oldsickclown	ps aux | grep mysql
2007-10-31T07:02:00.000Z	adam300	oldsickclown	our you can try /etc/inet.d/mysqld stop
2007-10-31T07:06:00.000Z	adam300	oldsickclown	you should be able to log into mysql if you are in safe
