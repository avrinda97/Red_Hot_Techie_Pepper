2010-06-06T07:42:00.000Z	pogs		hey all, 10.* live cds all appear to crash their own X server
2010-06-06T07:43:00.000Z	pogs		I'm on an IBM T30, is this normal???
2010-06-06T07:43:00.000Z	pogs		Safe graphics mode also causes X server crash on the live CD.
2010-06-06T07:44:00.000Z	pogs		I get a purple screen for a little while, then the X server crashes. Also, other people have had success running 10.04 on the T30, so I'm not sure why I'm the only one getting this error.
2010-06-06T07:45:00.000Z	pogs		Worked fine for 9.10 and opensolaris. Windows too, but that doesn't count.
2010-06-06T07:46:00.000Z	CountDuckula	pogs	what video card in laptop?
2010-06-06T07:47:00.000Z	pogs	CountDuckula	Radeon 7500 mobility (lol) :P
2010-06-06T07:48:00.000Z	CountDuckula	pogs	i know intel 810 and more recent kernels have caused x issues, you googled to see if the radeon is the same?
2010-06-06T07:49:00.000Z	CountDuckula	pogs	possibly variation in radeon maybe
2010-06-06T07:50:00.000Z	CountDuckula	pogs	eg video firmware maybe
2010-06-06T07:50:00.000Z	pogs	CountDuckula	five most terrifying words I've heard tonight
2010-06-06T07:51:00.000Z	CountDuckula	pogs	ah recent then...
2010-06-06T07:57:00.000Z	CountDuckula	pogs	how much memory allocated for video?
2010-06-06T07:58:00.000Z	pogs	CountDuckula	Oh man, it's a lot. Get ready. Are you ready? 16mb.
2010-06-06T07:59:00.000Z	CountDuckula	pogs	there are issues (once installed) with radeon 7500 crashing with less than 64mb for card
2010-06-06T08:00:00.000Z	pogs	CountDuckula	...
2010-06-06T08:02:00.000Z	CountDuckula	pogs	can you up the memory allocated to video in bios?
2010-06-06T08:03:00.000Z	pogs	CountDuckula	good idea. let me try...
