2009-07-27T00:58:00.000Z	VCoolio	Slart	thank you (I peeked into your irssi config too and managed to have irssi autojoin #ubuntu :)
2009-07-27T00:58:00.000Z	Slart	VCoolio	ah, you're welcome..  you can change that using some irssi command too.. =)
2009-08-08T15:39:00.000Z	Slart	VCoolio	I don't think you can "change" ntfs to ext3/4.. you'll probably have to remove the ntfs partition and create a new ext3/4 one
2009-08-08T15:41:00.000Z	VCoolio	Slart	ok, whatever the vocabulary, but that's the point: how to do it. I don't want to follow some obscure blogger's howto
2009-08-08T15:41:00.000Z	Slart	VCoolio	make sure you backup all the stuff you want to keep from the ntfs drive.. then start gparted, remove the ntfs partition.. create a new partition in it's place, format the new partition as ext3/4
2009-08-08T15:42:00.000Z	VCoolio	Slart	that's what I thought; but then what about single boot, fstab etc?
2009-08-08T15:43:00.000Z	Slart	VCoolio	if you want the drive to be mounted at boot you'll have to add it to your fstab... if you're already booting from grub you can just remove the lines about windows (they are usually at the bottom of the file /boot/grub/menu.lst)
2009-08-08T15:44:00.000Z	VCoolio	Slart	ok thx
2009-08-08T19:08:00.000Z	Slart	VCoolio	no need to reboot.. umount the drive and run "sudo mount -a" and you'll see if it works
2009-08-08T19:09:00.000Z	Slart	VCoolio	I can't help you with the actual fstab line though..
2009-08-08T19:10:00.000Z	VCoolio	Slart	if that's the same as nautilus' mount command I don't understand fstab, keeps complaining about either no permission or wrong mount options
2009-11-24T21:14:00.000Z	Slart	VCoolio	are you playing 5.1 audio? or just plain stereo music?
2009-11-24T21:15:00.000Z	VCoolio	Slart	should it matter? shouldn't it otherwise fall back to playing surround the same stream? but let me check
2009-11-24T21:16:00.000Z	Slart	VCoolio	if I understand things correctly ubuntu only plays 5.1 audio if you use 5.1-audio input.. there might be ways to convert your signal on the go from stereo to 5.1 but I'm not really sure how to do that with mpd.. perhaps dmix if that's still available
2009-11-24T21:17:00.000Z	VCoolio	Slart	ok, I'll google that, thx
2009-11-25T03:23:00.000Z	VCoolio	Slart	ever heard of tinyurl.com ?
2009-11-25T03:24:00.000Z	Slart	VCoolio	bah... you need to excercise that line breaking algorithm a little now and then =)
2010-01-14T22:56:00.000Z	VCoolio	Slart	the alturl.com link doesn't support karmic it seems
