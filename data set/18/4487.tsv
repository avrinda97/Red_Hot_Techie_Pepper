2009-04-05T17:56:00.000Z	him89	Stanley_	how did you mark the partition?
2009-04-05T17:57:00.000Z	Stanley_	him89	befor the mess i repaired the windows - partition with a ghost-image-based-reinstaller. this seems to mess it all up
2009-04-05T17:57:00.000Z	him89	Stanley_	i think you have crashed it or something
2009-04-05T17:59:00.000Z	Stanley_	him89	fdisk will not do this. "you cannot change a partition into an extended .. Delete it first."
2009-04-05T18:00:00.000Z	him89	Stanley_	try GParted
2009-04-05T18:00:00.000Z	Stanley_	him89	i have to installed it first. maybe i should install the network driver for eee-1000h first.
2009-04-05T18:01:00.000Z	Stanley_	him89	actually i am typing from another machine.
2009-04-05T18:02:00.000Z	Stanley_	him89	maybe it is too old (2.6.26.4) some alpha kind. i will download an actual disk.
2009-04-05T18:02:00.000Z	him89	Stanley_	GParted would still work
2009-04-05T18:03:00.000Z	Stanley_	him89	actually i have no gparted or GParted on the disk ...
