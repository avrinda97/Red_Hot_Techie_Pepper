2010-08-29T16:21:00.000Z	pksadiq		It's very dangerousto remove libc6
2010-08-29T16:21:00.000Z	ikonia	pksadiq	it's impossible
2010-08-29T16:23:00.000Z	ikonia	pksadiq	you can't remove it, as soon as you do, your system is dead
2010-10-31T14:40:00.000Z	ikonia	pksadiq	please join him in ##hardware to continue this debugging
2010-10-31T14:40:00.000Z	pksadiq	ikonia	k, sorry
2010-11-05T20:56:00.000Z	ikonia	pksadiq	you will need the firmware flashing tool provided by your device
2010-11-05T21:00:00.000Z	pksadiq	ikonia	? I's saying about Mass storage device
2010-11-05T21:01:00.000Z	ikonia	pksadiq	you need to use the tool your device provides
2010-11-05T21:05:00.000Z	pksadiq	ikonia	there isn't such a tool provided with device
2010-11-05T21:06:00.000Z	ikonia	pksadiq	then you can't do it
2010-11-05T21:09:00.000Z	pksadiq	ikonia	Why not? in windows I use the tools from flashboot.ru to change the firmware, but don't know How to do the same in linux, wine seems not to work well
2010-11-05T21:09:00.000Z	ikonia	pksadiq	don't update firmware using wine, and if you don't have a tool to do it, you can't do it
2011-04-14T13:49:00.000Z	pksadiq	ikonia	might be it will overwrite the boot loader, I don't beleive Windows M$
2011-04-14T13:50:00.000Z	ikonia	pksadiq	what ?
2011-04-14T13:51:00.000Z	pksadiq	ikonia	I mean don't recommend Danielcg25 to install to first partition, windowys try to be oversmart and put some partition table to a small 100MB partition
2011-04-14T13:51:00.000Z	ikonia	pksadiq	so ?
2011-04-14T13:52:00.000Z	pksadiq	ikonia	so if the first partition is formatted the whole harddisk might damage, I had such an error before
2011-04-14T13:52:00.000Z	ikonia	pksadiq	yes ? and, if you install to a partition it will blank it,
