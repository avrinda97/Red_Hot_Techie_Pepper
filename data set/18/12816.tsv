2006-03-15T09:27:00.000Z	pab1		guys, what is a popular backup sw that will do incremental?
2006-03-15T09:27:00.000Z	Arafangion	pab1	tar
2006-03-15T09:28:00.000Z	pab1		booo
2006-03-15T09:28:00.000Z	Arafangion	pab1	I personally wrote a set of scripts that uses cron, cp and rsync, but they are not in a state that can be given to other people.
2006-03-15T09:29:00.000Z	pab1		hmmm
2006-03-15T09:29:00.000Z	Arafangion	pab1	tar does work well - but it helps to not mix tar versions (ie, standardize on gnu tar)
2006-03-15T09:29:00.000Z	Arafangion	pab1	And tar _does_ do incremental.
2006-03-15T09:29:00.000Z	pab1	Arafangion	does rsync have a switch of some sort that will do incremental?
2006-03-15T09:30:00.000Z	Arafangion	pab1	rsync is by definition incremental. It keeps two directories in sync.
2006-03-15T09:30:00.000Z	Arafangion	pab1	Transferring the smallest amount required to bring them in sync.
2006-03-15T09:30:00.000Z	pab1	Arafangion	its not working as incremental for me then :/   im just using "rysnc -av"
2006-03-15T09:31:00.000Z	Arafangion	pab1	I use cp -lpr to link files.  rsync will *unlike* before changing the file.
2006-03-15T09:31:00.000Z	Arafangion	pab1	Thus, you have a number of incremental backups, but they magically appear to be "full" backups.
2006-03-15T09:31:00.000Z	pab1	Arafangion	ya i know
2006-03-15T09:32:00.000Z	Arafangion		rsnapshot is probably very similar to my system.
2006-03-15T09:32:00.000Z	pab1	Arafangion	i think im kinda looking for something that is used in a corporate setting  (Free though, of course)
2006-03-15T09:33:00.000Z	pab1	Arafangion	hehe
2006-03-15T09:33:00.000Z	Arafangion	pab1	tape drives and tar. ;)
