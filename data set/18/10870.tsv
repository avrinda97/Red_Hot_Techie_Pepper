2008-07-03T23:17:00.000Z	Fryguy--	X3	install boot to /dev/sdc
2008-07-03T23:17:00.000Z	Fryguy--	X3	MBR

2008-07-04T01:21:00.000Z	Fryguy--	X3	why do you have so many hard drives
2008-07-04T01:22:00.000Z	Fryguy--	X3	which hard drive do you use to boot your machine
2008-07-04T01:22:00.000Z	Fryguy--	X3	are you sure?
2008-07-04T01:24:00.000Z	Fryguy--	X3	and you are installing bootloader to (hd2) ?
2008-07-04T01:26:00.000Z	Fryguy--	X3	if you boot/install with just the IDE drive it still doesn't work?
2008-07-04T01:28:00.000Z	Fryguy--	X3	your windows is installed on /dev/sdc, which is your ide drive, right?
2008-07-04T01:28:00.000Z	Fryguy--	X3	so disconnect the 2 sata drives
2008-07-04T01:51:00.000Z	Fryguy--	X3	i've told you, don't install grub to sdc2
