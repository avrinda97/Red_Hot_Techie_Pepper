2007-10-24T08:30:00.000Z	jacquesmerde		is gnash up to scratch yet, or do i want adobe?
2007-10-24T08:30:00.000Z	sacater	jacquesmerde	try gnash
2007-10-24T08:30:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	sacater	"try" being the operative word?
2007-10-24T08:31:00.000Z	sacater	jacquesmerde	yep, adobe is propietary, if gnash has a probelm it may be easily fixable
2007-10-24T08:32:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	sacater	i know, but an open source piece of software has to reach a certain level of stability and features before you drop the proprietary one for it
2007-10-24T08:32:00.000Z	sacater	jacquesmerde	true enough
2007-10-24T08:32:00.000Z	sacater	jacquesmerde	if its stability you want use adobe
2007-10-24T08:33:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	sacater	eg i'm still using nvidia over nv so i can play games. but to have a computer running nothing but open source apps and drivers sounds like a wet dream to me
2007-10-24T08:33:00.000Z	sacater	jacquesmerde	:|
2007-10-24T08:56:00.000Z	sacater	jacquesmerde	better gnome integration?
2007-10-24T08:57:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	sacater	i thought it was more than that... besides, then why not scrap firefox for evolution?
2007-10-24T08:57:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	sacater	i mean, for epiphany
2007-10-24T08:58:00.000Z	sacater	jacquesmerde	because firefox is more well known, so newbies will be drawn to it
2007-10-24T08:58:00.000Z	sacater	jacquesmerde	i myself installed ubuntu, then installed fluxbox, xfce compiled from source, then installed kubuntu-desktop over the top
2007-10-24T08:58:00.000Z	sacater	jacquesmerde	i have LOADS of apps
2007-10-24T08:59:00.000Z	sacater	jacquesmerde	well no, they have probably used or heard of windows version of firefox though
2007-10-24T08:59:00.000Z	sacater	jacquesmerde	i use opera :P
2007-10-24T09:00:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	sacater	would you use opera without kde?
