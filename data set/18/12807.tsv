2006-11-16T15:52:00.000Z	rysiek|pl	Terminus	yeah, writing it down right now ;)
2006-11-16T15:55:00.000Z	Terminus	rysiek|pl	i'm not sure. sticky bit perhaps?
2006-11-16T15:55:00.000Z	rysiek|pl	Terminus	sticky bits, sayz thou. m'kay, checking
2006-11-16T15:56:00.000Z	Terminus	rysiek|pl	could also be setuid/setgid
2006-11-16T15:58:00.000Z	rysiek|pl	Terminus	setting the group's sticky-bit in dir solved it for the group, that's enough for me. thanks a lot.
2006-11-16T15:58:00.000Z	Terminus	rysiek|pl	ok. i think the proper way is with the setuid/setgid bits though. =)
2006-11-16T16:02:00.000Z	rysiek|pl	Terminus	what do you min setguid/setuid? I did chmod g+s dir
2006-11-16T16:03:00.000Z	Terminus	rysiek|pl	oh... chmod g+s is setgid. =)
2006-11-16T16:04:00.000Z	rysiek|pl	Terminus	=]  ...and chmod u+s is setuid (which, curiously enough, doesn't do anything for me)
2006-11-16T16:04:00.000Z	Terminus	rysiek|pl	i googled it and apparently, linux only uses setgid and sticky. setuid is ignored.
2006-11-16T16:07:00.000Z	rysiek|pl	Terminus	and any idea is there a way of satting a dir up so that all files/dirs created within are created with a specified umask?
2006-11-16T16:08:00.000Z	Terminus	rysiek|pl	no idea. how about crontab chmod for that dir?
2006-11-16T16:10:00.000Z	Terminus	rysiek|pl	i know the default umask is set in /etc/login.defs, but for a specific dir, i don't know...
2006-11-16T16:10:00.000Z	rysiek|pl	Terminus	that would be too easy, now wouldn't it? :) the thing is, I am setting a cvs repo and need the perms working AOK in the instant the file is created
2006-11-16T16:11:00.000Z	Terminus	rysiek|pl	isn't there a way for cvs to set the perms for you instead?
2006-11-16T16:11:00.000Z	rysiek|pl	Terminus	d'oh. haven't thought of that!
2006-11-16T16:13:00.000Z	Terminus	rysiek|pl	it should have settings for the owner too. then you wouldn't have to mess with setgid. =)
