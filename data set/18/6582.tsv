2011-05-15T20:37:00.000Z	Bill_MI		Hi folks, I have a dumb question.  Can I change a 32-bit 10.04 install to effectively the AMD64 install with a kernel change?
2011-05-15T20:37:00.000Z	syn-ack	Bill_MI	No
2011-05-15T20:37:00.000Z	syn-ack		not quite that simple
2011-05-15T20:38:00.000Z	syn-ack		you have to install the 64 bit userland as well
2011-05-15T20:38:00.000Z	Bill_MI		Thanks, syn-ack.  Is it complex enough a new install preferred?
2011-05-15T20:39:00.000Z	syn-ack	Bill_MI	it's a PITA enough to warrant a new install but it can be done
2011-05-15T20:39:00.000Z	syn-ack		yeah
2011-05-15T20:39:00.000Z	Bill_MI		Thanks, syn-ack.  Your advice is golden.  No relation to syn-ack on DSLR is it?
2011-05-15T20:39:00.000Z	syn-ack		resintall
2011-05-15T20:40:00.000Z	syn-ack		DSLR?
2011-05-15T20:40:00.000Z	Bill_MI	syn-ack	yeah an old friend on DSLReports uses the same name.
2011-05-15T20:40:00.000Z	syn-ack	Bill_MI	ah no
2011-05-15T20:41:00.000Z	syn-ack		I've had this as an irc nick for 11 years though
2011-05-15T20:41:00.000Z	syn-ack	Bill_MI	On DSLR I'm matt_eskes
2011-05-15T20:41:00.000Z	Bill_MI		Thanks, syn-ack.  I would guess SYN-ACK has been at least that long, too.  Gee, TCP is TCP LOL.
2011-05-15T20:42:00.000Z	syn-ack		heh
2011-05-15T20:42:00.000Z	Bill_MI		And thanks, escott  Supporting advice is always welcomed.  I'll reinstall.
2011-05-15T20:45:00.000Z	Bill_MI	syn-ack	I stand corrected.  He uses no hyphen: http://www.dslreports.com/useremail/u/334792
