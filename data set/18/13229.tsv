2007-01-25T11:33:00.000Z	kane77		is upgrade to edgy recommended?
2007-01-25T11:33:00.000Z	poningru	kane77	what kinda environment are you in?
2007-01-25T11:34:00.000Z	kane77	poningru	what do you mean? (gnome...)
2007-01-25T11:34:00.000Z	poningru	kane77	for desktop edgy is recommended but for server scenario its not
2007-01-25T11:34:00.000Z	kane77	poningru	is it safe? (people discouraged me a lot... that it's better to do a fresh install)
2007-01-25T11:35:00.000Z	poningru	kane77	did you use something like automatix, easyubuntu etc.?
2007-01-25T11:35:00.000Z	kane77	poningru	nah...
2007-01-25T11:35:00.000Z	poningru	kane77	then updating shouldnt give you much trouble
2007-01-25T11:36:00.000Z	kane77	poningru	but I have quite a bit of non default repositories...
2007-01-25T11:36:00.000Z	poningru	kane77	oh then not reccommended
2007-01-25T11:37:00.000Z	poningru	kane77	I would backup your data before doing it then
2007-01-25T11:37:00.000Z	kane77	poningru	heh.. so then I wont do it... i'll wait for feisty and then reinstall...
2007-03-05T12:59:00.000Z	kane77	poningru	where do I put that <canvas> stuff? Into .html?
2007-03-05T12:59:00.000Z	poningru	kane77	hehe its not that simple
2007-03-05T12:59:00.000Z	kane77	poningru	I've never heard of that.. going to google something up...
2007-09-30T14:17:00.000Z	poningru	kane77	use clonezilla
2007-09-30T14:17:00.000Z	poningru	kane77	or use tar
2007-09-30T14:20:00.000Z	kane77	poningru	do you mean to tar my whole drive? will it work if I later decide to restore ubuntu from it?
