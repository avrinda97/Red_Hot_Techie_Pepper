2007-04-19T10:11:00.000Z	imbecile		im trying to install ubuntu but before the live disk boots i get a kernel panic error.. any ideas?
2007-04-19T10:11:00.000Z	tekm8	imbecile	have you ran the disk for errors?
2007-04-19T10:12:00.000Z	tekm8	imbecile	could be a bad image
2007-04-19T10:12:00.000Z	imbecile	tekm8	yuppers.. its not just that disk either any linux distro gets the kernel error when trying to install
2007-04-19T10:13:00.000Z	tekm8	imbecile	do you have a raid configuration?
2007-04-19T10:13:00.000Z	imbecile	tekm8	i dont believe so.. i think the error may be because i was trying to install freebsd earlier
2007-04-19T10:14:00.000Z	tekm8	imbecile	so it hasn't happened before, just started?
2007-04-19T10:14:00.000Z	imbecile	tekm8	yes after i tried to install freebsd
2007-04-19T10:15:00.000Z	tekm8	imbecile	ok...sounds like you need to fdisk from a rescue cd before trying anything else, just wipe the hd clean
2007-04-19T10:16:00.000Z	tekm8	imbecile	i believe it might be trying to mount or read the mbr and it's corrupted, so it's kernal panic'ing
2007-04-19T10:17:00.000Z	imbecile	tekm8	which do u like better ultimate boot cd or trinity?
2007-04-19T10:17:00.000Z	tekm8	imbecile	hrm, good question....trinity is fine
2007-04-19T10:19:00.000Z	imbecile	tekm8	i tried the dang gparted live cd but that ot kernel errors too :(
2007-04-19T10:20:00.000Z	tekm8	imbecile	just download fdisk onto a cd and run that to wipe the drive
2007-04-19T10:20:00.000Z	tekm8	imbecile	if you can't seem to get the ultimate boot cd or trinity rescue disk to work
2007-04-19T10:21:00.000Z	imbecile	tekm8	hehe thats what i was just about to say.. no luck with the disks :(
2007-04-19T10:24:00.000Z	imbecile	tekm8	thanks for your help
2007-04-19T10:24:00.000Z	tekm8	imbecile	np...if you still can't get fdisk to work...gonna have to pull the hdd and slave it to a working system to wipe it
