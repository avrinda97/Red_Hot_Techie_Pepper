2011-08-13T01:58:00.000Z	rhcp		hey guys
2011-08-13T01:58:00.000Z	rhcp		Got a small question
2011-08-13T01:58:00.000Z	rhcp		I have grub on /dev/sda on MBR
2011-08-13T01:58:00.000Z	rhcp		and i have windows 7 on there
2011-08-13T01:58:00.000Z	rhcp		if i dlete the part using gpartd will i loose grub?
2011-08-13T02:00:00.000Z	ke1ha	rhcp	which partition are you talking about deleting?
2011-08-13T02:00:00.000Z	rhcp	ke1ha	my windows 7 which is on /dev/sda with bootflag
2011-08-13T02:00:00.000Z	ke1ha	rhcp	/dec/sda is the entire device, where /dev/sda1 is a partition on the device /dev/sda
2011-08-13T02:00:00.000Z	rhcp	ke1ha	sorry its on /dev/sda1
2011-08-13T02:01:00.000Z	ke1ha	rhcp	That was my next quesiton, what is the final set up you'd like to have, may dictate how best to approach it.
2011-08-13T02:02:00.000Z	ke1ha	rhcp	Back up critical data, reinstall and let Ubuntu use the entire disk, fastest & easiest.
2011-08-13T02:02:00.000Z	rhcp	ke1ha	i spent like a month setting up ubuntu :) im not about to nike it
2011-08-13T02:02:00.000Z	ke1ha	rhcp	You can certainly do all this manually,
2011-08-13T02:03:00.000Z	rhcp	ke1ha	using grub-install from live?
2011-08-13T02:04:00.000Z	ke1ha	rhcp	keeping grub is the easy part :-)
2011-08-13T02:05:00.000Z	ke1ha	rhcp	you have boot in your /root then or Ubuntu woun't boot at all :-)
2011-08-13T02:06:00.000Z	ke1ha	rhcp	it's probably / .. /boot
2011-08-13T03:02:00.000Z	ke1ha	rhcp	Hey, how did the Nuke /dev/sda1 go, things still working?
