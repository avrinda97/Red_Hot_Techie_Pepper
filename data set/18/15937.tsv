2005-01-12T17:19:00.000Z	emanuelez		Happy new year

2005-01-12T17:20:00.000Z	emanuelez		:)
2005-01-12T17:21:00.000Z	emanuelez		trying to convert a RedHad friendly demon start script... any simple way to convert it?
2005-01-12T17:22:00.000Z	nevyn	emanuelez	it doesn't run?
2005-01-12T17:23:00.000Z	emanuelez	nevyn	no it doesn't
2005-01-12T17:24:00.000Z	nevyn	emanuelez	sure
2005-01-12T17:26:00.000Z	emanuelez	nevyn	here it is: http://rafb.net/paste/results/NAMNT823.html
2005-01-12T17:28:00.000Z	nevyn	emanuelez	looks pretty straight forward
2005-01-12T17:29:00.000Z	emanuelez	nevyn	but it doesn't work... i bet there are better ways to start a daemon in debian/ubuntu
2005-01-12T17:33:00.000Z	nevyn	emanuelez	cp /etc/init.d/skeleton /etc/init.d/ccd ; edit to taste
2005-01-12T17:36:00.000Z	emanuelez	nevyn	i'll take a look
2005-01-12T17:45:00.000Z	emanuelez	nevyn	sorry... can't understand
2005-01-12T17:52:00.000Z	emanuelez	nevyn	could u please explain me your answer? i can't understand it?
2005-01-12T17:52:00.000Z	nevyn	emanuelez	there's a default script for starting daemons called skeleton
2005-01-12T17:53:00.000Z	emanuelez	nevyn	i did it and it works... my other question was about daemon starting order and telling ubuntu to run it on startup
2005-01-12T17:59:00.000Z	emanuelez	nevyn	something to do with rc2.d? do i have to write another script? :-S
