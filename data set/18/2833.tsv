2010-02-10T03:32:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Roald1	ZykoticK9, wicd used work well with the rt2870 ralink chip on jaunty , the upgrade to karmic appeared to kill any ability for the driver to connect. I've tried every tutorial I could find with no results. I'll be very happy if you guys can find a way to get the adapter work.
2010-02-10T03:33:00.000Z	Roald1	BluesKaj	given the fact that i'm a complete newbie, chances are small that i'm going to find the solution all by myself
2010-02-10T03:36:00.000Z	Roald1	BluesKaj	have you got any idea of another network manager i could use?
2010-02-10T03:37:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Roald1	wicd
2010-02-10T03:39:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Roald1	it might work with your router.I suspect my problem is with configuring my router to work with the wifi adapter
2010-02-10T03:48:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Roald1	did you set up wicd with encryption ?
2010-02-10T03:53:00.000Z	Roald1	BluesKaj	euhm no i didnt
2010-02-10T03:53:00.000Z	Roald1	BluesKaj	how do I set Wicd up with encryption?
2010-02-10T03:56:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Roald1	actually you set your router to encrypt your wifi signal with a password and wep or wpa or wpa2 encryption , then you set the wicd network manager to match
2010-02-10T03:58:00.000Z	Roald1	BluesKaj	problem is that I cant see my network in wicd
2010-02-10T04:00:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Roald1	set up the encryption in windows, but I suspect your wifi broadcast on the router is turned off
2010-02-10T04:00:00.000Z	Roald1	BluesKaj	No it isnt because i can still connect with  a laptop running vista
2010-02-10T04:01:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Roald1	whwt encryption are you using in windows?
2010-02-10T04:02:00.000Z	Roald1	BluesKaj	WPA personal
2010-02-10T04:02:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Roald1	then do the same with wicd
2010-02-10T04:04:00.000Z	Roald1	BluesKaj	I did that already, but he just keeps asking the password, which surely is correct
2010-02-10T04:08:00.000Z	BluesKaj	Roald1	there is an alternative that can be used with wicd or any network manager ,it's called ndiswrapper.
2010-02-10T04:09:00.000Z	Roald1	BluesKaj	yes I heard of that, but isnt that to install drivers for your wireless card?
