2008-10-08T21:09:00.000Z	FreshPrince		i've installed the flashplayer but i can't watch videos on firefox? why that?
2008-10-08T21:10:00.000Z	kbrosnan	FreshPrince	you may have conflicting flash players, uninstall gnash or swfdec players
2008-10-08T21:16:00.000Z	FreshPrince	kbrosnan	those are not installed, both of them
2008-10-08T21:17:00.000Z	kbrosnan	FreshPrince	as was asked above are you on a 64 bit os?
2008-10-08T21:17:00.000Z	FreshPrince	kbrosnan	no on x86
2008-10-08T21:17:00.000Z	kbrosnan	FreshPrince	does the flash plugin show up on tools -> addons-> plugins?
2008-10-08T21:22:00.000Z	FreshPrince	kbrosnan	well if i go to the add-ons he gives me an error: (Fehlercode: sec_error_expired_certificate)
2008-10-08T21:23:00.000Z	kbrosnan	FreshPrince	how about going to the plug-ins tab
2008-10-08T21:27:00.000Z	FreshPrince	kbrosnan	its nto listet there..
2008-10-08T21:28:00.000Z	kbrosnan	FreshPrince	type about:plugins in the address bar to double check, but it sounds like the flash player plugin is not correctly installed
2008-10-08T21:32:00.000Z	FreshPrince	kbrosnan	hum its not listet there.. well i installed flash with apt-get install flashplugin
2008-10-08T21:33:00.000Z	kbrosnan	FreshPrince	are you using a custom insatall of firefox? if you don't know check the output of which -a firefox
2008-10-08T21:34:00.000Z	FreshPrince	kbrosnan	the output brings me /usr/bin/firefox
2008-10-08T21:37:00.000Z	FreshPrince	kbrosnan	i dont know where the problem could be
2008-10-08T21:38:00.000Z	kbrosnan	FreshPrince	any plugins folder in ~/.mozilla or ~/.mozilla/firefox ?
2008-10-08T21:39:00.000Z	FreshPrince	kbrosnan	no
2008-10-08T21:41:00.000Z	kbrosnan	FreshPrince	my next thought would be to do a complete uninstall of the flash player then reinstall
