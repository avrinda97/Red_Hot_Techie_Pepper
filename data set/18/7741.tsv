2007-11-21T23:54:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	nomojob	permissionsd can get in the way
2007-11-21T23:55:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	nomojob	sudo nano   if needed
2007-11-22T06:03:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	nomojob	Do you need an example of the windows entry in a menu.lst
2007-11-22T06:04:00.000Z	nomojob	Jack_Sparrow	Sure

2007-11-22T06:06:00.000Z	nomojob	Jack_Sparrow	thank you
2007-12-03T22:07:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	nomojob	Try the super grub repair cd.. Windows really hates being on the second drive...  Did it ever work there.. or did you add a drive for UB and move the windows install to the secondary drive
2007-12-03T22:08:00.000Z	nomojob	Jack_Sparrow	I put Ubuntu on my second drive, but then made it to be the master.  I have not been able to start XP since I installed Ubuntu
2007-12-03T22:08:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	nomojob	exactly my point.. :)
2007-12-03T22:08:00.000Z	nomojob	Jack_Sparrow	what needs to be done then?
2007-12-03T22:09:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	nomojob	Put the windows drive back as master, format the second drive, then boot livecd and reinstall
2007-12-03T22:10:00.000Z	nomojob	Jack_Sparrow	it seems there should be a simpler way to do it.  Cant I somehow just get GRUB to locate XP in the other drive?
2007-12-03T22:12:00.000Z	nomojob	Jack_Sparrow	any thoughts on my last comment?
2007-12-03T22:12:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	nomojob	I told you the easiest and best way to fix it
2007-12-03T22:17:00.000Z	nomojob	Jack_Sparrow	I had similar issues when I first installed Ubuntu, only it was Error 21, and someone told me to make Ubuntu the master.  I originally installed Ubuntu the way you mentioned and it didnt work.  I can ask someone else if you are unsure of any other solution.
2007-12-03T22:18:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	nomojob	I suggested super grub repair...  Fixing the base issue of putting things back..  if ubuntu didnt work when you installed to the second drive with windows working then you installed grub to the wrong mbr or partition
2007-12-03T22:26:00.000Z	nomojob	Jack_Sparrow	thank you.
