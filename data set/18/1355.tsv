2011-12-16T04:22:00.000Z	brightspark	dany	do you know whether you have the drivers installed for your wireless card?
2011-12-16T04:22:00.000Z	brightspark	dany	on a new install these drivers are often not included by default
2011-12-16T05:14:00.000Z	brightspark	dany	why don't you give us a ls pastebin from inside the compat-wireless directory?

2011-12-16T05:17:00.000Z	brightspark	dany	that's from within your home directory, not the compat-wireless one
2011-12-16T05:18:00.000Z	dany	brightspark	can install teamviewer and access to my system
2011-12-16T05:22:00.000Z	dany	brightspark	I'm not familar with linux , can u plz guid me step by step
2011-12-16T05:23:00.000Z	dany	brightspark	download  here and access to my system
2011-12-16T05:24:00.000Z	brightspark	dany	this is a best guess, if you'd rather wait for Si2100 to get back that's fine.  I think you need to open a terminal, "cd compat-wireless-3.2-rc1-1", "sudo make install"

2011-12-16T05:26:00.000Z	dany	brightspark	what next
2011-12-16T05:27:00.000Z	brightspark	dany	you should reboot and check if it works.  I need to go in a minute, good luck
2011-12-16T05:28:00.000Z	dany	brightspark	ok just tell me how to check it when reboot
2011-12-16T05:28:00.000Z	brightspark	dany	click the wireless icon and see if you can see your router.
2011-12-16T05:29:00.000Z	brightspark	dany	or whatever wireless device you were trying to find in the first place
