2005-08-22T15:04:00.000Z	shinu		hi everyone
2005-08-22T15:04:00.000Z	shinu		i have a slightly strange thing going on...
2005-08-22T15:04:00.000Z	shinu		somethings taking up quite a lot of ram and i dont know what...
2005-08-22T15:04:00.000Z	senile_implant	shinu	try running top
2005-08-22T15:05:00.000Z	shinu	senile_implant	but i only have an xfce session on and some terminals...
2005-08-22T15:05:00.000Z	senile_implant	shinu	you can sort it by the amount of ram used
2005-08-22T15:05:00.000Z	shinu	senile_implant	might it be some dead process that quit improperly?
2005-08-22T15:05:00.000Z	senile_implant	shinu	i doubt it
2005-08-22T15:06:00.000Z	shinu	senile_implant	i had to kill some mplayers running a film from a dvd that didnt work properly...
2005-08-22T15:07:00.000Z	senile_implant	shinu	so you got it then?
2005-08-22T15:07:00.000Z	shinu	senile_implant	not really
2005-08-22T15:07:00.000Z	shinu	senile_implant	just a sec :P trying to figure out
2005-08-22T15:08:00.000Z	shinu	senile_implant	well... xorg takes up the most space... which is 3.9%... im talking about some 50% of my ram... :(
2005-08-22T15:10:00.000Z	senile_implant	shinu	you're sure that's %MEM and not %CPU you're looking at?
2005-08-22T15:11:00.000Z	shinu	senile_implant	im pretty sure yes, i presse shift + o to choose the sort field and then 'n'
2005-08-22T15:11:00.000Z	shinu	senile_implant	there is a %MEM above the thing im looking at ;)
2005-08-22T15:11:00.000Z	shinu	senile_implant	and now firefox is taking up 6%...
2005-08-22T15:12:00.000Z	shinu	senile_implant	could a killed process not free up the ram it used?
