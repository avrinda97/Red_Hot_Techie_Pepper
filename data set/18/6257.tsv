2008-06-01T11:11:00.000Z	frodubuntu		hey did anybody have the nick Nikunj93?
2008-06-01T11:11:00.000Z	SiliconViper	frodubuntu	* [Nikunj93] (n=ubuntu@59.93.243.204): purple
2008-06-01T11:12:00.000Z	frodubuntu	SiliconViper	what does that mean?
2008-06-01T11:12:00.000Z	SiliconViper	frodubuntu	it means yes, someone did have the nick.
2008-06-01T11:13:00.000Z	frodubuntu	SiliconViper	I accidentally added it to the ignore list
2008-06-01T11:13:00.000Z	SiliconViper	frodubuntu	then use /unignore?
2008-06-01T11:13:00.000Z	frodubuntu	SiliconViper	 since I'm not used to the x-chat, can you find out if Nikunj93 is still alive?
2008-06-01T11:14:00.000Z	SiliconViper	frodubuntu	/whois Nikunj93 would do that.
2008-06-01T11:15:00.000Z	SiliconViper	frodubuntu	/exec -o echo > ~/.xchat2/ignore.conf
2008-06-01T11:15:00.000Z	SiliconViper	frodubuntu	then reload XChat.
2008-06-01T11:15:00.000Z	SiliconViper	frodubuntu	that clears your ignore list, the easy way.
2008-06-01T11:16:00.000Z	frodubuntu	SiliconViper	thanks for your help, really :D
2008-06-01T11:19:00.000Z	frodubuntu	SiliconViper	well, thanks I'm back
2008-06-01T11:20:00.000Z	SiliconViper	frodubuntu	just remember: If someone asks something that YOU can help them with, please do. They'll appreciate it as much as you do, most of the time.
2008-06-01T11:21:00.000Z	frodubuntu	SiliconViper	yeah, I do, I really believe in returning a micro portion of what I get with all of this
