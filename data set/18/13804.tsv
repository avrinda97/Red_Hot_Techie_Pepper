2009-05-02T07:37:00.000Z	Hazuki		uuuuugh, this isn't working...I know I'm not the only one with this, these damn Broadcom chips are everywhere
2009-05-02T07:38:00.000Z	saki	Hazuki	what's the issue, I missed it.
2009-05-02T07:38:00.000Z	Hazuki	saki	broadcom bcm4312, PCI ID 14e4:4315. Nothing works ><
2009-05-02T07:38:00.000Z	Hazuki	saki	Restricted Driver manager has nothing for me, using the hydrib-portsrc from Broadcom's site doesn't work, that script coleys linked doesn't work...
2009-05-02T07:39:00.000Z	saki	Hazuki	is it at least seeing the device itself?
2009-05-02T07:39:00.000Z	Hazuki	saki	only with the wl from Broadcom installed. it sees it but the wifi light won't come on, it can't iwlist scan, and it won't connect to anything
2009-05-02T07:40:00.000Z	saki	Hazuki	is it listed under interfaces in ifconfig?
2009-05-02T07:40:00.000Z	Hazuki	saki	yes, but only after I have the Broadcom thing installed
2009-05-02T07:41:00.000Z	Hazuki	saki	before that, there's no trace of it anywhere but lspci
2009-05-02T07:41:00.000Z	saki	Hazuki	alright, did you ifconfig <interface> up?
2009-05-02T07:41:00.000Z	Hazuki	saki	yes
2009-05-02T07:42:00.000Z	saki	Hazuki	I'm sorry, just trying to get an ideal of where you're at.
2009-05-02T07:42:00.000Z	Hazuki	saki	I know...thanks for being so thorough :) I've actually been using Linux for 5 years and started on Gentoo
2009-05-02T07:43:00.000Z	saki	Hazuki	ah. Gentoo <3
2009-05-02T07:43:00.000Z	Hazuki		but this is just...no amount of knowledge will save a person from lack of drivers
2009-05-02T07:45:00.000Z	saki	Hazuki	sadly I'm having issues with my system hanging on iwlist with a rtl adapter XD
2009-05-02T07:45:00.000Z	Hazuki		wow O_O
2009-05-02T07:56:00.000Z	Hazuki	saki	coleys, now the driver is showing up in the restricted driver manager o_O But freezing when I tell it to activate
