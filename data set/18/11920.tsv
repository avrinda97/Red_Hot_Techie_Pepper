2006-06-17T05:51:00.000Z	chapium		alright people i have a challenge
2006-06-17T05:53:00.000Z	chapium		I'm trying to install ubuntu on a mac that already has ubuntu on it.  I don't know the pw, but its irrelevant since I'm wiping the drive anyways.  The problem is the Dapper Live CD has a bug that wont allow the kernel to work with older macs.  Supposedly the updated kernels work.  The kernel image already on the mac does work.  Can I boot the live cd and use the kernel thats on the hd?
2006-06-17T05:54:00.000Z	chapium		yep
2006-06-17T05:54:00.000Z	chapium		i used the same disc on another mac and it worked fine :D
2006-06-17T05:54:00.000Z	gavagai	chapium	just upgrade, don't do a fresh install from a live cd
2006-06-17T05:54:00.000Z	chapium	gavagai	i would upgrade if i knew the password
2006-06-17T05:55:00.000Z	gavagai	chapium	what about booting to single user mode
2006-06-17T05:55:00.000Z	chapium	gavagai	how?  off the live cd?
2006-06-17T05:55:00.000Z	gavagai	chapium	from grub there should be a way to boot into linux single
2006-06-17T05:55:00.000Z	gavagai		i have gotten into boxes that way before
2006-06-17T05:56:00.000Z	gavagai		i'm not sure how ubuntu behaves in single user mode though, i'm a recent convert
2006-06-17T05:56:00.000Z	gavagai		but if you can boot linux single then you'll have root access usually and can change the passwords
2006-06-17T05:57:00.000Z	chapium	gavagai	right,so I can gain root on any ubuntu computer from the boot prompt?  I doubt it
2006-06-17T05:57:00.000Z	gavagai	chapium	i can get root on any ubuntu computer i have physical access to, with few excpetions
2006-06-17T05:57:00.000Z	gavagai		physical access = root
2006-06-17T06:09:00.000Z	chapium	gavagai	wow you are right... i went right into root
2006-06-17T06:09:00.000Z	chapium		gavagai++
2006-06-17T06:10:00.000Z	gavagai	chapium	you're welcome!
