2006-06-15T14:20:00.000Z	roostishaw		how do i password protect a file in ubuntu?
2006-06-15T14:21:00.000Z	LjL	roostishaw	just make it readable for the appropriate user, and for nobody else
2006-06-15T14:21:00.000Z	roostishaw	LjL	but a few people use this same account... is there any software to do this?
2006-06-15T14:21:00.000Z	LjL	roostishaw	you could encrypt the file. why do several people use the same account?
2006-06-15T14:22:00.000Z	roostishaw	LjL	how do i encrypt it?
2006-06-15T14:22:00.000Z	LjL	roostishaw	a number of choice. you could use gpg i suppose
2006-06-25T06:58:00.000Z	LjL	roostishaw	... everything except your home?
2006-06-25T06:59:00.000Z	roostishaw	LjL	yes
2006-06-25T06:59:00.000Z	LjL	roostishaw	i mean, you will lose everything but your home. but that's quite obvious, so i'm not sure i understand the question
2006-06-26T16:30:00.000Z	LjL	roostishaw	if you did that... where?
2006-06-26T16:31:00.000Z	roostishaw	LjL	anywhere... if i have a var that ="00", and add one to it... would it then = 1 or 01?
2006-06-26T16:32:00.000Z	LjL	roostishaw	sorry, but that question makes no sense. it would depend on the language. languages don't just all behave the same way. in many languages, you couldn't *have* a *numeric* variable containing "00" in the first place
2006-06-26T06:32:00.000Z	roostishaw	LjL	cat: /home/roostishaw/.bashrc: No such file or directory
2006-06-26T06:33:00.000Z	LjL	roostishaw	well my version of the command was actually more of a joke than anything else, look at what the other said instead :-) although, i'd have bet it would work consistently
