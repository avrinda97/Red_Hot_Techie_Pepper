2009-05-02T13:43:00.000Z	trece8		it seems to me that nvidia is THE problem
2009-05-02T13:44:00.000Z	Gnea	trece8	actually, it's the solution, as it works better than most other 3d cards
2009-05-02T13:45:00.000Z	Gnea	trece8	maybe you're trying too hard. does it work with non-realtime linux?
2009-05-02T13:46:00.000Z	Gnea	trece8	that's not what I asked.
2009-05-02T13:48:00.000Z	Gnea	trece8	no idea. what's the max res your monitor goes to and how far will the linux-rt take it?
2009-05-02T13:49:00.000Z	Gnea	trece8	what's the max res the linux-rt will allow?
2009-05-02T13:49:00.000Z	Gnea	trece8	again, what's the max res that linux-rt will *allow*, regardless of which driver it's using?
2009-05-02T13:51:00.000Z	Gnea	trece8	try googling the GRE problem
2009-05-02T13:52:00.000Z	Gnea	trece8	is there a specific error message from the kernel or Xorg when the nvidia driver is attempted to be engaged?
2009-05-02T13:54:00.000Z	Gnea	trece8	the output of the dmesg command and /var/log/Xorg.0.log (please use the pastebin)
2009-05-02T13:54:00.000Z	Gnea	trece8	that's a contradiction of terms - the more detail involved can often times lead to a finer-tuned degree of distortion! ;)
2009-05-02T13:58:00.000Z	Gnea	trece8	it might help to install the pastebinit package to get the output to the site quicker
2009-05-02T13:59:00.000Z	Gnea	trece8	just don't go overboard and you'll be fine ;)
2009-05-02T14:01:00.000Z	Gnea	trece8	hrm, what version kernel are you on?  cat /proc/version please
2009-05-02T14:01:00.000Z	Gnea	trece8	clearly, you don't need the help.
2009-05-02T14:06:00.000Z	Gnea	trece8	there seems to be quite a bit of discussion of the problem already: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-rt/+bug/292270  http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=989262  https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-rt/+bug/301332
2009-05-02T14:09:00.000Z	Gnea	trece8	I'm not sure what else to recommend at this time... there's a lot of possibilities up there, so it'll just be a matter of finding the right one, if it's up there - and if not, well maybe following up on the bug report might help as well :)
2009-05-02T14:09:00.000Z	Gnea	trece8	good luck
