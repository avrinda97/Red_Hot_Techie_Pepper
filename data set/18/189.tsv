2012-06-21T09:33:00.000Z	holyfather	antonio_	ohhh  yeah. What are you rendering it to? H.264?
2012-06-21T09:34:00.000Z	holyfather	antonio_	on my i7 2600k clocked up to 5GHz a 2 hour movie can take 1.5hours
2012-06-21T09:35:00.000Z	holyfather	antonio_	lol what kind of computer you using?
2012-06-21T09:36:00.000Z	holyfather	antonio_	is it film clip?
2012-06-21T09:36:00.000Z	holyfather	antonio_	try using a profile with x264.
2012-06-21T09:38:00.000Z	holyfather	antonio_	I made a video on youtube how to compile and use ffmpeg. Also wrote a script to do all the work
2012-06-21T09:40:00.000Z	holyfather	antonio_	a bit old but might help you out. I am making a new video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0IDV6r-bCI
2012-06-21T09:45:00.000Z	holyfather	antonio_	what kind of cpu you have?
2012-06-21T09:45:00.000Z	antonio_	holyfather	that shouldn't matter...as it was working perfectly fine a few weeks ago
2012-06-21T09:46:00.000Z	holyfather	antonio_	sounds a bit fishy
2012-06-21T09:47:00.000Z	antonio_	holyfather	it shows waiting for like 2 or 3 minutes..then it starts to render
2012-06-21T09:48:00.000Z	holyfather	antonio_	how big is the org file? might be huge and you might have slow drives
2012-06-21T09:48:00.000Z	holyfather	antonio_	serisolly though kdenlive is the best video editing program on *nix.
2012-06-21T09:50:00.000Z	antonio_	holyfather	here is the terminal output http://paste.ubuntu.com/1052123/
2012-06-21T09:50:00.000Z	holyfather	antonio_	that video I put up on YT can play at 1080p and does not even need flash to watch it. A HTML5 browser that is.
