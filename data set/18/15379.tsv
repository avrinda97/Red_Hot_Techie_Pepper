2005-04-05T05:20:00.000Z	synic		has anyone set software raid up on ubuntu?
2005-04-05T05:21:00.000Z	synic		I know it doesn't support booting from software raid
2005-04-05T05:21:00.000Z	Absenth	synic	what raid level are you shooting for?
2005-04-05T05:21:00.000Z	synic	Absenth	1
2005-04-05T05:21:00.000Z	Absenth	synic	you "should" be able to configure a few partitions with fdisk, set the partition type to "fd" and then use raidhotadd
2005-04-05T05:22:00.000Z	synic	Absenth	right, I've actually got it set up, but currently root is not raid.
2005-04-05T05:22:00.000Z	Absenth	synic	Ahhh.....
2005-04-05T05:22:00.000Z	Absenth	synic	actually that's a great question.  one that might actually warrant a format of one of these computers.
2005-04-05T05:23:00.000Z	Absenth	synic	I'll tell you in a couple min.....  booting it to the cd now.
2005-04-05T05:24:00.000Z	Absenth	synic	I'll try a basic install first, and then go back and try an expert install.
2005-04-05T05:26:00.000Z	Absenth	synic	when you get to the partition your disk option (the one that offers to use the entire disk, there's a manually configure option below it)
2005-04-05T05:26:00.000Z	Absenth	synic	on the standard install.
2005-04-05T05:26:00.000Z	synic	Absenth	yeah, that's what I did this time
2005-04-05T05:26:00.000Z	Absenth	synic	ahh....  give me another couple min :)
2005-04-05T05:28:00.000Z	Absenth	synic	I'm thinking that this utility is crap.
2005-04-05T05:29:00.000Z	synic	Absenth	how come?  I thought it was pretty cool
2005-04-05T05:29:00.000Z	Absenth	synic	but I could be wrong, lemme see if "expert" gives me fdisk.
2005-04-05T05:36:00.000Z	Absenth	synic	take a look at www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/InstallingToRAID1
