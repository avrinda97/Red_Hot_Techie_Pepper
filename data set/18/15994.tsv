2004-12-07T09:29:00.000Z	tenco		why is the package paw++/paw not installable over universe ubuntu despite its available in debian
2004-12-07T09:29:00.000Z	tenco		?
2004-12-07T09:30:00.000Z	Kamion	tenco	when was it added to Debian?
2004-12-07T09:30:00.000Z	Kamion	tenco	we froze universe in June 2004
2004-12-07T09:33:00.000Z	tenco	Kamion	iam not sure. packages.debian.org reports a version "2004.01.20-8" for i386
2004-12-07T09:34:00.000Z	Kamion	tenco	that's available in hoary universe (although not for amd64)
2004-12-07T09:34:00.000Z	Kamion	tenco	chances are it just didn't build properly for warty
2004-12-07T09:34:00.000Z	Kamion	tenco	in general we put very little effort into fixing build problems in universe
2004-12-07T09:34:00.000Z	tenco	Kamion	yes, but paw-common, which is needed by paw++, is not
2004-12-07T09:35:00.000Z	Kamion	tenco	sure it is, I see it
2004-12-07T09:35:00.000Z	Kamion		Package: paw-common
2004-12-07T09:35:00.000Z	Kamion		Priority: optional
2004-12-07T09:35:00.000Z	Kamion		Section: universe/science
2004-12-07T09:36:00.000Z	tenco	Kamion	not in my selection
2004-12-07T09:37:00.000Z	tenco	Kamion	is synaptic updating the universe package-list?
2004-12-07T09:37:00.000Z	tenco	Kamion	or should i go for apt-get update?
2004-12-07T09:39:00.000Z	Kamion	tenco	should do if it's in sources.list
