2010-08-29T01:59:00.000Z	Habstinat	jrib	apparently sun-java6-jre package, the one that the article you sent me told me I had to install, doesn't exist (and yes, I have added the universe repository) and the closest one to it, "Sun Java 6.0 Plugin", is not available on my 64-bit machine.
2010-08-29T01:59:00.000Z	jrib	Habstinat	it's not in the universe repository, read more closely :)
2010-08-29T02:01:00.000Z	jrib	Habstinat	I don't know if it's hard to find the info in the link, but just read what ubottu said
2010-08-29T02:02:00.000Z	Habstinat	jrib	oh, thanks, I was looking in the article.
2010-08-29T02:02:00.000Z	jrib	Habstinat	if the article contradicts that and you have a spare minute, would be great if you added a note :)
2010-08-29T02:04:00.000Z	Habstinat	jrib	when I try to reload my package information after adding the lucid partner, I get this error: http://paste.ubuntu.com/485137/
2010-08-29T02:06:00.000Z	jrib	Habstinat	you used add-apt-repository?
2010-08-29T02:07:00.000Z	Habstinat	jrib	I did it with the Synaptic GUI in Settings > Repositories > Other Software.
2010-08-29T02:08:00.000Z	jrib	Habstinat	hmm, not sure if that adds the gpg key, but I guess not
2010-08-29T02:08:00.000Z	Habstinat	jrib	I'll try using add-apt-repository now.
2010-08-29T02:08:00.000Z	jrib	Habstinat	(you need to add the gpg key yourself)
2010-08-29T02:09:00.000Z	Habstinat	jrib	what is the gpg key and how would I go about adding it?
2010-08-29T02:12:00.000Z	jrib	Habstinat	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/Ubuntu#Authentication Tab is the closest I can get, but basically just use apt-key
2010-08-29T02:13:00.000Z	Habstinat	jrib	Ok, I'll try that.
2010-08-29T02:22:00.000Z	Habstinat	jrib	so basically I should import the key file of the ubuntu lucid partner? And where does apt-key come in to play? :S
2010-08-29T02:22:00.000Z	jrib	Habstinat	it's in the link I gave you
2010-08-29T02:22:00.000Z	jrib	Habstinat	that adds the key to the keys apt should trust
2010-08-29T02:25:00.000Z	Habstinat	jrib	Thank you, I was able to add the repository, I think. The packages are showing up now.
