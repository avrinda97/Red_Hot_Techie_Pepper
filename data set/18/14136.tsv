2005-09-15T08:35:00.000Z	shawnz	BlueEagle	tell that to my box.
2005-09-15T08:36:00.000Z	BlueEagle	shawnz	Ofcourse shady hardware helps make your system unstable. :)
2005-09-15T08:36:00.000Z	BlueEagle	shawnz	Well, rebooting didn't fix much then. :) What caused the ailments?
2005-09-15T08:38:00.000Z	BlueEagle	shawnz	That won't break your installation. Just might throw a monkeywrench in X. A simple re-installation of the fonts package should fix that. Easily done from the console. The trickiest part is figuring out which package that is. :)

2006-08-10T08:31:00.000Z	shawnz	BlueEagle	logging in as them is a lot different than needing to su to them.
2006-08-10T08:39:00.000Z	shawnz	BlueEagle	sudoedit works too
2006-08-10T08:53:00.000Z	shawnz	BlueEagle	they meant they did the restart now
