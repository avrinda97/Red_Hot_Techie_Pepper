2008-10-13T23:35:00.000Z	anavarro		hey everybody this is my pastebin url http://paste.ubuntu.com/57097/
2008-10-13T23:35:00.000Z	anavarro		please give a help
2008-10-13T23:37:00.000Z	anavarro		<KDB9000> is making me crazy
2008-10-13T23:37:00.000Z	KDB9000	anavarro	are you installing to a server edition or a GUI one?
2008-10-13T23:39:00.000Z	KDB9000	anavarro	have you tried it without the purge command?
2008-10-13T23:41:00.000Z	KDB9000	anavarro	run this command and let me know what shows up "ps -A | grep mysql"
2008-10-13T23:45:00.000Z	KDB9000	anavarro	ok, mysql is still up and running. lets try stopping it manually, run "/etc/init.d/mysql stop"
2008-10-13T23:47:00.000Z	KDB9000	anavarro	ya, sorry forgot the sudo
2008-10-13T23:47:00.000Z	KDB9000	anavarro	seems like it doesn't want to go down, is it being used right now?
2008-10-13T23:49:00.000Z	KDB9000	anavarro	try it and then do the "ps -A | grep mysql"
2008-10-13T23:50:00.000Z	KDB9000	anavarro	if that doesn't take it down i am out of ideas for stopping it other then a kill with the PID number (which the ps command gives you). but you should stop it first then try removing it
2008-10-13T23:50:00.000Z	KDB9000	anavarro	did the killall work?
2008-10-13T23:51:00.000Z	KDB9000	anavarro	ok try to remove it now
2008-10-13T23:52:00.000Z	KDB9000	anavarro	synaptic is GUI, so just do the apt-get, run the same command you tried before
2008-10-13T23:53:00.000Z	KDB9000	anavarro	i got to go, if you have any more problems i am sure one of the other guys in here will be happy to help you. good luck
2008-10-13T23:53:00.000Z	KDB9000	anavarro	it worked?
2008-10-13T23:54:00.000Z	KDB9000	anavarro	i am not sure. never tried to removed mysql. i have to get going, so many one of the other guys and answer that question or even google might be able too
2008-10-13T23:55:00.000Z	KDB9000	anavarro	no problem
