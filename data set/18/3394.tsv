2009-10-16T04:10:00.000Z	BoxMagnet		Can anyone tell me why i must use sudo su to echo -n 95 > /proc/acpi/video/GFX0/DD03/brightness
2009-10-16T04:10:00.000Z	BoxMagnet		sudo does not work nor, sudo -s
2009-10-16T04:10:00.000Z	LjL	BoxMagnet	because > gets processed by the shell, which doesn't have any root permissions.
2009-10-16T04:10:00.000Z	BoxMagnet	LjL	can you instruct?
2009-10-16T04:11:00.000Z	LjL	BoxMagnet	i what?
2009-10-16T04:11:00.000Z	LjL	BoxMagnet	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RootSudo#Downsides of using sudo
2009-10-16T04:12:00.000Z	LjL	BoxMagnet	you can use, instead, either « sudo sh -c "command > /proc/whatever" »,  or you can use « sudo command | tee /proc/whatever » to circumvent that
2009-10-16T04:15:00.000Z	LjL	BoxMagnet	sudo tee
2009-10-16T04:20:00.000Z	BoxMagnet	LjL	anyway I can get sudo to not ask a password so I can make that in to a script?
2009-10-16T04:21:00.000Z	LjL	BoxMagnet	that would be quite dangerous. are you intending to do that every time you start your computer?
2009-10-16T04:21:00.000Z	BoxMagnet	LjL	um, no ... on command for several different settings.
2009-10-16T04:22:00.000Z	LjL	BoxMagnet	not making it ask for a password is going to be tricky.
2009-10-16T04:22:00.000Z	BoxMagnet	LjL	err, im sorry. the real reason this is all going on is because I have absolutelty no idea how to make my laptop function keys work
2009-10-16T04:22:00.000Z	LjL	BoxMagnet	which laptop is that? there are some packages for that in the repos
2009-10-16T04:22:00.000Z	BoxMagnet	LjL	Hp Pavillion dv6000
2009-10-16T04:24:00.000Z	LjL	BoxMagnet	uhm no i can't find anything (doesn't mean there isn't, just isn't exceptionally easy to find)
2009-10-16T04:26:00.000Z	BoxMagnet	LjL	hmm ok. bright up is fn+f8 down is f7 so. how would I want to go about making that + fn work?
2009-10-16T04:27:00.000Z	LjL	BoxMagnet	i don't know, its tricky :|
