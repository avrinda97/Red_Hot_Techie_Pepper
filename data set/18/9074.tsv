2007-05-17T09:16:00.000Z	Felarin	Jaboia	You mean either Compiz or Beryl? They work ootb with Feisty using AIGLX. XGL is not used by default in Feisty.
2007-05-17T09:16:00.000Z	Jaboia	Felarin	not with the closed source fglrx drivers ?
2007-05-17T09:16:00.000Z	Felarin	Jaboia	Actually Feisty includes only Compiz i believe. I opt for Beryl instead.
2007-05-17T09:17:00.000Z	Felarin	Jaboia	I use it with Nvidia drivers on my box. Used Envy script to get the drivers in.
2007-05-17T09:17:00.000Z	Jaboia	Felarin	yes - but IGxMyzt  needs to play games and the open source drivers with aiglx wont cut it for that
2007-05-17T09:19:00.000Z	Felarin	Jaboia	I suppose that has to do with the fact that most Linux users are not using it from young. We tend to start on such stuff at a slightly later age as compared to exposure with MS Windows. Most of us get that early on.
2007-05-17T09:20:00.000Z	Jaboia	Felarin	how do you mean ? using what from young ?
2007-05-17T09:21:00.000Z	Felarin	Jaboia	I meant that most of the world gets exposure to Windows first. Dependence is grown on that and since the majority of the world depends on Windows, that's where the money is. Game devs need to make money too so they push for that. Hence games for Linux are in a much smaller scale. Linux devs don't see the point of developing stuff for games when game developers don't make Linux ports in the first place.
2007-05-17T09:22:00.000Z	Felarin	Jaboia	Not to mention the fact that MS is actually thriving on keeping the gaming community glued on MS Windows by pushing devs to develop using DX10 API
2007-05-17T09:22:00.000Z	Felarin	Jaboia	: If you could game heavily on Linux, most hardcore gamers would drop Windows for Linux, just for performance reasons alone.
2007-05-17T09:23:00.000Z	Felarin	Jaboia	Not to mention the fact that DX10 is only for Vista and that is even pushing gamers to upgrade to Vista.
2007-05-17T09:23:00.000Z	Jaboia	Felarin	yep - spot on
2007-05-17T09:25:00.000Z	Jaboia	Felarin	sholsinger, yep. I am now running 100% inux on my computers and love it - but I've bought an xbox 360 for gaming. MS somehow manage to get their foot in somewhere either way.
2007-05-17T09:26:00.000Z	Jaboia	Felarin	sholsinger, Yes it seems fine - but i couldnt justify the ps3 price and lack of games
2007-05-17T09:27:00.000Z	Jaboia	Felarin	sholsinger, also my brother already owns a wii. I love nintendo so i bought an xbox so we could trade at times
2007-05-17T09:36:00.000Z	Felarin	Jaboia	I heard that VMWare Workstation's new beta version has D3D support in testing phase. In future, you could possibly game on XP or Vista VMs
2007-05-17T09:36:00.000Z	Jaboia	Felarin	sounds promising.
2007-05-17T09:36:00.000Z	Jaboia	Felarin	However the ideal would be for developers to consider both opengl and directx during development, and then ship both linux and windows versions simultaneously
