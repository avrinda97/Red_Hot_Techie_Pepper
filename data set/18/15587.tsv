2005-02-23T17:58:00.000Z	delphi		does ubuntu live cd work ok with nvidia cards? we have 2 machines here, and it won't boot into a gui properly on either.
2005-02-23T17:58:00.000Z	randabis	delphi	depends on what nvidia card and which version of the livecd
2005-02-23T17:59:00.000Z	randabis	delphi	might wanna try one of the hoary livecds

2005-02-23T06:00:00.000Z	delphi	randabis	thank you. i'll download and try
2005-02-23T06:01:00.000Z	randabis	delphi	here's a link to the latest
2005-02-23T06:02:00.000Z	delphi	randabis	thanks, coming down now.
2005-02-23T06:03:00.000Z	randabis	delphi	kde isn't on the livecd
2005-02-23T06:04:00.000Z	delphi	randabis	sure, I understand that. but, if i was to install, I presume it's just an apt-get away?
2005-02-23T06:04:00.000Z	randabis	delphi	sure. I usually perform daily apt-get dist-upgrades
2005-02-23T06:05:00.000Z	randabis	delphi	it's the best debian-based distro out there imho
2005-02-23T06:06:00.000Z	delphi	randabis	sounds interesting. have you tried/compared it with mepis?
2005-02-23T06:07:00.000Z	delphi	randabis	not keen on it?
2005-02-23T06:07:00.000Z	randabis	delphi	no, mostly because of kde and the layout
2005-02-23T06:08:00.000Z	delphi	randabis	fair enough. I must admit, the layout of the screen shots for ubunto seem very well thought out.
2005-02-23T06:18:00.000Z	delphi	randabis	will a daily upgrade keep hoary completely up-to-date?
2005-02-23T06:18:00.000Z	randabis	delphi	yep, as long as there were updates that day
2005-02-23T06:20:00.000Z	delphi	randabis	and that's for hoary as well as the debian archives? in other words, when gnome 2.10 beta 3 comes out, it will update that to?
