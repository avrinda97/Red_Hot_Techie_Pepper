2012-06-16T12:37:00.000Z	flaviu		My resolution always resets after reboot. Running nvidia. Help please?
2012-06-16T12:38:00.000Z	gigix	flaviu	what card, what version of ubuntu, what driver ?
2012-06-16T12:39:00.000Z	flaviu	gigix	8600GS, Ubuntu 12.04, nVidia Driver
2012-06-16T12:40:00.000Z	gigix	flaviu	did it work ok with the nouveau driver ?
2012-06-16T12:42:00.000Z	gigix	flaviu	why not sticking with it then ?
2012-06-16T12:42:00.000Z	flaviu	gigix	No HW acceleration, without it, you can't call it computer
2012-06-16T12:43:00.000Z	gigix	flaviu	unless you want to play games with your 8600, you don't need the proprietary driver tbh
2012-06-16T12:43:00.000Z	flaviu	gigix	I am getting edid error in xorg.0.log. I tried to bypass the with loads of options, but I always get one about DPI, after that, it sets the refresh rate to 60
2012-06-16T12:43:00.000Z	flaviu	gigix	I don't want to play games, hd movies
2012-06-16T12:45:00.000Z	gigix	flaviu	the open source driver runs very fine for old hardware, Nvidia does not care about your old 8600 on the other end...
2012-06-16T12:47:00.000Z	gigix	flaviu	there's a small section on this problem here: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/Nvidia, have you tired it ?
2012-06-16T12:47:00.000Z	flaviu	gigix	The G81 cards are supported, even the 6k series.
2012-06-16T12:51:00.000Z	gigix	flaviu	what about the link to the ubuntu documentation ?
2012-06-16T12:52:00.000Z	flaviu	gigix	thanks, but my answer is not there. Searched the web like crazy, There's no solution for VGA, I guess
2012-06-16T12:57:00.000Z	gigix	flaviu	it's weird, I've got a similar machine at work and the only thing I did was to use nvidia-settings to set-up my resolution on mu dual-monitor config, save it to a new /etc/X11/xorg.conf and that was it
2012-06-16T12:58:00.000Z	flaviu	gigix	vga cable?
2012-06-16T13:03:00.000Z	gigix	flaviu	not sure if VGA or DVI :S
2012-06-16T13:09:00.000Z	gigix	flaviu	no solution proposed on this page
