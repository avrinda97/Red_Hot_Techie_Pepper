2011-12-23T07:33:00.000Z	sumosu		if i compile my kernel for core2duo... it will be a 64 bit kernel?
2011-12-23T07:34:00.000Z	DrPenguin	sumosu	just because you compile for a processor it wont make it a 64bit kernel.. i believe there are 32bit core 2 duo procs
2011-12-23T07:37:00.000Z	sumosu	DrPenguin	but youre not sure?
2011-12-23T07:37:00.000Z	DrPenguin	sumosu	no i am pretty sure there are 32bit core 2 duo processors
2011-12-23T07:38:00.000Z	sumosu	DrPenguin	c2d processors have a 32 and a 64 bit mode
2011-12-23T07:38:00.000Z	sumosu	DrPenguin	?
2011-12-23T07:40:00.000Z	sumosu	DrPenguin	uhm.. help me out then. c2d supports both 32 and 64 bit mode. there are processors that only support one or the other
2011-12-23T07:41:00.000Z	DrPenguin	sumosu	dude, what is this with you and "mode"? A processor is either a 32bit or 64bit processor
2011-12-23T07:46:00.000Z	sumosu	DrPenguin	uhm but it talks aboout "native 64 bit mode" explicitly
2011-12-23T07:48:00.000Z	DrPenguin	sumosu	â€¦ you want a processor that has no 32bit support?
2011-12-23T07:48:00.000Z	sumosu	DrPenguin	but you cant run 64 bit OS on a 32 bit only processor
2011-12-23T07:49:00.000Z	DrPenguin	sumosu	um.. duh
2011-12-23T07:49:00.000Z	sumosu	DrPenguin	so how can it be OS only?
2011-12-23T07:49:00.000Z	sumosu	DrPenguin	uhm yea... processors without 32 bit support. i thought they were out already
2011-12-23T07:50:00.000Z	DrPenguin	sumosu	I have never heard of a 64bit processor that has no 32bit support, imo that sounds like it would be foolish considering how widespread 32bit is still used
2011-12-23T08:00:00.000Z	DrPenguin	sumosu	you can edit sudoers in a way that it doesnt require a password for the access raise
2011-12-23T08:03:00.000Z	sumosu	DrPenguin	hmm im googling but this doesnt add up to a solution....
2011-12-23T08:05:00.000Z	DrPenguin	sumosu	if you google just about the sudoers file, you should be able to find the info neeed
