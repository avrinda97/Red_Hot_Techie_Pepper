2007-06-30T15:31:00.000Z	AlexC_		Morning all,
2007-06-30T15:32:00.000Z	AlexC_		If anyone knows anything about xgettext - could they take a quick peek at this please? http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=488412
2007-06-30T15:34:00.000Z	AlexC_		does anyone know anything about xGettext and how to get it to match a different pattern instead of _() or gettext() - I need it to match {L_[Hello over there!] }
2007-06-30T15:35:00.000Z	gordonjcp	AlexC_	what exactly are you trying to do?
2007-06-30T15:36:00.000Z	AlexC_	gordonjcp	did you see the link I posted? http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=488412
2007-06-30T15:37:00.000Z	gordonjcp	AlexC_	hm
2007-06-30T15:38:00.000Z	gordonjcp	AlexC_	how does xgettext find the text tags as it is?
2007-06-30T15:38:00.000Z	AlexC_	gordonjcp	it doesn't, normally you would just add "echo _( 'Text to be translated' );" or "echo gettext( 'Text to be translated' );" and when you run xgettext it will automatically pick that up (as that is what the default is)
2007-06-30T15:39:00.000Z	gordonjcp	AlexC_	yes, exactly
2007-06-30T15:39:00.000Z	gordonjcp	AlexC_	how does it find those tagged bits of text?
2007-06-30T15:39:00.000Z	gordonjcp	AlexC_	probably some internal regex
2007-06-30T15:39:00.000Z	AlexC_	gordonjcp	probably, which I need to change
2007-06-30T15:39:00.000Z	gordonjcp	AlexC_	use the source, Luke
2007-06-30T15:40:00.000Z	AlexC_	gordonjcp	hehe, yes I tried sudo apt-get source gettext before (xgettext doesn't seem to exist, so it must be part of it?) but I can't find it anywhere for the life of me
2007-06-30T15:40:00.000Z	gordonjcp	AlexC_	grep is your friend
2007-06-30T15:40:00.000Z	AlexC_		haha, speak of the devil - found it, gordonjcp
2007-06-30T15:40:00.000Z	AlexC_		now to edit the souce
2007-06-30T15:41:00.000Z	gordonjcp	AlexC_	anjuta has some tools to show where functions are defined and used
