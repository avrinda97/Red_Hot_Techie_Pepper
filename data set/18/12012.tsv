2007-03-29T09:12:00.000Z	harry_		it's at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/12709/
2007-03-29T09:13:00.000Z	harry_		ok.
2007-03-29T09:14:00.000Z	harry_		whoops.
2007-03-29T09:15:00.000Z	harry_		I am trying to make an annoying beeping sound in the mornig. My alarm clock isn't very good.
2007-03-29T09:15:00.000Z	harry_		I was going to use cron
2007-03-29T09:16:00.000Z	Pelo	harry_	 how about a meeting in evolution, I think you can set the alarm.wav you want
2007-04-02T07:29:00.000Z	Pelo	harry_	 have you considered gnome-office ?
2007-04-02T07:32:00.000Z	Pelo	harry_	 I beleive that openoffice has it's own system requirements on their site,  should not vary with the os or the distro
2007-04-02T07:34:00.000Z	harry_	Pelo	If you're running xfce rather than gnome, won't that be less work for it to do on the side?
2007-04-02T07:34:00.000Z	Pelo	harry_	 that means that you'll have less resources used by your os so more for the apps
2007-04-02T07:36:00.000Z	Pelo	harry_	 http://www.openoffice.org/dev_docs/source/sys_reqs_20.html
2007-04-16T07:31:00.000Z	Pelo	harry_	  check the system monitor see what is eating us your cpu
2007-04-19T06:54:00.000Z	Pelo	harry_	 you can always hide it
2007-04-19T06:55:00.000Z	harry_	Pelo	I want to see it, but just a bit thinner. I guss that's not really an option then?
2007-04-19T06:55:00.000Z	Pelo	harry_	 you can try looking in gconf-editor
2007-04-19T06:55:00.000Z	harry_	Pelo	How do I do that?
2007-04-19T06:56:00.000Z	Pelo	harry_	 terminal, type   gconf-editor
2007-05-21T09:13:00.000Z	Pelo	harry_	 ask in #winehq
