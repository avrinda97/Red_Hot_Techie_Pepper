2009-01-25T16:37:00.000Z	fmeff001		is it possible to generate a xorg.conf-file from a running xserver with a ubuntu livecd???
2009-01-25T16:38:00.000Z	duryodhan	fmeff001	just copy the xorg.conf in /etc/
2009-01-25T16:38:00.000Z	fmeff001	duryodhan	the one in /etc/ looks really sparse, it has no config-options!
2009-01-25T16:39:00.000Z	duryodhan	fmeff001	what config options ?
2009-01-25T16:40:00.000Z	duryodhan	fmeff001	what are you trying to achieve ?
2009-01-25T16:40:00.000Z	fmeff001	duryodhan	i have an intel GMA965 chipset which runs better under ubuntu, so i would like to know, which options ubuntu uses, but /etc/X11/xorg.conf is really sparse and desn't contain further information
2009-01-25T16:41:00.000Z	duryodhan	fmeff001	better under ubuntu as in .. even in the live cd .. ?
2009-01-25T16:42:00.000Z	fmeff001	duryodhan	actually im using archlinux, and the gfx-performance under ubuntu is better (glxgears 250 vs. 600 fps)
2009-01-25T16:43:00.000Z	duryodhan	fmeff001	ok .. so when you are running the live cd .. the file in /etc/X11/xorg.conf is the file that is being used...
2009-01-25T16:43:00.000Z	duryodhan	fmeff001	there are NO config options per se .. its just the correct driver
2009-01-25T16:44:00.000Z	duryodhan	fmeff001	so just copy the file to your archlinux's xorg.conf and run arch
2009-01-25T16:44:00.000Z	fmeff001	duryodhan	hmk, so perhaps i have too much options on, which turns down performance ...
2009-01-25T16:45:00.000Z	duryodhan	fmeff001	what options?
2009-01-25T16:47:00.000Z	fmeff001	duryodhan	http://www.pastie.org/370101
2009-01-25T16:48:00.000Z	duryodhan	fmeff001	so ?
2009-01-25T16:49:00.000Z	fmeff001	duryodhan	these are the options
2009-01-25T16:50:00.000Z	duryodhan	fmeff001	I am saying .. save a backup .. copy ubuntu''s xorg.conf over your arch's version and run arch
2009-01-25T16:50:00.000Z	fmeff001	duryodhan	i'll give it a try, thx
