2007-08-27T08:40:00.000Z	jacquesmerde		am new to debian-based distros. when installing a random app from source that isnt in any repos, is there an easy way to turn it into a .deb?
2007-08-27T08:41:00.000Z	nosklo	jacquesmerde	that would depend on your definition of "easy"
2007-08-27T08:41:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	nosklo	... try me!
2007-08-27T08:42:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	nosklo	anything equivalent to writing a slackbuild or running checkinstall in slackware?
2007-08-27T08:42:00.000Z	nosklo	jacquesmerde	a .deb is just an archive with lots of files inside and a policy... if you plan to make *compliant* .deb packages you must follow the packaging guidelines.... that can be hard depending on the source organization
2007-08-27T08:43:00.000Z	nosklo	jacquesmerde	you have checkinstall in ubuntu but that doesn't make a *compliant* package
2007-08-27T08:43:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	nosklo	the only reason i want a .deb is so i can uninstall it, deleting files, fixing made symlinks, backing up conf files, etc..
2007-08-27T08:44:00.000Z	jacquesmerde		what's a "compliant" package?
2007-08-27T08:45:00.000Z	nosklo	jacquesmerde	checkinstall will do a trick, but maybe it is better to learn how to package properly so you can provide updates easily, upgrades won't destroy configuration, and you can distribute easily the software, even on ubuntu if it is free...
2007-08-27T08:45:00.000Z	nosklo	jacquesmerde	to make a compkiant package look at the Packaging Guide: http://doc.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/packagingguide/
2007-08-27T08:46:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	nosklo	oh, these debs are only for my own personal use
2007-08-27T08:47:00.000Z	nosklo	jacquesmerde	I am still inclined to learn how to make everything *the rigth way* even for my own use... I never know, I may purchase another machine, may use my package on one of my clients later... and that knowledge will prove useful...
2007-08-27T08:48:00.000Z	nosklo	jacquesmerde	but you may do as you see fit,. you may as well just zip the files for your application and you wont even need .deb.... just unzip to a folder into, say, /usr/local and you're done installing
2007-08-27T08:49:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	nosklo	as in ./configure && make && tar?
2007-08-27T08:49:00.000Z	nosklo	jacquesmerde	or use checkinstall which is almost the same thing
2007-08-27T08:50:00.000Z	nosklo	jacquesmerde	but by making a proper package you can specify dependencies and have them installed automatically next time, you can use debconf to configure your package, etc etc
2007-08-27T08:51:00.000Z	jacquesmerde	nosklo	i always made packages the proper way with archlinux, setting dependencies, and stuff like that. with arch it was a breeze even for me. but i'm guessing with ubuntu i won't have that much control over my system
2007-08-27T08:52:00.000Z	nosklo	jacquesmerde	that would be your choice, you may have as much control as you need/want to
