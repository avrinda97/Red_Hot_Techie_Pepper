2011-12-29T00:59:00.000Z	VCoolio	fivedaysahead	can't, why would you?
2011-12-29T00:59:00.000Z	VCoolio	fivedaysahead	6 virtuel consoles is plenty, then one display server, maybe two, that's is, not?
2011-12-29T01:00:00.000Z	fivedaysahead	VCoolio	it is but is it possible to go above 6 i mean startx can make more than 6 so why would you not be able to access them?
2011-12-29T01:01:00.000Z	VCoolio	fivedaysahead	I guess someone thought of a workaround / possibility, it's linux after all, but I don't know of it
