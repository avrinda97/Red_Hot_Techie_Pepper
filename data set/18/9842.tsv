2007-09-26T16:48:00.000Z	alex-weej	blue|palm	the GNOME release notes have about 3 different font configurations
2007-09-26T16:49:00.000Z	alex-weej		FreeSans autohinted
2007-09-26T16:49:00.000Z	alex-weej		at 8pt
2007-09-26T16:49:00.000Z	alex-weej		DejaVu Sans bytecode hinted 8pt
2007-09-26T16:49:00.000Z	blue|palm	alex-weej	sorry thats true... which is the topmost (first) screenshot?
2007-09-26T16:50:00.000Z	alex-weej	blue|palm	you are aware that it is scaled down, right? :P
2007-09-26T16:50:00.000Z	blue|palm	alex-weej	yeah... im just trying to familiarise myself with these fonts... (mine look terrible at present)
2007-09-26T16:50:00.000Z	alex-weej	blue|palm	give me a screenshot
2007-09-26T16:51:00.000Z	blue|palm	alex-weej	http://www.gnome.org/start/2.20/notes/en/figures/rndevelopers-library-gnome-org.png is the one im most interested in... what is the font in the browser?
2007-09-26T16:51:00.000Z	alex-weej	blue|palm	you're seeing a bug in Firefox where it refuses to use the bytecode hinter
2007-09-26T16:52:00.000Z	alex-weej	blue|palm	open a console and type "sudo dpkg-reconfigure fontconfig-config"
2007-09-26T16:52:00.000Z	alex-weej	blue|palm	you will get a debconf wizard, make sure you choose either "autohinted" or "None" for the hinting type
2007-09-26T16:52:00.000Z	alex-weej	blue|palm	now log out and back in again
2007-09-26T16:53:00.000Z	blue|palm	alex-weej	thanks

2007-09-26T16:56:00.000Z	alex-weej	blue|palm	DejaVu Sans (the default Sans font) with full autohinting i think
