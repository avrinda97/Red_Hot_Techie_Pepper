2010-05-30T14:13:00.000Z	Semperfi40		Oh alright
2010-05-30T14:13:00.000Z	Semperfi40		Thats probably bad for troubleshooting or anything that may happen down the road
2010-05-30T14:14:00.000Z	Semperfi40		also make sure you reset your internet connection source directly as well
2010-05-30T14:15:00.000Z	Semperfi40		Ok ok guys sorry for all the beatin' round the bush I just have to make sure I'm doing everything right. I hate screwing up and having to RE-INSTALL EVERYTHING >.>
2010-05-30T14:16:00.000Z	Semperfi40		Btw no one told me what "LTS" stands for
2010-05-30T14:16:00.000Z	Semperfi40		Ohh
2010-05-30T14:16:00.000Z	Semperfi40		Oh...
2010-05-30T14:16:00.000Z	Semperfi40		Has there not normally been support in the past?
2010-05-30T14:17:00.000Z	Semperfi40		Soo this isn't a regular release? It's a special release? But it is the most UP TO DATE verison of Ubuntu? They just decided to make it an LTS release this time?
2010-05-30T14:18:00.000Z	Semperfi40		Or is it sort of like Microsoft and their 4 year release timeline
