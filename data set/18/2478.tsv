2010-05-07T00:30:00.000Z	Jasongk123		does anybody have a problem with disabled networking after failed suspend?
2010-05-07T00:30:00.000Z	Jasongk123		it just shows "Networking disabled"
2010-05-07T00:30:00.000Z	Jasongk123		i mean the applet shows me that message
2010-05-07T00:31:00.000Z	GeekSquid	Jasongk123	common problem, sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart after resume
2010-05-07T00:31:00.000Z	Jasongk123	GeekSquid	will try that
2010-05-07T00:33:00.000Z	Jasongk123	GeekSquid	did not help :(
2010-05-07T00:33:00.000Z	GeekSquid	Jasongk123	how about sudo /etc/init.d/networking start
2010-05-07T00:34:00.000Z	Jasongk123	GeekSquid	oh an i have 10.04
2010-05-07T00:35:00.000Z	Jasongk123	GeekSquid	nope... not even that
2010-05-07T00:35:00.000Z	Jasongk123	GeekSquid	running services networking start gives me an error too
2010-05-07T00:36:00.000Z	GeekSquid	Jasongk123	I'm stumped
2010-05-07T00:36:00.000Z	Jasongk123	GeekSquid	me too...
2010-05-07T00:55:00.000Z	GeekSquid	Jasongk123	really nothing, I have that yet my network is running and working
2010-05-07T00:55:00.000Z	Jasongk123	GeekSquid	then i gues i have to reinstall ubuntu :(
2010-05-07T00:56:00.000Z	GeekSquid	Jasongk123	uh, you said you had problems after suspend, does a reboot help
2010-05-07T00:57:00.000Z	Jasongk123	GeekSquid	nope... restart does not help... and not even windows is booting now
2010-05-07T00:57:00.000Z	Jasongk123	GeekSquid	not even pulling the battery for 2 hours helps
