2007-05-24T06:40:00.000Z	zcutlip|laptop	mh_le	you'll want to make sure you create users with the same usernames/uids as before, so their homdirs and ownership will match up
2007-05-24T06:41:00.000Z	mh_le	zcutlip|laptop	can I copy the password file from my old install?
2007-05-24T06:42:00.000Z	zcutlip|laptop	mh_le	hmm.... haven't tried that... i wouldn't expect it to work.  at the very lest you'd need /etc/passwd /etc/shadow, /etc/group
2007-05-24T06:43:00.000Z	zcutlip|laptop	mh_le	do you have a lot of users?  if not, you could just recreate them manually
2007-05-24T06:44:00.000Z	mh_le	zcutlip|laptop	well I only have a few but I don't know their passwords
2007-05-24T06:46:00.000Z	zcutlip|laptop	mh_le	but you'll need all 3.
2007-05-24T06:48:00.000Z	mh_le	zcutlip|laptop	okay cool
2007-05-24T06:48:00.000Z	zcutlip|laptop	mh_le	g/l
2007-05-24T06:49:00.000Z	mh_le	zcutlip|laptop	g/l?
2007-05-24T06:49:00.000Z	zcutlip|laptop	mh_le	"g/l" == "good luck"
2007-05-24T06:50:00.000Z	mh_le	zcutlip|laptop	thanks... I have one more question, does ubuntu server come with X?
2007-05-24T06:50:00.000Z	zcutlip|laptop	mh_le	doesn't install X out of box, but you can apt-get install anything
2007-05-24T06:51:00.000Z	mh_le	zcutlip|laptop	so apt-get install x.org and all is installed?
2007-05-24T06:51:00.000Z	zcutlip|laptop	mh_le	not sure.... you'll probably need a bit more than that
2007-05-24T06:52:00.000Z	zcutlip|laptop	mh_le	someone mentioned earlier a guide for running the server install with a gui.  not sure which package/packages you need to get a minimal gui
2007-05-24T06:52:00.000Z	mh_le	zcutlip|laptop	ah okay
2007-05-24T06:53:00.000Z	zcutlip|laptop	mh_le	maybe ask google "ubuntu server gui"?  also check the wiki, and possibly howtoforge
2007-05-24T06:53:00.000Z	mh_le	zcutlip|laptop	will du
