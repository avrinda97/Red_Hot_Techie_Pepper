2011-04-30T14:54:00.000Z	Mrokii		Hello. I have upgraded to 11.04 and wanted to see if the nvidia-drivers are installed. Turns out they are "active" but not "in use". How can I actually use them?
2011-04-30T14:55:00.000Z	Incarus6	Mrokii	enable them in "jockey"
2011-04-30T14:55:00.000Z	Mrokii	Incarus6	erm... what is jokey?
2011-04-30T14:56:00.000Z	Incarus6	Mrokii	type it in the application search form, it will be shown up as "hardware drivers" or something
2011-04-30T14:56:00.000Z	Mrokii	Incarus6	ah, okay, but that is what I had already opened (looking for "driver"). The problem is: There is no activate button anywhere.
2011-04-30T14:57:00.000Z	Incarus6	Mrokii	but the driver is listed in the list in that application?
2011-04-30T14:58:00.000Z	Mrokii	Incarus6	yes, and at the bottom of the window is this: "This driver is activated but not currently in use." Does that mean I need to do a restart to activate it?
2011-04-30T15:06:00.000Z	Mrokii	Incarus6	I have found something on the net. Will try a restart.
2011-04-30T15:11:00.000Z	Mrokii	Incarus6	Still no success. Do you have any ideas on how I can use the nvidia-drivers?
2011-04-30T15:11:00.000Z	Incarus6	Mrokii	paste "glxinfo"
2011-04-30T15:13:00.000Z	Mrokii	Incarus6	one moment, trying something. Maybe I need to do another restart. If so, I will paste the output from glxinfo afterwards.
2011-04-30T15:24:00.000Z	Mrokii	Incarus6	This is the output from glxinfo: http://pastebin.com/Hs8x8WB8
2011-04-30T15:33:00.000Z	Mrokii	Incarus6	If I look at that glxinfo-output it looks to me as if the nvidia-drivers are installed. What do you think?
2011-04-30T15:33:00.000Z	Incarus6	Mrokii	whats the exact problem you got atm? Unity isn't working, right?
2011-04-30T15:35:00.000Z	Mrokii	Incarus6	Nope, it seems that Unity is working. At least I got that dock-like thing on the left and I can search for items. My sole problem is that the hardware-drivers-app tells me that the nvidia-drivers aren't used. Though I am able to start a game that uses a 3D-environment, if that is anything to judge from. Basically all I want is to make sure that the nvidia-drivers are installed.
2011-04-30T15:36:00.000Z	Incarus6	Mrokii	could be a wrong error, are all 3D things like games still working?
2011-04-30T15:38:00.000Z	Mrokii	Incarus6	I only have this one game (Planeshift) which was only usable on 10.10 with nvidia-drivers installed. And yes, as far as I can tell, all works. I was just confused about the message shown by the hardware-driver-app, telling me that the drivers aren't used. But from the impression I got (the game works flawless) it seems they *are* installed. Just confusing.
2011-07-29T16:43:00.000Z	Mrokii	Incarus6	Thanks, I'll look into that.
