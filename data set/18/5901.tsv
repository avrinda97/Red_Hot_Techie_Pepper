2008-08-04T14:18:00.000Z	lucas2	DozedOnLinux	I found the device in lshw.  there is no driver= entry in the configuration line however.
2008-08-04T14:19:00.000Z	DozedOnLinux		﻿﻿lucas2:   then check in terminal (to see which is aliased) > cat /etc/modprobe.d/aliases
2008-08-04T14:20:00.000Z	lucas2		DozenOnLinux: not sure what to look for in that file.  I don't see anything stand out that looks related to wireless network.
2008-08-04T14:21:00.000Z	DozedOnLinux		﻿lucas2:  i have seen that issue before somewhere in the forums, i just need to recall where
2008-08-04T14:21:00.000Z	DozedOnLinux		﻿lucas2: maybe search forums

2008-08-04T14:31:00.000Z	DozedOnLinux	lucas2	that is just to give you an idea, please dont take that as a fix. you need to know what card is what first

2008-08-04T14:33:00.000Z	DozedOnLinux		﻿ ﻿lucas2: tell me when you are done reviewing and maybe i can help you out from there, if not, someone else in here prob can
2008-08-04T14:34:00.000Z	lucas2	DozedOnLinux	it looks like the ubuntu wireless guide had the missing link.  it mentinos a few drivers to blacklist.  on a first inspection that seemed to have worked.
2008-08-04T14:34:00.000Z	DozedOnLinux		oy yes
2008-08-04T14:34:00.000Z	DozedOnLinux		﻿ ﻿lucas2: in terminal > cat /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist
2008-08-04T14:35:00.000Z	lucas2	DozedOnLinux	I added 4 drivers to that file just a minute ago.
