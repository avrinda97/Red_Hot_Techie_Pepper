2007-02-24T08:19:00.000Z	charles		any network experts here? I'm having a hell of a time setting up my gateway
2007-02-24T08:19:00.000Z	aSt3raL	charles	whats the problem?
2007-02-24T08:20:00.000Z	aSt3raL	charles	what sort of internet connection?
2007-02-24T08:21:00.000Z	aSt3raL	charles	do you have any other machine working with this connection?
2007-02-24T08:23:00.000Z	charles	aSt3raL	yeah I'm connected through the machine right now
2007-02-24T08:23:00.000Z	aSt3raL	charles	with ubuntu?
2007-02-24T08:24:00.000Z	aSt3raL	charles	whats the problem then?
2007-02-24T08:24:00.000Z	charles	aSt3raL	right now I'm connected through a nat'd machine. the other machine wont connect
2007-02-24T08:24:00.000Z	charles	aSt3raL	the two machines behind the gateway are ubuntu, the gateway itself is debian
2007-02-24T08:25:00.000Z	aSt3raL	charles	so one machine works and the other doesnt?
2007-02-24T08:25:00.000Z	aSt3raL	charles	can you ask a more specific question?
2007-02-24T08:26:00.000Z	charles	aSt3raL	I can get out from both machines, I can get in to the nat'd machine through port forwarding, I can't get to the public machine from the oustide
2007-02-24T08:26:00.000Z	aSt3raL	charles	you probably have to set up port forwarding to get into a machine from the internet for all machines
2007-02-24T08:27:00.000Z	aSt3raL	charles	your dsl router has the only public ip address
2007-02-24T08:27:00.000Z	charles	aSt3raL	the other machine has it's own IP, so it should have it's own ports
2007-02-24T08:27:00.000Z	aSt3raL	charles	what ip address is that?
2007-02-24T08:27:00.000Z	charles	aSt3raL	i own a block of 8 ips
2007-02-24T08:28:00.000Z	charles	aSt3raL	my network's gateway is 65.101.241.134, my personal gateway is 65.101.241.129, the other public ip is 65.101.241.1332
