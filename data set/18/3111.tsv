2009-12-12T19:31:00.000Z	znrf		hi, does someone know how to tell firefox to use nautilus when uploading a file ?
2009-12-12T19:32:00.000Z	znrf		i mean, to open nautilus to search a file to upload instead of the default firefox file explorer who don't have true thumblnails
2009-12-12T19:34:00.000Z	llutz	znrf	get firefox-source, change it, compile it, use it
2009-12-12T19:35:00.000Z	znrf	llutz	ok, but are you sure it's possible to do that modifing the firefox source code ?
2009-12-12T19:38:00.000Z	znrf	llutz	i downloaded firefox source code usin apt-get source firefox, but can't figure out where i must place "nautilus"
2009-12-12T19:38:00.000Z	llutz	znrf	it's up to you to find it out
2009-12-12T19:38:00.000Z	znrf	llutz	but are you sure it's possible to do ?
2009-12-12T19:38:00.000Z	llutz	znrf	since its all only software, yes
2009-12-12T19:39:00.000Z	llutz	znrf	it makes no sense, but try it
2009-12-12T19:39:00.000Z	znrf	llutz	why it makes no sense ?
2009-12-12T19:40:00.000Z	znrf	llutz	i need to have thumnails cause i work a lot with pictures
2009-12-12T19:40:00.000Z	llutz	znrf	you want to replace a fileselect-dialog with an application.... senseless
2009-12-12T19:40:00.000Z	znrf	llutz	i need to upload a lot of pictures all the day, but firefox don't show thumbnails
2009-12-12T19:40:00.000Z	znrf	llutz	but fileselect-dialog do not provide thumbnail view
2009-12-12T19:41:00.000Z	llutz	znrf	change it if you need/want it
2009-12-12T19:43:00.000Z	znrf	llutz	is it the nsFilePicker.cpp file i must change ?
2009-12-12T19:43:00.000Z	llutz	znrf	dunno
