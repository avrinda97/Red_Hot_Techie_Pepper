2008-02-03T21:58:00.000Z	linux__alien		Hi people i ve a Dell Inspiron 1520 Laptop and i ve installed 7.10 in it . Now i tried configuring Wireless In Ubuntu. I ve a NetGear Wireless Router Installed .I ve password Enabled in it to avoid other people using it but what happens is that i am not able to connect to the wireless network though Ubuntu recognizes the router . I am able to do the same using Ubuntu to an other Network which does not have password enabled . can someone help me please ?
2008-02-03T21:59:00.000Z	linux__alien		I am desparately in need of the connection
2008-02-03T21:59:00.000Z	Randomtime	linux__alien	WPA or WEP
2008-02-03T21:59:00.000Z	linux__alien	Randomtime	I ve given the password type as WEP
2008-02-03T22:00:00.000Z	linux__alien	Randomtime	How do i rectify it
2008-02-03T22:00:00.000Z	Randomtime		linux___alien: well, it isn't a driver issue, try switchign to WPA on the router (more secure) and see if that works
2008-02-03T22:01:00.000Z	linux__alien	Randomtime	In Ubuntu i gave the WEP key the 13 Digit Key as input. Thats right?
2008-02-03T22:02:00.000Z	linux__alien		I tried both the Ascii option and the hexadecimal option too
2008-02-03T22:02:00.000Z	Randomtime	linux__alien	Wep should be hex paris
2008-02-03T22:02:00.000Z	Randomtime		*pairs
2008-02-03T22:02:00.000Z	Randomtime	linux__alien	WEP is totaly broken anyway
2008-02-03T22:03:00.000Z	linux__alien	Randomtime	I should give the key only right and not the PassPhrase right/
2008-02-03T22:03:00.000Z	linux__alien		?
2008-02-03T22:03:00.000Z	Randomtime	linux__alien	WEP is key based, shoud be 12 hex digit pairs
2008-02-03T22:03:00.000Z	Randomtime	linux__alien	sorry 123
2008-02-03T22:04:00.000Z	Randomtime	linux__alien	sorry 13 i'll get it right one day
2008-02-03T22:04:00.000Z	linux__alien	Randomtime	Ok So is there any other way that i could resolve it ?
2008-02-03T22:04:00.000Z	Randomtime	linux__alien	Try removing security from your router, just for the moment
