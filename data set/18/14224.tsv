2006-05-14T08:44:00.000Z	intelikey	Kyral	 i've read that,  there is no mention of using root on hd?    i'm asking if it is a known issue with grub or not, that grub cant install without a partition table ?

2006-05-14T08:46:00.000Z	Kyral	intelikey	if there is no partition, then where the HELL is the kernel
