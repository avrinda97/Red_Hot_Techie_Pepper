2008-10-26T07:36:00.000Z	Shakedown		So after reading the man pages I'm still not clear on what the difference between 'sudo apt-get clean' and 'sudo apt-get autoclean' is. Which should I use?
2008-10-26T07:37:00.000Z	Shakedown		Thanks CjMaster
2008-10-26T07:39:00.000Z	Shakedown		Are there some standard steps an Ubuntu user can take to keep the installation clean? Such things like 'sudo apt-get autoclean'
2008-10-26T07:40:00.000Z	Shakedown		Autoclean? That's all I need to periodically do?
2008-10-26T07:41:00.000Z	favro	Shakedown	I always use sudo apt-get --purge autoclean/remove
2008-10-26T07:41:00.000Z	Shakedown		Hmm...thanks for the replies

2008-10-26T07:55:00.000Z	Shakedown		So if I'm on www.gnome-look.org and I want a new login screen, I want to look at GDM Themes, right?
2008-10-26T07:55:00.000Z	favro	Shakedown	what's happenning/not happening with gdm?
2008-10-26T07:55:00.000Z	favro		k
