2010-04-30T17:29:00.000Z	mrsun		everything in ubuntu has been realy simple, until this....
2010-04-30T17:29:00.000Z	mrsun		in 9.10 aprently you have a "preferences->hardware" thingie you can change it in
2010-04-30T17:29:00.000Z	mrsun		but aparently not in lucid for some reason ?
2010-04-30T17:31:00.000Z	mrsun		and aparently i cant get any help here either :(
2010-04-30T17:31:00.000Z	mrsun		sigh
2010-04-30T17:31:00.000Z	dabaR	mrsun	and you're in a bit of a rush to get 6 channel sound, I see. :-P
2010-04-30T17:31:00.000Z	mrsun	dabaR	only thing left to configure
2010-04-30T17:32:00.000Z	dabaR	mrsun	well, leave it for tomorrow. Or just be patient and ask every half hour here, or 10 minutes
2010-04-30T17:32:00.000Z	dabaR	mrsun	and compose a good question, while you are waiting. Detail specs, steps tried, link to tutorial you are following, etc.
2010-04-30T17:33:00.000Z	mrsun	dabaR	but now im just asking "where has the preferences->hardware" configuration tool gone
2010-04-30T17:34:00.000Z	dabaR	mrsun	I can think of a way... where was it before?
2010-04-30T17:36:00.000Z	dabaR	mrsun	you tried the sounds preferences, of course?
2010-04-30T17:36:00.000Z	mrsun	dabaR	yes and i can do nothing in it
