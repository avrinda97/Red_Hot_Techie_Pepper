2005-06-26T08:28:00.000Z	Mez		have you tried gparted ?
2005-06-26T08:29:00.000Z	kangpeh	Mez	 Would I lose data when using gparted?
2005-06-26T08:30:00.000Z	Mez	kangpeh	I'm not too sure - I've not t4ried it myself, but apparentyly it's simolar tpo partition magic
2005-06-26T08:30:00.000Z	kangpeh	Mez	 Ah, I see - thanks ;)
2005-06-26T08:30:00.000Z	Mez		and tchmnky - ah well.... Im stumped on that one then... mine works properl
2005-06-26T08:30:00.000Z	kangpeh		I'll see how it works, Mez - and let you know ;)
2005-06-26T08:30:00.000Z	kangpeh		ah it only supports reiser3
2005-06-26T08:31:00.000Z	Mez		most likely load and bomb out
2005-06-26T08:35:00.000Z	kangpeh		Mez
2005-06-26T08:35:00.000Z	kangpeh		i guess the only way
2005-06-26T08:35:00.000Z	kangpeh		is to start over
2005-06-26T08:35:00.000Z	kangpeh		from scratch huh?
2005-06-26T08:35:00.000Z	Mez		have a look at
2005-06-26T08:35:00.000Z	Mez		https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats
2005-06-26T08:36:00.000Z	kangpeh		Mez?
2005-06-26T08:36:00.000Z	kangpeh	Mez	 gparted didn't seem to have the ability to modify my filesystems.
2005-06-26T08:37:00.000Z	Mez		ah - lol - fair enough - it doesnt mine either... I dunno whether it needs some sort of extra lib or somehting
2005-06-26T08:37:00.000Z	kangpeh	Mez	 I guess the only way I can do so is to start over T_T
