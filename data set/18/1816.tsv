2010-11-04T16:59:00.000Z	mac_nibblet		Anyone here know howto force a resolution on a external screen from a laptop?
2010-11-04T16:59:00.000Z	mrnelson1986	mac_nibblet	what video card do you have
2010-11-04T16:59:00.000Z	mac_nibblet	mrnelson1986	 nvidia 9600m gt
2010-11-04T17:00:00.000Z	mrnelson1986	mac_nibblet	under "preferences" do you have "NVIDIA X SERVER SETTINGS"?
2010-11-04T17:00:00.000Z	mac_nibblet		yea
2010-11-04T17:00:00.000Z	mac_nibblet		but i only get 1920x420
2010-11-04T17:00:00.000Z	mac_nibblet		i want 3840x1080
2010-11-04T17:01:00.000Z	mrnelson1986	mac_nibblet	do you choose configure and choose something other than cloning your display? it should let you change to its own X
2010-11-04T17:01:00.000Z	mrnelson1986		which may enable different resolutions
2010-11-04T17:02:00.000Z	mac_nibblet	mrnelson1986	im using a Matrox triplehead2go
2010-11-04T17:02:00.000Z	mac_nibblet		whitch is returning a invalid edid
2010-11-04T17:02:00.000Z	mrnelson1986	mac_nibblet	i'm not sure what that is
2010-11-04T17:04:00.000Z	mrnelson1986	mac_nibblet	you can't choose "advanced" and force the resolution? I can edit manually my laptop resolution
2010-11-04T17:04:00.000Z	mrnelson1986	mac_nibblet	(not hooked up to an external atm, so i can't test that)
2010-11-04T17:04:00.000Z	mac_nibblet	mrnelson1986	you can change your panning not your resolution
2010-11-04T17:04:00.000Z	mac_nibblet		thats two different things
2010-11-04T17:05:00.000Z	mrnelson1986	mac_nibblet	my fault I just glanced over the setting
2010-11-04T17:06:00.000Z	mrnelson1986	mac_nibblet	only other idea I have is try different drivers...i've gotta go though at work
