2009-12-08T05:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	fluffy	sure you can
2009-12-08T05:09:00.000Z	fluffy	ActionParsnip	really? how? i didnt see an option
2009-12-08T05:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	fluffy	unlike a windows install, if you actually watch and read the screen you wil benefit
2009-12-08T05:09:00.000Z	fluffy	ActionParsnip	i watched the whole thing
2009-12-08T05:10:00.000Z	fluffy	ActionParsnip	until the part where it hung, then i left for 1/2 an hour, came back in same place
2009-12-08T05:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	fluffy	you can ski the step
2009-12-08T05:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	fluffy	just watch the screen
2009-12-08T05:11:00.000Z	fluffy	ActionParsnip	okay, i see a window taht says installing laguage packs, a bar at 95%, and then a little pane with "getting help with ubuntu"
2009-12-08T05:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	fluffy	no, before that happens you are given the option to skip the step
2009-12-08T05:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	fluffy	now you are in te stage, you cant back out
2009-12-08T05:12:00.000Z	fluffy	ActionParsnip	if i reinstall, itll make another partition, right?
