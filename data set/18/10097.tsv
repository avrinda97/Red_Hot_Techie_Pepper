2007-01-19T07:41:00.000Z	kuma	Murchadh	no, it's copying alright, just showing that error message of "failing to keep propietary from (/home/ file location)"
2007-01-19T07:43:00.000Z	Murchadh	kuma	Yeah, the above changes permissions to allow full read/write access to all users, which would mean you wouldn't need sudo for copy/move! Also, might get rid of that error as a bonus.
2007-01-19T07:45:00.000Z	kuma	Murchadh	, ok, i'll do that. I'm trying to use that partition as Data storage for Win and Linux, do you have any tips for this?
2007-01-19T07:47:00.000Z	kuma	Murchadh	sudo umount /mount/point_of_vfat_device? Isn't that the /dev/ directory (i'm using Kubuntu)
2007-01-19T07:47:00.000Z	Murchadh	kuma	I have a similar situation where I've added umask=000 to the options section for all vfat drives in the /etc/fstab file. Edit /etc/fstab as root and add that.
2007-01-19T07:48:00.000Z	kuma	Murchadh	ok, one at the time xD, first i'll umount and mount the fat partition
2007-01-19T07:48:00.000Z	Murchadh	kuma	Likely to be /media/?d? similar to whatever device it is /dev/?d?
2007-01-19T07:48:00.000Z	kuma	Murchadh	ok, i'll use the /media/ dir then
2007-01-19T07:49:00.000Z	Murchadh	kuma	You can mount and umount drives in the /etc/fstab file by giving either the devices name (/dev/?d?) or the mount point (/media/?d?).
2007-01-19T07:50:00.000Z	kuma	Murchadh	hmmm, please give me detailed instructions, i tried to umount the fat partition but it says "busy dispositive"
2007-01-19T07:55:00.000Z	Murchadh	kuma	I think something is accessing the drive so it may be difficult to umount. You could add the umask=000 to the /etc/fstab and it will be active on next reboot!
2007-01-19T07:56:00.000Z	kuma	Murchadh	ok, i'll do that
2007-01-19T07:58:00.000Z	kuma	Murchadh	current umask=0007 changing it to 000
2007-01-19T08:00:00.000Z	kuma	Murchadh	hope it works, thanks for your help :)
2007-01-19T08:00:00.000Z	Murchadh	kuma	Yeah! And if you can't find what's using that partition you could reboot, and see if it all works a little easier! You may want to check out the security implications of this. yvw
2007-01-19T08:01:00.000Z	kuma	Murchadh	Well, since it's a home computer i wouldn't worry about security, at least you mean security in a network enviroment
2007-01-19T08:03:00.000Z	Murchadh	kuma	Yeah! My own environment is slightly larger involving a wan but there is nothing of a secret or private nature on these drives so I don't worry about it and use this umask for all ntfs and vfat drives. Hope it all works out for you too!
