2008-12-25T15:48:00.000Z	benjamin1		I've got a problem with my firefox. it doesn't load all the pics of a website sometimes. f.e amazon.com
2008-12-25T15:48:00.000Z	benjamin1		firefox 3.05
2008-12-25T15:49:00.000Z	benjamin1		6000dsl, 2500 possible connections per minute, 512kbit upload, tested on speed.io
2008-12-25T15:49:00.000Z	benjamin1		i think its a tcp/ip-setting
2008-12-25T15:49:00.000Z	benjamin1		under windows i would kow how to configure it, but on ubuntu its another story
2008-12-25T15:51:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	benjamin1	it's also possible for router problems/outages between you and the websites these images come from
2008-12-25T15:51:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	benjamin1	and possible problems with the server these images are served from
2008-12-25T15:52:00.000Z	benjamin1	onetinsoldier	maybe, but i've got the problem since i use ubuntu. for 2 weeks...
2008-12-25T15:52:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	benjamin1	roger. i doubt it's firefox itself though.
2008-12-25T15:53:00.000Z	benjamin1	onetinsoldier	yeah me 2. i think it got something with the inetconnectionsettings in ubuntu to do...
2008-12-25T15:54:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	benjamin1	oh, i see. hmmm
2008-12-25T15:55:00.000Z	benjamin1	onetinsoldier	can u test this url for me? http://www.amazon.de/Sonderangebote-Restposten-Schn%C3%A4ppchen-Shop-%C3%9Cberblick/b/ref=amb_link_82762593_1?ie=UTF8&node=872398&pf_rd_m=A3JWKAKR8XB7XF&pf_rd_s=center-1&pf_rd_r=11J7WPR4FWE9ZYBKMDGH&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=464818473&pf_rd_i=301128

2008-12-25T16:01:00.000Z	benjamin1	onetinsoldier	IntuitiveNipple thinks its an transparent proxy-prob of mine
