2006-07-25T16:43:00.000Z	`Evil`		enverex, I'm actually getting a kick out of watching XP install in Linux    LOL   Geek XD
2006-07-25T16:45:00.000Z	Vratha	`Evil`	install in linux via vmware?
2006-07-25T16:46:00.000Z	`Evil`	Vratha	QEMU, dont have much experience, just trying it out cos of some progs I need to run
2006-07-25T16:46:00.000Z	Vratha	`Evil`	ah, ok.. vmware is a better solution though
2006-07-25T16:47:00.000Z	`Evil`	Vratha	Dammit. I searched the net and found everyone using qemu, plus isnt vmware commercial?
2006-07-25T16:47:00.000Z	Vratha	`Evil`	yeah, vmware is commercial software, but they just released vmware server for free non-commercial use
2006-07-25T16:49:00.000Z	`Evil`	Vratha	Oh. So what would you suggest for the best emulation and performance? qemu, vmware, some planner (heard) etc? Cos XP is still installing the files before the GUI mode, so I can still delete the image
2006-07-25T16:49:00.000Z	Vratha	`Evil`	i suggest vmware for the best performance; it's not an emulator even.. it's a full blown virtual machine
2006-07-25T16:50:00.000Z	Vratha	`Evil`	though it does capture hardware calls and provides interfaces for things like the AMD lance network card, etc... pretty crappy hardware overall
2006-07-25T16:51:00.000Z	`Evil`	Vratha	ah k, leme search some vmware install guide on the net
2006-07-25T16:52:00.000Z	`Evil`	Vratha	now that you mentioned Intel, I have AMD 64, it matters?
2006-07-25T16:53:00.000Z	Vratha	`Evil`	you probably have AMD's virtualization hardware then... but even if you don't, it'll still run fast
2006-07-25T16:53:00.000Z	`Evil`	Vratha	kqemu? Wasnt that KDE's version of qemu (i think) or is it different?
2006-07-25T16:53:00.000Z	Vratha	`Evil`	no, kqemu is some proprietary app made by some guy... i'd just go with vmware
2006-07-25T16:54:00.000Z	`Evil`	Vratha	k
2006-07-25T16:57:00.000Z	`Evil`	Vratha	this install is taking a Lot of time, can I close the window or anyother way?
2006-07-25T16:57:00.000Z	Vratha	`Evil`	i don't recall the install taking long :-/
2006-07-25T16:58:00.000Z	`Evil`	Vratha	It got stuck i think at Installing Devices part, maybe it freezed
