2006-03-08T07:22:00.000Z	soundray	dli	I doubt it. hsfmodem is closed afaik.
2006-03-08T07:23:00.000Z	dli	soundray	a firmware is also closed :(
2006-03-08T07:24:00.000Z	dli	soundray	just consider, if the user has to download the network driver (modem, or nic), how stupid is this?
2006-03-08T07:25:00.000Z	soundray	dli	tell Intel, or whoever holds the rights to the modem firm-/software.
2006-03-08T07:26:00.000Z	dli	soundray	I just mean, if there are available firmware or binary drivers, just include them in the installation disk
2006-03-08T07:29:00.000Z	soundray	dli	if gentoo distributes hsfmodem, it doesn't necessarily follow that ubuntu can, too.
2006-03-08T07:32:00.000Z	soundray	dli	do hsfmodem copyright holders explicitly allow redistribution?
2006-03-08T07:33:00.000Z	dli	soundray	I know in gentoo, there's no download restriction, and it downloads from a gentoo mirror
2006-03-08T07:34:00.000Z	soundray	dli	that doesn't answer the question. I don't mean that you have to look it up, but the argument is moot until you know exactly what the redistribution policy is.
2006-03-08T07:34:00.000Z	dli	soundray	I checked the license, it's okay to redistribute the free version
2006-03-08T07:34:00.000Z	dli	soundray	Redistribution. Redistribution of this software is only permitted for exact copies (without modification) of versions explicitly marked and officially released by Linuxant with the word "free" in their name. Redistribution or disclosure of other versions, derivatives or license key information is expressly prohibited without explicit written approval signed by an authorized Linuxant officer.
2006-03-08T07:36:00.000Z	soundray	dli	excellent. You could file a wishlist bug against the linux-restricted-modules package then.
2006-03-28T10:35:00.000Z	dli	soundray	I think "setup" in grub command line is still recommended over grub --install
2006-05-05T15:02:00.000Z	dli	soundray	any chance for the new winfs ?
2006-05-05T15:08:00.000Z	soundray	dli	winfs will have to be reverse engineered to access it from Linux. Probably a major task, and dangerous, from a legal point of view.
2006-05-05T15:09:00.000Z	dli	soundray	I won't touch it anyway
2006-05-27T14:12:00.000Z	soundray	dli	you can, but don't expect Windows to work after that.
2006-05-27T14:13:00.000Z	dli	soundray	how to get windows work with grub on it? :(
