2007-03-09T07:07:00.000Z	usr13		How can I watch this on my Ubuntu system? http://www.funny-video-stuff.com/viewmovie.php?ad_key=QJJEPLYOBQNF&tracking_id=623004&type=wmv&source=623004&path=/2007/01/24/1/redneckslingshot.wmv
2007-03-09T07:08:00.000Z	Slart	usr13	download it and use vlc player
2007-03-09T07:09:00.000Z	usr13	Slart	I can't figure out where the file is?
2007-03-09T07:09:00.000Z	Slart	usr13	or open vlc and use open file dialog.. and paste the url there
2009-03-11T17:50:00.000Z	usr13	Slart	jaspal4805 Compare to see if you have same wifi cards:  lspci
2009-11-29T00:04:00.000Z	Slart	usr13	8GB is 8*1024*1024*1024 according to everyone else.. the hard drive manufacturers on the other hand say that 8GB is 8 *1000*1000*1000 which is a little less
2009-11-29T00:04:00.000Z	usr13	Slart	Oh, good point.
2010-01-14T23:49:00.000Z	usr13	Slart	Yes, and I often read html pages via lynx from tty Try it, you'll like it.
2010-01-14T23:47:00.000Z	usr13	Slart	Try tty (easier on the eyes)...
2010-01-14T23:48:00.000Z	Slart	usr13	you think a tty is easier to read than a html page?
2010-01-14T23:50:00.000Z	Slart	usr13	I'll give it a try =)
2010-04-29T17:26:00.000Z	usr13	Slart	/var/log/Xorg.0.log
2010-04-29T17:27:00.000Z	usr13	Slart	Correction:  /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2010-04-29T17:27:00.000Z	Slart	usr13	isn't that just for the starting up part of Xorg? would a X server crashing end up in that file?
2010-04-29T17:27:00.000Z	usr13	Slart	Yes it is.
2010-04-29T17:28:00.000Z	usr13	Slart	But what are you looking for?
2010-04-29T17:29:00.000Z	Slart	usr13	some error message from an X server crashing ( peter_curry is the one with the naughty X server)
2010-04-29T17:29:00.000Z	Slart	usr13	but there's nothing in syslog or kern.log about it
