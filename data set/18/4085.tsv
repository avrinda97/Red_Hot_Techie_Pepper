2009-06-07T03:23:00.000Z	_2eXtreme		guys can someone give me a tried and tested guide on setting up wireless on jaunty with a broadcom 4306/3 chipset? this is driving me nuts now :(
2009-06-07T03:24:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	_2eXtreme	I thought I used bwcutter on that.
2009-06-07T03:25:00.000Z	_2eXtreme	Jack_Sparrow	I dont know how to get it working. It says wrong input file or something along those lines...
2009-06-07T03:26:00.000Z	_2eXtreme	Jack_Sparrow	theres no doc for jaunty :(
2009-06-07T03:27:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	_2eXtreme	That should still work
2009-06-07T03:27:00.000Z	_2eXtreme	Jack_Sparrow	but older distros of ubuntu supported my wireless better, i didnt need to use bcm cutter
2009-06-07T03:29:00.000Z	_2eXtreme	Jack_Sparrow	are there any tutorials or orum posts that may be of help?

2009-06-07T03:37:00.000Z	_2eXtreme	Jack_Sparrow	Okay, so if I follow these instructions, my card should work, yeah?
2009-06-07T03:37:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	_2eXtreme	It would be what I would try
2009-06-07T03:37:00.000Z	_2eXtreme	Jack_Sparrow	okay, and do i need any sort of pre requisites, any additional software etc?
2009-06-07T03:37:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	_2eXtreme	I have not put any of my bcm4308's on a jaunty box yet
2009-06-07T03:38:00.000Z	_2eXtreme	Jack_Sparrow	do i still need to install ndiswrapper?
2009-06-07T03:39:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	_2eXtreme	I dont think so.  but it has been a long time and I am way tired atm
