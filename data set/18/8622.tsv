2007-07-23T14:06:00.000Z	genefitz		Malik, you houls be able to go to the Compiz site. The installation guide is in wiki form..
2007-07-23T14:07:00.000Z	genefitz		Or for simpler version of Compiz, provided you are using Feisty, you can go into system properties and enable desktop effects, which gives you the cube desktop and "wobble windows"
2007-07-23T14:09:00.000Z	genefitz		Malik, be fair warned, Compiz, depending on your system can be very unstable. Be ready for a crash of X-Org, and maybe the need to reload.
