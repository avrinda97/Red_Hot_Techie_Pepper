2012-06-01T07:02:00.000Z	bluefox83	techquila	i don't have a mouse at the moment...i had to hit ctrl alt f1 to chat here with irssi
2012-06-01T07:04:00.000Z	techquila	bluefox83	i'm having issues upgrading my server to 12.04 with do-release-upgrade ... failing to fetch upgrade tool... wget on the address works though
2012-06-01T07:04:00.000Z	techquila	bluefox83	followed correct upgrade path
2012-06-01T07:04:00.000Z	bluefox83	techquila	does it give any specific error?
2012-06-01T07:05:00.000Z	techquila	bluefox83	tried several... its got me stumped... a lot of people have this error over the years with other releases according to the goog
2012-06-01T07:06:00.000Z	techquila	bluefox83	in fact if memory serves me i've had the same issue several times before with prior upgrades..but i'm buggered if I can remember how i overcame it
2012-06-01T07:09:00.000Z	bluefox83	techquila	i don't recall how to do that...i believe there's a file you need to change that has to do with whether or not to upgrade on releases.
2012-06-01T07:09:00.000Z	techquila	bluefox83	sorry overlooked your last message.. the error is simply this:, and forgive the paste... you mentioned you couldn't follow links:  sod@theta:/var/www$ sudo do-release-upgrade -d
2012-06-01T07:16:00.000Z	techquila	bluefox83	yea i think the file you speak of is the /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades file and the change being to the PROMPT for LTS or NOrmal.. thats unfortunately not the issue here either.  I think i'm gonna have to do a clean install .. i've spent a couple of days trying to get this sorted and i'm just going nowhere... i want to thank you for your assistance though.  :-)
2012-06-01T07:20:00.000Z	bluefox83	techquila	sorry i wasn't more helpful
2012-06-01T07:24:00.000Z	techquila	bluefox83	no worries at all.. can i help you at all?
