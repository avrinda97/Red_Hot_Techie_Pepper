2007-10-11T11:46:00.000Z	fevel		can someone explain to me better about the envy issues?
2007-10-11T11:46:00.000Z	fevel		and why people told me not to use it
2007-10-11T11:46:00.000Z	pete83	fevel	yeah, you have something, and I want it
2007-10-11T11:46:00.000Z	fevel	pete83	lol, you sure know abou envy
2007-10-11T11:47:00.000Z	fevel	pete83	envy is a tool for installing nvidia and ati drivers
2007-10-11T11:48:00.000Z	fevel	pete83	nope, just got ati drivers running yesterday
2007-10-11T11:48:00.000Z	pete83	fevel	which ones?
2007-10-11T11:48:00.000Z	fevel	pete83	although, people seem to be saying that it sucks and I shouldnt use it
2007-10-11T11:49:00.000Z	pete83	fevel	the fglrx 8.41 driver?
2007-10-11T11:50:00.000Z	fevel	pete83	didnt know there was more than one
2007-10-11T11:50:00.000Z	pete83	fevel	I just mean, version 8.42 should probably be out in a week or so (going by their past release schedule), and 8.42 will be the first one with support for AIGLX and desktop effects
2007-10-11T11:51:00.000Z	fevel	pete83	ooooh
2007-10-11T11:51:00.000Z	fevel	pete83	so thats why I couldnt get desktop effects working!
2007-10-11T11:51:00.000Z	fevel	pete83	must be the older one
2007-10-11T11:52:00.000Z	pete83	fevel	Well, it's not out yet, but they promised it would be included this time
2007-10-11T11:52:00.000Z	fevel	pete83	so thats why nvidia is up front when it comes to linux compatability?
2007-10-11T11:56:00.000Z	pete83	fevel	if you're interested in that sort of stuff, the best site for linux video driver reviews and benchmarks seems to be http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=category&item=Graphics
2007-10-11T11:56:00.000Z	fevel	pete83	thank you very much
