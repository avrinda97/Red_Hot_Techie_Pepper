2005-09-12T16:56:00.000Z	selinium		HI there, I have changed my /home directory onto another drive. NOw i am getting gnome.conf errors. Any ideas anyone?
2005-09-12T16:57:00.000Z	disasm	selinium	make sure you dont have anything important, but i'd rm -rf ~/.gnome* personally
2005-09-12T16:58:00.000Z	selinium	disasm	what would that do, and how would i/it recover?
2005-09-12T05:04:00.000Z	disasm	selinium	try chown -R user /home/user where user is you username
2005-09-12T05:04:00.000Z	disasm	selinium	err, sudo that command
2005-09-12T05:04:00.000Z	selinium	disasm	I have chown/chmod -R all ~/
2005-09-12T05:05:00.000Z	disasm	selinium	the only thing i can think of is remove all the gnome settings, rm -rf ~/.gnome* would be the easiest, maybe before doing that create a new user, and see if they have any issues
2005-09-12T05:06:00.000Z	selinium	disasm	I can do that, will gnome reset itself afterwards?
2005-09-12T05:07:00.000Z	disasm	selinium	gnome will set itself up originally like it was when you first installed ubuntu if you remove the settings
2005-09-12T05:08:00.000Z	selinium	disasm	Cheers!
2005-09-12T05:10:00.000Z	selinium	disasm	DO i just restart x or reboot?
2005-09-12T05:10:00.000Z	disasm	selinium	restart X will be fine
2005-09-12T05:11:00.000Z	selinium	disasm	Cheers :)
