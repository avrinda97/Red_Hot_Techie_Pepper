2008-06-16T22:24:00.000Z	soundray	[newb]Miki	it's okay to repeat your question if you've waited this long
2008-06-16T22:50:00.000Z	soundray	[newb]Miki	did you upgrade to hardy, or did you do a fresh install?
2008-06-16T22:51:00.000Z	soundray	[newb]Miki	are any drivers for your video card listed when you open System-Admin-Hardware Drivers ?
2008-06-16T22:51:00.000Z	soundray	[newb]Miki	I replied to you before
2008-06-16T22:52:00.000Z	soundray	[newb]Miki	when you've talked to the channel, you shouldn't look away immediately.
2008-06-16T22:52:00.000Z	soundray	[newb]Miki	now, are any drivers for your video card listed when you open System-Admin-Hardware Drivers ?
2008-06-16T22:53:00.000Z	soundray	[newb]Miki	what is it about your video that isn't working?
2008-06-16T22:54:00.000Z	soundray	[newb]Miki	that's fine for an old laptop.
2008-06-16T22:56:00.000Z	soundray	[newb]Miki	I'm not sure whether the binary ATI driver is compatible with your card, but you could try the factoid:
2008-06-16T22:56:00.000Z	soundray	[newb]Miki	have you also tried envyng?
2008-06-16T22:57:00.000Z	soundray	[newb]Miki	bot not responding atm
2008-06-16T22:57:00.000Z	soundray	[newb]Miki	so it's not like you've been ignored *all* the time
2008-06-16T22:57:00.000Z	soundray	[newb]Miki	envyng, just as I said it
2008-06-16T22:58:00.000Z	soundray	[newb]Miki	envyng-gtk ?
2008-06-25T21:08:00.000Z	soundray	[newb]Miki	spamming won't get you an answer
2008-06-25T21:12:00.000Z	soundray	[newb]Miki	there isn't necessarily a solution for your problem. ATI's Linux driver support has been improving recently, but not so much for older devices. Use the open source driver and get by with the little acceleration that it provides.
2008-06-25T21:13:00.000Z	soundray	[newb]Miki	and, yes, Windows support will definitely be better for your card, because ATI are keeping its internals secret from free software developers.
