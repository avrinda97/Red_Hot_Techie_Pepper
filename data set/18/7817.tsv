2008-02-23T08:56:00.000Z	wease|		alex, lazy and linux =/=
2008-02-23T08:56:00.000Z	alex_	wease|	Well, it's mostly for compiling.  It just seems so tedious.  will you help me do it?
2008-02-23T08:57:00.000Z	wease|	alex_	compiling requires your own intelligence to what you are doing. i cant hold your hand and wait for the outcome only to fix it further. my suggestion is to RTFM
2008-02-23T08:57:00.000Z	alex_	wease|	RTFM?
2008-02-23T08:59:00.000Z	wease|	alex_	you know enough to compile. you chouldnt require me to help you when there is a manual that can help you do the things you want to do.
2008-02-23T08:59:00.000Z	alex_	wease|	Okay, thanks.
2008-02-23T09:05:00.000Z	wease|	alex_	before you attempt to compile you need to know exactly what youre doing and why you are doing it
2008-02-23T09:06:00.000Z	alex_	wease|	Oh, then I suppose I should scratch my "try-random-stuff-in-terminal" plan
2008-02-23T09:07:00.000Z	wease|	alex_	that would be inherently worse, you may as well play roulette with the command line
2008-02-23T09:07:00.000Z	alex_	wease|	I see.  I wasn't really going to type in random stuff, but I don't know how purposeful it would have been :P
2008-02-23T09:08:00.000Z	alex_	wease|	I think I am going to go ahead and give up.  Let me know if you know of any pre-built packages that will edit avi files (add music/transitions/etc.)
2008-02-23T09:09:00.000Z	wease|	alex_	i think Audacity can edit AVIs
2008-02-23T09:10:00.000Z	alex_	wease|	Thanks, I'll check it out.
2008-02-23T09:13:00.000Z	wease|	alex_	i dont think that word means what you think it means
2008-02-23T09:15:00.000Z	alex_	wease|	what compile means?
