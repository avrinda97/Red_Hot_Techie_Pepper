2006-08-22T14:48:00.000Z	eyequeue	frfx2	alternate allows gui installs, server is just server
2006-08-22T14:38:00.000Z	eyequeue	frfx2	the server cd :/  there are three dapper cds per arch
2006-08-22T14:40:00.000Z	eyequeue	frfx2	things have changed sonce breezy days
2006-08-22T14:42:00.000Z	frfx2	eyequeue	if i press "escape" in the install menu, i get "boot:" i can't input "server" or something? :s
2006-08-22T14:42:00.000Z	eyequeue	frfx2	try it if you like
2006-08-22T14:42:00.000Z	eyequeue	frfx2	i think those days have gone
2006-08-22T14:43:00.000Z	eyequeue	frfx2	why not just grab the alternate or server cd for your arch?
2006-08-22T14:43:00.000Z	eyequeue	frfx2	keep in mind the livecd has tons and tons of bytes tied up being the livecd
2006-08-22T14:43:00.000Z	frfx2	eyequeue	but i have an idea! if i install breezy server and i upgrade?
2006-08-22T14:44:00.000Z	eyequeue	frfx2	that would work as well
2006-08-22T14:44:00.000Z	eyequeue	frfx2	fyrestrtr has a good point, a dist-upgrade would be a huge d/l
2006-08-22T14:45:00.000Z	frfx2	eyequeue	i know how to upgrade :) bigger than an 700mb iso?
2006-08-22T14:45:00.000Z	eyequeue	frfx2	obviously it depends how many packages are installed, but i'd say definitely yes
2006-08-22T14:47:00.000Z	frfx2	eyequeue	ok..i will download the alternate..thanks for your help.but you said there were 3cds.which is the 3rd?
2006-08-22T14:47:00.000Z	eyequeue	frfx2	livecd, alternatecd, servercd
2006-08-22T14:47:00.000Z	eyequeue	frfx2	you may want that server :)
2006-08-22T14:48:00.000Z	frfx2	eyequeue	what is difference between alternate and server? alternate is just text mode?
2006-08-22T14:49:00.000Z	eyequeue	frfx2	server might be smaller, i forget
