2007-03-11T11:35:00.000Z	usbdisk		I get a bluescreen on any windows machine (XP or even vista) error in NTFS.sys driver, including the windows boot CDs. I just want to format the OS partition! Someone please help me.
2007-03-11T11:35:00.000Z	slippyr4	usbdisk	? eh?
2007-03-11T11:46:00.000Z	slippyr4	usbdisk	is there anything on the disk you want to keep? or are you just trying to scrap linux and install windows?
2007-03-11T11:48:00.000Z	usbdisk	slippyr4	I wanted to fix windows - a chkdisk or fixmbr should do it but I can't access any of the tools without a crash so now I've given up and decided I want to remove the windows OS partition and reinstall
2007-03-11T11:48:00.000Z	slippyr4	usbdisk	and you have linux on the disk too?
2007-03-11T11:48:00.000Z	slippyr4	usbdisk	which you want to keep?
2007-03-11T11:48:00.000Z	usbdisk	slippyr4	no I'm on a live CD
2007-03-11T11:49:00.000Z	slippyr4	usbdisk	is there *anything* you want to keep on there?
2007-03-11T11:50:00.000Z	slippyr4	usbdisk	by "the whole os" you mean windows? or linux?
2007-03-11T11:50:00.000Z	slippyr4	usbdisk	ok. you have a really easy solution if you're prepared to wipe the disk
2007-03-11T11:51:00.000Z	usbdisk	slippyr4	thanks, someone already said how to do that
2007-03-11T11:51:00.000Z	slippyr4	usbdisk	otherwise, i'd be investigating what is the STOP error you're getting when you try to boot windows/ windows cd. The blue screen will show an 8 digit hex error number, what is that number
2007-03-11T11:52:00.000Z	usbdisk	slippyr4	thanks I'll investigate it
2007-03-11T11:52:00.000Z	slippyr4	usbdisk	tell me that error number
2007-03-11T11:57:00.000Z	slippyr4	usbdisk	you certain that it's stop 0x00000024 ?
2007-03-11T11:58:00.000Z	usbdisk	slippyr4	no but that describes the problem. I'll check and then try this fix if it is: http://www.retosphere.de/tipsandtricks/ntfserror.php?menu_id=24&
2007-03-11T11:58:00.000Z	slippyr4	usbdisk	did you have some bad ram then?
2007-03-11T11:59:00.000Z	usbdisk	slippyr4	I don't know. I was assuming it was the motherboard causing these corruption problems but it might be ram.
