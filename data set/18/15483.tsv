2008-02-03T10:11:00.000Z	voice		thanks dhanar10, but there doesn't seem to be anything on there that helps me
2008-02-03T10:12:00.000Z	voice		i suppose i could try setting my harddrive to ide, but i dont know how to set acpi=off, and apparently that isn't really a fix anyway
2008-02-03T10:12:00.000Z	voice		:(
2008-02-03T10:12:00.000Z	voice		but i really want to try ubuntu!
2008-02-03T10:12:00.000Z	voice		:P
2008-02-03T10:13:00.000Z	voice		i tried using the latest alpha of 8.04 too, and that started throwing errors at me
2008-02-03T10:14:00.000Z	voice		i just wanted to see if the issues with my chipset were fixed
2008-02-03T10:14:00.000Z	voice		with the new distro
2008-02-03T10:14:00.000Z	travisat	voice	what is your chipset?
