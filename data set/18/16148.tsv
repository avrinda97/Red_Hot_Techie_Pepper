2005-08-07T15:12:00.000Z	CircleofChaos		What does this mean: "The channel demigods have stolen your voice"?
2005-08-07T15:13:00.000Z	thoreauputic	CircleofChaos	probably that some channel has you +q - are you registered?
2005-08-07T15:14:00.000Z	thoreauputic	CircleofChaos	+q is a mode that silences a user
2005-08-07T15:14:00.000Z	thoreauputic	CircleofChaos	 /msg nickserv help
2005-08-07T15:15:00.000Z	thoreauputic	CircleofChaos	 and /msg nickserv register <nick> <password> IIRC
2005-08-07T15:17:00.000Z	thoreauputic	CircleofChaos	depends - if you are registered normally you can speak in any channel
2005-08-07T15:17:00.000Z	thoreauputic	CircleofChaos	I don't know what #perl's policy is
2005-08-07T15:18:00.000Z	thoreauputic	CircleofChaos	in #ubuntu anyone can speak - within reason :)
2005-08-07T15:19:00.000Z	thoreauputic	CircleofChaos	within the Code of Conduct for Ubuntu
2005-08-07T15:20:00.000Z	thoreauputic	CircleofChaos	which country? THis is international
2005-08-07T15:22:00.000Z	thoreauputic	CircleofChaos	you might want to ask in #freenode, or /msg a freenode staff member
2005-08-07T15:30:00.000Z	thoreauputic	CircleofChaos	are you sure the ops in #perl didn't silence you? maybe /msg a #perl op or something
2005-08-07T15:31:00.000Z	thoreauputic	CircleofChaos	I take it you have now registered?
2005-08-07T15:32:00.000Z	thoreauputic	CircleofChaos	well, this isn't magic -if you change your nick you are no longer recognised
2005-08-07T15:34:00.000Z	thoreauputic	CircleofChaos	if you did *that* in #perl, you would never be allowed back, I would say
2005-08-07T15:35:00.000Z	thoreauputic	CircleofChaos	in many channels that would have been an automatic kick
2005-08-07T15:36:00.000Z	thoreauputic	CircleofChaos	you just spammed the channel with a huge paste
2005-08-07T15:41:00.000Z	thoreauputic	CircleofChaos	don't take anything too much to heart - IRC is a strange subculture with it's own netiquette and rules :)
