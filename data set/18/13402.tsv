2005-11-23T14:39:00.000Z	grace		socket 754 just like this board I got hear
2005-11-23T14:40:00.000Z	grace		make a floppy and reboot
2005-11-23T14:41:00.000Z	grace		strange problem the win32 on amd64 linux
2005-11-23T14:43:00.000Z	grace		you need a dos boot floppy and
2005-11-23T14:43:00.000Z	grace		then copy those files to the floppy
2005-11-23T14:43:00.000Z	grace		when it boots into dos then you can run the exe that updates the bios
2005-11-23T14:44:00.000Z	Andypoo	grace	That generally doesn't work because the extracted files are too big to also fit on the floppy, and the self-extractors are GUI :(
2005-11-23T14:45:00.000Z	grace	Andypoo	you can get dos boot images and use a linux raw write to do it
2005-11-23T14:45:00.000Z	Andypoo	grace	<nod>  That helps too :)
2005-11-23T14:46:00.000Z	Andypoo	grace	Yah -- that's another reason it is so handy to have BIOS' with built-in utils :)
2005-11-23T14:48:00.000Z	grace	Andypoo	he looking at other screen
2005-11-23T14:50:00.000Z	grace	Andypoo	is having dejavu
