2006-12-13T08:43:00.000Z	cablesm102	loki505	I'd think that that was a network problem, nothing to do with Ubuntu.
2006-12-13T08:48:00.000Z	cablesm102	loki505	what are you doing here?
2006-12-13T08:49:00.000Z	cablesm102	loki505	do you use Ubuntu?
2006-12-13T08:49:00.000Z	cablesm102	loki505	do you have a wireless router?
2006-12-13T08:50:00.000Z	cablesm102	loki505	if there are no drivers for it, there's no way to get it working
2006-12-13T08:51:00.000Z	cablesm102	loki505	what's the file extension for the driver?
2006-12-13T08:52:00.000Z	cablesm102	loki505	is it a .sh?
2006-12-13T08:54:00.000Z	cablesm102	loki505	I'm pming you
