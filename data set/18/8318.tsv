2007-09-05T11:27:00.000Z	private_guy		and its not booting
2007-09-05T11:27:00.000Z	private_guy		how come? :(
2007-09-05T11:27:00.000Z	private_guy		It just loads windowsd
2007-09-05T11:27:00.000Z	private_guy		*windows
2007-09-05T11:28:00.000Z	private_guy		Whats Grub
2007-09-05T11:28:00.000Z	private_guy		and how do I install it
2007-09-05T11:28:00.000Z	Dr_willis	private_guy	 given the VERBOSE description you gave - we have no idea. Do you even see a 'menu' to pick the os to boot?
2007-09-05T11:28:00.000Z	Dr_willis	private_guy	 what is your hard drive layout? theres no need to spam across several lines... keep it on one line.
2007-09-05T11:30:00.000Z	Dr_willis	private_guy	 it was using grub befor most likely. its a good sign that it DID work befor.
2007-09-05T11:35:00.000Z	private_guy	Dr_willis	Oh, so on Ubuntu 7, it doesn't have Grub?
2007-09-05T11:36:00.000Z	Dr_willis	private_guy	 it should be using grub as well.
2007-09-05T11:37:00.000Z	Dr_willis	private_guy	 i would have to say that the MBR installed to the wrong drive. as a guess...  or it failed to install.
2007-09-05T11:38:00.000Z	Dr_willis	private_guy	 thers no one command..  you need to 'read' how to fix grub.. or just reinstall and see if any error messages show up, or try the alternative install cd.
2007-09-05T11:38:00.000Z	Dr_willis	private_guy	 normally it goes on the mbr of the primary hd. Do you have just the 1 hd?
2007-09-05T11:39:00.000Z	Dr_willis	private_guy	 as a test. i would set the pc to boot off the 2nd hd first. (in the bios) or some pc's have a Fkey to change what hd to boot.
2007-09-05T11:40:00.000Z	Dr_willis	private_guy	 i would guess it isntalled to the other hd, as a first guess. :)
