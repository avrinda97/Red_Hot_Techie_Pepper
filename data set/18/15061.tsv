2006-11-05T17:05:00.000Z	anto9us	Dab	then type ./l and press tab, it should complete the command for you :)
2006-11-05T17:07:00.000Z	anto9us	Dab	ok, cd /media/ then press tab, you'll see a list of them, it may be cdrom0
2006-11-05T17:08:00.000Z	anto9us	Dab	you can also drag the the icon into the terminal window, it will put the command in for you
2006-11-05T17:13:00.000Z	anto9us	Dab	you need to change the execute permission on the file
2006-11-05T17:13:00.000Z	anto9us	Dab	right click it and select properties
2006-11-05T17:14:00.000Z	anto9us	Dab	are there any instructions on installing to Linux on that CD?
2006-11-05T17:35:00.000Z	anto9us	Dab	you'll get a lot more conversation, usually, in #ubuntu-offtopic :)
