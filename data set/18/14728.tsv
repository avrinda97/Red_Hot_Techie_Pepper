2008-10-11T10:27:00.000Z	Jacobbs		I was looking into FreeNAS
2008-10-11T10:27:00.000Z	Jacobbs		But I want to run Ubuntu Server as the OS
2008-10-11T10:27:00.000Z	Jacobbs		Yep, I know.
2008-10-11T10:27:00.000Z	Jacobbs		It's an OS
2008-10-11T10:27:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	Jacobbs	 depends on wht fileserving tasks you want to do.. ubuntu can work as a fileserver
2008-10-11T10:27:00.000Z	Jacobbs		dr_Willis, hmmm cool.
2008-10-11T10:28:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	Jacobbs	 about any linux can work as a fileserver. :)
2008-10-11T10:28:00.000Z	Jacobbs		Well, I'll probably be doing other stuff as well

2008-10-11T10:29:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	Jacobbs	 ive heard there are nfs clients for windows.. but nevr used one.. or seen a free one.
2008-10-11T10:30:00.000Z	Jacobbs		I'm mostly doing files less than 25kb
2008-10-11T10:30:00.000Z	Dr_willis_	Jacobbs	 for windows - you will wan tto use samba, or ssh
