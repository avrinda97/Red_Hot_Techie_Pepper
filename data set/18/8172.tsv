2007-11-26T10:01:00.000Z	kasansweat		Can a wireless connection drop merely from inactivity (as opposed to a bad connection?)
2007-11-26T10:03:00.000Z	usr13	kasansweat	Depends on what's managing the network interfaces
2007-11-26T10:04:00.000Z	kasansweat	usr13	Hmm, interesting. would that be network-admin vs. command line? I'm trying to figure out why I have a wireless connection dropping.
2007-11-26T10:05:00.000Z	usr13	kasansweat	Check to see what the signal looks like: iwconfig
2007-11-26T10:05:00.000Z	kasansweat	usr13	That's what's odd. I get 100% signal strength
2007-11-26T10:06:00.000Z	usr13	kasansweat	What makes  you think that the wireless connection gets "dropped"?
2007-11-26T10:07:00.000Z	kasansweat	usr13	I use that pc as an always on server. It loses its connection.
2007-11-26T10:07:00.000Z	usr13	kasansweat	Could you re-phrase that?
2007-11-26T10:07:00.000Z	kasansweat	usr13	as in I can't ssh to it, if I go upstairs and try to ping the router, it doesn't, etc. etc.
2007-11-26T10:07:00.000Z	usr13	kasansweat	Is it a desktop PC or a laptop?
2007-11-26T10:08:00.000Z	kasansweat	usr13	Sorry, lets try that again. Let's call the server/computer/upstairs pc leonard - Leonard is a desktop with a wireless card
2007-11-26T10:09:00.000Z	kasansweat	usr13	I've done this setup before, with an old laptop..connection stayed up forever, no problem. I used it as a fileserver and ran sshfs through it, everything was cool. Am trying to recreate that, but it appears as if Leonard is dropping the connection.
2007-11-26T10:10:00.000Z	usr13	kasansweat	What OS is on it?
2007-11-26T10:10:00.000Z	kasansweat	usr13	Ubuntu
2007-11-26T10:10:00.000Z	usr13	kasansweat	What OS is on lenoard
2007-11-26T10:11:00.000Z	kasansweat	usr13	ubuntu is on leonard. and everything else I use that touches the net. No other os's here to speak of.
2007-11-26T10:11:00.000Z	usr13	kasansweat	Is lenard set to static IP
2007-11-26T10:12:00.000Z	kasansweat	usr13	No, but I've set my router to give it the same address every time
