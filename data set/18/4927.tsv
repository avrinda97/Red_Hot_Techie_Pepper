2009-05-11T16:59:00.000Z	flukxo	shadeslayer	i tried loading the fglrx drivers on another machine with ati hd 3300 and apparently they miss the id for this chipset, making the box slow and unusable
2009-05-11T16:59:00.000Z	shadeslayer	flukxo	did you see if your card is already supported or not by ati or does ubuntu have native support?
2009-05-11T17:01:00.000Z	flukxo	shadeslayer	ati has support for it on catalyst 9.4, i'm not too sure about ubuntu.
2009-05-11T17:02:00.000Z	shadeslayer	flukxo	check the wiki then
2009-05-11T17:02:00.000Z	flukxo	shadeslayer	do you think i should try the ati binary with the "make distribution package" option?
2009-05-11T17:02:00.000Z	shadeslayer	flukxo	can you enable compiz?
2009-05-11T17:03:00.000Z	flukxo	shadeslayer	no, i don't care for compiz right now. just wanted to put my resolution back to 1650x1200
2009-05-11T17:04:00.000Z	shadeslayer	flukxo	what about system > prefrences >display
2009-05-11T17:05:00.000Z	flukxo	shadeslayer	only goes as high as 1280x1024
2009-05-11T17:05:00.000Z	flukxo	shadeslayer	and it doesn't detect the monitor anymore
2009-05-11T17:06:00.000Z	flukxo	shadeslayer	gdm?

2009-05-11T17:08:00.000Z	flukxo	shadeslayer	thanks a lot for your help, if this doesn't fix it, i'll just install jaunty.
2009-05-11T17:09:00.000Z	shadeslayer	flukxo	this is interpid?
2009-05-11T17:11:00.000Z	flukxo	shadeslayer	yes
2009-05-11T17:12:00.000Z	shadeslayer	flukxo	always better to try out the latest version
2009-05-11T17:12:00.000Z	flukxo	shadeslayer	ok, i just wanted a quick dirty fix to get back to work
