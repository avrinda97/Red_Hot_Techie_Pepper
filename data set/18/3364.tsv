2009-10-22T22:00:00.000Z	Pranav	trism	ok, :)
2009-10-22T22:00:00.000Z	trism	Pranav	or change the theme
2009-10-22T21:58:00.000Z	trism	Pranav	well, xlock is in the xlockmore package, which is what I believe icewm uses to lock the screen
2009-10-22T22:00:00.000Z	Pranav	trism	I installed the xlock but the buttom is still disabled for lock workstation when I press Ctrl+Alt+Del. Although I can run the lock using xlock from the terminal
2009-10-22T22:00:00.000Z	Pranav	trism	Should I need a restart ?
2009-10-22T22:00:00.000Z	trism	Pranav	yep that did it my button works now, you need to restart icewm
2009-10-22T22:30:00.000Z	Pranav	trism	I can manually run any screensaver from the menu in IceWM but when I use the lock buttom after C+A+D keys, the only screensaver that runs is black screen. Where can I change this to random ?
2009-10-22T22:33:00.000Z	trism	Pranav	set the LockCommand in ~/.icewm/preferences, by default in /usr/share/icewm it is set to LockCommand="xlock -remote -mode blank"
2009-10-22T22:35:00.000Z	trism	Pranav	I believe you just have to change it to -mode random
2009-10-22T22:36:00.000Z	Pranav	trism	doing so actually there's no ~/.icewm/preferences file..
2009-10-22T22:36:00.000Z	trism	Pranav	I don't know if creating one with completely override /usr/share/icewm/preferences or just add to it, but you're probably safer copying /usr/share/icewm/preferences to ~/.icewm/preferences and editing that
2009-10-22T22:57:00.000Z	Pranav	trism	thanks It worked
2009-10-22T22:58:00.000Z	Pranav	trism	even changed the opaque window dragging feature to 0 in that file
2009-10-22T22:59:00.000Z	trism	Pranav	yeah, it has quite a few prefs to mess with in there
2009-10-22T23:18:00.000Z	trism	Pranav	I believe aterm has transparency, and it is pretty lightweight
2009-10-22T23:19:00.000Z	Pranav	trism	jonaskoelker I want it only in xterm, is there a way cant find in man pages
2009-10-22T23:20:00.000Z	trism	Pranav	I don't think xterm supports transparency
2009-10-22T23:21:00.000Z	trism	Pranav	like aterm that I suggested above
