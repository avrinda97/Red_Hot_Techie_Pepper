2005-09-13T14:09:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp		to enable me to use a usb-drive, i believe i have to edit /etc/fstab - however - i have no idea how to do this.  would someone be so kind as to point me in the correct direction please?
2005-09-13T14:10:00.000Z	robotgeek	Lunar_Lamp	a usb drive should automount /media/<label of usb drive>
2005-09-13T14:11:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp	robotgeek	- i am not using Gnome, i am using kfce - should it stil automount?
2005-09-13T14:11:00.000Z	robotgeek	Lunar_Lamp	no
2005-09-13T14:11:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp	robotgeek	- didn't think so! :-)
2005-09-13T14:11:00.000Z	robotgeek	Lunar_Lamp	though you might want to try out 'pmount'
2005-09-13T14:13:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp	robotgeek	syntax is pmount device [label]  it says in the manual - but i am so new to linux - that it still doesn't make too much sense to me.  firstly, what options do i need, secondly, what do i enter as "device"?
2005-09-20T10:52:00.000Z	robotgeek	Lunar_Lamp	if you want someone to help, u need to give details of the wireless card etc

2005-09-20T10:56:00.000Z	robotgeek	Lunar_Lamp	hmm...i was abt to suggest you to do that same thing...
2005-09-20T10:57:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp	robotgeek	i installed them ok - but when i tried to install raconfig - it didn't work
