2009-03-10T08:56:00.000Z	coty		Can someone please tell me how to enable emerald window manager in ubuntu
2009-03-10T08:57:00.000Z	ryanprior	coty	emerald no longer is maintained or supported in Ubuntu. We suggest using Compiz now.
2009-03-10T08:58:00.000Z	coty	ryanprior	Ok well I made the update to 9.04 and the window manager that compiz uses isn't displaying and no one in #ubuntu+1 is answering me on how to get the window manager back.
2009-03-10T08:58:00.000Z	coty	ryanprior	After I enabled compiz it just disappeared on me.
2009-03-10T08:58:00.000Z	ryanprior	coty	That often happens if your graphics card reports that it does not support render extensions.
2009-03-10T09:00:00.000Z	coty	ryanprior	I don't understand why it would since it didn't in 8.10
2009-03-10T09:00:00.000Z	coty	ryanprior	So does compiz not support geforce 6200 now or something?
2009-03-10T09:03:00.000Z	coty	ryanprior	thank you will look into it
2009-03-10T09:04:00.000Z	coty	ryanprior	I've already installed the restricted drivers
2009-03-10T09:05:00.000Z	coty	ryanprior	I wonder if the problem has to do with the driver I'm using which is 180. I don't remember that driver ever supporting 6200 but ubuntu recommended it for some reason.
2009-03-10T09:06:00.000Z	ryanprior	coty	I think that's covered somewhere in the documentation, but I don't deal with nvidia hardware myself so I'm really not fresh. I've always had ATI cards.
2009-03-10T09:07:00.000Z	coty	ryanprior	Do you think what ever it will be fixed in the final release?
2009-03-10T09:07:00.000Z	coty	ryanprior	I really don't want to give up compiz
2009-03-10T09:09:00.000Z	ryanprior	coty	We can hope everything will be fixed eventually; but because some things are problems with the closed drivers, and the graphics subsystems are going under some pretty major revisions anyway, I dare not prognosticate things getting better in the short term.
2009-03-10T09:10:00.000Z	coty	ryanprior	Big changes hmm wonder what there changing in the graphics
2009-03-10T09:12:00.000Z	ryanprior	coty	Cool stuff is afoot. We're getting a new direct render interface, the graphics execution manager, kernel mode setting, NVIDIA is rolling out this whole VDPAU framework for decoding video on the GPU, lots of new stuff.
2009-03-10T09:13:00.000Z	coty	ryanprior	sounds pretty cool! :D
