2005-10-10T06:52:00.000Z	durt		gdorn: "nvidia"
2005-10-10T06:53:00.000Z	durt		zblach, what do you mean?
2005-10-10T06:55:00.000Z	durt		zblach, are you using ndiswrapper, and you have to modprobe it all the time?
2005-10-10T06:55:00.000Z	GDorn	durt	 I have that, but startx says "failed to load nvidia kernel module"
2005-10-10T06:56:00.000Z	GDorn	durt	 ahh.  module nvidia not found.  now what?
2005-10-10T06:59:00.000Z	GDorn	durt	 no such file or directory
2005-10-10T07:02:00.000Z	GDorn	durt	 yeah, in /lib/modules/2.6.10-5-386/kernel/drivers/video/.  only I'm on breezy, which is 2.6.12-9-386
2005-10-10T07:03:00.000Z	GDorn	durt	 you mean apt-get install nvidia-glx?
2005-10-10T07:04:00.000Z	GDorn	durt	 says I already have that...
2005-10-10T07:05:00.000Z	GDorn	durt	 doing that now.  I'm pretty sure I've done that already before, though
2005-10-10T07:05:00.000Z	GDorn	durt	 yeah, no change.
2005-10-10T07:09:00.000Z	GDorn	durt	 hey, I nuked /lib/modules/2.6.10-5-386, uninstalled and reinstalled nvidia-glx, and suddenly there's nvidia.ko in the right place.  but it doesn't show up in locate
2005-10-10T07:13:00.000Z	GDorn	durt	 nope.  fatal, not found.
2005-10-10T07:13:00.000Z	GDorn	durt	just rebooted in the hopes that it might find it, still nothing
2005-10-10T07:16:00.000Z	GDorn	durt	 okay, updatedb done.  locate now says that nvidia.ko is in /lib/modules/2.6.12-9-386/volatile
2005-10-10T07:18:00.000Z	GDorn	durt	 well, if I actually go to that path and insmod it, it seems to install it, but then modprobe can't find it
2005-10-10T07:26:00.000Z	GDorn	durt	 oh, think I may have found something.  I don't have linux-restricted-modules for the right kernel installed.  trying that.
2005-10-10T07:28:00.000Z	GDorn	durt	 yup.  that did it.  shouldn't the upgrade to breezy have done that automatically?  is this a bug?
