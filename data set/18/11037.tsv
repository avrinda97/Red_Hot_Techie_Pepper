2006-09-23T14:38:00.000Z	Skarr		Linux is confusing
2006-09-23T14:39:00.000Z	arnducky		If you understand regexp and UNIX dir structure you 'find' is more powerfull though
2006-09-23T14:40:00.000Z	arnducky	Skarr	anything new and different can be confusing.  Don't give up!
2006-09-23T14:40:00.000Z	Skarr	arnducky	OK, thanks, I almost did a couple times
2006-09-23T14:40:00.000Z	arnducky		(look at me: ten years ago I was right where you are, and now I break Linux even faster and harder than before -- just ask fyrestrtr )
