2010-04-06T18:50:00.000Z	adalal		anyone here know how to make ubuntu act as a headset for a mobile to pick up and dial calls?
2010-04-06T18:51:00.000Z	acicula	adalal	youd have to present the bluetooth profile for that, not sure if thats implemented (or planned)
2010-04-06T18:53:00.000Z	adalal	acicula	i see what you mean, but if it's implemented on other linux platforms such as maemo, it shouldn't be difficult to implement it here
2010-04-06T18:53:00.000Z	acicula	adalal	depends on how its implemented on maemo
2010-05-15T19:04:00.000Z	acicula	adalal	they are pretty common for bluetooth and wifi
2010-05-15T19:05:00.000Z	adalal	acicula	yes, im trying to get a bcm4318 card to work with ubuntu...
2010-05-15T19:06:00.000Z	acicula	adalal	fresh installation?
2010-05-15T19:06:00.000Z	adalal	acicula	it's a minimal install with a couple of services running, so more or less fresh
2010-05-15T19:08:00.000Z	acicula	adalal	no gui?
2010-05-15T19:08:00.000Z	adalal	acicula	nope, it's meant to run as a server

2010-05-15T19:10:00.000Z	acicula	adalal	you will also have to fiddle with wpa_supplicant in that case and define the wireless connection details manually in /etc/network/services
2010-05-15T19:10:00.000Z	adalal	acicula	that's the easy bit for me :)
2010-05-15T19:11:00.000Z	acicula	adalal	according to the wiki page https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/bcm43xx the open source driver works, if not then else you have to use ndiswrapper to try the windows driver
2010-05-15T19:11:00.000Z	adalal	acicula	thanks
2010-05-15T19:12:00.000Z	acicula	adalal	for what its worth running laptops 24/7 in their normal form is not exactly something their made for
2010-05-15T19:12:00.000Z	adalal	acicula	yeah, im aware, but the load on the server is so negligible, and the laptop is an old spare one anyways, so i dont mind
2010-05-15T19:13:00.000Z	acicula	adalal	ok :) let me know if the wiki page / ndiswrapper solves your connection issue
