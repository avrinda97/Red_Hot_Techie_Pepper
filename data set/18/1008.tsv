2011-07-23T05:14:00.000Z	OogyPoogy		When Ubuntu gets upgraded and Gnome 2 is removed, do you think there will be a way to reinstall it? I really can't get used to Unity for some reason...
2011-07-23T05:14:00.000Z	th0r	OogyPoogy	you might want to consider debian at that point
2011-07-23T05:15:00.000Z	OogyPoogy	th0r	is Debian as user-friendly as Ubuntu?
2011-07-23T05:22:00.000Z	th0r	OogyPoogy	I would love to compare my xfce/debian screenshots with your gnome/ubuntu <smile>
2011-07-23T05:23:00.000Z	OogyPoogy	th0r	could you show me? I really want to know if there something wrong with XFCE as I installed it...
2011-07-23T05:25:00.000Z	th0r	OogyPoogy	pastebin won't handle pix, I think
2011-07-23T05:25:00.000Z	OogyPoogy	th0r	imgur.com?

2011-07-23T05:30:00.000Z	OogyPoogy	th0r	That actually looks quite nice
2011-07-23T05:31:00.000Z	OogyPoogy	th0r	How long did it take you to theme it up all nice like that?
2011-07-23T05:32:00.000Z	th0r	OogyPoogy	I had to untar two theme packages and set up the panels the way I wanted...maybe half an hour
2011-07-23T05:33:00.000Z	OogyPoogy	th0r	Oh that's not too bad....does XFCE come on the Live CD?
2011-07-23T05:34:00.000Z	th0r	OogyPoogy	you can just load xfce to your present ubuntu install...no need to get a new cd
2011-07-23T05:35:00.000Z	OogyPoogy	th0r	How would I do this? Via Synaptic?
2011-07-23T05:36:00.000Z	th0r	OogyPoogy	yes, just load xfce4 and thunar. there are other parts to xfce (xfburn, ristretto, etc) but those two will ge tyou started
2011-07-23T05:36:00.000Z	OogyPoogy	th0r	Thanks, I'll install now.
2011-07-23T05:37:00.000Z	th0r	OogyPoogy	after installing xfce4, log out and at the login screen Session menu choose xfce
2011-07-23T05:37:00.000Z	OogyPoogy	th0r	will do.
