2009-09-08T14:32:00.000Z	Dishtroyer		Ubuntu will not boot after an unclean shutdown. It says that I must run fsck manually and then asks for a root password. There is no password that I know of. HELP
2009-09-08T14:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dishtroyer	boot to live cd and fsck your partitions
2009-09-08T14:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dishtroyer	its the cd you installed with (or usb)
2009-09-08T14:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dishtroyer	then you need the live cd desktop
2009-09-08T14:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dishtroyer	you cant fsck mounted partitions
2009-09-08T14:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dishtroyer	well, you can but its not advised at all

2009-10-15T11:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dishtroyer	boot to the live cd and read this:
2009-10-15T11:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dishtroyer	man fsck
2009-10-15T11:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dishtroyer	boot to live cd desktop, unmount all partitions and run: sudo fsck -a /dev/sda5
2009-10-15T12:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dishtroyer	if you mean your logon/sudo password you can boot to root recovery console and type: passwd <your username here>
2009-10-15T12:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dishtroyer	to set your password
2009-10-15T12:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dishtroyer	if you are already logged in as the same user, you can simply run passwd to set your own password
2009-10-15T12:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dishtroyer	are you logged in as alan?
2009-10-15T12:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dishtroyer	if you type: whoami    does it say    alan
2009-10-15T12:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dishtroyer	then just type: passwd     then, you can now set your password
2009-10-15T12:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dishtroyer	is it asking for the current password?
2009-10-15T12:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Dishtroyer	your password is the one you type when you use sudo, or when synaptic asks you for a password
