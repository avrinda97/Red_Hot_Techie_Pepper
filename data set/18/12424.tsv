2006-06-01T09:02:00.000Z	knanand		what is de cmd to install rpm packages
2006-06-01T09:02:00.000Z	Warbo	knanand	Use alien on them first, and that is a bit dodgy
2006-06-01T09:04:00.000Z	knanand	Warbo	is it alien <pkg_name> ??
2006-06-01T09:04:00.000Z	Warbo	knanand	You need the rpm file in the directory your terminal is in (default is home) then "sudo alien packagefile.rpm"
2006-06-01T09:07:00.000Z	knanand	Warbo	alien cmd not found.
2006-06-01T09:08:00.000Z	Warbo	knanand	You need to install it (sudo apt-get install alien)
2006-07-09T16:35:00.000Z	Warbo	knanand	Try easyubuntu maybe
2006-07-09T16:36:00.000Z	Warbo	knanand	Or at least it's repos
2006-07-09T16:40:00.000Z	knanand	Warbo	I get an error like this "opera: Depends: xlib6g (>=3.3.6) but it is not installable or xlibs  but it is not installable"
2006-07-09T16:42:00.000Z	Warbo	knanand	Try installing the "xlibs-dev" package
2006-07-09T16:48:00.000Z	knanand	Warbo	I get the same error after installing xlibs...
2006-07-09T16:48:00.000Z	Warbo	knanand	Maybe get the .deb from opera.com then (it is buried quite deeply I believe)
2006-07-09T16:50:00.000Z	knanand	Warbo	ok.. hope that works... but i get an error when i try to update also.. is this related to this problem??
2006-07-09T16:51:00.000Z	Warbo	knanand	I would disable any extra repos during an upgrade
2006-07-09T16:58:00.000Z	knanand	Warbo	I think there is something serious problem.. The deb that i downloaded from Opera.com also dint work...
2006-07-09T05:00:00.000Z	knanand	Warbo	It gives an error like this "dpkg: error processing opera_9.0-20060616.6-shared-qt_en_i386.deb (--install): cannot access archive: No such file or directory Errors were encountered while processing: opera_9.0-20060616.6-shared-qt_en_i386.deb"
2006-07-09T05:00:00.000Z	Warbo	knanand	Well that says that the file doesn't exist. Try renaming it to something simpler
2006-07-09T05:03:00.000Z	knanand	Warbo	Hey thank you.. I had downloaded it to some other location.. I could install it now. Thank You again :)
