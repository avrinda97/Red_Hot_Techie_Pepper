2004-12-04T09:54:00.000Z	BWF89		hmmm
2004-12-04T09:54:00.000Z	BWF89		but we have 24 hours not 20
2004-12-04T09:54:00.000Z	jdub	BWF89	it's totally different
2004-12-04T09:52:00.000Z	jdub	BWF89	it's a wacky thing swatch thought would be a good idea
2004-12-04T09:52:00.000Z	jdub	BWF89	kinda like decimal time ;)
2004-12-04T09:54:00.000Z	jdub	BWF89	time based on 10 rather than 12
2004-12-04T09:54:00.000Z	jdub	BWF89	(or really, 10000 or whatever swatch used)
2004-12-04T09:54:00.000Z	jdub	BWF89	internet time uses 10000 clicks or something
2004-12-04T09:54:00.000Z	jdub	BWF89	and also totally irrelevant ;)
2004-12-04T09:56:00.000Z	jdub	BWF89	no, it's a gnome thing. i don't know why it hasn't been removed yet.
