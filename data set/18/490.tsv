2012-01-29T08:26:00.000Z	xKazeSenoue	Ben64	It is a Compaq Presario F700, with an integrated GeForce Go 6100
2012-01-29T08:27:00.000Z	xKazeSenoue	Ben64	I installed it with my external display. Everything goes fine, but when Ubuntu boots, it just goes to black, while I can see a little on my broken screen, because there is a little part that is still fine
2012-01-29T08:27:00.000Z	xKazeSenoue	Ben64	You want a picture?
