2005-12-06T17:04:00.000Z	T80U		BTW what are some good ways to secure  Ubuntu:?
2005-12-06T17:04:00.000Z	topyli	T80U	what exactly are you afraid of? ;-)
2005-12-06T17:10:00.000Z	topyli	T80U	if you run services, you have to either configure them to listen to localhost only, or use a firewall
2005-12-06T17:10:00.000Z	topyli	T80U	unless you actually want them visible
2005-12-06T17:11:00.000Z	topyli	T80U	installing and configuring firestarter is a good start
2005-12-06T17:12:00.000Z	topyli	T80U	well if you have a hardware firewall that's even better
2005-12-06T17:13:00.000Z	topyli	T80U	well, open the port for your web server
2005-12-06T17:15:00.000Z	topyli	T80U	configure apache properly and keep it up to date, open port 80, profit!
2005-12-06T17:16:00.000Z	topyli	T80U	you don't
