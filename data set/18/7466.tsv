2008-05-11T04:24:00.000Z	Ash908		I'm sorry I'm being vague but I have no clue what
2008-05-11T04:24:00.000Z	Ash908		i hate you, enter key.
2008-05-11T04:26:00.000Z	Ash908		My system has been acting weird in that it will stop responding to input on the desktop and the entire system has been freezing, even the kernel, and I have to hold the power button. (I'm sorry I'm being vague but I have no clue what is wrong)
2008-05-11T04:27:00.000Z	RyanPrior	Ash908	Does dmesg say anything funny?
2008-05-11T04:27:00.000Z	Ash908	RyanPrior	let me check...
2008-05-11T04:28:00.000Z	Ash908	RyanPrior	i can tell compiz is not running right...
2008-05-11T04:28:00.000Z	Ash908	RyanPrior	no.
2008-05-11T04:28:00.000Z	Ash908	RyanPrior	and i can't run dmesg when the kernel freezes.
2008-05-11T04:29:00.000Z	RyanPrior	Ash908	any pattern to when the freezes happen?
2008-05-11T04:30:00.000Z	Ash908	RyanPrior	...for the kernel freeze, when changing workspaces with compiz on.
2008-05-11T04:30:00.000Z	Ash908	RyanPrior	otherwise it might just be compiz. but the inital login (first login after boot) seems to hang for awhile before resizing the desktop.
2008-05-11T04:31:00.000Z	RyanPrior	Ash908	Have you tried disabling compiz?
2008-05-11T04:31:00.000Z	Ash908	RyanPrior	...i don't want to disable compiz...
2008-05-11T04:32:00.000Z	RyanPrior	Ash908	It's still important to know for sure whether Compiz is causing the problem. If disabling Compiz stops the problem, then that gives us valuable information.
2008-05-11T04:33:00.000Z	Ash908	RyanPrior	well the kernel freeze isn't something that i know how to trigger really...
2008-05-11T04:33:00.000Z	Ash908	RyanPrior	i turned off compiz.
2008-05-11T04:34:00.000Z	RyanPrior	Ash908	If you still get the kernel freeze with Compiz disabled, then you can probably say it's nothing with Compiz.
2008-05-11T06:14:00.000Z	RyanPrior	Ash908	You'll have to give more info before we can help.
