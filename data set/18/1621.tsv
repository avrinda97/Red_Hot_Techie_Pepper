2011-01-06T12:53:00.000Z	MAGIK_NINJA		ok i have a 500 gb hd with windows 7 installed, and a secondary 150gb hd with nothing on it but my files music, movies, games, etc. i tried to install ubuntu 9.10 from a disk someone burned for me, it was scratched or something because it didnt work right, and then when i tried to load windows i got some kind of problem with GRUB, couldnt fix that withought reinstalling windows 7, so i took all my files from the 500 gb hd with win7
2011-01-06T12:53:00.000Z	MAGIK_NINJA		just barely running it from the disk, so then i reinstalled windows, and now when i try to access that 150 gb hd from windows it gives me the error message i wrote before
2011-01-06T12:53:00.000Z	MAGIK_NINJA		does that cover it all?
2011-01-06T12:55:00.000Z	MAGIK_NINJA		something about mounting the drive?
2011-01-06T12:56:00.000Z	MAGIK_NINJA		jordan: thats where i looked but only like some sort of partition or backup part of it is there
2011-01-06T12:56:00.000Z	nit-wit	MAGIK_NINJA	is the external a ext or NTFS
2011-01-06T12:57:00.000Z	MAGIK_NINJA	nit-wit	its not external, its a drive in the pc, and i think its ntfs
2011-01-06T12:58:00.000Z	nit-wit	MAGIK_NINJA	can you open a partitioner and find out, so it is not seen by W7 correct.
2011-01-06T12:59:00.000Z	MAGIK_NINJA	nit-wit	its a WDC WD1600JB-00FUA0 ATA Device
2011-01-06T13:00:00.000Z	nit-wit	MAGIK_NINJA	sre you in W7

2011-01-06T13:02:00.000Z	nit-wit	MAGIK_NINJA	in the admin account open the disk manager and look to see if it shows if it does take a screen shot/snippet and imagebin it.http://imagebin.org/index.php?page=add
2011-01-06T13:04:00.000Z	MAGIK_NINJA	nit-wit	in windows, or ubuntu?
2011-01-06T13:04:00.000Z	nit-wit	MAGIK_NINJA	do you actually have a linux install?
2011-01-06T13:04:00.000Z	MAGIK_NINJA	nit-wit	i have ubuntu installed on the same drive as windows
2011-01-06T13:05:00.000Z	nit-wit	MAGIK_NINJA	well your getting lots of hits here so to speak, so it seems others feel they have the answer
2011-01-06T13:11:00.000Z	nit-wit	MAGIK_NINJA	I can't really tell exactly what your problem is can you explain it succinctly. Are you booting both OS/ Is it you can't access the 150 gig drive?
