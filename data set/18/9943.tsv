2008-01-23T09:09:00.000Z	CyberMad		how to check size and free size of memory ?
2008-01-23T09:09:00.000Z	CyberMad		i google it, but can not find it
2008-01-23T09:09:00.000Z	CyberMad		du -h, df -h is for checking harddisk size.. i don't know about memory
2008-01-23T09:10:00.000Z	CyberMad		i think something weird with my linux.. please see this:
2008-01-23T09:10:00.000Z	CyberMad		             total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
2008-01-23T09:10:00.000Z	CyberMad		Mem:        499736     490776       8960          0      68584     250532
2008-01-23T09:11:00.000Z	CyberMad		i upgrade my memory to 512 from 256, but the free memory size is still too small :( why?
2008-01-23T09:11:00.000Z	CyberMad		i will paste the whole information after free command, just a second...

2008-01-23T09:13:00.000Z	CyberMad		btw, is that correct 512 ? the total 499736
2008-01-23T09:15:00.000Z	wolferine	CyberMad	run memtest on your RAM
2008-01-23T09:17:00.000Z	wolferine	CyberMad	its on the Ubuntu installation CD
2008-01-23T09:17:00.000Z	wolferine	CyberMad	there is no 'memtest' in the repos
2008-01-23T09:26:00.000Z	wolferine	CyberMad	run memtest yet ?
2008-01-23T09:26:00.000Z	CyberMad	wolferine	yes, i run it with command: memtest 512M
2008-01-23T09:27:00.000Z	wolferine	CyberMad	never run it from command line, as memory is being used, which could cause your results to not be true
2008-01-23T09:28:00.000Z	CyberMad	wolferine	run from qw
2008-01-23T09:28:00.000Z	CyberMad	wolferine	 then run from where? :)
