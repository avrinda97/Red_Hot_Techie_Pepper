2006-06-16T12:49:00.000Z	Sivik		how do i specify to have a certain user as the only system admin in the sudoer file
2006-06-16T12:49:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Sivik	ffs, man sudo
2006-06-16T12:49:00.000Z	Sivik	fyrestrtr	ffs?
2006-06-16T12:52:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Sivik	just don't add them to the admin group
2006-06-16T12:52:00.000Z	Sivik	fyrestrtr	but what if their already there
2006-06-16T12:52:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Sivik	you can always remove them from the admin group.
2006-06-16T12:52:00.000Z	Sivik	fyrestrtr	how??????????????????
2006-06-16T12:53:00.000Z	Sivik	fyrestrtr	that was the second time i asked you how to do it
2006-06-16T12:54:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Sivik	you have two options, you can use the usermod command -- or you can directly edit the /etc/groups file.
2006-06-16T12:55:00.000Z	Sivik	fyrestrtr	thats not what i'm trying to do
2006-06-16T12:55:00.000Z	Sivik	fyrestrtr	so it has nothing to do with the sudoer file?
2006-06-16T12:56:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Sivik	look, by default -- unless you give a user permissions, or add them to a group that has permissions to sudo, then they cannot sudo. Now in ubuntu, the 'default' user is added to the group 'admin' and this group is allowed to sudo. Now when you add a new user and you don't want them to sudo -- don't add them to the admin group. If they are in the admin group already, remove them from that group by either editing /etc/group or by u
2006-06-16T12:57:00.000Z	Sivik	fyrestrtr	but i'm trying to remove someone, not add them
2006-06-16T12:59:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Sivik	its like okay -- either I tell you .. go here, edit this file, remove this -- and it works, but next time around, you are back asking the same question. Or I tell you how it works. :)
2006-06-16T13:00:00.000Z	Sivik	fyrestrtr	i understand how it works, i just didn't know what the file needed to say
2006-06-16T13:00:00.000Z	Sivik	fyrestrtr	i was trying to tell someone else, just couldn't remember what i needed to be set as if you have more than one user and you only wanted one to be the sudoer
