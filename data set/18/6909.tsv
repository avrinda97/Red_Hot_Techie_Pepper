2008-03-05T11:22:00.000Z	icesword	iancp	vmware,what product you use?vmware workstation or vmware server
2008-03-05T11:23:00.000Z	icesword	iancp	that depends?how many ram you have
2008-03-05T11:24:00.000Z	icesword	iancp	you know,virtualbox is free,yeah it is good,you can use virtualbox
2008-03-05T11:25:00.000Z	icesword	iancp	no,listen to me,i even use vmware to run ubuntu 7.10 in 100m ram
2008-03-05T11:25:00.000Z	iancp	icesword	really? and it runs smooth?
2008-03-05T11:26:00.000Z	icesword	iancp	not really,it only can run,but couldn't called multitask system right then
2008-03-05T11:26:00.000Z	icesword	iancp	but you have 1g ram,it is enough,i recommend you try virtualbox,though it will use more ram than vmware

2008-03-05T11:30:00.000Z	icesword	iancp	vmware player is only a player,you can only use it to open that virtual system
2008-03-05T11:31:00.000Z	icesword	iancp	yeh,it is free also,vmware-server,try it if you are curious what to use
2008-03-05T11:31:00.000Z	icesword	iancp	no,you are welcome,just feel free to ask
