2009-11-17T00:11:00.000Z	TripleDES		hi, all
2009-11-17T00:12:00.000Z	TripleDES		anyone having problems with karmic and usb devices on netbooks?
2009-11-17T00:13:00.000Z	TripleDES		got it...
2009-11-17T00:13:00.000Z	TripleDES		:)
2009-11-17T00:14:00.000Z	TripleDES		I have two different netbooks, hp mini and medion akoya, both have problems with usb devices. The hp mini freezes when copying files from a usb massive storage device and medion is unable to use my 3g usb modem....
2009-11-17T00:14:00.000Z	TripleDES		I was able to perform both tasks before upgrading to karmic
2009-11-17T00:16:00.000Z	TripleDES		I think I'm going to ask on the forums to decide whether I need to open a bug report or not....
2009-11-17T00:16:00.000Z	Horus	TripleDES	not really much help, but sounds like it's maybe a usb support problem not addressed in the karmic kernel for your netbooks.  Could try to recompile the kernel.
2009-11-17T00:17:00.000Z	TripleDES	Horus	I think it is, but they both have different chipsets and found that weird....two chipsets with similar bug?....
2009-11-17T00:18:00.000Z	TripleDES	Horus	will try to recompile the kernel tonight....
2009-11-17T00:18:00.000Z	TripleDES	Horus	you mean a vanilla kernel ?
2009-11-17T00:18:00.000Z	Horus	TripleDES	that is odd.  hmm... haven't seen anyone else with the issue, but then again I haven't been looking and I'm still new to ubuntu, coming from gentoo ;)
2009-11-17T00:19:00.000Z	Horus	TripleDES	yup
2009-11-17T00:19:00.000Z	TripleDES	Horus	I'm a gentoo user too ;)
2009-11-17T00:19:00.000Z	Horus	TripleDES	hahaha!  nice!  I've been using karmic for about a week and I gotta admit... it's slick as hell.  I was a ubuntu skeptic, but now I'm a believer.
2009-11-17T00:20:00.000Z	TripleDES	Horus	that's my case too! but still keeping gentoo at non-desktop sytems
2009-11-17T00:21:00.000Z	TripleDES	Horus	will grab the latest vanilla kernel and recompile it, let's see...
2009-11-17T00:21:00.000Z	Horus	TripleDES	hope it works man!
