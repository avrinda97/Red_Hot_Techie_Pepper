2009-12-16T17:59:00.000Z	roof		i think my MBR is fucked, how do i fix this people?
2009-12-16T18:00:00.000Z	roof		the thing i dont understand is why deleting my swap partition would effect the boot process?
2009-12-16T18:01:00.000Z	roof		is the new partition i created now set as bootable, if so, how do i set the other partition as bootable
2009-12-16T18:01:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	roof	i don't think grub needs the disk to be set as bootable.
2009-12-16T18:02:00.000Z	roof		i dont even get the grub boot loader coming ip i get "no bootable disk - please insert and reboot"
2009-12-16T18:02:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	roof	you can toggle the bootable flag by using fdisk, but make sure you have a good tutorial or guide before doing so
2009-12-16T18:02:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	roof	oh, then you need to reinstall grub
2009-12-16T18:02:00.000Z	roof		im in livecd now, but not sure whats happened
2009-12-16T18:03:00.000Z	roof		is grub installed to MBR or is it chainloaded from primary boot loader?
2009-12-16T18:03:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	roof	it's chainloaded
2009-12-16T18:04:00.000Z	roof		so what is stored in the MBR?
2009-12-16T18:04:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	roof	barely more than a pointer to the existing grub.
2009-12-16T18:04:00.000Z	roof		a flag that tells it where to find the 2nd bootloader - the foot flag
2009-12-16T18:05:00.000Z	roof		action, its not the FS thjat is that issue, I have no secondary bootloader at all.
2009-12-16T18:05:00.000Z	roof		its as if there is no disk, it must be MBR
2009-12-16T18:05:00.000Z	roof	howlingmadhowie	how do i check the flag?
2009-12-16T18:06:00.000Z	roof		i have ubuntu live running
2009-12-16T18:06:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	roof	sorry, i dunno :( pc hardware isn't my speciality :(
