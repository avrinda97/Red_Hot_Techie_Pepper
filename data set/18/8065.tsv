2007-10-23T06:07:00.000Z	Jordan_U		Does anyone here have a fresh install of feisty?
2007-10-23T06:09:00.000Z	LiMaO	Jordan_U	i use feisty. and it was fresh installed some while ago.
2007-10-23T06:09:00.000Z	Jordan_U	LiMaO	Have you installed many packages?
2007-10-23T06:10:00.000Z	LiMaO	Jordan_U	a lot of them =P
2007-10-23T06:10:00.000Z	Jordan_U	LiMaO	Then you can't help me, thanks for the offer though
2007-10-23T06:11:00.000Z	LiMaO	Jordan_U	alright then. but you could say your problem in the channel, maybe someone can help ya, even if they have a long time running system
2007-10-25T07:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	LiMaO	There is if you are running Dapper ;)
2007-10-25T07:41:00.000Z	LiMaO	Jordan_U	i'm running feisty.. and i really don't want to go thru gutsy and have everything broken up =/
2007-10-26T09:03:00.000Z	Jordan_U	LiMaO	It wont get any better
2007-10-26T09:03:00.000Z	Jordan_U	LiMaO	There are a huge amount of people having problems with every release
2007-10-26T09:04:00.000Z	LiMaO	Jordan_U	but oh man.. feisty wasn't this troublesome... there were minor problems, that's for sure. but gutsy is giving too much of a headache to most people
2007-10-26T09:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	LiMaO	There are also people who will swear by older versions, there were people who suggested not upgrading from Edgy even though it has been the least stable release so far
2007-10-26T09:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	LiMaO	Have you personally had problems with Gutsy?
2007-10-26T09:05:00.000Z	LiMaO	Jordan_U	i loved the gutsy feel. it's fast, beautiful, works nice. it sure was a big improvement over the older releases, but too many minor problems
2007-10-26T09:06:00.000Z	LiMaO	Jordan_U	yes, i can list some
2007-10-26T09:06:00.000Z	LiMaO	Jordan_U	openoffice doesn't work correctly with some themes. compiz gives problems with some wine applications, even if it's turned off.
2007-10-26T09:07:00.000Z	LiMaO	Jordan_U	my panels kept disappearing all the time, i had to right click them to have them back
2007-10-26T09:07:00.000Z	LiMaO	Jordan_U	nautilus would freeze all the time when browsing folders with many files (over 500 for instance)
