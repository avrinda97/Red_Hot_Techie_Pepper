2008-08-24T19:25:00.000Z	wols_	wathek	then use apt-cdrom as you've been told
2008-08-24T19:25:00.000Z	wathek	wols_	apt-cdrom won't help me to make a mirror will it ?
2008-08-24T19:26:00.000Z	wols_	wathek	<dpkg> it has been said that apt-mirror is a tool for making a local mirror for any apt source, look at http://apt-mirror.sf.net
2008-08-24T19:28:00.000Z	wols_	wathek	before you can create a repository you first need to have the packages that make up the repo
2008-08-24T19:28:00.000Z	wols_	wathek	and if those packages are on ubuntu cd, then you don't need to create a local repo
2008-08-24T19:28:00.000Z	wathek	wols_	I have that in my Ubuntu CD
2008-08-24T19:29:00.000Z	wathek	wols_	that's what I'm looking for
2008-08-24T19:29:00.000Z	wols_	wathek	then you don't need a local repo. your cd is already one
2008-08-24T19:29:00.000Z	wathek	wols_	just have to add the entry deb cdrom.... to my mirror.list file ?
2008-08-24T19:29:00.000Z	wols_	wathek	there is no mirror.list file
2008-08-24T19:29:00.000Z	wathek	wols_	no need to do apt-mirror ?
2008-08-24T19:30:00.000Z	wathek	wols_	huh ?!
2008-08-24T19:30:00.000Z	wathek	wols_	mirror.list is the file configuration of apt-mirror !
2008-08-24T19:30:00.000Z	wols_	wathek	if you have the ubuntu cdrom it'S all you need
2008-08-24T19:30:00.000Z	wols_	wathek	you didn't explain clearly what you have and want to do
2008-08-24T19:31:00.000Z	wathek	wols_	I need to setup a local mirror using the Ubuntu CD coz I want to install Ubuntu on a computer that can only boot from network and I don't want it to download the packages from the internet coz it'll take a long time so I'm gonna to boot in expert mode and put the adress of my local mirror that contains the CD's Packages
2008-08-24T19:33:00.000Z	wathek	wols_	you see ?
2008-08-24T19:34:00.000Z	wols_	wathek	I do. but the answer stays the same. good day
