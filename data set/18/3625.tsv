2009-09-01T15:14:00.000Z	cummseng		How come my linux laptop cannot resolve a computers hostname but my windows machine can?
2009-09-01T15:14:00.000Z	Radtoo	cummseng	.. woops, nibbler already answered that. can you give us the hostname you're trying to resolve?
2009-09-01T15:15:00.000Z	cummseng	Radtoo	its just the name of the computer. Loungeroom-PC
2009-09-01T15:16:00.000Z	Radtoo	cummseng	... yes, but where do you enter it?
2009-09-01T15:16:00.000Z	cummseng	Radtoo	im trying to use gigolo
2009-09-01T15:16:00.000Z	cummseng	Radtoo	i cant even ping it
2009-09-01T15:17:00.000Z	Radtoo	cummseng	hmm, seems like that could be either SMB or FTP or SFTP... I guess its a window share then, tho.
2009-09-01T15:18:00.000Z	Radtoo	cummseng	well, pinging would resolve names differently than smb would. at least usually.
2009-09-01T15:18:00.000Z	Radtoo	cummseng	I bet you can ping the computer's IP address if it is not firewalled or the router prevents it, tho.
2009-09-01T15:18:00.000Z	cummseng	Radtoo	yes i can ping the ip, but not the hostname.
2009-09-01T15:20:00.000Z	Radtoo	cummseng	That's because the name resolution for windows shares and web sites / pinging / etc can work differently.
2009-09-01T15:22:00.000Z	cummseng	Radtoo	My router can see the names of my windows machines, how come it cant see linux?
2009-09-01T15:23:00.000Z	Radtoo	cummseng	Again, it is important to tell what "type" of name you mean... regular host names as used for web servers and such, or the windows share names?
2009-09-01T15:28:00.000Z	Radtoo	cummseng	you know what? do you have bind and its tools installed on your ubuntu? you can use "dig" to query the regular name servers as they are used on the internet (no netbios), that might answer some questions.
2009-09-01T15:29:00.000Z	cummseng	Radtoo	Grawity, i figured it out. I had to add wins to /etc/nsswitch.conf
2009-09-01T15:30:00.000Z	Radtoo	cummseng	I think we can set up the linux machines similarly if we know whether you need samba, a normal name server entry (possibly asked for by dhcp) ...
2009-09-01T15:30:00.000Z	Radtoo	cummseng	ah, nice
2009-09-01T15:31:00.000Z	Radtoo	cummseng	well congrats, then :)
