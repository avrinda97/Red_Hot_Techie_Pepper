2010-07-10T13:46:00.000Z	bihari		well i have problem when  i open my terminal i got this message "There was a problem with the command for this terminal"
2010-07-10T13:48:00.000Z	oCean_	bihari	does the terminal start, or does the command just fail?
2010-07-10T13:49:00.000Z	oCean_	bihari	use <alt><f2> and try to start xterm
2010-07-10T13:51:00.000Z	bihari	oCean_	  use <alt><f2> and try to start xterm well this works but its to small
2010-07-10T13:51:00.000Z	oCean_	bihari	yeah, but wait. Now, in xterm, run the command: gnome-terminal
2010-07-10T13:51:00.000Z	oCean_	bihari	see if there are more useful error messages
2010-07-10T13:52:00.000Z	bihari	oCean_	 i got the same message again " i got this meesage when i open the terminal "There was a problem with the command for this terminal" also "Text was empty (or contained only whitespace)"
2010-07-10T13:55:00.000Z	oCean_	bihari	hmm.. you might have (accidentally) changes a setting in terminal properties
2010-07-10T13:55:00.000Z	bihari	oCean_	yes i think so ? but how to rectify this problem
2010-07-10T13:56:00.000Z	oCean_	bihari	same issue here: https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-terminal/+question/60506. But indeed: how to fix this?
2010-07-10T13:59:00.000Z	oCean_	bihari	try this. Check (in menus) System > Preferences  > Preferred Applications and see on System tab
2010-07-10T14:01:00.000Z	bihari	oCean_	i am usingubuntu 9.10
2010-07-10T14:04:00.000Z	oCean_	bihari	okay, I don't know what the equivalent menu entry in 9.10 is, sorry. For me it gives an option to modify/customize startup of gnome-terminal
2010-07-10T14:04:00.000Z	bihari	oCean_	 its ok :)
2010-07-10T14:27:00.000Z	oCean_	bihari	Dr_Willis So I found where your personal settings (for gnome-terminal) are: ~/.gconf/apps/gnome-terminal/profiles/Default. If you changed preferences it should be there
2010-07-10T14:30:00.000Z	oCean_	bihari	or copy the ones for billgates into yours
2010-07-10T14:30:00.000Z	oCean_	bihari	since that is where the gnome-terminal preferences are
2010-08-13T20:17:00.000Z	oCean_	bihari	are you aware that this is not virtualbox help channel?
