2007-04-08T10:52:00.000Z	sayao	lilphil	http://monkey-messenger.blogspot.com/
2007-04-08T10:53:00.000Z	lilphil	sayao	thats *very* msn like. I'm very fond of Psi - its clean and simple, and standards complient
2007-04-08T10:54:00.000Z	sayao	lilphil	it is an msn client hehe
2007-04-08T10:54:00.000Z	lilphil	sayao	oh right, there you go then :)
2007-04-08T10:55:00.000Z	lilphil	sayao	I'm not so fond of having my conversations logged by microsoft - have you ever read the eula? :)
2007-04-08T10:55:00.000Z	sayao	lilphil	i think they can't do that, it's illegal
2007-04-08T11:21:00.000Z	lilphil	sayao	I'd still rather have encryption, and a server I can trust... (eg, one i setup myself... :) )
2007-04-08T11:17:00.000Z	lilphil	sayao	http://messenger.msn.com/help/terms.aspx states they consider communication to be private but "However, we may monitor your communications and disclose information about you, including the content of your communications" then there's 3 if's
2007-04-08T11:18:00.000Z	sayao	lilphil	:(
2007-04-08T11:18:00.000Z	lilphil	sayao	notice how one of the if's is "if we consider it necessary to: ... protect the interests of Microsoft"
2007-04-08T11:19:00.000Z	sayao	lilphil	i can write an encryption plugin hehe
2007-04-08T11:19:00.000Z	lilphil	sayao	or you could use a protocol that is open and already uses ssl ! :)
2007-04-08T11:19:00.000Z	sayao	lilphil	oh, wait, msn has p2p conversation
2007-04-08T11:19:00.000Z	sayao	lilphil	so microsoft would never get them
2007-04-08T11:20:00.000Z	lilphil	sayao	its also worth a look at the number of msn traffic sniffers available
2007-04-08T11:20:00.000Z	sayao	lilphil	msn has 2 methods of conversations, one that goes thru the server other is p2p
2007-04-08T11:20:00.000Z	lilphil	sayao	thats good at least :)
