2011-10-13T03:35:00.000Z	Asurah		Hey folks
2011-10-13T03:36:00.000Z	Asurah		Can anyone help with a quite crucial problem?
2011-10-13T03:37:00.000Z	Asurah		Oh well
2011-10-13T03:39:00.000Z	Asurah		I'm quite new to Ubuntu, tried to install it today, both 64 and 32bit versions (got a 64bit comp), installation goes on perfectly fine, I press the restart button at the end, take the CD out, but it simply gets stuck in boot
2011-10-13T03:39:00.000Z	Asurah		i.e after BIOS, before actual OS loads.
2011-10-13T03:41:00.000Z	almoxarife	Asurah	anything else installed on the pc?
2011-10-13T03:42:00.000Z	Asurah	almoxarife	- I've got two HDD, one is the OS which is formatted before Ubuntu installation, other one is data
2011-10-13T03:45:00.000Z	almoxarife	Asurah	what type of install disc did you use?
2011-10-13T03:45:00.000Z	Asurah	almoxarife	I just downloaded the .iso from the official site and burned it on a CD..
2011-10-13T03:47:00.000Z	almoxarife	Asurah	I would suggest you download the 'alternate' version and redo the install, I have never had issues with a ;alternate' but have had with the 'desktop'
2011-10-13T03:48:00.000Z	Asurah	almoxarife	- is there any difference for a beginner user like myself?
2011-10-13T03:49:00.000Z	almoxarife	Asurah	the install or final desktop?
2011-10-13T03:49:00.000Z	Asurah	almoxarife	- both?
2011-10-13T03:51:00.000Z	almoxarife	Asurah	same desktop will be avail, the alternate comes with more avail drivers for the install, a good thing. the install menu is the same basic one, I also suggest having the machine hardwired if possible to the internet
2011-10-13T03:52:00.000Z	Asurah	almoxarife	- think I'll try to run it alongside Windows and see if that works. Then I'll download the entire thing again and try it again
2011-10-13T03:53:00.000Z	almoxarife	Asurah	you said there was no other OS
2011-10-13T03:53:00.000Z	almoxarife	Asurah	good luck
2011-10-13T03:53:00.000Z	Asurah	almoxarife	- I reinstalled Windows so I could get into the support
