2010-10-19T19:40:00.000Z	jiffe1		if I want to have a full X desktop from a remote linux machine on my windows laptop would I have to use something like vnc?
2010-10-19T19:40:00.000Z	jiffe1		I can't run a local X server on the windows machine and get a full desktop right?
2010-10-19T19:41:00.000Z	tensorpudding	jiffe1	There is an X server on Windows
2010-10-19T19:40:00.000Z	tensorpudding	jiffe1	yeah, probably
2010-10-19T19:40:00.000Z	tensorpudding	jiffe1	there's also NX
2010-10-19T19:41:00.000Z	tensorpudding	jiffe1	You can use it to forward X11 through ssh
2010-10-19T19:41:00.000Z	jiffe1	tensorpudding	does it provide a full desktop though or so I just open windows by running commands on commandline?
2010-10-19T19:42:00.000Z	tensorpudding	jiffe1	it's not like remote desktop though; you can't use it to control programs already running
2010-10-19T19:42:00.000Z	tensorpudding	jiffe1	the latter
2010-10-19T19:42:00.000Z	jiffe1	tensorpudding	yeah I'm looking for something that I can get going menu driven
2010-10-19T19:42:00.000Z	tensorpudding	jiffe1	X11 forwarding basically allows you to run the application on the Linux machine, but the X11 bits get forwarded to the X11 server on the Windows machine
2010-10-19T19:43:00.000Z	jiffe1	tensorpudding	I couldn't use that to create a gnome desktop locally I suppose?
2010-10-19T19:43:00.000Z	tensorpudding	jiffe1	if you want to do something like logging into GNOME from on the Windows machine, there's XDMCP
2010-10-19T19:44:00.000Z	tensorpudding	jiffe1	I'm pretty sure that GDM no longer supports XDMCP though
2010-10-19T19:45:00.000Z	jiffe1	tensorpudding	yeah it doesn't look like anything is listening on port 177
2010-10-19T19:50:00.000Z	tensorpudding	jiffe1	I recommend checking out FreeNX, it's a lot better than VNC
2010-10-19T19:50:00.000Z	tensorpudding	jiffe1	a lot better meaning that it's faster and more secure
