2005-03-30T10:56:00.000Z	apokryphos	lawman	you might want to try reconfiguring your x
2005-03-30T10:56:00.000Z	apokryphos	lawman	or rather, xfree or xorg
2005-03-30T10:57:00.000Z	apokryphos	lawman	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg.. most probably
2005-03-30T10:57:00.000Z	apokryphos	lawman	where are you? Irssi?
2005-03-30T11:01:00.000Z	apokryphos	lawman	same command above
2005-03-30T11:02:00.000Z	apokryphos	lawman	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2005-03-30T11:03:00.000Z	apokryphos	lawman	you can switch bitween windows using Ctrl + Alt + F1 I think...
2005-03-30T11:05:00.000Z	apokryphos	lawman	you don't know whether you're using nvidia or ATI...?
2005-03-30T11:06:00.000Z	apokryphos	lawman	one sec
2005-03-30T11:06:00.000Z	apokryphos	lawman	there is; I think it's lspci
2005-03-30T11:07:00.000Z	apokryphos	lawman	better leave it on what it's on, then.
2005-03-30T11:08:00.000Z	apokryphos	lawman	have you reconfigured it?
2005-03-30T11:09:00.000Z	apokryphos	lawman	did you say you did the whole reconfiguration?
