2006-11-08T15:56:00.000Z	JohnRobert		where abouts would I put source code for libraries I wanted to compile things against... like instead of downloading a -dev package, where would a normal configure script be looking for source?
2006-11-08T15:58:00.000Z	dooglus	JohnRobert	build the library then use "sudo checkinstall" to install it as a package.  configure looks in /usr/lib/pkgconfig/ for a corresponding .pc file
2006-11-08T15:59:00.000Z	dooglus	JohnRobert	you'll need to install "checkinstall" probably.  it's a lazy-man's way of making packages
2006-11-08T15:59:00.000Z	dooglus	JohnRobert	don't run the "make install" step - "sudo checkinstall" is instead of doing that
2007-10-20T17:32:00.000Z	JohnRobert	dooglus	what are you getting at? :) Go into prefrences and then power management
2007-10-20T17:32:00.000Z	dooglus	JohnRobert	I doubt there's a preference for 'shut down randomly'
2007-10-20T17:33:00.000Z	dooglus	JohnRobert	looks like it hit this: Oct 20 14:24:48 trpaslik kernel: [21244.372000] ACPI: Critical trip point
2007-10-20T17:33:00.000Z	JohnRobert	dooglus	sounds interesting...perhaps that one is worth of a bug report..
2007-10-20T17:34:00.000Z	dooglus	JohnRobert	it's never worth raising ubuntu bug reports in my experience.  the bug will be ignored until the next release, then closed due to inactivity.
2007-10-20T17:35:00.000Z	JohnRobert	dooglus	are you sure your laptop isn't getting too hot...and then shutting itself off?
2007-10-20T17:36:00.000Z	JohnRobert	dooglus	perhaps the new compiz fusion is making it run hotter...
2007-10-20T17:36:00.000Z	dooglus	JohnRobert	I expect that's what happened, yes.  old versions of ubuntu didn't used to manage the CPU speed properly, so it would happen.  it was fixed about a year ago, and now seems to be broken again.  the OS is supposed to step the CPU speed down to manage the temperature.
2007-10-20T17:37:00.000Z	dooglus	JohnRobert	I don't use compiz
2007-10-20T17:37:00.000Z	JohnRobert	dooglus	I've always had probs with the speed step stuff with ubuntu...in that it doesn't work. I'm fairly sure you'll be able to alter your trip point... http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-452475.html
2007-10-20T17:38:00.000Z	dooglus	JohnRobert	I just tried opening that link.  It ran a 'mozilla feedback agent'?
2007-10-20T17:38:00.000Z	JohnRobert	dooglus	try reading this: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MobileAndEmbedded/power-thermal-optimizations
2007-10-20T17:38:00.000Z	JohnRobert	dooglus	skip all that feedback agent stuff
2007-10-20T17:40:00.000Z	dooglus	JohnRobert	he suggests blowing into the fan?  this is a software problem - the OS should manage the temperature, like it did in feisty.
