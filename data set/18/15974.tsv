2005-05-03T07:02:00.000Z	Amaranth		Appearently my integrated VIA sound thingie (dunno what to call it, it isn't a card) can do it.
2005-05-03T07:03:00.000Z	Amaranth		Well, applications using ALSA are a bit unstable sometimes because ALSA is relatively new.
2005-05-03T07:03:00.000Z	scizzo	Amaranth	is it?
2005-05-03T07:03:00.000Z	scizzo	Amaranth	ALSA from what I know has been around for a while
2005-05-03T07:03:00.000Z	Amaranth	scizzo	It's only been in the kernel since 2.6
2005-05-03T07:04:00.000Z	scizzo	Amaranth	the kernel yes...but ALSA itself has been around for quite a few years now
2005-05-03T07:04:00.000Z	Amaranth	scizzo	Sure, but most apps didn't use it because it wasn't standard.
2005-05-03T07:05:00.000Z	scizzo	Amaranth	the thing is that 2.6 is using ALSA as standard...there was support for it before
2005-05-03T07:05:00.000Z	scizzo	Amaranth	ummm.not really
2005-05-03T07:05:00.000Z	scizzo	Amaranth	most applications for example the applications coded against GNOME is using ESD because GNOME is using ESD sound server
2005-05-03T07:05:00.000Z	Amaranth	scizzo	That's my point.
2005-05-03T07:05:00.000Z	scizzo	Amaranth	and KDE is using another sort of soundserver
2005-05-03T07:06:00.000Z	Amaranth	scizzo	ESD supported alsa but the apps themselves didn't have to
2005-05-03T07:06:00.000Z	Amaranth	scizzo	The ones that use ALSA now use relatively new code for it so it can be buggy.
2005-05-03T07:13:00.000Z	Amaranth	scizzo	ESD and aRtsd aren't even needed anymore and that isn't always true.
2005-05-03T07:14:00.000Z	scizzo	Amaranth	hehe....well some of us like the small mini sounds that comes when GAIM or something is sending a msg or something...hehe
2005-05-03T07:14:00.000Z	scizzo	Amaranth	:D
2005-05-03T07:14:00.000Z	Amaranth	scizzo	dmix
