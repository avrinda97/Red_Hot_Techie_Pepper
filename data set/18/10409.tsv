2012-06-29T23:22:00.000Z	r00t__	wylde	when I try to add a rule it tells me there is an error in adding a rule
2012-06-29T23:23:00.000Z	r00t__	wylde	erm...nevermind ill stop bugging you xD
2012-06-29T23:23:00.000Z	wylde	r00t__	you likely set an option wrong. :) Have a browse through the ufw info. It may help with setting proper rules.
2012-07-01T07:30:00.000Z	wylde	r00t__	if you want backtrack, use backtrak. Don't mix repos
2012-07-01T07:30:00.000Z	r00t__	wylde	I am just wanting some software from them...jesus you guys are defensive xD
2012-07-01T07:31:00.000Z	wylde	r00t__	their packages will very likely break your system. If you want that software and it isn't in ubuntu repos you're better off compiling from source.
2012-07-01T07:32:00.000Z	r00t__	wylde	oh i see
2012-07-01T07:35:00.000Z	wylde	r00t__	if you wanted to have backtrack on hand, you can actually keep the iso on the / or /boot partition and boot it from grub2
