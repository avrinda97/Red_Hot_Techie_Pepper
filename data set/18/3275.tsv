2009-11-04T08:13:00.000Z	Grelmy	TonyTheTiger	why can't you connect?
2009-11-04T08:13:00.000Z	TonyTheTiger	Grelmy	i dont know. it just doesnt work.
2009-11-04T08:14:00.000Z	TonyTheTiger	Grelmy	this is a fresh install btw.
2009-11-04T08:15:00.000Z	Grelmy	TonyTheTiger	was it working in an earlier version?
2009-11-04T08:17:00.000Z	Grelmy	TonyTheTiger	Did you check if there are proprietary drivers for it in System>administartion>HardwareDrivers ?
2009-11-04T08:17:00.000Z	TonyTheTiger	Grelmy	i think there may be, with the live usb it said there were, but after the install none seem to show up.
2009-11-04T08:18:00.000Z	Grelmy	TonyTheTiger	Try going to System>>administration>>SofwareSources, and make sure to check "proprietary drivers" source and "commmunity-maintainted" source
2009-11-04T08:19:00.000Z	TonyTheTiger	Grelmy	ok, i will try that. cheers.
2009-11-04T08:20:00.000Z	TonyTheTiger	Grelmy	the restricted and community boxes are both ticked.
2009-11-04T08:21:00.000Z	Grelmy	TonyTheTiger	OK, in Synaptic, "reload" the package list now
2009-11-04T08:21:00.000Z	TonyTheTiger	Grelmy	the restricted and community boxes are both ticked.
2009-11-04T08:22:00.000Z	Grelmy	TonyTheTiger	Yeah, after ticking the boxes go into synaptic and click the "reload" icon
2009-11-04T08:23:00.000Z	Grelmy	TonyTheTiger	oh ahah, i forgot, reloading the list needs internet access
2009-11-04T08:24:00.000Z	Grelmy	TonyTheTiger	My last idea is to check out what this guy tried: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1304900
2009-11-04T08:33:00.000Z	Grelmy	TonyTheTiger	you type commands into Applications>>Accessories.Terminal
2009-11-04T08:52:00.000Z	Grelmy	TonyTheTiger	"sudo lshw"
