2006-04-13T10:56:00.000Z	intelikey		hehhe i think it went to dev/null
2006-04-13T10:56:00.000Z	intelikey		thank you.
2006-04-13T10:58:00.000Z	intelikey		dabar that didn't change a thing here.  i still get "sudo: can't open /etc/sudoers: Permission denied "
2006-04-13T10:59:00.000Z	intelikey		you say you broke yours too dabaR ?

2006-04-13T11:01:00.000Z	intelikey		so dabaR you have a root passwd or are you in for a reboot ?
2006-04-13T11:01:00.000Z	intelikey		heh figures
2006-04-13T11:01:00.000Z	intelikey		mine is long and a pain to type in but i always have a root passwd
2006-04-13T11:02:00.000Z	intelikey		i think is like 50 something chars
2006-04-13T11:02:00.000Z	IcemanV9	intelikey	check your /etc/group to see if your username is added to "admin" line
2006-04-13T11:03:00.000Z	IcemanV9	intelikey	then you should be able to use sudo command
2006-04-13T11:03:00.000Z	intelikey	IcemanV9	i assume that root is
2006-04-13T11:03:00.000Z	intelikey	IcemanV9	besides root is explicitly in sudoers
2006-04-13T11:03:00.000Z	intelikey	IcemanV9	it's not a group issue
2006-04-13T11:04:00.000Z	IcemanV9	intelikey	in my group file -> admin:x:106:ubuntu,icemanv9 AND in my sudoers file -> %admin  ALL=(ALL) ALL
2006-06-11T10:30:00.000Z	intelikey	IcemanV9	that can be adjusted no?
2006-06-11T10:30:00.000Z	IcemanV9	intelikey	i've tried. nope.
