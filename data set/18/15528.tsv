2005-12-24T11:25:00.000Z	exarkun		evms crashes my system 5 times a day.  Is evms in dapper more stable?  would it make sense to just upgrade to a dapper kernel?
2005-12-24T11:26:00.000Z	exarkun		Or can I disable evms completely in breezy somehow?
2005-12-24T11:26:00.000Z	Ng	exarkun	how is evms crashing your machine?
2005-12-24T11:26:00.000Z	exarkun	Ng	By sucking I guess, I don't know
2005-12-24T11:26:00.000Z	Ng	exarkun	the implication of my question being "that is pretty unlikely" on the grounds that evms is entirely userspace
2005-12-24T11:27:00.000Z	exarkun	Ng	evms has kernel components.
2005-12-24T11:27:00.000Z	exarkun	Ng	Otherwise it wouldn't require a kernel patch to use
2005-12-24T11:27:00.000Z	Ng	exarkun	last I saw of it they removed them and rewrote it to use the existing device-mapper kernel components
2005-12-24T11:27:00.000Z	exarkun	Ng	Okay... did they do that before or after the 2.6.12 in Breezy?
2005-12-24T11:27:00.000Z	Ng	exarkun	I'm asking how you know it's evms doing it and not something else, basically
2005-12-24T11:28:00.000Z	exarkun	Ng	I don't know, of course.  But the last 30 times my system has crashed, evms has had the last entry in the system logs.
2005-12-24T11:28:00.000Z	exarkun	Ng	It will sit there quiet and nice for hours, and then the second it starts doing anything the system goes down.
2005-12-24T11:28:00.000Z	exarkun		every single time
2005-12-24T11:29:00.000Z	exarkun		I can post the logs if that would be helpful.  I don't actually know what evms does really, or why it would crash a machine.  The log files look pretty suspicious, though.
2005-12-24T11:30:00.000Z	Ng	exarkun	posting logs sounds like a good idea
2005-12-24T11:31:00.000Z	Ng	exarkun	unfortunately I have to go, but I see no mention of evms in the ubuntu kernel patch for 2.6.12
2005-12-24T11:31:00.000Z	exarkun		http://divmod.org/users/exarkun/evms-engine.log
2005-12-24T11:31:00.000Z	exarkun	Ng	Can you give me an URL for that log?
