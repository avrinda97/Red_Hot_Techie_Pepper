2008-04-15T11:05:00.000Z	djay-il	kelvin911	get to the terminal by ctrl+alt+ one of the F1 keys
2008-04-15T11:11:00.000Z	djay-il	kelvin911	alt+f7 will get you back to X windows
2008-04-15T11:12:00.000Z	djay-il	kelvin911	yes
2008-04-15T11:13:00.000Z	djay-il	kelvin911	alt f7 will get you back to graphics. now you're in terminal
2008-04-15T11:14:00.000Z	djay-il	kelvin911	but to disconnect someone connected to your machine, you need to find which terminal is he on, and close it
2008-04-15T11:14:00.000Z	djay-il	kelvin911	anyone "logged in" is on terminal
2008-04-15T11:15:00.000Z	djay-il	kelvin911	type 'w' or 'who' on terminal, and look for lines that are not you
2008-04-15T11:16:00.000Z	djay-il	kelvin911	yes
