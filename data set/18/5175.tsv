2009-06-11T20:59:00.000Z	dp_		where is pidgin listed within synaptic?
2009-06-11T21:01:00.000Z	dp_		where would I find other IM clients within synaptic?
2009-06-11T21:02:00.000Z	tiyowan	dp_	Instead of using synaptic - try searching from your add/remove menu. And yes, empathy is a good im client as well.
2009-06-11T21:02:00.000Z	dp_	tiyowan	I want to find others, and I'd like to just see a list
2009-06-11T21:03:00.000Z	tiyowan	dp_	It's difficult to see a categorized application-specific list in synaptic; it's really geared more towards being able to search for a package if you know part of its name.
2009-06-11T21:05:00.000Z	tiyowan	dp_	Anything useful? Or anything at all?
2009-06-11T21:05:00.000Z	dp_	tiyowan	anything at all
2009-06-11T21:06:00.000Z	tiyowan	dp_	What search term are you using?
2009-06-11T21:06:00.000Z	dp_	tiyowan	I'm not
2009-06-11T21:06:00.000Z	tiyowan	dp_	:)
2009-06-11T21:06:00.000Z	dp_	tiyowan	why the smiley?  no search terms, and I get no packages listed
2009-06-11T21:07:00.000Z	tiyowan	dp_	Try a search term, like IM, instant messenger, etc.
2009-06-11T21:07:00.000Z	dp_	tiyowan	I did.  again, nothing
2009-06-11T21:08:00.000Z	tiyowan	dp_	That's unusual - does searching for another type of application turn up a list?
2009-06-11T21:08:00.000Z	dp_	tiyowan	no.  always just the blank panels
2009-06-11T21:08:00.000Z	tiyowan	dp_	How long has been since you installed Ubuntu again?
2009-06-11T21:08:00.000Z	dp_	tiyowan	over a year
2009-06-11T21:09:00.000Z	tiyowan	dp_	If you can't turn up anything in add/remove, then something's wrong.
