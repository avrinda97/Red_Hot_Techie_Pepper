2009-06-29T00:37:00.000Z	grawity	arand	it wasn't, thanks
2009-07-18T18:27:00.000Z	arand	grawity	I don't think making an alias for ping might be such a good idea, rather "sping" for sudo ping or something,, Agat0n
2009-07-18T18:28:00.000Z	grawity	arand	Other than the -f option, I see nothing bad there.
2009-07-18T18:43:00.000Z	grawity	arand	Just 'ping', not 'mping'
2009-08-13T16:32:00.000Z	grawity	arand	The pipes are parsed by your shell, not by sudo.
2009-08-13T16:37:00.000Z	grawity	arand	This may be a bad suggestion, but still it would be much simpler to open a root shell with 'sudo -s', use what you want, then exit the root shell.
2009-08-13T16:39:00.000Z	arand	grawity	yes that's what I'm doing currently, I just figured it would be neter with just one command with a sudo in the right place. (but then again... "sudo -i && ... && exit")
2009-08-13T16:39:00.000Z	grawity	arand	You could try sudo bash -c 'foo | bar > somefile'
2009-08-13T16:40:00.000Z	arand	grawity	ah, that looks good.
2009-08-13T16:41:00.000Z	grawity	arand	If it's an often used command, you might put it in a shell script, and then use sudo to execute _that_.
2009-08-13T16:43:00.000Z	arand	grawity	not that common no (it's http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/252442/ btw, *Dangerous command*)
2009-08-13T16:44:00.000Z	grawity	arand	In that type of pipeline, when it ends with a command (not file), you can simply use 'sudo dd if=......'
2009-08-13T16:44:00.000Z	grawity	arand	Basically, gunzip -c ./5ubuntu_8gb_usb_backup.dd.gz.* | sudo of=/dev/sdb bs=1024 conv=notrunc
2009-08-13T16:46:00.000Z	arand	grawity	ok, I guessed it might be but was not sure, cheers.
2009-09-07T18:17:00.000Z	arand	grawity	moonlight?
2009-09-07T18:18:00.000Z	grawity	arand	<Abhi69?> moonlight
