2011-10-26T05:08:00.000Z	Harry_Slaughter		Question: Back in the day, I used to switch between virtual desktops (using Xwindows) by simply moving the mouse to the left or right edge of the screen. I'm trying to do the same thing in Ubuntu(10.04), but there only seem to be keyboard shortcuts. Am I only able to configure keyboard shortcuts it seems; Am I wrong?
2011-10-26T05:09:00.000Z	Harry_Slaughter		ooops, nm
2011-10-26T05:09:00.000Z	Harry_Slaughter		i guess they're called 'workspaces' now so i googled that: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=27251
2011-10-26T05:10:00.000Z	JokesOnYou77	Harry_Slaughter	I think that's it's an option in Compiz
2011-10-26T05:11:00.000Z	Harry_Slaughter	JokesOnYou77	my laptop is 6 years old and doesn't always like compiz :)
2011-10-26T05:12:00.000Z	JokesOnYou77	Harry_Slaughter	Understood.  Are you on Gnome?
2011-10-26T05:12:00.000Z	Harry_Slaughter	JokesOnYou77	yes
2011-10-26T05:12:00.000Z	Harry_Slaughter	JokesOnYou77	compiz mostly runs fine, but this is my work laptop and want to keep it running fast.
2011-10-26T05:14:00.000Z	JokesOnYou77	Harry_Slaughter	I'm not certain that there's an option in Gnome for what Compiz calls "switch on mouse" It's possible, though I'm really not sure, that you may be able to set it so that it will switch desktops with the mouse apprching if you hold down a particular key
2011-10-26T05:15:00.000Z	Harry_Slaughter	JokesOnYou77	i'm trying this http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=27251
2011-10-26T05:17:00.000Z	JokesOnYou77	Harry_Slaughter	I'm not really familear with that program, but it would be cool if you can get it to work
2011-10-26T05:18:00.000Z	JokesOnYou77	Harry_Slaughter	Nice!
2011-10-26T05:18:00.000Z	Harry_Slaughter	JokesOnYou77	it was actually already enabled but the switch delay was set too high, so i never saw it work
2011-10-26T05:19:00.000Z	JokesOnYou77	Harry_Slaughter	rofl, how do you like that?  Another satisfied customer I suppose ;)
2011-10-26T05:20:00.000Z	Harry_Slaughter	JokesOnYou77	very. i used redhat crap for over ten years. finally was sick of having to deal with all their F*ups and switched to Ubuntu. Love it, I'm sold.
2011-10-26T05:21:00.000Z	Harry_Slaughter	JokesOnYou77	and the wine project has come a long way since i last tried it, so i can run those few winblows apps that i need to
2011-10-26T05:22:00.000Z	Harry_Slaughter	JokesOnYou77	i actually purchased crossover after i learned that they employ core wine developers. and i like the way crossover sandboxes your applications so all  you need to do is delete a single directory to cleanly remove an application
2011-10-26T05:22:00.000Z	JokesOnYou77	Harry_Slaughter	Oh yeah, Wine has been excellent, really great documentation too.  Actually, the documentation and community are what have kept me with linux
