2008-10-25T13:23:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan		anyone know why "physical volume from Raid" is no longer a choice in the installer's "Use as:" option in the Create a new partition dialog /
2008-10-25T13:23:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan		?
2008-10-25T13:24:00.000Z	nikolam	CaptainMorgan	Are you installing from alternate disc?
2008-10-25T13:24:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	nikolam	I'm not familar with the term...
2008-10-25T13:25:00.000Z	nikolam	CaptainMorgan	There is 2 releases of u/k/xubuntu install cd`s Besides you ned to choose architecture (32/64) desktop or server, you can choose live or alternate text-install cd
2008-10-25T13:26:00.000Z	nikolam	CaptainMorgan	I always use alternate install cd
2008-10-25T13:32:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	nikolam	I've got one disk with an installed ubuntu... I have extra disk that I want to use as a mirrored raid 1, there's no data on the primary disk... should I just start over with the alternate cd or should I try to install software raid and include the second disk ?
2008-10-25T13:33:00.000Z	nikolam	CaptainMorgan	I always use alternate cd. So i don`t have a clue about installing on raid from desktop cd.
2008-10-25T13:33:00.000Z	nikolam	CaptainMorgan	I have multiple raid0, raid1 raid0 setup on 2 sata hdd`s,
2008-10-25T13:34:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	nikolam	and it was easiest for you with the alternate cd to setup your raid system? did you follow a guide you can recommend ?
2008-10-25T13:35:00.000Z	nikolam	CaptainMorgan	Dont forget After installing on Raid1 to Check with mdadm does raid1 reely USE 2 disks in raid1.. Turn the other on, i had situation where second one was no active by default..
2008-10-25T13:35:00.000Z	nikolam	CaptainMorgan	I first make raid partitions then restart, make raid and then install on it. all within setup from cd
2008-10-25T13:36:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	nikolam	and then when you came off the cd, ie: booted into the system for the first time, with the exception you just mentioned, everything worked as planned?
2008-10-25T13:37:00.000Z	nikolam	CaptainMorgan	Yes, just check is the second volume in raid reely active and activate it from mdadm
2008-10-25T14:39:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	nikolam	I like the alternate cd... wow... thank you for this... I like specifically setting things like this... and surprisingly, RAID was super easy to set up. Cheers.
2008-10-25T14:41:00.000Z	nikolam	CaptainMorgan	Glad you could make it . I always use alternate to install, cheers :)
2008-10-25T14:47:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	nikolam	is it normal for the base system installation to fail? I'm assuming no...
2008-10-25T14:51:00.000Z	nikolam	CaptainMorgan	No, it is not :) Something is wrong there.. Did you check your CD and is it installing on clean partition?
