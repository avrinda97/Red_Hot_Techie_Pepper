2010-10-09T08:50:00.000Z	furi		guys, i'd like to know about VNC and how it works; i've been trying to connect via VNC to my brother's computer for an hour, give or take, and it still isn't working, despite the fact that i've tried every answer i've looked up
2010-10-09T08:51:00.000Z	furi		oh, was just about to mention that
2010-10-09T08:51:00.000Z	furi		the other computer is vista
2010-10-09T08:51:00.000Z	furi		yes
2010-10-09T08:52:00.000Z	furi		and i'm using the remote thingy on here
2010-10-09T08:52:00.000Z	furi		oh?
2010-10-09T08:52:00.000Z	furi		well, then
2010-10-09T08:52:00.000Z	furi		sorry for my stupidity
2010-10-09T08:52:00.000Z	Ken8521	furi	yes, to my knowledge, windows does not support the rdp protocol
2010-10-09T08:51:00.000Z	Ken8521	furi	are both machines ubuntu?
2010-10-09T08:51:00.000Z	Ken8521	furi	did you install vncserver on the other machine?(assuming you're trying to view his desktop)
2010-10-09T08:52:00.000Z	Ken8521	furi	you also need to install vnc on your machine...
2010-10-09T08:53:00.000Z	Ken8521	furi	go to application/internet/terminal service client... where it says "protocol" is is VNC available?
2010-10-09T08:54:00.000Z	Ken8521	furi	thats why, ubuntu windows needs VNC..(at least XP does.. i'm assuming vista does also)
2010-10-09T08:54:00.000Z	Ken8521	furi	hang on a sec.
2010-10-13T09:58:00.000Z	furi	Ken8521	thanks.
2010-10-13T09:58:00.000Z	Ken8521	furi	your best bet is #wine
2010-10-13T09:58:00.000Z	furi	Ken8521	alright. thanks again.
