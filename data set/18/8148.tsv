2008-05-21T06:16:00.000Z	Firefishe		not I lwizardl
2008-05-21T06:17:00.000Z	bazhang	Firefishe	seems an error reading from the ntfs partition
2008-05-21T06:18:00.000Z	bazhang	Firefishe	no ntfs on linux
2008-05-21T06:19:00.000Z	Firefishe	bazhang	 Actually, the read/write problem, so far as I thought, was supposed to have been handled.
2008-05-21T06:19:00.000Z	Firefishe	bazhang	 Hasn't it?
2008-05-21T06:20:00.000Z	bazhang	Firefishe	copy some over to your ubuntu partition and try again
2008-05-21T06:20:00.000Z	Firefishe	bazhang	 And, so far as read-only is concerned, I have never had a problem with that until now.
2008-05-21T06:24:00.000Z	Firefishe	bazhang	 Apparently the file must be corrupt.  I say this because it copied all of 512KB over to my kde desktop, but it also gave me an error popup which said it couldn't copy it, at least it didn't copy it all.  Just the front part of End of the Innocence by
2008-05-21T06:25:00.000Z	bazhang	Firefishe	sounds more like there issues with that partition than anything
2008-05-21T06:26:00.000Z	bazhang	Firefishe	best boot into windows and defrag that partition pronto
2008-07-11T22:16:00.000Z	bazhang	Firefishe	please take chat elsewhere
2009-07-04T16:58:00.000Z	bazhang	Firefishe	lsb_release -a
2009-07-04T16:58:00.000Z	Firefishe	bazhang	thanks
2011-01-23T06:36:00.000Z	bazhang	Firefishe	I'd ask in #kubuntu
2011-01-23T06:37:00.000Z	bazhang	Firefishe	okay, just a suggestion
