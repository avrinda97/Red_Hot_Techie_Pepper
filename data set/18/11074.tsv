2007-03-06T14:55:00.000Z	umop		how do I remove the file size limiations on my ext3 partititons
2007-03-06T14:57:00.000Z	eck	umop	do you have terabyte sized files?
2007-03-06T14:57:00.000Z	eck	umop	for 8kb blocks (the default in ext3) the file size limit is 2 TB
2007-03-06T14:58:00.000Z	umop	eck	thanks, it must be something else
2007-03-06T14:58:00.000Z	eck	umop	what is the problem?
2007-03-06T14:58:00.000Z	umop	eck	I bet it's samba.. IM copying largish files from one computer to another
2007-03-06T14:59:00.000Z	eck	umop	if you can, you're much better off using rsync, losing data in the middle of the transfer won't waste the whole thing
2007-03-06T14:59:00.000Z	umop	eck	true.  I'll do that now.
2007-03-06T15:00:00.000Z	umop	eck	I was getting error File size limit exceeded (core dumped)" I just assumed it to be the filesystem
2007-03-06T15:21:00.000Z	umop	eck	I am having no joy with copying these files..Got any other suggestions?
2007-03-06T15:22:00.000Z	eck	umop	i think it might be an advanced option, with TCP the sequence numbers will roll around eventually and this could cause problems if you are copying really, really big files
2007-03-06T15:23:00.000Z	umop	eck	hmm
2007-03-06T15:25:00.000Z	eck	umop	i know FTP can support arbitrarily large files
2007-03-06T15:26:00.000Z	umop	eck	Yeah, I have a couple of ideas I may try.  Annoyed now, I'll leave it for a bit :)
2007-03-06T15:26:00.000Z	eck	umop	also, check your ulimits
2007-03-06T15:26:00.000Z	umop	eck	have done, they are all unlimited
2007-03-06T15:29:00.000Z	eck	umop	you might also try writing to a server mailing list (e.g. redhat-list) and seeing what people are using to copy really big files, i'm sure they would have the best advice for something that works and is efficent
2007-03-06T15:30:00.000Z	umop	eck	good idea, will do.
