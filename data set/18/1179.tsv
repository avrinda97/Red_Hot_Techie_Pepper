2011-05-10T06:52:00.000Z	jrib	maxa_	when you press ctrl-alt-f7, you see gdm?
2011-05-10T06:53:00.000Z	maxa_	jrib	: its show something like "checking battery, setting sensor and etc, then the result all OK
2011-05-10T06:54:00.000Z	jrib	maxa_	when you pressed ctrl-alt-f7?  How about ctrl-alt-f8 or ctrl-alt-f9?

2011-05-10T06:59:00.000Z	jrib	maxa_	check /var/log/Xorg.0.log, try stopping gdm, and starting it again (I must go, eyes are refusing to stay open)
2011-05-10T07:01:00.000Z	maxa_	jrib	: just quote /var/log/Xorg.0.log not include the "check" right?
2011-05-10T07:02:00.000Z	jrib	maxa_	it's just a text file that you should read to look for hints
2011-05-10T07:04:00.000Z	maxa_	jrib	: its say "command not found"
2011-05-10T07:04:00.000Z	jrib	maxa_	you must use a text editor to read it
2011-05-10T07:06:00.000Z	maxa_	jrib	: text editor? i cant go anywhere at my pc, its just black screen and nothing can do except try to type something to solve
2011-05-10T07:06:00.000Z	jrib	maxa_	good luck, I'm going to bed now
