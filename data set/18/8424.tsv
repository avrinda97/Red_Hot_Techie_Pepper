2007-11-28T12:14:00.000Z	SunsparcSolaris	Nubbie	what are you trying to do?
2007-11-28T12:17:00.000Z	Nubbie	SunsparcSolaris	essentially i was fooling around trying to install the macbar applet, which involves installing patched libgtk2.0-0 and other packages. my problem is downgrading from that patched version to the repository (gutsy) version without removing every single package which depended on gtk lol.
2007-11-28T12:17:00.000Z	SunsparcSolaris	Nubbie	seems like you have quite a problem on your hands ;)
2007-11-28T12:17:00.000Z	Nubbie	SunsparcSolaris	but i'm biting the bullet lol. i'll fix this up, and i'll be in good shape.
