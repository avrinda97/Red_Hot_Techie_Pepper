2007-09-06T05:57:00.000Z	bascule	gonzoism	.config goes in the /usr/src/linux-<version> dir not headers
2007-09-06T05:57:00.000Z	gonzoism	bascule	how do i get that ?  cause kernel-package installs that headers dir.  its like 56m big...  so i think its really the kernel.  maybe ?  i dunno
2007-09-06T05:58:00.000Z	bascule	gonzoism	I always build vanilla kernels, distro kernels don't recompile well in my experience
2007-09-06T05:59:00.000Z	gonzoism	bascule	  yeah, i'm trying to get it to quit freezing then get the patch to ubuntu people
2007-09-06T05:59:00.000Z	bascule	gonzoism	kernel patches, good luck
2007-09-06T06:02:00.000Z	gonzoism	bascule	  you do vanilla kernels ?   i think that might be the way i'll go just to get some progress.. i've been stuck for a week for a lack of info.  or at least understandable info.     i guess i can grab the kernel from the archive, and use the config from /boot/config-'uname -r'   and patch and then what ?  i've never did the initrd.gz thing...  mind laying it out for me /
2007-09-06T06:05:00.000Z	gonzoism	bascule	  cool,  i've been building them since 2.4.0, mind helping me out with this one ?   i just have no knowledge of this initrd.gz thing
2007-09-06T06:07:00.000Z	bascule	gonzoism	I will skim mkinitramfs and see ... hang on
2007-09-06T06:07:00.000Z	gonzoism	bascule	  thanks a bunch :)
2007-09-06T06:11:00.000Z	bascule	gonzoism	it seems easy enough
2007-09-06T06:13:00.000Z	gonzoism	bascule	   you just mkinitramfs ?  or what ?
2007-09-06T06:13:00.000Z	bascule	gonzoism	well add things to /etc/initramfs-tools/modules
2007-09-06T06:14:00.000Z	gonzoism	bascule	  lol,  i bet this is going to be fun.   i think i'm gonna have to find a howto.  :)
2007-09-06T06:14:00.000Z	gonzoism	bascule	  thanks for the encouragement. :)
2007-09-06T06:15:00.000Z	bascule	gonzoism	just put rootfs and IDE/SATA drivers as * instead of <M> and take ir from there
2007-09-06T06:15:00.000Z	gonzoism	bascule	  that is all that the initrd.gz was for,  to get access to the modules ?
2007-09-06T06:17:00.000Z	gonzoism	bascule	  hell.  i would have rebuilt fedora kernels a long time ago if i knew i could have just bypassed initrd.gz
2007-09-06T06:17:00.000Z	gonzoism	bascule	  thanks.
