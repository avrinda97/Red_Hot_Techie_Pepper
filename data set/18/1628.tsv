2011-01-16T10:31:00.000Z	Danny78_		I installed new ram in ubuntu server and now I have no video
2011-01-16T10:32:00.000Z	Danny78_		Is it possible to update mobo bios through wine?
2011-01-16T10:33:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	Danny78_	I don't think that would be safe imo
2011-01-16T10:34:00.000Z	Danny78_	psycho_oreos	 is there a way to natively update mobo bios?
2011-01-16T10:35:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	Danny78_	not really, not unless if the mobo manufacturer does have flashing using linux method. I had to flash using liveUSB + FreeDOS + DOS flasher tool
2011-01-16T10:35:00.000Z	Danny78_	psycho_oreos	 can you help me or point me to how to do this?
2011-01-16T10:36:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	Danny78_	is the bios flasher tool you got relies on DOS or does it actually require GUI interface?
2011-01-16T10:39:00.000Z	Danny78_	psycho_oreos	 checking...  (running on 256 MB RAM)  slooooq
2011-01-16T10:39:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	Danny78_	huh?
2011-01-16T10:40:00.000Z	Danny78_	psycho_oreos	 checking to see if it needs GUI to flash
2011-01-16T10:40:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	Danny78_	usually the motherboard website would detail that
2011-01-16T10:45:00.000Z	Danny78_	psycho_oreos	 for liveusb, is freedos the type of liveusb I need to create?
2011-01-16T10:47:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	Danny78_	yes but I don't know of any guides off hand to make it work, I had use grub4dos and then loaded freeDOS iso image onto flash drive so that it would boot. You might find it a little easier if you could burn freeDOS iso onto maybe a CD or something
2011-01-16T11:21:00.000Z	Danny78_	psycho_oreos	 ASUS actually offers it's software for linux
2011-01-16T11:21:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	Danny78_	I meant in terms of BIOS flashing, I know Gigabyte didn't they only had DOS flasher tools
2011-01-16T11:24:00.000Z	Danny78_	psycho_oreos	 I'm confused.  Do I still boot the ubuntu computer from a flash drive with freedos to upgrade the bios?
2011-01-16T11:26:00.000Z	Danny78_	psycho_oreos	 the flash utility is an .exe, so I'm assuming the answer is yes
2011-01-16T11:27:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	Danny78_	no, you need to find out how does the flasher works, if the flasher is windows only tool (which means that it has GUI) you cannot use freeDOS. If the flasher tool is DOS based you can use FreeDOS to flash the BIOS which can be done either by burning a copy of freeDOS onto CD or using USB in addition with grub4dos. Otherwise if they have linux flasher tool, then I use that by all means
