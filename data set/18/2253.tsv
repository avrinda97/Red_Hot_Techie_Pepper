2010-07-07T10:59:00.000Z	Chikokishi		Iflema, No I just started using it today, I wanted ot reinstall But when i tried it told me this system doesnt have an OS on it and wanted to use the entire hd.  I have Windows on here also, i would rather just format the partition i made for Ubuntu
2010-07-07T11:00:00.000Z	coz_	Chikokishi	 is this a single hard drive that has been partitioned or 2 drives
2010-07-07T11:01:00.000Z	Chikokishi		This is a single hard drive, When i installed Windows i partitioned off some space for Ubuntu, which i installed Ubuntu on.  When i tried to reinstall it jsut now it showed me like 8 different places in the partitioner, And it told me i didnt have an OS.
2010-07-07T11:05:00.000Z	Chikokishi		Iflema? coz_?
2010-07-07T11:06:00.000Z	coz_	Chikokishi	  so this is a single hard drive that has been partitioned... it is going to be difficutlt to format that partition by itself unless you use the live cd or alternate or minimal install cd
2010-07-07T11:06:00.000Z	coz_	Chikokishi	 there are utilities that "may" format a single partition but I have not seen any or tried any that work
2010-07-07T11:06:00.000Z	Chikokishi		I have an Ubuntu cd.. is that it?
2010-07-07T11:06:00.000Z	coz_	Chikokishi	yes
2010-07-07T11:07:00.000Z	Chikokishi	coz_	i will go into that partitioner and ill come back and tell you what i have there.  Perhaps that will help.
2010-07-07T11:07:00.000Z	coz_	Chikokishi	 put that into the cdrom... first click the   Check cd  option to be sure the cd itself is not corrupted
2010-07-07T11:07:00.000Z	coz_	Chikokishi	 then  go ahead and run the live cd
2010-07-07T11:07:00.000Z	Chikokishi		Like go into ubuntu with the cd? now go into the installer?
2010-07-07T11:08:00.000Z	Chikokishi		not*
2010-07-07T11:08:00.000Z	coz_	Chikokishi	  well first check the cd  with the check cd option
2010-07-07T11:08:00.000Z	Chikokishi		yeah
2010-07-07T11:08:00.000Z	coz_	Chikokishi	 if that works then go ahead and try the intstall
2010-07-07T11:08:00.000Z	Chikokishi		Alright, ill come back here if i get issues.
2010-07-07T11:08:00.000Z	coz_	Chikokishi	 ok
