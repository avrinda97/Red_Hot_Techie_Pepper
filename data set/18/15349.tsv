2005-04-07T09:36:00.000Z	nmsa		it should support it by default, the qestion is: how to control my camera ? how to capture ?
2005-04-07T09:36:00.000Z	nmsa		I don't have the card in, but a diff. distro sure sees it, so I am sure ubuntu, sees it too
2005-04-07T09:38:00.000Z	nmsa		i will and let you know, :) 'thnx
2005-04-07T08:48:00.000Z	nmsa		I am thinking to by a new pc with AMD Opteron CPU, where can I find more info on linux on AMD or linux experience on AMD please ?
2005-04-07T08:48:00.000Z	Curalton	nmsa	#ubuntu-amd64 ?
2005-04-07T08:49:00.000Z	nmsa	Curalton	sure thing, what is the advantage of having a amnd64 as CPU? wil it be really a sensible diff ?
2005-04-07T08:49:00.000Z	Curalton	nmsa	faster, a lot
2005-04-07T08:50:00.000Z	nmsa		I will use this for video editing, probably in wind00ze
2005-04-07T08:50:00.000Z	nmsa	Curalton	where can I find some becnhmarks ?
2005-04-07T08:50:00.000Z	nmsa		I'll be happy to take a look
2005-04-07T08:51:00.000Z	Curalton	nmsa	uh, dont know for ubuntu. google for database stuff etc.
2005-04-07T08:51:00.000Z	Curalton	nmsa	but for normal desktop use a normal athlon64 should suffice
2005-04-07T08:53:00.000Z	nmsa	Curalton	I want more power, to feel it in my hands :) ... I ove ubuntu, is so much faster then mandrake, and so easy to setup and stuff ...
2005-04-07T08:53:00.000Z	Curalton	nmsa	opterons.. well, overkill imho :)
2005-04-07T08:54:00.000Z	nmsa		anyone does video capture in linux ? avi to DVD ?
2005-04-07T08:55:00.000Z	nmsa	Curalton	see, will buy one in a week ... I think I can get a brand new AMD and SATA 160G + 1G mem for less then 900 E + a SonicView 19'' LCD ... maybe I will ask for discount ...
2005-04-07T08:56:00.000Z	Curalton	nmsa	sweet for sure. but also check about linux compatibility of the components, sometimes an issue with these brand new hardware parts
2005-04-07T08:56:00.000Z	nmsa	Curalton	I will, thnx for the tip ;)
