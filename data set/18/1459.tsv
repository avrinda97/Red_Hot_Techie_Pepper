2011-02-20T02:54:00.000Z	J697		Ok, a really old computer of mine(only has a 60 GB hard drive) has a big problem. I installed Ubuntu 10.04 LTS and everything seems well and good, although I can't use wireless and I connected the ethernet cable and then tried to install updates and it did not work! It gave me a error of some sort when it was installing (it downloaded it fine) and I went to Disk Utility and it said "The disk has a few bad sectors", I scrolled down and it said "value: 1", so I
2011-02-20T02:54:00.000Z	J697		am guessing that there are one bad sector(s), whatever that means and I am wondering is wireless possible for this computer?

2011-02-20T02:57:00.000Z	J697	bc81	ok rebooting now
2011-02-20T03:08:00.000Z	bc81	J697	i believe he's asking specifics (make, model...that sort of thing)
2011-02-20T03:08:00.000Z	J697	bc81	well then I don't have a clue
2011-02-20T03:09:00.000Z	J697	bc81	I ran that command
2011-02-20T03:15:00.000Z	J697	bc81	would I have better luck with internet on a smaller linux variant?
2011-02-20T03:18:00.000Z	bc81	J697	not necessarily, it will be more hassle in the long run.  run this and see if you have any blocks >> rfkill list
2011-02-20T03:19:00.000Z	J697	bc81	I got "0: phy0: Wireless LAN Soft blocked: no Hard blocked: no"
2011-02-20T03:21:00.000Z	J697	bc81	I got "0: phy0: Wireless LAN Soft blocked: no Hard blocked: no"
2011-02-20T03:22:00.000Z	bc81	J697	sorry, i can't help you.  try the forums, you might have better luck there
