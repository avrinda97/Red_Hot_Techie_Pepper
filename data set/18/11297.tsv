2006-08-16T14:25:00.000Z	FirstStrike		it boots about twice as fast
2006-08-16T14:25:00.000Z	FirstStrike		and runs noticeably quicker
2006-08-16T14:26:00.000Z	FirstStrike		there's a guide on the 2nd page of the how-to forum that walks you through getting adn compiling the kernel
2006-08-16T14:26:00.000Z	FirstStrike		it's cake
2006-08-16T14:26:00.000Z	FirstStrike		make sure you read though..there's a bit of into around page 11 that you will need otherwise it won't compile.
2006-08-16T14:28:00.000Z	FirstStrike		that's the one
2006-08-16T14:29:00.000Z	FirstStrike		it's pretty much just copy and paste into a terminal the whole time
2006-08-16T14:29:00.000Z	FirstStrike		if you follow that guide 100% it won't break your box
2006-08-16T14:31:00.000Z	FirstStrike		well, permissions are always an issue RamiKassab especially when dealing with the web.
2006-08-16T14:32:00.000Z	FirstStrike		but if you aren't going to publish anything with it and aren't too paranoid about permissions then that's fine.
2006-08-16T14:33:00.000Z	RamiKassab	FirstStrike	well this installation is just for local development, I dont want to have to do my web work as root in order to write files to the www directory
2006-08-16T14:33:00.000Z	RamiKassab	FirstStrike	how can I make it so that I can modify the www folder using my own account?
2006-08-16T14:33:00.000Z	FirstStrike	RamiKassab	use the chown command
2006-08-16T14:34:00.000Z	RamiKassab	FirstStrike	I understand that but is it ok for me just to make that folder writable by everyone?
2006-08-16T14:34:00.000Z	FirstStrike	RamiKassab	it won't hurt anything on the system, no.
2006-08-16T14:35:00.000Z	RamiKassab	FirstStrike	ok... in ubuntu, the primary user, is he part of the same group as root?
2006-08-16T14:37:00.000Z	RamiKassab	FirstStrike	ok so making the www folder writable by the group instead of everyone wont work then for the primary user
2006-08-16T14:37:00.000Z	FirstStrike	RamiKassab	yes. Bob:Bob
