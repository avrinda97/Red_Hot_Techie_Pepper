2009-06-03T12:32:00.000Z	TheFunkbomb	zortec	what video card do you have?
2009-06-03T12:33:00.000Z	zortec	TheFunkbomb	kabotinfo: I went with KDE and I want to install compiz effects like I did in gnome and my video card is NVIDIA nForce 610i/NVIDIA GeForce 7300
2009-06-03T12:34:00.000Z	TheFunkbomb	zortec	find hardware drivers
2009-06-03T12:36:00.000Z	zortec	TheFunkbomb	What do you mean install hardware drivers? I need to find the driver for my nvidia nforce 610i/7300 geforce chipset.  I remember that gnome picked it up and asked me to install it automatically when I turned on compiz
2009-06-03T12:36:00.000Z	TheFunkbomb	zortec	no, not install it.  Just activate the work around.
2009-06-03T12:37:00.000Z	zortec	TheFunkbomb	What is the workaround?
2009-06-03T12:37:00.000Z	TheFunkbomb	zortec	you remember in GNOME in System>Admin>Hardware Drivers?
2009-06-03T12:38:00.000Z	zortec	TheFunkbomb	It was easy in Gnome... I have no idea how it works in KDE
2009-06-03T12:38:00.000Z	TheFunkbomb	zortec	do you have the full on kubuntu installed?
2009-06-03T12:39:00.000Z	zortec	TheFunkbomb	Yes it is the full kubuntu-desktop
2009-06-03T12:40:00.000Z	TheFunkbomb	zortec	I don't know what to tell you.  This is an Ubuntu support channel.  I think there is a #kubuntu channel
2009-06-03T12:40:00.000Z	zortec	TheFunkbomb	There was no users in the #kubuntu channel
