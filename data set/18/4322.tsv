2011-06-29T06:15:00.000Z	spasysheep		does anyone here know the syntax of mkisofs well?
2011-06-29T06:17:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	spasysheep	what are you trying to do?
2011-06-29T06:18:00.000Z	spasysheep	ZykoticK9	I extracted a livecd ISO, edited a file, and now I want to rebuilt the files into a bootable ISO. The command I have makes an ISO, but it's not bootable
2011-06-29T06:19:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	spasysheep	perhaps try something like "mkisofs -o image.iso -b images/boot.img -c boot.cat -R -J -T /my/file/tree"
2011-06-29T06:19:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	spasysheep	i've never used it to create bootable images before sorry, the above is just in my ISO notes.
2011-06-29T06:20:00.000Z	spasysheep		ZycoticK9: what does the -c do?
2011-06-29T06:20:00.000Z	ZykoticK9		!tab > spasysheep
2011-06-29T06:20:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	spasysheep	i'm really not sure - i'm still working on installing it ;)
2011-06-29T06:21:00.000Z	spasysheep	ZykoticK9	I typed Zyc and was wondering why tab-complete wasn't working >.<
2011-06-29T06:21:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	spasysheep	thus, i have no man page - it's like i'm blind
2011-06-29T06:21:00.000Z	spasysheep	ZykoticK9	http://linux.die.net/man/8/mkisofs
2011-06-29T06:22:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	spasysheep	what did you install to get mkisofs?
2011-06-29T06:22:00.000Z	spasysheep	ZykoticK9	I don't know, when I started trying to do this it was already there. try iso-tools or something?
2011-06-29T06:23:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	spasysheep	i was surprise it's not in dvd+rw-tools
2011-06-29T06:23:00.000Z	spasysheep	ZykoticK9	packages.ubuntu.org says it's in genisoimage
2011-06-29T06:24:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	spasysheep	i already have that installed - sorry i can't help sorry.
2011-06-29T06:25:00.000Z	spasysheep	ZykoticK9	damn :(
2011-06-29T06:27:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	spasysheep	mystery solved - Debian uses genisoimage instead.  Sorry I'm REALLY no help to you - good luck!
