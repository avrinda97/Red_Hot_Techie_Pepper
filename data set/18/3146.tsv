2009-11-30T16:51:00.000Z	dsample		I'm attempting to create an AMD64 Alternate USB Stick installer (from Windows), but the guide on actualreality.wordpress.com doesn't seem to work, it gives an error when it does 'scan hard drives for an installer ISO image'
2009-11-30T16:52:00.000Z	dsample		The error message it gives is "Error while running 'modprobe -v yenta_socket'
