2008-06-26T07:22:00.000Z	barslow		sudo rm doesnt allow me to delete "directories"
2008-06-26T07:22:00.000Z	barslow		i can do that
2008-06-26T07:23:00.000Z	barslow		poprocks: from the .Trash directory?
2008-06-26T07:25:00.000Z	barslow		using sudo nautilus worked :)
2008-06-26T07:25:00.000Z	barslow		thanks for the help
2008-06-26T07:26:00.000Z	barslow		ok, i still have issues with the trash tho, when its deleting stuff the progress bar freezes
2008-06-26T07:26:00.000Z	spoon_man	barslow	when using a graphical app, gksudo is better -- use sudo for apps that don't use the CLI -- just for future reference :)
2008-06-26T07:26:00.000Z	barslow		thanks spoonman
2008-06-26T07:26:00.000Z	spoon_man	barslow	er use sudo for apps that DO use only the CLI...
2008-06-26T07:27:00.000Z	barslow		well i dont know what CLI is
2008-06-26T07:27:00.000Z	barslow		so ill just stick with gksudo i guess
2008-06-26T07:27:00.000Z	spoon_man		!cli | barslow
2008-06-26T07:27:00.000Z	barslow		haha oh
2008-06-26T07:28:00.000Z	barslow		in that case im an expert in CLI
2008-06-26T07:28:00.000Z	barslow		i'm arguably the best CLI operator in NY
2008-06-26T07:28:00.000Z	barslow		what am i saying arguably, im the best
2008-06-26T07:29:00.000Z	spoon_man		well that's pretty cool, barslow -- I really dig the CLI myself; it kicks the ass of anything you could do in Windows
2008-06-26T07:30:00.000Z	barslow	spoon_man	i was being sarcastic, im a linux moron
