2009-04-20T16:25:00.000Z	dooglus		what's the package name for 'beep music player'?
2009-04-20T16:25:00.000Z	dooglus		!beep

2009-04-20T16:26:00.000Z	dooglus		!info bmp
2009-04-20T16:26:00.000Z	dooglus		thanks
2009-04-20T16:26:00.000Z	dooglus		Package bmpx is not available, but is referred to by another package.
2009-04-20T16:26:00.000Z	dooglus		what did I do wrong?
2009-04-20T16:27:00.000Z	koshar1	dooglus	a new fork on bmp is audacious
2009-04-20T16:27:00.000Z	dooglus	koshar1	bmpx is fine for me - but I can't find it
2009-04-20T16:27:00.000Z	dooglus		!universe
2009-04-20T16:28:00.000Z	koshar1	dooglus	i think you will find that its been replaced by audacious
2009-04-20T16:29:00.000Z	dooglus	koshar1	ok, thanks.  that's installing.  what about 'tor' - I get the same message for that.  has that also been replaced by somethinG
2009-04-20T16:29:00.000Z	dooglus		?
2009-04-20T16:30:00.000Z	koshar1	dooglus	i dont know of tor
2009-04-20T16:31:00.000Z	dooglus	koshar1	it's short for 'the onion router' - it anonymises your net connection via a chain of proxies
2009-04-20T16:31:00.000Z	dooglus		!info tor
2009-04-20T16:32:00.000Z	koshar1	dooglus	ok iam aware of the app now, but havnt used it so far
2009-04-20T16:41:00.000Z	dooglus	koshar1	it seems to not be available in the jaunty repos - or it's been renamed maybe
