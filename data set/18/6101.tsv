2008-07-09T12:45:00.000Z	djhash	rand0m	a quick way to find out.. you can "locate filename"..
2008-07-09T12:45:00.000Z	djhash	rand0m	for example for xchat... try "locate xchat-gnome"
2008-07-09T12:48:00.000Z	djhash	rand0m	it usually depends on the app you're looking for.. for example xchat-gnome is in "/usr/bin"
2008-07-09T12:49:00.000Z	djhash	rand0m	have you tried what i told you?!
2008-07-09T12:50:00.000Z	rand0m	djhash	im just really tired and confused.  im used to the simplicity of just dragging and dropping.  all this ¨command¨ and searching for icons is just frustrating me into bedtime mode.
2008-07-09T12:50:00.000Z	djhash	rand0m	also if the program you want is in the Applications menu.. you simply right click on the icon and click add to panel or desktop
2008-07-09T12:51:00.000Z	rand0m	djhash	when i right-click, it just opens the programs
2008-07-09T12:53:00.000Z	djhash	rand0m	Shooooo: you know.. i just actually tried drag and drop on the panel and it worked!!!!!
2008-07-09T12:55:00.000Z	djhash	rand0m	try what Shooooo said.. right click on the panel.. and click add to panel.. then click on add from application launcher
2008-07-09T12:57:00.000Z	djhash	rand0m	there should be two launcher selections.. one is custom, the other is a simple gui that would list you everything in the Applications menu...
2008-07-09T13:10:00.000Z	djhash	rand0m	can you do this.. right click on an empty spot in panel.. click Add to panel.. then take a screenshot.. and upload it using http://imageshack.us/  then give me the link so I can see what you see..
2008-07-09T13:21:00.000Z	rand0m	djhash	sure ill take a screenshot.. can you tell me how ?
2008-07-09T13:22:00.000Z	djhash	rand0m	Applications -> Accessories -> take screenshot
2008-07-09T13:23:00.000Z	rand0m	djhash	i dont see that option int he menu.. not sure if you saw when i mentioned earlier than im using xfce right now
2008-07-09T13:23:00.000Z	djhash	rand0m	OH!!.. no.. i didn't..
2008-07-09T13:24:00.000Z	djhash	rand0m	hold on a sec.. let me switch my laptop to xfce and maybe walk you through some stuff..
2008-07-09T13:25:00.000Z	rand0m	djhash	k cool that´d be awesome. thanks dude
2008-07-09T13:41:00.000Z	djhash	rand0m	it seems like using Xfce is a lot of trouble if you dont want to use the terminal to find where the program resides..  when you click on launcher.. there is an entry for command and then there is browse next to it.. when you hit browse.. you need to go to Filesystem->usr->bin... however if you have a slow computer and not much ram.. that folder has close to 2000 files.. depending on how much stuff you have installed..
