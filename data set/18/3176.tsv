2010-01-01T09:57:00.000Z	Drunkpunk1		nothing with chmod has worked so far
2010-01-01T09:57:00.000Z	Drunkpunk1		weird yeh i though it would be that easy too but obv i doin something wrong
2010-01-01T09:58:00.000Z	Drunkpunk1		whats the diff between chmod and chown?
2010-01-01T09:59:00.000Z	tvaughn	Drunkpunk1	what exactly are you trying to do?

2010-01-01T10:06:00.000Z	Drunkpunk1	tvaughn	seems like mty prob is coming from not being able to actually REACH these folders in terminal
2010-01-01T10:08:00.000Z	Drunkpunk1	tvaughn	its w/out spaces cos i took them out in case that was confusing cli
2010-01-01T10:10:00.000Z	tvaughn	Drunkpunk1	yup same with spaces too
2010-01-01T10:11:00.000Z	tvaughn	Drunkpunk1	i cant call myself an expert either so :P
2010-01-01T10:11:00.000Z	tvaughn	Drunkpunk1	im looking into chmod being able to handle that
2010-01-01T10:13:00.000Z	tvaughn	Drunkpunk1	not a problem
2010-01-01T10:16:00.000Z	tvaughn	Drunkpunk1	try chmod -Rv 777 *.mp3
