2004-10-04T15:21:00.000Z	joem		what else besides some basic ide modules would be needed for ubuntu to detect my cdroms
2004-10-04T15:23:00.000Z	Kamion	joem	hopefully nothing, the installer should have everything it needs in the initrd ...
2004-10-04T15:23:00.000Z	joem	Kamion	it didn't..I used net install and have an sata hard disk if that would effect it
2004-10-04T15:23:00.000Z	Kamion	joem	entirely possible. what chipset?
2004-10-04T15:25:00.000Z	Kamion	joem	hm, I have some discover1 patches queued for i915, may be similar
2004-10-04T15:25:00.000Z	Kamion	joem	do you have a full Linux installation elsewhere on that box?
2004-10-04T15:26:00.000Z	Kamion	joem	ok, please switch to tty2 and type 'cut -f1,2 /proc/bus/pci/devices'
2004-10-04T15:26:00.000Z	Kamion	joem	mail that to me (cjwatson@canonical.com)
2004-10-04T15:26:00.000Z	Kamion	joem	you'll have to transcribe it I'm afraid, but it's not too long
2004-10-04T15:27:00.000Z	Kamion	joem	if you have a full Ubuntu install on the same machine, mail me the output of 'lspci' and 'lspci -n'
2004-10-04T15:30:00.000Z	Kamion	joem	does 'lsmod' display ata_piix?
2004-10-04T15:32:00.000Z	Kamion	joem	any relevant errors in /var/log/messages or /var/log/syslog?
2004-10-04T15:55:00.000Z	Kamion	joem	hm, possible, I've stuck that in the bug
2004-10-13T06:49:00.000Z	Kamion	joem	our toolchain isn't that significantly differemt from Debian's
2004-10-13T06:49:00.000Z	joem	Kamion	was talking about difference between ubuntu and gentoo
2004-10-13T06:50:00.000Z	Kamion	joem	ah, the discussion above was mixed-up, couldn't quite tell
2004-10-25T15:06:00.000Z	Kamion	joem	actually I think the PuTTY terminal's much better than gnome-terminal
2004-10-25T15:06:00.000Z	Kamion	joem	of course, as the Debian putty maintainer I'm a little biased
