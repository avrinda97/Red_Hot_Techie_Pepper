2007-06-24T05:19:00.000Z	dotpavan	debaserdz	server seems to be down (non-responsive to ping requests)
2007-06-24T05:19:00.000Z	debaserdz	dotpavan	the server is ficticious
2007-06-24T05:19:00.000Z	dotpavan	debaserdz	:D

2007-06-24T05:20:00.000Z	dotpavan	debaserdz	the admin might have filtered some connections
2007-06-24T05:21:00.000Z	debaserdz	dotpavan	it seem it
2007-06-24T05:21:00.000Z	debaserdz	dotpavan	i thought that there was a problem with my pc
2007-06-24T05:23:00.000Z	debaserdz	dotpavan	is possible that administrator have banned all ips except from office
2007-06-24T05:23:00.000Z	debaserdz	dotpavan	i have make a vpn with my office
2007-06-24T05:23:00.000Z	dotpavan	debaserdz	possible, as someone suggested above.., some univs also employ these mechanisms
