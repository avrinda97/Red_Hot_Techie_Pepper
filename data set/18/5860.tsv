2008-08-29T02:46:00.000Z	carandraug	bofh80	cernex: if you're having problems with spanish I may give a hand. I'm portuguese which is quite similar to spanish
2008-08-29T02:46:00.000Z	bofh80	carandraug	hee needs to do as he posted above, but he can't translate back from english
2008-08-29T02:56:00.000Z	bofh80	carandraug	if he's in the sound menu, does he see the sound events etc, that all say AUTODETECT
2008-08-29T02:57:00.000Z	bofh80	carandraug	in that sound menu, can't you see drop down boxes, that you acn select the USB in ?
2008-08-29T02:58:00.000Z	carandraug	bofh80	no. In my version, there's no drop down box to choose anything with USB
2008-08-29T02:58:00.000Z	bofh80	carandraug	sure, but he has it plugged in - so it should be in the list . .
2008-08-29T02:58:00.000Z	bofh80	carandraug	as c-media or somit, who knows .
2008-08-29T02:59:00.000Z	carandraug	bofh80	oh. Ok
2008-08-29T03:01:00.000Z	carandraug	bofh80	prueba
2008-08-29T03:04:00.000Z	carandraug	bofh80	I'm not sure. But it makes sense that way.
2008-08-29T03:11:00.000Z	bofh80	carandraug	he aint back yet, you reckon that's a good sign or a bad sign. heheheh
2008-08-29T03:12:00.000Z	carandraug	bofh80	I can see someone not coming back for both reasons. He may already be entertained
2008-08-29T03:12:00.000Z	bofh80	carandraug	yer, or he's bashing his tft with his usb headset
2008-08-29T03:14:00.000Z	carandraug	bofh80	cernex: well, the menu changed. It may be somewhere else now
2008-08-29T03:14:00.000Z	carandraug	bofh80	cernex: if only we knew what configuration files that options edited back then. That's unlikely to change
