2008-08-27T21:13:00.000Z	nnull	digifuzz	id need to open an additional windows for that correct?
2008-08-27T21:14:00.000Z	digifuzz	nnull	you cant type in the current terminal window?  if the program you started steals focuz, hit CTRL+Z in the current window.  at that point, you can probably just <kill %1>
2008-08-27T21:15:00.000Z	nnull	digifuzz	it doesnt steal focus, just nothing happens when i type it, ive got no :~
2008-08-27T21:15:00.000Z	digifuzz	nnull	hit ctrl+z what happens?
2008-08-27T21:16:00.000Z	digifuzz	nnull	in the terminal, i mean.
2008-08-27T21:16:00.000Z	nnull	digifuzz	[1]+  Stopped
2008-08-27T21:16:00.000Z	digifuzz	nnull	type "kill %1"
2008-08-27T21:17:00.000Z	nnull	digifuzz	bash: kill: (14431) - Operation not permitted
2008-08-27T21:17:00.000Z	digifuzz	nnull	hmm..
2008-08-27T21:23:00.000Z	nnull	digifuzz	when i type ps aux it fills my screen i cant see them all
2008-08-27T21:23:00.000Z	digifuzz	nnull	ps aux | less
2008-08-27T21:25:00.000Z	nnull	digifuzz	is it normal to have so many things here?
2008-08-27T21:25:00.000Z	digifuzz	nnull	yeah, since you're running it as root, you see the entire system's processes running
2008-08-27T21:26:00.000Z	nnull	digifuzz	the processes PID im wanting to kill is 14431 lol.. does that mean i haveto type kill %14431 ?
2008-08-27T21:27:00.000Z	digifuzz	nnull	yeah, but since you ran it as root originally, you have to type "sudo kill -KILL 14431"
2008-08-27T21:29:00.000Z	digifuzz	nnull	but at this point you went ahead and found the pid, so just do it that way. :)
2008-08-27T21:29:00.000Z	digifuzz	nnull	haha, sure.
2008-08-27T21:30:00.000Z	digifuzz	nnull	You could have done this: ps aux | grep <cmd.name>
