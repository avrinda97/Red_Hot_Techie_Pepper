2007-02-15T16:09:00.000Z	xstasi		i don't want to download all the 650 MB..
2007-02-15T06:49:00.000Z	xstasi		hi
2007-02-15T06:50:00.000Z	xstasi		since i can't boot ubuntu cd, can i install ubuntu from my running debian?
2007-02-15T06:50:00.000Z	xstasi		like with debootstrap or something
2007-02-15T06:50:00.000Z	johns^	xstasi	you can netboot
2007-02-15T06:53:00.000Z	johns^	xstasi	there is a debian howto for installing through a network
2007-02-15T06:55:00.000Z	johns^	xstasi	netboot, then add a grub entry so it boots mentioned setup files and install is on it's way as usual
2007-02-15T06:55:00.000Z	xstasi	johns^	i only have a single computer.. can i netboot?
2007-02-15T06:59:00.000Z	johns^	xstasi	ttp://www.debian.org/releases/woody/i386/ch-install-methods.en.html#s-boot-drive-files
2007-02-15T07:00:00.000Z	johns^	xstasi	as I said, use the ubuntu files and the idea is the same
2007-02-15T07:00:00.000Z	xstasi	johns^	i'm right now trying to debootstrap from here
2007-02-15T07:00:00.000Z	johns^	xstasi	you put them somewhere and tell grub or lilo to boot those files
2007-02-15T07:01:00.000Z	johns^	xstasi	it's like a tftp boot. I use that to install fedora/debian/ubuntu on desktop pc's
2007-02-15T07:01:00.000Z	xstasi	johns^	ok, but my cd is ok. it's xorg that won't start because of the unsupported video card
2007-02-15T07:05:00.000Z	johns^	xstasi	and there is a manual :)
2007-02-15T07:14:00.000Z	johns^	xstasi	apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
