2006-11-04T06:56:00.000Z	chadswill		heyas.. i have installed both vmware-player and server..now it seems that installs are broken..and i want to remove the player.. sudo apt-get remove vmware-player only gives errors..E: Sub-process /usr/bin/dpkg returned an error code (1)... and if trying to install new stuff i get: E: dpkg was interrupted, you must manually run 'dpkg --configure -a' to correct the problem.
2006-11-04T06:57:00.000Z	Fry3001	chadswill	what is the excact error. iirc you can't install both
2006-11-04T06:58:00.000Z	Fry3001	chadswill	there should be an error message above the dpkg error code
2006-11-04T06:59:00.000Z	Fry3001	chadswill	the vmware-player init script could not be started. It is started due to complete vmware-config.pl
2006-11-04T07:00:00.000Z	Fry3001	chadswill	workaround (not nice, but it works..) : remove the /etc/init.d/vmware-player script and set a link named /etc/init.d/vmware-player to /bin/true
2006-11-04T07:00:00.000Z	Fry3001	chadswill	then remove vmware-player, and after that remove the link
2006-11-04T07:01:00.000Z	Fry3001	chadswill	of course only if you want to use the server after that :) But there must be a vmware-like solution elsewhere
2006-11-04T07:02:00.000Z	chadswill	Fry3001	 and set a link named /etc/init.d/vmware-player to /bin/true   explain a little..heh
2006-11-04T07:03:00.000Z	Fry3001	chadswill	easy... the start action will always pass, so the configure job runs, and vmware player will be removed
2006-11-04T07:03:00.000Z	Fry3001	chadswill	you have to unload the kernel modules manually (i.e. reboot)
2006-11-04T07:04:00.000Z	Fry3001	chadswill	/bin/true is a file that always results in a success, so the dpkg -configure works. After that, the link in /etc/init.d could be removed
2006-11-04T07:04:00.000Z	Fry3001	chadswill	as i said, just a workaround, but it works. i use the player at several stations, and it couses errors sometimes
2006-11-04T07:11:00.000Z	chadswill	Fry3001	how and where do i set a link to /bin/true ?  im kinda new to this..heh
2006-11-04T07:12:00.000Z	Fry3001	chadswill	ln -s /bin/true /etc/init.d/vmware-player
2006-11-04T07:13:00.000Z	Fry3001	chadswill	you just make a symbolic link to /bin/true
2006-11-04T07:13:00.000Z	Fry3001	chadswill	that results in the success of the init script (which is your problem)
2006-11-04T07:13:00.000Z	Fry3001	chadswill	you have to remove/move the script first
2006-11-04T07:14:00.000Z	Fry3001	chadswill	mv /etc/init.d/vmware-player /etc/init.d/vmware-player.bak
