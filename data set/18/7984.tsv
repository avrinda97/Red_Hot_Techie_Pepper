2008-04-28T15:39:00.000Z	garu		hi everyone
2008-04-28T15:41:00.000Z	garu		why is that when I open firefox, my 2 cores in the computer start working at 80/90%?
2008-04-28T15:42:00.000Z	garu		I thought ubuntu was supposed to run smoothly in even a not so powerful computer, and I got a powerful one!
2008-04-28T15:42:00.000Z	lassegul	garu	it is firefox that uses your cpus?
2008-04-28T15:43:00.000Z	garu	lassegul	yep, because I got the system monitor opened, and if I kill firefox, it goes down to 10%, but as soon as I open it, it fires up to 80/90%.
2008-04-28T15:46:00.000Z	garu	lassegul	how do I run it from the terminal?
2008-04-28T15:46:00.000Z	lassegul	garu	open terminal - type in firefox
2008-04-28T15:46:00.000Z	lassegul	garu	or is it firefox-3.0 ? try
2008-04-28T15:49:00.000Z	garu	lassegul	nah...,nothing out of the ordinary when run firefox from the terminal
2008-04-28T15:51:00.000Z	lassegul	garu	ok. then install firefox 2 and use that instead. firefox 3 beta 5 is very stable for 99% of the users, but it still is beta softwar
2008-04-28T15:51:00.000Z	garu	lassegul	yeah, I just started doing that....I'll wait a bit more for the 3 one!
2008-04-28T15:52:00.000Z	garu	lassegul	maybe it'll get better after some updates
2008-04-28T15:55:00.000Z	lassegul	garu	it probably will, but in the meantime, yuo cant have a browser taht uses 90% of your cpu. try epiphany, its a good browser, default for gnome.
2008-04-28T15:56:00.000Z	garu	lassegul	yeah...do u think version 2.0 wont do?does epiphany supports divx? :s
2008-04-28T15:57:00.000Z	lassegul	garu	i think firefox 2 will do. but epiphany handles divx in the same way firefox does (does very well), calls in totem to play it for you.
2008-04-28T15:58:00.000Z	garu	lassegul	humn...I didnt even know about this browser, I only knew about opera and firefox.lol!thanks man, I'll give it a go ;)
2008-04-28T15:58:00.000Z	lassegul	garu	good luck.
2008-04-28T15:58:00.000Z	garu	lassegul	thanks ;)
