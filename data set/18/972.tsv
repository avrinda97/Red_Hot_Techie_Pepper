2011-07-23T20:26:00.000Z	wh1zz0		Yeah thanks
2011-07-23T20:26:00.000Z	wh1zz0		Lol
2011-07-23T20:26:00.000Z	wh1zz0		Yeah..
2011-07-23T20:26:00.000Z	wh1zz0		Hmm
2011-07-23T20:26:00.000Z	Polah	wh1zz0	There is no root password. Sudo does not make you root, it just grants elevated privileges temporarily.
2011-07-23T20:27:00.000Z	Polah	wh1zz0	Correct. There is no root password for  you to log on with.
2011-07-23T20:28:00.000Z	Polah	wh1zz0	Except more effective at privilege control.
2011-07-23T20:29:00.000Z	wh1zz0	Polah	Right.. thanks guys
2011-10-24T16:43:00.000Z	Polah	wh1zz0	you may have to register on the network to get into #php. Ask in #freenode about how to do that.
2011-10-24T16:55:00.000Z	wh1zz0	Polah	Thanks for the tip  but im already registered on freenode and still cannot get in so I wonder why?
2011-10-24T16:55:00.000Z	Polah	wh1zz0	have you registered as being online since joining?
2011-10-24T16:55:00.000Z	Polah	wh1zz0	identified, that is.
2011-10-24T16:56:00.000Z	wh1zz0	Polah	Yes I have
2011-10-24T16:56:00.000Z	wh1zz0	Polah	Yes im registered and identified
2011-10-24T16:57:00.000Z	Polah	wh1zz0	maybe you're banned then.
2011-10-24T16:58:00.000Z	wh1zz0	Polah	 No I don't think i"m banned because each time I try to join it keeps telling me #php: Cannot join channel (+i) - you must be invited
