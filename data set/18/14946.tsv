2005-07-18T05:45:00.000Z	cmatheson	Ziggity	i haven't had any "issues"
2005-07-18T05:46:00.000Z	Ziggity	cmatheson	 : did you install from apt-get?
2005-07-18T05:46:00.000Z	cmatheson	Ziggity	no
2005-07-18T05:46:00.000Z	Ziggity	cmatheson	 : and what version
2005-07-18T05:46:00.000Z	cmatheson	Ziggity	i don't know... it's not on this box, i got it about a month ago
2005-07-18T05:47:00.000Z	Ziggity	cmatheson	: did u download or off a CD
2005-07-18T05:47:00.000Z	cmatheson	Ziggity	i downloaded it off of suns website
2005-07-18T05:47:00.000Z	cmatheson	Ziggity	it was bundled w/ the jdk
2005-07-18T05:49:00.000Z	Ziggity	cmatheson	: you can do c/c++ and c# as well in there? (  so i've heard - with the plug ins )
2005-07-18T05:50:00.000Z	cmatheson	Ziggity	i think so... i actually just use vim for my c/c++, but afaik you can do pretty much anything w/ it
2005-07-18T05:52:00.000Z	Ziggity	cmatheson	 : I'm struggling with c/c++ do you know where I can get a  free complete tutrial / online course ..
2005-07-18T05:53:00.000Z	cmatheson	Ziggity	hmm, i'm afraid i don't know... i just bought a book (c++ primer plus was excellent).  i think google would be your friend though
2005-07-18T05:53:00.000Z	Ziggity	cmatheson	 : do  you use it professionally .. can you suggest other tools I might find helpful?
2005-07-18T05:54:00.000Z	cmatheson	Ziggity	i don't know by what you mean "professionally"... i use it at work, but i'm a linux admin so that's not my primary responsibility (and i don't use it much), so vim/g++ are more than enough for me
2005-07-18T05:55:00.000Z	cmatheson	Ziggity	emacs is excellent too, if you're looking for more of an IDE, Kdevelop is supposed to be amazing, and then there is also gnome's anjuta (although it never rates as well as the kde stufF)
2005-07-18T05:55:00.000Z	Ziggity	cmatheson	 : thx.
