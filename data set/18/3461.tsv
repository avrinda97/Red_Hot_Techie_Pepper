2010-01-01T21:11:00.000Z	mhall119	christopheb	running Emerald?
2010-01-01T21:11:00.000Z	christopheb	mhall119	that's right
2010-01-01T21:11:00.000Z	mhall119	christopheb	is it only the window decorations that are giving a problem?
2010-01-01T21:12:00.000Z	christopheb	mhall119	no, my mouse is also very weird
2010-01-01T21:12:00.000Z	mhall119	christopheb	hmm, the mouse is usually rendered by the hardware, not X11, so it's probably a driver problem
2010-01-01T21:14:00.000Z	christopheb	mhall119	right now I'm running the open source drivers, they are fast, but they give me these weird icons
2010-01-01T21:15:00.000Z	mhall119	christopheb	what card?
2010-01-01T21:15:00.000Z	christopheb	mhall119	HD4850
2010-01-01T21:15:00.000Z	mhall119	christopheb	nvidia?
2010-01-01T21:16:00.000Z	christopheb	mhall119	ati
2010-01-01T21:16:00.000Z	mhall119	christopheb	yeah, I've had graphics clitches with the open source ati driver too
2010-01-01T21:17:00.000Z	christopheb	mhall119	so Installing the binary driver solves the glitches, but he's very slow
2010-01-01T21:17:00.000Z	mhall119	christopheb	slow, really?  I had to stop using it last year because ATI dropped support for my chipset
2010-01-01T21:18:00.000Z	christopheb	mhall119	for example, right now I can just scroll in firefox with flash and ads and whatever, minimize it without problems, with the binary drivers that's just so choppy
2010-01-01T21:18:00.000Z	mhall119	christopheb	huh, I had the opposite experience
2010-01-01T21:19:00.000Z	christopheb	mhall119	I installed them from the website of ATI, that's the correct binary driver right?
2010-01-01T21:19:00.000Z	mhall119	christopheb	maybe, I dunno
