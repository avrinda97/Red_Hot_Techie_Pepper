2007-09-01T06:54:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Esteth	did [you install 64bit?
2007-09-01T06:55:00.000Z	Esteth	IndyGunFreak	No. I don't like having issues with drivers and such on a 64bit OS, and only have 2GB of memory, so i don't really need 64bit at the moment
2007-09-01T06:55:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Esteth	someone hit yo9u with a common sense stick, huh?
2007-09-01T06:56:00.000Z	Esteth	IndyGunFreak	I don't understand what you mean, sorry.
2007-09-01T06:57:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Esteth	lol, just a bad joke on my part.
2007-09-01T07:17:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Esteth	yes, ther eis..
2007-09-01T07:18:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Esteth	its ok, we'll flog you later
2007-09-01T07:38:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Esteth	did you get compiz working?
2007-09-29T11:14:00.000Z	Esteth	IndyGunFreak	Thanks for the help anyway :)
2007-09-29T11:11:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Esteth	open aterminal and type "lspci" no quotes, and see how its identifying the device,.
2007-09-29T11:11:00.000Z	Esteth	IndyGunFreak	I get quite a few devices there. What should i look for? There is only one Network Controller listed, and that's my PCI Wireless card, not the integrated ethernet card
2007-09-29T11:12:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Esteth	then it would seem that whatever tyupe it is its not recognizing it.
2007-09-29T11:12:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Esteth	have you considered searching the net for card confirmed to work with Feisty, and buying a cheap $15 ethernet card?
2007-09-29T11:13:00.000Z	Esteth	IndyGunFreak	I've thought about it, but since this isn't really a critical issue(i want to bridge my ethernet connection to my wireless internet for Xbox live), even spending 15 is too much.
2007-09-29T11:14:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Esteth	i see.. sorry, i really xcan't help.
2007-10-13T07:25:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Esteth	and Usiu getdeb.net has Pidgin,b ut unfortunately, its outdated, and if you use MSN< it has a fairly serious security flaw.
2007-10-13T07:25:00.000Z	Esteth	IndyGunFreak	Hmm, i never knew that. Thanks for the heads-up.
2007-10-13T07:26:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Esteth	yeah, check http://www.pidgin.im its on the first page
