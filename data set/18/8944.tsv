2007-06-02T11:23:00.000Z	boiboi		erm, is it possible to resize a portion of my hardisk which is curretnly formatted with ntfs for ubuntu?
2007-06-02T11:24:00.000Z	qman	boiboi	yes, make sure your partition is defragged and you've shut down windows properly, then use gparted to resize it
2007-06-02T11:26:00.000Z	qman	boiboi	no, it will reduce the amount of free space on which ever partition you choose to resize
2007-06-02T11:27:00.000Z	qman	boiboi	and leave it free so you can install ubuntu in another partition
2007-06-02T11:28:00.000Z	qman	boiboi	none of the available linux filesystem types can be natively used by windows; however, if you use ext3, you can install a driver in windows to access it
2007-06-02T11:29:00.000Z	boiboi	qman	but, i think the installer doesn't have that...  TO:tiekyl, yes, i want to try ubuntu without sacrificing my files or windows
2007-06-02T11:35:00.000Z	qman	boiboi	that's simple, all you have to do is change a line in menu.lst
2007-06-02T11:36:00.000Z	qman	boiboi	change "default 0" to the number that windows is; the file is located in /boot/grub/
2007-06-02T11:36:00.000Z	qman	boiboi	you must use sudo, as it requires root permission
2007-06-02T11:36:00.000Z	qman	boiboi	the file is very well commented and should explain itself quite clearly
2007-06-02T11:37:00.000Z	qman	boiboi	the file is /boot/grub/menu.lst
2007-06-02T11:39:00.000Z	qman	boiboi	editing the file requires root access. I suggest you do the following:
2007-06-02T11:39:00.000Z	qman	boiboi	open a terminal (applicatoins - accessories - terminal), and type "gksudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst"
2007-06-02T11:40:00.000Z	qman	boiboi	then enter your password, edit the file, and save it
2007-06-02T11:43:00.000Z	qman	boiboi	yes, there are two options. You can either take ownership, or grant permissions to everyone on the locations
2007-06-02T11:43:00.000Z	qman	boiboi	to change permissions, use the chmod command. to change owners, use the chown command. the man pages for each should be very descriptive
2007-06-02T11:44:00.000Z	boiboi	qman	thanks
2007-06-02T11:44:00.000Z	qman	boiboi	no problem, hope you have a good experience :)
