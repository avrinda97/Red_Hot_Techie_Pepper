2009-12-14T12:10:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	eddiegentry	You install the computer yourself or somebody did it for you?  A friend, maybe?
2009-12-14T12:11:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	eddiegentry	It is likely that your friend pulled a prank on you.
2009-12-14T12:12:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	eddiegentry	When is the last time it occur?
2009-12-14T12:14:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	eddiegentry	Run "crontab -e" Do you see any commands?
2009-12-14T12:16:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	eddiegentry	Okay. Run "w" in the terminal.
2009-12-14T12:16:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	eddiegentry	Can you paste that?
2009-12-14T12:18:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	eddiegentry	We are not. Tell your friend to knock it off and you'll be okay.
