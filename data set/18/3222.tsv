2009-11-13T11:28:00.000Z	mandi628		i'm considering switching to ubuntu, but i have a program that i use for our homeschool recordkeeping and they do not currently support linus os - wine & codeweaver do not support the program either - what are my options?
2009-11-13T11:28:00.000Z	mandi628		sorry - hi, my name is mandi LOL
2009-11-13T11:28:00.000Z	Absenth	mandi628	have you tried running the app in codeweavers crossover office?
2009-11-13T11:28:00.000Z	Absenth	mandi628	I've seen a great number of apps not listed run fine.
2009-11-13T11:29:00.000Z	Absenth	mandi628	since ubuntu runs as a live cd, you could test it, including installing crossover office, without overwriting windows.
2009-11-13T11:30:00.000Z	mandi628	Absenth	i haven't switched yet, from what i understand, part of the problem is that the program heavily relies on .NET framework - does this matter?
2009-11-13T11:30:00.000Z	Absenth	mandi628	it does.  that doesn't mean it automatically won't run in crossover though.
2009-11-13T11:31:00.000Z	Absenth	mandi628	wireless I assume?
2009-11-13T11:31:00.000Z	Absenth	mandi628	any chance you can plug in an ethernet cable for testing? :)
2009-11-13T11:32:00.000Z	mandi628	Absenth	not on this computer, but my "server" is connected directly to the modem, so i could use that for testing
2009-11-13T11:32:00.000Z	mandi628	Absenth	that one is going to be my 100% linux machine, my others might have to be dual-booted
2009-11-13T11:33:00.000Z	Absenth	mandi628	wouldn't hurt to do testing on something you could afford to run linux on :)
2009-11-13T11:33:00.000Z	Absenth	mandi628	I dual booted for a couple of years before finally ditching windows all together. :)
2009-11-13T11:33:00.000Z	mandi628	Absenth	i've talked to several converts, also homeschoolers, and the only reason they still use windows is because of this program i speak of
2009-11-13T11:35:00.000Z	mandi628	Absenth	when i do a ful install on linux on my old desktop machine (the 100% linux machine), do i need to move the data to CDs, or just back them up in case something happens? how much of the data gets wiped in an os install?
2009-11-13T11:35:00.000Z	Absenth	mandi628	all of it.  I'd back up to storage you trust.  whether it's a USB drive, or whatever.
2009-11-13T11:38:00.000Z	Absenth	mandi628	if the machine isn't important.  install linux and run with it :)  test everything you think you might do with a main computer.  of course be sure to back up your data first.
2009-11-13T11:39:00.000Z	mandi628	Absenth	skinnypup, thanks for the input - i'll let you know how it turns out!
