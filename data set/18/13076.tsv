2006-01-25T16:43:00.000Z	Gunfus		hello, is there any easy GUI way to add folders that are shared by SMB in another computer.?
2006-01-25T16:44:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Gunfus	System > Administration > Shared Folders.
2006-01-25T16:44:00.000Z	Gunfus	tonyyarusso	that only seems to allow me to share my directories.. i want to add a already shared directory
2006-01-25T16:44:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Gunfus	Wait, that was to share them, to access is in places.
2006-01-25T16:45:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Gunfus	Places > Network Servers / Connect to Server
2006-01-25T16:45:00.000Z	Gunfus	tonyyarusso	Excellent thanks.. that is one places that I overlooked.
2006-01-27T11:54:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Gunfus	Of what?
2006-01-27T11:55:00.000Z	Gunfus	tonyyarusso	I want to dual boot with windows.. but I need a bootable disk so that i can overwrite the MBR after installing windows
2006-01-27T11:55:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Gunfus	Do you have a Live CD?
2006-01-27T11:55:00.000Z	Gunfus	tonyyarusso	yes
2006-01-27T11:56:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Gunfus	That seems to be the easiest way, since those are already a bootable disk for you.
2006-01-27T11:57:00.000Z	Gunfus	tonyyarusso	 right, but how do I load my already install Linux after botting with the CD?
2006-01-27T11:57:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Gunfus	Well, I'm not familiar with lilo, but !grub has some information for that, which you might be able to tweak for your situation.
2006-01-27T11:57:00.000Z	Gunfus	tonyyarusso	okay
2006-01-27T11:57:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Gunfus	Basically you can just mount and chroot, then write whatever you need to to the mbr.
2006-01-27T11:58:00.000Z	Gunfus	tonyyarusso	thanks man
2006-01-27T11:58:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	Gunfus	np.  (I've had to do it too.)
2006-01-27T11:58:00.000Z	Gunfus	tonyyarusso	hehe
