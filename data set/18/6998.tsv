2008-02-22T08:48:00.000Z	fredmv		_oz_: remember that SDL problem I was having?   Still clueless as to what to do... lol.     That's what I get for being a Windoze user for so long.
2008-02-22T08:48:00.000Z	fredmv		_oz_: this one: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=703137
2008-02-22T08:48:00.000Z	fredmv		_oz_: if you could lend any insight I'd really appreciate it... I think it's likely something very simple that I'm just not grasping.
2008-02-22T08:49:00.000Z	fredmv		Songbird is sweet.
2008-02-22T08:49:00.000Z	fredmv		it's a great example of Gecko/XUL
2008-02-22T08:49:00.000Z	fredmv		totally transparent
2008-02-22T08:49:00.000Z	wease|	fredmv	agreed!
2008-02-22T08:52:00.000Z	fredmv	wease|	 you do any XUL dev?
2008-02-22T08:53:00.000Z	wease|	fredmv	nah. i would if i were a full time programmer
2008-02-22T08:54:00.000Z	fredmv	wease|	 yeah, I've only done minimal stuff, but it's pretty easy.  what's cool about it is its minimal XML to get a GUI together, and then if you know JavaScript, you can make pretty robust, cross-platform apps.  Very overlooked stuff for many.
2008-02-22T08:56:00.000Z	wease|	fredmv	right on. i really like how mozilla has worked it out with their projects
2008-02-23T09:10:00.000Z	fredmv	wease|	you familar with mic input problems under Ubuntu?
2008-02-23T09:11:00.000Z	wease|	fredmv	like what? input issues?
2008-02-23T09:11:00.000Z	fredmv	wease|	Well, yeah.   I can get input but nothing captures output (well, except sound-recorder [command line sound recording app]).
2008-02-23T09:12:00.000Z	wease|	fredmv	so skype doesnt give output?
2008-02-23T09:12:00.000Z	wease|	fredmv	try akiga?
2008-02-23T09:12:00.000Z	fredmv	wease|	doesn't seem to... I was testing with echo123 and it doesn't seem to work.   But the weird thing is that not even gnome-sound-recorder can capture sound...
