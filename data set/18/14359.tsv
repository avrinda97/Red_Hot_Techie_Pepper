2005-08-25T07:13:00.000Z	glick	darkheart	yeah running more than one server
2005-08-25T07:14:00.000Z	darkheart	glick	What kind of server?
2005-08-25T07:14:00.000Z	darkheart	glick	No, that's what Linux is made for =) Running services haha.
2005-08-25T07:14:00.000Z	glick	darkheart	yeah but i mean is it generally to run multiple things on one server
2005-08-25T07:15:00.000Z	darkheart	glick	Yes, it is no problem to run multiple services.
2005-08-25T07:15:00.000Z	darkheart	glick	Of course, you have to take into account the box you are using and how much service you are providing.
2005-08-25T07:16:00.000Z	glick	darkheart	wouldnt be much, maybe a couple of people 10 max
2005-08-25T07:16:00.000Z	darkheart	glick	No problem at all.
2005-08-25T07:17:00.000Z	darkheart	glick	What are the specs on the box?
2005-08-25T07:17:00.000Z	glick	darkheart	1 gig of ram 850mhz cpu 150gig harddrive space across two disks,
2005-08-25T07:18:00.000Z	darkheart	glick	No problem at all. Overkill in fact =P
2005-08-25T07:18:00.000Z	darkheart	glick	Not really overkill, but that would be perfect for everything to run smooth.
2005-08-25T07:19:00.000Z	darkheart	glick	Np.
