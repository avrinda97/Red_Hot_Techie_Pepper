2007-03-24T11:15:00.000Z	Supercross		can someone help me figure out why ubuntu freezes up so much on me...its a fresh install and its frozen up over 10 times in a day....never any freezes in windows on same machine
2007-03-24T11:17:00.000Z	Supercross		how do I find out what is causing ubuntu to freeze on a fresh install on edgy?
2007-03-24T11:19:00.000Z	Supercross		does ubuntu support dual channel ram?
2007-03-24T11:20:00.000Z	atoponce	Supercross	yes
2007-03-24T11:23:00.000Z	atoponce	Supercross	run the memory check program on the live cd
2007-03-24T11:23:00.000Z	atoponce	Supercross	of course, put the ram in the slots closest to the cpu...
2007-03-24T11:25:00.000Z	Supercross	atoponce	is that true..try moving the ram to the slots closest to the cpu....i think its in 1,3 now to enable dual channel
2007-03-24T11:26:00.000Z	atoponce	Supercross	it could help, although might not. it's just something i learned going through a+ cert
2007-03-24T11:27:00.000Z	atoponce	Supercross	yeah. you might have bad ram. does your board support mem tests?
2007-03-24T11:27:00.000Z	atoponce	Supercross	mobo, that is?
2007-03-24T11:28:00.000Z	atoponce	Supercross	does it display key shortcuts as post?
2007-03-24T11:28:00.000Z	atoponce	Supercross	anything for mem test?
2007-03-24T11:32:00.000Z	atoponce	Supercross	a while
2007-03-24T11:32:00.000Z	atoponce	Supercross	it goes through random numbers, then reading/writing byte patters
2007-03-24T11:33:00.000Z	atoponce	Supercross	the last mem test i did, and this well obviously depend on your hardware, was about 30 minutes
2007-03-24T11:33:00.000Z	atoponce	Supercross	it was fairly new hardware
2007-03-24T11:34:00.000Z	atoponce	Supercross	can't recall if it's the overall, or just for that specific test
2007-03-24T11:35:00.000Z	atoponce	Supercross	nite
