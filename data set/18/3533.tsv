2012-09-01T23:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rohn	have you considered using 12.04 rather than 11.10? Precise is LTS and has a later kernel, drivers and Xorg. May help
2012-09-01T23:36:00.000Z	rohn	ActionParsnip	at first i used 12.04 but there was a problem
2012-09-01T23:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rohn	the default intel driver should be ok
2012-09-01T23:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rohn	its in the cog menu in the top right if memory serves?
2012-09-01T23:50:00.000Z	rohn	ActionParsnip	there is only suspend and shut down
2012-09-01T23:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rohn	try: sudo pm-hibernate
2012-09-01T23:57:00.000Z	rohn	ActionParsnip	:(
2012-09-02T00:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rohn	does the command work?
2012-09-02T08:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rohn	its possible but not advised or supported
2012-09-02T08:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	rohn	I suggest you find a ppa with the app
