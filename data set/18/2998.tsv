2010-01-08T08:49:00.000Z	Losha	FernandoF	we're listening....
2010-01-08T08:53:00.000Z	FernandoF	Losha	 Thx  ... Can you help? name of application  to get rid off "authentication required" blind message and get  a window for my password to get access to my windows HD under windows?
2010-01-08T08:54:00.000Z	Losha	FernandoF	actually, I'm having trouble understanding you. Have you tried #ubuntu-pt ?
2010-01-08T08:54:00.000Z	FernandoF	Losha	I will improve
2010-01-08T08:55:00.000Z	Losha	FernandoF	this channel is english only. What is your native language?
2010-01-08T08:59:00.000Z	FernandoF	Losha	there is an application missing on my startup, after i did disable it accidentally. this provokes the message "authentication is required" when i try to access my data hard disks, instead of a window to put authentication in. Do you know which application i shd put in the window "add applications on startup" in order to solve my problem?
2010-01-08T09:03:00.000Z	FernandoF	Losha	did you get my question or still not able to understand me?
2010-01-08T09:04:00.000Z	Losha	FernandoF	I understand your problem better now. But I don't know the answer :-(
2010-01-08T09:04:00.000Z	FernandoF	Losha	:) thx
2010-01-08T09:05:00.000Z	Losha	FernandoF	Are your disks encrypted?
2010-01-08T09:05:00.000Z	FernandoF	Losha	yes
2010-01-08T09:06:00.000Z	Losha	FernandoF	makes sense. You're obviously missing the encryption app. I don't know much about those, though....
2010-01-08T09:07:00.000Z	FernandoF	Losha	thx
2010-01-08T09:08:00.000Z	FernandoF	Losha	what i need is the data to fullfill the window about "add Application" and just give back what I silly  erased
2010-01-08T09:09:00.000Z	Losha	FernandoF	sorry, I don't know the answer. Perhaps someone else here will....
2010-01-08T09:09:00.000Z	FernandoF	Losha	data options on the window are "name"; "command" and "comment"
