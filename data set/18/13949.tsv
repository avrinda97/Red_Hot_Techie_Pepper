2005-10-01T09:00:00.000Z	drogoh		Because I have SATA and it acts like it doesn't have SATA support in the kernel.
2005-10-01T09:01:00.000Z	drogoh		Hm.
2005-10-01T09:01:00.000Z	drogoh		I peeped around in the modules and saw a few SATA controller modules but that was it.
2005-10-01T09:02:00.000Z	BlueEagle	drogoh	I've got SATA and it's working perfectly. Which controller have you got there?
2005-10-01T09:02:00.000Z	drogoh	BlueEagle	Sec.  Don't have the exact model on hand but it's Intel.
2005-10-01T09:05:00.000Z	drogoh	BlueEagle	Windows is telling me Intel 82801 GR/GH for the SATA controller.
2005-10-01T09:05:00.000Z	BlueEagle	drogoh	Hmm.. not familiar with that controller. What does google say?
2005-10-01T09:06:00.000Z	drogoh	BlueEagle	Not much, just a couple of Dell forum posts (it is a Dell).
2005-10-01T09:07:00.000Z	BlueEagle	drogoh	Ehh.. Are you sure about that chip? As far as I can tell Intel 82801 is a sensor chip on the I2C bus.
2005-10-01T09:08:00.000Z	BlueEagle	drogoh	Never mind that. It appears to be a bridge chip or something. (?)
2005-10-01T09:10:00.000Z	BlueEagle	drogoh	did either of the ICH5R or ICH6R modules work?
2005-10-01T09:11:00.000Z	drogoh	BlueEagle	Honest, SATA is a little uncharted for me and red flags flew up when the installer didn't detect anything...
2005-10-01T09:12:00.000Z	BlueEagle	drogoh	Well, it might be that they are simply not supported. :/
2005-10-01T09:13:00.000Z	drogoh	BlueEagle	How so?  Gentoo Riceburner supported it out of the box.
2005-10-01T09:16:00.000Z	BlueEagle	drogoh	Well, if you can lsmod it and get the module needed things would be easier.
2005-10-01T09:18:00.000Z	drogoh	BlueEagle	It would but I have no way of actually getting Gentoo booted on here.
2005-10-01T09:18:00.000Z	BlueEagle	drogoh	The minimal iso should suffice tbh.
