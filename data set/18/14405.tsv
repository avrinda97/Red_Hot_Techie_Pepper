2005-08-05T11:35:00.000Z	indigirl1		sudo: unable to lookup satellite via gethostbyname()
2005-08-05T11:35:00.000Z	indigirl1		i changed /etc/hosts and suddenly i'm unable to sudo anything! so i can't even fix the hosts file. help!
2005-08-05T11:36:00.000Z	gradzac	indigirl1	use "su" and become root
2005-08-05T11:36:00.000Z	indigirl1	gradzac	ubuntu doesn't allow su
2005-08-05T11:36:00.000Z	gradzac	indigirl1	sure it does, I use it all the time
2005-08-05T11:37:00.000Z	gradzac	indigirl1	it is more correct to say that you can't log in as root unless you set a root password :)
2005-08-05T11:38:00.000Z	gradzac	indigirl1	I think you can pass a kernel parameter to start in runlevel 0
2005-08-05T11:39:00.000Z	indigirl1	gradzac	how do i set a root passwd after this mess is fixed?
2005-08-05T11:39:00.000Z	gradzac	indigirl1	sudo passwd root
2005-08-05T11:40:00.000Z	gradzac	indigirl1	you said you messed with hosts.conf?  can you fix that with the network app on the System menu?
2005-08-05T11:40:00.000Z	indigirl1	gradzac	not hosts.conf but hosts
2005-08-05T11:41:00.000Z	gradzac	indigirl1	yeah, thats what I meant :)
2005-08-05T11:41:00.000Z	gradzac	indigirl1	there is a hosts tab in the network settings app
2005-08-05T11:42:00.000Z	indigirl1	gradzac	looks like network settings won't even open. probably screwed up by this
2005-08-05T11:42:00.000Z	gradzac	indigirl1	probably so, just another thought on how to fix your problem
2005-08-05T11:43:00.000Z	indigirl1	gradzac	what is the consensus on how to set root passwd?
2005-08-05T11:43:00.000Z	gradzac	indigirl1	"sudo passwd root"
2005-08-05T11:45:00.000Z	gradzac	indigirl1	good luck
