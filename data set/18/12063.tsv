2006-06-06T12:12:00.000Z	mo0se		but this is funky.
2006-06-06T12:12:00.000Z	mo0se		because it's running on vmware.
2006-06-06T12:14:00.000Z	mo0se		what's the command to see what the partitions are in the terminal?
2006-06-06T12:15:00.000Z	mo0se		is it mount?
2006-06-06T12:15:00.000Z	mo0se		O.o
2006-06-06T12:15:00.000Z	mo0se		fdisk?
2006-06-06T12:15:00.000Z	mo0se		oh.
2006-06-06T12:15:00.000Z	mo0se		which one's the one that will let me see the ones that aren't mounted?
2006-06-06T12:15:00.000Z	mo0se		wow... typo.
2006-06-06T12:15:00.000Z	mo0se		heh.
2006-06-06T12:15:00.000Z	skippy81	mo0se	 mount will show you mounted, fdisk and then "p" will show you all your partitions i belive
2006-06-06T12:16:00.000Z	skippy81	mo0se	 or you could use the gnome disk utitility or download qparted
2006-06-06T12:23:00.000Z	skippy81	mo0se	i think the thing you mean might be xgl-compiz
2006-06-06T12:26:00.000Z	skippy81	mo0se	 it will work, but you wont get the fancy compiz effects
2006-06-06T12:26:00.000Z	skippy81	mo0se	XGL provides the environment, compiz runs within XGL as a replacement window manager (instead of metacity etc)
2006-06-06T12:27:00.000Z	skippy81	mo0se	 think of it as xorg vs XGL and metacity vs compiz
2006-06-06T12:27:00.000Z	skippy81	mo0se	 phear the wobble :)
2006-06-06T12:28:00.000Z	skippy81	mo0se	 it might be worth you using XGL anyway - you should get decent window acceleration - things will look smoother
