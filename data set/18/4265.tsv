2009-06-04T01:29:00.000Z	fccf	helper	maxlogins limits the number of times a user can login ... meaning once they have logged in X number of times they cannot ever login again ever---... PAM auditing allows for what you are talking about
2009-06-04T01:30:00.000Z	helper	fccf	yes i want like this ! where i can modify the PAM then ?
2009-06-04T01:31:00.000Z	fccf	helper	patience --- I have to figure it out
2009-06-04T01:31:00.000Z	helper	fccf	in /etc/pam.d ?
2009-06-04T01:32:00.000Z	helper	fccf	i found it in /etc/pam.d and it's set to : session    required     pam_limits.so
2009-06-04T01:35:00.000Z	fccf	helper	/etc/security/limits.conf  --- see maxsyslogins

2009-06-04T01:36:00.000Z	helper	fccf	i want to limit the user i try maxlogin , i try maxsyslogins
2009-06-04T01:36:00.000Z	helper	fccf	yes ofcourse
2009-06-04T01:36:00.000Z	helper	fccf	it's not forcing to limit via ssh
