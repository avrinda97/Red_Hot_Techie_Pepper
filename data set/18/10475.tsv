2007-01-14T09:55:00.000Z	mnoir	Math^	what do you mean "all"?  there are some files that should not be world readable
2007-01-14T09:56:00.000Z	mnoir	Math^	math is your uid?  well i think you are making a mistaks but yes - -R means recursive.  please man chmod before doing it though
2007-01-14T10:08:00.000Z	mnoir	Math^	man ls and see if there is a parm for that
2007-01-14T10:09:00.000Z	Math^	mnoir	ok... so u use 'ls' to view what it does?
