2005-12-03T13:30:00.000Z	Kyral	mamoru	Beagle is very powerful for searching your personal stuffs
2005-12-03T13:30:00.000Z	Kyral	mamoru	but if you need to search the system files use slocate
2005-12-03T13:31:00.000Z	mamoru	Kyral	thx, got it. 'locate' is a symlink to 'slocate' :)
2005-12-03T13:31:00.000Z	mamoru		or smthng similar
2005-12-03T13:31:00.000Z	Kyral		lol it is?
2005-12-03T13:31:00.000Z	Kyral	mamoru	it usually updates every night
2005-12-03T13:31:00.000Z	Kyral		but to force it to update run sudo slocate -u /
2005-12-03T13:31:00.000Z	mamoru	Kyral	unfortunately at night my PC is usually down
2005-12-03T13:32:00.000Z	Kyral		Wouldn't anacron do that then..
2005-12-03T13:32:00.000Z	mamoru	Kyral	so it is slocating -u now...
