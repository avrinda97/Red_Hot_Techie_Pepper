2005-03-02T11:56:00.000Z	HiddenWolf	sander__	sorry, but still not perfect
2005-03-02T11:57:00.000Z	sander__	HiddenWolf	just checking. I have just about everything else working under Debian unstable, but that would really swing me to Hoary. I know it's more of a goal, so I was wondering how it was going. Thanks for the update.
2005-03-03T10:19:00.000Z	sander__		Anyone having trouble with the latest OpenOffice.org on Hoary?
2005-03-03T10:21:00.000Z	sander__		Just the latest 1.1. I just moved over from Debian and whenever I try to open the docs I created before writer just shows a completely blank window.
2005-03-03T10:22:00.000Z	sander__		I copied them over from my Windows box that I stored my docs on while I upgraded my laptop so they might have been mangled by samba/nautilus.
2005-03-03T10:23:00.000Z	sander__		These are all native OOo docs. They open fine on my Windows box.
2005-03-03T10:24:00.000Z	sander__		Hmmm, OK. Maybe something else happened to the docs in transit. thanks Bandit ad_bon_bon and viper12
2005-03-03T10:25:00.000Z	sander__		BTW is OOo 2.0 in the ubuntu repositories somewhere?
2005-03-03T10:25:00.000Z	sander__		Well why not. :)

2005-03-03T10:29:00.000Z	sander__	HiddenWolf	thanks.

2005-03-03T10:29:00.000Z	HiddenWolf	sander__	it's buggy tho
2005-03-03T10:30:00.000Z	sander__	HiddenWolf	thanks for the warning. I think it can co-exist with 1.1 so I don't mind the bugs for now.
