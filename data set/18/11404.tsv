2007-07-23T16:18:00.000Z	kinection		I'm trying to do an apt-get upgrade and it seems like i can't contact the servers. when I try to ping it (ping ca.archive.ubuntu.com
2007-07-23T16:18:00.000Z	kinection		) it fails as well
2007-07-23T16:18:00.000Z	kinection		says that TTL exceeded
2007-07-23T16:18:00.000Z	kinection		can anybody help me out here?
2007-07-23T16:19:00.000Z	nikin	kinection	did you try to ping archive.ubuntu.com ?
2007-07-23T16:19:00.000Z	kinection	nikin	that is fine
2007-07-23T16:20:00.000Z	kinection	nikin	I can also ping ca.archive.ubuntu.com from my computer here. (I'm in the US, the computer i'm trying to update is in canada)
2007-07-23T16:20:00.000Z	nikin	kinection	than your national server is down.. simply edit /etc/apt/sources.list to use the base servers
2007-07-23T16:21:00.000Z	nikin	kinection	maybe some routing problem... hapens sometime
2007-07-23T16:21:00.000Z	kinection	nikin	any way to get around that without futzing up the sources ?
2007-07-23T16:22:00.000Z	nikin	kinection	hmm... no other idea...
2007-07-23T16:23:00.000Z	nikin	kinection	the only thing that comes in mind that there is somewhere a fireall which is blocking the server
2007-07-23T16:24:00.000Z	kinection	nikin	yea. i told him to turn off his firewall though.. i'm trusting him on that
2007-07-23T16:24:00.000Z	nikin	kinection	maybe it is the ISP-s firewall, or some other somewhere
2007-07-23T16:24:00.000Z	kinection	nikin	he uses "Rogers"
2007-07-23T16:25:00.000Z	kinection	nikin	it's possible, i hear they throttle bittorrent as well
2007-07-23T16:25:00.000Z	nikin	kinection	i ame in the other side of the planet :D
2007-07-23T16:28:00.000Z	nikin	kinection	nor tcptracepath?
