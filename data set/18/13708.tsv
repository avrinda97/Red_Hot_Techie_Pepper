2005-12-31T06:55:00.000Z	jgrieves	twysted	im trying to mount it :)
2005-12-31T06:55:00.000Z	jgrieves	twysted	I plugged it in, loaded hte module it needed
2005-12-31T06:55:00.000Z	jgrieves	twysted	looks like it keeps trying to mount but failing, but i am not quite sure where the error would go?
2005-12-31T06:55:00.000Z	jgrieves	twysted	would hotplug deamon be taking care of that?
2005-12-31T06:56:00.000Z	jgrieves	twysted	it is on sdm now :)
2005-12-31T06:57:00.000Z	jgrieves	twysted	any ideas where to look for this one?
2005-12-31T07:01:00.000Z	jgrieves	twysted	your the only one who has commented to me :) i'm going to keep bugging you until you respond
2005-12-31T07:02:00.000Z	jgrieves	twysted	its not in fstab
2005-12-31T07:03:00.000Z	jgrieves	twysted	i just loaded a kernel module to be able to bring it up
2005-12-31T07:03:00.000Z	jgrieves	twysted	i can't its not staying on a /dev filesystem :)
2005-12-31T07:03:00.000Z	jgrieves	twysted	it keeps going from /dev/sdaX where X = a new letter/number
2005-12-31T07:03:00.000Z	jgrieves	twysted	done :)
2005-12-31T07:04:00.000Z	jgrieves	twysted	wouldn't hotplug deamon be handling that?
2005-12-31T07:04:00.000Z	jgrieves	twysted	possible, but i just want to see where its producing error messages
2005-12-31T07:07:00.000Z	jgrieves	twysted	oddly enough it seems to be picking up everything correctly
2005-12-31T07:16:00.000Z	jgrieves	twysted	i found the error, u any good with scsi/usb?
2005-12-31T07:16:00.000Z	jgrieves	twysted	it picks everything up fine :)
