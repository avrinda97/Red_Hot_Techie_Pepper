2010-07-08T01:25:00.000Z	Silent_Dream		Hi, I was upgrading Ubuntu 9.10 to 10.04 and my system froze at about 85% of the upgrade process, so I had no other option to reboot, and when I did, my windows partition is gone and I cant access it, and Ubuntu 10.04 wont load
2010-07-08T01:25:00.000Z	Silent_Dream		any advice
2010-07-08T01:25:00.000Z	ChogyDan	Silent_Dream	is grub working?
2010-07-08T01:26:00.000Z	Silent_Dream	ChogyDan	Yes, grub loads, but my windows partition isnt shown, and the linux partition loads up 10.04 which never will get past the load screen
2010-07-08T01:26:00.000Z	ChogyDan	Silent_Dream	you mean windows isn't listed in the grub menu?
2010-07-08T01:26:00.000Z	Silent_Dream	ChogyDan	correct
2010-07-08T01:27:00.000Z	ChogyDan	Silent_Dream	I would try some recovery stuff with a livecd, starting with recovering grub
2010-07-08T01:27:00.000Z	Silent_Dream	ChogyDan	What recovery stuff, what livecd, how do i recover grub
2010-07-08T01:28:00.000Z	ChogyDan	Silent_Dream	basically, are there any selections you can make in the grub menu to boot?
2010-07-08T01:28:00.000Z	Silent_Dream	ChogyDan	Yes, they are all linux partitions I think, I can check if you want (the comp in question is upstairs)
2010-07-08T01:30:00.000Z	ChogyDan	Silent_Dream	ya, you should check, otherwise you will have to go the livecd route
2010-07-08T01:33:00.000Z	Silent_Dream	ChogyDan	wildbat: I can boot into recovery mode
2010-07-08T01:34:00.000Z	ChogyDan	Silent_Dream	start with sudo apt-get upgrade
2010-07-08T01:40:00.000Z	Silent_Dream	ChogyDan	wildbat: I dont know whats going on, because I boot into recovery mode, and I see this menu, and when I press the down arrow key to go through the menu options, it just starts loading ubuntu 10.04 instead, which is stuck on load
2010-07-08T01:42:00.000Z	ChogyDan	Silent_Dream	I don't know, and wildcat left  :(
2010-07-08T01:42:00.000Z	Silent_Dream	ChogyDan	Oh dear
2010-07-08T01:42:00.000Z	ChogyDan	Silent_Dream	I would try anything you can to get any sort of boot
