2009-10-24T17:24:00.000Z	Sasuke\	Sagaci	live cd? what you mnean?
2009-10-24T17:24:00.000Z	Sagaci	Sasuke\	what version of ubuntu do you want to install
2009-10-24T17:25:00.000Z	Sasuke\	Sagaci	the latest one
2009-10-24T17:25:00.000Z	Sagaci	Sasuke\	9.04 that is. Are you looking to install the desktop, server or netbook edition
2009-10-24T17:25:00.000Z	Sasuke\	Sagaci	for my personal computer
2009-10-24T17:26:00.000Z	Sagaci	Sasuke\	well you need the desktop edition then, have you got an ubuntu cd there
2009-10-24T17:27:00.000Z	Sasuke\	Sagaci	i have it in my friend. im gonna get it later.
2009-10-24T17:27:00.000Z	Sasuke\	Sagaci	how do i know that my friend downloaded the dekstop edition?
2009-10-24T17:29:00.000Z	Sagaci	Sasuke\	try and boot from it, if you get an outdated no Graphical User Interface, then you've got the server or alternate CD. I recommend you get the Ubuntu Jaunty Desktop edition
2009-10-24T17:29:00.000Z	Sagaci	Sasuke\	depends on the model
2009-10-24T17:31:00.000Z	Sagaci	Sasuke\	you have to realise that many manufacturers do not release source code or drivers for their hardware so it makes it hard for Ubuntu to support it
2009-10-24T17:34:00.000Z	Sasuke\	Sagaci	is it ok if i install a ubuntu alternate?
2009-10-24T17:34:00.000Z	Sagaci	Sasuke\	yes but the installation process is more advanced than the GUI version
2009-10-24T17:36:00.000Z	Sagaci	Sasuke\	if you've got a spare few dollars, you could buy a linux magazine from your local newsagent, look for a mag that has Ubuntu 9.04 on the front
2009-10-24T17:37:00.000Z	Sagaci	Sasuke\	and if you have the time, you could wait a week until the new ubuntu 9.10 is released
