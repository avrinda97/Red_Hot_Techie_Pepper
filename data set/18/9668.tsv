2007-03-24T13:01:00.000Z	mhemu		can anyone give me a hand with gnome network manager???
2007-03-24T13:03:00.000Z	mhemu		i installed gnome network manager to get my wireless going and it somehow got removed from my taskbar, basically rendering it useless. Any ideas how to get it back up? removing it and installing it again didn't do the trick
2007-03-24T13:03:00.000Z	MatthewV	mhemu	the command to get it back in the taskbar is nmapplet
2007-03-24T13:04:00.000Z	mhemu	MatthewV	that will work in the add custom applet to the taskbar?
2007-03-24T13:04:00.000Z	MatthewV	mhemu	if you hit Alt-F2, then type in 'nmapplet' and hit enter that should do it
2007-03-24T13:05:00.000Z	mhemu	MatthewV	no dice, says it's not found
2007-03-24T13:06:00.000Z	mhemu	MatthewV	is nmapplet found in some place special?
2007-03-24T13:08:00.000Z	MatthewV	mhemu	try installing network-manager-gnome
2007-03-24T13:08:00.000Z	mhemu	MatthewV	it is already installed
2007-03-24T13:10:00.000Z	mhemu	MatthewV	it is installed and running correctly, the app just doesn't show up in the taskbar, which makes me unable to connect to the various wireless AP's that I need to
2007-03-24T13:10:00.000Z	MatthewV	mhemu	yep i get you... just taking a look now
2007-03-24T13:10:00.000Z	MatthewV	mhemu	try 'nm-applet' sorry
2007-03-24T13:11:00.000Z	mhemu	MatthewV	if it helps, the battery monitor is gone now too, along with the standard seperator between the right side items like the shutdown button and time
2007-03-24T13:11:00.000Z	MatthewV	mhemu	ah....
2007-03-24T13:12:00.000Z	mhemu	MatthewV	that did it, thanks!! did i inadvertantly do something that I can avoid in the future??
2007-03-24T13:13:00.000Z	MatthewV	mhemu	you probably removed the notification area applet, which is what displays the icons from nm-applet, gaim etc
2007-03-24T13:14:00.000Z	mhemu	MatthewV	gotcha. thanks so much, about to get on a plane and thought i screwed myself! have a good night!
2007-03-24T13:14:00.000Z	MatthewV	mhemu	not a problem :)
