2012-06-17T17:55:00.000Z	Kikody		Has anyone an idea why my ubuntu 11.10 installation on an 8GB USB Stick doesn´t boot correctly and instead shows something called like "bitbox" whre i could work with ash and in the line on the left stands <initframfs>? I already reinstalled grub, but it didn´t solve the problem...
2012-06-17T17:57:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	Kikody	how did you reinstall grub?
2012-06-17T18:01:00.000Z	Kikody	wilee-nilee	i started a live system of Ubuntu 11.10, mounted the partition with the ubuntu installation with 'sudo mount /dev/sdc1 /mnt' and then installed grub with 'sudo grub-install --boot-directory=/mnt/boot /dev/sdc'
2012-06-17T18:03:00.000Z	Kikody	wilee-nilee	i´ll try

2012-06-17T18:39:00.000Z	Kikody	wilee-nilee	ok thank you so far :-)
2012-06-17T18:42:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	Kikody	if you try this ignore the [/code] after the update grub command I did not notice that when I posted.
2012-06-17T18:50:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	Kikody	has it ever booted on this computer to the ubuntu install, it seemed it had been running.
2012-06-17T18:51:00.000Z	Kikody	wilee-nilee	i tried to start ubuntu several times before and looked what happens when i type in 'help' but i never saw the desktop
2012-06-17T18:53:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	Kikody	ah so it could just be a bad install, or some other block, you were getting errors.
2012-06-17T18:55:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	Kikody	your in good hands here I will do some other work.
2012-06-17T18:56:00.000Z	Kikody	wilee-nilee	ok
