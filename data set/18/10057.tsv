2008-10-01T21:48:00.000Z	Wipster		hey all, is it possible to seperate a network into two parts which cannot see each other but can see the internet, all coming in on one interface (eth0)
2008-10-01T21:49:00.000Z	Wipster		I have been trying to use aliasing and a dhcp to put people in the correct subnet but sofar I have been un successfull as my computer has been able to ping both 192.168.2.1 and 1.1
2008-10-01T21:50:00.000Z	unop	Wipster	and which subnet is your computer part of?
2008-10-01T21:51:00.000Z	unop	Wipster	was part of? how about now?
2008-10-01T21:51:00.000Z	Wipster	unop	it still is I have reverted my changed that I was making and searching for help in the matter
2008-10-01T21:51:00.000Z	unop	Wipster	what separates 1.x from 2.x ? and is the subnet mask 255.255.255.0 for both?
2008-10-01T21:53:00.000Z	Wipster	unop	the subnet is 255.255.255.0 for both yes - I was hoping both subnets couldn't see each other
2008-10-01T21:54:00.000Z	unop	Wipster	well, what separates (or joins) the two subnets ??  a router
2008-10-01T21:57:00.000Z	Wipster	unop	yeh a router joins the two networks (sorry I didn't understand the first time)
2008-10-01T21:58:00.000Z	unop	Wipster	ok, it's probable that the router allows cross-subnet communication - i can't think of anything else that would allow you to pind 2.x from 1.1
2008-10-01T21:58:00.000Z	unop	Wipster	perhaps you should be looking to configure the router to stop people from pinging across subnets
2008-10-01T21:58:00.000Z	unop	Wipster	s/pind/ping/
2008-10-01T21:59:00.000Z	Wipster	unop	ok well its loaded with linux I tried adding a iptables rule to stop 192.168.1.0/24 communicating with 192.168.2.0/24 and vice versa but it didn't seem to work
2008-10-01T22:00:00.000Z	Wipster	unop	I am a bit inexperianced with networking and linux but I am sure I can make it work somehow
2008-10-01T22:01:00.000Z	unop	Wipster	sure - just takes a little patience and some research .. but this should stop ip forwarding. on the router itself.  echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
2008-10-01T22:06:00.000Z	Wipster	unop	that command stopped me from pinging from my computer out to the wan untill I reverted it
2008-10-01T22:13:00.000Z	Wipster	unop	so what would you recomend as reading material for serperating networks on the same interface? my google powers havn't turned up much...
2008-10-01T22:15:00.000Z	unop	Wipster	sub-interfaces perhaps, multiple IP addresses
