2008-02-07T19:20:00.000Z	toplok		isn't vmware-player no longer supported in Ubuntu 7.10 ?
2008-02-07T19:21:00.000Z	toplok		I can't install it from add-remove
2008-02-07T19:22:00.000Z	toplok		could someone confirm if vmware-player works or not in ubuntu 7.10 ?
2008-02-07T19:22:00.000Z	bazhang	toplok	vmware-server is, not sure about player--it is in the repos
2008-02-07T19:22:00.000Z	bazhang	toplok	use it all the time--very easy to setup btw
2008-02-07T19:22:00.000Z	toplok	bazhang	yes, it is there, but it can't be installed.
2008-02-07T19:22:00.000Z	toplok	bazhang	in 7.10
2008-02-07T19:23:00.000Z	bazhang	toplok	how did you try to install it and what error message did you get
2008-02-07T19:23:00.000Z	toplok	bazhang	VMware Player cannot be installed on your computer type (i386).
2008-02-07T19:23:00.000Z	toplok	bazhang	I am using core quad Q6600
2008-02-07T19:24:00.000Z	bazhang	toplok	aha what about vmware-server?
2008-02-07T19:24:00.000Z	toplok	bazhang	is it free ?
2008-02-07T19:24:00.000Z	bazhang	toplok	as in no charge yes
2008-02-07T19:25:00.000Z	toplok	bazhang	is it available from add-remove ?
2008-02-07T19:25:00.000Z	bazhang	toplok	no idea never use it--enable gutsy canonical partner in synaptic update sources list then search for it and try to install it
2008-02-07T19:26:00.000Z	toplok	bazhang	should I use sudo apt-get install vmware-server ?
2008-02-07T19:27:00.000Z	bazhang	toplok	after you have added the repo in synaptic yes--though you will have to get the free key from www.vmware.com
2008-02-07T19:28:00.000Z	bazhang	toplok	enable the repo; download it; get the free key from vmware site; enter the key; finish installation--voila!
