2008-12-24T14:14:00.000Z	jim_p	cwillu	what cand are you on?
2009-01-25T14:50:00.000Z	jim_p	cwillu	while pulseaudio is not broken?
2009-01-25T14:50:00.000Z	cwillu	jim_p	had no issues whatsoever across 4 laptops and a couple dozen different desktops
2009-01-25T14:51:00.000Z	jim_p	cwillu	pulseaudio early adoption is the main cause of ubuntu sound problems, even when they underlying sound cards are supported 1000% by alsa, so its removal is a wise movement
2009-01-25T14:51:00.000Z	cwillu	jim_p	pulseaudio still uses alsa
2009-01-25T14:52:00.000Z	jim_p	cwillu	are you serious? pulseaudio and alsa are 2 DIFFERENT sound layers.
2009-01-25T14:52:00.000Z	cwillu	jim_p	alsa is the driver architecture, and it's also an api that people use.  Pulseaudio uses alsa to talk to the hardware, and it supports an alsa layer for apps that try to talk directly to the alsa api's
2009-01-25T14:53:00.000Z	jim_p	cwillu	i dare you to ask in pulseaudio or alsa channel for that
2009-01-25T14:54:00.000Z	jim_p	cwillu	here read the proof that pa is not alsa at all         http://packages.ubuntu.com/intrepid/pulseaudio
2009-01-25T14:54:00.000Z	cwillu	jim_p	"in a typical installation scenario under linux, the user configures alsa to use a virtual device provided by Pulseaudio.  Thus, applications using ALSA will output sound to PulsAudio, which then uses ALSA itself to access the real sound card"
2009-01-25T14:55:00.000Z	jim_p	cwillu	give me a sec with this nonsense
2009-01-25T14:55:00.000Z	cwillu	jim_p	lol
2009-01-25T15:03:00.000Z	jim_p	cwillu	so it uses alsa as a second helping hand, as it does with the rest soundsystems! while alsa is THE audio management app under linux, pulseaudio uses it as a helper. let me laugh
2009-01-25T15:04:00.000Z	cwillu	jim_p	you have an interesting conception of what alsa actually is providing
2009-01-25T15:05:00.000Z	jim_p	cwillu	what does it provide?
2009-01-25T15:05:00.000Z	jim_p	cwillu	ok do what you think correct. i retire
2009-01-25T15:29:00.000Z	jim_p	cwillu	did the rocksteady pulseaudio work yet?
2009-01-25T15:29:00.000Z	cwillu	jim_p	for everything except for the closed app that has a buggy alsa implementation that would also break on any card that didn't need dmis
