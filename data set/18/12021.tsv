2007-11-25T07:57:00.000Z	ADemiG0d		i cant reinstall grub
2007-11-25T07:57:00.000Z	ADemiG0d		i get error 21 every time
2007-11-25T07:57:00.000Z	Pelo	ADemiG0d	what partiton is ubuntu on ? the devtree ?
2007-11-25T07:59:00.000Z	Pelo	ADemiG0d	that would be  hd0,0,  when you get to the grub menu,  select the ubuntu entry in the list and hit e for edit,  then select the root line and hit e for edit,  change the hd... for hd0,0, then hit enter and b for boot
2007-11-25T07:59:00.000Z	Pelo	ADemiG0d	 adter that if you boot correctly go and edit /boot/grub/menu.lst to make the change permanent
2007-11-25T08:00:00.000Z	Pelo	ADemiG0d	is ubunutu installed on an external hdd ?
2007-11-25T08:00:00.000Z	Pelo	ADemiG0d	here is why ,  grub is in two parts
2007-11-25T08:01:00.000Z	Pelo	ADemiG0d	stage one on the boot hdd, stage 2 on the hdd with ubuntu on it,  stage one refers to the menu.lst on stage to to get you the boot menu
2007-11-25T08:02:00.000Z	Pelo	ADemiG0d	you need to dl the supergrub cd to change the mbr on your internal boot hdd back to the original windows mbr,  and then you can install a statge 1 on the external hdd, and boot from it when you nee dto start ubuntu
2007-11-25T08:03:00.000Z	Pelo	ADemiG0d	ubotu will give you a bunch of links,  last link, toward the bottom of the page
2007-11-25T08:08:00.000Z	Pelo	ADemiG0d	that's not how it works,  there is no stage 1 file, persay
2007-11-25T08:12:00.000Z	Pelo	ADemiG0d	get the supergrub cd , last link toward thebottom ofthe page, tehre is a link for it, you dl it you burn it ,and you boot from it,  it has menues in it with options for you to chose to restore the windows mbr and install stage 1 on the esternal hdd
2007-11-25T08:13:00.000Z	Pelo	ADemiG0d	you are not listening , and apparently neitherwas I
2007-11-25T08:14:00.000Z	Pelo	ADemiG0d	that was a mistake on my part,  give me a minute to get you a link
2007-11-25T08:16:00.000Z	Pelo	ADemiG0d	 you have ubuntu installed on your internal hdd right ? and on an external hdd is that correct ?
2007-11-25T08:16:00.000Z	Pelo	ADemiG0d	ok here is a link to the supergrug cd,  dl it and burn it,   http://supergrub.forjamari.linex.org/
2007-11-25T08:17:00.000Z	Pelo	ADemiG0d	 when you boot from it , you go into the gnu/linux section,  tell it to restore the stage 1 on the internal and make it point to the /boot/grub/menu.lst on the internal hdd
2007-11-25T08:18:00.000Z	Pelo	ADemiG0d	 you'll have to figure out the menus on your own I haven't done this in a while and I can't walk you through it
