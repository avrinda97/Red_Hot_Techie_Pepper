2009-09-17T00:54:00.000Z	saji	paschu	the only way to play shockwave is install the shocwave via Wine..
2009-09-17T00:54:00.000Z	paschu	saji	and then it will work?
2009-09-17T00:55:00.000Z	saji	paschu	i haven't checked that, but when i searched for this some time ago... This was the only solution...
2009-09-17T00:55:00.000Z	saji	paschu	for that only flash is needed...
2009-09-17T00:59:00.000Z	saji	paschu	the package name is flashplugin-installer..
2009-09-17T01:00:00.000Z	saji	paschu	is that the package that you installed?
2009-09-17T01:00:00.000Z	saji	paschu	the same player works fine for me.... :)
