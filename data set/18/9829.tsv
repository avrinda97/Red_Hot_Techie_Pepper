2007-02-19T11:47:00.000Z	Jackz		When I install the most recent drivers from Synaptic, and reboot, I get xserver errors, and the most recent drivers from nvidia are different, more up to date.. should I use them instead?  Also, if I recover the original config with the command it gives me after installing the drivers, will it fix my problem?

2007-02-19T11:49:00.000Z	macd	Jackz	yes, no, yes.
2007-02-19T12:26:00.000Z	macd	Jackz	b/c you did not sudo first.
2007-02-19T12:27:00.000Z	macd	Jackz	thats rather impossible, unless the file is in use by another process.
2007-02-19T12:40:00.000Z	macd	Jackz	is this an ATI card?
2007-02-19T12:40:00.000Z	macd	Jackz	did you install the nvidia drivers?
2007-02-19T12:40:00.000Z	macd	Jackz	"glxinfo | grep direct" shows yes or no?
2007-02-19T12:44:00.000Z	macd	Jackz	wait that command "glxinfo | grep direct" shows you all zeros?
2007-02-19T12:46:00.000Z	macd	Jackz	ok, then you need to edit your /etc/X11/xorg.conf and add:  Load           "glx"
2007-02-19T12:46:00.000Z	macd	Jackz	where all the other load lines are will be fine
2007-02-19T12:49:00.000Z	Jackz	macd	Sorry for being.. such a n00b, but how am I supposed to add the line? In gedit I can't save it because it's read-only..
2007-02-19T12:49:00.000Z	macd	Jackz	yeah you need to sudo ;)
2007-02-19T12:51:00.000Z	Jackz	macd	How'm I supposed to sudo from gedit?.. in gedit?.. ect
2007-02-19T12:51:00.000Z	macd	Jackz	ohh I was saying from a terminal "sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf"
2007-02-19T12:52:00.000Z	macd	Jackz	its a editor
2007-02-19T12:54:00.000Z	Jackz	macd	Thanks again, sorry I'm such a n00b.. now I have to restart for that to take effect.. so I'll be back shortly..
2007-02-19T12:54:00.000Z	macd	Jackz	just log out of X.
