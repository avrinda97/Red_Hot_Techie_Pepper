2006-03-23T09:39:00.000Z	bobby		I have looked in forums, but they explain about keyboard mappings
2006-03-23T09:39:00.000Z	bobby		the only way that I am sure the problem is going to be fixed is if I reinstall Ubuntu
2006-03-23T09:39:00.000Z	bobby		but I am sure there must be an easier way
2006-03-23T09:40:00.000Z	apokryphos	bobby	I'd presume that it would be fine if you just plugged in the ps/2 mouse in now, and disconnected the usb one.
2006-03-23T09:40:00.000Z	apokryphos	bobby	does the actual keyboard definitely work?
2006-03-23T09:42:00.000Z	apokryphos	bobby	ok, then just reconfigure your X and specify that you're using a ps/2 keyboard, then restart x
2006-03-23T09:43:00.000Z	apokryphos	bobby	I'm not sure if it asks on the dpkg-reconfigure. But you can definitely just edit it manually.
2006-03-23T09:43:00.000Z	apokryphos	bobby	make your keyboard section look a bit like this: http://pastebin.com/609127
2006-03-23T09:44:00.000Z	apokryphos	bobby	obviously you might want a different XkbLayout/Variant. Mine there is set to GB keyboard.
2006-03-23T09:45:00.000Z	apokryphos	bobby	heh, silly me. I forget to tell you the file was /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2006-03-23T09:45:00.000Z	apokryphos	bobby	just alt+f2 -> gksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2006-03-23T09:46:00.000Z	apokryphos	bobby	so much what?
2006-03-23T09:46:00.000Z	apokryphos	bobby	after you've edited it, make sure you save it and then ctrl+alt+backspace and plug in the new keyboard.
2006-03-23T09:48:00.000Z	apokryphos	bobby	not sure if it would, yes.
2006-03-23T09:48:00.000Z	apokryphos	bobby	I thought you said that computer definitely worked with that keyboard?
2006-03-23T09:49:00.000Z	apokryphos	bobby	try pressing ctrl+alt+1 and then plugging in the new keyboard. It should work, I'd think.
