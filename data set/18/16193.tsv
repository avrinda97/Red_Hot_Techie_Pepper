2004-11-03T07:13:00.000Z	Seveas		ubuntu is the first linux distro that actually would install on that machine (it's a laptop)
2004-11-03T07:14:00.000Z	Seveas		but explain this then Gmail: why does openoggice *always* hang at its splash screen?
2004-11-03T07:16:00.000Z	Seveas		so no real hostname for the machine
2004-11-03T07:16:00.000Z	Seveas		just 'raptor' which i what i entered when installing
