2009-09-02T17:47:00.000Z	TecR0c		i need some help installing ubuntu. i want to leave my windows partitions and use the empty partition on my harddrive. so im in the manual partition editor in the ubuntu installation. do i create a partition in the empty space and mount point it to / ??
2009-09-02T17:48:00.000Z	grawity	TecR0c	Yes.
2009-09-02T17:48:00.000Z	TecR0c		so i dont have make one for home and one for boot ?
2009-09-02T17:48:00.000Z	TecR0c		grawity,
2009-09-02T17:48:00.000Z	grawity	TecR0c	No, a single / is enough.
2009-09-02T17:48:00.000Z	grawity	TecR0c	It's just sometimes more convienent to have a separate /boot (full-disk encryption) and/or separate /home (easy backups)
2009-09-02T17:49:00.000Z	grawity	TecR0c	But a single / partition is enough.
2009-09-02T17:49:00.000Z	TecR0c	grawity	does it still create boot and home ?
2009-09-02T17:49:00.000Z	grawity	TecR0c	Oh, and don't forget a swap partition.
2009-09-02T17:49:00.000Z	TecR0c		oh ok
2009-09-02T17:49:00.000Z	grawity	TecR0c	If /home is not a partition, it will be created as a plain simple directory.
2009-09-02T17:49:00.000Z	TecR0c		how big should be swap be ?
2009-09-02T17:49:00.000Z	TecR0c		i have 4gig of ram
2009-09-02T17:49:00.000Z	grawity	TecR0c	I think 2x of your RAM is recommended...
2009-09-02T17:50:00.000Z	grawity	TecR0c	Or, use 4.2 GB.
2009-09-02T17:50:00.000Z	grawity		brb, food
2009-09-02T17:50:00.000Z	TecR0c	grawity	both partitions primary ?
2009-09-02T17:51:00.000Z	TecR0c	grawity	now when i go to create / it says unusable ?
