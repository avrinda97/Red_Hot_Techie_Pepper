2006-06-22T11:19:00.000Z	trappist	andii	huh?
2006-06-22T11:20:00.000Z	trappist	andii	df or df -h will tell you that
2006-06-22T11:21:00.000Z	trappist	andii	but I don't know what you mean about creating a directory
2006-06-22T11:21:00.000Z	andii	trappist	did a df -h > lala.html but also need it to create a folder with disk left and used
2006-06-22T11:22:00.000Z	trappist	andii	I'm sorry I still don't know what you need
2006-06-22T11:24:00.000Z	andii	trappist	need to create a folder that shows how mutch space that are used and how mutch that are left like: "[20gigleft/10gigused] " or something like that
2006-06-22T11:25:00.000Z	trappist	andii	folders don't do anything except contain files and other directories
2006-06-22T11:26:00.000Z	andii	trappist	i know, thats why i need a script that creates a folder(s) that shows df -h
2006-06-22T11:26:00.000Z	trappist	andii	folders don't show anything.  they just contain files.
2006-06-22T11:27:00.000Z	andii	trappist	if a script makes me a folder with name: [20gigused/20gigleft] , and are empty, then i know how mutch space i have left and so on
2006-06-22T11:28:00.000Z	trappist	andii	so you want the *name* of the folder to have that stuff.
2006-06-22T11:28:00.000Z	andii	trappist	i want a folder that shows how space used and left
2006-06-22T11:32:00.000Z	trappist	andii	mkdir "$(df -h | egrep '/$' | awk '{print $3 " used,",$4 " left"}')"
2006-06-22T11:34:00.000Z	andii	trappist	is it possible to remove that folder and create a another one every 5 minutes?
2006-06-22T11:34:00.000Z	trappist	andii	yes
2006-06-22T11:34:00.000Z	andii	trappist	can you help me with that?
