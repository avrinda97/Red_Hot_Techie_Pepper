2005-09-12T16:31:00.000Z	robtaylor		hey, i've just done a dist-upgrade to breezy today and i'm getting a lot of bus errors. anyone else seen this?
2005-09-12T16:33:00.000Z	Blissex	robtaylor	that was a very bad idea.
2005-09-12T16:33:00.000Z	robtaylor	Blissex	mm. i gathered. whats the issue, is there a fix?
2005-09-12T16:34:00.000Z	Blissex	robtaylor	probably some wrong library dependency. If you know 'aptitude' well you can probably fix it fairly easily.
2005-09-12T16:34:00.000Z	Blissex	robtaylor	try 'apt-get check' and/or look if there are some bad things with 'synaptic'
2005-09-12T16:35:00.000Z	robtaylor	Blissex	mm. my package selection looks sane
2005-09-12T16:36:00.000Z	Blissex	robtaylor	then some of those libraries or apps are broken...
2005-09-12T16:36:00.000Z	Blissex	robtaylor	which exact problems do you get?
2005-09-12T16:37:00.000Z	robtaylor	Blissex	mm. well for a start the postinst for libgtk2.0-bin is failing as i get a bus error in /usr/bin/gdk-pixbuf-query-loaders
2005-09-12T16:37:00.000Z	robtaylor	Blissex	afaict all gtk apps are bus-erroring :S
2005-09-12T16:38:00.000Z	Blissex	robtaylor	almost surely a bug in the package. You can hardly do anything for it, except to wait for a fixed package.
2005-09-12T16:38:00.000Z	Blissex	robtaylor	I would suggest looking at the bug/issue database as almost surely this has been reported.
2005-09-12T16:39:00.000Z	robtaylor	Blissex	zarro boogs
2005-09-12T16:40:00.000Z	Blissex	robtaylor	unlikely -- or else it is just you that's jinxed.
2005-09-12T16:40:00.000Z	robtaylor	Blissex	mm. i know. could be a transitional error just today
2005-09-12T16:41:00.000Z	Blissex	robtaylor	sort of unlikely, but yes, it is possible.
2005-09-12T16:42:00.000Z	Blissex	robtaylor	what you could do, if you knew how all these things work, is to hack the libgtk posting script, this would allow libgtk to install, and this may fix the rest
2005-09-12T16:44:00.000Z	robtaylor	Blissex	btw i am the debian libgnomeprint maint. broken packages i can cope with, random bus errors are a bit on teh weird side tho..
