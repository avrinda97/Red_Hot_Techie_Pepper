2008-12-29T01:13:00.000Z	yowshi1		anyone know a good defragmantation utility? i am looking as a partition with over 26% file fragmentation and it is starting to effect performance
2008-12-29T01:14:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	yowshi1	What partition format are you dealing with
2008-12-29T01:15:00.000Z	yowshi1	Jack_Sparrow	ext3
2008-12-29T01:15:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	yowshi1	I found info when I googled it..
2008-12-29T01:16:00.000Z	yowshi1	Jack_Sparrow	that was step 2. step 1 is always ask the gurus here maybe something works better with ubuntu or ubuntu has some utility in it that i dont know of yet
2008-12-29T01:16:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	yowshi1	It can be defragged, but it is generally a non - issue
2008-12-29T01:17:00.000Z	yowshi1	Jack_Sparrow	well then i must not be in the general population :)
2008-12-29T01:18:00.000Z	yowshi1	Jack_Sparrow	though it has been that this system has been running for a couple years now upgrades downlaods deletes more downloads and such windows wouldnt have lasted a quarter of the time between defrags
2008-12-29T01:24:00.000Z	yowshi1	Jack_Sparrow	grrr i cant find a linux version of a defrag utility via google. eveyething i find is for windows
2008-12-29T01:25:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	yowshi1	Let me look for a sec, I may have it bookmarked
2008-12-29T01:25:00.000Z	yowshi1	Jack_Sparrow	they say ext3 defrags itself on the fly or something but not according to my drive readouts
2008-12-29T01:33:00.000Z	yowshi1	Jack_Sparrow	how do i make fsck -a run on /dev/sdb4 on the next reboot?
2008-12-29T01:40:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	yowshi1	I would rather see you boot a ivecd and work from there
2008-12-29T01:42:00.000Z	yowshi1	Jack_Sparrow	well i am remaking m,y live usb
2008-12-29T01:42:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	yowshi1	Other than supplying reconstructor, we dont offer help with that
2008-12-29T01:44:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	yowshi1	that isnt likely to be what is causing your system to slow down
2008-12-29T01:44:00.000Z	yowshi1	Jack_Sparrow	the only thing i hav seen slow down a system in the manner mine is slowing down is a fragmented hard drive. plus it only slows when accessing the hard drive
2008-12-29T01:45:00.000Z	yowshi1	Jack_Sparrow	like when booting up a game or a programme
