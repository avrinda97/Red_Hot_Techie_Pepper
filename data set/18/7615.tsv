2007-12-18T17:14:00.000Z	Filled-void	Stevethepirate	What are you tryign to play and do you have restricted-extras installed?
2007-12-18T17:14:00.000Z	Stevethepirate	Filled-void	okay
2007-12-18T17:16:00.000Z	Filled-void	Stevethepirate	Did the above thread help or have you already tried that?
2007-12-18T17:18:00.000Z	Stevethepirate	Filled-void	which link?
2007-12-18T17:18:00.000Z	Filled-void	Stevethepirate	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats/BluRayAndHDDVD this is the thread I was talking about
2007-12-18T17:19:00.000Z	Stevethepirate	Filled-void	no.
2007-12-18T17:20:00.000Z	Filled-void	Stevethepirate	I dont see why it wouldnt :/ I dont have much experience with HD content though provided you have the right codecs to view AVIs ?
2007-12-18T17:21:00.000Z	Stevethepirate	Filled-void	well.
2007-12-18T17:25:00.000Z	Filled-void	Stevethepirate	I wish I could confirm whether ti would work or not but I think you would have better luck on Medibuntu forums as it deals much more with Media content
