2012-06-28T04:10:00.000Z	ubuntu-trial		Hey all - I just installed 12.04 x64 - I know its in /dev/sda2 - I cannot boot into the new OS now. I get the Fix Error "operating System Not Found" from Intel Boot Agent..
2012-06-28T04:11:00.000Z	ubuntu-trial		Anyone know why?
2012-06-28T04:11:00.000Z	ubuntu-trial		How do I make grub point to boot from /dev/sda2?
2012-06-28T04:11:00.000Z	spjt	ubuntu-trial	is the partition bootable?
2012-06-28T04:12:00.000Z	ubuntu-trial	spjt	Ther eis only one partition - this is a 500GB hdd. Installed 12.04 from the live CD
2012-06-28T04:12:00.000Z	spjt	ubuntu-trial	The only thing I could think of is to check to make sure the partition is marked bootable.
2012-06-28T04:13:00.000Z	ubuntu-trial	spjt	How do you do that ?
2012-06-28T04:13:00.000Z	spjt	ubuntu-trial	I'm not really sure. :)
2012-06-28T04:14:00.000Z	spjt	ubuntu-trial	OK, it has fdisk which is what I've used before. you run 'fdisk /dev/sda' and then 'l'
2012-06-28T04:20:00.000Z	ubuntu-trial	spjt	L3top, there is no * under BOOT column from fdisk o/p, denoting that the partition is not bootable?
2012-06-28T04:21:00.000Z	spjt	ubuntu-trial	Yes, if you type 'a' and then the partition number, you can type 'p' again and it should show it's bootable.
2012-06-28T04:21:00.000Z	spjt	ubuntu-trial	You need to type 'w' to save though, or else nothing will happen
2012-06-28T04:21:00.000Z	ubuntu-trial	spjt	ok we will try and report back
2012-06-28T04:23:00.000Z	ubuntu-trial	spjt	http://pastebin.com/s4yZuFDB
2012-06-28T04:24:00.000Z	ubuntu-trial	spjt	I've sent the o/p of the WRITE - which spat out an error. Hoep that is fine?
2012-06-28T04:25:00.000Z	spjt	ubuntu-trial	It might be, but if it wasn't marked bootable that's definitely a problem.
2012-06-28T04:25:00.000Z	ubuntu-trial	spjt	okay. Now it's marked as bootable
2012-06-28T04:25:00.000Z	ubuntu-trial	spjt	 let me do a reboot
