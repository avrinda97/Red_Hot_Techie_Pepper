2011-04-26T22:09:00.000Z	bafilius		is there a way to reset nautilus? at some point it got stuck trying to open an archive and now whenever I try to start nautilus it tells me it can't open the archive. rebooting has not helped.
2011-04-26T22:11:00.000Z	KM0201	bafilius	try this... opena  terminal then nautilus /home/(username)
2011-04-26T22:12:00.000Z	bafilius	KM0201	That worked, but still not working from menu
2011-04-26T22:12:00.000Z	KM0201	bafilius	someone else had that problem yesterday.
2011-04-26T22:13:00.000Z	KM0201	bafilius	hang on a sec, lemme find what his solution was.
2011-04-26T22:15:00.000Z	KM0201	bafilius	this is a log of a chat i had w/ someone who had the same problem yesterday, and he messaged me back today to tell me he fixed it, and how he done it.. http://paste.ubuntu.com/599401/
2011-04-26T22:16:00.000Z	bafilius	KM0201	tx, I"ll get back atcha
2011-04-26T22:20:00.000Z	bafilius	KM0201	not sure what changing that folder name is supposed to do
2011-04-26T22:20:00.000Z	KM0201	bafilius	if i had to guess.. i'm guessing when he rebooted, it loaded a new configuration.
2011-04-26T22:25:00.000Z	bafilius	KM0201	I'm just afraid to try that cuz he said he had to fix it with a boot disk. I really don't want to have to deal with that.
2011-04-26T22:25:00.000Z	KM0201	bafilius	read what he said, he said he moved those 4 files, and had to move them back w/ a boot disk.
2011-04-26T22:26:00.000Z	KM0201	bafilius	but his problem as exactly as you describe.
2011-04-26T22:28:00.000Z	bafilius	KM0201	I really want to avoid using a bootdisk and digging myself into a pit of complexity that I as a novice can't get back out of
2011-04-26T22:29:00.000Z	KM0201	bafilius	the only thing you'd have to do... is boot the live CD, go to the directory on your hard drive, and delete the ".old" off the end... then reboot to your install
2011-04-26T22:30:00.000Z	KM0201	bafilius	i would not attempt to upgrade a machine that you know doesn't work, or is exhibiting errors.. thats a recipe for fail.
2011-04-26T22:33:00.000Z	bafilius	KM0201	yeah, maybe I"ll try reinstalling nautilus instead and see if that helps, I just don't like to fiddle with my system files unless I absolutely have to
2011-04-26T22:33:00.000Z	KM0201	bafilius	not sure i'd try to uninstall nautilous... maybe purge/reinstall...
2011-04-26T22:34:00.000Z	KM0201	bafilius	maybe try that.. sudo apt-get install --reinstall nautilus
