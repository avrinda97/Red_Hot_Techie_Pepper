2009-05-25T20:21:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dsdeiz	not that much
2009-05-25T20:22:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dsdeiz	try running aptitude from terminal
2009-05-25T20:22:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dsdeiz	you can run sudo aptitude install program  instead of apt-get install program.    aptitude is also meant to be better with depandanices and so better to install stuff like  xubuntu-desktop  and kubuntu-desktop  with aptitude really
2009-05-25T20:23:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dsdeiz	and  Debian which Ubuntu is based on were,  going to apparantly  replace  apt-get with aptitude, but not sure if it happended
2009-05-25T20:23:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dsdeiz	for bigger stuff sure, but otherwise apt-get should be fine
2009-05-25T20:23:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dsdeiz	or packages that have some kind of dependancy issue
2009-05-25T20:24:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dsdeiz	ok no problem
2009-08-01T08:24:00.000Z	sebsebseb	dsdeiz	nickhere got muted or something I think
2009-08-01T08:25:00.000Z	dsdeiz	sebsebseb	oh okay
