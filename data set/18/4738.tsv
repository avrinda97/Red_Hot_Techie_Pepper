2009-02-18T17:18:00.000Z	giaco_		how can I synchronize a local directory  and a remote ftp folder? (without ssh)
2009-02-18T17:19:00.000Z	p1oooop	giaco_	you can use the old copy and paste :D
2009-02-18T17:19:00.000Z	giaco_	p1oooop	funny :-D
2009-02-18T17:19:00.000Z	p1oooop	giaco_	thanks...
2009-02-18T17:20:00.000Z	p1oooop	giaco_	I think there may be a piece of software for that
2009-02-18T17:24:00.000Z	p1oooop	giaco_	coarse you can map a it as a network drive on a windows machine
2009-02-18T17:24:00.000Z	p1oooop	giaco_	then maybe rsync would work
2009-02-18T17:25:00.000Z	giaco_	p1oooop	after that, I should find a program that traces the differences between files, like rsync. Yes, that could work... let me see
2009-02-18T17:26:00.000Z	p1oooop	giaco_	maybe
2009-02-18T17:26:00.000Z	p1oooop	giaco_	I'm not entirely positive
2009-02-18T17:28:00.000Z	p1oooop	giaco_	you have to go to add network place wizard on windows in order to do that
2009-02-18T17:28:00.000Z	giaco_	p1oooop	but I've never talked about windows
2009-02-18T17:29:00.000Z	p1oooop	giaco_	ok.... windows DOES kindasuck alot
2009-02-18T17:29:00.000Z	giaco_	p1oooop	really, why should I ask in #ubuntu then?
2009-02-18T17:29:00.000Z	p1oooop	giaco_	LOL...
2009-02-18T17:30:00.000Z	p1oooop	giaco_	LOL
2009-02-18T17:31:00.000Z	p1oooop	giaco_	you can try connecting VIA connect to server
2009-02-18T17:31:00.000Z	p1oooop	giaco_	IDK how to sync from there
