2009-05-20T07:59:00.000Z	Okashi		:s updates are supposed to make things better
2009-05-20T08:01:00.000Z	Okashi		I really can't reformat, nowhere will offer me that much space for free, and I can't afford to pay
2009-05-20T08:01:00.000Z	Okashi		hm...
2009-05-20T08:02:00.000Z	Severity1	Okashi	what is wrong with your computer?
2009-05-20T08:03:00.000Z	Okashi	Severity1	: I updated Ubuntu to the newest release and it's freezing on normal boot, so I'm in failsafe and says I have no space and it won't delete anything
2009-05-20T08:05:00.000Z	Severity1	Okashi	do a df -h
2009-05-20T08:09:00.000Z	Okashi	Severity1	: what, I don't know what that means.

2009-05-20T08:11:00.000Z	Okashi	Severity1	: gui means the graphical interface right?
2009-05-20T08:12:00.000Z	Okashi	Severity1	: so bleachbit might help?
2009-05-20T08:12:00.000Z	Okashi	Severity1	: well I think so...I can still see stuff so that's a yes?
2009-05-20T08:13:00.000Z	Okashi	Severity1	: well my problem is mysterious malfunction after a failed attempt to upgrade
2009-05-20T08:32:00.000Z	Severity1	Okashi	did it work?
2009-05-20T08:32:00.000Z	Okashi	Severity1	: no sorry I can't download bleachbit
