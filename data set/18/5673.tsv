2009-11-06T12:52:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	icarus-c	do you know anything about usb d
2009-11-06T12:52:00.000Z	icarus-c	jacquesdupontd	google
2009-11-06T12:53:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	icarus-c	no google won't answer me on that thing
2009-11-06T12:53:00.000Z	icarus-c	jacquesdupontd	could you ask your question again?
2009-11-06T12:54:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	icarus-c	i'm sure that i can make the boot being fastest by telling him that i don't want to "try before intall" but just "use it"
2009-11-06T12:55:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	icarus-c	i explain myself, i don't know why i would boot with all the installation services and things if i just wanna boot, it should be as fast as my hard disk and even faster cause it's on sdd
2009-11-06T12:55:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	icarus-c	do you understand ?
2009-11-06T12:56:00.000Z	icarus-c	jacquesdupontd	how did you make your "liveusb"
2009-11-06T12:56:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	icarus-c	usb-disk-creator
2009-11-06T12:57:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	icarus-c	i know the karmic one is not working at all (shame) but i just purged it and reinstalled it and it's working perfectly
2009-11-06T12:57:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	icarus-c	first do you understand what i want ?
2009-11-06T12:57:00.000Z	icarus-c	jacquesdupontd	yea
2009-11-06T12:58:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	icarus-c	great i may finally have an answer (im sure playing with arguments would change everything, but i don't know a lot with it)
2009-11-06T13:05:00.000Z	icarus-c	jacquesdupontd	between, do you have a floppy drive? enabled floppy in BIOS but no floppy drive physically could make the kernel unhappy
2009-11-06T13:06:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	icarus-c	you all don't understand anything, EVERYTHING IS OK, just imagijne your boot time would be as long as a live cd booting time to try ubuntu would you be happy and talking about bios or floppy disk ?
2009-11-06T13:08:00.000Z	icarus-c	jacquesdupontd	between, you can install on a USB drive as hard disk
2009-11-06T13:08:00.000Z	jacquesdupontd	icarus-c	do you see you are in late look at what i said before you answered me
2009-11-06T13:09:00.000Z	icarus-c	jacquesdupontd	have fun
