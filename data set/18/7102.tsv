2008-07-24T03:26:00.000Z	PhantomFreak		why is Hardy confusing my samba drive with CIFS?
2008-07-24T03:26:00.000Z	mgreen	PhantomFreak	see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Message_Block
2008-07-24T03:28:00.000Z	mgreen	PhantomFreak	do you have a specific error message?
2008-07-24T03:30:00.000Z	PhantomFreak	mgreen	Something about negotiating unix capabilities of server... But it's not CIFS compatable and used -t smbfs and smbmount on seperate occasions!
2008-07-24T03:30:00.000Z	mgreen	PhantomFreak	tell us about your setup. you're trying to do what?
2008-07-24T03:31:00.000Z	PhantomFreak	mgreen	I've got one of those Freecom Network Drives which basically works as a Windows share on the network...
2008-07-24T03:32:00.000Z	PhantomFreak	mgreen	no passwords or anything... But we have hardware firewall so all's good!
2008-07-24T03:33:00.000Z	mgreen	PhantomFreak	have you tried smbclient?
2008-07-24T03:33:00.000Z	PhantomFreak	mgreen	yes
2008-07-24T03:35:00.000Z	mgreen	PhantomFreak	could you get a hold of that error message?
2008-07-24T03:40:00.000Z	PhantomFreak	mgreen	was just copying them... CIFS VFS: Send error in SETFSUnixInfo=-5.... CIFS VFS: Negotiating Unix Capabilities with the server failed.... Consider mounting with Unix Extensions... Malformed FILE_UNIX_BASIC_INFO... Mount error 20
2008-07-24T03:40:00.000Z	mgreen	PhantomFreak	i guess you've googled this?
2008-07-24T03:41:00.000Z	mgreen	PhantomFreak	perhaps there is a firmware upgrade? is it an old piece of hardware?
2008-07-24T03:41:00.000Z	PhantomFreak	mgreen	no only about 9 months!
2008-07-24T03:41:00.000Z	PhantomFreak	mgreen	looked for firmware before but not come accross anything useful!
2008-07-24T03:42:00.000Z	mgreen	PhantomFreak	i've never heard of this problem, and since you've googled for this already, i don't know what to do next
2008-07-24T03:43:00.000Z	mgreen	PhantomFreak	it sounds like there is a problem with the SMB/CIFS implementation of your appliance
2008-07-24T03:43:00.000Z	PhantomFreak	mgreen	Oh well, thanks for help!
