2006-07-23T16:11:00.000Z	c0de	ardchoille	How do I enable universe ?
2006-07-23T16:19:00.000Z	c0de	ardchoille	How do I enable universe. The site you gave me only told me what its about..
2006-07-23T16:20:00.000Z	ardchoille	c0de	There is a link on the page I sent you about "Managing repositories in Ubuntu"
2006-07-23T16:21:00.000Z	c0de	ardchoille	You sent me this link: http://www.ubuntulinux.nl/source-o-matic
2006-07-23T16:22:00.000Z	ardchoille	c0de	That's source-o-matic.. sorry, I must have spaced it
2006-07-23T16:23:00.000Z	ardchoille	c0de	I also sent you the !repos link ;)
2006-07-23T16:26:00.000Z	c0de	ardchoille	Ok thanks I got it :)
2006-07-23T16:26:00.000Z	ardchoille	c0de	You're welcome :)
2006-07-23T16:29:00.000Z	c0de	ardchoille	How do I make sure I'm using aterm ?
2006-07-23T16:30:00.000Z	c0de	ardchoille	I set aterm as my preferred term. Should I restart X?
2006-07-23T16:30:00.000Z	ardchoille	c0de	When you open aterm, you'll know it.. it's very different from gnome-terminal
2006-07-23T16:30:00.000Z	c0de	ardchoille	I set it as my default term, but I dont see aterm as a option from the gnome menu
2006-07-23T16:32:00.000Z	ardchoille	c0de	You might have to launch it from a gnome-terminal and you might have to create a menu item for it in alacarte
2006-07-23T16:32:00.000Z	c0de	ardchoille	Scratch that, I figured it out. lol last question - how do I get windows to remember its demensions and position ?
2006-07-23T16:34:00.000Z	ardchoille	c0de	I believe that is controlled by the window manager. in gnome, the window manager is Metacity. You could try searching in gconf-editor but I don't think there are options for all apps.
2006-07-23T16:34:00.000Z	c0de	ardchoille	Oh ok. Thanks a lot man
2006-07-23T16:35:00.000Z	ardchoille	c0de	Open a term and type  gnome-terminal --geometry 115x40  the --gometry option is useful for some apps, but others don't recognise it. You;ll just have to play with it and see.
