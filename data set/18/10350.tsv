2007-06-18T08:45:00.000Z	cute_bettong		your the one that seems to have an attitude...im just trying to get help and your calling people stupid
2007-06-18T08:45:00.000Z	cute_bettong		somehow you got your version of help way wrong
2007-06-18T08:47:00.000Z	cute_bettong		actually thats part of the problum.... i don't know anything about this network...i just moved here....
2007-06-18T08:48:00.000Z	cute_bettong		ok so let me make a clarification then... it's impossible for me to network ubuntu to a windows box.... i simply do not have the knowledge to do it...which does not make me stupid.
2007-06-18T08:48:00.000Z	cute_bettong		it's a wonder at my age i can even do it
2007-06-18T08:49:00.000Z	cute_bettong		i cannot figure out the howto for samba....you have to know something about networking to do things like that

2007-06-18T08:49:00.000Z	cute_bettong		all i did was ask for help

2007-06-18T08:52:00.000Z	n2diy	cute_bettong	So Vista was installed, and then removed?
2007-06-18T08:52:00.000Z	n2diy	cute_bettong	So what is the current OS?
2007-06-18T09:11:00.000Z	n2diy	cute_bettong	That is a good idea!
2007-06-18T09:13:00.000Z	n2diy	cute_bettong	much more secure.
