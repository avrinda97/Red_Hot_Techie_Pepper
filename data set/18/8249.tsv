2010-09-12T14:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	arooni-mobile	 visual effects can cause issues..  and slow things way down
2010-09-12T14:30:00.000Z	arooni-mobile	Dr_Willis	right; but ur saying with visual effects i cant vnc?
2010-09-12T14:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	arooni-mobile	 try it.. i bet it will be ugly
2010-09-12T14:33:00.000Z	arooni-mobile	Dr_Willis	screen doesnt refresh
2010-09-12T14:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	arooni-mobile	 im not suprised. disable compiz and see if it works
2010-09-12T14:34:00.000Z	arooni-mobile	Dr_Willis	it does; but i really like my desktop effects ;p
2010-09-12T14:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	arooni-mobile	 when using vnc - i go extreme and get a VERY minimal desktop setup. works much better that way.
2010-09-12T14:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	arooni-mobile	 vnc using icewm , or fluxbox. = much nicer
2010-09-12T14:36:00.000Z	arooni-mobile	Dr_Willis	what is icewm or fluxbox?  also is there a way to disable desktop effects temporarily from command line
