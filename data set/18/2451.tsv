2010-06-01T22:10:00.000Z	Razion		I have audio coming out of different outputs. Some programs output through the onboard sound, some through the USB headset. Any idea how to get them all to output to the headset?
2010-06-01T22:10:00.000Z	blue_anna	Razion	what's a program that's not outputing to system audio
2010-06-01T22:11:00.000Z	Razion	blue_anna	Firefox, a couple of my games.
2010-06-01T22:11:00.000Z	Razion	blue_anna	 Amarok and Dragon player go to the headset.
2010-06-01T22:12:00.000Z	Razion	blue_anna	Err. Sorry. Read the question backwards. Amarok/Dragon to USB Headset. Firefox/Games to onboard.
2010-06-01T22:12:00.000Z	blue_anna	Razion	I don't know, I certainly wasnt expecting a gnome-integrated app like firefox to not .. you know, integrate
2010-06-01T22:12:00.000Z	Razion	blue_anna	Well. I'm using KDE, so maybe it's my fault. :P
2010-06-01T22:13:00.000Z	blue_anna	Razion	you have the kde default common libs installed?
2010-06-01T22:14:00.000Z	Razion	blue_anna	Do you have a package name for that?
2010-06-01T22:14:00.000Z	blue_anna	Razion	kde..somethinsomething..base kde..somethingsomething..runtime
2010-06-01T22:14:00.000Z	blue_anna	Razion	those
2010-06-01T22:15:00.000Z	Razion	blue_anna	Lmfao. Okay, well typing "kde" into the package manager returns a bazillion results...Let me dig through them.
2010-06-01T22:18:00.000Z	Razion	blue_anna	Don't suppose you could try to find the specific names for those packages? I'm barely a quarter of the way through the list.
2010-06-01T22:19:00.000Z	blue_anna	Razion	let me ask another way, I'm feeling silly for asking it -- are you running with KDE as the wm, or just are they KDE apps in gnome ?
2010-06-01T22:20:00.000Z	Razion	blue_anna	The former. Technically, I'm using Kubuntu. *Twitches*
2010-06-01T22:21:00.000Z	blue_anna	Razion	oo man, go overe there -- they have their own channel -- its a different server, but it's installed by default in konversation
2010-06-01T22:21:00.000Z	Razion	blue_anna	I'm in that channel, too. They're not so helpful. :P
2010-06-01T22:23:00.000Z	Razion	blue_anna	You'd think working audio would come with the bloody OS. :P
