2006-06-09T10:46:00.000Z	Jemt	uglymonke	Running DHCP ?
2006-06-09T10:46:00.000Z	Jemt	uglymonke	Is your network card listed in 'ifconfig -a' ?
2006-06-09T10:47:00.000Z	Jemt	uglymonke	Can you ping your gateway ?
2006-06-09T10:48:00.000Z	Jemt	uglymonke	255... is your submask
2006-06-09T10:48:00.000Z	Jemt	uglymonke	Can you ping your gateway ?
2006-06-09T10:50:00.000Z	uglymonke	Jemt	not easy to get your help when im in ubuntu at the time being :)
2006-06-09T10:50:00.000Z	Jemt	uglymonke	I would first check that the network card is present (ifconfig -a), that it is configured, that you can ping the gateway. One of these steps probably fails
2006-06-09T10:50:00.000Z	Jemt	uglymonke	True :)
2006-06-09T10:51:00.000Z	uglymonke	Jemt	first step works. i tried it. if second step fails where shoul i look for answer?
2006-06-09T10:52:00.000Z	Jemt	uglymonke	No idea. Could be a driver issue - havn't experienced any such problems with Ubuntu. It has quite a large database of drivers. Do you know what chipset your card is based on ?
2006-06-09T10:52:00.000Z	Jemt	uglymonke	SIS is known to be very Windows-only
2006-06-09T10:53:00.000Z	uglymonke	Jemt	nforce4 but internet was working before - htts how i got the new kernel :)
2006-06-09T10:53:00.000Z	Jemt	uglymonke	Ohh, I see
2006-06-09T10:53:00.000Z	Jemt	uglymonke	Why are you messing with the kernel ?
2006-06-09T10:55:00.000Z	uglymonke	Jemt	messing :) ? i found tips on how to speed ubu and kernel choice was one-- everyone else on the thread seemed to have 0 probs...
2006-06-09T10:59:00.000Z	Jemt	uglymonke	Ah, ok. Well, I would just leave the kernel as is if I were you :)
2006-06-09T13:03:00.000Z	Jemt	uglymonke	Don't think I can help you any further - except advice you not to tweak the kernel - it is perfectly fine as it is :)
