2010-07-02T18:15:00.000Z	norbi905		It seems like i'm biting off a little more than what I can chew.  I also have to specify the partition size.  How large of a /boot partition would I need?
2010-07-02T18:17:00.000Z	arand	norbi905	Are you sure you want a separate boot partition? (It is not neccessary), 500MB might be a precautius size if you do make one..
2010-07-02T18:19:00.000Z	norbi905	arand	Yes, i'm trying to figure out seperating OS stuff from user data and put OS related things onto a small SSD.  Seems a bit tougher than I thought.
2010-07-02T18:20:00.000Z	arand	norbi905	Would not separating /home and / be suficcient for that?
2010-07-02T18:23:00.000Z	norbi905	arand	I don't know, i'm looking for suggestions :).  Fairly new to Linux sorry.
2010-07-02T18:28:00.000Z	arand	norbi905	/home/username will contain all the users individaul configuration and data. So that is the normal separation.
2010-07-02T18:29:00.000Z	arand	norbi905	Oh, heh, you don't nee dtha guide though, if you setup that at install time already...
2010-07-02T18:30:00.000Z	norbi905	arand	Since there are now 2 drives connected sda is the SSD and sdb is the 250GB regular drive.  I have made 240GB /home and 10GB swap.  That drive now has 2 partitions as is full.  Is it now safe to assume that since there is no more space available on that drive, that all other stuff will go onto the SSD?  Such as / /boot /bin etc..?
2010-07-02T18:31:00.000Z	arand	norbi905	if you are doing the partitioning manually you need to specify this.. manually
2010-07-02T18:31:00.000Z	norbi905	arand	I was affraid of that.  Thank you
2010-07-02T18:33:00.000Z	norbi905	arand	However, would it not be enough to specify / partition for SSD?  Does that not include all others such as /bin /usr /var?  I would hardly think that you'd have to specify each of those.
2010-07-02T18:34:00.000Z	arand	norbi905	Yes, if you set / for that disk it will pick up everything except /home, or anything else you specify particularly somewhere else.
2010-07-02T18:35:00.000Z	norbi905	arand	Thanks, that makes life easier.  So before I wipe my existing drives I'd like to make sure I have it set-up properly.  My 250GB has a /home and swap partition.  I then created the SSD with mount / .  So i'm under the assumption that everything other than /home will go on SSD.  Is this a good idea or am I barking up the wrong tree?
2010-07-02T18:36:00.000Z	arand	norbi905	Correct.
2010-07-02T18:37:00.000Z	norbi905	arand	Thanks, here goes nothing :)
2010-07-02T18:38:00.000Z	norbi905	arand	Hmm, I missed that one.  Well it's formated now, how hard would it be to move /tmp over? Or is it even possible?
2010-07-02T18:43:00.000Z	arand	norbi905	Shouldn't be too hard I don't think, just create a new partition with ext4 (or other FS if you care), and specify it as the mount point for /tmp in /etc/fstab, and then I think it should be picked up at next boot...
2010-07-02T18:43:00.000Z	norbi905	arand	Sounds good, thanks for the help.
