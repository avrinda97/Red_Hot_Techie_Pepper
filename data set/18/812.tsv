2011-10-02T14:17:00.000Z	Neroon		Hi there. Anyone here that might help with a problem with dualbooting ubuntu/xp using grub2?
2011-10-02T14:19:00.000Z	Stanley00	Neroon	what's your problem exactly?
2011-10-02T14:20:00.000Z	Neroon	Stanley00	Ubuntu boots fine, XP just gives me the blinking cursor and I've been trying almost everything for 3 days now (almost nonstop)
2011-10-02T14:21:00.000Z	Neroon	Stanley00	XP is on sda2, ubuntu on sda1
2011-10-02T14:22:00.000Z	Stanley00	Neroon	hmm, blink cursor for XP, look like some XP issue...
2011-10-02T14:23:00.000Z	Neroon	Stanley00	No it isnt, since I tried a clone of it on a separate hdd as primary sda1 and it works
2011-10-02T14:24:00.000Z	Stanley00	Neroon	hmm, yes, that's exactly the microsoft problem, it wont boot on the second primary partition :))
2011-10-02T14:25:00.000Z	Neroon	Stanley00	Thanks, Captain Obvious ;-) But there has to be a solution regarding grub2
2011-10-02T14:27:00.000Z	Stanley00	Neroon	lol, there's an option in grub to remap partition, dont know if grub2 has it...
2011-10-02T14:27:00.000Z	Neroon	Stanley00	grub1 had map, grub2 has devicemap but i found only how to remap 2 different hdds
2011-10-02T14:29:00.000Z	Neroon	Stanley00	so the line in grub.cfg I tried was devicemap (hd0) (hd1) but imho that only would map harddisk 1 to harddisk 2
2011-10-02T14:29:00.000Z	Neroon	Stanley00	And I can't find any detailed information about devicemap anywhere ...
2011-10-02T14:30:00.000Z	Stanley00	Neroon	yep, I'm finding nothing here, too.
2011-10-02T14:30:00.000Z	Neroon	Stanley00	Thank god it's not me ;-)
2011-10-02T14:31:00.000Z	Neroon	Stanley00	god, how i hate grub2 ... I would go back to grub if it weren't for burg
2011-10-02T14:32:00.000Z	Stanley00	Neroon	can you pastebin your grub.cfg?
2011-10-02T14:34:00.000Z	Neroon	Stanley00	Actually, I can't since it's my 2nd pc and oh overjoy: my Main Monitor with 2 connectors went down the drain 5 days ago
2011-10-02T14:34:00.000Z	Neroon	Stanley00	So I would have to disconnect this pc, and reconnect the other one, booting, copying, pasting
