2008-03-27T05:04:00.000Z	ls1024		Does anybody know why a monitor would blink (black screen) after Xorg starts up? But if I turn off and back on the monitor, it fixes the problem?
2008-03-27T05:04:00.000Z	Marupa	ls1024	do you have compiz installed?
2008-03-27T05:04:00.000Z	ls1024	Marupa	Indeed.
2008-03-27T05:04:00.000Z	Marupa	ls1024	then that's normal.
2008-03-27T05:05:00.000Z	Marupa	ls1024	Normal as in it's switching from metacity to compiz.
2008-03-27T05:05:00.000Z	Marupa	ls1024	like, it won't stop happening until you turn your monitor off then back on?
2008-03-27T05:06:00.000Z	ls1024	Marupa	Yes.
2008-03-27T05:06:00.000Z	Marupa	ls1024	Hmmm.  That sounds like a possible resolution problem.  Is it CRT or LCD?
2008-03-27T05:06:00.000Z	ls1024	Marupa	LCD, running at native res.
2008-03-27T05:06:00.000Z	Marupa	ls1024	Not sure then.  Nvidia or ATI?
2008-03-27T05:06:00.000Z	ls1024	Marupa	Intel 3100.
2008-03-27T05:07:00.000Z	Marupa	ls1024	Not sure about intel cards.  I know nVidia and ATI work fine though.  Never had a problem with them.  Could be a funky driver.
2008-03-27T05:07:00.000Z	ls1024	Marupa	That's what I was thinking too.
2008-03-27T05:07:00.000Z	Marupa	ls1024	How old is the graphics card?
2008-03-27T05:07:00.000Z	ls1024	Marupa	Around mid-last year.
2008-03-27T05:11:00.000Z	Marupa	ls1024	Huh?  My disks mount automatically in livecd.
2008-03-27T05:12:00.000Z	ls1024	Marupa	All partitions?
2008-03-27T05:12:00.000Z	Marupa	ls1024	Well, no.  Just the primaries.
