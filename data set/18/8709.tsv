2009-06-25T03:51:00.000Z	derenrich	Prankster163	you have to restart? killing x won't help for example?
2009-06-25T03:52:00.000Z	derenrich	Prankster163	they want you to write "name: whatever" whenever you say things here to unclutter the conversation
2009-06-25T03:54:00.000Z	derenrich	Prankster163	killing x means going to the command line (you can do this without a mouse) and typing "sudo killall gdm" or something like that
2009-06-25T03:55:00.000Z	derenrich	Prankster163	lots of ways
2009-06-25T03:55:00.000Z	derenrich	Prankster163	Ctrl+Alt+F1 for example
2009-06-25T03:55:00.000Z	derenrich	Prankster163	Alt+F2 is also good
2009-06-25T03:56:00.000Z	derenrich	Prankster163	Alt+F2 is like the run prompt in windows
2009-06-25T03:56:00.000Z	derenrich	Prankster163	?
