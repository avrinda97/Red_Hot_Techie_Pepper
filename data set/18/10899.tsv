2006-10-11T07:11:00.000Z	BlueEagle	pls	How old is the cd-rom in that other machine?
2006-10-11T07:11:00.000Z	BlueEagle	pls	Old CD-roms had a weaker lazer and are less willing to read burned CDs.
2006-10-11T07:12:00.000Z	pls	BlueEagle	its a 52x CD-ROM
2006-10-11T07:12:00.000Z	pls	BlueEagle	its a 52x CD-ROM Drive.
2006-10-11T07:12:00.000Z	BlueEagle	pls	You might also want to use a lense cleaner of sorts. You could always try moving the cd-rom drive that you know to work over.
2006-10-11T07:13:00.000Z	pls	BlueEagle	its crossed my mind :)
2006-10-11T07:13:00.000Z	pls	BlueEagle	taking CD-ROM Drive into other machine
