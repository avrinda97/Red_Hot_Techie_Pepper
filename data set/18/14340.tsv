2009-10-01T00:51:00.000Z	Guest99483		can anyone explain this to me?
2009-10-01T00:51:00.000Z	Guest99483		bash: ./run.sh: /bin/sh^M: bad interpreter: No such file or directory
2009-10-01T00:51:00.000Z	Chousuke	Guest99483	your file has DOS endline characters.
2009-10-01T00:51:00.000Z	Chousuke	Guest99483	use dos2unix to convert to unix endlines
2009-10-01T00:53:00.000Z	Chousuke	Guest99483	you can also just do "sh run.sh"
2009-10-01T00:54:00.000Z	Chousuke	Guest99483	with or without the quotes? :P
2009-10-01T00:54:00.000Z	Chousuke	Guest99483	hm. so which command does it complain about?
2009-10-01T00:55:00.000Z	Chousuke	Guest99483	... huh.
2009-10-01T00:56:00.000Z	Chousuke	Guest99483	what about "bash run.sh" (without quotes)
2009-10-01T01:04:00.000Z	Chousuke	Guest99483	it has a DOS line ending
2009-10-01T01:04:00.000Z	Chousuke	Guest99483	it should be a unix line ending
2009-10-01T01:04:00.000Z	Chousuke	Guest99483	it's what you get with enter :)
2009-10-01T01:04:00.000Z	Chousuke	Guest99483	for historical reasons, there are two different characters for "line end"
2009-10-01T01:04:00.000Z	Chousuke	Guest99483	yep
2009-10-01T01:06:00.000Z	Chousuke	Guest99483	now it's working
2009-10-01T01:06:00.000Z	Chousuke	Guest99483	next: install java
2009-10-01T01:09:00.000Z	Chousuke	Guest99483	using sudo when you don't need it makes you prone to sticking it in front of every command
2009-10-01T01:09:00.000Z	Chousuke	Guest99483	and that can actually *break* thing, never mind the security isseu
