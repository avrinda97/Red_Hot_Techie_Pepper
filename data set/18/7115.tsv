2008-04-26T03:16:00.000Z	mtaylor		hey guys - anything know anything about ssh X11 forwarding in hardy?
2008-04-26T03:16:00.000Z	mtaylor		my hardy client machine doesn't seem to be doing it, even if I ssh -X
2008-04-26T03:16:00.000Z	amenado	mtaylor	should be same as in gutsy
2008-04-26T03:22:00.000Z	amenado	mtaylor	what is the issue? i came in late to the convo
2008-04-26T03:22:00.000Z	mtaylor	amenado	ssh -X isn't forwarding my X traffic
2008-04-26T03:23:00.000Z	amenado	mtaylor	are you getting any kind of error?
2008-04-26T03:24:00.000Z	mtaylor	amenado	ssh -X mordred@camelot xterm
2008-04-26T03:25:00.000Z	amenado	mtaylor	the camelot host is the new ubuntu 8.04 ?
2008-04-26T03:25:00.000Z	mtaylor	amenado	nope, camelot is running lenny. the client host is hardy
2008-04-26T03:26:00.000Z	amenado	mtaylor	let me try that..i have just installed Hardy
2008-04-26T03:27:00.000Z	amenado	mtaylor	no problem here,  hardy ssh client into gutsy..forwarding X
2008-04-26T03:27:00.000Z	mtaylor	amenado	ok. thanks!
2008-04-26T03:27:00.000Z	mtaylor	amenado	I'll keep checking my setup
2008-04-26T03:30:00.000Z	amenado	mtaylor	ahh, that surely will prevent you from getting in
2008-04-26T03:31:00.000Z	mtaylor	amenado	can you do "ls /usr/bin/X11/xauth" for me?
2008-04-26T03:31:00.000Z	amenado	mtaylor	on hardy?
2008-04-26T03:31:00.000Z	mtaylor	amenado	nevermind... I thought mine was missing, just slow tab completion
2008-04-26T03:33:00.000Z	mtaylor	amenado	I didn't have xauth on the server, I should clarify
