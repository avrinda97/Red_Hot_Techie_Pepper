2008-10-08T02:49:00.000Z	bla1		does anyone know how i use the latest gparted to set mount points? I don't have the option?
2008-10-08T02:49:00.000Z	bla1		Sorry, i mean to say, My gparted booted into the live cd will not let me set mount points for some reason, do i have something not enabled that i need enabled to do this?... better way to ask the question
2008-10-08T02:51:00.000Z	FatalError	bla1	I don't know that it makes sense for gparted to set mount points from there.. to do that it would have to access your /etc/fstab on your linux install.. and if it's the standalone gparted livecd I'm not sure I'd expect it to do that
2008-10-08T02:51:00.000Z	FatalError	bla1	unless you mean gparted on the ubuntu livecd
2008-10-08T02:51:00.000Z	bla1	FatalError	yes that is what I am using
2008-10-08T02:51:00.000Z	FatalError	bla1	which?
2008-10-08T02:52:00.000Z	bla1	FatalError	I have resized and moved my ubuntu partition, making room for NTFS in front of it.. but I can't set /boot as a mount point for a 50 mb partition i made or set a /home partition mount point
2008-10-08T02:52:00.000Z	bla1		The gparted on the ubuntu livecd
2008-10-08T02:52:00.000Z	FatalError	bla1	ah ok.  Hm.  It's strange, ut you can always do this yourself later by changing /etc/fstab
2008-10-08T02:52:00.000Z	bla1		oh
2008-10-08T02:52:00.000Z	bla1	FatalError	so just create the partitions now and do it later with fstab?
2008-10-08T02:53:00.000Z	FatalError	bla1	sure
2008-10-08T02:53:00.000Z	bla1	FatalError	will do
2008-10-08T02:53:00.000Z	bla1	FatalError	Thank you very much
2008-10-08T02:53:00.000Z	FatalError	bla1	now mind you ubuntu uses UUIDs usually, so it's a little different from your typical /etc/fstab, but entirely doable
2008-10-08T02:54:00.000Z	bla1	FatalError	will you be around for another hour possibly, because I may need you to help me with that ;D
2008-10-08T02:55:00.000Z	FatalError	bla1	I'll be on and off -- someone else probably will know if I'm not, or if all else fails you can drop me a PM
2008-10-08T02:55:00.000Z	bla1	FatalError	Ok, sounds good
