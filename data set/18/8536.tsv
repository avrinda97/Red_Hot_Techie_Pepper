2007-11-05T20:57:00.000Z	jamili	frenchy	yes, before i installed realtek's hda drivers and rebooted :|
2007-11-05T20:57:00.000Z	frenchy	jamili	have you uninstalled relteks drivers
2007-11-05T20:58:00.000Z	jamili	frenchy	i don't know how to since the install doesn't have uninstallation option
2007-11-05T20:59:00.000Z	frenchy	jamili	have you tried loading the alsa modules manually with modprobe?
2007-11-05T20:59:00.000Z	jamili	frenchy	and the readme doesn't say anything about uninstalling
2007-11-05T20:59:00.000Z	jamili	frenchy	no and i have no idea how, i just installed ubuntu yesterday :O
2007-11-05T21:00:00.000Z	jamili	frenchy	i also tried to search for this problem in ubuntuforums & google but i don't really have any idea what to search for
