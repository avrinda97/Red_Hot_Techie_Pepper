2007-07-19T13:51:00.000Z	osfameron		how do I get mutt to use my email address in From and Reply-To?
2007-07-19T13:51:00.000Z	osfameron		I've set "from", "envelope_from" and "hidden_host"...
2007-07-19T13:51:00.000Z	osfameron		(cargo culted from someone else's muttrc, but I'm still seeing   osfameron@myhostname  as the from and reply-to address...)
2007-07-19T13:51:00.000Z	MajorPayne	osfameron	try use_from="yes"
2007-07-19T13:52:00.000Z	osfameron	MajorPayne	ah, ok - I wondered about that, but man muttrc suggested it was the default... I'll try!
2007-07-19T13:52:00.000Z	MajorPayne		envelope_from should be set to yes and from should be your email.
2007-07-19T13:53:00.000Z	MajorPayne	osfameron	I am just looking at my .muttrc.  I hope that works for you (That's what I have).
2007-07-19T13:53:00.000Z	osfameron	MajorPayne	yes!  that seems to work
2007-07-19T13:54:00.000Z	MajorPayne	osfameron	Good.
2007-07-19T13:54:00.000Z	osfameron	MajorPayne	I also had 'set envelope_from' instead of 'set envelope_from="yes"', maybe that was from a different version of config... seems fine with that change and the use_from
2007-07-19T13:54:00.000Z	MajorPayne	osfameron	If I remember corretly "set envelope_from="yes"" is the same as "set envelope_from".  The same as unset and no.
2007-07-19T13:55:00.000Z	osfameron		now if only I could work out how to get offlineimap to talk to fastmail.fm without crashing out, then I could go through the "fun" of setting up different accounts with the same address..
2007-07-19T13:55:00.000Z	MajorPayne	osfameron	Ahh, I can't help you there.  Maybe #mutt may help.
2007-07-19T13:55:00.000Z	osfameron	MajorPayne	yeah, that's waht I'd guessed.  In which case it's only the "use_from" setting that was missing (and the manual is then maybe incorrect?  or perhaps a system wide config somewhere disabled it?)
2007-07-19T13:56:00.000Z	osfameron	MajorPayne	oh, good idea, ta!
2007-07-19T13:56:00.000Z	MajorPayne	osfameron	Not sure, you can check your /etc/Muttrc
2007-07-19T13:56:00.000Z	MajorPayne	osfameron	I am not Mutt expert.  I got it to do what I wanted it to do and I didn't touch it since.
2007-07-19T13:57:00.000Z	osfameron	MajorPayne	yeah, that's my philosophy too :-)
