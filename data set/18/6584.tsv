2008-11-03T11:26:00.000Z	rfxcasey		where can I go to get answers about connection problems
2008-11-03T11:27:00.000Z	rfxcasey		I though ubuntu was suppost to "just work" I can't connect to my network
2008-11-03T11:27:00.000Z	RyanPrior	rfxcasey	Naturally we want Ubuntu to "just work"
2008-11-03T11:28:00.000Z	RyanPrior	rfxcasey	However, we always have problems. If you give us as much info as possible, we can hopefully help you work past yourts.
2008-11-03T11:29:00.000Z	rfxcasey	RyanPrior	I just installed ubuntu on my spare machine. I run it on my main machine and it worked out the box but with my other machine I don't get an ip address
2008-11-03T11:29:00.000Z	RyanPrior	rfxcasey	You're using DHPC I assume?
2008-11-03T11:29:00.000Z	rfxcasey	RyanPrior	yes sir
2008-11-03T11:30:00.000Z	RyanPrior	rfxcasey	So one box gets an IP but the other doesn't - perhaps ask in #networking, unless you've got some reason to be sure it's a NetworkManager problem.
2008-11-03T11:32:00.000Z	rfxcasey	RyanPrior	well ubuntu sees my network card, and tries to connect when I plug in my network cable to the back of the machine, but it never gets an ip. I just install ubuntu over kubuntu and kubuntu connected just fine
2008-11-03T11:33:00.000Z	RyanPrior	rfxcasey	can the LiveCD connect? The Kubuntu 8.10 LiveCD?
2008-11-03T11:34:00.000Z	rfxcasey	RyanPrior	I will try
2008-11-03T11:35:00.000Z	rfxcasey	RyanPrior	hey say my name again
2008-11-03T11:35:00.000Z	RyanPrior	rfxcasey	rfxcasey rfxcasey rfxcasey
2008-11-03T11:35:00.000Z	rfxcasey	RyanPrior	ok ok it still works
2008-11-03T11:40:00.000Z	rfxcasey	RyanPrior	I don't have the live cd I have the alternate install version
2008-11-03T11:41:00.000Z	RyanPrior	rfxcasey	time to fire up ye bittorrent?
