2005-03-24T14:47:00.000Z	mario8723		Question for anybody...noob here
2005-03-24T14:49:00.000Z	mario8723		I just downloaded Gnomebaker
2005-03-24T14:49:00.000Z	mario8723		Tried installing, but getting an error saying I don't have compiler package?
2005-03-24T14:49:00.000Z	mario8723		I know I'm missing something
2005-03-24T14:49:00.000Z	eb0x	mario8723	Which package?
2005-03-24T14:49:00.000Z	eb0x	mario8723	According to the error, which package are you missing?
2005-03-24T14:56:00.000Z	eb0x	mario8723	Give me one sec to look that up for you
2005-03-24T14:57:00.000Z	eb0x	mario8723	 Yes
2005-03-24T14:58:00.000Z	eb0x	mario8723	apt-get install libgnomeui-2.0
2005-03-24T14:58:00.000Z	eb0x	mario8723	try that
2005-03-24T14:59:00.000Z	eb0x	mario8723	Try apt-get install libgnomeui-dev
2005-03-24T15:02:00.000Z	eb0x	mario8723	Also bookmark www.ubuntuguide.org
2005-03-24T15:02:00.000Z	eb0x	mario8723	You're welcome
2005-03-24T15:03:00.000Z	eb0x	mario8723	try ./configure again
2005-03-24T15:05:00.000Z	eb0x	mario8723	Do you know how to use Synaptic Package Manager?
2005-03-24T15:10:00.000Z	eb0x	mario8723	For the most part, most things installed you will need to ./configure then make then sudo make install
2005-03-24T15:10:00.000Z	eb0x	mario8723	which can also be done in one line as Agrajag said by typing ./configure && make && sudo make install
