2008-01-25T03:43:00.000Z	bkar		orion1-> maybe, i have not done it for a while, plenty of tutorials out there
2008-01-25T03:44:00.000Z	bkar		makasd0-> it may have been installed, which package was it?
2008-01-25T03:46:00.000Z	bkar		makasd0-> okay, well then did you test those package if they will run?
2008-01-25T03:46:00.000Z	bkar		bieb-> do you really want the xp back of want to stay with ubuntu?
2008-01-25T03:47:00.000Z	bkar		makasd0-> well try running your apache and those apps okay?
2008-01-25T03:48:00.000Z	bkar		bieb-> i suggest, you load ubuntu, then virtualbox and then load xp or several other os on virtual box, problem maybe solved!
2008-01-25T03:49:00.000Z	bkar		bieb-> that will give her access to several os'es
2008-01-25T03:50:00.000Z	bkar		makasd0-> its not that hard really, spend some time reading linux books too, you will pick up pointers here and there

2008-01-25T03:53:00.000Z	fxd_	bkar	i have followed a forum guide and from the terminal I have downloaded drivers and installed ndiswrapper but then I can't get the driver to install
2008-01-25T03:54:00.000Z	fxd_	bkar	I am attempting this step: sudo ndiswrapper -i net8185.inf
2008-01-25T03:56:00.000Z	fxd_	bkar	yeah, the file is rtl8185.sys and it's in the same directory as net8185.inf
2008-01-25T03:57:00.000Z	fxd_	bkar	aaron@jean-pierre:/$ sudo ndiswrapper -i net8185.inf
2008-01-25T04:14:00.000Z	fxd_	bkar	well, now I've got to take care of stuff, if you get back on and see this, I should probably only be 5 minutes
