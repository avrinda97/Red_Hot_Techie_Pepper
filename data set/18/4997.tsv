2009-01-03T15:00:00.000Z	Calaaros		What I don't understand is, if Ubuntu can play that drumming thing when I go to log in, how come it can't play anything else?

2009-01-03T15:10:00.000Z	Calaaros	miranda_psi	Still no sound, even after removing all that Pulse Audio stuff.
2009-01-03T15:11:00.000Z	miranda_psi	Calaaros	try running alsamixer -c 0 and making sure everything is on
2009-01-03T15:13:00.000Z	Calaaros	miranda_psi	Everything is up. Still no sound. :P
2009-01-03T15:15:00.000Z	miranda_psi	Calaaros	so it works when you log in, but stops after that?
2009-01-03T15:16:00.000Z	Calaaros	miranda_psi	I just meant, that log-on noise comes through my headphones fine, but once I'm in Ubuntu itself, I can't get sound from anywhere.
2009-01-03T15:19:00.000Z	Calaaros	miranda_psi	mplayer no, but I installed VLC.
2009-01-03T15:20:00.000Z	miranda_psi	Calaaros	can you install mplayer? might be able to get some information from it
2009-01-03T15:24:00.000Z	Calaaros	miranda_psi	Is mplayer the same as Totem Movie Player?
2009-01-03T15:24:00.000Z	miranda_psi	Calaaros	no - the totem player uses gstreamer by default and there is also a xine version as well
2009-01-03T15:25:00.000Z	Calaaros	miranda_psi	Okay, so what did you want me to do in mplayer?
2009-01-03T15:25:00.000Z	miranda_psi	Calaaros	its available in the repository - just go into the synaptic package manager and search for mplayer
2009-01-03T15:25:00.000Z	miranda_psi	Calaaros	thats fine - its a commandline movie player, though you can get guis for it
2009-01-03T15:26:00.000Z	miranda_psi	Calaaros	try: mplayer -ao alsa:device=hw=0 somemediafile
2009-01-03T15:29:00.000Z	Calaaros	miranda_psi	I can play music through mplayer. :D
2009-01-03T15:30:00.000Z	miranda_psi	Calaaros	thats great to hear - go to system, preferences, sound and set everything to alsa and see if that works for you
2009-01-03T15:34:00.000Z	Calaaros	miranda_psi	Thanks for your help. :) Appears that the audio channel was "Analogue Front"... but I still can't seem to play anything in VLC.
