2009-09-18T11:04:00.000Z	bhaka		after enabling restricted drivers, my ubuntu 9.04 wont open gdm - it just shows a black screen. What should I do?
2009-09-18T11:06:00.000Z	fallenpoet	bhaka	| you can reconfigure the xserver using the fallowing command sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2009-09-18T11:20:00.000Z	bhaka	fallenpoet	did not help, i left most of the options to default, but it still gives me a black screen ;(
2009-09-18T11:21:00.000Z	fallenpoet	bhaka	| did you try to using a diffrent screen?
2009-09-18T11:22:00.000Z	bhaka	fallenpoet	its a laptop, but its working fine showing bios and grub doing its stuff
2009-09-18T11:23:00.000Z	bhaka	fallenpoet	its not even letting me to open a normal terminal, so this is kinda new to me
2009-09-18T11:25:00.000Z	fallenpoet	bhaka	| the resolution might be higher then you screen can support
2009-09-18T11:26:00.000Z	fallenpoet	bhaka	| when you were reconfiguring did you pick the vga driver?
2009-09-18T11:27:00.000Z	bhaka	fallenpoet	bhaka | the resolution might be higher then you screen can support <- it would still allow me to open a normal terminal with alt+ctrl+F1
2009-09-18T11:28:00.000Z	bhaka	fallenpoet	bhaka | when you were reconfiguring did you pick the vga driver? <- no, there was no such option. Ill recheck
2009-09-18T11:29:00.000Z	bhaka	fallenpoet	it only asks if i wanna use the kernel framebuffer (A=yes), after that all the questions regard only the keyboard
2009-09-18T11:30:00.000Z	fallenpoet	bhaka	| try this command which should change the resolution to 1024 by 760  xrandr -s 1024x760
2009-09-18T11:34:00.000Z	bhaka	fallenpoet	it did not help. It might not be able to select my laptops keyboard or screen, cause even the capslock key doesnt do anything
2009-09-18T11:35:00.000Z	fallenpoet	bhaka	| that graphic card you have and which driver did you try to install?
2009-09-18T11:37:00.000Z	bhaka	fallenpoet	 ATI Mobility Radeon HD3650 and I downloaded its driver via the restricted driver manager - however, i had automatically installed some nvidia drivers, because i cloned my old laptop. After installing the ATI driver, I went to a restart and this happened. I have now removed nvidia drivers, but it had no effect :S
2009-09-18T11:41:00.000Z	fallenpoet		bhaha | most likely you will need to play with the xorg config file. this web site might help http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu
2009-09-18T11:43:00.000Z	bhaka	fallenpoet	thx, ill look into it
2009-09-18T11:44:00.000Z	fallenpoet	bhaka	| or if you don't need 3d acceleration you might want to try the open source ati driver
