2009-10-11T04:38:00.000Z	Pyrophelia		or I guess the most important question, is that even possible?

2009-10-11T04:39:00.000Z	WanHouse	Pyrophelia	?
2009-10-11T04:41:00.000Z	WanHouse	Pyrophelia	Its called bondig
2009-10-11T04:41:00.000Z	WanHouse	Pyrophelia	Its called bonding
2009-10-11T04:42:00.000Z	WanHouse	Pyrophelia	Why anyone wouldnt want to utilize full internet speed at all times ill never understand.
2009-10-11T04:42:00.000Z	Pyrophelia	WanHouse	i'm pretty sure that's different
2009-10-11T04:42:00.000Z	WanHouse	Pyrophelia	Why ?
2009-10-11T04:44:00.000Z	Pyrophelia	WanHouse	I will be binding 2 gigE cards to our switch using LACP (Link Aggregation Control Protocol), but that is only possible because I control the switch.  the cable modems are different because I have no access to the circuit they connect to so I can't use them like T1 circuits
2009-10-11T04:46:00.000Z	WanHouse	Pyrophelia	Its like for security ? To be able to remove a line and avoid something else affecting nets ?
2009-10-11T04:48:00.000Z	Pyrophelia	WanHouse	we don't need redundancy, it's a relatively stable connection.  but it's cable so it gets bogged down pretty quick.  I'd like the router to load balance the cable modems so when 1 modem reaches it's peak bandwidth the router directs traffic at the other modem.  Or when somebody needs to send a critical upload, nobody else can use the modem the uploader needs
2009-10-11T04:49:00.000Z	Pyrophelia	WanHouse	we use comcast at our office and the upload service is terrible.  if somebody starts to download anything (www.google.com) when your uploading, the upload stream drops to ~4KBps or less.  and takes a very long time for it to reach a respectable speed again
2009-10-11T04:50:00.000Z	WanHouse	Pyrophelia	Ouch ;) ... Ok, then bonding (etherbonding) could be neat.
2009-10-11T04:51:00.000Z	Pyrophelia	WanHouse	I would love to etherbond the modems, but my understanding of the technology means I can't bond cable modems unless I get access to the circuit on comcasts side, which will never happen
2009-10-11T04:51:00.000Z	Pyrophelia	WanHouse	they're already trying to sell us a fractional T1 for $700/month
2009-10-11T04:52:00.000Z	WanHouse	Pyrophelia	Hefty note. google for the bonding. Its not that hard
2009-10-11T04:52:00.000Z	Pyrophelia	WanHouse	I know how to etherbond, what I'm saying is I can't do that to cable modems.  that is unless my understanding is radically missinformed
2009-10-11T04:55:00.000Z	WanHouse	Pyrophelia	Degrade/Upgrade/etcgrade as it suits your setup.
