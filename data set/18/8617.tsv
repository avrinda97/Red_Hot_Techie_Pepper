2007-08-01T14:27:00.000Z	WGGM1		is there a way to remove the timer on GRUB and just make it go directly to a GRUB screen
2007-08-01T14:27:00.000Z	Marfi	WGGM1	yes. go to /boot/grub, and edit the grup bile
2007-08-01T14:27:00.000Z	Marfi		*file
2007-08-01T14:27:00.000Z	WGGM1		alright, im not sure on the particular line though
2007-08-01T14:28:00.000Z	Marfi	WGGM1	edit menu.lst, and scroll down to the timeout line, and change the timeout to whatever you want it to
2007-08-01T14:28:00.000Z	WGGM1	Marfi	you sure its boot/grub
2007-08-01T14:28:00.000Z	Marfi	WGGM1	yes
2007-08-01T14:30:00.000Z	WGGM1	Marfi	ok im not sure the timeout line will do what i want though, i still want it to time out to the default select, but when i boot, it is just a black screen and it says hit ESC to select before the timeout. I dont want that screen but I want it to go to the select screen with the different kernels, so I can put a GRUB splash in the background
2007-08-01T14:31:00.000Z	WGGM1	Marfi	can i just make hiddenmenu=false or just remove hiddemenu because i think thats the line i need
2007-08-01T14:32:00.000Z	Marfi	WGGM1	you want the grub menu to have a splash screen?
2007-08-01T14:33:00.000Z	WGGM1	Marfi	yes, i dont want to have to hit ESC to see the kernel selections either
2007-08-01T14:33:00.000Z	Marfi	WGGM1	check this website here. http://ubuntu.wordpress.com/2006/03/21/add-a-grub-splash-image/ it shows how to give it a splash screen. =)
2007-08-01T14:34:00.000Z	WGGM1	Marfi	thanks mate, i appreciate it
2007-08-01T14:34:00.000Z	Marfi	WGGM1	as for hitting escape, let me look through mine really fast. i don't, since i have 2 OS's on my lapytop
2007-08-01T14:34:00.000Z	Marfi	WGGM1	do you have hiddenmenu commented out?
2007-08-01T14:34:00.000Z	WGGM1	Marfi	ok, i believe its the hiddenmenu line, I just commented it out but im in the middle of a compile so no restart time hehe
2007-08-01T14:35:00.000Z	Marfi	WGGM1	mine is commented out. so that should do it for ya!  =)
2007-08-01T14:35:00.000Z	WGGM1	Marfi	awesome, thanks a bunch
