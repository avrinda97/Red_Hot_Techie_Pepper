2008-12-05T15:55:00.000Z	wiehan		If I install a VERY light window manager on ubuntu such as xnomad or jwm, and still use gnome applications, such as gnome-games, would that be defeating the whole point of switching to a light window manager, because running a gnome game will place the gnome libraries in memory and will result in no real speed increase???
2008-12-05T15:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	wiehan	The graphics will be lighter for your desktop apps and so the desktop will be snappier
2008-12-05T15:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	wiehan	not sure about gnome games
2008-12-05T16:00:00.000Z	wiehan	ActionParsnip1	well, any gnome app for arguments sake; and what do you mean the graphics will be lighter - I want the trechincal answer, wouldn't opening a gnome application cause that the gnome libraries will be loaded into the RAM (and especially on a very old computer, with very little RAM - that would be a problem), or am I misunderstanding something? Let me ask this subjectively as well: will there be a bug speed increase running gome
2008-12-05T16:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	wiehan	if the game needs gnome apps then yes they will be loaded, but they are loaded if you run ANY gnome app if you think about it
2008-12-05T16:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	wiehan	i think you are mixing window manager with desktop environment
2008-12-05T16:02:00.000Z	wiehan	ActionParsnip1	Well, forget about gnome games, take any gnome app for arguments sake
2008-12-05T16:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	wiehan	if you run any DE with a lightweight WM, the desktop itself will be snappier as their is less eye candy
2008-12-05T16:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	wiehan	any app you run from the DE will need the libs to run so will be loaded regardless
2008-12-05T16:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	wiehan	meganox suggestion of running xubuntu uses a lighter desktop environment than gnome but you cna still run metacity on to of it if you want
2008-12-05T16:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	wiehan	i'd install ubuntu then use fluxbox for lightness
2008-12-05T16:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	wiehan	but you will have all the gnome apps you like
2008-12-05T16:05:00.000Z	wiehan	ActionParsnip1	Why fluxbox instead of jwm or xnomad
2008-12-05T16:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	wiehan	i personally use kde + fluxbox
2008-12-05T16:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	wiehan	personal preference, if you prefer those then use them
2008-12-05T16:06:00.000Z	wiehan	ActionParsnip1	So my idea of taking ubuntu and using a lighter WM has some merit to it? Will it be worthwhile on this old laptop?
2008-12-05T16:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	wiehan	absolutely, the desktop will be more responsive due to less graphical fluff
2008-12-05T16:07:00.000Z	wiehan	ActionParsnip1	& meganox: thanks
