2009-01-19T21:32:00.000Z	evowill	kizedek	do you want to install over the network?

2009-01-19T21:33:00.000Z	evowill	kizedek	ouch, what kind of laptop?
2009-01-19T21:39:00.000Z	evowill	kizedek	I think you might be into deeper trouble if you can't see any drives in the bios
2009-01-19T21:40:00.000Z	kizedek	evowill	ya :(
2009-01-19T21:41:00.000Z	evowill	kizedek	this is probably going to require removing the chip to have it re-written, I don't see how booting ubuntu over the network will help you there.
2009-01-19T21:43:00.000Z	kizedek	evowill	 any idea what could cause something like this?
2009-01-19T21:44:00.000Z	evowill	kizedek	If you have tried to flash the bios, could have been a bad flash/bad chip, or it could be something as simple as a hardware failure.
2009-01-19T22:05:00.000Z	kizedek	evowill	Thanks for your help, was afk
2009-01-19T22:05:00.000Z	evowill	kizedek	did it just die at random, or was it a bad flash?
2009-01-19T22:08:00.000Z	kizedek	evowill	it is a relative's PC.  They brought it to me because it would not boot.  It turned out the filesystem was messed up.  I managed to recover it and install all the software along with bios upgrades.  Everything works fine for about 3 weeks.  Now all of a sudden this problem came up
2009-01-19T22:09:00.000Z	evowill	kizedek	you might want to check with the mfg, or it might be cheaper from a company that specializes in that.
2009-01-19T22:11:00.000Z	kizedek	evowill	yup I think thats what will happen
2009-01-19T22:13:00.000Z	evowill	kizedek	Also, if it was paid for with a credit card, you can check with them also, some have protection plans, etc
2009-01-19T22:13:00.000Z	evowill	kizedek	Best of luck
2009-01-19T22:13:00.000Z	kizedek	evowill	thanks again for your advice :)
2009-01-19T22:16:00.000Z	evowill	kizedek	you are welcome
