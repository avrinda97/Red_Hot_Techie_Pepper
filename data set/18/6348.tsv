2008-06-19T22:12:00.000Z	johncoltrane		does anyone know if you can change grub's root option in menu.lst to something other than the root of a partition?
2008-06-19T22:12:00.000Z	Tophat	johncoltrane	- what else did you wanna boot to?
2008-06-19T22:13:00.000Z	johncoltrane	Tophat	I'm trying to boot to the contents of a bootable ISO that I copied to a folder in one of my partitions
2008-06-19T22:14:00.000Z	Tophat	johncoltrane	- you can try and edit your menu.lst to add the location (dont delete the ubuntu from the list) and give it a shot.
2008-06-19T22:16:00.000Z	johncoltrane	Tophat	the contents of the ISO are in a folder in my windows partition, I changed the setting in menu.lst to: rootnoverify (hd0,1)/ISO/ and it boots into windows
2008-06-19T22:21:00.000Z	johncoltrane	Tophat	do you think:   rootnoverify   (hd0,1)/ISO/     is the right syntax
2008-06-19T22:21:00.000Z	Tophat	johncoltrane	- hold on lemme look at some stuffs
2008-06-19T22:29:00.000Z	johncoltrane	Tophat	yup, any ideas?
2008-06-19T22:32:00.000Z	Tophat	johncoltrane	- http://paste.ubuntu.com/21446/
2008-06-19T22:37:00.000Z	johncoltrane	Tophat	Do those instructions work for any ISO or only for a Knoppix live cd?
2008-06-19T22:37:00.000Z	Tophat	johncoltrane	- should be good for any iso. just change knoppix to your iso
2008-06-19T22:40:00.000Z	johncoltrane	Tophat	Thanks I'll try it and le tyou know
2008-06-19T22:46:00.000Z	johncoltrane	Tophat	 So root should be my linux partition and fromhd=/dev should be the folder with the ISO?
2008-06-19T22:59:00.000Z	johncoltrane	Tophat	How do I know if I have the linux26 kernel and minirt26?
2008-06-19T23:01:00.000Z	johncoltrane	Tophat	Probably
2008-06-19T23:02:00.000Z	johncoltrane	Tophat	can I do that with a usb hardrive?
2008-06-19T23:04:00.000Z	johncoltrane	Tophat	how do I burn the ISO to the usb hdd? do I have a blank partition?
2008-06-19T23:21:00.000Z	johncoltrane	Tophat	no luck, it gives me a file not found error
