2008-05-12T03:06:00.000Z	jedimind		im attempting to install ubuntu on an averatec 3200 laptop, when i boot from the CD i get the normal prompt to install etc no problem, i select INSTALL UBUNTU and it loads but then just puts me in a bash prompt, no installation starts .... any ideas?
2008-05-12T03:07:00.000Z	wirechief_intel	jedimind	check your media with md5sum or the test on grub
2008-05-12T03:07:00.000Z	jedimind	wirechief_intel	i did that, i checked the integrity of the cd and it had no problems
2008-05-12T03:07:00.000Z	wirechief_intel	jedimind	ok well it may need a boot cheat noapic
2008-05-12T03:08:00.000Z	jedimind		so select noapic under the options ?
2008-05-12T03:08:00.000Z	wirechief_intel	jedimind	you edit the grub and add it then select b to boot it
2008-05-12T03:09:00.000Z	jedimind		how would i go about doing that ? could you point me to a forum post that explains that ?
2008-05-12T03:09:00.000Z	wirechief_intel		helix yes
2008-05-12T03:09:00.000Z	wirechief_intel		helix use the 32bit .iso less problems
2008-05-12T03:10:00.000Z	wirechief_intel		helix ;)
2008-05-12T03:11:00.000Z	wirechief_intel		helix do you have amd ?
2008-05-12T03:12:00.000Z	wirechief_intel		helix ok well also there is cheat called acpi=force not sure if that will help...you do know how to edit the grub and boot with the modification ?
2008-05-12T03:12:00.000Z	jedimind	wirechief_intel	how would i go about doing that?
2008-05-12T03:13:00.000Z	jedimind		how do i edit grub ? ... what is grub? heh
2008-05-12T03:13:00.000Z	wirechief_intel		helix it only uses the cheat once, it it works fine with cheat then you put it in the menu.lst after you make a backup.
2008-05-12T03:14:00.000Z	wirechief_intel		!grub
2008-05-12T03:14:00.000Z	jedimind		how do i do that if there's no OS on the computer?
2008-05-12T03:15:00.000Z	wirechief_intel	jedimind	see the !grub above for details
