2008-10-02T00:24:00.000Z	fx3	amanulla	what problems are you having?
2008-10-02T00:26:00.000Z	fx3	amanulla	mounting an iso is just like mounting a real harddrive, so: firt you need to make a mount point, just a simple directory, mkdir /media/cdimage
2008-10-02T00:27:00.000Z	fx3	amanulla	then you need to mount that iso onto that directory, mount -o loop image.iso /media/cdimage
2008-10-02T00:27:00.000Z	fx3	amanulla	you say that your image is in desktop, so, cd to desktop, 'cd Desktop' and use the command above
2008-10-02T00:27:00.000Z	fx3	amanulla	are you following ?
2008-10-02T00:28:00.000Z	fx3	amanulla	whats the problem, there is only two commands you need to type
2008-10-02T00:29:00.000Z	fx3	amanulla	pm me if you like, the channel can be a little busy
2008-10-02T00:29:00.000Z	fx3	amanulla	i cannot, i do not know where your image is, and what filename it has
