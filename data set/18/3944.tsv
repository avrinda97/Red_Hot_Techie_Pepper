2009-07-01T19:15:00.000Z	jpbaao_		I am not able to boot a a fresh install of xubuntu on my desktop.  It also won't boot the live install CD
2009-07-01T19:16:00.000Z	soreau	jpbaao_	What are the cpu specs and where does it get stuck at?
2009-07-01T19:17:00.000Z	jpbaao_	soreau	it sticks on "unable to execute '/sbin/getty' for tty1 no such file or directory"
2009-07-01T19:19:00.000Z	jpbaao_	soreau	compaq d220, 1.24 gig ram, 30 and 40 gig HD, NVIDIA GeForce2 MX 400
2009-07-01T19:19:00.000Z	soreau	jpbaao_	What about the cpu?
2009-07-01T19:20:00.000Z	jpbaao_	soreau	sorry, u did ask that... celeron 2.4Ghz
2009-07-01T19:21:00.000Z	soreau	jpbaao_	Then it should be loading..
2009-07-01T19:22:00.000Z	jpbaao_	soreau	live cd just freezes, and tty processes terminate with status 225
2009-07-01T19:23:00.000Z	soreau	jpbaao_	That's no right at all :p
2009-07-01T19:23:00.000Z	jpbaao_	soreau	it isn't helping win my wife away from that other OS
2009-07-01T19:24:00.000Z	soreau	jpbaao_	No doubt.. did you say this is a Jaunty live cd 9.04 and that you already ran the cd check utility?
2009-07-01T19:24:00.000Z	jpbaao_	soreau	tried the live CD on the laptop I'm on now and it works fine.  did run cd check and it checks out
2009-07-01T19:25:00.000Z	jpbaao_	soreau	it is xubuntu Jaunty, but i've tried kub and ub with the sane result...
2009-07-01T19:25:00.000Z	soreau	jpbaao_	You mean s/sabe/same
2009-07-01T19:25:00.000Z	soreau	jpbaao_	You mean s/sane/same
2009-07-01T19:26:00.000Z	jpbaao_	soreau	same
2009-07-01T19:27:00.000Z	soreau	jpbaao_	Not sure what's going on then. Try a different OS for testing maybe? not really sure what's going on. Maybe ask in #linux
2009-07-01T19:27:00.000Z	jpbaao_	soreau	thanks!  i'll give it a shot.
