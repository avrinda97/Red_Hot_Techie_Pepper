2008-05-16T23:04:00.000Z	daftykins		just a full name of writing it
2008-05-16T23:05:00.000Z	daftykins		apt-get is part of the aptitude C++ library
2008-05-16T23:05:00.000Z	daftykins		hey guys if i startup a UML guest the system comes up and starts two consoles, how do i edit it so there's only one?
2008-05-16T23:05:00.000Z	daftykins		there's no /etc/inittab on the system
2008-05-16T23:05:00.000Z	daftykins		some people use the long-hand and i personally use "apt-get blah..."

2008-05-16T23:05:00.000Z	Pici	daftykins	apt-get and aptitude are two different programs
2008-05-28T21:28:00.000Z	Pici	daftykins	It does when Grub doesnt support the filesystem.
2008-05-28T23:41:00.000Z	Pici	daftykins	be nice.
2009-03-05T23:37:00.000Z	Pici	daftykins	When dealing with VNC, that usually means screen 0, not port 0
2011-04-21T23:47:00.000Z	Pici	daftykins	I've seen a few people report issues recently regarding that.
2011-04-21T23:48:00.000Z	daftykins	Pici	interesting, i found a related forum post but all i succeeded in was duplicating the update info :D
2011-04-21T23:49:00.000Z	Pici	daftykins	Check to see whether update-notifier-common is installed.  The scripts in /etc/update-motd.d/ call a bunch of things that should be in that package.
2011-04-21T23:50:00.000Z	daftykins	Pici	yep that package is present
2011-04-21T23:53:00.000Z	Pici	daftykins	And does /etc/update-motd.d/90-updates-available run okay?
2011-04-21T23:55:00.000Z	daftykins	Pici	yep correct output of saying 0 available
2011-04-22T00:11:00.000Z	daftykins	Pici	it's quite funny, now when i SSH in i get two copies, the new saying no updates followed by the old saying there are some :D i tried deleting the contents of /var/run/motd but both come back every time :)
