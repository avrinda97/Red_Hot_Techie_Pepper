2008-04-07T17:47:00.000Z	GIn		why doesn't Ubuntu have ndiwrapper installed by default?
2008-04-07T17:47:00.000Z	ikonia	GIn	why should it
2008-04-07T17:48:00.000Z	GIn	ikonia	that way a lot of users can popin their windows driver and use them in case the wireless card doesn't work out of the box.
2008-04-07T17:48:00.000Z	ikonia	GIn	it's not up to ubuntu to provide windows drives support packages, it's up to you to get it and configure it
2008-04-07T17:49:00.000Z	GIn	ikonia	that attitude must be changed
2008-04-07T17:49:00.000Z	ikonia	GIn	no - people must provide supported drivers to linux
2008-04-07T17:51:00.000Z	GIn	ikonia	but for the time being it won't hurt to have ndiswrapper included
2008-04-12T19:19:00.000Z	ikonia	GIn	so ?
2008-04-12T19:19:00.000Z	GIn	ikonia	I want to use the latest beta version
2008-04-12T19:20:00.000Z	ikonia	GIn	so use it then
2008-04-12T19:20:00.000Z	ikonia	GIn	ubuntu are not going to put every beta version in a stable repo
2008-04-12T19:20:00.000Z	GIn	ikonia	but it is not in the repo
2008-04-12T19:20:00.000Z	GIn	ikonia	firefox 3 should be an exception cause the beta is very stable and much faster than ff 2
2008-04-12T19:21:00.000Z	ikonia	GIn	no it shouldn't be an exception, it's a beta
2008-04-12T19:21:00.000Z	ikonia	GIn	no
2008-05-01T15:19:00.000Z	ikonia	GIn	normally /usr/bin
2008-05-01T15:19:00.000Z	GIn	ikonia	it is not there
2008-05-01T15:20:00.000Z	ikonia	GIn	do you have the php-cli package installed ?
