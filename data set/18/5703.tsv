2010-05-03T12:44:00.000Z	dotblank	esperegu_	I can't really tell you how many nights and days ive spent tinkering with that system

2010-05-03T12:45:00.000Z	dotblank	esperegu_	You must be one brave soul. How functional do you have it/
2010-05-03T12:45:00.000Z	esperegu_	dotblank	not =)
2010-05-03T12:46:00.000Z	dotblank	esperegu_	lol
2010-05-03T12:46:00.000Z	esperegu_	dotblank	my nas is lagging
2010-05-03T12:46:00.000Z	esperegu_	dotblank	dvb not working
2010-05-03T12:47:00.000Z	esperegu_	dotblank	and a lot of other issues
2010-05-03T12:47:00.000Z	dotblank	esperegu_	I got it to work with stored media and pluto and a remote
2010-05-03T12:47:00.000Z	dotblank	esperegu_	with a core server and thin client set up
2010-05-03T12:47:00.000Z	esperegu_	dotblank	well. I have a hybrid and 2 md's and a nas.
2010-05-03T12:48:00.000Z	esperegu_	dotblank	but smb performance seems to be an issue on FreeNAS
2010-05-03T12:48:00.000Z	dotblank	esperegu_	thats thing is so complicated.. I gave up after a month
2010-05-03T12:49:00.000Z	dotblank	esperegu_	I even built linux mce from source
2010-05-03T12:49:00.000Z	esperegu_	dotblank	=). the idea is to make it pnp but now you have to be a geek to use it ;-)
2010-05-03T12:50:00.000Z	dotblank	esperegu_	Its just insaine.. I think it would be much better served if more focus was on pluto and not the entire repo and its hundreds of dependencies.
