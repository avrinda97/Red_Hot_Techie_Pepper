2007-02-19T14:33:00.000Z	SaveFerris_		How do i enable universe from terminal?
2007-02-19T14:34:00.000Z	AlexC_	SaveFerris_	sudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
2007-02-19T14:35:00.000Z	SaveFerris_	AlexC_	"sudo: gedit: command not found"
2007-02-19T14:35:00.000Z	AlexC_	SaveFerris_	do you use KDE?
2007-02-19T14:36:00.000Z	AlexC_	SaveFerris_	oh well if you've not in X then gedit wont work. Instead fo sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
2007-02-19T14:39:00.000Z	SaveFerris_	AlexC_	so what do i do in this /etc/apt/sources.list  ?
2007-02-19T14:40:00.000Z	AlexC_	SaveFerris_	you should see a # next to certain lines like deb http://security ..... deb-src ... remove the # from all of those lines (but not the ones that look like comments in teh code)
2007-02-19T14:45:00.000Z	SaveFerris_	AlexC_	Mk, i took the # from all the lines that had URLS in them then typed "apt-get install nvidia-glx" and now it says "Package nvidia-glx is not available, but is referred to by another package. This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or is only available from another source. E: Package nvidia-glx has no installation candidate"
2007-02-19T14:45:00.000Z	AlexC_	SaveFerris_	sudo apt-get update
2007-02-19T14:46:00.000Z	AlexC_	SaveFerris_	you have to update the package list, with that command - then it should be ok to install
2007-02-19T14:47:00.000Z	SaveFerris_	AlexC_	thats what # apt-get update does... right?
2007-02-19T14:47:00.000Z	AlexC_	SaveFerris_	apt-get update   updates the package list, yeah
2007-02-19T14:47:00.000Z	AlexC_	SaveFerris_	you should run that command every time you add a new repository,
2007-02-19T14:49:00.000Z	SaveFerris_	AlexC_	still getting the same problem after #apt-get update
2007-02-19T14:49:00.000Z	AlexC_	SaveFerris_	why the # ?
2007-02-19T14:50:00.000Z	AlexC_	SaveFerris_	that makes it a comment, which means the command wont get run. you need to type in "sudo apt-get update" no #
2007-02-19T14:50:00.000Z	SaveFerris_	AlexC_	I'm not putting it in there, i thought that just signified a cmd
2007-02-19T14:50:00.000Z	AlexC_	SaveFerris_	ahh, best not to do that :P confuses people as it means a comment in coding/commands
