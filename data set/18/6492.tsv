2008-05-05T15:50:00.000Z	mad_at_wifi	karuna_bdc	format??
2008-05-05T15:51:00.000Z	mad_at_wifi	karuna_bdc	you might want to delete the partition and then recreate it. If that is not possible I cannot think of anything other than a bad HDD. Then again I am not l33t
2008-05-05T15:55:00.000Z	mad_at_wifi	karuna_bdc	did you install ubuntu to a windows partition? As in did you install it ON top of windows?
2008-05-05T15:55:00.000Z	mad_at_wifi	karuna_bdc	drive or partition?
2008-05-05T15:57:00.000Z	mad_at_wifi	karuna_bdc	"it" = "Ubuntu" I presume
2008-05-05T15:59:00.000Z	mad_at_wifi	karuna_bdc	I can understand. Just be a little patient and you will get your answers.
2008-05-05T16:00:00.000Z	mad_at_wifi	karuna_bdc	so you started your system with the LiveCD and tried to install Ubuntu 8.04. It failed ONLY near formatting the HDD right?
2008-05-05T16:03:00.000Z	mad_at_wifi	karuna_bdc	anything else? did you assign a "/" root partition in the partition list?
2008-05-05T16:04:00.000Z	mad_at_wifi	karuna_bdc	what does your partition setup look like?
2008-05-05T16:05:00.000Z	mad_at_wifi	karuna_bdc	Mine : 100GB HDD ========= 11998 MB of "/" ext3 format, 1100MB of "swap", reset as /home in ext3 format
2008-05-05T16:06:00.000Z	mad_at_wifi	karuna_bdc	I see. Could you try the manual route? How big is your HDD?
2008-05-05T16:07:00.000Z	mad_at_wifi	karuna_bdc	try 15GB for "/" ext3 format, 2xRAM size for swap, rest for /home
