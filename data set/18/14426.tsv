2005-08-08T12:22:00.000Z	sproingie	windex	how does grsecurity compare to rsbac?
2005-08-08T12:23:00.000Z	windex	sproingie	i've never used rsbac.
2005-08-08T12:23:00.000Z	sproingie	windex	it was like the original before selinux came around and linus blessed it
2005-08-08T12:23:00.000Z	windex	sproingie	i've been using grsecurity for almost as long as it's existed, so i suppose i'm a little biased. :)
2005-08-08T12:30:00.000Z	sproingie	windex	apt-get moo
2005-08-08T12:30:00.000Z	sproingie	windex	aptitude moo
2005-08-08T12:25:00.000Z	windex	sproingie	selinux and grsecurity have diffrent methods, though. selinux is about containing damage and access during a successful compromise. grsecurity is about both preventing an application exploit from functioning _and_ containing damage after a successful compromise.
2005-08-08T12:29:00.000Z	sproingie	windex	apt is not an application
2005-08-08T12:30:00.000Z	sproingie	windex	apt is the whole system.  aptitude is an app for it
2005-08-08T12:30:00.000Z	sproingie	windex	and aptitude doesn't have super-cow powers, apt-get does
2005-08-08T12:30:00.000Z	windex	sproingie	... super-cow powers.
2005-08-08T12:31:00.000Z	windex	sproingie	someone spent too much time on that.
2005-08-08T12:31:00.000Z	sproingie	windex	aptitude does have minesweeper built in tho
2005-08-08T12:31:00.000Z	windex	sproingie	nevermind. 'moo' is minor compared to including minesweeper.
2005-08-08T12:33:00.000Z	windex	sproingie	even if you remove dpkg you can recover by using a horribly long and tedious process of uncompressing the deb file and going through the setup steps manually.
2005-08-08T12:33:00.000Z	sproingie	windex	yeah but life sucks in the meantime
2005-08-08T12:34:00.000Z	windex	sproingie	one time when 'woody' was telling people to upgrade dpkg, one of my coworkers went, what the hell is that, i don't need that... it wouldn't let him remove it, so he force removed it.. then realized what he'd done. :)
2005-08-08T12:37:00.000Z	windex	sproingie	that makes me feel pain.
