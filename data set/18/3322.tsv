2009-11-04T23:34:00.000Z	logan_	epinky	| It did not autodetect. I ran the command you gave me and it's just a list of my USB ports
2009-11-04T23:34:00.000Z	epinky	logan_	type of device?
2009-11-04T23:35:00.000Z	logan_	epinky	| A microsoft Zune

2009-11-04T23:41:00.000Z	logan_	epinky	| Zune won't work through Rhythmbox or anything other than Zune Software. I just need to find the usb and mount it so I can use it with my virtual machine.
2009-11-04T23:53:00.000Z	epinky	logan_	try disabling EHCI
2009-11-04T23:53:00.000Z	logan_	epinky	| How would I do that?
2009-11-04T23:54:00.000Z	epinky	logan_	BIOS?
2009-11-04T23:54:00.000Z	logan_	epinky	| Oh
2009-11-05T00:05:00.000Z	logan_	epinky	| I still can't get Ubuntu to detect my usb ports. It says they're all empty.
2009-11-05T00:06:00.000Z	logan_	epinky	| Actually, it says it "sees" my ports, but it doesn't detect what's plugged in.
2009-11-05T00:07:00.000Z	epinky	logan_	have you disabled EHCI?
2009-11-05T00:07:00.000Z	logan_	epinky	| yes
2009-11-05T00:11:00.000Z	epinky	logan_	sorry, idk what it could be :(
