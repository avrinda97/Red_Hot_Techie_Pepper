2005-03-16T09:00:00.000Z	underdog		not the only one having this problem, searched through the forums
2005-03-16T09:00:00.000Z	johnnybezak	underdog	what crashes
2005-03-16T09:03:00.000Z	underdog	johnnybezak	the installation crashes
2005-03-16T09:03:00.000Z	johnnybezak	underdog	ok the install on to the laptop
2005-03-16T09:04:00.000Z	johnnybezak	underdog	don't install the extra packages
2005-03-16T09:06:00.000Z	underdog	johnnybezak	i'm running "custom" right now
2005-03-16T09:07:00.000Z	johnnybezak	underdog	good idea, just do a minimal install from the cd, you can always just apt-get the rest of the stuff
2005-03-16T09:13:00.000Z	underdog	johnnybezak	it will still try to install the damn extra packages :(
2005-03-16T09:14:00.000Z	johnnybezak	underdog	that sux
2005-03-16T09:14:00.000Z	johnnybezak	underdog	are you sure its not the dodgy cd
2005-03-16T09:17:00.000Z	underdog	johnnybezak	does the dodgy cd issue happen a lot? I mean, it's brand new... but i'm trying one that was used for an installation already
2005-03-16T09:18:00.000Z	johnnybezak	underdog	it certainly can happen, have you got another copy?
2005-03-16T09:18:00.000Z	underdog	johnnybezak	can we pm?
2005-03-16T09:19:00.000Z	johnnybezak	underdog	yeah
