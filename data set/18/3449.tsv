2010-08-30T14:36:00.000Z	Araneidae		Well almost
2010-08-30T14:37:00.000Z	Araneidae		Firstly you don't need a separate command, you can just do the substitution after the s/splash// one
2010-08-30T14:37:00.000Z	Araneidae		and secondly you mean s/" "/""/
2010-08-30T14:37:00.000Z	Araneidae		yeah, but better: sudo sed -i '/^GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT=/{s/quiet//; s/splash//; s/" *"/""/;}' /etc/default/grub
2010-08-30T14:39:00.000Z	Araneidae		My install was sitting on "fetching file 14 of 14" and had a "Skip" button.  What would that have been about?
2010-08-30T14:39:00.000Z	Araneidae		Why would I want to skip some random fragment of my install?!
2010-08-30T14:40:00.000Z	Araneidae		and another opportunity to skip something random!
2010-08-30T14:40:00.000Z	pfifo	Araneidae	i beleive that has todo with install fonts and language packs
2010-08-30T14:40:00.000Z	Araneidae	pfifo	looks like it this time: says "Downloading language packs..."
2010-08-30T14:42:00.000Z	pfifo	Araneidae	you dont need japanese language support to run ubuntu, so you can skip that stuff
2010-08-30T14:43:00.000Z	Araneidae	pfifo	ah well, too late now.  Maybe I'll uninstall it later if I need the room
2010-08-30T15:09:00.000Z	pfifo	Araneidae	/etc/wget.conf
2010-08-30T15:11:00.000Z	Araneidae	pfifo	does update-manager use wget under the hood?  If so, that's useful to know
2010-08-30T15:11:00.000Z	pfifo	Araneidae	im pretty sure all package managers use wget, and wget has settings for throttling
2010-08-30T15:12:00.000Z	Araneidae	pfifo	I guess you mean /etc/wgetrc
2010-08-30T15:13:00.000Z	pfifo	Araneidae	im not sure if it will work the way its expected, you have little control over how much data others send to you. your recvQ will still fill up
2010-08-30T15:15:00.000Z	pfifo	Araneidae	if you have a routerbox i remember reading an article that used tc and iptables to setup some advanced stuff for managing bandwidth
2010-08-30T15:15:00.000Z	Araneidae	pfifo	yeah, I've heard about that.  I could set up such a box ... but I'm too lazy :(
