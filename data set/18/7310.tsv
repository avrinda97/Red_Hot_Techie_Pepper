2009-11-03T15:52:00.000Z	skar		hi, i'm using jaunty with kde. when i login, dcopserver isn't running and i'm not able to use dcopstart. any ideas?
2009-11-03T15:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	skar	delete the ~/.DCOP blah blah files and reboot
2009-11-03T15:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	skar	if you can't log on, boot to recovery root console and do it there
2009-11-03T15:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	skar	ls -a   will show you the files
2009-11-03T15:54:00.000Z	skar	ActionParsnip	actually i'm able to login. but i'm not able to start konsole with my preconfigured set of tabs using dcopstart. will try deleting DCOP :) thanks :)
2009-11-03T16:00:00.000Z	skar	ActionParsnip	well, i tried what you said, still i'm getting "Error: Could not find service 'konsole-script'." if i run "dcopstart konsole-start"
2009-11-03T16:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	skar	have you websearched that some?
2009-11-03T16:01:00.000Z	skar	ActionParsnip	yup, but not many suggestions or solutions. am still searching :)
2009-11-03T16:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	skar	let me see what i can dig up
2009-11-03T16:01:00.000Z	skar	ActionParsnip	thanks :)
2009-11-03T16:03:00.000Z	skar	ActionParsnip	if i just run "dcop" it gives the list of kde programs running just fine. only dcopstart for konsole-script fails
2009-11-03T16:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	skar	have you put a script in ~/.kde/Autostart  to autorun at login?
2009-11-03T16:05:00.000Z	skar	ActionParsnip	nope. my dcopstart commands are in a script which i run manually.
2009-11-03T16:05:00.000Z	skar	ActionParsnip	this is a plain vanilla install :)
2009-11-03T16:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	skar	hmm, seems there is this: /usr/lib/kde4/share/kde4/services/konsole-script.desktop   which is interesting
2009-11-03T16:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	skar	do you have that file? what does it run?
2009-11-03T16:06:00.000Z	skar	ActionParsnip	hmm i don't have that file. which package provides that file?
2009-11-03T16:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	skar	couldnt tell you dude, try just running: konsole-script   you may find, command-not-found will tell you
