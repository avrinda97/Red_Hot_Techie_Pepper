2007-05-20T12:52:00.000Z	Daverto		I need some help: I am trying to start up the ubuntu 7.04 disc that I ordered, and I reciece the following message: "[  191.728087]  ata2: port failed to respond (30 secs, Status 0xd8)" and "[  192.048007]  ata2.01: revalidation failed (errno=-5)". This happens in BusyBox. Can anyone help me?
2007-05-20T12:53:00.000Z	bbrazil	Daverto	sounds like your had disk controller is having problems
2007-05-20T12:53:00.000Z	bbrazil	Daverto	*hard disk
2007-05-20T12:53:00.000Z	bbrazil	Daverto	try rebooting, both from powered off and powered on
2007-05-20T13:01:00.000Z	Daverto	bbrazil	I looked, and I sill get the error, an error that I get earlier thar that is "/bin/sh: can't access tty; job control turned off" This is still in busy box.
2007-05-20T13:02:00.000Z	bbrazil	Daverto	that error isn't an issue. You likely have faulty hardware
2007-05-20T13:02:00.000Z	Daverto	bbrazil	I have Fedora Core running on the HD.
2007-05-20T13:03:00.000Z	bbrazil	Daverto	does that boot okay?
2007-05-20T13:03:00.000Z	Daverto	bbrazil	yes.
2007-05-20T13:04:00.000Z	bbrazil	Daverto	sounds like either kernel differences, or you don't use this device from fedora
2007-05-20T13:05:00.000Z	Daverto	bbrazil	is there any way I'm going to be able to get ubuntu running with this?
2007-05-20T13:05:00.000Z	bbrazil	Daverto	not with that cd by the looks of it. Have you tried a dapper cd?
2007-05-20T13:06:00.000Z	Daverto	bbrazil	no I havent. Let me download it though, I do not have one on hand,
2007-05-20T13:07:00.000Z	bbrazil	Daverto	if you have a bootable cd from any other distro it might be worth trying
2007-05-20T13:07:00.000Z	Daverto	bbrazil	6.06 is drapper right?
2007-05-20T13:07:00.000Z	bbrazil	Daverto	yip
2007-05-20T13:07:00.000Z	Daverto	bbrazil	I will try it.
2007-05-20T14:52:00.000Z	Daverto	bbrazil	I downloaded dapper and It stops at Mounting Root File System.
