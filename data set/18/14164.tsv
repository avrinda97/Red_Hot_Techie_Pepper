2005-09-08T12:46:00.000Z	arma		madpilot: ok. thanks.
2005-09-08T12:48:00.000Z	arma		ah, one other question. do most hoary users have hoary-backports in their repository list? or do most just use stable?
2005-09-08T12:50:00.000Z	arma		ok. thanks.
2005-09-08T12:51:00.000Z	arma		right. in this case hoary universe ships with a program with some major security problems,
2005-09-08T12:52:00.000Z	arma		and the developers of that program consider it obsolete and aren't maintained that tree anymore (it's 8 months old)
2005-09-08T12:52:00.000Z	ompaul	arma	which program is that?
2005-09-08T12:52:00.000Z	arma		tor
2005-09-08T12:52:00.000Z	arma		(i've been talking to security@ubuntu about it, but i'm trying to get a feel here for what's going on with it)
2005-09-08T12:53:00.000Z	arma		we added a newer version to hoary-backports, but it doesn't sound like this solves the problem of "hoary user apt-gets tor and uses it and is insecure and doesn't know it"
2005-09-08T12:54:00.000Z	arma		i guess i'll see what the security team wants to do.
2005-09-08T12:55:00.000Z	ompaul	arma	one plus is that while it is in universe it is not the kind of thing that is widely used
2005-09-08T12:56:00.000Z	arma		do they remove packages from hoary universe? they seemed hesitant to just remove it.
2005-09-08T12:56:00.000Z	arma		madpilot: right
2005-09-08T12:57:00.000Z	ompaul	arma	well the ccorrect way to do it is to patch the broken version test it and pass out a security alert
2005-09-08T12:57:00.000Z	ompaul		and not in that order :)
2005-09-08T12:58:00.000Z	arma	ompaul	we put out the security alert weeks ago. we've stopped maintaining the 0.0.9.x tree though, since it's 9 months old now.
2005-09-08T12:58:00.000Z	ompaul	arma	ahhh
2005-09-08T12:59:00.000Z	arma	ompaul	we put out a patch for the 0.1.0.x tree, and the 0.1.1.x tree, and told people that 0.0.9.x was now obsolete. so ubuntu is sort of in a bind.
