2009-06-06T05:08:00.000Z	mib_csj1b03z		what encryption do the keys in ubuntu use?
2009-06-06T05:09:00.000Z	tomtommy	mib_csj1b03z	PGP
2009-06-06T05:11:00.000Z	mib_csj1b03z	tomtommy	im guessing PGP is nowhere near AES-256 or AES-128 for that matter?
2009-06-06T05:11:00.000Z	tomtommy	mib_csj1b03z	its 1024 and 2048
2009-06-06T05:12:00.000Z	tomtommy	mib_csj1b03z	using PGP adds billions of years trying to brute force breaking it, compared to AES-256 or AES-128 :)
2009-06-06T05:12:00.000Z	mib_csj1b03z	tomtommy	so it's more secure than AES?
2009-06-06T05:12:00.000Z	tomtommy	mib_csj1b03z	put it this way,,, nobody can break it, ever!  not in billions of years
2009-06-06T05:13:00.000Z	mib_csj1b03z	tomtommy	until someone finds a way that is :P but cool
2009-06-06T05:13:00.000Z	tomtommy	mib_csj1b03z	if you line up 100 of the fastest most powerful computers to brute force a good passworded PGP file, it would take billions of years
2009-06-06T05:14:00.000Z	mib_csj1b03z	tomtommy	lol that's crazy, I always wonder how the actual computer doesnt know what the password is but once u put it in correctly, it knows it's the right password
2009-06-06T05:15:00.000Z	tomtommy	mib_csj1b03z	if you can calculate trillions of passwords per second, it will still take billions of years to find your password
2009-06-06T05:15:00.000Z	mib_csj1b03z	tomtommy	well not if ur password is like abc and they brute-force it :P
2009-06-06T05:16:00.000Z	tomtommy	mib_csj1b03z	my password is 27 charaters in lenght.. contains spaces etc
2009-06-06T05:16:00.000Z	tomtommy	mib_csj1b03z	I remember it in my head
2009-06-06T05:17:00.000Z	mib_csj1b03z	tomtommy	lol is it a sentence like I went to the park today and played soccer lol
2009-06-06T05:18:00.000Z	mib_csj1b03z	tomtommy	how do we know u telling the truth :P
2009-06-06T05:19:00.000Z	tomtommy	mib_csj1b03z	well crack it anyway.. prove to me you can break it as you claim
2009-06-06T05:20:00.000Z	mib_csj1b03z	tomtommy	i cant crack anything but WIndows password with my ophcrack live cd :P, just saying
