2007-12-27T08:23:00.000Z	NewPiracy	infinitycircuit	hardy?
2007-12-27T08:23:00.000Z	infinitycircuit	NewPiracy	Hardy Heron the development release of ubuntu
2007-12-27T08:23:00.000Z	NewPiracy	infinitycircuit	oh, i c ... i hope it will add full support for intel cards
2007-12-27T08:23:00.000Z	infinitycircuit	NewPiracy	unless you have an intel 965 full support is already in gutsy
2007-12-27T08:24:00.000Z	NewPiracy	infinitycircuit	i cant get direct rendering and i believe 3d accel isnt enabled either
2007-12-27T08:24:00.000Z	NewPiracy	infinitycircuit	using driver i810
2007-12-27T08:25:00.000Z	infinitycircuit	NewPiracy	what if you use the i915 driver
2007-12-27T08:25:00.000Z	NewPiracy	infinitycircuit	hmmm, just switch driver name at xorg.conf?
2007-12-27T08:25:00.000Z	infinitycircuit	NewPiracy	use the generic name "intel" in xorg.conf and it should use i915
2007-12-27T08:26:00.000Z	NewPiracy	infinitycircuit	i tried intel before, didn't work
2007-12-27T08:26:00.000Z	infinitycircuit	NewPiracy	ok well i don't know then i only have experience with my 855GM
2007-12-27T08:26:00.000Z	NewPiracy	infinitycircuit	i'm having problems with awn, that's why i would like to enable direct rendering
2007-12-27T08:28:00.000Z	NewPiracy	infinitycircuit	is there a way to explicitly invoke direct rendering in xorg.conf?
2007-12-27T08:29:00.000Z	infinitycircuit	NewPiracy	add "dri" in the modules section and Option "DRI" "true" in the devices section
