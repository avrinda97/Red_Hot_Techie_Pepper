2005-08-31T06:03:00.000Z	tristanmike		I was looking at "linux laptops" like laptops sold with linux and they were like 4 grand US, I couldn't believe it
2005-08-31T06:04:00.000Z	cafuego	tristanmike	I believe Ubuntu has a laptop program with HP laptops. Find out which model and check the HP site :-)
2005-08-31T06:04:00.000Z	tristanmike	cafuego	will do
2005-08-31T06:04:00.000Z	cafuego	tristanmike	(Mine's an nx9005, which runs Ubuntu just dandy  -it IS about 3 years old, though)
2005-08-31T06:14:00.000Z	cafuego	tristanmike	You don't like the Linux tax?
2005-08-31T06:14:00.000Z	tristanmike	cafuego	i guess it's only fair, since i don't pay for the software :)
2005-09-25T11:53:00.000Z	tristanmike	cafuego	no such file or directory
2005-09-25T11:54:00.000Z	tristanmike	cafuego	I don't have it, and I'm running Hoary
2005-09-25T11:54:00.000Z	tristanmike	cafuego	wait, I take that back
2005-09-25T11:54:00.000Z	tristanmike	cafuego	sorry, I do have it after all
2005-09-25T11:55:00.000Z	tristanmike	cafuego	nah, there, I just had them sorted differently
2005-09-25T11:55:00.000Z	tristanmike	cafuego	but !find apt-setup doesn't work for me
2005-09-25T11:56:00.000Z	tristanmike	cafuego	I believe so
2005-09-25T11:57:00.000Z	tristanmike	cafuego	ha, but no, "event not found"
2005-09-25T11:59:00.000Z	tristanmike	cafuego	sure, I'm in root too
2005-09-25T12:00:00.000Z	tristanmike	cafuego	oh, I thought you were talking about something else
2005-09-25T12:00:00.000Z	tristanmike	cafuego	I got lost there
2005-09-25T12:01:00.000Z	tristanmike	cafuego	that hints very much at bed time very shortly
