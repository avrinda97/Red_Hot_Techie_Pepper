2007-04-21T10:20:00.000Z	Stoffer		In scheduling a task to kill Azureus w/ the gnome-scheduler, what would the command be?  Kill azurues wouldn't work, would it?
2007-04-21T10:20:00.000Z	Stoffer		oh right
2007-04-21T10:21:00.000Z	Stoffer		and any idea why gnome-scheduler keeps saying that I don't have a crontab (besides that I probably don't have a crontab), and/or how to fix it?
2007-04-21T10:21:00.000Z	levander	Stoffer	'pidof azureus' or 'pgrep azureus' would give the pid
2007-04-21T10:22:00.000Z	Stoffer	levander	yeah, but it changes each time I start it right?  Not useful for a recurring task
2007-04-21T10:22:00.000Z	levander	Stoffer	so, make this your command to kill it: kill `pgrep azureus`
2007-04-21T10:22:00.000Z	levander	Stoffer	check "pgrep azureus" on the command line to make sure it works
2007-04-21T10:23:00.000Z	Stoffer	levander	good idea...would that work better than killall azureus?
2007-04-21T10:24:00.000Z	Stoffer	levander	"pgrep azureus" does not output anything
2007-04-21T10:25:00.000Z	levander	Stoffer	I'm not sure of the differences between running your killall and the command I suggested, generally they both do the same thing.  Just play on the command line and check a few man pages...
2007-04-21T10:25:00.000Z	Stoffer	levander	it must be named something else
2007-04-21T10:25:00.000Z	levander	Stoffer	what's named something else?
2007-04-21T10:25:00.000Z	Stoffer	levander	azureus.  pgrep azurues gives me nothing, and I can't find it in ps -A
2007-04-21T10:26:00.000Z	levander	Stoffer	you're sure it's running?
2007-04-21T10:26:00.000Z	Stoffer	levander	yeah...I'm looking right at it
2007-04-21T10:26:00.000Z	Stoffer	levander	though it's not doing anything...
2007-04-21T10:26:00.000Z	Stoffer	levander	it's been giving me problems all night
2007-04-21T10:31:00.000Z	Stoffer	levander	azureus runs under the process name gij-4.1 ... go figure...
