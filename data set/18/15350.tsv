2005-04-07T12:26:00.000Z	crimsun	HiPn0t|zE	that's not helping, either
2005-04-07T12:28:00.000Z	crimsun	HiPn0t|zE	yes, through the standard usbnet drivers that are included in the kernel
2005-04-07T12:29:00.000Z	HiPn0t|zE	crimsun	is there a list of some sort so i can check for my modem ?
2005-04-07T12:29:00.000Z	crimsun	HiPn0t|zE	the usbnet driver is generic and supports all usb modems that follow its standard.
2005-04-07T12:30:00.000Z	HiPn0t|zE	crimsun	: i have a dlink 200 usb modem , would that work
2005-04-07T12:30:00.000Z	crimsun	HiPn0t|zE	it should (I can't vouch for that model specifically)
2005-04-07T12:30:00.000Z	HiPn0t|zE	crimsun	: well i run pppoa
2005-04-07T12:35:00.000Z	crimsun	HiPn0t|zE	remember the CoC, please, even for people who are disrespectful.
2005-04-07T13:35:00.000Z	crimsun	HiPn0t|zE	several Ubuntu developers live in .au :)
