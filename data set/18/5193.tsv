2009-07-04T01:22:00.000Z	guntbert	mickster04	I beg your pardon?
2009-07-04T01:22:00.000Z	mickster04	guntbert	what ubottu said
2009-07-04T01:23:00.000Z	guntbert	mickster04	?? why would I need that?
2009-07-04T01:23:00.000Z	mickster04	guntbert	you asked about iso's?
2009-07-04T01:24:00.000Z	guntbert	mickster04	I didn't, I' trying to find a solution for unjustice
2009-07-04T01:24:00.000Z	mickster04	guntbert	0h sorry my mistake
2009-07-04T01:24:00.000Z	guntbert	mickster04	np :)
2010-05-05T00:36:00.000Z	guntbert	mickster04	don't recommend sudo su please!!
2010-05-05T00:36:00.000Z	mickster04	guntbert	oh didn't know sorry
2010-05-05T00:36:00.000Z	guntbert	mickster04	if you *really* need a root shell use sudo -i
2010-05-05T00:37:00.000Z	mickster04	guntbert	well if sudo mkdir doesn't work, surely sudo (s/su/-i) would work?
2010-05-05T00:38:00.000Z	guntbert	mickster04	probably not - you get the same permission with sudo as with su - only the environment is safer
2010-05-11T01:36:00.000Z	mickster04	guntbert	why say that to me?
2010-05-11T01:37:00.000Z	guntbert	mickster04	because you asked : its easier to move the buttons than the scroll bar?
2010-05-11T01:37:00.000Z	mickster04	guntbert	if u bothered to pay attention
2010-05-11T01:38:00.000Z	guntbert	mickster04	sorry then - I saw that as question  - with a ? at the end :-)
