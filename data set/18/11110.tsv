2007-07-19T07:40:00.000Z	ShackJack	revilodraw	Maybe check out Exaile - it's pretty cool and has most of Amarok;'s features - plus made for GNOME not KDE
2007-07-19T07:45:00.000Z	ShackJack	revilodraw	Well, I don't think Amarok is particualry pretty, but I hear what your saying... they have a great SVN version you can use with more features...

2007-07-28T15:47:00.000Z	ShackJack	revilodraw	Are you running network manager on startup?
2007-07-28T15:48:00.000Z	ShackJack	revilodraw	Preferences -> Sessions -> Startup programs although you should see something in system tray...
2007-07-28T15:49:00.000Z	ShackJack	revilodraw	When you startup you should be able to click the network mgr icon in tray and select network...
2007-07-28T15:51:00.000Z	ShackJack	revilodraw	No, it shouldn't but it should pop up networks - it doesn't show you wired/wireless networks?
2007-07-28T15:51:00.000Z	ShackJack	revilodraw	And you shold also have an option for manual configuration... DO you not have that?
2007-07-28T15:52:00.000Z	ShackJack	revilodraw	When you startup the first time what does it show?
2007-07-28T15:54:00.000Z	ShackJack	revilodraw	No, I'm sure you can decribe to me what network mgr tray applet shows upon first startup... If it shows your network you shold be able to select...
2007-07-28T15:56:00.000Z	ShackJack	revilodraw	Upon first startup? Great then you can just pick wireless, no?
2007-07-28T16:00:00.000Z	ShackJack	revilodraw	Perhaps enable roaming mode if it isn't already? I'm a little stumped, sorry...
2007-07-29T16:02:00.000Z	ShackJack	revilodraw	Admin -> Network... select wireless and check it... may already be enabled though...
2007-07-29T05:06:00.000Z	ShackJack	revilodraw	Asked for password for what?
2007-07-29T08:02:00.000Z	ShackJack	revilodraw	Which media player?
2007-07-29T08:06:00.000Z	ShackJack	revilodraw	I'm not positive, but I don't think version in repos supports that... but you have to get the svn version (they have a repo for fesisty) -- check out exaile.org or #exaile for deets... I'm using SVN with my wma files (though it reports the bit rate wrong)...
