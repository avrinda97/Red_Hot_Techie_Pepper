2008-05-07T13:38:00.000Z	casdf		so i'm trying to get ubuntu to dualboot nicely under vista, but i didn't install grub. what should i do now?
2008-05-07T13:40:00.000Z	casdf		can i not boot ubuntu under the vista bootloader?
2008-05-07T13:40:00.000Z	adam7	casdf	you can, but it probably is easier to install grub
2008-05-07T13:40:00.000Z	casdf	adam7	the reason i ask is because i have a recovery partition from lenovo, which im not sure grub will play nicely with
2008-05-07T13:40:00.000Z	adam7	casdf	try this http://www.neowin.net/forum/index.php?showtopic=473915&pid=587684376&st=0&#entry587684376
2008-05-07T13:41:00.000Z	casdf	adam7	ok, thanks im gonna check it out
2008-05-07T13:41:00.000Z	adam7	casdf	looking at it now, it might not be too helpful :P
2008-05-07T13:41:00.000Z	casdf	adam7	heh, yeah it seems to be for using grub
2008-05-07T13:42:00.000Z	adam7	casdf	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=265325 might be better
2008-05-07T13:43:00.000Z	casdf	adam7	so i install grub onto the linux partition then?
2008-05-07T13:43:00.000Z	casdf	adam7	even if ubuntu has already been installed?
2008-05-07T13:43:00.000Z	adam7	casdf	you'll probably need to I think - every time there is a kernel update, the loading stuff changes, which is why grub is easier
2008-05-07T13:44:00.000Z	adam7	casdf	you can install GRUB to the Ubuntu partition, and then load GRUB from the Windows bootloader
2008-05-07T13:44:00.000Z	casdf	adam7	ok, that sounds like an awesome plan.
2008-05-07T13:44:00.000Z	adam7	casdf	it doesn't involve messing with your MBR at all
2008-05-07T13:45:00.000Z	casdf	adam7	and i do this by livecd'ing ubuntu?
2008-05-07T13:45:00.000Z	adam7	casdf	I think that's how it works -- I'm not too on top of this bootloader stuff so I can't give you directions
2008-05-07T13:46:00.000Z	adam7	casdf	with the clever use of dd you should be able to copy that partition and make a dvd out of it
