2008-06-25T18:41:00.000Z	tomaspg		im trying to replace my xorg.conf file, but it wont let me paste the new file or rename the old one?
2008-06-25T18:41:00.000Z	gabbler	tomaspg	are you doing it as sudo?
2008-06-25T18:43:00.000Z	gabbler	tomaspg	sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf ...
2008-06-25T18:57:00.000Z	gabbler	tomaspg	sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf /to where you want it copied
2008-06-25T18:58:00.000Z	tomaspg	gabbler	im trying to replace the current xorg.conf file, which needs to be in /etc/x11/ ? as far as i understood atleast..
2008-06-25T18:59:00.000Z	gabbler	tomaspg	where is you current xorg.conf ?
2008-06-25T18:59:00.000Z	gabbler	tomaspg	/ or your home, ie ~/ or /home/tomas
2008-06-25T19:00:00.000Z	tomaspg	gabbler	 in /
2008-06-25T19:01:00.000Z	gabbler	tomaspg	sudo cp /xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2008-06-25T19:02:00.000Z	tomaspg	gabbler	 cannot create regular file, no such file or directory...who new that copying a file could be this painful :)
2008-06-25T19:03:00.000Z	gabbler	tomaspg	a question is if it is not there why do you need it, but anyway....
2008-06-25T19:03:00.000Z	gabbler	tomaspg	sudo touch /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2008-06-25T19:03:00.000Z	tomaspg	gabbler	 i need to change it to get my resolution fixed
2008-06-25T19:05:00.000Z	tomaspg	gabbler	 says the file isnt there or the directory, but i can see it in the file browser
2008-06-25T19:06:00.000Z	gabbler	tomaspg	do a ls -l , is it shown?
2008-06-25T19:07:00.000Z	tomaspg	gabbler	 where do you want me to put the ls-l in ? when i did it in the terminal it came up as command not found
2008-06-25T19:08:00.000Z	gabbler	tomaspg	ls -l /etc/X11
2008-06-25T19:09:00.000Z	tomaspg	gabbler	 doh... when i tried to do the cp command i typed the x11 with a lowercase.. think its all good now :P thanks
