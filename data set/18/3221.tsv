2011-08-20T00:03:00.000Z	delkin		Hi everyone. I have installed the package 'playdeb', but when I click the 'install this now', in order to install a game, my system doesnt know which application should open to install it... I also have no idea where to find the 'playdeb' application (path). Someone help?    http://www.playdeb.net/updates/Ubuntu/all#how_to_install
2011-08-20T00:04:00.000Z	usr13	delkin	What version of Ubuntu do you have installed?
2011-08-20T00:05:00.000Z	delkin	usr13	I have ubuntu 11.04
2011-08-20T00:06:00.000Z	usr13	delkin	Did you add the software soruce ?
2011-08-20T00:07:00.000Z	usr13	delkin	YOu got it installed?  Yes?  Or are you still trying to install it?
2011-08-20T00:07:00.000Z	delkin	usr13	I just installed the package 'playdeb'
2011-08-20T00:08:00.000Z	usr13	delkin	which playdeb   #What does that say?
2011-08-20T00:08:00.000Z	delkin	usr13	my synaptic manager has the package 'playdeb' installed. I downloaded it from the website.
2011-08-20T00:09:00.000Z	usr13	delkin	You did not install it via the package manager?
2011-08-20T00:09:00.000Z	delkin	usr13	No, i didn't. The package says this:
2011-08-20T00:09:00.000Z	delkin		This package adds the playdeb repository entry to your source list
2011-08-20T00:09:00.000Z	delkin		and adds the respective GPG key.
2011-08-20T00:10:00.000Z	usr13	delkin	see my pm
2011-08-20T00:11:00.000Z	usr13	delkin	I think so far, you've only added the source
2011-08-20T00:11:00.000Z	delkin	usr13	i think you might be right. What should I do?
2011-08-20T00:12:00.000Z	usr13	delkin	Oh, you probably need to do sudo apt-get update   first
2011-08-20T00:12:00.000Z	usr13	delkin	sudo apt-get update
2011-08-20T00:13:00.000Z	usr13	delkin	And then, click on one of them.
