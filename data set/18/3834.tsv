2012-07-17T15:12:00.000Z	Hfuy		Hello.
2012-07-17T15:12:00.000Z	Hfuy		I'm looking for an OS to replace Win7 on my Lenovo Ideapad S12 (the Ion version).
2012-07-17T15:12:00.000Z	Hfuy		Ubuntu has been suggested, but I'm not sure what the best way is to check compatibility.
2012-07-17T15:13:00.000Z	xrdodrx	Hfuy	boot an ubuntu live disk and see if everything works
2012-07-17T15:13:00.000Z	Hfuy		There is some information about the S12 on help.ubuntu.com, but it's a couple of years out of date. Can anyone suggest anywhere to look?
2012-07-17T15:13:00.000Z	Hfuy		Tricky - no DVD-ROM drive on these.
2012-07-17T15:13:00.000Z	xrdodrx		a live usb is possible too
2012-07-17T15:14:00.000Z	Hfuy	ikonia	Ehhh. That sounds like something I'd rather give a miss.
2012-07-17T15:14:00.000Z	Hfuy		Well possibly I can, but does anyone know how
2012-07-17T15:14:00.000Z	Hfuy		how "u can run it from usb"
2012-07-17T15:15:00.000Z	Hfuy		The only reason I'm looking at this is that I don't do very heavy work on the laptop, and it's pig slow running Win7.
2012-07-17T15:15:00.000Z	Hfuy		I'm not aware there's any particular reason Ubuntu would be faster, but I thought it was worth a try.
2012-07-17T15:17:00.000Z	Hfuy		I have.

2012-07-17T15:17:00.000Z	Hfuy		What are the chances that doing this USB boot thing will damage any information that's already on the laptop's SSD?
2012-07-17T15:18:00.000Z	Hfuy		I'm just a little concerned that obviously the NTFS filesystem driver has been reverse-engineered and I seem to recall at some point there were some reliability concerns.
2012-07-17T15:18:00.000Z	xrdodrx		a non-ubuntu URL? pretty sure that's not anywhere close to against the rules psilo23
2012-07-17T15:19:00.000Z	xrdodrx	Hfuy	if you're just booting from the disk your SSD will never be touched unless you mount it
