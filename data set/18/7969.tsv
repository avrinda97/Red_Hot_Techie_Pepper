2008-02-27T00:44:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix		yup
2008-02-27T00:46:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix		I'm not on my machine... tools, options, then maybe view....
2008-02-27T00:47:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	ArthurArchnix	Are you using metacity or emerald?
2008-02-27T00:47:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	ArthurArchnix	Sorry. Wrong guy...
2008-03-08T03:10:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	ArthurArchnix	Where does it get the color if you use "x" ?
2008-03-08T03:10:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	ArthurArchnix	Or does it make it transparent ?
2008-03-08T03:11:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	Odd-rationale	right now I don't even see a colour. I've set my login to be plain, no colour with an image. My desktop is the same image.
2008-03-08T03:12:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	ArthurArchnix	That is good to know. Thanks for the hint. Hopefully this will be fixed in hardy, feisty never had this probelm...
2008-03-08T03:12:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	Odd-rationale	Yeah.. it was a silly regression. But they had all kinds of problems with gdm in gutsy. Remember the epic "GDM is taking too long to load desktop thread"? I think it's at like 2000 posts right now or something... :)
2008-03-08T03:13:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	ArthurArchnix	So you have BACKCOLOR="x" or with out "" ?
2008-03-08T03:13:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	ArthurArchnix	No quotes?
2008-03-08T03:13:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	Odd-rationale	 Which doesn't make sense. I know... if 'x' then 'x'...
2008-03-08T03:14:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	ArthurArchnix	Ok.
2008-03-08T03:14:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	ArthurArchnix	What is wrong?
2008-03-08T03:15:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	Odd-rationale	"#x" should be "x"
2008-03-08T03:15:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	ArthurArchnix	No quotes? single quotes?
2008-03-13T17:06:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	Odd-rationale	I thought noboxy talks in xubuntu
2008-03-13T17:06:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	ArthurArchnix	:(
