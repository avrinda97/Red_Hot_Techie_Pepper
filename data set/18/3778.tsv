2009-08-05T02:30:00.000Z	AE^laptop		sudo apt-get purge pulseaudio
2009-08-05T02:30:00.000Z	Kalisto_	AE^laptop	thats the last option
2009-08-05T02:31:00.000Z	Kalisto_	AE^laptop	i agree
2009-08-05T02:38:00.000Z	Kalisto_	AE^laptop	what does it say when you try and run it?
2009-08-05T02:39:00.000Z	AE^laptop	Kalisto_	"alsamixer: function snd_ctl_open failed for default: No such file or directory"
2009-08-05T02:40:00.000Z	Kalisto_	AE^laptop	reinstall alsa-utils
2009-08-05T02:40:00.000Z	Kalisto_	AE^laptop	basically try reinstalling all of alsa. dont need to remove first
2009-08-05T02:42:00.000Z	Kalisto_	AE^laptop	then remove first. i forget how to re-install in console
2009-08-05T02:43:00.000Z	Kalisto_	AE^laptop	sec
2009-08-05T02:44:00.000Z	AE^laptop	Kalisto_	(i've got no internet on that machine atm, so have to take it to work to get an internet connection, which kinda sucks, since i cant play with it when i really got time)
2009-08-05T02:44:00.000Z	Kalisto_	AE^laptop	just use Synaptic packet manager. search for alsa and all installed apps just mark for reinstallation
2009-08-05T02:46:00.000Z	Kalisto_	AE^laptop	ok then just do it with apt and reinstall all alsa
2009-08-05T02:46:00.000Z	Kalisto_	AE^laptop	not having internet for your box sucks ;) why dont you hook it up?
2009-08-05T02:48:00.000Z	AE^laptop	Kalisto_	tell me about it... i cant tho, i only have mobile broadband here, and it isnt supported on that box, no gui and all... plus i dunno how to fix it in kde either
2009-08-05T02:49:00.000Z	Kalisto_	AE^laptop	id go with gnome. i think its way way nicer. i used to use kde until i tried gnome.
2009-08-05T02:51:00.000Z	Kalisto_	AE^laptop	beta to ubuntu but not the rest of the linux world :D
2009-08-05T02:52:00.000Z	Kalisto_	AE^laptop	yea should be easy.
2009-08-05T02:53:00.000Z	Kalisto_	AE^laptop	yea with internet you would have fixed it in 2 min.
