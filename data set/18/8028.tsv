2008-04-03T23:35:00.000Z	Scunizi	Odd-rationale	yes.. sorry couldn't remember the name.
2008-04-03T23:36:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	Scunizi	It seems like that is the only one... Does it work well with rhythmbox or amarok?
2008-04-03T23:37:00.000Z	Scunizi	Odd-rationale	not really sure.. but others have had success.
2008-04-03T23:38:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	Scunizi	ok thanks!
2008-04-14T05:43:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	Scunizi	I beleive it has been renamed to openGEU
2008-04-14T05:44:00.000Z	Scunizi	Odd-rationale	ah.. ok.. didn't know that.. mark[oz] did you catch that?
2008-07-24T00:02:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	Scunizi	sudo apt-get clean
2008-07-26T21:06:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	Scunizi	think of it as the swap partiton is inside the exteneded partition.
2008-07-26T21:09:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	Scunizi	well. i believe the reason is that you can only have a maximum of 4 partitions on the drive. An extended (or logical partition) is not a "real" partition itself. It can contain partitions inside it. You can put as many partitons as you want inside an extended partiton.
2008-07-26T21:11:00.000Z	Scunizi	Odd-rationale	that's true.  My thought is though, for an default install that would typically be used by an uninformed user they wouldn't know anything about partitions and therefore have no future use for an extended partition.. by creating one doesn't it just eat a little extra HD space just in the creation?
2008-07-26T21:12:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	Scunizi	i don't think is uses extra space. But you never know if a user ever decides to add more partitions or something...
2008-07-26T21:13:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	Scunizi	i always put my swap and /home partition in the extended partition...
2008-07-26T21:15:00.000Z	Scunizi	Odd-rationale	and thus the nick :) .. to me that's an odd rationale. :)
2008-07-26T21:16:00.000Z	Scunizi	Odd-rationale	I put /home on it's own drive and swap where ever, but typically in it's own primary partition.
2008-07-26T21:18:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	Scunizi	heh. my nick is my anagram, actually... ;)
