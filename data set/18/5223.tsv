2009-03-12T20:46:00.000Z	Trevkor		I'd love it if someone could give me some advice/insight on a problem I'm having. I'm currently running Ubuntu 8.10 in VMware, where the base is Windows XP x64.   Well, when I attempt to download anything, including updates, the download starts strong, at about 500 KB/s. After a few seconds, it drops down to about 5-200 B/s.  I've tried it on several similar base machines, and made several VMs of different Ubuntu releases, and I have the same problem. I ru

2009-03-12T20:48:00.000Z	Trevkor		Does anyone have any insight to the issue I seem to be running into, or no? I'd appreciate any thoughts on the matter.
2009-03-12T20:50:00.000Z	nado	Trevkor	if you're download drops in the VM is it still high on Windows ?
2009-03-12T20:50:00.000Z	Trevkor	nado	Yes, I am. None of the other VMs (or the base machine) I've tried have had the problem. And I've run it from a Live CD, and haven't had the problem.

2009-03-12T20:51:00.000Z	Trevkor	nado	 I keep my download speed at around 500 KB/s in everything BUT the Ubuntu VM. The base machine. XP VM, Vista VM, and my Fedora VM.
2009-03-12T20:51:00.000Z	nado	Trevkor	try to start a download in Windows when the rate drops in the VM. If it's still low on Windows it might not come from the VM or Ubuntu
2009-03-12T20:51:00.000Z	nado	Trevkor	ok
2009-03-12T20:52:00.000Z	Trevkor	nado	I've tried that, and it's high on the Windows side of things, but the Ubuntu side stays low.
2009-03-12T20:52:00.000Z	nado	Trevkor	it could either come from the VM configuration, or the Ubuntu configuration
2009-03-12T20:52:00.000Z	nado	Trevkor	I would try to play around with the VM options, because Ubuntu in a vm is usually pretty standard.
2009-03-12T20:53:00.000Z	nado	Trevkor	maybe try to change the way you are sharing your network interface
2009-03-12T20:53:00.000Z	nado	Trevkor	these are just ideas.. It's hard to tell what your problem could be
2009-03-12T20:53:00.000Z	Trevkor	nado	I had assumed that I had most likely mis-configured something, though I've no what it is. I've tried adjusting both VM settings and Ubuntu settings, especially the ones concerning connectivity to a network, and it doesn't seem to change anything.
2009-03-12T20:54:00.000Z	Trevkor	nado	I appreciate the help you've given, so thanks. I simply got so frustrated with it that I had to ask someone for help. It took over 2 hours to download a few small updates the other day.
2009-03-12T20:54:00.000Z	nado	Trevkor	are you using NAT or Bridged to share the network interface ? or have you tried both ?
2009-03-12T20:54:00.000Z	Trevkor	nado	I've tried both.
