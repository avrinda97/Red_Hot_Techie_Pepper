2006-10-31T13:29:00.000Z	morgue		guys, firefox 2.0 is crashing when I try to open http://www.cnn.com/2006/AUTOS/carreviews/03/01/cr_reliability/index.html do you have any suggestions?
2006-10-31T13:29:00.000Z	Ratzilla	morgue	what kind of error do you get? segmentation fault?
2006-10-31T13:36:00.000Z	Ratzilla	morgue	go into terminal, open firefox and go to that link. and then see what exit message is inputed to the terminal
2006-10-31T13:38:00.000Z	Ratzilla	morgue	open firefox and go to the link
2006-10-31T13:38:00.000Z	Ratzilla	morgue	and when firefox just closes, there will be an error message in the terminal
2006-10-31T13:38:00.000Z	morgue	Ratzilla	I did, firefox closes but I don't see anything on the console
2006-10-31T13:39:00.000Z	morgue	Ratzilla	do i have to open firefox from the terminal?
2006-10-31T13:39:00.000Z	Ratzilla	morgue	yes
2006-10-31T13:39:00.000Z	morgue	Ratzilla	ok sorry then, how do i do that? :)
2006-10-31T13:39:00.000Z	Ratzilla	morgue	type firefox in the terminal
2006-10-31T13:46:00.000Z	morgue	Ratzilla	firefox was crashing even before that, I don't think that had to do with it
2006-10-31T13:43:00.000Z	Ratzilla	morgue	did you upgrade distro or anythign recently?
2006-10-31T13:44:00.000Z	morgue	Ratzilla	yeah, last night upgraded from 6.06 to 6.10
2006-10-31T13:44:00.000Z	morgue	Ratzilla	but it was crasing even before that
2006-10-31T13:44:00.000Z	Ratzilla	morgue	via apt-get or aptitude?
2006-10-31T13:45:00.000Z	morgue	Ratzilla	 I used gksu "update-manager -c"
2006-10-31T13:46:00.000Z	Ratzilla	morgue	updating distro versions usually gives unstability..i'd recommend a clean install of edgy...
2006-10-31T14:00:00.000Z	Ratzilla	morgue	no / at the beginning
