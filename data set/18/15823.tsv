2005-06-20T11:52:00.000Z	makaveli0129		i have a question: what kernel does the ubuntu cd use? For instance i want to set root as root=/dev/hdc2 in the boot parameter but what kernel would i put before that?
2005-06-20T11:53:00.000Z	makaveli0129		?
2005-06-20T11:53:00.000Z	HappyFool	makaveli0129	wouldn't it be easier to edit grub's /boot/grub/menu.lst ?
2005-06-20T11:54:00.000Z	HappyFool	makaveli0129	oh, i see
2005-06-20T11:54:00.000Z	HappyFool	makaveli0129	no, sorry
2005-06-20T11:54:00.000Z	HappyFool	makaveli0129	what are you trying to do ?
2005-06-20T11:55:00.000Z	HappyFool	makaveli0129	can't you perhaps use chroot ?
2005-06-20T11:56:00.000Z	HappyFool	makaveli0129	well, first you need to get to a command prompt after booting off the CD
2005-06-20T11:56:00.000Z	HappyFool	makaveli0129	i guess you can just use the live cd, that should work
2005-06-20T11:57:00.000Z	HappyFool	makaveli0129	so you don't have any ubuntu cd's ?
2005-06-20T11:59:00.000Z	HappyFool	makaveli0129	i'm not sure. have you tried booting it, getting to the first install screen and then pressing Alt-F2 ? Or checking if there's a 'rescue' mode?
2005-06-20T12:00:00.000Z	HappyFool	makaveli0129	just a moment
2005-06-20T12:00:00.000Z	HappyFool	makaveli0129	ah-ha!
2005-06-20T12:00:00.000Z	HappyFool	makaveli0129	according to this page: http://www.ubuntulinux.org/support/ReleaseNotes504/document_view   -- there's a rescue mode in the install process
2005-06-20T12:02:00.000Z	HappyFool	makaveli0129	when you boot the install CD, can you see a 'rescue' option of any sort
2005-06-20T12:03:00.000Z	HappyFool	makaveli0129	doh
2005-06-20T12:03:00.000Z	HappyFool	makaveli0129	ok, let's try the Alt-F2 thing then
2005-06-20T12:07:00.000Z	HappyFool	makaveli0129	you getting anywhere?
