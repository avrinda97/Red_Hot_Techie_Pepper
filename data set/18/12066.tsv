2007-07-31T06:11:00.000Z	Jason_	m_	I've got an HP laptop that won't boot. It displays Buffer I/O error sr0 358120 (usb legacy off - using no apic nolapic)
2007-07-31T06:11:00.000Z	m_	Jason_	do u know how to change boot derection?
2007-07-31T06:12:00.000Z	Jason_	m_	no. Not too linux experienced.
2007-07-31T06:13:00.000Z	m_	Jason_	ok... i think you have to press F8 or something just when u turn on ur computer. if u look hardly you wil see a message: Press (...) to enter setup
2007-07-31T06:14:00.000Z	Jason_	m_	for the BIOS menu? I misunderstood you. I can do that.
2007-07-31T06:14:00.000Z	m_		ok
2007-07-31T06:15:00.000Z	m_	Jason_	in the BIOS menu, change to CD (if u trying to boot from CD)
2007-07-31T06:16:00.000Z	Jason_	m_	OK, got that far. The live CD won't boot, though.
2007-07-31T06:16:00.000Z	Jason_		It gets to the splash screen OK, but dies before starting X
2007-07-31T06:17:00.000Z	m_	Jason_	 ok... have u changed the boot settings so u don't boot from an USB or something?
2007-07-31T06:17:00.000Z	Jason_	m_	The settings are 1.)CD-ROM 2.)HDD 3.) Floppy 4.) Removable devices.
2007-07-31T06:18:00.000Z	m_	Jason_	now i think i know what your problem is: try to download a new ubuntu image
2007-07-31T06:18:00.000Z	Jason_	m_	I've tried that a few times also. It also passes the verification check
2007-07-31T06:19:00.000Z	m_	Jason_	ok.. then i can't help u...stty
2007-07-31T06:19:00.000Z	Jason_	m_	for what it's worth Fedora and Mandriva won't boot either.
