2005-04-29T14:48:00.000Z	hobocop		ok another quickie, I am sharing folders on my network, both comps are running ubuntu, and for some reason (when running a samba server) even if I dont check read only, I just get errors when trying to move the files between computers
2005-04-29T14:49:00.000Z	klaas	hobocop	What kind of errors?
2005-04-29T14:50:00.000Z	hobocop		first it tells me that the file already exists
2005-04-29T14:50:00.000Z	hobocop		which is doesnt
2005-04-29T14:50:00.000Z	hobocop		The folder "smb://laposin/...t%20(copy).iso" already exists.  Would you like to replace it?
2005-04-29T14:50:00.000Z	hobocop		then I say yes
2005-04-29T14:50:00.000Z	hobocop		then it says Error "File not found" while copying "smb://laposin/...t%20(copy).iso".
2005-04-29T14:51:00.000Z	hobocop		also one of my computers doesnt even show the folders inside the shared folder
2005-04-29T14:51:00.000Z	hobocop		even though I checked, browsable
2005-04-29T14:52:00.000Z	klaas	hobocop	I'm sorry, won't know, I never use nautilus for smb connections.
2005-04-29T14:52:00.000Z	hobocop		ah
2005-04-29T14:52:00.000Z	hobocop		what would you use?
2005-04-29T14:53:00.000Z	hobocop	klaas	I have eight minutes lmao, what would you use?
2005-04-29T14:53:00.000Z	klaas	hobocop	Mount

2005-04-29T14:54:00.000Z	hobocop		can I mount a hard drive from another computer?
2005-04-29T14:54:00.000Z	klaas		as root, and make sure you have smbfs installed: apt-get install smbfs
2005-04-29T14:55:00.000Z	klaas	hobocop	check out NFS
