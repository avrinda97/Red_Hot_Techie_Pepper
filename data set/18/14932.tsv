2005-09-28T12:20:00.000Z	othernoob		mmh, how do i kill a process when kill 1234 doesn't seem to work?
2005-09-28T12:20:00.000Z	IcemanV9	othernoob	kill -9 1234
2005-09-28T12:21:00.000Z	othernoob	IcemanV9	didn't work either..
2005-09-28T12:22:00.000Z	othernoob	IcemanV9	yea, but it's still there..
2005-09-28T12:22:00.000Z	IcemanV9	othernoob	try to run top, then kill it from there?
2005-09-28T12:23:00.000Z	othernoob	IcemanV9	tried that as well before..
2005-09-28T12:24:00.000Z	IcemanV9	othernoob	w0w. okay. try to find the parent process .. and kill it
2005-09-28T12:24:00.000Z	othernoob	IcemanV9	uhm, how'd i find that?
2005-09-28T12:25:00.000Z	IcemanV9	othernoob	type 'ps aux |grep -i <whatever you're trying to kill app>' ... e.g. ps aux |grep -i xmms
2005-09-28T12:26:00.000Z	othernoob	IcemanV9	well, i've been doing that..albeit without the -i..for the last 5 mins.. :/
2005-09-28T12:26:00.000Z	othernoob	IcemanV9	and the -i doesn't offer more processes..
2005-09-28T12:27:00.000Z	IcemanV9	othernoob	i don't know anymore to tell ya. :(
2005-09-28T12:27:00.000Z	IcemanV9	othernoob	what was it were you trying to kill??
2005-09-28T12:27:00.000Z	othernoob	IcemanV9	me neither..k3b..
2005-09-28T12:27:00.000Z	othernoob	IcemanV9	i'm almost tempted to reboot :(
2005-09-28T12:28:00.000Z	IcemanV9	othernoob	wait a minute ... is your cd drive empty?? OR cd is running like crazy and won't stop/eject?
2005-09-28T12:28:00.000Z	othernoob	IcemanV9	my cddrive is empty
2005-09-28T12:30:00.000Z	othernoob	IcemanV9	i thought so too.. if it hadn't been empty and/or was spinning i'd have umounted it first and/or ejected..
