2008-09-01T06:09:00.000Z	dasdajs		Now i've tried everything to get oidentd working, but i still wont, can someone help me? :S
2008-09-01T06:09:00.000Z	Starnestommy	dasdajs	are you behind a router?
2008-09-01T06:10:00.000Z	dasdajs	Starnestommy	well the server might be, but no restrictions, why?
2008-09-01T06:10:00.000Z	Starnestommy	dasdajs	you need to make sure that you can access port 113 from outside on that machine
2008-09-01T06:11:00.000Z	dasdajs	Starnestommy	why? :)
2008-09-01T06:11:00.000Z	Starnestommy	dasdajs	ident uses port 113
2008-09-01T06:11:00.000Z	dasdajs	Starnestommy	okay, tcp or udp? :)
2008-09-01T06:11:00.000Z	Starnestommy	dasdajs	only tcp
2008-09-01T06:11:00.000Z	dasdajs	Starnestommy	okay i'll try that, thanks
2008-09-01T06:14:00.000Z	dasdajs	Starnestommy	now i've opened for port 113, shall I restart sbnc/psybnc or?
2008-09-01T06:14:00.000Z	Starnestommy	dasdajs	just make sure that oidentd is running
2008-09-01T06:14:00.000Z	dasdajs	Starnestommy	okay, it is
2008-09-01T06:14:00.000Z	Starnestommy	dasdajs	you'll need to restart your bouncer for irc servers to see your ident reply
2008-09-01T06:15:00.000Z	dasdajs	Starnestommy	okay thanks
2008-09-01T06:21:00.000Z	dasdajs	Starnestommy	still won't work :S
2008-09-01T06:23:00.000Z	dasdajs	Starnestommy	any ideas? :S
2008-09-01T06:28:00.000Z	Starnestommy	dasdajs	in what way is it not working?
2008-09-01T06:28:00.000Z	dasdajs	Starnestommy	I think the port is not opened, 2secs
