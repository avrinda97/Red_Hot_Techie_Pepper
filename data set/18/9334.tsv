2007-04-19T12:20:00.000Z	dlinsky		I can connect to the current desktop on the remote machine, but I want to log on to another X session
2007-04-19T12:20:00.000Z	disasm	dlinsky	ah, you mean vnc into a computer and bring up a login?
2007-04-19T12:21:00.000Z	disasm	dlinsky	http://doc.gwos.org/index.php/VNC_GDM
2007-04-19T12:22:00.000Z	dlinsky	disasm	I did this but I either don't get a stable connection (reset by remote socket) or I only see a blank X surface
2007-04-19T12:30:00.000Z	disasm	dlinsky	not sure what to do then, that should just work, do you get any errors on the server in a log somewhere?
2007-04-19T12:31:00.000Z	dlinsky	disasm	None that I'd knew about... On Windows side the VNC client sometimes crashes with socket exceptions
2007-04-19T12:40:00.000Z	dlinsky	disasm	Have you dome something like that yet?
2007-04-19T12:58:00.000Z	dlinsky	disasm	Do I need to run x11vnc on a different display for remote connections? If so, how do I do this?
2007-04-19T12:59:00.000Z	disasm	dlinsky	the stuff in xinetd should start a new display for incoming connections
2007-04-19T13:00:00.000Z	dlinsky	disasm	But without a server running on startup there won't be any incoming connections... so I might have to start the server manually?
2007-04-19T13:01:00.000Z	disasm	dlinsky	I don't think you understand inetd, it starts a process when a request is made to use a port
2007-04-19T13:07:00.000Z	dlinsky	disasm	Now the client cannot connect to the service... looks like there is nothing starting up
2007-04-19T13:08:00.000Z	disasm	dlinsky	have you rebooted since going through all the steps in the page I linked for you?
2007-04-19T13:09:00.000Z	dlinsky	disasm	Yeah, several times
2007-04-19T13:09:00.000Z	disasm	dlinsky	I'm stumped without looking at it, sorry :(
2007-04-19T13:10:00.000Z	dlinsky	disasm	which files you'd need?
2007-04-19T13:11:00.000Z	disasm	dlinsky	I'm a lil' busy right now at work, if you want some help, send an e-mail to disasm@gentux.org and I'll get back to you later
2007-04-19T13:11:00.000Z	dlinsky	disasm	Fine, thanks. :)
