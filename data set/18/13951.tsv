2005-09-30T13:33:00.000Z	Jan_		hihi all
2005-09-30T13:33:00.000Z	Jan_		We just installed Ubuntu on a laptop, and it all works nicely except for DVD playback.
2005-09-30T13:33:00.000Z	Jan_		Totem says "Totem could not play 'dvd://' Error invoking "dvdnav_get_next_block": Error reading NAV packet"
2005-09-30T13:34:00.000Z	Jan_		*heavenly chorus*
2005-09-30T13:34:00.000Z	Jan_		Yes.
2005-09-30T13:35:00.000Z	Jan_		I assumed it would be something like that.
2005-09-30T13:35:00.000Z	Bad_Magic	Jan_	theres a walkthrough at www.ubuntuguide.org
2005-09-30T13:39:00.000Z	Bad_Magic	Jan_	yea... i tried hibernating mine today and when it restarted it came back to a garbled gnome desktop and was locked hard
2005-09-30T13:48:00.000Z	Bad_Magic	Jan_	Im using hoary on my laptop atm and it runs well aside from hibernate
2005-09-30T13:48:00.000Z	Jan_	Bad_Magic	well this won't, and it sort of has to
2005-09-30T13:57:00.000Z	Bad_Magic	Jan_	sudo dpkg [etc] 
2005-09-30T14:00:00.000Z	Bad_Magic	Jan_	http://ubuntuguide.org/#dvdplayback
2005-09-30T14:01:00.000Z	Jan_	Bad_Magic	I am concerned that "hoary" appears in the config line I was told to use
2005-09-30T14:03:00.000Z	Bad_Magic	Jan_	Breezy is in beta release atm... as in its not finished yet
2005-09-30T14:05:00.000Z	Bad_Magic	Jan_	do you have synaptic open?
2005-09-30T14:07:00.000Z	Bad_Magic	Jan_	When synaptic is open it "locks" all the files its using.... if you have it open close it and then run that command again
2005-09-30T15:36:00.000Z	Bad_Magic	Jan_	did you ever have any luck getting your dvd player to go?
2005-10-01T07:18:00.000Z	Bad_Magic	Jan_	it takes a minute to dump ram to disk... try giving it a minute first
