2007-11-15T03:40:00.000Z	four-o-four		is hal related to xserver?
2007-11-15T03:40:00.000Z	Ademan	four-o-four	well hal is related to hardware detection and other things i believe, so if your video card or anything isn't being detected or used properly, that could cause x to fail
2007-11-15T03:42:00.000Z	four-o-four	Ademan	I have removed hal in Xserver not command mode! that's Y it caused sine problems, but now using recovery mode doesn't work
2007-11-15T03:42:00.000Z	Ademan	four-o-four	heh, why'd you remove hal?
2007-11-15T03:42:00.000Z	four-o-four	Ademan	it had problems ;)
2007-11-15T03:43:00.000Z	Ademan	four-o-four	heh, well it's rather essential to most applications as far as i can tell
2007-11-15T03:43:00.000Z	four-o-four	Ademan	I know that! but what to do now? any way?
2007-11-15T03:44:00.000Z	Ademan	four-o-four	i'd just reinstall hal and go from there, i really don't know exactly what problems you were experiencing, what actions you took, and what your problems are now, except apparently Xorg isn't working
2007-11-15T03:45:00.000Z	four-o-four	Ademan	rm & inst -> problems with dbus
2007-11-15T03:47:00.000Z	four-o-four	Ademan	so, what are the package to reconfigure or reinstall to solve my prob?!
2007-11-15T03:47:00.000Z	four-o-four	Ademan	I don't wanna reinstall whole ubuntu:(
2007-11-15T03:47:00.000Z	Ademan	four-o-four	well what exactly did you do?
2007-11-15T03:48:00.000Z	four-o-four	Ademan	first hal had problems, usb port wouldn't work
2007-11-15T03:48:00.000Z	four-o-four	Ademan	then I removed it:D
2007-11-15T03:49:00.000Z	four-o-four	Ademan	and install it again
2007-11-15T03:50:00.000Z	Ademan	four-o-four	sorry i meant ubuntu-minimal and ubuntu-desktop
2007-11-15T03:51:00.000Z	four-o-four	Ademan	then it could detect my fulldisk but after resetting..oops:D
2007-11-15T03:51:00.000Z	four-o-four	Ademan	tnx, I go to try what U said;)
