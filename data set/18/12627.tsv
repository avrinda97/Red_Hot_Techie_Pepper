2006-03-30T08:47:00.000Z	Mischevious		can anyone tell me why my ipod has 78 unallocated megabytes?
2006-03-30T08:47:00.000Z	Mischevious		i just noticed it in gparted..
2006-03-30T08:47:00.000Z	pauldaoust	Mischevious	because you just haven't found enough songs yet; that's why ;)
2006-03-30T08:47:00.000Z	Mischevious	pauldaoust	it' not free space, it's unallocated as in no fs
2006-03-30T08:47:00.000Z	pauldaoust	Mischevious	oh, as in, unpartitioned. ha. sorry
2006-03-30T08:49:00.000Z	Mischevious	pauldaoust	why do you think it is
2006-03-30T08:49:00.000Z	pauldaoust	Mischevious	not the foggiest. probably some weird Apple thingy.
2006-03-30T08:50:00.000Z	pauldaoust	Mischevious	don't have an iPod myself.
2006-03-30T08:50:00.000Z	Mischevious	pauldaoust	i never noticed it my self till i fired up gparted right now
2006-03-30T08:51:00.000Z	Mischevious	pauldaoust	it's okay i just merged the two partitions into fat32
2006-03-30T08:51:00.000Z	pauldaoust	Mischevious	good stuff. does it still work? :P
2006-03-30T08:51:00.000Z	Mischevious	pauldaoust	tell ya in a sec :-p
2006-03-30T08:52:00.000Z	Mischevious	pauldaoust	nope now it's complaining :-P probably shouldn't have done that
2006-03-30T08:56:00.000Z	Mischevious	pauldaoust	lol my ipod didn't like deleting that partition
2006-03-30T08:57:00.000Z	pauldaoust	Mischevious	oh dear. so what happened now? I was worried that it might be some fancy spot for the OS.
2006-03-30T08:57:00.000Z	Mischevious	pauldaoust	i just need to run the apple updater utility, no worries
2006-03-30T08:57:00.000Z	pauldaoust	Mischevious	hope that's all you need to do :)
2006-03-30T08:57:00.000Z	Mischevious	pauldaoust	it is.
