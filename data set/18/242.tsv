2012-05-25T08:57:00.000Z	squarepeg		hello
2012-05-25T08:58:00.000Z	squarepeg		I'm trying to upgrade a package
2012-05-25T08:58:00.000Z	squarepeg		I had the package pinned, so it didn't upgrade when I did a dist-upgrade to precise
2012-05-25T08:59:00.000Z	squarepeg		now I've erased the /etc/apt/preferences.d/file
2012-05-25T08:59:00.000Z	squarepeg		and The following packages have been kept back: libapache2-mod-php5 libglib2.0-0 php-pear php5 php5-cgi
2012-05-25T08:59:00.000Z	squarepeg		when I try to update
2012-05-25T09:00:00.000Z	squarepeg		I'm supposed to have php5.3 not php5.2
2012-05-25T09:00:00.000Z	squarepeg		I checked the packages on the website for precise
2012-05-25T09:00:00.000Z	EliahKagan	squarepeg	how are you trying to update? if you're using the command-line, what command are you running?
2012-05-25T09:00:00.000Z	squarepeg	EliahKagan	dpkg --configure -a
2012-05-25T09:01:00.000Z	squarepeg	EliahKagan	and then apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
2012-05-25T09:01:00.000Z	EliahKagan		i wonder if the packages being kept back is unrelated to the package that had been pinned
2012-05-25T09:01:00.000Z	EliahKagan		when you run sudo apt-get upgrade, it will only update packages that can be updated without installing or removing other packages
2012-05-25T09:02:00.000Z	EliahKagan		have you tried sudo apt-get dist-upgrade ?
2012-05-25T09:02:00.000Z	squarepeg	EliahKagan	that's relevant
2012-05-25T09:02:00.000Z	squarepeg		I'll try that.
2012-05-25T09:02:00.000Z	EliahKagan		(it's not only, or even primarily, for upgrading to a new release -- in fact, except for "early" upgrades to unstable releases, it is not a recommended way to upgrade released in Ubuntu)
2012-05-25T09:02:00.000Z	squarepeg	EliahKagan	that's the ticket right there.
