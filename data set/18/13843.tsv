2007-03-01T11:13:00.000Z	james296		can somebody help me?
2007-03-01T11:14:00.000Z	james296		reason I asked is because last time I asked no one responded
2007-03-01T11:15:00.000Z	james296		I need to know how to fix the smoothness in the system fonts, I'll tell you what happened, its only 2 lines of script
2007-03-01T11:16:00.000Z	james296		Tip: if Microsoft core fonts are too small you can improve the look by importing configuration file:
2007-03-01T11:16:00.000Z	james296		wget http://www.osresources.com/files/centos-windows-fonts/fontconfig.tbz
2007-03-01T11:16:00.000Z	james296		sudo tar xvjpf fontconfig.tbz -C /etc/fonts/
2007-03-01T11:16:00.000Z	james296		thats all I did
2007-03-01T11:17:00.000Z	james296		then it made the fonts, not so smooth lol
2007-03-01T11:17:00.000Z	eck	james296	you probably borked /etc/fonts/fonts.conf
2007-03-01T11:18:00.000Z	eck	james296	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/8055/
2007-03-01T11:20:00.000Z	eck	james296	that is the one that is on my computer (and i have not changed it)
2007-03-01T11:20:00.000Z	eck	james296	yes
2007-03-03T10:22:00.000Z	eck	james296	do you know about the locate command?
2007-03-03T10:23:00.000Z	eck	james296	it's in /etc/fonts, but in the future you should just use locate or find to find out where it is
2007-03-03T10:24:00.000Z	eck	james296	it's also documented in the man page
2007-03-03T10:27:00.000Z	eck	james296	did you delete it?
2007-03-03T10:28:00.000Z	eck	james296	i'll pastebin mine for you
