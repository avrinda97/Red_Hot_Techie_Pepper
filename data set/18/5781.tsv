2008-11-15T22:10:00.000Z	ldiamond		I need help here, I'm unable to install firefox using apt-get. Also, all versions of Firefox that I installed kept crashing constantly.
2008-11-15T22:11:00.000Z	ldiamond		I installed it from the repo, kept crashing, I installed it from the FF site, kept crashing, I installed the newer version from FF site, crashed again, now I'm unable to install it from the repo again
2008-11-15T22:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	ldiamond	is it all sites it crashes on?
2008-11-15T22:13:00.000Z	ldiamond	ActionParsnip1	yes, no matter what site, with no plugin or addon, even in safe mode
2008-11-15T22:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	ldiamond	try: mv ~/.mozilla Â¬/.mozilla_old; firefox &
2008-11-15T22:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	ldiamond	mv ~/.mozilla ~/.mozilla_old; firefox &
2008-11-15T22:14:00.000Z	ldiamond	ActionParsnip1	I already erased .mozilla many times in order to fix crashes
2008-11-15T22:14:00.000Z	ldiamond	ActionParsnip1	didnt help
2008-11-15T22:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	ldiamond	hmm any info in the terminal when firefox crashed?
2008-11-15T22:16:00.000Z	ldiamond	ActionParsnip1	Nop, it crashes and nothing is output on the terminal
2008-11-15T22:16:00.000Z	ldiamond	ActionParsnip1	This thing is driving me crazy!
2008-11-15T22:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	ldiamond	id also mv ~/.mozilla_old ~/.mozilla
2008-11-15T22:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	ldiamond	sudo apt-get --purge remove firefox-3.0; sudo apt-get autoremove; sudo apt-get clean; sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install firefox-3.0
2008-11-15T22:18:00.000Z	ldiamond	ActionParsnip1	I already tried purging, but not all of the above, Ill try them next time FF crashes
2008-11-15T22:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	ldiamond	it basically removes firefox and all its gumf, then cleans your apt-cache so you are forced to download fresh
2008-11-15T22:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	ldiamond	or you could use opera :D
2008-11-15T22:20:00.000Z	ldiamond	ActionParsnip1	yea I already downloaded opera, but I kinda like google toolbar in FF, and some other extensions
2008-11-15T22:20:00.000Z	ldiamond	ActionParsnip1	so Opera wouldnt be as nice (eventho its faster, for now)
