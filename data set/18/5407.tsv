2010-10-11T09:29:00.000Z	crimsun	Lancelot	hmm, we probably need to fix that.  Please see my original post @ https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel-discuss/2009-May/008239.html
2010-10-11T09:30:00.000Z	crimsun	Lancelot	i.e., file a bug, but change the release number as appropriate, please [9.10 -> 10.10]
2010-10-11T09:30:00.000Z	Lancelot	crimsun	do you work with the ALSA team?
2010-10-11T09:30:00.000Z	crimsun	Lancelot	yes.
2010-10-11T09:31:00.000Z	Lancelot	crimsun	brilliant, is crimsun the username you use on the ubuntu forums?
2010-10-11T09:31:00.000Z	crimsun	Lancelot	yes, and on LP and elsewhere, generally.
2010-10-11T09:31:00.000Z	crimsun	Lancelot	please note that I do not read the forums frequently.
2010-10-11T09:31:00.000Z	Lancelot	crimsun	okay...so how exactly do I file the bug on this page?
2010-10-11T09:32:00.000Z	crimsun	Lancelot	the URL that I provided explains a bit of the background and includes instructions.
2010-10-11T09:32:00.000Z	crimsun	Lancelot	briefly, you'll run the "ubuntu-bug alsa-base" command in a Terminal/Konsole
2010-10-11T09:32:00.000Z	Lancelot	crimsun	I see, well I'll try getting in there then. I actually commented out that line in alsa-config while trying to get my laptop's sub to work
2010-10-11T09:37:00.000Z	Lancelot	crimsun	I'll file that bug later
2010-10-11T09:39:00.000Z	Lancelot	crimsun	I'm currently using Karmic, does anything in Maverick fix this problem?
2010-10-11T09:40:00.000Z	crimsun	Lancelot	ah!  Well, we've done quite a bit of work in that regard, so yes, 10.10 should be better.
2010-10-11T09:42:00.000Z	Lancelot	crimsun	I'm still reluctant to upgrade, but that's mostly because I hate the purple thele :p
2010-10-11T09:42:00.000Z	crimsun	Lancelot	you aren't required to use that purple theme ;)
2010-10-11T09:51:00.000Z	Lancelot	crimsun	actually it isn't the speakers popping, it's literally a loud buzz
2010-10-11T09:51:00.000Z	Lancelot	crimsun	is it being caused by this?
