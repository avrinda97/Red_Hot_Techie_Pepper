2006-08-23T13:40:00.000Z	keitaro		Has anyone gotten VMWare on ubuntu to play nice with the sound? I've been reading the forums, but the vmware-esd wrappers don't work for me
2006-08-23T13:40:00.000Z	operative	keitaro	sure, just kill esd and use alsa
2006-08-23T13:41:00.000Z	keitaro	operative	alrighty
2006-08-23T13:42:00.000Z	keitaro	operative	any good pointers to look to install alsa?
2006-08-23T13:43:00.000Z	keitaro	operative	hmm alright its dead, so alsa takes over by default?
2006-08-23T13:44:00.000Z	operative	keitaro	alsa is whats producing your sounds, esd is mixing input from mainly gnome apps and passing that mixed pcm stream to alsa
2006-08-23T13:45:00.000Z	keitaro	operative	hmm well im still getting the /dev/dsp is busy
2006-08-23T13:46:00.000Z	keitaro	operative	no processes
2006-08-23T13:47:00.000Z	operative	keitaro	lsof | grep dsp

2006-08-23T13:50:00.000Z	operative	keitaro	you dont need to use the wrapper now, vmware can play nicely with alsa all on its own
2006-08-23T13:52:00.000Z	keitaro	operative	alright well i tried it again, killed vmware, same thing
2006-08-23T13:53:00.000Z	operative	keitaro	depends how you set this wrapper up I guess. All I can tell you is that vmware will run with alsa "out of the box"
2006-08-23T13:54:00.000Z	keitaro	operative	hmm. Well it works if im not playing any sound. The problem occurs when i have an mp3  playing on ubuntu, and try to play some sound on the VMwared OS
2006-08-23T13:54:00.000Z	operative	keitaro	ah ok - google dmix
2006-08-23T13:58:00.000Z	operative	keitaro	check out the output from ubotu on sound
2006-08-23T13:58:00.000Z	keitaro	operative	hmm?
2006-08-23T14:00:00.000Z	keitaro	operative	hmm i dont have that option in dapper
