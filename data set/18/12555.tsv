2006-04-05T16:29:00.000Z	arrick	rezuth	according to https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HardwareSupportComponentsWirelessNetworkCards your card is not plug and play supperted
2006-04-05T16:30:00.000Z	arrick	rezuth	yeah
2006-04-05T05:51:00.000Z	arrick	rezuth	yeah sometimes you need to relax for a while
2006-04-05T05:51:00.000Z	rezuth	arrick	:) I got so far that the driver and all is installed but somehow it refused to display art0
2006-04-05T05:54:00.000Z	arrick	rezuth	what do you mean grub is not working?
2006-04-05T06:22:00.000Z	rezuth	arrick	I got it working but I'm not able to do sudo once I log in, It says unable to get hostbyname()
2006-04-05T06:24:00.000Z	arrick	rezuth	if you are signed in as root, you dot need the sudo command
2006-04-05T06:25:00.000Z	arrick	rezuth	ubuntu has the root disabled by default, and makes you sign in under another name
2006-04-05T06:25:00.000Z	rezuth	arrick	so how do I sign in as root?
2006-04-05T06:32:00.000Z	arrick	rezuth	there should be a tutorial on how to sign in as root from the boot
