2006-11-07T10:53:00.000Z	charle97	firebird619	did you close the browsers completely before testing?
2006-11-07T10:54:00.000Z	firebird619	charle97	Yes. Firefox's about:plugins shows Flash 9, it just doesn't work for some reason.
2006-11-07T10:55:00.000Z	charle97	firebird619	are you using the noscript extension?
2006-11-07T10:55:00.000Z	firebird619	charle97	No, I am not.
2006-11-07T10:55:00.000Z	charle97	firebird619	where did you put the libflash file for firefox?
2006-11-07T10:58:00.000Z	firebird619	charle97	I put it in ~/.mozilla/plugins as well as /usr/lib/firefox/plugins
2006-11-07T11:00:00.000Z	firebird619	charle97	I use KDE and I tried in Konqueror as well and when I go to sites with flash, it comes up with the Crash Handler for nspluginviewer (I think this is the correct name).
2006-11-07T11:00:00.000Z	charle97	firebird619	hmm... don't know what could be wrong
2006-11-07T11:02:00.000Z	firebird619	charle97	In Konqueror, when I right click in the white space where the flash should be, it talks about Flash 7. Could Flash 7 be installed somewhere that I am unaware about and causing a conflict?
2006-11-07T11:03:00.000Z	charle97	firebird619	it might
2006-11-07T11:03:00.000Z	firebird619	charle97	How would I go about finding out and completly removing flash 7?
2006-11-07T11:03:00.000Z	charle97	firebird619	did you have flash 7 on ff before?
2006-11-07T11:04:00.000Z	firebird619	charle97	Yes, but that didn't work either. Thats one of the reasons I downloaded Flash 9.
2006-11-07T11:06:00.000Z	firebird619	charle97	Flash 9 must be half installed correctly beings FF recognizes it. But there is certainly something wrong.
2006-11-07T11:07:00.000Z	charle97	firebird619	maybe take out one of the files out
2006-11-07T11:07:00.000Z	charle97		since you have it in two places
2006-11-07T11:08:00.000Z	firebird619	charle97	Yes, I can give that a try. Flash 7 must still be hanging around in somewhere thought beings it shows that on the right click in Konqueror.
2006-11-07T11:10:00.000Z	firebird619	charle97	I will give removing it from one of the places a try. Thank you for your help.
