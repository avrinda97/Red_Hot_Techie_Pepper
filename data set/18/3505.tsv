2011-10-13T22:24:00.000Z	th__		hello, how the hell i make my desktop like it was in 10.04?? i mean basic gnome?
2011-10-13T22:25:00.000Z	th__		did they remove gnome-shell??
2011-10-13T22:26:00.000Z	th__		this is the last time im going to upgrade ubuntu!
2011-10-13T22:27:00.000Z	theadmin	th__	GNOME 2 is dead, the GNOME team killed it
2011-10-13T22:27:00.000Z	theadmin	th__	There is a fork developed by gnome2 fans called 'mate-desktop-environment'
2011-10-13T22:27:00.000Z	th__	theadmin	thats sad
2011-10-13T22:28:00.000Z	th__	theadmin	wich does what?
2011-10-13T22:29:00.000Z	theadmin	th__	It's a complete clone of gnome2
2011-10-13T22:29:00.000Z	theadmin	th__	But it's not really available for Ubuntu yet
2011-10-13T22:29:00.000Z	theadmin	th__	Might consider Xfce, it gives the gnome2 feeling to me
2011-10-13T22:29:00.000Z	th__	theadmin	nice. thanks for the info. you meaning theres no .deb yet?
2011-10-13T22:29:00.000Z	theadmin	th__	Yeah, the only real package there is is an AUR package
2011-10-13T22:30:00.000Z	th__	theadmin	im so hating this. i was so comfortable with my old setup.
2012-08-25T16:08:00.000Z	theadmin	th__	Simply "apt-get install" a new one.
2012-08-25T16:08:00.000Z	theadmin	th__	It will then change to the new one (actually give a menu selecting which you want)
2012-08-25T16:08:00.000Z	th__	theadmin	actually do you remember name of that "menu"
2012-08-25T16:09:00.000Z	theadmin	th__	You can switch to lightdm by doing this: sudo dpkg-reconfigure lightdm
2012-08-25T16:09:00.000Z	th__	theadmin	 that was it. thanks
