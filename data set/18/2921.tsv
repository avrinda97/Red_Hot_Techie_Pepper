2010-01-25T19:15:00.000Z	KrisKo		hello, i have my own bin directory with scripts, i added the dir to enviroment variables, it works correctly, but when i try to run my own command with sudo i get command not found? how could i fix this
2010-01-25T19:15:00.000Z	KrisKo		?
2010-01-25T19:15:00.000Z	grawity	KrisKo	'sudo' resets $PATH to the one root has.
2010-01-25T19:16:00.000Z	grawity	KrisKo	usually, I put such "system" binaries to /usr/local/bin.
2010-01-25T19:18:00.000Z	KrisKo	grawity	ok i'll put them to usr local lib.
2010-01-25T19:18:00.000Z	grawity	KrisKo	bin, not lib. lib is for libraries.
2010-01-25T19:18:00.000Z	KrisKo	grawity	:) sorry bin
2010-01-25T19:24:00.000Z	grawity	KrisKo	Where have you set them?
2010-01-25T19:24:00.000Z	KrisKo	grawity	~/.bash_aliases, adn added line to ~/.bashrc
2010-01-25T19:25:00.000Z	grawity	KrisKo	Do you have a ~/.profile, or ~/.bash_profile, or ~/.bash_login? (Any of these.)
2010-01-25T19:25:00.000Z	grawity	KrisKo	If yes, does it contain a line saying '. ~/.bashrc' or 'source ~/.bashrc'?
2010-01-25T19:25:00.000Z	KrisKo	grawity	only .profile
2010-01-25T19:25:00.000Z	grawity	KrisKo	Okay, now does it contain a line saying '. ~/.bashrc' or 'source ~/.bashrc'?
2010-01-25T19:26:00.000Z	KrisKo	grawity	no, it doesn't
2010-01-25T19:26:00.000Z	grawity	KrisKo	Then add it.
2010-01-25T19:26:00.000Z	grawity	KrisKo	Or, pastebin the entire ~/.profile if you can.
2010-01-25T19:27:00.000Z	KrisKo	grawity	the only line there uncommented is: test -z "$PROFILEREAD" && . /etc/profile || true
2010-01-25T19:32:00.000Z	KrisKo	grawity	thank you, I added the '. ~/.bashrc', now it works.
