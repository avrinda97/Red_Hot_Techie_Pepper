2012-03-12T07:50:00.000Z	Pickleface		hi, I cannot access my main account for some reason, I type in the pw and a blank screen appears......>>?
2012-03-12T07:51:00.000Z	sacarlson	Pickleface	did you try boot recovery mode and maybe create a new user account and try login to that?
2012-03-12T07:52:00.000Z	Pickleface	sacarlson	well I can go on the guest account, im on it now....
2012-03-12T07:53:00.000Z	sacarlson	Pickleface	oh ok so maybe make a new admin account then.  it must be a config setting that can be cleared but you might loose somthing you want
2012-03-12T07:54:00.000Z	Pickleface	sacarlson	i'm trying....
2012-03-12T07:55:00.000Z	sacarlson	Pickleface	what are you trying?  makeing a new admin?  you would still have to boot into recovery to get a sudo user and maybe modify /etc/sudoer to temp add your guest to be admin until you fix stuf
2012-03-12T07:57:00.000Z	sacarlson	Pickleface	it may be a good idea to keep another sudo account that you don't modify so that if this happens again you will have the power to easy fix it

2012-03-12T08:32:00.000Z	sacarlson	Pickleface	I missed the method you used to create a new account
2012-03-12T08:33:00.000Z	Pickleface	sacarlson	went to user accounts on the guest account, gave my root pw and it let me make a new one, then I deleted my old admin account, a few minutes later I get a error saying both have failed
2012-03-12T08:34:00.000Z	sacarlson	Pickleface	I don't think I would have deleted the account I would have just create a 2nd admin, but I guess it's too late now
2012-03-12T08:35:00.000Z	Pickleface	sacarlson	yeah lol, what should I do now though?......
2012-03-12T08:35:00.000Z	sacarlson	Pickleface	I take it you now deleted the only working admin account so you will have to create another by boot into recovery
2012-03-12T08:36:00.000Z	Pickleface	sacarlson	uh, can you tell me how to do that ?
2012-03-12T08:36:00.000Z	sacarlson	Pickleface	at what point?  boot into recovery?
2012-03-12T08:37:00.000Z	Pickleface	sacarlson	how do I boot into recovery ? then make a new account from there ?
2012-03-12T08:38:00.000Z	Pickleface	sacarlson	okay then what?
2012-03-12T08:41:00.000Z	sacarlson	Pickleface	sudo adduser <username> admin
