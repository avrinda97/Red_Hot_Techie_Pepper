2007-07-08T10:29:00.000Z	banlieue		lol, !root is so fruity
2007-07-08T10:30:00.000Z	banlieue		gizmo project might be an option, depending on what you're trying to do, ian_wax
2007-07-08T10:31:00.000Z	banlieue		it doesn't matter who writes them or why it is, ian_wax is right
2007-07-08T10:32:00.000Z	banlieue		!hardware
2007-07-08T10:34:00.000Z	banlieue		going from vista to xp is a good idea anyway:)
2007-07-08T10:35:00.000Z	banlieue		so buy Dell
2007-07-08T10:35:00.000Z	banlieue		or build your own
2007-07-08T10:35:00.000Z	banlieue		(buy Dell laptops, and build your own desktops)
2007-07-08T10:36:00.000Z	banlieue		system76 is way too expensive
2007-07-08T10:36:00.000Z	TreMobyl	banlieue	muuh?
2007-07-08T10:37:00.000Z	TreMobyl		just don't forget our friends at system76 with all this dell hype.  :)
2007-07-08T10:37:00.000Z	banlieue		last I checked system76 was too expensive for the hardware they sell
2007-07-08T10:37:00.000Z	banlieue		might be because they're serving a niche, i don't know
2007-07-08T10:37:00.000Z	TreMobyl	banlieue	I'd be interested in that comparison, 'cause they didn't seem that way to me
2007-07-08T10:38:00.000Z	banlieue		the prices on dell hardware (own product lines excluded) are very reasonable imo
2007-07-08T10:38:00.000Z	TreMobyl		regardless, buying PCs Designed For Windows and expecting them to work with Linux is (hopefully, mostly) over now
2007-07-08T10:38:00.000Z	banlieue	Jordan_U	I realise that, doesn't change the fact they're more expensive ;)
2007-07-08T10:38:00.000Z	TreMobyl	banlieue	could be, but I didn't find system76 to be expensive when I looked at it
