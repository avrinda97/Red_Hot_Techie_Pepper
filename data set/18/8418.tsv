2007-08-22T14:48:00.000Z	eallik		I'm not sure if this is a place to ask this, but does anyone know if it's possible to somehow tune my Gnome/Ubuntu installation to make windows draw faster or at least the whole window at one time, instead of different parts of it being drawn sequentially?
2007-08-22T14:49:00.000Z	Techgurl	eallik	what video driver are you using
2007-08-22T14:49:00.000Z	eallik	Techgurl	are you sure this is about my graphics card? but ATI open source driver and the card itself is Mobile Radeon 9700
2007-08-22T14:50:00.000Z	Techgurl	eallik	not but the best performance is probably with the ATI proprietary driver
2007-08-22T14:51:00.000Z	eallik	Techgurl	I've tested with the proprietary driver and the performance is 10x worse
2007-08-22T14:51:00.000Z	Techgurl	eallik	ok then
2007-08-22T14:51:00.000Z	Techgurl	eallik	but I don't know what the problem is but the windows should not be drawing that slow
2007-08-22T14:52:00.000Z	eallik	Techgurl	it might have been the settings, but I don't think any setting can cause a 10x drop in performance
2007-08-22T14:52:00.000Z	eallik	Techgurl	they're not VERY slow, but enough to be annoying... on Win XP everything is lightning fast
2007-08-22T14:53:00.000Z	Techgurl	eallik	might be an ati bug
2007-08-22T14:54:00.000Z	eallik	Techgurl	but Desktop Effects (Compiz) runs smooth enough
2007-08-22T14:55:00.000Z	Techgurl	eallik	try turning off desktop effects and see if that helps performance
2007-08-22T14:57:00.000Z	eallik	Techgurl	I don't have desktop effects turned on, but I know they're smooth
2007-08-22T14:58:00.000Z	eallik	Techgurl	besides, for instance, window resizing is equally VERY slow both with and without effects
2007-08-22T14:59:00.000Z	Techgurl	eallik	are you running at a high resolution?
2007-08-22T14:59:00.000Z	eallik	Techgurl	1400x1050
2007-08-22T14:59:00.000Z	Techgurl	eallik	I don't use ATI but it sounds related
2007-08-22T15:00:00.000Z	eallik	Techgurl	so you still think it's graphics related? beucase for me it doesn't make sense because it's just plain flat 2D
