2008-06-12T08:16:00.000Z	Zoem		I am running beta drivers for Nvidia 9600gt video card. My problem is, they keep getting kicked out of the kernel on reboot. How do I prevent this?
2008-06-12T08:16:00.000Z	zloog	Zoem	Do you mean the system crashes or just X windows?
2008-06-12T08:17:00.000Z	Zoem	zloog	I mean, the driver is not in the kernel after reboot, I just run the install script again. System and X are stable whenever I'm running
2008-06-12T08:18:00.000Z	zloog	Zoem	Oh, do you know the name of the driver's kernel module?
2008-06-12T08:18:00.000Z	Zoem	zloog	umm... no, but it shouldn't be too hard to find... modprobe -l for list, right?
2008-06-12T08:20:00.000Z	Zoem	zloog	I am going to guess that the driver is nvidia_new.ko in /lib/modules/2.6.24-18generic/volatile/
2008-06-12T08:20:00.000Z	zloog	Zoem	yup, you just need to put the module name into the /etc/modules file.  Also you might want to blacklist the old modules by putting the old module name into /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist
2008-06-12T08:21:00.000Z	zloog	Zoem	I'm by no means an expert but I bet that will fix your problem
2008-06-12T08:21:00.000Z	Zoem	zloog	I'll give it a try, worst case, I undo it and keep on as I have been
2008-06-12T08:22:00.000Z	Zoem	zloog	 thanks for the help :)
2008-06-12T08:34:00.000Z	zloog	Zoem	Hi, any luck?
2008-06-12T08:34:00.000Z	Zoem	zloog	oh, no, I haven't actually tried it yet :) But since I've switched irc to a different comp, I might as well. rebooting :)
2008-06-12T08:40:00.000Z	Zoem	zloog	hmm, no luck.
2008-06-12T08:40:00.000Z	zloog	Zoem	Sorry thats the only way I know of to force a module to load at boot. And the onlything ive ever used it for is a bluetooth keyboard.
2008-06-12T08:42:00.000Z	Zoem	zloog	I think it has something to do with the module being in /lib/modules/2.6.24-18-generic/volatile. So, I guess I'll just wait for NV to put out a real driver ;(
2008-06-12T08:42:00.000Z	zloog	Zoem	Sorry, that was literally my one piece of advice to give you. I'm pretty module dumb :(
2008-06-12T08:43:00.000Z	Zoem	zloog	its ok, I wouldn't have asked if I weren't even more so :)
2008-06-12T08:43:00.000Z	Zoem	zloog	oh, look at that. NV has released drivers for my card :D
