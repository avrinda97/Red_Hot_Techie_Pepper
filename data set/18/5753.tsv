2008-08-26T09:22:00.000Z	[T]BludShoT		damn
2008-08-26T09:22:00.000Z	[T]BludShoT		guess ubuntu wont work, i'm gonna try CentOS
2008-08-26T09:23:00.000Z	Gnea	[T]BludShoT	what's not working?
2008-08-26T09:26:00.000Z	[T]BludShoT	Gnea	what do you think about that
2008-08-26T09:27:00.000Z	Gnea	[T]BludShoT	non-live cd?
2008-08-26T09:28:00.000Z	Gnea	[T]BludShoT	what system do you have?
2008-08-26T09:29:00.000Z	Gnea	[T]BludShoT	yeah - is it a pre-built or did you build it yourself?
2008-08-26T09:30:00.000Z	Gnea	[T]BludShoT	okay, so go all out - what's the cpu, ram, hd, cd, etc? :)
2008-08-26T09:32:00.000Z	Gnea	[T]BludShoT	hrm. yeah. you're a bit short of memory. i had some systems that are similar to that that i tried to install ubuntu on, and anything less than 256 megs of ram would simply not work right.
2008-08-26T09:33:00.000Z	Gnea	[T]BludShoT	if i were you, i'd try to increase the memory, or try a distro that's less resource intensive
2008-08-26T09:33:00.000Z	Gnea	[T]BludShoT	i have heard good things about mint linux lately
2008-08-26T09:35:00.000Z	Gnea	[T]BludShoT	okay - if it's going to be a server, why install an OS with a GUI?
2008-08-26T09:37:00.000Z	Gnea	[T]BludShoT	do you have another ubuntu system laying around?
2008-08-26T09:37:00.000Z	Gnea	[T]BludShoT	what are you typing on now? wintendo?
2008-08-26T09:41:00.000Z	Gnea	[T]BludShoT	my suggestion would be, is if you can figure out a way to display remote X applications on your XP system, install ubuntu server on the system and set it up, then just export X display to the XP system and run any GUIs you need that way
2008-08-26T09:44:00.000Z	Gnea	[T]BludShoT	yeah - the GUI seems to be your major drawback on there, and since it's going to be a server anyway, would it not be better to devote those resources to apache?
2008-08-26T09:44:00.000Z	[T]BludShoT	Gnea	yeah i guess i'll try that. I mean, it seems logical that the reason ubuntu 8 can't install is cuz its just not light weight enough for this old crappy computer
2008-08-26T09:45:00.000Z	Gnea	[T]BludShoT	like i said, i've had the same problem, and solved it the same way - it's just a matter of reallocating resources to their most effectiveness
