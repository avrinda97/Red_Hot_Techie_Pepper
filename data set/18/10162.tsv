2007-02-15T10:43:00.000Z	elyon225	blazemonger	You could have bought a BETTER nvidia card for the price you spent on that postage ;)
2007-02-15T10:45:00.000Z	elyon225	blazemonger	ALL Linux systems are incredibly different, but Ubuntu took the longest for me to get running well... but now that it is (for the most part)... I love it.
2007-02-15T10:46:00.000Z	elyon225	blazemonger	Hmm... about 15 reinstalls and a month :)
2007-02-15T10:48:00.000Z	elyon225	blazemonger	Also... to put it into perspective - I had a Radeon 9600 (much newer than the Rage128)... and I eventually had to give it up to get Ubuntu to work.
