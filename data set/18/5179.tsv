2008-12-02T03:14:00.000Z	bdelin88		the default "save" file for 07 office is DOCX
2008-12-02T03:14:00.000Z	bdelin88		unless specified, so most ppl are starting to send me DOCX
2008-12-02T03:15:00.000Z	bdelin88		and i am having to use virtual box's crappy sound emulation with little blips in and out so that i can listen to yahoo radio :), i guess i could wine IE on here... but see... more tinkering...
2008-12-02T03:16:00.000Z	bdelin88		i realize that most of this if not all of it is NOT ubuntu's fault... but it's all a big pain in the ass
2008-12-02T03:17:00.000Z	bdelin88		and yes i am just ranting to the whole channel
2008-12-02T03:17:00.000Z	bdelin88		lo
2008-12-02T03:17:00.000Z	bdelin88		lol ikonia
2008-12-02T03:19:00.000Z	bdelin88		well one thing that still frustrates the hell out of me... is that intrepid was supposed to be an update based on network compatibility and things like that, yet I still don't see a GUI for Internet connection sharing or network bridging?  I mean c'mon...
2008-12-02T03:20:00.000Z	bdelin88		i don't want to go through command line hell just to accomplish the few simple options that windows DOES provide
2008-12-02T03:21:00.000Z	bdelin88		who is trying to set up dual monitors? i just set it up, i can help out :)
2008-12-02T03:22:00.000Z	ryushe	bdelin88	bojtel is
2008-12-02T03:35:00.000Z	bdelin88	ryushe	are u there
2008-12-02T03:36:00.000Z	ryushe	bdelin88	yeah, one sec please
2008-12-02T03:37:00.000Z	ryushe	bdelin88	of course, he mentioned two screens, I don't assume separate X screens running unless told so.
2008-12-02T03:37:00.000Z	ryushe	bdelin88	:)
2008-12-02T03:39:00.000Z	bdelin88	ryushe	do you remember if it was twinview or xinerama that you can't have two different resolutions?
2008-12-02T03:52:00.000Z	bdelin88	ryushe	I was able to configure my settings with just the nvidia control panel
2008-12-02T03:53:00.000Z	ryushe	bdelin88	same here, but he wasn't for some reason. I think cause the 42" screen he's connecting is non-standard
