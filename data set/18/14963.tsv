2005-05-23T08:37:00.000Z	refuze2looze		do i have to install GLIBC from source?
2005-05-23T08:38:00.000Z	HappyFool	refuze2looze	why would you want to that?
2005-05-23T08:39:00.000Z	refuze2looze	HappyFool	well i need to install GLIBC 2.3.4 and i don't see it on apt-get (universe multiverse is all enabled)
2005-05-23T08:39:00.000Z	refuze2looze	HappyFool	i tried installing it from source and it got 2 errors during compile somewhere
2005-05-23T08:42:00.000Z	HappyFool	refuze2looze	it might be easier to compile and install gimpshop than glibc
2005-05-23T08:43:00.000Z	HappyFool	refuze2looze	check the release notes / readme to see if there's a required glibc
2005-05-23T08:43:00.000Z	refuze2looze	HappyFool	there is indeeed
2005-05-23T08:44:00.000Z	HappyFool	refuze2looze	search for libc
2005-05-23T08:45:00.000Z	refuze2looze	HappyFool	ah okay, at least i see the version i have installed 2.3.2 in synaptic now
2005-05-23T08:47:00.000Z	refuze2looze	HappyFool	why unhappiness?
2005-05-23T08:47:00.000Z	HappyFool	refuze2looze	i dunno. upgrading glibc strikes me as dangerous ;)
2005-05-23T08:48:00.000Z	refuze2looze	HappyFool	i like to live dangerously ;P
2005-05-23T08:50:00.000Z	HappyFool	refuze2looze	i haven't read this page in detail, but it doesn't mention a specific glibc version: http://linux.suramya.com/tutorials/Install_GIMPShop/
2005-05-23T08:50:00.000Z	refuze2looze	HappyFool	if you look under "2.0 Pre-Requisites" it's listed "GLib >= 2.4.5"
2005-05-23T08:51:00.000Z	refuze2looze	HappyFool	and i'll have you know i just installed it and gimpshop seems to be working :)
2005-05-23T08:52:00.000Z	HappyFool	refuze2looze	hoary has glib 2.6.3
2005-06-14T14:34:00.000Z	HappyFool	refuze2looze	indeed. gcc, g++ and make
2005-06-14T14:34:00.000Z	refuze2looze	HappyFool	the first thing i did was take the cdrom source out of my sources.list so i dont know what's on the cd
