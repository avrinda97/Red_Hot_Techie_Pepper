2011-12-06T21:45:00.000Z	bbbbbbbb		i cant connect to wireless, i see "wireless is disabled by hardware switch". the only hw switch i know is a fn-hotkey that shows no reaction
2011-12-06T21:46:00.000Z	overdub	bbbbbbbb	are you on a Thinkpad?
2011-12-06T21:46:00.000Z	bbbbbbbb	overdub	no, a HP
2011-12-06T21:47:00.000Z	overdub	bbbbbbbb	my thinkpad has a physical switch for on/off hardward wireless, don't know about HP
2011-12-06T21:47:00.000Z	bbbbbbbb	overdub	i only have a fn+f12 hetkey, the led indicates its off. cant figure out how to switch it on
2011-12-06T21:47:00.000Z	overdub	bbbbbbbb	might be disabled in BIOS?
2011-12-06T21:48:00.000Z	bbbbbbbb	overdub	don't think so, it worked in windows
2011-12-06T21:53:00.000Z	overdub	bbbbbbbb	did it work before and suddenly not?
2011-12-06T21:53:00.000Z	bbbbbbbb	overdub	i haven't used it in quite some time and not at all on ubuntu. it did work a while ago on win7
2011-12-06T21:54:00.000Z	overdub	bbbbbbbb	might be that there is no support yet for HP fn key, just a guess
2011-12-06T21:54:00.000Z	bbbbbbbb	overdub	how would i enable it then?
2011-12-06T21:54:00.000Z	overdub	bbbbbbbb	i had this problem with debian, couldn't adjust screen brightness, was very annoying
2011-12-06T21:55:00.000Z	bbbbbbbb	overdub	the other hotkeys work fine
2011-12-06T21:55:00.000Z	overdub	bbbbbbbb	probably not that then, i'm out of suggestions, good luck
2011-12-06T21:56:00.000Z	bbbbbbbb	overdub	i don't know, i remember that at the beginning the wifi was always on. i might have switched it off, but i don't rememeber where -.- any idea? ^^
2011-12-06T21:56:00.000Z	overdub	bbbbbbbb	on my thinkpad, if I boot up with the wifi switch off, turning it on after Ubuntu is running doesn't activate it
2011-12-06T21:59:00.000Z	overdub	bbbbbbbb	maybe it was off during boot up, and the driver for your wifi didn't get loaded, I'd try rebooting with the wifi on
2011-12-06T22:00:00.000Z	bbbbbbbb	overdub	okay, i'll try that later
