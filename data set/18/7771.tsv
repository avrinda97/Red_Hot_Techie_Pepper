2008-03-19T08:20:00.000Z	RedHeron	Broam	 How does one go about signing it?
2008-03-19T08:29:00.000Z	RedHeron	Broam	I'm still not able to see how to sign it... where do I send it after I sign it?
2008-03-19T08:30:00.000Z	Broam	RedHeron	I believe there are instructions on the wiki. It's been a long time...you have to register the key on launchpad, and then they send you a request that's encrypted (decrypt with your private key) that has the instructions
2008-03-19T08:30:00.000Z	RedHeron	Broam	 I'm regged on launchpad already.
