2008-02-09T19:05:00.000Z	speart		Is there a site where people show all the cool stuff they did with Ubuntu?
2008-02-09T19:05:00.000Z	speart		search for particular adapter
2008-02-09T19:07:00.000Z	speart		"cool ubuntu" returned pretty not cool stuff
2008-02-09T19:09:00.000Z	speart		so don't
2008-02-09T19:10:00.000Z	speart		if you got some time, try gimp and other stuff
2008-02-09T19:10:00.000Z	grndslm	speart	 not specifically ubuntu, but i found this neat site the other day... haven't got around to messing with some of the suggestions, however.  here it is:  http://dotfiles.org/
2008-02-09T19:11:00.000Z	grndslm	speart	 i disabled caps lock and remapped it to ctrl instead... i think that's pretty cool

2008-02-09T19:14:00.000Z	speart	grndslm	I want to understand Linux and c, c++, to be able to contribute back
2008-02-09T19:15:00.000Z	grndslm	speart	 then start when an ssh server... try to let your desires lead you from there, mail server, web, mythtv backend, whatever
2008-02-09T19:16:00.000Z	speart	grndslm	how do I optimize ubuntu for a P3?
2008-02-09T19:16:00.000Z	grndslm	speart	 it's done for you already  ubuntu used to have different kernels, but they moved them all to the generic x86 kernel
2008-02-09T19:17:00.000Z	grndslm	speart	 you can recompile your own kernel if you'd like, that's a good learning experience... prepare to mess something up, and beware that it prolly won't give you any noticeable speed increase
2008-02-09T19:17:00.000Z	speart	grndslm	sounds great
