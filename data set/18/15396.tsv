2005-04-02T09:07:00.000Z	dwmcqueen	Dillweed	How do you restart gdm?
2005-04-02T09:08:00.000Z	Dillweed	dwmcqueen	logout.  gdm should have it already in the menu when you logout.
2005-04-02T09:08:00.000Z	dwmcqueen	Dillweed	It doesn;t
2005-04-02T09:09:00.000Z	dwmcqueen		I did logout.
2005-04-02T09:09:00.000Z	Dillweed	dwmcqueen	don't know then try doing a ctrl-alt-backspace.  everytime I've installed xfce the option to change the session to xfce was there.
2005-04-02T09:10:00.000Z	dwmcqueen	Dillweed	I'll try that
