2012-02-13T00:26:00.000Z	{GiGi}		could someone help me out with why can't I connect to the internet with the lastest ubuntu distro?
2012-02-13T00:26:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	{GiGi}	 what have you tried before you came here?
2012-02-13T00:28:00.000Z	{GiGi}	MonkeyDust	I've tried the connection to the router with another device, so that I am 100% certain that works. Then I've tried with the auto DHCP, doesn't work tried with some IPs but I'm not an expert on that field too much. Tried connecting the machine directly to the modem and it was all the same.
2012-02-13T00:29:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	{GiGi}	 wireless or cable?
2012-02-13T00:30:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	{GiGi}	 what's in /etc/network/interfaces ? use pastebin
2012-02-13T00:31:00.000Z	{GiGi}	MonkeyDust	just "auto lo" and "iface lo inet loopback" in the next line.
2012-02-13T00:32:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	{GiGi}	 change loopback to dhcp
2012-02-13T00:35:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	{GiGi}	 zykotick9 sorry! i don't use N-M
2012-02-13T00:39:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	{GiGi}	 do you want to use network manager or modify the network settings manually?
2012-02-13T00:43:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	{GiGi}	 i'm not familiar with network tools, don't see how you can use it to configure your network (if that's what you want)
2012-02-13T00:46:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	{GiGi}	 in that case, start here https://help.ubuntu.com/11.10/ubuntu-help/net-wired.html
2012-02-13T00:48:00.000Z	{GiGi}	MonkeyDust	the thing is, DHCP seems to be working, else my other device that is usually connected with that cable wouldn't be working. I'm just not sure why ubuntu is not getting the requited info from the router
2012-02-13T00:49:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	{GiGi}	 what info is that exactly?
2012-02-13T00:51:00.000Z	{GiGi}	MonkeyDust	well, apparently it doesn't get the right IPs from the router I guess, else it'd be connecting to the internet with no problem. Or an error might be techincal even, I can't say at this point..
2012-02-13T00:52:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	{GiGi}	 you mean the ip addresses are not in the same range as the router's ip address?
2012-02-13T00:53:00.000Z	{GiGi}	MonkeyDust	shouldn't it use the IP it gets from the router?
2012-02-13T00:54:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	{GiGi}	 idd, that's why i'm asking
2012-02-13T00:56:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	{GiGi}	 if does not get *any* info, it sounds like a hardware issue to me
