2010-02-20T09:38:00.000Z	EMABrad		So, I'm installing Eeebuntu on my friend's netbook.  She wants XP Pro on it as well, but doesn't have the CD yet.  She'll have it soon, but wants Eeebuntu now, so I'm partitioning the hard drive using the Eeebuntu installer, which, as far as I know, is the same installer as Ubuntu.  I choose "Specify partitions manually", and have a few questions as to how exactly to set the partitions up.
2010-02-20T09:39:00.000Z	EMABrad		We're wanting to dual boot, but also have a shared partition (probably fat32) that has all of her documents and stuff like that.  We've got all the sizes mapped out, so we don't need help with that.
2010-02-20T09:40:00.000Z	EMABrad		Is fat32 the best format for this partition?
2010-02-20T09:41:00.000Z	EMABrad		Eeebuntu reads NTFS fine?
2010-02-20T09:42:00.000Z	EMABrad		Well, as of right now, her computer isn't operational, and she needs it, but won't have the Windows CD until next weekend, so we figured this was the best option.
2010-02-20T09:43:00.000Z	EMABrad		When I'm selecting the partition to put Eeebuntu on, what format should this be?  Ext3 or Ext4?
2010-02-20T09:44:00.000Z	EMABrad		Also, I figure that the Eeebuntu partition should be "Primary".  Am I right?
2010-02-20T09:45:00.000Z	EMABrad		Should the type for the storage partition be "Logical"?
2010-02-20T09:47:00.000Z	iflema	EMABrad	 ext3 or ext4, both will work.... take ya pick..... doesnt have to be on primary partitions.... the thing there is you only get four primary or three plus logical partitions......
2010-02-20T09:52:00.000Z	iflema	EMABrad	are you going through the installer now?
2010-02-20T09:56:00.000Z	iflema	EMABrad	are you going through the installer now?
2010-02-20T09:57:00.000Z	iflema	EMABrad	if you have made only one partioton... the mount point is /
2010-02-20T10:01:00.000Z	iflema	EMABrad	i suggest installing XP on the first partition...... up front the install ya linux after...... and no the mount point is still /
2010-02-20T10:03:00.000Z	EMABrad	iflema	She doesn't have the XP CD yet, but needs to use the computer now, so I'm sort of forced to start the installation with Eeebuntu.
2010-02-20T10:03:00.000Z	iflema	EMABrad	win xp will complain and youll have to wipe ya linux if there is no naitive window file system on the first partition
2010-02-20T10:04:00.000Z	iflema	EMABrad	just format 10 or 20gig+ or whatever on the first partition.... the format the rest for linux
2010-02-20T10:06:00.000Z	iflema	EMABrad	best not to leave a gap if ya follow me...... just format the first partion big enough and of a native file system type e.g. ntfs.... and use the rest for linux and a partition twice the size of ya ram for swap space
2010-02-20T10:09:00.000Z	EMABrad	iflema	So when XP installs, does it need a partition already made out for it, or can it create a partition out of unallocated space?
