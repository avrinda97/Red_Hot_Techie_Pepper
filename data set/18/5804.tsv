2009-07-06T10:09:00.000Z	mralexandro	scunizi	well it does not auto detect here
2009-07-06T10:09:00.000Z	mralexandro	scunizi	i go back to xchat, this was unusual
2009-07-06T10:09:00.000Z	scunizi	mralexandro	autodetect what?
2009-07-06T10:10:00.000Z	mralexandro	scunizi	5 sec change irc client
2009-07-06T10:11:00.000Z	mralexandro	scunizi	autodetect the mmc memory card. in my card reader. at my dell xps m1330 :)
2009-07-06T10:12:00.000Z	scunizi	mralexandro	that's frustrating.. I've got a dell vostro 1400 with Hardy installed and suddenly it stopped recognizing card inserted into the built in slot.. I haven't found a solution.
2009-07-06T10:13:00.000Z	mralexandro	scunizi	ironaically enough i might know the reason, i doubt it since you havent found a solution. i think i remember that you have to unmount it properly in vista or xp or whateever windows system you have and then boot the linux and it should work. i do not know
2009-07-06T10:14:00.000Z	scunizi	mralexandro	that might be true but it's never been on a win system.. only linux
2009-07-06T10:15:00.000Z	mralexandro	scunizi	oh:/ well i will try and i will let you know:D
2009-07-06T10:15:00.000Z	scunizi	mralexandro	k
