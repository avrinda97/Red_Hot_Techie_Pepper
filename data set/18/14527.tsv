2006-02-25T17:25:00.000Z	ben_underscore		anyone here into postgresql?
2006-02-25T17:26:00.000Z	jimcooncat	ben_underscore	I'm just getting started with postgres
2006-02-25T17:27:00.000Z	ben_underscore	jimcooncat	when using psql, i'm trying to connect using a username, password and server, but it's giving me an access denied. have you cracked this one?
2006-02-25T17:28:00.000Z	jimcooncat	ben_underscore	I always have to go through the docs when making a new connection -- I never remember.
2006-02-25T17:29:00.000Z	ben_underscore	jimcooncat	what are you using it for?
2006-02-25T17:29:00.000Z	jimcooncat	ben_underscore	know that postgres users are not the same as the computer users necessarily
2006-02-25T17:29:00.000Z	ben_underscore	jimcooncat	yeah
2006-02-25T17:30:00.000Z	ben_underscore	jimcooncat	ok, have you found the performance ok?
2006-02-25T17:30:00.000Z	jimcooncat	ben_underscore	performance is fine but watch your memory to make sure you don't start swapping
2006-02-25T17:31:00.000Z	ben_underscore	jimcooncat	yeah, i can imagine that. i'm planning to use it for a spatial data warehouse
2006-02-25T17:31:00.000Z	ben_underscore	jimcooncat	i compiled the postgis extension last night and am now trying to hook mapserver into it
2006-02-25T17:31:00.000Z	jimcooncat	ben_underscore	 are you going to have a lot of users writing to the database?
2006-02-25T17:32:00.000Z	ben_underscore	jimcooncat	no. there will be an extract/transform/load routine in perl once a day but the majority of users will be read only
2006-02-25T17:33:00.000Z	jimcooncat	ben_underscore	I was going to suggest sqlite but didn't realize you were going to use the gis extension
2006-02-25T17:34:00.000Z	ben_underscore	jimcooncat	yeah i want to get the r stats environment running over postgis so i can do some cluster analyses on environmental data
2006-02-25T17:35:00.000Z	jimcooncat	ben_underscore	then you should be fine, I imagine you have plenty of ram if you're trying something like that
2006-02-25T17:35:00.000Z	ben_underscore	jimcooncat	depends how much i can scounge up!
2006-02-25T17:36:00.000Z	jimcooncat	ben_underscore	if you need more speed you could have postgres write static data to disk and have your analysis read from that
