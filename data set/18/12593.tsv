2006-04-06T14:00:00.000Z	ompaul	sphinx	the instructions are there how to recover linux after using that monopolist softwares installer
2006-04-06T14:03:00.000Z	ompaul	sphinx	to allow us help you there please suggest what functionality you want to cover as opposed to MS/other program names one line at a time - if you need to audit it and there are several go to paste.ubuntu-nl.org and come back here with a url and see what can be done for you, you would be surprised
2006-04-06T14:04:00.000Z	sphinx	ompaul	 i need to have ie6 installed on my ubuntu os so i can install the Velaro program
2006-04-06T14:04:00.000Z	ompaul	sphinx	let me look at this velaro
2006-04-06T14:10:00.000Z	sphinx	ompaul	can u please present some assistance on this matter ( Installing ie6 on ubuntu )
2006-04-06T14:13:00.000Z	ompaul	sphinx	no I can't do that, other than to say read wine docs - I know nothing of that, the help I was thinking of and am of a mind about is that is a chat session setup to talk to users fired by a click on a web site so the middleware is actually faulty by causing dependence, wine is >>sudo apt-get install xwine<< on the command line ->> winesetuptk <<- may also be useful to you
2006-04-06T14:14:00.000Z	sphinx	ompaul	 hrm then umm i need winesetuptk for what use ?
2006-04-06T14:14:00.000Z	ompaul	sphinx	if new machines I have have that o/s they get wiped, and from there I go forward with an operating system
2006-04-06T14:15:00.000Z	ompaul	sphinx	are you useing command line?
2006-04-06T14:15:00.000Z	ompaul	sphinx	I choose it at random after seeing the output of this: apt-cache search wine
2006-04-06T14:16:00.000Z	ompaul	sphinx	to install them do this >>sudo apt-get install PROGRAM<<
2006-04-06T14:17:00.000Z	ompaul	sphinx	I don't know, I have to treat all people the same after all, what I see is irc - so make it easy for all - hard and it is no use :-) I could do some abstract natter or say rtfm but as you know that is no use
2006-04-06T14:18:00.000Z	ompaul	sphinx	well some say that :)
2006-04-06T14:19:00.000Z	ompaul	sphinx	if all thought like that we would have an easy life - the one that most dont get is !patience :-) that one freaks most win users out howver this would be better in #ubuntu-offtopic but I have to go and move my Saturday along *fast*
2006-04-06T14:20:00.000Z	ompaul	sphinx	it is 9:20am
2006-04-15T15:46:00.000Z	ompaul	sphinx	read wiki.ubuntu.coim/RootSudo
