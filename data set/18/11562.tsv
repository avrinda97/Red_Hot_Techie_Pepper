2006-07-18T13:02:00.000Z	Shinzetsu		Is it possible to install Ubuntu on an USB HDD?
2006-07-18T13:03:00.000Z	Warbo	Shinzetsu	I am running from a USB HD
2006-07-18T13:03:00.000Z	Warbo	Shinzetsu	Does your PC support booting from USB? If not then you will need a boot CD
2006-07-18T13:05:00.000Z	Warbo	Shinzetsu	I have actually installed to USB HD perfectly well before, but when I upgraded to Dapper I just copied across all of the files from a regular installation. Both ways worked (but I needed to find out how to make a boot CD, then wrote it up on the Wiki)
2006-07-19T08:44:00.000Z	Warbo	Shinzetsu	Choose your session at the login screen
2006-07-19T08:44:00.000Z	Warbo	Shinzetsu	You chose KDE, right?
2006-07-19T08:44:00.000Z	Warbo	Shinzetsu	What happens if you run "startkde"?
2006-07-19T08:45:00.000Z	Warbo	Shinzetsu	Yeah, I'm just wondering if you somehow overwrote KDE binaries with GNOM ones.....
2006-07-19T08:46:00.000Z	Warbo	Shinzetsu	That should be run when you choose KDE in the session thingie. I wonder why it didn't work automatically?
2006-07-19T08:48:00.000Z	Warbo	Shinzetsu	Try getting rid of GNOME, or at least GDM
2006-08-01T13:25:00.000Z	Warbo	Shinzetsu	ctrl-alt-F1
2006-08-01T13:25:00.000Z	Warbo	Shinzetsu	To turn it off you can run "sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop"
2006-08-01T13:45:00.000Z	Shinzetsu	Warbo	look in /usr/etc/
2006-08-01T13:46:00.000Z	Warbo	Shinzetsu	What? I have no /usr/etc
2006-08-01T13:46:00.000Z	Shinzetsu	Warbo	sorry cant help you thenb
2006-08-07T14:11:00.000Z	Warbo	Shinzetsu	Did you unmount the drive properly?
2006-08-07T14:11:00.000Z	Shinzetsu	Warbo	I just copy and unplug it
2006-08-07T14:12:00.000Z	Warbo	Shinzetsu	You need to unmount, or some filesystem changes won't get written (writing EVERYTHING to disk will reduce the lifetime of a flash drive)
