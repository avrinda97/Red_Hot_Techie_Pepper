2007-05-10T14:10:00.000Z	H264	Nanu	what is it formatted as?
2007-05-10T14:11:00.000Z	H264	Nanu	:/
2007-05-10T14:11:00.000Z	Nanu	H264	maybe i matter of permissions
2007-05-10T14:13:00.000Z	H264	Nanu	well... perhaps, but I don't know if Ubuntu can write to NTFS, the problem is that Microsoft owns and keeps to its self the writing portion of NTFS
2007-05-10T14:13:00.000Z	Nanu	H264	well ,, fuck Microsoft
2007-05-10T14:14:00.000Z	H264	Nanu	even if you could write to it after a while it might not work
2007-05-10T14:14:00.000Z	H264	Nanu	somewhere I read something about that happening
2007-05-10T14:15:00.000Z	Nanu	H264	can i format it?
2007-05-10T14:15:00.000Z	H264	Nanu	you dual boot?
2007-05-10T14:16:00.000Z	H264	Nanu	or is that just an extra storage disk for windows?
2007-05-10T14:17:00.000Z	Nanu	H264	it is a desk on a box with USB cable connected to the USB port in my motherboard
2007-05-10T14:18:00.000Z	H264	Nanu	ok, you use it for extra storage only?
2007-05-10T14:18:00.000Z	Nanu	H264	yes
2007-05-10T14:18:00.000Z	H264	Nanu	Great :)
2007-05-10T14:19:00.000Z	H264	Nanu	Linux (and everything else for that matter) works quite well with FAT32, which is what I would format it as...
2007-05-10T14:20:00.000Z	H264	Nanu	which OS are you using that it is plugged into?
2007-05-10T14:21:00.000Z	Nanu	H264	I gotta go
2007-05-10T14:21:00.000Z	H264	Nanu	ok cy :)
