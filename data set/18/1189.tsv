2011-05-03T05:12:00.000Z	DasEi	beanstalk	sudo update-manager -d  tells ?
2011-05-03T05:12:00.000Z	beanstalk	DasEi	let me see
2011-05-03T05:12:00.000Z	beanstalk	DasEi	that's just the normal update manager
2011-05-03T05:13:00.000Z	beanstalk	DasEi	I know how to upgrade
2011-05-03T05:14:00.000Z	DasEi	beanstalk	which version it suggests ? natty (11.04) or even further ?
2011-05-03T05:16:00.000Z	beanstalk	DasEi	that was to you :P
2011-05-03T05:18:00.000Z	DasEi	beanstalk	either can set the update-manager to prompt for new releases or go by http://paste.ubuntu.com/602553/ as mentioned above
2011-05-03T05:19:00.000Z	beanstalk	DasEi	zvacet: I've already set it to do that. I pressed the button to upgrade to 10.10. That's what's giving me "E:Error, pkgProblemResolver::Resolve generated breaks."
2011-05-03T05:21:00.000Z	DasEi	beanstalk	is your system updated/graded ?
2011-05-03T05:22:00.000Z	beanstalk	DasEi	yes. I've installed all the latest updates.
2011-05-03T05:22:00.000Z	DasEi	beanstalk	sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
2011-05-03T05:22:00.000Z	beanstalk	DasEi	I'll try
2011-05-03T05:30:00.000Z	DasEi	beanstalk	never heard of that error, try from single mode, repair broken packages, if that doesn't help, choose another server
2011-05-03T05:31:00.000Z	beanstalk	DasEi	what's single mode? I've already repaired broken packages. and how do I choose another server? :P
2011-05-03T05:31:00.000Z	DasEi	beanstalk	single-mode is tried ? sudo synaptic > sources > choose downloadserver
