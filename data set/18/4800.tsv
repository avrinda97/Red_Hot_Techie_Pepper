2009-08-18T00:59:00.000Z	MariaKeys		gentlemen, is there anyone running a system here without internationalization support?
2009-08-18T01:00:00.000Z	MariaKeys		i like to remove internationalization support from glibc
2009-08-18T01:00:00.000Z	hbekel	MariaKeys	why?
2009-08-18T01:01:00.000Z	MariaKeys	ikonia	yes, --disable-nls
2009-08-18T01:01:00.000Z	MariaKeys	ikonia	I want to know actually if there is anyone who is running a server without this internationalization virus.
2009-08-18T01:02:00.000Z	hbekel	MariaKeys	yawn
2009-08-18T01:02:00.000Z	MariaKeys	ikonia	why do i need it on my server?
2009-08-18T01:02:00.000Z	MariaKeys	ikonia	more importantly, why does anyone need internationalization ona server?
2009-08-18T01:02:00.000Z	hbekel	MariaKeys	how does it hurt to have it there?
2009-08-18T01:03:00.000Z	MariaKeys	ikonia	it is 300MB at /usr/share/locale. It is not small.
2009-08-18T01:03:00.000Z	MariaKeys	ikonia	removing it does not remove it from binaries.
2009-08-18T01:03:00.000Z	hbekel	MariaKeys	feel free to remove what you don't need, then
2009-08-18T01:04:00.000Z	MariaKeys	ikonia	thanks but you did not answer. why does anyone need internationalization on a server?
2009-08-18T01:04:00.000Z	MariaKeys	ikonia	many distros... ubuntu being one of them.
2009-08-18T01:07:00.000Z	MariaKeys	ikonia	alright whatever. any idea about CONFIG_NLS kernel option?
2009-08-18T01:08:00.000Z	hbekel	MariaKeys	clear case of rtfm
2009-08-18T01:08:00.000Z	MariaKeys	ikonia	i know what it is. anyone using it?
2009-08-18T01:08:00.000Z	hbekel	MariaKeys	and that means "fine" as i assume you know
