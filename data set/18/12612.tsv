2006-12-24T08:13:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp		How do I change the "message of the day" that appears when you login to a user on the command line? I edited /etc/motd but this doesn't appear to be persistent after a reboot.
2006-12-24T08:15:00.000Z	POVaddct	Lunar_Lamp	i think /etc/motd is autogenerated by the /etc/init.d/bootmisc.sh init script
2006-12-24T08:15:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp	POVaddct	ok, thanks - I;ll look into changing that then :-)
2006-12-24T08:15:00.000Z	POVaddct	Lunar_Lamp	look for something like EDIT_MOTD
2006-12-24T08:18:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp	POVaddct	the appropriate lines are: http://www.pastebin.it/index.php?id=2595
2006-12-24T08:18:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp	POVaddct	that would indicate that I should edit /etc/motd.tail with my new message?
2006-12-24T08:19:00.000Z	POVaddct	Lunar_Lamp	yeah
2006-12-24T08:19:00.000Z	POVaddct	Lunar_Lamp	are you using edgy?
2006-12-24T08:21:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp	POVaddct	yes - edgy server edition (the box in question)
2006-12-24T08:22:00.000Z	POVaddct	Lunar_Lamp	then in edgy they changed the location of the motd file. i think is used to be /etc/motd, now it seems its /var/run/motd
2006-12-24T08:25:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp	POVaddct	oh, I thought /var/run was a weird dir that was auto-generated. I'm not that expert in booting stuff :-) Thanks for the pointer!
2006-12-24T08:25:00.000Z	POVaddct	Lunar_Lamp	/var/run is auto-generated
2006-12-24T08:26:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp	POVaddct	so how can I edit /var/run then? It won't be persistent after a reboot!
2006-12-24T08:26:00.000Z	POVaddct	Lunar_Lamp	no, you edit /etc/motd.tail, it gets appended to the generated file in /var/run at each boot
2006-12-24T08:27:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp		Oh, so I can't remove the default stuff about ubuntu then?
2006-12-24T08:27:00.000Z	POVaddct	Lunar_Lamp	yes, looks like that
2006-12-24T08:28:00.000Z	POVaddct	Lunar_Lamp	of course you could modify the bootmisc.sh script, but that wouldnt be "clean"
2006-12-24T08:29:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp	POVaddct	yeah, I know what you mean, it doesn't feel right to do it that way :-)
