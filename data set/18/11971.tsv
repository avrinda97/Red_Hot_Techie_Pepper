2006-06-03T10:31:00.000Z	TigerWolf	Centaur5	i had networking problems on my pc - multiple network cards? is it dual boot? running off a router?
2006-06-03T10:32:00.000Z	Centaur5	TigerWolf	Well it's a laptop so it has a built in modem, ethernet, and wireless but I only enable one at a time.  It's not dual booting and it is going through a router.
2006-06-03T10:33:00.000Z	TigerWolf	Centaur5	The problem i had was with the way my router assigned ips - i had a static one setup. Not sure i can help though its a bit different
2006-06-03T10:33:00.000Z	TigerWolf		hello Samb1
2006-06-03T10:34:00.000Z	TigerWolf		it was my first time in here today too - im absolutelty loving ubuntu
2006-06-03T10:34:00.000Z	TigerWolf		Heh - isnt it great
2006-06-03T10:34:00.000Z	Centaur5	TigerWolf	Well when I tried it on a different wireless connection without encryption it locked up just when I was typing in the essid so I wasn't even activating it.
2006-06-03T10:35:00.000Z	TigerWolf	Centaur5	Ive heard other people complain about the wireless drivers - you might have to scrouge some forums to find a fix
2006-06-03T10:35:00.000Z	TigerWolf	Centaur5	No possible way to wire it up without wireless for the time being?
2006-06-03T10:35:00.000Z	Centaur5	TigerWolf	Yes, it hangs on ethernet as well
2006-06-03T10:36:00.000Z	TigerWolf	Centaur5	Using live CD?
2006-06-03T10:36:00.000Z	Centaur5	TigerWolf	I tried activating it manually via terminal and with the network manager
2006-06-03T10:36:00.000Z	Centaur5	TigerWolf	Oh, I only tried wireless with the live cd because of where I was.  I guess I can try the live cd with ethernet
2006-06-03T10:37:00.000Z	TigerWolf	Centaur5	My ethernet worked with live - but when i booted in it screwed up - i had to change some settings and stuff - only real problem ive had - sorry nothing else i can help you with :(
2006-06-03T10:38:00.000Z	Centaur5	TigerWolf	What kind of stuff did you have to change?
2006-06-03T10:41:00.000Z	TigerWolf	Centaur5	Well i had the convinience of two network cards, one worked other didnt. Had to restart the router so it gave me new DHCP and refreshed in ubuntu. I also played round with the setting for the DNS server. Finnaly got it to work after diabling and then enabling
2006-06-03T10:42:00.000Z	TigerWolf		Anyone got XGL to work?
2006-06-03T10:43:00.000Z	Centaur5	TigerWolf	Alright, well it sounds like I might have to backup everything and downgrade to Breezy
