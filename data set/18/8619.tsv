2007-07-22T11:27:00.000Z	mcantor		Hey guys.  I just fresh-installed Kubuntu and for some reason, when I type :help in vim, it says "No tags file" "Sorry, no help for help.txt".  Whawt gives?
2007-07-22T11:28:00.000Z	ormandj	mcantor	sudo apt-get install vim-full
2007-07-22T11:30:00.000Z	mcantor	ormandj	Is there a KDE equivalent of that, or will KDE just play nice with vim-full?
2007-07-22T11:31:00.000Z	ormandj	mcantor	there are no vim UIs not written in gtk. you don't need vim-full, i installed it and never use the GUI version
2007-07-22T11:31:00.000Z	mcantor	ormandj	You mean, there are no Vim UIs written in Qt?
2007-07-22T11:33:00.000Z	ormandj	mcantor	really, why?? :)
2007-07-22T11:33:00.000Z	mcantor	ormandj	Why what?
2007-07-22T11:34:00.000Z	mcantor	ormandj	BTW, installing vim-full worked like a dream.
2007-07-22T11:34:00.000Z	ormandj	mcantor	they are pointless, they just slow the workflow down
2007-07-22T11:35:00.000Z	mcantor	ormandj	I've been using Vim for 5 years, dude.  Trust me, I know
2007-07-22T11:35:00.000Z	mcantor	ormandj	I just wanted the help files
2007-07-22T11:35:00.000Z	mcantor	ormandj	I'm not entirely sure how I got sidetracked into the GUI discussion
2007-07-22T11:35:00.000Z	ormandj	mcantor	so avoid those nasty UIs! :p yeah. i had the same issue, that's why i suggested vim-full. it does the gnome UI crap but just don't use it
2007-07-22T11:35:00.000Z	ormandj	mcantor	i wish there was a vim-full-nogui package ;)
2007-07-22T11:36:00.000Z	mcantor	ormandj	That would be pretty awesome
2007-07-22T11:37:00.000Z	ormandj	mcantor	looks like "sudo apt-get install vim vim-common" might do the trick minus the GUI stuff
2007-07-22T11:37:00.000Z	mcantor	ormandj	hmmm, well, I already have vim-full
2007-07-22T11:38:00.000Z	ormandj	mcantor	yeah, same here, just saying if you really want to get rid of vim-full and the gui related packages, you could go that route. personally, i'd just leave it as is :p
