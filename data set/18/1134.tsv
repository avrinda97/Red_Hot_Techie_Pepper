2011-05-30T01:38:00.000Z	nit-wit	eb3ha4el	the flash aid add on will get you the latest adobe and clean out unneeded stuff including  the installer.
2011-05-30T01:35:00.000Z	nit-wit	eb3ha4el	install the firefox addon flash aid and run it.  How much ram does that unit hne?
2011-05-30T01:36:00.000Z	eb3ha4el	nit-wit	HEy~ well I don't think it's RAM problem, since Gnonme system monitor tells me I've got plenty (900MB max, and about 300MB is being used)
2011-05-30T01:38:00.000Z	eb3ha4el	nit-wit	I'll try it thanks
2011-05-30T01:58:00.000Z	eb3ha4el	nit-wit	I tried it, I'm not sure whether it got any faster... I was actually more wondering about if the speed i get from this processer is normal. More about general performance of it and youtube watching thing as example.
