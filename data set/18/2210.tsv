2010-07-22T08:44:00.000Z	Festicle		anyone know how to change the resolution of the virtual terminals?
2010-07-22T08:45:00.000Z	peepingtom	Festicle	do you run proprietary drivers?
2010-07-22T08:45:00.000Z	Festicle	peepingtom	yes nvidia
2010-07-22T08:46:00.000Z	peepingtom	Festicle	because the open source drivers are better that way, they use "kernel mode setting"
2010-07-22T08:46:00.000Z	peepingtom	Festicle	if you really care (and it's not super easy) google around for "framebuffer" "VT" "resolution"
2010-07-22T08:47:00.000Z	Festicle	peepingtom	ok thanks, i tried googling stuff but i was getting no where, now that I have some key words it should help. thanks
2010-07-22T08:48:00.000Z	peepingtom	Festicle	it's more complicated with widescreen.
2010-07-22T08:49:00.000Z	Festicle	peepingtom	yeah.. i have 720p
2010-07-22T09:17:00.000Z	Festicle	peepingtom	i got the resolution changed on the virtual terminals. thanks you so much for the help
2010-07-22T09:18:00.000Z	peepingtom	Festicle	can you give me a link? Id like to do it too :D
2010-07-22T09:18:00.000Z	Festicle	peepingtom	it was the link you provided
2010-07-22T09:18:00.000Z	Festicle	peepingtom	install hwinfo and run sudo hwinfo --framebuffer
2010-07-22T09:21:00.000Z	peepingtom	Festicle	to do it permanently I think you can edit /etc/default/grub and then run update-grub as root
2010-07-22T09:22:00.000Z	Festicle	peepingtom	sweet thats what i was looking up now. at least i know I can get a nice looking terminal on my netbook lol
2010-07-22T09:24:00.000Z	peepingtom	Festicle	"text" works as a boot option
2010-07-22T09:24:00.000Z	peepingtom	Festicle	did you actually get 16:9 resolutions? mine are all 4:3
2010-07-22T09:26:00.000Z	Festicle	peepingtom	no  i had to resort to 1024x768
2010-07-22T09:26:00.000Z	Festicle	peepingtom	not perfect but much better than what i had going
