2005-10-05T15:33:00.000Z	Knelix	shad0w1e	On Breezy??!
2005-10-05T15:33:00.000Z	shad0w1e	Knelix	yes!
2005-10-05T15:33:00.000Z	Knelix	shad0w1e	:-)
2005-10-05T15:33:00.000Z	Knelix	shad0w1e	HOW?!
2005-10-05T15:38:00.000Z	Knelix	shad0w1e	You have to tell me how you intstalled the NVIDIA driver.. was it Ubuntu's own or NVIDIA's?
2005-10-05T15:42:00.000Z	Knelix	shad0w1e	I just downloaded 5.04 and am deciding whether to install it or Breezy, mainly based on if I can fully use my video card... I'd really appreciate it if you could tell me how you got to install the driver in Breezy...
2005-10-05T15:43:00.000Z	shad0w1e	Knelix	it works fine on hoary
2005-10-05T15:44:00.000Z	Knelix	shad0w1e	Ah.. that's the main reason I'm thinking of downgrading to Hoary.
2005-10-05T15:45:00.000Z	Knelix	shad0w1e	When you wipe the drive and install Hoary via the CD you can...
2005-10-05T15:45:00.000Z	shad0w1e	Knelix	lol
2005-10-05T15:45:00.000Z	Knelix	shad0w1e	:-P
2005-10-05T15:45:00.000Z	shad0w1e	Knelix	the "nv" driver def. works
2005-10-05T15:45:00.000Z	Knelix	shad0w1e	Exactly. Useless. I can't even get the 3d screen savers to work.
2005-10-05T15:46:00.000Z	shad0w1e	Knelix	I'm thinking once Breezy becomes stable (few weeks) this problem will sort itself out?
2005-10-05T15:46:00.000Z	Knelix	shad0w1e	I was trying to explain to my non-tech savvy cousin why I couldn't get 3d to work and he just gave me this strange look... it just looks bad...
2005-10-05T15:46:00.000Z	Knelix	shad0w1e	Exactly. And then I shall upgrade.
2005-10-05T15:46:00.000Z	shad0w1e	Knelix	first off you need to download the drivers
