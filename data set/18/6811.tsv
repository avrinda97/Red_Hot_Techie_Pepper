2008-04-11T13:41:00.000Z	pat5star		Steve: no matter how clever you try to appear, it's not working
2008-04-11T13:41:00.000Z	pat5star		Steve: no, the /sn/s/sns//sn/s///sn/..ss    stuff
2008-04-11T13:42:00.000Z	pat5star		lol
2008-04-11T13:43:00.000Z	pat5star		then everything will work
2008-04-11T13:44:00.000Z	pat5star		what was wrong with my advice?
2008-04-11T13:44:00.000Z	pat5star		that's what I did with my install, I have no problems
2008-04-11T13:45:00.000Z	pat5star		kicked? I can't believe that! I'm trying to help and being threatened with being kicked....that's the thanks I get?
2008-04-11T13:47:00.000Z	pat5star		not
2008-04-11T13:47:00.000Z	pat5star		I mean
2008-04-11T13:47:00.000Z	Chousuke	pat5star	no, it wouldn't.
2008-04-11T13:47:00.000Z	Chousuke	pat5star	it would've broken his system.
2008-04-11T13:48:00.000Z	Chousuke	pat5star	no, it wouldn't.
2008-04-11T13:49:00.000Z	pat5star	Chousuke	that command you just typed wouldn't work, you have to assign an owner like chmod -R root:root /, then it will work, that' syour problem
2008-04-11T13:51:00.000Z	Chousuke	pat5star	your command wouldn't work
2008-04-11T13:51:00.000Z	Chousuke	pat5star	you don't change users with chmod
2008-04-11T13:51:00.000Z	Chousuke	pat5star	and I *intended* for my command not to work because "chmod -R /"  with any permission string will mess up your system
2008-04-11T13:53:00.000Z	Chousuke	pat5star	... no
