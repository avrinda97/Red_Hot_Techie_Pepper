2009-08-26T01:25:00.000Z	Akram		I have a problem with iconv
2009-08-26T01:25:00.000Z	Akram		it keeps giving "iconv: illegal input sequence at position"
2009-08-26T01:26:00.000Z	Akram		help please
2009-08-26T01:26:00.000Z	Akram		iconv help please?
2009-08-26T01:27:00.000Z	Akram		 iconv -f utf8 -t ascii//TRANSLIT file.txt
2009-08-26T01:28:00.000Z	Akram		it stops from the point it encounters accented character
2009-08-26T01:28:00.000Z	thingy	Akram	are you sure the file TANSLIT is a proper utf8 file?
2009-08-26T01:28:00.000Z	thingy	Akram	can you see the bom character sequence at the start of the file?
2009-08-26T01:29:00.000Z	thingy	Akram	whats the output of "file TRANSLIT"
2009-08-26T01:29:00.000Z	thingy	Akram	well there you go
2009-08-26T01:30:00.000Z	thingy	Akram	let me read the iconv man page...to understand what your command line does...paste it again please
2009-08-26T01:31:00.000Z	thingy	Akram	so your telling iconv that your inputfile "file.txt" is utf8 and you want to conver that into ASCII?
2009-08-26T01:31:00.000Z	thingy	Akram	also, paste the output of "file file.txt"
2009-08-26T01:33:00.000Z	thingy	Akram	"file file.txt"
2009-08-26T01:34:00.000Z	Akram	thingy	it is file.txt: ISO-8859 text
2009-08-26T01:34:00.000Z	thingy	Akram	so why are you telling iconv that its utf8 ?
2009-08-26T01:34:00.000Z	thingy	Akram	no
