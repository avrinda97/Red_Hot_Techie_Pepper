2005-10-10T15:48:00.000Z	Quinthius	Cryptid	is it a source code archive?
2005-10-10T15:48:00.000Z	Quinthius	Cryptid	for most source code archives, that is the general order of things. but for make install you'll probably need to use sudo
2005-10-10T15:49:00.000Z	Quinthius	Cryptid	also, there should be a README or INSTALL file (or both) that you should read...
2005-10-10T15:51:00.000Z	Cryptid	Quinthius	should i read the install-sh file
2005-10-10T15:51:00.000Z	Quinthius	Cryptid	umm i don't know. read INSTALL and README and they should explain what to do..
2005-10-10T15:51:00.000Z	Quinthius	Cryptid	or the website for whatever it is you're installing
2005-10-10T15:52:00.000Z	Cryptid	Quinthius	no the readme file on decribes the program and there is no install file there is only install-sh and the website dosent have a guide to installation
2005-10-10T15:53:00.000Z	Quinthius	Cryptid	install-sh sounds like a script to install or something. there must be installation instructions somewhere... is there a doc folder or anything?
2005-10-10T15:59:00.000Z	Quinthius	Cryptid	tar -jxf blah.tar.bz2
2005-10-11T16:00:00.000Z	Quinthius	Cryptid	and don't spam here
