2010-02-28T08:03:00.000Z	Iceman_B		I just upgraded to Ubuntu 9.10, but I still cant put my desktop to 1440x900 reso to fit my monitor. Itś stuck on 1024x768, and im using the Nvidia drivers
2010-02-28T08:03:00.000Z	Iceman_B		how to fix this?
2010-02-28T08:03:00.000Z	Izinucs	Iceman_B	you might try nvidia-xconfig or nvidia-settings
2010-02-28T08:04:00.000Z	Iceman_B	Izinucs	nvidia-xconfig returns errors, trying -settings now...
2010-02-28T08:05:00.000Z	Izinucs	Iceman_B	have you activated the nvidia drivers?
2010-02-28T08:05:00.000Z	Iceman_B	Izinucs	yes, I have. and the widget that comes up says CRT-1, and I cant change anything. changing the reso only makes the desktop larger
2010-02-28T08:06:00.000Z	Izinucs	Iceman_B	you hooked to a tv/monitor?
2010-02-28T08:06:00.000Z	Iceman_B	Izinucs	 nope, Acer AL1916W lcd widescreen
2010-02-28T08:07:00.000Z	Izinucs	Iceman_B	which driver and what card do you have?
2010-02-28T08:07:00.000Z	Iceman_B	Izinucs	Nvidia driver 185.18.36, gfx card is a GF6800 LE
2010-02-28T08:08:00.000Z	Izinucs	Iceman_B	is there a 173 driver also available?
2010-02-28T08:09:00.000Z	Iceman_B	Izinucs	yeah. I can choose between 173, 185(now actvd), and 96
2010-02-28T08:10:00.000Z	Izinucs	Iceman_B	try the 173 and see what happens.. also in cli type xrandr and see if the resolution that you want comes up.. if it doesn't then you'll have to add the resolution to xrandr to make it work.
2010-02-28T08:10:00.000Z	Iceman_B	Izinucs	okay, Iĺl try both tips
2010-02-28T08:10:00.000Z	Izinucs	Iceman_B	do the 2nd first
2010-02-28T08:11:00.000Z	Iceman_B	Izinucs	1440x900       63.0  <-- that comes up in the last line
2010-02-28T08:11:00.000Z	Izinucs	Iceman_B	I've forgotten.. is that what you want?
2010-02-28T08:12:00.000Z	Izinucs	Iceman_B	I'll have ubottu send you a link .. it might help.
