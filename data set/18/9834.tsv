2009-09-15T23:25:00.000Z	Len		Why cant my ubuntu can't find other computer's from my LAN by name just like Windows?
2009-09-15T23:25:00.000Z	Flare183	Len	Because you don't have samba installed.
2009-09-15T23:26:00.000Z	Len	Flare183	I have it installed
2009-09-15T23:26:00.000Z	Flare183	Len	Then you must configure it for it to work.
2009-09-15T23:26:00.000Z	Len	Flare183	what I need to do?
2009-09-15T23:27:00.000Z	Len	Flare183	what I need to do to configure my samba correctly
2009-09-15T23:30:00.000Z	Len	Flare183	I can mount remote folders and share files using samba here on my ubuntu, but when I ping <some computer> I get an error message saying that host is unkown
2009-09-15T23:31:00.000Z	Len	Flare183	but the ping works for IP, just don't work for names
2009-09-15T23:31:00.000Z	Flare183	Len	That's because samba doesn't like using "names".
2009-09-15T23:33:00.000Z	Len	Flare183	Why? it's more simple to use name than IP even because the IP comes from DHCP and name it's static.
2009-09-15T23:33:00.000Z	Flare183	Len	I have no idea, that's up to the programmers.
2009-09-15T23:35:00.000Z	Len	Flare183	lol, indeed. Do you think that if I install a DNS server here like BIND would solve this problem?
2009-09-15T23:35:00.000Z	Len	Flare183	the network Im trying to use wont have Internet Connection.
2009-09-15T23:35:00.000Z	Flare183	Len	Maybe, or you could just setup a static route on your Router.
2009-09-15T23:37:00.000Z	Len	Flare183	I have some guests computers that may plug into this network, and I'd like just to type their name and find. Don't want to go fiding its ip
2009-09-15T23:39:00.000Z	Flare183	Len	Sorry. But that's the only way to do it, unless they are all on a wired connection in the same workgroup.
2009-09-15T23:40:00.000Z	Len	Flare183	Ok, in anycase i'll try to install bind. Thx
2009-09-15T23:40:00.000Z	Flare183	Len	No problem.
