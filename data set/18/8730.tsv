2007-07-05T14:14:00.000Z	Beriant		ilikec0ws,ok i got the password sorted out,but im following the steps on that webpage and none are working
2007-07-05T14:15:00.000Z	Beriant		ilikec0ws,i tried the one that does not install it from the livecd and the one using the live cd..the livecd way says it works but when i restart it dosnt load up
2007-07-05T14:16:00.000Z	Beriant		ilikec0ws,and without the livecd....well i did the steps and the last line in the command says sudo ./grub well...that does nothing
2007-07-05T14:16:00.000Z	Beriant		ilikec0ws,and i tried just "grub' and it took me to the setup menu for grub,but i dont know what to do from there.
2007-07-05T14:17:00.000Z	Beriant		aeudian,i think mine did the same thing,i just ran it in safe graphical mode,then hit the install icon on the desktop and then restarted it without the cd and it worked fine
2007-07-05T14:19:00.000Z	Beriant		aeudian,ahh im not sure then,i dont know to much about it just know that the first time i tried to install i got a messed up screen,so re tried in safe graph mode and installed it and then it worked fine.

2007-07-05T14:22:00.000Z	powergoal	Beriant	what do you want to do?
2007-07-05T14:23:00.000Z	powergoal	Beriant	were you using grub or lilo?
2007-07-05T14:24:00.000Z	powergoal	Beriant	when you install windows, it overwrites the MBR ( i think... ) so what you have to do is rerun the grub installer.  In order to do this, I have always used the gentoo install disk, because the gentoo docs have really good documentation on chrootin ginto your environment and then how to install the grub loader.
2007-07-05T14:25:00.000Z	powergoal	Beriant	let me find you a link..
2007-07-05T14:25:00.000Z	powergoal	Beriant	its somewhere on the gentoo.org site...

2007-07-05T14:41:00.000Z	powergoal	Beriant	I have looked to see if its compatible with cedega?
2007-07-05T14:42:00.000Z	powergoal	Beriant	if you look on the wiki for cedega, it will tell you how well it works ,if at all.  and from there some pointers on getting it running :)
