2009-12-24T04:09:00.000Z	tsoporan1		Hello, I have this strange problem ... don't know if anyone else has had it, but whenever I try to open a secondary hard drive attached to my computer via Places or double clicking the desktop drive all my desktop icons dissapear. Trying to access it again after that from Places doesn't respond, it looks like its loading but nothing happens. Any ideas? I know thi is pretty vague ...
2009-12-24T04:11:00.000Z	cellofellow	tsoporan1	looks like nautilus is crashing
2009-12-24T04:11:00.000Z	cellofellow	tsoporan1	what kind of drive is it?
2009-12-24T04:11:00.000Z	tsoporan1	cellofellow	its a hard drive ... or did you mean brand?
2009-12-24T04:12:00.000Z	cellofellow	tsoporan1	is it an internal drive or a USB drive? What format is it?
2009-12-24T04:12:00.000Z	tsoporan1	cellofellow	Its a Western Digital 1TB drive, internal, EXT4
2009-12-24T04:13:00.000Z	cellofellow	tsoporan1	probably better to mount it with /etc/fstab than with the gnome volume manager.
2009-12-24T04:13:00.000Z	tsoporan1	cellofellow	it is mounted by fstab
2009-12-24T04:13:00.000Z	cellofellow	tsoporan1	oh
2009-12-24T04:13:00.000Z	tsoporan1	cellofellow	my entry is: /dev/sdb1 /media/Secondary ext4 defaults 0 2  -- I think that is right? It's been a while.
2009-12-24T04:14:00.000Z	cellofellow	tsoporan1	you could run nautilus from the command line (first kill it with pkill) .
2009-12-24T04:14:00.000Z	cellofellow	tsoporan1	your fstab is good, nautilus is being a bother though.
2009-12-24T04:14:00.000Z	tsoporan1	cellofellow	opening it from nautilus just prints out "Segmentation Fault"
2009-12-24T04:15:00.000Z	cellofellow	tsoporan1	installed any nautilus extensions lately?
2009-12-24T04:17:00.000Z	cellofellow	tsoporan1	that's not good, though I'm not sure what that extension does mine loads it just fine.
2009-12-24T04:19:00.000Z	tsoporan1	cellofellow	I found a fix, which worked.
2009-12-24T04:19:00.000Z	cellofellow	tsoporan1	oh, good
