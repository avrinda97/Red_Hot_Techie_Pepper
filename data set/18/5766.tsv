2008-08-24T10:31:00.000Z	cpx		Firefox is crashing on any page that uses Java for some reason... I do not receive any errors or anything
2008-08-24T10:31:00.000Z	ShutterBC	cpx	what java runtime do you have?
2008-08-24T10:31:00.000Z	cpx	ShutterBC	How can I tell?
2008-08-24T10:31:00.000Z	cpx	ShutterBC	It's probably the latest, anyways.
2008-08-24T10:32:00.000Z	ShutterBC	cpx	java -v
2008-08-24T10:32:00.000Z	ShutterBC		or... in Firefox browse to about:plugins
2008-08-24T10:32:00.000Z	cpx	ShutterBC	Unrecognized option: -v
2008-08-24T10:32:00.000Z	cpx		Could not create the Java virtual machine.

2008-08-24T10:34:00.000Z	cpx	ShutterBC	That's cool. Thanks anyways.
2008-08-24T10:34:00.000Z	cpx		So anyone else know why firefox crashes whenever a page uses Java?
2008-08-24T10:34:00.000Z	ShutterBC	cpx	anyway, check /var/log/messages for any errors
2008-08-24T10:35:00.000Z	ShutterBC	cpx	and this sounds like something that could happen to any number of people -- Java + Firefox is pretty popular, after all.  Anything in ubuntuforums on this?
2008-08-24T10:35:00.000Z	cpx	ShutterBC	Seems whenever ff crashes, this appears:
