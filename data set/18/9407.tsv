2007-04-13T16:04:00.000Z	Mr_Giraffe		i'm getting a weird error every time i try to run nautilus as root
2007-04-13T16:04:00.000Z	Mr_Giraffe		can i paste it in here?
2007-04-13T16:05:00.000Z	Mr_Giraffe		gotcha.
2007-04-13T16:07:00.000Z	Mr_Giraffe		good point
2007-04-13T16:07:00.000Z	Mr_Giraffe		well all i want to do is install some fonts, and it won't let me unless i use nautilus as root :[
2007-04-13T16:08:00.000Z	Mr_Giraffe		...really?
2007-04-13T16:08:00.000Z	Mr_Giraffe		i thought i had to use fonts:///
2007-04-13T16:09:00.000Z	bokey	Mr_Giraffe	you can either do that or then copy the fonts to ~/.fonts and then run fc-cache -f -v ~/.fonts
2007-04-13T16:09:00.000Z	Mr_Giraffe		nifty
2007-04-13T16:09:00.000Z	Mr_Giraffe		thanks
2007-04-13T16:09:00.000Z	bokey	Mr_Giraffe	easiest way is copying them to fonts:///
2007-04-13T16:09:00.000Z	bokey		np
2007-04-13T16:09:00.000Z	Mr_Giraffe	bokey	it wouldn't let me though
2007-04-13T16:10:00.000Z	bokey	Mr_Giraffe	you should be root
2007-04-13T16:10:00.000Z	bokey		fonts:/// is for system wide
2007-04-13T16:10:00.000Z	Mr_Giraffe		i thought i was, but maybe not
2007-04-13T16:10:00.000Z	bokey	Mr_Giraffe	ubuntu by default does not allow 'root' login
2007-04-13T16:10:00.000Z	bokey	Mr_Giraffe	so probably you aren't
