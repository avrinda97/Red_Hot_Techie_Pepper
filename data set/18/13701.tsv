2008-06-21T15:39:00.000Z	Jambon		hello. I've been having this issue. See when I switch resolution up from 1024.768 the top panel won't go over to the edge of the screen. It only goes over 1024 pixels and the rest is dead space. this quirk would be ok, if it didn't wreak havoc with the video players. totem shows only black until you drag the window past the end of the panel, and vlc won't fullscreen properly
2008-06-21T15:39:00.000Z	starz	Jambon	you are on vga connection?
2008-06-21T15:40:00.000Z	Jambon	starz	I believe so
2008-06-21T15:40:00.000Z	Jambon	starz	yes, actually.
2008-06-21T15:40:00.000Z	starz	Jambon	xrandr |grep current
2008-06-21T15:41:00.000Z	Jambon	starz	Screen 0: minimum 320 x 200, current 1280 x 864, maximum 1280 x 1200
2008-06-21T15:42:00.000Z	starz	Jambon	do the resolution thing, and tell me what refresh are you at?
2008-06-21T15:42:00.000Z	Jambon	starz	though in preferences the screen resolution manager says I'm at 1152x864@75hz
2008-06-21T15:43:00.000Z	starz	Jambon	try messing with preferences screen resolution
2008-06-21T15:43:00.000Z	Jambon	starz	just the resolution or refresh rate too?
2008-06-21T15:43:00.000Z	starz	Jambon	all of that
2008-06-21T15:46:00.000Z	Jambon	starz	I only have one option at 1152 (75Hz) and 1280(60hz). in both the top bar only goes 1024 over then stops. restarting or making new bars doesn't change this behavior
2008-06-21T15:46:00.000Z	starz	Jambon	what video card/drivers?
2008-06-21T15:48:00.000Z	Jambon	starz	ati mobility 9200.
2008-06-21T15:48:00.000Z	starz	Jambon	might be you need a better driver.
2008-06-21T15:54:00.000Z	Jambon	starz	as for the binary drivers, are you sure a 9200 falls under that need?
2008-06-21T15:54:00.000Z	starz	Jambon	i'm not sure at all.
2008-06-21T15:55:00.000Z	starz	Jambon	try #ati
