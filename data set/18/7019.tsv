2008-02-20T23:05:00.000Z	ejer	norml_advocate	it should work, but seems overly complex
2008-02-20T23:05:00.000Z	norml_advocate	ejer	do you have any other ideas?
2008-02-20T23:08:00.000Z	norml_advocate	ejer	do you have a better idea for simpler code?   someone told me you could not access levels in gutsy.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runlevel
2008-02-20T23:08:00.000Z	ejer	norml_advocate	depends what you want to do...
2008-02-20T23:08:00.000Z	ejer	norml_advocate	I would remove gdm from starting at bootup, so you will always startin command line mode
2008-02-20T23:09:00.000Z	ejer	norml_advocate	sudo update-rc.d -f gdm remove
2008-02-20T23:09:00.000Z	ejer	norml_advocate	then to start grafix you do 'sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start'
