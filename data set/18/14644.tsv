2005-08-29T12:57:00.000Z	DrSpin	dabar	Are you using Warty??
2005-08-29T12:57:00.000Z	dabar	DrSpin	a new hoary install.
2005-08-29T12:57:00.000Z	DrSpin	dabar	nvidia or ati??
2005-08-29T12:59:00.000Z	dabar	DrSpin	no graphics card, and restarting the server does not help, and   it does start as normal and works as long as I dont change to console...
2005-08-29T12:59:00.000Z	DrSpin	dabar	LOL -- you have to have a graphics card for the display to function
2005-08-29T12:59:00.000Z	dabar		start as normal=when you boot,..
2005-08-29T13:00:00.000Z	dabar	DrSpin	and by no graphics card, i mean its an onboard thing.

2005-08-29T13:01:00.000Z	dabar	DrSpin	you got the part where: it works when I boot, until I switch to console?
2005-08-29T13:01:00.000Z	DrSpin	dabar	yes
2005-08-29T13:01:00.000Z	dabar		ok, so I should try getting help when I am at that computer?
