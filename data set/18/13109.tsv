2006-01-09T11:28:00.000Z	Manifold		Gah.
2006-01-09T11:28:00.000Z	Manifold		My system's struggling with GNOME.
2006-01-09T11:28:00.000Z	Manifold		Getting lots of slowdown.
2006-01-09T11:28:00.000Z	Manifold		What else can I use apart from GNOME and KDE?
2006-01-09T11:29:00.000Z	Manifold		Which one's easier to configure.
2006-01-09T11:29:00.000Z	Manifold		?
2006-01-09T11:29:00.000Z	Manifold		Right..
2006-01-09T11:29:00.000Z	Manifold		Hrm.
2006-01-09T11:29:00.000Z	Manifold		Oki.
2006-01-09T11:29:00.000Z	Vernon_	Manifold	remember: gnome is not a window manager, is a desktop environment
2006-01-09T11:30:00.000Z	Manifold		Yeah.
2006-01-09T11:30:00.000Z	Vernon_	Manifold	you can still use metacity if you like it, but without gnome
2006-01-09T11:30:00.000Z	Manifold	Vernon_	I'm having trouble multitasking on GNOME.
2006-01-09T11:30:00.000Z	Manifold		What is metacity?
2006-01-09T11:31:00.000Z	Vernon_	Manifold	a part of what you call "gnome"
2006-01-09T11:31:00.000Z	Manifold		!metacity
2006-01-09T11:31:00.000Z	Manifold		I thought Nautilus was.
2006-01-09T11:31:00.000Z	Vernon_	Manifold	try icewm. or xfce4
