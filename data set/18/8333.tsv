2008-01-21T08:19:00.000Z	nemilar		Would anyone be willing to give me a quick instruction on the use of sed/awk?
2008-01-21T08:19:00.000Z	nemilar		I will love you forever
2008-01-21T08:20:00.000Z	jrib	nemilar	#sed and #awk are probably better channels for related questions.  But you can try here too, just be more specific
2008-02-01T04:12:00.000Z	jrib	nemilar	yes?
2008-02-01T04:13:00.000Z	jrib	nemilar	thanks
2008-02-01T04:13:00.000Z	nemilar	jrib	just so I know, is the command ops or "op"
2008-02-01T04:13:00.000Z	jrib	nemilar	you did it correctly, though both may work.  ubotu is just sleeping...
2008-02-02T18:08:00.000Z	jrib	nemilar	no need for recursive, just setting HOME to that would work
2008-02-02T18:08:00.000Z	nemilar	jrib	but then someone can do 'less /home/user/.gaim/accounts.xml' and check out his password ;)
2008-02-02T18:08:00.000Z	jrib	nemilar	can they?
2008-02-02T18:08:00.000Z	nemilar	jrib	you bet'cha
2008-02-02T18:10:00.000Z	jrib	nemilar	give it a try
2008-02-02T18:10:00.000Z	nemilar	jrib	give what a try?
2008-02-02T18:11:00.000Z	jrib	nemilar	make a directory 700 and try to read the contents of a file inside with another user
2008-02-02T18:13:00.000Z	nemilar	jrib	that's interesting... I _know_ that used to work
2008-02-02T18:14:00.000Z	jrib	nemilar	only if you have execute permissions on the directory
2008-02-02T18:16:00.000Z	nemilar	jrib	ahh, interesting.  I was under the mistaken impression that execute only affect directory listing
2008-02-02T18:17:00.000Z	jrib	nemilar	read permissions let you list contents and execute lets you cd in (as I remember)
