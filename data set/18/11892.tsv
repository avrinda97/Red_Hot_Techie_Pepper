2006-06-08T08:45:00.000Z	AlwaysIcey		David, the two files that you need are in the link I provided you with.  Have you already tried downloading them, then following the directions on the page you referred to?
2006-06-08T08:46:00.000Z	AlwaysIcey		Shea, what sound card do you have?
2006-06-08T08:47:00.000Z	SheaTara	AlwaysIcey	lspci says: 0000:00:14.5 Multimedia audio controller: ATI Technologies Inc IXP SB400 AC'97 Audio Controller (rev 02)
2006-06-08T08:49:00.000Z	SheaTara		My sound won't work on an ATI IXP sound card -- it did before I upgraded from KDE 3.5.2 to 3.5.3 -- help
2006-06-08T08:50:00.000Z	AlwaysIcey		Shea, did ubotu whisper you with some links?
2006-06-08T08:50:00.000Z	SheaTara	AlwaysIcey	sorry -- did not see -- I read the first one, but for the second -- I'm ubing dapper, not hoary, but I'll look anyway'
2006-06-08T08:51:00.000Z	AlwaysIcey		K.
2006-06-08T08:52:00.000Z	SheaTara	AlwaysIcey	Looked -- I don;t use ESD either -- I use arts
2006-06-08T08:52:00.000Z	SheaTara	AlwaysIcey	anything more?
2006-06-08T08:53:00.000Z	AlwaysIcey		Not really..  I'm having some of the same issues as you, except that my sound card is ancient.
2006-06-08T08:53:00.000Z	AlwaysIcey		Did you check in the wiki to see if your sound card is supported?  Or maybe in the forums for help.
2006-06-08T08:53:00.000Z	SheaTara	AlwaysIcey	I'll look at some of Xine's conf
2006-06-08T08:54:00.000Z	SheaTara	AlwaysIcey	It already worked before -- yesterday
2006-06-08T08:56:00.000Z	SheaTara	AlwaysIcey	still won't work --
2006-06-08T08:56:00.000Z	AlwaysIcey	Ar2No	try sudo aptitude update It's been working for me, AFAIK.
2006-06-08T08:57:00.000Z	AlwaysIcey		I'm not sure what to tell you then Shea.  It stopped working when you upgraded, or did it work for a while after you upgraded?
2006-06-08T08:58:00.000Z	SheaTara	AlwaysIcey	Stopped working directly thereafter
2006-06-08T08:58:00.000Z	SheaTara	AlwaysIcey	I tried installing fglrx too
