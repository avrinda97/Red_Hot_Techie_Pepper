2005-04-19T12:46:00.000Z	topyli	mvirkkil	where is this logo? gdm?
2005-04-19T12:47:00.000Z	mvirkkil	topyli	http://www.ubuntu.com/
2005-04-19T12:49:00.000Z	topyli	mvirkkil	oh yeah. i wonder if they're going to cover every skin tone eventually :)
2005-04-19T12:49:00.000Z	topyli	mvirkkil	i like the idea though
2005-04-19T12:50:00.000Z	mvirkkil	topyli	I liked the old one. That was slick.
2005-04-19T12:50:00.000Z	topyli	mvirkkil	also, these are more like regular people, not models
2005-04-19T12:50:00.000Z	mvirkkil	topyli	Maybe they should've just put a bit more clothes on, but the graphical look was good
2005-04-19T12:51:00.000Z	topyli	mvirkkil	sure. but they were "beautiful people" ubuntu is for real "human beings"
2005-04-19T12:52:00.000Z	mvirkkil	topyli	Then they should've used seth's pick, since he's even a gnome hacker: http://www.gnome.org/~clarkbw/images/seth.at.chi.jpg
2005-04-19T12:53:00.000Z	mvirkkil	topyli	;-)
2005-04-19T12:53:00.000Z	topyli	mvirkkil	hehe. or the one they had on april 1st :)
2005-04-19T12:59:00.000Z	mvirkkil	topyli	Didn't see the april 1st. Where could I see it?
2005-04-19T13:00:00.000Z	topyli	mvirkkil	if you updated on april 1st, the gdm theme showed a "circle of nerds" hold on, i'll see if i have it in the cache or somewhere
2005-04-19T13:04:00.000Z	topyli	mvirkkil	hm. it's not in the april 1st ubuntu-artwork package :(
2005-04-19T13:05:00.000Z	topyli	mvirkkil	see ^
2005-04-19T13:06:00.000Z	mvirkkil	topyli	:)
2005-04-19T13:06:00.000Z	mvirkkil	topyli	I like thatone almost better than the new logo :-)
2005-04-19T13:06:00.000Z	mvirkkil	topyli	This one is honest, while the newone looks amaturish.
