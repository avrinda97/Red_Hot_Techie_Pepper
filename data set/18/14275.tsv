2005-08-31T14:36:00.000Z	ThePyromaniac		has anyone here ever used win32 on a computer that used to have a 32 bit proccessor, then upgraded to 64-bit?
2005-08-31T14:38:00.000Z	ThePyromaniac		hmm, it says to me "hardware change, bla" and it gives the Safe Mode, Safe Mode with command prompt, reboot with last known good config settings page, ya'll know the one. anyone ever had that?
2005-08-31T14:39:00.000Z	ThePyromaniac		oh and i found the way to remove a broken OS from the boot menu if anyone wants to know, ask me and i will tell ^^
2005-08-31T06:35:00.000Z	ThePyromaniac		does anyone know why when i install ubuntu and kubuntu on the same pc, same versions and same settings, ubuntu reads "Buffer I/O Error on device HDC"?
2005-08-31T06:36:00.000Z	Zhukov_	ThePyromaniac	how did you installed them exactly?
2005-08-31T06:36:00.000Z	Zhukov_		is the dongle displayed?
2005-08-31T06:36:00.000Z	ThePyromaniac		indeed, i take out the cd then it asks me to put it back in
2005-08-31T06:37:00.000Z	ThePyromaniac		it says it cant install some packages. most get thru ok, but some random ones don't work
2005-08-31T06:37:00.000Z	Zhukov_	ThePyromaniac	try install them without the cd
2005-08-31T06:37:00.000Z	ThePyromaniac		how can i install without the cd?
2005-08-31T06:39:00.000Z	Zhukov_	ThePyromaniac	sudo pico /etc/apt/sources.list and add a # to the line of the cd (the first i think), then go to ubuntuguide.org and read the part about enabling extra repositories
2005-08-31T06:39:00.000Z	Zhukov_		sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install kubuntu
2005-08-31T06:39:00.000Z	ThePyromaniac		it has installed weird, it gives me command line and i can do sudo commands and stuff
2005-08-31T06:40:00.000Z	ThePyromaniac	Zhukov_	that i will try, its almost finished installing kubuntu as a test ^^
2005-08-31T06:40:00.000Z	Zhukov_	ThePyromaniac	kubuntu isnt wort it :D im afraid
2005-08-31T06:41:00.000Z	ThePyromaniac		i don't like kubuntu, that's why i have this problem :( i started with it then wanted to install ubuntu. spent 3 days trying
2005-08-31T06:41:00.000Z	ThePyromaniac		i have just reinstalled kub to see if it was hardware or software
2005-08-31T06:42:00.000Z	Zhukov_	ThePyromaniac	you can just install ubuntu and then sudo apt-get install kubuntu
