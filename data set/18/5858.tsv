2008-08-11T13:22:00.000Z	leo_away	fro5tbyt3	all of them work but you'll need qt
2008-08-11T13:22:00.000Z	leo_away	fro5tbyt3	no problem
2008-08-11T13:22:00.000Z	fro5tbyt3	leo_away	QT?
2008-08-11T13:22:00.000Z	leo_away	fro5tbyt3	kde libraries.
2008-08-11T13:22:00.000Z	fro5tbyt3		ok thank you
2008-08-11T13:22:00.000Z	leo_away	fro5tbyt3	if you are short on ram loading gnome libraries and kde libraries might be an issue
2008-08-11T13:23:00.000Z	leo_away	fro5tbyt3	and installing 50mb of libraries for an app might not be appealing to you... other than that go for it
2008-08-11T13:23:00.000Z	fro5tbyt3		haha
2008-08-11T13:24:00.000Z	fro5tbyt3	leo_away	i have gnome installed on top on kubuntu with gdm as the default display manager
2008-08-11T13:24:00.000Z	leo_away	fro5tbyt3	there is an app called gcolor2 in the repos
2008-08-11T13:24:00.000Z	leo_away	fro5tbyt3	oh, ok
