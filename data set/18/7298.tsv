2012-01-30T22:12:00.000Z	saikat		can anybody tell me how to set 1280x800 resolution in 14'' laptop on ubuntu 10.04
2012-01-30T22:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	saikat	what video chip?
2012-01-30T22:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	saikat	have you tried a later release, if you have a fancy new intel gpu, you may benefit from the newer drivers and kernel
2012-01-30T22:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	saikat	why do you 'have to'?
2012-01-30T22:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	saikat	there is a ppa for it but it won't be supported here if you use it
2012-01-30T22:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	saikat	if you use a different kernel to the one intended for your OS it won't be supported here
2012-01-30T22:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	saikat	the other way is to form an xorg.conf file to make the display work
2012-01-30T22:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	saikat	yes, you MAKE it
2012-01-30T22:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	saikat	/etc/X11/xorg.conf
2012-01-30T22:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	saikat	yes, its a text file
2012-01-30T22:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	saikat	I'd try Oneiric liveCD to see if it helps
2012-01-30T22:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	saikat	you will need:  gksudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf     to get write access
2012-01-30T22:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	saikat	there are samples online, you will fid some around if you search, you are going to be trying the configs and if you get no desktop you will need to drop to root recovery mode or TTY1 to rename the file, long process
2012-01-30T22:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	saikat	you could show your customer this: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases
2012-01-30T22:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	saikat	if they want lucid because it is LTS, you can show them that Oneiric (latest stable) is LTS at the same time as Lucid desktop
2012-01-30T22:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	saikat	is EOL, sorry
2012-01-30T22:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	saikat	the support for Lucid deskop and Oneiric desktop expires at the same time, so I would query why Lucid is needed
2012-02-09T11:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	saikat	does it work ok in Oneiric?
