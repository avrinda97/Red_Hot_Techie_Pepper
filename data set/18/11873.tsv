2006-08-10T12:13:00.000Z	iratik		I am so so so lost - I am trying to setup a mailserver so that we can have email addresses on our domain -  But nothing is working
2006-08-10T12:14:00.000Z	iratik		I can send out just fine - using telnet localhost 25, ehlo, rcpt to process
2006-08-10T12:14:00.000Z	iratik		But 1. How do I get outlook to work with it
2006-08-10T12:15:00.000Z	iratik		Yeh I hate outlook- but thats what our clients will be using
2006-08-10T12:15:00.000Z	iratik		Is there a place to talk about mail server issues, a channel somewhere?
2006-08-10T12:15:00.000Z	iratik		its not #mail, not #smtp
2006-08-10T12:16:00.000Z	iratik		I'm honestly really lost on the whole mail setup - and I need some questions answered. Whats a good channel to go to?
2006-08-10T12:17:00.000Z	nate	iratik	depends what server you run. postfix, qmail, sendmail, etc
2006-10-04T08:33:00.000Z	nate	iratik	load is probably through the roof. you need to be able to see whats using the most resources
2006-10-04T08:33:00.000Z	iratik	nate	What do I look for in top?
2006-10-04T08:34:00.000Z	iratik	nate	I looked and it said that system usage was at 8% (but it took about 1.5 minutes to pull up top)
2006-10-04T08:35:00.000Z	iratik	nate	type uptime?
2006-10-04T08:36:00.000Z	iratik	nate	So what do I look for?
2006-10-04T08:38:00.000Z	iratik	nate	I don't see anything that looks like an erro
2006-10-04T08:40:00.000Z	nate	iratik	dunno, it's your server. is it normal?
2006-10-04T08:41:00.000Z	iratik	nate	I'll ask #mysql if its normal - but on '%CPU' it says between 10-16% which isn't much right?
