2008-07-03T23:58:00.000Z	pants		Hello.. I have a Lacie External Hard Drive which, with the help of someone here I managed to read from my Macintosh (which is running Ubuntu) some time ago. Unfortunately now I can read files from it, but am unable to write to it. Can anyone help me be able to write to this drive?
2008-07-04T00:00:00.000Z	pants		Can anyone help with my problem please?
2008-07-04T00:01:00.000Z	CroX	pants	Have you checked the file permissions?
2008-07-04T00:02:00.000Z	pants	CroX	- how can i do that?
2008-07-04T00:02:00.000Z	pants	CroX	- it's an entire external hard drive that I'm unable to write to
2008-07-04T00:02:00.000Z	CroX	pants	When reading the files, do you navigate there with Nautilus or somesuch? How do you read the files?
2008-07-04T00:03:00.000Z	pants	CroX	- either through a file browser or just through the terminal
2008-07-04T00:03:00.000Z	pants	CroX	- I've mounted the drive into a /mount/ folder
2008-07-04T00:03:00.000Z	CroX	pants	Alright. In terminal, do: ls -la
2008-07-04T00:03:00.000Z	CroX	pants	That'll list all files and their details, including file permissions and ownership.
2008-07-04T00:04:00.000Z	pants	CroX	- okay I'm not actually at that machine now, but could you tell me what to do once it's listed?
2008-07-04T00:04:00.000Z	CroX		And there died Pidgin.. What the %Â¤# is going on with my computer? o_O
2008-07-04T00:05:00.000Z	CroX	pants	Well, it should say it belongs to yourname:yourname and that it have permissions rw-?????? or rwx??????, where ? could be anything.
2008-07-04T00:06:00.000Z	pants		Crox - okay, then how do I change those permissions?
2008-07-04T00:06:00.000Z	CroX	pants	If it doesn't belong to you, you want to check out the CHOWN command: chown yourname:yourname file
2008-07-04T00:06:00.000Z	CroX	pants	If it's set to read-only, you want to check out the CHMOD command: chmod ug+rw file
2008-07-04T00:07:00.000Z	pants	CroX	- I'm going to go try that out, it'll probably take 8-10 minutes or so. Can I come find you when I'm back to figure out whether it worked or not?
2008-07-04T00:08:00.000Z	CroX	pants	Maybe. Depending on whether my system continues messing with me or not. :P
