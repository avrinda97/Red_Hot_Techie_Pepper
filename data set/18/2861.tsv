2010-09-06T10:35:00.000Z	cyberjunk502		i want to change my home directory to another partition is that possible with reinstalling
2010-09-06T10:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cyberjunk502	I'd just move the folder in root recovery console then symlink
2010-09-06T10:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cyberjunk502	or you could copy the data then mount the partition as /home
2010-09-06T10:37:00.000Z	cyberjunk502	ActionParsnip	how to mount the partition as /home
2010-09-06T10:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cyberjunk502	you'll need to move the data to another place too or the data will be stored twice. Mounting only replaces the visible data
2010-09-06T10:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cyberjunk502	you'll need a new entry in /etc/fstab for it
2010-09-06T10:39:00.000Z	cyberjunk502	ActionParsnip	Its says i don't have the permission to do so even if i had open it as root
2010-09-06T10:39:00.000Z	cyberjunk502	ActionParsnip	should i log in as root
2010-09-06T10:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cyberjunk502	gksudo gedit /etc/fstab
2010-09-06T10:40:00.000Z	cyberjunk502	ActionParsnip	how to copy the content of home directory
2010-09-06T10:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cyberjunk502	mount the destination as writable and copy the data over
2010-09-06T10:42:00.000Z	cyberjunk502	ActionParsnip	Thanks
2011-02-21T06:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cyberjunk502	no idea, what network chip are you using?
2011-02-21T06:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cyberjunk502	ok, realtek make at least 5 chips I can think of easily, can you narrow it down?
2011-02-21T06:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cyberjunk502	have you disabled ipv6 too, assuming you don't use it
2011-02-21T06:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cyberjunk502	what realtek chip are you using?
2011-02-21T06:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cyberjunk502	then you need to find out using: sudo lshw -C network; lsusb     and you can find out
2011-02-21T06:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cyberjunk502	me too, I'm at work and have SSH'd to my server to then use irssi to IRC ;)
