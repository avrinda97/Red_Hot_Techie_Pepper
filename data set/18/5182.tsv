2009-01-30T07:50:00.000Z	nathanhelp	redvamp128	BlueEagle, How would i go about creating a Fat32 partition from this machine (single boot Ubuntu)
2009-01-30T07:43:00.000Z	redvamp128	nathanhelp	 there is also a ntfs configuration tool which helps mount and unmount NTFS correctly
2009-01-30T07:44:00.000Z	redvamp128	nathanhelp	 it is labeled ntfs-config and is located under the ntfs-3g
2009-01-30T07:45:00.000Z	nathanhelp	redvamp128	symantic will do?
2009-01-30T07:47:00.000Z	redvamp128	nathanhelp	 it is more or less to give the ability to copy from NTFS over to Native but still has the possiblilty of data corruption
2009-01-30T07:48:00.000Z	nathanhelp	redvamp128	BlueEagle: data corruption. Would that include drivers for XP?
2009-01-30T07:48:00.000Z	redvamp128	nathanhelp	 is more or less for large files
2009-01-30T07:49:00.000Z	redvamp128	nathanhelp	 the better work-around is having a fat32 partition for the fileshare between the two
2009-01-30T07:50:00.000Z	redvamp128	nathanhelp	 I would check the following page for more details -- http://www.ntfs-3g.org
2009-01-30T07:52:00.000Z	redvamp128	nathanhelp	 that ntfs-config is a better way to enable and disable write to ntfs
2009-01-30T07:54:00.000Z	nathanhelp	redvamp128	Done that.
2009-01-30T07:54:00.000Z	nathanhelp	redvamp128	ntfsprogs?
2009-01-30T07:54:00.000Z	redvamp128	nathanhelp	 8.10 or 8.04.2?
2009-01-30T07:56:00.000Z	redvamp128	nathanhelp	 Ubuntu -- Package Search Results -- ntfs <http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=ntfs&amp;searchon=names&amp;suite=intrepid&amp;section=all>
2009-01-30T07:56:00.000Z	redvamp128	nathanhelp	 and for the ntfs-config -- Ubuntu -- Package Search Results -- ntfs-config <http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=ntfs-config&amp;searchon=names&amp;suite=intrepid&amp;section=all>
2009-01-30T07:57:00.000Z	nathanhelp	redvamp128	What is FUSE?
2009-01-30T08:13:00.000Z	nathanhelp	redvamp128	BlueEagle, Whats the difference between Using Samba, and ntfs-3g? Can I not just use Samba to access the shared folders on Windows? or am I mis-connecting things?
2009-01-30T08:15:00.000Z	redvamp128	nathanhelp	 I am not sure if samba will default let you write to ntfs-- but does not hurt to have both installed
