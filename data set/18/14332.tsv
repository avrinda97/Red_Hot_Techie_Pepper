2005-08-13T11:26:00.000Z	arpwatch		why oh why does ./configure not run properly....
2005-08-13T11:27:00.000Z	arpwatch		wow, will you help me?
2005-08-13T11:27:00.000Z	arpwatch		yeah it was :P
2005-08-13T11:27:00.000Z	arpwatch		I try to ./configure xmms and it says no acceptable c compiler found in $PATH
2005-08-13T11:27:00.000Z	arpwatch		which I have never experienced before as every other distro always lets ./configure go fine
2005-08-13T11:28:00.000Z	arpwatch		!
2005-08-13T11:28:00.000Z	nickrud	arpwatch	try doing apt-get install build-essential gaim-dev
2005-08-13T11:47:00.000Z	nickrud	arpwatch	ubuntu-base is a list of packages that ubuntu uses to provide basic functionality (like mail). If you use something
2005-08-13T11:49:00.000Z	nickrud	arpwatch	no, apt-get is what lets you get what you want if you thing the master list is not quite right
2005-08-13T11:54:00.000Z	arpwatch	nickrud	shouldn't exim automagically send my queued mail, or is there something I should perform?  I'm having the same problem that I did with postfix
2005-08-13T11:54:00.000Z	nickrud	arpwatch	they keep different queues, for one.
2005-08-13T11:56:00.000Z	nickrud	arpwatch	I use exim for the debconf scripting: it asks for a smarthost, I give it, add a password (I'd have to look that up again) and mail works.
2005-08-13T11:58:00.000Z	arpwatch	nickrud	I'm kind of lost in the whole debain thing, do I need to run a configure on exim before it works?
2005-08-13T12:00:00.000Z	nickrud	arpwatch	hm, I'd suggest what I'm using now, cuz I'm too lazy to look all that stuff up again: evolution, and have it get and drop mail. Sometimes I regret dropping my debian install, because I did this stuff once and it worked forever.
2005-08-13T12:02:00.000Z	arpwatch	nickrud	ok I do use evolution as well for my general email account, but in redhat 5.1  I could use sendmail to send mail directly from the console somehow
2005-08-13T12:05:00.000Z	arpwatch	nickrud	I don't know any other way to explain what I'm trying to do, because I'm not that good at linux to begin with, and I haven't used it in 7yrs
2007-08-05T07:40:00.000Z	nickrud	arpwatch	yes you will
2007-08-05T07:40:00.000Z	nickrud	arpwatch	ubuntu would get _flogged_ if they broke in place upgrades
