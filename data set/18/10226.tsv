2009-04-20T05:21:00.000Z	ewook		Battle of wesnoth is acctually quite fun :)
2009-04-20T05:22:00.000Z	starcannon	ewook	yup, I've killed a few hours on that one myself, its excellent on netbooks to (if you compile it for that)
2009-04-20T05:22:00.000Z	ewook	starcannon	works like a charm on my work-laptop ;)
2009-04-20T05:23:00.000Z	ewook	starcannon	took it directly from the repo, to lazy to compile stuff myself.
2009-04-20T05:24:00.000Z	starcannon	ewook	yeah on my asus eee 702 I had to compile it for the screen size, I forget the flag now, but it sets the game to 840x480 resolution for those little 7inch screens
2009-04-20T05:26:00.000Z	ewook	starcannon	aah. but.. shouldn't that be set in a config instead of in a binary? =(
2009-04-20T05:27:00.000Z	starcannon	ewook	can't remember now, lemme look how it went lol, its been awhile, and I'm on a Dell Mini9 for my netbook nowdays, and wife is on an MSi Wind
2009-04-20T05:28:00.000Z	ewook	starcannon	you've got either patience, or small hands :P
2009-04-20T05:28:00.000Z	starcannon	ewook	the keyboard isn't too small, its poorly layed out
2009-04-20T05:29:00.000Z	starcannon	ewook	the keyboard on the Asus eee, now those are tiny
2009-04-20T05:29:00.000Z	ewook	starcannon	that's like my only comparison so far. don't go below 12" :)
2009-04-20T05:30:00.000Z	starcannon	ewook	the MSi Wind has a large keyboard, quite comfortable, I keep threatening to steal it from my wife lol
2009-04-20T05:33:00.000Z	starcannon	ewook	in case you were interested it was the config file before you run make on it: ./configure --enable-tinygui --prefix=/usr
2009-04-20T05:34:00.000Z	ewook	starcannon	aah. well, good to know at least ;)
2009-04-20T05:34:00.000Z	starcannon	ewook	lol, i suppose, but highly unlikely, I anticipate that 10" screens will be the defacto for netbooks, I've tried 7", 8.9", and now 10" and its the perfect fit of very small, but not too.
