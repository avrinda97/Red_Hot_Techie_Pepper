2007-01-29T08:53:00.000Z	hamre__		hello. i just used ifconfig and iwconfig (along with ubuntu's network tool) to configure access to my wireless ap. dhclient ath0 worked, i got my own ip and /etc/resolv.conf was written, but still i can't ping my dns, anybody know what i'm missing?
2007-01-29T08:54:00.000Z	bulmer	hamre__	what does netstat -ran shows?  does it have a gateway?
2007-01-29T08:56:00.000Z	hamre__	bulmer	cool, it gateway shows 0.0.0.0, and the other 10.0.0.0
2007-01-29T08:56:00.000Z	hamre__	bulmer	10.0.0.138 is the router i believe
2007-01-29T08:56:00.000Z	bulmer	hamre__	are those really valid ip addres?
2007-01-29T08:56:00.000Z	hamre__	bulmer	no =) how do i set them?
2007-01-29T08:56:00.000Z	bulmer	hamre__	then make sure that is the correct gateway then..
2007-01-29T08:56:00.000Z	hamre__	bulmer	i tried route add default 10.0.0.138 but that didn't work
2007-01-29T08:56:00.000Z	hamre__	bulmer	but how?
2007-01-29T08:57:00.000Z	bulmer	hamre__	keep looking at the result of that netstat -ran and see if gateway gets added
2007-01-29T08:57:00.000Z	bulmer	hamre__	maybe use the network manager to add
2007-01-29T08:57:00.000Z	hamre__	bulmer	isn't there a configuration file somewhere?
2007-01-29T08:58:00.000Z	bulmer	hamre__	yes..its /etc/network/interfaces
2007-01-29T08:58:00.000Z	hamre__	bulmer	the gateway too resides in there?
2007-01-29T08:59:00.000Z	bulmer	hamre__	yes, for static at least am sure..
2007-01-29T09:35:00.000Z	bulmer	hamre__	you need to make sure the gateway is working
2007-01-29T09:41:00.000Z	hamre__	bulmer	well do you have any suggestions?
2007-01-29T09:42:00.000Z	bulmer	hamre__	can you paste-bin your netstat -ran result?
