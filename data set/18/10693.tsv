2006-11-02T11:55:00.000Z	rarcke		I installed Xine, and double checked it but Amarok still just skips right through my files.

2006-11-02T11:57:00.000Z	rarcke		I think I have that.

2006-11-02T11:59:00.000Z	johso	rarcke	if you haven't tried it, remove the version you have installed, and try this: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Amarok#head-c33c648c0ea0118764ef47028eece1a710e060a8
2006-11-02T12:02:00.000Z	rarcke	johso	jsut tried all that
2006-11-02T12:03:00.000Z	rarcke	johso	I got an error that it could not be installed for some reason
2006-11-02T12:03:00.000Z	johso	rarcke	which reason? did you try "sudo apt-get install -f"?
2006-11-02T12:04:00.000Z	rarcke	johso	just tried it with the "-f" now, it says The following packages have unmet dependencies:
2006-11-02T12:04:00.000Z	rarcke		  amarok: Depends: libvisual-0.4-0 (>= 0.4.0) but it is not installable
2006-11-02T12:04:00.000Z	rarcke		E: Broken packages"
2006-11-02T12:12:00.000Z	johso	rarcke	sorry for my slow reply. I guess you don't have an original sources.list? sounds like you might have packages from other versions of Ubuntu...
