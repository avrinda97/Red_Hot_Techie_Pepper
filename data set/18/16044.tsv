2005-12-14T09:30:00.000Z	Falstius	ma5terdp	yes, mount -t hfs -o remount,rw /dev/hda /mnt/spot
2005-12-14T09:34:00.000Z	Falstius	ma5terdp	what I wrote?  It should, if there is write support for it.

2005-12-14T09:37:00.000Z	Falstius	ma5terdp	why do you need a user and password?
2005-12-14T09:49:00.000Z	Falstius	ma5terdp	can you type "mount" and paste the line for the hfsplus drive?
2005-12-14T09:51:00.000Z	Falstius	ma5terdp	have you tried writting to it using sudo?  try "sudo touch /mntpoint/testfile"
2005-12-14T09:51:00.000Z	Falstius	ma5terdp	where /mntpoint is whereever you mount it.
2005-12-14T09:59:00.000Z	Falstius	ma5terdp	yes, but there is a very pretty woman who wants me to go to bed soon.
