2009-06-26T10:10:00.000Z	WIGGMPk		Can anyone suggest a good IDE for Visual Basic, Visual C++, Java, & .NET ??
2009-06-26T10:11:00.000Z	wolter	WIGGMPk	I can only think of mono-develop
2009-06-26T10:11:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	wolter	isnt Mono just for .NET?
2009-06-26T10:13:00.000Z	wolter	WIGGMPk	no
2009-06-26T10:13:00.000Z	wolter	WIGGMPk	i mean, mono is some adaptation of .NET, but mono-develop can do other languages like C++
2009-06-26T10:13:00.000Z	wolter	WIGGMPk	let me tell you which languages can monodevelop od
2009-06-26T10:14:00.000Z	wolter	WIGGMPk	C, C#, C++, VBNet, Web (i guess html, css, js), XML
2009-06-26T10:15:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	wolter	crdlb: Visual Basic is now VB .NET right?
2009-06-26T10:18:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	wolter	crdlb: mono sounds like what i need.. either of you wouldnt happen to know of a good Visual C++ IDE now?
2009-06-26T10:18:00.000Z	wolter	WIGGMPk	I don't think so
2009-06-26T10:19:00.000Z	wolter	WIGGMPk	with Visual you mean like with GUI builder?
2009-06-26T10:19:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	wolter	yes
2009-06-26T10:21:00.000Z	wolter	WIGGMPk	then I don't know anything other than mono develop
2009-06-26T10:22:00.000Z	wolter	WIGGMPk	well, actually I don't know if mono has it
2009-06-26T10:22:00.000Z	wolter	WIGGMPk	what kind of gui are you looking for?
2009-06-26T10:30:00.000Z	wolter	WIGGMPk	I think you want mono then
2009-06-26T10:30:00.000Z	wolter	WIGGMPk	check out the site
2009-06-26T10:31:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	wolter	well mono is the only one that I found that does VB.NET.. the other one "NetBeans" also does Ruby which looks interesting
