2011-02-24T03:53:00.000Z	tuzlo		I am tryint to install testdisk using the Ubuntu Software center and for the last hour it has been hung up in the applying changes. Ideas on how to get this package installed
2011-02-24T03:53:00.000Z	bc81	tuzlo	do you have open synaptic?
2011-02-24T03:54:00.000Z	tuzlo	bc81	just Ubuntu software center, should I use synaptic instead?
2011-02-24T03:54:00.000Z	bc81	tuzlo	no, just asking because USC will hang if another package manageris open
2011-02-24T03:55:00.000Z	tuzlo	bc81	no no other one is open
2011-02-24T03:56:00.000Z	bc81	tuzlo	maybe it's process is hang?  system >> admin >> system monitor > processes
2011-02-24T03:57:00.000Z	tuzlo	bc81	which process am I looking for?
2011-02-24T03:58:00.000Z	bc81	tuzlo	update manager, synaptic, gnome-terminal etc
2011-02-24T03:59:00.000Z	tuzlo	bc81	ok, done, now how do I get this package to install properly?
2011-02-24T03:59:00.000Z	bc81	tuzlo	you can try from a terminal: sudo apt-get install <package>
2011-02-24T04:01:00.000Z	tuzlo	bc81	 says another process is using dpkg, but I killed them
2011-02-24T04:01:00.000Z	bc81	tuzlo	ok, good work :)
2011-02-24T04:01:00.000Z	tuzlo	bc81	 cant find anoything using dpkg, but still it wont install
2011-02-24T04:02:00.000Z	bc81	tuzlo	hmm...i would probably log out/in to be sure
2011-02-24T04:03:00.000Z	tuzlo	bc81	 but will logging out and back in killl the process psaux|grep dpkg gives me a runing process trying to install testdisk still
2011-02-24T04:05:00.000Z	bc81	tuzlo	see, you are more advanced than me :)  just suggesting what i would try at this point
2011-02-24T04:10:00.000Z	bc81	tuzlo	amin ilessthan3ubuntu already said port 22, no?
