2012-06-24T01:53:00.000Z	c_smith		Hello, Brasero is giving me SCSI errors when I try to burn, well, anything, I tried K3B, and K3B gives me a notice that Wodim was unable to fixate the disk after an error which I can fix by setting permissions. is there anything I can try?
2012-06-24T01:54:00.000Z	genii-around	c_smith	Is your user in the cdrom and plugdev groups?
2012-06-24T01:55:00.000Z	c_smith	genii-around	let me check
2012-06-24T01:56:00.000Z	c_smith	genii-around	yes.
2012-06-24T01:56:00.000Z	c_smith		and as I said, brasero gives me some sort of SCSI error
2012-06-24T01:56:00.000Z	c_smith		I have k3b open.
2012-06-24T01:57:00.000Z	genii-around		Hm
2012-06-24T02:03:00.000Z	c_smith	genii-around	I tried K3B with the burning group, no luck.
2012-06-24T02:18:00.000Z	c_smith	genii-around	I ran the ISO through cdrecord, and this is the output I got: http://pastebin.com/PN8ZzyHN
2012-06-24T02:21:00.000Z	genii-around	c_smith	It's saying "medium error" there... Is the cd/dvd/etc you have inserted compatible with the DVD+RW format you have selected to burn in?
2012-06-24T02:22:00.000Z	c_smith	genii-around	I have no clue.
2012-06-24T02:22:00.000Z	c_smith	genii-around	the disk is a DVD-RW if that's what you mean.
2012-06-24T02:23:00.000Z	c_smith		might as well try a fresh disk.
2012-06-24T02:26:00.000Z	c_smith	genii-around	I tried a fresh disc, same output. so I can only assume it is my drive. >.< I don't have the money to replace it.
2012-06-24T02:27:00.000Z	genii-around	c_smith	It seems possible that the laser which reads the media is going/kaput
2012-06-24T02:28:00.000Z	c_smith	genii-around	and I have no money to get it repaired.
2012-06-24T02:28:00.000Z	c_smith	genii-around	funny thing is is that it reads just fine.
2012-06-24T02:36:00.000Z	genii-around	c_smith	What is the result of: wodim -scanbus -vV
