2005-10-22T12:24:00.000Z	Ayiden		Hi, im in a bit of a predicament... I have 3 packages that need THEMSELVES to install One needs the other and the other the one before... arg***
2005-10-22T12:24:00.000Z	Ayiden		libxi-dev libxext-dev and x11proto-xext-dev
2005-10-22T12:24:00.000Z	Ayiden		how can I install them if each one of thm need the other as a dependency?
2005-10-22T12:25:00.000Z	sn9	Ayiden	what are you installing?
2005-10-22T12:30:00.000Z	sn9	Ayiden	is your modem the sagemfast800?
2005-10-22T12:30:00.000Z	sn9	Ayiden	oh. are you using linuxant?
2005-10-22T12:31:00.000Z	Ayiden	sn9	yes
2005-10-22T12:31:00.000Z	sn9	Ayiden	can you temporarily get broadband access to the machine?
2005-10-22T12:32:00.000Z	sn9	Ayiden	have you already transfered all the necessary .deb files over?
2005-10-22T12:33:00.000Z	sn9	Ayiden	did you dpkg -i each one?
2005-10-22T12:34:00.000Z	sn9	Ayiden	i don't know of any kubuntu utility that will do that without net access
2005-10-22T12:34:00.000Z	sn9	Ayiden	dpkg -i
2005-10-22T12:36:00.000Z	sn9	Ayiden	dpkg -i
2005-10-22T12:37:00.000Z	Ayiden	sn9	 that will still use depencies.. i was thinking more like dpkg -i -f .. but I dont think thats enough
2005-10-22T12:37:00.000Z	sn9	Ayiden	you WANT dependencies!
2005-10-22T12:38:00.000Z	sn9	Ayiden	dpkg -i does a forced install
2005-10-22T12:39:00.000Z	Ayiden	sn9	 you see libxext-dev need x11proto which needs lin\bxi-dev which neds libxext-dev
2005-10-22T12:40:00.000Z	sn9	Ayiden	force install them anyway
