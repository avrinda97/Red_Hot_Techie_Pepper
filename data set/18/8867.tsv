2010-08-28T23:23:00.000Z	xibalba		hey i really need some assistance
2010-08-28T23:23:00.000Z	xibalba		it's probably an easy thing too
2010-08-28T23:23:00.000Z	xibalba		i'mj ust trying to figure out what scsi device /dev/sdc matches to
2010-08-28T23:23:00.000Z	arrrghhh	xibalba	sudo fdisk -l
2010-08-28T23:23:00.000Z	xibalba	arrrghhh	: did that, thanks but it does not show me
2010-08-28T23:24:00.000Z	arrrghhh	xibalba	uhm i'm not sure what you're asking.  ls -lah /dev/disk/by-uuid?
2010-08-28T23:24:00.000Z	xibalba	arrrghhh	: i'm trying to see if /dev/sdc matches /dev/sg3
2010-08-28T23:30:00.000Z	arrrghhh	xibalba	you need to look at the output of those commands and figure it out... what do you need?   you should have all the output.
2010-08-28T23:31:00.000Z	xibalba	arrrghhh	: the onyl thing i cannot see in the output is if the /dev/sdd device matches the RAW SCSI device /dev/sg3 -- it might just be a common understanding a matches 0 , b matches 1, so on and so forth. i'mj ust trying to find a way to verify this.
2010-08-28T23:31:00.000Z	xibalba	arrrghhh	: i hope that makes sense
2010-08-28T23:32:00.000Z	arrrghhh	xibalba	what are you trying to achieve?   what are you doing exactly?  i've heard you want to verify this or that, but what is it you're really trying to do?
2010-08-28T23:32:00.000Z	xibalba	arrrghhh	: remove the right SCSI drive out of this vmware server
2010-08-28T23:33:00.000Z	arrrghhh	xibalba	you'll have to compare that output to the output of "mount"
2010-08-28T23:34:00.000Z	xibalba	arrrghhh	: yeah that only shows it in the form of sda/sdb/etc...
2010-08-28T23:34:00.000Z	arrrghhh	xibalba	you have to compare them.
2010-08-28T23:38:00.000Z	arrrghhh	xibalba	service <service> stop/start
2010-08-28T23:38:00.000Z	arrrghhh	xibalba	are you on 10.04?
2010-08-28T23:39:00.000Z	arrrghhh	xibalba	it's /etc/init.d/<service> start/stop/etc - but that's an unsupported distro...
