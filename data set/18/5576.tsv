2008-11-27T17:32:00.000Z	Cybertinus		hi
2008-11-27T17:34:00.000Z	Cybertinus		During the install of Ubuntu, can I choose to create a GPT partition table, instead of the default partition table?
2008-11-27T17:36:00.000Z	Cybertinus		ok, thnx ikonia, will download the alternate CD then
2008-11-27T17:37:00.000Z	speakman	Cybertinus	use MBR style, create LVM-partitions and use LVM2.
2008-11-27T17:41:00.000Z	Cybertinus	speakman	is it possible to move a current GPT partition without LVM to a partition with LVM without formating?
2008-11-27T17:46:00.000Z	speakman	Cybertinus	Never used GPT, but moving to LVM probably requires some formating.
2008-11-27T17:47:00.000Z	Cybertinus	speakman	ah, ok. Then is LVM not an option :). I can't format my current GPT partition. I don't have the diskspace to temporary move 4,5 TB to another place ;)
2008-11-27T17:49:00.000Z	speakman	Cybertinus	is it completely filled with 4,5TB? else it could be done in steps..
2008-11-27T17:50:00.000Z	Cybertinus	speakman	it is 1 partition of 4,5 TB
2008-11-27T17:50:00.000Z	speakman	Cybertinus	is it filled with data?
2008-11-27T17:50:00.000Z	Cybertinus	speakman	yeah, mostly
2008-11-27T17:50:00.000Z	Cybertinus	speakman	ext3
2008-11-27T17:52:00.000Z	Cybertinus	speakman	I don't have a 1,5 TB USB disk. I do have 3 500 GB USB/eSATA disks :)
2008-11-27T17:52:00.000Z	Cybertinus	speakman	 but those are also used with data
2008-11-27T17:53:00.000Z	speakman	Cybertinus	i'm talking about *free* space for temporary storage.
2008-11-27T17:53:00.000Z	Cybertinus	speakman	Like I said: I don't have any ;)
2008-11-27T17:57:00.000Z	speakman	Cybertinus	why did you even ask if you could create GPT partitions if you weren't going to format it anyway?
2008-11-27T18:16:00.000Z	Cybertinus	speakman	because the 4,5 TB disk is already GPT. Well, actually, at the moment the disk is only 3 TB (it already is RAID6). It is a 6x 750 GB disk now. Next to it I've got 2 36 GB disks in RAID0. That RAID0 set is my OS RAID set. I'm thinking about trowing out the RAID0 and running only on the RAID6. Then I also expand my RAID6 set with another 2 750 GB disk, which gets me to the mentioned 8x 750 GB RAID6 set which has a storage of 4,5 TB.
