2007-06-04T16:30:00.000Z	user_		can anybody tell me something about how good mac mini hardware is? (software is not so intresting cuz there is alot of oss out htere ;)
2007-06-04T16:32:00.000Z	SDO	user_	I have 2 mac minis, and loke them both very mcuh ,one is intel dual core 2 gig ram, and toher is PPC, the dual core is my fav.
2007-06-04T16:34:00.000Z	user_	SDO	1) check macminihacks website for ur question, 2) have u let osx there, or put linux on it?:) (or somthing like that)
2007-06-04T16:34:00.000Z	SDO	user_	have osx on it, with parallels running to make xp and ubuntu work.
2007-06-04T16:35:00.000Z	user_	SDO	r u familar with Windows/Linux, how do u find osx?:)
2007-06-04T16:36:00.000Z	user_	SDO	btw, never used macos, but familar with win/lin :)
2007-06-04T16:36:00.000Z	SDO	user_	I have been using OS X since it was NeXTstep, so I like OS X nice.  Windows and Linux are necessary for my job too, so I use them to test software.
2007-06-04T16:36:00.000Z	SDO		OS X is pretty fast and fairly usable for all levels of users, so it is a good OS in general.
2007-06-04T16:37:00.000Z	SDO		try it out with a mac mini, I like having 2 OSs on it running in tandem, and look to have Solaris and Linux running here soon.
2007-06-04T16:37:00.000Z	SDO		the days of hardware are over, and VM solutions like Parallels and VMWare are here to stay :)
2007-06-04T16:38:00.000Z	user_	SDO	i have some question, like.. how is osx about openness, i mean, if i compare lin to win.. win is somthing i dont want to go back cuz in lin i defenately have a a freedon to do with the system waht i want
2007-06-04T16:39:00.000Z	SDO		you can mangle the OS X all you want.  It is fairly open, but in the sense of like Linux, there isn't much like linux regarding openess.
2007-06-04T16:39:00.000Z	SDO		but the best ting to do is just buy a mac mini before they are no longer avaialble, and try i tout.  I pretty much can say you will get $$$ out of it if you decide to sell.
2007-06-04T16:40:00.000Z	user_	SDO	ive also heard that rumor about closing a book on mac mini, but its not official euhm..
2007-06-04T16:41:00.000Z	SDO		it may be, and from the sounds of it hte iTV is giong to be slated to replace the mac mini at the consumer level and provide media experience as well.  It does make sense, adn I would count the mini out of production in less than 6 months so that it doesn't compete with xmas/winter sales.
2007-06-04T16:41:00.000Z	SDO		just my thoughts.
2007-06-04T16:41:00.000Z	SDO		good luck.
2007-06-04T16:43:00.000Z	user_	SDO	waht can u tell about a video processor of duel core, (i guess its the last generation one)
