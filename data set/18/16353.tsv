2005-04-05T14:19:00.000Z	samatman_		ok...i got a 'stable' version of the rt2500 driver source, and this one actualy *does* stuff when i type make...but it ends up in error
2005-04-05T14:19:00.000Z	samatman_		for whoever is interested
2005-04-05T14:20:00.000Z	samatman_		night
2005-04-05T14:21:00.000Z	samatman_		how can you use apt-get to update to hoary?
2005-04-05T14:21:00.000Z	samatman_		dreadlocked rasta...
2005-04-05T14:22:00.000Z	topyli	samatman_	upgrade works just like in debian
2005-04-05T14:22:00.000Z	topyli	samatman_	well, try the ubuntu upgrade and you'll know how debian works :)
2005-04-05T14:23:00.000Z	topyli	samatman_	change sources.list, apt-get update, then apt-get upgrade and apt-get dist-upgrade. then pray
2005-04-05T14:33:00.000Z	topyli	samatman_	add "-o user" to the mount command, perhaps an umask too. also, the mount directory should be readable to mortals
2005-04-05T14:36:00.000Z	topyli	samatman_	something is using it. it's the current working dir of a shell or a program
2005-04-05T14:37:00.000Z	topyli	samatman_	hrm. are you using sudo for the umount command?
2005-04-05T14:38:00.000Z	topyli	samatman_	some lsof magic would reveal what's using it but that's a bit beyond me :)
2005-04-05T14:39:00.000Z	topyli	samatman_	a command to list open files
2005-04-05T14:40:00.000Z	topyli	samatman_	gives enormous outputs, with skillful grepping it gives you the info you need
2005-04-05T14:40:00.000Z	topyli	samatman_	like lsof | grep /mount/point perhaps
2005-04-05T14:43:00.000Z	topyli	samatman_	yeah, it's probably wrong. i never could use lsof properly :(
2005-04-05T14:44:00.000Z	topyli	samatman_	it's ntfs? may require extra voodoo
2005-04-05T14:50:00.000Z	topyli	samatman_	still about the ntfs drive. best you add a decent entry for it in /etc/fstab and it will always mount at boot. read-only mind you. (when you re-focus yourself to that)
