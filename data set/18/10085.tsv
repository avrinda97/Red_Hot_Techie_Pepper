2010-05-19T00:23:00.000Z	ripdisk		i can't get my driver to show up in the hardware drivers window... i know my graphics card is supported, but it still tries to load the drivers for my previous card
2010-05-19T00:23:00.000Z	ripdisk		and i tried to install the drivers manually but they're all .rpm files
2010-05-19T00:24:00.000Z	ripdisk		please, this is the most frustrating thing ever.. having hardware that i KNOW will work and having it not work
2010-05-19T00:24:00.000Z	ripdisk		my videocard is supported but i can't get the darn drivers
2010-05-19T00:26:00.000Z	Pici	ripdisk	I do not believe  that the currenly fglrx driver support the radeon 9800.  You should be getting 3d support from the open source radeon driver that comes with Ubuntu.
2010-05-19T00:27:00.000Z	ripdisk	Pici	PHew. good thing i don't have a radeon 9800
2010-05-19T00:27:00.000Z	Pici	ripdisk	Or the 9200.
2010-05-19T00:27:00.000Z	ripdisk		i took that one out, pici
2010-05-19T00:27:00.000Z	ripdisk		i put one i knew would work in it
2010-05-19T00:27:00.000Z	ripdisk		i put my 9600 in it
2010-05-19T00:27:00.000Z	ripdisk		and i KNOW it works, i've used it before
2010-05-19T00:30:00.000Z	ripdisk		soooo... does this mean all of the ati drivers are broken now or what
2010-05-19T00:31:00.000Z	ripdisk		okie dokie then
2010-05-19T00:31:00.000Z	ripdisk		i guess that means "yes, all of the drivers are broken"
2010-05-19T00:32:00.000Z	Pici	ripdisk	Can I assume that you've already looked in System>Adminstration>Hardware Drivers?
2010-05-19T00:33:00.000Z	ripdisk		pici: yes.
2010-05-19T00:33:00.000Z	ripdisk		pici: i could have sworn the radeon 9600 worked like a year ago for me
2010-05-19T00:34:00.000Z	Pici	ripdisk	Just because it worked a year ago doesn't mean that fglrx still supports it.  My x1400 card used to be supported fglrx, but now I must use the radeon driver.
