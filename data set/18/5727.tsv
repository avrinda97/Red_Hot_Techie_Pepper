2008-11-08T12:31:00.000Z	reverendnathan		Oh hay guys, problem. Something is hemorraging space. I never have any room, and can't restart because I end up with so little free space xorg doesn't start. Is there perhaps an immediate diagnosis or a visualization of my hard drive I can obtain?
2008-11-08T12:32:00.000Z	outbackwifi	reverendnathan	du -h should give you a clue
2008-11-08T12:36:00.000Z	reverendnathan	outbackwifi	nah, nothin exceeding 300mb at lease.
2008-11-08T12:37:00.000Z	outbackwifi	reverendnathan	and df -h shows 100% on root partition?
2008-11-08T12:39:00.000Z	reverendnathan	outbackwifi	yes
2008-11-08T12:47:00.000Z	outbackwifi	reverendnathan	go to /var/log/messages and do a du -h inside this directory; pastebin the output of that
2008-11-08T12:49:00.000Z	reverendnathan	outbackwifi	OK hold on
2008-11-08T12:50:00.000Z	reverendnathan	outbackwifi	not a directory. /var/log totals 5.5Mb
2008-11-08T12:50:00.000Z	outbackwifi	reverendnathan	are you on ubuntu?
2008-11-08T12:52:00.000Z	reverendnathan	outbackwifi	kubuntu 8.x
2008-11-08T12:53:00.000Z	outbackwifi	reverendnathan	yours is the first ubuntu that didnt have the /var/log/ as a directory :)
2008-11-08T12:54:00.000Z	reverendnathan	outbackwifi	/var/log is there, /var/log/messages/ is not one.
2008-11-08T12:55:00.000Z	outbackwifi	reverendnathan	oh ok my bad (didnt realize that i had asked you to cd to /var/log/messages)
2008-11-08T12:55:00.000Z	outbackwifi	reverendnathan	can you cd to /var/log and then run du -h . inside it pls
2008-11-08T12:56:00.000Z	reverendnathan	outbackwifi	http://paste.ubuntu.com/69131/
2008-11-08T13:00:00.000Z	outbackwifi	reverendnathan	the logs look cool; how much disk space do you totally have?
2008-11-08T13:02:00.000Z	outbackwifi	reverendnathan	one area where you can immediately salvage some disk space is in your /usr/share/doc
2008-11-08T13:03:00.000Z	outbackwifi	reverendnathan	just delete everything inside that directory as none of us reads the documentation (we come to #ubuntu straight)
