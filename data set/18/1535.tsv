2011-04-10T07:14:00.000Z	gunndawg		Could someone help me set up a USB KVM switch to work with my ubuntu laptop and my winxp desktop?
2011-04-10T07:15:00.000Z	Some_Person	gunndawg	KVM switches (if they're not made by idiots) don't require drivers or anything. Just hook up the switch to each machine as if there was no switch, connect your monitor, keyboard, and mouse to the switch, and it'll just work
2011-04-10T07:16:00.000Z	Some_Person	gunndawg	And you only have one monitor connected?
2011-04-10T07:16:00.000Z	gunndawg	Some_Person	yeah it was an easy setup however when I switch to my laptop(ubuntu) my laptop screen stays the same and my primary monitor that it should be using just acts as a second monitor to ubuntu, blank workspace but still shows the top panel
2011-04-10T07:17:00.000Z	gunndawg	Some_Person	yes just 1 monitor, unless you count the laptop monitor, would that cause an issue ?
2011-04-10T07:17:00.000Z	Some_Person	gunndawg	Ah, it's a laptop. Go to System -> Preferences -> Monitor and enable "Same image on all monitors"
2011-04-10T07:17:00.000Z	gunndawg	Some_Person	let me try that
2011-04-10T07:17:00.000Z	Some_Person	gunndawg	The built-in display counts as a separate display
2011-04-10T07:18:00.000Z	gunndawg	Some_Person	thx, got it workin, would I be able to close my laptop now and keep this working ?
2011-04-10T07:19:00.000Z	Some_Person	gunndawg	of course
2011-04-10T07:25:00.000Z	gunndawg	Some_Person	how do I make it so when I close the lid/screen on my laptop it doesnt log out/hibernate, etc ?
2011-04-10T07:26:00.000Z	Some_Person	gunndawg	System -> Preferences -> Power Management. Change "When laptop lid is closed" to "Blank screen" on both tabs
2011-04-10T07:27:00.000Z	gunndawg	Some_Person	Ben64 thanks!
2011-04-10T07:28:00.000Z	gunndawg	Some_Person	I might be digging a bit deep here, but now that I have that working. is there anyway to have my primary monitor display ubuntu in a diff resolution ?
2011-04-10T07:29:00.000Z	gunndawg	Some_Person	because on my laptop where ubuntu is installed its set up for a laptop resolution, can I have it be 1280 x 1024 since I am now viewing it from my desktop monitor ?
2011-04-10T07:29:00.000Z	Some_Person	gunndawg	No. If you mirror screens, you have to have the resolution the same on both monitors. How the heck could it draw the same thing in two resolutions?
2011-04-10T07:29:00.000Z	gunndawg	Some_Person	eh good point, sorry, heh
2011-04-10T07:31:00.000Z	Some_Person	gunndawg	If the laptop mirror also supports your desktop monitor's resolution, you can use that. Or you can make the desktop monitor the primary monitor and the laptop one secondary
