2010-08-11T22:11:00.000Z	EdwardL		BlueKaj: md5 sum... Hm... The USB installer didn't say anything about md5 summing anything. Any md5 sum programs you could recommend me?
2010-08-11T22:11:00.000Z	hiku	EdwardL	md5sum
2010-08-11T22:18:00.000Z	hiku	EdwardL	why the f:\? should just be, md5sum nameof.iso
2010-08-11T22:19:00.000Z	EdwardL	hiku	md5sums of iso is one thing. How do I know if the USB stick is different from the iso in any way?
2010-08-11T22:20:00.000Z	hiku	EdwardL	well, the iso you have, was that burning to the usb stick?
2010-08-11T22:20:00.000Z	EdwardL	hiku	I think so. I used Universal USB Installer to put the iso onto the stick in order to install ubuntu onto a computer.
2010-08-11T22:21:00.000Z	hiku	EdwardL	ok, then the md5sum from that iso should match up with the md5sum on the ubuntu website for that iso version, which would then mean that if all is well, the usb stick should be ok.
2010-08-11T22:24:00.000Z	EdwardL	hiku	Not finding any md5 numbers on the download page of http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/get-ubuntu/download
2010-08-11T22:25:00.000Z	hiku	EdwardL	brb
2010-08-11T22:26:00.000Z	hiku	EdwardL	try getting it from - http://mirror.mcs.anl.gov/pub/ubuntu-iso/DVDs/ubuntu/lucid/release/
2010-08-11T22:27:00.000Z	hiku	EdwardL	better yet, use this one, it's for cd's not dvd's. - http://mirror.mcs.anl.gov/pub/ubuntu-iso/CDs-Ubuntu/lucid/
2010-08-11T22:29:00.000Z	EdwardL	hiku	Ok. In 25 minutes I'll see if there is any MD5 difference, and then try that on the stick.
2010-08-11T22:29:00.000Z	hiku	EdwardL	ok...
2010-08-11T22:29:00.000Z	hiku	EdwardL	keep me posted.
2010-08-11T23:50:00.000Z	EdwardL	hiku	Ok, download complete, and I see that the MD5s between the 2 ISOs are very different.
2010-08-11T23:58:00.000Z	EdwardL	hiku	Gonna now attempt to install the new copy.
2010-08-12T00:08:00.000Z	EdwardL	hiku	Success on the installing. Lets see if it runs. ;)
2010-08-12T00:13:00.000Z	EdwardL	hiku	Ok, it is working. Now to see if I can get to some restricted drives or whatever. :S
