2010-06-15T00:54:00.000Z	craigbass1976		I'm having a smidgen of trouble...  WHat are the packages I need to run a samba server?
2010-06-15T00:54:00.000Z	vlt	craigbass1976	"samba" should do it
2010-06-15T00:55:00.000Z	craigbass1976	vlt	I already have the newest version, copied my old smb.conf over, and no love.  I do remember windows having trouble "checking again" for new servers though... That could be the trouble
2010-06-15T00:56:00.000Z	vlt	craigbass1976	What's the problem?
2010-06-15T00:57:00.000Z	craigbass1976	vlt	doesn't show up fo rthe windows boxes.  It doesn't show up even in "view workgroup computers"
2010-06-15T00:58:00.000Z	vlt	craigbass1976	What does `netstat -tulpen | grep :445` look like?
2010-06-15T00:58:00.000Z	craigbass1976	vlt	tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:445             0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      0          241436      -
2010-06-15T00:59:00.000Z	vlt	craigbass1976	Ok, it's running and listening
2010-06-15T00:59:00.000Z	craigbass1976	vlt	I just have to wait for XP to dummy up then?
2010-06-15T00:59:00.000Z	vlt	craigbass1976	What error message do you get when you connect to "//<yourip>/"?
2010-06-15T01:00:00.000Z	craigbass1976	vlt	in what, explorer?\
2010-06-15T01:00:00.000Z	vlt	craigbass1976	In your client, yes.
2010-06-15T01:02:00.000Z	craigbass1976	vlt	keeps firing up firefox
2010-06-15T01:03:00.000Z	vlt	craigbass1976	Try "\\192.168....\" instead (backslash instead of forward, assuming you have a 192.168.* IP address)
2010-06-15T01:04:00.000Z	craigbass1976	vlt	gah... forgot about that / \
2010-06-15T01:16:00.000Z	craigbass1976	vlt	I am able to see it via //192....   It just doesn't show up yet in the list on network neighborhood
2010-06-15T01:18:00.000Z	vlt	craigbass1976	I'm afraid I can't help much there. Check any firewalls and look for samba options containing "*browse*" ... good luck
2010-06-15T01:19:00.000Z	craigbass1976	vlt	and take a hammer to the windows boxes?
