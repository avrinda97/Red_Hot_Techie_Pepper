2010-11-01T15:50:00.000Z	Alinn	burhan	Graphic is onboard (SIS)
2010-11-01T15:51:00.000Z	burhan	Alinn	did it previously work at 1280x1024?
2010-11-01T15:54:00.000Z	Alinn	burhan	yes. i did this in xorg file with this guide: http://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&prev=_t&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&layout=2&eotf=1&sl=auto&tl=en&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwiki.ubuntu.ir%2FChangeResolutionwithXorgEdit%3Fhighlight%3D%2528%25D8%25B1%25D8%25B2%25D9%2588%25D9%2584%25D9%2588%25D8%25B4%25D9%2586%2529
2010-11-01T15:59:00.000Z	burhan	Alinn	/etc/xorg/Xorg.conf should be it, but are you sure it doesn't need specific hardware drivers?
2010-11-01T16:00:00.000Z	Alinn	burhan	I didn't install any driver and i changed it.
2010-11-01T16:00:00.000Z	burhan	Alinn	then edit Xorg.conf
2010-11-01T16:03:00.000Z	Alinn	burhan	Thanks a lot :)
