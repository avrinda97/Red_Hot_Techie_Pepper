2008-12-22T08:23:00.000Z	lyrae	thebloggu	does going to restricted drivers tell you?
2008-12-22T08:23:00.000Z	lyrae	thebloggu	hold on
2008-12-22T08:23:00.000Z	lyrae	thebloggu	but does it give you option to activate any?
2008-12-22T08:25:00.000Z	lyrae	thebloggu	what card again?
2008-12-22T08:28:00.000Z	lyrae	thebloggu	 nvidia-glx-71
2008-12-22T08:28:00.000Z	thebloggu	lyrae	thank you very much :)
2008-12-22T08:29:00.000Z	lyrae	thebloggu	no problem. for the future, just open synaptic, click on 'search'. i searched for "4200" and it returned 2 results. both nvidia drivers. i saw you driver on the description :)
2008-12-22T08:30:00.000Z	thebloggu	lyrae	that's what i did but didn't know what to install. installed 96 and i think it is wrong :P
2008-12-22T08:30:00.000Z	lyrae	thebloggu	=D
2008-12-22T08:31:00.000Z	lyrae	thebloggu	i actually meant 96, not 71. oops. but if 96 didnt work, nothing wrong with trying 71 =D
2008-12-22T08:32:00.000Z	lyrae	thebloggu	is the driver available from the nvidia site itself?
2008-12-22T08:33:00.000Z	thebloggu	lyrae	dont think so
2008-12-22T08:34:00.000Z	lyrae	thebloggu	then i don't know. maybe posting in the forums =)
2008-12-22T08:34:00.000Z	thebloggu	lyrae	thanks anyway ;)
2008-12-22T08:34:00.000Z	lyrae	thebloggu	sorry i tried :(
