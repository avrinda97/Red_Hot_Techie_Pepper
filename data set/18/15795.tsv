2011-05-25T08:24:00.000Z	roothorick	jester	can you open a terminal?
2011-05-25T08:24:00.000Z	roothorick	jester	if you can, ps ax > process-list.txt and pastebin the process-list.txt
2011-05-25T08:24:00.000Z	roothorick	jester	which version Ubuntu btw?
2011-05-25T08:25:00.000Z	roothorick	jester	you probably just clobbered your /etc/sudoers
2011-05-25T08:25:00.000Z	roothorick	jester	actually, pastebin your /etc/sudoers, if you can read it
2011-05-25T08:25:00.000Z	roothorick	jester	use a LiveCD to copy the /etc/sudoers from a working Ubuntu install
2011-05-25T08:27:00.000Z	roothorick	jester	well there's your problem, hahah. Do you have a working Natty machine elsewhere? I don't know if the LiveCD sudoers is the same or not
2011-05-25T08:29:00.000Z	roothorick	jester	long story short, you need to replace your /etc/sudoers. That'll fix your biggest problem by itself.
