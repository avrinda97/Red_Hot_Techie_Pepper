2007-11-21T14:49:00.000Z	VSpike	CIS1987	have you tried starting it from a terminal and seeing if you get any output?
2007-11-21T14:50:00.000Z	CIS1987	VSpike	and how do I do that?
2007-11-21T14:50:00.000Z	VSpike	CIS1987	applications->accessories-<terminal then type "pidgin" and see what happens
2007-11-21T14:51:00.000Z	CIS1987	VSpike	nope nothing happens
2007-11-21T14:51:00.000Z	VSpike	CIS1987	you did press return?
2007-11-21T14:52:00.000Z	VSpike	CIS1987	sorry .. just checking.  When you say nothing happened, you mean you just get the prompt back?
2007-11-21T14:55:00.000Z	CIS1987	VSpike	Yes
2007-11-21T14:55:00.000Z	CIS1987	VSpike	Yes, I get the prompt back
2007-11-21T14:56:00.000Z	VSpike	CIS1987	that's pretty wierd - not sure what else you can try, sorry
2007-11-21T14:56:00.000Z	CIS1987	VSpike	I tried to reinstall it but it also didn't work
