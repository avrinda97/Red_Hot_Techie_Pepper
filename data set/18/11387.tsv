2006-08-04T14:50:00.000Z	thundr	thejusticecow	oh, really?
2006-08-04T14:50:00.000Z	thejusticecow	thundr	yes you need a patch which no one seems to be able to tell me to get...
2006-08-04T14:53:00.000Z	thundr	thejusticecow	it's working for me as well
2006-08-04T14:53:00.000Z	thundr	thejusticecow	version 1.5.1
2006-08-04T14:53:00.000Z	thejusticecow	thundr	for me when i connect to msn it just dissapears and someone told me its a bug that i need a patch for which i can not find
2006-08-04T14:54:00.000Z	thundr	thejusticecow	have you tried reinstalling it?
2006-08-04T14:54:00.000Z	thejusticecow	thundr	nope
2006-08-04T14:54:00.000Z	thejusticecow	thundr	what would be the difference?
2006-08-04T15:10:00.000Z	thundr	thejusticecow	throw a sudo in front of that of course - also, there's a purge command that removes it completely, but use remove in most cases
2006-08-04T15:10:00.000Z	thejusticecow	thundr	may i ask the difference? what to you mean completly? like it puts a bunch of data on top of it so no one can find it on the hdd?
2006-08-04T15:13:00.000Z	thundr	thejusticecow	oh, purge?  I'm not sure, really.  I think it has something to remove the source packages as well from the hdd.
2006-08-04T15:13:00.000Z	thundr	thejusticecow	yes, forceversion - it's easy in synaptic
2006-08-04T15:13:00.000Z	thejusticecow	thundr	thanks
2006-08-04T15:14:00.000Z	thejusticecow	thundr	you mean use the gui in synaptic to get it?
2006-08-04T15:15:00.000Z	thundr	thejusticecow	you can try typing man apt-get for info on the purge flag - yes, in synaptic - it's possible on the command line, but I don't know how
2006-08-04T15:15:00.000Z	thejusticecow	thundr	thank you for tolerating my noobness
2006-08-04T15:16:00.000Z	thundr	thejusticecow	no problem, we're all newbies at some point (I'd barely put myself in "intermediate" in regards to my linux skills)
