2008-01-18T23:23:00.000Z	Scottc	MrObvious	Is that in bytes?
2008-01-18T23:23:00.000Z	MrObvious	Scottc	I think so.
2008-01-18T23:23:00.000Z	MrObvious	Scottc	Apparently I have a 130,000,000 byte drive.
2008-01-18T23:24:00.000Z	MrObvious	Scottc	I have a lot of apps installed too. But that gives you an idea of how much space I'm using. I think it includes my music.
2008-01-18T23:25:00.000Z	MrObvious	Scottc	Outside of /home I'm using 6.3GB according to Nautilus.
2008-01-18T23:40:00.000Z	MrObvious	Scottc	Yes. It can do that automatically and even resize your partitions if you want.
2008-01-19T07:49:00.000Z	MrObvious	Scottc	What happened to your Windows install?
2008-01-19T07:50:00.000Z	MrObvious	Scottc	Vista?
2008-01-19T07:50:00.000Z	Scottc	MrObvious	I dont know
2008-01-19T07:50:00.000Z	MrObvious	Scottc	Well what does it do?
