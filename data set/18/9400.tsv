2007-04-22T06:24:00.000Z	ajehuk	Fylk	- those lines need to be added to /etc/sources.list (anywhere at the bottom) but you can happily replace edgy with feisty i.e. 'deb http://medibuntu.sos-sts.com/repo/ edgy free non-free' becomes 'deb http://medibuntu.sos-sts.com/repo/ feisty free non-free'
2007-04-22T06:25:00.000Z	ajehuk	Fylk	- save and close, yep
