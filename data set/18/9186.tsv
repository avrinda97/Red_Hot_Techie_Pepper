2010-11-21T18:14:00.000Z	david1		yes, arthling_ chromium much faster but a little buggie, specially with flash movies
2010-11-21T18:14:00.000Z	david1		or flash games, earthling_
2010-11-21T18:14:00.000Z	Gnea	david1	flash works just fine for me in chrome
2010-11-21T18:14:00.000Z	Gnea	david1	perhaps you're not using a daily build
2010-11-21T18:14:00.000Z	david1	Gnea	actually im just using chromium from the repositories
2010-11-21T18:15:00.000Z	Gnea	david1	there is a ppa for daily builds

2010-11-21T18:19:00.000Z	Gnea	david1	http://ppa.launchpad.net/gezakovacs/ppa/ubuntu
2010-11-21T18:19:00.000Z	Gnea	david1	I have an EEEpc, chrome and flash work just fine
2010-11-21T18:19:00.000Z	Gnea	david1	as long as I don't try to watch anything HD, it's fine
2010-11-21T18:20:00.000Z	david1	Gnea	i guess when u say chrome, you mean Chromium from repositories
2010-11-21T18:20:00.000Z	Gnea	david1	did you see the url i just gave you?
2010-11-21T18:21:00.000Z	david1	Gnea	i opened it but what is it? just folders....
