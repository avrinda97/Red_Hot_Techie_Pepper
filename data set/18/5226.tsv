2009-07-08T21:51:00.000Z	glitsj16	Ryan1	have you tried right-clicking the file in question and entering the command in the 'Open With' window?
2009-07-08T21:55:00.000Z	Ryan1	glitsj16	I've tried adding a customer command "java -jar executable.jar"
2009-07-08T21:55:00.000Z	Ryan1	glitsj16	using the "Open with" technique
2009-07-08T21:57:00.000Z	glitsj16	Ryan1	try the exact command that works to open those files in a terminal window first and add the command sequence that works i'd suggest ... there is also a package called assogiate (MIME database editor)
2009-07-08T22:02:00.000Z	Ryan1	glitsj16	it worked. Thanks - I was using ~ instead of /home/...
2009-07-08T22:03:00.000Z	Ryan1	glitsj16	Where's the best place to find out more about MIME?
2009-07-08T22:04:00.000Z	glitsj16	Ryan1	the web i'd say :)
2009-07-08T22:06:00.000Z	glitsj16	Ryan1	http://standards.freedesktop.org/shared-mime-info-spec/latest/ might be a starting point, as ubuntu follows the freedesktop standard
2009-07-08T22:06:00.000Z	Ryan1	glitsj16	Thanks a lot!
2009-07-08T22:08:00.000Z	glitsj16		cylonia here
2009-07-08T22:15:00.000Z	Ryan1	glitsj16	perhaps not 100% sorted... The file will only open in the correct application if I use the open with option. If I double click on it, it asks me to run in terminal or display
2009-07-08T22:18:00.000Z	glitsj16	Ryan1	i see, would a short shell script be a better solution for you? Once you make such a script executable, double-clicking will always work
2009-07-08T22:19:00.000Z	Ryan1	glitsj16	That would work for the one instance of the file type I wan to use. Bit of a perfectionist and would like it to just work - you know what I mean? How would I write a script for it?'
2009-07-08T22:21:00.000Z	glitsj16	Ryan1	it shouldn't be very complicated to produce a shell script for that filetype no, just use a text-editor of choice and start the first line with "#!/bin/bash" .. the second line contains the full command to start java etc
2009-07-08T22:23:00.000Z	glitsj16	Ryan1	chmod +x the script file and put in in your ~/bin folder to make sure it's in your PATH
2009-07-08T22:25:00.000Z	Ryan1	glitsj16	ok - how would I associate the file to the java application?
2009-07-08T22:27:00.000Z	glitsj16	Ryan1	same 'Open With' routine as before, this time pointing to the script instead of the java commands
2009-07-08T22:30:00.000Z	glitsj16	Ryan1	out of curiosity, what file extension is the java application using as filename? A more generic solution i think can be achieved through assogiate and adding a (ficticious) MIME type nothing else uses
