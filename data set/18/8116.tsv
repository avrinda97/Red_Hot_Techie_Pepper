2008-01-08T19:26:00.000Z	bazhang	xoqa	wired or wireless
2008-01-08T19:26:00.000Z	xoqa	bazhang	wired
2008-01-08T19:26:00.000Z	bazhang	xoqa	your ethernet does not work? is this gutsy? can you access the computer now?
2008-01-08T19:27:00.000Z	xoqa	bazhang	i can access it but i have to disconnect from irc to do so because i only have on cable.
2008-01-08T19:28:00.000Z	bazhang	xoqa	this is computer you are using now? with another os?
2008-01-08T19:28:00.000Z	xoqa	bazhang	it's another computer, mine. i just got it in the other day. it's a thinkpad t41
2008-01-08T19:30:00.000Z	bazhang	xoqa	can you turn it on an type lspci in the terminal on it and tell (not paste in the channel) what the ethernet card is for that thinkpad--no need to connect at this point

2008-01-08T19:32:00.000Z	bazhang	xoqa	so when you connect it to via ethernet you get no dhcp offers? this via network-manager or the terminal?
2008-01-08T19:33:00.000Z	xoqa	bazhang	terminal
2008-01-08T19:34:00.000Z	bazhang	xoqa	are you going to get this computer going on the same network? if so, via router or second ethernet cable? at some point in time that is
2008-01-08T19:35:00.000Z	xoqa	bazhang	i'm going to unplug the ethernet cable plugged in this one, put it in the other computer's port and reset the cable modem
2008-01-08T19:36:00.000Z	bazhang	xoqa	so both will be on the same network--or just the one computer?
2008-01-08T19:36:00.000Z	xoqa	bazhang	one computer, one connection. one at a time
2008-01-08T19:42:00.000Z	bazhang	xoqa	you have a livecd around? you might want to try booting from the livecd and see if that can acquire an internet connection--hard to know what you have done to your system
2008-01-08T19:46:00.000Z	xoqa	bazhang	i'm sure it can get the internet... i'm going to reboot... brb
