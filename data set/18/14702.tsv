2005-06-25T05:30:00.000Z	lpih		Heh, i have 2 GFX cards in my comp, a GF4TI and voodoo1.
2005-06-25T05:30:00.000Z	lpih		Install defaulted Voodoo1 as my xorg card ;)
2005-06-25T05:30:00.000Z	hondje	lpih	hehehe
2005-06-25T05:31:00.000Z	hondje	lpih	really? I've never had a problem, what drivers you using?
2005-06-25T05:31:00.000Z	lpih	hondje	apt-get install nvidia-glx ;)
2005-06-25T05:31:00.000Z	lpih	hondje	Me and my friend had EXACTLY the same problem, and same solution
2005-06-25T05:32:00.000Z	hondje	lpih	ah, and X dies on you? Not using compositing voodoo?
2005-06-25T05:32:00.000Z	lpih	hondje	I'm using the GF4 now.
2005-06-25T05:32:00.000Z	hondje	lpih	interesting, what's the solution? Is it apg related?
2005-06-25T05:33:00.000Z	lpih	hondje	People on the gentoo forums had same problem
2005-06-25T05:33:00.000Z	hondje	lpih	that's wild....my friend had problems with nvidia and gentoo hardened, but not the kernel..it was pax I think
2005-06-25T05:34:00.000Z	hondje	lpih	ever mess w/ the agp settings in xorg.conf?
2005-06-25T05:34:00.000Z	lpih	hondje	Not really?
2005-06-25T05:35:00.000Z	hondje	lpih	a lot of crashes that have kernel tie-ins are fixed with that
2005-06-25T05:37:00.000Z	hondje	lpih	Option "NvAGP" "integer" is the option
2005-06-25T05:38:00.000Z	lpih	hondje	sounds like rocket science
2005-06-25T05:39:00.000Z	hondje	lpih	nah, rocket science is all F = ma ;-)
2005-06-25T05:39:00.000Z	hondje	lpih	I hear it hypothesized that agpgart changed, and that's why odd stuff happens....just junk I picked up in #nvidia
