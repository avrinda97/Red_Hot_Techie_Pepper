2007-07-01T11:47:00.000Z	n2diy	PurpZeY	ok, I'm I going crazy, or is it Uboutu?
2007-07-01T11:48:00.000Z	PurpZeY	n2diy	You have to update the bot, you're not going crazy.
2007-07-01T11:49:00.000Z	n2diy	PurpZeY	How do I update the bot?
2007-07-01T11:50:00.000Z	PurpZeY	n2diy	http://bots.ubuntulinux.nl/factoids.cgi
2007-07-01T11:51:00.000Z	n2diy	PurpZeY	Kakurady, it is probably best I don't play with the bot, and consider going to sleep?
2007-07-01T11:52:00.000Z	PurpZeY	n2diy	I've been considering going to sleep for 40 minutes, yet I sit here and smoke and be an idiot instead
2007-07-01T11:53:00.000Z	n2diy	PurpZeY	yes, it is easy to be an idiot at this time of night. Kakurady, most of us are newbies, some of us aren't as new as others, that is the only difference.

2007-07-06T08:39:00.000Z	n2diy	PurpZeY	you'll be thinking a long time about that?
2007-07-06T08:40:00.000Z	PurpZeY	n2diy	Frankly I just think it's inaccurate ramblings. But, he said something about freenode closing, something I never heard anything about.
2007-07-06T08:40:00.000Z	n2diy	PurpZeY	rumors have to start somewhere?
2007-07-06T08:40:00.000Z	PurpZeY	n2diy	That's was all I was trying to verify....; )
