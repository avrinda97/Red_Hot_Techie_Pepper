2006-01-11T10:40:00.000Z	Diablo69		I have a major problem that I have been trying to solve for 5 hours
2006-01-11T10:40:00.000Z	Diablo69		I jut converted from fbsd, to try ubuntu....and I installed it, but when it goes to boot it freezes at hotplug
2006-01-11T10:40:00.000Z	Diablo69		any idea on how to fix this?
2006-01-11T10:41:00.000Z	Diablo69		I can't even get to that point
2006-01-11T10:41:00.000Z	Diablo69		I hvaen't even seen the desktop yet
2006-01-11T10:41:00.000Z	Diablo69		is there anyway to disable hotplug:?
2006-01-11T10:43:00.000Z	bshumate	Diablo69	sudo chmod -x /etc/init.d/hotplug* will disable it
2006-01-11T10:44:00.000Z	Diablo69	bshumate	did you have the same problem as I have?
2006-01-11T10:44:00.000Z	bshumate	Diablo69	Applications > Accessories > Terminal > then type the command in the terminal window
2006-01-11T10:44:00.000Z	bshumate	Diablo69	no.  you asked for a way to disable hotplug, and I suggested one. ;-)
2006-01-11T10:45:00.000Z	Diablo69	bshumate	I just installed ubuntu, It won't even boot up, it freezes at hotplug, thats what I am saying
2006-01-11T10:46:00.000Z	bshumate	Diablo69	oh, in that case, you probably need to pass kernel parameters at bootup like acpi=off and such...
2006-01-11T10:50:00.000Z	Diablo69	bshumate	do I hit escape when it tries to load the kernel, and edit the kernel and type in what u said in its place
2006-01-11T10:55:00.000Z	bshumate	Diablo69	oh, what you want at the "boot:" prompt is to enter: linux pci=noacpi
2006-01-11T10:55:00.000Z	bshumate	Diablo69	try that and see if it boots.
2006-01-11T11:48:00.000Z	Diablo69	bshumate	sorry man pc is being a goatwhore again
2006-01-11T11:48:00.000Z	Diablo69	bshumate	I tried what you said and it didn't work, so I am goign to try and reinstall it with the newest version
