2009-07-30T20:21:00.000Z	gartral	Arch1	its also a good way to distribute malware too unsuspecting users
2009-07-30T20:21:00.000Z	Arch1	gartral	What about them?
2009-07-30T20:21:00.000Z	Arch1	gartral	and why are you asking me this?
2009-07-30T20:22:00.000Z	gartral	Arch1	read back dude, i was asking the other guy for his architecture... yeesh
2009-07-30T20:22:00.000Z	Arch1	gartral	oh, sorry
2009-07-30T20:44:00.000Z	gartral	Arch1	do you have AOSS?
2009-07-30T20:44:00.000Z	Arch1	gartral	AOSS? or OSS?
2009-07-30T20:45:00.000Z	Arch1	gartral	And if you mean AOSS, what is that?
2009-07-30T20:48:00.000Z	gartral	Arch1	sorry for the wait, AOSS is the OSS <-> ALSA thing that helps connect devices too "pipes" i beilive.. anyway, you would find it useful too use sudo apt-get install aoss
2009-07-30T20:49:00.000Z	Arch1	gartral	It's showing no package labeled AOSS. Are you using some kind of extra software source?
2009-07-30T20:50:00.000Z	gartral	Arch1	its in normal packages.. hold on, i dont have the right package name
2009-07-30T20:51:00.000Z	gartral	Arch1	sudo aptitude install alsa-oss

2009-07-30T20:56:00.000Z	Arch1	gartral	Alsa-OSS is already installed. What now?
2009-07-30T21:05:00.000Z	gartral	Arch1	im not really sure then.. i know my computer hates ALSA and Pulse.. and only works with OSS.. soo.. *shrug*
