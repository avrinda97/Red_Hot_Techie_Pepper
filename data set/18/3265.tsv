2009-11-06T09:09:00.000Z	Amaranth	Lanphilo	Try ` sudo apt-get dist-upgrade`
2009-11-06T09:08:00.000Z	Lanphilo	Amaranth	thanks, will try..
2009-11-06T09:06:00.000Z	Amaranth	Lanphilo	sudo apt-get -f install
2009-11-06T09:06:00.000Z	Lanphilo	Amaranth	thanks :D
2009-11-06T09:07:00.000Z	Lanphilo	Amaranth	this is not working.. is it the only option?
2009-11-06T09:08:00.000Z	Amaranth	Lanphilo	Well if you try to install something else it'll also continue the previous download and install
2009-11-06T09:10:00.000Z	Lanphilo	Amaranth	will that continue my previous download?
2009-11-06T09:11:00.000Z	Amaranth	Lanphilo	it should, yes
2009-11-06T09:11:00.000Z	Lanphilo	Amaranth	it looks like performing a distribution upgrade, i think i lost 5 hrs of downloading
2009-11-06T09:11:00.000Z	Lanphilo	Amaranth	any ideas?
2009-11-06T09:11:00.000Z	Amaranth	Lanphilo	no, it'll definitely not download anything it already has
2009-11-06T09:13:00.000Z	Lanphilo	Amaranth	frostburn3, are those packages deleted?
2009-11-06T09:13:00.000Z	Amaranth	Lanphilo	If dist-upgrade is doing something then something needed to be done
2009-11-06T09:13:00.000Z	Amaranth	Lanphilo	I assumed a dist-upgrade is what you were doing though
2009-11-06T09:13:00.000Z	Amaranth	Lanphilo	You should have ran `sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop` to just get it installing that again
2009-11-06T09:14:00.000Z	Amaranth	Lanphilo	It'll keep the kubuntu-desktop packages around until the total it has downloaded gets over a certain size though
2009-11-06T09:14:00.000Z	Lanphilo	Amaranth	hmmm apparently the download is starting all over again
2009-11-06T09:16:00.000Z	Lanphilo	Amaranth	this is what i got when lost my connection "...  - connect (101: Network is unreachable) [IP: 91.189.88.31 80] E: Unable to fetch some archives, maybe run apt-get update or try with --fix-missing?"
