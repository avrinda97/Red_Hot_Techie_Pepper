2007-04-02T16:50:00.000Z	M3G4crux		I am having a problem with gnome panel
2007-04-02T16:50:00.000Z	M3G4crux		I have tried to solve it removing gnome dirs under home directory unsuccessfully
2007-04-02T16:51:00.000Z	M3G4crux		when gnome-panel runs it crashes continously
2007-04-02T16:51:00.000Z	M3G4crux		it pops a message saying something regarding gtkmanager.c
2007-04-02T16:52:00.000Z	M3G4crux		I close the message and it keeps on relaunching the gnome-panel and crashing. I have killed it from the terminal and launch it by had. I have removed gnome-panel and gnome-applets and gnome-session several times and installed again unsuccessfully
2007-04-02T16:53:00.000Z	thoreauputic	M3G4crux	does the same thing happen if you make a new userand log in as the new user?
2007-04-02T16:54:00.000Z	thoreauputic	M3G4crux	if so, I would move all the .gconf and .gnome* stuff and try again with a clean slate
2007-04-02T16:54:00.000Z	M3G4crux	thoreauputic	thats a pity. I can try it but i will not know the reason of the problem :(
2007-04-02T16:55:00.000Z	thoreauputic	M3G4crux	yes you will - you move things back until it breaks again
2007-04-02T16:55:00.000Z	thoreauputic	M3G4crux	that narrows it down to the bit you moved back :)
2007-04-02T16:55:00.000Z	thoreauputic	M3G4crux	 sudo adduer foo
2007-04-02T16:56:00.000Z	thoreauputic	M3G4crux	if you want the new user to be in various groups ( like audio etc) use adduser foo <name-of-group>
2007-04-02T16:57:00.000Z	thoreauputic	M3G4crux	after creating the user of course :)
2007-04-02T16:57:00.000Z	thoreauputic	M3G4crux	type id  or groups
2007-04-02T16:59:00.000Z	M3G4crux	thoreauputic	name of group one at a time?
2007-04-02T16:59:00.000Z	thoreauputic	M3G4crux	sudo adduser foo audio  for example
2007-04-02T05:00:00.000Z	thoreauputic	M3G4crux	yes, with adduser
