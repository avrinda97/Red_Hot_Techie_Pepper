2008-02-10T05:44:00.000Z	jrib	scrambledegg	the plugin does not exist on 64bit
2008-02-10T05:45:00.000Z	scrambledegg	jrib	really ?
2008-02-10T05:45:00.000Z	scrambledegg	jrib	not so sure about that
2008-02-10T05:46:00.000Z	jrib	scrambledegg	umm, ok?
2008-02-10T05:46:00.000Z	jrib	scrambledegg	check packages.ubuntu.com if you wish
2008-02-10T05:46:00.000Z	scrambledegg	jrib	he says he has the packages installed
2008-02-10T05:47:00.000Z	jrib	scrambledegg	then he is not using 64bit
2008-02-10T05:48:00.000Z	scrambledegg	jrib	sun-java6-bin is for amd64 i386
2008-02-10T05:48:00.000Z	jrib	scrambledegg	*plugin*
2008-02-10T05:48:00.000Z	scrambledegg	jrib	ya okay then but firefox usually works with 32bit bindings
2008-02-10T05:49:00.000Z	scrambledegg	jrib	i mean shared libraries
2008-02-10T05:49:00.000Z	jrib	scrambledegg	not by magic though :)
2008-02-10T05:49:00.000Z	scrambledegg	jrib	no by automaticz0r
2008-02-10T05:49:00.000Z	scrambledegg	jrib	or maybe not :)
2008-02-10T05:49:00.000Z	scrambledegg	jrib	nspluginwrapper is currently broken i think
2008-02-10T05:50:00.000Z	jrib	scrambledegg	:) I just wanted to make sure you understood the plugin package is not available on 64 bit so the you have to follow the !flash64 instructions.  I had to go through this
2008-02-10T05:51:00.000Z	scrambledegg	jrib	i really dont get why a plugin isnt crossplatform while the whole JVM is
2008-02-10T05:52:00.000Z	jrib	scrambledegg	blackdown java had a 64bit plugin.  The bug on sun's tracker is several years old.  They just don't care
