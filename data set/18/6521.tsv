2011-03-08T18:34:00.000Z	Fjodor	ljsoftnet	Have a look at /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2011-03-08T18:53:00.000Z	Fjodor	ljsoftnet	Have a look at /var/log/Xorg.0.log - as I said before
2011-03-08T18:54:00.000Z	ljsoftnet	Fjodor	in in Xorg.0.log but where can i find it, its a long page
2011-03-08T18:55:00.000Z	ljsoftnet	Fjodor	im in Xorg.0.log but where can i find it, its a long page
2011-03-08T18:55:00.000Z	Fjodor	ljsoftnet	Search for "Module class: X.Org Video Driver". It's a few lines above that
2011-03-08T18:58:00.000Z	ljsoftnet	Fjodor	there's two of them what should i look for?
2011-03-08T18:59:00.000Z	Fjodor	ljsoftnet	The second one
2011-03-08T19:00:00.000Z	ljsoftnet	Fjodor	is this the one im looking for         Module vesa: vendor="X.Org Foundation" compiled for 1.7.6, module version = 2.3.0
2011-03-08T19:01:00.000Z	Fjodor	ljsoftnet	Then that would mean that you are using the "vesa" driver
2011-03-08T19:01:00.000Z	ljsoftnet	Fjodor	is it a good driver?
2011-03-08T19:02:00.000Z	Fjodor	ljsoftnet	It's rather basic, but I don't really know which one you could use alternatively. I have only used nvidia and ati cards...
2011-03-08T19:02:00.000Z	Fjodor	ljsoftnet	You could try asking in #xorg
2011-03-08T19:03:00.000Z	ljsoftnet	Fjodor	ok thanks
2011-03-08T19:04:00.000Z	ljsoftnet	Fjodor	i did this code lspci -nn | grep vga          will it hurt my system?
2011-03-08T19:05:00.000Z	Fjodor	ljsoftnet	No, it merely lists what pci cards are in the system, and then limits the output to lines containg "VGA" - ie you graphics card
2011-03-08T19:05:00.000Z	ljsoftnet	Fjodor	ok thanks man
2011-03-08T19:05:00.000Z	Fjodor	ljsoftnet	No problem :-)
