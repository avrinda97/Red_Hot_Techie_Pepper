2011-11-23T20:32:00.000Z	Sanus		Okay
2011-11-23T20:32:00.000Z	Sanus		Back
2011-11-23T20:32:00.000Z	Sanus		Now,
2011-11-23T20:33:00.000Z	Sanus		I'm in 10.04... And I don't have a wireless manager.  Help.  :C
2011-11-23T20:33:00.000Z	Sanus		Uh, no.
2011-11-23T20:33:00.000Z	Sanus		Not if it's going to upgrade 10.04.
2011-11-23T20:33:00.000Z	Sanus		I just went through hoops to install 10.04.  I just need a wireless manager.
2011-11-23T20:33:00.000Z	linda	Sanus	You need what?
2011-11-23T20:34:00.000Z	Sanus	linda	A wireless manager.
2011-11-23T20:34:00.000Z	linda	Sanus	wicd
2011-11-23T20:34:00.000Z	Sanus	linda	I thought there were problems with wicd
2011-11-23T20:35:00.000Z	linda	Sanus	If you don't like what the normal network-manager is doing, install wicd.  I think you can have both but you can remove network-manager if you want.
2011-11-23T20:35:00.000Z	linda	Sanus	What problems?
2011-11-23T20:35:00.000Z	linda		Seems to work fine far as I can tell.
2011-11-23T20:35:00.000Z	Sanus	linda	Network-manager just doesn't seem to detect my net card.
2011-11-23T20:35:00.000Z	Sanus	linda	I'm guessing I'm going to require updating.
2011-11-23T20:37:00.000Z	linda		But you need to install wicd first.  i.e.  sudo apt-get install wicd ; sudo apt-get remove network-manager #And be sure not to skip the part where it asks if you want to add your user to netdev group.
2011-11-23T20:37:00.000Z	linda	Sanus	Yea, you will need to reboot.
