2012-09-08T04:46:00.000Z	WeThePeople	dr_willis	any ideas why midnight commander does this to files, http://imgh.us/geoip.jpg
2012-09-08T04:47:00.000Z	dr_willis	WeThePeople	 you are viewing the contents of a binary file - looks like to me.
2012-10-03T04:04:00.000Z	dr_willis	WeThePeople	 some use grub1 some use grub2.
2012-10-03T04:04:00.000Z	WeThePeople	dr_willis	besides that
2012-10-03T04:04:00.000Z	dr_willis	WeThePeople	 theres nothing stopping a disrto from doing weird stuff with grub
2012-10-20T02:46:00.000Z	dr_willis	WeThePeople	 theres numerous ways thats done. the locate command has a index that can be used.
2012-11-16T04:18:00.000Z	dr_willis	WeThePeople	 you mean the cd boots to some grub: prompt? or what exactly? i dont think the dvd uses grub.
2012-11-16T04:19:00.000Z	WeThePeople	dr_willis	i burned 12.10 to dvd a iso.. when i put dvd into bay and change the boot order, the computer doesnt boot to 12.10 it goes to my main grub menu
2012-11-16T04:20:00.000Z	dr_willis	WeThePeople	 how did you burn it to dvd? what files do you see on the dvd?
2012-11-16T04:24:00.000Z	dr_willis	WeThePeople	 you could have just said it has a single big iso file on it.. ;)  You burnt it wrong..
2012-11-16T04:24:00.000Z	WeThePeople	dr_willis	i did ??
2012-11-16T04:24:00.000Z	dr_willis	WeThePeople	 you need to burn it as an image, not a data file like you would do a bunch of jpegs ;)
