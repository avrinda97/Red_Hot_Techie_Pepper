2007-01-07T16:43:00.000Z	jazzrocker	killown	run alsoconf from the commandline?
2007-01-07T16:43:00.000Z	killown	jazzrocker	command not found
2007-01-07T16:44:00.000Z	jazzrocker	killown	lsmod (don't paste it)
2007-01-07T16:44:00.000Z	jazzrocker	killown	is alsa even linked into your kernel?
2007-01-07T16:46:00.000Z	killown	jazzrocker	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/785/
2007-01-07T16:49:00.000Z	jazzrocker	killown	yeah so it looks like you're running OSS instead of ALSA
2007-01-07T16:49:00.000Z	killown	jazzrocker	    but without sound
2007-01-08T17:08:00.000Z	jazzrocker	killown	with all ALSA modules up?
2007-01-08T17:08:00.000Z	jazzrocker	killown	last i saw you were using OSS, not ALSA... and what sound card do you have
2007-01-08T17:08:00.000Z	killown	jazzrocker	I not found command alsa-conf
2007-01-08T17:09:00.000Z	jazzrocker	killown	don't assume to know the answer to your question... alsaconf may or may not be the solution to your problem
2007-01-08T17:09:00.000Z	jazzrocker	killown	i'll ask you once more... what sound card do you have?
2007-01-08T17:10:00.000Z	jazzrocker	killown	wrong answer... let someone else help you, bye
2007-01-08T17:11:00.000Z	killown	jazzrocker	Multimedia audio controller: VIA Technologies, Inc. VT8233/A/8235/8237 AC97 Audio Controller (rev 60)
2007-01-08T17:11:00.000Z	jazzrocker	killown	ok that's better... it's a fairly standard chipset
2007-01-08T17:12:00.000Z	killown	jazzrocker	yes
2007-01-08T17:12:00.000Z	jazzrocker	killown	ok what are the various things you've done between yesterday and now
