2008-08-16T12:57:00.000Z	unop	zcat[1]_	linux can't, ntfsfix can tho
2008-08-16T13:21:00.000Z	unop	zcat[1]_	some removable devices require you run  "sudo eject" too after a "sudo umount" .. like ipods
2008-08-16T13:22:00.000Z	zcat[1]_	unop	Hmm.. wasn't aware of that!! Glad I didn't mess up any ipods becaise of that
2008-08-16T13:23:00.000Z	unop	zcat[1]_	the ipods however are quite smart, they can detect that you have manually ejected and will recover .. but i've seen my ipod hang if I don't use eject properly
2008-08-16T13:24:00.000Z	zcat[1]_	unop	Oh... if I right-click unmount/eject ubuntu is probably smart enough to know that.. I never unmounted an ipod from the command line so wasn't a problem..
2008-08-16T13:30:00.000Z	zcat[1]_	unop	as I understood.. /dev/sda is all NTFS with GRUB, /dev/sdb is ubuntu..
2008-08-16T13:31:00.000Z	unop	zcat[1]_	Vegombrei .. it should be as straight forward as formatting the 250G partition and allocating a mount-point .. the MBR should remain untouched, allowing linux to be booted .. but that depends on whether you use grub as the boot manager
2008-08-16T13:31:00.000Z	zcat[1]_	unop	also depends.. it would be 'nicer' to have the first drive be the install...
2008-08-16T13:32:00.000Z	unop	zcat[1]_	i don't think so, it really doesn't make a difference
2008-08-16T13:32:00.000Z	zcat[1]_	unop	well... asthetically ;)
2008-08-16T13:56:00.000Z	zcat[1]_	unop	I suspect mostly limited by it being a USB drive
2008-08-16T13:56:00.000Z	unop	zcat[1]_	and the compression tool and algorithm
2008-08-16T13:56:00.000Z	unop	zcat[1]_	which in turn depends on processing speeds too
2008-08-16T13:56:00.000Z	zcat[1]_	unop	depends where the bottleneck is
2008-08-16T13:57:00.000Z	unop	zcat[1]_	that's what i mean, the bottleneck could be anywhere .. there is no telling
2008-08-16T14:04:00.000Z	zcat[1]_	unop	and mounting it somewhere useful and removing the windows entry from grub
2008-08-16T14:06:00.000Z	unop	zcat[1]_	it is .. i don't see why it seems hard.
