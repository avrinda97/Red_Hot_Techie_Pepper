2009-08-01T10:44:00.000Z	Sp0d		if anyone can help me write a simple shell script please pm me :) thanks
2009-08-01T10:45:00.000Z	moymoy	Sp0d	just ask what you want
2009-08-01T10:48:00.000Z	moymoy	Sp0d	paste what you have so far on pastebin
2009-08-01T11:52:00.000Z	moymoy	Sp0d	put what you have so far on a pastebin and put the link up..
2009-08-01T11:53:00.000Z	moymoy	Sp0d	ahh i spot an error
2009-08-01T11:54:00.000Z	moymoy	Sp0d	i see what you did wrong
2009-08-01T11:56:00.000Z	moymoy	Sp0d	where you have the if [ blah ] lines... you use the variable "answer" but you entered it as "&answer" when it should be "$answer"
2009-08-01T12:00:00.000Z	Sp0d	moymoy	it still closes the script no matter which option i choose still.  I checked the system monitor and it didn't open the server and hid it either.  Thanks for the input though
2009-08-01T12:01:00.000Z	moymoy	Sp0d	are all the other scripts executable? chmod them?
2009-08-01T12:01:00.000Z	moymoy	Sp0d	okay.. i see another error
2009-08-01T12:02:00.000Z	moymoy	Sp0d	okay .. if you type in `whereis [` in the terminal, you'll find that it's its own command just like `if` or `mv` or anything else.. same thing applies for `]`
2009-08-01T12:03:00.000Z	moymoy	Sp0d	so at the end of `if [ "$answer" = "1"]` .. you need a space between the quote and ] .. so it should be `" ]` not `"]`
2009-08-01T12:04:00.000Z	moymoy	Sp0d	nope.. i like using the tickmarks as quotes when i type in stuff to IRC =p
2009-08-01T12:05:00.000Z	moymoy	Sp0d	if [ "$answer" = "1" ] ; then should work fine
2009-08-01T12:07:00.000Z	moymoy	Sp0d	got everything working?
2009-08-01T12:08:00.000Z	moymoy	Sp0d	no problem.. and scripts don't really need a .whatever extension
2009-08-01T12:09:00.000Z	moymoy	Sp0d	=p causes less confusion i suppose
2009-08-01T12:09:00.000Z	moymoy	Sp0d	and no problem =p
