2011-12-30T06:01:00.000Z	phiil_		errrr.... can i use ghost a laptop that runs ubuntu?
2011-12-30T06:02:00.000Z	reisio	phiil_	hrmm?
2011-12-30T06:05:00.000Z	phiil_	reisio	well when someone ghosts a computer i think that they competely copy the hard drive exactly to the other computer using a sata cable, is it possible to do that with a laptop when running ubuntu?
2011-12-30T06:05:00.000Z	reisio	phiil_	yes
2011-12-30T06:05:00.000Z	reisio	phiil_	you want to do it _to_ Ubuntu or _with_ Ubuntu?
2011-12-30T06:06:00.000Z	reisio	phiil_	yes, however
2011-12-30T06:06:00.000Z	reisio	phiil_	the Ubuntu OS itself is mirrored in thousands of places, so there's little reason to back it up, or make an image of it
2011-12-30T06:07:00.000Z	reisio	phiil_	it's more sensible to use to rsync to backup /home/
2011-12-30T06:08:00.000Z	reisio	phiil_	basically
2011-12-30T06:09:00.000Z	reisio	phiil_	it's basically just: rsync -av /home/ /mnt/some/other/place/home/
2011-12-30T06:09:00.000Z	reisio	phiil_	if it's interrupted, just re-run it, it'll skip things it's already copied
2011-12-30T06:10:00.000Z	phiil_	reisio	rsync cant make an iso image out  of an OS can it?
2011-12-30T06:10:00.000Z	reisio	phiil_	that isn't its purpose, no
2011-12-30T06:11:00.000Z	reisio	phiil_	you still want an image?
2011-12-30T06:11:00.000Z	reisio	phiil_	why?
2011-12-30T06:12:00.000Z	reisio	phiil_	...terrible? :p
2011-12-30T06:13:00.000Z	reisio	phiil_	an image of a device is an image of a device, the software shouldn't care what data is on it
2011-12-30T06:13:00.000Z	reisio	phiil_	but you'll be wasting your time I promise you
