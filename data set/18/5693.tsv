2008-11-02T08:52:00.000Z	spiritssight1		How do I connect two ubuntu system togeher so I can move files / setings from one system to the other
2008-11-02T08:53:00.000Z	rdw200169	spiritssight1	scp is way easy, and ubuntu has a simple way of doing it
2008-11-02T08:54:00.000Z	rdw200169	spiritssight1	please, try Places -> Connect to Server ....
2008-11-02T08:54:00.000Z	spiritssight1	rdw200169	 can you explain more please, both system is on the same network (router)
2008-11-02T08:54:00.000Z	rdw200169	spiritssight1	ok, simple; check it out: here's the case
2008-11-02T08:55:00.000Z	rdw200169	spiritssight1	2 computers; on a LAN, 192.168.0.0/24 for example
2008-11-02T08:55:00.000Z	rdw200169	spiritssight1	all you need to know is the ip of whatever computer you're trying to hop into, ubuntu-wise
2008-11-02T08:56:00.000Z	rdw200169	spiritssight1	now, what i'm talking about is related to ssh; so you need a password and running openssh server on each computer
2008-11-02T08:57:00.000Z	rdw200169	spiritssight1	i prefer it, once you set it up from Public -> connect to server, really similar to the way you would do it on a Mac; it becomes like a normal folder
2008-11-02T08:58:00.000Z	rdw200169	spiritssight1	on top of that, the connect to server thing does ftp, and windows, but those both require a little more configuration to get working right
2008-11-02T08:58:00.000Z	rdw200169	spiritssight1	ssh pretty much works right out of the box for filesharing
2008-11-02T08:59:00.000Z	rdw200169	spiritssight1	helpful?
2008-11-02T09:30:00.000Z	spiritssight1	rdw200169	 How can I tell smb to share all subfolders from the root
2008-11-02T09:31:00.000Z	rdw200169	spiritssight1	i'll be honest with you, i hate samba, and avoid it at all costs, so i can't tell you cause i don't know
2008-11-02T09:31:00.000Z	rdw200169	spiritssight1	i never use windows, so it's pretty easy for me to avoid it
2008-11-02T09:33:00.000Z	rdw200169	spiritssight1	like i said before, if you have access to both systems' passwords, openssh is the way to go
2008-11-02T09:33:00.000Z	rdw200169	spiritssight1	it's literally as easy as 'apt-get install openssh-server'
2008-11-02T09:34:00.000Z	spiritssight1	rdw200169	can you pm me I can not follow there is to much traffic for my eyes to follow what you are saying
