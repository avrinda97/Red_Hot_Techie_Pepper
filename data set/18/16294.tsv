2004-10-18T07:03:00.000Z	booger		sometimes your gnome panel will be running but not display
2004-10-18T07:04:00.000Z	booger		hmmm
2004-10-18T07:04:00.000Z	booger		let me see
2004-10-18T07:06:00.000Z	booger		try /usr/bin/gnome-panel
2004-10-18T07:06:00.000Z	booger		oh sorry
2004-10-18T07:06:00.000Z	booger		you probably want to listen to JG, I's still a noob myself
2004-10-18T07:07:00.000Z	booger		could someone give me a hand with my k3b issue?
2004-10-18T07:07:00.000Z	booger		FYI for other noobs, when I installed k3b using sudo I ran into errors
2004-10-18T07:08:00.000Z	booger		so I enabled the root account (Im' too used to having one) and reinstalled k3b
2004-10-18T07:08:00.000Z	booger		all of the errors went away, including the DCOP error
2004-10-18T07:08:00.000Z	jgeorgeson	booger	could be a permissions issue. i think i've read to run `sudo k3b` or `sudo k3bsetup` once first so that the permissions get set right
2004-10-18T07:10:00.000Z	jgeorgeson	booger	i don't do much cd burning in linux, so that's about as far as i can help
2004-10-18T07:33:00.000Z	jgeorgeson	booger	you mean icewm? `apt-get remove icewm; dpkg -P icewm` and I'm just guessing on the package name
2004-10-18T07:34:00.000Z	jgeorgeson	booger	when running as root?
2004-10-18T07:36:00.000Z	jgeorgeson	booger	have you checked the ubuntu bugzilla for k3b bugs? maybe you're hitting one none of us know about (seems not too many other people here use it)
2004-10-18T07:40:00.000Z	jgeorgeson	booger	y
2004-10-18T07:43:00.000Z	jgeorgeson	booger	the gnome CD ripping tool is sound-juicer
2004-10-18T07:50:00.000Z	jgeorgeson	booger	if there isn't a checkbox for it, then man nautilus-cd-burner
