2010-03-13T06:20:00.000Z	obiwan_		guys i read somewhere that running gdm as root or gnome-session could mess up some gnome config things and you had to remove or change permissions to some gnome dir in your home. could anybody refresh my memory? im searching about this and could find any discouragement to running it as sudo

2010-03-13T06:21:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	obiwan_	Theres no need to run gdm as root
2010-03-13T06:21:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	obiwan_	You need root commands done use sudo.
2010-03-13T06:24:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	obiwan_	if you start gdm from a TTY then it requires "sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start". But thats not saying that it runs with the root account.
2010-03-13T06:24:00.000Z	obiwan_	LinuxGuy2009	but what doesnt let me sleep is to know why they discouraged tu run it as root
2010-03-13T06:24:00.000Z	obiwan_	LinuxGuy2009	sudo run as root, i mean, they said dont run it with sudo
2010-03-13T06:24:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	obiwan_	root account is not needed in ubuntu. sudo or gksudo can run anything with root privledges.
2010-03-13T06:25:00.000Z	obiwan_	LinuxGuy2009	and it wants just because theres no need, its because it could mess up your system. and i wanna know why, why exactly does running gdm or gnome-session with sudo/as root breaks up your system
2010-03-13T06:26:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	obiwan_	Doing that in itself is no danger at all. The danger comes with the power that is given to the user. You can break things that a normal account user doesnt normally have access to do for good reasons.
2010-03-13T06:29:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	obiwan_	and unless you know what your doing root account isnt activated out of the box anyways. If you go looking for it and turn it on. Well then thats your own responsibility to know what goes along with that.
2010-03-13T06:31:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	obiwan_	Well you either knew or didnt. And you asked so I assumed you didnt. hehe
2010-03-13T06:32:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	obiwan_	OMG dude make your mind up. You either know this or you dont. We just explained this.
2010-03-13T06:34:00.000Z	obiwan_	LinuxGuy2009	i know i know hehe >)
2010-03-13T06:35:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	obiwan_	Only time you need permission to remove a file is if your not the owner.
2010-03-13T06:36:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	obiwan_	 If you login as root or use gksudo nautilus you can do whatever you want.
2010-03-13T06:38:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	obiwan_	Im just gonna ignore you now cause this is going nowhere fast.
2010-03-13T06:39:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	obiwan_	Try it and find out.
