2004-12-19T15:05:00.000Z	Nexinarus		How can i fix my mime types? Php files are inter-changed to html mime type and its really weird
2004-12-19T15:05:00.000Z	Nexinarus		if i make a php file with gedit and save it, it thinks its a html mime type
2004-12-19T15:06:00.000Z	Nexinarus		and highlights it as html. and naultilis browses the file as a html and wants to open it in firefox, which is wrong.
2004-12-19T15:06:00.000Z	Gwildor|Work	Nexinarus	what do you want it to open with?....you can change that in nautilis
2004-12-19T15:07:00.000Z	Nexinarus		gedit, but everything thinks php files are html files even though it ends in .php
2004-12-19T15:07:00.000Z	Nexinarus		so if i change the "open with" settings in nautilis, it changes html settings
2004-12-19T15:07:00.000Z	Gwildor|Work		im just saying that you can change what app it opens with
2004-12-19T15:08:00.000Z	Gwildor|Work	Nexinarus	click on it once.......then at the top bar...change the app
2004-12-19T15:08:00.000Z	Nexinarus		i know, ive done that,
2004-12-19T15:08:00.000Z	Nexinarus		but thats a hack and im looking for a proper fix
2004-12-19T15:11:00.000Z	Gwildor|Work	Nexinarus	oh....when i do that, it normaly becomes the default app for that file type......
2004-12-19T15:12:00.000Z	Nexinarus		same for me, but that changes html settings not php settings
2004-12-19T15:12:00.000Z	Nexinarus		i dont want to disturb html settings
2004-12-19T15:12:00.000Z	Gwildor|Work	Nexinarus	oh..i see, i have no idea then.......i dont know php.....sorry
2004-12-19T15:12:00.000Z	Gwildor|Work	Nexinarus	maybe it has something to do with the encoding?
2004-12-19T15:13:00.000Z	Nexinarus	Gwildor	yeah im thinking that
2004-12-19T15:13:00.000Z	Nexinarus		it thinks they are html encoded but i donno how to make it php encoding :S
2004-12-19T15:15:00.000Z	Gwildor|Work	Nexinarus	all i ever used for web design is adobe go-live, i may be able to figure it out there........but other than that.....idk
