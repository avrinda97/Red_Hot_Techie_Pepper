2010-06-03T20:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	obscurant1st	 try alt-f2  and run 'metacity --replace'
2010-06-03T20:59:00.000Z	obscurant1st	Dr_Willis	that si ple metacity command worked, but everytime i rebots my windows appear without the title bar, so should i include it in the start up programs?
2010-06-03T21:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	obscurant1st	  install the tool 'fusion-icon' and run it. and use it to select metacity as your window manager, OR right click ont he desktop, changewallpaper, -> last tab  (effects) -> Select NONE , that might get it all straightend out
