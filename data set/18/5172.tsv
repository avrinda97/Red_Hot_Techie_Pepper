2008-12-23T22:11:00.000Z	Fret18		hey
2008-12-23T22:11:00.000Z	Fret18		can someone help me with nVidia card?
2008-12-23T22:11:00.000Z	Fret18		ubuntu isn't recognizing it
2008-12-23T22:12:00.000Z	tiyowan	Fret18	What card are you using? And what visual problems are you experiencing?
2008-12-23T22:13:00.000Z	Fret18	tiyowan	I'm using XFX 5200 and, after a blackout, I turned computer on and ubuntu couldn't identify my graphics card.
2008-12-23T22:14:00.000Z	tiyowan	Fret18	Does your card show up in lspci?
2008-12-23T22:14:00.000Z	Fret18	tiyowan	I'll check, just a minute.
2008-12-23T22:15:00.000Z	Fret18	tiyowan	No, it doesn't show up.
2008-12-23T22:15:00.000Z	tiyowan	Fret18	I don't think that's a very good sign.
2008-12-23T22:16:00.000Z	Fret18	tiyowan	It worked for a little time when I reset xorg, but then it screw up again.
2008-12-23T22:16:00.000Z	tiyowan	Fret18	Personally, I'd open up the box, yank out the card and test it in a spare PC.
2008-12-23T22:17:00.000Z	Fret18	tiyowan	I installed Ubuntu through Wubi, so I tested the card in Windows and it works normally.
2008-12-23T22:19:00.000Z	tiyowan	Fret18	Perhaps some linux file got corrupted in the blackout?
2008-12-23T22:19:00.000Z	Fret18	tiyowan	Possibly. How could I fix it?
2008-12-23T22:21:00.000Z	tiyowan	Fret18	I'd trying reinstalling Ubuntu really.
2008-12-23T22:22:00.000Z	Fret18	tiyowan	Dang... OK, thanks for the help. :)
2008-12-23T22:22:00.000Z	tiyowan	Fret18	No worries, mate. Also, get a good UPS if you suffer from frequent power outages.
2008-12-23T22:23:00.000Z	Fret18	tiyowan	Fortunately, it's not frequent. Thanks again.
