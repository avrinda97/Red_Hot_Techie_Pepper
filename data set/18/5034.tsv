2010-07-11T01:46:00.000Z	duffydack	Petertatt	if you are using windows, get the windows installer
2010-07-11T01:47:00.000Z	duffydack	Petertatt	what package managers are for..
2010-07-11T01:48:00.000Z	duffydack	Petertatt	it doesnt get much easier than firing up software centre, typing in xchat and clicking install
2010-07-11T01:50:00.000Z	duffydack	Petertatt	you arent making any sense.   1 problem at a time, but you need to be using ubuntu before we can help you
2010-07-11T01:51:00.000Z	duffydack	Petertatt	are you still in windows vista?
2010-07-11T01:51:00.000Z	duffydack	Petertatt	xchat or irc will bring up options for download
2010-07-11T01:52:00.000Z	duffydack	Petertatt	xchat is there, clear to see.
2010-07-11T01:53:00.000Z	duffydack	Petertatt	for some things there will be the need to add a ppa to the repository list, but once thats done its just the same method of installing..
