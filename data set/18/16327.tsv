2004-10-07T12:56:00.000Z	euler		I mean, ubuntu shouldn't be touching the partitions boot record.
2004-10-07T12:57:00.000Z	euler		Some.
2004-10-07T12:58:00.000Z	euler		It's possible that the patch changed some things that affect both of those.
2004-10-07T13:00:00.000Z	euler		Since I don't use a synaptics touchpad, no, I haven't.
2004-10-07T13:00:00.000Z	euler		Yah, I was about to suggest that.
2004-10-07T13:00:00.000Z	dalderman	euler	no, but have you made a new kernel in Ubuntu at all?
2004-10-07T13:01:00.000Z	dalderman	euler	I was wondering if there was an issue with linux-source
2004-10-07T13:02:00.000Z	dalderman	euler	linux-source
2004-10-07T13:20:00.000Z	dalderman	euler	vim-gtk
2004-10-07T13:20:00.000Z	euler	dalderman	I did an apt-cache search for vim, and it didn't show up.
2004-10-07T13:21:00.000Z	dalderman	euler	are you using universe?
2004-10-07T13:21:00.000Z	dalderman	euler	then no, check your /etc/apt/sources.list
2004-10-07T13:22:00.000Z	euler	dalderman	Is universe the equivalent of unstable?
2004-10-07T13:22:00.000Z	dalderman	euler	in there are some lines commented out that have the universe stuff in, swap those lines round with the ones that are in use
2004-10-07T13:22:00.000Z	dalderman	euler	not sure, I think so
2004-10-07T13:22:00.000Z	dalderman	euler	might be testing
2004-10-07T13:23:00.000Z	dalderman	euler	I am still a bit of a Debian newbie myself
2004-10-07T13:40:00.000Z	dalderman	euler	Compuer -> Desktop Preferences -> keyboard shortcuts
