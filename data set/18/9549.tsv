2007-04-01T14:50:00.000Z	nexusvr		hi !
2007-04-01T14:51:00.000Z	nexusvr		what is the main difference between gdm and a window manager? May i use gdm for KDE too ?
2007-04-01T14:52:00.000Z	therealnanotube	nexusvr	gdm is just the thing that you see before you get into the window manager. you can use gdm with kde just as well as gnome.
2007-04-01T14:54:00.000Z	nexusvr	therealnanotube	so if i uninstall kdm i can still use KDE without it or will KDE lose some funcions (hmm...)
2007-04-01T14:54:00.000Z	therealnanotube	nexusvr	you have to change the config so that it uses gdm (as i recall, you can do that through dpkg-reconfigure, but i don't remember the details). so, not too good of an idea to just uninstall kdm without switching to gdm first. :)
2007-04-01T14:55:00.000Z	nexusvr	therealnanotube	dpkg-reconfigure gdm works great, thanks. LOL it's definitely not a good idea
2007-04-01T14:56:00.000Z	therealnanotube	nexusvr	glad it worked out :)
2007-04-01T15:03:00.000Z	nexusvr	therealnanotube	does thunar work good ?
2007-04-01T15:03:00.000Z	therealnanotube	nexusvr	yo :)
2007-04-01T15:03:00.000Z	therealnanotube	nexusvr	well, it works well enough. i have an edgy box with xfce, so i had a chance to play around with it a bit. it works. :)
2007-04-01T15:04:00.000Z	nexusvr	therealnanotube	Feisty here. XFCE works great but i have to study it (transparency? how??)
2007-04-01T15:05:00.000Z	therealnanotube	nexusvr	heh, i don't get into fancy stuff like transparency. i just want to do stuff on my comp. so don't know anything about that. :)
2007-04-01T15:06:00.000Z	nexusvr	therealnanotube	you are right. Work requires no fancyness (LOL) but i like to experiment, from time to time
2007-04-01T15:06:00.000Z	therealnanotube	nexusvr	hey, no problem with experimenting, i'm not saying you shouldn't. it's just that i don't really have time for it. :)
2007-04-01T15:08:00.000Z	nexusvr	therealnanotube	sorry i didn't mean it. Italy here (btw, we speak a litte strange sometimes...)
2007-04-01T15:08:00.000Z	therealnanotube	nexusvr	no problem man. io parlo poco italiano :)
2007-04-01T15:09:00.000Z	nexusvr	therealnanotube	np ;)
2007-04-01T15:32:00.000Z	therealnanotube	nexusvr	well, on dapper they are still on ff1.5, and will remain so. that's why i asked him what version of ubuntu he had. :)
