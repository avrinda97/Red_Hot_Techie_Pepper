2009-06-16T19:24:00.000Z	jasonmchristos		the same one that is installed by default on ubuntu please
2009-06-16T19:24:00.000Z	DSpair	jasonmchristos	There are a number of ways, but deciding depends on what you want to accomplish.
2009-06-16T19:24:00.000Z	jasonmchristos	DSpair	the same one that is on ubuntu
2009-06-16T19:24:00.000Z	DSpair	jasonmchristos	I don't know what you mean by that.
2009-06-16T19:25:00.000Z	jasonmchristos	DSpair	the one that is installed under ubuntu when u click enable remote desktop
2009-06-16T19:25:00.000Z	jasonmchristos	DSpair	under preferences in 9.04
2009-06-16T19:26:00.000Z	jasonmchristos	DSpair	i want this same one on my xubuntu
2009-06-16T19:27:00.000Z	DSpair	jasonmchristos	Aha. You should be able to use the same application in xubuntu. I believe it's called vino.
2009-06-16T19:27:00.000Z	jasonmchristos	DSpair	vino in synaptic?
2009-06-16T19:28:00.000Z	jasonmchristos	DSpair	i was trying xrdp apparently thtas not it
2009-06-16T19:28:00.000Z	jasonmchristos	DSpair	ill go try that now
2009-06-16T19:33:00.000Z	jasonmchristos	DSpair	still need a little help
2009-06-16T19:33:00.000Z	DSpair	jasonmchristos	Don't know how much assistance I can be, but shoot.
2009-06-16T19:34:00.000Z	jasonmchristos	DSpair	i installed the package but there is no remote desktop button under preferences
2009-06-16T19:34:00.000Z	DSpair	jasonmchristos	Try just running "vino" from the run dialog.
2009-06-16T19:34:00.000Z	jasonmchristos	DSpair	im guessing because xubuntu isnt using gnome
2009-06-16T19:36:00.000Z	jasonmchristos	DSpair	command not found
