2006-08-29T10:37:00.000Z	g333k_work		Can somebody helping me, to connect to another PC via ssh? I already created my dsa public key in the client PC, now whats the 2nd step?
2006-08-29T10:38:00.000Z	_azrael	g333k_work	ssh IPOFOTHERCOMPUTERHERE
2006-08-29T10:38:00.000Z	_azrael	g333k_work	and log in.
2006-08-29T10:38:00.000Z	g333k_work	_azrael	I'm doing $ssh user@192.168.1.2, and it asks me for a password, what password?
2006-08-29T10:39:00.000Z	_azrael	g333k_work	Your password on the remote box.
2006-08-29T10:39:00.000Z	g333k_work	_azrael	You mean the password of the user called "user" right?
2006-08-29T10:39:00.000Z	_azrael	g333k_work	Yes.
2006-08-29T10:40:00.000Z	_azrael	g333k_work	BUt it has to be "user"'s password from the computer you're trying to connect to, not the local password.
2006-08-29T10:41:00.000Z	g333k_work	_azrael	In the server PC I have a user called user01, and he has his password.. I'm using this password and this user to log on
2006-08-29T10:42:00.000Z	g333k_work	_azrael	I dont know whats happening then
2006-08-29T10:42:00.000Z	_azrael	g333k_work	Try making a new user on the server, just to make sure you're not just messing up password or something.
2006-08-29T10:43:00.000Z	g333k_work	_azrael	Intangir: I got it..... wrong case :$
2006-08-29T10:44:00.000Z	g333k_work	_azrael	22 here or in the remote PC (server) ?
2006-08-29T10:44:00.000Z	_azrael	g333k_work	22 remotely, but don't mess with it, you've got it setup now.
2006-08-29T10:45:00.000Z	g333k_work	_azrael	Intangir : Thanks
2006-08-29T10:47:00.000Z	g333k_work	_azrael	If I want to enter to that PC but using the X, is there a way using ssh? I think ssh -x ?
2006-08-29T10:48:00.000Z	_azrael	g333k_work	If you want to actually connect to the environment, I suggest instead sshing there, then executing "x11vnc"
2006-08-29T10:48:00.000Z	_azrael	g333k_work	Then vncing there.
