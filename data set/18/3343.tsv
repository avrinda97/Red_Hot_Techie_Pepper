2011-09-01T16:33:00.000Z	JoyFM		hey guys
2011-09-01T16:33:00.000Z	JoyFM		I got a little problem with a touchpad on an acer laptop
2011-09-01T16:33:00.000Z	JoyFM		it has a button to switch the touchpad on and off
2011-09-01T16:34:00.000Z	JoyFM		to get that button to work I needed that hack described here: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/374459/comments/68
2011-09-01T16:35:00.000Z	JoyFM		now the button is working but the funny thing is - if you log out (or restart or whatever) the computer while the touchpad is disabled it will work if gdm starts but stops working after the user has logged in
2011-09-01T16:36:00.000Z	JoyFM		you can fix that problem if you disable it in the login screen before login in
2011-09-01T16:37:00.000Z	JoyFM		also trying to enable it when logged in with the user with the command "synclient TouchpadOff=0" doesn't work
2011-09-01T16:37:00.000Z	JoyFM		so how does ubuntu/gnome store the touchpad settings and what could cause the corruption?
2011-09-01T16:37:00.000Z	Younder	JoyFM	now that is wierd
2011-09-01T16:37:00.000Z	JoyFM		yep
2011-09-01T16:38:00.000Z	JoyFM		it seems like the user setting and the general xsetting (which is that the touchpad is turned on from start) differ than it wont change the state anymore
2011-09-01T16:39:00.000Z	JoyFM		maybe SHMConfig would help?
2011-09-01T16:39:00.000Z	Younder	JoyFM	I will have to think about this one. will you send me your driver?
2011-09-01T16:39:00.000Z	JoyFM	Younder	what do you mean send you the driver?
2011-09-01T16:40:00.000Z	Younder	JoyFM	email it to jpthing@online.no
2011-09-01T16:40:00.000Z	JoyFM		it's ubuntu 10.10's standard synaptics driver
2011-09-01T16:41:00.000Z	Younder	JoyFM	no it aint
2011-09-01T16:43:00.000Z	JoyFM	Younder	I didn't change anything
