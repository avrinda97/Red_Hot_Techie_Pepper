2007-11-02T02:22:00.000Z	kinaole	burwaco	- is there an executable to  run?
2007-11-02T02:24:00.000Z	burwaco	kinaole	no, just klick on system > administration > update manager , and dist-upgrade should be there...
2007-11-02T02:26:00.000Z	kinaole	burwaco	- no joy ... I am running kubuntu, and the Adept Manager fails - adept updater say I am ready, but that I need to start the distribution upgrade tool
2007-11-02T02:27:00.000Z	burwaco	kinaole	man apt...
2007-11-02T02:28:00.000Z	kinaole	burwaco	- I am trying apt-get install -f
2007-11-02T02:29:00.000Z	burwaco	kinaole	you need to apt-get dist-upgrade, but I don't know if you have to change software channels manualy, maybe google for it first...
2007-11-02T02:29:00.000Z	kinaole	burwaco	- I left the gui version cooking when I went out this morning and a warning about debconf was hung when I got home
2007-11-02T02:30:00.000Z	kinaole	burwaco	- the gui changed my sources.list
2007-11-02T02:31:00.000Z	burwaco	kinaole	I would give sudo apt-get dist-upgrade a try, but yeah, I like to live dangerously... :-)
2007-11-02T02:32:00.000Z	burwaco	kinaole	less/etc/apt/sources.list, does it say gutsy or feisty ?
2007-11-02T02:32:00.000Z	kinaole	burwaco	- all gutsy
