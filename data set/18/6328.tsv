2009-10-06T20:17:00.000Z	hey`		hi, after an update, the screen resolution have changed, to 800 x 600, it's just look pretty much bigger than it was in my laptop.
2009-10-06T20:17:00.000Z	hey`		I don't know how to set it back, plus, it's diffcult to access the system configuration.
2009-10-06T20:18:00.000Z	hey`		nvidia geforce 7000 erusul
2009-10-06T20:18:00.000Z	hey`		it was an updage I've just made, it was neat just before.
2009-10-06T20:18:00.000Z	hey`		erusul, well through the automatic updates.
2009-10-06T20:18:00.000Z	hey`		I have the habit to install everything that comes in.
2009-10-06T20:19:00.000Z	hey`		eurusul, I didn't do anything, but installing the software updates ubuntu regularly gives.
2009-10-06T20:20:00.000Z	hey`		before this last update, I ended up like this.
2009-10-06T20:20:00.000Z	hey`		the problem is everything is so big I can't access the "system" button, to try to change to another resolution.
2009-10-06T20:21:00.000Z	hey`		is there a way to change the screen resolution through the terminal?
2009-10-06T20:21:00.000Z	ikonia	hey`	xrandr
2009-10-06T20:21:00.000Z	hey`		erusul I did'nt do the first installation :(
2009-10-06T20:22:00.000Z	hey`		erusul I think it was a kernel upgrade yes.
2009-10-06T20:22:00.000Z	hey`		ouch.... I don't know how to reinstall the drivers erusul.
2009-10-06T20:23:00.000Z	hey`		erusul, would it be a bad idea, if I just try to change the screen resolution?
2009-10-06T20:24:00.000Z	hey`	ikonia	would you give me an example of "xandr"?
2009-10-06T20:25:00.000Z	hey`		xrandr --> to something less bigger than 800 x 600
2009-10-06T20:25:00.000Z	ikonia	hey`	there are examples in man xrandr at the bottom
