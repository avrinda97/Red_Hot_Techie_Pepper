2005-07-22T10:31:00.000Z	firestorm		Hi. I've installed CUPS in Ubuntu but when I try adding a printer the username/password combo I try doesn't work. I've already typed lppasswd -a root  .. any hints?
2005-07-22T10:31:00.000Z	nickrud	firestorm	try using system-administration-printing
2005-07-22T10:32:00.000Z	nickrud	firestorm	top menu bar
2005-07-22T10:32:00.000Z	firestorm	nickrud	erm using KDE now....is there a Gnome command from a shell I can type?
2005-07-22T10:33:00.000Z	nickrud	firestorm	gnome-cups-manager
2005-07-22T10:35:00.000Z	firestorm	nickrud	desrt: excelelnt, been able to add a printer, print a test page with gnome-cups-manager....now, how can I set it up so that I could do the same with CUPS web interface?
2005-07-22T10:36:00.000Z	nickrud	firestorm	sudo adduser cupsys shadow, sudo invoke-rc.d cupsys restart, then go to localhost:631
2005-07-22T10:37:00.000Z	nickrud	firestorm	after you're done, sudo deluser cupsys shadow, sudo invoke-rc.d cupsys restart , for security
2005-07-22T10:38:00.000Z	firestorm	nickrud	ok, and what username/password do I use for the htaccess prompt at localhost:631/admin ?
2005-07-22T10:39:00.000Z	nickrud	firestorm	you need a root password to use a web admin tool
2005-07-22T10:41:00.000Z	firestorm	nickrud	I tried the root username/password but it didn't work
2005-07-22T10:44:00.000Z	firestorm	nickrud	and others: thanks, didn't realise ubuntu was root-passwordless
2005-07-22T10:44:00.000Z	nickrud	firestorm	if you really want to use the localhost:631 from the web, then do sudo passwd root , and create a root password
2005-07-22T10:46:00.000Z	firestorm	nickrud	If I've sudo passwd root then how can I later undo it to disable root login?
2005-07-22T10:47:00.000Z	firestorm	nickrud	sorry, found it in RootSudo wiki :)
2005-07-22T11:00:00.000Z	nickrud	firestorm	I had to walk away for a while, have you got your printer queue set up the way you want it?
2005-07-22T11:01:00.000Z	firestorm	nickrud	yup got it now...had to use CUPS so that I could give it a sane name though :)  And added 2 entries, one for b+w, another for colour...thansk for your perserverence!
