2009-03-05T22:53:00.000Z	Iceman_B^Ltop		anyone big on file permissions/ ownership? if a file belongs to User A1, group Spades, and user A1 is member is Spades, can I change file ownership to say, A1 and Hearts?
2009-03-05T22:53:00.000Z	Iceman_B^Ltop		where user A1 and Group Hearts are unrelated ?
2009-03-05T22:55:00.000Z	Jeruvy	Iceman_B^Ltop	sure, 'chown A1 Hearts /path/to/file (if I got that right...)
2009-03-05T22:56:00.000Z	Iceman_B^Ltop	Jeruvy	I know, but will that have any big ramifications for the file?
2009-03-05T22:57:00.000Z	Iceman_B^Ltop		or will it just be like the new group has access, PLUS one user?
2009-03-05T22:57:00.000Z	Iceman_B^Ltop		I assume that implcitly, a new file belongs to the user that created it and the group that THAT user belongs to
2009-03-05T22:57:00.000Z	Jeruvy	Iceman_B^Ltop	that simply adds the file group ownership to the group specified.  What kind of ramifications are you thinking of?
2009-03-05T22:58:00.000Z	Iceman_B^Ltop	Jeruvy	im simply trying to wrap my head around the file permissions/ownership system
2009-03-05T22:58:00.000Z	Iceman_B^Ltop		since im new to linux
2009-03-05T22:59:00.000Z	Iceman_B^Ltop		hehe, Windows "frags" your filesystem
