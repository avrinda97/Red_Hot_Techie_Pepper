2007-08-01T14:14:00.000Z	neverblue		decrease the number of services your running, that will increase boot time

2007-08-23T05:23:00.000Z	AncientRelic	neverblue	well Intel has Linux drivers on their site for it, but they're for SUSE, Fedora, and Mandrive
2007-08-23T05:23:00.000Z	neverblue	AncientRelic	and?
2007-08-23T05:23:00.000Z	neverblue	AncientRelic	im sure you can use the drivers already available
2007-08-23T05:24:00.000Z	AncientRelic	neverblue	they work at 800x600
2007-08-23T05:24:00.000Z	neverblue	AncientRelic	talk in #ubuntu-effects, they probably have had more experience with it
2007-08-23T05:24:00.000Z	neverblue	AncientRelic	which driver?
2007-08-23T05:26:00.000Z	neverblue	AncientRelic	cat /etc/X11/xorg.conf | grep driver
2007-08-23T05:26:00.000Z	AncientRelic	neverblue	give me a minute to check
2007-08-23T05:26:00.000Z	neverblue	AncientRelic	put that in a shell, and check the results
