2010-12-26T17:02:00.000Z	Stava		The indicator applet (tray icon menu) wont show me if I have a message or rss feed update in evolution (not even when evolution is active). Why is that?
2010-12-26T17:03:00.000Z	mongy	Stava	it only does it when its minimised or on another desktop
2010-12-26T17:04:00.000Z	Stava	mongy	it is on another desktop, and my inbox says that there are 2 unread messages
2010-12-26T17:04:00.000Z	Stava	mongy	but the tray icon or menu wont change
2010-12-26T17:04:00.000Z	mongy	Stava	checked the plugin settings in evo?
2010-12-26T17:04:00.000Z	Stava	mongy	Well its not only for the rss, its for email as well
2010-12-26T17:05:00.000Z	mongy	Stava	checked that evolution indicator plugin is active?
2010-12-26T17:05:00.000Z	Stava	mongy	it is
2010-12-26T17:07:00.000Z	Stava	mongy	I see evolution in the indicator, but it says my inbox is empty (0), while inside evolution its not empty (2)
2010-12-26T17:07:00.000Z	mongy	Stava	you see the icons in your panel, but is the plugin activated in evolution
2010-12-26T17:07:00.000Z	mongy	Stava	apart from that idk tbh
2010-12-26T17:08:00.000Z	Stava	mongy	Yeah its enabled and visible. The indicator menu will recognize my account (Personal), its just that it doesnt tell me if I have new messages or not, its always at 0
2010-12-26T17:09:00.000Z	mongy	Stava	and the mail notification plugin is setup correctly?
2010-12-26T17:10:00.000Z	Stava	mongy	Everything is as it was "out of the box"
2010-12-26T17:10:00.000Z	mongy	Stava	what version of  ubuntu
2010-12-26T17:10:00.000Z	Stava	mongy	10.10 desktop
2010-12-26T17:11:00.000Z	mongy	Stava	worked for me when I used it (i use gm-notify now)  try setting up your account again.. :|
