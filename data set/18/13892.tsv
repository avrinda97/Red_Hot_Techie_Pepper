2006-08-14T10:58:00.000Z	M06w		im trying to move my setup files from my firefox on windows to my firefox here and it says i dont have write permission to the firefox folder
2006-08-14T10:58:00.000Z	soundray	M06w	move them to the directory inside $HOME/.firefox/ instead
2006-08-14T10:58:00.000Z	soundray	M06w	there is a directory in there with a random name.
2006-08-14T10:59:00.000Z	soundray	M06w	just use it literally; enter 'cd $HOME/.firefox/default/'
2006-08-14T11:00:00.000Z	soundray	M06w	then enter ls and see what the random name is
2006-08-14T11:02:00.000Z	soundray	M06w	what happens when you type 'cd $HOME/.firefox/default' ?
2006-08-14T11:02:00.000Z	soundray	M06w	do you have a gnome desktop in front of you?
2006-08-14T11:03:00.000Z	soundray	M06w	have you got a terminal window open?
2006-08-14T11:03:00.000Z	soundray	M06w	open one, then.
2006-08-14T11:04:00.000Z	soundray	M06w	okay, you can do it your way, of course, but I won't help you.
2006-08-14T11:23:00.000Z	soundray	M06w	it is a protection measure that not only helps to protect you from your own mistakes, but also from cracker attacks.
2006-08-14T11:23:00.000Z	soundray	M06w	if you really want to be helped, I suggest you try to be slightly less obtuse.
2006-08-14T11:24:00.000Z	soundray	M06w	the way things work in ubuntu may be different from the ways you are used to. That doesn't mean that anything is wrong with the ubuntu way, though.
2006-08-14T11:25:00.000Z	soundray	M06w	watch your language and keep this channel family friendly.
