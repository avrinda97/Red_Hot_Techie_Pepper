2006-03-17T12:19:00.000Z	vladuz976		anybody know if there are iso for i686 or k7?
2006-03-17T12:21:00.000Z	vladuz976		the 64 bit edition of ubuntu, does it use 64 bit packages only?
2006-03-17T12:23:00.000Z	Half-Left	vladuz976	that processor will be fine in the 32bit version
2006-03-17T12:24:00.000Z	vladuz976	Half-Left	it's a crappy processor though, isn't it?
2006-03-17T12:24:00.000Z	Half-Left	vladuz976	why would it be?
2006-03-17T12:25:00.000Z	vladuz976	Half-Left	i dunno, that's just what i heard from some people, but that's all i can afford
2006-03-17T12:25:00.000Z	Half-Left	vladuz976	sound good to me
2006-03-17T12:26:00.000Z	Half-Left	vladuz976	look on tomshardware.com and look for a review
2006-03-17T12:26:00.000Z	vladuz976	Half-Left	thanks
2006-03-17T12:27:00.000Z	Half-Left	vladuz976	A athlon64 will fly in a 32bit distro so dont worry about it
2006-03-17T12:27:00.000Z	vladuz976	Half-Left	yeah but that's an athlon, i am talking about a turion
2006-03-17T12:28:00.000Z	Half-Left	vladuz976	I assume thats the mobile version by it's name
2006-03-17T12:29:00.000Z	vladuz976	Half-Left	if that's the only differnce, then i guess there's no worries, i thought it's like the celeron of the intels
2006-03-17T12:29:00.000Z	Half-Left	vladuz976	no, I dont think so somehow, AMD dont do things like that :-)
2006-03-17T12:31:00.000Z	Half-Left	vladuz976	i'm pretty sure it would piss my athlonxp 2600+ and my system is fast so
2006-03-17T12:32:00.000Z	vladuz976	Half-Left	i guess it'll be ok too, i was just worried coz i do wanna compile large stuff from time to time and on a laptop i didn't know how it will be
2006-03-17T12:35:00.000Z	Half-Left	vladuz976	you'll be fine
2006-03-17T12:40:00.000Z	Half-Left	vladuz976	 I cannot find a Turon64 review anywhere on tomshardware :-o
