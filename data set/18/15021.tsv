2005-05-19T07:25:00.000Z	nopea	Deffie	somtimes gphpedit crashes
2005-05-19T07:27:00.000Z	Deffie	nopea	i dont know gphpedit, try to figure if the files you found have been edited eith gphpedit
2005-05-19T07:29:00.000Z	Deffie	nopea	they arent displayed from the gui because gnome filemanager recognizes them as backups, maybe theres an option in preferences or in gconf

2005-05-19T07:30:00.000Z	nopea	Deffie	yes you are right its a setting in the File Managment pref.
2005-05-19T07:31:00.000Z	Deffie	nopea	and maybe the editors too have some option regarding the creation of them
