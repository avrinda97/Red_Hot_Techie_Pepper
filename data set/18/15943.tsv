2004-12-22T07:18:00.000Z	farruinn	defunkt	just go to the terminal and enter what crimsun said
2004-12-23T13:44:00.000Z	farruinn	defunkt	generally if you should install stuff via apt if you can.  apt-cache search ttf will give you a list of tons of fonts
2004-12-23T14:11:00.000Z	farruinn	defunkt	what do you use for web design?
2004-12-23T14:13:00.000Z	farruinn	defunkt	have you tried killing esd before playing the game?
2004-12-23T14:14:00.000Z	defunkt	farruinn	what do you mean
2004-12-23T14:14:00.000Z	farruinn	defunkt	that's the enlightened sound daemon, I've found it to interfere with some game audio
2004-12-23T14:15:00.000Z	farruinn	defunkt	at the terminal type killall esd
2004-12-23T14:16:00.000Z	defunkt	farruinn	nothing
