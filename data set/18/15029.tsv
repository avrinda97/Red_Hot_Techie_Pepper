2005-05-16T11:04:00.000Z	anathema		a lot of the themes on themes.org for gtk 1 and 2....when i drag/drop them or try installing..it says invalid file format..shouldnt these work ?
2005-05-16T11:05:00.000Z	sysrq	anathema	probably because they are in a tarball, you will have to extract them first
2005-05-16T11:08:00.000Z	sysrq	anathema	maybe it's a theme engine and not just a theme?
2005-05-16T11:10:00.000Z	sysrq	anathema	no gtkrc files in the archive?
2005-05-16T11:11:00.000Z	sysrq	anathema	just extract it in ~/.themes/ and include the gtkrc it in your ~/.gtkrc(-2.0)
2005-05-16T11:11:00.000Z	anathema	sysrq	ok do i extract the .png's directly or put them in a directory?
2005-05-16T11:12:00.000Z	sysrq	anathema	just extract the archive, keep the directory structure
2005-05-16T11:12:00.000Z	anathema	sysrq	can i PM you? too much talking heheh
2005-05-16T11:13:00.000Z	sysrq	anathema	yes
