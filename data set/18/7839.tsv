2007-11-19T10:34:00.000Z	Peddy	BigDaddy	I know, but I'll send a screenie of my problem. Slightly worse, to say the least. Just fyi I've purged and reinstalled several times.

2007-11-19T10:48:00.000Z	BigDaddy	Peddy	how about plugin's? What plugin's are you using?
2007-11-19T10:48:00.000Z	Peddy	BigDaddy	Excellent thought. I am disabling all of them right now.
