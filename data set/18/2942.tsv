2011-02-06T06:43:00.000Z	lighta		but hobbes I don't get it. You only "need" space on your new pc for the iso, the time you put it on your usb right ? then your old pc can boot with this everytime if you want, just have to set it permanent
2011-02-06T06:44:00.000Z	lighta		I did it with unetbootin recently you need your usb to be on fat32 to boot in
2011-02-06T06:46:00.000Z	lighta		here what I'll do if you really don't have any space anywhere, plug 2 usb, take an iso from net on usb1, use a usb creator program to set it permanent on usb2 and boot your pc permanntly with usb2 or if you have enought space (can be like 300mb mini) install it
2011-02-06T06:48:00.000Z	lighta		yes hobbes installation software let you format your target partition on system you want, ext4, ext3, ext2, ntfs? e I dont remenber, swap
2011-02-06T06:49:00.000Z	lighta		ext4
2011-02-06T06:49:00.000Z	lighta		faster
2011-02-06T06:49:00.000Z	lighta		for OS
2011-02-06T06:50:00.000Z	lighta		well really depend on your use I'd say hobbes, I don't think i'm wrong saying you could install it on all, but ext4 isn't easy readable for windows, I think ext2 is the most supported from windows
2011-02-06T06:51:00.000Z	lighta		yes install windows before linux is recommmanded just because of grub, if you doit on other way, dosgrub do usually something bad with your linux grub and you can't boot on linux again :(
2011-02-06T06:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lighta	microsoft are ignorant and havent coded in anything access except FAT and NTFS based filesystems
2011-02-06T06:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lighta	the definitions of the data structure is freely available too so they don't even need to exert too much effort
2011-02-06T06:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lighta	with a 3rd party app you can read ext2 and ext3
2011-02-06T06:56:00.000Z	lighta	ActionParsnip	do you have some for ext4, the one I had for ext3 wasn't working right
2011-02-06T06:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lighta	not as far as I know, i believe the guys at fs-driver.org are in progress but I don't use a dual boot
2011-05-13T04:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lighta	does it not obey ~/.bashrc
