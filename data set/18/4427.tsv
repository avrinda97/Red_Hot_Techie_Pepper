2011-05-25T07:18:00.000Z	SuperFireLord42	celthunder	he wants to know if he should dl 32bit or 64 bit, he said something about removing 3GB of ram to get it to work and running Ubuntu 5.1
2011-05-25T07:22:00.000Z	celthunder	SuperFireLord42	the video card is 1 line...not over 3
2011-05-25T07:22:00.000Z	SuperFireLord42	celthunder	yes but lspci is over 3
2011-05-25T07:22:00.000Z	celthunder	SuperFireLord42	oops sorry i'm reading several lines behind here
2011-05-25T07:22:00.000Z	SuperFireLord42	celthunder	no prob, my client is lagging
2011-05-25T07:31:00.000Z	SuperFireLord42	celthunder	it sounds like the reset he did on the board did not work right. imho, thats why i was thinking of flashing it
2011-05-25T07:32:00.000Z	celthunder	SuperFireLord42	he can't make up his mind one minute the ram doens't work at all the next windows ran fine with the ram in...either it turns on or it doesn't....
2011-05-25T07:33:00.000Z	SuperFireLord42	celthunder	i still wonder if the old ubuntu he has is too old to handle the ram? i thought the older kernels had a 4GB limit, then again, i am not faimilar with 5.1
2011-05-25T07:33:00.000Z	celthunder	SuperFireLord42	probably lol
2011-05-25T07:34:00.000Z	celthunder	SuperFireLord42	yeah
2011-05-25T07:34:00.000Z	celthunder	SuperFireLord42	what i'm wondering is why he's on a version from like 7 years ago
2011-05-25T07:35:00.000Z	SuperFireLord42	celthunder	i think the best bet is he just needs to put 11.04 on it and then we see what to do.
2011-05-25T07:36:00.000Z	SuperFireLord42	celthunder	and wallrace i know nothing about 2wires.
2011-05-25T07:37:00.000Z	celthunder	SuperFireLord42	wallrace 2wires FAIL...with that said...it should have port forwarding/dmz abilities check portforward.com and then just replace the game port with 22
2011-05-25T07:38:00.000Z	celthunder	SuperFireLord42	wallrace did you try that site and seeing if it had the 2wire model listed or try a similar model name and just clickon a random app replace the port with 22
2011-05-25T07:39:00.000Z	SuperFireLord42	celthunder	looking at it now actually :P
2011-05-25T07:39:00.000Z	celthunder	SuperFireLord42	pm?
2011-05-25T07:39:00.000Z	SuperFireLord42	celthunder	go ahead, if this client will support it :P
