2008-01-04T13:05:00.000Z	wols	francis	whoever tries to send the mail, is that host in the same network?
2008-01-04T13:06:00.000Z	francis	wols	no the clients are in a different network !! the server2 is at the datacenter
2008-01-04T13:06:00.000Z	wols	francis	your mynetworks= setting is either wrong or probably doesn't have all needed networks
2008-01-04T13:06:00.000Z	wols	francis	you will need SMTPD auth then
2008-01-04T13:07:00.000Z	francis	wols	give me a minute . shall look up mynetwork
2008-01-04T13:09:00.000Z	wols	francis	since you're trying to send via the MTA from outside it's network, smtpd auth is the only sensible choice
2008-01-04T13:09:00.000Z	francis	wols	 yea  i was just coming to that
