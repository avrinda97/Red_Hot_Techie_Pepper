2008-10-25T12:09:00.000Z	rob__		hey guys.  i'm a freelance developer.  i run an ubuntu server out of my house.  im having a hell of a time trying to get sendmail working.  i'm assuming this has something to do wth a combination of my isp blocking ports and my server not having a domain name pointing to it.  is there any way for me to get this going?
2008-10-25T12:10:00.000Z	rob__		i'd really like to get it going for development purposes
2008-10-25T12:10:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	rob__	who's your ISP?
2008-10-25T12:10:00.000Z	rob__		road runner
2008-10-25T12:10:00.000Z	rob__		im also running dd-wrt firmware on my linksys router
2008-10-25T12:10:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	rob__	not familiar with them.. Are they a cable provider?
2008-10-25T12:11:00.000Z	rob__		yes
2008-10-25T12:11:00.000Z	rob__		time warner cable
2008-10-25T12:11:00.000Z	rob__		a 'smarthost'?
2008-10-25T12:11:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	rob__	they most likely block the outgoing smtp ports or require authentication. have you tried calling them about it?
2008-10-25T12:11:00.000Z	rob__		can sendmail be configured this way?
2008-10-25T12:11:00.000Z	rob__		no, i haven't contacted them
2008-10-25T12:12:00.000Z	rob__		is that my best option?
2008-10-25T12:12:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	rob__	sendmail would have to be configured that way. Unless you provide your own internet service your going to have to use someone's smtp ports
2008-10-25T12:13:00.000Z	rob__	Stupendoussteve	thank i saw that link but im not using postfix, im using sendmail
2008-10-25T12:13:00.000Z	rob__		does this make a different
2008-10-25T12:13:00.000Z	rob__		<--- total n00b
2008-10-25T12:14:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	rob__	even though you want to use this as "development or testing" you might be breaking your ISP agreement by setting such a server up. I wouldnt want to see you get in trouble for this, so I would advise you speak with your ISP on the matter. I believe this has something to do with the patriot act (logging ISP of all people sending e-mails) something about spammers
