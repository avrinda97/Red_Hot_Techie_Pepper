2008-10-19T12:35:00.000Z	sorsis	jp91	is it just with video, not with other applications?
2008-10-19T12:36:00.000Z	jp91	sorsis	it's everything
2008-10-19T12:36:00.000Z	sorsis	jp91	are you using CRT?
2008-10-19T12:36:00.000Z	jp91	sorsis	i think so, it's a big bulky crt with a flat screen
2008-10-19T12:37:00.000Z	sorsis	jp91	is it only in linux or is it also in other operating systems? could it be that you screen is a bit old and problem is hardware related?
2008-10-19T12:38:00.000Z	jp91	sorsis	no it was very clear in xp
2008-10-19T12:38:00.000Z	sorsis	jp91	have you tried same resolution, refreshrate and color bitrate settings as you are using in windows?
2008-10-19T12:39:00.000Z	jp91	sorsis	in monitor resolution settings it says unknown, but it's set to the native resolution but i'm not sure what the resolution is
2008-10-19T12:40:00.000Z	jp91	sorsis	when i press the menu button on the front of the monitor it says 87hz but there is no option for 87hz in the resolution settings in ubuntu
2008-10-19T12:42:00.000Z	jp91	sorsis	it seems like the refresh rate is wrong but it only gives me one option and it says monitor unknown
2008-10-19T12:42:00.000Z	sorsis	jp91	your problem seems quite surreal since afaik old screens should get blurry from the sides and be quite sharp from the midle.
2008-10-19T12:43:00.000Z	jp91	sorsis	i don't think the driver ubuntu is using for this computer is the right one
2008-10-19T12:44:00.000Z	jp91	sorsis	i had this same problem on a newer machine that had an nvidia card and the screen was blurry until i installed the nvidia drivers
2008-10-19T13:11:00.000Z	sorsis	jp91	read /etc/xorg.conf to compare display settings and find the difference.
2008-10-19T13:11:00.000Z	sorsis	jp91	are you sure that you sreen is fine with those resolutions in windows?
2008-10-19T13:12:00.000Z	jp91	sorsis	yes, and this monitor is clear hooked up to my laptop also
2008-10-19T13:13:00.000Z	sorsis	jp91	i think that you display device has to be tweaked to remember some sreen sharpnes settings for your wanted resolution, refresrate and bitrate setting.
