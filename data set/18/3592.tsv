No need to tell it about windows, it will sense it and add it to GRUB as a selection when booting
2009-09-08T11:22:00.000Z	valley	syntex	you have to make sure every partition is delected except for the xp partition when you start with the ubuntu installer
2009-09-08T11:22:00.000Z	syntex	valley	So, I don't do any partioning in xp. I do it all in Ubuntu?
2009-09-08T11:23:00.000Z	valley	syntex	yes, except for telling xp to make it's own partition
2009-09-08T11:23:00.000Z	valley	syntex	the rest should be UNPARTITIONED
2009-09-08T11:24:00.000Z	syntex	valley	Ah okay. What option do I choose when installing Ubuntu to assign it to the unpartitioned space?
2009-09-08T11:25:00.000Z	valley	syntex	I usually do the manual paritition management. Tell it to make 2 gigabyes of SWAP in a partition. Then tell it to use the rest of the free space for an ext3 parition
2009-09-08T11:26:00.000Z	valley	syntex	I'm confident that telling it to use automatically use the free space though would work
2009-09-08T11:26:00.000Z	valley	syntex	A benifit of doing it manually though is the option of using EXT4 instead of ext3
2009-09-08T11:26:00.000Z	syntex	valley	So when doing it manually, I can select the Unportitioned space? Will it be hd0,1? Or something like that?
2009-09-08T11:27:00.000Z	syntex	valley	Sorry, I'm very new to Linux and I'm not too familiar with the way Linux works.
2009-09-08T11:27:00.000Z	valley	syntex	It is done graphically I believe: you don"t need to know about hd0,1 or anything
2009-09-08T11:28:00.000Z	syntex	valley	Thank you very much. :)
2009-09-08T11:28:00.000Z	valley	syntex	I was in your shoes about a year ago; you have my appreciation though; I wish more people would take the steps you are taking
2009-09-08T11:29:00.000Z	syntex	valley	Thank you. I didn't actually know how user friendly linux was until I did an Install of openSUSE 10 at tafe. Then, I decided to try it out at home.:)
2009-09-08T11:30:00.000Z	valley	syntex	I started with openSUSE as well, then moved to Ubuntu; Since then I've gone through more than I care to list; Ubuntu is still my favorite for ease of use
2009-09-08T11:32:00.000Z	syntex	valley	I actually liked openSUSE and loved how snappy it was in comparison to XP. After that didn't install on my home system for some reason, I did some research and narrowed it down to Ubuntu or Mint.
2009-09-08T11:33:00.000Z	syntex	valley	Thank you for all your help. I'm going to go and attempt to dual-boot my system for a 2nd time. :)
