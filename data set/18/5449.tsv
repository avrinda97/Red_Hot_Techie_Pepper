2009-08-09T10:05:00.000Z	kandjar		come to think of it; i m thinking about switching back to 8.10... to many new issue with 9.04 :(
2009-08-09T10:06:00.000Z	kandjar		including: video now working inside firefox... bluetooth not working at all!
2009-08-09T10:07:00.000Z	losher	kandjar	I went back to 8.04 LTS
2009-08-09T10:07:00.000Z	kandjar	losher	u had issue too?
2009-08-09T10:08:00.000Z	losher	kandjar	the same ones everyone else has: sound, flash, ext4, other odd things not working the same. For no other significant benefit....
2009-08-09T10:08:00.000Z	kandjar	losher	I should probably do that too... I can't remember if the wpa-psk was working by default with 8.04
2009-08-09T10:08:00.000Z	kandjar	losher	oh i see...
2009-08-09T10:09:00.000Z	kandjar	losher	well it's decided then back to at 8.04 lts or 8.10
2009-08-09T10:11:00.000Z	kandjar	losher	it's king of a shame; i decided to switch to 9.04 coz with 8.10 eveyrthing was fine until I install one of the recommanded upgrade and then... no more sound... or more precisely; it's was working on time to time and mostly not working at all
2009-08-09T10:12:00.000Z	losher	kandjar	I've been seeing complaints about intermittent sound on this channel since 9.04 came out, with no consensus for a solution. Apparently the developers can't fix it either...
2009-08-09T10:13:00.000Z	kandjar	losher	doh :(
2009-08-09T10:14:00.000Z	kandjar	losher	so they f.. it up and can't even roll back :( tsss
2009-08-09T10:15:00.000Z	losher	kandjar	9.04 appears to have been rushed out the door without enough QA. Followed by a lot of denial...
2009-08-09T10:16:00.000Z	kandjar	losher	no good ... you end up with a lot of bad publicity...
2009-08-09T10:17:00.000Z	kandjar	losher	the sound issue i had it with 8.10... thinking of it; i ll definitively try 8.04 again hoping hte wireless will be working properly.. it's a pain to manually set it up
2009-08-09T10:22:00.000Z	kandjar	losher	are you using a wifi connection? with 6.04?
2009-08-09T10:23:00.000Z	losher	kandjar	I use wifi with 8.04, but that doesn't guarantee you can. It depends almost entirely on which wifi card you have, and if there are drivers available for it...
