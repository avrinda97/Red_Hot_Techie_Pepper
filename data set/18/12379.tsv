2006-11-10T17:05:00.000Z	coz_	wilddragon	need a little more ingo
2006-11-10T17:08:00.000Z	coz_	wilddragon	grub should have been installed when you installed ubuntu, Ubuntu must be installed LAST after windows
2006-11-10T17:09:00.000Z	coz_	wilddragon	you have to install windows or any other os BEFORE you instll ubuntu, that wasy grub will pick up on the other OS's you have and when you boot you will get a menu to choose which OS you want to boot into
2006-11-10T17:10:00.000Z	coz_	wilddragon	ok and did you install edubuntu as workstation?
2006-11-10T17:11:00.000Z	coz_	wilddragon	well I havn't tried edubuntu as a client install, so i have no idea if grub is installed during that process, however, the worksation install I believe does install grub, perhaps someone here wouold know if that is true
2006-11-10T17:13:00.000Z	coz_	wilddragon	someone here can help with that
2006-11-10T17:15:00.000Z	coz_	wilddragon	well ididn't give too much info but i hope things work out, I also have used edubuntu and find it is a real great version
