2006-07-14T05:52:00.000Z	wheel		i'll bet nobody knows how to add downloads to the installer. typical.
2006-07-14T05:53:00.000Z	ardchoille	wheel	Huh?
2006-07-14T05:54:00.000Z	wheel	ardchoille	how do i add downloads to the installer? know the syntax? :)
2006-07-14T05:54:00.000Z	ardchoille	wheel	You mean Synaptic?
2006-07-14T05:55:00.000Z	wheel	ardchoille	anyhow!!!! i have an archive folder with uninstalled debs. i need to have the installer acknowledge it, and add it to the install list. any ideas? :)
2006-07-14T05:56:00.000Z	ardchoille	wheel	you don't add apps to the installer. You add repos to the list of repos the installer uses. The apps are added in the repos and their server is responsible for that stuff.
2006-07-14T05:58:00.000Z	wheel	ardchoille	update list in the installer? it Does_not_Freaking work for archive files.
2006-07-14T05:59:00.000Z	ardchoille	wheel	you have packages on a disk or something? You can use dpkg to install those.
2006-07-14T06:00:00.000Z	wheel	ardchoille	do you know the dpkg syntax? i tried it before and it failed to see the individual programs because there was no list. i tried to generate a list, and that failed.
2006-07-14T06:01:00.000Z	ardchoille	wheel	Yes, it's:  sudo dpkg -i file.deb
2006-07-14T06:02:00.000Z	wheel	ardchoille	so. i first enter the folder. go, sudo dpkg -i file -- and that's all i need to do?
2006-07-14T06:02:00.000Z	ardchoille	wheel	If you have a dir full of .debs and you know you want to install them all, you can do:  sudo dpkg -i /path/dir/*.deb
2006-07-14T06:03:00.000Z	wheel	ardchoille	thank you very much!!! let me give it a shot!!! thanks!!! :)
2006-07-14T06:03:00.000Z	ardchoille	wheel	You're welcome :)
2006-07-14T06:04:00.000Z	wheel	ardchoille	thanks. :)
2006-07-14T06:38:00.000Z	ardchoille	wheel	I don't think that would work because normal directories aren't setup with the files needed to make it a repo
2006-07-14T06:39:00.000Z	wheel	ardchoille	this is soooooo stoooopid. i mean, the whole deal. i'm tiring fast. my god, doesn't debian have a useful syntax? is it applicable for ubuntu?
