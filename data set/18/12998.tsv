2008-10-23T12:32:00.000Z	J-_		http://pastebin.com/m3fbb79f0 Does that look right?
2008-10-23T12:33:00.000Z	blue-frog	J-_	do you resolve names correctly?
2008-10-23T12:33:00.000Z	J-_	blue-frog	 no
2008-10-23T12:34:00.000Z	blue-frog	J-_	you give nameservers names instead of IP.
2008-10-23T12:34:00.000Z	blue-frog	J-_	so you are trying to resolve names for the nameserver itself
2008-10-23T12:34:00.000Z	blue-frog	J-_	while your machine doesn't know where to resolve names. dog bites its tail
2008-10-23T12:35:00.000Z	J-_	blue-frog	 so the DNS entries should have my server's name?
2008-10-23T12:35:00.000Z	blue-frog	J-_	IP not names
2008-10-23T12:36:00.000Z	blue-frog	J-_	except if your DNS server is your aown machine eventually
2008-10-23T12:37:00.000Z	J-_	blue-frog	 The DNS I'm using is from afraid.org.
2008-10-23T12:37:00.000Z	J-_		Now I'm really confused.
2008-10-23T12:37:00.000Z	blue-frog	J-_	is your own physical machine you are on right now your DNS server?
2008-10-23T12:38:00.000Z	J-_	blue-frog	 My own LAMP server, and I'm using afraid.org's DNS.
2008-10-23T12:38:00.000Z	blue-frog	J-_	resolv.conf > nameserver 67.19.72.206
2008-10-23T12:39:00.000Z	J-_	blue-frog	 where does the IP point to?
2008-10-23T12:41:00.000Z	blue-frog	J-_	your dns
2008-10-23T12:45:00.000Z	J-_	blue-frog	 Doesn't work.
2008-10-23T12:47:00.000Z	blue-frog	J-_	I don't know what you are doing. 67.19.72.206 (ns1.afraid.org) do not respond t ping. Is it alive and kicking. why don't you use the DNS of your ISP?
