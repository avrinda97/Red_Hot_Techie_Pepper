2012-02-10T05:16:00.000Z	crc32		Where is the network manager? in Ubuntu.  There is not signal ICON or anyting on my panel. I can create connections but I can't enable them from network-connections. How do I enable a network connection such as an already configured VPN connection.
2012-02-10T05:17:00.000Z	crc32		gnome withut gdm.
2012-02-10T05:18:00.000Z	zykotick9	crc32	you can try running "nm-applet" (NOTE: if you want to connect to wireless you might NEED GDM)
2012-02-10T05:30:00.000Z	zykotick9	crc32	verify that you have gnome-indicator-applet in your toolbar
2012-02-10T05:41:00.000Z	zykotick9	crc32	do you have indicator-applet in your menu?  Use "Add to Menu" to verify.
2012-02-10T05:42:00.000Z	zykotick9	crc32	add indicator-applet
2012-02-10T05:44:00.000Z	crc32	zykotick9	it looks like a speaker with a red X appeared along with an ICON of email
2012-02-10T05:44:00.000Z	zykotick9	crc32	try running nm-applet again
2012-02-10T05:46:00.000Z	crc32	zykotick9	nm-applet warns that its already running and also warns it coulden't initialize the D-Bus manager.
2012-02-10T05:46:00.000Z	zykotick9	crc32	try "killall nm-applet" then "nm-applet" from a terminal
2012-02-10T05:48:00.000Z	zykotick9	crc32	what's is the icon to the left of teh speaker?
2012-02-10T05:50:00.000Z	zykotick9	crc32	no, you "should" have another icon
2012-02-10T05:51:00.000Z	zykotick9	crc32	yup
2012-02-10T05:52:00.000Z	zykotick9	crc32	do you have network-manager-gnome installed?  verify with "apt-cache policy network-manager-gnome" in a terminal
2012-02-10T05:53:00.000Z	zykotick9	crc32	well, I'm out of ideas, good luck.
2012-02-10T05:56:00.000Z	zykotick9	crc32	nm-applet (i think we went over this?)
2012-02-10T05:57:00.000Z	crc32	zykotick9	Nothing you've gone over was ever conclusive.
2012-02-10T05:57:00.000Z	zykotick9	crc32	right well good luck.
