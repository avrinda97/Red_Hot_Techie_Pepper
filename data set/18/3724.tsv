2009-08-14T08:51:00.000Z	jedc	Fox	make sure visual affects are set to none in System->Preferences->Appearance
2009-08-14T08:52:00.000Z	Fox	jedc	visual effects are none
2009-08-14T08:52:00.000Z	jedc	Fox	like mardoct says, you can use xfce instead of gnome, it is more lightweight for older hardware
2009-08-14T08:53:00.000Z	jedc	Fox	you dont need to reinstall though if you want to , just sudo apt-get install xfce, then choose sessions->xfce before logging in, it will ask if you want to make it default, probably try it out first though
2009-08-14T08:59:00.000Z	jedc	Fox	yes, that is what you want
2009-08-14T09:04:00.000Z	jedc	Fox	at the login screen, click the options thing to the bottom left, then choose session, pick xfce
2009-08-14T09:13:00.000Z	jedc	Fox	if its in use it wont let you, also many names are registered
2009-08-14T09:13:00.000Z	jedc	Fox	type /nick FoxStang
2009-08-14T09:25:00.000Z	jedc	Fox	were you able to find the system monitor?
2009-08-14T09:31:00.000Z	jedc	Fox	yes, it will slow down a lot if you run really heavy programs like eclipse of something
2009-08-14T09:56:00.000Z	jedc	Fox	are you runnning a program that is doing a lot of work?
2009-08-14T09:57:00.000Z	Fox	jedc	irc, synaptic, firefox, and system monitor. I figured a pentium 4 1.7ghz could handle that but maybe not. What do you think?
2009-08-14T09:58:00.000Z	jedc	Fox	if synaptic is installing something then it could easily be at 100%
2009-08-14T10:16:00.000Z	jedc	Fox	that wont make it any faster
