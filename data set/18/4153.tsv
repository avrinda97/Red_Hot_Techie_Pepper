2009-06-18T01:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jerkman	have you tried renaming ~/.mozilla
2009-06-18T01:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jerkman	are you fully updated?
2009-06-18T01:47:00.000Z	jerkman	ActionParsnip	deleting my settings?
2009-06-18T01:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jerkman	no, only rename so it is backed up
2009-06-18T01:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jerkman	delete is the last step ONLY
2009-06-18T01:48:00.000Z	jerkman	ActionParsnip	right, the whole other kernel thing? ive only just installed jaunty. Intrepid worked perfectly
2009-06-18T01:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jerkman	you could also create an additional user to see if it is the users profile which is bad
2009-06-18T01:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jerkman	then why did you fix intrepid if it wasnt broken?
2009-06-18T01:48:00.000Z	jerkman	ActionParsnip	all my setting came from intrepid, so it could be that
2009-06-18T01:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jerkman	i would rename compiz and mozilla settings and rerun both to get new stock settings
2009-06-18T01:49:00.000Z	jerkman	ActionParsnip	i tried to upgrade video drivers, and i screwed the whole system
2009-06-18T01:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jerkman	they may have different layouts which may be causing issues
2009-06-18T01:49:00.000Z	jerkman	ActionParsnip	i will try now. If i log off suddenly, you know you were wrong :p
2009-09-03T20:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jerkman	hp printers have tonnes of support
2009-09-03T20:11:00.000Z	jerkman	ActionParsnip	what about over samba with the hplip driver?
2009-09-03T20:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jerkman	just in general, the hplip driver is awesome
