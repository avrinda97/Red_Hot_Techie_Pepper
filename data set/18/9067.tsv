2007-05-14T13:43:00.000Z	crssout		hi :)...... need help on an issue, I changed the host name to something else, told me that if i needed to lunch applications I would have to log back in, well I did but it gnome now fails to start, don't know how to make it work with terminal
2007-05-14T13:44:00.000Z	crssout		yeah i tried with hostname but it resets when i reboot back to the screwd up value
2007-05-14T13:46:00.000Z	crssout		am I going to have to reinstall ubuntu? I don't know why this even happened, all I did is change the hostname :(

2007-05-14T13:49:00.000Z	insmod	crssout	: graphic utils suck -- but i am an old fart 11yrs linux user lol i hate gui
2007-05-14T13:50:00.000Z	insmod	crssout	: yes u must
2007-05-14T13:51:00.000Z	insmod	crssout	: did you reboot?
2007-05-14T13:51:00.000Z	crssout	insmod	its odd that that screwd it up, yes i rebooted, tried changing the hostname back through the backup terminal, but it doesn't stick when I reboot
2007-05-14T13:52:00.000Z	crssout	insmod	I changed the host name to the exact value of my username, maybe that had something to do with it?
2007-05-14T13:54:00.000Z	insmod	crssout	: sudo  echo "name >> /etc/hostname"
2007-05-14T13:54:00.000Z	crssout	insmod	what will that do? right now im windows xp since I cant do anything
2007-05-14T13:55:00.000Z	insmod	crssout	: change the host name
2007-05-14T13:56:00.000Z	crssout	insmod	k i'll give it a shot, let me just clarify sudo echo"(new name goes here?) >> /etc/hostname:
2007-05-14T13:57:00.000Z	insmod	crssout	: yup
2007-05-14T13:57:00.000Z	crssout	insmod	k brb
2007-05-14T14:11:00.000Z	crssout	insmod	k didn't work :(, samething, when rebooted, hostname was still the latter
