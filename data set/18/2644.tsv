2010-08-31T14:37:00.000Z	Anomie2		grep 'Empty ad slot'' /var/www/ablemagazine.co.uk/wp-content/themes/mystique
2010-08-31T14:37:00.000Z	Anomie2		doesnt work either
2010-08-31T14:37:00.000Z	Anomie2		gives me the return '>' and lets me type
2010-08-31T14:39:00.000Z	Anomie2		root@CravenPublishing:~# grep 'Empty ad slot' /var/www/ablemagazine.co.uk/wp-content/themes/mystique
2010-08-31T14:39:00.000Z	Anomie2		root@CravenPublishing:~#
2010-08-31T14:41:00.000Z	Anomie2		Hmm, why isn't this working :/ Ive used this command before fine...and it's returning the result instantly no matter what directory I set it to so it isnt searching the files and finding 0 results
2010-08-31T14:43:00.000Z	Anomie2		its not that fast...I'm running through SSH and usually a grep search will take 5-10 min
2010-08-31T14:45:00.000Z	Anomie2		root@CravenPublishing:~# grep -i \'Empty ad slot\' /var/www/ablemagazine.co.uk/wp-content/themes/mystique
2010-08-31T14:45:00.000Z	Anomie2		grep: ad: No such file or directory
2010-08-31T14:45:00.000Z	Anomie2		grep: slot': No such file or directory
2010-08-31T14:47:00.000Z	mickster04	Anomie2	why dont you just run the grep from the remote oc?
2010-08-31T14:48:00.000Z	Anomie2	mickster04	It's a webserver
2010-08-31T14:49:00.000Z	mickster04	Anomie2	yeah it will have grep installed?
2010-08-31T14:49:00.000Z	mickster04	Anomie2	well run it remotely rather than locally thru ssh
2010-08-31T14:49:00.000Z	mickster04	Anomie2	grep is command line?
2010-08-31T14:50:00.000Z	mickster04	Anomie2	so are you running grep locally or on the remote compputer?
2010-08-31T14:53:00.000Z	mickster04	Anomie2	what does the remote pc not having gnome or kde have to do with anything?
2010-08-31T14:57:00.000Z	mickster04	Anomie2	but if you are running gnome you dont need a Gui
