2010-07-13T02:36:00.000Z	zerty		from windows ?
2010-07-13T02:36:00.000Z	kholzer	zerty	what are you trying to do?
2010-07-13T02:37:00.000Z	kholzer	zerty	you need to make a .deb?  your own software or what?
2010-07-13T02:38:00.000Z	kholzer	zerty	you aren't being very clear.
2010-07-13T02:38:00.000Z	kholzer	zerty	in the too hard category; why can't your server build it?
2010-07-13T02:38:00.000Z	kholzer	zerty	or can you get a binary?
2010-07-13T02:39:00.000Z	kholzer	zerty	so what, gcc will still run under custom kernels...
2010-07-13T02:40:00.000Z	kholzer	zerty	doesn't make sense why you can't just use the package manager to install it; your server is an x86 box, right?

2010-07-13T02:47:00.000Z	kholzer	zerty	just make it from scratch.  no need to make a package....
2010-07-13T02:48:00.000Z	kholzer	zerty	just compile it on the box you will run it on.
2010-07-13T02:49:00.000Z	kholzer	zerty	it won't hurt anything if you compile on that box...it shouldn' otherwise either...

2010-07-13T02:55:00.000Z	kholzer	zerty	no.
2010-07-13T02:55:00.000Z	kholzer	zerty	as in beer, the player is.
