2005-09-23T15:14:00.000Z	RMeist		q: does ubuntu's apt-get work with debian sites?
2005-09-23T15:14:00.000Z	Seveas	RMeist	yes, but you should NOT mix ubuntu and debian
2005-09-23T15:15:00.000Z	Seveas	RMeist	almost all that's in debian is in Ubuntu, what do you want to grab from debian?
2005-09-23T15:15:00.000Z	RMeist	Seveas	I'd like to apt-get eterm but its not in my downloaded package list, so nothing deb specific
2005-09-23T15:16:00.000Z	Seveas	RMeist	there's an UBuntu package for eterm
2005-09-23T15:19:00.000Z	RMeist	Seveas	my repo is set to universe, apt-get however doesn't recognize eterm
2005-09-23T15:19:00.000Z	RMeist	Seveas	sorry
2005-09-23T15:19:00.000Z	Seveas	RMeist	there is no such thing as 'set to universe'
