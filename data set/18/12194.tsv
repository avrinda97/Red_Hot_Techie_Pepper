2006-08-03T16:37:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey		(playback)
2006-08-03T16:37:00.000Z	jbaloul	BHSPitMonkey	yes
2006-08-03T16:37:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	jbaloul	are you SURE you don't have a setting wrong? (Capture volume)
2006-08-03T16:38:00.000Z	jbaloul		i tried everything
2006-08-03T16:38:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	jbaloul	bad mic perhaps?
2006-08-03T16:38:00.000Z	jbaloul		nope, tested on a different pc and was working before, plus i can here myself if i unmute the mic
2006-08-03T16:39:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey	jbaloul	if you can hear yourself, then the mic is working...
2006-08-03T16:39:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey		it's the program you're trying to record in
2006-08-03T16:39:00.000Z	jbaloul		i know, but i can't record, capture, skype, or anything
2006-08-03T16:39:00.000Z	jbaloul		arecord in console doesn't even record
2006-08-03T16:39:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey		look at the audio settings in those programs... not sure what to tell you
2006-08-03T16:39:00.000Z	BHSPitMonkey		it obviously is getting something
2006-08-03T16:40:00.000Z	jbaloul	BHSPitMonkey	i think that is a hardware thing
