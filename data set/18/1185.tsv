2011-06-21T08:44:00.000Z	Jeffsi		i downloaded it via torrent so i would assume it wowuld be fine
2011-06-21T08:45:00.000Z	wols	Jeffsi	check the md5sum still
2011-06-21T09:04:00.000Z	wols	Jeffsi	try md5sum /dev/sr0  ?
2011-06-21T09:05:00.000Z	wols	Jeffsi	ctrl+alt+f2
2011-06-21T09:06:00.000Z	wols	Jeffsi	go to "try" then and check there
2011-06-21T09:42:00.000Z	wols	Jeffsi	in BIOS, it's idle. when it boots it runs stuff, even when it's mostly I/O bound
2011-06-21T09:43:00.000Z	Jeffsi	wols	alright, what would you think it is then?
2011-06-21T09:47:00.000Z	wols	Jeffsi	it still sounds like hardware. I'd run a memtest86 and check the exhaust fan for it getting too hot. if windows is still installed, run prime95 there
2011-06-21T09:48:00.000Z	Jeffsi	wols	hmmm, it just shut off with the server disk going
2011-06-21T09:49:00.000Z	wols	Jeffsi	define "shut off"
2011-06-21T09:51:00.000Z	Jeffsi	wols	the computer turns off as if i held the power button, fans spin down, HDDs spin down, etc
2011-06-21T09:51:00.000Z	wols	Jeffsi	acpi or hardware issue (like overheating)
2011-06-21T09:52:00.000Z	wols	Jeffsi	what machine is it?
2011-06-21T09:54:00.000Z	Jeffsi	wols	i think this was made by gigabyte but it has parts frm other computers that i threw in
2011-06-21T09:55:00.000Z	Jeffsi	wols	what was that
2011-06-21T09:56:00.000Z	Jeffsi	wols	no its at diferent times and the mobo is a ga-81pe1000-g
2011-06-21T09:57:00.000Z	wols	Jeffsi	tried the alternate installer?
2011-06-21T09:58:00.000Z	Jeffsi	wols	no, i ran out of cd's and am unsure how to do usb booting
