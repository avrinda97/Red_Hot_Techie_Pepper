2009-03-19T19:33:00.000Z	different		i have windows installed on c drive and i want to install ubuntu on c drive i also want to keep windows recovery but i am worried that later on when i do the recovery my ubuntu will be lost
2009-03-19T19:34:00.000Z	danbhfive_jaunt1	different	the recovery is usually just a hidden partition.  Just make sure to leave that partition alone when partitioning
2009-03-19T19:35:00.000Z	danbhfive_jaunt1	different	how big is your harddrive?
2009-03-19T19:37:00.000Z	danbhfive_jaunt1	different	ok, listen to this, ignore everything else that you have been told
2009-03-19T19:37:00.000Z	danbhfive_jaunt1	different	just shrink your windows partition, and install ubuntu to the leftover space
2009-03-19T19:40:00.000Z	danbhfive_jaunt1	different	is your computer a laptop?
2009-03-19T19:41:00.000Z	different	danbhfive_jaunt1	yes

2009-03-19T19:42:00.000Z	different	danbhfive_jaunt1	hp pavalion
2009-03-19T19:45:00.000Z	different	danbhfive_jaunt1	i have hp pavalion laptop
2009-03-19T19:47:00.000Z	danbhfive_jaunt1	different	yeah, so if your recovery can be invoked from the bios (ie, the first screen that shows up when you boot), then your recovery is just a hidden partition.  I would suggest these steps.  Defrag your windows drive.  Boot the livecd, and shrink the windows partition.  Create a new partition (at least 20g), format as ext3 and a mount point of /      Then click continue.  You should be ok.
2009-03-19T19:48:00.000Z	different	danbhfive_jaunt1	i want to ask when i will be doing recovery will my ubuntu on c drive will be lost or not as i want to keep only recovery of windows
2009-03-19T19:50:00.000Z	danbhfive_jaunt1	different	are you saying you want to delete window completely, save the recovery option?
2009-03-19T19:50:00.000Z	different	danbhfive_jaunt1	yes
2009-03-19T19:51:00.000Z	danbhfive_jaunt1	different	I'd start with a dual boot first.   Just to be safe.
2009-03-19T19:52:00.000Z	different	danbhfive_jaunt1	i have installed ubuntu already but i want to ask when i will be doing recovery will  the windows will be installed on c drive or not
2009-03-19T19:53:00.000Z	danbhfive_jaunt1	different	no, AFAIK, it will delete ubuntu
2009-03-19T19:54:00.000Z	different	danbhfive_jaunt1	thanks
