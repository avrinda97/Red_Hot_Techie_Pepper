2005-07-30T06:24:00.000Z	Zukero		hello
2005-07-30T06:25:00.000Z	Zukero		i can't get Totem to read video files correctly, nor its thumbnailer for nautilus....
2005-07-30T06:25:00.000Z	Zukero		i followed the procedure about multimedia codecs on ubuntuguide.org
2005-07-30T06:25:00.000Z	Zukero		but still, not thumbnails, and no videos in totem
2005-07-30T06:26:00.000Z	Zukero		when I open a video with totem, I can hear the sound stream, but the video is replaced by some audio visualisation plug-in...
2005-07-30T06:27:00.000Z	djp	Zukero	sounds like you do not have the correct codec to play that file
2005-07-30T06:27:00.000Z	djp	Zukero	what is the file you are trying to play?
2005-07-30T06:27:00.000Z	Zukero	djp	: they all play nicely in MPlayer
2005-07-30T06:27:00.000Z	Zukero	djp	: lots of them
2005-07-30T06:28:00.000Z	djp	Zukero	under totem you will need to install gstreamer-ffmpeg
2005-07-30T06:28:00.000Z	Zukero	djp	: that's done
2005-07-30T06:28:00.000Z	djp	Zukero	gstreamer-plugins metapackage?
2005-07-30T06:29:00.000Z	djp	Zukero	should playback then... sorry i can't be anymore help i'm afraid. maybe someone else here knows of certain issues
2005-07-30T06:30:00.000Z	Zukero	djp	: is there any way to use MPlayer as thumbnailer ?
2005-07-30T06:31:00.000Z	djp	Zukero	you want to make MPlayer the default player?
2005-07-30T06:32:00.000Z	Zukero	djp	: default player is not that of a worry, it's more about thumbnailing in nautilus
2005-07-30T06:32:00.000Z	djp	Zukero	i'm not sure. i have always used the default players here
