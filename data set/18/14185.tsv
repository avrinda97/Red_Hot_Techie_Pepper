2005-09-07T09:09:00.000Z	DewDude		i've not heard the Xi-Fi "superrip"
2005-09-07T09:09:00.000Z	DewDude		i don't know exactly how it works..i've come to not use hardware DSP's
2005-09-07T09:09:00.000Z	DewDude		everything i do in software
2005-09-07T09:10:00.000Z	DewDude		except EQ
2005-09-07T09:10:00.000Z	DewDude		i got a nice piece of analog hardware to do my EQ for me
2005-09-07T09:11:00.000Z	DewDude		would you say "Advanced Resolution" on DVD-Audio is a marketing gimmick?
2005-09-07T09:11:00.000Z	DewDude		good god
2005-09-07T09:11:00.000Z	DewDude		you people
2005-09-07T09:11:00.000Z	DewDude		like
2005-09-07T09:11:00.000Z	DewDude		you take nyquist theory so literally
2005-09-07T09:12:00.000Z	tritium	DewDude	of course.
2005-09-07T09:13:00.000Z	tritium	DewDude	if your ears can't tell a difference, what's the point?
2005-09-07T09:13:00.000Z	tritium	DewDude	perhaps you have sensitivity above 22k.
2005-09-07T09:16:00.000Z	tritium	DewDude	Nyquist sampling theorem is well-developed, proven, and exact
2005-09-07T09:17:00.000Z	tritium	DewDude	the problem with CDs is the dynamic range.  it has nothing to do with sampling rate
2005-09-07T09:18:00.000Z	tritium	DewDude	sounds like you're sensitive to the poor dynamic range (a result of only 16-bit samples)
2005-09-07T09:19:00.000Z	DewDude	tritium	dynamic range a bit....but the first CD's were mastered on standard 44.1/16 and sounded...digital
2005-09-07T09:21:00.000Z	tritium	DewDude	it's not extra information
