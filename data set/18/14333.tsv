2005-08-25T11:27:00.000Z	reiki		there's a boatload of people in #spamassassin but you could hear a pin drop in there. :)
2005-08-25T11:28:00.000Z	reiki		I'm so close to having this working CORRECTLY. I have Spamassassin catching spam in Evolution simply by adding a filter that pipes to spamassassin. But it's ignoring whitelist_from and it's not tagging the subject line.
2005-08-25T11:30:00.000Z	reiki		anyone good with spamassassin? I'm close to having a good spam tagging tool here... just a couple minor things :)
2005-08-25T11:31:00.000Z	reiki		what's the command line entry to search for a file anywhere in my filesystem?
2005-08-25T11:31:00.000Z	Xenguy	reiki	just ask
2005-08-25T11:31:00.000Z	Xenguy	reiki	'find' or 'locate'
2005-08-25T11:32:00.000Z	Xenguy	reiki	'locate' requires you to run 'sudo updatedb' first
2005-08-25T11:34:00.000Z	Xenguy	reiki	did you install from package or source?
2005-08-25T11:34:00.000Z	reiki	Xenguy	I installed using apt-get install
2005-08-25T11:35:00.000Z	Xenguy	reiki	what kirtis said
2005-08-25T11:36:00.000Z	reiki	Xenguy	ok installed that... gonna run spamassassin through debug again and see if that fixed anything...
2005-08-25T11:40:00.000Z	reiki	Xenguy	and kirtis: ok that fixed the complaint in debug mode. Now I get absolutely no errors, and I can see it's looking in the right places for conf files, but it's still not modifying teh subject line, using whitelist_from, or even adding X-Spam headers. It's not modifying the headers at all
2005-08-25T11:42:00.000Z	Xenguy	reiki	It was too long ago for me to be of further help.  I know that using SA's bayesian filters with large portions of sample spam and ham dramatically increased the effectiveness of SA for me tho
2005-08-25T11:42:00.000Z	Xenguy	reiki	i.e. 'sa-learn'
2005-08-25T11:43:00.000Z	reiki	Xenguy	oh it's WORKING as far as catching spam. It's even sorting it into a Spam folder I created. It's just ignoring the local.cf and user_prefs files as far as whitelisting and changing the header
2005-08-25T11:43:00.000Z	Xenguy	reiki	you'll get there - good luck :-)
2005-08-25T11:43:00.000Z	reiki	Xenguy	thanks :)  at least teh DNS thing is fixed... now to get it tagging.....
2006-10-28T13:34:00.000Z	Xenguy	reiki	or ./foo.sh
