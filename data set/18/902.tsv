2011-08-20T11:29:00.000Z	MrSalt	newbie_	You're not doing anything wierd with the partitioning, are you?
2011-08-20T11:30:00.000Z	MrSalt	newbie_	Do you have a raid setup?
2011-08-20T11:31:00.000Z	MrSalt	newbie_	Nevermind, that's good.  If you're formatting the whole disk, then it should at least come up without crashing.  :(
2011-08-20T11:31:00.000Z	MrSalt	newbie_	Maybe try the advanced partitioning, and manually delete the old XP parition and create a new one so you know the old stuff is good and dead.
2011-08-20T11:32:00.000Z	MrSalt	newbie_	I'm just making this up. It might not help, but I'm grasping around.
2011-08-20T11:33:00.000Z	MrSalt	newbie_	Oh, sorry, missed that part of the conversation.
2011-08-20T11:34:00.000Z	MrSalt	newbie_	Same here.  Good luck.
2011-08-20T11:35:00.000Z	MrSalt	newbie_	Noted.  :)
