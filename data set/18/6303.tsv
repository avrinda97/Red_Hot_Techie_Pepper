2009-06-27T04:48:00.000Z	raylu	volve	yes
2009-06-27T04:49:00.000Z	volve	raylu	interesting! Any pointers whilst I google? :)
2009-06-27T04:50:00.000Z	raylu	volve	also, it soulds like your problems could be solved by running an rsyncd instead of tunneling through ssh
2009-06-27T04:50:00.000Z	volve	raylu	well yes, except there's a firewall in the way...
2009-06-27T04:50:00.000Z	raylu	volve	by the way, why do you need to preserve ownership anyway?
2009-06-27T04:50:00.000Z	raylu	volve	there's a firewall in the way preventing you from running an rsyncd but sshd works?
2009-06-27T04:51:00.000Z	volve	raylu	because I'm trying to mirror a hot backup for many users photos :/
2009-06-27T04:51:00.000Z	raylu	volve	and the users all have their own directories, right?
2009-06-27T04:51:00.000Z	volve	raylu	doesn't rsyncd need a dedicated port? the only ports I have available at 80 & 22
2009-06-27T04:52:00.000Z	raylu	volve	oh. that sucks.
2009-06-27T04:52:00.000Z	volve	raylu	yeah I was thinking the same thing :\
2009-06-27T04:52:00.000Z	raylu	volve	as long as each user has his/her own directory, you shouldn't worry about preserving ownership
2009-06-27T04:52:00.000Z	raylu	volve	if your drive ever goes down, you can just restore each users' files to their directories
2009-06-27T04:52:00.000Z	volve	raylu	oh, well, there are some inter-mingled files too, that's the trouble
2009-06-27T04:53:00.000Z	raylu	volve	generally, that's a bad idea...
2009-06-27T04:53:00.000Z	volve	raylu	yeah... but I appreciate your help! :)
2009-06-27T06:32:00.000Z	raylu	volve	replace ' with "
2009-06-27T06:32:00.000Z	volve	raylu	hmm
