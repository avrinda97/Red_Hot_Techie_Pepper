2008-03-14T20:00:00.000Z	v3ctor	Chew1	did you try renaming your ~/.mozilla directory and try starting it?
2008-03-14T20:00:00.000Z	v3ctor	Chew1	your home directory
2008-03-14T20:01:00.000Z	v3ctor	Chew1	you can call it whatever you want, like .mozilla-test
2008-03-14T20:01:00.000Z	v3ctor	Chew1	it is a hidden file
2008-03-14T20:03:00.000Z	Chew1	v3ctor	:D it fixed it thanks, but now how would i go about getting flash installed?
2008-03-14T20:04:00.000Z	v3ctor	Chew1	if you don't mind the manual process, you could get the linux version from adaobe and use their install instructions
2008-03-14T20:06:00.000Z	Chew1	v3ctor	whats another source o get flash?
2008-03-14T20:07:00.000Z	v3ctor	Chew1	check the ubuntu forums, i use the adobe method
