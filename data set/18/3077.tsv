2009-12-19T23:33:00.000Z	ipnk		how to tell aptget to redownload the packages, so that aptoncd shows all the applicantions. presently it lists only the recently installed ones
2009-12-19T23:34:00.000Z	mac9416	ipnk	you must install the packages with Synaptic before APTOnCD can see them.
2009-12-19T23:35:00.000Z	mac9416		Ipeer, oh, you want to re-install them. Hmmm...
2009-12-19T23:36:00.000Z	ipnk	mac9416	yes i did all of them through synaptic or using apt-get install, but it shows only the recently installed only and not all of them previously installed
2009-12-19T23:36:00.000Z	mac9416	ipnk	right, it deletes them after one month. Use 'aptitude download <package>' to get them regardless of whether they are installed.
2009-12-19T23:37:00.000Z	ipnk	mac9416	ok i will give it a try
2009-12-19T23:40:00.000Z	ipnk		<mac9416> but it starts downloading, that means to let it go to a place from aptoncd look into, i will have to download all the packages again, this isn't possible for me, is there any other way.
2009-12-19T23:41:00.000Z	mac9416	ipnk	I'm afraid not really. APT deletes downloaded package files after a month.
2009-12-19T23:42:00.000Z	mac9416	ipnk	if you want a simpler interface, you should look at Keryx. It's purpose is to download packages and dependencies for installation offline. I assume that's what you're shooting for.
2009-12-19T23:42:00.000Z	ipnk		<mac9416>but thanks anyway, i came to know as to why the initial packages were not listed there
2009-12-19T23:42:00.000Z	mac9416	ipnk	cool, why were they missing?
2009-12-19T23:43:00.000Z	ipnk		<mac9416>i meant you just told me that apt deletes them after a month, (if i got right what you said)!
2009-12-19T23:44:00.000Z	mac9416	ipnk	ah, OK. Yes, that's what I meant.
2009-12-19T23:44:00.000Z	ipnk		<mac9416>ok, then.
2009-12-19T23:44:00.000Z	mac9416	ipnk	sorry the news is no better than that.
2009-12-19T23:44:00.000Z	ipnk		<mac9416>ok.
2009-12-19T23:45:00.000Z	ipnk		<mac9416>i'll try to find some alternative
2009-12-19T23:46:00.000Z	mac9416	ipnk	roger. Look into Keryx if you can't find anything better.
