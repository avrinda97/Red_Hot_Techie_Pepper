2012-05-17T12:30:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	ryannathans	please see my last to comments (sent to dr_Willis by accident)
2012-05-17T12:31:00.000Z	ryannathans	DarwinSurvivor	does it make it more interesting if I say the client is windows?
2012-05-17T12:31:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	ryannathans	yes, that rules out NFS and SSHFS and leaves you with dlna (mediatomb/ushare) or samba
2012-05-17T12:33:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	ryannathans	OH, *that* kind of audio streaming!
2012-05-17T12:34:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	ryannathans	*IF* you get it to work, I'm 99% sure you will never get tracking correctly. streaming audio in real time between ANY computers and getting it to track to a separate video feed is nearly impossible
2012-05-17T12:34:00.000Z	ryannathans	DarwinSurvivor	I got my mouse and keyboard working on two computers at once ;)
2012-05-17T12:35:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	ryannathans	using synergy?
2012-05-17T12:35:00.000Z	ryannathans	DarwinSurvivor	yeah
2012-05-17T12:39:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	ryannathans	do you want ALL audio to be streamed, or just some applications?
2012-05-17T12:41:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	ryannathans	what is the physical distance between them?
2012-05-17T12:41:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	ryannathans	I think the easiest method would be to go to the dollar store and by a $8 male-male audio cable and hook the linux machine's line out to the windows machine's line-in :D
2012-05-17T12:42:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	ryannathans	that will also eliminate lagg due to buffering!
2012-05-17T12:42:00.000Z	ryannathans	DarwinSurvivor	you can do that?
2012-05-17T12:42:00.000Z	ryannathans	DarwinSurvivor	hmm, do like.
2012-05-17T12:42:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	ryannathans	yes. alteratively, you could buy a mixer, but that will probably cost more
2012-05-17T12:42:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	ryannathans	make sure you use the line-in and not the microphone port!
2012-05-17T12:45:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	ryannathans	ok
2012-05-17T12:53:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	ryannathans	nothing like solving a software problem with hardware :D
