2008-02-17T21:51:00.000Z	jrib	prodigel	sorry
2008-04-27T23:49:00.000Z	jrib	prodigel	from what I have seen, your ISP just compresses images, that's not something done on your computer, it's done before the data reaches you
2008-04-27T23:53:00.000Z	prodigel	jrib	Ok. But is there something similar for whole network traffic? like tcp/udp packages being compressed or something?
2008-04-27T23:53:00.000Z	jrib	prodigel	no idea
2008-09-05T16:45:00.000Z	jrib	prodigel	you can't yet
