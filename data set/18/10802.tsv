2008-04-29T19:45:00.000Z	bododo		I just finsihed (it took me years) downloading the hardy install cd, but it seems that i can't upgrade my system with it. Is there any hack i can make to upgrade with the standard install cd?
2008-04-29T19:46:00.000Z	bododo		my Internet connexion is so slow :(
2008-04-29T19:46:00.000Z	bododo		I can't redownload the alternativd cd$
2008-04-29T19:46:00.000Z	bododo		is there a way to upgrade using a standard one?
2008-04-29T19:47:00.000Z	bododo		anyone? :(
2008-04-29T19:47:00.000Z	erUSUL	bododo	no; no way
2008-04-29T19:47:00.000Z	bododo	erUSUL	not a single hack?
2008-04-29T19:48:00.000Z	erUSUL	bododo	no; no deb files on the live system
2008-04-29T19:48:00.000Z	bododo	erUSUL	it seems that the cd i downloaded has an error in one file, can I bypass this?
2008-04-29T19:49:00.000Z	bododo	erUSUL	any way to copy to the hard disk and then install from there?
2009-04-27T03:39:00.000Z	erUSUL	bododo	mount the iso on loopback and use it
2009-04-27T03:39:00.000Z	bododo	erUSUL	but then cdromupgrade won't work
2009-04-27T03:40:00.000Z	erUSUL	bododo	it have worked for mi in the past... maybe ppc has some issues with it ?
2009-04-27T03:40:00.000Z	bododo	erUSUL	so I just mount it and then run the script?
2009-04-27T03:41:00.000Z	bododo	erUSUL	better to mount it in my home?
2009-04-27T03:41:00.000Z	erUSUL	bododo	yep. as i said « Works For Me (tm) »
2009-04-27T03:41:00.000Z	erUSUL	bododo	does not matter
