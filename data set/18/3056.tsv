2010-03-23T06:28:00.000Z	bobstro	Maletor	 you can compile from source on ubuntu if you want. nothing wrong with gentoo if you want that approach.
2010-09-19T22:46:00.000Z	bobstro	Maletor	 at 1st glance, that looks like policy-based routing
2010-09-19T22:46:00.000Z	bobstro	Maletor	 but 192.168.0.0/16 addresses don't look right for external.
2010-09-19T22:49:00.000Z	bobstro	Maletor	 i don't *think* dd-wrt will do that level of routing.
2010-09-19T22:49:00.000Z	bobstro	Maletor	 the question isn't very clear as posted.
2010-09-19T22:49:00.000Z	Maletor	bobstro	but you know what i'm trying to do right
2010-09-19T22:50:00.000Z	Maletor	bobstro	can you help me understand my problem better
2010-09-19T22:50:00.000Z	bobstro	Maletor	 sort of, but the page is not very clear. it sounds like you want to route different traffic over different links based on protocol.
2010-09-19T22:50:00.000Z	bobstro	Maletor	 a lot of people try to do that with 2 ISPs
2010-09-19T22:50:00.000Z	Maletor	bobstro	ya that's kind of what i'm trying to do
2010-09-19T22:51:00.000Z	Maletor	bobstro	dual wan is another option but that is a bad option as round robin load balancing doesn't work for me
2010-09-19T22:51:00.000Z	bobstro	Maletor	 it's not trivial because of how routing works. it can be done, but i'm not sure with dd-wrt.
2010-09-19T22:52:00.000Z	Maletor	bobstro	i just want two gateways and two external ips which are on the same network
2010-09-19T22:52:00.000Z	bobstro	Maletor	 for redundancy or performance?
2010-09-19T22:52:00.000Z	Maletor	bobstro	performance
2010-09-19T22:52:00.000Z	bobstro	Maletor	 so external is ONE network?
2010-09-19T22:53:00.000Z	bobstro	Maletor	 for redundancy, you could use vrrp. a faster interface to that ONE network would be easier.
2010-09-19T22:53:00.000Z	bobstro	Maletor	 you want to aggregate two routers to an outside network for faster performance? yes, without spending more money, i think so.
