2009-05-28T04:06:00.000Z	VCoolio	Welshy-Rob	sudo shutdown hh:mm  (24 hour format, see 'shutdown --help'
2009-05-28T04:19:00.000Z	Welshy-Rob		anyone??
2009-05-28T04:20:00.000Z	VCoolio	Welshy-Rob	sudo shutdown hh:mm  <-- not satisfying?
2009-05-28T04:27:00.000Z	Welshy-Rob	VCoolio	what is that a program??
2009-05-28T04:28:00.000Z	VCoolio	Welshy-Rob	it's a command; normally you use shutdown now to, well, shutdown, but you can use a time as well
2009-05-28T04:28:00.000Z	VCoolio	Welshy-Rob	if you need it many times and same time always to shutdown make a little script and add that to startup applications
2009-05-28T04:34:00.000Z	Welshy-Rob	VCoolio	ok im new so i dont know about that script but when i used "sudo shutdown hh:mm" my pc told me (/dev/pts/0) at 0:29 ...The system is going down for maintenance in 271 minutes! what is "maintenance"??and how do i stop it going into maintenance??
2009-05-28T04:36:00.000Z	VCoolio	Welshy-Rob	that's probably the default message; it will shut down at that time, meaning in 271 minutes from now. Script not necessary, just add new item in startup applications and use your command
2009-05-28T04:37:00.000Z	VCoolio		sudo shutdown -c      <-- run that to abort
2009-05-28T04:37:00.000Z	VCoolio		shutdown --help   <--- run that to see the options
2009-05-28T04:38:00.000Z	Welshy-Rob	VCoolio	Thanks = ] its good that because im downloading movies n stuff at night and i dont want to leave my pc on all night so its really usefull and again thanks
2009-05-28T04:38:00.000Z	VCoolio	Welshy-Rob	forgot to mention your name; see my above lines
2009-05-28T04:38:00.000Z	VCoolio	Welshy-Rob	you're welcome
2009-05-28T04:47:00.000Z	VCoolio	Welshy-Rob	just thought, you may need "shutdown -hP" to not only shut down but also power off your pc. Again: use --help to see the options.
2009-05-28T04:50:00.000Z	Welshy-Rob	VCoolio	what so its sudo shutdown -hp HH:MM ??
2009-05-28T04:51:00.000Z	VCoolio	Welshy-Rob	-hP means poweroff pc; only shutdown can shutdown system but not really poweroff pc
2009-05-28T04:52:00.000Z	VCoolio	Welshy-Rob	so yes, first arguments, then time; but use capital P ; "sudo shutdown -hP hh:mm"
2009-05-28T04:53:00.000Z	Welshy-Rob	VCoolio	 ok
