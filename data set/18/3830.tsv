2009-07-28T20:47:00.000Z	JenniferB		iam running ubuntu throuhg putty and my friend started an application and somehow switched to continue using the consoel.. how can I switch back to the running application console? (he has left the building)
2009-07-28T20:48:00.000Z	jackd	JenniferB	Maybe CTRL+A and then press D
2009-07-28T20:48:00.000Z	jackd	JenniferB	if he is using screen :)
2009-07-28T20:50:00.000Z	JenniferB	jackd	I think so.. yes.. screen
2009-07-28T20:50:00.000Z	jackd	JenniferB	yeah. so you can leave the screen (but let it running in background) with ctrl+a then d
2009-07-28T20:52:00.000Z	JenniferB	jackd	i accidantly closed the putty session, and restarted it.. the application is still running in the background.. and the ctrl + a  then  d doesn't seem to be working
2009-07-28T20:53:00.000Z	jackd	JenniferB	what do you exactly want to do? i dont get it 100% :)
2009-07-28T20:53:00.000Z	JenniferB		I am not sure.. I am trying to learn :) .. i think i want to kill the application but first I would like to see that "console" that started it
2009-07-28T20:54:00.000Z	jackd	JenniferB	so type "screen -ls" to see all active screen sessions. then you can "join" or "attach" to one of them with "screen -r PID_GOES_HERE"
2009-07-28T20:55:00.000Z	jackd	JenniferB	if you want to kill one of those sessions simply attach to them -> then kill them with ctrl+c -> then exit the screen with "exit"
2009-07-28T20:55:00.000Z	JenniferB		thanks :9
2009-07-28T20:55:00.000Z	JenniferB		:)
2009-07-28T20:55:00.000Z	jackd	JenniferB	welcome
2009-07-28T20:56:00.000Z	JenniferB		btw, how do I start my own screen ? :)
2009-07-28T20:56:00.000Z	jackd	JenniferB	Dulak said it :)
2009-07-28T21:00:00.000Z	JenniferB	jackd	when I type screen -ls , the message says : there is a screen on : ... but I can't really get what the PID is
2009-07-28T21:01:00.000Z	JenniferB		and I believe there is more screeens running ( i have like typed screen hundred times now )
2009-07-28T21:01:00.000Z	jackd	JenniferB	Look here: 5797.pts-1.Develb0x  5797 is the PID :)
