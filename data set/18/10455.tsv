2007-08-21T08:21:00.000Z	aoirthoir	doug__	yes.
2007-08-21T08:22:00.000Z	doug__	aoirthoir	how good is one with a laptop?
2007-08-21T08:22:00.000Z	aoirthoir	doug__	do you have an external now or you are looking to buy one?
2007-08-21T08:23:00.000Z	aoirthoir	doug__	then it really is just a matter of making sure you get one that is compatible (has drivers) on GNU/Linux
2007-08-21T08:26:00.000Z	aoirthoir	doug__	that would depend on the model.
2007-08-21T08:27:00.000Z	doug__	aoirthoir	here is the one i am looking at u think it will work with linux?   http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?skuId=7962038&st=external+cd+burner&lp=4&type=product&cp=1&id=1153336527713
2007-08-21T08:33:00.000Z	aoirthoir	doug__	i think it is cheap enough that if it doesnt work you can return it.
2007-08-21T08:34:00.000Z	doug__	aoirthoir	would it say if its compatable with linux?
