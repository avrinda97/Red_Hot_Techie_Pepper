2007-12-15T09:45:00.000Z	wy		I'm confused by the dependencies between the packages
2007-12-15T09:45:00.000Z	jrib	wy	what packages
2007-12-15T09:45:00.000Z	jrib	wy	and what is confusing?
2007-12-15T09:47:00.000Z	jrib	wy	are you installing ati's driver from a package?
2007-12-15T09:47:00.000Z	wy	jrib	Right. I built the package from ATI's driver package
2007-12-15T09:48:00.000Z	jrib	wy	yes, that is why.  You are supposed to stick to packages from the ubuntu repositories.  Otherwise of course you can build a broken package
2007-12-15T09:49:00.000Z	wy	jrib	How is the dependencies defined? Are they specified with package names or individual file names they depend one?
2007-12-15T09:49:00.000Z	jrib	wy	packages
2007-12-15T09:50:00.000Z	jrib	wy	did you actually build a .deb?
2007-12-15T09:50:00.000Z	wy	jrib	Yes. ATI's installer can build the package
2007-12-15T09:50:00.000Z	jrib	wy	probably just makes a dumb package then
2007-12-15T09:51:00.000Z	wy	jrib	Is it possible for a package to overwrite files from another?
2007-12-15T09:51:00.000Z	jrib	wy	yes, if it is a dumb package
2007-12-15T09:51:00.000Z	jrib	wy	I'm guessing dpkg will complain though
2007-12-15T09:56:00.000Z	wy	jrib	Maybe I should have sticked to the one provided by Gusty
2007-12-15T09:56:00.000Z	jrib	wy	that's usually easiest
2007-12-15T09:57:00.000Z	wy	jrib	But that one didn't support composite
2007-12-15T09:57:00.000Z	wy	jrib	so compiz didn't work.
