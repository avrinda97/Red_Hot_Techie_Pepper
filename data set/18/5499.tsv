2008-10-13T03:54:00.000Z	soundray	DocUSN-USMC	look at how many users this channel has, and imagine that everyone with a problem would paste a few lines of error messages
2008-10-15T05:42:00.000Z	soundray	DocUSN-USMC	if it's shared, you set this in the BIOS setup
2008-10-15T05:43:00.000Z	DocUSN-USMC	soundray	nope. i tried that. thiers no option lol
2008-10-15T05:43:00.000Z	soundray	DocUSN-USMC	then you can't change it. Are you sure it's shared?
2008-10-22T05:39:00.000Z	soundray	DocUSN-USMC	no, that only updates the package lists for your installed release.
2008-10-22T05:39:00.000Z	soundray	DocUSN-USMC	'sudo apt-get update ; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade'
2008-10-22T05:42:00.000Z	soundray	DocUSN-USMC	HP are making an effort with free software. Brother are ignorant.
2008-10-22T05:42:00.000Z	soundray	DocUSN-USMC	all I can tell is that they are ignorant. I haven't noticed any active dislike, but no effort whatsoever.
2008-10-22T05:46:00.000Z	soundray	DocUSN-USMC	you can attach it to a cheap wireless bridge
