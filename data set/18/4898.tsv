2009-01-18T15:25:00.000Z	baz	KingWilliam	no that would be a good test it seems....
2009-01-18T15:26:00.000Z	KingWilliam	baz	this is the command, "mysql -u root -p"
2009-01-18T15:27:00.000Z	baz	KingWilliam	i think it worked... i got "Welcome to the MySQL monitor........"
2009-01-18T15:27:00.000Z	baz	KingWilliam	so now i have to debug why phpmyadmin does not see it?
