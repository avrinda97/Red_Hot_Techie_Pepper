2012-10-27T08:31:00.000Z	dbv		Where should I ask a question on iptables. I got something that worked on Lucid but doesn't on Precise
2012-10-27T08:32:00.000Z	kunji	dbv	hmm, sounds like this is the place to ask then, though I haven't got an answer for that :P
2012-10-27T09:03:00.000Z	kunji	dbv	that shouldn't be necessary, a clean install of grub2 though is probably easier than fixing one that's not working
2012-10-27T09:03:00.000Z	dbv	kunji	that's what we're talking about, clean install
2012-10-27T09:04:00.000Z	kunji	dbv	I meant just a clean install of Grub2, not the entire OS
2012-10-27T09:04:00.000Z	dbv	kunji	i don't know how much the machine is messed up, i wouldn't take chances, that's all
2012-10-27T09:16:00.000Z	kunji	dbv	apparently not, sorry, I could use one myself.  My iptables configs have a tendency to revert on their own...
2012-10-27T09:25:00.000Z	dbv	kunji	what's reverting?
2012-10-27T09:26:00.000Z	kunji	dbv	the entire configuration seems to change back to some default one.
2012-10-27T09:27:00.000Z	dbv	kunji	are you using a particular firewall? did you check the logs?
2012-10-27T09:27:00.000Z	dbv	kunji	if something is messing with iptables, there's bound to be something in the logs
2012-10-27T09:29:00.000Z	kunji	dbv	I checked the logs, they don't show anything about it, and I'm not running any of the firewall programs (i.e. ufw).  I've been through those possibilities -_-, so I've pretty much just given up on it, barring some special revelation that people maybe wanted me to figure out from the man pages...
2012-10-27T09:30:00.000Z	dbv	kunji	so you got your own iptables rules, right?
2012-10-27T09:31:00.000Z	dbv	kunji	and when you do sudo iptables -L, they're gone after a while?
2012-10-27T09:31:00.000Z	kunji	dbv	yeah, I've saved them, so I just need to run the restore when they rever, so it's just obnoxious, but not debilitating for me
2012-10-27T09:32:00.000Z	kunji	dbv	yeah, they disappear after a while, it's hard to debug though, because that while varies from a few minutes to a few weeks.
2012-10-27T09:32:00.000Z	dbv	kunji	well, something is reverting them
2012-10-27T09:34:00.000Z	kunji	dbv	hmm, I might try ex0a's suggestion for you :P  I just haven't been able to detect anything changing it, so I was thinking it was something changing it internal to iptables.
