2012-09-17T23:31:00.000Z	chemist^		any music making app? (not recording)
2012-09-17T23:31:00.000Z	gordonjcp	chemist^	not really
2012-09-17T23:32:00.000Z	gordonjcp	chemist^	maybe something like lmms?
2012-09-17T23:32:00.000Z	gordonjcp	chemist^	there is a lot of Linux audio software but most of it is geared up to recording and synthesis
2012-09-17T23:33:00.000Z	chemist^	gordonjcp	yeah i've been doing that... now i want to have smth like lmms yes (looking at it right now on the web)
2012-09-17T23:35:00.000Z	gordonjcp	chemist^	no, I don't use computers for music any more
2012-09-17T23:35:00.000Z	gordonjcp	chemist^	I only use hardware synths and analogue tape
2012-09-17T23:36:00.000Z	gordonjcp	chemist^	I *should* give lmms a go though
2012-09-17T23:37:00.000Z	chemist^	gordonjcp	hehe :) i record samples with my el. guitar and synth too...but i don't have any drum machine :) so i need somekind of virtual drum machine to make
2012-09-17T23:37:00.000Z	gordonjcp	chemist^	I use computers for editing and generally mucking about with samples, though
2012-09-17T23:37:00.000Z	gordonjcp	chemist^	try hydrogen
2012-09-17T23:37:00.000Z	gordonjcp	chemist^	it is *just* a drum machine, with various sample sets
2012-09-17T23:37:00.000Z	gordonjcp	chemist^	no clever stuff, just a plain old-fashioned drum machine
2012-09-17T23:38:00.000Z	chemist^	gordonjcp	now that think of it i think i have it installed already :D
2012-09-17T23:40:00.000Z	chemist^	gordonjcp	hahaha...it's cool...that's what i've been looking for..thanks alot :) bye
2012-09-17T23:41:00.000Z	chemist^	gordonjcp	one more question... if u know... can you export loops you make in hydrogen?
