2009-05-19T17:01:00.000Z	GnomeLead		 regarding packages.ubuntu.com - ubuntu-restricted-extras .deb is only 3kb ( instead of 55Mb as it should be ) - why it is so ?
2009-05-19T17:02:00.000Z	Slart	GnomeLead	it's probably a meta-package
2009-05-19T17:03:00.000Z	Slart	GnomeLead	ie it depends on some other packages.. so instead of installing them all you just install one and it pulls the other ones in
2009-05-19T17:03:00.000Z	GnomeLead	Slart	I'm looking for an offline installation package - can I get it from there or it just gives you a link to all packages ?
2009-05-19T17:04:00.000Z	Slart	GnomeLead	it depends on 10 or so packages.. you want the names?
2009-05-19T17:05:00.000Z	GnomeLead	Slart	I see the names - what I wanted to know, is there a way to download it as a package ( with all these 10 apps inside ) ?
2009-05-19T17:05:00.000Z	Slart	GnomeLead	I don't think so.. afaik you have to get the packages, one by one
2009-05-19T17:05:00.000Z	Slart	GnomeLead	you can of course create a download script from synaptic
2009-05-19T17:06:00.000Z	Slart	GnomeLead	that way you don't have to do all the work by hand
2009-05-19T17:07:00.000Z	GnomeLead	Slart	thanks for the info ( it'll definitel save my time ), but - as I said, I will no internet con for a while and I want to collect some packages so I could install them without being connected to the net .. possible or crazy ?
2009-05-19T17:08:00.000Z	Slart	GnomeLead	why not see if you can create a package cache.. there are some packages that do that.. then it will automatically save any package you request in a local cache.. it's very useful if you're going to install 50 ubuntu computers.. you don't have to download each package 50 times
2009-05-19T17:09:00.000Z	Slart	GnomeLead	also, aptoncd might be useful
2009-05-19T17:09:00.000Z	GnomeLead	Slart	ok, thanks - will install Ubuntu right away and try it ( currently on XP ). Appreciate your help :)
2009-05-19T17:12:00.000Z	GnomeLead	Slart	oh, but how to install packages from CD instead of trying to fetch the list from the internet ? I assume I'll need to remove http sources and add CD as repository ?
2009-05-19T17:13:00.000Z	Slart	GnomeLead	if you insert the cd in a computer running ubuntu it will pop up a nice dialog asking you if you want to use the cd as a source for packages
2009-05-19T17:13:00.000Z	Slart	GnomeLead	the same happens if you insert a live cd in a running system
2009-05-19T17:14:00.000Z	GnomeLead	Slart	Excellent ! Again, thanks for your help - I'm leaving this channel for a few hours to install my Ubuntu :)
2009-05-19T17:14:00.000Z	Slart	GnomeLead	good luck
