2008-02-11T02:17:00.000Z	spaleyAE		wtf?
2008-02-11T02:19:00.000Z	spaleyAE		I did just add 'spaley' to sudoers
2008-02-11T02:19:00.000Z	spaleyAE		so maybe that'll fix me up
2008-02-11T02:20:00.000Z	spaleyAE		but I'm wondering now if anything else is 'broken'
2008-02-11T02:21:00.000Z	spaleyAE		ok, I'm going to reinstall... annoying but not the end of the world... thanks for the help everyone
2008-02-11T02:21:00.000Z	danand_	spaleyAE	- luck
2008-02-11T02:08:00.000Z	spaleyAE	danand_	ah, ok
2008-02-11T02:13:00.000Z	danand_	spaleyAE	- agree with Starnestommy
2008-02-11T02:14:00.000Z	danand_	spaleyAE	- no - just sudo adduser spaley admin
2008-02-11T02:14:00.000Z	spaleyAE	danand_	I can't use sudo
2008-02-11T02:14:00.000Z	spaleyAE	danand_	that's exactly the problem I'm having
2008-02-11T02:15:00.000Z	danand_	spaleyAE	- oh crap - of course :)
2008-02-11T02:19:00.000Z	danand_	spaleyAE	- does cat /etc/group | grep admin show anything?
2008-02-11T02:19:00.000Z	spaleyAE	danand_	it shows lpadmin:x:117:spaley
2008-02-11T02:20:00.000Z	danand_	spaleyAE	- lpadmin is line printer admin - it appears you don't have an admin group :O
2008-02-11T02:20:00.000Z	spaleyAE	danand_	agreed, but shouldn't that have happened during install?
2008-02-11T02:20:00.000Z	danand_	spaleyAE	- no, definately not
2008-02-11T02:21:00.000Z	danand_	spaleyAE	- agree with reinstall
