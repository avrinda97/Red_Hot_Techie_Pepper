2005-10-08T13:10:00.000Z	cosimo321		I realize Breezy is just a preview right now but they need to have serious hardware support right out of the box
2005-10-08T13:10:00.000Z	cosimo321		If not it will go by the way of BeOs
2005-10-08T13:11:00.000Z	cosimo321		I still use Be and like it,
2005-10-08T13:12:00.000Z	cosimo321		I also like this Breezy but I see little difference between the two except for GUI
2005-10-08T13:12:00.000Z	cosimo321		I am going to update be back later
2005-10-08T10:01:00.000Z	cosimo321		Helo all. Are ther any defrag utilities for breezy or linux that will work on breezy?
2005-10-08T10:02:00.000Z	cosimo321		The only os I know of that didn't fragment was BeOs
2005-10-08T10:02:00.000Z	cosimo321		like what
2005-10-08T10:02:00.000Z	cosimo321		Be Os fragmented so little that it was barely visible
2005-10-08T10:03:00.000Z	cosimo321		I sy\till use BeOs
2005-10-08T10:03:00.000Z	p0windah	cosimo321	you an old beos user ?
2005-10-08T10:06:00.000Z	p0windah	cosimo321	I wish I could afford to upgrade
2005-10-08T10:08:00.000Z	p0windah	cosimo321	silliness aside, it depends on the apps you need to use to be productive
2005-10-08T10:09:00.000Z	p0windah	cosimo321	my wife is a linguist and she will only use linux
2005-10-08T10:13:00.000Z	p0windah	cosimo321	cool, you made your point
2005-10-08T10:13:00.000Z	p0windah	cosimo321	so did you have a problem with ubuntu someone could help you with ?
2005-10-08T10:13:00.000Z	p0windah	cosimo321	first thing, have you done a search on the ubuntuforums and google ?
