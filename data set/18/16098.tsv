2004-11-16T12:39:00.000Z	Striss		i think i'll be going back to OS X soon, i can't deal very well without Photoshop and just having flash working in a web browser
2004-11-16T12:39:00.000Z	Striss		can't get java to work either
2004-11-16T12:39:00.000Z	Striss		my computer is not very functional with linux on it
2004-11-16T12:40:00.000Z	Striss		wine won't run on ppc
2004-11-16T12:41:00.000Z	Striss		i can't even run quake3 on ppc linux, i was dissapointed at that too
2004-11-16T12:41:00.000Z	Striss		i think i'll be switching back very soon
2004-11-16T12:41:00.000Z	Striss		its pretty sad that i can't even look at a flash based website
2004-11-16T12:41:00.000Z	Striss		there's no flash support for ppc linux at all
2004-11-16T12:42:00.000Z	Striss		as far as i can tell, java won't work in firefox on ppc linux either
2004-11-16T12:42:00.000Z	Striss		but i'm stuck for now because i don't have my os x cd's with me

2004-11-16T12:47:00.000Z	jcole	Striss	if you have a fast enough ppc, you can emulate an x86 with bochs
2004-11-16T12:49:00.000Z	jcole	Striss	you're asking too much then ;)
2004-11-16T12:53:00.000Z	jcole	Striss	i play quake2 all the time on linux... have mod packs even... are you talking about ppc?

2004-11-16T12:58:00.000Z	jcole	Striss	what does "lspci | grep VGA" say?
