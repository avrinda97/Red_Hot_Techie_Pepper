2008-01-01T21:15:00.000Z	Parsec300		Try 'sudo fdisk /dev/sda'
2008-01-01T21:16:00.000Z	Parsec300		If that doesn't do anything then 'sudo fdisk /dev/hda'
2008-01-01T21:16:00.000Z	Parsec300		Sudo gives you the possibility to execute a command with root-user rights.
2008-01-01T21:17:00.000Z	Parsec300		As long as you don't write anything through fdisk it's ok. And it seems astro76 knows more about it than i do.
2008-01-01T21:17:00.000Z	Parsec300		I'm a Mac user.
2008-01-01T21:18:00.000Z	Parsec300		But I also have Ubuntu on my MacBook Pro.
2008-01-01T21:19:00.000Z	Parsec300		I just can't get the 64-bit working right on it.
2008-01-01T21:19:00.000Z	Parsec300		No networking and no advanced graphics

2008-01-01T21:21:00.000Z	Parsec300	WorkingOnWise	MacBookPro 17" (dunno what card) and nVidia 8600GT i believe
2008-01-01T21:26:00.000Z	WorkingOnWise	Parsec300	try this for your video, http://www.yaroman.com/2007/08/14/howto-install-nvidia-8600gt/. gotta know what chip is used for the network to be help there.
2008-01-01T21:28:00.000Z	WorkingOnWise	Parsec300	type lspci in a terminal to find the netword card info we need.
2008-01-01T21:30:00.000Z	Parsec300	WorkingOnWise	I can't do that lspci. I'm on OSX right now
2008-01-01T21:30:00.000Z	WorkingOnWise	Parsec300	can u boot the live cd?
2008-01-01T21:33:00.000Z	WorkingOnWise	Parsec300	in my experience, 64 bit lags behind 32 just due to the sheer demand of 32 compared to 64. However, unless u are donig serious audio/video work , I didnt see a significand differance, except I have less headaches in 32 bit.
2008-01-01T21:48:00.000Z	WorkingOnWise	Parsec300	fritz forgive the late-comer question. fritz, are u replacing the xxx with the correct info, or are u using xxx in your command?
