2008-06-12T00:48:00.000Z	dacubuntu		hi guys... i need some help shrinking my ntfs partition
2008-06-12T00:48:00.000Z	dacubuntu		yeah
2008-06-12T00:48:00.000Z	dacubuntu		i tried that
2008-06-12T00:49:00.000Z	dacubuntu		gparted isnt working properly
2008-06-12T00:49:00.000Z	HardDisk	dacubuntu	is this a vista partition?
2008-06-12T00:49:00.000Z	HardDisk	dacubuntu	I'd check the partition structure then.
2008-06-12T00:49:00.000Z	HardDisk	dacubuntu	gparted has no issues with xp partitions whatsoever
2008-06-12T00:49:00.000Z	HardDisk	dacubuntu	you could use Hiren's bootcd if you want
2008-06-12T00:50:00.000Z	HardDisk	dacubuntu	you have to unmount the drive if you're doing it via the OS
2008-06-12T00:50:00.000Z	HardDisk	dacubuntu	then I suspect a "dirty" partition table, check hiren's bootcd and do some tests
2008-06-12T00:51:00.000Z	HardDisk	dacubuntu	did you encrypt your drives?
2008-06-12T00:51:00.000Z	HardDisk	dacubuntu	regardless..
2008-06-12T00:53:00.000Z	HardDisk	dacubuntu	sure.
2008-06-12T01:28:00.000Z	HardDisk	dacubuntu	what happened?
2008-06-12T01:28:00.000Z	HardDisk	dacubuntu	I told you no need you had the entry already
2008-06-12T01:29:00.000Z	HardDisk	dacubuntu	as I said, you need to fix your partition errors
2008-06-12T01:29:00.000Z	HardDisk	dacubuntu	use chkdsk in windows or via the hirenbootcd I told you
2008-06-12T01:30:00.000Z	HardDisk	dacubuntu	still fix your partition errors before you play around mounting
