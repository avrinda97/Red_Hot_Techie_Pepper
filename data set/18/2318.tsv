2010-06-16T22:51:00.000Z	jaynon		Does anybody know why a portable drive would appear, mount, then a minute after i start it copying a few files to the desktop it disappears/unmounts on its own and gives an error? I'm using Parallels on OS X.
2010-06-16T22:52:00.000Z	thune3	jaynon	look at dmesg or /var/log/syslog, to see if you can get more info in the error
2010-06-16T22:56:00.000Z	jaynon	thune3	personally i can't make any sense of the output from dmesg, but i can depaste the last dozen lines or so and maybe you'll know what it means?
2010-06-16T22:57:00.000Z	thune3	jaynon	use a pastebin
2010-06-16T23:02:00.000Z	jaynon	thune3	http://pastebin.com/3QFhsjm0 this time it quit before i even started copying any files, just spontaneously
2010-06-16T23:07:00.000Z	thune3	jaynon	i'm looking into it. this is a WD external hard driver?
2010-06-16T23:07:00.000Z	jaynon	thune3	yes sir, i thought it was FAT formatted but i suspect it maybe Ext2 or 3 based on os x's disk utility info
2010-06-16T23:08:00.000Z	thune3	jaynon	you have external power source  connected?
2010-06-16T23:09:00.000Z	jaynon	thune3	it runs off the usb's power
2010-06-16T23:09:00.000Z	thune3	jaynon	well, does it alsow allow you to plug it in with an extra adapter?
2010-06-16T23:09:00.000Z	jaynon	thune3	well, there aren't any other places to plug anything into it
2010-06-16T23:12:00.000Z	thune3	jaynon	ok. that particular usb port being unable to power device while it's running  "might" explain it. does it do the same if you plug it into the back (or front, whatever is opposite to what you have) i'll check other possiblities....
2010-06-16T23:14:00.000Z	jaynon	thune3	it's a macbook so there are only two usb plugs on the side. Maybe there's a usb device powered by the wall socket that also has usb connections on it that i could connect this drive to?
2010-06-16T23:15:00.000Z	thune3	jaynon	i doubt this is the problem, but it couldn't hurt to try. i'm still looking at other stuf....
2010-06-16T23:28:00.000Z	thune3	jaynon	can you give me the exact model number of your external HDD?
2010-06-16T23:30:00.000Z	jaynon	thune3	it's called "Passport", "MyPassport" something like that, 500GB
2010-06-16T23:31:00.000Z	thune3	jaynon	ok thx
2010-06-16T23:34:00.000Z	jaynon	thune3	my passport essential, wd5000me
