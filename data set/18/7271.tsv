2008-09-16T14:43:00.000Z	ganesh	ActionParsnip	didn't get you
2008-09-16T14:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ganesh	just like tab completing anything in linux, you can tab complete package names when you are playing with apt-get
2008-10-11T23:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ganesh	in what way?
2008-10-11T23:10:00.000Z	ganesh	ActionParsnip	i installed windows on ubuntu and lost grub..
2008-10-11T23:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ganesh	you can reinstall grub from the live cd
2008-10-11T23:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ganesh	you need to reinstall grub then add the entry for windows
2008-10-11T23:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ganesh	yuo install it to the partition marked as active
2008-10-11T23:18:00.000Z	ganesh	ActionParsnip	how ll i know where mbr installed now?where can i see which partition is active? and what entry to be made in grub list?
2008-10-11T23:21:00.000Z	ganesh	ActionParsnip	how ll i know where mbr installed now?where can i see which partition is active? and what entry to be made in grub list?
2008-10-11T23:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ganesh	its all there
2009-01-13T15:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ganesh	boot to the burned cd like a normal install
2009-01-13T15:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ganesh	its a text based install and is very nice
2009-01-13T15:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ganesh	you need to be able to boot to some form of media to install, ask a buddy to download it for you and burn it, its 10Mb
2009-01-13T15:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ganesh	i think you can get grub to boot an iso, I'd store it on a seperate partition to the one you intend to install to
2009-05-06T15:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ganesh	sudo apt-get install vlc
2009-07-24T18:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ganesh	i recommend you run: sudo cp /boot/grub/menu.lst /boot/grub/menu.lst_old
2009-07-24T18:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ganesh	so if you mess things up you can roll back easily
