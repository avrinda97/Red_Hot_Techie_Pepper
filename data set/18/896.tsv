2011-08-04T12:06:00.000Z	linuxfreaker		Need some help on gcc
2011-08-04T12:07:00.000Z	linuxfreaker		I am using Ubuntu 11.10 Alpha
2011-08-04T12:07:00.000Z	linuxfreaker		Trying to install vmware-tools
2011-08-04T12:07:00.000Z	allandee	linuxfreaker	with what?
2011-08-04T12:10:00.000Z	allandee	linuxfreaker	which command line provokes the error?
2011-08-04T12:10:00.000Z	linuxfreaker	allandee	let me show u pastebin
2011-08-04T12:10:00.000Z	allandee	linuxfreaker	why does vmware-tools want to compile something?  what happens before this?
2011-08-04T12:13:00.000Z	allandee	linuxfreaker	sorry if I missed this, but have you "apt-get install gcc"?
2011-08-04T12:14:00.000Z	allandee	linuxfreaker	it will install the compiler, and I  believe automake and related m4 tools
2011-08-04T12:14:00.000Z	linuxfreaker	allandee	gcc already installed
2011-08-04T12:14:00.000Z	linuxfreaker	allandee	where exactly gcc binaries are located?
2011-08-04T12:15:00.000Z	linuxfreaker	allandee	yes
2011-08-04T12:17:00.000Z	allandee	linuxfreaker	only if it says "gcc: no input files"
2011-08-04T12:17:00.000Z	linuxfreaker	allandee	Shall i apt-get remove and install gcc again
2011-08-04T12:20:00.000Z	allandee	linuxfreaker	are you trying to invoke the compiler as root, also?  or as a regular user?
2011-08-04T12:24:00.000Z	allandee	linuxfreaker	from your pastebin it seems as if the vmware script doesn't find gcc at all, while it is in fact /usr/bin/gcc
2011-08-04T12:25:00.000Z	linuxfreaker	allandee	I tried removing build-essential and gcc and reinstalling but the same issue
2011-08-04T12:26:00.000Z	allandee	linuxfreaker	you can't move on until you determine for certain that 1) "gcc" is covered by what is in your PATH environment variable and that 2) the script doesn't obey your environment
