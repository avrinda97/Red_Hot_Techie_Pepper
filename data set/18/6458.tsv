2008-05-09T09:18:00.000Z	calebH	hacim	try gnome-default-applications-properties
2008-05-09T09:18:00.000Z	calebH	hacim	if you want more choices besides rhythmbox, you'll have to install some alternative players
2008-05-09T09:19:00.000Z	hacim	calebH	yeah, I did that, but that didn't work :(
2008-05-09T09:19:00.000Z	hacim	calebH	I have amarok installed...
2008-05-09T09:19:00.000Z	calebH	hacim	on my system I have the choice of banshee, rythmbox, totem, or custom (where you can type in a command)
2008-05-09T09:19:00.000Z	hacim	calebH	I changed mine to custom and typed amarok in the box
2008-05-09T09:20:00.000Z	hacim	calebH	but I am pretty sure its a nautilus config
2008-05-09T09:20:00.000Z	hacim	calebH	because if I go to Places->Home->edit->Preferences->Media
2008-05-09T09:21:00.000Z	calebH	hacim	what type of files do you want to auto-open in amarok?
2008-05-09T09:21:00.000Z	hacim	calebH	I only have rhythmbox as an option... if I disable it altogether, on insert of the device it asks me what to do
2008-05-09T09:21:00.000Z	hacim	calebH	on insert of an ipod
2008-05-09T09:21:00.000Z	calebH	hacim	hang on
2008-05-09T09:21:00.000Z	hacim	calebH	hanging on!
2008-05-09T09:23:00.000Z	calebH	hacim	shoot - I thought gnome-volume-properties might have mp3 players listed that would control that behavior but it's not there
2008-05-09T09:25:00.000Z	hacim	calebH	yeah, i am pretty sure its in nautilus somewhere, but I dont see how you can configure other applications
2008-05-09T09:25:00.000Z	calebH	hacim	have you tried to edit it in gconf-editor ?
2008-05-09T09:26:00.000Z	hacim	calebH	i haven't found anything in there for it, but maybe I missed it
2008-05-09T09:28:00.000Z	calebH	hacim	sorry man.  I don't have an iPod and I don't use amarok so I'm out of suggestions.  Good Luck!
