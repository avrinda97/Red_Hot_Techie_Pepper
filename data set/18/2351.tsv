2011-02-12T18:37:00.000Z	Odaym		if i have a regular Ubuntu, just a desktop edition
2011-02-12T18:37:00.000Z	Odaym		can i turn it into one of the Server line machines simply through certain packages?
2011-02-12T18:38:00.000Z	Seveas	Odaym	yes, just install the software you want. There's nothing special about server edition except for the package selection
2011-02-12T18:39:00.000Z	Seveas	Odaym	again, samba :)
2011-02-12T18:39:00.000Z	Seveas	Odaym	correct
2011-02-12T18:40:00.000Z	Seveas	Odaym	search for "samba domain controller", you can probably find something useful on help.ubuntu.com
2011-02-12T18:53:00.000Z	Seveas	Odaym	the f in `ps auxf` prints a tree of processes
2011-02-12T18:54:00.000Z	Seveas	Odaym	not in my experience, but if you do loads of IO (video editing for instance) it will
2011-02-12T19:04:00.000Z	Odaym	Seveas	i install OpenSSH client on my clients, and OpenSSH server on my server?
2011-02-12T19:04:00.000Z	Seveas	Odaym	that sounds reasonable
2011-02-12T19:05:00.000Z	Seveas	Odaym	scp, ssh, rsync... depends on what you want to do
2011-02-12T19:07:00.000Z	Seveas	Odaym	it does, and what llutz said means something completely different
2011-02-12T19:10:00.000Z	Seveas	Odaym	yes, but it has no effext
2011-02-12T19:15:00.000Z	Seveas	Odaym	yes :)
2011-02-12T19:16:00.000Z	Seveas	Odaym	SSD is basically a big flash drive, so no rotating disks
2011-12-24T03:16:00.000Z	Seveas	Odaym	generally not. The private key is not found there
2011-12-26T17:13:00.000Z	Seveas	Odaym	actually, this will work better: alias cd='cd "$1"; ls'
2011-12-26T17:14:00.000Z	Seveas	Odaym	no, llutz_ is not right. $1 doesn't get expanded in single quotes
