2006-05-26T07:42:00.000Z	scifi	Mr_GTi	u may want to wait until June 1st when the very latest version of ubuntu (dapper) is released
2006-05-26T07:43:00.000Z	scifi	Mr_GTi	i think itunes is so popular that people have managed to "hack" it and it does indeed run on linux
2006-05-26T07:45:00.000Z	scifi	Mr_GTi	ubuntu comes with a type of "database" of apps called repositories, which u can search and install at your leisure knowing that it will run perfectly on ur system, thats one of the main features i love about it
2006-05-26T07:47:00.000Z	scifi	Mr_GTi	17817 packages currently listed in databse :D
2006-05-26T07:50:00.000Z	scifi	Mr_GTi	as far as i know BT works fien on ubuntu
2006-05-26T07:54:00.000Z	scifi	Mr_GTi	alot of apps u can download and install all with one command like "sudo apt-get install "appname", just think how many mouse-clicks that would take in windows :)
