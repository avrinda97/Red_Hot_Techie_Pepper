2012-04-06T08:25:00.000Z	rinzler		If I am able to access files on a failing disk, would I be able to copy the files to another disk without loosing data?
2012-04-06T08:26:00.000Z	evildaemon	rinzler	Depends on if the blocks are corrupted. But in principle yes.
2012-04-06T08:27:00.000Z	rinzler	evildaemon	If blocks are corrupted, would a repair attempt damage my files?
2012-04-06T08:28:00.000Z	evildaemon	rinzler	I don't see why.
2012-04-06T08:28:00.000Z	rinzler	evildaemon	Ok. Thanks
2012-04-06T08:29:00.000Z	evildaemon	rinzler	Unless spinning the disks damages it or your program just starts doing random writes. Which doesn't seem likely.
2012-04-06T08:29:00.000Z	evildaemon		But yeah; I can't install MIT Scheme from the repos.
2012-04-06T08:29:00.000Z	rinzler	evildaemon	K. Thx
2012-04-06T08:31:00.000Z	rinzler		In disk utility, SMART status says "disk has a few bad sectors" how do I correct this?
2012-04-06T08:32:00.000Z	evildaemon	rinzler	Backup and buy a new one. It's too small to really repair.
2012-04-06T08:32:00.000Z	rinzler	evildaemon	metaspike: thanks
2012-04-06T08:34:00.000Z	rinzler		Would dd-ing my data across to a new drive keep everything intact?
2012-04-06T08:34:00.000Z	evildaemon	rinzler	Depends on the integrity of the disk image.
2012-04-06T08:34:00.000Z	evildaemon	rinzler	If you mess it up your screwed. Also you'll probably have to resize it for the new drive.
2012-04-06T08:35:00.000Z	evildaemon		!help
2012-04-06T08:36:00.000Z	evildaemon		Wrong bang.
2012-04-06T08:36:00.000Z	evildaemon		I wanted a list of options.
2012-04-06T08:36:00.000Z	rinzler	evildaemon	ok. What is the best way to preserve everything? Sadly it's the boot disk...
