2006-05-27T08:25:00.000Z	interprb		cant figure this one out. when i boot u-box our dns records show that the ubuntu box request an a record for hotmail.com. we dont use hotmail??
2006-05-27T08:26:00.000Z	interprb		no
2006-05-27T08:27:00.000Z	interprb		we see dns in real time
2006-05-27T08:27:00.000Z	Frogzoo	interprb	can you run ethereal from another box to capture a trace?
2006-05-27T08:28:00.000Z	Frogzoo	interprb	and nothing?
2006-05-27T08:28:00.000Z	Frogzoo	interprb	yes, but is there any mail sent? if so, which address? just looking for giveaway clues
2006-05-27T08:29:00.000Z	Frogzoo	interprb	so _some_ process looks up a hotmail address, but doesn't do anything with it? kinda wierd
2006-05-27T11:34:00.000Z	Frogzoo	interprb	at a guess, is the ip entered in firestarter's lists?
2006-05-27T11:35:00.000Z	Frogzoo	interprb	why is this a MAJOR problem?
2006-05-27T11:37:00.000Z	Frogzoo	interprb	you running a mail server?
2006-05-27T11:38:00.000Z	Frogzoo	interprb	try ethereal & see if it gives you a better idea what's generating it
2006-05-27T11:39:00.000Z	Frogzoo	interprb	maybe grep you web pages for the ip/address...
2006-05-27T11:41:00.000Z	Frogzoo	interprb	ubuntu doesn't touch hotmail - ergo, it's a local issue
2006-05-27T11:44:00.000Z	interprb	Frogzoo	when you say local , maybe a bad script i picked up?
2006-05-27T11:45:00.000Z	Frogzoo	interprb	there's the possibility you've been hacked/root kitted - basically, stock ubuntu won't touch hotmail, so it's something on your disk
2006-05-27T11:47:00.000Z	interprb	Frogzoo	thanks, where do i start looking ???
2006-05-27T11:48:00.000Z	Frogzoo	interprb	well, one option would be build a new machine, & move your data over
2006-05-27T11:56:00.000Z	interprb	Frogzoo	yea, but it could happen again. Thanks. I need to find out how. Will share if i find anything out. Thanks all!
