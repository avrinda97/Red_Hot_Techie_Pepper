2008-11-08T06:01:00.000Z	brandan_		does anyone know a disk defragger for ubuntu ? is there one in synaptic?
2008-11-08T06:02:00.000Z	brandan_		oh so u dont really gotta worry about it?
2008-11-08T06:03:00.000Z	brandan_		cool, i didn't know that
2008-11-08T06:03:00.000Z	brandan_		Would defragging my windows make ubuntu any faster?
2008-11-08T06:03:00.000Z	brandan_		yea i have dual boot
2008-11-08T06:04:00.000Z	brandan_		ooh okay
2008-11-08T06:06:00.000Z	brandan_		now, next question..maybe sound silly here, but like in windows, is there a option in ubuntu where i can make it turn off my hard drive when I leave my pc idle for so long?
2008-11-08T06:06:00.000Z	brandan_		while the pc staying running
2008-11-08T06:06:00.000Z	amdpox	brandan_	it should spin down the hard disk if there's no activity
2008-11-08T06:08:00.000Z	amdpox	brandan_	what do you mean by "shut the hard disk down"?
2008-11-08T06:09:00.000Z	brandan_	amdpox	in windows there is options to suspend your system after so many minutes, also to turn the screen off, and turn the hard disk off, and u can continue say "instant messaging" while your hard drive is off, but if say u open a folder with music "MP3" in it, it will turn it on to read it
2008-11-08T06:09:00.000Z	amdpox	brandan_	yes, that's spinning the drive down to save power/noise/heat
2008-11-08T06:09:00.000Z	brandan_	amdpox	i have never heard ubuntu do that..
2008-11-08T06:12:00.000Z	amdpox	brandan_	open a terminal and type "hdparm -I | grep Adv"
2008-11-08T06:15:00.000Z	brandan_	amdpox	so if I type y or Y in that terminal now it will put the drive(s) to stand by or sleep?
2008-11-08T06:15:00.000Z	amdpox	brandan_	it should just give you some output
2008-11-08T06:18:00.000Z	brandan_	amdpox	ya it shows info, but how can i make it does those commands it shows?
