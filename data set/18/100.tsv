2012-09-12T20:22:00.000Z	Guest31702		hello, trying to connect a sata ssd drive on an old ide motherboard using an adapter. the hard drive is recognized in bios and gparted but afer a random few seconds aprox. 1 minute ubuntu live cd freezes. any idea?
2012-09-12T20:22:00.000Z	compdoc	Guest31702	its obvious it wont work
2012-09-12T20:23:00.000Z	Guest31702	compdoc	, why do you say that?
2012-09-12T20:23:00.000Z	compdoc	Guest31702	test it further - try to install windows or some other OS
2012-09-12T20:24:00.000Z	Guest31702	compdoc	, do you think it may be an electrical problem?
2012-09-12T20:24:00.000Z	compdoc	Guest31702	i think those apadters are unreliable
2012-09-12T20:24:00.000Z	compdoc		*adapters
2012-09-12T20:26:00.000Z	Guest31702	compdoc	, i guess im starting to have that idea too
2012-09-12T20:26:00.000Z	compdoc	Guest31702	you could try a pci controller
2012-09-12T20:27:00.000Z	Guest31702	compdoc	, would i get the same speed as with the ide adapter?
2012-09-12T20:28:00.000Z	compdoc	Guest31702	I think you would get a lot better performance, as long as the adapter is supported by ubuntu.
2012-09-12T20:28:00.000Z	compdoc	Guest31702	but youre better off with a new motherboard
2012-09-12T20:29:00.000Z	compdoc	Guest31702	SSD drives are better off with more modern equipment
2012-09-12T20:32:00.000Z	Guest31702	compdoc	,  ssd drives consume less than ide. im trying to connect a sata ssd to an ide motherboard. aint the sata ssd receiving more volts than required?

2012-09-12T20:33:00.000Z	compdoc	Guest31702	ssd use the same voltages as any other drive
2012-09-12T20:33:00.000Z	compdoc		they just consume less
2012-09-12T20:34:00.000Z	Guest31702	compdoc	, so that s it . thanks
