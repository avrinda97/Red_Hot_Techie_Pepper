2007-11-30T08:33:00.000Z	Phantombun		I don't want to totally crap up my laptop and have to reformat
2007-11-30T08:34:00.000Z	Phantombun		xp home sp2
2007-11-30T08:34:00.000Z	Phantombun		I defragmented and backed up data like you guys told me to earlier
2007-11-30T08:34:00.000Z	Phantombun		now i'm ready
2007-11-30T08:35:00.000Z	Phantombun		I'm only giving linux 10-15 gigs
2007-11-30T08:35:00.000Z	Phantombun		So, where do I start?
2007-11-30T08:36:00.000Z	Phantombun		my friend is telling me that i'm gonna mess everything up installing this on my laptop
2007-11-30T08:36:00.000Z	Phantombun		now i'm worried :S
2007-11-30T08:36:00.000Z	corruptionoflulz	Phantombun	you COULD backup first...
2007-11-30T08:37:00.000Z	corruptionoflulz	Phantombun	the ubuntu installer will resize the partitions for you (defrag is recommended)
2007-11-30T08:38:00.000Z	corruptionoflulz	Phantombun	do you have any important data that would be good to back up? just to make you feel safer..
2007-11-30T08:39:00.000Z	corruptionoflulz	Phantombun	not likely, but i backed up before i did it, just for peace of mind.. never used the backup though
2007-11-30T08:40:00.000Z	corruptionoflulz	Phantombun	as long as you don't overwrite things.
2007-11-30T08:41:00.000Z	corruptionoflulz	Phantombun	easiest way is to just let it resize it for you
2007-11-30T08:43:00.000Z	corruptionoflulz	Phantombun	take a screen shot, and put it on www.imageshack.us
2007-11-30T08:43:00.000Z	corruptionoflulz	Phantombun	there should be a slider thingy for resizing...
