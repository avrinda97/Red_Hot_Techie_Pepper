2005-01-08T07:45:00.000Z	grepper	marjorie	I haven't followed this discussion, but you know you can add wireless commands to /etc/network/interfaces ?
2005-01-08T07:46:00.000Z	grepper	marjorie	"man wireless" will give examples of commands you can use I think
2005-01-08T07:48:00.000Z	marjorie	grepper	k will do
2005-01-08T07:51:00.000Z	grepper	marjorie	well, the question was how to stop it
2005-01-08T07:56:00.000Z	marjorie	grepper	its ok to put bash commands in /etc/network/interfaces ?
2005-01-08T07:56:00.000Z	grepper	marjorie	did you read "man wireless" ?
2005-01-08T08:04:00.000Z	grepper	marjorie	it would have nice pictures
2005-01-08T08:24:00.000Z	marjorie	grepper	is there any log for /etc/network/interfaces ?
