2007-04-09T05:45:00.000Z	yellow_chicken	PriceChild	you want to md5sum a burnt cd?
2007-04-09T05:45:00.000Z	PriceChild	yellow_chicken	yeah :)
2007-04-09T05:45:00.000Z	yellow_chicken	PriceChild	md5sum /dev/hdc   , where hdc is your cdrom
2007-04-09T05:46:00.000Z	PriceChild	yellow_chicken	aha! :) /dev/cdrom0 didn't work for me so gave up with that idea :)
2007-04-09T05:46:00.000Z	yellow_chicken	PriceChild	not /dev/cdrom0, do it on dev/hdc or hdd
2007-04-09T05:46:00.000Z	PriceChild	yellow_chicken	yup, thanks very much! :)
2007-04-09T05:47:00.000Z	PriceChild	yellow_chicken	simple things :)
2007-04-09T05:54:00.000Z	PriceChild	yellow_chicken	bah md5sum: /dev/hdd: Input/output error
2007-04-09T05:55:00.000Z	yellow_chicken	PriceChild	maybe /dev/hdc ?  you have to use your cdrom device, most likely, hdc or hdd
2007-04-09T05:55:00.000Z	PriceChild	yellow_chicken	no definitely hdd
2007-04-09T05:55:00.000Z	PriceChild	yellow_chicken	I think its a bad disc anyway but I've got another idea. Thanks :)
2007-04-09T05:56:00.000Z	yellow_chicken	PriceChild	it works for me,  i did md5sum /dev/hdc before
2007-04-09T05:59:00.000Z	yellow_chicken	PriceChild	you 've already mount hdd before you type in that command?
