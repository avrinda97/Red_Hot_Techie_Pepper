2006-10-20T05:04:00.000Z	agent		what command does one use to find out which package owns a certain file on a system?
2006-10-20T05:04:00.000Z	LjL	agent	dpkg -S filename
2006-10-20T05:04:00.000Z	agent	LjL	thank you!
2006-10-20T05:19:00.000Z	LjL	agent	i'm not sure... i guess files in /etc/default may get created by the postinst script. i guess the package that's actually responsible for that file is console-setup anyway
2006-10-20T05:20:00.000Z	agent	LjL	yes it is... thank you again... i just backed up the file and ran reconfigure (see my msg above)
2006-11-18T11:27:00.000Z	LjL	agent	you do need to use "ar", since a .deb is an ar archive
2006-11-18T11:28:00.000Z	agent	LjL	crap! system does not have ar :( any other way? does any other common program extract ar archives?
2006-11-18T11:28:00.000Z	LjL	agent	i don't know, honestly i doubt it somehow...
2006-11-18T11:29:00.000Z	agent	LjL	do you know if debootstrap requires ar?
2006-11-18T11:30:00.000Z	LjL	agent	the package debootstrap has "binutils" as a dependency, and binutils is the package that provides /usr/bin/ar
2006-11-18T11:30:00.000Z	agent	LjL	yeah, i know :`(
2006-11-18T11:31:00.000Z	LjL	agent	what're you trying to do? can't you for instance just obtain a binary copy of ar?
2006-11-18T11:32:00.000Z	agent	LjL	doing the "impossible" - installing linux (ubuntu) on a computer without monitor, keyboard, mouse, internet, usb, etc. :D
2006-11-18T11:32:00.000Z	LjL	agent	well, from the opposite perspective - what do you *have*?
2006-11-18T11:33:00.000Z	agent	LjL	ill just "cheat" and use ar from the connected computer :P - thats the only thing that i have, a bootable cd (without dpkg or ar - hah!) and this computer connected to it
2006-11-18T11:39:00.000Z	agent	LjL	thank you for your help and suggestions
2006-12-15T08:58:00.000Z	agent	LjL	i somehow missed your answer and just read: "<LjL> i suspect he was thinking" and thought to my self, "i sure hope he was thinking!" ;)
2006-12-15T08:59:00.000Z	LjL	agent	well, that wasn't what i meant, but you shouldn't take that sort of thing for granted anyway ;P
