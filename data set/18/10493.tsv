2007-02-26T09:37:00.000Z	whta		i'm trying! see, i tried to install rollercoaster tycoon. but then i wanted to uninstall it so it didn't work. so, not seeing any uninstall exe anywhere, i just deleted it. then i later discovered the wine programs now under applications (that wasn't there in the older version!) and it had the uninstall option. so i tried to reinstall it so i could uninstall it. but that didn't work. so i tried to completely remove wine via synaptic an
2007-02-26T09:37:00.000Z	whta		and :(
2007-02-26T09:38:00.000Z	kjm	whta	 - look for a .wine file in ~/
2007-02-26T09:38:00.000Z	whta	kjm	i tried but that folder is hidden?
2007-02-26T09:39:00.000Z	kjm		yes, but can be found using ls -la
2007-02-26T09:39:00.000Z	kjm		and try $rm .wine and start again.
2007-02-26T09:40:00.000Z	whta	kjm	i tried "rm ~/.wine/" and that didn't work. what should i fix?
2007-02-26T09:40:00.000Z	kjm	whta	- rm -rf ~/.wine
2007-02-26T09:41:00.000Z	whta	kjm	that worked, but the wine programs folder is still under applications
2007-02-26T09:41:00.000Z	kjm		did you remove wine via synaptic?
2007-02-26T09:41:00.000Z	whta	kjm	yes, i marked it for COMPLETE removal
2007-02-26T09:41:00.000Z	kjm		then, should be fine - reinstall and try again with RC tycoon
2007-02-26T09:43:00.000Z	kjm		IndyGunFrea - I have no idea.  Don't play them.
2007-02-26T09:44:00.000Z	whta	kjm	i just installed and uninstalled rct AGAIN, but it STILL shows up under wine programs
2007-02-26T09:45:00.000Z	kjm	whta	- yes.  Wine doesn't necessarily do cleanup for you - Windows uninstalls are inherently dirty.  Why are you installing to uninstall?  Just rm the directory.
2007-02-26T09:47:00.000Z	whta	kjm	i'm pretty noob still with all this so I'm not quite sure exactly what goes on behind what I'm trying to do. I WOULD have deleted that directory if i knew where it was, but for now I just deleted it via menu layout
2007-02-26T09:47:00.000Z	kjm	whta	- usually these things are stored in ~/wine/Programs or something.  Use locate at the command line to find it.
