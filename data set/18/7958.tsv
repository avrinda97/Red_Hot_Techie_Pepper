2007-10-20T23:14:00.000Z	undergroundman		wtf?
2007-10-20T23:14:00.000Z	undergroundman		shutup
2007-10-20T23:15:00.000Z	undergroundman		so I have this Live Ubuntu CD
2007-10-20T23:15:00.000Z	undergroundman		I put it in and looked for wireless networks
2007-10-20T23:15:00.000Z	undergroundman		on Windows there's about 6 of them
2007-10-20T23:15:00.000Z	undergroundman		in Ubuntu, none of them show up
2007-10-20T23:15:00.000Z	scguy318	undergroundman	but wireless isn't working on Ubuntu, what card do you have?
2007-10-20T23:17:00.000Z	scguy318	undergroundman	what card do you have?
2007-10-20T23:17:00.000Z	scguy318	undergroundman	what card do you have?
2007-10-20T23:19:00.000Z	scguy318	undergroundman	can you please pastebin the output of lspci?
2007-10-20T23:20:00.000Z	scguy318	undergroundman	Terminal command
2007-10-20T23:20:00.000Z	scguy318	undergroundman	I suspect you'll have to use ndiswrapper in any case
2007-10-20T23:20:00.000Z	scguy318	undergroundman	I think your card is a Broadcom, though I think Gutsy has restricted firmware for your thing, though I could be dead wrong
2007-10-20T23:20:00.000Z	scguy318	undergroundman	System -> Administration -> Restricted Driver Manager yield anything?
2007-10-20T23:21:00.000Z	scguy318	undergroundman	ah
2007-10-20T23:22:00.000Z	undergroundman	scguy318	An ethernet cable is very inconvenient from where I am
2007-10-20T23:22:00.000Z	scguy318	undergroundman	I suppose you can install now, then you can use a guide that I will link you to for ndiswrapper
2007-10-20T23:22:00.000Z	scguy318	undergroundman	Gutsy or Feisty?
