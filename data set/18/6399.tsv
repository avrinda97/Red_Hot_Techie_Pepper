2008-05-29T00:43:00.000Z	nibsa1242b		Any advice with regards to lack of sound when watching flash videos?
2008-05-29T00:44:00.000Z	Steve-cal	nibsa1242b	Are you using the Adobe flash plugin or something else?
2008-05-29T00:45:00.000Z	nibsa1242b	Steve-cal	I'm pretty sure its the official Adobe flash plugin. about:plugins reports it as libflashplayer.so & npwrapper.libflashplayer.so
2008-05-29T00:48:00.000Z	nibsa1242b	Steve-cal	should I be concerned that I seem to have both Flah 9.0 r48 & Flash 9.0 r31 installed at the same time under about:plugins
2008-05-29T00:49:00.000Z	Steve-cal	nibsa1242b	Seems like that could be an issue! :) You only need one.
2008-05-29T00:49:00.000Z	nibsa1242b	Steve-cal	ok, I'll see what happens if I remove one.
2008-05-29T00:52:00.000Z	Steve-cal	nibsa1242b	BTW, my version is "9.0 r124" and I believe I got it through the repositories--you may want to upgrade yours.
2008-05-29T00:53:00.000Z	nibsa1242b	Steve-cal	I'm thinking the best way to do that would be to sudo apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree right? I don't currently have that package installed.
2008-05-29T00:54:00.000Z	Steve-cal	nibsa1242b	I originally installed it thru the repos--how did you install yours originally?
2008-05-29T00:54:00.000Z	nibsa1242b	Steve-cal	I think I went to a flash page, and I let firefox install the plugin.
2008-05-29T01:00:00.000Z	nibsa1242b	Steve-cal	ok, now I'm showing flash 9.0 r48, r 31, AND r124. I wonder how to get rid of r48 & r31
2008-05-29T01:01:00.000Z	Steve-cal	nibsa1242b	That's a really good question. I've never had to mess with uninstalling multiple plugins.
2008-05-29T01:03:00.000Z	nibsa1242b	Steve-cal	I'll go ask in the mozilla irc channel
2008-05-29T01:04:00.000Z	Steve-cal	nibsa1242b	Good idea. Stop by here again and let us know if you get it working. :)
2008-05-29T01:15:00.000Z	nibsa1242b	Steve-cal	Ok, problem fixed. I had 2 versions of Flash installed to my /home/.mozilla/plugins/ directory. After removing them, and installing the plugin from the repo I now have sound during Flash videos.
2008-05-29T01:16:00.000Z	Steve-cal	nibsa1242b	Great! So you just manually removed the files in the plugins directory? No special uninstallation necessary?
2008-05-29T01:18:00.000Z	nibsa1242b	Steve-cal	yeah, just a manual deleting was all that was necessary. I did have to go into about:config and change plugin.expose_full_path to true so that I knew where the 3 versions were. And I happen to be running firefox 2.0.0.14.
2008-05-29T01:19:00.000Z	Steve-cal	nibsa1242b	I'll have to remember that trick. I'm using FF2 also.
