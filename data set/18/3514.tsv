2011-10-09T22:36:00.000Z	theadmin	edwardpatch	Don't you listen at all? Install the corefonts.
2011-10-09T22:37:00.000Z	theadmin	edwardpatch	No need for winetricks... sudo apt-get install ttf-mscorefonts-installer
2011-10-09T22:38:00.000Z	theadmin	edwardpatch	It installs the standard Windows fonts
2011-10-09T22:39:00.000Z	theadmin	edwardpatch	It will go to /usr/share/fonts, wine will still it from there, stop asking questions and JUST DO IT AND TELL US IF IT WORKS
2011-10-13T20:28:00.000Z	theadmin	edwardpatch	It's a hidden folder
2011-10-13T20:29:00.000Z	theadmin	edwardpatch	Enable showing those
2011-10-13T20:29:00.000Z	theadmin	edwardpatch	Just forget about it then
