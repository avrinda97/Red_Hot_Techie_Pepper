2007-01-05T07:25:00.000Z	somerville32	elyon	How so?
2007-01-05T07:26:00.000Z	somerville32	elyon	wyld: Xubuntu is the only thing I have installed. :)
2007-01-05T07:27:00.000Z	somerville32	elyon	What problems have you been having?
2007-01-05T07:27:00.000Z	somerville32	elyon	Let me try :)
2007-01-05T07:28:00.000Z	somerville32	elyon	Open a private query with me so that we don't need to be distracted by the traffic in here :)
2007-01-05T07:28:00.000Z	elyon	somerville32	 Okay, well there are two problems I'm currently having.  First, my mp3 player, card reader, and digital camera can no longer be mounted.
