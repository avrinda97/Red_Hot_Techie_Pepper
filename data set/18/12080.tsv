2006-09-18T10:45:00.000Z	kkaisare	SurfnKid	Impressive. I haven't had any luck in that regard.
2006-09-18T10:45:00.000Z	SurfnKid	kkaisare	haha, he uses unix so he needs a linux environment
2006-09-18T10:46:00.000Z	kkaisare	SurfnKid	That explains a lot. FUD still rules the Real World.
2006-09-18T10:47:00.000Z	SurfnKid	kkaisare	exactly
2006-09-18T10:49:00.000Z	kkaisare	SurfnKid	Interestingly though, I find Ubuntu installations ridiculously simple now - definitely as easy as, if not easier than, Windows XP Professional Edition.
2006-09-18T10:50:00.000Z	kkaisare	SurfnKid	And Synaptic makes getting new applications a matter of standard operating procedure.
2006-09-18T10:50:00.000Z	SurfnKid	kkaisare	yeah, now im not afraid of making a linux partition, i was a wreck when it came to one before

2006-09-18T10:52:00.000Z	SurfnKid	kkaisare	hehe, get a 64 or 128, thatll work sweet
2006-09-18T10:54:00.000Z	kkaisare	SurfnKid	I don't earn much, but I am saving towards a couple of nice 15 inch flatscreen TFTs

2006-09-18T10:55:00.000Z	kkaisare	SurfnKid	Sure, drop in after about two years or so, I will have saved enough by then. ;)
