2010-07-16T12:46:00.000Z	CkhiKuzad		is there a way to test to see if my video card is OpenGL compatible?
2010-07-16T12:47:00.000Z	rsk	CkhiKuzad	glxinfo
2010-07-16T12:48:00.000Z	CkhiKuzad	rsk	i get none and slow. so apparently its not.
2010-07-16T12:48:00.000Z	rsk	CkhiKuzad	so why did you even ask?
2010-07-16T12:48:00.000Z	rsk	CkhiKuzad	if you already knew the answear?
2010-07-16T12:48:00.000Z	CkhiKuzad	rsk	i did that command and got that.
2010-07-16T12:49:00.000Z	rsk	CkhiKuzad	there is no possibility the output was "none and slow"
2010-07-16T12:50:00.000Z	rsk	CkhiKuzad	you just don't know howto read the output
2010-07-16T12:50:00.000Z	rsk	CkhiKuzad	don't presume things
2010-07-16T12:51:00.000Z	CkhiKuzad	rsk	my computer is 9 years old.
2010-07-16T12:51:00.000Z	rsk	CkhiKuzad	so?
2010-07-16T12:51:00.000Z	rsk	CkhiKuzad	compatible with that?
2010-07-16T12:51:00.000Z	CkhiKuzad	rsk	OpenGL.  i will pastebin the results from the command.
2010-07-16T12:56:00.000Z	CkhiKuzad	rsk	http://pastebin.com/2XPzZLR4
2010-07-16T12:57:00.000Z	rsk	CkhiKuzad	 it can do openGL but it's one of the slowest cards ever produced
2010-07-16T12:58:00.000Z	CkhiKuzad	rsk	so in other words, if i use OpenGL, i will get buttloads of lag, like when i use KDE?
2010-07-16T12:58:00.000Z	rsk	CkhiKuzad	probably
2010-07-16T12:59:00.000Z	rsk	CkhiKuzad	anything using the intelcard will be slow
