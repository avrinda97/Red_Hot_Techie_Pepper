2009-10-31T11:40:00.000Z	voraistos	GJLenon	come on, DirectX is the only good thing Microsoft ever produced
2009-10-31T11:43:00.000Z	GJLenon	voraistos	 I contest that any product which controls the entire market is bad.  Competition is what creates excellence.  Look at US airports.  Without healthy competition, the standards have gone down hill.  While I agree that DirectX has done some amazing things, at some point it will begin to stagnate variable media.  Look at all the advances in console gaming.  When was the last time you saw a TRULY innovative PC game?
2009-10-31T11:45:00.000Z	voraistos	GJLenon	PC games suck because their devs have no imagination. DirectX is superior to their only true competition, openGl-based, what-we-use-on-linux SDL and SDL sucks, even on linux. Things like UT run better on wine that they do with SDL linux binaries :O
2009-10-31T11:48:00.000Z	GJLenon	voraistos	 I'm thinking about the 80's and 90's, with games back then.  Sierra was a master at pushing out games of quality, but so were a myriad of other companies.  These days there are only three or four major PC game manufacturers.  There are dozens for console games.  You cannot tell me this has nothing to do with DirectX and it's insane licensing policies.
2009-10-31T11:50:00.000Z	voraistos	GJLenon	then they can use something else! But non-one is interested. DirectX offered higher  everything, and it's supported by a big company. Remember that the company that created OpenGL went bust. I'm not even sure who's in charge of it nowadays.
2009-10-31T11:51:00.000Z	voraistos	GJLenon	There was also another 3D standard deveopped by 3dfx. While I loved these cards, Many games didn't work with them
2009-10-31T11:51:00.000Z	voraistos	GJLenon	with a bit of hacking that should be possible
2009-10-31T11:52:00.000Z	voraistos	GJLenon	the thing is you have to make sure absolutely everything has to be replaced, so good luck. Even config files would need changing for it to work
2009-10-31T11:55:00.000Z	voraistos	GJLenon	shouldn't be a problem. Just get rid of all the config files/dirs in the /home dir though
2009-10-31T11:57:00.000Z	GJLenon	voraistos	 Sorry to be ignorant, but how will I know if it is conflicting?
2009-10-31T11:58:00.000Z	voraistos	GJLenon	it probably will. I'm sure your config isn't irreplaceable, just keep your Music, movies and stuff, remove the rest
2009-10-31T11:59:00.000Z	GJLenon	voraistos	 Bleh, ok.
2009-10-31T11:59:00.000Z	voraistos	GJLenon	It's just that I have no idea how the installer will handle it.
2009-10-31T11:59:00.000Z	GJLenon	voraistos	 Ok.  Thanks for the advice, I appreciate it.
2009-10-31T12:00:00.000Z	voraistos	GJLenon	also keep in mind the default for 9.10 is ext4. I don't know what it is you've got now
2009-10-31T12:00:00.000Z	GJLenon	voraistos	 I dunno.  I'll probably reformat the drive anyway.
2009-10-31T12:12:00.000Z	voraistos	GJLenon	One servers have some sort of bug related to the previous client or something, that's why we can't use it
2009-10-31T12:13:00.000Z	GJLenon	voraistos	 Ahh, ok.   Thanks again for the help. :)
