2007-02-03T16:13:00.000Z	NET||abuse		Hi all, can someone help me? i want to remove a package without removing the dependant packages.
2007-02-03T16:15:00.000Z	aoupi	NET||abuse	dpkg-reconfigure postfix?
2007-02-03T16:16:00.000Z	NET||abuse	aoupi	nope,, it won't fix certain files which i want it to fix, i've also downlaoded and extracted the deb file and just replaced the postfix-script, postfix-files and post-install files, but they're not quite right, i need to run the install from clean again
2007-02-03T16:16:00.000Z	NET||abuse	aoupi	so i just need to know how to completely strip out postfix alone and not it's dependant package (courier in this case)
2007-02-03T16:17:00.000Z	aoupi	NET||abuse	apt-get --reinstall?
2007-02-03T16:17:00.000Z	NET||abuse	aoupi	doesn't strip out the package completely, it doesn't replace the postfix-files postfifx-script or post-install files in /etc/postfix either
2007-02-03T16:17:00.000Z	aoupi	NET||abuse	hm try --reinstall and --purge
2007-02-03T16:18:00.000Z	NET||abuse	aoupi	ok, i'll try
2007-02-03T16:18:00.000Z	aoupi	NET||abuse	just be quick on ctrl+c if it starts to do something crazy :)
2007-02-03T16:19:00.000Z	NET||abuse	aoupi	doesn't seem to delete the files
2007-02-03T16:20:00.000Z	aoupi	NET||abuse	are you sure the files are coming from postfix and not from postfix-something?
2007-02-03T16:21:00.000Z	NET||abuse	aoupi	so if that's an indication, i guess they are from postfix package, also dpkg -l | grep postfix reveals only one package
2007-02-03T16:22:00.000Z	aoupi	NET||abuse	ok, but can't you just copy the conf files from the .deb manualy?
2007-02-03T16:23:00.000Z	NET||abuse	aoupi	i did copy them from the deb, that didn't work as postfix started producing errors in log from postfix-script of "permission denied" and "file not found"
2007-02-03T16:24:00.000Z	aoupi	NET||abuse	hm, I'd backup the conf files of the dependencies and then let it purge their files and then reinstall them
2007-02-03T16:25:00.000Z	aoupi	NET||abuse	yes, do as Flannel says, seems to be less headache
2007-02-04T17:36:00.000Z	NET||abuse	aoupi	hey man, so i went and purged potfix, allowing it to remove courier-imap and courier-pop along iwth courier-imap-ssl and courier-pop-ssl,,
2007-02-04T17:36:00.000Z	NET||abuse	aoupi	but now when i restart postfix i get shell-init: error retrieving current directory: getcwd: cannot access parent directories: No such file or directory
