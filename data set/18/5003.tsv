2009-01-02T05:07:00.000Z	Artelus		ok
2009-01-02T05:07:00.000Z	Artelus		I can't get the partitioner to work
2009-01-02T05:07:00.000Z	scunizi_	Artelus	are you trying to install ubuntu or do something else?
2009-01-02T05:08:00.000Z	scunizi_	Artelus	did you start the install after windows was booted? or did you boot directly to the live cd?
2009-01-02T05:09:00.000Z	scunizi_	Artelus	and do you you want to create a dual boot machine or just have Ubuntu on the entire thing?
2009-01-02T05:10:00.000Z	scunizi_	Artelus	when you got to the partitioning portion of the install did you choose "Guided" or automatic or what?
2009-01-02T05:11:00.000Z	scunizi_	Artelus	so there were two partitions when you started? or you created one extra partition?  Is windows installed now?
2009-01-02T05:13:00.000Z	scunizi_	Artelus	so can you see both partitions from inside windows?
2009-01-02T05:14:00.000Z	scunizi_	Artelus	is this a laptop?
2009-01-02T05:15:00.000Z	scunizi_	Artelus	ok.. when you get back to the live cd and run the installer.. when you get to the partitioner the first option is pretty much an automatic install option. choose that.. and it will do the partition for you.
2009-01-02T05:16:00.000Z	scunizi_	Artelus	you might have to choose the largest partition you have to put ubuntu on (or partition some space for ubuntu on it.)
2009-01-02T05:18:00.000Z	scunizi_	Artelus	why?  you could use windows to create a partition just don't format it. Leave it as unpartitined space.. when ubuntu installs it will use that space and actually do another partition, one for install and one for swap
2009-01-02T05:19:00.000Z	scunizi_	Artelus	with windows ..? yes..
2009-01-02T05:21:00.000Z	scunizi_	Artelus	just remember that one single harddrive can't have any more than 4 primary partitions.. if you need more then the 4th one needs to be an "extended" partition and then more can be created inside of that.
