2006-03-10T16:38:00.000Z	lwelyn		i need some advise. If i start a programm like neverwinternights( it can be every 3d open gl proram ) how can im inimize it and return back to the desktop or switch to another workind table?
2006-03-10T16:38:00.000Z	lwelyn		The standart shortcuts dont work here. the only way to minimize it i find out i put i na cd  :-I
2006-03-10T16:39:00.000Z	soundray	lwelyn	do you need to do this often?
2006-03-10T16:39:00.000Z	lwelyn	soundray	yes.
2006-03-10T16:40:00.000Z	soundray	lwelyn	1 min
2006-03-10T16:42:00.000Z	soundray	lwelyn	you can minimize it with 'killall -s STOP neverwinternights'. You just have to tie this command to a hotkey that isn't swallowed by neverwinternights.
2006-03-10T16:43:00.000Z	soundray	lwelyn	you may be interested in the xbindkeys package.
2006-03-10T16:44:00.000Z	soundray	lwelyn	can you switch to a text console with Ctrl-Alt-F1 when nwn is running?
2006-03-10T16:44:00.000Z	soundray	lwelyn	it's not capturing every key then ;)
2006-03-10T16:45:00.000Z	soundray	lwelyn	you could try if this works by logging in on the console and issuing the killall command above.
2006-03-10T16:51:00.000Z	lwelyn	soundray	it takes really all combos :-(
2006-03-10T16:52:00.000Z	soundray	lwelyn	but that's good news, isn't it?
2006-03-10T16:53:00.000Z	lwelyn	soundray	it isnt good :-I .... i cant define a key combo...
2006-03-10T16:54:00.000Z	soundray	lwelyn	oh, I see, it captures them all.
2006-03-10T16:54:00.000Z	soundray	lwelyn	file a bug against nwn then...
2006-03-10T16:54:00.000Z	lwelyn	soundray	its the same with ut2k4
2006-03-10T16:56:00.000Z	soundray	lwelyn	you mentioned above something that minimizes it without your intervention -- remind me what that was pls.
2006-03-10T16:58:00.000Z	lwelyn	soundray	well if i run a 3d pengl prog i cant switch destops
