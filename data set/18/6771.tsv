2008-03-29T03:48:00.000Z	bazhang	pharoh	ubuntu-restricted-extras for a start; automatix is a huge mistake
2008-03-29T03:49:00.000Z	bazhang	pharoh	vlc is fine, but you still need the codecs; perhaps also add win32codecs from medibuntu
2008-03-29T03:51:00.000Z	bazhang	pharoh	sudo apt-get install ubuntu-restricted-extras  then go to www.medibuntu.org for instructions on how to install libdvdcss2 and win32codecs
2008-03-29T03:55:00.000Z	bazhang	pharoh	then enable the repos in synaptic hit refresh and then try again
2008-03-29T03:59:00.000Z	bazhang	pharoh	nicely done ;]
2008-03-29T04:06:00.000Z	bazhang	pharoh	you need to tab the agreement
2008-03-29T04:07:00.000Z	bazhang	pharoh	tab to the agree/ok and then hit enter
2008-03-29T04:29:00.000Z	pharoh	bazhang	hey is this the right way to install emerald:sudo apt-get install emerald? en how do i get it up en running?
2008-04-07T16:57:00.000Z	bazhang	pharoh	sudo apt-get install packagename in this case build-essential
