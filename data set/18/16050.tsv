2004-11-23T08:47:00.000Z	labanux		FATAL: Error inserting apm (/lib/modules/2.6.8.1-3-386/kernel/arch/i386/kernel/apm.ko): No such device
2004-11-23T08:47:00.000Z	labanux		that's the error message..
2004-11-23T08:47:00.000Z	kingkevbo	labanux	 Is APM turned off in your BIOS?
2004-11-23T08:50:00.000Z	labanux	kingkevbo	so.., i must turn on the apm on my bios setting..?
2004-11-23T08:51:00.000Z	kingkevbo	labanux	 Well, it could be that APM is turned off in the BIOS, or like bob2 said, your BIOS could be ACPI-compliant
2004-11-23T08:52:00.000Z	labanux	kingkevbo	acpi compliant..??
2004-11-23T08:54:00.000Z	kingkevbo	labanux	 There are 2 types of power management used by PCs:  APM and ACPI
2004-11-23T08:55:00.000Z	labanux	kingkevbo	so how can i know which type does my computer use?
2004-11-23T08:57:00.000Z	kingkevbo	labanux	 Check in your BIOS..... Usually there will be a place where you can turn on APM/ACPI.....That will tell you which one you have
2004-11-23T09:03:00.000Z	kingkevbo	labanux	 looks as if your power management has been turned off in the BIOS
