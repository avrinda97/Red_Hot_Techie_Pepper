2010-03-10T18:32:00.000Z	lao5	nibbler	sorry, what 's main (first) user?
2010-03-10T18:33:00.000Z	nibbler	lao5	the user you created while installing ubuntu
2010-03-10T18:33:00.000Z	lao5	nibbler	yeah
2010-03-10T18:34:00.000Z	nibbler	lao5	then i am sorry, but have no idea :|
2010-03-10T18:34:00.000Z	lao5	nibbler	:-( , that's ok.
2010-03-10T18:34:00.000Z	lao5	nibbler	maybe i need to reboot.
2010-03-10T18:36:00.000Z	nibbler	lao5	there is not many things that really do require a reboot, its maybe worth a try but.... i dont believe so
2010-03-10T18:37:00.000Z	nibbler	lao5	you talk about rightclicking on the clock in the upper right corner, adujust date&time, set system time by the way?
2010-03-10T18:37:00.000Z	lao5	nibbler	yeah
2010-03-10T18:38:00.000Z	nibbler	lao5	i'm not so sure, but for me it looks like your user could lack sudo rights, which i dont believe. you have other problems like this when doing system updates, installs etc?
2010-03-10T18:38:00.000Z	lao5	nibbler	not yet.
2010-03-10T18:39:00.000Z	lao5	nibbler	i could use sudo in the terminal
2010-03-10T18:39:00.000Z	nibbler	lao5	assumed so :\ well, maybe for now, use other means to change your time setup? what do you want to achive?
2010-03-10T18:40:00.000Z	lao5	nibbler	yeah. i want to see why the button disabled.
2010-03-10T18:41:00.000Z	nibbler	lao5	use the source, luke ;-)
2010-03-10T18:41:00.000Z	lao5	nibbler	oh. thanks.
