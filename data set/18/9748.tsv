2007-09-17T10:48:00.000Z	dn4		I just deleted a file using a gui does that automatically clear up the space on the hdd or do I have to empty some recycle bin?
2007-09-17T10:48:00.000Z	marx2k	dn4	depends if you put it in the trash or deleted it

2007-09-19T11:14:00.000Z	marx2k	dn4	you mean pricewise?
2007-09-19T11:15:00.000Z	dn4	marx2k	yes, i'm wondering because quad and triple cores are coming out
2007-09-19T11:16:00.000Z	marx2k	dn4	well, youll see a drop when AMD releases the triplecore and another drop when Intel drops the price on its quadcore
2007-09-19T11:17:00.000Z	dn4	marx2k	now I want AMD and Intel to clash in a price war on the quads haha
2007-09-19T11:21:00.000Z	dn4	marx2k	ETA in an intel-quad-core price drop?
2007-09-19T11:21:00.000Z	marx2k	dn4	shrug its not like I have the money to even be looking at prices or timelines right now :)
