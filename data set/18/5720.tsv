2009-07-24T23:55:00.000Z	dew	Trijntje	its wubi install problem. tryed to reinstall and failed. Keeps saying I dont have enough RAM. it worked like 5hrs ago. Any ideas?
2009-07-24T23:59:00.000Z	Trijntje	dew	I dont know what could cause that. Have you checked if you have enought RAM to run the version of ubuntu you are trying?
2009-07-25T00:00:00.000Z	dew	Trijntje	yea i installed it about 5hrs ago. had issues so tryed a uninstall the reinstall with wubi and it keeps failing due to 2mbs of RAM.
2009-07-25T00:01:00.000Z	Trijntje	dew	what do you mean with due to 2mbs of RAM?
2009-07-25T00:03:00.000Z	dew	Trijntje	need 256 to install(and i did it 5hrs ago) now it says when i try n install with wubi 254 of RAM. frustrating as.
2009-07-25T00:05:00.000Z	Trijntje	dew	that is very strange, when do you get the error? When you try to install ubuntu or when you try to start ubuntu?
2009-07-25T00:08:00.000Z	dew	Trijntje	hey when i tryed to install again with wubi. it loads then gives me that error. :(
2009-07-25T00:09:00.000Z	Trijntje	dew	try restarting windows, it might be confused or something
2009-07-25T00:12:00.000Z	dew	Trijntje	yea have done that twice am trying to continue with install with 254 RAM
2009-07-25T00:13:00.000Z	Trijntje	dew	when the minimal is 256, the install should fail. But i dont get why windows would think you only have 254 MB
2009-07-25T00:14:00.000Z	Trijntje	dew	You should ask again i think, i cant help you
2009-07-25T00:14:00.000Z	dew	Trijntje	zomg this sucks. Yea its downloading ubuntu-9.04-desktop-i386.iso now
2009-07-25T00:15:00.000Z	Trijntje	dew	that might be easier. windows is weird
2009-07-25T00:16:00.000Z	dew	Trijntje	lol yea i dont understand. it worked b4.?>
