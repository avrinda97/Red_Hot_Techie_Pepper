2007-04-11T09:41:00.000Z	compilerwriter	svkid	 ubuntu did just fine with my ethernet card.  Went straight out and got itself an ip from my router.
2007-04-11T09:43:00.000Z	compilerwriter	svkid	 I am connected to my "headless" kubuntu box via XDMCP on my XP box.
2007-04-11T09:46:00.000Z	compilerwriter	svkid	 The short answer is that XP and Ubuntu can generally play very well together.
2007-04-11T09:51:00.000Z	compilerwriter	svkid	I believe it does have iptables built in or at least in the repos.
2007-04-11T09:51:00.000Z	compilerwriter	svkid	were you talking about Ubuntu or ktorrent when you asked about ip filters?
2007-04-11T09:52:00.000Z	compilerwriter	svkid	the conversation has bounced a bit I got lost for a second.  give me a minute and I'll check.
2007-04-11T09:54:00.000Z	compilerwriter	svkid	ktorrent has accept and reject filters that I believe could be configured by ip.  I have never felt the need to use them though.  I gues my answer would be I think so.
2007-04-11T09:55:00.000Z	compilerwriter	svkid	bruenig and I tend to think that azureus is crap because it is a resource hog.
2007-04-11T09:56:00.000Z	compilerwriter	svkid	 I would also consider kubuntu if you like the kde desktop better than gnome.
2007-04-11T09:56:00.000Z	compilerwriter	svkid	I don't know what you are used to in Sabayan.
