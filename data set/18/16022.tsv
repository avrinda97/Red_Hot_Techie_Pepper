2005-09-25T10:11:00.000Z	regeya	auk	talking about firefox?  agreed, but I'm waiting for more plugin devs to port to 1.5. :)
2005-09-25T10:12:00.000Z	auk	regeya	yes?
2005-09-25T10:12:00.000Z	regeya	auk	sorry, looking.  I've seen it before.
2005-09-25T10:13:00.000Z	auk	regeya	cool
2005-09-25T10:14:00.000Z	regeya	auk	unless of course you happen to use backports, which isn't officially recommended and has been rumored to cause problems, though I've not yet met anyone who's had major problems with a backport.
2005-09-25T10:18:00.000Z	auk	regeya	any luck w/ that link?
2005-09-25T10:36:00.000Z	auk	regeya	ping
2005-09-25T10:36:00.000Z	regeya	auk	I forgot.  oopse.
2005-09-25T10:36:00.000Z	auk	regeya	:)
2005-09-25T10:36:00.000Z	auk	regeya	np, nvm then
2005-09-25T10:43:00.000Z	regeya	auk	can't find it, but the general idea is that you have this group of what's supposed to be stable packages, then you only release bug/security fixes during the release cycle, so as to not break anything during the stable release's lifespan.
2005-09-25T10:44:00.000Z	auk	regeya	seems liek much mroe work to work security patches in than to just update that package
2005-09-25T10:45:00.000Z	regeya	auk	my thoughts too, but I used to run distros like gentoo, so I can't fully agree ;)  true, with a decent ports-like system with good backwards deps it wouldn't be a big issue but hey, i'm getting into rough flame-worthy territory here so I'll just stop. ;)
2005-09-25T10:46:00.000Z	auk	regeya	i'm not trying for flames, i'm just trying to understand...just doesn't make sense to me
