2011-10-31T21:02:00.000Z	aconbere		hey, I'm needing to setup an xorg.conf file. I was using the directions found at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Config, it told me to run $ Xorg -configure
2011-10-31T21:02:00.000Z	aconbere		when I did this, it seems to have actually changed my xorg.conf
2011-10-31T21:02:00.000Z	aconbere		but I still don't see one existing anywhere
2011-10-31T21:02:00.000Z	aconbere		<- a little confused about what file I should be editing :P
2011-10-31T21:03:00.000Z	dr_willis	aconbere	 x uses /etc/X11/xorg.conf if it exists.
2011-10-31T21:03:00.000Z	aconbere	dr_willis	It doesn't exist
2011-10-31T21:03:00.000Z	aconbere	dr_willis	it also says it should use /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d but that doesn't exist either
2011-10-31T21:04:00.000Z	aconbere	dr_willis	I do have a /usr/share/x11/xorg.conf.d
2011-10-31T21:04:00.000Z	dr_willis	aconbere	 what are you trying to acomplish exactly?
2011-10-31T21:04:00.000Z	aconbere	dr_willis	I'm trying to setup a multiheaded monitor setup without gnome
2011-10-31T21:04:00.000Z	dr_willis	aconbere	 whats the video chipset?
2011-10-31T21:05:00.000Z	aconbere	dr_willis	one of the silly intel ones, I have it working in xrandr and previously through gnome
2011-10-31T21:05:00.000Z	dr_willis	aconbere	 Hmm. all i ever had to do for my intel laptops was run that monitors tool. Im not even sure it altered xorg.conf
2011-10-31T21:05:00.000Z	aconbere	dr_willis	I assume the "monitors" tool is the gnome one right?
2011-10-31T21:06:00.000Z	dr_willis	aconbere	 i imagine it exists on xubuntu, lubuntu, and kubuntu also.
2011-10-31T21:06:00.000Z	dr_willis	aconbere	 in one form or another.,
2011-10-31T21:06:00.000Z	aconbere	dr_willis	I'm pretty sure that manipulates xrandr... That works fine, I would just have to make sure I call it before I start xmonad :P
2011-10-31T21:09:00.000Z	aconbere	dr_willis	heh, hmmm no dice (also moved to a proper virtual terminal so I can stop X and keep this open)
