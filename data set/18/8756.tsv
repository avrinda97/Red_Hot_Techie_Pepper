2007-07-14T15:06:00.000Z	banlieue		it is?
2007-07-14T15:06:00.000Z	banlieue		didnt know that
2007-07-14T15:06:00.000Z	banlieue		explains it :)
2007-07-14T15:07:00.000Z	banlieue		never realised as much as the desktop effects dont work for me anyway (ati+3d acceleration=hell)
2007-07-14T15:07:00.000Z	ShackJack	banlieue	You can run compiz with XGL...
2007-07-14T15:08:00.000Z	ShackJack	banlieue	You just need to create an XGL session, then you should be able to use Compiz..
2007-07-14T15:08:00.000Z	ShackJack	banlieue	But yeah, ATI does kind of bite it...
2007-07-29T16:32:00.000Z	ShackJack	banlieue	Safe to remove earlier kernels if new ones work....
2007-07-29T16:34:00.000Z	ShackJack	banlieue	Different proggies have different dependecies sometimes :)
2007-07-29T16:34:00.000Z	banlieue	ShackJack	you just saved me from the hassle of having to reinstall all this :]  ty
2007-07-29T16:35:00.000Z	ShackJack	banlieue	Every use deborphan - it's pretty cool :)
2007-07-29T16:36:00.000Z	banlieue	ShackJack	i have not, but i'm about to apt-get it :] 
2007-07-29T16:36:00.000Z	ShackJack	banlieue	Be careful with it... it has a gui front end - too...
2007-07-29T16:42:00.000Z	banlieue	ShackJack	libs given by deborphan should generally be safe to remove, right? :)
2007-07-29T16:43:00.000Z	ShackJack	banlieue	Yes
2007-07-29T16:43:00.000Z	ShackJack	banlieue	But watch it on the other stuff... as some packages are "stand-alone' and deb orphan don't get that :)
2007-07-29T16:44:00.000Z	ShackJack	banlieue	And it will never get the old kernels as they aren't orphans :)
2007-07-29T16:47:00.000Z	banlieue	ShackJack	phew, that saved me a whopping 254KB of disk space, not taking into account deborphan's install size ;)
