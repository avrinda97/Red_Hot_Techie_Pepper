2007-09-20T13:34:00.000Z	calpolyt		hey, im having trouble getting WPA working. ive tried alot of different things and none of em seemed to work. can anyone help me out with this?
2007-09-20T13:36:00.000Z	calpolyt		i dont know exactly, its some in-built pos on my laptop. im new to linux in general so im not familiar with finding out my specs. whats the linux equivalent of dxdiag?
2007-09-20T13:37:00.000Z	calpolyt		00:09.0 Network controller: RaLink RT2500 802.11g Cardbus/mini-PCI (rev 01)
2007-09-20T13:38:00.000Z	calpolyt		i do have it
2007-09-20T13:39:00.000Z	calpolyt		yes
2007-09-20T13:39:00.000Z	calpolyt		i can connect just fine to my WEP home network
2007-09-20T13:39:00.000Z	calpolyt		but i need WPA to connect to the LEAP network at my campus
2007-09-20T13:41:00.000Z	tico	calpolyt	try network-manager
2007-09-20T13:41:00.000Z	calpolyt		i tried to; there's a guest network on campus as well and i couldnt connect to it either.
2007-09-20T13:42:00.000Z	calpolyt		right
2007-09-20T13:42:00.000Z	calpolyt	tico	 i already have network-manager
2007-09-20T13:42:00.000Z	calpolyt		it wont give me WPA options. only WEP
2007-09-20T13:42:00.000Z	calpolyt		im guessing it needs to be configured somehow
2007-09-20T13:43:00.000Z	calpolyt		and i dont know where or how to do that exactly
2007-09-20T13:43:00.000Z	calpolyt		the GUI isnt very exhaustive
2007-09-20T13:44:00.000Z	calpolyt		well, i'll need WEP for my home connection
2007-09-20T13:45:00.000Z	tico	calpolyt	which ubuntu do u have
