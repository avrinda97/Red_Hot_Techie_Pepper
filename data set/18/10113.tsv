2007-01-12T14:28:00.000Z	Maric	audel1	mostly by looking at the cache in the browser, after that you might try using the parenting tools availiable on the web
2007-01-12T14:29:00.000Z	Maric	audel1	but mostly try to understand that we try to respect privacy and access to information (even porn) here
2007-01-12T14:30:00.000Z	audel1	Maric	what?
2007-01-12T14:32:00.000Z	audel1	Maric	I know that, but I can't understand why you are telling me that? What do you mean?
2007-01-12T14:32:00.000Z	Maric	audel1	aiding others to spy on/limit others use of their computer is antithetical to our core philosophy, freedom accepts no limits and information wants to be free
2007-01-12T14:33:00.000Z	audel1	Maric	Who's trying to limit someone elses use on computers?
2007-01-12T14:34:00.000Z	Maric	audel1	was not your question as to how one could findout about your husbands activities?
2007-01-12T14:34:00.000Z	audel1	Maric	No It wasn't
