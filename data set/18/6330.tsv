2008-05-25T15:44:00.000Z	anirudh0	robg_	i think he means full screen video of the same quality
2008-05-25T15:44:00.000Z	anirudh0	robg_	then the user's cpu has to do the work...not the server
2008-05-25T15:45:00.000Z	robg_	anirudh0	the user's CPU is not a problem. It is the bandwidth consumption.
2008-05-25T15:46:00.000Z	anirudh0	robg_	well..if the video is of the same quality, then the same amount of data must be sent...so why more B/W
2008-05-25T16:14:00.000Z	anirudh0	robg_	wow..what if a cd gets scratches?
2008-05-25T16:14:00.000Z	robg_	anirudh0	always make 3 copies.
2008-05-25T22:23:00.000Z	robg_	anirudh0	there is far too much experimentation on this channel. We should be aiming for solid production machines not monsters of Frankenstein.
2008-05-25T22:24:00.000Z	anirudh0	robg_	as is clear from bjwebb's response to my warning :)
2008-05-27T21:47:00.000Z	anirudh0	robg_	what do you mean by "operates outside linux"
2008-05-27T22:00:00.000Z	anirudh0	robg_	does'nt it have exactly the same packages on it?
2008-05-27T22:01:00.000Z	anirudh0	robg_	in what sense...do you mean the packages in alternate have security updates or something?
2008-05-27T22:01:00.000Z	anirudh0	robg_	i think you are a little sleepy :)
2008-05-27T22:02:00.000Z	robg_	anirudh0	Do not forget that Ubuntu Desktop is a transitional technology for dual-boot.
2008-05-27T22:03:00.000Z	anirudh0	robg_	i must correct my earlier statement..you are very sleepy or a little high :)
2008-05-27T22:04:00.000Z	robg_	anirudh0	perhaps we are talking about different OSes.
2008-05-28T17:30:00.000Z	robg_	anirudh0	I am getting much higher default resolutions and windows are not walking of my screen.
2008-05-28T17:31:00.000Z	anirudh0	robg_	out of respect for you, i will not answer that question
2008-05-28T17:32:00.000Z	robg_	anirudh0	AERO on Vista is a disaster.
