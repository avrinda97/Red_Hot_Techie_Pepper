2010-07-16T12:51:00.000Z	aaaoooaaa		hi guys, I have an instructional book that has an audio cd accompanying it; I tried to make a backup using brasero and it spit out a .toc + bin(i think) file . Just to confirm, i tried burning the resulting .toc unto an empty cd, using brasero, but upon reinsertion it isnt being recognized. What should I do?
2010-07-16T12:53:00.000Z	DasEi	aaaoooaaa	I use k3b or dd for imaging cd's
2010-07-16T12:55:00.000Z	aaaoooaaa	DasEi	alright I think I found a tutorial on how to burn using dd
2010-07-16T12:55:00.000Z	DasEi	aaaoooaaa	by dd you can just dd if=dev/sr0 of=any.iso
2010-07-16T12:57:00.000Z	aaaoooaaa	DasEi	why sr0 and not say cdrom0 ?
2010-07-16T12:57:00.000Z	DasEi	aaaoooaaa	'cause dd does a block/sectorwise copy on a device
2010-07-16T13:27:00.000Z	aaaoooaaa	DasEi	hey I tried the dd thing but its giving me an error
2010-07-16T13:28:00.000Z	DasEi	aaaoooaaa	read error on the cd ?
2010-07-16T13:28:00.000Z	aaaoooaaa	DasEi	dd: opening `dev/sr0': No such file or directory
2010-07-16T13:29:00.000Z	DasEi	aaaoooaaa	check mount for the correct devicename
2010-07-16T13:30:00.000Z	DasEi	aaaoooaaa	and would be /dev/sr0
2010-07-16T13:31:00.000Z	aaaoooaaa	DasEi	what type of filesystem should it be? I dont think IM seeing anything resembling an Audio cd ... unless instructional audio cd have some special filtype ... http://pastebin.com/ZDZChApx
2010-07-16T13:33:00.000Z	DasEi	aaaoooaaa	seems like cd isn't mounted right know, click under places and repeat mount-command
2010-07-16T13:35:00.000Z	aaaoooaaa	DasEi	alright remounted, and just to be sure, played one of the audio files in the cd. http://pastebin.com/xkDViXAg
2010-07-16T13:36:00.000Z	aaaoooaaa	DasEi	the files have little "x"'s on their icons...might this be the issue?
2010-07-16T13:36:00.000Z	aaaoooaaa	DasEi	on the wave files
2010-07-16T13:39:00.000Z	aaaoooaaa	DasEi	yeah?no?maybe?
