2007-02-26T14:10:00.000Z	dasrot		is there anyway to share an external harddrive over the network that is attatched to an winxp machine?
2007-02-26T14:11:00.000Z	h1st0	dasrot	yes
2007-02-26T14:11:00.000Z	h1st0	dasrot	share the drive in windows then access it in linux as that what you trying to do?
2007-02-26T14:11:00.000Z	h1st0	dasrot	well first share hte drive in windows.  Just like you normally would.  Then to access it in linux you need to enable samba.
2007-02-26T14:14:00.000Z	h1st0	dasrot	yeah you could even have a ext3 partition shared via samba and should be able to write to it with windows xp.
2007-02-26T14:15:00.000Z	h1st0	dasrot	you don't need to do that.
2007-02-26T14:15:00.000Z	h1st0	dasrot	just create he ext3 partition and then share it with samba windows should be able to write with it just like a network drive.
2007-02-26T14:16:00.000Z	h1st0	dasrot	yeah here let me explain my setup.
2007-02-26T14:17:00.000Z	h1st0	dasrot	I have a server with /home/public directory that I made.  Then I share the /home/public directory to everyone with samba.  Any one on my network can write and read to that directory.
2007-02-26T14:17:00.000Z	h1st0	dasrot	samba is simple here let me get you a link
2007-02-26T14:19:00.000Z	h1st0	dasrot	install samba and smbfs then follow these instructions to let everyone read/write on the network http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Edgy#How_to_share_public_folders_with_read.2Fwrite_permissions_.28Authentication.3DNo.29
2007-02-26T14:19:00.000Z	h1st0	dasrot	well it will in some instances depends on your setup
2007-02-26T14:22:00.000Z	h1st0	dasrot	what type of partition is it?
2007-02-26T14:23:00.000Z	h1st0	dasrot	yeah you can't write to a partition you mounted you have to share it as a network resource follow the instructions I sent you.
2007-02-26T14:24:00.000Z	h1st0	dasrot	yeah if you woul dlisten but oh well.
2007-02-26T14:24:00.000Z	h1st0	dasrot	you can easily accomplish what you wanted to do.  Have one machine (linux) download to lets say /home/share and then share that folder over the network so that the XP machine can read and write it.
2007-02-26T14:25:00.000Z	h1st0	dasrot	^^^^^^^
2007-02-26T14:26:00.000Z	h1st0	dasrot	If you are daul booting that is different then you would want a fat32 partition so that both operating systems could read and write.
