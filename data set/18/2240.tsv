2011-07-03T16:14:00.000Z	dagon666		what should I use to be able to automount usb disks in ubuntu server ?
2011-07-03T16:15:00.000Z	histo	dagon666	are you running a Desktop Environment on the server or just command line?
2011-07-03T16:15:00.000Z	dagon666	histo	no X's
2011-07-03T16:17:00.000Z	histo	dagon666	what version of ubuntu?
2011-07-03T16:17:00.000Z	dagon666	histo	does it matter ? I can compile from sources if needed
2011-07-03T16:18:00.000Z	histo	dagon666	well they stopped auto mounting in server with their versions of hal/dbus but I believe you can install the usbmount package and all should be happy.
2011-07-03T16:19:00.000Z	histo	dagon666	atleast that's supposed to be the point of that package to add that functionality back to the server edition.
2011-07-03T16:19:00.000Z	dagon666	histo	I already tried that - there are major problems with providing access to all users
2011-07-03T16:20:00.000Z	histo	dagon666	well maybe change the options
2011-07-03T16:20:00.000Z	histo	dagon666	i'm assuming that package just reconfigures dbus.
2011-07-03T16:20:00.000Z	histo	dagon666	or udev
2011-07-03T16:21:00.000Z	dagon666	histo	I already played around with umask,gid,user options for mount, the problem was that it resets the permissions on the mountpoint back to root
2011-07-03T16:21:00.000Z	histo	dagon666	check under /etc/udev/rules.d/
2011-07-03T16:22:00.000Z	dagon666	histo	yeah, I'll play around
2011-07-03T16:23:00.000Z	histo	dagon666	you should be able to configure the rule to whatever options you want.
2011-07-03T16:24:00.000Z	histo	dagon666	i'm not sure how the ubuntu-devs have smashed those files though. Atleast I can in arch. I'll give you a link to their wiki for some direction. The exact filename for the .rules won't be the same but will give you some guidance.
2011-07-03T16:24:00.000Z	histo	dagon666	https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Udev#Auto_mounting_USB_devices
2011-07-03T16:24:00.000Z	dagon666	histo	ok, thanks
