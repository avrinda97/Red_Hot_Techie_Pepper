2008-04-06T12:58:00.000Z	Jester009	stefg	thanks i'll try that
2008-04-06T12:55:00.000Z	Jester009	stefg	I'm still quite lost even after looking at those sites. What can I do to get past this point?
2008-04-06T12:56:00.000Z	stefg	Jester009	is there a printer connected to the box?
2008-04-06T12:56:00.000Z	Jester009	stefg	nope
2008-04-06T12:57:00.000Z	stefg	Jester009	then you don't need cups. Disable it in System-Admin-startup services
2008-04-06T12:58:00.000Z	stefg	Jester009	and check your bios for odd settings for the parallel port, if there is one
2008-04-06T13:06:00.000Z	stefg	Jester009	in the startup services control applet. it's in system-administration menu. uncheck the cupsys item
2008-04-06T13:06:00.000Z	Jester009	stefg	i have no idea where that is
2008-04-06T13:06:00.000Z	stefg	Jester009	you're using gnome, aren't you?
2008-04-06T13:07:00.000Z	Jester009	stefg	i actually have xp installed on this pc and i just booted it with xubuntu cd
2008-04-06T13:08:00.000Z	stefg	Jester009	if you are running from Live CD switching it off doesn't make sense... the setting will be lost anyway
2008-04-06T13:10:00.000Z	Jester009	stefg	I'm just trying to get xubuntu on this machine. There is nothing on it that I don't have backed up so this laptop is just for learning. How else can I get this working?
2008-04-06T13:10:00.000Z	stefg	Jester009	so the Live CD doesn't even boot?
2008-04-06T13:11:00.000Z	Jester009	stefg	it freezes at starting common unix printing cupsd
2008-04-06T13:11:00.000Z	stefg	Jester009	ah, now i understand. Can be a irq or acpi problem. try some bootoptions
2008-04-06T13:12:00.000Z	stefg	Jester009	my guess is that you'll need something along the lines of irqpoll or fixirq, or acpi=off
2008-04-06T13:12:00.000Z	Jester009	stefg	thanks. I think the reason its giving me problems is my BIOs dont meet the cutoff date by one year.
2008-04-06T13:12:00.000Z	stefg	Jester009	update it?
