2011-08-17T08:57:00.000Z	greg3000		hiya friends, I just upgraded my ubuntu box to the latest distro and now the thing just reboots after passing the grub menu.  Anyone else experiencing this?
2011-08-17T08:58:00.000Z	urlin2u	greg3000	maverick to natty upgrade?
2011-08-17T08:58:00.000Z	greg3000	urlin2u	yes, natty, it gave me the new 2.6.38-10 kernel
2011-08-17T09:00:00.000Z	urlin2u	greg3000	boot a ubuntu cd, and run the all the commands together in a terminal and paste bin the RESULTS.txt that will be in home. http://paste.ubuntu.com/667640/
2011-08-17T09:00:00.000Z	greg3000	urlin2u	ok I will check it out
2011-08-17T09:01:00.000Z	urlin2u	greg3000	theadmin may be correct did you get a clean upgrade?
2011-08-17T09:03:00.000Z	greg3000	urlin2u	this was a minimal 10.10 install running only command line, and so I upgraded from the command line.  Everything seemed to work fine, just after rebooting the screen goes off shortly after it passes the grub menu
2011-08-17T09:04:00.000Z	urlin2u	greg3000	okay you might just follow this guide, 3 methods here a load from a Natty only cd or use the third chroot if another ubuntu cd. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2#Copy%20LiveCD%20Files
2011-08-17T09:05:00.000Z	greg3000	urlin2u	ok thanks again
2011-08-17T09:05:00.000Z	urlin2u	greg3000	if your running headless you could follow this I assume. ;-)
2011-08-17T09:06:00.000Z	greg3000	urlin2u	aye it's a headless box
2011-08-17T09:06:00.000Z	urlin2u	greg3000	grub2 is the link I assume here as well.
2011-08-17T09:07:00.000Z	greg3000	urlin2u	I think it is grub2, gonna go start hacking away.  thanks - will report back
2011-08-17T09:07:00.000Z	urlin2u	greg3000	cool if you had a upgrade that needs restarting there are a couple of commands  as well.
2011-08-17T13:07:00.000Z	urlin2u	greg3000	this may help not sure. http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/natty/man1/shelldap.1p.html
2011-08-17T13:08:00.000Z	greg3000	urlin2u	thanks m8
2011-08-17T13:08:00.000Z	urlin2u	greg3000	glad to see your up and running.
