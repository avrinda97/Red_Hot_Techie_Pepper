2011-05-13T17:36:00.000Z	SuperLag		how do you get a startup script to work? I've tried things I've read in the forums. Creating a +x script in /etc/init.d/ and doing update-rc.d foo defaults. Tried adding something to /etc/rc.local. Tried using the "Startup Applications" option in the Prefs menu. *None* of them work. UGH. :/
2011-05-13T17:38:00.000Z	rileyp	SuperLag	 add it to /etc/rc.local
2011-05-13T17:38:00.000Z	rileyp	SuperLag	 if it dont work try running it from a terminal first if you cant run it from a terminal it dont work
2011-05-13T17:39:00.000Z	SuperLag	rileyp	it works when I run it directly from the terminal, and like I said... already tried adding it to /etc/rc.local - that didn't work either.
2011-05-13T17:39:00.000Z	rileyp	SuperLag	 is it after a resum or a cold boot?
2011-05-13T17:39:00.000Z	SuperLag	rileyp	I'm just trying to start hostapd and have it read the config file for hostapd.
2011-05-13T17:39:00.000Z	rileyp		rc.local wont work after a resume
2011-05-13T17:40:00.000Z	SuperLag	rileyp	cold boot
2011-05-13T17:40:00.000Z	rileyp		only after a cold boot
2011-05-13T17:41:00.000Z	rileyp		put the code direct into /etc/rc.local and it will do whatever you ask it too provided it has permission to and the file is executible
2011-05-13T17:43:00.000Z	SuperLag	rileyp	should what I put in /etc/rc.local be a reference to a +x script with the commands I want run in that script? or should I be putting the commands I want run right in /etc/rc.local?
2011-05-13T17:43:00.000Z	SuperLag	rileyp	because all I'm doing is "hostapd /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf"
2011-05-13T17:43:00.000Z	SuperLag	rileyp	that's it.
2011-05-13T17:43:00.000Z	SuperLag	rileyp	and that's exactly what's in rc.local, right now
2011-05-13T17:46:00.000Z	rileyp	SuperLag	 you can do either eg  you could put in firefox &  to start firefox or a series of command a pserate line for each command
2011-05-13T17:46:00.000Z	rileyp	SuperLag	 thats  *seperate sorry
2011-05-13T17:54:00.000Z	SuperLag	rileyp	llutz_: thanks guys
2011-05-13T17:54:00.000Z	SuperLag	rileyp	llutz_: it was that I wasn't giving full path to the hostapd binary
