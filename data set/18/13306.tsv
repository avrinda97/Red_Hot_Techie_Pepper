2006-05-05T11:52:00.000Z	romulo		Auska,how many do you own?
2006-05-05T11:52:00.000Z	romulo		Auska,it was not for you, it was for crunchyfish
2006-05-05T11:54:00.000Z	romulo		Auska,nvidia not working?
2006-05-05T11:55:00.000Z	romulo		anyone here knows if the solution for "no inittab file found" message does have a good solution and if just replace the /etc/inittab works?
2006-05-05T11:55:00.000Z	romulo		Auska,install xorg-driver-nvidia i believe
2006-05-05T11:55:00.000Z	romulo		and it should be all fine
2006-05-05T11:56:00.000Z	romulo		so it just seems that
2006-05-05T11:56:00.000Z	dli	romulo	that's very bad :( check whether /etc/inittab is really missing
2006-05-05T11:57:00.000Z	romulo	dli	i think fsck removed it
2006-05-05T11:57:00.000Z	dli	romulo	you can boot livecd, run apt-get with chroot :)
2006-05-05T11:58:00.000Z	romulo	dli	yep
2006-05-05T11:58:00.000Z	romulo	dli	will do
2006-05-05T11:58:00.000Z	dli	romulo	I think the package is init-scripts
2006-05-05T12:03:00.000Z	dli	romulo	does ubuntu have the package, sys-apps/sysvinit ?
2006-05-05T12:04:00.000Z	dli	romulo	you found the package?
2006-05-05T12:04:00.000Z	romulo	dli	wich one?
2006-05-05T12:04:00.000Z	dli	romulo	sysvinit
