2010-09-01T22:29:00.000Z	ectospasm	zachary	./a.out
2010-09-01T22:26:00.000Z	ectospasm	zachary	try "g++ -o file file.cpp"
2010-09-01T22:27:00.000Z	zachary	ectospasm	i tried it but nothing ran
2010-09-01T22:27:00.000Z	ectospasm	zachary	it won't have any output if it succeeds.
2010-09-01T22:28:00.000Z	zachary	ectospasm	so if i have a program that does cout >>"hello"; where will it show?
2010-09-01T22:28:00.000Z	ectospasm	zachary	it will show in the linux shell (standard output), but you have to run the command.  Like "./file"
2010-09-01T22:29:00.000Z	zachary	ectospasm	i dont even see a .out file in the directory
2010-09-01T22:30:00.000Z	ectospasm	zachary	not a .out, a.out
2010-09-01T22:30:00.000Z	zachary	ectospasm	when i run ./a.out nothing happens
2010-09-01T22:31:00.000Z	ectospasm	zachary	your code is wrong.  Try cout << "Hello, World!\n";
2010-09-01T22:31:00.000Z	zachary	ectospasm	so when it complies it wont give me any errors?
2010-09-01T22:32:00.000Z	ectospasm	zachary	it gives you errors the way you have it now?
2010-09-01T22:33:00.000Z	zachary	ectospasm	does dev++ have the compiler already in it so i just have to hit build/run and it does it for me?
2010-09-01T22:33:00.000Z	ectospasm	zachary	I don't know what dev++ is
2010-09-01T22:33:00.000Z	zachary	ectospasm	IDE
2010-09-01T22:34:00.000Z	ectospasm	zachary	there are a BAZILLION IDEs, most have a compile/link/run step.  Consult your class notes or dev++ documentation
