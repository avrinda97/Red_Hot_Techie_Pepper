2009-02-03T07:52:00.000Z	Tyrath	pyromaniaman	it won't let me
2009-02-03T07:48:00.000Z	pyromaniaman	Tyrath	yeah, and make sure that the layer is the size of the canvas
2009-02-03T07:51:00.000Z	Tyrath	pyromaniaman	that worked. thanks. now i'm wondering what A4 size is
2009-02-03T07:51:00.000Z	Tyrath	pyromaniaman	like in pixels that is
2009-02-03T07:51:00.000Z	pyromaniaman	Tyrath	you can specify that in new image size
2009-02-03T07:52:00.000Z	pyromaniaman	Tyrath	let me see, hang on
2009-02-03T07:53:00.000Z	pyromaniaman	Tyrath	2480x3508@300ppi
2009-02-03T07:56:00.000Z	Tyrath	pyromaniaman	it seems to just be blowing it up to huge proportions
2009-02-03T07:56:00.000Z	pyromaniaman	Tyrath	that's A4.
2009-02-03T07:57:00.000Z	pyromaniaman	Tyrath	at printing size, anyway
2009-02-03T07:57:00.000Z	Tyrath	pyromaniaman	could i try to change print size to get it to go A4?
2009-02-03T08:06:00.000Z	Tyrath	pyromaniaman	ok i've just realised it doesn't seem to matter what size i make the canvas it still prints at the same size
2009-02-03T08:07:00.000Z	Tyrath	pyromaniaman	anyway around this?
2009-02-03T08:07:00.000Z	pyromaniaman	Tyrath	probably the printer
2009-02-03T08:07:00.000Z	Tyrath	pyromaniaman	but the borders seem to be different for word docs and images
2009-02-03T08:15:00.000Z	Tyrath	pyromaniaman	is there any way to set default print settings?
2009-02-03T08:15:00.000Z	pyromaniaman	Tyrath	i don't know, sorry
2009-02-03T08:17:00.000Z	Tyrath	pyromaniaman	no worries. thanks anyhow
