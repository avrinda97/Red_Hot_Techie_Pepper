2006-07-10T13:37:00.000Z	mitrovarr		anyone know how to force X to start in a specific resolution and no other?
2006-07-10T13:37:00.000Z	unstablesob	mitrovarr	edit your xorg.conf
2006-07-10T13:38:00.000Z	mitrovarr	unstablesob	 I have been, but it refuses to start in the only resolution I gave it in screens.
2006-07-10T13:38:00.000Z	mitrovarr	unstablesob	 It drops to a slightly lower resolution instead
2006-07-10T13:39:00.000Z	unstablesob	mitrovarr	you might need to add HorizSync and VertRefresh for your monitor then
2006-07-10T13:39:00.000Z	mitrovarr	unstablesob	 It's a laptop screen.  I can't even begin to guess what numbers to use.
2006-07-10T13:39:00.000Z	mitrovarr	unstablesob	 I think it does 1024x768x70hz
2006-07-10T13:40:00.000Z	unstablesob	mitrovarr	you can get the numbers from the INF file used by Windows as well
2006-07-10T13:40:00.000Z	mitrovarr	unstablesob	 know where it would be stored in 98?  Windows has been formatted off, but everything was backed up.
2006-07-10T13:42:00.000Z	unstablesob	mitrovarr	can you get the monitor driver from the manufactuers website?
2006-07-10T13:42:00.000Z	mitrovarr	unstablesob	 Actually, I tracked down the inf file and looked at it.  It doesn't contain any information of that sort.
2006-07-10T13:43:00.000Z	mitrovarr	unstablesob	 I'm not sure I need the exact accurate horiz and vert.  Do you know just typical values for a 1024x768 monitor?
2006-07-10T13:43:00.000Z	unstablesob	mitrovarr	i dont' i always use the exact numbers for my displays
2006-07-10T13:44:00.000Z	mitrovarr		ok.  I'll go try to find the real ones.
2006-07-10T13:44:00.000Z	unstablesob	mitrovarr	can you pastebin the file at http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/ ?
2006-07-10T13:45:00.000Z	mitrovarr	unstablesob	 The inf file?  I can read it, it doesn't contain any useful information.
2006-07-10T13:47:00.000Z	unstablesob	mitrovarr	are you by chance using nvidia drivers?
2006-07-10T13:48:00.000Z	mitrovarr	unstablesob	 Hah!  I wish.  This POS has a virge.
