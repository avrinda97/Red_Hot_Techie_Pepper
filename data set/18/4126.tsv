2009-11-12T22:11:00.000Z	maria_		does Karmic crawl on 900Mhz?  anyone else creeping along?
2009-11-12T22:12:00.000Z	Trizicus	maria_	I would presume it matters on how much desktop effects you have activated

2009-11-12T22:14:00.000Z	Trizicus	maria_	Usually your cpu is set to ondemand use. Install rcconf, run rcconf, and then uncheck ondemand
2009-11-12T22:15:00.000Z	Trizicus	maria_	Also some daemons might be useless for you such as the bluetooth one (if you dont have bluetooth)
2009-11-12T22:15:00.000Z	Trizicus	maria_	Install xfce desktop
2009-11-12T22:20:00.000Z	Trizicus	maria_	I would disable it because off by default
2009-11-12T22:20:00.000Z	Trizicus	maria_	it is off*
2009-11-12T22:21:00.000Z	Trizicus	maria_	All default installs of ubuntu have it's settings off by default (however it is on in daemons which makes no sense)
2009-11-12T22:22:00.000Z	Trizicus	maria_	sudo update-rc.d laptop-mode disable
2009-11-12T22:25:00.000Z	Trizicus	maria_	Is your speed faster than 1.2mbps?
2009-11-12T22:26:00.000Z	Trizicus	maria_	Wired and wireless speeds differ
2009-11-12T22:27:00.000Z	Trizicus	maria_	For example max speed wired can be 2000gbps+ whereas wifi is max of 54mbps (27 if you're lucky)
2009-11-12T22:28:00.000Z	Trizicus	maria_	Make sure your cpu settings are on ondemand mode and it'll most likely subside
2009-11-12T22:28:00.000Z	Trizicus	maria_	arent on*
