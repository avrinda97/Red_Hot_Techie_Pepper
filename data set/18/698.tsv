2011-10-20T23:53:00.000Z	Belgicano		Hi all, anyone has an idea as why my FF7 sometimes starts eating one core to a 100% for a while then drops back? I cannot link it to a specific action or event...

2011-10-20T23:54:00.000Z	avn-matt	Belgicano	have you tried opera?
2011-10-20T23:55:00.000Z	Belgicano	avn-matt	i like FF, and it's just been annoying me for a little while so i'll try to stay with it...
2011-10-20T23:56:00.000Z	avn-matt	Belgicano	i have been doing a start private broswer in firefox when i am going to idle
2011-10-20T23:57:00.000Z	Belgicano	avn-matt	the problem is not the memory, the cpu goes crazy on one core then goes quiet agzin...
2011-10-21T00:01:00.000Z	avn-matt	Belgicano	see if there are any build args for hyper threading support for ff...  just a guess
2011-10-21T00:03:00.000Z	Belgicano	avn-matt	I hope it doesnt start eating my quadcores together once i enable the threading...
2011-10-21T00:04:00.000Z	avn-matt	Belgicano	so i was right? niiiice.
2011-10-21T00:06:00.000Z	Belgicano	avn-matt	soy for being a joy-breaker but... not yet, I'm still looking for it...
2011-10-21T00:06:00.000Z	avn-matt	Belgicano	I'd be more worried about it stressing at 100% with a program that is notorious for memory hogging
2011-10-21T00:09:00.000Z	Belgicano	avn-matt	luckily it's not, what "worries" me is that i've yet to hear about someone else having that problem...
2011-10-21T00:10:00.000Z	avn-matt	Belgicano	from ver 9 - If you are running a pentium machine with hyper-threading, turn the hyper-threading off in the machine's bios. Having had the same problem you are reporting on two machines, this has fixed the firefox issues on both of them.
2011-10-21T00:11:00.000Z	Belgicano	avn-matt	so we're at "hardware" has to adapt to "software", not good...
2011-10-21T00:12:00.000Z	avn-matt	Belgicano	heh, opera sounding better yet? do a /proc/cpuinfo for me
2011-10-21T00:14:00.000Z	Belgicano	avn-matt	is "Intel(R) Core(TM) i5 CPU       M 460  @ 2.53GHz" enough or do you need the whole thing?
