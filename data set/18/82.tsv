2012-09-30T10:29:00.000Z	Guest70518		What could be the reason that my new Logitech K750 wireless keyboard does not work with the pre-boot encryption login password?
2012-09-30T10:30:00.000Z	chris92	Guest70518	i guess the "wireless" is the problem
2012-09-30T10:31:00.000Z	chris92	Guest70518	how does it connect to the pc, bluetooth?
