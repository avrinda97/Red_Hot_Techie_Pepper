2010-08-09T06:25:00.000Z	kc8pxy		how do i add a sshfs mount to my fstab w/o puting credentials in the fstab?
2010-08-09T06:25:00.000Z	guampa	kc8pxy	you have to use keys to authenticate
2010-08-09T06:27:00.000Z	kc8pxy	guampa	 MUST use keys? i can;t do something like a credentials file like cifs?
2010-08-09T06:28:00.000Z	kc8pxy	guampa	that's fine if i need to, but where does mount need the keys to be??  i know the server I'm mounting from needs the keys in the auth keys.
2010-08-09T06:29:00.000Z	guampa	kc8pxy	well the private key is a credential file...and yes, if you don't want to put passwords in fstab you'll have to use another method, i mentioned keys because it's the other popular mehod
2010-08-09T06:32:00.000Z	guampa	kc8pxy	you cahn specify the priv keyfile with -o IdentityFile="pathtokeyfile"
2010-08-09T06:34:00.000Z	guampa	kc8pxy	you can script  the connection / mount process
2010-08-09T06:34:00.000Z	kc8pxy	guampa	 thx.
2010-08-09T06:34:00.000Z	kc8pxy	guampa	 that's what i hit on
2010-08-09T06:34:00.000Z	guampa	kc8pxy	or use /etc/network/interfaces and post-up
2010-08-09T06:35:00.000Z	kc8pxy	guampa	 but to make sure it lands after the openvpn,  i need to write an init script (something i've still avoided over 10 years of linux use), and place it after the openvpn connection on which the ssh resides that i want to mount.
2010-08-09T06:35:00.000Z	kc8pxy	guampa	 or else write it into my bashrc.
2010-08-09T06:36:00.000Z	kc8pxy	guampa	 neither ogf those is nearly as elegant as i wish i could do.
2010-08-09T06:37:00.000Z	guampa	kc8pxy	/etc/rc.local is perfect for that. the "elegant" way would be to use /etc/network/interfaces and post-up, but "elegant" can be whatever you use, i use rc.local extensively for my own startup scripts
2010-08-09T06:40:00.000Z	kc8pxy	guampa	m_tadeu: mebbe yuo guys can guide me to a better solution. i need to access my phprojekt via sftp or sshfs, I'm trying to access it with PDT for eclipse.  i have a zend project.
2010-08-09T06:42:00.000Z	guampa	kc8pxy	not sure what you mean by "better", you want to make sure the mount is made after the vpn is up?
2010-08-09T06:44:00.000Z	kc8pxy	guampa	 i guess my issue is,  i have gnome up,   and i can sftp into the project dir.. but eclipse can't find it.  so i thought if i mounted the sftp as sshfs, that would work,  and it seems far too complicated to be my first choice.
2010-08-09T06:44:00.000Z	guampa	kc8pxy	if so add "noauto" in the fstab line and make it mount after the vpn goes up, you can script the vpn connection or use /etc/network/interfaces, i must say i've never used the latter for vpns, but it'll probablly work
