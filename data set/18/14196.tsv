2005-09-02T13:59:00.000Z	cemc		i dont know what installs a .deb yet :))
2005-09-02T13:59:00.000Z	cemc		hehe
2005-09-02T14:00:00.000Z	cemc		so, i can install, remove packages with dpkg,
2005-09-02T14:00:00.000Z	cemc		and it will complain if a package needs another one
2005-09-02T14:01:00.000Z	cemc		it won't install it, it will merely complain, right?
2005-09-02T14:01:00.000Z	cemc		then if i want to install package X, which depends on package Y,
2005-09-02T14:01:00.000Z	cemc		i have to download it myself,
2005-09-02T14:01:00.000Z	cemc		then i can install them both,
2005-09-02T14:01:00.000Z	cemc		at the same time
2005-09-02T14:01:00.000Z	cemc		right ?
2005-09-02T14:02:00.000Z	topyli	cemc	normally you use apt-get and forget about dependencies
2005-09-02T14:02:00.000Z	cemc		so.. apt = yum
2005-09-02T14:02:00.000Z	topyli		something like that
2005-09-02T14:03:00.000Z	cemc		so i can do without any apt, and nautilus and stuff, just with dpkg, if i handle the dependencies manually
2005-09-02T14:03:00.000Z	topyli	cemc	and synaptic is like the Foo Software Management Center that distros tend to have too
2005-09-02T14:04:00.000Z	topyli	cemc	sure, but nobody does that
2005-09-02T14:04:00.000Z	cemc	topyli	yeah, well... in fedora i'm using mainly rpm only... and handle the dependencies manually
2005-09-02T14:04:00.000Z	cemc	topyli	i thought so ;)
