2008-11-10T17:52:00.000Z	lilleman		What is the dd process in the newest install of Ubuntu? It's eating lots (several %) of my system resources...
2008-11-10T17:53:00.000Z	lilleman		yup
2008-11-10T17:53:00.000Z	lilleman		exactly
2008-11-10T17:53:00.000Z	lilleman		what is it?
2008-11-10T17:53:00.000Z	lilleman		but constantly, always?
2008-11-10T17:54:00.000Z	lilleman		Wasnt there in the last version...
2008-11-10T17:55:00.000Z	gammy	lilleman	I don't know about that stuff but that should be idle most of the time. it uses blocking functions so it shouldn't actuall *do* anything most of the time unless the source is actually being modified.
2008-11-10T17:55:00.000Z	lilleman		hm. It takes up resources for me. Constant load of ~0.22 when machine is completley idle
2008-11-10T17:56:00.000Z	gammy	lilleman	does "tail -f /var/run/klogd/kmsg" roll lots of text or is it not changing?
2008-11-10T17:56:00.000Z	lilleman		At a normal file transfer via SSH it takes up as much CPU as the sshd process
2008-11-10T17:56:00.000Z	lilleman	gammy	no
2008-11-10T17:56:00.000Z	gammy	lilleman	no what?
2008-11-10T17:56:00.000Z	lilleman		not changing
2008-11-10T17:57:00.000Z	gammy	lilleman	Ok. Then that shouldn't be taking any cputime at all.
2008-11-10T17:57:00.000Z	lilleman	gammy	31808 root      20   0  1940  544  448 S  1.3  0.1   0:29.21 dd
2008-11-10T17:57:00.000Z	lilleman		1.3% CPU
2008-11-10T17:57:00.000Z	lilleman		when doing absolutley nothing
2008-11-10T17:58:00.000Z	gammy	lilleman	Obviously it's doing something if it's taking cputime :P
