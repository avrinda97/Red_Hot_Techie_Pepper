2007-02-22T10:22:00.000Z	royel	Pancakes	take a break, you might consider trying to reinstall from livecd again :(   often if I have trouble with an install thats sometiems the easiest route for me
2007-02-22T10:23:00.000Z	royel	Pancakes	what he just said sounds like good advice
2007-02-22T10:25:00.000Z	royel	Pancakes	you can leave that partition, it wont hurt anything
2007-02-22T10:25:00.000Z	Pancakes	royel	won't it use up space?
2007-02-22T10:25:00.000Z	royel	Pancakes	yeah, but if your going to reinstall with teh alternate, you can address that space at that time
2007-02-22T10:27:00.000Z	royel	Pancakes	honestly, your just putting yourself thru more trouble than you should, it wont hurt a thing
2007-02-22T10:35:00.000Z	royel	Pancakes	what version of Suse?
2007-02-22T10:36:00.000Z	royel	Pancakes	I used Suse for a while, it's a good alternative to Ubuntu .. if you must :)
