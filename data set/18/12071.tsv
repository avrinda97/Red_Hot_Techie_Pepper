2006-06-10T06:22:00.000Z	Zambezi		I can't upload repos. I get error messages when I'm trying to install Gnome. It works in Breezy. How can I solve this?
2006-06-10T06:24:00.000Z	apokryphos	Zambezi	please pastebin the output
2006-06-10T06:24:00.000Z	Zambezi	apokryphos	It's on an other computer which is turned off. And it's i Swedish too. :-P
2006-06-10T06:26:00.000Z	Zambezi	apokryphos	It was something like: Failed to get. Some packed couldn't be downloaded. Temporary fail. Something like that.
2006-06-10T06:27:00.000Z	apokryphos	Zambezi	I recommend retrying in a couple of hours then
2006-06-10T06:28:00.000Z	Zambezi	apokryphos	Same fault a couple of days ago. And at the same time, it worked to update Breezy.
2006-06-10T06:28:00.000Z	apokryphos	Zambezi	you'd have to pastebin your sources.list then
2006-06-10T06:29:00.000Z	Zambezi	apokryphos	Will do if I can remote my computer. It's just serverinstall with no WM.
2006-06-10T06:43:00.000Z	Zambezi	apokryphos	It doesn't work to remote it, but the repos is unchanged from the installation.
2006-06-10T06:44:00.000Z	apokryphos	Zambezi	why doesn't remote work?
2006-06-10T06:45:00.000Z	Zambezi	apokryphos	I don't know. I installed openssh-server, but I'm not able to access.
2006-06-10T06:46:00.000Z	apokryphos	Zambezi	what's the error?
2006-06-10T06:46:00.000Z	Zambezi	apokryphos	Network error: Connection timed out.
2006-06-10T06:46:00.000Z	apokryphos	Zambezi	it's ssh package you want to install
2006-06-10T06:48:00.000Z	Zambezi	apokryphos	No. I installed it. I would to remote my f-ing computer so I can copy sources.list.
2006-10-31T07:58:00.000Z	Zambezi	apokryphos	We got him! Could you ban him here in this channel?
