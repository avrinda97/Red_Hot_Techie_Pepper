2011-05-06T01:00:00.000Z	JPP		if it boots then it will probably work.
2011-05-06T01:00:00.000Z	txomon	JPP	its a NAS
2011-05-06T01:01:00.000Z	txomon		I have system in a rom
2011-05-06T01:01:00.000Z	txomon		The main thing is how to disable RAID hardware
2011-05-06T01:01:00.000Z	JPP	txomon	a physical PC running as NAS? or one of those NAS boxes that you buy?
2011-05-06T01:02:00.000Z	txomon		nas box
2011-05-06T01:02:00.000Z	JPP		if it's the latter, consult the NAS manual or get in touch with their support.
2011-05-06T01:02:00.000Z	txomon	JPP	But I want to put my own kernel
2011-05-06T01:02:00.000Z	txomon		Ubuntu based
2011-05-06T01:02:00.000Z	JPP	txomon	I imagine it wouldn't be possible if it's hardware RAID though, as the controller may refuse to read an ex-RAID partition in normal RAID mode
2011-05-06T01:02:00.000Z	txomon		thats why
2011-05-06T01:03:00.000Z	JPP	txomon	consult your manual for the NAS Box, if it doesn't say you can you probably can't.
2011-05-06T01:03:00.000Z	JPP		but i'm only guessing here, as there are a lot of NAS boxes out there.
2011-05-06T01:03:00.000Z	txomon	JPP	the case is, I have 2 x2TB disks and I want RAID1 till I fill it, once filled, disable RAID1 and put as single devices
2011-05-06T01:04:00.000Z	JPP	txomon	Not sure if it would work when you unlink. It may insist to wipe the disk before it unlinks the array.
2011-05-06T01:05:00.000Z	JPP	txomon	Pretty sure no-one will be able to provide a definate answer unless they've tested it on the exact same box themselves.
2011-05-06T01:05:00.000Z	txomon	JPP	It is just as if would be a linux question, no matter where, as it uses linux kernel
2011-05-06T01:06:00.000Z	txomon	JPP	im gonna ask #kernel
