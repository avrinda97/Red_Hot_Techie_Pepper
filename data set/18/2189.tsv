2010-09-08T08:19:00.000Z	Livin4Jesus		Hello?
2010-09-08T08:21:00.000Z	Livin4Jesus		I'm having problems booting from the CD-ROM drive. I have a Compaq Presario 5000, and the CD-ROM is set to boot first, but it won't work. The MD5Sum it correct, everything should be working, but it's not. What am I doing wrong?
2010-09-08T08:21:00.000Z	Livin4Jesus		I've tried everything.
2010-09-08T08:21:00.000Z	Blue1	Livin4Jesus	have you tried another bootable cd?
2010-09-08T08:23:00.000Z	Blue1	Livin4Jesus	what about another bootable cd?
2010-09-08T08:23:00.000Z	Livin4Jesus	Blue1	What do you mean?
2010-09-08T08:23:00.000Z	Blue1	Livin4Jesus	have you tried another bootable cd, to see if that works.  this way we can isolate it to hardware or software.
2010-09-08T08:34:00.000Z	Blue1	Livin4Jesus	this begs the queston - what are you using to created the livecd (software wise?)
