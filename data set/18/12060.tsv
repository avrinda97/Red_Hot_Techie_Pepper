2006-05-30T08:18:00.000Z	distanceisdeath		No, I am not running Dapper. 5.10
2006-05-30T08:19:00.000Z	distanceisdeath		All right lemme try that.
2006-05-30T08:20:00.000Z	distanceisdeath		Grndslm, Where would it say Alsa?
2006-05-30T08:21:00.000Z	distanceisdeath		I see sound.
2006-05-30T08:21:00.000Z	distanceisdeath		AHHHH, Grndslm
2006-05-30T08:21:00.000Z	distanceisdeath		Found it, in face ALSA was not selected.
2006-05-30T08:21:00.000Z	distanceisdeath		fact*
2006-05-30T08:22:00.000Z	distanceisdeath		Yes, it does.
2006-05-30T08:22:00.000Z	distanceisdeath		But the real test, is music from the web.
2006-05-30T08:24:00.000Z	distanceisdeath		Grndslm, I still have no sound coming from mozilla.  What do I do?
2006-05-30T08:25:00.000Z	ion3lunix	distanceisdeath	install mozilla-mplayer
2006-05-30T08:27:00.000Z	ion3lunix	distanceisdeath	sudo aptitude install mozilla-mplayer
2006-05-30T08:34:00.000Z	ion3lunix	distanceisdeath	what webpage?
2006-05-30T08:36:00.000Z	ion3lunix	distanceisdeath	ic. it's a flash sound issue
2006-05-30T08:38:00.000Z	ion3lunix	distanceisdeath	so you see the flash movie but don't get sound?
2006-05-30T08:38:00.000Z	ion3lunix	distanceisdeath	edit /etc/firefox/firefoxrc
2006-05-30T08:38:00.000Z	ion3lunix	distanceisdeath	there's a line called FIREFOX_DSP. try changing it to "none" or "alsa" or "aoss" (After installing the alsa-oss package) and see what works
2006-05-30T08:40:00.000Z	ion3lunix	distanceisdeath	you also need to restart firefox for it to pickup the change. if you're not sure that firefox is totally closed, a killall firefox-bin will take care of that
