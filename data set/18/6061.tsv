2008-07-12T05:24:00.000Z	isor	eek	you trying to edit from hardy or fawn
2008-07-12T05:26:00.000Z	eek	isor	i'm in hardy thru root i've deleted fawn but have read only permissions in gui for the old fawn database
2008-07-12T05:28:00.000Z	eek	isor	my retarted way of fixing it is to gparted my old database partition to a smaller size after moving allowed files over to the hardy database :( lol
2008-07-12T05:29:00.000Z	isor	eek	what is in fawn database that you need to put into hardy
2008-07-12T05:31:00.000Z	eek		like 3 yrs of photos, 50G of mp3, work and school docs.
2008-07-12T05:31:00.000Z	eek	isor	like 3 yrs of photos, 50G of mp3, work and school docs.
2008-07-12T05:32:00.000Z	eek	isor	let's say I root my photos over to what little space i have GParted isn't even allowing me to resize/edit the old database partition
2008-07-12T05:34:00.000Z	isor	eek	is the database a single file holding all the photos and mp3's
2008-07-12T05:35:00.000Z	eek	isor	excuse my lack of nerd vocabulary but i believe its a tree  or folders w/in folder
2008-07-12T05:36:00.000Z	isor	eek	 ok and it won't let ya get into the folder or move the folder to your hardy partition
2008-07-12T05:37:00.000Z	eek	isor	in root thr term i can move and delete but the old partition is 66GB the new hardy is 5GB  so even if I move what I want i cant write on the 66GB of my old partition! :(
2008-07-12T05:39:00.000Z	isor	eek	did you say you deleted the fawn partition
2008-07-12T05:39:00.000Z	eek	isor	nope just the os in the partition
2008-07-12T05:42:00.000Z	isor	eek	i take it 66gig partition can't be resized cuz of all the files and you can get to em as root but you want to get them as user did you try as root to change the database from root to the user name
2008-07-12T05:45:00.000Z	eek	isor	there is some space but it wont let me resize..thats what i was planning on. as far as changing user name i'm not sure how to thru terminal and it wont allow me via the gui.  also I should mention that the 66G partition must be mounted before viewing ?? i dont know why either
2008-07-12T05:48:00.000Z	isor	eek	 no 2nd drive you can use as a temp to move files to?
2008-07-12T05:51:00.000Z	eek	isor	lol so i do have one and i tried formatting last week but it dint work  so here i am as we speak trying to reformt it the onlything different i did was open GParted in a term as root instead of using the gui and it work!!!  cant believe it so now i'm going to chase that tail.
2008-07-12T05:52:00.000Z	isor	eek	 if you did get it formated might be better to put hardy on it rather than on a 5g partition
