2008-11-07T07:19:00.000Z	dfsadf		someone HELP please? I just got a new Dell Studio 15 with Ubuntu and when I start it up, after the dell screen and the ubuntu loading screen the screen turns to white and doesnt respond to anything. I tried reinstalling but that didnt help. I think it has something to do with the video card or resolution settings. This is the third replacement laptop I've received for this problem (i assumed it was factory error)... HELP??
