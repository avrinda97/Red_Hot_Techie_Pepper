2009-12-21T20:57:00.000Z	grawity	rd1381	of course.
2009-12-21T21:00:00.000Z	rd1381	grawity	how?
2009-12-21T21:01:00.000Z	grawity	rd1381	Create a second user account, and don't add it to 'admin' group.
2009-12-21T21:03:00.000Z	grawity	rd1381	No, it never was in the sudo config file.
2009-12-21T21:03:00.000Z	grawity	rd1381	Only the 'admin' group is in sudoers.
2009-12-21T21:08:00.000Z	grawity	rd1381	In other words, enable the root account, right?
2009-12-21T21:09:00.000Z	rd1381	grawity	somehow yes but not a root account , an account that has admin access but not root
2009-12-21T21:09:00.000Z	grawity	rd1381	I don't know if that is possible in Unix.
2009-12-21T21:10:00.000Z	rd1381	grawity	imean i want a normal account and an admin account and the ability to install app in normal account after asking for admin account passs
2009-12-21T21:10:00.000Z	grawity	rd1381	Ubuntu's (and Linux in general) "admin" accounts don't have any privileges. They just can use 'sudo' to temporarily switch to the root account.
2009-12-21T21:11:00.000Z	grawity	rd1381	Only 'root' is an equivalent of Windows "administrator".
2009-12-21T21:11:00.000Z	rd1381	grawity	iknowe
2009-12-21T21:12:00.000Z	rd1381	grawity	but i want to whan asked for password for installing apps for it to ask another account pass not my normal account
2009-12-21T21:12:00.000Z	grawity	rd1381	You can go into gconf-editor, and disable /apps/gksu/sudo-mode. BUT it will be useless without a root account, because other accounts do not have any privileges at all.
2009-12-21T21:16:00.000Z	grawity	rd1381	Seriously, what's wrong with enabling root?
2009-12-21T21:16:00.000Z	grawity	rd1381	Then you would have exactly the same behavior as in Windows.
2009-12-21T21:16:00.000Z	rd1381	grawity	enabling root? no because i want the sudo ability not whole of root
