2012-02-15T19:29:00.000Z	prashant_123456	kroonrs	then
2012-02-15T19:30:00.000Z	kroonrs	prashant_123456	on the terminal, try running "grep "User Name" /etc/passwd" on the terminal, with the username you are trying to log in with
2012-02-15T19:31:00.000Z	kroonrs	prashant_123456	you should get some colon-separated fields, with User Name in the fifth field
2012-02-15T19:32:00.000Z	prashant_123456	kroonrs	there what should i find
2012-02-15T19:32:00.000Z	kroonrs	prashant_123456	you should get some colon-separated fields, with User Name in the fifth field
2012-02-15T19:32:00.000Z	kroonrs	prashant_123456	your login name for the console is in the first field
2012-02-15T19:33:00.000Z	prashant_123456	kroonrs	root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
2012-02-15T19:33:00.000Z	prashant_123456	kroonrs	its the first line
2012-02-15T19:34:00.000Z	kroonrs	prashant_123456	ok, so then it's not the login name that's a problem.  Can you on the terminal run "su root"
2012-02-15T19:34:00.000Z	prashant_123456	kroonrs	yep
2012-02-15T19:35:00.000Z	kroonrs	prashant_123456	does it prompt you for a password?
2012-02-15T19:35:00.000Z	prashant_123456	kroonrs	yep
2012-02-15T19:35:00.000Z	kroonrs	prashant_123456	hold on a sec: are you actually logged in to your gui as root?
2012-02-15T19:36:00.000Z	prashant_123456	kroonrs	it says auth failure while i put password in it
2012-02-15T19:36:00.000Z	kroonrs	prashant_123456	are you actually logged in to your gui as root? if so, you would not be prompted for a password when you typed "su root", I think.
2012-02-15T19:37:00.000Z	prashant_123456	kroonrs	but it requires password
2012-02-15T19:38:00.000Z	kroonrs	prashant_123456	yashshah: I have to go now, unfortunately.  It seems you are not logged in as root, so root can't be the correct login credentials for you.
2012-02-15T19:39:00.000Z	prashant_123456	kroonrs	thanks for the help
