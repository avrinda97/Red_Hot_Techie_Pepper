2006-04-30T06:31:00.000Z	Rudemeister		me got a problem compiling something:
2006-04-30T06:31:00.000Z	Rudemeister		checking size of off_t... configure: error: Unsupported off_t size
2006-04-30T06:31:00.000Z	Rudemeister		what does it mean
2006-04-30T06:31:00.000Z	kingspawn	Rudemeister	what are you compiling?
2006-04-30T06:32:00.000Z	Rudemeister	kingspawn	irssi
2006-04-30T06:32:00.000Z	kingspawn	Rudemeister	do you strictly need to compile?
2006-04-30T06:32:00.000Z	Rudemeister	kingspawn	yes, its _not_ on my ubuntu box
2006-04-30T06:33:00.000Z	kingspawn	Rudemeister	where is it? and we'll need a bit more meat on the error-bone
2006-04-30T06:33:00.000Z	Rudemeister	kingspawn	well, that's the only error, when compiling (actually, the ./configure part) on a hp-ux box..
2006-04-30T06:34:00.000Z	kingspawn	Rudemeister	well, seems like you need to get down and dirty, trying to find out what this off_t is defined as
2006-04-30T06:35:00.000Z	Rudemeister	kingspawn	true , I am already swimming in the Makefile:)
2006-04-30T06:35:00.000Z	kingspawn	Rudemeister	won't find it there, which file is it compiling when the error occurs? likely its in there/headers it includes
2006-04-30T06:36:00.000Z	Rudemeister	kingspawn	got this:
2006-04-30T06:46:00.000Z	Rudemeister	kingspawn	it seems to go wrong the the --with-file-offset-size option
2006-04-30T06:48:00.000Z	kingspawn	Rudemeister	tried the easy way out and just disabling it? ;)
2006-04-30T06:48:00.000Z	Rudemeister	kingspawn	I thought I did but dont really know how
2006-04-30T06:49:00.000Z	kingspawn	Rudemeister	This is an option passed to gcc via Makefile?
2006-04-30T06:50:00.000Z	Rudemeister	kingspawn	merely an option given to configure
