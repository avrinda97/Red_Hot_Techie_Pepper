2011-05-05T05:21:00.000Z	Cheese		Im installing fedora with  windows and ubuntu, and the windows partition is taking up all the free space. I have tons of freespace on the windows partition, so if i shrhink the windows partition, will it automatically make a new partition with the free space?
2011-05-05T05:22:00.000Z	Cheese		Anyone can just answer this real quick?

2011-05-05T05:30:00.000Z	Cheese		or will it take up data for the partition
2011-05-05T05:30:00.000Z	dsnyders	Cheese	No.  You have to resize another partition to claim that space or make a new one
2011-05-05T05:33:00.000Z	dsnyders	Cheese	Always back up your important stuff before playing with partitions
2011-05-05T05:34:00.000Z	Cheese	dsnyders	i dont have anything to back it up on
2011-05-05T05:35:00.000Z	dsnyders	Cheese	If you're really worried about it, there are freeware partition shrinkers that work in windows.
2011-05-05T05:36:00.000Z	dsnyders	Cheese	BTW, you are aware that this is an ubuntu support forum, right?
2011-05-05T05:39:00.000Z	dsnyders	Cheese	It's up to you, but leave a few gig of free space for Windows
2011-05-05T05:42:00.000Z	dsnyders	Cheese	It depends on the installer.  If it doesn't autodetect them, you can still add them manually.
2011-05-05T05:43:00.000Z	dsnyders	Cheese	You'd have to know where they boot from.  However, that sort of question would be better asked in a Fedora forum, as it is the fedora installer that would be doing the work.
