2005-01-04T10:40:00.000Z	lordan		smbclient //host/share -U user
2005-01-04T10:42:00.000Z	lordan		Or if you want smbmount //host/share /mountpoint
2005-01-04T10:43:00.000Z	Cloudchaser_	lordan	i can't mount the share with that command
2005-01-04T10:44:00.000Z	lordan	Cloudchaser_	hmm.. it should work
2005-01-04T10:49:00.000Z	lordan	Cloudchaser_	are you never able to connect using Nautilus, or it works sometimes?
2005-01-04T10:49:00.000Z	Cloudchaser_	lordan	never
2005-01-04T10:52:00.000Z	lordan	Cloudchaser_	there's a services gui in gnome-system-tools
2005-01-04T10:53:00.000Z	Cloudchaser_	lordan	so i can apt get that?
2005-01-04T10:53:00.000Z	Cloudchaser_	lordan	i found it in apt-cache search..i have to compile it myself?
2005-01-04T10:55:00.000Z	lordan	Cloudchaser_	I tend to agree.
2005-01-04T10:56:00.000Z	lordan	Cloudchaser_	I do have that problem at times
2005-01-04T11:00:00.000Z	Cloudchaser_	lordan	its a windows pc and hmm let me set up a user named root
2005-01-04T11:04:00.000Z	lordan	Cloudchaser_	does it go straight on to tell you that you don't have permission instead?
2005-01-04T11:05:00.000Z	Cloudchaser_	lordan	remember i can mount the share from command line and view the file listings
2005-01-04T11:06:00.000Z	lordan	Cloudchaser_	I also experience the same thing from time to time.
2005-01-04T11:08:00.000Z	lordan	Cloudchaser_	I'll investigate after a few hours of sleep..
2005-01-04T11:09:00.000Z	lordan	Cloudchaser_	for the time being you may have to use smbclient or smbmount
2005-01-04T11:10:00.000Z	lordan	Cloudchaser_	not really, at least not if you use smbmount
