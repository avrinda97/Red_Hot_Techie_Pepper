2009-10-23T01:31:00.000Z	acerpup	maco	you're busy today aren't you
2009-10-23T01:34:00.000Z	acerpup	maco	have you ever done a minimal install?
2009-10-23T01:34:00.000Z	maco	acerpup	yes
2009-10-23T01:34:00.000Z	maco	acerpup	he may mean in ubuntu....
2009-10-23T01:34:00.000Z	acerpup	maco	did your wifi work?
2009-10-23T01:34:00.000Z	maco	acerpup	yeah. i did a server install then installed X, then did networking from command line
2009-10-23T01:35:00.000Z	acerpup	maco	so instead of the minimal cd you think I should get the server iso?
2009-10-23T01:35:00.000Z	maco	acerpup	server cd lets you do a minimal install, but it gives a different kernel that doenst work on very old hardware. are you referring to mini.iso?
2009-10-23T01:36:00.000Z	acerpup	maco	yes mini
2009-10-23T01:36:00.000Z	maco	acerpup	mini.iso is for installation over a wired network
2009-10-23T01:36:00.000Z	maco	acerpup	the final result supports wireless, but not the installer
2009-10-23T01:37:00.000Z	acerpup	maco	i am just beginning this journey, bought some command line books
2009-10-23T01:39:00.000Z	acerpup	maco	I was just wondering is wubi even a good way to install ubuntu? is it more like a frugal install?
2009-10-23T01:39:00.000Z	maco	acerpup	its fine, just make sure you defrag windows first so theres a large enough contiguous space
2009-10-23T01:43:00.000Z	acerpup	maco	is fluxbuntu pretty much a dead project now?
2009-10-23T01:43:00.000Z	maco	acerpup	no idea
