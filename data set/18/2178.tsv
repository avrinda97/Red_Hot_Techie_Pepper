2011-02-14T20:54:00.000Z	rapture		Is there any way to fix permissions system-wide?
2011-02-14T20:55:00.000Z	rapture		lol
2011-02-14T20:56:00.000Z	rapture		through a hilarious series of events involving dying hard disks and rsync I've got a system that runs but has lots of broken permissions
2011-02-14T20:56:00.000Z	rapture		I've set my ~ to 0777
2011-02-14T20:57:00.000Z	rapture		rumpel, I'm considering it, but to be quite honest, I've spent so long getting MythTV to work that it seems a little depressing to start over
2011-02-14T20:58:00.000Z	rapture		rumpel - perhaps when I can afford enough hard disks/BR burners to have one
2011-02-14T20:58:00.000Z	rapture		as a student I'm afraid I do not have the cash to back up 2+TB on a regular basis
2011-02-14T20:59:00.000Z	rapture		I think I just need to learn the intricacies of rsync better
2011-02-14T20:59:00.000Z	needlez	rapture	couldn't you use umask to set permissions for all new files and such?? just wondering if that would help
2011-02-14T21:01:00.000Z	rapture	needlez	what does umask do?
2011-02-14T21:03:00.000Z	needlez	rapture	umask, allows you to set properties for new files and folders that you install or download automatically from what my teacher was explaining. you can give it any permissions like you would give chmod but the values are different numbers but have the same effects as far as rwx rwx rwx or rw rw  rw or whatever you set them for
2011-02-14T21:05:00.000Z	rapture	needlez	hmm, that doesn't really help
2011-02-14T21:05:00.000Z	needlez	rapture	ok, then I prolly misunderstood what you were trying to do
2011-02-14T21:05:00.000Z	rapture	needlez	basically I've broken loads of permissions on my system
2011-02-14T21:06:00.000Z	needlez	rapture	you could system wide reset them to just -rw or something with chmod i believe, not sure how though
2011-02-14T21:15:00.000Z	needlez	rapture	go make it yourself
2011-02-14T21:15:00.000Z	rapture	needlez	I'd rather starve.
2011-02-14T21:16:00.000Z	needlez	rapture	you shouldve said sudo go make me a sandwich then id have no choice but to do so
