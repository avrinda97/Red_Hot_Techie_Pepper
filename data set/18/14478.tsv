2006-03-29T16:31:00.000Z	variant		hi all, will the ubuntu installer automatically resize windows partitions and set up a dual boot if required?
2006-03-29T16:32:00.000Z	bimberi	variant	yes it will - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/forum/installation/Partitioning
2006-03-29T16:33:00.000Z	variant	bimberi	great thanks, is there a graphical installer or is it just curses based?
2006-03-29T16:34:00.000Z	bimberi	variant	curses it's curses :)
2006-03-29T16:35:00.000Z	variant	bimberi	huh?
2006-03-29T16:35:00.000Z	variant	bimberi	oh nm hehe :P
2006-03-29T16:35:00.000Z	bimberi	variant	a pathetic attempt at humour :P
2006-03-29T16:36:00.000Z	variant	bimberi	indeed :)
2006-11-17T07:53:00.000Z	bimberi	variant	'export CC=/usr/bin/gcc3.3'   (iird)
2006-11-17T07:56:00.000Z	variant	bimberi	after that gcc -v shows gcc 4.1.2
2006-11-17T07:56:00.000Z	bimberi	variant	yes it would.  Are you about to ./configure ... make ... etc. ?
2006-11-17T07:57:00.000Z	variant	bimberi	just make, there is no autoconf with this module
2006-11-17T07:57:00.000Z	variant	bimberi	im getting errors compiling unionfs module so just though i would give gcc3 a try
2006-11-17T07:59:00.000Z	bimberi	variant	yes, i'm not sure sorry, I've seen that recommended for the ./configure/make/make-install dance.  if /usr/bin/gcc points to /etc/alternatives/???? then update-alternatives would be the way
2006-11-17T08:00:00.000Z	variant	bimberi	ln -sf /usr/bin/gcc-3.4 /usr/bin/gcc did the trick
2006-11-17T08:00:00.000Z	bimberi	variant	indeed it should have :)
2006-11-17T08:00:00.000Z	variant	bimberi	damn lol, same error  om make :)
2006-11-17T08:00:00.000Z	bimberi	variant	:/
