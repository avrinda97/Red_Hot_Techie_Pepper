2004-12-31T09:09:00.000Z	rjek		Is there a way of getting esd to listen on TCP publically? It seems to ignore /etc/esound/esd.conf
2004-12-31T09:09:00.000Z	rjek		And the sound configuration just has a tick box to enable automatically starting esd.
2004-12-31T09:10:00.000Z	Rotund	rjek	you killed esd and restarted it?
2004-12-31T09:10:00.000Z	rjek	Rotund	I can kill it and restart it manually with my choice of switches, yes.
2004-12-31T09:11:00.000Z	rjek	Rotund	It doesn't open a public port by default.  I want to change that.  If I kill the one it starts, and start my own with the right switches, it works.
2004-12-31T09:12:00.000Z	Rotund	rjek	what did you add to esd.conf?
2004-12-31T09:12:00.000Z	rjek	Rotund	-tcp -public -promiscuous
2004-12-31T09:13:00.000Z	Rotund	rjek	you could try polypaudio
2004-12-31T09:13:00.000Z	rjek	Rotund	I could, if I had any idea what it was. :)
2004-12-31T09:14:00.000Z	Rotund	rjek	Another implementation of a mixer that's ESD compat.
2004-12-31T09:14:00.000Z	rjek	Rotund	OK.  Say I use that.  How do you tell Gnome to use that instead? :)
2004-12-31T09:14:00.000Z	Rotund	rjek	It just does
2004-12-31T09:14:00.000Z	Rotund	rjek	*shrug* it just works for me =)
2004-12-31T09:15:00.000Z	Rotund	rjek	yes, makes it's own esd
2004-12-31T09:25:00.000Z	rjek	Rotund	OK.  polypaudio.  How do you actually get it to listen on TCP?
2004-12-31T09:25:00.000Z	Rotund	rjek	no clue =)
2004-12-31T09:25:00.000Z	rjek	Rotund	Running with -tcp -public -promiscuous doesn't, and I've changed its config file such that it loads the esound-tcp module.
2004-12-31T09:26:00.000Z	Rotund	rjek	google for it and it should help
