2008-02-21T10:52:00.000Z	StaggerLee	usr13	do you have time to give my log a look? http://rafb.net/p/oDYsCg35.html
2008-02-21T10:54:00.000Z	usr13	StaggerLee	Your wireless connection appears to be working ok.
2008-02-21T10:55:00.000Z	StaggerLee	usr13	so you guys have do not have an idea why this is happening to me?
2008-02-21T10:56:00.000Z	usr13	StaggerLee	What nameservers are you using?
2008-02-21T10:58:00.000Z	usr13	StaggerLee	What nameservers are you using?
2008-02-21T10:58:00.000Z	StaggerLee	usr13	195.210.91.100
2008-02-21T10:58:00.000Z	StaggerLee	usr13	and 193.70.192.25
2008-02-21T10:59:00.000Z	usr13	StaggerLee	Verify your nameservers.  Plug them in one at a time and do host av.com   or   host yahoo.com  or  host google.com  and verify that each one is resolving domain names.
2008-02-21T11:00:00.000Z	usr13	StaggerLee	See how fast they resolve a domain name for you.  One may be responding very slow.  The fastest one should be first in the list.
2008-02-21T11:01:00.000Z	usr13	StaggerLee	Try using the router's IP address.  (Most routers have caching name server enabled, and if it is not, enable it, and use it for  primary nameserver.)
2008-02-21T11:01:00.000Z	StaggerLee	usr13	i get the problems when i use the autodetected dns, when i use the one i told you i am fine
2008-02-21T11:01:00.000Z	usr13	StaggerLee	nameserver 192.168.1.1
2008-02-21T11:02:00.000Z	StaggerLee	usr13	yes, it is when i use 192.168.1.1 as nameserver for dns that i cant connect to xchat, pidgin or synaptic repositories
2008-02-21T11:02:00.000Z	usr13	StaggerLee	If one of the nameservers is slow or un-reliable, report it to your ISP and ask for an alternative.
2008-02-21T11:03:00.000Z	usr13	StaggerLee	See that the router's caching nameserver is turned on.  And that it has the fastest, most reliable nameserver at top of it's list.)
2008-02-21T11:03:00.000Z	usr13	StaggerLee	Check the router's WAN settings.
2008-02-21T11:05:00.000Z	usr13	StaggerLee	If  you find that one of the suggested nameserver's is not working or not performing well, report it to your ISP.
