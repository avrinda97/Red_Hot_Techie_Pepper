2006-06-01T15:37:00.000Z	eobanb	JonnyBoy	the command is sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2006-06-01T15:39:00.000Z	JonnyBoy	eobanb	i tried that, but it said that x-server-xorg is not installed
2006-06-01T15:40:00.000Z	eobanb	JonnyBoy	that's because the package is xserver-xorg, not x-server-xorg
2006-06-01T15:40:00.000Z	eobanb	JonnyBoy	you must type the EXACT command for it to work
2006-06-01T15:44:00.000Z	JonnyBoy	eobanb	ok. i started the reconfiguration of xserver-xorg
2006-06-01T15:44:00.000Z	JonnyBoy	eobanb	how do i know which video card driver i supposed to select?
2006-06-01T15:44:00.000Z	eobanb	JonnyBoy	well what video card do you have?
2006-06-01T15:45:00.000Z	JonnyBoy	eobanb	what cmd do i use to check?
2006-06-01T15:46:00.000Z	JonnyBoy	eobanb	Is there a command that I can type so I can find out what video card I have?
2006-06-01T15:59:00.000Z	JonnyBoy	eobanb	i went through the configuration of xserver-xorg, but that didn't help
2006-06-01T15:59:00.000Z	JonnyBoy	eobanb	rebooted, and went into normal mode - Said that the xserver failed to load
2006-06-02T16:00:00.000Z	JonnyBoy	eobanb	it said that i needed to restart the GDM
