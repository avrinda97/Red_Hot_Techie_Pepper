2007-05-16T13:49:00.000Z	|_ocke		sudo apt-cache search ncurses
2007-05-16T13:49:00.000Z	|_ocke		sudo apt-cache search libcurses
2007-05-16T13:49:00.000Z	RAOF	|_ocke	You know, you don't need the "sudo" there.  "apt-cache search libncurses" works.
2007-05-18T10:14:00.000Z	RAOF	|_ocke	*5gb* swap?  what are you doing, simulating the earth's weather?
2007-05-18T10:15:00.000Z	|_ocke	RAOF	im using LAMP plus secondlife plus firefox plus whatever else i wanna do
2007-05-18T10:15:00.000Z	RAOF	|_ocke	5Gb of swap is almost certainly 4Gb too much :)
2007-05-18T10:16:00.000Z	RAOF	|_ocke	And for your /home partition, you just want to copy across your existing stuff, and change fstab
2007-05-18T10:17:00.000Z	RAOF	|_ocke	That slowness *isn't* going to go away with more swap :)
2007-05-18T10:18:00.000Z	RAOF	|_ocke	No, it still would slow to unresponsive, it's just the OOM killer wouldn't kick in as early :)
2007-05-18T10:20:00.000Z	RAOF	|_ocke	Yeah, having more than 512mb swap would probably be useful for you :).  Still, /slow as mollasses/
