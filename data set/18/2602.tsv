2010-04-18T07:47:00.000Z	gbear14275		anyone able to point me to a gui I can use to configure /etc/network/interfaces... I'm having a hard time doing this
2010-04-18T07:48:00.000Z	gbear14275		sudo: network-manager: command not found
2010-04-18T07:49:00.000Z	crucialhoax	gbear14275	sudo nm-applet
2010-04-18T07:49:00.000Z	gbear14275	crucialhoax	this is a headless server I'm trying to configure through ssh
2010-04-18T07:49:00.000Z	gbear14275	crucialhoax	nm-applet wont work will it
2010-04-18T07:50:00.000Z	crucialhoax	gbear14275	Nevermind then, if it is using a wired connection, network is not needed, unless in your case it is?
2010-04-18T07:51:00.000Z	gbear14275	crucialhoax	blacksunseven:  I'm trying to get my headless machine to use an eth1 interface it has.  eth1 though is not listed in /etc/network/interfaces and I'm having a hard time understanding how to set it up... was hoping for something I could forward through ssh
2010-04-18T07:52:00.000Z	crucialhoax	gbear14275	Is it listed under `ifconfig -a`
2010-04-18T07:52:00.000Z	gbear14275	crucialhoax	yes :) (first sign of hope)
2010-04-18T07:54:00.000Z	crucialhoax	gbear14275	Ok, and so I understand you are trying to configure eth1 on a server thru ssh?
2010-04-18T07:57:00.000Z	gbear14275	crucialhoax	so to answer your question... yes
2010-04-18T07:59:00.000Z	crucialhoax	gbear14275	One second, I have been reading through tutorials lately and I know I read one on how to edit the system files to use a connection, without NM
2010-04-18T08:00:00.000Z	crucialhoax	gbear14275	I think this might be it... http://www.ubuntugeek.com/ubuntu-networking-configuration-using-command-line.html
2010-04-18T08:01:00.000Z	gbear14275	crucialhoax	awesome thanks!
2010-04-18T08:02:00.000Z	crucialhoax	gbear14275	Is that what you are looking for?
2010-04-18T08:02:00.000Z	gbear14275	crucialhoax	yeah I think that will work
2010-04-18T08:02:00.000Z	crucialhoax	gbear14275	Great! :)
