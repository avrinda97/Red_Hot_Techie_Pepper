2011-07-12T16:43:00.000Z	Dudi		hey guys I have big problem with NVIDIA Drivers... I go with this tut http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=9769396&postcount=2 but after restart GDM didn't start
2011-07-12T16:43:00.000Z	szal	Dudi	and what's wrong w/ the packaged nvidia driver that you don't use that?
2011-07-12T16:44:00.000Z	Dudi	szal	do what?
2011-07-12T16:45:00.000Z	szal	Dudi	read again, I think I made myself clear enough
2011-07-12T16:45:00.000Z	szal	Dudi	and yes, what card?
2011-07-12T16:47:00.000Z	szal	Dudi	'sudo nvidia-installer --uninstall' (if you already ran the binary script) '&& sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install nvidia-current && sudo nvidia-xconfig', then reboot
2011-07-12T16:47:00.000Z	Dudi	szal	I have no internet connection
2011-07-12T16:47:00.000Z	szal	Dudi	how are you here then?
2011-07-12T16:48:00.000Z	Dudi	szal	I will have if I restore Xorg then I will have... With netbook
2011-07-12T16:49:00.000Z	szal	Dudi	then run only 'sudo nvidia-installer --uninstall', it should revert you to the nouveau driver
2011-07-12T16:49:00.000Z	Dudi	szal	ok wait..
2011-07-12T16:50:00.000Z	szal	Dudi	and don't forget to un-blacklist the nouveau driver
2011-07-12T16:50:00.000Z	szal	Dudi	and possibly some of the fb drivers too, no idea which one
2011-07-12T16:51:00.000Z	Dudi	szal	aaa damn
2011-07-12T17:01:00.000Z	Dudi	szal	I uninstall driver and now nothing shows up
2011-07-12T17:02:00.000Z	szal	Dudi	did you a) make sure you deleted /etc/X11/xorg.conf, and b) un-blacklist nouveau?
2011-07-12T17:03:00.000Z	Dudi	szal	I did not do any of it because no1 say "do it"... damn
2011-07-12T17:04:00.000Z	Dudi	szal	it's like "and remember do backup your data befor any actions" at the end of tutorial
