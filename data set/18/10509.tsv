2006-12-09T15:30:00.000Z	marginoferror	gotit	a swap partition is helpful but not strictly required
2006-12-09T15:31:00.000Z	gotit	marginoferror	hou much memory do you have
2006-12-09T15:38:00.000Z	marginoferror	gotit	That sounds very difficult

2006-12-09T15:42:00.000Z	gotit	marginoferror	i cant plug it in cause  i am using it
2006-12-09T15:42:00.000Z	marginoferror	gotit	I heard you, but you will have to work around that somehow
2006-12-09T15:45:00.000Z	marginoferror	gotit	I'm sorry, I don't really know how
2006-12-09T15:46:00.000Z	marginoferror	gotit	I suggest you find some other way to connect to the internet - an old modem, if necessary - so you can get help and plug it in at the same time
2006-12-09T16:04:00.000Z	marginoferror	gotit	we are out of suggestions.  You either need to install the DSL yourself without internet assistance, or find a way to access the internet while the DSL modem is plugged into the computer to be set up
2006-12-09T16:04:00.000Z	marginoferror	gotit	 Good luck.
2006-12-09T16:04:00.000Z	marginoferror	gotit	Yes, purchasing a DSL modem with ethernet support is definitely the best option
2006-12-09T16:04:00.000Z	gotit	marginoferror	no its not
2006-12-09T16:05:00.000Z	gotit	marginoferror	you dont know wat i have to do latter with it
2006-12-09T16:06:00.000Z	gotit	marginoferror	at least give me some thing that i can try when i will not be connected/pluging adsl in ubuntu to install
