2009-02-01T11:51:00.000Z	bz0b		hey guys im trying to figure out how to make a usb drive bootable with an iso in ubuntu but the iso is of a different os
2009-02-01T11:52:00.000Z	Quack[stinkpad]	bz0b	if it's a windows iso then you probably gotta do it from a windows machine :/
2009-02-01T11:52:00.000Z	bz0b	Quack[stinkpad]	yes
2009-02-01T11:52:00.000Z	Quack[stinkpad]		cause you have to run bootsect from the cd's boot directory
2009-02-01T11:52:00.000Z	Quack[stinkpad]		from the windows console, bootsect /nt60 drive letter
2009-02-01T11:53:00.000Z	Quack[stinkpad]		that's how i did it yesterday....i've been trying to get a bootable windows 7 cd
2009-02-01T11:53:00.000Z	Quack[stinkpad]		flash drive rather
2009-02-01T11:53:00.000Z	bz0b	Quack[stinkpad]	well i have a macbook and i have refit (for booting purposes) and i have  a 2g usb drive and i need the wintendo to run a program that is not supported in linux
2009-02-01T11:54:00.000Z	Quack[stinkpad]		hmm i see
2009-02-01T11:54:00.000Z	Quack[stinkpad]		is wine able to use the windows command line?
2009-02-01T11:54:00.000Z	bz0b	Quack[stinkpad]	so if i copy the iso to a xp machine i reformatt the usb to what format?
2009-02-01T11:55:00.000Z	bz0b	Quack[stinkpad]	does unetbootin work for that
2009-02-01T11:56:00.000Z	Quack[stinkpad]		i dunno, alls i know is how i did it :/
2009-02-01T11:56:00.000Z	Quack[stinkpad]		it might work in fat32, but mine was done in ntfs
2009-02-01T11:56:00.000Z	Quack[stinkpad]		i ran bootsect from the cd's boot folder
2009-02-01T11:56:00.000Z	Quack[stinkpad]		basically you extract the iso and copy the contents to the flash drive
2009-02-01T11:56:00.000Z	Quack[stinkpad]		then once you do, bootsect that shiet homie. if you can use windows command line from wine, then just use wine to do it
2009-02-01T11:57:00.000Z	bz0b	Quack[stinkpad]	ok ill try it out
