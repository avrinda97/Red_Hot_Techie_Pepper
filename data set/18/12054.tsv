2006-05-31T06:51:00.000Z	Dextorion		hi, just did a apt-get dist-upgrade and it broke my nvida driver? I've tried to run the nvidia-installer script, just as before. But it wont work.  Anyone have a pointer for me, what im doing wrong?
2006-05-31T06:52:00.000Z	scheuri	Dextorion	probably your kernel got updated...you probably need a new driver downloaded
2006-05-31T06:52:00.000Z	Dextorion	scheuri	uname -r says the same as before. Its a kernel i compiled myself
2006-05-31T06:52:00.000Z	scheuri	Dextorion	oh, sorry...then I dont know...maybe so xorg-changes??
2006-05-31T06:53:00.000Z	Dextorion	scheuri	it was xorg.. or desktop chnges anyways.  but.. i just cant find what to do.
2006-05-31T06:53:00.000Z	scheuri	Dextorion	I am afraid I cant help that much as I am not using binary drivers so far
2006-05-31T06:54:00.000Z	scheuri	Dextorion	did you check of update made a new xorg.conf??
2006-05-31T06:54:00.000Z	Dextorion	scheuri	:) allrigty. Thanks anyways!
2006-05-31T06:54:00.000Z	Dextorion	scheuri	yupp, it didnt.
2006-05-31T06:54:00.000Z	scheuri	Dextorion	uuuhh...then I am really at my limits
2006-05-31T06:54:00.000Z	Dextorion	scheuri	and Nvidia script says it compiled and installed the driver correctly. but when i start x it says it cant find the module
2006-05-31T06:55:00.000Z	Dextorion	scheuri	just like xorg changed where it looks for modules in the update or something
2006-05-31T06:55:00.000Z	scheuri	Dextorion	did you reload your X?
2006-05-31T06:55:00.000Z	Dextorion	scheuri	sure
2006-05-31T06:55:00.000Z	scheuri	Dextorion	complete reboot?
2006-05-31T06:55:00.000Z	Dextorion	scheuri	ya ;)
2006-05-31T06:56:00.000Z	scheuri	Dextorion	*sighs*...sorry then
2006-05-31T06:56:00.000Z	Dextorion	scheuri	:) its okay mate. i'll figure something out.  Or someone will :D
