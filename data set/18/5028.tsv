2009-02-24T18:24:00.000Z	grandrew		hi all! Is there anything like "/etc/init.d/iptables save" or other iptables - save/restore auto script in ubuntu?
2009-02-24T18:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	grandrew	type iptab then press tab a few times, see what comes out
2010-03-19T15:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	grandrew	i got 3Mb as my highest which is xorg. Try closing it then reopening it. See if it happens again. Do you use hibernate etc?
2010-03-19T15:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	grandrew	3% sorry, misread
2010-03-19T15:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	grandrew	its not in the top 20 anyhoo
2012-02-27T22:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	grandrew	find in terminal is pretty sweet, or you can run: sudo updatedb   then use the locate command to find files
2012-02-27T22:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	grandrew	find has an age option in it
2012-02-27T22:18:00.000Z	grandrew	ActionParsnip	I just wanted anything with graphical UI :-(
2012-02-27T22:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	grandrew	why?
2012-02-27T22:18:00.000Z	grandrew	ActionParsnip	because I thought ubuntu has made a step towards the usability .. at last :(
2012-02-27T22:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	grandrew	there are searching apps but I don'y knoe them personally. find is very usable...
2012-02-27T22:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	grandrew	ust because you are  typing stuff doesn't make it not usable...
2012-02-27T22:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	grandrew	sudo find/ -type f -mtime +3       willfind all files older than 3 days...
2012-02-27T22:21:00.000Z	grandrew	ActionParsnip	yes it does make it less usable since you have to dig in man pages instead of just clicking and doing it
2012-02-27T22:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	grandrew	there are sample commands online, that's where I got that. never used a man page
2012-02-27T22:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	grandrew	if you can learn CLI stuff, it will benefit you later
2012-02-27T22:35:00.000Z	grandrew	ActionParsnip	yep I've googled-out the solution: 1. create a temp file, touch it to DATE1, 2. create a second tmp file with DATE2, then find -cnewer ./date1 ... ! -cnewer ./date2... yep, THATS user friendly!?!
2012-02-27T22:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	grandrew	i'd say so
