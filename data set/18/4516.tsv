2009-03-29T06:02:00.000Z	Kevdog	blinkin_gremlin	How about gnome terminal?
2009-03-29T06:02:00.000Z	blinkin_gremlin	Kevdog	 that's what i'm using now, can't quite figure out how to enable the function i want
2009-03-29T06:03:00.000Z	Kevdog	blinkin_gremlin	Not sure what you want -- there is a cut and paste function
2009-03-29T06:03:00.000Z	blinkin_gremlin		to be clear, what i'm trying to replicate is PuTTY's ability to automatically copy to the clipboard what is hilighted (without shift+ctrl+c or some such)
2009-03-29T06:04:00.000Z	blinkin_gremlin	Kevdog	 Putty has the ability to automatically copy to the clipboard anything highlighted in the terminal window
2009-03-29T06:05:00.000Z	blinkin_gremlin	Kevdog	 it then pastes by a single right click
2009-03-29T06:05:00.000Z	Kevdog	blinkin_gremlin	Its like the cygwin terminal
2009-03-29T06:05:00.000Z	blinkin_gremlin	Kevdog	yes, i think that's correct
2009-03-29T06:05:00.000Z	Kevdog	blinkin_gremlin	Do you have a 2 or 3 button mouse
2009-03-29T06:05:00.000Z	blinkin_gremlin	Kevdog	(been awhile since I messed with Cygwin)
2009-03-29T06:06:00.000Z	blinkin_gremlin	Kevdog	any thoughts?
2009-03-29T06:06:00.000Z	Kevdog	blinkin_gremlin	side comment -- cygwin is great -- hence my lack of new info with putty since I havent used in a while
2009-03-29T06:06:00.000Z	Kevdog	blinkin_gremlin	What terminals have you tried?  2 or 3 button mouse?
2009-03-29T06:07:00.000Z	Kevdog	blinkin_gremlin	And which desktop or WM are we talking about?
2009-03-29T06:08:00.000Z	Kevdog		Ubontu is a stinkin bot!
2009-03-29T06:08:00.000Z	Kevdog		No need to thank a stupid bot!
2009-03-29T06:11:00.000Z	blinkin_gremlin	Kevdog	4 button mouse, GNOME on Ubuntu 8.04 (8.10 gives me initramfs errors), and I've tried Gnome Terminal most recently, and Xterm in the past
2009-03-29T06:11:00.000Z	blinkin_gremlin	Kevdog	 really haven't branched out as much on terminals as I have on other stuff (like script IDEs and such)
