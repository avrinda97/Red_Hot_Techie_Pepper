2009-04-07T14:47:00.000Z	Kimi	zigga15	 no NOT.. i want windows and ubuntu both together
2009-04-07T14:48:00.000Z	Kimi	zigga15	i just want to move this wubi into real ubuntu
2009-04-07T14:48:00.000Z	Kimi		by making a partition to ubuntu
2009-04-07T14:48:00.000Z	zigga15		yea
2009-04-07T14:48:00.000Z	zigga15		just put the ubuntu cd in so that you can sort it out
2009-04-07T14:48:00.000Z	zigga15		put the cd in reset your computer it shoud say: "press any key to boot from cd"
2009-04-07T14:48:00.000Z	zigga15		bootfrom theCD
2009-04-07T14:49:00.000Z	Kimi	zigga15	 NO..  am not getting "guided resize and used freed space" option.....
2009-04-07T14:49:00.000Z	zigga15		otherwise you will have to enter your bios
2009-04-07T14:49:00.000Z	Kimi	zigga15	 thats why i need to move wubi to its real ubuntu partition
2009-04-07T14:49:00.000Z	zigga15		you should if you have a bootable Ubuntu8.2 disk
2009-04-07T14:49:00.000Z	Kimi	zigga15	 ?
2009-04-07T14:49:00.000Z	zigga15		wubi isn't ubuntu
2009-04-07T14:50:00.000Z	Kimi	zigga15	 i WANT to move that wubi to its own paritition
2009-04-07T14:50:00.000Z	zigga15	Kimi	try download "Norton partition manager" and doing it from windows
