2005-07-05T11:39:00.000Z	dj-pynguin		QUESTION:  is there a way to boot into terminal from the LiveCD, cause i think there is actually an error with the user config for some reason on the PPC version
2005-07-05T11:39:00.000Z	dj-pynguin		I am having issues with the root password not being recognized
2005-07-05T11:40:00.000Z	bimberi	dj-pynguin	try your user password
2005-07-05T11:41:00.000Z	dj-pynguin	bimberi	no user password was set during configuration, just the option to create a regular account
2005-07-05T11:41:00.000Z	dj-pynguin	bimberi	and a root password, which seems not to work
2005-07-05T11:41:00.000Z	dj-pynguin	bimberi	is there a way to set my password right now for the user account w/o root access?
2005-07-05T11:46:00.000Z	bimberi	dj-pynguin	does sudo <command> work?
2005-07-05T11:47:00.000Z	dj-pynguin	bimberi	no, because when asked for the password:  if 'ubuntu' returns 'Sorry, Try again' else if '' brings me back to prompt, but <command> never executed
2005-07-05T11:49:00.000Z	dj-pynguin	bimberi	 any ideas or directions i should take?
2005-07-05T11:50:00.000Z	bimberi	dj-pynguin	just verifying that this is the livecd
2005-07-05T11:50:00.000Z	bimberi	dj-pynguin	sorry - badly framed.  Are you using the Live CD?
2005-07-05T11:52:00.000Z	dj-pynguin	bimberi	yes, im using the liveCD PPC edition
2005-07-05T11:52:00.000Z	dj-pynguin	bimberi	i need to recover data from my MacMini
2005-07-05T11:52:00.000Z	bimberi	dj-pynguin	does "su -" work - with the root password
2005-07-05T11:53:00.000Z	bimberi	dj-pynguin	(I think you said you've set one)
2005-07-05T11:53:00.000Z	dj-pynguin	bimberi	 YOU ARE A GODSEND!!!
2005-07-05T11:54:00.000Z	dj-pynguin	bimberi	 thanks so much for pointing out the obvious to me, now i feel dumb
2005-07-05T11:54:00.000Z	bimberi	dj-pynguin	Hallelujah - seems I've finally helped someone today
