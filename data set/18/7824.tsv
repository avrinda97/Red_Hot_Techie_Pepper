2007-11-16T13:54:00.000Z	gregorovius		I just tried to boot the realtime kernel, and after booting my computer becomes unresponsive, what can it be?
2007-11-16T13:54:00.000Z	gregorovius		I can switch ttys, and type my login name, but it doesn't even ask me for a password, and there's no HD activity at all
2007-11-16T13:55:00.000Z	gregorovius		heh, pipelineaudio is one of REAPER's greatest evangelists :)
2007-11-16T13:56:00.000Z	gregorovius		i'm using reaper on linux already ^^
2007-11-16T13:56:00.000Z	pipelineaudio	gregorovius	are you on ubuntu?
2007-11-16T13:56:00.000Z	gregorovius		yeah
2007-11-16T13:56:00.000Z	pipelineaudio		should I grab libjack 0.5? or 0.1 or what?
2007-11-16T13:56:00.000Z	gregorovius		to install wineasio, pipelineaudio?
2007-11-16T13:56:00.000Z	pipelineaudio		I think so
2007-11-16T13:57:00.000Z	pipelineaudio		Im just following dave's guide and grabbing whatever is newest
2007-11-16T13:57:00.000Z	gregorovius		0.5, I think, use the newest
2007-11-16T13:57:00.000Z	pipelineaudio		cool
2007-11-16T13:57:00.000Z	pipelineaudio		what soundcard are you using?
2007-11-16T13:58:00.000Z	pipelineaudio		can I just install regular windows asio drivers with wineasio? or am I SOL if theres not a linux driver for my card?
2007-11-16T13:58:00.000Z	gregorovius	pipelineaudio	you have to use linux native drivers for the sound card, which one do you have?
2007-11-16T13:59:00.000Z	pipelineaudio		the one thats on the laptop I use for demoing reaper is some sigmatel garbage, all it needs to do is play back, but I have this really cool line6 kb37 thing that I like to take with me
2007-11-16T13:59:00.000Z	pipelineaudio		but I can take a motu 8pre or 896 or traveller if need be
2007-11-16T14:01:00.000Z	gregorovius	pipelineaudio	don't know which ones are supported, I think the motus shoudl be
