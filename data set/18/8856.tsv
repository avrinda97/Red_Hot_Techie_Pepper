2007-06-19T06:09:00.000Z	unagi		ok i dont get it.....every tutorial that tells me to do the command make or make install i get the same error
2007-06-19T06:09:00.000Z	unagi		any reason why?
2007-06-19T06:09:00.000Z	nickrud	unagi	something about no gcc or the like?
2007-06-19T06:17:00.000Z	nickrud	unagi	if you installed that deb someone referred you to, dpkg -L <nameofdeb> | grep bin should show what you need to run
2007-07-08T07:27:00.000Z	nickrud	unagi	use csh /path/to/shake
2007-07-08T07:27:00.000Z	unagi	nickrud	thanks that worked
2007-07-08T08:35:00.000Z	nickrud	unagi	;)
2007-07-08T08:34:00.000Z	nickrud	unagi	does the maya site have a recommendation?
2007-07-08T08:48:00.000Z	nickrud	unagi	it's source, so neither. You'll learn gobs if you try it
2007-07-21T07:38:00.000Z	nickrud	unagi	mandrake should create it's own menu.lst, and maybe. It's not hard to add the stanzas if needed

2007-07-25T07:28:00.000Z	nickrud	unagi	the -o loop means option loopback, it tells the kernel it's a file to mount as a device (roughly)
2007-07-27T09:42:00.000Z	nickrud	unagi	it makes no difference
2007-07-27T09:42:00.000Z	nickrud	unagi	see the grub thing above? it talks about recoveringubuntuafterinstallingwindows
2008-01-14T00:06:00.000Z	nickrud	unagi	install nautilus-open-terminal
2008-01-14T00:08:00.000Z	nickrud	unagi	open the file manager, then select a folder and right click, you should see open terminal here
2008-01-14T00:08:00.000Z	nickrud	unagi	or open in terminal reather
2008-01-14T00:10:00.000Z	nickrud	unagi	if you don't see it, type   alt-f2 pkill nautilus , nautilus will restart and you should see it
