2010-12-27T10:48:00.000Z	Gilos		okay, I have a question, I installed the netbook edition of 10.10 and it's different, I think I can get used to it, but I would like a real applications drop down (sorta like a start menu) is there a way to enable or add this?
2010-12-27T10:49:00.000Z	clausen	Gilos	I ended up just using the ubuntu desktop edition...
2010-12-27T10:49:00.000Z	clausen	Gilos	you don't have to reinstall.  Just logout, and relogin, selecting "Ubuntu Desktop Edition" as your session type
2010-12-27T10:49:00.000Z	clausen	Gilos	I found it annoying that the netbook edition isn't very configurable
2010-12-27T10:50:00.000Z	Gilos	clausen	I chose the netbook because of my crappy resolution on this dell.  I like the icons on the side, but dang, they should have made that ubuntu symbol at the top the applications menu.
2010-12-27T10:51:00.000Z	clausen	Gilos	the desktop edition is quite configurable... you can drag the panel to the left side, etc.
2010-12-27T10:51:00.000Z	clausen	Gilos	(you have to unlock it first)
2010-12-27T10:51:00.000Z	clausen	Gilos	and you can increase the size of icons if you like
2010-12-27T10:52:00.000Z	clausen	Gilos	(you unlock things by right-clicking, and then clicking unlock)
2010-12-27T10:53:00.000Z	Gilos	clausen	I tried that, didn't like how the icons/tabs looked.  Maybe I should try something like docky on the side?
2010-12-27T10:54:00.000Z	clausen	Gilos	I'm surprised it looked bad... perhaps you need to make the size an even multiple of 12 to get it to look good?
2010-12-27T10:55:00.000Z	clausen	Gilos	(to get the icons to look good)
2010-12-27T10:55:00.000Z	Gilos		thor needlez :thanks, I will check that out.
2010-12-27T10:55:00.000Z	Gilos	clausen	just didn't like the text on the icons and having to make them too wide so they weren't truncated.
2010-12-27T10:56:00.000Z	clausen	Gilos	text?
2010-12-27T10:57:00.000Z	clausen	Gilos	you can have just the ubuntu menu, without "Applications, Places, System"
2010-12-27T10:57:00.000Z	Gilos		I just found a ubuntu based distro that I'm trying in virtual box to see if I like it.  Ultimate-Edition
2010-12-27T10:58:00.000Z	Gilos	clausen	I will try that out again, I haven't tried it in 10.10, I think it was 8.x that I last tried the icons on the side (before I try cario)
