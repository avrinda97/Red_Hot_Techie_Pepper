2005-01-07T11:00:00.000Z	Rene_S		So how is Hoary these days ?  Been a while since I tried it.
2005-01-07T11:00:00.000Z	crimsun	Rene_S	as bloody as ever
2005-01-07T11:01:00.000Z	crimsun	Rene_S	that's expected from a development branch :)
2005-01-07T11:02:00.000Z	Rene_S	crimsun	there isnt anything just out and out broken that I should be aware of is there ?
2005-01-07T11:03:00.000Z	crimsun	Rene_S	there is if you use Nvidia (or possibly ATI)'s binary-only packages for X Windows
2005-01-07T11:04:00.000Z	Rene_S	crimsun	well then I better just stop my 900 package upgrade while I am still ahead of the game hehe
2005-01-07T11:05:00.000Z	crimsun	Rene_S	why, do you use Nvidia or something?
2005-01-07T11:06:00.000Z	Rene_S	crimsun	Yeah I do, that would be a pretty big buzzkiller for me, couldn't play America's Army then
2005-01-07T11:07:00.000Z	crimsun	Rene_S	it's no big deal.
2005-01-07T11:07:00.000Z	crimsun	Rene_S	just be aware that the bug exists when you dist-upgrade to Hoary.
2005-01-07T11:08:00.000Z	crimsun	Rene_S	in the meantime, look at the workaround at https://bugzilla.ubuntu.com/show_bug.cgi?id=4937
2005-01-07T11:18:00.000Z	Rene_S	crimsun	oh yeah, thanks for the info btw, I think I am gonna hold off on busting my comp its the Holiday Season
2005-01-07T11:19:00.000Z	crimsun	Rene_S	don't worry, it's perfectly safe, just bloody.
2005-01-15T14:12:00.000Z	crimsun	Rene_S	it doesn't show up in the GNOME menu for me, either (running Hoary), but it does in the Debian menu
2005-01-15T14:15:00.000Z	Rene_S	crimsun	thanks for that but the Debian menu's are no solution, when it used to work previously plus the Debian menu's arent installed by default so If I were new that would annoy me
2005-01-15T14:15:00.000Z	crimsun	Rene_S	have you logged out and back in? I'm unsure whether Gxine uses the new xdg menu layout.
2005-01-17T14:06:00.000Z	crimsun	Rene_S	with what do you need assistance?
2005-01-19T11:50:00.000Z	crimsun	Rene_S	there are all sorts of interesting ways in which to break a Linux system
