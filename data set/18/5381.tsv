2009-01-22T15:54:00.000Z	kavitha		any one knows about enabling audio in plugin src
2009-01-22T15:56:00.000Z	kavitha		any one knows abt audio MIME type registration
2009-01-22T15:58:00.000Z	kavitha		no
2009-01-22T15:58:00.000Z	drash	kavitha	what are you looking for exactly ? adding/editing mime-type associations ?
2009-01-22T15:59:00.000Z	drash	kavitha	i find assogiate a very nice tool for that
2009-01-22T16:02:00.000Z	drash	kavitha	ok, assogiate is in the regular ubuntu repo's, so either install via synaptic or "sudo apt)get install assogiate"
2009-01-22T16:05:00.000Z	drash	kavitha	it's very straightforward .. it presents you with a categorzed list of all system/user registered mime-types and an editing pane :)
2009-01-22T16:07:00.000Z	drash	kavitha	ok goodluck with that
2009-01-22T16:09:00.000Z	drash	kavitha	you're welcome
2009-01-22T16:10:00.000Z	drash	kavitha	one note, if you need to change system mime-types, assogiate like any other GUI app will need to be started via "gksu", that bit me a few times ;)
2009-01-22T16:20:00.000Z	drash	kavitha	no, audio players need codecs for them to be able to play those mime-types
2009-01-22T16:21:00.000Z	drash	kavitha	what type of audio file are you trying to get to play in which player ?
2009-01-22T16:23:00.000Z	drash	kavitha	ok, and what player doesn't work right now for you with wav's ?
2009-01-22T16:24:00.000Z	drash	kavitha	ow i see, wav should be supported in all major browsers i guess
2009-01-22T16:27:00.000Z	drash	kavitha	might be wise to check the mplayer website and forums if you haven't already, can't help you on that sorry
2009-01-22T17:02:00.000Z	drash	kavitha	if you need wav support in firefox, install mozilla-mplayer package and restart your firefox
2009-01-22T17:06:00.000Z	kavitha	drash	i have installed mozilla-mplayer package, i can play mp4 files in firefox but in my dvrplayer application i can see only video
