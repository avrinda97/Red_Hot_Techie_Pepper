2010-05-27T23:30:00.000Z	ManDay_		what is the "document viewer"?
2010-05-27T23:32:00.000Z	ManDay_		What is the "document viewer" if evince is uninstalled?
2010-05-27T23:33:00.000Z	ManDay_		(not installed)
2010-05-27T23:34:00.000Z	crdlb	ManDay_	what are you expecting to happen?
2010-05-27T23:35:00.000Z	crdlb	ManDay_	what happens if you double-click on a pdf in nautilus?
2010-05-27T23:36:00.000Z	ManDay_	crdlb	well i edited my  ~/.local/applications - it uses xpdf
2010-05-27T23:37:00.000Z	crdlb	ManDay_	you did what? the normal way to set the pdf viewer is to right click on a pdf > properties > open with tab
2010-05-27T23:38:00.000Z	crdlb	ManDay_	mozilla has its own mime-type settings in its preferences, doesn't it?
2010-05-27T23:38:00.000Z	ManDay_	crdlb	it does and there I can set it
2010-05-27T23:39:00.000Z	crdlb	ManDay_	talk to the mozilla people, I guess
2010-05-27T23:40:00.000Z	ManDay_	crdlb	i dont think so. i think the "Default viewer" mystery is ubuntu caused
2010-05-27T23:40:00.000Z	ManDay_	crdlb	after all mozilla is not affiliated with evince - why would it do that crap?
2010-05-27T23:40:00.000Z	crdlb	ManDay_	nothing about the pdf viewer is hardcoded in ubuntu
2010-05-27T23:41:00.000Z	crdlb	ManDay_	I don't know anything about how firefox does it, but maybe they're just calling xdg-open
2010-05-27T23:41:00.000Z	ManDay_	crdlb	i wouldnt be so sure if I was you.... ubuntu has all kind of weird stuff
2010-05-27T23:42:00.000Z	ManDay_	crdlb	shouldnt xdg-open be the same in nautilus and mozilla?
2010-05-27T23:42:00.000Z	crdlb	ManDay_	try it
2010-05-27T23:42:00.000Z	ManDay_	crdlb	xdg-open uses xpdf
