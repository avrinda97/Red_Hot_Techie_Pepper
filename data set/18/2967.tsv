2011-02-27T13:52:00.000Z	MegaHerz		I need to create WIFI network via /etc/network/interfaces on 10.04. Is there a good guide on this?
2011-02-27T13:54:00.000Z	gaelfx	MegaHerz	why do you have to do it via that particular path?
2011-02-27T13:55:00.000Z	MegaHerz	gaelfx	for reasons ) can you help me?
2011-02-27T13:56:00.000Z	gaelfx	MegaHerz	not sure, but I'll try
2011-02-27T13:56:00.000Z	MegaHerz	gaelfx	just need to know what to type in the /etc/network/interfaces - how to setup key, ssid, and make my dhcp to work over it upon its start
2011-02-27T13:56:00.000Z	gaelfx	MegaHerz	did you check this out: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/WiFiHowTo ?
2011-02-27T13:57:00.000Z	MegaHerz	gaelfx	actually, I'm having the Internet via WiMax using a device with reverse engineered driver which doesn't like NM for some reasons. So I have to stop NM service every time I run the Internet
2011-02-27T13:57:00.000Z	MegaHerz	gaelfx	and now I just need to share my internet with a comrade laying near me in the hospital ))))
2011-02-27T13:58:00.000Z	MegaHerz	gaelfx	no, thanks for the link!
2011-02-27T13:58:00.000Z	gaelfx	MegaHerz	well, if you're connected via wireless, I'm not sure if you can create your own ad-hoc wireless network, but lemme do a little more digging
2011-02-27T13:58:00.000Z	gaelfx	MegaHerz	and np by the way
2011-02-27T14:00:00.000Z	gaelfx	MegaHerz	when you say WiMax, are you talking about 3g?
2011-02-27T14:03:00.000Z	MegaHerz	gaelfx	I don't know technical details but afaik WiMax is what a provider called "Yota" here in Moscow uses in his network and I thikn its more like WiFi, but fires on broader distances )
2011-02-27T14:04:00.000Z	gaelfx	MegaHerz	hm, well, if it's using your wireless card, I don't think you'll be able to make a wireless network with it and keep your connection

2011-02-27T14:06:00.000Z	gaelfx	MegaHerz	oh, it might be possible/easier if you have a wifi USB dongle so you can use one wireless device to connect to the internet and another to broadcast your adhoc network
2011-02-27T14:06:00.000Z	MegaHerz	gaelfx	no, I use a special device, plugged into usb
2011-02-27T14:06:00.000Z	MegaHerz	gaelfx	so they are different devices - one for the Internet, and another - for Wifi
