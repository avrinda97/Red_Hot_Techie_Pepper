2007-06-16T08:24:00.000Z	nivekc1		hey question.. i am currently running ubuntu 6.06 lts and thinking about upgrading to 7.04 is it worth it
2007-06-16T08:25:00.000Z	nivekc1		well it seemsver similar to me
2007-06-16T08:25:00.000Z	nivekc1		i am new to ubuntu

2007-06-16T08:26:00.000Z	nivekc1		but i am more into security.... i do some java programming and moslty web design
2007-06-16T08:27:00.000Z	PurpZeY	nivekc1	Word I hear is it's a worthwhile upgrade, but, it can be a pain
2007-06-16T08:27:00.000Z	PurpZeY	nivekc1	Then I'd do it.
2007-06-16T08:27:00.000Z	PurpZeY	nivekc1	Might as well, IMO.
2007-06-16T08:30:00.000Z	PurpZeY	nivekc1	I suspect there are a ton of differences, although I don't know what they are.
2007-06-16T08:34:00.000Z	PurpZeY	nivekc1	limit language....family channel...
2007-06-30T07:39:00.000Z	PurpZeY	nivekc1	That line is the real truth. . .All flavors do something a little different...Most of them are based on the same "meat" it's the flavoring that is different.....mostly.
2007-06-30T07:40:00.000Z	PurpZeY	nivekc1	It's in beta and not stable
2007-06-30T07:40:00.000Z	PurpZeY	nivekc1	I've seen AT LEAST 3 people come in and say they are having issues with it
