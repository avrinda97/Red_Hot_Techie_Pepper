2006-07-15T13:04:00.000Z	alnokta		anyone installed vhcs before?
2006-07-15T13:05:00.000Z	alnokta		good cause i am stuck
2006-07-15T13:06:00.000Z	dark^ngel	alnokta	there is an excellent installation script for vhcs2
2006-07-15T13:18:00.000Z	dark^ngel	alnokta	I don't see your paste
2006-07-15T13:21:00.000Z	dark^ngel	alnokta	what is your homepage.
2006-07-15T13:24:00.000Z	dark^ngel	alnokta	have you installed openssl
2006-07-15T13:27:00.000Z	dark^ngel	alnokta	it appears the script failed installing some component
2006-07-15T13:28:00.000Z	dark^ngel	alnokta	is this an addition to a relatively matured server?
2006-07-15T13:29:00.000Z	dark^ngel	alnokta	IOW: is this a server that has been built and added to for more than a week?
2006-07-15T13:29:00.000Z	dark^ngel	alnokta	remove the temporary directory and restart the install
2006-07-15T13:32:00.000Z	dark^ngel	alnokta	I'm not sure
2006-07-15T13:33:00.000Z	dark^ngel	alnokta	it should be in the same directory where you execute the vhcs2 script
2006-07-15T13:46:00.000Z	dark^ngel	alnokta	rm -rf disturbing_directory
2006-07-15T13:49:00.000Z	dark^ngel	alnokta	that's a safety valve so the fs doesn't poof
2006-07-15T13:55:00.000Z	dark^ngel	alnokta	you should upgrade
2006-07-15T13:55:00.000Z	dark^ngel	alnokta	quite possibly
2006-07-15T13:56:00.000Z	dark^ngel	alnokta	upgrade
2006-07-15T14:01:00.000Z	dark^ngel	alnokta	vhcs is really picky about versions
