2011-03-26T15:09:00.000Z	appi_uppi		hi, while reloading the synaptic packager i got this error message "Could not download all repository indexes". Just now i have installed ubuntu 10.04
2011-03-26T15:09:00.000Z	ikonia	appi_uppi	reload it, see if it happens again
2011-03-26T15:09:00.000Z	appi_uppi	ikonia	sure i will try now
2011-03-26T15:18:00.000Z	appi_uppi	ikonia	do i need to configure the URL in under software source, to get udpates from other source? If so please provide me some of the trusted urls
2011-03-26T15:18:00.000Z	ikonia	appi_uppi	did it fail a second time ?
2011-03-26T15:18:00.000Z	appi_uppi	ikonia	yes
2011-03-26T15:19:00.000Z	ikonia	appi_uppi	ok, open the software sources gui, and try one of the other mirrors, that one mirror maybe having a problem
2011-03-26T15:22:00.000Z	appi_uppi	ikonia	i got this error message "Failed to fetch http://in.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/lucid/Release.gpg  Could not connect to in.archive.ubuntu.com:80 (111.91.91.37). - connect (110: Connection timed out)
2011-03-26T15:22:00.000Z	ikonia	appi_uppi	yes, and I told you what to do
2011-03-26T15:22:00.000Z	appi_uppi	ikonia	I am not sure what do you mean by mirror
2011-03-26T15:23:00.000Z	ikonia	appi_uppi	in the software sources application, there is a list of available ubuntu repos mirrors, select a different one than the in.archive.ubuntu.com mirror
2011-03-26T15:24:00.000Z	appi_uppi	ikonia	sure, will try now
2011-03-26T15:24:00.000Z	ikonia	appi_uppi	I've just tried to connect to the in.archive.ubuntu.com mirror, and it appears to be down
2011-03-26T15:25:00.000Z	appi_uppi	ikonia	oh i see.
2011-03-26T15:28:00.000Z	appi_uppi	ikonia	its working fine :)
