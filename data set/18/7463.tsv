2008-01-12T09:38:00.000Z	WorkingOnWise		how can I install a package that has unmet dependencies? Make apt-get install it anyway?
2008-01-12T09:38:00.000Z	iN00DLE	WorkingOnWise	always on the edge I see
2008-01-12T09:38:00.000Z	WorkingOnWise	iN00DLE	lmao! hey there! U know it!
2008-01-12T09:39:00.000Z	iN00DLE		try and meet those dependencies would be my suggestion WorkingOnWise , is it a popular package or to bleeding edge?
2008-01-12T09:41:00.000Z	WorkingOnWise	iN00DLE	bleeding edge. Gnome-do the package it wants is actually there, but in hadry it is called something differant. I dont want to change the code if I can just give apt-get the command "apt-get install --because-I-am-smarter-than-you gnome-do"  :)
2008-01-12T09:43:00.000Z	WorkingOnWise		so is there a way to install a package without meeting the dependencies?
2008-01-12T09:44:00.000Z	iN00DLE		I don't recall the exact option, WorkingOnWise , --force or something
2008-01-12T09:45:00.000Z	WorkingOnWise	iN00DLE	I checked man apt-get and the only thing I found was --ignore-missing, which oddly enough, didnt work....
2008-01-12T09:47:00.000Z	iN00DLE	WorkingOnWise	what are you trying to install exactly?
2008-01-12T09:47:00.000Z	WorkingOnWise	iN00DLE	gnome-do
2008-01-12T09:47:00.000Z	WorkingOnWise	iN00DLE	the dependency problem is a known bug.
2008-01-12T09:48:00.000Z	iN00DLE	WorkingOnWise	do you have it as a deb pkg?
2008-01-12T09:49:00.000Z	WorkingOnWise	iN00DLE	it is a repository. apt-get wont download it because of the dep problem.
2008-01-12T09:51:00.000Z	iN00DLE		you *could* go to that repository via browser, nab pkg then force install via shotgun with gdebi
2008-01-12T09:51:00.000Z	iN00DLE		WorkingOnWise,
2008-01-12T09:53:00.000Z	WorkingOnWise	iN00DLE	i'm here....dogs needed me...
2008-01-12T09:54:00.000Z	iN00DLE		I don't know the answer so reask the question for others who may know WorkingOnWise , or download the file from the repository address via browser and force install with gdebi
2008-01-12T09:55:00.000Z	WorkingOnWise	iN00DLE	i didnt know gdebi could force an install....
