2009-08-08T15:10:00.000Z	AlexanderSupertr	cast	i get connection refused with tem
2009-08-08T15:11:00.000Z	cast	AlexanderSupertr	so ssh doesn't work, then
2009-08-08T15:12:00.000Z	AlexanderSupertr	cast	but i can use ssh -pport-no user@host
2009-08-08T15:12:00.000Z	AlexanderSupertr	cast	that works
2009-08-08T15:13:00.000Z	cast	AlexanderSupertr	-pport-no is not a ssh option.
2009-08-08T15:14:00.000Z	cast	AlexanderSupertr	is this your sshd?

2009-08-08T15:16:00.000Z	cast	AlexanderSupertr	why isn't it running on port 22?
2009-08-08T15:17:00.000Z	AlexanderSupertr	cast	is there a reason to conclude that?
2009-08-08T15:17:00.000Z	cast	AlexanderSupertr	anyway, see man scp and set scp to use whatever port it is you want
2009-08-08T15:22:00.000Z	AlexanderSupertr	cast	i checked /etc/services, ssh is on port 22 only
