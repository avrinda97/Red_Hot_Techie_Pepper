2005-09-28T10:31:00.000Z	minholi	Belutz	mon, first it conflicts with firefox package (the new package was named mozilla-firefox)
2005-09-28T10:32:00.000Z	Belutz	minholi	maybe you could remove it first, and re-install ?

2005-09-28T10:34:00.000Z	minholi	Belutz	and I already move my profile (.mozilla) to (.mozilla.bak)... the same think happens..
2005-09-28T10:36:00.000Z	Belutz	minholi	try this firefox -ProfileManager to run the profile manager and create a new one
2005-09-28T10:38:00.000Z	minholi	Belutz	it works on the first load, after the profile creation, and don't load up after close.
