2005-10-18T07:08:00.000Z	ivar		gah, this is a bad time to upgrade.. the repo is being hammered
2005-10-18T07:09:00.000Z	looga	ivar	then when is a good time to upgrade? 2 weeks from now?
2005-10-18T07:09:00.000Z	ivar	looga	i'd say so.. yeah
2005-10-18T07:09:00.000Z	looga	ivar	are you going to wait that long?
2005-10-18T07:09:00.000Z	ivar	looga	either that or get a cd via torrent
2005-10-18T07:10:00.000Z	looga	ivar	why not just  upgrade in the background?
2005-10-18T07:10:00.000Z	ivar	looga	no, i've already started .. my system would be hosed if I stopped now :|
2005-10-18T07:10:00.000Z	looga	ivar	i wish i could get a cd via torrent, but my pc doesn't burn cds.
2005-10-18T07:10:00.000Z	looga	ivar	what do you mean by "hosed"?
2005-10-18T07:11:00.000Z	ivar	looga	there are some major changes between breezy and warty... if half my packages are upgraded, the whole thing starts to stink
2005-10-18T07:11:00.000Z	looga	ivar	so no turning around now. for you and for me.
2005-10-18T07:11:00.000Z	ivar	looga	let's just hope it doesn't get /,'ed
2005-10-18T07:12:00.000Z	looga	ivar	if it does... what will happen.
2005-10-18T07:12:00.000Z	ivar	looga	the transfer speed will go down to nothing (or very close to it)
2005-10-18T07:14:00.000Z	ivar	looga	it's actually well supllied.. it doesn't make sense to make too many affordances for such anomalous traffic spikes (that's what bittorrent is for..)
2005-10-18T07:14:00.000Z	looga	ivar	if i could use bittorrent without having to burn the stuff on a CD, I would. But I don't have a CD burner, so i have no choice.
2005-10-18T07:15:00.000Z	ivar	looga	you can actually mount a CD image that's on your harddrive
2005-10-18T07:17:00.000Z	ivar	looga	with linux, you can do almost anything.. :)
