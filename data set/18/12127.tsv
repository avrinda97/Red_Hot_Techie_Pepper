2006-06-07T06:29:00.000Z	keithg		Well schucks.
2006-06-07T06:30:00.000Z	keithg		Anyone think they can give me some hard drive advice?
2006-06-07T06:30:00.000Z	nickrud	keithg	sure, get the best your money can afford :0
2006-06-07T06:31:00.000Z	nickrud	keithg	ah. Well, in for a penny, in for a pound. What's the issue then
2006-06-07T06:34:00.000Z	keithg	nickrud	Well, I have been working on fixing this for a while now.  It started one day when I tried to install dapper onto hda (I have my primary install on hdb) once it got to the formating stage, the installation froze at a certain percentage.  I eventually restarted the computer, and tried again, same problem.  Then I tried a breezy cd, again I get the same problem.  And then I try mke2fs -c -c /dev/hda and I get the same thing.
2006-06-07T06:35:00.000Z	nickrud	keithg	then I'd guess there's something wrong with the hard drive. I assume doing all this on another hard drive worked
2006-06-07T06:36:00.000Z	keithg	nickrud	Sorry for not specifying you're name at the beginning of that last one.
2006-06-07T06:37:00.000Z	nickrud	keithg	I saw it. Have you tried running cfdisk on hda and resetting the partitions? Not saying it's the fix, but it's what I'd do next
2006-06-07T06:37:00.000Z	keithg	nickrud	I sadly don't know much about fixing these sorts of things.  So I am learning this all as I go.  :)
2006-06-07T06:38:00.000Z	nickrud	keithg	is there anything at all on hda you want to save?
2006-06-07T06:38:00.000Z	keithg	nickrud	Nothing at all that's important.
2006-06-07T06:38:00.000Z	nickrud	keithg	run sudo cfdisk in a terminal, and re-partition the drive. Then, try the mk2fs command again
2006-06-07T06:39:00.000Z	nickrud	keithg	it'll kill a few minutes if nothing esle
2006-06-07T08:07:00.000Z	keithg	nickrud	Well, that wasn't able to fix my problems.  It did the same thing, I should have probably added that it sounds like the drive is restarting when it freezes.
2006-06-07T08:09:00.000Z	nickrud	keithg	when you say that you use the low level mkfs.ext3 tool, and it fails, that's a warning at my skill level about the disk itself. I may be wrong
2006-06-07T08:10:00.000Z	keithg	nickrud	So that would mean that I would need to replace it?
2006-06-07T08:11:00.000Z	nickrud	keithg	I just think that that should work, any distro. So, probably hard drive is a guess
2006-06-07T08:12:00.000Z	keithg	nickrud	Alright, thanks.  :)  I haven't had adequate life out of this drive.  It's fairly large as well.  :(
