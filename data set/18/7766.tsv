2007-12-26T04:36:00.000Z	intelikey		Glam when you get the busybox shell that you described, when trying to boot from hdd   either the root=  has the wrong address in your boot/grub/menu.lst  or you are not loading the propper drivers for the disk/partition/filesystem   it's one of the two.
2007-12-26T04:37:00.000Z	intelikey		Glam or do you mean that you get a shell without job control when booting the live CD ?
2007-12-26T04:39:00.000Z	intelikey		Glam bad burn on the iso... or unusual hardware and the kernel isn't finding the drive    is it a usb cd/dvd drive ?
2007-12-26T04:41:00.000Z	intelikey		Glam ok it's hardware related.   probably your lappy has real scsi and when ide-scsi emulation is turned on(which the live CD does) the resulting change in device addressing is confusing the kernel.   maybe check the forums for others that have had the same error.
2007-12-26T04:43:00.000Z	intelikey		Glam i wont try to walk you through a blind boot on that, because i'm not that familear with the unionfs and casper image that the live cd uses   hope there is an easy fix on the forums or someone else here knows on.
2007-12-26T04:43:00.000Z	intelikey		one
2007-12-26T04:45:00.000Z	intelikey		!de | zimon if you need language specific support...
2007-12-26T04:46:00.000Z	zimon	intelikey	.....
2007-12-26T04:47:00.000Z	intelikey	zimon	or if you are good help and speak the language.  they always appreciate more help.
2007-12-26T04:47:00.000Z	zimon	intelikey	i was just answering a question ..
2007-12-26T05:07:00.000Z	intelikey	zimon	if the module is loaded in the initramfs  then yes.   else no.
2007-12-26T05:09:00.000Z	zimon	intelikey	like alsa-drivers? the /dev/dsp and stuff must be created during boot, i guess that's done before the kernel is started
2007-12-26T05:09:00.000Z	intelikey	zimon	see above
2007-12-26T05:09:00.000Z	intelikey	zimon	short answer     no.
2007-12-26T05:11:00.000Z	zimon	intelikey	i read that ... but i don't know what's loaded in the initramfs ..
2007-12-26T05:11:00.000Z	intelikey	zimon	not the sound driver.
2007-12-26T05:11:00.000Z	zimon	intelikey	alright :-)
2007-12-26T05:12:00.000Z	intelikey	zimon	kernel frame buffering   disk and fs support   main board and chipset support     not in that order nessacerily
