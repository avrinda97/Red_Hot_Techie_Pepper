2011-08-09T04:13:00.000Z	PinkFreud		hey folks.  having a hell of a time with an ifupdown-configured wireless interface in natty.
2011-08-09T04:14:00.000Z	PinkFreud		my requirements are simple: connect to a wpa2 network using the configuration in /etc/network/interfaces for wlan0.  This worked wonderfully in debian squeeze.
2011-08-09T04:15:00.000Z	PinkFreud		in natty, wlan0 is brought up at boot.  it never bothers connecting to the network, though.
2011-08-09T04:16:00.000Z	PinkFreud		iw wlan0 scan shows me the network I want, but it's not associated.
2011-08-09T04:18:00.000Z	PinkFreud		it'd be awesome if it could do this *without* manual intervention, though.  :/
2011-08-09T04:18:00.000Z	edbian	PinkFreud	That's a simple script
2011-08-09T04:18:00.000Z	PinkFreud	edbian	sure is.  there's simple scripts behind ifupdown, too.
2011-08-09T04:19:00.000Z	PinkFreud	edbian	what I'd like to know is why do these not work?
2011-08-09T04:19:00.000Z	edbian	PinkFreud	I use Debian :)
2011-08-09T04:22:00.000Z	edbian	PinkFreud	indeed.  What does dmesg say about things?
2011-08-09T04:35:00.000Z	PinkFreud	edbian	now that I take a closer look at dmesg, it does reveal some rather strange goings-on
2011-08-09T04:36:00.000Z	PinkFreud	edbian	wlan0 is brought up, it finds the AP and associates, and then it disassocates (by local choice reason=3, which is 'WLAN_REASON_DEAUTH_LEAVING')
2011-08-09T04:58:00.000Z	edbian	PinkFreud	do it
2011-08-09T04:58:00.000Z	PinkFreud	edbian	before I do, any further ideas on what might be failing?
2011-08-09T04:59:00.000Z	edbian	PinkFreud	I have no clue.  I hate CLI wifi :P
2011-08-09T05:00:00.000Z	PinkFreud	edbian	beh.  I hate NM.
2011-08-09T05:00:00.000Z	edbian	PinkFreud	me too
2011-08-09T05:02:00.000Z	edbian	PinkFreud	:P
