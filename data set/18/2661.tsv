2011-02-13T20:06:00.000Z	z0mb1e_kgd		hi, need to change wireless driver from ath9k to ath5k for ar9285 chip in maverick, what should I do? have compat-wireless downloaded from the official ubuntu repo, but haven't found the config tool (like athload)
2011-02-13T20:07:00.000Z	z0mb1e_kgd		anybody?
2011-02-13T20:08:00.000Z	BluesKaj	z0mb1e_kgd	sudo modprobe ath5 ?
2011-02-13T20:10:00.000Z	BluesKaj	z0mb1e_kgd	run lsmod to see what modules are installed
2011-02-13T20:16:00.000Z	z0mb1e_kgd	BluesKaj	I have loaded the ath5k through modprobe as you said, lsmod shows ath5k at the very top of the list. How do I make it active?
2011-02-13T20:18:00.000Z	BluesKaj	z0mb1e_kgd	sudo dhclient, as long as you have nm-applet settings enabled
2011-02-13T20:20:00.000Z	z0mb1e_kgd	BluesKaj	done
2011-02-13T20:20:00.000Z	BluesKaj	z0mb1e_kgd	did it show a connection lease
2011-02-13T20:23:00.000Z	BluesKaj	z0mb1e_kgd	did you even choose thje wireless option in network manager ot is it one of those intels that uses ? wifi as eth0
2011-02-13T20:27:00.000Z	BluesKaj	z0mb1e_kgd	it looks like you're connected
2011-02-13T20:29:00.000Z	z0mb1e_kgd	BluesKaj	I am, but the nm-applet still shoes ath9k as the current wifi driver. should I reboot?
2011-02-13T20:30:00.000Z	BluesKaj	z0mb1e_kgd	I suppose , I'm not sure , as long as you can connect does it matter
2011-02-13T20:34:00.000Z	z0mb1e_kgd	BluesKaj	it does, as ath9k has difficulties with using aircrack, so I need to switch to ath5k that is said to have no problem
2011-02-13T20:35:00.000Z	BluesKaj	z0mb1e_kgd	did you reboot?
2011-02-13T20:38:00.000Z	z0mb1e_kgd	BluesKaj	nope, I will try now, but I am not sure it will work as I only added the ath5k module to the kernel, but did not specify it as the current wireless driver
2011-02-13T20:40:00.000Z	BluesKaj	z0mb1e_kgd	I'm not sure what you mean by specify it as current wifi driver ... it will probly show as such after a reboot
2011-02-13T20:47:00.000Z	BluesKaj	z0mb1e_kgd	so you have a connection with the ath9 module ?
2011-02-13T20:51:00.000Z	z0mb1e_kgd	BluesKaj	I have and I had it before. I just need to switch from one working wireless driver (ath9k, that has some issues with aircrack) to another one (ath5k, that is said to have none)
