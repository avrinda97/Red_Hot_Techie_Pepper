2007-06-12T16:33:00.000Z	Mr_Awesome		anyone know what to do if the install cd cant resize your partitions? i dont want to remove my windows partition
2007-06-12T16:34:00.000Z	Mr_Awesome		well, if i get rid of the windows drive, will it be possible to repartition the hdd and reinstall windows in a new partition at a later tim?
2007-06-12T16:35:00.000Z	Mr_Awesome		s/drive/partition
2007-06-12T16:35:00.000Z	Mr_Awesome		i see
2007-06-12T16:35:00.000Z	Mr_Awesome		well, the reason im installing linux is because i can no longer get windows to shut down cleanly
2007-06-12T16:35:00.000Z	Mr_Awesome		so, will it be possible to reinstall windows at a later time?
2007-06-12T05:11:00.000Z	Mr_Awesome		anyone know of somethin that would explain how to install windows alongside ubuntu?
2007-06-12T05:11:00.000Z	cables	Mr_Awesome	do you have windows currently, or Ubuntu?
2007-06-12T05:12:00.000Z	Mr_Awesome	cables	or would it be a lot easier to install windows first?
2007-06-12T05:12:00.000Z	cables	Mr_Awesome	way easier to do Windows first, since Ubuntu can then resize it and do the dual-boot
2007-06-12T05:13:00.000Z	cables	Mr_Awesome	if you want to do Ubuntu first though, you should resize your Ubuntu partitions with GParted (System>Administration>Gnome Partition Editor on the Ubuntu LiveCD) then fix Grub
2007-06-12T05:13:00.000Z	Mr_Awesome	cables	ok great. thanks
2007-06-12T05:13:00.000Z	Mr_Awesome	cables	is gparted on the alternate install cd though?
2007-06-12T05:14:00.000Z	cables	Mr_Awesome	no, you need a LiveCD.
2007-06-12T05:14:00.000Z	Mr_Awesome	cables	ok, thanks
2007-06-12T05:14:00.000Z	cables	Mr_Awesome	hold on a sec
2007-06-12T05:14:00.000Z	cables	Mr_Awesome	there's a 30 MB LiveCD with just GParted that you can download
2007-06-12T05:15:00.000Z	Mr_Awesome	cables	i know, i just found it ;)
