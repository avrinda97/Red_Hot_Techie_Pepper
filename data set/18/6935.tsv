2008-03-01T22:39:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	subsume	most of those excludes are not needed, that was my full backup command ...
2008-03-01T22:40:00.000Z	subsume	Jack_Sparrow	I wasn't getting that neat upgrade button in edubuntu 7.04
2008-03-01T22:41:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	subsume	You can follow the manual steps.. apt-get update apt-get upgrade and apt-get distro-upgrade.. check that last command for spelling on disrto..
2008-03-01T22:41:00.000Z	subsume	Jack_Sparrow	I'm more comfy with that anyway

2008-03-04T04:23:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	subsume	Look at the last respose in here and see if it helps with that "SImoulated" modem
2008-03-04T04:24:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	subsume	Those are not true modems.. there are soft-modems using the cpu to do the work...
