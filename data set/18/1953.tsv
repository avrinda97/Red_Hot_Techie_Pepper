2010-09-29T02:10:00.000Z	glebihan	cyberrider	po files are text files, so it shouldn't be an issue
2010-09-29T02:10:00.000Z	cyberrider	glebihan	I want to merge them automaticaly
2010-09-29T02:11:00.000Z	glebihan	cyberrider	automatically ? you mean with some command ?
2010-09-29T02:12:00.000Z	cyberrider	glebihan	i tryed msgmerge and msgcat and doesnt work
2010-09-29T02:12:00.000Z	glebihan	cyberrider	try the "paste" command
2010-09-29T02:14:00.000Z	cyberrider	glebihan	i dont think u get it. I have 2 po files (translations files) from 2 diferent versions of one program and  im trying to replace the translated lines from the older one in the newer one
2010-09-29T02:15:00.000Z	glebihan	cyberrider	oh ok you're right I didn't get that
2010-09-29T02:17:00.000Z	cyberrider	glebihan	so can I merge them without haveing the same text twice?
2010-09-29T02:18:00.000Z	glebihan	cyberrider	you may try using poEdit
2010-09-29T02:19:00.000Z	cyberrider	glebihan	from what I know so far in poedit I can just edit them I will check if it has some merge function somewhere
2010-09-29T02:20:00.000Z	glebihan	cyberrider	never used it but just read it has a merge function
2010-09-29T02:21:00.000Z	cyberrider	glebihan	I found a „update from POT” function I'll try it , thanks for your help
2010-09-29T02:22:00.000Z	glebihan	cyberrider	you're welcome
2010-09-29T02:24:00.000Z	cyberrider	glebihan	It worked, now i have updated the old file with new lines, and I didnt had to mess with copy paste
