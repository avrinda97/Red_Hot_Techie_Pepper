2010-07-10T06:03:00.000Z	steven		look at the file name
2010-07-10T06:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	steven	Where did you download this file?
2010-07-10T06:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	steven	Can you give a direct link so I can see what type of file it is exactly?
2010-07-10T06:07:00.000Z	Jordan_U	steven	22.4 meg, hurray for bloatwear!
2010-07-10T06:14:00.000Z	Jordan_U	steven	If you wait, I can give you a file which you will be able to just double click to install (if you don't mind waiting for another 22 meg download)
2010-07-10T06:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U	steven	Lexmark has done something really evil with this one, it's hard to tell how exactly to extract the actual .deb file from it (if there even is one)
2010-07-10T06:24:00.000Z	Jordan_U	steven	You don't need to run it with sudo though, so you can do it all with the GUI.
2010-07-10T06:25:00.000Z	Jordan_U	steven	First right click the file and choose properties.
2010-07-10T06:26:00.000Z	Jordan_U	steven	Actually, all you should need to do is double click the .deb.sh file and choose run in terminal.
2010-07-10T06:27:00.000Z	Jordan_U	steven	Enter your own password there.
2010-07-10T06:28:00.000Z	Jordan_U	steven	Everything possilbe to get wrong with a linux installer has been done with this one...
2010-07-10T06:36:00.000Z	Jordan_U	steven	I need to leave now but if you're willing to wait untill I get back in a few hours / tomorrow I think I can get this installer to behave.
