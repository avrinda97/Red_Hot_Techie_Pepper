2008-09-10T20:45:00.000Z	erUSUL	Aquahallic	just make the fstab entry noauto and mount it when needed and connected
2008-09-10T20:49:00.000Z	Aquahallic	erUSUL	if I set noauto then I have to actually go and still run the mount command right?
2008-09-10T20:49:00.000Z	erUSUL	Aquahallic	yep "sudo mount /mount/point"
