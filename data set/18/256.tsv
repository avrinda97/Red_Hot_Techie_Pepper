2012-05-19T02:05:00.000Z	juicebox	votproductions	what is the package called?
2012-05-19T02:06:00.000Z	votproductions	juicebox	I think it's something like gnome-fallback
2012-05-19T02:06:00.000Z	juicebox	votproductions	this is different than gnome-panel?
2012-05-19T02:07:00.000Z	votproductions	juicebox	gnome-session-fallback
2012-05-19T02:07:00.000Z	votproductions	juicebox	It is, fallback has Unity bits in (no Unity itself) and gnome-panel is GNOME 2 basically
2012-05-19T02:08:00.000Z	juicebox	votproductions	yeah, basically
2012-05-19T02:08:00.000Z	juicebox		then there is gnome-shell
2012-05-19T02:08:00.000Z	juicebox		which is a crack baby from unity and gnome
2012-05-19T02:08:00.000Z	votproductions	juicebox	Gnome-shell is the worst thing ever
