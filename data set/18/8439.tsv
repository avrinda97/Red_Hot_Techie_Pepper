2008-08-26T07:30:00.000Z	Bossmanbeta		Nautilus used to auto-refresh filesizes (as when files are downloaded, or mencoded), but it no longer auto-refreshes, would anyone know why?
2008-08-26T07:30:00.000Z	Bossmanbeta		...it also doesn't auto-refresh when new files appear...
2008-08-26T07:31:00.000Z	Gnea	Bossmanbeta	auto-refresh is working fine here... did you change anything?
2008-08-26T07:33:00.000Z	Gnea	Bossmanbeta	do you recall if you made any major system updates or changes?
2008-08-26T07:33:00.000Z	Gnea	Bossmanbeta	i'm looking into it
2008-08-26T07:35:00.000Z	Gnea	Bossmanbeta	well, it's an important issue. a lot of changes have been made in hardy and it's not something that i've seen before, but if there is an easy fix, we should at least make it easier for others to get the fix as well, don't you think?
2008-08-26T07:35:00.000Z	Gnea	Bossmanbeta	hrmmmmm.....
2008-08-26T07:37:00.000Z	Gnea	Bossmanbeta	does the problem only occur with your regular user account, or if you make a new user, does it happen with that account too?
2008-08-26T07:38:00.000Z	Gnea	Bossmanbeta	good idea..
2008-08-26T07:43:00.000Z	Gnea	Bossmanbeta	i can't remember if nautilus relies on fam in gutsy or not...
2008-08-26T07:44:00.000Z	Gnea	Bossmanbeta	right
2008-12-22T09:46:00.000Z	Bossmanbeta	Gnea	THose links unfortunately don't apply here. I've done what's recommended there, yet VLC doesn't find or recognize AAC encoder or MP3 encoder... Any ideas? The VLC channel is empty, the few there are not answering.
2008-12-22T09:47:00.000Z	Gnea	Bossmanbeta	perhaps I misunderstood what you were asking - are you trying to convert from one media format to another?
2008-12-22T09:52:00.000Z	Bossmanbeta	Gnea	yea, I have the codecs installed, becuase other apps seem to be able to use them (AVIdemux for example I have on the system and can convert just fine) -- I wanted to use VLC instead, but I keep getting the error that for MP3 audio: VLC could not find encoder "MPEG Audio layer 1/2/3". and for AAC: VLC could not find encoder "MPEG AAC Audio". I am betting that VLC is not configured properly to locate the codecs
2008-12-22T09:53:00.000Z	Bossmanbeta	Gnea	Also, Audacity can export to MP3 just fine as well, so I have the codecs installed on the system......
2008-12-22T09:53:00.000Z	Gnea	Bossmanbeta	more appropriately, VLC is not primarily an encoder, just a playback mechanism.  If Avidemux can do it, then stick with it.  Audacity goes great with it.
2008-12-22T09:55:00.000Z	Bossmanbeta	Gnea	Avidemux cannot handle the source properly, with AVI containers I get choppy video ... VLC seems to encode just fine... (it isn't primarily a playback mechanism, it has an extensive encoding capability via it's streaming to file or to live-stream) ... I can stream to other formats, but I am trying to specifically stream to file the audio track of movies files in MP3 or AAC audio for playback on a handheld that can only play back cer
2008-12-22T09:56:00.000Z	Bossmanbeta	Gnea	Do you know how to configure VLC where to locate/use the AAC codec (faac I think?) on the system or the LAME encoder?
