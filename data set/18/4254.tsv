2009-07-03T20:28:00.000Z	vsingh165	Halitech	yes
2009-07-03T20:28:00.000Z	vsingh165	Halitech	says "no firmware" next to it though...
2009-07-03T20:29:00.000Z	Halitech	vsingh165	do you have a wired connection so you can get the firmware?
2009-07-03T20:31:00.000Z	vsingh165	Halitech	ok im getting ndis write errors in my dmesg
2009-07-03T20:31:00.000Z	Halitech	vsingh165	thats probably the issue then ... are you doing them as sudo?
2009-07-03T20:32:00.000Z	vsingh165	Halitech	yes i always use ndiswrapper as sudo
2009-07-03T20:32:00.000Z	vsingh165	Halitech	does my user have to be part of a certain group?
2009-07-03T20:33:00.000Z	Halitech	vsingh165	just sudo or admin, can you do sudo apt-get update and have it work?
2009-07-03T20:33:00.000Z	vsingh165	Halitech	why would that work if the computer doesn't have internet
2009-07-03T20:34:00.000Z	vsingh165	Halitech	plus whenever i do modprobe it (with sudo of course) i get that "All config files need .conf" message
2009-07-03T20:34:00.000Z	Halitech	vsingh165	forgot you dont have a wired connection right now ... ok, try gksudo gedit /etc/fstab and see if it opens
