2007-01-21T08:31:00.000Z	yellow		i'll probably do that worse comes worse
2007-01-21T08:31:00.000Z	yellow		well now it's fine when i reset the keybaord layout

2007-01-21T08:32:00.000Z	yellow		haha for real ?
2007-01-21T08:32:00.000Z	yellow		ok i'll try another keyboard then
2007-01-21T08:33:00.000Z	atrus	yellow	you can remove the gnome keyboard settings by themselves. i can get you the command in a minute here.
2007-01-21T08:34:00.000Z	atrus	yellow	you could also see if it works in the "failsafe xterm" session.
2007-01-21T08:35:00.000Z	atrus	yellow	in gdm you select "sessions" on the login screen and select "failsafe xterm", or something similar.
2007-01-21T08:36:00.000Z	atrus	yellow	just logout/login.
2007-01-21T08:48:00.000Z	atrus	yellow	to reset just gnome's keyboard settings: gconftool --recursive-unset /desktop/gnome/peripherals/keyboard
2007-01-21T08:49:00.000Z	atrus	yellow	that's interesting, because it means X is probabbly configured right, but gnome is doing something silly. try the above command (ideally at the text console while logged out)
2007-01-21T08:50:00.000Z	atrus	yellow	tty == text console.
2007-01-21T08:55:00.000Z	atrus	yellow	"so i go to tty, log in, do gconftool .... to reset it ?" <- correct.
