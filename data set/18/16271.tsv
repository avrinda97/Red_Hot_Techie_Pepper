2004-11-17T17:37:00.000Z	mirak		matt ok ubuntu boot, then do a fsck and then try to run a getty, you know the consols, but it can't, it fails, so it's stuck. then if i try to do ctrl+alt+sup, it fails also
2004-11-17T17:38:00.000Z	mirak		becquse it can't find /sbin/reboot

2004-11-17T17:40:00.000Z	mjg59	mirak	What do you mean by a getty? A text login or a graphical one?
2004-11-17T17:40:00.000Z	mjg59		And in what way does it fail to launch them?
2004-11-17T17:40:00.000Z	mirak	mjg59	a console text
