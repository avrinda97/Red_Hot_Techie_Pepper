2010-02-22T07:18:00.000Z	soreau	madjoe	It even gives you instruction on how to install that..
2010-02-22T07:18:00.000Z	madjoe	soreau	I know.. I did all the steps with no luck
2010-02-22T07:19:00.000Z	madjoe	soreau	I did all the steps with no "human" errors
2010-02-22T07:20:00.000Z	soreau	madjoe	I don't see any reason why it wouldn't work, thoguh I haven't tried it
2010-02-22T07:21:00.000Z	madjoe	soreau	can you try it if you have ubuntu 9.10, please?
2010-02-22T07:23:00.000Z	soreau	madjoe	I can't try it right now, but maybe later
2010-02-22T07:23:00.000Z	madjoe	soreau	thanx
2010-03-24T16:47:00.000Z	soreau	madjoe	It should be the default when you set it there. If it's resetting itself, you may have permissions problems in .gconf
2010-03-24T16:48:00.000Z	madjoe	soreau	.gconf in my home folder?
2010-03-24T16:49:00.000Z	soreau	madjoe	yea
2010-03-24T16:50:00.000Z	madjoe	soreau	I've checke it... no, permissions are fine
2010-03-24T16:50:00.000Z	madjoe	soreau	I'm using compiz
2010-03-24T16:50:00.000Z	soreau	madjoe	To fix it, you could try as you normal user, run 'sudo chown -R $USER ~/.gconf*' then set to None and back to Normal again then re-login. If it doesn't work, this is not your problem :)
2010-03-24T16:51:00.000Z	madjoe	soreau	chown is set to my username for all directories and files
2010-03-24T16:52:00.000Z	soreau	madjoe	I guess it's broken somewhere else then
2010-03-24T16:52:00.000Z	madjoe	soreau	hm.. ok
