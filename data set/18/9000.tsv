2007-05-26T12:44:00.000Z	enry		mmm in my laptop the boot-bar start immediatly to process
2007-05-26T12:45:00.000Z	sahil_	enry	what boot bar exactly are you talking about?
2007-05-26T12:46:00.000Z	enry	sahil_	 the orange one
2007-05-26T12:46:00.000Z	sahil_	enry	at what stage, is it the one where it says ubuntu on top?
2007-05-26T12:46:00.000Z	enry	sahil_	 i think yes
2007-05-26T12:47:00.000Z	sahil_		on my laptop it also takes about 20 seconds, that is normal (and its way faster than windows)
2007-05-26T12:47:00.000Z	enry	sahil_	 20 second of nothing!!!!
2007-05-26T12:48:00.000Z	sahil_	enry	now that makes a lot more sense
2007-05-26T12:48:00.000Z	enry	sahil_	 you don't understand 20 second of nothing than it start to process
2007-05-26T12:49:00.000Z	sahil_		check  you menu.lst file in boot/grub directory
2007-05-26T12:50:00.000Z	enry	sahil_	 it's not a Grub problem
2007-05-26T12:50:00.000Z	sahil_	enry	now i understand what you where saying. First I thought you meant it was takeing 20 seconds
2007-05-26T12:50:00.000Z	sahil_		enry,then check your session and see what is running
2007-05-26T12:51:00.000Z	enry	sahil_	 my boot process takes 23 second plus 20 seconds of booring whait
2007-05-26T12:51:00.000Z	sahil_	enry	i know what u mean
