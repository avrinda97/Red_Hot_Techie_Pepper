2010-02-14T07:45:00.000Z	michal_		i have a problem w/ my comp booting from extr drive instead of internal drive
2010-02-14T07:46:00.000Z	collabra	michal_	: check your computer's bios,... change your boot order
2010-02-14T07:46:00.000Z	michal_	collabra	its set w/ internal first
2010-02-14T07:47:00.000Z	collabra	michal_	: are you sure,.... if you are then, are you sure you have an os on your internal drive?
2010-02-14T07:47:00.000Z	michal_	collabra	the external usb drive is on the very buttom...lol. yes i have a os :)
2010-02-14T07:48:00.000Z	michal_	collabra	its only on bootup. i have to unplug it before it goes to grub and then its all fine
2010-02-14T07:49:00.000Z	collabra	michal_	: lol,... i'm not sure then,... i'd double check my bios,... there is no reason your computer should only boot to the external. try getting rid of your external boot option in your bios all together.
2010-02-14T07:50:00.000Z	michal_	collabra	how do i go about doing that? it doesnt seem to have that option
2010-02-14T07:51:00.000Z	collabra	michal_	on every computer,... while it's booting up,... it gives you options,... on some is the DEL key on other F10 on other F12,.... press whatever button gets you into your bios and change your boot order
2010-02-14T07:52:00.000Z	collabra	michal_	: careful while your in there though,....
2010-02-14T07:52:00.000Z	michal_		collabr: i understad that i mean is how do i completly remove that option?
2010-02-14T07:53:00.000Z	michal_	collabra	my other comp works fine its only on this compaq
2010-02-14T07:53:00.000Z	collabra	michal_	ah,.. that depends on the bios,... most allow you to change or delete boot up options
2010-02-14T07:54:00.000Z	michal_	collabra	like i said i can change the order but not remove the device...also can i see the bios after i bootup(inside hperterminnal)
2010-02-14T07:55:00.000Z	collabra	michal_	and changing the boot order doesn't solve your problem?
2010-02-14T07:55:00.000Z	michal_	collabra	nah
2010-02-14T07:56:00.000Z	collabra	michal_	: that's strange,... i'd take a second look,... sorry i couldn't help you
2010-02-14T07:56:00.000Z	michal_	collabra	no prob thax
