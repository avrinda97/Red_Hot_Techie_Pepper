2006-01-17T06:31:00.000Z	nalioth	devwal	you're welcome to discuss Texas and civics (and civets) in #ubuntu-offtopic
2006-01-17T06:31:00.000Z	devwal	nalioth	was kidding, im done
2006-01-19T16:28:00.000Z	nalioth	devwal	you'll need to do this  >> "sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop"
2006-01-19T16:44:00.000Z	nalioth	devwal	that is your refresh rate
2006-01-19T16:44:00.000Z	devwal	nalioth	Is there an easy fix?
2006-01-19T16:45:00.000Z	nalioth	devwal	fix your refresh rate to match your display?
2006-01-19T16:46:00.000Z	devwal	nalioth	is that in xfree-config?
2006-01-19T16:46:00.000Z	nalioth	devwal	nope. we don't use xfree86. run in a console "sudo dkpg-reconfigure xserver-xorg"
