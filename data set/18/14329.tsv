2008-01-07T23:34:00.000Z	Carlosh	nickrud	just one more question. How i make metacity run at start of each session of that user?
2008-01-07T23:35:00.000Z	nickrud	Carlosh	that metacity --replace should have made it permanent ...  Log out and in to test
2008-01-07T23:35:00.000Z	Carlosh	nickrud	just done that. When I log on again the same thing happens. :\
2008-01-07T23:36:00.000Z	nickrud	Carlosh	hm, that sounds like a bug. Try another new user
2008-01-07T23:39:00.000Z	Carlosh	nickrud	same thing with new user. :\
2008-01-07T23:40:00.000Z	nickrud	Carlosh	hm. Thinking... maybe productively
2008-01-07T23:41:00.000Z	Carlosh	nickrud	> I have time. There's no rush.. ;)
2008-01-07T23:45:00.000Z	Carlosh	nickrud	> what do You think of idea adding that command to startup of that user's session?
2008-01-07T23:45:00.000Z	nickrud	Carlosh	it would be a hack, but should work. I haven't really looked at how the default window manager system works recently, I just know it's not the way I learned a while back
2008-01-07T23:47:00.000Z	Carlosh	nickrud	nah, I wouldn't like to do that kind of
2008-01-07T23:48:00.000Z	nickrud	Carlosh	hack is not a perjorative , it's a way of saying workaround
2008-01-07T23:48:00.000Z	Carlosh	nickrud	> I understood that, but you know, I love everything working as it should. I don't like doing 'dirty' workarounds.. Some kind of light perfectionism. :D
2008-01-07T23:49:00.000Z	nickrud	Carlosh	point to you ;)
2008-01-07T23:52:00.000Z	Carlosh	nickrud	> I'll try a system restart. Will come back, You won't get rid of me ;)
2008-01-07T23:53:00.000Z	nickrud	Carlosh	but you will lose me in a few minutes. I see other people around who know more than I do, you might want to repost your problem.
2008-01-08T00:01:00.000Z	Carlosh	nickrud	> found something. At the other user under System > Preferences > Sessions > Current Session there is no metacity at all. And at my main user it is there.. So question is how I add metacity command to that user's session and how should it look?
2008-01-08T00:02:00.000Z	nickrud	Carlosh	when you do metacity --replace, it should show in the sessions, with a restart status
2008-01-08T00:02:00.000Z	nickrud	Carlosh	gotta go, good luck
