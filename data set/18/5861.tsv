2008-08-24T07:39:00.000Z	pajamian		heh, I got the wrong language?
2008-08-24T07:39:00.000Z	carandraug	pajamian	yes. I'm portugues as well ;)
2008-08-24T07:39:00.000Z	pajamian	carandraug	it looked like spanish to me, but they do look similar when you don't know either.
2008-08-24T07:41:00.000Z	carandraug	pajamian	you're right. For one reason we're neighbors. Portuguese and spanish can understand each other quite well by default
2008-08-24T09:27:00.000Z	pajamian	carandraug	have you tried the alternate install CD?
2008-08-24T09:28:00.000Z	carandraug	pajamian	I'm asking him. He's in this channel but doesn't know english and can't find support on the portuguese channel
2008-08-24T09:30:00.000Z	carandraug	pajamian	no, he hasn't tried it. But he already started the download some time ago and will soon try it. But do you have any idea of what can be wrong by looking at the error? It complains about modprobe. Also, the notebook is new
2008-08-24T09:31:00.000Z	pajamian	carandraug	not off the top of my head, no.  But the alternate install CD does work in a lot of instances where the live CD doesn't.  It's always the first thing I try.
2008-08-24T09:31:00.000Z	carandraug	pajamian	ok. He'll try it anyway and then he'll know. Also, he managed to install debian on it with no problem
2008-08-24T09:32:00.000Z	pajamian	carandraug	notebook being new could mean that there's new hardware in it that the live CD doesn't directly support yet.
2008-08-24T09:32:00.000Z	carandraug	pajamian	I see. Makes sense. Thanks a lot
2008-08-24T09:32:00.000Z	pajamian	carandraug	yw
2008-08-24T09:36:00.000Z	pajamian	carandraug	I take it KennedyNoia is the one you were helping?
2008-08-24T09:36:00.000Z	carandraug	pajamian	yes he was. Thanks a lot
2008-08-24T09:36:00.000Z	pajamian	carandraug	yw
2008-08-24T09:36:00.000Z	carandraug	pajamian	he can read english ok but his english is not so good
2008-08-24T09:37:00.000Z	pajamian	carandraug	yep, that makes sense.
