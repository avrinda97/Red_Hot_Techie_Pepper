2010-06-20T21:38:00.000Z	K-rAd-	unop	might you point me to a guide that would allow a ubuntu user to host their own "godaddy" webserver on their ubuntu desktop ?
2010-06-20T21:49:00.000Z	unop	K-rAd-	so you have a domain from godaddy and you'd like to host a webserver for that domain on your home PC?
2010-06-20T21:50:00.000Z	K-rAd-	unop	yes basically that is something i'd be open to doing
2010-06-20T21:50:00.000Z	unop	K-rAd-	do you have a static or dynamic address at home?
2010-06-20T21:50:00.000Z	K-rAd-	unop	a guide would be great i realize you probably could not explain all the steps here
2010-06-20T21:51:00.000Z	K-rAd-	unop	it is static, though it has a lease time for renewal
2010-06-20T21:51:00.000Z	unop	K-rAd-	and on renewal, do you get the same address?
2010-06-20T21:51:00.000Z	K-rAd-	unop	no however that doesn't happen too often
2010-06-20T21:52:00.000Z	K-rAd-	unop	i realize you can't help me here, but if you know of a guide to do what i hope to accomplish, that'd be spiffy
2010-06-20T21:53:00.000Z	unop	K-rAd-	well, something like this - http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=632841
2010-06-20T21:55:00.000Z	unop	K-rAd-	setting up apache is quite easy, the hard part is using some sort of dynamic dns service (dyndns, zoneedit, etc) to map domain name to IP address and vice versa.
2010-06-20T21:58:00.000Z	K-rAd-	unop	might you know of a free dns service that would be sufficient for personal web server application
2010-06-20T21:59:00.000Z	K-rAd-	unop	and godaddy, unless you know if a better domain registrant
2010-06-20T22:00:00.000Z	unop	K-rAd-	the domain registrar can be anything. I would use zonedit as the DNS service unless I setup a DNS server at home - but a static IP address is required.
2010-06-20T22:01:00.000Z	K-rAd-	unop	you would not setup a apache web server from home ?
2010-06-20T22:31:00.000Z	unop	K-rAd-	If i setup a webserver at home, it would serve a low load. Plus it's against my ISP's ToS to do so. I'd rather pay for a VPS and be guaranteed good bandwidth and availability.
2010-06-20T22:33:00.000Z	K-rAd-	unop	what does VPS stand for ?
2010-06-20T22:34:00.000Z	unop	K-rAd-	Virtual Private Server. see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server
