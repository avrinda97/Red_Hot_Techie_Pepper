2008-05-12T03:39:00.000Z	sparr__		aptitude wants to remove hundreds of packages that apt-get doesnt.  how can i convince it not to?
2008-05-12T03:40:00.000Z	evilgnome	sparr__	is this when trying to uninstall packags?
2008-05-12T03:41:00.000Z	sparr__	evilgnome	no, when trying to dist-upgrade
2008-05-12T03:42:00.000Z	evilgnome	sparr__	try sudo aptitude afe-upgrade
2008-05-12T03:42:00.000Z	evilgnome		*safe-upgrade
2008-05-12T03:46:00.000Z	sparr__	evilgnome	that doesnt seem to change the behavior of dist-upgrade
2008-05-12T03:52:00.000Z	evilgnome	sparr__	why are you using dist-upgrade instead of safe-upgrade?
2008-05-12T03:53:00.000Z	sparr__	evilgnome	because i want some of those abandoned packages to be uninstalled
2008-05-12T03:53:00.000Z	evilgnome		but only some?
2008-05-12T03:53:00.000Z	evilgnome		what is it removing that you don't want it to?
2008-05-12T03:54:00.000Z	sparr__	evilgnome	i dont want it to remove lots of applications.  i do want it to remove libraries not in use by anything.
2008-05-12T03:55:00.000Z	evilgnome	sparr__	lots of _specific_ applications?
2008-05-12T03:55:00.000Z	evilgnome	sparr__	you could install them directly
2008-05-12T03:56:00.000Z	sparr__	evilgnome	i dread having to go through the list and pick out applications i definitely want to keep
2008-05-12T03:56:00.000Z	evilgnome	sparr__	is this an update from a previous ubuntu version?
2008-05-12T03:56:00.000Z	sparr__	evilgnome	no
2008-05-12T03:57:00.000Z	sparr__	evilgnome	hardy post-release to hardy today
2008-05-12T04:00:00.000Z	evilgnome	sparr__	I don't know what to tell you. I don't know what packages you would be losing (or why). for me, full-upgrade doesn't want to remove anything.
