2011-09-23T23:22:00.000Z	larno	ActionParsnip	nothing, no screens found
2011-09-23T23:30:00.000Z	larno	ActionParsnip	should I try to install newest nvidia driver?
2011-09-23T23:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	larno	all i can suggest is tweak xorg.conf   you may also want to read:   less /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2011-09-23T23:32:00.000Z	larno	ActionParsnip	but xorg.cong has nothing to do with it. it clearly says No screens found. the same thing happens when I try to manually load the nvidia driver
2011-09-23T23:33:00.000Z	larno	ActionParsnip	it doesn't recognize my card
2011-09-23T23:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	larno	the xorg.conf defines the display and the screens so has everything to do with it
2011-09-23T23:34:00.000Z	larno	ActionParsnip	it is already defined to load the nvidia driver
2011-09-23T23:34:00.000Z	larno	ActionParsnip	but it says no screens found which means that my device is not recognized as nvidia card
2011-09-23T23:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	larno	then its not quite right or it would work, hence me saying to tweak it
2011-09-23T23:35:00.000Z	larno	ActionParsnip	you can't tweak the xorg.conf to recognize something if the driver doesn't support it
2011-09-23T23:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	larno	if there isn't the settings the driver needs to run then it won't load and therefore, no screens
2011-09-23T23:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	larno	oh jeez is it one of those dual gpu monstrosities?
2011-09-23T23:38:00.000Z	larno	ActionParsnip	SIFTU: so the only way to activate nvidia is via bumblebee or the other iron something?
2011-09-23T23:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	larno	the
2011-09-23T23:41:00.000Z	larno	ActionParsnip	??
2011-09-23T23:42:00.000Z	larno	ActionParsnip	sorry didn't know that
