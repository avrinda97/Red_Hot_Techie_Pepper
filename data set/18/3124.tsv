2009-12-09T05:54:00.000Z	jrib	sim13sime	start by being less vague :)
2009-12-09T05:59:00.000Z	jrib	sim13sime	changed the mount point how?
2009-12-09T06:01:00.000Z	sim13sime	jrib	i was playing around with it to get the hang of using mount and umount commands and i changes it from /media to /mnt/flash a folder i created
2009-12-09T06:01:00.000Z	jrib	sim13sime	unmount it everywhere then mount it to one place
2009-12-09T06:02:00.000Z	sim13sime	jrib	i did and the flash drive is clean but the 2 folders are stuck on my Desktop
2009-12-09T06:02:00.000Z	jrib	sim13sime	are the folders empty?
2009-12-09T06:03:00.000Z	sim13sime	jrib	i cant do anything with them bc its telling me they dont exist
2009-12-09T06:03:00.000Z	jrib	sim13sime	do they exist when you do "ls ~/Desktop"?
2009-12-09T06:04:00.000Z	sim13sime	jrib	nope and neither does ls -a
2009-12-09T06:04:00.000Z	jrib	sim13sime	click on your desktop and trying pressing f5 or ctrl-r
