2009-10-25T05:48:00.000Z	TuTUXG	mo0nykit	non
2009-10-25T05:49:00.000Z	mo0nykit	TuTUXG	you mean there aren't any?
2009-10-25T05:51:00.000Z	TuTUXG	mo0nykit	you have to have skype running in able to use it's api
2009-10-25T05:52:00.000Z	mo0nykit	TuTUXG	and mojo_o: then i'll get skype for linux then :)
2009-10-25T05:52:00.000Z	TuTUXG	mo0nykit	skype is proprietary.
2009-10-25T05:53:00.000Z	mo0nykit	TuTUXG	i wouldn't mind :)
2009-10-25T05:54:00.000Z	TuTUXG	mo0nykit	i know, im just saying that becuz it's limited the freedom to develop a good alternative
2009-10-25T05:56:00.000Z	mo0nykit	TuTUXG	yeah, that's right. I didn't see your point at first.
2009-10-25T05:58:00.000Z	TuTUXG	mo0nykit	there's a beta version, also a stable one
2009-10-25T05:59:00.000Z	TuTUXG	mo0nykit	2.0 is stable
2009-10-25T05:59:00.000Z	mo0nykit	TuTUXG	where do I get a stable one? from medibuntu?
2009-10-25T05:00:00.000Z	mo0nykit	TuTUXG	thanks, i have just finished updating to medibuntu repos
2009-10-25T05:01:00.000Z	TuTUXG	mo0nykit	actually the beta one seems works better with a/v conferences
2009-10-25T05:03:00.000Z	mo0nykit	TuTUXG	oh, haha! to beta or not to beta? hehe.. it's my sister who wants to use it, and she's the type who calls the resident tech support (me) when problems crop up :P
2009-10-25T05:04:00.000Z	TuTUXG	mo0nykit	let's say i have used it since karmic alpha 4, now it's rc and it never has problems, i mean, once you set it up right
2009-10-25T05:05:00.000Z	TuTUXG	mo0nykit	by "it" i refer to skype 2.1 beta
2009-10-25T05:05:00.000Z	mo0nykit	TuTUXG	if you say the beta has a/v conferences, and i presume that might be the only major difference, i think i'll get the one from the medibuntu repos
