2007-08-15T16:30:00.000Z	marshcast		I'm having graphics issues. I think it could be that my 'ati' drivers are damaged (either that or I'm not configuring the monitor correctly) - could anyone suggest a way to find out which it is? I'm running feisty with a Radeon Xpress 200
2007-08-15T16:30:00.000Z	scguy318	marshcast	wut kind of issues
2007-08-15T16:30:00.000Z	scguy318	marshcast	and ATI drivers are like DRM: defective-by-design :P
2007-08-15T16:31:00.000Z	scguy318	marshcast	video corruption? using restricted?
2007-08-15T16:31:00.000Z	marshcast	scguy318	I had open source drivers - these are ok but I lose user switching (which is important in this m/c.
2007-08-15T16:33:00.000Z	scguy318	marshcast	what do you mean u lose user switching?
2007-08-15T16:33:00.000Z	marshcast	scguy318	installed restricted - no user switching at all - using ati (default) user switching shows the desktop but no action,  using vesa vid corruption. ati worked before - but then it all fell apart.
2007-08-15T16:34:00.000Z	marshcast	scguy318	user switvhing - ati: desktop but lose mouse, flgrx: black screen on user switch, vesa switching good - bad graphics.

2007-08-15T05:04:00.000Z	marshcast	scguy318	Theimon Envy's sorted it - I was up till 4am trying to sort that and you's guys have pointed me fantastically - thankyuothankyouthankyou ;)  - is the "we dont support these drivers 'cause they're restricted anything to worry about? would I be wise to take out all the repo's except security ones for upgrades?
2007-08-15T05:04:00.000Z	scguy318	marshcast	kinda overkill lol
2007-08-15T05:04:00.000Z	scguy318	marshcast	the restricted == proprietary
