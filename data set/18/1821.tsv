2010-10-29T09:40:00.000Z	Gideongreene		i was wondering if anyone can offer some assistance to me, im completely green with anything linux and was in the process of downloading and installing linux on to a laptop and after booting up with the disk i got an error (initramfs) mount: mounting /dev/loop0 on //filesystem.squashfs failed Input/output error can not mount /dev/loop0 (/cdrom/casper/filesystem.squashfs) on //filrsystem.squashfs --- anyone know why this error me
2010-10-29T09:42:00.000Z	coz_	Gideongreene	 you are trying to run the live cd ?
2010-10-29T09:43:00.000Z	Gideongreene	coz_	yeah i downloaded it off the ubuntu website and burned the image to a disk
2010-10-29T09:44:00.000Z	coz_	Gideongreene	 ok when you insert and boot from the cd  is there a point you see a small "keyboard" image at the bottom of the screen?
2010-10-29T09:44:00.000Z	Gideongreene	coz_	yes
2010-10-29T09:45:00.000Z	coz_	Gideongreene	  when you see that... hit enter  and a menu should appear   with several options you should run... the first is    check file integrity  or  check cd for errors
2010-10-29T09:47:00.000Z	coz_	Gideongreene	 if you do get errors from the cd check... you will have to re download  the iso image   and burn it at 1x  if possible  eliminating most of the possible  burn issues at higher speeds
2010-10-29T09:48:00.000Z	coz_	Gideongreene	 there is an alterntive..
2010-10-29T09:48:00.000Z	coz_	Gideongreene	  you can download and burn the minimal install cd
2010-10-29T09:48:00.000Z	coz_	Gideongreene	  this pulls all files from the server as it installs  eliminating download errors..however it is NOT  alive cd
2010-10-29T09:49:00.000Z	coz_	Gideongreene	 if you just want to test it then the livd cd is the way to go...if you want to actually install it then I would go with the minimal install
2010-10-29T09:49:00.000Z	coz_	Gideongreene	 it is not  "minimal"  in that you dont get everything...it is minimal because it is only a  meg  iso
2010-10-29T09:50:00.000Z	coz_	Gideongreene	  rather only a 12  meg  iso
2010-10-29T09:50:00.000Z	coz_	Gideongreene	 let me get the link hold on
2010-10-29T09:50:00.000Z	coz_	Gideongreene	  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD
2010-10-29T09:51:00.000Z	coz_	Gideongreene	 one thing to keep in mind when you start this... at one point you will get a list of things to install...you scroll the list with the arrow buttons and choose one  with the "Spacebar"  not enter
2010-10-29T09:51:00.000Z	coz_	Gideongreene	  I would go with the regular  ubuntu-desktop
2010-10-29T09:52:00.000Z	coz_	Gideongreene	 no problem...by the way... I only use the minimal install cd  here
