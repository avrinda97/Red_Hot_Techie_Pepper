2009-10-04T06:30:00.000Z	lstarnes	Guest96	please provide us with more specific information.  What sound card are you using?
2009-10-04T06:32:00.000Z	lstarnes	Guest96	try running this in a terminal: sudo modprobe snd-hda-intel
2009-10-04T06:32:00.000Z	lstarnes	Guest96	now see if you get any sound
2009-10-04T06:33:00.000Z	lstarnes	Guest96	modprobe usually says nothing when it works
2009-10-04T06:34:00.000Z	lstarnes	Guest96	there is also https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshooting
2009-10-04T06:36:00.000Z	lstarnes	Guest96	is there an unlock button of some sort?
2009-10-04T06:38:00.000Z	lstarnes	Guest96	I'm not sure
2009-10-04T06:38:00.000Z	lstarnes	Guest96	if you were able to use sudo, then that should work
2009-10-04T06:41:00.000Z	lstarnes	Guest96	I knowq
2009-10-04T06:41:00.000Z	lstarnes	Guest96	you told me this
2009-10-04T06:41:00.000Z	lstarnes	Guest96	and you did not get an error message from the sudo command that I told you to run earlier
2009-10-04T06:41:00.000Z	lstarnes	Guest96	I usually see things even if I don't respond
2009-10-04T06:42:00.000Z	lstarnes	Guest96	I'm not sure how to fix it
2009-10-04T06:44:00.000Z	lstarnes	Guest96	you most likely don't have to reinstakk
2009-10-04T06:45:00.000Z	lstarnes	Guest96	try this: go to System > Preferences > Sound and select PulseAudio Sound Server in all of the droboxes except the last one
2009-10-04T06:47:00.000Z	lstarnes	Guest96	sudo dpkg -i filename.deb
2009-10-04T06:49:00.000Z	lstarnes	Guest96	sorry, that was for Guest15155
