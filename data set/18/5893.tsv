2009-09-09T18:58:00.000Z	EF_Codd		I got a Asus 1000HE netbook. I didn't think it would be, but it's the best computer I've bought lol
2009-09-09T18:58:00.000Z	EF_Codd		i hardly use my "real" laptop anymore
2009-09-09T18:59:00.000Z	rabidweezle	EF_Codd	You should see my Compaq cq60-215dx :) Nvidia 8200M G, plays enemy territory Quake Wars quite well
2009-09-09T18:59:00.000Z	EF_Codd	rabidweezle	well, I have a gaming rig to play games
2009-09-09T19:01:00.000Z	EF_Codd	rabidweezle	I don't bother with wine. I just dual boot
2009-09-09T19:02:00.000Z	rabidweezle	EF_Codd	yeah, it's not stable enough for a coding enviroment unless you are like me and just use notepad++ :D
2009-09-09T19:03:00.000Z	EF_Codd	rabidweezle	vim ftw
2009-09-09T19:04:00.000Z	rabidweezle	EF_Codd	Vim isn't bad, but notepad++ is a dream at finding errors
2009-09-09T19:04:00.000Z	EF_Codd	rabidweezle	little hard to use via ssh :)
2009-09-09T19:04:00.000Z	rabidweezle	EF_Codd	true
2009-09-09T19:04:00.000Z	rabidweezle	EF_Codd	then again, I don't do my coding from ssh
2009-09-09T19:05:00.000Z	rabidweezle	EF_Codd	said it grawity, not me
2009-09-09T19:06:00.000Z	EF_Codd	rabidweezle	I use it all the time
2009-09-09T19:07:00.000Z	rabidweezle	EF_Codd	Like if I'm coding, I code on my laptop, then commit the changes via ftp
2009-09-09T19:08:00.000Z	EF_Codd	rabidweezle	heh my coding can be anything from C++ to Haskell to Java to lisp on any day
2009-09-09T19:09:00.000Z	rabidweezle	EF_Codd	All I code in is C# .net
2009-09-09T19:09:00.000Z	EF_Codd	rabidweezle	ah ....
2009-09-09T19:11:00.000Z	EF_Codd	rabidweezle	at least you didn't say you coded in VB.Net
