2010-03-13T08:28:00.000Z	Xarver		doesn't work, only the earbuds.
2010-03-13T08:28:00.000Z	Emanon	Xarver	need to switch output port
2010-03-13T08:29:00.000Z	Emanon		i dont think so Prestidigitonium just recommended for performance
2010-03-13T08:29:00.000Z	Emanon		but you may be right
2010-03-13T08:29:00.000Z	Xarver	Emanon	?
2010-03-13T08:29:00.000Z	Emanon		you could try to make it force a ramdisk for swap

2010-03-13T08:30:00.000Z	Emanon	Xarver	what i meant is it seems when you unplug it doesnt switch back to your speakers so you may need to manually switch the output
2010-03-13T08:32:00.000Z	Xarver	Emanon	How do I do that?
2010-03-13T08:32:00.000Z	Emanon		right click on the volume control in system tray
2010-03-13T08:32:00.000Z	Emanon		click sound preferences
2010-03-13T08:33:00.000Z	Emanon		hit output tab
2010-03-13T08:33:00.000Z	Emanon		and fiddle till it works
2010-03-13T08:34:00.000Z	Xarver	Emanon	there are much settings...
2010-03-13T08:34:00.000Z	Emanon		doesnt seem so Grogyan
2010-03-13T08:35:00.000Z	Emanon	Xarver	try the radial buttons or the dropdown menu at the bottom of the output tab
2010-03-13T08:36:00.000Z	Xarver	Emanon	there's only one radio button and no settings work
