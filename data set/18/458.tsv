2012-06-11T09:31:00.000Z	dontknow	javierf_	"gets the low performance again" do you mean it gets  literally "ondemand" or "powersave"
2012-06-11T09:34:00.000Z	javierf_	dontknow	in CPU freq it stays in performance mode, but everything goes slow and I have the feeling is not using the CPU the situation requires (program runs slow, no fun, no warming...)
2012-06-11T09:36:00.000Z	dontknow	javierf_	"watch grep \"cpu MHz\" /proc/cpuinfo" you can use this command to see realtime cpu frequency,
2012-06-11T09:38:00.000Z	javierf_	dontknow	I'm afraid I don't understand the output really well. I get four cpus with 1199.00
2012-06-11T09:39:00.000Z	javierf_	dontknow	well, i see now if I change cpu freq indicator i indeed change the output of that command and works properly
2012-06-11T09:40:00.000Z	javierf_	dontknow	but it still surprise me that I start playing a game and have normal speed and then it start getting slowly, but doesnt feel it's using all cpu available (no fan, no heat...)
2012-06-11T09:42:00.000Z	dontknow	javierf_	maybe there is a issue with indicator lol use that comman istead of indicator "sudo cpufreq-set -g performance"
2012-06-11T09:42:00.000Z	dontknow	javierf_	that command set all cores performance
2012-06-11T09:43:00.000Z	javierf_		you mean, I  use "sudo cpufreq-set -g performance" to set all cores to performance?
2012-06-11T09:44:00.000Z	dontknow	javierf_	yes
2012-06-11T09:44:00.000Z	javierf_	dontknow	but it doesnt work, says "cpufrq-set" order not found
2012-06-11T09:46:00.000Z	dontknow	javierf_	install "sudo apt-get install cpufrequtils"
2012-06-11T09:46:00.000Z	dontknow	javierf_	and use the command that i gave
2012-06-11T09:55:00.000Z	dontknow	javierf_	did you make it?
2012-06-11T09:59:00.000Z	dontknow		anyone here have ati hd2400 or hd3x series card?
2012-06-11T09:59:00.000Z	javierf_	dontknow	yes, I did it and was trying it. I think it worked, although I'm not totally sure. I'll have to see in the next days if it's really done
2012-06-11T09:59:00.000Z	javierf_	dontknow	thanks a lot!
2012-06-11T10:00:00.000Z	dontknow	javierf_	you are wellcome
