2008-02-27T07:48:00.000Z	ice109		 go?
2008-02-27T07:49:00.000Z	prince_jammys	ice109	try :::  find /usr -iname *mathematica*
2008-02-27T07:50:00.000Z	ice109	prince_jammys	case sensitive?
2008-02-27T07:50:00.000Z	prince_jammys	ice109	-iname is case insensitive
2008-02-27T07:51:00.000Z	prince_jammys	ice109	"find" is the powerful find command
2008-02-27T07:51:00.000Z	ice109	prince_jammys	what does /usr and -iname do?
2008-02-27T07:52:00.000Z	prince_jammys	ice109	searches within /usr recursively , -iname searches case insensitive
2008-02-27T07:52:00.000Z	ice109	prince_jammys	so if i want to search the entire directory tree how do i do that?
2008-02-27T07:52:00.000Z	prince_jammys	ice109	sudo find / -iname *mathematica*
2008-02-27T07:53:00.000Z	prince_jammys	ice109	with *
2008-02-27T07:54:00.000Z	prince_jammys	ice109	will match mathematica-12 mathematica-blah..   if you don't use * you will only match a file named "mathematica" and no other
2008-02-27T07:55:00.000Z	prince_jammys	ice109	/usr/local
2008-02-27T07:55:00.000Z	prince_jammys	ice109	or /opt, some people use
