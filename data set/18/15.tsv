2005-01-27T11:16:00.000Z	robhu		I tried the things listed in the bug report - but it still doesn't work :0(
2005-01-27T11:16:00.000Z	robhu		Should I just wait until the developers fix it? How long is that likely to take?
2005-01-27T11:18:00.000Z	robhu		"no process killed"
2005-01-27T11:19:00.000Z	robhu		mmkay
2005-01-27T11:21:00.000Z	robhu		OK that didn't help - in gnome-failsafe it does the same thing, and killall gnome-panel just says "no such process" again :(
2005-01-27T11:22:00.000Z	jdub	robhu	no, that won't help you.
2005-01-27T11:22:00.000Z	jdub	robhu	explain what you mean by 'b0rked'? what actually happens?
2005-01-27T11:24:00.000Z	jdub	robhu	log out, jump to a console, delete ~/.gnome2/session
2005-01-27T11:24:00.000Z	jdub	robhu	then kill off all your processes and log in again
2005-01-27T11:25:00.000Z	jdub	robhu	stay logged in, jump to a console - is there a gnome-panel process running?
2005-01-27T11:26:00.000Z	robhu	jdub	Nope
2005-01-27T11:27:00.000Z	robhu	jdub	If I do a locate for gnome-panel it doesnt find anything but schemas etc... should there not be an actual gnome-panel binary somewhere?
2005-01-27T11:28:00.000Z	jdub	robhu	which gnome-panel
2005-01-27T11:29:00.000Z	jdub	robhu	type "which gnome-panel"
2005-01-27T11:30:00.000Z	robhu	jdub	it didnt print anything
2005-01-27T11:30:00.000Z	jdub	robhu	that's a problem
2005-01-27T11:30:00.000Z	jdub	robhu	install ubuntu-desktop
2005-01-27T11:31:00.000Z	jdub	robhu	um, dude, come on... sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
