2009-01-10T17:12:00.000Z	ziroday	Gnea	SiDi pulse and flash can work nicely in hardy with the libflashsupport package
2009-01-10T17:13:00.000Z	Gnea	ziroday	but if pulse isn't setup properly to begin with (and it's not in Ubuntu) then what's the point of it being user-friendly?
2009-01-10T17:13:00.000Z	ziroday	Gnea	how its setup and if it was rushed is a different story
