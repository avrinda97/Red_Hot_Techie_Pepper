2005-03-23T08:22:00.000Z	navreet		hi, can anyone help me boot ubuntu?
2005-03-23T08:22:00.000Z	heze	navreet	what seems to be the problem
2005-03-23T08:25:00.000Z	navreet	heze	it's so sad that I've experience LOTS of linux/X lockups and only 1 XP lock.  linux stability seems to be a myth
2005-03-23T08:25:00.000Z	heze	navreet	it's more about how much experience you have with the environment.
2005-03-23T08:38:00.000Z	heze	navreet	kernel lacks the driver for your root's filesystem?
2005-03-23T08:39:00.000Z	navreet	heze	no, I doubt it... I've booted it before (just don't remember how)
2005-03-23T08:44:00.000Z	heze	navreet	lemme guess: VFS: unable to mount root partition =)
2005-03-23T09:22:00.000Z	heze	navreet	> as in with size? =)
2005-03-23T09:22:00.000Z	navreet	heze	as in version number
2005-03-23T09:22:00.000Z	navreet	heze	or a later release date
2005-03-23T09:22:00.000Z	heze	navreet	warty is stabe, hoary is development version afaik
2005-03-23T09:22:00.000Z	navreet	heze	ah
2005-03-23T09:23:00.000Z	navreet	heze	so warty=stable
2005-03-23T09:23:00.000Z	navreet	heze	err warty=stable like warty=woody
2005-03-23T09:26:00.000Z	heze	navreet	http://ubuntuguide.org has nice tricks :)
2005-03-23T09:27:00.000Z	heze	navreet	who said that and where? :)
2005-03-23T09:27:00.000Z	navreet	heze	isn't that supposed to be ubuntu's philosophy
2005-03-23T09:28:00.000Z	heze	navreet	i don't believe that's possible with any linux distribution. not yet. maybe in a couple of years.
