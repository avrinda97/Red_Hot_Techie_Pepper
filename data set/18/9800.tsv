2007-02-20T17:12:00.000Z	Proghead	hyperactivecrond	I've get plenty of stuff when writing dmesg | grep hd (mainly because that my cddrive appear confused), and my slave hd is listed

2007-02-20T17:18:00.000Z	Proghead	hyperactivecrond	I enter my password and it wrote nothing, so should it have worked? I don't see it more but maybe Im searching at the wrong place, since I've installed Ubuntu today hehe
