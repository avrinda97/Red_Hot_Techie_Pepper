2008-05-04T01:50:00.000Z	HELLOF		If I have 2 harddrives (main (os's, application), child (mp3 files, video, installers for safekeeping)), is it possible to view the files from child using linux and windows on a dual boot machine?
2008-05-04T01:50:00.000Z	HELLOF		*linux or windows, rather
2008-05-04T01:51:00.000Z	HELLOF		Ok zChris, now to put a twist on it.. how would i make a 'fake' child drive using only one harddrive?
2008-05-04T01:51:00.000Z	HELLOF		because i'd rather do that than burn like 10 discs
2008-05-04T01:53:00.000Z	HELLOF		ok
2008-05-04T01:55:00.000Z	HELLOF		so, it's possible to make a separate partition on a harddrive that doesn't have an OS on it, only pure data? if so, that would be very great
2008-05-04T01:55:00.000Z	HELLOF		i wouldn't need to burn all my files to disc when i reformat my os then!
2008-05-04T01:55:00.000Z	HELLOF		YES!
2008-05-04T01:55:00.000Z	moveax	HELLOF	I'd suggest a second HDD in the PC
2008-05-04T01:56:00.000Z	HELLOF	moveax	don't have one.. if i did, this would be trivial
2008-05-04T01:56:00.000Z	moveax	HELLOF	And just mount it when you're in Linux. Ubuntu will do this automatically.
2008-05-04T01:56:00.000Z	moveax	HELLOF	In that case, modify the LVM and mount your /home on a seperate partition.
2008-05-04T01:58:00.000Z	moveax	HELLOF	Why not BUY a second HDD?
2008-05-04T01:59:00.000Z	moveax	HELLOF	probably
2008-05-04T01:59:00.000Z	moveax	HELLOF	Like, just get a 80gB for downloads and media and junk
2008-05-04T01:59:00.000Z	moveax	HELLOF	do you cook all your meals on a camp fire? no, you use the oven or microwave, because they make your life easier.
2008-05-04T02:00:00.000Z	moveax	HELLOF	Buy a second HDD and do the job correctly.
2008-05-04T02:00:00.000Z	HELLOF	moveax	good point
