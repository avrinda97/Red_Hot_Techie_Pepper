2006-01-11T17:45:00.000Z	_null	TTilus	but my backup has had about 50'000 files each ~3kbyte big ;)
2006-01-11T17:40:00.000Z	TTilus	_null	maybe you are trying to copy file bigger than 42% of your volume
2006-01-11T17:40:00.000Z	_null	TTilus	no, a touch /media/foobar says no space left
2006-01-11T17:40:00.000Z	_null	TTilus	/dev/md2              297G  171G  127G  58% /media
2006-01-11T17:43:00.000Z	_null	TTilus	got it, the blocksize was 4 mbyte, so each little file (and I have a lot of small files) consumed 4 mbytes :p
2006-01-11T17:44:00.000Z	TTilus	_null	mygod! 4mb blocks, why?
2006-01-11T17:44:00.000Z	_null	TTilus	because normally every file is about 50 mbyte big
2006-01-11T17:50:00.000Z	TTilus	_null	it sounds like better performance to me
2006-01-11T17:50:00.000Z	_null	TTilus	true with the cost of data security :p
2006-01-11T17:50:00.000Z	TTilus	_null	and im not all that picky about loosing current recording
2006-01-11T17:50:00.000Z	_null	TTilus	if you got an usv, then no problem ;)
2006-01-11T17:51:00.000Z	TTilus	_null	mm, heavy caching means heavy mem usage and the box doesnt have very much of that
2006-01-11T17:52:00.000Z	TTilus	_null	what is usv?
2006-01-11T17:53:00.000Z	_null	TTilus	uninteruptable power supply, in fact a battery that keeps your computer running if there's a power loss
2006-01-11T17:53:00.000Z	_null	TTilus	i say usv because i speak german ;)
2006-01-11T17:53:00.000Z	TTilus	_null	o, im used to calling it ups
2006-01-11T17:53:00.000Z	_null	TTilus	yes of corse, forgot that :p
2006-01-11T17:53:00.000Z	TTilus	_null	i still dont say kvl even if im a finn  :)
