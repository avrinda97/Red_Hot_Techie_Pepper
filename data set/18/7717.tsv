2007-11-29T02:31:00.000Z	shenron		how do I tell if this laptop has bluetooth? Its an Acer Aspire 5520 and the Acer site says I have bluetooth, but the circuitcity site (where I bought it) says no. Neither say it was optional. Also, there is a bluetooth button on the keyboard (that doens't work) that the manual says is for bluetooth
2007-11-29T02:32:00.000Z	shenron		setting up bluetooth isn't a problem -_- I have a usb bluetooth thing, and that works fine
2007-11-29T02:32:00.000Z	shenron		I like that idea jalompuhr but it'd void warrenty :p
2007-11-29T02:33:00.000Z	shenron		actually mystamax, thats a great idea
2007-11-29T02:34:00.000Z	shenron		Oh, before I reboot and check my bios, I have another problem where I have to reinstall my nvidia driver everytime I reboot the computer
2007-11-29T02:34:00.000Z	shenron		It happens on a couple of my computers
2007-11-29T02:34:00.000Z	shenron		I cannot just modprobe nvidia or dpkg-reconfigure, I have to reinstall it everytime
2007-11-29T02:35:00.000Z	bmod	shenron	are you reinstalling the nvidia drivers?
2007-11-29T02:36:00.000Z	bmod	shenron	ok i have the same problem
2007-11-29T02:36:00.000Z	bmod	shenron	i'm going to check what happens with the xorg.conf at boot time, so i'll be back in a minute
2007-11-29T02:46:00.000Z	bmod	shenron	xorg.conf seems to be the same
2007-11-29T02:47:00.000Z	shenron	bmod	ya I know
2007-11-29T02:47:00.000Z	bmod	shenron	so now i'm confuse
2007-11-29T02:48:00.000Z	shenron	bmod	I solved the problem by rarely ever shutting down my computer :p
2007-11-29T02:48:00.000Z	bmod	shenron	and you had that problem since 7.10 right?
2007-11-29T02:48:00.000Z	bmod	shenron	oh and what about our environment? ;)
2007-11-29T02:48:00.000Z	bmod	shenron	also in feisty? hmm that worked fine here
2007-11-29T02:49:00.000Z	bmod	shenron	what card is the other one?
