2010-07-11T01:41:00.000Z	sharplinux	Petertatt	can you boot into Ubuntu while staying on Windows?
2010-07-11T01:41:00.000Z	sharplinux	Petertatt	(might save the trouble)
2010-07-11T01:42:00.000Z	sharplinux	Petertatt	I mean, can you boot up your computer and use it alongside your girlfriend's?
2010-07-11T01:45:00.000Z	sharplinux	Petertatt	it would help for you to be on Ubuntu while in channel... can you try booting into it and using xchat or Chatzilla (Firefox addon)?

2010-07-11T01:51:00.000Z	sharplinux	Petertatt	all apps in the software center will run on your system
2010-07-11T01:52:00.000Z	sharplinux	Petertatt	no, but there are tens of thousands, just a click away
2010-07-11T01:53:00.000Z	sharplinux	Petertatt	if you need something specific that's not in there, sometimes you have to download from "the open web"
