2010-06-11T02:33:00.000Z	kinks		it did take some getting used to, but I don't think I would be able to use anything else now.
2010-06-11T02:33:00.000Z	kinks		I do not feel as if I have any lack of control.
2010-06-11T02:33:00.000Z	kinks		there are some applications that do not display all that well with ion3, but there are not many that I use.
2010-06-11T02:35:00.000Z	kinks		dialog boxes generally stretch the entire width of the screen, but it doesn't do any harm.
2010-06-11T02:35:00.000Z	kinks		you *can* have floating windows if you want to.
2010-06-11T02:35:00.000Z	kinks		I very rarely do.
2010-06-11T02:37:00.000Z	kinks		I generally use it for terminal 'stuff' and sometimes writing code.
2010-06-11T02:39:00.000Z	kinks		but that isn't really specific to ion3.. it just becomes all that much more useful on ion3.
2010-06-11T02:39:00.000Z	kinks		I feel that I can navigate from one application to the next much more quickly.
2010-06-11T02:40:00.000Z	kinks		I see.
2010-06-11T02:40:00.000Z	gwern	kinks	ion3? is ubuntu even allowed to package that?
2010-06-11T02:40:00.000Z	kinks	gwern	indeed
2010-06-11T02:40:00.000Z	kinks	gwern	ubuntu isn't really among the distros that there was a problem with.. I believe it was mostly arch linux.
2010-06-11T02:41:00.000Z	gwern	kinks	oh, that must be a fork from before tuomov went insane
2010-06-11T02:41:00.000Z	kinks	gwern	that could be.. but I don't think so.
2010-06-11T02:41:00.000Z	gwern	kinks	I was sure tuomov had decided to start charging or something for ion
2010-06-11T02:41:00.000Z	kinks	gwern	I'm pretty sure I still have to accept a disclaimer that hands my soul over to tuomov :p
2010-06-11T02:42:00.000Z	gwern	kinks	you might try xmonad too</plug>
