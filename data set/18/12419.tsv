2006-08-01T12:53:00.000Z	gorgeousjunkie		tritium I am
2006-08-01T12:53:00.000Z	gorgeousjunkie		warbo I went to the java page
2006-08-01T12:53:00.000Z	Warbo	gorgeousjunkie	Don't install the sun-java5-doc package, since that needs some extra setting up
2006-08-01T12:55:00.000Z	Warbo	gorgeousjunkie	What I am saying is, install the package sun-java5-bin, but not the sun-java5-doc, unless you want to go through a little bit of extra work, just to get the documentation
2006-08-01T12:56:00.000Z	Warbo	gorgeousjunkie	"sudo aptitude install sun-java5-jre"
2006-08-01T12:58:00.000Z	Warbo	gorgeousjunkie	Then do what I originally said, and install sun-java5-bin
2006-08-01T13:00:00.000Z	Warbo	gorgeousjunkie	If it went through "setting up sun-java5-bin" and stuff then yes
2006-08-01T13:02:00.000Z	Warbo	gorgeousjunkie	Can you paste the single line from "sudo dpkg -l | grep java5-bin" please
2006-08-01T13:06:00.000Z	Warbo	gorgeousjunkie	OK, can you pastebin the file /etc/apt/sources.list, cos it looks like you might not have multiverse
2006-08-01T13:10:00.000Z	Warbo	gorgeousjunkie	That's weird. The only thing I can think of is that ie.archive.ubuntu.com might not have the right package. Try running "gksudo gedit /etc/apt/sources.list" then adding a line "deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ dapper main restricted universe multiverse", saving, updating Apt, then trying again
2006-08-01T13:14:00.000Z	Warbo	gorgeousjunkie	Go into Syanptic and install sun-java5-bin from there, it is easier :)
2006-08-01T13:19:00.000Z	Warbo	gorgeousjunkie	I am really wondering why they are not installable. Your sources look fine
2006-08-01T13:19:00.000Z	Warbo	gorgeousjunkie	Are you running Edgy by any chance?
2006-08-01T13:20:00.000Z	Warbo	gorgeousjunkie	Your sources are for Dapper. If you don't know what edgy is then you are probably not running it
2006-08-01T13:21:00.000Z	Warbo	gorgeousjunkie	Try pointing your browser to http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/multiverse/s/sun-java5/sun-java5-bin_1.5.0-06-1_i386.deb
