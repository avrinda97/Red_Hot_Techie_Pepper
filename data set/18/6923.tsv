2008-03-03T01:44:00.000Z	danand	x89xx	- ^^
2008-03-03T01:45:00.000Z	danand	x89xx	- you need to type "asoundconf list" without the qoutes
2008-03-03T01:46:00.000Z	danand	x89xx	- see what that says.
2008-03-03T01:46:00.000Z	x89xx	danand	: i havent put any quotes
2008-03-03T01:46:00.000Z	x89xx	danand	:  I jut wrote asoundconf
2008-03-03T01:48:00.000Z	danand	x89xx	- no :] - you need to add the word list to the end of that - ie type "asoundconf list" as the complete command
2008-03-03T01:48:00.000Z	x89xx	danand	: same its gives the two names
2008-03-03T01:49:00.000Z	danand	x89xx	 - what are the exact names
2008-03-03T01:50:00.000Z	danand	x89xx	- when you ran the command asoundconf set-default-card etc did you type Live at the end ie exactly like this - asoundconf set-default-card Live   ??
2008-03-03T01:52:00.000Z	x89xx	danand	: Holy shit dude. Its  working now !!
2008-03-03T01:53:00.000Z	danand	x89xx	- did you run that asoundconf set-default-card Live command ?
2008-03-03T01:54:00.000Z	danand	x89xx	- think you may have typed live instead of Live :) - never mind, at least your up and running
2008-03-03T01:55:00.000Z	danand	x89xx	- no problem :) - do you have other users that use that system?
2008-03-03T01:57:00.000Z	danand	x89xx	- think you can set that by running sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg - not too sure if thats entirely right though.
2008-03-03T02:00:00.000Z	danand	x89xx	- just thinking, it may be an idea to prevent that other sound card from loading its drivers at all... maybe worth blacklisting them
2008-03-03T02:16:00.000Z	danand	x89xx	- just thinking, it may be an idea to prevent that other sound card from loading its drivers at all... maybe worth blacklisting them
