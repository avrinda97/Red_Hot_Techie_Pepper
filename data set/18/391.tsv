2012-03-04T00:40:00.000Z	wdsnead		I am a sorta newbie to ubuntu and had connections to the other PCs on my home network. Now when I choose Places/Network I receive the following error message Could not display "network:///" Nautilus cannot handle "network" locations. What have I messed up?

2012-03-04T00:41:00.000Z	wdsnead		back atcha!!!
2012-03-04T00:42:00.000Z	tr33m4n	wdsnead	are you running Nautilus as root?
2012-03-04T00:43:00.000Z	tr33m4n	wdsnead	ah ok, then you weren't running it as root, which is good
2012-03-04T00:45:00.000Z	tr33m4n	wdsnead	is this a fresh install? and what version?
2012-03-04T00:46:00.000Z	wdsnead	tr33m4n	I am running ubuntu 10.04 and have had it installed for about 3 months now... worked great until about a week ago...
2012-03-04T00:48:00.000Z	tr33m4n	wdsnead	can you think of any software you've installed recently, or any system changes you might of made?
2012-03-04T00:51:00.000Z	wdsnead	tr33m4n	did you see my response to Fyodorovna regarding what has changed???
2012-03-04T00:53:00.000Z	tr33m4n	wdsnead	yes I did. Perhaps the default interface has changed in your Network settings... However printer issues keep me awake at night :P
2012-03-04T00:55:00.000Z	tr33m4n	wdsnead	yes but printers back then were designed to work
2012-03-04T00:55:00.000Z	tr33m4n	wdsnead	and JUST printed, rather than scan, fax, make coffeee
2012-03-04T00:56:00.000Z	tr33m4n	wdsnead	connect via wifi :p
2012-03-04T00:59:00.000Z	tr33m4n	wdsnead	I don't think that'll help
2012-03-04T01:00:00.000Z	tr33m4n	wdsnead	might confuse Ubuntu a lot more
2012-03-04T01:02:00.000Z	tr33m4n	wdsnead	does any of this help you at all? https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HpAllInOne
2012-03-04T01:51:00.000Z	wdsnead	tr33m4n	thank you for all of your help! I always get in trouble when I make assumptions. It turns out that the main PC I  was trying to connect to was shut down and when it was rebooted I logged in as administrator. Something had happened to the Windows XP PC and all other users were lost and the workgroup was the default workgroup. Resolving that problem now. Again, thank you for your help!!!!
2012-03-04T01:52:00.000Z	tr33m4n	wdsnead	not a problem, anytime :)
