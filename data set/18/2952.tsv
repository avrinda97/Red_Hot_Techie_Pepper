2011-01-14T01:31:00.000Z	coz_	Phong_	  the differences are in the Desktop environment
2011-01-14T01:32:00.000Z	coz_	Phong_	  well why not go to youtube and search for each of them to get an idea of how they look and function
2011-01-14T01:33:00.000Z	coz_	Phong_	 yes they are
2011-01-14T01:33:00.000Z	coz_	Phong_	  they are using the current release of ubuntu
2011-01-14T01:33:00.000Z	Phong_	coz_	oh well...i'll stick to ubuntu then ;)
2011-01-14T01:33:00.000Z	coz_	Phong_	 thats cool...you can always theme it to look the way you want :)
2011-01-14T01:34:00.000Z	coz_	Phong_	 its unlikely...most linux viruses  seem to be geared towards servers   not desktops
2011-01-14T01:35:00.000Z	Phong_	coz_	even if i go to porn/sex site...no malware will eat my pc ;)
2011-01-14T01:36:00.000Z	coz_	Phong_	  nope  you are safe there since all of the spyware  etc are focused in on windows  not linux....that doesnt mean sometime in the future  it wont happen  but its unlikely
2011-01-14T01:39:00.000Z	coz_	Phong_	 well the reasons can go on and aon
2011-01-14T01:40:00.000Z	coz_	Phong_	  security,,, ease of use... themeable... powerful..  easily changed... etc etc etc etc
2011-01-14T01:41:00.000Z	coz_	Phong_	  in this case google is definitly your friend
