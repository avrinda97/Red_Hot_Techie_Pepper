2008-12-20T01:36:00.000Z	JonathanD		Anyone know how I can get firefox on ubuntu 8.10 working with websense?
2008-12-20T01:37:00.000Z	Neaai	JonathanD	how would IE work differently with websense ?
2008-12-20T01:38:00.000Z	JonathanD	Neaai	IE and FF both work on windows. websense relies (I believe) on the active directory login status of the user on the machine.
2008-12-20T01:38:00.000Z	Neaai	JonathanD	yes, but does IE use Active Directory? you're suggesting it does.
2008-12-20T01:39:00.000Z	JonathanD	Neaai	IE can use AD. I don't think it is in this case (otherwise I Should be getting a proxy login prompt on FF)
2008-12-20T01:39:00.000Z	JonathanD	Neaai	I suspect websense actually checks if the machine the request is coming from is logged into AD>
2008-12-20T01:40:00.000Z	Neaai	JonathanD	you want to use ubuntu then to replace windows in a network that uses AD ?
2008-12-20T01:41:00.000Z	JonathanD	Neaai	no, I want to use ubuntu on a second desktop to suplement my windows machine.
2008-12-20T01:44:00.000Z	Neaai	JonathanD	And what about adding a second ethernet to the windows machine, do NAT from it and feed the connection to your linux? This is just an idea though.
2008-12-20T01:45:00.000Z	JonathanD	Neaai	I can't really do that. Long term, I'm exploring this as the possibility of deploying linux to some folks here. Websense is going to stick around though, so I need to find a broadly deployable way to do this.
2008-12-20T01:47:00.000Z	Neaai	JonathanD	I'm affraid you'd want to check the openLDAP related documentation. Which is overly complicated for my tastes.
2008-12-20T01:47:00.000Z	JonathanD	Neaai	well, I'm already logging into ubuntu using an AD account. This part works.
2008-12-20T01:48:00.000Z	Neaai	JonathanD	I'd guess you're even more than halfway there to what you want to achive.
2008-12-20T01:48:00.000Z	JonathanD	Neaai	one would think...
2008-12-20T01:50:00.000Z	Neaai	JonathanD	I'd check the messages that websesnse generates for these failed attempts. I'm not familiar with websense though, just heared of it.
2008-12-20T01:52:00.000Z	Neaai	JonathanD	but I tell you one thing. In a previous job I had, they used AD and websense and all. Now, with a liveCD, I'd boot up, set the ip addresses and gateway and nameservers as they were in windows, and Iwas good to go.
2008-12-20T01:52:00.000Z	JonathanD	Neaai	I already have the right DNS and gateway :)
2008-12-20T01:53:00.000Z	Neaai	JonathanD	that means you use maybe a newer release of websense. Or maybe it was deploied otherwise in my case. idk.
