2009-09-07T03:27:00.000Z	tim167		hi, can I format allocated space on the disk I am currently running ubuntu on ?
2009-09-07T03:27:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tim167	allocated/used  or unallocated/notused ?
2009-09-07T03:28:00.000Z	tim167	sebsebseb	unallocated sorry
2009-09-07T03:28:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tim167	unallocated space is space  that can be used for a new partition
2009-09-07T03:29:00.000Z	tim167	sebsebseb	unused space, the first partition on the disk is the ubuntu i am currently on, then there's a second partition which is formatted and mounted, and lastly unallocated space, so i can format that without unmounting the other partitions ?
2009-09-07T03:29:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tim167	you don't format unalloacted space, because it's not being used by anything
2009-09-07T03:30:00.000Z	tim167	sebsebseb	or, i mean create a partition on it...
2009-09-07T03:30:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tim167	yes
2009-09-07T03:30:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tim167	install gparted if it's not already installed
2009-09-07T03:31:00.000Z	tim167	sebsebseb	yes i have gparted, ...and how risky is it ? i don't want to break anything in the other 2 partitions...:p
2009-09-07T03:31:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tim167	well you can always backup first before doing anything with partitions, right?    however   if your careful and only  do stuff with the unalloacted space, you should be ok
2009-09-07T03:32:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tim167	what kind of partition do you want to make?
2009-09-07T03:32:00.000Z	tim167	sebsebseb	ok thanks, in fact that was my other question, is there a partition I can make that can be mounted by a mac OSX system ?
2009-09-07T03:32:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tim167	I think nearly anything can,  fat32 and so on
2009-09-07T03:33:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tim167	well fat32  should be able to do for sure
2009-09-07T03:33:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tim167	I don't know much about Macs when it comes to partitining as I expect most people here don't either,  you could ask in ##mac
2009-09-07T03:34:00.000Z	tim167	sebsebseb	hmm but fat32 doesn't allow to write files bigger than 3Gig...
2009-09-07T03:34:00.000Z	sebsebseb	tim167	I am not sure what file systems Mac OS X suppourts, but I expect they know in ##mac
