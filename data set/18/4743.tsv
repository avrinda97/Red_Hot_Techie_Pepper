2010-05-16T08:19:00.000Z	p1oooop	shayisaac	yeah, WINE has a few problems, but it's the best windows emulator there is IMHO... why do you think EVE recommends it?
2010-05-16T08:21:00.000Z	p1oooop	shayisaac	like I said, WINE = problems
2010-05-16T08:21:00.000Z	p1oooop	shayisaac	look up your program on the appdb on the WINE website
2010-05-16T08:24:00.000Z	p1oooop	shayisaac	you can mount it in ubuntu
2010-05-16T08:26:00.000Z	p1oooop	shayisaac	sudo mount -o loop -t (image here) /media/(somthing)
2010-05-16T08:26:00.000Z	p1oooop	shayisaac	and don't forget to make the directory
2010-05-16T08:34:00.000Z	p1oooop	shayisaac	take care :)
2010-05-16T08:35:00.000Z	p1oooop	shayisaac	the terminal IS THE TOOL... it's just kinda hard to use
