2007-07-07T08:55:00.000Z	Hitomaro		Danta, Yondie: I just want to get my swap partition setup with the alternate cd... thats it for now because I have to reinstall
2007-07-07T08:56:00.000Z	stefg	Hitomaro	if you are about to reinstall, then you can just let the installer do it for you.
2007-07-07T08:56:00.000Z	stefg	Hitomaro	man mkswap
2007-07-07T08:59:00.000Z	stefg	Hitomaro	swap doesn't nee a mountpoint . you declare it in /etc/fstab,
2007-07-07T09:02:00.000Z	stefg	Hitomaro	consider windows :-)
2007-07-07T09:02:00.000Z	Hitomaro	stefg	I'm new to ubuntu.. and linux
2007-07-07T09:04:00.000Z	stefg	Hitomaro	so get used to the order of things: 1.) google (with some good search term) 2.) search the documentation and forums 3.) *read it* 4.)  if still in need, don't try to find someone doing the homework for you, but some mentoring on how and where to find a Howto or documentation
2007-07-07T10:17:00.000Z	stefg	Hitomaro	although the screenshot idea is good, the quality is so bad that you can't read anything
2007-07-07T10:20:00.000Z	Hitomaro	stefg	how about this? http://img294.imageshack.us/img294/8066/221252542gg9.jpg
2007-07-07T10:21:00.000Z	stefg	Hitomaro	ok. let me see
2007-07-07T10:22:00.000Z	Hitomaro	stefg	thats the best I could get... I was a recording through tv-out
2007-07-07T10:22:00.000Z	stefg	Hitomaro	good enough to figure it out somehow
2007-07-07T10:22:00.000Z	Hitomaro	stefg	out
2007-07-07T10:24:00.000Z	stefg	Hitomaro	you need one (1) partition to be root that is / )... which is probably sda3. Change that mountpoint to  /
2007-07-07T10:25:00.000Z	Hitomaro	stefg	yeah I know how to change it with livecd install but I don't know how to make it a swap area and a mountpoint to / because it doesn't give you that option
2007-07-07T10:28:00.000Z	stefg	Hitomaro	 (dialog in screenshot 6) press 'tab' to go to the mount-point and enter / there
2007-07-07T10:28:00.000Z	stefg	Hitomaro	sorry, no pm's
2007-07-07T10:28:00.000Z	stefg	Hitomaro	yes
