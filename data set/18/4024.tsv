2012-04-10T12:25:00.000Z	goddard		can anyone help me with this problem http://askubuntu.com/questions/120640/unity-toolbar-icons-disappear-on-boot
2012-04-10T12:26:00.000Z	sw	goddard	ask it here
2012-04-10T12:26:00.000Z	goddard	sw	my toolbar icons disappear on boot
2012-04-10T12:28:00.000Z	sw	goddard	unity?
2012-04-10T12:29:00.000Z	sw	goddard	seen a few folks mention that re-installing can solve that - haven't experienced it myself
2012-04-10T12:29:00.000Z	sw	goddard	unity I mean, not Ubuntu
2012-04-10T12:29:00.000Z	goddard	sw	reinstalling?
2012-04-10T12:29:00.000Z	sw	goddard	'$ sudo apt-get purge unity', restart and login to the classic environment and '$ sudo apt-get install unity'
2012-04-10T12:30:00.000Z	goddard	sw	who knows what that will do
2012-04-10T12:32:00.000Z	sw	goddard	I told you already, that'd re-install unity
2012-04-10T12:34:00.000Z	goddard	sw	I know that would reinstall unity .. but I don't want to reinstall that might screw something up.. I'd rather fix the issue if possible.
2012-04-10T12:35:00.000Z	sw	goddard	how can you "screw up" something that's already screwed up?
2012-04-10T12:36:00.000Z	goddard	sw	i dont have time to reinstall my whole OS and all apps if reinstalling blows up my system
2012-04-10T12:37:00.000Z	sw	goddard	re-installing a desktop environment won't break your system - it's just the environment ...
2012-04-10T12:37:00.000Z	goddard	sw	ok it then
2012-04-10T12:42:00.000Z	goddard	sw	nope didn't work
2012-04-10T12:42:00.000Z	goddard	sw	logged out and logged into unity 2D then logged out and logged into unity and still no toolbar icons
2012-04-10T12:52:00.000Z	goddard	sw	no luck
