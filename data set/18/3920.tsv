2009-07-15T17:28:00.000Z	tumii66		I'm installing ubuntu, should I install 32-bit or 64 ( i have used it for some time)?
2009-07-15T17:29:00.000Z	Slart	tumii66	how much memory do you have?
2009-07-15T17:29:00.000Z	tumii66	Slart	2GB
2009-07-15T17:29:00.000Z	Slart	tumii66	I would go with 32-bit then
2009-07-15T17:29:00.000Z	tumii66	Slart	okay :) thanks
2009-07-15T17:29:00.000Z	Slart	tumii66	you're welcome
2009-07-15T17:31:00.000Z	Slart	tumii66	yes, it does... the problem is that if you want to run 32bit firefox, for example, you need 32bit versions of all the libraries that firefox uses
2009-07-15T17:32:00.000Z	tumii66	Slart	can I install 32-bit software (ex. Firefox) from command line? (is there such a command 'sudo apt-get install firefox-32bit' or so)?
2009-07-15T17:32:00.000Z	Slart	tumii66	the only software I've run into that didn't work on 64bit was a firefox plugin for doing my taxes online.. that was 32bit only, proprietary and very very annoying.. so it might not be a loss after all
2009-07-15T17:32:00.000Z	Slart	tumii66	not that easy.. no
2009-07-15T17:33:00.000Z	tumii66	Slart	then i just get 32-bit :p
2009-07-15T17:33:00.000Z	Slart	tumii66	the advantages of 64bit are limited to some special cases.. the disadvantages are almost even more limited
2009-07-15T17:34:00.000Z	tumii66	Slart	Okay
2009-07-15T17:34:00.000Z	Slart	tumii66	go with 32-bit now and when you reinstall ubuntu 10.4 you can give 64bit a try =)
2009-07-15T17:35:00.000Z	tumii66	Slart	why 10.4? o.O
2009-07-15T17:35:00.000Z	tumii66	Slart	I mean, why wait so long?
2009-07-15T17:36:00.000Z	Slart	tumii66	hehe.. no special reason.. I usually reinstall every third ubuntu version or so.. then upgrade in between
2009-07-15T17:36:00.000Z	tumii66	Slart	okay lol
