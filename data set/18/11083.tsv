2011-06-24T11:15:00.000Z	lotuspsychje	Test_	unity should be default on livecd, are you installing on an older system or logged into gnome classic?
2011-06-24T11:15:00.000Z	Test_	lotuspsychje	 My box is really sweet, I think it may be the fact I have a Nvidia 9800 gt
2011-06-24T11:16:00.000Z	lotuspsychje		Test_:did you install the nvidia additional drivers?
2011-06-24T11:16:00.000Z	Test_	lotuspsychje	Can you do that on a live cd?
2011-06-24T11:17:00.000Z	lotuspsychje	Test_	if the box has an internet connection, yes
2011-06-24T11:17:00.000Z	Test_	lotuspsychje	Yeah I am on the live cd now, but didn't see any restricted drivers pop up
2011-06-24T11:18:00.000Z	lotuspsychje	Test_	so if unity did not load, are you on classic right now?
2011-06-24T11:18:00.000Z	Test_		Well it seems to be classic
2011-06-24T11:18:00.000Z	lotuspsychje	Test_	try loggin out and load ubuntu default(unity) and look what error u get
2011-06-24T11:19:00.000Z	Test_	lotuspsychje	I did that.  The selction says "Ubuntu"
2011-06-24T11:19:00.000Z	Test_		It's not on the classic one
2011-06-24T11:19:00.000Z	Test_		but I think it still is defaulting to classic
2011-06-24T11:20:00.000Z	lotuspsychje	Test_	i had the same promblem installing on an older system, seems like its switching to default as it does not recognize some drivers maybe?
2011-06-24T11:20:00.000Z	Test_	lotuspsychje	 How did you fix it?  My box is actually quite nice, it's still considered top notch at over 2 years old
2011-06-24T11:21:00.000Z	lotuspsychje	Test_	did you try a clean install or u still testing on livecd?
2011-06-24T11:22:00.000Z	Test_	lotuspsychje	Testing on a live cd still.  Going to test unity before I decide to try out Fedora for Gnome 3.  I love gnome, so not to thrilled about the unity bit.  But I know 11.10 has Gnome 3..but that's alpha..so no good for me atm
2011-06-24T11:23:00.000Z	lotuspsychje	Test_	i highly recommend clean install with installing additional drivers at boot install, unity is great on high end hardware
2011-06-24T11:23:00.000Z	Test_	lotuspsychje	Mind if I PM you?
