2010-04-23T12:55:00.000Z	strings_	bzrk	if you are installing to say /opt/foo you dont need dpkg anyways
2010-04-23T12:50:00.000Z	strings_	bzrk	you should just have to do something like . ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/foo or I would use /opt/foo
2010-04-23T12:50:00.000Z	bzrk	strings_	yeah i added that to the configure part of the rules file but it did not make it in the final package, though it was shown during the making
2010-04-23T12:51:00.000Z	strings_	bzrk	you are rebuilding a dpkg?
2010-04-23T12:51:00.000Z	bzrk	strings_	no i am building from a .tgz
2010-04-23T12:52:00.000Z	strings_	bzrk	if youare build from source code. ./configure --prefix should work. along with make install
2010-04-23T12:53:00.000Z	bzrk	strings_	the normal ./configure && make && make install does, but not debuild unfortunately :(
2010-04-23T12:54:00.000Z	bzrk	strings_	ive read the debian new maintainers manual but i didnt find anything regarding unusual (e.g. non /usr) package building
2010-04-23T12:54:00.000Z	strings_	bzrk	ah ya not too sure how you would do that with dpkg I dont use it when I complie source by hand.
2010-04-23T12:54:00.000Z	bzrk	strings_	ah ok thx anyway :)
2010-04-23T12:55:00.000Z	strings_	bzrk	unless you plan on making a dpkg for deployment
2010-04-23T12:55:00.000Z	bzrk	strings_	no the package is to be installed on a couple of machines, so i want a package to reduce the hassle
2010-04-23T12:57:00.000Z	bzrk	strings_	found it :) you need to edit the dirs file in the debian directory
2010-04-23T12:58:00.000Z	strings_	bzrk	so change the conf_args in ruls?
2010-04-23T12:58:00.000Z	strings_	bzrk	err rules
2010-04-23T13:00:00.000Z	strings_	bzrk	thanks good to know. I assume you just adjust the rules file?
2010-04-23T13:01:00.000Z	bzrk	strings_	i thought so but the right place to edit was the dirs file
2010-04-23T13:02:00.000Z	strings_	bzrk	aslong as you have it sorted out.
