2006-12-04T17:03:00.000Z	Matthew_W		Hey - I have a real problem with the root/user password on the Breezy LiveCD.
2006-12-04T17:04:00.000Z	Matthew_W		I set a password during the livecd bootup, and now it's not the same, which is irritating!
2006-12-04T17:04:00.000Z	Matthew_W		Tried.
2006-12-04T17:04:00.000Z	Matthew_W		It's not.
2006-12-04T17:05:00.000Z	Matthew_W		Irritating.
2006-12-04T17:05:00.000Z	Matthew_W		I don't know how to fix this and I need to fix my bloody partition.
2006-12-04T17:06:00.000Z	LjL	Matthew_W	i don't know about your issue, but you should probably leave Breezy behind anyway... it's old. in a couple of months, it won't be supported anymore.
2006-12-04T17:06:00.000Z	LjL		!anyone
2006-12-04T17:06:00.000Z	Matthew_W	LjL	I'm doing an install of MacOSX and using Breezy to partition the hard drive, so needless to say I need to run GParted or install an equivalent partition editor for bash, and I can't without a password.
2006-12-04T17:07:00.000Z	LjL	Matthew_W	given it's just the live CD, why don't you... reboot?
2006-12-04T17:07:00.000Z	Matthew_W	LjL	- This has happened more than once.
2006-12-04T17:07:00.000Z	Matthew_W	LjL	- That's the first thing I did.
2006-12-04T17:08:00.000Z	LjL	Matthew_W	well, i don't really remember what the breezy CD was like, in dapper the username is "ubuntu" and the password is blank (though it doesn't ask for the username by default, in GDM)
2006-12-04T17:09:00.000Z	Matthew_W		xubuntu is xfce
2006-12-04T17:09:00.000Z	Matthew_W		LjL-  well rg.  This is insanely irritating.
2006-12-04T17:09:00.000Z	Matthew_W	LjL	because I need to edit the partitions one way or another here.
2006-12-04T17:09:00.000Z	Matthew_W	LjL	there's no workaround in the LiveCD or a bug or something I can exploit ffs?
2006-12-04T17:10:00.000Z	LjL	Matthew_W	i haven't a clue tbh
