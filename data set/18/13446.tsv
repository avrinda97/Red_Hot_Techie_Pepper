2006-01-03T13:13:00.000Z	cvt|ubuntu		when i try to install java it says "couldn't find sun-j2re1.5" but i have it on my desktop. ideas?
2006-01-03T13:14:00.000Z	polpak	cvt|ubuntu	did you cd to ~/Desktop before running dpkg -i sun-jre*
2006-01-03T13:14:00.000Z	cvt|ubuntu	polpak	no. how do i do that?
2006-01-03T13:14:00.000Z	polpak	cvt|ubuntu	open a terminal and type cd ~/Desktop
2006-01-03T13:15:00.000Z	cvt|ubuntu	polpak	it said the same.
2006-01-03T13:18:00.000Z	polpak	cvt|ubuntu	what's the trouble?
2006-01-03T13:26:00.000Z	cvt|ubuntu	polpak	i got the package from ubotu and followed the instructions but it still says "couldn't find package sun-j2re1.5" and i cd to desktop. ideas?
2006-01-03T13:28:00.000Z	polpak	cvt|ubuntu	I think you need dpkg -i
2006-01-03T13:28:00.000Z	polpak	cvt|ubuntu	but you may be doing something other than what I'm thinking of
2006-01-03T13:37:00.000Z	polpak	cvt|ubuntu	it means you probably need different instructions
2006-01-03T13:41:00.000Z	cvt|ubuntu	polpak	do you know anything else i can do to get java?
2006-01-03T13:41:00.000Z	polpak	cvt|ubuntu	yeah, one sec
2006-01-03T13:42:00.000Z	polpak	cvt|ubuntu	this is specifically for Hoary... http://ubuntuguide.org/#jre
2006-01-03T13:42:00.000Z	polpak	cvt|ubuntu	but It's probably just a good idea to upgrade to breezy anyway
2006-01-03T13:50:00.000Z	cvt|ubuntu	polpak	i followed those instructions but it didn't work yet. should i get breezy?
2006-01-03T13:50:00.000Z	polpak	cvt|ubuntu	I'd suggest doing that. It'll probably be easier in the long run
2006-01-03T13:51:00.000Z	cvt|ubuntu	polpak	do u know how to get breezy?
2006-01-03T13:52:00.000Z	polpak	cvt|ubuntu	sudo apt-get dist-upgrade I think will work
