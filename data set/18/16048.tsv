2004-11-24T15:00:00.000Z	shoey	moyogo	i must be missing something because i dont have that gdm file
2004-11-24T15:00:00.000Z	moyogo	shoey	hmmm
2004-11-24T15:01:00.000Z	moyogo	shoey	do you have the package "gdm" installed?
2004-11-24T15:02:00.000Z	shoey		not sure
2004-11-24T15:02:00.000Z	moyogo	shoey	what does "dpkg-query -s gdm" show?
2004-11-24T15:02:00.000Z	moyogo	shoey	that's really weird, if it's not installed, it should be by default
