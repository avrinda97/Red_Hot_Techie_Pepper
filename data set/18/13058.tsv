2006-06-11T05:01:00.000Z	rixth	pianoboy3333	http://www.stellarinfo.com/linux-data-recovery.htm Windows program. Totally excellent. Try it out, the demo version will allow you to see what files can be recovered.
2006-06-11T05:03:00.000Z	rixth	pianoboy3333	I have already told you my advice. Load Windows onto a computer, plug your drive in to that computer as slave, then use Stellar Phoenix to have a lookie.
