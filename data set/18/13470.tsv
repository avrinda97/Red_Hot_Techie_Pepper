2006-07-20T13:32:00.000Z	King		Im using Ubuntu 6.06 I need read and write access fro my windows NTFS hard drives. Is ntfs-3g the best option and is writing to ntfs partitions really safe to do with Linux and third party apps?? <--------
2006-07-20T13:33:00.000Z	SWAT	King	you're asking for trouble if you want that
2006-07-20T13:33:00.000Z	King	SWAT	Really? Some people over here earlier recommended that for me...
2006-07-20T13:34:00.000Z	SWAT	King	safe useage: use a FAT32 partition for read/writing in Windows and Linux. NTFS writing could screw up your Windows partition. Remember that NTFS is not an open format
2006-07-20T13:35:00.000Z	SWAT	King	you can write to a NTFS partition using Linux, but I wouldn't call it safe. Use it on your own risk. Don't come crying here if you have data corruption ;-)
2006-07-20T13:35:00.000Z	King	SWAT	Thanks, maybe I'll change my NTFS partitions to FAT32, though that makes XP a lil slower. How Fast linux writes to FAT32?
2006-07-20T13:36:00.000Z	SWAT	King	FAT32 is commonly supported, it just works. Tip: there are several Windows tools with which you can convert NTFS to FAT32 without data loss
2006-07-20T13:41:00.000Z	King	SWAT	Im using Jetico Bestcrypt. It's good it has Blowfish-448 encryption. It's very strong
2006-07-20T13:42:00.000Z	SWAT	King	on-the-fly encryption and 'free' software?
2006-07-20T13:44:00.000Z	King	SWAT	Jetico Bestcrypt is free for Linux, but I guess it's not open source
2006-07-20T13:46:00.000Z	SWAT	King	there are also windows tools that can read from linux partitions and you can read data from your windows ntfs partition in linux. So read/read usually works fine ;)
2006-07-20T13:48:00.000Z	King	SWAT	Yeah reading works fine but what I really need is a good write access to my windows partitions. Otherwise I might as well use XP.
2006-07-20T13:48:00.000Z	SWAT	King	then you should really use FAT32 or completely switch to Ubuntu :)
2006-07-20T13:50:00.000Z	King	SWAT	I change NTFS to FAT32 and see how it work <-------
2006-07-20T13:50:00.000Z	SWAT	King	you don't need to use '<---', it's annoying
2006-07-20T13:51:00.000Z	SWAT	King	I recommend minimal of 3GB for linux, but if possible >10GB, then you have some 'play space' left
2006-07-20T13:51:00.000Z	SWAT	King	should suffice
2006-07-20T13:52:00.000Z	King	SWAT	Adam-g: Can I resize partitions in Linux? Can I merge partitions in linux?
