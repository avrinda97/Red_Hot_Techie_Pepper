2008-04-24T21:19:00.000Z	linux__alien		Hi anyone running 8.04 on laptop ?
2008-04-24T21:20:00.000Z	linux__alien		does Intel ABG 3945 Wireless card work in 8.04 ?
2008-04-24T21:20:00.000Z	linux__alien		is the bug solved?
2008-04-24T21:20:00.000Z	linux__alien		cos 8.04 uses iwl3945 driver
2008-04-24T21:20:00.000Z	linux__alien		is it still broken ?
2008-04-24T21:21:00.000Z	linux__alien		is anyone using it ??
2008-04-24T21:21:00.000Z	eternal_p	linux__alien	running it now
2008-04-24T21:21:00.000Z	linux__alien	eternal_p	so the bug in hardy beta is solved?
2008-04-24T21:21:00.000Z	eternal_p	linux__alien	works fine...although if you want your WiFi led to work, download backports for a better version
2008-04-24T21:22:00.000Z	linux__alien	eternal_p	ok
2008-04-24T21:22:00.000Z	eternal_p	linux__alien	what bug?
2008-04-24T21:22:00.000Z	linux__alien	eternal_p	so in the live CD itself it works i dont need to do anything extra to make it work in my dell Inspiron 1520 ?
2008-04-24T21:22:00.000Z	eternal_p		linux_alien: if the live CD works, the OS will work too
2008-04-24T21:22:00.000Z	eternal_p		that is the point of the live CD
2008-04-24T21:23:00.000Z	linux__alien	eternal_p	no what i meant was did you install any packages extra to make it work or it just recognized your Router ? coz the bug in Beta was if you uses WPA2 encryption it wouldnt work
2008-04-24T21:24:00.000Z	eternal_p		linux_alien: I run WPA2, never needed any extra packages
2008-04-24T21:24:00.000Z	linux__alien	eternal_p	great thanks then i am off to install Hardy . Did you upgrade it or did a clean install?
2008-04-24T21:24:00.000Z	eternal_p	linux__alien	I always prefer a clean install
