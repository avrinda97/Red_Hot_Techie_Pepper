2005-03-01T07:43:00.000Z	ompaul	shadeofgrey	how so?
2005-03-01T07:47:00.000Z	ompaul	shadeofgrey	you could of course buy up all the companies that own the mp3 stuff and force them to release it for free or you could say to hell with that and get with the progam - ogg or some such
2005-03-01T07:52:00.000Z	ompaul	shadeofgrey	stand back from that comment for a minute. My wife has her first computer - she has been using that other stuff for years - I installed ubuntu for her and she loves it so much that she is thinking that maybe her fathers first pc should have it too, and he only has like 4 weeks of class room experiance
2005-03-01T16:10:00.000Z	shadeofgrey	ompaul	 can you assist me with my sources.list file - it was sent to me last night via email and i know it works i just cant recall where to put it
