2008-07-26T10:59:00.000Z	LitomoSilver		o_o
2008-07-26T11:00:00.000Z	LitomoSilver		That would help, Daniel_2
2008-07-26T11:00:00.000Z	LitomoSilver		Same, prince_jammys
2008-07-26T11:02:00.000Z	LitomoSilver		Yeah you did do wrong, Daniel_2
2008-07-26T11:04:00.000Z	LitomoSilver		Really, Saladin?
2008-07-26T11:04:00.000Z	LitomoSilver		Didn't know that. Should be useful to know.
2008-07-26T11:05:00.000Z	LitomoSilver		This is why I have a dual-boot config. >_>;
2008-07-26T11:05:00.000Z	LitomoSilver		XP and Ubuntu. Though this computer will be wiped clean soon and have Xubuntu installed on it... or Kubuntu.
2008-07-26T11:05:00.000Z	LitomoSilver		I can't remember which ones is for slower computers.
2008-07-26T11:06:00.000Z	prince_jammys	LitomoSilver	 xu. but flux is good too
2008-07-26T11:06:00.000Z	prince_jammys	LitomoSilver	the fluxbox desktop
2008-07-26T11:07:00.000Z	prince_jammys	LitomoSilver	sudo apt-get install fluxbox
2008-07-26T11:08:00.000Z	prince_jammys	LitomoSilver	getting it setting up involves work, but it's pretty cool once you have it the way you want it. xubuntu is easier
2008-07-26T11:09:00.000Z	prince_jammys	LitomoSilver	yep
2008-07-26T11:11:00.000Z	prince_jammys	LitomoSilver	time......
2008-07-26T11:12:00.000Z	LitomoSilver	prince_jammys	I know it takes time. :P I mean what do I do to kickstart the fluxbox config?
2008-07-26T11:13:00.000Z	prince_jammys	LitomoSilver	log out of your current session, and switch to 'fluxbox' in the sessions menu of the login screen
