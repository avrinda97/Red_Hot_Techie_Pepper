2007-12-10T03:44:00.000Z	marupa		Anyone here know how to record from separate video and audio devices?
2007-12-10T03:44:00.000Z	ikonia	marupa	record using what application ?
2007-12-10T03:44:00.000Z	ikonia	marupa	you should be able to specify video and audio streams from most encoders
2007-12-10T03:44:00.000Z	marupa	ikonia	mencoder, preferrably.
2007-12-10T03:44:00.000Z	ikonia	marupa	that shouldn't be a problem before, I've done something very similar
2007-12-10T03:45:00.000Z	marupa	ikonia	if my video adapter plays in tvtime, it's probably /dev/video0, right?
2007-12-10T03:45:00.000Z	ikonia	marupa	normallly
2007-12-10T03:45:00.000Z	marupa	ikonia	and my line-in would normally be what though?
2007-12-10T04:14:00.000Z	ikonia	marupa	mplayer doesn't have a decoder
2007-12-10T04:14:00.000Z	marupa	ikonia	How would I test my settings then?
2007-12-10T04:15:00.000Z	ikonia	marupa	test your settings, if mplayer doesn't have a decoder you can't test it
2007-12-10T04:15:00.000Z	marupa	ikonia	if tvtime can decode it, mplayer should be able to.
2007-12-10T04:15:00.000Z	ikonia	marupa	why, they are different applications, marupa tvtime will have a decoder on it,
2007-12-10T04:16:00.000Z	ikonia	marupa	I'm not aware of anyone trying to use mplayer as a video in/tc decoder
2007-12-10T04:16:00.000Z	marupa	ikonia	then how would I record video from my video-in adapter?
2007-12-10T04:16:00.000Z	ikonia	marupa	use a capture program
2007-12-10T04:16:00.000Z	marupa	ikonia	such as?
2007-12-10T04:16:00.000Z	ikonia	marupa	no idea, I don't use one
