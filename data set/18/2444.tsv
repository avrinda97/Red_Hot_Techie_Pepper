2010-05-30T06:18:00.000Z	pietro10		Is there a way I can get the "Broadcom B43 Wireless Driver" without using Restricted Packages? I'll put it on a flash drive and send it to the other computer.
2010-05-30T06:18:00.000Z	pietro10		I'm not sure how to navigate the online package thing...
2010-05-30T06:18:00.000Z	pietro10		and I can't connect to the internet on the system running ubuntu

2010-05-30T06:19:00.000Z	tertl3	pietro10	you say wired isnt working?
2010-05-30T06:20:00.000Z	tertl3	pietro10	that isnt right, it is HP?
2010-05-30T06:21:00.000Z	tertl3	pietro10	wired should work I would think
2010-05-30T06:21:00.000Z	tertl3	pietro10	I think you just need to change some settings
2010-05-30T06:23:00.000Z	tertl3	pietro10	you could try to move the driver over with a CD or something?
2010-05-30T08:00:00.000Z	tertl3	pietro10	no lucks still?
