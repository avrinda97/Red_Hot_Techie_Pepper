2006-03-09T11:00:00.000Z	dli		wvdial doesn't dial out, any hsfmodem + wvdial user?
2006-03-09T11:01:00.000Z	sudharsh	dli	i use wvdial but only use a cdma wireless terminal
2006-03-09T11:03:00.000Z	sudharsh	dli	usin the same wvdial.conf should wwork
2006-03-09T11:04:00.000Z	dli	sudharsh	yes, the same wvdial.conf (from wvdialconf)
2006-03-09T11:04:00.000Z	dli	sudharsh	but it just doesn't dial when it should
2006-03-09T11:05:00.000Z	sudharsh	dli	try appendin stupid mode =on
2006-03-09T11:05:00.000Z	dli	sudharsh	could be something like waiting for dial tone
2006-03-09T11:05:00.000Z	dli	sudharsh	I tried "Stupid Mode = Yes "
2006-03-09T11:07:00.000Z	sudharsh	dli	yikes
2006-03-09T11:07:00.000Z	dli	sudharsh	can get hsfmodem in gentoo :(
2006-03-09T11:08:00.000Z	dli	sudharsh	do you know how to force wvdial to dial? not waiting for anything at sending ATDT*****
2006-03-09T11:08:00.000Z	sudharsh	dli	if u r certain u r usin the same conf file try gettin the drivers
2006-03-09T11:08:00.000Z	sudharsh	dli	i suppose stupid mode is for dat..
2006-03-09T11:09:00.000Z	dli	sudharsh	not the same file, but both from "wvdialconf /etc/wvdial.conf"
2006-03-09T11:09:00.000Z	sudharsh	dli	aha...use the same file....
2006-03-09T11:10:00.000Z	sudharsh	dli	ur gentoo box is usable..so open up that conf file and copy the contents as it is
2006-03-09T11:11:00.000Z	dli	sudharsh	not easily, so, I just checked, couldn't see any difference by eye
2006-03-09T11:12:00.000Z	sudharsh	dli	u gotta show us the contetnts
