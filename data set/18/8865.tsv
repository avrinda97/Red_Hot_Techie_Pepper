2008-03-06T08:16:00.000Z	SilentDis		quick question for everyone.  from your experiences, what is a decent size for a / partition (excluding /home, including /tmp) for a more 'average' user?
2008-03-06T08:18:00.000Z	arrrghhh	SilentDis	i run / with 6 gigs and /home gets everything else.
2008-03-06T08:18:00.000Z	arrrghhh	SilentDis	it really depends on how big the hdd is and where you're planning on storing things.
2008-03-06T08:19:00.000Z	SilentDis	arrrghhh	my mom's 'puter.  gonna give it a shot in the arm.  when i built it, it ran Ubuntu 6.10 with a mere 8gb drive in total.  i only gave / 3gb, which is WAY too small.  was trying to think of ways to solve this
2008-03-06T08:20:00.000Z	arrrghhh	SilentDis	hrm... 8 gigs is a big small.  buy her a 40 gig hdd.  they're cheapo i'm sure.
2008-03-06T08:23:00.000Z	arrrghhh	SilentDis	oh yea.  i mean if you gave everything to / and had a small swap (512mb or so) might also work.,...
2008-03-06T08:23:00.000Z	arrrghhh	SilentDis	or / gets 5 gigs and /home gets 2.5 gigs and swap gets 512mb.
2008-03-06T08:24:00.000Z	arrrghhh	SilentDis	that's close tho... i'd recommend 6gigs min. for /.  and if she likes doin that, get her a bigger hdd or don't tell her the root pass lol
2008-03-06T08:24:00.000Z	SilentDis	arrrghhh	i tried the whole 'no root access for you!' method.... she was calling me every day :P
2008-03-06T08:25:00.000Z	arrrghhh	SilentDis	ouch... yea... hrm.  just give her a bigger hdd and burn that 8gig POS.
2008-03-06T08:25:00.000Z	SilentDis	arrrghhh	so, drop a 40g+ in there, and put / on a 10g partition?
2008-03-06T08:26:00.000Z	arrrghhh	SilentDis	and you'll be golden my friend.
2008-03-06T08:27:00.000Z	SilentDis	arrrghhh	i just worry... she bought a digital camera and fancies herself a serious professional picture taker... you know, of dogs... bugs... blurry looking sunsets...  roflmao
2008-03-06T08:27:00.000Z	arrrghhh	SilentDis	well yea, but with a 30+ gig /home partition she should be fine.
2008-03-06T08:34:00.000Z	arrrghhh	SilentDis	why not just install kubuntu on her machine?
2008-03-06T08:36:00.000Z	SilentDis	arrrghhh	i thought about that... but she's been using gnome for a while now, not sure if she can take such a change ;)
2008-03-06T08:37:00.000Z	arrrghhh	SilentDis	hrm... i dunno, i think kde is friendlier, but gnome does tend to hide things so newbies can't get in too much trouble.  kde just seems to be more mature.  and i'm not starting a flame war here people, so don't get pissed at my PERSONAL opinion.
2008-03-06T08:38:00.000Z	SilentDis	arrrghhh	i am in agreement myself, it is really just personal taste.  i switched to kde about 1 month after going linux full time, too :)
