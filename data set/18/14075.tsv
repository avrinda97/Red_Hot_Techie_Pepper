2005-09-16T11:37:00.000Z	Tidus		i have a question.  how the heck do i install the nomachine NX client?  it's not in any ubuntu apt repository that i know of, and the source built version won't even run
2005-09-16T11:38:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Tidus	most people use the one from the noMachine site (non-free, but works fine)
2005-09-16T11:38:00.000Z	Tidus	thoreauputic	it keeps giving me a weird error that libstdc++6 isn't installed, even when it is
2005-09-16T11:39:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Tidus	also see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/FreeNX
2005-09-16T11:39:00.000Z	Tidus	thoreauputic	i'm just looking into the client.
2005-09-16T11:39:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Tidus	seveas has made debs for us
2005-09-16T11:47:00.000Z	Tidus	thoreauputic	do you know where i can find an nxclient .deb compiled for ubuntu?  it's not in the repository that's mentioned in the wiki site you gave me
2005-09-16T11:47:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Tidus	not off the top of my head, no - I used the one from noMachine
2005-09-16T11:48:00.000Z	Tidus	thoreauputic	which one did you use.
2005-09-16T11:48:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Tidus	but I tried it a while ago
2005-09-16T11:48:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Tidus	I honestly don't remember - I just tried it as an experiment - worked well
2005-09-16T12:05:00.000Z	Tidus	thoreauputic	here's the error i'm getting with the nx client itself.
2005-09-16T12:07:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Tidus	I can't really help, sorry - I don't know enough about it. If youcame back later possibly Seves could help you
2005-09-16T12:07:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Tidus	sorry I mean Seveas
2005-09-16T12:07:00.000Z	Tidus	thoreauputic	that's ok.  my NX server's not up right now anyway.  it's undergoing its system install
2005-09-16T12:07:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Tidus	he built the stuff on the wiki page Ipointed you to
2005-09-16T12:07:00.000Z	Tidus	thoreauputic	all that's there is the freenx server, but not the client itself.
2005-09-16T12:08:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Tidus	I'm aware of that: I was suggesting you consult Seveas because he is often here and knows about freenx
