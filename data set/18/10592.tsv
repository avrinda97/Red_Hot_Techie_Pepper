2006-11-11T16:50:00.000Z	aduarte		Hi everyone, I need some help
2006-11-11T16:51:00.000Z	aduarte		I'm deleting some files from my Hard Drive, but I do not recover my Space, Any idea?
2006-11-11T16:51:00.000Z	fooadd	aduarte	how are yo deleting them ? via GUI or using rm?
2006-11-11T16:52:00.000Z	aduarte	fooadd	both methods
2006-11-11T16:52:00.000Z	fooadd	aduarte	 using nautilus?
2006-11-11T16:53:00.000Z	aduarte	fooadd	Yes, (but these are not located on lost+found or .Trash)
2006-11-11T16:53:00.000Z	aduarte	fooadd	There is something wrong, even from terminal I do not recover my HD space
2006-11-11T16:54:00.000Z	fooadd	aduarte	is there a specific partition that you are having a problem with? or is it your root partition?
2006-11-11T16:54:00.000Z	aduarte	fooadd	Actually is a extra HD
2006-11-11T16:54:00.000Z	aduarte	fooadd	But the problem seems to be only on it.
2006-11-11T16:55:00.000Z	fooadd	aduarte	those partition are fat ? nautilus makes a hidden directory sometimes, and moves the deleted files to it
2006-11-11T16:57:00.000Z	aduarte	fooadd	No, its a ext3, and the files are not hidden, since I already look for those, I even delete those by Shift+Del or "rm file.ext" but the problem is the same
2006-11-11T16:58:00.000Z	fooadd	aduarte	, df -h , delete some files, df -h again, no space regained?
2006-11-11T16:59:00.000Z	aduarte	fooadd	No, I already try that
2006-11-11T16:59:00.000Z	fooadd	aduarte	weird....
2006-11-11T16:59:00.000Z	aduarte	fooadd	Yes, I even fsck.ext3 that partition, and the same
2006-11-11T17:00:00.000Z	fooadd	aduarte	really weird... where does the freaking space go?!? :P
2006-11-11T17:01:00.000Z	aduarte	fooadd	I know, is hard to think that the file system is damaged, since I just create it 2 days ago
