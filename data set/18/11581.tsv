2006-12-27T17:22:00.000Z	Some_Person	alex-weej	how else can ubuntu be installed?
2006-12-27T17:23:00.000Z	alex-weej	Some_Person	lots and lots of different ways :)
2006-12-27T17:23:00.000Z	Some_Person	alex-weej	?
2006-12-27T17:25:00.000Z	Some_Person	alex-weej	how else can ubuntu be installed than booting a cd?
2006-12-27T17:25:00.000Z	alex-weej	Some_Person	netinstall from an existing UNIX installation, off a usb key, etc.
2006-12-27T17:27:00.000Z	alex-weej	Some_Person	why would you want to do that? can you not boot the 6.10 live cd?
2006-12-27T17:27:00.000Z	alex-weej	Some_Person	have you tried the minimal CD?
2006-12-29T13:48:00.000Z	alex-weej	Some_Person	sudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst
2006-12-29T14:08:00.000Z	alex-weej	Some_Person	hide them from what?
2006-12-29T14:26:00.000Z	alex-weej	Some_Person	show them WHERE?
2006-12-29T14:27:00.000Z	alex-weej	Some_Person	do you want to hide the volumes completely? or just the names?
2006-12-29T14:27:00.000Z	alex-weej	Some_Person	are you sure? you want just the icon without a name!?
2006-12-29T14:28:00.000Z	alex-weej	Some_Person	i don't think so
2006-12-29T14:28:00.000Z	alex-weej	Some_Person	it's generally considered that it's much more friendly that your volumes show up as "FAMILY GUY SEASON 1" than "sda"
2006-12-29T14:29:00.000Z	alex-weej	Some_Person	bring it up on Launchpad as a support request, and see what happens
2006-12-29T14:35:00.000Z	alex-weej	Some_Person	now THAT's easy
2006-12-29T14:36:00.000Z	alex-weej	Some_Person	gconf-editor /apps/nautilus/desktop/volumes_visible
