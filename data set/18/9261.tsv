2007-04-30T10:57:00.000Z	phratman		Hey all, out of curiosity, is there any way around this?
2007-04-30T10:57:00.000Z	phratman		ssh user@server 'sudo command' will demand that I enter a password twice.
2007-04-30T10:57:00.000Z	phratman		The first one, obvious, is to allow me access to the machine.
2007-04-30T10:58:00.000Z	phratman		The second time however, it asks for what to feed sudo and then it displays my password in cleartext!
2007-04-30T10:58:00.000Z	dade	phratman	: no
2007-04-30T10:58:00.000Z	phratman	dade	?
2007-04-30T10:58:00.000Z	phratman	dade	You mean, that's a design decision that is stuck in place?
2007-04-30T10:58:00.000Z	dade	phratman	you have to enter pwd twice
2007-04-30T10:59:00.000Z	phratman	dade	Yes, obviously, but I'm more worried about the fact that the password shows up in *cleartext*
2007-04-30T10:59:00.000Z	dade	phratman	yes... one is for logging in into your account via ssh, the other is exec a command as root
2007-04-30T11:00:00.000Z	phratman	dade	So what are you suggesting as a workaround?
2007-04-30T11:00:00.000Z	dade	phratman	so they are two different things that may require two different pwds
2007-04-30T11:00:00.000Z	dade	phratman	what i usually do is log in with ssh
2007-04-30T11:00:00.000Z	dade	phratman	then do everything as root
2007-04-30T11:01:00.000Z	phratman	dade	Yeah, that's not what I asked. I already know how to do that. According to someone in #kubuntu it's ssh -t user@host 'sudo command'
2007-04-30T11:02:00.000Z	dade	phratman	ok ;) does it work as a workaround?
2007-04-30T11:02:00.000Z	phratman	dade	Yes, but in the future, I will use ssh -t and I suggest you do the same if you're only doing a one liner for many machines in a script as well to save your fingers the effort :)
2007-04-30T11:03:00.000Z	dade	phratman	thanks, good to know :D
