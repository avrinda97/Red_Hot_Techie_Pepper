2012-02-16T23:24:00.000Z	elzoog		Hello everyone.  I have two questions, both are related to the iPhone
2012-02-16T23:25:00.000Z	elzoog		1.  How do I sync an  iPhone to Ubuntu?   I already tried this  http://geeknizer.com/sync-iphone-linux/  The ppa mentioned there doesn't work
2012-02-16T23:26:00.000Z	theadmin	elzoog	Use Rhythmbox, it does it for the music at least
2012-02-16T23:27:00.000Z	elzoog		Thanks theadmin
2012-02-16T23:29:00.000Z	elzoog	theadmin	Do you know of any easy way to develop apps using Ubuntu?
2012-02-16T23:29:00.000Z	theadmin	elzoog	That question doesn't make much sense. What programming language are you trying to use?
2012-02-16T23:30:00.000Z	elzoog	theadmin	Would like to use Java, but I don't care.   Seems like the main hurdle is to compile it in a way that the iPhone can run it
2012-02-16T23:30:00.000Z	theadmin	elzoog	Hm, no idea how to compile iPhone stuff without xcode actually, sorry
2012-02-16T23:31:00.000Z	elzoog	theadmin	To be more specific, I would like to write a program in Ubuntu and run it on my iPhone
2012-02-16T23:31:00.000Z	elzoog	theadmin	What if I somehow run Mac OS Lion as a virtual machine and install xcode?
2012-02-16T23:34:00.000Z	theadmin	elzoog	Complicated... Try the Windows version of xcode in wine
2012-02-16T23:35:00.000Z	theadmin	elzoog	If that doesn't work, probably use a Windows VM... macs are hard to install on any VMs
2012-02-16T23:35:00.000Z	elzoog	theadmin	From what I read on the web, I gather it's complicated
2012-02-16T23:38:00.000Z	elzoog	theadmin	This site says that to get xcode running in Windows, you have to still run Mac OS as a virtual machine   http://techexxpert.blogspot.com/2011/08/how-to-virtualize-os-x-lion-on-windows.html
2012-02-16T23:38:00.000Z	theadmin	elzoog	Oh, wow...
2012-02-16T23:38:00.000Z	theadmin	elzoog	Hm.
2012-02-16T23:38:00.000Z	theadmin	elzoog	Well I've no idea, I'm not into Apple stuff
2012-02-16T23:39:00.000Z	elzoog	theadmin	Apple sure doesn't make it easy to do things outside of their proprietary OS or hardware.   They seem to be even worse than Windows in that regard
