2009-11-25T00:50:00.000Z	exxxo45		hello there, could anyone tell me please how to install ubuntu 9.10 and Windows Vista side by side? Help would be appreciated!
2009-11-25T00:50:00.000Z	sebsebseb	exxxo45	yes ok
2009-11-25T00:51:00.000Z	sebsebseb	exxxo45	 Setting up a seperate /home is good in the long run,  when you have a reason to re install Ubuntu, or if you want to distro hop
2009-11-25T00:52:00.000Z	sebsebseb	exxxo45	by default it puts everything in  /  which is the  Ubuntu partition
2009-11-25T00:53:00.000Z	sebsebseb	exxxo45	I meant it's easier to set up a seperate /home on a new install.  That's where your data will go, and program user data.
2009-11-25T00:53:00.000Z	sebsebseb	exxxo45	blue screen?
2009-11-25T00:53:00.000Z	sebsebseb	exxxo45	Your getting Blue Screen Of Death in Windows?
2009-11-25T00:57:00.000Z	sebsebseb	exxxo45	Blue Screen of Death in Windows, is not good, not good at all!
2009-11-25T00:59:00.000Z	exxxo45	sebsebseb	yes, I Windows would start. I tried to find a solution online, but I couldn't find a good solution
2009-11-25T01:00:00.000Z	sebsebseb	exxxo45	From my own personal experience when it has come to  Blue Screen Of Death in Windows  with two computers where it has happended.   Windows will complain at the slight hardware error or anything like that,  Ubuntu and other Linux distros for that matter will just ignore it and carry on as normal.  They won't just tell you that there is some sort of problem.
2009-11-25T01:01:00.000Z	sebsebseb	exxxo45	however if it is really failing hardware, eventaully it will fail on you, and Ubuntu won't boot up anymore either
2009-11-25T01:02:00.000Z	exxxo45	sebsebseb	I don't think it would be a hardware problem, Vista's were working fine untill I installed Ubuntu from the live CD
2009-11-25T01:03:00.000Z	sebsebseb	exxxo45	So really you should try and get your Blue Screen Of  Death fixed,  depending on what the error is,  that error might  casue problems for Ubuntu later on as well.
2009-11-25T01:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	exxxo45	Well you can  get the error message and  ask people in ##windows about it for example
2009-11-25T01:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	exxxo45	Ubuntu does not cause Windows to Blue Screen Of Death!
2009-11-25T01:10:00.000Z	exxxo45	sebsebseb	how do I get the content of the blue screen? is it in a log of somekind? It appears for less than a second
2009-11-25T01:11:00.000Z	sebsebseb	exxxo45	I think there's a button you can press or something to make it appear for longer,  get help with that kind of stuff in ##windows and good luck :)
2009-11-25T01:14:00.000Z	sebsebseb	exxxo45	you can do thank you's in here, no need to pm me with one
