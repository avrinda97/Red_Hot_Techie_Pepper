2012-07-01T23:28:00.000Z	nicecrew		Can anyone help?
2012-07-01T23:28:00.000Z	nicecrew		I burned the ubuntu iso to a disc and now am having trouble getting it to run on my macbook.
2012-07-01T23:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nicecrew	did you MD5 test the ISO you downloaded and did you burn as slowly as possible?
2012-07-01T23:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nicecrew	there is an MD5 tester for mac
2012-07-01T23:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nicecrew	ubottu is also a bot ;)
2012-07-01T23:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nicecrew	the MD5 tests the ISO you used is complete and consistent
2012-07-01T23:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nicecrew	read the link ubottu gave, thats what it's for. why do you think I triggered it...
2012-07-01T23:33:00.000Z	nicecrew	ActionParsnip	That's windows MD5 instructions. I need mac ones.
2012-07-01T23:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nicecrew	on http://help.ubuntu.com/community/HowToMD5SUM which is in ubotttu's link, read te right hand side
2012-07-01T23:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nicecrew	3 MD5SUM on Mac OS X
2012-07-01T23:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nicecrew	that is how to MD5 test in mac
2012-07-01T23:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nicecrew	had you clicked the link, you'd have seen that
2012-07-01T23:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nicecrew	did you even click the link
2012-07-01T23:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nicecrew	it's there, clear as day..
2012-07-01T23:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nicecrew	so why the "That's windows MD5 instructions." when it clearly states Mac?
2012-07-01T23:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nicecrew	isn't there the md5sum command in the terminal?
2012-07-01T23:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nicecrew	what model mac do you have please
