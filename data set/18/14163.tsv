2005-09-13T07:40:00.000Z	BlueEagle	h17m4n	It's pretty identical to windows XPs partitioning tool isn't it?
2005-09-13T07:44:00.000Z	BlueEagle	h17m4n	Actually, this happened to me when guiding two noobs trough the install. I was typing down like five lines on how to partition, and just as I pressed enter they wrote to me: "Ok, I've made a /boot 100 mb, /home 15GB and a / partition. Is that OK?" and I really could not disagree.
2005-09-13T07:45:00.000Z	BlueEagle	h17m4n	Well, actually the one only made a 10GB home, but that's not really the point.
2005-09-13T07:47:00.000Z	BlueEagle	h17m4n	You don't need more than one / partition, however I recomend having a /boot and a /home aswell. If you ever want to try a different distro you can use the same kernel (in all but a few cases) and you keep user settings.
2005-09-13T07:48:00.000Z	h17m4n	BlueEagle	What is the boot one for?
2005-09-13T07:48:00.000Z	BlueEagle	h17m4n	That will keep your kernel safe (if and when you roll your own) between distro installations.
2005-09-13T07:50:00.000Z	h17m4n	BlueEagle	and could be just 100 megs? It'd be better having it before the ext3 one right?
2005-09-13T07:51:00.000Z	BlueEagle	h17m4n	100 mb is plenty. It doesn't matter where it is unless you are using old hardware. I always put /boot on /dev/sda1 (hd0,0)
2005-09-13T07:53:00.000Z	BlueEagle	h17m4n	Well, move what's in /boot now to ie. /boot.bacup and mount the new partition to /boot and move the stuff back.
2005-09-13T07:54:00.000Z	h17m4n	BlueEagle	cool thanks
2005-09-13T07:54:00.000Z	BlueEagle	h17m4n	Also remember to setup your /etc/fstab and your /boot/grub.conf and run grub to update the bootloader with the new location of the bootloader files.
