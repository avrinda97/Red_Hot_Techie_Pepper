2005-09-05T16:42:00.000Z	stoeptegel		 i'am having problems with reading acces in some partitions, it give me: mount: could not find /dev/sbd5 in /etc/fstab/ or /etc/mtab.  Could someone give me a hint?
2005-09-05T16:44:00.000Z	fluvvell	stoeptegel	sounds like a usb drive or something?
2005-09-05T16:46:00.000Z	stoeptegel	fluvvell	no sata disks
2005-09-05T16:47:00.000Z	fluvvell	stoeptegel	were they added since you installed ubuntu, or during setup
2005-09-05T16:49:00.000Z	fluvvell	stoeptegel	can you mount the drive manually?
2005-09-05T16:50:00.000Z	fluvvell	stoeptegel	eg mount /dev/sdb5 /media/spare  (or some other empty folder)
2005-09-05T16:50:00.000Z	stoeptegel	fluvvell	trying...
2005-09-05T16:55:00.000Z	stoeptegel	fluvvell	when i open the mounted map i get:  could not open /media/spare
2005-09-05T16:57:00.000Z	fluvvell	stoeptegel	you need to create the directory first.  Where did you want to have it mounted anyway?
2005-09-05T16:59:00.000Z	stoeptegel	fluvvell	in /media
2005-09-05T16:59:00.000Z	fluvvell	stoeptegel	yeah, but you'll need a folder underneath media
2005-09-05T05:00:00.000Z	fluvvell	stoeptegel	fair enough, is the partition blank, or is there something on it already?
2005-09-05T05:01:00.000Z	stoeptegel	fluvvell	it's full with stuff
2005-09-05T05:02:00.000Z	fluvvell	stoeptegel	well, mkdir /media/stuff    then mount it with         mount /dev/sdb5 /media/stuff
2005-09-05T05:04:00.000Z	stoeptegel	fluvvell	same could not open /media/stuff
2005-09-05T05:06:00.000Z	stoeptegel	fluvvell	the rights are far less then other drives though
2005-09-05T05:11:00.000Z	stoeptegel	fluvvell	i got it working now, thank you! :)   Is there a way to automount one or more partition from boot?
2005-09-05T05:12:00.000Z	fluvvell	stoeptegel	you can edit the fstab to mount the partition on boot
