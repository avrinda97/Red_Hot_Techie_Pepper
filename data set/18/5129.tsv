2011-06-02T18:44:00.000Z	SAngeli		openssh-server and client are installed. Process is available too.
2011-06-02T18:44:00.000Z	SAngeli		I just get connection refused. I connect over LAN
2011-06-02T18:45:00.000Z	SAngeli		I do not see my firewall (as I assume I have to customize it) as am unable to find the gui in gnome menu
2011-06-02T18:46:00.000Z	SAngeli		I get this error: ssh: connect to host 192.168.0.120 port 22: Connection refused
2011-06-02T18:47:00.000Z	SAngeli		I am sure it has to do with firewall.
2011-06-02T18:48:00.000Z	SAngeli		ALL I HAVE TO DO is stop firewall service for first time. How to do so? /etc/init.d/ ??
2011-06-02T18:48:00.000Z	qin	SAngeli	Is your ssh server running, on server: sudo netstat -tulp
2011-06-02T18:50:00.000Z	qin	SAngeli	iptables
2011-06-02T18:52:00.000Z	SAngeli	qin	I do not have in /etc/init.d iptables
2011-06-02T18:53:00.000Z	qin	SAngeli	1. on server: sudo netstat -tulp (to see if ssh server works), 2. sudo service iptables stop
2011-06-02T18:54:00.000Z	qin	SAngeli	firestarter?
2011-06-02T18:54:00.000Z	SAngeli	qin	I do /etc/init.d/<WHAT DO i WRINTE HERE?>
2011-06-02T18:58:00.000Z	qin	SAngeli	Sudo apt-get install openssh-server
2011-06-02T18:59:00.000Z	qin	SAngeli	!!!!!!
2011-06-02T18:59:00.000Z	qin	SAngeli	sudo service ssh start
2011-06-02T18:59:00.000Z	qin	SAngeli	(it is server)
2011-06-02T19:01:00.000Z	qin	SAngeli	THEN (on server): sudo netstat -tulp (to see if ssh is listing on port 22 and what ip, should be: *:22)
2011-06-02T19:02:00.000Z	qin	SAngeli	Now you know ;)
