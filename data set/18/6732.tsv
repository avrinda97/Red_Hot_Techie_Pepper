2008-04-03T17:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gooody	not that much. if your system is 4 years old or younger its fine
2008-04-03T17:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gooody	you'll need to either look at it physically or find out in the operating system
2008-04-03T17:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gooody	should be ok
2008-04-03T17:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gooody	make sure you have graphics drivers installed. Should be ok but not whizzy. you could upgrade the vga to a cheapo nvidia and be fine :)
2008-04-03T17:26:00.000Z	gooody	ActionParsnip	i only have onboard graphics card.
