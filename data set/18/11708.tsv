2006-07-11T11:20:00.000Z	MrData	garryF	Good to hear. I can't seem to find any proof of this by research, I guess I can't find it because it's not data critical.
2006-07-11T11:21:00.000Z	garryF		say MrData yes. There is a way to resize partions using various editors but I'm told that you have to use a boot disk and reintalll lilo or grub again.
2006-07-11T11:21:00.000Z	garryF	MrData	and there is a way to make a swap file but I dunno how in linux.'
2006-07-11T11:22:00.000Z	MrData		Well, OK, but what if my RAM is also very full? That could be a big problem, right? And, it's full with programs, not just cache.
2006-07-11T11:23:00.000Z	garryF	MrData	 How much ram do you have and what is size of swap?
2006-07-11T11:24:00.000Z	MrData	garryF	515MB RAM and 650 MB swap.
2006-07-11T11:24:00.000Z	MrData		I'm just browsing the Web, but I have lots of windows with lots of tabs.
2006-07-11T11:25:00.000Z	garryF	MrData	 Yeah, I'd try to increase that swap size by resizing partions but finding out how to reinstall grub after. There's a helpful site to be found googling grubfarm
