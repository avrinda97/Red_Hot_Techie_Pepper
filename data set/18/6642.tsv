2008-05-16T23:33:00.000Z	Bert_2	lastelement0	have you checked alsamixer ?
2008-05-16T23:33:00.000Z	lastelement0	Bert_2	yes
2008-05-16T23:33:00.000Z	Bert_2	lastelement0	you're sure that both speakers work, have you already tried a headphone ?
2008-05-16T23:34:00.000Z	lastelement0	Bert_2	thats the thing, no matter what i use i only get audio from the left side.
2008-05-16T23:34:00.000Z	Bert_2	lastelement0	have you already tried switching between mono and stereo in alsamixer ?
2008-05-16T23:35:00.000Z	lastelement0	Bert_2	how would i do that i don't think im aware of how one would switch that
2008-05-16T23:35:00.000Z	Bert_2	lastelement0	give me 2 min. I'll check it
2008-05-16T23:35:00.000Z	lastelement0	Bert_2	thank you
2008-05-16T23:36:00.000Z	Bert_2	lastelement0	if you open alsamixer (you know, open a terminal and typ alsamixer) go to the right and there you find an option "mono", press M to make it active and then check
2008-05-16T23:37:00.000Z	Bert_2	lastelement0	also, the gentoo wiki is not a reference for ubuntu
2008-05-16T23:38:00.000Z	Bert_2	lastelement0	are you okey ?
2008-05-16T23:39:00.000Z	Bert_2	lastelement0	are you on the mono option or on another one ?
2008-05-16T23:41:00.000Z	Bert_2	lastelement0	that's very very strange, I need to check some stuff to give you an answer, give me 5 min. okey ?
2008-05-16T23:43:00.000Z	Bert_2	lastelement0	you can toggle a channel with , and . or with < and >
2008-05-16T23:44:00.000Z	Bert_2	lastelement0	did it work ?
2008-05-16T23:45:00.000Z	Bert_2	lastelement0	great, now sorry that it had to be done in such an unfriendly way, ubuntu is all about an easy user-experience so we try to minimise the need for this "command line" stuff
2008-05-16T23:46:00.000Z	Bert_2	lastelement0	well, I was too, I just did man alsamixer and it was in there somewhere ;) :p
