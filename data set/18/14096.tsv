2008-02-13T09:06:00.000Z	Flannel	Shrugz	Use evolution.  It's the ltitle mail icon on the top of your screen (in the middle of the three)
2008-02-13T09:12:00.000Z	Flannel	Shrugz	You want to host your own mail, on your home box, so you can connect (to your home box) and get your email?
2008-02-13T09:13:00.000Z	Flannel	Shrugz	Or you want to connect to your ISPs (whatever) POP and SMTP servers with an email client?
2008-02-13T09:13:00.000Z	Flannel	Shrugz	Right.  So, you want a central mail repository, that grab sstuff from various POP sources
2008-02-13T09:15:00.000Z	Flannel	Shrugz	Outlook is just a mail client, if I have all my mail on outlook on box A, can I view that mail on box B?
2008-02-13T09:16:00.000Z	Flannel	Shrugz	you need a mail client?  or you want to view your mail (stored on box A) from box B?
2008-02-13T09:17:00.000Z	Flannel	Shrugz	right, thats just a regular mail client.  Evolution will work fine for you.
2008-02-13T09:18:00.000Z	Flannel	Shrugz	What about it doesn't work for you?  "It doesn't work" doesn't tell us a whole lot about whats going wrong
2008-02-13T09:20:00.000Z	Flannel	Shrugz	alright, well, we'll be happy to help you diagnose it.  If you're looking for non-evolution alternatives, there are plenty.  One that comes to mind is Thunderbird
2008-03-07T06:24:00.000Z	Flannel	Shrugz	dpkg -l (lower case l)
2008-03-07T06:25:00.000Z	Flannel	Shrugz	yes
2008-03-07T06:25:00.000Z	Flannel	Shrugz	Or like bloody` said, run synaptic and you can browse them
2008-03-07T06:26:00.000Z	Flannel	Shrugz	you can sort by different things in synaptic, if you sort by installed packages, it'll show you them
