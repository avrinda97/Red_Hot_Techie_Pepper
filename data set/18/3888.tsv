2010-03-17T03:54:00.000Z	yezid		hello i would liketo add space to my ubuntu partition any help appreciated, thanks
2010-03-17T03:54:00.000Z	Jordan_U	yezid	Boot from a liveCD and resize the partition with gparted.
2010-03-17T03:59:00.000Z	Jordan_U	yezid	Are you using grub2?
2010-03-17T03:59:00.000Z	yezid	Jordan_U	 idk how do i check
2010-03-17T04:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U	yezid	grub-install --version
2010-03-17T04:01:00.000Z	yezid	Jordan_U	 grub-install (GNU GRUB 0.97)
2010-03-17T04:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	yezid	Then you'll have to go buy some blank CDs ( or upgrade to GRUB2 :)
2010-03-17T04:03:00.000Z	yezid	Jordan_U	 how do i upgrade
2010-03-17T04:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	yezid	I didn't realize you were running 9.04, you probably don't want to upgrade to grub2 before upgrading to 9.10.
2010-03-17T04:05:00.000Z	yezid	Jordan_U	 ok then it wonl let me upgrade because i need disk space but i dont have blank cds or flash drive so can i just use gparted and apply after restart or something
2010-03-17T04:06:00.000Z	Jordan_U	yezid	You will need to upgrade to 9.10, upgrade to grub2, download the parted magic liveCD, and modify /etc/grub.d/40_custom to add an entry to boot from the parted magic iso. Are you sure you can do all that without running out of space first?
2010-03-17T04:07:00.000Z	yezid	Jordan_U	 i have not enough space and no blank cds
2010-03-17T04:08:00.000Z	Jordan_U	yezid	What is currently using the space that you would resize the Ubuntu partition into?
2010-03-17T04:09:00.000Z	yezid	Jordan_U	 i selected about only 10gb at the first install...
2010-03-17T04:10:00.000Z	Jordan_U	yezid	And the rest is free space?
2010-03-17T04:10:00.000Z	yezid	Jordan_U	 no i dont know this is my couzings computer but i think its just installed aplications
2010-03-17T04:11:00.000Z	Jordan_U	yezid	To resize the Ubuntu partition you need free space to resize it into.
2010-03-17T04:11:00.000Z	yezid	Jordan_U	the windows aprtition has like 60 gb
