2007-08-26T16:48:00.000Z	mikubuntu		johto: is there a channel particularly dedicated to using ubuntu's open office programs?
2007-08-26T16:49:00.000Z	mikubuntu		can anyone tell me how to convert an ubuntu open office document (flyer) to jpeg, for printing and for web publishing?

2007-08-26T09:49:00.000Z	magnetron	mikubuntu	you can print it without converting it to jpeg. why not use the PDF export button? PDFs are easy to print and perfect for the web
2007-08-26T09:51:00.000Z	mikubuntu	magnetron	guess i need to check if craigslist will take pdf
2007-08-26T09:52:00.000Z	magnetron	mikubuntu	you could do a screenshot (alt+printscreen) and convert it to jpg with GIMP
2007-08-26T09:53:00.000Z	mikubuntu	magnetron	i don't understand; you mean (alt + P)?
2007-08-26T09:53:00.000Z	magnetron	mikubuntu	beware, all files except photos will look blurry in jpg format. no, the Prt Scr button
2007-08-26T09:54:00.000Z	mikubuntu	magnetron	omg, that's the first time i ever SAW that button ... lol
2007-08-26T09:55:00.000Z	mikubuntu	magnetron	ok, so what's the best format to preserve resolution/continuity?
2007-08-26T09:56:00.000Z	magnetron	mikubuntu	best format would be Open Document Format. in descending order: HTML, PDF, PNG, GIF, JPEG
2007-08-26T09:58:00.000Z	mikubuntu	magnetron	so do a file--->export to opendoc, from html to jpeg, whichever works for me?
2007-08-26T09:58:00.000Z	magnetron	mikubuntu	yeap
2007-08-26T10:01:00.000Z	mikubuntu	magnetron	this was my first time using open office, as soon as i figure all these things out i already love it.  Tell me, i prolly could have done the whole thing in GIMP, also, right?  just a picture with superimposed text ...?
2007-08-26T10:02:00.000Z	magnetron	mikubuntu	well GIMP is nice and can solve most problems, but i don't think it can read the Open Document Format
2007-08-26T10:03:00.000Z	mikubuntu	magnetron	my question is, couldn't i have done the whole project with gimp INSTEAD of openoffice?
2007-08-26T10:04:00.000Z	magnetron	mikubuntu	ofcourse, whatever suits your needs. also, Scribus is great for desktop publishing (flyers etc)
2007-08-26T10:05:00.000Z	mikubuntu	magnetron	ya, gotta familiarize myself with all of them.  well, thanks again for your help, gonna go back to work on it.
