2009-03-21T13:45:00.000Z	nyad		hi. I want to host online games, but it appears as though a firewall is blocking me, in ubuntu 8.04 I had no problems, but something in 8.10 is stopping me
2009-03-21T13:46:00.000Z	nyad		Is there a way I can disable this firewall thingy?
2009-03-21T13:46:00.000Z	user___	nyad	maybe ufw disable
2009-03-21T13:49:00.000Z	nyad	user___	I turned off ufw and it doesn't change anything. perhaps IP forwarding is disabled in kernel?
2009-03-21T13:50:00.000Z	user___	nyad	hmm, what does 'ufw status' say?
2009-03-21T13:51:00.000Z	nyad	user___	 Status: not loaded  (this is after $ sudo ufw disable)
2009-03-21T13:52:00.000Z	user___	nyad	i dont understand how ip-forwarding comes into play.. you wanted to disable the firewall and now it is disabled?
2009-03-21T13:54:00.000Z	nyad	user___	I want to play online games, everything worked in 8.04 but in 8.10 it behaves as though it was a firewall blocking, people can see my game but cant join, (I have forwarded router ports etc)
2009-03-21T13:55:00.000Z	user___	nyad	ok
2009-03-21T13:58:00.000Z	nyad	user___	no ideas as to what changed in 8.10 that could be affecting me?
2009-03-21T13:58:00.000Z	user___	nyad	what does 'sudo iptables --list' output?
2009-03-21T14:00:00.000Z	nyad	user___	Chain INPUT (policy ACCEPT)      and all the others have policy ACCEPT, target     prot opt source      destination   fields are empty
2009-03-21T14:00:00.000Z	user___	nyad	ok, no firewall active (ufw is a comfort layer on top of iptables)
2009-03-21T14:01:00.000Z	user___	nyad	let me check if theres a ubuntu network channel
2009-03-21T14:03:00.000Z	user___	nyad	you might try #ubuntu-server: they are more into networks than us
2009-03-21T14:03:00.000Z	nyad	user___	ok, thanks for your time
2009-03-21T14:03:00.000Z	user___	nyad	sure ,-)
2009-03-21T14:03:00.000Z	user___	nyad	sure ;-)
