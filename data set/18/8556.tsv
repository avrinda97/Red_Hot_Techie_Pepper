2008-07-10T09:41:00.000Z	Soulwarp	Shak-	you may want to read the guide a bit further for the trouble shooting
2008-07-10T09:41:00.000Z	Soulwarp	Shak-	there is a file you must edit if you want to enable hardware acceleration
2008-07-10T09:44:00.000Z	Shak-	Soulwarp	I suppose you're referring to xorg.conf? I've edited to match the correct settings, but what I think i'm missing is nvidia-glx-new for my new kernel
2008-07-10T09:46:00.000Z	Soulwarp	Shak-	which one are you using now?
2008-07-10T09:46:00.000Z	Soulwarp	Shak-	new?
2008-07-10T09:47:00.000Z	Shak-	Soulwarp	kernel 2.6.25
2008-07-10T09:47:00.000Z	Soulwarp	Shak-	i mean the graphics driver
2008-07-10T09:48:00.000Z	Shak-	Soulwarp	169.12
2008-07-10T09:48:00.000Z	Soulwarp	Shak-	did you download the binary driver nvidia-glx?
2008-07-10T09:49:00.000Z	Shak-	Soulwarp	yes its there, remember this was all was working until I updated my kernel from 2.6.24 to 2.6.25
2008-07-10T09:50:00.000Z	Soulwarp	Shak-	i would reboot the computer then
2008-07-10T09:50:00.000Z	Soulwarp	Shak-	to reload the system
2008-07-10T09:51:00.000Z	Shak-	Soulwarp	wouldn't restarting X be sufficient, but I still dont see how thats taking care of the problem because in synaptic my nvidia-glx-new is 169.12+2.6.24.13-1, and 2.6.25 isn't listed there
2008-07-10T09:52:00.000Z	Soulwarp	Shak-	your system is still running on the old kernel it seems, rebooting the system will start your new one
2008-07-10T09:52:00.000Z	Shak-	Soulwarp	even if uname -a says 2.6.25?
2008-07-10T09:54:00.000Z	Soulwarp	Shak-	i admit im no pro at tech support but if i have a problem with my kernel i reboot
2008-07-10T09:54:00.000Z	Soulwarp	Shak-	if you wish you can restate your problem so someone else can help you
2008-07-10T09:54:00.000Z	Shak-	Soulwarp	ok
