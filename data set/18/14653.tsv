2005-07-18T13:12:00.000Z	str		Hi all...
2005-07-18T13:12:00.000Z	str		I have a quiestion about the repositories...
2005-07-18T13:13:00.000Z	str		is the same to have one line with:
2005-07-18T13:13:00.000Z	str		deb http://gt.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu hoary universe
2005-07-18T13:14:00.000Z	str		than 2 lines  one with hoary, and one with univers?
2005-07-18T13:16:00.000Z	FlannelKing	str	you need hoary and universe on the same line, one indicates version (hoary, as opposed to breezy or warty) and then the repos (universe)
2005-07-18T13:17:00.000Z	str	FlannelKing	but do I need to have "hoary universe" and  "hoary multiverse" and "main restricted" in diferent lines?   or can I join them in one line?
2005-07-18T13:19:00.000Z	FlannelKing	str	you can have them on the same line, well, itd be "hoary universe multiverse restricted", but you might as well have them on different lines (so you can comment them out easier)
2005-07-18T13:20:00.000Z	str	FlannelKing	so... it is ok to have  one line like this:     deb http://gt.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu hoary main restricted universe multiverse
2005-07-18T13:21:00.000Z	str	FlannelKing	and there i should have everything, exept the backports... right?
2005-07-18T13:21:00.000Z	FlannelKing	str	for hoary, not security or updates, but yes
2005-07-18T13:22:00.000Z	str	FlannelKing	for securitys i nedd only this...deb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu hoary-security main restricted      <<--- Right?
2005-07-18T13:23:00.000Z	FlannelKing	str	I believe thats the syntax, you might also want universe
2005-07-18T13:23:00.000Z	str	FlannelKing	 for hoary, not security or updates, but yes   <-- what do you mean with "updates" ?
2005-07-18T13:24:00.000Z	FlannelKing	str	as in, hoary-updates
2005-07-18T13:24:00.000Z	str	FlannelKing	so.. this should be THE  line, right?    deb http://gt.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu hoary hoary-updates main restricted universe multiverse
2005-07-18T13:25:00.000Z	FlannelKing	str	no, give the updates their own line, and it'll ONLY be main and restricted
