2007-07-24T16:36:00.000Z	bruenig		hp is very linux friendly, I buy as much as I can from them
2007-07-24T16:38:00.000Z	bruenig		hp laptop, hp (technically compaq) desktop, and hp printer, all work swell
2007-07-24T16:39:00.000Z	YANP	bruenig	will never buy hp again
2007-07-24T16:39:00.000Z	bruenig	YANP	I bet the error is on your end
2007-07-24T16:40:00.000Z	YANP	bruenig	I no dont think so all I did was install GW and play it for 3 days straight and go on myspace
2007-07-24T16:46:00.000Z	bruenig	YANP	try to run it with -dao
2007-07-24T16:46:00.000Z	bruenig	YANP	yes
2007-07-24T16:49:00.000Z	bruenig	YANP	hopefully just one line
2007-07-24T16:50:00.000Z	bruenig	YANP	ok where you were doing dev=/dev/sr0, instead do dev=/dev/scd0
2007-07-24T16:52:00.000Z	bruenig	YANP	is the drive making noise?
2007-07-24T16:52:00.000Z	YANP	bruenig	um..nope..
2007-07-24T16:53:00.000Z	YANP	bruenig	it is not even doing little orange blinks
2007-07-24T05:00:00.000Z	bruenig	YANP	hardware failure or bad iso is the only thing I can think of, the error doesn't really tell much
2007-07-24T05:30:00.000Z	bruenig	YANP	you get them from launchpad for free
2007-07-24T05:31:00.000Z	bruenig	YANP	because people like you buy them I guess
2007-07-24T05:31:00.000Z	YANP	bruenig	link to free amd ubuntu cd?
2007-07-24T05:31:00.000Z	bruenig	YANP	just look on launchpad
2007-07-24T05:33:00.000Z	bruenig	YANP	oh nevermind it is shipit, https://shipit.ubuntu.com/
