2010-02-22T08:58:00.000Z	bugaloo		hi guys... does anybody know how can I configure the multimedia keys on sony vaio (ubuntu 9.10)?
2010-02-22T08:58:00.000Z	albech	bugaloo	i gave up on that long ago.. seems like a pain
2010-02-22T08:59:00.000Z	bugaloo	albech	:(   I have a HP Pavilion and it works fine
2010-02-22T08:59:00.000Z	albech	bugaloo	there is some vaio kernel module that should enable them, but sony isnt very informative about their hardware, so writing stuff for it seems to be a pain
2010-02-22T08:59:00.000Z	bugaloo	albech	i see
2010-02-22T08:59:00.000Z	albech	bugaloo	even light control doesnt work on mine :(
2010-02-22T09:00:00.000Z	bugaloo	albech	too bad hear this :(
2010-02-22T09:00:00.000Z	albech	bugaloo	yet ubuntu is running fine and i can live without
2010-02-22T09:00:00.000Z	albech	bugaloo	have a look at this site: http://www.linux-laptop.net/sony.html
2010-02-22T09:01:00.000Z	bugaloo	albech	sure... but I'm trying to make everything works because is a new laptop :)
2010-02-22T09:01:00.000Z	bugaloo	albech	I tried this site, but there is no my model
2010-02-22T09:04:00.000Z	albech	bugaloo	hang on a sec.. i am checking something with the kernel module
2010-02-22T09:06:00.000Z	albech	bugaloo	is the sony_laptop module loaded? lsmod | grep "sony"
2010-02-22T09:06:00.000Z	bugaloo	albech	let me check
2010-02-22T09:09:00.000Z	bugaloo	albech	sorry my late
