2009-03-22T09:44:00.000Z	ziroday	Zallik	exact error message?
2009-03-22T09:46:00.000Z	ziroday	Zallik	err does your /etc/X11 dir exist?
2009-03-22T09:49:00.000Z	ziroday	Zallik	okay, you sure that is the exact error message?
2009-03-22T09:50:00.000Z	ziroday	Zallik	I will _not_ help you in PM. Please keep it in the main channel.
2009-03-22T09:52:00.000Z	ziroday	Zallik	err are you using ubuntu?
2009-03-22T09:52:00.000Z	ziroday	Zallik	lsb_release -a
2009-03-22T09:53:00.000Z	ziroday	Zallik	nope, you are running ubuntu. How are you logged in as root and why?
2009-03-22T09:55:00.000Z	ziroday	Zallik	err okay. Well root is not really supported here. Try doing startx or /etc/init.d/gdm start
2009-03-22T09:58:00.000Z	ziroday	Zallik	try typing in startx
2009-03-22T09:59:00.000Z	ziroday	Zallik	and you just typed in startx correct?
2009-03-22T09:59:00.000Z	ziroday	Zallik	lower case
2009-03-22T10:00:00.000Z	ziroday	Zallik	what version of ubuntu did you install? Desktop?
2009-03-22T10:01:00.000Z	ziroday	Zallik	I believe you need to reinstall. Futhermore running as root is dangerous. And ssh won't display graphical apps unless you enable X forwarding by doing ssh -X but it will still be _very very_ slow
2009-03-22T10:02:00.000Z	Zallik	ziroday	thats why i want to use X to view it
2009-03-22T10:02:00.000Z	ziroday	Zallik	X to view what?
2009-03-22T10:03:00.000Z	ziroday	Zallik	it doesn't work like that. I strongly recommend a reinstall. Plus you won't get any x forwarding anyway unless you ssh in with ssh -X
