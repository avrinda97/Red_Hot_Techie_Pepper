2010-05-20T05:29:00.000Z	Valenza		Question.. what's 'super-user' mean in terminal?
2010-05-20T05:29:00.000Z	Valenza		had something pop up saying "you should run this program as 'super-user'
2010-05-20T05:31:00.000Z	Valenza		got it to work.. figured that since I already entered in my sudo password... didn't need to type sudo anymore
2010-05-20T05:31:00.000Z	Valenza		now if anyone can help me figure out why my lan and wlan are both disabled... please pm me :)
2010-05-20T05:32:00.000Z	Valenza		lol thats what I just did
2010-05-20T05:34:00.000Z	Valenza		which is why it said superuser.. both are disabled. and I can't find my nm-system-settings.conf file (search doesn't find it and terminal says /etc/NetworkManager/nm-system-settings.conf 'no such file')
2010-05-20T05:36:00.000Z	Valenza		does ect/networkmanager folder show up in your filesystem window?
2010-05-20T05:36:00.000Z	Valenza		I have mine set to show hidden files as well... and there is no folder

2010-05-20T05:52:00.000Z	edbian	Valenza	Is the only reason you don't have internet because of the network manager isn't working?
2010-05-20T05:53:00.000Z	edbian	Valenza	what shows up in sudo ifconfig -a  ?
2010-05-20T05:54:00.000Z	edbian	Valenza	Do you see your eth0 or something?  Are you using wired or wireless internet?
2010-05-20T05:55:00.000Z	edbian	Valenza	Do you have wlan0 in the output of sudo ifconfig -a  ?
2010-05-20T05:56:00.000Z	edbian	Valenza	Use "ip addr"  does wlan0 have an ip address?  It should say "inet xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx"  do you see that?
2010-05-20T05:57:00.000Z	edbian	Valenza	It is good that you have a wlan0 that means ubuntu recognized your wifi and found a driver for it.  Now it's just a matter of getting it connected to a wireless network.
2010-05-20T05:57:00.000Z	edbian	Valenza	Can you pastebin your /etc/network/interfaces  file?
2010-05-20T05:58:00.000Z	edbian	Valenza	No worries.  Can you see the file?  What entires are there?  You can PM me if it's a lot.
2010-05-20T06:00:00.000Z	edbian	Valenza	Here is what mine looks like: http://pastebin.com/hduHpx4N
