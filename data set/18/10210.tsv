2007-02-17T07:21:00.000Z	xtknight	praveer_fedora	it's the ALC202A chipset.  i think alsa may support it, but i'm not sure
2007-02-17T07:22:00.000Z	xtknight	praveer_fedora	it should work in the latest alsa with the intel 8x0 driver
2007-02-17T07:23:00.000Z	praveer_fedora	xtknight	how to change driver from oss to alsa in ubuntu AFAIK i am right on question
2007-02-17T07:23:00.000Z	xtknight	praveer_fedora	what does this command report: "asoundconf list" ?
2007-02-17T07:24:00.000Z	praveer_fedora	xtknight	ICH5
2007-02-17T07:25:00.000Z	xtknight	praveer_fedora	are you in ubuntu or fedora now?
2007-02-17T07:25:00.000Z	praveer_fedora	xtknight	i am helping a friend who is on ubuntu, i am on fedora
2007-02-17T07:25:00.000Z	praveer_fedora	xtknight	i am thinking of invitng him here
2007-02-17T07:25:00.000Z	xtknight	praveer_fedora	ah and he typed asoundconf, not you, right?
2007-02-17T07:26:00.000Z	praveer_fedora	xtknight	yup
2007-02-17T07:26:00.000Z	xtknight	praveer_fedora	well it looks like his card is detected.  have him type "sudo lshw -class sound | grep driver="
2007-02-17T07:29:00.000Z	praveer_fedora	xtknight	configuration: driver=Intel ICH        <---sudo lshw -class sound | grep driver=
2007-02-17T07:31:00.000Z	xtknight	praveer_fedora	hmm ok, what about "lsmod | grep intel8x0"
2007-02-17T07:33:00.000Z	praveer_fedora	xtknight	http://pastebin.ca/360430
2007-02-17T07:34:00.000Z	xtknight	praveer_fedora	ok.  well his card should be working.  there might be a switch in the mixer he needs to check (like analog/digital output) to get it to work properly.  other than that, it's detected by ubuntu and the driver has been loaded
2007-02-17T07:34:00.000Z	praveer_fedora	xtknight	ok,
2007-02-17T07:35:00.000Z	xtknight	praveer_fedora	type 'gnome-volume-control' and go to the Switches tab.  try switching on/off the options till the sound works
2007-02-17T07:36:00.000Z	praveer_fedora	xtknight	yes, ty, i am trying that
