2008-06-22T14:37:00.000Z	conb123		hi im having some trouble installing a program it was only avalible in source code format so i had to compile install it. Here is the contents of what i can tell from the errors is the offending file http://rafb.net/p/3ZgHYb54.html and here are the errors recieved when compiling http://rafb.net/p/RmWfCg51.html. Im fairly new to linux so sorry if this problem is really stupid
2008-06-22T14:38:00.000Z	gordonjcp	conb123	what are you trying to build?
2008-06-22T14:38:00.000Z	conb123	gordonjcp	a nes emulator called tuxnes
2008-06-22T14:39:00.000Z	gordonjcp	conb123	can you paste the url?
2008-06-22T14:40:00.000Z	gordonjcp	conb123	give me a sec and I'll try and duplicate the problem
2008-06-22T14:40:00.000Z	gordonjcp	conb123	actually, doing a quick google for tuxnes, it looks like it hasn't been updated in seven years...
2008-06-22T14:41:00.000Z	gordonjcp	conb123	isn't there a nes emulator in the repos?
2008-06-22T14:41:00.000Z	conb123	gordonjcp	oh right well ill try another nes emu is there any you reccomend
2008-06-22T14:42:00.000Z	conb123	gordonjcp	yes there is but it emulates in a tiny window
2008-06-22T14:42:00.000Z	gordonjcp	conb123	hm
2008-06-22T14:42:00.000Z	gordonjcp	conb123	which one is that?
2008-06-22T14:43:00.000Z	conb123	gordonjcp	i think its called nestra
2008-06-22T14:52:00.000Z	gordonjcp	conb123	I've got that thing to compile, whether it works or not is another story
2008-06-22T14:54:00.000Z	gordonjcp	conb123	so far if you comment out the "perror" lines and replace them with "printf("some message\n");" it compiles
2008-06-22T15:01:00.000Z	conb123	gordonjcp	ok thanks but i have a new problem im trying a new emu but it says its not there what could be causing this http://i27.tinypic.com/10ylxys.jpg
2008-06-22T15:06:00.000Z	gordonjcp	conb123	weird
2008-06-22T15:07:00.000Z	gordonjcp	conb123	is it possible that the fwnes file in your directory there is really a script, with a path to something that doesn't exist?
2008-06-22T15:07:00.000Z	conb123	gordonjcp	yes it could be ill check it out
