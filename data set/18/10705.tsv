2006-12-22T15:45:00.000Z	reverseblade	MrSprout	what is your computer's brand ?
2006-12-22T15:46:00.000Z	reverseblade	MrSprout	how do you know it uses 1 proc ?
2006-12-22T15:47:00.000Z	reverseblade	MrSprout	I have also 2 processors let me try it
2006-12-22T15:48:00.000Z	reverseblade	MrSprout	that also outputs 1 for me
2006-12-22T15:48:00.000Z	reverseblade	MrSprout	that output is just fine
2006-12-22T15:50:00.000Z	reverseblade	MrSprout	I am assure that output is nothing abnormal for 2 cpus
2006-12-22T15:52:00.000Z	reverseblade	MrSprout	I can suggest you a rough way. It does not guarantee but it gives you an idea. Try glxgears -printfps, and tell me what output do you get
2006-12-22T15:52:00.000Z	reverseblade	MrSprout	that's true SMP is a must for 2 x proc
2006-12-22T15:53:00.000Z	reverseblade	MrSprout	prolly single cpu
2006-12-22T15:54:00.000Z	reverseblade	MrSprout	how did you installed ubuntu ?
2006-12-22T15:58:00.000Z	reverseblade	MrSprout	it is the only way that kernel runs your 2 cpus symettrically
2006-12-22T15:59:00.000Z	reverseblade	MrSprout	wikipedia: smp
2006-12-22T16:00:00.000Z	reverseblade	MrSprout	as long as you do not have nosmp option in boot options, you should be using smp
