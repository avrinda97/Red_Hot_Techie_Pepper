2006-12-01T09:25:00.000Z	craigbass1976		I can ssh out of it
2006-12-01T09:25:00.000Z	kitche	craigbass1976	ssh isn't installed by default
2006-12-04T10:27:00.000Z	kitche	craigbass1976	fluxbox openbox wmii
2006-12-17T10:26:00.000Z	kitche	craigbass1976	postgresql is closer to sql then mysql is
2006-12-17T10:27:00.000Z	craigbass1976	kitche	ahh balls.  Looks like yet another learnign experience...
2006-12-17T11:02:00.000Z	craigbass1976	kitche	I don't remember either.  I always made a .my.cnf file and had it in there
2006-12-29T09:45:00.000Z	kitche	craigbass1976	that's because you can't open another gui app as another user while anotehr user is on that screen you would have to use another display
2006-12-29T09:45:00.000Z	kitche	craigbass1976	unless you mean from the same screen
2006-12-29T09:45:00.000Z	craigbass1976	kitche	oh, ok
2006-12-29T09:46:00.000Z	craigbass1976	kitche	how do I open another display, or do I have to do the switch user thing?  That's a little XP-ish and I was hoping to avoid that.  So much easier from a terminal...
2006-12-29T09:47:00.000Z	kitche	craigbass1976	only way I know how to is do it from the same screen where your infront of the monitor
2007-01-14T10:16:00.000Z	craigbass1976	kitche	aren't there problems with ff2, or have they been ironed out?
2007-01-14T10:16:00.000Z	kitche	craigbass1976	huh there is no problems with firefox2 well besides some people like 1.5.x
2007-01-20T07:13:00.000Z	kitche	craigbass1976	with vim you need vim-full
2007-01-20T07:16:00.000Z	craigbass1976	kitche	 "Package vim-full has no installation candidate"  it did say that vim-gnome is one of the replacements for it though.  I've insatlled that, but how do I know that's the vim I'm using?
2009-01-09T06:12:00.000Z	kitche	craigbass1976	zip doesn't understand links have to use tar if you want links to be perserved
2009-01-09T06:12:00.000Z	craigbass1976	kitche	bah!  thanks though
