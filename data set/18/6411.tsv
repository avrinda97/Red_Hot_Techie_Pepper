2008-09-04T21:40:00.000Z	chuy_max		hey guys, does installer resize NTFS partition if I don't have available space?
2008-09-04T21:41:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	chuy_max	you want to install Ubuntu?  a dual boot with Windows?
2008-09-04T21:42:00.000Z	chuy_max	SebNaitsabes	yes, but my entire hard disk is NTFS
2008-09-04T21:42:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	chuy_max	yeah Windows only at the moment.  and so one big NTFS partition?
2008-09-04T21:44:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	chuy_max	are you on the Live CD?
2008-09-04T21:44:00.000Z	chuy_max	SebNaitsabes	right
2008-09-04T21:44:00.000Z	chuy_max	SebNaitsabes	no, I have alternate
2008-09-04T21:45:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	chuy_max	the installer can re size your Windows NTFS partition,  however  it's easier to do it your self . well at least on the graphical Live CD with Gparted anyway
2008-09-04T21:45:00.000Z	chuy_max	SebNaitsabes	mmmm, okey, I will need ntfstools anyway
2008-09-04T21:45:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	chuy_max	 what I tend to do if installing Ubuntu psyically is do my partitions with  gnome partition editor myself  and then yeah you tell the installer to install in the partition you just made
2008-09-04T21:46:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	chuy_max	 resizing partitions  using the Live CD  be that gparted or the installer  has  not done damage to Windows for me all those times, but there is a slight chance something could go wrong, so if you got any important data in Windows you should probably back that up first just to be sure
2008-09-04T21:46:00.000Z	chuy_max	SebNaitsabes	I will do that too, the problem is that I don't have the PC, a friend of mine is installing it, and he has only the alternate CD and not an expert on computers
2008-09-04T21:47:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes		!install
2008-09-04T21:47:00.000Z	chuy_max	SebNaitsabes	yeah, I've read that, I've done it once, without loss of data, only windows started doing a check on the hard disk after rebooting
2008-09-04T21:48:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	chuy_max	 what the installing it from Windows thing?
2008-09-04T21:49:00.000Z	chuy_max	SebNaitsabes	you mean wubi?, naaah, its more troublesome. I will just confuse my friend
2008-09-04T21:49:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	chuy_max	 no something else it meant the bot did.
2008-09-04T21:49:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	chuy_max	I don't know if you know this already, but your friend could run Winblows and Ubuntu at the same time
