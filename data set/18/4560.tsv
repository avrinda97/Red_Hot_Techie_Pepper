2009-10-04T05:51:00.000Z	hashbrowns		anyone?  If you cant help directly could you at least help me figure out what would be the most beneficial thing to search for to resolve my problem?
2009-10-04T05:51:00.000Z	iceroot	hashbrowns	post some errors
2009-10-04T05:52:00.000Z	hashbrowns	iceroot	which ones?  My system gets stuck at the (initramfs) prompt I guess it is.
2009-10-04T05:53:00.000Z	iceroot	hashbrowns	can press ctrl + alt + f1 at boot to see some errors?
2009-10-04T05:54:00.000Z	hashbrowns	iceroot	ctrl + alt + f1 did nothing when my system stopped at (initramfs).
2009-10-04T05:56:00.000Z	hashbrowns	iceroot	so what do I do now?
2009-10-04T05:56:00.000Z	iceroot	hashbrowns	that is a good question, i dont know, sorry
2009-10-04T05:57:00.000Z	hashbrowns	iceroot	any ideas as to what I should search around for?
2009-10-04T05:57:00.000Z	iceroot	hashbrowns	your mainboard/notebookname + 2.6.28-15
2009-10-04T06:01:00.000Z	hashbrowns	iceroot	 I get nothing.  Is there a way I could purge the kernel update and try again?
2009-10-04T06:01:00.000Z	iceroot	hashbrowns	just use the 2.6.28-14 grub-entry
2009-10-04T06:01:00.000Z	hashbrowns	iceroot	or possible purge all of the updates that happened last.
2009-10-04T06:01:00.000Z	iceroot	hashbrowns	no
2009-10-04T06:01:00.000Z	hashbrowns	iceroot	how would I do that?
2009-10-04T06:02:00.000Z	hashbrowns	iceroot	just dont use the newer kernel?
2009-10-04T06:02:00.000Z	hashbrowns	iceroot	like hit escape each time and manually select it from the list?
2009-10-04T06:02:00.000Z	iceroot	hashbrowns	just make 2.6.28-14 the deault entry until you found a solution
2009-10-04T06:07:00.000Z	hashbrowns	iceroot	hey whats the difference between marking for removal and marking for complete removal in synaptic?
