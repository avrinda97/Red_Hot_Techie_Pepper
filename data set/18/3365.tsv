2010-02-20T17:26:00.000Z	_Narc_		Hello all. I got a USB key that takes forever to mount, like several minutes, it's FAT formated. Any advice, is it the device or Ubuntu's fault ? Thanks.
2010-02-20T17:26:00.000Z	edeca	_Narc_	Anything in dmesg about it?
2010-02-20T17:26:00.000Z	edeca	_Narc_	If not, it's possibly just the device.  Try scanning the disk on a Windows box or copying your data off and recreating the fat filesystem
2010-02-20T17:27:00.000Z	_Narc_	edeca	Nothing really alarming in dmesg | tail and I already did that, formatting it under Windows
2010-02-20T17:28:00.000Z	edeca	_Narc_	I've had similar when I've yanked them out without "safely ejecting" :)
2010-02-20T17:30:00.000Z	_Narc_	edeca	Ya, I think so too :) But how to fix it now if formatting doesn't help ? Here's my dmesg | tail if you want to take a look - http://paste.ubuntu.com/380335/
2010-02-20T17:30:00.000Z	edeca	_Narc_	That looks totally normal
2010-02-20T17:31:00.000Z	edeca	_Narc_	I would expect to see errors about it settling if the stick was dodgy
2010-02-20T17:32:00.000Z	_Narc_	edeca	I thought so. Yesterday it had a bad superblock alert but I achieved to format but now it takes 5 minutes to automount.
2010-02-20T17:32:00.000Z	edeca	_Narc_	Hrrrrrm, it _could_ be the stick going faulty but fixing itself (they have a small amount of extra storage for bad blocks)
2010-02-20T17:32:00.000Z	edeca	_Narc_	And the host machine would know nothing about it
2010-02-20T17:32:00.000Z	edeca	_Narc_	Time to buy a new stick?  They are less than $10 nowadays ;)
2010-02-20T17:33:00.000Z	_Narc_	edeca	The strange thing is that it's brand new. I bought it yesterday :)
2010-02-20T17:33:00.000Z	edeca	_Narc_	Hrm, that's bad then!
2010-02-20T17:33:00.000Z	_Narc_	edeca	So you think it's a faulty device ?
2010-02-20T17:34:00.000Z	edeca	_Narc_	I dunno, it could be.  That's not normal.  Have you got another machine to try it on?
2010-02-20T17:38:00.000Z	_Narc_	edeca	Ok, I don't get it, it mounts instantly on my older box, also running Karmic. :/
2010-02-20T17:39:00.000Z	edeca	_Narc_	Hm, could either be your hardware or karmic then I guess!
