2007-03-03T12:01:00.000Z	scizzy		ok guys I got a challenge for you... I'm very VERY new to ubuntu (from windows yesterday).  So I am just learning... I finally got my broadcom wireless working with ndiswrapper but I have to continuously open the terminal and type in "sudo depmod -a" and after that "sudo modprobe ndiswrapper" everytime I RESTART my laptop just to get the wireless working?  How can I have my settings saved how they are now so that when I turn it on, it works

2007-03-03T12:07:00.000Z	slavik	scizzy	gentoo you have to compile and stuff
2007-03-03T12:08:00.000Z	slavik	scizzy	in ubuntu, you open synaptic, search for what you need and install, without the need to search for some weird program through google
2007-03-03T12:09:00.000Z	slavik	scizzy	depends on what you need to do
2007-03-03T12:09:00.000Z	slavik	scizzy	ati video card?
2007-03-03T12:10:00.000Z	slavik	scizzy	like I said before, write a script and make it run on boot up or when you login
2007-03-03T12:10:00.000Z	scizzy	slavik	i dont know how to write a script
2007-03-03T12:11:00.000Z	slavik	scizzy	first like is '#!/bin/sh' then every line is a command you do :)
