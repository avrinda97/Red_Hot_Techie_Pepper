2006-03-26T11:34:00.000Z	Eleaf		how do I disable telnet?
2006-03-26T11:35:00.000Z	Eleaf		I'm running ftp on the telnet port and I think telnet is messing with it.
2006-03-26T11:36:00.000Z	Eleaf		yeargh
2006-03-26T11:37:00.000Z	Eleaf		does anybody knows what this means?  227 Entering Passive Mode (192,168,0,2,130,129).
2006-03-26T11:37:00.000Z	Eleaf		         I get that whenever typing 'ls' on my ftp server, it then times out.
2006-03-26T11:37:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Eleaf	means its using passive FTP
2006-03-26T11:37:00.000Z	Eleaf	fyrestrtr	how do I stop that, it seems to always disconnect right after that
2006-03-26T11:40:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Eleaf	seems your FTP server is not using passive mode.
2006-03-26T11:40:00.000Z	Eleaf	fyrestrtr	so why does it go into passive mode when not locally connected ?
2006-03-26T11:40:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Eleaf	passive mode is there if a firewall prevents direct connections to the client PC from the FTP server
2006-03-26T11:40:00.000Z	Eleaf	fyrestrtr	that could be it
2006-03-26T11:41:00.000Z	Eleaf	fyrestrtr	how do I get past this?
2006-03-26T11:41:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Eleaf	I don't know, but use something else like scp
2006-03-26T11:41:00.000Z	Eleaf	fyrestrtr	I used a different port because 21 was blocked.  23 is open
2006-03-26T11:41:00.000Z	Eleaf	fyrestrtr	is scp ftp?  I absolutely need ftp for my program I made
2006-03-26T11:41:00.000Z	Eleaf	fyrestrtr	I need a ftp server, it's not just simple copying.
2006-03-26T11:42:00.000Z	Eleaf	fyrestrtr	it's a complicated distributive project, with a bunch of computers connecting to the ftp server
2006-03-26T11:43:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Eleaf	first thing, open port 21. 23 is used by telnet, so don't use that port.
