2008-04-17T18:26:00.000Z	erUSUL	Flyzoola	can you paste the output of "cat /proc/mounts" on a pastebin ??
2008-04-17T18:08:00.000Z	erUSUL	Flyzoola	if the filesystem is read only not even root can delete the files
2008-04-17T18:10:00.000Z	erUSUL	Flyzoola	you have to remount it rw (sudo mount -o rw,remount /mount/point )
2008-04-17T18:10:00.000Z	Flyzoola	erUSUL	so there's no way to get rid of files on a removable drive that's got a hidden trash bin in it? Surely there must be a way to delete the files, I mean, I was able to do it before with that command (as in send read-only file to hidden trash bin) but now I can't find it. I'm pretty certain that that could fix it
2008-04-17T18:11:00.000Z	erUSUL	Flyzoola	as i said you first have to munt the fs read write
2008-04-17T18:13:00.000Z	Flyzoola	erUSUL	what exactly does that mean. And is the directory you gave me just "X" (meaning I have to replace it with my own [sudo mount -o rw,remount /media/disk/   ?]) or is it the one I need to do it for?
2008-04-17T18:13:00.000Z	erUSUL	Flyzoola	sudo mount -o rw,remount /media/disk/ <<< that's it yes
2008-04-17T18:16:00.000Z	Flyzoola	erUSUL	ok, so I typed in that command, what exactly did it do? and can i type in sudo rm -r /media/disk/.Trash-root now   ?
2008-04-17T18:17:00.000Z	erUSUL	Flyzoola	it remounted (hopefully) the filesystem read write you have to be able to write to delete files (you can not delete on a cdrom; can you?)
2008-04-17T18:17:00.000Z	erUSUL	Flyzoola	if that failed we have to find out why the filesystem is mounted read only
2008-04-17T18:18:00.000Z	Flyzoola	erUSUL	what do you mean remove from cdrom? I am trying to delete from a mass storage device.
2008-04-17T18:19:00.000Z	erUSUL	Flyzoola	it was just an example of a clearly read only filesystem
2008-04-17T18:21:00.000Z	Flyzoola	erUSUL	ok, so now it's telling me it can't find the deirectory?
2008-04-17T18:21:00.000Z	erUSUL	Flyzoola	can you see it (ls /media/disk/* )
2008-04-17T18:22:00.000Z	Flyzoola	erUSUL	yes I can, which is why I find it weird that the terminal can't
2008-04-17T18:23:00.000Z	erUSUL	Flyzoola	check again you havent' made a typo
2008-04-17T18:26:00.000Z	Flyzoola	erUSUL	ok, I think I got it. Now i have another question, i tried transfering a folder to the removable drive and it's telling me that I don't have permission to write to that folder. How do I copy the file over??
2008-04-17T18:29:00.000Z	erUSUL	Flyzoola	yep
