2012-06-11T18:16:00.000Z	AceFace1		and it balances to two similar servers
2012-06-11T18:17:00.000Z	AceFace1		i want the load balancer to be able to fail over to the next IP, and the server to failover to next NIC in the case of any failures
2012-06-11T18:19:00.000Z	AceFace1		thank you plork, i really appreciate your time! :)
2012-06-11T18:19:00.000Z	plork	AceFace1	you are most welcome
2012-06-11T18:19:00.000Z	plork	AceFace1	couldn't you just keep the NIC's with their own IP addresses and then let the load balancer do the rest?
2012-06-11T18:11:00.000Z	plork	AceFace1	yes it is very possible
2012-06-11T18:12:00.000Z	plork	AceFace1	do you want to bond them to give redundancy over switches?
2012-06-11T18:13:00.000Z	AceFace1	plork	redundancy over switches? i dont quite understand
2012-06-11T18:14:00.000Z	plork	AceFace1	what do you want to achieve from your bonding?
2012-06-11T18:15:00.000Z	plork	AceFace1	i.e. do you want to a) get link redundancy (in case of cable / NIC failure), b) get extra throughput, c) get switch redundancy ?
2012-06-11T18:15:00.000Z	plork	AceFace1	to get the multiple IP's is easy though - you just create another section in you network config file that specifies bond0:0 the same way that you specified bond0, with the different IP address
2012-06-11T18:16:00.000Z	AceFace1	plork	after using this method: http://goo.gl/qUQKB , is there a way to assign mutiple IPs? here is my interfaces config: http://pastebin.com/sPTahgcW
2012-06-11T18:16:00.000Z	AceFace1	plork	i want to acheive this: i have a headless server sitting behind a barrauda 640 load balancer
2012-06-11T18:18:00.000Z	plork	AceFace1	you're on the right track. There is a working example here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1423602
2012-06-11T18:19:00.000Z	plork	AceFace1	what's the point of bonding things together, then giving them different IP's if the load balancer is then going to fail over the the different IP's?
2012-06-11T18:21:00.000Z	plork	AceFace1	ok - fair enough
2012-06-11T18:24:00.000Z	plork	AceFace1	yes it does seem like overkill - but if you're working to a spec, it's probably easier and faster to just do it the way you said rather than trying to get a change request approved for the IP's :oP
2012-06-11T18:24:00.000Z	plork	AceFace1	I'm outta here - good luck :o)
