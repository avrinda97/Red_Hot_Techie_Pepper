2008-11-11T01:15:00.000Z	MustafaAhmed	Pici	I have Intel chipset wireless module. When I start ubuntu it works fine..... but when I switch it off then try to switch on again it doesn't respond. it keeps off. I have to restart my computer
2008-11-11T01:16:00.000Z	Pici	MustafaAhmed	Does it show up in network manager after you turn it back on?
2008-11-11T01:18:00.000Z	MustafaAhmed		I don't have network manager.. I have this icon in the taskbar... but it removes the wireless connection choice from it

2008-11-11T01:19:00.000Z	Pici	MustafaAhmed	Are you turning off the wireless from the kill-switch or are you hibernating or suspending the laptop?
2008-11-11T01:19:00.000Z	MustafaAhmed	Pici	no.. I use the fn key
2008-11-11T01:20:00.000Z	Pici	MustafaAhmed	What wireless chipset?
2008-11-11T01:21:00.000Z	MustafaAhmed		Intel pro... I don't know its number... I don't know where can I find the device manager in ubuntu
2008-11-11T01:21:00.000Z	MustafaAhmed	Pici	Intel pro... I don't know its number... I don't know where can I find the device manager in ubuntu
2008-11-11T01:23:00.000Z	Pici	MustafaAhmed	Unforunately, it looks like the bugtracker launchpad.net is down, so I'm unable to look for a bug currently.
2008-11-11T01:24:00.000Z	Pici	MustafaAhmed	you can try to do: sudo invoke-rc.d networking restart   instead of rebooting your computer next time.  Or look on Launchpad in a few minutes.
