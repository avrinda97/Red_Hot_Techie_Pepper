2007-04-14T12:40:00.000Z	niru	fiery_cleric	ok
2007-04-14T12:41:00.000Z	niru	fiery_cleric	I am actually not clear on the firefox issue of debian not using the name and logo
2007-04-14T12:41:00.000Z	niru	fiery_cleric	debian is using iceweasel linking to firefox right
2007-04-14T12:42:00.000Z	fiery_cleric	niru	if u look at http://www.ubuntu.com/products/whatisubuntu/desktop/features ... ubuntu cleary states it uses firefox
2007-04-14T12:43:00.000Z	niru	fiery_cleric	my doubt is since ubuntu is based on debian if something implies for debian then isn't the same applies to ubuntu or any other distro
2007-04-14T12:44:00.000Z	niru	fiery_cleric	and can I use firefox aswell like ubuntu
2007-04-14T12:44:00.000Z	niru	fiery_cleric	to distribut in cd.As I am a derivate of debian
2007-04-14T12:44:00.000Z	fiery_cleric	niru	i think the Mozilla public license mentions something about advertising using firefox name/logo but there is no problem including the software in the distro
2007-04-14T12:46:00.000Z	niru	fiery_cleric	debian is using icewseal but on the application menu internet I can see firefox or icewseal?
2007-04-14T12:47:00.000Z	niru	fiery_cleric	it may be wrong to ask you this are you are from ubuntu.
2007-04-14T12:47:00.000Z	fiery_cleric	niru	dont know ... ask on #debian ...
2007-04-14T12:49:00.000Z	niru	fiery_cleric	so its clear that I can use firefox in my distro to distribute?
2007-04-14T12:50:00.000Z	fiery_cleric	niru	sure can for all intents an purposes i think that the MPL is equivalent to the GPL but i am not a lawyer ... have a look at http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/MPL-1.1.html
