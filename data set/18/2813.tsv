2010-02-18T05:57:00.000Z	damagu		Hey all, what do I do if my / partition is getting full?
2010-02-18T05:58:00.000Z	damagu		Thanks for the sarcasm
2010-02-18T05:58:00.000Z	diss3ntive	damagu	 If your / filesystem is separate from others like /usr /home /var /etc and so on, it may nto be that big of an issue...empty out /tmp and find crap that is taking up space
2010-02-18T05:59:00.000Z	diss3ntive	damagu	 Yea, df -h should tell you which partitions you have other than /
2010-02-18T05:59:00.000Z	damagu	diss3ntive	could it be because I have all these kernels
2010-02-18T05:59:00.000Z	diss3ntive	damagu	 I have no idea how you have your system set up, but /etc/fstab should define your mountpoints
2010-02-18T06:00:00.000Z	damagu	diss3ntive	I have 8GB /  but when I boot up grub is showing about 10 different kernels. Would removing some of them make space on /
2010-02-18T06:02:00.000Z	diss3ntive	damagu	That is located under /boot for the kernel images
2010-02-18T06:02:00.000Z	damagu	diss3ntive	I don't have a separate partition for /boot so it would be in the / partition too right?
2010-02-18T06:03:00.000Z	damagu	diss3ntive	IOW not in my /home partition
2010-02-18T06:03:00.000Z	damagu	diss3ntive	I don't have a separate /boot. I have / and /home
2010-02-18T06:04:00.000Z	diss3ntive	damagu	  cat /etc/fstab  | grep boot | wc -l
2010-02-18T06:05:00.000Z	damagu	diss3ntive	0
2010-02-18T06:05:00.000Z	damagu	diss3ntive	Well I didn't create one
2010-02-18T06:06:00.000Z	damagu	diss3ntive	normally Ubuntu just dumps everything in one partition.... no?
2010-02-18T06:06:00.000Z	damagu	diss3ntive	I created / and /home so that I could keep /home on upgrades
2010-02-18T06:06:00.000Z	diss3ntive	damagu	 I am not sure what Ubuntu does for install
2010-02-18T06:06:00.000Z	damagu	diss3ntive	oh yeah and swap
