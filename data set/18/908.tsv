2011-07-31T05:05:00.000Z	args[0]		can I run rsync on a server to call 2 different servers to sync each others? thanks
2011-07-31T05:07:00.000Z	qin	args[0]	Assuming server have ssh: rsync -avz /source/ -e ssh user@box:/path/ --exclude=something
2011-07-31T05:08:00.000Z	args[0]	qin	but both servers should be able to see each others.. ok
2011-07-31T05:09:00.000Z	qin	args[0]	Make sure to not sync dot files between servers
2011-07-31T05:09:00.000Z	args[0]	qin	ins't that a default?
2011-07-31T05:10:00.000Z	qin	args[0]	Well, running rsync from ~ or / is bad idea.
2011-07-31T05:10:00.000Z	args[0]	qin	i agree
2011-07-31T05:11:00.000Z	args[0]	qin	servers will be syncing raw files only
2011-07-31T05:11:00.000Z	qin	args[0]	raw files?
2011-07-31T05:11:00.000Z	args[0]	qin	image files
2011-07-31T05:12:00.000Z	qin	args[0]	Any file.
2011-07-31T05:13:00.000Z	args[0]	qin	i will be syncing raw image files only, and will not sync from ~ or /
2011-07-31T05:15:00.000Z	qin	args[0]	rsync have some regex, but better to control it by path, so /my/folder/with/images is better than *.jpg (or whatever)
2011-07-31T05:16:00.000Z	args[0]	qin	sure, another question.. can rsync send/write to file a log and state whether sync was successful or not? (with some statistical data)
2011-07-31T05:21:00.000Z	qin	args[0]	Sure: Just > your rsync command to data file, like: rsync [all stuff here...] >  `date +%Y%m%d` , and you have your "log" file.
2011-07-31T05:21:00.000Z	args[0]	qin	awesome,thanks
2011-07-31T05:24:00.000Z	qin	args[0]	Whatever you do, read man rsync, it is very smart tool, and easy to use for complex tasks.
2011-07-31T05:25:00.000Z	args[0]	qin	thanks, i've already used it for syncs over local network, this time i want to set a cron on a remote server to call 2 VPSs and sync b/w them, i will read man pages.
