2006-01-22T06:13:00.000Z	hav0k		http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/7227
2006-01-22T06:13:00.000Z	hav0k		sorry, i havent really used pastebin much
2006-01-22T06:14:00.000Z	hav0k		can i not do that?
2006-01-22T06:15:00.000Z	mwe	hav0k	I think gparted can do it. not while it's mounted though
2006-01-22T06:15:00.000Z	hav0k		cause it's huge, and i want to put all my music on my ntfs part so i can listen to it in both windows and linux
2006-01-22T06:15:00.000Z	hav0k		but if i unmount it, wouldnt that mean i couldnt use linux anymore?  i mean, i think that's right
2006-01-22T06:15:00.000Z	mwe	hav0k	you need a live cd
2006-01-22T06:15:00.000Z	hav0k		well lucky me, i already have one
2006-01-22T06:16:00.000Z	mwe	hav0k	you can't unmount the root file system
2006-01-22T06:16:00.000Z	hav0k		yeah, that's what i thought
2006-01-22T06:16:00.000Z	hav0k		alright, so i just need to boot up the live cd, but will gparted be on it?  wait, i think my knopix cd has qtparted on it.
2006-01-22T06:17:00.000Z	mwe	hav0k	yeah. it always makes the window way way to big to fit the desktop for me though
2006-01-22T06:17:00.000Z	hav0k	navarone	that sounds rather complicated... but if i were to do that, i would just take the 15 or so gb and make that fat32
2006-01-22T06:17:00.000Z	mwe	hav0k	but I think you can manage
