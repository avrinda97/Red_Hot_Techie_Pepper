2010-09-17T02:11:00.000Z	uLinux		hello!
2010-09-17T02:11:00.000Z	uLinux		I'm gonna delete Windows XP partitio then how can I use that space on Ubuntu?
2010-09-17T02:11:00.000Z	uLinux		partition
2010-09-17T02:12:00.000Z	wieshka	uLinux	 so you want to delete windows partition and use it in ubuntu ?
2010-09-17T02:18:00.000Z	wieshka	uLinux	 how big is your ubuntu and windows aprtitions ?
2010-09-17T02:18:00.000Z	uLinux	wieshka	windows partition is like 30 gb.. small and ubuntu is huge
2010-09-17T02:22:00.000Z	wieshka	uLinux	its becouse booting from live cd, your HDD stays unmounted, so you can use live cd gparted fully
2010-09-17T02:25:00.000Z	uLinux	wieshka	Emanon usually I use XP cd to delete XP partition I never did it using gparted where can I find a guide
2010-09-17T02:26:00.000Z	wieshka	uLinux	you will have to just delete partition, where win xp is installed
2010-09-17T02:26:00.000Z	uLinux	wieshka	and then grub is fixed automatically too?
2010-09-17T02:26:00.000Z	wieshka	uLinux	 and you can save time - do it from gparted, not booting win xp disk also
2010-09-17T02:29:00.000Z	uLinux	wieshka	gparted will fill the space or just reformat the old xp partition?
2010-09-17T02:31:00.000Z	wieshka	uLinux	 with gparted you can delete xp partition to make it unallocated and then you can try at your own risk to expand your existing ubuntu partition with unallocated space
2010-09-17T02:31:00.000Z	uLinux	wieshka	at my own risk? shouldn't gparted be safe
2010-09-17T03:48:00.000Z	wieshka	uLinux	you can even use http://webchat.freenode.net
2010-09-17T03:52:00.000Z	wieshka	uLinux	 i have already explained you - it is pretty simple - you have to run live cd, to prevent mounting of HDD, after that run gparted, and delete windows partition, so you will get extra 30 Gb unallocated space ... after that you can resize partition of ubuntu at your own risk to get extra 30 Gb
2010-09-17T03:53:00.000Z	uLinux	wieshka	yes but theres is a 2mb of unallocated space
2010-09-17T03:53:00.000Z	wieshka	uLinux	 after deleting 30 Gb partition you will have 30.002 Gb unallocated space :)
