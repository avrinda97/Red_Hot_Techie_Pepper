2008-07-30T08:24:00.000Z	boho103		hey I need
2008-07-30T08:24:00.000Z	boho103		some help :[
2008-07-30T08:24:00.000Z	Mr_Bunny_	boho103	what's your problem?
2008-07-30T08:26:00.000Z	Mr_Bunny_	boho103	weird - what graphics card are you running, and have you tried ctrl-alt-backspace instead of a hard reboot?
2008-07-30T08:27:00.000Z	Mr_Bunny_	boho103	disabling effects is a good starting point
2008-07-30T08:29:00.000Z	Mr_Bunny_	boho103	the ctrl-alt-backspace key combo restarts the x server
2008-07-30T08:29:00.000Z	Mr_Bunny_	boho103	meaning it reloads the graphical interface
2008-07-30T08:30:00.000Z	Mr_Bunny_	boho103	not if your display isn't glitching, no
2008-07-30T08:30:00.000Z	Mr_Bunny_	boho103	have you enabled restricted drivers for your card?
2008-07-30T08:31:00.000Z	Mr_Bunny_	boho103	well, now we know what to do - roll back your drivers
2008-07-30T08:32:00.000Z	Mr_Bunny_	boho103	I don't know, I'll have to do some googling
2008-07-30T08:35:00.000Z	Mr_Bunny_	boho103	alright, it looks like there's a newer 8.7 version out, released 8 days ago. since it looks like ubuntu hasn't rolled out the update, you are faced with two immediate options: you can wait for ubuntu to update the drivers, which will have less of a chance of causing problems upon kernel upgrade, or you can install the drivers yourself now, the downside being a kernel upgrade may break them
2008-07-30T08:47:00.000Z	Mr_Bunny_	boho103	yes, then run it with ./[driver file name]
2008-07-30T08:42:00.000Z	Mr_Bunny_	boho103	your starting point will be here - http://ati.amd.com/support/driver.html
2008-07-30T08:47:00.000Z	Mr_Bunny_	boho103	go to applications>accessories, and open terminal
2008-07-30T08:47:00.000Z	Mr_Bunny_	boho103	what directory did you save the drivers in?
2008-07-30T08:50:00.000Z	Mr_Bunny_	boho103	*cough* https://a248.e.akamai.net/f/674/9206/0/www2.ati.com/drivers/linux/linux_cat87-inst.html
2008-07-30T08:57:00.000Z	Mr_Bunny_	boho103	ah, it was a shell script
