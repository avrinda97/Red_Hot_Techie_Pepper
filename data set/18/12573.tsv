2006-07-08T06:15:00.000Z	W8TAH		hi folks i am trying to upgrade Konversation on my breezy system -- i have the deb file -- how do I make synaptic use that to upgrade it?
2006-07-08T06:16:00.000Z	eobanb	W8TAH	all you have to do is sudo apt-get install konversation.  you don't need to download a .deb file yourself
2006-07-08T06:17:00.000Z	W8TAH	eobanb	.19 does not appear to be in synaptic -- it says the latest avail is .18
2006-07-08T06:17:00.000Z	eobanb	W8TAH	do you really need 0.19?
2006-07-08T06:18:00.000Z	W8TAH	eobanb	yes, it has a few bugfixes in it that i want unless i will endanger my system by installing it
2006-07-08T06:18:00.000Z	eobanb	W8TAH	i see 0.19
2006-07-08T06:18:00.000Z	eobanb	W8TAH	are you running 6.06?
2006-07-08T06:19:00.000Z	eobanb	W8TAH	well there you go..
2006-07-08T06:19:00.000Z	eobanb	W8TAH	time to dist-upgrade..
2006-07-08T06:19:00.000Z	W8TAH	eobanb	ok
2006-07-08T06:30:00.000Z	eobanb	W8TAH	don't try compiling conversation yourself, the dependencies are outrageous
2006-07-08T06:31:00.000Z	W8TAH	eobanb	ok - thanks a bunch - -i appreciate the warning - - back to .18
2006-07-08T06:31:00.000Z	eobanb	W8TAH	dpkg -i the 0.19 .deb file or upgrade to dapper
2006-07-08T06:31:00.000Z	W8TAH	eobanb	dpkg -i hits dep errors also
2006-07-08T06:31:00.000Z	eobanb	W8TAH	then upgrade to dapper
2006-07-08T06:31:00.000Z	W8TAH	eobanb	i'll wait till i switch the system to gentoo and do it from there
2006-08-24T14:15:00.000Z	eobanb	W8TAH	that would be build-essential
2006-08-24T14:15:00.000Z	W8TAH	eobanb	thank you very much
