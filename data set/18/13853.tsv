2006-03-31T15:57:00.000Z	tamale		only she can grant permission for mounting
2006-03-31T15:59:00.000Z	tamale		I just had an awesome idea....  there should be a repository for xorg.conf files for ALL SORTS of different configurations, so newbies like me don't have to know how to code!!!  OR.. better yet, a tool that AUTOMATICALLY genererates an xorg.conf file for you after you give the setup you want
2006-03-31T16:00:00.000Z	tamale		for me, the install took way longer, but that's only 'cause i didn't know wtf i was doing
2006-03-31T16:01:00.000Z	tamale		i haven't found any "config tools" for dual monitors  :p

2006-03-31T16:03:00.000Z	mwe	tamale	well booting xp in 23 seconds is really fast I think
