2008-02-01T09:04:00.000Z	gmcastil	techgeek40	is it an older one?
2008-02-01T09:05:00.000Z	techgeek40	gmcastil	it's the 54 Mbps Wireless PC Card (PCMCIA) WG511 v2
2008-02-01T09:05:00.000Z	gmcastil	techgeek40	that's probably the only way to make it work...and it still might not
2008-02-01T09:05:00.000Z	gmcastil	techgeek40	some of the older wireless pcmcia cards just plain sucked in linux
2008-02-01T09:06:00.000Z	techgeek40	gmcastil	I'm noticing - but I even read the FAQ on netgear's site - got the lastest drivers for Windows 2000/XP and followed all the helpme / readme's I could
2008-02-01T09:07:00.000Z	techgeek40	gmcastil	I will say this for XP/Vista - installation of drivers is not as indepth as it is in linux
2008-02-01T09:08:00.000Z	gmcastil	techgeek40	no one argues that linux requires the same amount of brain matter as windows
2008-02-01T09:09:00.000Z	techgeek40	gmcastil	the company I work for is asking me to get my linux running good (on my laptop that I take to work) so they can install their software with wine and sell it - but sadly - the application isn't working too well
2008-02-01T09:10:00.000Z	gmcastil	techgeek40	and you've never used linux before?
2008-02-01T09:10:00.000Z	techgeek40	gmcastil	I did about ten years ago - briefly - but mainly for 26 years been dos/windows guy
2008-02-01T09:10:00.000Z	gmcastil	techgeek40	yikes
2008-02-01T09:11:00.000Z	gmcastil	techgeek40	i'd probably take the time that they're giving you to learn linux
2008-02-01T09:11:00.000Z	techgeek40	gmcastil	it's not been bad - I've actually enjoyed it in a lot of ways
2008-02-01T09:11:00.000Z	gmcastil	techgeek40	yeah....take every opportunity to learn new skills
2008-02-01T09:11:00.000Z	techgeek40	gmcastil	I am - trust me I am
2008-02-01T09:47:00.000Z	gmcastil	techgeek40	there are more things than i can count wrong with that
2008-02-01T09:47:00.000Z	techgeek40	gmcastil	me too
2008-02-01T10:14:00.000Z	gmcastil	techgeek40	later
