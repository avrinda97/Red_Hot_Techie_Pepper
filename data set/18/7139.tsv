2008-08-26T07:22:00.000Z	misteralexander		I'm trying to 'mount' an internal hard drive in ' / ' and having a hell of time.  I've tried WIKI's and the Ubuntu Help site. How do you do this? I'm using UBUNTU LINUX - Hardy
2008-08-26T07:23:00.000Z	misteralexander		[_Zeus_] Wherever it needs to be mounted so it shows up next to 'My Book' & 'File System' when I go to Computer.

2008-08-26T07:27:00.000Z	misteralexander		[_Zeus_] ==> Anytime I mention the word "Computer" everyone imediately thinks I'm using Windows.  I'm just trying to mount this damn volume so it shows up next to "File System". How do I do this??? I've tried my own research, to no avail. Please Help.
2008-08-26T07:28:00.000Z	Pici	misteralexander	What are you trying to mount and where do you want to mount it to?
2008-08-26T07:29:00.000Z	Pici	misteralexander	okay, And where are you trying to mount it to?
2008-08-26T07:33:00.000Z	Pici	misteralexander	Are you on a LiveCD right now or are you on your normal install? I'm just trying to get an idea of where you want to mount this. If you're running your normal install, you've already got something mounted to / , so you'd need to mount it somewhere else.
2008-08-26T07:34:00.000Z	misteralexander	Pici	Normal Install.  Just wherever it "needs" to go, to be a permanent hard drive.  Eventually, I'm going to try and move the '/home' & '/usr/bin' directories there . . . if that helps any.
2008-08-26T07:35:00.000Z	Pici	misteralexander	Well, you can create a directory in /media/  name it anything you want and mount the partition there.
2008-08-26T07:38:00.000Z	misteralexander	Pici	can I move '/home' & 'usr/bin' onto that partition if I do that?  This is a second hard drive, the filesystem is installed on 'sda' and i'm dealing with 'sdb'
2008-08-26T07:38:00.000Z	Pici	misteralexander	You can move /home there, but not /usr/bin/ as well.
2008-08-26T07:39:00.000Z	misteralexander	Pici	let me guess, that's got to be on another partition, if I want to move it, right?
2008-08-26T07:41:00.000Z	Pici	misteralexander	I don't know of any way to mount a partition to two mountpoints, so yes.
2008-08-26T07:42:00.000Z	misteralexander	Pici	Okay, so I'm going to do this:  sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /media/slave ext3      . . . . right?
2008-08-26T07:42:00.000Z	Pici	misteralexander	sudo mount -t ext3 /dev/sdb1 /media/slave
2008-08-26T07:50:00.000Z	misteralexander	Pici	It worked, THANKS!
2008-08-26T07:50:00.000Z	Pici	misteralexander	sure thing
