2010-05-01T18:58:00.000Z	DarkTatka		Hi, im having problem with Lynx boot time, which takes about 5min. I have bootchart generated, although I cant read it much.
2010-05-01T19:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip_	DarkTatka	use: dmesg | less       look at the timestamps on the left, if yuo see a big gap then thats your issue
2010-05-01T19:00:00.000Z	DarkTatka	ActionParsnip_	Are you sure you respond to me?
2010-05-01T19:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip_	DarkTatka	yes, thats why I addressed you
2010-05-01T19:04:00.000Z	DarkTatka	ActionParsnip_	http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/SQ7LKPPx . Problem located. What does it mean?

2010-05-01T19:09:00.000Z	DarkTatka	ActionParsnip_	If i read the bug comments correctly, nobody knows exactly whats going on. According to bootchart I generated with om26er it takes 300sec for fsck.vfat to fiinish. Is it relevant?
2010-05-01T19:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip_	DarkTatka	do you use vfat?
2010-05-01T19:11:00.000Z	DarkTatka	ActionParsnip_	I have 100GB FAT32 partition on /dev/sda4 with legacy data, ubuntu is on ext4 /dev/sda3 16GB . Previously I thought it was caused by fsck checking /dev/sda4 every single time at boot time
2010-05-01T19:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip_	DarkTatka	yowser bet thats a LOT flakey at best
2010-05-01T19:12:00.000Z	DarkTatka	ActionParsnip_	yowser and flakey? not following you mate
2010-05-01T19:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip_	DarkTatka	yowser is an exclamation of shock, fat32 really isnt robust and random power offs can garbage data
2010-05-01T19:17:00.000Z	DarkTatka	ActionParsnip_	Lets say its from days of yore. Anyway, I can switch it to ntfs if I really really need to, just not happy about it. Do you think it will help?
2010-05-01T19:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip_	DarkTatka	could try it to test
2010-05-01T19:18:00.000Z	DarkTatka	ActionParsnip_	Hm, spending 20 minutes installing ubuntu and hours making it at least work feels so... Old school.
2010-05-01T19:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip_	DarkTatka	lucid is still very young so will have issues. canonical have a rigid release schedule as opposed to debians more flexible approach
2010-05-01T19:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip_	DarkTatka	so you will get a few issues for a while after release
2010-05-01T19:20:00.000Z	DarkTatka	ActionParsnip_	Well, I will switch to NTFS and we will see..
