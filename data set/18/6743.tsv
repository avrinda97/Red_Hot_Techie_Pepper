2008-05-13T00:55:00.000Z	ChaosTheory_	kitche	Now I want a similar numbered-links format for a flash browser.
2008-05-13T00:55:00.000Z	ChaosTheory_	kitche	I'm thinking about Konqueror.
2008-05-13T00:56:00.000Z	ChaosTheory_	kitche	Right.
2008-06-23T04:58:00.000Z	kitche	ChaosTheory_	you don't they automatically show up
2008-06-23T04:59:00.000Z	ChaosTheory_	kitche	I just sent something to myself and I don't think I received it. . .
2008-06-23T05:00:00.000Z	kitche	ChaosTheory_	if you just sent it you have to wait for fetchmail or getmail to retrive the mail :)
2008-06-23T05:00:00.000Z	ChaosTheory_	kitche	How long does that usually take?
2008-06-23T05:02:00.000Z	kitche	ChaosTheory_	depends how you have it set up
2008-06-23T05:02:00.000Z	ChaosTheory_	kitche	How can I edit those settings?
2008-06-23T05:03:00.000Z	ChaosTheory_	kitche	I use IMAP for gmail, thogh.
2008-06-23T05:04:00.000Z	kitche	ChaosTheory_	so? what are you using to fetch your mail?
2008-06-23T05:05:00.000Z	ChaosTheory_	kitche	fetchmail
2008-06-23T05:05:00.000Z	ChaosTheory_	kitche	procmail, fetchmail, all that stuff that you find from Googling :D
2008-06-23T05:06:00.000Z	ChaosTheory_	kitche	it works I just have to exit + restart to get the new messages
2008-06-23T05:07:00.000Z	ChaosTheory_	kitche	I think I can do set mail_check
2008-06-23T05:14:00.000Z	ChaosTheory_	kitche	Yep, it works. =]
