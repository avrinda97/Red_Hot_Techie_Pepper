2005-09-26T10:13:00.000Z	stormie		is that the right command for mounting an ntfs partition for reading on ubuntu?
2005-09-26T10:13:00.000Z	nalioth	stormie	there's a nice script you can use /msg ubotu ntfs
2005-09-26T10:16:00.000Z	nalioth	stormie	writing to NTFS will lead to an all linux box
2005-09-26T10:16:00.000Z	stormie	nalioth	sry, how do i use that utility , im new to linux =\
2005-09-26T10:17:00.000Z	nalioth	stormie	you download it and read it in a text editor
2005-09-26T10:17:00.000Z	nalioth	stormie	if you have further questions after that, please ask
2005-09-26T10:18:00.000Z	nalioth	stormie	brenner: most shell scripts have instructions in them (they can be opened with a text editor)
2005-09-26T10:21:00.000Z	stormie	nalioth	ok i ran the script, where do i see the ntfs partition now?
2005-09-26T10:21:00.000Z	nalioth	stormie	look in /media i believe
2005-09-26T10:23:00.000Z	stormie	nalioth	it made a bunch of directories in it (65gb disk hda1, floppy0, cdrom0) but they are all empty
2005-09-26T10:23:00.000Z	nalioth	stormie	really?
2005-09-26T10:24:00.000Z	stormie	nalioth	yes, when i ran the shell script it gave me the same msg it gives me when i tried using the mount command, where can i paste it?
