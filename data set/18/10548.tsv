2007-01-15T08:45:00.000Z	higi_		hello. since trevinho's repository screwed up my "wpasupplicant" package, i cannot install nor do anything with apt-get. Can anyone help me fixing this problem please?
2007-01-15T08:46:00.000Z	stefg	higi_	first reset your sources.list to a sane condition, then 'sudo apt-get update' for a start
2007-01-15T08:48:00.000Z	higi_		stetf they are in a sane condition already
2007-01-15T08:48:00.000Z	higi_		stefg
2007-01-15T08:48:00.000Z	stefg	higi_	ok, can you run 'sudo apt-get -f install' succesfully?
2007-01-15T08:49:00.000Z	higi_	stefg	no
2007-01-15T08:49:00.000Z	higi_		i cant
2007-01-15T08:49:00.000Z	stefg		what happens? (pastes to pastebin please!)
2007-01-15T08:49:00.000Z	higi_		it tellsme "E: tha package wpasupplicant needs to be resinstalled, but cannot finda file for it.
2007-01-15T08:49:00.000Z	higi_		oh sorry i copied it here
2007-01-15T08:50:00.000Z	stefg	higi_	sudo apt-get remove --purge wpasupplicant
2007-01-15T08:50:00.000Z	higi_		it still tells me the same.. it needs to be reinstalled but cannot find..
2007-01-15T08:51:00.000Z	higi_		i tried to download a .deb package containing the package, and it does not let me install it

2007-01-15T08:53:00.000Z	stefg	higi_	does 'sudo dpkg --configure -a ' get you further?
2007-01-15T08:54:00.000Z	higi_	stefg	no, it doesnt, :S
2007-01-15T08:55:00.000Z	stefg	higi_	then you 've got to read about dpkg's --force options
