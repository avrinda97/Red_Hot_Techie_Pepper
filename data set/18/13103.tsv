2006-01-10T08:17:00.000Z	seicherlbob	gnomefreak	good morning!
2006-01-11T12:38:00.000Z	seicherlbob	gnomefreak	you know what magic files are?
2006-01-12T07:50:00.000Z	gnomefreak	seicherlbob	your running ubuntu my guess is that you have atleast 128mb ram
2006-01-12T07:50:00.000Z	seicherlbob	gnomefreak	morning my friend.On my fileserver, i got debian.
2006-01-12T07:51:00.000Z	seicherlbob	gnomefreak	still not finished with the recover stuff.... need a magic file (/etc/magic) but mine is empty
2006-01-12T08:19:00.000Z	seicherlbob	gnomefreak	WOHOOO! Filerecovery is running! lets see ...
2006-03-06T09:51:00.000Z	gnomefreak	seicherlbob	yes that is why its locked by default
2006-03-06T09:51:00.000Z	gnomefreak	seicherlbob	im sure you would have to add yourself back to the sudoers list
2006-03-06T09:51:00.000Z	seicherlbob	gnomefreak	?? what you mean by "locked". I can sudo. but there is no password
2006-03-06T09:52:00.000Z	gnomefreak	seicherlbob	that site should help for the most part
2006-03-06T09:52:00.000Z	seicherlbob	gnomefreak	i know. but its no problem with the root. I'd like to set the sudo-password
2006-03-06T09:55:00.000Z	gnomefreak	seicherlbob	that site should tell you how to reset it
2006-03-06T10:04:00.000Z	seicherlbob	gnomefreak	sorry, i only found instructions on allowing sudo and setting sudo to ask for root-password. but i want to ask it for the userpassword. do i have to disable the rootpassword to enable sudo? Might it be a problem that the passwords are equal?
2006-03-06T10:05:00.000Z	gnomefreak	seicherlbob	it could be a problem but i dont know i have never enabled su
2006-03-06T10:06:00.000Z	seicherlbob	gnomefreak	well, enabling su means setting a clear password. thats the only difference, or am i wrong?
2006-03-06T10:07:00.000Z	gnomefreak	seicherlbob	ive seen alot of people mess up their sudo by enabling su but i dont use su ever for a good reason to :)
2006-03-06T10:09:00.000Z	seicherlbob	gnomefreak	when i'm member of group admin... will this cause sudo to become useless?
