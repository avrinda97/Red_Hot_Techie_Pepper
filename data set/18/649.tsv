2011-12-07T23:28:00.000Z	i2c		hey guys I think I have a problem. I have ubuntu on my desktop and laptop, and my laptop says there are updates available, but on my desktop it says all my software is updated. I think something is wrong with the sources my desktop is trying to get updates from.
2011-12-07T23:29:00.000Z	sskalnik	i2c	paste the result of "cat /etc/apt/sources.list" from each machine
2011-12-07T23:30:00.000Z	i2c	sskalnik	http://pastebin.com/Cqy9iiE8
2011-12-07T23:31:00.000Z	sskalnik	i2c	Paste the second one as well?
2011-12-07T23:32:00.000Z	i2c	sskalnik	what do you mean second one?
2011-12-07T23:33:00.000Z	sskalnik	i2c	The issue is that your laptop and desktop disagree about whether there are updates, correct? If so, paste the contents of the sources.list from each one.
2011-12-07T23:33:00.000Z	sskalnik	i2c	No prob!
2011-12-07T23:34:00.000Z	sskalnik	i2c	There might be a slight difference between the sources.list; compare side by side and see if one has extra repos
2011-12-07T23:35:00.000Z	i2c	sskalnik	here is the second one, I'm going to comb through it as well http://pastebin.com/jTjm3qhh
2011-12-07T23:35:00.000Z	sskalnik	i2c	Aha! First one is Natty, second is Ocelot
2011-12-07T23:36:00.000Z	sskalnik	i2c	One machine is running 11.04, the other 11.10. Ergo, different updates.
2011-12-07T23:38:00.000Z	sskalnik	i2c	run "cat /etc/lsb-release" on both machines
2011-12-07T23:40:00.000Z	sskalnik	i2c	Check the bottom of the one that was upgraded; looks like it has additional sources
2011-12-07T23:41:00.000Z	sskalnik	i2c	The laptop says there are updates but the desktop does not?
2011-12-07T23:44:00.000Z	i2c	sskalnik	yes, the desktop has not had updates since I did the 11.10 upgrade a couple of days ago. I tried doing update manager yesterday, but it complained saying it couldn't download all of the sources or something, because one of them was like cdrom//:something so that is what started this mystery. I opened software sources and unchecked the cdrom and then tried software update again and it found no new updates. I mean I guess it's possible I ha
2011-12-07T23:45:00.000Z	sskalnik	i2c	I would copy all the sources from the 11.10 machine to the upgraded 11.04>11.10 machine
2011-12-07T23:50:00.000Z	i2c	sskalnik	I think I'm just going to reinstall 11.10 onto my desktop, a fresh start would do me well I guess. thanks for your help
2011-12-07T23:51:00.000Z	sskalnik	i2c	alrighty. I do recommend fresh installs when it's feasible, so that is probably a good idea.
