2009-11-13T00:00:00.000Z	Younder		InfoFG: probably yes
2009-11-13T00:01:00.000Z	Younder		infoFG: in yoyr case I recomend a full reinstall. So start by reformatting your drive
2009-11-13T00:01:00.000Z	LjL	Younder	why?
2009-11-13T00:02:00.000Z	LjL	Younder	he's saying he *doesn't currently have it installed* in the first place. what would he reinstall?
2009-11-13T00:04:00.000Z	Younder	LjL	he askes for an update
2009-11-13T00:06:00.000Z	LjL	Younder	what kind of answer is that? why did you suggest "shutdown -h now" earlier, also?
2009-11-13T00:07:00.000Z	Younder	LjL	that was for a quick shutdown from a script
2009-11-13T00:08:00.000Z	Younder	LjL	and as such it is damn effecive
2009-11-13T00:09:00.000Z	LjL	Younder	i see
2009-11-23T17:43:00.000Z	LjL	Younder	how?
2012-02-17T18:07:00.000Z	LjL	Younder	superseding the installed version of GCC is in all likelihood a Bad Idea(tm). if anything, they should install the new version either in a place not in $PATH or with a different name, to only call it when needed.
2012-02-17T18:08:00.000Z	Younder	LjL	yes, but intsalling it will default tu /usr/local/bin leaving the default installation alone
2012-02-17T18:09:00.000Z	Younder	LjL	If you get in trouble just remove the link in /usr/local/bin
2012-02-17T18:09:00.000Z	LjL	Younder	it will, but it means whenever anything tries to call "gcc", the one in /usr/local will run, and that's not very good. Ubuntu packages of various versions of GCC installs binaries like "gcc-x.x" instead
2012-02-17T18:11:00.000Z	Younder	LjL	true, and indeed just deleteing /usr/local/bin/gcc will leave the gcc with the newest version there so that is probalby what you whould do
2012-02-17T18:12:00.000Z	Younder	LjL	The link not the program..
2012-02-17T18:14:00.000Z	Younder	LjL	run a which gcc. If only /usr/bin/gcc occurs your fine
2012-02-17T18:25:00.000Z	LjL	Younder	ikonia: well, a part of it *is* about agreeing where to install things. but there's more pressing parts, like agreeing on package names (for dependencies), and not stomping on each other's feet
