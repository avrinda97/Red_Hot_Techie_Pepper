2011-04-03T02:41:00.000Z	jon__		If I already have ubuntu and windows loaded I should take ubuntu off and put it back on?
2011-04-03T02:42:00.000Z	jon__		hmm?
2011-04-03T02:44:00.000Z	jon__		Is there anyway I can back up all of my ubuntu settings and then reinstall it later and get it all back?
2011-04-03T02:45:00.000Z	jon__		And I can just drag them all to a hard drive?
2011-04-03T02:46:00.000Z	jon__		by restore do you mean I just replace the new one with the old one?
2011-04-03T02:47:00.000Z	jon__		Ok thanks
2011-04-03T02:48:00.000Z	jon__		Where can I find that?
2011-04-03T02:50:00.000Z	jon__		it giving me the error "The folder ".gnupg" cannot be handled because you do not have permissions to read it."
2011-04-03T02:51:00.000Z	Axlin	jon__	just skip it. you don't need it
2011-04-03T02:35:00.000Z	Axlin	jon__	on a mac?
2011-04-03T02:36:00.000Z	Axlin	jon__	well you should probably start with a hackintosh guide. i know lifehacker has a couple of good ones to set up a dual boot windows/os x system. after that, you'd just create another partition for linux and install ubuntu there
2011-04-03T02:38:00.000Z	Axlin	jon__	yes. you should be presented with a graphical boot loader which will list windows, os x, linux, and any other bootable media
2011-04-03T02:38:00.000Z	Axlin	jon__	the lifehacker guides should go into detail about that
2011-04-03T02:45:00.000Z	Axlin	jon__	back up your entire home folder. make sure to include hidden files (ctrl+h to show them)
2011-04-03T02:46:00.000Z	Axlin	jon__	yep, and restore them after reinstallation. make sure your new install uses the same username
2011-04-03T02:46:00.000Z	Axlin	jon__	exactly. so after you finish installing, you go to your backup, and replace your new /home folder with the backed up /home folder
2011-04-03T02:47:00.000Z	Axlin	jon__	you may also want to back up /etc/apt as well if you have added any custom repositories. otherwise, you'll have to re-add them
2011-04-03T02:54:00.000Z	Axlin	jon__	if i were you, i would look up one of those how-to's on lifehacker to see if you're willing to go through with it to begin with
