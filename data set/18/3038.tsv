2010-04-09T13:56:00.000Z	pagore	chelz	Hi chelz, your reply showed how i can add emblemes, but i want the file(s) where the information of which file has an embleme and which has not is saved. :)
2010-04-09T13:57:00.000Z	pagore	chelz	ich = if (sry)
2010-04-09T13:57:00.000Z	chelz	pagore	that would be something that's part of gnome. i don't think that can be easily transferred.
2010-04-09T13:58:00.000Z	chelz	pagore	/apps/nautilus/desktop-metadata seems to be where's it's store in gconf
2010-04-09T13:58:00.000Z	chelz	pagore	you'll have to look into syncing gconf stuff
2010-04-09T13:58:00.000Z	pagore	chelz	sec :)
2010-04-09T14:01:00.000Z	chelz	pagore	i guess check out ~/.gconf
2010-04-09T14:12:00.000Z	pagore	chelz	ok u are in the right, the information about emblemes is realy saved in ~/.gconf , now i just need to find out where exactly :)
