2010-08-12T08:28:00.000Z	coz_	mlmg317-himts	not sure  it may be   clamscan -r
2010-08-12T08:28:00.000Z	coz_	mlmg317-himts	  I know that clamscan -r /home will scan home directory recursively
2010-08-12T08:32:00.000Z	mlmg317-himts	coz_	yeah, I remember "clamscan -r".  So then what would I enter to in addition to "clamscan -r" if I wanted to scan the entire file system?
2010-08-12T08:33:00.000Z	coz_	mlmg317-himts	  mm maybe  sudo clamscan -r
2010-08-12T08:34:00.000Z	coz_	mlmg317-himts	 I believe there are both gtk and qt frontends for clamav as well
2010-08-12T08:34:00.000Z	coz_	mlmg317-himts	 you could also try   man clamscan
2010-08-12T08:35:00.000Z	mlmg317-himts	coz_	Yeah - I have had troubles with GUI.  It will stall in the middle of full system scan - and never finish ...  I tried "man clamscan" - but didn't see a command listed for full sytem scan ...
2010-08-12T08:36:00.000Z	mlmg317-himts	coz_	what is the difference between "gtk" and "qt" frontends for clamscan?
2010-08-12T08:36:00.000Z	coz_	mlmg317-himts	   simply   gtk is for gnome and qt for kde
2010-08-12T08:37:00.000Z	mlmg317-himts	coz_	Hmmm.  What would "clamscan -l" do?
2010-08-12T08:37:00.000Z	coz_	mlmg317-himts	 good question  give it a try :)

2010-08-12T08:38:00.000Z	coz_	mlmg317-himts	 oh!  try  sudo clamscan -r /
2010-08-12T08:39:00.000Z	coz_	mlmg317-himts	 or  to show only infected files  try   sudo clamscan -r --bell -i /
2010-08-12T08:41:00.000Z	coz_	mlmg317-himts	 that second command I gave you seems to be the one you want
2010-08-12T08:41:00.000Z	coz_	mlmg317-himts	   sudo clamscan -r --bell -i /
2010-08-12T08:42:00.000Z	mlmg317-himts	coz_	Yes - you have provided me all the information I was looking for.  Thank you !!!
