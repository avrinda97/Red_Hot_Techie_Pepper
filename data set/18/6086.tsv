2008-07-04T19:59:00.000Z	ne2k__		any recommendations for a decent-looking programmer's editor for gnome with syntax-highlighting, code completion, etc. for perl?
2008-07-04T20:01:00.000Z	ne2k__		I installed xemacs21-gnome-nomule and it looks horrible. I then installed emacs22-nomule and it also looks horrible. is there nothing that looks GNOME-ish?
2008-07-04T20:03:00.000Z	ne2k__		I installed Ubuntu under Wubi from Windows XP. is it possible to boot my windows partition inside a virtual machine from within Ubuntu using a virtual machine? should I use virtualbox or qemu?
2008-07-04T20:04:00.000Z	kirrus	ne2k__	no, not really
2008-07-04T20:05:00.000Z	kirrus	ne2k__	the problem is the filesystem access would become really complicated... You can do it if you have a standard install of Ubuntu, in its own partition
2008-07-04T20:06:00.000Z	ne2k__	kirrus	why can't I just point it at the partition all the same? windows isn't going to do anything to my loopback file
2008-07-04T20:07:00.000Z	ne2k__	kirrus	obviously, if it did, it would cause mayhem
2008-07-04T20:07:00.000Z	kirrus	ne2k__	you're running Linux off your active windows partition - you can't then use Linux to mount the windows partiton in a VM, because Linux is using it
2008-07-04T20:08:00.000Z	ne2k__	kirrus	but the VM doesn't "mount" the partition, it does raw access to the device, no?
2008-07-04T20:08:00.000Z	kirrus	ne2k__	it mounts it
2008-07-04T20:08:00.000Z	ne2k__	kirrus	there wouldn't be any point in the VM "mounting" it, because it wouldn't be able to do anything raw to the disk
2008-07-04T20:09:00.000Z	ne2k__	kirrus	for example, the virtual bios wouldn't know how to read the mbr
2008-07-04T20:09:00.000Z	kirrus	ne2k__	it won't work ;)
2008-07-04T20:10:00.000Z	kirrus	ne2k__	its not a case of mbrs and bios, its a case of locking the partition
2008-07-04T20:11:00.000Z	ne2k__	kirrus	I'm convinced that vmware used to be able to do it when I used it years ago.
2008-07-04T20:12:00.000Z	ne2k__	kirrus	virtualbox won't let me add /dev/hda1 as a partition to boot from. it seems to want a .vdi or .vmdk file only
2008-07-04T20:12:00.000Z	kirrus	ne2k__	you can't do it in virtualbox, from memory, only VMware
2008-07-04T20:13:00.000Z	ne2k__	kirrus	that suX0rz ;-)
