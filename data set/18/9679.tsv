2008-01-13T12:47:00.000Z	arooni_		can someone help me get my flash drive working?
2008-01-13T12:48:00.000Z	msl	arooni_	have you plugged it in
2008-01-13T12:48:00.000Z	arooni_	msl	yes
2008-01-13T12:48:00.000Z	arooni_		nothing gets recognized
2008-01-13T12:49:00.000Z	arooni_		mlpug, usually a window pops up with its contnets
2008-01-13T12:49:00.000Z	msl		can you open a terminal and type    dmesg
2008-01-13T12:50:00.000Z	msl	arooni_	dmesg     will show you where the device is located.  ex. /dev/sda
2008-01-13T12:51:00.000Z	arooni_	msl	should i just paste it somewhere
2008-01-13T12:52:00.000Z	msl	arooni_	do you see anything that says [sda] or [sdb]?
2008-01-13T12:53:00.000Z	arooni_	msl	i think so: [   15.336000] Adding 2063840k swap on /dev/sda6.  Priority:-1 extents:1 across:2063840k
2008-01-13T12:55:00.000Z	arooni_	msl	you there?
2008-01-13T12:55:00.000Z	msl	arooni_	I think you are looking too far back.  If you unplug and replug the device, at the very bottom of the dmesg output it should say "usb-storage: device found at ??" and then will show [sda] or [sdb] or similar which is where the device is located
2008-01-13T12:55:00.000Z	arooni_	msl	ah in that case i'm not seeing any such message ... its like ubuntu never sees it :9
2008-01-13T12:57:00.000Z	msl	arooni_	That is weird.  Are you using other USB devices?  And have you ever had it working before?
2008-01-13T12:57:00.000Z	arooni_	msl	no, and yes
2008-01-13T12:58:00.000Z	arooni_	msl	i'm not seeing anything new happen after [3422.xxxx]
2008-01-13T12:58:00.000Z	msl	arooni_	In that case I don't know what is going on.
2008-01-13T12:59:00.000Z	arooni_	msl	hmmmmmmmmmmm oh noes
