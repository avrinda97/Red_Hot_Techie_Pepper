2012-08-06T19:51:00.000Z	Luig1		Hello
2012-08-06T19:52:00.000Z	Luig1		I'm trying to pick a laptop on which to put Ubuntu 12.04. It has to be HP or Lenovo (due to certain blanket discounts I'd be eligible for from those two manufacturers) and the sticking point for me is the graphics card
2012-08-06T19:52:00.000Z	Luig1		I've been burned by Intel graphics before
2012-08-06T19:53:00.000Z	Luig1		So I'd been working under the assumption that nvidia would work best with Ubuntu
2012-08-06T19:53:00.000Z	Luig1		But now I'm starting to wonder if a cheaper AMD board with a Radeon card might not work just as well for graphics purposes
2012-08-06T19:53:00.000Z	Luig1		Does anyone have any input on this?
2012-08-06T19:54:00.000Z	mneptok	Luig1	do you need workstation-like performance? e.g. full 3D hardware rendering?
2012-08-06T19:55:00.000Z	Luig1	mneptok	I want to test new games moving to the platform and I also don't want to get left behind by hardware-accelerated interfaces, as has happened on this machine
2012-08-06T19:57:00.000Z	mneptok	Luig1	i have a Lenovo x120e with an AMD APU (E350). it works fine, but is not a powerhouse laptop. also, last i tried, the proprietary AMD driver did not work at all. however, the FLOSS "radeon" driver does 2D fine, and that's all i need.
2012-08-06T19:58:00.000Z	mneptok	Luig1	also, be aware that Intel graphics have made great strides. ask John Carmack.

2012-08-06T20:05:00.000Z	mneptok	Luig1	it may change your outlook on embedded Intel graphics.
2012-08-06T20:05:00.000Z	mneptok	Luig1	TBH, the AMD APU is the first non-Intel setup i have owned in *years*. Intel stuff has tended to work very well.
2012-08-06T20:09:00.000Z	mneptok	Luig1	your choices were Lenovo and .... HP?
2012-08-06T20:10:00.000Z	mneptok	Luig1	ugh. if it was Dell, they are about to start selling laptops with Ubuntu pre-installed again.
2012-08-06T20:10:00.000Z	Luig1	mneptok	that's where I got mine!
2012-08-06T20:11:00.000Z	mneptok	Luig1	not much i can help with, since i don't need 3D acceleration. but the consensus is that Intel is getting a LOT better.
2012-08-06T20:52:00.000Z	Luig1	mneptok	also mentioned that intel HD is doing fine at this point
