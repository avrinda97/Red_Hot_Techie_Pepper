2012-03-18T00:37:00.000Z	piotrt		hello
2012-03-18T00:37:00.000Z	piotrt		is there a way to control gdm remotely? i would like to access my computer (i.e. log in) without using the keyboard, but for example using public key (like ssh
2012-03-18T00:38:00.000Z	piotrt		the key could be stored on any bluetooth or usb device
2012-03-18T00:39:00.000Z	vlt	piotrt	There must be a native X server way to do this … but x11vnc works.
2012-03-18T00:41:00.000Z	piotrt	vlt	i'm looking to do it locally
2012-03-18T00:43:00.000Z	vlt	piotrt	Then I haven’t understood what you actually want to do.
2012-03-18T00:43:00.000Z	piotrt	vlt	i want to be able to start gnome session (when i'm using gdm for login) without touching the keyboard
2012-03-18T00:45:00.000Z	vlt	piotrt	schnuffle: Without touching keyboard?
2012-03-18T00:45:00.000Z	piotrt	vlt	exactly to be able to run X apps via e.g. ssh or other remote access methods, but on _my_ home computer, not the remote terminal
2012-03-18T00:46:00.000Z	vlt	piotrt	touching keyboard?
2012-03-18T00:46:00.000Z	vlt	piotrt	Without touching keyboard?
2012-03-18T00:47:00.000Z	piotrt	vlt	yes, not touching the keyboard which is attached to it
2012-03-18T00:48:00.000Z	vlt	piotrt	What about a crypted hard drive with key on usb and then auto-login?
2012-03-18T00:48:00.000Z	vlt	piotrt	I don’t understand how “locally” and “remote device” go together.
2012-03-18T00:49:00.000Z	piotrt	vlt	nice idea
2012-03-18T00:49:00.000Z	piotrt	vlt	not locally = to not log in using other X server for display than the one started already on this machine, while accessing the pc remotely
2012-03-18T00:50:00.000Z	vlt	piotrt	You mean the other machine must not use an X server thus x11vnc is no option, right?
2012-03-18T00:50:00.000Z	piotrt	vlt	exactly
