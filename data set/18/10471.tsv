2006-12-21T16:16:00.000Z	racarr	tux	http://kernelnewbies.org/ is a good place to start kernel development
2006-12-21T16:16:00.000Z	racarr	tux	But unless you have been programming for a long time in C don't expect to be able to write a driver anytime soon
2006-12-21T16:17:00.000Z	tux	racarr	thank u
2006-12-21T16:19:00.000Z	tux	racarr	thank u very much
