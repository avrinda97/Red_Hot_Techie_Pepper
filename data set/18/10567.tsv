2006-11-15T07:40:00.000Z	Krazy882		I have installed my HHD into a new machine.  Everything runs great except the NIC.  It is not automatically seen at bootup.  How can I re-run the installer to get the NIC driver?
2006-11-15T07:41:00.000Z	lullabud	Krazy882	 try kudzu
2006-11-15T07:45:00.000Z	lullabud	Krazy882	 do you mean it didn't find it or you don't have it installed?
2006-11-15T07:47:00.000Z	Krazy882	lullabud	 I do not have kudzu installed.  server version
2006-11-15T07:54:00.000Z	lullabud	Krazy882	 apt-get install kudzu ?
2006-11-15T07:54:00.000Z	Krazy882	lullabud	 nope.  no NIC.  don't have it.
2006-11-15T07:56:00.000Z	lullabud	Krazy882	 install it from the cd.
2006-11-15T07:57:00.000Z	lullabud	Krazy882	 exactly.
2006-11-15T08:00:00.000Z	Krazy882	lullabud	 Package kudzu not available.  But it is referenced by another ...
2006-11-15T08:01:00.000Z	lullabud	Krazy882	 huh, you're right.  try hwdata ?
2006-11-15T08:02:00.000Z	lullabud	Krazy882	 honestly, i've had luck just editing /etc/network/interfaces by hand and doing an /etc/init.d/network restart
2006-11-15T08:03:00.000Z	Krazy882	lullabud	 maybe I can use the install CD to make this file for me and then copy it to the HHD?
2006-11-15T08:09:00.000Z	lullabud	Krazy882	 that's definitely an option.  check your /etc/network/interfaces, and your ... um....
2006-11-15T08:10:00.000Z	lullabud	Krazy882	 /etc/modules
2006-11-15T08:23:00.000Z	Krazy882	lullabud	 ok, I got it!!!!  Here is what I did.
2006-11-15T08:23:00.000Z	lullabud	Krazy882	 ah-ha
2006-11-15T08:25:00.000Z	lullabud	Krazy882	 well you did all the hard work so you're the one who deserves the credit :)
2006-11-15T08:25:00.000Z	Krazy882	lullabud	 sometimes all we need is an ear.  you da man!
