2010-10-29T16:20:00.000Z	lea123		Could we install Gnome and KDE both at the same time and not expect any conflicts ?
2010-10-29T16:20:00.000Z	ectospasm	lea123	should be OK
2010-10-29T16:20:00.000Z	ectospasm	lea123	thought you may only use one at a time
2010-10-29T16:20:00.000Z	ectospasm	lea123	but with both installed, you'll be able to use apps in either from either
2010-10-29T16:21:00.000Z	lea123	ectospasm	: But is there a possiblity of and mishap ?
2010-10-29T16:21:00.000Z	ectospasm	lea123	none that I know of
2010-10-29T16:22:00.000Z	ectospasm	lea123	one package must have the packages it depends on installed
2010-10-29T16:30:00.000Z	lea123	ectospasm	: If someone says there are 14 dependencies for installation is that quite a task to handle ?
2010-10-29T16:30:00.000Z	ectospasm	lea123	not usually, the package manager (dpkg/apt, et al.) handles it
2010-10-29T16:31:00.000Z	lea123	ectospasm	:  OK this is the beauty in Ubuntu I suppose - Am i right and not possibly in the other flavors of linux ?
2010-10-29T16:32:00.000Z	ectospasm	lea123	most other distros use some form of package management too
2010-10-29T16:32:00.000Z	ectospasm	lea123	the Debian system is the ancestor to Ubuntu
2010-11-23T11:59:00.000Z	ectospasm	lea123	don't forget that humans hate change. Anything that isn't familiar is booed.  Case in point:  A former roommate HATED MacOSX after having used my Ubuntu installation for nearly a year
2010-11-23T11:59:00.000Z	ectospasm	lea123	Unity isn't ready for prime time
2010-11-23T12:00:00.000Z	ectospasm	lea123	if you're not willing to do some debugging, you shouldn't use it
2010-11-23T12:01:00.000Z	lea123	ectospasm	THats what is the point probably if you don't know debugging don't use Ubuntu maybe..
2010-11-23T12:01:00.000Z	ectospasm	lea123	no, you've got it wrong
