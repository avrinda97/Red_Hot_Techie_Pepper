2008-08-18T00:19:00.000Z	Sitherae	therealnanotube	^__^ thanks
2008-08-18T00:24:00.000Z	Sitherae	therealnanotube	I have it installed but how do I start it?
2008-08-18T00:24:00.000Z	therealnanotube	Sitherae	clamav is a terminal-based program. open a terminal, and you can run "clamscan" with various options.
2008-08-18T00:25:00.000Z	therealnanotube	Sitherae	and of course, "man clamscan" for all those options
2008-08-18T00:25:00.000Z	Sitherae	therealnanotube	I'm a man!
2008-08-18T00:25:00.000Z	therealnanotube	Sitherae	there's also a gui for it, though y ou can try, called "clamtk". if you don't want to deal with the cli
2008-08-18T00:25:00.000Z	therealnanotube	Sitherae	:)
2008-08-18T00:25:00.000Z	Sitherae	therealnanotube	I'll try that thanks :D
2008-08-18T00:26:00.000Z	therealnanotube	Sitherae	good luck, let know if problems. :)
2008-08-18T00:26:00.000Z	Sitherae	therealnanotube	will do
2008-08-18T00:32:00.000Z	Sitherae	therealnanotube	Can it scan another harddrive? Because I have Windows on another harddrive in the same computer.
2008-08-18T00:38:00.000Z	Sitherae	therealnanotube	How do I get it to scan my whole windows harddrive? Its just scanning files in the immediate directory
