2007-06-23T09:30:00.000Z	bullgard4	kravlin	The fact that Ubuntu is on partition 1 and Windows is on partition 3, is no reason for having troubles. The sequence of installing Ubuntu and Windows may be the reason of your trouble.
2007-06-23T09:31:00.000Z	kravlin	bullgard4	I did this before and it worked but it was on seperate hard drives.
2007-06-23T09:32:00.000Z	bullgard4	kravlin	Ubuntu and Windows can coexist on separate drives and on the same drive as well. In latter case they need to be on separate partitions.
2007-06-23T09:34:00.000Z	kravlin	bullgard4	they are. I Used all 4 Physical Partitions on the hard drive. Its a 250 gig drive with the first half being taken up by ubuntu. the next quarter is a fat32 partition so i can transfer files without any major problems and the last quarter is for windows xp.
2007-06-23T09:34:00.000Z	kravlin	bullgard4	afterward is the swap for linux.
2007-06-23T09:34:00.000Z	kravlin	bullgard4	Linux has no problem with it.
2007-06-23T09:35:00.000Z	bullgard4	kravlin	Your arrangement of partitions is not the cause of your windows troubles.
2007-06-23T09:36:00.000Z	kravlin	bullgard4	any idea what else it could be then?
2007-06-23T09:38:00.000Z	bullgard4	kravlin	I have ideas, but too many to list them here. Please pastebin dmesg messages so that one can analyze any error messages in them and advise you.
2007-06-23T09:41:00.000Z	kravlin	bullgard4	I can't pastebin the messages. They happen half way through the boot.
2007-06-23T09:43:00.000Z	bullgard4	kravlin	I do not understand your sentence: "They happen half way through the boot" as English is not my mother's language. Say it in other words.
2007-06-23T09:44:00.000Z	kravlin	bullgard4	Windows reboots during the install. When it does that's when it tells me it has a  disk error and asks me to press a key to restart.
2007-06-23T09:46:00.000Z	bullgard4	kravlin	It is strongly recommended that you first install Windows and Ubuntu afterwards. Have you kept this sequence?
2007-06-23T09:47:00.000Z	kravlin	bullgard4	no. I have been running Ubuntu for a while now and just recently decided to make my system dual-boot. It worked when both were on different hard drives but now it gives me this error. I can fix GRUB after the install if i could just get windows installed.
2007-06-23T09:54:00.000Z	bullgard4	kravlin	Apparently installing both operating systems on the same hard drive places higher requirements to both operating systems. So I recommend to first install Windows and Linux afterwards. This worked for me on two laptops. This also made less trouble in my local computer club. And this is what I have read many times in forums.
2007-06-23T09:56:00.000Z	kravlin	bullgard4	I guess a backup and reformat is my best option. Thanks.
2007-06-23T10:03:00.000Z	bullgard4	kravlin	A backup is advisable. Yes. I am not sure if an explicit reformat is necessary before you start installing Windows. I believe the usual Windows install CDs will format first anyway. But you might ask a more knowledgeable person for that.
2007-06-23T10:04:00.000Z	kravlin	bullgard4	They do format. Its a pain in the butt. Thanks!
