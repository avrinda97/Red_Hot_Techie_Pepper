2008-06-12T19:21:00.000Z	_ZeuZ_		is there any way to import gnome 2.22 to Ubuntu/Kubuntu/Xubuntu? Since I've seen the repos hold 2.20.2.2 instead of the one a partner of mine (ubuntu user) is after...
2008-06-12T19:22:00.000Z	_ZeuZ_		and I can guide you there...
2008-06-12T19:23:00.000Z	_ZeuZ_		then allow the plugin, and you're done
2008-06-12T19:23:00.000Z	_ZeuZ_		If you did set the number of horizontal desktops to4, and activated the cube plugin, then you're done. simply use the key combination you chose
2008-06-12T19:25:00.000Z	_ZeuZ_		ChampS``, I can't really guide you to install it through Ubuntu/Kubuntu/Xubuntu GUI, because it's easy enough, and I'm a Debian user...
2008-06-12T19:25:00.000Z	bobstro	_ZeuZ_	 compiz seems to get pulled in automatically, at least for all my buddies lately. what normally pulls it in ?
2008-06-12T19:25:00.000Z	_ZeuZ_	bobstro	what do you mean with that? I repeat, I do not use Ubuntu, but Debian... Though, installation is easy in Ubuntu
2008-06-12T19:26:00.000Z	bobstro	_ZeuZ_	 ah, no big deal. it's just that compiz always seems to be there with latest ubuntu. i keep telling friends to install it and it's already there.
2008-06-12T19:26:00.000Z	_ZeuZ_	bobstro	It's integrated afaik
2008-06-12T19:26:00.000Z	bobstro	_ZeuZ_	 there's a dependency that they must be installing by default. maybe accelerated drivers (nvidia-glx-new) pull it in?
2008-06-12T19:27:00.000Z	bobstro	_ZeuZ_	 so lately i just tell them to try enabling advanced effects in little appearance preference panel and it works.
2008-06-12T19:27:00.000Z	_ZeuZ_	bobstro	dunno, once again I say, i do not use ubbuntu/*INSERT LETTER HERE*buntu
2008-06-12T19:28:00.000Z	bobstro	_ZeuZ_	 ok. i was mostly debian myself until last year or so.
2008-06-12T19:28:00.000Z	_ZeuZ_	bobstro	then why did you migrate? xD
2008-06-12T19:29:00.000Z	bobstro	_ZeuZ_	 well, my server is still debian. i just found it easier to get friends going with ubuntu as "support guy".
2008-06-12T19:30:00.000Z	bobstro	_ZeuZ_	 but i still consider ubu "offspring of debian" :)
2008-06-12T19:30:00.000Z	_ZeuZ_	bobstro	my mates at debian-es conquire that Ubuntu creates people afraid of consoles/ttys
2008-06-12T19:31:00.000Z	bobstro	_ZeuZ_	 well... for a lot of people that may be just as well. :) i don't want mom & dad playing under there.
