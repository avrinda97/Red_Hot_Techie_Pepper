2008-01-13T15:24:00.000Z	Ximal		hey guys.. for some reason when I installed gnash my youtube started screwing up..
2008-01-13T15:25:00.000Z	Ximal		is there a way to download an official deb file for flash retail ? not the generic crap ?
2008-01-13T15:25:00.000Z	jesse	Ximal	flash retail?
2008-01-13T15:28:00.000Z	jesse	Ximal	yes, the package is called flashplugin-nonfree
2008-01-13T15:28:00.000Z	jesse	Ximal	uninstall gnash first.
2008-01-13T15:35:00.000Z	jesse	Ximal	yes
2008-01-13T15:38:00.000Z	jesse	Ximal	yup, thats a problem thats yet to be fixed. i had that problem as well, ill find the solution... wherever i put it.
2008-01-13T15:38:00.000Z	jesse	Ximal	from adobe?
2008-01-13T15:39:00.000Z	jesse	Ximal	flash isnt open source, so you dont have to compile it.
2008-01-13T15:39:00.000Z	jesse	Ximal	there is an easy solution to your problem, i just have to remember what it was.
2008-01-13T15:40:00.000Z	jesse	Ximal	here it is: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=634404 ("Schalken" is me BTW)
2008-01-13T15:41:00.000Z	jesse	Ximal	there was a working package posted by "daradib
2008-01-13T15:44:00.000Z	jesse	Ximal	work?
2008-01-13T15:45:00.000Z	jesse	Ximal	this deb should work: http://launchpadlibrarian.net/10761023/flashplugin-nonfree_9.0.115.0ubuntu2_i386.deb
2008-01-13T15:45:00.000Z	jesse	Ximal	oh, dont bother using Adobe's stuff directly unless you REALLY cant find DEB (which i just pointed you to for the second time)
2008-01-13T15:47:00.000Z	jesse	Ximal	use the right one for your archietecture. are you on 64bit, 32bit or PPC?
2008-01-13T15:47:00.000Z	jesse	Ximal	use this one then: http://launchpadlibrarian.net/10804892/flashplugin-nonfree_9.0.115.0ubuntu2_amd64.deb
2008-01-13T15:47:00.000Z	jesse	Ximal	i am on 64bit as well and thats the deb i used.
