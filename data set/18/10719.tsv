2006-12-04T09:51:00.000Z	Raskall		This is crazy. I am on a train running 150 km/h and connected via (E)GPRS/UMTS and NX rocks. NX is incredible
2006-12-04T09:51:00.000Z	Raskall		I am used to running ssh sessions over this link and it is extremely slow, but NX? It's almost just as sitting on a local console
2006-12-04T09:52:00.000Z	nothlit	Raskall	are you using NoMachine FreeNX or 2X's implementation?
2006-12-04T09:54:00.000Z	Raskall	nothlit	the one from www.nomachine.com.
2006-12-04T09:57:00.000Z	nothlit	Raskall	you're running 64bit?
2006-12-04T09:59:00.000Z	Raskall	nothlit	I am running 64bit natively, yes. But the nx server is running in a chroot jail
2006-12-04T10:00:00.000Z	nothlit	Raskall	do you find the performance outweighs the difficulties? especially with binaries?
2006-12-04T10:01:00.000Z	Raskall	nothlit	I had no difficulties with anything after I ditched freenx
2006-12-04T10:02:00.000Z	nothlit	Raskall	does linux32 work for anything you might need?
2006-12-04T10:02:00.000Z	nothlit	Raskall	so you haven't installed flash or any other closed source binaries or had any troubles with them?
2006-12-04T10:04:00.000Z	Raskall	nothlit	I am running firefox with flash in 32bit jail. The flash plugin had to be copied to the firefox plugins directory manually.
2006-12-04T10:05:00.000Z	nothlit	Raskall	ahh
2006-12-04T10:05:00.000Z	Raskall	nothlit	it didnt work with apt-get. And I had to download the tarball from adobe and copy the plugin files manually
2006-12-04T10:05:00.000Z	nothlit	Raskall	yeah nx is supposed to be usable over dialup with smoothscrolling enabled in browsers
2006-12-04T10:06:00.000Z	nothlit	Raskall	can the server you're using access :0? or do you have to use a separate x session?
2006-12-04T10:10:00.000Z	Raskall	nothlit	I am running X both in the native 64bit os and the chroot jail. Can use X both locally on the server and via NX
2006-12-04T10:11:00.000Z	nothlit	Raskall	im asking if the nx client actually views the local display (as in display :0)or creates a new one
2006-12-04T10:12:00.000Z	Raskall	nothlit	ahh.. it creates a new one
