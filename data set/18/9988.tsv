2007-12-04T07:42:00.000Z	luke_		I have a driver running right now that I need to reconfig. I can't "make" the new driver because it says that the driver is already enabled in the kernel. I'm pretty lost right now as to what I need to do, any help would be amazing.
2007-12-04T07:42:00.000Z	kelsin	luke_	what do you mean by reconfig?
2007-12-04T07:44:00.000Z	luke_	kelsin	, ya get what I mean? I can't make the new driver because it says the old driver is already enabled in the kernel.
2007-12-04T07:46:00.000Z	kelsin	luke_	if you really need to compile a driver that's included in the ubuntu kernel you probably need to custom compile your kernel as well, what driver is this?
2007-12-04T07:47:00.000Z	luke_	kelsin	, it's a driver for an orinoco classic gold wifi card. it is needed to get monitor mode to run.
2007-12-04T07:48:00.000Z	luke_	kelsin	, i just jumped the gun and ran make on the file before i edited the config file so now it gives me the error:  This driver is already enabled in the kernel.
2007-12-04T07:49:00.000Z	kelsin	luke_	if you just ran make and not make install or anything else it shouldn't have done anything you can't reverse with make distclean (if this is a nicely made makefile)
2007-12-04T07:53:00.000Z	luke_	kelsin	, no rule to support make clean or make distclean
2007-12-04T08:08:00.000Z	luke_	kelsin	any ideas?
2007-12-04T08:09:00.000Z	kelsin	luke_	unfortunately no, I have no experience with that driver
2007-12-04T08:10:00.000Z	luke_	kelsin	, besides a make clean or make install. what else is there to do in order to disable to installed driver so i can install the new?
2007-12-04T08:10:00.000Z	kelsin	luke_	I have no idea, sorry
2007-12-04T08:10:00.000Z	luke_	kelsin	thanks anyways, much appreciated for the effort.
2007-12-04T08:14:00.000Z	kelsin	luke_	which is a good thing
2007-12-04T08:14:00.000Z	luke_	kelsin	, why a good thing?
2007-12-04T08:15:00.000Z	kelsin	luke_	removing drivers that are in use can lead to bad things
2007-12-04T08:16:00.000Z	luke_	kelsin	, well its for a pcmcia wifi card that just needs monitor mode enabled in a line of code. i have the correctly configd driver right here just waiting to be installed after the original one is disabled
2007-12-04T08:16:00.000Z	kelsin	luke_	dude, honestly I have no idea what you need to do, I'm sorry
