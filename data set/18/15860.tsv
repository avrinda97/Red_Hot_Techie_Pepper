2005-01-14T17:47:00.000Z	funky		hi
2005-01-14T17:47:00.000Z	funky		what dirs are "protected" when i perform an apt-get remove package ?
2005-01-14T17:48:00.000Z	funky		 /etc and anymore ?
2005-01-14T17:49:00.000Z	topyl1	funky	apt-get remove doesn't remove configuration unless you use --purge
2005-01-14T17:49:00.000Z	topyl1	funky	some packages may leave something in /var as well
2005-01-14T17:50:00.000Z	funky	topyl1	do you know where can i set that ?
2005-01-14T17:50:00.000Z	topyl1	funky	you mean --purge? it's just an apt-get option
2005-01-14T17:55:00.000Z	funky	topyl1	yes, i know --purgue, but i mean how to select the dirs where files stored in, wont be deleted when i'll do an apt-get remove
2005-01-14T17:56:00.000Z	funky	topyl1	you got it ?
2005-01-14T17:56:00.000Z	topyl1	funky	ah. don't know about that. if the dir is empty after package removal, dpkg will remove it
2005-01-14T17:57:00.000Z	topyl1	funky	if that's what you mean :)
2005-01-14T17:59:00.000Z	funky	topyl1	imagine i have got X package installed and that packages stores files in /opt/etc (for example), i dont want files stored in that dir will be removed when i remove the package, must exist somewhere to configure that
2005-01-14T17:59:00.000Z	funky	topyl1	in gentoo exits
2005-01-14T06:01:00.000Z	topyl1	funky	i see. don't know. debian installs nothing in /opt though
2005-01-14T06:01:00.000Z	funky	topyl1	it was just an example
2005-01-14T06:02:00.000Z	topyl1	funky	i guess only config files in /etc and files you edit manually are safe
2005-01-14T06:04:00.000Z	funky	topyl1	ill see apt-howto
2005-01-14T06:04:00.000Z	topyl1	funky	yes. there's also one on dpkg internals iirc
