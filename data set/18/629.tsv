2011-12-25T02:48:00.000Z	Raliegh		BTW thanks for the help so far guys. ^^
2011-12-25T02:49:00.000Z	Raliegh		Segmentation faults on everything apt-get
2011-12-25T02:49:00.000Z	Raliegh		Segmentation faultsts... 0%
2011-12-25T02:51:00.000Z	Raliegh		freed *
2011-12-25T02:52:00.000Z	Raliegh		Did apt-get --purge remove ubuntu-desktop but... It only removed one package that was 64KB? That can't be right.
2011-12-25T02:53:00.000Z	Raliegh		0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded. Nothin', haha.
2011-12-25T02:55:00.000Z	Raliegh		K, ran that remove command (even though I'm not sure what it did except remove anything with extension .bin).
2011-12-25T02:56:00.000Z	Raliegh		Oh I coulda done that after reboot, didn't know that is what you were getting at. usr13, I've got it installed but my memory is freed now after my reboot. Just trying to uninstall Gnome entirely and properly before I go researching ffmpeg (I think it was)
2011-12-25T02:58:00.000Z	Raliegh		I know for a fact it didn't properly dispose of Gnome.
2011-12-25T02:58:00.000Z	peterrus	Raliegh	shouldnt you do apt-get --purge remove ?
2011-12-25T03:00:00.000Z	peterrus	Raliegh	or you might try sudo apt-get remove --purge gnome-*
2011-12-25T03:01:00.000Z	Raliegh	peterrus	that freed 155MB, but I'm pretty sure gnome installed like 1.5GB
2011-12-25T03:01:00.000Z	peterrus	Raliegh	and now do apt-get autoremove?
2011-12-25T03:05:00.000Z	peterrus	Raliegh	or you could just install ubuntu server ;)
2011-12-25T03:06:00.000Z	Raliegh	peterrus	Do what? I normally do everything by SSH to my server. "Ubuntu server" is kind of a broad name... What is it? Lol.
2011-12-25T03:07:00.000Z	peterrus	Raliegh	its ubuntu minus the desktop environment
2011-12-25T03:08:00.000Z	peterrus	Raliegh	nope you have the regular ubuntu
