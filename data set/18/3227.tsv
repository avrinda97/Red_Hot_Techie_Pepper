2009-11-12T14:54:00.000Z	Warod-		now, I have a little task for you. Please go to www.ubuntu.com with w3m and use it to download a server edition from a mirror of your choise. And after that come tell me why on earth the download site was sabotaged in such a way that it's impossible to download a single damn CD image with non javascript browser!!
2009-11-12T14:56:00.000Z	DasEi	Warod-	no problem here : http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download-server
2009-11-12T14:57:00.000Z	Warod-	DasEi	Did you manage to download it with w3m?
2009-11-12T14:58:00.000Z	DasEi	Warod-	no, just by browser
2009-11-12T14:58:00.000Z	Warod-	DasEi	My point exactly.
2009-11-12T14:58:00.000Z	DasEi	Warod-	second, trying now
2009-11-12T14:58:00.000Z	Warod-	DasEi	How about a scenario where I NEED to get the ISO from console...
2009-11-12T14:59:00.000Z	Warod-	DasEi	with SSH
2009-11-12T14:59:00.000Z	Warod-	DasEi	I canno
2009-11-12T14:59:00.000Z	DasEi	Warod-	use wget or curl fro a http-server
2009-11-12T14:59:00.000Z	Warod-	DasEi	Getting the exact download link is a bit difficult though
2009-11-12T15:00:00.000Z	DasEi	Warod-	second
2009-11-12T15:01:00.000Z	Warod-	DasEi	Ofcourse I remember the url for funet FTP server where I can download it, but why did they broke the website such way?
2009-11-12T15:02:00.000Z	DasEi	Warod-	which country / version exactly ? server 64 bit ?
2009-11-12T15:04:00.000Z	Warod-	DasEi	never mind.. though I'd like to see the old system that actually tells you the download location and provides a working link too directly to the file. didn't get that now with Finland / 64bit choises.
2009-11-12T15:06:00.000Z	DasEi	Warod-	http://www.nic.funet.fi/pub/mirrors/releases.ubuntu.com/karmic/ubuntu-9.10-server-amd64.iso
2009-11-12T15:07:00.000Z	Warod-	DasEi	Yeah, I downloaded it already... As I said, I remember the url. :)
2009-11-12T15:07:00.000Z	Warod-	DasEi	My point is, why to make such a site that makes it more difficult to find out the URL.
