2005-06-12T10:54:00.000Z	nalioth	tandy	you answered your own question
2005-06-12T10:55:00.000Z	tandy	nalioth	no where is about:config ...im not familair with firefox settings
2005-06-12T10:55:00.000Z	tandy	nalioth	dont really knwo wut that means :/
2005-06-12T10:55:00.000Z	nalioth	tandy	put "about:config" in your address bar
2005-06-12T10:55:00.000Z	nalioth	tandy	in place of www.microsoft.com
2005-06-12T10:55:00.000Z	tandy	nalioth	oh lol
2005-06-12T10:56:00.000Z	nalioth	tandy	then you can try the old standby about:mozilla
2005-06-12T10:56:00.000Z	tandy	nalioth	ok got it..thanks..i thought that was a config file somewhere hehe
2005-06-12T10:58:00.000Z	nalioth	tandy	there is a config file somewhere, but its easier in the about:config manner
2005-06-12T10:59:00.000Z	tandy	nalioth	yeah i didnt think it was that easy thast awesome
2005-06-12T11:00:00.000Z	nalioth	tandy	there are (via google) all kind of ways to "pimp" your firefox via about:config (and as many ways to bugger it)
2005-06-12T11:01:00.000Z	tandy	nalioth	hehe, i just wanted to download an extension and because of this numbering system with ubuntu i couldnt ge on the site
2005-06-12T11:01:00.000Z	nalioth	tandy	yes the ubuntu-devs are out of mountain dew or something
2005-06-12T11:03:00.000Z	tandy	nalioth	hey as long as the security updates are there its fine with me :)
2005-06-12T11:04:00.000Z	nalioth	tandy	yup
