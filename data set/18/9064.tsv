2009-03-10T16:48:00.000Z	perlmonkey		how do I get mysqld to start up automatically
2009-03-10T16:48:00.000Z	jrib	perlmonkey	install it
2009-03-10T16:49:00.000Z	perlmonkey	jrib	it is installed, but its not starting automatically on start up
2009-03-10T16:49:00.000Z	jrib	perlmonkey	did you install it using apt?
2009-03-10T16:50:00.000Z	perlmonkey	jrib	no i installed it with mythubuntu live cd
2009-03-10T16:50:00.000Z	jrib	perlmonkey	did you use apt to install a package from the repositories?  What package?
2009-03-10T16:51:00.000Z	perlmonkey	jrib	after installing from the cd i did do an apt-get update and upgrade
2009-03-10T16:51:00.000Z	jrib	perlmonkey	so you chose to install the server during the install?
2009-03-10T16:51:00.000Z	perlmonkey	jrib	with mythubuntu mysqld is installed by default as its required to use mythtv
2009-03-10T16:52:00.000Z	jrib	perlmonkey	#ubuntu-mythtv as I'm not familiar with mythbuntu then.  If they just use the ubuntu package, it should be sarting by default though
2009-03-10T16:53:00.000Z	perlmonkey	jrib	ok thanks
2009-03-15T17:33:00.000Z	jrib	perlmonkey	not really.  Do you understand what it does?
2009-03-15T17:33:00.000Z	perlmonkey	jrib	no clue
2009-03-15T17:34:00.000Z	jrib	perlmonkey	setgid on a directory will just cause files created under that directory to have the same group
2009-03-15T17:38:00.000Z	perlmonkey	jrib	oh i see
2009-03-15T17:39:00.000Z	perlmonkey	jrib	do you know how can I set the permissions back to ï»¿drwxr-xr-x?
2009-03-15T17:39:00.000Z	jrib	perlmonkey	chmod g-s ~
2009-03-15T17:40:00.000Z	perlmonkey	jrib	many thanks, it eluded me
