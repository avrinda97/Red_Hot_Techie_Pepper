2008-11-06T10:24:00.000Z	pangloss	minion007	its going to me hard if you do not have direct access to the computer you want to get working with wireless, we might have to cut firmware and things like that
2008-11-06T10:24:00.000Z	pangloss	minion007	id suggest coming back when you have the computer in front of you and some time
2008-11-06T10:26:00.000Z	minion007	pangloss	i will do that, thannks for all your help.
