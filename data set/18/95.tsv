2012-09-18T09:07:00.000Z	cfhowlett	ramprasadgk	better to try lubuntu or xubuntu
2012-09-18T09:08:00.000Z	cfhowlett	ramprasadgk	they are both good for low spec systems
2012-09-18T09:09:00.000Z	cfhowlett	ramprasadgk	search for "xubuntu download" or "lubuntu download"
2012-09-18T09:10:00.000Z	cfhowlett	ramprasadgk	I agree with Deutopia, xubuntu is quite nice
2012-09-18T09:18:00.000Z	cfhowlett	ramprasadgk	I think the browser is firefox.  If not, you can install and use ffox.
2012-09-18T09:23:00.000Z	cfhowlett	ramprasadgk	good luck.  enjoy.
2012-09-19T14:41:00.000Z	cfhowlett	ramprasadgk	are you sure you have to use the b43 method?  I installed my broadcom driver directly from the ubuntu iso
2012-09-19T14:43:00.000Z	cfhowlett	ramprasadgk	then you're misinformed...
2012-09-19T14:43:00.000Z	cfhowlett	ramprasadgk	same chipset no tar files to mess with on my dell 1545
2012-09-19T14:45:00.000Z	cfhowlett	ramprasadgk	I've successfully used the "No Internet Access" option with ZERO issues  http://turbolinux.org/2011/07/ubuntu-broadcom-bcm43xx-chipset-pci/
2012-09-19T14:45:00.000Z	cfhowlett	ramprasadgk	at least take a look.
2012-09-26T08:12:00.000Z	cfhowlett	ramprasadgk	did you get wifi working?
2012-09-26T08:14:00.000Z	cfhowlett	ramprasadgk	ubuntu magic!
2012-09-26T08:15:00.000Z	ramprasadgk	cfhowlett	now i am stuck with enabling quickedit mode
2012-09-26T08:16:00.000Z	cfhowlett	ramprasadgk	definitely not my area.  sorry.  Stay in channel and persevere.
