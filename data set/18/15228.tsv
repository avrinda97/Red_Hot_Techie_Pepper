2005-04-21T14:09:00.000Z	stevenj	kkathman	ohh thanks
2005-04-21T14:12:00.000Z	kkathman	stevenj	not sure I understand what you are trying to do....did you have warty installed before?
2005-04-21T14:13:00.000Z	stevenj	kkathman	hoary clean...then I followed the  http://ubuntuguide.org/ and replaced the repos file
2005-04-21T14:14:00.000Z	kkathman	stevenj	ok and whats your question?
2005-04-21T14:14:00.000Z	stevenj	kkathman	oh is that a good thing to do?
2005-04-21T14:15:00.000Z	kkathman	stevenj	steven what I did, was a hoary clean install also, and updated each day till the final release. Then I went into my sources.list and uncommented out the two lines at the top of the file that were indicated.
2005-04-21T14:16:00.000Z	stevenj	kkathman	however, if you want bluefish, gnomebaker, etc., you have uncomment the others at the bottom...but I don't know enough to know...if updating from there is wise
2005-04-21T14:17:00.000Z	kkathman	stevenj	well, you just got to know the repository differences. And then just be careful what you install, and be sure you arent overwriting a previous version of something
2005-04-21T14:18:00.000Z	stevenj	kkathman	hmm ok thanks
2005-04-21T14:18:00.000Z	kkathman	stevenj	in general you should be ok...the universe, is probably what you are referring to or possibly multiverse?
2005-04-21T14:18:00.000Z	stevenj	kkathman	yes
2005-04-21T14:19:00.000Z	stevenj	kkathman	have tried OpenOffice 2?
2005-04-21T14:19:00.000Z	kkathman	stevenj	as long as the source is Ubuntu..you are fine.  but as usual, the licensing and support varies depending on what repos the package is in
2005-04-21T14:19:00.000Z	kkathman	stevenj	this will help you I think:  http://www.ubuntulinux.org/ubuntu/components/document_view
2005-04-21T14:20:00.000Z	stevenj	kkathman	thanks
