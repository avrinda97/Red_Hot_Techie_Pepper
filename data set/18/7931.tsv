2007-10-24T13:31:00.000Z	CCB0x45		hey, I used ndisgtk to install a wireless pci card
2007-10-24T13:31:00.000Z	CCB0x45		and it says hardware present
2007-10-24T13:31:00.000Z	CCB0x45		but no networks still show up
2007-10-24T13:33:00.000Z	CCB0x45		anyone know why I have no wireless networks showing up? I installed the inf with ndis
2007-10-24T13:33:00.000Z	CCB0x45		and it says hardware installed
2007-10-24T13:33:00.000Z	kalin	CCB0x45	how did you set it up to even scan for wireless networks?
2007-10-24T13:34:00.000Z	CCB0x45	kalin	well I am jus pressing the little computers in the top right
2007-10-24T13:34:00.000Z	kalin	CCB0x45	hmm, yeah.. GG interface has changed.. 6.x used to just show a list for me, and a different config screen, iirc
2007-10-24T13:35:00.000Z	kalin	CCB0x45	but i didn't mess with it much, it worked straight up, gg hasn't worked at all and is providing no feedback for me
2007-10-24T13:35:00.000Z	CCB0x45	kalin	hmm gg is my first one ive tried
2007-10-24T13:35:00.000Z	kalin	CCB0x45	ah, too bad :(
2007-10-24T13:38:00.000Z	CCB0x45	kalin	so basically no wireless networks show up for you?
2007-10-24T13:39:00.000Z	kalin	CCB0x45	yeah, nothing shows up; i haven't tried ndis yet
2007-10-24T13:39:00.000Z	kalin	CCB0x45	i dont know what ndis is ;/
2007-10-24T13:40:00.000Z	kalin	CCB0x45	aye?
2007-10-24T13:41:00.000Z	kalin	CCB0x45	hmm, that's weird..
2007-10-24T13:41:00.000Z	kalin	CCB0x45	for me it just does nothing.. there is no feedback, the dialog just accepts the data and closes
2007-10-24T13:41:00.000Z	kalin	CCB0x45	anything in your /var/log/syslog?
