2012-09-27T08:52:00.000Z	oldskool_		Well I am using kvm and virt-manager on my headless vm server.... I have two phsical hd's and one is partitioned into sections that I want my vm's to run on so they are not running on the same drive that is running the actual vm server.... does that make sense?
2012-09-27T08:53:00.000Z	oldskool_		midnight* rather
2012-09-27T08:54:00.000Z	oldskool_		I always feel so dirty and used when I ask questions in the main channel...
2012-09-27T08:55:00.000Z	oldskool_		No what I mean is this... Won't i loose performance if I am running a vm server and vm's on the same hd because they are both using the same spindle? Wouldn't it more efficent if I have my vm's on a seperate drive ?
2012-09-27T08:56:00.000Z	oldskool_		Which comes to my real question... I want to point to this other drive to create my vm's on but can't seem to find a method to do this...
2012-09-27T08:57:00.000Z	oldskool_		I have server grade hd's...
2012-09-27T08:57:00.000Z	oldskool_		I wanted to get ssd's
2012-09-27T08:57:00.000Z	oldskool_		but others said not to as they are still unreliable
2012-09-27T08:58:00.000Z	oldskool_		I do have sda3 support too
2012-09-27T08:58:00.000Z	oldskool_		sata 3 rather
2012-09-27T08:58:00.000Z	ferni	oldskool_	create a new storage pool with virt-manager and relocate the vms disk image there
2012-09-27T08:59:00.000Z	oldskool_	ferni	So I can just relocate the image there?
2012-09-27T09:00:00.000Z	ferni	oldskool_	if you have the vm disk images as a image file its just remove that drive from vm and relocate it (you might need to refresh storage pools) and then add the image back from the new pool
2012-09-27T09:02:00.000Z	oldskool_	ferni	You mean if I allocated it? I did not allocate the space I just created a image... So I located the image and move it to a temp folder than create a storage pool with the 2nd hard drive and copy the image onto that drive?
2012-09-27T09:03:00.000Z	oldskool_	ferni	That's what I have been told too
2012-09-27T09:03:00.000Z	oldskool_	ferni	and since this was a server running a business didn't want the trouble
2012-09-27T09:05:00.000Z	ferni	oldskool_	yeas, just copy the file to new location, where the new storage pool is
2012-09-27T09:08:00.000Z	oldskool_	ferni	Like "whoa" dude ;)
