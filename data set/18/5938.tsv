2008-07-29T17:04:00.000Z	Terminator		hello
2008-07-29T17:04:00.000Z	Terminator		some1 else is having a problem with ubuntu
2008-07-29T17:04:00.000Z	Terminator		I set in menu.lst the default to "saved" so that it automatically starts windows at startup and not ubuntu
2008-07-29T17:04:00.000Z	Terminator		now he updated
2008-07-29T17:05:00.000Z	Terminator		and it auto-starts memtest..
2008-07-29T17:05:00.000Z	Terminator		any ideas
2008-07-29T17:05:00.000Z	Terminator		??
2008-07-29T17:06:00.000Z	DJones	Terminator	You need to edit your menu.lst and change the number of the entry to start, if the kernel has been updated, there'll be a new entry at the top which means that windows will have moved one place further down
2008-07-29T17:07:00.000Z	Terminator		Well DJones I didnt set a number, but I set the default to "saved" and windows xp is the savededault I think..
2008-07-29T17:09:00.000Z	DJones	Terminator	It might just be that the numbers/positions have changed after an update and the saved position hasn't been updated and will manually need changing
2008-07-29T17:11:00.000Z	Terminator	DJones	can I post it in a pastebin, so you could take a look?
2008-07-29T17:11:00.000Z	Terminator		well, the question was more if he would look
2008-07-29T17:11:00.000Z	Terminator		;)
2008-07-29T17:12:00.000Z	DJones	Terminator	I'm just about to go away from the computer for 15 minutes, put it in pastebin though, i'm sure somebody will be able to help, if not, I'll have a look in a bit

2008-07-29T17:22:00.000Z	Terminator		if any1 can help me get it to auto start windows it would be greatly appreciated
2008-07-29T17:26:00.000Z	Terminator		http://paste.ubuntu.com/31711/  << Need helping getting windows to start first instead of memtest DJones
2008-07-29T17:30:00.000Z	DJones	Terminator	As DistroJockey just suggested, I'd change to 6 or maybe 7
