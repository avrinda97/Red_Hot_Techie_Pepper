2009-06-30T07:07:00.000Z	giaco		hello
2009-06-30T07:07:00.000Z	giaco		I've rebooted my laptop and now my sound is gone
2009-06-30T07:07:00.000Z	giaco		I've a mute laptop after a reboot
2009-06-30T07:08:00.000Z	therussianjig	giaco	is PA running?
2009-06-30T07:09:00.000Z	giaco	therussianjig	let me check it
2009-06-30T07:09:00.000Z	giaco	therussianjig	3781 ?        00:00:14 pulseaudio yes it's running
2009-06-30T07:09:00.000Z	therussianjig	giaco	this sounds dumb but did you check the mixer and make sure all the channels are up?
2009-06-30T07:10:00.000Z	giaco	therussianjig	all the channels are fired up
2009-06-30T07:10:00.000Z	therussianjig	giaco	What is your active device
2009-06-30T07:11:00.000Z	giaco	therussianjig	what do you mean?
2009-06-30T07:11:00.000Z	therussianjig	giaco	In the mixer there is a drop-down for different devices....it might have been switched to an internal speaker
2009-06-30T07:12:00.000Z	giaco	therussianjig	I've always used alsamixer, actually I don't know where's the gui one, lol
2009-06-30T07:16:00.000Z	giaco	therussianjig	I've found a "chip name"
2009-06-30T07:16:00.000Z	giaco		not a device name
2009-06-30T07:16:00.000Z	therussianjig	giaco	I had a simiair problem awhile ago and 'sudo killall pulseaudio' worked but I can't say why, or if it will work in your case
2009-06-30T07:18:00.000Z	giaco	therussianjig	solved
2009-06-30T07:18:00.000Z	giaco		It was pulseaudio
2009-06-30T07:19:00.000Z	therussianjig	giaco	for a permanate fix, add a boot up line that disables pulse audio
