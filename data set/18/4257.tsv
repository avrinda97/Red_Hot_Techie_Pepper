2009-05-09T01:43:00.000Z	trirnoth		Soren: I do it by number of characters in a filename. Just my preference.
2009-05-09T01:45:00.000Z	trirnoth		Last shot. Anyone interested in a syslog-ng problem before I leave for the day?
2009-05-09T01:46:00.000Z	trirnoth		Sorry, did earlier.
2009-05-09T01:46:00.000Z	Gnea	trirnoth	didn't now.
2009-05-09T01:47:00.000Z	trirnoth	Gnea	NP. was a while ago. Used http://www.quietearth.us/articles/2006/09/27/Logging-remote-host-to-specific-logfile-with-syslogng to set up a router logging to my 9.04 server.
2009-05-09T01:47:00.000Z	Gnea	trirnoth	mkay, and..?
2009-05-09T01:48:00.000Z	Gnea	trirnoth	could you please pastebin your syslog-ng.conf?
2009-05-09T01:52:00.000Z	Gnea	trirnoth	okay, you still need to tell syslog-ng to listen on the port
2009-05-09T01:52:00.000Z	Gnea	trirnoth	check lines 91-93
2009-05-09T01:53:00.000Z	Gnea	trirnoth	i see you made a whole new source, but have you verified it's listening?
2009-05-09T01:54:00.000Z	trirnoth	Gnea	thought that my lines 96 overrode 91-93 .... uncommented anyway.
2009-05-09T01:54:00.000Z	trirnoth	Gnea	udp        0      0 0.0.0.0:514             0.0.0.0:*
2009-05-09T01:55:00.000Z	Gnea	trirnoth	aaah okay - i see what happened - you created a source but you never plugged it into anything at the bottom of the config
2009-05-09T01:55:00.000Z	trirnoth	Gnea	uncommenting line 93 and restarted didn't help ..... reading your new comment now.
2009-05-09T01:55:00.000Z	Gnea	trirnoth	if you search for s_all, you'll see where it's used - and note that s_net is not
2009-05-09T01:56:00.000Z	trirnoth	Gnea	crap. I see it.
2009-05-09T01:56:00.000Z	Gnea	trirnoth	i bet, if you comment out s_net, it'll start working - the s_net and s_all are clobbering each other, which is probably why it isn't working just yet
2009-05-09T02:01:00.000Z	trirnoth	Gnea	AWESOME! thanks. good eye.
