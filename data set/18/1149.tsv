2011-05-15T21:32:00.000Z	dstepanovic		hello.. i'm using 11.04 but i'm having trouble with the flash plugin and especially with viewing flash videos (like youtube).. it's really slow and uses a lot of CPU power.. while on windows i don't have any problems.. anyone have an idea what could be wrong??
2011-05-15T21:33:00.000Z	Un_n0wn	dstepanovic	install gpu drivers, but if you use ati evergreen cards or newer ones you can't fix this. ATI drivers are shit..

2011-05-15T21:34:00.000Z	dstepanovic	Un_n0wn	i did install the drivers, and i indeed have an ati radeon x1600 pro card.. does this mean the problem can't be fixed?
2011-05-15T21:35:00.000Z	Un_n0wn	dstepanovic	which ubuntu version are you using?
2011-05-15T21:35:00.000Z	dstepanovic	Un_n0wn	11.04
2011-05-15T21:37:00.000Z	dstepanovic	Un_n0wn	any idea??
2011-05-15T21:38:00.000Z	Un_n0wn	dstepanovic	there is a new r300g which is based on Gallium3d, but 11.04, I think, uses radeon driver, which possibly has worse performance. Read https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RadeonDriver
2011-05-15T21:38:00.000Z	Un_n0wn	dstepanovic	under Getting better 3D support section :)
2011-05-15T21:39:00.000Z	dstepanovic	Un_n0wn	ok thanks I'll try that :)
2011-05-15T21:39:00.000Z	Un_n0wn	dstepanovic	search in google how to see if it is running. If it is - you can't do anything, if it doesn't run then install it.
2011-05-15T21:39:00.000Z	Un_n0wn	dstepanovic	but ati drivers are shitty, you should exchange your card to nvidia one or intel.
2011-05-15T21:40:00.000Z	dstepanovic	Un_n0wn	i need a whole new computer :) but i think it's kinda weak of Ubuntu that they don't offer good support for all kinds of cards like windows does
2011-05-15T21:41:00.000Z	Un_n0wn	dstepanovic	there is small number of devs working on open source drivers for ati cards and amd doesn't release good docs so opensource devs could dev them faster.
2011-05-15T21:41:00.000Z	Un_n0wn		damn amd.
2011-05-15T21:42:00.000Z	dstepanovic	Un_n0wn	i understand.. but form a user's point of view it's very user-unfriendly :) but thank's for the support i'll look into what you said
2011-05-15T21:43:00.000Z	Un_n0wn	dstepanovic	I have hd 5670 and it runs like nvidia 7000. lol
