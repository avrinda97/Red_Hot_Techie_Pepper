2008-01-02T16:19:00.000Z	Sonja		i'll do what ikonia recommends. it's just a lot of work
2008-01-02T16:20:00.000Z	Sonja		yup only firefox

2008-01-02T16:21:00.000Z	Sonja		what does startup mean?
2008-01-02T16:21:00.000Z	Sonja		i can't even open firefox
2008-01-02T16:21:00.000Z	Sonja		ok let me try safe mode
2008-01-02T16:22:00.000Z	Sonja		i'm listening to what other people have to say. you're not the only one in here ikonia :)
2008-01-02T16:22:00.000Z	Sonja		i will do what you recommended, but it takes a lot of time to back every thing up
2008-01-02T16:23:00.000Z	Sonja		i still got the segfault in safemode
2008-01-02T16:24:00.000Z	GNU\colossus	Sonja	seemingly unmotivated segfaults are an indicator of a possible hardware defect or (severe) misconfiguration
2008-01-02T16:25:00.000Z	Sonja	GNU\colossus	well it's because i uninstalled firefox. according to ikonia that's what was causes the segfaults
2008-01-02T16:25:00.000Z	GNU\colossus	Sonja	you're on ubuntu 7.10, right?
2008-01-02T16:27:00.000Z	Sonja	GNU\colossus	 ok i'll install kazehazase
2008-01-02T16:28:00.000Z	Sonja	GNU\colossus	 ok installed, what now?
2008-01-02T16:28:00.000Z	GNU\colossus	Sonja	try starting it.
2008-01-02T16:29:00.000Z	GNU\colossus	Sonja	that's great. have fun browsing :)
