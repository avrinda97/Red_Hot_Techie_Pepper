2010-05-10T07:15:00.000Z	brax		Hey, how would I make the windows equivalent of a file sharing server thing?
2010-05-10T07:15:00.000Z	brax		Like where I can have a shared folder on my network that my laptop can access?
2010-05-10T07:16:00.000Z	mikelifeguard	brax	ask in ##windows about windows stuff? :)
2010-05-10T07:16:00.000Z	brax	mikelifeguard	No, I wanted the windows equivalent of a server on _ubuntu_.
2010-05-10T07:17:00.000Z	mikelifeguard	brax	well, some of them do. I did
2010-05-10T07:17:00.000Z	mikelifeguard	brax	Samba is the typical answer. I've never used samba, so I can't help you with specifics.
2010-05-10T07:19:00.000Z	mikelifeguard	brax	Yes, SSH allows you to securely access a computer's CLI remotely.
2010-05-10T07:20:00.000Z	mikelifeguard	brax	You need to create an SSH key on the client computer. It has 2 halves - the public half goes in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on the remote computer (you'll need some kind of pre-existing access to do that, or ask the owner of the computer). Then just run `ssh 192.168.0.x` (or any IP/hostname) to login.
2010-05-10T07:21:00.000Z	mikelifeguard	brax	The remote computer (server) must have sshd running and properly configured for you to gain access. There are plenty of excellent tutorials on both server- and client-side configuration out there.
2010-05-10T07:45:00.000Z	mikelifeguard	brax	Need help with something more?
2010-05-10T07:45:00.000Z	brax	mikelifeguard	Well, now I do, unfortunately.
2010-05-10T07:46:00.000Z	mikelifeguard	brax	I'm not quite sure what you mean... you can't get the desktop to connect to your wireless network?
2010-05-10T07:59:00.000Z	mikelifeguard	brax	you disappeared :P
2010-05-10T07:59:00.000Z	brax	mikelifeguard	Whu?
2010-05-10T07:59:00.000Z	mikelifeguard	brax	you were having some wifi problem, weren't you? Did you fix it?
2010-05-10T08:00:00.000Z	brax	mikelifeguard	Nope. I think since the laptop is booting off of a live usb and the proper drivers aren't installed, the wifi isn't appearing.
2010-05-10T08:01:00.000Z	mikelifeguard	brax	Entirely possible. You can install the drivers to get wifi on the laptop working though... it wouldn't be permanent though. But why are you using a LiveUSB instead of installing it? O.o
2010-05-10T08:02:00.000Z	brax	mikelifeguard	My laptop absolutely detests anything but that-which-shall-remain-unnamed.
