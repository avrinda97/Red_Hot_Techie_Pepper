2008-12-29T03:46:00.000Z	arj1		i use the desktop-i386-install-cd
2008-12-29T03:46:00.000Z	arj1		when i select install, it works until i get to the partition manager. it does not show up!
2008-12-29T03:46:00.000Z	arj1		when i start gparted direclty, the same problem occurs. it is locking for partitions infinitely
2008-12-29T03:46:00.000Z	arj1		mounting the only existing fat32 partition, manually, works
2008-12-29T03:46:00.000Z	arj1		have you got any ideas?
2008-12-29T03:47:00.000Z	arj1		i have some strange problem when installing ubuntu 8.10 on my acer travelmate 8100

2008-12-29T03:47:00.000Z	Flannel	arj1	the ISO actually says install CD?  What version of Ubuntu is this, do you know?
2008-12-29T03:48:00.000Z	arj1	Flannel	its iso titel was ubuntu-8.10-i386.iso when i remember correctly
2008-12-29T03:49:00.000Z	Flannel	arj1	Alright. That's fine.  It just wouldn't say -install- it'd say -desktop- but good, good.  You may try the alternate CD instead of the desktop CD
2008-12-29T03:50:00.000Z	arj1	Flannel	thought so, but is there any possibility to run it with this desktop cd as i don't want to burn another cd ... :/
2008-12-29T03:50:00.000Z	Flannel	arj1	You'd have to figure out why the partitioners aren't working.  It could be possible, yeah.
2008-12-29T03:54:00.000Z	arj1	Flannel	any ideas where to look? i tried the logs, the last thing which was entered there was "ubuntu ubiquity[7110]: log-output -t ubiquity laptop-detect"
2008-12-29T03:55:00.000Z	Flannel	arj1	Try starting them from the command line, (gparted, that is) and see what errors, if any, it throws.
2008-12-29T03:57:00.000Z	arj1	Flannel	thank you for your help. it finally worked (after the partition manager crawled the hard disk for 30 minutes ...)
