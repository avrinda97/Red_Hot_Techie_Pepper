2008-09-12T11:57:00.000Z	[dksuiko]		I know it runs bash, but as for the terminal itself.. for example, in xwindows, you have rxvt, etc.
2008-09-12T11:58:00.000Z	[dksuiko]		deb: ah, good idea.
2008-09-12T11:58:00.000Z	[dksuiko]		don't have a linux box on my at the moment though, chatting from a windows client. :(
2008-09-12T12:00:00.000Z	ykphuah	[dksuiko]	I think the program that prompts you for password is called "login", the program that handles alt-f1 -> alt-f7 is getty
2008-09-12T12:01:00.000Z	[dksuiko]	ykphuah	ah, i see! thanks! i'll google 'getty'
2008-09-12T12:01:00.000Z	ykphuah		I think droopsta915 is talking about the IDE cables.
2008-09-12T12:01:00.000Z	ykphuah	[dksuiko]	you do realize that both of them are not "terminals". :P
2008-09-12T12:02:00.000Z	[dksuiko]		ah, i just wasn't sure what to call it. heh
2008-09-12T12:02:00.000Z	ykphuah	[dksuiko]	last time there was mgetty, then agetty, I don' t know which one we are using now.
2008-09-12T12:02:00.000Z	[dksuiko]	ykphuah	so what would be controlling the video i/o for the terminal?
2008-09-12T12:03:00.000Z	ykphuah	[dksuiko]	maybe I can help more if you tell me what you are trying to acomplish?
2008-09-12T12:03:00.000Z	[dksuiko]	ykphuah	well, not really trying to accomplish anything really, lol. just curious.
2008-09-12T12:03:00.000Z	[dksuiko]		like when you hit alt-f1 to alt-f7, what are those instances of?
2008-09-12T12:04:00.000Z	[dksuiko]		i know rxvt, you can have 7 windows, etc.
2008-09-12T12:04:00.000Z	ykphuah	[dksuiko]	ah ok, getty is the one that handles the alt-f1 -> alt-f7, getty launches the "login" program.
2008-09-12T12:04:00.000Z	ykphuah	[dksuiko]	which ask for your username/password.
2008-09-12T12:05:00.000Z	ykphuah	[dksuiko]	you can look into /etc/inittab, there should be some getty stuffs in there.
