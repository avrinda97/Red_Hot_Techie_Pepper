2007-04-03T05:11:00.000Z	V-DUB	jrib	I can't run gnome-panel, whenever I do it says: I've detected a panel already running and will now exit, or something.
2007-04-03T05:12:00.000Z	jrib	V-DUB	why are you trying to run it?
2007-04-03T05:12:00.000Z	V-DUB	jrib	I have no panel applications running.
2007-04-03T05:13:00.000Z	V-DUB	jrib	I logged in and it gave me the error message.
2007-04-03T05:13:00.000Z	jrib	V-DUB	do you see a panel right now?
2007-04-03T05:13:00.000Z	V-DUB	jrib	No.
2007-04-03T05:13:00.000Z	jrib	V-DUB	ps -ef | grep gnome-panel
2007-04-03T05:13:00.000Z	V-DUB	jrib	Can you break that down and explain? Just for future reference?
2007-04-03T05:14:00.000Z	jrib	V-DUB	ps lists processes, and then you pipe with | to grep to search for the word "gnome-panel"

2007-04-03T05:15:00.000Z	jrib	V-DUB	does this happen everytime or is this the first?
2007-04-03T05:15:00.000Z	V-DUB	jrib	This is the first.
2007-04-03T05:15:00.000Z	V-DUB	jrib	Edgy, in case you were wondering.
2007-04-03T05:16:00.000Z	jrib	V-DUB	killall gnome-panel
2007-04-03T05:16:00.000Z	V-DUB	jrib	Thanks.
2007-04-03T05:16:00.000Z	V-DUB	jrib	I remember you taught me that trick this past summer. I just forgot about it. :P
2007-04-03T05:17:00.000Z	V-DUB	jrib	Thanks.
