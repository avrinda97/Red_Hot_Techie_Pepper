2007-01-02T14:30:00.000Z	theflyingfool		hey my class is trying to get ubuntu running on a bunch pentum 2s any advise
2007-01-02T14:31:00.000Z	Flannel	theflyingfool	get the alternate CD, do a "server" install from the alternate CD, then work up a GUI from there (fluxbox, blackbox, whatever)
2007-01-02T14:32:00.000Z	Flannel	theflyingfool	yes, it'll be a normall ubuntu system, just with only a command line, at first
2007-01-02T14:33:00.000Z	Flannel	theflyingfool	the first link there has a link to a grub CD (scroll all te way down)
2007-01-04T07:44:00.000Z	Flannel	theflyingfool	not Thuggernaut.
2007-01-08T16:48:00.000Z	Flannel	theflyingfool	your home partition will be where you put all your stuff
2007-01-08T16:49:00.000Z	Flannel	theflyingfool	is it going to be the only OS on there?
2007-01-08T16:50:00.000Z	Flannel	theflyingfool	give /home the rest of the space from your other partitions
2007-01-09T11:55:00.000Z	Flannel	theflyingfool	does it work anywhere?  like grub? or anything?
2007-01-09T11:56:00.000Z	Flannel	theflyingfool	right, but does it only not work in a GUI? what we're trying to figure out is if it's software or hardware.  Will it work editing a grub entry (within grub, hit escape, hit e type space, etc).  If not, then I imagine it's hardware.  Take apart your keyboard, clean it, etc etc
2007-01-09T11:58:00.000Z	Flannel	theflyingfool	ctrl-alt-f1 will get you a real terminal, ctrl-alt-f7 gets you back to the GUI.  but that still might have the same issues, as youre going through linux
2007-01-09T11:58:00.000Z	Flannel	theflyingfool	the same software issues, that is.
2007-01-09T12:00:00.000Z	Flannel	theflyingfool	alright, well, at least now you know its a software thing, and X>=  as for fixing it, I... have no idea.
2007-01-25T15:17:00.000Z	Flannel	theflyingfool	regular reasons to use a 64bit OS
2007-01-25T15:17:00.000Z	theflyingfool	Flannel	which would be?
2007-01-25T15:19:00.000Z	Flannel	theflyingfool	um, well, some of them would include ability to use more than 4GB RAM
2007-01-25T15:20:00.000Z	theflyingfool	Flannel	you can only use 4GB of ram on the standard version of ubuntu?
2007-01-25T15:20:00.000Z	Flannel	theflyingfool	4GB of ram is a limitation of 32bit processors, on any OS
