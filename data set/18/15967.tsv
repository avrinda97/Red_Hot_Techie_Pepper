2005-02-07T07:41:00.000Z	tritium		hmm, how can I erase a CD-RW?  nautilus no longer can...
2005-02-07T07:41:00.000Z	thenuke	tritium	k3b?
2005-02-07T07:42:00.000Z	tritium	thenuke	yeah, if I wanted that installed
2005-02-19T11:54:00.000Z	tritium	thenuke	don't dist-upgrade.  It can remove packages when not all dependencies can be met.  (e.g., at this instant, dist-upgrade might remove evolution and ubuntu-desktop)
2005-03-05T07:15:00.000Z	tritium	thenuke	it's safer
2005-03-05T07:15:00.000Z	thenuke	tritium	ah
2005-03-05T07:16:00.000Z	tritium	thenuke	I only use dist-upgrade when something gets held back in an upgrade
2005-03-05T07:16:00.000Z	tritium	thenuke	and even then, I watch what it's going to install and remove
2005-03-05T07:16:00.000Z	tritium	thenuke	and I don't always allow it to happe
2005-03-05T07:17:00.000Z	thenuke	tritium	with upgrade I wont now get k3b and abiword upgraded for example, I dont really understand why they would not be upgraded?
2005-03-05T07:18:00.000Z	tritium	thenuke	they're held back for various reasons
2005-03-05T07:18:00.000Z	tritium	thenuke	try "apt-get -u dist-upgrade" to see what a dist-upgrade might do
2005-03-05T07:19:00.000Z	thenuke	tritium	with -u I get the very same output
2005-03-05T07:20:00.000Z	tritium	thenuke	it should tell you what packages will be upgrade, etc.
2005-03-05T07:20:00.000Z	thenuke	tritium	oh, I see that without -u too
2005-03-05T07:20:00.000Z	tritium	thenuke	so, what's it going to do
2005-03-05T07:34:00.000Z	tritium	thenuke	so what does the dist-upgrade want to do?
2005-06-28T16:57:00.000Z	tritium	thenuke	"apt-cache rdepends gdm"
