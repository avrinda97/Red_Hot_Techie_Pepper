2010-02-05T17:09:00.000Z	suman		if it is giving me an error at the time  of booting
2010-02-05T17:09:00.000Z	airtonix	suman	what is meant by sap ?
2010-02-05T17:10:00.000Z	suman	airtonix	srry that is sap
2010-02-05T17:10:00.000Z	suman		swap
2010-02-05T17:10:00.000Z	airtonix	suman	ahh it makes sense now
2010-02-05T17:11:00.000Z	suman	airtonix	srry that is swap
2010-02-05T17:11:00.000Z	airtonix	suman	first thing i would try is to reformat it using gparted while using a livecd
2010-02-05T17:12:00.000Z	airtonix	suman	so that is 1) reboot machine with livecd isnerted 2) load gparted from menu 3) select swap partition on the machine 4) format it as a swap drive.
2010-02-05T17:12:00.000Z	airtonix	suman	however that is only my first guess
2010-02-05T17:13:00.000Z	suman	airtonix	 reformatting will erase the current installation
2010-02-05T17:13:00.000Z	airtonix	suman	no it wont read exactly what i said.
