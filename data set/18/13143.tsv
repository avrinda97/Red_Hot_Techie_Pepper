2009-10-09T20:24:00.000Z	DaveMustaine		--> bazhang <-- I know dude, but the problem is the device
2009-10-09T20:24:00.000Z	DaveMustaine		I dunno which device is that

2009-10-09T20:26:00.000Z	IdleOne	DaveMustaine	the port you use does not make a difference
2009-10-09T20:28:00.000Z	IdleOne	DaveMustaine	ok now you need to reboot your computer and before it starts to boot up the OS you need to hit the escape key ( could be delete or another ) and go into the bios, change the order of boot sequence and make the USB first. if you don't see USB your computer may not be able to boot from usb
2009-10-09T20:37:00.000Z	IdleOne	DaveMustaine	come back here and point your finger at us with a mean look on your face
2009-10-09T20:38:00.000Z	IdleOne	DaveMustaine	try usb fdc like bazhang said
2009-10-09T20:41:00.000Z	IdleOne	DaveMustaine	ok well now you have to make sure you properly installed ubuntu the to usb stick
2009-10-10T00:27:00.000Z	IdleOne	DaveMustaine	you can put those packages on a usb stick then copy them over to the other computer and install but you would also need to download all the dependencies
2009-10-10T00:29:00.000Z	IdleOne	DaveMustaine	download the depends same way you did the other packages. packages.ubuntu.com is a good place to look
2009-10-10T00:32:00.000Z	IdleOne	DaveMustaine	lol
