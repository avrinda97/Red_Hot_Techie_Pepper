2005-07-04T16:57:00.000Z	oofnik		haha sara_poo you can just do sudo passwd root to create a root password and use the root account
2005-07-04T16:57:00.000Z	oofnik		haha, alright whatever works :-P
2005-07-04T16:57:00.000Z	oofnik		hey, when you're bored, guessing root passwords randomly can be fun...
2005-07-04T16:58:00.000Z	oofnik		yup
2005-07-04T16:58:00.000Z	oofnik		haha good job
2005-07-04T16:59:00.000Z	oofnik		i like how you think, dooglus
2005-07-04T05:00:00.000Z	oofnik		hah
2005-07-04T05:00:00.000Z	oofnik		yeah he needs the O2 for breathing not fire..
2005-07-04T05:01:00.000Z	oofnik		why doe ubuntu come with /etc/fstab and /etc/mtab? what's the diff between the two?
2005-07-04T05:01:00.000Z	oofnik		ah i see
2005-07-04T05:01:00.000Z	dooglus_	oofnik	/etc/mtab is "what is mounted" and /etc/fstab is "what do I know how to mount"
2005-07-04T05:02:00.000Z	dooglus_	oofnik	/etc/fstab stays the same size as you umount stuff, whereas /etc/mtab gets smaller
2005-07-04T05:02:00.000Z	dooglus_	oofnik	you shouldn't edit it
2005-07-04T05:03:00.000Z	oofnik	dooglus_	what is used to automount my USB external?
2005-07-04T05:03:00.000Z	dooglus_	oofnik	I don't know.  it's magic.  it just works (for about 10 minutes, after which it just crashes) for me
2005-07-04T05:07:00.000Z	oofnik	dooglus_	does pkill do the same as killall
2005-07-04T05:12:00.000Z	dooglus_	oofnik	it's laggy for me, and it also seems to cause gnome to hang on startup most of the time (in breezy)
2005-07-04T05:13:00.000Z	dooglus_	oofnik	if I use esd, pausing a music track takes a noticeable time, as does restarting playback.  with alsa it's instantanous
