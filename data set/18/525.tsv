2012-01-18T11:46:00.000Z	codepython777		these are the last lines before the new boot
2012-01-18T11:48:00.000Z	codepython777		no, but its a VPS, so it could be the ones who run the VMs?
2012-01-18T11:49:00.000Z	codepython777		why did xen try to start?
2012-01-18T11:49:00.000Z	codepython777		dpkg -l | grep xen -- null on my machine
2012-01-18T11:51:00.000Z	codepython777		ah its the xen ethernet driver ? that i do have
2012-01-18T11:52:00.000Z	codepython777		yes i think so
2012-01-18T11:54:00.000Z	codepython777		is there a nice gui tool that emails me when one of my machines is down?
2012-01-18T11:55:00.000Z	orlok	codepython777	most are not gui as they run on servers somewhere
2012-01-18T11:55:00.000Z	codepython777	orlok	any recommendations?
2012-01-18T11:56:00.000Z	orlok	codepython777	oh, for Xen specifically? Not sure.. i would use a simple shell script, but theres things like nagios, etc
2012-01-18T11:56:00.000Z	orlok	codepython777	a GUI tool, so it requires X to be running?
2012-01-18T11:57:00.000Z	orlok	codepython777	But will you if theres an issue that causes your Xen instances to fail?
2012-01-18T11:57:00.000Z	codepython777	orlok	Its not my xen...I got a VPS rented from someone who runs xen...I just need to monitor my VM
2012-01-18T11:57:00.000Z	orlok	codepython777	you would need X to start up and start this application automatically..
2012-01-18T11:58:00.000Z	orlok	codepython777	and get it to send an email on boot!
2012-01-18T11:58:00.000Z	codepython777	orlok	thats easy :) -- get to send me an email, when its dead actually :)
2012-01-18T11:58:00.000Z	orlok	codepython777	"Ahh crap i rebooted! i fell down and i dont know where i am!"
2012-01-18T11:59:00.000Z	codepython777	orlok	nah -- "I am dead master...here are the last 100 lines of my /var/log/messages -- please switch me back on " :)
