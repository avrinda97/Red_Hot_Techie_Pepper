2009-09-26T04:37:00.000Z	qw30_		so I have to get my leprechaun to do some crazy magic for me
2009-09-26T04:38:00.000Z	qw30_		Ubuntu should read /etc/fstab like any proper operating system would
2009-09-26T04:39:00.000Z	BlackFate	qw30_	you mean the uuid thing?
2009-09-26T04:39:00.000Z	BlackFate	qw30_	have you ever used uuids?
2009-09-26T04:41:00.000Z	BlackFate	qw30_	youll propably know when you have sata disks dont have a fixed letter in /dev/sdX
2009-09-26T04:41:00.000Z	BlackFate	qw30_	does the job quite well
2009-09-26T04:42:00.000Z	BlackFate	qw30_	ppl who complain about UUID really dont undestand the potential
2009-09-26T04:42:00.000Z	BlackFate	qw30_	of uuids
2009-09-26T04:43:00.000Z	BlackFate	qw30_	than cant happen.. every uuid is unique
2009-09-26T04:45:00.000Z	BlackFate	qw30_	uuids change only when you format partition or resize etc
