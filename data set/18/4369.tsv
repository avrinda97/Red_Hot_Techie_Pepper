2009-08-15T17:33:00.000Z	ikanobori	cutout	'Problems connecting to vpn' is a bad description of the problem.
2009-08-15T17:34:00.000Z	cutout	ikanobori	will I installed pptp and configured it but it refuse to connect it says connection failed
2009-08-15T17:35:00.000Z	ikanobori	cutout	That can mean anything from a wide range of problems. Including wrong username/password.
2009-08-15T17:36:00.000Z	cutout	ikanobori	the ip/username/password are good I connected from xp machine
2009-08-15T17:36:00.000Z	ikanobori	cutout	That says nothing about you typing them in correctly again, but let's assume you did ;-)
2009-08-15T17:37:00.000Z	cutout	ikanobori	eill Idid
2009-08-15T17:37:00.000Z	ikanobori	cutout	Are the encryption settings allright?
2009-08-15T17:37:00.000Z	cutout	ikanobori	what kind of encryption should I use
2009-08-15T17:37:00.000Z	ikanobori	cutout	Depends on the VPN you are connecting to.
2009-08-15T17:37:00.000Z	cutout	ikanobori	in windows nothing is specified
2009-08-15T17:38:00.000Z	ikanobori	cutout	Are you connecting to a windows vpn?
2009-08-15T17:38:00.000Z	cutout	ikanobori	yes
2009-08-15T17:39:00.000Z	ikanobori	cutout	And you have set the correct $SERVER, $DOMAIN? Have you tried with and without encryption?
2009-08-15T17:40:00.000Z	cutout	ikanobori	what domain but I'll try with and without encryption now
2009-08-15T17:40:00.000Z	ikanobori	cutout	The network domain the VPN uses.
2009-08-15T17:40:00.000Z	cutout	ikanobori	is it an IP
2009-08-15T17:41:00.000Z	ikanobori	cutout	Let me put it this way, PPTP tunneling (VPN), works, if your settings are correct.
