2009-03-11T19:59:00.000Z	mohanohi		as reading about fstab, its actually is for partition of drives on booting configuration files right? But i am talking about pen drive here..
2009-03-11T19:59:00.000Z	usr13	mohanohi	fstab is for mounting drives
2009-03-11T20:00:00.000Z	usr13	mohanohi	It tells the operating system what you want mounted or what you want the user to have access to, in being able to mount.
2009-03-11T20:01:00.000Z	usr13	mohanohi	What are you trying to do?
2009-03-11T20:02:00.000Z	usr13	mohanohi	Oh, ok.
2009-03-11T20:04:00.000Z	usr13	mohanohi	you may need to edit /etc/goup and see that  your user name is entered on the line that starts with the word disk  and also the one that starts with plugdvd  But first, let me ask;  Are you the original user that was established on this system?
2009-03-11T20:05:00.000Z	usr13	mohanohi	Have you added a new user to the system?
2009-03-11T20:08:00.000Z	usr13	mohanohi	If you just edit the file /etc/group and add a comma and your new user name to the end of each line that contains the original user name.
2009-03-11T20:09:00.000Z	usr13	mohanohi	And after that, just log out and back in again.
