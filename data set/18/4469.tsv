2009-04-06T18:56:00.000Z	jamalfanaian		How can I restart the network inside the shell provided by the Ubuntu command-line installer?
2009-04-06T18:56:00.000Z	jamalfanaian		There is no /etc/init.d/networking or ifdown ::\
2009-04-06T18:57:00.000Z	jamalfanaian		And there is no ifconfig either
2009-04-06T18:58:00.000Z	dschulz	jamalfanaian	but there's dhclient, right?
2009-04-06T18:59:00.000Z	jamalfanaian	dschulz	I just found it
2009-04-06T18:59:00.000Z	jamalfanaian		I'm getting an IP address, and I can ping my gateway and other computers within the network... but I can't ping anything in the net... say google.com
2009-04-06T18:59:00.000Z	jamalfanaian		Or even it's IP address
2009-04-06T19:00:00.000Z	dschulz	jamalfanaian	 maybe you don't have a gateway configured
2009-04-06T19:00:00.000Z	jamalfanaian	dschulz	I added it to /etc/network/interfaces but I couldn't figure out how to restart the interface so the changes take effect
2009-04-06T19:02:00.000Z	dschulz	jamalfanaian	are you running from livecd?  are you sure your networking isn't managed by networkmanager?
2009-04-06T19:03:00.000Z	jamalfanaian	dschulz	neither, i'm installing via tftp so i'm running the command-line installer... it's trying to get to us.archive.ubuntu.com to get packages but it can't connect to it... dhcp is working
2009-04-06T19:04:00.000Z	dschulz	jamalfanaian	weird.. but dhcp lease should provide a gateway address anyway
2009-04-06T19:05:00.000Z	dschulz	jamalfanaian	maybe your dhcp server is not configured properly
2009-04-06T19:05:00.000Z	jamalfanaian	dschulz	yeah i'll keep playing wiht it, it's providing the wrong address which is the issue
2009-04-06T19:05:00.000Z	jamalfanaian		thanks for the help so far :)
2009-04-06T19:05:00.000Z	jamalfanaian		the dhcp server is fine,.. the laptop thinks my desktop is a gateway though
2009-04-06T19:07:00.000Z	jamalfanaian	dschulz	Ahh I got it to work :) I guess it was caching my desktop's ip address because it originally got it's ip from there. I was running a DHCP server to get it to load a TFTP install... but it wasn't switching to my router's dhcp correctly. manually deleting the route and adding the right gateway worked. Thx for suggesting that! :)
