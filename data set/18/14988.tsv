2005-07-02T07:41:00.000Z	nalioth	NigelS	they are not available now
2005-07-02T07:41:00.000Z	nalioth	NigelS	i cannot use win32 codecs
2005-07-02T07:43:00.000Z	nalioth	NigelS	there aer some that dont work on ppc arch
2005-07-02T07:44:00.000Z	NigelS	nalioth	ah I see, I guess not many will be running desktops with PPC into the future though I guess :)
2005-07-02T07:45:00.000Z	nalioth	NigelS	that is a good point (although i've been thinking about a small 8xPower IBM box)
2005-07-02T07:47:00.000Z	NigelS	nalioth	yeah, I'm sure it's pretty cool - I guess PPC will still be around for a while - will become collectors items on ebay even for PPC mac things I suspect.  Jobs reckons *they* can transition in 2 years but the customers will take longer :)
2005-07-02T07:48:00.000Z	nalioth	NigelS	this one i'm using now (via ubuntu) is over 3.5 years old (from time i opened the box) and (besides a HD replacement) is still goin quit well
2005-07-02T07:49:00.000Z	NigelS	nalioth	cool, I was tempted to buy a PB a while back, I love their design but then I realised that I'm a student and have no money :)
2005-07-02T07:50:00.000Z	nalioth	NigelS	the macs are well built (that i've owned) and last a good long time (from experience)
2005-07-02T07:50:00.000Z	nalioth	NigelS	i've owned 3 intel notebooks in the 3.5+ years i've had this one, and they all felt/were cheap
2005-07-02T07:51:00.000Z	NigelS	nalioth	yeah, this is my parent's one that Ive borrowed while I'm at home and the keyboard and construction is quite cheap and nasty :)
2005-07-02T07:51:00.000Z	nalioth	NigelS	faster pbs will ALWAYS be around the corner
2005-07-02T07:52:00.000Z	NigelS	nalioth	we're not talking brushed aluminium look here :)
2005-07-02T07:52:00.000Z	nalioth	NigelS	the busted-plastic-aluminum-look?
2005-07-02T07:54:00.000Z	NigelS	nalioth	it's the chinese toy factory spare plastic parts look on this fujitsu siemens one
2005-07-02T07:54:00.000Z	nalioth	NigelS	i don't care to discuss chinese x86 cheapness. i bought several and ran linux on em (til they crapped out)
2005-07-02T07:56:00.000Z	nalioth	NigelS	yes, just tick the box
2005-07-02T07:56:00.000Z	nalioth	NigelS	apple (via next) has a history of 'fat binarys'
