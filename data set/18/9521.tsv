2007-03-31T10:32:00.000Z	Chesney		Quick question whats the best way to find a devices PCI ID?
2007-03-31T10:32:00.000Z	ant-	Chesney	: lspci
2007-03-31T10:33:00.000Z	ant-	Chesney	: use lspci
2007-03-31T10:33:00.000Z	ant-	Chesney	: just type 'lspci'
2007-03-31T10:34:00.000Z	Chesney	ant-	 Sorry, I just realized i'm not being clear enough. Its not actually a PCI device is the VGA slot on the motherboard. So when I did lspci about an hour ago I didn't get what I was going for.
2007-03-31T10:35:00.000Z	Chesney	ant-	Its late....agp
2007-03-31T10:36:00.000Z	ant-	Chesney	: then goto device manager
2007-03-31T10:37:00.000Z	Chesney	ant-	Yup, I just realized that. I'm still getting over there being a decent GUI system component on a Linux Disto.

2007-03-31T13:02:00.000Z	Chesney	ant-	does ubuntu differentiate between SATA drives by changing the /dev/sda? I know some distros symlink their stuff so its always hda
2007-03-31T13:03:00.000Z	ant-	Chesney	: mine are labeled sda so i assume no symlink
2007-03-31T13:13:00.000Z	ant-	Chesney	: he would need atleast 2, / and swap
2007-03-31T13:14:00.000Z	Chesney	ant-	you can do it without it, well with at least a swap the rest can go on one partiton
2007-03-31T13:15:00.000Z	ant-	Chesney	: i dont think ubuntu will let you install with out atleast a / "root" and a swap partition
2007-03-31T13:16:00.000Z	Chesney	ant-	thats what I was saying, you don't have to have one for /root /boot and swap though
2007-03-31T13:18:00.000Z	ant-	Chesney	: what is his problem?
2007-03-31T13:19:00.000Z	Chesney	ant-	Lucifel, from what I gathered things just keep crashing right?
2007-03-31T13:20:00.000Z	ant-	Chesney	: there is a Lucifel and a lucifiel
