2008-11-12T01:45:00.000Z	Hideme		any idea why I get a duplicate eth2 with default settings after I reboot?
2008-11-12T01:46:00.000Z	lavacano201014	Hideme	You have TWO eth2's?
2008-11-12T01:46:00.000Z	Hideme	lavacano201014	 Nope... eth0, eth1 and eth2.  a second eth2 is picked up on boot each time and I need to delete it.
2008-11-12T01:47:00.000Z	lavacano201014	Hideme	Maybe it's some internal hardware that Ubuntu is getting confused about
2008-11-12T01:47:00.000Z	lavacano201014	Hideme	Or maybe it goes "wireless, wired ethernet, modem"?
2008-11-12T01:47:00.000Z	Hideme	lavacano201014	 No idea.... thus my presence here.  :)
2008-11-12T01:49:00.000Z	lavacano201014	Hideme	"ls /dev | grep eth | less" and pastebin the results.
2008-11-12T01:50:00.000Z	Hideme	lavacano201014	 Mmmm nothing.
2008-11-12T01:50:00.000Z	lavacano201014	Hideme	So, when it tries to list the contents of /dev, no eth devices appear...
2008-11-12T01:50:00.000Z	lavacano201014	Hideme	Either something's VERY wrong or it wants root access...try with sudo
2008-11-12T01:51:00.000Z	Hideme	lavacano201014	  I did... same result.
2008-11-12T01:51:00.000Z	lavacano201014	Hideme	That's really oddd
2008-11-12T01:52:00.000Z	Hideme	lavacano201014	 One thing to note is I did an upgrade from 8.04 to 8.10.  A few others were complaining of this duplicate interface issue too.
2008-11-12T01:52:00.000Z	lavacano201014	Hideme	Ah. I should probably check to see if it happened to me
2008-11-12T01:53:00.000Z	Hideme	lavacano201014	  I'm in /dev , see nothing related to ethX.
2008-11-12T01:53:00.000Z	lavacano201014	Hideme	Hmm, Batman.
2008-11-12T01:56:00.000Z	Hideme	lavacano201014	 I think so...   see what you get with an ifconfig
2008-11-12T01:57:00.000Z	lavacano201014	Hideme	Yep, eth0 is showing up fine
