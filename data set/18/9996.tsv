2007-01-29T11:14:00.000Z	slyfox		Please help. I have a sound problem. Video and mp3 and general sound work fine, but when it comes to skype or Gizmo, the sound has problems. Whenever I make a call, the sound is like when you have 100% cpu usage and are playing an mp3 file, it has this buzzing noise. Like: "He l  l l l l oooo, Wel l  l l coooo me to Sk   y y yy  pppeee tteeesst caaall"  Same happens in Gizmo. I trid both - ALSA and OSS (no idea what
2007-01-29T11:14:00.000Z	slyfox		they mean though, I am a noob) and both have the same problem. When I look at the cpu usage when making a call, both programs are not using full cpu, they use very little - the normal usage. The sound is still choppy. What is going on?
2007-01-29T11:15:00.000Z	variant	slyfox	skype is bs quite frankly.. but your best bet is to ask on skype forums
2007-01-29T11:16:00.000Z	slyfox	variant	and same with Gizmo?

2007-04-18T07:09:00.000Z	variant	slyfox	how do you do it in windows then?
2007-04-18T07:10:00.000Z	slyfox	variant	go to disk management, right click on the disk you need and do change label
2007-04-18T07:35:00.000Z	variant	slyfox	it won't conflict
2007-04-18T07:35:00.000Z	variant	slyfox	you can write udev rules to define where to mount the partition.. you can then call it whatever you like. little complicated though
2007-04-18T07:43:00.000Z	variant	slyfox	yes
2007-04-18T07:43:00.000Z	variant	slyfox	thats where the filesystem will put information from bad fsck's
2007-04-21T12:05:00.000Z	variant	slyfox	there is no extension.. it can be anything
2007-04-21T12:06:00.000Z	variant	slyfox	unix decides what a file is by content, not extension
2007-04-21T12:07:00.000Z	variant	slyfox	good question, you can combine ls, file and rm into one command that would do it
2007-04-21T12:07:00.000Z	variant	slyfox	and grep
2007-04-21T12:07:00.000Z	slyfox	variant	my head is spinning
2007-04-21T12:07:00.000Z	variant	slyfox	there are a bunch of ways to do it
