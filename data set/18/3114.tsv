2009-12-22T07:43:00.000Z	gehzumteufel		Okay anyone here know xterm scripting??
2009-12-22T07:44:00.000Z	gehzumteufel		xterm environment scripting
2009-12-22T07:44:00.000Z	leprechau	gehzumteufel	you mean bash scripting?
2009-12-22T07:45:00.000Z	gehzumteufel	leprechau	No, this would be xterm shell scripting that I am referring to
2009-12-22T07:45:00.000Z	leprechau	gehzumteufel	xterm is just another terminal app .... it's not a shell
2009-12-22T07:47:00.000Z	leprechau	gehzumteufel	that's easy to do...just setup your login profile(s) on the servers you are connecting to
2009-12-22T07:47:00.000Z	leprechau	gehzumteufel	also check out: http://sshmenu.sourceforge.net/
2009-12-22T07:47:00.000Z	gehzumteufel	leprechau	well I was trying to avoid that, so that I don't have to do it on every server. There are 40 of them.
2009-12-22T07:48:00.000Z	leprechau	gehzumteufel	well your servers should have proper names to begin with..it's pretty bad practice to give your servers non-descript names
2009-12-22T07:49:00.000Z	leprechau	gehzumteufel	no you don't ... konsole will do it if you just pass the option to konsole when you start it
2009-12-22T07:49:00.000Z	leprechau	gehzumteufel	setup some 'book marks' that start konsole and set the title
2009-12-22T07:50:00.000Z	leprechau	gehzumteufel	but that's still nasty ... set your freaking profiles
2009-12-22T07:50:00.000Z	gehzumteufel	leprechau	the profiles would still need changing with every tab
2009-12-22T07:50:00.000Z	leprechau	gehzumteufel	you are trying to do something locally that should be done on the server side
2009-12-22T07:52:00.000Z	leprechau	gehzumteufel	sure... first read here: http://www.mit.edu/afs/athena/system/x11r4/src/mit/clients/xterm/ctlseq2.txt those are all the standard escapes
2009-12-22T07:53:00.000Z	leprechau	gehzumteufel	and in your bashrc or profile stick something like: echo -ne "\033]0;"TheWindowTitleHere"\007"
2009-12-22T07:55:00.000Z	leprechau	gehzumteufel	actually google just gave you a better one than I did: http://www.fvue.nl/wiki/Bash:_How_to_change_tab_and_window_title_of_console
2009-12-22T07:56:00.000Z	gehzumteufel	leprechau	 sick thanks!
