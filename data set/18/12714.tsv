2007-10-22T23:37:00.000Z	lastent		hi, when I put an usb drive and it automounts, is gnome who is doing that? or is it ubuntu?
2007-10-22T23:39:00.000Z	nickrud	lastent	gnome-volume-manager is supposed to be monitoring constantly, just plugging in a drive should trigger the mount event
2007-10-22T23:40:00.000Z	lastent	nickrud	it is not mounting the usb drive
2007-10-22T23:42:00.000Z	nickrud	lastent	check ps -aux , are dbus-daemon , hald , and gnome-volume-manger all running?

2007-10-22T23:50:00.000Z	nickrud	lastent	I don't see hald, which would cause that. Why it quit, I don't know. run ps aux | grep hald to be sure; you can try sudo /etc/init.d/hal restart
2007-10-22T23:50:00.000Z	nickrud	lastent	s/restart/start/
2007-10-22T23:51:00.000Z	lastent	nickrud	roman@roman-desktop:~/Desktop$ ps aux | grep hald
2007-10-22T23:51:00.000Z	nickrud	lastent	don't paste here, and hald isn't in that list, just the addons
2007-10-22T23:53:00.000Z	nickrud	lastent	lapsus brutus?
2007-10-22T23:53:00.000Z	lastent	nickrud	why would hal stop working
2007-10-22T23:53:00.000Z	nickrud	lastent	not a clue.
2007-10-22T23:54:00.000Z	nickrud	lastent	you can see if there's a core file for hald in /var/crash , I don't know how to read it but others do
2007-10-22T23:55:00.000Z	lastent	nickrud	thank you very much
2007-10-22T23:55:00.000Z	nickrud	lastent	that worked then? And what's lapsus brutus ! :)
2007-10-22T23:56:00.000Z	lastent	nickrud	is like saying it was a moment I wasn't thinkig
2007-10-22T23:56:00.000Z	lastent	nickrud	is latin
2007-10-22T23:57:00.000Z	nickrud	lastent	latin for doh, I'm dumb! then
