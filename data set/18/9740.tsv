2007-04-23T13:09:00.000Z	NemesisD	crdlb	Intel Corporation Mobile 915GM/GMS/910GML
2007-04-23T13:10:00.000Z	crdlb	NemesisD	then yes, the only player unaffected by that is mplayer
2007-04-23T13:10:00.000Z	NemesisD		oh but i disagree, totem can't do it either, nor realplay
2007-04-23T13:10:00.000Z	NemesisD		nor vlc
2007-04-23T13:10:00.000Z	NemesisD		it just opens and immediately closes

2007-04-23T13:13:00.000Z	crdlb	NemesisD	oh if the players crash, that's a separate issue that I'm not familiar with

2007-04-23T13:15:00.000Z	NemesisD	crdlb	fatal error: error opening/initializing the selected video_out (-vo) device
2007-04-23T13:15:00.000Z	crdlb	NemesisD	try setting the video out to Xv in mplayer's preferences
2007-04-23T13:17:00.000Z	NemesisD	crdlb	now it doesn't give the error, it just closes immediately like the rest of the video players
2007-04-23T13:17:00.000Z	crdlb	NemesisD	I don't know, it certainly sounds like a bug in your video drivers though
2007-04-23T13:17:00.000Z	NemesisD	crdlb	dag burnit
2007-04-23T13:19:00.000Z	NemesisD		brb ima try changing to my default driver
