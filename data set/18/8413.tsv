2009-01-05T16:34:00.000Z	Guillem		How can I start gnome apps - such as evince- over a ssh -CX connection? Since Intrepid, those apps keep complaining about gconf is not running....
2009-01-05T16:36:00.000Z	Slart	Guillem	hmm.. never had any problems before.. hang on.. let me try it locally here
2009-01-05T16:37:00.000Z	Guillem	Slart	seems about a problem with dbus.
2009-01-05T16:37:00.000Z	Slart	Guillem	I just tried running mousepad, since I run xfce on the remote computer and that worked nicely..
2009-01-05T16:37:00.000Z	Slart	Guillem	might be a gnome thing though..
2009-01-05T16:38:00.000Z	Guillem	Slart	yes, for sure. xfce apps won't complain about gconf
2009-01-05T16:38:00.000Z	Slart	Guillem	as I now see that you wrote in your question =)
2009-01-05T16:39:00.000Z	Slart	Guillem	let me boot up my laptop then.. it has plain ubuntu/gnome on it
2009-01-05T16:39:00.000Z	Guillem	Slart	my concern is that gconf needs to be properly launched with dbus somewhat, since latest gnome release.
2009-01-05T16:39:00.000Z	Guillem	Slart	also may be a problem of Gnome already running in the remote machine. I'll check that right now.
2009-01-05T16:48:00.000Z	Slart	Guillem	it seems to work alright for me.. I get an error "Failed to create dbus proxu for org.gnome.Settings".. but it still works
2009-01-05T16:48:00.000Z	Guillem	Slart	hmm, but in my case works very slow at certain operations like showing a file-browser dialog, etc.
2009-01-05T16:50:00.000Z	Slart	Guillem	well... it isn't very fast.. but it's still usable I think
2009-01-05T16:50:00.000Z	Guillem	Slart	yes, just I wish to find out which is the proper way to do remote use of current gnome apps...
2009-01-05T16:58:00.000Z	Guillem	Slart	strange, I've found out how to start dbus manually and "attach" gconf to it, and now I get the error you shown me.... and works much better. Your laptop is in Intrepid?
2009-01-05T16:58:00.000Z	Slart	Guillem	yes, 32 bit ubuntu 8.10
2009-01-05T16:58:00.000Z	Guillem	Slart	OK
2009-01-05T16:58:00.000Z	Slart	Guillem	you're welcome
