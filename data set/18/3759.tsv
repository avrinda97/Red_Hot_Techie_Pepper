2010-07-12T20:39:00.000Z	rojoloco47		 Hi, I need help with setting up Mail Server over ubuntu 10.04
2010-07-12T20:40:00.000Z	rojoloco47		I have finished trying almost every tutorial for setting up mailserver in ubuntu 10.04 desktop, but I am failed, Can Somebody please help me ?
2010-07-12T20:40:00.000Z	trothigar	rojoloco47	what in particular?
2010-07-12T20:41:00.000Z	trothigar	rojoloco47	http://flurdy.com/docs/postfix/ this was the document I used. but that was for virtual domains etc... perhaps overkill for you?
2010-07-12T20:42:00.000Z	trothigar	rojoloco47	I take it you've looked at the  ubuntu wiki page?
2010-07-12T20:43:00.000Z	trothigar	rojoloco47	unlikely I'll be at my computer, but I will still be on irc
2010-07-12T20:43:00.000Z	trothigar	rojoloco47	what are your needs for the mail server? does it need to deal with multiple domians, virtual users, etc..?
2010-07-12T20:45:00.000Z	trothigar	rojoloco47	then the doc I gave you is overkill
2010-07-12T20:45:00.000Z	rojoloco47	trothigar	Can I have your MSN, or gmail or something like that ? SO that I can contact you easily , I really need it before next 2 hours,
2010-07-12T20:45:00.000Z	trothigar	rojoloco47	all you need is a basic postifix setup with courier on top
2010-07-12T20:48:00.000Z	trothigar	rojoloco47	all you should have modified are the config files right, so I think all you need to do is remove them and then use dpkg-reconfigure to regenerate the default config. You need a basic postifx set up to handle the mail and provide smtp, and then courier for imap.
2010-07-12T20:49:00.000Z	trothigar	rojoloco47	get postfix working first, then concentrate on imap
2010-07-12T20:51:00.000Z	trothigar	rojoloco47	you might have more luck in #ubuntu-server
2010-07-12T20:53:00.000Z	trothigar	rojoloco47	yes ubuntu-server and desktop only differ in the default set of installed packages
2010-07-12T20:53:00.000Z	trothigar	rojoloco47	/join
2010-07-12T20:54:00.000Z	trothigar	rojoloco47	/join #ubuntu-server even
