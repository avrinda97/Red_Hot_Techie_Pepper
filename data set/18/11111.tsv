2007-08-04T05:07:00.000Z	ShackJack	rem	you should put the name of the person you are addressing in IM so they are alerted to your response... Use TAB to autocomplete IM handles...
2007-08-04T05:17:00.000Z	ShackJack	rem	Did you try changing it in gconf2?
2007-08-04T05:18:00.000Z	ShackJack	rem	Should be under system menu (may have to activate) or type gconf-editor
2007-08-04T05:19:00.000Z	ShackJack	rem	And you found the panel settings?
2007-08-04T05:20:00.000Z	ShackJack	rem	How many panels you running?
2007-08-04T05:20:00.000Z	ShackJack	rem	Check other panels in apps/pannel/toplevels/panel_X
2007-08-04T05:22:00.000Z	ShackJack	rem	Dunno - if it says 24 in gconf, it should say 24 in panel properties... It couldn't be otherwise... YOu can delete you .gconf and .gconf2 directories under your home dir (hidden directories) to rebuild your panels anew
2007-08-04T05:23:00.000Z	ShackJack	rem	I dunno it's something else then - can't say what.. That's where the data is...
2007-08-04T05:25:00.000Z	ShackJack	rem	I dunno look againg under gconf and toggle the setting of the appropriate panel, you shold see a change...
2007-08-04T05:26:00.000Z	ShackJack	rem	Just go in gconf like I said and toggle the settings...
