2008-03-20T23:20:00.000Z	rym		I was messing around with xserv-org earlier today cause i had resolution issues
2008-03-20T23:20:00.000Z	rym		but now when i boot ubuntu gnome doesnt load
2008-03-20T23:20:00.000Z	rym		it keeps looping for a while and then it stops the gnome display manager
2008-03-20T23:21:00.000Z	graft	rym	obviously you messed up your xorg settings, why not roll it back to the previous version?
2008-03-20T23:21:00.000Z	rym		how would i do that
2008-03-20T23:21:00.000Z	graft	rym	you did save a backup of your xorg.conf before messing around with it, right?
2008-03-20T23:21:00.000Z	rym		i tried dpkg-reconfigure in recovery mode
2008-03-20T23:21:00.000Z	rym	graft	*cough*
2008-03-20T23:21:00.000Z	graft	rym	*slap* well, dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg SHOULD restore it
2008-03-20T23:22:00.000Z	rym		well it doesnt
2008-03-20T23:22:00.000Z	rym		oh
2008-03-20T23:22:00.000Z	rym		wait
2008-03-20T23:22:00.000Z	rym		i think i typed xserver-org in stead of xserver-xorg
2008-03-20T23:22:00.000Z	rym		sec
2008-03-20T23:22:00.000Z	graft	rym	the lowly typo brings down even the best of men
2008-03-20T23:23:00.000Z	rym	graft	i also added -phigh for automatic configuration
2008-03-20T23:23:00.000Z	rym		that should work, right?
2008-03-20T23:23:00.000Z	graft	rym	no idea
