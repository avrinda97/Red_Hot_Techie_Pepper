2008-04-18T18:42:00.000Z	HSNews		what to download?
2008-04-18T18:42:00.000Z	HSNews		no..
2008-04-18T18:42:00.000Z	bwayne	HSNews	 what sort of sysinfo?  lshw is good for listing hardware.
2008-04-18T18:43:00.000Z	HSNews		CPU usage.. MEM usage and other stuff, eth0 traffic
2008-04-18T18:43:00.000Z	bwayne	HSNews	 i like htop for cpu usage memusage.  doesn't do eth0.
2008-04-18T18:44:00.000Z	bwayne	HSNews	 if you're running an X session, an app named conky can display all that info.
2008-04-18T18:45:00.000Z	HSNews	bwayne	i said "in shell" :) conky the best... i want something alternate
2008-04-18T18:45:00.000Z	HSNews		only for shell
2008-04-18T18:46:00.000Z	bwayne	HSNews	 right.  i don't know of a single program for all that.  most shell tools are a one tool for one job sort of thing.
2008-04-18T18:46:00.000Z	HSNews		õíûê ;'(
2008-04-18T18:46:00.000Z	HSNews		very bad(
2008-04-18T18:47:00.000Z	bwayne	HSNews	 nothing stopping you from running different progs in separate tty's though.  so that htop would be in one tty and other programs in others.
2008-04-18T18:49:00.000Z	HSNews		how to turn ON Swap on disk? In statistycs I see: SWAP 0/1474MB
2008-04-18T18:49:00.000Z	HSNews		alltime ZERO Mb used (
2008-04-18T18:50:00.000Z	bwayne	HSNews	 you're swap's on.  it's just not used.
2008-04-18T18:51:00.000Z	HSNews		Ok, thanks
2008-04-18T18:51:00.000Z	bwayne	HSNews	 swap is rarely used in modern systems, with all the RAM and all.
