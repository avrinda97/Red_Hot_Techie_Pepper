2007-09-29T09:49:00.000Z	Forager		sorry scguy318...  DCHPDISCOVERY is looking to 255.255.255.255
2007-09-29T09:50:00.000Z	Forager		but my fisty isn't picking up it's dhcp assigned address.
2007-09-29T09:51:00.000Z	bulmer	Forager	what are you trying to do?
2007-09-29T09:51:00.000Z	Forager	bulmer	I'm trying to access the internet.
2007-09-29T09:52:00.000Z	bulmer	Forager	you are now are you not?
2007-09-29T09:54:00.000Z	Forager	bulmer	 Ubunto Box has a Linksys Instant gigabit card, (Works great in WinXP) wired to a Linksys WRTP54G voice router.
2007-09-29T09:54:00.000Z	bulmer	Forager	okay, your XP is dual booting with linux?
2007-09-29T09:55:00.000Z	bulmer	Forager	or that ubuntu is another separate machine?
2007-09-29T09:56:00.000Z	bulmer	Forager	is the router also acting as dHCP server?
2007-09-29T09:57:00.000Z	bulmer	Forager	how did you test this? are you using dhclient?
2007-09-29T09:59:00.000Z	Forager	bulmer	I have the router pages up on the laptop, so I have the Client table.  In ubuntu I'm in Terminal using ifconfig and Firefox.
2007-09-29T09:59:00.000Z	bulmer	Forager	what command you typed in ubuntu to recognize these?
2007-09-29T10:00:00.000Z	Forager	bulmer	I'm using ifconfig to check addresses and subnet, scguy318 suggested I use sudo ifup and ifdown to release/renew Ip addresses.
2007-09-29T10:01:00.000Z	bulmer	Forager	and what happens when you did do a ifdown and ifup? did you verify you have an ip address assigned? did you check /var/log/messages for telltale signs?
2007-09-29T10:04:00.000Z	bulmer	Forager	if it has 169.254.x.x it didnt get to talk to the dhcp server
2007-09-29T10:06:00.000Z	Forager	bulmer	That's the direction I was going in.  when I ran ifup, DCHPDISCOVER was broadcasting DHCP requests to the wrong subnet, but I don't know if that's relevant.
2007-09-29T10:06:00.000Z	bulmer	Forager	try man dhclient  to give you info on how to acquire ip address
2007-09-29T10:26:00.000Z	bulmer	Forager	man dhclient again..you used the wrong option it seems
