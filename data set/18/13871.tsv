2005-10-05T13:23:00.000Z	SGershon		Hi. Me back again.
2005-10-05T13:23:00.000Z	SGershon		I am downloading the install CD for Breezy. What I need is an Ubuntu system that comes with the drivers added from kernel 2.6.12-9.18 . How can I be sure  the iso found in http://releases.ubuntu.com/5.10/ have this kernel or newer?
2005-10-05T13:25:00.000Z	SGershon		Regarding my uqestion? Is this something obvious? That the release available to download has at least kernel 2.6.12-9.18 ?
2005-10-05T13:26:00.000Z	SGershon		I am asking, because as this is all beta and on-development, there may be things they don't make available.
2005-10-05T13:27:00.000Z	dooglus	SGershon	what is that .18 on the end?
2005-10-05T13:28:00.000Z	SGershon	dooglus	you asking me? hahaha.
2005-10-05T13:29:00.000Z	dooglus	SGershon	you seem to be insistant that you want at least that version.  does the 18 mean anything?
2005-10-05T13:31:00.000Z	dooglus	SGershon	the 'colony 5' image has this on it: /media/iso/pool/main/l/linux-meta/linux-image-386_2.6.12.15_i386.deb
2005-10-05T13:32:00.000Z	SGershon	dooglus	Seems nice. This is a package that I can install over Warty?
2005-10-05T13:33:00.000Z	dooglus	SGershon	I would suggest you just upgrade to breezy.
2005-10-05T13:33:00.000Z	dooglus	SGershon	if colony 5 doesn't have a new enough kernel, you can update the kernel using the online repositories anyway
2005-10-05T13:34:00.000Z	dooglus	SGershon	good point :)
2005-10-05T13:36:00.000Z	dooglus	SGershon	you can download a newer kernel using a different box and copy the .deb file over if you need to.
2005-10-05T13:37:00.000Z	dooglus	SGershon	the kernel is in 'main', along with lots of other stuff.
2005-10-05T13:39:00.000Z	SGershon	dooglus	where is "main"?
2005-10-05T13:40:00.000Z	dooglus	SGershon	you can find the most recent breezy kernel here: http://packages.ubuntu.com/breezy/base/linux-image-2.6.12-9-386
2005-11-16T06:23:00.000Z	dooglus	SGershon	you can "apt-get build-dep <package>" to get the packages you need to build <package>
2005-11-16T06:24:00.000Z	SGershon	dooglus	I'll try that now.
