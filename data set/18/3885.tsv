2009-07-13T04:33:00.000Z	Socah	Keranu	on MBR partition
2009-07-13T04:33:00.000Z	Keranu		Just the drive or on the same directory as the WinXP partition?
2009-07-13T04:34:00.000Z	Socah		Hello. I'm using Jaunty amd64 on laptop. My problem is: CPU frequency manager applet in GNOME is not working anymore - I can't change frequency. I tried to do fallowing things (as result of google search): - sudo dpkg-reconfigure gnome-applets and checking to run frequency manager to run as suid of root, also reinstalling gnome-applets, purging cpufreqd, cpufrequtils and reinstalling them. None of there helpt. Anyone could help me
2009-07-13T04:34:00.000Z	Keranu		Hmm, I've been having problems getting WinXP to dual boot with Ubuntu. I've tried installing it to the MBR drive before too
2009-07-13T04:34:00.000Z	Keranu		I think when I install it to the MBR, my computer still boots straight up into WinXP
2009-07-13T04:35:00.000Z	Keranu		But if I install it in other spots, it boots up Grub, but doesn't let me boot WinXP from there (error 21)
2009-07-13T04:35:00.000Z	Socah	Keranu	how many hdd drivers you got?
2009-07-13T04:35:00.000Z	Socah		drives*
2009-07-13T04:36:00.000Z	Keranu		I have two hard drives. At first I was trying to install Ubuntu on the same hard drive as WinXP, but just now I tried installing Ubuntu on my seperate SATA hard drive (which I installed Grub to the Ubuntu directory and PC still boots up just XP)
2009-07-13T04:36:00.000Z	Socah	Keranu	the problem is that
2009-07-13T04:36:00.000Z	Keranu		I've tried every directory when installing on the same hard drive as WinXP
2009-07-13T04:37:00.000Z	Socah	Keranu	you got 2 hdd's, each one got his own MBR, and propalby GRUB is installed on second's disk MBR
2009-07-13T04:37:00.000Z	Socah		so you still got windows loader
2009-07-13T04:38:00.000Z	Keranu		I was thinking the problem lied somewhere with that because when I go to install Ubuntu, it lists my SATA drive (not primary) first
2009-07-13T04:39:00.000Z	Keranu	Socah	should I install Ubuntu on my SATA drive and install Grub on hd0 or wherever my WinXP is on?
2009-07-13T04:40:00.000Z	Socah	Keranu	I think yes, you need to install GRUB on first's disk MBR
