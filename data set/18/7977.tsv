2008-09-02T06:06:00.000Z	meoblast001		my friend just installed ubuntu and is getting "Enter help for a list of commands"... what should he do?
2008-09-02T06:06:00.000Z	meoblast001		where is he at?
2008-09-02T06:07:00.000Z	zcat[1]	meoblast001	sounds like busybox.. aka install is fubar.. try installing again perhaps?
2008-09-02T06:07:00.000Z	meoblast001	zcat[1]	i guess he'll now hate ubuntu.. he'll probably decide to stick with windows now
2008-09-02T06:08:00.000Z	zcat[1]	meoblast001	happens..
2008-09-02T06:08:00.000Z	meoblast001	zcat[1]	he used wubi
2008-09-02T06:09:00.000Z	zcat[1]	meoblast001	hmmm.. have only used wubi once, it worked ok for me.. but I've heard horror stories. I assume he can still boot windows and uninstall it?
2008-09-02T06:09:00.000Z	meoblast001	zcat[1]	i hope
2008-09-02T06:10:00.000Z	meoblast001	zcat[1]	he's angry
2008-09-02T06:11:00.000Z	zcat[1]	meoblast001	does the live cd boot ok on his machine? I'd have tested that before doing anything else...
2008-09-02T06:12:00.000Z	meoblast001	zcat[1]	he doesnt have a live cd
2008-09-02T06:12:00.000Z	meoblast001	zcat[1]	does the live cd have an easy install mode for installing along side windows? cuz he would never want to repartition
2008-09-02T06:13:00.000Z	zcat[1]	meoblast001	Oh. well I'm sure he'll be able to boot into windows and add/remove uninstall ubuntu. and he might have better luck playing with the live cd
2008-09-02T06:13:00.000Z	meoblast001	zcat[1]	he'll probably not want to use ubuntu at all now
2008-09-02T06:13:00.000Z	zcat[1]	meoblast001	the live cd can do wubi as well, but if it didn't work this time it probably still won't work
2008-09-02T06:14:00.000Z	meoblast001	zcat[1]	im talking about when you get to the partitioning stage, to have an option to install while retaining windows without all the manual partitioning
2008-09-02T06:15:00.000Z	zcat[1]	meoblast001	yeah, the installer will autoresize windows but I wouldn't entirely trust it.. some OEM installs do 'weird shit' with the disks that confuses the installer and then things can go really wrong.
2008-09-02T06:18:00.000Z	meoblast001	zcat[1]	does it present this option in a nice easy to understand way.... remember this is a windows user that is going to be using this
