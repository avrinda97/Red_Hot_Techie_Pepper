2005-04-28T07:29:00.000Z	senator32		how can i get plug and play flash drives to work in unbuntu
2005-04-28T07:29:00.000Z	djm62	senator32	have you tried just sticking it in?
2005-04-28T07:32:00.000Z	djm62	senator32	ISTR it's /media/
2005-04-28T07:37:00.000Z	djm62	senator32	you shouldn't have to
2005-04-28T07:38:00.000Z	djm62	senator32	have you tried the Places menu?
2005-04-28T07:39:00.000Z	djm62	senator32	are you running kubuntu? or ubuntu-with-kde?
2005-04-28T07:41:00.000Z	djm62	senator32	if I were you, I'd attach an icon to the mount command and stick it on a toolbar
2005-04-28T07:41:00.000Z	djm62	senator32	or possibly kubuntu has a more integrated KDE HAL
2005-04-28T07:43:00.000Z	senator32	djm62	: thanks for youre help im downloading kbuntu
2005-04-28T07:43:00.000Z	djm62	senator32	I couldn't tell you, about kubuntu, but I think it would be better-integrated
2005-04-28T07:44:00.000Z	senator32	djm62	i was just interested wetehr or not it had the "portage-ish" install system
2005-04-28T07:45:00.000Z	senator32	djm62	ok another question, i realize that i can use sudo, but is there a way to actually log on as root
2005-04-28T07:47:00.000Z	djm62	senator32	anything debian-ish has the good good install system
2005-04-28T08:16:00.000Z	djm62	senator32	you can use the command chmod +S `which smbmnt`
2005-04-28T08:16:00.000Z	djm62	senator32	note the "backwards quote marks"
2005-04-28T08:17:00.000Z	djm62	senator32	"chmod +S `which smbmnt`"
2005-04-28T08:18:00.000Z	djm62	senator32	just like that
2005-04-28T08:20:00.000Z	djm62	senator32	sorry...getting old and forgetful
