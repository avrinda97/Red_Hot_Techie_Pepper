2007-05-23T07:08:00.000Z	kayef		hi, i installed a game called maryo chronicles using the smc-deb package but i don know how to load the game now, any idea?
2007-05-23T07:09:00.000Z	Pelo	kayef	 type maryo in the terminal
2007-05-23T07:09:00.000Z	kayef	Pelo	 it says bad command or file name
2007-05-23T07:09:00.000Z	Pelo	kayef	 what was the name of the deb package ?
2007-05-23T07:10:00.000Z	kayef	Pelo	smc-data_0.99.6-0~getdeb1_all
2007-05-23T07:10:00.000Z	Pelo	kayef	 try smc then
2007-05-23T07:11:00.000Z	kayef	Pelo	nope....doesn't work
2007-05-23T07:11:00.000Z	Pelo	kayef	check the site where you got the game from for instructions
2007-05-23T07:12:00.000Z	kayef	Pelo	i was looking there but seems tat there are no instructions to install......its jus a deb package and i dl it and double click and it installs but i cant seem to find the game now
2007-05-23T07:12:00.000Z	kayef	Pelo	http://www.getdeb.net/comment.php?rel_id=723   this is the site i dl from
2007-05-23T07:13:00.000Z	Pelo	kayef	 and no  menu entry was made ?  very odd
2007-05-23T07:13:00.000Z	kayef	Pelo	yeah....tats wat i'm wondering
2007-05-23T07:13:00.000Z	Pelo	kayef	 hold on I'm having a look
2007-05-23T07:13:00.000Z	kayef	Pelo	 the files are all in /usr/share/games/maryo
2007-05-23T07:15:00.000Z	Pelo	kayef	the page says tehre should be a menu entry in applicatiosn > games ,  but from reading a bit more I think you just installed the data package and forgot to install the game itself
2007-05-23T07:15:00.000Z	kayef	Pelo	so i need to install the other smc file?
2007-05-23T07:16:00.000Z	Pelo	kayef	 downlaod and isntall this   and you should be ok  http://www.getdeb.net/download.php?release=723&fpos=0
