2005-04-08T13:14:00.000Z	InitMass		is there any way to rotate jpg images in linux without quality loss?
2005-04-08T13:15:00.000Z	mjr	InitMass	jpegtran will do that
2005-04-20T12:55:00.000Z	mjr	InitMass	try esddsp
2005-04-20T12:56:00.000Z	InitMass	mjr	how?
2005-04-20T12:57:00.000Z	mjr	InitMass	esddsp realplayer (or whatever its name is)
2005-04-20T12:59:00.000Z	InitMass	mjr	no, that didn't work
2005-04-20T12:59:00.000Z	mjr	InitMass	well, might be regression
2005-04-20T13:02:00.000Z	InitMass	mjr	i want to use my external sound card which is on /dev/dsp1 but with that command you gave me it will use the internal
2005-04-27T14:26:00.000Z	mjr	InitMass	you write it...
2005-04-27T14:26:00.000Z	InitMass	mjr	i can't write swedish letters
2005-04-27T14:27:00.000Z	mjr	InitMass	you misunderstood; you get the support by coding it
2005-04-27T14:27:00.000Z	InitMass	mjr	so it's not supported yet?
2005-04-27T14:28:00.000Z	InitMass	mjr	can you recommend any other easy to use CLI editor?
2005-04-27T14:29:00.000Z	mjr	InitMass	the only utf-8 capable textmode editor I know is vim, and I suppose you wouldn't call that easy to use
2005-04-27T14:30:00.000Z	InitMass	mjr	no i wouldn't
2005-04-27T14:30:00.000Z	InitMass	mjr	but everyone that can use it says it's great
2005-04-27T14:34:00.000Z	InitMass	mjr	i think i did a test which showed that nano worked with utf8 if u started it in gnome-terminal
