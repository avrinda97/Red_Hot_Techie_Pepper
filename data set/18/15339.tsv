2005-11-27T16:07:00.000Z	jcole		does "sudo apt-get install linux-source-2.6.12" include the right ubuntu kernel source??
2005-11-27T16:07:00.000Z	jcole		tar jxvf /usr/src/linux-source-2.6.12.tar.bz2; cd linux-source-2.6.12/
2005-11-27T16:07:00.000Z	jcole		cp /boot/config-2.6.12-9-386 .config
2005-11-27T16:07:00.000Z	jcole		sudo make-kpkg kernel_image
2005-11-27T16:07:00.000Z	jcole		dpkg -i ../kernel-image-2.6.12_10.00.Custom_i386.deb
2005-11-27T16:07:00.000Z	jcole		^^^ i can't boot that kernel because it doesn't include raid support...
2005-11-27T16:08:00.000Z	jcole		what am i doing wrong?
2005-11-27T16:10:00.000Z	jcole		is the ubuntu source kernel named something else?
