2011-07-12T13:27:00.000Z	actionParsnip	sam1234	you may need natty, or a PPA. The driver in the Lucid repos is a bit old for your newer hardware
2011-07-12T13:28:00.000Z	actionParsnip	sam1234	lucid only has the 195 driver, you will need the 270 driver in Natty. Both Natty and Lucid desktop support ends at the same time
2011-07-12T13:30:00.000Z	actionParsnip	sam1234	why use Lucid?
2011-07-12T13:30:00.000Z	actionParsnip	sam1234	go to www.ubuntu.com and download Natty and install it
2011-07-12T13:35:00.000Z	actionParsnip	sam1234	bactrack isnt supported here in any way
2011-07-12T13:36:00.000Z	actionParsnip	sam1234	i suggest you join the channel for your distro.Backtrack is offtopic here
2011-07-12T13:46:00.000Z	actionParsnip	sam1234	you aren't using ubuntu
2011-07-12T13:46:00.000Z	actionParsnip	sam1234	you are using backtrack
2011-07-12T13:47:00.000Z	sam1234	actionParsnip	isnt it based on ubuntu ?
2011-07-12T13:47:00.000Z	actionParsnip	sam1234	ubuntu is based on debian, but I wouldn't say I was using debian.  I'm using ubuntu
2011-07-12T13:48:00.000Z	sam1234	actionParsnip	ok i got it
2011-07-12T13:48:00.000Z	actionParsnip	sam1234	backtrack is another spin on Ubuntu, ONLY canonical releases are supported here. This includes but isn't restricted to backtrack
2011-07-12T13:49:00.000Z	actionParsnip	sam1234	you will find the backtrack community is drastically smaller than the ubuntu community, you are also running all your apps as root which is grossly unsecure
