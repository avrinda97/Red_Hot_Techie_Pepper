2007-05-27T14:48:00.000Z	Aresilek	Lycus	 main:        Your connection has been rejected. :-O :-S
2007-05-27T14:48:00.000Z	Lycus	Aresilek	Have you connected to the VNC server before?
2007-05-27T14:49:00.000Z	Aresilek	Lycus	yes, it's an ultraVNC server
2007-05-27T14:49:00.000Z	Aresilek	Lycus	i've connected with ultravnc before
2007-05-27T14:50:00.000Z	Lycus	Aresilek	What did it ask before it rejected your connection?
2007-05-27T14:51:00.000Z	Lycus	Aresilek	Are you sure the server is running right now?
2007-05-27T14:56:00.000Z	Aresilek	Lycus	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/22760/
2007-05-27T14:58:00.000Z	Lycus	Aresilek	Sorry, I am not too knowledgeable about the technical aspects of VNC - someone else here may be. xvnc4viewer worked fine for me out of the box.
