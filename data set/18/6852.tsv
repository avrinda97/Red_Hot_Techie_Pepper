2008-03-13T22:29:00.000Z	siakattackj		I have problem with the wireless card in my toshiba laptop A210-183.... the card as it seems is RTL8187B
2008-03-13T22:29:00.000Z	siakattackj		I use ubuntu 7.10
2008-03-13T22:30:00.000Z	melch	siakattackj	have you tried ndiswrapper?
2008-03-13T22:30:00.000Z	siakattackj	melch	   yes
2008-03-13T22:31:00.000Z	siakattackj		I  also tried the kernel 24
2008-03-13T22:32:00.000Z	siakattackj	melch	i also tried the kernel 2.6.24
2008-03-13T22:33:00.000Z	melch		siakattack are you running 64 bit or 32 bit
2008-03-13T22:34:00.000Z	siakattackj	melch	 64
2008-03-13T22:35:00.000Z	melch		<siakattackj> is there a 64 bit xp driver for your card
2008-03-13T22:35:00.000Z	siakattackj		i think this is the problem because in forums other people with 32 bit and ndiswrapper had no problem
2008-03-13T22:35:00.000Z	siakattackj		"is there a 64 bit xp driver for your card"  that's a question??
2008-03-13T22:36:00.000Z	melch		if there is no 64 bit xp driver for your card you are out of luck unless you want to use the 32 bit version of ubuntu
2008-03-13T22:40:00.000Z	siakattackj	melch	  i don't have a problem to use a 32 bit driver if it works
2008-03-13T22:41:00.000Z	melch		u can't use a 32bit driver on 64bit siaka
2008-03-13T22:43:00.000Z	siakattackj	melch	  ooooo.... i hope the problem to be solved soon
2008-03-13T22:44:00.000Z	siakattackj	melch	   although thanks a lot for helping me
2008-03-13T22:44:00.000Z	melch		siaka you'll need to wait for ndiswrapper to support vista drivers
2008-03-13T22:45:00.000Z	siakattackj	melch	   ok.. i hope it won't take too long because i need the wireless
