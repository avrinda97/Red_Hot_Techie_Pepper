2011-11-20T21:09:00.000Z	matlock		because it's been an issue since gutsy
2011-11-20T21:10:00.000Z	matlock		...
2011-11-20T21:11:00.000Z	matlock		so, where's the gui to change the size of the resize area of the window?
2011-11-20T21:12:00.000Z	matlock		yes
2011-11-20T21:12:00.000Z	matlock		how do i change the size of the area that allows me to resize the windows
2011-11-20T21:12:00.000Z	matlock		because it's been an issue since gutsy
2011-11-20T21:12:00.000Z	matlock		and canonical has yet to address it
2011-11-20T21:12:00.000Z	matlock		and there's even been bugs listed to it
2011-11-20T21:12:00.000Z	matlock		but the fix is to edit some xml file
2011-11-20T21:13:00.000Z	matlock		it would be nice if canonical would actually make shit work like they say and actually add a gui that detects the current theme and applies the settings requested
2011-11-20T21:13:00.000Z	tamale_	matlock	do you know about alt-middle click resizing?  You can use the entire window for that.

2011-11-20T21:15:00.000Z	matlock	tamale_	so you're telling me that if i hold alt, then middle click it will permanently resize the area of the UI that allows me to resize windows?
2011-11-20T21:17:00.000Z	matlock	tamale_	not everyone has a three button mouse dude
2011-11-20T21:18:00.000Z	matlock	tamale_	and alt right click brings up a context menu
2011-11-20T21:18:00.000Z	matlock	tamale_	then go tackle them
2011-11-20T21:19:00.000Z	tamale_	matlock	did you try the second alternative I suggested?
2011-11-20T21:20:00.000Z	matlock	tamale_	i have repetedly responded to you with the same line of thought. i do not want 'workarounds' i want THE FIX
