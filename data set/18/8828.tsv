2007-09-18T10:45:00.000Z	PureEvilGeek		I like vista. a little ram hungry but there is nothing else out there that compares to its end user capabilities
2007-09-18T10:46:00.000Z	PureEvilGeek		for instance and admin can right click go to properties and change permissions after a few prompts:)
2007-09-18T10:46:00.000Z	PureEvilGeek		superdachs: no. i'm just a user who doesn't have an agenda against one OS or another and am realistic
2007-09-18T10:46:00.000Z	ArmedKing	PureEvilGeek	Vista is the best thing that ever happend to Linux ;-)
2007-09-18T10:47:00.000Z	PureEvilGeek	ArmedKing	ok how so? more users using ubuntu? can't be elite then if every one uses it;)
2007-09-18T10:48:00.000Z	PureEvilGeek	ArmedKing	i think sp1 will really help vista out with the few "bugs" most of us notice. a lot of improvements are going into the GUI from what i hear
2007-09-18T10:49:00.000Z	ArmedKing	PureEvilGeek	Few Bugs man i can run more games in Linux Using wine then i can in Vista LOL
2007-09-18T10:50:00.000Z	ArmedKing	PureEvilGeek	Agree i think WoW can easaly be build for Linux, Did you know you can get banned for running wow with wine because you run 3d party app haha
2007-09-18T10:51:00.000Z	PureEvilGeek	ArmedKing	its because the "third party testing program" *don't know what else to call it* can't run in wine correctly i think
2007-09-18T10:52:00.000Z	ArmedKing	PureEvilGeek	Well wow runs nice with wine i say nice as in Not great, I get about 20 fps in Linux but get 60fps in Windows
