2008-01-03T03:54:00.000Z	effie_jayx		Hello all
2008-01-03T03:54:00.000Z	effie_jayx		I need help setting up a samsung bixolon printer...
2008-01-03T03:55:00.000Z	effie_jayx		it's a ticket
2008-01-03T03:55:00.000Z	effie_jayx		printer...
2008-01-03T03:55:00.000Z	JanC	effie_jayx	it's not supported in Ubuntu?
2008-01-03T03:56:00.000Z	JanC	effie_jayx	and it's manual doesn't say "..."-comaptible ?
2008-01-03T03:57:00.000Z	effie_jayx	JanC	 I'm checking the manual
2008-01-03T04:07:00.000Z	JanC	effie_jayx	judging maria apt-get, aptitude, wajig, ...  ;)
2008-01-03T04:08:00.000Z	JanC	effie_jayx	judging from their website and openprinting.org, I think it won't work, unless they support emulation of some old printer language  :-/
2008-01-03T04:12:00.000Z	effie_jayx	JanC	 there are several printers that are compatibe
2008-01-03T04:12:00.000Z	effie_jayx	JanC	 an Epson 9 pin might do the trick
2008-01-03T04:15:00.000Z	JanC	effie_jayx	ah, good, many ticket printers support the old Epson ESC [ codes because a lot of old ticket software is still in use, I just wonder why they don't put that on their site  :-(
2008-01-03T04:16:00.000Z	effie_jayx	JanC	 But where can I find ESC driver...
2008-01-03T04:19:00.000Z	JanC	effie_jayx	maybe try "Epson-Dot_Matrix"
2008-01-03T04:24:00.000Z	effie_jayx	JanC	 it prints but with a space in between
2008-01-03T04:24:00.000Z	JanC	effie_jayx	at least you're getting close then  ;)
2008-01-03T04:24:00.000Z	effie_jayx	JanC	 yep ... close enough :D
2008-01-03T04:26:00.000Z	JanC	effie_jayx	I guess there might be drivers for other Epson dot-matrix printers that work better--maybe contact the openprinting.org people (e.g. Till Kampeter who works on the Ubuntu printer drivers) if they know more about it
