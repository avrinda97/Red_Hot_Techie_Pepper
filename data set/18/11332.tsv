2006-08-12T10:58:00.000Z	tbl		can anyone recommend a good dual-booting guide?
2006-08-12T10:58:00.000Z	tbl		(between ubuntu and windows)
2006-08-12T10:59:00.000Z	DShepherd	tbl	I really dont know of one.. but install windows first. then ubuntu... I personally dont think you need more info than that.. by hey.. I could be wrong
2006-08-12T11:01:00.000Z	tbl	DShepherd	wouldn't that install ubuntu on top of windows? :(
2006-08-12T11:02:00.000Z	DShepherd	tbl	no... but windows... is very itchy.. with a 'b' so install windows first. make space for ubuntu on your harddrive...
2006-08-12T11:07:00.000Z	tbl	DShepherd	yeah, I know windows sucks, but I still need it for work :(  But I really want to try ubuntu, and don't want to do it in a virtualized enviornment
2006-08-12T11:08:00.000Z	DShepherd	tbl	i didnt say it sucks... its just pushy when it comes on to dual booting with almost anything..
2006-08-12T11:08:00.000Z	tbl	DShepherd	well, *I* said it sucks :) ;)
2006-08-12T11:08:00.000Z	DShepherd	tbl	kool
2006-08-12T11:09:00.000Z	DShepherd	tbl	just install windows.. leave an unpartitioned portion for ubuntu.. and then install ubuntu there.. that should do fine.
2006-08-12T11:09:00.000Z	tbl	DShepherd	but how will I be able to switch between Windows and Ubuntu when booting?
2006-08-12T11:09:00.000Z	DShepherd	tbl	but there's tons of how-tos, and tutorials and videos on the web talking about dual booting
2006-08-12T11:09:00.000Z	DShepherd	tbl	when ubuntu is being installed it installs grub. grub gives you a menu to choose from.
2006-08-12T11:10:00.000Z	DShepherd	tbl	or any other OS for that matter..
2006-08-12T11:10:00.000Z	DShepherd	tbl	you can do a search for a video is that will help.. I am sure there tons out there..
2006-08-12T11:12:00.000Z	tbl	DShepherd	sethk, bcron, really appreciate the help :)
2006-08-12T11:12:00.000Z	DShepherd	tbl	np
