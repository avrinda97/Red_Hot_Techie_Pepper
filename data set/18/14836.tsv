2009-02-05T04:20:00.000Z	nickrud_	osiel	I strongly recommend that you don't upgrade, but rather get a much later version, 8.04 or 8.10 and do a fresh install
2009-02-05T04:20:00.000Z	nickrud_	osiel	you have to upgrade to 6.04 then 8.04 then 8.10 if desired

2009-02-05T04:22:00.000Z	nickrud_	osiel	you mean you want 8.10, but can't find it?  releases.ubuntu.com/8.10
