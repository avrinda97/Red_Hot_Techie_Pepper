2008-10-19T22:50:00.000Z	trollboy		I'm installing ubuntu server, I get the cdrom to boot, I choose "Install Ubuntu" and then says it can not mount the cdrom.  Is there any way around this?
2008-10-19T22:51:00.000Z	DCPom	trollboy	did you use the check CD feature?
2008-10-19T22:51:00.000Z	trollboy	DCPom	its doing the same thing
2008-10-19T22:52:00.000Z	trollboy		DCPom?
2008-10-19T22:53:00.000Z	DCPom	trollboy	i don't really know, can you mount other CDs?
2008-10-19T22:53:00.000Z	trollboy		Dunno, its a fresh install
2008-10-19T22:53:00.000Z	trollboy		just got the box
2008-10-19T22:54:00.000Z	DCPom	trollboy	do you have any OS installed right now?
2008-10-19T22:54:00.000Z	trollboy	DCPom	nope
2008-10-19T22:54:00.000Z	trollboy		Fresh build
2008-10-19T22:54:00.000Z	trollboy		blank drives
2008-10-19T22:54:00.000Z	trollboy		I'm going to be pulling the CDRom after install
2008-10-19T22:55:00.000Z	trollboy		Its currently primary master on the IDE chain
2008-10-19T22:55:00.000Z	DCPom	trollboy	could be a problem with the CD player, but that's my only idea
2008-10-19T22:55:00.000Z	DCPom	trollboy	or BIOS
2008-10-19T22:55:00.000Z	trollboy	DCPom	but it reads enough to boot
2008-10-19T22:55:00.000Z	DCPom	trollboy	maybe someone else can help you, i don
2008-10-19T22:55:00.000Z	DCPom	trollboy	maybe someone else can help you, i don't know what would cause that*
