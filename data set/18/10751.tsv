2007-06-30T10:53:00.000Z	NemesisD		now its not letting me add any connections in network settings
2007-06-30T10:54:00.000Z	NemesisD		and still wont let me put in a dns address
2007-06-30T10:55:00.000Z	NemesisD		does anybody know why i would not be able to add any dns servers in network settings?
2007-06-30T10:55:00.000Z	din	NemesisD	add them manually /etc/resolv.conf
2007-06-30T10:56:00.000Z	din	NemesisD	nameserver 1.2.3.4
2007-06-30T11:01:00.000Z	NemesisD	din	ok anything that i need to do now that that file is saved?
2007-06-30T11:06:00.000Z	NemesisD	din	what do i need to do after i save that file? the network settings is acting weird, those dns servers showed up and then just disappeared
2007-06-30T11:08:00.000Z	din	NemesisD	have you tried sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart ?
2007-06-30T11:09:00.000Z	NemesisD	din	trying that now
2007-06-30T11:12:00.000Z	NemesisD	din	i get errors, rtnetlink no such process, theres already a pid file, and so on and soforth, it seems to be releasing the ip but then we get eth1 errors no such device, theres already a pid file, this is all foreign to me
2007-06-30T11:16:00.000Z	din	NemesisD	sudo rm /var/run/dhclient* && sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
2007-06-30T11:17:00.000Z	NemesisD	din	still getting a mess of errors
2007-06-30T11:18:00.000Z	din	NemesisD	pastebin them
2007-06-30T11:18:00.000Z	NemesisD	din	im doing this over the phone, is there a way to tell if the device is working/being detected before i explain how pastebin works for him?
2007-06-30T11:19:00.000Z	NemesisD	din	also he has no network connectivity so pastebin will be difficult
2007-06-30T11:19:00.000Z	din	NemesisD	sudo dmesg
2007-06-30T11:19:00.000Z	din	NemesisD	this is true lol
2007-06-30T11:20:00.000Z	NemesisD	din	nevermind for now, the quitter just said he has to go to sleep
