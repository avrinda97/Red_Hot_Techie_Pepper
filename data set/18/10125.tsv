2008-05-06T03:41:00.000Z	jaym	orudie	not sure what the right answer is.. I usally try some combintation of disabling GL desktop and running 'compiz --replace' and eventually it works.. i dont reboot much =)
2008-05-06T03:42:00.000Z	jaym	orudie	there's a page out there if you search for dual monitors and delay .. in the ubuntu forums .. havent kept up with it, but lots of fixes generally like what im saying.
2008-05-06T03:43:00.000Z	orudie	jaym	should i disable desktop effects first ?
2008-05-06T03:43:00.000Z	jaym	orudie	try that, yeah .. not sure if it'll work for you.. some combo of disabling gl desktop and that command always works for me =/
2008-05-06T03:43:00.000Z	orudie	jaym	how can i disable desktop effects and then run compiz--replace
2008-05-06T03:44:00.000Z	jaym	orudie	system/ prefs / gldesktop
