2011-06-18T17:13:00.000Z	rubydiamond		Friends..
2011-06-18T17:13:00.000Z	rubydiamond		what is the difference between .. man crontab and man 5 crontab
2011-06-18T17:14:00.000Z	beli	rubydiamond	but there are different sections of the man pages
2011-06-18T17:14:00.000Z	rubydiamond	beli	hmm
2011-06-18T17:14:00.000Z	rubydiamond	beli	how do I know the specific command has multiple sections ?
2011-06-18T17:14:00.000Z	beli	rubydiamond	each section is related to special stuff...lets say system level...programming api......command syntax...
2011-06-18T17:14:00.000Z	beli	rubydiamond	take a look at the bottom of the man output
2011-06-18T17:15:00.000Z	beli	rubydiamond	for example try   man 2 syscall   ....its not a command...but system/programmig related
2011-06-18T17:16:00.000Z	rubydiamond	beli	yeah.. it tells about current number ... but how do I know what other numbers are supported
2011-06-18T17:16:00.000Z	rubydiamond	beli	do you mean "SEE ALSO"
2011-06-18T17:17:00.000Z	beli	rubydiamond	yes....and you need to know what you are searching before.....take a look at this overview: http://www.december.com/unix/ref/mansec.html
2011-06-18T17:18:00.000Z	rubydiamond	beli	thanks for the link .. now things are clear.
2011-06-18T17:18:00.000Z	beli	rubydiamond	another tool to use if you dont know what you are really searching for ist           info
2011-06-18T17:19:00.000Z	beli	rubydiamond	try         info man
2011-06-18T17:19:00.000Z	rubydiamond	beli	info command is not installed .. will install it
2011-06-18T17:19:00.000Z	beli		ruby: it does a more "allover" look
