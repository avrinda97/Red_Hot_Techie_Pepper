2008-12-27T00:05:00.000Z	FisherPrice		that is the nvidia installer
2008-12-27T00:06:00.000Z	jadedoto	FisherPrice	What kernel are you using?
2008-12-27T00:07:00.000Z	FisherPrice	jadedoto	newest intrepid
2008-12-27T00:07:00.000Z	FisherPrice	jadedoto	 2.6.25-2-386
2008-12-27T00:08:00.000Z	jadedoto	FisherPrice	Intrepid is using 2.5.27.x
2008-12-27T00:09:00.000Z	jadedoto	FisherPrice	The kernel headers were moved around, because the nvidia installer works fine on 2.6.27.x but not on 2.6.28.x yet... probably the same problem you're having
2008-12-27T00:18:00.000Z	FisherPrice	jadedoto	good pick up on my kernal version
2008-12-27T00:18:00.000Z	jadedoto	FisherPrice	did it work?
2008-12-27T00:30:00.000Z	FisherPrice	jadedoto	during my recent upgrade to intrepid my computer shutdown because of overheating... so the full upgrade didn't proceed as planned. is there anything i should do
2008-12-27T00:30:00.000Z	FisherPrice	jadedoto	like this kernal issue
2008-12-27T00:30:00.000Z	jadedoto	FisherPrice	Usually I just go back and just continue the upgrade
2008-12-27T00:31:00.000Z	FisherPrice	jadedoto	as in back into the "updatemangager -d"
2008-12-27T00:31:00.000Z	jadedoto	FisherPrice	Last time my laptop overheating compiling a kernel, I stuck it in the fridge =D
2008-12-27T00:31:00.000Z	jadedoto	FisherPrice	The -d switch will put you up with Jaunty devel, so don't do the -d.
2008-12-27T00:32:00.000Z	FisherPrice	jadedoto	usser well, im booting up with the 27 kernal
2008-12-27T00:32:00.000Z	jadedoto	FisherPrice	Unless you want jaunty-devel.... but I couldn't get the nvidia drivers to work at all, the *.28 kernel completely redid the video system....
2008-12-27T00:33:00.000Z	jadedoto	FisherPrice	nvidia drivers should work with *.27
2008-12-27T00:44:00.000Z	FisherPrice	jadedoto	i can't find the hardware manager in my systems menu.... what's the command line?
