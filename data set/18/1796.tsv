2011-06-12T00:39:00.000Z	nit-wit	rodd	your missing vista the script it may be as simple a a sudo update-grub in a Ubuntu terminal, put the HD" in the bios as sdc then sdb the sdc with the other entries.
2011-06-12T00:40:00.000Z	nit-wit	rodd	the vista boot stanza is missing it apperas to be there though.
2011-06-12T00:50:00.000Z	nit-wit	rodd	have you run a update-gru from Ubuntu, and has the vista ever run since the ubuntu install? and how did you resize the vista for installing the ubuntu? three questions here.
2011-06-12T00:51:00.000Z	rodd	nit-wit	yes I ran from Ubuntu, I don't have vista, just ubuntu on this hdd and win7 on another hdd. win7 runs just fine if I change the hdd boot order on bios
2011-06-12T00:55:00.000Z	nit-wit	rodd	do you have the bios reading the hd's in this order, sdc then sdb then sda last. You have a ms bootloader in the mbr of the sda HD it may be that grub is going there rather then the sdb mbr.
2011-06-12T00:57:00.000Z	rodd	nit-wit	in bios i have sdc1 first (ubuntu), sdb1 (win7) and I believe sda1 (just for backups, formatted as ntfs)
2011-06-12T00:59:00.000Z	nit-wit	rodd	I will look closer at the script myself but it may be that the sdb drive needs a chkdsk run grub is kind of picky in this area. worse case here you could leave t as is except using easybcd to boot Ubuntu , this would have the sdb before sdc in the bios.
2011-06-12T01:07:00.000Z	nit-wit	rodd	you know how to run a chkdsk /f/r on the vista I presume.
2011-06-12T01:09:00.000Z	nit-wit	rodd	cool I never used esybcd until testerday when I installed XP on a hd reading as W7 an extended with 3 Ubuntu, then the XP in  primary. I have grub2 boot to W7 now which gives me a choice of W7 or XP.
2011-06-12T01:10:00.000Z	rodd	nit-wit	ill run chkdsk and try easybcd
2011-06-12T01:11:00.000Z	nit-wit	rodd	I was surprised at how easy easybcd was it read the Ubuntu grub2 with know problem and brought me to my main grub2 menu, I do have the XP showing in the grub2 menu but it at tis point wont boot with the W7 being the acxtive=boot flag partition, but easybcd boots t.
2011-06-12T01:12:00.000Z	rodd	nit-wit	I hope it will do it, thanks for all the help
2011-06-12T01:13:00.000Z	rodd	nit-wit	if it doesnt, ill just boot by switching the order in bios, I only use ubuntu for dev
2011-06-12T01:14:00.000Z	nit-wit	rodd	there is a post bios menu you can choose rather then changing the bios per-session mine is f12, your may be different
2011-06-12T01:14:00.000Z	rodd	nit-wit	I gotta check that, I'm a bit outdated with computer stuff
2011-06-12T01:17:00.000Z	nit-wit	rodd	may be esc, or an f key, or even two keys but probably one. I think it is f8.
