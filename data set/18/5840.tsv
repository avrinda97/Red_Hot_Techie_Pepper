2008-10-29T17:55:00.000Z	KaiForce		is there a known issue with Nautilus soaking up RAM?
2008-10-29T17:55:00.000Z	spree	KaiForce	do you have a bunch of plugins on it?
2008-10-29T17:55:00.000Z	spree	KaiForce	You can switch to Thunar as default file manager if you want
2008-10-29T17:55:00.000Z	KaiForce		I don't even know what it does. I doubt I added any plugins
2008-10-29T17:56:00.000Z	KaiForce		spree - any downside?
2008-10-29T17:56:00.000Z	spree	KaiForce	less built-in tools
2008-10-29T17:56:00.000Z	KaiForce		probably not a problem for me the way I use Ubuntu.  Thanks spree.
2008-10-29T17:57:00.000Z	spree	KaiForce	I also THINK it doesn't do stuff like thumbnails and music previews
2008-10-29T17:57:00.000Z	KaiForce		not a problem for me.
2008-10-29T17:57:00.000Z	KaiForce	spree	 sounds like an upgrade to me ;)
2008-10-29T17:57:00.000Z	spree	KaiForce	well thunar is definitely faster feel free to try it out its already built in by default
2008-10-29T17:57:00.000Z	KaiForce		Nautilus doesn't do this to me all the time, but occasionally it just runs my system out of RAM
2008-10-29T17:58:00.000Z	spree	KaiForce	how much RAM do you have though
2008-10-29T17:58:00.000Z	KaiForce		BRB, switching
2008-10-29T17:58:00.000Z	KaiForce	spree	 512.
2008-10-29T17:58:00.000Z	spree	KaiForce	yeah you should be fine
2008-10-29T17:58:00.000Z	KaiForce		i don't do much though, just RDP session, and VLC for streaming tunes
2008-10-29T17:59:00.000Z	spree	KaiForce	going all out with bigger capacity hardware is fun to do in ubuntu though just fyi
