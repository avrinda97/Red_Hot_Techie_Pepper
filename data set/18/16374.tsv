2004-09-30T07:18:00.000Z	Dooh		Hi
2004-09-30T07:20:00.000Z	Dooh		Is KDE available for Ubuntu?
2004-09-30T07:22:00.000Z	lamont	Dooh	which arcitecture?
2004-09-30T07:22:00.000Z	Dooh	lamont	x86
2004-09-30T07:24:00.000Z	lamont	Dooh	well, you _can_ do it, but the libraries underneath things wind up being different, and ...  Much better to either grab from universe or compile from source.
2004-09-30T07:24:00.000Z	lamont	Dooh	that is, it is known to have significant issues, and is beyond the scope of any support we can provide...
2004-09-30T07:24:00.000Z	lamont	Dooh	universe is "everything else"... atm, it's almost all of debian/main, modulo FTBFS's
2004-09-30T07:26:00.000Z	lamont	Dooh	we're working on making the logs available, but if you see a package that has source in universe, but doesn't have binaries, holler and I'll (a) find the reason and (b) under certain circumstances, may be able to fix it for warty.
2004-09-30T07:26:00.000Z	lamont	Dooh	patches, of course, are welcome. :-)
2004-09-30T07:27:00.000Z	Dooh	lamont	great, thanx
2004-09-30T07:28:00.000Z	lamont	Dooh	note that I didn't promise to fix anything...:-)
2004-09-30T07:28:00.000Z	Dooh	lamont	i understand :)
2004-09-30T07:30:00.000Z	lamont	Dooh	to significantly simplify things, yes.
2004-09-30T07:32:00.000Z	lamont	Dooh	all the packages in our repository were built from source on our build daemons.
2004-09-30T07:34:00.000Z	lamont	Dooh	all the bits are tuned for p4, built to run on 486 and later
2004-09-30T07:35:00.000Z	lamont	Dooh	and built for p4/tuned p4 is something that we expect to actually try and see if it really makes a bit of difference sometime hoary-ish...
2004-09-30T07:36:00.000Z	lamont	Dooh	in gcc-3.3 terms, that's -march=i486 -mcpu=P4, iirc
2004-09-30T07:37:00.000Z	Dooh	lamont	yep, that's what i meant :)
