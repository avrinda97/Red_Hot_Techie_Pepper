2011-07-23T12:42:00.000Z	yelp14		hello #Ubuntu!
2011-07-23T12:42:00.000Z	yelp14		I was hoping to get some basic help on setting sshfs
2011-07-23T12:43:00.000Z	yelp14		yeah I've been using goodle
2011-07-23T12:43:00.000Z	yelp14		google*
2011-07-23T12:44:00.000Z	yelp14		I'm connecting with my server by using the publicIP -p PORT#
2011-07-23T12:45:00.000Z	yelp14		If I understand correctly, its supposed to look like 'sshfs user@host:directory mountpoint'
2011-07-23T12:46:00.000Z	yelp14		I guess I'm confused on what to put in the user@host spot, cause i'm getting the error 'missing host' returned
2011-07-23T12:47:00.000Z	llutz_	yelp14	what was you exact command?
2011-07-23T12:48:00.000Z	llutz_	yelp14	sshfs -p port# user@ip.adr.of.server:/home/dir /home/dir
2011-07-23T12:52:00.000Z	llutz_	yelp14	mkdir /home/anarchy/Videos
2011-07-23T12:52:00.000Z	llutz_	yelp14	it needs to be owned by your user
2011-07-23T12:52:00.000Z	llutz_	yelp14	serverside? you don't add spaces between host:/path
2011-07-23T12:53:00.000Z	llutz_	yelp14	if you have a space after :, it IS your problem
2011-07-23T12:56:00.000Z	yelp14	llutz_	Thanks man! I got it worked out!!
2011-07-23T12:58:00.000Z	yelp14	llutz_	this is so cool! is it possible to do this through the use of putty on a windows machine as well?
2011-07-23T12:58:00.000Z	llutz_	yelp14	uuh, no idea if windows/putty supports sshfs, you'd better ask allmgihty google. sry
2011-07-23T13:05:00.000Z	yelp14	llutz_	what's the best way to unmount? 'fusermount -u mountpoint' ??
2011-07-23T13:06:00.000Z	llutz_	yelp14	yes
