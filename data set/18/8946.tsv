2007-06-16T12:21:00.000Z	bharat862004		can someone help me install beryl and nvidia driver in ubuntu 6.06 LTS ??? :)
2007-06-16T12:22:00.000Z	Jordan_U	bharat862004	It is *much* easier to install in Feisty
2007-06-16T12:22:00.000Z	bharat862004	Jordan_U	i dont have feisty :(
2007-06-16T12:23:00.000Z	bharat862004	Jordan_U	tell me how to install in my ubuntu ??
2007-06-16T12:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U	bharat862004	I am suggesting that it would be easier and more stable to get it than install beryl on Dapper
2007-06-16T12:23:00.000Z	bharat862004	Jordan_U	but i dont have that man... understand
2007-06-16T12:24:00.000Z	Jordan_U	bharat862004	I don't know how to install it in Dapper, you might get better help in #ubuntu-effects
2007-06-16T12:24:00.000Z	bharat862004	Jordan_U	checking their also :(
2007-06-19T15:15:00.000Z	Jordan_U	bharat862004	Good, you saved yourself a lot of trouble :)
2007-06-19T15:16:00.000Z	bharat862004	Jordan_U	i am not sure about that yet ;)
2007-06-19T15:16:00.000Z	Jordan_U	bharat862004	Also the fact that they still don't support texture-from-pixmap and the fglrx drivers prevent me from using suspend on my laptop
2007-06-19T15:26:00.000Z	bharat862004	Jordan_U	as i already said its becoz they dont have good linux drivers :)
2007-06-19T15:26:00.000Z	Jordan_U	bharat862004	Yes, that doesn't make them any less of a PITA for me :)
2007-06-20T10:20:00.000Z	Jordan_U	bharat862004	32 bit
2007-06-20T10:21:00.000Z	bharat862004	Jordan_U	mister_roboto is 64 bit too fast to work than 32 bit ??? :)
2007-06-20T10:22:00.000Z	Jordan_U	bharat862004	Basically anything Open Source will work fine in 64 bit, but proprietary things like flash and codecs will take some work
2007-06-20T10:23:00.000Z	bharat862004	Jordan_U	hmm
2007-06-20T10:23:00.000Z	bharat862004	Jordan_U	mister_roboto then i am installing 32 bit version of ubuntu :)
