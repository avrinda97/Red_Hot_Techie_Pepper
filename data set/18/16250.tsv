2005-03-10T14:57:00.000Z	kimcascone		ok
2005-03-10T14:57:00.000Z	kimcascone		what do I look for in  intitab?
2005-03-10T14:57:00.000Z	kimcascone		ja I am trying to but the yaboot is only showing me Linux old when I tab
2005-03-10T14:59:00.000Z	kimcascone		where is that path set? is this listed in the inittab?
2005-03-10T15:00:00.000Z	kimcascone		no that's whjat I did
2005-03-10T15:00:00.000Z	kimcascone		I partitioned using the disk util
2005-03-10T15:00:00.000Z	kimcascone		then installed OSX again
2005-03-10T15:01:00.000Z	kimcascone		but I did the manual part6ition
2005-03-10T15:01:00.000Z	kimcascone		all the parts I made were HFS+
2005-03-10T15:01:00.000Z	trans_err	kimcascone	you can't install ubuntu on a hfs+
2005-03-10T15:03:00.000Z	trans_err	kimcascone	just wipe, repartition, leave free space for ubuntu, install osx, and install ubuntu
2005-03-10T15:03:00.000Z	trans_err	kimcascone	free space
2005-03-10T15:03:00.000Z	trans_err	kimcascone	let the ubuntu install partition and format the freespace
2005-03-10T15:03:00.000Z	trans_err	kimcascone	it is-- just dont partition some
2005-03-10T15:04:00.000Z	trans_err	kimcascone	depends how much you want in linux
2005-03-10T15:04:00.000Z	trans_err	kimcascone	i would suggest 5 at the least
2005-03-10T15:05:00.000Z	trans_err	kimcascone	do 10/5
