2007-08-12T08:19:00.000Z	Stormx2	aneb	From what?
2007-08-12T08:19:00.000Z	aneb	Stormx2	ubuntu 7.04 to ubuntu server 7.04
2007-08-12T08:19:00.000Z	Stormx2	aneb	How long have you been running the desktop version?
2007-08-12T08:20:00.000Z	aneb	Stormx2	well, i'm talking about doing this from a server
2007-08-12T08:20:00.000Z	Stormx2	aneb	Uhg, what?
2007-08-12T08:20:00.000Z	Stormx2	aneb	Like kauer said, explain more clearly.
2007-08-12T08:20:00.000Z	aneb	Stormx2	i installed ubuntu 7.04 on this server, and removed X11
2007-08-12T08:21:00.000Z	aneb	Stormx2	but it still has ubuntu elements in it, and i would like to clean things up.
2007-08-12T08:21:00.000Z	aneb	Stormx2	i can't do a reinstall :-)
2007-08-12T08:22:00.000Z	Stormx2	aneb	Uhg. Well I guess it would be possible to install ubuntu-server, and then remove all packages that ubuntu-server doesn't depend on...
2007-08-12T08:23:00.000Z	Stormx2	aneb	You'd need to reboot anyway, as the server runs a different kernel.
2007-08-12T08:24:00.000Z	Stormx2	aneb	There's no way you can run an ubuntu-server install without at least rebooting once.
2007-08-12T08:24:00.000Z	aneb	Stormx2	there is no ubuntu-server package
2007-08-12T08:24:00.000Z	Stormx2	aneb	Ah, hold on
2007-08-12T08:27:00.000Z	aneb	Stormx2	ubotu is a bot, not a person.
2007-08-12T08:27:00.000Z	Stormx2	aneb	I know, I was the one calling it.
2007-08-12T08:28:00.000Z	Stormx2	aneb	I already said that to him...
