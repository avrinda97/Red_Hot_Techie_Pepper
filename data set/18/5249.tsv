2009-01-25T19:39:00.000Z	mikevankuik		How can I login via remote desktop even if didn't activate it? I can access my machine thru ssh so is there anything I can set so I can use VNC to connect to it?
2009-01-25T19:40:00.000Z	stefg	mikevankuik	if you just need one particular app and have broadband you can simply ssh -X to that machine
2009-01-25T19:42:00.000Z	mikevankuik	stefg	cool :) tx :) but I would like to use my own VNC app :) X is so slow btw I would have to install an other VNC app on my mac too... :S
2009-01-25T19:43:00.000Z	mikevankuik	stefg	can't I just activate the remote desktop option thru ssh ? so I can normally vnc the thing?
2009-01-25T19:44:00.000Z	stefg	mikevankuik	on the long run i'd check x11vnc .. less bloated than vino, more flexible and only uses half of the cpu time (compared to vino)
2009-01-25T19:45:00.000Z	mikevankuik	stefg	cool I'll do that next but first I'll have to make a connection via VNC at first... because now I can only access the machine thru ssh
2009-01-25T19:46:00.000Z	stefg	mikevankuik	sudo apt-get install x11vnc ... then run it :-)
2009-01-25T19:46:00.000Z	mikevankuik	stefg	and I would like to be able to give it some commands in X too (I'm no ssh guru although I'm getting better)
2009-01-25T19:46:00.000Z	mikevankuik	stefg	done
2009-01-25T19:47:00.000Z	mikevankuik	stefg	but it will still not let me connect
2009-01-25T19:48:00.000Z	stefg	mikevankuik	and make sure that vino is not in the way (hogging port 5900)

2009-01-25T19:49:00.000Z	stefg	mikevankuik	evil admin.... no bedtime story tonight :-) ... don't use root !
2009-01-25T19:50:00.000Z	mikevankuik	stefg	I'm evol :D and I hate typing sudo (A)
2009-01-25T19:50:00.000Z	mikevankuik	stefg	ok face it I'm laisy :P but the thing is a internal server :) so I'm not that worried :)
2009-01-25T19:51:00.000Z	stefg	mikevankuik	i think that's a built in security feature. it won't let connect root to an xsession
2009-01-25T19:53:00.000Z	mikevankuik	stefg	new output with the user mike http://pastebin.com/d490d3e7d
2009-01-25T19:54:00.000Z	stefg	mikevankuik	kill the other instance first...
