2008-10-15T20:09:00.000Z	joaopinto	tv7497	erm, you are not expected to exit after setting the display variable
2008-10-15T20:10:00.000Z	joaopinto	tv7497	and if you are doing a graphical login with the oracle user, you do not need to set the display var
2008-10-15T20:11:00.000Z	tv7497	joaopinto	okiee will try that and let you know in a minute sir but graphical login you mean gksudo ???
2008-10-15T20:11:00.000Z	joaopinto	tv7497	since you are logging int with root (which is BAD), it will probably be easier to ssh -X oracle@localhost, that will take care of setting up the display var
2008-10-15T20:11:00.000Z	joaopinto	tv7497	no, i mean, like, when logging into the system, using the oracle user
2008-10-15T20:12:00.000Z	joaopinto	tv7497	and there was a repository for Oracle XE, much easier to install
2008-10-15T20:13:00.000Z	joaopinto	tv7497	su - oracle, then "passwd"
2008-10-15T20:13:00.000Z	tv7497	joaopinto	ok sir
2008-10-15T20:16:00.000Z	tv7497	joaopinto	http://paste.ubuntu.com/57925/
2008-10-15T20:17:00.000Z	tv7497	joaopinto	well what to do now sir ?
2008-10-15T20:21:00.000Z	tv7497	joaopinto	sir trying to enter through the login screen it says the admin has disabled your account
2008-10-15T20:22:00.000Z	joaopinto	tv7497	I am sorry, but you really need an introduction to linux/unix before installing Oracle on a *nix system
2008-10-15T20:23:00.000Z	tv7497	joaopinto	willing to learn sir :) i may be foolish though but whats the wrong i am doing sir
2008-10-15T20:24:00.000Z	joaopinto	tv7497	don't have enough time for a step-by-step tutoring right now, sorry :\
2008-10-15T20:24:00.000Z	tv7497	joaopinto	okiee sir :)
2008-10-15T20:31:00.000Z	tv7497	joaopinto	sir well could you just say what did i do wrong not a step by step tutorial rather a line of wisdom :d
2008-10-15T20:31:00.000Z	joaopinto	tv7497	you are doing too many mistakes because you just doing copy/paste from a tutorial without understanding, nothing I can fix with a single line, sorry
