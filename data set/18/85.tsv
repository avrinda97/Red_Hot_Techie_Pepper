2012-09-26T14:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	yeaux	playdeb has snowglobe, you'll be able to install via software centre once you add their PPA
2012-09-26T14:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	yeaux	http://www.playdeb.net/updates/ubuntu/10.10/?q=life
2012-09-26T14:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	yeaux	you can use those links after you run:  wget http://archive.getdeb.net/install_deb/playdeb_0.3-1~getdeb1_all.deb; sudo dpkg -i ./playdeb_0.3-1~getdeb1_all.deb; rm ./playdeb_0.3-1~getdeb1_all.deb; sudo apt-get update
2012-09-26T14:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	yeaux	yes, read what I put next...
2012-09-26T14:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	yeaux	you need the extra source so you can use the links
2012-09-26T14:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	yeaux	why the 'hehehe' on the end?
2012-09-26T14:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	yeaux	its not needed, it has no value to the situation
2012-09-26T14:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	yeaux	all you have to do is copy and paste the command I gave and run it, nopthing more
2012-09-26T14:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	yeaux	inviting complete strangers onto your PC isn't wise
2012-09-26T14:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	yeaux	just copy the command as one line and run it in terminal. Its nothing complicated
2012-09-26T14:42:00.000Z	yeaux	ActionParsnip	youre the best!
