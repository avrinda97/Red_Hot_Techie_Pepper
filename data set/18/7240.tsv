2008-01-19T05:58:00.000Z	huadpe		Hi, can anyone help me connect to my office's server, I can't figure out the GUI menu for it.
2008-01-19T05:59:00.000Z	huadpe		I have an IP for the server, with a username and pw for the account on the server.
2008-01-19T05:59:00.000Z	andi5	huadpe	is there an ssh server running or what else?
2008-01-19T06:00:00.000Z	andi5	huadpe	or have you tried to point your brower to that ip?
2008-01-19T06:01:00.000Z	andi5	huadpe	browser, even
2008-01-19T06:01:00.000Z	huadpe	andi5	tried on firefix, didnt load anything
2008-01-19T06:02:00.000Z	andi5	huadpe	if you do not know how to connect to it, you might want to try a port scan on it :-)  ... but make sure that you do not get blocked completely
2008-01-19T06:03:00.000Z	huadpe	andi5	It seems like there should be a simple solution for this.  The only point of this server is for remote login.
2008-01-19T06:04:00.000Z	andi5	huadpe	"remote login" meaning what if not shell (telnet or ssh)?  is there some special windows server program running you did not mention or vnc?
2008-01-19T06:06:00.000Z	andi5	huadpe	have you tried to access it with the file browser via places > connect to server?
2008-01-19T06:06:00.000Z	huadpe	andi5	I cant figure out what to type in to the connect to server menu.  There is no password option in any of the choices.
2008-01-19T06:07:00.000Z	andi5	huadpe	i think it will ask you for a password at a later step
2008-01-19T06:09:00.000Z	huadpe	andi5	I've been trying, It keeps failing.
2008-01-19T06:10:00.000Z	andi5	huadpe	does it ask you for a password?
2008-01-19T06:11:00.000Z	huadpe	andi5	no, it just says "could not open ftp://editors@ip [break] service not available
2008-01-19T06:12:00.000Z	andi5	huadpe	i do not know the english term, but i assume you chose "windows share"?
2008-01-19T06:12:00.000Z	huadpe	andi5	public FTP, private FTP and windows share
2008-01-19T06:15:00.000Z	huadpe	andi5	I got the server mounted on the windows option for "connect to server," but I can't display any content because i didn't get a password prompt
