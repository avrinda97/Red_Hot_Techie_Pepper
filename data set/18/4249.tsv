2009-05-10T09:49:00.000Z	damentz		what is ubuntu's policy on new proprietary drivers?
2009-05-10T09:50:00.000Z	damentz		do they backport new amd and nvidia drivers?
2009-05-10T09:50:00.000Z	damentz		180.53 fixes a lot of issues in 180.44 for instance
2009-05-10T09:50:00.000Z	damentz		and 185 fixes a lot of desktop compositing performance issues
2009-05-10T09:50:00.000Z	mib_ye5sb7tq	damentz	envy is likely the best choise to use later drivers
2009-05-10T09:50:00.000Z	damentz		right, i would just install it myself manually
2009-05-10T09:50:00.000Z	damentz		but when a new kernel comes in... it's a pain to reinstall
2009-05-10T09:50:00.000Z	damentz		so i would like it to be in the repo
2009-05-10T09:51:00.000Z	damentz		especially if it's marked as a stable driver by nvidia
2009-05-10T09:52:00.000Z	damentz	mib_ye5sb7tq	i just wish they would backport drivers more often
2009-05-10T09:52:00.000Z	damentz		more often than not, new versions of the catalyst or nvidia drivers fix issues than break functionality
2009-05-10T09:53:00.000Z	mib_ye5sb7tq	damentz	most new drivers get applied the the kernel main branch, restricted drivers are outside the development model.
2009-05-10T09:55:00.000Z	damentz	mib_ye5sb7tq	but they're still as important
2009-05-10T09:55:00.000Z	mib_ye5sb7tq	damentz	well you should be whining to nvidia not ubuntu devs.
2009-05-10T09:56:00.000Z	damentz	mib_ye5sb7tq	that doesn't make sense, the ubuntu devs choose when to update their packages or not
2009-05-10T09:56:00.000Z	damentz		nvidia just fixes their drivers asthey go
2009-05-10T09:56:00.000Z	mib_ye5sb7tq	damentz	because the ubuntu devs dont update the drivers, thats upstram.
2009-05-10T09:58:00.000Z	damentz	mib_ye5sb7tq	right, so they package newer/better versions so users don't have to use envy
