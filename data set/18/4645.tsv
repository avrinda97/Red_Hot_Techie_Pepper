2009-03-10T12:47:00.000Z	mortne1		Anyone here familiar with xev output?
2009-03-10T12:47:00.000Z	Hemebond	mortne1	Ya, I've used it.
2009-03-10T12:48:00.000Z	mortne1	Hemebond	http://paste.ubuntu.com/129148/ are three presses of my volume-up and volume-down buttons. They look very different from pressing the 'normal' keys. What do I do to map them to something useful?
2009-03-10T12:49:00.000Z	mortne1	Hemebond	it's a logitech diNovo mini usb/bluetooth keyboard
2009-03-10T12:49:00.000Z	Hemebond	mortne1	How are you mapping them?
2009-03-10T12:50:00.000Z	mortne1	Hemebond	I didn't do anything yet - I'm trying to get them to work, but I cannot seem to find the keycodes that I should use for xmodmap or similar
2009-03-10T12:50:00.000Z	Hemebond	mortne1	System > Preferences > Keyboard Shortcuts won't let you map them?
2009-03-10T12:50:00.000Z	Hemebond	mortne1	It'll also give you the code you need to xmodmap
2009-03-10T12:51:00.000Z	mortne1	Hemebond	I don't have a System->Preferences thing. I'm running mythbuntu, but if you can tell me how to get the preferences menu item, I'd be *very* happy
2009-03-10T12:54:00.000Z	Hemebond	mortne1	I've never used mythbuntu. Not even sure what it is exactly.
2009-03-10T12:55:00.000Z	mortne1	Hemebond	It's a dist of ubuntu packaged with mythTV and with some rather nice entries from the Applications menu removed, obviously.
2009-03-10T12:55:00.000Z	Hemebond	mortne1	So you have no preferences menu at all?
2009-03-10T12:55:00.000Z	Hemebond	mortne1	That's a bit crap.
2009-03-10T12:56:00.000Z	mortne1	Hemebond	I guess so, but now it's already installed, and if menu entries can be added, I'd prefer that
2009-03-10T12:56:00.000Z	mortne1	Hemebond	Agres
2009-03-10T12:56:00.000Z	mortne1	Hemebond	(agree)
2009-03-10T12:59:00.000Z	Hemebond	mortne1	Do you have xmodmap installed?
2009-03-10T13:01:00.000Z	mortne1	Hemebond	& ActionParsnip: Looking into keytough right now...
