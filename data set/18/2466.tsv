2010-05-09T05:45:00.000Z	Rongam		hello, trying to figure out how to stop gdm and xserver
2010-05-09T05:45:00.000Z	minimec	Rongam	sudo stop gdm
2010-05-09T05:46:00.000Z	minimec	Rongam	sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop
2010-05-09T05:47:00.000Z	minimec	Rongam	So your xserver is immortal... ;)
2010-05-09T05:49:00.000Z	Rongam	minimec	 any other ideas?
2010-05-09T05:50:00.000Z	minimec	Rongam	OPen a console, load sudo top and kill the X process.
2010-05-09T05:51:00.000Z	Rongam	minimec	sorry a bit confused, load sudo top?
2010-05-09T05:52:00.000Z	Rongam	minimec	neat, will try, thanks
2010-05-09T05:55:00.000Z	Rongam	minimec	 tried that with ctrl alt f1, then kill xorg but it immediately reloads in a gui
2010-05-09T05:56:00.000Z	Rongam	minimec	trying to install nvidia drivers so reloading a gui is undesired.
2010-05-09T05:56:00.000Z	minimec	Rongam	USe the gtk-jockey tool, please...
2010-05-09T05:57:00.000Z	Rongam	minimec	sorry, gtk-jockey tool
2010-05-09T05:58:00.000Z	minimec	Rongam	>System >administration >Hardware Drivers if there is the nvidia possibility, eable it.
2010-05-09T06:01:00.000Z	Rongam	minimec	 it is enabled currently (just checked), but not working properly, ubuntu is loading in low-graphics mode, always does this after an update.  Normally I reinstall the nvidia driver and it works, but i always have a new problem stopping the xserver :(
2010-05-09T06:03:00.000Z	minimec	Rongam	OK. If you know, what you're doing... I see no reason why 'sudo stop gdm' or 'sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop' don't work for you.
2010-05-09T06:04:00.000Z	Rongam	minimec	 lol, I have no idea what I am doing, thanks for the try tho.
2010-05-09T06:21:00.000Z	Rongam	minimec	 thanks for your help, I did finally get it shut down and working as desired
2010-05-09T06:21:00.000Z	minimec	Rongam	no problem ;)
