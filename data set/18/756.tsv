2011-09-25T05:02:00.000Z	mingdao_	xaviergmail	did you get an answer?
2011-09-25T05:03:00.000Z	mingdao_	xaviergmail	did you burn a CD from an ISO image you downloaded?
2011-09-25T05:04:00.000Z	mingdao_	xaviergmail	there is an md5sum for that ISO image ... you need to compare it to your ISO
2011-09-25T05:04:00.000Z	mingdao_	xaviergmail	md5sum image.iso (replace image with the name of the ISO image) will give you the md5sum of the ISO image
2011-09-25T05:05:00.000Z	mingdao_	xaviergmail	then if your ISO image was good, put your CD in the CD-ROM drive and in a terminal cd to the directory with the ISO image
2011-09-25T05:05:00.000Z	mingdao_	xaviergmail	in that directory with the CD in the drive issue "cmp /dev/sr0 image.iso"
2011-09-25T05:05:00.000Z	mingdao_	xaviergmail	if your CD-ROM drive is ISO
2011-09-25T05:06:00.000Z	mingdao_	xaviergmail	start by getting the md5sum of the ISO from wherever you downloaded it
2011-09-25T05:09:00.000Z	mingdao_	xaviergmail	sorry, had to help my daughter
2011-09-25T05:09:00.000Z	mingdao_	xaviergmail	the md5sum of your ISO image is good?
2011-09-25T05:10:00.000Z	xaviergmail	mingdao_	yes
2011-09-25T05:11:00.000Z	mingdao_	xaviergmail	issue "ls -l /dev/cdrom" in a terminal and see what it is a link to
2011-09-25T05:11:00.000Z	mingdao_	xaviergmail	something like /dev/cdrom -> sr0
2011-09-25T05:12:00.000Z	xaviergmail	mingdao_	yep
2011-09-25T05:12:00.000Z	mingdao_	xaviergmail	now issue "cmp /dev/sr0 image.iso"
2011-09-25T05:12:00.000Z	mingdao_	xaviergmail	it will take a few minutes, maybe, but should return to a prompt with no output
2011-09-25T05:13:00.000Z	mingdao_	xaviergmail	if so your CD is the same as your ISO image
2011-09-25T05:13:00.000Z	mingdao_	xaviergmail	there are other ways to do it, but IMO this is the easiest/quickest and is reliable
