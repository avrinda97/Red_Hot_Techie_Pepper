2009-05-20T11:13:00.000Z	ariqs		when I'm in ubuntu, my connection gets used for downloading shit that i don't even know what it is
2009-05-20T11:14:00.000Z	ariqs		I don't like stuff downloading without me telling it to!
2009-05-20T11:14:00.000Z	maco	ariqs	like what?
2009-05-20T11:14:00.000Z	maco	ariqs	are you referring to updates?
2009-05-20T11:14:00.000Z	ariqs	maco	i'm not sure what I'm referring to
2009-05-20T11:14:00.000Z	maco	ariqs	every day it'll query the server (i think 8AM local time) to ask if there are updates available
2009-05-20T11:14:00.000Z	maco	ariqs	it's just asking if there are updates, then
2009-05-20T11:15:00.000Z	maco	ariqs	the default setting is that if it is told that there are updates, it'll ask you before downloading them
2009-05-20T11:17:00.000Z	maco	ariqs	how many repositories do you have enabled? it downloads a list of what packages there are for each repository. if you have fewer repositories (example: if you are not a developer, disable source repositories) it'll take less time
2009-05-20T11:17:00.000Z	maco	ariqs	it then compares the list it got to the one it already had to see if anything changed
2009-05-20T11:39:00.000Z	maco	ariqs	kubuntu didnt exist at first, that's why ubuntu doesnt have the g
2009-05-20T11:20:00.000Z	maco	ariqs	when you want to force it to check, you can do that in system -> administration -> software updates. i recommend doing that at least once a week, just to be safe with regard to security
2009-05-20T11:39:00.000Z	maco	ariqs	ubuntu was the original, then kubuntu was a community project that canonical decided to hire Riddell to work on. they didnt want to change Ubuntu's name later
2011-02-05T06:06:00.000Z	maco	ariqs	there's unrar-nonfree
2011-02-05T06:06:00.000Z	maco	ariqs	its not open source but it can do more complex rars
2011-02-05T06:08:00.000Z	ariqs	maco	Package unrar-nonfree is not available, but is referred to by another package.
2011-02-05T06:08:00.000Z	maco	ariqs	enabe multiverse in your software sources
2011-02-05T06:09:00.000Z	maco	ariqs	sorry
