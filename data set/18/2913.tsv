2010-01-24T19:19:00.000Z	ikonia	jakiw	ok - so remove the packages you don't need
2010-01-24T19:16:00.000Z	ikonia	jakiw	open up the package manager, search for the packages and mark them for removal
2010-01-24T19:17:00.000Z	ikonia	jakiw	removing it will stop it
2010-01-24T19:17:00.000Z	jakiw	ikonia	i removed all packages with typo3 (3 packages) in it, but it didnt help
2010-01-24T19:19:00.000Z	ikonia	jakiw	open the package manager, search for apache2 and remove it, as you intitially wanted to
2010-01-24T19:19:00.000Z	ikonia	jakiw	if you had removed the packages you said you had, it wouldn't be running
2010-01-24T19:20:00.000Z	ikonia	jakiw	it will only cause you problems with xammp down the line (although why you don't use lamp that is fully supported I don't know)
2010-01-24T19:20:00.000Z	jakiw	ikonia	xampp for linux is lampp, i am using lampp!
2010-01-24T19:22:00.000Z	jakiw	ikonia	i removed 2 packages with apache2 in the name (apache2 itself wasnt even installed)...the server is still running! i think i installed it when i tried to install a CMS called typo 3 via synaptic and it just got its own server....
2010-01-24T19:23:00.000Z	ikonia	jakiw	so if you have removed the packages and reboot you'll find myourself in a clean state
2010-01-24T19:24:00.000Z	jakiw	ikonia	lol, sry i made a stupid mistake... i didnt reload it just showed me the cache
2010-01-24T19:24:00.000Z	ikonia	jakiw	please stop that
2010-01-24T19:24:00.000Z	ikonia	jakiw	sorry - not you
