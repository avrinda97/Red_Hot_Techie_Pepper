2008-11-16T11:09:00.000Z	fryguy	tritium	the root account isn't disabled, you just aren't provided with the password
2008-11-16T11:09:00.000Z	tritium	fryguy	no, it's disabled
2008-11-16T11:10:00.000Z	fryguy	tritium	that's not true. It's possible to log in as root on a stock ubuntu install without changing anything, therefore the account isn't "disabled"
2008-11-16T11:10:00.000Z	tritium	fryguy	no.  "man passwd" and look for the -l (lock) switch.
2008-11-16T11:11:00.000Z	fryguy	tritium	more specifically it's possible to obtain a login shell with id=0, and a corresponding entry in the utmp table
2008-11-16T11:12:00.000Z	fryguy	tritium	"sudo su -" provides you with a login shell on a default ubuntu install.  is it recommended? no? does it prove that the account isn't "disabled"? yes
2008-11-16T11:14:00.000Z	tritium	fryguy	read the wiki page.  The term "disabled" is appropriate.
2008-11-16T11:15:00.000Z	fryguy	tritium	where on that page does it explain "disabled" the word disabled occurs once in the page in a header explaining why it's good.  It doesn't specify how the user is disabled
2008-11-16T11:16:00.000Z	tritium	fryguy	read the passwd manpage, if you prefer.  The account is "locked".  No sense arguing over semantics.
2008-11-16T11:17:00.000Z	fryguy	tritium	so then why does sudo su - work? and why does logging in as root while having a public key in /root/.ssh/authorized_keys work? And why do entries in utmp and wtmp appear when these actions occur (which display a list of logged in users).
2008-11-16T11:17:00.000Z	tritium	fryguy	drop it.
2008-11-16T11:18:00.000Z	fryguy	tritium	and why does root have a shell associated for it in /etc/passwd
2008-11-16T11:18:00.000Z	tritium	fryguy	drop it, stay on topic, and read what I've sent you.

2009-04-28T06:41:00.000Z	tritium	fryguy	you've been repeating that a bit too often
2009-04-28T06:51:00.000Z	tritium	fryguy	should be unchanged from 8.10
2009-04-28T06:52:00.000Z	fryguy	tritium	well it's not, now when I try to ssh to sites, I get prompted for a passphrase.  there is no passphrase on the key, and ssh -vvv output shows this, and so when I press enter it states no passphrase given, trying next key, of which there is none so it jumps to keyboard interactive login.
