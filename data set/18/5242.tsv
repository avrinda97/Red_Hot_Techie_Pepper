2010-04-27T09:29:00.000Z	jmoiron		any way to boot ubuntu without booting into x
2010-04-27T09:29:00.000Z	pepee	jmoiron	yep, "recovery something"
2010-04-27T09:29:00.000Z	jmoiron	pepee	no, that boots into single user mode, which asks me for a root password
2010-04-27T09:29:00.000Z	pepee	jmoiron	do you wanna change your password?
2010-04-27T09:30:00.000Z	jmoiron	pepee	i want to fix my system
2010-04-27T09:30:00.000Z	pepee	jmoiron	what's the problem?
2010-04-27T09:30:00.000Z	jmoiron	pepee	ubuntu 10.04 upgrade doesn't like my setup
2010-04-27T09:31:00.000Z	pepee	jmoiron	/join #ubuntu+1
2010-04-27T09:31:00.000Z	pepee	jmoiron	and if you want a shell, you have to edit the kernel line in grub
2010-04-27T09:31:00.000Z	jmoiron	pepee	that's fine, i'd like a login if possible
2010-04-27T09:32:00.000Z	pepee	jmoiron	you have to remove all the kernel options (except root=...) and add init=/bin/bash
2010-04-27T09:33:00.000Z	pepee	jmoiron	remove "single" in the kernel options line
2010-04-27T09:33:00.000Z	jmoiron	pepee	neat, seems to have worked
2010-04-27T09:33:00.000Z	pepee	jmoiron	what did you do?
2010-04-27T09:34:00.000Z	jmoiron	pepee	i just did the regular upgrade as suggested
2010-04-27T09:34:00.000Z	pepee	jmoiron	heh ok
2010-04-27T09:42:00.000Z	jmoiron	pepee	thanks a lot, i figured out what hosed my system and it's booted fine now
2010-04-27T09:42:00.000Z	pepee	jmoiron	np. good luck ;)
