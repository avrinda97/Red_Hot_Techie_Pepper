2006-06-03T05:36:00.000Z	Snow_Shelter		It will have an NVIDIA name in that section
2006-06-03T05:36:00.000Z	Snow_Shelter		then do 'sudo killall gdm'
2006-06-03T05:37:00.000Z	Snow_Shelter		then log into the tty
2006-06-03T05:37:00.000Z	Snow_Shelter		and do 'sudo su'
2006-06-03T05:37:00.000Z	Snow_Shelter		then do 'gdm' as root
2006-06-03T05:37:00.000Z	Snow_Shelter		and you'll have nVidia drivers
2006-06-03T05:37:00.000Z	Snow_Shelter		you'll loose all the apps you have running in X
2006-06-03T05:37:00.000Z	ompaul	Snow_Shelter	no the wrong, and long way
2006-06-03T05:37:00.000Z	Snow_Shelter	ompaul	well that works for me
2006-06-03T05:38:00.000Z	ompaul	Snow_Shelter	for one we never encourage users to use sudo su, sudo -i if you must, but for what you want, na
2006-06-03T05:38:00.000Z	Snow_Shelter	ompaul	that takes all of 30 seconds to do
2006-06-03T05:38:00.000Z	Snow_Shelter	ompaul	well gdm must run as root, so therefore, you can't use sudo -i because it wont work
2006-06-03T05:39:00.000Z	ompaul	Snow_Shelter	sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop&& sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start
2006-06-03T05:39:00.000Z	Snow_Shelter	ompaul	well it's either do my way of sudo su, or reboot
2006-06-03T05:39:00.000Z	Snow_Shelter	ompaul	or that way... I wish Ubuntu had 'service' that is such a useful command
2006-06-03T05:40:00.000Z	ompaul	Snow_Shelter	this has lots of good tools when used correctly,  you never ever have to use root
2006-06-03T05:43:00.000Z	Snow_Shelter	ompaul	yea, I know it's disabled, why do you think you use sudo?
2006-06-03T05:45:00.000Z	ompaul	Snow_Shelter	well no system designer should disable a feature until they have a way to do everything without that feature, the way it is here is what you do on the privacy of your own command line is your business, however there is a reasonable expectation on the part of people helping here that (A) root is not in use or enabled and (B) we point all users who ask for root to that page and ask them to consider sudo
