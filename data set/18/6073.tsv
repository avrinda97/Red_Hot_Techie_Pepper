2008-07-07T00:03:00.000Z	Pizarro2		Anyone to help with WINE please'
2008-07-07T00:03:00.000Z	pen	Pizarro2	what problem?
2008-07-07T00:04:00.000Z	Pizarro2	pen	I've just installed wine but nothing seems to happen when I try to run a win app
2008-07-07T00:04:00.000Z	pen	Pizarro2	how do you run win app with wine?
2008-07-07T00:04:00.000Z	Pizarro2	pen	I right click over it and select wun with wine
2008-07-07T00:05:00.000Z	pen	Pizarro2	try to run it in terminal
2008-07-07T00:05:00.000Z	pen	Pizarro2	like "wine app" (without the quote)
2008-07-07T00:05:00.000Z	Pizarro2	pen	but the exe is in my win partition, is that all right?
2008-07-07T00:05:00.000Z	pen	Pizarro2	if you mount the partition off course
2008-07-07T00:06:00.000Z	Pizarro2	pen	it's already mounted
2008-07-07T00:14:00.000Z	pen	Pizarro2	WebcamWonder is not saying the right thing
2008-07-07T00:15:00.000Z	Pizarro2	pen	WebcamWonder, What I want to know is how wine does know where are the DLLs that a certain win app needs?
2008-07-07T00:16:00.000Z	pen	Pizarro2	oh, actually if you look into your home folder, show hidden files you can find a folder named .wine
2008-07-07T00:16:00.000Z	pen	Pizarro2	that's where wine store almost all the dlls you can find in a normal win installation
2008-07-07T00:17:00.000Z	pen	Pizarro2	and most likely the apps you install with wine will be there too
2008-07-07T00:17:00.000Z	pen	Pizarro2	yes, /join #winehq
2008-07-07T00:17:00.000Z	Pizarro2	pen	ok, now: If I'm trying to run an app that needs aditional DLLs, ..Where do I have to put them?
