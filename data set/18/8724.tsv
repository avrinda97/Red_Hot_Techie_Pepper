2007-11-04T02:48:00.000Z	leo_rockw	tortho	hahaha. well, i only had beryl for like 10 min (then i grew tired) same thing w/ compiz fusion
2007-11-04T02:37:00.000Z	leo_rockw	tortho	why are you using xgl?
2007-11-04T02:38:00.000Z	tortho	leo_rockw	? I don't know.. Ubuntus decision..
2007-11-04T02:38:00.000Z	leo_rockw	tortho	you don't need xgl
2007-11-04T02:38:00.000Z	leo_rockw	tortho	xgl was used for ATI + compiz
2007-11-04T02:39:00.000Z	leo_rockw	tortho	since the new ati drivers come w/ aiglx, xgl is not needed anymore
2007-11-04T02:39:00.000Z	tortho	leo_rockw	 how can I then get rid of it?
2007-11-04T02:39:00.000Z	leo_rockw	tortho	sudo apt-get remove xserver-xgl
2007-11-04T02:39:00.000Z	leo_rockw	tortho	but your current session may stop working
2007-11-04T02:40:00.000Z	leo_rockw	tortho	you need to create a new one that doesn't use xgl
2007-11-04T02:41:00.000Z	tortho	leo_rockw	I'll give it a try :-) Any hint on creating a new one?
2007-11-04T02:41:00.000Z	leo_rockw	tortho	yeah, Pici is right, gutsy's fglrx drivers do not support AIGLX
2007-11-04T02:43:00.000Z	leo_rockw	tortho	if you're not going to use compiz at all, you won't need xgl anyway (or ati's new drivers)
2007-11-04T02:45:00.000Z	tortho	leo_rockw	the only reasn for having compiz would be tho show the cube to Vista users... It is just too much trouble and fault in it at the moment.. I used beryl befor and that worked more or less 99%... Compiz mabe 50%.... So I stick with something stable instead..
2007-11-04T02:46:00.000Z	leo_rockw	tortho	compiz fusion IS beryl + compiz
2007-11-04T02:47:00.000Z	tortho	leo_rockw	I know, but it does not look like it... my setup of it in feisty did work.. gutsy upgrade is not.. (not properlly)
2007-11-04T02:48:00.000Z	tortho	leo_rockw	Last christmas I had nice snow falling on my desktop etc... but not this year :-)
2007-11-04T02:48:00.000Z	leo_rockw	tortho	so i'm not a 3d effects authority
