2004-12-15T17:28:00.000Z	flam		is there a simple way of editing which daemons to autostart with ubuntu(like portmap and inetd) or do I have to edit the init.d files manually?
2004-12-15T17:29:00.000Z	flam		i'll just have to search harder.
2004-12-15T17:31:00.000Z	flam		ah, ok.
2004-12-15T17:31:00.000Z	flam		then i'll let it stay.
2004-12-15T17:31:00.000Z	flam		thanks for your help
2004-12-15T17:33:00.000Z	flam		i can't understand why almost 500 mb of my memory i used..
2004-12-15T17:33:00.000Z	crimsun	flam	how much RAM do you have?
2004-12-15T17:34:00.000Z	crimsun	flam	then that's normal. Linux aggressively caches.
2004-12-15T17:35:00.000Z	crimsun	flam	free -m|grep '-'|awk -F' ' '{print $4}'
2004-12-15T17:36:00.000Z	crimsun	flam	that's how much reclaiming memory you have. 311 seems plenty.
2004-12-15T17:38:00.000Z	crimsun	flam	"kernelpackages?"
2004-12-15T17:40:00.000Z	crimsun	flam	"my" is key - you've compiled it specifically for your hardware. Imagine trying to do that for a wide expanse of hardware matrices
2004-12-15T17:41:00.000Z	flam	crimsun	yeah, i know. just an idea..
2004-12-15T17:42:00.000Z	flam	crimsun	would be nice tho if one could make an own kernel in expert-mode.
2004-12-15T17:42:00.000Z	crimsun	flam	I don't believe that belongs in the installer, however. After one completes the installation, that's a perfectly good choice to begin with.
2004-12-15T17:44:00.000Z	flam	crimsun	yeah :)
2004-12-15T17:46:00.000Z	crimsun	flam	use dmix.
2004-12-15T17:48:00.000Z	crimsun	flam	I've placed a simple config at http://www.trilug.org/~crimsun/asound.conf ; if you have additional questions, /join #alsa and we'll discuss it there.
