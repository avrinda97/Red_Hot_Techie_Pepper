2006-12-02T06:49:00.000Z	Thaimaishu		and then after that, it just goes black almost like a screensaver after like 20 mins of nothing.
2006-12-02T06:49:00.000Z	Thaimaishu		Doesn't even give me a GUI menu for setup. I haven't reached even that far yet.
2006-12-02T06:50:00.000Z	Thaimaishu		plus, i got a reply to my forums thread, they asked for more info, and i was gonna give, but forums broke on me.  I'm positive i used the right info and everything, just wont let me log in.
2006-12-02T06:50:00.000Z	Thaimaishu		So, would you happen to know what is wrong with my stuff?
2006-12-02T06:51:00.000Z	_garry	Thaimaishu	Is this happening while trying to install, or after you've installed?
2006-12-02T06:51:00.000Z	_garry	Thaimaishu	So you don't get to choose safe mode?
2006-12-02T07:17:00.000Z	_garry	Thaimaishu	yes, I'm here
2006-12-02T07:17:00.000Z	_garry	Thaimaishu	what didn't? My memory isn't so good these days :-)
2006-12-02T07:17:00.000Z	_garry	Thaimaishu	Oh, I remember, the black screen
2006-12-02T07:18:00.000Z	_garry	Thaimaishu	I agree, could be your graphics card
2006-12-02T07:19:00.000Z	_garry	Thaimaishu	worth a shot...
2006-12-02T07:19:00.000Z	_garry	Thaimaishu	I've read about some people having troubles with upgrading from Dapper to Edgy
