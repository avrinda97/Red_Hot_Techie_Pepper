2011-07-28T03:59:00.000Z	Troy^		for a 500gb drive how much of a partion should i set for ubuntu?
2011-07-28T04:00:00.000Z	italoxp	Troy^	it depends on your use, dude
2011-07-28T04:00:00.000Z	Troy^	italoxp	i have no idea just general use is there lots that take up space? i know apps and the install is fairly small would you say 80-100gb?
2011-07-28T04:01:00.000Z	italoxp	Troy^	I had an Ubuntu install for a while, and I never used more than 10Gb for apps
2011-07-28T04:02:00.000Z	Troy^	italoxp	alright ill go with a 60-80gb install then
2011-07-28T04:02:00.000Z	italoxp	Troy^	for Ubuntu itself, I wouldn't give more then 30Gb
2011-07-28T04:02:00.000Z	italoxp	Troy^	if you're gonna use only Ubuntu, put the rest on /home
2011-07-28T04:02:00.000Z	Troy^	italoxp	well im going to dual boot with windows 7
2011-07-28T04:03:00.000Z	italoxp	Troy^	if you're gonna use another OS, put it on another partition that can be read by boath
2011-07-28T04:03:00.000Z	italoxp	Troy^	so, it's quite the same setup here
2011-07-28T04:03:00.000Z	italoxp	Troy^	I have Ubuntu 11.04 and Win 7 running on dual boot
2011-07-28T04:03:00.000Z	Troy^	italoxp	yea well my second 500gb is full of data or i would use a whole seperate drive for different OS
2011-07-28T04:07:00.000Z	italoxp	Troy^	so... I don't know
2011-07-28T04:08:00.000Z	italoxp	Troy^	but I'm telling you, Ubuntu won't use too much disk space
2011-07-28T04:11:00.000Z	Troy^	italoxp	nothing wrong with either of them
2011-07-28T04:12:00.000Z	Troy^	italoxp	most people who are use to mirc on windows will generally go to xchat in linux do to it having its own window interface
2011-07-28T06:07:00.000Z	italoxp	Troy^	I use both
2011-07-28T06:07:00.000Z	italoxp	Troy^	actually, I use Chrome, Firefox and Midori at the same time
