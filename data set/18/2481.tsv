2010-05-14T08:11:00.000Z	jabirali	test34	gnome/kde?
2010-05-14T08:11:00.000Z	test34	jabirali	#ubuntu, so gnome
2010-05-14T08:12:00.000Z	jabirali	test34	aha I didn't realize there was a #kubuntu, lol :P
2010-05-14T08:13:00.000Z	test34	jabirali	there might also be a #lubuntu but I havent tried it;)
2010-05-14T08:15:00.000Z	test34	jabirali	I disabled visual effects and it disabled transparency...
2010-05-14T08:17:00.000Z	jabirali	test34	hehe, I agree :P
2010-05-14T08:17:00.000Z	jabirali	test34	never really used compiz myself either :P
2010-05-14T08:18:00.000Z	jabirali	test34	if you don't like what you see, you should install "blast"
2010-05-14T08:18:00.000Z	test34	jabirali	I'll give it a try
2010-05-14T08:18:00.000Z	jabirali	test34	an application that makes permanent holes in graphical applications - no restrictions on what apps you can blast to pieces
2010-05-14T08:18:00.000Z	test34	jabirali	haha
2010-05-14T08:21:00.000Z	test34	jabirali	they need to find a way to make transparency more useful or get rid of it...
2010-05-14T08:27:00.000Z	jabirali	test34	I never transferred them automatically, but in case you forgot any you could at least go to Preferences-dialog -> Security -> Saved Passwords -> Show Passwords ;)
2010-05-14T08:27:00.000Z	jabirali	test34	that gives you website/username/password-combinations for all saved passwords
2010-05-14T08:28:00.000Z	test34	jabirali	yeah, I thought about that but I'm too lazy... Chrome should be able to import them;)
2010-05-14T08:28:00.000Z	jabirali	test34	hehe ;)
