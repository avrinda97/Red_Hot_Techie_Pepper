2008-08-26T12:52:00.000Z	gregge		is the next ubuntu out in october?
2008-08-26T12:52:00.000Z	chubs	gregge	that's the schedule
2008-08-26T12:56:00.000Z	gregge	chubs	Should be noted i bought a new laptop that hates linux, maybe that has affected my opinion
2008-08-26T12:56:00.000Z	chubs	gregge	what flavor?
2008-08-26T12:57:00.000Z	gregge	chubs	HP dv6800. No support at all for linux. Hardly any for XP even.
2008-08-26T12:57:00.000Z	chubs	gregge	like wireless/touchpad unsupported or is it worse?
2008-08-26T13:00:00.000Z	gregge	chubs	No, but the "mediacenter"-stuff doesn't and the mic won't work for people, and for some reason it seems way too slow, which it doesn't in XP... Is probably possible to fix, but I'm not sure what to do anymore!
2008-08-26T13:01:00.000Z	chubs	gregge	there's something odd going on if it's slower in linux than in windows, or do you mean for things like games and video?
2008-08-26T13:03:00.000Z	gregge	chubs	Browsing heavier webpages can be really slow. Games are OK actually. This is how it worked with a fresh install, and I haven't come around to fix much
2008-08-26T13:05:00.000Z	gregge	chubs	lots of people complain about HP though. I just didn't think there'd be any particular issues so I didn't hesitate on buying what seemed like a nice laptop.
2008-08-26T13:06:00.000Z	chubs	gregge	well it's odd if browsing heavier webpages is slower in linux, because that would somehow mean ram is being used inefficiently
2008-08-26T13:06:00.000Z	chubs	gregge	how much ram does your laptop have?
2008-08-26T13:06:00.000Z	gregge	chubs	2GB
2008-08-26T13:07:00.000Z	chubs	gregge	are you using desktop effects?
2008-08-26T13:07:00.000Z	gregge	chubs	no
2008-08-26T13:08:00.000Z	gregge	chubs	Games work ALMOST as well as in XP
2008-08-26T13:09:00.000Z	chubs	gregge	you're using nvidia, not ati, so no worries
2008-08-26T13:10:00.000Z	gregge	chubs	haha.. I don't know what I was thinking there =) I'm well aware it's Nvidia, probably just tired :)
