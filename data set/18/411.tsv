2012-03-01T19:45:00.000Z	vicium		Hi. whats the mode to gzip a entire folder? i tried gzip folder -f to force but did not work
2012-03-01T19:45:00.000Z	vicium		command* even if so
2012-03-01T19:47:00.000Z	vicium		$ tar xvcd minecraft.tar.gz minecraft
2012-03-01T19:47:00.000Z	vicium		tar: You may not specify more than one `-Acdtrux' or `--test-label' option

2012-03-01T19:47:00.000Z	vicium		i assume i am missing a - or something
2012-03-01T19:48:00.000Z	vicium		thanks!
2012-03-01T19:49:00.000Z	vicium		Also, very off-topic if its okay to ask here. But, windows emulation for games havent improved insanely since about 10 years ago no? Still tricky and messy?
2012-03-01T19:49:00.000Z	vicium		Or applications in general*
2012-03-01T19:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vicium	depends on the game
2012-03-01T19:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vicium	Separate partitions is fine, you can multiboot of a single drive if you wish
2012-03-01T19:56:00.000Z	vicium	ActionParsnip	Assuming I have the hardware for it. Is there any way to dual boot operative systems and toggle between them? :P
2012-03-01T19:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vicium	virtualbox alllows you to boot true installed OSes but I've heard of data corruption. You will not be able to game wel in virtualbox
2012-03-01T19:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vicium	sure, why not :)
2012-03-01T19:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vicium	depends on your hardware
2012-03-01T20:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vicium	virtualbox installs to a file, like wubi
2012-03-01T20:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vicium	it'll run ok :)
2012-03-01T20:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	vicium	wubi just gives a dual boot but it installs to a file which is loop mounted at boot, you will still need to reboot to switch OS
