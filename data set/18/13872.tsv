2005-10-07T08:38:00.000Z	christian-		Oh, and it's the same with -fs -fstype fullscreen
2005-10-07T08:40:00.000Z	christian-		what is the command to fullscreen mplayer ? -fs merely fullscreens the window, not the video output. Can it even be done? I
2005-10-07T08:41:00.000Z	christian-		've installed w32codecs and everything seems to be in working order, except that I can only run mplayer via the terminal
2005-10-07T08:41:00.000Z	christian-		That's super!
2005-10-07T08:42:00.000Z	holycow	christian-	you can create a launcher
2005-10-07T08:42:00.000Z	holycow	christian-	presto chango
2005-10-07T08:43:00.000Z	holycow	christian-	actually the reason for 'not being able to do the simpel tasks'
2005-10-07T08:43:00.000Z	holycow	christian-	is because you were taught bad bad bad habits on windows
2005-10-07T08:51:00.000Z	holycow	christian-	thats because default totem is totem-gstreamer
2005-10-07T08:44:00.000Z	holycow	christian-	the reason you cannot is because you are now running a true multiuser system with proper security setup, or rather at least it is assumed that you must not run as 'admin'
2005-10-07T08:50:00.000Z	holycow	christian-	heh, i haveto occasionally run totem from cli when playing dvds with weird encryption issues so i can kill it safely too
2005-10-07T08:50:00.000Z	christian-	holycow	I'd use totem - but it does not seem to have registred my downloaded/installed codecs
2005-10-07T08:52:00.000Z	holycow	christian-	also switch to totem-xine and install w32codecs ... if totem has an issue you can always run vlc or vice versa
2005-10-07T08:53:00.000Z	holycow	christian-	no need to compile mplayer, follow the totem xine instructions, you can finish it in like 3 minutes
2005-10-07T08:59:00.000Z	holycow	christian-	remember, you are learning a whole new os, don't expect to learn something like that in 2 days what took 15 years with the other guys
2005-10-07T08:59:00.000Z	holycow	christian-	welcome btw
2005-10-07T09:00:00.000Z	christian-	holycow	hehe, thank you. I've always had windows on my stationary computer, but then last year I got a macintosh and ended up really fed up with windows
