2007-11-30T21:01:00.000Z	Pici	brandon	if you navigate to the cd on the command line and type `ls -l` do the files you expect to be there exist?
2007-11-30T21:02:00.000Z	Pici	brandon	No what? Please address who you are talking to.
2007-11-30T21:03:00.000Z	Pici	brandon	what about from the dvd directory: find . -iname "*.exe"
2007-11-30T21:04:00.000Z	Pici	brandon	Does this work in any other computers properly?
2007-11-30T21:05:00.000Z	Pici	brandon	can you navigate to other folders on the DVD? do you have problems with any other data dvds?
