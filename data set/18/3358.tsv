2009-11-21T10:11:00.000Z	Dallas1		I've got the installer for 8.04.3 running on my netbook through flash-drive, and I'm at the part where it asks you to install cd-rom drivers to complete the installation, how would I direct it to install from the usb drive instead of the cd-rom(which doesn't exist)
2009-11-21T10:12:00.000Z	flan_suse	Dallas1	you need to copy a modified image on the USB stick.
2009-11-21T10:12:00.000Z	flan_suse	Dallas1	is it the alternate installer?
2009-11-21T10:13:00.000Z	flan_suse	Dallas1	I thought so.
2009-11-21T10:13:00.000Z	flan_suse	Dallas1	yeah, I had to go through the same thing. You need to get a copy of the modified image to throw onto the stick.
2009-11-21T10:15:00.000Z	flan_suse	Dallas1	one second. I think I have it in my bookmarks.
2009-11-21T10:37:00.000Z	flan_suse	Dallas1	it's for 8.04, Hardy, right?
2009-11-21T10:19:00.000Z	flan_suse	Dallas1	still looking.
2009-11-21T10:23:00.000Z	flan_suse	Dallas1	any reason not to try 9.10?
2009-11-21T10:26:00.000Z	flan_suse	Dallas1	can you write down the exact message it gives you?
2009-11-21T10:26:00.000Z	flan_suse	Dallas1	I can't find my bookmark, and I don't know the phrase to help find it.
2009-11-21T10:27:00.000Z	flan_suse	Dallas1	I have been through this before, and the solution worked, but I can't seem to find the link again.
2009-11-21T10:28:00.000Z	flan_suse	Dallas1	I mean the message you get when trying to install via a USB stick
2009-11-21T10:32:00.000Z	flan_suse	Dallas1	and you said Karmic doesn't support your video card?
2009-11-21T10:35:00.000Z	flan_suse	Dallas1	I never heard of that.
2009-11-21T10:36:00.000Z	flan_suse	Dallas1	I found it.
2009-11-21T10:38:00.000Z	flan_suse	Dallas1	http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/hardy/main/installer-i386/current/images/hd-media/
