2008-10-28T15:30:00.000Z	OxDeadC0de		so nobody knows how to at least disable gnomes nm-applet in kde sessions without uninstalling it?
2008-10-28T15:31:00.000Z	dr_willis	OxDeadC0de	 i noticed that gnome and kde's nm applets wehre both running for me under gnome.. so i closed kde's and told the gnome sessions  to not start it.. Perhaps kde's session manager tool has similer thing.
2008-10-31T17:41:00.000Z	dr_willis	OxDeadC0de	 sudo adduser guest    ?
2008-10-31T17:43:00.000Z	OxDeadC0de	dr_willis	should I then chmod u-w /home/guest ?
2008-10-31T17:43:00.000Z	dr_willis	OxDeadC0de	 why would you want to do that?
2008-10-31T17:44:00.000Z	dr_willis	OxDeadC0de	 why does it matter?  There are Koisk type extensions for firefox if you just want a 'web koisk' box.
2008-10-31T17:44:00.000Z	OxDeadC0de	dr_willis	I don't, I just want it to have a guest session as advertised for when I let people use my laptop ;)
2008-10-31T17:45:00.000Z	dr_willis	OxDeadC0de	 ive never seen a guest session advertised.. except on the live cds I just make a guest account for them to use on my installed systems
2008-10-31T17:46:00.000Z	dr_willis	OxDeadC0de	 oh wait.. i do see a Guest Session in the menus :) never noticed it befor
2008-10-31T17:46:00.000Z	OxDeadC0de	dr_willis	it was one of the main selling points of 8.10 (not to me but they tried to sell that feature a bunch)
2008-10-31T17:46:00.000Z	dr_willis	OxDeadC0de	 i dont recall it beingmentioned much at all..  I just saw guest session now in the menus of that user-applet - that ive rarely used
2008-10-31T17:47:00.000Z	dr_willis	OxDeadC0de	 i just tried it.. and it dident even work. :)
2008-10-31T17:50:00.000Z	OxDeadC0de	dr_willis	oh, I had to install gdm_guest_session package :)
2008-10-31T17:50:00.000Z	dr_willis	OxDeadC0de	 I got a guest session in the user applet, but on the gdm screen theres no mention of guest session.  the applet dosent work.. so not sure if it even works at all I recall some check box somewhere about it.
2008-10-31T17:51:00.000Z	dr_willis	OxDeadC0de	 heh - i just made a account namde 'guest' and leave a postit note on the pc saying.. Login: as guest, password guest. :)
2008-10-31T17:52:00.000Z	OxDeadC0de	dr_willis	now you can (somehow) let them log in without a password as guest and it will erase everything they did in that session when they log out ^^
2008-10-31T17:52:00.000Z	dr_willis	OxDeadC0de	 i dont see how from my gdm screen.. but my guest account may goof them up. :)
