2011-03-31T07:16:00.000Z	naomi_		Lol that's Scotland. Part of Britain.
2011-03-31T07:17:00.000Z	naomi_		Only some parts of NI are ruled by Britain.
2011-03-31T07:19:00.000Z	naomi_		I'm a Dubliner myself. :>
2011-03-31T07:21:00.000Z	naomi_		Aha.
2011-03-31T07:23:00.000Z	naomi_		Not all of NI is ruled by Britain. ._.
2011-03-31T07:23:00.000Z	mickster04	naomi_	NI = Northern Ireland
2011-03-31T07:24:00.000Z	mickster04	naomi_	well then, seeing as britain includes the uk and the uk includes NI then it makes sense that if you are from NI you are british :p
