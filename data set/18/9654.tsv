2007-03-15T06:50:00.000Z	Rooy	bayziders	that mean a bootable iso will make a bootable cd, just some program/cd recorder/disc combination didn't workout well
2007-03-15T06:51:00.000Z	Rooy	bayziders	there's way to check the burned disk's quality
2007-03-15T06:52:00.000Z	Rooy	bayziders	is there a program named md5sum on your mac?
2007-03-15T06:52:00.000Z	bayziders	Rooy	wouldent know it isnt powerful enough to run tiger so owhen ever i open a app it crashes
2007-03-15T06:53:00.000Z	Rooy	bayziders	can you open a terminal?
2007-03-15T06:53:00.000Z	Rooy	bayziders	is the a command "md5sum" there?
2007-03-15T06:55:00.000Z	bayziders	Rooy	the command is not found
2007-03-15T06:56:00.000Z	bayziders	Rooy	when i try to view the cd conetents on my pc it says it is right protected what does this mean?
2007-03-15T06:56:00.000Z	Rooy	bayziders	i use that to check the burned cd's quality when using linux
2007-03-15T06:57:00.000Z	Rooy	bayziders	another try, is there a command dmesg on mac?
2007-03-15T06:58:00.000Z	Rooy	bayziders	so i advise you to burn another disk, with lowest speed, and without other apps running
