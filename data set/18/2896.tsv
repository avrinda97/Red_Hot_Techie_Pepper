2012-08-30T13:51:00.000Z	opakavic		i'm missing totally, its not at all booting
2012-08-30T13:52:00.000Z	opakavic		The same cd is booting in my old p4 machine
2012-08-30T13:52:00.000Z	opakavic		ub is ubuntu, cfhowlett
2012-08-30T13:52:00.000Z	opakavic		i'm having 12.04 in cd
2012-08-30T13:54:00.000Z	nibbler_	opakavic	please be more verbose. is the boot menu of the cd showing, is the install running but sys does not boot later, is the install starting to boot but then hanging, can you enter boot options at any time?
2012-08-30T13:54:00.000Z	nibbler_	opakavic	i5 does not need support, its x86 so supported via this
2012-08-30T13:55:00.000Z	opakavic	nibbler_	its not booting at all
2012-08-30T13:55:00.000Z	opakavic	nibbler_	not even the boot screen i see
2012-08-30T13:56:00.000Z	nibbler_	opakavic	if you dont see anything, then your laptop is broken.
2012-08-30T13:56:00.000Z	opakavic	nibbler_	well i can able to boot OSX and windows in the same laptop
2012-08-30T13:57:00.000Z	opakavic	nibbler_	i have no idea about this..
2012-08-30T13:57:00.000Z	nibbler_	opakavic	then it is booting. what **exactly** happens when you insert the install-cd?
2012-08-30T13:58:00.000Z	opakavic	nibbler_	it shows me a screen with menus, then i select first option.. to install in my machine
2012-08-30T13:59:00.000Z	nibbler_	opakavic	so the bootloader shows, good. try to add these boot options: noapic nolapic acpi=off acpi=no   (sort of redundant, as i dont know the exact ones)
2012-08-30T13:59:00.000Z	nibbler_	opakavic	and remove anything that says "quiet" or "splash"
2012-08-30T13:59:00.000Z	nibbler_	opakavic	and add "nospash" just in case (sorry for multiline response)
2012-08-30T13:59:00.000Z	opakavic	nibbler_	okay.. thanks let me try and get back
