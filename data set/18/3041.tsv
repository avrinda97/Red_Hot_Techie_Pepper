2010-04-15T17:54:00.000Z	xfact		Hello
2010-04-15T17:54:00.000Z	xfact		I am back with heaps of new problems
2010-04-15T17:55:00.000Z	xfact		Last time after bot getting updates, somebody suggested me to format my machine again, and I did but I am again having the same issue
2010-04-15T17:55:00.000Z	xfact		I can't have any updates due to server IP error
2010-04-15T17:55:00.000Z	xfact		Any help?
2010-04-15T17:56:00.000Z	Pici	xfact	Can you pastebin the output from sudo apt-get update please?
2010-04-15T17:58:00.000Z	xfact	Pici	Here is it, http://paste.ubuntu.com/414940/
2010-04-15T17:59:00.000Z	Pici	xfact	Yes, it looks like a few people are reporting that today.  You can switch to a new server from System>Administration>Software sources.  Theres a button in there to choose the best server.
2010-04-15T18:00:00.000Z	xfact	Pici	Unfortunately this was the best server which is failing
2010-04-15T18:03:00.000Z	Pici	xfact	There are a few other mirrors for India. http://mirror.cse.iitk.ac.in/ubuntu/ and ftp://ftp.iitb.ac.in/distributions/ubuntu/archives/ look like they are up-to-date
2010-04-15T18:04:00.000Z	Pici	xfact	See https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+archivemirrors for a full list
2010-04-15T18:08:00.000Z	xfact	Pici	Feew! You saved my day, I was totally loosing my hope, seems like it's working anyway, thanks :D
2010-04-15T20:55:00.000Z	Pici	xfact	Can you rephrase that?
2010-04-15T20:57:00.000Z	xfact	Pici	sure: I am still having few 'package not found' issues, so can I hope that soon the "best" will again start working...?
2010-04-15T20:58:00.000Z	Pici	xfact	You'll need to modify your /etc/apt/sources.list file so that instead of it saying http://in.archive.ubuntu.com/ it says http://in.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/
2010-04-15T20:59:00.000Z	xfact	Pici	That server location is not located under 'India' servers, should I add it?
2010-04-15T21:00:00.000Z	Pici	xfact	Its the same server that you were using, but with a different path.
2010-04-29T22:50:00.000Z	Pici	xfact	yes!
