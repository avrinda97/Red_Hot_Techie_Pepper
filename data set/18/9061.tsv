2007-05-15T10:52:00.000Z	RAOF	LuisGMarine	*really* 2GB swap?
2007-05-15T10:52:00.000Z	LuisGMarine	RAOF	dunno that's what I put down ..., could be wrong
2007-05-15T10:54:00.000Z	RAOF	LuisGMarine	Yup, that's me.
2007-05-15T10:54:00.000Z	LuisGMarine	RAOF	sweet, thanks for doing that stuff :)
2007-05-15T10:54:00.000Z	RAOF	LuisGMarine	Self-interest triumphs again :)
2007-05-15T10:55:00.000Z	LuisGMarine	RAOF	lol
2007-05-15T10:55:00.000Z	LuisGMarine	RAOF	this subpixel update thing improve 32-bit apps too?
2007-05-15T10:56:00.000Z	RAOF	LuisGMarine	Well, yes.  But they need the 32bit packages :)
2007-05-15T10:57:00.000Z	LuisGMarine	RAOF	sound like fun, is there a howto on the forums?
2007-05-15T10:57:00.000Z	RAOF	LuisGMarine	Yes, in exactly the same spot.  The original packages were 32bit.
2007-05-15T10:57:00.000Z	LuisGMarine	RAOF	to get 32-bit apps from 64-bit fonts looking better that is ...
2007-05-15T10:57:00.000Z	RAOF	LuisGMarine	Oh, *that*.  Hm.  Personally, I wouldn't bother, as I just don't use 32bit apps.
2007-05-15T10:58:00.000Z	LuisGMarine	RAOF	meh well its firefox + flash + java, so its kinda like a must
2007-05-15T10:58:00.000Z	LuisGMarine	RAOF	I guess I can switch back and forth between 32 and 64-bit, only use 32-bit when I'm visiting flash and java based websites
2007-05-15T10:58:00.000Z	RAOF	LuisGMarine	Eh, I don't miss flash.  And the Gnu java pulgin works fine for my purposes :)
2007-05-15T11:01:00.000Z	RAOF	LuisGMarine	Well, actually, the only thing *wrong* with 64bit distros is evil, proprietary software :(
2007-05-15T11:01:00.000Z	LuisGMarine	RAOF	as in what?
