2010-09-29T22:07:00.000Z	magicianlord		how do you show the MAC address of your computer
2010-09-29T22:08:00.000Z	magicianlord		what mac address is our unique id that identifies the computer? or connection only
2010-09-29T22:08:00.000Z	magicianlord		yes?
2010-09-29T22:08:00.000Z	greppy	magicianlord	if you have multiple NICs you will have multiple MACs
2010-09-29T21:56:00.000Z	magicianlord	greppy	what is the equivalent of dvdshrink ?
2010-09-29T21:56:00.000Z	greppy	magicianlord	no idea.
2010-09-29T21:56:00.000Z	magicianlord	greppy	dats wut you need, dawg
2010-09-29T21:57:00.000Z	greppy	magicianlord	nope, dd works just fine, then I can stream the image over wifi to the PC plugged into my tv :)
2010-09-29T21:57:00.000Z	magicianlord	greppy	stream over wifi???? wowowowowow
2010-09-29T21:58:00.000Z	greppy	magicianlord	yup, works just fine :)
2010-09-29T22:07:00.000Z	greppy	magicianlord	ifconfig eth0
2010-09-29T22:08:00.000Z	greppy	magicianlord	ethernet port only
2010-09-29T22:10:00.000Z	greppy	magicianlord	the first 6 chars of the MAC address identify the manufacturer, I have seen some that have reused a MAC address on a device, that can be a pain.
2010-09-29T22:11:00.000Z	greppy	magicianlord	that's usually a local provider like a coffeeshop or hotel.
2010-09-29T22:12:00.000Z	greppy	magicianlord	your IP address will be used for that more than a MAC address, unless they go to your ISP or the coffeeshop you were using.
2010-09-29T22:16:00.000Z	greppy	magicianlord	depends on the hardware.  It is not always possible to change the MAC of a network card.
2010-09-29T22:16:00.000Z	greppy	magicianlord	why do you want to?
2010-10-04T01:33:00.000Z	magicianlord	greppy	not always.
