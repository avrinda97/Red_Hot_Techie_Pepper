2008-04-10T21:28:00.000Z	Damion		howdy?
2008-04-10T21:28:00.000Z	Damion		er
2008-04-10T21:28:00.000Z	Damion		minus the question mark.
2008-04-10T21:28:00.000Z	Damion		How's it going?
2008-04-10T21:29:00.000Z	Damion		so I tried to install xubuntu about a month back now and gave up because I couldn't burn a liveCD that worked, so I figured I'd wait for a ubuntu official release to come in the mail
2008-04-10T21:30:00.000Z	Damion		none of "start or install", "start in low graphics mode" and "CD test" work
2008-04-10T21:30:00.000Z	Damion		after the screen with the orange loading bar
2008-04-10T21:30:00.000Z	Damion		kk
2008-04-10T21:31:00.000Z	Damion		After the loading bar, it puts me in a program called BusyBox.
2008-04-10T21:31:00.000Z	Seveas	Damion	that could mean the cd is broken
2008-04-10T21:32:00.000Z	Seveas	Damion	then burn a new one (make sure the iso file is correct!)
2008-04-10T21:33:00.000Z	Seveas	Damion	are you sure you're looking at the right hash then?
2008-04-10T21:34:00.000Z	Seveas	Damion	disk and iso should have the same md5sum, otherwise the burn went wrong. Burn at a lower speed
2008-04-12T00:33:00.000Z	Seveas	Damion	hardware incompatibility. Is the machine as old as windows 98?
2008-04-12T00:35:00.000Z	Seveas	Damion	it gives a rough indication
2008-04-12T00:35:00.000Z	Seveas	Damion	odd, have you tried the CD selftest?
2008-04-12T00:37:00.000Z	Seveas	Damion	could be a broken CD drive then
2008-04-12T00:38:00.000Z	Seveas	Damion	busted IDE cable?
