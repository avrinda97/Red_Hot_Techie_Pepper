2009-10-07T12:42:00.000Z	mlissner		Hi, does anybody know anything about the security model of package installation? Like, is there any guarantee that the package you install is in fact the package from the source? /
2009-10-07T12:43:00.000Z	contrast	mlissner	Assuming your repositories are authenticated (all of the default ones are), yes, pretty much guaranteed.
2009-10-07T12:44:00.000Z	mlissner	contrast	Do you know how that works? Is it via me having the correct public key for each package source?
2009-10-07T12:44:00.000Z	contrast	mlissner	Correct.
2009-10-07T12:45:00.000Z	mlissner	contrast	Do you know if there is anything different about the sources that are security.mirror.whatever vs the mirror.whatever sources?
2009-10-07T12:47:00.000Z	contrast	mlissner	Not too sure, honestly. Different how?
2009-10-07T12:48:00.000Z	mlissner	contrast	Not sure. I just noticed a while back there was some differentiation about those when looking in /etc/apt/sources.list
2009-10-07T12:49:00.000Z	contrast	mlissner	From my [limited] understanding, the security repo is strictly for package updates which fix security holes. Not sure if that answers your question.
2009-10-07T12:50:00.000Z	mlissner	contrast	yeah, that helps.
2009-10-07T12:50:00.000Z	mlissner	contrast	In any case, it seems like packages should be good and secure. So that's good.
2009-10-07T12:50:00.000Z	contrast	mlissner	Any certain reason you're asking, or just curious?
2009-10-07T12:51:00.000Z	contrast	mlissner	Yup. :)
2009-10-07T12:51:00.000Z	mlissner	contrast	research for HW. I'm looking for holes in the PGP. Can't find any useful ones in the package itself, so I'm fishing for holes in the obtaining the package.
2009-10-07T12:52:00.000Z	mlissner	contrast	Oops, the above should have been directed to you...
2009-10-07T12:52:00.000Z	contrast	mlissner	I do remember reading an article about a repo of another major distro being compromised a while back, but stuff like that is usually due to sysadmin's not doing their job. : \
2009-10-07T12:53:00.000Z	mlissner	contrast	yeah, seems like a dead end.
2009-10-07T12:53:00.000Z	contrast	mlissner	So obviously, if a repo is compromised, the packages can be authenticated with a 230957203972-bit key and it won't matter.
2009-10-07T12:54:00.000Z	mlissner	contrast	indeed.
