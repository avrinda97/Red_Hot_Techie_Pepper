2010-11-13T09:54:00.000Z	Gary_B		so im in the linux mint setup
2010-11-13T09:55:00.000Z	Gary_B		and able to connect to the lan and browse the net, very unlike winxp ;-)
2010-11-13T09:56:00.000Z	Gary_B		i resized my windows partition to leave 50GB free, but the auto setup seems to want to overrwite my windows rather than partition up the free space?
2010-11-13T09:57:00.000Z	yagoo	Gary_B	lower button on that setup page
2010-11-13T09:57:00.000Z	yagoo	Gary_B	choose advanced/custom part when the partition choice comes
2010-11-13T09:58:00.000Z	Gary_B	yagoo	done, do i need to setup seperate swap file, main partitions for linux?
2010-11-13T09:58:00.000Z	yagoo	Gary_B	yeah.. u need 1 swap partition and 1 partition for "/".. you just need two partition for linux
2010-11-13T09:59:00.000Z	yagoo	Gary_B	how much ram do you have?
2010-11-13T09:59:00.000Z	Gary_B	yagoo	2GB swap will be 2x the size of my ram yea?
2010-11-13T10:00:00.000Z	yagoo	Gary_B	that's good
2010-11-13T10:00:00.000Z	yagoo	Gary_B	2048 Megs is good
2010-11-13T10:00:00.000Z	Gary_B	yagoo	are they logical or primary partitions, note i have a windows partition already?
2010-11-13T10:01:00.000Z	yagoo	Gary_B	how many partition you want to make?
2010-11-13T10:02:00.000Z	yagoo	Gary_B	you can have 3 partitions-- 1 for win, 1 for "/", 1 for swap.. they would be all primary.
2010-11-13T10:02:00.000Z	Gary_B	yagoo	great, thanks, since win partition is already first, does it make a diff if my swap is in the middle or the end of the disk
2010-11-13T10:03:00.000Z	yagoo	Gary_B	"/" can be ext4.
2010-11-13T10:03:00.000Z	yagoo	Gary_B	either way.. linux is very flexible..
2010-11-13T10:06:00.000Z	Gary_B	yagoo	swap is neither mounted nor formatted yea?
