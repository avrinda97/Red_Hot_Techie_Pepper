2009-12-02T01:00:00.000Z	cj_		Hi I'm a newbie...I have a E-MU 1212m sound card.  I can't understand how to understand on how to install the driver.
2009-12-02T01:00:00.000Z	sebsebseb	cj_	oh
2009-12-02T01:00:00.000Z	sebsebseb	cj_	how new to Ubuntu or Linux in general even?
2009-12-02T01:01:00.000Z	sebsebseb	cj_	sound isn't really my area, but maybe I can hep you a little bit
2009-12-02T01:01:00.000Z	cj_	sebsebseb	 extremely new
2009-12-02T01:01:00.000Z	sebsebseb	cj_	how new?  and which versin of Ubuntu?
2009-12-02T01:03:00.000Z	sebsebseb	cj_	9.10 yes?
2009-12-02T01:03:00.000Z	cj_	sebsebseb	yes
2009-12-02T01:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	cj_	sound is hmm
2009-12-02T01:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	cj_	your on a lap top?
2009-12-02T01:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	cj_	and sound does not work at all?
2009-12-02T01:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	cj_	ok well  that's a bit odd for a desktop
2009-12-02T01:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	cj_	it's lap tops that usually get the sound issues with Ubuntu
2009-12-02T01:06:00.000Z	sebsebseb	cj_	however I had a proper sound issue on my desktop for the first time with 9.10
2009-12-02T01:07:00.000Z	sebsebseb	cj_	you may be able to configure stuff and get your sound working, but it won't be that easy, especially when your new
2009-12-02T01:07:00.000Z	sebsebseb	cj_	what kind of sound hardware is it? nothing that fancy, or really new right?
2009-12-02T01:09:00.000Z	sebsebseb	cj_	don't know the answer?  or disappeard on me?
2009-12-02T01:11:00.000Z	sebsebseb	cj_	9.10  has issues with certain things that worked in the previous release 9.04, so maybe you should try that
