2005-11-05T07:12:00.000Z	bimberi	odat	good question, i don't know sorry
2005-11-05T07:25:00.000Z	bimberi	odat	"resume download? YES - as long as you save file to same location as the existing download" ( http://biology.fresno.edu/thomp/computing/bittorrent.html )
2006-01-18T11:40:00.000Z	bimberi	odat	you can use debfoster, also the aptitude package manager is better at uninstalling obsolete dependencies
2006-01-18T11:44:00.000Z	bimberi	odat	1. no idea, don't use it, seen it recommended quite a bit though 2. because the author hasn't done so

2006-04-01T09:34:00.000Z	bimberi	odat	they are probably still in a .Trash directory, probably in roots home directory (/root)
2006-04-01T09:35:00.000Z	odat	bimberi	the root has its own trash?
2006-04-01T09:35:00.000Z	bimberi	odat	if you logged in as root and deleted files in nautilus it will - or did you run nautilus with (gk)sudo from your user account?
2006-04-01T09:36:00.000Z	odat	bimberi	i used the run as different user tool and ran nautilus as root    it ask for my sudo password
2006-04-01T09:37:00.000Z	bimberi	odat	ah, then the files might be in your own .Trash.  Have you tried emptying the Trash? (right-clicking on its icon at bottom right of screen)
2006-04-01T09:38:00.000Z	odat	bimberi	i just found them in my .trash directory under root
2006-04-01T09:38:00.000Z	odat	bimberi	how do i delete them from there?
2006-04-01T09:39:00.000Z	bimberi	odat	using 'sudo rm' from a terminal
2006-04-01T09:39:00.000Z	bimberi	odat	ah kk
