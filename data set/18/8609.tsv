2007-09-14T12:48:00.000Z	faileas	abhibera	nvidia is 2 clicks to install drivers pretty much
2007-09-14T12:49:00.000Z	abhibera	faileas	is there any point in saving a couple of hundred dollars and going in for the Dell Vostro 1000?
2007-09-14T12:49:00.000Z	abhibera	faileas	it has an AMD Athlon X2 and ATI 256 X1150

2007-09-14T12:50:00.000Z	abhibera	faileas	ibm is freakin expensive here. so i have to opt for a dell. it's cheaper for u guys in US
2007-09-14T12:58:00.000Z	abhibera	faileas	it's cheaper there too
2007-09-14T12:59:00.000Z	faileas	abhibera	one thing i'd be concerned about with is wifi
2007-09-14T13:00:00.000Z	abhibera	faileas	why?
2007-09-14T13:00:00.000Z	abhibera	faileas	the dell cards are supported. u gotta dig a well to get them working
2007-09-14T13:01:00.000Z	faileas	abhibera	cause drivers for that on linux arn't always too easy to get working, even when they have FOSS drivers
