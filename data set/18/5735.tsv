2008-08-30T22:23:00.000Z	Cpudan80	chrisdown	can you boot of an XP CD into the recovery console?
2008-08-30T22:24:00.000Z	Cpudan80	chrisdown	that *should* have chkdsk
2008-08-30T22:24:00.000Z	chrisdown	Cpudan80	- yes, but it doesn't recognise my disk.
2008-08-30T22:24:00.000Z	chrisdown	Cpudan80	- what do i tell it to format?
2008-08-30T22:24:00.000Z	chrisdown		*chkdsk
2008-08-30T22:24:00.000Z	chrisdown	Cpudan80	- what drive letter? i've tried all of them
2008-08-30T22:24:00.000Z	Cpudan80	chrisdown	perhaps you should join ##windows
2008-08-30T22:24:00.000Z	Cpudan80	chrisdown	it's not really an ubuntu problem
2008-08-30T22:25:00.000Z	Cpudan80	chrisdown	I'm over there too
2008-08-30T22:25:00.000Z	chrisdown	Cpudan80	- this is a linux problem, not a windows problem, surely. i am asking how to reset my drives in ubuntu
2008-08-30T22:25:00.000Z	Cpudan80		what do you mean reset them?
2008-08-30T22:25:00.000Z	Cpudan80		you want to get rid of ubuntu and isntall windows chrisdown ?
2008-08-30T22:26:00.000Z	chrisdown	Cpudan80	bazhang - yes, and yes.
2008-08-30T22:26:00.000Z	chrisdown	Cpudan80	bazhang - i swear it's purely because wine doesn't run my games and VB ain't working :P
2008-08-30T22:26:00.000Z	chrisdown		ok.,
2008-08-30T22:26:00.000Z	Cpudan80	chrisdown	So just run the XP installation off the XP disk -- it will trash Ubuntu
2008-08-30T22:26:00.000Z	Cpudan80		At least you're installing XP and not Vista
2008-08-30T22:26:00.000Z	chrisdown	Cpudan80	- as i said before, i get a STOP error. i need to CHKDSK /R
