2005-05-04T13:59:00.000Z	ompaul	djm62	what is the value of a micropayment?
2005-05-04T14:00:00.000Z	djm62	ompaul	Edgan: at no point have I suggested that I "couldn't" do it...just that it would be expensive to make it as easy as phoning
2005-05-04T14:00:00.000Z	ompaul	djm62	well I take calls on a land line but I make a lot of calls on skype
2005-06-28T16:14:00.000Z	ompaul	djm62	yeap, thanks I was off playing editor with thata
2005-06-28T16:15:00.000Z	djm62	ompaul	say what?!?
2005-06-28T16:24:00.000Z	ompaul	djm62	I was editing some of the config stuff in firefox when you gave the the about:config clue :)
2005-06-28T16:32:00.000Z	djm62	ompaul	mono is an open version...more free than java for instance
2005-06-28T16:32:00.000Z	ompaul	djm62	this I know :)
2005-06-28T13:14:00.000Z	ompaul	djm62	ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
2005-06-28T13:17:00.000Z	ompaul	djm62	the other network has a windows gateway
2005-07-04T14:43:00.000Z	ompaul	djm62	no I know knoppix did it :)
2005-09-19T11:12:00.000Z	djm62	ompaul	is it loading the same module as hoary?
2005-09-19T11:12:00.000Z	ompaul	djm62	I think, if memory serves me correctly it wants to
2005-09-19T11:13:00.000Z	ompaul	djm62	I remember doing some modprobing to get it going to start in the first case but nothing too mad
2005-09-19T11:14:00.000Z	ompaul	djm62	 now it auto detected but the module orinoco_cs is doing something wrong - cos it sure as *** is not loading
2005-09-19T11:14:00.000Z	djm62	ompaul	check the options you can pass to the module
2005-09-19T11:15:00.000Z	ompaul	djm62	as spock says that would be logical :)
