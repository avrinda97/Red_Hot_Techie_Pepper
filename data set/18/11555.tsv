2006-07-14T05:53:00.000Z	Dimensions		thanks Mastastealth  i already have a swap and linux partition so which one i will be over writing ? ... and what abt the internet which works smoothly on RH is it going to work and installed there too ?
2006-07-14T05:54:00.000Z	Dimensions		thanks AndyCooll_
2006-07-14T05:57:00.000Z	AndyCooll_	Dimensions	When in RH, use the command line and type df. That should tell you what partition is being used for what
2006-07-14T05:58:00.000Z	AndyCooll_	Dimensions	When you come to install Ubuntu make sure you select the RH partition to overwrite
2006-07-14T05:59:00.000Z	AndyCooll_	Dimensions	Usually Windows is on the first partition
2006-07-14T06:02:00.000Z	Dimensions	AndyCooll_	 ... and is my internet going to be configured the same way as it did in RH ?
2006-07-14T06:03:00.000Z	AndyCooll_	Dimensions	Anything special about your Internet connection, wireless? If it's bog-standard ethernet connection then It should find it yes.
2006-07-14T06:04:00.000Z	Dimensions		nah its ethernet .. connection
2006-07-14T06:07:00.000Z	Dimensions	AndyCooll_	before i go for installation ... i have a few questions to ask ... first .. we have a software which we install on client pcs we were using MS os till now we migrated to linux .. we want our software to run automatically each time ubuntu starts ... how we do it .. ?
2006-07-14T06:08:00.000Z	AndyCooll_	Dimensions	Is this software Linux compatible?
2006-07-14T06:09:00.000Z	Dimensions		AndyColl_: yes it is ... it is running smoothly ... is there any programme like startup in MS based so we add it and it runs always ?
2006-07-14T06:09:00.000Z	AndyCooll_	Dimensions	By default, MS software doesn't run on Linux, not without the help of Wine or such "emulators"
2006-07-14T06:10:00.000Z	AndyCooll_	Dimensions	System-->Preferences-->Sessions
2006-07-14T06:10:00.000Z	AndyCooll_		You can add stuff to the startup process there
2006-07-14T06:11:00.000Z	Dimensions	AndyCooll_	does it support all executable files ?
2006-07-14T06:13:00.000Z	AndyCooll_	Dimensions	Sorry, can't answer that. I think so, but II wouldn't like to say that is a definitive answer
