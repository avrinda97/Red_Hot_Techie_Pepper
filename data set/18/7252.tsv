2009-03-15T16:53:00.000Z	Cheery		hi, I'd need to find out 32bit version of libgtk-1.2.so.0 for my 64bit machine, anyone knows where to get that from?
2009-03-15T16:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cheery	you need a 32bit version of libgtk1.2
2009-03-15T16:55:00.000Z	Cheery	ActionParsnip	how to get that?
2009-03-15T16:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cheery	head to the packages site on ubuntu and manually download the package then install it
2009-03-15T16:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cheery	this may break your system, so its your own risk
2012-05-03T09:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cheery	have you reported a bug?
2012-05-03T09:51:00.000Z	Cheery	ActionParsnip	I haven't.
2012-05-03T09:52:00.000Z	Cheery	ActionParsnip	where to do so?
2012-05-03T09:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cheery	then how do the devs know there is an issue?
2012-05-03T09:53:00.000Z	Cheery	ActionParsnip	probably in no way. except is an outdated package a bug?
2012-05-03T09:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cheery	report a bug and it may get updated
2012-05-03T09:55:00.000Z	Cheery	ActionParsnip	thanks. I'll do so.
2012-05-03T09:59:00.000Z	Cheery	ActionParsnip	just enough to not include the -P :)
2012-05-03T10:00:00.000Z	Cheery	ActionParsnip	you think I could compile my own package which would replace this one?
2012-05-03T10:00:00.000Z	Cheery	ActionParsnip	or find precompiled one somewhere
2012-05-03T10:00:00.000Z	Cheery	ActionParsnip	it avoids me writing one script so it'd be nice.
2012-05-03T10:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Cheery	no reason why not, i suggest you run:  ubuntu-bug util-linux   and report the issues
2012-05-03T10:02:00.000Z	Cheery	ActionParsnip	thank you
