2007-08-06T11:36:00.000Z	CheeseGardener		Ok
2007-08-06T11:36:00.000Z	CheeseGardener		I'll do that then.
2007-08-06T11:37:00.000Z	CheeseGardener		Lately, all I use windows for is to defragment.
2007-08-06T11:37:00.000Z	CheeseGardener		are there any serious problems with VMware or Quem when defragmenting?
2007-08-06T11:37:00.000Z	CheeseGardener		where the HDD could break?
2007-08-06T11:39:00.000Z	CheeseGardener		Oh.... so I could lose everything then?
2007-08-06T11:40:00.000Z	CheeseGardener		so is there any safe way to defrag a NTFS drive without windows?
2007-08-06T11:40:00.000Z	CheeseGardener		darn
2007-08-06T11:41:00.000Z	CheeseGardener		so should I just format my drive to EXT3?
2007-08-06T11:41:00.000Z	CheeseGardener		if I do that I can't hook it to computers that don't have EXT3 on them
2007-08-06T11:41:00.000Z	AWOSLappy	CheeseGardener	yep
2007-08-06T11:41:00.000Z	AWOSLappy	CheeseGardener	wait, this is an external drive?
2007-08-06T11:41:00.000Z	AWOSLappy	CheeseGardener	there are Win32 ext3 drivers that I use day-to-day.
2007-08-06T11:42:00.000Z	AWOSLappy	CheeseGardener	sure.
2007-08-06T11:42:00.000Z	AWOSLappy	CheeseGardener	VMware allows you to run Windows inside Linux.
2007-08-06T11:43:00.000Z	AWOSLappy	CheeseGardener	Yep.  And it's free.
2007-08-06T11:43:00.000Z	AWOSLappy	CheeseGardener	you CAN'T use it with vista (unless you have uber-enterprise-expensive edition), but you can with all others.
2007-08-06T11:44:00.000Z	AWOSLappy	CheeseGardener	no...you have to have a valid, legal copy of Windows
