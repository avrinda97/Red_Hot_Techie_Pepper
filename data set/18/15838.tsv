2005-01-20T17:33:00.000Z	SirFred		I've opened a bug with that (5339)
2005-01-20T17:34:00.000Z	SirFred		It's seems a HAL problem.
2005-01-20T17:34:00.000Z	SirFred		And I found this message:
2005-01-20T17:35:00.000Z	SirFred		15:49:08.544 [W]  hald_dbus.c:97: No property volume.policy.desired_mount_point on device with id /org/freedesktop/Hal/devices/block_Criminal y Decen
2005-01-20T17:35:00.000Z	SirFred		Perhaps this has no relation, and it's only a warning.

2005-01-20T17:38:00.000Z	daniels	SirFred	you need to be in the plugdev group
2005-01-20T17:38:00.000Z	SirFred	daniels	Perhaps the problem is that I upgraded from Hoary.
2005-01-20T17:39:00.000Z	SirFred	daniels	And so, I'm not on the right groups.
2005-02-16T06:55:00.000Z	daniels	SirFred	what you copy with edit->copy is pasteable via edit->paste
2005-02-16T06:55:00.000Z	SirFred	daniels	So, when I select something with the mouse, it's not available with edit->paste ?
2005-02-16T06:55:00.000Z	daniels	SirFred	no
2005-02-16T06:56:00.000Z	daniels	SirFred	arguably, yes
2005-02-16T06:57:00.000Z	daniels	SirFred	not really; the status quo is that if you copy/paste via one method (mouse selection + mmb, or edit->copy/edit->paste), you'll get consistency
