2005-06-14T11:12:00.000Z	jahor		pls i have one little problem with my ubuntu with dependancy... i installed kismet from deb sid (because ubuntu's is old version) with --force-depends but now, i could not use dist-upgrade... it asks for fixing glibc dependancy or to install ubuntu's old veriosn of kismet... is there a clear sollution to this (pinning or so...)
2005-06-14T11:12:00.000Z	bob2	jahor	er, remove it
2005-06-14T11:12:00.000Z	bob2	jahor	and install the ubuntu one
2005-06-14T11:13:00.000Z	bob2	jahor	and don't do that again
2005-06-14T11:13:00.000Z	bob2	jahor	--force-depends will utterly screw apt, do not do it if you expect to use apt or aptitude or synaptic again
2005-06-14T11:13:00.000Z	bob2	jahor	if you want the newer version, build the sid source package on ubuntu
2005-06-14T11:14:00.000Z	jahor	bob2	i have already source here and i'm prepared to rebuild this package... i want to fix this just for "i know for tommotow)
2005-06-14T11:14:00.000Z	bob2	jahor	apt won't work until you get rid of it
2005-06-14T11:15:00.000Z	jahor	bob2	the only problem with sid's package is that it depends on "ds" suffixed but the same version of glibc
2005-06-14T11:15:00.000Z	bob2	jahor	yes, indeed, which will a) possibly break kismet and b) will definitely break apt
2005-06-14T11:16:00.000Z	jahor	bob2	thanx... i just wanted to hack it cleanly... now i see u need to compile ;o)
2005-06-14T11:16:00.000Z	bob2	jahor	you can just compile the sid source package
2005-06-14T11:17:00.000Z	bob2	jahor	so you get a .deb of the new version that is properly installable on ubuntu
2005-06-14T11:17:00.000Z	jahor	bob2	i know... but most of the time (evening) i'm not online and i didn't have all the damn -dev packages ;o)
2005-06-14T11:17:00.000Z	bob2	jahor	ah, right
2005-06-14T11:20:00.000Z	bob2	jahor	depends what you want
2005-06-14T11:23:00.000Z	jahor	bob2	i want to have all -deb packages related to packages i have installed... i wrote some bash foo for installing them but it didn't work ;o)
2005-06-14T11:24:00.000Z	jahor	bob2	the whole problem is that i came from slack/arch/crux and i used to have all for compiling out of the box ;o)
