2008-04-02T08:34:00.000Z	stbain	elexhobby	what sort of data?
2008-04-02T08:38:00.000Z	stbain	elexhobby	what exactly is (or was) stored on /dev/hdb3?
2008-04-02T08:39:00.000Z	elexhobby	stbain	some videos/audios and documents..
2008-04-02T08:40:00.000Z	elexhobby	stbain	105GB around
2008-04-02T08:41:00.000Z	elexhobby	stbain	that was full of mp3 audio files
2008-04-02T08:42:00.000Z	stbain	elexhobby	the partition and the partition table may be corrupt
2008-04-02T08:43:00.000Z	elexhobby	stbain	what do i do now? can i recover the old files?
2008-04-02T08:43:00.000Z	stbain	elexhobby	I imagine you'll have some data loss for the sectors that were overwritten
2008-04-02T08:43:00.000Z	stbain	elexhobby	and there's a chance you may have overwritten the filesystem table
2008-04-02T08:43:00.000Z	elexhobby	stbain	no problem.. i'd aborted the dd_rescue in almost 10 secs, so not much data would be lost
2008-04-02T08:44:00.000Z	stbain	elexhobby	you may want to boot off of a live cd and try to mount or fsck the partitions to see what can be salvaged
2008-04-02T08:45:00.000Z	stbain	elexhobby	I literally am in my datacenter (albeit at 11:45PM) doing much of the same thing you just did... using dd_rescue to transfer a disk elsewhere
2008-04-02T08:45:00.000Z	elexhobby	stbain	i'm a newbie to ubuntu.. do u mean i shud reboot and insert live cd.. what i do then?
2008-04-02T08:46:00.000Z	stbain	elexhobby	are you a newbie to all flavors of Linux or just new to Ubuntu?
2008-04-02T08:46:00.000Z	elexhobby	stbain	to all flavors.. infact ubuntu is the first linux i've tried out
2008-04-02T08:48:00.000Z	elexhobby	stbain	shud i do that immediately.. c-ron had asked me not to reboot at all
2008-04-02T08:51:00.000Z	stbain	elexhobby	what version of ubuntu are you running?
2008-04-02T08:52:00.000Z	stbain	elexhobby	nevermind, I see it on your forum post (7.10)
