2009-07-26T03:11:00.000Z	sman		hey I can't press up cursor in urxvt
2009-07-26T03:11:00.000Z	sman		it affects everything run in urxvt (aka rxvt-unicode)
2009-07-26T03:12:00.000Z	prince_jammys	sman	pressing up doesn't show you the previous command in your history?
2009-07-26T03:13:00.000Z	sman	prince_jammys	no
2009-07-26T03:13:00.000Z	sman	prince_jammys	it doesn't do anything
2009-07-26T03:13:00.000Z	sman	prince_jammys	it works in tty however, but I have now realised that any graphical terminal emulator has the flaw
2009-07-26T03:15:00.000Z	sman	prince_jammys	any ideas?
2009-07-26T03:16:00.000Z	sman	prince_jammys	it works in tty, so I'm guessing it's something to do with xorg
2009-07-26T03:17:00.000Z	prince_jammys	sman	perhaps it has to do with locale variables
2009-07-26T03:17:00.000Z	sman	prince_jammys	well that's what I thought but it would affect tty if so
2009-07-26T03:18:00.000Z	prince_jammys	sman	try invoking urxvt like this:  LC_ALL=$LANG urxvt
2009-07-26T03:19:00.000Z	sman	prince_jammys	ooh, whenever I press up the command "lpr" is run
2009-07-26T03:19:00.000Z	sman	prince_jammys	thats linux print right?
2009-07-26T03:19:00.000Z	prince_jammys	sman	yes
2009-07-26T03:19:00.000Z	sman	prince_jammys	I don't even have it installed..
2009-07-26T03:19:00.000Z	prince_jammys		bizarre
2009-07-26T03:19:00.000Z	sman	prince_jammys	mind if I PM you?
2009-07-26T03:20:00.000Z	prince_jammys	sman	ok
