2005-12-16T08:56:00.000Z	gnomefreak	shanonx	 after you make changes run sudo apt-get update
2006-02-22T07:01:00.000Z	gnomefreak	shanonx	do you know what make/model the nic card is?
2006-02-22T07:03:00.000Z	shanonx	gnomefreak	Its an Intel 82573V
2006-02-22T07:08:00.000Z	gnomefreak	shanonx	when installing does it let you continue the install without detecting the nic?
2006-02-22T07:08:00.000Z	shanonx	gnomefreak	It gave me the option to, but I didn'
2006-02-22T07:10:00.000Z	gnomefreak	shanonx	next time continue get it installed you might just have to activate the nic. i only see 3 intel cards here im not sure what your chipset is here ill give you the link incase you find the chipset

2006-02-22T07:10:00.000Z	shanonx	gnomefreak	ok, thanks for your help!
2006-02-22T13:21:00.000Z	shanonx	gnomefreak	hey I talked to you this morning about intstalling without my NIC card... well I got it installed but now when I boot I get an error saying X server isnt configured correctly.
2006-02-22T13:22:00.000Z	gnomefreak	shanonx	in terminal type sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg and re do all the proper settings
2006-02-22T13:39:00.000Z	shanonx	gnomefreak	when i run xserver reconfigure, it asks me for the pCI address of my graphics card, and my graphics card is a PCI-Express, how can i found out the address of that card if I don't know it?
2006-02-22T13:50:00.000Z	shanonx	gnomefreak	oh well i still get the error (EE) no devices detected, Fatal error: no screens found...... so how do i get grub out of my master boot?
2006-02-22T13:50:00.000Z	gnomefreak	shanonx	why do you want grub off mbr?
2006-02-22T13:51:00.000Z	shanonx	gnomefreak	because it looks like ubuntu cannot handle pci-express, at least with this motherboard
2006-02-22T14:15:00.000Z	gnomefreak	shanonx	iirc in dos you can run fixmbr and it will erase grub from it
2006-02-22T14:16:00.000Z	gnomefreak	shanonx	deleteing grub will not delete ubuntu
2006-02-22T14:16:00.000Z	shanonx	gnomefreak	i know, I will just erase grub then clear out that partition for now
