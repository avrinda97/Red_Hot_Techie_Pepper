2010-08-25T07:10:00.000Z	edbian	avi__	Was I wrong?
2010-08-25T07:11:00.000Z	avi__	edbian	I'm something of a novice to hardcore linux stuff, but your command doesn't do it for me, neither does his, and using samba myself on Lucid, my command does the trick :)
2010-08-25T07:11:00.000Z	edbian	avi__	Yeah they have a new method of starting /ending services in Ubuntu 10.04.  Are you sure you have samba installed?  I was under the impression the old commands worked fine.
2010-08-25T07:12:00.000Z	edbian	avi__	Go into /etc/init.d/   do you have a samba file?
2010-08-25T07:12:00.000Z	edbian	avi__	Do you have a /etc/init.d/   smbd   ?
2010-08-25T07:13:00.000Z	avi__	edbian	Yes I definitely have samba installed. I also have /etc/init.d/smbd
2010-08-25T07:13:00.000Z	edbian	avi__	So sudo /etc/init.d/smbd restart should work.
2010-08-25T07:14:00.000Z	avi__	edbian	Rather than invoking init scripts through /etc/init.d, use the service(8) utility, e.g. service smbd restart Since the script you are attempting to invoke has been converted to an Upstart job, you may also use the restart(8) utility, e.g. restart smbd smbd start/running, process 21158
2010-08-25T07:15:00.000Z	edbian	avi__	I know the knew method.  But I thought you said nothing was working?
2010-08-25T07:15:00.000Z	avi__	edbian	That's what I get running that command. So it works, but it tells us that it would rather have the new lucid way, which I'm fine with because it looks nicer.
2010-08-25T07:15:00.000Z	edbian	avi__	oooh ic
2010-08-25T07:15:00.000Z	edbian	avi__	Yes.  /etc/init.d/networking restart   is tedious especially when teaching new people and having to explain what is going on.
2010-08-25T07:17:00.000Z	avi__	edbian	Okay I just looked back at what everyone said. You're both using the right syntax, but it's "smbd" not "samba". The former works for me, the latter gives the error he reported. Blasted upstart, changing things on us :)
2010-08-25T07:17:00.000Z	edbian	avi__	Yeah.  Thanks for letting me know you cleared it up :)
2010-08-25T07:17:00.000Z	edbian	avi__	smbd  samba  god
2010-08-25T07:18:00.000Z	avi__	edbian	Hah. This is why I keep a "notes" file in my ~ :)
2010-08-25T07:18:00.000Z	edbian	avi__	clever idea!
2010-08-25T07:18:00.000Z	avi__	edbian	How to restart samba was actually one of the first things on that list :P
