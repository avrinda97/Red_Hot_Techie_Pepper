2010-01-06T08:51:00.000Z	Ilmatic		K.
2010-01-06T08:53:00.000Z	Ilmatic		Damn it.
2010-01-06T08:53:00.000Z	Ilmatic		Nothing still.
2010-01-06T08:53:00.000Z	Ilmatic		Skin changed.
2010-01-06T08:53:00.000Z	Ilmatic		Everything else is still the same.
2010-01-06T08:53:00.000Z	Ilmatic		yes sir.
2010-01-06T08:54:00.000Z	Ilmatic		Dallas can I run that in metacity?
2010-01-06T08:54:00.000Z	Ilmatic		Terminal isn't working for me/
2010-01-06T08:56:00.000Z	Ilmatic		Thanks Dallas.
2010-01-06T08:56:00.000Z	Ilmatic		I'll be sure to give this one a try.
2010-01-06T08:56:00.000Z	JoshDreamland	Ilmatic	Did this problem come about after reboot? Or after sleep? Or spontaneously?
2010-01-06T08:57:00.000Z	JoshDreamland	Ilmatic	There's probably a config file I'm unaware of somewhere that the new settings managed to screw up. I've noticed Linux has a knack for that.
2010-01-06T08:59:00.000Z	JoshDreamland	Ilmatic	Oh, have you tried going to "customize" and selecting a border?
2010-01-06T08:59:00.000Z	JoshDreamland	Ilmatic	If that doesn't work, I give up on UI-based fixes
2010-01-06T09:03:00.000Z	JoshDreamland	Ilmatic	That's often a simple solution on Linux. However...
2010-01-06T09:04:00.000Z	JoshDreamland	Ilmatic	is metacity running?
2010-01-06T09:05:00.000Z	JoshDreamland	Ilmatic	You can't see metacity. You only know it exists when things like this go wrong.
2010-01-06T09:09:00.000Z	JoshDreamland	Ilmatic	You may want to just reboot, then. I can't predict what will happen.
