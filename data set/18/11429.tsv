2006-08-11T11:39:00.000Z	RoninGurl		Why would VNC to Ubuntu be slower than Remote Desktop to WinXP between thet same computers -- and there is ZERO traffic on the network right now. It's terribly, horribly slow with VNC to Ubuntu.
2006-08-11T11:40:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	RoninGurl	vnc is always slower than remote desktop, probable something to do with the amount of information that is needing to be transmitted, remote desktop for instance may well not show you the remote pc's wallpaper but vnc will
2006-08-11T11:41:00.000Z	RoninGurl	TheGateKeeper	VNC is not configurable to not do such things?
2006-08-11T11:41:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	RoninGurl	correct
2006-08-11T11:41:00.000Z	RoninGurl	TheGateKeeper	just lazy programmers or just hidden somewhere?
2006-08-11T11:42:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	RoninGurl	not lazy programmers, the two methods will be using different mechanisms
2006-08-11T11:43:00.000Z	RoninGurl	TheGateKeeper	but even with all sounds being forwarded and desktop  background, WinXP remote desktop is 3 - 5 times faster than VNC on the same exact LAN, same exact computers, zero traffic elsewhere.
2006-08-11T11:44:00.000Z	RoninGurl	TheGateKeeper	Ych, even a bash shell takes a few seconds to update using ultavnc viewer. i even tried tightvnc viewer.
2006-08-11T11:44:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	RoninGurl	if VNC has to compress & then uncompress 10x the info remote desktop does then hardly surprising
2006-08-11T11:45:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	RoninGurl	doesn't surprise me
2006-08-11T11:45:00.000Z	RoninGurl	TheGateKeeper	how is it 10 times the info if remote desktop also transmits wallpapers, and even sound... i could be playing an mp3... and it would appear on client machine speakers, not host and still not get lag.
2006-08-11T11:46:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	RoninGurl	are you a programmer?
2006-08-11T11:48:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	RoninGurl	I don't know if it's 10x or 1000x or 10000x I have not looked closely under the surface, if you reduce the reolution of the target pc that will probable help, also use a plain background wallpaper
2006-08-11T11:49:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	RoninGurl	resolution ooops
2006-08-11T11:51:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	RoninGurl	if you want to control a remote linux machine either do what I said, or use an X server at one end and an X client at the other, or just use the cli
2006-08-11T11:53:00.000Z	RoninGurl	TheGateKeeper	FreeNX doesnt have a windows client... its useless except to *nix zealots
2006-08-11T11:57:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	RoninGurl	download one from here: http://www.nomachine.com/
2006-08-11T11:58:00.000Z	TheGateKeeper	RoninGurl	their client is free but you have to pay for the server don't know if it will work with freenx as the server
