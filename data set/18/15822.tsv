2006-02-24T13:10:00.000Z	HappyFool	cppnewbie	it depends what you're trying to compile. build-essential is good enough for compiling basic C/C++ programs
2006-03-09T07:00:00.000Z	HappyFool	cppnewbie	are you accessing a windows partition?
2006-03-09T07:00:00.000Z	HappyFool	cppnewbie	what type of partition is it?
2006-03-09T07:01:00.000Z	HappyFool	cppnewbie	yah
2006-03-09T07:01:00.000Z	HappyFool	cppnewbie	read the first link ubotu just posted; you just need a 'umask=000' parameter in your mount command (probably fstab)
2006-03-09T07:02:00.000Z	HappyFool	cppnewbie	fat32 and ntfs are generically referred to as 'windows' partitions
2006-03-09T07:03:00.000Z	HappyFool	cppnewbie	remounting with '-o umask=000' might do it
2006-03-09T07:06:00.000Z	HappyFool	cppnewbie	so how did you mount it in the first place?
