2012-01-15T04:40:00.000Z	northernen		Is there a setting which disabled auto-hide of top pane/bar? (I don't want to hover to the top to see the menu.)
2012-01-15T04:40:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	northernen	 install CCSM, open it, choose unity desktop plugin
2012-01-15T04:42:00.000Z	northernen	MonkeyDust	any particular setting therein? I can't find anything related.
2012-01-15T04:43:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	northernen	 Desktop, Unity desktop plugin, there you find autohide
2012-01-15T04:44:00.000Z	northernen	MonkeyDust	is that not just for the side panel?
2012-01-15T04:44:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	northernen	 isnt that what you asked or wanted?
2012-01-15T04:46:00.000Z	northernen	MonkeyDust	I've sorted the side bar. I meant the menu bar at the top of applications, such as "Xchat View Settings ...". I don't want to have to hover to the top to get them visible, but have them permanently visible.
2012-01-15T04:47:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	northernen	 you mean globalmenu?
2012-01-15T04:48:00.000Z	northernen	MonkeyDust	yes, I think so.
2012-01-15T04:48:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	northernen	 there's a way to disable and have the menu in the window
2012-01-15T04:49:00.000Z	northernen	MonkeyDust	through the Unity plugin?
2012-01-15T04:51:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	northernen	 check this, but i don't think it's possible http://www.webupd8.org/2011/04/things-to-tweak-fix-after-installing.html
2012-01-15T04:54:00.000Z	northernen	MonkeyDust	I mean the upper left side, not the upper right side (with the time and that).
2012-01-15T04:54:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	northernen	 on that page, search globalmenu
2012-01-15T05:05:00.000Z	northernen	MonkeyDust	got it. Not a pretty fix, but it works I suppose. Thanks for help.
2012-01-15T05:06:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	northernen	 what did you do exactly
2012-01-15T05:06:00.000Z	northernen	MonkeyDust	uninstalled "indicator-appmenu" package.
