2011-01-28T13:48:00.000Z	dosydoo1234		hi can someone help i need to run a fsdsk on ubunut 10.10 as the hard drive is making funny noises
2011-01-28T13:49:00.000Z	Loshki	dosydoo1234	have you backed up anything you can't live without on that hd? I'd do that first...
2011-01-28T13:50:00.000Z	dosydoo1234	Loshki	i understand i need to run it from the start, but how do i get  a command line prompt at start up ?
2011-01-28T13:50:00.000Z	dosydoo1234	Loshki	i understand that i cant run it whilst im on gnome
2011-01-28T13:50:00.000Z	dosydoo1234	Loshki	the disk utility has check filesystem and repair but it says drive is busy so i think i need to restart at command line ?
2011-01-28T13:51:00.000Z	dosydoo1234	Loshki	but not sure how to do this
2011-01-28T13:51:00.000Z	Loshki	dosydoo1234	and do you also understand that 'funny noises' from a disk usually mean a hardware failure, something that probably can't be fixed via fsck?
2011-01-28T13:52:00.000Z	dosydoo1234	Loshki	it happened before and i wiped it and started again and it was fine but maybe fsck will do it ?
2011-01-28T13:53:00.000Z	dosydoo1234	Loshki	i have tried shutdown - r F but that did not work
2011-01-28T13:53:00.000Z	Loshki	dosydoo1234	it's worth trying. which disk is it?
2011-01-28T13:53:00.000Z	dosydoo1234	Loshki	it is my only disk the one that the system is mounted on
2011-01-28T13:54:00.000Z	dosydoo1234	Loshki	i suppose i dont know how to start 10.10 in command line and then run the fsk command
2011-01-28T13:54:00.000Z	Loshki	dosydoo1234	try the forcefsck trick here: http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/linux-force-fsck-on-the-next-reboot-or-boot-sequence/
2011-01-28T13:55:00.000Z	dosydoo1234	Loshki	tried that it is not working
2011-01-28T13:56:00.000Z	dosydoo1234	Loshki	how do i force 10.10 to go to command line to start with - it always goes to the login screen., 9.04 had options at the start to go to command line
2011-01-28T13:57:00.000Z	Loshki	dosydoo1234	Sorry dunno. I don't run gdm. Can you boot a live cd? That's probably next easiest
2011-01-28T13:57:00.000Z	dosydoo1234	Loshki	cant believe 10.10 does not have the option to start at command line
2011-01-28T13:59:00.000Z	Loshki	dosydoo1234	not sure it would help anyway. You still can't fsck a disk partition while you're running from it...
