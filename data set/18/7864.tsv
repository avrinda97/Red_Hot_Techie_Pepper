2007-11-03T03:27:00.000Z	betamale		my laptop even hangs when I boot from the Ubuntu setup CD, with the same messages:
2007-11-03T03:27:00.000Z	betamale		"recovery required on readonly filesystem"
2007-11-03T03:27:00.000Z	betamale		"orphan cleaup on readonly fs"
2007-11-03T03:27:00.000Z	betamale		does anyone have any suggestions of how to even get to the shell from this state?
2007-11-03T03:28:00.000Z	hairulfr	betamale	Boot windows and close it down properly, I think
2007-11-03T03:28:00.000Z	betamale	hairulfr	close it down properly?
2007-11-03T03:28:00.000Z	betamale	hairulfr	I just booted windows to see if that still works, and properly shut it down from there
2007-11-03T03:30:00.000Z	hairulfr	betamale	Weird, run some sort of disk diagnostic? I've installed on very very freaky drives, hmm always without problems.
2007-11-03T03:31:00.000Z	betamale	hairulfr	thanks, I'll try some disk diagnostics. this started with uswsusp/hibernate though, on a system that worked before...
2007-11-03T03:38:00.000Z	betamale	hairulfr	do you have any suggestions on alternative "live" cds that I could try?
2007-11-03T03:39:00.000Z	hairulfr	betamale	For partitioning?
2007-11-03T03:39:00.000Z	betamale	hairulfr	anything that could get me to do some diagnostics, inspect fstab, etc.
2007-11-03T03:41:00.000Z	hairulfr	betamale	gparted livecd is quite good, i've used that,
2007-11-03T04:05:00.000Z	betamale	hairulfr	the gparted boots up correctly, and is now checking my filesystem (which seems to take forever)
2007-11-03T04:05:00.000Z	hairulfr	betamale	Cool, glad it has come so far, hope you get it to work :)
2007-11-03T04:06:00.000Z	betamale	hairulfr	so do I; brand new work-laptop, this is totally stressing me out :-Z
2007-11-03T04:07:00.000Z	hairulfr	betamale	Yeah, it sounds like a weird fault though,
2007-11-03T04:13:00.000Z	betamale	hairulfr	it just fixed a whole lot of errors, and the system boots again. sort of. I get dropped instantly to the root prompt(!). but progress, thanks again.
