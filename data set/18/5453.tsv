2010-10-14T14:10:00.000Z	kai696		Hey all, for some reason Gparted is taking one heck of a long time to expand my SDA1 volume... (hours upon hours), anyone know why this might be ?
2010-10-14T14:10:00.000Z	kai696		(fast enough computer, really shouldn't take that long. 4gb ram 2.6ghz)
2010-10-14T14:11:00.000Z	Maddeth	kai696	how much data you got on it? and if it was a windows partition did you defrag before?
2010-10-14T14:12:00.000Z	Maddeth	kai696	wait.. just expanding?
2010-10-14T14:12:00.000Z	kai696	Maddeth	running live DVD of ubuntu 8.04m disk size 250GB expanding to 500GB..
2010-10-14T14:12:00.000Z	kai696		the expansion is a windows partition, yes
2010-10-14T14:13:00.000Z	Maddeth	kai696	the space that it is being expanded into, is it free or being moved?
2010-10-14T14:13:00.000Z	kai696		unallocated space to ntfs
2010-10-14T14:13:00.000Z	kai696		(ie, existing NTFS @ 250GB; another 250 unallocated (Deleted partition))
2010-10-14T14:14:00.000Z	Maddeth	kai696	hmm, not sure why it is taking so long then, how long has it been running, and what is it doing at the moment?
