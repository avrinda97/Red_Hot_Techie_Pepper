2010-12-23T22:25:00.000Z	vladc		Hi, what's the easiest way of copying the raw data from a Ubuntu partition onto a networked Windows computer?
2010-12-23T22:26:00.000Z	Aut0ExeC	vladc	dd with nc?
2010-12-23T22:26:00.000Z	Aut0ExeC	vladc	k
2010-12-23T22:27:00.000Z	Aut0ExeC	vladc	dd is for entire partition tho
2010-12-23T22:28:00.000Z	Aut0ExeC	vladc	dd is more raw tho bro
2010-12-23T22:30:00.000Z	Aut0ExeC	vladc	on the other pc have is listening tho on that same port
2010-12-23T22:31:00.000Z	Aut0ExeC	vladc	go with giles advice and make sure unmount the partition first
2010-12-23T22:32:00.000Z	Aut0ExeC	vladc	there is netcat for windows
2010-12-23T22:32:00.000Z	Aut0ExeC	vladc	make sure ur firewall is off and AV disabled :)
2010-12-23T22:32:00.000Z	Aut0ExeC	vladc	keep in mind that linux file systems wont be any use on a windowz pc as well
2010-12-23T22:32:00.000Z	vladc	Aut0ExeC	Oh good, I'll look at netcat for windows. The destination is windows because I want to make a backup before the HD crashed for good :)
2010-12-23T22:33:00.000Z	Aut0ExeC	vladc	ohhh ok in that case then yes
2010-12-23T22:33:00.000Z	Aut0ExeC	vladc	sounds like u really want to use clonezilla tho ... its much easier to impliment backup and restore
2010-12-23T22:36:00.000Z	Aut0ExeC	vladc	if ur using fat32 then  u will have to break apart ur data into 2 gig segments.... just use clonezilla dude.... it makes it easier
2010-12-23T22:37:00.000Z	vladc	Aut0ExeC	Yup, I'll try that...
2010-12-23T22:40:00.000Z	Aut0ExeC	vladc	please use clonezilla
2010-12-23T22:40:00.000Z	Aut0ExeC	vladc	u can use samba or ssh copying with clonezilla
2010-12-23T22:41:00.000Z	Aut0ExeC	vladc	good for u man
