2010-05-03T03:12:00.000Z	nikos_ltd		does ubuntu 10.04 have problems with multiboot kernels ?
2010-05-03T03:13:00.000Z	sebsebseb	nikos_ltd	ah ha Grub 2 can't boot other Linux distro issue, or?
2010-05-03T03:13:00.000Z	nikos_ltd	sebsebseb	nope. It's AROS.
2010-05-03T03:13:00.000Z	sebsebseb	nikos_ltd	what's AROS ?
2010-05-03T03:13:00.000Z	nikos_ltd	sebsebseb	operative system aros.org
2010-05-03T03:14:00.000Z	nikos_ltd	sebsebseb	with 9.10 it booted fine
2010-05-03T03:14:00.000Z	sebsebseb	nikos_ltd	ok I don't know about that one, but apparnatly there is an issue with Ubuntu's version of Grub 2, so not the proper upstream one it seems.  Where other Linux distro's can't just be booted from it.
2010-05-03T03:14:00.000Z	sebsebseb	nikos_ltd	so this might apply to some other OS's as well
2010-05-03T03:14:00.000Z	sebsebseb	nikos_ltd	altough this issue was for 9.10,  may apply for 10.04 as well, I don't know
2010-05-03T03:16:00.000Z	nikos_ltd	sebsebseb	I had no problems with 9.10
2010-05-03T03:16:00.000Z	nikos_ltd	sebsebseb	yes I see
2010-05-03T03:17:00.000Z	nikos_ltd	sebsebseb	is there a way to get back grub 1.97 beta 4
2010-05-03T03:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	nikos_ltd	I guess some how, but you could even install the old version of Grub, which is good, but no longer supported upstream
2010-05-03T03:17:00.000Z	nikos_ltd	sebsebseb	I need grub 2
2010-05-03T03:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	nikos_ltd	I guess so some how, above (I wanted to put the so in)
2010-05-03T03:18:00.000Z	nikos_ltd	sebsebseb	grub 1.97 beta 4 worked great
2010-05-03T03:18:00.000Z	sebsebseb	nikos_ltd	Canonical edit Grub 2 it seems, as well as quite a lot other packages,  as a result the upstream version of Grub 2 is probably quite different really
2010-05-03T03:19:00.000Z	sebsebseb	nikos_ltd	Grub 2 is worse than the old one, for a lot of us.  Uhmmm maybe you can get help from the bot page it is about to give you.  Maybe you can get help in #grub  after telling them your on Ubuntu 10.04.
