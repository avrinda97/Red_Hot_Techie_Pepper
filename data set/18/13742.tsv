2006-07-20T16:40:00.000Z	ardchoille	nekostar	Yes, I have a link, hold on
2006-07-20T16:40:00.000Z	nekostar	ardchoille	ive got a few links :/
2006-07-20T16:41:00.000Z	ardchoille	nekostar	I wrote this one so I know it works
2006-07-20T16:42:00.000Z	ardchoille	nekostar	Here is the informatin that I used to setup Evo with gmail: http://natsci.eckerd.edu/~bordelsr/gnomehelp/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Gnome212.EvolutionGmail
2006-07-20T16:43:00.000Z	ardchoille	nekostar	It seems they took part of my how to out, I wish people wouldn't delete stuff from my how-to's because I know this works.
2006-07-20T16:45:00.000Z	ardchoille	nekostar	you set the port with pop.gmail.com:995 in the server field.
2006-07-20T16:48:00.000Z	ardchoille	nekostar	Sorry about that, I didn't know they changed my how-to. I'd walk you through it but I don't have Evo installed on this machine
2006-07-20T16:49:00.000Z	ardchoille	nekostar	Isn't there a button that reads "Check what the server accepts" or some such?
2006-07-20T16:49:00.000Z	nekostar	ardchoille	mind if i dcc u a pic of the screen in question ??
2006-07-20T16:49:00.000Z	ardchoille	nekostar	How about posting the pic on http://www.imageshack.us/
2006-07-20T16:50:00.000Z	ardchoille	nekostar	there is no join
2006-07-20T16:51:00.000Z	ardchoille	nekostar	See that button that says "check for supported types"?
2006-07-20T16:52:00.000Z	nekostar	ardchoille	yeah tried it
2006-07-20T16:52:00.000Z	ardchoille	nekostar	That button should return info to Evo and change the feilds to the correct settings. That is what was in my how-to. If that isn't working, then I don't know what to say :(
