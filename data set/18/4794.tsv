2009-08-15T04:43:00.000Z	bucky	Cerrdor	did you install flash from a tar ball or did you install it with the package manager?
2009-08-15T04:44:00.000Z	Cerrdor	bucky	through apt
2009-08-15T04:44:00.000Z	bucky	Cerrdor	dpkg -l flashplugin-nonfree
2009-08-15T04:44:00.000Z	bucky	Cerrdor	it's not installed
2009-08-15T04:46:00.000Z	bucky	Cerrdor	it's not installed how do you expect it to work if it's not installed?
2009-08-15T04:46:00.000Z	bucky	Cerrdor	sudo apt-get install  flashplugin-nonfree
2009-08-15T04:57:00.000Z	bucky	Cerrdor	is the test video asking for the H.232 video protocol?
