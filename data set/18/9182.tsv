2008-08-28T23:34:00.000Z	Fazer		hello, my friend has an Asmax BR-604 router and he hasn't got connection to the internet; he already compiled drivers for his net card
2008-08-28T23:35:00.000Z	Fazer		we already looked for solution, but to no avail
2008-08-28T23:35:00.000Z	Gnea	Fazer	using wired or wireless?
2008-08-28T23:50:00.000Z	Fazer	Gnea	sorry, I was away; he's trying to use wired connection
2008-08-28T23:52:00.000Z	Gnea	Fazer	he should be able to plug it in and have it 'just work'. is there something weird about his network card? ubuntu 8.04 supports just about everything.
2008-08-28T23:52:00.000Z	Fazer	Gnea	he did that and it didn't work
2008-08-28T23:53:00.000Z	Fazer	Gnea	I found more people have problems with that router
2008-08-28T23:53:00.000Z	Gnea	Fazer	maybe he should return it and get another? :/
2008-08-28T23:54:00.000Z	Fazer	Gnea	his router works ok with Windows XP
2008-08-29T00:11:00.000Z	Fazer	Gnea	I've just been told that his router sees his computer in dhcp clients, it can see his MAC address, but he can't connect to internet
2008-08-29T00:13:00.000Z	Gnea	Fazer	can he connect his computer directly to internet without the router?
2008-08-29T00:16:00.000Z	Fazer	Gnea	I'm asking him
2008-08-29T00:16:00.000Z	Gnea	Fazer	okay.
2008-08-29T00:19:00.000Z	Fazer	Gnea	he tried connencting directly to modem and it didin't work - btw he doesn't need password to connect, so UbuDSL probably won't help here
2008-08-29T00:20:00.000Z	Gnea	Fazer	why would it work in XP and not Linux I wonder?
2008-08-29T00:20:00.000Z	Fazer	Gnea	maybe it's something with IP tables?
2008-08-29T00:23:00.000Z	Fazer	Gnea	his router is 4 years old, maybe it doesn't support IPv6?
2008-08-29T00:23:00.000Z	Gnea	Fazer	o.O probably not lol
