2010-10-31T13:05:00.000Z	Tuplad		My extern hdd is acting up lately, I thought of fsck'ing it, but when I try to do it I get an error "fsck.ext2: Superblock invalid, trying backup blocks..." I have tried e2fsck -b 4096 and fsck -y and other things I've found on the internet, but I still can't get a scan. The disk works alright and is accessable but sometimes does weird stuff and reconnects by itself etc.
2010-10-31T13:05:00.000Z	Tuplad		How can I fix it ?
2010-10-31T13:06:00.000Z	Tuplad		fsck /dev/sdf doesn't work and I get that error, but fsck /dev/sdf1 works fine
2010-10-31T13:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Tuplad	 sdf is the whold drive.. sdf1 is a filesystem. You proberly never want to fsck sdf :)
2011-04-30T18:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Tuplad	 whats your video chipset?
2011-04-30T18:22:00.000Z	Tuplad	Dr_Willis	Nvidia GT540m - I downloaded from the site, installed, rebooted... now I'm in TTY trying to fix it.
2011-04-30T18:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Tuplad	 downloaded from what site? I use the drivers included in the repositories.. not any from nvidia.com
2011-04-30T18:23:00.000Z	Tuplad	Dr_Willis	the ones from repos didn't work at all, I downloaded from nvidia.com
2011-04-30T18:24:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Tuplad	 no idea on those. I just use the ones from the repos.
2011-04-30T18:24:00.000Z	Tuplad	Dr_Willis	the one in repos don't work either, I can uninstall the nvidia.com ones
2011-04-30T19:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Tuplad	 whats your video chipset?
2011-04-30T19:26:00.000Z	Tuplad	Dr_Willis	Geforce GT540M
2011-04-30T19:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Tuplad	 the drivers from the repos dont work? You could try the answers given here --> ^^^
2011-04-30T19:27:00.000Z	Tuplad	Dr_Willis	I don't think they work, because I can't access nvidia settings and I can't install unity.
2011-04-30T19:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Tuplad	 you are upgradeing? or what exactly? theres Unity-2d you could use I guess
2011-04-30T19:28:00.000Z	Tuplad	Dr_Willis	fresh install, I want Unity-3d, not 2d :D
2011-04-30T19:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Tuplad	 unity is installed by default.. and it needs the 3d drivers..
2011-04-30T19:29:00.000Z	Tuplad	Dr_Willis	exactly, everything is installed, but it doesn't work. GLX doesn't seem to work and I can't make it work :(
