2012-02-24T01:03:00.000Z	ch33z		I need help
2012-02-24T01:03:00.000Z	Chipzzz	ch33z	no doubt... can you be more specific
2012-02-24T01:04:00.000Z	Chipzzz	ch33z	you didn't specify a destination
2012-02-24T01:05:00.000Z	Chipzzz	ch33z	sudo mkdir /directory/name
2012-02-24T01:08:00.000Z	Chipzzz	ch33z	if memory serves /etc/apache2/sites-available/default is the default file that you would copy to another file name after the server you want to create... lemme find you some directions... hang on
2012-02-24T01:11:00.000Z	Chipzzz	ch33z	here you go: https://help.ubuntu.com/8.04/serverguide/C/httpd.html
2012-02-24T01:14:00.000Z	Chipzzz	ch33z	sudo chmod 644 /directory/to/be/changed
2012-02-24T01:16:00.000Z	Chipzzz	ch33z	actually, 644 isn't right for writing... you'd want 777 to write from any account
2012-02-24T01:18:00.000Z	Chipzzz	ch33z	or 677 (turn off the execute bit so you don't get too easily hacked)
2012-02-24T01:18:00.000Z	Chipzzz	ch33z	sorrt... 666
2012-02-24T01:25:00.000Z	Chipzzz	ch33z	its a config fole, not an executable
2012-02-25T05:54:00.000Z	Chipzzz	ch33z	you around?
2012-02-25T21:44:00.000Z	Chipzzz	ch33z	for the time being, they're fine
2012-02-25T21:47:00.000Z	Chipzzz	ch33z	is that in the section about virtual hosts?
2012-02-25T21:48:00.000Z	Chipzzz	ch33z	ah... they're probably talking about setting up the directories for sub-domains
2012-02-25T21:49:00.000Z	Chipzzz	ch33z	no, it's a matter for the http server configuration to deal with
2012-02-25T21:50:00.000Z	Chipzzz	ch33z	the DNS server only concerns itself with the TLD
2012-02-25T23:21:00.000Z	Chipzzz	ch33z	still here?
