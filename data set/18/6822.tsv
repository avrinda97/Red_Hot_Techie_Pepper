2008-03-19T22:23:00.000Z	steven22		Good afternoon anyone, could anyone help me figure a way out on how i can use my usb audio to work with firefox
2008-03-19T22:24:00.000Z	fbc	steven22	you just got to get it to work, period.
2008-03-19T22:24:00.000Z	fbc	steven22	once it works with linux firefox will follow.
2008-03-19T22:24:00.000Z	steven22	fbc	what do u mean? my usb audio works but flash is comming out of my internal speakers
2008-03-19T22:25:00.000Z	fbc	steven22	ahh..
2008-03-19T22:25:00.000Z	fbc	steven22	now we are getting to the root problem.
2008-03-19T22:25:00.000Z	steven22	fbc	yeaah sorry haha
2008-03-19T22:26:00.000Z	fbc	steven22	OK, so firefox uses the internal audio card while the other stuff uses the usb audio.. hmm, Have you tried going into the audio preferences and seting your default audio output source?
2008-03-19T22:28:00.000Z	steven22	fbc	i've tried the command asoundconf
2008-03-19T22:28:00.000Z	steven22	fbc	and i tried to reset the default to the usb
2008-03-19T22:28:00.000Z	fbc	steven22	how about disabling your internal sound card in the bios that way firefox will not have a choice.
2008-03-19T22:29:00.000Z	steven22	fbc	how do i disable the internal sound on the bios
2008-03-19T22:30:00.000Z	fbc	steven22	when your computer boots up you press DEL on most computers.
2008-03-19T22:32:00.000Z	steven22	fbc	is there another way i could do this without messin with the biois
2008-03-19T22:32:00.000Z	steven22	fbc	bios*
2008-03-19T22:33:00.000Z	fbc	steven22	nope,, but your not going to break anything I promise. It's all menu driven...
2008-03-19T22:34:00.000Z	fbc	steven22	once your in the bios navigation instruction should appear at the bottom of your screen and look around for the option to disable your internal audio card.
2008-03-19T22:34:00.000Z	steven22	fbc	ok i'll try that.. i do have a dual boot by the way
