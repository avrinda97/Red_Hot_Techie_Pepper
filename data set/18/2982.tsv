2010-01-09T16:28:00.000Z	oCean_	Guest85475	iirc, initial install will give an "install page", where you can specify msql db, locations etc
2010-01-09T16:30:00.000Z	Guest85475	oCean_	I'm way past that. Installed fine, getting the Main_Page just fine. But I get blank pages for say if I click edit or discussion on Main_Page
2010-01-09T16:31:00.000Z	oCean_	Guest85475	since that's most likely not an ubuntu issue, you could as well ask in #mediawiki
2010-01-09T16:32:00.000Z	Guest85475	oCean_	Well. Given that it also happens with what aptitude install mediawiki creates, I'd say it was an ubuntu issue.
2010-01-09T16:33:00.000Z	oCean_	Guest85475	I only remember a successful install on 9.04, have not tried on 9.10 yet
2010-01-09T16:45:00.000Z	oCean_	Guest85475	just finished install of mw on 9.10 - no issues here...
2010-01-09T16:45:00.000Z	Guest85475	oCean_	if editing Main_Page works for you, then I guess I must have b0rked sometihng.
2010-01-09T16:46:00.000Z	oCean_	Guest85475	you edited the correct php.ini? (/etc/php5/apache2/php.ini) and reloaded apache?
2010-01-09T16:46:00.000Z	Guest85475	oCean_	yep and yep
2010-01-09T16:47:00.000Z	Guest85475	oCean_	No big deal. It isn't worth this much time to get mediawiki working, I'll just stick to org-mode for now. Thanks!
2010-01-09T16:48:00.000Z	oCean_	Guest85475	ah, well :)
2010-01-09T16:51:00.000Z	Guest85475	oCean_	oddly, the apt-gotten mediawiki works now. :) Go figure
2010-01-09T16:52:00.000Z	oCean_	Guest85475	hm? As where the aptitude installed mw failed?
2010-01-09T16:53:00.000Z	Guest85475	oCean_	Early on, I had the same problem with an aptitude'd mediawiki. Then I tried with ~/public_html/ same problem. Now I tried with the stock ubuntu one, and that works now. Must have been the php memory limit
2010-01-09T16:53:00.000Z	Guest85475	oCean_	sorry, I use apt-get and aptitude interchangeably to refer to software gotten from repos, not hand-installed
2010-01-09T16:53:00.000Z	oCean_	Guest85475	probably. Anyway: success!
2010-01-09T16:54:00.000Z	Guest85475	oCean_	yes. Lovely. Thanks again for your time
2010-01-09T16:54:00.000Z	oCean_	Guest85475	no prob.
