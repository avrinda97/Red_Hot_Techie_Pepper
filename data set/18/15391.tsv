2005-07-27T07:15:00.000Z	imcsk8		i have a problem with openoffice, i can't see my printer
2005-07-27T07:15:00.000Z	jasoncohen	imcsk8	did you add your printer in system > administration > printing?
2005-07-27T07:16:00.000Z	jasoncohen	imcsk8	so you added your printer and firefox/mozilla shows it by openoffice doesn't? did you restart OO after adding the printer?
2005-07-27T07:17:00.000Z	imcsk8	jasoncohen	yes i even restarted the machine
2005-07-27T07:18:00.000Z	jasoncohen	imcsk8	go to system > administration > printing
2005-07-27T07:18:00.000Z	imcsk8	jasoncohen	(by the way i'm using hoary on AMD64) yes i can see it
2005-07-27T07:18:00.000Z	jasoncohen	imcsk8	what's the printer?
2005-07-27T07:21:00.000Z	imcsk8	jasoncohen	, it's a network printer, i'm sure it's working because i just printed a test page
2005-07-27T07:21:00.000Z	jasoncohen	imcsk8	and the only program it doesn't work with is OO?
2005-07-27T07:21:00.000Z	imcsk8	jasoncohen	yes
2005-07-27T07:22:00.000Z	jasoncohen	imcsk8	what printer?
2005-07-27T07:22:00.000Z	jasoncohen	imcsk8	OO shows my networked Epson stylus C84 fine
2005-07-27T07:23:00.000Z	imcsk8	jasoncohen	hp inkjet 1100
2005-07-27T07:23:00.000Z	imcsk8	jasoncohen	the generic printer does not print
2005-07-27T07:24:00.000Z	jasoncohen	imcsk8	i don't know what to tell you...sorry
2005-07-27T07:24:00.000Z	jasoncohen	imcsk8	the amd64 openoffice is just compiled for 32 bit mode- so it's really like i386
2005-07-27T07:25:00.000Z	imcsk8	jasoncohen	don't worry i have like an hour or so looking through the ubuntu forums
2005-07-27T07:26:00.000Z	jasoncohen	imcsk8	this is a shot in the dark but do you get the same problem with OO2?
