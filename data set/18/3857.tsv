2009-07-18T06:52:00.000Z	jander991	skyeee	 How many hard drives do you have in your system?
2009-07-18T06:53:00.000Z	skyeee	jander991	two, but only one of them has operating systems installed
2009-07-18T06:53:00.000Z	jander991	skyeee	 Do you remember, when installing Ubuntu if you saw options for 'Grub'?  Its possible Grub loaded the bootloader on the wrong drive (your data drive not your OS drive).
2009-07-18T06:55:00.000Z	skyeee	jander991	i don't recall seeing anything for grub, but there is a grub folder in my linux install (have it booted to live cd)
2009-07-18T06:58:00.000Z	skyeee	jander991	should i be looking somewhere to specify where to install grub during startup?
2009-07-18T06:58:00.000Z	skyeee	jander991	i mean, during install <<
2009-07-18T06:59:00.000Z	jander991	skyeee	Technically it should install on the first hd of the system.  Thats the default anyway.  Right before the final "Install" button, there should be a summary display of all the settings.
2009-07-18T07:00:00.000Z	skyeee	jander991	i'm currently on here with my eee pc, so i won't be going anywhere :3
2009-07-18T07:01:00.000Z	jander991	skyeee	ok, I am though, pizza time!
2009-07-18T07:21:00.000Z	jander991	skyeee	How is the install coming?
2009-07-18T07:22:00.000Z	skyeee	jander991	got slightly distracted, and then went and cleared out those partitions, just booting up to the live cd again to intall it now
2009-07-18T07:22:00.000Z	jander991	skyeee	Too many shinies around? Oooh shiny...
2009-07-18T07:22:00.000Z	skyeee	jander991	you have no idea... (was also distracted telling my friend how the infected mushroom concert was last night)
2009-07-18T07:26:00.000Z	jander991	skyeee	heh. Once you get to the point of almost having it install the system, there should be a way to view a summary of the installation. Let me know when you get there.
2009-07-18T07:33:00.000Z	jander991	skyeee	Okay, good.  You should be able to choose where to install grub.  Are there only two choices? (For the two drives you have)
