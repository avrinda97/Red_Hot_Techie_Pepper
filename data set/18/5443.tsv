2008-11-06T08:11:00.000Z	LF|Irssi_		This might be poor advice, prolly get massive flames from it, but i fixed my audio in 8.10 by uninstalling PulseAudio server and just enabled ALSA *hides*
2008-11-06T08:11:00.000Z	nintendork87	jrib	it does the commands automaticly, like ubottu
2008-11-06T08:13:00.000Z	nintendork87	jrib	nothing except compile it if i updated the bot
