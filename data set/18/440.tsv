2012-02-17T02:42:00.000Z	meskarune	mputtr	read some command line cheat sheets and read wiki articles adn man pages
2012-02-17T02:42:00.000Z	mputtr		or should i just google it
2012-02-17T02:42:00.000Z	mputtr		command line cheat sheets... ok. let me look it up
2012-02-17T02:43:00.000Z	meskarune	mputtr	to learn more about a program in linux you can type "man <program>" and you'll get the manual on it. try doing "man cd"
2012-02-17T02:43:00.000Z	meskarune	mputtr	to exit out of the manual you hit the q key
2012-02-17T02:43:00.000Z	mputtr		one sec.. gotta go put sutff in the dryer
