2007-06-10T12:41:00.000Z	Flannel	Gekkko	that won't really work, as we're potentially all on different ubuntu versions.  What info are you looking for?
2007-06-10T12:41:00.000Z	Gekkko		i dont care what version of Ubuntu you're on
2007-06-10T12:41:00.000Z	Gekkko		lol
2007-06-10T12:41:00.000Z	Gekkko		as long as you're on an ubuntu
2007-06-10T12:41:00.000Z	Gekkko		i just wanna know the output
2007-06-10T12:41:00.000Z	Gekkko		i have my reasons, but I can't get into my Ubuntu right now to find out >_>
2007-06-10T12:42:00.000Z	Gekkko	gordboy	it says Ubuntu's sh is dash, not bash
2007-06-10T12:42:00.000Z	Gekkko		I think i just proved that theory
2007-06-10T12:42:00.000Z	Gekkko		it = wikipedia.
2007-06-10T12:43:00.000Z	Flannel	Gekkko	no, that's simply not correct.
2007-06-10T12:43:00.000Z	Gekkko		really?
2007-06-10T12:44:00.000Z	Flannel	Gekkko	Ubuntu 6.10 and later use dash as the default script handler, but "sh" isn't dash.  Its just a symlink to any scripter.
2007-06-10T12:44:00.000Z	Gekkko		dash is a modern replacement for ash in the Debian project, and (as of the 6.10 release) is the default /bin/sh in Ubuntu. However, the transition in Ubuntu to making dash /bin/sh has broken numerous shell scripts that relied upon bash-specific functionality, also known as bashisms.
2007-06-10T12:44:00.000Z	Gekkko		lol
2007-06-10T12:44:00.000Z	Gekkko		I was right Frogzoo_?
2007-06-10T12:45:00.000Z	Flannel	Gekkko	Right.  Those scripts WERENT shell scripts, they were bash scripts.  It's not Ubuntu breaking those scripts, it's the writers of those scripts being stupid and not reporting their requirements properly. (shebang should point to bash not sh)
