2004-09-14T10:23:00.000Z	jdub		yeah
2004-09-14T10:23:00.000Z	jdub		that'd be rad
2004-09-14T10:24:00.000Z	jdub		pretty much, with gnome-volume-manager
2004-09-14T10:24:00.000Z	jdub		i don't think anyone would have an issue with further use
2004-09-14T10:24:00.000Z	jdub		MEATY HAL!
2004-09-14T10:24:00.000Z	jdub		except the solaris guys

2004-09-14T10:24:00.000Z	mdz_	jdub	...and it has to work on Solaris, too
2004-09-14T10:24:00.000Z	mdz_	jdub	just kidding!
2004-09-14T10:27:00.000Z	mdz_	jdub	not sure I like the red in the disabled mode; did you already say you were changing that?
2004-09-14T10:27:00.000Z	jdub	mdz_	yeah
2004-09-14T10:28:00.000Z	jdub	mdz_	i can't just be grey, because 'no link' is also grey ;)
2004-09-14T10:28:00.000Z	mdz_	jdub	this stuff doesn't seem to be built in Warty yet, so I can't see it here
