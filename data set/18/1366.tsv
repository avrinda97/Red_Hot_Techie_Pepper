2011-05-05T00:25:00.000Z	tjiggi_fo	ablaze	there's actually a warning on the wubi page about a problem upgrading from 10.04 to 10.10: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/WubiGuide
2011-05-05T00:26:00.000Z	ablaze	tjiggi_fo	i have fixed the grub problem ::: now it's not the grub problem but after that it stucks on this screen
2011-05-05T00:26:00.000Z	tjiggi_fo	ablaze	best is to uninstall wubi from windows (instructions in the link above) and reinstall 10.10
2011-05-05T00:27:00.000Z	tjiggi_fo	ablaze	understood, but it breaks more than just grub
2011-05-05T00:28:00.000Z	ablaze	tjiggi_fo	i just read the megathread link given in your site ::: and i used their method to restore grub menu ::: but now it's not working ::: after that ::: when i use a generic, after that it stucks on purple screen ::: but recovery mode is working
2011-05-05T00:31:00.000Z	tjiggi_fo	ablaze	I understand where it gets stuck, but I have no idea how to solve that. You might look in your log file viewer at messages and boot to see if there are any clues
2011-05-05T00:32:00.000Z	ablaze	tjiggi_fo	i tried to remove "quiet splash" ::: should i try this and give u some information which could be helpful???
2011-05-05T00:32:00.000Z	tjiggi_fo	ablaze	the problem with using wubi is that not many people here use it, so not many know how to fix it :)
2011-05-05T00:33:00.000Z	ablaze	tjiggi_fo	it's true ::: well ::: where i can see log viewer???
2011-05-05T00:33:00.000Z	tjiggi_fo	ablaze	System, Administration
2011-05-05T00:34:00.000Z	ablaze	tjiggi_fo	but i m not able to start ubuntu :( :::
2011-05-05T00:34:00.000Z	tjiggi_fo	ablaze	do you have a live CD?
2011-05-05T00:35:00.000Z	ablaze	tjiggi_fo	yes i have a live USB
2011-05-05T00:36:00.000Z	tjiggi_fo	ablaze	boot up into a live session and look for the wubi install in Program Files (or wherever) and the logs will be in /var/log/messages and /var/log/boot. use the date and time to try find when your first problem boot happened
2011-05-05T00:38:00.000Z	ablaze	tjiggi_fo	ok ::: thanx ::: i m giving this a try ::: and i will tell u the results, if i found ::: thanx again
2011-05-05T00:38:00.000Z	tjiggi_fo	ablaze	:)
2011-05-05T00:50:00.000Z	ablaze	tjiggi_fo	i will find the log and boot files in system folder of my live session's system file or it should be elsewhere ::: because i m not able to find this in my system except in live session's sytem files :::
2011-05-05T00:52:00.000Z	tjiggi_fo	ablaze	if you go to Places, Computer you should find a "FileSystem" entry (NTFS) that includes your windows files
