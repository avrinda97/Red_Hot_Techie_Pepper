2008-02-12T03:43:00.000Z	bobbob1016		In gedit, how would I find and replace a csv file (comma seperated value), so I can remove the 2nd-4th values and the last value in a file?  The file is basically YEAR-MONTH-DAY,deletenumber1,deletenumber2,deletenumber3,keepnumber4,deletenumber5 I want to delete everything starting with delete
2008-02-12T03:45:00.000Z	danand_	bobbob1016	- don't use gedit for that type of thing - use a shell script - try looking at ways of doing it with awk or the cut command
2008-02-12T03:46:00.000Z	danand_	bobbob1016	- ie cat file | cut --delimiter=, --fields=1,2 should print the first two values to std output
2008-02-12T03:48:00.000Z	bobbob1016	danand_	Oh, ok, so I'd basically do "cat file.csv | cut --delimiter=, --fields=1,4" would give me the 1st and 4th lines?
2008-02-12T03:49:00.000Z	danand_	bobbob1016	- yes. For more advanced stuff like that look at using awk or sed!
2008-02-12T03:49:00.000Z	bobbob1016	danand_	What command would save that back to a file?
2008-02-12T03:49:00.000Z	danand_	bobbob1016	- cut command should be ok for that though :)
2008-02-12T03:50:00.000Z	danand_	bobbob1016	- cat file.csv | cut
2008-02-12T03:50:00.000Z	bobbob1016	danand_	Oh, so it saves it to the file I opened, right?
2008-02-12T03:50:00.000Z	danand_	bobbob1016	- cat file | cut .... > newfile.txt
2008-02-12T03:52:00.000Z	danand_	bobbob1016	- sorry about previous to last ... use cat ... etc > newfile.txt This will output the result of that command to "newfile.txt"
2008-02-12T03:52:00.000Z	bobbob1016	danand_	So "cat file.csv | cut --delimiter=, --fields=1,4 etc > newfile.txt"
2008-02-12T03:53:00.000Z	danand_	bobbob1016	- yes, thats it :)
2008-02-12T03:55:00.000Z	bobbob1016	danand_	Thanks, trying that now
2008-02-12T03:58:00.000Z	bobbob1016	danand_	Thanks, that worked.  Surprisingly fast too, I thought I'd have a second or two to wait, since it is a few thousand lines, but I underestimated my computer.
2008-02-12T03:58:00.000Z	danand_	bobbob1016	- glad to help
2008-02-12T03:59:00.000Z	bobbob1016	danand_	I still have to do the C# code behind it though...  that's the fun part...
2008-02-12T04:00:00.000Z	danand_	bobbob1016	- C# - oh oh !! :)
