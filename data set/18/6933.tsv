2008-05-02T12:35:00.000Z	Viper111	ikonia	i need to go throuogh internet and browse shared folders usng VPn but its not working
2008-05-02T12:35:00.000Z	ikonia	Viper111	you will do as your vpn'd onto another network so your tunneled off the network
2008-05-02T12:36:00.000Z	Viper111	ikonia	i didnt get wat you mean
2008-05-02T12:36:00.000Z	ikonia	Viper111	one you open a VPN, your tunneled onto that network, so if that network doesn't have internet access, you won't get onto the internet
2008-05-02T12:36:00.000Z	Viper111	ikonia	ok thts gd, how can i make my VPN connection when dialed go through internet
2008-05-02T12:37:00.000Z	ikonia	Viper111	you can make a vpn connection, over the internet over any connection, as long as you are connected to the internet access
2008-05-02T12:39:00.000Z	Viper111	ikonia	i have a ubuntu server that has internet access + squid server, i made a vpn connection, but when i dial it i llose internet connectivity on my pc's
2008-05-02T12:39:00.000Z	ikonia	Viper111	yes, as I explained you will do, once your server is cnnected to the VPN, you will drop off your public connection as it's on the vpn networ
2008-05-02T12:40:00.000Z	ikonia	Viper111	you'll need to setup routing, but I don't think your understanding, once your server is connected to the VPN, it will not be on your local network
2008-05-02T12:41:00.000Z	ikonia	Viper111	that depends on your nework
2008-05-02T12:41:00.000Z	Viper111	ikonia	i have a real IP on one NIC and face on other
2008-05-02T12:42:00.000Z	ikonia	Viper111	thats not enough information
2008-05-02T12:42:00.000Z	Viper111	ikonia	tell me wat do u need
2008-05-02T12:43:00.000Z	ikonia	Viper111	I'm not going to help you design routing for your network, you need to get a basic understanding of routing
