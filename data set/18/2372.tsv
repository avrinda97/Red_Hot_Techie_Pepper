2010-06-02T11:52:00.000Z	Theo		Anyone help me with my external hard drive? It's plugged in and hasn't automounted, and the process of manually mounting it has confused me
2010-06-02T11:53:00.000Z	bullgard4	Theo	An icon should normally appear on your desktop. Check to see if you can find the name of your USB hard disk in Nautilus.
2010-06-02T11:55:00.000Z	bullgard4	Theo	Yes, in Nautilus.
2010-06-02T11:58:00.000Z	Theo	bullgard4	no luck
2010-06-02T12:03:00.000Z	bullgard4	Theo	Please nopaste the output of '~$ df -h' when your USB hard disk is inserted.

2010-06-02T12:10:00.000Z	bullgard4	Theo	Your USB hard disk is not mounted.
2010-06-02T12:11:00.000Z	Theo	bullgard4	Yes, I was hoping to get help with that
2010-06-02T12:11:00.000Z	bullgard4	Theo	Please nopaste the output of '~$ lsusb'.

2010-06-02T12:15:00.000Z	bullgard4	Theo	Please do the same after having unplugged your USB hard drive.

2010-06-02T12:19:00.000Z	bullgard4	Theo	So your kernel's USB subsystem recognizes your hard drive as "Seagate RSS LLC".  -- Now you need to mount this hard drive.
2010-06-02T12:19:00.000Z	Theo	bullgard4	Ok, so I'm guessing I'm gonna want to replug it...then what?
2010-06-02T12:21:00.000Z	bullgard4	Theo	Yes. Please re-plug it. Then look in Nautilus if you can find a device /dev/sdb or similar.
2010-06-02T12:24:00.000Z	Theo	bullgard4	There is no "sdb", but there is "shm" and "snd"
2010-06-02T12:25:00.000Z	bullgard4	Theo	"snd" stands for "sound" and is not what we want. --  Let me see what shm stands for.
2010-06-02T12:27:00.000Z	bullgard4	Theo	"shm" probably stands for "shared memory" and is nto what we want either.
