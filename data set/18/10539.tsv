2008-06-01T19:32:00.000Z	Slart	smallfoot-	stop that..
2008-06-01T19:34:00.000Z	Slart	smallfoot-	new stuff isn't always cool
2008-06-01T19:34:00.000Z	Slart	smallfoot-	then you'll have to learn how to handle stuff like this..
2008-06-01T19:35:00.000Z	Slart	smallfoot-	without running around shouting like the world is going to end for every error message
2008-07-21T23:09:00.000Z	Slart	smallfoot-	of coure you meant to paste that in the !ot channel.. or course you did
2008-07-21T23:12:00.000Z	smallfoot-	Slart	im banned from there
2008-07-21T23:13:00.000Z	Slart	smallfoot-	hmm.. and still you paste !ot links in the support channel..
2008-07-21T23:13:00.000Z	smallfoot-	Slart	ya
2010-01-27T01:18:00.000Z	Slart	smallfoot-	there are several nvidia drivers.. at least 3 different versions for different ages of graphics cards.
2010-01-27T01:18:00.000Z	smallfoot-	Slart	i know. the 8.10 release notes, seems to say i will have to use free drivers...
2010-01-27T01:18:00.000Z	smallfoot-	Slart	unless that was fixed again later..
2010-01-27T01:18:00.000Z	Slart	smallfoot-	hmm.. that sounds weird..
2010-01-27T01:19:00.000Z	smallfoot-	Slart	ya
2010-01-27T01:19:00.000Z	Slart	smallfoot-	http://www.nvidia.com/object/solaris_display_96.43.14.html   here it mentions cards as old as Geforce 2
2010-01-27T01:19:00.000Z	Slart	smallfoot-	I would try installing it.. and if it doesn't offer to install the binary driver for you just download the one from nvidias site
2010-01-27T01:21:00.000Z	Slart	smallfoot-	ahh.. perhaps the nvidia driver isn't compatible with the new Xorg they included in 8.10
