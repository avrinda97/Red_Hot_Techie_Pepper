2010-05-09T18:26:00.000Z	martez89		how can i edit files on my installed ubuntu from a live cd? normally i used
2010-05-09T18:26:00.000Z	martez89		gksu gedit /etc/default/grub for instance. but what path should i use now to edit the files?
2010-05-09T18:27:00.000Z	martez89		i installed ubuntu on an empty pc
2010-05-09T18:27:00.000Z	Stormcr0w	martez89	there is a disk utility under system - administration which will show you the path to each hard drive
2010-05-09T18:28:00.000Z	Stormcr0w	martez89	If your pc is empty, then there are no files on it, which renders your question moot?
2010-05-09T18:29:00.000Z	martez89		no thats not what i mean, i installed ubuntu on an empty pc. but now that wont boot anymore because of this http://news.softpedia.com/news/How-to-Fix-the-Big-and-Ugly-Plymouth-Logo-in-Ubuntu-10-04-140810.shtml. now i am trying to fix it from a live cd
2010-05-09T18:29:00.000Z	martez89	pallgone	yes
2010-05-09T18:31:00.000Z	martez89		its mounted now
2010-05-09T18:32:00.000Z	martez89		its says location: computer:///
2010-05-09T18:33:00.000Z	martez89		and in the disk utility it says: /dev/sda1
2010-05-09T18:34:00.000Z	Stormcr0w	martez89	if you double-click the disk on the desktop, it will automount it
2010-05-09T18:35:00.000Z	martez89	pallgone	/dev/sda1 on /media/7ce44f4d-582f-4797-98b2-1e0f2c7e8818 type ext4 (rw,nosuid,nodev,uhelper=devkit)
2010-05-09T18:35:00.000Z	Stormcr0w	martez89	following that, you will have it under /media/..., just as you have already found it
2010-05-09T18:36:00.000Z	Stormcr0w	martez89	now you can browse through it this way: cd /media/....
2010-05-09T18:36:00.000Z	martez89		stromcr0w: how should this command then be? gksu gedit /etc/default/grub
2010-05-09T18:37:00.000Z	Stormcr0w	martez89	gksu gedit /media/.../etc/default/grub
2010-05-09T18:37:00.000Z	martez89		yeah it seems to work now, thanks both :)
2010-05-09T18:38:00.000Z	Stormcr0w	martez89	anytime
