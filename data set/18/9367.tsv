2007-05-13T10:07:00.000Z	eternalswd		can anyone give me a hand setting up feisty as a gateway for my xp machine?  Here's my setup, I have my Ubuntu box connected via a wireless router ip of 192.168.1.1 with the wireless ip for my box being 192.168.1.2 and I have a crossover connection between the ubuntu box and my xp box with ubuntu ip 192.168.0.1 and xp ip 192.168.0.2  I just set net.ipv4.ip_forward to 1 via sysctl and put in 192.168.0.1 as the gateway address on xp
2007-05-13T10:07:00.000Z	eternalswd		.  I'm not sure where to go from there
2007-05-13T10:09:00.000Z	IowaDave	eternalswd	you are thinking that the ubuntu machine will simply share internet connection with the windows box? or are you thinking you need to have the ubuntu serve as a firewall?
2007-05-13T10:10:00.000Z	eternalswd	IowaDave	I simply want it to share the net connection with the windows box
2007-05-13T10:11:00.000Z	IowaDave	eternalswd	understood. it's something that Macs and Windows XP machines can be configured to do, so why not Ubuntu, right? i'll flip through a book and see what I can find. anybody else, feel free to chime in.
2007-05-13T10:14:00.000Z	IowaDave	eternalswd	found this --- http://www.debuntu.org/iptables-how-to-share-your-internet-connection
2007-05-13T10:15:00.000Z	IowaDave	eternalswd	not a trivial task, but not impossible, to share your connection. look at it this way: after you get it going, you'll be the new expert on the subject :-P
2007-05-13T10:16:00.000Z	eternalswd		thanks IowaDave and rob_p, I should be able to get it from there
2007-05-13T10:17:00.000Z	IowaDave		zcat: sounds like you know more than I do. thanks for the suggestion, anyhow. :)
2007-05-13T10:20:00.000Z	IowaDave	eternalswd	zcat: firestarter is available in Synaptic (not sure which repository). more information is available online, just google firestarter. looks simple enough, he said, without having tried it.
2007-05-13T10:21:00.000Z	IowaDave		zcat, thanks. eternalswd, you'll need to turn on the universe repository so that synaptic can install firestarter for you.
2007-05-13T10:22:00.000Z	IowaDave		zcat: tell it
2007-05-13T10:23:00.000Z	eternalswd	IowaDave	I'm familiar with firestarter, but I'd actually prefer doing it without gui first in any case, especially since I'll likely be setting up a dedicated server sometime in the near future
2007-05-13T10:24:00.000Z	IowaDave	eternalswd	ok, that puts you back onto iptables, and the link I sent you the first time. good luck!
2007-05-13T10:25:00.000Z	eternalswd	IowaDave	zcat[1]  actually rob_p pointed me to ubuntu-firewall which I think will work nicely
2007-05-13T10:25:00.000Z	eternalswd		why make things more complicated than they need to be ;)
2007-05-13T10:26:00.000Z	IowaDave	eternalswd	remember if all else fails, buy a cheap wireless card for that Windows machine. it's cheaper than tearing out your hair. :-/
2007-05-13T10:27:00.000Z	eternalswd	IowaDave	yes, but that doesn't look as good on a resume :p
