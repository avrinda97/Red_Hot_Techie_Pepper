2012-03-02T06:43:00.000Z	tripelb		I want to make a USB boot drive WITHOUT WINDOWS, and the directions are using windows afaik
2012-03-02T06:43:00.000Z	dustmonkey	tripelb	aka no unetbootin?
2012-03-02T06:44:00.000Z	dustmonkey	tripelb	simply boot a live CD and create your USB there
2012-03-02T06:45:00.000Z	dustmonkey	tripelb	OR go to a mac store and do it
2012-03-02T06:45:00.000Z	tripelb	dustmonkey	sounds simple. How?  .. I dont care what version of ubuntu I use 9, 10 or 11.04 ... From 10.10 there is no longer a usb-creator package
2012-03-02T06:45:00.000Z	dustmonkey	tripelb	both answers use no windows
2012-03-02T06:45:00.000Z	tripelb	dustmonkey	I dont understand about the mac store
2012-03-02T06:46:00.000Z	dustmonkey	tripelb	install the unetbootin package that will do it for you
2012-03-02T06:46:00.000Z	dustmonkey	tripelb	as for the mac store, well that was a silly joke, you could use one of there machines and get into bash and do it there
2012-03-02T06:47:00.000Z	tripelb	dustmonkey	cfHowlett, ok help me. I have a mac right here I am on it. I can get into terminal. this sounds grand.
2012-03-02T06:48:00.000Z	dustmonkey	tripelb	sounds like you need to google unetbootin
2012-03-02T06:48:00.000Z	dustmonkey	tripelb	they have a Mac package for creating live USB distros
2012-03-02T06:48:00.000Z	dustmonkey	tripelb	should be a sourceforge page
2012-03-02T06:48:00.000Z	tripelb	dustmonkey	cfHowlett, --- I see this on the FromUSBStick webpage sudo apt-get install usb-creator-gtk or usb-creator-kde ---- OK I will google that. Maybe that's what I need to know.
2012-03-02T06:49:00.000Z	dustmonkey	tripelb	that will be the easiest way to accomplish what you are looking for
2012-03-02T06:50:00.000Z	tripelb	dustmonkey	cfHowlett, --- thanks. reading this. http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/
2012-03-02T06:50:00.000Z	dustmonkey	tripelb	rock on!
2012-03-02T06:55:00.000Z	tripelb	dustmonkey	right about entering things I am unsure of. and unetbootin looks awesome.
