2011-06-08T06:19:00.000Z	RevSpecies116		Unity is here to stay - the best thing to happen to Ubuntu in a while
2011-06-08T06:19:00.000Z	nykur	RevSpecies116	I'm afraid my netbook won't let me
2011-06-08T06:21:00.000Z	RevSpecies116	nykur	You missed a Jono Bacon talk about Unity about 4 hours ago. If you feel it is a bug, launchpad would be the place to raise it.
2011-06-08T06:22:00.000Z	RevSpecies116	nykur	There are no easy configuration options for Unity at the moment
2011-06-08T06:23:00.000Z	RevSpecies116	nykur	By 12.04LTS, it should be perfect
2011-06-08T06:24:00.000Z	nykur	RevSpecies116	I'm sure, but for now I'll see if there is a way to scroll behind the indicators.
2011-06-08T06:25:00.000Z	RevSpecies116	nykur	Don't give up on that option, though - Jono says that not all changes to Unity have to wait for 11.10, they are being activly backported to 11.04 Unity too
2011-06-08T15:52:00.000Z	RevSpecies116	nykur	#ayatana
2011-06-08T15:52:00.000Z	RevSpecies116	nykur	That channel will specifically help with Unity issues
2011-06-08T15:52:00.000Z	nykur	RevSpecies116	Many thanks!
2011-06-08T15:53:00.000Z	nykur	RevSpecies116	I know, probably not. Unless I'm very lucky;-)
2011-06-08T15:55:00.000Z	nykur	RevSpecies116	Like I said yesterday, I wouldn't consider this a bug, unless there really isn't a way around it.
2011-06-08T15:56:00.000Z	RevSpecies116	nykur	Jono Bacon would disagree :) Speaking of Jono, #ubuntu-desktop is also a channel that will help with Unity design flaws and issues :)
2011-06-08T15:58:00.000Z	nykur	RevSpecies116	If this is really a design flaw, I'll be sure to tell mr. Bacon about it. But I just don't feel comfortable raising bug reports on software I don't know very well and haven't tested extensively. But thanks for redirecting me, and I'll see what they say.
2011-06-08T16:03:00.000Z	nykur	RevSpecies116	I know, he's a household name in these parts, as he should. If my issue will help further Unity, I'll be glad to have helped... a little :-)
2011-06-08T16:03:00.000Z	RevSpecies116	nykur	and I will thank you also - I want Unity to be perfect when 12.04LTS comes around :)
2011-06-08T16:07:00.000Z	nykur	RevSpecies116	Hehe thanks! I'm all for making things move forward, and who knows if Unity WILL be perfect, I just might add it to my main Debian box, in due time:-) But for now I'm rather pleased with it on my netbook, apart from this little annoyance. But of course we don't settle for less than perfect, then we might as well run... (finish this sentence silently;-)
