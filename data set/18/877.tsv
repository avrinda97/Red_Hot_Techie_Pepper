2011-08-08T04:30:00.000Z	urlin2u	Arengorn	what is the image?
2011-08-08T04:31:00.000Z	urlin2u	Arengorn	I don't think that is installable it runs in ram, burn it to a cd to use it or load a thmb
2011-08-08T04:33:00.000Z	urlin2u	Arengorn	from the pm page.  Parted Magic - LiveCD/USB with it's only purpose being partitioning hard drives.
2011-08-08T04:33:00.000Z	urlin2u	Arengorn	burn it to a cd.
2011-08-08T04:36:00.000Z	urlin2u	Arengorn	what do you want to do with partmagic?
2011-08-08T04:38:00.000Z	urlin2u	Arengorn	then you want to burn the ISO to a cd, or load a thumb with like unetbootin, so you can boot partmagic and use it.
2011-08-08T04:39:00.000Z	urlin2u	Arengorn	a regular ubuntu live cd has gparted on it same as partmagic.
2011-08-08T04:41:00.000Z	urlin2u	Arengorn	you have to boot a partitoner like the two mentioned here to change the partitions on the hd.
2011-08-08T04:42:00.000Z	urlin2u	Arengorn	your leaving out a bit of information, such as where and where and what your doing and with what.
2011-08-08T04:45:00.000Z	urlin2u	Arengorn	can gparted even see the external, and thanks for clarifying that. ;)
2011-08-08T04:45:00.000Z	urlin2u	Arengorn	so when you right click the partition on the external you have no delete option.
2011-08-08T04:56:00.000Z	urlin2u	Arengorn	sudo is your best route.
2011-08-08T05:00:00.000Z	urlin2u	Arengorn	take a screen shot of that HD in gparted, and image n=bin it.
2011-08-08T05:03:00.000Z	urlin2u	Arengorn	post the image, I don't take images that way.  http://imagebin.org/index.php?page=add
2011-08-08T05:14:00.000Z	urlin2u	Arengorn	can you right click the one unidetified partition and delete?
2011-08-08T05:16:00.000Z	urlin2u	Arengorn	when mounted the fat shows, but I think you have overlapping partitions, pull off what you ned then unmount it and delete .
2011-08-08T05:16:00.000Z	urlin2u	Arengorn	how what?
