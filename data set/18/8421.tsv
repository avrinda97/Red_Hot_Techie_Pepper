2007-08-24T16:44:00.000Z	cweagans	Stimulus_solutio	what are you trying to do?
2007-08-24T16:45:00.000Z	cweagans	Stimulus_solutio	 tell them to install hamachi and join your network. then have them run the vnc server and you can connect.
2007-08-24T16:46:00.000Z	Stimulus_solutio	cweagans	whats himachi?
2007-08-24T16:46:00.000Z	cweagans	Stimulus_solutio	hamachi is a free vpn tool....http://www.hamachi.cc
2007-08-24T16:47:00.000Z	cweagans	Stimulus_solutio	no....not router firewalls. They will still have to allow it on their machine (windows firewall, iptables, etc.)
2007-08-24T16:47:00.000Z	cweagans	Stimulus_solutio	there are also web solutions....try www.logmein.com if you get hung up on hamachi
