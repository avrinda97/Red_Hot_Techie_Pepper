2010-04-05T03:21:00.000Z	rshakin		i am having some serious issues with my linux install
2010-04-05T03:22:00.000Z	rshakin		i''ve installed 9.10 on my spare box, and my ethernet controller dont work and this is a slimline  box so i cannot use a different card
2010-04-05T03:22:00.000Z	rshakin		i have a rtl8111c chipset
2010-04-05T03:22:00.000Z	rshakin		any ideas ?
2010-04-05T03:23:00.000Z	rshakin		no it;s not its wired
2010-04-05T03:23:00.000Z	erUSUL	rshakin	should work with the r8169 module
2010-04-05T03:24:00.000Z	erUSUL	rshakin	sudo modprobe r8169 && dmesg | tail
2010-04-05T03:25:00.000Z	rshakin	erUSUL	it shows up as loaded in the ifconfig module already loaded for it
2010-04-05T03:26:00.000Z	erUSUL	rshakin	and in the « ifconfig » there is no eth0 ?
2010-04-05T03:26:00.000Z	rshakin	erUSUL	there is a eth0 but nothing happens when i do bring it up and down, it wont get an ip
2010-04-05T03:27:00.000Z	erUSUL	rshakin	« sudo dhclient eth0 »  what error you get? (if any)
2010-04-05T03:28:00.000Z	rshakin	erUSUL	i don't get anything as far as error for that.. it just times out
2010-04-05T03:29:00.000Z	erUSUL	rshakin	and you are sure there is a dhcserver in the lan ? maybe you have to use static ip ?
2010-04-05T03:29:00.000Z	rshakin	erUSUL	dmesg is ok too... i know it's not cable or anything like that i've checked
2010-04-05T03:29:00.000Z	rshakin	erUSUL	there is a dhcp server... and it is working cause i've just reset everything on my pc and mac
2010-04-05T03:30:00.000Z	erUSUL	rshakin	sure the iface is up? « sudo ifconfig eth0 up && sudo dhclient eth0 »
2010-04-05T03:31:00.000Z	rshakin	erUSUL	i will check brb
