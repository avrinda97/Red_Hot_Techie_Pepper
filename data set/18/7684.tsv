2008-08-05T10:47:00.000Z	qinjuehang		﻿bmarley13: is your Ubuntu out-of-the-box
2008-08-05T10:47:00.000Z	qinjuehang		﻿chelz: Actually, if you are really, um...determined, just use 64-bit GCC and kernel
2008-08-05T10:48:00.000Z	qinjuehang		I think you need to trick apt somehow to use 64-bit repos before doing that
2008-08-05T10:48:00.000Z	wols	qinjuehang	apt certainly won't do it. you'd need a LOT of dpkg --force stuff and most likely you will screw up beyond hope
2008-08-05T10:58:00.000Z	wols	qinjuehang	huh?
2008-08-05T10:58:00.000Z	wols	qinjuehang	AC97 is more than sound...
2008-08-05T10:59:00.000Z	wols	qinjuehang	if anything, connexant
2008-08-05T11:03:00.000Z	wols	qinjuehang	costs more too afaik
2008-08-05T11:06:00.000Z	wols	qinjuehang	800gt is faster than 9600gt. 20k fillrate vs 33k for the 8800gt
2008-08-05T11:07:00.000Z	wols	qinjuehang	lower clocked and half the stream processors too.
2008-08-05T11:07:00.000Z	qinjuehang	wols	if you trust 3Dmark, I get 15k score.
2008-08-05T11:07:00.000Z	wols	qinjuehang	I trust clockspeed and numbers of shaders
2008-08-05T11:08:00.000Z	wols	qinjuehang	your card has 2/3 of the fillrate
2008-08-05T11:09:00.000Z	wols	qinjuehang	http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/nvidia-geforce-9600-gt,1780-3.html 8800gt uses g92, yours is a g94
2008-08-05T11:11:00.000Z	wols	qinjuehang	109EUR vs 129EUR. not really ahlf :)
2008-08-05T11:12:00.000Z	qinjuehang	wols	It is half where I live...anyway, 8800 has a lower clock speed
2008-08-05T11:13:00.000Z	qinjuehang	wols	and, a 9800GTX + is the sweet point now, it's soooo cheap
