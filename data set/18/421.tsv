2012-05-20T04:30:00.000Z	alexhairyman		is there a command to force quit a window in 12.04?
2012-05-20T04:31:00.000Z	L3top	alexhairyman	alt f4? right click on taskbar and quit... or drop to a termnial and get mean.
2012-08-01T22:22:00.000Z	L3top	alexhairyman	lsb_release -sc
2012-08-01T22:23:00.000Z	alexhairyman	L3top	?
2012-08-01T22:23:00.000Z	L3top	alexhairyman	type that into a terminal please
2012-08-01T22:25:00.000Z	L3top	alexhairyman	so you have installed 12.10.
2012-08-01T22:26:00.000Z	alexhairyman	L3top	how would that happen?
2012-08-01T22:27:00.000Z	L3top	alexhairyman	well... either you installed from a 1210 cd mistakenly, or you typed a very specific do-release upgrade command that allows you to upgrade to a beta distro?
2012-08-01T22:28:00.000Z	L3top	alexhairyman	^
2012-08-01T22:43:00.000Z	L3top	alexhairyman	do you have the option to hit either one from grub?
