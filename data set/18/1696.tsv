2010-12-23T18:13:00.000Z	juniour		can any tell me how to sniff in wifi
2010-12-23T18:15:00.000Z	juniour		hey can any one tell me to chat via terminal
2010-12-23T18:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	juniour	 i would say googling for some wifi docs on that topic would be the best bet.. its a rather clomplex topic.
2010-12-23T18:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	juniour	 there are IRC clients for the console.. irssi, and weechat are the 2 most popular
2010-12-23T18:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	juniour	 i reccomend weechat
2010-12-23T18:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	juniour	 a text based irc client.. like i said.. :)
2010-12-23T18:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	juniour	 then you proberly dont want to use telnet.. claify what it is you are trying to do exactly.
2010-12-23T18:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	juniour	 if you mwan you want to  use 'IRC' from a terminal.. then use irssi, or weechat.. install them both... try them out
2010-12-23T18:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	juniour	 and reead the weechat docs/guides also. :) they are well done
2010-12-23T18:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	juniour	 i doubt if you need telnet for much of anything these days
2010-12-23T18:24:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	juniour	 its apt-get, and thats how one nomrally installs packages.. or use the pacakge manager tools
2010-12-30T04:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	juniour	 i now the vbox homepage has a rather large manual on it.. and theres wiki and forum threads on using it..
2010-12-30T04:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	juniour	 ubuntu worked very well for me in vbox last i tried it..
2010-12-30T04:56:00.000Z	juniour	Dr_Willis	can u tell me the procedure
2010-12-30T04:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	juniour	 run vbox.. follow the wizards.. point it to the ubuntu.iso boot it.. follow installer directons...
2010-12-30T04:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	juniour	 theres not a lot to tell.
2010-12-30T04:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	juniour	 no.. vbox handles that.. you really should go read through the vbox docs...
