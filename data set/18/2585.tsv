2011-01-16T21:14:00.000Z	goodflood		I have vista/ubuntu dual boot problem
2011-01-16T21:15:00.000Z	goodflood		Hi Peetoon
2011-01-16T21:15:00.000Z	goodflood		I installed ubuntu ; it asked where do I want to install the boot loader (GRUB??) I said in the Windows partition
2011-01-16T21:16:00.000Z	goodflood		Now, I can't get into Vista...
2011-01-16T21:16:00.000Z	tgp1994	goodflood	Is the vista boot loader still on vista's partition?
2011-01-16T21:17:00.000Z	tgp1994	goodflood	Take a look on vista's partition, on the root of the driver, there should be a file named bootmgr
2011-01-16T21:17:00.000Z	tgp1994	goodflood	Make sure that's there.
2011-01-16T21:19:00.000Z	tgp1994	goodflood	No, that's not it. It should just be at the root of the drive there.
2011-01-16T21:21:00.000Z	tgp1994	goodflood	Yup, on my windows Vista hard drive, there's a file at the top named bootmgr. That's the vista boot loader. So you're not seeing it?
2011-01-16T21:22:00.000Z	tgp1994	goodflood	Drive/partition, whatever has your system on it.
2011-01-16T21:22:00.000Z	tgp1994	goodflood	Ok then, just the vista partition then.
2011-01-16T21:27:00.000Z	tgp1994	goodflood	So you have three partitions then?
2011-01-16T21:29:00.000Z	tgp1994	goodflood	So system-wise, there are two partitions, each with windows vista installed, and then another partition with ubuntu, correct?
2011-01-16T21:31:00.000Z	tgp1994	goodflood	And what version of ubuntu do you have?
2011-01-16T21:33:00.000Z	tgp1994	goodflood	Take a look at this tutorial: http://erickoo.wordpress.com/2009/06/14/how-to-add-vista-partition-to-grub-2-ubuntu-9-10-karmic-koala/
