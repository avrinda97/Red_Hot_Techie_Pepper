2007-10-21T03:23:00.000Z	Optimus55		hey i just installed wine from add/remove but how do i open it? there's no entry in the menus...
2007-10-21T03:24:00.000Z	pike_	Optimus55	you dont really open it. search for wine again in package manager and download xwine you can run that otherwise you just wine whatever.exe
2007-10-21T03:24:00.000Z	pike_	Optimus55	be sure to run 'winecfg' to configure it
2007-10-21T03:24:00.000Z	Optimus55	pike_	so download xwine then run winecfg?
2007-10-21T03:25:00.000Z	pike_	Optimus55	yeah. whichever order
2007-10-21T03:25:00.000Z	pike_	Optimus55	you dont need xwine but if you want a gui you do
2007-10-21T03:25:00.000Z	Optimus55	pike_	okay thanks. i'll get it. makes things easier
2007-10-21T03:28:00.000Z	Optimus55	pike_	where do i get xwine from tho? i'm not seeing it in either add/remove or synaptic
2007-10-21T03:30:00.000Z	pike_	Optimus55	sorry not sure ill check after my update is finished
2007-10-21T03:30:00.000Z	Optimus55	pike_	k just let me know when its done
2007-10-21T03:32:00.000Z	pike_	Optimus55	odd its in debian. sorry i assumed itd be in ubuntu repos
2007-10-21T03:35:00.000Z	pike_	Optimus55	try just clicking on the executables exe files should by default open with wine assuming the packager did a good job
2007-11-15T05:58:00.000Z	pike_	Optimus55	it is open by default
2007-11-15T05:58:00.000Z	pike_	Optimus55	sudo iptables -L to check but everything should be just accept unless youve installed firestarter or setup iptables yourself
2007-11-15T06:00:00.000Z	Optimus55	pike_	okay gona check. using thunderbird with hotmail extension but the 2 servers fail to start on ports 110 and 25
2007-11-15T06:00:00.000Z	Optimus55	pike_	yeah everything says accept.
2007-11-15T06:11:00.000Z	pike_	Optimus55	sorry im tied up atm maybe someone here can offer better advise
2007-12-18T01:24:00.000Z	pike_	Optimus55	its possible removing the new partition will fix it i suppose. thats one of the reasons i always mean to save my partitions table info. logical partitions are the way to go usually to avoid that its usually just things like windows that cant handle em
