2010-07-18T02:12:00.000Z	Ichat	cts	so what has the 'laptops lit  to do with network manager ;?
2010-07-18T02:13:00.000Z	cts	Ichat	You're right, I wanted to say: power management...  sorry.
2010-07-18T02:16:00.000Z	Ichat	cts	- doesn't powermanagement  have an option what to do when closing the lit???
2010-07-18T02:16:00.000Z	Ichat		id have to startup my laptop to see but i cant realy believe that there isn't one ...
2010-07-18T02:16:00.000Z	cts	Ichat	Yes, it has. But it offers only Blank screen, suspend, hibernate and shutdown.
2010-07-18T02:17:00.000Z	Ichat		isn't it locking when you blank it?
2010-07-18T02:17:00.000Z	cts	Ichat	No, unfortunately not.  I'd really prefer that.  It locks with suspend, but that's not the same.  :)
2010-07-18T02:18:00.000Z	Ichat		suspend isn't preferable for a short moment
2010-07-18T02:18:00.000Z	cts	Ichat	exactly.
2010-07-18T02:19:00.000Z	Ichat		hmm nice thin to go look for lol...     cuz i would love to set it up also  no you mention it
2010-07-18T02:21:00.000Z	cts	Ichat	What's the strategy? Go through the wishlist for power management?
2010-07-18T02:23:00.000Z	Ichat		im lookin now,  it think i found some in other treads... about   >>>  lidbtn
2010-07-18T02:24:00.000Z	cts	Ichat	lidbtn? Sorry, I'm new and don't understand that...
2010-07-18T02:24:00.000Z	Ichat		that action calls a script to either blank the screen or to shutdown  (ho-ever its set) --    you could  set it to call for a modified script that  expect  blancs screen also
2010-07-18T02:25:00.000Z	Ichat	cts	- look at:  /etc/acpi/events/lidbtn
2010-07-18T02:26:00.000Z	Ichat		that if still used should  call for a script that will   do what ever it is you wnat...    id say first set your     powermanager to   blanc screen,   and than  open this file and see what   commands its invoking on this....  the script that it calles should be the one we need
2010-07-18T02:27:00.000Z	Ichat		sorry bbl
2010-07-18T02:27:00.000Z	cts	Ichat	Sounds reasonable.  How did you find out so quick? :)
