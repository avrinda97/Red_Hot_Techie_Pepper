2012-03-01T15:03:00.000Z	sharpK		would you say debian is more stable than ubuntu?
2012-03-01T15:03:00.000Z	Abooda	sharpK	I would say Ubuntu is quite stable when used with the right DE. In my experience, KDE is nicht gut.
2012-03-01T15:04:00.000Z	sharpK	Abooda	is unity the right DE? because I am on IRC every single day with random hickups and errors, it's like windows 98....
2012-03-01T15:04:00.000Z	sharpK		granted, I'm new to all this, but still quite time-consuming...
2012-03-01T15:05:00.000Z	Abooda		I am on Gnome 2.x, haven't moved to Unity
2012-03-01T15:05:00.000Z	Abooda	sharpK	what problems are you having? what do you get when you put "top" in a commandline? which programs eat your resources?
2012-03-01T15:06:00.000Z	sharpK		I wish I could tell you that right now, but my ubuntu box isn't starting up and giving me a "Checking battery state.... [ OK ]" without ever loading, tried the [SOLVED] community post but it's still giving me the error...
2012-03-01T15:07:00.000Z	sharpK		though past errors have included xbmc freezing up the whole system, multi monitor setup being a nightmare, and various other things that havne't been smooth though seem like they should be (maybe I am spoiled coming from windows 7)
2012-03-01T15:07:00.000Z	Abooda	sharpK	try loading a previous kernel? or can you not even get that far? did this happen just after installing Unity?
2012-03-01T15:08:00.000Z	sharpK		abooda: this just happenned right now after rebooting... not exactly sure how/why...
2012-03-01T15:08:00.000Z	sharpK		actionparsnip, what do you use for your multimonitor setup? I used the nvidia control panel which gave me lots of random errors/hickups...
2012-03-01T15:08:00.000Z	Abooda	sharpK	you've probably done something wrong with your hardware setup .... this is not a Ubuntu issue. Do you get the chance to load a previous kernel?
2012-03-01T15:09:00.000Z	sharpK		abooda: how would one load a previous kernel? (I can SSH into it and issue terminal commands)
2012-03-01T15:09:00.000Z	Abooda	sharpK	no no, when you first boot, you get a list of kernels loaded, like choosing "safe mode"
2012-03-01T15:09:00.000Z	Abooda	sharpK	can you use safe mode?
2012-03-01T15:09:00.000Z	sharpK	Abooda	let me restart and try to catch it
2012-03-01T15:11:00.000Z	sharpK		abooda: weird, this restart it went through... it comes and goes like that, sometimes freezing on the checking battery, then I wait like 10 minutes, restart, and boots into unity...
2012-03-01T15:12:00.000Z	Abooda	sharpK	is this the first time it happened? try going through what ActionParsnip said ... see if it helps for later.
