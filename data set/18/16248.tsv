2004-10-26T15:34:00.000Z	lobo_nz		Whats the difference between universe and multiverse ?
2004-10-26T15:35:00.000Z	lobo_nz		Do I need both in my apt sources or does multiverse contain the universe?
2004-10-26T15:36:00.000Z	sabdfl	lobo_nz	they are distinct
2004-10-26T15:37:00.000Z	lobo_nz	sabdfl	Right, It just says to use multiverse when installing the nvidia binary driver on the wiki
2004-10-26T15:49:00.000Z	sabdfl	lobo_nz	which nvidia binary?
2004-10-26T15:51:00.000Z	lobo_nz	sabdfl	nvidia-glx
2004-10-26T15:54:00.000Z	lobo_nz	sabdfl	Right, I just want my nvidia to work then everything else I need is in the standard sources, is there a package search like the debian one?
2004-10-26T15:55:00.000Z	sabdfl	lobo_nz	no, we are working on it
2004-10-26T15:56:00.000Z	lobo_nz	sabdfl	And a fine job youre doing too :)
2004-10-26T15:57:00.000Z	lobo_nz	sabdfl	Heh, only when I installed it for the first time at work and my gnome stuck on the naked people loading screen and diddn't start up
2004-10-26T15:58:00.000Z	lobo_nz	sabdfl	I seem to be able to start gnome ok now I have made another user
2004-10-26T15:58:00.000Z	lobo_nz	sabdfl	I dont know, it gets error writing to a directory on the first user it made, I will find the exact error for you
2004-10-26T15:59:00.000Z	sabdfl	lobo_nz	this is a critical bug if it exists, please let me know when you find the details
2004-10-27T16:03:00.000Z	lobo_nz	sabdfl	It works fine on my home pc but on my work one It hung on first install then I made another user and gnome started slowly, now I can log into gnome as the first use made during install but I get this error 'Cannot save launcher to disk - Details: Error writing file 'file:///home/lobo/.gnome2/panel2.d/default/launchers/curly-...':Access denied'  I also get the same error for moe and hammer
2004-10-27T16:04:00.000Z	lobo_nz	sabdfl	I dont get those errors on the new users I made since install
2004-10-29T12:58:00.000Z	lobo_nz	sabdfl	I got gnome starting up - I have narrowed down the possible causes and it seems to be the MB
2004-10-29T12:58:00.000Z	sabdfl	lobo_nz	ok
2004-10-29T12:59:00.000Z	lobo_nz	sabdfl	I dont know what gnome would clash with my MB but I replaced it and my Processor and all is fine now - very weird
