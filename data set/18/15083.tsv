2006-03-29T13:40:00.000Z	Don	mebaran	try to use a proxy to check
2006-03-29T13:41:00.000Z	mebaran	Don	where would I find a proxy server for ftp
2006-03-29T13:42:00.000Z	Don	mebaran	I am not sure where exactly, try on anonymous proxy lists
2006-03-29T13:43:00.000Z	Don	mebaran	how is your client secured: just on your server with iptables or do you have a router in between ?
2006-03-29T13:43:00.000Z	Don	mebaran	I could check your server if it works for me too
2006-03-29T13:45:00.000Z	mebaran	Don	ftp://av:cows@mebtux.gotdns.com
2006-03-29T13:46:00.000Z	mebaran	Don	what?

2006-03-29T13:50:00.000Z	Don	mebaran	what do u mean with it works on and off ?
2006-03-29T13:51:00.000Z	mebaran	Don	like today it worked from a friends house and he just dll'ed some media
2006-03-29T13:52:00.000Z	Don	mebaran	it does not timeout when you connect via localhost - ergo, there is a connection problem
2006-03-29T13:52:00.000Z	Don	mebaran	why it worked for your friend - no clue
2006-03-29T13:52:00.000Z	Don	mebaran	I just can say, I faced the same problems till I opened up a passive range
2006-03-29T13:52:00.000Z	mebaran	Don	continaully timeouts?
2006-03-29T13:57:00.000Z	Don	mebaran	take a look at this to explain the ftp modes: http://www.linuxhomenetworking.com/wiki/index.php/Quick_HOWTO_:_Ch15_:_Linux_FTP_Server_Setup
