2008-01-17T06:49:00.000Z	alison		i belive ndiswrapper supports it
2008-01-17T06:49:00.000Z	alison		but i need .inf or sys file for it
2008-01-17T06:49:00.000Z	alison		i dont know i've read a lot of forums today and they all said different stuff
2008-01-17T06:49:00.000Z	alison		kinda confused now
2008-01-17T06:49:00.000Z	th0r	alison	you should be able to download the drivers from the manufacturer website...the windows drivers
2008-01-17T06:50:00.000Z	alison	th0r	what do you mean?
2008-01-17T06:50:00.000Z	th0r	alison	the sys and inf files you need are the windows drivers for your card...ndiswrapper uses the windows drivers
2008-01-17T06:51:00.000Z	alison	th0r	i have ndiswrapper instaled
2008-01-17T06:52:00.000Z	th0r	alison	do you have the windows drivers installed in ndiswrapper?
2008-01-17T06:52:00.000Z	alison	th0r	i think so, how to check?
2008-01-17T19:42:00.000Z	th0r	alison	I think wipe is available also
2008-01-17T19:44:00.000Z	th0r	alison	you should be able to define a 'send to' in the file manager for either wipe or shred to make it right click
