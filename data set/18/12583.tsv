2006-04-09T06:37:00.000Z	Firebird8		does modprobe usually take an extreme amount of time?
2006-04-09T06:37:00.000Z	mwe	Firebird8	No
2006-04-09T06:37:00.000Z	mwe	Firebird8	usually a few mileseconds
2006-04-09T06:38:00.000Z	Firebird8	mwe	modprobing ndiswrapper is taking a long time
2006-04-09T06:38:00.000Z	mwe	Firebird8	then it's probably broken
2006-04-09T06:38:00.000Z	mwe	Firebird8	what does dmesg say?
2006-04-09T06:38:00.000Z	mwe	Firebird8	that is type 'dmesg' in the console
2006-04-09T06:39:00.000Z	Firebird8	mwe	[4303562.433000]   <3>ndiswrapper (wrapper_init:173): loadndiswrapper failed (11); check system log for messages from 'loadndisdriver'
2006-04-09T06:40:00.000Z	mwe	Firebird8	yeah. borked. look at the end of /var/log/syslog
2006-04-09T06:42:00.000Z	mwe	Firebird8	did you install a driver that is supposed to work with it? not any driver will work
2006-04-09T06:42:00.000Z	Firebird8	mwe	um it said that the hardware is present and all
2006-04-09T06:43:00.000Z	mwe	Firebird8	it's still far from guaranteed to be working
2006-04-09T06:43:00.000Z	mwe	Firebird8	search the database at ndiswrapper.sf.net for the recomended driver for your card
2006-04-09T06:44:00.000Z	Firebird8	mwe	its a usb card and its not on there
2006-04-09T06:44:00.000Z	mwe	Firebird8	maybe it doesn't work with ndiswrapper then
2006-04-09T06:44:00.000Z	Firebird8	mwe	http://pastebin.com/639005
2006-04-09T06:45:00.000Z	mwe	Firebird8	it just says it failed and it bailed out
2006-04-09T06:46:00.000Z	mwe	Firebird8	then iptables firewall logging, unrelated
