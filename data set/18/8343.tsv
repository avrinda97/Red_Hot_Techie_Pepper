2009-02-10T10:53:00.000Z	cjae	mindrape	since dpkg didn't work
2009-02-10T10:45:00.000Z	mindrape	cjae	- did you build it from source or dpkg -i it?
2009-02-10T10:46:00.000Z	mindrape	cjae	- dpkg can remove it if it was a package install
2009-02-10T10:46:00.000Z	cjae	mindrape	apt
2009-02-10T10:46:00.000Z	mindrape	cjae	- and apt-get remove left remnants about?
2009-02-10T10:46:00.000Z	cjae	mindrape	I tried sudo apt-get purge google earth

2009-02-10T10:47:00.000Z	mindrape	cjae	- dunno man... odd.  I'd try dpkg -remove if apt-get is being childish and stupid.
2009-02-10T10:48:00.000Z	cjae	mindrape	I think I have to go through with locate and manually delete but will try dpkg first
2009-02-10T10:51:00.000Z	cjae	mindrape	is it safe it delete all the googleearth folders? like the ones in /var /opt and such?
2009-02-10T10:51:00.000Z	mindrape	cjae	- if you want to get rid of it and they are clearly marked as such I don't see why it would hurt.
2009-02-10T10:52:00.000Z	cjae	mindrape	ok
2009-02-10T10:53:00.000Z	cjae	mindrape	/var/lib/dpkg/info/googleearth-4.2-data.list is an example, this is safe to del?
