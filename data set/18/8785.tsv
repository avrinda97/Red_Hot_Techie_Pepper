2007-07-11T05:59:00.000Z	bruenig	pr4bh	metacity
2007-07-25T09:51:00.000Z	bruenig	pr4bh	you might be able to write one with wget and awk and grep and sed
2007-07-25T09:52:00.000Z	pr4bh	bruenig	umm, can u explain more plz?
2007-07-25T09:53:00.000Z	bruenig	pr4bh	hmmm, well you wget the page with weather information, you inspect the source to figure out how it situates things, and then you manipulate it with grep awk and sed so that it will get you whatever you want. like temperature or something like that, what did you want it to say
2007-07-25T09:54:00.000Z	pr4bh	bruenig	well, something like that yes..
2007-07-25T09:55:00.000Z	bruenig	pr4bh	alright because I am bored I will take a stab at it, find a webpage that has the information you want on it
2007-07-25T09:55:00.000Z	bruenig	pr4bh	and give me the link obviously
2007-07-25T09:56:00.000Z	pr4bh	bruenig	http://uk.weather.com/weather/local/WV1?x=0&where2=4rg&y=0
2007-07-25T10:03:00.000Z	bruenig	pr4bh	cat WV1 | grep obsTempText | sed -e 's|>||g' -e 's|\&.*||g' | awk -FB '{print $2}'
2007-07-25T10:03:00.000Z	bruenig	pr4bh	woops don't do that
2007-07-25T10:04:00.000Z	bruenig	pr4bh	ok here it is, this will find the temperature: wget -q http://uk.weather.com/weather/local/WV1 -O- | grep obsTempText | sed -e 's|>||g' -e 's|\&.*||g' | awk -FB '{print $2}'
2007-07-25T10:08:00.000Z	bruenig	pr4bh	did that work?
