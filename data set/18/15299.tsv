2005-04-14T13:08:00.000Z	bddebian		Hey folks.  OK, so I finally installed Ubuntu on one of my laptops and the install went great.  However, my routing table seems jacked up and route add default.. doesn't seem to work.  Any ideas?
2005-04-14T13:09:00.000Z	LeeJunFan	bddebian	what does route add default do?
2005-04-14T13:10:00.000Z	bddebian	LeeJunFan	I get "No such device"
2005-04-14T13:10:00.000Z	LeeJunFan	bddebian	the device doesn't seem to be up. if you have dhcp on your LAN you might try running sudo dhclient <device>
2005-04-14T13:11:00.000Z	bddebian	LeeJunFan	Ifconfig works fine and eth0 has an IP from dhcp
2005-04-14T13:12:00.000Z	LeeJunFan	bddebian	is eth0 a wired nic?
2005-04-14T13:12:00.000Z	bddebian	LeeJunFan	Nope, wireless
2005-04-14T13:13:00.000Z	LeeJunFan	bddebian	can you try this and see if you get replies: arping -I eth0 <ip of something else on your lan like a router>
2005-04-14T13:13:00.000Z	LeeJunFan	bddebian	that is an I (eye)
2005-04-14T13:14:00.000Z	bddebian	LeeJunFan	I can ping the router (.1) fine with that
2005-04-14T13:14:00.000Z	LeeJunFan	bddebian	can you do a plain ping?
2005-04-14T13:14:00.000Z	bddebian	LeeJunFan	Yes
2005-04-14T13:15:00.000Z	LeeJunFan	bddebian	what is the exact syntax you are using with route?
2005-04-14T13:15:00.000Z	bddebian	LeeJunFan	Well I think that is part of my problem..;-)
2005-04-14T13:16:00.000Z	LeeJunFan	bddebian	try 'ip route add default via <router ip>'
2005-04-14T13:17:00.000Z	LeeJunFan	bddebian	but it doesn't explain why it doesn't get set with dhcp.
2005-04-14T13:17:00.000Z	bddebian	LeeJunFan	Bahh, I had to use ip route change.  What a dolt.  Thanks a million for the help!
