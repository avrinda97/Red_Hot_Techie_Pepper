2012-05-21T18:21:00.000Z	mbartnic	OerHeks	I tried to change the language to english, but after I log in next time it changes to cn and wants to change folder names: You have logged in in a new language. You can automatically update the names of some standard folders in your home folder to match this language. The update would change the following folders: " and there it lists home, downloaded , documents and others as such
