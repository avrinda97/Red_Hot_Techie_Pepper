2009-07-03T00:41:00.000Z	didi		It seems an odd question, but is it possible to run a program by a user which hasn't a shell?
2009-07-03T00:42:00.000Z	mdm	didi	yes, in fact its preferable for many programs to run as a user whos shell is set to /bin/false
2009-07-03T00:44:00.000Z	didi	mdm	Run it like jrib suggested?
2009-07-03T00:45:00.000Z	mdm	didi	yes or more precisly depends on the program.  Some have command switches to run as a user
2009-07-03T00:47:00.000Z	didi	mdm	Tor have a config switch that says "drop root privileges and use this user instead". But I am actually not very comfortable believing in that.
2009-07-03T00:48:00.000Z	mdm	didi	its not very difficult to implement in a program, it it says it will run as a user, and ps shows it running as that user, well it is doing what it was set to do
2009-07-03T00:50:00.000Z	didi	mdm	Well. I think that you're right. But don't you fell very uncomfortable running something as root?
2009-07-03T00:52:00.000Z	mdm	didi	me personally no, but then again the stuff I run as root I know about, can read the source code and understand what it does.  I do with with mythtv so I can set proity threads, then again my myth frontends are more appliances then systems
2009-07-03T00:53:00.000Z	didi	mdm	Hum. Well, for now I will try the jrib solution until I get around the idea.
2009-07-03T00:53:00.000Z	mdm	didi	implitly root is not evil, its just dangerous.  Especially in the hands of a semi-knowledgeable user.  Or quite literally "a little bit of knowledge is a dangerous thing"
2009-07-03T00:54:00.000Z	didi	mdm	The all concept of running a process with super privileges just make me fell funny.
2009-07-03T00:55:00.000Z	mdm	didi	I dont think it was jribs idea as much as he gave you the command to run a program as a different user.  I would call it jrib was correct.
2009-07-03T00:56:00.000Z	mdm	didi	some things HAVE to run as root, thigns that access hardware directly (xorg being most notable).  But not all things need root.
2009-07-03T00:56:00.000Z	didi	mdm	I think I didn't quite understand what you meant about jrib "idea".
2009-07-03T00:57:00.000Z	mdm	didi	ok, but pay attention to what jrib tells you, he is knowledgeable
2009-07-03T00:57:00.000Z	didi	mdm	I know, I know. (although there are many people that do not like the idea of xorg been run as a privileged process)
2009-07-03T00:58:00.000Z	mdm	didi	like I said, root isnt dangerous any more then a rifle is.  It is how it is used (I would say misused) that is.
2009-07-03T00:59:00.000Z	didi	mdm	I personally would say that a rifle is *always* dangerous. But let not visit that place.
