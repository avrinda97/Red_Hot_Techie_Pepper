2006-05-22T05:46:00.000Z	wims	untung	 sure
2006-05-22T05:47:00.000Z	wims	untung	 but you need separate partitions
2006-05-22T05:47:00.000Z	untung	wims	how can we create separare partion on single harddisk?
2006-05-22T05:47:00.000Z	untung		and wims which one should i installed first, ubuntu or xp?
2006-05-22T05:49:00.000Z	wims	untung	there are several utilities that can partition your harddisk, like PQMAgic for Windows XP. But it costs money. I would install WinXP before  Ubuntu, but I don't know if it's required
2006-05-22T05:49:00.000Z	untung		xappe, how big the partition for ubuntu and what format? xp can do NTFS
2006-05-22T05:50:00.000Z	wims	untung	if you have a new harddisk without anything on it you can create new partitions with fdisk. If you have data on the harddisk it will be lost though
2006-05-22T05:51:00.000Z	untung	wims	i am thinking about creating a separate NTFS parttion and let ubuntu reformat that
2006-05-22T05:51:00.000Z	wims	untung	i would just leave empty unparti9tioned space at the end of the disc after the win xp partition
2006-05-22T05:51:00.000Z	wims	untung	 then let ubuntu installer use the rest of the free space for it's partitions
2006-05-22T05:52:00.000Z	untung		wims,xappe, you mean i leave the partition unformated?
2006-05-22T05:52:00.000Z	wims	untung	yes, make one partition for xp and just leave the rest of the disk unpartitioned. Make sure it's big enough for what you need for your linux install
2006-05-22T05:53:00.000Z	wims	untung	 how big you need is a matter of preferance
2006-05-22T05:53:00.000Z	untung		thanks wims, i will try to do that. What boot loader do i need?
2006-05-22T05:54:00.000Z	untung		wims; what i mean is the boot manager for ubuntu and xp?
2006-05-22T05:54:00.000Z	wims	untung	 there's a bootloader called GRUB thats installed in the ubuntu installer that works pretty good. It should be able to configure itself
2006-05-22T05:54:00.000Z	wims	untung	 or boot manager if you like
