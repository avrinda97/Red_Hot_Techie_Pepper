2011-12-20T17:35:00.000Z	resonantsky		hey
2011-12-20T17:35:00.000Z	resonantsky		can someone help me with usb device settings in ubuntu 11.10 ?
2011-12-20T17:35:00.000Z	SunTsu	resonantsky	not without knowing what _exactly_ you are talking about
2011-12-20T17:36:00.000Z	resonantsky	SunTsu	my xorg.0.log shows constant USB device disconnects and reconnects, the device in question: A Logitech USB Mouse
2011-12-20T17:37:00.000Z	SunTsu	resonantsky	maybe it's broken
2011-12-20T17:38:00.000Z	resonantsky	SunTsu	the USB bus or the mouse? the mouse is fine, works ok on another box, this box has been giving me trouble for a while...
2011-12-20T17:44:00.000Z	SunTsu	resonantsky	I don't know a way, but I'm not an usb expert
2011-12-20T17:45:00.000Z	resonantsky	SunTsu	ok no problem :]
2011-12-20T17:46:00.000Z	resonantsky	SunTsu	you know what is strange... i have 2 usb ports on this laptop, one 2.0 hub and one 1.1 hub... on the 2.0 hub the issue occurs frantically, 5 times a minute or so... and on the 1.1 hub its less prevailant...
2011-12-20T17:47:00.000Z	SunTsu	resonantsky	how old is that mouse?
2011-12-20T17:48:00.000Z	resonantsky	SunTsu	it has a usb port... so not old enough to be a exhibit at a computer history museum :]
2011-12-20T17:48:00.000Z	resonantsky	SunTsu	probably 3 years atleast...
2011-12-20T17:49:00.000Z	SunTsu	resonantsky	it could be usb1.x. and having speed negotiation issues
2011-12-20T17:49:00.000Z	resonantsky	SunTsu	hmm yes.
2011-12-20T17:50:00.000Z	resonantsky	SunTsu	any idea where I can find usb commands related to accelration/speed factors or device profiles... such as the 'MOUSE' profile in Ubuntu... maybe I can create a workaround...
2011-12-20T17:51:00.000Z	SunTsu	resonantsky	http://www.linux-usb.org/FAQ.html doesn't have the answer?
2011-12-20T17:52:00.000Z	resonantsky	SunTsu	that will do :] thanks due.
2011-12-20T17:55:00.000Z	resonantsky	SunTsu	ahh, here we are /sys/bus/usb/devices/ ... cool.
