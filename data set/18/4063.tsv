2009-08-11T10:11:00.000Z	supa		I've been trying to get vuze to run at bootup for like three hours now. does anyone know an easy way to run a command at boot-up?
2009-08-11T10:12:00.000Z	edbian	supa	At bootup or at login?
2009-08-11T10:12:00.000Z	supa		no, i want it to run  before the gnome session
2009-08-11T10:12:00.000Z	supa		it's a headless server
2009-08-11T10:14:00.000Z	supa		well, i've tried that - although admittedly i don't know what i'm doing.

2009-08-11T10:25:00.000Z	supa	edbian	i have tried this, but it will not launch
2009-08-11T10:26:00.000Z	edbian	supa	Is it executable?
2009-08-11T10:27:00.000Z	supa		yeah, i can run it in the terminal and it will launch
2009-08-11T10:27:00.000Z	edbian	supa	Can root run it?  init runs things as root
2009-08-11T10:27:00.000Z	supa		how would I check? sudo?
2009-08-11T10:28:00.000Z	edbian		yeah
2009-08-11T10:28:00.000Z	edbian		or su
2009-08-11T10:28:00.000Z	supa		nope, it can't.
2009-08-11T10:28:00.000Z	supa		what can i do? can i run it as a user or something?
2009-08-11T10:28:00.000Z	edbian	supa	You can change the permissions to allow root to run it.
2009-08-11T10:29:00.000Z	edbian	supa	"sudo chmod +x <file>" will make it executable by all users.
