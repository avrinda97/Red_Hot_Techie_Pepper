2012-01-08T10:00:00.000Z	nimbiotics		Hello all. I have a single disk on my laptop that has 3 partititons" sda1  (110.8Gb) which is ext4; sda2 (1012Mb) extended and sda5 (1012Mb) which is of unknown type, while I was thinking this was the swap area. What can I do in order to fix this, have a safe swap area and be able to hibernate and/or suspend. TIA!

2012-01-08T10:02:00.000Z	[deXter]	nimbiotics	Not here, but on paste.ubuntu.com
2012-01-08T10:02:00.000Z	nimbiotics	[deXter]	ok
2012-01-08T10:07:00.000Z	nimbiotics	[deXter]	output at http://paste.ubuntu.com/796746/  I also got error message: "Disk /dev/mapper/cryptswap1 doesn't contain a valid partition table". I did delete the partition after unsuccessfully trying to format it
2012-01-08T10:09:00.000Z	[deXter]	nimbiotics	okay can you paste the output of mount
2012-01-08T10:12:00.000Z	nimbiotics	[deXter]	output(s) at http://paste.ubuntu.com/796748/ ... Thought I had a good idea and deleted the extended partition; nothing got fixed. Won't touch again
2012-01-08T10:16:00.000Z	[deXter]	nimbiotics	Well yep, looks like your partition table is messed up; do you remember how it was before this happened?
2012-01-08T10:18:00.000Z	nimbiotics	[deXter]	afaik, 3 partitions; sda1  110.8Gb, ext4; sda2 1012Mb, extended; and sda5 1012Mb of unknown type
2012-01-08T10:19:00.000Z	[deXter]	nimbiotics	what do you mean unknown type?
2012-01-08T10:19:00.000Z	nimbiotics	[deXter]	thats what gparted was reporting
2012-01-08T10:20:00.000Z	[deXter]	nimbiotics	But didn't you create the partitions or did someone else did?
2012-01-08T10:21:00.000Z	nimbiotics	[deXter]	I can only guess those are the partitions created at installtion ... I'm not very linux savvy
2012-01-08T10:33:00.000Z	nimbiotics	[deXter]	... any comments?
2012-01-08T10:35:00.000Z	[deXter]	nimbiotics	Well I suggest running testdisk and see if the partitions it detects matched what you had earlier. if it did, then you can write the partition table
2012-01-08T10:38:00.000Z	nimbiotics	[deXter]	1) How do I know whether they match or not? 2)How do I write the partition table? & 3) What if the dont match?
2012-01-08T10:40:00.000Z	[deXter]	nimbiotics	Well it'll show a list of partitions as to what it thinks is correct.. like it will detect say ext4, followed by w/e and then see if this looks reasonable. there will be an option to save/write the parition table after it's finished scanning
2012-01-08T10:41:00.000Z	nimbiotics	[deXter]	thx!
