2008-12-19T10:16:00.000Z	dennister		why am i being ignored here? I have been patient while others who come into channel after me get helped
2008-12-19T10:18:00.000Z	tiyowan	dennister	Um, what version of Windows are you using?
2008-12-19T10:18:00.000Z	dennister	tiyowan	w2k...
2008-12-19T10:19:00.000Z	tiyowan	dennister	Um, why don't you just go through with a standard install? GRUB will happily coexist with Windows.
2008-12-19T10:21:00.000Z	tiyowan	dennister	Again, I need to ask why?
2008-12-19T10:27:00.000Z	tiyowan	dennister	See above.
2008-12-19T13:50:00.000Z	tiyowan	dennister	grub-install.
2008-12-19T13:52:00.000Z	tiyowan	dennister	Are you using the LiveCD right now?
2008-12-19T13:53:00.000Z	dennister	tiyowan	nope...on a different machine...my own
2008-12-19T13:54:00.000Z	tiyowan	dennister	Okay. What you need to do is to boot off the LiveCD, then go to a terminal, then type grub-install /dev/X where X is where you want to install it.
2008-12-19T13:56:00.000Z	dennister	tiyowan	ah, ok...thx
2008-12-19T14:17:00.000Z	dennister	tiyowan	still having a bit of trouble here...in livecd mode, have sdb1 mounted (mbr of sdb is where I want grub and sdb1 is root partition), but when I type in 'sudo grub-install /dev/sdb' i keep getting told it can't find /boot "not found or not a block device"
2008-12-19T14:19:00.000Z	tiyowan	dennister	Hang on.
2008-12-19T14:22:00.000Z	tiyowan	dennister	Have you mounted the partition which contains linux?
