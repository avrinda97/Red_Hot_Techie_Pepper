2005-04-10T11:41:00.000Z	St0n3-C0l	alterim	I think you should use your mind in installing Themes, not in this case
2005-04-10T11:42:00.000Z	alterim	St0n3-C0l	no net connection
2005-04-10T11:46:00.000Z	St0n3-C0l	alterim	Go in terminal and type 'tar -zxvf 21237-clearlooks-metacity-0.5.tar.gz -C /home/username/.themes
2005-04-10T11:46:00.000Z	St0n3-C0l	alterim	leave them!
