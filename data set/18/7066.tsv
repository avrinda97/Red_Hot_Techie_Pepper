2008-03-30T20:41:00.000Z	reaktae	zackyramone	press alt+f2 and type in gksudo nautilus /media/
2008-03-30T20:41:00.000Z	reaktae	zackyramone	there you should have a folder corresponding to the drive and try the right-click again...
2008-03-30T20:43:00.000Z	zackyramone	reaktae	still wont work, it tells me its read-only
2008-03-30T20:44:00.000Z	reaktae	zackyramone	did you type in your superuser password?

2008-03-30T20:46:00.000Z	zackyramone	reaktae	now i did write the password but it still tells me its in read only
2008-03-30T20:48:00.000Z	reaktae	zackyramone	weird.. it worked for me... try asking again... I might learn along...
