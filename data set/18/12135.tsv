2006-06-01T14:36:00.000Z	kane777	thug	well have you tried downloading it from BT (bit torrent)... obviously your connection was reset/failed during download... try bittorrent... this way you can resume broken downloads...
2006-06-01T14:37:00.000Z	thug	kane777	no the connection didnt failed
2006-06-01T14:37:00.000Z	thug	kane777	never seen this before ...
2006-06-01T14:37:00.000Z	kane777	thug	well did it go all the way to 100%??
2006-06-01T14:37:00.000Z	thug	kane777	yes
2006-06-01T14:38:00.000Z	thug	kane777	downloaded complete
2006-06-01T14:38:00.000Z	kane777	thug	hmmm... that's strange...
2006-06-01T14:38:00.000Z	thug	kane777	yes it is
2006-06-01T14:40:00.000Z	kane777	thug	but did you see it being close to 100%... because it happend few times to me that I was downloading something and when I came back it said download complete but the connection was reset during this and my download program thought its finished...
2006-06-01T14:41:00.000Z	thug	kane777	kane777 well i didnt  but i tryed 2 times and happend same thing every time ;)
2006-06-01T14:44:00.000Z	kane777	thug	so there are two possibilities... try downloading via jigsaw or bittorrent... or there is one more wget... this can resume downloads as well... or there is just one more... ship it cds... but I think you don't want to wait two months... :)
2006-06-01T14:45:00.000Z	thug	kane777	:)) i wanna get it done tonight so i can fire up dapper. thanks for you`r help
