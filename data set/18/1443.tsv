2011-02-17T22:37:00.000Z	MrMintanet2		Can someone tell me how I can setup my Ubuntu box to act as a file server?  I want to be able to map windows computers to it over the internet rather than LAN.
2011-02-17T22:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MrMintanet2	if you install openssh-server, you have an SFTP server already :)
2011-02-17T22:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MrMintanet2	sftp is great for WAN access as it's secure
2011-02-18T00:26:00.000Z	MrMintanet2	ActionParsnip	that was my real question....  thanks for the chat etiquette snippet...  Do you feel that helps people?
2011-02-18T00:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MrMintanet2	yes as it gets them to ask te real question. In responce to your question, I'm sure people do use it
2011-02-18T00:30:00.000Z	MrMintanet2	ActionParsnip	I am looking for someone who uses it.  I am not going to write out a paragraph question if there isn't anyone in here who uses it.  Go lecture someone else.  I'm not causing any harm.
2011-02-18T00:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MrMintanet2	just ask, like ubottu says, then anyone using it will reply.
2011-02-18T00:32:00.000Z	MrMintanet2	ActionParsnip	thanks for the worldly advice.  I will be sure to refer back to it when it actually applies to my chat behavior.
2011-02-18T00:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MrMintanet2	its te standard reply for when users use pointles questions like "does anyone use" etc, its a worthless question
2011-02-18T00:36:00.000Z	MrMintanet2	ActionParsnip	Again, thank you for the explanation as to why you felt the need to tell me how to ask questions.  Luckily, my question was pertinent in the context it was asked, regardless if you think so or not.  I'm not an ass.  I know how to ask a question.
2011-02-18T00:37:00.000Z	MrMintanet2	ActionParsnip	Rather than having this banter in the chat, you can message me.  I do not think that it is appropriate for us to sit and debate this in the room.
2011-02-18T00:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MrMintanet2	i've said all I can really
2011-02-18T02:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MrMintanet2	dia maybe?
2011-02-18T02:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MrMintanet2	does it not fly with wine?
2011-02-18T02:50:00.000Z	MrMintanet2	ActionParsnip	I try to stay away from Wine if possible.
2011-02-18T02:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MrMintanet2	basic stuff seems to work but its not an app i've used, sorry I can't help more
2011-02-18T02:53:00.000Z	MrMintanet2	ActionParsnip	No prob!  Just looking.  I am trying to draft up a nifty network map on my 10.10 box, but I can't find anything "eye candy-ish" enough.
