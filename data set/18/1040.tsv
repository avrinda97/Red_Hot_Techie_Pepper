2011-08-19T15:39:00.000Z	propus	Kingsy	a f*cking sucky dm :D
2011-08-19T15:39:00.000Z	Kingsy	propus	ohhh yeah I have used it.... and i HATE ity
2011-08-19T15:39:00.000Z	Kingsy		so thats ok
2011-08-19T15:40:00.000Z	Kingsy		basically I think my 11.04 installation has a kernel bug so I am going to have to clean install the LTS
2011-08-19T15:41:00.000Z	propus	Kingsy	me too.. it is very awful to have it when using lot of applications.. gnome classic is the way :D
2011-08-19T15:42:00.000Z	Kingsy	propus	:) you have the kernel bug? or you hate unity? :)
2011-08-19T15:42:00.000Z	propus	Kingsy	i hate it :)
2011-08-19T15:46:00.000Z	Kingsy	propus	do you use 11.04 or the LTS ?
2011-08-19T15:47:00.000Z	propus	Kingsy	11.04 x86_64 kernel 2.6.38.10.
2011-08-19T15:49:00.000Z	Kingsy	propus	argh, hehe I don't get it.. everyone here uses 11.04 and I am the only one with this weird kworker issue
2011-08-19T15:49:00.000Z	Kingsy		nevermind
2011-08-19T15:49:00.000Z	propus	Kingsy	what is the problem?
2011-08-19T15:50:00.000Z	Kingsy	propus	for some reason my hdd light is on perminatly, so I checkout iotop and there is a kworker thread working all of the time, read/writing constantly at 70-100MB/s and I don't know why/what its doing
2011-08-19T15:50:00.000Z	Kingsy	propus	did some research and asked around, and it looks like its a "kernel bug"
2011-08-19T15:51:00.000Z	propus	Kingsy	is it you're system disk or storage?
2011-08-19T15:52:00.000Z	Kingsy	propus	well thats the thing, I have one disk for operating system and one disk for storage (which is raid) I cant even tell which disk its read/writing to
