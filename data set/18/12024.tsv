2007-04-13T06:52:00.000Z	frank_b		my Jetway PM800BMS motherboard computer doesn't detect my new SATA hard drive. do I need to detect/configure it in my BIOS?
2007-04-13T06:53:00.000Z	Pelo	frank_b	probably
2007-04-13T06:53:00.000Z	frank_b	Pelo	I can't see any option to do that in the BIOS. just for "IDE" hard drives. I don't think SATA falls into that category
2007-04-13T06:55:00.000Z	Pelo	frank_b	 if you can plug a sata on your mobo it must be able to handle them ,  my sata is setup as a terciary master if that helps
2007-04-13T06:55:00.000Z	frank_b	Pelo	ok, thanks
2007-04-13T07:08:00.000Z	Pelo	frank_b	check the maker's site then
2007-04-14T16:24:00.000Z	Pelo	frank_b	 yes
2007-04-14T16:25:00.000Z	frank_b	Pelo	ok, thanks
2007-04-14T16:27:00.000Z	frank_b	Pelo	by the way, my problem yesterday about my new SATA drive was a conflit between the speed of the drive and the one allowed by the motherboard. I needed to put a jumper on the hard drive to limit the speed to 1.5Gb
2007-04-14T16:27:00.000Z	Pelo	frank_b	  ahah , I knew it was a jumper thing
2007-04-14T16:29:00.000Z	frank_b	Pelo	yes, following your advise I checked for jumpers on the motherboard, the site said it was a "jumperless" one, and that reminded me of a warning in the hard drive manual for rare cases where you needed a jumper...
2007-04-14T16:29:00.000Z	frank_b	Pelo	thank you for your help
2007-04-29T06:09:00.000Z	frank_b	Pelo	no, not in the home partition, althought it gave an error in the root partition before
2007-04-29T06:10:00.000Z	Pelo	frank_b	 you should be warry of root partition error,  did you try rebooting ?
2007-04-29T06:10:00.000Z	frank_b	Pelo	yes, same thing happens
2007-04-29T06:11:00.000Z	Pelo	frank_b	 check the forum this has never happend to me, but I have a fair idea that you will need to reinstall
2007-04-29T06:11:00.000Z	frank_b	Pelo	ok, thanks. I've tried reinstalling, yet same thing happens
2007-04-29T06:14:00.000Z	frank_b	Pelo	that's what I think also, something wrong in the disk. thanks for your suggestion. I'll try it
