2007-02-06T12:44:00.000Z	Phuzion		i was able to do lots of things
2007-02-06T12:44:00.000Z	Phuzion		pinging was definitely one of them
2007-02-06T12:45:00.000Z	Phuzion		seems like it should work
2007-02-06T12:46:00.000Z	Phuzion		unfortunately, no
2007-02-06T12:46:00.000Z	Phuzion		it's a headless machine, and I have no network connection to it
2007-02-06T12:46:00.000Z	Phuzion		and I do not feel like typing this out
2007-02-06T12:47:00.000Z	Phuzion		its a headless machine with no network connection
2007-02-06T12:47:00.000Z	Phuzion		well, not headless right now
2007-02-06T12:47:00.000Z	Phuzion		alright
2007-02-06T12:48:00.000Z	Phuzion		anything specific you're looking for?
2007-02-06T12:48:00.000Z	AzMoo	Phuzion	don't mean to state the obvious, but have you tested the cable?
2007-02-06T12:48:00.000Z	Phuzion	AzMoo	the machine was up and running 5 minutes ago, the cable got moved maybe 5 inches
2007-02-06T12:49:00.000Z	AzMoo	Phuzion	yeah, I've seen cables die like that.
2007-02-06T12:54:00.000Z	AzMoo	Phuzion	then it didn't respond to ping.
2007-02-06T12:54:00.000Z	Phuzion	AzMoo	From a different pc it responds to ping
2007-02-06T12:55:00.000Z	AzMoo	Phuzion	depending on your subnet, but usually yes.
2007-02-06T12:57:00.000Z	AzMoo	Phuzion	you can ping localhost and the ip address assigned to the interface?
2007-02-06T12:57:00.000Z	Phuzion	AzMoo	yes
