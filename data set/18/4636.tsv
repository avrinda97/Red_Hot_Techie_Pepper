2009-08-20T09:59:00.000Z	neil_d		on my amd64 the flash player has stopped working :( firefox says it hasn't the plugin :( I have re-configured the "flashplugin-installer" package but this hasn't helped. Can anyone help?

2009-08-20T10:06:00.000Z	Xerran	neil_d	go to your .mozilla and make a folder called "plugins"
2009-08-20T10:07:00.000Z	Xerran	neil_d	extract the .so file and drag it or copy and paste it into that plugins folder you made
2009-08-20T10:07:00.000Z	neil_d	Xerran	its going now... I wonder why it didn't work when I did a dpkg-reconfigure on the same package.
