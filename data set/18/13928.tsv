2005-10-12T15:37:00.000Z	hjk57		someone recommended using psyBNC on xchat/breezy preview.  can't 'install' it. anyone have any tips?
2005-10-12T15:39:00.000Z	hjk57		no clue.. also tried using just 'bnc'.. not sure how to configure it though.
2005-10-12T15:39:00.000Z	hjk57		i just want to mask real ip on here.
2005-10-12T15:39:00.000Z	hjk57		am open to any sugguestions
2005-10-12T15:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	hjk57	 why bother.
2005-10-12T15:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		its like an irc proxy
2005-10-12T15:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		it has some uses.. like it can sort of make you stay on irc, then you can connect to it from other macines and still be in same room, or somthing.. i forget.
2005-10-12T15:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		and a proxy would not show your origianl ip.
2005-10-12T15:43:00.000Z	hjk57		i'm new irc/xchat.. am assuming red text was a PM (?) if not, sorry for messaging you, Dr_Willis
2005-10-12T15:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		i dident see no msg. :P
2005-10-12T15:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		lol..
2005-10-12T15:43:00.000Z	hjk57		hmm
2005-10-12T15:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		redtext may be text that has your nick in it. hjk57
2005-10-12T15:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		:P
2005-10-12T15:43:00.000Z	hjk57		ohhhhh
2005-10-12T15:44:00.000Z	hjk57		thanks :)
2005-10-12T15:45:00.000Z	hjk57	Dr_Willis	i just don't like my ip freely available to anyone..  so any tips ?
2005-10-12T15:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	hjk57	 dont worry about it. every time ive seen some one be paranoid about that on irc.. its not been worth worrying about
