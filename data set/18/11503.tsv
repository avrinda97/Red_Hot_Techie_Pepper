2006-10-10T14:46:00.000Z	kihai		Hi there! I have a prob with the loglevel of pam (At least I think it's due to pam). I'm using edubuntu with ltsp and want to log both the login times and the logout times of remotely connected users. Sadly only the login times are logged. I tried changing the loglevel of ssh_config, but it doesn't work. Logout times of locally logged in users are logged, but not those of remote users. What can I do to fix this? A log in /var/log/auth.log looks like this: Oct
2006-10-10T14:47:00.000Z	therp	kihai	doesn't wtmp include logout times?
2006-10-10T14:47:00.000Z	therp	kihai	but that's not what you've asked for..
2006-10-10T14:47:00.000Z	kihai		I'm not sure, but the logging takes place via ssh, so maybe this is the key problem...
2006-10-10T14:49:00.000Z	kihai	therp	...how can I access wtmp. When I cat it, it shows only gibberish...
2006-10-10T14:49:00.000Z	therp		kiahi: last
2006-10-10T14:49:00.000Z	kihai	therp	Thought so... last only shows logins of local users...
2006-10-10T14:50:00.000Z	therp	kihai	that's definately false for my system. wtmp logs all interactive sessions
2006-10-10T14:50:00.000Z	kihai	therp	Are you using edubuntu's ltsp or ltsp 4.1/4.2?
2006-10-10T14:51:00.000Z	therp	kihai	no
2006-10-10T14:51:00.000Z	kihai	therp	Cause edubuntu uses ssh for connections
2006-10-10T14:51:00.000Z	therp	kihai	my wtmp includes ssh sessions
2006-10-10T14:51:00.000Z	therp		and that's regular behaviour
2006-10-10T14:51:00.000Z	kihai	therp	Do you know where to configure that?
2006-10-10T14:52:00.000Z	therp		imho sshd is responsible for that (maybe even pam as sshd uses the pam session directives). I have no idea, sorry.
2006-10-10T14:53:00.000Z	kihai	therp	I already tried to increase the loglevel of sshd, but I don't know where to change loglevels of pam, or changing any settings of pam at all...
2006-10-10T14:54:00.000Z	therp	kihai	usually /etc/pam.d
2006-10-10T14:58:00.000Z	kihai	therp	Tried /etc/pam.d, but couldn't find any entry related to increasing loglevel or enabling logout logging.
