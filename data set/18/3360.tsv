2010-06-22T20:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	thune3	 correct. Removeing a package via package manager will NOT NOT NOT touch the stuff in the users home dirs..
2010-07-22T00:21:00.000Z	thune3	Dr_Willis	does a search on the calculated md5sum return anything?
2010-07-22T00:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	thune3	 checking other places for the md5sums now..
2010-07-22T00:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	thune3	even weirder. torrent client verified it as being ok.. but the md5sums are not matching from /dev/cdrom or from the iso file. with what i see on 2 different ubuntu sites.
2010-07-22T00:29:00.000Z	thune3	Dr_Willis	i can only think that the shipit cd has some extra zero padding at the end, causing the mismatch.
2010-07-22T00:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	thune3	 yea.  may of been when i dd'd it..  the other iso's i downloaded to match.
2010-07-22T00:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	thune3	 well i will red5sum the torrent one now. :)
2010-08-15T09:50:00.000Z	thune3	Dr_Willis	This guy said he had to enable ahci in bios: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1528398
2010-08-15T09:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	thune3	 ok.. - im reorganising some stuff and will try that. In 'theory' an external eSata should be as fast as an internal hd right?
2010-08-15T09:53:00.000Z	thune3	Dr_Willis	should be same as sata 1.5 if i understand it
2010-08-22T07:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	thune3	 odd.. ive never noticed that issue with using grub2 to boot ISO files.
2010-08-22T07:55:00.000Z	thune3	Dr_Willis	could i see your menuentry? (maybe you have secret sauce)
2010-08-22T07:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	thune3	 its not on this box.. but I do have links to the guides/examples at http://delicious.com/dr_willis/ under the grub2 tags I think
2010-08-22T07:55:00.000Z	thune3	Dr_Willis	i'll take a look, thx
2010-08-22T07:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	thune3	 now if only all the disrto makers would follow the same standard to get grub2 booting them all. :)
2010-08-22T08:02:00.000Z	thune3	Dr_Willis	too bad the relevant link Booting ISO files from GRUB 2 [Robert's Journal] http://rww.dreamwidth.org/3100.html is behind a sign in/up wall.
2010-08-22T10:31:00.000Z	thune3	Dr_Willis	UbuntuNoob has IntelÂ® 855GM
2010-09-26T11:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	thune3	 yes.. it does do that.. and i find it annoying
