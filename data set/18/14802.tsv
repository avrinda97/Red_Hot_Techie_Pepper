2005-09-07T12:45:00.000Z	stjepan	wolki	but how to install
2005-09-07T12:46:00.000Z	wolki	stjepan	if it's not your out of luck. you either have to install it manually, which is a big hassle, or try if the debian packages work on breezy
2005-09-07T12:47:00.000Z	stjepan	wolki	I have hoary
2005-09-07T12:47:00.000Z	wolki	stjepan	i had it working from smoons repository, but he stopped updating it and i'm not sure it's still up
2005-09-07T12:48:00.000Z	stjepan	wolki	you have engage on ubuntu?
2005-09-07T12:48:00.000Z	wolki	stjepan	debian packages will not work on hoary easily. wait a month and try on breezy
2005-09-07T12:48:00.000Z	wolki	stjepan	changed to breezy and didn't set it up there yet, but i did have it running on hoary
2005-09-07T12:49:00.000Z	wolki	stjepan	because the require a newer version of libc than hoary has
2005-09-07T12:49:00.000Z	wolki	stjepan	like i said, smoon's repos. howto in the forums
