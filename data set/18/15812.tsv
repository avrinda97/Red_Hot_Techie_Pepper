2005-01-20T16:18:00.000Z	zensamsara		it just hangs there forever
2005-01-20T16:18:00.000Z	zensamsara		what could be causing this?
2005-01-20T16:19:00.000Z	zensamsara		my guess is that the only option i have is to take out the hard disk, put it into another machine as slave, and try to fix it
2005-01-20T16:19:00.000Z	zensamsara		either formatting the mbr, or just formatting the whole disk
2005-01-20T16:19:00.000Z	zensamsara		k
2005-01-20T16:19:00.000Z	zensamsara		my home pc is a dual boot sys
2005-01-20T16:19:00.000Z	zensamsara		and after everything installed correctly, and i rebooted the system
2005-01-20T16:20:00.000Z	zensamsara		now i cannot get past the initial splash screen of my pc
2005-01-20T16:20:00.000Z	zensamsara		etc
2005-01-20T16:20:00.000Z	zensamsara		nothing loads
2005-01-20T16:21:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	zensamsara	sounds like your BIOS is FUBAR
2005-01-20T16:21:00.000Z	zensamsara	HrdwrBoB	and could the installation of ubuntu have caused this?
2005-01-20T16:22:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	zensamsara	no
2005-01-20T16:48:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	zensamsara	it's possible that the disk is physically broken
2005-01-20T16:49:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	zensamsara	and doesn't allow the system to POST when it's in
2005-01-20T16:49:00.000Z	zensamsara	HrdwrBoB	but it was working perfectly right before i installed ubuntu
2005-01-20T16:49:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	zensamsara	ubuntu being installed is, in this case, a bit of a red herring
2005-01-20T16:50:00.000Z	zensamsara	HrdwrBoB	a bit of a red herring?
