2008-12-07T14:03:00.000Z	rww	Snow|man	just type your whole message on one line. You don't need to split it up into several, and when you do, it makes the channel harder to read.
2008-12-07T14:04:00.000Z	rww	Snow|man	it's one of those rules that makes more sense during the day when there's 20 people talking at once, but which is enforced all the time :)
2008-12-07T14:04:00.000Z	rww	Snow|man	anyway. Do you get any sort of graphics at any point? An Ubuntu logo with an orange scrollbar? Any sort of desktop?
2008-12-07T14:06:00.000Z	rww	Snow|man	did it say anything about busybox, by any chance?
2008-12-07T14:07:00.000Z	rww	Snow|man	okay. Follow the instructions here to check that the DVD burned okay: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/CDIntegrityCheck?action=show&redirect=CDIntegrityCheck
2008-12-07T14:11:00.000Z	rww	Snow|man	if the integrity check says your media is fine, try booting in safe graphics mode (second option on the boot menu instead of the first)
2008-12-07T14:52:00.000Z	rww	Snow|man	yes. Put the .iso and the Wubi installer in the same folder
2008-12-07T14:53:00.000Z	rww	Snow|man	if it starts downloading the amd64 .iso instead of using the one you downloaded, start wubi with the --32bit argument (according to the wubi FAQ)
