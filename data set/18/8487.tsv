2008-01-16T03:20:00.000Z	scguy318	castigan	did you get the Ubuntu Server edition?
2008-01-16T03:21:00.000Z	scguy318	castigan	that's why you have no X, what khermans said for the entire Ubuntu desktop packages
2008-01-16T03:22:00.000Z	scguy318	castigan	are your sources.list a-ok?
2008-01-16T03:23:00.000Z	scguy318	castigan	well yes, Ubuntu Server gives you a minimalist server installation
2008-01-16T03:23:00.000Z	scguy318	castigan	yes, Ubuntu desktop CD
2008-01-16T03:27:00.000Z	scguy318	castigan	sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list, uncomment the line for main repository, sudo aptitude update && sudo aptitude install ubuntu-desktop
2008-01-16T03:27:00.000Z	scguy318	castigan	or that
2008-01-16T03:28:00.000Z	scguy318	castigan	check your /etc/apt/sources.list or regenerate them
