2006-07-19T05:58:00.000Z	Indigo423		did you know how many memory can ubuntu have?
2006-07-19T05:58:00.000Z	stefg	Indigo423	up to 64GB with big-iron kernel
2006-07-19T05:59:00.000Z	Indigo423		64GB of RAM ??
2006-07-19T05:59:00.000Z	Indigo423		wow
2006-07-19T06:00:00.000Z	Indigo423		is the big-iron kernel an 64bit kernel ??
2006-07-19T06:02:00.000Z	Indigo423		i would like install an vm-ware server based on an ubuntu server, one of my first questions was, can ubuntu address more than 4 GB RAM with an 32 bit kernel.
2006-07-19T06:03:00.000Z	Indigo423		i have seen some problems with m$ os, and i must first activate PAE support and some other dirty things to address more then 4 GB RAM
2006-07-19T06:03:00.000Z	Indigo423		;)
2006-07-19T06:03:00.000Z	stefg	Indigo423	yes, but not with the stock-kernel... you'll have to recompile
2006-07-19T06:04:00.000Z	stefg		!info linux-image-server
2006-07-19T06:06:00.000Z	Indigo423	stefg	the stock-kernel is default in the linux images, which i can download with apt ?
2006-07-19T06:07:00.000Z	stefg	Indigo423	ubuntu installs with a 386 (non arch-optimized) kernel. But after installation you've got a wealth of different kernels for different scenarios to choose from
2006-07-19T06:10:00.000Z	Indigo423	stefg	ah ok then i can install some kernels like -server or -bigiron kernels.
2006-07-19T06:10:00.000Z	stefg		exactly
2006-07-19T06:12:00.000Z	Indigo423	stefg	did you know some good urls, who i can find some technical specifications from the different kernels?
2006-07-19T06:15:00.000Z	stefg	Indigo423	that's normally stated in synaptic, or whatever frontend to apt you use
2006-07-19T06:15:00.000Z	stefg		!es
2006-07-19T06:16:00.000Z	Indigo423	stefg	thx i will try it. you`re great help. nice evening.
