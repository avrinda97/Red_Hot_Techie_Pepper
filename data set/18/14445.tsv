2006-09-04T06:34:00.000Z	EnsignRedshirt		Very frustrating... I might have to break down and by a regular DVD player instead of using the computer.
2006-09-04T06:34:00.000Z	markrian	EnsignRedshirt	what's happening with libdvdcss for you?
2006-09-04T06:35:00.000Z	EnsignRedshirt	markrian	I often get messages from totem saying the the disc appears to be encrypted.  The message often pops up after I've been watching the DVD for a while.
2006-09-04T06:37:00.000Z	markrian	EnsignRedshirt	are you using totem-xine? Which version of libdvdcss do you have? I have 1.2.9 and I've not had any problems.
2006-09-04T06:38:00.000Z	EnsignRedshirt	markrian	I'm using totem-xine, and libdvdcss2 version 1.2.5-1.  I'm using breezy.
2006-09-04T06:38:00.000Z	markrian	EnsignRedshirt	 You say that you get the error after watching the DVD for a while? Because that sounds like the drive is having trouble reading the disc
2006-09-04T06:40:00.000Z	EnsignRedshirt	markrian	Yes, sometimes half-way through the movie, an error message pops up.  The strange thing is, if I use the controls to skip ahead of that point before the error occurs, I can sometimes watch the rest of the movie.
2006-09-04T06:41:00.000Z	markrian	EnsignRedshirt	given that I'd almost guarantee that the disc has a scratch  on it that your drive can't correct/see through properly
2006-09-04T06:41:00.000Z	markrian	EnsignRedshirt	you should consider cleaning them/and or your drive's lens
2006-09-04T06:42:00.000Z	EnsignRedshirt	markrian	Hmmm... that could be, I guess. Now that I think about it, it has occurred more frequently with rented DVDs.
2006-09-04T06:43:00.000Z	markrian	EnsignRedshirt	there is a more up-to-date libdvdcss available which you could install anyway, but I don't think it'd fix your problems
2006-09-04T06:43:00.000Z	EnsignRedshirt	markrian	Any pointers to how to clean the drive's lens?
2006-09-04T06:44:00.000Z	markrian	EnsignRedshirt	yup, you can buy a special type of disc with a small brush on it. You'd also get some cleaning fluid to put on the brush. Stick that in your drive and that's it cleaned
2006-09-04T06:44:00.000Z	markrian	EnsignRedshirt	It's unlikely the lens is dirty though - almost certainly the disks are the problem
2006-09-04T06:45:00.000Z	EnsignRedshirt	markrian	Well, I have one right here that I just tried to play, and it hung up at the menu...
2006-09-04T06:46:00.000Z	EnsignRedshirt	markrian	Good call... this disk doesn't look too pretty.
2006-09-04T06:53:00.000Z	EnsignRedshirt	markrian	Yup, diry disc appears to be the problem.  I wiped the disk with a damp tissue, and was able to get past the menu on the movie that just gave me an error.  I guess I should have checked that first...
2006-09-04T06:56:00.000Z	EnsignRedshirt	markrian	Thanks for the tips.  I hope the rest of scratches and gunk on the disc don't cause more problems.  Lawrence of Arabia calls... ciao.
