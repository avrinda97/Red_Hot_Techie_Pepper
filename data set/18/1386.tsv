2011-03-07T02:04:00.000Z	EDocTooR	ikonia	I reinstalled
2011-03-07T02:04:00.000Z	ikonia	EDocTooR	do you get the login box ?
2011-03-07T02:20:00.000Z	ikonia	EDocTooR	sounds like the video card is potentially part of the problem, what video card do you have ?
2011-03-07T02:21:00.000Z	EDocTooR	ikonia	Nvidia Geforce 6150se nforce 430 (note: I think your right... but I am using it now... so is there a workaround?)
2011-03-07T02:21:00.000Z	ikonia	EDocTooR	there are fallback/safe mode style video drivers, using them maybe a safer option
2011-03-07T02:25:00.000Z	EDocTooR	ikonia	so how do I check a log to see what the display error is?
2011-03-07T02:26:00.000Z	ikonia	EDocTooR	if your machine is hard locking, it will e pointless to look at log files
2011-03-07T02:27:00.000Z	ikonia	EDocTooR	why have you put that in a pastebin and sent it to me ? you've said that 10 times in the channel already
2011-03-07T02:29:00.000Z	ikonia	EDocTooR	as I've suggested force Xorg to use the fallback or "vesa" video driver
2011-03-07T02:30:00.000Z	ikonia	EDocTooR	you need to create an /etc/X11/xorg.conf file template ( many available on the web) that uses the driver "vesa"
2011-03-07T02:31:00.000Z	ikonia	EDocTooR	there may even still be an /etc/X11/xorg.filesafe file , copy that to /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2011-03-07T02:38:00.000Z	EDocTooR	ikonia	sorry but NO xorg.filesafe file
2011-03-07T02:38:00.000Z	ikonia	EDocTooR	ok, you need to create one as I suggested
2011-03-07T02:38:00.000Z	EDocTooR	ikonia	I am a noob... I don't know how to do that...
2011-03-07T02:39:00.000Z	ikonia	EDocTooR	what did I tell you to do and where to get it ?
2011-03-07T02:40:00.000Z	ikonia	EDocTooR	what did I tell you to do, and where did I tell you to get it ?
2011-03-07T02:41:00.000Z	ikonia	EDocTooR	ok, bye then
