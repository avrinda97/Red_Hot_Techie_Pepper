2005-04-12T12:20:00.000Z	ipcopnewbie		anybody willing to copy their unstable dist line from /etc/apt/sources.list for me?
2005-04-12T12:20:00.000Z	ipcopnewbie		(trying to apt-get install firestarter 1.0.3)
2005-04-12T12:21:00.000Z	topyli	ipcopnewbie	you mean you want to install firestarter from hoary onto a warty installation?
2005-04-12T12:24:00.000Z	ipcopnewbie	topyli	the version of firestarter in the ubuntu stable is < 1.0 so no dhcp config support
2005-04-12T12:24:00.000Z	ipcopnewbie	topyli	which i was hoping to use.
2005-04-12T12:24:00.000Z	topyli	ipcopnewbie	you could get the hoary source and build  a package on warty. it's more likely to succeed than trying to install the binary
2005-04-12T12:25:00.000Z	ipcopnewbie	topyli	i got the source from the firestarter home page, it failed tom configure with a perl dependency
2005-04-12T12:25:00.000Z	ipcopnewbie	topyli	i figured, before i went to a lot of hassle, maybe i could get apt-get to do it, just for this package
2005-04-12T12:25:00.000Z	topyli	ipcopnewbie	use debianized sources from hoary, they will build more easily (with apt)
2005-04-12T12:27:00.000Z	topyli	ipcopnewbie	insert the hoary source repository in your sources.list. then do 'apt-get build-depend firestarter'. then 'apt-get source -b firestarter' and voila! you have a working package
2005-04-12T12:27:00.000Z	ipcopnewbie	topyli	i'll give that a whirl. i haven't heard of the backports project... the first time i tried ubuntu was today. it's only the second debian installation i've done (much more experience w/rh)
2005-04-12T12:27:00.000Z	topyli	ipcopnewbie	well, you may find a backport too
2005-04-12T12:28:00.000Z	ipcopnewbie	topyli	did you say that firestarter is in universe? yes, i think thats the <1.0 version i got initially
2005-04-12T12:28:00.000Z	topyli	ipcopnewbie	i mean if you get the hoary source, that'll be in hoary universe as well :)
2005-04-12T12:31:00.000Z	topyli	ipcopnewbie	they do. but the hoary package probably won't work on warty, so you need to build one, or find a backport. i recommend building
2005-04-12T12:32:00.000Z	ipcopnewbie	topyli	ok, let me see if i can find a backport then.
2005-04-12T12:33:00.000Z	topyli	ipcopnewbie	happy hacking
2005-04-12T12:34:00.000Z	ipcopnewbie	topyli	thanks a ton! i love ubuntu so far! (loved debian previously, but that was my ISP's installation; love it slightly less now that I've actually tried doing a fresh install)
