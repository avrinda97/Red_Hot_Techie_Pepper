2005-12-15T06:49:00.000Z	dpupp_apache	rob_p	what was that command again?
2005-12-15T06:49:00.000Z	rob_p	dpupp_apache	 ls -ld /var/www
2005-12-15T06:50:00.000Z	rob_p	dpupp_apache	 Looks fine to me.  It's set to mode 755 which means everyone can read it.
2005-12-15T06:51:00.000Z	rob_p	dpupp_apache	 Go view your apache logs then.
2005-12-15T06:51:00.000Z	rob_p	dpupp_apache	 /var/log/apache or something...
2005-12-15T06:53:00.000Z	rob_p	dpupp_apache	 Your index.html file is readable by apache right?  (ex: chmod 644 index.html)
2005-12-15T06:54:00.000Z	rob_p	dpupp_apache	 That's why!
2005-12-15T06:54:00.000Z	rob_p	dpupp_apache	 change it to 644
2005-12-15T06:55:00.000Z	rob_p	dpupp_apache	 chmod 644 /var/www/index.html
2005-12-15T06:55:00.000Z	rob_p	dpupp_apache	 Well, they need to be readable if you want apache to serve them.
2005-12-15T06:59:00.000Z	dpupp_apache	rob_p	thanks for pointing me in the right direction. :) seems i need to learn a lot about permisions first.
2005-12-15T07:00:00.000Z	rob_p	dpupp_apache	 Sorry I stepped away...  Did you get it figured out?
2005-12-15T07:03:00.000Z	rob_p	dpupp_apache	 do, "sudo chmod 644 /var/www/*" and that will make all files within  /var/www readable.
2005-12-15T07:05:00.000Z	rob_p	dpupp_apache	 That's fine.
2005-12-15T07:12:00.000Z	rob_p	dpupp_apache	 If apache still can't serve up any content from your /var/www dir, then it's time to view your /var/log/apache/error.log for clues.  Apache's config files have many options and maybe something is not configured properly.
2005-12-15T07:15:00.000Z	rob_p	dpupp_apache	 Only if you changed the config file(s).  But it can't hurt to reload it (/etc/init.d/apache reload).
2005-12-15T07:16:00.000Z	rob_p	dpupp_apache	 Did apache's error log give you any clues?
2005-12-15T07:21:00.000Z	rob_p	dpupp_apache	 You're going to be most interested in the last few lines of the error log.  Anyway, good luck with it.  I'm sure you'll get it figured out.
