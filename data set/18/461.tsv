2012-02-08T21:20:00.000Z	EtgarDizz		hi all, I'm having trouble changing login window theme... the "login window" option doesn't exist in my "administration" menu, just "login screen"...
2012-02-08T21:21:00.000Z	Dr_willis1	EtgarDizz	 what ubuntu version are you using?
2012-02-08T21:22:00.000Z	EtgarDizz	Dr_willis1	11.04 with gnome classic theme
2012-02-08T21:23:00.000Z	Dr_willis1	EtgarDizz	 if its using the gdm3 - i dont think its very themeable at all.  you can do some minor changes - wallpaper and a few otehr things.
2012-02-08T21:23:00.000Z	Dr_willis1	EtgarDizz	 i recall some tricks to run   the gnome settings tools as the gdm user, that let you change the fonts and colors and a few other things.
2012-02-08T21:24:00.000Z	Dr_willis1	EtgarDizz	 but its a bit of a hassle
2012-02-08T21:25:00.000Z	EtgarDizz	Dr_willis1	so what needs to be different in my installation in order to see the login window options?
2012-02-08T21:26:00.000Z	Dr_willis1	EtgarDizz	 Not sure. I recall running the gnome settings as the gdm user and changeing the colors. and tweaking the default wallpaper.  I think theres some info on doing it on the webupd8 blog site and most likely on the askubuntu.com site. I use 11.10 now. so dont recall much about gdm3 tweaking.
2012-02-08T21:28:00.000Z	EtgarDizz	Dr_willis1	are you saying that 11.10 reverted back to the "login window" settings option under "administration"?
2012-02-08T21:29:00.000Z	Dr_willis1	EtgarDizz	 11.10 switched to lightdm - which is not very themeable at all either.  So i suggest not worrying about trying to theme the login screen, other then perhaps to change the wallpaper.
2012-02-08T21:29:00.000Z	Dr_willis1	EtgarDizz	 thats one reason i dont re,mer how to tweak gdm3 :)
2012-02-08T21:32:00.000Z	EtgarDizz	Dr_willis1	btw - how was the upgrade to 11.10? buggy? thinking about doing it but worried about it breaking all kinds of java/sdk/juniper/printer/sane/sensors/ati/..... stuff
2012-02-08T21:36:00.000Z	EtgarDizz	Dr_willis1	answer buggy as well ? :)
2012-02-08T21:38:00.000Z	Dr_willis1	EtgarDizz	 I always do clean installs. Ive had no issues with 11.10
2012-02-08T21:39:00.000Z	EtgarDizz	Dr_willis1	well that means you configure all your hardware from the start? not sure I'm up for that yet...
2012-02-08T21:39:00.000Z	Dr_willis1	EtgarDizz	 whats to configure?  I install my video card drivers.. and thats it..
2012-02-08T21:39:00.000Z	Dr_willis1	EtgarDizz	 from a empty hd to a working system.. perhaps 30 min tops..
2012-02-08T21:42:00.000Z	EtgarDizz	Dr_willis1	yes, the system boots fast alright, but I've had a lot of trouble cos I had to have both open&closed java, configuring printer properly, sensors for m/b, apache hosts... lots of stuff unfortunately. I'm pretty sure that backuping my home folder is not gonna be enough
