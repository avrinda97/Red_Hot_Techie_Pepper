2010-03-04T17:26:00.000Z	umbra_		making a  livecd based on ubuntu karmik, keep getting a popup on boot up stating "gvfsd-metadata closed unexpectedly".  Any ideas or suggestions incredibly appreciated.
2010-03-04T17:27:00.000Z	jimlovell777	umbra_	It's hard for anyone to help because we don't know what changes you've made.
2010-03-04T17:40:00.000Z	umbra_	jimlovell777	any idea where "ubuntu customization kit" might have some irc support?
2010-03-04T17:41:00.000Z	jimlovell777	umbra_	sorry but no, never hard of it
2010-03-04T17:45:00.000Z	jimlovell777	umbra_	Try the forums, people there can help
2010-03-04T17:45:00.000Z	umbra_	jimlovell777	thanks
2010-03-04T17:45:00.000Z	jimlovell777	umbra_	welcome
2010-03-04T19:17:00.000Z	umbra_	jimlovell777	 I wonder how many would have recognized it without the movie apollo 13. (I've actually got one of  Lovell's autographs)
2010-03-04T19:18:00.000Z	jimlovell777	umbra_	Do you really? Lucky. I'm headed to the cape this July for the second to last shuttle launch, very excited.
2010-03-04T19:19:00.000Z	umbra_	jimlovell777	excellent...last time I was down there was for glenn's return.
2010-03-04T19:20:00.000Z	jimlovell777	umbra_	Double lucky.
2010-03-04T19:22:00.000Z	umbra_	jimlovell777	you should meet a friend of mine.  He has autographs and mission patches from every known US space launch crew.
2010-03-04T19:23:00.000Z	jimlovell777	umbra_	:-O
2010-03-04T19:23:00.000Z	umbra_	jimlovell777	it's quite a collection.
2010-03-04T19:24:00.000Z	jimlovell777	umbra_	Certainly sounds like it.
2010-03-04T19:25:00.000Z	umbra_	jimlovell777	if you're into that sort of memorabilia thing hang on and i'll private message you something after i find it...
2010-03-04T19:25:00.000Z	jimlovell777	umbra_	Ok, thanks.
2010-03-04T19:30:00.000Z	umbra_	jimlovell777	hope that didn't overload your system
