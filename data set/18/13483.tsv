2005-11-17T14:41:00.000Z	sobersabre	{{corona}}	you need to boot with live CD and run fsck on your partitions.
2005-11-17T14:42:00.000Z	{{corona}}	sobersabre	is that the only way?
2005-11-17T14:42:00.000Z	sobersabre	{{corona}}	what do you mean ?
2005-11-17T14:43:00.000Z	{{corona}}	sobersabre	i dont have a live cd. is there any other method?
2005-11-17T14:44:00.000Z	sobersabre	{{corona}}	you can run kubuntu CD in "rescue mode"
2005-11-17T14:44:00.000Z	{{corona}}	sobersabre	by typing recue on boot menu?
2005-11-17T14:45:00.000Z	sobersabre	{{corona}}	i don't remember :) ... run F1 , F2 etc  to read the instruc tions
2005-11-17T14:45:00.000Z	{{corona}}	sobersabre	i tried that but got a bit confused because it started doing hardware checks etc...it looked like it was going to install kubuntu (am i being stupid?)
2005-11-17T14:46:00.000Z	sobersabre	{{corona}}	don't get confused: just read the instructions.
2005-11-17T14:46:00.000Z	{{corona}}	sobersabre	so i boot from the cd i installed kubuntu?
2005-11-17T14:48:00.000Z	sobersabre	{{corona}}	... I think i've said that...
2005-11-17T14:49:00.000Z	{{corona}}	sobersabre	thank you, i shall try
2005-11-17T15:00:00.000Z	{{corona}}	sobersabre	hi sorry just anotherquery: can i use another distro live cd like linxBBC to clean up my filesystem?
2005-11-17T15:00:00.000Z	sobersabre	{{corona}}	as long as filesystem tools don't have a too old or too new filesystem, you're OK to use them,
2005-11-17T15:01:00.000Z	{{corona}}	sobersabre	ok thanks
