2006-05-01T08:53:00.000Z	N2DIY	intelikey	there is no /install/initrd.img on the cd, and /isolinux/isolinux.cfg just display the file contents.
2006-05-01T09:54:00.000Z	intelikey	N2DIY	why mess with a GUI when you have linux ?
2006-05-01T09:55:00.000Z	N2DIY	intelikey	egzeck, urbuartic, yes apt-get has a gui, and yes you can do more with eight fingers and two thumbs.
2006-05-01T10:02:00.000Z	N2DIY	intelikey	dual boot won't work if winders is the second install, always install linux last.
2006-05-01T10:04:00.000Z	intelikey	N2DIY	he said it's on the first partition
2006-05-01T10:05:00.000Z	N2DIY	intelikey	doesn't matter, that is where the mbr are is, and that is what winders is going to grab.
2006-05-01T10:07:00.000Z	intelikey	N2DIY	no not a reload  just reinstall grub/lilo  or what ever boot loader he uses.
2006-05-01T10:07:00.000Z	N2DIY	intelikey	ok, I don't know alot about this, just what I've read, I don't mess with dual boot systems.
2006-05-01T10:10:00.000Z	N2DIY	intelikey	and I hope your right, I've savaged some winder boxes, and had to run debug on hard drive to get them bootable with linux.
2006-05-01T10:14:00.000Z	N2DIY	intelikey	what happened, I said I didn't know how to do it?
