2008-07-02T02:12:00.000Z	spoon_man	Blais1	have you seen http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Ubuntu_Hardy_Installation_Guide
2008-07-02T02:12:00.000Z	Blais1	spoon_man	That's what I  followed
2008-07-02T02:13:00.000Z	Blais1	spoon_man	I have 2 Device sections in my xorg.conf would this cause problems?

2008-07-02T02:19:00.000Z	spoon_man	Blais1	and you removed the xserver-xgl package?
2008-07-02T02:20:00.000Z	Blais1	spoon_man	I don't have it, I'm pretty sure
2008-07-02T02:21:00.000Z	Blais1	spoon_man	Are there meant to be so many 0's in my xorg.conf after my ati device?
2008-07-02T02:22:00.000Z	spoon_man	Blais1	I wouldn't worry about it
2008-07-02T02:22:00.000Z	Blais1	spoon_man	ok.  here's the output of my fglrxinfo http://paste.ubuntu.com/24335/
2008-07-02T02:24:00.000Z	spoon_man	Blais1	you may want to consider reinstalling the drivers with EnvyNG, keeping in mind that this option isn't supported
2008-07-02T02:24:00.000Z	Blais1	spoon_man	Well I'm concerned to install so many different things on top of eacch other
2008-07-02T02:26:00.000Z	spoon_man	Blais1	EnvyNG will remove your current driver setup and replace it with its own
2008-07-02T02:26:00.000Z	Blais1	spoon_man	how would you recommend installing it then?
2008-07-02T02:27:00.000Z	spoon_man	Blais1	EnvyNG can be obtained through Synaptic
2008-07-02T02:30:00.000Z	Blais1	spoon_man	spanther, if I end up with a black screen I'll be very upset :(
2008-07-02T02:31:00.000Z	Blais1	spoon_man	Envy only has version 8.4 though, I want to use 8.6
2008-07-02T02:34:00.000Z	Blais1	spoon_man	envy gave an error during it's driver installation, :S
