2008-06-19T21:32:00.000Z	hittingpilot	nickrud	dunno really never looked into to it, but it's on a dell latitude
2008-06-19T21:34:00.000Z	hittingpilot	nickrud	do you have anything for me?
2008-06-19T21:35:00.000Z	nickrud	hittingpilot	you should be able to use   system->admin->hardware drivers, select nvidia and reboot. You should see compiz in action as soon as you log in. If you don't see your card in hardware driver, try sudo apt-get install linux-restricted-modules-$(uname -r) , and look again
2008-06-19T21:36:00.000Z	hittingpilot	nickrud	how similar is compiz to the beryl interface?
2008-06-19T21:36:00.000Z	nickrud	hittingpilot	extremely
2008-06-19T21:39:00.000Z	hittingpilot	nickrud	does it still have the 3d cubes?
2008-06-19T21:39:00.000Z	nickrud	hittingpilot	yes. It has all that beryl had, plus more
2008-06-19T21:40:00.000Z	nickrud	hittingpilot	install compizconfig-settings-manager , you'll have a new prefs menu item, Advanced Desktop
2008-06-19T21:54:00.000Z	hittingpilot	nickrud	i like compiz, but the 3d widow pop out is bothering me
