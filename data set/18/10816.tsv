2006-10-22T12:11:00.000Z	AdamKili		how can i test if ubuntu knows my windows key is there? i want to assign the command 3ddesk to it
2006-10-22T12:12:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	AdamKili	it does... it's called the Super Key, by the way
2006-10-22T12:13:00.000Z	AdamKili	BHSPitLappy	how can i test? and in this guide i got it calls it Super_L
2006-10-22T12:13:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	AdamKili	that makes sense, super left
2006-10-22T12:15:00.000Z	AdamKili	BHSPitLappy	i only have one windows key so should i leave off the _L?
2006-10-22T12:15:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	AdamKili	doubtful.
2006-10-22T12:17:00.000Z	AdamKili	BHSPitLappy	i guess i'll try _L and _R and see which works
2006-10-22T12:18:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	AdamKili	the Right one may be the "menu" iconned one
2006-10-22T12:27:00.000Z	AdamKili	BHSPitLappy	Super, Super_L, and Super_R don't work. but i tested <Control>a and it worked, so my windows key must not be recognised as Super_L/R
2006-10-22T12:28:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	AdamKili	you've tried the keyboard shortcuts preferences in GNOME, right?
2006-10-22T12:28:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	AdamKili	System>Preferences>Keyboard Shortcuts?
2006-10-22T12:29:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	AdamKili	my "windows key" is Super_L, according to that
2006-10-22T12:30:00.000Z	AdamKili	BHSPitLappy	which shortcut is it under?
2006-10-22T12:31:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	AdamKili	just pick one of the items, and hit your button
2006-10-22T12:33:00.000Z	AdamKili	BHSPitLappy	doesn't do anything
2006-10-22T12:35:00.000Z	AdamKili	BHSPitLappy	it doesn't do anything, so i guess linux doesn't recognize my super key?
2006-10-22T12:36:00.000Z	BHSPitLappy	AdamKili	perhaps not?
2006-10-22T12:42:00.000Z	AdamKili	BHSPitLappy	any idea how to fix that?
