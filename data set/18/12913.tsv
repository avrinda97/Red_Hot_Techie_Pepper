2006-03-24T09:36:00.000Z	gopi		ubuntu-5.10-install-i386.iso  <----- This one I can install in my Athlon64 system ???
2006-03-24T09:36:00.000Z	gopi		Anyone  please ?
2006-03-24T09:37:00.000Z	ipfw	gopi	yeah, you can use that ISO to make a CD to install on your athlon64 system.. It will only run as x86, and not x86_64 though
2006-03-24T09:37:00.000Z	ipfw	gopi	so the amd64 processor will be running in 32bit mode
2006-03-24T09:37:00.000Z	gopi	ipfw	Oh okay !! Thanks
2006-03-24T09:41:00.000Z	ipfw	gopi	: name would be something like: ubuntu-5.10-install-amd64.iso
2006-03-24T09:52:00.000Z	ipfw	gopi	: it can, might need a codec package though
2006-03-24T09:52:00.000Z	gopi	ipfw	what should I get then?
2006-03-24T09:58:00.000Z	ipfw	gopi	: there is a new program called "easybuntu", if you install it -- It can setup/install loads of common programs correctly for you
2006-03-24T09:58:00.000Z	ipfw	gopi	: I recommend it... want me to google search for the link ?
2006-03-24T09:58:00.000Z	gopi	ipfw	sure
2006-03-24T09:58:00.000Z	ipfw	gopi	: I got it that time, _jason let me know I was typing it wrong :P
2006-03-24T09:59:00.000Z	gopi	ipfw	But totem-xine is a media player similar to totem movie player ?
2006-03-24T09:59:00.000Z	ipfw	gopi	: out of everything listed, I would recommend installing everything it has to offer *Except the ATI drivers*, and thats just because it locks my system when I try them ;)
2006-03-24T10:00:00.000Z	ipfw	gopi	: yes, totem is the frontend, and totem-xine uses xine-lib to play movies :)
2006-03-24T10:02:00.000Z	ipfw	gopi	: its probobaly more that your system isn't pointing to the installed codecs like it should, running the easyubuntu installer will fix that for you :)
2006-03-24T10:02:00.000Z	ipfw	gopi	: just trust me, its magic
2006-03-24T10:03:00.000Z	gopi	ipfw	ok thanks
