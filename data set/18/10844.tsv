2006-10-18T09:53:00.000Z	ReverseBlade	fredl	remove all extra repos, remove purge all php, then re install it
2006-10-18T09:54:00.000Z	ReverseBlade	fredl	just make sure you don'T have any extra repos i
2006-10-18T09:54:00.000Z	fredl	ReverseBlade	I checked, in my sources.list all the old repos are out
2006-10-18T09:55:00.000Z	ReverseBlade	fredl	not old ones, just remove the non standard ones
