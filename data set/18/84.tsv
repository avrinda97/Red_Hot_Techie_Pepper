2012-09-27T22:42:00.000Z	ikonia	adami1097	just reboot your machine
2012-09-27T22:42:00.000Z	ikonia	adami1097	how to reboot your machine ?
2012-09-27T22:43:00.000Z	ikonia	adami1097	sudo reboot
2012-09-27T22:46:00.000Z	ikonia	adami1097	what ?
2012-09-27T22:46:00.000Z	ikonia	adami1097	because you rebooted your machine which kills everything on your machine
2012-09-27T22:46:00.000Z	ikonia	adami1097	yes, znc is not installed, it's not running
2012-09-27T22:46:00.000Z	ikonia	adami1097	you need to start it
2012-09-27T22:47:00.000Z	ikonia	adami1097	depends how you installed it
2012-09-27T22:47:00.000Z	ikonia	adami1097	look you shouldn't be running a server
2012-09-27T22:47:00.000Z	ikonia	adami1097	sorry to be harsh - but this is a mess
2012-09-27T22:47:00.000Z	ikonia	adami1097	it depends
2012-09-27T22:48:00.000Z	ikonia	adami1097	if you can't run the basics of a server, it's not wise
2012-09-27T22:48:00.000Z	ikonia	adami1097	I don't believe you should be running a server, so I'm going to leave you to it
2012-09-27T22:48:00.000Z	ikonia	adami1097	please don't type in caps. I'm not going to help you - others may, so be patient
2012-09-27T22:49:00.000Z	adami1097	ikonia	please help me
2012-09-27T22:49:00.000Z	ikonia	adami1097	I won't say again. No. Others may, so be patient
