2012-02-07T18:18:00.000Z	dimago	auronandace	yes, by libre it appear, but it not the same when I open by firefox...
2012-02-07T18:18:00.000Z	dimago	auronandace	are differents windows...
2012-02-07T18:19:00.000Z	auronandace	dimago	yes, each app capable of printing has their own printer preferences
2012-02-07T18:20:00.000Z	dimago	auronandace	maybe I need a driver for this? reisio, what do you think?
2012-02-07T18:21:00.000Z	auronandace	dimago	you've already got your printer driver
2012-02-07T18:21:00.000Z	auronandace	dimago	lexmark are an awful brand
2012-02-07T18:22:00.000Z	dimago	auronandace	ok... I will look for a driver for ubuntu
2012-02-07T18:23:00.000Z	auronandace	dimago	you said your printer prints just fine, that means you have the driver installed, you don't need to get another driver
2012-02-07T18:25:00.000Z	dimago	auronandace	but it should be a generic driver, nah?
2012-02-07T18:25:00.000Z	auronandace	dimago	what driver did you install?
2012-02-07T18:25:00.000Z	dimago	auronandace	because I dont have many option when I access my printer by System

2012-02-07T18:26:00.000Z	dimago	auronandace	how can I see my driver model?
2012-02-07T18:26:00.000Z	auronandace	dimago	so it's whatever is in cups
