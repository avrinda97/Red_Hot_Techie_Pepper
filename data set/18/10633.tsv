2007-10-26T05:39:00.000Z	angerbuntu		so apparently anything named .cgwdtheme is incompatible with compiz-fusion or what
2007-10-26T05:39:00.000Z	angerbuntu		ive installed the compizconfig-settings-manager
2007-10-26T05:39:00.000Z	angerbuntu		and still no go with my damn themes!
2007-10-26T05:39:00.000Z	angerbuntu		i want to cry so bad
2007-10-26T05:39:00.000Z	angerbuntu		but my emotions are destroyed
2007-10-26T05:41:00.000Z	angerbuntu		if anyone has a block of ice,  you can throw it at my face now
2007-10-26T05:41:00.000Z	angerbuntu		ive seriously been configuring this computer for the past 6-7 hours
2007-10-26T05:42:00.000Z	angerbuntu		ive tried beryl
2007-10-26T05:42:00.000Z	angerbuntu		and ive tried compiz
2007-10-26T05:42:00.000Z	angerbuntu		none work
2007-10-26T05:43:00.000Z	Jordan_U	angerbuntu	Do you have emerald theme manager installed?
2007-10-26T05:43:00.000Z	Jordan_U	angerbuntu	Install it with Applications -> Add /Remove or Synaptic / apt
2007-10-26T06:01:00.000Z	Jordan_U	angerbuntu	What's wrong?
2007-10-26T06:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	angerbuntu	Compiz doesn't use Emerald by default, you probably just need to start emerald
2007-10-26T06:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	angerbuntu	Did you run "emerald --replace" ?
2007-10-26T06:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	angerbuntu	Also I think that you can switch to it with the Compiz Fusion icon in the panel
2007-10-26T06:06:00.000Z	Jordan_U	angerbuntu	There is a GUI setting for it somewhere ( again, I think in the icon in the top panel ) but if you want to do it manually just add "emerald --replace" to System -> Preferences -> Session
2007-10-26T06:09:00.000Z	Jordan_U	angerbuntu	I have not used Compiz Fusion yet but in Beryl there was an icon in the top panel, I think it is now called "fusion-icon"
