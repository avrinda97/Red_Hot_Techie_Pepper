2007-10-06T14:06:00.000Z	punzada	dissection	you should make sure your swap partition is listed in your /etc/fstab
2007-10-06T14:07:00.000Z	punzada		I actually perfer to just use a swap file rather then a partition, always makes the most sense to me with modern components
2007-10-06T14:08:00.000Z	dissection	punzada	This is what I have in fstab...... # /dev/sda4

2007-10-06T14:08:00.000Z	dissection		Woops, sorry I thought that'll be one line
2007-10-06T14:09:00.000Z	punzada		the less gui tools the better in my opinion, config files are written and commented so well it makes things so simple that way
2007-10-06T14:11:00.000Z	dissection	punzada	is that right?
2007-10-06T14:14:00.000Z	punzada	dissection	by typing 'free' in terminal it recognizes the swap is there correct
2007-10-06T14:14:00.000Z	punzada		?
2007-10-06T14:14:00.000Z	dissection	punzada	Yes, it shows up there but used is 0.
2007-10-06T14:14:00.000Z	punzada		how much ram is used?
2007-10-06T14:16:00.000Z	punzada		no , it's not that non-geeks don't want to use the command line, it's that windows users don't want to use the command line
2007-10-06T14:16:00.000Z	punzada		that's a big difference.
2007-10-06T14:22:00.000Z	punzada	dissection	you still having issues?
2007-10-06T14:22:00.000Z	dissection	punzada	Well it continues to show the swap usage as 0. I don't know if that has got anything to do with Ubuntu freezing all the time. No one's been able to find me a solution till now.
