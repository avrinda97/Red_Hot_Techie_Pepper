2007-05-29T13:37:00.000Z	SgtFox		Hey guys, I'm in need of a bit of help if anyone could spare a few mins - I'm stuck on a Ubuntu LiveCD after installing it screwed my mbr
2007-05-29T13:38:00.000Z	SgtFox		if anyone could tell me how to use root permissions on a LiveCD, or fixmbr my vista installation I'd be massively grateful
2007-05-29T13:39:00.000Z	SgtFox		well, it gives me Error 17
2007-05-29T13:40:00.000Z	SgtFox		I'm a massive Linux n00b, despite being good with Windows, so sudo / mounting installations is a bit foreign to me
2007-05-29T13:41:00.000Z	SgtFox		I've given Ubuntu its own hard drive
2007-05-29T13:41:00.000Z	SgtFox		Vista has the main HDD
