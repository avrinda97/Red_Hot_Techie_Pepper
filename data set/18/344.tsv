2012-04-05T12:37:00.000Z	dcUnit3d		i would really reallly reallly appreciate it if someone could help me
2012-04-05T12:38:00.000Z	dcUnit3d		i hosed my ubuntu by canceling an apt-get update
2012-04-05T12:38:00.000Z	dcUnit3d		and i'm trying to repair it with a Live CD
2012-04-05T12:38:00.000Z	ikonia	dcUnit3d	it's going to take a fair ammount of effort to resolve that
2012-04-05T12:41:00.000Z	ikonia	dcUnit3d	fixing these things from this point of view is normally a big ammount of effort and takes a reasonable level of experience
2012-04-05T12:41:00.000Z	ikonia	dcUnit3d	you may want to consider backing up your data (while you have a livecd) and then just re-installing
2012-04-05T12:42:00.000Z	dcUnit3d	ikonia	the only issue i would have with that is that there was one night where i spent literally 12 hours getting my dual graphics card to work.
2012-04-05T12:43:00.000Z	ikonia	dcUnit3d	so backup your xorg.conf
2012-04-05T12:43:00.000Z	dcUnit3d	ikonia	i think i would know how to get it to work now, but still.
2012-04-05T12:43:00.000Z	ikonia	dcUnit3d	ok, so you can spend hours trying to fix your in flux system, or you could spend 30 minutes re-installing then 30 minutes applying your settings/restoring your data
2012-04-05T12:44:00.000Z	dcUnit3d	ikonia	it was more than that, i have to install nvidia drivers, etc etc.
2012-04-05T12:44:00.000Z	dcUnit3d	ikonia	i have everything on a second partition
2012-04-05T12:44:00.000Z	ikonia	dcUnit3d	great, so 30 minutes re-installing then
2012-04-05T12:47:00.000Z	dcUnit3d	ikonia	ok thats what ill do.  thanks for the advice.
2012-04-05T12:47:00.000Z	ikonia	dcUnit3d	I know it's not "cool" but it will give you a solid stable, working system in 30 minutes, rather than a working system that may have problems after 5 hours of trying to work it out
2012-04-05T12:49:00.000Z	dcUnit3d	ikonia	that's true.  just a little frustrated.  not what i wanted to do tonight, was going to set up a git server on here.  just needed to change my monitor.  i really do appreciate it though.  thanks.
2012-04-05T12:49:00.000Z	ikonia	dcUnit3d	if you are going to use this for work, eg run a git server so you can do work, get a stable box
2012-04-05T12:49:00.000Z	ikonia	dcUnit3d	as in re-install to get a stable box
