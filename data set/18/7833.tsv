2007-12-05T05:33:00.000Z	tony_math		Where does apt keep it's configuration files? The files where Synaptic Package Manager would store the entries in the Preferences dialog window?
2007-12-05T05:33:00.000Z	tony_math		They're not in /etc/apt
2007-12-05T05:34:00.000Z	jrib	tony_math	why?
2007-12-05T05:35:00.000Z	tony_math	jrib	I can't make any changes to the preferences using the GUI. The application just hangs and I have to kill it.
2007-12-05T05:35:00.000Z	jrib	tony_math	run it in a terminal
2007-12-05T05:36:00.000Z	tony_math	jrib	So right now I can't install anything since I can't remove the "proxy" setting in the preferences section of Synaptic.
2007-12-05T05:36:00.000Z	jrib	tony_math	you can use apt on the command line
2007-12-05T05:37:00.000Z	tony_math	jrib	will do. Thanks
2007-12-05T05:38:00.000Z	tony_math	jrib	I saw the message. However, looks like my GUI application is broken.
2007-12-05T05:38:00.000Z	jrib	tony_math	you haven't run it in a terminal yet
2007-12-05T05:39:00.000Z	tony_math	jrib	the problem is that at work, I need to set a proxy server connection, which I don't need at home. So, I normally make this change using the Preferences dialog window.
2007-12-05T05:40:00.000Z	jrib	tony_math	ok
2007-12-05T05:40:00.000Z	jrib	tony_math	I mean, run the dialog from the terminal so you can look for error messages
2007-12-05T05:44:00.000Z	jrib	tony_math	so you have to kill it now?
2007-12-05T05:44:00.000Z	jrib	tony_math	you can use apt
2007-12-05T05:45:00.000Z	tony_math	jrib	how do I use apt-get to install the software updates?
2007-12-05T05:46:00.000Z	jrib	tony_math	sudo aptitude update && sudo aptitude upgrade  (or apt-get if you prefer it)
2007-12-05T05:47:00.000Z	tony_math	jrib	Thanks :) Your comands worked. I had about 38 updates pending and now they're downloading and preparing for install.
