2008-02-22T23:59:00.000Z	erUSUL	bluefoxx	o.O and sda and sdb are your sata devices? optical drive and disk??
2008-02-23T00:01:00.000Z	bluefoxx	erUSUL	sda is my sata, which will only detected every 20 bootups, and sdb was usually the scsi drive, i only have one sata drive right now[else i would use raid], hda and hdb are my IDE drives, hdd/c should be my [crappy] cd drive
2008-02-23T00:06:00.000Z	erUSUL	bluefoxx	you seem to have multiple problems on the sata disks are you sure everything can be tracked down to crappy cabling??
2008-02-23T00:08:00.000Z	bluefoxx	erUSUL	it may be the onboard sata controller as a crappy sound card prevented my system from booting up for a while, as i removed hardware one piece at a  time, while the card was in my system the satawouldnt work at all
2008-03-03T23:19:00.000Z	erUSUL	bluefoxx	wtf!! if it is no joke ... no no good at all
