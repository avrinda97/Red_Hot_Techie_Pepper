2009-08-26T21:26:00.000Z	mazda01	llutz	i figured it out, to transfer from local host to remote host I did this: scp sbackup.conf fred@machine1:/home/fred
2009-08-26T21:26:00.000Z	llutz	mazda01	right, mine was from remote to local

2010-01-22T17:41:00.000Z	llutz	mazda01	all the same crap today
2010-01-22T17:43:00.000Z	llutz	mazda01	just buy one, use recommended media and hope it will work. times are gone whit significant differences in quality etc between burners
2010-01-22T17:44:00.000Z	llutz	mazda01	maybe look that firmware-updates don't need windows (samsung-like)
2010-01-22T17:46:00.000Z	llutz	mazda01	sata, pata is dead
2010-01-22T17:51:00.000Z	llutz	mazda01	most companies have lists of media you should use with a specific drive. use them
2010-01-22T17:52:00.000Z	mazda01	llutz	i am going with a lite-on DH-24AAS and I don't see anywhere on the tigerdirect website that says what media to use. maybe i need to check manufactureers website?
2010-01-22T17:53:00.000Z	llutz	mazda01	old stand-alone dvd-player had some compatibility-problems with +r, so -R was preferred. shouldn't make any difference today
2010-01-22T17:53:00.000Z	llutz	mazda01	manufacturers site should offer those lists
2010-01-22T18:01:00.000Z	mazda01	llutz	many people still have the old stand alone dvd player so i'll get dvd-r just in case
2010-01-22T18:02:00.000Z	llutz	mazda01	i never had that issue, but i'm watching video not very often
2011-12-06T14:02:00.000Z	mazda01	llutz	there;s definitely no progress of anything. LOL
2011-12-06T14:12:00.000Z	mazda01	llutz	so is there another way to make sure a stupid gpt partition table gets removed then? can I just kill the dd command?
2011-12-06T14:20:00.000Z	mazda01	llutz	thanks
