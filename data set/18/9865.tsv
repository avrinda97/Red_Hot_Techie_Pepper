2007-02-10T17:55:00.000Z	quaal		i found a poweriso linux version. how do you make a program so that you can just type 'programname' anywhere in the prompt to use it
2007-02-10T17:56:00.000Z	jowi_realone	quaal	add the directory to the path. if you want it system wide use /etc/environment
2007-02-10T17:56:00.000Z	quaal	jowi_realone	so putting the program in /etc/environment will make it available anywhere in the terminal..
2007-02-10T17:57:00.000Z	jowi_realone	quaal	yes. have a look at /etc/environment and it will become clear.
2007-02-10T17:57:00.000Z	quaal	jowi_realone	thanks alt
2007-02-10T17:58:00.000Z	jowi_realone	quaal	no, not putting the program there. put the path to the program in that file
2007-02-10T17:58:00.000Z	quaal	jowi_realone	now i see, /environment is a file not a dir
2007-02-10T17:58:00.000Z	quaal	jowi_realone	hmm
2007-02-10T17:59:00.000Z	quaal	jowi_realone	this is the only entry i have PATH="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin/X11:/usr/games"
2007-02-10T06:00:00.000Z	jowi_realone	quaal	normal. at the end of the PATH=".... line add ":/here/is/my/program/located"
2007-02-10T06:00:00.000Z	quaal	jowi_realone	ok
2007-02-10T06:00:00.000Z	jowi_realone	quaal	or you can just put the program itself in /usr/local/bin
2007-02-10T06:01:00.000Z	quaal	jowi_realone	ok..
2007-02-10T06:01:00.000Z	jowi_realone	quaal	(as you can see in the PATH line in /etc/environment, /usr/local/bin is already there so can chose how you want to do it)
2007-02-10T06:02:00.000Z	quaal	jowi_realone	right
2007-02-10T06:03:00.000Z	quaal	jowi_realone	where is the best place to put programs that must be installed manually? i've been using /home/username as it seems that is where most of the programs instlaled from repository go
2007-02-10T06:04:00.000Z	jowi_realone	quaal	as bruenig none of them installs in your home. myself, I use /opt to install my own programs in.
