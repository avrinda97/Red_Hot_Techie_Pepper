2009-08-02T11:53:00.000Z	vir1omi		i am trying to install frostwire on top jaunty, and i am having some issues. after clicking download from frostwires site it opened the window to down load it through GDebi package installer. and after clicking install it claims i cant install it as there is another package manager open. however i do not obviously have one open and i checked in the terminal for any of the package managers for it and couldnt find something that seemed obviou
