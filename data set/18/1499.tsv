2011-12-28T11:39:00.000Z	bullgard4		[Ubuntu 11.10 GNOME Shell 3.2.1] I am recording an internet radio stream. Why can I not hear it at the same time? Pressing Windows-key > gnome-control-center > Audio > Applications > ALSA plugin [firefox] is not muted. (Last night it worked.)
2011-12-28T11:41:00.000Z	lorddelta	bullgard4	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SoundTroubleshooting <-- Invaluable help
2011-12-28T11:48:00.000Z	bullgard4	lorddelta	"Invaluable" is the proper word here: You never know if it is of value to you. The webpage you recommended is for GNOME 2 and not for GNOME 3.
2011-12-28T11:49:00.000Z	bullgard4	lorddelta	The steps 1 through 5 are all positively fulfilled.
2011-12-28T11:49:00.000Z	lorddelta	bullgard4	mmm...no...most of that should work at the driver level...if that's your problem that is.
2011-12-28T11:49:00.000Z	bullgard4	lorddelta	I do not have a driver problem. As I said, it worked last night.
2011-12-28T11:50:00.000Z	lorddelta	bullgard4	Yeah, I know, there's been a bug that I haven't been able to/tried much to pin down where the configuration seems to corrupt...
2011-12-28T11:50:00.000Z	lorddelta	bullgard4	Easiest way I find to deal with it is use a utility like alsamixer.
2011-12-28T11:56:00.000Z	lorddelta	bullgard4	However you also failed to give me any particulars about the streamer you are using and what parameters/options you are using, so I could imagine that the sound itself is fine and that you accidentally clicked an option.
2011-12-28T11:57:00.000Z	lorddelta	bullgard4	For instance with vlc there is an option you must select to make loopback streamed audio when saving to disk.
2011-12-28T11:58:00.000Z	bullgard4	lorddelta	I am using VLC media player as streamer.
2011-12-28T11:58:00.000Z	lorddelta	bullgard4	Version?
2011-12-28T11:59:00.000Z	bullgard4	lorddelta	For Ubuntu 11.10 the current VLC media player version is 1.1.12.
2011-12-28T12:06:00.000Z	lorddelta	bullgard4	I'm presuming you've tried the obvious then, namely that it doesn't work with other radio stations, that vlc can in fact play audio
2011-12-28T12:07:00.000Z	lorddelta	bullgard4	I would say that if you can get vlc to play audio, the problem is not ubuntu's or your sound drivers; I would take it up with vlc (try #vlc)
2011-12-28T12:09:00.000Z	bullgard4	lorddelta	I agree: My problem is not with Ubuntu nor with my sound driver. A very good advice: I will try #vlc. --  Thank you very much for your help.

2011-12-28T12:17:00.000Z	lorddelta	bullgard4	Hopefully more concise than me rambling on to you. :)
