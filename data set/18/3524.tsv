2009-11-07T02:44:00.000Z	Alan502	LjL	i am aware about it. I can install the driver from the console but how do i kill X????
2009-11-07T02:45:00.000Z	LjL	Alan502	you've been answere4d by hassanakevazir. another way is "sudo invoke-rc.d gdm stop", and yet another on karmic should be "sudo stop gdm".
2009-11-07T02:50:00.000Z	Alan502	LjL	hassanakevazir, when execute: "alan@alan-desktop:~$ sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop
2009-11-07T02:51:00.000Z	LjL	Alan502	uhm, do you use Ubuntu or some of its variants?
2009-11-07T02:51:00.000Z	Alan502	LjL	i use kubuntu :)
2009-11-07T02:51:00.000Z	LjL	Alan502	then "sudo service kdm stop"
2009-11-07T02:51:00.000Z	Alan502	LjL	ah thanks
2009-11-07T02:54:00.000Z	Alan502	LjL	the installer still prompts im using an X server; do you think is an error in the script?
2009-11-07T02:55:00.000Z	LjL	Alan502	possibly. why are you installing a video driver that comes with a separate installing, rather than using the ones bundled in ubuntu repositories, to begin with?
2009-11-07T02:56:00.000Z	Alan502	LjL	well i wanted to have the lastest driver; and downloading the one that comes in the ubuntu repositories will mean an extra hour of downloading
2009-11-07T02:56:00.000Z	LjL	Alan502	well, i can only say 1) "latest" is not always "better" 2) it's often proven to be a bad idea to use drivers outside of the repos
2009-11-07T02:57:00.000Z	Alan502	LjL	ok thanks :D i will install the one in the repos anyway
2009-11-07T03:08:00.000Z	Alan502	LjL	i have activated the driver that comes in the repositories. I can now configure the second monitor on the X Server Settings; however when i reboot the settings reset. My guess is that i must save the settings to the Xorg configuration file but the following error prompts: " Failed to parse existing X config file '/etc/X11/xorg.conf" do you know if i can fix this?
2009-11-07T03:10:00.000Z	LjL	Alan502	unfortunately, my experience has been that it's very annoying to switch resolutions... and they've changed the way things are done in that respect on the latest versions of ubuntu (which i haven't really used). i'd tell you to try doing « sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg », but that might possibly be counterproductive
2009-11-07T03:10:00.000Z	Alan502	LjL	ok thanks anyway for your knowledge :D
