2008-06-17T09:33:00.000Z	bakersfieldboy		is it a good idea to install windows over ubuntu dual boot ubuntu being frist
2008-06-17T09:33:00.000Z	dmsuperman	bakersfieldboy	many people have said it's a pain, but assuming your windows is XP I find it muuuuch easier to do it the way you asked
2008-06-17T09:34:00.000Z	dmsuperman	bakersfieldboy	I installed Ubuntu first, then Windows, and all I had to do was reinstall GRUB after windows took the liberty of overwriting it and it works fine now
2008-06-17T09:35:00.000Z	bakersfieldboy		yes its xp,i did do a dual boot windows being frist but ubuntu is up and got alot i want to keep
2008-06-17T09:35:00.000Z	dmsuperman	bakersfieldboy	so you have windows already installed? or ubuntu installed?
2008-06-17T09:36:00.000Z	bakersfieldboy		just Ubuntu
2008-06-17T09:36:00.000Z	dmsuperman	bakersfieldboy	yeah...it's easy. Just resize your partition to allow room for windows, install windows to the empty portion. Windows will overwrite grub in the mbr, so you have to repair GRUB after you install windows but once you do that you'll have both your current ubuntu and your new windows xp installs dual boot
2008-06-17T09:37:00.000Z	bakersfieldboy		ok thinks,can i use ubuntu disk to repair the mbr
2008-06-17T09:38:00.000Z	dmsuperman	bakersfieldboy	yup. Just google "repair grub ubuntu livecd" and i think the first result is a great guide to walk you through it
2008-06-17T09:38:00.000Z	bakersfieldboy		ty iam on it
2008-06-17T09:41:00.000Z	bakersfieldboy	dmsuperman	i think i just notice something em i right? by putting your name frist it helps changer the color to be idenfi
2008-06-17T09:42:00.000Z	bakersfieldboy		maybe not sry
2008-06-17T09:42:00.000Z	dmsuperman	bakersfieldboy	yup

2008-06-17T09:56:00.000Z	bakersfieldboy	dmsuperman	are you still here ?
2008-06-17T09:57:00.000Z	bakersfieldboy		is this the right way to reload grub ?
