2012-02-16T11:38:00.000Z	ChipCherou	Ben64	fglrx
2012-02-16T11:37:00.000Z	Ben64	ChipCherou	which nvidia driver is it attempting to load
2012-02-16T11:38:00.000Z	Ben64	ChipCherou	fglrx isn't nvidia
2012-02-16T11:39:00.000Z	ChipCherou	Ben64	2 lines down it says Failed to initialize GLX extension (Compatible NVIDIA X driver not found).
2012-02-16T11:39:00.000Z	ChipCherou	Ben64	this aside, how do I tell it to use 'radeon'
2012-02-16T11:39:00.000Z	Ben64	ChipCherou	2 lines of what? down from what?
2012-02-16T11:40:00.000Z	ChipCherou	Ben64	the startx output
2012-02-16T11:40:00.000Z	Ben64	ChipCherou	did you have an nvidia card previously?
2012-02-16T11:40:00.000Z	ChipCherou	Ben64	yes
2012-02-16T11:41:00.000Z	Ben64	ChipCherou	then you need to remove the nvidia drivers via apt-get
2012-02-16T11:41:00.000Z	ChipCherou	Ben64	isn't there a way for me to force x to load radeon drivers instead (this linux jumps between ati and nvidia)
2012-02-16T11:42:00.000Z	Ben64	ChipCherou	you can create an xorg.conf
2012-02-16T11:42:00.000Z	ChipCherou	Ben64	in /etc/X11?
2012-02-16T11:42:00.000Z	Ben64	ChipCherou	yep.
2012-02-16T11:43:00.000Z	ChipCherou	Ben64	Thank you, I thought it wouldn't work cause its depreciated.  Ill give it a shot
2012-02-16T11:43:00.000Z	Ben64	ChipCherou	yeah, will still work, its just not needed anymore
2012-02-16T11:44:00.000Z	ChipCherou	Ben64	is there a way to have X automatically use the correct driver instead of hard coding it requiring me to have xorg.conf?
2012-02-16T11:45:00.000Z	Ben64	ChipCherou	it usually does, but if you have both drivers on i guess it can be confused
