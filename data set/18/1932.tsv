2010-10-05T20:39:00.000Z	weeber		hi all :)   I recently installed ubuntu 10.04, and I need help with sound (no sound coming form RhythmBox)
2010-10-05T20:40:00.000Z	maco	weeber	first try installin linux-backports-modules-alsa-lucid-generic
2010-10-05T20:40:00.000Z	maco	weeber	its a package with updated sound drivers for lucid
2010-10-05T20:41:00.000Z	weeber		fyi, i am getting sound from FLV clips and the like
2010-10-05T20:41:00.000Z	maco	weeber	also... double check your mixer settings. make sure PCM and Front and Master are all up
2010-10-05T20:42:00.000Z	weeber	maco	how do I check my 'PCM settings'?
2010-10-05T20:42:00.000Z	weeber		mixer settings, sorry
2010-10-05T20:42:00.000Z	maco	weeber	mixer settings = the volume sliders
2010-10-05T20:43:00.000Z	weeber	maco	there's just one volume slider in the taskbar, and it's ful
2010-10-05T20:43:00.000Z	maco	weeber	there's no "advanced" button?
2010-10-05T20:43:00.000Z	maco	weeber	bahh why do they remove all the useful things from gnome *sigh* ok open a terminal and run "alsamixer"and then check in there. use arrow keys to change volumes and M to mute/unmute (if a "slider" says MM at bottom, it's muted)
2010-10-05T20:43:00.000Z	weeber	maco	i can't see one
2010-10-05T20:44:00.000Z	weeber		ok, i'll do that
2010-10-05T20:47:00.000Z	weeber	maco	i increased all that I could control to 100, but still no sound
2010-10-05T20:47:00.000Z	maco	weeber	ok then install that package and reboot and see if it helps. if not...try the 10.10 RC live cd? and if that doesn't work, please file a bug from that live cd with:    ubuntu-bug -s audio
2010-10-05T20:49:00.000Z	weeber		oh my God :D
2010-10-05T20:49:00.000Z	weeber	maco	very sorry for wasting your time lol.....my headphones were already plugged in xD
2010-10-05T20:49:00.000Z	maco	weeber	haha whoops :P
