2005-09-05T14:09:00.000Z	ubuntu-asker		hi, i do the following... cp my kernel (from a gentoo instalation (on the same host)) to my also working ubuntu instalation, now im "reinstaling" the nvidia module on ubuntu, but wants a lot of depends i say yes to the 12 deps.... will be everything ok?
2005-09-05T14:10:00.000Z	ekimus	ubuntu-asker	no it will not
2005-09-05T14:10:00.000Z	ubuntu-asker	ekimus	ups
2005-09-05T14:11:00.000Z	ekimus	ubuntu-asker	you would have to copy all your modules from gentoo too. but I'd recommend using the default kerne
2005-09-05T14:11:00.000Z	ubuntu-asker	ekimus	yes i do that too
2005-09-05T14:12:00.000Z	ubuntu-asker	ekimus	in fact im using it right now, my doubt is about the deps that ubuntu is downloading (to "rebuild" the nvidia oficial module)
2005-09-05T14:13:00.000Z	ubuntu-asker	ekimus	yes but i have no sound on the default kernel and a LOT of modules, so... i will try this kernel
2005-09-05T14:13:00.000Z	ekimus	ubuntu-asker	that's because on ubuntu (debian-based) distros the way to install kernels is pretty much different from the gentoo way. you can do it by just downloading the source and compile it but the "correct" way would be to compile the kernel create a deb package and install this one
2005-09-05T14:14:00.000Z	ubuntu-asker	ekimus	so your recomendation is... use the default kernel and compile a new one
2005-09-05T14:15:00.000Z	ekimus	ubuntu-asker	yes. you could try to merge the .configs with diff (or just open 2 xterms and go thru the options in menuconfig and add the missing stuff to ubuntu
2005-09-05T14:16:00.000Z	ubuntu-asker	ekimus	ok, i will do that.... thanks
2005-09-05T14:19:00.000Z	ekimus	ubuntu-asker	opera has some quite handy features (and good shortcuts) you either love opera or hate it. that's what I know from a lot of people that tried opera
2005-09-05T14:20:00.000Z	ubuntu-asker	ekimus	about thunderbird and reply to list, you mean that it check the mail headers (list)?
2005-09-05T14:21:00.000Z	ekimus	ubuntu-asker	yes. it can't handle mailing lists which is imho not a missing feature. it is a bug
2005-09-05T14:21:00.000Z	ubuntu-asker	ekimus	Madpilot, IMHO firefox is STILL on 1.x version, its quite "new", but with extensions and popularity, will be better than others
2005-09-05T14:23:00.000Z	ekimus	ubuntu-asker	i'm talking about thunderbird not firefox. and they have to much recommandations for thunderbird for this excuse to be usable
2005-09-05T14:23:00.000Z	ubuntu-asker	ekimus	yes, its a little uncomfortably the way that you must handle list on thunderbird, but isnt SO BAD
2005-09-05T14:25:00.000Z	ekimus	ubuntu-asker	i have to copy and paste the adress for every single mail i answer on a mailing list. that's exactly what you'd had to do if you'd be using outlook express
