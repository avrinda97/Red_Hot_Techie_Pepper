2011-08-31T01:32:00.000Z	whallz		i've tried tcpdump while trying to connecto with the client and i get several like these: 17:12:52.505512 IP xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx.51045 > xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx.51234: UDP, length 160

2011-08-31T01:36:00.000Z	whallz	ActionParsnip	thanks, i did exactly that, and the server is up and running, i need to find why i can't connect with the client
2011-08-31T01:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	whallz	can you telnet to the socket?
2011-08-31T01:37:00.000Z	whallz	ActionParsnip	yeah
2011-08-31T01:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	whallz	that's good, so its not firewall stopping it etc, what OS are the clients?
2011-08-31T01:39:00.000Z	whallz	ActionParsnip	windows 7
2011-08-31T01:39:00.000Z	whallz	ActionParsnip	i can telnet from windows too
2011-08-31T01:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	whallz	was afraid you'd say that, does the client keep a log of what happens when you try to connect?
2011-08-31T01:40:00.000Z	whallz	ActionParsnip	kinda... <18:07:19> Failed to connect to server
2011-08-31T01:40:00.000Z	whallz	ActionParsnip	no description
2011-08-31T01:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	whallz	anything else intelligent or is it dumb like most other windows apps
2011-08-31T01:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	whallz	yeah thought so, I hate windows apps. They give zero feedback
2011-08-31T01:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	whallz	try a linuix client, it may have verbose logging and be actually useful
2011-08-31T01:43:00.000Z	whallz	ActionParsnip	thanks
