2011-12-05T22:35:00.000Z	junglejim	bullgard6	Hmm ... not so happy now after all the backups, downloads and hunting around to make things work. Think I might have to revert to 10.04
2011-12-05T22:37:00.000Z	bullgard6	junglejim	Hold on. What is your present desktop environment?
2011-12-05T22:21:00.000Z	bullgard6	junglejim	To find out, use Disk Utility.
2011-12-05T22:29:00.000Z	junglejim	bullgard6	Thx - Disk seems fine ... It more that I'm finding a general slowness about 11.10 - I have an laptop with 1 Gig mem and an Intel Pentium M  1.6GHz. Is that not enough horse-power for 11.10
2011-12-05T22:31:00.000Z	bullgard6	junglejim	That could be the case. I have heard similar complaints. I myself am using a more powerful laptop and I do not have such slow response.
2011-12-05T22:37:00.000Z	junglejim	bullgard6	I'm using the default - so it must be unity
2011-12-05T22:41:00.000Z	bullgard6	junglejim	I agree. Before reverting back to 10.04 you could install the package gnome-shell and log out. Before you log in,you could select then "GNOME Classic (No effects" in the login menu. Try this and compare its performance with that of Ubuntu 10.04.
2011-12-05T22:42:00.000Z	junglejim	bullgard6	Is gnome-shell like 10.10's gnome?
2011-12-05T22:43:00.000Z	bullgard6	junglejim	No. It is only similar to 10.10'sGNOME.
2011-12-05T22:44:00.000Z	junglejim	bullgard6	hmm thx  ..... let me take a look
2011-12-05T22:55:00.000Z	junglejim	bullgard6	What abot Unity 2D ... do u know anything about it?
2011-12-05T22:55:00.000Z	bullgard6	junglejim	I do not know much about it.
2011-12-05T23:22:00.000Z	junglejim	bullgard6	seems I'm already running Unity 2D - Found this link which shows u how to test: http://www.liberiangeek.net/2011/10/how-to-quickly-find-out-if-ubuntu-is-running-unity-3d/
2011-12-05T23:24:00.000Z	bullgard6	junglejim	So compare this performance with that of your previous Ubuntu 10.04 installation. It should not differ much in my opinion.
2011-12-05T23:25:00.000Z	junglejim	bullgard6	 It's definitely slower :-( but I did find a way to install the old interface now (called ubuntu classic) http://www.liberiangeek.net/2011/08/return-to-ubuntu-classic-desktop-in-ubuntu-11-10/
2011-12-05T23:28:00.000Z	bullgard6	junglejim	I tested ubuntu-classic and liked it. If your Unity 2D is definitely slower then I would conclude that there is an implementation error. I told you that I do not know much about Unity. So I cannot suggest a remedy.
2011-12-05T23:45:00.000Z	junglejim	bullgard6	thx
2011-12-05T23:45:00.000Z	junglejim	bullgard6	for the help
