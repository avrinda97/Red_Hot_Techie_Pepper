2010-05-14T03:48:00.000Z	arand_	subspider	Is it a windows/ubuntu dual-boot?
2010-05-14T03:49:00.000Z	arand_	subspider	Ok, and at the moment when you switch it on nothing happens? or does it do anything?
2010-05-14T03:50:00.000Z	arand_	subspider	So, boot from the liveCD and go into "Try ubuntu"
2010-05-14T03:50:00.000Z	arand_	subspider	It was a normal dual-boot and not a wubi install I take it?
2010-05-14T03:52:00.000Z	arand_	subspider	Installing "inside" windows, i.e. not installing ubuntu when booted from the CD.
2010-05-14T03:53:00.000Z	arand_	subspider	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2#Reinstalling%20from%20LiveCD has a guide on   how to do the reinstall of grub, tell if there are any problems.
2010-05-14T04:01:00.000Z	arand_	subspider	what so?
2010-05-14T04:03:00.000Z	arand_	subspider	hmm...
2010-05-14T04:06:00.000Z	arand_	subspider	Hmm, I don't think I've ever seen that problem...
2010-05-14T04:07:00.000Z	arand_	subspider	If you do "ls -l /usr/lib/grub/i386-pc/915resolution.mod" does it claim the file exists and is well?
2010-05-14T04:10:00.000Z	arand_	subspider	I'm kind of guessing here, but you could try reinstalling the grub tools in your session "sudo aptitude reinstall grub-pc"
2010-05-14T04:12:00.000Z	arand_	subspider	If grub fails to read, it *might* be that the CD is corrupt in a file or many, that's sometihng you might want to check just to make sure...
2010-05-14T04:14:00.000Z	arand_	subspider	That sounds like something is wrong with the CD to me, so re-burning it might be in order. When you boot the liveCD there should be an option to chack the CD and you could do that just to make sure before you burn a new.
2010-05-14T05:07:00.000Z	arand_	subspider	Hmm, I wold guess that it didn't link the grub files correctly, did you mount the ubuntu partition as in the guide?
2010-05-14T05:08:00.000Z	arand_	subspider	Reinstalling grub is most likely not necessary when we know the grub tools were bad an now they should be fine on the new CD
2010-05-14T05:08:00.000Z	arand_	subspider	reinstalling the grub tools I meant
2010-05-14T05:10:00.000Z	arand_	subspider	Yea, kindof, I think the core.img is rebuilt, and of course the mbr needs to be linked to it correctly.
2010-05-14T05:11:00.000Z	arand_	subspider	and the config file needs rewriting... etc.
