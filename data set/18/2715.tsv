2012-07-03T01:37:00.000Z	susana	BluesKaj	I checked for additional controllers and there's a broadcom STA driver
2012-07-03T01:28:00.000Z	BluesKaj	susana	tell us your situation
2012-07-03T01:29:00.000Z	susana	BluesKaj	I'm having trouble with my wifi connection. When I installed Ubuntu it worked, but I rebooted and now it doens't show my wireless networks
2012-07-03T01:29:00.000Z	susana	BluesKaj	also, my new kernel (after upgrade) doesn't boot
2012-07-03T01:30:00.000Z	BluesKaj	susana	have you tried the recovery option on the new kernel , there may be some partial installs which need repair in the recovery kernel.
2012-07-03T01:31:00.000Z	susana	BluesKaj	ok, let me try that
2012-07-03T01:31:00.000Z	susana	BluesKaj	what should I do_
2012-07-03T01:36:00.000Z	susana	BluesKaj	ok now I could boot, but still I have no wifi
2012-07-03T01:37:00.000Z	susana	BluesKaj	it says it is activated and currently being used
2012-07-03T01:38:00.000Z	susana	BluesKaj	I added a new user when the wireless stopped working, does this have anything to do with the problem?
2012-07-03T01:41:00.000Z	susana	BluesKaj	any ideas?
2012-07-03T01:45:00.000Z	BluesKaj	susana	sorry , was away for a few ...which wifi chip ? and have you checked additional drivers for the driver to make sure it's enabled
2012-07-03T01:48:00.000Z	susana	BluesKaj	Broadcom STA it says
2012-07-03T01:48:00.000Z	susana	BluesKaj	03:00.0 Network controller: Broadcom Corporation BCM4313 802.11b/g/n Wireless LAN Controller (rev 01)
2012-07-03T01:50:00.000Z	BluesKaj	susana	open a terminal , sudo modprobe b43 , if there is no output then it's loaded
2012-07-03T01:52:00.000Z	susana	BluesKaj	no output
2012-07-03T01:54:00.000Z	susana	BluesKaj	I'll try bekks web ok?
2012-07-03T01:57:00.000Z	BluesKaj	susana	my wifi knowledge is somewhat limited , but check networm manager to se if you have any networks ,  ifup wlan0, in the terminal might help
