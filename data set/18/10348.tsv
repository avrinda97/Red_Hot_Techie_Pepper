2006-12-23T12:49:00.000Z	n2diy		I have a laptop which currently has FC1 installed on it, and I'd like to install Ubuntu on to it. The system won't boot from the CD drive, and it has no floppy drive, ideas?
2006-12-23T12:50:00.000Z	bulmer	n2diy	can it boot from a usb?
2006-12-23T12:50:00.000Z	n2diy	bulmer	nope
2006-12-23T12:50:00.000Z	n2diy	bulmer	no usb ports
2006-12-23T12:51:00.000Z	bulmer	n2diy	it wont boot because it never had or it does not have a cdrom?
2006-12-23T12:52:00.000Z	bulmer	n2diy	you can attempt a network install..assuming your nic card can handle boot over pxe
2006-12-23T12:54:00.000Z	n2diy	bulmer	I can't get the network card working. :/
2006-12-23T12:54:00.000Z	bulmer	n2diy	it seems about time for a newer laptop..
2006-12-23T12:56:00.000Z	n2diy	bulmer	I'm looking for a cheap fix
2007-01-10T09:28:00.000Z	bulmer	n2diy	then make sure your box forwards
2007-01-10T09:29:00.000Z	bulmer	n2diy	then make sure your box forwards  .. cat 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
2007-01-10T09:32:00.000Z	n2diy	bulmer	I get permission denied running that command, even with sudo?
2007-01-10T09:33:00.000Z	bulmer	n2diy	as root, check if that /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward is set to one, you can cat it
2007-01-10T09:34:00.000Z	n2diy	bulmer	I removed the > 1, and it ran, and returned a 1
2007-01-10T09:35:00.000Z	bulmer	n2diy	then next make sure the NATing is working so it can translate the ip address between internal and external
2007-01-10T09:35:00.000Z	n2diy	bulmer	roger.
2007-01-10T09:37:00.000Z	bulmer	n2diy	thats probably a firewall rule
2007-01-10T09:37:00.000Z	n2diy	bulmer	roger. :)
