2010-03-09T18:40:00.000Z	ubuntudualboot		every time I try to install GRUB bootloader (on the alt install CD) it says "UNABLE TO INSTALL GRUB IN (ha0,#). EXECUTING 'grub-install (ha0,#) FAILED. THIS IS A FATAL ERROR. Where # is the sda number of the boot partition.
2010-03-09T18:41:00.000Z	ubuntudualboot		what did I do wrong?

2010-03-09T18:43:00.000Z	llutz	ubuntudualboot	grub starts partition-counting at 0. so /dev/sda1 = (hd0,0)
2010-03-09T18:44:00.000Z	ubuntudualboot	llutz	I've tried that also
2010-03-09T18:44:00.000Z	ubuntudualboot	llutz	how do you spell your nick?
2010-03-09T18:45:00.000Z	llutz	ubuntudualboot	llutz
2010-03-09T18:45:00.000Z	ubuntudualboot	llutz	obviously I cant read that so could you capitalise or lower case as needed so I can read it
2010-03-09T18:46:00.000Z	llutz	ubuntudualboot	LL
2010-03-09T18:46:00.000Z	ubuntudualboot	llutz	your nick doesnt auto complete
2010-03-09T18:46:00.000Z	llutz	ubuntudualboot	hint: use a more readable font
2010-03-09T18:47:00.000Z	ubuntudualboot	llutz	im using a live cd
2010-03-09T18:48:00.000Z	llutz	ubuntudualboot	use /dev/sdXY notation
2010-03-09T18:48:00.000Z	ubuntudualboot	llutz	I've tried that too.
2010-03-09T18:48:00.000Z	llutz	ubuntudualboot	"... (ha#). Where # is the sda number of the boot partition." <- that's nonsense
2010-03-09T18:49:00.000Z	ubuntudualboot	llutz	why are you making suggestions if you couldnt understand my question?
2010-03-09T18:49:00.000Z	llutz	ubuntudualboot	there is no "(ha)" in grub, it's (hdx,y) and grub counts different from /dev/sdXY
