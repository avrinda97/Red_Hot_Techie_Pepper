2007-11-25T10:25:00.000Z	MasterShrek	Kalamansi	without a gui youd have to use sudo vi or sudo nano

2007-12-18T11:05:00.000Z	MasterShrek	Kalamansi	ftp://user:pass@server:port

2007-12-18T11:07:00.000Z	MasterShrek	Kalamansi	nautilus will allow read/write (if you have permissions)
2007-12-18T11:08:00.000Z	MasterShrek	Kalamansi	nautilus, your default file browser

2007-12-18T11:20:00.000Z	MasterShrek	Kalamansi	im not exactly sure, i woudl check in /var/cache/apt or wherever the packages are stored, and just copy them over and install/upgrade them, youll have to ask an ubuntu user the exact directory where those cached packages are
