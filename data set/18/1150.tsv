2011-06-10T09:11:00.000Z	Shikhin		Some body help! I installed Ubuntu 11.04 using Wubi, and everything was working fine. Till now, that is. Recently, I have started getting the errors: http://paste.ubuntu.com/623090/ I tried chkdsk /r but it didn't help. Ubuntu is installed in G: drive by the way.
2011-06-10T09:11:00.000Z	Shikhin		I am badly in need of help.
2011-06-10T09:11:00.000Z	Shikhin		I have large amounts of data in my Windows installation.
2011-06-10T09:12:00.000Z	Shikhin		And uh, I can't find the files in G:\ drive also!
2011-06-10T09:12:00.000Z	Shikhin		Moreover, I cannot find any "found.000" folder.
2011-06-10T09:14:00.000Z	Shikhin		Anyone? I am frustrated!
2011-06-10T09:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Shikhin	ask in ##windows for windows help
2011-06-10T09:17:00.000Z	Shikhin	ActionParsnip	This isn't Windows help. I installed Ubuntu through Wubi. Now I don't think Windows are going to help me. Some one of you are.
2011-06-10T09:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Shikhin	those are windows files on a windows partition
2011-06-10T09:18:00.000Z	Shikhin	ActionParsnip	But are for Ubuntu.
2011-06-10T09:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Shikhin	no, they are made by windows
2011-06-10T09:18:00.000Z	Shikhin	ActionParsnip	You know what Wubi is?
2011-06-10T09:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Shikhin	yes, but i don't like it
2011-06-10T09:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Shikhin	those files are nothing to do with wubi
2011-06-10T09:19:00.000Z	Shikhin	ActionParsnip	Huh?
2011-06-10T09:19:00.000Z	Shikhin	ActionParsnip	"/ubuntu/disk/root.disk" has nothing to do with Ubuntu?
2011-06-10T09:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Shikhin	you are clearly an idiot so I'll give you a link: http://www.pcreview.co.uk/forums/safe-delete-found-000-found-001-found-002-newbie-t1503051.html   IT IS A WINDOWS ISSUE
