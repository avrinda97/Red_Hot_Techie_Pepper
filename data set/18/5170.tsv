2010-05-30T08:09:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	doug__	video card problem? do you know what video card your system has?
2010-05-30T08:10:00.000Z	doug__	onetinsoldier	it has intel video
2010-05-30T08:10:00.000Z	doug__	onetinsoldier	it's a toughbook cf-29
2010-05-30T08:11:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	doug__	yeah.. 10.04 has some issues with some Intel Integrated gvideo card models. there are some workarounds, list here --> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LucidLynx/ReleaseNotes#Intel%208xx%20X%20freezes/crashes
2010-06-03T08:37:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	doug__	you need to install the kernel-headers
2010-06-03T08:38:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	doug__	just to let you know, the package you probably want is.. linux-headers-generic   ..if you're using the generic kernel
2010-06-03T08:38:00.000Z	doug__	onetinsoldier	ok I just checked synaptics, and linux-headers-2.6.32-21-generic is installed
2010-06-03T08:39:00.000Z	doug__	onetinsoldier	should I install the 2.6.32-22-generic version as well?
2010-06-03T08:39:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	doug__	what do you get from --> uname -r  ?
2010-06-03T08:39:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	doug__	yes
2010-06-03T08:39:00.000Z	doug__	onetinsoldier	I get -22 maybe my kernel updated in one of the apt upgrades lol
2010-06-03T08:40:00.000Z	doug__	onetinsoldier	everything makes sense now
2010-06-03T08:40:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	doug__	if your just using kernel 2.6.32-22 then you could just purge the old -21 revision as long as your booted into the -22 version
2010-06-03T08:41:00.000Z	doug__	onetinsoldier	any idea on this? http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1500176
2010-06-03T08:43:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	doug__	i don't know anything about wireless, sorry. you use a laptop/netbook? i'm just simple desktop guy here, and i don't even have any bluetooth components or anything
2010-06-03T08:44:00.000Z	doug__	onetinsoldier	yea I was mostly wondering about the other package that they said to download. There isn't one that's named the same for Lucid
2010-06-03T08:44:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	doug__	maybe wicd? i don't know
2010-06-03T08:47:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	doug__	yeah, bot wasn't helpful there. i usually just use apt-cache search in terminal
