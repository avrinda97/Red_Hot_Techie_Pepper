2007-01-15T14:44:00.000Z	mrfunyon		anyone know how to get ac97 codec's working? I have tried to search for it with no luck :(
2007-01-15T14:45:00.000Z	mrfunyon		yes
2007-01-15T14:45:00.000Z	mrfunyon		yes, I have no sound
2007-01-15T14:46:00.000Z	mrfunyon		I just installed ubuntu yesterday and everything but the sound works just fine :(
2007-01-15T14:47:00.000Z	Math^	mrfunyon	strange... I've got only problems playing some old games
2007-01-15T14:48:00.000Z	mrfunyon		it's a headless machine that basicly I am using as a file server, so I am not certain if it's just the way that it was installed or whatnot.
2007-01-15T14:48:00.000Z	Math^	mrfunyon	wich installer you have used?
2007-01-15T14:49:00.000Z	mrfunyon	Math^	the first one (I think it was dekstop), then I installed all the stuff I needed it to be a file server
2007-01-15T14:49:00.000Z	mrfunyon		it's the Dapper Drake release
2007-01-15T14:50:00.000Z	Math^	mrfunyon	I use the alternate CD
2007-01-15T14:50:00.000Z	mrfunyon	Math^	So you would suggest re-installing the machine?
2007-01-15T14:51:00.000Z	Math^	mrfunyon	well, no... not nesecary I gues... but I use the alternateCD and have no problems, you've installed the server-installer?
2007-01-15T14:52:00.000Z	mrfunyon		no, the desktop, then installed all the server stuff (Was going to install the server but pressed the wrong button and just stuck with it)
2007-01-15T14:53:00.000Z	Math^	mrfunyon	I mean... I've installed the server-installer ones, then I installed ubuntu-desktop... I thought everything works/looks fine... but there were also no sound
2007-01-15T14:54:00.000Z	mrfunyon	Math^	hrm.... could try re-installing the machine, wouldn't take long, do you think it would fix my problem?
2007-01-15T14:55:00.000Z	Math^	mrfunyon	maybe you should ask someone else, most time when I'm here, I've got also problems/questions...
2007-01-15T14:55:00.000Z	mrfunyon	Math^	okey dokey :)
2007-01-15T14:55:00.000Z	Math^	mrfunyon	hope you will figured it out :)
