2007-11-29T06:41:00.000Z	Silmeria		anyways, with my problem, now that its -R
2007-11-29T06:42:00.000Z	Silmeria		its not resolution, my display is not using my entire moniter
2007-11-29T06:42:00.000Z	jrib	Silmeria	laptop?
2007-11-29T06:42:00.000Z	Silmeria	jrib	yes
2007-11-29T06:42:00.000Z	Silmeria	jrib	7.10 was full monitor properly
2007-11-29T06:44:00.000Z	jrib	Silmeria	it is probably a resolution issue though.  Your laptop probably has the ability to stretch the display or keep black borders around a smaller resolution (and you can toggle this behavior with some button).  What is your LCDs native resolution and what is your current resolution?
2007-11-29T06:45:00.000Z	Silmeria	jrib	im not sure is there any way to see?
2007-11-29T06:45:00.000Z	Silmeria	jrib	besides a ruler >>
2007-11-29T06:45:00.000Z	jrib	Silmeria	which part?  the native resolution or the current one?
2007-11-29T06:45:00.000Z	Silmeria	jrib	._. both
2007-11-29T06:46:00.000Z	jrib	Silmeria	k, so now in ubuntu, see what the current res is (system -> administration -> screens and graphics)
2007-11-29T06:47:00.000Z	Silmeria	jrib	im sorry i didnt see the link last time you said that, thanks
2007-11-29T06:48:00.000Z	Silmeria	jrib	ack... im sorry to bother so much but i dont really understand what its saying. ubuntu worked on my other laptop fine, but i had to edit the install of this one because i use SATA harddrive
2007-11-29T06:49:00.000Z	jrib	Silmeria	it gives you steps so that you can have more options for the screen resolution
2007-11-29T07:23:00.000Z	Silmeria	jrib	i type sudo apt-get install xresprobe and it says its refered to by a different  name.  i need this package to see my moniter refresh reate and stuff, how do i get it :(
2007-11-29T07:24:00.000Z	jrib	Silmeria	what version of ubunut?
2007-11-29T07:25:00.000Z	jrib	Silmeria	pastebin your /etc/apt/sources.list
2007-11-29T07:28:00.000Z	jrib	Silmeria	now pastebin the output of: sudo aptitude update && sudo aptitude install xresprobe
