2009-09-04T12:21:00.000Z	jMCg		So, I wanted to ask: I am about to run off and getmyself a nettop, with 2 intel atom 330 processors. These support 64 bitses. However, there's nowhere an USB IMG for x64 to be found -- can I make that myself, by unpacking an .ISO?
2009-09-04T12:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jMCg	you can use software to put iso correctly onto a usb

2010-05-30T00:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jMCg	are you using desktop effects?
2010-05-30T00:45:00.000Z	jMCg	ActionParsnip	I'm not entirely sure -- this is my first time to use Gnome in a couple of years. I do have a transparent konsole, or terminal. I need that. Yes.
2010-05-30T00:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jMCg	if you press alt+f2 and type:  metacity --replace     is it ok?
2010-05-30T00:45:00.000Z	jMCg	ActionParsnip	that would requrie being able to type... I can do via SSH, I suppose.
2010-05-30T00:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jMCg	not sure there dude
2010-05-30T00:47:00.000Z	jMCg	ActionParsnip	yup.. that worked, as in: I was able to type. But it didn't really help with anything...
2010-05-30T00:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jMCg	then its an issue with compiz, i'd ask in #compiz
2010-05-30T00:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jMCg	i've seen this before but am unsure of the fix
2010-05-30T00:47:00.000Z	jMCg	ActionParsnip	I don't use compiz. I suppose. Let me check.
2010-05-30T00:48:00.000Z	jMCg	ActionParsnip	nope. No compiz. Effects come from metacity. But the effects are not the issue. It's the input tdevices.
2010-05-30T00:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jMCg	the WM interprets the clicks afaik
2010-05-30T00:48:00.000Z	jMCg	ActionParsnip	not if X doesn't translate them to begin with.
2011-09-15T21:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	jMCg	  #ubuntu+1  for anything oneiric til release
