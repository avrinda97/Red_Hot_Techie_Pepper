2007-12-19T22:21:00.000Z	JonathanD		acceptable, even
2007-12-19T22:21:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	JonathanD	We are probably thinking the same thing
2007-12-19T22:22:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	JonathanD	not when there is a much easier solution
2008-03-13T18:47:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	JonathanD	Verify that VertRefresh and Horizsync are set to your monitors' specifications in the /etc/X11/xorg.conf Under Section Monitor
2008-03-13T18:48:00.000Z	JonathanD	Jack_Sparrow	I used the settings for my monitor model out of the gui tool.
2008-03-13T18:48:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	JonathanD	Did you verify them... against your monitors specs?
2008-03-13T18:49:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	JonathanD	sudo apt-get install pastebinit  && cat /etc/X11/xorg.conf | pastebinit
2008-03-13T18:51:00.000Z	JonathanD	Jack_Sparrow	if that util does what it sounds like, cool :)
2008-03-13T18:51:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	JonathanD	It only returns a link to a pastebin of your xorg..
2008-03-13T18:52:00.000Z	JonathanD	Jack_Sparrow	and pastebins it, I assume.
2008-03-13T18:53:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	JonathanD	please provide the link to the xorg

2008-03-13T19:01:00.000Z	JonathanD	Jack_Sparrow	DELL E770s
2008-03-13T19:06:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	JonathanD	Monitor setup looks fine...  still reading
2008-03-13T19:07:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	JonathanD	HAve you tried dropping the depth to 16
2008-03-13T19:44:00.000Z	JonathanD	Jack_Sparrow	I have not, I'll try that.
