2009-08-11T14:42:00.000Z	jacekowski		i'm copying my harddisk to new one
2009-08-11T14:43:00.000Z	jacekowski		resizing and doing lot of stuff with it
2009-08-11T14:43:00.000Z	jacekowski		not really
2009-08-11T14:43:00.000Z	jacekowski		from live system
2009-08-11T14:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	jacekowski	make sure the data backup is recent on the partition(s) you are resizing
2009-08-11T14:43:00.000Z	jacekowski	ActionParsnip1	it's reiserfs
2009-08-11T14:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	jacekowski	doesnt matter, backups are still great for if something goes wrong
2009-08-11T14:51:00.000Z	jacekowski	ActionParsnip1	resize on reiser is safe operation - it's builtin into kernel, it's journaled, there is no way that resize can go wrong - it's as safe as any other operation
2009-08-11T14:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	jacekowski	what if you hav a power outage during the operation
2009-08-11T14:51:00.000Z	jacekowski	ActionParsnip1	journal
2009-08-11T14:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	jacekowski	or a surge
2009-08-11T14:51:00.000Z	jacekowski	ActionParsnip1	resize on reiser is journaled
2009-08-11T14:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	jacekowski	ive just seen too many people in here moaning their data is lost when they start doing stuff like that or when their drive dies and they havent got a backup but their data is "important"
2009-08-11T14:52:00.000Z	jacekowski	ActionParsnip1	besides i have UPSes
2009-08-11T14:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	jacekowski	its an eample
2009-08-11T14:52:00.000Z	jacekowski	ActionParsnip1	and diesel generator that will start 10 seconds later
2009-08-11T14:54:00.000Z	jacekowski	ActionParsnip1	and one more thing - i moving and resizing partitions on new disk, and old one is completly untouched
2009-08-11T14:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	jacekowski	its just a friendly warning RE what i said earlier
