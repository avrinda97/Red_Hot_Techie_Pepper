2011-09-16T19:50:00.000Z	dr_willis	auronandace	 for my nvidia chipsets i just enable it via nvidia-settings..
2011-09-16T20:02:00.000Z	auronandace	dr_willis	thanks mate, all fine and fully functional now
2011-09-26T21:35:00.000Z	auronandace	dr_willis	sorry, my mistake regarding the 686
2011-10-13T16:28:00.000Z	auronandace	dr_willis	i think ubuntu classic mode should have come with a nice big warning notification
2011-10-25T19:14:00.000Z	auronandace	dr_willis	likewise, especially when they think it is secure and "for hackers"
2011-10-27T13:48:00.000Z	auronandace	dr_willis	oh
2011-10-27T13:49:00.000Z	auronandace	dr_willis	nor can i :)
2012-01-12T03:29:00.000Z	auronandace	dr_willis	maybe they have different compilation options?
2012-01-29T13:15:00.000Z	auronandace	dr_willis	very true
2012-02-04T18:02:00.000Z	dr_willis	auronandace	 you like that red joy-mouse thing they have? :) i never could get the feel for them
2012-02-04T18:03:00.000Z	auronandace	dr_willis	i've always used a usb mouse with them (essentially use thinkpads as desktop replacements)
2012-02-04T18:03:00.000Z	dr_willis	auronandace	 my last laptop weighed more then many desktops. :)
2012-02-07T14:37:00.000Z	auronandace	dr_willis	not mutter?
2012-03-23T21:47:00.000Z	dr_willis	auronandace	 :)  i was wondering about that also...
2012-05-25T14:18:00.000Z	auronandace	dr_willis	i don't think it does
2012-05-25T14:18:00.000Z	dr_willis	auronandace	 but im not a laywer.. but i bet the people in #GPL may know
2012-11-15T16:53:00.000Z	auronandace	dr_willis	no, he means alternative ways of downloading releases (torrents etc)
