2008-08-22T14:55:00.000Z	SUSaiyan		okay apparently smb.conf is part of samba-common
2008-08-22T14:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	SUSaiyan	theres a stock on in /etc/samba
2008-08-22T14:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	SUSaiyan	but it needs modifying to your needs
2008-08-22T14:56:00.000Z	SUSaiyan	ActionParsnip	naturally, but i just needed the default back
2008-08-22T14:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	SUSaiyan	i see
2008-08-22T14:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	SUSaiyan	make a backup before modifying .conf files
2008-08-22T14:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	SUSaiyan	then you can roll back
2008-08-22T14:57:00.000Z	SUSaiyan	ActionParsnip	i did, but then i made a mistake and overwrote it :)
2008-08-22T14:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	SUSaiyan	no, i mean crate a backup (e.g sudo cp /etc/samba/smb.conf /etc/samba/smb.conf.old
2008-08-22T14:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	SUSaiyan	oh did you copy the wrong way to roll back?
2008-08-22T14:59:00.000Z	SUSaiyan	ActionParsnip	thats exactly what i did, but then i did it again after changing it
2008-08-22T14:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	SUSaiyan	you can always create version numbers in yuor fileneames :D. Glad its ok now :D
2008-08-22T15:00:00.000Z	SUSaiyan	ActionParsnip	the thing is that the original file is usually smb.conf.example on gentoo
2008-08-22T15:01:00.000Z	SUSaiyan	ActionParsnip	so i didnt think that .old would be used, but i used it as backup a couple of weeks back
2008-08-22T15:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	SUSaiyan	its not really as it doesnt match the filename expected by samba
2008-08-22T15:02:00.000Z	SUSaiyan	ActionParsnip	true but gentoo by default doesnt have a smb.conf i believe
2008-08-22T15:03:00.000Z	SUSaiyan	ActionParsnip	they make you copy the example
2008-08-22T15:03:00.000Z	SUSaiyan	ActionParsnip	anyway, back to work for me, thanks :)
