2006-10-20T09:13:00.000Z	chx		hi. if I have /boot on one disk and / on another , can I umount & remove /boot after booting?
2006-10-20T09:14:00.000Z	ra21vi	chx	try it, but when kernel is loaded, u dont need /boot anymore
2006-10-20T09:14:00.000Z	ra21vi	chx	but why do u want to do that
2006-10-20T09:14:00.000Z	chx	ra21vi	because I have a complex installation scheme...
2006-10-20T09:15:00.000Z	ra21vi	chx	u can go some safe way
2006-10-20T09:15:00.000Z	ra21vi	chx	do u want to change the /boot to another partiotion
2006-10-20T09:15:00.000Z	chx	ra21vi	look, I will have a laptop which has a CF card reader (recognized as a PCMCIA device) and I would like to run my Dapper from a CF card and switch the HDD off to conserve battery
2006-10-20T09:15:00.000Z	chx	ra21vi	but, the CF is not a bootable device
2006-10-20T09:16:00.000Z	chx	ra21vi	so /boot goes on /dev/hda , / goes on /dev/hdc and then I want to be able to hdparm -Y /dev/hda once the booting is done.
2006-10-20T09:16:00.000Z	ra21vi	chx	hey, maybe u search google.. n u will find some guide on CF booting LInux Howtos
2006-10-20T09:17:00.000Z	chx	ra21vi	not when it's a PCMCIA device
2006-10-20T09:18:00.000Z	chx	ra21vi	and the BIOS won't boot from PCMCIA
2006-10-20T09:18:00.000Z	ra21vi	chx	ok, i dont want to waste ur time.. i want to say, i dont know much in CF fields :)
2006-10-20T09:18:00.000Z	ra21vi	chx	so find some1 lese buddy... sorry
2006-10-20T09:18:00.000Z	chx	ra21vi	those tutorials are for the case when you plug your cf in an ata converter
2006-10-20T09:19:00.000Z	ra21vi	chx	:) .. ya, cuz i really dont want sm 1 to misguide for nothing ..
2006-10-20T09:19:00.000Z	chx	ra21vi	now, cf booting linux pcmcia does not come up empty handed :)
2006-10-20T09:20:00.000Z	ra21vi	chx	oh.. try it :) good luck buddy ....
