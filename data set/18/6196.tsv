2008-06-10T15:04:00.000Z	PetoKraus		hello, i am gentoo user, helping out a guy with ubuntu - is there a way how to compile a kernel? i mean, specific?
2008-06-10T15:04:00.000Z	PetoKraus		for ubuntu? cause gentoo does it differently... thanks
2008-06-10T15:05:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	PetoKraus	Make sure build-essential has been installed, then google "Compile Ubuntu Kernel" and it should pop you up ..
2008-06-10T15:05:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	PetoKraus	How is Gentoo doing? I used it exclusively until I got lazy .. :) .. I miss it though ..
2008-06-10T15:05:00.000Z	PetoKraus	NineTeen67Comet	i know how to compile kernel, but, i usually do it without initramd (gentoo way).
2008-06-10T15:06:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	PetoKraus	With Ubuntu out of the box it's lacking the tools needed to compile. sudo aptitude install build-essential (might have misspelled it) .. contains the items needed to compile.
2008-06-10T15:07:00.000Z	PetoKraus	NineTeen67Comet	i was debian user, never used ubuntu, but i got dissatisfied with constant overwriting of your confs - like, /boot/grub/menu.lst
2008-06-10T15:07:00.000Z	PetoKraus	NineTeen67Comet	already apt-got.
2008-06-10T15:07:00.000Z	PetoKraus	NineTeen67Comet	gentoo at least warns you when it overwrites your configs :)
2008-06-10T15:09:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	PetoKraus	what was it in Gentoo .. um .. etc-config or something? I miss it, it was nice, but my server's got really hard to keep up .. I'm no good at compiling kernels in Ubuntu, but you should be able to find it via Google or the Ubuntuforums.org site ..
2008-06-10T15:09:00.000Z	PetoKraus	NineTeen67Comet	etc-update, yeah :) i found the command, it's make-kpkg...
2008-06-10T15:09:00.000Z	PetoKraus	NineTeen67Comet	it's actually the same as debian way. Though init ramdisks suck, it's useless hassle, in my opinion...
2008-06-10T15:11:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	PetoKraus	I'll have to try to compile a Kernel in *buntu some day .. I'm hoping after classes this semester I can install Gentoo on one of my many boxes and get back to my roots ..
2008-06-10T15:11:00.000Z	PetoKraus	NineTeen67Comet	well, i had custom kernel in debian, along with custom scripts - then apt-get dist-upgrade smashed it all
2008-06-10T15:14:00.000Z	PetoKraus	NineTeen67Comet	what you don't like about apt-get?!?
2008-06-10T15:14:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	PetoKraus	apt-get seems to mess stuff up for me more than aptitude ..
2008-06-10T15:14:00.000Z	PetoKraus	NineTeen67Comet	that's weird. because aptitude USES apt-get.
2008-06-10T15:15:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	PetoKraus	especially when removing things I installed with aptitude .. aptitude seems to keep an eye on dependancies better when it is used for installation .. emerge however is still my fave ..lol
