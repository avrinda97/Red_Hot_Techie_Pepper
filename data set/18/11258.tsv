2007-09-26T10:13:00.000Z	calc	mssever	it uses a perfectly sane version scheme year.month
2007-09-26T10:13:00.000Z	calc	mssever	7.10 is 2007 October
2007-09-26T10:13:00.000Z	mssever	calc	True, but it's unusual
2007-09-26T10:13:00.000Z	calc		its more sane than most versioning schemes out there
2007-09-26T10:13:00.000Z	mssever	calc	noodles12 That was my point
2007-09-26T10:14:00.000Z	calc		especially the sun and microsoft ones ;)
2007-09-26T10:14:00.000Z	calc		eg windows vista is window 6.0 (iirc)
2007-09-26T10:14:00.000Z	calc		er windows 6.0
2007-09-26T10:14:00.000Z	mssever	calc	But it isn't major.minor.patch like most OSS
2007-09-26T10:14:00.000Z	calc		solaris 10 is solaris 2.10 is sunos 5.10 (iirc)
2007-09-26T10:15:00.000Z	calc	mssever	which OSS dists use that versioning scheme?
2007-09-26T10:15:00.000Z	calc	mssever	only the bsd's spring to mind
2007-09-26T10:15:00.000Z	mssever	calc	I don't know about distros, I meant software in general
2007-09-26T10:15:00.000Z	mssever		such as the kernel
2007-09-26T10:15:00.000Z	calc	mssever	also versioning major.minor.patch is largely abritrary outside of libraries
2007-09-26T10:16:00.000Z	calc	mssever	libraries that are done right use that versioning scheme properly :)
2007-09-26T10:17:00.000Z	calc	mssever	slackware sorta used that numbering scheme but felt they were being left behind in version number so jumped it from iirc 4.x->7.x or something like that several years ago
2007-09-26T10:17:00.000Z	mssever	calc	It's true that a lot of versioning is determined by marketing
