2010-12-20T21:58:00.000Z	bonjoyee	dnivra	Some_Person does not have a separate /home!
2010-12-20T21:59:00.000Z	dnivra	bonjoyee	but even if you do not format, it won't replace the files in /home right? only /usr, /boot etc would be. correct?
2010-12-20T22:01:00.000Z	bonjoyee	dnivra	technically yes..but in practice..never tried!
2010-12-20T22:03:00.000Z	bonjoyee	dnivra	also if its a different version of ubuntu..not formatting the / (and hence /home) will leave some garbage from the older version..libs..bin etc.. what say?
2010-12-20T22:04:00.000Z	dnivra	bonjoyee	no the bin, lib, etc will be replaced by the newer ones i think.
2010-12-20T22:05:00.000Z	bonjoyee	dnivra	thats fine for those that have the exact names/versions..but what about the older ones?
2010-12-20T22:05:00.000Z	dnivra	bonjoyee	i've never really checked :).
2010-12-20T22:06:00.000Z	dnivra	bonjoyee	know any libraries in 10.04 not there in 10.10? i didn't format my partition.
2010-12-20T22:08:00.000Z	bonjoyee	dnivra	its not just about them being present or not...if libx.so.5.1 is in 10.04...in 10.10 the version may be libx.so.6.1...so if u don't format / ..both will be there..which doesn't seems right!
2010-12-20T22:09:00.000Z	dnivra	bonjoyee	yeah true it makes sense. i guess it would co-exist.
2010-12-20T22:09:00.000Z	bonjoyee	dnivra	and hence lead to conflicts?
2010-12-20T22:10:00.000Z	dnivra	bonjoyee	i'm not sure of conflicts cos applications would use one version of library and load only that right?
2010-12-20T22:11:00.000Z	bonjoyee	dnivra	only ones that are build statically..but those that are dynamic may cause errors..check ldconfig, ldd commands!
2010-12-20T22:12:00.000Z	dnivra	bonjoyee	oh yeah dynamic loading may cause problems. true. guess it's best to back up then :). you were right.
2010-12-20T22:12:00.000Z	dnivra	bonjoyee	okay i think i meant dynamic linking.
2010-12-20T22:13:00.000Z	bonjoyee	dnivra	not trying to argue or something or being smart..just a constructive debate i guess:)
2010-12-20T22:13:00.000Z	dnivra	bonjoyee	oh no no no. it's okay. it's something i didn't think of-and didn't have problems till now so assumed it's all okay :).
2010-12-20T22:14:00.000Z	dnivra	bonjoyee	except that i can't hibernate :)
