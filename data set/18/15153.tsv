2005-04-28T13:59:00.000Z	jazon		hi - I am getting a strange error - I thought I had it figured out, but then I got this.  My problem is that I have no TV-output - it is scrambled.  I know now that it is because it set to PAL, but I can't change it.  I go to ATI control in KDE and I get the following error:
2005-04-28T14:00:00.000Z	jazon		Fire GL Control.  Driver does not provide the FireGL X11 extensions! Panel components will operate only partially.

2005-04-28T14:01:00.000Z	cwarner	jazon	you need to find the appropriate documentation from ati on how their binary driver works and what the appropriate config options would be for x11

2005-04-28T14:11:00.000Z	cwarner	jazon	ati video cards aren't cutting edge at least not in the context of linux
2005-04-28T14:12:00.000Z	jazon	cwarner	the pci-e technology is new.
2005-04-28T14:12:00.000Z	cwarner	jazon	not for linux
2005-04-28T14:13:00.000Z	cwarner	jazon	there is probably nothing in that machine linux can't currently handle.. not even your video card
2005-04-28T14:14:00.000Z	cwarner	jazon	nope nope and nope
2005-04-28T14:16:00.000Z	cwarner	jazon	well thats not good.. one could reverse engineer that stuff but its 2005.. why waste the time
