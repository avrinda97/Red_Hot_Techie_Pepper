2011-01-24T20:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AbuBadr	add:   acpi=off   in the quotes in /etc/default/grub    you will need to run:  sudo update-grub    to apply the setting
2011-01-24T20:46:00.000Z	AbuBadr	ActionParsnip	thank you
2011-01-24T20:52:00.000Z	AbuBadr	ActionParsnip	i opened grub but where to put acpi=off in that file? it will not affect system boot?
2011-01-24T20:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AbuBadr	yes, it will make acpi not be loaded
2011-01-24T20:54:00.000Z	AbuBadr	ActionParsnip	but the grub is full of data. where to put acpi=off exactly?
2011-01-24T20:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AbuBadr	GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash"   change it to    GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash acpi=off"
2011-01-24T20:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AbuBadr	eithe
2011-01-24T20:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AbuBadr	the file is outside home, you need to run:  gksudo gedit /etc/default/grub   to get write access
2011-01-24T20:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AbuBadr	ANY file outside of your home that you need write access to, use sudo or gksudo (gksudo if you intend to use graphical apps to edit / manipulate the data)
