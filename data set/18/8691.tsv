2007-09-28T15:13:00.000Z	oxeimon		hey
2007-09-28T15:13:00.000Z	oxeimon		why can my windows machine read my jpeg pictures but not my ubuntu machine?
2007-09-28T15:14:00.000Z	oxeimon		I had them on a flash drive
2007-09-28T15:14:00.000Z	oxeimon		"Couldn't load image 'CAVE.JPG'...Error interpreting JPEG image file (Unsupported marker type 0xaa)"
2007-09-28T15:15:00.000Z	oxeimon		how do I do that?
2007-09-28T15:16:00.000Z	Jordan_U	oxeimon	Put it on flicker or something.
2007-09-28T15:13:00.000Z	Jordan_U	oxeimon	Ubuntu can read jpeg just fine
2007-09-28T15:14:00.000Z	Jordan_U	oxeimon	What happens when you try to open them?
2007-09-28T15:15:00.000Z	Jordan_U	oxeimon	Do you mind posting a link to one so I can see if it opens on my computer?
2007-10-20T08:38:00.000Z	Jordan_U	oxeimon	Look in /etc/X11/ and see if there is a backup of your old xorg.conf
2007-10-20T08:38:00.000Z	oxeimon	Jordan_U	What will it look like?
2007-10-20T08:39:00.000Z	Jordan_U	oxeimon	It will start with "xorg.conf" and probably end in a date
2007-10-20T08:40:00.000Z	oxeimon	Jordan_U	When I start up ubuntu, everything looks compeltely messed up...I can't even see anything clearly
2007-10-20T08:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	oxeimon	Try starting in recovery mode or try pressing ctrl+alt+F1 to get to a terminal
2007-10-20T08:41:00.000Z	oxeimon	Jordan_U	So I have xorg.conf, xorg.conf~, xorg.conf.1, xorg.conf.2...etc
2007-10-20T08:42:00.000Z	oxeimon	Jordan_U	Which xorg do I want?
2007-10-20T08:42:00.000Z	Jordan_U	oxeimon	I don't know
2007-10-20T08:44:00.000Z	Jordan_U	oxeimon	Try any of them, since you havn't had any problems before they are likely all good, or just delete your current one and let X figure itself out on its own :)
