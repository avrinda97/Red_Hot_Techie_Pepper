2010-09-11T07:58:00.000Z	MACscr		hmm, my swap doesnt seem to be "mounting" on boot. Where should i start looking?
2010-09-11T07:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	MACscr	 /etc/fstab for typos
2010-09-11T07:59:00.000Z	MACscr	Dr_Willis	just says: # swap was on /dev/sda5 during installation
2010-09-11T07:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	MACscr	 now try 'sudo fdisk -l'  and blkid command to be sure the uuid's are correct
2010-09-11T08:01:00.000Z	MACscr	Dr_Willis	the disk identifier's listed there are much much shorter than that UID
2010-09-11T08:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	MACscr	 have you resized the disks recently? that can change the uuid's
2010-09-11T08:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	MACscr	 you could edit the fstab to use the /dev/sdXX type name also.
2010-09-11T08:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	MACscr	 or correct teh UUID
2010-09-11T08:04:00.000Z	MACscr	Dr_Willis	anyway for me to activate it without rebooting? I found something like swapon -a, but that gave me the following error: ubuntu:/$ sudo swapon -a
2010-09-11T08:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	MACscr	 sda5 is your swap partition? could be it got messed up
2010-09-11T08:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	MACscr	 swapon is ran at boot time.. so the result is the same.. thats proberly why its failing in the first place
2010-09-11T08:04:00.000Z	MACscr	Dr_Willis	yes. So now do i unmess it up? =P
2010-09-11T08:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	MACscr	 reforamt the swap partition  with mkswap /dev/sda5 (IF sda5 is the swap)
2010-09-11T08:08:00.000Z	MACscr	Dr_Willis	got it working. Thanks!
2010-09-11T11:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	MACscr	 you can remove/purge them afterwards and it should get rid of the configs.
2010-09-11T11:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	MACscr	 i recall ubuntu-tweak having a  thing for that also.
2010-11-14T14:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	MACscr	 its in the users home dir. I forget where exactly.
2010-11-14T14:02:00.000Z	MACscr	Dr_Willis	like i said, i figured it out. Thanks though
