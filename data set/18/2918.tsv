2010-04-02T19:25:00.000Z	Milp_main		After i installed the b43 driver for my wifi adapter and rebooted ubuntu, it is completely gone! Not even lspci shows it anymore (which it did before) someone please help!
2010-04-02T19:26:00.000Z	Draglor	Milp_main	b43 should be in kernel since some kernel version .. is "lsmod|grep b43" showing something?
2010-04-02T19:27:00.000Z	Milp_main	Draglor	no it doesnt show up
2010-04-02T19:27:00.000Z	Milp_main	Draglor	im using karmic btw
2010-04-02T19:29:00.000Z	Milp_main	Draglor	it shows b43 to be loaded among other modules
2010-04-02T19:30:00.000Z	Milp_main	Draglor	hmm no actually nothing changed, lspci still doesnt show it, neither does the driver manager show b43 to be loaded and iwconfig is still the same too :(
2010-04-02T19:32:00.000Z	Draglor	Milp_main	do you have something in /lib/firmware/b43 ?
2010-04-02T19:37:00.000Z	Milp_main	Draglor	erUSUL yes, i will try reinstalling it again. I tried once already using synaptic, but ill try using apt-get too
2010-04-02T19:37:00.000Z	Milp_main	Draglor	erUSUL if this doesnt work ill just use my usb stick and reinstall the whole box again
2010-04-02T19:38:00.000Z	Milp_main	Draglor	erUSUL on a sidenote i should maybe mention that the Wifi on/off button on my laptop that runs it doesnt work, the led stays off, but the bios says its on
2010-04-02T19:38:00.000Z	Draglor	Milp_main	that should have be mentioned
2010-04-02T19:40:00.000Z	Milp_main	Draglor	erUSUL well, i did the whole tailf and modprobe thing after reinstalling fwcutter, but its still the same
2010-04-02T19:40:00.000Z	Milp_main	Draglor	how do i use rfkill?
2010-04-02T19:42:00.000Z	Draglor	Milp_main	probably it won't work .. on my brothers laptop it's the same ... you even can't enable the switch in bios, you can only enable "last state" .. my brother had to install windows, enable the wifi, and then reinstall his ubuntu ..
2010-04-02T19:42:00.000Z	Milp_main	Draglor	well wifi is enabled in bios though
2010-04-02T19:44:00.000Z	Milp_main	Draglor	uuh there is a LAN/WLAN switching option which is off
2010-04-02T19:46:00.000Z	Milp_main	Draglor	erUSUL i rebooted with my ethernet cable pulled out and now it shows up and works perfectly
2010-04-02T19:48:00.000Z	Milp_main	Draglor	nah actually no, i actually rebooted a few times before
