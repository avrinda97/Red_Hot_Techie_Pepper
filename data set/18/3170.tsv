2009-11-25T12:25:00.000Z	Jordan_U	FlailingWalrus	Do you see menu entries
2009-11-25T12:26:00.000Z	FlailingWalrus	Jordan_U	Menu entries... Im not entirely sure. Everything else seems to be working just fine. Like I said Im rather new to this and not all there
2009-11-25T12:27:00.000Z	Jordan_U	FlailingWalrus	First, what is the exact error that you get when you try to boot? Second, do you see a menu with entries for your kernels if you hold shift during boot?
2009-11-25T12:28:00.000Z	FlailingWalrus	Jordan_U	The exact error that occurs is when I try to boot Ubuntu it takes me to a grubs page. When I then try to get it to boot it says there are no loaded kernels. I have not tried holding shift during boot though. Should I go try that and come back here?
2009-11-25T12:34:00.000Z	Jordan_U	FlailingWalrus	Try holding shift during boot and when you get to the grub menu press "e" to see the menu entry, one thing you might try is removing the line that begins with "search"
2009-11-25T12:38:00.000Z	FlailingWalrus	Jordan_U	Hey yah wouldnt even let me do the hold shift thing. Took me straight to a GNU Grubs page
2009-11-25T12:39:00.000Z	Jordan_U	FlailingWalrus	Did it bring you to a shell that said "rescue"?
2009-11-25T12:39:00.000Z	FlailingWalrus	Jordan_U	No it did not
2009-11-25T12:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	FlailingWalrus	What did the screen look like?
2009-11-25T12:40:00.000Z	FlailingWalrus	Jordan_U	At the very top it explained that it was a GNU Grubs page that used basic bash! to get going
2009-11-25T12:41:00.000Z	Jordan_U	FlailingWalrus	Was there anything interactive at all or was it just a frozen screen?
2009-11-25T12:42:00.000Z	FlailingWalrus	Jordan_U	It was all pretty well interactive. I could attempt to boot still, though thats when I get the no loaded kernels thing, I could reboot and had a variety of options when I hit tab.
2009-11-25T12:43:00.000Z	Jordan_U	FlailingWalrus	Ok, so there was a prompt like "grub>" ?
2009-11-25T12:44:00.000Z	FlailingWalrus	Jordan_U	Actually am reading something about that now, and I never tried that one
2009-11-25T12:44:00.000Z	FlailingWalrus	Jordan_U	Like if I did something like that it would load up a kernel - grub> kernel /vmlinuz root=/dev/hda1
2009-11-25T12:46:00.000Z	Jordan_U	FlailingWalrus	Can you be on IRC and in that shell at the same time?
2009-11-25T12:46:00.000Z	FlailingWalrus	Jordan_U	Hmm... One moment
2009-11-25T12:48:00.000Z	FlailingWalrus	Jordan_U	I should be able to. Im currently loading pidgin on another computer
