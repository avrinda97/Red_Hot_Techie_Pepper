2009-03-04T08:16:00.000Z	Comrade-Sergei		I just installed ubuntu server and for whatever reason it didnt grab the dns from DHCP , how do i set it manually?
2009-03-04T08:16:00.000Z	nightrid3r	Comrade-Sergei	/etc/resolve.conf
2009-03-04T08:17:00.000Z	Comrade-Sergei	nightrid3r	thats what i thought, but there isnt one
2009-03-04T08:17:00.000Z	Comrade-Sergei	nightrid3r	i tried to make one and it didnt help
2009-03-04T08:19:00.000Z	nightrid3r	Comrade-Sergei	nameserver 192.168.2.1 <-- put in /etc/resolv.conf (addjust ip)
2009-03-04T08:20:00.000Z	Comrade-Sergei	nightrid3r	i did it didnt help, however there is a folder in there called resolvconf
2009-03-04T08:21:00.000Z	nightrid3r	Comrade-Sergei	weird, that was the contents of my resolv.conf and it works for me
2009-03-04T08:22:00.000Z	Comrade-Sergei	nightrid3r	it will not go to the internet...
2009-03-04T08:23:00.000Z	Comrade-Sergei	nightrid3r	but it will go to the router
2009-03-04T08:25:00.000Z	Comrade-Sergei	nightrid3r	should i restart the interface?
2009-03-04T08:25:00.000Z	nightrid3r	Comrade-Sergei	could help yes
2009-03-04T08:26:00.000Z	Comrade-Sergei	nightrid3r	how do i restart it, i cant just go up down as im connected via ssh
2009-03-04T08:28:00.000Z	nightrid3r	Comrade-Sergei	you'll lose connection anyway but sudo ifdown eth0 && sudo ifup eth0 & should do it
2009-03-04T08:30:00.000Z	Comrade-Sergei	nightrid3r	nope still says "connect: network is unreachable"
2009-03-04T08:31:00.000Z	nightrid3r	Comrade-Sergei	sounds like a routing problem, is the gateway ip the one of your modem
2009-03-04T08:31:00.000Z	Comrade-Sergei	nightrid3r	however i can still obviously ssh in locally
2009-03-04T08:32:00.000Z	Comrade-Sergei	nightrid3r	well theres a wireless router between them that acts as a wired switch as well
