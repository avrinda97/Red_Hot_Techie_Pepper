2007-05-04T16:46:00.000Z	predaeus	mon^rch	by default all ports should be open
2007-05-04T16:47:00.000Z	mon^rch	predaeus	um, no...
2007-05-04T05:01:00.000Z	predaeus	mon^rch	unless you change firewall settings to begin with, all ports are open in linux. iptables handles firewall settings and on a fresh install there are no iptables rules set.
2007-05-04T05:03:00.000Z	mon^rch	predaeus	I'm not a firewall expert... I just know how to make my amule work ;)
2007-05-04T05:05:00.000Z	predaeus	mon^rch	I've just opened router ports for that, you should not need to change anything else unless you are running some adsl tunneling modem setup that includes iptables rules that would need to be tweaked
2007-05-04T05:06:00.000Z	mon^rch	predaeus	as far as I know iptables IS the router and you HAVE to open ports for stuff to work... amule, ftp, ssamba, http etc... no?
2007-05-04T05:08:00.000Z	predaeus	mon^rch	nah actually by default everything is open. it is not like windows where a lot of services are running that are potential security holes. if you don't run any servers you are quite safe with linux. if you use firestarter I think it changes the iptables rules to block everything and then you add rules to allow things to pass
2007-05-04T05:09:00.000Z	predaeus	mon^rch	you can list iptables rules like "sudo iptables -L -t mangle"   "sudo iptables -L -t filter" and so on see man iptables
2007-05-04T05:10:00.000Z	mon^rch	predaeus	well ahem I run 3 different servers on my box here and I had to edit iptables to open the ports... I just use firestarter to do it because I am not too literate in linux shell yet
2007-05-04T05:11:00.000Z	mon^rch	predaeus	and what the hell good is a firewall if all the ports are open?
2007-05-04T05:11:00.000Z	predaeus	mon^rch	weird. Probably you ran firestarter before and it blocked everything or something like that
2007-05-04T05:12:00.000Z	predaeus	mon^rch	if no process is running for that port than nothing can happen, as nobody is answering
2007-05-04T05:12:00.000Z	mon^rch	predaeus	again... I'm no expert
2007-05-04T05:12:00.000Z	predaeus	mon^rch	the kernel will jsut respond that nothing is listening on that port. of course you can hide your ports by setting firewall rules that stop those answers and prevent portscans to work
2007-05-04T05:13:00.000Z	predaeus	mon^rch	neither am I, I also keep learning things everyday in IRC channels.
2007-05-04T05:13:00.000Z	mon^rch	predaeus	wonderful education at times, isn't it?
2007-05-04T05:14:00.000Z	predaeus	mon^rch	yup unfortunately here it is mostly wifi and printer and gfx driver problems so not too interesting but the programming language channels are nice. but this is goin offtopic ;-)
2007-05-04T05:15:00.000Z	mon^rch	predaeus	nods
