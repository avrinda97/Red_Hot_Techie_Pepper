2010-09-19T07:00:00.000Z	Name141		Is it possible, from default, to install Ubuntu with min stuff for older machines? No GUI, etc?
2010-09-19T07:01:00.000Z	Name141		Or will I have to remove everything I don't want myself?
2010-09-19T07:01:00.000Z	trakinas	Name141	i *think* there is an option on the menu
2010-09-19T07:02:00.000Z	Name141	trakinas	Should I look for it during the install
2010-09-19T07:02:00.000Z	trakinas	Name141	when you boot you can choose different kinds of instalation, I believe
2010-09-19T07:02:00.000Z	Name141	trakinas	Ok, I'll turn it on and see what happens
2010-09-19T07:03:00.000Z	Name141	trakinas	it's an old pentium 2 with 10GB hard drive.. I thought it'd be worth using for something atleast
2010-09-19T07:04:00.000Z	trakinas	Name141	Id go with debian or even gentoo and custom it myself during install. but I like to suffer.
2010-09-19T07:04:00.000Z	Name141	trakinas	I liked debian 'ok'
2010-09-19T07:05:00.000Z	Name141	trakinas	but I had to hunt and search around to figure out where to get the debs
2010-09-19T07:06:00.000Z	trakinas	Name141	I usually do "aptitude search **** " before looking for them =P
2010-09-19T07:10:00.000Z	Name141	trakinas	sorry, I meant the actual mirrors and places
2010-09-19T07:11:00.000Z	trakinas	Name141	np. I was just mockering. sometimes my source.list has more unofficial mirrors than officials.
2010-09-19T07:13:00.000Z	Name141	trakinas	I didn't find a place to select min or anything at all.  Just 'forward forward.. forward.. type in user.. install"
2010-09-19T07:14:00.000Z	trakinas	Name141	when you boot. you can choose what kind of boot. I think there is an option there
2010-09-19T07:14:00.000Z	Name141	trakinas	well I was more looking to save on disk space..
2010-09-19T07:15:00.000Z	Name141	trakinas	then use SSH / sftp or Samba
2010-09-19T07:16:00.000Z	Name141	trakinas	seeing as it is 10GBs just sitting around doing nothing
