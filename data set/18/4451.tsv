2009-05-22T22:48:00.000Z	ManDay		Can anyone tell me where and how to adjust the main-menu so the items for "shutdown" etc dont appear in it anymore?!
2009-05-22T22:49:00.000Z	Chr|s	ManDay	System > Preferences > Main Menu
2009-05-22T22:49:00.000Z	ManDay	Chr|s	I don't see options for everything there
2009-05-22T22:50:00.000Z	ManDay	Chr|s	there is nothing to remove the shutdown button etc is there?
2009-05-22T22:50:00.000Z	Chr|s	ManDay	you talking about the panel or the menu?
2009-05-22T22:51:00.000Z	ManDay		Well the menu. No matter whether I choose "Main Menu" or "Menu Bar" the Properties Dialog doesnt offer anything to fully customize it,  Chr|s
2009-05-22T22:52:00.000Z	Chr|s	ManDay	What do you exactly want to do? Their is nothing in the gnome menu to remove the shut down button
2009-05-22T22:53:00.000Z	Chr|s	ManDay	If your talking about the Top Panel to the far right, you just right click and remove
2009-05-22T22:53:00.000Z	ManDay		I see Chr|s and thats what bothers me.  Same for the "Menu bar". I cant remove the shortcut to "Places" from it?
2009-05-22T22:53:00.000Z	ManDay		!
2009-05-22T22:54:00.000Z	Chr|s	ManDay	I'm not entirely sure, if you make a custom menu yes I think, but why would you want to remove Places?
2009-05-22T22:55:00.000Z	ManDay		Simply because I want a custom menu. And I dont want a link to "places" in there
2009-05-22T22:55:00.000Z	ManDay		I dunno whats the point of the custom menu if you can hardly configure it besides the subentries
2009-05-22T22:55:00.000Z	ManDay		, Chr|s
2009-05-22T22:56:00.000Z	ManDay		oh crap... never and I say NEVER consider to put a "gnome-terminal" into your .bashrc
2009-05-22T22:56:00.000Z	ManDay		thats NOT what you want
2009-05-22T22:57:00.000Z	ManDay		can anyone tell me where to place a command for execution upon startup?!
2009-05-22T23:00:00.000Z	Chr|s	ManDay	hmm I see.. That is odd, i'm not sure to tell you the truth, their has to be some way, idle in here, maybe someone else could help you.
