2006-03-09T12:13:00.000Z	Wolfwood		libraries, dude
2006-03-09T12:13:00.000Z	Wolfwood		I'd like to turn an old Power Mac into a dumb terminal to my Linux machine :)
2006-03-09T12:14:00.000Z	cafuego	Wolfwood	define "old"
2006-03-09T12:15:00.000Z	cafuego	Wolfwood	*nod* You'll want a small MacOS 8 partition on those, so you cna bootstrap Linux hsing 'bootx'.
2006-03-09T12:16:00.000Z	cafuego	Wolfwood	I advise against trying to run Gnome on any of them, though :-)
2006-03-09T12:17:00.000Z	cafuego	Wolfwood	Aaah!
2006-03-09T12:18:00.000Z	cafuego	Wolfwood	I wonder if those macs support etherboot at all...
2006-03-09T12:18:00.000Z	cafuego	Wolfwood	Yes, but OSX was never really designed for pre-G3 macs.
2006-03-09T12:19:00.000Z	cafuego	Wolfwood	How old is that FC installation on the mac mini?
2006-03-09T12:19:00.000Z	cafuego	Wolfwood	Have a look at k12ltsp
2006-03-09T12:20:00.000Z	cafuego	Wolfwood	fc4 should also support ltsp actually, which would be what you're after.
2006-03-09T12:20:00.000Z	cafuego	Wolfwood	it netbooks the terminals disklessly, then gives you an ssh-tunneled gfx login on the server.
2006-03-09T12:22:00.000Z	cafuego	Wolfwood	An easier middle-ground would be to install X on each of the clients and simply use xdmcp.
2006-03-09T12:22:00.000Z	cafuego	Wolfwood	tunneling X over ssh on a 75MHz 603 might be pushing it.
2006-03-09T12:23:00.000Z	cafuego	Wolfwood	Yes, xdmcp isn't tunneled, so less secure, but possibly faster on slow hardware.
2006-03-09T12:23:00.000Z	cafuego	Wolfwood	for xdmcp you'd also want  a local minimal HD install of system + X server + login manager
2006-03-09T12:52:00.000Z	cafuego	Wolfwood	There's an activex virus for iexplore that does that
