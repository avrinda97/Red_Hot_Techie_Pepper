2006-12-09T13:24:00.000Z	econobeing		i am under the impression ktorrent doesn't like me looking at it
2006-12-09T13:25:00.000Z	econobeing		every time i focus on the window i see my torrent at around 5 or 8 k, then it drops back down to 0. go do something else, come back it's around 5-8k, drops down to 0 again...
2006-12-09T13:25:00.000Z	econobeing		bleh...maybe i should just use azureus, but from my previous install, ktorrent > azureus
2006-12-09T13:26:00.000Z	_goofy_	econobeing	i use utorrent emulated with wine and i get great dl speads.....its a little glitchy but it works for me
2006-12-09T13:28:00.000Z	_goofy_		im having trouble streaming video off a usb hdd anyone have a clue
2006-12-09T13:28:00.000Z	econobeing	_goofy_	how hard was it to get that working?
2006-12-09T13:28:00.000Z	econobeing		because utorrent is my favorite
2006-12-09T13:30:00.000Z	_goofy_		its just like any wine install...the only problem is when you minimize the window you will get a blank screen when you go back ang you have to right click on the task bar icon and seclect hide/show utorrent
