2009-11-18T18:06:00.000Z	JoshuaL		I have a audio cd (legal) and I wanna rip it into MP3, what program can I use best to do so?
2009-11-18T18:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JoshuaL	there is no best
2009-11-18T18:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JoshuaL	there is no best, if there were the other projects would cease as noboy would use anything else
2009-11-18T18:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JoshuaL	there is no best anything ever, even ife is not best for some people
2009-11-18T18:07:00.000Z	JoshuaL	ActionParsnip	you are totally right
2010-02-11T01:05:00.000Z	JoshuaL	ActionParsnip	but isnt that a bit dirty for something I want to be unset by default?
2010-08-21T00:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JoshuaL	there is no best app for anything
2010-08-21T00:15:00.000Z	JoshuaL	ActionParsnip	your right ;-) any application you recommend? :p
2010-08-21T00:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JoshuaL	there are options and preferences and abilities, none are outright best. Each one may excel in a different way
2010-08-21T00:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JoshuaL	handbrake or mencoder
2010-08-21T00:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JoshuaL	won't it play the files as they are?
2010-08-21T00:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JoshuaL	what format are they?
2010-08-21T00:16:00.000Z	JoshuaL	ActionParsnip	usually mkv. it has to be MP4 (with AAC audio) like ZykoticK9 said
2010-08-21T00:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JoshuaL	wow that's pretty poor, thought the ipad was meant to be amazing...
2010-08-21T00:17:00.000Z	JoshuaL	ActionParsnip	i hoped it would support more formats too
2010-08-21T00:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JoshuaL	maybe ffmpeg can do it
2010-08-21T00:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	JoshuaL	more rasons for folks not to buy one "by the way we don't support too many formats cos we're dumb so you'll need to convert ALL you stuff to fit around the lack of features"
2010-08-21T00:19:00.000Z	JoshuaL	ActionParsnip	i can live with it, but it would have been nice if it did support more formats indeed
