2006-08-17T12:48:00.000Z	Ademan		can you configure the gnome menu with an xml file?
2006-08-17T12:48:00.000Z	harisund	Ademan	technically speaking, you definitely can.
2006-08-17T12:49:00.000Z	Ademan	harisund	what do you mean technically speaking? is it practically possible? like for the end user?
2006-08-17T12:49:00.000Z	harisund	Ademan	there is a tool called Alacarte I think that's supposed to help edit the menus. You will be better off with that.
2006-08-17T12:51:00.000Z	harisund	Ademan	so did you manage to do what you want? Or are you still looking at the editing xml fiels options?
2006-10-09T13:37:00.000Z	Ademan	harisund	checkinstall is python?
2006-10-09T13:37:00.000Z	harisund	Ademan	I don't know. Why?
2006-10-09T13:37:00.000Z	harisund	Ademan	no no... apt-get build-dep python installs all the necessary packages to compile python 2.4.
2006-10-09T13:38:00.000Z	Ademan	harisund	you're right, i thought you said apt-get install, i always assume install lol
2006-10-09T13:38:00.000Z	harisund	Ademan	this- Right now, tcl is missing, so you install that. Then you try again, and this time something else is missing. You then install that.
2006-10-09T13:39:00.000Z	harisund	Ademan	but if you execute the build-dep everything you need to compile and build python2.4 from source is pulled. In most cases, python2.5 (the one that patbam wants) will have the same requirements.
2006-10-09T13:40:00.000Z	Ademan	harisund	wait i just thought he was trying to get checkinstall... or was that so that he could get the latest version of python?
2006-10-09T13:40:00.000Z	harisund	Ademan	he wants to use checkinstall to install the latest python2.5
2006-10-09T13:40:00.000Z	harisund	Ademan	so that he gets a .deb file that integrates nicely with the package management system.
2006-10-09T13:40:00.000Z	Ademan	harisund	OOOHHHHHHHH, it all makes sense now
2006-10-09T13:51:00.000Z	Ademan	harisund	it all depends on the program, i'd expect python to take 10 minutes at least
2006-10-09T13:56:00.000Z	Ademan	harisund	pthread = posix thread
2006-10-09T13:56:00.000Z	harisund	Ademan	oh! I remember that word from my Operating Systems class!
