2007-08-27T13:55:00.000Z	_blix_		here is more detail
2007-08-27T13:55:00.000Z	_blix_		Right now, I'm running from a live CD
2007-08-27T13:56:00.000Z	_blix_		ok
2007-08-27T13:57:00.000Z	_blix_		Right now, I'm running from a Live CD, I need my 160gig drive formatted to NTFS so what I can get my Windows XP disc to boot up and get my HD recognised to continue the setup
2007-08-27T13:57:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	_blix_	WHat version of WIndows are you trying to install
2007-08-27T13:58:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	_blix_	The XP install didnt see any drives?
2007-08-27T13:59:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	_blix_	Very odd...  IF you are running live cd go to term and type sudo fdisk -l      last is an L
2007-08-27T14:01:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	_blix_	It didn't show any partitions?
2007-08-27T14:02:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	_blix_	XP installer may not see the partition but it has to see the drive if fdisk sees it
2007-08-27T14:03:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	_blix_	You wanted to make sure it was clean, so let XP partition and fomat it again.
2007-08-27T14:04:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	_blix_	No reason to fat32... it will do ntfs
2007-08-27T14:07:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	_blix_	Ask in #WIndows.... The problem is not ubuntu or linux related.
