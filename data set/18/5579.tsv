2008-10-14T07:57:00.000Z	ubuntu_todd		what's this problem wisdom@wisdom-laptop:~/Desktop$ sudo synclient Touchpadoff=0           Can't access shared memory area. SHMConfig disabled?
2008-10-14T07:58:00.000Z	harriseldon	ubuntu_todd	in order to use synclient, a special area of memory needs to be enabled. In default Ubuntu, it is not enabled
2008-10-14T07:59:00.000Z	harriseldon	ubuntu_todd	you need to edit your xorg.conf and the line Option SHMConfig "Enabled" in the section for the touchpad device
2008-10-14T08:14:00.000Z	ubuntu_todd	harriseldon	Doesn't work. I add this into my xorg.conf Option  "SHMConfig"  "Enable"
2008-10-14T08:16:00.000Z	harriseldon	ubuntu_todd	where did you add it?
2008-10-14T08:16:00.000Z	harriseldon	ubuntu_todd	did you log out and log back in?
2008-10-14T08:17:00.000Z	harriseldon	ubuntu_todd	you are correct
2008-10-14T08:19:00.000Z	ubuntu_todd	harriseldon	It doesn't work neither Enable nor On
2008-10-14T08:19:00.000Z	harriseldon	ubuntu_todd	I have it enabled for me and it works. Did you logout? changes to xorg.conf do not take effect until you logout. Plus it needs to be in the correct section.
2008-10-14T08:20:00.000Z	ubuntu_todd	harriseldon	Should I reboot? Or just ctrl+alt+backspace is enough?
2008-10-14T08:21:00.000Z	harriseldon	ubuntu_todd	ctrl-alt-backspace is enough. Try to avoid that because it abruptly closes x. Use the logout instead if you can.
2008-10-14T08:22:00.000Z	ubuntu_todd	harriseldon	how to logout?
2008-10-14T08:22:00.000Z	ubuntu_todd	harriseldon	should I close all the windows and applications?
2008-10-14T08:23:00.000Z	harriseldon	ubuntu_todd	you probably made the change in the wrong section of the xorg.conf
2008-10-14T08:24:00.000Z	harriseldon	ubuntu_todd	it should be in the section labeled Section "InputDevice" Identifier "Synaptics Touchpad"
2008-10-14T08:24:00.000Z	ubuntu_todd	harriseldon	http://paste.ubuntu.com/57262/
2008-10-14T08:25:00.000Z	harriseldon	ubuntu_todd	that is exactly what I have in my xorg.conf and it works
2008-10-14T08:29:00.000Z	ubuntu_todd	harriseldon	you mean logout is better than ctrl+alt+backspace?
