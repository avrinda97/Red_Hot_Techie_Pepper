2009-08-13T09:38:00.000Z	emma		I am sure that someone will try to silence me soon. I am telling you the truth. Look into it.
2009-08-13T09:38:00.000Z	emma		UBUNTU USERS --- If you are using Ubuntu and browing the web. If firefox crashes on you DO NOT SEND THE APORT BUG REPORT. It will send your pivate data to the Ubuntu devs. You do not want them having your gmail passwords, etc.
2009-08-13T09:39:00.000Z	mzz	emma	got any information to back that up?
2009-08-13T09:40:00.000Z	mzz	emma	can you link to a bug report or whatever about this problem, or one it occurred in?
2009-08-13T09:40:00.000Z	mzz	emma	you'll stand a better chance of something actually being done about this with those
2009-08-13T09:40:00.000Z	emma	mzz	No because apport is kept 'private' for just this reason. But why would the ubuntu devs think that we would be okay with them seeing our private data?
2009-08-13T09:40:00.000Z	mzz	emma	(just complaining about it in some irc channel with zero backup of your claims is not a good way to get something fixed)
2009-08-13T09:41:00.000Z	mzz	emma	I'm new to ubuntu, haven't hit apport yet, let me poke it
2009-08-13T09:41:00.000Z	emma	mzz	-- be cautious.
2009-08-13T09:41:00.000Z	emma	mzz	-- this is not some random channel this is #ubuntu and this will get things rolling.
2009-08-13T09:41:00.000Z	mzz	emma	still, you should file a bug about this, and/or provide evidence (steps to trigger an apport report with information in it that shouldn't be there)
2009-08-13T09:49:00.000Z	mzz	emma	so! this seems to be off by default for stable, it *does* warn that there may be sensitive data in there too. What's the actual problem here, that the core dump part isn't actually viewable in "Content of the report"?
2009-08-13T09:49:00.000Z	mzz	emma	also, stop being horribly vague
2009-08-13T09:52:00.000Z	mzz	emma	have you read both the apport wiki page and the actual apport ui presented to you when submitting an apport report?
2009-08-13T09:52:00.000Z	emma	mzz	-- You are being an apologist.
2009-08-13T09:53:00.000Z	mzz	emma	I don't know what the opposite of an apologist is, but that's you :P
2009-08-13T09:54:00.000Z	mzz	emma	how many ordinary users have apport enabled? Have you actually triggered the apport ui, or are you just duplicating info you've heard elsewhere?
