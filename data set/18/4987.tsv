2009-01-05T11:02:00.000Z	nsadmin		first, install a text irc client like irssi or bitchx
2009-01-05T11:03:00.000Z	nsadmin		let me see...
2009-01-05T11:03:00.000Z	nsadmin		you'll have to come back here as root
2009-01-05T11:04:00.000Z	nsadmin		I don't know :)
2009-01-05T11:04:00.000Z	nsadmin		probably it will but I didn't see his idea
2009-01-05T11:05:00.000Z	nsadmin		I was thinking maybe he didn't want to reboot
2009-01-05T11:05:00.000Z	nsadmin		so she doesn't care about that, ok
2009-01-05T11:07:00.000Z	nsadmin		it's a way to make this whole process easier in the future
2009-01-05T11:07:00.000Z	nsadmin		but it would be hard to set up if you're already running
2009-01-05T11:08:00.000Z	nsadmin		how to find if tdom is packaged for ubuntu and what versions are in what version of ubuntu
2009-01-05T11:08:00.000Z	raylu	nsadmin	use your package manager
2009-01-05T11:09:00.000Z	raylu	nsadmin	http://packages.ubuntu.com
2009-01-05T11:38:00.000Z	raylu	nsadmin	remu: don't you want to see ifconfig first?
2009-01-05T11:51:00.000Z	raylu	nsadmin	remu: you haven't seen ifconfig yet :D
2009-01-05T13:03:00.000Z	raylu	nsadmin	dist-upgrade
2009-01-05T12:40:00.000Z	nsadmin	raylu	sometimes I get the feeling that women use talking to go through feeling states
2009-01-05T13:03:00.000Z	raylu	nsadmin	true, but he never specified how he wanted them renamed :P
2009-01-05T13:03:00.000Z	raylu	nsadmin	there's also semi-dangerous-but-usually-safe-upgrade
