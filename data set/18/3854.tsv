2009-07-19T00:19:00.000Z	skypilot		i've got speaker-test -Dplug:surround51 -c6 -l1 -twav playing all channels, but when i play music i can't get it to play out the rear speakers (pulse audio and audigy2)
2009-07-19T00:19:00.000Z	mzz	skypilot	I think I saw the pulseaudio wiki mention that, but I don't know if it applies to ubuntu.
2009-07-19T00:20:00.000Z	mzz	skypilot	http://www.pulseaudio.org/wiki/FAQ#IhaveasurroundsoundcardbutPulseAudiousesjustthefrontspeakers but you should definitely ask for a second opinion, I'm not familiar with ubuntu's pulse setup
2009-07-19T00:21:00.000Z	skypilot	mzz	thanks, also, i just got it to work with OSS, should i just settle for that, or is there a real benefit for getting pulseaudio working?
2009-07-19T00:21:00.000Z	mzz	skypilot	I'm not sure anymore.
2009-07-19T00:21:00.000Z	skypilot	mzz	lol thanks
2009-07-19T00:22:00.000Z	mzz	skypilot	it may be a bit of a hassle to get rid of it completely on an ubuntu system (it integrates in a couple of places afaik).
2009-07-19T00:22:00.000Z	mzz	skypilot	and in some cases it may actually be useful, especially if you're on a laptop with multiple outputs or ever want to output over the network.
2009-07-19T00:23:00.000Z	skypilot	mzz	thanks for the link, i actually made that edit from help i found elsewhere, but hadn't restarted pulseaudio, gonna try that now
2009-07-19T00:26:00.000Z	skypilot	mzz	W: alsa-util.c: Device hw:0 doesn't support 6 channels, changed to 2.
2009-07-19T00:29:00.000Z	mzz	skypilot	huh, odd. Do you have multiple devices?
2009-07-19T00:30:00.000Z	mzz	skypilot	iirc "aplay -l" may be interesting.
2009-07-19T00:30:00.000Z	mzz	skypilot	been a while though.

2009-07-19T00:44:00.000Z	skypilot	mzz	ohwow, just put on a flash vid and it's coming out the rear speakers too!
2009-07-19T00:44:00.000Z	skypilot	mzz	hmm, music's working too now, sounds like i've got it for now.
2009-07-19T00:56:00.000Z	mzz	skypilot	hmm, sounds like you somehow need "Device 3" instead of the first one
2009-07-19T00:56:00.000Z	skypilot	mzz	maybe, but it seems to be working on all the speakers now :3
