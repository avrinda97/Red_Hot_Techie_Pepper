2008-01-27T03:25:00.000Z	bim	mainr30	what tutorial?
2008-01-27T03:26:00.000Z	bim	mainr30	do what martyn said and report back if it doesn't work.
2008-01-27T03:29:00.000Z	bim	mainr30	I don't see any grub instructions there.
2008-01-27T03:36:00.000Z	bim	mainr30	I found the bad instructions on p2 of your tutorial. Go to System > Administration > Startup-Manager and put the resolution back to something unstupid.
2008-01-27T03:38:00.000Z	bim	mainr30	then follow his instructions to boot livecd and reconstruct grub. Using that screen put a bad screen resolution into your grub config.
2008-01-27T03:39:00.000Z	bim	mainr30	if a reinstall isn't a giant tragedy, it might be the simplest path for you.
2008-01-27T03:43:00.000Z	bim	mainr30	ubuntu will cheerfully deploy the LAMP components and also samba. It's just a matter of what you install and configure.
2008-01-27T03:43:00.000Z	bim	mainr30	yes
