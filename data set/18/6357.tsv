2008-05-28T18:58:00.000Z	pappan		firefox 3 beta 5
2008-05-28T18:58:00.000Z	pappan		Installed firefox 2 also..but it's all the same with FF2 also
2008-05-28T18:58:00.000Z	movedx	pappan	what's not working for FF, sorry?
2008-05-28T18:59:00.000Z	pappan	movedx	, When I am clicking on a button whose form action is a post, it hangs there.. Either prompt me for download that page or gives a white blank file
2008-05-28T19:00:00.000Z	movedx	pappan	sounds like a remote server issue, incorrectly configured Apache/HTTPd mime-type - does it happen on any site?
2008-05-28T19:04:00.000Z	movedx	pappan	sounds like FF, then, not processing the output fromt he server correctly.
2008-05-28T19:04:00.000Z	movedx	pappan	try and do it with Opera
2008-05-28T19:05:00.000Z	pappan	movedx	thanks. It is not even communicating with the server..Though it shows "waiting for.." live http headers is not showing any communication.. What could be a work around you would suggest
2008-05-28T19:06:00.000Z	movedx	pappan	sounds like the connection between your PC and the remote server, or a very odd software fault.
2008-05-28T19:06:00.000Z	movedx	pappan	Have you tried clearing your cache and trying again, after a complete restart of FF?
