2007-10-18T23:02:00.000Z	madrazr		Is there any way by which I can download the correctness of the GUTSY iso image downloaded
2007-10-18T23:03:00.000Z	DShepherd	madrazr	you want to check the correctness of the iso you downloaded?
2007-10-18T23:03:00.000Z	madrazr	DShepherd	There was some problem in the download
2007-10-18T23:06:00.000Z	madrazr	DShepherd	I had a problem during download. I started the download using cURL, but it stopped after 94% but I could not resume, so used torrents to download the remaining part, so does this work, I want to verify
2007-10-18T23:07:00.000Z	DShepherd	madrazr	md5sum file.iso and compare the output to this page http://releases.ubuntu.com/7.10/MD5SUMS
2007-10-18T23:08:00.000Z	DShepherd	madrazr	md5sum is a command so run that in terminal.
2007-10-18T23:08:00.000Z	madrazr	DShepherd	md5 what is the parameter??
2007-10-18T23:09:00.000Z	DShepherd	madrazr	the full path to the iso image that you downloaded
2007-10-18T23:10:00.000Z	madrazr	DShepherd	PovAddict: the value returned by the command should match with what is given here??  http://releases.ubuntu.com/7.10/MD5SUMS
2007-10-18T23:11:00.000Z	DShepherd	madrazr	it would match the one you downloaded
2007-10-18T23:11:00.000Z	DShepherd	madrazr	which of them did you download?
