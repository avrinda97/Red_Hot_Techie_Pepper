2006-06-14T15:36:00.000Z	fissy		surely whitespace isn't allowed?
2006-06-14T15:37:00.000Z	fissy		I thought the point of perl was to write 1000 line regular expressions to guarantee you can't be fired :D
2006-06-14T15:38:00.000Z	fissy		nooooo don't infect more people
2006-06-14T15:38:00.000Z	fissy		persevere with java and it might actually get you a job
2006-06-14T15:39:00.000Z	fissy		meanie
2006-06-14T15:39:00.000Z	fissy		what is the most obvious symptom of the slowness ikken?
2006-06-14T15:40:00.000Z	ikken	fissy	well, maximizing or focusing windows is slow sometimes
2006-06-14T15:41:00.000Z	ikken	fissy	especially Thunderbird and Flock - but GAIM chat windows load pretty fast - strangely, gedit loads slowly
2006-06-14T15:41:00.000Z	ikken	fissy	I think the problem is all the business of GNOME - running everything in Fluxbox certainly shows a speed difference
2006-06-14T15:42:00.000Z	fissy	ikken	you could try running XGL if it's general window management that is slow
2006-06-14T15:42:00.000Z	ikken	fissy	what's xgl?
2006-06-14T15:44:00.000Z	fissy	ikken	xgl is a way of getting the graphics card of your computer to draw the desktop instead of using your processor. It makes things a lot faster because you're using the power of your 3d graphics card, but it's quite complicated to set up
2006-06-14T15:44:00.000Z	ikken	fissy	well, I have a very bad graphics card, one of those "Intel Integrated" ones, do you think there would be any benefit?
2006-06-14T15:45:00.000Z	ikken	fissy	I know it supports OpenGL and all that jazz, though
2006-06-14T15:46:00.000Z	fissy	ikken	it would probably be up to the job but it is hard to configure. You said you could get everything running in fluxbox and it was noticably faster. Is there a reason you couldn't keep using fluxbox as that would be easier?
2006-06-14T15:46:00.000Z	ikken	fissy	well, I think I can deal with it - would upgrading my 512MB RAM to 2GB help at all?
2006-06-14T15:47:00.000Z	fissy		ikken... maybe if you're running out of ram now
2006-06-14T15:48:00.000Z	ikken	fissy	I'm looking into this Xgl thing, is there a terminal command to see what graphics card I have? I probably shouldn't be even bothering with this, but I'm going to try it anyway. :)
