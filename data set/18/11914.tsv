2007-08-31T11:13:00.000Z	slap_me		i dont want to dl infected stuff to my windows partition
2007-08-31T11:13:00.000Z	bruenig	slap_me	like what?
2007-08-31T11:14:00.000Z	bruenig	slap_me	what sort of viruses are you talking about
2007-08-31T11:14:00.000Z	bruenig	slap_me	you download a lot of strange exes in ubuntu and save them to run windows?
2007-08-31T11:15:00.000Z	bruenig	slap_me	but if the files themselves are good, then there is no problem
2007-08-31T11:15:00.000Z	bruenig	slap_me	well there is nothing that fits your goal because nothing so utterly useless has been created
2007-08-31T11:16:00.000Z	bruenig	slap_me	but for clients that serve windows machines, your usage of it is rather pointless
2007-08-31T11:17:00.000Z	bruenig	slap_me	no but I mean the anti virus stuff is created for machines that serve windows machines
2007-08-31T11:18:00.000Z	bruenig	slap_me	it doesn't work the way you are considering it to work is what I am saying, if you ask me if there is a utility for something crazily unnecessary and I try to specify what you are talking about because it sounds crazily unnecessary and then I figure out that my initial thought was indeed what you were talking about, what am I supposed to do?
2007-08-31T11:20:00.000Z	bruenig	slap_me	it wasn't only me, your application of it is non effectual is what I was saying
2007-08-31T11:21:00.000Z	bruenig	slap_me	look up the word non effectual
2007-08-31T11:22:00.000Z	bruenig	slap_me	at least no more than holding your hand on your head and jumping up three times with your eyes closed does
