2008-07-22T19:00:00.000Z	Dar1us		hi, I have a ubuntu system in which I accidentally zero'd the first 7 sectors. Can someone tell me what partition ID ubuntu uses by default?
2008-07-22T19:01:00.000Z	calc	Dar1us	82 i think
2008-07-22T19:01:00.000Z	Dar1us	calc	ta
2008-07-22T19:01:00.000Z	calc	Dar1us	its the standard one anyway, iirc 82 is linux 83 is linux swap
2008-07-22T19:01:00.000Z	Dar1us	calc	OK
2008-07-22T19:02:00.000Z	calc	Dar1us	had it backwards sorry, 83 is linux and 82 is linux swap
2008-07-22T19:02:00.000Z	calc	Dar1us	i just checked with fdisk
2008-07-22T19:02:00.000Z	Dar1us	calc	OK
2008-07-22T19:02:00.000Z	Dar1us	calc	well I don't have any other linux sstems handy :)
2008-07-22T19:03:00.000Z	calc	Dar1us	good luck determing what the partitioning was setup as though
2008-07-22T19:03:00.000Z	calc	Dar1us	if your system is still booted in linux you can probably figure it out, otherwise it might be somewhat hard
2008-07-22T19:04:00.000Z	Dar1us	calc	alas no
2008-07-22T19:04:00.000Z	Dar1us	calc	I need to rewrite the MBR & boot loader
2008-07-22T19:04:00.000Z	calc	Dar1us	so you'll have to guess at how many partitions and the exact geometry then
2008-07-22T19:05:00.000Z	Dar1us	calc	I downloaded Stellar Phoenix demo and it found the data partition
2008-07-22T19:05:00.000Z	Dar1us	calc	I don't recall the swap size but I did a bog standard mythbuntu install
2008-07-22T19:06:00.000Z	calc	Dar1us	oh ok, well glad it found the partition for you :)
2008-07-22T19:06:00.000Z	Dar1us	calc	yeah :)
