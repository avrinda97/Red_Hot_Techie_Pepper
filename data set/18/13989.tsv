2005-10-09T15:40:00.000Z	Kimahri	thoreauputic	i beg to differ.  you can tab-complete /etc/init.d/
2005-10-09T15:41:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Kimahri	yes, I just added that - you're right of course
2005-10-09T16:28:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Kimahri	don't encourage that, please
2005-10-09T16:30:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Kimahri	read ubotu's URL - this debate is OLD
2005-10-09T16:32:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Kimahri	*please* read the discussion on the wiki
2005-10-09T16:33:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Kimahri	in gnome-terminal type sudo -i - voila, a root shell
2005-10-09T16:38:00.000Z	Kimahri	thoreauputic	at any rate, on my install of ubuntu, it asked me for a root pass, and root is enabled.
2005-10-09T16:38:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Kimahri	you used the "expert" install option?
2005-10-09T16:38:00.000Z	Kimahri	thoreauputic	yes, i did.
2005-10-09T16:39:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Kimahri	right - that option enables root (it assumes you know what you are doing)
2005-10-09T16:39:00.000Z	Kimahri	thoreauputic	oh well.  i know how to secure systems.  ssh does not allow root to login, and neither does gdm, and it doesn't require a patched sulogin program
2005-10-09T16:41:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Kimahri	the sudo option is partly there for newer users - although it works fine for more experienced users as well - it is just "different"
2005-10-09T16:41:00.000Z	Kimahri	thoreauputic	i'm too hardcoded to the traditional superuser model :P although i do admit that the sudo method is good for new users.
2005-10-09T16:42:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Kimahri	nothing new about sudo - used in many sites sincethe 1980s afaik
2005-10-09T16:42:00.000Z	Kimahri	thoreauputic	i never said sudo was new :P
2005-10-09T16:43:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Kimahri	I know - I'll rephrase that - I just was musing that the sudo model has been used for many years :)
2005-10-09T16:43:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Kimahri	I should have been more precise :)
