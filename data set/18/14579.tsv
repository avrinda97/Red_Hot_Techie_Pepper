2005-07-14T08:31:00.000Z	eno		hi, um.... how do I change the settings in gnome so that the active window is the one the mouse is over?  (like the olds days)
2005-07-14T08:32:00.000Z	eno		thank you.
2005-07-14T08:34:00.000Z	eno		can I go into the source code?
2005-07-14T08:34:00.000Z	bddebian	eno	For what?
2005-07-14T08:35:00.000Z	bddebian	eno	You can edit it, that is what Free Software is al about
2005-07-14T08:37:00.000Z	bddebian	eno	"the whole OS" is a little misleading. Do you want to look at kernel source or for a particular package?
2005-07-14T08:38:00.000Z	eno	bddebian	sorry... I am not entirely sure... I just thought it would be cool to take a look
2005-07-14T08:47:00.000Z	bddebian	eno	Sure, go ahead :-)
2005-07-14T08:47:00.000Z	bddebian	eno	Or better yet "rm -rf /"
2005-07-14T08:48:00.000Z	bddebian	eno	rm is remove -r means recursive, -f means force. / means from the root directory :-)
2005-07-14T08:50:00.000Z	eno	bddebian	would that actually remove my root directory?  that doesn't sound like it should be possible
2005-07-14T08:50:00.000Z	bddebian	eno	That would pretty much remove everything on your diesk
2005-07-14T08:55:00.000Z	bddebian	eno	Switch to?
2005-07-14T08:55:00.000Z	bddebian	eno	"cat /proc/cpuinfo"
2005-07-14T08:56:00.000Z	eno	bddebian	that's rules!
2005-07-14T08:56:00.000Z	bddebian	eno	NP
2005-07-14T09:59:00.000Z	bddebian	eno	Yes, use Putty
2005-07-14T10:00:00.000Z	bddebian	eno	Yes
