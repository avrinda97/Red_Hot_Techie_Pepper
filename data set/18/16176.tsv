2004-11-06T07:22:00.000Z	GotD0t		for some reason firefox changed the download directory to my desktop
2004-11-06T07:22:00.000Z	GotD0t		and i just downloaded several tarballs and err... um i cant find them
2004-11-06T07:22:00.000Z	GotD0t		no
2004-11-06T07:23:00.000Z	jonoxer	GotD0t	probably either in ~ (home) or /tmp
2004-11-06T07:24:00.000Z	GotD0t	jonoxer	well i just checked and it said it was downloading all files to desktop
2004-11-06T07:25:00.000Z	jonoxer	GotD0t	go to Edit / Preferences / Downloads
2004-11-06T07:25:00.000Z	GotD0t	jonoxer	i just changed it... but still where are those files i just downloaded
2004-11-06T07:27:00.000Z	jonoxer	GotD0t	did you check the download properties like I said above?
2004-11-06T07:28:00.000Z	GotD0t	jonoxer	yes i did... it said default directory was desktop
2004-11-06T07:28:00.000Z	jonoxer	GotD0t	no, after that where I said to go to the download manager, right click and select properties
2004-11-06T07:29:00.000Z	GotD0t	jonoxer	i cant right click and select properties
2004-11-06T07:30:00.000Z	jonoxer	GotD0t	go to "Tools / Downloads", find the download, then right click on it
2004-11-06T07:30:00.000Z	jonoxer	GotD0t	so you can't right-click on anything in the download manager?
2004-11-06T07:35:00.000Z	jonoxer	GotD0t	can you see it when listing in a terminal? Try opening a terminal, do 'ls -l' and see if the file is there
2004-11-06T07:36:00.000Z	GotD0t	jonoxer	just a problem with the file browser
2004-11-06T07:36:00.000Z	GotD0t	jonoxer	wasn't refreshing
