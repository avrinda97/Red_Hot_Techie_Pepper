2011-08-19T02:26:00.000Z	Nickem		Hello, is there any workaround to get the drivers for a Broadcom BCM4306 internal wifi card working? Supposedly the 'device is not ready' due to 'firmware missing'.
2011-08-19T02:26:00.000Z	Obsidian1723	Nickem	try sudo apt-get install ndiswrapper
2011-08-19T02:26:00.000Z	Obsidian1723	Nickem	also check lspci to see if the device is seen first.
2011-08-19T02:28:00.000Z	Obsidian1723	Nickem	ideally, yeah, use an intel nic
2011-08-19T02:29:00.000Z	Nickem	Obsidian1723	Network controller: Broadcom Corporation BCM4306 802.11b/g Wireless LAN Controller (rev 03); I'm pretty sure it's seen. However, sudo apt-get install ndiswrapper returned the error of "E: Unable to locate package of ndiswrapper"
2011-08-19T02:29:00.000Z	Obsidian1723	Nickem	hang on , I'll look
2011-08-19T02:30:00.000Z	Obsidian1723	Nickem	ndiswrapper-utils-1.9
2011-08-19T02:31:00.000Z	Obsidian1723	Nickem	try that
2011-08-19T02:33:00.000Z	Obsidian1723	Nickem	have you issued an up command?
2011-08-19T02:34:00.000Z	Nickem	Obsidian1723	I have just issued the up command, and I haven't noticed the difference.
2011-08-19T02:39:00.000Z	Obsidian1723	Nickem	what does dmesg and lspci show?
2011-08-19T02:40:00.000Z	Nickem	Obsidian1723	Yes, I'll do that now.
2011-08-19T02:45:00.000Z	Nickem	Obsidian1723	here's the pastebin: http://pastebin.com/Th3NQp37    || Also, it seems that the first couple of lines from the dmesg were cut off due to the length of the response.
2011-08-19T02:45:00.000Z	Obsidian1723	Nickem	looking now
2011-08-19T02:48:00.000Z	Obsidian1723	Nickem	I see the bridge and the driver. which Ubuntu version is this?
2011-08-19T02:49:00.000Z	Nickem	Obsidian1723	Ubuntu 11.04 - it's a fresh install, save what I've tried to do to get the wireless cards to work.
2011-08-19T02:49:00.000Z	Obsidian1723	Nickem	same advice. Go LTS
2011-08-19T02:54:00.000Z	Obsidian1723	Nickem	cool
