2010-06-18T02:32:00.000Z	myrmidon		hey guys
2010-06-18T02:32:00.000Z	myrmidon		can someone explain me why the gwibber app just shows me fotoupdates on facebook?
2010-06-18T02:32:00.000Z	myrmidon		do i have to adjust something or somewhat?
2010-06-18T02:33:00.000Z	sebsebseb	myrmidon	apparantly Gwibber does  not work that well with Facebook at the moment
2010-06-18T02:33:00.000Z	myrmidon	sebsebseb	ah ok... so basically there is nothing i can do so far than to wait for updates?
2010-06-18T02:34:00.000Z	sebsebseb	myrmidon	When you use Gwibber for Facebook what do you get exactly?
2010-06-18T02:34:00.000Z	myrmidon	sebsebseb	i see only picture uploads of friends... and every photo as a single update
2010-06-18T02:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	myrmidon	I haven't bothered testing Gwibber/memenu properly myself yet, since its in a group of features, that I don't like
2010-06-18T02:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	myrmidon	however yeah the social stuff will probably be a bit more improved in 10.10
2010-06-18T02:35:00.000Z	myrmidon	sebsebseb	so basically you dont like networking :P
2010-06-18T02:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	myrmidon	I don't like some of the recent Ubuntu features,  you can pm if you want, and i'll gladlly explain what I mean
2010-06-18T02:36:00.000Z	myrmidon	sebsebseb	ok... btw, can i do this then over the air, so with this software updater? because the weird thing is, sometimes when i update ubuntu, in the GRUB loading screen there are suddenly two ubuntu versions
2010-06-18T02:37:00.000Z	sebsebseb	myrmidon	over the air?  and now something about Grub? what?
2010-06-18T02:37:00.000Z	myrmidon	sebsebseb	i mean the built in package updater
2010-06-18T02:37:00.000Z	myrmidon	sebsebseb	will it then automatically update to 10.10?
2010-06-18T02:38:00.000Z	sebsebseb	myrmidon	Yes when Ubuntu 10.10 comes out on Sunday 10th October people will be able to upgrade to it.  However at the moment I don't even know if I am going to bother on the other computer or not, since development is way to early.
2010-06-18T02:39:00.000Z	myrmidon	sebsebseb	ok! ... thanks for the help!
2010-06-18T02:39:00.000Z	myrmidon	sebsebseb	you mean about the ubuntu distri?
