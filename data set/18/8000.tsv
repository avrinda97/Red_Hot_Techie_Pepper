2007-10-25T08:09:00.000Z	kalleskaviar	heatman	you could blacklist its module and edit your xorg.conf
2007-10-25T08:10:00.000Z	heatman	kalleskaviar	could you please give me the command, i mean the stuff that i need to modify in the .conf so that would take effect?
2007-10-25T08:15:00.000Z	kalleskaviar	heatman	well you need to add the module name to /etc/modprobe/blacklist     then do a sudo modprobe -r modulename             how your xor.conf file should look depends on how it looks now.
2007-10-25T08:18:00.000Z	heatman	kalleskaviar	01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: ATI Technologies Inc 3D Rage Pro AGP 1X/2X (rev 5c) ... so i add all that to the blacklist?
2007-10-25T08:18:00.000Z	kalleskaviar	heatman	no you add the modules name.
2007-10-25T08:23:00.000Z	heatman		intel_agp              25620  1
2007-10-25T08:24:00.000Z	heatman	kalleskaviar	lol right! so would prollybe this: intel_agp
2007-10-25T08:25:00.000Z	kalleskaviar	heatman	that sounds reasonable.
2007-10-25T08:25:00.000Z	heatman	kalleskaviar	possible that there is more than one module for that agp vid card?
2007-10-25T08:26:00.000Z	kalleskaviar	heatman	don't think so.
2007-10-25T08:27:00.000Z	heatman	kalleskaviar	i get the 2 following modules when i do lsmod: intel_agp and agpgart
2007-10-25T08:28:00.000Z	kalleskaviar	heatman	well i'd try by only blacklisting intel_agp
2007-10-25T08:29:00.000Z	heatman	kalleskaviar	ok tyvm I appreciate your help!
2007-10-25T08:29:00.000Z	kalleskaviar	heatman	no probbies. don't forget to edit your xorg.conf  as well
2007-10-25T08:30:00.000Z	heatman	kalleskaviar	lol thats right was about to forget that ;)
2007-10-25T08:35:00.000Z	heatman		Where is the xorg.conf file is locate?
2007-10-25T08:37:00.000Z	heatman	kalleskaviar	to modify my xorg.conf file, I just delete everything related to my agp onboard card?
