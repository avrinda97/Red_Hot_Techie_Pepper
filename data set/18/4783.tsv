2009-02-10T08:06:00.000Z	woody86		does anyone know why when conky starts automatically on start-up, it disappears after a second or two but keeps running behind the desktop?
2009-02-10T08:07:00.000Z	woody86		pike_, in ubuntu
2009-02-10T08:09:00.000Z	Phillomath	woody86	 What have you set the own_window preference to in .conkyrc?
2009-02-10T08:11:00.000Z	woody86	Phillomath	http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/116278/
2009-02-10T08:12:00.000Z	woody86	Phillomath	but if I start Conky manually it works fine
2009-02-10T08:13:00.000Z	Phillomath		Hmm
2009-02-10T08:14:00.000Z	Phillomath	woody86	Could be something to do with the desktop being drawn after conky starts
2009-02-10T08:14:00.000Z	woody86	Phillomath	hmmm... any way to change that?
2009-02-10T08:14:00.000Z	Phillomath	woody86	Never had that problem myself but I've heard it happens
2009-02-10T08:14:00.000Z	woody86	Phillomath	ok thanks, I'll try some more Google :)
2009-02-10T08:14:00.000Z	Phillomath	woody86	In your sessions entry where you have conky set to autostart...
2009-02-10T08:15:00.000Z	woody86	Phillomath	yeah?
2009-02-10T08:15:00.000Z	Phillomath		Trwoody86: Try putting in sleep 5 before the conky command
2009-02-10T08:15:00.000Z	Phillomath	woody86	That will delay conky starting for 5 seconds
2009-02-10T08:16:00.000Z	woody86	Phillomath	ok, I'll give it a shot, thx
2009-02-10T08:16:00.000Z	Phillomath	woody86	also try changing own_window type to normal
2009-02-10T08:16:00.000Z	woody86	Phillomath	ok I'll try, thx again
2009-02-10T08:16:00.000Z	Phillomath	woody86	np
