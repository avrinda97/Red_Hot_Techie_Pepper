2010-04-14T07:29:00.000Z	sudo-su	obiwan_	how install a router D-LINK DSL-500 B en ubuntu without internet?
2010-04-14T07:30:00.000Z	obiwan_	sudo-su	you don't need to install it, it's got its own operating system inside
2010-04-14T07:31:00.000Z	sudo-su	obiwan_	but i can't conect
2010-04-14T07:31:00.000Z	sudo-su		can be because is from wubi?
2010-04-14T07:31:00.000Z	obiwan_	sudo-su	what you need to do is setup ubuntu to work with it. usually it works out of the box with networkmanager, just selecting the wireless ap and entering the password
2010-04-14T07:31:00.000Z	sudo-su	obiwan_	thank
2010-04-14T07:32:00.000Z	sudo-su		i going to try this
2010-04-14T07:32:00.000Z	obiwan_	sudo-su	maybe, maybe wubi doesn't have access to the nic resource, maybe windows is blocking it, dunno
2010-04-14T07:32:00.000Z	obiwan_	sudo-su	what you may try is booting from the livecd and trying to connect
2010-04-14T07:33:00.000Z	sudo-su	obiwan_	ok
2010-04-14T07:33:00.000Z	obiwan_	sudo-su	np, :)
