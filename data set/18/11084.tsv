2006-11-08T15:29:00.000Z	Duesentrieb		Hey guys. I'm really frustrated with dapper on my new laptop. Hardware support is more than flacky - i have no sound, redraw artefacts in gnome apps (firefox hardly usable), acpi doesn't wuite work, etc.
2006-11-08T15:29:00.000Z	Duesentrieb		so, what shall I do? try edgy? or is that likely to make things worse?
2006-11-08T15:29:00.000Z	gyaresu	Duesentrieb	Yes.
2006-11-08T15:30:00.000Z	gyaresu	Duesentrieb	Can't get any worse by the sound of it.
2006-11-08T15:30:00.000Z	Duesentrieb	gyaresu	well, ok, but is it likely to help? And how would i get a clean migration to edgy?...
2006-11-08T15:35:00.000Z	Duesentrieb	gyaresu	ok, that gives me an upgrade, but i wonder about "clean"... especially with hand-compiled stuff on the machine. Well, not much, just the asla stuff which I tried to get working, without success.
2006-11-08T15:36:00.000Z	gyaresu	Duesentrieb	Hand compiled? Like what?
2006-11-08T15:36:00.000Z	Duesentrieb	gyaresu	like configure && make && make install

2006-11-08T15:45:00.000Z	Duesentrieb	gyaresu	hehe - the fish dies on this page. code 157 :P
2006-11-08T15:45:00.000Z	gyaresu	Duesentrieb	wow.
2006-11-08T15:53:00.000Z	Duesentrieb	gyaresu	ok, swicthed all sources.list entries to edgy and trying an upgrade - if it fails, i'll blame it all on you :)
2006-11-08T15:54:00.000Z	gyaresu	Duesentrieb	Yep :)
2006-11-08T15:56:00.000Z	Duesentrieb	gyaresu	err- 38 packages will be removed. These include eclipse,  kdelibs-bin, kubuntu-desktop, ubuntu-desktop, x-window-system-core, xserver-xorg.... can that be right? it sounds *very* scary.
2006-11-08T16:05:00.000Z	gyaresu	Duesentrieb	You have to 'update' then 'upgrade' then 'dist-upgrade'
2006-11-08T16:05:00.000Z	Duesentrieb	gyaresu	the update is already done - didn't know i need a normal upgrade before a dist-upgrade... seems a bit strange... but i'll try.
2006-11-08T16:06:00.000Z	Duesentrieb	gyaresu	or should i use update-manager?
2006-11-08T16:06:00.000Z	gyaresu	Duesentrieb	nah. manually is best.
