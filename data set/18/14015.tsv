2006-11-13T13:24:00.000Z	psusi	darkx	fsck runs automatically when it is required because the partition is damaged
2006-11-13T13:26:00.000Z	psusi	darkx	let it finish the check
2006-11-13T13:29:00.000Z	psusi	darkx	you have a fat partition for windows or something?
2006-11-13T13:30:00.000Z	psusi	darkx	try manually fscking it and see if it works
2006-11-13T13:35:00.000Z	darkx	psusi	what do i do now??
2006-11-13T13:35:00.000Z	psusi	darkx	ok... let it fix it
2006-11-13T13:36:00.000Z	psusi	darkx	1
2006-11-13T13:37:00.000Z	darkx	psusi	: thanks
2006-11-13T13:38:00.000Z	darkx	psusi	: Leaving file system unchanged ??? he diden't make any changes??
2006-11-13T13:38:00.000Z	psusi	darkx	you don't have it mounted do you?
2006-11-13T13:40:00.000Z	darkx	psusi	: when i fsck again it says the same thing "Differences: (offset:original/backup)"
2006-11-13T13:41:00.000Z	psusi	darkx	you have to have the partition not mounted when you fsck it
2006-11-13T13:41:00.000Z	psusi	darkx	then add the -f flag to fsck
