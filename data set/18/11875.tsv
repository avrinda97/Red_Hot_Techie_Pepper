2006-10-20T12:36:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	gizmo_the_great1	that you didnt specify the filesysten type, though you should. or that the partition/filesystem has been damaged
2006-10-20T12:36:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	gizmo_the_great1	the filesystem type is defined by a '-t *', where * is you file system
2006-10-20T12:38:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	gizmo_the_great1	did you run any kind of file system checks, to look for coruption?
2006-10-20T12:39:00.000Z	gizmo_the_great1	nolimitsoya	no i haven't - how do I do that?
2006-10-20T12:40:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	gizmo_the_great1	fsck should do that :)
2006-10-20T12:40:00.000Z	gizmo_the_great1	nolimitsoya	i will try that - I be back
2006-10-20T12:41:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	gizmo_the_great1	that is 'sudo mount /dev/hdd5 -t ext3 /home/ted/Mounts/ext3' to mount that drive. are you sure the map you are trying to mount to exists?
2006-10-20T12:42:00.000Z	gizmo_the_great1	nolimitsoya	yep - the mount exists. All of them do.
2006-10-20T12:42:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	gizmo_the_great1	did you paste my line?
2006-10-20T12:44:00.000Z	gizmo_the_great1	nolimitsoya	yep - it reported same as b4 : 'wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/hdd5,
2006-10-20T12:45:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	gizmo_the_great1	mount all drives in order, and se if they have switched name to hdc, or something
2006-10-20T12:45:00.000Z	gizmo_the_great1	nolimitsoya	I checked that already. They all the same and correspond to the mount points. how do I run fsck on the unmounted drives?
2006-10-20T12:47:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	gizmo_the_great1	have you checked you drives s.m.a.r.t status, to make sure you havnt got a drive failure on your hands?
2006-10-20T12:49:00.000Z	gizmo_the_great1	nolimitsoya	no - how do I do that?
2006-10-20T12:50:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	gizmo_the_great1	there are tools on the manufacturers webpage
2006-10-20T12:50:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	gizmo_the_great1	by the way, is the drive identityed correctly at bios level?
