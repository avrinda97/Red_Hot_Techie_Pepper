2006-10-14T08:09:00.000Z	zoidberg		guys so it turns out that my friend deleted the whole /log folder in the var directory...so i cant touch it....any help...xserver wont start coz is missing the xorg.0.log file...what canwe do?
2006-10-14T08:11:00.000Z	tritium	zoidberg	create the /var/log folder, then.  Then, try "sudo invoke-rc.d gdm restart".  I don't think he's got to create /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2006-10-26T08:45:00.000Z	tritium	zoidberg	just like any other
2006-10-26T08:45:00.000Z	zoidberg	tritium	how?
2006-10-26T08:45:00.000Z	tritium	zoidberg	are you trying to do dual-head setup, or what?
2006-10-26T08:47:00.000Z	zoidberg	tritium	well that would be nice...like an extended desktop but if i could get it to work with just one external montior without the laptop monitor that would be fine too
2006-10-26T08:47:00.000Z	tritium	zoidberg	what video chip does yoru laptop have?
2006-10-26T08:48:00.000Z	zoidberg	tritium	btw its a powerpc g3 powerbook...old...and i'm running badger on it...works better
2006-10-26T08:48:00.000Z	tritium	zoidberg	oh, okay.  ati?
2006-10-26T08:49:00.000Z	zoidberg	tritium	yes
2006-10-26T08:49:00.000Z	tritium	zoidberg	you can setup dual-head without xinerama too.  "man radeon" for details on what options you need
2006-10-26T08:52:00.000Z	zoidberg	tritium	the video card i have is not radeon...its ATI 3drage pro
2006-10-26T08:53:00.000Z	tritium	zoidberg	yes, but if you use the "ati" driver for X.org, you can use radeon options
2006-10-26T09:00:00.000Z	zoidberg	tritium	I dont want to fuck with my xorg.conf file really....is there any other option?
2006-10-26T09:00:00.000Z	tritium	zoidberg	dude, watch your language please!
2006-10-26T09:01:00.000Z	tritium	zoidberg	you can simply plug in an external monitor and try hot-switching.  You can also "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" once you've done so.
2006-10-26T09:01:00.000Z	zoidberg	tritium	sorry....what do u mean by hotswitching...would i have to reboot?
2006-10-26T09:02:00.000Z	tritium	zoidberg	I don't have an iBook, but it should have a hotkey combination for switching between LCD and external display
