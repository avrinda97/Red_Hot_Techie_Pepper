2010-08-11T13:45:00.000Z	hunterm	brijithmac	i'm looking, be patient :)
2010-08-11T13:46:00.000Z	brijithmac	hunterm	Ok :)
2010-08-11T13:46:00.000Z	hunterm	brijithmac	are you positively sure you have notify-send (libnotify-bin) installed?
2010-08-11T13:48:00.000Z	hunterm	brijithmac	and, you want this to run, at boot time?
2010-08-11T13:48:00.000Z	hunterm	brijithmac	notify-send will not work at boot. X isn't started yet, which means notify-send has no where to go.
2010-08-11T13:48:00.000Z	hunterm	brijithmac	i suggest just running it at login
2010-08-11T13:56:00.000Z	brijithmac	hunterm	oky.. can you tell me how to add a script to run at login tile

2010-08-11T13:57:00.000Z	brijithmac	hunterm	I want to do this through a shell script
2010-08-11T13:57:00.000Z	hunterm	brijithmac	first, chmod +x the script
2010-08-11T13:58:00.000Z	hunterm	brijithmac	then, System>Prefrences>Startup Applications>Add; Command = /path/to/script
