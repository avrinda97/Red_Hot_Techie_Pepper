2007-11-15T11:45:00.000Z	rbrevoort		but it worked
2007-11-15T11:45:00.000Z	rbrevoort		no doesn't
2007-11-15T11:46:00.000Z	echosa	rbrevoort	cdm10: I just used that command and it worked flawlessly
2007-11-15T11:48:00.000Z	echosa	rbrevoort	good, now run that command from before, that wasn't working, should work now
2007-11-15T11:50:00.000Z	rbrevoort	echosa	the command still doesn't work?
2007-11-15T11:51:00.000Z	echosa	rbrevoort	try watching a DVD then, you might not need to run that command... make sure you close totem and reopen it if it is open now
2007-11-15T11:51:00.000Z	echosa	rbrevoort	if that doesn't work, I'm out of ideas, I've never used linux to watch dvds so I have little to no experience in the matter
2007-11-15T11:53:00.000Z	rbrevoort	echosa	totem want a plugin.
2007-11-15T11:53:00.000Z	echosa	rbrevoort	then I'm out of ideas... maybe look around on google for the answer, or look at totem's man page.. it might say something about it
2007-11-15T11:57:00.000Z	echosa	rbrevoort	perhaps this will get you started: https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/totem/+question/11297
