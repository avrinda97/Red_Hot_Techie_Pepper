2010-10-04T05:50:00.000Z	MooshiMuushi	tank8465	That's the link to the thread I made.
2010-10-04T05:52:00.000Z	tank8465	MooshiMuushi	I'm guessing your router/firewall is set at 223.0.0.1, and your wireless AP is set at 223.0.0.2? if that's the case, then theres a collision going on with your IP addresses. manually set a static IP address on the ps3
2010-10-04T05:53:00.000Z	MooshiMuushi		The PS3's IP address is set to 223.0.0.2
2010-10-04T05:53:00.000Z	MooshiMuushi	tank8465	The PS3's IP address is set to 223.0.0.2
2010-10-04T05:53:00.000Z	tank8465	MooshiMuushi	yep, it's colliding with your wireless access point, those usually take an IP address one spot above the default gateway
2010-10-04T05:54:00.000Z	tank8465		change it to 223.0.0.3 or 4 or what have you
2010-10-04T05:54:00.000Z	tank8465		mooshimuushi: just not .1 or .2
2010-10-04T05:54:00.000Z	tank8465		mooshimuushi or whatever your computer or any other devices on your network are set to
2010-10-04T05:54:00.000Z	MooshiMuushi	tank8465	When I restart the computer. The wireless will still not work.
2010-10-04T05:55:00.000Z	MooshiMuushi	tank8465	Hmm, Ok. Changed it to 192.168.1.10 (PS3)
2010-10-04T05:55:00.000Z	MooshiMuushi	tank8465	192.168.1.9 (PC).
2010-10-04T05:55:00.000Z	tank8465		mooshimuushi: see if that works, if not, then idk.
2010-10-04T05:56:00.000Z	tank8465		and make sure your default gateway/subnet masks/dns is set right
2010-10-04T05:56:00.000Z	MooshiMuushi	tank8465	Ok then. Thanks tank8465 :)
