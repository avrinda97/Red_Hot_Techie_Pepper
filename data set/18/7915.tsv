2008-05-24T18:19:00.000Z	Rockj		Hi, im having an Intel HD audio card, why does applications steal the audio input/output's? I need to kill the running application who uses the sound before I can use it in another application. If im going to watch a video on youtube, I have to kill amarok first and restart all applications. Its QUITE annoying..
2008-05-24T18:20:00.000Z	Rockj		I've searched and readed that maybe alsa had some fix for this? like running an alsa daemon to solve multiple sound output?
2008-05-24T18:20:00.000Z	[swb]	Rockj	click preferences in the gnome meny
2008-05-24T18:22:00.000Z	Rockj	[swb]	sound capture is set to   ALSA.  ESD sound mixing is ticked.  default mixer is HDA Intel which probably got bad drivers after what I read on the internet
2008-05-24T18:23:00.000Z	[swb]	Rockj	try setting play back to ESD first
2008-05-24T18:24:00.000Z	Rockj	[swb]	now im playing music in amarok, and the test button is working. let me try if it works with firefox..but I havent changed anything..
2008-05-24T18:24:00.000Z	Rockj	[swb]	no sound output from firefox when amarok or something else got the soundinput.
2008-05-24T18:25:00.000Z	[swb]	Rockj	I think perhaps the flash plugin for firefox has its own set of sound sharing issues
2008-05-24T18:26:00.000Z	Rockj	[swb]	you say something there. let me apt-get xmms too.
2008-05-24T18:29:00.000Z	Rockj	[swb]	sorry for slow response, trying to figure out how xmms2 works.. heh..
2008-05-24T18:30:00.000Z	[swb]	Rockj	Steve-cal sounds like he knows more than me anyway
2008-05-24T18:30:00.000Z	Rockj	[swb]	Ill just try playing with two different sources first - incase it is the flash plugin...
2008-05-24T18:32:00.000Z	Rockj	[swb]	 mhm, I had to kill amarok first before audacious could play the file . so probably I have to reroute so application doesnt talk directtly to output device.
2008-05-24T18:34:00.000Z	Rockj	[swb]	now it works. I edited amarok to specify alsa as output and not autodetect. so now both amarok and audacious is playing music. trying with firefox now :)
2008-05-24T18:35:00.000Z	Rockj	[swb]	im stuck with firefox, since flash plugin is not able to configure output device :(
2008-05-24T18:36:00.000Z	[swb]	Rockj	did you set also as output for all type of playback in the configurator thing?
2008-05-24T18:38:00.000Z	Rockj	[swb]	and Steve-cal : forcing all output to alsa in system-preferences does the trick :-)
2008-05-24T18:39:00.000Z	[swb]	Rockj	glad to hear it :)
