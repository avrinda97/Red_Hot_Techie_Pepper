2008-04-29T18:21:00.000Z	knifepoint		Has anyone got any tips or tricks to get the ati cards actually working with OpenGl in Hardy?
2008-04-29T18:22:00.000Z	cleaton	knifepoint	i like envyng
2008-04-29T18:23:00.000Z	knifepoint	cleaton	I've envyed, I've installed from the ati .run, I've used restricted, i was thinking about reverting to the open source drivers but the Graphics is no there anymore how do i change video device
2008-04-29T18:24:00.000Z	knifepoint	cleaton	sorry that didnt make much sense. How do i change the video driver as the graphics option in the systems menu is not there in hardy
2008-04-29T18:26:00.000Z	cleaton	knifepoint	envyng is a program to install the nvidia, or ati drivers that they have on their sites for linux
2008-04-29T18:26:00.000Z	knifepoint	cleaton	lol yep used it (envyng-gtk) and it didnt work
2008-04-29T18:26:00.000Z	cleaton	knifepoint	you still have the white screen?
2008-04-29T18:27:00.000Z	knifepoint	cleaton	yep :(
2008-04-29T18:27:00.000Z	cleaton	knifepoint	have you tried disableing compiz?
2008-04-29T18:28:00.000Z	knifepoint	cleaton	yep... that works. But um doesn't help the underlying problem.
2008-04-29T18:29:00.000Z	cleaton	knifepoint	you don't have any problem when you have turned off compiz?
2008-04-29T18:29:00.000Z	knifepoint	cleaton	other than the OpenGl being handled by Mesa... no problems.
2008-04-29T18:31:00.000Z	cleaton	knifepoint	go to System -> Administration -> Hardware drivers,  and see if you are using a ati driver there
2008-04-29T18:32:00.000Z	knifepoint	cleaton	yeah fglrx driver is running the ati control panel shows that its finding my card and 2d support is fine just when i go to run a 3d app it gives up
2008-04-29T18:33:00.000Z	cleaton	knifepoint	have you tried glxgears, aiglxgears and glxinfo?
2008-04-29T18:34:00.000Z	knifepoint	cleaton	glxgears gets about 1299 frames ill check the other two now
2008-04-29T18:35:00.000Z	cleaton	knifepoint	glxgears is opengl so pengl is working
2008-04-29T18:36:00.000Z	knifepoint	cleaton	yeah its working with the generic mesa drivers not fglrx mesa isnt good enough to handle compiz... or much at that
