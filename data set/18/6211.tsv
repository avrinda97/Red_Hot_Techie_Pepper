2008-06-17T18:17:00.000Z	s0ullight		no one interested in my problem?
2008-06-17T18:17:00.000Z	gordonjcp	s0ullight	what's the problem?
2008-06-17T18:20:00.000Z	s0ullight	gordonjcp	i have a laptop with a webcam wich was working then i installed motion through the package manager and it started the app immediately and i was root now normal apps like amsn can't open my webcam
2008-06-17T18:22:00.000Z	gordonjcp	s0ullight	sounds like the app is still running - check that motion isn't running in the background
2008-06-17T18:22:00.000Z	s0ullight		killed it :D
2008-06-17T18:22:00.000Z	gordonjcp	s0ullight	and you still can't use the webcam with amsn?
2008-06-17T18:22:00.000Z	s0ullight		no black view
2008-06-17T18:22:00.000Z	gordonjcp	s0ullight	oh, and regarding xmms - use audacious ;-)
2008-06-17T18:23:00.000Z	gordonjcp	s0ullight	perhaps it's still got hold of it, maybe there's a lock file or something
2008-06-17T18:23:00.000Z	s0ullight		i'm using amarok
2008-06-17T18:23:00.000Z	s0ullight		lock file?
2008-06-17T18:23:00.000Z	gordonjcp	s0ullight	open a console, and start amsn from there
