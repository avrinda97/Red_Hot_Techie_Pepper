2010-08-26T09:08:00.000Z	salted		hey guys
2010-08-26T09:08:00.000Z	salted		maybe someone can help me with installing ubuntu?
2010-08-26T09:09:00.000Z	salted		so I've never used linux before and I thought I would try installing it on an external hard drive tonight. I do the install, reboot and choose to boot from the external hard drive. I get the error "File not found" and then I get some kind of grub recovery prompt. Also its a brand new hard drive.
2010-08-26T09:09:00.000Z	salted		I choose the option to use the entire drive in the install
2010-08-26T09:10:00.000Z	Blue1	salted	how did you format the drive, or take the default?
2010-08-26T09:10:00.000Z	Blue1	salted	prolly defaulted to ext4
2010-08-26T09:11:00.000Z	Blue1	salted	please prepend message for me, with my nic, thanks.
2010-08-26T09:11:00.000Z	salted	Blue1	okay, sure
2010-08-26T09:11:00.000Z	Blue1	salted	thanks - what kind of drive, usb external?
2010-08-26T09:12:00.000Z	salted	Blue1	yeah, its a usb external drive
2010-08-26T09:12:00.000Z	salted	Blue1	its brand new so the drive shouldn't be a problem I hope
2010-08-26T09:12:00.000Z	Blue1	salted	what error are you getting on boot? -- I have had new drives that were doa, so newness is im-material
2010-08-26T09:13:00.000Z	salted	Blue1	I think it said, File not found and then a grub recovery prompt shows up
2010-08-26T09:13:00.000Z	salted	Blue1	I've done the install twice now
2010-08-26T09:13:00.000Z	salted	Blue1	same error both times
2010-08-26T09:14:00.000Z	salted	Blue1	yeah, the internal drive boots fine, if I don't choose the bootup drive in the bios startup it goes to the internal one with no questions and boots windows
2010-08-26T09:15:00.000Z	Blue1	salted	try doing a sudo blkid and pastebin the results - Ihave to leave atm - family emergency - but thune3 should be able to help you.
