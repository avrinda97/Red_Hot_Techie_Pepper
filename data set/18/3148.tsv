2009-11-30T11:39:00.000Z	jiga123123		And the question is still: i read somewhere that it is a safer bet to make something like 1 parttttn for system of linux, and 1 partitin for "home" folder. is that true? how does it worK?
2009-11-30T11:40:00.000Z	jiga123123		hey, guys, it's cool that this is a ubuntu channel and you say that I shouldn't use the fs that comes in the package, i will definitely switch to ext3 when i can))
2009-11-30T11:41:00.000Z	jiga123123		billiard: that was really my initial question. How helpful is that? any other trick of that kind? cause I found that whenever i installed something wrond in ubuntu and xubuntu, only the reinstall+format helped to go back :((
2009-11-30T11:43:00.000Z	maco	jiga123123	for my family's computers, i use ext4 on / for speed and ext3 on /home for safety (my own computer is all ext4, but then i carry install discs everywhere)
2009-11-30T11:43:00.000Z	maco	jiga123123	(and i have backups)
2009-11-30T11:44:00.000Z	jiga123123	maco	Thanks!
2009-11-30T11:44:00.000Z	jiga123123	maco	what size do you give to '/'?
2009-11-30T11:44:00.000Z	maco	jiga123123	for normal use i had a 10GB / but now i use 15GB since i need space for lots of development tools
2009-11-30T11:50:00.000Z	jiga123123	maco	thnx, 15gb, noted.
2009-11-30T11:51:00.000Z	maco	jiga123123	thats just because if you have a ton of -dbg and -dev and -doc packages installed for development...plus the entirety of texlive...things can get rather full
2009-11-30T12:25:00.000Z	maco	jiga123123	potentially. if its new hardware thts only supported in newer kernels
2009-11-30T12:26:00.000Z	maco	jiga123123	however there are *some* hardware support backports to LTS releases
2009-11-30T12:47:00.000Z	maco	jiga123123	theyre just snapshots of all updates up to a certain point
2009-11-30T12:47:00.000Z	maco	jiga123123	think like a service pack
2009-11-30T13:13:00.000Z	maco	jiga123123	selling technical support contracts and services to OEMs like Dell who want to make sure their hardware works with Ubuntu
2009-11-30T13:13:00.000Z	maco	jiga123123	er, tech support contracts are to users and/or companies who want to do large deployments
2009-11-30T13:15:00.000Z	jiga123123	maco	is that really one and the main thing? i'd think they have some other occupations as well.  how did it start, canonical?
2009-11-30T13:16:00.000Z	maco	jiga123123	can we take this to PM as it's offtopic?
