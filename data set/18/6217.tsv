2008-07-26T13:03:00.000Z	Gnea	sugi	dgen
2008-07-29T01:24:00.000Z	Gnea	sugi	just tell it to use the vesa driver, for now
2008-07-29T01:26:00.000Z	sugi	Gnea	How do I do that? In Screen Resolution?  But wouldn't that messed up my display and dump me to console?
2008-07-29T01:29:00.000Z	Gnea	sugi	not at all
2008-07-29T01:30:00.000Z	Gnea	sugi	vesa is a default driver, it will work with any modern video card
2008-07-29T01:31:00.000Z	sugi	Gnea	What happens if I want Direct Rendering, let's say for Games i want to play in Wine?
2008-07-29T01:33:00.000Z	Gnea	sugi	you're not supposed to drop to the vesa driver until you're about to remove the ati and install the nvidia
2008-07-29T01:35:00.000Z	sugi	Gnea	Should I change to vesa drivers before or after I install the nvidia drivers.  I want to change video cards right now.  So, I don't mind change the drivers.
2008-07-29T01:36:00.000Z	Gnea	sugi	change the driver now, remove the ati, install the nvidia, when then nvidia boots up, install the restricted nvidia driver
2008-07-29T01:37:00.000Z	sugi	Gnea	 Sorry for this stupid question, but how do I change the drivers?  Do I just uncheck it in "Hardware Drivers" in System > Administration?
2008-07-29T01:41:00.000Z	Gnea	sugi	iirc, it's administration->display
2008-07-29T01:41:00.000Z	sugi	Gnea	Thanks
2008-07-29T01:43:00.000Z	sugi	Gnea	8.04 Hard Heron, Does not have the Administration > "Display" anymore....
2008-07-29T01:43:00.000Z	Gnea	sugi	argh... i'm on kubuntu right now too
2008-07-29T01:43:00.000Z	sugi	Gnea	I am under Gnome of Ubuntu 8.04 Hardy...
2008-07-29T01:44:00.000Z	sugi	Gnea	How do you bring up "Display" from the terminal?  It should still be there *installed with Hardy*?
2008-07-29T01:45:00.000Z	Gnea	sugi	just edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
