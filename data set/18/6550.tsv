2008-06-03T17:35:00.000Z	babolat		do Gutsy and Hardy default come with UDF support?
2008-06-03T17:35:00.000Z	babolat		i sit corrected, Slart :)
2008-06-03T17:35:00.000Z	soundray	babolat	do you mean packet writing for CD/DVDs? Yes.
2008-06-03T17:36:00.000Z	babolat	soundray	i mean just the being-able-to-open-the-darn-data-cd capability...
2008-06-03T17:39:00.000Z	babolat	soundray	do you have any idea what could cause a data CD with UDF format to give a "Can't mount 'UDF Volume' "?
2008-06-03T17:40:00.000Z	soundray	babolat	corruption in the worst case. Is udf listed in 'cat /proc/filesystems'?
2008-06-03T17:41:00.000Z	soundray	babolat	well, you definitely have support then
2008-06-03T17:42:00.000Z	babolat	soundray	odd. coz i've just been able to open it on my laptop running vista...
2008-06-03T17:43:00.000Z	soundray	babolat	perhaps it's a UDF with some proprietary extensions (wouldn't put it past MS)
2008-06-03T17:43:00.000Z	soundray	babolat	have you seen the udftools package? Perhaps there's something useful in there...
2008-06-03T17:44:00.000Z	babolat	soundray	oh wait.. say what? pidgin suddenly stopped scrolling
2008-06-03T17:44:00.000Z	soundray	babolat	have you seen the udftools package? Perhaps there's something useful in there...
2008-06-03T17:44:00.000Z	babolat	soundray	the data disk, i burned myself
2008-06-03T17:45:00.000Z	babolat	soundray	i have installed udftools. just dunno what to do with them
2008-06-03T17:45:00.000Z	soundray	babolat	I haven't tried them, but I would look at the file list (dpkg -L udftools) and the docs (/usr/share/doc/udftools)
2008-06-03T17:52:00.000Z	soundray	babolat	the Ubuntu live CD isn't designed for that. With Knoppix you can do it, thanks to the toram option
2008-06-03T17:54:00.000Z	babolat	soundray	i just found out that the fstab line for this particular udf cd is -->/dev/scd0       /media/cdrom0   udf,iso9660 user,noauto,exec 0       0 -->do you see anything wrong in it?
2008-06-03T17:56:00.000Z	soundray	babolat	no, but when you do a 'sudo mount -t udf /dev/scd0 /mnt', those settings will be overridden, anyway.
