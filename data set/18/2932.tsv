2010-03-08T01:34:00.000Z	photocopy		I'm trying to burn a DVD iso, and brasero just seems to halt on "Preparing to write" this time, and last time it gave me an unknown error... what's going on here?
2010-03-08T01:36:00.000Z	photocopy		losher/iosher will k3b run like crap because its a kde app or no?
2010-03-08T01:38:00.000Z	Losha	photocopy	you won't notice the difference, because most of the time goes in doing i/o to the burner, which is the same whatever application you choose. The biggest downside to running k3b is the install loads a lot of libraries but unless you're short of disk space, you won't notice that either...
2010-03-08T01:39:00.000Z	Losha	photocopy	good luck...
2010-03-08T01:47:00.000Z	photocopy	Losha	again, ive opened up the Burn Image part of k3b and it says "Please insert an empty DVD or Blu-Ray medium"
2010-03-08T01:47:00.000Z	Losha	photocopy	that's weird, sounds like a hardware issue. Reboot the system, making sure it powers off so you get a full hardware reset...
2010-03-08T01:47:00.000Z	photocopy	Losha	okay, and just so I know what to try after, if it does the same thing still, then what?
2010-03-08T01:48:00.000Z	Losha	photocopy	then I guess we try using CLI commands to see if your hardware is responding correctly. Worse case, your burner is kaput...
2010-03-08T01:53:00.000Z	photocopy	Losha	it detects the DVD properly. Its offering me write speeds of 2.4x 4x 6x 8x, auto, ignore, or custom. I was told I was supposed to burn this image at 2x... when i manually set it to 2x it shows auto in the speed box. Do you know if this means it will burn at 2x or will it burn it fast?
2010-03-08T01:54:00.000Z	Losha	photocopy	well that's progress. Choose the closest 2.4X. The main difference is that slower speed burns have fewer errors on them, that's all....
2010-03-08T01:55:00.000Z	photocopy	Losha	okay, fair enough, I just wanted 2x cause that is what they said, the type of media needs to be burned reeeeeeally well
2010-03-08T01:57:00.000Z	Losha	photocopy	sometimes k3b hangs during verification, depending on the version. Let me know...
2010-03-08T02:32:00.000Z	Losha	photocopy	I'm here...
2010-03-08T02:34:00.000Z	Losha	photocopy	you can check the integrity of the burn by running md5sum - < /dev/sr0 and comparing it to the md5sum from the iso file
2010-03-08T02:35:00.000Z	photocopy	Losha	Yeah but there could have been issues with the download or the file itself, theres no way I can tell until I get the thing running the disc. thanks a ton though! im out now.
2010-03-08T02:35:00.000Z	Losha	photocopy	ok, good luck
2010-03-08T02:36:00.000Z	Losha	photocopy	a good download site will post md5sums so you can check against the original....
2010-03-08T22:25:00.000Z	photocopy	Losha	you here?
