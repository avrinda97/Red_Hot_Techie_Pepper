2006-12-18T15:44:00.000Z	opteek	sushi_	: we dont call it IRC anymore
2006-12-18T15:46:00.000Z	sushi_	opteek	did you make a backup of your /etc   ?
2006-12-18T15:46:00.000Z	opteek	sushi_	no , why would I
2006-12-18T15:46:00.000Z	sushi_	opteek	/etc is where all your configuration files are stored.....
2006-12-18T15:47:00.000Z	opteek	sushi_	so if tar my whole /etc and reinstall my system and then untar it, everything will work fine?
2006-12-18T15:48:00.000Z	sushi_	opteek	no you should have backed it up earlier =\
2006-12-18T15:48:00.000Z	opteek	sushi_	right, I will back it up now, and then reinstall lol
2006-12-18T15:49:00.000Z	sushi_	opteek	but youor current configuration is crashing X =\
2006-12-18T15:49:00.000Z	opteek	sushi_	no, i believe corrupt font files are crashing x :)
2006-12-18T15:50:00.000Z	opteek	sushi_	so if thats the case, a fresh install will overwrite those and it should work, right?
2006-12-18T15:50:00.000Z	sushi_	opteek	ok fresh install, but backup your personal files first.
2006-12-18T15:51:00.000Z	opteek	sushi_	if I choose not to format the filesystems, can't I leave everything else intact?
