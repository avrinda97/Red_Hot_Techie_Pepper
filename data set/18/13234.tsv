2007-02-15T10:13:00.000Z	blazemonger		does anyone have accxess to better rage 128 drivers than the ones that came with ubuntu
2007-02-15T10:14:00.000Z	blazemonger		should i try to build a new kernel?
2007-02-15T10:15:00.000Z	blazemonger		since obviously it seems like a kernel problem
2007-02-15T10:15:00.000Z	blazemonger		if all of these packages won't run
2007-02-15T10:15:00.000Z	blazemonger		flightgear wont even work in ubuntu
2007-02-15T10:15:00.000Z	blazemonger		it's like windows is faster than linux
2007-02-15T10:16:00.000Z	Dr_willis	blazemonger	 you using the fglrx drivers or the ati drivers?
2007-02-15T10:17:00.000Z	Dr_willis	blazemonger	 icky. so the fglrx drivers dont work eh.
2007-02-15T10:18:00.000Z	Dr_willis	blazemonger	 reach back.. and smack him hard.
2007-02-15T10:18:00.000Z	Dr_willis	blazemonger	 whats that supposed to accompilsh? not much i am guessing
2007-02-15T10:19:00.000Z	Dr_willis	blazemonger	 you got the windows mentality going. :)
2007-02-15T10:19:00.000Z	Dr_willis	blazemonger	 looking for magic answers.
2007-02-15T10:20:00.000Z	Dr_willis	blazemonger	 you are bascially 'guessing' at this arent you...
2007-02-15T10:20:00.000Z	blazemonger	Dr_willis	yah..since thyere's no official answers and i've filed bug reports on all the packages that wont run
2007-02-15T10:21:00.000Z	Dr_willis	blazemonger	 i would like to see proof of that statement also..   but since ive gotten rid of my ati cards.. good luck.
2007-02-15T10:22:00.000Z	Dr_willis	blazemonger	 prove it, trouble shoot it.. make it repeatable.. then file a bug report.. it never crashes on me.. so it may be PEBKAC
2007-02-15T10:39:00.000Z	Dr_willis	blazemonger	 i have plenty of programs that work for me on it.
2007-02-15T10:43:00.000Z	Dr_willis	blazemonger	 i bet you scared them big time.
