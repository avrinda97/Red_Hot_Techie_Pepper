2010-10-18T21:44:00.000Z	Phrosty		there should definitely be a way to automount certain devices
2010-10-18T21:45:00.000Z	Phrosty		not sure what startup disc creator is... on my parents computer i run the OS off a livecd
2010-10-18T21:45:00.000Z	Phrosty		i'm running ubuntu now but i'm probably gonna go back to linux mint soon (probably debian version)
2010-10-18T21:46:00.000Z	Phrosty		oh def
2010-10-18T21:46:00.000Z	Phrosty		take a look at gconf and see if there's anything out of place
2010-10-18T21:46:00.000Z	Phrosty		go back to sugar and turn it off?
2010-10-18T21:47:00.000Z	Phrosty		how did you get into sugar in the first place?
2010-10-18T21:49:00.000Z	Phrosty		no linux mint debian edition is my favorite currently
2010-10-18T21:49:00.000Z	Phrosty		it has all the features of linux mint with the speed and efficiency of debian
2010-10-18T21:49:00.000Z	Phrosty		also since it's testing the repos are very new
2010-10-18T21:49:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Phrosty	and the base is probably better, since its based on Debian directly not through Ubuntu
2010-10-18T21:50:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Phrosty	no not experimental, newish though, yes
2010-10-18T21:50:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Phrosty	if it was still in development versions only, then it would be experimental, but  the final first version has been out a little while now
2010-10-18T21:51:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Phrosty	I was giong to vm it, but haven't yet
2010-10-18T21:52:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Phrosty	yeah and that might become the main version eventually, since quite a few distros stopped being based on Ubuntu, to be based on Debian directly instead
2010-10-18T21:53:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Phrosty	crunchbang based on Debian now
2010-10-18T21:55:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Phrosty	however yeah  easy way to install propritary drivers can be very useful
2010-10-18T21:55:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Phrosty	yep
