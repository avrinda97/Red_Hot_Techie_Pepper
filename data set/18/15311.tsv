2005-04-13T05:56:00.000Z	sunnywind		any ideas ?
2005-04-13T05:56:00.000Z	karim	sunnywind	ssh tunneling
2005-04-13T05:56:00.000Z	karim		ssh -R
2005-04-13T05:57:00.000Z	karim		you can make appear your ssh port on an other host like if it's is own localport
2005-04-13T05:57:00.000Z	sunnywind	karim	via putty ? that guy have windows machine
2005-04-13T05:57:00.000Z	karim		lol
2005-04-13T05:57:00.000Z	karim		hum
2005-04-13T05:57:00.000Z	karim	sunnywind	I have heard that some windows ssh client can do that
2005-04-13T05:57:00.000Z	karim		but cygwin can do that for sure
2005-04-13T05:58:00.000Z	karim	sunnywind	well in fact the pc on windows needs a ssh server, and cygwin have that
2005-04-13T05:58:00.000Z	karim		good luck
2005-04-13T05:59:00.000Z	sunnywind	karim	he don't want to install all cygwin
2005-04-13T05:59:00.000Z	karim		he don't have to install all cygwin
2005-04-13T05:59:00.000Z	karim		can't he choose just the necessary ?
2005-04-13T05:59:00.000Z	sunnywind		i'm looking for simple solution with vncconnect, but thanks a lot for yours :)
2005-04-13T06:00:00.000Z	karim	sunnywind	there is NO other ways if you are behind a nat
