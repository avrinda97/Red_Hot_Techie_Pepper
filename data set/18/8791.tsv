2007-06-23T06:58:00.000Z	gdb		Is anyone here able to run xterm on their systems?
2007-06-23T06:58:00.000Z	drwx----1-	gdb	i'm running xterm RIGHT NOW
2007-06-23T06:58:00.000Z	gdb	drwx----1-	And your release, which is it?
2007-06-23T06:59:00.000Z	drwx----1-	gdb	Feisty Faun
2007-06-23T06:59:00.000Z	gdb	drwx----1-	Ah, ok.  I'm not able to run xterm on either of 2 dapper systems.  One is my home machine and has some software installed from Universe/Multiverse, the other is at work and has nothing not in Main installed.
2007-06-23T06:59:00.000Z	drwx----1-	gdb	xterm runs on everything
2007-06-23T06:59:00.000Z	gdb	drwx----1-	I'm wondering if I'm alone in this issue or if I should file a bug report.
2007-06-23T06:59:00.000Z	gdb	drwx----1-	Apparently it does not.
2007-06-23T07:00:00.000Z	drwx----1-	gdb	if xterm doesn't run, what does run on your desktop then?
2007-06-23T07:00:00.000Z	gdb	drwx----1-	Everything else. ;-)  I'm using gnome-terminal at the moment.
2007-06-23T07:01:00.000Z	drwx----1-	gdb	have you tried rxvt ?  do you have 234232322432 gnome-terminals running?  maybe you ran out of ttys?  did you try a different window manager like KDE or fluxbox ?
2007-06-23T07:11:00.000Z	drwx----1-	gdb	i think you have fonts installed on your local machine, that are not installed on your remote machine
2007-06-23T07:11:00.000Z	gdb	drwx----1-	xterm is being run on the local machine in both cases
2007-06-23T07:14:00.000Z	drwx----1-	gdb	try this
2007-06-23T07:14:00.000Z	drwx----1-	gdb	sudo dpkg -i --force-confmiss /var/cache/apt/archives/x11-common_*.deb
2007-06-23T07:15:00.000Z	gdb	drwx----1-	thanks, liet me try that
2007-06-23T07:19:00.000Z	drwx----1-	gdb	did that command work?  i was knocked off the net for a bit
2007-06-23T07:22:00.000Z	gdb	drwx----1-	It did reinstall x11-common, but the issue persists.
