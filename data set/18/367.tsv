2012-03-18T17:52:00.000Z	MestreLion	mrfunk	this is not a wine or ubuntu issue
2012-03-18T17:53:00.000Z	MestreLion	mrfunk	ports are opened in your router
2012-03-18T17:53:00.000Z	mrfunk	MestreLion	i dont have a router, i have a modem
2012-03-18T17:53:00.000Z	MestreLion	mrfunk	are you using any firewall?
2012-03-18T17:53:00.000Z	mrfunk	MestreLion	i used to have a router then i changed to a modem because of this, i used to be able to host games with this same modem
2012-03-18T17:53:00.000Z	mrfunk	MestreLion	not that i know of
2012-03-18T17:55:00.000Z	MestreLion	mrfunk	google for "Shields Up" website... there you can find if your ports are opened, closed of stealth
2012-03-18T17:57:00.000Z	MestreLion	mrfunk	run a "all ports" test just to see if you're firewalled or not
2012-03-18T17:58:00.000Z	mrfunk	MestreLion	what does it mean when they are stealth?
2012-03-18T17:59:00.000Z	MestreLion	mrfunk	if all (or most) of your ports < 1050 are stealth, it means you are firewalled
2012-03-18T18:00:00.000Z	mrfunk	MestreLion	how can i find out which firewall is causing this?
2012-03-18T18:00:00.000Z	MestreLion	mrfunk	maybe you have ufw installed... how would I know? :P
2012-03-18T18:03:00.000Z	mrfunk	MestreLion	okay this is weird i just disabled the ufw and now they are all closed except two of them
2012-03-18T18:06:00.000Z	mrfunk	MestreLion	yea, im sorry i thought i had disabled it before, although it doesnt work yet, sames as before
2012-03-18T18:07:00.000Z	MestreLion	mrfunk	stealth means your firewall was "cloaking" them... now they are closed because no software is actually using/opening those ports... open your game and test the port it uses... it should be Open
2012-03-18T18:08:00.000Z	mrfunk	MestreLion	i just did, nobody could join the game i hosted, this is driving me crazy it used to work perfectly
2012-03-18T18:10:00.000Z	mrfunk	MestreLion	okay okay, it worked now, thank you very much for helping me out man, im sorry for this stupid mistake, have a very nice day :)
2012-03-18T18:11:00.000Z	MestreLion	mrfunk	I'm glad it worked, but... it's not over yet
