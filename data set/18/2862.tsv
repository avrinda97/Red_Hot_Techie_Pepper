2010-03-10T00:34:00.000Z	campee		my ubuntu 9.04 machine keeps having problems with the window borders in gnome. i use my computer for like 30-60 minutes and all of a sudden the minimize, maximize, close buttons disappear and my window border turns into a solid gray bar with no text. has anyone else encountered this? anyone have any suggestions on what i can do to make it stop happening or a suggestion on a log file that might point to the cause?
2010-03-10T00:36:00.000Z	campee		i'm looking at top right now and nautilus is using 99% CPU :(
2010-03-10T00:36:00.000Z	campee		help?
2010-03-10T00:36:00.000Z	philien	campee	: Restart
2010-03-10T00:36:00.000Z	campee		i know that if i kill it Xorg will start using 99% CPU. and if i kill that my desktop environment will restart and i'll have to log back in
2010-03-10T00:37:00.000Z	campee	philien	i've already restarted like 4 times and it keeps coming back :/
2010-03-10T00:37:00.000Z	campee		this seems to have started after some recent updates
2010-03-10T00:38:00.000Z	philien	campee	: did you try to reinstall nautilus' packages
2010-03-10T00:38:00.000Z	campee		how do you do that? apt-get uninstall nautilus?
2010-03-10T00:39:00.000Z	philien	campee	: sudo apt-get remove nautilus; sudo apt-get install nautilus
2010-03-10T00:40:00.000Z	campee		i'll try it out. thanks
2010-03-10T00:42:00.000Z	campee		ok, re-installed nautilus. let's see how long it takes before it happens again.
2010-03-10T00:45:00.000Z	campee		does Nautilus have a log file?
2010-03-10T00:45:00.000Z	campee		or does it log to a particular file?
2010-03-10T00:47:00.000Z	philien	campee	: have you done the reinstalation ?
2010-03-10T00:47:00.000Z	campee	philien	yes, i just did it. and i killed Xorg off and it restarted my desktop. and now here i am.. hoping that it doesn't happen again
2010-03-10T00:47:00.000Z	campee	philien	do you know if Nautilus has a log file that I can look at to determine why this might be happening?
2010-03-10T00:48:00.000Z	philien	campee	: I don't know
