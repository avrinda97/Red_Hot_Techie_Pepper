2009-11-08T17:22:00.000Z	Munim	belal_	if you have a capable graphics card, you need to get the drivers for it. either the manufacturer's proprietry drivers or any open source alternatives
2009-11-08T17:24:00.000Z	Munim	belal_	go ahead. just ask
2009-11-08T17:26:00.000Z	Munim	belal_	that's because the xwindows has not loaded. its only showing the shell
2009-11-08T17:26:00.000Z	Munim	belal_	i think startx will start it.
2009-11-08T17:26:00.000Z	Munim	belal_	but it probably hasn't started because it faced some errors
2009-11-08T17:32:00.000Z	Munim	belal_	empathy has voice chat i guess
2009-11-08T17:33:00.000Z	Munim	belal_	you can use google talk voice chat in empathy.
2009-11-08T17:34:00.000Z	Munim	belal_	just start empathy and put in your google talk login details.. its simple
2009-11-08T17:35:00.000Z	Munim	belal_	i am not too sure about video chat.
2009-11-08T17:35:00.000Z	Munim	belal_	yeah it works on skype
2009-11-08T17:36:00.000Z	Munim	belal_	ubuntu recognizes quite a few webcams.. give it a shot
2009-11-08T17:40:00.000Z	Munim	belal_	i think you need to register for a voip account somewhere.
