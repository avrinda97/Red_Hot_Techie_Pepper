2008-11-05T06:00:00.000Z	morph3us		hi.. i am trying to install the new ubuntu but i am getting this error.. http://www.flickr.com/photos/jr/3003476569/   any clue?
2008-11-05T06:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	morph3us	did you md5 check the cd?
2008-11-05T06:01:00.000Z	morph3us	ActionParsnip	how can i do that?
2008-11-05T06:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	morph3us	i bet you have a bad disk
2008-11-05T06:02:00.000Z	morph3us	ActionParsnip	i have burned 2 different CD's from 2 different isos, downloaded from different servers
2008-11-05T06:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	morph3us	doesnt matter, use the md5 sum on the same server to check the iso you burned and then use the program on the cd to check the cd for defects
2008-11-05T06:03:00.000Z	morph3us	ActionParsnip	i will do that, thank u :)
2008-11-05T06:43:00.000Z	morph3us	ActionParsnip	r u there?
2008-11-05T06:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	morph3us	sup
2008-11-05T06:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	morph3us	ok then boot to the cd and check it theer too
2008-11-05T06:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	morph3us	if its ok, check the ram for issues
2008-11-05T06:46:00.000Z	morph3us	ActionParsnip	actually i am using Archlinux.. i can't even make the CD test.. i got right away the "Error reading boot CD"
2008-11-05T06:47:00.000Z	morph3us	ActionParsnip	this could be related with the fact i am using an ATI card?
2010-06-13T07:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	morph3us	when it drops run: dmesg | tail
2010-06-13T07:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	morph3us	you may also want to reboot and run:  dmesg | less     to see if a firmware file was expected
2010-06-13T07:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	morph3us	dmesg shows the kernel messages since boot
2010-06-13T07:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	morph3us	if you find something then i'd log a bug to make it known as well as the fix you get (if any)
2010-06-13T08:10:00.000Z	morph3us	ActionParsnip	may i talk to u in private?
