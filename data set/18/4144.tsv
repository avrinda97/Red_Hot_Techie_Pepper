2009-07-01T17:04:00.000Z	indus		could someone please tell me about the new xorg.conf file and all that automatically generated stuff since hardy
2009-07-01T17:04:00.000Z	indus		xorg.conf being auto generated on startup
2009-07-01T17:05:00.000Z	Titan8990_	indus	no its not, it actually doesn't use rely on xorg.conf anymore
2009-07-01T17:05:00.000Z	Titan8990_	indus	since the release of xorg 1.5 that is all handled by the HAL daemon on the fly
2009-07-01T17:06:00.000Z	Titan8990_	indus	what ActionParsnip1 gave was simply a TUI for generating a xorg.conf
2009-07-01T17:06:00.000Z	Titan8990_	indus	hald configuration is terrible, stick to xorg.conf that you are used to but just keep in mind that thats no longer required
2009-07-01T17:07:00.000Z	indus	Titan8990_	i remember the command used to configure monitors , etc refresh rates but now seems to end at select keyboard and mouse
2009-07-01T17:07:00.000Z	Titan8990_	indus	you really shouldn't need to edit resolutions or refresh rates anymore but feel free
2009-07-01T17:08:00.000Z	indus	Titan8990_	well i never did but just curious how things have changed
2009-07-01T17:08:00.000Z	indus	Titan8990_	but i also remember a screens and graphics option in hardy which seems to have been removed again from jaunty
2009-07-01T17:22:00.000Z	Titan8990_	indus	I think what you want is to make a dir: ~/scripts and then add it your $PATH
2009-07-01T17:30:00.000Z	Titan8990_	indus	no its not
2009-07-01T17:30:00.000Z	indus	Titan8990_	well ok
2009-07-01T17:32:00.000Z	indus	Titan8990_	why do a dist-upgrade
2009-07-01T17:34:00.000Z	Titan8990_	indus	dist-upgrade doesn't mean that it upgrades to a new version, however it is used as such in debian
2009-07-01T17:34:00.000Z	indus	Titan8990_	ok now thats something new i hear, are you sure of this
2009-07-01T17:34:00.000Z	Titan8990_	indus	man apt-get
