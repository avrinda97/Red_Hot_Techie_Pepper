2007-02-06T10:44:00.000Z	Quintin	Crescendo	You still haven't said what your issue is.
2007-02-06T10:47:00.000Z	Quintin	Crescendo	Odd.  I would ask in #gnome.  have you tried using sshfs instead of the GNOME connection?  1) there are several WYSIWYG editors for linux.  nvu is one that comes to mind.  2) WYSIWYG is for idiots IMNSHO.  I do everything from scratch with vi 3) dreamweaver runs with WINE compatibility layer.
2007-02-06T10:49:00.000Z	Crescendo	Quintin	I use DW for the coding shtuff.  And, while I am a geek, I don't like this "linux crap" - vi, nano - zomg, use this tool, no use this one.  But anyways.  Yeah, it's just too much of a hassle (for me) to get a copy (!) and wine it.
2007-02-06T10:50:00.000Z	Quintin	Crescendo	Get a copy of what, WINE?  It's free.  apt-get install wine.  boom, done.  As long as you do it all from scratch and don't use the GUI bull :P.  I tried a demo of dw for 1h or so and hated it, but it may be useful :)
2007-02-06T10:52:00.000Z	Crescendo	Quintin	nah - a copy of DW.  :P   The only thing that it provides over Gedit + Nautilus + SSH is tag completion, library lookups for languages I'm working with, and FTP instead of SSH.
2007-02-06T10:52:00.000Z	Quintin	Crescendo	Wait, if you aren't currently using and thus dependent on functionality in DW, why are you complaining about it?
2007-02-06T10:55:00.000Z	Crescendo	Quintin	just ranting.  If I had tab completion in Gedit, I wouldn't worry about it. :)
2007-02-06T10:56:00.000Z	Quintin	Crescendo	What changes?
2007-02-06T10:57:00.000Z	Crescendo	Quintin	this keepalive crap.
2007-02-06T10:57:00.000Z	Quintin	Crescendo	Ehm.  It works quite well.
2007-02-06T10:58:00.000Z	Crescendo	Quintin	sure - I agree.  The technical merit of Linux is great.
2007-02-06T11:02:00.000Z	Quintin	Crescendo	I somewhat agree.  I don't think ubuntu users are forced to do such.  When they are the documention is very *very* specific about what to do.  SSH works great for me
2007-02-06T11:03:00.000Z	Crescendo	Quintin	sure, and that's all well and dandy.  Problem is, users _don't_ reat documentation
2007-02-06T11:03:00.000Z	Quintin	Crescendo	Ubuntu is not for that person at the present time.
2007-02-06T11:03:00.000Z	Crescendo	Quintin	true
2007-02-06T11:03:00.000Z	Crescendo	Quintin	we're gearing for that direction, though.
2007-02-06T11:04:00.000Z	Quintin	Crescendo	Rome wasn't built in a day.
