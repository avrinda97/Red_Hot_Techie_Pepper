2007-07-22T05:23:00.000Z	Tidus	Lattyware	sudo gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf and change "nv" in the video driver section to "nvidia"
2007-07-22T05:23:00.000Z	Lattyware	Tidus	I said, I am using the nvidia drivers. That's not it.
2007-07-22T05:23:00.000Z	Tidus	Lattyware	just because the nvidia drivers are installed doesn't mean xorg.conf gets updated automatically
2007-07-22T05:23:00.000Z	Lattyware	Tidus	I know, but xorg is right.
2007-07-22T05:23:00.000Z	Lattyware	Tidus	I edited it myself.
2007-07-22T05:25:00.000Z	Tidus	Lattyware	have you checked to make sure the option to load glx is uncommented in xorg.conf, as well as leaving dri *COMMENTED*
2007-07-22T05:25:00.000Z	Lattyware	Tidus	Yes, definatly.
2007-07-22T05:28:00.000Z	Tidus	Lattyware	lemme find my xorg.conf and it'll show you how i had my system set up with an nvidia running a monitor + tv as well as an old ati card for a second monitor...
2007-07-22T05:31:00.000Z	Tidus	Lattyware	there's part of the problem.  too many device sections.  only need one per head
2007-07-22T05:31:00.000Z	Lattyware	Tidus	Yes, it appears to have created more devices.
2007-07-22T05:33:00.000Z	Tidus	Lattyware	take twinview out of the monitor's options as well
2007-07-22T05:46:00.000Z	Tidus	Lattyware	welcome back
2007-07-22T05:46:00.000Z	Lattyware	Tidus	Hey.
2007-07-22T05:46:00.000Z	Tidus	Lattyware	here's my xorg.conf for you.  http://tidus.alive-awake.com/config/xorg.conf
2007-07-22T05:46:00.000Z	Tidus	Lattyware	nvidia card powering monitor and tv out, secondary ati card for second monitor
2007-07-22T05:48:00.000Z	Lattyware	Tidus	Yeah, I can't see anything you have done that I havn't that would effect it...
