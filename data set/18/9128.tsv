2007-05-05T14:13:00.000Z	HKJGN_		ATIs drivers destroyed my resolution, how can i fix this?
2007-05-05T14:14:00.000Z	ziroday	HKJGN_	what gfx card?
2007-05-05T14:14:00.000Z	HKJGN_	ziroday	X800gt
2007-05-05T14:14:00.000Z	HKJGN_	ziroday	i used Envy to install the ATI drivers cause they werent compatible with X 7.2.0
2007-05-05T14:15:00.000Z	HKJGN_	ziroday	but it just trashed my Gnome-XGL session, im on regular Gnome session right now
2007-05-05T14:15:00.000Z	ziroday	HKJGN_	whats the max resolution you can get?
2007-05-05T14:15:00.000Z	HKJGN_	ziroday	no idea, uhm 12xx X 800
2007-05-05T14:16:00.000Z	ziroday	HKJGN_	did you get the proper resolution before installing the ati frivers?
2007-05-05T14:16:00.000Z	HKJGN_	ziroday	Envy changed my X.org automatically
2007-05-05T14:16:00.000Z	HKJGN_	ziroday	so i guess not
2007-05-05T14:17:00.000Z	ziroday	HKJGN_	so what exactly is the issue resolution or something else?
2007-05-05T14:18:00.000Z	HKJGN_	ziroday	i'd guess resolution, the screens all, well, distorted and etc, lines going across the screen and nothing is readable
2007-05-05T14:18:00.000Z	HKJGN_	ziroday	like when you set a resolution the monitor cant handle
2007-05-05T14:19:00.000Z	ziroday	HKJGN_	um rite if its resolution then you have to add the resolution to your xorg do you know how to do that?
2007-05-05T14:19:00.000Z	HKJGN_	ziroday	yeah
2007-05-05T14:19:00.000Z	ziroday	HKJGN_	have you done it yet?
2007-05-05T14:20:00.000Z	HKJGN_	ziroday	not yet, i think i might know how to fix it, just have to ask a question, if i change my resolution in one Session, will it stay the same in another session? "Gnome to Gnome with XGL?"
2007-05-05T14:21:00.000Z	ziroday	HKJGN_	i think for all
