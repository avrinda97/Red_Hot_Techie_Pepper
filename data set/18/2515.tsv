2010-04-30T18:40:00.000Z	digitzer		Hi! I use Ubuntu 64 bit 10.04. I installed  flashplugin-nonfree from sysnaptic. Firefox (no-plug-in installed yet) can not open flash and opera does not working fine with flash (I mean opera can open the flash but the buttons not working with it.) . I re-install (with --purge) opera, firefox and  flashplugin-nonfree but the same problem still. My system is updated. Can someone tell me please something to solve the problem ?
2010-04-30T18:40:00.000Z	tarzeau	digitzer	tried with chromium-browser yet?
2010-04-30T18:42:00.000Z	digitzer	tarzeau	Im sorry but i have to use opera or firefox :( (it is personal reason :( )
2010-04-30T18:42:00.000Z	tarzeau	digitzer	can you figure where you flashplayer.so is, and run file on it? is it really 64-bit?
2010-04-30T18:43:00.000Z	tarzeau	digitzer	and are you sure you didn't install it as firefox user into your home config directory?
2010-04-30T18:44:00.000Z	digitzer	tarzeau	i dont know what are you talking about. i just use synaptic to install flashplugin-nonfree . I did not do anything else. If you can make me give you a input from terminal, i can. or please explain me easly ... (i am not a good linux user)
2010-04-30T18:45:00.000Z	tarzeau	digitzer	dpkg -L flashplugin-nonfree |grep so
2010-04-30T18:45:00.000Z	digitzer	tarzeau	I write it on terminal it gives nothing...
2010-04-30T18:46:00.000Z	tarzeau	digitzer	i think it's because of the installer meta package
2010-04-30T18:46:00.000Z	digitzer	tarzeau	so ?
2010-04-30T18:46:00.000Z	tarzeau	digitzer	i think it's in /usr/lib/flashplugin-nonfree
2010-04-30T18:46:00.000Z	digitzer	tarzeau	so ? :)
2010-04-30T18:46:00.000Z	tarzeau	digitzer	try copying the plugin to where firefox or opera expects it
2010-04-30T18:46:00.000Z	tarzeau	digitzer	so as in shared object (library file)
2010-04-30T18:46:00.000Z	digitzer	tarzeau	 ok please wait...
2010-04-30T18:46:00.000Z	tarzeau	digitzer	the meta package or the browser/plugin packages don't work properly all times
2010-04-30T19:00:00.000Z	digitzer	tarzeau	I download the beta of 64 bit adobe flash . I copy the libflashplayer.so file to /home/mozilla/plug-in . flash works fine now with firefox. But even i have delete from synaptic the flash i did not udnerstand how flash works now with opera too ?
2010-04-30T19:00:00.000Z	tarzeau	digitzer	copy the file you got to the right opera place, no idea where that is. i don't like opera
