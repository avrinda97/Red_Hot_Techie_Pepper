2007-10-19T15:55:00.000Z	choudesh		This is going to be a fun day, its 7am and I am upgrading from dapper to gutsy. :-D
2007-10-19T15:55:00.000Z	cwill1	choudesh	ha
2007-10-19T15:55:00.000Z	cwill1	choudesh	sure you don't want to wait for hardy?
2007-10-19T15:55:00.000Z	cwill1	choudesh	I'd imagine they'll make that upgrade (lts to lts) easier
2007-10-19T15:56:00.000Z	choudesh	cwill1	nah - this in on my dedicated test box.
2007-10-19T15:56:00.000Z	choudesh	cwill1	on my actual server I hope they do that.
2007-10-19T15:56:00.000Z	cwill1	choudesh	I did it a few days ago, wasn't too bad actually
2007-10-19T15:57:00.000Z	cwill1	choudesh	 just slow going confirming customized /etc's
2007-10-19T15:57:00.000Z	choudesh	cwill1	Well, I don't have phyiscal access to this box - plus no internet-accessable reboots
2007-10-19T15:57:00.000Z	cwill1	choudesh	uhhhhhh :p
2007-10-19T15:57:00.000Z	cwill1	choudesh	good luck with that :)
2007-10-19T15:58:00.000Z	choudesh	cwill1	I am praying.
2007-10-19T15:58:00.000Z	cwill1	choudesh	I'd also suggest starting an extra sshd on a different port, and keep a root prompt open on that
2007-10-19T15:58:00.000Z	cwill1	choudesh	that way you don't get killed when the pam update restarted /etc/init.d/gdm
2007-10-19T15:58:00.000Z	cwill1	choudesh	oh, and make sure you run it from a screen session
2007-10-19T15:59:00.000Z	cwill1	choudesh	apt-get doesn't like it when the session disappears because of a dropped connection :)
2007-10-19T15:59:00.000Z	choudesh	cwill1	good idea. though it still needs to reboot.
2007-10-19T15:59:00.000Z	cwill1	choudesh	yes, but if you lose your connection during the upgrade, you're screwed :)
