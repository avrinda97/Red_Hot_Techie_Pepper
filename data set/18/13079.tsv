2007-04-23T15:30:00.000Z	shirish		guys is there some software that I can change wallpapers every x minutes from art.gnome.org ?
2007-04-23T15:30:00.000Z	velko	shirish	yes. look at www.gnomefiles.org. they are several
2007-04-23T15:31:00.000Z	shirish	velko	what I'm saying is I want an automated tool kinda thing, is there something like that?
2007-04-23T15:32:00.000Z	velko	shirish	take a look at this site. i have seen several such applications. never tried any of them so i can't recommend any
2007-04-23T15:34:00.000Z	shirish	velko	I have seen that site several times, I have tried gnome-art quite a bit but it doesn't fit my bill as of yet
2007-04-23T15:35:00.000Z	velko	shirish	i'm not speaking about gnome-art but about www.gnomefiles.org. you need a sleep perhaps?
2007-04-23T15:39:00.000Z	shirish	velko	saw it fully, the only program which comes close to what I want (lifting wallpapers) from art.gnome.org is done only by art manager or Gnome-Art
2007-04-23T15:39:00.000Z	shirish	velko	I didn't find any other application which does that
2007-04-24T13:36:00.000Z	velko	shirish	this is not an error. it just shows the fragmentation level of the file system
2007-04-24T13:36:00.000Z	velko	shirish	nothing to worry about
2007-04-24T13:37:00.000Z	shirish	velko	ok cool, but why it should show as failed for fdisk ? and I have seen it happens I think every boot or every 2nd boot, is that normal?
2007-04-24T13:38:00.000Z	velko	shirish	failing is another story. it's not related to the fragmentation level at all
2007-04-24T13:38:00.000Z	velko	shirish	and no. it's not normal
2007-04-24T13:42:00.000Z	shirish	velko	if fdisk failing is not normal, what should I do about that?
2007-04-24T13:42:00.000Z	velko	shirish	is this your root file system?
2007-04-24T13:50:00.000Z	shirish	velko	sorry been also trouble-shooting some other stuff as well, yes this is my root file system
2007-04-24T13:52:00.000Z	velko	shirish	ok. so it's best to boot the life cd and check the file system from it. the default behaviour -A is not that efficient.
2007-04-24T13:54:00.000Z	velko	shirish	i suspect that you get the error because it simply doesn't gets repaired on boot
