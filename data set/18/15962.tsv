2005-12-25T09:30:00.000Z	thu		Are there any differences between running Ubuntu 32bit on a 32bit CPU and running Ubuntu 32bit on a AMD64 CPU?
2005-12-25T09:30:00.000Z	Ng	thu	nope
2005-12-25T09:30:00.000Z	thu	Ng	Are you sure?
2005-12-25T09:31:00.000Z	Ng	thu	if you run the 32bit (ie i386) version you are 100% compatible with a regular pentium type system
2005-12-25T09:31:00.000Z	thu	Ng	Nothing special so far?
2005-12-25T09:32:00.000Z	Ng	thu	nothing special ever, it's completely identical - the amd64/emt64 CPUs have the full 32bit instruction set available
2005-12-25T09:33:00.000Z	thu	Ng	then, the bug I have been struggled with for one week must be caused by gcc version
2005-12-25T09:33:00.000Z	Ng	thu	why ar eyou using gcc4? that's not in breezy afaik
2005-12-25T09:33:00.000Z	Ng	thu	what are you trying to compile?
2005-12-25T09:33:00.000Z	thu	Ng	coz if I type apt-get install gcc, the default version is 4.0

2005-12-25T09:34:00.000Z	thu	Ng	I wanna run 0.9.9 ;-)
2005-12-25T09:38:00.000Z	thu	Ng	How can I uninstall the gcc related packages I have just installed completely??
2005-12-25T09:38:00.000Z	Ng	thu	sudo apt-get remove --purge gcc-4.0
2005-12-25T09:38:00.000Z	Ng	thu	and any other packages you want to completely remove
2005-12-25T09:39:00.000Z	thu	Ng	I just hope to remove the packages I installed when i type apt-get install gcc
