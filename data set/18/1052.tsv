2011-12-29T17:15:00.000Z	L1nuxRules		xfce atint the best desktop to use if you need to ask those questions though
2011-12-29T17:15:00.000Z	L1nuxRules		wasnt saying best as in the best was saying its not user friendly like gnome
2011-12-29T17:16:00.000Z	L1nuxRules		ActionTurnip maybe
2011-12-29T17:18:00.000Z	L1nuxRules		I would say xfce is the best to go for the way the other DE are going though, have never liked kde
2011-12-29T17:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	L1nuxRules	I like LXDE personally, no nonsense
2011-12-29T17:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	L1nuxRules	there are plenty of DEs to go at, more than XFCE, KDE and Gnome
2011-12-29T17:22:00.000Z	L1nuxRules	ActionParsnip	yeah Ive usually used tty1 for most things though apart from if a gui is needed :)
2011-12-29T17:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	L1nuxRules	similar, I just use guake
2011-12-29T17:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	L1nuxRules	it's EOL at the same time as Oneiric...
2011-12-29T17:46:00.000Z	L1nuxRules	ActionParsnip	so all the packages on an LTs are the same as the latest?
2011-12-29T17:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	L1nuxRules	will be slightly different, Oneiric will have later stuff
2011-12-29T17:47:00.000Z	L1nuxRules	ActionParsnip	As I come from Red Hat based I see LTS as CentOs and the latest as Fedora but only ever used LTS
2011-12-29T17:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	L1nuxRules	i see
2011-12-29T18:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	L1nuxRules	its dead upstream, there may be forks like 'mate'
2011-12-29T18:08:00.000Z	L1nuxRules	ActionParsnip	I c
2011-12-29T20:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	L1nuxRules	swap is also needed for hibernate / suspend reasons
2011-12-29T20:25:00.000Z	L1nuxRules	ActionParsnip	I forgot all about them because never used them.
2011-12-29T20:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	L1nuxRules	its still exists and is desirable for others, so swap can be needed
