2010-11-01T15:24:00.000Z	Licuadora		I reallly don't want to reinstall Ubuntu all over again. I deleted the NetworkManager because it stoped working - I had a red signal on the icon -
2010-11-01T15:24:00.000Z	Licuadora		Now I do not have any internet in my PC
2010-11-01T15:25:00.000Z	Licuadora		Is there a way to make Ubuntu recongnize my PCI wifi card again?
2010-11-01T15:27:00.000Z	Licuadora		There is some ping option, but that never works
