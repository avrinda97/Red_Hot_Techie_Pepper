2005-10-25T09:27:00.000Z	carthik	bigfoot1	not much to be done about that
2005-10-25T09:28:00.000Z	bigfoot1	carthik	what do you mean?
2005-10-25T09:28:00.000Z	carthik	bigfoot1	if you get a segmentation fault then that is too bad, but there is not much that can done about the app itself - it was not meant to be used by the public
2005-10-25T09:29:00.000Z	bigfoot1	carthik	i understand.
2005-10-25T09:29:00.000Z	bigfoot1	carthik	so it is in repos for developers?
2005-10-25T09:29:00.000Z	bigfoot1	carthik	do you use it?
2005-10-25T09:29:00.000Z	carthik	bigfoot1	don't use it :)
2005-10-25T09:30:00.000Z	bigfoot1	carthik	you don't use it? or are you telling me not to use it?
2005-10-25T09:30:00.000Z	carthik	bigfoot1	both, actually
2005-10-25T09:31:00.000Z	carthik	bigfoot1	i tried it once, took pictures and sent it on its way to its rightful place
2005-10-25T09:31:00.000Z	bigfoot1	carthik	what would be the best gnome app that does what quicksilver does on gnome.
