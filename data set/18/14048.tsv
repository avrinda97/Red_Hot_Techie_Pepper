2005-09-20T07:27:00.000Z	IceDragon		Somthing like stardock?
2005-09-20T07:27:00.000Z	alek	IceDragon	most window managers for linux contain their own theme system.
2005-09-20T07:31:00.000Z	alek	IceDragon	you need to be more specific...
2005-09-20T07:31:00.000Z	alek	IceDragon	there are many window managers, all of which look differently and act differently.
2005-09-20T07:32:00.000Z	alek	IceDragon	it's not like windows, where you change the way it looks...a window manager runs on top of Xorg and that denotes the way it looks
2005-09-20T07:32:00.000Z	alek	IceDragon	do some research on the differences between Gnome and KDE, they are two very different window managers
2005-09-20T07:33:00.000Z	alek	IceDragon	Xorg is the "windows" of linux
2005-09-20T07:34:00.000Z	alek	IceDragon	do you have ubuntu installed?
2005-09-20T07:34:00.000Z	alek	IceDragon	try themes at freshmeat
2005-09-20T07:34:00.000Z	IceDragon	alek	yes
2005-09-20T07:35:00.000Z	alek	IceDragon	yeah check out the gnome themes, the default brown is kinda boring, but the glory of window managers in linux are that you can change the look completely, but it still functions the same.
2005-09-20T07:39:00.000Z	alek	IceDragon	there is a guide for starting on linux...specifically ubuntu..check out http://ubuntuguide.org, but be aware it's not updated for breezy
2005-09-20T08:01:00.000Z	alek	IceDragon	have you read the manual yet?
2005-09-20T08:01:00.000Z	alek	IceDragon	cuz you ask the weirdest vaguest questions
2005-09-20T08:02:00.000Z	alek	IceDragon	try ubuntulinux.com
2005-09-20T08:10:00.000Z	alek	IceDragon	it's because you aren't running apt-get as root
2005-09-20T08:10:00.000Z	alek	IceDragon	i suggest you read the FAQ
