2011-05-07T14:32:00.000Z	mang0		Guys, I installed Ubuntu a couple of days ago, to dual boot winxp and ubuntu 11.04, running on seperate drives. I unplugged my win drive when I was installing ubuntu so I didn't accidentally wipe it (they are identical drives) and now I don't get the option to boot windows or ubuntu, only windows. To boot ubuntu I have to unplug the windows drive...help!

2011-05-07T14:34:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mang0	Can you just change the boot order in the BIOS?
2011-05-07T14:35:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mang0	You can install grub to both drives, but then Windows won't boot without the Ubuntu drive connected (which may be fine depending on what you want).
2011-05-07T14:36:00.000Z	mang0	Jordan_U	In an ideal situation, both drives are connected and when I boot I can pick ubuntu or windows.
2011-05-07T14:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mang0	Can you boot Ubuntu once with the Windows drive plugged in by guessing a few times?
2011-05-07T14:38:00.000Z	mang0	Jordan_U	I've been trying to do it without avail for 20mins heh
2011-05-07T14:40:00.000Z	mang0	Jordan_U	in ubuntu i refreshed grub etc, and it saw the winxp stuff...
2011-05-08T14:29:00.000Z	Jordan_U	mang0	I think you have the wrong nick.
2011-05-08T14:29:00.000Z	mang0	Jordan_U	how so?! :P
