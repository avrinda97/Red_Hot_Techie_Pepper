2007-11-03T06:45:00.000Z	c0mp13371331337	hipitihop	Basically it depends on what graphics card you're using, what driver, and the combined resolution of both monitors.
2007-11-03T06:45:00.000Z	c0mp13371331337	hipitihop	What is the total virtual display area for both your monitors?
2007-11-03T06:46:00.000Z	hipitihop	c0mp13371331337	nvidia 7 series on a Acer aspire 5630 lcd is 1280x800 and external lcd panel is 1280x1024
2007-11-03T06:47:00.000Z	hipitihop	c0mp13371331337	as for total virtual area, I'm not sure, how can I tell ?
2007-11-03T06:48:00.000Z	c0mp13371331337	hipitihop	At least you have nvidia on your side.  I'm not as familiar with nvidia as I am with ATI, but it should be possible.  Total virtual area = (x resolution + x resolution)x(y resolution + y resolution)
2007-11-03T06:49:00.000Z	hipitihop	c0mp13371331337	just to be clear, if I disable the extended monitor, the effects etc all work fine so the nividia driver and all that seems to work fine
2007-11-03T06:50:00.000Z	c0mp13371331337	hipitihop	Well that's a good sign.  Do you have dual monitors working WITHOUT compiz at all?
2007-11-03T06:51:00.000Z	hipitihop	c0mp13371331337	yes sort off, although it is difficult to get the resolutions set correctly for both simultaneously... i.e. either external is correct or laptop iis correct
2007-11-03T06:56:00.000Z	c0mp13371331337	hipitihop	Yeah, I luckily haven't had to deal with two different resolution monitors, both of mine are same resolution.  I've heard that when you do get it working, the smaller resolution one actually scrolls around, so the resolution is actually the same for each monitor, but because the viewport is smaller on one of them, when you move the mouse around, the viewport of the smaller monitor 'scrolls' around.  Anyway, to answer yo
2007-11-03T07:06:00.000Z	hipitihop	c0mp13371331337	any chance you can help with my other problem regarding "Authentication failure" while trying to upgrade another machine to Gutsy ?
2007-11-03T06:59:00.000Z	hipitihop	c0mp13371331337	yes I understand, although my problem  seems the other way around i.e. the higher capability scrolls around if the lower laptop one is set right or if the higher capable monitor is set correctly then the laptop seems to step down in rez and not pan around
2007-11-03T07:01:00.000Z	c0mp13371331337	hipitihop	Huh, that's odd.  Unfortunately, as I said, I'm no nvidia master, I've got an ATI myself (pronounced 'masochist' when running linux....) so I'm not familiar with the TwinView options.  And I'm pretty sure MergedFB is strictly an ATI thing.  So can't help you there, boss, sorry!
2007-11-03T07:02:00.000Z	hipitihop	c0mp13371331337	so any suggestions regarding getting compiz going with both monitors
2007-11-03T07:07:00.000Z	c0mp13371331337	hipitihop	Authentication Failure, eh?  I work in tech support, and my first response to authentication failure is: "Do you have caps lock or num lock on, sir?" ;-)
2007-11-03T07:09:00.000Z	hipitihop	c0mp13371331337	hehe.. ok thanks for your time anyway
2007-11-03T07:10:00.000Z	c0mp13371331337	hipitihop	 No problem, sorry I couldn't help.
