2005-09-14T15:01:00.000Z	sepmike		anyone have experience with ESD and mplayer or xmms?
2005-09-14T15:03:00.000Z	sepmike		i tried esound in xmms and it said check... error
2005-09-14T15:03:00.000Z	sepmike		i'll try mplayer conf
2005-09-14T15:05:00.000Z	sepmike		mplayer.conf can't be found
2005-09-14T15:06:00.000Z	mgedmin	sepmike	create a file ~/.mplayer/config that contains 'ao = esd'
2005-09-14T15:07:00.000Z	mgedmin	sepmike	you might also want to tell mplayer to use the xv video driver that supports hardware video scaling -- to do so add 'vo = xv' to .mplayer/config
2005-09-14T15:10:00.000Z	sepmike		I chaned the config but it's still looking for asla
2005-09-14T15:10:00.000Z	sepmike		in the available drivers section in gmplayer it doesnt even have the option of ESD\
2005-09-14T15:12:00.000Z	mgedmin	sepmike	run 'mplayer -ao help' in a console -- it will list all available audio drivers
2005-09-14T15:12:00.000Z	mgedmin		if it doesn't mention esd, then you have a problem
2005-09-14T15:13:00.000Z	sepmike	mgedmin	ESD is not listed when I type what you wrote
2005-09-14T15:13:00.000Z	mgedmin	sepmike	did you compile mplayer from source, or did you install a deb from somewhere?
2005-09-14T15:14:00.000Z	sepmike		source from the tut on the ubuntuforums.org site
2005-09-14T15:15:00.000Z	mgedmin	sepmike	then it means you didn't have the necessary headers/libraryes to compile in esd support
2005-09-14T15:15:00.000Z	mgedmin	sepmike	I use mplayer-586 deb which came from marillat's repository, iirc
2005-09-14T15:15:00.000Z	sepmike		ahh
2005-09-14T15:15:00.000Z	sepmike		well I wonder if there is away to uninstall this one I did from source?
2005-09-14T15:33:00.000Z	sepmike	mgedmin	thanks got it working now
