2005-12-28T15:27:00.000Z	tonyyarusso		VNC question: Can you give someone the ability to browse your system, but not do anything potentially destructive, just to see what stuff's like?
2005-12-28T15:28:00.000Z	skon	tonyyarusso	just don't check the option that says "allow someone to control my com[puter"
2005-12-28T16:02:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	skon	The partitioner in the Ubuntu install lets you do that stuff.
2005-12-28T16:38:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	skon	I think it lets you open a connected utility of ntfsresize.
2005-12-28T16:38:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	skon	Let me check mine.
2005-12-28T16:40:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	skon	Try apt-get install ntfsprogs.
2005-12-28T16:47:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	skon	Which command?
2005-12-28T16:49:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	skon	And the install of ntfsprogs had no problems?  I just did the exact same thing, and I have ntfsresize here.
2005-12-28T16:50:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	skon	Check spelling and such.
2005-12-28T16:51:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	skon	All right.  Whatever works.
2005-12-28T16:52:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	skon	Yeah, once the ntfs is out of the way.
2006-01-08T08:58:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	skon	What about all of the other parts that go with a program?  configurations, libraries, etc?
2006-01-08T08:59:00.000Z	skon	tonyyarusso	configurations probably go in /home/yourName/.programname
2006-01-08T08:59:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	skon	Ah.
2006-01-08T08:59:00.000Z	skon	tonyyarusso	libraries.... I'm guessing /usr/bin/lib
2006-01-08T09:00:00.000Z	skon	tonyyarusso	libraries.... actually /usr/lib
2006-01-08T09:00:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	skon	Right.
