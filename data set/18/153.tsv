2012-07-20T18:35:00.000Z	L3top	dhanasekaran	I don't know how terribly helpful I will be... I use pxe very differently. Perhaps dcullen can be of some assistance.
2012-07-20T18:39:00.000Z	L3top	dhanasekaran	what guide are you following now to get to this point?
2012-07-20T18:40:00.000Z	dhanasekaran	L3top	I am following https://help.ubuntu.com/12.04/installation-guide/amd64/install-tftp.html guide, But not possible to configure local repo.
2012-07-20T18:47:00.000Z	L3top	dhanasekaran	I would do this completely differently. I would change the /etc/apt/sources.list in the boot image... probably mini.iso vs trying to use d-i.
2012-07-20T18:50:00.000Z	dhanasekaran	L3top	I also doing the same thing, All packages getting from internet it's working But, I have not possible all my client machine access internet , loose my all bandwidth, because i am trying for local repo
2012-07-20T18:51:00.000Z	L3top	dhanasekaran	you need to have a Packages.gz file in your local repo, and it must be defined in the sources.list. See dpkg-scanpackages.
2012-07-20T18:52:00.000Z	dhanasekaran	L3top	the package is there my local repo, I cant download using ubuntu installer using d-i
2012-07-20T18:52:00.000Z	L3top	dhanasekaran	again... I wouldn't use d-i
2012-07-20T18:52:00.000Z	dhanasekaran	L3top	I am pressed.cfg file http://paste.ubuntu.com/1101892/
2012-07-20T18:53:00.000Z	dhanasekaran	L3top	please check my config file
2012-07-20T18:53:00.000Z	L3top	dhanasekaran	I have... and THIS is why I don't use d-i
2012-07-20T18:53:00.000Z	L3top	dhanasekaran	well... unless I have to... like on an install cd/dvd
2012-07-20T18:54:00.000Z	dhanasekaran	L3top	ok, Any help for me.. my constrain
