2012-06-15T19:53:00.000Z	schnuffle1	gdane	so your system fails to mount the root partition during boot?
2012-06-15T19:53:00.000Z	schnuffle1	gdane	how did it happen?
2012-06-15T19:58:00.000Z	schnuffle1	gdane	So you cleaned your disk and now it can't be mounted anaymore? Have you tried to boot from live system and mount it there?
2012-06-15T19:59:00.000Z	schnuffle1	gdane	I did, but wasn't really interested in the problem because there's not enough info right now
2012-06-15T20:01:00.000Z	schnuffle1	gdane	then try it to see if the partition is alright
2012-06-15T20:01:00.000Z	schnuffle1	gdane	How did you clean your partition
2012-06-15T20:03:00.000Z	schnuffle1	gdane	So you cleand your hone dir only?
2012-06-15T20:04:00.000Z	schnuffle1	gdane	To check all this boot into a live system and then we can see where the roblem is
