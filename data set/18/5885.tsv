2008-08-06T11:16:00.000Z	FuRom		I installed the XMMS2 package through the synaptic package manager, and I can't seem to access any GUI of it.... I've looked back into the package manager to make sure there isn't a specific GUI package for it, but there doesn't seem to be one, can anyone help me out?
2008-08-06T11:17:00.000Z	joejoecircusboy	FuRom	Use audacious instead
2008-08-06T11:17:00.000Z	FuRom	joejoecircusboy	audacious is a sound editing tool?....
2008-08-06T11:17:00.000Z	joejoecircusboy	FuRom	No, that's Audacity (how could you get those confused? :P)

2008-08-06T11:50:00.000Z	FuRom	joejoecircusboy	ah, I see. lol, thanks anyways ^_^' It's pretty much all I need. I can always put it on a workspace out of the way, if it isn't able to minimize into a system tray icon.
