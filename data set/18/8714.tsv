2007-07-07T08:24:00.000Z	capitanyochua		anyone help me with changing permissions on a mounted device?
2007-07-07T08:25:00.000Z	capitanyochua		Okay. I need to change permissions on a mounted device. Am I doing it properly with chmod?
2007-07-07T08:25:00.000Z	bruenig	capitanyochua	what is the filesystem
2007-07-07T08:26:00.000Z	capitanyochua	bruenig	 trying to change permissions on mounted ipod
2007-07-07T08:26:00.000Z	bruenig	capitanyochua	so fat32 probably?
2007-07-07T08:26:00.000Z	capitanyochua	bruenig	 yes.
2007-07-07T08:26:00.000Z	bruenig	capitanyochua	chmodding a fat32 is pointless because fat32 doesn't retain the permissions
2007-07-07T08:27:00.000Z	bruenig	capitanyochua	you need to mount the entire drive with certain permissions
2007-07-07T08:27:00.000Z	capitanyochua	bruenig	 so what are you suggesting? And how do I go about that?
2007-07-07T08:27:00.000Z	capitanyochua	bruenig	 I can't write into my ipod as user.... I need to change that.
2007-07-07T08:28:00.000Z	bruenig	capitanyochua	that page from ubotu ^^
2007-07-07T08:28:00.000Z	bruenig	capitanyochua	it should be mounted automatically with correct write permissions
2007-07-07T08:28:00.000Z	bruenig	capitanyochua	so if it isn't then you might also have other issues with hal or something else
2007-07-07T08:28:00.000Z	capitanyochua	bruenig	 That's another thing. Plugging the ipod in wouldn't automatically mount. I received some privilege error. So I had to mount manually.
2007-07-07T08:29:00.000Z	bruenig	capitanyochua	hmm I am not to big on hal myself even though I use it, I think it is pretty buggy. Basically go to that ubout link, you are probably going to want to mount the drive with the options fmask=111,dmask=000
2007-07-07T08:30:00.000Z	capitanyochua	bruenig	 what's Hal??
2007-07-07T08:31:00.000Z	bruenig	capitanyochua	hardware abstraction layer, it is sort of the standard thing that automounts drives and such, even though there are many utilities that can do that, all the DEs seem to just use hal so you pretty much have to use it
2007-07-07T08:44:00.000Z	capitanyochua	bruenig	When following instructions on the link you gave me i came across this... http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/28920/plain/
