2006-11-12T08:20:00.000Z	Pelo	Flats	 look in the menu under internet
2006-11-12T08:22:00.000Z	Pelo	Flats	 you might want to check in enable the link in the alacart menu editor
2007-09-22T05:56:00.000Z	Pelo	Flats	I assume you need a dependency ? there is no difference,  and you'll probably be instlling libgtk2.0
2007-09-22T05:56:00.000Z	Pelo	Flats	 install the -dev package
2007-09-22T06:00:00.000Z	Pelo	Flats	do a search for gtk  and you'll probably see something along the line of  libgtk2.0-dev
2007-09-22T06:01:00.000Z	Flats	Pelo	found it dinstalling now, Thanks
2007-09-22T06:18:00.000Z	Pelo	Flats	cli apps don'T show in the menues you need to run them frmo the terminal
2007-10-04T11:32:00.000Z	Pelo	Flats	I think you should look in the forum for an answer to taht quesiton  www.ubuntuforums.org
