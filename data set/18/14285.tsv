2006-11-05T17:02:00.000Z	Yggdrasil		is the only way to get a 2.6.17 kernel under dapper to compile it ?
2006-11-05T17:03:00.000Z	Yggdrasil		hmm..
2006-11-05T17:04:00.000Z	Yggdrasil		is edgy the new ubuntu ?
2006-11-05T17:04:00.000Z	Yggdrasil		ok i will
2006-11-05T17:04:00.000Z	borfast	Yggdrasil	yes, Edgy Eft is Ubuntu 6.10, the latest release
2006-11-05T17:05:00.000Z	Yggdrasil		so just change everything that says dapper to edgy right
2006-11-05T17:06:00.000Z	borfast		does anyone kow of a simple fix for Edgy + IPW220 + WPA2? In Dapper I installed Network Manager and it was working perfectly but now with Edgy (fresh install) I don't have the WPA2 option, only WPA :(
2006-11-05T17:06:00.000Z	Yggdrasil	jordan	huh ? cant i just run edgy ?
2006-11-05T17:07:00.000Z	borfast		ok, forget that, it's working after all :D
2006-11-05T17:08:00.000Z	Yggdrasil	jordan	this is a console only box
2006-11-05T17:08:00.000Z	Yggdrasil		ill change the sources and update and do a dist-upgrade
2006-11-05T17:08:00.000Z	Yggdrasil		ack
