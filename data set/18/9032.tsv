2008-04-25T16:38:00.000Z	nullkuhl		no.. i changed host name by editing /etc/hostname file
2008-04-25T16:38:00.000Z	nullkuhl		ï»¿wild_oscar:i seriously regret waiting and downloading hardy
2008-04-25T16:39:00.000Z	ifireball	nullkuhl	since you changed your /etc/hostname file your /etc/hosts file is probably is probably out of sync with it, which may cause all kinds of trouble
2008-04-25T16:39:00.000Z	nullkuhl	ifireball	yea may be it was my mistake then,, but the graphics problem is killing me
2008-04-25T16:40:00.000Z	nullkuhl	ifireball	i just downloaded the restricted driver then enabled effects,, works exactly for 3 seconds then total system freeze !
2008-04-25T16:41:00.000Z	ifireball	nullkuhl	well, try fixing the /etc/hosts problem first and see what happens (in Linux graphics == networking...)
2008-04-25T16:42:00.000Z	nullkuhl	ifireball	the network problem already fixed i switched back the original hostname
2008-04-25T16:42:00.000Z	ifireball	nullkuhl	total freezes are typically roted in hardware problems though, could your system be overheating?
2008-04-25T16:43:00.000Z	nullkuhl	ifireball	but the system doesnt freeze unless i use the wobble windows effect,,
2008-04-25T16:43:00.000Z	ifireball	nullkuhl	does the system work right without effects? say, using the restricted driver and playing a 3D game?
2008-04-25T16:43:00.000Z	ifireball	nullkuhl	the wobble is one of the more demanding effects afaik
2008-04-25T16:44:00.000Z	nullkuhl		a 3d game ? have none currently
2008-04-25T16:44:00.000Z	nullkuhl	ifireball	works fine without effects !
2008-04-25T16:45:00.000Z	ifireball	nullkuhl	try working a while with the most basic effects setting, see if if freezes after a while (when opening lots of windows or something)
2008-04-25T16:49:00.000Z	nullkuhl	ifireball	either with basic or massive effects when trying to move windows system freezes at once but when trying other effects like fading and minimizing effects works fine
2008-04-25T16:51:00.000Z	ifireball	nullkuhl	sounds like a bug... or a faulty GFX card
2008-04-25T16:51:00.000Z	nullkuhl		hmmm
2008-04-25T16:52:00.000Z	ifireball	nullkuhl	try playing a game with effects off, I don't really know which 3D games are bundled with Ubuntu though, check the Add/Remove applet
