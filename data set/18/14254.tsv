2006-05-12T12:41:00.000Z	mneptok	edison	use sudo, not chmod
2006-05-12T12:41:00.000Z	mneptok	edison	use sudo, not chmod (x2)
2006-05-12T12:45:00.000Z	mneptok	edison	but you should use sudo to install the patch, not change the permissions in order to do it
2006-05-12T12:52:00.000Z	mneptok	edison	one last time. do NOT use chmod. use sudo to install the patch.
2006-05-12T12:54:00.000Z	mneptok	edison	if it's telling you that, you're not using sudo to install the patch
2006-05-12T12:54:00.000Z	mneptok	edison	you can't use su on Ubuntu without sudo.
2006-05-12T12:55:00.000Z	mneptok	edison	then start the game with sudo
2006-05-12T12:57:00.000Z	mneptok	edison	W:ET often has problems as it does not use ALSA
