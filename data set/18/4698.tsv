2009-03-02T09:43:00.000Z	fallore_	Zykotic	i'm afraid i didn't understand the instructions in the pastebin, would you have time to go a little more indepth?
2009-03-02T09:44:00.000Z	fallore_	Zykotic	specifically, do i just paste that [writable] section in there somewhere and tweak it?
2009-03-02T09:44:00.000Z	Zykotic	fallore_	it was a real rough blueprint of what you need to edit...  where you get stuck?
2009-03-02T09:44:00.000Z	Zykotic	fallore_	exactly customize to suite!
2009-03-02T09:44:00.000Z	fallore_	Zykotic	does it not matter where i paste that section?
2009-03-02T09:45:00.000Z	Zykotic	fallore_	there is a section 3/4 the way down i think, look for the printer share...
2009-03-02T09:45:00.000Z	fallore_	Zykotic	do i put it with the printer stuff?
2009-03-02T09:46:00.000Z	Zykotic	fallore_	ya, just after, it really doesn't matter where you put it, it's just convention
2009-03-02T09:46:00.000Z	fallore_	Zykotic	is there an easy way to back up this file so that if i break something i can revert?
2009-03-02T09:46:00.000Z	Zykotic	fallore_	did you notice the separte user=share section?  that's kinda important.
2009-03-02T09:47:00.000Z	Zykotic	fallore_	sudo cp smb.conf smb.conf.origional
2009-03-02T09:47:00.000Z	fallore_	Zykotic	the part below the writable section in the pastebin? i didn't understand what it was.
2009-03-02T09:48:00.000Z	Zykotic	fallore_	look for a line that says "security = user" and change it to "security = share"
2009-03-02T09:49:00.000Z	Zykotic	fallore_	i'm creating something that every version of Windows I know (or samba) can connect too without having to map user account or anything -- there is NO security
2009-03-02T09:49:00.000Z	fallore_	Zykotic	i'm not sure if this is relevant, but it might help. there is already a folder accessible on the network (\\htpc\xbmc (xbmc is the user) that we can connect to. what we want is to have another file, \\htpc\media that is similarly shared. does this change anything?
2009-03-02T09:50:00.000Z	Zykotic	fallore_	ya it kinda changes things... i sec
2009-03-02T09:51:00.000Z	Zykotic	fallore_	that means you already have a working share on this samba box called xbmc?!  so just copy that section again in your smb.conf file and change the name and the path and your golden
