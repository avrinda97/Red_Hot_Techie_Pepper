2012-08-29T08:44:00.000Z	octavio-rdz		I just installed (fresh install) 12.04.1 amd64 and I'm having a lot of  problems some dependency issues, some other like apt-get tells me a something is installed but when I trie to use it the command doesn't exist ... any idea if 12.04.1 was a bad release? I have 12.04 in other computer and I don't have such problems :s, any idea?
2012-08-29T08:46:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	octavio-rdz	if you updated in the other computer you have 12.04.1 there as well, specificities will be your best bet here.
2012-08-29T08:46:00.000Z	wilee-nilee		you're*
2012-08-29T08:47:00.000Z	octavio-rdz	wilee-nilee	yes I know that.. that is why I thought that maybe the 12.04.1 release media had the problem
2012-08-29T08:47:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	octavio-rdz	your question is way to vague.
2012-08-29T08:48:00.000Z	octavio-rdz		I want to know if there are any other having similar problems or if is there any report about 12.04.1 being a bad release
2012-08-29T08:50:00.000Z	octavio-rdz		like I said I had a 12.04 update but (installed from 12.04 release media and I have no problems ... but I do have problems when installing from 12.04.1
2012-08-29T08:51:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	octavio-rdz	So who would be reporting I think you miss the point here.
2012-08-29T08:51:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	octavio-rdz	name the exact problem.
2012-08-29T08:54:00.000Z	octavio-rdz	wilee-nilee	my first problem was with ubuntuone it just crashes with the error No module named PyQt4
2012-08-29T08:56:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	octavio-rdz	Cool that helps a great deal on this channel, I can't really help with that one without looking on google but I will look.
2012-08-29T08:57:00.000Z	octavio-rdz	wilee-nilee	I already installed python-qt4 package but ubuntuone still doesn't work
2012-08-29T09:00:00.000Z	octavio-rdz	wilee-nilee	then I had a problem with aptitude I install it by apt-get but it just doesn't run it says, aptitude: error while loading shared libraries: libcwidget.so.3
2012-08-29T09:00:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	octavio-rdz	aptitude is considered as deprecated, but should work I suppose.
2012-08-29T09:01:00.000Z	octavio-rdz	wilee-nilee	then I had a similar problem with git-svn a dependency problem after installing the package with apt-get .. I have tried use the ubuntu software center and same results
2012-08-29T09:02:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	octavio-rdz	I see various hints at the first error but to be honest I'm not real strong in ethier of your problems.
2012-08-29T09:03:00.000Z	octavio-rdz	wilee-nilee	ok I guess I would have to go back to install 12.04 and update from there ... I haven't had those issues installing from 12.04 media
2012-08-29T09:04:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	octavio-rdz	Could be any number of things going on here, I doubt it is a difference in loads, but you never know.
