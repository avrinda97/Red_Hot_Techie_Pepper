2005-09-30T07:56:00.000Z	clyrrad		Someone please tell me why I can not extract linux-source-2.6.10.tar.bz2, I get (bzip2: Data integrity error when decompressing.)  And the command I am using is sudo tar --bzip2 -xvf linux-2.6.12.tar.bz2
2005-09-30T07:57:00.000Z	zorba64	clyrrad	sounds like it might be corrupted
2005-09-30T07:57:00.000Z	clyrrad	zorba64	I have tried to get it from kernel.org and get the same problem, where can I get it reliably?
2005-09-30T07:58:00.000Z	zorba64	clyrrad	try tar -xjvf ...otherwise, how are you downloading it?
2005-09-30T07:59:00.000Z	zorba64	clyrrad	toss it and redownload
2005-09-30T07:59:00.000Z	clyrrad	zorba64	from where?
2005-09-30T07:59:00.000Z	zorba64	clyrrad	same place...what are you downloading it with?
2005-09-30T07:59:00.000Z	clyrrad	zorba64	I have tried from kernel.org, where else can i get it?
2005-09-30T08:00:00.000Z	clyrrad	zorba64	using wget
2005-09-30T08:01:00.000Z	zorba64	clyrrad	do you have a local mirror of kernel.org?   where are you??
2005-09-30T08:01:00.000Z	clyrrad	zorba64	I used this wget http://kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/linux-2.6.10.tar.bz2
2005-09-30T08:03:00.000Z	zorba64	clyrrad	have a look here http://www.kernel.org/mirrors/...use wget -c ...that continues if you have to stop it for any reason
2005-09-30T08:10:00.000Z	clyrrad	zorba64	I get the exact same errors, even when i downloaded the sources from a Canadian Mirror
2005-09-30T08:11:00.000Z	clyrrad	zorba64	sudo tar --bzip2 -xvf linux-2.6.10.tar.bz2 is what I am trying to use, but no matter what I am not able to decompress the archive
2005-09-30T08:12:00.000Z	zorba64	clyrrad	is bzip2 installed??
2005-09-30T08:13:00.000Z	zorba64	clyrrad	this is weird...somrthing is corrupting you downloads...wont be the mirrors
2005-09-30T08:13:00.000Z	clyrrad	zorba64	what do you think can be the problem?
2005-09-30T08:37:00.000Z	clyrrad	zorba64	I checked the archive on another PC and the archive is not corrupted, just this machine can not uppack it... any idea why that is?
