2007-07-20T10:09:00.000Z	Talcite		hey guys, I can't get my mic working in Ubuntu. ALSA is giving me on hell of a time.
2007-07-20T10:09:00.000Z	Talcite		I've compiled the module, and also installed the one in the repos
2007-07-20T10:10:00.000Z	Talcite		is there any way to make it work?
2007-07-20T10:10:00.000Z	Some_Person	Talcite	is it enabled? is the volume all the way down? make sure
2007-07-20T10:10:00.000Z	Talcite	Some_Person	yup, the basic stuff is all done
2007-07-20T10:10:00.000Z	Talcite	Some_Person	I can't even test the ALSA sound. It gives me that unable to access blah blah error
2007-07-20T10:11:00.000Z	Some_Person	Talcite	so you have no sound?
2007-07-20T10:11:00.000Z	Talcite	Some_Person	I'm using OSS at the moment, but mic is no good
2007-07-20T10:11:00.000Z	Some_Person	Talcite	what is your sound card?
2007-07-20T10:11:00.000Z	Talcite	Some_Person	STAC 9221D
2007-07-20T10:12:00.000Z	Talcite	Some_Person	it's considered under the Intel HDA codec
2007-07-20T10:12:00.000Z	Talcite	Some_Person	but I find that a solution that applies to one doesn't apply to all
2007-07-20T10:14:00.000Z	Some_Person	Talcite	so on alsa, you can't play any sound at all?
2007-07-20T10:14:00.000Z	Talcite	Some_Person	yeah, no sound with ALSA. I had it working on and off, but it's really on and off
2007-07-20T10:17:00.000Z	Some_Person	Talcite	I can't find anything on google, forums, or anywhere with this problem
2007-07-20T10:18:00.000Z	Talcite	Some_Person	yeah, same here =/. Thanks for trying to help though, it was good
2007-07-20T10:19:00.000Z	Some_Person	Talcite	i suggest you find a way to get your microphone just working on oss
2007-07-20T10:20:00.000Z	Talcite	Some_Person	hmm... I'll try heh. Thanks. Oh actually, do you know how to get a usb mic working with linux? for some reason when I recompiled the ALSA drivers, I ended up deleting the USB support =S
