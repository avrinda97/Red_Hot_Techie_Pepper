2011-01-30T16:52:00.000Z	edwardteach	boxbeatsy	your wireless connection keeps cutting out because  your wired connection is interfering at a guess .. what is the out put of cat /etc/network/interfaces
2011-01-30T16:53:00.000Z	boxbeatsy	edwardteach	hmm i see.  it's  auto lo and then iface lo inet loopback
2011-01-30T16:53:00.000Z	boxbeatsy	edwardteach	the odd thing is that my ssh connections and irc connections are staying connected
2011-01-30T16:54:00.000Z	boxbeatsy	edwardteach	it's just the svn updates and the browser page loads are erroring out randomly

2011-01-30T16:58:00.000Z	boxbeatsy	edwardteach	no, it's an internal one
2011-01-30T16:59:00.000Z	boxbeatsy	edwardteach	hmmm weird...my wireless card has been disabled this whole time
