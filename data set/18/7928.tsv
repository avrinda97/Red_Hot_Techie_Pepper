2007-10-25T10:58:00.000Z	pheonixind		You got mythbuntu to work????  Awesome.
2007-10-25T10:59:00.000Z	Excallibur	pheonixind	mythbuntu is totally functional minus the NIC card
2007-10-25T10:59:00.000Z	Excallibur	pheonixind	well, the problem isn't myth, i got that all set
2007-10-25T11:00:00.000Z	Excallibur	pheonixind	the problem is that ubuntu isn't recognizing my NIC
2007-10-25T11:00:00.000Z	pheonixind	Excallibur	What NIC do you have?
2007-10-25T11:00:00.000Z	Excallibur	pheonixind	oh man, its built into the mobo
2007-10-25T11:01:00.000Z	Excallibur	pheonixind	is there anything in the command line that would help me figure that out?
2007-10-25T11:01:00.000Z	Excallibur	pheonixind	i don't think so, i'll double check though
2007-10-25T11:03:00.000Z	Excallibur	pheonixind	no it isn't under the restricted drivers menu
2007-10-25T11:04:00.000Z	pheonixind	Excallibur	The distro may not have a driver for the nic then. =(
2007-10-25T11:04:00.000Z	Excallibur	pheonixind	is it possible to get the driver from somewhere?
2007-10-25T11:05:00.000Z	pheonixind	Excallibur	May be able too.  May have to google it.
2007-10-25T11:05:00.000Z	Excallibur	pheonixind	i have a regular gusty desktop disk here, the nic works with that disk, can i pull it from there somehow?
2007-10-25T11:05:00.000Z	Excallibur	pheonixind	 i'm not sure what to google for
2007-10-25T11:06:00.000Z	pheonixind	Excallibur	You may be able too, but I have never had to do that before so I dont know much about that.
2007-10-25T11:06:00.000Z	Excallibur	pheonixind	well thanks for the advice, i appreciate it
