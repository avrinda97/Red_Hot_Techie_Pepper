2009-01-15T11:12:00.000Z	Frijolie		basic question for someone who's willing to help
2009-01-15T11:12:00.000Z	Frijolie		often times I get a window which is huge and I cannot resize it because it expands beyond my taskbar(s)
2009-01-15T11:12:00.000Z	Frijolie		is there a way to move the window around so it can be resized?
2009-01-15T11:13:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	Frijolie	 Hold ALT and move the Windows around with your mouse.
2009-01-15T11:13:00.000Z	Frijolie		more specifically where I can get to the bottom-right corner of the window
2009-01-15T11:13:00.000Z	Frijolie	jinja-sheep	i'll try that
2009-01-15T11:13:00.000Z	Frijolie	jinja-sheep	well that will let me move it around but the top edge just "bumps" against the bottom edge of my top taskbar
2009-01-15T11:14:00.000Z	Frijolie	jinja-sheep	the bottom-right edge is still below the bottom taskbar
2009-01-15T11:14:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	Frijolie	 You can enable the plugin that'll allow you to resize.
2009-01-15T11:14:00.000Z	Frijolie	jinja-sheep	does this have something to do with Compiz?
2009-01-15T11:14:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	Frijolie	 Let me check.
2009-01-15T11:15:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	Frijolie	 What application is it you're having issue with?
2009-01-15T11:15:00.000Z	Frijolie		Jinja-sheep: it's not one particular application
2009-01-15T11:15:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	Frijolie	 Small resolution? :O
2009-01-15T11:15:00.000Z	Frijolie	jinja-sheep	it happens to numerous applications
2009-01-15T11:15:00.000Z	Frijolie	jinja-sheep	no I'm running 1280x800 resolution
2009-01-15T11:16:00.000Z	Frijolie	jinja-sheep	like right now, I've got a Nautilus window that I need to resize
2009-01-15T11:17:00.000Z	jinja-sheep	Frijolie	 You might want to "sudo aptitude install compizconfig-settings-manager"  -- From there -- Be sure your visual effects are at its max -- And check out the Compiz Setting Manager under System -- Look for a resize plugin that'll let you resize using keyboard and/or mouse.
