2009-12-01T08:36:00.000Z	tauren		I'm trying to install 9.10 server onto a system I've configured using the mobo's built-in Adaptec HW RAID1 to mirror 2 drives.
2009-12-01T08:36:00.000Z	tauren		But when I get to partitioning disks, it tells me no root filesystem and errors out.
2009-12-01T08:37:00.000Z	nemo	tauren	ohhhh
2009-12-01T08:37:00.000Z	nemo	tauren	I know where this is going :D :D
2009-12-01T08:37:00.000Z	nemo	tauren	you know how those mobos claim to have HW raid?
2009-12-01T08:37:00.000Z	nemo	tauren	it is A LIE
2009-12-01T08:37:00.000Z	nemo	tauren	it is basically the RAID equivalent of winmodems :( :(
2009-12-01T08:37:00.000Z	nemo	tauren	if you say so. I have no familiarity apart from fact that several "server class" computers at work have that failing
2009-12-01T08:38:00.000Z	nemo	tauren	ummm. hmmm. I'm still skeptical. but ok :)
2009-12-01T08:38:00.000Z	nemo	tauren	that's my tentative diagnostic
2009-12-01T08:38:00.000Z	nemo	tauren	that's what we ended up doing :D
2009-12-01T08:38:00.000Z	nemo	tauren	hell, if the OS is going to do the heavy lifting *anyway*
2009-12-01T08:38:00.000Z	nemo	tauren	maybe I can find the article I was reading on this. one sec :D
2009-12-01T08:38:00.000Z	tauren	nemo	so what's the best way to get mirroring and lvm set up?
2009-12-01T08:39:00.000Z	nemo	tauren	sorry, machine we setup that way was slack - no ubuntu familiarity on this front
2009-12-01T08:40:00.000Z	nemo	tauren	actually, I'm trying to remember why I stepped into this noisy channel. so many questions
2009-12-01T08:40:00.000Z	tauren	nemo	ok.  i'll try to do software raid first i guess.
2009-12-01T08:45:00.000Z	tauren	nemo	 haha!
