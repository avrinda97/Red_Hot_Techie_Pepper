2008-08-28T19:32:00.000Z	Armored_Azrael		Upon plugging in my usb hard drive, I hear the drive spin up, but no device entry appears
2008-08-28T19:32:00.000Z	ikonia	Armored_Azrael	what does syslog say ?
2008-08-28T19:32:00.000Z	Armored_Azrael	ikonia	onesec, pastebinning
2008-08-28T19:33:00.000Z	ikonia	Armored_Azrael	thats not you syslog
2008-08-28T19:34:00.000Z	Armored_Azrael	ikonia	Yes it is, but here's my syslog via the file...
2008-08-28T19:34:00.000Z	Armored_Azrael	ikonia	http://pastebin.com/m6d88ccae
2008-08-28T19:35:00.000Z	Armored_Azrael	ikonia	I'm pretty sure dmesg just dumps syslog directly.
2008-08-28T19:35:00.000Z	ikonia	Armored_Azrael	dmesg is not the syslog
2008-08-28T19:35:00.000Z	Armored_Azrael	ikonia	OK, well, I gave you the output from syslog as well
2008-08-28T19:35:00.000Z	ikonia	Armored_Azrael	yup, just reading
2008-08-28T19:35:00.000Z	ikonia	Armored_Azrael	hub 6-0:1.0: hub_port_status failed (err = -32)
2008-08-28T19:36:00.000Z	ikonia	Armored_Azrael	have you tried it in a different port
2008-08-28T19:36:00.000Z	ikonia	Armored_Azrael	it looks like the port is locked/resetting
2008-08-28T19:36:00.000Z	Armored_Azrael	ikonia	Yes, I've tried all three ports on my laptop
2008-08-28T19:36:00.000Z	ikonia	Armored_Azrael	do they all preset that error, but with the port address changing ?
2008-08-28T19:38:00.000Z	Armored_Azrael	ikonia	Yes
2008-08-28T19:38:00.000Z	ikonia	Armored_Azrael	looks like either your usb bus is not supported or hung, has it ever worked ?
2008-08-28T19:39:00.000Z	Armored_Azrael	ikonia	My usb has worked, this device has not worked before, just got it.
