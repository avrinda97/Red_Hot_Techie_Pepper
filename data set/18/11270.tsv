2008-03-20T16:52:00.000Z	nicodarious		does anyone have any suggestions on how to flash a BIOS from Linux?
2008-03-20T16:53:00.000Z	nicodarious		I'm trying to update my mobo bios so I can install my new AMD 6400 CPU, but everywhere I go there's either sites telling me "use a floppy", although my machine has none.  Any suggestions?
2008-03-20T16:55:00.000Z	waylandbill	nicodarious	I think you can burn the files to a CD and use the floppy image as the bootable image for the CD. I don't have instructions to do so though.
2008-03-20T16:56:00.000Z	nicodarious	waylandbill	hmm... using a floppy image to make a bootable CD?  interesting..
2008-03-20T16:57:00.000Z	waylandbill	nicodarious	yes. k3b I know can burn that type of disc.
2008-03-20T16:58:00.000Z	nicodarious	waylandbill	do I need the floppy info in order to burn it onto the disc or does k3b already have it in it's system ready?
2008-03-20T16:58:00.000Z	waylandbill	nicodarious	you'll need the floppy yes.
2008-03-20T16:58:00.000Z	waylandbill	nicodarious	the image of it.
2008-03-20T16:59:00.000Z	nicodarious	waylandbill	hmm.. ok.  i'll see what I can find.  thanks!
2008-03-20T17:21:00.000Z	nicodarious	waylandbill	you still here?
2008-03-20T17:22:00.000Z	waylandbill	nicodarious	yes I am
2008-03-20T17:23:00.000Z	nicodarious	waylandbill	wow, there's a lot of kde stuff I have to install just to get k3b installed, heh.  I'm running purely gnome right now, and I hate to install useless programs for just one.  you know of any other programs that will definitely write a floppy image?
2008-03-20T17:24:00.000Z	waylandbill	nicodarious	I don't know if gnomebaker will. I'm curious, so I'll find out.
2008-03-20T17:25:00.000Z	nicodarious	waylandbill	i'm trying that too right now also.
2008-03-20T17:26:00.000Z	nicodarious	waylandbill	I found that Nero has a Linux install.  I want to try that one too.  I'll let you know.
2008-03-20T17:28:00.000Z	nicodarious	waylandbill	it seems that Nero Linux 3 has a DOS boot image with the install.  Going to try that out and reboot.  I'll let you know when I come back
2008-03-20T17:29:00.000Z	waylandbill	nicodarious	thanks. I may have to check it out.
2008-03-20T17:31:00.000Z	nicodarious	waylandbill	if this works, It may just well be worth the $20.00 for the full version... to me.
