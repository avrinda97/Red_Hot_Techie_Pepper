2006-11-24T06:07:00.000Z	asqueella		sorry to repeat myself, but anyone knows how can I make ubuntu play music at a specified time?
2006-11-24T06:08:00.000Z	asqueella		I guess it didn't work out for me with cron and rhythmbox because rhythmbox is a gui app
2006-11-24T06:08:00.000Z	mcphail	asqueella	use "at" or "cron"
2006-11-24T06:08:00.000Z	asqueella		and?..
2006-11-24T06:08:00.000Z	asqueella		it didn't want to actually play the music
2006-11-24T06:08:00.000Z	asqueella		tried that before rhythmbox :)
2006-11-24T06:08:00.000Z	asqueella		sec
2006-11-24T06:09:00.000Z	asqueella	globe	says it can't open default sound device
2006-11-24T06:10:00.000Z	asqueella	globe	thanks for answering by the way
2006-11-24T06:10:00.000Z	asqueella		oh, not again
2006-11-24T06:10:00.000Z	asqueella		yeah, rhythmbox is playing in the background
2006-11-24T06:10:00.000Z	asqueella		I thought we were past those days when linux couldn't play two sounds simultaneously
2006-11-24T06:11:00.000Z	asqueella		oh duh
2006-11-24T06:11:00.000Z	asqueella		thanks a lot
2006-11-24T06:11:00.000Z	mcphail	asqueella	i think you'll have to wait for feisty for that to be sorted
2006-11-24T06:11:00.000Z	asqueella		I can swear I tried stopping rhythmbox before running mpg123 and it didn't work
2006-11-24T06:11:00.000Z	asqueella		for what?
2006-11-24T06:12:00.000Z	mcphail	asqueella	the next ubuntu release (or maybe the one after that - i can't remember)
