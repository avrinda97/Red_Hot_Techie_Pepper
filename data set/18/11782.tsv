2006-06-17T13:33:00.000Z	Khaotik		Should i upgrade to dapper from breezy?
2006-06-17T13:33:00.000Z	Khaotik		I hear automatix currently only works with breezy
2006-06-17T13:33:00.000Z	Khaotik		?
2006-06-17T13:33:00.000Z	Khaotik		Ah
2006-06-17T13:33:00.000Z	Khaotik		Ok its apt-get distupgrade right?
2006-06-17T13:34:00.000Z	Khaotik		Oh
2006-06-17T13:34:00.000Z	Khaotik		:(
2006-06-17T13:34:00.000Z	ormiret	Khaotik	update manager can do the upgrade
2006-06-17T13:34:00.000Z	Khaotik		armiret
2006-06-17T13:35:00.000Z	Khaotik	ormiret	will it cause any problems you think
2006-06-17T13:35:00.000Z	Khaotik		And will it keep my ap sources?
2006-06-17T13:35:00.000Z	Khaotik		apt*
2006-06-17T13:36:00.000Z	ormiret	Khaotik	it should be fairly clean - it has logic to chack things are happening sanely, but it does depend how far your system is from a stock breezy install
2006-06-17T13:36:00.000Z	Khaotik		Ah
2006-06-17T13:37:00.000Z	ormiret	Khaotik	yes to the apt sources
2006-06-17T13:37:00.000Z	Khaotik		For some reason when i run synaptic there is nothing to check off
2006-06-17T13:37:00.000Z	Khaotik		only what is already installed
2006-06-17T13:37:00.000Z	ormiret	Khaotik	update-manager rather than synaptic
