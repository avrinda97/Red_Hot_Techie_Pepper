2010-09-24T13:41:00.000Z	th3hate	johnx	i finally got my gui back thanks :P
2010-09-24T13:41:00.000Z	johnx	th3hate	hot sauce. next part is to get the nvidia driver setup properly so you have 3D and stuff
2010-09-24T13:41:00.000Z	th3hate	johnx	download from nvidia.com?
2010-09-24T13:41:00.000Z	johnx	th3hate	hit administration -> additional drivers
2010-09-24T13:42:00.000Z	th3hate	johnx	it's searching
2010-09-24T13:42:00.000Z	th3hate	johnx	yep (version current) (recommeneded)
2010-09-24T13:43:00.000Z	th3hate	johnx	it says this driver is not activated
2010-09-24T13:43:00.000Z	th3hate	johnx	downloading and installing
2010-09-24T13:44:00.000Z	th3hate	johnx	what caused this problem in the first place?
2010-09-24T13:45:00.000Z	johnx	th3hate	dunno exactly. between 10.04 and 10.10 it looks like the nvidia driver changed quite a bit and for some reason the new one wasn't automatically downloaded and installed during the upgraded process
2010-09-24T13:49:00.000Z	johnx	th3hate	anyways, catch me back on #maemo or #ubuntu+1 if things don't work
2010-09-24T13:49:00.000Z	th3hate	johnx	thanks for help
