2005-11-28T12:19:00.000Z	N6REJ		Intelikey: well, here goes reboot 34252334328979 tonight!
2005-11-28T12:19:00.000Z	N6REJ		lool
2005-11-28T12:20:00.000Z	N6REJ		FAILED!
2005-11-28T12:20:00.000Z	N6REJ		grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
2005-11-28T12:21:00.000Z	ajmitch_	N6REJ	what's breaking?
2005-11-28T12:24:00.000Z	ajmitch_	N6REJ	do (did) you have you important data in mysql?
2005-11-28T12:24:00.000Z	ajmitch_	N6REJ	then you could change the mount point in /etc/fstab to mount the partition on /var/lib/mysql & recreate the databases?
2005-11-28T12:25:00.000Z	ajmitch_	N6REJ	saying what fails would help :)
2005-11-28T12:26:00.000Z	ajmitch_	N6REJ	can you give more info apart from 'fails'? error messages?
2005-11-28T12:26:00.000Z	ajmitch_	N6REJ	and how were you mounting manually?
2005-11-28T12:27:00.000Z	ajmitch_	N6REJ	use a pastebin to show me your /etc/fstab
2005-11-28T12:28:00.000Z	N6REJ	ajmitch_	http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl/4906 this works, but mysql puts its data in /var/lib/mysql not /usr/local/mysql
2005-11-28T12:29:00.000Z	ajmitch_	N6REJ	right, if you change that to /var/lib/mysql & put it *after* the line that mounts /var.. you might have better luck
2005-11-28T12:29:00.000Z	ajmitch_	N6REJ	since /var/lib/mysql won't exist as a mountpoint before /var is mounted
2005-11-28T12:31:00.000Z	ajmitch_	N6REJ	I'd suggest moving the data out of /var/lib/mysql before you mount it, and back in afterwards
2005-11-28T12:41:00.000Z	N6REJ	ajmitch_	typoed the /etc/fstab field so trying again..
2005-11-28T12:42:00.000Z	N6REJ	ajmitch_	WAHOOOOOOOOOOOO!!  I owe you one! :D
2005-11-28T12:42:00.000Z	N6REJ	ajmitch_	would you feel deprived if I put that in a wiki?
