2008-01-03T05:23:00.000Z	simmerz		I've followed all the guides available for getting dvd's to play and it just won't happen. All the encrypted bits just stay encrypted. tried the medibuntu method too and that doesn't work either. what gives?
2008-01-03T05:24:00.000Z	simmerz		yep, none of them play if they've got encryption
2008-01-03T05:24:00.000Z	Daviey	simmerz	clearly it's not giving... what player are you using?
2008-01-03T05:25:00.000Z	simmerz	Daviey	every player under the sun. xine, with any number of ui's, mplayer (again with different ui's), totem, vlc. none work
2008-01-03T05:27:00.000Z	simmerz	Daviey	any other suggestions?
2008-01-03T05:27:00.000Z	Daviey	simmerz	It would seem that the CSS 'example' script isn't actually running - have you tried running it from source?
2008-01-03T05:28:00.000Z	simmerz	Daviey	I've currently got libdvdcss2 installed from medibuntu
2008-01-03T05:28:00.000Z	Daviey	simmerz	works for most.. suprised it's not working - i would try installing the css script from source and see if it moans
2008-01-03T05:29:00.000Z	simmerz	Daviey	gxine even crashes on start up, helpfully"!
2008-01-03T05:35:00.000Z	simmerz	Daviey	totem-xine suggests that libdvdcss isn't installed, but it really is
2008-01-03T05:38:00.000Z	Daviey	simmerz	It sounds very much like it isn't installed.. have you tried $ sudo apt-get remove --purge libdvdcss2 ; sudo apt-get install libdvdcss2
2008-01-03T05:40:00.000Z	simmerz	Daviey	just done that, still get the same error
2008-01-03T05:41:00.000Z	simmerz	Daviey	I have /usr/lib/libdvdcss.so.2 -> libdvdcss.so.2.0.8
2008-01-03T05:41:00.000Z	Daviey	simmerz	Sorry, no idea - not heard of it just not working before, maybe it's a dvd drive problem?
2008-01-03T05:42:00.000Z	simmerz	Daviey	the same dvd worked before when i was running gentoo. same hardware
2008-01-03T05:43:00.000Z	Daviey	simmerz	no idea, hit launchpad answers if i were you.  https://answers.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu (or the forums)
2008-01-03T05:43:00.000Z	simmerz	Daviey	thanks
2008-01-03T05:48:00.000Z	simmerz	Daviey	could it be the region setting? wondering if the region mask is wrong
