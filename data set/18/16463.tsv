2005-11-19T17:18:00.000Z	blackhat		when I try to use dpkg -i *.deb to install a file, I get this error "dpkg: syntax error: unknown group `postdrop' in statusoverride file"
2005-11-19T17:19:00.000Z	bob2	blackhat	what did you to do your system?
2005-11-19T17:20:00.000Z	bob2	blackhat	copying the /etc/group from outside the chroot into it is the simplest solution
2005-11-19T17:21:00.000Z	bob2	blackhat	'grep postdrop /etc/group', in the chroot, prints what?
2005-11-19T17:21:00.000Z	bob2	blackhat	then you didn't copy /etc/group into the chroot
2005-11-19T17:22:00.000Z	bob2	blackhat	what does it print outside the chroot?
2005-11-19T17:23:00.000Z	bob2	blackhat	you removed postfix?
2005-11-19T17:23:00.000Z	bob2	blackhat	what does 'dpkg -l postfix | tail -n1' print outside the chroot?
2005-11-19T17:25:00.000Z	bob2	blackhat	so you did remove postfix then
2005-11-19T17:37:00.000Z	bob2	blackhat	a) don't run it as root, b) that binary install you did is broken
2005-11-19T17:37:00.000Z	bob2	blackhat	install libstdc++6
2005-11-19T17:51:00.000Z	bob2	blackhat	~/
