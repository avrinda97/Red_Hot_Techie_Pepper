2005-07-29T05:56:00.000Z	skyhawker		is there an easy way of finding all my ntfs partitions and mounting them...I forgot to check the changes I made to whatever file it was before I switched to 32-bit
2005-07-29T05:57:00.000Z	thoreauputic	skyhawker	type  sudo fdisk -l I guess
2005-07-29T05:58:00.000Z	skyhawker	thoreauputic	can I automatically mount them somehow...maybe with the labels they had in wondows *hope* :)
2005-07-29T05:59:00.000Z	thoreauputic	skyhawker	you might need to add them to /etc/fstab
2005-07-29T06:02:00.000Z	skyhawker	thoreauputic	what would I put under <optioins> in the /etc/fstab
2005-07-29T06:03:00.000Z	skyhawker	thoreauputic	for NTFS parts that is
2005-07-29T06:03:00.000Z	thoreauputic	skyhawker	something like   noauto,ro,user,umask=022 0 0
2005-07-29T06:04:00.000Z	skyhawker	thoreauputic	so it can only be read only?
2005-07-29T06:04:00.000Z	thoreauputic	skyhawker	ntfs is read only , yes
2005-07-29T06:05:00.000Z	skyhawker	thoreauputic	thanks
2005-07-29T06:05:00.000Z	thoreauputic	skyhawker	no problem
2005-07-29T06:07:00.000Z	thoreauputic	skyhawker	if you want it to mount on boot substitute auto for noauto
2005-07-29T06:09:00.000Z	thoreauputic	skyhawker	it's a script - you need to make it executable or use sh <scriptname>
2005-07-29T06:10:00.000Z	skyhawker	thoreauputic	oh ok, but I click the link there, and it shows it to me in firefox...do I copy it into my own file, or is there a download option in firefox that I just haven't looked for yet..
2005-07-29T06:10:00.000Z	thoreauputic	skyhawker	you don't need it unless you are laundering mail for a windows network/nox
2005-07-29T06:11:00.000Z	thoreauputic	skyhawker	it's text - just right click and "save as"
2005-07-29T06:11:00.000Z	skyhawker	thoreauputic	ok I got ...I feel really stupid now :)
2005-07-29T06:24:00.000Z	thoreauputic	skyhawker	 dpkg -L <packagename> | grep bin
