2011-04-15T18:31:00.000Z	dexeb		Need help. apt-get install xfonts-wqy keeps hanging at 20+ kB progress. I've tried changing repo to sg, tw, au & my, but that didn't help. Can someone try to install xfonts-wqy to see if this is affecting everyone or just me?
2011-04-15T18:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dexeb	works fine here
2011-04-15T18:33:00.000Z	dexeb	ActionParsnip	simply doesn't work for me. did apt-get clean & autoclean, but nothing works. any clue?
2011-04-15T18:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dexeb	i'm on natty but its still the same server
2011-04-15T18:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dexeb	i use the gb server
2011-04-15T18:35:00.000Z	dexeb	ActionParsnip	i'm on lucid 10.04.2. not sure if that's why... lemme go try gb server
2011-04-15T18:45:00.000Z	dexeb	ActionParsnip	I changed repo to gb server, successfully did "apt-get update", but "apt-get install xfonts-wqy" now hangs at [Waiting for headers]. After a while, it'll abort with error message: "Err http://gb.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ lucid/main xfonts-wqy 0.9.9-3.2   Connection failed"
2011-04-15T18:46:00.000Z	dexeb	ActionParsnip	Weird thing is that I can install any other packages except xfonts-wqy
2011-04-15T18:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dexeb	try grabbing the deb file from packages.ubuntu.com
2011-04-15T18:47:00.000Z	dexeb	ActionParsnip	but if I install it using dpkg, it'll not be updated in the future when there's a new version in the repo, right?
2011-04-15T18:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dexeb	yes as the package is the same name, the updater will see a newer version an upgrade it
2011-04-15T18:49:00.000Z	dexeb	ActionParsnip	I see. Let me go try dpkg -i the .deb now.
2011-04-15T19:05:00.000Z	dexeb	ActionParsnip	It's very interesting. I tried downloading xfonts-wqy_0.9.9-3.2_all.deb from 10 different mirrors across the globe and they all hang after downloading 15 to 28kb of data. I've never encountered anything like this before. It behaves as if something is blocking the data transfer after it detected certain data patterns in the xfonts-wqy file... Any more tips?
2011-04-15T19:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dexeb	not sure, I'll try make you a dropbox link :)
2011-04-15T19:07:00.000Z	dexeb	ActionParsnip	Thanks. You may want to gzip it in case it's really the file contents causing the problem.
2011-04-15T19:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dexeb	http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8850924/Images/xfonts-wqy_0.9.9-3.2_all.deb.gz
2011-04-15T19:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dexeb	let me know when you have it
2011-04-15T19:13:00.000Z	dexeb	ActionParsnip	It works! D/L ok, dpkg -i ok. Thanks so much for all your efforts! Problem solved but root cause still unknown. I'll hate it if it's my ISP playing punk behind the scene... :) Thanks again, ActionParsnip.
