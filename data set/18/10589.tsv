2007-01-31T17:22:00.000Z	shwouchk		what is the correct way to set up ubuntu to use an WPA2 ap? anyone? please?
2007-01-31T06:09:00.000Z	shwouchk		hw do I tell apt-get to install recommended packages?
2007-01-31T06:10:00.000Z	cosmodad	shwouchk	use aptitude: aptitude install -r <package>
2007-01-31T06:10:00.000Z	cosmodad	shwouchk	use sudo, for sure
2007-01-31T06:11:00.000Z	shwouchk	cosmodad	it doesnt have the recommended in the list this way
2007-01-31T06:12:00.000Z	cosmodad	shwouchk	the manpage says it should do so. Maybe you're mixing up suggests and recommends?
2007-01-31T06:13:00.000Z	shwouchk	cosmodad	Recommended packages: esound-clients
2007-01-31T06:14:00.000Z	shwouchk	cosmodad	btw, how do I also install suggested?
2007-01-31T06:14:00.000Z	cosmodad	shwouchk	strange. do you need a bunch of recommends? if not, you could add them by hand
2007-01-31T06:14:00.000Z	cosmodad	shwouchk	I wouldn't know
2007-01-31T06:16:00.000Z	shwouchk	cosmodad	no - it's just one, but I'd like to know how to do it, so that when it will be a bunch, Itll also add them
2007-01-31T06:18:00.000Z	cosmodad	shwouchk	can you give me a package with a recommendation?
2007-01-31T06:24:00.000Z	shwouchk	cosmodad	yes, sorry it took me a while to respond
2007-01-31T06:25:00.000Z	shwouchk	cosmodad	xchat recommends esound-clients
2007-01-31T06:26:00.000Z	cosmodad	shwouchk	I wanted to try but I've got that one installed already...
2007-01-31T06:26:00.000Z	shwouchk	cosmodad	oh :(
2007-01-31T06:26:00.000Z	cosmodad	shwouchk	let me look for something else...
2007-01-31T06:28:00.000Z	cosmodad	shwouchk	I cannot find one... you don't have the recommended package already installed, do you?
