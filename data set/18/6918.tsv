2008-03-04T07:27:00.000Z	Lowkey		Can anyone help me? My top bar on all my windows is grey, I can't move them nor do I have minimize, maximize, or close.
2008-03-04T07:27:00.000Z	bazhang	Lowkey	running compiz?
2008-03-04T07:27:00.000Z	Lowkey		yes
2008-03-04T07:28:00.000Z	bazhang	Lowkey	try disabling it
2008-03-04T07:28:00.000Z	Lowkey		yeah I can move them now
2008-03-04T07:29:00.000Z	Lowkey		only on none, not on normal
2008-03-04T07:29:00.000Z	bazhang	Lowkey	go into ccsm and enable move windows
2008-03-04T07:29:00.000Z	Lowkey		ok
2008-03-04T07:31:00.000Z	Lowkey	bazhang	it didn't work
2008-03-04T07:32:00.000Z	bazhang	Lowkey	you disabled compiz and it was okay then re-enabled compiz with the move windows plug in enabled and same behaviour? what else you have on that system? awn or something else? how much ram
2008-03-04T07:33:00.000Z	Lowkey	bazhang	512mb ram - nothing but rar unrar and vlc
2008-03-04T07:33:00.000Z	bazhang	Lowkey	and you followed the steps I outlined? that is odd
2008-03-04T07:35:00.000Z	Lowkey	bazhang	yeah I enabled move windows
2008-03-04T07:36:00.000Z	bazhang	Lowkey	how about closing those windows and refreshing the desktop and trying again once you have disabled and re-enabled compiz--how did you disable compiz by the way
2008-03-04T07:37:00.000Z	Lowkey		under visuals in appearance
2008-03-04T07:38:00.000Z	bazhang	Lowkey	alt f2 metacity --replace
2008-03-04T07:38:00.000Z	Lowkey		eh?
2008-03-04T07:40:00.000Z	bazhang	Lowkey	type alt f2 (keys) then type in the box metacity --replace
