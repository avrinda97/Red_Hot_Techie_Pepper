2005-05-15T07:55:00.000Z	kevin06		Hey, I have a few questions for you guys, especially anyone who has used Debian...
2005-05-15T07:55:00.000Z	kevin06		I have had a lot of issues with it, and I am considering changing distros...
2005-05-15T07:56:00.000Z	kevin06		What would you guys say are Ubuntu's advantages, over, say Debian.
2005-05-15T07:57:00.000Z	icebalm	kevin06	why do you ask?
2005-05-15T07:57:00.000Z	kevin06	icebalm	I am kinda tired of all of the problems I have been having with Debian, and I am looking to possible switch distros.
2005-05-15T07:58:00.000Z	icebalm	kevin06	what problems?
2005-05-15T07:59:00.000Z	kevin06	icebalm	well, first, it took a buttload of configuring to get to run at the right resolution. Then, I was having files vanish, a lot of conflicts from the base install.
2005-05-15T07:59:00.000Z	kevin06	icebalm	my problem now is that is freezes on startup.
2005-05-15T07:59:00.000Z	icebalm	kevin06	sounds like hardware problems
2005-05-15T08:00:00.000Z	kevin06	icebalm	I fear that.
2005-05-15T08:01:00.000Z	icebalm	kevin06	files shouldn't just dissapear, your lockups could be because of missing files, possibly a bad HD?
2005-05-15T08:01:00.000Z	kevin06	icebalm	I can access the disk through other ones...
2005-05-15T08:01:00.000Z	icebalm	kevin06	"access the disk through other ones"? what?
2005-05-15T08:02:00.000Z	kevin06	icebalm	LOL Sorry. If I use the disk as an external, it works without an issue. In fact, I can even edit and alter some of the files Debian =claims are missing.
2005-05-15T08:02:00.000Z	icebalm	kevin06	what filesystem are you using?
2005-05-15T08:02:00.000Z	kevin06	icebalm	ext2
2005-05-15T08:03:00.000Z	icebalm	kevin06	might be time for ext3
