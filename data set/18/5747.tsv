2008-08-27T20:58:00.000Z	TJ-Linux		you said is it possible that it has something to do with the ati drivers? I can't figure out what it is that you're referring to?
2008-08-27T20:58:00.000Z	user339	TJ-Linux	hi. I need help. I'm trying to get my ubuntu 8.04 with dualsceen to work (ati x800). One 24" on dvi output and one 15" on vga. The thing is i installed the ati drivers with envyng successfully and am able to configure the graphicscard using the catalyst control center, but everytime i use the option big desoktop wich sould enable dualscreen and not clne mode onece I restart everything is back to clone output
2008-08-27T20:59:00.000Z	user339	TJ-Linux	and somehow big desktop seems to work while i'm in the logon screen.. which means I can move the mouse from one desktop to another
2008-08-27T20:59:00.000Z	user339	TJ-Linux	I'm totally stuck..
2008-08-27T21:00:00.000Z	TJ-Linux	user339	i gave up on ati for dual screen, however I did spend a lot fo time on it.  are you correctly applying the settings in the ati control panel to the xorg.conf file?
2008-08-27T21:00:00.000Z	TJ-Linux		the control panel allows you to use settings without applying them to the xorg.conf
2008-08-27T21:01:00.000Z	user339	TJ-Linux	yes but it seems that the setting go back to default after the logon scree.. for whatever reason
2008-08-27T21:02:00.000Z	TJ-Linux	user339	did you look inside your xorg.conf file and see that the settings for big desktop were set?  can you use paste.ubuntu.com to show me your xorg.conf
2008-08-27T21:04:00.000Z	user339	TJ-Linux	http://paste.ubuntu.com/40948/
2008-08-27T21:05:00.000Z	user339	TJ-Linux	It doesn't seem that the bigdesktop setting is set.. although I used CCC to configure it correctly
2008-08-27T21:08:00.000Z	TJ-Linux	user339	i don't see big desktop setup in there (coincidentally, that's the exact same video card I dumped last week).  make sure you backup your xorg before doing anything.    try doing it manually with the aticonfig command by reading this webpage: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=301941.  basically the options with aticonfig you will want are to use --desktop-setup=? --sync-vsync=on and --add-pairmode=?
2008-08-27T21:08:00.000Z	TJ-Linux		i'm a little suspicious that in the ATI CCC you still aren't correctly saving the settings, but I don't have CCC installed anymore to provide you help with that
2008-08-27T21:09:00.000Z	user339	TJ-Linux	ok thanks, I'll try it
2008-08-27T21:09:00.000Z	TJ-Linux		that's about the extent of what I can help with, but if you still have difficulty, try asking again
2008-08-27T21:10:00.000Z	user339	TJ-Linux	ok :)
