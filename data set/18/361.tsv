2012-05-29T00:39:00.000Z	bibi23	genii-around	yes I know that's what I want to check the groups of the user before overwriting them
2012-05-29T00:40:00.000Z	genii-around	bibi23	groups
2012-05-29T01:44:00.000Z	bibi23	genii-around	no I said the opposite ;)
2012-05-29T01:44:00.000Z	genii-around	bibi23	Ubuntu is designed with the idea not to be using root user if necessary, mostly to protect users from themself.
2012-05-29T01:45:00.000Z	genii-around	bibi23	Aaah.. it was ambiguously worded then. The sudo factoid is what you want, as ejv pointed out
2012-05-29T01:46:00.000Z	bibi23	genii-around	yes when I read it again you're right lol
2012-05-29T02:05:00.000Z	genii-around	bibi23	If you edited already the /etc/group to add yourself back in to the admin/sudo group, why are you editing the sudoers file?
2012-05-29T02:11:00.000Z	bibi23	genii-around	I didn't add myself to the admin/sudo group, I was planning to edit the sudoers file, is it correct? my goal is to be able to run "sudo service apache2 reload"
2012-05-29T02:12:00.000Z	genii-around	bibi23	admin users automatically have sudo
2012-05-29T02:13:00.000Z	bibi23	genii-around	when you said admin you mean root? I never heard about admin group, basically I just hhave to add me to this group and it's ok?
2012-05-29T02:13:00.000Z	genii-around	bibi23	Normally the first user created is in this group by default and sudo works automatically for them. but you removed your user from this group.
2012-05-29T02:14:00.000Z	genii-around	bibi23	The root user is disabled on Ubuntu. People who are allowed temporary root are admin
2012-05-29T02:14:00.000Z	bibi23	genii-around	there were only root user at the beginning
2012-05-29T02:16:00.000Z	genii-around	bibi23	This is not the normal configuration of Ubuntu. You should contact the provider of your virtual machine in this case.
2012-05-29T02:20:00.000Z	bibi23	genii-around	the admin group doesn't exist on my server, when I do usermod -aG admin bibi23, it says usermod: group 'admin' does not exist
2012-05-29T02:21:00.000Z	genii-around	bibi23	Try adm instead
2012-05-29T02:21:00.000Z	bibi23	genii-around	oh yes it did it thx
