2008-06-30T13:58:00.000Z	Unislash		hey guys :). For some reason, my windows installation wants to name it's root drive G: instead of C:. Is there any way to fix this? I am totally willing to reinstall :P. I know this is totally a windows question, but if you guys have no suggestions... then i'd ask about how windows decides to name it's drives, followed by how to affect this from ubuntu (hence, it's an ubuntu question in disguise)
2008-06-30T13:58:00.000Z	Unislash		hmmm, wow. tell me where my last message got cut off :/
2008-06-30T13:58:00.000Z	Unislash		lol
2008-06-30T13:58:00.000Z	Unislash		continue reading :P
2008-06-30T13:59:00.000Z	Unislash		meh, woa there buddy...
2008-06-30T14:00:00.000Z	Unislash		i should not have even mentioned windows. gosh... i didn't know you guys hated dual booters :/
2008-06-30T14:00:00.000Z	Unislash		lol
2008-06-30T14:01:00.000Z	soundray	Unislash	there is no emotion involved in this. It's just that your question is inappropriate for here. Why not ask in ##windows ?
2008-06-30T14:01:00.000Z	Unislash		well, here's my situation
2008-06-30T14:02:00.000Z	Unislash		i'm trying to dualboot, and right now, i can't even get ubuntu to boot because my windows overrode grub
2008-06-30T14:02:00.000Z	Unislash		thanks
2008-06-30T14:02:00.000Z	Unislash		lol, i have been
2008-06-30T14:03:00.000Z	Unislash		and that's exactly what i did :P
2008-06-30T14:03:00.000Z	Unislash		so, now i'm trying to reinstall it, but instead of trying to fix it once it's installed, i'm trying to fix it before and get it to have a normal letter
2008-06-30T14:03:00.000Z	Unislash		therefore, i'm asking how to affect drive letters from ubuntu
2008-06-30T14:04:00.000Z	Unislash		because i can boot from ubuntu before i reinstall it
2008-06-30T14:05:00.000Z	Unislash	wols	sorry, but i'm asking a totally valid ubuntu question... how do you affect drive letters using ubuntu? you should be able to
2008-06-30T14:05:00.000Z	soundray	Unislash	it's not an ubuntu question. Ubuntu does not have drive letter
