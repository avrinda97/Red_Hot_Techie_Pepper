2008-05-06T20:34:00.000Z	erUSUL	dbe	should "just work (tm)"
2008-05-06T20:35:00.000Z	dbe	erUSUL	It did but after a reboot I get this from the Volume Control: No volume control GStreamer plugins and/or devices found.

2008-05-06T20:37:00.000Z	dbe	erUSUL	alsamixer: function snd_ctl_open failed for default: No such file or directory
2008-05-06T20:37:00.000Z	dbe	erUSUL	I just executed "alsamixer"
2008-05-06T20:37:00.000Z	dbe	erUSUL	As root of course.

2008-05-06T20:41:00.000Z	dbe	erUSUL	Linux dbe-desktop 2.6.24-16-386 #1 Sun Apr 27 17:23:02 UTC 2008 i686 GNU/Linux
2008-05-06T20:41:00.000Z	erUSUL	dbe	why are you using the 386 version? that version is for ald hard and seems to lack the needed driver... you should be using the default generic kernel
2008-05-06T20:42:00.000Z	dbe	erUSUL	I use gNewSense that is build on Hardy Heron. It was released one week after Hardy Heron. I might speak with someone in #gnewsense.
2008-05-06T20:43:00.000Z	dbe	erUSUL	Thanks for your help
2008-05-06T20:43:00.000Z	erUSUL	dbe	ok; good luck.
