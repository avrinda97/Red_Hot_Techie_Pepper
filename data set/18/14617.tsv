2006-04-05T14:12:00.000Z	elvstone		hey guys.
2006-04-05T14:13:00.000Z	elvstone		i just finished assembling my new beefy computer. wohoo.
2006-04-05T14:13:00.000Z	elvstone		it runs fine.
2006-04-05T14:13:00.000Z	elvstone		all i've got here is a breezy/amd64 CD.
2006-04-05T14:13:00.000Z	elvstone		and up in the apartment where the computer is, i have no Internet.
2006-04-05T14:13:00.000Z	elvstone		what are my partition editing capabilities in the breezy install?
2006-04-05T14:14:00.000Z	elvstone		will i be able to create partitions before the partitions i'll be installing ubuntu onto?
2006-04-05T14:14:00.000Z	elvstone		..because freebsd will probably be my main os on the machine.. so i want to reserve a partition for it before the ubuntu partition.
2006-04-05T14:15:00.000Z	elvstone		can i create FreeBSD partititions with it?
2006-04-05T14:15:00.000Z	elvstone		i mean, will it allow me to choose the partition type.
2006-04-05T14:16:00.000Z	bimberi	elvstone	you don't need expert mode, just choose to edit the partition table manually during the normalinstall and leave some unpartitioned space where you want to
2006-04-05T14:17:00.000Z	elvstone	bimberi	ah. i can create a partition at an offset into the disk, without creating a partition that fills that space?
2006-04-05T14:17:00.000Z	bimberi	elvstone	i haven't done it myself but i'm fairly sure you can
2006-04-05T14:17:00.000Z	elvstone	bimberi	okay. if it won't work then i'll just play around with the installer a bit and work it out.
2006-04-05T14:19:00.000Z	bimberi	elvstone	that's the way :) (playing -> learning)
2006-04-05T14:19:00.000Z	elvstone	bimberi	heh. i used linux for over 5 years before i installed freebsd on my rusty old laptop.
2006-04-05T14:20:00.000Z	bimberi	elvstone	 ubunut :)
2006-04-05T14:20:00.000Z	elvstone	bimberi	heh! perfect word for my brother.
