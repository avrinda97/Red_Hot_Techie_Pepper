2007-11-01T17:12:00.000Z	Pici	burwaco	Firestarter is just a frontend to the firewall, iptables is installed.
2007-11-01T17:12:00.000Z	burwaco	Pici	hello, nice to see you again... firestarter isn't standard ?
2007-11-01T17:12:00.000Z	Pici	burwaco	No. Its not, no firewall frontends are install by default. The firewall itself (iptables) is installed.
2007-11-01T17:53:00.000Z	Pici	burwaco	what ati card do you have?
2007-11-01T17:54:00.000Z	burwaco	Pici	01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: ATI Technologies Inc RV350 [Mobility Radeon 9600 M10]

2007-11-01T17:57:00.000Z	Pici	burwaco	The link there provides information about unblacklisting your card, but it may not work perfectly.
2007-11-01T18:24:00.000Z	Pici	burwaco	did you follow the unblacklist procedure in the link from ubotu?
2007-11-01T18:24:00.000Z	burwaco	Pici	not yet, but it seems to work without it, I took note of your link...
