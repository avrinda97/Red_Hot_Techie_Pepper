2007-07-01T06:17:00.000Z	vip3rousmango	mwe	i mounted it via gmount
2007-07-01T06:18:00.000Z	mwe	vip3rousmango	what is complaining?
2007-07-01T06:18:00.000Z	vip3rousmango	mwe	if i right click on it to unmount i get error: umount: /media/cdrom0 is not mounted (according to ftab)
2007-07-01T06:19:00.000Z	mwe	vip3rousmango	you need to explain what you're doing
2007-07-01T06:19:00.000Z	vip3rousmango	mwe	ok nvm it just magiclly dissapeared off my desktop..
2007-07-01T06:20:00.000Z	vip3rousmango	mwe	i opened up gmount to mount this .iso. gmount asked me where to mount it either cdrom or cdrom0 so i picked cdrom, and cdrom0 came up and then when i tryed to unmount the image because i realized i had to burn it to a disk rather than run it it wouldn't unmount for some reason
2007-07-01T06:21:00.000Z	mwe	vip3rousmango	I see
2007-07-01T06:22:00.000Z	vip3rousmango	mwe	yeah, kinda weird no?
2007-07-01T06:22:00.000Z	mwe	vip3rousmango	sounds odd yes
