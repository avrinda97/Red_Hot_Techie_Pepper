2008-02-17T09:47:00.000Z	Snurglewozzle		You know, just fix the startup problems
2008-02-17T09:47:00.000Z	Snurglewozzle		I can't get past the initial screens without hitting "OK"
2008-02-17T09:47:00.000Z	Snurglewozzle		man, DO NOT install xubuntu, by the way. impossible to get back out of it without major problems.
2008-02-17T09:47:00.000Z	Snurglewozzle		no exec line in the session file
2008-02-17T09:47:00.000Z	Snurglewozzle		no exec line in the session file: xcfe 4
2008-02-17T09:48:00.000Z	Snurglewozzle		how can I find the session file to remove that line from?
2008-02-17T09:49:00.000Z	Snurglewozzle		kde might be ok, but xubuntu doesn't install cleanly on top of ubuntu
2008-02-17T09:49:00.000Z	Snurglewozzle		how can I find the session file to remove a trouble-making line?
2008-02-17T09:49:00.000Z	Snurglewozzle		the error I get on startup is: "no exec line in the session file"
2008-02-17T09:49:00.000Z	Snurglewozzle		no exec line in the session file: xfce 4
2008-02-17T09:49:00.000Z	nickrud	Snurglewozzle	it's probably in ~/.xfce4 (?)
2008-02-17T09:50:00.000Z	nickrud	Snurglewozzle	that's a directory, look for the session file in there
2008-02-17T09:51:00.000Z	nickrud	Snurglewozzle	on the gui login screen, select options->session
2008-02-17T09:51:00.000Z	nickrud	Snurglewozzle	there's your problem :)
2008-02-17T09:53:00.000Z	nickrud	Snurglewozzle	the login manager is trying to start the desktop you last used, which was xfce4. But, xfce4 is gone.  Log out, and at the gui options->session->gnome
2008-02-17T09:53:00.000Z	nickrud	Snurglewozzle	just logging out should get you to the login iirc
2008-02-17T09:56:00.000Z	nickrud	Snurglewozzle	good on ya!
2008-02-17T09:56:00.000Z	Snurglewozzle	nickrud	I am now doing a full reboot (after changing login info) -- keep your fingers crossed
