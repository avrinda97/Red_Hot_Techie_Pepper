2007-03-12T09:47:00.000Z	GionnyBoss	yomm	ahahah! Well, theres windows too on this computer, so he can continue using windows as before but... Id really like to let him use Ubuntu
2007-03-12T09:48:00.000Z	GionnyBoss	yomm	its a VIA S3G UniChrome Pro IGP integrated graphic card... Ubuntu doesnt recognise it and use the "vesa" driver, but it is so slow... unusable when you move a window or do a scrolling
2007-03-12T09:51:00.000Z	GionnyBoss	yomm	I can try it. The problem is that I cant find a driver
2007-03-12T09:51:00.000Z	GionnyBoss	yomm	I afraid that this card is not supported
2007-03-12T09:52:00.000Z	yomm	GionnyBoss	: have you tried : sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" & then selecting S3 driver ?
2007-03-12T09:52:00.000Z	GionnyBoss	yomm	but I wanted to ask here so I can get some advices from the people here. What would zou do?
2007-03-12T09:52:00.000Z	GionnyBoss	yomm	 is there an S3 driver too?
2007-03-12T09:52:00.000Z	yomm	GionnyBoss	: I thought so , yes
2007-03-12T09:52:00.000Z	GionnyBoss	yomm	I tryed the VIA one... now I check :)
2007-03-12T09:53:00.000Z	yomm	GionnyBoss	: yes there is on Edgy
