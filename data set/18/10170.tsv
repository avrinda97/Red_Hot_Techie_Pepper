2007-01-04T15:11:00.000Z	eitan		Now I can't figure out how to install samba. What a pain...
2007-01-04T15:11:00.000Z	eitan		ok
2007-01-04T15:13:00.000Z	eitan		There IS NO SMB!
2007-01-04T15:13:00.000Z	eitan		.... When I first enabled the shared folders... it said ...
2007-01-04T15:14:00.000Z	eitan		do you want nfs, samba, or both...
2007-01-04T15:14:00.000Z	eitan		I said NFS since all the people here said I shouldn't be using samba...
2007-01-04T15:14:00.000Z	eitan		now I can't install samba anymore...
2007-01-04T15:14:00.000Z	eitan		it only gives nfs as a choice.
2007-01-04T15:15:00.000Z	eitan		The computer I'm talking about is in the other room, so every time you ask me to do something... I have to go running there... so you have to give me time.
