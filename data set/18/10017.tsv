2007-01-20T17:19:00.000Z	Jed		hi. im trying to install ubuntu but it keeps freezing up on me
2007-01-20T17:19:00.000Z	Jed		i've tried 6.06 PC, 6.06 PC64 and 6.10 and they all freeze =(
2007-01-20T17:20:00.000Z	Jed		anyone? :/
2007-01-20T17:21:00.000Z	LjL	Jed	hm when does it freeze
2007-01-20T17:22:00.000Z	Jed	LjL	when its loading the install. all the progress bars go through, then a peach screen comes up and theres a grey line with lots of weird colors in the middle
2007-01-20T17:22:00.000Z	LjL	Jed	have you tried failsafe mode?
2007-01-20T17:23:00.000Z	Jed	LjL	"Start Ubuntu in safe graphics mode" ?
2007-01-20T17:23:00.000Z	LjL	Jed	yes, i meant that
2007-01-20T17:26:00.000Z	Jed	LjL	same thing. it stops right after playing some audio clip
2007-01-20T17:28:00.000Z	LjL	Jed	if you hit Ctrl+Alt+F2, do you get a console?
2007-01-20T17:30:00.000Z	Jed	LjL	yes
2007-01-20T17:30:00.000Z	Jed	LjL	how do i go back to the UI?
2007-01-20T17:30:00.000Z	LjL	Jed	ctrl+alt+F7, but i'm not sure that will help (but try)
2007-01-20T17:31:00.000Z	LjL	Jed	well i suggest you do a "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" in the console that you have, and see if you can get X in a working state
2007-01-20T17:36:00.000Z	Jed	LjL	is there a way that i can install without the GUI?
2007-01-20T17:37:00.000Z	LjL	Jed	yes, you can use the Alternate CD
2007-01-20T17:38:00.000Z	LjL	Jed	however, if the GUI doesn't work in the Desktop CD, chances are it won't work in your installation...
2007-01-20T17:39:00.000Z	LjL	Jed	i don't know, i *could* tell you to try the alternate CD, but it might just end up in wasted time for you
