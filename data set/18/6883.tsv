2008-03-10T02:51:00.000Z	ThomPhoenix		Greetings.
2008-03-10T02:53:00.000Z	ThomPhoenix		I just used bm43-fwcutter to get the broadcom firmware, but how do I actually enable my wireless device now?
2008-03-10T02:55:00.000Z	ThomPhoenix		Where do I got for wireless support? This seems to be more of a chat channel.
2008-03-10T02:55:00.000Z	ThaRabbit	ThomPhoenix	this is support :) what≈õ the problem
2008-03-10T02:58:00.000Z	ThomPhoenix	ThaRabbit	It shows a broadcom device there, yes.
2008-03-10T03:00:00.000Z	ThomPhoenix	ThaRabbit	Well, this is the actual output. Just one line about broadcom. I'm not sure if that is my wireless or the wired though: http://rafb.net/p/ymdpxu26.nln.html
2008-03-10T03:01:00.000Z	ThomPhoenix	ThaRabbit	I think that output was just my wired. ifconfig shows only eth0 and lo.
2008-03-10T03:02:00.000Z	ThomPhoenix	ThaRabbit	Normally I press a button to enable my wireless device, to give it power, but that button doesn't work on Ubuntu, it seems.
2008-03-10T03:04:00.000Z	ThomPhoenix	ThaRabbit	The driver is in the Linux kernel Ubuntu uses (I use Hardy), and I manually extracted the necessary proprietary broadcom firmware. The only issue I have is how to enable the device under Ubuntu.
2008-03-10T03:06:00.000Z	ThomPhoenix	ThaRabbit	any clues?
2008-03-10T03:07:00.000Z	ThomPhoenix	ThaRabbit	Yes. b43
2008-03-10T03:08:00.000Z	ThomPhoenix	ThaRabbit	Yes, I did update.
2008-03-10T03:09:00.000Z	ThomPhoenix	ThaRabbit	If there is a bug report about it, can I have the link?
2008-03-10T03:10:00.000Z	ThomPhoenix	ThaRabbit	Ouch, that is bad to hear. I hope this gets resolved soon.
2008-03-10T03:11:00.000Z	ThomPhoenix	ThaRabbit	I will try. Although, I did a fresh install from the March 8 live cd. Would the issue be in there too?
2008-03-10T03:13:00.000Z	ThomPhoenix	ThaRabbit	Well, I will keep trying. Thanks :)
2008-03-10T03:14:00.000Z	ThomPhoenix	ThaRabbit	Indeed.
2008-03-10T03:15:00.000Z	ThomPhoenix	ThaRabbit	If Ubuntu has troubles activating my broadcom device, it will still have that issue in april, unless I prod about it ;)
