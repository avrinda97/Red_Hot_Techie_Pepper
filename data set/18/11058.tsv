2006-09-21T05:41:00.000Z	Tokenbad		there is no way to fix a tar.gz file is here?
2006-09-21T05:42:00.000Z	variant	Tokenbad	yeah i think there is.. not certain but i remember somthing from a few years back.. check the tar manpage
2006-10-04T15:13:00.000Z	variant	Tokenbad	the latest version of gparted is much much better (its not in apt though, you have to install deps and compile the source)
2006-10-04T15:16:00.000Z	Tokenbad	variant	but how do I find the 30 gigs that is now missing?
2006-10-04T15:16:00.000Z	variant	Tokenbad	you mean 30 gb of data is lost or 30 gb of hte partition is not visible? (the disk seems smaller than it is)?
2006-10-04T15:18:00.000Z	Tokenbad	variant	the disk is smaller than it is
2006-10-04T15:19:00.000Z	variant	Tokenbad	well the updated gparted should help you find it.. but backup all your data as parted/gparted warn you to do before hand
2006-10-04T15:23:00.000Z	Tokenbad	variant	trying to install the new gparted..says libuuid not installed but when tried to apt-get install libuuid1 it says newest is already installed
2006-10-04T15:26:00.000Z	Tokenbad	variant	any idea why it says its not installed when it is?
2006-10-20T06:09:00.000Z	variant	Tokenbad	it is software that allows development of software to be manged with versioning and multiple developers.. if you want to use some software that is available via cvs you will need to "checkout" the source code and then compile it normaly
2006-10-20T06:09:00.000Z	variant	Tokenbad	is that what you want to do?
2006-10-20T06:09:00.000Z	Tokenbad	variant	not sure...I needed to install dxwine and to do that...it needs CVS
2006-10-20T06:10:00.000Z	variant	Tokenbad	what do you mean? does it require that cvs is installed before you can use it? or do you get it from cvs?
2006-10-20T06:11:00.000Z	Tokenbad	variant	they have an install script...and it goes through stuff and then says checking CVS and then quits says CVS not found
2006-10-20T06:13:00.000Z	variant	Tokenbad	in that case do apt-get install cvs
2006-10-20T06:13:00.000Z	Tokenbad	variant	thanks
2006-11-11T07:11:00.000Z	variant	Tokenbad	unmerge tehn remerge
2006-11-11T07:11:00.000Z	variant	Tokenbad	sorry, uninstall then reinstall them
