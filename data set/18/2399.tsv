2010-05-24T19:26:00.000Z	tarikk		hey room
2010-05-24T19:26:00.000Z	tarikk		iim dual booting ubuntu.. i basically installed it along side win7
2010-05-24T19:26:00.000Z	tarikk		but only gave it 10 gigs
2010-05-24T19:27:00.000Z	tarikk		how do i change it and make it bigger?
2010-05-24T19:27:00.000Z	ni1s	tarikk	is there more available free space on the disk?
2010-05-24T19:28:00.000Z	ni1s	tarikk	iirc you can use gparted to resize it
2010-05-24T19:29:00.000Z	tarikk	ni1s	i used gparted but its strange.. i dont see the correct sizes
2010-05-24T19:29:00.000Z	ni1s	tarikk	how do you mean?
2010-05-24T19:30:00.000Z	tarikk	ni1s	i see /dev/sda1 which is host (66gigs 46gigs used).. and /dev/sda3 which is 8gigs (only 600megs used)
2010-05-24T19:30:00.000Z	tarikk	ni1s	im confused. is ubuntu on sda1 or sda3
2010-05-24T19:32:00.000Z	ni1s	tarikk	depends on where you installed it, see the output of readlink /dev/root
2010-05-24T19:32:00.000Z	tarikk	ni1s	it says loop0
2010-05-24T19:34:00.000Z	ni1s	tarikk	i assume you choose to encrypt your install? check the output of df -ha
2010-05-24T19:35:00.000Z	tarikk	ni1s	im not sure wat i did.. output /dev/loop0 9.4g used 8.8. thats the right one
2010-05-24T19:36:00.000Z	ni1s	tarikk	the loops are not disk
2010-05-24T19:36:00.000Z	tarikk	ni1s	ya i guess so. but i have no idea how it works really quite new. any chance i can change it?
2010-05-24T19:37:00.000Z	ni1s	tarikk	see the output of blkid, and no you dont want to change that
2010-05-24T19:39:00.000Z	tarikk	ni1s	blkid returned nothing
