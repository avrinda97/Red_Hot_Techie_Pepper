2009-05-31T20:08:00.000Z	BrixSat		hello
2009-05-31T20:10:00.000Z	BrixSat		how can i make a list of all files content that are inside a folder, and find something inside those files and if any print the file name that contains the searched text, iv been trying cat * | grep text
2009-05-31T20:10:00.000Z	Slart	BrixSat	grep * texttofind  will search inside all files in the current directory
2009-05-31T20:12:00.000Z	Slart	BrixSat	hmm.. perhaps it's the other way around
2009-05-31T20:14:00.000Z	BrixSat	Slart	none of the options return data
2009-05-31T20:14:00.000Z	Slart	BrixSat	hmm.. odd.. can you tell me what kind of files you are searching? what command did you try?
2009-05-31T20:15:00.000Z	Slart	BrixSat	ah.. good =) so it's working alright now?
2009-05-31T20:16:00.000Z	BrixSat	Slart	but not on sub folders but ill read the man ;)
2009-05-31T20:16:00.000Z	Slart	BrixSat	there is a switch to make it search recursively... probably -R or -r
2009-05-31T20:17:00.000Z	Slart	BrixSat	but the man page is a nice read.. grep and it's friends are very useful
2009-05-31T20:18:00.000Z	Slart	BrixSat	a little.. but nothing advanced
2009-05-31T20:18:00.000Z	BrixSat	Slart	problems on virtualhost
2009-05-31T20:19:00.000Z	Slart	BrixSat	never used those.. I'm a one host per server-guy =)
2009-06-14T16:04:00.000Z	Slart	BrixSat	135-139?
2009-06-14T16:04:00.000Z	Slart	BrixSat	might be 445 too
2009-06-14T16:05:00.000Z	Slart	BrixSat	tcp I guess.. but hang on.. let me check
2009-06-14T16:06:00.000Z	Slart	BrixSat	not sure on how accurate this is.. but there it is http://www.chicagotech.net/netforums/viewtopic.php?t=5067
2009-06-14T16:23:00.000Z	Slart	BrixSat	those are the only ports I know of.. I've never actually used windows file sharing through a firewall
