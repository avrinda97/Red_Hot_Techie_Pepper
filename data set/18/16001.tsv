2004-12-06T11:49:00.000Z	kapland		does the development branch work like stable - sid on debian?
2004-12-06T11:50:00.000Z	crimsun	kapland	warty:hoary = woody:sid
2004-12-06T11:51:00.000Z	kapland	crimsun	then wouldn't it me more like warty:hoary woody:sarge ?
2004-12-06T11:51:00.000Z	crimsun	kapland	sure, but there's no staging filter for hoary. Stuff goes directly into hoary.
2004-12-06T11:52:00.000Z	crimsun	kapland	it's called asym.
2004-12-06T11:52:00.000Z	kapland	crimsun	asym?

2004-12-06T11:55:00.000Z	kapland	crimsun	and no hardware mixing?
2004-12-06T11:55:00.000Z	crimsun	kapland	none.
2004-12-06T11:56:00.000Z	kapland	crimsun	ah
2004-12-06T11:57:00.000Z	kapland	crimsun	yeah I think that was what I was trying, could never get firefox (flash) to work while alsa is being used
