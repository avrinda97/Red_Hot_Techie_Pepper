2008-08-26T22:14:00.000Z	sammyF		hey there
2008-08-26T22:14:00.000Z	sammyF		anybody else just had some wild flickering when using Firefox?
2008-08-26T22:15:00.000Z	sammyF		a friend in the UK had it at the same time as me oO
2008-08-26T22:17:00.000Z	sammyF		anybody just experienced weird flickering and reverting from compiz to metacity a few moments ago?
2008-08-26T22:17:00.000Z	d4r1os_	sammyF	my screen is only flickering a few seconds
2008-08-26T22:18:00.000Z	sammyF	d4r1os_	like 1-2 sec, and hten everythign was back to normal (except for metacity being on instead of compiz if you had that on)? when did it happen?
2008-08-26T22:19:00.000Z	sammyF	d4r1os_	cause me and a friend experienced it simultaneously on two computers running 8.04
2008-08-26T22:20:00.000Z	d4r1os_	sammyF	same like me... I do not know why it happens but it happens when I am switching between compiz and metacity using compiz-switch
2008-08-26T22:21:00.000Z	d4r1os_	sammyF	simultaneously??? sounds crazy... ;-)
2008-08-26T22:21:00.000Z	sammyF	d4r1os_	yeah
2008-08-26T22:21:00.000Z	sammyF	d4r1os_	especially as we're only communicating through MSN. no connection between our comps.
2008-08-26T22:22:00.000Z	sammyF	d4r1os_	I was just going to say something about wild flickering when he said "my comp just had an epileptic fit" ;)
2008-08-26T22:22:00.000Z	sammyF	d4r1os_	pidgin on both .. but it seems it's something to do with Firefox. we both were trying to access /. at the same time
2008-08-26T22:25:00.000Z	d4r1os_	sammyF	hm... I think I can not help U
2008-08-26T22:26:00.000Z	sammyF	d4r1os_	nah .. I just wondered if anybody had had the same thing at the same time
2008-08-26T22:26:00.000Z	sammyF	d4r1os_	not much to do apart from waiting to see if it happens again. but thanks :)
2008-08-26T22:26:00.000Z	d4r1os_	sammyF	no problem...
2008-08-26T22:26:00.000Z	d4r1os_	sammyF	you are welcome...
