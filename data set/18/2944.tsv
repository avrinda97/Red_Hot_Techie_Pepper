If you find that no one in the room is able to help you then search in the forums, if it's a bug then search launchpad and/or file a bug report, then try the channel at another time
2010-02-09T09:40:00.000Z	mezquitale	jack5463	i've been in the room for 10-15 minutes and you have yet to describe a problem with ubuntu and that you want to fix it ***now***, all  youre saying is you  always have a problem with ubuntu - youre clearly trolling
2010-02-09T09:42:00.000Z	jack5463	mezquitale	I've had ubuntu fail several times, freeze. Why does it do that?
2010-02-09T10:02:00.000Z	mezquitale	jack5463	how does flash fail when youre using it?  Sound doesnt work or you get no video at all?  I've had the same problem with sound, i see the video but no sound, or the video plays for some time but then it stops
2010-02-09T10:03:00.000Z	jack5463	mezquitale	the window shows up, just black where the video is supposed to be but on other videos it works fine
2010-02-09T10:05:00.000Z	mezquitale	jack5463	can you give me the url of the video so I can go and see if I am able to see it myself?
2010-02-09T10:11:00.000Z	jack5463	mezquitale	this one doesn't work - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiLveKVQjbY This one works - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCPQubIE2Hk&feature=rec-LGOUT-real_rn-3r-2-HM
2010-02-09T10:17:00.000Z	jack5463	mezquitale	do you have an idea why one would work and the other will not?
2010-02-09T10:20:00.000Z	mezquitale	jack5463	it has to do with the flash software, try other drivers
2010-02-09T10:21:00.000Z	mezquitale	jack5463	you have 64 bit machine?
2010-02-09T10:22:00.000Z	jack5463	mezquitale	32 bit
2010-02-09T10:23:00.000Z	mezquitale	jack5463	here's your answer, it's a known bug: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gtk+2.0/+bug/410407\
2010-02-09T10:24:00.000Z	jack5463	mezquitale	the url isn't right.. says - Thereâ€™s no page with this address in Launchpad.
2010-02-09T10:24:00.000Z	mezquitale	jack5463	you have compiz enabled?

2010-02-09T10:56:00.000Z	jack5463	mezquitale	 Where do i find flashplugin-nonfree / flashplugin-installer so I can remove it?
2010-02-09T11:43:00.000Z	jack5463	mezquitale	I deleted swfdec flash player and installed adobe and now flash works.
2010-02-09T11:49:00.000Z	mezquitale	jack5463	awesome! did you follow the bug report in launchpad?  Now if you have anymore issues with ubuntu tackle them one by one and pretty soon your rig will be up and running without a glitch!
