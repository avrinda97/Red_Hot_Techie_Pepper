I get grub boot error,  no such file ......... ive installed it to the /boot parition /dev/sdd2 and the actual drive in over a number of formats --> /dev/sdd doesnt work either
2009-11-16T07:44:00.000Z	ChogyDan	hyperstream	what is your drive setup?
2009-11-16T07:49:00.000Z	hyperstream	ChogyDan	i have 2 IDE's and 2 Sata and one USB External Hard Drive(1TB) , when i go through the install process i click advanced and tell it to install the boot loader onto the 1TB drive, ive also one time made a /boot partition, and tried to install grub onto that with the advanced menu just before it copy's the files and installs the OS
2009-11-16T07:50:00.000Z	ChogyDan	hyperstream	you need to install grub to the drive that the bios will boot
2009-11-16T07:50:00.000Z	hyperstream		yes i tell me bios to boot my 1TB drive
2009-11-16T07:50:00.000Z	hyperstream		and i get that error, grub erro boot somethign.. unable to find file ...
2009-11-16T07:51:00.000Z	hyperstream	ChogyDan	then just sits at grub rescue>
2009-11-16T07:51:00.000Z	ChogyDan	hyperstream	hmm, so you install grub on the external drive?  and then have the /boot partition on another drive?
2009-11-16T07:51:00.000Z	hyperstream		no the /boot partition in on the External Drive as well
2009-11-16T07:52:00.000Z	hyperstream		i have like this: 10gig /boot (ext4) | 100gig / (ext4) | 4gig swaparea
2009-11-16T07:53:00.000Z	hyperstream	ChogyDan	i have tried installing to 10gig /boot and with out even having a /boot (just 100gig /root) and install to / partition.
2009-11-16T07:53:00.000Z	hyperstream	ChogyDan	also it is the first partition(s) on the drive.
2009-11-16T07:53:00.000Z	ChogyDan	hyperstream	and you get the same error?
2009-11-16T07:54:00.000Z	hyperstream		actually no,  without the /boot partition, i was installing the bootloader to the Ext Hard Drive /dev/sdd , and i was getting unknown file system, but with the /boot partition and installing the boot loader to that i get cant find file
2009-11-16T07:55:00.000Z	hyperstream	ChogyDan	ive even booted into live cd, and had a look at the 10gig boot partition, it has a grub directory, but no menu.lst or anything like that
