2007-05-05T14:07:00.000Z	r2d4		I have the open source drivers installed for my ATI Radeon 9600 in Feisty. Is it OK to just use Envy to install the proprietary drivers? Or should I do something else first like manually remove the open drivers?
2007-05-05T14:08:00.000Z	ziroday	r2d4	ati dont support that card envy wont work
2007-05-05T14:09:00.000Z	r2d4	ziroday	Hmm. It didn't work now like you say. But I am pretty sure I installed fine an year ago.
2007-05-05T14:09:00.000Z	r2d4	ziroday	I manually installed the driver then.
2007-05-05T14:09:00.000Z	ziroday	r2d4	lemme gues  bad resolution
2007-05-05T14:10:00.000Z	r2d4	ziroday	yes.
2007-05-05T14:11:00.000Z	ziroday	r2d4	i ahve the same card and bassically with the new kernel ati only updated some of the drivers the others were left in the dust. So only the open source drivers or a older distro
2007-05-05T14:11:00.000Z	r2d4	ziroday	I am just unhappy with the performance of Beryl and wondered if the closed drivers would help.
2007-05-05T14:12:00.000Z	r2d4	ziroday	I guess I should just leave Beryl till I upgrade.
2007-05-05T14:12:00.000Z	r2d4	ziroday	How is compositing for you?
2007-05-05T14:12:00.000Z	ziroday	r2d4	you can try but envy will give you a module mismatch error
2007-05-05T14:12:00.000Z	ziroday	r2d4	as long as i dont go overboard pretty god
2007-05-05T14:13:00.000Z	r2d4	ziroday	Is the default effects - not overboard? or did you tweak down?
2007-05-05T14:13:00.000Z	ziroday	r2d4	default was fine
2007-05-05T14:14:00.000Z	ziroday	r2d4	all i learnt was never ever buy ati
2007-05-05T14:14:00.000Z	r2d4	ziroday	My CPU is Athlon XP 2000+. Pretty old. Does Beryl make a difference on CPU or just the GPU?
2007-05-05T14:14:00.000Z	ziroday	r2d4	not sure you can always go to #beryl and ask
2007-05-05T14:15:00.000Z	r2d4	ziroday	Ah! Will do that.
