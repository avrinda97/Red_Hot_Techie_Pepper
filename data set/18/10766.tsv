2006-12-25T16:15:00.000Z	protocol1		Is there a reason why I lost my sound?
2006-12-25T16:15:00.000Z	protocol1		I just reboot and its gone?
2006-12-25T16:16:00.000Z	protocol1		nope

2006-12-25T16:16:00.000Z	protocol1		its not mutes either...I checked that
2006-12-25T16:16:00.000Z	protocol1		muted*
2006-12-25T16:17:00.000Z	protocol1		the cables are plugged in properly....and the sounds do work in windows
2006-12-25T16:17:00.000Z	protocol1		so its not a hardware issue
2006-12-25T16:18:00.000Z	protocol1		and it has worked before...I know that for a fact
