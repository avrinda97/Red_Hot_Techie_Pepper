2006-05-11T07:35:00.000Z	starman		example
2006-05-11T07:35:00.000Z	starman		you can run compiz like this
2006-05-11T07:35:00.000Z	starman		compiz --replace gconf wobbly ... etc
2006-05-11T07:35:00.000Z	starman		well gconf is a plugin
2006-05-11T07:35:00.000Z	starman		if I omit it then it works
2006-05-11T07:36:00.000Z	starman		it sometimes complains depending on the order of the plugins
2006-05-11T07:36:00.000Z	starman		which are actually listed under /usr/lib/compiz
2006-05-11T07:37:00.000Z	starman		It is a pity I dont get that cool wobblying effect but this still has some nice things like the cube, or the moving windows. No switcher working, it may have something to do with key bindings, etc
2006-05-11T07:37:00.000Z	starman		you guys really think Intel duo is 32bit?
2006-05-11T07:38:00.000Z	starman		that is a crap
2006-05-11T07:38:00.000Z	dli	starman	it's called "intel core duo" :(
2006-05-11T07:39:00.000Z	dli	starman	want 64 bit dual core, wait untill July
2006-05-11T07:40:00.000Z	dli	starman	or May the 9th, turion x2 from amd, 64 bit, and way better than "core duo"
2006-05-11T07:40:00.000Z	dli	starman	I heard turion x2 will be cheaper than core duo
2006-05-11T07:40:00.000Z	starman	dli	the problem is that almost no one sells amd laptops
2006-05-11T07:41:00.000Z	dli	starman	asus, fuji, hp/compaq
2006-05-11T07:41:00.000Z	dli	starman	amd usually goes nvidia
2006-05-11T07:42:00.000Z	dli	starman	turion64 from hp/compaq is affordable, but not of the good quality as asus/fuji
