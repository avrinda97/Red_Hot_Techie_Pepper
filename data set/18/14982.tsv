2005-11-27T11:55:00.000Z	nalioth	nmsa	if it is a system you dont use xorg on, you can use bum to disable from starting up
2005-11-27T11:55:00.000Z	nmsa	nalioth	bum ?
2005-11-27T11:56:00.000Z	nalioth	nmsa	check your private messages

2005-12-15T09:20:00.000Z	nmsa	nalioth	what is XXXXXX in a pgp key sig how do I find the key I'm having ... --list-keys tells me 1024D/xxxxxxx; is the xxxxxxxx the key ?
2005-12-15T09:22:00.000Z	nalioth	nmsa	the 8 digits you see are called your "key ID", and that is what you use in place of XXXXXXXX
