2006-06-16T13:24:00.000Z	sysdoc		Sorry to ask again, but not finding what I'm looking for in the wiki. anyone have a link to a grub restore technique for a 2 linux install??
2006-06-16T13:25:00.000Z	ompaul	sysdoc	help.ubuntu.com and wiki.ubuntu.com
2006-06-24T12:22:00.000Z	ompaul	sysdoc	open gedit with gksudo gedit $var
2006-06-24T12:23:00.000Z	sysdoc	ompaul	Xlib: connection to ":0.0" refused by server
2006-06-24T12:23:00.000Z	ompaul	sysdoc	your not supposed to be root - you should run that command as an ordinary user and it will give superuser abilities to the program
2006-06-24T12:24:00.000Z	sysdoc	ompaul	worked like a charm in breezy. Not really concerned about being root...
2006-06-24T12:25:00.000Z	ompaul	sysdoc	it should not have - the refused is your user does not have access to the X session which is owned by someone else
2006-06-24T12:26:00.000Z	sysdoc	ompaul	your right, it did work as the user
2006-06-24T12:26:00.000Z	ompaul	sysdoc	root does not own the X session therefore access denied
2006-06-24T12:28:00.000Z	sysdoc	ompaul	that creates some interesting problems then. Navigating as root is necessary since I'm interested in getting my home dir that is on another partition and in Mandriva. Was able to just open what ever doc I wanted from the CLi as root previously in Breezy
2006-06-24T12:29:00.000Z	ompaul	sysdoc	no chmod -R username:username $partition and you can read it all
2006-06-24T12:30:00.000Z	sysdoc	ompaul	won't chat change the permissions when I'm in mandrive also?
2006-06-24T12:31:00.000Z	ompaul	sysdoc	sorry I did not realise you were dualbooting I thought you had committed to this
2006-06-24T12:32:00.000Z	ompaul	sysdoc	so I guess it is root and mc for you :-) nautilus and root are not a good combination
2006-06-24T12:32:00.000Z	sysdoc	ompaul	In the process of that at the moment...:)
2006-06-24T12:32:00.000Z	ompaul	sysdoc	I am outa here
2006-06-24T12:32:00.000Z	sysdoc	ompaul	l8r
2006-06-29T13:33:00.000Z	ompaul	sysdoc	apt-cache search linux | grep image | less
