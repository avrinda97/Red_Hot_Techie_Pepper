2008-05-16T16:59:00.000Z	Pici	microwaver	I've heard of this error before, I know theres a bug report associated with it, but I cannot seem to find it at the moment.
2008-05-16T17:02:00.000Z	microwaver	Pici	thanks for the effort. But has there been developed a fix on this bug?
2008-05-16T17:04:00.000Z	Pici	microwaver	Ah, found the bug page: https://launchpad.net/bugs/124406 , I'm not sure if theres a fix yet, sorry.
2008-05-16T17:05:00.000Z	microwaver	Pici	you don't need to apologise for that :-). it's not THAT often. It's just quite harrassing when alt tabbing between windows
2008-05-20T20:48:00.000Z	Pici	microwaver	the program is called gnome-terminal and it should be in your $PATH already
2008-05-20T20:51:00.000Z	microwaver	Pici	where can I found the gnome-terminal thingu then?
2008-05-21T20:12:00.000Z	Pici	microwaver	What happens when you right click them?
2008-05-21T20:13:00.000Z	microwaver	Pici	i'm talking about the launcher that normally is on the bottom panel (the one that lists the active programs)
2008-05-21T20:14:00.000Z	Pici	microwaver	It should have a 'handle' all the way on the left or right that you can click on.
2008-05-21T20:14:00.000Z	microwaver	Pici	because when I right click them now, i'm actually rightclicking the active application if you get my groove.
2008-05-21T20:15:00.000Z	microwaver	Pici	my god, thanks, it was just because the normal width of the thing is like 1000px, now it was like 50 pix, solved it, thanks Pici
