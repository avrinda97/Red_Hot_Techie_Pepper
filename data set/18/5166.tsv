2008-12-26T16:20:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	silv3r_m00n	the 'firestarter' package might be able to help with that.
2008-12-26T16:20:00.000Z	silv3r_m00n	onetinsoldier	let me check that
2008-12-26T16:29:00.000Z	silv3r_m00n	onetinsoldier	hischild: thanks that worked using firestarter
2008-12-26T16:29:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	silv3r_m00n	great! :-)
2008-12-26T16:29:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	silv3r_m00n	you're welcome
2008-12-26T16:30:00.000Z	silv3r_m00n	onetinsoldier	one more thing... looks like firestarter must run for this to work...so how can i start firestarter everytime ubuntu starts ?
2008-12-26T16:32:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	silv3r_m00n	now that you've installed it, i believe it runs everytime you start Ubuntu. however, i do get a 'failed' message about the firestart service starting wheni boot, but i am pretty certain it's running as soon at i enter x-windows(perhpas even sooner)
2008-12-26T16:33:00.000Z	silv3r_m00n	onetinsoldier	hmm...i configured in firestarter and internet connection sharing works fine... now i quit firestarter and it still works fine... so firestarter is not needed again ?
2008-12-26T16:34:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	silv3r_m00n	you probably shut the firewall down, but that probably does not disable the iptables port-forwarding
2008-12-26T16:35:00.000Z	silv3r_m00n	onetinsoldier	yeah the iptables once configured are there always and so it shud work from now on always...i think
2008-12-26T16:35:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	silv3r_m00n	yep, i think so too
2008-12-26T16:39:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	silv3r_m00n	ok,what hischild said. i misread your message, sorry. just quiting out of firestarter does not shut it down
2008-12-26T16:40:00.000Z	silv3r_m00n	onetinsoldier	thats all fine...
