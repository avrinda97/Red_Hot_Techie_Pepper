2005-10-16T12:29:00.000Z	Razor-X	cycom	AP Stats is a waste of time, i'm not going to waste my brains on that :P
2005-10-16T12:29:00.000Z	cycom	Razor-X	Amen brother!
2005-10-16T12:31:00.000Z	Razor-X	cycom	what are you going to major in?
2005-10-16T12:32:00.000Z	cycom	Razor-X	comp sci and mech engineering.  Hopefully dual major.  Robotics is the goal.
2005-10-16T12:32:00.000Z	Razor-X	cycom	doesen't everyone go into Comp Sci? :P
2005-10-16T12:32:00.000Z	Razor-X	cycom	my dad's a mechanical engineer, so, meh
2005-10-16T12:32:00.000Z	cycom	Razor-X	I love computers, and I love machines.  Robotics seems logical.
2005-10-16T12:32:00.000Z	Razor-X	cycom	boring stuff to me, hoping to major in pure mathematics, and if I feel so inclined as to pursue engineering, electrical engineering
2005-10-16T12:36:00.000Z	cycom	Razor-X	it's amazing how fast a hobby can turn into a career.
2005-10-16T12:36:00.000Z	Razor-X	cycom	meh
2005-10-16T12:36:00.000Z	Razor-X	cycom	well, I find math way more interesting than computers even, so... :P
2005-10-16T12:36:00.000Z	cycom	Razor-X	and I bet it was a hobby as well!
2005-10-16T12:38:00.000Z	Razor-X	cycom	of course it's a hobby
2005-10-16T12:38:00.000Z	Razor-X	cycom	I pursue higher math than my school's crappy career-based system allows me to take
2005-10-16T12:39:00.000Z	cycom	Razor-X	which is why it should be your career!
2005-10-18T09:54:00.000Z	Razor-X	cycom	because people are excited?
2005-10-18T09:54:00.000Z	cycom	Razor-X	well don't give us these silly random intervals :) 9 minutes! 6 minutes, 22 seconds, 6 and a half miliseconds!
2005-10-18T09:55:00.000Z	Razor-X	cycom	I did that for Knife of Dreams, i'm not that excited about Ubuntu :P
