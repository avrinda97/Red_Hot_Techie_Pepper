2011-01-17T02:09:00.000Z	BelkinUSB		hi all, do you think I should be able to run Ubuntu/xubuntu on a portable with a P3 900 Mhz processor, 250 Mb RAM and
2011-01-17T02:09:00.000Z	bencahill	BelkinUSB	I would run a lighter version, like xubuntu or lubuntu, or go for a lighter distro altogether
2011-01-17T02:09:00.000Z	bencahill	BelkinUSB	see this: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/SystemRequirements
2011-01-17T02:10:00.000Z	bencahill	BelkinUSB	yes, but it should run great if you use something like lubuntu, which uses lxde
2011-01-17T02:27:00.000Z	bencahill	BelkinUSB	you could do that with wubi, but not normally
2011-01-17T02:27:00.000Z	bencahill	BelkinUSB	you need one for windows and two for linux, assuming you need swap (which you probably do)
2011-01-17T02:28:00.000Z	BelkinUSB	bencahill	unfortunately wubi does not work for me...not enough RAM
2011-01-17T02:28:00.000Z	bencahill	BelkinUSB	not enough ram? :-/
2011-01-17T02:30:00.000Z	bencahill	BelkinUSB	oh, then I would use lubuntu or a lighter distro
2011-01-17T02:33:00.000Z	BelkinUSB	bencahill	if I decide to install on the same partition alongside XP on my other laptop (2Gb ram, P4 2,6 Mhz) , would it run ok?
2011-01-17T02:33:00.000Z	bencahill	BelkinUSB	no, that would be impossible :-?
2011-01-17T02:43:00.000Z	BelkinUSB	bencahill	finisched installing all the lxde-desktop environment.. what now. do I have to reboot?
2011-01-17T03:01:00.000Z	BelkinUSB	bencahill	Lubuntu is cool but still a little on the slow side on my old piece of junk
2011-01-17T03:02:00.000Z	bencahill	BelkinUSB	you might want to try puppy linux or slitaz
2011-01-17T03:03:00.000Z	BelkinUSB	bencahill	ActionParsnip puppy ? is that part of the ubuntu family or its a completely different distro altogether?
2011-01-17T03:04:00.000Z	bencahill	BelkinUSB	completely different, but lucid can use ubuntu repos, as ActionParsnip said
2011-01-17T03:06:00.000Z	bencahill	BelkinUSB	browsing the internet will probably be the same no matter what os you use (it would depend on the browser), although I could be wrong
2011-01-17T03:14:00.000Z	bencahill	BelkinUSB	cya :)
