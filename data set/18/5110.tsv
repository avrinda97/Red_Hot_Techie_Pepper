2009-06-08T21:49:00.000Z	linnoob		Hi - This is a dual boot partitioned windows/Intrepid installed running Gnome desktop - I want to read the Windows partition - I installed following - sudo apt-get install ntfs-config - Is this all I need - Or do I need to install Samba as well ? ?
2009-06-08T21:50:00.000Z	dalekleader	linnoob	you only need to configure your fstab file
2009-06-08T21:50:00.000Z	linnoob	dalekleader	Not sure how to to do that.... Point me in the right direction ?

2009-06-08T21:52:00.000Z	dalekleader	linnoob	you will need to identify the partion number of your windows partition.  Do you know how to do that?
2009-06-08T21:53:00.000Z	linnoob	dalekleader	I already have Windows on 1st partition - Just want to be able to get files from this partition to copy to my Intrepid folders.
2009-06-08T21:53:00.000Z	dalekleader	linnoob	so you only want to temporarily mount the windows partition?
2009-06-08T21:53:00.000Z	linnoob	dalekleader	Yup
2009-06-08T21:54:00.000Z	dalekleader	linnoob	ok, first open a terminal.  Type sudo fdisk -l
2009-06-08T21:54:00.000Z	linnoob	dalekleader	ok
2009-06-08T21:55:00.000Z	dalekleader	linnoob	you should see one of the partitions as ntfs file system?
2009-06-08T21:55:00.000Z	linnoob	dalekleader	yup - If you like I can post screen shot ?
2009-06-08T21:56:00.000Z	dalekleader	linnoob	ok, no need, just make a mental note of the partition number  should be something like sda1
2009-06-08T21:57:00.000Z	linnoob	dalekleader	ok - yea it's sda1
2009-06-08T21:57:00.000Z	dalekleader		now, you will want to make a folder to mount too.  type sudo mkdir /media/windows
2009-06-08T22:00:00.000Z	linnoob	dalekleader	Hey - I already got it - Went to < Places/Computer - Clicked on DSK1_VOL1 and asked permission - entered password and let in to copy files - THanks for help.
