2009-06-19T00:53:00.000Z	bsl		can anyone help me setup HW RAID5 on ubuntu server
2009-06-19T00:54:00.000Z	erUSUL	bsl	it it is HW raid it should be set up in the bios of the card; shouldn't it ?
2009-06-19T00:55:00.000Z	bsl	erUSUL	the bios says its setup, but when I install ubuntu server it splits the RAID members up
2009-06-19T00:55:00.000Z	bsl	erUSUL	so I'm trying to partition it from within ubuntu
2009-06-19T00:55:00.000Z	erUSUL	bsl	the raid card is supported by linux ?
2009-06-19T00:55:00.000Z	bsl	erUSUL	I assume so, its a GIGABYTE mobo, which is fairly new
2009-06-19T00:56:00.000Z	bsl	erUSUL	support RAID0,1,5,10
2009-06-19T00:56:00.000Z	erUSUL	bsl	so it is not really hardware driver is the fakeraid typical of consumer mobos ... like intel matrix...
2009-06-19T00:58:00.000Z	erUSUL	bsl	it is raid implemented in the bios software... if you plan to use only linux on the machine it is better to sue linux's software raid implementation
2009-06-19T00:58:00.000Z	erUSUL	bsl	*use*
2009-06-19T00:59:00.000Z	bsl	erUSUL	I wont take any CPU hit?  It's a home server, only 1.8GHz Celeron
2009-06-19T00:59:00.000Z	erUSUL	bsl	the same hit as using the one in the bios... both are software and use main cpu
2009-06-19T01:00:00.000Z	erUSUL	bsl	just linux raid is better supported (obiously) and is faster on most situations
2009-06-19T01:01:00.000Z	erUSUL	bsl	read the first two paragraphs here https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FakeRaidHowto
2009-06-19T01:02:00.000Z	bsl	erUSUL	I havn't read the wiki yet, but dmraid is the prog I'm looking at
2009-06-19T01:02:00.000Z	bsl	erUSUL	I was about to go ahead and set it up with dmraid, but i kept seeing the phrase "fakeraid" and I was still under the impression I had HW raid
2009-06-19T01:03:00.000Z	erUSUL	bsl	real HW raid card with memory processor batteries cost the same as a whole computer...
2009-06-19T01:04:00.000Z	bsl	erUSUL	thanks for the info, I'll see what I can do
