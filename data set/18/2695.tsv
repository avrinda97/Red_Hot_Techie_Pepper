2011-03-12T04:54:00.000Z	W43372		my clock is five hours behind even though I'm in the proper timezone.
2011-03-12T04:55:00.000Z	th0r	W43372	you probably have the hw clock set wrong
2011-03-12T05:00:00.000Z	W43372	th0r	The clock on the panel is five hours behind, but when I click on it, it shows the correct time zone, city, and even the correct time, but the clock above it is wrong
2011-03-12T05:01:00.000Z	th0r	W43372	there is a hw clock and when you installed linux you probably told it to set the hw clock to local time. Then on bootup the system tries to adjust that time for the local timezone. I think it will fix the problem if you tell ubuntu to set the hw clock to utc
2011-03-12T05:01:00.000Z	W43372	th0r	how do I do that?
2011-03-12T05:02:00.000Z	th0r	W43372	not sure....want me to google it for you?
2011-03-12T05:02:00.000Z	W43372	th0r	sure, that would be cool.

2011-04-29T02:12:00.000Z	th0r	W43372	whining helps alot
2011-07-22T02:42:00.000Z	th0r	W43372	use wipe to erase the files
2011-07-22T02:42:00.000Z	W43372	th0r	how do I do that?
2011-07-22T02:43:00.000Z	th0r	W43372	use synaptic to install wipe, then open a terminal and type 'man wipe'
2011-07-22T02:43:00.000Z	W43372	th0r	and that will make deleted files completely unrecoverable?
2011-07-22T02:43:00.000Z	th0r	W43372	read the man page regarding that
2011-07-22T02:45:00.000Z	W43372	th0r	where can I find this man page?
2011-07-22T02:45:00.000Z	th0r	W43372	like I said before, open a terminal and type 'man wipe'
