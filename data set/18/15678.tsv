2007-12-16T22:57:00.000Z	vasser		i need some help with my gfx card
2007-12-16T22:57:00.000Z	vasser		i have managed to get it working with X, but when i reboot, i get low graphics mode
2007-12-16T22:57:00.000Z	vasser		i have a 8800gt
2007-12-16T22:58:00.000Z	vasser		and it seems to work only with the beta drivers of nvidia
2007-12-16T22:58:00.000Z	vasser		(for now)
2007-12-16T22:58:00.000Z	Dr_willis	vasser	 Hmm.. My 8800 works good.
2007-12-16T22:58:00.000Z	vasser		mine too, but it somehow forgets things when i boot
2007-12-16T22:58:00.000Z	Dr_willis		darn 8800's seem to have some.. quirks.
2007-12-16T22:59:00.000Z	vasser		ah
2007-12-16T22:59:00.000Z	vasser		right

2007-12-16T22:59:00.000Z	vasser	wols	thanks
2007-12-16T22:59:00.000Z	Dr_willis		You have 2 spleens right? :)
2007-12-16T23:00:00.000Z	vasser	wols	forgot all about the module
2007-12-16T23:00:00.000Z	vasser		another issue: how do i know which drive is (hd0) and which is (hd1) ?
2007-12-16T23:01:00.000Z	vasser		(in grub, that is)
2007-12-16T23:01:00.000Z	Dr_willis	vasser	 they way you describe the video issue. sounds more like its a bug in the nvdia drivers.   as for hd0 and hd1, you can also check the /boot/grub/device.map and see what grub thinks they are.
