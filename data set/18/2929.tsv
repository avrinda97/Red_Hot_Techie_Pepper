2010-01-28T01:08:00.000Z	Trek		I got a question.  Is it possible to install normal 9.04 Desktop Edition to a netbook?  I'm wondering compatibility, forget about installation methods.
2010-01-28T01:09:00.000Z	mAriachi	Trek	you can try out the distro before installing it
2010-01-28T01:09:00.000Z	mAriachi	Trek	if everything works, go for it
2010-01-28T01:10:00.000Z	mAriachi	Trek	if you are worried about compatibility
2010-01-28T01:10:00.000Z	mAriachi	Trek	just boot from usb, and select Try ubuntu without any change
2010-01-28T01:12:00.000Z	mAriachi	Trek	dont be a stranger when you try it out, update us :D
2010-01-28T01:13:00.000Z	mAriachi	Trek	i would also recommend trying out Ubuntu Netbook Remix, i used to use it, not a bad alternative at all
2010-01-28T01:14:00.000Z	Trek	mAriachi	i've used it before on a friend's netbook, not a fan of the initial interface, took me a few hours to figure out how to switch to the normal GNOME interface
2010-01-28T01:14:00.000Z	Trek	mAriachi	i much prefer normal Desktop edition
2010-01-28T01:15:00.000Z	mAriachi	Trek	haha, i know, but on the other hand, in my opinion it uses the small monitor area much beter
2010-01-28T01:16:00.000Z	Trek	mAriachi	i've effectively run 9.04 Desktop edition on a LiveUSB from an Acer netbook before
2010-01-28T01:16:00.000Z	Trek	mAriachi	i've personally got an HP mini tho
2010-01-28T01:17:00.000Z	mAriachi	Trek	me, personally, i am using the Xfce desktop, Xubuntu karmic, and i absolutely love it :D, and i have a pretty good conf for a lappy
2010-01-28T01:19:00.000Z	Trek	mAriachi	I've got a desktop box running Ubuntu Desktop Edition plus some server software (I like GUI interfaces, lol), a Laptop (that I'm using right now) running Ubuntu Desktop Edition with SSH capabilities installed, and a Windows netbook (at the moment its Windows) that I recently bought out-of-the-box and it has over 60 updates for it right now :P
2010-01-28T01:20:00.000Z	mAriachi	Trek	you just got it? congrats and may it serve you well :D
2010-01-28T01:20:00.000Z	Trek	mAriachi	yeah, I just bought it today :)
2010-01-28T02:12:00.000Z	Trek	mAriachi	and others, I got the LiveUSB running on the netbook (took long enough to install lol), i'm waiting for it to load.
2010-01-28T02:15:00.000Z	Trek	mAriachi	oskude, update: the LiveUSB loads flawlessly on the netbook, and its a LiveUSB of Ubuntu Desktop Edition 9.04
