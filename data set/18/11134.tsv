2006-12-19T12:44:00.000Z	klip	TurtleBoots	Let's try the newer drivers first: sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx
2006-12-19T12:44:00.000Z	TurtleBoots	klip	Thankyou very much! :-D Trying...
2006-12-19T12:44:00.000Z	klip	TurtleBoots	After the installation of the driver you need to enable it.
2006-12-19T12:45:00.000Z	klip	TurtleBoots	for Edgy: sudo nvidia-xconfig, for Dapper and older: sudo nvidia-glx-config enable
2006-12-19T12:45:00.000Z	TurtleBoots	klip	sweetness!!!!
2006-12-19T12:45:00.000Z	klip	TurtleBoots	After that, you need to restart the PC; an nvidia-screen will welcome you before GDM starts. That means it was successful.
2006-12-19T12:46:00.000Z	TurtleBoots	klip	perfecto!!! I will try this and let you know :-)
2006-12-19T12:46:00.000Z	klip	TurtleBoots	If X won't start, edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf section driver. Change "nvidia" to "nv"
2006-12-19T12:48:00.000Z	TurtleBoots	klip	can we do private chat so I Can paste the error... its along the lines of... Error: your X configuration has been altered.
2006-12-19T12:49:00.000Z	klip	TurtleBoots	 Hmm,  this is not unusual. It should say that you have to restart X. I remember having that message, too.
2006-12-19T12:49:00.000Z	klip	TurtleBoots	But I am not 100% sure.
