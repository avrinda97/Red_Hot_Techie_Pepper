2006-12-10T07:46:00.000Z	gizmo_the_great1		hi. I am trying to get Ubuntu to see my MP3 player. When I execute lsusb I get the following entry : 'Bus 002 Device 004: ID 10d6:1100 Actions Semiconductor Co., Ltd MPMan MP-Ki 128 MP3 Player/Recorder' listed. But it does not pop up as a drive I can access?
2006-12-10T07:46:00.000Z	frogzoo	gizmo_the_great1	have you tried amarok?
2006-12-10T07:46:00.000Z	gizmo_the_great1	frogzoo	no - what is that?
2006-12-17T08:40:00.000Z	frogzoo	gizmo_the_great1	what's the line in fstab ?
2006-12-17T08:41:00.000Z	gizmo_the_great1	frogzoo	let me go and look
2006-12-17T08:41:00.000Z	gizmo_the_great1	frogzoo	there is not an entry preent. It was auto mounted during boot up.
2006-12-17T08:41:00.000Z	gizmo_the_great1	frogzoo	is that the problem?
2006-12-17T08:43:00.000Z	gizmo_the_great1	frogzoo	according to fstab, there i no entry for mounting the external drive. It auto mounts either during boot up (if plugged in) or when plugged in mid-session. is that the problem?
2006-12-17T08:43:00.000Z	frogzoo	gizmo_the_great1	what does the 'mount' line for it report?
2006-12-17T08:43:00.000Z	gizmo_the_great1	frogzoo	i will go and see
2006-12-17T08:44:00.000Z	gizmo_the_great1	frogzoo	It says this : '/dev/sda1 on /media/LACIE type vfat (rw,nosuid,nodev,quiet,shortname=mixed,uid=1000,gid=1000,umask=077,iocharset=utf8)'
2006-12-17T08:47:00.000Z	gizmo_the_great1	frogzoo	Mount reports the following : '/dev/sda1 on /media/LACIE type vfat (rw,nosuid,nodev,quiet,shortname=mixed,uid=1000,gid=1000,umask=077,iocharset=utf8)'. Is it something to do with the 'nosuid', or the 'uid=1000' entry?
2006-12-17T08:47:00.000Z	frogzoo	gizmo_the_great1	what does 'id' say?
2006-12-17T08:47:00.000Z	gizmo_the_great1	frogzoo	id reports 'uid=1000(ted) gid=1000(ted) groups=4(adm),20(dialout),24(cdrom),25(floppy),29(audio),30(dip),44(video),46(plugdev),104(lpadmin),105(scanner),106(admin),1000(ted)'
2006-12-17T08:49:00.000Z	gizmo_the_great1	frogzoo	so I think that means that the mount is assigning me as the autorised person to use it? As both report UID as 1000, and 1000 = ted?
2006-12-17T08:49:00.000Z	frogzoo	gizmo_the_great1	I think the umask should be 4 digits (ie umask=0077) - I'd try giving the disk a line in /etc/fstab (with the noauto option)
2006-12-17T08:50:00.000Z	gizmo_the_great1	frogzoo	I will have a go at that and let you know. Give me 5 :-)
2006-12-17T09:36:00.000Z	gizmo_the_great1	frogzoo	not sure if u still there, but in the end I just re-formatted the drive and recopied the data to it, and now it's less the wastebacket junk. Was just taking me too long to do a simple copy backup procedure.
