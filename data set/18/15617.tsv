2005-02-21T09:32:00.000Z	heliolith		hello all; I'm having a hard time installing on my laptop, in the first few screens the installer locks up and won't let me progress.  I found similar issues on the forums but no solution short of the "NET install", after making a bootable floppy.  Is there a simpler to initiate an internet based installation than the one described in the forums that anyone here knows of?  I really want Ubuntu on my laptop!
