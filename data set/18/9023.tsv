2008-06-17T09:22:00.000Z	DrFrankenstein		hi. so here's my problem: after Windows decided to screw its NTFS header, I ran a fixmbr/fixboot on it. obviously, this destroyed GRUB. so I tried by many ways reinstalling GRUB, however it seems to refuse to see my ext3 partition.
2008-06-17T09:23:00.000Z	Agent_bob	DrFrankenstein	are you sure you still have an ext2 partition ?
2008-06-17T09:24:00.000Z	DrFrankenstein	Agent_bob	I can mount it from the live CD yes
2008-06-17T09:25:00.000Z	Agent_bob	DrFrankenstein	in the live CD mount it on /mnt  and then run    sudo grub-install --root-directory=/mnt /dev/sda
2008-06-17T09:26:00.000Z	Agent_bob	DrFrankenstein	ok hda then
2008-06-17T09:27:00.000Z	Agent_bob	DrFrankenstein	you can look at /proc/partitions  to see what the disk address it
2008-06-17T09:29:00.000Z	DrFrankenstein	Agent_bob	done, I'll be back if it still doesn't boot.
2008-06-17T09:30:00.000Z	Agent_bob	DrFrankenstein	i'll expect you when i see you comming
2008-06-17T10:01:00.000Z	Agent_bob	DrFrankenstein	what error ?
2008-06-17T10:01:00.000Z	DrFrankenstein	Agent_bob	 black screen with blinking cursor. probably what remains of Windows' boot loader
2008-06-17T10:03:00.000Z	Agent_bob	DrFrankenstein	no grub error at all ?   no 99 99 99 99 or  17   or nothing ?
2008-06-17T10:04:00.000Z	DrFrankenstein	Agent_bob	nothing.
2008-06-17T10:07:00.000Z	Agent_bob	DrFrankenstein	try installing from a grub shell maybe
2008-06-17T10:08:00.000Z	Agent_bob	DrFrankenstein	you can run grub as a shell just like you would bash or tcsh    it hs command line editing and simple help messages with tab completion.
2008-06-17T10:10:00.000Z	Agent_bob	DrFrankenstein	you were trying the extended partition not a logical drive within it...  that happens
2008-06-17T10:10:00.000Z	DrFrankenstein	Agent_bob	 I was trying (hd0,5) 15 minutes earlier too, and it was saying "no such partition"
2008-06-17T10:11:00.000Z	Agent_bob	DrFrankenstein	yeay for udev
2008-06-17T10:12:00.000Z	DrFrankenstein	Agent_bob	yay. alright, well, thanks for the heip anyway.
