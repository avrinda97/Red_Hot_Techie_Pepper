2012-02-19T09:53:00.000Z	hydrox24	god-zotac	what exactly is your multimedia device?
2012-02-19T09:54:00.000Z	hydrox24	god-zotac	interesting, and xfce sees this as a keyboard?
2012-02-19T09:55:00.000Z	hydrox24	god-zotac	OK, and is the issue that when you press them, nothing happens to the volume?
2012-02-19T09:56:00.000Z	hydrox24	god-zotac	I have multimedia keys on my laptop mapped to those and they work great!
2012-02-19T09:57:00.000Z	hydrox24	god-zotac	why do you need to have a script mapped, can't you just map the keys straight to XF86AudioLower etc
2012-02-19T09:59:00.000Z	hydrox24	god-zotac	does it work fine when you map it straight to the XF86Audio thing
2012-02-19T10:03:00.000Z	hydrox24	god-zotac	sorry, gotta get this straight, so pressing the key on the headset does the XF86Audio thing butn that isn't what you want? Or does it not do anything?
2012-02-19T10:06:00.000Z	hydrox24	god-zotac	very strange indeed
2012-02-19T10:07:00.000Z	hydrox24	god-zotac	Well, that issue is strange indeed, what about trying a different WM (It probably wont' change it so fon
2012-02-19T10:07:00.000Z	hydrox24	god-zotac	Well, that issue is strange indeed, what about trying a different WM (It probably wont' change it so don't go to too much trouble)
2012-02-19T10:08:00.000Z	hydrox24	god-zotac	that's fine, I understand
2012-02-19T10:09:00.000Z	hydrox24	god-zotac	doing now.
2012-02-19T10:19:00.000Z	hydrox24	god-zotac	nice!
2012-02-19T10:19:00.000Z	hydrox24	god-zotac	I'm proud of you ^.^
2012-02-19T10:32:00.000Z	hydrox24	god-zotac	no sorry, missed it
2012-02-19T10:35:00.000Z	hydrox24	god-zotac	nice job, awesome script man!
2012-02-19T10:37:00.000Z	hydrox24	god-zotac	Unfortunately,  I use earphones which have the earphone output part for the iphone (3 sections to the 3.5mm jack)
2012-02-19T10:38:00.000Z	hydrox24	god-zotac	yes, but I think that they are designed to output data to the iDevices, not normal laptop line-outs
