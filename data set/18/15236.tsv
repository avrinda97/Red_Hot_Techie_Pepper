2005-04-21T10:37:00.000Z	Debian-Newbie		Hi, I'm currently deciding between Debian and Ubuntu, can anyone point me to a page which has a comarison of both?
2005-04-21T10:39:00.000Z	Debian-Newbie		westyw: Ok, I need to decide, where can I read a good article comparing the differences in an objective way?
2005-04-21T10:40:00.000Z	Debian-Newbie		What I don't understand is: aren't the packages supposed to be compatible, since Ubuntu takes stuff from Debian?
2005-04-21T10:42:00.000Z	Debian-Newbie		Some guy told me that you couldn't use XFCE with Ubuntu because Ubuntu only had Gnome and KDE(Kubuntu), is that true? Why can't I use the debian XFCE package for example?
2005-04-21T10:43:00.000Z	Debian-Newbie		OK,
2005-04-21T10:43:00.000Z	Debian-Newbie		So, what is confusing for me is that I don't understand what is the difference? I mean, can't I just use all the Ubuntu packages in Debian an vice-versa?
2005-04-21T10:44:00.000Z	SuperQ	Debian-Newbie	not a good idea
2005-04-21T10:44:00.000Z	SuperQ	Debian-Newbie	you can, but you have to be very careful
2005-04-21T10:44:00.000Z	SuperQ	Debian-Newbie	basicaly, don't try unless you're a developer
2005-04-21T10:55:00.000Z	SuperQ	Debian-Newbie	why would you need to use non-ubuntu packages anyway?
2005-04-21T10:55:00.000Z	SuperQ	Debian-Newbie	everything in Sid plus some is in universe
2005-04-21T10:55:00.000Z	SuperQ	Debian-Newbie	libc changes
2005-04-21T10:56:00.000Z	Debian-Newbie	SuperQ	I'm worried that some packages I might need are only in Debian and not in Ubuntu.
2005-04-21T10:56:00.000Z	SuperQ	Debian-Newbie	pacakage dependancy changes
2005-04-21T10:56:00.000Z	SuperQ	Debian-Newbie	don't worry about that
2005-04-21T10:56:00.000Z	SuperQ	Debian-Newbie	everything you need will be in ubuntu
2005-04-21T10:56:00.000Z	SuperQ	Debian-Newbie	enable universe and multiverse
2005-04-21T10:56:00.000Z	SuperQ	Debian-Newbie	that's all it takes
