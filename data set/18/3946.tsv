2009-07-01T10:32:00.000Z	nanotube	Sava	why is google returning anything about your xorg? what does your xorg return? :)
2009-07-01T10:33:00.000Z	Sava	nanotube	i googled "Desktop effects + Dual monitors", and few of the results mention about that :)
2009-07-01T10:34:00.000Z	nanotube	Sava	yea, but what happens when you actually do try to enable desktop effects with dual monitor? works, no? any errors?
2009-07-01T10:35:00.000Z	nanotube	Sava	how much video ram do you have, and what is the total resolution of your two desktops?
2009-07-01T10:36:00.000Z	Sava	nanotube	video takes about 512Mb of my 4GB, the max resolution from "xrandr -q" is 2560 x 1024
2009-07-01T10:37:00.000Z	nanotube	Sava	what is the actual physical video memory that's on your graphics card?
2009-07-01T10:38:00.000Z	Sava	nanotube	.... im not sure. it's a ATI X3100
2009-07-01T10:39:00.000Z	nanotube	Sava	there's no such thing... there's an intel x3100 though. is that it?
2009-07-01T10:42:00.000Z	nanotube	Sava	hmm, well, i'm not sure if what i was thinking can be the case. for me, my vid card with 64m of ram just doesn't have enough ram to support the resolution of two monitors, i was thinking maybe it's a similar case for you... but it appears that the x3100 can address a decent chunk of ram...
2009-07-01T10:45:00.000Z	nanotube	Sava	from here: http://forum.compiz-fusion.org/showthread.php?t=6871 it seems that total resolution has to be less than 2048x2048 for compiz to work
2009-07-01T10:45:00.000Z	nanotube	Sava	so... try reducing resolution
2009-07-01T10:47:00.000Z	Sava	nanotube	... i was hoping for a better solution
2009-07-01T10:47:00.000Z	nanotube	Sava	heh, well... it's what i've got. maybe someone will find something better, but... hardware limitations are difficult to overcome :)
2009-07-01T10:48:00.000Z	Sava	nanotube	no of course :) thanks alot for the help, i really appreciate it
2009-07-01T10:49:00.000Z	nanotube	Sava	sorry :|
