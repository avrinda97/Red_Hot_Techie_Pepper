2005-09-07T12:56:00.000Z	alienacion		can you help me???
2005-09-07T12:56:00.000Z	alienacion		i can't understand why cin and cout don't work
2005-09-07T12:56:00.000Z	carthik	alienacion	welcome, i was kidding... whats it about>?
2005-09-07T12:57:00.000Z	alienacion		i'm including iostream
2005-09-07T12:57:00.000Z	alienacion		in my c++ file
2005-09-07T12:57:00.000Z	carthik	alienacion	apt-get install build-essentials perhaps?
2005-09-07T12:57:00.000Z	alienacion		yes carthik
2005-09-07T12:58:00.000Z	carthik	alienacion	if you have installed it, then cross-check with some downloaded source - easiest way out...
2005-09-07T12:58:00.000Z	carthik	alienacion	in other words, get a simple C++ source from the web, and try compiling it,a nd using it...
2005-09-07T12:59:00.000Z	alienacion	carthik	my prog simply print hello-world on stdout
2005-09-07T13:00:00.000Z	carthik	alienacion	you are obviously doing soething wrong so get a similar program source from the web and try it out - if it works - compare sources...
2005-09-07T13:00:00.000Z	alienacion		don't work
2005-09-07T13:00:00.000Z	alienacion		i can't compile nothing
2005-09-07T13:00:00.000Z	carthik	alienacion	you cant compile is differnt from cout not working
2005-09-07T13:01:00.000Z	alienacion		i can't compile beacuse cout undeclared
2005-09-07T13:01:00.000Z	carthik	alienacion	if you cant compile, you dont have the tools, fire up synaptic, search and install the pckages you need for ompiling whatever code it is...
2005-09-07T13:03:00.000Z	carthik	alienacion	all would have been easier had you tried what i said - search - download - try to compile...
