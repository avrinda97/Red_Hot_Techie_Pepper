2010-06-06T14:41:00.000Z	Zeu5	arand	hi it does not list my iDE though it is working just fine in ubuntu
2010-06-06T14:42:00.000Z	Zeu5	arand	i will be very grateful for any help given
2010-06-06T14:42:00.000Z	arand	Zeu5	Which application is it?
2010-06-06T14:42:00.000Z	Zeu5		komodo ide
2010-06-06T14:43:00.000Z	Zeu5		itis currently in a folder under /home/myusername/Komodo-IDE-5
2010-06-06T14:43:00.000Z	Zeu5		shd i move it to /opt?
2010-06-06T14:46:00.000Z	arand	Zeu5	Hmm, that I think should not make a difference there, I guess you might have to associate it manually, if you go to the list of programs again, and use a custom command, something like "/home/user/Komodo-IDE-5/komodo.bin" maybe?
2010-06-06T14:46:00.000Z	Zeu5	arand	the application is komodo ide. its currently in /home/myusername/Komodo-IDE-5 should i move i to /opt
2010-06-06T14:46:00.000Z	Zeu5	arand	sorry. just saw ur reply.
2010-06-06T14:48:00.000Z	Zeu5	arand	it worked with thhe custom command. thanks
2010-06-06T14:49:00.000Z	arand	Zeu5	:)  A bit strange that it failed to associate itself when it installed...
2010-06-06T14:51:00.000Z	Zeu5	arand	oh no i have to right click > open with everytime
2010-06-06T14:52:00.000Z	Zeu5	arand	it does not auto open with Komodo IDE everytime
2010-06-06T14:52:00.000Z	arand	Zeu5	Go to properties
2010-06-06T14:53:00.000Z	arand	Zeu5	for the file, you should be able to set the "default program for these types of files there from a list of alternatives, where your custom command should be present"
2010-06-06T14:54:00.000Z	arand	Zeu5	(right-click on the file - properties - open with)
2010-06-06T14:54:00.000Z	Zeu5	arand	there is no such thing. there is a remember this application checkbox. but that didnt work. i did it twice, and now komodo appears twice inside the list of applications. i got some applications appearing like 5 or 6 times in the list of possible applications
