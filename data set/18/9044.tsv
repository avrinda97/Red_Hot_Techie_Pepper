2008-10-02T05:19:00.000Z	bziobnic		is there any way to kill a zombie stuck in kernel mode without rebooting?
2008-10-02T05:19:00.000Z	unop	bziobnic	what's its state according to ps?
2008-10-02T05:21:00.000Z	bziobnic	unop	RN
2008-10-02T05:22:00.000Z	unop	bziobnic	it should respond to signals - have you sent it a SIGTERM ?
2008-10-02T05:23:00.000Z	bziobnic	unop	I've tried kill -9 repeatedly as root
2008-10-02T05:23:00.000Z	unop	bziobnic	you should never kill -9 .. infact a kill -9 will cause this behaviour
2008-10-02T05:24:00.000Z	bziobnic	unop	is there any way to recover now that I'm in this state?
2008-10-02T05:25:00.000Z	unop	bziobnic	are you sure the state is RN ?
2008-10-02T05:25:00.000Z	unop	bziobnic	and not D ?
2008-10-02T05:26:00.000Z	bziobnic	unop	10563 ?        RN   6156:51 gedit
2008-10-02T05:27:00.000Z	unop	bziobnic	strange .. have you tried xkill on the window? if it is still visible?
2008-10-02T05:27:00.000Z	bziobnic	unop	the window isn't visible
2008-10-02T05:28:00.000Z	unop	bziobnic	does  dmesg | tail -n 30  indicate anything might be wrong?
2008-10-02T05:30:00.000Z	bziobnic	unop	yes, there are tons of I/O errors - I think on an uncleanly unmounted usb thumb drive
2008-10-02T05:33:00.000Z	unop	bziobnic	right, that's what i thought - if it's indeed due to a unclean dismount - the best way is to reboot and then check the disk out (or step into runlevel 1 and dismount everything and carry out and fsck)
2008-10-02T05:33:00.000Z	bziobnic	unop	thanks
2008-10-02T05:34:00.000Z	unop	bziobnic	but i should think this is more than just a problem with an unclean dismount - reboot and monitor /var/log/{dmesg,debug} for sometime.
2008-10-02T05:36:00.000Z	bziobnic	unop	I will. This was a usb thumb drive that I inadvertently pulled out without unmounting. What stinks is that gedit is using 100% of one of my cores trying to read a file off of this drive and I've got another long running process that I really don't want to kill by rebooting
