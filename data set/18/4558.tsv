2010-09-10T16:26:00.000Z	mamooth		I'm trying to launch firefox from within a php page, for the purpose of printing to pdf. For instance, here a simple script which do that : http://pastie.org/1149825 . The problem is : When this script is launched from the command line, all is fine. But when I reach it through a LAMP server, nothing append, the command seems to abort immediately.
2010-09-10T16:27:00.000Z	iceroot	mamooth	dont do that, print directyl with php, dont call x-apps with php
2010-09-10T16:28:00.000Z	mamooth	iceroot	what are the limitations of calling X apps with php?
2010-09-10T16:28:00.000Z	iceroot	mamooth	security, ugly, php can do it directly, ugly and very ugly
2010-09-10T16:30:00.000Z	mamooth	iceroot	regring our requirements for generating pdf, firefox give actually the bests results. I can take care of security issues. What I need to know is: Is this technically possible?
2010-09-10T16:30:00.000Z	mamooth		regarding*
2010-09-10T16:31:00.000Z	iceroot	mamooth	sure it is
2010-09-10T16:33:00.000Z	mamooth	iceroot	do you have a idea of what cause the process to abort when I reach the script through apache?
2010-09-10T16:33:00.000Z	iceroot	mamooth	the error-log should tell you
2010-09-10T16:37:00.000Z	mamooth	iceroot	this is the problem, I have absolutely no feedback of what is happening, either in the log files or with return of the exec() function
2010-09-10T16:38:00.000Z	mamooth	iceroot	here's a debug script that isolate the problem: http://pastie.org/1149825
2010-09-10T16:38:00.000Z	mamooth		if I run it in the shell, all went fine.
2010-09-10T16:38:00.000Z	iceroot	mamooth	but you are not running it as the www-data user which apache is
2010-09-10T16:38:00.000Z	iceroot	mamooth	so i guess apache cant open the display
2010-09-10T16:39:00.000Z	iceroot	mamooth	and DONT run apache as another user!
2010-09-10T16:39:00.000Z	mamooth	iceroot	I use apache2-mpm-itk
2010-09-10T16:40:00.000Z	mamooth		so the process is assigned to the desired user at the fork time
2010-09-10T16:49:00.000Z	mamooth	iceroot	the problem come specifically from firefox. For example, I can run others X apps using the same display
