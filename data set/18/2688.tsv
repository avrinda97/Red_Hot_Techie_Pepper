2012-03-29T21:10:00.000Z	latenite		Hi folks, where can I find the official documentation for the "auto installer" the one with preseed.cfg. I want to read about to options on partitioning.
2012-03-29T21:12:00.000Z	sacarlson	latenite	the one I know little about that I think creates preseed.cfg is a package called kickstart,  I may have preseed.cfg confused with something else so
2012-03-29T21:13:00.000Z	latenite	sacarlson	preseed is debians way to do a auto-install. Its a textfile which I need to have a documentation on.
2012-03-29T21:14:00.000Z	sacarlson	latenite	do you have any examples of a preseed.cfg file so I can compare the two
2012-03-29T21:15:00.000Z	latenite	sacarlson	sure https://help.ubuntu.com/10.04/installation-guide/i386/preseed-using.html ist the 1st link there http://help.ubuntu.com/10.04/installation-guide/example-preseed.txt
2012-03-29T21:22:00.000Z	sacarlson	latenite	ya it's completely different and yet totaly the same,  another completely different way of doing the same thing
2012-03-29T21:23:00.000Z	sacarlson	latenite	too bad they don't have a gui like kickstart for it yet.  or do they?
2012-03-29T21:26:00.000Z	latenite	sacarlson	not that I have heard of. All i nee dto knwo is where to find all the funny parametes like "d-i netcfg/choose_interface". because there are more to be used that there are in the example file. I just cant find a real documentation. like a project page or such alike
2012-03-29T21:29:00.000Z	sacarlson	latenite	this looks like a good method to create a preseed.cfg file by just captureing a real install to clone it as shown here http://pthree.org/2008/05/20/automating-debianubuntu-installs-with-preseed/
2012-03-29T21:32:00.000Z	latenite	sacarlson	nice thing. That might realy help me out. Let me set up a box and try that. cool thanks for that link :D
2012-03-29T21:38:00.000Z	sacarlson	latenite	I just learned from that same article that preseed.cfg file is also compatible with the kickstart file format but seems not 100% all the features are present.  so in theory you could use the kickstart gui to do most or parts of the preseed.cfg generation
2012-03-29T21:39:00.000Z	latenite	sacarlson	oh realy? I am on gentoo let me check if they have a kickstart-gui thing.
2012-03-29T21:40:00.000Z	sacarlson	latenite	kickstart is in ubuntu
2012-03-29T21:40:00.000Z	sacarlson	latenite	but I guess gento would also gen a compatible preseed.cfg ?
2012-03-29T21:41:00.000Z	latenite	sacarlson	probably not. gentoo is a litle different. But i guess I will just install ubuntu once and seee from there
2012-03-29T21:41:00.000Z	sacarlson	latenite	ya or run it in virtualbox to find out
2012-03-29T21:42:00.000Z	latenite	sacarlson	actually I kind of do..with esxi
2012-03-29T21:42:00.000Z	sacarlson	latenite	I think kickstart is a gtk gui so whatever that takes I guess
