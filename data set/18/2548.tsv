2011-10-14T06:24:00.000Z	abhijain		what is the best way to switch from 10.10 to 11.10
2011-10-14T06:25:00.000Z	Moc	abhijain	you could stick to 10.10 if your happy..
2011-10-14T06:25:00.000Z	Moc	abhijain	I regret my upgrade I jsut did
2011-10-14T06:25:00.000Z	abhijain	Moc	why so
2011-10-14T06:26:00.000Z	Moc	abhijain	the unity experience is the big problem... and gnome 3 is basicly the same
2011-10-14T06:26:00.000Z	Moc		I'm on the gnome-session-fallback rightnow...
2011-10-14T06:26:00.000Z	Moc		feel a bit like 10.10, BUT not as refined..
2011-10-14T06:26:00.000Z	abhijain	Moc	so whats bad to adopt new things
2011-10-14T06:26:00.000Z	Moc	abhijain	new thing isn't a problem, the problem is when it actually get in the way of productivity
2011-10-14T06:27:00.000Z	abhijain	Moc	I have installed vmware and used fedora15 simultaneously with gnome3 and its awesum
2011-10-14T06:27:00.000Z	Moc		I just switched away from gnome 3... The alt-tab is one of the big reason
2011-10-14T06:28:00.000Z	abhijain	Moc	oh, first day and controversey starts.
2011-10-14T06:28:00.000Z	Moc		but all the current application integration into the top bar arn't working... But this might just be an ubuntu issue...
2011-10-14T06:28:00.000Z	Moc	abhijain	I tried to switch to 11.04, and I had the same problem
2011-10-14T06:28:00.000Z	Moc		I reverted back to 10.10
2011-10-14T06:29:00.000Z	Moc		I would have reverted back again if it wernt for gnome-session-fallback
2011-10-14T06:29:00.000Z	Moc		it not perfect, but it usable
2011-10-14T06:29:00.000Z	abhijain	Moc	wait till december alpha1 is releasing
