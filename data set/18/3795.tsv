2009-07-30T10:19:00.000Z	stryker		he has an Acer Aspire 5920
2009-07-30T10:20:00.000Z	stryker		so im cracking my head as to how i can try and fix this problem
2009-07-30T10:21:00.000Z	stryker		it has to be the graphics card, because the screen doesn't turn on at all
2009-07-30T10:21:00.000Z	stryker		is it possible for the card to just shut-off?
2009-07-30T10:22:00.000Z	WeblionX	stryker	The backlight might have died.  If you hold it up to light can you see any sort of picture?
2009-07-30T10:22:00.000Z	stryker	WeblionX	no
2009-07-30T10:41:00.000Z	WeblionX	stryker	Try resetting the BIOS?
2009-07-30T10:42:00.000Z	WeblionX	stryker	Remove the battery, unplug it, and find the reset button.  Could be on the back, or possible under the keyboard.
2009-07-30T10:42:00.000Z	stryker	WeblionX	wait, what about the CMOS?
2009-07-30T10:43:00.000Z	WeblionX	stryker	What do you mean what about it?
2009-07-30T10:43:00.000Z	stryker	WeblionX	how can I reset cmos? via the mobo?
2009-07-30T10:43:00.000Z	WeblionX	stryker	Remove the battery, unplug it, and find the reset button.  Could be on the back, or possible under the keyboard.
2009-07-30T10:44:00.000Z	WeblionX	stryker	You probably have to hold it for 5-10 seconds.
2009-07-30T10:44:00.000Z	stryker	WeblionX	hmm
