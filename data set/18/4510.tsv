2010-06-02T07:23:00.000Z	swathanthran		say for a directory >2gb du -hsc . in ubuntu takes about a minute
2010-06-02T07:23:00.000Z	cfedde	swathanthran	same hosts? same cache state?
2010-06-02T07:29:00.000Z	swathanthran	cfedde	jamesd2 its the same directory.. i donno about "cache state" what to check about that?
2010-06-02T07:30:00.000Z	swathanthran	cfedde	jamesd2: and same system.
2010-06-02T07:30:00.000Z	cfedde	swathanthran	I'm a bit confused about how two different oses can have access to the same directory at the same time. via nfs?
2010-06-02T07:31:00.000Z	swathanthran	cfedde	sorry not the same time but at different time.. but it was very common, every du took a long time in ubuntu and almost instantenous on arch
2010-06-02T07:33:00.000Z	cfedde	swathanthran	I suppose I'd have to chalk it up to unknown details. If you're realy serious about investigating this then setting up a repeatable measureable test would be critical.
2010-06-02T07:34:00.000Z	swathanthran	cfedde	okay, i'll try it on newer ubuntu .. i just wanted to see if its just about missing some config some where on ubuntu so that i can make it faster on ubuntu too..
2010-06-02T07:35:00.000Z	swathanthran	cfedde	what configs can there be around du regarding cache? btw where can i read more about du and disk cache?(searching a bit didn't turn up what i wanted)
2010-06-02T07:36:00.000Z	cfedde	swathanthran	the source for du is available.  I suspect that most linuxes use the same code.
2010-06-02T07:38:00.000Z	swathanthran	cfedde	oh btw, is this a general problem?(does du -hsc . on a directory >20gb on an average laptop take more than 10 seconds on ubuntu?)
2010-06-02T07:40:00.000Z	cfedde	swathanthran	I've not seen that problem.  I'd expect the time for du to complete would depend on the complexity of the filesystem traversed and the state of filebuffers in ram.
2010-06-02T07:40:00.000Z	cfedde	swathanthran	perhaps also on which filesystem is in use.   but you claim that they are the same in your case.
2010-06-02T07:41:00.000Z	swathanthran	cfedde	yeah both are ext3 and same directory
2010-06-02T07:41:00.000Z	swathanthran	cfedde	well say it doesn't vary with directory
2010-06-02T07:41:00.000Z	swathanthran	cfedde	i mean the difference is seen every time..
2010-06-02T07:42:00.000Z	swathanthran	cfedde	anyway i'll try myself a newer version..
2010-06-02T07:44:00.000Z	swathanthran	cfedde	gotta go, thanks for the help:)
