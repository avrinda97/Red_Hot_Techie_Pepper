2006-07-26T06:58:00.000Z	zicada_		Hi, ive got an issue with international characters. I just installed, and i get my chars in gnome-terminal, but if i ssh to another box, i cant type them. Any ideas ?
2006-07-26T06:59:00.000Z	crimsun	zicada_	the remote host probably doesn't have the correct $TERM and/or locales generated
2006-07-26T06:59:00.000Z	zicada_	crimsun	it doesnt have UTF8, is that needed on the remote host for this to work ?
2006-07-26T07:01:00.000Z	crimsun	zicada_	at least ISO8859-1{,5}
2006-07-26T07:02:00.000Z	zicada_	crimsun	it does have that, works from every other box ive tried, and even from windows using putty
2006-07-26T07:02:00.000Z	zicada_	crimsun	so it feels like the problem is local
2006-07-26T07:02:00.000Z	crimsun	zicada_	what's $TERM in putty and using g-t?
2006-07-26T07:03:00.000Z	zicada_	crimsun	TERM=xterm
2006-07-26T07:03:00.000Z	zicada_	crimsun	from here
2006-07-26T07:03:00.000Z	crimsun	zicada_	and $LANG ?
2006-07-26T07:04:00.000Z	zicada_	crimsun	not set
2006-07-26T07:04:00.000Z	zicada_	crimsun	export LANG=no ?
2006-07-26T07:06:00.000Z	zicada_	crimsun	what happens is when i type the norwegian chars, i can backspace past the prompt..
2006-07-26T07:06:00.000Z	zicada_	crimsun	and in irssi etc they look really weird :)
2006-07-26T07:06:00.000Z	crimsun	zicada_	is irssi configured to use UTF-8?
2006-07-26T07:08:00.000Z	zicada_	crimsun	not remotely, but i figured it out, added 8859-10 to gnome-term,  that worked
2006-07-26T07:08:00.000Z	zicada_	crimsun	thanks anyway :)
2006-07-26T07:08:00.000Z	crimsun	zicada_	excellent
