2011-10-25T05:29:00.000Z	JetJagurXP		I guess my question is:  What is the correct way to auto launch an app when I login to Lubuntu?
2011-10-25T05:30:00.000Z	dr_willis	JetJagurXP	 lubuntu/lxde uses openbox. and i think it can use the ~/.config/autostart/  directory
2011-10-25T05:31:00.000Z	JetJagurXP	dr_willis	 I did that.  However, the application I started doesn't close when I log out.  I guess that is the expected behavior.  But I want it so shut down when I log out also...
2011-10-25T05:31:00.000Z	dr_willis	JetJagurXP	 cant say ive ever noticed the issue.. guess ig can depend on the app.
2011-10-25T05:36:00.000Z	JetJagurXP	dr_willis	 Should I add a line to my bash_logout file to close it if it's open?
2011-10-25T05:37:00.000Z	dr_willis	JetJagurXP	 you could try.
2011-10-25T05:37:00.000Z	dr_willis	JetJagurXP	 ive never seen an app manage to stay around after i log out of X. :)  unless i spawn it to the background..
2011-10-25T05:39:00.000Z	JetJagurXP	dr_willis	 I am launching it with the command conky -c /home/<username>/.conky/conkyrc
2011-10-25T05:39:00.000Z	dr_willis	JetJagurXP	 ive never had conky prevent me from logging out.. what is it doing exactly?
2011-10-25T05:39:00.000Z	dr_willis	JetJagurXP	 'conky  -yadda yadda &'   perhaps..
2011-10-25T05:40:00.000Z	JetJagurXP	dr_willis	 Oh I can log out.  But conky continues to run.  Shows up on the Login screen.
2011-10-25T05:40:00.000Z	dr_willis	JetJagurXP	 now thats an interesting bug.... never seen that befor.
2011-10-25T05:40:00.000Z	JetJagurXP	dr_willis	 If I login again conky launches a second time.
2011-10-25T05:40:00.000Z	dr_willis	JetJagurXP	 check the askubuntu.com site and the forums perhaps...  you could do a 'killall conky'  in your logout file i guess.
2011-10-25T05:41:00.000Z	JetJagurXP	dr_willis	 Is is because I'm launching it using a .desktop file in HOME/.config/autostart  ?
2011-10-25T05:41:00.000Z	dr_willis	JetJagurXP	 shouldent matter.
2011-10-25T05:42:00.000Z	dr_willis	JetJagurXP	 conky is very popular. id bet if this is a common issue. theres mention of it on the forums, askubuntu.com and the conky forums.
2011-10-25T05:44:00.000Z	JetJagurXP	dr_willis	 Thanks.  At least I know I didn't so something goofy.
