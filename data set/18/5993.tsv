2008-08-31T08:10:00.000Z	kaiwen		Hi, I have a problem. So ubuntu 8.04 has been working lovely ever since I updated from gutsy. When I login with kdm or gdm (user name and password), kde3, kde4, gnome (depending on what I choose) is supposedly suppose to start. Now, when I login, kde, gnome, or whatever doesn't load (no splash screen too), but, the hard drive continuously continues to spin.
2008-08-31T08:10:00.000Z	kaiwen		anyone have an idea?
2008-08-31T08:10:00.000Z	kaiwen		goshh this sucks
2008-08-31T08:10:00.000Z	kaiwen		it's like forzen, the hard drive is still spinning
2008-08-31T08:10:00.000Z	kaiwen		the mouse moves, but really really slow b/c of the cpu usage
2008-08-31T08:10:00.000Z	kaiwen		!vista
2008-08-31T08:11:00.000Z	kaiwen		gdm and kdm works fine.
2008-08-31T08:11:00.000Z	basti	kaiwen	did you check xorg log?
2008-08-31T08:12:00.000Z	kaiwen		xserver is fine
2008-08-31T08:12:00.000Z	kaiwen		gui is fine
2008-08-31T08:12:00.000Z	kaiwen		the login screen is fine
2008-08-31T08:12:00.000Z	basti		sudo Jangari?
2008-08-31T08:13:00.000Z	kaiwen		it's a laptop, and I did a fsck under single user mode, same problem.
2008-08-31T08:14:00.000Z	basti	kaiwen	did you try to create another user anf then logged in with that one? just to check your conifgs are not messed up
2008-08-31T08:15:00.000Z	kaiwen	basti	yes
2008-08-31T08:15:00.000Z	kaiwen	basti	it's not configs...
2008-08-31T08:16:00.000Z	kaiwen	basti	it's not the xserver's problem, as xserver loads fine with kdm and gdm. It's once you login-with the gui- that the harddrive runs up and basically doesn't continue to load gnome or kde
