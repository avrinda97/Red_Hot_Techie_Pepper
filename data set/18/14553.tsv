2005-07-24T11:08:00.000Z	ColonelKernel		Im trying to make and install the latest stable kenrel from kernel.org, however after I install it a lot of things work very strangley
2005-07-24T11:08:00.000Z	ColonelKernel		im gonna try make oldconfig
2005-07-24T11:09:00.000Z	nickrud	ColonelKernel	the ubuntu kernel has some patches that the vanilla kernel does not
2005-07-24T11:09:00.000Z	ColonelKernel	nickrud	yeah ive noticed that - I dont know how happy I am about that, I think that may be my only complaint about ubuntu
2005-07-24T11:10:00.000Z	nickrud	ColonelKernel	the patches are the reason I use ubuntu/debian, personally
2005-07-24T11:10:00.000Z	nickrud	ColonelKernel	try starting from linux-source-2.6.10
2005-07-24T11:11:00.000Z	ColonelKernel	nickrud	im hoping thats the patched ubuntu kernel code
2005-07-24T11:11:00.000Z	nickrud	ColonelKernel	yes, it is
2005-07-24T11:11:00.000Z	ColonelKernel	nickrud	I can live with that then
2005-07-24T11:12:00.000Z	nickrud	ColonelKernel	apt-cache search linux-source in a terminal will get you going
2005-07-24T11:12:00.000Z	ColonelKernel	nickrud	got that already, just hadnt make my custom kernel for this yet
2005-07-24T11:29:00.000Z	nickrud	ColonelKernel	no not ever
2005-07-24T11:29:00.000Z	ColonelKernel	nickrud	why the hell not
2005-07-24T11:30:00.000Z	nickrud	ColonelKernel	the whole device stack: udev, hal, etc depends on hotplug, which is the current module loader.
2005-07-24T11:30:00.000Z	ColonelKernel	nickrud	how do I keep so many modules from loading then?
2005-07-24T11:31:00.000Z	nickrud	ColonelKernel	look over the modules you have loaded, then use /etc/hotplug/blacklist to drop the ones you don't want. Hotplug is pretty smart on my machine
2005-07-24T11:32:00.000Z	ColonelKernel	nickrud	thank you
2005-08-12T06:26:00.000Z	nickrud	ColonelKernel	if an implementation is choking you, look for another.
