2005-06-03T07:53:00.000Z	bigfoot		how do i mount? Can I mount in Nautilus?
2005-06-03T07:54:00.000Z	Shuddertrix	bigfoot	no, use the fstab for gmailfs
2005-06-03T07:54:00.000Z	bigfoot	Shuddertrix	hi. what's fstab? and how do i use it?
2005-06-03T07:56:00.000Z	Shuddertrix	bigfoot	If you used the debian package, you already installed it.
2005-06-03T07:59:00.000Z	bigfoot	Shuddertrix	okay, i've opened up terminal, ran  "sudo gedit /etc/fstab" and got gedit open up with a file called fstab.
2005-06-03T08:03:00.000Z	bigfoot	Shuddertrix	pardon my ignorance but what's the significance of fsname?
2005-06-03T08:05:00.000Z	bigfoot	Shuddertrix	i tried to mount it as you said, but i got this response in terminal: " old style mounting not supported"
2005-06-03T08:05:00.000Z	bigfoot	Shuddertrix	so you have a gmail account, too? isn't it great?
2005-06-03T08:09:00.000Z	bigfoot	Shuddertrix	have you been able to configure gmailfs on your computer ?
2005-06-03T08:13:00.000Z	bigfoot	Shuddertrix	alright. so i guess that means getting the files from the creator's website, correct?
2005-06-03T08:15:00.000Z	bigfoot	Shuddertrix	please confirm the next step. Thank you.
2005-06-03T08:18:00.000Z	Shuddertrix	bigfoot	working on it
2005-06-04T07:55:00.000Z	bigfoot	Shuddertrix	Hi
2005-06-04T08:24:00.000Z	Shuddertrix	bigfoot	you must have copied word for word what I typed into a file. bravo.
2005-06-04T08:26:00.000Z	bigfoot	Shuddertrix	I'm afraid you are mistaken. I made that mistake on a previous time, but not now. 8-)      I put in my own gmail username and gmail password.
2005-06-04T08:27:00.000Z	Shuddertrix	bigfoot	re-read what I typed. Infact, say it out loud, too..
2005-06-04T08:28:00.000Z	bigfoot	Shuddertrix	I'd be happy to re-read, but which of your messages shall i re-read?
2005-06-04T08:29:00.000Z	Shuddertrix	bigfoot	< Shuddertrix> bigfoot: you must have copied word for word of what I typed into a file. bravo.
