2005-01-31T14:07:00.000Z	tanek		how do I change the default output card for alsa? i finally (somehow, don't really know how) got my sound working after trying a week (!!!), but now, to be able to use it i have to manually change sound card in the options (XMMS is the only thing I've got working yet)
2005-01-31T14:07:00.000Z	tanek		had system + gaim sound before last reboot
2005-01-31T14:08:00.000Z	tanek		think it all started working when i installed xmms-mad that uninstalled gstreamer-packages
2005-01-31T14:09:00.000Z	crimsun	tanek	how many sound cards are you using?
2005-01-31T14:09:00.000Z	tanek	crimsun	I have 2 cards, 1 soundblaster and 1 sis onboard sound that i do not use
2005-01-31T14:11:00.000Z	crimsun	tanek	is the onboard sis grabbing id 0?
2005-01-31T14:12:00.000Z	crimsun	tanek	paste the contents of /proc/asound/cards in #flood, please
2005-01-31T14:14:00.000Z	tanek	crimsun	done
2005-01-31T14:15:00.000Z	crimsun	tanek	which do you want to use?
2005-01-31T14:15:00.000Z	crimsun	tanek	are you using hoary?
2005-01-31T14:16:00.000Z	crimsun	tanek	hoary has a workaround for it, but warty will require a slightly more kludgy method: echo snd-ens1371 | sudo tee -a /etc/modules
2005-01-31T14:17:00.000Z	crimsun	tanek	when you reboot, your ensoniq card will be the first one (id 0).
2005-01-31T14:19:00.000Z	tanek	crimsun	it says snd_ens1371... all done?
2005-01-31T14:19:00.000Z	crimsun	tanek	what says snd_ens1371?
2005-01-31T14:19:00.000Z	crimsun	tanek	yes.
2005-01-31T14:26:00.000Z	tanek	crimsun	THANKS!!! now it works, and even ESD works, so I can have multiple apps running sound at the same time!
2005-01-31T14:27:00.000Z	crimsun	tanek	np
2005-01-31T14:27:00.000Z	crimsun	tanek	it's a huge team effort.
