2012-08-22T00:02:00.000Z	floogy		Hi, I tried to ask in #OOo, but nobody answered. So I'll paste it in here again. I got issues with base in lucid.
2012-08-22T00:02:00.000Z	floogy		OOo base didn't exist?
2012-08-22T00:02:00.000Z	floogy		<- in lucid?
2012-08-22T00:03:00.000Z	floogy		Hi, I'm using OOo in ubuntu lucid 10.04. It's version 3.2. It seems that I cannot create a new database.
2012-08-22T00:03:00.000Z	floogy		OOO320m19 (Build:9505)
2012-08-22T00:03:00.000Z	floogy		oo tab gives oowriter, oocalc .. but no oobase.
2012-08-22T00:03:00.000Z	floogy		file>new> lacks database, so I guess it's not possible to load adresses from a ods list to print lables in oowriter?
2012-08-22T00:03:00.000Z	floogy		I can load the ods from tools>options... and in the register OpenOffice.org Base I can add the ods as a new database, but it won't save that, and it doesn't appear as a database on a new label sheet
2012-08-22T00:05:00.000Z	AlanBell	floogy	yes, you need base installed as a dependency of the mailmerge stuff (you don't need to run base, just have it installed)
2012-08-22T00:08:00.000Z	floogy	AlanBell	thank you.
2012-08-22T00:09:00.000Z	floogy	AlanBell	openoffice.org-base-core <- I guess, that's the right package (apt-cache search lists that)
2012-08-22T00:11:00.000Z	floogy	AlanBell	Nope, I'll try it with openoffice.org-base
2012-08-22T00:13:00.000Z	AlanBell	floogy	you can also do tab complete when installing stuff so sudo apt-get install openoffice.org-ba<tab><tab> will list the possible completions

2012-08-22T00:19:00.000Z	AlanBell	floogy	that looks annoying, did you do an apt-get update first? I don't have Lucid so I am on LibreOffice so I can't really test that
2012-08-22T00:25:00.000Z	AlanBell	floogy	I would be a bit cautious of that
2012-08-22T00:26:00.000Z	floogy	AlanBell	what do you think on?
2012-08-22T00:26:00.000Z	AlanBell	floogy	well it might well work and be awesome, you might also consider upgrading to a new overall release of Ubuntu
