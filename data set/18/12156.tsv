2006-05-19T16:45:00.000Z	BlankMind		worked using esound
2006-05-19T05:10:00.000Z	BlankMind		I want to modify grub's menu.lst but it's on "read-only" mode and i don't know how to take it off! :p
2006-05-19T05:10:00.000Z	anstei	BlankMind	edit it as root with "sudo"
2006-05-19T05:11:00.000Z	BlankMind		how i make that anstei?
2006-05-19T05:11:00.000Z	anstei	BlankMind	how do you edit the file?
2006-05-19T05:11:00.000Z	BlankMind		i go in computer and find it (i would tell u the names but my ubuntu is in portuguese)
2006-05-19T05:12:00.000Z	anstei	BlankMind	what editor do you use? gedit?
2006-05-19T05:12:00.000Z	BlankMind	anstei	yes gedit
2006-05-19T05:13:00.000Z	anstei	BlankMind	then go applications -> run program ( i think it's in system or something like that) and type "gksu gedit", enter your password and open the file from there
2006-05-19T05:15:00.000Z	BlankMind	anstei	it says i'm using the wrong password, but i'm using the admin password I have configurated! :p
2006-05-19T05:15:00.000Z	anstei	BlankMind	try using the password for the user you are using currently
2006-05-19T05:16:00.000Z	BlankMind	anstei	It has only a user (me), and it's asking root password, i'm typing the only password I have configurated and it does not work... know why?
2006-05-19T05:17:00.000Z	anstei	BlankMind	uh, now. you can try to type "sudo gedit" in a terminal, that should work, too.
2006-05-19T05:18:00.000Z	BlankMind	anstei	yes it worked, thanks. Just a question, what is that "sudo"? what does it make?
2006-05-19T05:18:00.000Z	anstei	BlankMind	it "does" something as a "su", which stands for superuser = root
2006-05-19T05:18:00.000Z	anstei	BlankMind	so it executes the given command with root privileges
2006-05-19T05:19:00.000Z	BlankMind	anstei	hum... is that a mode to let it in eternal sudo mode? :p
