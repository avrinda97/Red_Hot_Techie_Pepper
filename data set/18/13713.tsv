2005-10-19T16:26:00.000Z	rob^lt	BlueMat	yes, just install firestarter and enable it
2005-10-19T16:26:00.000Z	BlueMat	rob^lt	yes Ive done that..but heres my problem
2005-10-19T16:27:00.000Z	rob^lt	BlueMat	you need to set all the clients to use the ip address of the internet connected machine as their gateway
2005-10-19T16:28:00.000Z	BlueMat	rob^lt	I have two boxes, BoxA asks if u like a proxy, it ha s awireless card/and eth card, box B has just ethernet, box B also dual boots Ubuntu & WinXp, Ive got it working fine sharing the connection through firestarter, but thing is, I can get windows to access the ics share from ubuntu, ive replicated IP addrs, subnets and gateways..any ideas?
2005-10-19T16:30:00.000Z	rob^lt	BlueMat	I'm a little confused to what you mean
2005-10-19T16:31:00.000Z	BlueMat	rob^lt	I have an ubuntu box sharing the inet connection to BoxB running Ubuntu on both, all works fine, BoxB dual boots ubuntu and xp, when I try to access the net via windows after duplicating eth0 details I cant talk to the net..
2005-10-19T16:32:00.000Z	rob^lt	BlueMat	you need to set the gateway in windows to the ip address of the sharing machine most likey
2005-10-19T16:32:00.000Z	BlueMat	rob^lt	Yeah I did that, I replicated the data from the ubuntu boot to the windows boot..
2005-10-19T16:33:00.000Z	rob^lt	BlueMat	could be the windows firewall
2005-10-19T16:33:00.000Z	BlueMat	rob^lt	turned off
2005-10-19T16:33:00.000Z	rob^lt	BlueMat	can you ping google.com from the xp box?
2005-10-19T16:34:00.000Z	BlueMat	rob^lt	nope host unreachable
2005-10-19T16:35:00.000Z	rob^lt	BlueMat	sounds like a config problem on your xp box
2005-10-19T16:35:00.000Z	rob^lt	BlueMat	can you ping the gateway?
2005-10-19T16:35:00.000Z	BlueMat	rob^lt	maybe i should just nuke it ;-)
2005-10-19T16:35:00.000Z	BlueMat	rob^lt	nope cant ping gateway
2005-10-19T16:36:00.000Z	rob^lt	BlueMat	can you ping the ip of the nic in the xp box from the xp box?
