2006-01-04T10:24:00.000Z	dabaR	kruemmel	post your /etc/network/interfaces to pastebin.
2006-01-04T10:25:00.000Z	dabaR	kruemmel	ok, you do so, and tell me when you had posted.
2006-01-04T10:28:00.000Z	dabaR	kruemmel	let me type, I will tell you what to do.
2006-01-04T10:28:00.000Z	dabaR	kruemmel	I see this quite often. I found a solution to it right away(it was introduced in breezy) so I never wondered as to what it really means, and why it happens. But, I know the most likely solution, it will likely fix your issue. Remove all lik

2006-01-04T10:31:00.000Z	dabaR	kruemmel	give me time, please...
2006-01-04T10:34:00.000Z	dabaR	kruemmel	not at all. just rerun the pppoeconf, ya, but only if your file is same as what is on that pastebin I made.
2006-01-04T10:38:00.000Z	dabaR	kruemmel	after a sudo pppoeconf?
2006-01-04T10:38:00.000Z	dabaR	kruemmel	almost impossible.

2006-01-04T10:45:00.000Z	kruemmel	dabaR	i will restart now
2006-01-04T10:48:00.000Z	kruemmel	dabaR	THX man, it works
