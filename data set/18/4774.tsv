2009-05-23T01:01:00.000Z	the[V]oid		everytime I want to run the debugger (gdb) through eclipse or code blocks the whole graphical system hangs, I can still move the mouse, but the X server doesn't even respond to ctrl+alt+backspace and I can only access the computer via ssh... what could cause this?
2009-05-23T01:01:00.000Z	mzz	the[V]oid	what are you running gdb on?
2009-05-23T01:01:00.000Z	the[V]oid	mzz	what do you mean? I'm running it on ubuntu 8.04 inside either eclipse IDE or code::blocks
2009-05-23T01:02:00.000Z	mzz	the[V]oid	attaching gdb halts the process you attach to (until you hit "continue" in the debugger). This makes gdb-ing processes like Xorg or your compositing manager tricky.
2009-05-23T01:04:00.000Z	the[V]oid	mzz	I am trying to debug a self written application, I never meant to debug the X server
2009-05-23T01:05:00.000Z	mzz	the[V]oid	then I don't understand what's going on here, unless you're breaking into your application while it has the server grabbed or something.
2009-05-23T01:06:00.000Z	mzz	the[V]oid	are you debugging a commandline or X app?
2009-05-23T01:07:00.000Z	the[V]oid	mzz	I've compiled it and am trying to run it with the debugger, but only one second after I hit the "debug" button in toolbar of either code::blocks or eclipse the graphical system hangs, as described above
2009-05-23T01:07:00.000Z	the[V]oid	mzz	there's no problem running it with gdb from the command line
2009-05-23T01:07:00.000Z	mzz	the[V]oid	I don't know what those buttons do (I don't use either ide). Does just attaching gdb to a process from the commandline fail the same way? If not, any idea what's different there?
2009-05-23T01:08:00.000Z	mzz	the[V]oid	if you can ssh in you can maybe get the /proc/$(pidof gdb)/cmdline out
2009-05-23T01:08:00.000Z	the[V]oid	mzz	I'm not familar with this, what's the purpose of getting it's command line?
2009-05-23T01:09:00.000Z	mzz	the[V]oid	well, if gdb works ok when invoked from a terminal window then presumably the ide is either invoking gdb differently or telling it to do something else differently. If it's invoking it differently /proc/$(pidof gdb)/cmdline would tell.
2009-05-23T01:14:00.000Z	the[V]oid	mzz	I've gotten the cmd line from 'ps aux | grep gdb', it states 'gdb -nx -fullname -quiet -args <filename>' but when running it this way from the command line it works as well
2009-05-23T01:17:00.000Z	mzz	the[V]oid	ugh. It must be sending something to gdb that makes it do something stupid, but I can't think of a convenient way to think of what. If you kill gdb through ssh does the system recover?
2009-05-23T01:18:00.000Z	the[V]oid	mzz	yes it does
2009-05-23T01:19:00.000Z	mzz	the[V]oid	does your ide log what it sent and received from gdb anywhere?
2009-05-23T01:20:00.000Z	the[V]oid	mzz	I don't think so, if it does, than it's well hidden
