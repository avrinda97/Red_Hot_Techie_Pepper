2008-11-29T22:04:00.000Z	usamahashimi		can i ask hardware related questions here?
2008-11-29T22:05:00.000Z	usamahashimi		Does a Intel Dual core 2.0 GHz processor is more power than an Intel 3.0 GHz (HT) processor?
2008-11-29T22:07:00.000Z	comradekingu	usamahashimi	3.0Ghz what?
2008-11-29T22:08:00.000Z	comradekingu	usamahashimi	Intel core 2 processors use from 5.5-150W TDP
2008-11-29T22:09:00.000Z	usamahashimi	comradekingu	I mean does intel's simple 3.0 GHz processor (with HT) is more powerful or a intel's dual core 2.0 GHz processor?
2008-11-29T22:10:00.000Z	comradekingu	usamahashimi	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Intel_Core_2_microprocessors vs http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Intel_Pentium_4_microprocessors   ????
2008-11-29T22:10:00.000Z	usamahashimi	comradekingu	isn't dual core and core 2 are different processors?
2008-11-29T22:11:00.000Z	comradekingu	usamahashimi	No, the dual core are core 2 architecture, the old pentium4 are Netburst
2008-11-29T22:12:00.000Z	comradekingu	usamahashimi	Quad cores are also Core 2
2008-11-29T22:15:00.000Z	comradekingu	usamahashimi	Pentium 4 HT 530 and Pentium 4 HT 630 uses 84W so does Pentium 4 HT 631, but only 65W on lower vCore
2008-11-29T22:16:00.000Z	comradekingu	usamahashimi	Note that a 3Ghz p4 will be beaten silly clock for clock by a 3Ghz Core 2 processor
2008-11-29T22:16:00.000Z	comradekingu	usamahashimi	Or 2Ghz for that matter
2008-11-29T22:17:00.000Z	comradekingu	usamahashimi	Go for Core 2 quad or duo
2008-11-29T22:18:00.000Z	comradekingu	usamahashimi	Most P4 processors use 478 board, you wouldnt want to be stuck with that. Get socket 775
2008-11-29T22:18:00.000Z	usamahashimi	comradekingu	and which motherboard you recommend?
2008-11-29T22:19:00.000Z	usamahashimi	comradekingu	I want to play Tomb Raider Underworld
