2006-12-27T15:54:00.000Z	fnord_	LjL	2:) AI someone said robots have feeling too,
2006-12-27T15:55:00.000Z	fnord_	LjL	gosu is a game
2006-12-27T15:55:00.000Z	LjL	fnord_	ok, what about 1? what do you mean?
2006-12-27T15:58:00.000Z	fnord_	LjL	the aplications/system/etc menu from kubuntu,i like it and would like to use it under gnome,without het kubuntu desktop package
2006-12-27T15:59:00.000Z	LjL	fnord_	err... eh? it's *Ubuntu* (i.e. Gnome) that has an Applications/System/Places menu. Kubuntu has a single menu with a "K" icon.
2006-12-27T16:01:00.000Z	fnord_	LjL	theres the K then places and system or admin something like that
2006-12-27T16:02:00.000Z	LjL	fnord_	if you add them, yes... they're separate icons though. but in Gnome you simply *already* have those three separate menus by default, so i'm not sure what you're looking for
2006-12-27T16:02:00.000Z	LjL	fnord_	anyway, no, you can't use Kicker applets in the GNOME panel. nor viceversa
2006-12-27T16:03:00.000Z	fnord_	LjL	thanks
2006-12-27T16:04:00.000Z	fnord_	LjL	what aboute the mac like menu bar?
2006-12-27T16:04:00.000Z	LjL	fnord_	no luck. that doesn't even work with non-KDE apps *while* you're running them in KDE
