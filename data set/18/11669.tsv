2007-12-29T06:01:00.000Z	hwilde	mete	I know that when you run netstat and it says rpc.mountd  that is nfs http://linux.die.net/man/8/rpc.mountd

2007-12-29T06:03:00.000Z	mete	hwilde	I try to share one folder, which I can access from a windows client (without password). smb doesn't work for me
2007-12-29T06:06:00.000Z	mete	hwilde	I've used samba, but it's to slow for me (troughtput never over 50mb/s on a GBit net), so now I'll have a try to NFS
