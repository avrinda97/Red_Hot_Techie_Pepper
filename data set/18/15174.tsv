2005-09-23T08:46:00.000Z	abarbaccia		anybody use amarok with breezy and have it crash all the time?
2005-09-23T08:46:00.000Z	apokryphos	abarbaccia	when did you install?
2005-09-23T08:47:00.000Z	abarbaccia	apokryphos	it updated last night i believe
2005-09-23T08:48:00.000Z	apokryphos	abarbaccia	I mean, when did you install the latest version you have?
2005-09-23T08:48:00.000Z	apokryphos	abarbaccia	it's been updated since yesterday (which was when 1.3.1 was first put in)
2005-09-23T08:50:00.000Z	abarbaccia	apokryphos	i'm fully up to date
2005-09-23T08:50:00.000Z	apokryphos	abarbaccia	so sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install amarok   ...delivers "already latest version"?
2005-09-23T08:51:00.000Z	abarbaccia	apokryphos	yes
2005-09-23T08:51:00.000Z	apokryphos	abarbaccia	it's probably worth compiling a bug report, then.
2005-09-23T08:52:00.000Z	apokryphos	abarbaccia	what engine?
2005-09-23T08:52:00.000Z	abarbaccia	apokryphos	i use the xine engine
2005-09-23T08:52:00.000Z	apokryphos	abarbaccia	hm, same; no crashes though. Odd.
2005-09-23T08:52:00.000Z	abarbaccia	apokryphos	alright, well, maybe it was just a fluke thing
2005-09-23T08:52:00.000Z	apokryphos	abarbaccia	but you said it "kept" crashing, no?
2005-09-23T08:53:00.000Z	abarbaccia	apokryphos	its done it like 3x since the upgrade
2005-09-23T08:53:00.000Z	apokryphos	abarbaccia	since the upgrade to 1.3.1?
2005-09-23T08:53:00.000Z	apokryphos	abarbaccia	when it was first packaged there were known problems wiht it. It was repackaged a few times since then though
2005-09-23T08:53:00.000Z	apokryphos	abarbaccia	if you say you have the latest and there's still crashes, then there's apparently still probs.
