2009-05-22T06:07:00.000Z	Pici	PacoBuntu	Remove the repository from your sources.  Check System>Administration>Software Sources
2009-05-22T06:09:00.000Z	Pici	PacoBuntu	You must have. We do not magically add things to the sources.list
2009-05-22T06:10:00.000Z	Pici	PacoBuntu	Regardless of whether you did or didnt, there is something in your sources giving you that error.
2009-05-22T06:11:00.000Z	Pici	PacoBuntu	We've already told you.
2009-05-22T06:11:00.000Z	Pici	PacoBuntu	Please humour us and check.
2009-05-22T06:13:00.000Z	PacoBuntu	Pici	i am not sure which entry is supposed to be faulty: http://pastebin.ca/1430468
2009-05-22T06:15:00.000Z	Pici	PacoBuntu	Can you pastebin the result of:  ls /etc/apt/sources.list.d/
2009-05-22T06:19:00.000Z	PacoBuntu	Pici	ls /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ is not generating any results
2009-05-22T06:22:00.000Z	Pici	PacoBuntu	Can you check in System>Administration Software sources in the third party sources tab?
2009-05-22T06:25:00.000Z	PacoBuntu	Pici	i can see a cairo-dock source there, but it isnt in the /etc/apt/sources.list
2009-05-22T06:27:00.000Z	Pici	PacoBuntu	It looks like that key error is due to missing the docky GPG key for their ppa
2009-05-22T06:27:00.000Z	Pici	PacoBuntu	This is the correct page where their gpg key is listed: http://keyserver.ubuntu.com:11371/pks/lookup?search=0x28A8205077558DD0&op=index
2009-05-22T06:27:00.000Z	PacoBuntu	Pici	but i dont want to install cairo-dock so do i still need to do all that?
