2007-07-13T16:43:00.000Z	TaJMoX	Dusk_	run alacarte
2007-07-13T16:49:00.000Z	Dusk_	TaJMoX	there's an icon of the game by default but when i try to add to applications menu there's no icon
2007-07-13T16:50:00.000Z	TaJMoX	Dusk_	 in alacarte?
2007-07-13T16:50:00.000Z	Dusk_	TaJMoX	yep
2007-07-13T16:50:00.000Z	TaJMoX	Dusk_	do you have the little check box thingy checked?  =)
2007-07-13T16:50:00.000Z	TaJMoX	Dusk_	if you add an application in alacarte - it should show up on your gnome menu
2007-07-13T16:51:00.000Z	Dusk_	TaJMoX	yes it is...but no icon
2007-07-13T16:51:00.000Z	Dusk_	TaJMoX	no png i mean
2007-07-13T16:52:00.000Z	TaJMoX	Dusk_	OHH so there is the menu entry just no graphical icon
2007-07-13T16:52:00.000Z	Dusk_	TaJMoX	yes graphical icon..but in the desktop icon there was a grap. icon
2007-07-13T16:53:00.000Z	TaJMoX	Dusk_	maybe the png is not a valid format ?   try saving it as a jpg or something?   or re-save it in gimp?    does this happen with ANY icon you chose or just the one icon that you need?
2007-07-13T16:54:00.000Z	Dusk_	TaJMoX	there's no png file of this icon..or i couldn't find..is it possible? an icon with no png file? or is it in some directory that i couldn't find?
2007-07-13T16:55:00.000Z	TaJMoX	Dusk_	find the icon file that you want to set it to
