2007-01-24T12:07:00.000Z	ruphy		hello guys, I updated my dapper to edgy some time ago, and I need to install libxss-dev, but when I try it tells me (translating italian-->english):
2007-01-24T12:08:00.000Z	ruphy		libxss-dev: Depends on: libxss1 (= 1:1.0.1-4ubuntu1) but 1:1.1-0ubuntu1 is going to bi installed
2007-01-24T12:08:00.000Z	ruphy		so an ubuntu bug I think
2007-01-24T12:08:00.000Z	ruphy		could you guys help me?
2007-01-24T12:08:00.000Z	frogzoo	ruphy	we don't know yet
2007-01-24T12:09:00.000Z	frogzoo	ruphy	oh, seems we do
2007-01-24T12:09:00.000Z	ruphy	frogzoo	what's the problem?
2007-01-24T12:10:00.000Z	frogzoo	ruphy	well it looks like the problem is someones goofed on the packaging
2007-01-24T12:10:00.000Z	ruphy	frogzoo	I need to install the lastest developement files for libxss to compile kde4 (I'm a kde4 dev)
2007-01-24T12:11:00.000Z	frogzoo	ruphy	if you're running feisty, I'd suggest asking in #ubuntu+1
2007-01-24T12:11:00.000Z	ruphy	frogzoo	yeah, that's what I thought too, but I don't have much experience with debian-like distros... it seems that the edgy version is missing, anyway, what I can do to fix that?
2007-01-24T12:11:00.000Z	ruphy	frogzoo	no, edgy
2007-01-24T12:12:00.000Z	ruphy	frogzoo	that's strange infact... edgy should be stable
2007-01-24T12:12:00.000Z	frogzoo	ruphy	well I don't know why that package is broken, you could force the install, but it may be true what it says, it may need the older package
2007-01-24T12:13:00.000Z	ruphy	frogzoo	and... how I do that?
2007-01-24T12:15:00.000Z	ruphy	frogzoo	could you  tell me how do I install a specific version of a pagkage?
2007-01-24T12:15:00.000Z	frogzoo	ruphy	I really suggest you research the problem on google or launchpad - just using apt-get --fix-broken willy nilly will break your system
2007-01-24T12:18:00.000Z	ruphy	frogzoo	anyway, thanks dude
