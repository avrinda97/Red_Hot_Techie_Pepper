2008-10-20T17:43:00.000Z	kulfi		any advice whether i can use DNS to resolve just local IPs? currently other PCs on the network sporadically get confused when trying to browse to external websites
2008-10-20T17:45:00.000Z	kulfi		LjjL. yes, i'd like to set up a sandbox server, and browse to http://sandbox.local from other PCs
2008-10-20T17:45:00.000Z	the_lost_one	kulfi	maybe you need to tweak /etc/hosts ?
2008-10-20T17:45:00.000Z	kulfi	the_lost_one	and disable DNS?
2008-10-20T17:46:00.000Z	kulfi	the_lost_one	was that for me (kulfi)?
2008-10-20T17:47:00.000Z	the_lost_one	kulfi	np :)
2008-10-20T17:47:00.000Z	kulfi	the_lost_one	dns is checked in second state by other PCs on the network, or just the ubuntu instance>
2008-10-20T17:48:00.000Z	the_lost_one	kulfi	of course, just ubuntu box
2008-10-20T17:48:00.000Z	kulfi	the_lost_one	ok it's the other network PCs that are getting confused. sounds like i should disabled DNS on the ubuntu server
2008-10-20T17:49:00.000Z	the_lost_one	kulfi	but, whats exactly the issue?
2008-10-20T17:50:00.000Z	kulfi	the_lost_one	- i'd like to browse to http://sandbox.local, and also not have other network PCs confused (as the currently, sporadically are) when trying to browse to external websites
2008-10-20T17:51:00.000Z	the_lost_one	kulfi	then you have a dns server in ubuntu and this one is used to resolve names by the rest of boxes?
2008-10-20T17:55:00.000Z	the_lost_one	kulfi	ok, then you must configure in your dns server sandbox.local.com to the IP where its stored
2008-10-20T17:56:00.000Z	the_lost_one	kulfi	or write sandbox.local in every hosts file of your boxes
2008-10-20T17:57:00.000Z	kulfi	the_lost_one	i see, the clients' hosts files need to know where to find http://sandbox.local, w/o DNS the server can't do that
2008-10-20T17:57:00.000Z	the_lost_one	kulfi	rigth
2008-10-20T17:58:00.000Z	the_lost_one	kulfi	try it with one client
2008-10-20T17:59:00.000Z	the_lost_one	kulfi	no prob :)
