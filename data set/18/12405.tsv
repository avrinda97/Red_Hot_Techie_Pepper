2006-04-24T08:40:00.000Z	NullVector		Hello all
2006-04-24T08:41:00.000Z	NullVector		could someone help me out, New to Linux, and attempting to get Ut2004 running. I believe I was able to get it successfully installed.
2006-04-24T08:43:00.000Z	NullVector		can anyone read this?
2006-04-24T08:43:00.000Z	NullVector		ty
2006-04-24T08:44:00.000Z	NullVector		would I be right in assuming that SH files are equivalent to exe files?
2006-04-24T08:45:00.000Z	NullVector		TY Nafai
2006-04-24T08:46:00.000Z	NullVector		so what type of file would I use to luanch a game?
2006-04-24T08:47:00.000Z	NullVector		bin?
2006-04-24T08:49:00.000Z	WoC	NullVector	if you installed it, it should have installed a startup script for it, try ut<tab> for possible names of the startup script
2006-04-24T08:50:00.000Z	NullVector		ty
2006-04-24T08:50:00.000Z	WoC		np
2006-04-24T08:50:00.000Z	WoC		found it?
2006-04-24T08:53:00.000Z	WoC		Busy Playing, I reckon
2006-04-24T08:53:00.000Z	WoC		Aye ;] 
2006-04-24T08:54:00.000Z	NullVector	WoC	where would I do this UT<tab> slightly confused?
2006-04-24T08:54:00.000Z	WoC		oh
2006-04-24T08:57:00.000Z	WoC		I don't remember the name of the startup script, haven't had it installed since it came out... but I chances are it would be named something like ut* so if you are using bash, using ut<tab> will show all commands starting with ut
2006-04-24T08:57:00.000Z	NullVector	WoC	so from terminal type "bash Ut"
