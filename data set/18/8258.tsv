2007-09-24T07:31:00.000Z	jpastore		this isn't an ubuntu question, but I checked other channels....Is there a way to just disable return receipts in thunderbird? Outlook has this feature and I communicate with a few that automatically request a return receipt on every email and it's starting to drive me mad
2007-09-24T07:31:00.000Z	jpastore		well I am crazy but this I can help =)
2007-09-24T07:31:00.000Z	rexy_	jpastore	yeah
2007-09-24T07:33:00.000Z	jpastore	rexy_	yes I'm crazy or yes thunderbird will allow you to permanently deny return receipts...if the latter can y ou point me in the right direction?
2007-09-24T07:33:00.000Z	rexy_	jpastore	yes thunderbird allows permanently disabling return receipts
2007-09-24T07:33:00.000Z	rexy_		i cant find the option atm though
2007-09-24T07:34:00.000Z	jpastore	rexy_	any idea how? I've been poking through the options and I can't find anything obvious
2007-09-24T07:34:00.000Z	jpastore	rexy_	same problem I had
2007-09-24T07:36:00.000Z	rexy_	jpastore	edit -> account settings -> your account name -> return receipts
2007-09-24T07:37:00.000Z	jpastore		rexy, thanks let me look
2007-09-24T07:37:00.000Z	jpastore		rexy you rock....I thought that would have been a global rpeference
2007-09-24T07:39:00.000Z	rexy_		unrar
2007-09-24T07:41:00.000Z	rexy_		the ubuntu archive program understands the rar extensions, and knows what to do with them, however it needs the unrar program to actually unpack them
2007-09-24T07:46:00.000Z	rexy_	jpastore	did it work?
2007-09-24T07:46:00.000Z	rexy_		heu thought there was supposed to be a cd-drive you can click on?
2007-09-24T07:47:00.000Z	jpastore	rexy_	well I set it...I'll know the next time I get an email from those 2 particularly annoying individuals
2007-09-24T07:47:00.000Z	jpastore	rexy_	I guess I could send a message to myself and see
2007-09-24T07:52:00.000Z	jpastore	rexy_	it worked...I happened to get IM'd by a client and they were able to send me a test msg...thanks
