2012-05-23T15:08:00.000Z	sary	Fat-Thing	depends , how you got it installed in the first place .. as i recall there are two packages to install the adobe flash
2012-05-23T15:10:00.000Z	sary	Fat-Thing	check with apt-cache policy adobe-flashplugin .. if its this package then sudo apt-get remove --purge adobe-flashplugin .
2012-05-23T15:29:00.000Z	sary	Fat-Thing	Excuse me , my lap froze .. i guess X crached.
2012-05-23T15:31:00.000Z	sary	Fat-Thing	so apt-cahce showed that package is not installed , you need to remove purge the other one which i can't remember its name .
2012-05-23T15:32:00.000Z	sary	Fat-Thing	Yeah , i've seen the output ..
2012-05-23T15:32:00.000Z	sary	Fat-Thing	lemme check the correct name for it.
2012-05-23T15:35:00.000Z	sary	Fat-Thing	my last post was for you.
2012-05-23T15:38:00.000Z	sary	Fat-Thing	ah , the other package is flashplugin-installer .
