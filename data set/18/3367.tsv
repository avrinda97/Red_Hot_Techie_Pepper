2011-02-20T21:36:00.000Z	Bodsda		Hi - I am trying to set up hamachi - It has created a ham0 interface and given me an IP, which I can ping - but when I attempt to ping someone else on my hamachi vpn via their hamachi interface IP, I get 'ping: sendmsg: Operation not permitted' - anyone got any ideas what might be wrong?

2011-02-20T21:37:00.000Z	Bodsda	eject_ck	I have run    sudo ufw disable
2011-02-20T21:37:00.000Z	eject_ck	Bodsda	iptables -F
2011-02-20T21:37:00.000Z	eject_ck	Bodsda	check what do you have first
2011-02-20T21:38:00.000Z	eject_ck	Bodsda	iptables -L
2011-02-20T21:38:00.000Z	eject_ck		Can someone help with audio ?
2011-02-20T21:40:00.000Z	Bodsda	eject_ck	well, that stopped me from being able to ping anything and dropped my network :) reconnected and now I can ping things and myself, but still not another machine on the hamachi vpn
2011-02-20T21:41:00.000Z	eject_ck		you are trying to ping on gateway or from internal network ?
2011-02-20T21:41:00.000Z	Bodsda	eject_ck	internal network
2011-02-20T21:41:00.000Z	eject_ck		check on your peer ham interface with tcpdump
2011-02-20T21:42:00.000Z	eject_ck		did you set routing ?
2011-02-20T21:42:00.000Z	eject_ck		this is my system config http://pastebin.com/LqwA8v69
2011-02-20T21:42:00.000Z	eject_ck		can someone help me to figure why I have no dsp in my system
2011-02-20T21:43:00.000Z	eject_ck	Bodsda	can you describe your setup ?
2011-02-20T21:45:00.000Z	Bodsda	eject_ck	I cant ping myself again, operation not permitted - tcpdump of that interface gives nothing because I cant ping myself - setup is two PC's on the same network, one ethernet one wifi, both ubuntu, hamachi installed and connected to a vpn created through hamachi
2011-02-20T21:45:00.000Z	eject_ck	Bodsda	do you have admin permissions on that hosts ?
2011-02-20T21:46:00.000Z	Bodsda	eject_ck	logged in as root on both
