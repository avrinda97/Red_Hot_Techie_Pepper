2010-07-10T18:58:00.000Z	daniel2171		hi, i have linux 10.04 on my laptop and if i close the lid to put the laptop on hibernate then when i open the lid again the screen doesn't turn on. the laptop is on but the screen won't show anything i've searched for the bug on launchpad but theres nothing for my laptop (hp dv5 amd 64)
2010-07-10T18:59:00.000Z	geirha	daniel2171	Does it work correctly if you choose hibernate from the menu (and not close the lid)?
2010-07-10T19:00:00.000Z	daniel2171	geirha	Yea the problem is in closing it
2010-07-10T19:01:00.000Z	geirha	daniel2171	Had the same thing on my laptop. I eventually figured out it was the driver for the intel graphics card. (with the latest kernel though, X won't start at all, just completely freeze the system)
2010-07-10T19:02:00.000Z	daniel2171		i have an ati video card
2010-07-10T19:03:00.000Z	geirha	daniel2171	I'm using the vesa driver as a workaround.
2010-07-10T19:03:00.000Z	daniel2171	geirha	Could i do that?
2010-07-10T19:03:00.000Z	geirha	daniel2171	Doesn't hurt to try. Do you have a /etc/X11/xorg.conf file?
2010-07-10T19:04:00.000Z	daniel2171	geirha	i don't know how can i check?
2010-07-10T19:04:00.000Z	geirha	daniel2171	Open a terminal and type
2010-07-10T19:05:00.000Z	geirha	daniel2171	''ls /etc/X11/''
2010-07-10T19:06:00.000Z	daniel2171	geirha	ok i did that
2010-07-10T19:06:00.000Z	geirha	daniel2171	Do you see xorg.conf in the list?
2010-07-10T19:06:00.000Z	daniel2171	geirha	no
2010-07-10T19:07:00.000Z	geirha	daniel2171	But there is an xorg.conf.failsafe, right?
2010-07-10T19:08:00.000Z	daniel2171	geirha	no
2010-07-10T19:09:00.000Z	geirha	daniel2171	Hm. Odd. Mine does.
2010-07-10T19:10:00.000Z	daniel2171	geirha	theres nothing that says xorg
