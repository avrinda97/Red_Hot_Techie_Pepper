2009-04-24T05:13:00.000Z	Cougarten	fwaokda	: you can disable it from startup
2009-04-24T05:13:00.000Z	Cougarten	fwaokda	: system - settings - and now I don't know the exact name (it changed, startup or sessions or something)
2009-04-24T05:14:00.000Z	fwaokda	Cougarten	how do i close it after doing that? or do i just have to restart?
2009-04-24T05:14:00.000Z	Cougarten	fwaokda	: login out and in should do the trick
2009-04-24T05:16:00.000Z	fwaokda	Cougarten	I did that and it isn't there anymore but now my desktop panel is black and there is no start menu or anything

2009-04-24T05:25:00.000Z	fwaokda	Cougarten	right click on background doesn't provide a menu either :(
2009-04-24T05:25:00.000Z	Cougarten	fwaokda	no, sry but shouldnt be to hard...
