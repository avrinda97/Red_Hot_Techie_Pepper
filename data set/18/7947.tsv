2007-10-23T19:53:00.000Z	llua		ever since feisty i am getting constatn crashes on firefox.
2007-10-23T19:53:00.000Z	llua		ever since feisty i am getting constatn crashes on firefox. it does not happen on my other machine so i am thinking it is hardware related.
2007-10-23T19:54:00.000Z	mayfairy	llua	Have you added new memory recently?
2007-10-23T19:54:00.000Z	llua		mayfairy:yep
2007-10-23T19:54:00.000Z	llua	mayfairy	could that be it
2007-10-23T19:54:00.000Z	mayfairy	llua	I did too recently and started having FF crashes until I removed the mem
2007-10-23T19:55:00.000Z	mayfairy	llua	Tried memtest86+ and turned out it was faulty mem.
2007-10-23T19:55:00.000Z	mayfairy	llua	Send it back to store and got a new one
2007-10-23T19:55:00.000Z	llua		but i never get these crashes in FF in windows
2007-10-23T19:55:00.000Z	mayfairy	llua	start FF from terminal and see what message it gives when FF crashes
2007-10-23T19:56:00.000Z	mayfairy	llua	If it's segmentation fault then it's possible that mem is to blame.
2007-10-23T19:56:00.000Z	mayfairy	llua	Strange thing was that I had no problem running other apps and stuff. Only FF crashed with new mem
2007-10-23T19:57:00.000Z	llua	mayfairy	i have 3 sticks of 512. could it be the actual arrangement of the ram?
2007-10-23T19:57:00.000Z	mayfairy	llua	Don't know for sure but might be
2007-10-23T19:58:00.000Z	mayfairy	llua	If you go switching rams be careful. They break easily
2007-10-23T19:59:00.000Z	llua	mayfairy	thanks :-) been doing it since the 386 era :-(
2007-10-23T19:59:00.000Z	llua	mayfairy	cheers.
