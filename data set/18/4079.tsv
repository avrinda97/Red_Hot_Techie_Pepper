2011-06-02T18:57:00.000Z	qin	edbian	Propably not.
2011-06-14T06:37:00.000Z	edbian	qin	what setting is it in the profile?
2011-06-14T06:36:00.000Z	qin	edbian	add "&& sleep 10 " to your command, without the quotes.
2011-06-14T06:36:00.000Z	qin	edbian	Or use profile with setting to keep terminal open
2011-06-14T06:39:00.000Z	edbian	qin	Found it.  Nevermind
2011-06-14T06:39:00.000Z	qin	edbian	gnome-terminal > Edit > Profile Pref > (tab) Title & Command: When
2011-06-14T06:39:00.000Z	qin	edbian	Nice
2011-06-14T06:39:00.000Z	edbian	qin	I see exit no longer works
2011-06-14T06:40:00.000Z	edbian	qin	Now the terminal stays open but it does not have 'hello world' printed in it?
2011-06-14T06:41:00.000Z	qin	edbian	try add "&& sleep 10" and do not add "&" at the end.
2011-06-14T06:42:00.000Z	edbian	qin	That's not helping.  gnome-terminal -x echo 'hello world' && echo 'yeah'
2011-06-14T06:42:00.000Z	qin	edbian	-e ?
2011-06-22T03:45:00.000Z	edbian	qin	He did with me in /media/<numbers>
2011-07-03T08:42:00.000Z	edbian	qin	There is no USB stick there (which is like.. bad)
2011-07-03T20:38:00.000Z	edbian	qin	There is a readme there.  extract and run ;)

2011-07-03T20:38:00.000Z	edbian	qin	That's what he's working on.
