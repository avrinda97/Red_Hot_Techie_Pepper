2007-07-19T14:42:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jayde_drag0n	Have you tried following the instructions on the wiki?
2007-07-19T14:43:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jayde_drag0n	The instructions on the wiki tell you how to find what (hd,X) you need
2007-07-19T15:56:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jayde_drag0n	Do you have only one hard drive?
2007-07-19T15:58:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jayde_drag0n	"umount"
2007-07-19T16:01:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jayde_drag0n	No, you can not mount a drive ( hdg ) only a partition ( hdg1 ), and from the pastebin hdg1 is correct
2007-07-19T06:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U	jayde_drag0n	Warum wurden Sie dass denken ? ;)
2007-07-21T07:17:00.000Z	jayde_drag0n	Jordan_U	i went thru System>Administrative>shared folders and set it up using the ipaddresses of my internal network first... was that correct and now all i have to do is share some folders?
2007-07-21T07:19:00.000Z	jayde_drag0n	Jordan_U	yeay!!! thanks so much i thought i did it wrong... do the systems need to be rebooted now.. or just share a folder and go (newbie.. i know rebooting is for windows.. btu what do i know?)
