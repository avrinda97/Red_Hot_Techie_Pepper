2007-03-19T11:40:00.000Z	lnx^		does anyone know/use 'zenity'?
2007-03-19T11:40:00.000Z	ardchoille	lnx^	I use zenity a lot
2007-03-19T11:40:00.000Z	lnx^	ardchoille	do you happen to know if it's possible to show dialogues from cron?
2007-03-19T11:41:00.000Z	ardchoille	lnx^	Yes, it is.. hold on and I'll get you an example
2007-03-19T11:41:00.000Z	lnx^	ardchoille	thanks :) couldn't find one anywhere
2007-03-19T11:42:00.000Z	ardchoille	lnx^	The problem you are experiencing is that cron doesn't know which display to use when launching zenity, so you need to tell cron which one to use.
2007-03-19T11:42:00.000Z	ardchoille	lnx^	Here is an example of how to use zenity from a cronjob: env DISPLAY=:0. zenity --info --title="Test" --text="This is a test."
2007-03-19T11:46:00.000Z	lnx^	ardchoille	in tty0 i get: xlib: connection to ":0.0" refused by server, no protocol specified
2007-03-19T11:47:00.000Z	ardchoille	lnx^	You're not going to be able to use zenity in anything other than the desktop unless you enable kernel framebuffer and have the apps that support it.
2007-03-19T11:48:00.000Z	lnx^	ardchoille	what about in crontab? or isn't running it in tty0 similar to running it from crontab?
2007-03-19T11:48:00.000Z	lnx^	ardchoille	i indeed want the dialog to appear in my X/gnome
2007-03-19T11:49:00.000Z	ardchoille	lnx^	You can't run gui's in anyting but the desktop unless you enable kernel framebuffer and have the apps that support it. The reason gui's can run from cron in the dekstop is because the desktop supports gui's
2007-03-19T11:50:00.000Z	ardchoille	lnx^	Run that command I gave you from a cronjob and you will see it pops up on the desktop
2007-03-19T11:50:00.000Z	lnx^	ardchoille	ok. does it also work with anacron?
2007-03-19T11:50:00.000Z	ardchoille	lnx^	I don't know, never used anacron
2007-03-19T12:01:00.000Z	lnx^	ardchoille	it doesn't seem to pop up from root's cronjobs
2007-03-19T12:02:00.000Z	lnx^	ardchoille	only works for the same user as is logged in for gnome. any way through that?
2007-03-19T12:05:00.000Z	ardchoille	lnx^	I don't know, I never run anything as root user via cron.
