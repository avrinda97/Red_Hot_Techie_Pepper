2008-11-04T08:30:00.000Z	zerothis		I'd like to make our organization's computers act enough like other operating systems that volunteers are not scared away from operating them. Similar look, same shortcut keys, menu layout, similar names for it all ("Stuff" menu instead of Start Menu, Contortion Panel, Finger instead of Finder, etc). I know how to do all that, but, can I then setup several "new user profiles", one themed mac, one themed XP, one themed vista. Th
2008-11-04T08:31:00.000Z	kgod	zerothis	Is there a question there?
2008-11-04T08:32:00.000Z	kgod	zerothis	how often are you doing new user creation?
2008-11-04T08:34:00.000Z	kgod	zerothis	I'd set that up as an admin feature.  Ask the user what their desktop pref is, say, Windows or OS X.  xfce4 is likely a better choice for themeable desktop as it does both osx and vista decorations
2008-11-04T08:35:00.000Z	kgod	zerothis	Are we talking tens of users a day, several a week, several a month, or what?
2008-11-04T08:35:00.000Z	kgod	zerothis	a template of configs, copied to the user's home dir via a script at acct creation, is likely your best bet.
2008-11-04T08:36:00.000Z	kgod	zerothis	remote logins to an X server, assigned desktops/laptops, or what?
2008-11-04T08:44:00.000Z	zerothis	kgod	each volunteer will be operating our computers in person on site. I and other trained staff can't always be there to guide them when we have a new person, it'll have to be an intuitive setup. xubuntu is great for the different looks but I'm not so sure about the different behaviors. I can start hacking in KDE and GNOME elements but then that presents a stability issue which is equally unfriendly to the volunteers
2008-11-04T08:44:00.000Z	kgod	zerothis	Keep It Simple, Silly.  Stick to xubuntu.
2008-11-04T08:46:00.000Z	kgod	zerothis	I'd script up the configuration, maybe have a web-based tool to set it up, or have a first-time session which presented the user with a UI configuration choice, copied in the appropriate configs, booted 'em out of X, then restarted them.
2008-11-04T08:48:00.000Z	zerothis	kgod	but can xubuntu simulate the mac menu bar like gnome, the vista wigets like KDE, all the keyboard shortcuts, the different menu layouts? Once they are booted to desktop, they'll be using the same 10 or so applications usually, so that part will be simple.
2008-11-04T08:49:00.000Z	kgod	zerothis	It's configurable, yes. There are a few desktops that specifically emulate a Windows desktop.  Most of them are based on icewm or fvwm2 IIRC.
2008-11-04T08:49:00.000Z	kgod	zerothis	I find that explicitly emulating Windows _isn't_ all that great an idea as you have the near valley effect.  It's close, but not quite there.
2008-11-04T08:49:00.000Z	kgod	zerothis	But see what works for you.
2008-11-04T08:50:00.000Z	kgod	zerothis	I'd ordinarially have said "just run KDE and set a Windows-like theme", but trying out KDE4 for the first time here it really is ass.
2008-11-04T08:57:00.000Z	zerothis	kgod	thanks
2008-11-04T08:58:00.000Z	kgod	zerothis	NP
