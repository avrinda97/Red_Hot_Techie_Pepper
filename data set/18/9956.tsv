2007-01-28T17:56:00.000Z	torrrrrrrrrr		can I run ubuntu without a GUI?
2007-01-28T17:56:00.000Z	Flannel	torrrrrrrrrr	of course.  I'm doing it
2007-01-28T17:57:00.000Z	torrrrrrrrrr	Flannel	how do I get rid of the gui?
2007-01-28T17:57:00.000Z	torrrrrrrrrr	Flannel	I have installed the desktop version
2007-01-28T17:57:00.000Z	Flannel	torrrrrrrrrr	you could remove the GUI stuff
2007-01-28T17:58:00.000Z	Flannel	torrrrrrrrrr	command line
2007-01-28T07:14:00.000Z	Flannel	torrrrrrrrrr	er, why not just run a real ftp sever?
2007-01-28T07:15:00.000Z	Flannel	torrrrrrrrrr	or native, anyway
2007-01-28T07:15:00.000Z	torrrrrrrrrr	Flannel	Because all my users and passwords are in FileZilla Server
2007-01-28T07:15:00.000Z	torrrrrrrrrr	Flannel	and I don't know how to take it from the conf file
2007-01-28T08:35:00.000Z	Flannel	torrrrrrrrrr	https://help.ubuntu.com/6.10/ubuntu/serverguide/C/ftp-server.html recommends vsftpd, but it depends on what you want to use it for, really.
2007-01-28T08:35:00.000Z	torrrrrrrrrr	Flannel	I want to use it for a small business that transfer files with its clients
2007-01-28T08:36:00.000Z	torrrrrrrrrr	Flannel	in the graphics indestry
2007-01-28T08:36:00.000Z	Flannel	torrrrrrrrrr	this is anonymouse ftp? or what?
2007-01-28T08:36:00.000Z	torrrrrrrrrr	Flannel	manly not anonymous
2007-01-28T08:37:00.000Z	Flannel	torrrrrrrrrr	do you want them to be real users on the system? or just ftp users?
2007-01-28T08:37:00.000Z	torrrrrrrrrr	Flannel	just on the FTP
2007-01-28T08:38:00.000Z	Flannel	torrrrrrrrrr	alright, vsftpd is probably not what you want then. you probably want proftpd
