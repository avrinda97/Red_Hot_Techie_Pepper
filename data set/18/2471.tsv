2010-06-11T12:11:00.000Z	Smeh		ok.. anyone able to help me out with a really confusing issue? I finally just got the cisco VPN client to compile on 10.04, however for some reason, despite there being a symlink in /usr/local/bin that is pointing to the correct location /opt/cisco-vpnclient/bin/vpnclient
2010-06-11T12:11:00.000Z	Smeh		typing vpnclient runs nothing?
2010-06-11T12:11:00.000Z	Smeh		just reports "/usr/local/bin/vpnclient" so such file or directory
2010-06-11T12:12:00.000Z	Appl6	Smeh	What does "which vpnclient" show?
2010-06-11T12:13:00.000Z	Appl6	Smeh	And "file /usr/local/bin/vpnclient"?
2010-06-11T12:14:00.000Z	Appl6	Smeh	And "file /opt/cisco-vpnclient/bin/vpnclient"?
2010-06-11T12:22:00.000Z	Appl6	Smeh	Can you paste exactly what you get as output from "vpnclient", and then from "/usr/local/bin/vpnclient", and then from "/opt/cisco-vpnclient/bin/vpnclient"?
2010-06-11T12:22:00.000Z	Appl6	Smeh	And paste "echo $PATH" while you're at it.
2010-06-11T12:24:00.000Z	Smeh	Appl6	: sure, 2 sec.. this is a seperate machine to the linux box so might take a moment
2010-06-11T12:24:00.000Z	Appl6	Smeh	Of course, take your time.
2010-06-11T12:28:00.000Z	Appl6	Smeh	Even "/opt/cisco-vpnclient/bin/vpnclient" says "bash: /usr/local/bin/vpnclient: No such file or directory" ?
2010-06-11T12:28:00.000Z	Appl6	Smeh	Ha.  Can you pastebin the output of "alias", please?
2010-06-11T12:30:00.000Z	Smeh	Appl6	http://www.pastebin.com/NHXjQddS
2010-06-11T12:30:00.000Z	Appl6	Smeh	And the last thing I might try is to actually copy vpnclient from /opt to /usr/local/bin, not just symlink it.  And see if that helps.
2010-06-11T12:30:00.000Z	Appl6	Smeh	Just did, nothing special.
2010-06-11T12:32:00.000Z	Appl6	Smeh	That's really, really strange.  Let me think.
2010-06-11T12:35:00.000Z	Smeh	Appl6	i've got to scoot, hometime here and there is beer to be bought and such. Thanks for your help. I'll most likely be around on tuesday asking the same questions ;)
2010-06-11T12:35:00.000Z	Appl6	Smeh	Ha, OK, good luck with that.
