2005-02-10T11:57:00.000Z	LeeColleton		When I fullscreen firefox in Ubuntu, I still see the panel at the top.  how do I really fullscreen it?
2005-02-10T11:58:00.000Z	tritium	LeeColleton	View->Toolbars->Navigation Toolbar (uncheck it)
2005-02-10T11:59:00.000Z	LeeColleton	tritium	no, not the firefox toolbar, the gnome-panel
2005-02-10T11:59:00.000Z	tritium	LeeColleton	by panel, you mean the navigation toolbar?
2005-04-10T06:41:00.000Z	tritium	LeeColleton	for 18 months
2005-04-16T08:40:00.000Z	tritium	LeeColleton	try shift-pageup
2005-04-16T08:40:00.000Z	LeeColleton	tritium	just beeps
2005-04-16T08:41:00.000Z	tritium	LeeColleton	the screen manpage and docs don't have any info on it?
2005-04-16T08:43:00.000Z	LeeColleton	tritium	there's an option to output a hardcopy file of the session, which I could grep through...
2005-04-16T08:44:00.000Z	tritium	LeeColleton	I've not used it, so I'm afraid I'm not much help
2005-04-16T08:44:00.000Z	LeeColleton	tritium	it's a really handy way of leaving interactive terminal programs running (mplayer on a server, streamripper, et cetera)
2005-04-16T08:45:00.000Z	tritium	LeeColleton	yeah, so I've heard ;)
2005-09-22T11:32:00.000Z	tritium	LeeColleton	what does your question mean?
2005-09-22T11:34:00.000Z	LeeColleton	tritium	what are the standard dpkg selections for Breezy?  I can't find them listed anywhere.  I'm trying to use dpkg --set-selections to slim down my system.
2005-10-08T11:16:00.000Z	LeeColleton	tritium	isn'
2005-10-08T11:16:00.000Z	tritium	LeeColleton	what?
2005-10-08T11:16:00.000Z	LeeColleton	tritium	isn't that funny, why isn't this ubuntu-en ?
