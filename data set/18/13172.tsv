2007-09-07T11:43:00.000Z	Polygon89		how much ram do you have
2007-09-07T11:45:00.000Z	Polygon89		you dont need that much swap
2007-09-07T11:45:00.000Z	Polygon89		at the very least you need equal to the amount of ram you do
2007-09-07T11:45:00.000Z	Polygon89		no you dont :D
2007-09-07T11:45:00.000Z	Polygon89		if you want to suspend to ram you need a swap partition equal to your ram
2007-09-07T11:46:00.000Z	Polygon89		so bourne what im suggesting
2007-09-07T11:48:00.000Z	cast	Polygon89	you don't *need* swap ;)
2007-09-07T11:49:00.000Z	cast	Polygon89	you probably only want swap
2007-09-07T11:49:00.000Z	Polygon89	cast	you dont need it but if you want to suspend, and if linux ever runs out of ram your screwed without it
2007-09-07T11:50:00.000Z	cast	Polygon89	you can run out of ram with swap too :)
2007-09-07T11:50:00.000Z	Polygon89	cast	but its harder
2007-09-07T12:02:00.000Z	cast	Polygon89	and isos. and backups. and video.
2007-09-07T12:02:00.000Z	Polygon89	cast	backup programs are usually smart enough to split backups into 4 gb chunks
2007-09-07T12:03:00.000Z	Polygon89	cast	i also have entire dvds that are less then a GB on my hard drive, so i think he is fine
2007-09-07T12:04:00.000Z	cast	Polygon89	that makes no sense...a dual layer dvd is 8.5GB, a single layer 4.7GB
2007-09-07T12:05:00.000Z	Polygon89	cast	as in a dvd ripped as a video file, less then 1 gb
2007-09-07T12:05:00.000Z	Polygon89	cast	not a actual dvd iso
2007-09-07T12:08:00.000Z	cast	Polygon89	FWIW you didn't just rip, you ripped and performed lossy compression...
