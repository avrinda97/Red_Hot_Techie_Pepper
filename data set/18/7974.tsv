2007-10-19T14:29:00.000Z	yellow_chicken		i am installing tftpd-hpa using synpatic, but it says, it's not authenticated.  anyone have experience with this?
2007-10-19T14:31:00.000Z	wildintellect	yellow_chicken	it's not big deal if it's not auth, depending on the repo you're getting it from there may be a cert you can download
2007-10-19T14:32:00.000Z	yellow_chicken	wildintellect	what't the command to update package list? i can't download tftp-hpa.
2007-10-19T14:33:00.000Z	wildintellect	yellow_chicken	sudo apt-get update
2007-10-19T14:35:00.000Z	yellow_chicken	wildintellect	i think the repository is dead, i clicked apply, nothing happens
2007-10-19T14:36:00.000Z	wildintellect	yellow_chicken	think about changes your sources to a different mirrot
2007-10-19T14:36:00.000Z	yellow_chicken	wildintellect	how to make change?
2007-10-19T14:37:00.000Z	yellow_chicken	wildintellect	tftp-hpa is part of main-group.
2007-10-19T14:37:00.000Z	wildintellect	yellow_chicken	you can either edit /etc/apt/sources.list (backup files first)
