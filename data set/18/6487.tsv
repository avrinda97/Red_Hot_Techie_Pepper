2008-06-09T12:07:00.000Z	joaopinto	jerkface03	please describe your problem/question
2008-06-09T12:08:00.000Z	joaopinto	jerkface03	sudo apt-get ubuntu-desktop (it will install more than you need)
2008-06-09T12:08:00.000Z	joaopinto	jerkface03	sudo apt-get install install build-essential whateverpackage-youneed-dev
2008-06-09T12:09:00.000Z	joaopinto	jerkface03	run run a X app over ssh you dont need a xserver, you need the X client libraries, the exact librarires depend on the apps that you are going to run
2008-06-09T12:11:00.000Z	joaopinto	jerkface03	if you want to develop x apps, you just need to install the -dev package for whatever graphical toolkit you are going to use, again you do not need the xserver libs
2008-06-09T12:12:00.000Z	joaopinto	jerkface03	uh ? installing a package has nothing to do with ssh tunneling, ssh tunneling is something that YOU setup with your ssh client
2008-06-09T12:12:00.000Z	jerkface03	joaopinto	can you please provide me with a link with the relevant instructions
2008-06-09T12:13:00.000Z	joaopinto	jerkface03	first let me tell that it's a very bad idea do do X apps development using a remote display
2008-06-09T12:13:00.000Z	jerkface03	joaopinto	i know it's the best idea in the world, but i'm trying to save myself another ubuntu install
2008-06-09T12:14:00.000Z	joaopinto	jerkface03	if you are using a linux client, ssh -X, if you are using putty just enable the X11 forwarding option
2008-06-09T12:16:00.000Z	joaopinto	jerkface03	if you are using dapper you must change your sorces.lst to use old.releases.ubuntu.com
2008-06-09T13:33:00.000Z	joaopinto	jerkface03	ssh-server is not installed by default
2008-06-09T13:43:00.000Z	jerkface03	joaopinto	neither command you gave me is working
2008-06-09T13:43:00.000Z	joaopinto	jerkface03	does "sudo ls" work ?
2008-06-09T13:44:00.000Z	joaopinto	jerkface03	ps -ef | grep ssh
2008-06-09T15:42:00.000Z	joaopinto	jerkface03	sudo apt-get install build-essential
