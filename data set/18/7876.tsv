2007-11-21T06:00:00.000Z	_Johny	windego40	What's your problem precisely?
2007-11-21T06:02:00.000Z	_Johny	windego40	Are u trying to do it by in remote?
2007-11-21T06:03:00.000Z	_Johny	windego40	What did you mean by saying you're trying to mount your ipod from the forums?
2007-11-21T06:04:00.000Z	windego40	_Johny	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PortableDevices/iPhone im using that guide
2007-11-21T06:09:00.000Z	_Johny	windego40	Did you put the IP adress?
2007-11-21T06:10:00.000Z	windego40	_Johny	yeah i put everything it says but it says im missing host and dont know how to add that into the command
2007-11-21T06:13:00.000Z	_Johny	windego40	I'd try "man sshfs|grep -i host" So you can see what's the host in the command meaning
2007-11-21T06:15:00.000Z	_Johny	windego40	No, no man for that. Can you just paste the entire command, just as you put it?
2007-11-21T06:17:00.000Z	_Johny	windego40	If you don't know what a given command mean, put "whatis <command>", that's should be shorter and easier
2007-11-21T06:22:00.000Z	_Johny	windego40	try this way ;  sshfs root@192.168.2.9:/var/root/Media/ /media/ipod/
2007-11-21T06:23:00.000Z	windego40	_Johny	its doing doing that ping thing
2007-11-21T06:23:00.000Z	_Johny	windego40	Does the error pop up  anymore?
2007-11-21T06:25:00.000Z	windego40	_Johny	it hasnt stopped that ping command i ran

2007-11-21T06:29:00.000Z	windego40	_Johny	ok ill try what it says
2007-11-21T06:31:00.000Z	_Johny	windego40	I'll have to go by in a moment, I'm afraid I can't help you with this issue. If you had to, you could try to paste the error texe in google , along with ("), maybe someone has alredy had this problem. Good luck anyway -:)
2007-11-21T06:32:00.000Z	windego40	_Johny	ok thanks a lot for the help though
