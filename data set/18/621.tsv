2011-11-26T09:38:00.000Z	r|ck		hi, i just performed a dist upgrade of my ubuntu
2011-11-26T09:38:00.000Z	r|ck		and once it completed and attempted to boot up, its stalls at the bootup
2011-11-26T09:38:00.000Z	r|ck		"Starting configure network device security"
2011-11-26T09:38:00.000Z	r|ck		thats where it is at now
2011-11-26T09:39:00.000Z	r|ck		i have gone to the diff rc levels and event /etc/default and already disabled at least 20 different stuff
2011-11-26T09:39:00.000Z	r|ck		kinda tired of doing that
2011-11-26T09:39:00.000Z	r|ck		wondering if is there a way of fixing it and perhaps why im getting that
2011-11-26T09:40:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	r|ck	does your system hang if you boot from a live cd of the same version?
2011-11-26T09:42:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	r|ck	I would try the Liive CD to see if it also hangs at the same point... How did you install your system if not from a Live CD?
2011-11-26T09:42:00.000Z	r|ck	pragmaticenigma	i had a previous version installed and it prompted to do a distribution upgrade
2011-11-26T09:43:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	r|ck	I see... it's possible that your previous installation had some custom configuration that the upgrade didn't carry over?
2011-11-26T09:44:00.000Z	r|ck	pragmaticenigma	yeah, that could be a possibility
2011-11-26T09:45:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	r|ck	I usually download the Live CD before doing the upgrade just to make sure it will run
2011-11-26T09:45:00.000Z	r|ck	pragmaticenigma	ouhh.. ic. i guess next time i shall do that
2011-11-26T09:46:00.000Z	r|ck	pragmaticenigma	downloading the iso now and will take another 30 mins to download
2011-11-26T09:46:00.000Z	pragmaticenigma	r|ck	okay, I have to head off shortly... but I'm sure others here can continue to help you
2011-11-26T09:47:00.000Z	r|ck	pragmaticenigma	orite. sure
2011-11-26T09:47:00.000Z	r|ck	pragmaticenigma	thanks for ur help. :)
