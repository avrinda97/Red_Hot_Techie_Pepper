2010-09-01T15:09:00.000Z	Name141		is FGLRX the best ATi driver for the 4670?
2010-09-01T15:10:00.000Z	Name141		or is there one that would provide better 3D support?
2010-09-01T15:11:00.000Z	linux_inferno	Name141	hehe I was in your boat... Have fun!
2010-09-01T15:11:00.000Z	linux_inferno	Name141	I got tf2 working
2010-09-01T15:12:00.000Z	Name141	linux_inferno	how so?  I think I might have to stick to XP
2010-09-01T15:12:00.000Z	linux_inferno		ewwwww xp
2010-09-01T15:12:00.000Z	Name141		and you'd rather run that total pile of junk they call 7?
2010-09-01T15:13:00.000Z	linux_inferno		No I'd rather run ubuntu jeez
2010-09-01T15:13:00.000Z	Name141		OK .  So how did you fix it?
2010-09-01T15:14:00.000Z	linux_inferno		but win7 does a good job.  Oh, mine wasn't choppy, I have dual quad xeons, 24gb of ram, and 2 gtx 470 cards
2010-09-01T15:14:00.000Z	Name141	linux_inferno	I didn't mean choppy as in FPS.. I meant choppy as in something didn't look like it displayed properly
2010-09-01T15:14:00.000Z	linux_inferno	Name141	like what?
2010-09-01T15:14:00.000Z	Name141		and I'm not sure what a nVidia has to do with ATi
2010-09-01T15:15:00.000Z	linux_inferno	Name141	like video corruption?
2010-09-01T15:15:00.000Z	Name141	linux_inferno	I guess.  It didn't display the Gman right
2010-09-01T15:15:00.000Z	Name141		was flashing more than anything
2010-09-01T15:15:00.000Z	linux_inferno		Hmmm... I'll dig around
2010-09-01T15:18:00.000Z	Name141	linux_inferno	the people in winehq look dead
