2010-12-27T10:11:00.000Z	r000t_laptop		If I use 'ln -s ~/folder ~/secondfolder/folder' and ~/folder already exists, will it overwrite it?
2010-12-27T10:12:00.000Z	rww	r000t_laptop	no. See 'man ln', it goes into detail about this in the Description section.
2010-12-27T10:13:00.000Z	rww	r000t_laptop	in short, if you /want/ it to overwrite, use ln -fs
2010-12-27T10:14:00.000Z	rww	r000t_laptop	ah, yeah. if it's a directory, it'
2010-12-27T10:14:00.000Z	rww	r000t_laptop	... 'd do that.
2010-12-27T10:15:00.000Z	rww	r000t_laptop	is the backup folder also named .gconf?
2010-12-27T10:15:00.000Z	r000t_laptop	rww	yes
2010-12-27T10:16:00.000Z	r000t_laptop	rww	In fact the backup folder keeps exact structure even if the link is inside a subfolder (EG, I link ~/Downloads/folder, Downloads is created in the backup folder to mantain structure
2010-12-27T10:17:00.000Z	rww	r000t_laptop	"ln -fs path/to/backup/.gconf" will create a symlink in the current directory named ".gconf" that points to path/to/backup/.gconf, and attempt to unlink any existing .gconf in the current directory first
2010-12-27T10:17:00.000Z	r000t_laptop	rww	thanks!
2010-12-27T10:19:00.000Z	r000t_laptop	rww	I'm doing this to a lot of .folders. Are there any (that come with Ubuntu) that will cause problems if I take the current version (after a month of usage) and drop it into a new install?
2010-12-27T10:20:00.000Z	rww	r000t_laptop	I don't know. I've never encountered problems, but I usually only restore a handful of dotfolders that I know I want (.ssh, .gnupg, not settings stuff like .gconf)
2010-12-27T10:21:00.000Z	r000t_laptop	rww	the goal is that I back up enough things and keep a record of manually installed packages, so I run this one script and it creates the links and reinstalls the packages, and it's like nothing happened
2010-12-27T10:22:00.000Z	rww	r000t_laptop	I'd probably just copy them over instead. Symlinking seems overly complex :\
2010-12-27T10:22:00.000Z	r000t_laptop	rww	I'd do that too, but the point behind the symlinking is that any change is automatically put in Dropbox
2010-12-27T10:33:00.000Z	rww	r000t_laptop	zenity should be able to do that. "zenity --info", perhaps?
2010-12-27T10:34:00.000Z	r000t_laptop	rww	I want to customize it. Like, I want to pass a string to it and have that be the message
2010-12-27T10:34:00.000Z	rww	r000t_laptop	you can do that. see zenity's manpage ;)
