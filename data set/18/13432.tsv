2006-04-09T05:44:00.000Z	painkiler	oskude	thats not what im looking for
2006-04-09T05:45:00.000Z	oskude	painkiler	are you using breezy ? it should be mounted automaticly, no ?
2006-04-09T05:46:00.000Z	oskude	painkiler	you have more than 1 partition on your ipod ?
2006-04-09T05:47:00.000Z	oskude	painkiler	and what filesystem does that sde3 partition have ?
2006-04-09T05:47:00.000Z	oskude	painkiler	then do what healot just said, it shows the partition list
2006-04-09T05:48:00.000Z	oskude	painkiler	is it a fresh partition ?
2006-04-09T05:48:00.000Z	oskude	painkiler	did you format it ?
2006-04-09T05:48:00.000Z	oskude	painkiler	i mean, if you partitioned it by yourself, you have to allso format it before you can use it
2006-04-09T05:50:00.000Z	oskude	painkiler	or a "short cut" "mkfs.ext3"
2006-04-09T05:52:00.000Z	painkiler	oskude	what is this mkfs.ext3?
2006-04-09T05:52:00.000Z	oskude	painkiler	maybe posting your fdisk -l to pastebin could help...
2006-04-09T05:52:00.000Z	oskude	painkiler	it formats a ext3 partition
2006-04-09T05:53:00.000Z	oskude	painkiler	and if you type "mkfs.<tab><tab>" you get a list of many fs types to format....
2006-04-09T05:55:00.000Z	oskude	painkiler	that first partition (empty) looks strange...
2006-04-09T05:56:00.000Z	oskude	painkiler	well, i dont know nothing about ipods, so dunno if you can use them as (i do) "normal" flash drive...
2006-04-09T05:57:00.000Z	painkiler	oskude	found the ipod linux channel
2006-04-09T05:57:00.000Z	oskude	painkiler	ok :)
