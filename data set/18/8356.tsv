2007-09-08T09:59:00.000Z	tparcina	rob_p	can you recommend one sftp?
2007-09-08T09:59:00.000Z	rob_p	tparcina	I use cmdline sftp.
2007-09-08T09:59:00.000Z	rob_p	tparcina	...but I'm sure there are graphical ones out there.
2007-09-08T10:00:00.000Z	rob_p	tparcina	From a windows box, you can use winscp.
2007-09-08T10:00:00.000Z	tparcina	rob_p	I don't need graphical, I'll try that one. what's package name - sftp?
2007-09-08T10:00:00.000Z	rob_p	tparcina	man sftp
2007-09-08T10:01:00.000Z	rob_p	tparcina	You should already have it.
2007-09-08T10:01:00.000Z	tparcina	rob_p	what's winscp?
2007-09-08T10:01:00.000Z	tparcina	rob_p	ok, I'll try sftp. thank you
2007-09-08T10:02:00.000Z	rob_p	tparcina	WinSCP is a windows client that supports scp, sftp, etc. in case you need to transfer files using a windows box.
2007-09-08T10:03:00.000Z	rob_p	tparcina	It's what my clients use to access their content on my server.
2007-09-08T10:03:00.000Z	rob_p	tparcina	Anyway, good luck.
2007-09-08T10:03:00.000Z	tparcina	rob_p	dug: thank you both. If I stuck somwhere I'll contact channel.

2007-09-08T10:04:00.000Z	tparcina	rob_p	will I need it? (luck)
2007-09-08T10:04:00.000Z	rob_p	tparcina	Naw... it's cake!  :-)
