2009-03-18T04:15:00.000Z	Gnea		don't even need the z anymore, at least not on Ubuntu
2009-03-18T04:17:00.000Z	Gnea		:)
2009-03-18T04:18:00.000Z	Gnea		pulseaudio is quirky, at best... usually takes a bit of work to get it to work right
2009-03-18T04:20:00.000Z	Gnea		!pulseaudio
2009-03-18T04:22:00.000Z	Gnea		echo_mirage: o.O  that's strange... have you tried going at it from the commandline?

2009-03-18T04:24:00.000Z	felixsulla	Gnea	I know what it IS.
2009-03-18T04:25:00.000Z	Gnea	felixsulla	pardon?
2009-03-18T04:42:00.000Z	Gnea	felixsulla	so fix it
2009-03-18T04:43:00.000Z	felixsulla	Gnea	?
2009-03-18T04:43:00.000Z	Gnea	felixsulla	what do you mean, ?? this is linux, it means that, if you don't like the way something works, you change it and make it work better. :)
2009-03-18T04:44:00.000Z	felixsulla	Gnea	Only I didnt code VBox so I'm not in much of a position to change it. Besides, I think the technology is good, its just poorly documented.
2009-03-18T04:44:00.000Z	Gnea	felixsulla	the documentation is always open to re-interpretation
2009-03-18T04:45:00.000Z	felixsulla	Gnea	If I get a good system going for backups I'll post my own tutorial :)
2009-03-18T04:46:00.000Z	Gnea	felixsulla	:D
2009-03-18T04:46:00.000Z	felixsulla	Gnea	But first I have to understand it myself.. heh
2009-03-18T04:46:00.000Z	Gnea	felixsulla	by all means... :)
