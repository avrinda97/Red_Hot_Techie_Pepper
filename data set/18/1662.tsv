2011-03-30T04:11:00.000Z	gsfai		i am currently 100% confused
2011-03-30T04:12:00.000Z	gsfai		How the hell can my system have no device file for the sound output and for the microphone input?
2011-03-30T04:12:00.000Z	gsfai		i mean it is starting to get annoying
2011-03-30T04:12:00.000Z	NewWorld	gsfai	 You have no /dev/dsp
2011-03-30T04:14:00.000Z	NewWorld	gsfai	 You are massively fucked xD
2011-03-30T04:15:00.000Z	gsfai	NewWorld	it doesnt even make sense, 90% of the programs can play music, and record stuff... i just seem to be unable to do it myself or with the remaining 10%
2011-03-30T04:15:00.000Z	NewWorld	gsfai	 What is your sound daemon?
2011-03-30T04:15:00.000Z	gsfai	NewWorld	lsmod?
2011-03-30T04:16:00.000Z	NewWorld	gsfai	 PulseAudio, Alsa, JACK?
2011-03-30T04:17:00.000Z	NewWorld	gsfai	 Maybe they are conflicting with each other :S why do you need them all?
2011-03-30T04:17:00.000Z	gsfai	NewWorld	well i dont know, i just remember being able to work with all of them
2011-03-30T04:19:00.000Z	NewWorld	gsfai	 What are you trying to play sound in and it's not working?
2011-03-30T04:19:00.000Z	gsfai	NewWorld	sound from tuxguitar, but the basic problem, is that i NEED a device file to record from!
2011-03-30T04:27:00.000Z	NewWorld	gsfai	 Maybe the file is /dev/audio ? Have you looked through /dev/ thouroughly?
2011-03-30T04:28:00.000Z	gsfai	NewWorld	yeap
2011-03-30T04:28:00.000Z	NewWorld	gsfai	 Why don't you pastebin 'ls -al /dev'
2011-03-30T04:29:00.000Z	gsfai	NewWorld	im going to sleep, ill do it tomorrow!
2011-03-30T04:29:00.000Z	NewWorld	gsfai	 qtconfig. OK good night
