2005-04-13T16:45:00.000Z	grogoreo	delire	I've looked
2005-04-13T16:46:00.000Z	delire	grogoreo	time to make one!
2006-04-15T16:53:00.000Z	delire	grogoreo	you can set this in your ~/.bashrc. uncomment the line with "ls --color=auto"
2006-04-15T16:53:00.000Z	delire	grogoreo	then 'source ~/.bashrc' and you're done.
2006-04-15T16:53:00.000Z	grogoreo	delire	thanks man. I'll give it a go
2006-04-15T16:56:00.000Z	grogoreo	delire	I don't have a file .bashrc so I'll create it, inserting    "ls --color=auto"    but do I need the quotes? Do I type    source ~/.bashrc    in the shell?
2006-04-15T16:58:00.000Z	delire	grogoreo	hmm you don't have a ~/.bashrc? right.. just create it and create a line like so: alias ls='ls --color=auto'
2006-04-15T16:59:00.000Z	delire	grogoreo	you should have an example bashrc in /etc/bash.bashrc
2006-04-15T16:59:00.000Z	grogoreo	delire	thank you
2006-04-15T16:59:00.000Z	delire	grogoreo	anytime.. i'm on Debian here by the way, so you may want to search for that example rc if it's not in that location. i forget where it is in Ubuntu.
2006-04-15T05:01:00.000Z	grogoreo	delire	I have just opened it but it says it's a system wide file, so is there any point in me copying it? Like it has a part for sudo etc
2006-04-15T05:05:00.000Z	delire	grogoreo	copy it to ~/.bashrc - that will work fine.
2006-04-15T05:05:00.000Z	grogoreo	delire	ok thanks again. I'll add the alias part as well
2006-04-15T05:06:00.000Z	delire	grogoreo	yep, this file will be for that user only. you'll need to put it in /root/ for sudo operations to have the same highlights and aliases you like.
2006-04-15T05:06:00.000Z	delire	grogoreo	eg /root/.bashrc. i'd post mine but it's a mile long as have very particular aliases ;)
2006-04-15T05:07:00.000Z	grogoreo	delire	hehe
