2009-08-07T09:17:00.000Z	carpediem		the stuff in event.d doesn't contain the scripts
2009-08-07T09:18:00.000Z	carpediem		the stuff in event.d just calls the scripts in rc.d
2009-08-07T09:18:00.000Z	cprevoe	carpediem	yes but there are some that arn't in the rc's, such as logd
2009-08-07T09:19:00.000Z	carpediem	cprevoe	perhaps, not sure.  but rc.d is not just for show.  IF you manually put something in rc.d it will run
2009-08-07T09:20:00.000Z	cprevoe	carpediem	but it will only run because of the respective rcX script in /etc/event.d
2009-08-07T09:20:00.000Z	carpediem	cprevoe	yes, that's right.
2009-08-07T09:20:00.000Z	carpediem	cprevoe	but the respective script only is a loop that runs the contents of rcX.d
2009-08-07T09:21:00.000Z	cprevoe	carpediem	you're right, it's not just there for show
2009-08-07T09:21:00.000Z	carpediem	cprevoe	in other words, the scripts in rcX.d only exist in that place (though they are usually a simlink to /etc/init.d)
2009-08-07T09:22:00.000Z	cprevoe	carpediem	right, but if you create a new project, should you be using the rc?.d or entering a script int /etc/event.d?
2009-08-07T09:23:00.000Z	carpediem	cprevoe	actually, to do it right, you put it in init.d and run rc-update
2009-08-07T09:23:00.000Z	carpediem	cprevoe	rc-update puts the appropriate simlinks in to /etc/rcX.d
2009-08-07T09:29:00.000Z	cprevoe	carpediem	/etc/event.d is part of "upstart" ... it's goal is ambitious
2009-08-07T09:29:00.000Z	carpediem	cprevoe	ahh, okay, I've read about upstart.
2009-08-07T09:29:00.000Z	carpediem	cprevoe	but it looks like for the most part, upstart is just processing rcX.d entries based on the scripts I'm seeing. :/
2009-08-07T09:31:00.000Z	cprevoe	carpediem	absolutely, and I think the fact that you and I just had a conv about it
2009-08-07T09:31:00.000Z	cprevoe	carpediem	means maybe it needs some more pushing
2009-08-07T09:32:00.000Z	carpediem	cprevoe	true
