2009-07-21T07:17:00.000Z	mikebot		I am having a problem using ImageWriter to make a bootable USB drive with UNR if anyone thinks that they can help me with this.
2009-07-21T07:18:00.000Z	click_here	mikebot	have you tried: http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/
2009-07-21T07:19:00.000Z	mikebot	click_here	I was actually following https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UNR/Installation/Easy
2009-07-21T07:20:00.000Z	mikebot	click_here	DO you think that I should abandon that tutorial and try the one you linked to?
2009-07-21T07:20:00.000Z	click_here	mikebot	are you using ubuntu to create the usb  flash drive?
2009-07-21T07:20:00.000Z	mikebot	click_here	Yes.
2009-07-21T07:21:00.000Z	mikebot	click_here	And I tried the IMageWriter software from both that tutorial page and an (apparently) upgraded version from the Package Manager
2009-07-21T07:21:00.000Z	click_here	mikebot	what did you say you are trying to put on the USB?
2009-07-21T07:22:00.000Z	mikebot	click_here	A copy of Ubuntu Netbook Remix (ubuntu-9.04-netbook-remix-i386.img)
2009-07-21T07:23:00.000Z	click_here	mikebot	i'm pretty sure that you can use the software I linked to.  it takes like 2 seconds with that program
2009-07-21T07:23:00.000Z	mikebot	click_here	OK, I'll try that, thank you.
2009-07-21T07:25:00.000Z	mikebot	click_here	I can't open that file.
2009-07-21T07:26:00.000Z	click_here	mikebot	hmm..  i used this program on a windows machine to then create the USB boot drive for the ubuntu OS.  so i'll have to look at it real quick
2009-07-21T07:27:00.000Z	mikebot	click_here	OK. Also, the image I have for UNR is a .img, not a .iso
2009-07-21T07:31:00.000Z	click_here	mikebot	have you tried the ubuntu installation tutorial?  hmm.. i just figured if you had XP running you could have it done in no time.  not sure how much time it'll take you this way
2009-07-21T07:31:00.000Z	mikebot	click_here	Yeah, I have the ImageWriter program, but for some reason it isn't installing on my flash drive.
2009-07-21T07:32:00.000Z	click_here	mikebot	i unfortunately  do not have experience with that program
2009-07-21T07:32:00.000Z	mikebot	click_here	OK, that's alright. Thanks for trying to help.
