2005-08-23T08:39:00.000Z	roham_		If i wanna update GAIM, can I download the newiest version and just do the ./configure and make ? I dont need to uninstall the old version first?
2005-08-23T08:40:00.000Z	Karhuton	roham_	if you configure it to install it to /usr/local, then no
2005-08-23T08:42:00.000Z	roham_	Karhuton	why local? its the one that comes with Ubuntu... and I think its in /usr/bin
2005-08-23T08:42:00.000Z	roham_	Karhuton	so I need to uninstall it first?
2005-08-23T08:43:00.000Z	Karhuton	roham_	it's good to install all locally compiled stuff into /usr/local
2005-08-23T08:43:00.000Z	roham_	Karhuton	ok... but it dosnt do it by default right? I need to define it when I do the make?
2005-08-23T08:43:00.000Z	Karhuton	roham_	depending on your PATH env variable, the binarys in /usr/local/bin are preferred over /usr/bin etc.
2005-08-23T08:44:00.000Z	Karhuton	roham_	Type "./configure --help" It usually tells you how
2005-08-23T08:44:00.000Z	Karhuton	roham_	Also ALWAYS read the 'README' or 'INSTALL' files when compiling
2005-08-23T08:44:00.000Z	Karhuton	roham_	some developers like to use different systems
2005-08-23T08:44:00.000Z	Karhuton	roham_	but propably ./configure --prefix=/usr/local works
2005-08-23T08:45:00.000Z	roham_	Karhuton	why dosnt ubuntu put the new gaim version in apt-get?
2005-08-23T08:45:00.000Z	Karhuton	roham_	then when you want to start the 'new' gaim, just run /usr/local/bin/gaim
2005-08-23T08:45:00.000Z	Karhuton	roham_	or use a backport :)
2005-08-23T08:46:00.000Z	roham_	Karhuton	hehe whats backport ? :P <-newbie
2005-08-23T08:49:00.000Z	Karhuton	roham_	that's because you don't know how librarys and software versions work
2005-08-23T08:50:00.000Z	Karhuton	roham_	backports means just newer versions of the apps you like made compatible for the older system you're using
2005-08-23T08:50:00.000Z	roham_	Karhuton	I even dont know if its a webpage or application that show me that info
