2005-09-02T11:05:00.000Z	__filip_		i have 4 partions on my harddrive. i have heard that it is impossibel to make more then 4 partions. is that right?
2005-09-02T11:06:00.000Z	__filip_		so i cant make any more partitions?
2005-09-02T11:06:00.000Z	pfp	__filip_	it's impossible to make >4 primary partitions, but if one of them is an extended partition, it can contain as many logical partitions as you want
2005-09-02T11:07:00.000Z	__filip_	pfp	how can i look if thay are logical then?
2005-09-02T11:07:00.000Z	pfp	__filip_	logical partitions are numbered from 5 ->
2005-09-02T11:07:00.000Z	pfp	__filip_	even if you have lessa than 4 primary partitions
2005-09-02T11:09:00.000Z	__filip_	pfp	i have hda1 hda3 hda4 and hda5 so then i can make one more partition?
2005-09-02T11:09:00.000Z	pfp	__filip_	yep
2005-09-02T11:10:00.000Z	__filip_	pfp	how? i whant to make an 2 gb partition. it should take the space from hda5.
2005-09-02T11:12:00.000Z	pfp	__filip_	gparted (or qtparted too i guess) should be able to shrink hda5 to make room for hda6, but you can't do it while hda5 is in use
2005-09-02T11:14:00.000Z	__filip_	pfp	how can i run them?
2005-09-02T11:14:00.000Z	pfp	__filip_	incidentally, i tried to shrink a partition w/ gparted yesterday but it refused to co-operate, so caveat emptor... also, *take* *backups* ;;)
2005-09-02T11:15:00.000Z	pfp	__filip_	apt-get install gparted ; it's found in applications-systemtoolssomething-gparted
2005-09-02T11:19:00.000Z	pfp	__filip_	if hda5 doesn't have _any_ data on it now, that is
2005-09-02T11:22:00.000Z	pfp	__filip_	actually, you can d(elete) 5 and then create new 5 and 6 in one go
2005-09-02T11:24:00.000Z	pfp	__filip_	ok, in that case you can try to shrink hda5 with gparted, _in_theory_ that will not touch your data
2005-09-02T12:13:00.000Z	pfp	__filip_	i'd edit /etc/fstab and copy and existing line
2005-09-02T12:13:00.000Z	__filip_	pfp	what? i dont understand what you saying.
