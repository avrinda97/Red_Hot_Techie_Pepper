2012-11-08T21:53:00.000Z	SnowmanX11		Hi Guys! I have been effected by the bug in 12.04, because DVD is not automounted. Does somebody know a workaround? (It is definetly not a hardware error. It is tested.)
2012-11-08T21:55:00.000Z	SnowmanX11		tada
2012-11-08T21:56:00.000Z	escott	SnowmanX11	what is the output of "groups"
2012-11-08T21:56:00.000Z	SnowmanX11	escott	snowmanx11 adm cdrom sudo dip plugdev lpadmin sambashare
2012-11-08T21:58:00.000Z	escott	SnowmanX11	that looks fine. when you put the DVD in what is the output of "mount"
2012-11-08T21:58:00.000Z	SnowmanX11	escott	nothing regarding to cdrom
2012-11-08T21:59:00.000Z	SnowmanX11	escott	if I use k3b than everything is correctly mounted and able to eject
2012-11-08T21:59:00.000Z	escott	SnowmanX11	does udisks --mount /dev/sr0 mount the dvd
2012-11-08T21:59:00.000Z	SnowmanX11	escott	sometimes the mount work and dvd starts, but it is very rare
2012-11-08T22:00:00.000Z	SnowmanX11	escott	Mount failed: Error mounting: mount: no medium found on /dev/sr0
2012-11-08T22:01:00.000Z	SnowmanX11	escott	this is what I get usually
2012-11-08T22:01:00.000Z	escott	SnowmanX11	try /dev/dvd not sure what the device is
2012-11-08T22:01:00.000Z	SnowmanX11	escott	same with dvd cdrom etc...
2012-11-08T22:02:00.000Z	SnowmanX11	escott	it is a known bug in 12.04
2012-11-08T22:02:00.000Z	escott	SnowmanX11	ok. then follow the bug report i guess
2012-11-08T22:02:00.000Z	SnowmanX11	escott	I had a well working 12.04. I have upgraded to 12.10 but it failed due to ATI vs new Xorg issue. Downgraded to 12.04 have this bug
2012-11-08T22:03:00.000Z	SnowmanX11	escott	bug reports are not guiding
2012-11-08T22:09:00.000Z	SnowmanX11	escott	any other idea?
