2005-07-09T16:18:00.000Z	mig`		i'm about to install ubuntu from the dvd, however in order for it to work, i am going to have to make sure the initrd file loads usb2.0 drivers (so that the kernel can find the hdd where i'm going to install ubuntu to), is there a way to do this from the installer? or do i have to install ubuntu, then boot into the livecd and recompile the initrd file?
2005-07-09T16:18:00.000Z	mig`		please someone help me, its the only thing keeping me from using ubuntu at the moment, and i want to use ubuntu
2005-07-09T16:19:00.000Z	mig`		i dont know how to make an initrd file, or (better yet) can i specify built in usb 2.0 support into the kernel?
2005-07-09T16:19:00.000Z	mig`		(from the installer)
2005-07-09T16:21:00.000Z	concept10	mig`	you are trying to install to usb external drive?
2005-07-09T16:21:00.000Z	mig`	concept10	correct
2005-07-09T16:21:00.000Z	concept10	mig`	why not internal and forget the hassle?
2005-07-09T16:21:00.000Z	mig`	concept10	internal is windows (which i use for work), plus i'd like to walk with my ubuntu installation
2005-07-09T16:22:00.000Z	concept10	mig`	bios must support booting from USB, check the wiki, someone wrote a page up, you just have to look around
2005-07-09T16:22:00.000Z	mig`	concept10	the problem is that after 'linux is uncompressed' i can't get past pivot_root
2005-07-09T16:23:00.000Z	mig`	concept10	my bios does all of this
2005-07-09T16:25:00.000Z	mig`	concept10	you have any idea where i should look in the wiki?
2005-07-09T16:25:00.000Z	concept10	mig`	usb install
2005-07-09T16:26:00.000Z	concept10	mig`	http://www.google.com/search?q=install+ubuntu+usb&sourceid=mozilla-search&start=0&start=0&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:unofficial
2005-07-09T16:35:00.000Z	mig`	concept10	how about if i just go with the regular install, but boot into the live environment after install, mount up the hard drive, and re-make the initrd file to load up the usb driver ?
2005-07-09T16:36:00.000Z	concept10	mig`	sounds like a plan, but I cant help you with that one
2005-07-09T16:38:00.000Z	concept10	mig`	yes
