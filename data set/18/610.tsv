2011-11-29T05:19:00.000Z	LivTyler	nixxofugi	and the question is ...
2011-11-29T05:22:00.000Z	nixxofugi	LivTyler	were you able to see my issue ...
2011-11-29T05:25:00.000Z	LivTyler	nixxofugi	which server are you using? try x11vnc server and configure a shared session
2011-11-29T05:25:00.000Z	LivTyler	nixxofugi	shared session means two users can interact with the same desktop
2011-11-29T05:26:00.000Z	LivTyler	nixxofugi	at the same time
2011-11-29T05:27:00.000Z	LivTyler	nixxofugi	don't you have Xwindow access?
2011-11-29T05:27:00.000Z	LivTyler	nixxofugi	there's a graphical wizard
2011-11-29T05:28:00.000Z	nixxofugi	LivTyler	i don't see it
2011-11-29T05:29:00.000Z	nixxofugi	LivTyler	actually, i get a display of the screen, but i am unable to interact with it. is this an xdamage issue?
2011-11-29T05:31:00.000Z	LivTyler	nixxofugi	I don't think so, just try x11vnc -shared
2011-11-29T05:31:00.000Z	LivTyler	nixxofugi	there are some many options, I do prefer using the graphical assistant
2011-11-29T05:33:00.000Z	LivTyler	nixxofugi	Yes, I have it in the Internet menu
2011-11-29T05:33:00.000Z	LivTyler	nixxofugi	:) I use 10.04
2011-11-29T05:38:00.000Z	nixxofugi	LivTyler	i found the gui and i set the shared option. but still no luck. unable to control the workspace, although i can see it
2011-11-29T05:49:00.000Z	LivTyler	nixxofugi	are you using sudo?
2011-11-29T05:55:00.000Z	nixxofugi	LivTyler	the weird thing is that i can move the mouse and watch it move, but unfortunately it won't click on anything
2011-11-29T05:56:00.000Z	nixxofugi	LivTyler	i'm going to give up for a few hours... dinner time. thanks for your help this far
