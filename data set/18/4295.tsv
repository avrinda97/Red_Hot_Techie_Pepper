2012-04-30T15:07:00.000Z	ogra_	Darael	thats the case if you use tasks instead of metapackages
2012-04-30T15:08:00.000Z	ogra_	Darael	sudo apt-get install ubuntu-standard vs. sudo apt-get install ubuntu-standard^   .... (or tasksel install ubuntu-standard)
2012-04-30T15:09:00.000Z	ogra_	Darael	the first one sets them to manual, the tow latter ones set them to automatic
2012-04-30T15:09:00.000Z	Darael	ogra_	Are you sure that's the right way round?  Because I installed with the minimal CD, and used the tasksel in that...
2012-04-30T15:10:00.000Z	ogra_	Darael	yes, thats what we use to create the images
2012-04-30T15:10:00.000Z	ogra_	Darael	(though we only use apt-get at creation time, not sure, tasksel might have a bug in that regard)
2012-04-30T15:11:00.000Z	Darael	ogra_	Hang on.  I'm confused now.  Do tasks mark as automatic, or do metapackages?
2012-04-30T15:11:00.000Z	ogra_	Darael	tasks mark as automatic
2012-04-30T15:11:00.000Z	Darael	ogra_	Because I used tasksel (which uses aptitude, generally, IME), and I have things that I'd expect to be marked automatic flagged as manual.
2012-04-30T15:11:00.000Z	ogra_	Darael	no, tasksel and aptitude are two totally different things
2012-04-30T15:12:00.000Z	Darael	ogra_	Yes, and tasksel calls aptitude.  I know, because I had a whole episode on amd64 using tasksel because of the aptitude multiarch bug.
2012-04-30T15:12:00.000Z	ogra_	Darael	well, then you might face an aptitude issue
2012-04-30T15:15:00.000Z	Darael	ogra_	That's what I /thought/ was the case, but apt-cache depends tasksel shows "Depends: aptitude"
2012-04-30T15:16:00.000Z	ogra_	Darael	right, as i said above, might be a bug in aptitude
2012-04-30T15:21:00.000Z	ogra_	Darael	https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/livecd-rootfs/+bug/424643 (pretty pld bug, feel free to drop into #ubuntu-installer if you know a solution :) )
2012-04-30T15:28:00.000Z	ogra_	Darael	well, the "right" way to install a task is apt-get install taskname^ (note the caret) ... and i actually thought tasksel uses that in the backend since a while ... i might be wrong though
2012-04-30T15:28:00.000Z	Darael	ogra_	Maybe it does in Precise.  It certainly doesn't in Oneiric.
