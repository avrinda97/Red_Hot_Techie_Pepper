2010-07-07T02:57:00.000Z	Puffcio		hi, doesnt anyone can help me with my ubuntu question?! :D
2010-07-07T02:58:00.000Z	Puffcio		ive installed ubuntu via wubi on windows 7 on partition "D"
2010-07-07T02:58:00.000Z	Puffcio		i can see my windows partition
2010-07-07T02:59:00.000Z	Puffcio		but not the partition "D"
2010-07-07T02:59:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Puffcio	yeah Ubuntu won't boot?
2010-07-07T02:59:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Puffcio	its  in the file system of wubi and then /hosts I think  to access Windows partition read only
2010-07-07T03:00:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Puffcio	also in the long run much better to use a partitoned install, plus  by doing so you can easilly access the data using the Live CD, can't do that with Wubi
2010-07-07T03:00:00.000Z	Puffcio	sebsebseb	thank you
2010-07-07T03:01:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Puffcio	and setting up a seperate /home before installing is useful :)
2010-07-07T03:01:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Puffcio	right, but a proper partitioned install will run a bit better,  you may not notice it though
2010-07-07T03:02:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Puffcio	ok
2010-07-07T03:02:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Puffcio	still got your ISO by the way?
2010-07-07T03:02:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Puffcio	ok that sounds good, but do you have WIndows apps that you want to run inside Ubuntu?
2010-07-07T03:03:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Puffcio	is that it, no 3D Windows games or whatever, just want to use a web browser and play music?
2010-07-07T03:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Puffcio	ok right yeah you don't need Windows then
2010-07-07T03:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Puffcio	Really I shoudn't need to type this, because the Ubuntu website should be making it clear to people, but no, that before using an ISO it is a good idea to check it :)   So before you burn contents of the ISO  to a CD and install Ubuntu from it properly, after removing Wubi.
2010-07-07T03:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Puffcio	its a good tip.  and good practice
2010-07-07T03:07:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Puffcio	or right yeah, use that
