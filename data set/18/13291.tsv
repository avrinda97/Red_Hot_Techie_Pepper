2005-12-11T07:44:00.000Z	icerabbit		I have a quick question about Ubuntu.
2005-12-11T07:44:00.000Z	icerabbit		I've searched the forums to no avail, and request your help as a last resort. I have an ATI Radeon X800 Pro. For some reason, X wont work. I tried "dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg" then selecting the Vesa Driver, but that doesnt work either. Any suggestions please?
2005-12-11T07:44:00.000Z	tritium	icerabbit	you followed the wiki page for ati?
2005-12-11T07:47:00.000Z	tritium	icerabbit	then follow the wiki, and make sure you've installed the necessary packages
2005-12-11T07:48:00.000Z	tritium	icerabbit	you need both linux-restricted-modules-$(uname -r) and xorg-driver-fglrx
2005-12-11T07:49:00.000Z	tritium	icerabbit	which processor do you have?
2005-12-11T07:49:00.000Z	tritium	icerabbit	which one?
2005-12-11T07:52:00.000Z	tritium	icerabbit	apt-cache search linux-amd64, and look for an appropriate kernel meta-package (e.g. linux-amd64-generic, linux-amd64-k8)
2005-12-11T07:52:00.000Z	tritium	icerabbit	those will depend on and pull in a matching linux-restricted-modules when you install them
2005-12-11T07:53:00.000Z	tritium	icerabbit	or did you install a 32-bit version?
2005-12-11T08:18:00.000Z	tritium	icerabbit	yes.  sudo aptitude install xorg-driver-fglrx
2005-12-11T08:20:00.000Z	tritium	icerabbit	you got linux-amd64-generic or -k8 installed (along with linux-restricted-modules)?
2005-12-11T08:20:00.000Z	icerabbit	tritium	yes i installed it
2005-12-11T08:21:00.000Z	tritium	icerabbit	good deal
2005-12-11T08:47:00.000Z	tritium	icerabbit	what on earth are you doing?
2005-12-11T08:49:00.000Z	tritium	icerabbit	in that case, please bring me a beer, and do anything else I tell you ;)
2005-12-11T08:50:00.000Z	tritium	icerabbit	pour some lucky charms out on the table, and type what is spelled out on the console...
2005-12-11T09:32:00.000Z	tritium	icerabbit	isn't that on the wiki page?
