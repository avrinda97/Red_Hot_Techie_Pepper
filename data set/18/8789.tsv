2007-07-20T09:49:00.000Z	dissection		Anyone? Surely someone here edits their menus
2007-07-20T09:50:00.000Z	nickrud	dissection	it would edit your local menu, but write as root, maybe causing issues (I hate having root owned files in home)
2007-07-20T09:51:00.000Z	dissection	nickrud	So I should use sudo or not?
2007-07-20T09:51:00.000Z	nickrud	dissection	no
2007-07-20T09:51:00.000Z	nickrud	dissection	personally I just right click the menu bar, don't even call from the terminal
2007-07-20T09:52:00.000Z	dissection	nickrud	I did that but it doesn't run
2007-07-20T09:52:00.000Z	nickrud	dissection	ok
2007-07-20T09:53:00.000Z	dissection	nickrud	I checked .config/menus and its owned by reoot and settings.menu and applications.menu are read only. When I typed alacarte (without sudo) in terminal, I get an error. Does everyone else have menus directory as read only and owned by root?
2007-07-20T09:56:00.000Z	nickrud	dissection	no. they should not be. all mine are owned by me and 644 for permissions
2007-07-21T08:59:00.000Z	nickrud	dissection	/msg ubotu !firewall <-- for personal info
2007-07-22T09:18:00.000Z	nickrud	dissection	you can embed cover art, easytag is an easy way to do that
2007-07-22T09:18:00.000Z	dissection	nickrud	Oh cool :D
2007-07-22T09:20:00.000Z	dissection	nickrud	Any idea how is its saved? Is it part of the ID3, or saved separately somewhere as a hidden file?
2007-07-22T09:22:00.000Z	nickrud	dissection	everything I see uses embedded as the terminology, but ....
2007-07-22T09:43:00.000Z	dissection	nickrud	I just tried easytag and embedded an MP3 into the file. It showed up in amarok with no problem. If I send this file to someone else, he can see the picture too?
2007-07-22T09:43:00.000Z	nickrud	dissection	yes
2007-07-22T09:43:00.000Z	nickrud	dissection	as long as his client is capable of reading the image
2007-09-26T10:14:00.000Z	nickrud	dissection	location doesn't matter, and 2gb
