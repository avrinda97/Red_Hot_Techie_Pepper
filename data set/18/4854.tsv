2009-02-04T20:47:00.000Z	ikonia	rainmanp7	multi connections routing to the internet is not a good idea, why do you want two ?
2009-02-04T20:48:00.000Z	rainmanp7	ikonia	so I can test to see if the USB wireless is working or can work at all
2009-02-04T20:48:00.000Z	ikonia	rainmanp7	disconnect your cable to test it
2009-02-04T20:48:00.000Z	rainmanp7	ikonia	I need it to work on a differn't machine across the house so i can install ubuntu and plug it in and know it's going to work
2009-02-04T20:49:00.000Z	rainmanp7	ikonia	K will try that
2009-02-04T20:49:00.000Z	ikonia	rainmanp7	ok - so why do you need both connections active at the same time to test it ?
2009-02-04T20:50:00.000Z	ikonia	rainmanp7	as soon as you plug it in and it works your routing will be messed up and it will kill both connections
2009-02-04T20:50:00.000Z	ikonia	rainmanp7	hence why you need to test with one connection at a time
2009-02-04T20:50:00.000Z	rainmanp7	ikonia	ok so uplug the cable and boot up ?
2009-02-04T20:50:00.000Z	ikonia	rainmanp7	with the usb key in, yes
2009-02-04T20:51:00.000Z	rainmanp7	ikonia	ok here go's :)
