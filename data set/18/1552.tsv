2011-02-01T21:29:00.000Z	hilarie		Okay, so I am trying to add a start up program "Xchat" so I put Xchat in the name, and in the command I just put, Xchat? or could I put a pause -60 Xchat?
2011-02-01T21:30:00.000Z	jrib	hilarie	"xchat" lowercase, probably.  Check in your terminal.
2011-02-01T21:31:00.000Z	hilarie	jrib	program names are case sensitive?
2011-02-01T21:31:00.000Z	jrib	hilarie	all filenames are case-sensitive
2011-02-01T21:31:00.000Z	hilarie	jrib	wow
2011-02-01T21:32:00.000Z	hilarie	jrib	how do I force a pause or a wait or delay of some sort?
2011-02-01T21:33:00.000Z	jrib	hilarie	you can use "sleep N" where N is a the number of seconds, but you shouldn't need to
2011-02-01T21:33:00.000Z	hilarie	jrib	I am adding a bunch of internet crap to my startup, and I can't figure out how to autoconnect to my wifi, therefore a sleep of 30sec will give me time not to get a bunch of 404's
2011-02-01T21:34:00.000Z	jrib	hilarie	ok
2011-04-02T16:49:00.000Z	jrib	hilarie	read the list, make sure you don't actually want any, and proceed.  It means that you removed some package that required the packages in this long list, so they aren't needed anymore
2011-04-02T16:50:00.000Z	hilarie	jrib	it doesn't give me that option, it kicks me back to hilarie@hilarie:~$
2011-04-02T16:51:00.000Z	jrib	hilarie	sure, if that's what you want.
2011-04-02T16:53:00.000Z	hilarie	jrib	are those things important?
2011-04-02T16:54:00.000Z	jrib	hilarie	not particularly
2011-04-02T16:55:00.000Z	hilarie	jrib	I feel it might have been my misadventure into unity
2011-04-02T16:55:00.000Z	jrib	hilarie	probably
2011-04-02T16:55:00.000Z	jrib	hilarie	they wouldn't do that...
2011-04-02T16:56:00.000Z	jrib	hilarie	no problem
