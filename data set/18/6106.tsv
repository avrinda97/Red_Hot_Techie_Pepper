2008-06-29T16:14:00.000Z	raedwald		afternoon.....
2008-06-29T16:15:00.000Z	raedwald		just wondered, has anyone come across a problem with 8.04 where anCD/DVD drive on the 2nd IDE bus isn't recognised?
2008-06-29T16:17:00.000Z	raedwald		not mixing, no (although the MoBo is SATA capable all drives are IDE). It's fine with 7.10 but the final release of 8.04 gives problems.
2008-06-29T16:17:00.000Z	raedwald		says that hdc is "not ready for command", and the drive is locked
2008-06-29T16:18:00.000Z	raedwald		yes, and that's fine
2008-06-29T16:18:00.000Z	raedwald		dual-boot
2008-06-29T16:18:00.000Z	raedwald		not in dual boot it wouldn't.
2008-06-29T16:19:00.000Z	raedwald		If I boot from an 8.04 install cd if fails because it cant see the drive. Yet 7.10 is fine
2008-06-29T16:21:00.000Z	raedwald		so whatever the issue is it's something in 8.04
2008-06-29T16:21:00.000Z	Bodsda	raedwald	actually its probably got more to do with your hardware
2008-06-29T16:22:00.000Z	Bodsda	raedwald	it could be a bad download, a bad burn, cd drive might not be ble to read it, did you check the download with md5?
2008-06-29T16:23:00.000Z	Bodsda	raedwald	and you burned the iso at a slow speed?
2008-06-29T16:23:00.000Z	Bodsda	raedwald	so whats the prob?
2008-06-29T16:25:00.000Z	Bodsda	raedwald	there is no such distro 8.4 or 8.10
2008-06-29T16:31:00.000Z	raedwald	Bodsda	any ideas?
2008-06-29T16:31:00.000Z	Bodsda	raedwald	google?
2008-06-29T16:33:00.000Z	raedwald	Bodsda	the only box out of 6 that has this problem has an ALi M1689 chipset
2008-06-29T16:33:00.000Z	Bodsda	raedwald	ive already said i dont know how to fix your problem, please address the channel
