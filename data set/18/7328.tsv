2010-11-21T05:15:00.000Z	igor_		Hi everyone, I'm running Ubuntu 10.04 (because of WiFi problems with 10.10) and my "Hardware Drivers" tool reports that "no proprietary drivers are in use by this system" and the list is empty. How do I add drivers to it? Everywhere I've read about how to use proprietary drivers said that I should use that tool, find the driver I want and just press activate. Thanks!
2010-11-21T05:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	igor_	then run:  sudo lshw -C network   and websearch for the product line to find guides
2010-11-21T05:17:00.000Z	igor_	ActionParsnip	will try that in a sec
2010-11-21T05:19:00.000Z	igor_	ActionParsnip	actually i need nvidia drivers, I know how to install them but they still aren't listed in hardware drivers. and shouldnt it be as easy as pressing activate in hardware drivers?
2010-11-21T05:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	igor_	possibly, depends on the chip
2010-11-21T05:21:00.000Z	igor_	ActionParsnip	i expected at least something to be displayed under "hardware drivers" but the list is empty...it baffles me :\
2010-11-21T05:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	igor_	if you have a super whizzy nvidia chip then the 260 chip helps
2010-11-21T05:23:00.000Z	igor_	ActionParsnip	how do i install it if its not listed in hardware drivers? with synaptic?
2010-11-21T05:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	igor_	sure, but what video chip are you using?
2010-11-21T05:24:00.000Z	igor_	ActionParsnip	its an old integrated card
2010-11-21T05:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	igor_	ok what is the output of: lspci | grep -i vga
2010-11-21T05:27:00.000Z	igor_	ActionParsnip	wow I sure am an idiot. Its an intel card :P
2010-11-21T05:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	igor_	thats why then
2010-11-21T05:28:00.000Z	igor_	ActionParsnip	indeed that explains it. I somehow recalled installing nvidia drives when i installed windows...eh must have been on another PC. thanks for the assistance!

2012-03-10T10:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	igor_	try a different output method. x11 works well in most cases
2012-03-10T10:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	igor_	is it the same in all players?
2012-03-10T11:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	igor_	if you make a new user and login as that is it the same? Have you tried logging in to unity2d session
