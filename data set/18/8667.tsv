2008-04-18T05:55:00.000Z	Moridin333		auctionedllama if you're comfortable with command line backup you xorg.conf and try different drivers in System>Administration>Screens and Graphics
2008-04-18T05:55:00.000Z	zero__		ok Moridin333, that fixed my external monitor issue, now how to i get back to 1440x900 on m;y laptop?
2008-04-18T05:55:00.000Z	Moridin333	zero__	try Preferences>Screen Resolution
2008-04-18T05:56:00.000Z	zero__	Moridin333	1440x900 is not available, and its not showing my graphics card anymore,a nd i dont know what to select for that, i have an Nvidia Gforce FX 64 mb
2008-04-18T05:57:00.000Z	Moridin333	zero__	if you run the restricted driver manager in System>Administration it should give you the nvidia driver and open up that option.
2008-04-18T05:57:00.000Z	zero__		it says its in use Moridin333
2008-04-18T05:57:00.000Z	Moridin333		auctionedllama what version are you using?
