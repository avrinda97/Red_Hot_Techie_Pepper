2007-11-23T06:23:00.000Z	Sp3c1alK		So I installed ubuntu desktop to my hard drive partition, but now when I select ubuntu as my operating system to boot into, all I get is a black screen, I've waited 15 minutes for it to come up..but nothing..why?
2007-11-23T06:25:00.000Z	genii	Sp3c1alK	Try hitting enter key. Or it could be you have 2 video cards/dual-head and video goes to the other one. Does it boot to failsafe kernel?
2007-11-23T06:26:00.000Z	Sp3c1alK	genii	I am running 1 video card and 2 monitors, that could be a problem? Also, when I boot into recovery mode i get soemthing that says: desktop->kevin (or something like that)
2007-11-23T06:27:00.000Z	genii	Sp3c1alK	recovery mode indicates successful install. The x server seems to be issue. Any video on the second monitor?
2007-11-23T06:29:00.000Z	genii	Sp3c1alK	in recovery/failsafe edit the xorg.conf file and put as the name of the video driver "vesa" instead of "nv" or "ati" or whatever it has now
2007-11-23T06:29:00.000Z	Sp3c1alK	genii	i'm not sure how to do that, i'm  n00b to ubuntu
2007-11-23T06:30:00.000Z	genii	Sp3c1alK	eg:    nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf                     then find where it has a line like "nv" or "ati" or so. Replace with vesa as the name
2007-11-23T06:31:00.000Z	genii	Sp3c1alK	then exit with ctrl-x and choose yes to save the file. after do: telinit 2
2007-11-23T06:31:00.000Z	Sp3c1alK	genii	I will try that, and if that doesn't work I will try the sude dpkg command and then get back to you
2007-11-23T06:31:00.000Z	genii	Sp3c1alK	Ok I'll be arounf maybe another hour
2007-11-23T07:05:00.000Z	Sp3c1alK	genii	I tried the nano etc/x11/xorg.conf and it was an empty file, so I did the sudo dpkg=reconfigure  and configured everything, i set vesa as my video card driver, but when I boot normally my monitor looses signal, but if I choose the nva (nVidia i guess) it loads but still just a black screen

2007-11-23T07:08:00.000Z	genii	Sp3c1alK	Unfortunately I'm too wiped to assist much today. The key to it seems to be obviously in your x server setup someplace however
2007-11-23T07:08:00.000Z	Sp3c1alK	genii	any good forums or other irc channels to check upon?
2007-11-23T07:10:00.000Z	Sp3c1alK	genii	what are some good forums I could use to fix the probme?
2007-11-23T07:11:00.000Z	genii	Sp3c1alK	ubuntuforums is usually very useful
2007-11-23T07:11:00.000Z	Sp3c1alK	genii	thanks
