2005-10-10T07:39:00.000Z	windex	lonetree	you need to set up a secure vpn?
2005-10-10T07:40:00.000Z	windex	lonetree	well, keep in mind, pptp can have a 48 bit cipher associated with it, i think. is that not enough?
2005-10-10T07:41:00.000Z	windex	lonetree	sorry, 56 bit
2005-10-10T07:42:00.000Z	windex	lonetree	ok, so how is pptp unsuitable? the only reason pptp is good is because it dosen't require anything special for microsoft clients
2005-10-10T07:43:00.000Z	windex	lonetree	do you have forwarding between interfaces enabled?
2005-10-10T07:44:00.000Z	windex	lonetree	i mean, basically, you need to have routes established unless you are doing an ARP proxy to put VPN clients on the same subnet.
2005-10-10T07:45:00.000Z	windex	lonetree	is your VPN box your gateway for 192.168.123.x and 10.0.x.x ?
