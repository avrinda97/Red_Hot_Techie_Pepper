2007-12-10T15:24:00.000Z	Stevethepirate		Like, at university we have network points in our rooms. [only 1]. So I have 4 PC's.. so i'm gonna plug the server into one [the wall] then on the other network card on it, plug into a switch with the other PC's on it.
2007-12-10T15:25:00.000Z	Stevethepirate		One IP per port, MAC filtered.. :(
2007-12-10T15:25:00.000Z	Stevethepirate		And I have a switch already. [hence the method of connection to the other PC's]
2007-12-10T15:26:00.000Z	VSpike	Stevethepirate	you need to do NAT routng right?
2007-12-10T15:26:00.000Z	Stevethepirate	VSpike	perhaps.
2007-12-10T15:27:00.000Z	VSpike	Stevethepirate	yes, you do.  If you have a spare old PC, use smoothwall

2007-12-10T15:33:00.000Z	VSpike	Stevethepirate	you could try the ubuntu firewall program at http://rob.pectol.com/content/view/2/1/ and the howto i linked above
2007-12-10T15:33:00.000Z	Stevethepirate	VSpike	no.. not a firewall..
2007-12-10T15:33:00.000Z	VSpike	Stevethepirate	it has a setup for ICS and NAT routing
2007-12-10T15:34:00.000Z	VSpike	Stevethepirate	read the article
2007-12-10T15:34:00.000Z	VSpike	Stevethepirate	yes what you want is NAT routing, sometimes called ICS (Internet Connection Sharing)
2007-12-10T15:35:00.000Z	Stevethepirate	VSpike	if i wanted ICS, i would use tinyproxy.
2007-12-10T15:35:00.000Z	VSpike	Stevethepirate	the reason for all the mentions of firewalls is that the same kernel modules and software are used for both purposes
2007-12-10T15:35:00.000Z	Stevethepirate	VSpike	i've read that before.
2007-12-10T15:35:00.000Z	VSpike	Stevethepirate	proxy and NAT are not the same thing
2007-12-10T15:36:00.000Z	VSpike	Stevethepirate	I guess I missed an important part of the discussion then... so what are you trying to do?
2007-12-10T15:42:00.000Z	Stevethepirate	VSpike	router is not what is happening.
