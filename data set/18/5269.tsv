2010-02-22T08:03:00.000Z	ssmy	qiyong	Applications > Sound/video > Brasero
2010-02-22T08:04:00.000Z	ssmy	qiyong	that opens brasero. or, right-click the ISO and select write to disk.
2010-02-22T08:05:00.000Z	ssmy	qiyong	are you running ubuntu? or kubuntu?
2010-02-22T08:06:00.000Z	qiyong	ssmy	 the desktop is now lxde.  now i have k3b installed in the menu
2010-02-22T08:06:00.000Z	ssmy	qiyong	k3b should have an option to burn an iso somewhere
2010-02-22T08:06:00.000Z	qiyong	ssmy	is it = to use k3b?
2010-02-22T08:07:00.000Z	ssmy	qiyong	try Tools > write ISO image
2010-02-22T08:07:00.000Z	qiyong	ssmy	what file manager to use to right-click ?
2010-02-22T08:07:00.000Z	ssmy	qiyong	yeah, it's just a different program, same action.
2010-02-22T08:07:00.000Z	ssmy	qiyong	i know Nautlius (default in gnome) can
2010-02-22T08:08:00.000Z	qiyong	ssmy	, don't tell me tools > menu item, tell my the app name so i can launch in console
2010-02-22T08:08:00.000Z	ssmy	qiyong	i meant inside k3b
2010-02-22T08:09:00.000Z	ssmy	qiyong	you would probably be better off with someone who has used k3b.
2010-02-22T08:09:00.000Z	qiyong	ssmy	so there's two apps, brasero and k3b, they both use wodim underline?
2010-02-22T08:10:00.000Z	ssmy	qiyong	they are just different cd apps. i don't know much about anything except brasero.
