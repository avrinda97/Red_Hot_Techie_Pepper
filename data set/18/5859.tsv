2011-07-10T22:12:00.000Z	sintaxevo		ive got a net connection via eth0 and am trying to share it to an ad-hoc mode wlan0 device, i can ping back and forth on the AP i've made but my phone has no internet access.. what'd i miss?
2011-07-10T22:13:00.000Z	sintaxevo		iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING  -s 192.168.100.0/24 -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
2011-07-10T22:13:00.000Z	sintaxevo		did i get that right
2011-07-10T22:14:00.000Z	sintaxevo		turned on ip forwarding too
2011-07-10T22:14:00.000Z	carandraug	sintaxevo	they should both have the same DNS and you must configure another file. Gimme 2 minutes to find that
2011-07-10T22:16:00.000Z	carandraug	sintaxevo	so you did. activate ipv4 forwarding? And reloaded the sysctl file?
2011-07-10T22:16:00.000Z	carandraug	sintaxevo	to check the iptables rules, just run iptables -L
2011-07-10T22:19:00.000Z	carandraug	sintaxevo	I don't do it that way. I enable it on /etc/sysctl.conf and the run sysctl -p
2011-07-10T22:20:00.000Z	carandraug	sintaxevo	also, the /etc/resolv.conf should be the same in both systems
2011-07-10T22:21:00.000Z	carandraug	sintaxevo	try running sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE
2011-07-10T22:22:00.000Z	carandraug	sintaxevo	I've done it many times but the opposite from you. I'd get internet by wifi and had another system next to it that would be connected by cable to the PC that had the internet connection
2011-07-10T22:24:00.000Z	carandraug	sintaxevo	well, maybe you need some configuration on the side of the phone. I'll have no idea how to do it
2011-07-10T22:25:00.000Z	carandraug	sintaxevo	do you have another system with wifi card running ubuntu too that could work as positive control?
2011-07-10T22:28:00.000Z	carandraug	sintaxevo	that would be good for control. I can help you on that. Never tried with a phne. I like my phones stupid :p
2011-07-10T22:29:00.000Z	carandraug	sintaxevo	yeah. I usually do 192.168.0.1 255.255.255.0
2011-07-10T22:30:00.000Z	carandraug	sintaxevo	yes. That looks right to me
2011-07-10T22:31:00.000Z	carandraug	sintaxevo	nice.
2011-07-10T22:31:00.000Z	carandraug	sintaxevo	glad you sorted it out
