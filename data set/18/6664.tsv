2008-04-14T23:28:00.000Z	cdecarlo	|Lee|	have you tried ifconfig up
2008-04-14T23:29:00.000Z	|Lee|	cdecarlo	No, I'll brb (I hate it when it's accrossed the hall..

2008-04-14T23:30:00.000Z	cdecarlo	|Lee|	what does lspci give you lspci | grep Ethernet
2008-04-14T23:31:00.000Z	|Lee|	cdecarlo	It shows an ethernet thing
2008-04-14T23:33:00.000Z	|Lee|	cdecarlo	Should I ifconfig -a and sudo dhclient?
2008-04-14T23:34:00.000Z	cdecarlo	|Lee|	sounds like a plan

2008-04-14T23:47:00.000Z	|Lee|	cdecarlo	I sudo apt-get installing kde now, and it has ssh installed and running .. I can ssh into it from there, but not from workstation.
2008-04-14T23:49:00.000Z	cdecarlo	|Lee|	 you have an ssh server running on the server?
2008-04-14T23:49:00.000Z	|Lee|	cdecarlo	Nevermind, got it, had to ssh 192.168.1.105 instead of localhost, because I'm on .103 instead of .105
