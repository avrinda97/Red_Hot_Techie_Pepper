2008-03-30T20:33:00.000Z	FancyL		is a question about different editions of ubuntu on topic?
2008-03-30T20:34:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	FancyL	probably not, but whats your question
2008-03-30T20:35:00.000Z	FancyL	IndyGunFreak	thanks. I'm brand new to linux as a whole and would like to know the main difference between the different editions (kubuntu, xubuntu, and ubuntu). gobuntu said it in plain english on their front page, and I can assume what edubuntu is.
2008-03-30T20:36:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	FancyL	main difference, in all of them, is the GUI they use.
2008-03-30T20:36:00.000Z	FancyL	IndyGunFreak	is one version lighter than another? I'm looking to install on an old laptop.
2008-03-30T20:37:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	FancyL	they'lll al do pretty much the same thing, its how they look while doin it, Ubuntu uses Gnome, Kubuntu uses KDE, and Xubuntu uses Xfce.
2008-03-30T20:37:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	FancyL	whast the sysstem specs on it?
2008-03-30T20:37:00.000Z	FancyL	IndyGunFreak	not sure, but it's running win98
2008-03-30T20:37:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	FancyL	well, a good place to start, is to know how much ram it is.
2008-03-30T20:37:00.000Z	FancyL	IndyGunFreak	I think 128
2008-03-30T20:38:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	FancyL	ok, w/ 128mb, you'll probably want to use Xubuntu.
2008-03-30T20:38:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	FancyL	you might even consider a straight debian install...
2008-03-30T20:38:00.000Z	FancyL	IndyGunFreak	will xubuntu run smoothly? or is D.S.L. more up my alley?
2008-03-30T20:39:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	FancyL	i think Xubuntu will run fine.
2008-03-30T20:39:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	FancyL	its system requirements only call for 64mb if I recall.
2008-03-30T20:39:00.000Z	FancyL	IndyGunFreak	straight debian sounds a lot more complicated than a live cd
2008-03-30T20:40:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	FancyL	no, not at all.. i mean its a text based installer.. but w/ only 128mb of Ram, you may have to use a text based installer anyways, even w/ ubuntu
2008-03-30T20:41:00.000Z	FancyL	IndyGunFreak	I'll try xubuntu. Thanks for your quick help.
