2007-05-11T13:50:00.000Z	Lacrymology		hey, I have a question
2007-05-11T13:50:00.000Z	Lacrymology		I have my system installed in a smallish slowish HDD, and I have a 300GB sata, and I'd want program files and the sort to be installed there
2007-05-11T13:50:00.000Z	Lacrymology		where should I mount it?
2007-05-11T13:51:00.000Z	LjL	Lacrymology	"program files"? what do you mean precisely?
2007-05-11T13:51:00.000Z	LjL	Lacrymology	anything that's not your own documents or the very basic system files - is that what you mean?
2007-05-11T13:51:00.000Z	Lacrymology	LjL	exactly
2007-05-11T13:51:00.000Z	Lacrymology	LjL	whatever takes most space.... programs' core files and the such
2007-05-11T13:52:00.000Z	LjL	Lacrymology	then you want to mount it on /usr. but of course, you have to copy everything you currently have in /usr there (and make sure the permissions are right!)
2007-05-11T13:52:00.000Z	Lacrymology	LjL	/usr, got it. I also need to think about the partition schema and put some of it under /home as well
2007-05-11T13:52:00.000Z	LjL	Lacrymology	having /home as a separate partition is often a good idea.
2007-05-11T13:53:00.000Z	LjL	Lacrymology	keep in mind you should do this kind of things from recovery mode, to be on the safe side. use "cp -a" for copying
2007-05-11T13:53:00.000Z	LjL		!boot > guzu    (guzu, see the private message from Ubotu)
2007-05-11T13:53:00.000Z	Lacrymology	LjL	I know. I know. I'm kind of a (newbiish) gentoo user really but my roommate needs something that just works, thats why we moved to ubuntu.
2007-05-11T13:54:00.000Z	Lacrymology	LjL	but program installation seems to be distro-dependant
2007-05-11T13:54:00.000Z	LjL	Lacrymology	although honestly, a huge but slow external drive doesn't seem like the best of choices for a /usr partition, to me
2007-05-11T13:54:00.000Z	Lacrymology	LjL	its a 300G 1.5gbps SATA drive
2007-05-11T13:55:00.000Z	Lacrymology		the small slow drive is in /
2007-05-11T13:55:00.000Z	LjL	Lacrymology	ah sorry right, i misread your description
