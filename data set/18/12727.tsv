2006-03-16T06:43:00.000Z	MadPirateBippy		Ahoy. I'm a newb who managed to kill her machine switching to Ubuntu- can anyone help? Or should I go to another channel?
2006-03-16T06:43:00.000Z	MadPirateBippy		I have an aged G3, OneFish, that had OS9.1 on it that someone gave me to play with.
2006-03-16T06:44:00.000Z	MadPirateBippy		It took me about an hour to get it to play nice with the 5.10 disk, and I thought everything had gone well...
2006-03-16T06:45:00.000Z	MadPirateBippy		but whenever it gets past booting up, it starts being mean to the monitor, and now they aren't talking.
2006-03-16T06:45:00.000Z	MadPirateBippy		I can't figure out how to get my OSX laptop to talk to OneFish, either- so I have a box here that I can't see what the hell is going on.
2006-03-16T06:47:00.000Z	MadPirateBippy		The error I'm getting is an Out Of Frequency Range error on the monitor, then the monitor goes dead.
2006-03-16T06:48:00.000Z	MadPirateBippy		I've played around with SuSe and with Debian Unstable.
2006-03-16T06:48:00.000Z	MadPirateBippy		I don't suck a$$, but I'm not great.
2006-03-16T06:48:00.000Z	zenbum	MadPirateBippy	try a newer monitor if one is available
2006-03-16T06:51:00.000Z	zenbum	MadPirateBippy	Ctrl-Opt-F1 should switch you to a text screen
2006-03-16T06:53:00.000Z	MadPirateBippy	zenbum	I'm setting it up now to try that
2006-03-16T06:54:00.000Z	zenbum	MadPirateBippy	if you can't get a text screen then there's no hope  :)
2006-03-16T06:55:00.000Z	zenbum	MadPirateBippy	you need to fix /etc/X11/xorg.conf to get X working.... but since I nothing about your monitor I can't advise you much there
2006-03-16T07:00:00.000Z	zenbum	MadPirateBippy	does your keyboard have a numeric keypad with a + key?.... if so, press Ctrl-Opt-F7 to change back to X screen, then press Ctrl-Opt-+ repeatedly... it might eventually sync up
2006-03-16T07:04:00.000Z	zenbum	MadPirateBippy	too bad, that would have been an easy fix.... well, for the time being you can use Ctrl-Opt-F1 through -F6 to switch between different text consoles
2006-03-16T07:05:00.000Z	zenbum	MadPirateBippy	support for older macs is kind of spotty in the linux world
2006-03-16T07:08:00.000Z	zenbum	MadPirateBippy	you are now beyond my feeble nerd powers  :)
2006-03-16T07:28:00.000Z	zenbum	MadPirateBippy	girl pirates are still a novelty though  :)
