2007-06-10T06:30:00.000Z	guerrillawon		Is anyone here proficient in ESD and willing to take a few minutes to throw me a bone?
2007-06-10T06:31:00.000Z	n2diy	guerrillawon	ESD?
2007-06-10T06:32:00.000Z	guerrillawon	n2diy	: yes.
2007-06-10T06:33:00.000Z	n2diy	guerrillawon	The ESD I'm familiar with is Electro Static Discharge, is that what your referring to?
2007-06-10T06:33:00.000Z	guerrillawon	n2diy	: I think I am having a conflict. As I knock out all of my sound, when I use both mplayer and flash at the same time. Videos unaffected, but no sound.
2007-06-10T06:33:00.000Z	guerrillawon	n2diy	: I'm referring to Esound, a linux audio archetecture used to handle the playing of multiple sound sources through single devices simultaniously.
2007-06-10T06:34:00.000Z	guerrillawon	n2diy	: I wish I could just throw on an esd wrist strap and fix my problem, but I tried to no avail.
2007-06-10T06:34:00.000Z	n2diy	guerrillawon	Nope, can't help you with that, maybe your wrist strap is open? :)
2007-06-10T06:35:00.000Z	guerrillawon	n2diy	: Nope. :(
2007-06-10T06:35:00.000Z	n2diy	guerrillawon	GL
2007-06-10T06:56:00.000Z	guerrillawon	n2diy	: you here?
2007-06-10T06:56:00.000Z	n2diy	guerrillawon	yep
2007-06-10T06:57:00.000Z	guerrillawon	n2diy	: I cleaned my computer yesterday right, plugged everything in... except for my friggin esd wrist strap. You were right, it was just unplugged. (I still have sound problems, but not these anymore) haha
2007-06-10T06:57:00.000Z	guerrillawon	n2diy	: The help is very much appreciated.
2007-06-10T06:58:00.000Z	n2diy	guerrillawon	Ok, I was joking, but I'm glad you are making progress.
2007-06-10T06:58:00.000Z	guerrillawon	n2diy	:basically my speakers were not plugged in.
2007-06-10T06:58:00.000Z	n2diy	guerrillawon	Yea, that would cause trouble.
2007-06-10T07:00:00.000Z	n2diy	guerrillawon	Yep, when I use my HF I rig I turn of my speakers to keep the RF out of them, and then I forget to turn them back on! :/
