2011-06-04T14:17:00.000Z	ikonia	spidrnet	do you know why ?
2011-06-04T14:18:00.000Z	ikonia	spidrnet	you have no understanding of what his problem is, why it's occuring and you're asking him to carry out blind commands
2011-06-04T14:18:00.000Z	ikonia	spidrnet	a little resarch will tell you the problem and you can resolve it, but spewing out random links with no understanding of the problem isn't helpful

2011-06-04T14:21:00.000Z	ikonia	spidrnet	you have no understanding why he can't mount, is the file system mounted read only, is it mounted in userspace and he's the wrong user, is it a file system without permissions support, etc etc, throwing a random link isn't helpful
