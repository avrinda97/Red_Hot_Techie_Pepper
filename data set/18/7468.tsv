2008-01-06T23:08:00.000Z	miccet	ankur	did you run a check on the file system_
2008-01-06T23:08:00.000Z	ankur	miccet	yup i did, there was no errors ( I did fsck)
2008-01-06T23:09:00.000Z	miccet		and what is the fstab line for it?
2008-01-06T23:09:00.000Z	ankur	miccet	does error forces it to remount as read only?
2008-01-06T23:09:00.000Z	miccet		yea it can
2008-01-06T23:09:00.000Z	miccet	ankur	did you check dmesg for r/w errors?
2008-01-06T23:10:00.000Z	ankur	miccet	I did dmesg but I didn't understand if there were any error
2008-01-06T23:11:00.000Z	ankur	miccet	but when it mounts as read only for any command it gives I/o error
2008-01-06T23:11:00.000Z	miccet	ankur	it's usually pretty obvious of there is an error, usually says something with CRC error etc
2008-01-06T23:16:00.000Z	ankur	miccet	is there any way I can show you my dmesg report file
2008-01-06T23:17:00.000Z	miccet		you could do a dmesg > output.txt
2008-01-06T23:17:00.000Z	miccet	ankur	it will create a file with the output
2008-01-06T23:18:00.000Z	ankur	miccet	I already created the file
2008-01-06T23:18:00.000Z	miccet		pastebin is one
2008-01-06T23:18:00.000Z	miccet		yeh :)
2008-01-06T23:19:00.000Z	miccet		just realized i have  a lot of crap in the dmesg myself :)
2008-01-06T23:21:00.000Z	ankur	miccet	it is here http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/50992/
