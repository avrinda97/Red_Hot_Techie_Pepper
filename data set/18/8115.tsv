2007-12-14T21:28:00.000Z	Marfi		does gutsy come with a firewall? if so, where do i go to configure it?
2007-12-14T21:29:00.000Z	Marfi		i was just asking if one came installed. that answered my question though. =)
2007-12-14T21:31:00.000Z	bazhang	Marfi	just use transmission--no ports to open :}
2007-12-14T21:34:00.000Z	Marfi	bazhang	guess what? still not going. =) could it be a package on my end that would mess up all of the bittorrent traffic?
2007-12-14T21:35:00.000Z	bazhang	Marfi	just wait a bit, that kind of thing is hard to manage (kind of like herding cats)
2007-12-14T21:36:00.000Z	Marfi	bazhang	mmkay. ill be patient
2007-12-14T21:39:00.000Z	Marfi	bazhang	the file im downloading has ~ 29,000 seeds. it has timed out 3 times...any ideas?
2007-12-14T21:40:00.000Z	bazhang	Marfi	assuming this an ubuntu iso (heh), then it would be an issue with the seeders,and likely not your computer--you can also try utorrent with wine, or ktorrent
2007-12-14T21:41:00.000Z	Marfi	bazhang	naruto. ;)
2007-12-14T21:41:00.000Z	bazhang	Marfi	meaning ubuntu, obviously may need to read up on port forwarding and dht (teh google is yer friend) :}
2007-12-14T22:09:00.000Z	bazhang	Marfi	yay

2008-01-06T08:47:00.000Z	bazhang	Marfi	tritium has the best advice
2008-01-06T08:49:00.000Z	bazhang	Marfi	outside of getting a linux magazine of downloading the various distros individually, then likely not
2008-07-05T07:42:00.000Z	bazhang	Marfi	yes
