2008-11-02T02:00:00.000Z	TechN9ne1730		for some reason my Broadcom 802.11g Network Adapter was working great, and now it suddenly wont allow me to network wirlesly, only wired, any ideas? I believe it is tied to an auto update
2008-11-02T02:01:00.000Z	mallochigh	TechN9ne1730	Check your drives on shell with lsmod, check ps -ax for a wireless daemon.. check apt for wireless package..
2008-11-02T02:02:00.000Z	TechN9ne1730	mallochigh	how do i do that?
2008-11-02T02:03:00.000Z	mallochigh	TechN9ne1730	open up a terminal, ssh root@localhost passwd, or use sudo, su to perform root command. or hit ctrl-alt-f1 that give you a login shell, and then put in root/pw
2008-11-02T02:05:00.000Z	TechN9ne1730	mallochigh	now what?
2008-11-02T02:07:00.000Z	mallochigh	TechN9ne1730	 if you don't even know how to get to a shell, I can't help you. You may be able to use the administrator tab to fix it, you may also want to look at your synaptics for a wireless package and reinstall it.
2008-11-02T02:08:00.000Z	TechN9ne1730	mallochigh	you just helped me get into shell and i am now in shell
2008-11-02T02:09:00.000Z	TechN9ne1730	mallochigh	"no wirless extensions" is what it says
2008-11-02T02:09:00.000Z	TechN9ne1730	mallochigh	the hardware drivers are installed though
2008-11-02T02:10:00.000Z	TechN9ne1730	mallochigh	broadcom
2008-11-02T02:10:00.000Z	TechN9ne1730	mallochigh	broadcom 4401 to be exact
2008-11-02T02:11:00.000Z	TechN9ne1730	mallochigh	it was working fine before the auto update yesterday and is recgonized in ubuntu
2008-11-02T02:14:00.000Z	TechN9ne1730	mallochigh	is there a way to roll back the drivers?
2008-11-02T02:15:00.000Z	mallochigh	TechN9ne1730	 No. ? Maybe in grub you have an old kernel listed. This is very fixable, but really I don't have the support skills to help you quickly.
2008-11-02T02:16:00.000Z	TechN9ne1730	mallochigh	, i been searching for hours
