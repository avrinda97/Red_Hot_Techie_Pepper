2007-11-18T17:31:00.000Z	Deon		Hi, I'm having some trouble with my live cd of ubuntu 7.04 that I ordered :(
2007-11-18T17:32:00.000Z	Deon		And it said to ask here ^^
2007-11-18T17:32:00.000Z	mavi-	Deon	ask ahead =)
2007-11-18T17:32:00.000Z	mavi-	Deon	cant boot from it?
2007-11-18T17:33:00.000Z	Deon	mavi-	I'm not sure, sorry. How do I find out?
2007-11-18T17:34:00.000Z	mavi-	Deon	hard to say, do you have access so you can download the image and burn another copy?
2007-11-18T17:34:00.000Z	Deon	mavi-	I don't think it's the CD, I'd say it's my poor computer. What are the specs for Ubuntu 7.04?
2007-11-18T17:35:00.000Z	mavi-	Deon	it should run on some really old stuff
2007-11-18T17:35:00.000Z	mavi-	Deon	hm, do you have a OS installed on the computer now?
2007-11-18T17:36:00.000Z	Deon	mavi-	Windows XP on partiton one (hda1), Damn Small Linux on part2 (hda2)
2007-11-18T17:36:00.000Z	mavi-	Deon	if so, maybe boot that one up and note down the hardware and search for known problems
2007-11-18T17:36:00.000Z	mavi-	Deon	when the gui is supposed to come up, do the screen go blank or do the computer hangs?
2007-11-18T17:37:00.000Z	mavi-	Deon	that should be enough sure
2007-11-18T17:37:00.000Z	Deon	mavi-	It just keeps loading and loading like the RAM or CPU usage is absolutely hammered.
2007-11-18T17:37:00.000Z	Deon	mavi-	So what do you thinks the problem? :(
2007-11-18T17:38:00.000Z	mavi-	Deon	no idea, but probably some graphics-setting that isnt working with your hardware, as it works if you start it without gfx
2007-11-18T17:44:00.000Z	Deon	mavi-	So is there any workaround or anything I can use, like a reduced graphics mode or something not so intensive if my Graphics card cant handle it?
2007-11-18T17:44:00.000Z	mavi-	Deon	no idea =( try noacpi
