2011-03-14T00:06:00.000Z	raven		evolution comes up with first-start-config again - how to rescue?
2011-03-14T00:06:00.000Z	broyles	raven	what problems have you had before it came up
2011-03-14T00:07:00.000Z	raven	broyles	no problems
2011-03-14T00:08:00.000Z	broyles	raven	has evolution been working ok for a while? (have you done any updates etc?)
2011-03-14T00:09:00.000Z	raven	broyles	worked fine, no manual updates
2011-03-14T00:10:00.000Z	broyles	raven	mm one thing to try is closing the wizard and trying to launch from a terminal window, see if there is any errors
2011-03-14T00:11:00.000Z	raven	broyles	no error messages
2011-03-14T00:11:00.000Z	broyles	raven	does it launch the wizard again?
2011-03-14T00:11:00.000Z	raven	broyles	yes
2011-03-14T00:12:00.000Z	broyles	raven	thats strange.. does running "ls ~.evolution/mail/local/Inbox.sbd/" from a terminal work?
2011-03-14T00:13:00.000Z	raven	broyles	file not found
2011-03-14T00:14:00.000Z	raven	broyles	no results
2011-03-14T00:15:00.000Z	broyles	raven	sounds like your evolution dir has gone for some reason.... has anything else on your system gone back to defaults by any chance? does ls ~/.evolution work?
2011-03-14T00:17:00.000Z	raven	broyles	.evolution is there
2011-03-14T00:17:00.000Z	broyles	raven	does it contain anything?
2011-03-14T00:18:00.000Z	raven	broyles	yes several things
2011-03-14T00:18:00.000Z	broyles	raven	thats good, ;)
2011-03-14T00:19:00.000Z	broyles	raven	only thing I can suggest (unless any one has any ideas) is to follow the wizard putting in the same settings as you did before.. it may pick up your existing mail from those dirs
