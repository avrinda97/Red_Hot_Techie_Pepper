2011-08-05T19:13:00.000Z	atannus		Is it possible to Downgrade back to 10.10 from 11.04?
2011-08-05T19:13:00.000Z	atannus		Or do I need a clean install?
2011-08-05T19:15:00.000Z	atannus		*sigh*
2011-08-05T19:15:00.000Z	atannus		Then get the fucking upgrades working...
2011-08-05T19:16:00.000Z	atannus		neither is 11.04
2011-08-05T19:16:00.000Z	atannus		but no one seems to give a damn about that.
2011-08-05T19:16:00.000Z	usr13	atannus	I understand there is a way to do it and have seen some info on it, but don't know how reliable it is.  Best to back up your /home dir and do fresh install. (If you have /home on separate partition, just tell the install to leave it alone and set same user name.
2011-08-05T19:17:00.000Z	atannus	usr13	lucky I do... thanks.
2011-08-05T19:19:00.000Z	usr13	atannus	You can switch back to gnome....
2011-08-05T19:19:00.000Z	atannus	usr13	i cant BOOT into the system...
2011-08-05T19:19:00.000Z	atannus	usr13	the damn think is broken. upgrade broke it.
2011-08-05T19:20:00.000Z	atannus	usr13	I can ssh, but that's no good for a desktop...
2011-08-05T19:20:00.000Z	usr13	atannus	 What is broken?  (Probably can be fixed.)
2011-08-05T19:20:00.000Z	atannus	usr13	Ubuntu is. Unity.
2011-08-05T19:20:00.000Z	atannus	usr13	I get a purple screen, nothing else.
2011-08-05T19:20:00.000Z	atannus	usr13	its windows all over.
2011-08-05T19:21:00.000Z	usr13	atannus	...or gnome,(your choice).
2011-08-05T19:21:00.000Z	atannus	usr13	so much for error messages... just lock the user on a purple screen.
