2005-04-26T16:10:00.000Z	lunitik	ups	ooo, never seen screem before... it should get more publicity  :(
2005-04-26T16:13:00.000Z	lunitik	ups	heh
2005-04-26T16:20:00.000Z	ups	lunitik	debfoster seems nice
2005-04-26T16:21:00.000Z	lunitik	ups	simple... can edit what it knows about what you want installed via /var/lib/debfoster/keeps
2005-04-26T16:22:00.000Z	ups	lunitik	k, thx... i've used deborphan, this seems to be able to do more
2005-04-26T16:25:00.000Z	lunitik	ups	yeah... deborphan just tells you about libraries that aren't in use... debfoster informs you about packages not dependent on anything else, and allows you to do something about it...
2005-04-26T16:25:00.000Z	ups	lunitik	yeah
2005-04-26T16:39:00.000Z	lunitik	ups	my current install is a fresh hoary... with latest breezy stuff...
2005-04-26T16:40:00.000Z	ups	lunitik	i'm not touching my source file for atleast 3-4 weeks :)
2005-04-26T16:41:00.000Z	lunitik	ups	it is actually far afterwards that you encounter issues... next gnome isn't in etc... new oo.o is, but I haven't played enough to see if that has issues...
2005-04-26T16:42:00.000Z	lunitik	ups	removes xpdf and gnome-gs though, and installs evince, so I'm a happy camper  :)
2005-04-26T16:42:00.000Z	ups	lunitik	i've been running oo.o2 and evince for months now ;)
2005-04-26T16:43:00.000Z	lunitik	ups	I don't like to play with ubuntu-desktop much (because then its harder to figure out if I fucked something up with bug reports) ... having 2 copies of OO.o installed annoyed me
2005-04-26T16:45:00.000Z	ups	lunitik	well, i installed ubuntu-desktop back just before upgrading to hoary final, so right now i do have oo & oo2, still i can live with it for a while
2005-04-26T05:00:00.000Z	ups	lunitik	the packages that are being used will be built with gcc4
2005-04-26T05:02:00.000Z	lunitik	ups	I know that  :/
2005-04-26T05:16:00.000Z	ups	lunitik	with a sudo :p
2005-04-26T05:17:00.000Z	lunitik	ups	not if you already did a sudo -i  8)
