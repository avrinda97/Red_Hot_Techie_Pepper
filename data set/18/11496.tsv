2006-07-23T13:59:00.000Z	khoda		I just tried to install Ubuntu for the first time. It hangs right before it gets to the desktop with a really choppy looking Ubuntu logo. Any ideas?
2006-07-23T14:00:00.000Z	khoda		I just tried to install Ubuntu for the first time. It hangs right before it gets to the desktop with a really choppy looking Ubuntu logo in the middle of a maroon background. Is this a gfx problem? if so, what should I do?
2006-07-23T14:01:00.000Z	bruenig	khoda	try the alternate .iso
2006-07-23T14:01:00.000Z	khoda	bruenig	thats what I did. first i tried desktop CD, had the same problem.
2006-07-23T14:01:00.000Z	bruenig	khoda	you can also use the server .iso and just do "sudo aptitude install ubuntu-desktop"
2006-07-23T14:02:00.000Z	khoda	bruenig	I did that too. Same problem. (instead i used apt-get install ubuntu-desktop, is that the same?)
2006-07-23T14:02:00.000Z	bruenig	khoda	yeah
2006-07-23T14:02:00.000Z	khoda	bruenig	any ideas?
2006-07-23T14:02:00.000Z	bruenig	khoda	do sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2006-07-23T14:03:00.000Z	khoda	bruenig	how do i get to console to do that?
2006-07-23T14:05:00.000Z	bruenig	khoda	the wiki says ctrl + alt + F1 will give you a console

2006-07-23T14:06:00.000Z	khoda	bruenig	i did that when i did the server install, didn't work. should i try again?
2006-07-23T14:07:00.000Z	bruenig	khoda	yes
2006-07-23T14:09:00.000Z	khoda	bruenig	i just went through the reconfig. i got to a certain point and it kicked me out sayin "xserver-xorg postinst warning: overwwriting possible-customised config file; backup in /etc/x11/blahblah"
