2007-10-19T03:59:00.000Z	murkyMurk	sco50000	it's usually hardware compatibility...sometime terminal but usually sorted with a boot parametr such as noapci
2007-10-19T04:00:00.000Z	sco50000	murkyMurk	what should i do then?
2007-10-19T04:01:00.000Z	murkyMurk	sco50000	it's usually a question of trying several routes...best 1st step is goolging for ubuntu + your hardware...usually you aren't the first to crash & burn
2007-10-19T04:01:00.000Z	sco50000		gutsy is the newest version of ubuntu: 7.10
2007-10-19T04:01:00.000Z	sco50000	murkyMurk	ok, i'll try that
2007-10-19T04:01:00.000Z	murkyMurk	sco50000	yes, but new doesn't always mean backwards comaptible
2007-10-19T04:02:00.000Z	sco50000	murkyMurk	i was just answering someone's question: "what is gusty?"
