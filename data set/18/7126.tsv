2008-02-04T19:06:00.000Z	jack_spratt		anyone here had trouble with the intel video chipset and new xorg intel driver???
2008-02-04T19:06:00.000Z	PriceChild	jack_spratt	gutsy?
2008-02-04T19:07:00.000Z	jack_spratt	PriceChild	no, pclos, but im asking here because afaik its a cross distro problem. what do you know? i cant get video on my inspiron 1100 working on any newish livecd
2008-02-04T19:07:00.000Z	PriceChild	jack_spratt	its very much a per distro problem. We can't help here.
2008-02-04T19:07:00.000Z	jack_spratt	PriceChild	so does it work ok with gutsy?
2008-02-04T19:08:00.000Z	PriceChild	jack_spratt	of course
2008-02-04T19:08:00.000Z	jack_spratt	PriceChild	lol
2008-02-04T19:08:00.000Z	jack_spratt	PriceChild	well im skeptical but ill give it a go
2008-02-04T19:08:00.000Z	jack_spratt	PriceChild	thanks
2008-02-04T19:08:00.000Z	PriceChild	jack_spratt	you can use the ubuntu desktop cd as a live session to test it, without changing your harddrive
2008-02-04T19:09:00.000Z	jack_spratt	PriceChild	ok sure, we are talking about the xorg driver one and not the official intel one right?
2008-02-04T19:09:00.000Z	jack_spratt	PriceChild	because ive never seen that working, with pclos or mandriva or fedora or elive
2008-02-04T19:09:00.000Z	PriceChild	jack_spratt	they both work for me
2008-02-04T19:10:00.000Z	jack_spratt	PriceChild	what machine are you using them with out of interest - did you used to use the bios hack for video mem before this driver came out?
2008-02-04T19:10:00.000Z	PriceChild	jack_spratt	no, it has "just worked"
2008-02-04T19:11:00.000Z	jack_spratt	PriceChild	hmm, on what machine?
2008-02-04T19:11:00.000Z	PriceChild	jack_spratt	its a 945 chipset
2008-02-04T19:15:00.000Z	jack_spratt	PriceChild	ok thanks ill certainly give it a go, and if it works, you just won a pclos to ubuntu machine convert ;)
