2010-02-02T09:58:00.000Z	_nik_	Fauntix	use unet bootin
2010-02-02T09:58:00.000Z	Fauntix	_nik_	yes but where is it... its late, im tired, brain is fried >.<
2010-02-02T09:59:00.000Z	_nik_		fauntix: http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/
2010-02-02T10:00:00.000Z	Fauntix	_nik_	ty
2010-02-02T10:01:00.000Z	Fauntix	_nik_	oh should i get the live or net 64 version?
2010-02-02T10:01:00.000Z	Fauntix		@_niki_: or does the Live cover 64-bit
2010-02-02T10:02:00.000Z	_nik_		fauntix: the live-cd should be 32bit
2010-02-02T10:03:00.000Z	_nik_		fauntix: otherwise you can download the image manually and choose it in the menu
2010-02-02T10:04:00.000Z	Fauntix	_nik_	so if i need the 64-bit i should use the 9.1 netinstall 64?
2010-02-02T10:06:00.000Z	_nik_		fauntix: with netinstall, the packages would be downloaded at the installation
2010-02-02T10:08:00.000Z	Fauntix	_nik_	so for getting the 64-bit 9.1 would it easier to use the LiveUSB or download direct from the site?
2010-02-02T10:10:00.000Z	_nik_		fauntix: it depands on, what you prefer. the netinstall is a small image and downloads the aktual packages everytime you install ubuntu.
2010-02-02T10:11:00.000Z	Fauntix	_nik_	which way is the fastest if say at the time of install i dont have internet
2010-02-02T10:11:00.000Z	_nik_		fauntix: on the other image the packages are included, but you have to download it manually
2010-02-02T10:12:00.000Z	_nik_		fauntix: if you don't have internet you can't use the netinstallation
2010-02-02T10:13:00.000Z	Fauntix	_nik_	ok i understand now... last question... i have the old 8.04 (free 8.1 upgrade) disk that came with my 2008 ubuntu bible... can i install that and then upgrade to 9.1 or do i want a new disk with 9.1
