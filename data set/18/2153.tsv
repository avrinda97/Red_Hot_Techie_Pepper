2011-01-27T02:42:00.000Z	dannyD		I am having a recurrent problem with my window buttons disappearing globally. No minimize, no close buttons etc. Any Ideas on why this would be? Doesn't always happen. Kinda sporadic.
2011-01-27T02:42:00.000Z	el_seano	dannyD	Have you looked at the window buttons' values in gconf-editor?
2011-01-27T02:43:00.000Z	el_seano	dannyD	They're under apps->metacity->general
2011-01-27T02:43:00.000Z	dannyD	el_seano	ah you beat me to the followup question
2011-01-27T02:45:00.000Z	dannyD	el_seano	hmm don't know whats right and/or wrong on this gconf settings
2011-01-27T02:46:00.000Z	el_seano	dannyD	What's the value for 'button layout'?
2011-01-27T02:47:00.000Z	dannyD	el_seano	menu:minimize, maximize,close
2011-01-27T02:47:00.000Z	el_seano	dannyD	take out the space
2011-01-27T02:47:00.000Z	dannyD	el_seano	that was me, no space in value
2011-01-27T02:51:00.000Z	el_seano	dannyD	do the buttons show up with other themes?
2011-01-27T02:52:00.000Z	dannyD	el_seano	no :( . First thing I tried
2011-01-27T02:55:00.000Z	dannyD	el_seano	bronteee: ok so it works on another user...but the top action bar of Ubuntu is still slightly messed up.
2011-01-27T02:56:00.000Z	dannyD	el_seano	no nvidia driver
2011-01-27T02:58:00.000Z	dannyD	el_seano	how would I go about doing that?
2011-01-27T03:02:00.000Z	el_seano	dannyD	hm... if you remember the package names for the themes you downloaded, you could try apt-get --reinstall
2011-01-27T03:02:00.000Z	dannyD	el_seano	no I don't want the themes anymore. It was just an experiment anyway
2011-01-27T03:04:00.000Z	dannyD	el_seano	don't remember the names. it was a whole load of stuff I did to give my desktop the appearance of a Mac. But I decided I hate macs so went back to good ol Ubuntu
2011-01-27T03:06:00.000Z	el_seano	dannyD	Good luck! :D
