2008-06-06T09:00:00.000Z	drash	matthias_N	valgrind for instance
2008-06-06T09:01:00.000Z	matthias_N	drash	 easy to use and find problems ???
2008-06-06T09:01:00.000Z	matthias_N	drash	 or needed to digg into logg files ???
2008-06-06T09:02:00.000Z	drash	matthias_N	quite so yes, all depends on the complexity of what your debugging i'd say
2008-06-06T09:04:00.000Z	drash	matthias_N	it does it's best to keep digging around manually to a bare minimum yes .. what did you use before ?
2008-06-06T09:06:00.000Z	matthias_N	drash	 i have never used any program alike but now some program is drying out the memory i have pretty quick and i have a pretty good idea about where it is but not sure ...
2008-06-06T09:06:00.000Z	matthias_N	drash	 like to get my idea confirmed in some way ...
2008-06-06T09:06:00.000Z	drash	matthias_N	check valgrind.org, there's a small FAQ and info on quicly setting up your environment
2008-06-06T09:07:00.000Z	matthias_N	drash	 thank you i will and start using it today i hope ...
2008-06-06T09:08:00.000Z	drash	matthias_N	well yes, hopefully valgrind (which uses Memcheck behind the screens) can confirm
2008-06-06T09:09:00.000Z	matthias_N	drash	 thanks i will have an look  one more question , do you fight with wireless ???
2008-06-06T09:09:00.000Z	drash	matthias_N	believe it or not but i am a firm believer in hardwiring my internet connection, i've disabled wifi in ubuntu
