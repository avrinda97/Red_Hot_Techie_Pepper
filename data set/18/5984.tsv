2008-08-06T10:39:00.000Z	kdb424	alraune	: What's the next step? The machine is still running, and I ran your command.
2008-08-06T10:40:00.000Z	kdb424	alraune	: What do you mean the machine is currently down?
2008-08-06T10:43:00.000Z	kdb424	alraune	: Ok. Thanks. Is there a way to reinstall and only replace system files so as to keep all of my data, but get all of the system stuff back?
2008-08-06T10:47:00.000Z	kdb424	alraune	: I like that idea better than joejoecircusboy's, but thanks so much joejoe

2008-08-06T10:50:00.000Z	kdb424	alraune	: It is a server, but I have space to back up on this computer, which I am currently ssh connected to
2008-08-06T10:51:00.000Z	kdb424	alraune	: Pretty dang important. It's 14 GB or so
2008-08-06T10:53:00.000Z	kdb424	alraune	: Yea it does, but I'm REALY low on DVD's. That's why I am trying to ssh this to my computer or some other network connection.

2008-08-06T10:56:00.000Z	kdb424	alraune	: What do you mean? Could you please just tell me how to get the data from here? I am really deserate.
2008-08-06T10:58:00.000Z	kdb424	alraune	: It's in the server, and the only one in the server
2008-08-06T10:58:00.000Z	kdb424	alraune	: One problem with that
2008-08-06T10:58:00.000Z	kdb424	alraune	: That's where ubuntu is installed, and the only hard drive
2008-08-06T10:59:00.000Z	kdb424	alraune	: Lappi?
2008-08-06T11:01:00.000Z	kdb424	alraune	:I'm on my laptop now. My server is in the other room. I screwed the permissions on the ubuntu server install on the one hard drive in that server. How do I get those files on this mac laptop from a remote location (stlll on the same router though)
2008-08-06T11:04:00.000Z	kdb424	alraune	: I appreciate the help. I'm going to just say screw everyone that payed for storage and tell them to go screw themselves. I'm out of here.
