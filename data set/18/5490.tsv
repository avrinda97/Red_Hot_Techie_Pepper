2008-10-16T03:22:00.000Z	misteralexander	wall-e	 going into your network utility (System > Admin > Network Tools) and choose the tab "Ping"
2008-10-16T03:23:00.000Z	wall-e		ok and then what misteralexander?
2008-10-16T03:23:00.000Z	misteralexander	wall-e	 using your wired connection, type in -- 192.168.0.1
2008-10-16T03:23:00.000Z	misteralexander		and hit "Ping".
2008-10-16T03:24:00.000Z	misteralexander	wall-e	 What happens?  It shouldn't take THAT long.
2008-10-16T03:25:00.000Z	wall-e		nothing happened
2008-10-16T03:25:00.000Z	wall-e		it sent
2008-10-16T03:25:00.000Z	wall-e		but nothing received
2008-10-16T03:25:00.000Z	wall-e		it says packet transmitted
2008-10-16T03:25:00.000Z	misteralexander	wall-e	 Okay, it couldn't ping the gateway, which usually means your router isn't configured correctly.  Your signal isn't getting to the internet, because your computer can't even talk to your router.
