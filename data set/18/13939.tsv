2005-10-03T07:38:00.000Z	DarkOrigin		When I'm doing 'fakeroot make-jpkg jdk-1_5_0_05-linux-i586.bin' (official file downloaded from java.sun.com) in order to create a .deb package for it it loads some plugins, but then tells me that none of those match what I'm trying to do.. Can someone tell me how I can install java SDK 1.5 then?
2005-10-03T07:38:00.000Z	DarkOrigin		Should I just copy it somewhere and change the PATH variable ?
2005-10-03T07:39:00.000Z	DarkOrigin		ye
2005-10-03T07:39:00.000Z	DarkOrigin		thanks kemik, I'll test the link.
2005-10-03T07:39:00.000Z	DarkOrigin		pm? From the bot, or from you? Because I can only see one from the bot..
2005-10-03T07:40:00.000Z	DarkOrigin		'fakeroot make-jpkg jdk-1_5_0_05-linux-i586.bin' <-- that was what I did
2005-10-03T07:40:00.000Z	DarkOrigin		after setting it a+x of course.
2005-10-03T07:41:00.000Z	chrissturm	DarkOrigin	you dont need to set it +x if you use make-jpkg
2005-10-03T07:41:00.000Z	chrissturm	DarkOrigin	your java-package deb is too old. using hoary?
2005-10-03T07:42:00.000Z	chrissturm	DarkOrigin	i tried that 2 days ago and it worked
2005-10-03T07:43:00.000Z	DarkOrigin	chrissturm	yea, that's what I did as well (in the same dir as the .bin tho), but it tells me it needs a plugin.
2005-10-03T07:46:00.000Z	DarkOrigin	chrissturm	are you sure you did it with the JDK of 1.5 ?
2005-10-03T07:46:00.000Z	chrissturm	DarkOrigin	i can send you the deb i created

2005-10-03T07:49:00.000Z	chrissturm	DarkOrigin	what version of java-package do you have?
