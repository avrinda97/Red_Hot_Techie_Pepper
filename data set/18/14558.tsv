2005-07-13T10:09:00.000Z	Razor-X		my keyboard is too plain, my trackball is just awesome ;)
2005-07-13T10:10:00.000Z	Razor-X		my only grip is that, if the Ctrl key is weighted too much (which I've read it weighs more than the normal keys) my emacs'ing will suffer
2005-07-13T10:11:00.000Z	Razor-X		you darest insultest ye?
2005-07-13T10:11:00.000Z	Razor-X		I use Dvorak, so vi is a pain in the arse for me
2005-07-13T10:11:00.000Z	Razor-X		good to se another vim starter ;)
2005-07-13T10:11:00.000Z	Razor-X		compared to all these nano whelps
2005-07-13T10:12:00.000Z	Razor-X		because, that's my home row
2005-07-13T10:12:00.000Z	Razor-X		ewww, wasd ;)
2005-07-13T10:12:00.000Z	Razor-X		I've never used WASD, even in my QWERTY days
2005-07-13T10:13:00.000Z	Razor-X		dunno why WASD caught on, i've been an arrow key user through and through in UT
2005-07-13T10:13:00.000Z	jewel_	Razor-X	I think you can remap all of your keys in vim to the corresponding devorak keys
2005-07-13T10:13:00.000Z	Razor-X	jewel_	I probably can, regardless, I've fallen in love with emacs
2005-07-13T11:20:00.000Z	Razor-X	jewel_	did you see my all caps message?

2005-07-13T11:46:00.000Z	Razor-X	jewel_	hmmm, is it?
2005-07-13T11:47:00.000Z	Razor-X	jewel_	KDE does not use esd
2005-07-13T11:47:00.000Z	jewel_	Razor-X	Yeah, I know, that's why I tell him to kill it.  :)
