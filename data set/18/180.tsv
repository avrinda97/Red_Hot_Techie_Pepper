2012-11-18T21:11:00.000Z	ert3go	dr_willis	Ubuntu 12.04.1
2012-11-18T21:12:00.000Z	dr_willis	ert3go	 you havent ran nautilus as root have you in the past?
2012-11-18T21:12:00.000Z	dr_willis		you could check who owns the files ~/.config/gtk-3.0/bookmarks
2012-11-18T21:12:00.000Z	dr_willis		since thats where they seem to be saved here. but i am on 12.10
2012-11-18T21:13:00.000Z	ert3go	dr_willis	run nautilus in root as in ? I doubt I've done that
2012-11-18T21:13:00.000Z	dr_willis		rw-rw-r-- 1 willis willis 197 Nov 18 11:09 bookmarks
2012-11-18T21:13:00.000Z	dr_willis		check thta file. make sure its owned by your user. and not 'root root'
2012-11-18T21:16:00.000Z	ert3go	dr_willis	 /home/username/.config/gtk-3.0/bookmarks: No such file or directory
2012-11-18T21:17:00.000Z	dr_willis	ert3go	 that is odd..  perhaps its in the gtk3 dir
2012-11-18T21:17:00.000Z	dr_willis		or perhaps the directory is somehow owned by root so you cant write to it
2012-11-18T21:18:00.000Z	ert3go	dr_willis	 is it same as .gtk-bookmarks ?
2012-11-18T21:20:00.000Z	dr_willis	ert3go	 look in the file and see whats in it.
2012-11-18T21:20:00.000Z	dr_willis		see who owns the files.. they should all be owned by your user and not root
2012-11-18T21:20:00.000Z	ert3go	dr_willis	yeah , it has 1 bookmark which I could do
2012-11-18T21:21:00.000Z	ert3go		 ls -l .gtk-bookmarks
2012-11-18T21:21:00.000Z	ert3go		-rw-rw-r-- 1 username username 337 Nov 18 21:24 .gtk-bookmarks
2012-11-18T21:21:00.000Z	dr_willis	ert3go	 you made a user with the name of 'username' ?
