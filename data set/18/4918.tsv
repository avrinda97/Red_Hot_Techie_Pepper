2009-12-29T10:04:00.000Z	chilli0	kinja-sheep	 I tryed the second already

2009-12-29T10:07:00.000Z	chilli0	kinja-sheep	How can I test if it has bluray compatabiltf
2009-12-29T10:24:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	chilli0	You tried it in VLC?
2009-12-29T10:25:00.000Z	chilli0	kinja-sheep	 I dont think it suports it
2009-12-29T10:26:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	chilli0	The problem is the security measure taking places. They're making it harder and harder.
2009-12-29T10:27:00.000Z	chilli0	kinja-sheep	 I know
2010-03-14T17:19:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	chilli0	The best way is to test it yourself.
2010-03-14T17:19:00.000Z	chilli0	kinja-sheep	 Well, It didn't work last night . Wasn't sure why.
2010-03-14T17:20:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	chilli0	See what jrib said. You will have to use "DISPLAY=:0 limewire" as to indict which display/monitor to use
2010-03-14T17:21:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	chilli0	You always can test it by "ssh localhost" then run the program. :o
2010-03-14T17:23:00.000Z	chilli0	kinja-sheep	 That crashes , just after it starts up

2010-03-14T17:25:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	chilli0	Read the error message. Were you able to launch limewire just fine in the terminal?
2010-03-14T17:25:00.000Z	chilli0	kinja-sheep	 I just ran it again. But no errors ? strange
