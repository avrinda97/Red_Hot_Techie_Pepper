2009-07-21T09:48:00.000Z	alkasmolik		okay, i have a question and i dont mean to sound "cocky" but if ubuntu will NOT transfer to my usb  drive at acceptable speeds and there is no fix, WHAT distro will?  I dont want to migrate away from ubuntu persay, i just want to move my gigs of files over without it taking 7 weeks
2009-07-21T09:48:00.000Z	alkasmolik		anyone? please?
2009-07-21T09:49:00.000Z	new2linx	alkasmolik	huh? how much data are you transferring to usb?
2009-07-21T09:50:00.000Z	alkasmolik	new2linx	all AVI files 800mb~ about 50gb
2009-07-21T09:51:00.000Z	new2linx	alkasmolik	i am not aware of any issue with the usb stack in ubuntu? how long are you saying it takes to transfer 1gb?
2009-07-21T09:52:00.000Z	new2linx	alkasmolik	it sounds like you may have to play around with xandr so that you can use the correct res, sometimes the card can't get the info from old monitors
2009-07-21T09:52:00.000Z	alkasmolik	new2linx	tritium, speeds are 7mb/sec to my brandnew cruzer 8gb usb stick  max..  speeds are  around 1.2mb/sec for my External HDD
2009-07-21T09:53:00.000Z	alkasmolik	new2linx	wrong person?
2009-07-21T09:53:00.000Z	new2linx	alkasmolik	then that means that the usb board in the external hdd is probably the old standard 1.1 and not 2.0
2009-07-21T09:53:00.000Z	alkasmolik	new2linx	no its advertised as 2.0
2009-07-21T09:54:00.000Z	alkasmolik	new2linx	how do i use dmesg to show usb verbose?
2009-07-21T09:55:00.000Z	new2linx	alkasmolik	what do you mean?
2009-07-21T09:55:00.000Z	new2linx	alkasmolik	you mean "lsusb -v"
2009-07-21T09:56:00.000Z	alkasmolik	new2linx	no i don't
2009-07-21T09:56:00.000Z	new2linx	alkasmolik	than what do you want to know about usb?
2009-07-21T09:56:00.000Z	alkasmolik	new2linx	 dmesg | grep -i usb
2009-07-21T10:01:00.000Z	alkasmolik	new2linx	tritium one sec
2009-07-21T10:02:00.000Z	alkasmolik	new2linx	tritium http://pastebin.ca/1501748   does that mean anything to you?
