2005-02-09T13:30:00.000Z	delltony		question is there a reason why when i try sudo apt-cache update it gives me invalid operation?
2005-02-09T13:30:00.000Z	delltony		i tried sudo
2005-02-09T13:31:00.000Z	delltony		says can't stat source package
2005-02-09T13:33:00.000Z	delltony		after you cahnge the sources.list its just apt-cache update right?
2005-02-09T13:33:00.000Z	delltony		aww
2005-02-09T13:34:00.000Z	delltony		thats more better :p
2005-02-09T13:34:00.000Z	delltony		haha
2005-02-09T13:34:00.000Z	eyequeue	delltony	 get, not cache
2005-02-24T16:11:00.000Z	eyequeue	delltony	 dist-upgrade
2005-04-07T09:21:00.000Z	eyequeue	delltony	 reiserfs.  it never did that for me, on a debian box, can't offer any other suggestions though
2005-04-07T09:22:00.000Z	eyequeue	delltony	 i gather you typically do a proper shutdown?
2005-04-07T09:23:00.000Z	eyequeue	delltony	 ah
2005-04-07T09:23:00.000Z	eyequeue	delltony	 so basically, if you could get it "clean" it would probably stay that way again?
2005-04-07T09:25:00.000Z	eyequeue	delltony	 have you tried booting in "recovery mode" yet?
2005-04-07T09:26:00.000Z	eyequeue	delltony	 well, on the way in, it should fsck for you
2005-04-07T09:26:00.000Z	eyequeue	delltony	if not, the next thing i would try is booting from rescue media, either the livecd or isstall cd, or knoppix or whatever, heh.  then fsck the partition in question, with it NOT mounted
2005-04-07T09:27:00.000Z	eyequeue	delltony	 i'm not familiar with forcefsck
2005-04-07T09:28:00.000Z	eyequeue	delltony	 i imagine you may have typoed just now, but be sure you didn't on the filesystem
