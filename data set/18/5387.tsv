2009-08-07T11:46:00.000Z	nsgn		a quick wtf. i was copying a file from my local filesystem to a samba share. network connectivity was lost during the transfer and it failed out gracefully via a notification. the problem? the file now exists ONLY in it's partial form on the smb share. the local copy was deleted. WTF?
2009-08-07T11:47:00.000Z	firecrotch	nsgn	perhaps there's a temp file somewhere?
2009-08-07T11:47:00.000Z	firecrotch	nsgn	Was it a true "copy" operation, or a "move" ?
2009-08-07T11:48:00.000Z	nsgn	firecrotch	why should there be? i was simply doing a drag and drop
2009-08-07T11:48:00.000Z	nsgn		if dragging and dropping to a samba share is a "move" that isn't a safe move under ubuntu....that's horrible
2009-08-07T11:49:00.000Z	nsgn		even in "move" situations, the original should only be deleted upon success of the transfer. this failed out gracefully so ubuntu had the chance to know it failed and should NOT have performed deletion if it was indeed a move
2009-08-07T11:49:00.000Z	firecrotch	nsgn	I agree
2009-08-07T11:49:00.000Z	nsgn		however, most OSes treat a drag and drop operation to a non local filesystem as a copy unless specified otherwise
2009-08-07T11:50:00.000Z	nsgn		so seriously, what the hey went down here? it was just a backup file i was transferring, fortunately...but it really harms my trust in ubuntu for the first time. i've never straight up had a file blown away like that
2009-08-07T11:50:00.000Z	firecrotch	nsgn	I recommend filing a bug report on it
2009-08-07T11:51:00.000Z	nsgn		i guess i'm just surprised to find such a bug in ubuntu. i'm a new, as of about two months, user. it's been solid and reliable. i use it for business on my laptop. is it really unpolished enough for such an obvious and common thing to lack simple protective measures?
2009-08-07T11:52:00.000Z	nsgn		that should be elementary in the train of thought of whoever's writing the move functionality. if it doesnt move fully, by god don't go nuking the original!
2009-08-07T11:52:00.000Z	firecrotch	nsgn	It's very likely that it's an issue that only occurs under an obscure set of circumstances
2009-08-07T11:53:00.000Z	firecrotch	nsgn	Can you try to reproduce it?
2009-08-07T11:53:00.000Z	nsgn	firecrotch	i'd hope so, for their sensibility's sake, however i'm on a pretty freaking standard setup. unmodified installation of 9.04, samba server proven reliable
2009-08-07T11:53:00.000Z	nsgn	firecrotch	i've gotta sleep now, but i'll do so tomorrow. will take overnight to re-generate my backup archive anyway
2009-08-07T11:54:00.000Z	firecrotch	nsgn	mind if I PM you?
2009-08-07T11:54:00.000Z	nsgn	firecrotch	go
