2010-11-07T07:08:00.000Z	edbian	SC-M	Then open the update manager.  There should be a button. The upgrade will take like 1 hr (and it will probably ask you questions)
2010-11-07T07:08:00.000Z	edbian	SC-M	just talk again?
2010-11-07T07:09:00.000Z	edbian	SC-M	I use gnome.
2010-11-07T07:12:00.000Z	edbian	SC-M	sudo gives you root for 1 command. If you are already root than you don't need to sudo.  You shouldn't be root generally though.
2010-11-07T07:19:00.000Z	edbian	SC-M	command to update to the latest release of Ubuntu
2010-11-07T07:20:00.000Z	edbian	SC-M	See what ubottu said to me?
2010-11-07T07:21:00.000Z	edbian	SC-M	Talk to IdleOne he will clear it up for you.
2010-11-07T07:23:00.000Z	SC-M	edbian	why it's not a good idea to use root?
2010-11-07T07:24:00.000Z	edbian	SC-M	It's ok to use it for what you have to.  It is improper to be root all the time because it makes it easier for people to attack you (installing malicious software and such).
2010-11-07T07:24:00.000Z	edbian	SC-M	That's fine.
2010-11-07T07:25:00.000Z	edbian	SC-M	It's being root for things that you don't have to that are a problem.  Like running firefox
2010-11-07T07:26:00.000Z	edbian	SC-M	basically yeah
2010-11-07T07:32:00.000Z	edbian	SC-M	If you change the name of root you might lose track of who root is
2010-11-07T07:37:00.000Z	edbian	SC-M	There are 0 known malware programs for linux in the wild.  There are many proof of concept viruses.
2010-11-07T07:37:00.000Z	edbian	SC-M	It is a touchy subject that often starts an argument.
