2007-07-29T16:59:00.000Z	jmchaffie		Trying to playback DVD i-robot. Just re-installed. had no probs before. Followed directions on web. perhaps I missed something... Any help?
2007-07-29T05:00:00.000Z	jmchaffie		It plays warning and rating intro, then quits... ???
2007-07-29T05:01:00.000Z	jmchaffie		Anyone have time to field a DVD playback question? It plays the warning and rating, then kicks out.

2007-07-31T06:18:00.000Z	ShackJack	jmchaffie	Are you doing dual monitors or anything fancy?   What do you have driver listed as in xorg.conf?
2007-07-31T06:19:00.000Z	jmchaffie	ShackJack	Nothing special - Driver "nvidia" - (card - 7600 GT) - restricted drivers work once - work great in fact - then reboot and gui is dead (although you can login blind and hear sound)
2007-07-31T06:20:00.000Z	ShackJack	jmchaffie	so on subsequent boots it just boots to black screen (upon going into gdm)?
2007-07-31T06:21:00.000Z	jmchaffie	ShackJack	Exactly, and once in a while, if I revert to a vesa driver, then reinstall the restricted drivers... it will work again, until I reboot. It's like nothing I've ever come accross...
2007-07-31T06:22:00.000Z	ShackJack	jmchaffie	I can tell you I've had similar issue with my LCD where it didn't like the refresh rate/resolution being passed by the card... I solved it by "forcing" the refresh rates in xorg.conf specified in monitor manual...
2007-07-31T06:23:00.000Z	jmchaffie	ShackJack	Ok, I will try to find resolutions... I figured that might be the case, but I can't find out... it SHOULD be around 75 Hz
2007-07-31T06:24:00.000Z	ShackJack	jmchaffie	You're familiar with xorg, I trust?
2007-07-31T06:24:00.000Z	jmchaffie	ShackJack	Yes, quite a bit, but the sync area to be honest... I've never had to deal with both horizontal AND vertical before, so I'm not sure what values to enter in there...
2007-07-31T06:25:00.000Z	ShackJack	jmchaffie	monitor docs should give you refresh rates for given resolutions... TO "force" I put VertRefresh (or whatever) 80.0-80.0 etc...
2007-07-31T06:26:00.000Z	jmchaffie	ShackJack	Ok, I will try forcing it with set values from the same rate-to-rate and see what I get. Appreciate the pointer, wasn't sure if I should go to the route or not.. Much appreciated. :)
2007-07-31T06:27:00.000Z	ShackJack	jmchaffie	Make backup of xorg ;)
2007-07-31T06:27:00.000Z	jmchaffie	ShackJack	Always ;)
2007-07-31T06:27:00.000Z	ShackJack	jmchaffie	Don't be afraid to reinstall driver too - sometimes it gets borked :)
2007-07-31T06:28:00.000Z	jmchaffie	ShackJack	Yeah, been there and done that several times to be sure... will give it a go after refresh rates though if still a problem.
