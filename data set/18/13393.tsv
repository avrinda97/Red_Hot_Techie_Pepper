2006-12-16T06:55:00.000Z	khaled		hello there, i noticed that the latest version of openoffice is 2.1, can i get this version using apt-get?
2006-12-16T06:56:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	khaled	check in the backports repo
2006-12-16T06:56:00.000Z	khaled	nolimitsoya	how can i do that?
2006-12-16T06:56:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	khaled	do what?
2006-12-16T06:57:00.000Z	khaled	nolimitsoya	how can i check in the backport repo?
2006-12-16T07:01:00.000Z	khaled	nolimitsoya	i didn't find it
2006-12-16T07:02:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	khaled	then it isnt backported. any good reason to have it?
2006-12-16T07:03:00.000Z	khaled	nolimitsoya	i read that the developers of this release really recommend to have it as it had many new and upgraded features
2006-12-16T07:04:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	khaled	if you realy need them youll have to package and install it yourself
2006-12-16T07:05:00.000Z	khaled	nolimitsoya	ok thanks
2006-12-24T07:26:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	khaled	sudo apt-get install openoffice?
2006-12-24T07:26:00.000Z	khaled	nolimitsoya	2.1?
2006-12-24T07:26:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	khaled	if that version is too old, try the backports repo
2006-12-24T07:27:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	khaled	is there some good reason for wanting the latest version - some new killer must have feature?
2006-12-24T07:28:00.000Z	khaled	nolimitsoya	not really i just want to try it, i didn't know it is a big deal!
2006-12-24T07:29:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	khaled	it isnt. :) i just want to point out that using bleeding edgy software for the sake if it is bound to break sometime. :) best keep to the (reasonably) well tested versions in the repos
2006-12-24T07:29:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	khaled	that is, unless there is some new feature/bugfix that is a real must have...
2006-12-24T07:30:00.000Z	khaled	nolimitsoya	thx for the good advise
