2009-08-01T22:57:00.000Z	guest12345		i just installed ubuntu and it will not allow me to update it. it says that i don't have enough disk space. but i have well over 15 gigs of free memory. i also have windows xp on this computer, could that be causing problems?
2009-08-01T22:58:00.000Z	guest12345		not sure, hold on

2009-08-01T22:59:00.000Z	grawity	guest12345	Well, you don't have _any_ free space.
2009-08-01T23:00:00.000Z	grawity	guest12345	tmpfs, varrun, varlock, and udev are _virtual_ filesystems - they only exist in RAM.
2009-08-01T23:01:00.000Z	grawity	guest12345	First, Ubuntu doesn't know about your Windows partition yet.
2009-08-01T23:01:00.000Z	grawity	guest12345	Second, you _must_ have free space in the Ubuntu partition for it to work correctly.
2009-08-01T23:02:00.000Z	grawity	guest12345	"sudo aptitude install gparted"
2009-08-01T23:04:00.000Z	grawity	guest12345	It just doesn't show anything, but it does accept the password.
2009-08-01T23:06:00.000Z	grawity	guest12345	You can just resize the partitions.
2009-08-01T23:10:00.000Z	grawity	guest12345	Go to http://paste.ubuntu.com/, paste your text there, click Submit, and give us the address.
2009-08-01T23:12:00.000Z	grawity	guest12345	Yes.
2009-08-01T23:13:00.000Z	grawity	guest12345	If you had any free space in /, I would ask you to add this line to /etc/fstab... /dev/sda1 /media/windows ntfs-3g auto,fmask=0111,dmask=0000,utf8,uid=1000 0 0
