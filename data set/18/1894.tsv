2012-03-11T01:32:00.000Z	pfifo	KM0201	you can specify the size of the partition, windows does support dual booting mutiple windows OS

2012-03-11T01:37:00.000Z	KM0201	pfifo	it's not like your'e telling him to steal it.. he has a legit key, just has to download an ISO( which is perfectly legal)
2012-03-13T05:06:00.000Z	KM0201	pfifo	i thought it was /etc/samba/smb.conf
2012-03-13T05:07:00.000Z	pfifo	KM0201	I am not sure how ubuntu does it, I dont use windows
2012-03-13T05:07:00.000Z	KM0201	pfifo	i'm not sure what windows has to do w/ Ubuntu samba configuration, but anyway, Silver26 the configuration for samba is in /etc/samba/smb.conf
2012-03-13T05:08:00.000Z	pfifo	KM0201	not using windows means that I have no reason to use samba ^^
2012-03-13T05:08:00.000Z	KM0201	pfifo	ah, ok.
