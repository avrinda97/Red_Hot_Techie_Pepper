2004-11-25T17:57:00.000Z	TheMuso		Ah right.
2004-11-25T17:57:00.000Z	TheMuso		I have no experience with that module. That is probably the Envy24 HT chipset then. Does envy24control work with that?
2004-11-25T17:58:00.000Z	TheMuso		That is because there doesn't seem to be one.
2004-11-25T17:59:00.000Z	TheMuso		Mine are called ADC etc, but are labeled front left, etc.
2004-11-25T06:01:00.000Z	Treenaks	TheMuso	uh. that's in ubuntu by default
2004-11-25T06:01:00.000Z	Treenaks	TheMuso	never compile a package that's in a deb somewhere
2004-11-25T06:01:00.000Z	TheMuso	Treenaks	Where is it then?
2004-11-25T06:02:00.000Z	Treenaks	TheMuso	apt-cache search alsa
2004-11-25T06:02:00.000Z	TheMuso	Treenaks	But alsa-tools does NOT exist.
2004-11-25T06:02:00.000Z	Treenaks	TheMuso	maybe it's named differently
2004-11-25T06:03:00.000Z	TheMuso	Treenaks	Well if it was there, a search for envy24, or even envy should bring up someting. However nothing shows its head.
2004-11-25T06:03:00.000Z	Treenaks		alsa-utils - ALSA utilities
2004-11-25T06:03:00.000Z	TheMuso	Treenaks	Search for alsa-tools and you will get nothing.
2004-11-25T06:03:00.000Z	Treenaks	TheMuso	it's called alsa-utils!
2004-11-25T06:03:00.000Z	TheMuso	Treenaks	If I knew of a package for envy24control, I would have pointed right at it.
2004-11-25T06:04:00.000Z	Treenaks	TheMuso	have you filed a bug that this isn't packaged?
2004-11-25T06:04:00.000Z	TheMuso	Treenaks	it does NOT come in alsa-utils.
2004-11-25T06:04:00.000Z	TheMuso	Treenaks	No, but I will.
