2011-02-02T14:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	llutz_	Most of the time it's better to use "!factoid | nick" rather than "!factoid > nick" so that the message is displayed in channel rather than in a PM (some people don't like being PMd, and others new to IRC might not notice it at all).

2011-02-15T14:16:00.000Z	llutz_	Jordan_U	thanks, but ifupdown is much easier and well known :)
2011-03-16T11:57:00.000Z	Jordan_U	llutz_	Linux needs to come first.
2011-03-16T12:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	llutz_	My guess is that tab completion isn't working because the path should be /boot/vmlin<tab> not /vmlin<tab> (but it's still probably easier to just work from the liveCD).
2011-03-16T12:04:00.000Z	llutz_	Jordan_U	argh, you're right, my bad
2011-03-16T12:04:00.000Z	llutz_	Jordan_U	different when using boot-partition
2011-05-28T13:07:00.000Z	Jordan_U	llutz_	Dr_Willis: tar won't restore labels either :) You can set UUIDs manually at any time.
2011-05-28T13:07:00.000Z	llutz_	Jordan_U	no need if you use labels (and use them when creating new fs too)
2011-05-28T13:08:00.000Z	llutz_	Jordan_U	but you're right, tar won't care about all that. admin has to
2011-05-31T13:24:00.000Z	Jordan_U	llutz_	grub2 has no problem with being installed to a partition that any other *NIX bootloader doesn't also have. Grub2 is just more explicit about warning the user about it than other bootloaders.
2011-05-31T13:25:00.000Z	llutz_	Jordan_U	not according to my experience
2011-12-07T22:17:00.000Z	Jordan_U	llutz_	No, that will cause word splitting problems that didn't exist before. That is exactly the wrong thing to do.
2011-12-07T22:18:00.000Z	llutz_	Jordan_U	if you quote it properly, nothing will be splitted
2011-12-07T22:19:00.000Z	Jordan_U	llutz_	You did not quote things correctly, and I'm not sure how you would modify your command to be correct. I don't think it can sanely be done.
2011-12-07T22:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	llutz_	Do you understand why the command you gave will not work with files that have spaces in them?
2011-12-07T22:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U	llutz_	By the time you're quoting "$file" it's too late, the word splitting has already happened (in your command).
