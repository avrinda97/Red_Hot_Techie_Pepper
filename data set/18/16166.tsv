2006-08-24T14:44:00.000Z	Smeggy		So, can someone tell me how much space a default Ubuntu install takes?
2006-08-24T14:46:00.000Z	Smeggy		Hmm, I want to put Ubuntu on my ibook and I can only spare 5gig, is that going to be enough?
2006-08-24T14:46:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Smeggy	yes, but you won't have a lot of room to expand :)
2006-08-24T14:47:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Smeggy	yes, you can
2006-08-24T14:47:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Smeggy	you will need an fstab line
2006-08-24T14:49:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Smeggy	I hve this line ( yours will vary according to where your mac stuff lives)
2006-08-24T14:50:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Smeggy	if you want it to mount on boot you would use "auto" instead of "noauto"
2006-08-24T14:50:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Smeggy	yes I have an iBook G4 running 6.06
2006-08-24T14:50:00.000Z	Smeggy	thoreauputic	how's your battery life compared to osx?
2006-08-24T14:51:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Smeggy	about the same - I  get 5 hours in light use with the screen dimmed a bit, and around 4 hours in heavier use
2006-08-24T14:52:00.000Z	Smeggy	thoreauputic	cool :)
2006-08-24T14:52:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Smeggy	but I don't do heavy stuff on the iBook much - except the occasional compiling
2006-08-24T14:53:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Smeggy	Ubuntu is more responsive than MAc OS-X - and I rarely use Os-X
2006-08-24T15:07:00.000Z	Smeggy	thoreauputic	did you install any laptop specific tools to get that kind of battery life? hd-spin down utils or anthing?
2006-08-24T15:07:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Smeggy	no
2006-08-24T15:07:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Smeggy	tha't what I get out of the box
2006-08-24T15:08:00.000Z	Smeggy	thoreauputic	excellent, thanks.  sorry to be a pest, haven't encountered any live ibook using ubuntu people to talk to yet and I plan on converting my laptop fully sometime soon :)
2006-08-24T15:08:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Smeggy	as i said though, that's with pretty light use ( text, a bit of music et)
