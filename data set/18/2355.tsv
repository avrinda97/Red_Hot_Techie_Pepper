2010-11-03T23:39:00.000Z	T-rock007	brontoeee	what do u think
2010-11-03T23:40:00.000Z	T-rock007		Who thinks that you should stay with Ubuntu 10.04 or go to Ubuntu 10.10
2010-11-03T23:40:00.000Z	brontoeee	T-rock007	nothing much but this: 1. i'am to lazy to reinstall to use 10.10, 2. i dont want to bother with some sort of upgrade that will break everything, 3. i can run 10.10 in virtual machines to play around if i need to
2010-11-03T23:41:00.000Z	brontoeee	T-rock007	oh and 4. 10.04 is marked as LTS
2010-11-03T23:42:00.000Z	T-rock007	brontoeee	which means it will be supported for 3 years
2010-11-03T23:42:00.000Z	brontoeee	T-rock007	thats good enough for desktop for me
2010-11-03T23:43:00.000Z	brontoeee	T-rock007	i'am still running two 9.10 servers btw
2010-11-03T23:43:00.000Z	T-rock007	brontoeee	i think i will reinstall to Ubuntu 10.04 and start using it again
