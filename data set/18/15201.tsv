2007-12-14T22:44:00.000Z	Klockwinder		:(
2007-12-14T22:45:00.000Z	Klockwinder		My maximum resolution is 640x480 but it should be 1024x786
2007-12-14T22:46:00.000Z	Klockwinder		Can anyone help me correctly install video and audio drivers?
2007-12-14T22:47:00.000Z	Klockwinder		:(
2007-12-14T22:47:00.000Z	Klockwinder		It's an ATi Xpress 200
2007-12-14T22:47:00.000Z	Klockwinder		There is a driver on add/remove but last time it broke everything
2007-12-14T22:48:00.000Z	Klockwinder		I just kept getting "signal over range"
2007-12-14T22:48:00.000Z	nickrud	Klockwinder	I have one of those pos's , could you put a copy of your /var/log/Xorg.0.log on http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org
2007-12-14T22:49:00.000Z	nickrud	Klockwinder	it's probably a horiz & vert refresh issue for the monitor
2007-12-14T22:51:00.000Z	nickrud	Klockwinder	gedit /var/log/Xorg.0.log will open it read only
2007-12-14T22:56:00.000Z	nickrud	Klockwinder	looking
2007-12-14T22:57:00.000Z	nickrud	Klockwinder	for some reason you are running the vesa driver; try sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg , and choose ati for the driver
2007-12-14T23:00:00.000Z	nickrud	Klockwinder	you also chose the ati driver?
2007-12-14T23:02:00.000Z	nickrud	Klockwinder	darn reconfigure has been altered since I last ran it; try logging out, hit ctl-alt-backspace, log back in. We'll go from there
2007-12-14T23:03:00.000Z	nickrud	Klockwinder	might well do so. If so, we'll try altering the xorg.conf by hand just a tiny bit
2007-12-14T23:25:00.000Z	nickrud	Klockwinder	I'm back now as well
2007-12-14T23:26:00.000Z	nickrud	Klockwinder	so, still sameo sameo
2007-12-14T23:26:00.000Z	nickrud	Klockwinder	np, I'll be working at my desk for a bit
