2006-10-23T05:56:00.000Z	Flannel	Noob1	What error did you get? since, that does work
2006-10-23T05:57:00.000Z	Flannel	Noob1	what error/response/etc did you get?
2006-10-23T06:00:00.000Z	Flannel	Noob1	pastebin your sources.list
2006-10-23T06:00:00.000Z	Flannel	Noob1	/etc/apt/sources.list
2006-10-23T06:02:00.000Z	Flannel	Noob1	you need to open that in a text editor
2006-10-23T06:03:00.000Z	Flannel	Noob1	nano /etc/apt/sources.list
2006-10-23T06:04:00.000Z	Noob1	Flannel	what do u want to know on all these pages
2006-10-23T06:04:00.000Z	Flannel	Noob1	you need to paste them into the pastebin
2006-10-23T06:04:00.000Z	Flannel	Noob1	are you SSHd in? or what?
2006-10-23T06:07:00.000Z	Flannel	Noob1	You can connect to IRC on the server version, 'irssi' is installed, and lynx is isntalled (thats a web browser)
2006-10-23T06:07:00.000Z	Flannel	Noob1	anyway, is the computer connected to the internet? we really need more information other than "it didn't work" to diagnose the problem
2006-10-23T06:08:00.000Z	Flannel	Noob1	you can install a GUI, but no it does't have a GUI installed by default
2006-10-23T06:09:00.000Z	Flannel	Noob1	sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop is how you install the GUI
2006-10-23T06:09:00.000Z	Flannel	Noob1	unless you want to reinstall entirely, in which case download the desktop or alternate (I suggest the latter) to install
2006-10-23T06:12:00.000Z	Flannel	Noob1	Right, you can install that later though
2006-10-23T06:13:00.000Z	Flannel	Noob1	that's how (the link ubotu gave you)
