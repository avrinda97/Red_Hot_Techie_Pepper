2006-05-05T09:08:00.000Z	sbassett516	yereth	I have been reading issues like this in the forums. Have not experienced this myself.
2006-05-05T09:08:00.000Z	yereth	sbassett516	any clue about a solution?
2006-05-05T09:09:00.000Z	sbassett516	yereth	the only solution that was offered up was to modify the menu.lst file on each upgrade
2006-05-05T09:09:00.000Z	yereth	sbassett516	modify how?
2006-05-05T09:10:00.000Z	yereth	sbassett516	I mean, the root drive is indicated correctly in menu.lst

2006-05-05T09:13:00.000Z	sbassett516	yereth	brb
2006-05-05T09:18:00.000Z	sbassett516	yereth	your menu.lst matches up with your /etc/fstab, correct?
