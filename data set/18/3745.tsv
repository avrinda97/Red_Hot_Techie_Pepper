2010-02-23T12:58:00.000Z	dsnyders	darolu	I thought the recommendation was for 1.5* your ram?
2010-02-23T12:59:00.000Z	darolu	dsnyders	I don't follow that recommendation, it is deprecated IMO, now there are systems with up to 8 or even 16GB and 4-8GB swaps are ridiculous imo (specially with home desktops)
2010-02-23T13:00:00.000Z	dsnyders	darolu	Well, it has been a few years since I saw that recomendation (ie, back in the sub gigabyte ram days).
2010-02-23T13:02:00.000Z	darolu	dsnyders	any text editor should get the work done
2010-02-23T13:03:00.000Z	dsnyders	darolu	I was hoping for something that didn't require me spending half an hour trying to unravel how xorg.conf works.
2010-02-23T13:04:00.000Z	darolu	dsnyders	if you don't want learn how xorg.conf works you can use your video driver utilities to configure it; other option is xrandr
2010-02-23T13:05:00.000Z	dsnyders	darolu	my xserver is dishing out video that my monitor can't display.  The driver utils are useless without a display.  I'll check xrander.
2010-02-23T13:05:00.000Z	darolu	dsnyders	that kind of tools would help you with video configurations; other components like mice, keyboards, etc., won't be configured with them
2010-02-25T08:11:00.000Z	darolu	dsnyders	xrandr would be my guess
2010-03-03T11:12:00.000Z	darolu	dsnyders	Blender
2010-03-03T11:14:00.000Z	dsnyders	darolu	I tried Blender once.  It was unintuitive.
2010-03-03T11:18:00.000Z	darolu	dsnyders	it is very different than other apps, it is true, after a while you get used to it, in my opinion is the most -complete- opensource 3D software; there are other options though  K3D is not entirely bad.
2010-03-03T11:25:00.000Z	dsnyders	darolu	Blender looks like it can do animations.  Hmm... that may be interesting later on.
2010-03-03T11:26:00.000Z	darolu	dsnyders	oh yeah, actually there are some films made entirely in Blender, like Elephants Dream and Big Buck Bunny. Give it a try, you may want to try K3D too, is not bad.
2010-03-03T11:26:00.000Z	dsnyders	darolu	A look at k3d is my next step.
2010-03-03T11:37:00.000Z	dsnyders	darolu	can blender load kpovmodeler files?
2010-03-03T11:42:00.000Z	darolu	dsnyders	I don't really know if Blender loads kpovmodeler files as I have never used kpovmodeler but considering both are open source projects chances are very good it does
2010-03-03T11:44:00.000Z	dsnyders	darolu	Thanks for the pointers.
