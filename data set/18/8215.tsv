2008-11-01T20:52:00.000Z	DoYouKnow		how do I get intrepid to recognize gnash?
2008-11-01T20:52:00.000Z	DoYouKnow		well, firefox/konqueror
2008-11-01T20:53:00.000Z	dli_	DoYouKnow	install konqueror-plugin-gnash mozilla-plugin-gnash
2008-11-01T20:54:00.000Z	DoYouKnow	dli_	thnx
2008-11-01T20:58:00.000Z	DoYouKnow	dli_	that isn't working
2008-11-01T20:59:00.000Z	dli_	DoYouKnow	try to remove other players
2008-11-01T20:59:00.000Z	DoYouKnow	dli_	macromedia flash is showing up in konquerer, but not gnash
2008-11-01T21:00:00.000Z	dli_	DoYouKnow	remove flashplugin-nonfree
2008-11-01T21:02:00.000Z	DoYouKnow	dli_	ok, that seemed to work partially. I'm trying to get the videos at milw0rm.com to play
2008-11-01T21:03:00.000Z	DoYouKnow	dli_	the videos still don't load
2008-11-01T21:03:00.000Z	DoYouKnow	dli_	but there is a "waiting" symbol near my pointer
2008-11-01T21:03:00.000Z	dli_	DoYouKnow	it waits forever?
2008-11-01T21:04:00.000Z	DoYouKnow	dli_	yeah, but when I switch screens then go back the waiting thing is gone
2008-11-01T21:04:00.000Z	DoYouKnow	dli_	when I switch windows, rather
2008-11-01T21:08:00.000Z	DoYouKnow	dli_	ok, I got gnash to work by removing all flash-related plugins and going through the graphical wizard in firefox
2008-11-01T21:08:00.000Z	DoYouKnow	dli_	thnx
2008-11-01T21:09:00.000Z	DoYouKnow	dli_	I think there was some type of conflict
2008-11-01T21:09:00.000Z	dli_	DoYouKnow	yes, since there are three available players
