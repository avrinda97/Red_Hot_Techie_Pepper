2009-11-03T01:56:00.000Z	Lostinspace_46	trism	Got it...Thanks
2009-11-03T02:00:00.000Z	Lostinspace_46	trism	From the network icon on the panel I chose Network Connections, but still don't see anything about ipv.  Not 6, not 4, not any?
2009-11-03T02:01:00.000Z	trism	Lostinspace_46	the settings are on separate tabs when you edit a connection
2009-11-03T02:02:00.000Z	Lostinspace_46	trism	Ichecked all the tabs
2009-11-03T02:02:00.000Z	trism	Lostinspace_46	I have no idea what you're trying to do, I just gave you the name of the key in firefox you were looking for
2009-11-03T02:03:00.000Z	Lostinspace_46	trism	I am trying to figure out why, with a D?L speed of 16Mb it takes 30 sec or more to open a web page
2009-11-03T02:04:00.000Z	trism	Lostinspace_46	no idea
2009-11-03T02:04:00.000Z	Lostinspace_46	trism	Ok, thanks
2010-01-09T00:22:00.000Z	trism	Lostinspace_46	assuming it is a deb package, did you forget the .deb?
2010-01-09T00:24:00.000Z	Lostinspace_46	trism	The command should move my .deb files to the specified dir. It is from this tut. http://mediakey.dk/~cc/howto-create-your-own-debian-or-ubuntu-package-repository/
2010-01-09T00:25:00.000Z	trism	Lostinspace_46	in that tutorial, the file ends in .deb (as do all deb packages)
2010-01-09T00:39:00.000Z	trism	Lostinspace_46	yes, I think the author is just using it as an example, I'm sure you can use any packages you want
2010-01-09T00:45:00.000Z	trism	Lostinspace_46	that is not what that command does at all, it copies 1 deb file (bzr-version.deb) into that directory
2010-01-09T00:47:00.000Z	trism	Lostinspace_46	what exactly are you trying to do?
2010-01-09T00:48:00.000Z	trism	Lostinspace_46	I'd rather not, I was just curious
2010-01-09T00:52:00.000Z	trism	Lostinspace_46	you don't need your own repo to install debs
2010-01-09T00:53:00.000Z	trism	Lostinspace_46	setting up your own repository is more so other people can have access to your packages, or if you want a local mirror to save bandwidth
