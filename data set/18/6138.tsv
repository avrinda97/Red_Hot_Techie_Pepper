2008-12-22T22:42:00.000Z	isle85		hello, I have a pb but I read a message that could be the fix I was looking for. The pb is that I don't understand where to "boot with a parameter irqfixup". someone could help ?
2008-12-22T22:42:00.000Z	hwilde	isle85	does your systme boot or not
2008-12-22T22:42:00.000Z	isle85		yeap
2008-12-22T22:43:00.000Z	hwilde	isle85	open a terminal type "gksu gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst"
2008-12-22T22:43:00.000Z	isle85	hwilde	yes, but I read that : "Dead USB after startup"           Re: Dead USB after strartup!

Without this option, my DV6119us would disable the usb ports shortly after bootup if nothing was plugged into the port. A message would appear about IRQ 7 and nobody cared. Adding irqfixup to the boot options kept the usb ports from being disabled.

2008-12-22T22:45:00.000Z	isle85		This is the problem hwilde : I typed what you said
2008-12-22T22:46:00.000Z	hwilde	isle85	ok good so now you have a text editor right ?
2008-12-22T22:47:00.000Z	isle85	hwilde	yes, but where to add that parameter ? which line ?
2008-12-22T22:47:00.000Z	hwilde	isle85	you are looking for a line near the top that says # kopt
2008-12-22T22:48:00.000Z	hwilde	isle85	delete the # sign so that line is uncommented, then add your irqfixup to the list of options
2008-12-22T22:48:00.000Z	isle85	hwilde	is it this one ? : # defoptions=quiet splash
2008-12-22T22:48:00.000Z	hwilde	isle85	you are looking for a line near the top that says # kopt
2008-12-22T22:49:00.000Z	hwilde	isle85	# kopt=root=UUID=a608355f-cfbe-4627-a7b3-c83942161322 ro
2008-12-22T22:49:00.000Z	isle85	hwilde	ok, I saw it. What to do if I can't boot with that new option
2008-12-22T22:50:00.000Z	hwilde	isle85	well you could/should try it manually first, if you hit ESC to get into grub, hit down to the kernel line, hit E to edit, go to the end of hte line and add the option you want to test, hit enter to boot.  if it works, make it permanent in the file
2008-12-22T22:51:00.000Z	isle85	hwilde	ok, thanks.
