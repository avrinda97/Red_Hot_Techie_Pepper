2008-04-10T23:03:00.000Z	peeps[work]		i have a problem running vmware on Ubuntu host OS. it constantly want's me to run the configuration.  every time i restart the host OS it seems
2008-04-10T23:04:00.000Z	peeps[work]		i get this message: vmware is installed, but it has not been (correctly) configured for this system. To (re-)configure it, invoke the following command: /usr/bin/vmware-config.pl.
2008-04-10T23:04:00.000Z	peeps[work]		anyone in here using vmware seen issues like this?
2008-04-10T23:05:00.000Z	peeps[work]		i've already configured vmware like 4 times
2008-04-10T23:07:00.000Z	Scunizi	peeps[work]	run that command using sudo
2008-04-10T23:07:00.000Z	peeps[work]	Scunizi	i do.  it doesn't even run without sudo IIRC
2008-04-10T23:07:00.000Z	peeps[work]	Scunizi	or do you mean to run vmware as sudo?
2008-04-10T23:09:00.000Z	Scunizi	peeps[work]	nope just the reconfig line..
2008-04-10T23:09:00.000Z	peeps[work]	Scunizi	yes, i run it as sudo, and then I can use vmware, but as soon as I restart, it forces me to run it all over again, it's really annoying
2008-04-10T23:10:00.000Z	Scunizi	peeps[work]	did you install vmware server or player.. I'm assuming server.. also when you installed did you install the entire package using sudo?
2008-04-10T23:11:00.000Z	Scunizi	peeps[work]	you there.. I was getting a lot of lag on this end.. netsplit? oh well.. did you get my last post about server vs. player?
2008-04-10T23:18:00.000Z	Scunizi	peeps[work]	did you totally disappear?
2008-04-10T23:18:00.000Z	peeps[work]	Scunizi	sorry, was in restroom
2008-04-10T23:19:00.000Z	peeps[work]	Scunizi	i am using vmware server
2008-04-10T23:19:00.000Z	peeps[work]	Scunizi	i honestly can't remember the method I used for the initial install
2008-04-10T23:20:00.000Z	Scunizi	peeps[work]	well.. you should have build-essential installed for the server install.. I choose all the defaults that come up during the install. maybe that makes a difference.. you might try purging it and reinstalling.. but you gotta make sure you get the config files deleted
2008-04-10T23:21:00.000Z	peeps[work]	Scunizi	ok, thanks
2008-04-10T23:23:00.000Z	Scunizi	peeps[work]	I hope it works..
