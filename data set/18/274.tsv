2012-05-13T06:50:00.000Z	Floyd42		kenshizl: what's up?
2012-05-13T06:52:00.000Z	Kenshizl	Floyd42	The home folder is telling me that I only have about 4 Kb left in my hard drive, when in fact on Friday it had around 30Gb.
2012-05-13T06:53:00.000Z	Kenshizl	Floyd42	And it won't let me do anthing. I tried to add a few songs from our mac, and xubuntu popped up a sign saying "out of memory!"
2012-05-13T07:08:00.000Z	Kenshizl	Floyd42	How do I do it the terminal way?
2012-05-13T07:11:00.000Z	Kenshizl	Floyd42	What's a pm?
2012-05-13T07:17:00.000Z	Kenshizl	Floyd42	So far the biggest I've come across is the home folder which is 219Mb
2012-05-13T07:18:00.000Z	Kenshizl	Floyd42	/lib = 282M
2012-05-13T07:22:00.000Z	Kenshizl	Floyd42	Did you get my last message?
2012-05-13T07:29:00.000Z	Kenshizl	Floyd42	What log folders
2012-05-13T07:32:00.000Z	Kenshizl	Floyd42	Holy crap you're right. it says in the status bar: "46 items (31.0 GB), Free space: 0 Bytes
2012-05-13T07:32:00.000Z	Kenshizl	Floyd42	I really don't want to reinstall it. I finnaly got it to work right after 4 tries.
2012-05-13T07:34:00.000Z	Kenshizl	Floyd42	a file called "syslog" (with no extension) is 14 gb
2012-05-13T07:36:00.000Z	Kenshizl	Floyd42	Yeah, Leafpad won't open it. How do I split it up?
2012-05-13T07:38:00.000Z	Kenshizl	Floyd42	So far it's just two: "kern.log" (15.5GB), and "syslog" (14GB)
2012-05-13T07:41:00.000Z	Kenshizl	Floyd42	brb?
2012-05-13T07:43:00.000Z	Kenshizl	Floyd42	Oh. I was thinking along he lines of terminal commands. Sorry. Of course I know what brb is.
2012-05-13T07:48:00.000Z	Kenshizl	Floyd42	escott suggested "less", which is working so far.
2012-05-13T08:09:00.000Z	Kenshizl	Floyd42	I don't really get an error message. It just won't let me put anything on the hardrive because there is no disk space.
