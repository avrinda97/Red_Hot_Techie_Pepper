2009-12-22T20:12:00.000Z	phoenixzorn	ActionParsnip	wifi just dropped again for no reason on the netbook...
2009-12-22T20:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	phoenixzorn	ok cool run: dmesg | tail
2009-12-22T20:14:00.000Z	phoenixzorn	ActionParsnip	one sec... trying to get pastebin to load so I can... damn... dropped it again.
2009-12-22T20:14:00.000Z	phoenixzorn	ActionParsnip	just keeps saying authentication with AP timed out.
2009-12-22T20:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	phoenixzorn	you should also look in /etc/modprobe.d/  for a file name blacklist-ath5k or somesuch, make sure you are blacklisting ath_pci and ath_hal but NOT ath5k
2009-12-22T20:18:00.000Z	phoenixzorn	ActionParsnip	it says - in the blacklist-ath_pci.conf - that "For some atheros 5k RF MACs, the madwifi driver loads but fails to correctly initialize the hardware, leaving it in a state from which ath5k cannot recover.  To prevent this condition, stop madwifi from loading by default.  use Jockey to select one driver or the other. (Ubuntu: #315056, #323830)"
2009-12-22T20:19:00.000Z	phoenixzorn	ActionParsnip	how do I stop madwifi from running by default?
2009-12-22T20:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	phoenixzorn	there will be lines below that detailing blacklisted modules, blacklist all except ath5k
