2011-10-15T22:44:00.000Z	mlechner	guido1955	just ask
2011-10-15T22:47:00.000Z	mlechner	guido1955	what's wromg with the installer son the veetle HP
2011-10-15T22:48:00.000Z	mlechner	guido1955	what exactly did you do?
2011-10-15T23:01:00.000Z	mlechner	guido1955	yes was me
2011-10-15T23:09:00.000Z	mlechner	guido1955	did you try the *.sh installer (which shouldn't do anythnig different. What about the vlc plugin?
2011-10-15T23:16:00.000Z	mlechner	guido1955	veetle is just installing plugins in the home-folder of vlc nad firefox. If you are using sudo the plugins are installed for root only. try #sh veetle-0.9.17-linux-install.sh from the useraccount you want to use veetle. (Didn't know veetle before, but got it up and running in  oneiric directly
2011-10-15T23:16:00.000Z	guido1955	mlechner	that looks promising but could you make the instructions a little more idiot prrof :)
2011-10-15T23:19:00.000Z	mlechner	guido1955	easy: 1. download th *.sh installer from the veetle HP. 2. open a "terminal". 3. tcd to the directory veetle*.sh was downloaded to. 4. sh veetle-0.9.17-linux-install.sh 5. go through the installer process. 6. finished - shuld work, but has to be done for every user who wants to run veetle
2011-10-15T23:21:00.000Z	mlechner	guido1955	the open a terminal -> cd Desktop -> sh veetle-0.9.17-linux-install.sh ...ready
2011-10-15T23:24:00.000Z	guido1955	mlechner	Im sorry I dont know how to navigate to the desktop location using terminal commands, and if I just use sh veetle-0.9.17-linux-install.sh it says it can't open it?
2011-10-15T23:26:00.000Z	mlechner	guido1955	what gives you "pwd" and "ls"?
2011-10-15T23:32:00.000Z	mlechner	guido1955	it ended up and told me I could watch channels on some url and most often the prompt (where you can type commands) is visible again
2011-10-15T23:38:00.000Z	mlechner	guido1955	why do you think veetle is not available?
2011-10-15T23:40:00.000Z	mlechner	guido1955	do you have ~/.mozilla/plugins/libveetle-player-plugin.so ?
2011-10-15T23:42:00.000Z	mlechner	guido1955	this is the file installed by the installer. may be copy it there by hand?
2011-10-15T23:42:00.000Z	guido1955	mlechner	how would I do that?
2011-10-15T23:44:00.000Z	mlechner	guido1955	use the *.tar.gz version instead of the *.sh installer unpack this archive and copy the file to ~./.mozilla/plugins/ (may be you have to tell your filemanager to show hidden files. otherwise you win't be able to see folders and fiels beginning with a dot.
