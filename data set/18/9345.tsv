2008-05-26T08:29:00.000Z	koshari	harpreet	thats a software modem and you may have troble doing so
2008-05-26T08:31:00.000Z	koshari	harpreet	you would be better off buying a hardware modem for what its worth unfortinately,
2008-05-26T08:34:00.000Z	koshari	harpreet	dont you have a serial port?
2008-05-26T08:35:00.000Z	koshari	harpreet	if you can get the usb to recignise it i think it will be an easier task than the winmodem
2008-05-26T08:36:00.000Z	koshari	harpreet	are you sure its not a parralell port???  serials are always male on the PC
2008-05-26T08:36:00.000Z	koshari	harpreet	is it a 9 or 24 pin connector your looking at?
2008-05-26T08:38:00.000Z	koshari	harpreet	thats a juystick/midi port

2008-05-26T08:41:00.000Z	koshari	harpreet	yes thats what you would need, you might want to research what models people have had success with in linux
