2011-03-11T14:45:00.000Z	stylishg33k		Hello room. I'm a new  ubuntu user and I'm having some issues running the Netbook version of Ubuntu 10.10
2011-03-11T14:46:00.000Z	stylishg33k		I installed the os through the usb method (I'm running on an Alienware M11x R2) and everything worked great. I used the netbook edition, since I figured for the small size of this laptop, it'd be a better fit. However after I did all the updates (including a Nivida update which I'm thinking is the problem) i get to the tty1 command line
2011-03-11T14:47:00.000Z	stylishg33k		I edited the grub with "nomodeset" and I'm able to run ubuntu in the normal desktop safe mode (What I'm in now) but I want to know if I can get back to the netbook edition
2011-03-11T14:49:00.000Z	stylishg33k		I've already tried do the sudo commands related to the xorg.conf files and I tried the gdm commands
2011-03-11T14:51:00.000Z	stylishg33k		@coz take your time, I'm tryin to figure it out too lol
2011-03-11T14:53:00.000Z	stylishg33k		@coz That was something I considered but I wasn't sure what the right command would be.
2011-03-11T14:55:00.000Z	stylishg33k		coz, yes I tried that
2011-03-11T14:56:00.000Z	Chipzzz	stylishg33k	sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart
2011-03-11T14:58:00.000Z	stylishg33k	Chipzzz	would that restart the netbook gui?
2011-03-11T14:58:00.000Z	Chipzzz	stylishg33k	yes, it restarts gnome
2011-03-11T15:13:00.000Z	stylishg33k	Chipzzz	that command you suggested wasn't recongized
2011-03-11T15:15:00.000Z	Chipzzz	stylishg33k	curious... try "ls /etc/init.d/gdm"
2011-03-11T15:17:00.000Z	stylishg33k	Chipzzz	it returns that same value so it does exist
2011-03-11T15:18:00.000Z	Chipzzz	stylishg33k	maybe you'd better reboot & it'll restart for sure ;)
2011-03-11T15:30:00.000Z	stylishg33k	Chipzzz	I tried the command again and it returned a message telling me to instead of using it, run the regular gdm restart commant
2011-03-11T15:31:00.000Z	Chipzzz	stylishg33k	didn't you try that & find that it didn't work?
2011-03-11T15:32:00.000Z	stylishg33k	Chipzzz	I hadn't tried reinstalling, no. If you mean netbook edition, it worked at first but after I restarted due to the updates, it won't load. At first i got the tty1 command line, then when I get past it, I am stuck with a blank desktop
2011-03-11T15:37:00.000Z	Chipzzz	stylishg33k	sorry... I thought cos_ had you try "restart gdm" & it didn't work... do you currently boot to a tty command line with no gui?
