2010-07-13T19:35:00.000Z	Slart	icebreaker	backtrack has its own support channels
2010-07-13T19:38:00.000Z	Slart	icebreaker	writing kernel modules without lots of experience is like juggling with chain saws.. things get ugly unless you start with something easier =)
2010-07-13T19:40:00.000Z	Slart	icebreaker	users.. just like you.. most of us, anyway
2010-07-13T19:41:00.000Z	Slart	icebreaker	you write a kernel module..
2010-07-13T19:41:00.000Z	Slart	icebreaker	and if you have to ask.. you probably shouldn't
2010-07-13T19:42:00.000Z	Slart	icebreaker	there is source available for the different kernel modules that are available.. try to find something small and see how it's done
2010-07-13T19:43:00.000Z	Slart	icebreaker	but this channel is for ubuntu user support only.. so no more questions about it here.. try in #ubuntu-offtopic or perhaps ##linux
2010-07-13T19:44:00.000Z	Slart	icebreaker	type   /join #ubuntu-offtopic
