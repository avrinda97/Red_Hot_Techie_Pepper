2006-04-30T09:13:00.000Z	fsd		anyone have an idea why a ubuntu box running dhcp resorts back to its old dhcp address after a while, after ive changed it to a static address via ifconfig?
2006-04-30T09:13:00.000Z	fsd		5.10 installed
2006-04-30T09:14:00.000Z	fsd		fresh a couple of days ago
2006-04-30T09:14:00.000Z	DarkElf109	fsd	Try /etc/network/interfaces
2006-04-30T09:15:00.000Z	fsd		i was hoping not to touch interfaces :(
2006-04-30T09:15:00.000Z	fsd		oh well
2006-04-30T09:15:00.000Z	fsd		thanks for the help guys
2006-04-30T09:15:00.000Z	DarkElf109	fsd	You could use the network config dialog
2006-04-30T09:15:00.000Z	fsd		ssh only
2006-04-30T09:15:00.000Z	DarkElf109	fsd	Well, then, interfaces it is =)
2006-04-30T09:16:00.000Z	DarkElf109	fsd	You could always run a headless VNC, if you like GUIs and all that
2006-04-30T09:16:00.000Z	fsd		na no gui for me
2006-04-30T09:16:00.000Z	fsd		ill just do interfaces
