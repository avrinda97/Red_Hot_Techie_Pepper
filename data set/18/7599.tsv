2011-01-28T13:29:00.000Z	soreau	nunya	chmod -x /etc/init.d/bluetooth
2011-01-28T13:30:00.000Z	nunya	soreau	thank you, I'm going to give it a shot
2011-01-28T13:31:00.000Z	soreau	nunya	Use the same command but with +x to make it executable again
2011-01-28T13:32:00.000Z	nunya	soreau	ohhhhhhhhh I see... but I'd rather be able to just have it start up off, and then be able to work with the bluetooth applet to turn it on
2011-01-28T13:36:00.000Z	nunya	soreau	also, that command didn't work, does it matter that my bluetooth is usb external?
2011-01-28T13:37:00.000Z	soreau	nunya	It prevents the service from starting in the first place. To disable it, use 'sudo service bluetooth stop'
2011-01-28T13:38:00.000Z	nunya	soreau	bluetooth: unrecognized service
2011-01-28T13:38:00.000Z	soreau	nunya	What about 'sudo /etc/init.d/bluetooth stop' ?
2011-01-28T13:39:00.000Z	nunya	soreau	/etc/init.d/bluetooth: command not found
2011-01-28T13:39:00.000Z	nunya	soreau	though when i look into the /etc/init.d/ directory i see bluetooth there
2011-01-28T13:39:00.000Z	soreau	nunya	You have it -x'd
2011-01-28T13:39:00.000Z	nunya	soreau	ah, i'm gonna +x and try that last command
2011-01-28T13:39:00.000Z	soreau	nunya	You have to rerun the chmod command with +x for it to be recognized
2011-01-28T13:40:00.000Z	nunya	soreau	okay, now I get no response but bluetooth is still off... is there anyway to see what the command the applet is doing when it turns off the bluetooth, then I can just run that command at startup?
2011-01-28T13:41:00.000Z	nunya	soreau	I guess "no response" is a bad way to put it, i get no output, just a new command line
2011-01-28T13:42:00.000Z	soreau	nunya	try service bluetooth restart
2011-01-28T13:46:00.000Z	nunya	soreau	bluetooth still on, gives me no output
2011-01-30T05:04:00.000Z	soreau	nunya	Never run any user apps as root: sudo -i
