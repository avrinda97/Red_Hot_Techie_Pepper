2007-03-07T08:34:00.000Z	Pelo		evening folks
2007-03-07T08:35:00.000Z	Pelo		does anyone know if POWERNOWD supports Intel Celeron D 2.4 ?
2007-03-07T08:36:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	Pelo	I believe powernow supports Pentium 4 class CPUs
2007-03-07T08:36:00.000Z	Pelo	Ice_Wewe	  dum it down a bit for me ,  is a celeron D a pentim class 4 chip ?
2007-03-07T08:37:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	Pelo	well it's a Celeron D, so technically, no, but I think Powernow supports it
2007-03-07T08:38:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	Pelo	checking
2007-03-07T08:38:00.000Z	Pelo	Ice_Wewe	 thanks
2007-03-07T08:39:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	Pelo	well his site claims it supports AMD X2 and Intel Centrino, so I'd hazard a guess that it supports Celeron. Questions is whether the Celeron has more than two speed steps. I know my AMD64 only has 3, and the PIII's I have only have one speed
2007-03-07T08:40:00.000Z	Pelo	Ice_Wewe	 would such information be available in the tech sheet for my chip on the intel site ?
2007-03-07T08:40:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	Pelo	doubt it... chip manufacturers don't generally talk about the speed steps a CPU has. I've never seen one tell you what they are
2007-03-07T08:41:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	Pelo	find out if your Celeron has more than two speeds, if so, I'd hazard a guess that powernow supports it
2007-03-07T08:42:00.000Z	Pelo	Ice_Wewe	 I'm trhing to right now
2007-03-07T08:43:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	Pelo	unfortunately I have to go, hope you find the right information!
2007-04-21T16:48:00.000Z	Pelo	Ice_Wewe	automatix is not supported here, and not well liked,   beside you can insall what you get from it easily enough your self and learn smething in the process
2007-04-21T16:49:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	Pelo	I know, I use apt-get, and yum (on Fedora Core machines) whenever I install something, although I use synaptic for package searching
2007-04-21T16:49:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	Pelo	I was just wondering anyway, the next system I'm running on this computer is FC7
2007-04-21T16:49:00.000Z	Ice_Wewe	Pelo	(when it gets released)
2007-10-29T05:15:00.000Z	Pelo	Ice_Wewe	 I feel your pain
