2010-07-16T22:12:00.000Z	whysoserious		 realmatt (~matt@68.153.117.232)
2010-07-16T22:12:00.000Z	whysoserious		Show his IP on the login
2010-07-16T22:12:00.000Z	whysoserious		It was said to me, that you having an valid account, do not show the IP anymore on log
2010-07-16T22:12:00.000Z	whysoserious		*if you
2010-07-16T22:13:00.000Z	whysoserious		To hide, because...
2010-07-16T22:13:00.000Z	whysoserious		you know
2010-07-16T22:13:00.000Z	whysoserious		Let me ask
2010-07-16T22:13:00.000Z	whysoserious		Who is using Pidgin ritght now?
2010-07-16T22:14:00.000Z	sebsebseb	whysoserious	not right now, but yes I use Pidgin :)
2010-07-16T22:16:00.000Z	sebsebseb	whysoserious	most Desktop Linux users think that Pidgin and I guess Empathy as well, aren't that good for IRC.  Xchat is rather popular, but I am quite the Konversation fan myself :)  KDE app though, will want to put KDE stuff on if you don't  already have that,  not a problem at all,  as long as your partition isn't really silly sized.  Also Linux distros are basically designed to have loads of programs installed without issues, unlike Windows :)
2010-07-16T22:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	whysoserious	and if you want IRC in the terminal, theres IRSSI and weechat
2010-07-16T22:21:00.000Z	sebsebseb	whysoserious	for instant messaging services you will need an account, useually a email address.  For IRC you can useually chat without signing up on the network,  but its useaully a pretty good idea to register.
2010-07-16T22:22:00.000Z	sebsebseb	whysoserious	pick a name you want to use on Freenode, and register it
2010-07-16T22:22:00.000Z	sebsebseb	whysoserious	personalley I woudn't register the name your currently using though, if I was you
2010-07-16T22:22:00.000Z	sebsebseb	whysoserious	since you could come up with some better name, I expect :)
2010-07-16T22:24:00.000Z	sebsebseb	whysoserious	ip address will show,  but people can  hide their hostname once registered, if they ask #freenode
