2011-12-15T19:10:00.000Z	iceroot	GaRRu	not possible
2011-12-15T19:10:00.000Z	iceroot	GaRRu	only reverse-engineering
2011-12-15T19:10:00.000Z	GaRRu	iceroot	why not?
2011-12-15T19:11:00.000Z	GaRRu	iceroot	so it is possible
2011-12-15T19:11:00.000Z	iceroot	GaRRu	because you cant get source-code from binarys
2011-12-15T19:11:00.000Z	iceroot	GaRRu	its not
2011-12-15T19:11:00.000Z	iceroot	GaRRu	you can get asm-code but no c code or something like that
2011-12-15T19:12:00.000Z	GaRRu	iceroot	pfifo, I said a language that is read to man kind, that includes ASM,C,C++,Java,C# etc etc..
2011-12-15T19:12:00.000Z	iceroot	GaRRu	have fun to read big programs in asm
2011-12-15T19:13:00.000Z	GaRRu	iceroot	anyway to compile it to asm?
2011-12-15T19:13:00.000Z	iceroot	GaRRu	as i said, reverse-engineering
2011-12-15T19:13:00.000Z	iceroot	GaRRu	Disassembling with a Disassembler
2011-12-15T19:20:00.000Z	iceroot	GaRRu	you dont want a compiler
2011-12-15T19:20:00.000Z	iceroot	GaRRu	you want a decompiler
2011-12-15T19:21:00.000Z	iceroot	GaRRu	but trust me, you dont want that!!!
2011-12-15T19:21:00.000Z	iceroot	GaRRu	just buy your windows, dont put offtopic in this channel and so on
2011-12-15T19:21:00.000Z	GaRRu	iceroot	I know what your talking about xD I tried reading files of ASM codes, some took me ages. and yeah a decompiler :P
2011-12-15T19:22:00.000Z	GaRRu	iceroot	its not exactly for me :) Its for an entire community :D
