2008-09-14T13:21:00.000Z	zoed	Guest39780	Can you post your /boot/grub/menu.lst on paste.ubuntu.com?

2008-09-14T13:22:00.000Z	Guest39780	zoed	i want to boot the third option. http://paste.ubuntu.com/46814/
2008-09-14T13:24:00.000Z	zoed		Guest29780: can you mount your windows vista partition and tell me the /dev device of your windows vista partition?
2008-09-14T13:25:00.000Z	Guest39780		zod, sure, 2 seconds
2008-09-14T13:25:00.000Z	Guest39780	zoed	'it is already mounted to /mnt/vista
2008-09-14T13:25:00.000Z	zoed		Guest3978: sorry, I mean can you mount the partition you want to boot from (not vista) and tell me that /dev device... :)
2008-09-14T13:25:00.000Z	Guest39780	zoed	ok i will, 2 min
2008-09-14T13:26:00.000Z	zoed	Guest39780	I mean, is you linux from sratch partition /dev/sdb3, or what is it?
2008-09-14T13:26:00.000Z	Guest39780	zoed	yes it is
2008-09-14T13:27:00.000Z	Guest39780	zoed	i mounted it.
2008-09-14T13:28:00.000Z	zoed	Guest39780	that entry is missing a initrd, but i guess linux from scratch doesn't have you make one. Then: the root= kernel paramter is /dev/hd2? did you mean /dev/sdb3?
2008-09-14T13:29:00.000Z	Guest39780	zoed	i  tried /dev/sdb3 but it told me taht it isnt a valid linux block file
2008-09-14T13:29:00.000Z	zoed		Guest3970: maybe you have to use /dev/hdb3 ?
2008-09-14T13:29:00.000Z	Guest39780	zoed	i havent tried that
2008-09-14T13:30:00.000Z	Guest39780	zoed	i will try, give me 5 minutes
