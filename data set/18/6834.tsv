2008-03-19T00:06:00.000Z	gregory_	Christoz	maybe firestarter crashed?
2008-03-19T00:07:00.000Z	Christoz	gregory_	i've installed it again and again but the problem still occurs
2008-03-19T00:07:00.000Z	Christoz	gregory_	from the repositories and form firestarter's web page too
2008-03-19T00:08:00.000Z	gregory_	Christoz	better use repo version only
2008-03-19T00:08:00.000Z	Christoz	gregory_	i've tried both ways like i said but the problem still occurs
2008-03-19T00:10:00.000Z	gregory_	Christoz	sorry i dont know more to help you
2008-03-19T00:11:00.000Z	Christoz	gregory_	ok thanks ,when i was using the feisty version i'd no problem at all but this gutsy one ...i don't know it didn't impress me to tell you the truth
