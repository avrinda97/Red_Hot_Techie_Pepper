2011-10-30T04:06:00.000Z	beerios		Ok... anyone feeling particularly helpful today?
2011-10-30T04:07:00.000Z	beerios		with the /join command dewanna
2011-10-30T04:09:00.000Z	beerios		yeah
2011-10-30T04:09:00.000Z	beerios		I know it can be done, p1oooop, others have already done it. My only problem is that I don't have a valid ext2.ko module to insmod, and I need someone with the patience to talk me through making one or making one for me
2011-10-30T04:11:00.000Z	beerios		my phone's processor is an MT6516. Architecture is "armv5tejl" according to something I did.
2011-10-30T04:13:00.000Z	beerios		Something like that, p1oooop. I was hoping a linux whiz could help me with it. I don't need to have it automatically load during boot, I have root on the phone and busybox on it, and a terminal emulator, and the android debugger on my PC... If I can just get an ext2.ko that'll load when I try to insmod it, I'll be able to mount ext2 partitions, and I'll be all set to figure the rest out from there :)
2011-10-30T04:15:00.000Z	beerios		hrm
2011-10-30T04:16:00.000Z	beerios		I'll ask around again with the Android people... That was my first stop a couple of days ago, but it didn't get me anywhere... yet :P
2011-10-30T04:16:00.000Z	joao	beerios	you may want to get into the devs irc channel search google
2011-10-30T04:17:00.000Z	joao	beerios	google then
2011-10-30T04:23:00.000Z	joao	beerios	what is the purpose of your hacking? I did a couple of crazy things just for the fun of it but it was ages ago
2011-10-30T04:24:00.000Z	beerios	joao	I figure if I can chroot into ubuntu on my phone, it'll be far more useful to me for everything other than just calls and SMS, seeing as I'd be able to use ubuntu's packages to install whatever I wanted
2011-10-30T04:26:00.000Z	joao	beerios	so you want to chroot from ubuntu to the android file system, correct? or you want to chroot from android to your ubuntu?
2011-10-30T04:28:00.000Z	joao	beerios	and what your your connection? bluetooth? usb? do you know they work fine already I assume, no?
2011-10-30T04:28:00.000Z	joao	beerios	or you extracted a live image of ubuntu into the sd card?
2011-10-30T04:31:00.000Z	beerios	joao	I have a .img file that I assume was created with dd, it's like a whole partition in the file. The file was on the SD card, but I couldn't mount it, although my loop devices seem to be fine. It's the ext2 support that I don't have. I dropped some binaries onto the phone, and I can run e2fsck on the image file, and on an ext2 partition I created on the SD card, and that works. I just can't *mount* the ext2 partitions.

2011-10-30T04:38:00.000Z	joao	beerios	there was a time I had time and patience for kernel modules but now I can't compile much of anything now
