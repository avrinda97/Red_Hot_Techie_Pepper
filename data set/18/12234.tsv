2008-08-26T12:21:00.000Z	gaurav__		i am trying to install helix player
2008-08-26T12:21:00.000Z	gaurav__		but couldn't
2008-08-26T12:21:00.000Z	ikonia	gaurav__	helix-player is in the repo's
2008-08-26T12:26:00.000Z	ikonia	gaurav__	use the package in the repo
2008-08-26T12:27:00.000Z	ikonia	gaurav__	how is helix going to help that ?
2008-08-26T12:29:00.000Z	ikonia	gaurav__	gnash is not very advanced, so I wouldn't use tht if you want advanved flash stuff it won't work
2008-08-26T12:29:00.000Z	ikonia	gaurav__	the flashplugin-nonfree package
2008-08-26T12:30:00.000Z	ikonia	gaurav__	remove gnash, use flashpluging-nonfree
2008-08-26T12:30:00.000Z	ikonia	gaurav__	what is your native language
2008-08-26T12:31:00.000Z	ikonia	gaurav__	have you considered getting help from the native Indian channels as I think your not understanding what's being said to you very well
2008-08-26T12:32:00.000Z	ikonia	gaurav__	it doesn't look like your understanding very well, hence why I'm suggesting a native Indian channel to you
