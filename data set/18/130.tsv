2012-08-19T11:48:00.000Z	Moonlightning		Internal error? Oh, there's an option to submit a report. I'll do that…
2012-08-19T11:48:00.000Z	Moonlightning		Precise is no longer under development. Huh? Oh, there's a convenient “I don't know what to do” option.
2012-08-19T11:49:00.000Z	Moonlightning		Link to a website…
2012-08-19T11:49:00.000Z	Moonlightning		Hmm.
2012-08-19T11:49:00.000Z	Moonlightning		Why doesn't it just submit a bug report like OS X does? 6_9
2012-08-19T11:50:00.000Z	Moonlightning		I don't really want to go to a website and follow through a bunch of stuff…
2012-08-19T11:52:00.000Z	Moonlightning		Anyway, I have a few problems here still.
2012-08-19T11:52:00.000Z	Moonlightning		1. display is borked. Not sure how to describe it, but the /entire/ thing looks like the wallpaper in http://cl.ly/IqDo .
2012-08-19T11:53:00.000Z	Moonlightning		2. I'm always typing `Linux nomodeset` at the yaboot prompt, and I'd like to know how to automate that.
2012-08-19T11:54:00.000Z	Moonlightning		3. The system beep in tty's is /really/ loud, and I'd like to turn its volume down.
2012-08-19T11:55:00.000Z	xangua	Moonlightning	 instead of typing it everytime you boot wy don't set it at grub¿
2012-08-19T11:55:00.000Z	Moonlightning	xangua	I have yaboot, not grub
2012-08-19T11:56:00.000Z	Moonlightning	xangua	that thread isn't helpful; I don't have grub
2012-08-23T23:10:00.000Z	xangua	Moonlightning	install Myunity to change font settings
2012-08-23T23:12:00.000Z	Moonlightning	xangua	okay, installed `myunity`…now what?
2012-08-23T23:13:00.000Z	xangua	Moonlightning	open it ans go to the Fonts tab
2012-08-23T23:13:00.000Z	Moonlightning	xangua	can I do this via the command line? I have a display problem and it's hard to see anything in the GUI.
2012-08-23T23:18:00.000Z	Moonlightning	xangua	unexpected error from trying to launch myunity…
