2008-06-05T16:09:00.000Z	Kira		How do I find out what kernel version I am using?
2008-06-05T16:11:00.000Z	soundray	Kira	you may have only just installed this and not rebooted since.
2008-06-05T16:13:00.000Z	Kira	soundray	ya, that's probably it.
2008-06-05T16:14:00.000Z	soundray	Kira	do a 'grep title /boot/grub/menu.lst' to see which kernel comes out at the top (and thus will be booted at the next system start)
2008-06-05T16:14:00.000Z	Kira	soundray	heh ok, so the latest is the default now
2008-09-06T22:22:00.000Z	soundray	Kira	why?
2008-09-06T22:23:00.000Z	soundray	Kira	server has no GUI. I think you made the right choice
2008-09-06T22:24:00.000Z	soundray	Kira	try logging in in failsafe (not failsafe gnome) and see if the memory savings allow you to do your processing
2008-09-06T22:24:00.000Z	soundray	Kira	swap is still setup per default, but it's very slow
2008-09-06T22:27:00.000Z	soundray	Kira	what about failsafe?
2008-09-06T22:28:00.000Z	soundray	Kira	it's a session option that you can choose at login
2008-09-06T22:29:00.000Z	soundray	Kira	the simplest way to run a minimal session for trying out a single program, with no gnome hogging your RAM
2008-09-06T22:40:00.000Z	soundray	Kira	have you tried the failsafe session?
2008-09-06T22:42:00.000Z	Kira	soundray	I'm still reading up on failsafe. It's the first time I hear about it.
2008-09-06T22:47:00.000Z	Kira	soundray	how to I initiate a remote failsafe session (say I'm using FreeNX and NX Client).
2008-09-06T22:48:00.000Z	soundray	Kira	sorry, don't know. Do you get a gdm login screen via FreeNX? If so, it's just a matter of clicking Options in the lower left corner and selecting Sessions.
2008-09-06T22:52:00.000Z	Kira	soundray	no. I don't get the login screen with FreeNX (at least I don't know of a way so far); I have to input my username and password before making the connection
2008-09-06T22:56:00.000Z	soundray	Kira	'w' or 'who'
