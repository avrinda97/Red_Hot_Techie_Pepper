2010-06-21T06:52:00.000Z	PDG1		heyhey... trying to get the webGUI working on my crunchbang box and I keep getting a 403 error. any thoughts?
2010-06-21T06:53:00.000Z	PDG1		sorry... with Transmission
2010-06-21T06:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	PDG1	 crunch bang is not even based on ubuntu any more last i checked..
2010-06-21T06:53:00.000Z	PDG1	Dr_Willis	whaaat? really?
2010-06-21T06:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	PDG1	 and in any case its not an 'offically supported here' ubuntu variant - even if it was still based on ubuntu.
2010-06-21T06:54:00.000Z	PDG1	Dr_Willis	install was exactly like the Ubuntu install
2010-06-21T06:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	PDG1	 check crunchbang homepage. Im pretty suire they switched to  Debian
2010-06-21T06:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	PDG1	 could be you are on an older version.
2010-06-21T06:55:00.000Z	PDG1	Dr_Willis	maybe... any idea why transmission might do that tho? I did just install apache, think that has something to do with it?
2010-06-21T06:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	PDG1	 as far as i know those apps dont  require apache to have a web interface.. im using the latest 'transmission 2.00' version from a PPA also.. so its hard to telll
2010-06-21T06:57:00.000Z	PDG1	Dr_Willis	yeah...I was trying to get fluxtorrent-b4rt to work and I got tired of looking at outdated tutorials and decided i was going to revert to tried and true transmission. now it's not working :(
2010-06-21T06:58:00.000Z	PDG1	Dr_Willis	and #! ships with rtorrent which is good... if i could remember how to use it.
2010-06-21T06:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	PDG1	 takes me all of 20 sec to install rtorrent on ubuntu.. i dont see much need for #! basically
2010-06-21T06:59:00.000Z	PDG1	Dr_Willis	i liked how it felt like Ubuntu and the small resource hunger
2010-06-21T07:01:00.000Z	PDG1	Dr_Willis	do you have any suggestions for a small distro i could use instead that is easy to set up SMB ?
2010-06-21T07:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	PDG1	 samba is rather easy to set up on most any disrto.
2010-06-21T07:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	PDG1	 for small 'footprint' theres xubuntu and lubuntu .
2010-06-21T07:05:00.000Z	PDG1	Dr_Willis	would you believe that i tried both of those and didn't like them much. but it might be because i tried 9.04... should i try an earlier one?
