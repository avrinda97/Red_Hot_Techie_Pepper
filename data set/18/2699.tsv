2010-03-22T00:55:00.000Z	AbortD	vicsar	i was just thinking i dont know if it would be a good idea blacklisting it since it changed my xorg.conf
2010-03-22T00:58:00.000Z	vicsar	AbortD	no feedback on that one, my knowledge does not go that far. Anyone else?
2010-03-22T01:02:00.000Z	vicsar	AbortD	since you don want to blacklist the driver then maybe this other post works: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=517225

2010-03-22T01:05:00.000Z	AbortD	vicsar	how you find that
2010-03-22T01:09:00.000Z	vicsar	AbortD	google and read a bit. I did three searches: ubuntu remove driver, ubuntu remove ati 10.2 driver, and finally ubuntu installing ati drivers
2010-03-22T01:09:00.000Z	vicsar		the last search took me to the last page i gave you
2010-03-22T01:09:00.000Z	AbortD	vicsar	oh i tried the first 2
2010-03-22T01:10:00.000Z	vicsar	AbortD	yeah, takes a while... oops typo last search was ubuntu remove ati 10.2 driver
