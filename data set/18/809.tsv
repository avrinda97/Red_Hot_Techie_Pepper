2012-11-17T12:45:00.000Z	rymate1234		I'm trying to use gparted to resize my partitions
2012-11-17T12:45:00.000Z	rymate1234		I have this error http://pastebin.com/wYu9xYn6
2012-11-17T12:46:00.000Z	rymate1234		Here's some potentially useful terminal output http://pastebin.com/aucr3VkM
2012-11-17T12:46:00.000Z	ix_	rymate1234	what are you trying to do?
2012-11-17T12:48:00.000Z	ix_	rymate1234	you can't, just make partitions there
2012-11-17T12:49:00.000Z	ix_	rymate1234	you could delete sda5 and make it bigger
2012-11-17T12:50:00.000Z	ix_	rymate1234	:) well, dude, you've made your partitions pretty badly
2012-11-17T12:51:00.000Z	ix_	rymate1234	well, I always have 3 partitions, one for Linux, one for all my data and one for installing another OS in case of need
2012-11-17T12:51:00.000Z	ix_	rymate1234	I don't think that is a problem
2012-11-17T12:54:00.000Z	ix_	rymate1234	if I were you, I'd delete everything after sda3 and make 2 partitions, one for ubuntu, one for data
2012-11-17T12:55:00.000Z	ix_	rymate1234	you seem to have some space on sda3
2012-11-17T12:56:00.000Z	ix_	rymate1234	you know you could use one partition for data from linux and windows
2012-11-17T12:57:00.000Z	rymate1234	ix_	can't compile android on ntfs
2012-11-17T12:58:00.000Z	ix_	rymate1234	windows can see ext3, with a program, ext2fs I think it's called
2012-11-17T12:59:00.000Z	rymate1234	ix_	tried that before
2012-11-17T13:11:00.000Z	ix_	rymate1234	so, if you delete everything after sda3, you should make one big extended partition there in which you can put whatever partitions you want
2012-11-17T13:11:00.000Z	rymate1234	ix_	will do
