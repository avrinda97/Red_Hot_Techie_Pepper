2008-12-24T17:49:00.000Z	Vinceman		does anybody know anything about the sound recorder?
2008-12-24T17:50:00.000Z	Vinceman		When you use the sound recorder, how do you know that input 'capture' is good enough? My sound is not recorded strongly enough.. :(
2008-12-24T17:51:00.000Z	Vinceman		nobody records sound? that's impossible
2008-12-24T17:51:00.000Z	Vinceman		there are over 1200 people here!
2008-12-24T17:51:00.000Z	moza	Vinceman	i use audacity to record sound
2008-12-24T17:51:00.000Z	Vinceman	moza	so the standard sound recorder is no good then?
2008-12-24T17:52:00.000Z	moza		and i adjust the capture volume so that it is high enough AND not too high to make noise
2008-12-24T17:52:00.000Z	moza	Vinceman	i don't know what is the standard sound recorder
2008-12-24T17:52:00.000Z	moza		and if i need another adjustment on the capture, i use alsamixer
2008-12-24T17:53:00.000Z	Vinceman		gnome-sound-recorder 2.24.0.1
2008-12-24T17:55:00.000Z	Vinceman		where's this sound icon?
2008-12-24T17:55:00.000Z	Vinceman		filthpig?
2008-12-24T17:56:00.000Z	moza	Vinceman	probably at the bottom right of your screen if you didn't move the toolbars
2008-12-24T18:02:00.000Z	Vinceman	moza	the extra options are in open volume control but not in the sound recorder
2008-12-24T18:03:00.000Z	moza	Vinceman	then modify them in the volume control, it may help
2008-12-24T18:03:00.000Z	Vinceman		I tried, the recording volume is still very low
2008-12-24T18:03:00.000Z	moza		(i'm definitely not an expert in sound
2008-12-24T19:02:00.000Z	Vinceman	moza	what's are the differences between lossy and lossless sound recording?
