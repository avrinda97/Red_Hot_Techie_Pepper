2007-11-07T19:41:00.000Z	erUSUL	neil_d	timezone is simbolic link
2007-11-07T19:42:00.000Z	erUSUL	neil_d	forget what i said... back to check docs
2009-02-20T20:07:00.000Z	neil_d	erUSUL	the website says its in debian experimental, so it going to happen sometime.
2010-01-30T17:38:00.000Z	erUSUL	neil_d	maybe you neeed to load the qemu driver
2010-01-30T17:38:00.000Z	erUSUL	neil_d	run --> find /lib/modules -name '*qemu*'
2010-01-30T17:39:00.000Z	neil_d	erUSUL	no results...
2010-01-30T17:42:00.000Z	erUSUL	neil_d	https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/qemu-kvm/+bug/424765
2010-01-30T17:42:00.000Z	erUSUL	neil_d	no kqemu anymore
2010-01-30T17:46:00.000Z	neil_d	erUSUL	if there is no /dev/kqemu how do I get qemu to work at full speed?  it is very slow.
2010-01-30T17:47:00.000Z	erUSUL	neil_d	as the bug report says there is no kqemu in karmic... maybe your cpu supports kvm. if it is the case switch to kvm
2010-01-30T17:47:00.000Z	neil_d	erUSUL	I will try.
2010-01-31T05:58:00.000Z	neil_d	erUSUL	just thinking.. as it is a script... you might even be able to use a python or perl script as well..
2010-08-19T17:23:00.000Z	erUSUL	neil_d	someone reordered the drives in bios and the hd containing the grub mbr is not the first in the boot sequence ?
2010-08-19T17:23:00.000Z	erUSUL	neil_d	s/someone/something/
2010-08-19T17:25:00.000Z	neil_d	erUSUL	ok I don't see how, but I will reorder the drives.. (it this computer) ... so bye for now.
2010-11-03T19:21:00.000Z	erUSUL	neil_d	you did not get any error either?
2010-11-03T19:22:00.000Z	neil_d	erUSUL	not that I saw.. everything looked fine.
2010-11-03T19:23:00.000Z	erUSUL	neil_d	then i dunno; hard to know when it fails silently
