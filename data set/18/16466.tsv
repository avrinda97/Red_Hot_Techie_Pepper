2005-09-18T14:59:00.000Z	MrSmile		Hi people!
2005-09-18T15:00:00.000Z	MrSmile		I am a newbie.
2005-09-18T15:00:00.000Z	MrSmile		I want to know what might be the difference from ubuntu and debian... My sister needs a linux system and I don't know what to install.
2005-09-18T15:01:00.000Z	MrSmile		In howfar?! Has it a graphical installation program?!
2005-09-18T15:01:00.000Z	MrSmile		And what about the latest packages?!
2005-09-18T15:02:00.000Z	MrSmile		I will, i will....
2005-09-18T15:02:00.000Z	MrSmile		:)
2005-09-18T15:03:00.000Z	MrSmile		for me gentoo as a developer is the overkill and I am very satisfied. But I don't like to install gentoo on a user machine.
2005-09-18T15:03:00.000Z	MrSmile		not true (but everybody has a different opinion)
