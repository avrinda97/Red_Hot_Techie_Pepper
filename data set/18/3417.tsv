2009-12-21T13:38:00.000Z	Riddick		anyone have any idea why ubuntu would hang at 33% formatting a drive every time during install? or some workaround that would get it moving forward?
2009-12-21T13:38:00.000Z	Riddick		and this is a brand new drive.  i thought one i was installing on may have been bad.  got a new drive and save issue.
2009-12-21T13:40:00.000Z	FireCrotch	Riddick	How long have you left it sit at 33%?
2009-12-21T13:41:00.000Z	Riddick	FireCrotch	i have tried leaving it for a while.  right now i think its been sitting there the last few hours.  its just hung.  the mouse wont move, etc.  its froze.
2009-12-21T13:42:00.000Z	FireCrotch	Riddick	It *could* be a memory issue
2009-12-21T13:43:00.000Z	Riddick	FireCrotch	not memory   tests fine and will run windows with no issues whatsoever
2009-12-21T13:44:00.000Z	FireCrotch	Riddick	hard drive cable?
2009-12-21T13:44:00.000Z	Riddick	FireCrotch	got a new one with the new drive.  so i would say no.
2009-12-21T13:45:00.000Z	FireCrotch	Riddick	Have you ever previously installed Ubuntu on this same computer?
2009-12-21T13:46:00.000Z	Riddick	FireCrotch	no, i have tried and failed over and over.
2009-12-21T13:46:00.000Z	FireCrotch	Riddick	Maybe Ubuntu doesn't like your motherboard's SATA or IDE controller
2009-12-21T13:48:00.000Z	FireCrotch	Riddick	what does lspci | grep SATA  give you for the model of your SATA controller?
2009-12-21T13:48:00.000Z	Riddick	FireCrotch	i have never got it to recognize sata  it will start the install from the sata blueray but then fail to continue when you say install  so i have used a usb dvd drive to do the install and put an ide harddrive in which it does see
2009-12-21T13:49:00.000Z	FireCrotch	Riddick	Oh, yeah, you definitely need a new mobo then :P
2009-12-21T13:50:00.000Z	Riddick	FireCrotch	what do you think of this board?  http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=4408209&sku=A455-2876
2009-12-21T13:53:00.000Z	FireCrotch	Riddick	seems to be your average run of the mill AM3 motherboard, really
2009-12-21T13:55:00.000Z	FireCrotch	Riddick	How old is the motherboard that you're trying to use?
2009-12-21T13:57:00.000Z	FireCrotch	Riddick	it seems to me that it may not necessarily be that Ubuntu doesn't like your chipset, but rather that it's going bad (you might not have problems with Windows even if the chipset is crapping out)
