2009-12-28T21:45:00.000Z	gM		my usb drive used to be working fine, automounted and could browse the files, suddenly it stopped working the regular way, I am not able to mount manually either.

2009-12-28T21:49:00.000Z	gM		but I ddnt notice any sdb# in /dev
2009-12-28T21:50:00.000Z	gM		there is no /dev/sdb#
2009-12-28T21:51:00.000Z	gM		gparted did not recognise sdb altogether.
2009-12-28T21:51:00.000Z	mka	gM	if you have sdb and no sdb? then your usb drive does not have any filesystem
2009-12-28T21:51:00.000Z	mka	gM	what is the output of "sudo fdisk -l" ?
2009-12-28T21:54:00.000Z	gM	mka	- I have filesystem and was working fine. Suddenly I lost it. may be corrupted?
2009-12-28T21:56:00.000Z	mka	gM	sudo fdisk -l should always list your usb unless it is physically damaged or the port you connect to went bad
2009-12-28T21:59:00.000Z	mka	gM	can you use it now?
2009-12-28T22:01:00.000Z	mka	gM	but sudo fdisk -l cannot show any traces of your usb disk, that concerns me
2009-12-28T22:01:00.000Z	gM	mka	correct, neither gparted
2009-12-28T22:02:00.000Z	gM	mka	but nautilus show it in the panel. saying 'Generic USB Flash Disk'.
2009-12-28T22:02:00.000Z	mka	gM	I am not concered with gparted
2009-12-28T22:03:00.000Z	mka	gM	can you please pastebin the output of sudo fdisk -l ? How much is the disk space of your usb disk?
