2011-05-09T17:31:00.000Z	pythonirc101		I want to setup LTS on a vbox so that I can shrink and enlarge the hard drive space. How can I do this? Install LVM?
2011-05-09T17:32:00.000Z	pythonirc101		or just use complete hard drive while installation?
2011-05-09T17:33:00.000Z	pythonirc101		32GB is currently
2011-05-09T17:33:00.000Z	pythonirc101		but  i want the virtualbox guest ubuntu to be able to expand it later if need be
2011-05-09T17:34:00.000Z	pythonirc101		I have Vbox on win 7 host. I'm installing ubuntu as a guest
2011-05-09T17:34:00.000Z	zvacet	pythonirc101	yyou have that by default during installation of Ubuntu in vbox give 10gb and select dinamicly expand
2011-05-09T17:37:00.000Z	pythonirc101	zvacet	I clicked on LVM while installation and it gave me some defaults, just used them
2011-05-09T17:37:00.000Z	pythonirc101		how can i change my paritition to dynamically expandable?
2011-05-09T17:38:00.000Z	pythonirc101		in ubuntu
2011-05-09T17:39:00.000Z	pythonirc101		in vbox i've it selected as dynamacially expandable
2011-05-09T17:39:00.000Z	pythonirc101		but in ubuntu, how do i expand it when i expand it in vbox
2011-05-09T17:39:00.000Z	zvacet	pythonirc101	I think it is question after you dedicate space for guest you can choose will it stay like that or will it expand if neccessery
2011-05-09T17:40:00.000Z	zvacet	pythonirc101	that one
2011-05-09T17:40:00.000Z	pythonirc101		k, its installing the guest ubuntu now...
2011-05-09T17:41:00.000Z	zvacet	pythonirc101	you will not expand Ubuntu vbox will do it for you if it need more space
2011-05-09T17:41:00.000Z	pythonirc101		interesting
2011-05-09T17:43:00.000Z	zvacet	pythonirc101	it is virtual disc on your HD and vbox control it so it can be expandable if need more space then you give to virtual disc
