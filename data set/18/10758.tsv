2008-03-27T07:55:00.000Z	xenis69		hey all
2008-03-27T07:55:00.000Z	xenis69		can some one help me with a dhcp server question
2008-03-27T07:56:00.000Z	Svenstaro	xenis69	sure what is it?
2008-03-27T07:56:00.000Z	Svenstaro	xenis69	255.255.255.0 will work for you as a subnet
2008-03-27T07:58:00.000Z	Svenstaro	xenis69	you need to tell it to listen on eth1 too :)
2008-03-27T08:00:00.000Z	Svenstaro	xenis69	put this into your dhcpd.conf "INTERFACES="eth1"" without the wrapper quotes
2008-03-27T08:00:00.000Z	Svenstaro	xenis69	should do the job
2008-03-27T08:00:00.000Z	Svenstaro	xenis69	of course restart it afterwards
2008-03-27T08:07:00.000Z	Svenstaro	xenis69	you might wanna try out "gdhcpd" its a neat little dhcpd configurator
2008-03-27T08:13:00.000Z	Svenstaro	xenis69	you need command line? then do sudo dpkg-recondigure dhcp3-server
2008-03-27T08:14:00.000Z	Svenstaro	xenis69	I suck i spelled it wrong, sudo dpkg-reconfigure dhcp3-server
2008-03-27T08:15:00.000Z	Svenstaro	xenis69	sure am :)
2008-03-27T08:19:00.000Z	Svenstaro	xenis69	no, the dhcp package refers to an older version, of course use YOUR package version in dpkg-reconfigure
2008-03-27T08:20:00.000Z	Svenstaro	xenis69	not at all, tho I recommend the newer version of dhcp
2008-03-27T08:22:00.000Z	Svenstaro	xenis69	I recommend you install dhcp3-server instead of dhcp-server, it will give you less trouble
2008-03-27T08:24:00.000Z	Svenstaro	xenis69	the changes will be permanent
2008-03-27T08:29:00.000Z	Svenstaro	xenis69	please know that advertising for stuff you want to sell should rather be done outside this channel
