2008-01-10T00:14:00.000Z	zhegao		i can access the internet but i cannot add any applications on ubuntu, what seems to be the problem?
2008-01-10T00:15:00.000Z	Slart	zhegao	can you use synaptic?
2008-01-10T00:15:00.000Z	zhegao	Slart	i have no idea how to use synaptic, i'm very new to ubuntu
2008-01-10T00:17:00.000Z	Slart	zhegao	synaptic is another way of installing things.. in ubuntu you can install software by using the Add/Remove-menu, by using synaptic, or by using the command line with apt-get.. there are others too but these are the most common ones.. in the menu "system, administration, synaptic package manager"
2008-01-10T00:18:00.000Z	zhegao	Slart	yeah I have it opened but now what?
2008-01-10T00:18:00.000Z	Slart	zhegao	what program did you want to install?
2008-01-10T00:19:00.000Z	Slart	zhegao	press the search button.. type in "wireless assistant" and ok
2008-01-10T00:20:00.000Z	zhegao	Slart	nothing shows up
2008-01-10T00:21:00.000Z	Slart	zhegao	hmm... what's odd.. if you search for say.. "linux" do you still get 0 hits?
2008-01-10T00:22:00.000Z	zhegao	Slart	i get a lot of results for linux
2008-01-10T00:22:00.000Z	Slart	zhegao	ok.. in the settings menu in synaptic, press "repositories"
2008-01-10T00:22:00.000Z	zhegao	Slart	the main goal im getting at is wireless connectivity, should i be downloading ndviswrapper instead?
2008-01-10T00:23:00.000Z	Slart	zhegao	I'm not sure.. I don't run wireless myself.. but we'll find your wireless assistant package, don't worry
2008-01-10T00:23:00.000Z	zhegao	Slart	ok, so i'm at the repository
2008-01-10T00:24:00.000Z	Slart	zhegao	you can enable all the different repositories there.. make sure there is a checkmark before each one of them..
2008-01-10T00:24:00.000Z	zhegao	Slart	ok, i did all that
2008-01-10T00:25:00.000Z	Slart	zhegao	press close.. you might get a dialog window that says it needs to update the list.. do that
2008-01-10T02:06:00.000Z	Slart	zhegao	you're welcome
