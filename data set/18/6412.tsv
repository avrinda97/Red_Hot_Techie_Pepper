2008-06-17T23:23:00.000Z	chazco		Hmm... ch0wda - I've been having issues too... i'm starting to suspect the repos (dabaR and EvilDennisR may also read this)
2008-06-17T23:24:00.000Z	chazco		Mine has been downloading, but everything seems totally wrong
2008-06-17T23:26:00.000Z	chazco		Yep
2008-06-17T23:26:00.000Z	chazco		I'm giving up on Ubuntu for now... three days trying to run a simple update is stupidly bad
2008-06-17T23:27:00.000Z	chazco		Everything to do with apt and dpkg seems to give the same errors... ive just had enough now
2008-06-17T23:27:00.000Z	chazco		A fresh install doesnt even fix the issues... something is broke and its not these computers... its got to be the repos or the link between them and me
2008-06-17T23:29:00.000Z	chazco		Will there be an updated Hardy disc at some point with all the updates preinstalled?
2008-06-17T23:29:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	chazco	probably not
2008-06-17T23:29:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	chazco	or
2008-06-17T23:30:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	chazco	which Firefox do you want to run?
2008-06-17T23:30:00.000Z	chazco	SebNaitsabes	- Firefox isnt the issue, its all the updates... i cannot perform updates after a fresh install on any machine... i dont know why
2008-06-17T23:30:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	chazco	well you could run the latest Windows version of Firefox, but that's a bit stupid
2008-06-17T23:31:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	chazco	make sure proposed updates is on in the package maanger
2008-08-25T02:26:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	chazco	AOL sucks
2008-08-25T02:26:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	chazco	 but that's not a very helfpul answer and so
2008-08-25T02:26:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	chazco	AOL is for Windows
2008-08-25T02:26:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	chazco	you probably connect on Windows with some sort of AOL software yes?
2008-08-25T02:27:00.000Z	chazco	SebNaitsabes	- Nope, the Windows machines have never touched an AOL CD and work fine
