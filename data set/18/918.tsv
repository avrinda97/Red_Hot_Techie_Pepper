2011-10-26T19:26:00.000Z	nemo	auronandace	I have av on my machine at work because there is a policy to have av on all machines :)
2011-10-26T19:27:00.000Z	nemo	auronandace	it is basically a waste of CPU whenever it runs a sweep, but, eh, whatever.
2011-10-26T19:27:00.000Z	auronandace	nemo	eh, i hate red tape too
2012-04-15T22:15:00.000Z	auronandace	nemo	do you have a screenshot?
2012-04-15T22:16:00.000Z	nemo	auronandace	it wasn't the hinting, was the antialiasing
2012-04-15T22:16:00.000Z	nemo	auronandace	wrong terminology I guess
2012-04-15T22:49:00.000Z	nemo	auronandace	found the real fix
2012-04-15T22:49:00.000Z	nemo	auronandace	and like most things since gnome2 was killed off, it is annoyingly convoluted :)
2012-04-15T22:50:00.000Z	nemo	auronandace	if you want subpixel AA it isn't just a dropdown in display settings
2012-04-15T22:50:00.000Z	auronandace	nemo	awesome, do tell
2012-04-15T22:50:00.000Z	nemo	auronandace	you have to fire up dconf-editor and go and set the pixel order there if you aren't lucky enough to already be on rgb
2012-04-15T22:50:00.000Z	nemo	auronandace	once I did that (and I wasn't sure of pixel order, I just kept changing them until it stopped looking muddy)
2012-04-15T22:51:00.000Z	auronandace	nemo	wow, convoluted was the right word
2012-04-15T22:51:00.000Z	nemo	auronandace	 /org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/xsettings/rgba-order dropdown FWIW
2012-04-15T22:52:00.000Z	auronandace	nemo	well done
2012-04-15T22:53:00.000Z	nemo	auronandace	but. yeah. annoying. that used to be a nice friendly menu in config settings :(
2012-04-15T22:54:00.000Z	auronandace	nemo	i'll be trying out unity when 12.04 releases, i bet there will be problems
