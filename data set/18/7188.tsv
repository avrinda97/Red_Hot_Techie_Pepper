2008-12-02T01:57:00.000Z	rww	adrenaline	do that on linux-image
2008-12-02T02:00:00.000Z	adrenaline	rww	hey it is all greyed out for me
2008-12-02T02:00:00.000Z	rww	adrenaline	what is?
2008-12-02T02:01:00.000Z	rww	adrenaline	oh, I made a mistake anyway. You'd want to lock the linux-image package you're using (so e.g. linux-image-2.6.27-9-generic for me)
2008-12-02T02:01:00.000Z	adrenaline	rww	also linux images is not checked
2008-12-02T02:02:00.000Z	rww	adrenaline	the "lock version" option is greyed out?
2008-12-02T02:02:00.000Z	adrenaline	rww	yes
2008-12-02T02:02:00.000Z	rww	adrenaline	that's odd. Try the Apt/Dpkg way on the site instead, then
2008-12-02T02:03:00.000Z	rww	adrenaline	:)
2008-12-02T02:04:00.000Z	rww	adrenaline	pretty sure it won't. The "Lock Version" option tells apt never to update that package, and I'd assume that update-manager is smart enough to notice that
2008-12-02T02:04:00.000Z	rww	adrenaline	you might also want to do the same with linux-image-generic if you have it installed. Ditto linux-image. That'll make doubly-sure.
2008-12-02T02:05:00.000Z	rww	adrenaline	nope, mine are unlocked. I just know how to do it
2008-12-02T02:06:00.000Z	rww	adrenaline	I don't have any problematic hardware (possibly because it all uses free drivers), so I don't need to lock my kernel to a working version
2008-12-02T02:06:00.000Z	adrenaline	rww	I don't either just a work lappy and don't want any probs to arrive
2008-12-02T02:07:00.000Z	rww	adrenaline	You're welcome :)
2008-12-02T21:31:00.000Z	rww	adrenaline	Did you figure out your screensaver problem yet? If not, open up your home folder, press Ctrl-H to show hiden files/folders, go to the .config folder and open user-dirs.dirs (it's a text file). Is XDG_PICTURES_DIR set to the right folder?
