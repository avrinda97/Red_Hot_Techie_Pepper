2007-03-23T16:39:00.000Z	billy		what's the name of that "post-it note" like applet?
2007-03-23T05:41:00.000Z	billy		could i backup my system by copying it to another partition.  like, mount the other partition and then cp to the mount point?
2007-03-23T05:42:00.000Z	dystopianray	billy	I think using tar would be preferable, and be sure to preserve permissions
2007-03-23T05:42:00.000Z	billy	dystopianray	 great idea.  thanks for the tip.
2007-03-23T05:52:00.000Z	billy	dystopianray	 for the backup, create a tar.gz better, you think?  easier to transfer?
2007-03-23T05:52:00.000Z	dystopianray	billy	hrrm, how much data?
2007-03-23T05:52:00.000Z	billy	dystopianray	well, it's the entire shabangabang.  5Gig, about.
2007-03-23T05:53:00.000Z	dystopianray	billy	ah, well 5GB is not that much, gzip might allow it to fit on a dvd, which could be handy
2007-03-23T05:53:00.000Z	billy	dystopianray	 gzip?  what about -z flag into tar?
2007-03-23T05:54:00.000Z	dystopianray	billy	yes, the -z flag makes it gzip the tar file, hence .tar.gz
2007-03-23T05:54:00.000Z	billy	dystopianray	ok.  so long as it's the same sort of deal.  :-)
2007-03-23T05:54:00.000Z	dystopianray	billy	the -j flag will use bzip2 instead, might end up smaller, but will take considerably longer to compress
2007-03-23T05:55:00.000Z	billy	dystopianray	thanks for the tip.
2007-03-23T08:38:00.000Z	billy	dystopianray	isn't it already there?
2007-03-23T08:38:00.000Z	billy	dystopianray	http://ubuntu.beryl-project.org/
2007-03-23T08:38:00.000Z	dystopianray	billy	no it's not
2007-03-23T08:38:00.000Z	dystopianray	billy	not in official repos i mean
2007-03-23T08:38:00.000Z	billy	dystopianray	oh.  i see.
