2007-07-27T14:23:00.000Z	blackjackel		Well I know my ubuntu install is there, i just want to make it boot to it... how do i do that?
2007-07-27T14:24:00.000Z	SpeakerMania	blackjackel	change the boot sequence in your BIOS unless you have it on the same hard drive as another OS
2007-07-27T14:24:00.000Z	blackjackel	SpeakerMania	Boot sequence? You mean change which drive it checks the bootloader for?
2007-07-27T14:25:00.000Z	blackjackel	SpeakerMania	Ah, and then I can change the other bootloader to boot to the first drive (windows).... right?
2007-07-27T14:25:00.000Z	SpeakerMania	blackjackel	Yes. I grew up with Windows.
2007-07-27T14:25:00.000Z	blackjackel	SpeakerMania	So did I :)
2007-07-27T14:25:00.000Z	blackjackel	SpeakerMania	But Ive always preferred 2000 over XP...
2007-07-27T14:25:00.000Z	SpeakerMania	blackjackel	well then the term "boot sequence" should be familiar
2007-07-27T14:26:00.000Z	blackjackel	SpeakerMania	I grew up with windows, but ive done such geeky stuff with windows that I feel I should have started with linux...
2007-07-27T14:26:00.000Z	SpeakerMania	blackjackel	same here. :)
2007-07-27T14:26:00.000Z	SpeakerMania	blackjackel	same here. Linux is just so much easier and better.
2007-07-27T14:26:00.000Z	blackjackel	SpeakerMania	For example, back when everyone ran 98, I ran the windows 95 shell on 98 just to make it more stable
2007-07-27T14:27:00.000Z	blackjackel	SpeakerMania	well it was, which was how I understood you so quick, I'll try it
2007-07-27T14:27:00.000Z	SpeakerMania	blackjackel	Nice. I was still running 95 when everyone went for 98 and 98SE
2007-07-27T14:28:00.000Z	blackjackel	SpeakerMania	I woulda still ran 95 but games werent compatible with it anymore... you know microsoft
2007-07-27T14:28:00.000Z	SpeakerMania	blackjackel	I am a huge fan of Microsoft, especially since Vista, but I'm not a fan of the huge monopoly they have made.
2007-07-27T14:29:00.000Z	blackjackel	SpeakerMania	you're a fan of microsoft especially since vista? Vista blows chungs
2007-07-27T14:29:00.000Z	SpeakerMania	blackjackel	not with a quad-core processor and running on my rig. ;)
