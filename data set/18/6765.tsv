2010-01-01T23:16:00.000Z	meero	ghostknife	how to run chroot as "this" user?
2010-01-01T23:17:00.000Z	ghostknife	meero	su <user> -c "chroot command"
2010-01-01T23:17:00.000Z	ghostknife	meero	su <user> -c "<command>" # runs <command> as <user>
2010-01-01T23:18:00.000Z	ghostknife	meero	alternatively you can just do: sudo su <user>

2010-01-01T23:21:00.000Z	ghostknife	meero	why do you want this? does rtorrent have a security problem you're trying to protect against?
