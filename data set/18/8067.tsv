2007-10-06T16:23:00.000Z	tetrach		i am a newb and have a few questions is there someone here who could help out in a private chat
2007-10-06T16:24:00.000Z	scguy318	tetrach	asking here is fine
2007-10-06T16:24:00.000Z	scguy318	tetrach	the channel isn't seriously busy
2007-10-06T16:31:00.000Z	scguy318	tetrach	how much memory do you have?
2007-10-06T16:31:00.000Z	scguy318	tetrach	do you want to hibernate/suspend?
2007-10-06T16:31:00.000Z	scguy318	tetrach	probably a little more than 2 GB then
2007-10-06T16:35:00.000Z	scguy318	tetrach	yes
2007-10-06T16:36:00.000Z	scguy318	tetrach	swap size is kinda dependent on RAM, since you probably will be suspending/hibernating to disk
2007-10-06T16:36:00.000Z	scguy318	tetrach	if you dont plan to do that you don't have to have swap at all really
2007-10-06T16:37:00.000Z	scguy318	tetrach	suspending or hibernating your Linux machine
2007-10-06T16:39:00.000Z	scguy318	tetrach	some people don't like to load everything each time they boot, so they suspend, BUT Linux is kinda crappy with suspend, it may or may not work for you
2007-10-06T16:43:00.000Z	scguy318	tetrach	what do you mean?
2007-10-06T16:43:00.000Z	scguy318	tetrach	its very good idea to give the Windows installation its own partition
2007-10-06T16:44:00.000Z	scguy318	tetrach	sure, thats not a problem
2007-10-06T16:45:00.000Z	tetrach	scguy318	tks alot for your help
2007-10-06T07:18:00.000Z	scguy318	tetrach	it means you need to use nspluginwrapper for Flash on x64
