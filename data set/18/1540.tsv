2011-05-01T09:31:00.000Z	ohsix	JoseeAntonioR	xorg.conf still works in 11.04
2011-05-01T09:32:00.000Z	ohsix	JoseeAntonioR	can you restate what you're trying to do for me?
2011-05-01T09:33:00.000Z	JoseeAntonioR	ohsix	I did a hardware test, and it said it was using the Nouveau driver, but I have an Intel chipset, so I want to use the Intel driver.
2011-05-01T09:34:00.000Z	ohsix	JoseeAntonioR	that's really odd, your server is running right now with the nouveau driver?
2011-05-01T09:35:00.000Z	JoseeAntonioR	ohsix	I'm using Ubuntu Desktop.
2011-05-01T09:35:00.000Z	ohsix	JoseeAntonioR	open a terminal and run glxinfo, copy its output to paste.ubuntu.com
2011-05-01T09:36:00.000Z	JoseeAntonioR	ohsix	http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/601605/
2011-05-01T09:40:00.000Z	ohsix	JoseeAntonioR	ok you aren't using nouveau, or the intel driver; where did you read that it was using the nouveau driver?
2011-05-01T09:42:00.000Z	JoseeAntonioR	ohsix	I did System Testing, and in the results it said that I was using nouveau driver.
2011-05-01T09:43:00.000Z	ohsix	JoseeAntonioR	odd, that might be a bug in system testing; theres no visible to the OS nvidia card in there
2011-05-01T09:43:00.000Z	JoseeAntonioR	ohsix	But my general problem is that my monitor isn't detected. I cannot change my resolution, it's stuck in 1024x768
2011-05-01T09:44:00.000Z	ohsix	JoseeAntonioR	i see that theres only software rendering going on, so likely no gpu drivers are being loaded, did you boot with nomodeset or do anything related?
2011-05-01T09:45:00.000Z	JoseeAntonioR	ohsix	I did a normal boot.
2011-05-01T09:45:00.000Z	ohsix	JoseeAntonioR	oh nevermind, thats i810 hw
2011-05-01T09:46:00.000Z	ohsix	JoseeAntonioR	all i've heard about i810 is it not really working for 3d or anything as of the last year or two; i don't know what to say
2011-05-01T10:10:00.000Z	ohsix	JoseeAntonioR	it's not just your monitor; it's not using an accelerated  driver, that may be the only mode
2011-05-01T10:11:00.000Z	ohsix	JoseeAntonioR	you on't get a solution but you might try asking in #intel-gfx what the status of the driver for your hw is
2011-05-01T10:11:00.000Z	JoseeAntonioR	ohsix	Well, thanks!
