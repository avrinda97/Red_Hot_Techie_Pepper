2007-07-06T09:18:00.000Z	banlieue		hey, you people are surely a lot better with ubuntu (gnome) than I am, so.. could anyone tell me how I could make gnome open 'window manager' on press of ctrl+alt+del
2007-07-06T09:19:00.000Z	banlieue		is there any way of adding custom commands to the keyboard shortcuts menu?
2007-07-06T09:20:00.000Z	banlieue		so, to add an universal keyboard shortcut to certain commands..
2007-07-06T09:22:00.000Z	nickrud	banlieue	you mean like putting gnome-terminal on clt-alt-t?
2007-07-06T09:23:00.000Z	banlieue	nickrud	for example, but gnome-terminal would be a bad example as it's available in the 'keyboard shortcuts' menu. I'm hoping to add a custom command ('knotes' for example) to a certain key combination
2007-07-06T09:24:00.000Z	nickrud	banlieue	open gconf-editor, and navigate to apps/metacity , there's two panels: keybinding_commands and global_keybindings. You can add custom ones there
2007-07-06T09:24:00.000Z	nickrud	banlieue	if you need more than 12, just add new keys in each
2007-07-06T10:07:00.000Z	nickrud	banlieue	write a script wrapper
2007-07-06T10:07:00.000Z	banlieue	nickrud	is there a commandline way as well?
2007-07-06T10:07:00.000Z	nickrud	banlieue	specifically?
2007-07-06T10:08:00.000Z	banlieue	nickrud	um, a way to make it work without having to make a file for it?
2007-07-06T10:08:00.000Z	nickrud	banlieue	not that I'm aware of
2007-07-08T08:06:00.000Z	nickrud	banlieue	proper?
2007-07-08T08:06:00.000Z	banlieue	nickrud	proper as in good looking
2007-07-08T08:06:00.000Z	banlieue	nickrud	the ubuntu icon is boring, i'm hoping to replace it with something fancier
2007-07-08T08:06:00.000Z	nickrud	banlieue	ah, well the debian swirl is nice ;)
2007-07-08T08:06:00.000Z	banlieue	nickrud	where at, though? :)
