2005-09-21T14:56:00.000Z	lenhan	bob2	good point
2005-09-21T14:57:00.000Z	bob2	lenhan	the paralelel thing?
2005-09-21T14:57:00.000Z	bob2	lenhan	that doesn't sound ubuntu-specific at all
2005-09-21T14:57:00.000Z	lenhan	bob2	yes
2005-09-21T14:58:00.000Z	lenhan	bob2	I have the package installed (that's pretty easy), but it looks like ubuntu uses rsh by default instead of ssh
2005-09-21T14:58:00.000Z	bob2	lenhan	rsh poitn at ssh
2005-09-21T14:59:00.000Z	lenhan	bob2	I'm also interested in a more recent version of ubuntu
2005-09-21T14:59:00.000Z	bob2	lenhan	I don't think rsh is in Debian, anywhere
2005-09-21T14:59:00.000Z	bob2	lenhan	breezy is it, but dont' upgrade if you care about nvidia binary drivers
2005-09-21T14:59:00.000Z	lenhan	bob2	yes, rsh is symbolically linked to ssh
2005-09-21T15:00:00.000Z	lenhan	bob2	I'm having problems with it for some reason; I've tried manually compiling it without any success
2005-09-21T15:01:00.000Z	lenhan	bob2	I'm using pvm for work related stuff; I'm using "another solution" for now until I figure how to do it on ubuntu
2005-09-21T15:03:00.000Z	lenhan	bob2	I just wondered if anybody might could give me some hints; I'll figure it out (eventually)
2005-09-21T15:03:00.000Z	bob2	lenhan	irc is a bad place for questions like that; I'd try the pvm list or ubuntu-users
2005-09-21T15:04:00.000Z	lenhan	bob2	thanks
2005-09-21T11:58:00.000Z	lenhan	bob2	hehehe
2005-09-21T11:58:00.000Z	lenhan	bob2	I suppose breezy can't keep your harddrive cool ;-)
