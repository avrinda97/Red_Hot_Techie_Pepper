2008-01-16T05:03:00.000Z	kst-		hi, apparently my windows key is not recognised as Super key but as Mod4 although I bound Super to it in gnome keyboard settings - how do I fix this?
2008-01-16T05:04:00.000Z	sethk	kst-	you can use xmodmap to change it.  There may be an easier way, though.
2008-01-16T05:05:00.000Z	kst-	sethk	hmm :( i'm trying to get gnome-do to work, to recognise any shortcuts but it wont
2008-01-16T05:05:00.000Z	sethk	kst-	xmodmap is a lower level X utility, so it will work with gnome, but using it is more than a bit arcane.
2008-01-16T05:06:00.000Z	kst-	sethk	so is "Super" something you can bind? :)
2008-01-16T05:06:00.000Z	kst-	sethk	or any idea how to reset keyboard settings completely?
2008-01-16T05:06:00.000Z	sethk	kst-	you can bind anything at that level, but as I said, the syntax is odd.
2008-01-16T05:07:00.000Z	sethk	kst-	one thing you can do is, if the mapping is correct at boot, you can use xmodmap to generate a configuration file.  You can then restore that configuration at anytime with xmodmap
2008-01-16T05:07:00.000Z	sethk	kst-	to see what you are dealing with, run the "xev" utility, put the mouse in xev's window, and press various keys.  You'll see how it works
2008-01-16T05:07:00.000Z	sethk	kst-	but it's very low level; you'll see meta up, meta down, that sort of thing
2008-01-16T05:08:00.000Z	sethk	kst-	if you can figure out the syntax, you can quite literally make any key do anything.  I've used it to move the shift lock key location, for example.
2008-01-16T05:08:00.000Z	kst-	sethk	it's the left win key, which is key 115...
2008-01-16T05:08:00.000Z	kst-		yeah sethk i know as once my spacebar was broken so I bound left alt to space while waiting for my new keyboard ;-)
2008-01-16T05:09:00.000Z	sethk	kst-	so you can turn any key into a meta (shift, alt, control, etc.) type key
2008-01-16T05:10:00.000Z	kst-		ok sethk will try :) thanks
2008-01-16T05:10:00.000Z	kst-	sethk	any idea what config file for keyboard i am using atm? so i can have a look at it?
2008-01-16T05:11:00.000Z	sethk	kst-	there is an X utility that will tell you, but I don't remember it off the top of my head.
2008-01-16T05:14:00.000Z	kst-	sethk	can you basically make up names as keycodes and then bind apps to these things?
