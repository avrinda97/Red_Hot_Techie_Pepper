2007-12-20T00:03:00.000Z	RioCunliffe		How can i make a *new* user that is a admin in terminal??
2007-12-20T00:04:00.000Z	genii	RioCunliffe	sudo usermod -G adm <username>
2007-12-20T00:08:00.000Z	genii	RioCunliffe	At any rate, to add an existing user into the admin group (which has sudo rights in the /etc/sudoer file) put what i typed before:   sudo usermod -G adm <theirnamehere>
2007-12-20T00:09:00.000Z	genii	RioCunliffe	There is no need to hand edit files etc etc
2007-12-20T00:26:00.000Z	RioCunliffe	genii	heyy again, you command dosent seem to be working :/
2007-12-20T00:50:00.000Z	genii	RioCunliffe	Then:    usermod -G admin <theirnamehere>
2007-12-20T00:45:00.000Z	genii	RioCunliffe	Didn't we just go through this earlier?
2007-12-20T00:46:00.000Z	RioCunliffe	genii	yes however your command does not seem to be working :/
2007-12-20T00:46:00.000Z	RioCunliffe	genii	it seems to ignore it
2007-12-20T00:47:00.000Z	genii	RioCunliffe	It will add them to the admin group. You need to execute the command as a user that has sudo or admin rights already however
2007-12-20T00:47:00.000Z	RioCunliffe	genii	will it work in recovery?
2007-12-20T00:48:00.000Z	genii	RioCunliffe	Since hd is mounted readonly in recovery, you need to remount it with r/w but yes
2007-12-20T00:48:00.000Z	RioCunliffe	genii	you need to remount it with r/w... How?
2007-12-20T00:49:00.000Z	genii	RioCunliffe	mount -o rw remount /
2007-12-20T00:49:00.000Z	RioCunliffe	genii	thanks ill tryy it
2007-12-20T00:50:00.000Z	genii	RioCunliffe	Since in single user no sudo required
2007-12-20T01:18:00.000Z	RioCunliffe	genii	the command 'mount -o rw remount /' (and variations) didnt work
