2008-07-02T04:35:00.000Z	scudwork		does anyone know if there is a way to make curl use a network proxy by default rather than having to specify each time?
2008-07-02T04:35:00.000Z	zcat[1]	scudwork	export PROXY= I think most software will obey that
2008-07-02T04:36:00.000Z	zcat[1]		ok, now Fujisan is just getting annoying
2008-07-02T04:37:00.000Z	scudwork	zcat[1]	that didn't seem to work
2008-07-02T04:39:00.000Z	zcat[1]	scudwork	might be http_proxy.. I can't recall, but I used it with wget about three days ago..

2008-07-02T04:42:00.000Z	scudwork	zcat[1]	i'm using the environment variables correctly, that's really why i'm confused about it not working
2008-07-02T04:42:00.000Z	zcat[1]		You found a virus that wine will run? That's cool! Wine is getting really compatable with windows now!
2008-07-02T04:42:00.000Z	scudwork	zcat[1]	if I do curl http://ubuntuforums.org -x http://myproxy.com
2008-07-02T04:42:00.000Z	scudwork		it works fine
2008-07-02T04:43:00.000Z	zcat[1]	scudwork	perhaps curl doesn't look at http_proxy :(
2008-07-02T04:44:00.000Z	scudwork	zcat[1]	yeah that may be true, the funny thing is when i configure the proxy through the gnome network proxy gui curl works fine, go figure
2008-07-02T04:44:00.000Z	zcat[1]	scudwork	weird.. open a shell in gnome terminal and see what it might have set for the environment that curl is seeing?
2008-07-02T04:45:00.000Z	zcat[1]		!ntfs-3g
2008-07-02T04:46:00.000Z	zcat[1]		isn't ntfs3g installed by default? that thingy is misleadin?
2008-07-02T04:46:00.000Z	scudwork	zcat[1]	apparently the port needs to specified in the environment variable otherwise curl doesn't know what to do
2008-07-02T04:46:00.000Z	scudwork	zcat[1]	thanks for your help :D
2008-07-02T04:47:00.000Z	zcat[1]	scudwork	well, yes... only some software assumes 3128 ..
