2008-05-14T03:44:00.000Z	RickX		my windows seem to have lost the top bar with the window controls in them. Can anyone tell me how to get them back?
2008-05-14T03:44:00.000Z	makkbe	RickX	are you using compiz?
2008-05-14T03:44:00.000Z	RickX	makkbe	I don't think I am.
2008-05-14T03:45:00.000Z	makkbe	RickX	when the windows decoration dissapears it is usually due to compiz
2008-05-14T03:46:00.000Z	RickX	makkbe	how do I turn it off?
2008-05-14T03:46:00.000Z	makkbe	RickX	preferences --> appearence --> desktop effects
2008-05-14T03:48:00.000Z	RickX	makkbe	there is no button to turn them off, just enable.
2008-05-14T03:48:00.000Z	makkbe	RickX	there should be a "no effects" button or the like
2008-05-14T03:50:00.000Z	makkbe	RickX	hum...
2008-05-14T03:51:00.000Z	makkbe	RickX	metacity --replace
2008-05-14T03:51:00.000Z	RickX	makkbe	metacity is back...
2008-05-14T03:52:00.000Z	makkbe	RickX	try restarting your X server with Ctrl+Alt+Backspace and you will find out
2008-05-14T03:54:00.000Z	RickX	makkbe	no, metacity didn't stay.
2008-05-14T04:01:00.000Z	makkbe	RickX	if you open up cgonf-editor and go to /desktop/gnome/applications/window_manager/default, what does it say?
2008-05-14T04:02:00.000Z	makkbe	RickX	or just execute gconftool --get /desktop/gnome/applications/window_manager/default
2008-05-14T04:05:00.000Z	RickX	makkbe	it says metacity now. I think it change back when I saved my sessions and logged out/back in
2008-05-14T04:07:00.000Z	makkbe	RickX	then the problem is solved?
2008-05-14T04:07:00.000Z	RickX	makkbe	yep... thanks.
