2009-08-17T23:18:00.000Z	og01		anybody know anything about the scripts in etc/acpi?
2009-08-17T23:19:00.000Z	trevorj	og01	yes, what about them
2009-08-17T23:20:00.000Z	og01	trevorj	im trying to get a bit of script to run after a restore from suspend, i added 99-restartnet.sh but it doesnt seem to get run. i added a line; touch /test; but after restore there is no file /test
2009-08-17T23:21:00.000Z	og01	trevorj	i need to rmmod forcedeth; modprobe forcedeth inorder to get my net working again after suspend
2009-08-17T23:22:00.000Z	trevorj	og01	an easier way would be to add that module to the unload list in the suspend configuration
2009-08-17T23:23:00.000Z	og01	trevorj	where can i find such a list :)
2009-08-17T23:23:00.000Z	trevorj	og01	but I had that same problem with /etc/acpi
2009-08-17T23:23:00.000Z	trevorj	og01	I ended up just using /etc/pm/sleep.d/
2009-08-17T23:24:00.000Z	trevorj	og01	like this
2009-08-17T23:24:00.000Z	trevorj	og01	http://pastebin.org/9771
2009-08-17T23:24:00.000Z	trevorj	og01	name it /etc/pm/sleep.d/blah.sh, chmod +x it, and then try
2009-08-17T23:25:00.000Z	trevorj	og01	the thing is, I don't know where the new pm stuff stores it's module reload list
2009-08-17T23:25:00.000Z	trevorj	og01	maybe someone else here does, but I know that the way I just showed you will work
2009-08-17T23:26:00.000Z	og01	trevorj	I'll take a look around, if i cant find it then i'll put a script in pm/sleep.d/
2009-08-17T23:26:00.000Z	og01	trevorj	thanks for your help :)
2009-08-17T23:26:00.000Z	trevorj	og01	np
2009-08-17T23:31:00.000Z	og01	trevorj	just put the script in the sleep.d and it worked a charm
