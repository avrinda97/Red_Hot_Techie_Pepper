2011-01-31T11:07:00.000Z	ChessTeach		When I watch movies in fullscreen the computer logs me out, how do i prevent that from happening when the video is in fullscreen?
2011-01-31T11:09:00.000Z	bastidrazor	ChessTeach	see why its crashing in ~/.xsession-errors
2011-01-31T11:10:00.000Z	ChessTeach	bastidrazor	it isn't crashing, the computer doesn't see any keystrokes and logs me out
2011-01-31T11:10:00.000Z	bastidrazor	ChessTeach	"logs me out" is not normal, something must be crashing.
2011-01-31T11:11:00.000Z	ChessTeach		ok
2011-01-31T11:11:00.000Z	ChessTeach		hold on
2011-01-31T11:11:00.000Z	ChessTeach		(nautilus:6817): GConf-CRITICAL **: gconf_value_free: assertion `value != NULL' failed
2011-01-31T11:11:00.000Z	ChessTeach		i think that is it
2011-01-31T11:13:00.000Z	ChessTeach	bastidrazor	any idea what that means?
2011-01-31T11:15:00.000Z	ChessTeach	bastidrazor	by logging me out, I don't mean it closes my programs down, only locks the screen... i don't know if that was clear
2011-01-31T11:16:00.000Z	bastidrazor	ChessTeach	logging me out was misleading if you meant locks screen.
2011-01-31T11:16:00.000Z	ChessTeach	bastidrazor	i appologize
2011-01-31T11:17:00.000Z	bastidrazor	ChessTeach	you're watching things in flash? flash is buggy to say the least.
2011-01-31T11:18:00.000Z	ChessTeach	bastidrazor	yeah... hulu
2011-01-31T11:19:00.000Z	ChessTeach	bastidrazor	is there anything i can do?
2011-01-31T11:19:00.000Z	bastidrazor		 ChessTeach i do not know how to improve performance.
2011-01-31T11:20:00.000Z	ChessTeach		i guess then i just need to disable auto screen lock?
2011-01-31T11:22:00.000Z	bastidrazor	ChessTeach	that doesn't mean its not possible. give good details of the issue to the channel, someone might know. details mean what applications you're using and exact details to what it breaks/does.
