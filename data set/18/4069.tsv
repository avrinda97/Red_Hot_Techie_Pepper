2009-08-17T06:16:00.000Z	edbian		well "gcalctool" is the actual name
2009-08-17T06:17:00.000Z	jamieleshaw	edbian	You see the other night, I was on here asking how to add percentage with gcalc tool, (I'm used to  windows), Anyway I finally figured it out.
2009-08-17T06:18:00.000Z	edbian	jamieleshaw	O good. :)
2009-08-17T06:18:00.000Z	jamieleshaw	edbian	I asked here because UBUNTU IRC people normally help me, but instead they acted as if i were a moron.
2009-08-17T06:19:00.000Z	edbian	jamieleshaw	No offense but adding percentages isn't exactly ubuntu related.  Even if you are using an ubuntu app.  That's like someone asking for help on a term paper written using Open Office.
2009-08-17T06:20:00.000Z	jamieleshaw	edbian	I know, but you's normally help me anyway.
2009-08-17T06:20:00.000Z	edbian	jamieleshaw	Well I'm flattered.  Do you need help right now? :)
2009-08-17T06:21:00.000Z	jamieleshaw	edbian	Because I really like Ubuntu.
2009-08-17T06:21:00.000Z	edbian	jamieleshaw	Unfortunately I'm in America (Il to be specific) I've never even been to a jambocentral!

2009-08-17T06:22:00.000Z	jamieleshaw	edbian	Sure.
