2005-10-15T11:07:00.000Z	kYotiK	anethema	 what are you compiling?
2005-10-15T11:09:00.000Z	kYotiK	anethema	 what is the driver your installing? what kind of device?
2005-10-15T11:10:00.000Z	kYotiK	anethema	 im not sure about making the deb package
2005-10-15T11:12:00.000Z	kYotiK	anethema	if you can do a locate "filename"    then
2005-10-15T11:12:00.000Z	kYotiK	anethema	 make install,    then the filename that the module uses, use  the locate command to find it \
2005-10-15T11:14:00.000Z	kYotiK	anethema	i guess if its random you will figure that out on your own by learning the hard way lol
2005-10-15T11:17:00.000Z	kYotiK	anethema	sounds like your doing it wrong
2005-10-15T11:17:00.000Z	kYotiK	anethema	  just do a modprobe rlocate
