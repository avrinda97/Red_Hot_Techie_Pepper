2011-08-26T21:32:00.000Z	Soothsayer		Why do new directories and files I copy over to NTFS drives in Ubuntu get corrupt ?
2011-08-26T21:32:00.000Z	Soothsayer		as soon as I come back to windows to access them, they're corrupt
2011-08-26T21:33:00.000Z	rumpe1	Soothsayer	corrupt files or corrupt filenames?
2011-08-26T21:34:00.000Z	Soothsayer	rumpe1	I'm not sure. For example, directories become files with no extensions and appear as Files.
2011-08-26T21:34:00.000Z	rumpe1	Soothsayer	how did you copy them?
2011-08-26T21:35:00.000Z	Soothsayer	rumpe1	through normal copy paste?
2011-08-26T21:35:00.000Z	Soothsayer		from my ubuntu desktop to the mounted ntfs drive.
2011-08-26T21:36:00.000Z	rumpe1	Soothsayer	which ubuntu exactly?
2011-08-26T21:36:00.000Z	Soothsayer	rumpe1	11.04
2011-08-26T21:36:00.000Z	Soothsayer	rumpe1	I recall installing those ntfs utils to make NTFS drives accessible under Ubuntu
2011-08-26T21:36:00.000Z	Soothsayer		I've been facing this problem since day 1.
2011-08-26T21:37:00.000Z	Soothsayer		and its caused me a lot of data loss!
2011-08-26T21:37:00.000Z	Soothsayer		especially, my backups
2011-08-26T21:38:00.000Z	rumpe1	Soothsayer	really strange. Maybe remount and try again.
2011-08-26T21:39:00.000Z	Soothsayer	rumpe1	I've tried too many times.
2011-08-26T21:39:00.000Z	rumpe1	Soothsayer	or try other methods of copy (like via terminal)
2011-08-26T21:39:00.000Z	Soothsayer	rumpe1	this is exactly what I'm facing: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1489573
2011-08-26T21:41:00.000Z	Soothsayer	rumpe1	do you think it's the ntfs packages i downloaded that is causing it ?
