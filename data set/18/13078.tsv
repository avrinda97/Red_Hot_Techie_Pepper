2006-01-15T07:36:00.000Z	userasroot		my install fubared   i can't creat a user that has a /home directory, help me please
2006-01-15T07:36:00.000Z	userasroot		my / and /home are on two different dirs
2006-01-15T07:36:00.000Z	userasroot		rather partitions
2006-01-15T07:36:00.000Z	apokryphos	userasroot	you can't create a user that has a home directory?
2006-01-15T07:37:00.000Z	userasroot	apokryphos	yeah i keep trying to and i can't change the permissions with chmod or chown
2006-01-15T07:38:00.000Z	apokryphos	userasroot	you're going to have to describe the exact situation. / and /home are on different partitions, right. Now, what/why are you trying to chmod/chown anything?
2006-01-15T07:39:00.000Z	userasroot	apokryphos	the installation didn't allow me to create a user  some problem with passwords
2006-01-15T07:39:00.000Z	apokryphos	userasroot	huh? :/
2006-01-15T07:40:00.000Z	apokryphos	userasroot	and now you can't add a new user? Why?
2006-01-15T07:40:00.000Z	apokryphos	userasroot	sudo adduser username
2006-01-15T07:41:00.000Z	userasroot	apokryphos	yeah i can add a user but it won't create a /home/(user)
2006-01-15T07:41:00.000Z	apokryphos	userasroot	it produces no error?
2006-01-15T07:43:00.000Z	apokryphos	userasroot	cat /etc/fstab|grep home    ...gives?
2006-01-15T07:45:00.000Z	apokryphos	userasroot	why is your /home on vfat? :/
2006-01-15T07:46:00.000Z	apokryphos	userasroot	not sure if that's entirely supported. Might well be fine; might not be.
2006-01-15T07:46:00.000Z	apokryphos	userasroot	and the blah blah is important info 8). Always good to paste.
2006-01-15T07:47:00.000Z	apokryphos	userasroot	so why would you want /home as vfat? You can dualboot without that.
2006-01-15T08:01:00.000Z	apokryphos	userasroot	mkfs.ext3 /dev/somepartition
