2007-11-20T03:22:00.000Z	cybersoup		Super Sonic, there should be an option to upgrade in your Update Manager
2007-11-20T03:23:00.000Z	cybersoup		I need some serious help getting my Nvidia driver working, I've installed another card before with no issues.. and this one worked for a couple days... but now it won't
2007-11-20T03:24:00.000Z	cybersoup		I can get the Nvidia driver installed and it seems to work fine, but then whenever I reboot I end up in Failsaife graphics mode
2007-11-20T03:26:00.000Z	cybersoup		if anybody can help me with the Nvidia driver, plz let me know :)
2007-11-20T03:27:00.000Z	cybersoup		adac, i can't use envy because i have no cdrom and it wants to load files from the Ubuntu cd
2007-11-20T03:27:00.000Z	cybersoup		I installed Ubuntu off of a thumbdrive :)
2007-11-20T03:28:00.000Z	adac2	cybersoup	http://albertomilone.com/nvidia_scripts1.html and just klick the download. it shoul install automatically
2007-11-20T03:29:00.000Z	cybersoup	adac2	i've tried it already, it wants to read files off of the ubuntu cd for some reason and i have no cdrom
2007-11-20T03:29:00.000Z	adac2		 cybersoup: i got that error too in the last week... just disable the cdrom over snaptics
2007-11-20T03:30:00.000Z	adac2		*synaptics
2007-11-20T03:30:00.000Z	cybersoup	adac2	ok i'll give that a shot!
2007-11-20T03:32:00.000Z	cybersoup	adac2	Thanks a lot! Envy is installing now.. hopefully this works out
2007-11-20T03:33:00.000Z	adac2		 cybersoup: but be carful. note all packages that will be installed. cause it could crash after installing it
2007-11-20T03:34:00.000Z	adac2	cybersoup	if you note all packages than you are able to remove than afterwards if it fails
2007-11-20T03:34:00.000Z	cybersoup	adac2	okay, thank you for the help
2007-11-20T03:35:00.000Z	adac2	cybersoup	no problem!
2007-11-20T03:35:00.000Z	cybersoup	adac2	I used Envy on my last card and it worked great, so I'm hoping this does too... I wonder if the driver I got from the nvdidia site was just too new or something
