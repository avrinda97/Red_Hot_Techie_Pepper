2009-05-18T12:04:00.000Z	deantastic		hello all. I've booted into a live cd and am trying to repartition. I've screencapped my Gparted window - http://i41.tinypic.com/2dca81s.png I need to take some hd space away from /dev/sda1 and give it to /dev/sda6. Help?
2009-05-18T12:04:00.000Z	deantastic		I've tried resizing /dev/sda1 but I can't allocate the resulting free space to /dev/sda6
2009-05-18T12:05:00.000Z	boringpackets	deantastic	did you notice that warning sign on sda3?
2009-05-18T12:05:00.000Z	deantastic	boringpackets	yep, was wondering what that meant
2009-05-18T12:05:00.000Z	boringpackets	deantastic	you can use ntfsresize -o f
2009-05-18T12:06:00.000Z	deantastic	boringpackets	what would that do?
2009-05-18T12:07:00.000Z	deantastic	boringpackets	looks like -o isn't a valid option. perhaps you meant -i?
2009-05-18T12:08:00.000Z	deantastic	boringpackets	okay, thanks a lot :D
2009-05-18T12:09:00.000Z	boringpackets	deantastic	why do you have two swaps?
2009-05-18T12:09:00.000Z	deantastic	boringpackets	you see, I had a previous install of Ubuntu and decided to wipe my Ubuntu partition and do a clean install.
2009-05-18T12:09:00.000Z	deantastic	boringpackets	now all I did was delete my ubuntu partition in windows
2009-05-18T12:10:00.000Z	deantastic	boringpackets	the ~300mb swap is from the earlier install, the ~100mb from the install I did just now
2009-05-18T12:10:00.000Z	deantastic	boringpackets	would it be safe to delete the 300mb swap?
2009-05-18T12:10:00.000Z	boringpackets	deantastic	yes you actually dont need the swap
2009-05-18T12:11:00.000Z	deantastic	boringpackets	okay, imma delete the 300mb swap then. :)
2009-05-18T12:12:00.000Z	deantastic	boringpackets	looks like I can't delete 'em. tells me to unmount any logical partition having a higher number than 5. no biggie though
2009-05-18T12:14:00.000Z	deantastic	boringpackets	there's 15gb of unallocated space right now, just next to my /dev/sda6 (I haven't committed the resize yet, though). Still can't allocate that new space for /dev/sda6
2009-05-18T12:15:00.000Z	deantastic	boringpackets	I see. thanks anyway! :)
