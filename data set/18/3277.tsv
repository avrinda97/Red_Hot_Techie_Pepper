2010-10-29T02:59:00.000Z	Sonic132		Anyone know how to install the Cricket A600 USB Modem in Kubuntu 10.04? I tried the whole flipflop.sh thing and while it outputted a lot of information. It didn't seem to add anything to Network Config. What am I doing wrong? Also, I only have one Cricket modem. So if I try this I have to d/c and r/c to post more.
2010-10-29T03:01:00.000Z	Sonic132		If someone could just give me a link to a guide that works I'd appreciate it. I have some stuff to do in the yard. But later on I'll be able to work more on it.
2010-10-29T03:02:00.000Z	Sonic132		Isn't menu list always in the same place?
2010-10-29T03:03:00.000Z	Sonic132		Hmmm ok. I learned someothing yay.
2010-10-29T03:04:00.000Z	Sonic132		I need to know that as well Sir_Konrad
2010-10-29T03:04:00.000Z	Sonic132		I would think it was 32. But not sure.
2010-10-29T03:04:00.000Z	Sir_Konrad	Sonic132	Most of the time if you don't know then it's 32 bit, but I have so much things going on I probably knew a few months ago! XD
2010-10-29T03:07:00.000Z	Sir_Konrad	Sonic132	yeah..
2010-10-29T03:08:00.000Z	Sir_Konrad	Sonic132	mine is i686 is a 32 bit proc. x86_64 is always 64-bit.
2010-10-29T03:14:00.000Z	Sonic132	Sir_Konrad	What's the point in keeping an old version old? Why not upgrade?
2010-10-29T03:15:00.000Z	Sir_Konrad	Sonic132	LTS version.
2010-10-29T03:16:00.000Z	Sir_Konrad	Sonic132	Are you talking about why I would consider getting 10.04 for this MacBook?
2010-10-29T03:18:00.000Z	Sir_Konrad	Sonic132	you're on dial-up?
2010-10-29T03:19:00.000Z	Sonic132	Sir_Konrad	Cricket calls it broadband. But it's quite a bit slower than that.
2010-10-29T03:19:00.000Z	Sir_Konrad	Sonic132	oh you're hooking up via ethernet?
2010-10-29T03:19:00.000Z	Sonic132	Sir_Konrad	No hooking up via usb.
2010-10-29T03:19:00.000Z	Sonic132	Sir_Konrad	It's a usb modem.
2010-10-29T03:41:00.000Z	Sonic132	Sir_Konrad	Well he said that reinstalling works temporarily but then after a few boots it's hosed again.
