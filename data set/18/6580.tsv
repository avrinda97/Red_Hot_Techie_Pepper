2008-08-08T07:22:00.000Z	k4r1m		its not easy when you have 70 rar parts
2008-08-08T07:23:00.000Z	Shujah	k4r1m	so you want  a command that'll unrar them in bulk?
2008-08-08T07:28:00.000Z	Shujah	k4r1m	dude you are havbing problems trying to unrar and you want to start writing debian apps? :|
2008-08-08T07:29:00.000Z	k4r1m	Shujah	doesn't matter lol, i have done c++, and C# apps on windows and im pretty good with c++ and whats wrong with writing a deb app lol ;]
2008-08-08T07:30:00.000Z	k4r1m	Shujah	it would be alot easier if u guys tell me if there is a package that has what i need
2008-08-08T07:31:00.000Z	k4r1m	Shujah	isntead of just telling me to use the command line
2008-08-08T07:31:00.000Z	Shujah	k4r1m	you already have the package unrar - what you need to do is either select all .rar files right click and select extract here - or - write a script if the files are numerous and in folder heirarchy
2008-08-08T07:32:00.000Z	Shujah	k4r1m	also in *some* torrent downloads there is a single rar file and rest are named as .r01 .r02, if thats the case unrar only the .rar file rest will follow automatically
2008-08-08T07:33:00.000Z	k4r1m	Shujah	w\e i will if i could it get to work
2008-08-08T07:34:00.000Z	Shujah	k4r1m	open synaptic and search for unrar - what do you have installed
2008-08-08T07:35:00.000Z	Shujah	k4r1m	select a single rar file does it show you the command of extract here?
2008-08-08T07:36:00.000Z	k4r1m	Shujah	im suppose stupid, it actually does lol
