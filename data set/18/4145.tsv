2009-06-12T03:35:00.000Z	neodragon		I am using Jaunty on my main PC, has anyone else had a problem with the workspace switcher only showing you open apps in the "desk 1" panel even if you rotate the cube to the other desktops?
2009-06-12T03:36:00.000Z	texasjack	neodragon	bad compiz configuration?
2009-06-12T03:36:00.000Z	texasjack	neodragon	try to click on the pager and set more workspaces....
2009-06-12T03:36:00.000Z	texasjack	neodragon	or, go to ccsm, at General Options, and see what's in there....
2009-06-12T03:37:00.000Z	neodragon		texajack: under ccsm it is set to 4 desktops and on my pager it is also set to 4
2009-06-12T03:38:00.000Z	texasjack	neodragon	4 'desktops'.... That's wrong....
2009-06-12T03:39:00.000Z	texasjack	neodragon	it's about the 'Horizontal Virtual Size', set it to 4. and Vertical to 1... And your pager to 4...

2009-06-12T03:40:00.000Z	neodragon	texasjack	that worked, I don't know why I had desktops set to 4.

2009-06-12T03:41:00.000Z	neodragon	texasjack	so that option is for if I have multiple moniters set up right?
2009-06-12T03:42:00.000Z	texasjack	neodragon	but if you wanna something cool. Set the Horiz to 4, or even 8; and Vert to 2, or even 4... It's awesome see all those "desktops" in the Expo plug-in... =)
