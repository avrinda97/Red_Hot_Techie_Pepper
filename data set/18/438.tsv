2012-04-02T05:09:00.000Z	jlb181	sab0	 Yeah, download it from the website, it'll work.  I don't think it is in the repos.
2012-04-02T05:09:00.000Z	sab0	jlb181	i downloaded it and then tried to install
2012-04-02T05:10:00.000Z	jlb181	sab0	did you click the deb package in the downloads folder?

2012-04-02T05:11:00.000Z	jlb181	sab0	 downle click the package.  That should open USC and from there click install.

2012-04-02T05:16:00.000Z	jlb181		Does anybody know what that means?  Error Dependency is not satisfiable: python-aptdaemon.gtk3widgets
2012-04-02T05:16:00.000Z	jlb181	sab0	I would assume you need to install that dependancy first.
2012-04-02T05:19:00.000Z	jlb181	sab0	you can install that from the Ubunut software Center
2012-04-02T05:19:00.000Z	sab0	jlb181	ok
2012-04-02T05:21:00.000Z	jlb181	sab0	after you get the install try the Ubuntu-Tweak deb package again.
