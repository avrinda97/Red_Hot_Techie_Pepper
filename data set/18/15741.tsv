2005-06-22T08:59:00.000Z	levander		What's the name of the application that preloads libraries for you? Making loading applications faster?
2005-06-22T08:59:00.000Z	visor	levander	prelink... take care when using it
2005-06-22T09:00:00.000Z	levander	visor	is it a mess to use?
2005-06-22T09:00:00.000Z	visor	levander	no it is not, as long as you dont update or upgrade packages then trouble comes...
2005-06-22T09:00:00.000Z	visor	levander	because you have to "prelink" everything again
2005-06-22T09:01:00.000Z	visor	levander	what i did however, was to only prelink OpenOffice...
2005-06-22T09:01:00.000Z	levander	visor	mmmm, maybe i'll write a script to prelink all the stuff I want prelinked?
2005-06-22T09:01:00.000Z	levander	visor	yeah, i don't want to prelink everything, like maybe four apps
2005-06-22T09:02:00.000Z	visor	levander	you can safely, just make sure next time you update that app you prelink it again... i dont know if you know what prelink does...
2005-06-22T09:02:00.000Z	levander	visor	i only have vague idea about it modifying libaries to make them faster to load
2005-06-22T09:03:00.000Z	levander	visor	so, updating works fine, the only problem is when those prelinked libraries get updated, they are no longer prelinked?
2005-06-22T09:04:00.000Z	visor	levander	it kind's of copy symbols or code blocks to the aplications, so an app called foo uses a library called foo.so then prelink looks for the code in foo.so to kind of add it to the app so it loads faster
2005-06-22T09:04:00.000Z	levander	visor	but updating still works fine right? your updated app is just no longer prelinked?
2005-06-22T09:05:00.000Z	visor	levander	exactly, so if you update packages then the binaries will be overwritten with the new ones which have been no prelinked
2005-06-22T09:06:00.000Z	levander	visor	oh, i see what your saying, if an app is dependent upon the library, and the library gets updated, then your app is linked to the old un-updated library?
2005-06-22T09:06:00.000Z	visor	levander	and sometimes that makes problems, even apps not opening, so you have to do that each time you update stuff
2005-06-22T09:06:00.000Z	levander	visor	yech, that does sound like it could get messy
2005-06-22T09:07:00.000Z	levander	visor	how much faster did openoffice startup after you did this?
