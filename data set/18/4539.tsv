2009-07-09T21:43:00.000Z	vise		Is there any shortcut to switch tabs in gedit editor?
2009-07-09T21:43:00.000Z	grawity	vise	You could try Alt-1, Alt-2...
2009-07-09T21:44:00.000Z	vise	grawity	Hmm.. that works.. But not as good as CTRL-TAB in firefox..
2009-07-09T21:44:00.000Z	grawity	vise	Yeah, that's what I liked in Windows :/
2009-07-09T21:44:00.000Z	grawity	vise	I think there's Ctrl-Alt-PageUp/PageDown
2009-07-09T21:45:00.000Z	grawity	vise	And you can set your own shortcuts, apparently.
2009-07-09T21:46:00.000Z	vise	grawity	Where? in gedit or system-wide.. since i can't find a setting in gedit..
2009-07-09T21:46:00.000Z	grawity	vise	There's a system-wide option "Allow editing of menu shortcuts" in appearance.
2009-07-09T21:48:00.000Z	vise	grawity	I enabled that setting, but how do I edit shortcuts for gedit?
2009-07-09T21:49:00.000Z	grawity	vise	open the Window menu, select the "Previous window" item (do NOT click), and press the new shortcut.
2009-07-09T22:05:00.000Z	vise	grawity	Sorry if im being noobish, but i did not find any "edit shortcut" in the gedit menu. I clicked on Document, and there is "Next document" with a ctrl+alt+pgup shortcut. But it doesnt seem editable...
2009-07-09T22:06:00.000Z	grawity	vise	It might be that gedit simpy doesn't accept the shortcut you try to set.
2009-07-09T22:06:00.000Z	vise	grawity	But i didn't try to set any.. They don't still seem editable..
2009-07-09T22:07:00.000Z	grawity	vise	They don't seem editable until you try to set one.
2009-07-09T22:07:00.000Z	vise	grawity	How do you set one?
2009-07-09T22:07:00.000Z	vise	grawity	Ok.. nvm.. il google..
2009-07-09T22:07:00.000Z	grawity	vise	Simply press the new shortcut while the menu item is selected
2009-07-09T22:08:00.000Z	vise	grawity	Dude but there is no "new shortcut" to press when the menu item is selected...
