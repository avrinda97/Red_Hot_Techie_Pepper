2008-05-22T01:39:00.000Z	delire_	anabolix	one is your interface address and the other the network broadcast adress.
2008-05-22T01:45:00.000Z	delire_	anabolix	interface address is the 4 block number assigned to your network card. it is your numeric 'location' on that network.
2008-05-22T01:45:00.000Z	anabolix	delire_	and the broadcast address?
2008-05-22T01:46:00.000Z	delire_	anabolix	broadcast address described the range of numbers in which the network occupies..
2008-05-22T01:47:00.000Z	delire_	anabolix	eg, if your inet is: 192.168.1.201 your bcast range will be Bcast:192.168.1.255
2008-05-22T01:47:00.000Z	delire_	anabolix	broadcast isn't an address, so much as a range. inet is the address.
2008-05-22T01:48:00.000Z	anabolix	delire_	meaning that i have a range of 0-225 node available on the network, speaking in terms of bcast?
2008-05-22T01:48:00.000Z	delire_	anabolix	yep
2008-05-22T01:48:00.000Z	delire_	anabolix	256 possible numbers.
2008-05-22T01:49:00.000Z	anabolix	delire_	and that is determined by the last block?
2008-05-22T01:49:00.000Z	anabolix	delire_	could i ever change this figure, say incase i knew id have more that 255 addresses on the network?
2008-05-22T01:50:00.000Z	delire_	anabolix	the netmask has some influence on the available range. best to read up on the interaction between bcast and netmask
2008-05-22T01:51:00.000Z	delire_	anabolix	192.168 and 10.0 ranges are reserved for LANs. and no..  you can't have an address higher than 255 in the remaining two blocks.
2008-05-22T01:52:00.000Z	anabolix	delire_	how can i find my own internetIP address?
2008-05-22T01:52:00.000Z	delire_	anabolix	/sbin/ifconfig
2008-05-22T01:52:00.000Z	anabolix	delire_	is there some shell command that can check that for me
2008-05-22T01:52:00.000Z	delire_	anabolix	oh.. internet..
