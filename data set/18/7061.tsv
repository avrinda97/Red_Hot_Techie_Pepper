2011-10-26T05:16:00.000Z	wmoxam		Anyone got any recommendations for a twitter client?
2011-10-26T05:16:00.000Z	wmoxam		I'm finding that Gwitter just isn't cutting it
2011-10-26T05:18:00.000Z	graingert	wmoxam	TweetDeck for chrome
2011-10-26T05:19:00.000Z	wmoxam	graingert	  :/
2011-10-26T05:19:00.000Z	graingert	wmoxam	it's what I use
2011-10-26T05:19:00.000Z	graingert	wmoxam	well gwibber works with webkit and a veneer of gtk
2011-10-26T05:20:00.000Z	graingert	wmoxam	the tweetdeck for chrome is basically "native"
2011-10-26T05:20:00.000Z	wmoxam	graingert	gwibber is super slow
2011-10-26T05:20:00.000Z	graingert	wmoxam	as it only downloads stuff from twitter
2011-10-26T05:20:00.000Z	graingert	wmoxam	it has all it's resources stored locally
2011-10-26T05:20:00.000Z	graingert	wmoxam	if you manly use chrome, the tweetdeck app is the best way to go
2011-10-26T05:21:00.000Z	wmoxam	graingert	I'd just use twitter's web interface :p
2011-10-26T05:21:00.000Z	wmoxam	graingert	and I do use FF
2011-10-26T05:21:00.000Z	graingert	wmoxam	desktop notifications are super usefull
2011-10-26T05:27:00.000Z	wmoxam	graingert	Turpial is actually half decent
2011-10-26T05:35:00.000Z	graingert	wmoxam	what's wrong with that
2011-10-26T05:36:00.000Z	wmoxam	graingert	bad policy. Now I'll enter a password that I'll definately forget.
2011-10-26T05:36:00.000Z	graingert	wmoxam	lastpass
