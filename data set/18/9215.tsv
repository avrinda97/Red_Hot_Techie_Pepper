2007-09-10T11:16:00.000Z	wolfwalker		 Could someone add virtualbox to the repos?
2007-09-10T11:17:00.000Z	wolfwalker		 Why hate on gimp? Is there a better free one out there?
2007-09-10T11:17:00.000Z	wolfwalker		 nickrud, virtualbox is FREE! That's the reason I recommended it. :)
2007-09-10T09:43:00.000Z	wolfwalker		 Could someone recommend a good IRC server that has a webpage (php) interface?
2007-09-10T09:44:00.000Z	wolfwalker		 So people without a chat script can get on
2007-09-10T09:46:00.000Z	wolfwalker		|eyec0n:|  I'm not quite sure what I mean yet. I'm still investigating.
2007-09-10T09:46:00.000Z	wolfwalker		 But I want an IRC server that can be accessed through a webpage as well as with a normal chat client
2007-09-10T09:47:00.000Z	wolfwalker		 I want both actually
2007-09-10T09:47:00.000Z	wolfwalker		 And I want the client to interface well with the server
2007-09-10T09:47:00.000Z	wolfwalker		 Yes, and I understand the difference
2007-09-10T09:48:00.000Z	neverblue	wolfwalker	I think you want to research irc server daemons first
2007-09-10T09:49:00.000Z	neverblue	wolfwalker	then from there, you can create a site for the irc server, embedding a java irc client
2007-09-10T09:49:00.000Z	neverblue	wolfwalker	undernet has one, as an example...
2007-09-10T09:52:00.000Z	neverblue	wolfwalker	that has nothing to do with your previous questions :)
2007-09-10T09:52:00.000Z	neverblue	wolfwalker	possibly a memory issue, run memtest ?
2007-09-10T09:52:00.000Z	neverblue	wolfwalker	are you running the server version of ubuntu ?
2007-09-10T09:53:00.000Z	neverblue	wolfwalker	memtest ?
2007-09-10T09:54:00.000Z	neverblue	wolfwalker	if you have the image, run memtest
