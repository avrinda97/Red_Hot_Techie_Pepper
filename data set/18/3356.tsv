2009-10-24T03:22:00.000Z	WiresAP		Hi, I'm trying to install Ubuntu for the first time, and am doing so on a windows netbook ((eeePC 1005HA). I've followed all the instructions online, and checked the md5 sums of everything I was able to, but wubi will not run. Where might I get some help?

2009-10-24T03:24:00.000Z	n8tuser	WiresAP	-> try netbootin for a true install, wubi is more like a try out and kick the tires
2009-10-24T17:22:00.000Z	WiresAP	n8tuser	yes, there appear to be 4
2009-10-24T17:24:00.000Z	WiresAP	n8tuser	as far as I could tell, /dev/sda2 was unusued, so I selected it, hit edit partition, changed the "use as" option to ext3 journaling system, checked format partition, and gave / as mount point
2009-10-24T17:26:00.000Z	WiresAP	n8tuser	errr, if my answer didn't clear that up, I probably don't understand the question - how might I tell if one of the partitions is an extended partition?
2009-10-24T17:28:00.000Z	WiresAP	n8tuser	I'm running an eeepc asus 1005HA, so I am running the UNR installer from a usb key, as per instructions found on the web
2009-10-24T17:29:00.000Z	WiresAP	n8tuser	I was asked the configure the timezone and keyboard, and then asked which hard drive to choose - as I don't want to loose the windows partition I currently have, I clicked the advanced option, and have been trying to figure out what to do from there

2009-10-24T18:07:00.000Z	WiresAP	n8tuser	is there anyway to take sda2 and turn it into an extended partition?
2009-10-24T18:14:00.000Z	WiresAP	n8tuser	thanks for the help, I'm gonna take a break from this and try again later
