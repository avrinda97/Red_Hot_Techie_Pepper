2009-06-09T16:12:00.000Z	brabo	mib_y0s4gc	fist you need to detach the screen with ctrl-a d
2009-06-09T16:12:00.000Z	brabo	mib_y0s4gc	or you can connect with screen -x
2009-06-09T16:15:00.000Z	mib_y0s4gc		why i get only half the screen
2009-06-09T16:16:00.000Z	mib_y0s4gc		i need full screen at the other pc. i do screen -x pid
2009-06-09T16:17:00.000Z	brabo	mib_y0s4gc	that's because it it still atached on another terminal.. that's why the format doesn't adapt, so detach the aother session first with ctrl-a d

2009-06-09T16:22:00.000Z	brabo	mib_y0s4gc	on the server you issue in screen the key combination ctrl-a d  that detaches your session
2009-06-09T16:22:00.000Z	brabo		the you do the same on client side and the on client side screen -r
