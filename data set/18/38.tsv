2012-11-18T06:47:00.000Z	newroad		re-installing the drivers drought back my access to the desktop, but after I log in, unity never loads. I have just a blank desktop (with the abiilty to open terminal through hotkey).. any ideas?
2012-11-18T06:48:00.000Z	kostkon	newroad	did you try resetting it? http://www.webupd8.org/2012/10/how-to-reset-compiz-and-unity-in-ubuntu.html
2012-11-18T06:49:00.000Z	newroad	kostkon	yes i did
2012-11-18T06:49:00.000Z	kostkon	newroad	hmm, ok then
2012-11-18T06:49:00.000Z	newroad		but not all of the commands listed here on this page. let me try this
2012-11-18T06:57:00.000Z	newroad	kostkon	when I do unity-reset I get this error: "extension GLX is missing on display ":0.0".
2012-11-18T06:57:00.000Z	newroad		and: "Fatal: glxQueryExtensionsString is NULL for screen 0"
2012-11-18T06:58:00.000Z	newroad		davelindenberg: its a Geforce 650M
2012-11-18T06:58:00.000Z	kostkon	newroad	try rebooting again
2012-11-18T07:00:00.000Z	newroad		k, just rebooted kostkon, same thing
2012-11-18T07:02:00.000Z	kostkon	newroad	did you install the nvidia graphics driver? check which driver you are using, try giving in the terminal: software-properties-gtk  hopefully the window will show up
2012-11-18T07:03:00.000Z	newroad	kostkon	i just installed the latest video driver per someone else in this channel
2012-11-18T07:03:00.000Z	newroad		i had this problem before isntalling the nvidia driver, however.
2012-11-18T07:04:00.000Z	kostkon	newroad	it seems that something has gone wrong then
2012-11-18T07:04:00.000Z	newroad	kostkon	I realize ;)
2012-11-18T07:06:00.000Z	newroad		btw, it looks like i can get a session manager to come up if I use Gnome. but both Cinnamon and Unity do not work
2012-11-18T07:07:00.000Z	newroad		when I open nvidia x server settings it says: "You do not appear to be using the NVIDIA V Driver. Please edit you X config file"
2012-11-18T07:08:00.000Z	kostkon	newroad	I think you need to remove that driver and try again to install the one from the repos. Or at least, open the software sources and select the nouveau driver, and there is a possibility that unity will start after enabling it.
