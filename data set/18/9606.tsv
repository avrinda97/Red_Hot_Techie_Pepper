2007-03-16T15:49:00.000Z	ep2011		should I burn the ubuntu cd with a speed like 3x?
2007-03-16T15:49:00.000Z	jrib	ep2011	yes
2007-04-04T06:59:00.000Z	jrib	ep2011	copy and paste it to your machine and decrypt it there
2007-04-04T06:59:00.000Z	ep2011	jrib	how?
2007-04-04T07:00:00.000Z	jrib	ep2011	does that help?
2007-04-26T06:02:00.000Z	jrib	ep2011	I agree with bruenig's choice
2007-04-26T06:03:00.000Z	jrib	ep2011	yes, but it's just preference.  Try both and use what works best for you
2007-04-26T06:04:00.000Z	ep2011	jrib	which codecs would I install for mplayer, it uses xine if im not mistaken, so not the gstreamer codecs?
2007-04-26T06:04:00.000Z	jrib	ep2011	you shouldn't need to install anything afaik.  w32codecs if you want, but I haven't needed them
2007-04-26T06:04:00.000Z	jrib	ep2011	mplayer doesn't use xine btw
2007-04-26T06:05:00.000Z	ep2011	jrib	what does it use? and for codecs like avi which arent installed? Or does mplayer install them
2007-04-26T06:06:00.000Z	jrib	ep2011	you should be ready to go by just installing "mplayer" from the repos
2007-04-26T06:06:00.000Z	ep2011	jrib	okay, thanks ill try that
2007-04-26T06:07:00.000Z	ep2011	jrib	yep, thank you, it installs all the codecs when you install mplayer
2007-04-26T06:07:00.000Z	ep2011	jrib	one last thing, do you know the package name for mplayer firefox plugin?
2007-04-26T06:07:00.000Z	jrib	ep2011	mozilla-mplayer
2007-04-26T06:08:00.000Z	ep2011	jrib	thanks
2007-07-18T13:33:00.000Z	jrib	ep2011	liferea is nice
