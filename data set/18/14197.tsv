2005-09-16T13:06:00.000Z	thoreauputic	candlelight	recovery mode does not ask for a password, it dumps you at a root prompt
2005-09-16T15:26:00.000Z	thoreauputic	candlelight	you didn't get a # prompt? (that's wht it does here)
2005-09-16T15:27:00.000Z	candlelight	thoreauputic	no, I didn't, it says either enter a root passwd, or press Ctrl -D, which continue to level 2 then finally gnome
2005-09-16T15:27:00.000Z	thoreauputic	candlelight	hmm
2005-09-16T15:27:00.000Z	thoreauputic	candlelight	don't know why then
2005-09-16T15:28:00.000Z	candlelight	thoreauputic	the recovery mode is choosing the kernel - recovery right?
2005-09-16T15:29:00.000Z	thoreauputic	candlelight	it's been a while since I tried it, but I seem to recall you choose "recovery" in the boot menu
2005-09-16T15:29:00.000Z	thoreauputic	candlelight	you hit <esc> to get the menu
2005-09-16T15:29:00.000Z	candlelight	thoreauputic	yup, I chose recovery from the menu, even tried single user mode
2005-09-16T15:29:00.000Z	thoreauputic	candlelight	it's a mystery then ;)
2005-09-16T15:30:00.000Z	thoreauputic	candlelight	to me anyway
2005-09-16T15:31:00.000Z	candlelight	thoreauputic	ok.. I'll see if I can find out, need to compile a kernel to include reiserfs anyway
2005-09-16T15:33:00.000Z	thoreauputic	candlelight	ah - have you set up a root account?
2005-09-16T15:35:00.000Z	candlelight	thoreauputic	it's currently passwd -l
2005-09-16T15:36:00.000Z	thoreauputic	candlelight	I seem to recall the default root prompt is a hack for sudo: possibly having a root account disables it?
2005-09-16T15:36:00.000Z	candlelight	thoreauputic	nope, I mean I've locked the root a/c
2005-09-16T15:37:00.000Z	thoreauputic	candlelight	I understand that: I mean if it knows a root pass exists perhaps it doesn't do the default behaviour
