2008-12-20T00:34:00.000Z	hendrixski		Anybody recommend a screen-scraping solution where it can fill out a form and iterate through the resulting links finding the email address in the linked page?

2008-12-20T00:36:00.000Z	raylu	hendrixski	it's easier to just parse the html
2008-12-20T00:36:00.000Z	raylu	hendrixski	as far as filling a form, send the http request with the appropriate get/post information
2008-12-20T00:37:00.000Z	hendrixski	raylu	ah, that makes sense...
2008-12-20T00:37:00.000Z	hendrixski	raylu	so the page I'd get after entering the data (through get/post) will have links.  I would just parse info from those links separately... there's no program that can automate this? I'd have to write it in like Groovy, or Ruby, or.. something, right?
2008-12-20T00:38:00.000Z	raylu	hendrixski	perl :D
2008-12-20T00:38:00.000Z	raylu	hendrixski	there are premade libraries to do exactly what you want
2008-12-20T00:39:00.000Z	hendrixski	raylu	yeah,  I was kind of hoping there was a program that could do it instead of me having to script it
2008-12-20T00:39:00.000Z	hendrixski	raylu	do you know of anything like that/
2008-12-20T00:39:00.000Z	raylu	hendrixski	we call it firefox :D
2008-12-20T00:39:00.000Z	hendrixski	raylu	LOL
2008-12-20T00:40:00.000Z	raylu	hendrixski	no, it was a joke :(
2008-12-20T00:41:00.000Z	hendrixski	raylu	you were right though:  http://simile.mit.edu/wiki/Solvent
2008-12-20T00:42:00.000Z	raylu	hendrixski	woah, impressive
2008-12-20T00:43:00.000Z	hendrixski	raylu	yeah, and the screencast is sweet
2008-12-20T00:43:00.000Z	hendrixski	raylu	thanks for the inspiration :-)
2008-12-20T00:43:00.000Z	raylu	hendrixski	heh, no problem
