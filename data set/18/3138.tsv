2009-12-03T01:16:00.000Z	nanonanu	ojii	the path to get to that may not have the correct perms,
2009-12-03T01:16:00.000Z	ojii	nanonanu	chown -R username:group /that/path didn't help....
2009-12-03T01:16:00.000Z	nanonanu	ojii	a directory without the correct perms may not be traversed
2009-12-03T01:16:00.000Z	ojii	nanonanu	?
2009-12-03T01:17:00.000Z	nanonanu	ojii	you are not following, the parent dir may not have the correct perms to allow you to view it
2009-12-03T01:17:00.000Z	ojii	nanonanu	why would a user need to be allowed to view parent dirs of his homedir?
2009-12-03T01:17:00.000Z	nanonanu	ojii	does it work fo ryou?
2009-12-03T01:17:00.000Z	ojii	nanonanu	?
2009-12-03T01:18:00.000Z	nanonanu	ojii	btw those are not common places to put a home directory
2009-12-03T01:18:00.000Z	ojii	nanonanu	I know! but it's a ftp user which needs access to a dir in var www only! because it's only for a website!
2009-12-03T01:19:00.000Z	nanonanu	ojii	-> you are not getting the point, to traverse a directory path, the user must have a valid perms to traverse it
2009-12-03T01:20:00.000Z	ojii	nanonanu	define 'valid perms to traverse it', i don't want to give the user rights to actually do a lot in the directories below his home dir
2009-12-03T01:20:00.000Z	nanonanu	ojii	-> try as that user, traversing each dir path one by one
2009-12-03T01:21:00.000Z	nanonanu	ojii	-> there grawity made it clearer for me .. thanks
2009-12-03T01:24:00.000Z	nanonanu	ojii	-> i know this is an extra work for you, but try  man chmod
2009-12-03T01:27:00.000Z	nanonanu	ojii	->  really sometimes one need to spend some time reviewing file/dir permissions
2009-12-03T01:27:00.000Z	ojii	nanonanu	yea i didn't know about the traversing-thing, was only thinking about the actual dir...
2009-12-03T01:28:00.000Z	nanonanu	ojii	-> but am glad you picked up a new thing to learn
