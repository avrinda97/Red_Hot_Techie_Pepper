2007-02-23T13:11:00.000Z	midgetg0at		i'm reinstalling ndiswrapper and am going to load the drivers.
2007-02-23T13:11:00.000Z	macd	midgetg0at	its atheros ?
2007-02-23T13:12:00.000Z	midgetg0at	macd	i believe so. that name is soo familiar.
2007-02-23T13:12:00.000Z	macd	midgetg0at	yes its atheros, dont use ndiswrapper, just "sudo modprobe atheros" then plug it in.
2007-02-23T13:14:00.000Z	midgetg0at	macd	FATAL: Module atheros not found.
2007-02-23T13:14:00.000Z	midgetg0at	macd	any idea why i get module atheros not found? how to make it found?
2007-02-23T13:14:00.000Z	macd	midgetg0at	yeah I gave you the wrong name use ath_pci
2007-02-23T13:15:00.000Z	macd	midgetg0at	or more approriatly ath_usb ;)
2007-02-23T13:15:00.000Z	midgetg0at	macd	ath_usb was not found, but ath_pci was
2007-02-23T13:27:00.000Z	macd	midgetg0at	does it show in "lspci" ?
2007-02-23T13:29:00.000Z	macd	midgetg0at	man you should be able to just use the kernel atheros drivers, but meh if ndiswrapper works go with it.
2007-02-23T13:30:00.000Z	midgetg0at	macd	by use, you mean?
2007-02-23T13:36:00.000Z	macd	midgetg0at	nahh you just didnt see your ethernet cable plugged in ;P
