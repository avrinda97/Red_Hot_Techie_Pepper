2008-06-23T22:33:00.000Z	ASULutzy	ziggy	Are you just trying to download KDE?
2008-06-23T22:34:00.000Z	ASULutzy	ziggy	KDE4 or KDE3.5?
2008-06-23T22:34:00.000Z	ASULutzy	ziggy	Why can't you just sudo apt-get install kde4base ?
2008-06-23T22:35:00.000Z	ASULutzy	ziggy	On OpenSuse11 I have both Gnome and KDE4 installed, so it is certainly possible to setup both KDE and Gnome simultaneously on the same install
2008-06-23T22:35:00.000Z	ASULutzy	ziggy	?
2008-06-23T22:35:00.000Z	ASULutzy	ziggy	Then you need a Kubuntu cd
2008-06-23T22:36:00.000Z	ASULutzy	ziggy	Or you just need to get internet on that machine working. and now I see why your question has been answered 4 times. Why are you still asking it?
2008-06-23T22:39:00.000Z	ASULutzy	ziggy	Kubuntu is just Ubuntu with KDE as its desktop manager instead of Gnome. There's really no fundamental difference, and if you wanted to you could install KDE apps inside of Gnome (amarok for example is a KDE app that I'd be willing to bet 80% of this channel has installed even though they're using Gnome, not KDE) There's nothing stopping you from using KDE apps inside of Gnome or vice versa
