2007-04-20T10:23:00.000Z	Draconicus		Enough with the newbies. I have a real question, and it matters!
2007-04-20T10:24:00.000Z	deepsa	Draconicus	whats that
2007-04-20T10:24:00.000Z	Draconicus	deepsa	apt can't lock the list directory. There's no explanation given.
2007-04-20T10:24:00.000Z	deepsa	Draconicus	/var/log?
2007-04-20T10:24:00.000Z	Draconicus	deepsa	Dude, this is from a fresh install. Zero change.
2007-04-20T10:25:00.000Z	deepsa	Draconicus	whatever check logs
2007-04-20T10:25:00.000Z	Draconicus	deepsa	There's no log for apt.
2007-04-20T10:25:00.000Z	deepsa	Draconicus	whats the error
2007-04-20T10:27:00.000Z	Draconicus	deepsa	"Could not get lock /var/lib/apt/lists/lock - open (11 Resource temporarily unavailable)
2007-04-20T10:27:00.000Z	deepsa	Draconicus	it seems process for apt is running
2007-04-20T10:28:00.000Z	Draconicus	deepsa	Unless you guys stuffed some retarded automatic updater in there at the last minute that runs without saying anything, there's nothing that would be using it.
2007-04-20T10:28:00.000Z	deepsa	Draconicus	ps aux | grep apt please
2007-04-20T10:30:00.000Z	Draconicus	deepsa	Well that's interesting. Either there was an invisible instance of Synaptic or it was labeling both the Synaptic main window and error window. Either way, it showed two different windows with very different owners, but one was created by root, while the other was in gksu, so it's still plausably the first. I'll try reloading again.
2007-04-20T10:31:00.000Z	deepsa	Draconicus	well man when u do a fresh install update manager runs in the background
2007-04-20T10:31:00.000Z	Draconicus	deepsa	That's a pain in the ass. You should disable that.
2007-04-20T10:31:00.000Z	Draconicus	deepsa	It'll confuse the hell out of new users.
2007-04-20T10:31:00.000Z	deepsa	Draconicus	we will in gusty okay man
