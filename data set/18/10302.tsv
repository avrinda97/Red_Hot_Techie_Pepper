2008-02-12T08:29:00.000Z	bcardarella		I can play WMV video just fine but the audio does not play. I have VLC installed but still no audio. I'm sure there is an answer in the forums but I can't seem to find it... does anybody have a thought?
2008-02-12T08:30:00.000Z	badkitty	bcardarella	Do you have the media codecs installed?
2008-02-12T08:31:00.000Z	badkitty	bcardarella	I don't know how to troubleshoot sound, but I would check to make sure you have the codecs downloaded
2008-02-12T08:31:00.000Z	bcardarella	badkitty	I tried to install w32codecs but those don't exist in repo anymore... is there another package? (other than what attempts to install automatically)
2008-02-12T08:31:00.000Z	badkitty	bcardarella	You have to add the medibuntu repo
2008-02-12T08:31:00.000Z	bcardarella	badkitty	ah, okay. I'll look for that
2008-02-12T08:31:00.000Z	bcardarella	badkitty	thanks
2008-02-12T08:31:00.000Z	badkitty	bcardarella	I would install ubuntu-restricted-extras as well
2008-02-12T08:33:00.000Z	bcardarella	badkitty	I'm think I already have that repo
2008-02-12T08:34:00.000Z	badkitty	bcardarella	Nah, if you did it would have installed the codecs .. unless you are putting it in wrong or dont have the key
2008-02-12T08:36:00.000Z	bcardarella	badkitty	no good, still no audio.. oh well
2008-02-12T08:36:00.000Z	badkitty	bcardarella	You said it works for other media? The audio
2008-02-12T08:37:00.000Z	bcardarella	badkitty	yeah, I can play mp3
2008-02-12T08:37:00.000Z	badkitty	bcardarella	Were you able to install the w32codecs?
2008-02-12T08:38:00.000Z	bcardarella	badkitty	yeap
2008-02-12T08:39:00.000Z	bcardarella	badkitty	yeah, I installed that package. Earlier I thought you were referring to the restricted repo...
2008-02-12T08:39:00.000Z	badkitty	bcardarella	hmmm.. perhaps its the media itself?
2008-02-12T08:40:00.000Z	bcardarella	badkitty	maybe. It's just a video from IGN that I wanted to watch.
