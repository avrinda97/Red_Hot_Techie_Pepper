2009-07-20T08:37:00.000Z	Roasted		guest92063 - I'm confused. what is /tmp? How do I save a video through that? Its a flash video embedded on a web site I want to download. I cant figure out how.
2009-07-20T08:38:00.000Z	ghindo	Roasted	/tmp is the directory for temporary files in the Linux filesystem.  If you load a flash video, the video should also load in /tmp
2009-07-20T08:39:00.000Z	Roasted	ghindo	- Let me get this straight... if I watch a video through firefox that's a flash video, it'll somehow "download" temporarily to the /tmp folder??
2009-07-20T08:39:00.000Z	ghindo	Roasted	Correct.
2009-07-20T08:39:00.000Z	Roasted	ghindo	- what do I have to do? Just play the video and it appears? Cause I'm not seeing it now...
2009-07-20T08:40:00.000Z	ghindo	Roasted	You have to load the video entirely in the browser and the video _should_ show up in /tmp
2009-07-20T08:40:00.000Z	Roasted	ghindo	- just let it buffer completely? Or completely watch it? I'm just confused over how this works...
2009-07-20T08:41:00.000Z	ghindo	Roasted	Just let it buffer completely
2009-07-20T08:41:00.000Z	Roasted	ghindo	- I'm pretty sure it did buffer completely, becuase this is the 2nd time I'm watching it without having refreshed the web site...
2009-07-20T08:42:00.000Z	ghindo	Roasted	Well, what are you seeing in the /tmp directory?

2009-07-20T08:44:00.000Z	Roasted	ghindo	- did you get that?
2009-07-20T08:44:00.000Z	ghindo	Roasted	Yeah, just gimme a sec
2009-07-20T08:44:00.000Z	Roasted		steve - theres kindergarten rules around here. If you dont wanna get banned 40 times over you might wanna say shoot instead :P
2009-07-20T08:46:00.000Z	ghindo	Roasted	Try refreshing /tmp and checking again.  I'm loading a YouTube video and it's loading into /tmp as well, so it _should_ be the same in your case
2009-07-20T08:47:00.000Z	Roasted	ghindo	- I went to youtube and it loads a video in tmp, but this particular web site doesnt show anything in tmp
2009-07-20T08:47:00.000Z	ghindo	Roasted	Interesting.  I'm not sure, then.  Sorry.
2009-07-20T08:47:00.000Z	Roasted	ghindo	- if you want to PM me (no idea how to do simple things in xchat) I can link you to the video Im trying to DL
