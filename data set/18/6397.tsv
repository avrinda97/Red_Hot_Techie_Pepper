2008-05-29T22:34:00.000Z	gpled		would like /dev/sda2 to boot using grub and kernel off of live 8.04.  can anyone help me with this?
2008-05-29T22:35:00.000Z	gpled		was thining, copy /boot from cd, to sda2, then run grub-install /dev/sda2  . that does not seem to work
2008-05-29T22:36:00.000Z	Steve-cal	gpled	Does sda2 all ready have an OS installed in it?
2008-05-29T22:36:00.000Z	gpled	Steve-cal	nope
2008-05-29T22:37:00.000Z	gpled	Steve-cal	just swap and ext3 partions
2008-05-29T22:37:00.000Z	Steve-cal	gpled	And out of curiosity then, why are you trying to install Grub to that partition if it has no OS?
2008-05-29T22:37:00.000Z	gpled	Steve-cal	have / dir, but they are empty
2008-05-29T22:38:00.000Z	gpled	Steve-cal	trying to do a ground up install
2008-05-29T22:38:00.000Z	Steve-cal	gpled	Are you planning on installing a OS to that partition at some point?
2008-05-29T22:39:00.000Z	gpled	Steve-cal	peace by peace.  will start with some bin files then start adding souce for programs
2008-05-29T22:41:00.000Z	gpled	Steve-cal	should i be able to get a kernal to boot off the drive like that?
2008-05-29T22:42:00.000Z	Steve-cal	gpled	Well I don't think just copying over the /boot directory from your liveCD to your sda2 partition will work. You need to formally install Grub to that partition. And about the kernel, depends probably how you put it there--a simple copy won't likely work.
2008-05-29T22:43:00.000Z	gpled	Steve-cal	grub should just boot on its own, even if i do not have a kernal, right?
2008-05-29T22:44:00.000Z	Steve-cal	gpled	If you have Grub installed correctly, I believe the answer is yes.
2008-05-29T22:45:00.000Z	Steve-cal	gpled	That command will not work I don't think--that command is used to install grub into the MBR, not a partition.
2008-05-29T22:46:00.000Z	Steve-cal	gpled	I think you would be better off asking in #grub, but that's just an idea. :)
2008-05-29T22:46:00.000Z	gpled	Steve-cal	sounds like a good idea :)
2008-05-29T22:49:00.000Z	Steve-cal	gpled	No problem, good luck with it.
