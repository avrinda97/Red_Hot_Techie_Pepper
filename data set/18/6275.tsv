2008-05-31T15:52:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Zbradsta	 ubuntu uses repositories. for the software..  there are unoffical ones not enabled by default.

2008-05-31T15:53:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Zbradsta	 windows 'thinking' is downloading from a web site to install..  "linux" thinking is to use the Package manager tool for your Linux Disrto to install things. :)

2008-05-31T15:55:00.000Z	Dr_willis	Zbradsta	  feisty (games): Data files for vdrift, a racing simulation [universe]  - the game seems to be in the Universe Repository.
