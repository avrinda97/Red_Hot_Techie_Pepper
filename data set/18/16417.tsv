2009-08-03T17:10:00.000Z	Rods_Tiger		What exactly is it that causes Ubuntu Netbook Remix on my Acer Aspire One to simply ignore me for ages, each time I want to interact with it?
2009-08-03T17:11:00.000Z	Rods_Tiger		It's becoming highly irritating to use, because I know it'll freeze every time I touch it, for a short while.
2009-08-03T17:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Rods_Tiger	 Hmm.. UNR works good here on my AAO. i am using the normal ubuntu desktop i installed on it. and i followed some tweaks in the AAO forums.
2009-08-03T17:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Rods_Tiger	 ive never noticed the isue..   you are refering to useing the touchpad 'scroll' areas? or a mousewheel?
2009-08-03T17:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Rods_Tiger	 thats why i asked. I dont seem to have the issue here. but i tend to use a mouse with mine.  could be some of the tweaks i did from the AAO forums tweaked the touchpad.  I  am using some example xorg.conf configs from t eh forums
2009-08-03T17:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Rods_Tiger	 i would say check out the AAO forum threads - see if others have similer issues. there are some kernel boot tweaks/options that may help.
2009-08-03T17:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Rods_Tiger	 then just give up.. whatever you want...  aparently you dont want 'help'
2009-08-03T17:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Rods_Tiger	 do whatever you want.. have fun.
2009-11-28T22:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Rods_Tiger	 system tasks need password.. plain and simple..
2009-11-28T22:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Rods_Tiger	 theres tools to set up auto dateing.
2009-11-28T23:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Rods_Tiger	 check out sudoers configing and tweak it if you want
2009-11-28T23:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Rods_Tiger	 then disable the password stuff.. because you are a single user.. dosent mean I want that  to be the default on my pc, or my work servers..
2009-11-28T23:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Rods_Tiger	 check the 'sudoers' system/command/configs is one way. theres also services/tools i recall that can auto-install updates if thats all you are worried about
2010-03-31T16:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Rods_Tiger	 given gnomes total lack of screensaver confiuragion... im not sure  its doable.  THere may be some gconf settings.
2010-03-31T16:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Rods_Tiger	 gnome is rather lacking in screensaver 'features'  theres the xscreensaver package you can install and have more/better controll
2010-03-31T16:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Rods_Tiger	 kde's screensavers are amazingly more usefull :)
2010-03-31T16:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Rods_Tiger	 read their guide. Its got some very nice features in the 4.4 version  but lacking in some ways compared to the idiotproffing thats in gnome
2010-03-31T16:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Rods_Tiger	 i recall some firefox extension that could do that.   not really a screensaver.. but more of a ditital pictureframe feature that used local and network sources
