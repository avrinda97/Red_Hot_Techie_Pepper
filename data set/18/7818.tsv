2007-11-16T07:01:00.000Z	sfears		so i
2007-11-16T07:02:00.000Z	sfears		wooops
2007-11-16T07:02:00.000Z	sfears		i'm in the middle of distro upgrade, it finished fetching the upgrades, it has an arrow beside installing the upgrades but i think it's stuck, is there a way to see if it's working
2007-11-16T07:02:00.000Z	sfears		it's still at 0% and i don't see anything moving
2007-11-16T07:03:00.000Z	sfears		it finished fetching.. now it's stuck at installing
2007-11-16T07:03:00.000Z	sfears		alright
2007-11-16T07:03:00.000Z	Pelo	sfears	like I said, once it has fetched, it might need some more files,  be very patient
2007-11-16T07:15:00.000Z	Pelo	sfears	7.04 is feisty yes
2008-03-08T06:25:00.000Z	Pelo	sfears	I would review what you did when you "played around" see what might have messed up your nvidia settings,  I can't realy tell what migth have gone wrong but I know that resintalling a package doesn't reset settings and such
2008-03-08T06:26:00.000Z	Pelo	sfears	not realy,  what is it that is not working ? video ? sound ?
2008-03-08T06:28:00.000Z	sfears	Pelo	when i enable restriced drivers & reboot.. i lose the gui logon screen.. if i command startx.. i get an error about not finding /etc/nvidia0 or something & screens found with no useable configuration
2008-03-08T06:30:00.000Z	Pelo	sfears	I'm not sure but did you say you tried dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg ? that would be my suggestion
2008-03-11T03:40:00.000Z	sfears	Pelo	drink much?
2008-03-11T03:40:00.000Z	Pelo	sfears	keyboard was just a little too far
2008-03-11T03:41:00.000Z	Pelo	sfears	I haven'T had so much as a drop since the holidays
2008-03-13T04:23:00.000Z	Pelo	sfears	I think you can do it with the search app, check the more options fields
2008-03-13T04:34:00.000Z	Pelo	sfears	sudo ....
