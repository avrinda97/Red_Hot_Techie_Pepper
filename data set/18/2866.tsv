2010-02-03T14:30:00.000Z	pweezy		hi, hi, im trying to get an hd 5770 running on 9.10
2010-02-03T14:30:00.000Z	pweezy		with fglrx?
2010-02-03T14:30:00.000Z	pweezy		i get a hard lock when i use fglrx, though :/
2010-02-03T14:31:00.000Z	pweezy		catalyst 10.1?
2010-02-03T14:33:00.000Z	pweezy		eek how do i disable/change the 'dont run as root' policy in effect on ubuntu?
2010-02-03T14:34:00.000Z	Slart	pweezy	you mean the "cannot login as root to gnome"-setting?
2010-02-03T14:34:00.000Z	pweezy	Slart	no i mean the "cannot log in as root in bash" setting
2010-02-03T14:35:00.000Z	Slart	pweezy	hmm.. not sure about that really.. make sure root has a valid login shell in /etc/passwd
2010-02-03T14:36:00.000Z	Slart	pweezy	of course I have to throw the obligatory "you can use sudo -i to get a root shell" at you
2010-02-03T14:36:00.000Z	pweezy		 Slart root is set to bash in /etc/passwd
2010-02-03T14:36:00.000Z	pweezy		no i just want to use su.
2010-02-03T14:36:00.000Z	pweezy		as is the standard.
2010-02-03T14:37:00.000Z	Slart	pweezy	can't help you any further then.. sorry
2010-02-03T14:37:00.000Z	pweezy	Slart	ok thanks anyway the i switch helps alot though
2010-02-03T14:38:00.000Z	pweezy		i just do not, not, not, not like that my users can use -their- password to execute commands as -root-.
2010-02-03T14:38:00.000Z	Slart	pweezy	you're welcome
2010-02-03T14:38:00.000Z	Slart	pweezy	then disable it in the sudoers file
2010-02-03T14:39:00.000Z	Slart	pweezy	you can even disable certain commands while letting them use sudo to run other commands.. so sudo cp works.. but not gksudo gpartedf
