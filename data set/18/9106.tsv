2007-05-08T15:10:00.000Z	SkWaRa		hi all, can any one tell me how to make ubuntu stream computer name to a router?
2007-05-08T15:11:00.000Z	eck	SkWaRa	how do you mean?
2007-05-08T15:12:00.000Z	SkWaRa	eck	let me explain it :) it might take some time as I'm from Polish and my english isn't good :_
2007-05-08T15:13:00.000Z	SkWaRa	eck	I have a Netgear wgt634v2 router, with wireless enabled and WPA-PSK as a encryption method
2007-05-08T15:14:00.000Z	SkWaRa	eck	also I'm using mac address filtering
2007-05-08T15:14:00.000Z	SkWaRa	eck	if I am on windows and I go to mac address filter page and try to add router shows skwara-lap - MAC addr of wi-fi
2007-05-08T15:15:00.000Z	eck	SkWaRa	can you just not manually enter the MAC address?
2007-05-08T15:15:00.000Z	SkWaRa	eck	but if I''m on ubuntu and go to this page it shows Unknown - MAC Addr
2007-05-08T15:17:00.000Z	eck	SkWaRa	so you need to enter the computer's mac address into a page on the router, right?
2007-05-08T15:18:00.000Z	SkWaRa	eck	there's a radio with Unknown and Mac addres next to it (on the router's page) and under it there are two inputs, one for computer name and second for MAC
2007-05-08T15:18:00.000Z	eck	SkWaRa	i believe you can put anything for the computer name, that is just there so you remember which computer is associated with the mac address
2007-05-08T15:19:00.000Z	SkWaRa	eck	ok than, but why I cannot connect while I'm on ubuntu, and why there's Unknown on the router's page, while on windows there is my computer name that I've set
2007-05-08T15:20:00.000Z	eck	SkWaRa	maybe it's the NetBIOS computer name? If you're router requires that, i'm not sure if there's a netbios service for linux
2007-05-08T15:23:00.000Z	SkWaRa	eck	in windows' wifi connection I have checked check-box: Use NetBIOS settings from the DHCP server. If static IP address is used or the DHCP server deos not provide NetBIOS setting, enable NetBIOS over TCP/IP. So is there any chance to get it works whith MAC filter turned on?
2007-05-08T15:24:00.000Z	eck	SkWaRa	i think you should turn off NetBIOS completely
2007-05-08T15:25:00.000Z	eck	SkWaRa	on my router i can have dhcp hand out static IPs based on MAC address alone, i'm not sure about yours, but that would be better than using NetBIOS
2007-05-08T15:25:00.000Z	SkWaRa	eck	I think there's no such option in my router
2007-05-08T15:26:00.000Z	eck	SkWaRa	the problem is that there is not a netbios service running on ubuntu
