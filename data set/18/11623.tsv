2006-07-06T11:54:00.000Z	student27		could anyone tell me how to handle a failure with the automatic configuration of dhcp while installing xubuntu?
2006-07-06T11:55:00.000Z	sys8976	student27	elaberate please
2006-07-06T11:57:00.000Z	sys8976	student27	have you tried running the cd live mode on your xp machine?
2006-07-06T12:01:00.000Z	sys8976	student27	 sorry helping 4 at same time one sec please
2006-07-06T12:03:00.000Z	sys8976	student27	ok so you have installed this on an old machine or the xp machine?
2006-07-06T12:04:00.000Z	sys8976	student27	ok and you just cant resolve dhcp right?
2006-07-06T12:04:00.000Z	sys8976	student27	ok so the nix box isnt getting ip at all? what happens if you type ifconfig
2006-07-06T12:05:00.000Z	sys8976	student27	ahh ok..maybe a bad stick of ram, how much ram do you have in there
2006-07-06T12:05:00.000Z	sys8976	student27	should with no prob, is it one stick or two?
2006-07-06T12:06:00.000Z	sys8976	student27	was an os runniing on this before with the same hardware?
2006-07-06T12:06:00.000Z	sys8976	student27	do you have another nic that you can install for testing?
2006-07-06T12:06:00.000Z	sys8976	student27	the nic will
2006-07-06T12:07:00.000Z	sys8976	student27	network interface card
2006-07-06T12:07:00.000Z	sys8976	student27	it sounds like the install isnt picking up the nic that is in that machine...
2006-07-06T12:09:00.000Z	sys8976	student27	that just means you got a through put line (each end is seeing the other) however if on the install the os isnt seeing the nic then it isnt going to pull dhcp like it should
2006-07-06T12:10:00.000Z	sys8976	student27	hardware (nic) needs the right drivers (software) to work or it wont that it just the life of a pc
2006-07-06T12:11:00.000Z	sys8976	student27	yes test with another nic would be the first step,
