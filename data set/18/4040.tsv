2010-11-24T22:07:00.000Z	gnat_x	PeterOyore	do you mean your workspaces?
2010-11-24T22:11:00.000Z	gnat_x	PeterOyore	right click on your panel. select add to panel. look for workspace switcher
2010-11-24T22:11:00.000Z	gnat_x	PeterOyore	then fiddle the prefrences to your liking
2010-11-24T22:13:00.000Z	gnat_x	PeterOyore	i mean just the thing that lists what apps you have open.
2010-11-24T22:14:00.000Z	gnat_x	PeterOyore	by default its on the top and bottom.
2010-11-24T22:14:00.000Z	PeterOyore	gnat_x	Where is that
2010-11-24T22:15:00.000Z	PeterOyore	gnat_x	bottom is blank grey strip
2010-11-24T22:15:00.000Z	gnat_x	PeterOyore	yup. right click that.
2010-11-24T22:16:00.000Z	PeterOyore	gnat_x	panel info upon rt click no switcher to be seen?
2010-11-24T22:17:00.000Z	gnat_x	PeterOyore	in the add to panel window there's no workspace switcher?
2010-11-24T22:18:00.000Z	PeterOyore	gnat_x	and when I minimize a window it's gone from view?
2010-11-24T22:19:00.000Z	PeterOyore	gnat_x	Ahhh THAT did it  Thanks
2010-11-24T22:19:00.000Z	gnat_x	PeterOyore	it sounds like your panel gor borked. you might want to add Window list as well (then minimize will work)
2010-11-24T22:20:00.000Z	PeterOyore	gnat_x	Ok window list
2010-11-24T22:22:00.000Z	PeterOyore	gnat_x	  Borked indeed That worked just fine can see all. now .thanks a BUNCH!
