2007-02-15T07:52:00.000Z	TheShrewdDude		Hey guys... I just downloaded a .RUN file.
2007-02-15T07:52:00.000Z	TheShrewdDude		I have no idea what to do with it.
2007-02-15T07:52:00.000Z	TheShrewdDude		Any suggestions?
2007-02-15T07:52:00.000Z	shatrat	TheShrewdDude	what are you trying to install?
2007-02-15T07:52:00.000Z	TheShrewdDude	shatrat	OK, so it's an install file?
2007-02-15T07:53:00.000Z	TheShrewdDude	shatrat	What can I do with it? :P
2007-02-15T07:53:00.000Z	shatrat	TheShrewdDude	whenever possible, try and get things from repositories, anything installed from a .run isnt gonna get updates
2007-02-15T07:53:00.000Z	shatrat	TheShrewdDude	well, you downloaded it...what is it?
2007-02-15T07:53:00.000Z	TheShrewdDude	shatrat	I tried that... I couldn't find it via synaptic :(
2007-02-15T07:53:00.000Z	TheShrewdDude	shatrat	It's tremulous.
2007-02-15T07:53:00.000Z	TheShrewdDude	shatrat	So now I have a 100-MB thing sitting on my desktop and I can't do anything with it.
2007-02-15T07:53:00.000Z	shatrat	TheShrewdDude	ah, yes that is definitely in the repos.  You probably need to enable universe and multiverse repos though.
2007-02-15T07:54:00.000Z	shatrat	TheShrewdDude	/msg ubotu universe and the bot will PM you instructions
2007-02-15T07:54:00.000Z	TheShrewdDude	shatrat	Well, how would I go about installing this .RUN file?
2007-02-15T07:55:00.000Z	shatrat	TheShrewdDude	like I said before, thats kind of a last resort for installing things, because if it installs that way i tmight not install to the proper locations and it wont update automatically.  If you enable universe and multiverse, youll be able to apt-get install tremulous
2007-02-15T07:55:00.000Z	TheShrewdDude	shatrat	Well, ok, thanks.
2007-02-15T07:56:00.000Z	shatrat	TheShrewdDude	trust me, you'll be saving headaches if you install from universe repositories.  it creates ane ntry for it in yoru Applications menu and everything :)
2007-02-15T07:58:00.000Z	shatrat	TheShrewdDude	its as easy as checking a few checkboxes or deleting a couple #s from a text file.
