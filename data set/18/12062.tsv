2006-05-29T15:37:00.000Z	skippy81		did it?
2006-05-29T15:37:00.000Z	skippy81		if it did then restore the partition with test disk
2006-05-29T15:39:00.000Z	skippy81		oh and someone, please tell me how i automatically put a name of a user into IRC to save me typing it?
2006-05-29T15:39:00.000Z	skippy81		there must be a key-click combo to do it, im using xirc
2006-05-29T15:40:00.000Z	amphi	skippy81	type a few letters and hit [tab] 
2006-05-29T15:41:00.000Z	amphi	skippy81	;)

2006-06-04T15:15:00.000Z	amphi	skippy81	tab-completion appears not to be as discoverable as one might think
2006-06-04T15:16:00.000Z	skippy81	amphi	hehe not with your name, theres an amphi_ here as well :)

2006-06-04T15:26:00.000Z	amphi	skippy81	what about dual reciursive acronyms like Hurd ? :)
2006-06-04T15:27:00.000Z	amphi	skippy81	'Hird of UNIX Replacing Daemons'; Hird stands for 'Hurd of Interfaces Representing Depth' IIRC
2006-06-04T15:27:00.000Z	skippy81	amphi	they should be arrested for that :)
2006-06-04T15:27:00.000Z	amphi	skippy81	heh

2006-06-04T15:41:00.000Z	skippy81	amphi	nah he has some sort of lifethreatening infection, but recovered from it - left the distro in a mess though - slackware still hasnt revocered
2006-06-04T15:41:00.000Z	amphi	skippy81	oh, cool, so he's back in action again, at least
