2007-04-26T05:44:00.000Z	ebbs		again, hi, Im a network administrator of a school, we've got a linux Internet(Squid)/Fileserver(nfs). We just upgraded half of the clients to ubuntu feisty and now if a few feisty clients are running, they become very, very slow. Things like opening the gnome-terminal last half a minute... Why that? (We work with LDAP Auth.)
2007-04-26T05:45:00.000Z	burwaco	ebbs	do the system fans kick in after a while ? like the system is doing a huge compile job and runs out of memory and resources ?
2007-04-26T05:46:00.000Z	ebbs	burwaco	it doesnt run out of memory, and the processor isnt used too much, so no...
2007-04-26T05:47:00.000Z	burwaco	ebbs	looks like I have a similar problem... top doesn't show any active tasks, enough memory, no cpu activity, yet the system acts like it's about to explode...
2007-04-26T05:48:00.000Z	ebbs	burwaco	yes, exactly
2007-04-26T05:48:00.000Z	burwaco	ebbs	 what graphical cards are you using ?

2007-04-26T05:53:00.000Z	ebbs	burwaco	dont know, we made one client with all upgrades, and copied this on all the clients
2007-04-26T05:53:00.000Z	ebbs	burwaco	a week ago...

2007-04-26T05:58:00.000Z	ebbs	burwaco	thx
2007-04-26T06:31:00.000Z	ebbs	burwaco	zeroday , that was the problem, it was a miscofigured /etc/hosts, edgy accepted this misconfiguration and that had no influence on the system
