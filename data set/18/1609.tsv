2011-01-15T20:15:00.000Z	uth		I have no sound
2011-01-15T20:15:00.000Z	KM0201	uth	well, thats because ubuntu 10.4 doesn't exist.. you're using an unknown version

2011-01-15T20:18:00.000Z	KM0201	uth	LTS, doesn't mean it's alwasy the most up to date, there's a big difference
2011-01-15T20:19:00.000Z	KM0201	uth	well, your sound isn't working...
2011-01-15T20:22:00.000Z	KM0201	uth	i don't know... if your sound isn't working w/ alsa 1.0.23   and sound is important to you, then you need to figure out what is wrong... that's a fairly enw chipset, so I would runt he live cd of 10.10, and see if my sound worked
2011-01-15T20:22:00.000Z	KM0201	uth	both threads i've saw on this, suggests alsa 1.0.23 fixes the problem... are you using 32 or 64bit
2011-01-15T20:29:00.000Z	uth	KM0201	my chipset is AMD Phenom(tm) II X2 550 Processor, I don't know more
2011-01-15T20:30:00.000Z	KM0201	uth	what do you mean?...
2011-01-15T20:30:00.000Z	uth	KM0201	64 or 32 ?
2011-01-15T20:30:00.000Z	KM0201	uth	how much ram does your pc have?
2011-01-15T20:32:00.000Z	KM0201	uth	if you don't know which to choose, just choose 32bit... it's safe on anything.
2011-01-15T20:34:00.000Z	KM0201	uth	what are you trying to do?... i thought you said you alread upgraded alsa
2011-01-15T20:35:00.000Z	KM0201	uth	yes what?   you have alsa 1.0.23, and your sound still isn't working?
2011-01-15T20:36:00.000Z	uth	KM0201	 yes.  My hardware is too new ?
2011-01-15T20:37:00.000Z	KM0201	uth	... i'd suggest trying 10.10.. id on't know how much more clear i can be, but all those posts, suggest upgrading to alsa will fix it
