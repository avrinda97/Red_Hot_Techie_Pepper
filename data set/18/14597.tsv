2006-06-07T11:09:00.000Z	zer0		so basically I wanted to know how I can either restore the config files or find out what failsafe mode does differently
2006-06-07T11:10:00.000Z	zer0		hey icky, welcome to my nightmare
2006-06-07T11:10:00.000Z	zer0		my gnome works PERFECT in failsafe mode, all my customizations, programs I set to run at startup, etc
2006-06-07T11:11:00.000Z	zer0		heres the thing, I created a new user, test, and test has the same exact problem
2006-06-07T11:13:00.000Z	zer0		*whitynz
2006-06-07T11:14:00.000Z	zer0		so no one can think of anything that failsafe mode does differently from normal startup that wouldn't be specific to my home directory?
2006-06-07T11:14:00.000Z	zer0		vi?
2006-06-07T11:15:00.000Z	zer0		it has been there for a 100 years, will be there for a 100 more, and it's on any unix I can imagine running
2006-06-07T11:16:00.000Z	zer0		vi, vim same thing really, if you can manage your way around one you can manage your way around the other
2006-06-07T11:17:00.000Z	zer0		so anyways, I am considering doing a `apt-get -y remove gnome && apt-get -y install gnome`, anyone wanna tell me why this is probably a really stupid idea (or not) I have only been using a debian based distro for about a week now
2006-06-07T11:18:00.000Z	nickrud	zer0	mainly because gnome is a meta-package, and not the right meta-package for ubuntu
2006-06-07T11:21:00.000Z	nickrud	zer0	the gnome package you see is a holdover from debian; ubuntu uses ubuntu-desktop to install the equivalent system
2006-06-07T11:23:00.000Z	nickrud	zer0	if you do do apt-cache depends gnome (list what packages are installed by the gnome meta-package) and compare that to apt-cache depends ubuntu-desktop, you'll see two ways of using debian package management
2006-06-07T11:25:00.000Z	nickrud	zer0	depends on what you're trying to fix, and I couldn't look up that far
2006-06-07T11:27:00.000Z	zer0	nickrud	so what your saying is i could use apt get to remove and re-install either gnome or ubuntu-desktop, which are both going to affect different config files and binaries ? I think>
2006-06-07T11:28:00.000Z	nickrud	zer0	you ever use aptitude?
2006-06-07T11:30:00.000Z	nickrud	zer0	no. The only way I know of to completely remove gnome (and then reinstall it) is to use debfoster.
2006-06-07T11:31:00.000Z	nickrud	zer0	but personally I'd reinstall rather than use debfoster
