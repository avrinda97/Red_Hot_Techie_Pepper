2011-11-02T19:35:00.000Z	mathgirl		Aw, man.  I've got to alter grub.  This is always how I end up bricking stuff...
2011-11-02T19:35:00.000Z	theadmin	mathgirl	Hey, don't worry, we all do it :D
2011-11-02T21:57:00.000Z	theadmin	mathgirl	tmux is much better than screen, I suggest you try that :D
2011-11-02T21:58:00.000Z	mathgirl	theadmin	Every time I've tried to get it going, I haven't gotten any advantages over screen which I've got a nice screenrc for.
2011-11-02T21:58:00.000Z	theadmin	mathgirl	Ah, makes sense then.
2011-11-02T22:31:00.000Z	theadmin	mathgirl	Why is that blacklisted?
2011-11-02T22:32:00.000Z	theadmin	mathgirl	grep "blacklist nvidia_current" /etc/modprobe.d/*.conf -- find that line, remove it.
2011-11-02T22:32:00.000Z	mathgirl	theadmin	Maybe because that's what it took to get this mac to work back in Lucid?
2011-11-02T22:32:00.000Z	theadmin	mathgirl	Prolly, who knows
2011-11-02T22:33:00.000Z	theadmin	mathgirl	Also, run "sudo nvidia-xconfig" to configure X to use the nvidia module
2011-11-02T22:39:00.000Z	mathgirl	theadmin	The file /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist-local.conf contains only one line: blacklist nvidia_current
2011-11-02T22:39:00.000Z	theadmin	mathgirl	You can either delete that file, or just remove the line
2011-11-02T22:40:00.000Z	theadmin	mathgirl	Yeah, I think you can -- after that run the xconfig thingo and reboot
2011-11-02T22:41:00.000Z	theadmin	mathgirl	You should restart, or, well, you can also "sudo modprobe nvidia_current" and then startx
2011-11-02T22:46:00.000Z	theadmin	mathgirl	Congratulations :) Glad you solved it!
2011-11-02T22:47:00.000Z	mathgirl	theadmin	You and others here solved it!
2011-11-02T22:48:00.000Z	theadmin	mathgirl	lolol... That's not a major problem tho :D
2011-11-02T22:49:00.000Z	theadmin	mathgirl	No problem, glad you made it really :)
