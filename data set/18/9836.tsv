2007-02-17T15:04:00.000Z	daum		hey guys, quick question, is the ubuntu install easy for a person new to linux?
2007-02-17T15:04:00.000Z	hossasaur	daum	yes
2007-02-17T15:04:00.000Z	daum	hossasaur	it mostly graphical?
2007-02-17T15:05:00.000Z	hossasaur	daum	yes, but you should know what you're doing before getting into it
2007-02-17T15:05:00.000Z	hossasaur	daum	the most confuzing part, imo, is knowing how to set up partitions
2007-02-17T15:05:00.000Z	hossasaur	daum	good
2007-02-17T15:05:00.000Z	daum	hossasaur	it use a graphical client for that or fdisk command line?
2007-02-17T15:06:00.000Z	hossasaur	daum	graphical, though i'd highly suggest using windows-based partition software if he's resizing an ntfs partition with vista on it
2007-02-17T15:06:00.000Z	hossasaur	daum	ext3 or ext2
2007-02-17T15:07:00.000Z	daum	hossasaur	aye you have a reccomendation for whta type of software to resize his ntfs with(xp windows)
2007-02-17T15:07:00.000Z	hossasaur	daum	i say ext3 first because that's the one he should use
2007-02-17T15:07:00.000Z	hossasaur	daum	partition magic
2007-02-17T15:07:00.000Z	hossasaur	daum	well, eh, use a dos-based partition program
2007-02-17T15:07:00.000Z	hossasaur	daum	something that's good with ntfs
2007-02-17T15:08:00.000Z	daum	hossasaur	ok thanks
2007-02-17T15:08:00.000Z	hossasaur	daum	partition magic works well in xp, i'm not sure if they have a vista-compatible version yet
2007-02-17T15:09:00.000Z	hossasaur	daum	but if he's resizing an ntfs partition with vista on it in gparted (graphical partition software on the ubuntu live cd), it will corrupt the partition and he'll have to re-install vista, and then re-install grub
2007-02-17T15:09:00.000Z	hossasaur	daum	otherwise, very easy install, as easy as xp
