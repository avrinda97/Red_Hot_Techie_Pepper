2007-08-03T10:09:00.000Z	defcon_		I have /home owned as a user, who is supposed to own this dir
2007-08-03T10:09:00.000Z	MajorPayne	defcon_	root.
2007-08-03T10:10:00.000Z	defcon_	MajorPayne	astro76 thankyou, I need a cmd to run to fix my /home permissions every file is owned by one user and not there own
2007-08-03T10:10:00.000Z	MajorPayne	defcon_	chown root:root /home
2007-08-03T10:11:00.000Z	defcon_	MajorPayne	yes I know, /home/* is owned by one user now
2007-08-03T10:11:00.000Z	MajorPayne	defcon_	I don't understand.  A file/directory can only be owned by one user.
2007-08-03T10:11:00.000Z	MajorPayne	defcon_	Ohh, you mean that the home directorys are owned by other users?  You will have to chown each one.
2007-08-03T10:12:00.000Z	MajorPayne	defcon_	Like, if a user named moo should own /home/moo, do chown -R moo:moo /home/moo
2007-08-03T10:13:00.000Z	defcon_	MajorPayne	thankyou
2007-08-03T10:15:00.000Z	defcon_	MajorPayne	ok, my permissions via chmod for each user are screwed up, gnome wont let me in any user, what is the default permission for all files in /home/"user"
2007-08-03T10:16:00.000Z	MajorPayne	defcon_	I don't understand waht you mean by default permission.
2007-08-03T10:16:00.000Z	defcon_	MajorPayne	when I login gnome it kicks me out saying you must chmod 644 .dmrc and I do so and it still dont work
2007-08-03T10:18:00.000Z	MajorPayne	defcon_	That's a hard question.  Some should be 644, some should be 755, some should be 600.
2007-08-03T10:18:00.000Z	MajorPayne	defcon_	The directory by default should be 755, or 700.
2007-08-03T10:19:00.000Z	defcon_	MajorPayne	thankyou
2007-08-03T10:22:00.000Z	MajorPayne	defcon_	It may be easier to re-create the users.
2007-08-03T10:22:00.000Z	defcon_	MajorPayne	nah I fixed it thankyou bro
2007-08-03T10:22:00.000Z	MajorPayne	defcon_	Ok, good.
