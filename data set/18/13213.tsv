2006-01-10T08:46:00.000Z	WebLOCH		hello
2006-01-10T08:46:00.000Z	WebLOCH		Anyone here having trouble with java 1.5 and azureus?
2006-01-10T08:47:00.000Z	lowman62	WebLOCH	yes I had probs with it...then tossed it...and use the BitTorrent client that comes with ubuntu...works for me
2006-01-10T08:47:00.000Z	WebLOCH	lowman62	its nice but ... i like the DHT
2006-01-10T08:49:00.000Z	lowman62	WebLOCH	I know what you mean...but it was so mem intensive and never really closed properly...was poorly programmed javajunk as I call it
2006-01-10T08:49:00.000Z	WebLOCH	lowman62	its a mixture of azureus bugs and java bugs
2006-01-10T08:50:00.000Z	lowman62	WebLOCH	as a programmer I know bugs are inevitable but I rather wait on some apps to mature more before using them
2006-01-10T08:51:00.000Z	WebLOCH	lowman62	agreed, thats how i feel about firefox haha
2006-01-10T08:51:00.000Z	WebLOCH	lowman62	how long does the client normally take to kick  in on a download?
2006-01-10T08:51:00.000Z	WebLOCH	lowman62	think i have my answer, tracker timeout
2006-01-10T08:52:00.000Z	lowman62	WebLOCH	azureus or the BitTorrent client for ubuntu?
2006-01-10T08:52:00.000Z	lowman62	WebLOCH	ya that will do it too LOL :P
2006-01-10T08:52:00.000Z	WebLOCH	lowman62	i was using gnomebtdownload just now
2006-01-10T08:52:00.000Z	WebLOCH	lowman62	but after 60seconds it informed me the tracker is down
2006-01-10T08:54:00.000Z	lowman62	WebLOCH	I know it is rather lacking in functionality from my point of view but...it still works and you can set it to time out sooner if you like...that is what i did...am impatient LOL :P
2006-01-10T08:54:00.000Z	WebLOCH	lowman62	this is obscene, azureus was running fine under 1.5
2006-01-10T08:56:00.000Z	lowman62	WebLOCH	to me although java has come a long way...I do believe it is still in its infancy stage as of yet...although I do get amused by their versioning numbers...have you figured that one out yet? LOL :P
2006-01-10T08:56:00.000Z	WebLOCH	lowman62	yeah its plain awful
