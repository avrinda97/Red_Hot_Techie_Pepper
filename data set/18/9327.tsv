2009-04-06T20:27:00.000Z	Joyce_		Jng, without it my program does't work
2009-04-06T20:27:00.000Z	Joyce_		but since the ip changes, it still gives problem
2009-04-06T20:28:00.000Z	Joyce_		ok thanks a lot.
2009-04-06T20:28:00.000Z	usser	Joyce_	just get the dyndns client for linux, it'll keep your hostname up to date
2009-04-06T20:28:00.000Z	Joyce_		thanks a lot for the help. I will try with my dyndns hostname
2009-04-06T20:29:00.000Z	Joyce_		Thanks a lot Pici. That will give me much more control than using DynDns. Thanks a lot to all for the help :)
2009-04-06T20:30:00.000Z	Joyce_		btw, is it possible to know my client ip when logged in to my ssh server?
2009-04-06T20:31:00.000Z	Joyce_		I tried to get it from whatismyip.org, but I am getting the ip of my server
2009-04-06T20:32:00.000Z	Joyce_		who doen't help much since it shows all the current logged in sessions.
2009-04-06T20:33:00.000Z	Joyce_	tux_	is SSH_CONNECTION a env variable?
2009-04-06T20:33:00.000Z	Joyce_		$SSH_CONNECTION is empty for me

2009-04-06T20:34:00.000Z	usser	Joyce_	tail /var/log/auth.log
2009-04-06T20:34:00.000Z	Joyce_		is is possible to get only the current session from who?
2009-04-06T20:34:00.000Z	Joyce_	tux_	yes
2009-04-06T20:35:00.000Z	Joyce_		tail: cannot open `/var/log/auth.log' for reading: No such file or directory
