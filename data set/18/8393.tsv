2012-09-23T23:04:00.000Z	praveen_	obi	how can i check mbr?
2012-09-23T23:05:00.000Z	obi	praveen_	sudo fdisk -l
2012-09-23T23:09:00.000Z	obi	praveen_	sudo ms-sys -m /dev/sda
2012-09-23T23:14:00.000Z	obi	praveen_	Hmmm, one minute

2012-09-23T23:23:00.000Z	obi	praveen_	reboot?
2012-09-23T23:32:00.000Z	obi	praveen_	sh*t, i guess i am at a loss. I will keep searching thinking. What does it show for available devices? This a fresh install?
2012-09-23T23:33:00.000Z	praveen_	obi	It shows the available devices as cd drive, network boot and HDD. Yes, its a fresh install.
2012-09-23T23:34:00.000Z	obi	praveen_	No, I mean when running sudo fdisk -l
2012-09-23T23:36:00.000Z	obi	praveen_	open a terminal and enter "sudo fdisk -l" and tell me what devices are shown
2012-09-23T23:37:00.000Z	obi	praveen_	we are looking for your main partition /dev/sda(x)
2012-09-23T23:39:00.000Z	obi	praveen_	which has the most blocks and what is listed under it's system
2012-09-23T23:43:00.000Z	obi	praveen_	ok, enter sudo ms-sys -m /dev/sda2 and restart
2012-09-23T23:45:00.000Z	obi	praveen_	yes, that is the same message I got when I did this last week and i proceeded
2012-09-23T23:45:00.000Z	obi	praveen_	I know this problem/solution only from my experience, not from knowledge lol
2012-09-23T23:56:00.000Z	praveen_	obi	Thanks for your help!
2012-09-23T23:58:00.000Z	obi	praveen_	I wasn't much help, but sure :)
