2009-04-22T23:14:00.000Z	Rolie	ShinyHat	find is case sensitive
2009-04-22T23:14:00.000Z	ShinyHat		i have been using the search button :|
2009-04-22T23:15:00.000Z	ShinyHat		perhaps that is not the right way to search?
2009-04-22T23:16:00.000Z	ShinyHat	lightpriest_	i mounted them to a folder in /home
2009-04-22T23:16:00.000Z	Rolie	ShinyHat	did you search on *.ext? Because "the search button" does not seem to support wildcards
2009-04-22T23:17:00.000Z	ShinyHat		rolie: that would probably be my issue, then
2009-04-22T23:17:00.000Z	ShinyHat	lightpriest_	it appears, but as rolie just mentioned the search feature doesn't seem to support wildcards
2009-04-22T23:18:00.000Z	ShinyHat		rolie: so how do i search for all files of a type?
2009-04-22T23:18:00.000Z	Rolie	ShinyHat	oke, then you should open a command line, cd to the mount point and use find: find . -iname *.ext
2009-04-22T23:19:00.000Z	ShinyHat		rolie: that seems a bit cumbersome to, for example, display all mp4s in a folder
2009-04-22T23:20:00.000Z	Rolie	ShinyHat	or just search (with the button :)) without a wildcard, but I don't know whether that would give too much false positives...
2009-04-22T23:20:00.000Z	Rolie	ShinyHat	because as far as I know there is no such feature to search for specific file types (extensions) within Nautilus
2009-04-22T23:22:00.000Z	ShinyHat		rolie: i guess i've been locked into windows too long- failing to see the obvious, simple solution. searching mp3 gave exactly what i was after
2009-04-22T23:22:00.000Z	ShinyHat		rolie: i kinda feel silly now:-/
2009-04-22T23:23:00.000Z	ShinyHat	lightpriest_	thanks for that also. maybe after enough linux experience i will get it through my head that it doesnt have to be as difficult as i was used to
2009-04-22T23:23:00.000Z	Rolie	ShinyHat	:) But as I see now, there Ã­s a way. Hard to explain but after searching I get a sort of yellow bar in which I can add / remove search conditions amongst which I can specify a file type..., as lightpriest_ mentioned
2009-04-22T23:25:00.000Z	ShinyHat	lightpriest_	rolie: thank you both for the help!
2009-04-22T23:25:00.000Z	Rolie	ShinyHat	np!
