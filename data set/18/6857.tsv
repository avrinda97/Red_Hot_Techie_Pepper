2008-04-13T09:06:00.000Z	Cpudan80	ltcabral	FYI about ##C --- only ask stuff in there if you are really stuck and have read the manual
2008-04-13T09:07:00.000Z	Cpudan80	ltcabral	They dont like newb questions at all -- somewhat unfortunate
2008-04-13T09:07:00.000Z	ltcabral	Cpudan80	well they were very nice to me last time.. and it wasnt that noob question... :)
2008-04-13T09:08:00.000Z	Cpudan80	ltcabral	They yelled at me for asking something about a thread, and then came to the conclusion that I didnt know structs or points
2008-04-13T09:09:00.000Z	ltcabral	Cpudan80	oh well... maybe google should be always our first option :)
2008-04-13T09:09:00.000Z	Cpudan80	ltcabral	True
2008-04-13T09:10:00.000Z	Cpudan80	ltcabral	What address are you binding to?
2008-04-13T09:10:00.000Z	ltcabral	Cpudan80	localhost
2008-04-13T09:10:00.000Z	Cpudan80	ltcabral	What port
2008-04-13T09:11:00.000Z	ltcabral	Cpudan80	it was working few minutes ago... then i got this error.... i open server and when i open client it gives me the error
2008-04-13T09:13:00.000Z	ltcabral	Cpudan80	so any idea?
2008-04-13T09:14:00.000Z	Cpudan80	ltcabral	Not really ---- you aren't binding multiple times are you?
2008-04-13T09:14:00.000Z	Cpudan80	ltcabral	Sometimes if the program does not end cleanly, you get those bind errors
2008-04-13T09:16:00.000Z	ltcabral	Cpudan80	ya i know.. i know most cases that this problem can happen but not how to fix it :T
2008-04-13T09:17:00.000Z	ltcabral	Cpudan80	nop... just 1 client... i think its because i closed to server before closing the client... anyways not even a restart fixed it
