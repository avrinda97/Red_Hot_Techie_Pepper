2009-04-25T12:12:00.000Z	losher	Flannel	people running ext3 (myself included) have remarked that 9.04 feels slightly slower than 8.X
2009-04-28T08:49:00.000Z	losher	Flannel	was that addressed to me?
2009-04-28T08:49:00.000Z	Flannel	losher	Among others.
2009-04-28T08:51:00.000Z	losher	Flannel	I object to your accusation of being off-topic. I think it's very on-topic to point out that just because some tech guy says it;s good is a poor reason to wipe windows off your hard drive and install Ubuntu
2009-05-14T11:12:00.000Z	Flannel	losher	This isn't the place for it.  Try #ubuntu-ops or #ubuntu-offtopic, thanks.
2009-05-14T11:12:00.000Z	losher	Flannel	fair enough.
2009-05-22T04:45:00.000Z	Flannel	losher	We've always had a no-away message policy.
2009-05-22T04:46:00.000Z	losher	Flannel	good to know. I never realised...
2009-06-02T08:42:00.000Z	losher	Flannel	diamadiaz: seriously? You can't reinstall grub from the live cd?
2009-06-02T08:43:00.000Z	Flannel	losher	He wants to install a CLI-only system. Not GRUB.  Yes, you can install GRUB from a liveCD
2009-06-02T08:46:00.000Z	losher	Flannel	diamadiaz: is that right, diamadaz: you're trying to install a cli-only system?
2009-07-26T10:42:00.000Z	Flannel	losher	And you hit ctrl-D....
2009-07-26T10:43:00.000Z	losher	Flannel	won't ctrl-d take to to multi-user mode?
2009-07-26T10:43:00.000Z	Flannel	losher	No.  It even mentions that you either type the root password, or if you don't have one, hit ctrl-d
2009-07-26T10:44:00.000Z	losher	Flannel	in that case, I withdraw my objection...
2009-08-29T00:48:00.000Z	Flannel	losher	Well, it's less radical than just installing the 5.8 package from hardy and removing the one from jaunty.  And it is reversible.
2009-10-02T05:07:00.000Z	Flannel	losher	While there's some truth to that, it's not entirely accurate.  For example, during the alpha stage, there's no guarantee for stability, so massive changes to core stuff gets pushed all the time and things break daily.  During this stage, there's increased expectations of things to break less, so people will be less likely to break things.
2009-10-02T05:10:00.000Z	losher	Flannel	sebsebseb: I don't disagree with you all. And deciding when something is 'ready' is a judgement call too. It's kind of a balancing act, and depends on what mix of stability & new features one is comfortable with. Personally, I'm an 8.04 fan...
