2012-06-14T09:21:00.000Z	pb3	daslinkard	you been using ubuntu for a while?
2012-06-14T09:21:00.000Z	daslinkard	pb3	I have been using it since November....this is my 3rd time utilizing freenode
2012-06-14T09:22:00.000Z	pb3	daslinkard	sweet man. what version of ubuntu are you on atm
2012-06-14T09:23:00.000Z	daslinkard	pb3	11.10....I went up to 12.04 on my desktop but had A LOT of system freezes
2012-06-14T09:23:00.000Z	pb3	daslinkard	yeah I am on 10.04 (LinuxMint 9 actually). I tried 12, but didn't care for the new desktop.
2012-06-14T09:24:00.000Z	daslinkard	pb3	I was the exact same way....right now there seems to be too many bugs in the system...when does the support run out for 10.04?
2012-06-14T09:25:00.000Z	pb3	daslinkard	April 2013 i think (I know it's 2013)
2012-06-14T09:26:00.000Z	daslinkard	pb3	I was thinking you were on Ubuntu....if I'm not mistaken have they stopped supporting Ubuntu 10.04?
2012-06-14T09:28:00.000Z	pb3	daslinkard	yeah I started with ubunt about 5 years ago, but switched over to mint 2 years later (Mint 6). I like it because it's a bit more polished but I can use all the ubuntu packages, etc.
2012-06-14T09:29:00.000Z	daslinkard	pb3	I started with Mint Julia and loved it for the brief time that I used it but then decided to switch to Ubuntu after speaking more and more with one of my friends
2012-06-14T09:30:00.000Z	pb3	daslinkard	Oh sweet. Yeah I love Isadora. What specifically made you want to switch back?
2012-06-14T09:31:00.000Z	daslinkard	pb3	The biggest thing was the peer pressure to be with the rest of them
2012-06-14T09:32:00.000Z	pb3	daslinkard	lol. yeah I can get that.
2012-06-14T09:32:00.000Z	daslinkard	pb3	Now I'm trying to become fluent in Linux....trying to work the CLI...I've thought about going to Fedora for the similarity in RHEL
2012-06-14T09:33:00.000Z	daslinkard	pb3	I've got 15 years of Windows experience and it is sometimes frustrating not necessarily alwaysk knowing the answers to the issues...but Google is my friend...and the forums.
