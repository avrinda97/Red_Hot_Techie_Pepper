2011-02-26T15:58:00.000Z	newlinux		what command to download and install aptoncd? sudo apt-get???
2011-02-26T15:58:00.000Z	bazhang	newlinux	install it and then launch from application
2011-02-26T16:00:00.000Z	bazhang	newlinux	what version of ubuntu , be sure that the repo is enabled in synaptic
2011-02-26T16:04:00.000Z	newlinux	bazhang	10.10
2011-02-26T16:04:00.000Z	bazhang	newlinux	then update sources.list as suggested above and make sure all the necessary repos are enabled in synaptic package manager
2011-02-26T16:05:00.000Z	bazhang	newlinux	apt-cache search aptoncd after that
2011-02-26T16:06:00.000Z	newlinux	bazhang	where to find if repo is enabled or not in synaptic?
2011-02-26T16:07:00.000Z	bazhang	newlinux	did you update sources.list? sudo apt-get update
2011-02-26T16:08:00.000Z	bazhang	newlinux	cat /etc/apt/sources.list ---> paste.ubuntu.com
2011-02-26T16:09:00.000Z	bazhang	newlinux	let it finish
2011-02-26T16:18:00.000Z	newlinux	bazhang	aptoncd developers must provide their product available offline on produced disk's! am I right?!!
2011-02-26T16:26:00.000Z	bazhang	newlinux	got ubuntu installed on another computer?
2011-02-26T16:26:00.000Z	newlinux	bazhang	yes
2011-02-26T16:27:00.000Z	bazhang	newlinux	its pretty self explanatory, its added as part of sources.list and then installed from there
2011-02-26T16:27:00.000Z	bazhang	newlinux	ie an offline repo
2011-02-26T16:28:00.000Z	newlinux	bazhang	can you explain more? what should I do?
2011-02-26T16:32:00.000Z	newlinux	bazhang	my aptoncd is different! for example no option for restoring from an iso file!
