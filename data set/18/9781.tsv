2008-01-09T02:28:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	reportingsjr	double clicking them usually works.
2008-01-09T02:29:00.000Z	reportingsjr	IndyGunFreak	Oh, I tried to open in through Fx :p
2008-01-09T02:29:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	reportingsjr	:)
2008-09-02T06:44:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	reportingsjr	yes.
2008-09-02T06:45:00.000Z	reportingsjr	IndyGunFreak	is there any way I can make it act like two x screens, like xinerama, so that way full screen isn't across all screens?
2008-09-02T06:45:00.000Z	reportingsjr	IndyGunFreak	or should I just switch to twinview when I want to play games and such across all screens?
2008-09-02T06:45:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	reportingsjr	yes, it should be an option under Nvidia-settings
2008-09-02T06:45:00.000Z	reportingsjr	IndyGunFreak	really, I didn't see it? what is it called?
2008-09-02T06:46:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	reportingsjr	... im not at my PC, i can't recall exactly
2008-09-02T06:46:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	reportingsjr	open nvidia-settings, select a monitor, and click "configure".. i think its under configure
2008-09-02T06:46:00.000Z	reportingsjr	IndyGunFreak	=\
2008-09-02T06:46:00.000Z	reportingsjr	IndyGunFreak	only a twinview option, plus two others there
2008-09-02T06:47:00.000Z	reportingsjr	IndyGunFreak	and.. separate x screen, but isn't that xinerama?
2008-09-02T06:49:00.000Z	reportingsjr	IndyGunFreak	bah, forget it. Non-fullscreen is probably better, anyways :)
2008-09-02T06:49:00.000Z	reportingsjr	IndyGunFreak	more adjustable windows!
