2007-04-08T11:28:00.000Z	task0		how do i STOP X?
2007-04-08T11:29:00.000Z	crdlb	task0	sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop
2007-04-27T16:50:00.000Z	crdlb	task0	you'll have to be more specific than that :)
2007-04-27T16:51:00.000Z	task0	crdlb	my monitor resolution and refreshrates are not detected... they where detected rigth on previous version...
2007-04-27T16:52:00.000Z	crdlb	task0	but it works otherwise?
2007-04-27T16:52:00.000Z	task0	crdlb	i cant set 1280x1024@75
2007-04-27T16:52:00.000Z	crdlb	task0	that's entirely a nvidia bug
2007-04-27T16:52:00.000Z	crdlb	task0	complain to them :)
2007-04-27T16:52:00.000Z	task0	crdlb	i cant ever set 1024x768@1001
2007-04-27T16:53:00.000Z	crdlb	task0	did you try using nvidia-settings ?
2007-04-27T16:53:00.000Z	task0	crdlb	will try after install... on version 6.10 i used nvidia bynaries, not the restricted one from ubuntu
2007-04-27T16:54:00.000Z	crdlb	task0	that won't make a difference
2007-04-27T16:54:00.000Z	crdlb	task0	it's the version not how you install them
2007-04-27T16:54:00.000Z	task0	crdlb	but now i cant set nvidia drivers to work
2007-04-27T16:54:00.000Z	crdlb	task0	make sure you try nvidia-glx-new if your card is at least the FX series
2007-04-27T16:54:00.000Z	task0	crdlb	no, its an old one Gf 4 Ti 4200
2007-04-27T16:55:00.000Z	crdlb	task0	since nvidia has dropped support, there's not much ubuntu can do :(
2007-04-27T16:55:00.000Z	task0	crdlb	so what driver should i use?
