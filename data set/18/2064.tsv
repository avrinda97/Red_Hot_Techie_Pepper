2010-08-28T18:42:00.000Z	Guest22962		how can I confirm if I have 32 or 64 bit?
2010-08-28T18:43:00.000Z	Guest22962		if it's i686 does that mean 32 bit?
2010-08-28T18:43:00.000Z	Guest22962		thanks
2010-08-28T18:43:00.000Z	jrib	Guest22962	that means your install is 32bit, not that your processor isn't capable of 64bit
2010-08-28T18:44:00.000Z	Guest22962	jrib	I caught that much
2010-08-28T18:44:00.000Z	jrib	Guest22962	k
2010-08-28T18:53:00.000Z	jrib	Guest22962	use lucid then
2010-08-28T18:53:00.000Z	jrib	Guest22962	or... https://edge.launchpad.net/~openoffice-pkgs/+archive/ppa but you're better off just upgrading to lucid
2010-08-28T18:54:00.000Z	Guest22962	jrib	in all reality, shouldn't one be able to use the version of OOo without having to upgrade/re-install the OS?
2010-08-28T18:54:00.000Z	jrib	Guest22962	of course you can.  But it's sub-optimal as its not in the official repositories
2010-08-28T18:55:00.000Z	Guest22962	jrib	define "sub-optimal"?
2010-08-28T18:55:00.000Z	jrib	Guest22962	"not in the official repositories"
2010-08-28T18:56:00.000Z	Guest22962	jrib	that doesn't say much. like, would functionality be missing would there be a problem with dependancies etc?
2010-08-28T18:59:00.000Z	jrib	Guest22962	it does say much... for one, if a package is in official repositories (as opposed to a ppa) it's likely to be better quality, get more exposure, and more likely to be supported in bug reports
2010-08-28T18:59:00.000Z	jrib	Guest22962	if something exists in official repositories, I would never use a ppa
2010-08-28T19:00:00.000Z	Guest22962	jrib	that doesn't tell me why.... is there a situation appropriate to use a ppa?
2010-08-28T19:01:00.000Z	jrib	Guest22962	yes, when something is not in the official repositories and you have a good reason to trust the author
2010-08-28T19:05:00.000Z	jrib	Guest22962	practically, you're probably fine with the ppa if you really don't want to upgrade.  But eventually you're going to upgrade anyway and it's better to use official repositories for the reasons above, so I would just upgrade to 10.04 and be done with it
