2004-10-23T10:55:00.000Z	C2H5OH		I only have one question I didn't find in the faq: does ubuntu come with prelink ?
2004-10-23T10:56:00.000Z	C2H5OH		I guess not
2004-10-23T10:56:00.000Z	Kamion	C2H5OH	no, we use a linker option which gets you most of the benefits of prelink without the management pain
2004-10-23T10:57:00.000Z	C2H5OH	Kamion	mmmm, interesting, where can I find information about that option?
2004-10-23T10:57:00.000Z	Kamion		it's -O1, look it up in the ld documentation
2004-10-23T10:57:00.000Z	C2H5OH		ok, thanks a lot :-*
2004-10-23T10:59:00.000Z	C2H5OH	Kamion	 by the way, is "capital o", right?
2004-10-23T10:59:00.000Z	C2H5OH		-O1
2004-10-23T10:59:00.000Z	C2H5OH		like the gcc -Ox options
2004-10-23T10:59:00.000Z	Kamion		yes
2004-10-23T11:00:00.000Z	C2H5OH		allright
2004-10-23T11:00:00.000Z	C2H5OH		is not in the man page
2004-10-23T11:00:00.000Z	C2H5OH		probably in the info manual
2004-10-23T11:00:00.000Z	Kamion		-O is in the man page, but it doesn't go into detail
2004-10-23T11:00:00.000Z	C2H5OH		ok
2004-10-23T11:00:00.000Z	C2H5OH		I found it ^_^
2004-10-23T11:01:00.000Z	Kamion	C2H5OH	try http://mail.gnome.org/archives/desktop-devel-list/2004-September/msg00377.html
2004-10-23T11:02:00.000Z	C2H5OH	Kamion	 that seems like the global optimizator, doesn't it ?
