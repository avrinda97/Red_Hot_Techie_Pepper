2011-05-13T04:26:00.000Z	uberfrau		hey guys, i'm a kubuntu user, but it's telling me to upgrade to Ubuntu 11.04, am i or will it mess with my stuff...?
2011-05-13T04:27:00.000Z	Octodigit	uberfrau	if it works, consider waiting and doing a clean install in some empty space
2011-05-13T04:27:00.000Z	Octodigit	uberfrau	I have upgraded and it's been an unmitigated disaster
2011-05-13T04:27:00.000Z	uberfrau		well what will it do..?
2011-05-13T04:27:00.000Z	uberfrau		so maybe i should wait?
2011-05-13T04:27:00.000Z	uberfrau		i don't want to clean install -_-
2011-05-13T04:28:00.000Z	uberfrau		hum
2011-05-13T04:28:00.000Z	uberfrau		kk
2011-05-13T04:28:00.000Z	Octodigit	uberfrau	if you're like me, it will break and leave you with no video and no sound capture
2011-05-13T04:28:00.000Z	uberfrau		lol
2011-05-13T04:28:00.000Z	uberfrau		i'm not in the mood to mess with Linux issues
2011-05-13T04:28:00.000Z	Octodigit	uberfrau	then unity where nothing appears, and gnome where everything flashes on and off
2011-05-13T04:28:00.000Z	Octodigit	uberfrau	and kernel panics on shutdown
2011-05-13T04:28:00.000Z	uberfrau		o_O
2011-05-13T04:29:00.000Z	uberfrau		i think i'll just wait...
2011-05-13T04:29:00.000Z	Octodigit	uberfrau	and when you work out it sort of works with compiz disabled, you'll discover firefox and some other things are really badly broken
2011-05-13T04:30:00.000Z	uberfrau	Octodigit	fuck that o_O
2011-05-13T04:30:00.000Z	Octodigit	uberfrau	and that when you try to record stuff your speakers screech really loudly so you're not sure but they might be broken
