2008-07-02T08:04:00.000Z	mercutio22		hello, I think I might be running into a problem here. I am trying to get a program called g15daemon to run on startup by following this http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=267118&highlight=g15daemon. I think I might have messed up with my sudoers file: http://www.pastebin.ca/1060139
2008-07-02T08:05:00.000Z	Fryguy--	mercutio22	do you have a question? or are you going to just keep pasting that
2008-07-02T08:06:00.000Z	mercutio22	Fryguy--	Alright, if you want more formally: "is that so"?
2008-07-02T08:06:00.000Z	Fryguy--	mercutio22	you pasted the output of a vi editing session, i have no idea what you are doing
2008-07-02T08:07:00.000Z	Fryguy--	mercutio22	ask a question, if the question is "did I mess up my sudoers file" then show us the sudoers file and we can check.  if you use visudo to edit it (like you are supposed to), then no you didn't mess up the sudoers file
2008-07-02T08:09:00.000Z	mercutio22	Fryguy--	Yeah, me too. I was trying to add a line to that "sudoers" file by following that tutorial. I never used vi before. Once I started trying to edit the file nothing happened and I pressed Q totry and quit and that "recording" line appeared. Can you help?
2008-07-02T08:09:00.000Z	Fryguy--	mercutio22	I can help, what do you want to do
2008-07-02T08:10:00.000Z	mercutio22	Fryguy--	Two things: I want to find out whether I borked the sudoers file and then I want to try and make that g15daemon program run on start up
2008-07-02T08:10:00.000Z	Fryguy--	mercutio22	if you still have the file open and you are trying to get out of it. just hit q again, and then hit :q! <enter>
2008-07-02T08:10:00.000Z	Fryguy--	mercutio22	if you use visudo to edit the sudoers file, then you can't mess it up
2008-07-02T08:11:00.000Z	mercutio22	Fryguy--	cool, I just read that from the man page. Now... I still can't quit the vi editor...
2008-07-02T08:11:00.000Z	Fryguy--	mercutio22	hit :q!
2008-07-02T08:13:00.000Z	mercutio22	Fryguy--	hmm ok. I had to add "!" after the q. An error message popped up saying nothing had been written
2008-07-02T08:14:00.000Z	Fryguy--	mercutio22	right
2008-07-02T08:15:00.000Z	mercutio22	Fryguy--	now, If I want to add that line to the sudoers file by inputing "sudo visudo" how can I start editing in vi?
2008-07-02T08:15:00.000Z	Fryguy--	mercutio22	hit 'i'
2008-07-02T08:15:00.000Z	Fryguy--	mercutio22	to put yourself into insert mode, and then you can type like normal
2008-07-02T08:15:00.000Z	mercutio22	Fryguy--	got it. Thanks
