2007-03-27T08:44:00.000Z	LRP		hello, I'm new to IRC and new to Ubuntu/Linux, can someone help me setup a share on my dual boot machine
2007-03-27T08:44:00.000Z	LRP		my share drive already has data on it and is accessible from Windows, it is FAT32, I mounted it as /mnt/share
2007-03-27T08:44:00.000Z	LRP		when I try to access it ther is nothing in the folder
2007-03-27T08:45:00.000Z	neozen	LRP	hmmmmmm

2007-03-27T08:49:00.000Z	neozen	LRP	and read
2007-03-27T08:49:00.000Z	LRP	neozen	I don't even know what fstab is, I just read about it earlier somewhere
2007-03-27T08:50:00.000Z	neozen	LRP	man fstab will tell you all you need to know
2007-03-27T08:53:00.000Z	neozen	LRP	it might be that its set up with the wrong permissions
2007-03-27T10:10:00.000Z	neozen	LRP	its the filemanager for ubuntu
