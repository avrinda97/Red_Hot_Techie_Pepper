2007-02-09T16:00:00.000Z	livingdaylight	kenthomson	see. there's lots of helpful people at ubuntu. Ubuntu rulez! ok?
2007-02-09T16:02:00.000Z	kenthomson	livingdaylight	mindlessly praising a distro that's simply borrowed stuff from the OS community is not good for anyone :)
2007-02-09T16:03:00.000Z	livingdaylight	kenthomson	who says i'm mindlessly praising? And who says im just prasing the os. I was referring to the awesome community that makes Ubuntu what it is
2007-02-09T16:04:00.000Z	livingdaylight	kenthomson	i bet you don't use Ubuntu
2007-02-09T16:04:00.000Z	livingdaylight	kenthomson	be honest, what do you use?
2007-02-09T16:05:00.000Z	livingdaylight	kenthomson	be honest because i can tell if you're lying... You don't even use UBuntu do you?
2007-02-09T16:05:00.000Z	livingdaylight	kenthomson	but you know the support is great here, so you come with your Firefox questions and dare to diss me
