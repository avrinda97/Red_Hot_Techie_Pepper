2012-05-15T17:34:00.000Z	lpapp		Hey! What is the default root password on a fresh 12.04 LTS installation ? I have the password working for the user, but I cannot use "su" with any passwords I had on the top of my mind.
2012-05-15T17:35:00.000Z	lpapp		same password works for the current user
2012-05-15T17:35:00.000Z	lpapp		even for sudo
2012-05-15T17:36:00.000Z	lpapp		and I was asked for only one password while creating the user during the installation.
2012-05-15T17:36:00.000Z	zykotick9	lpapp	have you changed your computer's name by chance?
2012-05-15T17:36:00.000Z	lpapp	zykotick9	from what ? It is a brand new installation
2012-05-15T17:36:00.000Z	zykotick9	lpapp	ok, not applicable then.
2012-05-15T17:38:00.000Z	zykotick9	lpapp	there is no root password on ubuntu - are you using ubuntu or something else?
2012-05-15T17:38:00.000Z	lpapp	zykotick9	Ubuntu 12.04 like I said.
2012-05-15T17:38:00.000Z	zykotick9	lpapp	sorry, you did say that.  my bad.
2012-05-15T17:40:00.000Z	zykotick9	lpapp	as the user you want to sudo with, in a terminal type "groups" - is admin listed?
2012-05-15T17:40:00.000Z	lpapp	zykotick9	there is an "adm"
2012-05-15T17:40:00.000Z	zykotick9	lpapp	not the same!
2012-05-15T17:41:00.000Z	lpapp	zykotick9	sorry ?
2012-05-15T17:41:00.000Z	zykotick9	lpapp	oh wait - in 12.04 the sudo group requirement might be different.  ignore me.
2012-05-15T17:42:00.000Z	zykotick9	lpapp	su shouldn't work - root password is not supported on ubuntu
2012-05-15T17:42:00.000Z	lpapp	zykotick9	it did work with the previous 12.04 installation fyi
2012-05-15T17:42:00.000Z	lpapp	zykotick9	though I have not created user at the time, but after the installation on the running system
