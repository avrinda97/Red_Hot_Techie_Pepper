2012-11-05T21:28:00.000Z	Chotaz		I know this is very brand/model specific but can anyone help me get a Brother MFCJ415W multifunction to work in Ubuntu 12.10?
2012-11-05T21:30:00.000Z	mr_david	Chotaz	did you check the Brother website? They provide Linux drivers
2012-11-05T21:33:00.000Z	Chotaz	mr_david	thanks for the tip, I just dont know what I should install http://welcome.solutions.brother.com/bsc/public_s/id/linux/en/download_prn.html#MFC-J415W
2012-11-05T21:36:00.000Z	mr_david	Chotaz	there are installation instructions on their site. it tells you exactly what to download and what commands to run to install
2012-11-05T21:43:00.000Z	Chotaz	mr_david	im trying to follow the websites instructions
2012-11-05T21:43:00.000Z	Chotaz	mr_david	but it asks me to run aa-complain which i dont have
2012-11-05T21:45:00.000Z	mr_david	Chotaz	which page are you looking at? I don't see that
2012-11-05T21:45:00.000Z	Chotaz	mr_david	http://welcome.solutions.brother.com/bsc/public_s/id/linux/en/before.html pre-procedure(2)
2012-11-05T21:46:00.000Z	mr_david	Chotaz	install apparmor-utils: /usr/sbin/aa-complain
2012-11-05T21:47:00.000Z	mr_david	Chotaz	aptitude search aa-complain did not return any results so I ran apt-file search aa-complain and it returned the above line
2012-11-05T21:55:00.000Z	Chotaz	mr_david	they say I should go with the CUPS driver if it enabled for my system, is that the case for Ubuntu 12.10?
2012-11-05T21:56:00.000Z	mr_david	Chotaz	is cupsd running on your system?
2012-11-05T21:57:00.000Z	Chotaz	mr_david	ps ax | grep "cups"
2012-11-05T21:57:00.000Z	mr_david	Chotaz	ps auxww | grep cupsd
2012-11-05T22:03:00.000Z	Chotaz	mr_david	http://welcome.solutions.brother.com/bsc/public_s/id/linux/en/before.html#003 I've followed this step blindly it is not needed for my model, how can I undo it?
2012-11-05T22:18:00.000Z	Chotaz	mr_david	thanks!
2012-11-05T22:18:00.000Z	Chotaz	mr_david	it works now =)
2012-11-05T22:29:00.000Z	mr_david	Chotaz	awesome, glad to hear it
