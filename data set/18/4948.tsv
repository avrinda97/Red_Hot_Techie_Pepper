2009-02-04T03:20:00.000Z	Baatti		Please Help, Ubuntu Emergency. I was following instructions for installing and testing 'Flashcam'... I did: tar xvf flashcam.tar.bz2... then moved to the directory...did: make, then did: sudo make install.  Then I had to do a few commands that I didn't understand the purpose really, things for configuring the cam. It looked like everything was going well, the light on my cam even cam on. Then I moved onto the 'testing' portion of the in
2009-02-04T03:20:00.000Z	Baatti		yeah well...
2009-02-04T03:21:00.000Z	Baatti		Ubottu, I'd love to go there, but I can't access anything on the web :(
2009-02-04T03:22:00.000Z	Baatti		ah
2009-02-04T03:23:00.000Z	Baatti		thank you redvamp128
2009-02-04T03:23:00.000Z	oCean_	Baatti	Is there just one user account on your system?
2009-02-04T03:23:00.000Z	Baatti	oCean_	 yes
2009-02-04T03:23:00.000Z	oCean_	Baatti	ok. A lot of settings regarding firefox is in your homedirectory /home/user/.mozilla
2009-02-04T03:24:00.000Z	Baatti	oCean_	ok, what should I be looking for specifically? any ideas?
2009-02-04T03:24:00.000Z	oCean_	Baatti	If you were to rename that directory (like mv .mozilla .saved_mozilla) from a firefox point of view, you would start that browser for the very first time
2009-02-04T03:25:00.000Z	oCean_	Baatti	no bookmarks, no settings, no plugins or whatsoever
2009-02-04T03:25:00.000Z	Baatti	oCean_	ok, I'll try starting there, thank you
2009-02-04T03:25:00.000Z	oCean_	Baatti	I'm not saying that's *the* solution, because your flashcam install might have done 'something' to the firefox installation, I really don't know. Renaming your .mozilla is a way to start
2009-02-04T03:26:00.000Z	Baatti	oCean_	yeah, it'll surely relieve some of the stress of having no access to the web
2009-02-04T03:28:00.000Z	Baatti	oCean_	Ok, I've moved the .mozilla directory, and can now start fresh, but any thoughts on how I can restore my previous mozilla status?
2009-02-04T03:30:00.000Z	oCean_	Baatti	well, not completely sure, but you might want to check the directories in your .mozilla_olddir (or whatever you named it) and move them one by one into the newly created .mozilla directory. Fire up the firefox and see if when it breaks.
2009-02-04T03:31:00.000Z	Baatti	oCean_	alright, I'll try that out. Thank you very much
2009-02-04T03:32:00.000Z	oCean_	Baatti	sure, no prob. You may want to be careful with your 'extensions' directory. I know I'd like my bookmarks back, for the rest of it... no worries :)
