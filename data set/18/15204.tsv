2007-08-17T07:53:00.000Z	nickrud	JESTER	the radeon driver that comes with ubuntu supports the 9250
2007-08-17T07:54:00.000Z	nickrud	JESTER	are you trying to run the XGL server?
2007-08-17T07:55:00.000Z	nickrud	JESTER	put your /etc/X11/xorg.conf on a pastebin if you can
2007-08-17T07:57:00.000Z	nickrud	JESTER	gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf ; cut and paste to a pastebin; if you only have terminal install pastebinit
2007-08-17T07:58:00.000Z	nickrud	JESTER	don't quote me, but for some people
2007-08-17T08:00:00.000Z	nickrud	JESTER	probably nothing, only a config problem
2007-08-17T08:00:00.000Z	nickrud	JESTER	there's always ssh. But, don't, anyway ;)
2007-08-17T08:16:00.000Z	nickrud	JESTER	you backed into a good situation
