2006-07-29T10:05:00.000Z	Ademan		its going to become part of XFree86
2006-07-29T10:05:00.000Z	Ademan		wheras Xgl is kinda novell saying "we can do it better"
2006-07-29T10:05:00.000Z	eyequeue	Ademan	ubuntu has not plans to go to XDeww86 however, right?
2006-07-29T10:05:00.000Z	eyequeue	Ademan	XFree86
2006-07-29T10:06:00.000Z	eyequeue	Ademan	xserver-xorg for the foreseeable future
2006-07-29T10:06:00.000Z	Ademan	eyequeue	regardless... the fact that its being adopted by a project says something
2006-07-29T10:07:00.000Z	eyequeue	Ademan	recent history in the FOSS community, over the past few years, almost all distros have dropped it like a rock
2006-07-29T10:08:00.000Z	Ademan	eyequeue	oh... my bad, but either way, AIGLX is being developed openly, instead of this XGL behind closed doors crap
2006-07-29T10:09:00.000Z	eyequeue	Ademan	xgl is closed source, non-free?  i had not known
2006-07-29T10:09:00.000Z	Ademan	eyequeue	its not nonfree, but a big portion of its development was done behind closed doors
2006-08-15T08:28:00.000Z	eyequeue	Ademan	no prob
2006-08-25T14:54:00.000Z	eyequeue	Ademan	ifconfig
2006-08-25T14:54:00.000Z	Ademan	eyequeue	ok i'll check it out thanks
2006-08-25T14:55:00.000Z	eyequeue	Ademan	"UP" there means what it says, its lack means it is down
2006-08-25T14:56:00.000Z	Ademan	eyequeue	beautiful, now is there a command that could enable a selected network interface? (really i just want to automate switching between wired and wireless ethernet)
2006-08-25T14:57:00.000Z	eyequeue	Ademan	sudo ifup wlan0 ; sudo ifdown eth0
2006-08-25T14:59:00.000Z	Ademan	eyequeue	is there a way to make that run every time a network interface goes down? or is the best way to do it add it to crontab at a reasonable interval?
2006-08-25T15:00:00.000Z	eyequeue	Ademan	i guess crontab
