2009-11-30T18:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wildman	http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/dapper/man8/ncpmount.8.html
2009-11-30T18:43:00.000Z	wildman	ActionParsnip	thx, but that's exactly what I don't need, I cannot start the Netware fileserver, I just have its disk
2009-11-30T18:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wildman	you will need to know the servers name to connect to it
2009-11-30T18:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wildman	or is the disk in a system yuo are booting ubuntu on and want access to the data?
2009-11-30T18:45:00.000Z	wildman	ActionParsnip	I don't have the server, just its disk. Even if I put the server's NIC and disk on a different computer, I cannot start it, the NIC driver is not being loaded, so I cannot access the fileserver from the outside
2009-11-30T18:45:00.000Z	wildman	ActionParsnip	I want to connect the server's disk on this Ubuntu desktop and access the Netware partition data, directly, like if it was any other partition type (for example NTFS)
2009-11-30T18:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wildman	with the system booted if you run: sudo fdisk -l   you should see the partition and disk if it is detected
2009-11-30T18:52:00.000Z	wildman	ActionParsnip	5' plz I'll reboot the machine having the disk with Ubuntu's live CD
2009-11-30T19:17:00.000Z	wildman	ActionParsnip	I may have found a possible workaround, if this possible workaround doesn't work, I'll come back to you for help, thx!
