2010-06-25T12:41:00.000Z	pehden		help has any one ever got a working IRC chat server runing on ubuntu server
2010-06-25T12:41:00.000Z	iceroot	pehden	sure soneone in this channel has. what is the real question/problem
2010-06-25T12:52:00.000Z	pehden	iceroot	every time i try to connect to my irc server it refuses the connection
2010-06-25T12:53:00.000Z	iceroot	pehden	look at the server log, run namp from the client to see if the port is open
2010-06-25T13:00:00.000Z	iceroot	pehden	127.0.0.1 is lo-interface not eth-interface, so its not using the network
2010-06-25T13:01:00.000Z	pehden	iceroot	ok should i change it to the hostname or domain name
2010-06-25T13:01:00.000Z	iceroot	pehden	hostname which is in /etc/hosts
2010-06-25T13:02:00.000Z	iceroot	pehden	that is resolving the hostname to the ip so the server is running on eth0
2010-06-25T13:02:00.000Z	pehden	iceroot	so i would use the hostname which is also my servers domain
2010-06-25T13:03:00.000Z	iceroot	pehden	correct, if ysou have a static ip you can also use the ip
2010-06-25T13:03:00.000Z	pehden	iceroot	ok kool
2010-06-25T13:12:00.000Z	pehden	iceroot	no it wont load i useing the hosname   aka domain.net     and now its failing to start
2010-06-25T13:13:00.000Z	iceroot	pehden	ok use the ip
2010-06-25T13:13:00.000Z	pehden	iceroot	the lan ip?
2010-06-25T13:18:00.000Z	iceroot	pehden	yes, the ip from eth0
