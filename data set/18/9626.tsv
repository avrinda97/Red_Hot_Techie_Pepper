2008-02-26T01:50:00.000Z	rysiek|pl		I've been with this on #kubuntu (I am a KDE user) but they couldn't/wouldn't help, and as it's pretty low-level (acpid) problem, figured maybe I get some help here
2008-02-26T01:52:00.000Z	bullgard4	rysiek|pl	And what is your problem?
2008-02-26T01:52:00.000Z	rysiek|pl	bullgard4	writing it down, a sec ;)
2008-02-26T01:53:00.000Z	rysiek|pl	bullgard4	^^^
2008-02-26T01:58:00.000Z	bullgard4	rysiek|pl	I find it normal that the display gets blanked when you close the lid. And reappears when you reopen it. So what is your problem?
2008-02-26T01:59:00.000Z	rysiek|pl	bullgard4	the problem is that acpid does *not* get the lid events
2008-02-26T02:00:00.000Z	rysiek|pl	bullgard4	and it is so strange BECAUSE the screen gets blanked, as if acpid received the events
2008-02-26T02:01:00.000Z	rysiek|pl	bullgard4	and, the lidbtn works AOK, as the proper state sits in /proc/acpi/button/lid/*/state
2008-02-26T02:05:00.000Z	bullgard4	rysiek|pl	Ah. Now I understand your problem a bit better. -- The apparent discrepancy may be caused by the synchronous appearance of the button event and its consequence: a dark screen. I would try to resolve it by consulting your event log. Closing the lid button should reflect in the the event log.
2008-02-26T02:05:00.000Z	rysiek|pl	bullgard4	as I said, it isn't reflected
2008-02-26T02:05:00.000Z	rysiek|pl	bullgard4	and that's what's strange
2008-02-26T02:06:00.000Z	bullgard4	rysiek|pl	What event log did you scrutinize?
2008-02-26T02:06:00.000Z	rysiek|pl	bullgard4	dmesg, syslog, /var/log/acpid
2008-02-26T02:06:00.000Z	rysiek|pl	bullgard4	I get all the powerbtn and CPU events in the latter
2008-02-26T02:07:00.000Z	rysiek|pl	bullgard4	but no lidbtn events
2008-02-26T02:08:00.000Z	bullgard4	rysiek|pl	I have no explanation for your findings. May be you'd discuss the matter with another person. If he has no explanation either then file a bug report.
2008-02-26T02:09:00.000Z	rysiek|pl	bullgard4	ok, thanks for your time
