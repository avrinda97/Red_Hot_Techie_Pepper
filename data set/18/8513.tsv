2008-03-06T17:07:00.000Z	usr13		Getting error:  "Ubuntu is running in Low-Graphics mode"  I installed Nvidia drivers from Nvidia and it appears that the package manager did away with it.  How is the best/easiest way to fix this?
2008-03-06T17:09:00.000Z	usr13		I guess Ubuntu repos have nvidia-glx and nvidia-kernel-source packages and we need to stick with that instead of downloading Nvidia drivers from nvidia.com.  Right?  I screwed up; Right?
2008-03-06T17:10:00.000Z	usr13		Go ahead and tell me I screwed up. I'm a big boy, I can take it!  :)
2008-03-06T17:12:00.000Z	usr13		Guess I need to go to:  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
2008-03-06T17:14:00.000Z	usr13		Well, anything but a broken heart.
2008-03-06T17:14:00.000Z	TelnetManta	usr13	You more than likely just need to adjust your zorg.conf file to load the nvidia driver again.
2008-03-06T17:15:00.000Z	usr13	TelnetManta	That's what I wanted to hear.
2008-03-06T17:15:00.000Z	TelnetManta		package manager wouldnt have "uninstalled" the nvidia driver but it could have disabled it in favor of the nvidia-glx driver.
2008-03-06T17:15:00.000Z	TelnetManta		*glx
2008-03-06T17:15:00.000Z	usr13	TelnetManta	And I like the way you spell it.  :)
2008-03-06T17:16:00.000Z	TelnetManta	usr13	LOL *xorg.conf
2008-03-06T17:16:00.000Z	TelnetManta		missed that
2008-03-06T17:16:00.000Z	TelnetManta	usr13	Just make sure that your using the nvidia driver under the device section.
2008-03-06T17:16:00.000Z	usr13	TelnetManta	But if it changes it once, who's to say it won't change it again?
2008-03-06T17:17:00.000Z	TelnetManta		don't sweat it. It's not difficult to change. In fact I use the nvidia driver (via Envy) and havent had it overwritten, ever.......
2008-03-06T17:17:00.000Z	TelnetManta	usr13	^
2008-03-06T17:17:00.000Z	usr13	TelnetManta	dennda;  I set this box up for a friend so he could play tremulous and it puked on him the first time he rebooted, so... I dono.
2008-03-06T17:19:00.000Z	usr13	TelnetManta	danand;  I just installed Ubuntu and then downloaded and installed Nvidia driver and then installed tremulous (from the package manager), and was working fine when I left.  Now he emails me with this error and I assume it's blown away the nvidia driver.
