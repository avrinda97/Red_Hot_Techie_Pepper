2010-08-01T23:15:00.000Z	danielig		hey, how can I get rid of nepomuk?
2010-08-01T23:16:00.000Z	c3l	danielig	uninstall it?
2010-08-01T23:16:00.000Z	danielig	c3l	no
2010-08-01T23:17:00.000Z	c3l	danielig	what was the problem?
2010-08-01T23:18:00.000Z	c3l	danielig	all it does is running updatedb afaik, and thats cool
2010-08-01T23:18:00.000Z	c3l	danielig	lets you use $ locate foo
2010-08-01T23:20:00.000Z	c3l	danielig	hmm try: sudo apt-get remove virtuoso-nepomuk
2010-08-01T23:22:00.000Z	c3l	danielig	this package virtuosoconverter?
2010-08-01T23:22:00.000Z	c3l	danielig	libnepomuk2.2-cil too
2010-08-01T23:23:00.000Z	c3l	danielig	then its probably kde trying to start some nonexisting processes, you need to change that configuration I guess
2010-08-01T23:24:00.000Z	c3l	danielig	if you want someting more lightweight and not all stuff included in kde or gnome I suggest using some other DE or just a set of tools you choose on your own
2010-08-01T23:30:00.000Z	c3l	danielig	:D
2010-08-01T23:46:00.000Z	c3l	danielig	check systemsettings, I think there is some search/database blääh thingy you can configure there
2010-08-01T23:47:00.000Z	danielig	c3l	I have removed all desktop search
2010-08-01T23:47:00.000Z	c3l	danielig	woot, your problem is really strange
2010-08-01T23:49:00.000Z	c3l	danielig	and youve restarted after removing it?
2010-08-01T23:49:00.000Z	c3l	danielig	find the kde startupscript and remove that process from starting ;)
2010-08-01T23:50:00.000Z	danielig	c3l	done that already
