2008-12-30T15:52:00.000Z	|HSOt|SadiQ		rebooting changes that Ip...but the same thing appears in firestarter...just a different port :(
2008-12-30T15:52:00.000Z	|HSOt|SadiQ		:(
2008-12-30T15:52:00.000Z	|HSOt|SadiQ		I hate rebooting
2008-12-30T15:53:00.000Z	|HSOt|SadiQ		nope
2008-12-30T15:53:00.000Z	|HSOt|SadiQ		nope
2008-12-30T15:53:00.000Z	|HSOt|SadiQ		:P
2008-12-30T15:53:00.000Z	|HSOt|SadiQ		no router...cable goes in eth0
2008-12-30T15:54:00.000Z	|HSOt|SadiQ		it's not the same???
2008-12-30T15:54:00.000Z	|HSOt|SadiQ		I'm not exactly newbie i linux :P
2008-12-30T15:54:00.000Z	|HSOt|SadiQ		yes
2008-12-30T15:54:00.000Z	PokerFacePenguin	|HSOt|SadiQ	you can sudo dhclient eth0
2008-12-30T16:03:00.000Z	PokerFacePenguin	|HSOt|SadiQ	that command sends out a dhcp request
2008-12-30T16:04:00.000Z	PokerFacePenguin	|HSOt|SadiQ	hmmm, no dhcp server listening to give you an ip
2008-12-30T16:05:00.000Z	PokerFacePenguin	|HSOt|SadiQ	but you did it on ppp0 not eth0
2008-12-30T16:07:00.000Z	PokerFacePenguin	|HSOt|SadiQ	you could deny that domain in iptables i believe....
2008-12-30T16:09:00.000Z	PokerFacePenguin	|HSOt|SadiQ	your best/easiest solution is a router
2008-12-30T16:10:00.000Z	PokerFacePenguin	|HSOt|SadiQ	technically you could set it up with virtual ethernet interface and some routing, but that is a big onion to peel
2008-12-30T16:12:00.000Z	PokerFacePenguin	|HSOt|SadiQ	yeah, its gonna work fine till somebody finds you
