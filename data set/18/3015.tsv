2010-01-04T21:20:00.000Z	soreau	madura	What model card?
2010-01-04T21:20:00.000Z	madura	soreau	HD 2600 Pro
2010-01-04T21:21:00.000Z	soreau	madura	If you are using karmic and the open source drivers via the xorg-edgers repo, booting with radeon.modeset=1 will enable kms and fix the issue
2010-01-04T21:22:00.000Z	soreau	madura	You dont have to turn off compiz if you use the open source radeon driver and kms
2010-01-04T21:22:00.000Z	madura	soreau	i have intrepid ATM is open source drivers stable enough? where can i get them?
2010-01-04T21:23:00.000Z	madura	soreau	what;s KMS?
2010-01-04T21:24:00.000Z	soreau	madura	joaopinto: You can get the open source drivers for newer model ati cards with 3D support from the xorg-edgers repo. In order for them to work, fglrx must be completely removed from the system
2010-01-04T21:24:00.000Z	soreau	madura	KMS = Kernel Modesetting
2010-01-04T21:25:00.000Z	madura	soreau	i read the ubuntu docs on open drivers they say that RV6xx don't get full 3D acceleration
2010-01-04T21:26:00.000Z	soreau	madura	It gets acceleration to run compiz and they are working on glsl support. The open drivers are indeed in an experimental phase but they still provide 3D
2010-01-04T21:28:00.000Z	madura	soreau	i'll give it a try
2010-01-04T21:28:00.000Z	madura	soreau	on wine?
2010-01-04T21:29:00.000Z	soreau	madura	wine is heavily geared toward nvidia users
2010-01-04T21:29:00.000Z	madura	soreau	well then i'll dual boot windows :D much easier!
2010-01-04T21:31:00.000Z	soreau	madura	Threads for what?
2010-01-04T21:32:00.000Z	madura	soreau	about this whole filcker thing!
2010-01-04T21:33:00.000Z	soreau	madura	I already told you how to fix it and the only way while using fglrx is to turn off compiz
