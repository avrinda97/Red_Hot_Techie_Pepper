2011-01-19T03:49:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT		does anyone know when 2.6.37 will be available as a standard update for maverick?
2011-01-19T03:50:00.000Z	sam-_-	FiReSTaRT	it should be no problem to install this even though it says natty: http://kernel.ubuntu.com/~kernel-ppa/mainline/v2.6.37-natty/
2011-01-19T03:52:00.000Z	sam-_-	FiReSTaRT	it will NOT replace your kernel. it will be installed alongside your "old" kernel
2011-01-19T03:52:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	sam-_-	so i'd go into grub and boot under it?
2011-01-19T03:53:00.000Z	sam-_-	FiReSTaRT	y. basically that's it.
2011-01-19T03:53:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	sam-_-	so i just install the 2 packages, run update grub and reboot?
2011-01-19T03:54:00.000Z	sam-_-	FiReSTaRT	it should run update-grub automatically after installing. doesn't hurt to do it manually though.
2011-01-19T03:54:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	sam-_-	we'll see... but i'll blow my load if i dont have to depend on sta :P
2011-01-19T03:55:00.000Z	sam-_-	FiReSTaRT	how is the module called?
2011-01-19T03:56:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	sam-_-	not sure about modules, but 2.6.37 should have native support for broadcom wireless chipsets... that means that i don't have to use the proprietary driver
2011-01-19T03:57:00.000Z	sam-_-	FiReSTaRT	i wouldn't count on it but it's worth a try.
2011-01-19T03:58:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	sam-_-	do i install just the headers and image for amd64 architecture or also that headers all package?
2011-01-19T04:00:00.000Z	sam-_-	FiReSTaRT	if you don't use dkms (thirdparty modules) you don't have to install the headers at all. i recommend installing all 3 packages though.
2011-01-19T04:00:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	sam-_-	btw i'm going by this link http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/205258/linux_wifi_gets_easier_with_new_broadcom_driver.html
2011-01-19T04:00:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	sam-_-	ok and which order should i install'em in?
2011-01-19T04:01:00.000Z	sam-_-	FiReSTaRT	in the order it works :-)   kernel   headers-all  headers-generic
2011-01-19T04:02:00.000Z	FiReSTaRT	sam-_-	ok.. sounds like a plan.. thanks buddy.. i never did this outside of the normal update process :)
2011-01-19T04:02:00.000Z	sam-_-	FiReSTaRT	good luck.
