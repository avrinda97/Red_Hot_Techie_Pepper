2008-10-31T05:26:00.000Z	codemaster		so i am having a lovely problem with intrepid... it seems that i am having nvidia driver issues... i have reinstalled nvidia drivers version 177, but they still don't work.
2008-10-31T05:27:00.000Z	storrgie	codemaster	what card?
2008-10-31T05:27:00.000Z	codemaster	storrgie	geforce 8600 mobile
2008-10-31T05:27:00.000Z	storrgie	codemaster	should not have an issue with 177
2008-10-31T05:28:00.000Z	codemaster	storrgie	right; I did a reisntall of the 177 drivers and reconfigured my xserver-xorg, but it says it can't load "type1" or the nvidia module
2008-10-31T05:28:00.000Z	storrgie	codemaster	dont know man, i have a GTX260 and i cannot get it to run with 177 or the binary drivers
2008-10-31T05:30:00.000Z	codemaster	storrgie	i am thinking maybe reconfigure xserver-xorg and then viewing my x configuration and making sure it looks okay, i guess?
2008-10-31T05:30:00.000Z	storrgie	codemaster	im doing the same thing right now
2008-10-31T05:31:00.000Z	codemaster	storrgie	having issues or? :P
2008-10-31T05:32:00.000Z	storrgie	codemaster	i dont know how to do a reconfigure... its asking me questions about my keyboard i have no idea
2008-10-31T05:32:00.000Z	codemaster	storrgie	haha, yeah, that's what xserver-xorg does
2008-10-31T05:32:00.000Z	storrgie	codemaster	any suggestions?
2008-10-31T05:32:00.000Z	codemaster	storrgie	nope :(
2008-10-31T05:32:00.000Z	storrgie	codemaster	i just want to remove the bin drivers....
2008-10-31T05:33:00.000Z	codemaster	storrgie	ah
2008-10-31T05:33:00.000Z	storrgie		how do i remove the nvidia bin drivers?
2008-10-31T05:33:00.000Z	codemaster		i guess i'll try a bit of fussing and see what happens...
2008-10-31T05:33:00.000Z	codemaster	storrgie	sudo aptitude purge maybe
