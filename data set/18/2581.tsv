2010-05-11T09:01:00.000Z	BPower		On Lucid, is Grub bootup page supposed to be just a black screen with a list of options?
2010-05-11T09:01:00.000Z	BPower		...or is it supposed to be themed?
2010-05-11T09:01:00.000Z	h00k	BPower	it depends on if you're dualbooting or not
2010-05-11T09:02:00.000Z	h00k	BPower	by default, there's no theme
2010-05-11T09:02:00.000Z	BPower	h00k	how do I enable the theme?
2010-05-11T09:03:00.000Z	h00k	BPower	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Grub2#Theming
2010-05-11T09:06:00.000Z	BPower	h00k	it doesn't say how to enable it...
2010-05-11T09:10:00.000Z	h00k	BPower	you can remove those extra kernels from synaptic
2010-05-11T09:10:00.000Z	BPower	h00k	i looked but I didn't see any extra kernals.
2010-05-11T09:10:00.000Z	h00k	BPower	if you don't, then do sudo update-grub
2010-05-11T09:12:00.000Z	BPower	h00k	here's the output: http://pastebin.org/220101  I think they're all still there
2010-05-11T09:13:00.000Z	h00k	BPower	those should be in Synaptic, then
2010-05-11T09:13:00.000Z	h00k	BPower	sudo apt-get remove linux-image-versionnumberhere
2010-05-11T09:15:00.000Z	BPower	h00k	bastid_raZor, so based on that paste i just posted, I should sudo apt-get remove linux-image-2.6.32-(13,17,18,19,20, and 21)
2010-05-11T09:16:00.000Z	h00k	BPower	yep, you can use tab-complete to help you as well
2010-05-11T09:16:00.000Z	BPower	h00k	thanks, i'll try that out
2010-05-11T09:21:00.000Z	BPower	h00k	Thanks, I think that did the trick :)
2010-05-11T09:21:00.000Z	h00k	BPower	cool, then update your grub, and all is good
