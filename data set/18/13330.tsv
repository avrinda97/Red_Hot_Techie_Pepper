2005-12-22T10:50:00.000Z	thegladiator		does nyone use  a dvx player here ?
2005-12-22T10:51:00.000Z	thegladiator		is *.divx a real format ?
2005-12-22T10:51:00.000Z	thegladiator		or is *.avi the real format for divx ?
2005-12-22T10:52:00.000Z	thegladiator		any one knows ?
2005-12-22T10:52:00.000Z	oskude	thegladiator	yes, i think "divx" is also a "standardized" container format like avi...
2005-12-22T10:53:00.000Z	oskude	thegladiator	just rename it to *avi and try...
2005-12-22T10:54:00.000Z	oskude	thegladiator	you also have to look what version of divx the movie is, and what your hardware divxplayer can
2006-01-08T10:37:00.000Z	oskude	thegladiator	try "xubuntu-desktop"
2006-01-08T10:39:00.000Z	oskude	thegladiator	did you do "sudo apt-get update" after adding universe and co ?
2006-01-08T10:39:00.000Z	thegladiator	oskude	yes...been using ub for a while
2006-01-08T10:39:00.000Z	oskude	thegladiator	"apt-get -s ..." = simulation
2006-01-08T10:41:00.000Z	oskude	thegladiator	you can use "-s" with apt-get to simulate anything it can (remove, install, etc...)
2006-01-08T10:42:00.000Z	oskude	thegladiator	yes, you need to close synaptic for apt-get install
2006-01-08T10:43:00.000Z	oskude	thegladiator	i think it will ask you if you really want to install (and shows the download size)
2006-04-01T13:27:00.000Z	oskude	thegladiator	mockup ~= fake
2006-04-01T13:27:00.000Z	thegladiator	oskude	that means it can be made to look that way ?
2006-04-01T13:27:00.000Z	oskude	thegladiator	mockup means, he did that "screenshot" with an image editor...
