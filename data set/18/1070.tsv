2011-06-12T03:47:00.000Z	talbert		what's the command to enable/disable the wireless card?
2011-06-12T03:49:00.000Z	talbert		is it simply 'ifconfig wlan0 down'
2011-06-12T03:50:00.000Z	escott	talbert	that takes down the network interface
2011-06-12T03:50:00.000Z	escott	talbert	if your intent is to reduce power consumption you might try removing the kernel module
2011-06-12T03:55:00.000Z	talbert	escott	what about 'iwconfig' instead? i'm asking because i'm not sure if i'll mess something up doing this.
2011-06-12T03:57:00.000Z	escott	talbert	i dont see anything in iwconfig to turn off the card, why do you want to do this again?
2011-06-12T04:00:00.000Z	escott	talbert	in that case I would just use network manager and click on disable network if you dont have a gui try nm-tool
2011-06-12T04:01:00.000Z	talbert	escott	'nm-tool'? not familiar with that one. i'll look it up.
2011-06-12T04:02:00.000Z	escott	talbert	but really ifconfig down should be enough to make sure no traffic is sent across that. its just that networkmanager may not play nice and bring the interface back up
2011-06-12T06:04:00.000Z	escott	talbert	i dont think it draws that dpad but it should function the same way
2011-06-12T06:06:00.000Z	talbert	escott	it doesn't for me. you know what i'm referring to, right? it accelerates the page in the direction that you move the mouse. also, what do you call this function?
2011-06-12T06:11:00.000Z	talbert	escott	it doesn't for me. you know what i'm referring to, right? it accelerates the page in the direction that you move the mouse. also, what do you call this function?
2011-06-12T06:12:00.000Z	escott	talbert	yeah i've had it before too. is it in about:config
2011-06-12T06:13:00.000Z	talbert	escott	do you know which variable it is. i've looked and haven't had any success.
2011-06-12T06:14:00.000Z	talbert	escott	also, i thought it was mouse driver related because it's a cross browser problem.
2011-06-12T06:15:00.000Z	escott	talbert	i dont think so. the browser can react to buttons however it would like
2011-06-12T06:18:00.000Z	talbert	escott	you mean it's coincidence that neither firefox nor chrome have it on ubuntu?
2011-06-12T06:19:00.000Z	escott	talbert	which button is it in windows
