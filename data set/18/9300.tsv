2007-04-20T14:43:00.000Z	Shauny	eck	do you know what it means by: pam_start() failed, error 26
2007-04-20T14:44:00.000Z	eck	Shauny	what gave you that error message?
2007-04-20T14:44:00.000Z	Shauny	eck	im following a tutorial, url http://www.spencerstirling.com/computergeek/mysqluser.html, and im using the passwd function
2007-04-20T14:46:00.000Z	eck	Shauny	i am guessing that the mysql module couldn't be loaded, look at /var/log/auth.log
2007-04-20T14:47:00.000Z	Shauny	eck	what is the module?
2007-04-20T14:47:00.000Z	eck	Shauny	the mysql module
2007-04-20T14:47:00.000Z	eck	Shauny	libpam-mysql
2007-04-20T14:48:00.000Z	eck	Shauny	fyi, it is much more common to do auth using an ldap directory than it is to use a mysql database, there is probably a lot more information on how to do that
2007-04-20T14:53:00.000Z	eck	Shauny	i think the parse error means you messed up the format of /etc/pam.d/common-account
2007-04-20T14:55:00.000Z	Shauny	eck	do the spaces between account and sufficient have to be tab spaces?
2007-04-20T14:56:00.000Z	eck	Shauny	afaik spaces vs. tabs does not matter
2007-04-20T14:58:00.000Z	Shauny	eck	wha does it mean by failed to initialise headers?
2007-04-20T14:58:00.000Z	eck	Shauny	i am not sure
2007-04-20T14:59:00.000Z	Shauny	eck	sorry i meant handlers
2007-04-20T15:11:00.000Z	Shauny	eck	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/16654/ my common-account file
2007-04-20T15:17:00.000Z	eck	Shauny	i am not sure what the problem is. I have used pam + mysql, but it was for postfix + courier, not logins
2007-04-20T15:18:00.000Z	eck	Shauny	unless you're really attached to the idea of doing SQL lookups, directory services like AD and LDAP are much more common for user information, and i think there are docs for it on the ubuntu wiki
2007-04-20T15:19:00.000Z	eck	Shauny	if you already use a SQL database for users and want to tie GDM into that then it would be ok, but if you are starting from scratch a directory service is probably better down the road
