2006-07-03T15:06:00.000Z	Tom06		i have a little problem , i use kaffeine in Ubuntu(gnome) for watching DVB i get video but not audio Please Help.
2006-07-03T15:07:00.000Z	Tom06		well?
2006-07-03T15:08:00.000Z	EdLin	Tom06	maybe kaffeine, a KDE application, is trying to use aRTs. If possible, reconfigure it to use esd or alsa or OSS.
2006-07-03T15:08:00.000Z	Tom06		sound works otherwise
2006-07-03T15:08:00.000Z	Tom06		just not in kaffeine
2006-07-03T15:09:00.000Z	Tom06		i tried setting it to use esd alsa or OSS to no avail...
2006-07-03T15:10:00.000Z	Tom06		any sugestions possibly any codecs to install?
2006-07-03T15:11:00.000Z	Tom06		mplayer wont work for me I need Kaffeine for DVB-T
2006-07-03T15:12:00.000Z	Tom06		is there anyone that can give me some proper help?
2006-07-03T15:14:00.000Z	Tom06	EdLin	Sound works otherwise
2006-07-03T15:15:00.000Z	EdLin	Tom06	that's precisely why I think its a sound daemon issue
2006-07-03T15:15:00.000Z	Tom06	EdLin	Please elaborate , sound works in XMMS and Totem(gstreamer)
2006-07-03T15:16:00.000Z	EdLin	Tom06	I've already told you it, scroll back and read what I said.
2006-07-03T15:16:00.000Z	Tom06	EdLin	And what should I do???
2006-07-03T15:17:00.000Z	EdLin	Tom06	I've never used Kaffeine, so all I can tell you is to search for the options for it not to use the aRTS KDE daemon.
2006-07-03T15:18:00.000Z	Tom06	EdLin	Thanks , but that still doest solve my problem , I've tried everything up to 3oclock this morning and still no go , I've even istalled arts
2006-07-03T15:19:00.000Z	EdLin	Tom06	I've never used Kaffeine, so the best I can do is give my best guess.
2006-07-03T15:19:00.000Z	Tom06	EdLin	Thanks Anyway
