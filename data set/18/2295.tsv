2010-06-23T03:32:00.000Z	puff		Yes.
2010-06-23T03:33:00.000Z	puff		Yeah, just recently.
2010-06-23T03:33:00.000Z	puff		But I can't upgrade yet because I'm out of disk space.  I either need to back up and install from scratch, or backup and resize my partitions, then upgrade.

2010-06-23T03:34:00.000Z	Seaphor	puff	thats why its always a good idea to have your /home on a separate partition
2010-06-23T03:34:00.000Z	puff	Seaphor	It is, actually.
2010-06-23T03:34:00.000Z	puff	Seaphor	But it's the root partition that's too small.
2010-06-23T03:34:00.000Z	puff	Seaphor	Everybody told me "5 GB should be *more* than enough..."
2010-06-23T03:35:00.000Z	Seaphor	puff	what size is your / part?
2010-06-23T03:36:00.000Z	puff	Seaphor	root is 5GB, home is 10GB, bulk partition is 30GB, swap is 4GB.
2010-06-23T03:37:00.000Z	Seaphor	puff	no need for swaap tobe that big, you'll never use that much unless you have massive vms or something
2010-06-23T03:40:00.000Z	Seaphor	puff	i use a 2gb swap and have no issue with S3/S4 (sleep/hibernation)
2010-06-23T03:41:00.000Z	puff	Seaphor	I have 2GB of memory, so I made it 4GB of swap.
2010-06-23T03:41:00.000Z	puff	Seaphor	But, you've sold me on it, now how hard/tricky is it?
2010-06-23T03:42:00.000Z	Seaphor	puff	use gparted off of a live cd,,, not hard
2010-06-23T03:42:00.000Z	puff	Seaphor	Hm, hokay, I'll try that tongiht (after I take a backup, just to be sure...).
2010-06-23T03:43:00.000Z	Seaphor	puff	if you need me i'll be in ##c4
2010-06-23T03:44:00.000Z	puff	Seaphor	Cool, thanks.
