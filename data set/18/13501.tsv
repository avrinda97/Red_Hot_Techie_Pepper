2005-11-15T13:03:00.000Z	Ceddy23		lemme try that right now
2005-11-15T13:03:00.000Z	dirkson	Ceddy23	Type it into the terminal
2005-11-15T13:03:00.000Z	dirkson	Ceddy23	Then it'll barf back all the stuff attached to the PCI
2005-11-15T13:04:00.000Z	dirkson	Ceddy23	Including what chipset your modem it! ^.^
2005-11-15T13:04:00.000Z	dirkson	Ceddy23	*is, not it
2005-11-15T13:05:00.000Z	dirkson	Ceddy23	Well, everyone online will be using its -exact- linux chipset, so finding that and copy/pasting into google becomes very, very useful
2005-11-15T13:05:00.000Z	dirkson	Ceddy23	I had to do basically the same with with a weird TI carbus controller my laptop has. Wow did that turn into a headache
2005-11-15T13:06:00.000Z	dirkson	Ceddy23	It's hard : ) I'm unemployed, so I have some spare time.... I was a total n00b two days ago : )
2005-11-15T13:08:00.000Z	dirkson	Ceddy23	Installing apps still greatly confuses me, but at least I know something about the file systems, and how to use the command line
