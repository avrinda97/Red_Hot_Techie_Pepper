2011-04-10T16:42:00.000Z	kwtm	thedude1	Hey, it looks like it's working!  I missed part of the conversation.  Is everything ok now?
2011-04-10T16:43:00.000Z	thedude1	kwtm	but nm-applet doesnt show me my 3g connection i created before ...
2011-04-10T16:44:00.000Z	kwtm	thedude1	Hmm... I might not be able to help you much from here on.  I use Kubuntu and don't use nm-applet (I tend to do things from the command-line).  Tell whoever was/will be helping you that network-manager is now running.  Now you know how to start or restart it.
2011-04-10T16:45:00.000Z	thedude1	kwtm	can you tell me how I can connect with 3g using commandline? :)
2011-04-10T16:47:00.000Z	kwtm	thedude1	Will try.  Do you have info on your 3g channel?  I don't know that much about "3g" --is that by cellular modem, then?
2011-04-10T16:48:00.000Z	thedude1	kwtm	yes, it is cellular. what exactly do you mean by "3g channel"? my ISP?
2011-04-10T16:48:00.000Z	kwtm	thedude1	Sorry, I meant "3g connection", as in "my 3g connection i created before"
2011-04-10T16:49:00.000Z	kwtm	thedude1	I may have to go soon, so we'll work quickly so you have more info in case I have to bug out suddenly.  What does "ifconfig" give?  What interfaces?
2011-04-10T16:49:00.000Z	kwtm	thedude1	I'm guessing   eth0   and   wlan0   and   lo.  What else?  Are you running Ubuntu on a cell phone, then?
2011-04-10T16:50:00.000Z	kwtm	thedude1	What about "ifconfig -a"?
2011-04-10T16:51:00.000Z	thedude1	kwtm	exact same
2011-04-10T16:51:00.000Z	kwtm	thedude1	I'm guessing 10.10?  (I don't think 11.04 is out yet.)
2011-04-10T16:52:00.000Z	kwtm	thedude1	I guess my noobly knowledge stops here.  If even "sudo ifconfig -a" doesn't show a wwan0 connection, then we're going to have to go to lsmod'ing and seeing why your internal 3g modem isn't up.
2011-04-10T16:52:00.000Z	kwtm	thedude1	Right, 3g modem might be specialized enough that you need to ask the forums, which means more detailed help but it won't be an instant-response type of thing.
2011-04-10T16:53:00.000Z	kwtm	thedude1	Other than googling, which I'm sure you know about, you may also want to try... hmm, I wonder if there's a "live CD" equivalent for netbooks (like, boot from USB)?
2011-04-10T16:53:00.000Z	thedude1	kwtm	okay then, I'll try and solve this via the forums. thanks! have a nice day
2011-04-10T16:54:00.000Z	kwtm	thedude1	best of luck!
