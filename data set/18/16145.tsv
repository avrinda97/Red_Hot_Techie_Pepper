2005-03-09T14:55:00.000Z	Yomic		The following is a list of important considerations regarding directories and partitions.
2005-03-09T14:55:00.000Z	Yomic		The root partition / must always physically contain /etc, /bin, /sbin, /lib and /dev, otherwise you won't be able to boot. Typically 100 MB is needed for the root partition, but this may vary.
2005-03-09T14:55:00.000Z	Yomic		/usr: all user programs (/usr/bin), libraries (/usr/lib), documentation (/usr/share/doc), etc., are in this directory. This part of the file system needs most of the space. You should provide at least 500 MB of disk space for a minimal installation, and at least 1.5 GB if you want to install a standard Ubuntu desktop. If you want to install more packages you should increase the amount of space you give this directory.
2005-03-09T14:55:00.000Z	Yomic		/home: every user will put his data into a subdirectory of this directory. The size of this depends on how many users will be using the system and what files are to be stored in their directories. Depending on your planned usage you should reserve about 100 MB for each user, but adapt this value to your needs.
2005-03-09T14:55:00.000Z	Yomic		/var: all variable data like news articles, e-mails, web sites, the packaging system cache, etc. will be placed under this directory. The size of this directory depends greatly on the usage of your computer, but for most people will be dictated by the package management tool's overhead. If you are going to do a full installation of just about everything Ubuntu has to offer, all in one session, setting aside 2 or 3 gigabytes of space for /var sho
2005-03-09T14:55:00.000Z	Yomic		/tmp: if a program creates temporary data it will most likely go in /tmp. 20-50 MB should usually be enough
