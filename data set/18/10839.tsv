2007-01-02T10:45:00.000Z	jewbilee		I was able to install amarok using synaptic and its looks great!
2007-01-02T10:46:00.000Z	levander	jewbilee	you are using kubuntu, or you decided to use amarok on top of GNOME?
2007-01-02T10:46:00.000Z	levander	jewbilee	you like amarok better than whatever the standard GNOME one is?
2007-01-02T10:47:00.000Z	levander	jewbilee	how come?
2007-01-02T10:47:00.000Z	jewbilee	levander	the first distro of linux i use was mandriva which used KDE and i just got used to amaroK, so I'm used to it
2007-01-02T10:47:00.000Z	levander	jewbilee	ah, i see
2007-01-02T10:48:00.000Z	levander	jewbilee	i'm fighting in my head between KDE and GNOME, so I was just curious.
2007-01-02T10:48:00.000Z	jewbilee	levander	i like gnome so far though, it's very clean
2007-01-02T10:48:00.000Z	levander	jewbilee	yeah, exactly
2007-01-02T10:49:00.000Z	levander	jewbilee	GNOME seems cleaner.  But, KDE has a better API and more applications.  The API being a particularly bitter point because of the whole Mono thing in GNOME.
2007-01-02T10:49:00.000Z	levander	jewbilee	That's my impression anyway.
2007-01-02T10:49:00.000Z	jewbilee	levander	What do you mean by better API?
2007-01-02T10:49:00.000Z	levander	jewbilee	As a long time KDE user, you would personally say GNOME is cleaner?
2007-01-02T10:49:00.000Z	jewbilee	levander	hahaha if by long time you mean about a week, yes
2007-01-02T10:50:00.000Z	jewbilee	levander	i abandoned linux once, then came to ubuntu, then left again, and am now back
2007-01-02T10:50:00.000Z	jewbilee	levander	what do you mean KDEs API is better?
2007-01-02T10:51:00.000Z	levander	jewbilee	KDE is written on the Qt library.  Which bases a lot of its ideas on what is now Apple's Cocoa.  It's very object oriented.
2007-01-02T10:52:00.000Z	levander	jewbilee	GNOME's GTK API has tons of little parameters for every method call, they don't use default values enough.
