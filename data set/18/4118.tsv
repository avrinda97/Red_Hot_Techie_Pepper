2009-07-21T15:42:00.000Z	gartral	rikki_max	any idea why one would loose the rotation ability in nvidia-config after a bios failure?
2009-07-21T15:43:00.000Z	rikki_max	gartral	bios interacts with the hardware so if that dies in theory u would lose everything
2009-07-21T15:44:00.000Z	gartral	rikki_max	it didnt die, as i reset it (jumper) and was able too recover the system without further incident... but i lost the ability too rotate output for portrait view, and now my gfx card runs too hot
2009-07-21T15:45:00.000Z	rikki_max	gartral	:o umm u may have broken something somewhere, umm update + upgrade and do apt-get check
2009-07-21T15:46:00.000Z	gartral	rikki_max	ive done that many many times since this happened
2009-07-21T15:46:00.000Z	rikki_max	gartral	reconfigure X11?
2009-07-21T15:47:00.000Z	gartral	rikki_max	how.. my xorg.conf is empty.. and has been since i upgraded too jaunty (which screen rotate worked after the Jump)
2009-07-21T15:47:00.000Z	rikki_max	gartral	if xorg.conf is empty u NEED to reconfigure
2009-07-21T15:48:00.000Z	gartral	rikki_max	but x is working fine..
2009-07-21T15:48:00.000Z	rikki_max	gartral	yes but u cannot rotate the screen which xorg does
2009-07-21T15:48:00.000Z	gartral	rikki_max	ok, how do i reconfigure nvidia-xorg?
2009-07-21T15:49:00.000Z	rikki_max	gartral	no u need to reconfigure X11
2009-07-21T15:49:00.000Z	gartral	rikki_max	alright, nvidia-X11 then
2009-07-21T15:50:00.000Z	rikki_max	gartral	do this sudo dpkg-reconfgure X11
2009-07-21T15:51:00.000Z	gartral	rikki_max	woaw, i already did that once and it reset my drivers setting too use the on board graphic; do not want!
