2007-07-29T15:10:00.000Z	Happu	fyrestrtr	I think I installed the newest one. Does it differ from compiling?
2007-07-29T15:10:00.000Z	Happu	fyrestrtr	I
2007-07-29T15:10:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Happu	yeah.
2007-07-29T15:01:00.000Z	Happu	fyrestrtr	are you using ICH8?
2007-07-29T15:03:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Happu	no, ICH7
2007-07-29T15:04:00.000Z	Happu	fyrestrtr	ok. thanks
2007-07-29T15:08:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Happu	what is the string from lscpi?
2007-07-29T15:09:00.000Z	Happu	fyrestrtr	00:1b.0 Audio device: Intel Corporation 82801H (ICH8 Family) HD Audio Controller (rev 03)
2007-07-29T15:09:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Happu	you should try compiling alsa from source.
2007-07-29T15:10:00.000Z	Happu	fyrestrtr	ok, thanks I'll try :)
2007-07-29T15:12:00.000Z	Happu	fyrestrtr	do you think that the source in repos is enough, or should it be the newest one?
2007-07-29T15:12:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Happu	no, its the source from the ftp location. Just follow the wiki.
2007-07-29T15:57:00.000Z	Happu	fyrestrtr	what might be wrong, I get this error while ./cvscompile http://mureakuha.com/paste/?00003b8a521e79bd6b11dc54461a13de
2007-07-29T15:59:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Happu	that's strange, it worked for me on two machines. On what command do you get that error?
2007-07-29T16:12:00.000Z	Happu	fyrestrtr	I got it on ./cvscompile
2007-07-29T16:13:00.000Z	Happu	fyrestrtr	maybe it means that ICH8 isn't supported in alsa?
2007-07-29T16:13:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Happu	maybe.
2007-07-29T15:07:00.000Z	Happu	fyrestrtr	running torrent under wine isn't an option?
