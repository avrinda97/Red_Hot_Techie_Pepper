2005-04-07T07:58:00.000Z	black_nightmare		any of you used 'GNU make' in here?
2005-04-07T07:58:00.000Z	Guilmon	black_nightmare	sorry, I don't use a make utility which sucks ;)
2005-04-07T07:59:00.000Z	Guilmon	black_nightmare	kaffe is very incomplete
2005-04-07T07:59:00.000Z	Guilmon	black_nightmare	ahhhh...
2005-04-07T07:59:00.000Z	Guilmon	black_nightmare	you usually just type make, but what is your question?
2005-04-07T08:01:00.000Z	Guilmon	black_nightmare	heh, everybody has used it
2005-04-07T08:04:00.000Z	Guilmon	black_nightmare	very much, yes..
2005-04-07T08:06:00.000Z	Guilmon	black_nightmare	you need the -dev package
2005-04-07T08:08:00.000Z	Guilmon	black_nightmare	it contains the headers
2005-04-07T08:11:00.000Z	Guilmon	black_nightmare	I do.
2005-04-07T08:12:00.000Z	Guilmon	black_nightmare	you don't have to ask questoins. If its computers,  I know it.
2005-04-07T08:12:00.000Z	Guilmon	black_nightmare	I'm more experienced, thought out, and researched more than your average PhD ;)
2005-04-07T08:12:00.000Z	Guilmon	black_nightmare	just ask away
2005-04-07T08:15:00.000Z	Guilmon	black_nightmare	if it says gtk1.2 or better, make sure it allowed gtk2. gtk2 interface is different from 1.2
2005-04-07T08:15:00.000Z	Guilmon	black_nightmare	there are files already installed, or I thought. but not for -dev
2005-04-07T08:16:00.000Z	Guilmon	black_nightmare	maybe not.
2005-04-07T08:19:00.000Z	Guilmon	black_nightmare	I don't mind
