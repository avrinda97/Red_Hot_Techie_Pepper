2008-07-26T05:45:00.000Z	Cabs	gaelfx_	nope its an rpm file
2008-07-26T05:46:00.000Z	gaelfx_	Cabs	they had no Deb file there/
2008-07-26T05:46:00.000Z	Cabs	gaelfx_	let me check
2008-07-26T05:46:00.000Z	gaelfx_	Cabs	Ubuntu is debian-based, so if they have a deb file, it should work fine, but I don't know how to install rpms in Ubuntu
2008-07-26T05:47:00.000Z	Cabs	gaelfx_	and nickrud http://download.bibblelabs.com/
2008-07-26T05:48:00.000Z	gaelfx_	Cabs	;) there ya go
2008-07-26T05:48:00.000Z	gaelfx_	Cabs	also, make sure that it's the right one for your system, if you're using AMD64 ubuntu, you'll want that package, if x86... you get the idea
2008-07-26T05:51:00.000Z	Cabs	gaelfx_	what do i do once i got the deb file?
2008-07-26T05:51:00.000Z	gaelfx_	Cabs	open it up! you should be able to just double-click it
2008-07-26T05:52:00.000Z	Cabs	gaelfx_	no compiling, no udo dpkg -i --force-architecture <<filename>>.deb ? just double click
2008-07-26T05:53:00.000Z	gaelfx_	Cabs	are you using AMD64 Ubuntu?
2008-07-26T05:55:00.000Z	gaelfx_	Cabs	did it go ok?
2008-07-26T06:02:00.000Z	gaelfx_	Cabs	ah, good, so it worked?
2008-07-26T06:03:00.000Z	gaelfx_	Cabs	glad to have helped
