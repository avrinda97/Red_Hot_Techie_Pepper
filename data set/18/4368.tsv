2011-01-22T01:56:00.000Z	IsmAvatar		Help, GParted isn't seeing SDA, but Ubuntu 10.04 LTS install seems to know it's there....
2011-01-22T01:57:00.000Z	Jordan_U	IsmAvatar	So sda isn't listed in the drop down menu of drives?
2011-01-22T01:57:00.000Z	IsmAvatar	Jordan_U	correct
2011-01-22T01:58:00.000Z	Jordan_U	IsmAvatar	Is it listed in "sudo parted -l"?
2011-01-22T01:58:00.000Z	IsmAvatar	Jordan_U	Error: /dev/sda: unrecognized disk label
2011-01-22T02:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U	IsmAvatar	Do you have any data on sda currently?
2011-01-22T02:01:00.000Z	IsmAvatar	Jordan_U	Quite a lot. I've got Ubuntu 10.10 and WinXP installed on it, have been using it for a while. I have backups, but obviously some info is not backed up and I'd like to get it back.
2011-01-22T02:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	IsmAvatar	Did you do anything recently to the partition table?
2011-01-22T02:06:00.000Z	IsmAvatar	Jordan_U	not that I know of. I didn't do anything to it, and I'm going to guess that Updates don't usually touch it
2011-01-22T02:07:00.000Z	Jordan_U	IsmAvatar	Correct, updates should not touch the partition table. Can you still otherwise use this drive?
2011-01-22T02:08:00.000Z	IsmAvatar	Jordan_U	no. It's got my boot information (grub), and computer booting stops when it would normally reach the Grub screen. I can boot to liveCD (as I am currently). I can't mount the drive. However, Install sees it and says it has no partition table, but lets me partition it if I wanted (tho I won't)
2011-01-22T02:10:00.000Z	Jordan_U	IsmAvatar	Can you check the drive's SMART status in System > Administration > Disk Utility?
2011-01-22T02:12:00.000Z	IsmAvatar	Jordan_U	SMART status: not supported (I think this is normal, as my other HD, which is the same brand, etc also says that)
2011-01-22T02:18:00.000Z	IsmAvatar	Jordan_U	http://img200.imageshack.us/i/sdag.png/ and http://img69.imageshack.us/i/sdbz.png/
2011-01-22T02:20:00.000Z	Jordan_U	IsmAvatar	Wow, that would be the first internal drive I've seen that doesn't support SMART in a long time.
2011-01-22T02:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U	IsmAvatar	Are you using some type of "full disk" encryption?
2011-01-22T02:24:00.000Z	IsmAvatar	Jordan_U	no, only the secondary drive is encrypted
2011-01-22T02:26:00.000Z	Jordan_U	IsmAvatar	I would use testdisk to try to recover the partition table, then if that works treat the drive as being unreliable because it sounds like this problem was likely caused by hardware failure.
