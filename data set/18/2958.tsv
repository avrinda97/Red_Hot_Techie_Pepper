2010-09-03T09:20:00.000Z	thou	saganbyte	do you see a file called 'configure' there?
2010-09-03T09:20:00.000Z	saganbyte	thou	yes there is one
2010-09-03T09:20:00.000Z	thou	saganbyte	ok, this is probably a source package.  so you have to compile it first, then you can install it
2010-09-03T09:20:00.000Z	saganbyte	thou	i see
2010-09-03T09:21:00.000Z	thou	saganbyte	you must have development tools installed first; then you probably run:  ./configure --prefix=/usr && make && sudo make install
2010-09-03T09:22:00.000Z	saganbyte	thou	i ve just installed libtool
2010-09-03T09:22:00.000Z	saganbyte	thou	maybe i ll need some more
2010-09-03T09:22:00.000Z	thou	saganbyte	yeah, probably you will; you can apt-get install build-essentials to start with
2010-09-03T09:22:00.000Z	saganbyte	thou	ok
2010-09-03T09:22:00.000Z	thou	saganbyte	but ... be prepared for a fun evening's worth of learning ;-)
2010-09-03T09:23:00.000Z	saganbyte	thou	that is exactly the objective :)
2010-09-03T09:23:00.000Z	saganbyte	thou	i m not a C/C++ programmer... just installing this thing i got from a linux magazine to learn installing from src
2010-09-03T09:26:00.000Z	saganbyte	thou	after trying to configure , i get stuff like checking for g++... no checking for c++... no, etc... should i install these individually?
2010-09-03T09:28:00.000Z	thou	saganbyte	g++ is part of gcc package
2010-09-03T09:28:00.000Z	saganbyte	thou	ok
2010-09-03T10:12:00.000Z	thou	saganbyte	did you get it to work?
