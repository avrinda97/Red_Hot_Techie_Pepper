2007-11-04T08:39:00.000Z	traveller18		thanks!
2007-11-04T08:41:00.000Z	traveller18		how do you move your home directory?
2007-11-04T08:42:00.000Z	Futsuriai	traveller18	why would you want to do that?
2007-11-04T08:45:00.000Z	Futsuriai	traveller18	so you want to move your /home to a new partition?
2007-11-04T08:45:00.000Z	Futsuriai	traveller18	do you already have a new partition for it?
2007-11-04T08:46:00.000Z	Futsuriai	traveller18	hm, why is it, exactly that your home would be deleted, are you planning on reinstalling from scratch?
2007-11-04T08:48:00.000Z	traveller18	Futsuriai	well i just want to to do but last time when i tried to update from a previous version it didn't work and i had to reinstall it from a cd so its just in case and for in the future so i can have multiple distros share  a home folder
2007-11-04T08:50:00.000Z	Futsuriai	traveller18	I am thinking,
2007-11-04T08:52:00.000Z	Futsuriai	traveller18	how come?
2007-11-04T08:52:00.000Z	Futsuriai	traveller18	i.e. what didn't work?
2007-11-04T08:53:00.000Z	Futsuriai	traveller18	hm
2007-11-04T08:54:00.000Z	Futsuriai	traveller18	so your new partition is empry?
2007-11-04T08:59:00.000Z	Futsuriai	traveller18	about your partition, I don't quite follow, you make a new partition and there's a folder called lost+found on it?
2007-11-04T09:00:00.000Z	Futsuriai	traveller18	ok, so when you mount it and try to do what the guide says, it doesn't copy anything?
2007-11-04T09:02:00.000Z	Futsuriai	traveller18	can you create files in it?
2007-11-04T09:03:00.000Z	Futsuriai	traveller18	what does it say?
2007-11-04T09:05:00.000Z	Futsuriai	traveller18	I meant, open the terminal
