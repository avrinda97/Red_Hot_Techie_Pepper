2005-12-30T16:09:00.000Z	ilba7r	ompaul	i guess you trouble shooted too if the file system was mounted as read only
2005-12-30T16:10:00.000Z	ompaul	ilba7r	it was not mounted when we started this :)
2006-01-21T17:00:00.000Z	ompaul	ilba7r	yes
2006-01-22T15:05:00.000Z	ompaul	ilba7r	fantastic you should also do this
2006-01-22T15:06:00.000Z	ilba7r	ompaul	i am tho one who added dappergoals to ubotu :)
2006-01-22T15:06:00.000Z	ilba7r	ompaul	but i think adding another line will make too long do not you think so
2006-01-22T15:08:00.000Z	ilba7r	ompaul	but we sould not encourge users to test dapper by including it in the factoid. at least that is my opinion
2006-01-27T15:47:00.000Z	ilba7r	ompaul	that is an excellent factoid hope i new about it long ago ;)
2006-01-27T15:47:00.000Z	ompaul	ilba7r	:-)
