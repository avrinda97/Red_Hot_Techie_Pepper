2006-08-22T14:30:00.000Z	tapox		Hi everyone. I need to solve a wifi card issue within four hours, or else I won't have a connection for two weeks.
2006-08-22T14:31:00.000Z	ali1234	tapox	lol. what is the issue? and what card?
2006-08-22T14:33:00.000Z	ali1234	tapox	okay sounds like you have either not configured your secutiry properly for the AP or you have an incompatibility between the card and the AP
2006-08-22T14:33:00.000Z	tapox	ali1234	I don't have security on my AP, it's open. And the router is a linksys as well. I actually had this same setup working before I nuked Ubuntu and later reinstalled it.
2006-08-22T14:34:00.000Z	ali1234	tapox	okay, if it's open, then that is definately not the problem. open always works. i was about to recommend trying it like that
2006-08-22T14:37:00.000Z	ali1234	tapox	it's a tricky one alright. can you get it working with any livecd?
2006-08-22T14:38:00.000Z	tapox	ali1234	Nope. I think the broadcom driver made it into the kernel in 6.06.1 Before that, it wouldn't work, and I had to run a program called bcm43xx-fwcutter to drop the drivers in /lib/firmware
2006-08-22T14:40:00.000Z	ali1234	tapox	it sounds as if before when it worked you used the firmware from the windows drivers? ie the proprietry firmware, but now you are using a totally different open source one?
2006-08-22T14:41:00.000Z	tapox	ali1234	Yep.
2006-08-22T14:42:00.000Z	ali1234	tapox	so perhaps you should continue to use the proprietry one (and try the open source one periodcally to see if it works)
2006-08-22T14:43:00.000Z	tapox	ali1234	But I'm not sure if the kernel will let me override its built in drivers
2006-08-22T14:44:00.000Z	ali1234	tapox	it should be possible to disable the kernel driver
2006-08-22T14:44:00.000Z	ali1234	tapox	did you use ndiswrapper with the old version? or kernel driver + copied firmware?
2006-08-22T14:45:00.000Z	tapox	ali1234	copied firmware route.
2006-08-22T14:46:00.000Z	ali1234	tapox	best bet is to downgrade kernel version then... unless it was a really old kernel
2006-08-22T14:48:00.000Z	ali1234	tapox	i mean if you want to get it working fast. ideally you want to get the newer driver working of course
2006-08-29T08:52:00.000Z	ali1234	tapox	nozorro: /etc/timezone should be a symlink to something in /usr/share/zoneinfo
2006-08-29T08:52:00.000Z	ali1234	tapox	er, /etc/localtime sorry
