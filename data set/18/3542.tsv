2009-09-17T02:10:00.000Z	Loder		What is the best VM software for running ubuntu and fedora on windows? Anyone know?
2009-09-17T02:11:00.000Z	Loder		Well, I have windows vista and I'm not sure of how I should get a triple boot going with fedora and ubuntu (and vista), so somebody suggested that I test with virtual machines
2009-09-17T02:12:00.000Z	Loder		okay, thanks
2009-09-17T02:13:00.000Z	xmnt	Loder	I would use virtualbox - doesn't get any easier, but if you want to triple boot create 3 partitions, install windows 1st and one of the lin distros last so you get the grub bootloader
2009-09-17T02:13:00.000Z	Loder	xmnt	I'm just not quite sure of which distribution to install first. I'm also not sure how large each partition for the linux's should be (/, /home, /boot)
2009-09-17T02:14:00.000Z	xmnt	Loder	I would install windows first .. just use gparted from the livecd to create 3 paritions for about how big you think each will be
2009-09-17T02:16:00.000Z	Loder	xmnt	I already have vista, so should I install ubuntu next, or fedora?
2009-09-17T02:17:00.000Z	xmnt	Loder	either one - it's not really important since you windows is the only 1 that will screw up grub
2009-09-17T02:18:00.000Z	Loder	xmnt	Well I already had ubuntu and windows dual-booting with grub, and when I tried to install fedora I got an error every time. That's why I started from scratch with windows only. Is there something special that you have to do to add fedora to vista and ubuntu?
2009-09-17T02:18:00.000Z	xmnt	Loder	nope ... just 3 different partitions ... maybe your fedora disk has an error ... you can install as many distros as you want on the same hd
2009-09-17T02:19:00.000Z	Loder	xmnt	So You think that if I just install ubuntu and fedora in the free space with each their own automatic configurations, it should work?
2009-09-17T02:20:00.000Z	xmnt	Loder	^^
2009-09-17T02:21:00.000Z	Loder	xmnt	so I have to set up the partitions first? But linux use several partitions, don't they? Like /, /home, /boot, swap?
2009-09-17T02:22:00.000Z	xmnt	Loder	no - thats the file structure ... just use gparted and manually create 3 paritions, 1 for each distro
2009-09-17T02:24:00.000Z	Loder	xmnt	So all I have to do is go create an ext3 partition for each linux distribution? And ubuntu and fedora will set up the other logical drives automatically? Do I have to leave some space for that, or will it use the space that I create inside the ext3 partition?
2009-09-17T02:26:00.000Z	xmnt	Loder	create a partition for both ubuntu and fedora ... installation for each distro will take care of the rest
2009-09-17T02:26:00.000Z	Loder	xmnt	Alright. Maybe it'll work better if I install fedora first. Ubuntu seems to have more options and seems to be more dynamic during installation. Thank you very much for your help
2009-09-17T02:27:00.000Z	xmnt	Loder	n/p
