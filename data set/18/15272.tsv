2006-12-29T14:57:00.000Z	harry	Jazon	do i really have to insert the livecd instead of installing the gparted and remove the windows and then add that paritition to my ubuntu?
2006-12-29T14:58:00.000Z	Jazon	harry	use the livecd.
2006-12-29T14:58:00.000Z	harry	Jazon	why?
2006-12-29T15:00:00.000Z	harry	Jazon	ok, so I dont have to reformat everything but  i can delete the other partition and add it to my current ubuntu w/o reformatting
2006-12-29T15:01:00.000Z	harry	Jazon	ok, so I dont have to reformat everything but  i can delete the other partition and add it to my current ubuntu w/o reformatting?
2006-12-29T15:02:00.000Z	Jazon	harry	dude!  use the livecd!!!!!
2006-12-29T15:02:00.000Z	Jazon	harry	it is painless.  it is only like 32 meg or something
2006-12-29T15:07:00.000Z	harry	Jazon	  anto9us: so whats best you recommend guys?
2006-12-29T15:08:00.000Z	Jazon	harry	best advice?  do a complete backup onto another hdd.  then once you have verified *all* is backed up perfectly, use the gparted livecd to play with your partitions.  if things screw up, you then have your backup :-)
2006-12-29T15:09:00.000Z	harry	Jazon	the problem is I don't have a tool for backing up my huge file.
2006-12-29T15:09:00.000Z	Jazon	harry	what do you mean a tool
2006-12-29T15:09:00.000Z	harry	Jazon	cp? cellphone?
2006-12-29T15:10:00.000Z	harry	Jazon	a writer.. i dont have a thing, and my USB flash drive is only 128 mb
2006-12-29T15:10:00.000Z	Jazon	harry	use gmail or something then
2006-12-29T15:11:00.000Z	Jazon	harry	but backup your data at least.  use hjsplit to break up large data files into 10mb chunks and email them to yourself on your gmail ccount
2006-12-29T15:12:00.000Z	harry	Jazon	thats good, whats hjsplit... i'm really a newbie
2006-12-29T15:13:00.000Z	Jazon	harry	google hjsplit. oh, and the windoze version is easiest - works perfectly inwine
