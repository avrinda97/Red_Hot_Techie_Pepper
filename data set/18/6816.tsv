2009-01-11T17:24:00.000Z	Araneidae		Can I tell the system that I don't want to update a particular component -- and to STOP BUGGING ME ABOUT IT?
2009-01-11T17:24:00.000Z	Araneidae		I downgraded one package (using synaptic), but now Update Manager keeps offering to upgrade it for me!
2009-01-11T17:25:00.000Z	jrib	Araneidae	what is it?  Why don't you want to upgrade it?
2009-01-11T17:30:00.000Z	Araneidae	jrib	wine 1.1.12 breaks things on my machine, so I'm pinning to 1.1.11
2009-01-11T17:30:00.000Z	jrib	Araneidae	so then you know how to pin now?
2009-01-11T17:32:00.000Z	Araneidae	jrib	that sounds helpful.  Thanks
2009-01-11T17:32:00.000Z	Araneidae	jrib	aha: /etc/apt/preferences !
2009-01-11T17:35:00.000Z	Araneidae	jrib	actually (on the linked page), the simple answer is Synaptic -> Package -> Lock Version !

2009-09-13T16:29:00.000Z	Araneidae	jrib	I'm just trying to figure out how important the /dev/sda6 volume is

2009-09-13T16:53:00.000Z	jrib	Araneidae	that's fine.  Create one...
2009-09-13T17:00:00.000Z	jrib	Araneidae	I meant " pastebin your /var/log/Xorg.0.log" for you, but if you have an X problem you should do that too jeromel
