2011-07-08T04:20:00.000Z	rcmaehl		Okay would 'mv ./*/*/*/*/* ./' move all files within the current directory's subdirectories into the current directory?
2011-07-08T04:21:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	rcmaehl	do you want to keep the directory structure or no?
2011-07-08T04:21:00.000Z	rcmaehl	kroq-gar78	no
2011-07-08T04:22:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	rcmaehl	here's what you could try: make a copy of some of your stuff (junk maybe) and try it there
2011-07-08T04:23:00.000Z	rcmaehl	kroq-gar78	it keeps the directory structure but I don't know how to remove the directory structure
2011-07-08T04:27:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	rcmaehl	yes it would, just tried it
2011-07-08T04:30:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	rcmaehl	what's that do? only lets it go into 'x' amount of directorires?
2011-07-08T04:33:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	rcmaehl	and h1gh: thanks im sure that command will be useful sometime in the future :)
2011-07-08T04:33:00.000Z	rcmaehl	kroq-gar78	and h1gh asked in #linux too, they said 'find . -mindepth 2 -type f -exec mv -it . {} +' b/c it doesn't fork mv each time
2011-07-08T04:42:00.000Z	rcmaehl	kroq-gar78	I made a shell script for the command. want it?
2011-07-08T04:42:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	rcmaehl	sure!
2011-07-08T04:42:00.000Z	rcmaehl	kroq-gar78	^

2011-07-09T01:06:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	rcmaehl	as in don't make it show?
2011-07-09T01:07:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	rcmaehl	depends on where you live, COULDnt that be illegal?
2011-07-09T01:07:00.000Z	rcmaehl	kroq-gar78	This is the internet
2011-07-09T01:07:00.000Z	kroq-gar78	rcmaehl	still, there is the real world
