2010-01-15T21:17:00.000Z	JuJuBee		What program can I use to extract the audio tracks from a music video dvd
2010-01-15T21:17:00.000Z	blakkheim	JuJuBee	there are many
2010-01-15T21:17:00.000Z	JuJuBee	blakkheim	reccomend one?
2010-01-15T21:18:00.000Z	blakkheim	JuJuBee	i usually use handbrake to rip the video and then ffmpeg or mplayer to get the audio from that
2010-01-15T21:18:00.000Z	JuJuBee	blakkheim	can ffmpeg or mplayer get audio directly from dvd?
2010-01-15T21:19:00.000Z	blakkheim	JuJuBee	never tried so i can't say
2010-01-15T21:19:00.000Z	blakkheim	JuJuBee	if you can play the dvd in mplayer it can dump just the audio from it to a file
2010-01-15T21:20:00.000Z	JuJuBee	blakkheim	that's cool, but im not familiar with  mplayer... its command line, isn't it?
2010-01-15T21:20:00.000Z	blakkheim	JuJuBee	yes
2010-01-15T21:23:00.000Z	JuJuBee	blakkheim	I see that ffmpeg can get the audio from a .mpg file and dump it as mp3.  Will it create a single mp3 file of all music on dvd?
2010-01-15T21:23:00.000Z	blakkheim	JuJuBee	like i said i've never done it that way so i don't know. i use ffmpeg to rip the audio from video files. even if it rips themm to separate files you could join them together.
2010-01-15T21:25:00.000Z	JuJuBee	blakkheim	I would prefer separate files, but either way...  I will give handbrake and ffmpeg a try thanks.
2010-01-15T21:26:00.000Z	JuJuBee	blakkheim	do you know if there is a 9.04 64 bit version?  only see 9.10 on site
2010-01-15T21:26:00.000Z	blakkheim	JuJuBee	it will probably work just fine, or you could compile from the sources
2010-01-15T21:28:00.000Z	JuJuBee	blakkheim	I think the .deb file is for 9.10, errors trying dpkg -i  need newer libraries than I have....
2010-01-15T21:29:00.000Z	blakkheim	JuJuBee	oh ok, then i guess you've gotta compile it
2010-01-15T21:29:00.000Z	blakkheim	JuJuBee	or update :/
2010-01-15T21:29:00.000Z	JuJuBee	blakkheim	can't update to 9.10... problems with mouse/trackpad  prevent it with 9.10
