2008-11-29T01:48:00.000Z	[TiZ]		Change intrepid to hardy then
2008-11-29T01:49:00.000Z	[TiZ]		It's his choice, let him be.
2008-11-29T01:50:00.000Z	[TiZ]		Me either. I have an Xpress 1150 driving a little 1280x800 display
2008-11-29T01:51:00.000Z	[TiZ]		Alrighty then... So open drivers aren't giving you 1680x1050?
2008-11-29T01:51:00.000Z	[TiZ]		You could try fglrx
2008-11-29T01:52:00.000Z	[TiZ]		I'm using fglrx now, and I've used open drivers since hardy
2008-11-29T01:52:00.000Z	[TiZ]		It seems that fglrx is a little nicer to the xpress cards now.
2008-11-29T01:52:00.000Z	[TiZ]		Ah, sorry.
2008-11-29T01:53:00.000Z	[TiZ]		Basically, once you install it, you'll get a little notification that says restricted drivers are available
2008-11-29T01:53:00.000Z	[TiZ]		That's where you can install "fglrx", the name for ATI's proprietary driver
2008-11-29T01:54:00.000Z	draco1234	[TiZ]	DaddyDave, I think it will automatically try to install and activate fglrx if you try to enable desktop effects in the "appearance" settings
2008-11-29T01:55:00.000Z	[TiZ]	draco1234	It shouldn't in 8.10, if the open drivers give 3d acceleration for your card.
2008-11-29T01:56:00.000Z	draco1234	[TiZ]	it did for me.... even now, when I turn on desktop effects, it spends about 10 seconds saying "searching for drivers" before it realizes I already have fglrx...
2008-11-29T01:56:00.000Z	[TiZ]	draco1234	Something's not right there. What kind of video card do you have?
2008-11-29T01:57:00.000Z	draco1234	[TiZ]	Well, it works fine, but it's a Mobility Radeon X1300
2008-11-29T01:58:00.000Z	[TiZ]	draco1234	That's weird. I've installed ubuntu several times on this laptop and not once has it done anything like that to me.
2008-11-29T01:59:00.000Z	draco1234	[TiZ]	so special effects are enabled, in the "appearance" program on the "visual effects" tab?
2008-11-29T02:00:00.000Z	[TiZ]	draco1234	I have custom enabled there, 'cos I installed simple-ccsm. Also, I have fusion-icon installed and in my sessions, so it starts compiz twice. :P
