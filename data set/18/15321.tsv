2005-04-12T05:51:00.000Z	kpeterson	adobbie	yeah MX500 I think
2005-04-12T05:51:00.000Z	kpeterson	adobbie	700 actually
2005-04-12T05:52:00.000Z	adobbie	kpeterson	you need to edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2005-04-12T05:52:00.000Z	kpeterson	adobbie	k hold on
2005-04-12T05:52:00.000Z	adobbie		join #flood
2005-04-12T05:52:00.000Z	kpeterson	adobbie	actually I was following this: http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/ManyButtonsMouseHowto but its says something about modifying /etc/X11/Xsession.d/60imwheel_start-imwheel and I get lost
2005-04-12T05:53:00.000Z	adobbie	kpeterson	I'm not sure you need imwheel
2005-04-12T05:53:00.000Z	adobbie		my forward/back works in Mozilla already without it
2005-04-12T05:53:00.000Z	kpeterson	adobbie	I was hoping to get it working with IM wheel since I have other plans for the buttons
2005-04-12T05:54:00.000Z	adobbie	kpeterson	you have an ~/.imwheelrc ?
2005-04-12T05:56:00.000Z	kpeterson	adobbie	yeah
2005-04-12T05:57:00.000Z	kpeterson	adobbie	its just the part i mentioned that im confused about
2005-04-12T05:57:00.000Z	adobbie	kpeterson	I think you just need to create the config and then run imwheel to get the features
2005-04-12T05:58:00.000Z	kpeterson		adobbie
2005-04-12T05:58:00.000Z	kpeterson	adobbie	ok
