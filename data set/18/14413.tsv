2005-08-02T14:32:00.000Z	nevin		why not just a live cd?
2005-08-02T14:33:00.000Z	[madman] 	nevin	 livecd exists - but can't install from it
2005-08-02T14:36:00.000Z	[madman] 	nevin	 i mean session should be saved every 30 seconds for example
2005-08-02T14:37:00.000Z	[madman] 	nevin	 or some tool to remotely save gnome session
2005-08-02T14:37:00.000Z	[madman] 	nevin	 like gnome-session-shutdown
2005-08-02T14:38:00.000Z	[madman] 	nevin	 from shutdown script
2005-08-02T14:38:00.000Z	[madman] 	nevin	 i'm used to press the power button to shutdown the computer
2005-08-02T14:39:00.000Z	[madman] 	nevin	 so my session is never saved
2005-08-02T14:39:00.000Z	[madman] 	nevin	 i'd like to have a way to save it
2005-08-02T14:40:00.000Z	[madman] 	nevin	 well... no problem, but i'd have to hack gnome-session a bit to detect if the session was saved
2005-08-02T14:40:00.000Z	[madman] 	nevin	 well... quite a good idea, too
2005-08-02T14:41:00.000Z	[madman] 	nevin	 but I think gnome should have such a feature built in
2005-08-02T14:41:00.000Z	[madman] 	nevin	 (no, kde doesn't do it - no, xfce neither;)
2005-08-02T14:45:00.000Z	[madman] 	nevin	 yes, i can do anything i want on acpi events
2005-08-02T14:45:00.000Z	[madman] 	nevin	 but don't yet know how to remotely shutdown gnome
2005-08-02T14:45:00.000Z	[madman] 	nevin	 without asking user a confirmation
2005-08-02T14:48:00.000Z	[madman] 	nevin	 thanks, will try it out
2005-08-02T14:51:00.000Z	[madman] 	nevin	 i'll hack on the scripts and file a patch on the ubuntu bugzilla
