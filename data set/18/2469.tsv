2010-06-04T02:35:00.000Z	Appl6	j2daosh	Are you trying to connect with WEP or WPA?
2010-06-04T02:35:00.000Z	Appl6	j2daosh	Can you be more specific about what "doesn't work" means?
2010-06-04T02:35:00.000Z	Appl6	j2daosh	I read them.  Where does yours differ from what's expected?
2010-06-04T02:38:00.000Z	Appl6	j2daosh	Did you run it with -d?
2010-06-04T02:39:00.000Z	j2daosh	Appl6	i did not. all i did was 'dhclient wlan0'; i will try with the d flag now
2010-06-04T02:43:00.000Z	j2daosh	Appl6	still receive "No DHCPOFFERS" when using 'dhclient -d wlan0'; Clearly i am missing something, but I just dont know what it is i'm doing wrong. I did the ifconfig up wlan0, the iwconfig wlan0 essid name;iwconfig wlan0 key "key";iwlist wlan0 scan (to verify the AP was seen);iwconfig (review the config); ifconfig wlan0 up;dhclient wlan0 (and dhclient -d wlan0);, i still can't get connected
2010-06-04T02:44:00.000Z	Appl6	j2daosh	Can you double check that the router is configured for DHCP?
2010-06-04T02:45:00.000Z	j2daosh	Appl6	it is. before i deleted network-manager, it worked just fine. i installed arping for some stupid reason and it removed my network-manager and so began the saga of trying to get internet back without having to reinstall
2010-06-04T02:46:00.000Z	Appl6	j2daosh	Do an "iwconfig wlan0" after the essid/key setting to make sure you're associated with the access point.
2010-06-04T02:46:00.000Z	j2daosh	Appl6	where will it say associated at? i dont see that
2010-06-04T02:47:00.000Z	Appl6	j2daosh	It will say "Access Point: "
2010-06-04T02:47:00.000Z	Appl6	j2daosh	Can you pastebin it please?
2010-06-04T02:49:00.000Z	Appl6	j2daosh	You don't see the "Access Point: " line in iwconfig wlan0?
2010-06-04T02:49:00.000Z	j2daosh	Appl6	i only see "Access Point: 00:23:69:20:80:FF
2010-06-04T02:50:00.000Z	Appl6	j2daosh	OK, that's fine.
2010-06-04T02:50:00.000Z	Appl6	j2daosh	Ironically, I'm having exactly the same problem on another machine.  dhclient isn't getting any offers from my router.
2010-06-04T02:51:00.000Z	j2daosh	Appl6	you would think networking would be stable by now
2010-06-04T02:54:00.000Z	Appl6	j2daosh	Maybe you can try a static IP: http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/howto-ubuntu-linux-convert-dhcp-network-configuration-to-static-ip-configuration.html
