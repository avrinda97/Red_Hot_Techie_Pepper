2007-10-05T11:26:00.000Z	jumbalia		Should I install fiesty now and upgrade to gutsy when it comes out, or just wait for gutsy, or install gutsy now?
2007-10-05T11:27:00.000Z	jumbalia		well, i am almost a cmplete newb to linux
2007-10-05T11:27:00.000Z	jumbalia		I have done minor minor server administration before
2007-10-05T11:27:00.000Z	jumbalia		and messed around a bit with ubuntu
2007-10-05T11:27:00.000Z	jumbalia		i didn't know if upgrading would be as "clean" as installing new
2007-10-05T11:28:00.000Z	eyec0n	jumbalia	just change "fiesty" to "gutsy" and its done.
2007-10-05T11:33:00.000Z	eyec0n	jumbalia	long as its on a seperate partition i dont see a problem...
2007-10-05T11:35:00.000Z	eyec0n	jumbalia	what do you need in centos thats not in ubuntu?
2007-10-05T11:38:00.000Z	eyec0n	jumbalia	use the live cd so you can unmount your hard-drive and then use the partition manager in system >
2007-10-05T11:39:00.000Z	jumbalia	eyec0n	is it better to multi-partition?  If so, why?
2007-10-05T11:40:00.000Z	eyec0n	jumbalia	I dont think its possable to install windows/ubuntu/centos on one partition... so you have to use multiple partitions
2007-10-05T11:41:00.000Z	jumbalia	eyec0n	disregard the triple boot.  I was told I should multi-partiton for one installation of ubuntu
2007-10-05T11:42:00.000Z	jumbalia	eyec0n	I was told to put each "/" (/ome, /etc, etc) in its own partition
2007-10-05T11:45:00.000Z	eyec0n	jumbalia	if you want to install windows/ubuntu/centos you need a partition for windows, a partition for swap, a partition for ubuntu and a partition for cent os
2007-10-05T11:45:00.000Z	jumbalia	eyec0n	kk
2007-10-05T11:52:00.000Z	eyec0n	jumbalia	you kinda hit the nail on the head... "do the same thing, just different ways of doing it"
2007-10-05T11:54:00.000Z	eyec0n	jumbalia	if you want to win that arguement with your roommate tell him bm43xx finally works.
2007-10-05T11:54:00.000Z	jumbalia	eyec0n	I will.  if I get a balck eye, I'm coming for you :P
