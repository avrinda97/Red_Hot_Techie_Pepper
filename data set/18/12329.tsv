2006-05-04T06:30:00.000Z	stevietool	monomaniacpat	where <eth*> stands for your wirelles card
2006-05-04T06:32:00.000Z	monomaniacpat	stevietool	OK, I've gedit'd it, what do I add? http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/13059
2006-05-04T06:34:00.000Z	stevietool	monomaniacpat	if you do ifconfig...what's the name of your wireless eth0/eth1 ?
2006-05-04T06:44:00.000Z	monomaniacpat	stevietool	are you still there? Anyone else know how to set the wireless card to start at start up?
2006-05-04T06:53:00.000Z	stevietool	monomaniacpat	looks good, paste it under "primary network interfaces (maybe auto-wlan0 on top of the rules)
2006-05-04T06:54:00.000Z	monomaniacpat	stevietool	sorry, what exactly do you want me to do (sorry for being dense)?
2006-05-04T06:55:00.000Z	stevietool	monomaniacpat	was that your config under /etc/network/interfaces?
2006-05-04T06:57:00.000Z	monomaniacpat	stevietool	refresh the page, I have put the whole file up for your perusal
2006-05-04T06:59:00.000Z	stevietool	monomaniacpat	well I think you have to put the rule auto wlan0 at the beginning not at the end
2006-05-04T07:16:00.000Z	stevietool	monomaniacpat	yo is it fixed?
2006-05-04T07:19:00.000Z	stevietool	monomaniacpat	when you do sudo ifup wlan0 it works?
2006-05-04T07:20:00.000Z	monomaniacpat	stevietool	I've been using network settings dialogue
2006-05-04T07:23:00.000Z	stevietool	monomaniacpat	can you try the command : sudo ifup wlan0 in a terminal?
2006-05-04T07:28:00.000Z	stevietool	monomaniacpat	what does the command give?
2006-05-04T07:29:00.000Z	monomaniacpat	stevietool	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/13063
2006-05-04T07:32:00.000Z	stevietool	monomaniacpat	hmm it's the right name of the interface you've put in the interface-config
