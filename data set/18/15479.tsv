2006-07-24T12:24:00.000Z	tsume	raj	nah, its a good attempt. However the lame assed amswer I think It was yazzy, got back was.. "there are legal restrictions why we can't build pacakges" which is a ton of bs
2006-07-24T12:25:00.000Z	tsume	raj	Personally, I recommend using FreeBSD and building source yourself. You have used gentoo, right?
2006-07-24T12:26:00.000Z	raj	tsume	nope
2006-07-24T12:26:00.000Z	tsume	raj	its not hard, you just have to wait for code to build. and the plus is you get the latest and greatest stuff :)
2006-07-24T12:26:00.000Z	raj	tsume	 will gentoo work well with dual boot?
2006-07-24T12:27:00.000Z	tsume	raj	I was talking about freevsd :)
2006-07-24T12:27:00.000Z	tsume	raj	gentoo is okay. I just perfer BSD personally.
2006-07-24T12:27:00.000Z	tsume	raj	linux is just a tool, bsd is my os :)
2006-07-24T12:27:00.000Z	raj	tsume	 kool freebsd next :)
2006-07-24T12:28:00.000Z	tsume	raj	the only sad thing mono doesn't run well on any BSD. Its mono's fault for it however.
2006-07-24T12:29:00.000Z	tsume	raj	laters
2006-07-24T12:29:00.000Z	raj	tsume	 ty
