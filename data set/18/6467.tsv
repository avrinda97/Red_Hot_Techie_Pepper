2008-08-23T10:05:00.000Z	tj83		anyone know if there are any command line web browsers that are not 100% text? is this possible without a X-server installed? I would like to view a local webserver with as minimal resources as possible
2008-08-23T10:06:00.000Z	Dr_willis	tj83	 lynx and links both had a framebuffer/gui version I recall.
2008-08-23T10:06:00.000Z	Dr_willis	tj83	 i think there may be another also that can do framebuffer gfx
2008-08-23T10:07:00.000Z	Dr_willis	tj83	 dont expect any fancy features. :) like flash/java/ect.. of course..
2008-08-23T10:11:00.000Z	tj83	Dr_willis	hmm you mentioned framebuffer, i'm kinda newb, would this pose a security risk on my firewall with links2? framebuffer overflows?
2008-08-23T10:12:00.000Z	Dr_willis	tj83	 the framebuffer is  a generic way of having graphics on the console. You are thinking of a 'buffer overflow' of memory.. Not the same thing.
2008-08-23T10:13:00.000Z	Dr_willis	tj83	 framebuffer was to be like a replacement for the old 'svga' type graphics from years back
2008-08-23T10:13:00.000Z	tj83	Dr_willis	ok, just triggered a partial memory, thanks for clearing that up.
2008-08-23T10:14:00.000Z	Dr_willis	tj83	 Just having a webserver on the firewall.. could be considered more of a security issue i imagine..
2008-08-23T10:15:00.000Z	tj83	Dr_willis	well, i'm running Endian stand along for firewall IDS, the interface is web-based, but only to the LAN, (green interface)
2008-08-23T10:16:00.000Z	tj83	Dr_willis	i can view from client machines but if i wanted i would like to view local on that box. reason i was asking, appreciate the input.
2009-03-09T23:36:00.000Z	Dr_willis	tj83	  save the menu.lst that each linux os generates somewhere.. and pick ONE os to handle the grub loader.. manually edit that os's menu.lst and add the proper entries to the end of the menu.lst
2009-03-09T23:37:00.000Z	Dr_willis	tj83	 sdaveing each os's menu.lst lets you look in them to see what they use for boot options and so forth. updating kernels on the other os's may have issues however.
2009-03-09T23:37:00.000Z	tj83	Dr_willis	thanks for your reply... yes.. i understand this... I have already handled multi booting linux OS , My real issue lies in the stinkin windows bootloader and i have no idea how to get the info to import it into grub manually.
2009-03-09T23:38:00.000Z	Dr_willis	tj83	 theres exmaples in the menu.lst for windows on various hard drives..  shouldent be too hard to do. You just need to change the hd## info
2009-03-09T23:39:00.000Z	tj83	Dr_willis	ok, i will dig deeper.... i can boot all the os's ok... it just bothers me to use one bootloader to load another bootloader and the fact that its MS bootloader makes it even worse :P
2009-03-09T23:40:00.000Z	Dr_willis	tj83	 in some ways thats safer.. :) but it all depends on what you do. You could uise the pc's bios menus to pick what HD to boot. if you have each os on its own hd.
2009-03-09T23:40:00.000Z	tj83	Dr_willis	ya, all on same HDD
