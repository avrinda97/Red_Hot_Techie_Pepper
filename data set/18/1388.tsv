2011-03-06T01:36:00.000Z	Warwolt		Hello, I've installed Windows XP And want to dual boot Linux. When I read some tutorials there's supposed to be a "free space" under the device menu in Alloca drive space. I've been trying to use Gparted to make the XP partition smaller but it won't allow me to. What do I do?

2011-03-06T01:42:00.000Z	yeats	Warwolt	have you done this?: http://www.ehow.com/how_5124581_shrink-windows-xp-partition.html
2011-03-06T01:44:00.000Z	Warwolt	yeats	I tried to accses the XP partition through Gparted on my USB ubuntu but it won't allow me to resize it
2011-03-06T01:44:00.000Z	yeats	Warwolt	what happens when you try?
2011-03-06T01:44:00.000Z	Warwolt	yeats	I can only move it 10mb (which seems to be the free space I have right now) and if I try to manually write in a smaller number it just ignores me and rewrites the original number
2011-03-06T01:46:00.000Z	yeats	Warwolt	(this is veering outside the scope of this channel a bit, but) you may be able to get more space by defragging windows (sometimes more than once)
2011-03-06T01:47:00.000Z	Warwolt	yeats	Perhaps, but the thing is that right now about 99gig of my 100gig is the partition for XP. I need to make it about 50gig or so
2011-03-06T01:48:00.000Z	yeats	Warwolt	did you say this was a new WinXP install?  if so, could you delete the windows partition, use gparted to create partitions, then reinstall windows in a 40 GB or so partition (depending on your needs)?
2011-03-06T01:49:00.000Z	Warwolt	yeats	Yeah, I only just got done updating and installing some drivers, so, redoing this isn't too much of a hastle. So I just remove the partition alltogther and redo it as a 40gig partitoin? (Or whatever size I feel I need)
2011-03-06T01:50:00.000Z	yeats	Warwolt	yes - you can delete it with Gparted
2011-03-06T01:50:00.000Z	Warwolt	yeats	Done, so now XP is completely gone? I'm making a new one and get to size it up, choosing 40gig
2011-03-06T01:51:00.000Z	yeats	Warwolt	sounds good
2011-03-06T01:52:00.000Z	Warwolt	yeats	How much should I leave completely unpartitioned? I've heard its good partice to leave some for rescuemissions
2011-03-06T01:57:00.000Z	yeats	Warwolt	it depends on what you mean by "rescuemissions" - I don't do that because I have an external USB drive for backups of my data - if you have that, you may not need reserve space
