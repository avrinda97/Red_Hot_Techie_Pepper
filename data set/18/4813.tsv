2010-07-19T06:11:00.000Z	DasEi	lostnhell	you want to keep the current grub or have no grub at all ?
2010-07-19T06:11:00.000Z	lostnhell	DasEi	I have grub installed from another OS, I don't want ubuntu to have any bootloader
2010-07-19T06:11:00.000Z	DasEi	lostnhell	but ubuntu is already installed ?
2010-07-19T06:12:00.000Z	lostnhell	DasEi	It is installed, but I declined installation of grub2, modified my chosen bootloader to boot ubuntu then removed the grub files from ubuntu
2010-07-19T06:12:00.000Z	DasEi	lostnhell	so simple apt-get remove any grub packages, you should be fine
2010-07-19T06:13:00.000Z	lostnhell	DasEi	I already did that, but the update utility is already prompting to install grub
2010-07-19T06:14:00.000Z	DasEi	lostnhell	what does a : grub-version   report ?
2010-07-19T06:14:00.000Z	lostnhell	DasEi	command not found, because I removed grub-pc and grub-common
2010-07-19T06:20:00.000Z	DasEi	lostnhell	trick situation, might try dselect to make grub unavailable, else dpkg-hold came to mind, but as there is no package, can neither blacklist updating nor hold it, never had that situation
2010-07-19T06:20:00.000Z	lostnhell	DasEi	dpkg hold and aptitude hold both failed to block it
2010-07-19T06:21:00.000Z	DasEi	lostnhell	sure, as there IS no package to hold, try to remove grub by dselect
2010-07-19T06:21:00.000Z	lostnhell	DasEi	blendmaster1024, I think I found the answer, I modified /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/01autoremove in the "Never-MarkAuto-Sections" by adding the line "grub*", now it is now showing to be installed or upgraded
2010-07-19T06:23:00.000Z	DasEi	lostnhell	did you crete that file ? couldn't  find on my sys
2010-07-19T06:24:00.000Z	DasEi	lostnhell	sry, my bad, typo
2010-07-19T06:25:00.000Z	lostnhell	DasEi	I just had to look around a bit to find the option, It is amazing that I couldn't find documentation for that anywhere, I have been searching the net for a week
2010-07-19T06:26:00.000Z	DasEi	lostnhell	newland to me, too, so can't give advice to that solution
2010-07-19T06:28:00.000Z	lostnhell	DasEi	thank you for your help anyway, now that I got this resolved ubuntu may stay on my system for more than a month this time
2010-07-19T06:29:00.000Z	DasEi	lostnhell	blacklist from upgrading is in the apt-howto, but didn't find how to prevent a package from the base-install, so nice hint
