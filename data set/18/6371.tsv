2008-05-18T05:01:00.000Z	hieu		how do i enable the "universe" repository in ubuntu 7.10?
2008-05-18T05:02:00.000Z	Glovern	hieu	System > Administration > Software Sources
2008-05-18T05:03:00.000Z	Glovern	hieu	Under Third-Party software.
2008-05-18T05:04:00.000Z	Glovern	hieu	Check the first one.
2008-05-18T05:05:00.000Z	Glovern	hieu	Err, what is the first one for you?
2008-05-18T05:05:00.000Z	Glovern	hieu	Yeah, that's it.
2008-05-18T05:06:00.000Z	Glovern	hieu	Yep.
2008-05-18T05:06:00.000Z	Glovern	hieu	Yep.
2008-05-18T05:07:00.000Z	Glovern	hieu	I think you'll need to be online...
2008-05-18T05:07:00.000Z	Glovern	hieu	Did you already try connecting?
2008-05-18T05:08:00.000Z	Glovern	hieu	I didn't set up my own connection, so I can offer any advice.
2008-05-18T05:08:00.000Z	Glovern	hieu	*can't
2008-05-18T05:09:00.000Z	Glovern	hieu	The ethernet doesn't work? Maybe the hardware isn't supported...
2008-05-18T05:11:00.000Z	Glovern	hieu	Well, if it doesn't detect being plugged into a router/modem, there's no solution other than maybe downloading drivers onto a USB drive, which I have no idea how you'd do.
2008-05-18T05:12:00.000Z	Glovern	hieu	You could install from source if you have it on a drive.
2008-05-18T05:14:00.000Z	Glovern	hieu	Download the source and install from that with $ make install.
2008-05-18T05:14:00.000Z	Glovern	hieu	Ask around for more info, I'm leaving this chat.
2008-05-18T05:14:00.000Z	Glovern	hieu	You'll figure it out, good luck.
