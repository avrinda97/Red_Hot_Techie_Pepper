2009-04-23T01:14:00.000Z	thasp		I have a folder with all my music in it, in tons of sorted subfolders
2009-04-23T01:14:00.000Z	thasp		i need to take only the flacs, and convert them to vorbis
2009-04-23T01:14:00.000Z	thasp		i tried soundconverter but there is no easy way to remove the mp3s and oggs from the list
2009-04-23T01:14:00.000Z	thasp		i only want to transcode the flacs to oggs, is there a simple way to do that while leaving the mp3s and oggs in the folder out?
2009-04-23T01:15:00.000Z	blackest	thasp	i've a method you could use
2009-04-23T01:15:00.000Z	thasp		i don't have any in mind at the moment
2009-04-23T01:15:00.000Z	thasp		i am thinking something using find *.flac then piping that to oggenc
2009-04-23T01:16:00.000Z	thasp		in windows i used to do a search for *.flac, drag and drop the files to foobar2000, and use that to convert
2009-04-23T01:16:00.000Z	thasp		if i could drag and drop all the *flac and all the *ape files to soundconverter, that would make my day
2009-04-23T01:16:00.000Z	thasp	hbekel	you mean $f.ogg, right?
2009-04-23T01:17:00.000Z	thasp		thanks a lot
2009-04-23T01:17:00.000Z	thasp		i can build something on that
2009-04-23T01:17:00.000Z	thasp		is there a way i can just move all the flacs and apes into one folder?
2009-04-23T01:18:00.000Z	thasp		i guess i can using a variant of that command, thanks
2009-04-23T01:19:00.000Z	thasp	hbekel	will that be recursive, since they're all in subdirectories?
2009-04-23T01:19:00.000Z	thasp		i did this before with some commandline using "find"
2009-04-23T01:20:00.000Z	thasp		thanks
2009-04-23T01:22:00.000Z	blackest	thasp	 find . -name '*.mp3'-type f -exec mv '{}' . \ drops all mp3's out the subfolders to the base dir but if there are dups they will get wiped
