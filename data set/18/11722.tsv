2006-11-06T07:25:00.000Z	compengi		i'm now running dapper i'm planning to format and install edgy, and i want someone's opinion, should i do it or it's still early because there are many problems in edgy
2006-11-06T07:25:00.000Z	Hobbsee	compengi	as long as you havent used automatix, or installed beryl, you'll be fine to upgrade to edgy.  formatting and installing works fine, anyway.
2006-11-06T07:26:00.000Z	Hobbsee	compengi	edgy wont change much from what it si nwo
2006-11-06T07:38:00.000Z	Hobbsee	compengi	run sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop from a terminal.  and dont do that again.
2006-11-06T07:38:00.000Z	Hobbsee	compengi	if you're removing python, something bad is happening.
2006-11-06T07:38:00.000Z	compengi	Hobbsee	the uninstalled thing did that
2006-11-06T07:39:00.000Z	Hobbsee	compengi	yes, exactly.  libgtkhtml-2.0 is a lib that you need to keep.
2006-11-06T07:39:00.000Z	compengi	Hobbsee	when i installed it again it didn't install the other files that it had removed
2006-11-06T07:40:00.000Z	Hobbsee	compengi	no, it wouldnt.  you'll need to install ubuntu desktop again.  i can explain it if you want
2006-11-06T07:40:00.000Z	compengi	Hobbsee	yes please
2006-11-06T07:41:00.000Z	compengi	Hobbsee	it had finished
2006-11-06T07:42:00.000Z	compengi	Hobbsee	yeah and the add/remove returned :)
2006-11-06T07:42:00.000Z	Hobbsee	compengi	ubuntu, and other metapackages is kind of like a kiddy brick tower.  or that "pick up sticks" game, i think.  removing a lib like libgtkhtml-2.0 is like removing the bottom brick - expect all the stuff on top to need to be removed as well.  yet, when you only add the bottom brick again, it doesnt add the top bricks.  and ubuntu-desktop is the top brick of all.
2006-11-06T07:43:00.000Z	compengi	Hobbsee	wow i see :)
2006-11-06T07:43:00.000Z	Hobbsee	compengi	:)
2006-11-06T07:43:00.000Z	compengi	Hobbsee	but nothing important had happened :)
2006-11-06T07:43:00.000Z	Hobbsee	compengi	hmmm?
2006-11-06T07:45:00.000Z	compengi	Hobbsee	btw do you know a command trick that will install all the files needed to be able to use a program or compile it?
