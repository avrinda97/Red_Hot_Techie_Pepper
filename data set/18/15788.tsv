2005-04-10T07:08:00.000Z	Nemo_		Can anyone here point me in the direction of the source code for the linux kernel that is shipped with hoary hedgehog current? (5.04 i386) I can't find it on ubuntulinux.com or the mirrors.
2005-04-10T07:09:00.000Z	Nemo_		No, I want the exact source that is compiled on the cd.
2005-04-10T07:09:00.000Z	Nemo_		I cannot find it on ubuntulinux.com
2005-04-10T07:10:00.000Z	Nemo_		Where is the source package then?
2005-04-10T07:12:00.000Z	Nemo_		ftp://username:password@example.org/directory/
2005-04-10T07:13:00.000Z	Nemo_		I am not, I need the source so that I can install a network driver
2005-04-10T07:14:00.000Z	Nemo_		And, as per the GPL, the source should be not only on ubuntulinux.org, but also on every mirror.
2005-04-10T07:15:00.000Z	Nemo_		And it's not a vanilla kernel.  All I see is a diff file that I can download through ftp/http.
2005-04-10T07:15:00.000Z	Nemo_		I need to install a network driver, I need the kernel source, the version that comes with hoary 5.04.
2005-04-10T07:16:00.000Z	Nemo_		The presence of a kernel*.diff file tells me that I can't get it from kernel.org
2005-04-10T07:16:00.000Z	eyequeue	Nemo_	 s/kernel/linux/
2005-04-10T07:18:00.000Z	eyequeue	Nemo_	 right
2005-04-10T07:20:00.000Z	eyequeue	Nemo_	 wget  http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/l/linux-source-2.6.10/linux-source-2.6.10_2.6.10-31_all.deb
2005-04-10T07:20:00.000Z	eyequeue	Nemo_	 just wget  http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/l/linux-source-2.6.10/linux-source-2.6.10_2.6.10-31_all.deb
2005-04-10T07:22:00.000Z	eyequeue	Nemo_	 will what i said suffice for you?
2005-04-10T07:23:00.000Z	eyequeue	Nemo_	 that same directory contains an .orig.tar.gz and a .diff.gz if you prefer
2005-04-10T07:24:00.000Z	eyequeue	Nemo_	 in any case, the gpl mandates the sounce be available, and ubuntu discharges that obligation in that directory
2005-04-10T07:25:00.000Z	eyequeue	Nemo_	 no, i'm just pointing out there's an obligation, even if you were not aware :)
