2012-01-29T01:29:00.000Z	applepie		hello
2012-01-29T01:30:00.000Z	applepie		can you read this?
2012-01-29T01:30:00.000Z	applepie		I have a problem
2012-01-29T01:30:00.000Z	applepie		can i have help?
2012-01-29T01:30:00.000Z	applepie		!patience | mongy
2012-01-29T01:32:00.000Z	applepie		how do i compile a c++ program? without make?
2012-01-29T01:32:00.000Z	applepie		I normaly use make, but now i'm on windows
2012-01-29T01:32:00.000Z	applepie		and i must build.
2012-01-29T01:33:00.000Z	nopf	applepie	install ubuntu in virtualbox ?
2012-01-29T01:33:00.000Z	applepie	nopf	it will take a lot of time to build a 6,000 lines program.
2012-01-29T01:35:00.000Z	nopf	applepie	not really. with modern processor virtualizing extensions the performance loss is <= 2 i'd suppose. anyhow i was mostly joking. the real question is: why you use windows? why ask here? you only want c++ where you have windows and cannot reinstall? then vbox *is* an solution
2012-01-29T01:35:00.000Z	applepie	nopf	it should be both win/ubuntu, but i can't dualbot
2012-01-29T01:36:00.000Z	nopf	applepie	exactly then develop under a OS designed for software development, even if it's in a vbox :) ... or use cywin with g++ ...
2012-01-29T01:38:00.000Z	applepie	nopf	crappy dualcore 1.6ghz, my friend :(
2012-01-29T01:38:00.000Z	nopf	applepie	*cygwin* i ment... or use something like kdevelop. never used it on windows, but it says it'll work
2012-01-29T01:39:00.000Z	applepie	nopf	thanks, i'll get along with cygwin
2012-01-29T01:39:00.000Z	nopf	applepie	and yes, i have a 1.6ghz atom *with* virtualization extensions that runs qemu exactly as fast as a 4 ghz 64bit system with 4 times as much ram and no hardware virtualization support
2012-01-29T01:40:00.000Z	applepie	nopf	mine does not have virtualization tech.
