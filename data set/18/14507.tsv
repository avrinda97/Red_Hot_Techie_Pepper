2005-07-20T10:00:00.000Z	Bubbling_Zombie		if you have the 2.6.10 kernel yes
2005-07-20T10:01:00.000Z	Bubbling_Zombie		(you can find out that with uname -a )
2005-07-20T10:02:00.000Z	Bubbling_Zombie		you don't even have to do that
2005-07-20T10:02:00.000Z	Bubbling_Zombie		:)
2005-07-20T10:02:00.000Z	Bubbling_Zombie		just do (on a terminal) "modprobe nvidia"
2005-07-20T10:02:00.000Z	Bubbling_Zombie		and try starting X
2005-07-20T10:02:00.000Z	Bubbling_Zombie		great
2005-07-20T10:02:00.000Z	Bubbling_Zombie		try starting x :F
2005-07-20T10:03:00.000Z	Bubbling_Zombie		why not tanki?
2005-07-20T10:03:00.000Z	Bubbling_Zombie		it's not like they're gona modprobe themselves -_-
2005-07-20T10:03:00.000Z	tanki	Bubbling_Zombie	you should have them loaded before you start x
2005-07-20T10:05:00.000Z	Bubbling_Zombie	tanki	of course it's safer. But it isn't absolutely nec. if you know what you're doing
2005-07-20T10:06:00.000Z	tanki	Bubbling_Zombie	when dealing with nvidia drivers, you never know
2005-07-20T10:07:00.000Z	Bubbling_Zombie	tanki	sure.
2005-07-20T10:12:00.000Z	Bubbling_Zombie	tanki	but what about transparent toolbars :sop: :')
2005-07-20T10:14:00.000Z	tanki	Bubbling_Zombie	it's always been a struggle because linux is so perfect for the desktop compared to windows, and some might say even osx.. so it's only natural that we would want to game on it with the same advantage but sadly that wont happen, not with intellectual property rights and big lawyers
2005-07-20T10:17:00.000Z	tanki	Bubbling_Zombie	there's a sex-game in there, u know when he meets his girlfriend
