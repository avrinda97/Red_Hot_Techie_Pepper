2010-10-21T05:51:00.000Z	Agent001		Do people generally keep icons/folders on ubuntu desktop?
2010-10-21T05:51:00.000Z	Agent001		Its just that the icons are so big...
2010-10-21T05:51:00.000Z	coz_	Agent001	  I do not... unless I want to transfer them to external storage... but yes it is very personal
2010-10-21T05:52:00.000Z	coz_	Agent001	 can you screenshot that and upload to picpaste.com  so I can see it?  yes?
2010-10-21T05:53:00.000Z	coz_	Agent001	 what size monitor set at which resolution?
2010-10-21T05:54:00.000Z	coz_	Agent001	  and you feel the icons are too large on that
2010-10-21T05:55:00.000Z	coz_	Agent001	 ok open  nautilus
2010-10-21T05:56:00.000Z	coz_	Agent001	 under the "View"  tab  there is a section named "Icon View Defaults"  and that is probably set at 100%   you can change that there     ....nautilus would open when you open your home directory
2010-10-21T05:58:00.000Z	coz_	Agent001	  find it?
2010-10-21T05:59:00.000Z	coz_	Agent001	  ok   do you see the "View"  tab under  Edit  /  preferences
2010-10-21T05:59:00.000Z	coz_	Agent001	  go to the "Edit"  menu and open Preferences
2010-10-21T05:59:00.000Z	coz_	Agent001	  when that dialog opens  the first tab  ...in maverick>> is the "View" tab
2010-10-21T06:00:00.000Z	coz_	Agent001	  ok cool
2010-10-21T06:00:00.000Z	coz_	Agent001	 no problem
2010-10-21T06:03:00.000Z	coz_	Agent001	  :)   yes .. but now you see can configure the look and feel to suit your needs :)
2010-10-21T06:03:00.000Z	coz_	Agent001	  most of the icons are  svg format meaning you can make them wall size and they will still be sharp
2010-10-21T06:04:00.000Z	coz_	Agent001	  :)
2010-10-21T06:05:00.000Z	coz_	Agent001	 if after making these changes the icons in your home directory are not original size  ...hold down the ctrl  key and use the scroll wheel to reset them
