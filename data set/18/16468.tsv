2005-03-11T07:11:00.000Z	bob2	b	please don't spread FUD like that
2005-03-11T07:11:00.000Z	bob2	b	whatever article you're talking about is wrong
2005-03-11T07:11:00.000Z	bob2	b	please contact the author and correct them
2005-03-11T07:14:00.000Z	bob2	b	sorry, you seem to be mis-interpreting the article
2005-03-11T07:15:00.000Z	bob2	b	kde is not installed by default, but it's certainly available
2005-03-11T07:15:00.000Z	bob2	b	also, I'm not sure where you got the "gnome is built into the kernel" idea from
2005-03-11T08:34:00.000Z	bob2	b	how would that help?
2005-03-11T08:34:00.000Z	bob2	b	yes
2005-03-11T08:35:00.000Z	bob2	b	that's a subjective statement
2005-03-11T08:37:00.000Z	bob2	b	ok
2005-03-11T08:40:00.000Z	bob2	b	synaptic is fine, and installed by default and doesn't pull in megs of KDE libraries.
2005-03-11T11:55:00.000Z	bob2	b	yes, way too technical
2005-03-11T11:57:00.000Z	bob2	b	man apt-get, --allow-unauthenticated
