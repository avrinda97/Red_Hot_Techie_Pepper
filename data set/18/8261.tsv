2007-09-15T11:48:00.000Z	cjracker		from a dmg?
2007-09-15T11:49:00.000Z	cjracker		hosting co i work for is considering charging extra from joomla cause its so much trouble.. exploits out the wazoo

2007-09-15T11:50:00.000Z	cjracker		ls -lah /var/www/
2007-09-15T11:52:00.000Z	cjracker		sure, Creed
2007-09-15T11:52:00.000Z	cjracker		add them to /etc/init.d/
2007-09-15T11:52:00.000Z	Creed	cjracker	got an example? Theres scripts in that folder but I dont really know how to write one of my own
2007-09-15T11:54:00.000Z	Creed	cjracker	a few things actually. First Openfire (/home/ron/openfire/bin/openfire start) then pyaimt and pymsnt (in screen sessions)
2007-09-15T11:54:00.000Z	Creed	cjracker	wouldnt that break the program?
2007-09-15T12:45:00.000Z	Creed	cjracker	glad youre still here ;) I got openfire to work but I cant get pyaimt to work, if I start it like openfire it stops things after it from booting....I cant figure out how to get it to start inside a screen, any chance you know how?
2007-09-15T12:45:00.000Z	Creed	cjracker	dont worry about openfire it works as its suposed to. I just want to start pyaimt which runs in the foreground (doesnt have a switch to make it run in the background). How would i start pyaimt?
2007-09-15T12:49:00.000Z	cjracker	Creed	so we want it to output to stdout?
2007-09-15T12:50:00.000Z	Creed	cjracker	stdout or null as I dont really need to ever look at what its doing.
2007-09-15T13:12:00.000Z	cjracker	Creed	you would want a start and stop argument to it
2007-09-15T13:14:00.000Z	Creed	cjracker	/ nickrud , http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/37492/ is my script atm, what would go inthe stop portion?
2007-09-15T13:16:00.000Z	Creed	cjracker	only openfire stops with my script, I havnt added the portion to stop pyaimt, any idea how I would do that as pyaimt.py simply runs as python
2007-09-15T13:18:00.000Z	Creed	cjracker	that would work but pyaimt is a python script, it runs under the name python.
