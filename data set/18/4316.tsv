2009-06-10T18:07:00.000Z	harahauk		anyone else getting segfault from mount.cifs?
2009-06-10T18:08:00.000Z	harahauk		can anyone running jaunty try running "mount.cifs" in their terminal with no other arguments? segfault?
2009-06-10T18:10:00.000Z	eurythmia	harahauk	I can confirm that.
2009-06-10T18:11:00.000Z	harahauk	eurythmia	ok thanks:) i guess I'll stay away from cifs till its fixed
2009-06-10T18:12:00.000Z	eurythmia	harahauk	it may just be an issue with the way the arguments are handled (if it's looking for an argument that's not there, and the arguments aren't handled properly, then when the array is indexed, it will segfault)
2009-06-10T18:12:00.000Z	eurythmia	harahauk	is there some other behaviour that you're experiencing that you hoped could be explained by that?
2009-06-10T18:12:00.000Z	harahauk	eurythmia	true, but it also segfaults on a share i had, forced me to reboot a server to resolve the issue
2009-06-10T18:13:00.000Z	eurythmia	harahauk	ah. that may be a different issue.
2009-06-10T18:13:00.000Z	eurythmia	harahauk	hold on a moment.
2009-06-10T18:13:00.000Z	harahauk	eurythmia	yeah, if cifs crashes i cant "sudo umount -f sharename", only option afaik is reboot
2009-06-10T18:13:00.000Z	harahauk		ok :)
2009-06-10T18:17:00.000Z	eurythmia	harahauk	try running the following: strace -o mount.cifs_strace.log -f -i -e verbose=all -s 256 -tt <your mount command>
2009-06-10T18:19:00.000Z	eurythmia	harahauk	that will trace the run (with LOTS of output to a logfile) and it will try mounting the share. From there, we may be able to tell what's causing the segfault.
2009-06-10T18:21:00.000Z	eurythmia	harahauk	it seems like the no args segfault is a known bug: Bug#529980: /sbin/mount.cifs: Segmentation fault while running "mount.cifs"
2009-06-10T18:21:00.000Z	harahauk	eurythmia	thanks, i will try it later and try to analyze the output. if i'm clueless I'll ask for help again :) but right now im gonna install fuse to be sure the process can be killed, might sacreifice some speed over cifs, but i wont have to reboot ;)
2009-06-10T18:22:00.000Z	eurythmia	harahauk	:) ... I'll /msg you my contact info in case you need any more help later.
2009-06-10T18:22:00.000Z	harahauk	eurythmia	awesome =) thanks again
2009-06-10T18:23:00.000Z	eurythmia	harahauk	no problem. I hope I can help you figure it out :)
