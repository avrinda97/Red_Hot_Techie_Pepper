2008-03-10T05:32:00.000Z	LjL	Taso	no
2008-03-10T05:32:00.000Z	LjL	Taso	pastebin your current /etc/apt/sources.list
2008-03-10T05:33:00.000Z	LjL	Taso	yes
2008-03-10T05:33:00.000Z	LjL	Taso	Sid is in constant evolution
2008-03-10T05:33:00.000Z	LjL	Taso	Sid has nothing to do with Ubuntu, however
2008-03-10T05:34:00.000Z	LjL	Taso	and who told you that the word "stable" meant anything in the sources.list?
2008-03-10T05:35:00.000Z	LjL	Taso	i asked you to pastebin your current sources.list. if you don't want to, i can't help you.
2008-03-10T05:38:00.000Z	LjL	Taso	there is no guarantee that a Hardy package won't break your system if you try to install it on Gutsy, unless it's a backport.
