2010-02-17T09:13:00.000Z	dgd	darolu	Doesn't Docky do that?
2010-02-17T09:13:00.000Z	darolu	dgd	thanks. nyqvist, most of us use Avant Window Manager (awn) but there are several docks, cairo dock is good too
2010-02-17T09:14:00.000Z	darolu	dgd	I didn't know Docky existed, I use AWN, I used Cairo Dock once too, both are good; I'll try Docky thanks for the tip
2010-02-17T09:14:00.000Z	darolu	dgd	ctrl+alt+right arrow
2010-02-17T09:18:00.000Z	dgd	darolu	thanks! That works...
2010-02-17T09:19:00.000Z	dgd	darolu	Now, why does my second "scroll button" swing me from workspace to workspace on occasion?
2010-02-17T09:19:00.000Z	darolu	dgd	it is a compiz option, if you want to get rid of it install ccsm
2010-02-17T09:19:00.000Z	dgd	darolu	ccsm?
2010-02-17T09:19:00.000Z	dgd	darolu	what about metacity?
2010-02-17T09:20:00.000Z	dgd	darolu	what about compatability?
2010-02-17T09:20:00.000Z	darolu	dgd	sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager
2010-02-17T09:21:00.000Z	darolu	dgd	don't worry, works perfectly fine with metacity, ccsm is a GUI to configure compiz, it comes with other plug ins; there you'll find workspace switcher and within the option to disable the mouse wheel option
2010-02-17T09:22:00.000Z	dgd	darolu	excellent: the "mouse wheel" is actually a feature of my trackpad - and I hate having compiz swipe it that way...
2010-02-17T09:22:00.000Z	dgd	darolu	I think was looking for that "CCSM" before...
2010-02-17T09:25:00.000Z	dgd	darolu	thanks! I think I found it!
2010-02-17T09:26:00.000Z	dgd	darolu	no more flipping workspaces by accident...
2010-02-17T09:26:00.000Z	darolu	dgd	I'm glad you solved it, ccsm is really neat, try all the plug ins, some of theme are extremely useful
