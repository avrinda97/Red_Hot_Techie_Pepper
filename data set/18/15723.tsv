2005-02-06T07:56:00.000Z	rob__		Is it fixed in hoary tritium, cause if it was he could try updating to fix it.....
2005-02-06T07:57:00.000Z	tritium	rob__	I don't think so.  That bug says "Hoary will hang..."
2005-02-06T07:57:00.000Z	tritium	rob__	actually, it says the status is resolved, so it might be fixed
2005-02-08T12:38:00.000Z	tritium	rob__	no
2005-02-08T12:46:00.000Z	tritium	rob__	I noticed that graveman uses cdrecord.  Maybe the problem is that cdrecord can't find your burner?
2005-02-08T12:46:00.000Z	rob__	tritium	its possible
2005-02-08T12:48:00.000Z	rob__	tritium	actually I can be faily shure that it does detect my cdroms because It is telling me the correct names of them and letting me chose which ones to use
2005-02-08T12:48:00.000Z	tritium	rob__	okay
2005-02-08T12:50:00.000Z	rob__	tritium	AHH-HA!  it did need to be started as sudo to work!
2005-02-08T12:54:00.000Z	tritium	rob__	strange.  I didn't need that.  Is your user not in the "cdrom" group?
2005-02-08T12:54:00.000Z	rob__	tritium	my user is the default user, if Im not in the cdrom group its a bug
2005-02-08T12:55:00.000Z	tritium	rob__	odd
2008-09-30T08:49:00.000Z	tritium	rob__	not to a binary package.  You'd have to fetch the source package, and apply the patch to source, then rebuild it.
2008-09-30T08:49:00.000Z	rob__	tritium	could you link me to a how-to on how to do that?
2008-09-30T08:51:00.000Z	tritium	rob__	nothing specific.  If you know that patch you want to apply, give it a try.
2008-09-30T08:52:00.000Z	rob__	tritium	well I don't even know how to apply a patch so... could you help me out there?
2008-09-30T08:54:00.000Z	tritium	rob__	sorry, not right now
2008-09-30T08:55:00.000Z	rob__	tritium	its alright, im just going to make a thread. thanks for helping this much
