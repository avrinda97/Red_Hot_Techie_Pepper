2009-10-31T22:44:00.000Z	Gyndawyr		I was wondering if somebody could help me answer a hardware related question?
2009-10-31T22:44:00.000Z	k1ko	Gyndawyr	go on :)
2009-10-31T22:45:00.000Z	Gyndawyr		I could buy the Samsung SM2343NW (here: http://www.ebuyer.com/product/158908) for £150
2009-10-31T22:45:00.000Z	Gyndawyr		or I could buy the Dell SP2309W (here: http://www.overclockers.co.uk/showproduct.php?prodid=MO-031-DE) for £50 more
2009-10-31T22:46:00.000Z	Gyndawyr		which one should I buy essentially?
2009-10-31T22:46:00.000Z	Gyndawyr		but is it £50 better?
2009-10-31T22:47:00.000Z	k1ko	Gyndawyr	i like the samsung more :)
2009-10-31T22:47:00.000Z	k1ko	Gyndawyr	the samsung has more contarst
2009-10-31T22:47:00.000Z	Gyndawyr		both have provided similar specification but neither really informed me of their manufacturing process
2009-10-31T22:47:00.000Z	Gyndawyr		most of the technology used in the televisions are of similar ability and technology, and so going by these minor dfferences isnt really useful
2009-10-31T22:48:00.000Z	Gyndawyr		the manufacturing process is more important, but I cannot find any information on it
2009-10-31T22:48:00.000Z	k1ko		whoooops my bad :D
2009-10-31T22:48:00.000Z	k1ko		sorry
2009-10-31T22:49:00.000Z	Gyndawyr		dynamic contrast ratio means pretty much nothing. static contrast ratio tells you a bit, but generally its a waste of time anyway. they are tested under "ideal conditions"
2009-10-31T22:50:00.000Z	k1ko	Gyndawyr	dell has DVI & HDMI
2009-10-31T22:50:00.000Z	Gyndawyr	k1ko	does that mean anything?
2009-10-31T22:50:00.000Z	Gyndawyr		Samsung has VGA.
2009-10-31T22:50:00.000Z	k1ko	Gyndawyr	yeah... but DVI is better than VGA
