2008-10-06T12:25:00.000Z	greenthumb		how come i cant extract rar files on my windows drive from ubuntu.? is that impossible?
2008-10-06T12:25:00.000Z	koshari	greenthumb	if you can mount the partition theres no reason you shouldnt be able to access any non encrypted fiels
2008-10-06T12:26:00.000Z	greenthumb	koshari	i cant mount it. so that's weird. I got all these rar archives all together containg a dvd movie. you know like .r00, .r01 and so on
2008-10-06T12:28:00.000Z	koshari	greenthumb	yeah so whats the problem?
2008-10-06T12:28:00.000Z	greenthumb	koshari	it says something about the archive aint supported. but it's normal rar files
2008-10-06T12:29:00.000Z	koshari	greenthumb	you need to install the rar codec, "sudo apt-get install rar"
2008-10-06T12:31:00.000Z	greenthumb	koshari	 i can see the files, i can play avi and mp3 files from there, but i cant extract my dvd movie
2008-10-06T12:31:00.000Z	koshari	greenthumb	you need to install the rar codec, "sudo apt-get install rar"
2008-10-06T12:32:00.000Z	koshari	greenthumb	so open a terminal, paste the line i posted (without quotes) into a terminal and your away
2008-10-06T12:33:00.000Z	greenthumb	koshari	 when i try to install it says E: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/) is another process using it?
2008-10-06T12:33:00.000Z	koshari	greenthumb	close the synaptic  or update app you have open
2008-10-06T12:35:00.000Z	koshari	greenthumb	and you can install a package :-)
2008-10-06T12:37:00.000Z	koshari	greenthumb	get a console
2008-10-06T12:38:00.000Z	greenthumb	koshari	hehe.. well i just spend lots of money on this pc for gaming
2008-10-06T12:58:00.000Z	greenthumb	koshari	do you know how i dowload directly from limewire to my windows partition?
2008-10-06T12:59:00.000Z	koshari	greenthumb	you should use frostwire instead of limewire
2008-10-06T12:59:00.000Z	koshari	greenthumb	and the destination directory will be in the settings
2008-10-06T12:59:00.000Z	greenthumb	koshari	 settings in limewire?
