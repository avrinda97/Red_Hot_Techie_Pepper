2007-08-02T15:42:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	jono	so canonical is a pretty cool company? maybe i should apply for a job there :)
2007-08-02T15:43:00.000Z	jono	howlingmadhowie	very cool, demands a lot though
2007-08-02T15:45:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	jono	mm (cue graphic of homer simpson weighing up cool against demanding)
2007-08-02T16:23:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	jono	now to send my cv to canonical :) (maniacal laughter)
