2009-09-17T21:38:00.000Z	OriWB		how do i find out if my computer is 32btor 64bit?
2009-09-17T21:39:00.000Z	stew	OriWB	grep "flags.*lm" /proc/cpuinfo
2009-09-17T21:39:00.000Z	OriWB	stew	sorry, i dont understand
2009-09-17T21:39:00.000Z	stew	OriWB	run this command, "grep "flags.*\blm\b" /proc/cpuinfo" if it spits anything out, you have 64 bit. if it doesn't output anything you have 32 bit
2009-09-17T21:40:00.000Z	OriWB		stew:so no file direcotry means 32 bit?
2009-09-17T21:40:00.000Z	stew	OriWB	no, that means something different
2009-09-17T21:41:00.000Z	stew	OriWB	if you "ls /proc" do you get lots of results? or nothing? or what?
2009-09-17T21:41:00.000Z	OriWB	stew	got a whole bunch of stuff
2009-09-17T21:41:00.000Z	stew	OriWB	are you running linux?
2009-09-17T21:41:00.000Z	OriWB	stew	of course
2009-09-17T21:41:00.000Z	OriWB	stew	its all in blue
2009-09-17T21:42:00.000Z	stew	OriWB	can you show me the exact command you ran that gave you "No such file.."?
2009-09-17T21:42:00.000Z	OriWB	stew	i might'veaccidently put in the quotes. just  sec'
2009-09-17T21:42:00.000Z	OriWB	stew	this time i got stuff
2009-09-17T21:43:00.000Z	OriWB	stew	so that means 64?
2009-09-17T21:43:00.000Z	stew	OriWB	you need the quotes around "flags.*\blm\b", but not around the whole thing
2009-09-17T21:43:00.000Z	stew	OriWB	yes, if you have the "lm" flag, that is "long mode" which is 64 bit
2009-09-17T21:43:00.000Z	OriWB	stew	great thanx alot
