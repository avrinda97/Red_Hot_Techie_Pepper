2011-10-11T07:58:00.000Z	zykotick9	ryannathans	using kill -9 against package manager isn't the greatest suggestion (but MIGHT be required).  arooni-mobile
2011-10-11T07:58:00.000Z	ryannathans	zykotick9	i'm aware
2011-10-11T08:25:00.000Z	ryannathans	zykotick9	since ehwn
2011-10-11T08:25:00.000Z	zykotick9	ryannathans	quite a while
2011-10-11T08:26:00.000Z	ryannathans	zykotick9	works perfectly on my 11.04 server
2011-10-11T08:28:00.000Z	zykotick9	ryannathans	the #debian factoid for webmin begins "Webmin is a lame web-based interface for unsafe system administration for Unix..."
2011-10-11T10:21:00.000Z	zykotick9	ryannathans	if the drive is 2TB you can't use standard MBR to partitions.  Sorry I don't have a 2TB drive yet, so don't personally know the solution.
2011-10-11T10:21:00.000Z	ryannathans	zykotick9	it's just under 2tb though and works fine with standard MBR in windows
