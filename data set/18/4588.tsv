2009-03-21T15:33:00.000Z	peachy		this is .. frustrating, why couldn't .deb contain a cpio or tar.bz2 directly, wtf is with this "ar" format :-/
2009-03-21T15:33:00.000Z	peachy		and pos to install
2009-03-21T15:35:00.000Z	peachy		great, where does it live? googling for unar on 8kb/sec mobile inet sucks big time
2009-03-21T15:36:00.000Z	maxb	peachy	the program is just called "ar"
2009-03-21T15:37:00.000Z	peachy		language?
2009-03-21T15:37:00.000Z	maxb	peachy	Why are you trying to manually extract a .deb?
2009-03-21T15:37:00.000Z	maxb	peachy	dpkg-deb -x foo.deb destinationdir
2009-03-21T15:38:00.000Z	peachy	maxb	need the swiss wordlist from the intrepid repo, not on ubuntu right now, limited inet connectivity & doing an audit
2009-03-21T15:38:00.000Z	peachy		ortsvorsteher:: clarify
2009-03-21T15:38:00.000Z	maxb	peachy	ok, dpkg-deb -x is what you want to use to just extract a .deb to peek inside its files
2009-03-21T15:39:00.000Z	maxb	peachy	oh.... or does "not on ubuntu" mean "not on any dpkg-based distro at all" ?
2009-03-21T15:39:00.000Z	peachy		maxb:: yup, sadly, seeing if I can install dpkg easier than finding "ar" atm
2009-03-21T15:40:00.000Z	maxb	peachy	any linux system should include ar. It's a fairly ancient part of the unix tradition :-)
2009-03-21T15:41:00.000Z	peachy	maxb	haha, tell that to Sun :)
2009-03-21T15:42:00.000Z	maxb	peachy	Oh. Sun? You're on Solaris?
2009-03-21T15:42:00.000Z	maxb	peachy	ar is part of binutils on Linux, if that helps you find it
2009-03-21T15:42:00.000Z	peachy		nah sun linux 5.0.3
2009-03-21T15:42:00.000Z	peachy	maxb	thanks
