2008-10-10T09:28:00.000Z	not_myself		Anyone in here ever installed ubuntu to a usb thumb drive?
2008-10-10T09:28:00.000Z	not_myself		Does it boot faster than a hard drive?
2008-10-10T09:29:00.000Z	SeaPhor	not_myself	i have
2008-10-10T09:29:00.000Z	not_myself	SeaPhor	does it boot faster?
2008-10-10T09:29:00.000Z	SeaPhor	not_myself	and no faster, but it was also less dependable
2008-10-10T09:29:00.000Z	not_myself		bummer
2008-10-10T09:31:00.000Z	SeaPhor	not_myself	like the 3rd day it started losing info, and that was once i started updating, now mine was with a 4gb and i will try again with a 16gb drive,, that may prove better
2008-10-10T09:33:00.000Z	not_myself		So it looks like if I wanted a fast boot, I'd need to get a solid state drive, and use that.
2008-10-10T09:35:00.000Z	SeaPhor	not_myself	i havent seen much improvement in speed with those, just more firmware/driver issues, but they are nice, just very expensive for the lack od dependability
2008-10-10T09:35:00.000Z	SeaPhor		*of
2008-10-10T09:35:00.000Z	not_myself		Ok.
2008-10-10T09:36:00.000Z	not_myself		I can drive 4 blocks before the login screen shows up, and I was wondering if there was an easy way to go about getting a fast boot.  So I'm guessing 1-2 minutes
2008-10-10T09:38:00.000Z	SeaPhor	not_myself	there's something else wrong then, i boot in 20-25 seconds on a bad day
2008-10-10T09:38:00.000Z	not_myself		I guess I could time it.
2008-10-10T09:38:00.000Z	not_myself		It's a lap top.
2008-10-10T09:38:00.000Z	not_myself		Well it's bed time
2008-10-10T09:39:00.000Z	not_myself		thanks for the info SeaPhor
