2012-08-16T00:49:00.000Z	Bryan-VM		hmm
2012-08-16T00:49:00.000Z	Bryan-VM		Does Firefox have a memory leak?
2012-08-16T00:49:00.000Z	Bryan-VM		Because just sitting there with no open tabs got me 86% of my CPU taken up.
2012-08-16T00:51:00.000Z	Bryan-VM		hmm
2012-08-16T00:51:00.000Z	Bryan-VM		I dont know what else to do/try
2012-08-16T00:51:00.000Z	Bryan-VM		No, im using Midori
2012-08-16T00:51:00.000Z	TJ-	Bryan-VM	Is that Firefox running inside a virtual machine guest? or on the bare metal host?
2012-08-16T00:52:00.000Z	TJ-	Bryan-VM	what hypervisor are you using? what is the host OS?
2012-08-16T00:53:00.000Z	TJ-	Bryan-VM	which release of Ubuntu, and 32 or 64 bit guest?
2012-08-16T00:55:00.000Z	TJ-	Bryan-VM	I'm seeing some indications that this is some kind of vmware issue, let me dig deeper
2012-08-16T00:58:00.000Z	TJ-	Bryan-VM	I'm reading that on some bare-metal hosts where the CPU's hardware virtualisation hasn't been enabled (usually via BIOS setting) this can occur since the virtualisation has to be done completely in software
2012-08-16T00:58:00.000Z	TJ-	Bryan-VM	What CPU does the host have? is VT enabled?
2012-08-16T01:01:00.000Z	TJ-	Bryan-VM	to be clear, is the Ubuntu guest itself reporting that the firefox process is using 86% ?
2012-08-16T01:10:00.000Z	TJ-	Bryan-VM	I think I'm confused too :D   ... From what you said earlier about CPU usage 86% I understood that to mean than the ubuntu guest was showing the firefox process using 86% in the guest. Is that correct?
2012-08-16T01:11:00.000Z	TJ-	Bryan-VM	OK ... if you stop the firefox process CPU usage returns to idle?
2012-08-16T01:11:00.000Z	TJ-	Bryan-VM	OK ... is it a vanilla firefox installation ... no plugins/extensions added?
2012-08-16T01:12:00.000Z	TJ-	Bryan-VM	OK... and this occurs with the only tab open being the overview/most visited sites thumbnails?
2012-08-16T01:19:00.000Z	TJ-	Bryan-VM	I'm still searching for indicators... whatever causes it, it's rare
