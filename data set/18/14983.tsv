2005-10-21T16:51:00.000Z	penguin42	nalioth	I'll admit to as an experienced debian/ubuntu user having had to fight for a few hours with a dist-upgrade and will probably do a clean next time (at least of /)
2005-10-21T16:52:00.000Z	penguin42	nalioth	I hit a lot of conflicts during the dist-upgrade, I in the end had to remove some packages with dpkg -r  before I could get it to complete
2005-10-21T16:53:00.000Z	nalioth	penguin42	if you do a lot of your own compiling, a dist-upgrade can be fun (it was for me, at least....not)
2005-10-21T16:54:00.000Z	penguin42	nalioth	I haven't got any packages I've built from source on here I don't think; I have got various bits of universe in however
2005-10-21T16:55:00.000Z	nalioth	penguin42	that shouldn't stop a successful dist-upgrade, my G3 ibook hardly resembled ubuntu when i dist-upgraded and it was not fun
2005-10-21T16:56:00.000Z	penguin42	nalioth	Well I remember I got a class between two openoffice packages in the dist-upgrade (openoffice.org2-help-en-us and openoffice.org2-calc) and there were some others that I had to also fix - it was a real fight
2005-10-21T16:57:00.000Z	nalioth	penguin42	yes, the OO2 was a packager foobar
2005-10-21T16:58:00.000Z	penguin42	nalioth	Ah it happens; I think one nasty was that I started the dist-upgrade before midnight and when I got to it the next morning it was complaining some package files were missing - I think the cron.daily apt clean up happened
2005-10-21T16:59:00.000Z	nalioth	penguin42	and if you did it within the last couple of days, the servers have been hammered
2005-10-21T16:59:00.000Z	penguin42	nalioth	Hey yeh I did it last night - but my suspicion is that the apt-cache clean up needs tuning to leave stuff around for longer in that case
2005-10-21T05:00:00.000Z	nalioth	penguin42	once a week perhaps?
2005-10-21T05:00:00.000Z	penguin42	nalioth	Well its got a setting for how long files have been there, so run daily but set it not to delete anything recent - or perhaps there is a bug in its determination of that?
2005-10-21T05:00:00.000Z	nalioth	penguin42	you can do that
2005-10-21T05:01:00.000Z	penguin42	nalioth	My gut feel says that the default needs changing to leave it for 2 or 3 days, or for the dist-upgrade instructions to say to disable it - those of on 512k DSL lines need a good 3 or 4 hour download
2005-10-21T05:06:00.000Z	nalioth	penguin42	your whole system will use them , if the program is aware of codecs
2005-10-21T05:06:00.000Z	penguin42	nalioth	Well gmplayer is playing them, but I could swear totem used to at one point
2005-10-21T05:22:00.000Z	penguin42	nalioth	Yeh but NFS is such a PITA
2005-10-21T05:24:00.000Z	penguin42	nalioth	The world has windows boxes - we have to live with that fact for the moment
