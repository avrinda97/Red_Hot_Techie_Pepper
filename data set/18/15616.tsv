2007-08-01T14:43:00.000Z	CheeseGarener		I heard beginning is best
2007-08-01T14:43:00.000Z	CheeseGarener		but I'm not 100% sure
2007-08-01T14:44:00.000Z	CheeseGarener		ok one sec
2007-08-01T14:44:00.000Z	CheeseGarener		thank you for helping enselic
2007-08-01T14:45:00.000Z	CheeseGarener		what about a /home mount?
2007-08-01T14:45:00.000Z	CheeseGarener		I heard I need a /home drive
2007-08-01T14:45:00.000Z	CheeseGarener		They say it is good to have
2007-08-01T14:45:00.000Z	CheeseGarener		to manage files
2007-08-01T14:46:00.000Z	CheeseGarener		what is the point?  to make a file area?
2007-08-01T14:46:00.000Z	CheeseGarener		/home would be for files?
2007-08-01T14:46:00.000Z	jimcooncat	CheeseGarener	/home drives are nice if you do clean installs instead of regular dist-upgrades
2007-08-01T14:47:00.000Z	jimcooncat	CheeseGarener	/home on an LVM partition can be snapshotted before backup so your backups are consistent -- good for multiple users
2007-08-01T14:48:00.000Z	jimcooncat	CheeseGarener	if you're a single user, don't worry about such things
2007-08-01T14:49:00.000Z	jimcooncat	CheeseGarener	you'd have to tell it during install, or modify your /etc/fstab if your changing a current install
2007-08-01T14:51:00.000Z	jimcooncat	CheeseGarener	I'd go with 4 gig / and 14 gig /home, lol
2007-08-01T14:51:00.000Z	jimcooncat	CheeseGarener	through the installer, yes
2007-08-01T14:52:00.000Z	jimcooncat	CheeseGarener	it's not enough to just give it a label "home", but also to specify to mount it under /home
2007-08-01T14:55:00.000Z	jimcooncat	CheeseGarener	just tell it you want to specify the partitions -- say no if it asks you for format the whole drive as one
