2009-05-06T16:32:00.000Z	elky	ActionParsnip	please stop telling people to compile stuff without taking experience level or other risks into consideration.
2009-05-06T16:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	elky	very little risk in compiling, a configure can fail....
2009-05-06T16:34:00.000Z	elky	ActionParsnip	there's plenty of risk of traumatising the user and confusing them unnecessarily.
2009-05-06T16:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	elky	well i did ask and s/he wanted to compile and was aware of the repo version, what else can i do
2009-05-06T16:39:00.000Z	elky	ActionParsnip	i'd much prefer you warn them against it, not talk them into it. if they insist off their own bat, give them a full and proper explanation and advice rather than blase 'get -dev files'
2009-05-06T16:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	elky	s/he wanted to leave before i got chance. i was pretty much gonna handhold the whole way through, but you knew that didnt you
2009-05-06T16:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	elky	ive been coming in here long enough to know that many users arent expert but many want to try something other than just use the repos and debs, and i'm happy to assist in that.
2009-05-06T16:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	elky	makes people feel more comfortable with there system if they do someting more than just use synaptic and click around
2009-05-06T16:45:00.000Z	elky	ActionParsnip	rarely. very rarely.
2009-05-06T16:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	elky	ive found it personally after helping tonnes of folks
2009-05-06T16:47:00.000Z	elky	ActionParsnip	and i've been in these channels longer than you and i can tell you for fact that it only confuses them. you might talk them into thinking it's better, but you create bad habits that cause much grief down the track.
2009-05-06T16:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	elky	if they are aware of the repos and want to compile, i will help  them
2012-03-27T05:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	elky	haha like your style
2012-03-27T05:46:00.000Z	elky	ActionParsnip	left of its own accord.
2012-03-27T05:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	elky	no bad thing, thanks anyway
2012-03-27T05:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	elky	I think dr_willis left the cage open agin
2012-09-04T08:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	elky	useuname -a outputs: 2.3.9-29-generic
