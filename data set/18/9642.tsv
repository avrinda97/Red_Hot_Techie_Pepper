2007-03-22T10:26:00.000Z	fbarcenas		I found a bug, but I'm not even sure how to go about reporting it. If you use the basic ubuntu install with evolution and bogofilter all works fine. But as soon as you do all the update from 6.10 forward bogofilter begins to terminate unexpectedly. I forced me to download, compile and install an update version of bogofilter to fix the problem. Who should I report the issue to, UBUNTU or BOGOFILTER?
2007-03-22T10:27:00.000Z	soundray	fbarcenas	on launchpad.net, against package bogofilter

2007-04-30T12:03:00.000Z	fbarcenas	soundray	How's it goin?
2007-04-30T12:03:00.000Z	soundray	fbarcenas	all right, apart from the fact that you're so blatantly contradicting me about the test ^^
2007-05-30T10:46:00.000Z	soundray	fbarcenas	I can't
2007-05-30T10:46:00.000Z	fbarcenas	soundray	why not?
2007-05-30T10:47:00.000Z	soundray	fbarcenas	because I'm not in the US
2007-05-30T10:47:00.000Z	fbarcenas	soundray	neither am I, and I can get it here in Mexico with ubuntu.
2007-05-30T10:48:00.000Z	soundray	fbarcenas	well, I can't get it here, but never mind, it's not support related, so off topic.
2007-05-30T10:48:00.000Z	fbarcenas	soundray	 how do I get my DESKTOP EFFECTS working? It says composite extension not installed.
2007-05-30T10:49:00.000Z	soundray	fbarcenas	I waste enough time chatting on IRC. I'm not going to make it worse by trying wobbly windows ;)
2007-05-30T10:49:00.000Z	fbarcenas	soundray	composite extension is not AVAILABLE.
2007-05-30T10:50:00.000Z	fbarcenas	soundray	ahh.. a purist.
2007-05-30T10:50:00.000Z	soundray	fbarcenas	no, I use graphical interfaces and like coffee with milk
