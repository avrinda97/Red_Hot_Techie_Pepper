2007-04-19T11:58:00.000Z	keith		lol
2007-04-19T11:58:00.000Z	keith		I win
2007-04-19T11:58:00.000Z	keith		can I ask someone a question relating to wine and Warcraft III? Preferably someone who's had success with it.
2007-04-19T11:59:00.000Z	keith		I am running Warcraft III in wine, and it works, but it's very jumpy...
2007-04-19T12:00:00.000Z	keith		it works reasonably well in windows. I'm wondering if it's wine, or just that my graphics card sucks in addition to poor driver support by ati?
2007-04-19T12:00:00.000Z	SeveredCross	keith	Do you have hardware acceleration working?
2007-04-19T12:00:00.000Z	SeveredCross		(glxinfo | grep -i direct--if you see yes, then you do.)
2007-04-19T12:00:00.000Z	keith		SeveredCross... I'm honestly not sure. I installed the restricted ATI drivers, but I'm not sure how to check
2007-04-19T12:01:00.000Z	SeveredCross		Keith: Open a terminal, type in
2007-04-19T12:01:00.000Z	SeveredCross		glxinfo | grep -i direct
2007-04-19T12:01:00.000Z	keith		direct rendering: Yes
2007-04-19T12:01:00.000Z	SeveredCross		Okay, then it's Wine.
2007-04-19T12:02:00.000Z	SeveredCross		You may want to give Cedega a stab, but it's not free.
2007-04-19T12:02:00.000Z	keith		Baudtheif, did you get it to work with beryl?
2007-04-19T12:03:00.000Z	keith		for beryl?
2007-04-19T12:03:00.000Z	SeveredCross		Uh, they should?
2007-04-19T12:03:00.000Z	keith	SeveredCross	the card is very cheap. I bought it to make do until I decided to get a nice one... someone said WarIII worked fine fore them... so I'm wondering if the drivers just aren't support well enough for my cheap card...
