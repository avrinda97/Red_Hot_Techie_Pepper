2005-10-18T11:27:00.000Z	zyph		oh i see, no wonder i couldn't upgrade
2005-10-18T11:27:00.000Z	zyph		everyone's eating bandwidth
2005-10-18T11:27:00.000Z	zyph		i do have a question though, i'm running breezy badger test
2005-10-18T11:28:00.000Z	zyph		do i need to change my repositories?
2005-10-18T11:28:00.000Z	dradul	zyph	if you updated your install yesterday from the net, you already have the officual, stable release.
2005-10-18T11:28:00.000Z	zyph		thanks nalioth
2005-10-18T11:28:00.000Z	zyph		i didn't
2005-10-18T11:29:00.000Z	zyph		i think i got breezy when it came out
2005-10-18T11:29:00.000Z	zyph		i like ubuntu, but i think there's a lot of stuff missing from repositories
2005-10-18T11:30:00.000Z	zyph		yeah
2005-10-18T11:30:00.000Z	zyph		for instance, there are some games that are in debian repositories or have gentoo ebuilds, but aren't in ubuntu universe
2005-10-18T11:30:00.000Z	dradul	zyph	if you already have a breezy colony CD explore the uses of jigit. That's how I updated my ISO to the release version this morning, I only had to download les than 100 Mb, everything else was already in the apt cache.
2005-10-18T11:31:00.000Z	zyph		colony CD?
2005-10-18T11:31:00.000Z	zyph	nalioth	no
2005-10-18T11:31:00.000Z	dradul	zyph	yes, something like the release candidate Cd or alike.
2005-10-18T11:31:00.000Z	zyph		ah, dradul
2005-10-18T11:33:00.000Z	zyph		i can only use ubuntu deb packages right? not general debian packages?
2005-10-18T11:34:00.000Z	dradul	zyph	that's correct.
