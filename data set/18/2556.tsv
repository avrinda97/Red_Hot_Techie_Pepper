2010-04-22T10:25:00.000Z	crucialhoax		I am using 3.6.3 in Lucid and Flash works perfect.
2010-04-22T10:27:00.000Z	crucialhoax		It installs Ubuntu basically as a program inside windows. It does not touch the hard drive or the partitions.
2010-04-22T10:28:00.000Z	got_a_question	crucialhoax	i dont to install ubuntu as a program
2010-04-22T10:28:00.000Z	crucialhoax	got_a_question	It is the easiest way if you are just starting off.
2010-04-22T10:31:00.000Z	got_a_question	crucialhoax	i have already installed ubuntu as a program
2010-04-22T10:31:00.000Z	crucialhoax	got_a_question	You are already using Wubi?
2010-04-22T10:33:00.000Z	got_a_question	crucialhoax	i will uninstall wubi/ubuntu then reinstall XP and then install ubuntu as primary
2010-04-22T10:35:00.000Z	crucialhoax	got_a_question	Ok, so you got it all under control?
2010-04-22T10:37:00.000Z	got_a_question	crucialhoax	i just hope when i reinstall xp i can erase the current partition and choose only a few gb for it
2010-04-22T10:38:00.000Z	crucialhoax	got_a_question	Not sure, I have not done a Windows install in a looong time.
2010-04-22T10:46:00.000Z	got_a_question	crucialhoax	how long it takes quick erase in dban?
2010-04-22T10:46:00.000Z	crucialhoax	got_a_question	Over night. At the least. I believe it is like 8 hours.
2010-04-22T10:47:00.000Z	crucialhoax	got_a_question	It writes over the whole platter with 1's and 0's. very hard on an old drive, might break it so I have heard.
2010-04-22T10:47:00.000Z	crucialhoax	got_a_question	Are you that paranoid that the gov might get your songs? haha jk
2010-04-22T10:48:00.000Z	crucialhoax	got_a_question	In all seriousness, it will take over night for sure.
2010-04-22T10:57:00.000Z	crucialhoax	got_a_question	Just reformat it, after of course, yo back everything up.
2010-04-22T10:58:00.000Z	crucialhoax	got_a_question	Look, there is no such thing as secure, no matter what. So really, your best bet is just to reformat it.
2010-04-22T11:01:00.000Z	crucialhoax	got_a_question	Should have burnt it slower... IMO
