2009-08-23T22:46:00.000Z	swayric		hey.
2009-08-23T22:47:00.000Z	swayric		In ubuntu LiveCD the installer/fdisk/gparted will not detect the partition table. Any ideas?
2009-08-23T22:47:00.000Z	MTeck	swayric	9.04?
2009-08-23T22:47:00.000Z	swayric	MTeck	7.10 Live
2009-08-23T22:50:00.000Z	MTeck	swayric	any reason you're over a year behind the latest?
2009-08-23T22:50:00.000Z	MTeck	swayric	7.10 is no longer supported
2009-08-23T22:51:00.000Z	swayric	MTeck	Ubuntu Gutsy has support OOB for WG311v2 wireless card. I couldn't get it working in Jaunty so I removed it then decided I'd put on 7.10
2009-08-23T22:53:00.000Z	swayric	MTeck	I followed guides, from wicd.sourceforge.net which didn't seem to go anywhere so I ditched 9.04 for the ver giving support
2009-08-23T22:53:00.000Z	MTeck	swayric	you should file a bug or try the LTS and still file a bug
2009-08-26T02:22:00.000Z	MTeck	swayric	sounds like hardware failure
2009-08-26T02:23:00.000Z	swayric	MTeck	which hardware would have failed to cause this, if you don't mind my asking?
2009-08-26T02:24:00.000Z	MTeck	swayric	hard to tell - could be motherboard, cable, hard drive, cd drive
2009-08-26T02:26:00.000Z	swayric	MTeck	I wouldn't think its CD drive, I've tried liveUSBs and get same problem. Could be motherboard, since its ASUS and thats a company I don't trust for quality. I have extra sata cables (sata cables is what you meant?) I could try it with other cables. If its the hard drive, then why can I still see the partition table in Windows?
2009-08-26T02:27:00.000Z	MTeck	swayric	I really don't know - sorry
2009-08-26T02:29:00.000Z	swayric	MTeck	You couldn't guide me as far as commands to find out? hdparam -i? disconnecting sata drive while I'm booted into LiveCD and checking if certain parameters changed for io?
2009-08-26T02:29:00.000Z	MTeck	swayric	don't disconnect anything while being booted - aside from that I really can't
2009-08-26T02:29:00.000Z	swayric	MTeck	thanks anyway.
2009-08-26T02:48:00.000Z	MTeck	swayric	might want to file a bug
