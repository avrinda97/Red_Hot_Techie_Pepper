2010-02-05T05:21:00.000Z	Viking667	coz_	they're normally in .c format
2010-02-27T08:25:00.000Z	coz_	Viking667	 system/preferences/startup applications
2010-02-27T08:26:00.000Z	coz_	Viking667	 if that doesnt work   sudo apt-get install sysv-rc-conf  and start that in terminal with  sudo sysv-rc-conf and use the arrows to move and the space bar to x out
2010-02-27T08:29:00.000Z	Viking667	coz_	well, pulseaudio doesn't show up in that "Startup Applications", and when I try turning it off as a service, it says it's running as per-user.
2010-02-27T08:30:00.000Z	coz_	Viking667	 ok the other way is to install sysv-rc-conf
2010-02-27T08:30:00.000Z	coz_	Viking667	  sudo apt-get install sysv-rc-conf
2010-02-27T08:30:00.000Z	coz_	Viking667	  then open a terminal and type    sudo   sysv-rc-conf
2010-02-27T08:30:00.000Z	coz_	Viking667	 then use the arrows to maneuver through until you find pulseaudio  then hit the space bar to x  that
2010-02-27T08:30:00.000Z	coz_	Viking667	 then close out of the terminal and restart
2010-02-27T08:31:00.000Z	Viking667	coz_	could I simply rename the file in /etc/init/pulseaudio  instead?
2010-02-27T08:31:00.000Z	coz_	Viking667	 in karmic pulseaudio is more intricatly twined with gnome so my guess is you may have issues  but you can stop the service with sysv-rc-conf
2010-02-27T08:32:00.000Z	coz_	Viking667	 I dont know what the results will be though
2010-02-27T08:33:00.000Z	coz_	Viking667	 however you can restart it under sysv-rc-conf again if there are too many iussues
2010-02-27T08:33:00.000Z	coz_	Viking667	 pulsesaudio on karmic is definitly an issue right now
2010-08-08T15:24:00.000Z	Viking667	coz_	huh? You've done it again
2010-08-08T15:23:00.000Z	Viking667	coz_	why are your lines blank?
2010-08-08T15:23:00.000Z	coz_	Viking667	  blank??
2010-08-08T15:25:00.000Z	coz_	Viking667	 that may be on your irc client
