2009-01-06T06:34:00.000Z	rww	adam_	much, much better. And supported!
2009-01-06T07:07:00.000Z	rww	adam_	join #ubuntu-us-sc (assuming you're in South Carolina) and ask if they can send an Ubuntu CD to you.
2009-01-06T07:14:00.000Z	rww	adam_	/msg username your message
2009-01-06T07:16:00.000Z	rww	adam_	many people (especially in here) would say it's safer, yes.
2011-07-28T04:57:00.000Z	rww	adam_	because Canonical's design team had the audacity to disagree with you about the color scheme
2011-07-28T04:57:00.000Z	adam_	rww	yeah why didn't they ask me lol :)
2011-07-28T04:58:00.000Z	adam_	rww	you like these colors honestly ?
2011-07-28T04:58:00.000Z	rww	adam_	I worry about things more important than color schemes. Also, I use Kubuntu ;)
2011-07-28T04:59:00.000Z	adam_	rww	not fair ... I bet everything on gnome
2011-07-28T04:59:00.000Z	adam_	rww	i usually don't mind with apperance but when it is daily use it is annoying
2011-07-28T05:00:00.000Z	adam_	rww	just joking away nevermind
