2006-03-02T12:48:00.000Z	daryl_		unity
2006-03-02T12:49:00.000Z	daryl_		not really
2006-03-02T12:49:00.000Z	daryl_		you can save your session
2006-03-02T12:49:00.000Z	daryl_		it closes all programs and reopens them as they were
2006-03-02T12:49:00.000Z	Unity	daryl_	is that handled by gnome? or by X itself?
2006-03-02T12:50:00.000Z	daryl_	Unity	X i think
2006-03-02T12:50:00.000Z	Unity	daryl_	but if at any point, a gnome or gtk program has no display to draw to, it just quits, rght?
2006-03-02T12:51:00.000Z	daryl_	Unity	when you kill X it kills all processes running under it
2006-03-02T12:52:00.000Z	Unity	daryl_	why would it do that...?
2006-03-02T12:52:00.000Z	daryl_		why wouldn;t it?
2006-03-02T12:52:00.000Z	Unity	daryl_	it seems much more convinient to just have them draw onto a back screen or something until a new X is up
2006-03-02T12:53:00.000Z	Unity	daryl_	so that if X has to be taken down for something, i don't have to take everything else i'm running down with it
