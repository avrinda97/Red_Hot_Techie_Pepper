2007-01-22T11:45:00.000Z	daedra	Pici	sorry
2008-02-11T17:29:00.000Z	Pici	daedra	I know Sonata (mpd client) has one built in.
2008-02-26T21:48:00.000Z	Pici	daedra	#tor may be a better place to get information than in here :)
2008-02-26T21:49:00.000Z	daedra	Pici	okay ta
2008-02-26T22:02:00.000Z	daedra	Pici	#tor or the official channel are so privvy about private networks that I don't believe they exist
2008-02-26T22:02:00.000Z	Pici	daedra	*shrug* I know next to nothing about tor
2008-07-23T22:56:00.000Z	Pici	daedra	don't ask to ask, just ask.
2008-10-29T21:09:00.000Z	Pici	daedra	What are you expecting and what is happening.
2008-10-29T21:09:00.000Z	daedra	Pici	well I type info diff
2008-10-29T21:09:00.000Z	daedra	Pici	and what comes up is difftime, a feature in libc.info
2008-10-29T21:10:00.000Z	daedra	Pici	what I expect is a simple manual on the usage of diff
2008-10-29T21:10:00.000Z	Pici	daedra	Do you have the manpages package installed?
2008-10-29T21:12:00.000Z	daedra	Pici	yea
2008-10-29T21:16:00.000Z	Pici	daedra	is $infodir valued? Do info -w diff show something different than info -w difftime ?
2008-10-29T21:17:00.000Z	daedra	Pici	no
2008-10-29T21:17:00.000Z	daedra	Pici	they both point to /usr/share/info/libc.info
2008-10-29T21:20:00.000Z	Pici	daedra	Looks like glibc-doc is interfering with how info should normally work.
