2007-03-31T10:04:00.000Z	seravitae		hey i just installed mythtv, it's asking me to run a program as the mythtv user, how can i change to that user?
2007-03-31T10:04:00.000Z	seravitae		ill check it
2007-03-31T10:04:00.000Z	Chadarius	seravitae	you can use su to change users
2007-03-31T10:05:00.000Z	seravitae		i tried su - mythtv
2007-03-31T10:05:00.000Z	seravitae		but i never got told the password
2007-03-31T10:05:00.000Z	seravitae		and 'mythtv' doesnt work
2007-03-31T10:05:00.000Z	Chadarius	seravitae	su - mythtv? If you used the "-" there it won't work
2007-03-31T10:05:00.000Z	seravitae		hm
2007-03-31T10:05:00.000Z	Chadarius	seravitae	just so su mythtv
2007-03-31T10:06:00.000Z	seravitae	Chadarius	 'su mythtv' doesnt work either
2007-03-31T10:06:00.000Z	seravitae		i dont know the password.
2007-03-31T10:06:00.000Z	Chadarius	seravitae	might have to put sudo in front of that
2007-03-31T10:06:00.000Z	seravitae		sudo mythtv is a command, not entering a user state
2007-03-31T10:06:00.000Z	Chadarius	seravitae	"sudo su mythtv"
2007-03-31T10:07:00.000Z	seravitae		got it
2007-03-31T10:07:00.000Z	seravitae		thanks guys
2007-03-31T10:07:00.000Z	Chadarius	seravitae	additionally you should look into just adding your user ID to the mythtv group
2007-03-31T10:07:00.000Z	Chadarius	seravitae	anytime!
