2005-12-19T09:07:00.000Z	dpupp		need some help with TVTIME... i dont have permision to make changes to it for some odd reason. it wont even read its own... removing it does not do anything to change when reinstalling.  owner is root, permission is 700 ...and i suck at changing permissions :( help please? .
2005-12-19T09:08:00.000Z	dpupp		when running TVtime i get: Reading configuration from /etc/tvtime/tvtime.xml
2005-12-19T09:08:00.000Z	dpupp		I/O warning : failed to load external entity "/home/ookami/.tvtime/tvtime.xml"
2005-12-19T09:09:00.000Z	dpupp		i/o permission denied.
2005-12-19T09:10:00.000Z	dpupp		toma- no i havent.
2005-12-19T09:10:00.000Z	meuserj|work	dpupp	it sounds like you don't have permission to read .tvtime
2005-12-19T09:10:00.000Z	meuserj|work	dpupp	try this
2005-12-19T09:10:00.000Z	meuserj|work	dpupp	do you own the dir
2005-12-19T09:12:00.000Z	meuserj|work	dpupp	ls -ld .tvtime
2005-12-19T09:12:00.000Z	meuserj|work	dpupp	ls -ld .tvtime
2005-12-19T09:12:00.000Z	meuserj|work	dpupp	the d is important
2005-12-19T09:13:00.000Z	meuserj|work	dpupp	ok... do this
2005-12-19T09:14:00.000Z	meuserj|work	dpupp	you must have run it as root at some point
2005-12-19T09:15:00.000Z	meuserj|work	dpupp	right.. but it shouldn't have written your .tvtime files as root unless you accidentally ran tvtime as root
2005-12-19T09:15:00.000Z	meuserj|work	dpupp	great
2005-12-19T09:16:00.000Z	dpupp	meuserj|work	, thanks :)
2005-12-19T09:17:00.000Z	meuserj|work	dpupp	np
2005-12-19T09:17:00.000Z	meuserj|work	dpupp	you probably did it with sudo
