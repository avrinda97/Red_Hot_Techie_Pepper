2009-05-27T14:27:00.000Z	Jackncoke23	gordonjcp	and robbie_crash  : no it didn't work
2009-05-27T14:29:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Jackncoke23	hi
2009-05-27T14:29:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Jackncoke23	it didn't sound like that was what the problem was
2009-05-27T14:30:00.000Z	Jackncoke23	gordonjcp	: yes well i figured it wouldn't hurt to try
2009-05-27T14:30:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Jackncoke23	it does sound like you're not picking up a network address properly
2009-05-27T14:31:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Jackncoke23	check that you've got a sensible-looking IP address, gateway address and DNS
2009-05-27T14:31:00.000Z	Jackncoke23	gordonjcp	: well i've turned off ip6 because i thought that might be a problem.
2009-05-27T14:31:00.000Z	Jackncoke23	gordonjcp	: i'm getting the sameone as i do in windows for the most part. sometimes the ip changes on either on since they are not set
2009-05-27T14:31:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Jackncoke23	okay
2009-05-27T14:32:00.000Z	Jackncoke23	gordonjcp	: Address Not Found
2009-05-27T14:32:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Jackncoke23	that makes sense, it should hand off the same IP to the same mac address
2009-05-27T14:32:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Jackncoke23	what about DNS?
2009-05-27T14:35:00.000Z	Jackncoke23	gordonjcp	: dns is good, gateway is good, ip changes sometimes.
2009-05-27T14:36:00.000Z	Jackncoke23	gordonjcp	: i can't ping anything, i can't finger or who is anything, i can't trace my route either
2009-05-27T14:38:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Jackncoke23	what happens when you try?
2009-05-27T14:40:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Jackncoke23	okay, forget that bit and use a terminal
2009-05-27T14:41:00.000Z	Jackncoke23	gordonjcp	ok i'll need you to walk me through the terminal in linux. i'm kind of new and just started to figure everything out. it has similar, yet different commands than dos
2009-05-27T14:41:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Jackncoke23	tell you what, take it to pm so we don't annoy the channel
