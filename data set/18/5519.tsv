2011-06-29T12:20:00.000Z	morth		i cant find a guide out on how to keybind terminal to mod4 key
2011-06-29T12:20:00.000Z	hdon	morth	i had no luck binding to mod4, i used mod4+space instead.
2011-06-29T12:21:00.000Z	morth	hdon	ill try that
2011-06-29T12:26:00.000Z	morth	hdon	how do i keybind it?
2011-06-29T12:27:00.000Z	hdon	morth	System menu, Preferences, Keyboard Shortcuts
2011-06-29T12:27:00.000Z	hdon	morth	i believe under the Desktop section, there is something called "Run a terminal" that will open a new gnome-terminal window
2011-06-29T12:28:00.000Z	morth	hdon	i keybound it to the terminal but when i use the shortcut it doesn't pop up?... :s
2011-06-29T12:29:00.000Z	hdon	morth	what key did you bind?
2011-06-29T12:31:00.000Z	morth	hdon	windows key + space
2011-06-29T12:32:00.000Z	hdon	morth	oh... hmm...
2011-06-29T12:36:00.000Z	morth	hdon	i got it working, had to add a new keyline and add gnome-terminal, the default didn't work.
2011-06-29T12:37:00.000Z	hdon	morth	haha, very weird! thanks for the tip :)
2011-06-29T12:37:00.000Z	morth	hdon	thanks for the effort.
2011-06-29T12:38:00.000Z	morth	hdon	actually, is there any way i can make it so i only hae to use mod4 (win key), rather than mod4+space?
2011-06-29T12:39:00.000Z	morth	hdon	it doesn't do anything if i only click mod4, but if i do a combo it works :s
2011-06-29T12:40:00.000Z	hdon	morth	i've tried that many times on ubuntu :( never got it to work
2011-06-29T12:41:00.000Z	morth	hdon	okay, if i figure it out ill be sure to tell you.
2011-06-29T12:41:00.000Z	hdon	morth	ok, but /msg it to me or i will miss it!
