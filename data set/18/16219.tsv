2004-12-16T11:28:00.000Z	ogra	eyal	it should point to your desktop with the forwarding
2004-12-16T11:28:00.000Z	eyal	ogra	?
2004-12-16T11:28:00.000Z	ogra	eyal	then xmule will just work
2004-12-16T11:29:00.000Z	ogra	eyal	forwarding means you have a source and a destionation set at your router
2004-12-16T11:29:00.000Z	ogra	eyal	source is the internet in this case....dest is your desktop
2004-12-16T11:30:00.000Z	ogra	eyal	said....you route requests form the internet to port 4662 (or so) directly to your desktop inhstead of using NAT
2004-12-16T11:31:00.000Z	ogra	eyal	its in any case a setup at your router, not at your desktop
2004-12-16T11:32:00.000Z	eyal	ogra	: so what do i do? in the win2000 it worked(emule) there i opened the relevance ports
2004-12-16T11:32:00.000Z	ogra	eyal	you dont need to open any specific ports on your desktop...xmule does it if it runs....
2004-12-16T11:33:00.000Z	ogra	eyal	i guess you have some kind of personal firewall on your win box ?
2004-12-16T11:33:00.000Z	ogra	eyal	the serverlist is ok ?
2004-12-16T11:34:00.000Z	eyal	ogra	: it doesn;t preview user number
2004-12-16T11:36:00.000Z	eyal	ogra	: now it connected to razorback 2
