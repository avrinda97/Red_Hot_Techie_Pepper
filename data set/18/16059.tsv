2004-12-11T09:03:00.000Z	CraHan		I always rename Sxxscript to sxxscript
2004-12-11T09:04:00.000Z	CraHan		that way I know it was in there, but doesn't start
2004-12-11T09:04:00.000Z	lemsx1	CraHan	you lowercase the name? scarry
2004-12-11T09:04:00.000Z	CraHan	lemsx1	yes I lowercase the name
2004-12-11T09:05:00.000Z	CraHan	lemsx1	works nicely since the scripts expect to find a capital S to run the script
2004-12-11T09:05:00.000Z	lemsx1	CraHan	i guess you change all other references to that from all the other scripts
2004-12-11T09:05:00.000Z	CraHan	lemsx1	how do you mean?
2004-12-11T09:05:00.000Z	lemsx1	CraHan	ah, you mean to not run it... that's ok then
2004-12-11T09:05:00.000Z	CraHan	lemsx1	yeah indeed :)
2004-12-11T09:05:00.000Z	lemsx1	CraHan	but it's better to make it: S20script -> renamed -> K20script
2004-12-11T09:06:00.000Z	lemsx1	CraHan	that way when you do "telinit #" the stuff will actually be stopped
2004-12-11T09:06:00.000Z	CraHan		true
2004-12-11T09:06:00.000Z	lemsx1	CraHan	I never reboot my systems :-) i use telinit 1 and CTRL+D whenever i want to make sure everything is stopped and restarted quickly
2004-12-11T09:06:00.000Z	CraHan		of course each time you restart the system or change the runlevel after that one time it'll try to stop the daemons again
2004-12-11T09:07:00.000Z	CraHan		ah ok
2004-12-11T09:07:00.000Z	CraHan		<---- laptop here :)
2004-12-11T09:07:00.000Z	lemsx1	CraHan	"restarted" meaning I don't have to do: for i in `/bin/ls /etc/init.d/*`; do $i stop && $i start;done
2004-12-11T09:07:00.000Z	CraHan	lemsx1	ic
