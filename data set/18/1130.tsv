2011-05-24T21:57:00.000Z	pythonirc101		what is a good command to list all audio devices in ubuntu
2011-05-24T21:57:00.000Z	sudokill	pythonirc101	 is it usb
2011-05-24T21:58:00.000Z	sudokill	pythonirc101	 if its usb u have to mount it in the virtualbox window
2011-05-24T22:00:00.000Z	sudokill	pythonirc101	 im not sure if its compaable but it should be
2011-05-24T22:01:00.000Z	sudokill	pythonirc101	 playing with the usb can cause it to hang
2011-05-24T22:02:00.000Z	sudokill	pythonirc101	 sorry im not sure, you could try rebooting it and try again
2011-05-24T22:03:00.000Z	sudokill	pythonirc101	 try in vbox options something in the usb settings
2011-05-24T22:04:00.000Z	sudokill	pythonirc101	 i thin ktheres an option to allow usb devices through
2011-05-24T22:05:00.000Z	pythonirc101	sudokill	I do have usb passthru enabled
2011-05-24T22:06:00.000Z	sudokill	pythonirc101	 has that always been on?
2011-05-24T22:06:00.000Z	sudokill	pythonirc101	 no it seems a vbox problem not ubuntu
2011-05-24T22:06:00.000Z	sudokill	pythonirc101	 can i ask what the point of this is if ur running windows as well?
2011-05-24T22:07:00.000Z	pythonirc101	sudokill	I use ubuntu, my boss uses windows . Sorry
2011-05-24T22:08:00.000Z	sudokill	pythonirc101	 try disabling the passthrough, and when u boot into ubuntu then manually select the headset from the vbox window
2011-05-24T22:08:00.000Z	pythonirc101	sudokill	I know that vbox is exporting that usb port to ubuntu...how do i check what is going wrong?
2011-05-24T22:08:00.000Z	pythonirc101	sudokill	I tried that first...didnt work
2011-05-24T22:10:00.000Z	sudokill	pythonirc101	 hmm im really not sure, sorry :( i havent used vbox in ages but i remmeber having problems with a flash drive once that i solved by playing with the passthrough etc
