2008-05-22T05:42:00.000Z	crislsizl		i know but tomorrow is not a labour day
2008-05-22T05:43:00.000Z	crislsizl		i got a problem with my graphics card on ubuntu 8.04. can anyone help me???
2008-05-22T05:44:00.000Z	bazhang	crislsizl	give us more info :)
2008-05-22T05:45:00.000Z	bazhang	crislsizl	you can get compiz with that?
2008-05-22T05:46:00.000Z	crislsizl	bazhang	its not about compiz (compiz works) its about playing videos in the browser
2008-05-22T05:46:00.000Z	bazhang	crislsizl	right; just wanted to clarify before my next question
2008-05-22T05:49:00.000Z	bazhang	crislsizl	go into synaptic and search for intel and see if the drivers for that card are installed
2008-05-22T05:54:00.000Z	crislsizl	bazhang	 seems that its installed
2008-05-22T05:55:00.000Z	bazhang	crislsizl	you want to view youtube fullscreen in firefox, miro or other? either dl'ing the youtube (youtube-dl package) or watching in miro (package) are better options imo
2008-05-22T05:58:00.000Z	bazhang	crislsizl	no idea what he was recommending, sorry
2008-05-22T05:59:00.000Z	crislsizl	bazhang	u havent got any clue how i could get my intel 855 card working correctly?
2008-05-22T06:00:00.000Z	bazhang	crislsizl	for youtube videos fullscreen? they are of such poor quality no video card is going to help that much-->I gave my best two suggestions
2008-05-22T06:04:00.000Z	crislsizl	bazhang	honestly i am a noob, so it might be that i didnt find it although it is in the web. but i already searched for this problem and found nothing
