2009-09-08T11:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MeXTuX	depends on what core2 quad you have?
2009-09-08T12:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MeXTuX	looks like it is 64bit but 64bit CPUs can run 32bit OSes
2009-09-09T03:29:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MeXTuX	if the cpu is 64bit, use 64bit linux
2009-09-09T03:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MeXTuX	its just 64bit, it will work on both intel and amd
2010-08-28T04:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MeXTuX	32bit is still more supported by 3rd party sources but you can use either. If you have less than 3Gb ram and only need "normal" desktop stuff then I'd shoot for 32bit
2011-11-02T03:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MeXTuX	uninstall the driver then reboot to use the open driver
2011-11-02T03:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MeXTuX	you can get the 285 driver using the xorg edgers updates ppa
2011-11-02T03:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MeXTuX	not the xorg edgers ppa itself, they have a slightly stabler branch
2011-11-02T03:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MeXTuX	no, if you use the packages instead of the driver from the nvidia site it will do it for you
2011-11-02T03:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MeXTuX	you will need to do it each time with the manual install as you have done
2011-11-02T03:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MeXTuX	the packages add dkms data which will generate the module each time, you have bypassed this
2011-11-02T03:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MeXTuX	sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-x-swat/x-updates; sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install nvidia-current    and you'll be fine and have no issues. Why did you use the manual method in the first place??
2012-02-18T06:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MeXTuX	what chip does it use?
2012-02-18T06:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MeXTuX	run:   lsusb    use the 8 character hex id to find guides
2012-09-10T19:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	MeXTuX	is there a PPA for it?
