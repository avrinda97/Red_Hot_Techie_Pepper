2006-03-06T07:03:00.000Z	nbjayme	damian_	i have a cd player that can accept mp3 files too. the mp3 that i converted from mplayer+lame cannot be played. :( but the other files of type mpeg1 can be. i used totem to check the properties of mp3 files.
2006-03-06T07:04:00.000Z	nbjayme		mplayer+lame results to mpegII Layer 3 CBR
2006-03-06T07:05:00.000Z	nbjayme	damian_	you can play mp3 in totem then check the properties under movie menu.
