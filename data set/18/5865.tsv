2008-08-27T05:25:00.000Z	Kharnov		Hey everyone, I seem to be having a bit of a problem. My memory usage is bizarrely high, and I've already checked all running processes. Nothing could possibly be using this much memory.
2008-08-27T05:26:00.000Z	bofh80	Kharnov	are running any windows apps?
2008-08-27T05:26:00.000Z	Kharnov	bofh80	no.
2008-08-27T05:26:00.000Z	bofh80	Kharnov	if you bring up system monitor, and check the virtual memory colum . . . do you see anything?
2008-08-27T05:27:00.000Z	Kharnov	bofh80	I don't see a virtual memory column.
2008-08-27T05:28:00.000Z	bofh80	Kharnov	goto Edit > Preferences in the system monitor
2008-08-27T05:28:00.000Z	bofh80	Kharnov	and the little list in the bottom of the box, you can put a check box in virtual memory
2008-08-27T05:30:00.000Z	Kharnov	bofh80	Okay, I enabled it. A lot is being used by Epiphany, but I already cleared the cache for it.
2008-08-27T05:31:00.000Z	bofh80	Kharnov	does it appear to be the culprit? ie the exessive use you mentioned?
2008-08-27T05:32:00.000Z	Kharnov	bofh80	Yeah. Nearly 200 MB being used up.
2008-08-27T05:32:00.000Z	bofh80	Kharnov	do you have many web pages open in it?
2008-08-27T05:33:00.000Z	Kharnov	bofh80	No. Only one page running, and I cleared the cache.
2008-08-27T05:33:00.000Z	bofh80	Kharnov	if you change that to a simple page like www.google.com does the memory amount remain that high?
2008-08-27T05:34:00.000Z	Kharnov	bofh80	Yes. Only lowers by about 20 MB, but still high.
2008-08-27T05:35:00.000Z	bofh80	Kharnov	do you like ephinany that much? don't want to use firefox or opera ?
2008-08-27T05:35:00.000Z	Kharnov	bofh80	I'm on Epiphany because I'm trying to reduce my memory usage, but for some reason it's actually using more. What the heck.
2008-08-27T05:35:00.000Z	bofh80	Kharnov	ah i see, i read something somewhere i can't remmeber . lemmie seee . . .
2008-08-27T05:38:00.000Z	Kharnov	bofh80	I tried using Opera a few times but got annoyed because I was so used to Firefox, which I've been using for years now. Epiphany was similar enough, so I tried it out. Any other good pseudo-Firefoxes?
