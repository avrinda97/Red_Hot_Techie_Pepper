2008-06-15T21:09:00.000Z	perplexed		dmacnutt: its just my personal laptop. besides maybe a private file server, web server, 3 or 4 users, nothing
2008-06-15T21:10:00.000Z	perplexed		dual booting with windows vista, will that slow my system up in any way? and do you guys really think i should use a 64 bit arch livecd or just go with 32 bit?
2008-06-15T21:10:00.000Z	perplexed		will i get the same performance?
2008-06-15T21:12:00.000Z	perplexed		dont want to wipe out vista, and i get unfixable trouble with ubuntu
2008-06-15T21:12:00.000Z	perplexed		ill be pissed
2008-06-15T21:12:00.000Z	LimCore	perplexed	I use 64bit,  but I would try 32 bit to avoid some problems
2008-06-15T21:13:00.000Z	perplexed	LimCore	did u have a ton of problems?
2008-06-15T21:13:00.000Z	perplexed		and 32 bit amd arch?
2008-06-15T21:14:00.000Z	LimCore	perplexed	no problems for me
2008-06-15T21:14:00.000Z	LimCore	perplexed	but SOME things SOMETIMES work a bit worse in 64 bit
2008-06-15T21:14:00.000Z	perplexed	LimCore	hmm
2008-06-15T21:15:00.000Z	LimCore	perplexed	in example I guess some java applications
2008-06-15T21:15:00.000Z	LimCore	perplexed	if I would be totall newbie I would go 32b.
2008-06-15T21:15:00.000Z	perplexed	LimCore	im not a total newbie to linux or unix in general, simply with installing a distro with these hardware specs.
2008-06-15T21:16:00.000Z	perplexed		i dont mind doing a bit of tweaking, but i want to make sure that its actually possible to get these things working fully
2008-06-15T21:16:00.000Z	LimCore	perplexed	I guess ubuntu would be ok.. but compiz is not perfect
2008-06-15T21:16:00.000Z	LimCore		what webbrowser have spellcheck?
2008-06-15T21:16:00.000Z	perplexed	LimCore	compiz?
