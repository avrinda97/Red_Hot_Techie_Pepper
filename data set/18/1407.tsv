2011-02-27T12:33:00.000Z	fidyduce		hello all
2011-02-27T12:35:00.000Z	fidyduce		can i move the current ubuntu install on my laptop to a pendrive... keeping all drivers and profiles?
2011-02-27T12:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fidyduce	 i think its possible. but  may take some work. (like most things in linux)
2011-02-27T12:36:00.000Z	fidyduce	Dr_Willis	lol i am game
2011-02-27T12:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fidyduce	 thers some tools out there to let you 'remaster' your system onto a 'live cd' type setup. Or you could just start using 'dd'  and try cloning the HD to the other drive.  be carefull with dd.. one typo can erase the system :)
2011-02-27T12:38:00.000Z	fidyduce	Dr_Willis	ok if there is a forum i could read and study up before my new thumbdrive gets here that would be awesome. really it is not a big deal i will just use the new netbook edition if all else fails...
2011-02-27T12:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fidyduce	 it depends on exactly what you want to do really. theres some remaster guides. or just check out the '!clone' factoid.
2011-03-06T00:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fidyduce	 you sure you dont mean /home/YOURUSERNAME/newisofile.iso
2011-03-06T00:29:00.000Z	fidyduce	Dr_Willis	well i will be more sure here in a minute when i give that a try.... :D
2011-03-06T00:31:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fidyduce	 i would google for examples of using that command.
2011-03-06T00:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fidyduce	 i think you need to be telling it some path to your data you want to put on the iso file
2011-03-06T00:32:00.000Z	fidyduce	Dr_Willis	here is were this all started
2011-03-06T00:32:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fidyduce	 ive only used kiso to do similer tasks..  but that was ages ago.
2011-03-06T00:33:00.000Z	fidyduce	Dr_Willis	that is fine, i have that installed as luck would have it....
2011-03-06T00:33:00.000Z	fidyduce	Dr_Willis	but i could not figure out how to do the same thing...
2011-03-28T21:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fidyduce	 thats the default file manager.
2011-03-28T21:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	fidyduce	 double click on any folder opens nautilus
2011-03-28T21:52:00.000Z	fidyduce	Dr_Willis	see that is why i came in here for help....
