2011-05-12T12:40:00.000Z	Neirad		Hey everyone! I'm having difficulty with installing photoshop with wine. Can anyone help me?
2011-05-12T12:40:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Neirad	Which version?
2011-05-12T12:41:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Neirad	of Photoshop
2011-05-12T12:41:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Neirad	ActionParsnip Good luck with appdb I find it quite useless most of the time!
2011-05-12T12:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Neirad	right yeah that's probably it then
2011-05-12T12:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Neirad	take Photoshop 7 for example, that is bound to work rather well in Wine
2011-05-12T12:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Neirad	,but the rather latest versions, well they won't work that well in it
2011-05-12T12:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Neirad	altough it seems from what I read not that long ago, that Adobe may even eventaully port Photoshop natively to Linux :)
2011-05-12T12:43:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Neirad	again depends on the version. also with Wine it can depend on how you set things up how well an app works or not
2011-05-12T12:43:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Neirad	and playing around with wineconf isn't realy for the average user, but luckily ther are programs that can help do that kind of thing for you, such as playonlinux mainly for games, and uhmm winetricks
2011-05-12T12:44:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Neirad	well why you want Photoshop and Dreamwaver so bad anyway?  we do have alternaives :)  ok sure they don't quite have as much features as the propritary programs, but even so are pretty good
2011-05-12T12:45:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Neirad	Ok how much RAM you got?
2011-05-12T12:46:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Neirad	yes I am thinking maybe you can virtual machine them,  if you don't want to just use a pshyicall install of Windows for it,  yeah with 2GB you can maybe do what I am suggesting,  I guess to some extent would depend on other hardawre you got as well though, but worth a try
2011-05-12T12:47:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Neirad	that factoid needs updating I think, because I think now there's only really one version, and the propritary stuff such as USB support can be added.  By the way it's ok to use Windows still for some programs really, Linux distro' are meant to replace Unix rather fully, not Windows.
2011-05-12T12:48:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Neirad	Virtualbox allows an OS to run inside an OS
2011-05-12T12:48:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Neirad	works rather well except for 3D programs for example
2011-05-12T12:49:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Neirad	with 2GB RAM, you got more than enough for a virtual machine though :)
2011-05-12T12:52:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Neirad	 off topic now really, but uhmm if it's true that you really need Photoshop for school that's quite stupid really, because ideally they should be teaching you how to make graphics in more than one program, and then letting you also choose what to use :)
