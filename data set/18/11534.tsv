2006-08-17T14:37:00.000Z	Mattchewie		Any Nvidia Driver guru's in #ubuntu tonight?...if so, I totally need to chat with you :D
2006-08-17T14:37:00.000Z	mneptok	Mattchewie	you a BX user?
2006-08-17T14:38:00.000Z	Mattchewie	mneptok	hehe yeah I mean on Kubuntu I use Konversation of course but I like bx :)
2006-08-17T14:38:00.000Z	mneptok	Mattchewie	ever used the ankh-bx script? if not, i highly recommend it. i can DCC a copy, if you want.
2006-08-17T14:38:00.000Z	Mattchewie	mneptok	....ankh-bx script huh? what does it do?
2006-08-17T14:39:00.000Z	mneptok	Mattchewie	makes BX actually really pretty to look at. it's a usability script by my friend Liam of the W3c.
2006-08-17T14:39:00.000Z	mneptok	Mattchewie	sec, i'll send it over.
2006-08-17T14:40:00.000Z	Mattchewie	mneptok	Hrm, I hope my firewall lets this trough. I don't DCC much on IRC ...so I can't remember if I have the ports forwarded or not
2006-08-17T14:41:00.000Z	mneptok	Mattchewie	i can http-ify it for you.
2006-08-17T14:41:00.000Z	Mattchewie	mneptok	yeah if you could!
2006-08-17T14:42:00.000Z	Mattchewie	mneptok	Awesome, thanks
2006-08-17T14:43:00.000Z	mneptok	Mattchewie	np np. enjoy. i can't use BX without it.
2006-08-17T14:43:00.000Z	Mattchewie	mneptok	you don't happen to know anything about nvidia drivers do ya :P haah cause I'm in a pickle I think.
2006-08-17T14:44:00.000Z	mneptok	Mattchewie	i install the nvidia-glx drivers via Synaptic. path of least resistance
2006-08-17T14:44:00.000Z	mneptok	Mattchewie	if you're using the nVidia binary blob, be sure to run the installer as root ;)
2006-08-17T14:46:00.000Z	Mattchewie	mneptok	Aye, I have taken that route too but when I restart x.....No Nvid logo displays...so I'm thinking something isn't stiring the kool aid
2006-08-17T14:46:00.000Z	mneptok	Mattchewie	sure sounds like it's not working. run the installer again and use it to uninstall. then try the nvidia-glx driver package from Synaptic/apt
2006-08-17T14:48:00.000Z	Mattchewie	mneptok	well the nvidia-glx driver from apt/ubuntu repo's is the one I installed/ trying to use...I mean it worked great on my other pc with my 7600 GT, just this darn cheapo machine with the Fx5200 I bought doesn't seem to want to take it!!! GRAW!
