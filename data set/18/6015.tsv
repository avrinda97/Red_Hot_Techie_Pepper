2009-09-08T07:27:00.000Z	WIGGMPk		Can someone take a look at this http://paste.ubuntu.com/266960/ and digest whats going on here? Also, how to fix it would help too lol thanks.
2009-09-08T07:28:00.000Z	Vovk	WIGGMPk	err... what did you do to cause that output
2009-09-08T07:29:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	Vovk	lol I emptied my Trash can... nautilus looks like it crashed.. or stopped ? so I checked the logs.. I was burning some ISO's.. seems to happen when I use Brasero a lot
2009-09-08T07:31:00.000Z	Vovk	WIGGMPk	err... does nautilus still work?
2009-09-08T07:32:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	Vovk	since I restarted yes.. full restart too.. restarting the X server is not fun.. crashes ~6 times in 90 seconds.. lucky its idiot proof and it stops trying to restart itself.. at that point I went to another TTY and did a full restart
2009-09-08T07:32:00.000Z	Vovk	WIGGMPk	hmm... have no experience with that, sorry :(
2009-09-08T07:33:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	Vovk	thanks for taking a look though
2009-09-08T07:33:00.000Z	Vovk	WIGGMPk	hope you find help. alternatively, you'll just have to restart when that happens :(
2009-09-08T07:34:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	Vovk	im almost sure its Brasero or growiso's fault
2009-09-08T07:34:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	Vovk	leaning towards Brasero.. I think its a POS honestly
2009-09-08T07:34:00.000Z	Vovk	WIGGMPk	well, the pastebin says that scim panel is segfaulting. i did a google search of "scim panel gtk segfault" and there are alot of results. look into that
2009-09-08T07:35:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	Vovk	will do
2009-09-08T07:35:00.000Z	Vovk	WIGGMPk	if it IS a problem with gtk, try using K3B to burn things, it runs on top of qt so you may not have that issue
2009-09-08T07:36:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	Vovk	I dislike using KDE apps on GNOME (dont get me wrong, K3B is a nice program I just have OCD). Might just end up doing the old growisofs from command line
2009-09-08T07:37:00.000Z	Vovk	WIGGMPk	yeah, running kde and qt will slow down your gnome (loads all the extra libraries and all...) hehehe. not afraid of the black and white letters then? Excellent :D
2009-09-08T07:37:00.000Z	Vovk	WIGGMPk	you could even write your own shell scripts to make it (mostly) automated
2009-09-08T07:38:00.000Z	WIGGMPk	Vovk	lol, I was just gonna say I wasnt afraid of the terminal.. just lazy.. write a shell script? thats a lil much for this lazy cat..
