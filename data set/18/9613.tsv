2011-02-03T02:54:00.000Z	ChaosR		hello, I have a Radeon HD5670, I installed the proprietary drivers, however, video playback is horrible, it isnt slow, but it does stutter
2011-02-03T02:54:00.000Z	ChaosR		can anybody help me solve that?
2011-02-03T02:55:00.000Z	Kyle___	ChaosR	totem is solid, but slow in my experience.  Try playing your video back with mplayer, see how it goes.
2011-02-03T02:55:00.000Z	ChaosR	Kyle___	I am using mplayer, from svn
2011-02-03T02:55:00.000Z	ChaosR	Kyle___	same problem with vlc and even chromium
2011-02-03T02:55:00.000Z	Kyle___	ChaosR	Damn.  OK.  I'd just revert back to the opensource drivers then :( sorry.
2011-02-03T02:56:00.000Z	Kyle___	ChaosR	On my wimpy netbook, I can watch full screen 1080i and 720p video with mplayer, but it's a slideshow with totem.
2011-02-03T02:56:00.000Z	Kyle___	ChaosR	If you're using a svn of mplayer :) yea, it's the drivers, nothign to do but revert.
2011-02-03T02:56:00.000Z	ChaosR	Kyle___	yeh, I know the issue
2011-02-03T02:56:00.000Z	ChaosR	Kyle___	opensource didnt have 3d support though
2011-02-03T02:57:00.000Z	Kyle___	ChaosR	Hum.   Using it for games?
2011-02-03T02:57:00.000Z	ChaosR	Kyle___	yeh
2011-02-03T02:57:00.000Z	Kyle___		damn.
2011-02-03T02:57:00.000Z	Kyle___	ChaosR	what about the opengl driver in mplayer?
2011-02-03T02:58:00.000Z	Kyle___	ChaosR	Or I suppose you could see if there's a way to set per-user video drivers...make a games user for the ATI driver, other users use the xorg driver?
2011-02-03T02:58:00.000Z	ChaosR	Kyle___	nah, that would be to troublesome
2011-02-03T02:58:00.000Z	Kyle___	ChaosR	I figured as much, but it's been something I've been tmepted to try on occasion...
2011-02-03T03:00:00.000Z	ChaosR	Kyle___	interestingly enough, gl_nosw doesnt seem to have the stutter
