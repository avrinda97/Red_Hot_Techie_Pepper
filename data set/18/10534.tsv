2009-09-13T13:33:00.000Z	NeoCicak		hello....... i have a problem with desktop effect.... it used to work.... but i disabled it today, and when i tried to enable it back (normal, not extra), it says "desktop effects could not be enabled"... i'm wondering where I can find more details (log files?)
2009-09-13T13:35:00.000Z	Slart	NeoCicak	you could try looking at /var/log/Xorg.0.log .. there you'll see which graphics drivers you're using amongst other things.. also the /var/log/syslog file might tell you some general stuff
2009-09-13T13:36:00.000Z	NeoCicak	Slart	i've checked /var/log/Xorg.0.log... but there isnt any error message there :(
2009-09-13T13:37:00.000Z	Slart	NeoCicak	usually that error means you're not running a graphics driver capable or doing accelerated 3d stuff.. what kind of graphics card are you using?
2009-09-13T13:37:00.000Z	NeoCicak	Slart	hmmmm... but it works before, and i havnet applied any update to graphic driver
2009-09-13T13:38:00.000Z	Slart	NeoCicak	perhaps a kernel update from the repos?
2009-09-13T13:38:00.000Z	NeoCicak	Slart	i have nvidia quadro 140
2009-09-13T13:38:00.000Z	NeoCicak	Slart	nope... no kernel update...
2009-09-13T13:41:00.000Z	Slart	NeoCicak	sometimes gnome gets the idea that it should bring it's own composite stuff.. that messes a lot of stuff up.. run gconf-editor from a terminal and go to apps, metacity, general and see if "compositing manager" is checked.. it shouldn't be
2009-09-13T13:41:00.000Z	Slart	NeoCicak	you can also use this little script .. it might be helpful http://forlong.blogage.de/entries/pages/Compiz-Check
2009-09-13T13:42:00.000Z	NeoCicak	Slart	oh wow... it works now!!!
2009-09-13T13:42:00.000Z	NeoCicak	Slart	whats that 'compositing manager' thing?
2009-09-13T13:43:00.000Z	Slart	NeoCicak	compositing is what makes compiz able to throw windows around and such.. I think metacity has some own weird implementation of it that doesn't work with anything else on the system
2009-09-13T13:44:00.000Z	NeoCicak	Slart	so.... by checking it in... what does it mean?
2009-09-13T13:44:00.000Z	Slart	NeoCicak	it means metacity enables its own compositing stuff
2009-09-13T13:44:00.000Z	NeoCicak	Slart	ic..... and if we uncheck it... we use compiz?
2009-09-13T13:45:00.000Z	Slart	NeoCicak	as far as I can tell, yes.. I haven't looked into the source code or anything. I'm basically just guessing.. but still
2009-09-13T13:45:00.000Z	NeoCicak	Slart	ah ok..... anyway... it works now :) thanks a lot!
