2008-04-30T13:51:00.000Z	KalEl		ever since i upgraded to the last firefox 3 beta in hardy, it keeps slowing down and stops to respond from time to time while using the hard disk for some reason
2008-04-30T13:51:00.000Z	KalEl		is there a chance i can get the bete version before the latest one? that was much smoother
2008-04-30T13:52:00.000Z	KalEl		the one before the latest beta
2008-04-30T13:52:00.000Z	KalEl		there was some upgrade which update ff3 beta and that's causing the problem
2008-04-30T13:54:00.000Z	KalEl		how can i see the cache size used by firefox 3? i suspect that might also be the problem
2008-04-30T13:56:00.000Z	KalEl		thanks patifa
2008-04-30T13:56:00.000Z	KalEl		is there any way to track what is reading from/writing to the hard disk with hardy? from time to time hard disk gets excited and system stops responding
2008-04-30T13:58:00.000Z	KalEl		how can i check if the ubuntu cache partition is working fine?
2008-04-30T13:59:00.000Z	DistroJockey	KalEl	you mean swap partition?
2008-04-30T13:59:00.000Z	KalEl		swap partition correct DistroJockey thanks
2008-04-30T14:00:00.000Z	DistroJockey	KalEl	well, typing    free   in a terminal should do the job
2008-04-30T14:00:00.000Z	KalEl		thanks patifa DistroJockey
2008-04-30T14:01:00.000Z	DistroJockey	KalEl	or   cat /proc/meminfo
2008-04-30T14:01:00.000Z	DistroJockey	KalEl	you're welcome
2008-04-30T14:02:00.000Z	KalEl		hmm my memory is all free still firefox 3 wants to access hard disk for anything i do
2008-04-30T14:02:00.000Z	KalEl	DistroJockey	actually it's some one else's nick who also answered me :)
2008-04-30T14:03:00.000Z	DistroJockey	KalEl	ohh, ahh, sorry patifa :)
2008-04-30T14:04:00.000Z	DistroJockey	KalEl	I guess you could install firefox-2 and see if you have the same issue
