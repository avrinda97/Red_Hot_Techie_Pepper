2006-07-24T15:17:00.000Z	sethk	Bonez56	when you change kernel versions, you have to rebuild the nvidia drivers
2006-07-24T15:17:00.000Z	Bonez56	sethk	last time I installed them I used automatix to do it.
2006-07-24T15:17:00.000Z	sethk	Bonez56	so do exactly what you did initially when you installed the nvidia drivers
2006-07-24T15:18:00.000Z	sethk	Bonez56	I don't use automatix, so I don't know if you can use it again
2006-07-24T15:18:00.000Z	Bonez56	sethk	well at the moment i can't even start x. i think ill edit the xorg file and change it to vesa or nv and see if that will get me going
2006-07-24T15:18:00.000Z	sethk	Bonez56	easier to use dpkg-reconfigure xorg-xserver
2006-07-24T15:19:00.000Z	Bonez56	sethk	thanks ill give it a shot
2006-09-30T07:15:00.000Z	sethk	Bonez56	kernel modules must match the running kernel
2006-09-30T07:16:00.000Z	Bonez56	sethk	yeah, i have a stock standard ubuntu install with linux-686 and the module that comes with the package doesnt work.
2006-09-30T07:16:00.000Z	sethk	Bonez56	effectively that means you have to build the kernel module locally.
2006-09-30T07:16:00.000Z	Bonez56	sethk	yeah i think ill just grab the source and build it
2006-09-30T07:16:00.000Z	sethk	Bonez56	it's common, in a binary distro they update the kernel, and then all sorts of modules refuse to load
2006-09-30T07:16:00.000Z	Bonez56	sethk	roger
2006-11-07T12:27:00.000Z	sethk	Bonez56	you can ssh into it?
