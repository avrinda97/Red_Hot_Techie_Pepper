2006-06-23T13:13:00.000Z	Sjoerd-	cwillu	Package libapache-mod-php5 is not available
2006-06-23T13:16:00.000Z	Sjoerd-	cwillu	/ uniq: all three packages are installed but php still doesn't seem to work, any other idea's?
2006-06-23T13:17:00.000Z	Sjoerd-	cwillu	I have gone through my config looking for lines with php in it, only thing I found was the two lines i mentioned earlier, i uncommented them both
2006-06-23T13:18:00.000Z	Sjoerd-	cwillu	php5 php5-common libapache2-mod-php5
