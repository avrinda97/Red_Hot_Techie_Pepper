2009-01-16T05:47:00.000Z	sidney		I have a pcchip MB wita a LAN - VIA VT6103 10/100Mbps Fast Ethernet PHY
2009-01-16T05:48:00.000Z	sidney		how do i setup networking
2009-01-16T05:48:00.000Z	runderwo	sidney	it should be automatic, if the chip is enabled.
2009-01-16T05:48:00.000Z	runderwo	sidney	when you lspci, does it show up?
2009-01-16T05:50:00.000Z	sidney	runderwo	it shows up
2009-01-16T05:51:00.000Z	runderwo	sidney	what does ifconfig eth0 show?
2009-01-16T05:52:00.000Z	sidney	runderwo	http://paste.ubuntu.com/105381/
2009-01-16T05:55:00.000Z	runderwo	sidney	it looks like it is working.
2009-01-16T05:55:00.000Z	sidney	runderwo	i see the other computer but no files
2009-01-16T05:56:00.000Z	runderwo	sidney	so you're trying to share files with windows?
2009-01-16T06:03:00.000Z	runderwo	sidney	so you're trying to use the machine with the VIA chip as a file server?
2009-01-16T06:04:00.000Z	sidney	runderwo	i just want it tobe part of my home network
2009-01-16T06:05:00.000Z	runderwo	sidney	have you installed samba?
2009-01-16T06:06:00.000Z	sidney	runderwo	i think it is installed this is super ubuntu
2009-01-16T06:06:00.000Z	sidney	runderwo	i can see even windows machines
2009-01-16T06:07:00.000Z	runderwo	sidney	then you need to read about configuring samba.  The network is working, but the server has to be set up and told what shares to make available and who has permission to view them.
