2005-05-24T08:11:00.000Z	daniels	lexxan	go easy on both the language and abuse.  final warning.
2005-05-24T08:11:00.000Z	lexxan	daniels	I don't like you.
2005-05-24T08:12:00.000Z	daniels	lexxan	that's good; leave the attitude at the door, and focus on helping users, ok?
2005-05-24T08:13:00.000Z	lexxan	daniels	So when are you geniuses in the office gonna make an irc bot?
2005-05-24T08:14:00.000Z	daniels	lexxan	undecided, but if there is one, its content would have to be pretty carefully monitored.  bots like that have a long history of being filled with staggeringly bad advice.
2005-05-24T08:15:00.000Z	daniels	lexxan	also, 'in the office', as it were, we're busy doing trivial things like moving to gcc4 and replacing chunks of the X source tree
2005-05-24T08:17:00.000Z	daniels	lexxan	hate to break it to you, but we all work from home.
2005-05-24T08:19:00.000Z	lexxan	daniels	So do you at least get a bonus for living on irc?
