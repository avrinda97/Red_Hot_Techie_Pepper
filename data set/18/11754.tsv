2008-03-18T08:46:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	shawn__	what file are you trying to edit and what directory are you trytin to save it in and what error are you getting
2008-03-18T08:47:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	shawn__	your xorg.conf file ?
2008-03-18T08:47:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	shawn__	that requires sudo nano.,. as I said earlier/
2008-03-18T08:48:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	shawn__	one sec
2008-03-18T08:48:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	shawn__	write this down   sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg or sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg (to just set res) If you get locked out Select vesa as your video card and 1024 max rex.  Use tab or enter to accept all other defaults
2008-03-18T08:50:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	shawn__	If you want someone to look over your xorg.conf       sudo apt-get install pastebinit  && cat /etc/X11/xorg.conf | pastebinit (Provide Pastebin link in channel)
2008-03-18T09:01:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	shawn__	So that got you in right
2008-03-18T09:35:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	shawn__	What video card are you running
2008-03-18T09:42:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	shawn__	sudo apt-get install xorg-driver-fglrx       then       sudo apt-get install xserver-xgl
2008-03-18T09:42:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	shawn__	read that link I gave tritium and edit your xorg accordingly
2008-03-18T09:44:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	shawn__	gksudo edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf    hint.. it is also in those notes
