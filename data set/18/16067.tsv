2005-06-20T09:44:00.000Z	WebMaven		who do I talk to?
2005-06-20T09:45:00.000Z	bob2	WebMaven	edit the repository list so you're not using us.archive.ubuntu.com
2005-06-20T09:47:00.000Z	WebMaven	bob2	what should it use?
2005-06-20T09:47:00.000Z	bob2	WebMaven	just archive.ubnutu.com (us. is screwed atm)
2005-06-20T10:01:00.000Z	WebMaven	bob2	thank you, that fixed it.
2005-06-20T10:01:00.000Z	bob2	WebMaven	cool
2005-06-20T10:01:00.000Z	WebMaven	bob2	what exactly is wrong with us.archive.ubuntu.com, anyway?
2005-06-20T10:02:00.000Z	bob2	WebMaven	I don't know.  it's not just out of date, things are actually corrupt...maybe their disk is failing or something.
2005-06-20T10:02:00.000Z	WebMaven	bob2	how long has this been a problem?
2005-06-20T10:03:00.000Z	bob2	WebMaven	a few days now.  I take it someone has contact the admins of tha, and the ubuntu.com admins have been contacted, too
2005-06-20T10:04:00.000Z	WebMaven	bob2	OK, good. Is there an ETA for a fix, or should I just keep using archive.ubuntu.com permanently?
2005-06-20T10:05:00.000Z	bob2	WebMaven	I don't know, sorry
2005-06-20T10:05:00.000Z	WebMaven	bob2	OK. Is there a page on the ubuntu.org site with a notice?
2005-06-20T10:05:00.000Z	bob2	WebMaven	not that I know of
2005-06-20T10:06:00.000Z	WebMaven	bob2	OK, I'll just check back here in the channel in a few days, then.
