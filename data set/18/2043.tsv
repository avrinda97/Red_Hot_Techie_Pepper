2011-08-05T03:44:00.000Z	Datz		Hi, do I have to set up a user for ftp or will already added users automatically be able to use ftp with their accounts?
2011-08-05T03:46:00.000Z	glebihan	Datz	system users should have access to ftp unless the configuration of the server restricts their access
2011-08-05T03:47:00.000Z	Datz	glebihan	thanks
2011-08-05T03:47:00.000Z	glebihan	Datz	you're welcome
2011-08-05T03:58:00.000Z	Datz	glebihan	I was asking about ftp accounts earlier
2011-08-21T05:16:00.000Z	glebihan	Datz	the
2011-08-21T05:16:00.000Z	glebihan	Datz	there is no tool to do that
2011-08-21T05:17:00.000Z	Datz	glebihan	that seems odd
2011-08-21T05:17:00.000Z	glebihan	Datz	if you want to disable some services you have to manually edit the scripts in /etc/init
2011-08-21T05:17:00.000Z	Datz	glebihan	ok, that's what I thought
2011-08-21T05:20:00.000Z	Datz	glebihan	so if I don't want a service to run, I can move the file in /etc/init.d/ elsewhere?
2011-08-21T05:20:00.000Z	glebihan	Datz	no
2011-08-21T05:20:00.000Z	glebihan	Datz	first it's not /etc/init.d but /etc/init
2011-08-21T05:20:00.000Z	glebihan	Datz	and you shouldn't remove them
2011-08-21T05:21:00.000Z	glebihan	Datz	I would rather comment out the "start on...." line
2011-08-21T05:23:00.000Z	glebihan	Datz	I misread you, thought you wanted to delete the script
2011-10-14T09:54:00.000Z	glebihan	Datz	you can use gnome-fallback-session + gnome-panel
2011-10-14T09:55:00.000Z	Datz	glebihan	thanks. It's either that or have to go with debian for awhile. :-/
