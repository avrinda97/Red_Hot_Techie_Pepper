2010-10-06T03:25:00.000Z	cablop		how can i mount a dm-crypt partition and then mount the lvm inside it?
2010-10-06T03:26:00.000Z	cablop		i need to recover files from an existing system in a different computer
2010-10-06T03:26:00.000Z	cablop		but the filesystem is encrypted, we have the password, but we don't know how to open the dm-crypt
2010-10-06T03:28:00.000Z	ejv	cablop	i think you're a bit confused, but here's what I think you're asking for: sudo cryptsetup <options> create <mapper-name> /dev/lvm-block
2010-10-06T03:28:00.000Z	ejv	cablop	then sudo mount /dev/mapper/<mapper-name> /mountpoint
2010-10-06T03:28:00.000Z	cablop	ejv	mmm why confused?
2010-10-06T03:28:00.000Z	ejv	cablop	the way you asked the question sounds just weird to me
2010-10-06T03:29:00.000Z	cablop	ejv	thanks then cryptsetup will open the existing encrypted filesystem for me?
2010-10-06T03:29:00.000Z	ejv	cablop	you'll know very quickly if it worked or not, when you try to mount it
2010-10-06T03:29:00.000Z	ejv	cablop	try it ;)
2010-10-06T03:30:00.000Z	cablop	ejv	it seems it creates the system, not open it... the setup in the name just scares me a bit
2010-10-06T03:31:00.000Z	ejv	cablop	as long as you don't mkfs on the LVM, you can try an infinite amount of combinations
2010-10-06T03:31:00.000Z	cablop	ejv	so i can use it to open and recover those files, isn't it?
2010-10-06T03:32:00.000Z	ejv	cablop	that's the idea, first you need to decrypt it properly and mount it
2010-10-06T03:33:00.000Z	ejv	cablop	if you used a nonstandard cipher, offsets, skip sector, initiliazation vector, luks, etc. you NEED to specify those.
2010-10-06T03:35:00.000Z	cablop	ejv	it seems that cryptsetup luksOpen dm-crypt_partition dev_mapper  would work...
2010-10-06T03:48:00.000Z	cablop	ejv	  i think it is something like this http://blog.gnu-designs.com/solved-howto-mount-an-external-encrypted-luks-volume-under-linux with some variants
2010-10-06T03:48:00.000Z	cablop	ejv	thanks for your help
