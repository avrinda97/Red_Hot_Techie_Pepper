2006-10-27T08:26:00.000Z	goose	sproingie	that didn't help :|  i don't have a .fonts.conf
2006-10-27T08:27:00.000Z	sproingie	goose	try creating the one at the bottom of the bug report
2006-10-27T08:27:00.000Z	sproingie	goose	you also have to restart X of course
2006-10-27T08:28:00.000Z	goose	sproingie	isn't there an fc-cache command ?
2006-10-27T08:28:00.000Z	sproingie	goose	beats me, i've always had to restart x to make it work
2006-10-27T08:28:00.000Z	goose	sproingie	ok i'll test it out and get back to  you
2006-10-27T08:34:00.000Z	goose	sproingie	yea it's better =)
2006-10-27T08:34:00.000Z	sproingie	goose	ok, so it actually needs a new font conf file, not just removing it
2006-10-27T08:34:00.000Z	goose	sproingie	it's not as nice as it used to be though
2006-10-27T08:35:00.000Z	sproingie	goose	yeah i think it's one of the antialiasing modes are broken.  it's why it's a workaround, not a fix
2006-10-27T08:35:00.000Z	sproingie	goose	still, at least it's readable now
2006-10-27T08:35:00.000Z	goose	sproingie	i hope an update gets pushed in a week =)
2006-10-27T08:40:00.000Z	goose	sproingie	gaim2.0 also feels really really sluggish
2006-10-27T08:41:00.000Z	sproingie	goose	can't help there, i don't use gaim
2006-10-27T08:41:00.000Z	goose	sproingie	ah =)
