2008-12-15T01:26:00.000Z	rookeeeeeeeee	Gnea	i've already setup bluetooth. that is unhelpful im afraid.
2008-12-15T01:27:00.000Z	Gnea	rookeeeeeeeee	are you sure it's fully charged?
2008-12-15T01:27:00.000Z	rookeeeeeeeee	Gnea	yes, indeed it is
2008-12-15T01:29:00.000Z	Gnea	rookeeeeeeeee	does it get choppier the more you walk away from the computer?
2008-12-15T01:29:00.000Z	rookeeeeeeeee	Gnea	YES
2008-12-15T01:31:00.000Z	Gnea	rookeeeeeeeee	do you get any static while using it with your phone?
2008-12-15T01:32:00.000Z	Gnea	rookeeeeeeeee	I see... do you have a non-bt mouse?
2008-12-15T01:32:00.000Z	Gnea	rookeeeeeeeee	and what happens when you unplug your bt mouse? does the static go away or remain?
2008-12-15T01:33:00.000Z	Gnea	rookeeeeeeeee	okay
2008-12-15T01:41:00.000Z	Gnea	rookeeeeeeeee	replace the bluetooth mouse with a non-bluetooth mouse.
2008-12-15T01:42:00.000Z	Gnea	rookeeeeeeeee	mice are cheap - less than $5.
2008-12-15T01:45:00.000Z	Gnea	rookeeeeeeeee	well, the only channels that bluetooth uses are for different protocols, as outlined here: http://www.spiration.co.uk/post/1307/Ubuntu Linux - Bluetooth and GPRS dialup connection
2008-12-15T02:09:00.000Z	Gnea	rookeeeeeeeee	pardon?
2008-12-15T02:10:00.000Z	Gnea	rookeeeeeeeee	you miss the point entirely: you can't change the channel that the bluetooth devices communicate on.
2008-12-15T02:11:00.000Z	Gnea	rookeeeeeeeee	you need to eliminate one of your bluetooth devices.
2008-12-15T02:12:00.000Z	Gnea	rookeeeeeeeee	each channel is set aside for a special purpose. yes, it sucks, but mice are relatively cheap, especially for people who live in the US.
