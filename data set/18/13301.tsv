2006-07-20T11:01:00.000Z	lewbing		#ubuntu-cn can't help me,
2006-07-20T11:01:00.000Z	dli	lewbing	don't go to ubuntu-cn, ask your questions here
2006-07-20T11:02:00.000Z	dli	lewbing	you can not install to a livecd, can you install to your hard drive?
2006-07-20T11:07:00.000Z	dli	lewbing	okay, why are you making so many partitions?
2006-07-20T11:08:00.000Z	dli	lewbing	okay, booting problem? can you mount the partitions, and chroot to it
2006-07-20T11:08:00.000Z	dli	lewbing	if you are sure about the installation, and the problem is no more than booting, you can follow the grub howto
2006-07-20T11:09:00.000Z	dli	lewbing	first, I would think your disk is in a very bad shape, if it's not too late, I suggest you to re-install
2006-07-20T11:10:00.000Z	dli	lewbing	you have so many partitions, quite not reasonable sizes, and reiserfs is known to be unstable
2006-07-20T11:11:00.000Z	dli	lewbing	okay, do you know which partition is your / partition?
2006-07-20T11:11:00.000Z	dli	lewbing	if you have no idea, do: sudo grub
2006-07-20T11:11:00.000Z	dli	lewbing	that should lead you to the grub command line, then, do: find /etc/hosts
2006-07-20T11:13:00.000Z	dli	lewbing	read the grub howto, if you want to understand more
2006-07-20T11:15:00.000Z	dli	lewbing	I suggest you to reinstall, if /dev/hda1 is your / partition, it's too small (at 2GB), and you have the space
2006-07-20T11:15:00.000Z	dli	lewbing	find /etc/hosts should say (hd0,0)
2006-07-20T11:17:00.000Z	dli	lewbing	pm me
2006-07-20T11:17:00.000Z	dli	lewbing	what's your language?
