2006-04-29T09:36:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	Pmafia	you don't download random crap and run it.. that's the windows way of doing things.
2006-04-29T09:41:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	Pmafia	ubuntu devs will package it if it looks useful or people want it.. make sure it does what it says, sign the package so you know you're getting exactly what they packaged..
2006-04-29T09:42:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	Pmafia	there's almost nothing you'd want that isn't already in the repos.
2006-04-29T09:54:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	Pmafia	depends on the file..
2006-04-29T09:56:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	Pmafia	most linux stuff is distributed as source so it can be built on a variety of systems.. usually you untar it and find a textfile called README which tells you how to build it.
2006-04-29T10:02:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	Pmafia	I suggest you get familiar with what's already installed (about 1000 packages) and what's readily available in multiverse (about 17,000 packages) before you worry about stuff that isn't packaged..
2006-04-29T10:25:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	Pmafia	most of the time it's like windows.. just plug stuff in and ubuntu finds it..
