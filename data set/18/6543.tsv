2008-05-01T02:42:00.000Z	madmoomix		I wanted to switch off of my old distro, so, I installed 8.04. Everything went great. Burned a disc, installed, no issues anywhere. Restarted into my new install, everything was wonderful.
2008-05-01T02:43:00.000Z	madmoomix		Then, I updated everything through Synaptic. It told me I needed to restart. I did. GRUB stops being able to boot the kernal.
2008-05-01T02:44:00.000Z	madmoomix		I figure I've fubar'd GRUB, and it's a new install. So, I decide to re-install. Here's where it gets good.
2008-05-01T02:44:00.000Z	madmoomix		The live CD NO LONGER BOOTS THE UBUNTU KERNAL.
2008-05-01T02:44:00.000Z	madmoomix		But, the disc is 100%, and my computer is working fine.
2008-05-01T02:44:00.000Z	madmoomix		Because it boots other linux distros fine.
2008-05-01T02:46:00.000Z	madmoomix		XD
2008-05-01T02:46:00.000Z	madmoomix		No worries.
2008-05-01T02:46:00.000Z	madmoomix		It's assuredly the weirdest problem I've ever seen any distro have.
2008-05-01T02:48:00.000Z	madmoomix		So, anyone else? Somehow, a bad install of Ubuntu made my computer unable to boot the kernal on the live CD, despite functioning fine everywhere else.
2008-05-01T02:49:00.000Z	Gun_Smoke	madmoomix	It sounds like the CD is no good.  Have you tried to reburn it?
2008-05-01T02:49:00.000Z	Gun_Smoke	madmoomix	errr.. burn another..
2008-05-01T02:49:00.000Z	madmoomix	Gun_Smoke	yes. And every time, I check it. Always comes out fine.
2008-05-01T02:52:00.000Z	Gun_Smoke	madmoomix	So the install bombed and now you can't load the kernel image from a live CD correc
2008-05-01T02:52:00.000Z	madmoomix	Gun_Smoke	that is correct.
2008-05-01T02:52:00.000Z	Gun_Smoke	madmoomix	Have you tried the alternateCD?
2008-05-01T02:53:00.000Z	madmoomix	Gun_Smoke	no. I shall try that now, as it seems this place is busy, and I want to get out of your hair XD
2008-05-01T02:54:00.000Z	Gun_Smoke	madmoomix	Thats a good idea..  The alternateCD will 95% work just fine for you.
