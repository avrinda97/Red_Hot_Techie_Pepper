2005-07-23T09:56:00.000Z	nickrud		If I hadn't sworn off programming, this little thing might actually make me want to learn python
2005-07-23T09:57:00.000Z	nickrud		I can actually read it
2005-07-23T09:58:00.000Z	kevin	nickrud	I sore off of programming for one reason; I didn't start using pc's till 5 years ago
2005-07-23T09:59:00.000Z	nickrud	kevin	lol, I stopped programming nearly 20 years ago
2005-07-23T10:00:00.000Z	kevin	nickrud	if I had the understanding of even one program fro programming I might give it a shot but.... you know... dislexia and programming don't mix and match too well
2005-07-23T10:02:00.000Z	nickrud	kevin	I hear you
2005-07-23T10:03:00.000Z	nickrud	kevin	better is sudo -s
2005-07-23T10:06:00.000Z	nickrud	kevin	this time I was right, but, look at my advice thru a lens :)
2005-07-23T10:09:00.000Z	kevin	nickrud	me thinks me wife is ready for bed, night and see you all tomorrow
2005-07-23T10:10:00.000Z	nickrud	kevin	good night
2006-05-28T08:42:00.000Z	kevin	nickrud	- you need the win32 codecs installed?
2006-05-28T13:25:00.000Z	nickrud	kevin	uscg_corey middle-click drag, easiest :)
2006-05-28T13:26:00.000Z	kevin	nickrud	- sweet shortcut. thanks
2006-05-28T14:12:00.000Z	kevin	nickrud	- mythtv will work on that.. but make sure you use tv card with hardware mpeg encoding - eg pvr-250, etc..
2006-05-28T14:13:00.000Z	nickrud	kevin	thanks. I know it's slow, and was about to start looking for an adequate card. Thanks for the pointer
2006-05-28T14:14:00.000Z	kevin	nickrud	- yes, it should be fine - i've got mythtv on a via epia mobo - 600MHz C3 processor... fine and dandy.
2006-05-28T14:14:00.000Z	nickrud	kevin	I am reassured :)
2007-11-16T12:48:00.000Z	nickrud	kevin	no, it's probably because your window manager didn't get started, that's emerald
