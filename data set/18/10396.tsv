2006-12-20T09:12:00.000Z	cld2		anyone know why I would go from 1400 fps in glxgears with the open source ati drivers to 250 fps with the binary ati drivers? thanks.
2006-12-20T09:13:00.000Z	arrenlex	cld2	Because fglrx was coded in notepad by a blindfolded intern.
2006-12-20T09:32:00.000Z	arrenlex	cld2	Did that exchange also physically hurt you? Or is it just me?
2006-12-20T09:32:00.000Z	cld2	arrenlex	yeah, my back and head are a little melty I also gave him that same link at 7:19
2006-12-20T09:33:00.000Z	arrenlex	cld2	Yes, I remember !fglrx-ing him earlier as well.
2006-12-20T09:33:00.000Z	cld2	arrenlex	I need some hand holding for the gui ish things like bluetooth and such but I at least try to read what im being told. ;)
2006-12-20T09:37:00.000Z	arrenlex	cld2	At this point, isn't it actually easier to remove the 386 kernel?
2006-12-20T09:39:00.000Z	cld2	arrenlex	LineOf7s: just preference I always like having an 'old reliable' kernel to fall back on. but i think changing the default from 0 to 1 is easier then backing out an older kernel.
2006-12-20T09:40:00.000Z	arrenlex	cld2	When I upgrade to a newer kernel, I keep the old one until I am certain my machine boots and functions fine. Then I remove the old one.
2006-12-20T09:40:00.000Z	arrenlex	cld2	I have never had a problem with a kernel except one I compiled myself when I was a n00b and had no idea when I was doing.
2006-12-20T09:40:00.000Z	cld2	arrenlex	so you only run with one kernel in /boot after you are done testing?
2006-12-20T09:40:00.000Z	arrenlex	cld2	Yes, I have only one kernel on my machine.
2006-12-20T09:41:00.000Z	arrenlex	cld2	Like neither what has what, sorry?
2006-12-20T09:41:00.000Z	cld2	arrenlex	I guess I need to drop my gentoo ish ways. im used to having shit just hit the fan in a major way and an older working kernel is nice to have.
2006-12-20T09:41:00.000Z	arrenlex	cld2	Ah, gentoo. That explains you.
2006-12-20T09:42:00.000Z	cld2	arrenlex	oh telling seamus7 that you regularly remove your old kernels with no problems
2006-12-20T09:42:00.000Z	arrenlex	cld2	Is that bad? xD
2006-12-20T09:46:00.000Z	cld2	arrenlex	I have that url in my clipboard still
