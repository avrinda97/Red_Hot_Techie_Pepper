2006-12-12T16:16:00.000Z	pike_	Chucknorrislol	try "sudo apt-get install linux-restricted-modules-`uname -r`" if you havent already
2006-12-12T16:16:00.000Z	Chucknorrislol		it says 'no wireless extensions' for lo, eth0 and sit0
2006-12-12T16:17:00.000Z	Chucknorrislol		pike: what does that do?
2006-12-12T16:17:00.000Z	pike_	Chucknorrislol	installs linux restricted package for your kernel another way is sudo apt-get isntall linux-restricted-modules-$(uname -r)
2006-12-12T16:18:00.000Z	Chucknorrislol	dfwlinuxguy	ok, how do i do that?
2006-12-12T16:18:00.000Z	pike_	Chucknorrislol	 the `` or $() designate a terminal command the `` are not quotes but tildes i think theyre called
2006-12-12T16:19:00.000Z	Chucknorrislol		it seems like my card is unrecognized so far... nothing i run says it recognizes my card
2006-12-12T16:19:00.000Z	Chucknorrislol		i'm doing that right now ^_^
2006-12-12T16:20:00.000Z	Chucknorrislol		ah... i'm not sure
2006-12-12T16:20:00.000Z	Chucknorrislol		i've heard stuff about madwifi
2006-12-12T16:21:00.000Z	Chucknorrislol		i tried wrapping the windows XP driver that came on my card's installation CD... it said it was invalid
2006-12-12T16:21:00.000Z	Chucknorrislol		pike: package installed
2006-12-12T16:22:00.000Z	pike_	Chucknorrislol	might be all you need to do.  reboot might be easiest thing now
