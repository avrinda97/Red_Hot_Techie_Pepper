2005-10-06T15:26:00.000Z	TiMiDo	ccooke	can i still see the windows partition on kde
2005-10-06T15:27:00.000Z	ccooke	TiMiDo	okay. In Konqueror, try going to /media
2005-10-06T15:27:00.000Z	ccooke	TiMiDo	what do you see there?
2005-10-06T15:29:00.000Z	ccooke	TiMiDo	okay. can you get a konsole up?
2005-10-06T15:29:00.000Z	ccooke	TiMiDo	type 'esd'
2005-10-06T15:29:00.000Z	ccooke	TiMiDo	what happens?
2005-10-06T15:31:00.000Z	ccooke	TiMiDo	okay, so esd is running as root.
2005-10-06T15:31:00.000Z	ccooke	TiMiDo	which it shouldn't be.
2005-10-06T15:31:00.000Z	ccooke	TiMiDo	sudo killall esd
2005-10-06T15:31:00.000Z	ccooke	TiMiDo	it should run as the user who needs it.
2005-10-06T15:34:00.000Z	ccooke	TiMiDo	now, as a normal user - *not* as root - run esd
2005-10-06T15:34:00.000Z	ccooke	TiMiDo	you've run it? right.
2005-10-06T15:34:00.000Z	ccooke	TiMiDo	can you start an mp3 playing?
2005-10-06T15:34:00.000Z	ccooke	TiMiDo	so we can tell when you *get* sound
2005-10-06T15:35:00.000Z	ccooke	TiMiDo	set it to repeat
2005-10-06T15:35:00.000Z	ccooke	TiMiDo	well, no. you can't get sound. you've mentioned this. So not hearing anything is expected, currently...
2005-10-06T15:35:00.000Z	ccooke	TiMiDo	however, if something is playing, then we'll know when we do something *right*
2005-10-06T15:37:00.000Z	ccooke	TiMiDo	the most likely cause is your volume being muted
