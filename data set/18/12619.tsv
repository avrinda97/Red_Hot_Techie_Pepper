2006-03-25T12:09:00.000Z	jacopoexchange		does anyone know how to install a realtek alc850 on ubuntu?
2006-03-25T12:10:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	jacopoexchange	what is it? sound card?
2006-03-25T12:11:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	jacopoexchange	it didn't detect it on startup? check dmesg and the output of cat /proc/pci
2006-09-05T06:28:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	jacopoexchange	what do you mean 'how'?
2006-09-05T06:29:00.000Z	jacopoexchange	fyrestrtr	i need to be able to access as non-root an ext3 partition
2006-09-05T06:29:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	jacopoexchange	you have a few options -- change the umask, or set it so normal users can mount it.
2006-09-05T06:30:00.000Z	jacopoexchange	fyrestrtr	no, just a data partition i made
2006-09-05T06:30:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	jacopoexchange	mount it with umask=000 that should help.
2006-09-05T06:34:00.000Z	jacopoexchange	fyrestrtr	, Jack_Sparrow: i tried with umask=000, but still doesn't allow non-root to write. options are auto,rw,umask=000 right now
2006-09-05T06:35:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	jacopoexchange	what are the permissions on the files in that device?
2006-09-05T06:37:00.000Z	jacopoexchange	fyrestrtr	Jack_Sparrow: can't write for both "user" and "others"
2006-09-05T06:40:00.000Z	jacopoexchange	fyrestrtr	Jack_Sparrow: this morning i also tried to manyally allow write for everybody, but that would only work for first level, meaning all subfolders still would have write denied
2006-09-05T06:55:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	jacopoexchange	chmod -R 777 /mount/ <-- one way to solve your problem
2006-09-05T06:57:00.000Z	jacopoexchange	fyrestrtr	that didn't work
2006-09-05T06:58:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	jacopoexchange	what do you mean it didn't work? did it change the permissions? did you run the command as sudo?
2006-09-05T06:59:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	jacopoexchange	pastebin the output of 'mount' and the output of ls -l your mount point.
2006-09-05T07:04:00.000Z	jacopoexchange	fyrestrtr	 http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/22616
2006-09-05T07:05:00.000Z	jacopoexchange	fyrestrtr	now that i changed chmod of the mount point, all the subdirectories are still read-only
