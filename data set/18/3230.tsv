2010-02-18T00:26:00.000Z	richthegeek		hi guys! My Linksys WUSB6000N keeps dropping out and then reconnecting every hour or so - anyway i can diagnose the issue?
2010-02-18T00:27:00.000Z	rotten777	richthegeek	which encryption is the wireless set at?
2010-02-18T00:27:00.000Z	richthegeek	rotten777	wpa2-psk
2010-02-18T00:27:00.000Z	richthegeek	rotten777	no, can't
2010-02-18T00:27:00.000Z	richthegeek	rotten777	I have no access to changing the security on the router
2010-02-18T00:27:00.000Z	rotten777	richthegeek	for troubleshooting even? ahh
2010-02-18T00:27:00.000Z	rotten777	richthegeek	well I don't know I never found a fix for it
2010-02-18T00:28:00.000Z	richthegeek	rotten777	right
2010-02-18T00:34:00.000Z	rotten777	richthegeek	i never found a workaround with the atheros chipset I'm stuck with, i did change the encryption scheme which tells me it's the handling of wpa
2010-02-18T00:34:00.000Z	richthegeek	rotten777	k
2010-02-18T00:39:00.000Z	richthegeek	rotten777	WEP is insecure, and it's likely that the problem was isolated to your driver/chipset, so won't solve most other people's issues
2010-02-18T00:40:00.000Z	rotten777	richthegeek	it's a very common problem. and yes wep is insecure but wpa isn't the holy grail of encryption and can itself be hacked.
2010-02-18T00:40:00.000Z	richthegeek	rotten777	a *lot* slower
2010-02-18T00:40:00.000Z	richthegeek	rotten777	and a heck of a lot harder
2010-02-18T00:41:00.000Z	rotten777	richthegeek	well either a stable mildly insecure wireless or an unstable somewhat more secure wireless
2010-02-18T00:41:00.000Z	rotten777	richthegeek	it isn't THAT difficult with distributed computing
2010-02-18T00:42:00.000Z	richthegeek	rotten777	yes it is, it's a difference between 3.4x10^38 and 1.34x10^154
2010-02-18T00:43:00.000Z	richthegeek	rotten777	or a factor pf 3.9x10^115 more difficult to crack
