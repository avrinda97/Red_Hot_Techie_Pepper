2011-05-05T19:31:00.000Z	jamiewhite		windows key
2011-05-05T19:31:00.000Z	jamiewhite		or install synapse
2011-05-05T19:32:00.000Z	jamiewhite		or install gnome-shell just break unity
2011-05-05T19:33:00.000Z	jamiewhite		because he's using Unity and Unity makes you want to break things
2011-05-05T19:34:00.000Z	jamiewhite		lmao
2011-05-05T19:34:00.000Z	jamiewhite		QUITTER!
2011-05-05T19:34:00.000Z	jo-erlend	jamiewhite	Unity is by far the best shell I've ever come across. Others might not like it, and still others dislike it just because it's different. People are different. Choice is good.
2011-05-05T19:35:00.000Z	jamiewhite	jo-erlend	yeah choice is good.... thats why they gave us a choice between old classic or breaking unity with gnome shell. what a wealth of chioces.
2011-05-05T19:37:00.000Z	jo-erlend	jamiewhite	gnome-panel, Unity, xfce4-panel, lxpanel... Those are just some. I know there are at least ten other good ones in the repos. It's true that gnome 3 was released only a few weeks before Ubuntu and therefore couldn't be used in this release, but it will be available in the next ones.
2011-05-05T19:39:00.000Z	jamiewhite	jo-erlend	Gnome-shell is pretty darn good though. I find unity far too buggy and overwhelming. A lot of people have issues with it. I love my gnome classic so I'm ok. But i wish instead of wasting time on making Unity, Canonical might have spent time on better printer support, wine integration and other stuff like apple products.
2011-05-05T19:41:00.000Z	jo-erlend	jamiewhite	I completely disagree. Gnome Shell lacks lots of stuff that Unity has. They're different. And both will be available in 11.10.
2011-05-05T19:41:00.000Z	jamiewhite	jo-erlend	like what?
2011-05-05T19:42:00.000Z	jo-erlend	jamiewhite	zeitgeist, for instance.
2011-05-05T19:44:00.000Z	jamiewhite	jo-erlend	and zeitgeist works great atm yeah? I'm a coder and artist, so come back to me when Unity has window managment like Gnome-shells
2011-05-05T19:45:00.000Z	jo-erlend	jamiewhite	this is offtopic. I have no intention of discussing if program A is better than program B here. This is a help channel. Join #Ubuntu-offtopic to chat.
