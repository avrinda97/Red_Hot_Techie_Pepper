2009-11-10T19:24:00.000Z	bidossessi	mbeierl	that's been changed a while ago. now everything's just sdX
2009-11-10T19:26:00.000Z	bidossessi	mbeierl	pretty useful, themm uuid buggers, even though they can be a hand(type)ful
2009-11-10T19:36:00.000Z	mbeierl	bidossessi	he's modified the partition table of his /home - he's going to need to recover his data before trying anything more...
2009-11-10T19:37:00.000Z	bidossessi	mbeierl	for now, i believe fstab hasn't been touched yet, so it's possible.
2009-11-10T19:48:00.000Z	bidossessi	mbeierl	you don't want to go the uuid route? future-proof
2009-11-10T19:48:00.000Z	mbeierl	bidossessi	I think using gparted will give him uuid, no?
2009-11-10T19:49:00.000Z	mbeierl	bidossessi	no, wait - it won't add the /etc/fstab for him...
2009-11-10T19:50:00.000Z	bidossessi	mbeierl	nope :(
2009-11-10T19:58:00.000Z	mbeierl	bidossessi	uuid for fstab, sure, but you cannot use anything other than /dev/sdX for partitioning, no?  Is there a better way?
2009-11-10T20:02:00.000Z	mbeierl	bidossessi	I think he's got the uuid ok in his fstab for the other partitions.  this is for adding a new HD to the system.  without knowing the /dev/sdX of the drive, it can't be formatted, therefore no uuid yet, right?  chicken-and-egg problem?
2009-11-10T20:03:00.000Z	bidossessi	mbeierl	so you see, no partitioning needed
2009-11-10T20:04:00.000Z	mbeierl	bidossessi	sorry to belabour the point, but does blkid work before the partition table is created on a new disk?
2009-11-10T20:04:00.000Z	bidossessi	mbeierl	have you tried it?
2009-11-10T20:04:00.000Z	mbeierl	bidossessi	I don't have a new disk :(
2009-11-10T20:06:00.000Z	bidossessi	mbeierl	right now, valentina has all her drives installed, so running blkid will give all availble uuids. the next step is writing them down, removeing the new hdd to get back to the old configuration, checking for differences, then updating fstab with the harvested uuids. once that is done, inserting a new drive will be harmless
2009-11-10T20:07:00.000Z	mbeierl	bidossessi	ok.  I joined in late so did not know that the fstab was manually changed to /dev/sdX format
2009-11-10T20:09:00.000Z	mbeierl	bidossessi	I am confused now.  The new drive does not show the new drive in blkid?
2009-11-10T20:09:00.000Z	mbeierl	bidossessi	ok, thanks!
