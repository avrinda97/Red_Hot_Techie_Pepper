2005-05-16T06:07:00.000Z	aleitner_		does anybody know how i can add handlers for custom protocols in gnome?
2005-05-16T06:07:00.000Z	aleitner_		 /usr/share/services/ seems to not influence gnome apps
2005-05-16T06:09:00.000Z	thoreauputic	aleitner_	I think you need to use the gconf editor
2005-05-16T06:10:00.000Z	thoreauputic	aleitner_	you might need to add a protocol there - I forget the exact place
2005-05-16T06:10:00.000Z	aleitner_	thoreauputic	i see. will search
2005-05-16T06:14:00.000Z	aleitner_	thoreauputic	there is indeed something (/desktop/url-handlers ) but neither firefox nor epiphany seem to care about those entries ...
2005-05-16T06:14:00.000Z	thoreauputic	aleitner_	hmm.. unfortunately I forget which section I had to edit
2005-05-16T06:15:00.000Z	aleitner_	thoreauputic	but it was in gconf?
2005-05-16T06:15:00.000Z	thoreauputic	aleitner_	yes, but this was a long time ago on gnome 2.4 I think
2005-05-16T06:15:00.000Z	thoreauputic	aleitner_	I'm sure it's doable though
2005-05-16T06:16:00.000Z	aleitner_	thoreauputic	ohh. ok, on 2.4 i could do it too (;
2005-05-16T06:16:00.000Z	aleitner_	thoreauputic	iirc there was even control-center support for it then. but in 2.10 that seems to be all gone
2005-05-16T06:16:00.000Z	thoreauputic	aleitner_	which protocol ?
2005-05-16T06:16:00.000Z	aleitner_	thoreauputic	ed2k (;
2005-05-16T06:16:00.000Z	thoreauputic	aleitner_	yes, in some ways gm=nome is going backwards
2005-05-16T06:17:00.000Z	aleitner_	thoreauputic	overall i am pretty pleased. its a huge project. i guess some regressions are unavoidable
2005-05-16T06:24:00.000Z	aleitner_	thoreauputic	got it. needs to be entered via about:config in either firefox or epiphany
2005-05-16T06:24:00.000Z	thoreauputic	aleitner_	aha !
