2008-03-22T04:31:00.000Z	Apac		Anyone here familiar with setting up a pptp connection in Kubuntu?
2008-03-22T04:32:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Apac	ask questions, don't ask to ask
2008-03-22T04:33:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Apac	are you doing peerdns or something?
2008-03-22T04:34:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Apac	like i asked before, are you using peerdns or anything?
2008-03-22T04:35:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Apac	and do you have the right static route set up to whatever network you are connecting to
2008-03-22T04:36:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Apac	and where are the resolvers located physically?
2008-03-22T04:36:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Apac	on your network segment or the network segment that you are connecting to
2008-03-22T04:36:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Apac	ok, and do you have the proper static route set up?
2008-03-22T04:37:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Apac	you need static route set up to route to the new network
2008-03-22T04:38:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Apac	i mean basic cross segment networking.
2008-03-22T04:38:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Apac	a static route that maps the IPs of the network segment you are connecting to to your local segment
2008-03-22T04:39:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Apac	probably not
2008-03-22T04:40:00.000Z	Apac	Fryguy--	well, in short, it changes my resolvers to the resolvers they should be, I can see the change when I cat /etc/resolv.conf
2008-03-22T04:40:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Apac	ok, so now add a static route so that the IPs that those resolves give you route to meaningful locations
2008-03-22T04:41:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Apac	yes
2008-03-22T04:41:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Apac	if you have dns, a pptp connection, and a route, then your connection works unless there are some extra limits/needs of your connection that are more than usual, and that is even more outside of the scope of this channel than this conversation already is
2008-03-22T04:42:00.000Z	Fryguy--	Apac	if you are routing to ltsp on windows or something you'll probably need to enable windows specific options.  Covered in pretty much every pptp tutorial i've ever seen
2008-03-22T05:54:00.000Z	Apac	Fryguy--	 I got it fixed.
