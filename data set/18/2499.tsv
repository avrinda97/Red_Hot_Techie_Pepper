2010-05-06T09:56:00.000Z	acerimmer	Chookie	you CAN choose not to install grub , you know.  it's an advanced option just before disk writing begins
2010-05-06T09:57:00.000Z	acerimmer	Chookie	yes?
2010-05-06T09:58:00.000Z	acerimmer	Chookie	go direct chat.  I just sent you the invite
2010-05-06T10:00:00.000Z	acerimmer	Chookie	ok, during install, after you've set up your partitions, selected user account names and your time zone, JUST BEFORE things start writing, you get a final screen showing what you've selected.  IN the lower right of the screen is "advanced options"  Within that is a go/no go install bootloader or select WHERE bootloader goes.  DON'T install bootloader if you don't want it.  HOWEVER<...
2010-05-06T10:02:00.000Z	acerimmer	Chookie	wt?  OK, but I KNOW you have bootloaer options in a text install including the option to NOT install a loader.
2010-05-06T10:03:00.000Z	acerimmer	Chookie	me: NOT  a ps3 hacker.
