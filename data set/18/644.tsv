2011-11-15T03:35:00.000Z	[dlp]		packagekitd is consuming far too much CPU time for my liking.
2011-11-15T03:35:00.000Z	[dlp]		Does anyone know how where it's generally invoked from?
2011-11-15T03:36:00.000Z	[dlp]		Ideally I want to change its schedule.
2011-11-15T03:37:00.000Z	[dlp]		I'm running Kubuntu, incidentally.
2011-11-15T03:37:00.000Z	[dlp]		I don't know yet if it's KDE that kicks it off.
2011-11-15T03:37:00.000Z	jbrks	[dlp]	well maybe ya goota kick it in really hard!! :)
2011-11-15T03:39:00.000Z	jbrks	[dlp]	i thought u can remove packagekit
2011-11-15T03:39:00.000Z	jbrks	[dlp]	uninstall it
2011-11-15T03:40:00.000Z	jbrks	[dlp]	well you can update the system other ways..
2011-11-15T03:41:00.000Z	jbrks	[dlp]	i don't know about "auto" updating.. and i don't think that's a good idea either..
2011-11-15T03:41:00.000Z	jbrks	[dlp]	btw.. packagekit i think is in debian as well..
2011-11-15T03:41:00.000Z	jbrks	[dlp]	apt/dpkg cli are still used even in 11.10 despite there's UbuntuCenterOne..
2011-11-15T03:42:00.000Z	jbrks	[dlp]	the cli still reflects <->UBCenterone
2011-11-15T03:42:00.000Z	jbrks	[dlp]	so you're in safe ground if you want to use the cli tools
2011-11-15T03:45:00.000Z	jbrks	[dlp]	it's tought to kill that thing.. JUST uninstall it.
2011-11-15T03:48:00.000Z	jbrks	[dlp]	i believe it's a new trend for support dbus..
2011-11-15T03:48:00.000Z	jbrks	[dlp]	problem when i was checking it out a year ago.. it was not possible to turn off it's notifications
2011-11-15T03:49:00.000Z	jbrks	[dlp]	i think it's supposed to be a distribution-neutral thing for future linuxes..
