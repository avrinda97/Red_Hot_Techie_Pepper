2009-05-27T09:05:00.000Z	SectorX4		Anyone free to help enlighten me? :P
2009-05-27T09:05:00.000Z	ed_debian	SectorX4	On what?
2009-05-27T09:05:00.000Z	SectorX4	ed_debian	apt-get is showing a mysql version of 5.0.6.7 but the Ubuntu website is showing current version as 5.0.7.5 and I'm not sure what im doing wrong =/
2009-05-27T09:06:00.000Z	ed_debian	SectorX4	Go to your system -> preferences -> software sources
2009-05-27T09:06:00.000Z	SectorX4	ed_debian	I'm running it on a headless box
2009-05-27T09:08:00.000Z	ed_debian	SectorX4	The sources list defines not only what repos but how new you want your packages to be
2009-05-27T09:09:00.000Z	ed_debian	SectorX4	That is my best guess yes.
2009-05-27T09:10:00.000Z	SectorX4	ed_debian	I have had a look at editing the sources list before..I came across a page on theUbuntu docs referring to a security source list which preferred security over stability
2009-05-27T09:10:00.000Z	ed_debian	SectorX4	BTW just because 5.7.whatever is out doesn't mean it's better or that the ubuntu developers think it's ready for ubuntu.  they might not offer it
2009-05-27T09:10:00.000Z	SectorX4	ed_debian	yeah I figure there's a reason it's at that version
2009-05-27T09:11:00.000Z	ed_debian	SectorX4	I can't remember the gui off the top of my head but I know you can select "security updates only", "backports", and 1 or 2 others
2009-05-27T09:12:00.000Z	SectorX4	ed_debian	yeah I did read a few pages in regards to how the gui works to try and figure it out
2009-05-27T09:13:00.000Z	ed_debian	SectorX4	How much do you trust the ubuntu developers?
2009-05-27T09:13:00.000Z	SectorX4	ed_debian	Ah ok, can't see anything under https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Repositories/CommandLine regardin g release-security
2009-05-27T09:14:00.000Z	SectorX4	ed_debian	hmmm I dunno...I see what you're saying though
2009-05-27T09:14:00.000Z	ed_debian	SectorX4	Yeah if the gui can do it then certainly sources.list can do it
2009-05-27T09:15:00.000Z	SectorX4	ed_debian	what do you think...about switching to release-security as opposed to how it is by default?
2009-05-27T09:16:00.000Z	ed_debian	SectorX4	back when I ran ubuntu I was on release updates (which includes all the security) this page is a little misleading (the gui is less so).  Each of the option as you go down include all the packages from the previous as well
