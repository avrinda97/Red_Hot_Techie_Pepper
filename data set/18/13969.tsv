2005-11-01T10:25:00.000Z	coolkev		I have a very big complain, and i have complained before as well, but was unable to get a response then, if i can't get a response in the channel i would like to know from who or where. The question is as follows: Every since switching from Hoary to Breezy, certain application seem to close on their own, a very important application to me which i know for a fact closesly randomly, becasue of ubuntu breezy is xcha
2005-11-01T10:25:00.000Z	coolkev		t, i have lost many hours of works and filequeues because my xchat closes because breezy has porblems
2005-11-01T10:26:00.000Z	_jason	coolkev	 I have experienced the same thing with xchat a few times.  I am now running it in a terminal to see if I can find an error message, but it has yet to crash.
2005-11-01T10:29:00.000Z	_jason	coolkev	 I have only noticed this behavior with xchat, what other programs crashed for you?
2005-11-01T10:30:00.000Z	coolkev	_jason	if i leave firefox running, i wake up firefox is no longer running, and Xchat is not running as usual, sometimes xchat closes in front of my eyes, and i just feel like stomping on which ever idiot that made the error int he ubuntu code, i tried with the ubuntu repop, xchat 2.4.4 and then complied my self xchat 2.4.5
2005-11-01T10:31:00.000Z	_jason	coolkev	 the one you compiled has not crashed I assume?
2005-11-01T10:36:00.000Z	coolkev	_jason	did you do a upgrade to breezy using the repositories, from hoary to breezy
2005-11-06T11:18:00.000Z	_jason	coolkev	 i had that problem, give me a sec and ill write up the fix
2005-11-06T11:20:00.000Z	_jason	coolkev	 back up your current gmd.conf and replace it with factory-gdm.conf... everything should be in /etc/gdm
2005-11-06T11:29:00.000Z	_jason	coolkev	 sudo cp gdm.conf gdm.conf.backup and then sudo cp factory-gdm.conf gdm.conf
2005-11-06T11:35:00.000Z	coolkev	_jason	did exactly as u mentined and didn't work
2005-11-06T11:35:00.000Z	_jason	coolkev	 still giving you an error about gdm.conf?
2005-11-06T11:35:00.000Z	_jason	coolkev	 link your gdm.conf again... and does the erro give you a line number?
2005-11-06T11:37:00.000Z	_jason	coolkev	 I assumed it was the same problem because I thought it said gdm.conf... it amy be a different file
2005-11-06T12:01:00.000Z	_jason	coolkev	 make sure you undo the factory replace and put back the backup
2005-11-06T12:12:00.000Z	_jason	coolkev	 glad you figured it out
2005-11-06T12:13:00.000Z	coolkev	_jason	when he gets back can to please let em know for me that i appreciated his help
2005-11-06T12:13:00.000Z	_jason	coolkev	 k
