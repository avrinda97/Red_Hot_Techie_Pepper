2008-06-23T02:22:00.000Z	Bllz		still no go in VLC
2008-06-23T02:23:00.000Z	Bllz		I still can't play avi in VLC...
2008-06-23T02:24:00.000Z	Bllz		my camera encodes as motion jpeg... is that the same as .AVI?
2008-06-23T02:25:00.000Z	Bllz		jewfro:  nice name =)  I got one of those too and i'm not even jewish...  how do I play a motion jpeg in ubuntu then?  Ubuntu identified it as AVI, but it doesn't play properly
2008-06-23T02:26:00.000Z	Bllz		jewfro... but it's motion jpeg... now i'm lost
2008-06-23T02:27:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Bllz	mplayer
2008-06-23T02:28:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Bllz	what's the source video from?
2008-06-23T02:28:00.000Z	Bllz	gordonjcp	 a digital camera
2008-06-23T02:28:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Bllz	ah
2008-06-23T02:28:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Bllz	yeah, they sometimes have "funny" files
2008-06-23T02:28:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Bllz	maybe you can try recoding it with avidemux
2008-06-23T02:29:00.000Z	Bllz	gordonjcp	 what's the package for that?
2008-06-23T02:29:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Bllz	just avidemux
2008-06-23T02:29:00.000Z	Bllz	gordonjcp	 i'll give it a shot thanks
2008-06-23T02:30:00.000Z	Bllz	gordonjcp	 avidemux can play it ... so i'm a bit confuzzled at this point
2008-06-23T02:31:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Bllz	mplayer is very good at what it does, avidemux is very good at what it does, but these are not both the same thing ;-)
2008-06-23T02:31:00.000Z	gordonjcp	Bllz	oh, and as you've no doubt figured out, mjpeg isn't just mjpeg
2008-06-23T02:31:00.000Z	Bllz	gordonjcp	 yeah i guess so lol.  well i'm sure that if it can play it , it can also transcode it
