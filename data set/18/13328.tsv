2006-01-09T11:55:00.000Z	Stork		i presume i need to install windows to be able to game
2006-01-09T11:56:00.000Z	Stork		right, so what sort of games like ubuntu?
2006-01-09T11:56:00.000Z	Jowi	Stork	some good ones are Quake2, egoboo, neverputt
2006-01-09T14:08:00.000Z	Jowi	Stork	install sdl (apt-cache search --names-only sdl. that will give you some to choose from )
2006-01-10T09:26:00.000Z	Jowi	Stork	install gstreamer0.8-mad
2006-01-10T09:27:00.000Z	Stork	Jowi	not found on apt-get
2006-01-10T09:28:00.000Z	Jowi	Stork	because in some countries, some of the software is in a legal gray zone
2006-01-10T09:29:00.000Z	Jowi	Stork	the whole US?
2006-01-10T09:29:00.000Z	Stork	Jowi	good point, the US has given such incredible cultural contributions to the world.. Like rap, obesity, and microsoft.
2006-01-10T09:31:00.000Z	Jowi	Stork	actually, when rap first started to appear in europe, it caused a huge sub-cultural phenomena :)
2006-01-10T09:32:00.000Z	Jowi	Stork	sorry, getting off topic in here. someone slap me
2006-01-10T11:27:00.000Z	Jowi	Stork	can it play normal mp3 for you?
2006-01-10T11:27:00.000Z	Stork	Jowi	i'll check
2006-01-10T11:29:00.000Z	Jowi	Stork	Dr_Willis, i was under the impression, or guessed, that gsteamer0.8-mad handled both the mp3 and the m3u part. maybe i'm mistaken
2006-01-10T11:30:00.000Z	Jowi	Stork	I'm only aware that xmms can handle m3u. haven't tried with rhythmbox
2006-01-10T11:31:00.000Z	Jowi	Stork	if rhythmbox plays mp3 fine then I guess it is just not supporting the m3u's :)
2006-04-11T05:03:00.000Z	Jowi	Stork	have a glance at the sound preferences for gnome, or gdmsetup
