2009-07-23T04:17:00.000Z	vr_mex		after doing sudo /etc/init.d/ssh restart i got Could not load host key: /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key so how do i generate those system wide keys?
2009-07-23T04:19:00.000Z	losher	vr_mex	the keys are usually autogenerated when you do a successfull sshd (Note the d at the end of sshd) install. Did that not happen?
2009-07-23T04:20:00.000Z	vr_mex	losher	when i did the sudo: /etc/init.d/sshd restart i got a command not found
2009-07-23T04:21:00.000Z	losher	vr_mex	then you don't have sshd installed. Do you understand the difference between ssh and sshd? Let me know if not...
2009-07-23T04:22:00.000Z	vr_mex	losher	i do have sshd installed i do which sshd and get /usr/sbin/sshd
2009-07-23T04:23:00.000Z	losher	vr_mex	If I were you, I would reinstall it, as it seems like something went wrong with your install....
2009-07-23T04:23:00.000Z	vr_mex	losher	how do i reinstall do i uninstall via synaptic and the re install ?
2009-07-23T04:24:00.000Z	losher	vr_mex	yes, that would work fine. Keep an eye out for messages about generating keys when you do the reinstall...
2009-07-23T04:25:00.000Z	vr_mex	losher	ok thanks let me try it out
2009-07-23T04:32:00.000Z	losher	vr_mex	the *host* key just identifies the server. It's a safety feature to alert you in case someone replaces the server with a counterfeit machine. It's different to the *session* keys you use to login. You don't want a passphrase for the host key.
2009-07-23T04:33:00.000Z	vr_mex	losher	Aaahhhh so that is why!!! :-)
2009-07-23T04:34:00.000Z	losher	vr_mex	the beginnings of wisdom, grasshopper :-)
2009-07-23T04:34:00.000Z	vr_mex	losher	so then i do not need to regenerate them just leave them there alone... :-)))
2009-07-23T04:35:00.000Z	vr_mex	losher	since i moved them can you please give me the permissions they should have so that i place them back again correctly
2009-07-23T04:36:00.000Z	losher	vr_mex	the host key is usually generated *once* when you install sshd. After that, you generally don't want it to change because if it changes, ssh will worry that it means the machine changed. It's just a security feature. Session keys for logging in are dealt with separately.
2009-07-23T04:37:00.000Z	vr_mex	losher	since i moved them can you please give me the permissions they should have so that i place them back again correctly
2009-07-23T04:39:00.000Z	losher	vr_mex	my host keys are in /etc/ssh and have permissions rw for root for the private part, and rw-r-r for the public part. Does this make sense?
2009-07-23T04:40:00.000Z	vr_mex	losher	shure thank you very much ! :-)
