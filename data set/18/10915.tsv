2008-12-26T07:43:00.000Z	nicolas		Hey guys,
2008-12-26T07:44:00.000Z	nicolas		anybody have any ideas?
2008-12-26T07:46:00.000Z	nicolas		oh yeah, it says when I try to play a movie, it says: "Could not read from source" any ideas?
2008-12-26T07:46:00.000Z	remu	nicolas	were you able to get information as to how to get dvds playing?
2008-12-26T07:47:00.000Z	nicolas	remu	no, I tried downloading all the codecs but still it wont work, Totem attempts to play a movie but then it says that it cant read source
2008-12-26T07:47:00.000Z	remu	nicolas	I take it that this is for a retail dvd?
2008-12-26T07:47:00.000Z	nicolas	remu	YES
2008-12-26T07:47:00.000Z	nicolas	remu	IS THAT Why it wont work????
2008-12-26T07:48:00.000Z	remu	nicolas	Yes, because retail DVDs are encrypted. And for license purposes, Ubuntu can't be shipped with the ability to play them right off the bat.
2008-12-26T07:49:00.000Z	nicolas	remu	OHHH
2008-12-26T07:49:00.000Z	nicolas	remu	so is there any software available on synaptic that I should know about??
2008-12-26T07:49:00.000Z	remu	nicolas	yes and no. It is not available in the standard Canonical repositories.
2008-12-26T07:50:00.000Z	nicolas	remu	ok, know of any programs that I could search for?
2008-12-26T07:50:00.000Z	remu	nicolas	http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu:Intrepid#DVD_Playback_Capability and https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Medibuntu and
2008-12-26T07:51:00.000Z	remu	nicolas	I've found that ubuntuguide.org can come in handy, I would bookmark it. Good Luck!
2008-12-26T07:51:00.000Z	nicolas	remu	thank you very much, I'm gonna look this up right now
2008-12-26T07:52:00.000Z	remu	nicolas	No worries.
2008-12-26T07:53:00.000Z	remu	nicolas	I personally would reccommend the Medibuntu route, because there are other programs available through that repository, things such as GoogleEarth, Skype, Adobe Reader, etc.
