2011-10-20T02:45:00.000Z	Zungete	ActionParsnip	well, it happens in single after executing any command in menu, and after i type any command in shell, and in normal if i don't touch anything and when i login
2011-10-20T02:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Zungete	does the desktop completely lock up?
2011-10-20T02:48:00.000Z	Zungete	ActionParsnip	yeah, it looks like that, no input response, also i got locked up one time and i found input has stopped working, and some times display freezes but system still works and sometimes it happened right when i tryed to switch screens
2011-10-20T02:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Zungete	when it locks, can you press CTRL+ALT+F1 and get a login prompt?
