2006-05-17T16:18:00.000Z	ex-parrot		I'm getting a "no such device" message... I did change the NIC right before upgrading but breezy recognised this fine and was working
2006-05-17T16:18:00.000Z	ex-parrot		no it doesn't Ng
2006-05-17T16:19:00.000Z	ex-parrot		oh it's showing an eth2
2006-05-17T16:19:00.000Z	ex-parrot		I'm rather loath to re-install as I finally got postfix working
2006-05-17T16:19:00.000Z	ex-parrot		but I needed to upgrade to support my new dual CPU motherboard properly
2006-05-17T16:20:00.000Z	ex-parrot		why would it jump right in and give it eth2?
2006-05-17T16:20:00.000Z	ex-parrot		then insist it still doesn't exist?
2006-05-17T16:21:00.000Z	ex-parrot		just ifrenaming eth2 to eth0 seems to have fixed it
2006-05-17T16:21:00.000Z	ex-parrot		for now anyway
2006-05-17T16:22:00.000Z	ex-parrot		ahem?
2006-05-17T16:23:00.000Z	dli	ex-parrot	why not use udev rules to fix eth names?
2006-05-17T16:23:00.000Z	ex-parrot	dli	don't know about udev... is it new in dapper?
2006-05-17T16:24:00.000Z	dli	ex-parrot	http://dev-loki.blogspot.com/2005_12_01_dev-loki_archive.html
2006-05-17T16:24:00.000Z	ex-parrot		thanks dli I'll take a look
2006-05-17T16:24:00.000Z	dli	ex-parrot	udev is supported since kernel 2.6.8, iirc
2006-05-17T16:25:00.000Z	ex-parrot		nevermind dli, fixing iftab seems to have solved it
2006-05-17T16:25:00.000Z	dli	ex-parrot	ifrename is not a real solution, udev is
2006-05-17T16:26:00.000Z	ex-parrot	dli	how so? I'm not overly fussed so long as it works...
