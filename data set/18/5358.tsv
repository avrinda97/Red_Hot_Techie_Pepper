2010-01-06T11:33:00.000Z	kevin__	Out_Cold	the adobe flash player plugin and like play buttons and enter buttons
2010-01-06T11:35:00.000Z	Out_Cold	kevin__	have you installed flash plugin from the synaptic?
2010-01-06T11:35:00.000Z	Out_Cold	kevin__	flash-nonfree?
2010-01-06T11:36:00.000Z	Out_Cold	kevin__	and what about flashplugin-nonfree?
2010-01-06T11:37:00.000Z	Out_Cold	kevin__	try that then see

2010-01-06T11:39:00.000Z	Out_Cold	kevin__	are you using firefox?
2010-01-06T11:40:00.000Z	Out_Cold	kevin__	try this link and tell me what it says http://www.adobe.com/software/flash/about/
2010-01-06T11:42:00.000Z	Out_Cold	kevin__	i'm not sure then? maybe if you can find some other help in here..
2010-01-06T11:42:00.000Z	kevin__	Out_Cold	is there another flash player I can use?
2010-01-06T11:43:00.000Z	Out_Cold	kevin__	remove adobe first though i think
2010-01-06T11:48:00.000Z	Out_Cold	kevin__	try clicking it?
2010-01-06T11:51:00.000Z	Out_Cold	kevin__	you can play with those 2 flash plugins and firefox.. try a different approach?
2010-01-06T11:52:00.000Z	Out_Cold	kevin__	dev libs are only really useful if you are building adobe from source
