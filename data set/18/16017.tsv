2011-10-26T16:39:00.000Z	Tech-1		anyone wanna help w/grub ?
2011-10-26T16:39:00.000Z	Tech-1		I just need to know why my kernel wont upgrade
2011-10-26T16:40:00.000Z	Tech-1		been there done that..nice try
2011-10-26T16:40:00.000Z	dr_willis	Tech-1	 sudo update-grub dosent show the new kernels?
2011-10-26T16:40:00.000Z	dr_willis	Tech-1	 more details would be handy. :)
2011-10-26T16:42:00.000Z	dr_willis	Tech-1	 so when you run sudo update-grub, does it find the other kernels?
2011-10-26T16:42:00.000Z	dr_willis	Tech-1	 check the existing /boot/grub/grub.cfg file. see if they are in fact listed. its Possible that grub is using some other file..
2011-10-26T16:43:00.000Z	dr_willis	Tech-1	 this is Just a ubuntu system? dualk boot? more then 1 disrto?
2011-10-26T16:43:00.000Z	dr_willis	Tech-1	 sounds to me like grub is using the config for the other disrto most likely.
2011-10-26T16:44:00.000Z	dr_willis	Tech-1	 why have  both installed as differnt installs you can install kubuntu desktop over ubuntu, and select theone to use at the login screen
2011-10-26T16:44:00.000Z	dr_willis	Tech-1	 i would remove one of the disrtros if they are the same version. Not really gaining much by having it that way
2011-10-26T16:45:00.000Z	dr_willis	Tech-1	 what one are you in now? what version also,. what version is the other?
2011-10-26T16:46:00.000Z	dr_willis	Tech-1	 both are 11.10 or 11.04 or what?
2011-10-26T16:47:00.000Z	dr_willis	Tech-1	 why did you bother with a custome kernel?
2011-10-26T16:49:00.000Z	dr_willis	Tech-1	 you are curently on Kubuntu? or Ubuntu install?
2011-10-26T17:34:00.000Z	dr_willis	Tech-1	 seems your kernel is not configured to use apparmor
2011-10-26T17:35:00.000Z	dr_willis	Tech-1	 No idea. I dont do custome kernels.. one of the reasons i use ubuntu.
