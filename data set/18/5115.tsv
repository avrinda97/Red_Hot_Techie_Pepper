2009-06-18T00:18:00.000Z	StephenZ		Well, I'm back, after giving up last night.
2009-06-18T00:20:00.000Z	StephenZ		It's in the view settings; don't know how to describe it accurately without having it up.
2009-06-18T00:21:00.000Z	StephenZ		Anyhow... I'm having trouble with my Jaunty install. First, the disc was completely not working... Then I burned and checked another LiveCD, and that installed properly - I even got into Ubuntu long enough to update and add a couple hundred programs.
2009-06-18T00:22:00.000Z	StephenZ		But when I rebooted, and it tried to start up...
2009-06-18T00:22:00.000Z	StephenZ		I got to the very end of the Ubuntu loading bar, and everything went nuts. Garbage all over the screen, totally nonresponsive...
2009-06-18T00:23:00.000Z	StephenZ		Happens every time I try to boot.
2009-06-18T00:23:00.000Z	hatter243	StephenZ	when you get to the garbage: Does pressing CTRL+ALT+F1 bring you to a terminal prompt?
2009-06-18T00:24:00.000Z	StephenZ	hatter243	No. I tried getting into the virtual terminal sessions, but the keyboard is TOTALLY nonresponsive. NumLock etc are nonresponsive, as well.
2009-06-18T00:25:00.000Z	hatter243	StephenZ	have you tried any of the Recovery options?
2009-06-18T00:26:00.000Z	StephenZ	hatter243	No; not sure how to go about that. Elaborate?
2009-06-18T00:27:00.000Z	hatter243	StephenZ	when you read grub on boot up, press "Esc", choose your kernel version with the word "Recovery" at the end. Attempt the repairs in there.
2009-06-18T00:28:00.000Z	StephenZ	hatter243	Anything else I should know, before I take this awesome information and put it to use?
2009-06-18T00:29:00.000Z	hatter243	StephenZ	Possibly, if you can get to a command line "sudo apt-get install pastebinit && cat /var/log/Xorg.0.log | pastebinit
2009-06-18T00:30:00.000Z	StephenZ	hatter243	Will do, thansk.
2009-06-18T00:31:00.000Z	hatter243	StephenZ	good luck!
2009-06-18T01:06:00.000Z	StephenZ	hatter243	You still around? I gave it a shot.
2009-06-18T01:07:00.000Z	StephenZ	hatter243	I actually tried ALL of the GRUB recovery options, and tried to boot... Same response. Nonresponsive inputs, garbage all over th screen.
2009-06-18T01:08:00.000Z	StephenZ	hatter243	Well, whenevery you're back around, I'm attempting to install Jaunty on a different harddrive, to see what happens - if I have no problems, I'm chalking this up to a hardware error, which is what I've been afraid of for a while.
