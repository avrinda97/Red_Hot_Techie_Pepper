2011-10-17T07:13:00.000Z	ward_	x_	i jsut need a way to do what the wacom GUI config tool thing does
2011-10-17T07:13:00.000Z	ward_	x_	only then from CLI
2011-10-17T07:14:00.000Z	ward_	x_	this config thing in ubuntu for wacom tablets has an invert option
2011-10-17T07:14:00.000Z	x_	ward_	see if the gui program can be run from command line.
2011-10-17T07:15:00.000Z	ward_	x_	i was doing that, but it can't
2011-10-17T07:15:00.000Z	ward_	x_	its this "panel"
2011-10-17T07:15:00.000Z	ward_	x_	not an executable
2011-10-17T07:15:00.000Z	x_	ward_	find another program that works with wacom?
2011-10-17T07:15:00.000Z	ward_	x_	erm why? all programs work fine with wacom
2011-10-17T07:16:00.000Z	x_	ward_	I mean to invert it from command line.
2011-10-17T07:16:00.000Z	ward_	x_	yeah i tried that too, no luck either :(
2011-10-17T07:17:00.000Z	ward_	x_	so far its a giant mistery how/what is driving the wacom
2011-10-17T07:18:00.000Z	ward_	x_	i bet if i knew that, i could figure the rest out myself
