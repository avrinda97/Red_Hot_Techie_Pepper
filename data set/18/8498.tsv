2007-09-30T05:31:00.000Z	sensae		What's the command for reconfiguring xorg to use different resolutions?
2007-09-30T05:33:00.000Z	sensae		What's the dpkg-configure command to reconfigure xorg?
2007-09-30T05:33:00.000Z	scguy318	sensae	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2007-09-30T06:35:00.000Z	scguy318	sensae	yes, theres GrubEd on the Ubuntu Forums, script utility
2007-09-30T06:35:00.000Z	scguy318	sensae	or you can manually edit /boot/grub/menu.lst as root of course
2007-10-01T09:19:00.000Z	scguy318	sensae	what's the error? and have you tried modprobing it?
2007-10-01T09:20:00.000Z	sensae	scguy318	The error is cannot find module, and I get the same error with modprobe. I may be going about this the wrong way
2007-10-01T09:21:00.000Z	sensae	scguy318	http://www.alsa-project.org/main/index.php/Matrix:Module-hda-intel <-- that's my sound card and the appropriate module I need, but I'm not sure how to go about getting ALSA working
2007-10-01T09:26:00.000Z	scguy318	sensae	i think we have a guide to HDA Intel in the wiki
2007-10-01T09:26:00.000Z	sensae	scguy318	Sorry, I didn't see your post
2007-10-01T09:27:00.000Z	scguy318	sensae	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/DebuggingSoundProblems  for now
2007-10-01T09:27:00.000Z	scguy318	sensae	lemme find the one about the Intel
2007-10-01T09:32:00.000Z	scguy318	sensae	yeah, Wine has a long way to go, through it's made very good strides, and I've gotten some games to run better on Linux
2007-10-01T09:35:00.000Z	sensae	scguy318	would you consider it a good or bad idea to use the alsa rc?
2007-10-01T09:35:00.000Z	scguy318	sensae	the ALSA config file? mm, dunno, could take a shot
2007-10-01T09:36:00.000Z	sensae	scguy318	No, alsa itself. the hda walkthrough tells me to upgrade alsa from their site directly, and they have rcs
2007-10-01T09:36:00.000Z	scguy318	sensae	ah, yeah, you can try that
2007-10-01T09:36:00.000Z	scguy318	sensae	it shouldn't be ultra-deadly
