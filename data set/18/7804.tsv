2007-11-17T18:31:00.000Z	marcioapf	juano__	whaty is this?
2007-11-17T18:31:00.000Z	juano__	marcioapf	thats a tool for mounting /read/write ntfs partitions
2007-11-17T18:33:00.000Z	juano__	marcioapf	id say that the normal ntfs mounting mode is a little buggy from my point of view, and i wouldnt recomend a chmod 777 to the whole disk cause thats a little messy to do
