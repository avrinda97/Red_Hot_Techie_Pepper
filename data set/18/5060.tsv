2008-12-22T02:31:00.000Z	mib_qeoc9m		Ok, just did a clean install of 8.10 on my laptop replacing my old 8.04. Now my sound does not work and Wifi dies on hibernate. Can anyone here help me with either of those issues?
2008-12-22T02:33:00.000Z	mib_qeoc9m		oh the sound servers
2008-12-22T02:34:00.000Z	mib_qeoc9m		only have one sound device
2008-12-22T02:36:00.000Z	LTL	mib_qeoc9m	you'll lose x windows un-installing pulse without extra steps fyi.
2008-12-22T02:37:00.000Z	mib_qeoc9m	LTL	what are you talking about?
2008-12-22T02:37:00.000Z	mib_qeoc9m	LTL	I have removed it and reinstalled it many times on different machines
2008-12-22T02:39:00.000Z	LTL	mib_qeoc9m	GodfatherofEire in /etc/X11/Xsession.d/  you'll see a pulseadio file, get rid of it, or uncheckit from loading in perference/sessions
2008-12-22T02:49:00.000Z	LTL	mib_qeoc9m	well if it ws easy, wouldn/t be much fun 'eh!
2008-12-22T02:40:00.000Z	LTL	mib_qeoc9m	your mileage may vary...
2008-12-22T02:40:00.000Z	mib_qeoc9m	LTL	Yea, I already uninstalled it...that file is not there any longer
2008-12-22T02:40:00.000Z	LTL	mib_qeoc9m	then you'll be ok.
2008-12-22T02:41:00.000Z	LTL	mib_qeoc9m	yeah, that most likely cleaned things up properly.
2008-12-22T02:42:00.000Z	LTL	mib_qeoc9m	i installed esound to get around pulse on intrepid, wasnt exactly painless.
2008-12-22T02:43:00.000Z	LTL	mib_qeoc9m	thats common.
2008-12-22T02:45:00.000Z	LTL	mib_qeoc9m	not sure what you mean, i had to un-install pulseaudio to fix my sound, old hardware and a soundblaster card.
2008-12-22T02:46:00.000Z	mib_qeoc9m	LTL	I actually just reinstalled it and pulseaudio works, my whole problem was that it was muted.
2008-12-22T02:48:00.000Z	LTL	mib_qeoc9m	i wish i was as lucky pulse was fine under hardy.
2008-12-22T02:49:00.000Z	mib_qeoc9m	LTL	If I remember correctly pulse did not work on this machine in hardy. Had to use alsa, in 7.10 I had to actually recompile alsa to get it to work. So things are not regressing for everyone :)
