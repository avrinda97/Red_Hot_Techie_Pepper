2005-08-29T08:56:00.000Z	JumpManJr		Installing  Ubuntu for the first time.  3 hard drives first drive is only 2.1 gig and this needs to be boot drive.  Next drive is 6.4 gig and can't be boot drive (Don't ask)  I have 3rd drive 1 gig I'm using for swap.  So is 1st drive mounted at /boot second drive mounted at / correct?
2005-08-29T08:57:00.000Z	bob2	JumpManJr	don't bother putting /boot anywhere special
2005-08-29T08:57:00.000Z	bob2	JumpManJr	put / on the first disk
2005-08-29T08:57:00.000Z	JumpManJr	bob2	ok what do I put on second dirve?
2005-08-29T08:57:00.000Z	bob2	JumpManJr	/home or something
2005-08-29T08:58:00.000Z	bob2	JumpManJr	yes there is, a base install is 1.8GB, including /var being full of crap
2005-08-29T08:58:00.000Z	JumpManJr	bob2	 I ran through it and got an error.
2005-08-29T08:58:00.000Z	bob2	JumpManJr	are you sure it's really 2.1GB?
2005-08-29T08:59:00.000Z	bob2	JumpManJr	well, try putting /var on the other disk then
2005-08-29T09:01:00.000Z	bob2	JumpManJr	just make all of the second disk /var, you can fix this up later
2005-08-29T09:02:00.000Z	JumpManJr	bob2	are you helping all these people? Thanks for taking the time to help me.  ;-)
2005-08-29T09:11:00.000Z	JumpManJr	bob2	install is continuing with 2.1 gig ext3 mounted at / and 6.4 ext3 mounted at /var.  After I finish the instal how do I fix it so /home is on 6.4 gig drive with /var?
2005-08-29T09:16:00.000Z	JumpManJr	bob2	 Lot of stuff going by here.  If you can point me in the right direction I'ld appreciate it.  Just tell me what to read.  I don't see it on ubuntu's support page.
2005-08-29T09:17:00.000Z	bob2	JumpManJr	it's not an ubuntu thing
2005-08-29T09:18:00.000Z	JumpManJr	bob2	 hmmm okay so I want to read how-to on what?
2005-08-29T09:18:00.000Z	bob2	JumpManJr	boot into single-user mode.  umount /var/.  mount what was /var on /mnt/.  copy contents to /var/.  come back up.  make sure it worked.  then delete the contents of /mnt/.
2005-08-29T09:19:00.000Z	JumpManJr	bob2	won't it try to remount the old var when I come back up?
2005-08-29T09:20:00.000Z	bob2	JumpManJr	yes, you have to fix /etc/fstab, too
