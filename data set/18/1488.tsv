2011-02-08T10:43:00.000Z	RedXIII		Can anyone help me? I recently restored GRUB2 using the livecd, and now my ubuntu boots into tty1 and not gnome
2011-02-08T10:43:00.000Z	RedXIII		I tried startx, but it says "no screens found"
2011-02-08T10:43:00.000Z	RedXIII		alt+crtl+7 does nothing
2011-02-08T10:43:00.000Z	RedXIII		service gdm start says that its already running
2011-02-08T10:45:00.000Z	RedXIII		How can I get X running again?
2011-02-08T10:47:00.000Z	RedXIII		Anyone? How can I recover my gnome desktop?
2011-02-08T10:49:00.000Z	g_0_0	RedXIII	sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
2011-02-08T10:49:00.000Z	RedXIII	g_0_0	unable to resolve ubuntu.com
2011-02-08T10:51:00.000Z	g_0_0	RedXIII	maybe you could edit the sources in /etc/apt/sources.list,  have you got a network connection?
2011-02-08T10:51:00.000Z	RedXIII	g_0_0	also ubuntu-desktop is already installed
2011-02-08T10:51:00.000Z	RedXIII		No network connections, I just got a terminal screen
2011-02-08T10:52:00.000Z	g_0_0	RedXIII	just thought reinstalling ubuntu-desktop might fix your problem
2011-02-08T10:52:00.000Z	RedXIII		no clue x_x
2011-02-08T10:52:00.000Z	RedXIII		It might, if I could get network connections
2011-02-08T10:52:00.000Z	RedXIII		I don't get why it isn't working though. I haven't changed anything
2011-02-08T10:53:00.000Z	g_0_0		stupid question perhaps - have you rebooted?
2011-02-08T10:53:00.000Z	RedXIII	g_0_0	twice, same result
2011-02-08T10:54:00.000Z	g_0_0	RedXIII	and this happened after editing grub?
