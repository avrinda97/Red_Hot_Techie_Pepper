2005-01-05T10:05:00.000Z	SomeOtherNerd	siretart	root is a different group and has a *very* different purpose than wheel
2005-01-05T10:05:00.000Z	siretart	SomeOtherNerd	yes? please explain
2005-01-05T10:06:00.000Z	SomeOtherNerd	siretart	group root is meant for root to be able to have a umask of 002, allowing group projects, but preventing any user other than root from writing to roots files
2005-01-05T10:07:00.000Z	siretart	SomeOtherNerd	what is the drawback for using the group wheel like the group root?
2005-01-05T10:08:00.000Z	SomeOtherNerd	siretart	root must not have a umask of 00*, making group projects harder
2005-01-05T10:09:00.000Z	SomeOtherNerd	siretart	on a single user machine, or even a family machine, it doesn't matter, but it does on machines like shell.sourceforge.net
2005-01-05T10:09:00.000Z	siretart	SomeOtherNerd	I'm note quite sure what you mean with group projects. All members of the group root have root access anyway, so I don't understand the difference..
2005-01-05T10:11:00.000Z	SomeOtherNerd	siretart	lets say you have a website in /var/www/grproj.example.net user: rmx group: grproj
2005-01-05T10:11:00.000Z	SomeOtherNerd	siretart	you want any user in group grproj to be able to read/write to /var/www/grproj.example.net
2005-01-05T10:12:00.000Z	SomeOtherNerd	siretart	so /var/www/grproj.example.net should have perms 2775
2005-01-05T10:13:00.000Z	siretart	SomeOtherNerd	so far I understood, but whats the problem with the root group now?
2005-01-05T10:13:00.000Z	SomeOtherNerd	siretart	if root wants to change something in /var/www/grproj.example.net, s/he has to have a umask of 002 to keep perms the same
2005-01-05T10:13:00.000Z	SomeOtherNerd	siretart	if root has a umask of 002, any user of group root can edit his/her files
2005-01-05T10:14:00.000Z	SomeOtherNerd	siretart	EOT
2005-01-05T10:15:00.000Z	siretart	SomeOtherNerd	this seems to me only a problem when working a lot as root, which is deprecated anyways. I think I see your point, but not the practical relevance when using root only for doing small administrative jobs
2005-01-05T10:16:00.000Z	SomeOtherNerd	siretart	you're right, this applies more to common users than root
2005-01-05T10:17:00.000Z	siretart	SomeOtherNerd	but thanks for your explanation. next time I setup a server like shell.sf.net I'll remember that. :)
2005-01-05T10:18:00.000Z	SomeOtherNerd	siretart	shell.sf.net isn't *a* server, it's *many* servers
