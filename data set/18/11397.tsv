2006-07-31T08:38:00.000Z	micahcowan	cerda_	hrm... you're pinging domain names, or raw IP addresses?
2006-07-31T08:41:00.000Z	micahcowan	cerda_	so, just to be clear, you can ping a given site, but not access it with your browser?
2006-07-31T08:41:00.000Z	cerda_	micahcowan	yes, actually i cant connect with kopete too
2006-07-31T08:42:00.000Z	micahcowan	cerda_	Are you using IRC from that system right now (I'm assuming not)?
2006-07-31T08:42:00.000Z	cerda_	micahcowan	no
2006-07-31T08:44:00.000Z	cerda_	micahcowan	do u know how can i set my network card to work in 10mbits??
2006-07-31T08:45:00.000Z	micahcowan	cerda_	I'm not sure :(
2006-07-31T08:45:00.000Z	micahcowan	cerda_	what exactly happens when you try to connect with your browser?
2006-07-31T08:51:00.000Z	cerda_	micahcowan	when i run pppoeconf it says: access concentrator of your provider did not respond, does it help?? :/
2006-07-31T08:52:00.000Z	micahcowan	cerda_	doesn't mean much to me. :( ...what happens if you "telnet www.yahoo.com 80"?
2006-07-31T08:54:00.000Z	cerda_	micahcowan	it connected
2006-07-31T08:54:00.000Z	micahcowan	cerda_	type "GET / HTTP/1.0" followed by two <return>s
2006-07-31T08:55:00.000Z	cerda_	micahcowan	no problem if im using kubuntu right?
2006-07-31T08:56:00.000Z	micahcowan	cerda_	heh, that's a good way to get #kubuntu! shouted at you here. But I for one don't care: and it certainly shouldn't affect your problem.
2006-07-31T08:57:00.000Z	micahcowan	cerda_	that "GET" stuff was meant to be in the telnet session, BTW.
