2006-03-07T11:22:00.000Z	HammerBlade2020		wastrel~ i'm not on a live-cd
2006-03-07T11:22:00.000Z	HammerBlade2020		wastrel~ i'm on an HD installed breezy
2006-03-07T11:24:00.000Z	HammerBlade2020		i guess it is heat
2006-03-07T11:24:00.000Z	HammerBlade2020		localhost kernel [4295943.270000]  CPU1: Temperature above threshold
2006-03-07T11:24:00.000Z	HammerBlade2020		what should i do about heat?
2006-03-07T11:24:00.000Z	cafuego	HammerBlade2020	check cpu fan
2006-03-07T11:25:00.000Z	cafuego	HammerBlade2020	That would help to see if the fan is spinning, yes.
2006-03-07T11:25:00.000Z	cafuego	HammerBlade2020	That's trivial. See if it's broken first.
2006-03-07T11:26:00.000Z	cafuego	HammerBlade2020	If the fan is not spinning, it's broken.
2006-03-07T11:28:00.000Z	cafuego	HammerBlade2020	is it making  a noise whilst spinning?
2006-03-07T11:29:00.000Z	cafuego	HammerBlade2020	Does it sound unhealthy (rattle, squeak, whine) or ok?
2006-03-07T11:30:00.000Z	cafuego	HammerBlade2020	Install 'hddtemp' to see HOW hot the HD is.
2006-03-07T11:31:00.000Z	cafuego	HammerBlade2020	36C is not a problem.
