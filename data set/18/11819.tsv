2009-05-16T22:33:00.000Z	TU		every release i spend at LEAST fucking 2 hours fixing whatever was broken about dns
2009-05-16T22:34:00.000Z	jrib	TU	this channel is for support.  If something is broken, file a bug (hopefully in a more civil manner).
2009-05-16T22:34:00.000Z	TU	jrib	thats fine.
2009-05-16T22:34:00.000Z	TU		but i don't know what is wrong.
2009-05-16T22:34:00.000Z	TU		i don't know WHY my dns is broken, again.
2009-05-16T22:34:00.000Z	TU		dig works fine.
2009-05-16T22:35:00.000Z	jrib	TU	try to describe your problem on a single line.  Explain what you did to fix it
2009-05-16T22:35:00.000Z	TU		so it is wierd because JUST firefox/ephiphany is having slow resolution times.
2009-05-16T22:35:00.000Z	TU	jrib	Firefox is takign really long to (seemingly) resolve urls.  i've done nothing to fix this because i'm not sure what changed.
