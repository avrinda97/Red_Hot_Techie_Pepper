2010-06-28T11:17:00.000Z	zoidfarb	afed	are you serious, or trolling?
2010-06-28T11:17:00.000Z	afed	zoidfarb	would you expect a troll to admit trolling at this point?
2010-06-28T11:17:00.000Z	afed		why even ask?
2010-06-28T11:18:00.000Z	afed		i asked a question here a few hours ago
2010-06-28T11:18:00.000Z	afed		will repeat now that i have attention
2010-06-28T11:18:00.000Z	afed		i am confused about ubuntu 64 bit version not being recommended
2010-06-28T11:18:00.000Z	afed		why isn't it recommended?  i'd rather use it if i could
2010-06-28T11:18:00.000Z	afed		the front page of ubuntu's web site
2010-06-28T11:18:00.000Z	zoidfarb	afed	there is some software that is not available for the 64 bit version, and other software that works, but is more of a hassle to set up
2010-06-28T11:18:00.000Z	afed		http://www.ubuntu.com/desktop/get-ubuntu/download
2010-06-28T11:19:00.000Z	zoidfarb	afed	so if you don't know what you're doing, you're better off with 32-bit
2010-06-28T11:19:00.000Z	afed		32-bit - Recommended for most users
2010-06-28T11:19:00.000Z	afed		64-bit - Not recommended for daily desktop usage
2010-06-28T11:19:00.000Z	zoidfarb	afed	the adobe flash plugin is an example of software that newbs will expect to "just work" but is not easily available on 64-bit (because Adobe doesn't really support it, as I understand)
