2009-07-31T08:24:00.000Z	JuJuBee		I have a dvd of  pictures that was burned on a MAC and when I insert it I see the volume label but no data.  I installed hfsplus and hfsutils
2009-07-31T08:24:00.000Z	JuJuBee		I think the dvd was burned for / with the MAC filesystem
2009-07-31T08:25:00.000Z	mechtech	JuJuBee	got another computer around to put the disk into?
2009-07-31T08:26:00.000Z	JuJuBee	mechtech	does that matter?
2009-07-31T08:27:00.000Z	mechtech	JuJuBee	no, I just thought to myself (if she's able to get the volume label to appear, then the drive is fine...it's prolly the filesystem on the disk)
2009-07-31T08:28:00.000Z	JuJuBee	mechtech	I thought that since it can be read on a mac that if I  installed hfsplus I could read it
2009-07-31T08:29:00.000Z	mechtech	JuJuBee	when you (or whomever) burned the disk...how did they do it?
2009-07-31T08:29:00.000Z	mechtech	JuJuBee	using what program
2009-07-31T08:32:00.000Z	mechtech	JuJuBee	yes...what DAZ is saying
2009-07-31T08:33:00.000Z	mechtech	JuJuBee	ISO9660 to be exact
2009-07-31T08:34:00.000Z	mechtech	JuJuBee	could it be possible that it is a SLIDESHOW DVD made with iDVD?
2009-07-31T08:34:00.000Z	JuJuBee	mechtech	suppose anything is possible since I did not burn it.
2009-07-31T08:34:00.000Z	mechtech	JuJuBee	and not a DATA DVD made with disk utility?
2009-07-31T08:35:00.000Z	mechtech	JuJuBee	lemme do a little research...brb
2009-07-31T08:36:00.000Z	mechtech	JuJuBee	that's code for: "I'm gonna smoke, then google the crap out of this issue!"  LOL
2009-07-31T08:44:00.000Z	mechtech	JuJuBee	try this: http://www.isobuster.com/
2009-07-31T08:44:00.000Z	mechtech	JuJuBee	sorry...thought you said you mounted it
2009-07-31T08:52:00.000Z	mechtech	JuJuBee	thought you were saying hi, but that was to screech...my bad
