2008-11-10T15:58:00.000Z	FrauHansen		Hi, I'm trying to convert a rpm to deb using alien. it gives me an error. can someone have a look and tell me whats wrong? http://pastebin.com/d445bb9ed
2008-11-10T15:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	FrauHansen	you need sudo to run alien
2008-11-10T16:00:00.000Z	FrauHansen	ActionParsnip1	i'm root
2008-11-10T16:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	FrauHansen	oh, ok
2008-11-10T16:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	FrauHansen	did you install alien via repos?
2008-11-10T16:01:00.000Z	FrauHansen	ActionParsnip1	yes sir: apt-get install alien
2008-11-10T16:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	FrauHansen	is there not a debian native alternative?
2008-11-10T16:02:00.000Z	FrauHansen	ActionParsnip1	unfortunately not. IBM only supports SLES and red hat
2008-11-10T16:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	FrauHansen	if theres an RPM is there not source you can compile?
2008-11-10T16:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	FrauHansen	you will need to provide those libraries that alien is moaning about
2008-11-10T16:03:00.000Z	FrauHansen	ActionParsnip1	no. let's just say i've got to work with these packages :(
2008-11-10T16:04:00.000Z	FrauHansen	ActionParsnip1	thats what i thought...libraries are tricky...what should i install?
2008-11-10T16:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	FrauHansen	webseach for each library it wants in turn with the word "provides" at the start of each search
2008-11-10T16:05:00.000Z	FrauHansen	ActionParsnip1	you mean those *.so files, just to be shure?
2008-11-10T16:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	FrauHansen	yep
2008-11-10T16:06:00.000Z	FrauHansen	ActionParsnip1	I'll try that. thank you so far
2008-11-10T16:08:00.000Z	FrauHansen	ActionParsnip1	funny thing: google searching libgpfs.so got me directly to a "hot-to" TSM ubuntu blog entry
2008-11-10T16:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	FrauHansen	nice
