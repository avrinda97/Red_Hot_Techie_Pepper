2008-08-14T09:57:00.000Z	ladyfantasy		no, just anything related to that host.

2008-08-14T09:58:00.000Z	ladyfantasy	drezard	do you have a lot of host keys in there?
2008-08-14T09:58:00.000Z	ladyfantasy	drezard	if not, then just delete the .ssh/known_hosts file

2008-08-14T09:59:00.000Z	ladyfantasy		there's probably a better way to do it, but looking at my known_hosts file, i can't see the hostnames or ips in it ... must be something new
