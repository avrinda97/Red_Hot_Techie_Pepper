2005-07-11T12:10:00.000Z	Kyral		I'm bored
2005-07-11T12:10:00.000Z	Kyral		I'm gonna install kubuntu-desktop
2005-07-11T12:10:00.000Z	Kyral		just in case I ever feel like switching
2005-07-11T12:11:00.000Z	Kyral		wow, error
2005-07-11T12:11:00.000Z	Kyral		Kubuntu-Desktop won't install
2005-07-11T12:11:00.000Z	Kyral		says it cannot install Konversation
2005-07-11T12:13:00.000Z	Kyral		kubuntu-desktop: Depends on Konversation but isn't going to be installed
2005-07-11T12:14:00.000Z	Kyral		Hoary
2005-07-11T12:15:00.000Z	Kyral		isn't working for me
2005-07-11T12:15:00.000Z	HappyFool	Kyral	konversation is in 'main', according to apt-cache
2005-07-21T14:12:00.000Z	HappyFool	Kyral	\: ?
2005-07-21T14:12:00.000Z	HappyFool	Kyral	is this maybe on a fat32 partition?
2005-07-21T14:12:00.000Z	HappyFool	Kyral	i would guess colons can't be used there -- think C:
2005-07-29T14:28:00.000Z	HappyFool	Kyral	'man 5 crontab' and 'man crontab'
2005-07-29T14:29:00.000Z	HappyFool	Kyral	you can use the crontab program to install user crontab files
2005-07-29T14:29:00.000Z	HappyFool	Kyral	it's not terribly difficult
2005-08-28T13:36:00.000Z	HappyFool	Kyral	doesn't evolution have some calendering facilities?
2005-08-28T13:36:00.000Z	Kyral	HappyFool	I no like Evolution
