2010-08-06T16:07:00.000Z	sacarlson	minimec	ya sounds like down to grub level problems for n00bzies
2010-08-06T16:09:00.000Z	sacarlson	minimec	n00bzies: if nothing was already on it before you started maybe easier just to reinstall.  if not maybe try supergrub boot disk to fix
2010-09-13T20:25:00.000Z	sacarlson	minimec	good point if you have prepriatary or ppa stuff that might cause a problem but your problems are accross multi platform boots
2010-09-13T20:26:00.000Z	sacarlson	minimec	stealth_: sorry I didn't add the right people to my last statement
2010-09-13T20:28:00.000Z	sacarlson	minimec	ya we should of asked him that sooner
2010-09-13T20:29:00.000Z	minimec	sacarlson	We have to teach them to be more clear from the beginning...
2010-09-13T20:29:00.000Z	minimec	sacarlson	then we can give them better advice...
2010-09-13T20:29:00.000Z	sacarlson	minimec	no we just have to learn to have esp
2010-09-13T20:30:00.000Z	minimec	sacarlson	true.. we also have to learn
2010-11-12T15:52:00.000Z	sacarlson	minimec	well your audio card might be sterio so it can record two sounds with a simple record program
2010-11-12T15:53:00.000Z	sacarlson	minimec	you can create internaly software generated sound with more chanels with a recording software like rosegarden
2010-11-12T15:53:00.000Z	minimec	sacarlson	I have a Zoom H2 and a Logitech Headset. They are both working and shown in 'input devices' in pulseaudio. SHouldn't there be the possibility to mix these two devices and use them as 'recording device'?
2010-11-12T15:54:00.000Z	sacarlson	minimec	sounds like two sound cards yes so you can use rosegarden or other to record them
2010-11-12T15:56:00.000Z	minimec	sacarlson	Even more sound cards. 2x Webcam Sphere + Zoom H2 + Logitech Headset + Internal audio --> 5 input devices. Thx for the Rosegarden hint. Would I be able to stream the mixed devices or does Rosegarden just record them?
2010-11-12T16:02:00.000Z	sacarlson	minimec	I don't know about streaming.  you might be able to setup streaming with jackd if you can get it to work
2010-11-12T16:03:00.000Z	minimec	sacarlson	Yeah... I would like to avoid Jackd, as I never used it. I have no clue how that works ;)
2010-11-12T16:04:00.000Z	sacarlson	minimec	well it's the only software sound mixer I know but maybe pulseaudio will replace it someday or now for all I know
2010-11-12T16:05:00.000Z	minimec	sacarlson	Thx for your ideas anyway. If I find the time I will test a Jackd solution. For now I will just switch record devices with Pavucontrol.
