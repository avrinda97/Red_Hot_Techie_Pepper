2009-03-04T05:08:00.000Z	indro	hmw	okay, will do. ;)
2009-03-04T05:09:00.000Z	indro	hmw	winetricks done. what now?
2009-03-04T05:09:00.000Z	hmw	indro	i remember seing a similar option in winetricks, but I am not completly certain about IE. It installs certain apps, that wouldnt install in wine.
2009-03-04T05:10:00.000Z	indro	hmw	i installed it, how i can use it now?
2009-03-04T05:10:00.000Z	hmw	indro	run it from the terminal
2009-03-04T05:21:00.000Z	indro	hmw	hm still not working. :/
2009-03-04T05:22:00.000Z	hmw	indro	there is an app database on the winehq web site. Maybe you find your program there, and if youre lucky, you might even find work arounds.
