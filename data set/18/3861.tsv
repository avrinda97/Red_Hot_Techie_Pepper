2009-10-12T09:00:00.000Z	mb_again_		!usb
2009-10-12T09:01:00.000Z	dsnyders	mb_again_	was that !usb meant for me?
2009-10-12T09:01:00.000Z	mb_again_	dsnyders	yes, have you already done the basics then?
2009-10-12T09:04:00.000Z	dsnyders	mb_again_	I've plugged and unplugged the flash drive to make sure it is /dev/sdd.  Nautilus refuses to mount it.
2009-10-12T09:04:00.000Z	mb_again_	dsnyders	is it formatted? if so, what format?
2009-10-12T09:04:00.000Z	dsnyders	mb_again_	As root I've issued fdisk commands to see what's on it.  I get back nothing.
2009-10-12T09:08:00.000Z	dsnyders	mb_again_	Will do.  Stand by...

2009-10-12T09:17:00.000Z	mb_again_	dsnyders	looks fine for a new/unused usb key. I am assuming there is no data to save on it, As root you did fdisk /dev/sdd ?
2009-10-12T09:18:00.000Z	dsnyders	mb_again_	It can be wiped.  As root, fdisk /dev/sdd says unable to open /dev/sdd
2009-10-12T09:23:00.000Z	mb_again_	dsnyders	seems odd. I googled and got a few others with similar probs. Is this one of those usb with security features?
2009-10-12T09:25:00.000Z	dsnyders	mb_again_	No.  It's an older unit.  On a windows box it gets detected as a removable drive with no media.
2009-10-12T09:26:00.000Z	mb_again_	dsnyders	divide the probem up and see what is broke. Try another usb key, try a different port,
2009-10-12T09:28:00.000Z	dsnyders	mb_again_	known working USB flash drive on the same port works fine.
2009-10-12T09:40:00.000Z	dsnyders	mb_again_	Stand by on checking usb on different port.  The only ones are on the back of the machine and are difficult to reach.
2009-10-12T09:54:00.000Z	dsnyders	mb_again_	Okay.  Working flash drive on original port works.  Malfunctioning flash drive on different port still unable to fdisk.
