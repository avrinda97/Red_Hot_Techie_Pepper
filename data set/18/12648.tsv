2006-07-06T07:34:00.000Z	KenSentMe	fyrestrtr	too bad webmin isn't in the repos any more
2006-07-06T07:59:00.000Z	KenSentMe	fyrestrtr	has he been on WinXP all the time? No wonder cat doesn't work
2006-07-06T07:59:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	KenSentMe	yeah, its one for clientcopia
2006-08-10T14:57:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	KenSentMe	mplayer will do that, if you run it form the command line.
2006-08-10T14:58:00.000Z	KenSentMe	fyrestrtr	but isn't there a program that only does that?
2006-08-10T14:58:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	KenSentMe	mplayer -identify whatever.avi
2006-08-10T15:03:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	KenSentMe	file
2006-08-15T05:13:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	KenSentMe	bad feed?
2006-08-15T05:14:00.000Z	KenSentMe	fyrestrtr	i see that quite a lot, also with other feeds. Are they all bad feeds?
2006-08-15T05:15:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	KenSentMe	I'd have to look at the feed, but if they show up in another reader properly, then you know its the reader, not the feed.
2006-08-15T05:16:00.000Z	KenSentMe	fyrestrtr	you're right. I'll check that
2006-09-19T07:43:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	KenSentMe	no.
2006-09-19T07:44:00.000Z	KenSentMe	fyrestrtr	is there a way to give this device some standard rights?
2006-09-19T07:44:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	KenSentMe	devices don't have rights, what are you trying to do?
2006-09-19T07:46:00.000Z	KenSentMe	fyrestrtr	the /dev entry i mean. For Kino to use my firewire device the program has to have full rights to /dev/raw1394. This can be accomplished by running Kino as sudo or chmodding /dev/raw1394. But i'm looking for a permanent solution
2006-09-19T07:47:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	KenSentMe	you need to edit the udev configuration for that to work permanently.
2006-10-14T16:44:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	KenSentMe	default font for gnome-terminal is Monospace 9
