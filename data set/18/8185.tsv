2007-12-23T10:17:00.000Z	HardDisk	presto101	you really don't need envy.
2007-12-23T10:20:00.000Z	presto101	HardDisk	and Dr_willis so id trust the nexuiz benchmarks more than glx gears
2007-12-23T10:22:00.000Z	HardDisk	presto101	aye.
2007-12-23T10:22:00.000Z	HardDisk	presto101	speaking from a tux gamer myself :)
2007-12-23T10:22:00.000Z	presto101	HardDisk	thanks
2007-12-23T10:22:00.000Z	presto101	HardDisk	i was a bit worried after i had some trouble
2007-12-23T10:24:00.000Z	HardDisk	presto101	speaking of games I know this is offtopic, BUT..try alien arena, urban terror, frets on fire and gridwars
2007-12-23T10:25:00.000Z	presto101	HardDisk	ive tried most of those and like them quite a bit i mainly was useing nexuiz as a benchmark tool
2007-12-23T10:26:00.000Z	HardDisk	presto101	understandable.
2007-12-23T10:28:00.000Z	HardDisk	presto101	and I assume you are using the restricted drivers?
2007-12-23T10:28:00.000Z	presto101	HardDisk	yes the brand new ones
2007-12-23T10:28:00.000Z	HardDisk	presto101	then you should be fine, enjoy gaming :)
2007-12-23T10:31:00.000Z	HardDisk	presto101	I know run sudo nvidia-settings rather than nvidia-settings alone
2007-12-23T10:31:00.000Z	HardDisk	presto101	oh just ignore that
2007-12-23T10:39:00.000Z	presto101	HardDisk	so glxgears being lower is nothing to worry about correct?
2007-12-23T10:40:00.000Z	HardDisk	presto101	no. since glxgears is a fixed set of instructions. best way to benchmark is to use the games themselves like they do in the real world, when benchmarking videocards they base it on the actual games.
2007-12-23T10:44:00.000Z	presto101	HardDisk	thanks for your help and be back in a bit gang
