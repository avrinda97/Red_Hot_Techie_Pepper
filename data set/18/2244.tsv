2010-07-12T05:24:00.000Z	opty	Jordan_U	thanks :)
2010-07-12T05:24:00.000Z	Jordan_U	opty	You're welcome.
2010-07-12T05:25:00.000Z	opty	Jordan_U	 would that stuff work if i just wanted to transfer my ubuntu to the harddisk?
2010-07-12T05:25:00.000Z	Jordan_U	opty	Yes.
2010-07-12T05:26:00.000Z	opty	Jordan_U	do i need to install gparted just to resize the fs?
2010-07-12T05:27:00.000Z	opty	Jordan_U	or can i just install lvpm and do a resize?
2010-07-12T05:27:00.000Z	Jordan_U	opty	You'll need to boot from a liveCD/USB to do the resize.
2010-07-12T05:29:00.000Z	opty	Jordan_U	good point
2010-07-12T05:31:00.000Z	opty		has anyone got a nvidia gx 220 card?
2010-07-12T05:31:00.000Z	Jordan_U	opty	Wow, reading that page it appears that the standard way to do it does not require a LiveCD/USB, it creates a second (larger or smaller as you choose) copy of the virtual disk file then you reboot from the new resized file.
2010-07-12T05:31:00.000Z	opty		i dont have any hdmi audio :(
2010-07-12T05:32:00.000Z	Jordan_U	opty	I am fairly sure that you can do it faster with a LiveCD/USB though as you wouldn't need to copy all of the data.
2010-07-12T05:32:00.000Z	opty	Jordan_U	indeed
2010-07-12T05:33:00.000Z	opty		so im using Ubuntu-supplied Linux modules for version 2.6.32-22-generic ALSA snapshots from a ubuntu PPA dev
2010-07-12T05:33:00.000Z	opty		it shows up in sound as HDMI
2010-07-12T05:33:00.000Z	opty		but no sould
2010-07-12T05:34:00.000Z	Jordan_U	opty	Basically the way that I would do it would be to append as many GB of zeros to the file as you want using dd (*very* carefully, as a small mistake could whipe out all your data) then use ntfsresize.
