2011-10-19T00:05:00.000Z	saker		HELP!  I just upgraded from 11.04 to 11.10 and even though I enter the correct password I cannot restart my main user session (I had to start another session to get to x-chat to post here.).  When I click on my main user name and enter my password, the screen goes black and then returns me right back to the main menu.  Please help

2011-10-19T00:08:00.000Z	usr13	saker	Maybe there is a problem with the X server?

2011-10-19T00:10:00.000Z	saker		I have gnome and unity installed, but I used XFCE
2011-10-19T00:10:00.000Z	saker		but my problem is the same for all sessions
2011-10-19T00:12:00.000Z	usr13	saker	Ok, go to a console session, (Ctrl-Alt-F6) and run:  tail -f /var/log/messages and then Ctrl-Alt-F7 back to GUI,  log out and try to log back in as original user.  After failure, go back to tty6 ( Ctrl-ALt-F6 ) and see what clues there may be.
2011-10-19T00:13:00.000Z	usr13	saker	Look at the user's files and see that permissions are correct.  ls -l /home/user1
2011-10-19T00:14:00.000Z	usr13	saker	What is the name of the original user?
