2008-10-10T04:24:00.000Z	blak	deathtech	it would be useful to learn about it, chmod is really important to understand
2008-10-10T04:16:00.000Z	blak	deathtech	if it is working, what might be wrong, is drive mania working now?
2008-10-10T04:17:00.000Z	blak	deathtech	i would say that is fine then
2008-10-10T04:17:00.000Z	blak	deathtech	a lot of programs would require sudo to run, especially something that sounds like it does something with drives...?

2008-10-10T04:18:00.000Z	blak	deathtech	does the game load now? with sudo?.. i guess just use sudo, not that big of a deal?
2008-10-10T04:20:00.000Z	blak	deathtech	to install yes, to move depends no the chmod
2008-10-10T04:21:00.000Z	blak	deathtech	From my understanding a .sh is generally a script that if it does much of anything, will always need you to run it as root or (sudo)
2008-10-10T04:22:00.000Z	blak	deathtech	you could cat the .sh first and you would know where it wants to be
2008-10-10T04:23:00.000Z	deathtech	blak	: since im doing this manually will i also need to use CHmod then ?
2008-10-10T04:25:00.000Z	blak	deathtech	yea i know how that is, enjoy the ride with *nix
2008-10-10T04:27:00.000Z	deathtech	blak	: so if  i understand, chmod is simply permission administration ?
2008-10-10T04:28:00.000Z	blak	deathtech	this could be why you are having to use sudo all the time
2008-10-10T04:28:00.000Z	deathtech	blak	: thanks man, appreciate it :)
2008-10-10T04:32:00.000Z	blak	deathtech	lol, well you made a good choice, *nix is wayyy better for servers, pretty darn good for workstations
2008-10-10T04:38:00.000Z	deathtech	blak	: i started BBS'ing, and admining my own system at around 12 years old :p
