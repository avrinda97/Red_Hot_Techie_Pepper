2005-04-28T15:38:00.000Z	Shavnir		liable : Okay, so I copied the line of yours into my fstab.  Any recomandations as to where I should copy the mount command in case I need to remember it later?
2005-04-28T15:39:00.000Z	Shavnir		liable : I'm horrible about organization.  TO THE DESKTOP IT GOES!
2005-04-28T15:40:00.000Z	Shavnir		Oh okay
2005-04-28T15:40:00.000Z	Shavnir		In my fstab do I need a user flag or not?
2005-04-28T15:41:00.000Z	Shavnir		liable : Also do I want auto or noauto on my fstab entry?
2005-04-28T15:42:00.000Z	Shavnir		Okay.
2005-04-28T15:42:00.000Z	Shavnir		Oh crapsticks
2005-04-28T15:42:00.000Z	Shavnir		I don't have permission to modify my fstab
2005-04-28T15:43:00.000Z	Shavnir		What's the chmod to give me rw on a file?
2005-04-28T15:43:00.000Z	ompaul	Shavnir	you do it you type sudo vi /etc/fstab
2005-04-28T15:44:00.000Z	Shavnir	ompaul	: Dosen't help me much when I'm already pico'ing (although it put me in nano >_< ) the file. :(
2005-04-28T15:45:00.000Z	Shavnir	ompaul	: I learned pico 'cause it was the only one that worked with the backspace when being telnetted / ssh'ed to from a windows box.
2005-04-28T15:45:00.000Z	ompaul	Shavnir	well whatever you learnt you must use sudo to do the edit
2005-04-28T15:46:00.000Z	Shavnir		Okay
2005-04-28T15:46:00.000Z	Shavnir	ompaul	: That takes foresight, which I greatly lack, lol.
2005-04-28T15:47:00.000Z	ompaul	Shavnir	well here have a bottle of afterthought and do it again :)
2005-04-28T15:47:00.000Z	Shavnir	ompaul	: I used a shot of copy and paste between terminal windows myself. :)
