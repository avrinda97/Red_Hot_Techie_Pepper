2010-03-29T07:08:00.000Z	denis123		After upgrading (via update manager) on ubuntu it now fails by going to a blank black screen right after loading. I'm using xorg-edgers and a newer kernel (2.6.32) so that might be the problem? How could I fix this?\
2010-03-29T07:09:00.000Z	toogreen	denis123	what video card/chipset have u got?
2010-03-29T07:10:00.000Z	denis123	toogreen	[Radeon HD 4870] but it's not a hardware error as my dual boot windows works fine
2010-03-29T07:15:00.000Z	toogreen	denis123	I had the same problem with the same video card as yours happen today. It is a video card drivers problem. Reboot, then in the GRUB screen choose "safe mode" (2nd option)
2010-03-29T07:15:00.000Z	toogreen	denis123	then choose command line mode with networking
2010-03-29T07:15:00.000Z	denis123	toogreen	uh huh
2010-03-29T07:15:00.000Z	toogreen	denis123	then you need to use "envy" to re-install ATI's driver
2010-03-29T07:16:00.000Z	denis123	toogreen	is this the proprietory one? Because I'm using xorg edgers
2010-03-29T07:16:00.000Z	denis123	toogreen	the opensource ones
2010-03-29T07:16:00.000Z	toogreen	denis123	so type sudo aptitude install envyng
2010-03-29T07:17:00.000Z	toogreen	denis123	The "envy" program will allow you to reinstall your video card drivers easily from the console/command line
2010-03-29T07:17:00.000Z	toogreen	denis123	trust me I had exactly the same probably as you this morning and I fixed it that way
2010-03-29T07:18:00.000Z	denis123	toogreen	ah ok. so then just sudo aptitude envyng and follow the promps? Because I remember trying envy before using xorg edgers. And it stuffed me up
2010-03-29T07:18:00.000Z	toogreen	denis123	yeah after you install envy, type "envyng -t" to run the text version
2010-03-29T07:19:00.000Z	toogreen	denis123	then I chose "Install ATI drivers", then it recommend me to install one version of the driver, I don't remember which one it was but i just chose it by typing "0"
2010-03-29T07:20:00.000Z	denis123	toogreen	ok I'll give it a shot. Thanks!
2010-03-29T07:21:00.000Z	toogreen	denis123	np, I gotta run! Check this it might help too: http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-482592.html   - Good luck!
2010-03-29T07:21:00.000Z	denis123	toogreen	ok here I go. Thanks!
