2005-04-02T07:17:00.000Z	visor	kain	however it seems that only for booting because when shutdown it does show nothing but the plain text but yet it is still a hack not a finished thing
2005-04-02T07:17:00.000Z	kain	visor	yes, I read the related thread
2005-04-02T07:18:00.000Z	visor	kain	it doesnt install nothing else, you only need libfb, libstdc++ and another library i dont know, but yeah, you dont lose that much
