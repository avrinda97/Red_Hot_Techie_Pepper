2007-12-11T10:41:00.000Z	jones		how do i get rid of the joined and exit messages in x-chat?
2007-12-11T10:43:00.000Z	stroyan	jones	I removed those messages by using "settings"->"advanced"->"Text events" and changing the annoying messages to be empty.
2007-12-11T10:45:00.000Z	stroyan	jones	Perhaps you are using xchat-gnome instead of the full xchat package.  It has much less features.
2007-12-11T10:46:00.000Z	jones	stroyan	is that in the repo's? is x-chat the best? i am new here if u cant tell
2007-12-11T10:47:00.000Z	stroyan	jones	I started with xchat.  xchat-gnome felt wrong because it is 'different'.
2007-12-11T10:47:00.000Z	jones	stroyan	what is a good recommendation then?
2007-12-11T10:48:00.000Z	stroyan	jones	xchat-gnome is in 'main'  xchat is in 'universe'.  Use xchat-gnome if you like it.  Switch to xchat if it seems like something is missing.
2007-12-11T10:53:00.000Z	jones	stroyan	thanks i like xchat a lot better already. thanks
2007-12-11T10:53:00.000Z	stroyan	jones	you are welcome
2007-12-11T10:56:00.000Z	jones	stroyan	where did u say that the option was to turn of the join/exit message's? i looked in settings and did not see an option for it
2007-12-11T10:57:00.000Z	stroyan	jones	"settings"->"advanced"->"text events" has a dialog that sets what text to show for each of many events.
2007-12-11T11:13:00.000Z	stroyan	jones	I just installed nautilus-open-terminal and killed off the nautilus process.  Now right clicking on a folder icon has an "Open in terminal" option near the bottom of the pop-up menu.
2007-12-11T11:23:00.000Z	stroyan	jones	What kind of "remote file" are you looking at?  Something like "smb://hostname/dir" is not necessarily mounted anywhere.
2007-12-11T11:25:00.000Z	jones	stroyan	when i go to places-network i see my windows box and i am able to browse the files in nautilus. i want to look at these files via terminal
2007-12-11T11:29:00.000Z	stroyan	jones	Have a look at "man smbmount".  There may be a nice GUI way to mount a windows export.  I just edit /etc/fstab myself.  Something like "//host/SharedDocs /home/me/documents smbfs noauto,uid=me,gid=me,port=139,credentials=/home/me/credentials.txt,rw"
2007-12-11T11:39:00.000Z	jones	stroyan	thanks again. i knew that i could set up samba to see the files. i thought that since i was able to see them in nautilus that they would somehow already be setup for access via the terminal as well. does nautilus do something in the background to connect to these folders?
2007-12-11T11:41:00.000Z	stroyan	jones	Nautilus can use various remote access protocols and show the results to use as a folder.  You can use smb: to windows, or ftp: to an ftp server, etc.
2007-12-11T11:43:00.000Z	jones	stroyan	thanks for all the help this evening.
