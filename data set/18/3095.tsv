2010-05-21T13:14:00.000Z	sealive		ValueError: /usr/bin/python does not match the python default version. It must be reset to point to python2.6
2010-05-21T13:15:00.000Z	sealive		Where is the File that gives the value of the default Python to ubuntu on karmic?
2010-05-21T13:17:00.000Z	Severian	sealive	it is /usr/bin/python
2010-05-21T13:17:00.000Z	Severian	sealive	 It is just a symlink to the real python.
2010-05-21T13:18:00.000Z	sealive	Severian	So how do i fix this
2010-05-21T13:18:00.000Z	Severian	sealive	I don't know the problem.  fix what?
2010-05-21T13:23:00.000Z	Severian	sealive	There is a lot of traffic in this channel.  I don't know your root problem and so I answered what I saw you ask.
2010-05-21T13:24:00.000Z	sealive	Severian	i did talk to slimjimflim
2010-05-21T13:24:00.000Z	Severian	sealive	Are you ok now, then?
2010-05-21T13:29:00.000Z	Severian	sealive	  What do you get from      ls -l /usr/bin/python
2010-05-21T13:31:00.000Z	sealive	Severian	how is the command to link it against python2.6
2010-05-21T13:33:00.000Z	Severian	sealive	look at   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_link
2010-05-21T13:35:00.000Z	Severian	sealive	Is this computer running Karmic or Lucid.  Your symlink points to Python 2.5.  Even Jaunty used Python 2.6
2010-05-21T13:36:00.000Z	sealive	Severian	Karmicamd64
2010-05-21T13:36:00.000Z	Severian	sealive	reinstalling python may be a good idea.  What I'd worry about is what else is messed up.  Did your upgrade have visible problems?
2010-05-21T13:37:00.000Z	sealive	Severian	i now uninstall python like slimjimflim said
2010-05-21T13:38:00.000Z	Severian	sealive	That is scary.  You are probably removing things you need.
2010-05-21T13:41:00.000Z	Severian	sealive	Mark Shuttleworth is a python programmer.  Python is used for lots of things on Ubuntu and is a dependancy.  My guess is you will end up reinstalling, if you really did the uninstall.
