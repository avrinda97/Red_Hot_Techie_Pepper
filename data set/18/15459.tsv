2007-02-26T11:58:00.000Z	kalorin		I like linux boxes to have nice uptimes that are in the years
2007-02-26T11:58:00.000Z	cafuego_	kalorin	done
2007-02-26T12:00:00.000Z	cafuego_	kalorin	virtualise it
2007-03-01T11:34:00.000Z	cafuego_	kalorin	probably unused pages, is it using ram as cache still?
2007-03-01T11:35:00.000Z	cafuego_	kalorin	No, 14Mb free ram, 2Mb as buffer
2007-03-01T11:37:00.000Z	cafuego_	kalorin	Yeh, mine runs fine in 384Mb
2007-03-14T11:28:00.000Z	cafuego_	kalorin	multiple user/permissions support
2007-03-14T11:29:00.000Z	cafuego_	kalorin	Yes, but NFS on XP is not your friend.
2007-03-14T11:30:00.000Z	cafuego_	kalorin	Yeh, go samba (and cifs)
2007-03-14T11:30:00.000Z	cafuego_	kalorin	I have a setup like that and I;'ve just recently converted samba to use ldap, so I get single sign-on at home ;-)
