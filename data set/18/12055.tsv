2009-08-20T12:11:00.000Z	lillux		hello! im  unable to boot my ubuntu 9.04, grub told me error 22 no such partition....
2009-08-20T12:12:00.000Z	lillux		the live cd of ubuntu 8.04 told me that i have 2 media, the one with  ubuntu 9.04 and one little that i think is of ubuntu 8.04
2009-08-20T12:13:00.000Z	lillux		ok
2009-08-20T12:14:00.000Z	lillux		i have deleted ubuntu 8.04 so the  grub is drunk.....
2009-08-20T12:15:00.000Z	lillux		yes i think so
2009-08-20T12:15:00.000Z	Dextorion	lillux	if you deleted the linux partition you probably need to reset your MBR aswell. Do you run linux at all now?
2009-08-20T12:15:00.000Z	Dextorion	lillux	right. And on your harddrive?
2009-08-20T12:15:00.000Z	Dextorion	lillux	what do you have on your hard drive? Windows? Linux?
2009-08-20T12:18:00.000Z	Dextorion	lillux	so you have ubuntu 9.04 only. But it doesnt work.
2009-08-20T12:18:00.000Z	Dextorion	lillux	ok, and grub think you still have both.
2009-08-20T12:20:00.000Z	Dextorion	lillux	alright.. i guess first thing would be to edit your menu.lst. i belive dutchbuntu pasted a good link for you. lets see

2009-08-20T12:20:00.000Z	Dextorion	lillux	take a look at that one first. see if it can help you
2009-08-20T12:21:00.000Z	Dextorion	lillux	you will have to know what harddrive and what partition you have your ubuntu 9.04 on.
2009-08-20T12:22:00.000Z	Dextorion	lillux	ah.. your on a live cd. hm
2009-08-20T12:23:00.000Z	Dextorion	lillux	i guess you will have to mount your ubuntu 9.04 partition first.
2009-08-20T12:25:00.000Z	Dextorion	lillux	i dont think i ever used a live cd, im afraid i cant help you with that. Perhaps ActionParsnip or dutchbuntu can help you to edit menu.lst from the livecd.
2009-08-20T12:44:00.000Z	Dextorion	lillux	look in your media sda1 directory. do you have a boot directory in there now?
