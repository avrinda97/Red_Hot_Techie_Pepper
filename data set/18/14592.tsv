2005-07-05T10:49:00.000Z	Go0ro0	tigliona1bit	get off your high horse :p
2005-07-05T10:50:00.000Z	tigliona1bit	Go0ro0	It's not a horse, I'm just telling you it's not a lot to know how to use windows.  Everyone does
2005-07-05T10:50:00.000Z	tigliona1bit	Go0ro0	o really?  Say, can you tell me how I can get one?
2005-07-05T10:50:00.000Z	Go0ro0	tigliona1bit	sure, basic usage that's true
2005-07-05T10:50:00.000Z	Go0ro0	tigliona1bit	but troubleshooting systems is another thing
2005-07-05T10:51:00.000Z	Go0ro0	tigliona1bit	any random boob off the street can't do it
2005-07-05T10:51:00.000Z	tigliona1bit	Go0ro0	you just hack and slash with wizards
2005-07-05T10:51:00.000Z	Go0ro0	tigliona1bit	wizards? bleh
2005-07-05T10:51:00.000Z	Go0ro0	tigliona1bit	anyways, no point arguing that
2005-07-05T10:51:00.000Z	Go0ro0	tigliona1bit	well, my macintosh days ;)

2005-07-05T10:54:00.000Z	tigliona1bit	Go0ro0	you might want to start.  Here, read the rute book-- it's available off apt
2005-07-05T10:54:00.000Z	tigliona1bit	Go0ro0	nick-zap.home.comcast.net/stuff/unix.pdf  <-- here's a unix book I found helpful
2005-07-05T10:55:00.000Z	tigliona1bit	Go0ro0	you'll like debs.  They are nice
2005-07-05T10:55:00.000Z	tigliona1bit	Go0ro0	used apt a bit yet?
