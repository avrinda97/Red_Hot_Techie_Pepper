2009-02-02T07:58:00.000Z	david_		I was wondering why with the sysinfo utility my 2.20ghz dual core processor is being  reported 2x 1650 mhz, is this normal, i tried intel and the won't help me
2009-02-02T07:59:00.000Z	david_		shouldn't it be 2x 2.20ghz
2009-02-02T07:59:00.000Z	david_		ok thanks, i thought i got ripped off
2009-02-02T07:59:00.000Z	david_		hhahaha
2009-02-02T07:59:00.000Z	david_		thanx guys
2009-02-02T08:00:00.000Z	david_		what it that
2009-02-02T08:00:00.000Z	david_		ubuntu 8.10
2009-02-02T08:00:00.000Z	mjc	david_	cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep name
2009-02-02T07:59:00.000Z	mjc	david_	dual core means two processors in one package
2009-02-02T07:59:00.000Z	mjc	david_	that is perfectly fine
2009-02-02T07:59:00.000Z	mjc	david_	it could be that speedstep is in use
2009-02-02T07:59:00.000Z	mjc	david_	speedstep lowers CPU speed when idle
2009-02-02T08:00:00.000Z	mjc	david_	are you on windows or linux
2009-02-02T08:00:00.000Z	mjc	david_	that will tell you the model name and its real MHz
2009-02-02T08:00:00.000Z	mjc	david_	my c2d runs at 600MHz at idle and steps up to 2.66GHz when needed
2009-02-02T08:01:00.000Z	mjc	david_	model name is the way to know what its maximum speed is
2009-02-02T08:02:00.000Z	mjc	david_	then that is the correct speed, speedstep is active
2009-02-02T08:02:00.000Z	mjc	david_	do something processor intensive and you should see MHz go up to 2.2
