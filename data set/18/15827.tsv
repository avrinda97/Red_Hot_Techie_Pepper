2005-10-19T12:45:00.000Z	tenco		can someone help me with pdflatex and kpdf/xpdf?
2005-10-19T12:46:00.000Z	tenco		pdflatex with koma-script
2005-10-19T12:46:00.000Z	HappyFool	tenco	what's the problem?
2005-10-19T12:47:00.000Z	tenco	HappyFool	when i make pdf-files with pdflatex (and koma-script package), the fonts are displayed in an ugly way in kpdf and xpdf
2005-10-19T12:47:00.000Z	tenco	HappyFool	e.g. an "z" isnt as tall as an "u"
2005-10-19T12:47:00.000Z	tenco		*a
2005-10-19T12:48:00.000Z	tenco	HappyFool	so the text is displayed very bumpy
2005-10-19T12:48:00.000Z	HappyFool	tenco	hmm. maybe try 'acroread' instead, or ask in #latex for more
2005-10-19T12:48:00.000Z	tenco	HappyFool	*looks bumpy
2005-10-19T12:48:00.000Z	tenco	HappyFool	ok
2005-10-19T12:48:00.000Z	HappyFool	tenco	yeah, like ps2pdf sometimes does too
2005-10-19T12:49:00.000Z	tenco	HappyFool	but i used pdflatex directly. and its printed out with pretty fonts
2005-10-19T12:49:00.000Z	HappyFool	tenco	i'm not a texnician. but i know these font display issues happen fairly often
2005-10-19T12:50:00.000Z	tenco	HappyFool	so it must have sth to do with the kpdf/xpdf backend, because the cups backend seems to get it right
2005-10-19T12:50:00.000Z	HappyFool	tenco	the LaTeX faq discusses it too
2005-10-19T12:50:00.000Z	HappyFool	tenco	well, you might find acroread will display it funny but print it correctly -- that used to happen to me often
2005-10-19T12:50:00.000Z	tenco	HappyFool	ok. :) thx for your help, then.
2005-10-19T12:50:00.000Z	HappyFool	tenco	especially if using non-standard fonts, though this has gotten better lately
