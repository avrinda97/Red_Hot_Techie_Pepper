2006-11-16T09:20:00.000Z	highneko		How can I use my computer to login to another cmoputer and see everything like using two computers with one monitor?
2006-11-16T09:20:00.000Z	teledyn_	highneko	vnc is one way
2006-11-16T09:21:00.000Z	highneko	teledyn_	Ok, thanks.
2006-11-16T09:21:00.000Z	teledyn_	highneko	viewing a remote windows box from linux with vnc is usually ok, but i've always had problems trying to view another linux box via vnc
2006-11-16T09:30:00.000Z	highneko	teledyn_	When I use vncviewer and enter the remote password, I get a screen with lines on it and a cross cursor. Is this normal? What am I missing?
2006-11-16T09:31:00.000Z	teledyn_	highneko	that sounds like an x session with no window manager running
2006-11-16T09:32:00.000Z	highneko		I didn't specify a desktop on the remote machine, it jsut picked one. How do I know what one to use?
2006-11-16T09:32:00.000Z	teledyn_	highneko	any one you want
2006-11-16T09:32:00.000Z	highneko	teledyn_	I don't understand. What's this desktop perameter?
2006-11-16T09:33:00.000Z	teledyn_	highneko	what are you logging in to?  a linux box?
2006-11-16T09:33:00.000Z	highneko	teledyn_	yea
2006-11-16T09:33:00.000Z	teledyn_	highneko	and is it running x right now and a window manager?  kde or gnome or something?
2006-11-16T09:33:00.000Z	highneko	teledyn_	gnoem yea
2006-11-16T09:34:00.000Z	teledyn_	highneko	i don't know, i'm not a vnc expert.  sounds like you were able to connect.  i don't know why you don't see the gnome session
2006-11-16T09:35:00.000Z	highneko	teledyn_	When I try something it says "already running as :# I should probably logout and try that number.
2006-11-16T09:35:00.000Z	highneko	teledyn_	Thank you.
2006-11-16T09:40:00.000Z	highneko	teledyn_	I had to stop gdm. It worked by looked pretty bad. Was an interesting experience. Thank you.
2006-11-16T09:41:00.000Z	teledyn_	highneko	you might need to specify the resolution
