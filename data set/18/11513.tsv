2006-07-20T11:26:00.000Z	xipietotec		okay....it seems that only root has access to win32
2006-07-20T11:27:00.000Z	xipietotec		so how how do extract the codecs to win32 from the commandline?
2006-07-20T11:27:00.000Z	xipietotec		<----waaaayyyy new at linux
2006-07-20T11:27:00.000Z	xipietotec		there's a wiki?
2006-07-20T11:28:00.000Z	xipietotec		Um...actually I just downloaded the codecs.
2006-07-20T11:29:00.000Z	xipietotec		this is the package I installed, its on my desktop  essential-20060611.tar.bz2
2006-07-20T11:30:00.000Z	Seveas	xipietotec	delete that and download a w32codecs .deb file from mirror2.ubuntulinux.nl
2006-10-23T16:25:00.000Z	Seveas	xipietotec	try this: dpkg --configure -a
2006-10-23T16:26:00.000Z	Seveas	xipietotec	then apt-get -f install
2006-10-23T16:29:00.000Z	Seveas	xipietotec	then apt-get -f install
2006-10-23T16:29:00.000Z	Seveas	xipietotec	and paste the output at paste.ubuntu-nl.org please (pastebin.ca is almost unreadable, stupid black on blue)
2006-10-23T16:30:00.000Z	Seveas	xipietotec	fix
2006-10-23T16:34:00.000Z	Seveas	xipietotec	purge usplash-theme-kubuntu
2006-10-23T16:35:00.000Z	xipietotec	Seveas	thankyou! but how would kwin and kdesktop survive?
2006-10-23T16:35:00.000Z	Seveas	xipietotec	because they don't depend on kdm
2006-12-24T16:15:00.000Z	xipietotec	Seveas	do you know a program that will open .rpm archives for Ubuntu (not change them into .deb's like Alien, just open them like a normal archive)
2006-12-24T16:15:00.000Z	Seveas	xipietotec	file-roller (gnome) or ark (kde)
2007-10-18T14:06:00.000Z	xipietotec	Seveas	would you have any clue regarding this? My suspend isn't working, and I don't even think it has much to do with the nvidia binary...its not throwing up errors from the gpu or anything, it's just only putting 1 of my cpu's to sleep
