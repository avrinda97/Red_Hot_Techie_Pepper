2007-06-23T05:08:00.000Z	kitche	T-SubWoof	what do you mean by screwup?
2007-06-23T05:09:00.000Z	kitche	T-SubWoof	how did you install the game
2007-06-23T05:11:00.000Z	kitche	T-SubWoof	if you installed it that way then you have to find the uninstaller for it\
2007-06-23T05:12:00.000Z	kitche	T-SubWoof	since when you run a script like that ubuntu has nothing to do with it anymore
2007-06-23T05:12:00.000Z	kitche	T-SubWoof	most linux distros are like that since usually the .run file has a uninstall program just like in windows
2007-06-23T05:13:00.000Z	kitche	T-SubWoof	but any how ubuntu have a package for ufoai
2007-06-23T05:13:00.000Z	kitche	T-SubWoof	you have to run it the same way as you ran the .run script
2007-06-23T05:14:00.000Z	kitche	T-SubWoof	so you would do ./uninstall
2007-06-23T05:14:00.000Z	kitche	T-SubWoof	yes where did you install the game at
2007-06-23T05:17:00.000Z	kitche	T-SubWoof	ok go intoo /usr/local/games/Savage and see if it has an uninstall script in there
2007-06-23T05:17:00.000Z	kitche	T-SubWoof	ok so just run sudo ./uninstall
2007-06-23T05:18:00.000Z	kitche	T-SubWoof	your running it wrong
2007-06-23T05:19:00.000Z	kitche	T-SubWoof	sudo /usr/local/games/Savage/uninstall
2007-06-23T05:20:00.000Z	kitche	T-SubWoof	just delete the folder then that would work
2007-06-23T05:20:00.000Z	kitche	T-SubWoof	sudo
2007-06-23T05:22:00.000Z	kitche	T-SubWoof	umm your doing it wrong sudo rm -rf /usr/local/games/Savage
2007-06-23T05:22:00.000Z	kitche	T-SubWoof	be careful with rm -rf it can delete everything if you type the wrong path in
