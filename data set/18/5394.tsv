2009-08-10T23:05:00.000Z	MrPiracy	kattollikisd	did u try glxinfo?
2009-08-10T23:06:00.000Z	kattollikisd	MrPiracy	no, im a noob :S sorry for my actitud :S all check that soon hold on
2009-08-10T23:07:00.000Z	MrPiracy	kattollikisd	ok ... type "glxinfo" (without quotes) in a terminal window
2009-08-10T23:09:00.000Z	kattollikisd	MrPiracy	it show me a big list :S but i dont understand what dos means :S, but u think that i have the 2D driver if i just changed the driver
2009-08-10T23:10:00.000Z	MrPiracy	kattollikisd	try "glxinfo | grep render"
2009-08-10T23:11:00.000Z	MrPiracy	kattollikisd	it should filter the answer and it will display if you have any 3D accelerator driver workign
2009-08-10T23:12:00.000Z	kattollikisd	MrPiracy	here is the result of the 2 commando that u give me http://paste.ubuntu.com/250958/
2009-08-10T23:12:00.000Z	MrPiracy	kattollikisd	ok, let me look
2009-08-10T23:13:00.000Z	kattollikisd	MrPiracy	okey :)
2009-08-10T23:13:00.000Z	MrPiracy	kattollikisd	what graphic card do you have?
2009-08-10T23:16:00.000Z	kattollikisd	MrPiracy	when i installed ubuntu 9.04 the screen was really slow because the driver was Vesa, so i correct that problem and changed to the correct driver that the driver is a openchrome. tha card is a VIA Technologies, Inc. CN896/VN896/P4M900 [Chrome 9 HC] (rev 01)
2009-08-10T23:17:00.000Z	MrPiracy	kattollikisd	i have not experience with this card your using ... did u check their website for proper linux drivers?
2009-08-10T23:19:00.000Z	kattollikisd	MrPiracy	of yes. right now im in one here that is telling me about 2D driver to install it. but i would like to know if i alreally have the 2D driver. i can install the 3D becuase the speed of my card is a 256mb :S
2009-08-10T23:19:00.000Z	MrPiracy	kattollikisd	ohhh, i thought you wanted 3D acceleration, sorry
2009-08-10T23:20:00.000Z	MrPiracy	kattollikisd	well, at least it says you have direct rendering and OpenGL .... so i think you're fine
2009-08-10T23:21:00.000Z	kattollikisd	MrPiracy	jajaja it ok :) ohhh ok thanks :)
