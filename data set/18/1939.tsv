2010-10-19T05:26:00.000Z	onryo		You need to patch the VM
2010-10-19T05:27:00.000Z	onryo		both VMware, Xen and V.box all have this prob.
2010-10-19T05:27:00.000Z	onryo		try lsmod
2010-10-19T05:29:00.000Z	onryo		If your are using BackTrack is is very easy to see your driver just type "airmon"
2010-10-19T05:30:00.000Z	onryo		yeah whats up silentz0r
2010-10-19T05:31:00.000Z	onryo		silentzor nice card for the money with cuda to sport
2010-10-19T05:33:00.000Z	onryo		silentzor you are using the bleeding edge drivers. You are going to need the newer x.server
2010-10-19T05:34:00.000Z	onryo		I LOVE them the madwifi...they are not on the mac stack but still are kick ass
2010-10-19T05:36:00.000Z	onryo		for that card...not to mention you can also get the full cuda out of it for h.264 aka blu-ray
2010-10-19T05:37:00.000Z	onryo		but first I would get the x.server working with the info I gave you
2010-10-19T05:37:00.000Z	ezhangin	onryo	no offense to your card selection but i can do 1080p with a 9400 lol
2010-10-19T05:37:00.000Z	ezhangin		and that card is like $30-$40
2010-10-19T05:38:00.000Z	onryo	ezhangin	I got a 40 USD 290 Nvidia with just 16 cuda cores and I can watch 1900 HD
2010-10-19T05:38:00.000Z	onryo		and only use about 2% cpu as it is all moved to the GPU
2010-10-19T05:38:00.000Z	ezhangin	onryo	nice, i got this thing a few years back, didn't know that one was so cheap
2010-10-19T05:38:00.000Z	ezhangin	onryo	similar effects here
2010-10-19T05:39:00.000Z	ezhangin	onryo	well i would have similar effects if i had a working keyboard lol
2010-10-19T05:39:00.000Z	onryo	ezhangin	as long as it is newer then the 8800 cards it will work fine for h.264
