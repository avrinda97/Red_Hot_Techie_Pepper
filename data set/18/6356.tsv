2008-05-20T04:15:00.000Z	CarlC0X	amenado	TTreshoem worked fine last night. then i used apt-get to remove networkmanager. then i installed back networkmanager with apt-get as well... then worked fine... but today... i see this problem
2008-05-20T04:49:00.000Z	CarlC0X	amenado	its set for auto. i didnt mess with the IPs
2008-05-20T04:17:00.000Z	CarlC0X	amenado	the reason was having some problem while installing pidgin. and an error message said to disable network manager. and didnt work. so i removed it :)
2008-05-20T04:19:00.000Z	CarlC0X	amenado	yes i know the difference. but i just gived a try. i just want to start with linux. im a very newbie :)
2008-05-20T04:21:00.000Z	CarlC0X	amenado	i have asked a simple question., u can either help or not. no need to be ironic. ... and in order to learn things i dont need to make a fresh install for every little thing. im sure there must be a way around
2008-05-20T04:24:00.000Z	CarlC0X	amenado	its not my first install i assure u. i even installed debian and backtrack as well. i know how to install. now i just need to step ahead. so a fresh install wont help me. i need to learn how to fix things alright :)
2008-05-20T04:26:00.000Z	CarlC0X	amenado	making a fresh install for every failure isnt a solution. means ill have to reinstall 5 times a day? :)
2008-05-20T04:28:00.000Z	CarlC0X	amenado	i see ure a little bit ironic. but u should be. being more advanced in linux doesnt make you smarter. it just makes u linux advanced :)
2008-05-20T04:30:00.000Z	CarlC0X	amenado	following the installation wizard doesnt give me any feeling about whats going on with my network manager :)
2008-05-20T04:32:00.000Z	CarlC0X	amenado	yes i know its strange. but it worked last night after i re installed :)
2008-05-20T04:36:00.000Z	CarlC0X	amenado	yes host is fine, im using the host now. plus i can use wireless in ubuntu guest too
2008-05-20T04:38:00.000Z	CarlC0X	amenado	yup :)
2008-05-20T04:42:00.000Z	CarlC0X	amenado	yes works fine. i can get ubuntu online via wireless
2008-05-20T04:44:00.000Z	CarlC0X	amenado	im controlling the wireless from the ubuntu guest (the one which doesnt work otherwise)
2008-05-20T04:47:00.000Z	CarlC0X	amenado	rephrase please
2008-05-20T04:50:00.000Z	CarlC0X	amenado	tell me where to look at and ill check it out
2008-05-20T04:51:00.000Z	CarlC0X	amenado	host = vista, guest = ubuntu
