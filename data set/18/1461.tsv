2011-02-12T02:50:00.000Z	Abinadai	grazia	have you installed pulsaudio?
2011-02-12T02:50:00.000Z	grazia	Abinadai	i think
2011-02-12T02:52:00.000Z	Abinadai	grazia	after you install pulsedio you will see the controls for it by looking in Applications>>Sound and Video
2011-02-12T02:53:00.000Z	grazia	Abinadai	but pulse audio don't work
2011-02-12T02:54:00.000Z	grazia	Abinadai	pulseaudio "command no found"
2011-02-12T02:55:00.000Z	Abinadai	grazia	I don''t know how to help you any more because Im still new too.  Just reinstall pulseaudio from the software center
2011-02-12T02:55:00.000Z	grazia	Abinadai	pulseaudio E: pid.c: Daemon already running.
2011-02-12T02:55:00.000Z	Abinadai	grazia	that's wierd.
2011-02-12T02:55:00.000Z	grazia	Abinadai	thank you
2011-02-12T02:56:00.000Z	Abinadai	grazia	then you should see the server up on the area of the system tray an icon that lets you configure it.
2011-02-12T02:56:00.000Z	grazia	Abinadai	i wrong pulseaudio there is but when i run the command says E: pid.c: Daemon already running.
2011-02-12T02:58:00.000Z	grazia	Abinadai	there is a conflict, i think, with the daemon
2011-02-12T02:59:00.000Z	grazia	Abinadai	yes i understand, but what i do?
2011-02-12T03:00:00.000Z	Abinadai	grazia	just do some research like the bot says.  sound problems can be tricky to solve if you dont do the research
2011-02-12T03:00:00.000Z	grazia	Abinadai	 in hardware, preference audio, there aren't hardware
