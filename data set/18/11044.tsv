2006-09-21T06:42:00.000Z	ubunter		hi. i have a problem. i mounted windows partition to mnt/win but i can`t enter because of "acced denied"
2006-09-21T06:44:00.000Z	ubunter		when i type root and my pass it doesn`t work
2006-09-21T06:44:00.000Z	ubunter		in login screen
2006-09-21T06:45:00.000Z	stefg	ubunter	if it's ntfs, it's readonly by default, in case of fat32 you need the right mount-options in /etc/fstab... and forget about root, ubuntu does not work this way... see !root
2006-09-21T06:45:00.000Z	stefg	ubunter	the proper place would be /media/windows
2006-09-21T06:49:00.000Z	stefg	ubunter	that looks reasonable, but be aware: No way to safely write to ntfs in linux yet!
2006-09-21T06:50:00.000Z	ubunter	stefg	- but copying from ntfs to linux is durex?
2006-09-21T06:50:00.000Z	stefg	ubunter	yes reading ntfs works (and isn't dangerous, obviously)
2006-09-21T06:51:00.000Z	ubunter	stefg	- permission denied :/
2006-09-21T06:53:00.000Z	stefg	ubunter	use mount /dev/hd(foo,bar) -o nls=utf8,umask=007,gid=46 /media/windows
2006-09-21T06:56:00.000Z	ubunter	stefg	how to dismnout that previous first?
2006-09-21T06:57:00.000Z	stefg	ubunter	sudo umount /media/windows
2006-09-21T06:58:00.000Z	ubunter	stefg	works. someday i will be just like you
2006-09-21T07:01:00.000Z	stefg	ubunter	just like in 'that other OS'... right click -> properties -> open with :-)
2006-09-21T07:37:00.000Z	ubunter	stefg	no? ZA is not a fwall? O_o
2006-09-21T07:57:00.000Z	stefg	ubunter	are you behind a hardware router?
2006-09-21T09:01:00.000Z	stefg	ubunter	call it by gksudo guarddog
2006-09-21T09:02:00.000Z	ubunter	stefg	- my bad. thanks
