2008-11-27T05:12:00.000Z	Brandano	toastedmilk	not listed in lsusb?
2008-11-27T05:13:00.000Z	toastedmilk	Brandano	yes, but I unmounted it in gconf-editor and now I need the default value for the key
2008-11-27T05:13:00.000Z	toastedmilk	Brandano	I already tried clearing the value, and that doesn't work
2008-11-27T05:14:00.000Z	toastedmilk	Brandano	it's current value is 'disk', but that isn't working with Songbird
2008-11-27T05:14:00.000Z	Brandano	toastedmilk	ptobably needs a different entry in the device list. Odd, though
2008-11-27T05:15:00.000Z	toastedmilk	Brandano	Do you have an ipod?  What is it's mount value?
2008-11-27T05:15:00.000Z	Brandano	toastedmilk	not an ipod, different make
2008-11-27T05:16:00.000Z	toastedmilk	Brandano	does it load into /media/disk ?
2008-11-27T05:17:00.000Z	toastedmilk	Brandano	Will you open gconf-editor and tell me the mount_point value?
2008-11-27T05:19:00.000Z	Brandano	toastedmilk	as I said, with the Creative players it doesn't work like that, it won't show them as a storage device
2008-11-27T05:21:00.000Z	Brandano	toastedmilk	lsusb in my case returns "Bus 001 Device 011: ID 041e:413e Creative Technology, Ltd"  for the player
2008-11-27T05:21:00.000Z	toastedmilk	Brandano	yes, but that tells me neither the device name or the device type
2008-11-27T05:23:00.000Z	Brandano	toastedmilk	can you connect to the ipod via one of the media players? Amarok for example?
2008-11-27T05:25:00.000Z	toastedmilk	Brandano	no, because in Amarok you have to have the ipod mounted at /mnt/ipod, which caused my initial problems to begin with
2008-11-27T05:25:00.000Z	Brandano	toastedmilk	try escaping it? \/
2008-11-27T05:25:00.000Z	toastedmilk	Brandano	what?
2008-11-27T05:26:00.000Z	Brandano	toastedmilk	bash takes as escape character the \ symbol
