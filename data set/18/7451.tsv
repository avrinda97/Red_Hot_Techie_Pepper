2008-01-12T04:40:00.000Z	nickrud	Eagle2160	see DrMitch
2008-01-12T04:42:00.000Z	nickrud	Eagle2160	any install is 'from scratch'
2008-01-12T04:43:00.000Z	Eagle2160	nickrud	and drmitch i installed it but it completely messed up and did not fully install i need to start the install over again but it does not have an option to do that how the heck do i install it correctly?
2008-01-12T04:43:00.000Z	nickrud	Eagle2160	but before you start the new install: if you had problems with the last, run the disc check
2008-01-12T04:43:00.000Z	nickrud	Eagle2160	just tell it to install, it will start all over from the beginning
2008-01-12T04:44:00.000Z	Eagle2160	nickrud	it does not have that option
2008-01-12T04:44:00.000Z	nickrud	Eagle2160	when you tell it to install, it will start at the beginning, as if you had never installed before
2008-01-12T04:45:00.000Z	Eagle2160	nickrud	ok first of all it does not have that option second of all i have tryed that atleast 5 times already and it is not working!
2008-01-12T04:45:00.000Z	nickrud	Eagle2160	then maybe you have a bad disk. Did you run the disk check utility on the startup screen?
2008-01-12T04:46:00.000Z	Eagle2160	nickrud	yes it is a good disk but all the option on there say start and install or just boot but it will not install from the begining
2008-01-12T04:46:00.000Z	nickrud	Eagle2160	Some machines have problems installing from the live cd. You may have to try the alternate one from releases.ubuntu.com/7.10
2008-01-12T04:47:00.000Z	Eagle2160	nickrud	no all i need to do is install it from the begining how do i do that the cd is working fine all i need to do is restart it from the begining
2008-01-12T04:48:00.000Z	nickrud	Eagle2160	it boots to the live cd desktop?  Double click the Install Icon. If that does not work, your machine won't install from the live cd, and you will need the alternate
2008-01-12T04:49:00.000Z	Eagle2160	nickrud	it will not install like that because the original install did not completely install correctly about half waay through it quit out i just need to start it from scratch again
2008-01-12T04:49:00.000Z	nickrud	Eagle2160	you are not listening. Double clicking that starts it from scratch.
