2011-03-06T08:02:00.000Z	dv310p3r	bazhang	because when trying to install the latest xchat in says I need glib

2011-03-06T08:03:00.000Z	dv310p3r	bazhang	from the website
2011-03-06T08:03:00.000Z	bazhang	dv310p3r	that is not a good idea. stick with package management
2011-03-06T08:03:00.000Z	dv310p3r	bazhang	apparently theres a bug in the version that I have that when I add channels to my favorites they don't stay

2011-03-06T08:05:00.000Z	dv310p3r	bazhang	ok, how should I do it.
2011-03-06T08:05:00.000Z	bazhang	dv310p3r	edit the server and add there, separated by a comma
2011-03-06T08:05:00.000Z	dv310p3r	bazhang	also, is there an easier way to respond directly to you, other than having to retype your name each time.
2011-03-06T08:06:00.000Z	bazhang	dv310p3r	tab complete, set to last spoken and not alpahbetical baz <tab> will do it
2011-03-06T08:06:00.000Z	dv310p3r	bazhang	like that.
