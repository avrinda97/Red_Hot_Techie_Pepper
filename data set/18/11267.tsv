2006-09-15T15:56:00.000Z	lupine_85	kitche	git is the "GNU interactive tools"...
2006-09-15T15:56:00.000Z	kitche	lupine_85	well the thing that you want is called git as well
2006-09-15T15:58:00.000Z	kitche	lupine_85	cogito is an overlay of git
2006-09-29T05:38:00.000Z	kitche	lupine_85	the s means sticky I believe in permissions
2006-09-29T05:38:00.000Z	lupine_85	kitche	any idea how to set it using chmod?  :)
2006-09-29T05:40:00.000Z	kitche	lupine_85	I do but can't really look it up since I m in class right now
2006-09-29T05:41:00.000Z	kitche	lupine_85	should be chmod -s though to get rid of the sticky
2006-09-29T05:43:00.000Z	kitche	lupine_85	but jerrcs should look at /etc/passwd and the /etc/shadow file to make sure their perms are right
2006-09-29T05:56:00.000Z	lupine_85	kitche	I don't think the madwifi drivers support usb :(
2006-11-04T06:40:00.000Z	kitche	lupine_85	yes but you will have a multi-lib system
2006-11-04T06:41:00.000Z	kitche	lupine_85	you need 64 bit libs for everything
2006-11-04T06:41:00.000Z	kitche	lupine_85	but I know people that run 64-bit and 32bit at the same time so it can be done
2006-12-21T14:57:00.000Z	kitche	lupine_85	well the best compression that I found is lzma but it's not widely used
2007-02-10T11:57:00.000Z	lupine_85	kitche	is it?
2007-02-10T11:58:00.000Z	kitche	lupine_85	ljl just said it :) a few lines ago
2007-02-10T12:00:00.000Z	lupine_85	kitche	I just uploaded it - for the unofficial repo
