2005-11-02T07:54:00.000Z	mustard5	sorush20	something like this http://www.legitreviews.com/article.php?aid=247
2005-11-02T07:57:00.000Z	mustard5	sorush20	you still around? did you see the keyboard at the link I showed you?  That looks like what you are after
2005-11-05T12:17:00.000Z	mustard5	sorush20	just started happening?  if not, what changed since it was working?
2005-11-05T12:19:00.000Z	sorush20	mustard5	 sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't I think I have sused out what the problem is .. I have a printer hotpluged ... I also have other things attached.. I make sure that I have only the printer and the hotplug restart command goes as far as stopping but is unable to restart back up?
2005-11-05T12:20:00.000Z	mustard5	sorush20	hmmm..annoying
2005-11-05T12:20:00.000Z	mustard5	sorush20	not really sure what to do though
2005-11-05T12:23:00.000Z	mustard5	sorush20	I wonder whether something would show up in your /var/logs that might help troubleshoot
2005-11-05T12:24:00.000Z	mustard5	sorush20	I can only think of simple commands like lsusb for listing usb devices :)
2005-12-06T17:54:00.000Z	mustard5	sorush20	I'm just looking up what error 15 is
2005-12-06T17:55:00.000Z	sorush20	mustard5	I think its to do with not being able to find the map etc..
2005-12-06T17:56:00.000Z	mustard5	sorush20	it says its a file not found error
