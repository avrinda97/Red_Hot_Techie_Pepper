2008-04-26T06:03:00.000Z	gravemind		oh ok
2008-04-26T06:05:00.000Z	gravemind		hmm well for some reason the dpkg command isn't working, do you want to manually edit your xorg.conf or try something else
2008-04-26T06:07:00.000Z	josh04	gravemind	dpkg-reconfigure doesn't reconfigure graphics drivers any more : /
2008-04-26T06:07:00.000Z	gravemind	josh04	oh.. d'oh
2008-04-26T06:07:00.000Z	josh04	gravemind	I think it's an issue, not a feature. At least, I'd hope :P I posted in the bug report aobut it a few days ago
2008-04-26T06:08:00.000Z	gravemind	josh04	whew, I'm glad we're working on getting it fixed tho
2008-04-26T06:21:00.000Z	josh04	gravemind	No-one ever knows how to fix my problems :P
2008-04-26T06:22:00.000Z	gravemind	josh04	aww, that sucks
2008-04-26T06:23:00.000Z	josh04	gravemind	I have a shortlist of problems since last december which refuse to budge an inch :P
2008-04-26T06:24:00.000Z	gravemind	josh04	I had one like that, feisty broke my cd drive, it has never been fixed since
2008-04-26T06:25:00.000Z	josh04	gravemind	I can trump that :P When I come back from hibernate with a reasonably cool laptop, the temperature sensors and ergo the fan don't fire up :P
2008-04-26T06:26:00.000Z	gravemind	josh04	ooh, then goodbye cool laptop
2008-04-26T06:26:00.000Z	josh04	gravemind	goodbye all laptop if I'm not carefull :P
2008-04-26T06:27:00.000Z	gravemind	josh04	you might just have to give up the luxury of hibernate, unless it's really important to you
2008-04-26T06:28:00.000Z	josh04	gravemind	Hibernate's useful because I dual boot and have to swap between the two a lot. I can hibernate both ubuntu and vista and never have to open firefox again :P
2008-04-26T06:28:00.000Z	gravemind	josh04	ah that's a good point
2008-04-26T06:29:00.000Z	josh04	gravemind	It'd be okay if sleep worked, but that hangs on resume the _second_ time I do it : / obscure errors ftw
2008-04-26T06:29:00.000Z	josh04	gravemind	and of course there's no way to debug sleep
