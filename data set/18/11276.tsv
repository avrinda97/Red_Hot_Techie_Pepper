2006-08-21T08:01:00.000Z	qid		does anyone know how to get WPA-PSK for wireless connections working in ubuntu 6.06?
2006-08-21T08:01:00.000Z	tnzr	qid	what card?
2006-08-21T08:02:00.000Z	qid	tnzr	not sure, it's a Centrino system
2006-08-21T08:02:00.000Z	tnzr	qid	dell?
2006-08-21T08:03:00.000Z	tnzr	qid	check out /usr/share/doc/wpasupplicant/examples/
2006-08-21T08:04:00.000Z	tnzr	qid	you probably want the wpa-psk-tkip.conf file.. copy it to /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf and edit it to your liking
2006-08-21T08:04:00.000Z	tnzr	qid	once you've done that you can try to fire it up:  sudo wpa_supplicant -B -c /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf -D wext -i eth1 -dd    <-- assuming your card is eth1
2006-08-21T08:06:00.000Z	qid	tnzr	thanks, I'll give that a shot
2006-08-21T08:13:00.000Z	qid	tnzr	it worked, although I had to re-enter the gateway for some reason
2006-08-21T08:14:00.000Z	tnzr	qid	so you can ping & stuff now?
2006-08-21T08:14:00.000Z	qid	tnzr	what's involved in switching back and forth between a WPA network and a WEP network? do I just kill the wpa_supplicant daemon manually?
2006-08-21T08:14:00.000Z	qid	tnzr	yeah, it works
2006-08-21T08:15:00.000Z	tnzr	qid	if you find that after disconnecting, you cant reconnect, do this (I have to on my ipw2200):  sudo wpa_cli remove keys ; sudo wpa_cli reconfigure
2006-08-21T08:15:00.000Z	tnzr	qid	the program you were talking about earlier, network manager does that I believe..
2006-08-21T08:16:00.000Z	tnzr	qid	I dont use it so im not sure where to tell you to configure the networks that it chooses between, but it may look in wpa_supplicant.conf.. if not maybe it scans and uses the scan results
2006-08-21T08:16:00.000Z	tnzr	qid	---^
2006-08-21T08:17:00.000Z	tnzr	qid	type iw<tab a couple of times> to see a list of wireless command line tools
2006-08-21T08:18:00.000Z	tnzr	qid	if you run wpa_cli you can type help at its prompt and do a bunch of stuff in there too
