2008-07-17T23:49:00.000Z	bullgard4	sheep	I will consider your advise.
2008-07-17T23:48:00.000Z	sheep	bullgard4	if it's casuing problems with irc and you aren't running an ident daemon, try blocking it
2008-07-17T23:51:00.000Z	bullgard4	sheep	I could install the DEB program package pidentd. Will this cause a noticable load to my 1.8 GHz Ubuntu laptop?
2008-07-17T23:52:00.000Z	sheep	bullgard4	I don't think it would use very much memory or cpu, although I use oidentd not pidentd
2008-07-17T23:52:00.000Z	bullgard4	sheep	ok.
2008-12-24T20:03:00.000Z	sheep	bullgard4	according to man mailcap, it's the metaMAIL CAPabilities file
2008-12-24T20:04:00.000Z	bullgard4	sheep	Ah! --  Thank you very much for explaining. (I should have read the manpage. But I did not know that there exists one.)
2009-01-18T16:42:00.000Z	sheep	bullgard4	it stores your user's personal mime info database which includes which programs are associated with which mime types
2009-01-18T16:48:00.000Z	bullgard4	sheep	How does your statement comply with the statement in /etc/mailcap: "Users can add their own rules if they wish by creating a ".mailcap" file in their home directory"?
2009-01-18T16:49:00.000Z	sheep	bullgard4	what do you mean by that?
2009-01-18T16:53:00.000Z	bullgard4	sheep	Your statement and the file's statement contradict each other.
2009-01-18T16:53:00.000Z	sheep	bullgard4	mailcap and mimeinfo.cache are unrelated
2009-01-18T16:55:00.000Z	bullgard4	sheep	I do not think so. See Synaptic about the DEB program package 'mime-support'. --  Can you prove your statement: " mailcap and mimeinfo.cache are unrelated".
2009-01-18T16:57:00.000Z	sheep	bullgard4	I'm confused. What do you mean by "How does your statement complu with the statement in /etc/mailcap?"
2009-01-18T17:01:00.000Z	bullgard4	sheep	Basically, /etc/mailcap says that personal MIME information should be put ~/.mailcap. You told me that personal MIME information is put in ~/.local/share/applications/mimeinfo.cache. This are two different files.
2009-01-18T17:01:00.000Z	sheep	bullgard4	they can be put in either
2009-01-18T17:01:00.000Z	sheep	bullgard4	some programs will check mailcap files, others will check the mimeinfo.cache files
2009-01-18T17:02:00.000Z	bullgard4	sheep	Ah, ok. --  Thank you very much for explaining.
