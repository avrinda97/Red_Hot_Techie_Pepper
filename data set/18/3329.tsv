2010-03-30T08:08:00.000Z	Gnea	meowbuntu	so reinstall it
2010-03-30T08:09:00.000Z	Gnea	meowbuntu	this prevents you from using apt how?
2010-03-30T08:09:00.000Z	meowbuntu	Gnea	i cant get onto the internet
2010-03-30T08:12:00.000Z	Gnea	meowbuntu	export http_proxy=http://yourproxyaddress:proxyport
2010-03-30T08:12:00.000Z	Gnea	meowbuntu	then use apt-get
2010-03-30T08:13:00.000Z	Gnea	meowbuntu	or add the following line to /etc/apt/apt.conf: Acquire::http::Proxy "http://yourproxyaddress:proxyport";
2010-03-30T08:14:00.000Z	meowbuntu	Gnea	my proxy address needs to be reset to default null
2010-03-30T08:14:00.000Z	Gnea	meowbuntu	I'm just saying, that's where you put it to make it work
2010-03-30T08:17:00.000Z	Gnea	meowbuntu	then we are done talking
2010-03-30T08:18:00.000Z	meowbuntu	Gnea	yes i installed squid andset it up then i removed squid and now i cant access download apps cause it is looking for the proxy address that is not there anymore
2010-03-30T08:20:00.000Z	meowbuntu	Gnea	yes i eant the default address that was using before i install squid
2010-03-30T08:20:00.000Z	Gnea	meowbuntu	I have no idea what that was.
2010-03-30T08:20:00.000Z	Gnea	meowbuntu	why don't you just reinstall squid?
2010-03-30T08:22:00.000Z	meowbuntu	Gnea	stop please listen i am now repeating what i hve told you. i canot use apt becaues it is set to look for the proxy that squid was managing. but it cant find it
