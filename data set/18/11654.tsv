2006-07-03T12:34:00.000Z	nooseisloose		the computer thaT  doesnt' work's
2006-07-03T12:36:00.000Z	nooseisloose		is the mac on the router?
2006-07-03T12:37:00.000Z	nooseisloose		macintosh
2006-07-03T12:37:00.000Z	nooseisloose		got a console open?
2006-07-03T12:37:00.000Z	nooseisloose		yes
2006-07-03T12:38:00.000Z	nooseisloose		what's the ip on the macintosh?
2006-07-03T12:39:00.000Z	nooseisloose		and the router's ip?
2006-07-03T12:40:00.000Z	nooseisloose		if you open a terminal on the macintosh and say ifconfig it says 67.182.202.36?
2006-07-03T12:41:00.000Z	nooseisloose		you may have to give route add default gw 192.168.1.1 dev eth0
2006-07-03T12:41:00.000Z	nooseisloose		where eth0 is your ethernet card
2006-07-03T12:41:00.000Z	sethk	nooseisloose	no, not for this purpose
2006-07-03T12:42:00.000Z	sethk	nooseisloose	no routing is required for communication among machines on the same subnet
2006-07-03T12:42:00.000Z	nooseisloose		he just said they were not on the same subnet
2006-07-03T12:42:00.000Z	nooseisloose	sethk	67.182.202.36 192.168.1.1
2006-07-03T12:42:00.000Z	sethk	nooseisloose	then he can't configure from a box on another subnet
2006-07-03T12:43:00.000Z	nooseisloose		seth is he doing that?
2006-07-03T12:43:00.000Z	sethk	nooseisloose	well, by now we are all thoroughly confused.  What he was asking originally is how to set up his ubuntu box so he can use it to configure his linksys router
2006-07-03T12:44:00.000Z	nooseisloose	sethk	alink, so what are the facts?
