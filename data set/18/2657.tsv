2010-03-27T16:55:00.000Z	harishz		how do i make the display changes permanent
2010-03-27T16:57:00.000Z	harishz		i just set my display settings to 1440x900...every time i logout, the display settings come back to 800x600
2010-03-27T16:57:00.000Z	harishz		not sure why this happens
2010-03-27T16:57:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	harishz	Video card?
2010-03-27T16:57:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	harishz	sudo lshw -C video
2010-03-27T16:59:00.000Z	harishz	LinuxGuy2009	i have nvidia GeForce 7300
2010-03-27T17:00:00.000Z	harishz	LinuxGuy2009	what should i do to make my display settings permanent
2010-03-27T17:01:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	harishz	Do you have a nvidia restricted driver installed?
2010-03-27T17:01:00.000Z	harishz	LinuxGuy2009	yes
2010-03-27T17:01:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	harishz	Hmm which one?
2010-03-27T17:02:00.000Z	harishz	LinuxGuy2009	i have 185.18.36
2010-03-27T17:02:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	harishz	hmm strange
2010-03-27T17:03:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	harishz	Maybe try the one from nvidia.com but doubt it will make any difference.
2010-03-27T17:03:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	harishz	Could be a driver bug or ubuntu bug too.
2010-03-27T17:03:00.000Z	harishz	LinuxGuy2009	i did try to install directly from nvidia.com..and i had great difficulty...thought i will mess it up and installed through package manager
2010-03-27T17:04:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	harishz	understandable
2010-03-27T17:04:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	harishz	Could file a bug report or see if others have had issues with that card.
2010-03-27T17:05:00.000Z	harishz	LinuxGuy2009	sure....thanks
