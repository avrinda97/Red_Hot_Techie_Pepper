2007-06-01T05:44:00.000Z	ikonia	ubuntuEdgy	scp
2007-06-13T14:41:00.000Z	ikonia	ubuntuEdgy	you can't pipe top
2007-06-13T14:41:00.000Z	ubuntuEdgy	ikonia	thanks for your wisdom
2007-06-13T14:45:00.000Z	ikonia	ubuntuEdgy	just ping the computer - if it doesn't repond shut down
2007-06-13T14:46:00.000Z	ikonia	ubuntuEdgy	so its not turned off
2007-06-13T14:48:00.000Z	ikonia	ubuntuEdgy	that won't work
2007-06-13T14:51:00.000Z	ubuntuEdgy	ikonia	i get it working
2007-07-30T13:41:00.000Z	ikonia	ubuntuEdgy	make sure you have reverse name server resolution
2007-07-30T13:41:00.000Z	ikonia	ubuntuEdgy	use nfs V4
2007-07-30T13:43:00.000Z	ikonia	ubuntuEdgy	NFS4 is in the kernel
2007-07-30T13:44:00.000Z	ikonia	ubuntuEdgy	name resolution can be fixed on the local lan with the hosts file on each box
2007-07-30T13:45:00.000Z	ubuntuEdgy	ikonia	thanks im going to  try and find out more about this
2007-07-30T13:46:00.000Z	ubuntuEdgy	ikonia	my nfs files are mounted when i boot btw
2007-07-30T13:47:00.000Z	ikonia	ubuntuEdgy	that shouldn't be a problem
2007-07-30T13:48:00.000Z	ubuntuEdgy	ikonia	its fast with 1GB files but very slow with 7 and up
2007-07-30T13:49:00.000Z	ikonia	ubuntuEdgy	check for NFSV4
2007-07-30T13:49:00.000Z	ikonia	ubuntuEdgy	also check for your revser lookup - it will effect it more on a bigger file (more lookups)
