2007-06-02T05:21:00.000Z	premier_		I just ran apt-get update, and I got a few warnings... the last one said: "E: Some index files failed to download, they have been ignored, or old ones used instead."
2007-06-02T05:22:00.000Z	premier_		W: Duplicate sources.list entry http://security.ubuntu.com feisty-security/restricted Packages (/var/lib/apt/lists/security.ubu               dists_feisty-security_restricted_binary-i386_Packages)
2007-06-02T05:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U	premier_	Did you edit your sources.list by hand or with a script?
2007-06-02T05:23:00.000Z	premier_	Jordan_U	well, I used to edit it by hand, but since edgy, its been weird
2007-06-02T05:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U	premier_	Can you pastebin your sources.list ?
2007-06-02T05:25:00.000Z	premier_	Jordan_U	http://pastebin.ca/529524
2007-06-02T05:30:00.000Z	premier_	Jordan_U	are you going to make a suggestion for my sources list?
2007-06-02T05:32:00.000Z	Jordan_U	premier_	Other than line 39 and 41 being the same is looks fine, one of the repos might have just been temporarily down
2007-06-02T05:33:00.000Z	premier_	Jordan_U	well, I keep getting broken downloads and warnings from apt-get... synaptic just waits and waits for downloads that never come
2007-06-02T05:35:00.000Z	Jordan_U	premier_	Do you need the repo from cl.naist.jp ? since I have never heard of it I don't know if it is reliable or not
2007-06-02T05:36:00.000Z	premier_	Jordan_U	maybe not... trying to remember what that is... it might be CJK language support
2007-06-02T05:49:00.000Z	Jordan_U	premier_	You need to remove the noacpi option from the automagic kernel config section in your /boot/grub/menu.list
2007-06-02T05:50:00.000Z	premier_	Jordan_U	I know that, its just, it does it without telling me, then I have to go and fix it... but only after I've booted it into noacpi mode
2007-06-02T05:50:00.000Z	premier_	Jordan_U	I want it to stop messing with my head
2007-06-02T05:51:00.000Z	Jordan_U	premier_	Can you post your /boot/grub/menu.lst ?
2007-06-02T05:51:00.000Z	Jordan_U	premier_	*pastebin your menu.lst*
2007-06-02T05:53:00.000Z	premier_	Jordan_U	http://pastebin.ca/529576
2007-06-02T05:55:00.000Z	Jordan_U	premier_	look at line 88, that is where Ubuntu looks for what kernel parameters should be added when the menu.lst is updated
