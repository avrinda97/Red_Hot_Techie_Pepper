2006-08-22T13:34:00.000Z	kolla|wrk		Im thinking of installing ubuntu on my future laptop, though i'm not sure does the "free program download" utility has the programs i need. Is there anywhere i can see them?
2006-08-22T13:34:00.000Z	kolla|wrk		there is some text on the website "Need more software? You can choose from hundreds of software packages in the Ubuntu software catalogue, all available to download and install with the click of a button. And it's all completely free."
2006-08-22T13:35:00.000Z	kolla|wrk		ok thanks

2006-08-22T13:38:00.000Z	kolla|wrk	mcrandello	you've used inkscape on ubuntu?
2006-08-22T13:38:00.000Z	mcrandello	kolla|wrk	used it a bit on win32 a while back, practically the same program both places
2006-08-22T13:39:00.000Z	mcrandello	kolla|wrk	afaik it's like inkscap is to Draw as the gimp is to photoshop
2006-08-22T13:40:00.000Z	mcrandello	kolla|wrk	there was a KDE project called Karbon14 I think they renamed it but I forget to what :(
2006-08-22T13:40:00.000Z	mcrandello	kolla|wrk	also a draw type program
2006-08-22T13:41:00.000Z	kolla|wrk	mcrandello	oki.. I'l check this inkspace.. Im just abit worried that my boss wont be able to open files :D
2006-08-22T13:42:00.000Z	mcrandello	kolla|wrk	it is probably the most beginner freindly one out there atm
2006-08-22T13:43:00.000Z	kolla|wrk	mcrandello	ok cool.
2006-08-22T13:43:00.000Z	mcrandello	kolla|wrk	of course I reccomend getting the kubuntu livecd :)
2006-08-22T13:43:00.000Z	kolla|wrk	mcrandello	why's that?
2006-08-22T13:44:00.000Z	kolla|wrk	mcrandello	there's some good manuals, right?
2006-08-22T13:44:00.000Z	mcrandello	kolla|wrk	I'm more of a KDE person myself
2006-08-22T13:44:00.000Z	mcrandello	kolla|wrk	also the ubuntu forums, this channel on irc and #kubuntu as well
