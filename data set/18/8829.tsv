2007-12-11T12:48:00.000Z	tich		has anyone had any problems with ubuntu freezing when playing a 3d game in full screen mode?
2007-12-11T12:48:00.000Z	desertc	tich	no...  what graphics driver are you using?
2007-12-11T12:48:00.000Z	tich		nvidia
2007-12-11T12:49:00.000Z	desertc		hmm!
2007-12-11T12:49:00.000Z	desertc		what game?
2007-12-11T12:50:00.000Z	desertc		!hi | j1solutions
2007-12-11T12:51:00.000Z	tich	desertc	it happens with world of padman, assault cube, sauerbraten and it used to happen in nexius.
2007-12-11T12:51:00.000Z	tich		and probably a couple others.
2007-12-11T12:52:00.000Z	desertc	tich	Are you using the ubuntu supplied driver?
2007-12-11T12:53:00.000Z	desertc	tich	or did you go and try Envy or something
2007-12-11T12:55:00.000Z	tich	desertc	it leaves fullscreen mode and becomes a window but the mouse and sometimes the keyboard are locked up.  i can ctrl+alt+f1-->top to kill it and everything is fine.... i installed the beta from the website.
2007-12-11T12:55:00.000Z	desertc	tich	Oh, I have seen that.  Turn off your screensaver
2007-12-11T12:55:00.000Z	desertc	tich	Your computer thinks it is idle
2007-12-11T12:56:00.000Z	tich	desertc	really!  that is amazing and wonderfully simple.  a thousand thank yous
2007-12-11T12:56:00.000Z	desertc	tich	then, when it is closing the game, it sees your mouse and jumps back
2007-12-11T12:56:00.000Z	tich		of course that makes sense.
2007-12-11T12:56:00.000Z	desertc	tich	Just be sure to come back to #ubuntu and help someone else sometime.
2007-12-11T12:56:00.000Z	desertc	tich	Happy gaming, and have fun.
