2006-06-09T15:36:00.000Z	icheyne	uXp	gtk is GTK+ (Gimp Tool Kit), a graphical toolkit.  You probably want to "apt-get install libgtk1.2-dev", or now at version 2, which may be installed with "apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev". libgtk1.2 is GTK+, libgtk2.0 is GTK2.  They are NOT compatible.  They are totally separate..
