2005-10-03T14:43:00.000Z	henk		good morning...
2005-10-03T14:44:00.000Z	henk		I have my desktop set up pretty good now, what whould i need to display and use it remotely on a windows box. (@ work that is)
2005-10-03T14:45:00.000Z	jamey3	henk	turn on "Remote Desktop" then make sure the port is forwarded
2005-10-03T14:45:00.000Z	jamey3	henk	make sure you put a password on it too
2005-10-03T14:45:00.000Z	henk	jamey3	i was more talking about the client side
2005-10-03T14:45:00.000Z	henk		i found the remote desktop thing, but now what :)
2005-10-03T14:45:00.000Z	jamey3	henk	oh right well just use some sort of VNC viewer, e.g. WinVNC or TightVNC
2005-10-03T14:45:00.000Z	jamey3	henk	tick the first checkbox and enter a password at the bottom
2005-10-03T14:45:00.000Z	henk		ah ok any recomendations ?
2005-10-03T14:46:00.000Z	henk		or should just try 'm out
2005-10-03T14:46:00.000Z	jamey3	henk	yeah both are pretty good, setting their options so that it works at a reasonable speed is the difficult bit
2005-10-03T14:47:00.000Z	jamey3		woops
2005-10-03T14:47:00.000Z	henk		hmm the passwordfield is limited to 8 chars... wierd
2005-10-03T14:48:00.000Z	jamey3	henk	yeah I've only just noticed that :)
2005-10-03T14:48:00.000Z	jamey3	henk	you might want to untick "Ask for confirmation"
2005-10-03T14:48:00.000Z	henk		i did already
2005-10-03T14:48:00.000Z	jamey3		k
