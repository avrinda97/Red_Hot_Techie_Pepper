2011-02-17T10:59:00.000Z	andrew__		how hot should components get inside my computer?
2011-02-17T11:00:00.000Z	JeffCBR	andrew__	CPUs can get to well over 120 degrees.
2011-02-17T11:01:00.000Z	andrew__	JeffCBR	you talking C or F
2011-02-17T11:01:00.000Z	JeffCBR		Not C!
2011-02-17T11:01:00.000Z	JeffCBR		Jeez...
2011-02-17T11:01:00.000Z	JeffCBR		F.
2011-02-17T11:01:00.000Z	andrew__	JeffCBR	mines idling at 52 C... could that be why my comp keeps shuting off
2011-02-17T11:02:00.000Z	JeffCBR		An overheating CPU can cause that.
2011-02-17T11:02:00.000Z	JeffCBR		I don't know what 52 C is in F.
2011-02-17T11:02:00.000Z	JeffCBR		But, it doesn't sound too high.
2011-02-17T11:02:00.000Z	andrew__	JeffCBR	its ~120ish
2011-02-17T11:03:00.000Z	JeffCBR		I would think that's not it, andrew__ .
2011-02-17T11:03:00.000Z	andrew__	JeffCBR	hmmm im running it without GUI and a minecraft server
2011-02-17T11:04:00.000Z	JeffCBR		In the summer here in SoCal, I can overheat sometimes.
2011-02-17T11:04:00.000Z	JeffCBR		I used to have to make sure not to keep the CPU going at full bore for very long.
2011-02-17T11:05:00.000Z	JeffCBR	andrew__	You CPU will get hotter with higher loads, obviously.
2011-02-17T11:05:00.000Z	JeffCBR		Can you monitor the temperature and stress it?
2011-02-17T11:05:00.000Z	andrew__	JeffCBR	its my gfx card, i think
