2005-04-24T11:25:00.000Z	cens0red		back. neither wvdial nor pon will work, because apparantly I have no such device as "/dev/modem". What do I need to set up?
2005-04-24T11:26:00.000Z	thoreauputic	cens0red	make a link from /dec/ttyS0 or whichever serial port you use to /dev/modem
2005-04-24T11:27:00.000Z	thoreauputic	cens0red	 ln -s /dev/ttyS0 /dev/modem
2005-04-24T11:27:00.000Z	thoreauputic	cens0red	that requires sudo, of course
2005-04-24T11:27:00.000Z	cens0red	thoreauputic	 aah. Thankyou. That's all I need to do? *is wasting 25cents every time he reconnects*
2005-04-24T11:28:00.000Z	thoreauputic	cens0red	should work - make sure it *is* ttyS0 and not, say, ttyS1
2005-04-24T11:29:00.000Z	cens0red	thoreauputic	according to the "network settings" utility in the System menu, my modem is on /dev/ttyS1. Substitute accordingly?
2005-04-24T11:29:00.000Z	thoreauputic	cens0red	yes
2005-04-24T11:30:00.000Z	thoreauputic	cens0red	sudo ln -s /dev/ttyS1 /dev/modem
2005-04-24T11:31:00.000Z	thoreauputic	cens0red	also make sure the user is in dialout and dip groups
2005-04-24T11:31:00.000Z	thoreauputic	cens0red	and I would suggest using the pppconfig utility to set up the connection
2005-04-25T05:43:00.000Z	thoreauputic	cens0red	if it's installed, do dpkg -S <package>
2005-04-25T05:44:00.000Z	cens0red	thoreauputic	yep that works too. ty.
2005-04-27T07:17:00.000Z	thoreauputic	cens0red	alsa is standard with 2.6.* kernels
2005-04-27T07:18:00.000Z	cens0red	thoreauputic	how do I tell which one I've got?
2005-04-27T07:18:00.000Z	thoreauputic	cens0red	you definitely have alsa
