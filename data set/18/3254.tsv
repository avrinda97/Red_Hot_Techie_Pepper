2011-10-31T06:32:00.000Z	semitones		what program can I use to look at the beginning of a binary file?
2011-10-31T06:32:00.000Z	semitones		I tried opening it in Kate (32MB) and it crashed my system
2011-10-31T06:33:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	semitones	it *crashed* your whole system? Whoa...
2011-10-31T06:34:00.000Z	semitones	Stereocaulon	yeah I had to go to tty1 (which took forever) and kill kate and virtuoso-t whatever that is
2011-10-31T06:35:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	semitones	yes, that's the proper invocation
2011-10-31T06:36:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	semitones	maybe, you can use a generic binary viewer and pipe that to head?
2011-10-31T06:38:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	semitones	try od (octal dump), or x(x)d to perform a hex-dump
2011-10-31T06:41:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	semitones	od <file>|head works wonderfully here
2011-10-31T06:42:00.000Z	semitones	Stereocaulon	great! I will try it now
2011-10-31T06:42:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	semitones	xd is not in the Ubuntu distro, but od is...
2011-10-31T06:43:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	semitones	yes, what did you expect, did you want ascii chars?
2011-10-31T06:43:00.000Z	semitones	Stereocaulon	any idea what the 172340000 value is about?
2011-10-31T06:43:00.000Z	semitones	Stereocaulon	I'm just trying to interpret the output
2011-10-31T06:43:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	semitones	not the foggiest, especially since you did not tell me what kind of file it is.
2011-10-31T06:44:00.000Z	semitones	Stereocaulon	my goal here is to see if dd is succeeding in writing to NAND storage of a USB drive
2011-10-31T06:44:00.000Z	semitones	Stereocaulon	this is a binary dump of the usb drive (unformatted)
2011-10-31T06:45:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	semitones	private chat? This is a bit offtopic.
2011-10-31T06:45:00.000Z	semitones	Stereocaulon	sure -- i am just trying to use ubuntu to accomplish a thing
