2007-04-24T05:48:00.000Z	ahave		could someone point me in the right direction for mounting a ntfs drive over a network?
2007-04-24T05:49:00.000Z	HOT	ahave	smbmount -t ntfs blahblah
2007-04-24T05:49:00.000Z	ahave	HOT	ty will google submount
2007-04-24T05:49:00.000Z	HOT	ahave	or if you prefer gui then just select "location" > "network"
2007-04-24T05:50:00.000Z	HOT		sorry places > location > network
2007-04-24T05:50:00.000Z	ahave	HOT	using the GUI method.. how do i actually mount it?
2007-04-24T05:51:00.000Z	ahave	HOT	I am trying to add the drive so that programs on my linux box can see the drive over the network
2007-04-24T05:51:00.000Z	HOT		ahave:so a perm connection? you need to use mount then or smbmount
2007-04-24T05:52:00.000Z	HOT	ahave	the gui is just a "one off" connection, altough you can bookmark it
2007-04-24T05:52:00.000Z	ahave	HOT	do you know of a link that i can read up on?
2007-04-24T05:52:00.000Z	ahave	HOT	I am new to linux
2007-04-24T05:52:00.000Z	HOT	ahave	a simple example of a connection is "smbmount -t ntsf //server/share /mnt/myshare -o username=spongebob,password=squarepants
2007-04-24T05:53:00.000Z	HOT	ahave	that may look a bit scarey but if you break it down its very straight forward
2007-04-24T05:53:00.000Z	ahave	HOT	what goes inplace of //server/share ?
2007-04-24T05:54:00.000Z	HOT	ahave	lets say the machine you are connecting to is called banana and the shared folder is on c:\fruit the full path would be \\banana\fruit make sense?
2007-04-24T05:56:00.000Z	HOT	ahave	the next part \mnt\share says "i want you to mount the directory in the folder /mnt/share" however you may need to make that directory "mkdir /mnt/share"
2007-04-24T05:57:00.000Z	HOT	ahave	the final part is the username and password you want to connect to the share as so -o username=administrator,password=supersecret
2007-04-24T05:58:00.000Z	HOT	ahave	finally :) the start part "-t ntfs" says i want to mount the filetype ntfs, if you wanted FAT you would do "-t fat" or ext3 "-t ext3" hope that makes sense
