2005-11-07T06:01:00.000Z	NoUse	rick_	did your upgrade to breezy finish successfully?
2005-11-07T06:02:00.000Z	NoUse	rick_	what does sudo apt-get dist-upgrade say?
2005-11-07T06:05:00.000Z	NoUse	rick_	you rebooted since you upgraded?
2005-11-07T06:05:00.000Z	NoUse	rick_	you might just want to do a fresh install
2005-11-07T06:06:00.000Z	NoUse	rick_	can you put your sources.list in pastebin?
2005-11-07T06:06:00.000Z	NoUse	rick_	read what ubotu sent you
2005-11-07T06:09:00.000Z	NoUse	rick_	you can use gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
2005-11-07T06:12:00.000Z	NoUse	rick_	yeah I think you might need to do a fresh install
2005-11-07T06:12:00.000Z	NoUse	rick_	cause automatix broke something and I can't figure out what
2005-11-07T06:15:00.000Z	NoUse	rick_	yeah I'd suggest sticking to the normal ways of upgrading ubuntu
2005-11-07T06:15:00.000Z	NoUse	rick_	you can try
2005-11-07T06:17:00.000Z	NoUse	rick_	sure good luck
2005-11-07T16:15:00.000Z	NoUse	rick_	what?
2005-11-07T16:17:00.000Z	NoUse	rick_	nothing looks out of order there
