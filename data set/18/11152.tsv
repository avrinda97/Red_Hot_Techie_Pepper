2006-09-03T05:34:00.000Z	hightowe1	neutrinomass	thanks for helping. can you narrow the "ls- l .*" for some directories? i've tonns of .* dirs ;)
2006-09-03T05:36:00.000Z	neutrinomass	hightowe1	Ok.... I'm not sure but you probably have to delete (hint: don't delete anything, I might be wrong - just rename): a directory beginning with .gtk or some .qt-gtk-engine or something similar ...
2006-09-03T05:36:00.000Z	hightowe1	neutrinomass	ok, trying...
2006-09-03T05:37:00.000Z	neutrinomass	hightowe1	Don't delete, rename, and remember its previous name :P
2006-09-03T05:39:00.000Z	hightowe1	neutrinomass	problem solved! removed .gtkrc-2.0 and error is gone. THANKS!

2006-09-03T05:40:00.000Z	neutrinomass	hightowe1	"GTK+ apps don't work after upgrading from kubuntu breezy" or something like that, include the output of the gtk apps and mention how you fixed it
