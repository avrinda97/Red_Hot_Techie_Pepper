2012-02-07T02:09:00.000Z	leeping__		Hi there, something's wrong with my desktop.  I want to restart my desktop manager, but I really don't want to restart the computer.  I already tried restarting lightdm but that didn't restore the desktop to its 'fresh' state.  Any other suggestions?
2012-02-07T02:09:00.000Z	celestius	leeping__	log out and log back in?
2012-02-07T02:10:00.000Z	leeping__	celestius	I'm worried I'll lose my background processes (the ones that i started from the command line)
2012-02-07T02:10:00.000Z	leeping__	celestius	i haven't logged out yet
2012-02-07T02:13:00.000Z	leeping__	celestius	let me try. i'll be back
2012-02-07T02:14:00.000Z	leeping__	celestius	I'm back, my screen window hasn't crashed but my windows still aren't behaving properly
2012-02-07T02:16:00.000Z	leeping__	celestius	check out this screenshot:
2012-02-07T02:17:00.000Z	leeping__	celestius	I might have it, what is the name of the package (or the program that i run to open the window)?
2012-02-07T02:18:00.000Z	celestius	leeping__	the package is called compizconfig-settings-manager
2012-02-07T02:18:00.000Z	leeping__	celestius	i just installed it
2012-02-07T02:20:00.000Z	leeping__	celestius	i see, i thought it was a tool I could've used to fix something :)
2012-02-07T02:20:00.000Z	celestius	leeping__	can you give me the output of ls -a ~ ?
2012-02-07T02:21:00.000Z	leeping__	celestius	http://paste.ubuntu.com/831916/
2012-02-07T02:23:00.000Z	leeping__	celestius	sure
2012-02-07T02:25:00.000Z	leeping__	celestius	I just moved the files in compiz-1 to another place
2012-02-07T02:28:00.000Z	leeping__	celestius	you're not gonna believe this, i hit suspend instead of log out by accident, and then i couldn't resume, so i rebooted :P
2012-02-07T02:29:00.000Z	leeping__	celestius	email still doesn't work.
2012-02-07T02:32:00.000Z	leeping__	celestius	yeah, Thunderbird is nice. :) I don't remember why i didn't switch over complete
