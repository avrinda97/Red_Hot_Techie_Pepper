2012-07-02T06:29:00.000Z	CIDR		Hrmm after a clean install, when I goto boot up it just sits at a pink/purple screen.  If I ctrl+alt+delete the next time it boots it goes to the grubs creen, then I hit enter and it boots.  But I have to boot once, then ctrl+alt+delete to get it to boot.  any ideas?
2012-07-02T06:30:00.000Z	escott	CIDR	if you hit the up arrow does it say anything useful
2012-07-02T06:30:00.000Z	CIDR	escott	no?
2012-07-02T06:48:00.000Z	escott	CIDR	then check the logs
2012-07-02T06:48:00.000Z	CIDR	escott	what logs?
2012-07-02T06:49:00.000Z	CIDR	escott	like the system isn't even booting yet I don't thin.  Magic sysrq does nothing
2012-07-02T06:49:00.000Z	escott	CIDR	kern.log, xorg
2012-07-02T06:49:00.000Z	escott	CIDR	i thought you had the purple plymouth splash? is it the purple grub?
2012-07-02T06:50:00.000Z	escott	CIDR	well that would point to a bios issue
2012-07-02T07:02:00.000Z	escott	CIDR	is the bootloader on the hardware raid
2012-07-02T07:02:00.000Z	CIDR	escott	yes
2012-07-02T07:03:00.000Z	escott	CIDR	i wonder if that is just taking some time to come up from a cold start
2012-07-03T02:26:00.000Z	escott	CIDR	what country are you in?
2012-07-03T02:27:00.000Z	escott	CIDR	pirate it from europe :)
2012-07-03T02:27:00.000Z	escott	CIDR	in truth getting cable is going to be a pain. most providers don't like to give you the card you need to decrypt
2012-07-03T02:29:00.000Z	escott	CIDR	if you are happy with unencrypted or analog then thats fine
2012-07-03T02:31:00.000Z	escott	CIDR	the v4l project is the place to go for information on hardware http://linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page
2012-07-03T02:31:00.000Z	escott	CIDR	they can also point you at software
