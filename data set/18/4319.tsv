2009-04-30T07:29:00.000Z	evalsaidem		can anyone ping us.archive.ubuntu.com.....
2009-04-30T07:30:00.000Z	raylu	evalsaidem	run "host us.archive.ubuntu.com" and you'll realize there are multiple servers
2009-04-30T07:30:00.000Z	evalsaidem	raylu	I do that and I get 91.189.88.40
2009-04-30T07:31:00.000Z	evalsaidem		but when I run apt-get install it just hangs....
2009-04-30T07:31:00.000Z	raylu	evalsaidem	er... you should get a few others...
2009-04-30T07:31:00.000Z	raylu	evalsaidem	host just does a dns resolution. i was just pointing out that there are multiple servers so telling us to ping one doesn't do much
2009-04-30T07:31:00.000Z	evalsaidem		oh
2009-04-30T07:31:00.000Z	evalsaidem		how can I set my dns servers?
2009-04-30T07:31:00.000Z	evalsaidem		maybe they are failing me...
2009-04-30T07:32:00.000Z	evalsaidem		or I don't have any set up...
2009-04-30T07:32:00.000Z	raylu	evalsaidem	you certainly have one set up. you only see one ip when using "host us.archive.ubuntu.com"?
2009-04-30T07:32:00.000Z	evalsaidem		raylu
2009-04-30T07:32:00.000Z	evalsaidem	raylu	right 91.189.88.40
2009-04-30T07:33:00.000Z	raylu	evalsaidem	strange. consider changing your server to http://mirror.anl.gov/ubuntu/. it's a server in the US; you can make the change in /etc/apt/sources.list
2009-04-30T07:33:00.000Z	raylu		!compiz | mstone
2009-04-30T07:33:00.000Z	evalsaidem		thanks will give it a try
2009-04-30T07:34:00.000Z	evalsaidem	raylu	after changing thatdo I have run anything so ubuntu know to load the file over again?
2009-04-30T07:36:00.000Z	evalsaidem	raylu	 now I am getting:  host http://mirror.anl.gov/ubuntu/
