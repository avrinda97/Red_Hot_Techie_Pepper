2006-07-26T13:13:00.000Z	vortexvein		johnny - I had this same problem, I used a different linux disc to erase the partition and then used ubuntu installation again and it worked
2006-07-26T13:13:00.000Z	vortexvein		try what I did Johnny
2006-07-26T13:14:00.000Z	vortexvein		oh, another thing I tried to do, Johnny, was that instead of using the entire disc for a new partition
2006-07-26T13:14:00.000Z	vortexvein		I left alot of free space behind
2006-07-26T13:14:00.000Z	vortexvein		and then thats what finally worked
2006-07-26T13:15:00.000Z	vortexvein		i gave ubuntu only 20 gigs
