2006-03-17T15:10:00.000Z	jimm1		Hiya - I'm having real trouble mounting my old HDD- I've bought a new one and installed ubuntu on it, ive connected my old one to the secondary IDE cable, I want to mount my old ubuntu partition so i can get my old data off, could someone give me a hand?
2006-03-17T15:11:00.000Z	Mosi	jimm1	what's the problem?
2006-03-17T15:12:00.000Z	Mosi	jimm1	are you trying to get it to automount, or are you just trying to mount it?
2006-03-17T15:14:00.000Z	jimm1	Mosi	can you help me get my secondary ide hdd mounted?
2006-03-17T15:15:00.000Z	Mosi	jimm1	do you know how to use the mount command?
2006-03-17T15:18:00.000Z	Mosi	jimm1	the third letter of the name of the device file (hdAx, hdBx, etc) is the one that indicates which physical drive. while the number (hda1, hda2, hda3, etc) points to the partition on that drive. try 'sudo mount -t <filesystem type> /dev/hdb0 /mnt'
2006-03-17T15:19:00.000Z	Mosi	jimm1	yes
2006-03-17T15:20:00.000Z	Mosi	jimm1	if your ubuntu partition is the only ext3 partiion on the drive, you can try by trial and error ifyou don't know... i.e. specify '-t ext3' in the mount command and do all the partitions one at a time. if it's not ext3 it should exit 1 and you can try again
2006-03-17T15:23:00.000Z	jimm1	Mosi	sudo mount -t ext3 /dev/hdb3 /mnt  =  the current hdd and partition im using!
2006-03-17T15:25:00.000Z	jimm1	Mosi	i've now got my current active ubuntu partition mounted twice, one in / and the other in /mnt  - how do i get rid of the one i've just mounted in /mnt?
2006-03-17T15:26:00.000Z	Mosi	jimm1	sudo umount /mnt
2006-03-17T15:28:00.000Z	jimm1	Mosi	that worked - its not in /mnt anymore - how can I find out which hd my second hard drive is? (we established hdb = my current hdd)
2006-03-17T15:28:00.000Z	Mosi	jimm1	if hdb is your current hard drive, try hda then O_o
2006-03-17T15:29:00.000Z	jimm1	Mosi	i found it - hdc!
2006-03-17T15:29:00.000Z	Mosi	jimm1	cool :)
2006-03-17T15:29:00.000Z	Mosi	jimm1	no worries :P
2006-03-17T15:29:00.000Z	Mosi	jimm1	if you want you can add it to /etc/fstab so it automounts when your system boots up
2006-03-17T15:32:00.000Z	Mosi	jimm1	it's pretty easy, let me know if you want help ^_^
