2012-02-06T08:46:00.000Z	quixotedon	ActionParsnip	and i can't find the reason why people don't like unity, because for a newbie like me, it's just something better than the other two famous OS
2012-02-06T08:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	quixotedon	you don't have to use it, people don't like many parts of their OS (I always strip out Firefox), and its all changable
