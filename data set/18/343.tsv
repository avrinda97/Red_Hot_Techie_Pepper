2012-05-01T01:30:00.000Z	JessicaW		anyone know how to kill a failed installation?
2012-05-01T01:30:00.000Z	JessicaW		kill -9 isn't working
2012-05-01T01:30:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	JessicaW	Then it's dead. Reboot.
2012-05-01T01:31:00.000Z	JessicaW	Psi-Jack	wow... srsly?
2012-05-01T01:31:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	JessicaW	Please use the English langauge when talking to me. 'u', 'pls', 'thx', for example, are properly spelled 'you', 'please', and 'thanks'.
2012-05-01T01:32:00.000Z	JessicaW	Psi-Jack	so you're saying, if kill -9 doesn't work my only option is to reboot?
2012-05-01T01:32:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	JessicaW	Generally speaking, yes.
2012-05-01T01:32:00.000Z	JessicaW	Psi-Jack	what if rebooting is not an option at this time... is there any other way? I've got 18 tb of data being parsed right now.
2012-05-01T01:33:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	JessicaW	Wait, and then reboot?
2012-05-01T01:33:00.000Z	JessicaW	Psi-Jack	I'll have to wait until friday. Will this negatively impact the machine in any way? 10.04 server.
2012-05-01T01:34:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	JessicaW	Of course it /could/ impact it. It really depends though on what the actuall process it.
2012-05-01T01:34:00.000Z	JessicaW	Psi-Jack	root     29112  0.0  0.0  89644 76384 ?        Ds   13:52   0:00 /usr/bin/dpkg --status-fd 23 --unpack --auto-deconfigure /var/cache/apt/archives/tree_1.5.3-1_amd64.deb
2012-05-01T01:36:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	JessicaW	Yeah, that looks to be in an uninteruptable sleep. So it's pretty much doing nothing.
2012-05-01T01:37:00.000Z	JessicaW	Psi-Jack	well... It was worth a shot.
2012-05-01T01:40:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	JessicaW	Really? HUP worked? Very odd.
2012-05-01T01:40:00.000Z	JessicaW	Psi-Jack	I'm not sure why.
2012-05-01T01:41:00.000Z	JessicaW	Psi-Jack	it just completed the interrupted installation with apt-get install -f
2012-05-01T01:42:00.000Z	JessicaW	Psi-Jack	or not... it's giving errors. Lovely. dpkg: warning: files list file for package `tree' missing, assuming package has no files currently installed.
