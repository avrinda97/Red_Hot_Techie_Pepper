2008-05-08T22:17:00.000Z	jimdb		I asked at one point how to do a clean install of 8.04 without loosing my 7.10 home folder.  someone said to just mount the volume and delete everything but the home folder. Can someone tell me how to do that?
2008-05-08T22:19:00.000Z	jimdb		mimi:  look at the fstab.  also locate and install the ntfs 3g configuration via synaptic.

2008-05-08T22:21:00.000Z	jimdb		mimi:  i said look at it.  but i then said check out the NTFS 3g configuration utility by installing it via synaptic.
2008-05-08T22:21:00.000Z	jimdb		mimi:  when you run that tool and set it up, it makes entries in the fstab
2008-05-08T22:22:00.000Z	jimdb		mimi:  and those are what is necessary to have the volume mounted upon start up.
2008-05-08T22:22:00.000Z	jimdb		mimi:  if that doesn't work you should run the ntfs tools package to run a check against the ntfs volume.  there's a flag that is not set when the volume is not unmounted properly.
2008-05-08T22:24:00.000Z	jimdb		mimi:  it is called ntfsprogs
2008-05-08T22:25:00.000Z	jimdb		mimi:  read the description before you install it.  it lists the various utilities that it installs
2008-05-08T22:25:00.000Z	gnyffel	jimdb	not ntfs-config?
2008-05-08T22:26:00.000Z	jimdb	gnyffel	 ntfs-config allows him to set up the fstab using a gui.  but it won't address the issues of the ntfs mount flag being improperly set.
2008-05-08T22:30:00.000Z	gnyffel	jimdb	isn't it ntfsfix without the hyphen, though?
2008-05-08T22:32:00.000Z	jimdb	gnyffel	 if you go back into synaptic and you look at the ntfsprogs entry, then read the description, you'll see the list of utilities.
2008-05-08T22:32:00.000Z	gnyffel	jimdb	I've only had problems having ntfs-3g mount volumes when the ntfs volume hadn't been unmounted cleanly
2008-05-08T22:34:00.000Z	jimdb	gnyffel	 i understand....the ntfsprogs is the set of utilities designed to help you resolve the unclean mount issue.  you also have the choice of connecting that drive to an windows box and unmounting it that way.
2008-05-08T22:34:00.000Z	gnyffel	jimdb	I realise that ntfsprogs pulls several utilities, it's just that ntfsfix in particular is invoked without the hyphen. I think.
2008-05-08T22:35:00.000Z	jimdb	gnyffel	 just try both and find out which one lists that it needs parameters and which one tells you that it can't find the program you are trying to invoke
2008-05-08T22:35:00.000Z	gnyffel	jimdb	only I don't think it was brought up that the volume had been unmounted badly. Might've missed it
