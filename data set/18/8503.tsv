2007-11-26T01:35:00.000Z	killroy_2		question: I want to buy either a USB or PCMCIA NIC for my lappy.  I am looking for recommendations for a product that is known to work well with gutsy
2007-11-26T01:35:00.000Z	Tidus	killroy_2	the netgear FA120 usb wired ethernet works fine
2007-11-26T01:36:00.000Z	killroy_2	Tidus	sorry, I meant to state that I need wireless
2007-11-26T01:36:00.000Z	Tidus	killroy_2	oh.  my linksys WPC54GS works fine with ndiswrapper
2007-11-26T01:38:00.000Z	killroy_2	Tidus	see, now, my lappy has an Intel PRO wireless 2100 but I'm getting a firmware issue, so I have a WPC54G ver 4.0 PCMCIA but I can't get the system to recognize it.  I've installed drivers with ndiswrapper and ran the modprobe, but I never get a device.  Of course, I haven't turned off the internal nic.  What might I be doing wrong?  Can you recommend a link to assist with setup?
2007-11-26T01:38:00.000Z	Tidus	killroy_2	that should be TI ACX chipset
2007-11-26T01:39:00.000Z	Tidus	killroy_2	my other pcmcia wlan card is a WPC54G version 4
2007-11-26T01:40:00.000Z	killroy_2	Tidus	are you saying that I shouldn't need to ndiswrapper then with the WPC54G v4.0 PCMCIA?  And if not, how do I get it to be recognized in gutsy?  I've got the power light lit, so clearly it's powered up, but when I ifconfig I only see eth0 and eth1 (my wired and internal wireless) and no additiona devices...
2007-11-26T01:41:00.000Z	Tidus	killroy_2	yeah, you shouldn't need ndiswrapper.  it should be a Texas Instruments ACX111 chipset which is supported by default in gutsy
2007-11-26T01:42:00.000Z	killroy_2	Tidus	ok, then shouldn't I see the device in my network device list?
2007-11-26T01:43:00.000Z	Tidus	killroy_2	lspci it and see what chipset it's using
2007-11-26T01:43:00.000Z	killroy_2	Tidus	but assuming it is the TI chipset, is there anything I need to do to get the device initiated?
2007-11-26T02:18:00.000Z	killroy_2	Tidus	I have my lappy available now, so if you have a few minutes maybe you can direct me to a few answers.
2007-11-26T02:19:00.000Z	killroy_2	Tidus	firstly, lspci does review that the pcmcia nic (the wpc54g v4 is using the TI chipset
2007-11-26T02:20:00.000Z	killroy_2	Tidus	and the internal wifi nic is the Intel PRO Wireless 2100
2007-11-26T02:21:00.000Z	killroy_2	Tidus	here are two issues I have right now: the Intel wifi is no longer even scanning for connections.  I'd made a change to knetworkManager and set the wifi to DHCP and autostart and now it just doesn't scan at all
2007-11-26T02:21:00.000Z	killroy_2	Tidus	that being said, the linksys (wpc54g v4) doesn't even show up.
2007-11-26T02:22:00.000Z	killroy_2	Tidus	so, firstly do you have any idea how to get the linksys to start such that I can scan and connect, and secondly, what happened to my intel (if you have any suggestions, I would greatly appreciate it)
