2006-02-20T10:09:00.000Z	Psi-Jack		I just got a Kubuntu system installed, /barely/ due to a flakey CD-ROM drive. But some things aren't working. When I boot up, eth0 is not being brought up automatically, however, lo is, and ifup eth0 brings it up. How can I fix this so that it's started at boot-time?
2006-02-20T10:10:00.000Z	Psi-Jack		Mind you, this is a server install, /not/ a desktop install.
2006-02-20T10:10:00.000Z	wastrel	Psi-Jack	 put auto eth0  in your /etc/network/interfaces
2006-02-20T10:10:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	wastrel	Hmm. Why? Neither of my two other computers have that. Why does that ONE need it? :)
2006-02-20T10:11:00.000Z	wastrel	Psi-Jack	 your other 2 are magic?  i dunno. that's what works forme :] 
2006-02-20T10:12:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	wastrel	Well.... I'll /try/ it, but I don't like inconsistancies. heh
2006-02-20T10:15:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	wastrel	Well.... It worked..
2006-02-20T10:16:00.000Z	wastrel	Psi-Jack	 that's the standard way to start an interface on boot AFAIK... if there's another method i'd be interested to hear about it :] 
2006-02-20T10:16:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	wastrel	The way Kubuntu /appears/ to do it, is through using hotplug, but it's not working on that particular system for some reason.
2006-02-20T10:17:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	wastrel	But then again, Kubuntu and Ubuntu use the exact same installer, so they're pretty much identical in most regards.
2006-02-20T10:17:00.000Z	wastrel	Psi-Jack	 yeah i'm not too familiar with kde...
2006-02-20T10:17:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	wastrel	That system doesn't even have KDE. :)
2006-02-20T10:18:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	wastrel	Nor X. It's a bare minimum server install.
2006-02-21T07:54:00.000Z	wastrel	Psi-Jack	 i have reiser modules on my system... so i assume it's in the default kernel
2006-02-21T07:54:00.000Z	wastrel	Psi-Jack	 ah reiser4 - not sure
2006-02-21T07:55:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	wastrel	Wow. Heh. I'm about to copy my Kubuntu installation from my testing HDD to my primary, instead of re-installing,, and noticed mkfs.reiser4.
2006-02-21T09:15:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	wastrel	bitchx-gtk. :)
2006-02-21T09:16:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	wastrel	Scarey!
