2005-05-08T06:44:00.000Z	qweqw		i wouldn't do that, Delgul
2005-05-08T06:45:00.000Z	qweqw		you'd probably get away with it, becase amd emulates 32 bits nicely
2005-05-08T06:46:00.000Z	Delgul	qweqw	Hmm... so if I want to run a 64 bit kernel on my 64 bit processor, this is only useful/safe if I also use 64 bit libs and apps? Just the kernel is not possible?
2005-05-08T06:47:00.000Z	qweqw		not exactly, Delgul
2005-05-08T06:47:00.000Z	qweqw		you COULD concievably do that, but it would take a whole lot of searching for the answer
2005-05-08T06:47:00.000Z	qweqw		solution
2005-05-08T06:48:00.000Z	qweqw		anyway, the only benefit of having a 64 bit system is that they can sometimes be faster. oh, and more ram.. so much that you'll never need it unless you want to store all your files in ram
2005-05-08T06:49:00.000Z	Delgul	qweqw	Too bad I cant use my hw fully, I tried the amd64 hoary, but it was a bit shaky... Well I just will have to wait until Ubuntu amd64 has matured a little I guess
2005-05-08T06:49:00.000Z	qweqw		the benefit of a 32 bit system is: more programs available, smaller size of binaries(faster loading), better gaming performance
2005-05-08T06:50:00.000Z	qweqw	Delgul	they do a pretty good job on the amd64
2005-05-08T06:50:00.000Z	qweqw		sure, Cain
2005-05-08T06:50:00.000Z	qweqw		install it as a server, though
2005-05-08T06:51:00.000Z	qweqw		gnome desktop will be horrible on that
2005-05-08T06:51:00.000Z	qweqw		start out with bare bones, apt-get the packages you want
2005-05-08T06:51:00.000Z	qweqw		yep, get fluxbox or ion3 instead
2005-05-08T06:52:00.000Z	Delgul	qweqw	I am not complaining. I solved a lot of the problems by using a 32 bit chroot. But especially the alsa sound problems were bad. But then again, I had a problem with dpkg crashing during the first time install, so it might be that my base system was not fully working....
2005-05-08T06:52:00.000Z	qweqw		xfce4 is a log bigger than fluxbox
2005-05-08T06:59:00.000Z	Delgul	qweqw	So what do I use best for my amd64 processor? A K7 kernel?
