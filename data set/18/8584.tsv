2008-10-25T13:20:00.000Z	cloud-e		Hello... I just installed 8.04.1 and am getting static from my sound card. It is an Creative Sound Blaster Live! Wave card. This is an oldie but goodie. I know it works with OpenSuse 11 coz I tried it on my virtual machine. Please help! :(

2008-10-25T13:23:00.000Z	nikolam	cloud-e	maybe you need to get sound up a little> try alsamixergui
2008-10-25T13:27:00.000Z	nikolam	cloud-e	Then you should check ubuntuforums for a help or try to see what modules are loaded with lsmod etc
2008-10-25T13:28:00.000Z	nikolam	cloud-e	He is saying where you are listening the sound, on the card itself..
2008-10-25T13:30:00.000Z	nikolam	cloud-e	Then try to search ubuntuforums or google.. http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=114551

2008-10-25T14:26:00.000Z	nikolam	cloud-e	You can use ntfs-3g for that and list partition in /etc/fstab
2008-10-25T14:28:00.000Z	nikolam	cloud-e	you should also install ntfsprogs
2008-10-25T14:29:00.000Z	nikolam	cloud-e	that is too old
2008-10-25T14:29:00.000Z	nikolam	cloud-e	all you need to do is install ntfs-3g, ntfs-config and ntfsprogs
2008-10-25T14:29:00.000Z	nikolam	cloud-e	and add partition in /etc/fstab
