2010-12-22T18:57:00.000Z	sandhya		Hi, all my network interfaces are down. I ran sudo lshw -C network and it shows that both my ethernet as well as my wifi adapter is DISABLED.
2010-12-22T18:58:00.000Z	sandhya		my laptops hardware setting for wifi is enabled, fyi
2010-12-22T18:59:00.000Z	sam-_-	sandhya	what does ifconfig -a say?
2010-12-22T19:00:00.000Z	sandhya	sam-_-	I only see "lo"
2010-12-22T19:00:00.000Z	sam-_-	sandhya	can you post the lshw thing. i'm having difficulties to imagine
2010-12-22T19:03:00.000Z	sandhya	sam-_-	This is on another laptop... A standard lshw entry looks like "* - network" and the entry on the faulty laptop states "* - network DISABLED"
2010-12-22T19:04:00.000Z	sam-_-	sandhya	tell us the exact name
2010-12-22T19:04:00.000Z	sandhya	sam-_-	exact name of what? It isn't one card. it's both and they were working fine.
2010-12-22T19:04:00.000Z	sam-_-	sandhya	you didn't accidentally disable them in the bios
2010-12-22T19:05:00.000Z	sam-_-	sandhya	you didn't accidentally disable them in the bios?
2010-12-22T19:05:00.000Z	sandhya	sam-_-	nope - this is actually my dad's laptop and he doesn't know anything besides the power button and firefox.
2010-12-22T19:05:00.000Z	sandhya	sam-_-	if they were disabled in the bios, would they still register in lshw?
2010-12-22T19:06:00.000Z	sam-_-	sandhya	good question. i don't know
2010-12-22T19:09:00.000Z	sam-_-	sandhya	lsmod |grep -i r8169    to tell if the driver loaded, is it?
2010-12-22T19:10:00.000Z	sandhya	sam-_-	I have two entries when I try that
2010-12-22T19:16:00.000Z	sam-_-	sandhya	so how did you solve it?
2010-12-22T19:17:00.000Z	sandhya	sam-_-	I haven't solved it as such, I suppose. I've just enabled eth0 as per histo's command to add it manually.
2010-12-22T19:19:00.000Z	sam-_-	sandhya	what command?
