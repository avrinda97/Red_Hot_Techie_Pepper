2007-07-03T13:09:00.000Z	vontux		anyone in here have troubles with usb wifi on ubuntu 7.04?
2007-07-03T13:09:00.000Z	filthpig	vontux	yeah, having it right now :s
2007-07-03T13:10:00.000Z	vontux	filthpig	yeah? what is the name of your device?
2007-07-03T13:10:00.000Z	filthpig	vontux	Linksys WUSB54GC...
2007-07-03T13:11:00.000Z	vontux	filthpig	are you able to detect the device, but run into trouble connecting to your access point?
2007-07-03T13:12:00.000Z	filthpig	vontux	yeah, pretty much. The USB adapter is alive and kicking, I find the network.. But with WEP enabled I cannot connect, without WEP I connect but do not get an internet connection
2007-07-03T13:13:00.000Z	vontux	filthpig	weird, I get a very similar problem, I can detect the network ;however, it says my signal strength is zero once I try to actually connect
2007-07-03T13:14:00.000Z	vontux	filthpig	and I'm only like 5 feet from the ap
2007-07-03T13:14:00.000Z	filthpig	vontux	ditto. Hey, are you sitting right behind me or what? ;p
2007-07-03T13:15:00.000Z	vontux	filthpig	hehe yeah, I'm ominpresent actually.....
2007-07-03T13:15:00.000Z	vontux	filthpig	although, I am having my troubles with a belkin usb device, so go figur4e
2007-07-03T13:16:00.000Z	vontux	filthpig	I'm willing to bet that it is some kinda driver conflict
2007-07-03T13:17:00.000Z	filthpig	vontux	yeah, or some tiny little detail somewhere
2007-07-03T13:18:00.000Z	vontux	filthpig	have you tried googling with any success for how to's with your particular device?
2007-07-03T13:19:00.000Z	filthpig	vontux	I'm too tired to try, to be honest..
2007-07-03T13:20:00.000Z	vontux	filthpig	yeah, same here :)
2007-07-03T13:21:00.000Z	vontux	filthpig	do you have access to the windows drivers for your device? if so you might try getting it to work w/ ndiswrapper
2007-07-03T13:22:00.000Z	filthpig	vontux	Linksys have linuxdrivers, so it's not a prob
