2008-01-02T05:30:00.000Z	godzirra		Ok, I have a problem on my wireless on myl aptop in gutsy where after a while, the network just shuts down.  I can't get it back up, and a lot of abilities of the laptop don't work (such as opening a terminal window).  I checked lsmod, and the only difference I can see is that when I do an lsmod, ipw3945 (my card) is set to "0" so it isn't being used....
2008-01-02T05:31:00.000Z	tcpdumpgod	godzirra	is it a broadcom chipset?
2008-01-02T05:31:00.000Z	godzirra	tcpdumpgod	yes.
2008-01-02T05:31:00.000Z	godzirra	tcpdumpgod	It works fine though for a while... and that while can be anywhere from an hour to 10 hours.
2008-01-02T05:32:00.000Z	tcpdumpgod	godzirra	are you using ndiswrapper?
2008-01-02T05:32:00.000Z	godzirra	tcpdumpgod	I dunno... what was teh default setup?  Gutsy recognized it, so I didnt screw with it after install.
2008-01-02T05:33:00.000Z	tcpdumpgod	godzirra	do a "lsmod |grep ndis"
2008-01-02T05:33:00.000Z	godzirra	tcpdumpgod	apparently I am not.
2008-01-02T05:33:00.000Z	tcpdumpgod	godzirra	did you use the "Restricted drivers manager" to get your card working?
2008-01-02T05:40:00.000Z	godzirra	tcpdumpgod	so any suggestions?
2008-01-02T05:40:00.000Z	tcpdumpgod	godzirra	not off the top of my head.
2008-01-02T05:41:00.000Z	tcpdumpgod	godzirra	did you say you used restricted drivers manager to get your wireless card working?
2008-01-02T05:41:00.000Z	godzirra	tcpdumpgod	I did.
2008-01-02T05:41:00.000Z	godzirra	tcpdumpgod	me?  or someone else?
2008-01-02T05:41:00.000Z	tcpdumpgod	godzirra	"lsmod |grep ndis"
2008-01-02T05:42:00.000Z	godzirra	tcpdumpgod	already did that, but no ndiswrapper.
2008-01-02T05:42:00.000Z	tcpdumpgod	godzirra	"modprobe ndiswrapper"
2008-01-02T05:42:00.000Z	godzirra	tcpdumpgod	now I've got this when I do an lsmod:  ndiswrapper           185240  0
