2007-04-27T09:15:00.000Z	Madpilot	Comrade-Sergei	there is likely something wrong with your repository setup - pastebin your sources.list for us, please
2007-04-27T09:16:00.000Z	Comrade-Sergei	Madpilot	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/17915/
2007-04-27T09:17:00.000Z	Madpilot	Comrade-Sergei	that looks OK. what're you trying to install that throws the error up?
2007-04-27T09:17:00.000Z	Comrade-Sergei	Madpilot	want a screenshot for accuracy?
2007-04-27T09:17:00.000Z	Madpilot	Comrade-Sergei	sure. pastebin that, too
2007-04-27T09:18:00.000Z	Madpilot	Comrade-Sergei	actually, you've still got one Breezy repo in there - last line of the paste
2007-04-27T09:18:00.000Z	Comrade-Sergei	Madpilot	take it out?
2007-04-27T09:18:00.000Z	Madpilot	Comrade-Sergei	yes. You can't mix & match repos between versions
2007-04-27T09:19:00.000Z	Madpilot	Comrade-Sergei	use http://www.ubuntu-nl.org/source-o-matic to rebuild your sources.list to a coherent one

2007-04-27T09:20:00.000Z	Madpilot	Comrade-Sergei	good riddance. why use scripts for stuff that's easier to do yourself?
2007-04-27T09:21:00.000Z	Comrade-Sergei	Madpilot	i like easy ubuntu its not nearly as bad as it used to be and its like 50x better than automatix
