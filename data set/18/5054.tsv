2008-12-22T13:22:00.000Z	clou		do you think ubuntu will run faster installed in virtualbox on windows xp host
2008-12-22T13:22:00.000Z	clou		or as a live cd ?
2008-12-22T13:22:00.000Z	ikonia	clou	lunakrist depends on what your doing,
2008-12-22T13:22:00.000Z	ikonia	clou	try them both, see what fits for you
2008-12-22T13:22:00.000Z	ikonia	clou	then a livecd is a better experience
2008-12-22T13:24:00.000Z	clou	ikonia	the livecd should run faster?
2008-12-22T13:25:00.000Z	ikonia	clou	no the livecd should be a better experience to use/try ubuntu
2008-12-22T13:25:00.000Z	clou	ikonia	for the moment i need the fastest possibility
2008-12-22T13:25:00.000Z	ikonia	clou	then try both
2008-12-29T16:06:00.000Z	ikonia	clou	you should use the desktop version for ubuntu and remove the packages you don't want
2008-12-29T16:07:00.000Z	clou	ikonia	isn't there an iso without a desktop environment?
2008-12-29T16:07:00.000Z	ikonia	clou	yes, but you don't want it as it has nothing to do wtih X
2008-12-29T16:07:00.000Z	ikonia	clou	you want the desktop environment and just remove teh ubuntu theme as thats all it is
2008-12-29T16:11:00.000Z	ikonia	clou	no
2008-12-29T16:11:00.000Z	ikonia	clou	it's a theme nothing more
2008-12-29T16:12:00.000Z	ikonia	clou	I'll say it again - remove the packages you don't want/themese you don't want
2008-12-29T16:13:00.000Z	ikonia	clou	no, it's not. for the 4th time. IT's a theme
