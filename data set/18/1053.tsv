2012-01-01T06:51:00.000Z	L1nuxRules		PC user and Linux user we are 100% in control of OUR OS
2012-01-01T06:52:00.000Z	aBound	L1nuxRules	With all the Linux control we can still break are systems. :-)
2012-01-01T06:53:00.000Z	L1nuxRules	aBound	thats all that breaks Linux though the user :)
2012-01-01T06:53:00.000Z	aBound	L1nuxRules	I broke grub and did a reinstall. :-)
2012-01-01T06:54:00.000Z	L1nuxRules	aBound	you should have fixed grub though
2012-01-01T06:55:00.000Z	aBound	L1nuxRules	When you're a newcomer and barely any experience with Linux fixing grub is a downfall. :P
2012-01-01T06:56:00.000Z	L1nuxRules	aBound	I know where your coming from but I do work in 2nd line support and before that I mwas always good/or quick to fix stuff
2012-01-01T06:56:00.000Z	aBound	L1nuxRules	I probably wouldn't have any issues if I had the right books.
2012-01-01T06:57:00.000Z	aBound	L1nuxRules	Learning shell scripting by a tutorial just doesn't work for me.
2012-01-01T06:57:00.000Z	L1nuxRules	aBound	what you struggling with ?
2012-01-01T06:58:00.000Z	aBound	L1nuxRules	Nothing as of right now just gotta get rid of this orange box. But figures learning shell scripting through tutorials that are so poor are a pain.
2012-01-01T06:59:00.000Z	L1nuxRules	aBound	I learned shell scripting by playing with it . Yes read but inbetween reading play around with it!
2012-01-01T07:00:00.000Z	aBound	L1nuxRules	I agree to an extent reading is boring but try learning Physics without a textbook or some kind of a math book it'll be tough.
2012-01-01T07:05:00.000Z	L1nuxRules	aBound	yeah ity is, what you need help with again?
2012-01-01T07:05:00.000Z	aBound	L1nuxRules	I got rid of the orange box by logging off.
2012-01-01T07:06:00.000Z	aBound	L1nuxRules	Hacker elite. lol
2012-01-01T07:34:00.000Z	aBound	L1nuxRules	I might reinstall Ubuntu for new years.
2012-01-01T07:35:00.000Z	L1nuxRules	aBound	Linux doesent work like windows
