2011-09-03T00:16:00.000Z	improveupon		firefox keeps crashing my os. you have to use magic sysrq to reboot. i have already tried removing and re-installing the package + dependencies.
2011-09-03T00:17:00.000Z	improveupon		(almost any suggestions will be appreciated)
2011-09-03T00:17:00.000Z	improveupon		like 2 gigs
2011-09-03T00:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	improveupon	is it ok as a different user?
2011-09-03T19:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	improveupon	if you create a fresh firefox profile, is it ok?
2011-09-03T19:41:00.000Z	improveupon	ActionParsnip	no
2011-09-03T19:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	improveupon	try updating java, there is a 23 version available
2011-09-03T19:43:00.000Z	improveupon	ActionParsnip	thank you
2011-09-03T19:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	improveupon	try a different browser too to test
2011-09-03T19:45:00.000Z	improveupon	ActionParsnip	if the new browser does not work, what would you think were the problem?
2011-09-03T19:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	improveupon	then it's java from what the error says, check the web for forums mentioning the same error
2011-09-03T19:47:00.000Z	improveupon	ActionParsnip	thanks again
2011-09-03T21:36:00.000Z	improveupon	ActionParsnip	it appears that if i use another browser, the system does not crash
2011-09-03T21:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	improveupon	sounds about right :)
2011-09-03T21:37:00.000Z	improveupon	ActionParsnip	so it is just that firefox was hogging memory? but it was not doing that before. for a long time i used it for days at a time and it was ok.
2011-09-03T21:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	improveupon	again, sounds about right
2011-09-03T21:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	improveupon	I don't use firefox these days, maybe others can advise. I think it's an appauling browser
2011-09-03T21:44:00.000Z	improveupon	ActionParsnip	well, thanks again
