2007-05-10T14:26:00.000Z	hendrixski	RAH66	Beryl can be kind of overwhelming.  but when you get it configured the way you like it is really nice
2007-05-10T14:26:00.000Z	hendrixski	RAH66	there are a lot of great videos about Beryl on youTube.  do a search, and your eyes will pop
2007-05-10T14:27:00.000Z	hendrixski	RAH66	If you're looking for a solid business platform.. then yeah, Beryl would be too much of a risk, less risk than vista though
2007-05-10T14:28:00.000Z	hendrixski	RAH66	you can run Ubuntu on XP inside of a virtual machine
2007-05-10T14:29:00.000Z	hendrixski	RAH66	www.vmware.com  and download vmware server, then load Ubuntu in it.  Very safe and easy
2007-05-10T14:37:00.000Z	hendrixski	RAH66	depends.  How fast is your connection?
2007-05-10T14:40:00.000Z	hendrixski	RAH66	CDT... that's for someone else... it's the C++ Development Toolkit for eclipse... unless you're interested in that
2007-05-10T14:44:00.000Z	hendrixski	RAH66	when you install Ubuntu, or even before, a good place to ask questions is www.ubuntuforums.org
