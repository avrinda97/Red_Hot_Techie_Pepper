2008-07-18T06:40:00.000Z	noriyuki		How can I change my password using the terminal?
2008-07-18T06:40:00.000Z	noriyuki		THANKS!
2008-07-18T06:42:00.000Z	noriyuki		how can i change to a password that is "too simple"
2008-07-18T06:43:00.000Z	Flannel	noriyuki	Why do you want to do that?
2008-07-18T06:44:00.000Z	noriyuki	Flannel	The one I have now is very large
2008-07-18T06:44:00.000Z	Flannel	noriyuki	I don't understand what you're asking
2008-07-18T06:46:00.000Z	noriyuki	Flannel	I want to change my password "passwd" is there a way to make the ccomputer to change it to anything no matter how simple it is
2008-07-18T06:46:00.000Z	noriyuki	Flannel	I want to change my password "passwd" is there a way to make the ccomputer to change it to anything no matter how simple it is
2008-07-18T06:46:00.000Z	Flannel	noriyuki	What are you trying to accomplish?  Auto log in?  Or you just really enjoy security issues?
2008-07-18T06:47:00.000Z	noriyuki	Flannel	the password I have is too large. So I want to change it to a simpler one....
2008-07-18T06:47:00.000Z	Flannel	noriyuki	Yes, passwd will do that.
2008-07-18T06:48:00.000Z	noriyuki	Flannel	but it says that the pass is too simple. Is there a way to makeubuntu to change it no matter how simple
2008-07-18T06:49:00.000Z	Flannel	noriyuki	Again, if its complaining about simplicity, the password is probably not a good idea. What are you trying to accomplish with such a diminuitive password?
2008-07-18T06:51:00.000Z	noriyuki	Flannel	I had that password before formating alright? And I put another one when I formatted. I want the other one... I just want a answer my friend can you help me?
2008-07-18T06:52:00.000Z	noriyuki	Flannel	Are you there?
2008-07-18T06:52:00.000Z	Flannel	noriyuki	Its probably a bad idea to have that password, but use this to get around it: sudo passwd [username] (where [username] is your user)
2008-07-18T06:53:00.000Z	noriyuki	Flannel	I tried that one and it doesnt change. I mean... It seems to be working but when I attempt to use it, the old one remains as the password
2008-12-29T04:13:00.000Z	Flannel	noriyuki	Try Mixxx
