2009-06-05T21:19:00.000Z	Goldiadkin		Hi, I can't find the .gnome folder in my Home, I wanted to install a couple of scripts but there is no gnome folder there. Shouldn't it be there from when I installed gimp?
2009-06-05T21:19:00.000Z	fccf	Goldiadkin	go to view in nautilus and click Show Hidden Files
2009-06-05T21:20:00.000Z	Goldiadkin	fccf	done that, there's nowhere to be found
2009-06-05T21:20:00.000Z	fccf	Goldiadkin	really, are you running gnome?
2009-06-05T21:20:00.000Z	Goldiadkin	fccf	yeap, gnome it is.
2009-06-05T21:28:00.000Z	Goldiadkin	fccf	should I reinstall gimp?
2009-06-05T21:30:00.000Z	fccf	Goldiadkin	I am confused because if you don't have .gnome then a whole lot of other stuff my become a problem later ... you might try running sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop ... while it may already be installed .. there could be some packaging triggers in there that need to be processed
2009-06-05T21:33:00.000Z	Goldiadkin	fccf	done, but it says i've already got newest version and doesn't change anything
2009-06-05T21:34:00.000Z	fccf	Goldiadkin	type ls -d from ~/ and see if you see .gnome
2009-06-05T21:43:00.000Z	Goldiadkin	fccf	I can't see gnome typing ls -d on my home, furthermore, i only get a dot as an answer as in ls -d >>.>>end of line
2009-06-05T21:44:00.000Z	fccf	Goldiadkin	that means you have a .gnome directory... and everything "should" work
2009-06-05T21:46:00.000Z	Goldiadkin	fccf	where can i find it? any idea?
2009-06-05T21:47:00.000Z	fccf	Goldiadkin	what do you need to look in .gnome for?
2009-06-05T21:47:00.000Z	Goldiadkin	fccf	i need to install a couple of scripts
2009-06-05T21:47:00.000Z	fccf	Goldiadkin	from home type cd .gnome and see if that works
2009-06-05T21:50:00.000Z	Goldiadkin	fccf	yes it does, how do i get from here to gimp? hey, by the way, thanks for everything
2009-06-05T21:50:00.000Z	fccf	Goldiadkin	no problem: do you mean to gimp from here?
2009-06-05T21:50:00.000Z	fccf	Goldiadkin	or from gimp to here
