2005-08-29T11:34:00.000Z	theblue		OUCH.
2005-08-29T11:34:00.000Z	theblue		$99?
2005-08-29T11:34:00.000Z	theblue		I can get 20 Ubuntu CDs FOR FREE.
2005-08-29T11:34:00.000Z	theblue		And all the software I want FOR FREE.
2005-08-29T11:35:00.000Z	theblue		Let's see, M$ rapes me and takes control of my PC, my rights, and my firstborn, and I'm PAYING THEM.
2005-08-29T11:35:00.000Z	theblue		For $99.
2005-08-29T11:35:00.000Z	theblue		Amen.
2005-08-29T11:35:00.000Z	theblue		DAMN.
2005-08-29T11:36:00.000Z	theblue		And $35 whenever you need help that's never helpful.
2005-08-29T11:36:00.000Z	theblue		Here, I can just drop in, 24/7 and ask a question, and someone who knows about it is almost always here to help.
2005-08-29T11:36:00.000Z	dooglus	theblue	I've had no major problems with breezy in the last few months.
2005-08-29T11:37:00.000Z	theblue	dooglus	I'm just wondering if Shipit CDs ordered now are Breezys.
2005-08-29T11:37:00.000Z	dooglus	theblue	I doubt it.  breezy isn't released yet.
2005-08-29T11:37:00.000Z	theblue	dooglus	Nevermind.
2005-10-16T16:52:00.000Z	dooglus	theblue	where did you last see them?
2005-10-16T16:52:00.000Z	theblue	dooglus	Seriously
2005-10-16T16:52:00.000Z	dooglus	theblue	what do you want to know?
2005-12-25T07:30:00.000Z	dooglus	theblue	probably because a lot more people can read CDs than DVDs
