2011-09-23T20:14:00.000Z	josePHPagoda		i'm running 10.04 and i'm wanting to set up clamav... the version in the main repo is too old, and the ppa doesn't seem to have a new clamav
2011-09-23T20:15:00.000Z	WinCamXP	josePHPagoda	find the website for that program
2011-09-23T20:15:00.000Z	josePHPagoda		it points me to the ppa
2011-09-23T20:15:00.000Z	WinCamXP		might be like super tux kart, the ubuntu repos dont actually have the newest version
2011-09-23T20:15:00.000Z	josePHPagoda		which doesn't contain what is needed, I also checked the official ubuntu docs and those don't help
2011-09-23T20:15:00.000Z	josePHPagoda		yeah... i use getdeb and playdeb for that stuff
2011-09-23T20:18:00.000Z	josePHPagoda		clamav is supposeadly in the backports, but it seems like the ubuntu team has been a bit slow on keeping it up to date
2011-09-23T20:19:00.000Z	WinCamXP		what exactly is clamav?
2011-09-23T20:19:00.000Z	WinCamXP		"av" sounds like "antivirus"
2011-09-23T20:19:00.000Z	WinCamXP		oh ok
2011-09-23T20:19:00.000Z	josePHPagoda		it's an antivirus
2011-09-23T20:19:00.000Z	WinCamXP		does it look for linux viruss or windows viruses?
2011-09-23T20:19:00.000Z	josePHPagoda		both
2011-09-23T20:19:00.000Z	josePHPagoda		we're using it for windows viruses and such
2011-09-23T20:19:00.000Z	WinCamXP		running a fileserver?
2011-09-23T20:20:00.000Z	WinCamXP		im not sure if the amd site has linux drivers
2011-09-23T20:20:00.000Z	WinCamXP		go ahead and check
2011-09-23T20:21:00.000Z	josePHPagoda	WinCamXP	it's kind of a fileserver
