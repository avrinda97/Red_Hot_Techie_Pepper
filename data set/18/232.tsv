2012-09-28T21:31:00.000Z	cakehero		so
2012-09-28T21:31:00.000Z	cakehero		let me ask a better question
2012-09-28T21:31:00.000Z	iceroot	cakehero	also see packages.ubuntu.com for changelogs
2012-09-28T21:31:00.000Z	cakehero		someone at my company says "since we don't maintain ubuntu we have to make sure we are staying up with critical updates". I don't think think there are many kernel updates (10.04/lucid)
2012-09-28T21:31:00.000Z	iceroot	cakehero	there are
2012-09-28T21:32:00.000Z	iceroot	cakehero	but only security fixes
2012-09-28T21:32:00.000Z	cakehero	iceroot	any great way to keep up with them?
2012-09-28T21:32:00.000Z	iceroot	cakehero	we have security mailinglists if you are interested in such informations. to get the latest updates for the kernel just use the update-manager
2012-09-28T21:35:00.000Z	iceroot	cakehero	http://changelogs.ubuntu.com/changelogs/pool/main/l/linux/linux_2.6.32-43.97/changelog
