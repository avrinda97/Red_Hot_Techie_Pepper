2008-09-14T20:48:00.000Z	s0u][ight		my dependencies are broken :|
2008-09-14T20:48:00.000Z	s0u][ight		!repos
2008-09-14T20:49:00.000Z	s0u][ight		it's just hanging at apt-get update
2008-09-14T20:50:00.000Z	s0u][ight		no i can't even install it
2008-09-14T20:50:00.000Z	s0u][ight		i had installed libc6 from intrepid's repos
2008-09-14T20:50:00.000Z	s0u][ight		that conflicted so i did
2008-09-14T20:50:00.000Z	s0u][ight		apt-get -f install
2008-09-14T20:50:00.000Z	s0u][ight		now my repos are broken
2008-09-14T20:52:00.000Z	s0u][ight		but now i'm stuck :|
2008-09-14T20:52:00.000Z	somedrew_	s0u][ight	oh noes...libc6 is very integral to the system. Never upgrade using a different repo than your official system sources. Is it just your repo that's broken or most C apps? You will probably have to chroot into your system using a live cd and downgrade libc6 to othe appropriate version, instructions can be found in the wiki.
2008-09-14T20:53:00.000Z	somedrew_	s0u][ight	*shoud read "never upgrade libc6 from non official...etc*, I'll check on a source for the chroot surgery.
2008-09-14T20:53:00.000Z	s0u][ight	somedrew_	is that the reason apt-get update hangs?
2008-09-14T20:54:00.000Z	somedrew_	s0u][ight	could be. I'd guess that MOST apps are currently busted on the system
2008-09-14T20:58:00.000Z	somedrew_	s0u][ight	it will be an easy fix though https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LiveCdRecovery follow 'update recovery' section. You'll need a live cd though and make sure your sources.list is the appropriate one for your ubuntu version. cheers
2008-09-14T20:59:00.000Z	s0u][ight	somedrew_	tnx
2008-09-14T20:59:00.000Z	somedrew_	s0u][ight	with those instructions you'll basically be using apt-get on the live cd to downgrade libc6 to the proper version in your system
2008-09-14T21:01:00.000Z	s0u][ight	somedrew_	the steps are easy :)
2008-09-14T21:02:00.000Z	somedrew_	s0u][ight	the steps should work, if libc6 doesn't get installed just install it manually. About wireless...hopefully the drivers will be on the cd
