2008-10-23T23:22:00.000Z	SiDi_2		What is the command to completely repair a broken X server ?
2008-10-23T23:23:00.000Z	SiDi_2		Can people stop playing with the bot please? :|
2008-10-23T23:24:00.000Z	SiDi_2		Does anyone know what is the command line that does the same  thing as "fix xorg" in recovery mode, please ?
2008-10-23T23:26:00.000Z	SiDi_2		Thanks :)
2008-10-23T23:26:00.000Z	lswest	SiDi_2	you can use w3 or elinks to browse from CLI
2008-10-23T23:27:00.000Z	lswest	SiDi_2	what are you trying to do?
2008-10-23T23:32:00.000Z	lswest	SiDi_2	what's your graphics card?  What driver do you use?
2008-10-23T23:32:00.000Z	lswest	SiDi_2	the dpkg-reconfigure will have set up some other driver for you to use, probably, therefore the login may not show up if the driver is unsupported
2008-10-23T23:33:00.000Z	lswest	SiDi_2	try rebooting, then if that doesn't work, try re-installing your graphics driver
2008-10-23T23:34:00.000Z	SiDi_2	lswest	it has 0% things to do with my GPU.
2008-10-23T23:34:00.000Z	lswest	SiDi_2	if you run startx from normal user, does it give you and errors?
2008-10-23T23:34:00.000Z	SiDi_2	lswest	no errors on tty1 or 8, just that it wont load anything apart from mouse cursor
2008-10-23T23:35:00.000Z	lswest	SiDi_2	My gut feeling is that the monitor or gfx card isn't configured properly, but I don't know
2008-10-23T23:36:00.000Z	SiDi_2	lswest	it wouldnt work with startx from root then
2008-10-23T23:37:00.000Z	lswest	SiDi_2	gonna let someone else jump in, I'm not sure.  Check the permissions of your xorg.conf file though
2008-10-23T23:37:00.000Z	SiDi_2	lswest	what should it be?
2008-10-23T23:38:00.000Z	lswest	SiDi_2	yup
