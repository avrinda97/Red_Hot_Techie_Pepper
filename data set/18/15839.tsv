2011-12-09T21:38:00.000Z	dr_willis	Amon-Ra	 what does it do exatly? you see a grub menu?
2011-12-09T21:40:00.000Z	Amon-Ra	dr_willis	yes
2011-12-09T21:41:00.000Z	dr_willis	Amon-Ra	 you can get by with just a / and swap.
2011-12-09T21:41:00.000Z	dr_willis	Amon-Ra	 seems odd you are not even getting to the grub menu.
2011-12-09T21:41:00.000Z	Amon-Ra	dr_willis	what is grub menu ? :)
2011-12-09T21:42:00.000Z	dr_willis	Amon-Ra	 the very first menus/loading images.
2011-12-09T21:43:00.000Z	dr_willis	Amon-Ra	 it would be hidden by default unless you hit the shift key. but you are not even seeing the splash screens. so somthing else seems wrong
2011-12-09T21:53:00.000Z	dr_willis	Amon-Ra	 double check your bios and makre sure its set to boot from the hd?
2011-12-09T21:53:00.000Z	Amon-Ra	dr_willis	yes that's 100% sure correct
