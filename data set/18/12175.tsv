2006-07-30T08:28:00.000Z	Tonren		Hey guys, I can't get Azureus OR BitTornado working.  What the heck is going on?  Has anyone had trouble torrenting?  Does anyone know of a good app?
2006-07-30T08:30:00.000Z	Kr4t05	Tonren	uTorrent via Wine
2006-07-30T08:32:00.000Z	Tonren	Kr4t05	What if I don't want to bloody use Wine for a bloody torrent program?!
2006-07-30T08:33:00.000Z	Kr4t05	Tonren	chill, it was a suggestion.
2006-07-30T08:34:00.000Z	Kr4t05	Tonren	then your life just sucks, do us all a favor and end it.
2006-07-30T08:34:00.000Z	Tonren	Kr4t05	Sorry for yelling at you.  I am frustrated.
2006-07-30T08:34:00.000Z	Kr4t05	Tonren	Yeah...
2006-07-30T08:34:00.000Z	Kr4t05	Tonren	Join the club?
2006-07-30T08:34:00.000Z	Tonren	Kr4t05	Sure thing, tough guy
2006-07-30T08:36:00.000Z	Kr4t05	Tonren	I apologize, I was out of line.
2006-07-30T08:36:00.000Z	Tonren	Kr4t05	Apology accepted, dude.  I shouldn't have shouted.  You were just trying to help.
2006-07-30T08:38:00.000Z	Kr4t05	Tonren	Do you happen to be familiar with OiNK.me.com?
2006-07-30T08:38:00.000Z	Tonren	Kr4t05	Never heard of it.  What's its story?
2006-07-30T08:39:00.000Z	Kr4t05	Tonren	Nothing in particular. Torrent tracker, and I can't get it to work.
2006-07-30T08:41:00.000Z	Tonren	Kr4t05	Are you behind a router?  That always screws up BT
2006-07-30T08:41:00.000Z	Kr4t05	Tonren	other trackers work fine.
2006-07-30T08:41:00.000Z	Kr4t05	Tonren	I think OiNK just doesn't like me.
2006-07-30T08:49:00.000Z	Kr4t05	Tonren	having better luck than me. :P
