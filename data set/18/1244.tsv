2011-04-22T18:07:00.000Z	edbian	kes0r	Well the proper place to put it is in /home/bin  or /usr/local/bin
2011-04-22T18:07:00.000Z	edbian	kes0r	But if you want it technically hidden you simply put a period in the front of it.
2011-04-22T18:07:00.000Z	edbian	kes0r	.scriptName.sh
2011-04-22T18:08:00.000Z	edbian	kes0r	If you put it in /home/kes0r/bin  you can run it from the command line (regardless of where the terminal is)
2011-04-22T18:08:00.000Z	kes0r	edbian	ok nvm i think its ok its in home directory anway
2011-04-22T18:08:00.000Z	kes0r		xD

2011-04-22T18:09:00.000Z	edbian	kes0r	A period in front of the filename makes it hidden
2011-04-22T18:10:00.000Z	kes0r	edbian	ok thanks
2011-04-22T18:10:00.000Z	edbian	kes0r	If you run 'skype' in the terminal skype will be run normally and this script will be ignored
2011-04-22T18:10:00.000Z	edbian	kes0r	Gotta go!  Have a good day!@
