2010-12-20T09:00:00.000Z	Rix_		hello
2010-12-20T09:02:00.000Z	snake	Rix_	what wireless network card do you have.
2010-12-20T09:02:00.000Z	Rix_	snake	hold  on
2010-12-20T09:03:00.000Z	snake	Rix_	you may be able to find drivers for it in jockey-gtk, or System->Administration->Additional Drivers
2010-12-20T09:03:00.000Z	Rix_	snake	intel wireless wifi link 4965agn
2010-12-20T09:04:00.000Z	snake	Rix_	okay, try the additional drivers thing if you haven't already.
2010-12-20T09:04:00.000Z	snake	Rix_	but the problem is on ubuntu correct?
2010-12-20T09:05:00.000Z	snake	Rix_	and you still have the disk that you used to install right?
2010-12-20T09:05:00.000Z	snake	Rix_	pop it in, and you should be able to go to their and install the driver for it.
2010-12-20T09:06:00.000Z	snake	Rix_	the disk you used to install, but before you reboot. we should see if it has support ;) hang on
2010-12-20T09:09:00.000Z	snake	Rix_	no, were not reinstalling...
2010-12-20T09:11:00.000Z	snake	Rix_	Ahh I see, you are simply using ubuntu in a live environement.
2010-12-20T09:12:00.000Z	snake	Rix_	well you should look into dualbooting so the changes would be permanent.
2010-12-20T09:12:00.000Z	snake	Rix_	or even having two computers
2010-12-20T09:13:00.000Z	snake	Rix_	or if you have a faster computer you could use virtualization like virtualbox, or vmware workstation to run ubunt inside windows.
2010-12-20T09:17:00.000Z	snake	Rix_	would you be needing any further assistance?
2010-12-20T09:18:00.000Z	Rix_	snake	i'm in a pm with someone atm
2010-12-20T09:18:00.000Z	snake	Rix_	okay.
