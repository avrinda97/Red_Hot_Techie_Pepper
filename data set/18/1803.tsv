2011-07-15T20:29:00.000Z	roasted		If I'm running an Ubuntu server with 2 NICs and DHCP-server, would both NICs hand out IPs?
2011-07-15T20:30:00.000Z	Baltazaar	roasted	you choose what nic to use in dhcpd.conf
2011-07-15T20:31:00.000Z	Baltazaar	roasted	by default it listens to the first in your ethX list I think
2011-07-15T20:32:00.000Z	Baltazaar	roasted	ikonia yes if that is what he wants
2011-07-15T20:33:00.000Z	Baltazaar	roasted	tnx! ;-)
2011-07-15T20:36:00.000Z	Baltazaar	roasted	how many clients do you have?
2011-07-15T20:36:00.000Z	roasted	Baltazaar	60 minimal, upwards of 70 maybe
2011-07-15T20:36:00.000Z	Baltazaar	roasted	no problem then!
2011-07-15T20:44:00.000Z	Baltazaar	roasted	kindof
2011-07-15T20:44:00.000Z	roasted	Baltazaar	well if that's the case, I can SSH in and swap which eth is in charge and be done with it in 2 minutes...
2011-07-15T20:45:00.000Z	roasted	Baltazaar	not that I have true redundancy, but if that's the reasoning behind its existence, it seems like very little benefit.
2011-07-15T20:46:00.000Z	Baltazaar	roasted	well, it gives you redundancy, plus aggregation
2011-07-15T20:48:00.000Z	Baltazaar	roasted	Its the same as trunking in a way
2011-07-15T20:48:00.000Z	Baltazaar	roasted	agree. shooting birds with a cannon in your case
2011-07-15T20:53:00.000Z	Baltazaar	roasted	swap the beer for a joint, and I'm in!
2011-07-15T20:57:00.000Z	Baltazaar	roasted	2gb free
2011-07-15T20:58:00.000Z	roasted	Baltazaar	I thought he meant the app itself, not the space. space isn't going to be unlimited for everyone no matter where you go. :P
2011-07-15T20:59:00.000Z	Baltazaar	roasted	no, but then we do speak of both service and storage, and 2GB is free :-)
