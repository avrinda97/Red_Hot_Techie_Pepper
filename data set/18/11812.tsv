2007-09-15T15:54:00.000Z	Stettin|work		ok I messed up my installation somehow by moving a bad script to /bin/sh, when I boot I get ---Unable to execute "/bin/sh" for rcS: Permission denied<cr> rcS main process (2787) terminated with status 255, I tried accessingn /bin/sh from my live cd but the directory doesn't seem to exist, any suggestions here?
2007-09-15T15:54:00.000Z	Stettin|work		i'm pretty sure yes
2007-09-15T15:55:00.000Z	Stettin|work		the problem is the livecd doesn't show /bin/sh
2007-09-15T15:55:00.000Z	Stettin|work		says it doesnt exist
2007-09-15T15:55:00.000Z	Stettin|work		hmm
2007-09-15T15:55:00.000Z	Stettin|work		ok what about feisty
2007-09-15T15:56:00.000Z	Stettin|work		learn something every day
2007-09-15T15:57:00.000Z	Stettin|work		what would be the command to find my script, ls ar.sh -d or something?
2007-09-15T15:57:00.000Z	Stettin|work		or locate?
2007-09-15T15:57:00.000Z	jrib	Stettin|work	what do you mean?
2007-09-15T15:58:00.000Z	jrib	Stettin|work	sure, locate would work if the locate database is up to date (updatedb updates is)
2007-09-16T16:05:00.000Z	jrib	Stettin|work	if you move it to /bin/sh, then it's at /bin/sh.  Remake the symlink to dash
2007-09-16T16:06:00.000Z	jrib	Stettin|work	mv /bin/sh /bin/sh.backup && ln -s dash /bin/sh
2007-09-16T16:07:00.000Z	jrib	Stettin|work	how did you manage to overwrite /bin/sh as a command line move by the way?
2007-09-16T16:08:00.000Z	jrib	Stettin|work	ah I see.  It's a good idea to alias mv='mv -i'
2007-09-16T16:09:00.000Z	jrib	Stettin|work	join me in #ubuntu-classroom
2007-09-16T16:13:00.000Z	jrib	Stettin|work	/join #ubuntu-classroom   if you want to try to fix it
