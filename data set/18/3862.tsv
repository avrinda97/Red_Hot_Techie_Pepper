2009-10-08T05:42:00.000Z	balzac		hello
2009-10-08T05:43:00.000Z	balzac		I've had a bad time trying to use "remote desktop" functionality "vinagre" lately
2009-10-08T05:44:00.000Z	balzac		I think it's been screwed up, based on the fact I have failed to make it work having spent a long time seeking documentation and support
2009-10-08T05:44:00.000Z	balzac		I wish I could get some expert help making remote desktop work
2009-10-08T05:45:00.000Z	balzac		is anyone able to use "remote desktop" without expertise and configuration file "voodoo"?
2009-10-08T05:45:00.000Z	balzac		or if you had to struggle, can you share the arcane secrets of using "remote desktop"?
2009-10-08T05:46:00.000Z	mb_again_	balzac	are you connecting into your linux or out to another machine?
2009-10-08T05:46:00.000Z	balzac	mb_again_	I'd like to do both.
2009-10-08T05:47:00.000Z	balzac	mb_again_	thanks for responding. I try not to whine but I used to be able to use vinagre
2009-10-08T05:48:00.000Z	mb_again_	balzac	have had good success outgoing from linux to a windows RDP server with the remote tool that comes with ubuntu out of the box. all that is needed is to allow the connectino port through the firewalls involved
2009-10-08T05:48:00.000Z	balzac	mb_again_	do you use a command-line tool for firewall configuration?
2009-10-08T05:49:00.000Z	mb_again_	balzac	in to linux, not so good. I have a headless box beside me that I can export x windows to my main machine and monitor via ssh port forward (a default setting easily enabled) nothing else
2009-10-08T05:54:00.000Z	mb_again_	balzac	took me a minute to remember. from your own machine running any X server, ssh -X to the target machine. You will then have a command line. if you then activate any gui program, like this "firefox &" the window will open on your own desktop. It's not remote desktop, but should be excellent for admin support
2009-10-08T05:54:00.000Z	balzac	mb_again_	thanks for the clue
2009-10-08T05:55:00.000Z	mb_again_	balzac	there is a gotcha, if your own machine has tight security on the X server, you may have to open it up to allow the remote session in.
2009-10-08T05:55:00.000Z	mb_again_	balzac	an intersting idea ...
2009-10-08T05:56:00.000Z	mb_again_	balzac	that does not appear to be an application
2009-10-08T05:56:00.000Z	balzac	mb_again_	I was just trying to guess
