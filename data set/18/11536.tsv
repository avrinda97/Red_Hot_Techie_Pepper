2009-04-11T15:26:00.000Z	Lanlost		I am sharing internet (via firestarter)   to my desktop as for some  reason it can't connect to my router (too far away)
2009-04-11T15:26:00.000Z	Lanlost		however, my laptop can.. problem is.. I'm afraid I'm going to kill my LCD in my laptop having it on all the time
2009-04-11T15:26:00.000Z	Lanlost		but if I shut the lid.. bam. Internet disconnects
2009-04-11T15:26:00.000Z	Lanlost		from the laptop I mean.. therefore.. no connection to even share
2009-04-11T15:26:00.000Z	Lanlost		pisses me off because I went to power management and set everything accordingly
2009-04-11T15:27:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	Lanlost	what is the laptop model?
2009-04-11T15:28:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	Lanlost	have you read this http://www.1-script.com/forums/Increasing-Wireless-range-on-Presario-C500-article46223--25.htm
2009-04-11T15:28:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	Lanlost	seems your antenna is under the lid
2009-04-11T15:29:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	Lanlost	how about just telling it to turn the display off and not activate any screensaver?
2009-04-11T15:31:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	Lanlost	the person on that forum said that he had  the same problem until he switched to another WiFi channel
2009-04-11T15:31:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	Lanlost	that might help
2009-04-11T15:40:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	Lanlost	sounds to me a simple solution would be to get a wifi card or dongle for your tower :P
2009-04-11T15:41:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	Lanlost	perhaps they too should buy wifi cards or dongles :P
2009-04-11T15:44:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	Lanlost	not using it :)
2009-04-11T15:46:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	Lanlost	that is just the way it goes.. nothing lasts forever
2009-04-11T15:47:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	Lanlost	heh.. just using the blank screensaver would have been much easier
2009-04-11T15:48:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	Lanlost	laptops are typically like disposable cameras anyway.. they are just not as robust as a desktop.. or a good thinkpad for that matter
2009-04-11T15:52:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	Lanlost	sorry I could not be more help
