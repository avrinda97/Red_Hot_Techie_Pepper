2006-06-24T12:54:00.000Z	dibblego		will openoffice 2.0.2 run on dapper under GNOME?
2006-06-24T12:56:00.000Z	dibblego		I've tried several times but it segmentation faults each time
2006-06-24T12:57:00.000Z	dibblego		I get a seg fault when I sudo apt-get libstartup-notification0
2006-06-24T12:57:00.000Z	sethk	dibblego	that's a seg fault on apt-get, not on oofice
2006-06-24T12:57:00.000Z	dibblego	sethk	right
2006-08-06T08:53:00.000Z	sethk	dibblego	I've always used the driver from the nivida site, and not had a problem.
2006-08-06T08:54:00.000Z	dibblego	sethk	I used it with Breezy without a problem - but it still puts files in the wrong (old) place
2006-08-22T12:27:00.000Z	sethk	dibblego	not a kernel problem
2006-08-22T12:27:00.000Z	dibblego	sethk	sure, but why all of a sudden?
2006-08-22T12:27:00.000Z	sethk	dibblego	bad package, released today
2006-08-22T12:28:00.000Z	sethk	dibblego	see topic, or what I did a few lines ago, to fix it
2007-05-04T09:43:00.000Z	sethk	dibblego	you can if you use an editor that doesn't force this.  vi and gedit force it because the gnu compilers get really bitchy if it isn't there in a source file.
2007-05-04T09:44:00.000Z	dibblego	sethk	any suggestions?
2007-05-04T09:44:00.000Z	sethk	dibblego	you can write a program to do it easily enough.  why do you care?
2007-05-04T09:45:00.000Z	dibblego	sethk	because I am doing difference compression and I want to know my exact input
2007-05-04T09:45:00.000Z	sethk	dibblego	ok.  let me see ...
2007-05-04T09:46:00.000Z	sethk	dibblego	I vaguely recall a configuration option for it, but I'm not sure whether it was vim, or another vi, or even emacs.  let me check the man page.
2007-05-04T09:46:00.000Z	dibblego	sethk	emacs seems to have removed it for me, thanks
