2008-01-11T03:38:00.000Z	truna	mahout	put a space
2008-01-11T03:38:00.000Z	truna	mahout	put a space before the mount point directory
2008-01-11T03:40:00.000Z	mahout	truna	thats what i would guess
2008-01-11T03:40:00.000Z	mahout	truna	but i just put an ext3 partition on that drive
2008-01-11T03:40:00.000Z	truna	mahout	do you have /dev/sdb1 ?
2008-01-11T03:41:00.000Z	mahout	truna	i should but i dont know how to check
2008-01-11T03:41:00.000Z	truna	mahout	do you have a second drive installed?
2008-01-11T03:41:00.000Z	mahout	truna	physically yes
2008-01-11T03:42:00.000Z	truna	mahout	fdisk -l /dev/sdb  and see if it recognize your 2nd drive
2008-01-11T03:43:00.000Z	truna	mahout	and it would not mount /dev/sdb1 at all? can you just paste your exact command to mount this?
2008-01-11T03:44:00.000Z	mahout	truna	i ran the list, it says invalid option and some other useless stuff
2008-01-11T03:45:00.000Z	mahout	truna	i assume it means it cant find ne thing there
2008-01-11T03:45:00.000Z	truna	mahout	you are forgetting space between -l  and /dev
2008-01-11T03:47:00.000Z	truna	mahout	yeah its a good idea to pastebin it
2008-01-11T03:48:00.000Z	mahout	truna	and  nickrud: server@server:~$ fdisk -l /dev/sdb Cannot open /dev/sdb
2008-01-11T03:51:00.000Z	mahout	truna	and nickrud: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/51507/
2008-01-11T03:52:00.000Z	truna	mahout	 this /dev/sdb is a brand new hard disk? did you put a file system on it yet?
2008-01-11T03:53:00.000Z	mahout	truna	i formated to ext3
