2010-11-12T01:34:00.000Z	AJenbo		it has been like this for a few days now
2010-11-12T01:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AJenbo	or make an xorg.conf with 1 section defining the video driver then use SWcursor "true" ,if its bad try HWcursor "true"
2010-11-12T01:37:00.000Z	AJenbo	ActionParsnip	that controles the drawing of the mouse, it's not a drawing issue but an issue of clicking, i can move the mouse perfectly fine
2010-11-12T01:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AJenbo	ahhhh I see
2010-11-12T01:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AJenbo	are you using compiz?
2010-11-12T01:39:00.000Z	AJenbo	ActionParsnip	the issue is the same with metacity and compiz
2010-11-12T01:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AJenbo	hmm
2010-11-12T01:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AJenbo	tried a different browser to see if its only firefox?
2010-11-12T01:39:00.000Z	AJenbo	ActionParsnip	i think i might have installed some thing in firefox that is sniffing his mouse
2010-11-12T01:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AJenbo	ok then try: firefox -safe-mode ,this will disable all addons and plugins
2010-11-12T01:40:00.000Z	AJenbo	ActionParsnip	it also affects thunderbird, i might be able to make him switch away from firefox but not thunderbird
2010-11-12T01:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AJenbo	if its a plugin then it won't run then it will act ok then you can start hauling addons out
2010-11-12T01:43:00.000Z	AJenbo	ActionParsnip	now they are also getting it when opening Openoffice!
2010-11-12T01:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AJenbo	tried a different window manager? Or desktop?
2010-11-12T01:45:00.000Z	AJenbo	ActionParsnip	i considered it, but it's strange that it dosn't happen when using solitare and also happes with a different user
2010-11-12T01:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AJenbo	yes but if the user uses the same de/wm it may be causing the issue
2010-11-12T01:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	AJenbo	if you install xfce4, log off and logon to xfce it may help
2010-11-12T02:34:00.000Z	AJenbo	ActionParsnip	same problems under unity
