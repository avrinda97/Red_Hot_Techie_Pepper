2008-06-25T07:52:00.000Z	emma	unavailable	yes.
2008-06-25T07:32:00.000Z	unavailable	emma	do you mean playing it directly in fx? or using fx to open it with movie player?
2008-06-25T07:33:00.000Z	emma	unavailable	I used to be able to listen to it with some plugin in firefox, but I will be content to get any thing to play it in any manner at all.
2008-06-25T07:33:00.000Z	unavailable	emma	try pasting the link into movie player see what happens
2008-06-25T07:34:00.000Z	emma	unavailable	you mean totem?
2008-06-25T07:34:00.000Z	unavailable	emma	yep but you might get the same error i just did
2008-06-25T07:34:00.000Z	unavailable	emma	me too
2008-06-25T07:34:00.000Z	unavailable	emma	got a page that links to it??
2008-06-25T07:36:00.000Z	unavailable	emma	got a page that links to it??
2008-06-25T07:37:00.000Z	emma	unavailable	hmmm. Yes from the page itself, it looks like I was able to start something.
2008-06-25T07:37:00.000Z	emma	unavailable	I think maybe the page (it is a radio station in St. Louis) has changed it's protocol some how so that people have to be forced to navigate to the page in order to play it?
2008-06-25T07:38:00.000Z	unavailable	emma	maybe
2008-06-25T07:51:00.000Z	unavailable	emma	u still there?

2008-06-25T07:53:00.000Z	emma	unavailable	I think the most likely explanation at present is that the radio station changed it's stream protocol or link while I was unaware of it.
2008-06-25T07:53:00.000Z	emma	unavailable	yes try this, I found this also: mms://nick11a.surfernetwork.com/ktrs
2008-06-25T07:56:00.000Z	unavailable	emma	 kudos to coast to coast
2008-06-25T07:58:00.000Z	emma	unavailable	yeah now you have the link also. C2C should come on in about 2 hours.
