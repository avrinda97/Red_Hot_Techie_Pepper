2007-05-28T06:14:00.000Z	lockd	zbrown	allright, know of a way to install with no CD like wget or something?

2007-05-28T06:15:00.000Z	zbrown	lockd	hmmm why no cd drive?

2007-05-28T06:16:00.000Z	lockd	zbrown	is there a "from the net" install option
2007-05-28T06:16:00.000Z	zbrown	lockd	hmmm guess that issue stems back to your issues with the ipw3945d
2007-05-28T06:16:00.000Z	lockd	zbrown	no, but this box is going to the dumps
