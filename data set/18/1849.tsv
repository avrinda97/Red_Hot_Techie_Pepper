2010-10-30T12:52:00.000Z	Connor1		I'm sticking with Ubuntu
2010-10-30T12:52:00.000Z	Connor1		Fedora hated my laptop.
2010-10-30T12:52:00.000Z	Connor1		I'm doing a minimal install \o/
2010-10-30T12:53:00.000Z	Connor1		Hmm...
2010-10-30T12:53:00.000Z	blackshirt1	Connor1	what your problem
2010-10-30T12:53:00.000Z	Connor1		I started my Ubuntu minimal install
2010-10-30T12:53:00.000Z	Connor1		But I need to go to sleep because I have work today
2010-10-30T12:53:00.000Z	Connor1		What should I do?
2010-10-30T12:54:00.000Z	Connor1		It's at "Installing the base system"
2010-10-30T12:54:00.000Z	Connor1		I'd really rather not leave my laptop on for six hours.
2010-10-30T12:55:00.000Z	Connor1	blackshirt1	any suggestions?
2010-10-30T12:55:00.000Z	blackshirt1	Connor1	you want shutdown it ??

2010-10-30T12:55:00.000Z	Connor1		I'd rather continue this after work
2010-10-30T12:55:00.000Z	Connor1		Should I just do a hard shutdown of my laptop?
2010-10-30T12:55:00.000Z	blackshirt1		issuing halt -p
2010-10-30T12:56:00.000Z	blackshirt1		or shutdown on terminal
