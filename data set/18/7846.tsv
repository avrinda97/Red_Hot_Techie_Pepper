2007-11-07T22:47:00.000Z	arijus		how can i set max download speed limit?
2007-11-07T22:47:00.000Z	arijus		for all the system, not one program
2007-11-07T22:48:00.000Z	Pici	arijus	look into the trickle package and trickled
2007-11-07T22:55:00.000Z	arijus	Pici	i try trickle, but i don't think it works, cause i still can download with 30KB/s but i changed to 15KB/s
2007-11-07T22:55:00.000Z	Pici	arijus	I dont know then.
2007-11-07T23:01:00.000Z	arijus	Pici	does trickle have an ability to view what is the maximum download rate set now?
2007-11-07T23:01:00.000Z	Pici	arijus	Did you setup trickled as a service and configure the conf file?
2007-11-07T23:02:00.000Z	arijus	Pici	not
2007-11-07T23:03:00.000Z	Pici	arijus	Well, I havent setup the trickle daemon, but I've used the userspace version of it.  You are going to need to look at the manpages.
2007-11-07T23:10:00.000Z	arijus	Pici	damn, it just doesn't work for me
2007-11-07T23:10:00.000Z	arijus	Pici	what can i do wrong?
2007-11-07T23:11:00.000Z	Pici	arijus	Like I said, I havent used trickle as a service.
2007-11-07T23:12:00.000Z	Pici	arijus	I just know its possible to do that.
2007-11-07T23:12:00.000Z	arijus	Pici	how to enable trickle as a service?
2007-11-07T23:12:00.000Z	arijus	Pici	i just don't know
2007-11-07T23:12:00.000Z	Pici	arijus	I dont know, you need to look at the man pages for trickled.
2007-11-07T23:12:00.000Z	arijus	Pici	there isn't mentioned
2007-11-07T23:12:00.000Z	arijus	Pici	whatever, i'll try to find myself
