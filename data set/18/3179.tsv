2009-11-29T05:04:00.000Z	bae		please help! I upgrade to 9.1 and my partitions will not automount :(
2009-11-29T05:05:00.000Z	FCalderon	bae	which kind of partitions?
2009-11-29T05:05:00.000Z	bae	FCalderon	the root ext3 and possibly the swap
2009-11-29T05:06:00.000Z	FCalderon	bae	then how does it boot?
2009-11-29T05:06:00.000Z	bae	FCalderon	I can mount manually, but not something i want to do every time :\
2009-11-29T05:06:00.000Z	bae	FCalderon	in recovery mode I do it manually
2009-11-29T05:08:00.000Z	FCalderon	bae	use pastebin and copy your /etc/fstab there
2009-11-29T05:09:00.000Z	bae	FCalderon	pastebin?  (sorry dunno what it is)
2009-11-29T05:09:00.000Z	FCalderon	bae	pastebin.ca
2009-11-29T05:12:00.000Z	bae	FCalderon	http://paste.ubuntu.com/330669/   you will be able to tell i've been tooling with it
2009-11-29T05:12:00.000Z	FCalderon	bae	as per your pastebin, the root is mounter, what isn't is the swap
2009-11-29T05:13:00.000Z	FCalderon	bae	you need to remove the # in the 8th line
2009-11-29T05:13:00.000Z	bae	FCalderon	ok.  think thatll do it?
2009-11-29T05:13:00.000Z	FCalderon	bae	yes
2009-11-29T05:13:00.000Z	bae	FCalderon	ill give it a whirl.  ill be back
2009-11-29T05:14:00.000Z	FCalderon	bae	unless your root partition's id changed, but that's something that rarely happens
2009-11-29T05:14:00.000Z	FCalderon	bae	give it a try
2009-11-29T05:18:00.000Z	bae	FCalderon	no luck :\
