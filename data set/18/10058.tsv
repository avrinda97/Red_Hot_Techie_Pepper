2007-01-15T11:10:00.000Z	troymcmclure	jrib	i know what it is eheh
2007-01-15T11:07:00.000Z	jrib	troymcmclure	apache2 depends on other packages that have the "real" stuff.  Try apt-get autoremove
2007-01-15T11:08:00.000Z	troymcmclure	jrib	tried that too :(
2007-01-15T11:08:00.000Z	jrib	troymcmclure	I believe apache2-common is the package.  just do apt-cache depends apache2  and  dpkg -S /path/to/file/that/is/still/here  for hints
2007-01-15T11:09:00.000Z	jrib	troymcmclure	no, reinstalling will hardly ever fix anything in linux
2007-01-15T11:09:00.000Z	jrib	troymcmclure	have you been to the LAMP wiki page?
2007-01-15T11:09:00.000Z	troymcmclure	jrib	a server hack :-)
2007-01-15T11:10:00.000Z	troymcmclure	jrib	no :(
2007-01-15T11:10:00.000Z	jrib	troymcmclure	the important part is the wiki page...
2007-01-15T11:11:00.000Z	troymcmclure	jrib	yes: jeje i just googled but there's a couple
2007-01-15T11:11:00.000Z	jrib	troymcmclure	the one ubotu gave you
2007-01-15T11:17:00.000Z	troymcmclure	jrib	now simple .php's work, but the browser still want's to d/l phpmyadmin folder when accesing?!
2007-01-15T11:17:00.000Z	troymcmclure	jrib	ahh it needs to be added to apache2.conf right?
2007-01-15T11:18:00.000Z	jrib	troymcmclure	not sure, never set it up on ubuntu
2007-01-15T11:18:00.000Z	jrib	troymcmclure	read /usr/share/doc/phpmyadmin/*  maybe
2007-01-15T11:18:00.000Z	troymcmclure	jrib	done
