2009-04-19T22:33:00.000Z	pilif12p		How do i use a windows printer(one hooked up to a windows computer, as network) on ubuntu
2009-04-19T22:34:00.000Z	pilif12p		print from ubuntu to windows
2009-04-19T22:35:00.000Z	LjL	pilif12p	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsXPPrinter
2009-09-19T02:08:00.000Z	LjL	pilif12p	no, but ask about that in #ubuntu-ops rather than here
2009-09-19T02:10:00.000Z	LjL	pilif12p	it depends a lot
2009-09-19T02:10:00.000Z	LjL	pilif12p	some CD drives can be awfully slow if the CD is anything short of perfect
2009-09-19T02:10:00.000Z	LjL	pilif12p	which stage did it reach?
2009-09-19T02:26:00.000Z	LjL	pilif12p	what happened to your install
2009-09-19T02:26:00.000Z	pilif12p	LjL	I took off perl
2009-09-19T02:26:00.000Z	LjL	pilif12p	not good
2009-09-19T02:26:00.000Z	LjL	pilif12p	i'm sorry but i'm entirely unfamiliar with the new "recover" options in the live cd
2009-09-19T02:27:00.000Z	LjL	pilif12p	what i'd do is install the missing packages manually with dpkg, specifying the "--root" option
2009-11-24T21:35:00.000Z	pilif12p	LjL	From Moznet?!
2009-11-24T21:35:00.000Z	LjL	pilif12p	what?
2009-11-24T21:35:00.000Z	pilif12p	LjL	guess not
2009-11-24T21:37:00.000Z	pilif12p	LjL	are you the same ljl from moznet?
2009-11-24T21:37:00.000Z	LjL	pilif12p	no
