2005-12-16T13:26:00.000Z	rod		i have a .deb package, i'm not familar with ubuntu, how do you install the package??
2005-12-16T13:26:00.000Z	ompaul	rod	690 users in the channel so maybe :)
2005-12-16T13:26:00.000Z	ompaul	rod	where did you get the package
2005-12-16T13:26:00.000Z	rod	ompaul	it's skype
2005-12-16T13:26:00.000Z	ompaul	rod	you can't install any .deb and expect it to work
2005-12-16T13:26:00.000Z	rod	ompaul	if it doesn't work or if it does, is not my question
2005-12-16T13:29:00.000Z	ompaul	rod	the command you want is >>dpkg -i foo.deb<< but if it does not work or does something you can't deal with then really I think you will find that I am justified in my question, if it works straight off you are lucky :-)
2005-12-16T13:29:00.000Z	rod	ompaul	only have 2 dependencies to solve.  libqt and libstdc++
2005-12-16T13:31:00.000Z	ompaul	rod	you have no idea how many times that question has saved new users from damaging their box
2005-12-16T13:31:00.000Z	rod	ompaul	yeah that's dandy if you're worried about damaging your box
2005-12-16T13:33:00.000Z	rod	ompaul	i mean, is only an intel system after all
2005-12-16T13:38:00.000Z	ompaul	rod	try running "apt-cache search $foo"  then choose the place btw you need universe enabled  - /boot/grub/menu.lst like any other linux distro
2005-12-16T13:39:00.000Z	ompaul	rod	s/place/package
2006-05-27T07:04:00.000Z	ompaul	rod	^^^
2006-05-27T07:05:00.000Z	rod	ompaul	the solution is to chroot?
2006-05-27T07:05:00.000Z	ompaul	rod	they will not live with each other at all afik
2006-09-30T14:29:00.000Z	ompaul	rod	wrong channel #ubuntu+1
