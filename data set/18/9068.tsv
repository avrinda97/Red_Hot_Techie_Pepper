2008-06-07T23:46:00.000Z	Lapinux	rayray	i've used this brand forever, and i've used them in linux many times already
2008-06-07T23:48:00.000Z	Lapinux	rayray	i used k3b last time i burnt a disc, its been a little while since i did it though, and i also just tried brasero
2008-06-07T23:50:00.000Z	Lapinux	rayray	its odd that it passes simulation but not a normal burn, i did notice when it simulates it doesnt do the "optimum power calibration" that the normal burn does
2008-06-07T23:51:00.000Z	Lapinux	rayray	whats a joke, that people are having these sort of problems?
2008-06-07T23:51:00.000Z	Lapinux	rayray	i think its working
2008-06-07T23:52:00.000Z	Lapinux	rayray	at 8x for a 52x disc
2008-06-07T23:53:00.000Z	Lapinux	rayray	nope, i forgot to uncheck simulate, time to try again
2008-06-07T23:54:00.000Z	Lapinux	rayray	well, it looks like the 8x burn is going to work
