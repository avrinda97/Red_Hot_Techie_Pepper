2008-10-28T22:23:00.000Z	armageddon	bobbob1016	are you talking about digital dvb ?
2008-10-28T22:24:00.000Z	armageddon	bobbob1016	have you got experience with vdr ?
2008-10-28T22:25:00.000Z	bobbob1016	armageddon	As in what?  I missed the beginning of your question.  I just installed Mythbuntu, and hooked my coax up to my tuner, no real config, apart from saying "My tuner is here"
2008-10-28T22:26:00.000Z	armageddon	bobbob1016	wel, i am trying to compile de v4l dvb module drivers and vdr and some plugins for vdr
2008-10-28T22:26:00.000Z	armageddon	bobbob1016	but i am using ubuntu-server, so no xx-environment
2008-10-28T22:26:00.000Z	armageddon	bobbob1016	one x
2008-10-28T22:27:00.000Z	armageddon	bobbob1016	any idea of that ?
2008-10-28T22:28:00.000Z	bobbob1016	armageddon	Why're you using server?  Why not normal ubuntu and then remove the gnome-y things?  So you can set it up on a system with packages meant for users, that might make it easier to do what you need (non-server stuff)
2008-10-28T22:28:00.000Z	armageddon	bobbob1016	well, it consists of only server things :P
2008-10-28T22:29:00.000Z	armageddon	bobbob1016	it should becom a streaming server for at the moment one ff but later up to three ff or 2 ff and 2 budget dvb-s cards
2008-10-28T22:29:00.000Z	bobbob1016	armageddon	Maybe I don't know what vdl is, but I know v4l is video4linux, and recording TV isn't a server thing.
2008-10-28T22:30:00.000Z	bobbob1016	armageddon	I don't know much about that stuff to be honest.  I just have my Mythbuntu box record to my FreeNAS Server
2008-10-28T22:31:00.000Z	armageddon	bobbob1016	well, why is such a thing then called streaming SERVER ? :P
2008-10-28T22:31:00.000Z	armageddon	bobbob1016	the thing i try to compile is called vdr
2008-10-28T22:32:00.000Z	armageddon	bobbob1016	and since that machine is my 4 TB file server at the same time, and the mpeg2 stream can directly be recorded to the hard disk, it makes sense to do so :P
2008-10-28T22:32:00.000Z	bobbob1016	armageddon	Ubuntu Server != Streaming SERVER, Ubuntu Server == Generic SERVER according to what I know.  ANY server or fileshare CAN be streaming,
2008-10-28T22:33:00.000Z	bobbob1016	armageddon	I'd do the recording on another machine to the SERVER's drive that it SERVES.  Recording video is not in the roll of a server directly, it can be added, but it isn't easy.
