2006-08-25T09:18:00.000Z	BlueEagle		ramikassab: did you get qt-dev?
2006-08-25T09:18:00.000Z	RamiKassab	BlueEagle	I believe I did, let me try to install it and see if it says it's already installed
2006-08-25T09:19:00.000Z	RamiKassab	BlueEagle	qt-dev doesn't exist?
2006-08-25T09:20:00.000Z	RamiKassab	BlueEagle	thanks, they have qt3-dev-tools and qt4-dev-tools... are either of those correct?
2006-08-25T09:22:00.000Z	RamiKassab	BlueEagle	well damn I don't know which to install. does it cause problems when I just start installing whatever I "think" may be it?
2006-08-25T09:23:00.000Z	RamiKassab	BlueEagle	I'm gonna install libqt4-dev to see if that works
2006-08-25T09:23:00.000Z	RamiKassab	BlueEagle	that may be why I was having a hard time compiling Quasar for accounting as well
2006-08-25T09:26:00.000Z	RamiKassab	BlueEagle	what's the diff between libqt3-mt-dev and just libqt3-dev?
2006-08-25T09:26:00.000Z	RamiKassab	BlueEagle	Quasar is a well know big accounting application... kdocker is also a big one
2006-08-25T09:26:00.000Z	RamiKassab	BlueEagle	do I need to have a specific processor for that?
2006-08-25T09:27:00.000Z	RamiKassab	BlueEagle	probably hyperthreaded processor correct?
2006-08-25T09:28:00.000Z	RamiKassab	BlueEagle	so in general it is better to install the mt version on any machine?
2006-08-25T09:38:00.000Z	RamiKassab	BlueEagle	ok so libqt3-mt-dev helped with make
2006-08-25T09:38:00.000Z	RamiKassab	BlueEagle	I'm still getting one error though and I don't know where to start with it
2006-08-25T09:38:00.000Z	RamiKassab	BlueEagle	good news is, I can now compile Quasar at least :)
2006-08-25T09:38:00.000Z	RamiKassab	BlueEagle	ok I'll look around... mind if I bother you if nothing turns up?
2006-08-25T09:40:00.000Z	RamiKassab	BlueEagle	ok thank you for the help man
2006-08-25T09:40:00.000Z	RamiKassab	BlueEagle	take care
