2009-08-30T07:21:00.000Z	icarus		so i went to best buy today. it was a nice store ,very clean not to many people.. and i noticed  they had sale on 8 gb flash drives they were reduced  down to $9.00. so i bought one thinking how insuperably lucky I was. but when i plug it in i notice that 0.5gb is filled with this bloatware known as u3 what do i do ?
