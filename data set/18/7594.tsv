2011-04-12T12:42:00.000Z	soreau	anthony_	Are you running cairo-dock or any other dok on bottom?
2011-04-12T12:43:00.000Z	anthony_	soreau	  yeah.  cairo, and im sure that's the problem. but some windows open in full.   do you happen to know what setting i have screwed up?
2011-04-12T12:44:00.000Z	soreau	anthony_	There is a setting in cairo-dock to control this behavior
2011-04-12T12:44:00.000Z	anthony_	soreau	  im sure there is, but after 2 hrs, i can't find it. i AM and idiot, no doubt, but...
2011-04-12T12:46:00.000Z	anthony_	soreau	plus, when cairo-dock is not running, i have this problem!!
2011-04-12T12:48:00.000Z	anthony_	soreau	cairo-dock is shut down, and this problem persists
2011-04-12T12:49:00.000Z	soreau	anthony_	cairo-dock settings>visibility>visibility <-- dont put reserve space for dock
2011-04-12T12:52:00.000Z	anthony_	soreau	  there is no such setting under "visibility"  / maybe in gconf-editor?
2011-04-12T12:52:00.000Z	soreau	anthony_	cairo-dock settings>visibility>visibility <-- dont put reserve space for dock
2011-04-12T12:52:00.000Z	soreau	anthony_	If you cant find that I dont know how else to tell you. I already looked it up for you
2011-04-12T12:53:00.000Z	soreau	anthony_	and I am going to sleep, good night. Ask in #cairo-dock if it is still causing problems
2011-04-12T12:53:00.000Z	anthony_	soreau	o.k thanks anyway
