2010-02-03T03:16:00.000Z	tarski	Ingsoc	just use the terminal to do large copies
2010-02-03T03:17:00.000Z	Ingsoc	tarski	I have tried using cp in the terminal and I get the same problem.
2010-02-03T03:18:00.000Z	tarski	Ingsoc	youre using 64-bit 9.10 yes?
2010-02-03T03:18:00.000Z	Ingsoc	tarski	yes
2010-02-03T03:18:00.000Z	tarski	Ingsoc	as you can see this is a known issue, so try some suggestions in the forums
2010-02-03T03:19:00.000Z	Ingsoc	tarski	I have tried them all. I have been googling this issue for almost 8 months. I just wish it would get fixed! I have found this problem in the forums going all the way back to 7.04!
2010-02-03T03:20:00.000Z	tarski	Ingsoc	I'm using 32-bit, and I don't have this issue
2010-02-03T03:20:00.000Z	tarski	Ingsoc	in the 8 months you could have developed your own fix and submitted it as a patch ;)
2010-02-03T03:21:00.000Z	Ingsoc	tarski	If I knew what the problem wa I would have.
2010-02-03T03:22:00.000Z	Ingsoc	tarski	this is so frustrating, I am trying to copy a movie onto a thumb drive for a flight tomorrow. It is a 3 hour flight, copying the file? Time remaining: 16 hours. WTF
2010-02-03T03:23:00.000Z	tarski	Ingsoc	then try using 32-bit, again I don't have this issue
2010-02-03T03:25:00.000Z	tarski	Ingsoc	have you tried: sudo rmmod ehci_hcd and sudo modprobe ehci_hcd?
2010-02-03T03:26:00.000Z	Ingsoc	tarski	I would but I would like to know how to undo that in case it breaks something else.
2010-02-03T03:28:00.000Z	tarski	Ingsoc	well it's a known fix
