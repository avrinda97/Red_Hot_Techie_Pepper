2008-09-26T07:11:00.000Z	yowshi		is there a way of disabling fsck?
2008-09-26T07:11:00.000Z	yowshi		or manually running it without rebooting or damaging a partition?
2008-09-26T07:11:00.000Z	dr_willis	yowshi	 yes to both questions.
2008-09-26T07:12:00.000Z	yowshi	dr_willis	cool would love to know how. fsck is the reason i hate rebooting
2008-09-26T07:12:00.000Z	dr_willis	yowshi	  if you are fscking at every boot.. you got somthing weird going on.
2008-09-26T07:13:00.000Z	dr_willis	yowshi	 if using that ext2/3 tool for windows.. i suggest  only using it as needed.. :)  ive seen it cause issues.. you might want to boot a live cd and manually fsck all filesystems also
2008-09-26T07:13:00.000Z	yowshi	dr_willis	not every reboot no. but every reboot is one reboot closer to the bloody fsck running and some of my partitions are over 200 gigs.
2008-09-26T07:14:00.000Z	dr_willis	yowshi	 you can set the #'s btweeen fscks and you can easially set some drives to be a different #.  or disable it competely (not reccomdnede)
2008-09-26T07:14:00.000Z	yowshi	dr_willis	200+ gigs takes a while for fsck to get through where my computer does nothing but display the counter for like 20-30 minutes
2008-09-26T07:14:00.000Z	dr_willis	yowshi	 i run limnux on my laptop that i amconstantly booting up.. and i  only see it fsck rarely.. like once a month or so.
2008-09-26T07:14:00.000Z	yowshi	dr_willis	what exactly does fsck do
2008-09-26T07:14:00.000Z	dr_willis	yowshi	 Hmm.. 250gb hd here.. takes about 3 min to check at boot time for me.
2008-09-26T07:15:00.000Z	yowshi	dr_willis	odd mine takes alot longer then 3 minutes
2008-12-22T09:23:00.000Z	dr_willis	yowshi	 deb file = use the packge manager tools.. From Source = Depends.. 'make uninstall' in the source dir.. MIGHT remove it.
2008-12-22T09:24:00.000Z	yowshi	dr_willis	the programme doesnt show up in synaptic
2008-12-22T09:24:00.000Z	dr_willis	yowshi	 if you used the .deb it should..
2008-12-22T09:25:00.000Z	dr_willis	yowshi	 ty the console based apt tools  perhaps apt-get remove programname
2008-12-22T09:26:00.000Z	yowshi	dr_willis	thanks that worked
