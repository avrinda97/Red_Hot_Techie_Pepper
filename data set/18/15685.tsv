2005-02-09T16:49:00.000Z	snowblink	aburlet	check /etc/alternatives
2005-02-09T16:50:00.000Z	aburlet	snowblink	that's the point, /etc/alternatives/vi points to /usr/bin/vim, whoch doesn't exist ... although package vim is installed
2005-02-09T16:51:00.000Z	snowblink	aburlet	I had it disappear on me when I was on hoary
2005-02-09T16:51:00.000Z	aburlet	snowblink	guess what, I'm on hoarry
2005-02-09T16:52:00.000Z	aburlet	snowblink	any solutions ?
2005-02-09T16:52:00.000Z	snowblink	aburlet	not that I could find. Happened to me after I installed KDE
2005-02-09T16:53:00.000Z	aburlet	snowblink	yep, I saw sth like ... "diversion by kvim from: /usr/bin/vim to /usr/bin/vim.org" know what that means ?
2005-02-09T16:54:00.000Z	snowblink	aburlet	hmmm. Did you install kvim or KDE?
2005-02-09T16:54:00.000Z	aburlet	snowblink	kde, and I got kvim for free (part of kde addons)
2005-02-09T16:55:00.000Z	snowblink	aburlet	I think this qualifies as a bug
2005-02-09T16:55:00.000Z	aburlet	snowblink	if you want dhcp for eth1, check /etc/network/interfaces to be sure
2005-02-09T16:55:00.000Z	aburlet	snowblink	sorry wrong person
2005-02-09T16:56:00.000Z	aburlet	snowblink	you mean that after 3 days of ubuntu I should get a bugzilla account ....
2005-02-09T16:57:00.000Z	snowblink	aburlet	you're on hoary...
2005-02-09T16:57:00.000Z	snowblink	aburlet	I switched back to warty
2005-02-09T16:57:00.000Z	aburlet	snowblink	yes, but it's my 12th bugzilla account on earth, that is too much :)
2005-02-09T16:58:00.000Z	aburlet	snowblink	do you know if there is a kubuntu status page ?
2005-02-09T16:58:00.000Z	snowblink	aburlet	dunno
