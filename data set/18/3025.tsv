2010-06-29T22:41:00.000Z	offy		I changed fstab to mount sdb1 to /home/david/Desktop but the permissions are all root
2010-06-29T22:42:00.000Z	offy		I can't change permissions of the mounted drive
2010-06-29T22:42:00.000Z	offy		i tried chown -R david:users
2010-06-29T22:42:00.000Z	unop	offy	what filesystem?
2010-06-29T22:42:00.000Z	offy		ntfs
2010-06-29T22:43:00.000Z	offy	unop	ntfs
2010-06-29T22:43:00.000Z	unop	offy	you can't do that then -- ntfs does not understand unix permissions
2010-06-29T22:43:00.000Z	offy	unop	Before I formatted I had it working.
2010-06-29T22:44:00.000Z	unop	offy	to accept the chown command, i don't think so.
2010-06-29T22:44:00.000Z	offy	unop	Thanks. I'll probably change it to ext4
2010-06-29T22:44:00.000Z	unop	offy	but first, why are you wanting to change the owners here?
2010-06-29T22:45:00.000Z	offy	unop	My second harddrive is used for files only. So I want all files saved there that are on desktop.
2010-06-29T22:45:00.000Z	offy	unop	They are all root right now
2010-06-29T22:45:00.000Z	unop	offy	you're using the ntfs drive as a backup?
2010-06-29T22:45:00.000Z	offy	unop	yes
2010-06-29T22:46:00.000Z	unop	offy	you could use tar to create the backups -- and store the tar files on the ntfs drive - you'll preserve permissions and ownership that way.
2010-06-29T22:46:00.000Z	unop	offy	but yea, probably much easier if you converted to EXTx
2010-06-29T22:47:00.000Z	offy	unop	ok
