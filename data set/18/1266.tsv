2011-04-16T14:06:00.000Z	oldtimer		that is his ? ,
2011-04-16T14:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	oldtimer	 Huh? Lubuntu perhaps may ork well on that old a machine. but more ram would help a lot.
2011-04-16T14:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	oldtimer	 I hope you are not asking a lot for it..
2011-04-16T14:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	oldtimer	 Most people will proberly be wanting windows of some kind. Theres   other minimal linux disrots that can work.
2011-04-16T14:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	oldtimer	 tinyxp is not exactly 'legal' or related to Ubuntu support. :)
2011-04-16T14:19:00.000Z	oldtimer	Dr_Willis	doc you and you friend fixed this old timer up good , ill be back for a check up
2011-04-16T14:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	oldtimer	 you dont have it working yet... :)
2011-04-16T14:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	oldtimer	 Puppy Linux may be better for that low ram system. but they got their own channel.
2011-04-16T14:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	oldtimer	 dident we cover this earlier? :) Lubuntu wouldbe the lightest full ubuntu you could install on a low end system.
2011-04-16T14:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	oldtimer	 otherwise you ar going to be doing a lot of tweaking byhand to get a working desktop
2011-04-16T14:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	oldtimer	 Definatly find more ram from some junker/dead box.
2011-04-16T15:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	oldtimer	 thats debateable..  if you owned a copy. some say 'yes' you can.. but that is not an offical 'legal' release of XP by MS..  so its up to you.
2011-04-16T15:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	oldtimer	 downloading windows from a non-legal source.. is well.. not legal  and proberly better asked about in #windows not here.
2011-04-16T15:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	oldtimer	 i just said  #windows :) thats the channelname
2011-04-16T15:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	oldtimer	 You will get NO official support from MS for tinyxp.. or even for XP any more i think..
2011-04-16T15:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	oldtimer	 tinyxp is a pirated/hacked version of XP.
2011-04-16T15:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	oldtimer	 its proberly regiestered nick only.
