2008-01-29T23:51:00.000Z	|Torg|	hotmonkeyluv	tar files are tape archives, ala old school way to write to tape.  It is not compressed, not one tiny little bit.  Gzip and Bzaip are two of many compression propgrams, hence a tar.gz, tgz or tar,bz file is a compressed tar file
2008-01-29T23:51:00.000Z	hotmonkeyluv	|Torg|	oh
2008-01-29T23:52:00.000Z	hotmonkeyluv	|Torg|	well, he/she still needs to do the gz part first, not the .tar
2008-01-29T23:53:00.000Z	|Torg|	hotmonkeyluv	Linux tar has gzip buildin, or you can gzip -cd <file> | tar xvf -
2008-01-29T23:53:00.000Z	hotmonkeyluv	|Torg|	interesting (the stuff you learn in irc is amazing)
2008-01-29T23:53:00.000Z	hotmonkeyluv	|Torg|	hmmm
2008-01-29T23:54:00.000Z	hotmonkeyluv	|Torg|	Can you help me with this? I have a printing question. It seems like it should be easy, but so far it hasn't been easy. When printing from one ubuntu machine to another ubuntu machine (which has the printer) what protocol do I need to use? LDP, samba, what?
2008-01-29T23:55:00.000Z	|Torg|	hotmonkeyluv	check out cups, if you want one to be a print spooler, ldp, if you want both to be able to print but dont care about spooler just install the printer
2008-01-29T23:56:00.000Z	hotmonkeyluv	|Torg|	so, would i select "other"? there is no option for cups
2008-01-29T23:57:00.000Z	|Torg|	hotmonkeyluv	other in what?
2008-01-29T23:57:00.000Z	hotmonkeyluv	|Torg|	in the add printer dialogue thingie
2008-01-29T23:57:00.000Z	|Torg|	hotmonkeyluv	in what program are you adding a printer?
2008-01-29T23:58:00.000Z	hotmonkeyluv	|Torg|	the built in printer configuration tool
2008-01-29T23:58:00.000Z	|Torg|	hotmonkeyluv	opena  browser and in it put http://127.0.1.1:631
2008-01-29T23:59:00.000Z	hotmonkeyluv	|Torg|	didn't work
2008-01-30T00:00:00.000Z	|Torg|	hotmonkeyluv	then you probbly do not have cups installed. that or its not running
