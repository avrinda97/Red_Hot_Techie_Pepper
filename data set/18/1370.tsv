2011-03-18T02:49:00.000Z	mrdeb		is 10.10 worth installing now that 11.04 is coming?
2011-03-18T02:49:00.000Z	Polah	mrdeb	perhaps not, 11.04 is only a month away
2011-03-18T02:54:00.000Z	mrdeb	Polah	yes
2011-03-18T02:54:00.000Z	Polah	mrdeb	mhm, I just found the article again
2011-03-18T03:06:00.000Z	Polah	mrdeb	It's the later version; so I'd assume it makes mostly improvements
2011-04-09T20:42:00.000Z	Polah	mrdeb	Better to be on the safe side and assign at least 2GB to swap just in case
2011-06-08T07:28:00.000Z	Polah	mrdeb	Indeed, RAID offers data redundancy (unless it's plain RAID 0)
2011-06-08T07:29:00.000Z	Polah	mrdeb	That's not the same. RAID 1 for example has online mirroring, two drives with the same data. If one drive fails, the data is still available on the second drive. With a USB backup, you need to go and replace all that data on a new drive.
2011-06-08T07:29:00.000Z	Polah	mrdeb	RAID is especially important for servers and whatnot in which any downtime would be critical.
2011-06-08T07:30:00.000Z	Polah	mrdeb	You destroy the data and then you can return it under warranty.
2011-06-08T07:30:00.000Z	mrdeb	Polah	you cant return it ever, bec they can still recover it
2011-06-08T07:30:00.000Z	Polah	mrdeb	DBAN on the drive, or dd from /dev/null over the partition table and all the data.
2011-06-08T07:33:00.000Z	mrdeb	Polah	i read it can be done. so i recommend destroying or burning drives
2011-06-08T07:34:00.000Z	Polah	mrdeb	It's impossible to recover data if it's totally destroyed. It's doubly impossible if you want to do two passes. You can't read data if it isn't there.
2011-06-08T07:34:00.000Z	mrdeb	Polah	thre are magnetic traces
2011-06-08T07:35:00.000Z	Polah	mrdeb	Not if you want to do anything more than single pass.
2011-06-08T07:35:00.000Z	mrdeb	Polah	what
2011-08-22T01:33:00.000Z	Polah	mrdeb	Not if you have another environment installed, or install another one. You are by no means locked into using Unity.
