2010-04-21T04:40:00.000Z	AdmiralDeath		is it normal for ubuntu to take a while to boot the install cycle?
2010-04-21T04:42:00.000Z	AdmiralDeath		it hass been reading the CRrom for the past 20 minutes
2010-04-21T04:42:00.000Z	d_b_d	AdmiralDeath	verify your written copy (md5 the checksum)
2010-04-21T04:43:00.000Z	d_b_d	AdmiralDeath	or try switching to a different runlevel and see if something interesting is there
2010-04-21T04:44:00.000Z	d_b_d	AdmiralDeath	make sure that your motherboard supports booting from usb (and that your BIOS is set accordingly)
2010-04-21T04:48:00.000Z	d_b_d	AdmiralDeath	did you burn on DVD or CD? Try burning on CD (if you burnt on DVD before). Try a slow speed burning, md5 the hash of the disc contents after burning etc...
2010-04-21T04:49:00.000Z	d_b_d	AdmiralDeath	can't you order an Ubuntu disc from launchpad anymore (and wait a little)?
2010-04-21T04:49:00.000Z	d_b_d	AdmiralDeath	maybe they stopped shipping them, but they sent out ubuntu discs for free

2010-04-21T04:50:00.000Z	d_b_d	AdmiralDeath	then you're sure it's not you're writer
2010-04-21T04:52:00.000Z	d_b_d	AdmiralDeath	try switching to runlevel 3 while the install fails/hangs (ctrl + alt + f3). Check the error logs
2010-04-21T04:53:00.000Z	d_b_d	AdmiralDeath	where does it fail then (specific?)
2010-04-21T04:55:00.000Z	d_b_d	AdmiralDeath	when it hangs (when installing) try pressing ctrl+alt+f3 (that should take you to runlevel 3). list what you see here
2010-04-21T04:58:00.000Z	d_b_d	AdmiralDeath	may be a broken disc according to http://www.linuxforums.org/forum/mandriva-linux-help/26241-cd-crashes-invalid-argument-mount-dev-loop0-solved.html (I would try taking out the cdrom / dvd players one by one)
2010-04-21T04:59:00.000Z	d_b_d	AdmiralDeath	a broken cd-romplayer I meant (not really a disc)
2010-04-21T05:01:00.000Z	d_b_d	AdmiralDeath	ok, I'll try to stay on this channel. I have no experience with this specific error but I should be able to help you through general linux troubleshooting
2010-04-21T05:06:00.000Z	d_b_d	AdmiralDeath	hopes it works for you
2010-04-21T05:06:00.000Z	d_b_d	AdmiralDeath	shiny new ubuntu installation coming up soon ;-)
