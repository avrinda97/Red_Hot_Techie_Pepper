2005-05-25T06:54:00.000Z	CrippsFX	user1000	try doing a google search: "dpkg error 141" ;)
2005-05-25T06:55:00.000Z	user1000	CrippsFX	no browsers, i'm not in x
2005-05-25T06:55:00.000Z	CrippsFX	user1000	elinks, links, lynx ......
2005-05-25T06:55:00.000Z	user1000	CrippsFX	i'd rather get in x, heh
2005-05-25T06:55:00.000Z	CrippsFX	user1000	plenty of command line browsers ...one of them is guaranteed to be installed by default.
2005-05-25T06:56:00.000Z	CrippsFX	user1000	well, if looking something up on google will help you get X, then it's definitely worth a shot.
2005-05-25T06:58:00.000Z	user1000	CrippsFX	okay, lynx gets me google, but google isn't helpful, i don't even know what fink is
2005-05-25T07:00:00.000Z	user1000	CrippsFX	ask google for the search you gave me yourself :)  the first few hits are about fink mailing lists on sourceforge
2005-05-25T07:00:00.000Z	CrippsFX	user1000	yeah, I was about to say "I see what you mean" ... but I messed up my input ;)
2005-05-25T07:01:00.000Z	CrippsFX	user1000	I was also going to say that the first link you see isn't neccesarily the best one. look for a description that most closely describes your problem.
2005-05-25T07:01:00.000Z	user1000	CrippsFX	yeah, the thing is (if you're on that page) there's none that seem to fit
2005-05-25T07:02:00.000Z	CrippsFX	user1000	I'll be searching too ... I just never used w3m, so its kind of akward for me. I'm setting up links right now :)
2005-05-25T07:02:00.000Z	user1000	CrippsFX	i think you can use firefox or something if you have x there, heh
2005-05-25T07:02:00.000Z	CrippsFX	user1000	yeah .... but cli is fun ;)
2005-05-25T07:03:00.000Z	user1000	CrippsFX	though i do recall google sends me to a firefox-specific page, so maybe they do chnage th results based on browser :(
2005-05-25T07:08:00.000Z	CrippsFX	user1000	okay ... so I guess there isn't that much specifically pertaining to "error 141" where I looked .... but I am led to believe that it is some form of "pre-dependency" problem.
2005-05-25T07:09:00.000Z	user1000	CrippsFX	okay, as bedst as i can figure out, the postinst of xorg-common was written for hoary, and refuses to work with a breezy system
2005-05-25T07:10:00.000Z	CrippsFX	user1000	makes sense. you could try a debian (or source) based release of Xorg ;)
