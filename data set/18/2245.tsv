2010-07-11T17:11:00.000Z	melroy		Hello, I have setup RAID via bios & Raid 1 mirror setup on my 770-C45
2010-07-11T17:11:00.000Z	melroy		and still gon an error on failed to create a file system
2010-07-11T17:11:00.000Z	ikonia	melroy	ok, so you're using a technology called fake raid
2010-07-11T17:11:00.000Z	ikonia	melroy	fakeraid has very poor support in Linux, and in my opinion personally, it's a bad technology in general
2010-07-11T17:12:00.000Z	ikonia	melroy	it's fake raid, not software raid
2010-07-11T17:13:00.000Z	ikonia	melroy	certainly not hardware raid
2010-07-11T17:14:00.000Z	melroy	ikonia	how do you know for use it's not hardware raid or software raid
2010-07-11T17:14:00.000Z	ikonia	melroy	because a.) you said the make/model b.) home motherboards do not come with hardware raid
2010-07-11T17:14:00.000Z	melroy	ikonia	ok thx :)
2010-07-11T17:16:00.000Z	melroy	ikonia	You know if fakeraid can work anyway with my model? Please say yes .. :(
2010-07-11T17:17:00.000Z	ikonia	melroy	read the pm ubottu sent you. Fakeraid in general on linux is very poor. In my personal opinion fakeraid is a bad technology totally.
2010-07-11T17:39:00.000Z	melroy	ikonia	How many CPU (%) uses software raid 1 using AMD Athlon II X3 425 / 2.7 GHz? On a system/server with really much I/O ?
2010-07-11T17:41:00.000Z	ikonia	melroy	it will use as much cpu as it needs
2010-07-11T17:41:00.000Z	melroy	ikonia	any idea how much, I have no idea (1% 20% 70%)?
2010-07-11T17:42:00.000Z	ikonia	melroy	it should be minimal
2010-07-11T17:42:00.000Z	melroy	ikonia	ok thx
2010-07-11T17:43:00.000Z	ikonia	melroy	you won't even see it as a % unless it's doing an array rebuild
2010-07-11T18:18:00.000Z	ikonia	melroy	totally
