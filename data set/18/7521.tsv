2007-12-26T02:03:00.000Z	shade052		is there any good GUI which tells about the network bandwidth that systems on the local area network are using
2007-12-26T02:03:00.000Z	Slart	shade052	systems as in all other computers ? or you're just interested in your own computers network usage?
2007-12-26T02:04:00.000Z	shade052		Slart:other computer on the LAN
2007-12-26T02:05:00.000Z	Slart	shade052	I would look into some kind of snmp solution.. there are several application for gathering the info and presenting it .. cacti is one.. there are several others
2007-12-26T02:07:00.000Z	shade052		Slart:does traceroute by any chance give enough info to figure this out?
2007-12-26T02:08:00.000Z	Slart	shade052	traceroute only gives you ip's and ping times afaik.. you can't tell anything about network usage from that, afaik
2007-12-26T02:09:00.000Z	shade052		Slart:sorry i meant tcpdump
2007-12-26T02:09:00.000Z	Slart	shade052	I think you'll have to get that info either from a switch, if all traffic passes through that switch, or by asking all the computers directly
2007-12-26T02:09:00.000Z	Slart	shade052	I think tcpdump only sees traffic coming to your machine
2007-12-26T02:10:00.000Z	shade052	Slart	Well, its a switch. but how do you talk to a switch
2007-12-26T02:10:00.000Z	shade052		Slart:tahat is how do you get the info from switch
2007-12-26T02:10:00.000Z	Slart	shade052	perhaps it talks snmp? is it a big impressive switch you payed lots of money for? =) if that is the case it probably does
2007-12-26T02:11:00.000Z	Slart	shade052	what's the purpose of this? limiting bandwidth at the office? keeping your kids in line at home? =)
2007-12-26T02:13:00.000Z	shade052		Slart:Sorry if i offended you. but i thought only routers have a identity and switches dont....and i dont have kids :) its for learning something
2007-12-26T02:14:00.000Z	Slart	shade052	no offence taken .. what do you mean by identity? ip-number?
2007-12-26T02:15:00.000Z	shade052		Slart:yes
2007-12-26T02:15:00.000Z	shade052		Slart:or a resolvable name
2007-12-26T02:15:00.000Z	Slart	shade052	routerse usually have an ip.. yes.. some expensive switches have that too.. so you can setup stuff and get just the kind of information you're looking for
