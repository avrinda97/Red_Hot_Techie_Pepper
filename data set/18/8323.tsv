2008-02-18T02:31:00.000Z	onesandzeros		hello all.  Using the ubuntu or kubuntu -alternate isos, does the text-based installer allow you to use existing disk partitions without formatting them?  the standard installers don't.
2008-02-18T02:32:00.000Z	nucco	onesandzeros	the standard installers allow that too.
2008-02-18T02:32:00.000Z	nucco	onesandzeros	but you can't install to an unformatted '/' and '/boot' partition.
2008-02-18T02:32:00.000Z	onesandzeros	nucco	right
2008-02-18T02:32:00.000Z	onesandzeros	nucco	that's what I need to get around
2008-02-18T02:33:00.000Z	nucco	onesandzeros	i don't think you can get around that.
2008-02-18T02:33:00.000Z	nucco	onesandzeros	nothing really important shoudl reside there IMO, except config files which you can back up and restore
2008-02-18T02:33:00.000Z	onesandzeros	nucco	I've got /oldroot and /oldhome which I don't really have the means to backup or put elsewhere at the moment.
2008-02-18T02:34:00.000Z	onesandzeros	nucco	any idea about the text based installer on the alternate cds?
2008-02-18T02:34:00.000Z	nucco	onesandzeros	the text-based installer doesn't do magic :) you still have to formt your root and boot partitions.
2008-02-18T02:35:00.000Z	onesandzeros	nucco	honestly, it doesn't seem like magic to me.  ubuntu is debian based isn't?  even the debian installer does it
2008-02-18T02:35:00.000Z	nucco	onesandzeros	debian installer allows install to an unclean boot partition?... hmmm
2008-02-18T02:37:00.000Z	onesandzeros	nucco	yes, it does.
2008-02-18T02:38:00.000Z	onesandzeros	nucco	archlinux does, and gentoo's text installer does
2008-02-18T02:38:00.000Z	onesandzeros	nucco	are you a dev?
2008-02-18T02:39:00.000Z	nucco	onesandzeros	nope
2008-02-18T02:39:00.000Z	nucco	onesandzeros	i know that redhat does that too, but i don't recall seeing debian or ubuntu do that.
2008-02-18T02:39:00.000Z	onesandzeros	nucco	deb definitely does.  I've done it 3 or 4 times today, heheh
