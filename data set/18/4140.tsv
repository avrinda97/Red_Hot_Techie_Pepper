2010-01-09T04:10:00.000Z	erUSUL	del_diablo	that reads use pulseaudio instead
2010-01-09T04:10:00.000Z	del_diablo	erUSUL	Why is ESD removed and replaced with Pulseaudio that got broken defaults?
2010-01-09T04:11:00.000Z	erUSUL	del_diablo	esd is even more broken
2010-01-09T04:11:00.000Z	del_diablo	erUSUL	Explain yoursefl about it?
2010-01-09T04:12:00.000Z	erUSUL	del_diablo	esd is obsolete the same way xmms1 is. it is not developed anymore nobody uses it. you either use pulseaudio or plain alsa this days
2010-01-09T04:13:00.000Z	del_diablo	erUSUL	Wikipedia claims ESD is GNOME only, what did KDE use?
2010-01-09T04:13:00.000Z	erUSUL	del_diablo	artsd
2010-01-09T04:14:00.000Z	erUSUL	del_diablo	but all this is old history :)
2010-01-09T04:14:00.000Z	del_diablo	erUSUL	No really, tell me, enlighten me beyond what is not told.
2010-01-09T04:30:00.000Z	del_diablo	erUSUL	Why does not ship with barebone alsa instead of alsapulse?
2010-01-09T04:31:00.000Z	erUSUL	del_diablo	what; ubuntu? pulseaudio is considered the way fordward just like ext4 or other technologies
2010-01-09T04:31:00.000Z	del_diablo	erUSUL	Ext4 was at the least stable, in stark contrast.
2010-01-09T04:31:00.000Z	erUSUL	del_diablo	you are free to disagree though.
2010-01-09T04:32:00.000Z	erUSUL	del_diablo	pulseaudio has worked for me great even when it was not called pulseudio ; so my experience is great with it. but you know anecdotal evidence (your or mine) in not evidence at all. PA works for a lot of people
2010-01-09T04:33:00.000Z	del_diablo	erUSUL	Pulse works on my rig, but I notice that a lot of people had some sort of problems with it. I really wanted to see if somebody actually knew shit, and why pulse got into the system in the first place.
