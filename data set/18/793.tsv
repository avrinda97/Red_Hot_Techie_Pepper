2011-09-08T09:51:00.000Z	aple		How do I add something to my terminal? Like if I wanted to call /home/aple/MyApp from terminal like: "myapp newfile.txt". How would I do that?
2011-09-08T09:52:00.000Z	aple		I'm creating a symlink to it, but I'm not sure how to make it part of my terminal path
2011-09-08T09:52:00.000Z	mat619	aple	add /home/aple/bin or wherever you keep your app to your path variable
2011-09-08T09:53:00.000Z	mat619	aple	then when you call "myapp newfile.txt" the shell will look for an app by the name of myapp in all folders in $PATH, including the folder your app is actually in.
2011-09-08T09:54:00.000Z	aple	mat619	Last time I did this, I was told to make a symlink. Is that not necessary?
2011-09-08T09:54:00.000Z	mat619	aple	where is your app located and were you told to symlink it to?
2011-09-08T09:56:00.000Z	aple	mat619	Well, I don't care about symlinking to be honest. I just want to add Sublime Text 2 to terminal so I can call it from terminal like: "st2 newfile.txt" or just open it with "st2"
2011-09-08T09:57:00.000Z	aple	mat619	/home/aple/SublimeText2/sublime_text
2011-09-08T09:58:00.000Z	mat619	aple	ah, now I see why you were told to create a symlink. If the executable file itself is called "sublime_text", and you want to call it with "st2", you need to create a symlink on sublime_text called st2. that would be step 1.
2011-09-08T09:58:00.000Z	aple		How do I name symlinks?
2011-09-08T09:59:00.000Z	mat619	aple	second step would be to add /home/aple/SublimeText2/ to your path variable, so that the shell will search that folder for an app called "st2" when you call it.
2011-09-08T09:59:00.000Z	aple	mat619	Last time I did it, I did it in a one-liner.
2011-09-08T09:59:00.000Z	mat619	aple	ooff... good question. been a while since i last did that, something along the lines of "ln -s sublime_text st2" when you're in /home/aple/SublimeText2/.
2011-09-08T10:00:00.000Z	mat619	aple	am unsure of the exact syntax though, you might want to look it up if it doesn't work.
2011-09-08T10:04:00.000Z	mat619	aple	check this for an explanation about how to set the PATH-variable to include /home/aple/SublimeText2/ - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/EnvironmentVariables
2011-09-08T10:06:00.000Z	mat619		How can I check if a package is available in the repos of a now unsupported release? packages.ubuntu.com doesn't allow me to search old repos as far as I can see
2011-09-08T10:06:00.000Z	mat619		whereas "search" means "hack something into a search box and press enter", not navigate through a folder structure frontend
2011-09-08T10:10:00.000Z	aple	mat619	ln -s .... didn't work and the doc doesn't say anything
