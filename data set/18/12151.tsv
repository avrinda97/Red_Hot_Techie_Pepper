2006-07-19T12:22:00.000Z	ernz		Enniebuddee?

2006-07-19T12:24:00.000Z	ernz		Oh, OK.
2006-07-19T12:25:00.000Z	ernz		Anyone able to assist a semi-noob with a couple of issues?
2006-07-19T12:25:00.000Z	ernz		Righto, here it goes.
2006-07-19T12:27:00.000Z	ernz		My dad currently runs Windows. He has 2 physical HD's, an 80GB and a 120GB. Windows is on hda, hdb has backed up files on it. I booted using a genuine Ubuntu Dapper Drake 6.06 LTS disk, and tried to install as Dual Boot.
2006-07-19T12:28:00.000Z	richiefrich	ernz	ok go on
2006-07-19T12:28:00.000Z	richiefrich	ernz	it wont bootl windows ? right
2006-07-19T12:29:00.000Z	richiefrich		or
2006-07-19T12:29:00.000Z	richiefrich		sude -Hs
2006-07-19T12:29:00.000Z	ernz		hdb has 80+GB free, so I just partitioned manually, and used the remaining free space to create a swap (700MB) and a ext "/" partition of the remaining space. All seemed OK, we his apply and it came to an error message part way through and said creation failed.
2006-07-19T12:29:00.000Z	richiefrich		naw i have a root term open all the time
2006-07-19T12:30:00.000Z	ernz		Now the drive has 3 paritions on it, all apparently "Unformatted" and I can't mount any of them using the Live disk to retreive the info.
2006-07-19T12:31:00.000Z	ernz		Was that question to me WF?
2006-07-19T12:31:00.000Z	ernz	richiefrich	sorry, yes it does still boot windows from the C:\ (hda) drive
2006-07-19T12:32:00.000Z	richiefrich	ernz	so u mean  that the liveCD/installer failed?
2006-07-19T12:33:00.000Z	ernz	richiefrich	The partitioning section of the install failed in the LiveCD mode, and aborted the partition prematurely.
