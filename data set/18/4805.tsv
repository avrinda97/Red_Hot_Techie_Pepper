2009-02-07T00:00:00.000Z	blizzle	^hashbang^	Nah, I upgraded from Intrepid, otherwise I would have tried ext4.
2009-02-07T00:00:00.000Z	^hashbang^	blizzle	how did you upgrade?
2009-02-07T00:01:00.000Z	blizzle	^hashbang^	sudo update-manager -d ;)
2009-02-07T00:01:00.000Z	^hashbang^	blizzle	hmm, how does that point to 9.04 release?

2009-02-10T01:44:00.000Z	^hashbang^	blizzle	install ubuntu from a cdrom without a keyboard or monitor
2009-02-10T01:45:00.000Z	blizzle	^hashbang^	Ah. Now that's going to prove a little tricky :)
2009-02-10T01:46:00.000Z	blizzle	^hashbang^	If you can remove the hd and place in another system, you might be able to install Ubuntu ok.
2009-02-10T01:46:00.000Z	^hashbang^	blizzle	true... then put that drive back into the server =)
2009-02-10T01:47:00.000Z	^hashbang^	blizzle	more work than it's worth I think .... much eaiser to put a monitor and keyboard on the server lol
2009-02-10T01:47:00.000Z	blizzle	^hashbang^	Your call :)
