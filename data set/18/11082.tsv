2011-07-30T23:44:00.000Z	_trine		guys I am in trouble
2011-07-30T23:45:00.000Z	_trine		I have completely messed up my xorg in 11.04
2011-07-30T23:45:00.000Z	_trine		how can I recover
2011-07-30T23:45:00.000Z	ikonia	_trine	just remove your xorg.conf file and it will go back to auto detection
2011-07-30T23:46:00.000Z	_trine	ikonia	is that in X11
2011-07-30T23:46:00.000Z	ikonia	_trine	/etc/X11
2011-07-30T23:46:00.000Z	ikonia	_trine	although how did you mess it up if you don't know where the config file is ?
2011-07-30T23:46:00.000Z	ikonia	_trine	how ?
2011-07-30T23:47:00.000Z	ikonia	_trine	put them back
2011-07-30T23:48:00.000Z	ikonia	_trine	how did you install an nvidia driver
2011-07-30T23:50:00.000Z	_trine	ikonia	would you mind if I spoke in pm as it gets me mixed up here
2011-07-30T23:50:00.000Z	ikonia	_trine	I'd rather speak in here
2011-07-30T23:51:00.000Z	_trine	ikonia	I have got to a prompt
2011-07-30T23:53:00.000Z	_trine	ikonia	I can see xorg.conf.failsafe do  need to use that
2011-07-30T23:54:00.000Z	_trine	ikonia	there is no file just called xorg.conf
2011-07-30T23:54:00.000Z	ikonia	_trine	I suggest you ask the channel, not me
2011-07-31T00:17:00.000Z	_trine	ikonia	do you think you could suggest someone who may be able to help when they come on channel I really need this computer working for this coming week as it has all my letters on it
