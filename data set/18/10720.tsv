2008-04-04T07:47:00.000Z	srbaker		hey folks
2008-04-04T07:47:00.000Z	srbaker		is there a list of hardware companies that offer machines pre-installed with ubuntu that i can see?
2008-04-04T07:48:00.000Z	srbaker		does dell offer every machine with ubuntu, or just one or two?
2008-04-04T07:48:00.000Z	srbaker		i want a fast as hell machine
2008-04-04T07:48:00.000Z	srbaker		suck
2008-04-04T07:49:00.000Z	troxor	srbaker	they only offer pre-installed ubuntu on several machines, afaict
2008-04-04T07:50:00.000Z	troxor	srbaker	which doesn't necessarily mean ubuntu won't run on other models
2008-04-04T07:50:00.000Z	srbaker	troxor	i want to order a machine that i can sit down and start using
2008-04-04T07:51:00.000Z	srbaker	troxor	i was a linux user for 10 years, and bought a mac.  i have no interest in installing operating systems, twiddling bits, or touching hardware ever again :)
2008-04-04T07:52:00.000Z	troxor	srbaker	your best bet is to check out what's available then ;)
2008-04-04T07:52:00.000Z	srbaker	troxor	only the inspiron 530
2008-04-04T07:52:00.000Z	srbaker	troxor	i wanted an XPS :(
2008-04-04T07:53:00.000Z	troxor	srbaker	both dell and system76 are good
2008-04-04T07:55:00.000Z	srbaker	troxor	the inspiron 530 can be tricked out pretty nicely, but not quite what i want, unfortunately
2008-04-04T07:55:00.000Z	troxor	srbaker	there are a few machines that come with redhat enterprise, iirc
2008-04-04T07:56:00.000Z	troxor	srbaker	and if RH will run on them, ubuntu will :)
2008-04-04T07:57:00.000Z	srbaker	troxor	ah, true.
2008-04-04T07:57:00.000Z	srbaker	troxor	i think i might just get system76 so i can not install myself :P
