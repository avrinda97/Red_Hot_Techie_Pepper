2011-07-20T22:32:00.000Z	Snarsh		using wordpress on a lamp i set up, when i go to the wordpress link in my address bar it attempts to download the .phtml file instead of showing the page, i added the type to the apache2.conf file so that it would run php but still no luck, restarted apache2 as well
2011-07-20T22:33:00.000Z	Snarsh		i did sudo ae2mod php5 and it says the module is already installed
2011-07-20T22:34:00.000Z	aetas	Snarsh	how do you have PHP bound to accept those types?
2011-07-20T22:36:00.000Z	aetas	Snarsh	so you mean its a default apache2 / php install?  nothing special?
2011-07-20T22:37:00.000Z	aetas	Snarsh	libapache2-mod-php5?
2011-07-20T22:38:00.000Z	aetas	Snarsh	ok.  can you go into your config and find the section for php and msg me what you have?
2011-07-20T22:38:00.000Z	Snarsh	aetas	which directory/file? if you are talking about apache2.conf there is no php in the file
2011-07-20T22:39:00.000Z	aetas	Snarsh	if you are using the default file then it should actually be in /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/php5.conf
2011-07-20T22:40:00.000Z	aetas	Snarsh	when you get it make sure you post it in a msg or pastebin it
2011-07-20T22:42:00.000Z	aetas	Snarsh	ok.  do you have it still set to host from /var/www/html or did you change that already?
2011-07-20T22:43:00.000Z	Snarsh	aetas	is that setting in apache2.conf? i just added UserDir disabled root; UserDir public_html to the conf and have the worpdress php files in public_html in my home folder
2011-07-20T22:44:00.000Z	aetas	Snarsh	ok, then your problem is somewhere in there.  we'll have to work with that
2011-07-20T22:45:00.000Z	aetas	Snarsh	do "ls -l" on your public_html dir and tell me what the permissions, owner and such are set on it as well as your php file
2011-07-20T22:46:00.000Z	aetas	Snarsh	actually I dunno why I didnt see this earlier.  your php config file has userdir disabled for php files
2011-07-20T22:46:00.000Z	aetas	Snarsh	disable the IfModule userdir block
2011-07-20T22:49:00.000Z	aetas	Snarsh	yeah, its bad since it gives everyone on the system php access
2011-07-20T22:49:00.000Z	aetas	Snarsh	(with the default config anyway)
2011-07-20T22:51:00.000Z	aetas	Snarsh	most welcome
