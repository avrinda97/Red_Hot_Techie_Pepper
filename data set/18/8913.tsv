2008-04-29T08:43:00.000Z	Fezzler		Hardy install created new /home/me on sd0 when I had all users on second HD sd1 and sd1 mounted as /home.  All users screwed up.  Fix?
2008-04-29T08:44:00.000Z	Fezzler		So I had Ubuntu set up so OS was on my first HD and second HD was my user /homes
2008-04-29T08:44:00.000Z	Fezzler		Now the second HD shows up as "200.00 GB Media" in Places
2008-04-29T08:45:00.000Z	cabrioleur	Fezzler	you can alter your /etc/fstab file to mount 2nd hdd in /home
2008-04-29T08:53:00.000Z	cabrioleur	Fezzler	for instance "/dev/sdb1  /mnt  ext3  defaults   1   2", where your /dev/sdb1 is your partition on 2nd hdd
2008-04-29T08:56:00.000Z	cabrioleur	Fezzler	sorry for a mistake, "/dev/sdb1 /home ext3 defaults 1 2"
2008-04-29T08:59:00.000Z	cabrioleur	Fezzler	is it your existing writeup in fstab?
2008-04-29T09:02:00.000Z	cabrioleur	Fezzler	if it was in your /etc/fstab, then your /home partition is mounted by the second hard drive already.
2008-04-29T09:02:00.000Z	cabrioleur	Fezzler	you can check it with command "mount"
2008-04-29T09:02:00.000Z	cabrioleur	Fezzler	drop your fstab to pastebin
2008-04-29T09:09:00.000Z	cabrioleur	Fezzler	you have to tell me exactly what's your partition with old users files.
2008-04-29T09:11:00.000Z	cabrioleur	Fezzler	type "mount" and see what device (it starts at "/dev/") is mounted to /media/disk
2008-04-29T09:13:00.000Z	cabrioleur	Fezzler	remove second to last line (the one that starts /dev/hda1) in your fstab
2008-04-29T09:14:00.000Z	cabrioleur	Fezzler	then type "sudo mount /dev/sdb1"
2008-04-29T09:20:00.000Z	cabrioleur	Fezzler	you do that by restarting computer. Yes, it's a good idea.
2008-04-29T09:26:00.000Z	cabrioleur	Fezzler	sort of. If you are logged in as user, you will pay consequences. Unmount your 2nd hard drive first, log out. Then by pressing alt+ctrl+f1 swhich to login screen.
2008-04-29T09:26:00.000Z	cabrioleur	Fezzler	log in up there, and type "sudo mount /dev/sdb1"
2008-04-29T09:30:00.000Z	cabrioleur	Fezzler	yes, change /dev/hdb1 to /dev/sdb1, and "nodev,nosuid" to "defaults"
