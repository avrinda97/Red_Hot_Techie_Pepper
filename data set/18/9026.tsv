2007-05-25T15:09:00.000Z	GomoX		it was httpD.conf
2007-05-25T15:10:00.000Z	GomoX		and in apache2 under debian/ubuntu, it's called apache2.conf
2007-05-25T15:11:00.000Z	GomoX		without purging the conf file
2007-05-25T15:12:00.000Z	GomoX		then just in case delete /etc/apache2 if it's still there
2007-05-25T15:12:00.000Z	GomoX		then install
2007-05-25T15:12:00.000Z	GomoX		voila
2007-05-25T15:12:00.000Z	hajhouse	GomoX	i actually thought i deinstalled it with aptitude purge
2007-05-25T15:08:00.000Z	GomoX	hajhouse	huh?
2007-05-25T15:09:00.000Z	GomoX	hajhouse	there was never an http.conf file
2007-05-25T15:11:00.000Z	hajhouse	GomoX	sorry, mistyping. The exact error i got after installing the apache2 package was apache2: Syntax error on line 189 of /etc/apache2/apache2.conf: Could not open configuration file /etc/apache2/httpd.conf: No such file or directory
2007-05-25T15:11:00.000Z	GomoX	hajhouse	i am guessing the problem is that you had apache2 installed at some point and you reinstalled it
2007-05-25T15:11:00.000Z	hajhouse	GomoX	correct!
2007-05-25T15:12:00.000Z	GomoX	hajhouse	ok, so apt-get remove --purge apache2
2007-05-25T15:12:00.000Z	GomoX	hajhouse	looks like you didn't
2007-05-25T15:12:00.000Z	hajhouse	GomoX	it apt-get remove --purge or dpkg --purge different from aptitude purge?
2007-05-25T15:13:00.000Z	GomoX	hajhouse	shouldn't be different
2007-05-25T15:14:00.000Z	GomoX	hajhouse	well looks like its a real bug then
2007-05-25T15:15:00.000Z	hajhouse	GomoX	roryy: thanks for the help
