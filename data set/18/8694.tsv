2007-12-31T21:34:00.000Z	gmu_ninja		help please!  Aptitude wants to remove all my packages!
2007-12-31T21:34:00.000Z	gmu_ninja		i don't know...
2007-12-31T21:36:00.000Z	gmu_ninja		i was adding sendmail... and it said it was going to remove about 400MB of packages because they are not needed any more
2007-12-31T21:36:00.000Z	gmu_ninja		the list of packages to remove includes apache2, etc.
2007-12-31T21:37:00.000Z	gmu_ninja		I do not currently have any MTA installed, and would sendmail cause apache2 to be removed?
2007-12-31T21:39:00.000Z	gmu_ninja		bust still... i can understand removing those two... but over 400MB of packages?
2007-12-31T21:39:00.000Z	gmu_ninja		including stuff like Apache?
2007-12-31T21:40:00.000Z	gmu_ninja		Aptitude want's to remove itself (package aptitude)
2007-12-31T21:41:00.000Z	Dr_willis	gmu_ninja	 you could try using synaptic, or from the shell try a 'sudo apt-get update' and 'sudo apt-get upgrade' see if that straightens things out
2007-12-31T21:43:00.000Z	Dr_willis	gmu_ninja	 Id do  a 'sudo apt-get update' and 'sudo apt-get upgrade' see if that straightens things out - ive had aptitude get very confused befor.  One way to find out. Ive had aptitude remove 200 packagges.. then reinstall them.. for some odd reason
2007-12-31T21:43:00.000Z	Dr_willis	gmu_ninja	 other then that.. not sure what to try.
2007-12-31T21:45:00.000Z	Dr_willis	gmu_ninja	 what was weird.. was the packages were allready downkloaded in the cache. so it dident really do much
2007-12-31T21:47:00.000Z	gmu_ninja	Dr_willis	what?  I did the apt-get update and upgrage, but it didn't modify the packages any... aptitude wants to remove 463MB of packages it thinks "are no longer used"
2007-12-31T21:48:00.000Z	Dr_willis	gmu_ninja	 yep - i had a similer issue. it removed 300 packages.. then it reinstalled them. Never did fiture out why/
2007-12-31T21:48:00.000Z	Dr_willis	gmu_ninja	,  so if you try to install ONE little package (say unp) it wants to remove a bunch every time eh?
2007-12-31T21:49:00.000Z	Dr_willis	gmu_ninja	 you may want to try apt-get installing somthing.  not using aptitude
2007-12-31T21:50:00.000Z	Dr_willis	gmu_ninja	 i alwyas use apt-get update, and apt-get upgrade.   never had the need for apttitude to do that.
