2009-09-19T03:59:00.000Z	h4mx0r		if I plugin another mouse I can left click otherwise I can only right click. Perhaps some special settings for the touchpad are going on?
2009-09-19T04:01:00.000Z	void_pointer	h4mx0r	try out crunchbang - an ubuntu derivative - on your netbook
2009-09-19T04:01:00.000Z	void_pointer	h4mx0r	works out of the box
2009-09-19T04:02:00.000Z	h4mx0r	void_pointer	yes I liked that one very much but if I could set it up to use the features of netbook ubuntu it would be so much easier to use
2009-09-19T04:02:00.000Z	h4mx0r	void_pointer	the full screen option and little sections for programs and documents are nice
2009-09-19T04:02:00.000Z	void_pointer	h4mx0r	yeah. I gave up. I feel the ubuntu netbook remix is inferior
2009-09-19T04:03:00.000Z	h4mx0r	void_pointer	did you have issues?
2009-09-19T04:03:00.000Z	h4mx0r	void_pointer	with the mouse?
2009-09-19T04:03:00.000Z	void_pointer	h4mx0r	yes, and touchpad
2009-09-19T04:03:00.000Z	void_pointer	h4mx0r	and function buttons like dim etc.
2009-09-19T04:03:00.000Z	h4mx0r	void_pointer	I noticed those buttons didn't work from start thanks for info
2009-09-19T04:04:00.000Z	void_pointer	h4mx0r	someone told me a fix for my mouse, but it didn't work. Maybe you'll have better luck
2009-09-19T04:05:00.000Z	h4mx0r	void_pointer	that's what I don't get I mean it was working perhaps I didn't reboot after update and it had broken
2009-09-19T04:05:00.000Z	void_pointer	h4mx0r	yes, mine was working too, and I never found out what made it stop lol
2009-09-19T04:05:00.000Z	void_pointer	h4mx0r	 you might be the dude to solve the mystery
2009-09-19T04:06:00.000Z	h4mx0r	void_pointer	I dunno but I was getting some weird acpid calls from root perhaps its a power save feature gone wrong killing it
2009-09-19T04:07:00.000Z	void_pointer	h4mx0r	yeah, I suspected the acpi - well I'm almost sure that's what it was. Reinstalling all the stuff I could find didn't help
2009-09-19T04:12:00.000Z	h4mx0r	void_pointer	I found this http://www.freesoftwaremagazine.com/columns/ubuntu_netbook_remix_detailed_explanation so gonna try doing an openbox similar to netbook distro of ubuntu
