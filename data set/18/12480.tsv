2006-06-10T07:53:00.000Z	neutrinomass	Hobbsee	Out of curiosity, why not pastebin.com ?
2006-06-10T07:54:00.000Z	Hobbsee	neutrinomass	i'm not sure...it seems that we actually own that domain or something
2006-06-10T07:55:00.000Z	neutrinomass	Hobbsee	Ok, thanks :)
2006-06-13T07:14:00.000Z	neutrinomass	Hobbsee	Thanks :)
2006-06-16T09:55:00.000Z	Hobbsee	neutrinomass	not really
2006-06-16T09:55:00.000Z	Hobbsee	neutrinomass	most of the time, the ban list doesnt get cleared
2006-06-16T09:56:00.000Z	neutrinomass	Hobbsee	Well, not unban people. But banning whomever tries that exploit ...
2006-06-16T09:56:00.000Z	Hobbsee	neutrinomass	it was tried, too many false positives
2006-06-16T09:56:00.000Z	neutrinomass	Hobbsee	that sucks :(
2006-06-17T08:25:00.000Z	Hobbsee	neutrinomass	?
2006-06-17T08:25:00.000Z	neutrinomass	Hobbsee	Frrderick can only be a bot :)
2006-09-03T05:38:00.000Z	neutrinomass	Hobbsee	Do you know anything about this problem? It's a "no gtk apps start on kubuntu, after upgrading from breezy" (or if they keep the /home around ) .... there are tens of scattered bug reports around launchpad about this but all have been ignored
2006-09-03T05:52:00.000Z	Hobbsee	neutrinomass	no, not really.  what happens if you try starting them again?  yeah, removing .gtkrc-2.0 would likely fix it, yes.
2006-09-03T05:54:00.000Z	neutrinomass	Hobbsee	They always faill. All gtk apps... can anything be even done about this? (honestly, there are at least 10-20 open bugs about this but there has been no response to them )
2006-09-03T05:54:00.000Z	Hobbsee	neutrinomass	only by getting that file to be removed on upgrade, i suspect.
2006-09-03T05:54:00.000Z	Hobbsee	neutrinomass	can you subscribe me to any of those bug reports that you see, please?
2006-09-03T05:55:00.000Z	neutrinomass	Hobbsee	Ok, will do. There are buried but I'll try to dig a few up
2006-09-03T05:56:00.000Z	Hobbsee	neutrinomass	cool
