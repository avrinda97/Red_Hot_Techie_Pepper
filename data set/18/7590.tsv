2010-01-13T04:50:00.000Z	imran	soreau	it found drivers on 9.04 so I know there are some, but i upgraded to 9.10 today and its not finding
2010-01-13T04:50:00.000Z	soreau	imran	You probably need to install the modalias package for the nvidia driver so it will appear in the jockey driver applet
2010-01-13T04:51:00.000Z	soreau	imran	Consider the output of 'apt-cache search modalias|grep nvidia'
2010-01-13T04:52:00.000Z	soreau	imran	I mean run the following in your terminal for an idea of what package to install 'apt-cache search modalias|grep nvidia'
2010-01-13T04:52:00.000Z	imran	soreau	trying it
2010-01-13T04:52:00.000Z	soreau	imran	You probably want one from the 18x.xx family, then check hardware drivers again
2010-01-13T04:53:00.000Z	imran	soreau	any way to be sure? There are 2 18X's. a 185 and a 180
2010-01-13T04:54:00.000Z	soreau	imran	Install both of the modalias packages, then look in the hardware drivers app to see if anything shows up
2010-01-13T04:54:00.000Z	imran	soreau	hold on Update Manager popped up, Im gonna let it update and see if it works
2010-01-13T04:54:00.000Z	imran	soreau	if not I will do those packages
2010-01-13T05:54:00.000Z	soreau	imran	So you figured out how to get your drivers working?
2010-01-13T05:56:00.000Z	imran	soreau	yes, I just updated from update manager and its working fine now
2010-01-13T05:56:00.000Z	soreau	imran	To know how to use the cube, type this here or come to #compiz:  /msg FusioBot cube
