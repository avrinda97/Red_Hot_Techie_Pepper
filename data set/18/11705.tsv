2006-09-23T12:40:00.000Z	ashzilla		When I open any video file with any player everything is washed out and the video is unbearable to watch
2006-09-23T12:42:00.000Z	ashzilla		Can someone help with my video....
2006-09-23T12:43:00.000Z	ashzilla		I cannot watch DVDs, they are washed out and whenever light is involved it becomes completely white
2006-09-23T12:43:00.000Z	krazykit	ashzilla	you have an intel card, right?
2006-09-23T12:44:00.000Z	krazykit	ashzilla	assuming you have an intel graphics chip, this is a known bug
2006-09-23T12:44:00.000Z	ashzilla	krazykit	yes
2006-09-23T12:44:00.000Z	ashzilla	krazykit	how do I fix it? It's every player I use...
2006-09-23T12:44:00.000Z	krazykit	ashzilla	yeah, known bug.  no good fix.
2006-09-23T12:45:00.000Z	krazykit	ashzilla	actually, no, there is a fix
2006-09-23T12:45:00.000Z	krazykit	ashzilla	don't use xv overlay for your video driver.  try the gl or gl2 drivers.  if those don't work, x11 might.
2006-09-23T12:45:00.000Z	ashzilla	krazykit	how do I use the gl drivers
2006-09-23T12:45:00.000Z	krazykit	ashzilla	using totem?  no idea.  i only use mplayer
2006-09-23T12:46:00.000Z	krazykit	ashzilla	i know.  mplayer -vo gl will do it

2006-09-23T12:47:00.000Z	krazykit	ashzilla	just let it be known that bigger resolutions might cause issues if you have a slower processor.  it should be fixed in edgy
2006-09-23T12:48:00.000Z	ashzilla	krazykit	is edgy the next release of Ubuntu?
2006-09-23T12:48:00.000Z	krazykit	ashzilla	yeah.
2006-09-23T12:49:00.000Z	ashzilla	krazykit	how do I fast forward while using the terminal to start with those options?
