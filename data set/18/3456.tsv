2009-10-02T05:48:00.000Z	ricky21tom	bobertdos	hey what is that
2009-10-02T05:49:00.000Z	bobertdos	ricky21tom	 It's a repository containing very restricted software. One of the things it contains is a package with the windows media codecs in it.
2009-10-02T05:51:00.000Z	bobertdos	ricky21tom	Anyway, turning my attention now to partimage........
2009-10-02T05:53:00.000Z	bobertdos	ricky21tom	Like Scott said before, it's not for making DVD's, but rather for creating hard drive images and transferring them to a medium in archived format. It wouldn't be bootable of course, but you could make a drive image, burn it or save it to a flash drive and then restore it with partimage.
2009-10-02T05:55:00.000Z	ricky21tom	bobertdos	not an issue with that just teach me how to use it

2009-10-02T05:58:00.000Z	bobertdos	ricky21tom	 It's a commandline utility, so it must be run from the terminal. Basically, you can choose to create your archive using tar gzip files or bz2 if you want them to be more compressed. To specify where you want an image saved, you have to type in the full Unix path to the archive you want to make. Otherwise, you can just specify a file name, and it will save to the current working directory of the terminal.
2009-10-02T05:59:00.000Z	ricky21tom	bobertdos	hey â€Žit is very complicated
