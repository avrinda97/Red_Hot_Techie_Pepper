2007-08-21T16:30:00.000Z	dooglus	ProphetPX	ubuntu and debian are very similar.  the debian community is larger, so bug reports get more attention.  it's a more sophisticated bunch, too - the IRC channel is more helpful than this one for non-trivial problems
2007-08-21T16:37:00.000Z	dooglus	ProphetPX	ubuntu is basically a copy of debian unstable, with minor alterations.
2007-08-21T16:37:00.000Z	ProphetPX	dooglus	 that's what i was thinking.
2007-08-21T16:38:00.000Z	ProphetPX	dooglus	 except to say that ubuntu is like debian unstable with mods, is like saying that ubuntu "stable" is unstable debian   lol
2007-08-21T16:38:00.000Z	dooglus	ProphetPX	the vast majority of development work happens 'upstream' - before debian get their hands on it, let alone ubuntu
2007-08-21T16:38:00.000Z	dooglus	ProphetPX	ubuntu takes a snapshot of debian every 6 months, then polishes it
2007-08-21T16:38:00.000Z	ProphetPX	dooglus	yeah
2007-08-21T16:48:00.000Z	dooglus	ProphetPX	imagine two 2gb swaps side by side
