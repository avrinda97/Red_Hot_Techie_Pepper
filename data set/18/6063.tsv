2008-11-01T20:56:00.000Z	n8tuser		Azhi_Dahaka-> use tar to archive it
2008-11-01T20:56:00.000Z	n8tuser		spazm->  great idea, but it backfired eh..hehehe
2008-11-01T20:57:00.000Z	n8tuser		spazm-> we all learn something new daily.. :)
2008-11-01T20:59:00.000Z	n8tuser		Azhi_Dahaka-> do something like   tar cf - /dir | 7z a -si dir.tar.7z  to back up /home
2008-11-01T21:01:00.000Z	n8tuser		Azhi_Dahaka-> then you can move the backup to the separate partition, come on man ..swing along with me... :P

2008-11-01T21:02:00.000Z	n8tuser		R0b0t1-> i'd do a fresh install it was me
2008-11-01T21:03:00.000Z	R0b0t1	n8tuser	Heh, it wouldn't do anything for me. I'd just copy my ~ directory anyway... :P
2008-12-14T22:16:00.000Z	R0b0t1	n8tuser	Sorry, I've used that command, "No option --disable-columns"
2008-12-14T22:17:00.000Z	R0b0t1	n8tuser	aptitude --disable-columns --display-format '%p' search '?installed!?automatic' > ~/installed_packages
2008-12-14T22:18:00.000Z	R0b0t1	n8tuser	I followed the suggestions....?
2008-12-14T22:18:00.000Z	R0b0t1	n8tuser	I copied it as I saw it, and it did not work.
2008-12-14T22:19:00.000Z	R0b0t1	n8tuser	sid@LinMac:~$ aptitude --disable-columns --display-format '%p' search '?installed!?automatic' > ~/installed_packages
2008-12-14T22:45:00.000Z	R0b0t1	n8tuser	Then how would I find the device name of the drive? I know where it is mounted, /media/SMALL, but I don't know it's drive name.
2009-01-17T05:37:00.000Z	n8tuser	R0b0t1	-> adjust your menu.lst  for whatever the default you wanted
2009-01-17T05:38:00.000Z	R0b0t1	n8tuser	is there a way to completely remove it?
2009-01-17T05:39:00.000Z	n8tuser	R0b0t1	-> easily, refer to your menu.lst of where this kernel and initrd resides, the unreference them and delete afterwards
