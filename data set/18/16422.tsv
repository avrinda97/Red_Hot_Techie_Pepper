2008-01-06T02:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	quinton_	 uncompress the source file, be sure you have all needed stuff installed (install build-essential package)  cd to the source dir, then normally its a ' ./configure then make, then sudo make install' commands.
2008-01-06T02:54:00.000Z	quinton_	dr_willis	would you please step by step guide me?
2008-01-06T02:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	quinton_	 step 1 uncompress the source archive.
2008-01-06T02:54:00.000Z	quinton_	dr_willis	yes, ok i uncompressed it to desktop
2008-01-06T02:56:00.000Z	quinton_	dr_willis	it uncompressed an actual folder and it says the same name w/o the .tar.bz2 on the end.
2008-01-06T02:58:00.000Z	quinton_	dr_willis	please continue.
2008-01-06T03:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	quinton_	 cd to the source dir that it made.. and read the install docs. The standard procedure is './configure' 'make' then 'sudo make install'
2008-01-06T03:02:00.000Z	quinton_	dr_willis	I dont quiet understand, Im not used to a terminal still (being a user coming from windows) if you wouldnt mind to download this file and tell me exactly so I do not mess up please?

2008-01-06T03:04:00.000Z	quinton_	dr_willis	http://pastebin.ca/843104
2008-01-06T03:04:00.000Z	quinton_	dr_willis	if that may help then theres the instructions.
2008-01-06T03:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	quinton_	 those docs seem rather clear and detailed. There a specific part you are not understanding?
2008-01-06T03:08:00.000Z	quinton_	dr_willis	I am just not good at understanding directions, I sorry for so much trouble.
2008-01-06T03:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	quinton_	 open up a  shell. cd to the dir the source is in,  the commands are './configure' then 'make ' then 'sudo make install'
2008-01-06T03:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	quinton_	 unless your system has some of the specific cases/issues those readmens mention.
2008-01-06T03:10:00.000Z	quinton_	dr_willis	what do you mean to open a shell. dir?
2008-01-06T03:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	quinton_	 if you dont understand the basics of the linux terminal. Its time to read some of the bash/shell/terminal starter guides.
