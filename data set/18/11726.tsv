2006-06-23T08:09:00.000Z	soundray	rahul84	there are lots of gentle introductions on the web - have you searched?
2006-06-23T08:10:00.000Z	rahul84	soundray	yes..but i am not getting the correct result
2006-06-23T08:10:00.000Z	rahul84	soundray	log shows erro 0*0001
2006-06-23T08:11:00.000Z	soundray	rahul84	can you paste your crontab on http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org
2006-06-23T08:15:00.000Z	rahul84	soundray	i have posted it..
2006-06-23T08:16:00.000Z	soundray	rahul84	you need to fill in the username field before /bin/yasuc
2006-06-23T08:17:00.000Z	rahul84	soundray	even then its not working..
2006-06-23T08:18:00.000Z	soundray	rahul84	did you run crontab -e to make that entry?
2006-06-23T08:20:00.000Z	rahul84	soundray	i did run crontab -e in root
2006-06-23T08:21:00.000Z	soundray	rahul84	can you not run 'while true ; do /bin/yasuc ; sleep 300 ; done'?
2006-06-23T08:22:00.000Z	rahul84	soundray	were should i write that command to?
2006-06-23T08:22:00.000Z	soundray	rahul84	in a terminal (Alt-F2, enter 'gnome-terminal')
2006-06-23T08:23:00.000Z	soundray	rahul84	btw, are you sure that your program is located in /bin/ ?
2006-06-23T08:30:00.000Z	rahul84	soundray	yes the program is located in /bin
2006-06-23T08:30:00.000Z	rahul84	soundray	after i execute the crontab -e, i wrote it to /etc/crontab...is it right?
2006-06-23T08:31:00.000Z	soundray	rahul84	no... cron should load the crontab automatically once you save and exit
2006-06-23T08:33:00.000Z	rahul84	soundray	so how do i actually run crontab?
