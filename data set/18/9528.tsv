2008-07-15T19:27:00.000Z	red22		how can i make "ls" sort files/directories in the same order as windows?  specifically, i want names that start with "_" to come before any alphabet letters.  anyone know how pls?
2008-07-15T19:27:00.000Z	Slart	red22	there is a setting somewhere.. I've done it
2008-07-15T19:28:00.000Z	red22	Slart	remember even generally where this setting was?  it would save me a lot of time.  right now "_" is just ignored in the sorting process.
2008-07-15T19:29:00.000Z	Slart	red22	I'm googling =)... something like natural language sorting order.. might have been a setting in bash somewhere.. I'll get back to you when I find it
2008-07-15T19:30:00.000Z	red22	Slart	ok ty, i'll be searching too, but >30mins searching with now luck so far...
2008-07-15T19:38:00.000Z	Slart	red22	ok, found some info.. now to find out what I have changed on my system
2008-07-15T19:40:00.000Z	Slart	red22	here's some info http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=68462
2008-07-15T19:43:00.000Z	red22	Slart	thanks, i'm gonna try that and see if it works.  tell ya in 3 mins.
2008-07-15T20:01:00.000Z	red22	Slart	well that deals with the order of aphabetic character (thanks, a step forward) but it's still ignoring "_"... that is "a" is sorted BEFORE "_C" but i would like "_C" to be first.  know what i mean?
2008-07-15T20:01:00.000Z	Slart	red22	tried setting LC_COLLATE to posix?
2008-07-15T20:01:00.000Z	Slart	red22	you can test it out by doing "LC_COLLATE=posix ls"
2008-07-15T20:02:00.000Z	Slart	red22	that way you don't have to mess with config files until you know what you want
2008-07-15T20:05:00.000Z	red22	Slart	the way you posted doesn't work, something wrong about the syntax... pls fix
2008-07-15T20:06:00.000Z	red22	Slart	i'll brb afk 10 mins have to take care of something.  i'll read from here on.
2008-07-15T21:13:00.000Z	red22	Slart	you still around?
2008-07-15T21:44:00.000Z	Slart	red22	back again.. did you find anything? I've been googling but all I've found are the LC_COLLATE setting
2008-07-15T21:44:00.000Z	Slart	red22	also, using the -v switch for ls gives me some results..
2008-07-15T21:45:00.000Z	Slart	red22	but nothing that will place _file before Afile
