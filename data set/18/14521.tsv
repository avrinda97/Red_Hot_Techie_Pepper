2007-01-11T12:37:00.000Z	deus		What shall i do with unmet dependecies when dist-upgrading?
2007-01-11T12:38:00.000Z	Jowi	deus	first of all, are you running kubuntu or ubuntu?
2007-01-11T12:42:00.000Z	deus	Jowi	mooey how do i do that?
2007-01-11T12:44:00.000Z	Jowi	deus	do what?
2007-01-11T12:45:00.000Z	deus	Jowi	and im using kubuntu
2007-01-11T12:45:00.000Z	Jowi	deus	ok. and are you dist-upgrading in order to change ubuntu versions or is this a general dist-upgrade?
2007-01-11T12:47:00.000Z	deus	Jowi	im going from dapper to edgyt
2007-01-11T12:47:00.000Z	Jowi	deus	make sure you have kubuntu-desktop installed first of all.
2007-01-11T12:47:00.000Z	Jowi	deus	that should take care of most dependency problems
2007-01-11T12:48:00.000Z	deus	Jowi	well, i allready updatete to the edgy source list
2007-01-11T12:49:00.000Z	Jowi	deus	not sure if it is too late or not. which packages have problems?
2007-01-11T12:51:00.000Z	deus	Jowi	http://pastebin.ca/313306
2007-01-11T12:52:00.000Z	Jowi	deus	did you interrupt the dist-upgrade or did you continue to upgrade dispite the problems?
2007-01-11T12:55:00.000Z	Jowi	deus	before I give you advice I need to know if you already have started the upgrade or if you interrupted it when you saw there were problems?
2007-01-11T12:56:00.000Z	deus	Jowi	it never started
2007-01-11T12:57:00.000Z	Jowi	deus	then it is safe to switch back to the dapper repos. install kubuntu-desktop. then turn back to the edgy ones, apt-get update and dist-upgrade. if you still get errors. take a note which packages have conflics, and remove them. you can always re-install them after the upgrade has finished. was I clear or should i rephrase?
2007-01-11T12:59:00.000Z	Jowi	deus	also note which programs are dependent of those packages and remove them. install them after the upgrade has finished.
2007-01-11T12:59:00.000Z	Jowi	deus	now, I need to go. good luck
