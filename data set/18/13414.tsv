2006-08-03T06:53:00.000Z	sethk	Grisen	the BIOS selects the first drive, so grub has to be on the mbr of the first drive
2006-08-03T07:39:00.000Z	sethk	Grisen	there is a "terminal" program on the accessory menu
2006-08-03T07:40:00.000Z	sethk	Grisen	that works, I have one box I boot that way.
2006-08-03T07:40:00.000Z	sethk	Grisen	for gnome you want gnome-terminal
2006-08-03T07:40:00.000Z	sethk	Grisen	which is called "terminal" on the menu but the name of the program is gnome-terminal
2006-08-03T07:42:00.000Z	sethk	Grisen	I don't understand the question
2006-08-03T08:49:00.000Z	sethk	Grisen	fdformat /dev/fd0
2006-08-03T08:56:00.000Z	sethk	Grisen	you have to mount the floppy and copy the /boot directory to it
