2006-09-25T07:30:00.000Z	sethk	Phoul	yes, that could well be normal
2006-09-25T07:30:00.000Z	Phoul		Well im wondering if updating will fix it
2006-09-25T07:30:00.000Z	Phoul		err
2006-09-25T07:30:00.000Z	Phoul		fix == break
2006-09-25T07:30:00.000Z	Phoul		i dont wanna break my system
2006-09-25T07:30:00.000Z	sethk	Phoul	you don't?  :)
2006-09-25T07:30:00.000Z	Phoul		lol
2006-09-25T07:30:00.000Z	Phoul		Moreso now then usual
2006-09-25T07:31:00.000Z	sethk	Phoul	my rule is, don't upgrade just because an upgrade is available.  upgrade because you need to for some reason.
2006-09-25T07:31:00.000Z	Phoul	sethk	would it break something to upgrade just a single app?
2006-09-25T07:32:00.000Z	sethk	Phoul	ordinarily, no.  if you use synaptic, you'll see what will be updated due to dependencies before you pull the switch
