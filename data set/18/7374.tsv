2009-01-13T01:37:00.000Z	zenwryly		I just upgraded to intrepid and network-manager seems to ignore/miss DHCP success.  IOW, the logs show network manager initiating dhclient, they show dhclient succeeding, but then network manager doesn't notice the success and times out.  Can someone suggest what I might look into?
2009-01-13T01:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zenwryly	try renaming /etc/network/interfaces then rebooting
2009-01-13T01:38:00.000Z	zenwryly	ActionParsnip	thanks! will do
2009-01-13T02:14:00.000Z	zenwryly	ActionParsnip	moving /etc/network/interfaces didn't work
2009-01-13T02:14:00.000Z	zenwryly	ActionParsnip	network-manager is still ignoring dhcp
2009-01-13T02:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zenwryly	bah, try wifi-radar instead
2009-01-13T02:15:00.000Z	zenwryly	ActionParsnip	is there a way I can just manually get the interace activated so I can run dhcp by hand for now?
2009-01-13T02:15:00.000Z	zenwryly	ActionParsnip	I mean the wired iface
2009-01-13T02:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zenwryly	yeah, edit the interfaces file with gksudo gedit

2009-01-13T02:19:00.000Z	zenwryly	ActionParsnip	I still need it to use dhcp
2009-01-13T02:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zenwryly	you can specify it in that file
2010-10-03T04:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zenwryly	sudo update-grub
2010-10-03T04:31:00.000Z	zenwryly	ActionParsnip	I want it to happen automatically when apt is run the same way it does on my desktop ubuntu machines
2010-10-03T04:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zenwryly	sounds like a bug to me
2010-10-03T04:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zenwryly	with grub-pc   you could try reinstalling the package
2010-10-03T04:34:00.000Z	zenwryly	ActionParsnip	good idea, thanks
