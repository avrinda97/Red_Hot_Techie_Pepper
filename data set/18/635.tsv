2011-11-19T05:22:00.000Z	wolfman3k5		how am I supposed to start services in Ubuntu 11.10?
2011-11-19T05:22:00.000Z	slucidi	wolfman3k5	does 'sudo service <servicename> start' do the trick for you?
2011-11-19T05:24:00.000Z	slucidi	wolfman3k5	I don
2011-11-19T05:27:00.000Z	slucidi	wolfman3k5	I don't think you actually apt-get installed apache2... 'service apache2 start' works for me. can you show me a pastebin of its output?
2011-11-19T05:28:00.000Z	wolfman3k5	slucidi	I just rebuilt my distro on Linode, so it's a fresh install
2011-11-19T05:29:00.000Z	slucidi	wolfman3k5	then you'll need to 'sudo apt-get install apache2' if you want to run it from a fresh install. ;)
2011-11-19T05:29:00.000Z	wolfman3k5	slucidi	you're right, I just did a SSH restart
2011-11-19T05:29:00.000Z	wolfman3k5	slucidi	my bad
2011-11-19T05:30:00.000Z	wolfman3k5	slucidi	I won't install Apache 2 anymore. I will go NGINX this time
2011-11-19T05:30:00.000Z	wolfman3k5	slucidi	root@tek:~# service ssh restart
2011-11-19T05:30:00.000Z	wolfman3k5	slucidi	does that look familiar ?:)
2011-11-19T05:31:00.000Z	slucidi	wolfman3k5	hehe yep, your install is working fine, you just need to install the packages you want to use to run your webserver via apt ;)
2011-11-19T05:32:00.000Z	wolfman3k5	slucidi	I will go with NGINX - MYSQL - PFM-PHP and POSTFIX + DOVECOT for mail
2011-11-19T05:33:00.000Z	wolfman3k5	slucidi	I want to install Ubuntu on my desktop as well, but I got dual Radeon 6950 XFire cards, and I need to Kill X the first time it boots so that I can install AMD proprietary drivers. How do I do that? I haven't plaid with X in years, so my memory is kinda funny
2011-11-19T05:35:00.000Z	slucidi	wolfman3k5	you shouldn't need to outright kill xorg to install the drivers. but at any rate you can do ctrl-alt-f1 to get to a virtual terminal, log in, and then use kill to end the process. or just install the drivers from the command line that way
2011-11-19T05:36:00.000Z	wolfman3k5	slucidi	I need to because I got a CrossFire setup, so after a fresh install I get black screens on my dual monitor setups ... with blinking lights, which means that the monitors are not getting a signal
2011-11-19T05:39:00.000Z	wolfman3k5	slucidi	that's right
2011-11-19T05:42:00.000Z	slucidi	wolfman3k5	7's not so bad. it's a big improvement over Vista at least. and 8's shaping up to be even less resource heavy if the dev preview is any indication.
