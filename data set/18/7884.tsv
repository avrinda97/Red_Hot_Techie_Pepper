2007-12-29T22:50:00.000Z	Task		OK... I am reinstalling ubuntu... I got the 64x version,,, the newest one 7.10   and I hit install... it is staying still at a black screen with the last line that says  "*Running local boot scripts (ect/rc.local)" How long should it stay right here?

2007-12-29T22:52:00.000Z	nickrud	Task	is this the live cd?
2007-12-29T22:53:00.000Z	nickrud	Task	I hate to say this, but you should probably download the alternate cd and install from there. The live cd has issues on some machines
2007-12-29T22:54:00.000Z	nickrud	Task	I learned that lesson a few releases ago, but this time I stupidly got the live cd, and got lucky :)
2007-12-29T22:55:00.000Z	nickrud	Task	no, you shouldn't even see the rc.local stuff if the cd is booting into X correctly
2007-12-29T22:56:00.000Z	nickrud	Task	the stuff that follows, that's a trigger to give you some info
2007-12-30T00:39:00.000Z	nickrud	Task	they do mark the stuff as opened, just don't get anything with a broken seal
2007-12-30T00:45:00.000Z	nickrud	Task	http://www.linux-books.us/ubuntu_0002.php  don't know how good it is

2007-12-30T01:22:00.000Z	nickrud	Task	start by running    sudoedit /etc/X11/xorg  , find the line with "ati" , change to "fglrx"  and save, then sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart
2007-12-31T05:58:00.000Z	nickrud	Task	nah, it's my doppleganger tonight
2007-12-31T06:00:00.000Z	nickrud	Task	if I was to buy a video card, it would either be a cheap old nvidia, or the 8800. Not one of those half baked ones with the 128 bit channel instead of 320bit
2007-12-31T06:12:00.000Z	Task	nickrud	you said something about a 130 bit?
