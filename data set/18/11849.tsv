2007-12-22T14:18:00.000Z	itai	oldboy	thats very long, what are your spces?
2007-12-22T14:20:00.000Z	itai	oldboy	i mean cpu,memory
2007-12-22T14:21:00.000Z	itai	oldboy	i suspect something is wrong , is ubuntu fast after it boots?
2007-12-22T14:22:00.000Z	oldboy	itai	when ubuntu starts everything works perfect
2007-12-22T14:23:00.000Z	itai	oldboy	i have no idea about ubuntu ultimate, but what i would do is download BUM and start cancelling unnecessary stuff on boot. If you are more comfertable with Linux you can try running a programme called sysvconfig - but be very careful with it. ask here if you are not sure
