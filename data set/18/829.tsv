2011-11-05T04:41:00.000Z	chaos_		<chaospsychex>: have you listened to all the traffic to see if your dos'n yourself with a rougue procees or such
2011-11-05T04:43:00.000Z	chaos_		<chaospsychex>: distance matters too. i had a setup (wireless) where i was getting 30kbs and moved ten feet closer and got close to 1mb
2011-11-05T04:44:00.000Z	chaos_		<chaospsychex>: are you wireless?
2011-11-05T04:44:00.000Z	chaos_		is the client or server the one your on and complainging about?
2011-11-05T04:45:00.000Z	chaos_		well wireless technology can have issues such as same freq as a neighbor much people using the same freq
2011-11-05T04:46:00.000Z	chaos_		try changing the routers wireless channel to say 1,6 or 11
2011-11-05T04:48:00.000Z	chaos_		<chaospsychex>: you obviously have a bottleneck on you network. if your runnnig samba improperly misconfigured it can do that. you should monitor the local traffic with say wireshark and see where all this traffic is comming from. i mean you could be hacked and acting in a botnet and not know it..
2011-11-05T04:49:00.000Z	chaos_		avahi-daemon ->die.forever ? please
