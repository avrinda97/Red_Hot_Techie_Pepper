2010-03-09T21:03:00.000Z	dualbooter		I have a serious problem. My GRUB bootloader is corrupt and will not load ubuntu or windows. I would like to save my windows installation, as there is a lot of important data on it, so I'm trying to install Ubuntu on an area of free space on the hard disk but it is saying this space is "unusable" and wont let me install. Can anyone please help me?
