2007-08-01T15:33:00.000Z	neuber		Hey I can't get my terminal to work
2007-08-01T15:34:00.000Z	neuber		can someone tell my why I cant get a terminal to open?
2007-08-01T15:35:00.000Z	tupa	neuber	several answers come to my mind
2007-08-01T15:35:00.000Z	neuber	tupa	like what?
2007-08-01T15:35:00.000Z	tupa	neuber	are you running a Desktop Environment?
2007-08-01T15:36:00.000Z	neuber	tupa	uh... i think so?
2007-08-01T15:36:00.000Z	tupa	neuber	which one?
2007-08-01T15:36:00.000Z	neuber	tupa	i'm not really sure... i'm pretty new at this...
2007-08-01T15:37:00.000Z	tupa	neuber	did you installed, ubuntu, kubuntu or xubuntu
2007-08-01T15:37:00.000Z	neuber	tupa	ubuntu
2007-08-01T15:37:00.000Z	tupa	neuber	ALT+F2 -> gnome-terminal <enter>
2007-08-01T15:38:00.000Z	neuber	tupa	that doesn't seem to do anything
2007-08-01T15:38:00.000Z	neuber	tupa	i don't think i'm using gnome right now
2007-08-01T15:38:00.000Z	tupa	neuber	try xterm
2007-08-01T15:39:00.000Z	neuber	tupa	so why does that work, but the gui shortcut doesn't?
2007-08-01T15:40:00.000Z	tupa	neuber	I dunno, there can be several options, one is probably you removed gnome-terminal and that's why you couldn't run it with gnome-terminal command
2007-08-01T15:40:00.000Z	neuber	tupa	how could i accidentally remove something like that?
2007-08-01T15:41:00.000Z	tupa	neuber	I dunno
