2006-01-07T10:36:00.000Z	rohan		fluxbox is worse than xfce for you, Gecko
2006-01-07T10:36:00.000Z	rohan		try kde, but i am not really expecting it to be any faster, Gecko
2006-01-07T10:36:00.000Z	Gecko	rohan	well, at least it doens't remind me of cde ;)
2006-01-07T10:37:00.000Z	rohan	Gecko	tho' as kde uses preloading, apps will open faster.
2006-01-07T10:37:00.000Z	rohan	Gecko	cos even i use kde on my piii 550mhz XD
2006-01-07T10:37:00.000Z	Gecko	rohan	that's an excelent suggestion
2006-01-07T10:37:00.000Z	rohan	Gecko	i hope you are not being sarcastic :|
2006-01-07T10:37:00.000Z	Gecko	rohan	I am not :)
2006-01-07T10:37:00.000Z	rohan	Gecko	heh, ok. then go ahead, apt-get install kubuntu-desktop !!!
2006-01-07T10:38:00.000Z	rohan		install kde 3.5 tho' its better
2006-01-07T10:38:00.000Z	Gecko	rohan	I wasn't aware of the preloading, so it might just work
2006-01-07T10:38:00.000Z	Gecko	rohan	will I get the choice?
2006-01-07T10:38:00.000Z	rohan	Gecko	no. wait a mo'
2006-01-07T10:38:00.000Z	rohan	Gecko	see this, to get kde 3.5
2006-01-07T10:38:00.000Z	rohan		http://kubuntu.org/announcements/kde-35.php
2006-01-07T10:40:00.000Z	rohan	Gecko	basically, just, "echo deb http://kubuntu.org/packages/kde35 breezy main | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list"
