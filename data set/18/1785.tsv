2010-11-11T05:10:00.000Z	romann		hi, I'm having some freezing issues with ubuntu 10.10. I have 4 gigs of ram and i'm wondring if I need to setup a swap partition?
2010-11-11T05:10:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	romann	freezing like how?
2010-11-11T05:11:00.000Z	romann	aeon-ltd	it seems to happen while banshee is scanning my hd for music, but my mouse just starts studdering and not even moving at times. my num lock key will even lag
2010-11-11T05:12:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	romann	run banshee in a terminal to see if errors pop up, btw its good practice to have a swap anyway even if it isn't the root of this problem
2010-11-11T05:12:00.000Z	romann		ok, i'm sitting in gparted atm, and I'm wondering if there's anything specific I need to do with it. I have linux-swap selected and it's selected as a primary partition. is this correct?
2010-11-11T05:14:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	romann	iirc either is fine
2010-11-11T05:14:00.000Z	romann		alright, thank you for the help, aeon-ltd
2010-11-11T05:15:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	romann	btw in my experience if your going to be tinkering with the size, use a swap file instead
2010-11-11T05:15:00.000Z	romann		I have no idea what to do, but it just completed successfully heh
2010-11-11T05:15:00.000Z	romann		what that is*

2010-11-11T05:19:00.000Z	romann		errors from running banshee
2010-11-11T05:20:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	romann	thats when its freezing?
2010-11-11T05:20:00.000Z	romann		no it'll go on for a while, that's just from starting up
2010-11-11T05:20:00.000Z	romann		i can't really do anything once it starts freezing up, can't even launch xkill
2010-11-11T05:21:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	romann	whats it like when its freezing?
2010-11-11T05:22:00.000Z	romann	aeon-ltd	i can't really do anything. whatever program i have open freezes up, my mouse will respond seldom, and I can't open anything via alt+f2 or anything else
2010-11-11T05:23:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	romann	ok, a swap may fix that, though usually if you don;t have a swap it just dumps it and leaves it in the ram until its unloaded
