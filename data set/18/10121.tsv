2007-03-08T08:00:00.000Z	deltaray		Hi, I came to this channel because I'm trying to get Ubuntu on a machine that already has Vista on it.  I know how to install Ubuntu so I don't need help with that part, but....
2007-03-08T08:00:00.000Z	deltaray		the laptop with Vista already on it has a partition at the end of the drive that is 2GB and has what looks like a windows base partition on it (like a C: drive).
2007-03-08T08:00:00.000Z	deltaray		Its a Dell 640m if that helps.  Anyone know what this partition is?
2007-03-08T08:01:00.000Z	jimmygoon	deltaray	be careful - sometimes the 2gig is a recovery partition ESPECIALLY with Dells
2007-03-08T08:02:00.000Z	deltaray	jimmygoon	right, that's kinda what I figured, but I couldn't find anything to indicate that I could back that partition up to a dvd or something.
2007-03-08T08:02:00.000Z	jimmygoon	deltaray	: nah, that partition is like so you can hold down F8 when the PC starts up and the Dell thing runs to allow you to reapir your hard drive
2007-03-08T08:03:00.000Z	deltaray	jimmygoon	ok, so I could just reinstall Vista if it becomes a problem.
2007-03-08T08:03:00.000Z	jimmygoon	deltaray	 yes... that is what that partition is for.. which is why you should preserve it
2007-03-08T08:03:00.000Z	deltaray	jimmygoon	Actually, I heard something about needing to resize it from within Vista before installing Ubuntu , is that right?  Or can I just use gparted?
2007-03-08T08:04:00.000Z	jimmygoon	deltaray	if you are interested in trying to resize the vista partition.... (lemme find the link)
2007-03-08T08:04:00.000Z	jimmygoon	deltaray	ANY TIME YOU TRY TO RESIZE you SHOULDNOT be running any operating system off the hard drive
2007-03-08T08:04:00.000Z	deltaray	jimmygoon	ok, that makes sense.
2007-03-08T08:04:00.000Z	jimmygoon	deltaray	which is why you use a livecd... hold on
2007-03-08T08:06:00.000Z	jimmygoon	deltaray	thats really sad abotu synergy.. I love that app :)
2007-03-08T08:06:00.000Z	deltaray	jimmygoon	Yes, I've seen that before when I made a LiveDVD for my local LUG last year.
2007-03-08T08:07:00.000Z	deltaray	jimmygoon	 Oh well, they can dig themselves into a hole.  I've never seen so much interest in Linux as I have this year.
2007-03-08T08:07:00.000Z	jimmygoon	deltaray	 I've converted a few people already... they haven't looked back
2007-03-08T08:08:00.000Z	deltaray	jimmygoon	Did you read about that guy who installed Ubuntu for his dad, making his Dad think that he was installing Vista and his Dad liked it?   Let me see if I can find that.
