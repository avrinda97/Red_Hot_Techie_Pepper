2011-02-24T06:10:00.000Z	Chilaquiles	lillecarl	the problem is that sometimes I can't hybernate my laptop because it says that there's not enough memory
2011-02-24T06:10:00.000Z	lillecarl	Chilaquiles	how much swap space do you have?
2011-02-24T06:11:00.000Z	Chilaquiles	lillecarl	 1.5G in SWAP
2011-02-24T06:13:00.000Z	Chilaquiles	lillecarl	 why the heck I can't hybernate my computer because it says there's not enough memory! and I have 1.5G in swap
2011-02-24T06:14:00.000Z	lillecarl	Chilaquiles	prolyl because you got alot loaded in memory and swap, and when you hibernate i think everyting in your ram is saved in swap
2011-02-24T06:14:00.000Z	Chilaquiles	lillecarl	so how can I hybernate then?
2011-02-24T06:14:00.000Z	lillecarl	Chilaquiles	you could try to increase your swap using gparted
2011-02-24T06:15:00.000Z	Chilaquiles	lillecarl	but I thought you guys say that 1.5 is fine
2011-02-24T06:15:00.000Z	Chilaquiles	lillecarl	are you sure that's gonna solve the problem?
2011-02-24T06:17:00.000Z	lillecarl	Chilaquiles	its worth a try atleast or are you low on disk space?
2011-02-24T06:17:00.000Z	lillecarl	Chilaquiles	try this to
2011-02-24T06:18:00.000Z	lillecarl	Chilaquiles	run "top" in a commandline and see wich apps take most memory
2011-02-24T06:19:00.000Z	Chilaquiles	lillecarl	but as I said before, sometimes Im not running many programs (like 2) and it says that I don't have enough memory!!
2011-02-24T06:19:00.000Z	lillecarl	Chilaquiles	then you got stuff that should be in the swap in the memory
2011-02-24T06:20:00.000Z	Chilaquiles	lillecarl	ok so how you clear that?
2011-02-24T06:20:00.000Z	lillecarl	Chilaquiles	please talk in a private, easier
