2012-06-02T02:18:00.000Z	ikonia	Chrian	depends on the card

2012-06-02T02:23:00.000Z	ikonia	Chrian	I would not depend on wine
2012-06-02T02:23:00.000Z	ikonia	Chrian	if you need to run windows programs, use windows
2012-06-02T02:26:00.000Z	ikonia	Chrian	I would not consider wine for anything as a solution
