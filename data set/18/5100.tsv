2010-05-14T12:37:00.000Z	kajo	EgYPaRaDoX	I don't. It's not being mounted, or even detected as far as I can tell.
2010-05-14T12:38:00.000Z	EgYPaRaDoX	kajo	Is it new?
2010-05-14T12:39:00.000Z	EgYPaRaDoX	kajo	Do you have gparted installed?
2010-05-14T12:39:00.000Z	kajo	EgYPaRaDoX	on the external harddrive? No. On my computer? Isn't it default included with Ubuntu? I assume it's there, though I haven't used it in a while.
2010-05-14T12:40:00.000Z	EgYPaRaDoX	kajo	Open GParted
2010-05-14T12:41:00.000Z	kajo	EgYPaRaDoX	llutz, see the pastebin: http://paste.ubuntu.com/433216/
2010-05-14T12:41:00.000Z	kajo	EgYPaRaDoX	what will I be doing? I can't partition it, it's not my harddrive.
2010-05-14T12:42:00.000Z	EgYPaRaDoX	kajo	Dont open it.
2010-05-14T12:42:00.000Z	kajo	EgYPaRaDoX	don't open what?
2010-05-14T12:44:00.000Z	EgYPaRaDoX	kajo	Anyway it doesnt matter since normally WD disks are formatted
2010-05-14T12:47:00.000Z	EgYPaRaDoX	kajo	Try another computer
2010-05-14T12:47:00.000Z	kajo	EgYPaRaDoX	I'd love to, but being a student I am not so privledged.
2010-05-14T12:48:00.000Z	EgYPaRaDoX	kajo	I understand , since I am a student myself.
2010-05-14T12:50:00.000Z	EgYPaRaDoX	kajo	Do you have another OS on your box?
2010-05-14T12:50:00.000Z	kajo	EgYPaRaDoX	I have a 5gig partition with tinyxp
2010-05-14T12:50:00.000Z	EgYPaRaDoX	kajo	Doesn't work there also?
2010-05-14T12:51:00.000Z	kajo	EgYPaRaDoX	no, tinyxp also doesn't see it, which points to hardware problem.
