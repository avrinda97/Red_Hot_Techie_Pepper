2011-11-11T03:19:00.000Z	glebihan	Forage__	to be able to disable auto login, you would need to be able to write some configuration files on the CD itself, which is impossible
2011-11-11T03:19:00.000Z	Forage__	glebihan	I"m on usb ;-)
2011-11-11T03:21:00.000Z	Forage__	glebihan	sorry, I of the assumption that all or putting the livecd on usb, though I should have mentioned it
2011-11-11T03:21:00.000Z	glebihan	Forage__	well the live CD has been designed to be burnt to a CD not a USB
2011-11-11T03:21:00.000Z	Forage__	glebihan	does it make it possible now in usb by any chance? ;-)
2011-11-11T03:21:00.000Z	glebihan	Forage__	I don't think so
2011-11-11T03:25:00.000Z	glebihan	Forage__	you can ?
2011-11-11T03:26:00.000Z	Forage__	glebihan	ow yeah! It's persistent, settings, documents and packages all remain available after boot
2011-11-11T03:26:00.000Z	glebihan	Forage__	then I guess there must be a way to prevent autologin
2011-11-11T03:26:00.000Z	Forage__	glebihan	thought so
2011-11-11T03:29:00.000Z	Forage__	glebihan	and by the looks of it /usr/share/initramfs-tools/scripts/casper-bottom/15autologin must be the part that causes the auto login. Maybe something is going wrong with updating initramfs after removing that file
2011-11-11T03:29:00.000Z	glebihan	Forage__	edit /etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf and try modifiying the autologin parameters in there
2011-11-11T03:35:00.000Z	Forage__	glebihan	that must be the one, too bad the possible options aren't included in the man
2011-11-11T03:36:00.000Z	glebihan	Forage__	I think that if you remove the value from autologin-user, it should be ok
2011-11-11T03:37:00.000Z	Forage__	glebihan	there's also autologin-user-timeout and autologin-session
2011-11-11T03:37:00.000Z	glebihan	Forage__	afaik those won't be used if autologin-user is not set
2011-11-11T03:37:00.000Z	Forage__	glebihan	especially autologin-session=lightdm-autologin
2011-11-11T03:37:00.000Z	Forage__	glebihan	ah, ok
