2008-09-04T05:17:00.000Z	jrib	Guest882	don't use enter to break up your thoughts as it makes it harder to follow what you are saying
2008-09-04T05:18:00.000Z	jrib	Guest882	did you choose the  "verify the integrity of the cd" option?
2008-09-04T05:18:00.000Z	jrib	Guest882	when you boot from the cd, choose the "verify the integrity of the cd" option
2008-09-04T05:18:00.000Z	jrib	Guest882	what cd are you using?
2008-09-04T05:20:00.000Z	jrib	Guest882	what cd did you download?
2008-09-04T05:21:00.000Z	jrib	Guest882	well download a supported version of ubuntu
2008-09-04T05:22:00.000Z	Guest882	jrib	I'm going to download a new cd and try to boot from it
2008-09-04T05:22:00.000Z	jrib	Guest882	k
2008-09-04T05:22:00.000Z	Guest882	jrib	I'm trying to recover data from a "failed" windows hard drive
2008-09-04T05:22:00.000Z	jrib	Guest882	make sure you check the md5sum of your download before you burn and then "verify the integrity of the cd" from the first screen when you boot the dvd
2008-09-04T05:23:00.000Z	Guest882	jrib	I still don't know what this verify integrity option is. I don't get it.
2008-09-04T05:25:00.000Z	Guest882	jrib	once I download the ubuntu ISO, I burn it to the disc, right?
2008-09-04T05:25:00.000Z	jrib	Guest882	you check the md5sum first.  Then you burn it to a disk
2008-09-04T05:25:00.000Z	Guest882	jrib	how do I check that?
2008-09-04T05:27:00.000Z	Guest882	jrib	is it normal for the iso to take 2 hours to download?
2008-09-04T05:27:00.000Z	jrib	Guest882	depends on your download speed
