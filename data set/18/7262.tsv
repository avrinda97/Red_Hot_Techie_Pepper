2009-10-06T03:20:00.000Z	shaffy		can anyone tell me how to convert the ubuntu 9.04 netbook remix "img" to a bootable ".iso"?  or anyway at all to make just a regular bootable cd/dvd with the *.img file that is provided on the ubuntu website?
2009-10-06T03:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shaffy	 ccd2iso /path/to/example.img /path/to/example.iso
2009-10-06T03:23:00.000Z	shaffy	ActionParsnip	i've tried many windows apps (poweriso, magiciso, etc) to convert it to an ISO but it says the IMG file is not a valid image.  i've been really confused.  i've even tried to burn the IMG with nero (in windows) and the DVD just keeps showing up blank (ive done this several times)
2009-10-06T03:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shaffy	did yuo md5 check the img?
2009-10-06T03:25:00.000Z	shaffy	ActionParsnip	i did not.  let me do that now.  will get right back to you.  thx.
2009-10-06T03:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shaffy	if you have the option. ALWAYS MD5 check ISO and IMG files
2009-10-06T03:32:00.000Z	shaffy	ActionParsnip	the IMG passed the md5sum
2009-10-06T03:38:00.000Z	shaffy	ActionParsnip	anymore ideas on creating a bootable cd/dvd from the IMG file?
2009-10-06T03:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shaffy	not sure, thats all i got
2009-10-06T03:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shaffy	remember toALWAYS MD5 check before using ISO and IMG files
2009-10-06T03:39:00.000Z	shaffy	ActionParsnip	i can extract the entire IMG to a folder using poweriso -- but i don't know how to make the contents "bootable" when i burn it to a dvd
2009-10-06T03:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shaffy	that wont work
2009-10-06T03:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shaffy	do you have a USB stick you can boot from, its faster than CD and a hell of a lot more reliable
2009-10-06T03:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shaffy	burning a CD IMG to a DVD can get messy
2009-10-06T03:42:00.000Z	shaffy	ActionParsnip	that's just the problem -- i dont have a USB :(((
2009-10-06T03:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shaffy	or sd card?
2009-10-06T03:43:00.000Z	shaffy	ActionParsnip	will my computer boot from an SD card?
2009-10-06T03:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	shaffy	some can, some cant
