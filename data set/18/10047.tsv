2007-02-13T13:11:00.000Z	unop	Hmmmm	 then just add 'ro' to the options for that entry in /etc/fstab

2007-02-13T13:12:00.000Z	unop	Hmmmm	yep .. seperated by a comma tho -- defaults,ro -- or better simply ro
2007-02-13T13:13:00.000Z	Hmmmm	unop	okay. done. i want to run the recover command on that filesystem
2007-02-13T13:13:00.000Z	unop	Hmmmm	 errm, i should have thought you need the partition to be writeable  .. anyway, i'm not sure
2007-02-13T13:14:00.000Z	unop	Hmmmm	 you have to remount the partition tho, for the changes to take effect
2007-02-13T13:14:00.000Z	Hmmmm	unop	im rebooting the machine
2007-02-13T13:15:00.000Z	unop	Hmmmm	 you dont need to do that -- just -- sudo sh -c "umount /dev/sda6; mount /dev/sda6"
