2009-10-10T15:04:00.000Z	KurtKraut	wizzo50	I own another model of HP Photosmart series and I had just to plug it to my computer (while the printer is on) and Ubuntu just recognized that.
2009-10-10T15:04:00.000Z	wizzo50	KurtKraut	The printer part works but not my scanner
2009-10-10T15:05:00.000Z	KurtKraut	wizzo50	what software you're using to scan?
2009-10-10T15:05:00.000Z	wizzo50	KurtKraut	The software that came with it
2009-10-10T15:06:00.000Z	KurtKraut	wizzo50	it won't work because this software is for Windows only, not to Linux.
2009-10-10T15:06:00.000Z	KurtKraut	wizzo50	I use Gimp to scan.
2009-10-10T15:12:00.000Z	wizzo50	KurtKraut	How do you use The Gimp to scan?
2009-10-10T15:14:00.000Z	KurtKraut	wizzo50	you'll find an 'Xsane' option inside the 'File' menu
2009-10-10T15:15:00.000Z	wizzo50	KurtKraut	Yes, I have clicked on that, then where? How you use it?
2009-10-10T15:17:00.000Z	KurtKraut	wizzo50	so more windows have appeared and one of them with a big logo of Xsane, right?
2009-10-10T15:17:00.000Z	wizzo50	KurtKraut	Yes
2009-10-10T15:18:00.000Z	KurtKraut	wizzo50	so try figuring out by clicking in buttons. I'm using Ubuntu in portuguese here. I don't know the labels of the buttons you're seeing there. But it should be quit intuitive, something like 'Capture' or 'Digitalize'.
