2008-02-08T21:20:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Faust-C	Welcome to Ubuntu
2008-12-22T20:43:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Faust-C	are you manually selecting the icon theme ?
2008-12-22T20:44:00.000Z	Faust-C	Jack_Sparrow	doing it via the theme manager
2008-12-22T20:45:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Faust-C	IN the theme manager you are manually selecting a new icon themem, or just drag and drop
2008-12-22T20:45:00.000Z	Faust-C	Jack_Sparrow	drag and drop
2008-12-22T20:46:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Faust-C	theme, customize and click the icons tab
2008-12-22T20:46:00.000Z	Faust-C	Jack_Sparrow	yeah did that and the new icon themes dont work but ones that came w/ ubuntu do
2008-12-22T20:47:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Faust-C	then the theme/icons selected/added are not compatibler
2008-12-22T20:48:00.000Z	Faust-C	Jack_Sparrow	ah great :(, ok thx
2008-12-22T20:50:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Faust-C	It just could be they are the wrong size etc and sometimes can be fixed, but way easier to find another similar that works
