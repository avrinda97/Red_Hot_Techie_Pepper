2007-03-25T16:01:00.000Z	kikkymonk		all the windows take time to load... there is a general sense of laggyness to my whole system now... is does ubuntu run slower or faster than XP on a given machine?
2007-03-25T16:02:00.000Z	kikkymonk		somethings up then
2007-03-25T16:02:00.000Z	kikkymonk		does ubunutu come with video drivers? i have an nvidia 6600gt
2007-03-25T16:04:00.000Z	kikkymonk		i had a suspicion that it was my video driver but when i went into applications->add/remove it showed i already had nvidia binary x.org driver installed
2007-03-25T16:04:00.000Z	pike_	kikkymonk	do you get the nvidia splash screen when the login loads?
2007-03-25T16:05:00.000Z	kikkymonk	pike_	don't think so
2007-03-25T16:05:00.000Z	kikkymonk		i'll give https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
2007-03-25T16:05:00.000Z	kikkymonk		hlst0 in terminal?
2007-03-25T16:06:00.000Z	kikkymonk		direct rendering: No
2007-03-25T16:06:00.000Z	kikkymonk		OpenGL renderer string: Mesa GLX Indirect
2007-03-25T16:06:00.000Z	kikkymonk		and direct rendering is set to no
2007-03-25T16:06:00.000Z	pike_	kikkymonk	ive never bothered with the nvidia-glx package ive just used nvidia's installer but if you do that youll have to rerun it whenever you upgrade the kernel. if thats ok do a google search for like 'ubuntu nvidia latest' or something
2007-03-25T16:06:00.000Z	kikkymonk		yeah i thought so
2007-03-25T16:06:00.000Z	kikkymonk		6600gt nvidia
2007-03-25T16:08:00.000Z	kikkymonk		when i nvidia-xconfig i got Using X configuration file: "/etc/X11/xorg.conf". ERROR: Unable to write to directory '/etc/X11'.
2007-03-25T16:08:00.000Z	kikkymonk		darn sudo : P
2007-03-25T16:13:00.000Z	kikkymonk		muuuuuch better... thanks all
