2005-09-29T05:29:00.000Z	boxerboy29		rc comes out on oct 3 and final on oct 13
2005-09-29T05:30:00.000Z	boxerboy29		yes when the final comes out
2005-09-29T05:30:00.000Z	boxerboy29		yw
2005-09-29T05:32:00.000Z	boxerboy29		i found out with all the repos you can get java plug in from synaptic
2005-09-29T05:33:00.000Z	apokryphos	boxerboy29	well, with a different one, yes.
2005-09-29T05:35:00.000Z	apokryphos	boxerboy29	it's not in any of the Ubuntu-provided ones
2005-09-29T05:36:00.000Z	apokryphos	boxerboy29	what is it you're looking for? Just the java plugin (for your browser etc)? j2re?
2005-09-29T05:37:00.000Z	apokryphos	boxerboy29	it's not
2005-10-06T15:46:00.000Z	apokryphos	boxerboy29	you have to restart to change the kernel you're using
2005-10-06T15:47:00.000Z	apokryphos	boxerboy29	well, what one is it you're trying to install?
2005-10-06T15:47:00.000Z	apokryphos	boxerboy29	...and you currently have
2005-10-06T15:48:00.000Z	apokryphos	boxerboy29	obv. you're going to have to give more information. For what CPU are you getting it then?
2005-10-06T15:49:00.000Z	apokryphos	boxerboy29	so what exactly is the problem? It's not changing to the "same kernel"?
2005-10-06T15:50:00.000Z	apokryphos	boxerboy29	what "updates"? That's unbelievably vague
2005-10-06T15:51:00.000Z	apokryphos	boxerboy29	so what's the actual problem?
2005-10-06T15:53:00.000Z	apokryphos	boxerboy29	it might well have been a different packaged version of the new kernel; that means that the actual *kernel number* wouldn't change
2005-10-13T09:55:00.000Z	apokryphos	boxerboy29	average joe has many problems ;-)
2005-10-13T10:36:00.000Z	apokryphos	boxerboy29	why would it not work?
