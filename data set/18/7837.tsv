2008-03-25T09:42:00.000Z	Peddy		can someone please tell me if the easy-access audio ports at the front of my PC are worse quality than the ones at the back?
2008-03-25T09:42:00.000Z	Svenstaro	Peddy	they are because of interference and cable length, but its doubtful you can hear the difference
2008-03-25T09:44:00.000Z	Peddy	Svenstaro	so it still uses HD audio?
2008-03-25T09:44:00.000Z	Peddy	Svenstaro	its onboard HD audio btw
2008-03-25T09:44:00.000Z	Svenstaro	Peddy	technically yes, but from an analog viewpoint your soundquality decreases
2008-03-25T09:45:00.000Z	Peddy	Svenstaro	ok, thanks :) and its not physically that far away, because my 'front' sound ports are not in 'front' in that sense. They are on top (closer to the mobo).
2008-03-25T09:46:00.000Z	Peddy	Svenstaro	am I off-topic?
2008-03-25T09:46:00.000Z	Svenstaro	Peddy	uhm, well it doesnt really concern Ubuntu what you asked, tho im still happy to help :)
2008-03-25T09:48:00.000Z	Svenstaro	Peddy	np
2008-03-27T09:28:00.000Z	Svenstaro	Peddy	its okay
2008-03-27T09:29:00.000Z	Peddy	Svenstaro	cheers mate ;)
2008-03-27T09:29:00.000Z	Svenstaro	Peddy	starting at 75Â° its getting too hot
2008-03-27T09:30:00.000Z	Svenstaro	Peddy	usually not, if you turn up the voltages too high, it will break
2008-03-27T09:32:00.000Z	Peddy	Svenstaro	I've overclocked a 1.86 to 3.4
2008-03-27T09:33:00.000Z	Svenstaro	Peddy	is there a 1.86 quodcore?
2008-03-27T09:35:00.000Z	Peddy	Svenstaro	so I went out to buy a 2.4GHz, and it wouldn't even overclock. i got a bad batch or something ^^
2008-03-27T09:35:00.000Z	Svenstaro	Peddy	:P
2008-03-27T09:36:00.000Z	Peddy	Svenstaro	yep
