2009-07-04T16:55:00.000Z	kyle_	gca	im trying to think of hotkeys
2009-07-04T16:57:00.000Z	kyle_	gca	you should probably enable your graphics card
2009-07-04T16:57:00.000Z	kyle_	gca	ummm.... i'm stumped
2009-07-04T16:58:00.000Z	gca	kyle_	, i am not a newbie, i've been using only ubuntu since 3 years ago
2009-07-04T16:58:00.000Z	kyle_	gca	yeah... i don't know about your mouse
2009-07-04T16:59:00.000Z	kyle_	gca	no problem
