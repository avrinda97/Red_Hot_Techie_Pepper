2011-04-30T19:58:00.000Z	kwtm	Crazy1	It is a regex that describes a pattern to look for in text.  It means:  a word (meaning consecutive letters or numbers), followed by some whitespace (space, tabs, etc.), followed by that same word
2011-04-30T19:59:00.000Z	Crazy1	kwtm	can you give me an example?
2011-04-30T19:59:00.000Z	kwtm	Crazy1	So, if your text contained   "This is a frog frog." then the "frog frog" part would match.
2011-04-30T19:59:00.000Z	Crazy1	kwtm	i tried like this 123 123,but it didn't work
2011-04-30T20:00:00.000Z	kwtm	Crazy1	If your text contained "This is a bullfrog frog" then it would not match because it takes the entire bullfrog word.
2011-04-30T20:00:00.000Z	Crazy1	kwtm	let me try it
2011-04-30T20:00:00.000Z	kwtm	Crazy1	If you "tried 123 123" then you already know that this is a regular expression.
2011-04-30T20:00:00.000Z	kwtm	Crazy1	In that case, you should ask at #regex or ##regex.
2011-04-30T20:01:00.000Z	Crazy1	kwtm	i am learning the   regular expression now
2011-04-30T20:02:00.000Z	kwtm	Crazy1	It is not related to ubuntu.
2011-04-30T20:02:00.000Z	Crazy1	kwtm	ok..
2011-04-30T20:02:00.000Z	Crazy1	kwtm	i went to #regexask for help
