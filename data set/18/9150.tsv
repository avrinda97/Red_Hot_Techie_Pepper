2007-05-11T12:25:00.000Z	EhPrettyEasy		Will the normal Ubuntu installation let me be able to do dual boot? Windows + Ubuntu
2007-05-11T12:26:00.000Z	EhPrettyEasy		So
2007-05-11T12:26:00.000Z	EhPrettyEasy		You mean that if I go through the normal installation
2007-05-11T12:26:00.000Z	EhPrettyEasy		It won't delete Windows?
2007-05-11T12:26:00.000Z	EhPrettyEasy		Yeah i have windows now
2007-05-11T12:27:00.000Z	EhPrettyEasy		And ubuntu cd with me
2007-05-11T12:27:00.000Z	Terrasque	EhPrettyEasy	you get a menu when the machine start
2007-05-11T12:28:00.000Z	Terrasque	EhPrettyEasy	ubuntu can resize an exisiting partition under install. but you can also use partition manager, or gparted.
2007-05-11T12:32:00.000Z	Terrasque	EhPrettyEasy	"please specify size after partition" - put in 10000
2007-05-11T12:32:00.000Z	EhPrettyEasy	Terrasque	Wouldn't that resize my C: to 10gb when it's 143gb now?
2007-05-11T12:33:00.000Z	Terrasque	EhPrettyEasy	no, it would allocate 10 gb after the partition
2007-05-11T12:35:00.000Z	Terrasque	EhPrettyEasy	let ubuntu partition the free space
2007-05-11T12:36:00.000Z	Terrasque	EhPrettyEasy	it havent happened even once when ive installed ubuntu. And that is about 10 times on 4 different computers
2007-05-11T12:37:00.000Z	Terrasque	EhPrettyEasy	of course, if you tell it to delete everything, it will
2007-05-11T12:38:00.000Z	Terrasque	EhPrettyEasy	http://www.linuxlibrarian.org/node/319 - look at Prepare disk space
2007-05-11T12:39:00.000Z	Terrasque	EhPrettyEasy	if you have some partitions on disk, but free space, it will come up with "use avaliable free space". Chose that, next, and ubuntu will do the rest
2007-05-11T12:42:00.000Z	Terrasque	EhPrettyEasy	as i said, if you have unpartitioned space, ubuntu will give you an extra choice
2007-05-11T12:45:00.000Z	Terrasque	EhPrettyEasy	if you do not have free space it will show something like this : http://www.cdprof.com/formation/linux/images/ubuntu-install.png - its french, but it allows you to resize one partition
