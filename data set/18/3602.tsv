2010-09-13T14:53:00.000Z	abhijit	Madjimms	this is my personal experience and oponion: install one desktop enviroment on another is good but removing is bad. if you want to test then have separate installations in real hdd or use virtual box
2010-09-13T14:55:00.000Z	abhijit	Madjimms	then why you instaled xfce? install ubuntu ?
2010-09-13T14:57:00.000Z	abhijit	Madjimms	you can now install gnome using sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
2010-09-13T14:58:00.000Z	abhijit	Madjimms	log out and then in the screen where we select user and and type password there on the bottom there is option to select desktop enviroment i.e. xfce or gnome or termiinal etc select gnome
