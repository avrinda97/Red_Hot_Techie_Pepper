2011-06-20T00:15:00.000Z	RenatoSilva		how to restore volume control next to the clock? it disappeared, can't recall when
2011-06-20T00:16:00.000Z	Ampelbein	RenatoSilva	what desktop environment?
2011-06-20T00:19:00.000Z	RenatoSilva	Ampelbein	what that means exactly? whether unity or classic?
2011-06-20T00:19:00.000Z	RenatoSilva	Ampelbein	Unity is RIDICULOUS. Regardless, I can't see the volume control in both
2011-06-20T00:19:00.000Z	Ampelbein	RenatoSilva	is indicator-sound installed?
2011-06-20T00:20:00.000Z	RenatoSilva	Ampelbein	lms
2011-06-20T00:22:00.000Z	RenatoSilva	Ampelbein	yes, installed. It seems the icon disappeared some point of time. MAYBE after today's upgrade 10.10 > 11.04, of which I'm very regretful
2011-06-20T00:23:00.000Z	Ampelbein	RenatoSilva	but you do have sound on your system?
2011-06-20T00:25:00.000Z	RenatoSilva	Ampelbein	yes, and I'm able to System > Preferences > Sound, and control the volume, but that sucks, I want the icon
2011-06-20T00:26:00.000Z	RenatoSilva	Ampelbein	also, my keyboard has volume control, which shows a dark widget when used. But the original icon which should be next to the clock, it's not there
2011-06-20T00:28:00.000Z	Ampelbein	RenatoSilva	hmm, I don't know. Please file a bug with launchpad about this.
2011-06-20T00:31:00.000Z	RenatoSilva	Ampelbein	thanks anyway. For sure there is a way, every or most of trouble I have been having with ubuntu are matter of some simple, stupid procedure. My issues seems related to the fact I'm an always upgrading user (I don't do a clean install since a long time)
2011-06-20T00:33:00.000Z	Ampelbein	RenatoSilva	I didn't install since 8.10 (intrepid ibex), no such problems here. but then again, I regulary clean out cruft.
2011-06-20T00:34:00.000Z	RenatoSilva	Ampelbein	sorry what that means, clean out cruft?
2011-06-20T00:35:00.000Z	Ampelbein	RenatoSilva	going through the list of installed packages and remove old ones, check for dangling config files, purge packages that were only removed etc.
2011-06-20T00:35:00.000Z	Ampelbein	RenatoSilva	like spring cleaning in your house ;-)
2011-06-20T00:41:00.000Z	RenatoSilva	Ampelbein	I do that in my installation too
2011-06-20T00:41:00.000Z	RenatoSilva	Ampelbein	btw this hidden scrollbar in 11.04 is terrible
