2005-05-14T11:41:00.000Z	mak		I have a ton of OOo2 packages in '.deb' files. How would i go about installing all of them?
2005-05-14T11:41:00.000Z	karsten	mak	dpkg -i <package list>
2005-05-14T11:42:00.000Z	mak	karsten	will dpkg figure out what to install first, last, etc?
2005-05-14T11:42:00.000Z	karsten	mak	Yes.
2005-05-14T11:42:00.000Z	karsten	mak	In general, you're better off using aptitude or synaptic.
2005-05-14T11:43:00.000Z	karsten	mak	...why'd you d/l the packages instead of 'aptitude install ... ' ?
2005-05-14T11:44:00.000Z	mak	karsten	the ones that are there are pretty old (m79), current is m100. is it not a big deal?

2005-05-14T11:44:00.000Z	karsten	mak	What OS are you coming from?
2005-05-14T11:45:00.000Z	mak	karsten	I've been messing with linux for about a year
2005-05-14T11:45:00.000Z	karsten	mak	What APT (A Package Tool), Ubuntu's package manager, buys you, is resolving dependencies between packages.
2005-05-14T11:46:00.000Z	karsten	mak	If you go outside of it, you're taking a risk of getting incompatible stuff on your system.
2005-05-14T11:46:00.000Z	karsten	mak	IME, going for the latest and greatest rarely provides compelling advantages.
2005-05-14T11:46:00.000Z	mak	karsten	last time. I promise :). hope nothing got screwed up too bad
2005-05-14T11:47:00.000Z	mak	karsten	actually, I cant find where the packages just installed
2005-05-14T11:47:00.000Z	karsten	mak	If they're DEBs and built for Ubuntu, you may be OK.  There are third party repositories, I use a few.
2005-05-14T11:48:00.000Z	mak	karsten	i doubt they are. I got them from the site
2005-05-14T12:03:00.000Z	karsten	mak	IMVAO, the one Ubuntu provides you.
