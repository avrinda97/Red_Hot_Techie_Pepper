2005-03-10T16:12:00.000Z	acolyte		ok, here's what I want to do
2005-03-10T16:13:00.000Z	acolyte		I want to make a backup of my /home folder to either an usb stick or a CD-RW
2005-03-10T16:13:00.000Z	acolyte		I'm on a liveCD atm but my usb stick isn't detected/mounted properly
2005-03-10T16:14:00.000Z	Jerub	acolyte	are you sure? insert the usb device and type 'dmesg'
2005-03-10T16:15:00.000Z	Jerub		you should see it being detected and given an /dev/sd* entry
2005-03-10T16:16:00.000Z	acolyte	Jerub	I get alot of errors :(
2005-03-10T16:17:00.000Z	acolyte	Jerub	sda1: rw=0, want=3, limit=2

2005-03-10T16:17:00.000Z	Jerub		what about /dev/sda insead of /dev/sda1 ?
2005-03-10T16:18:00.000Z	acolyte	Jerub	well, what do I have to do then to check if it's on sda?
2005-03-10T16:18:00.000Z	Jerub		mount /dev/sda /mnt
2005-03-10T16:18:00.000Z	Jerub		or similar.
2005-03-10T16:19:00.000Z	acolyte		tuxicity: will try that
2005-03-10T16:20:00.000Z	acolyte	Jerub	mount: you must specify the filesystem type (now I know it is vfat but how to put that in the command?)
