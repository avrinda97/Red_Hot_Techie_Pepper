2012-08-14T12:26:00.000Z	Anomie21		Can anyone help me figure out how to get my images working on my homepage here http://ablemagazine.co.uk/ ? This is what is says on the place I downloaded the theme. I can't find any other information and the theme author won't answer my emails.[Insert image in a post/page using Custom Field. In the Excerpt mode (see example in the homepage) it shows a thumbnail size, in posts page it shows a full size image.]. I've tried check

2012-08-14T13:01:00.000Z	Auzy		Either way. you can do it by scripting
2012-08-14T13:01:00.000Z	Auzy		you could also use awk maybe
2012-08-14T13:02:00.000Z	Auzy		you'd have to google it.. if you think you might need it often, it could even be worth learning Bash scripting
2012-08-14T13:02:00.000Z	Auzy		You could also code something quickly in php / Perl.. it doesn't take too long
2012-08-14T13:03:00.000Z	Auzy		If you know how to use Perl, or even PHP, you could code it in that
2012-08-14T13:04:00.000Z	Auzy		http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6161338/searching-string-in-a-file-and-outputting-the-line-number might help paulus68
2012-08-14T13:05:00.000Z	Auzy		or grep.. I have no idea.. I'd have to look at it lol
2012-08-14T13:05:00.000Z	Auzy		easiest way.. Just use a GUI tool..
2012-08-21T16:48:00.000Z	Anomie21		I need to uninvite 1,000 people from a facebook page; is there a macro application for ubuntu? (I need to click the X with my mouse and then hit enter to delete 1 person)
2012-08-21T16:49:00.000Z	Auzy	Anomie21	Not the right channel.. but, why not just delete the page?
2012-08-21T16:50:00.000Z	Anomie21	Auzy	Lots of info on it. Looking for a macro program that'll run on ubuntu, cant find anything online
