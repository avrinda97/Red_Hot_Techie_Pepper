2005-04-05T15:32:00.000Z	_blue		_so what's the advantages of kubuntu over ubuntu?
2005-04-05T15:32:00.000Z	_blue		just the k environment?
2005-04-05T15:32:00.000Z	_blue		interesting....although id be running flux not kde
2005-04-05T15:33:00.000Z	_blue		but i use kde apps frequently though

2005-04-05T15:34:00.000Z	_blue		what is ubuntu's equivalent to mandrake control center?
2005-04-05T15:34:00.000Z	_blue		leejunfan: well mandrake has bash too
2005-04-05T15:34:00.000Z	chavo	_blue	nothing like mcc
2005-04-05T15:34:00.000Z	_blue		booyah
2005-04-05T15:35:00.000Z	_blue		o, ok, thx chavo
2005-04-05T15:35:00.000Z	chavo		but I haven't missed it.
2005-04-05T15:35:00.000Z	_blue	chavo	i need something abit more advanced than mandrake, b/c i need a bit of a learning curve to get me exploring
2005-04-05T15:35:00.000Z	chavo		Everything has worked out of the box for me.
2005-04-05T15:35:00.000Z	_blue		but archlinux seems just a bit too far out for me right now
2005-04-05T15:35:00.000Z	chavo	_blue	you can learn on any linux system.
