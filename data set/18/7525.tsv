2008-06-01T04:26:00.000Z	Jalathan		try having it place the temp file there
2008-06-01T04:26:00.000Z	Jalathan		np
2008-06-01T04:27:00.000Z	Thingus	Jalathan	Yeah?
2008-06-01T04:24:00.000Z	Jalathan	Thingus	hrm, might there be not enough room in /tmp to hold the temporary ISO image?
2008-06-01T04:24:00.000Z	Thingus	Jalathan	You could be right.
2008-06-01T04:25:00.000Z	Jalathan	Thingus	do you have another partition that could handle it?
2008-06-01T04:26:00.000Z	Thingus	Jalathan	Okay.
2008-06-01T04:27:00.000Z	Jalathan	Thingus	wait
2008-06-01T04:28:00.000Z	Jalathan	Thingus	nm, thought i misread something
2008-06-01T04:28:00.000Z	Thingus	Jalathan	Hold on...
2008-06-01T04:30:00.000Z	Thingus	Jalathan	Here's the log from Braesero: http://paste.ubuntu.com/16087/
2008-06-01T04:35:00.000Z	Jalathan	Thingus	one minute...
2008-06-01T05:03:00.000Z	Jalathan	Thingus	*sigh* this is irritating.  I'm afraid that I can't help you on this, as the configuration files for Brasero are nonexistent from what I can tell... -_-
2008-06-01T05:03:00.000Z	Jalathan	Thingus	do you have any of the kde libraries installed?
2008-06-01T05:04:00.000Z	Thingus	Jalathan	No.
2008-06-01T05:04:00.000Z	Thingus	Jalathan	But, I'm installing K3b anyway.
2008-06-01T05:05:00.000Z	Jalathan	Thingus	you preemptively answered my question.. :)
2008-06-01T05:08:00.000Z	Jalathan	Thingus	within K3B you can select the directory to temporarily store the file under "Settings > Configure K3b...".  I have to wish you luck, as I need to hop off.
