2008-09-27T06:15:00.000Z	gimpy530		this happens with a second ubuntu box as well, but the share works in windows and had no issues a week ago
2008-09-27T06:16:00.000Z	gimpy530		that username and pass is fake, didnt want to put my real one in there!
2008-09-27T06:16:00.000Z	gimpy530		yes
2008-09-27T06:16:00.000Z	gimpy530		works fine a my Vista box and XP box, but not on either Ubuntu boxes
2008-09-27T06:17:00.000Z	gimpy530		yes I have
2008-09-27T06:18:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	gimpy530	have you tried using smbclient to see if it is mount or cifs causing the issue?
2008-09-27T06:20:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	gimpy530	permissons
2008-09-27T06:21:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	gimpy530	check the permissions on the Windows PC
2008-09-27T06:22:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	gimpy530	You might want to run Wireshark and monitor the SMB traffic to see what the Windows PC is reporting
2008-09-27T06:22:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	gimpy530	No!, *permissions* on the Windows NTFS directory/files, and the share
2008-09-27T06:23:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	gimpy530	Also, if Windows is refusing it the reports will be in the Event log
2008-09-27T06:24:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	gimpy530	read my lips! The NTFS file-system permissions ON THE WINDOWS PC may have changed - that would cause the error you report
2008-09-27T06:26:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	gimpy530	So what does the Windows PC event log report when the Linux PC attempts to connect?
2008-09-27T06:27:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	gimpy530	Like I said before, it would be a good idea to use Wireshark to view the SMB traffic on the wire, then you can see precisely what is being said by both ends
2008-09-27T06:29:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	gimpy530	That's good then... that means you know it is local to the Linux PC
2008-09-27T06:29:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	gimpy530	I found a reference for mount which says:
2008-09-27T06:29:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	gimpy530	triple-check the mount point :)
2008-09-27T06:30:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	gimpy530	But, the best thing is to use Wireshark
