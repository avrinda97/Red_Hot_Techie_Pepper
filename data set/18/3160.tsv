2011-04-05T20:37:00.000Z	truepurple		Do you guys believe that installing the ATI 70mb driver for a radeon 6850 is a bad idea? Is it a bad driver?
2011-04-05T20:38:00.000Z	vanguard	truepurple	well, on the 2600 the ATI driver works better than the free driver
2011-04-05T20:38:00.000Z	truepurple	vanguard	Your speaking from personal experience?
2011-04-05T20:39:00.000Z	vanguard	truepurple	yeah, I have a 2600 Mobility here and Urban Terror runs with like 15 fps on free drivers and 127+ with the ati driver
2011-04-05T20:39:00.000Z	vanguard	truepurple	desktop effects work fine with either driver
2011-04-05T20:40:00.000Z	truepurple	vanguard	I seem to have at least three options, one I can enable that comes preinstalled with ubuntu, one I can download through "additional drivers" and the ATI one (which I am not actually sure how to install) How do I get a good comparison between them?
2011-04-05T20:41:00.000Z	vanguard	truepurple	Try them out I'd say. I installed mine through the "additional drivers". Usually, you do not install stuff by downloading it frome website in linux
2011-04-05T20:42:00.000Z	truepurple	vanguard	The additional drivers is the same as the 70mb one, and it worked well for you?
2011-04-05T20:42:00.000Z	vanguard	truepurple	I have to check the size, wait a minute
2011-04-05T20:44:00.000Z	vanguard	truepurple	I do not know where to find the size but I used "ATI/AMD: proprietary FGLRX-Graphics Driver" (translated from German, does not need to be accurate)
2011-04-05T20:45:00.000Z	truepurple	vanguard	from within "additional drivers"?
2011-04-05T20:45:00.000Z	vanguard	truepurple	yes.
2011-04-05T20:46:00.000Z	truepurple	vanguard	So no real issues with your additional drivers download? They work well? I can always uninstall latter right?
2011-04-05T20:47:00.000Z	vanguard	truepurple	it worked two times on this Mac, one on Ubuntu and Kubuntu. You can uninstall the driver later on. You have a backup of your personal files, right?
2011-04-05T20:47:00.000Z	truepurple	vanguard	Not sure what you mean by a backup of my personal files
2011-04-05T20:48:00.000Z	vanguard	truepurple	I mean just in case your computer explodes, you have a copy of your personal data. I do not think anything would happen, but a backup is never a bad idea
2011-04-05T20:50:00.000Z	truepurple	vanguard	I have alot of data to sort out and get off a old drive, then I might be able to use that old drive for backup. But its difficult, most personal data is video files and other things that take up space that the old drive couldn't handle, and keeping up with backups is a pain
2011-04-05T20:51:00.000Z	vanguard	truepurple	well, then just install the driver, personally, I freak out if I do not have my data at least three times ;-)
