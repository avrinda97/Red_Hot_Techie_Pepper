2006-10-02T10:04:00.000Z	john		<JoseStefan>, say for a test folder, what would I put into terminal?
2006-10-02T10:05:00.000Z	john		I want 711 for the file
2006-10-02T10:05:00.000Z	john		<JoseStefan>
2006-10-02T10:05:00.000Z	Flannel	john	it's chmod perm file if you just want to set it
2006-10-02T10:11:00.000Z	Flannel	john	stop pasting here
2006-10-02T10:11:00.000Z	Flannel	john	you hvae to go to the website to paste
2006-10-02T10:12:00.000Z	Flannel	john	then you paste the url here
2006-10-02T10:15:00.000Z	Flannel	john	you might try asking in #winehq
2007-06-25T09:59:00.000Z	Flannel	john	you should remvoe the packages, not just the files.  And remember to do it all with --purge (or "complete removal" in synaptic)
2007-06-25T10:01:00.000Z	Flannel	john	in synaptic?  You flag them for "complete removal" as opposed to just "removal"
2007-06-25T10:02:00.000Z	Flannel	john	right click on the little box thing, and choose c.r.
2007-06-25T10:05:00.000Z	Flannel	john	on which package?  There's more than one that make up kde.  the .desktop file is in either kdebase-data or ksmserver, completely remove both of those, and you should have kde no longer in sessions.
2007-06-25T10:06:00.000Z	Flannel	john	Are they installed?
2007-06-25T10:08:00.000Z	Flannel	john	at a terminal, (close synaptic), `sudo apt-get remove --purge kdebase-data ksmserver`  I'm assuming the file is kde.desktop, but I don't know for sure.
2007-06-25T10:08:00.000Z	Flannel	john	if you could give me an exact filename, we can figure out what package it came from
2007-06-25T10:09:00.000Z	Flannel	john	you need to close synaptic
2007-08-06T08:51:00.000Z	Flannel	john	install ntfs-config, and there'll be a menu entry for it
2007-08-06T09:05:00.000Z	Flannel	john	once you install it, there should be a menu entry in administration
