2008-03-28T00:31:00.000Z	hexon	CJS3141	have you enabled restriced drivers yet?
2008-03-28T00:32:00.000Z	CJS3141	hexon	I guess I haven't because I haven't consciously done it. :-) How do you do that, and why is it necessary?
2008-03-28T00:33:00.000Z	hexon	CJS3141	System->Adminstartion-> Restricted Drivers Manager
2008-03-28T00:35:00.000Z	CJS3141	hexon	It says my nvidia driver is enabled, but doesn't give version numbers or anything like that.
2008-03-28T00:36:00.000Z	hexon	CJS3141	what graphics card are you using?
2008-03-28T00:37:00.000Z	CJS3141	hexon	 VGA compatible controller: nVidia Corporation NV5M64 [RIVA TNT2 Model 64/Model 64 Pro] (rev 15)
2008-03-28T00:38:00.000Z	hexon	CJS3141	what problems are you having with your card? are you strying to enable compiz?
2008-03-28T00:39:00.000Z	CJS3141	hexon	Compiz is the "visual effects" option, correct? That's what I'm trying to use.
2008-03-28T00:40:00.000Z	hexon	CJS3141	not necisarily. compiz does work alongside the existing visual effects, but it is a seperate package
2008-03-28T00:42:00.000Z	hexon	CJS3141	go to system>administration>Synaptic Package manager...then click in the right side of the screen and type nvidia
2008-03-28T00:43:00.000Z	hexon	CJS3141	or you can try sudo apt-get install nvidia_glx_legacy
2008-03-28T00:45:00.000Z	CJS3141	hexon	the nvidia legacy driver software is what I all ready have installed.
2008-03-28T00:45:00.000Z	hexon	CJS3141	then you have the videocard driver already installed for you current card.
2008-03-28T00:46:00.000Z	hexon	CJS3141	what does it tell you when you attempt to enable you effects?
2008-03-28T00:47:00.000Z	CJS3141	hexon	It says "desktop effects could not be enabled"
2008-03-28T00:48:00.000Z	hexon	CJS3141	it seems that your card isn't compatible with desktop effects http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=664172
2008-03-28T00:56:00.000Z	hexon	CJS3141	from the link that I sent you, it seems that none of the availble drivers support it. Even if they were able to, the card that you have would not function very will with the graphics
2008-03-28T00:57:00.000Z	CJS3141	hexon	That's what I would suspect. I don't think I'm going to pursue it any further, but thanks anyway for your tip dgjones.
