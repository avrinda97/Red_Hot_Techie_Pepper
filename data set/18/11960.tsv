2006-07-02T13:05:00.000Z	bulltitan		i have a script here that uses the command lndir but the terminal shows an error and something about the command not found
2006-07-02T13:05:00.000Z	bulltitan		is lndir same as ln?
2006-07-02T13:06:00.000Z	bulltitan		any help with this lndir thing?
2006-07-02T13:07:00.000Z	ic56	bulltitan	yes on lndir.  Ask more specifically.
2006-07-02T13:10:00.000Z	bulltitan	ic56	this is one of the lines inside pcsx emu "lndir -silent /usr/lib/games/psemu/lib  Plugin"
2006-07-02T13:14:00.000Z	ic56	bulltitan	that lndir is creating a directory tree under 'Plugin", that appears to contain the entire directory tree from /usr/lib/games/psemu/lib
2006-07-02T13:15:00.000Z	ic56	bulltitan	yea. lndir isn't in the default install. hang on...
2006-07-02T13:17:00.000Z	ic56	bulltitan	right... lndir used to ship with X11.  Apparetnlly it still does, at least in XF86 under Debian, but not in Ubuntu.
2006-07-02T13:18:00.000Z	ic56	bulltitan	yw!
2006-07-02T13:19:00.000Z	ic56	bulltitan	it's a simple utility.  You could whip up the basic functionality in a couple lines of bash code.
2006-07-02T13:29:00.000Z	ic56	bulltitan	still need an lndir?  I whipped one up...
2006-07-02T13:30:00.000Z	ic56	bulltitan	Ah!  Where did you find it?
2006-07-02T13:31:00.000Z	ic56	bulltitan	not important.
2006-07-02T13:31:00.000Z	ic56	bulltitan	I was just curious whether you went to the X repository or picked up a copy from an unverified source
2006-07-02T13:33:00.000Z	ic56	bulltitan	Ah. you never noticed where you got it from.  Was it an ubuntu package or a naked binary?
2006-07-02T13:33:00.000Z	ic56	bulltitan	not a .deb ?
2006-07-02T13:33:00.000Z	ic56	bulltitan	cool. good to know. thx
