2012-01-11T10:07:00.000Z	Shoogy		hey guys I got a quick question
2012-01-11T10:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Shoogy	ask away
2012-01-11T10:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Shoogy	install xfce4  and use that
2012-01-11T10:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Shoogy	you'll need to log off, select xfce then log on
2012-01-11T10:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Shoogy	no its a different desktop
2012-01-11T10:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Shoogy	in a terminal run:  sudo apt-get udpate; sudo apt-get install xfce4
2012-01-11T10:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Shoogy	there is also a way to mak Gnome3 look like Gnome2 here: http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2011/12/how-to-make-ubuntu-11-10-look-and-feel-like-gnome-2/
2012-01-11T10:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Shoogy	unity is a panel for Gnome, you are using Gnome now
2012-01-11T10:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Shoogy	you have gnome, its already "enabled"
2012-01-11T10:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Shoogy	did you try xfce?
2012-01-11T10:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Shoogy	looks and smells just like gnome2
2012-01-11T10:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Shoogy	Ubuntu lucid: http://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRa-6vSJgamDgmR3PZ5SAIEjIQqklNfIsJzbCLWit0Vnl3xoJ52tkmyB2DfeA    and Xubuntu Lucid: http://fc00.deviantart.net/fs70/i/2011/204/9/b/xubuntu_lucid_revisited_by_carteirodopoente-d41d55e.png     what's the difference....
2012-01-11T10:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Shoogy	then  use the guide and tweak it
2012-01-11T10:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Shoogy	its dead, the Gnome team are no longer developing it
2012-01-11T10:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Shoogy	10.10 has little over 3 months support left in it, you are wasting your time
2012-01-11T10:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Shoogy	after april you will get no more updates
2012-01-11T10:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Shoogy	Natty (11.04) has Gnome fallback in it
2012-01-11T10:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Shoogy	you are fighting a losing battle, eventually there will be NO ubuntu using Gnome2 and it will be pure Gnome3. There may be some settings in later releases but for the forseeable future that is the way Gnome desktop is going under Ubuntu
