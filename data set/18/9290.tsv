2007-04-22T06:30:00.000Z	stp2007		question. How long does the Ubuntu installation take from CD? If the answer is 40 minutes or so (on an admittedly older laptop) then everything is ok.
2007-04-22T06:32:00.000Z	randomwalker	stp2007	no way to know for sure, but if you 256 mb or mor eof memory its very likely less than half an hour
2007-04-22T06:34:00.000Z	stp2007	randomwalker	I have 256 meg and its been about 40 minutes with a lot of CD drive access. A new window (titled Install) opened up in the last 5 or 10 minutes but is empty. Just for clarity sake after booting from the Ubuntu CD I should click on the Installl icon right?
2007-04-22T06:35:00.000Z	randomwalker	stp2007	right
2007-04-22T06:35:00.000Z	stp2007	randomwalker	ok thanks. I guess its just going to take a while.
2007-04-22T06:35:00.000Z	randomwalker	stp2007	looks like there's a problem with either the CD or the memory
2007-04-22T06:39:00.000Z	stp2007	randomwalker	can you suggest a course of action? All I can think of is wait or reboot and try again.
2007-04-22T06:40:00.000Z	randomwalker	stp2007	describe exactly what happened after you clicked install. just a blank window?
2007-04-22T06:40:00.000Z	stp2007	randomwalker	lots of disk access and eventually a blank window. To be honest I can't remember because I was doing other things as well. I just rebooted and will try to reinstall again.
2007-04-22T06:41:00.000Z	randomwalker	stp2007	if you have 256 megs
2007-04-22T06:41:00.000Z	randomwalker	stp2007	you don't have enough memory to install and do lots of other things at the same time
2007-04-22T06:41:00.000Z	randomwalker	stp2007	so try not opening other programs other than the installer
2007-04-22T06:41:00.000Z	stp2007	randomwalker	I was doing the other stuff on my other laptop :)
2007-04-22T06:41:00.000Z	randomwalker	stp2007	oh. then try to see how much memory it's using
2007-04-22T06:42:00.000Z	stp2007	randomwalker	how can I determine that?
2007-04-22T06:42:00.000Z	randomwalker	stp2007	system->administratin->system monitor
2007-04-22T06:43:00.000Z	stp2007	randomwalker	ok will give that a try when able to. Might be a bit because I really didn't have mouse control (slow. etc)
2007-04-22T06:43:00.000Z	randomwalker	stp2007	yeah, sounds bad, probably best just reboot
