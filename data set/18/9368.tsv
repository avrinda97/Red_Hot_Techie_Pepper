2007-05-22T15:03:00.000Z	gcc_		hola all, i'm having some trouble with an ipod, anybody have time to walk a n00b through the problem?
2007-05-22T15:04:00.000Z	h3xis	gcc_	i dont have an ipod, but try asking your question
2007-05-22T15:07:00.000Z	gcc_	h3xis	wastedfluid, seen this before?
2007-05-22T15:07:00.000Z	h3xis	gcc_	seen what?
2007-05-22T15:08:00.000Z	gcc_	h3xis	my ipod mounts periodically at best, i don't get the icon when it does, and when it doesnt (the vast majority of the time) dmesg still detects but spits out a ton of i/o errors etc
2007-05-22T15:09:00.000Z	h3xis	gcc_	can you mount it manually though?
2007-05-22T15:09:00.000Z	h3xis	gcc_	i assume you can mount ipods :p
2007-05-22T15:10:00.000Z	gcc_	h3xis	i can type it, but it usually just sits there
2007-05-22T15:10:00.000Z	h3xis	gcc_	maybe your ipod is bad? :S
2007-05-22T15:11:00.000Z	gcc_	h3xis	quite possibly, but is there any way to tell for sure? i've been using it with Sabayon until i decided to switch to ubuntu, seemed to work as well as anything else did in sabayon...
2007-05-22T15:11:00.000Z	h3xis	gcc_	whyd you switch to ubuntu?
2007-05-22T15:12:00.000Z	gcc_	h3xis	parents wanted something a little more stable. i love sabayon- was a dev for a while- but they need something that inspires more polished than bleeding edge
2007-05-22T15:13:00.000Z	h3xis	gcc_	blasphemy.
2007-05-22T15:14:00.000Z	gcc_	h3xis	<shrugs> hey, ive got my parents using linux, im willing to hold off on source code for a few years ;)
2007-05-22T15:15:00.000Z	h3xis	gcc_	i really have no idea. the only time ive seen i/o errors has been from bad devices or a misconfigured system
2007-05-22T15:16:00.000Z	gcc_	h3xis	yeah... i dunno, i suppose its possible that its just screwing up, was hoping that it was something easy to fix. What i know about ipods on linux- besides how to plug them in- wouldnt fill a midget's thimble
2007-05-22T15:17:00.000Z	h3xis	gcc_	yeah, i dont have one; i just know you can mount them and use gtkpod :p
2007-05-22T15:17:00.000Z	gcc_	h3xis	ah well. thank you for your time
