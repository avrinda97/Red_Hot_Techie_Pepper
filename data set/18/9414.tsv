2007-10-04T16:37:00.000Z	jscinoz		Hey guys
2007-10-04T16:38:00.000Z	jscinoz		I was growing my home partition via gparted on the ubuntu live CD, for an unknown reason gparted exited halfway through, if i open it again it shows the file system at its original size but with no data and shows a little error Icon, what chance is there of recovering my data and how can i do this?

2008-02-15T16:29:00.000Z	ikonia	jscinoz	your language is uncalled for and not welcome
2008-02-15T16:31:00.000Z	ikonia	jscinoz	carry on using the language then,
2008-02-15T16:32:00.000Z	jscinoz	ikonia	thinks "xyz is pissing me off" is bad phrase
2008-02-15T16:37:00.000Z	ikonia	jscinoz	there is one, however the name escapes me
2008-02-15T16:37:00.000Z	ikonia	jscinoz	there is one that tests the card quite hard
2008-02-15T16:38:00.000Z	ikonia	jscinoz	I can't think of the name, I've never used it, trying to find it
2008-02-15T16:39:00.000Z	ikonia	jscinoz	this isn't what I was looking for, but may help http://globs.sourceforge.net/
2008-02-15T16:39:00.000Z	ikonia	jscinoz	thats not the one I'm thinking of
2008-02-15T16:45:00.000Z	jscinoz	ikonia	globs fails to build >_<
2008-02-15T16:45:00.000Z	ikonia	jscinoz	typical, I'm still looking for the one I actually meant
2008-02-15T16:49:00.000Z	jscinoz	ikonia	SPECviewperf?
2008-02-15T16:52:00.000Z	ikonia	jscinoz	nope, that wasn't it either
