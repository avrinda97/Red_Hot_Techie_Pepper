2007-08-25T11:03:00.000Z	christian_	wailer	Heh, where
2007-08-25T11:03:00.000Z	wailer		ten lines up or so
2007-08-25T11:05:00.000Z	wailer		christian: right click an icon - select stretch then with the mouse move it to the size you want
2007-08-25T11:09:00.000Z	wailer	christian_	any luck??
2007-08-25T11:09:00.000Z	christian_	wailer	No, will you explain for me?
2007-08-25T11:10:00.000Z	christian_	wailer	I've still not found that place.
2007-08-25T11:11:00.000Z	wailer	christian_	first off - I was talking about desktop icons & making them smaller - is that what you want?
2007-08-25T11:11:00.000Z	christian_	wailer	Oh, my fault. :p
2007-08-25T11:11:00.000Z	christian_	wailer	Yes, I want that. How?
2007-08-25T11:13:00.000Z	christian_	wailer	How do I make them smaller?
2007-08-25T11:13:00.000Z	wailer	christian_	I right click on my trash icon & a menu comes up - do you get that as well
2007-08-25T11:13:00.000Z	christian_	wailer	That trash icon in the corner? Yupp
2007-08-25T11:15:00.000Z	wailer		christian: in the corner probably means it is a panel object - what is the icon you want to make smaller - so I can be sure
2007-08-25T11:18:00.000Z	wailer		christian:??
2007-08-25T11:18:00.000Z	wailer		!panel
2007-08-25T11:21:00.000Z	wailer		christian: right click panel then select  - properties - then choose size to suit
2007-08-25T11:25:00.000Z	wailer	christian_	the panel is the same as the taskbar in windows
