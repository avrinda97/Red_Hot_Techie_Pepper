2010-06-14T09:22:00.000Z	gbear14275		is there a way to look at motherboard options through CLI?
2010-06-14T09:22:00.000Z	n2diy	gbear14275	lshw
2010-06-14T11:08:00.000Z	n2diy	gbear14275	sudo apt-get install iommu
2010-06-14T11:11:00.000Z	gbear14275	n2diy	yeah, thats not a package
2010-06-14T11:11:00.000Z	n2diy	gbear14275	what is it then?
2010-06-14T11:14:00.000Z	gbear14275	n2diy	its not in the boot bios menu... but I'm not sure that means anything to be honest
2010-06-14T11:14:00.000Z	gbear14275	n2diy	although I'm not sure... which is why I'm in here :(
2010-06-14T11:15:00.000Z	n2diy	gbear14275	I'm googling it now, looks like it lives o a virtual box?
2010-06-14T11:16:00.000Z	gbear14275	n2diy	this is more for KVM support than virtualbox but I'm sure it has relation there as well...  I think it goes to support hardware passthrough to VM's (which is why I'm interested in it)
2010-06-14T11:21:00.000Z	n2diy	gbear14275	sorry, don't see anything that helps, if you google Ubuntu iommu, maybe you will find what you need?
2010-06-14T11:21:00.000Z	gbear14275	n2diy	been doing it all night :-?

2010-06-14T11:22:00.000Z	gbear14275	n2diy	thanks for looking though man!
2010-06-14T11:23:00.000Z	n2diy	gbear14275	np, I was curious, having never heard of it.
2010-06-14T11:23:00.000Z	gbear14275	n2diy	I got there after reading this howto: http://www.linux-kvm.org/page/How_to_assign_devices_with_VT-d_in_KVM
2010-06-14T11:24:00.000Z	gbear14275	n2diy	so was trying to figure out if I had VT-d support
2010-06-14T11:25:00.000Z	n2diy	gbear14275	roger that, got to take a break, I'll take a look at it in a couple.
2010-06-14T11:44:00.000Z	n2diy	gbear14275	if you followed the directons on that web page, I don't have a clue what else you can do?
