2006-07-11T13:38:00.000Z	CompuCh|p		Can anyone recommend a good backup program? I want to make a backup of all my files (>4 GB) everyday to a FAT32 share over the network. So I'd like something differential that can handle >4GB files on FAT32 (I tried backup2l but that didn't work out)
2006-07-11T13:39:00.000Z	CompuCh|p		bbrazil; ok, then is there a backup program that will split my backups over smaller files?
2006-07-11T13:40:00.000Z	CompuCh|p		Bye GStubbs43
2006-07-11T13:41:00.000Z	narfmaster	CompuCh|p	have you thought about setting up an ftpd for backups?
2006-07-11T13:41:00.000Z	CompuCh|p		narfmaster; where?
2006-07-11T13:42:00.000Z	CompuCh|p		and how would that matter?
2006-07-11T13:42:00.000Z	narfmaster	CompuCh|p	where you are going to store the files
2006-07-11T13:43:00.000Z	CompuCh|p	narfmaster	I wanted to put them on a LAN share on a Windows computer (laptop)
2006-07-11T13:43:00.000Z	narfmaster		CompuChip, you wouldn't have to worry about whether the file system was NTFS or ext3 if you had an ftpd
2006-07-11T13:44:00.000Z	CompuCh|p		I got the impression that the 4GB limit is a FAT limitation, not a Samba one or something like that
2006-07-11T13:44:00.000Z	narfmaster	CompuCh|p	yes i think that is true
2006-07-11T13:45:00.000Z	CompuCh|p		I could make multiple backups, that is: run the backup program first on /home, then on /data, etc
2006-07-11T13:47:00.000Z	narfmaster		well, i use ftpd for making backups and transferring files so that's what i suggest
2006-07-11T13:47:00.000Z	CompuCh|p		or in Google :S
2006-07-11T13:48:00.000Z	CompuCh|p	narfmaster	I don't really feel like installing an ftp server on each computer I might want to backup to
2006-07-11T13:48:00.000Z	narfmaster	CompuCh|p	why not? sounds reasonable to me
2006-07-11T13:48:00.000Z	CompuCh|p	narfmaster	because Windows doesn't just do apt-get install ftpd
