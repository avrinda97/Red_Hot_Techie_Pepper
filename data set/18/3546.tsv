2009-10-11T04:08:00.000Z	ReggyLove		by default no ports are closed in ubuntu right ?
2009-10-11T04:09:00.000Z	mo0nykit	ReggyLove	I would think that all unused ports in Ubuntu are closed.
2009-10-11T04:10:00.000Z	mo0nykit	ReggyLove	IMHO if you install a daemon or server, I think that's when the corresponding port is opened
2009-10-11T04:11:00.000Z	mo0nykit	ReggyLove	How do you know they are closed? It's probably related to port forwarding on your router
2009-10-11T04:13:00.000Z	mo0nykit	ReggyLove	try running Transmission, then do a "netstat -4" (-4 if you're using ipv4)

2009-10-11T04:16:00.000Z	mo0nykit	ReggyLove	sorry I forgot "netstat -4n" (-n so that ports will be shown as numbers)

2009-10-11T04:20:00.000Z	mo0nykit	ReggyLove	In your local address column, look for the port number you opened in Transmission. You can do it with "netstat -4n | grep <port number>"
2009-10-11T04:21:00.000Z	ReggyLove	mo0nykit	no output
2009-10-11T04:21:00.000Z	mo0nykit	ReggyLove	are you running Transmission already? Like activating a torrent?
2009-10-11T04:21:00.000Z	ReggyLove	mo0nykit	yes
2009-10-11T04:23:00.000Z	mo0nykit	ReggyLove	just to be sure if you followed correctly. If the port you want to open is 12345, your command should look like "netstat -4n | grep 12345"
2009-10-11T04:23:00.000Z	ReggyLove	mo0nykit	i got it right
2009-10-11T04:23:00.000Z	ReggyLove	mo0nykit	netstat -4n | grep 50001
2009-10-11T04:24:00.000Z	mo0nykit	ReggyLove	It could be a firewall problem (iptables, and the like). I'm sorry I couldn't help any further...
2009-10-11T04:24:00.000Z	ReggyLove	mo0nykit	ok thanks
2009-10-11T04:26:00.000Z	mo0nykit	ReggyLove	you could also look into AppArmor. I haven't tinkered with that, but it could be related
