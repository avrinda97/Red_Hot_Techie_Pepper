2006-03-14T14:58:00.000Z	mrwhoopie		i'm a newbie...     wondering how to get permissions to read/write to dev/hda1...       ????
2006-03-14T14:59:00.000Z	mrwhoopie		it's my hard drive on my laptop
2006-03-14T15:00:00.000Z	mrwhoopie		what i'm trying to do is write osx to my HD
2006-03-14T15:02:00.000Z	mrwhoopie		ie   i want to use the command dd if-tiger-x86-flat.img of=/dev/hda
2006-03-14T15:02:00.000Z	mrwhoopie		but it won't let me
2006-03-14T15:03:00.000Z	MrRio	mrwhoopie	hey, are you running from ubuntu livecd?
2006-03-14T15:04:00.000Z	MrRio	mrwhoopie	use livecd, have your tiger image on a networkshare
2006-03-14T15:04:00.000Z	MrRio	mrwhoopie	sudo <command>
2006-03-14T15:04:00.000Z	MrRio	mrwhoopie	yeah u can
2006-03-14T15:06:00.000Z	MrRio	mrwhoopie	what i recommend is you leave a part your harddrive with no partition
2006-03-14T15:07:00.000Z	MrRio	mrwhoopie	on your laptop drive
2006-03-14T15:08:00.000Z	MrRio	mrwhoopie	yeah, you can get its name using a graphical tool like gparted
2006-03-14T15:08:00.000Z	MrRio	mrwhoopie	apt-get install gparted
2006-03-14T15:10:00.000Z	MrRio	mrwhoopie	you need to use sudo for these admin tasks
2006-03-14T15:11:00.000Z	MrRio	mrwhoopie	not quite, linux and apple need root priveledges to install software and do admin tasks, you dont (by default) log in a root, but simply elevate to those privs when you need to
2006-03-14T15:12:00.000Z	MrRio	mrwhoopie	yeah, then read the osx86 material about setting up grub
