2011-01-25T14:15:00.000Z	Mehrzad		aargh, is smelling like a burning gpu
2011-01-25T14:15:00.000Z	Mehrzad		4870 ati
2011-01-25T14:17:00.000Z	Mehrzad		switched to windows, is getting cool now
2011-01-25T14:18:00.000Z	Mehrzad		i haven't installed the proprietary drivers yet, maybe that's beacouse of it razz1?
2011-01-25T14:19:00.000Z	Mehrzad		& I'm searching for an underclocker
2011-01-25T14:21:00.000Z	razz1	Mehrzad	is it a lappy?
2011-01-25T14:22:00.000Z	Mehrzad	razz1	lappy?
2011-01-25T14:22:00.000Z	razz1	Mehrzad	laptop?
2011-01-25T14:22:00.000Z	Mehrzad	razz1	ah, no
2011-01-25T14:23:00.000Z	Mehrzad	razz1	it's good when underclocking under windows
2011-01-25T14:24:00.000Z	razz1	Mehrzad	thats pretty bad for a desktop? nothing beats windows for video acceleration, bar vdpau
2011-01-25T14:27:00.000Z	Mehrzad	razz1	dunno what it really is, the gpu runs crysis smooth when underclocking and doesn't overheat
2011-01-25T14:28:00.000Z	razz1	Mehrzad	what are the temp under windows
2011-01-25T14:29:00.000Z	Mehrzad	razz1	from 50 (only windows) to ... (right now, after a overheating in ubuntu is 73)
2011-01-25T14:29:00.000Z	Mehrzad		*from 60
2011-01-25T14:31:00.000Z	razz1	Mehrzad	50 is alright 75+ not so good, try cooling options, like adding a fan to GPU, sorry cannot help
2011-01-25T14:33:00.000Z	Mehrzad	razz1	58 now. okay, maybe it'll make it alright. but i don't see any problem with windows (maybe there's but i don't see), it's only ubuntu
2011-01-25T14:35:00.000Z	razz1	Mehrzad	it should be alright under ubuntu if you dont run any GPU intensive tasks, i guess
