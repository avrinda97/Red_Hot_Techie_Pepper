2010-07-26T21:59:00.000Z	crux000		Hi folks.
2010-07-26T21:59:00.000Z	crux000		Anyone know how the boot CD decides what its /etc/fstab should look like?

2010-07-26T21:59:00.000Z	Docteh	crux000	does it even need one?
2010-07-26T21:59:00.000Z	crux000	Docteh	It apparently creates one that contains two of my hard drives as swap. :(
2010-07-26T22:06:00.000Z	Docteh	crux000	i thought swap was detected by looking at the partition types
2010-07-26T22:08:00.000Z	crux000	Docteh	It is, although I'd think that the LiveCD wouldn't touch it even if it found some.
2010-07-26T22:09:00.000Z	crux000	Docteh	The udev log shows the partitions coming up as "linux_raid_member" just fine
2010-07-26T22:11:00.000Z	crux000	Docteh	two of the partitions from the array
2010-07-26T22:12:00.000Z	crux000	Docteh	MD device wasn't picked up automatically
2010-07-26T22:14:00.000Z	Docteh	crux000	make a partition on some drive (any spares?) thats marked raid memer then mkswap it and then boot that, might be the swap finder isn't looking at file system types
2010-07-26T22:14:00.000Z	crux000	Docteh	there's two other drives in the array, exactly identical, that never get picked up as swap for some reason.
2010-07-26T22:15:00.000Z	crux000	Docteh	... what's this "swapfinder"? does it leave a log I can read?
2010-07-26T22:15:00.000Z	Docteh	crux000	with raid you can have the meta data at differen places
2010-07-26T22:15:00.000Z	crux000	Docteh	at this point it's completely trashed raid :) (thanks, boot cd!)
2010-07-26T22:16:00.000Z	Docteh	crux000	i don't know where it is, but if you can give them a test case they can fix it
2010-07-26T22:27:00.000Z	crux000	Docteh	thanks for recommending to snag the first 1m off each drive
2010-07-26T22:41:00.000Z	crux000	Docteh	if you were interested, I just posted tarballs of a bunch of logs and stuff on: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/607006
