2005-01-08T12:53:00.000Z	ogra	vincent__	broken in which way ?
2005-01-08T12:53:00.000Z	vincent__	ogra	I just reinstalled it with ubuntu-desktop
2005-01-08T12:53:00.000Z	ogra	vincent__	have you looked if there is already one thats stuck ?
2005-01-08T12:54:00.000Z	vincent__	ogra	when I kill them all, one is re-appearing on his own one sec after
2005-01-08T12:54:00.000Z	ogra	vincent__	do you have any nfs or samba mounts ?
2005-01-08T12:55:00.000Z	vincent__	ogra	no
2005-01-08T12:55:00.000Z	ogra	vincent__	hmm, i know this behavior only from stuck network mounts.....
2005-01-08T12:55:00.000Z	ogra	vincent__	probably a stuck cdrom ?
2005-01-08T12:58:00.000Z	ogra	vincent__	i'm pretty sure something in your filesystem is stuck.....normally a unmaount of the device/network mount with option -l helps here, but if you dont have any .....
2005-01-08T13:00:00.000Z	ogra	vincent__	we could start to randomly shoot processes or you do a reboot ....
2005-01-08T13:01:00.000Z	vincent__	ogra	I'm gonna try a reboot as I reinstalled
