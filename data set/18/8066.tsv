2009-03-22T04:13:00.000Z	scunizi		What does ubuntu have like Picasa's ability to create a CSS driven photo album.. I've got some shots I'd like to throw up on some spare web space and don't want to mess with CMS
2009-03-22T04:14:00.000Z	militant	scunizi	 gallery2 is pretty awesome (though complex)
2009-03-22T04:14:00.000Z	scunizi	militant	I was looking at that but you need to be running your own server right? or have it on a linux based server?
2009-03-22T04:15:00.000Z	militant	scunizi	  you asked what ubuntu has.  so yes.  linux server.  but it doesn't have to be your own.  a lot of admins like gallery and might even be running it already
2009-03-22T04:16:00.000Z	scunizi	militant	this is a unique situation.. just personal web space provided by my isp (10gigs) to throw individual pages up.. I think it's on a windows server.  Picasa will build a nice css driven page to display a folder of pics.. simple stuff
2009-03-22T04:17:00.000Z	militant	scunizi	 ok, and picasa exists for linux, and windows.  so there you go, i think?
2009-03-22T04:17:00.000Z	scunizi	militant	yea.. I was resisting.. gwenview will do it but it pulls in a boat load of kde dependancies.
2009-03-22T04:18:00.000Z	militant	scunizi	 also there are a few simple gallery/thumb generator scripts for linux that will make a dir you can zip up and sned over to that server
2009-03-22T04:18:00.000Z	scunizi	militant	you've got my interest
2009-03-22T04:19:00.000Z	militant		lemme check for a couple, i was playing with some last night til i settled on gallery2 (for its rich featureset and being able to add pics on the fly)
2009-03-22T04:19:00.000Z	scunizi		k
2009-03-22T04:19:00.000Z	militant		photon, webmagick, and lazygal had reasonable results
2009-03-22T04:20:00.000Z	scunizi	militant	all in repos?
2009-03-22T04:20:00.000Z	militant	scunizi	 sure are, they come right up on an apt-cache search gallery
2009-03-22T04:21:00.000Z	scunizi	militant	thanks.. probably just what I was looking for.. simple direct ..one off type stuff.  thanks!
2009-03-22T04:21:00.000Z	militant		yep.  i do believe webmagick was the one that i could just specify a directory full of pics and a thumbnail size, and it made the thumbs, generated the page, and put it all in an easy to deploy package
2009-03-22T04:22:00.000Z	scunizi	militant	that's what I'm looking for
2009-03-22T04:23:00.000Z	scunizi	militant	is webmagick gui or cli?
