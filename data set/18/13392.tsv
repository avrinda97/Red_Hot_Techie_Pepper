2006-12-03T11:33:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	cnc	what about mice?
2006-12-03T11:41:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	cnc	i have no idea. make a post in the forums, and perhaps file a bugreport on launchpad. also, try out dapper, if you are on edgy now
2006-12-03T11:58:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	cnc	then file a bug on lauchpad
2006-12-03T12:04:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	cnc	again, have you filed a bug against this?
2006-12-03T12:06:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	cnc	https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/
2006-12-03T12:08:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	cnc	get the live cd for edgy (6.10) and see if it works. still, file a bug on lauchpad agains dapper.
2006-12-03T12:09:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	cnc	and why wouldnt that run on edgy?
