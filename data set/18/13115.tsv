2006-03-11T14:44:00.000Z	corhere		I have a computer which I would like to have beep (echo -e '\a') when it finishes booting (reaching the login prompt). How can I do this?
2006-03-11T14:45:00.000Z	LjL	corhere	create a script in /etc/init.d that beeps, and register it with the lowest priority using update-rc.d, i guess
2006-03-11T14:46:00.000Z	corhere	LjL	thank you
2006-03-11T15:09:00.000Z	LjL	corhere	just create one. in theory, it should respond to a "start", a "stop" and a "restart" argument, but i don't think you'll be killed if it doesn't.
2006-03-11T15:09:00.000Z	LjL	corhere	so,   #/bin/sh        [newline]        echo -e "\a"
2006-03-11T15:10:00.000Z	LjL	corhere	that's #!/bin/sh
2006-03-11T15:10:00.000Z	corhere	LjL	thanks for the help
2006-03-11T15:11:00.000Z	LjL	corhere	you could even just add the beeping to /etc/initd/miscboot.sh, not sure if that's actually run last though
2006-03-11T15:11:00.000Z	corhere	LjL	I'll check that
2006-03-11T15:16:00.000Z	LjL	corhere	uh, it's 55 for me
2006-03-11T15:16:00.000Z	LjL	corhere	anyway just create your own. it's a piece of cake
2006-03-11T15:17:00.000Z	LjL	corhere	then "update-rc.d yourscript 1 1" ought to work
2006-03-11T15:18:00.000Z	corhere	LjL	i just added the beeps to the end of /etc/init.d/rcS
2006-03-11T15:18:00.000Z	LjL	corhere	that sounds horrible.
2006-03-11T15:19:00.000Z	corhere	LjL	it should work, always beeping at the end of the boot-up, but not whenever a runlevel changes
2006-03-11T15:20:00.000Z	LjL	corhere	well, for one, i think anytime you dist-upgrade and there is a new version of that file, your custom one will be overwritten (probably without warning, as i don't think it's considered a config file)
2006-03-11T15:20:00.000Z	corhere	LjL	that file does not really change between dists and it is an easy fix if/when it does happen
2006-03-11T15:22:00.000Z	LjL	corhere	oh well... anyway doing it "the right way" is only very slightly more complicated in my opinion. if you don't want beeps on runlevel changes, then update-rc.d has an extensive syntax for deciding what happens at what runlevel
