2005-08-07T06:17:00.000Z	ColonelKernel		new distro, good distro, great support community
2005-08-07T06:17:00.000Z	ColonelKernel		I havent seen any of the ops in here go nuts '
2005-08-07T06:18:00.000Z	ColonelKernel		cant say the same for  #fedora and #debian
2005-08-07T06:18:00.000Z	ColonelKernel		debians a great distro with a very nasty channel
2005-08-07T06:18:00.000Z	ColonelKernel		fedora is a weak distro with a nasty support channel
2005-08-07T06:19:00.000Z	windex	ColonelKernel	debian people are just bitter from all the bad press recently. :)
2005-08-12T06:24:00.000Z	windex	ColonelKernel	erm. you should be able to build a kernel from the kernel source that works with ubuntu. just make sure you enable things for your hardware, hotplug support for hotplug, etc.
2005-08-12T06:25:00.000Z	ColonelKernel	windex	nah, device-mapper doesnt work when you do that, theres ubuntu-specific patches somewhere
2005-08-12T06:26:00.000Z	windex	ColonelKernel	hrm. uh, those are redhat supplied patches.
2005-08-12T06:26:00.000Z	ColonelKernel	windex	thats odd, vanilla kernels work fine on fedora
2005-08-12T06:26:00.000Z	windex	ColonelKernel	http://sources.redhat.com/dm/
2005-08-12T06:27:00.000Z	windex	ColonelKernel	does fedora use device mapper? :P
2005-08-12T06:27:00.000Z	ColonelKernel	windex	I do not beleive so.
2005-08-12T06:27:00.000Z	windex	ColonelKernel	that'd explain why. i know centos uses device-mapper, and it's based on RHEL. i (think) i used those patches.
2005-08-12T06:28:00.000Z	windex	ColonelKernel	does that help you in your quest to enjoy ubuntu slightly more? :P
2005-08-12T06:28:00.000Z	ColonelKernel	windex	i will have to try those out on the latest vanilla and see what happens
2005-08-12T06:29:00.000Z	windex	ColonelKernel	according to redhat, btw, kernels 2.6 integrate device mapper
2005-08-12T06:29:00.000Z	windex	ColonelKernel	it's in the logical volume management config.
