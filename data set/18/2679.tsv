2010-05-14T00:54:00.000Z	sebsebseb	fredfall	Chromium is open source,  where as Chrome is closed source and based on it
2010-05-14T00:54:00.000Z	sebsebseb	fredfall	not that much
2010-05-14T00:54:00.000Z	fredfall	sebsebseb	What would you prefer?
2010-05-14T00:55:00.000Z	sebsebseb	fredfall	personally I don't like Chromium or Chrome much, since  Mozilla Firefox :)   however out of the two I would much rather use Chromeium than Chrome
2010-05-14T00:55:00.000Z	fredfall	sebsebseb	OK
2010-05-14T00:55:00.000Z	fredfall	sebsebseb	What do you use?
2010-05-14T00:56:00.000Z	sebsebseb	fredfall	Firerfox mainly, but sometimes other browsers even such as Konqueror   and sometimes even Epiphany or Galeon
2010-05-14T00:57:00.000Z	sebsebseb	fredfall	Firefox is a great one to support for various reasons :)
