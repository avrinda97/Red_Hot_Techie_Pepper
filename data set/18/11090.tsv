2006-09-19T14:10:00.000Z	inglor		hey, my shitty ISP won't let me access IRC, any way around it? it's only at work, I have another box at home running windows on another ISP
2006-09-19T14:10:00.000Z	inglor		this is my laptop by the way
2006-09-19T14:11:00.000Z	inglor		sorry
2006-09-19T14:11:00.000Z	inglor		I think so, I can use ssh probably
2006-09-19T14:12:00.000Z	inglor		second question, I installed hebrew support, it worked before but stopped working when I got XGL it stopped working in gnome (still working in KDE), is there any way to fix that?
2006-09-19T14:12:00.000Z	inglor		it's not XGL related, it's language support related
2006-09-19T14:13:00.000Z	inglor		I need to get alt+shift to switch languages again
2006-09-19T14:15:00.000Z	inglor		ok, anyone, how do I change the shortcut that changes languages, or at least get an icon up that lets you choose
2006-09-19T14:15:00.000Z	inglor		!languages
2006-09-19T14:15:00.000Z	inglor		!language support
2006-09-19T14:16:00.000Z	bruenig	inglor	what is the language changing shortcut you speak of
2006-09-19T14:17:00.000Z	inglor	bruenig	I need alt+shift to change languages like it used to
2006-09-19T14:17:00.000Z	bruenig	inglor	how did you get alt+shift to change languages in the first place?
2006-09-19T14:17:00.000Z	inglor	bruenig	it was default
2006-09-19T14:17:00.000Z	bruenig	inglor	what was the commad that shortcut executed
2006-09-19T14:18:00.000Z	inglor	bruenig	no idea, it was default
2006-09-19T14:18:00.000Z	bruenig	inglor	that is a problem, until you can figure the command out, it will be hard to figure out how to recover it
2006-09-19T14:19:00.000Z	inglor	bruenig	yes, I can get hebrew when I change my default layout to hebrew and move it to first in keyboard prefrences
