2005-01-15T09:00:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB		If you wish to disable the web configurator for security reasons, you can do so with "dldrconfig --webconf=off". To re-enable it, use "dldrconfig --webconf=127.0.0.1:18020".
2005-01-15T09:00:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB		sorry apste
2005-01-15T09:00:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB		but it doesn't look like you HAVE to use the web based interface
2005-01-15T09:02:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB		I don't need a browser for ndiswrapper
2005-01-15T09:04:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB		it's still a web interface
2005-01-15T09:05:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB		precisely
2005-01-15T09:06:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB		it doesn't make it not retarded though
2005-01-15T09:07:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB		all programs that require the root password are retarded
2005-01-15T09:08:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB		programs that NOT ONLY require the root password, but also require a web interface for configuration are double retarded
2005-01-15T09:09:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	HrdwrBoB	CUPS requires that in its original configuration. (Though Ubuntu disables that.)
2005-01-15T09:09:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	MobyTurbo	it doesn't require it
2005-01-15T09:09:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	MobyTurbo	it offers it
2005-01-15T09:09:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	MobyTurbo	apparently driverloader is ONLY configurable from the web interface
2005-01-15T09:10:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	HrdwrBoB	what is driverloader?
2005-01-15T09:11:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	MobyTurbo	commercial ndiswrapper
2005-01-15T09:12:00.000Z	MobyTurbo	HrdwrBoB	ndiswrapper, isn't that something to do with running win-hardware using its windows dlls?
2005-01-15T09:13:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	MobyTurbo	sort of, essentially it's a windows network driver wrapper, mostly for wireless cards with no linux drivers
