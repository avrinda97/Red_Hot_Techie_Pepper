2006-01-09T17:22:00.000Z	fractas		seveas, i need to know how to install kylix 2 open edition on ubuntu, because they came on rpm version
2006-01-09T17:22:00.000Z	fractas		and don't work after the installation
2006-01-09T17:22:00.000Z	fractas		i don't have the source
2006-01-09T17:22:00.000Z	fractas		so i cannot compile it
2006-01-09T17:23:00.000Z	fractas		there is a way to transform a rpm into a deb package?
2006-01-09T17:23:00.000Z	Seveas	fractas	yes, but it's not guaranteed to work
2006-01-09T17:20:00.000Z	Seveas	fractas	asking specific questions is better
2006-01-09T17:21:00.000Z	Seveas	fractas	well, like the things you need to know...
2006-01-09T17:22:00.000Z	Seveas	fractas	rpms are bad, better get the source and compile it
2006-01-09T17:22:00.000Z	Seveas	fractas	then get it...
2006-01-09T17:24:00.000Z	fractas	Seveas	sorry for the trouble
2006-01-09T17:25:00.000Z	Seveas	fractas	kylix does not support Ubuntu, Ubuntu does not support kylix, You might need red hat for it to be supportd
2006-01-09T17:26:00.000Z	Seveas	fractas	you may have luck with alien (converting rpm to deb)
2006-01-09T17:31:00.000Z	Seveas	fractas	no, I only have ET...
2006-01-09T17:31:00.000Z	Seveas	fractas	apt-get install alien
