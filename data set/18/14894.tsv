2005-06-12T12:26:00.000Z	Arrogant		Hey, how do I make Ubuntu run something at startup?
2005-06-12T12:27:00.000Z	Arrogant		Thanks.
2005-06-12T05:34:00.000Z	Arrogant		Hey, is there any way to get more consoles on Ctrl+Alt+F#?
2005-06-12T05:34:00.000Z	Arrogant		Right now only 2 and 3 have consoles on them.
2005-06-12T05:35:00.000Z	Arrogant		1 is the install screen, 4 5 and 6 are blank
2005-06-12T05:35:00.000Z	Arrogant		7 is gnome
2005-06-12T05:35:00.000Z	Arrogant		8 9 10 11 12 are nothing at all
2005-06-12T05:37:00.000Z	HappyFool	Arrogant	does 'screen' work in terminals 2 / 3? easy way to get multiplexed terminals
2005-06-12T05:39:00.000Z	Arrogant	HappyFool	I don't know how to use screen
2005-06-12T05:40:00.000Z	HappyFool	Arrogant	it's pretty easy. Control-a c  to create a new "terminal" Control-a n to go to the "next" terminal
2005-06-12T05:41:00.000Z	Arrogant	HappyFool	That's pretty awesome
2005-06-12T05:42:00.000Z	HappyFool	Arrogant	screen is super-cool ;)
2005-06-12T05:42:00.000Z	HappyFool	Arrogant	oh, and Control-a ? for help
2005-06-12T05:42:00.000Z	HappyFool	Arrogant	probably most important combination to remember ;)
2005-06-12T05:44:00.000Z	Arrogant	HappyFool	screen is good to know because my computer is a piece of shit, and console is the only thing that runs smoothly
2005-06-12T05:45:00.000Z	HappyFool	Arrogant	screen is also very useful for ssh
2005-06-12T05:47:00.000Z	HappyFool	Arrogant	try fg
2005-06-12T05:48:00.000Z	HappyFool	Arrogant	fg is to 'foreground' a process, not kill it
