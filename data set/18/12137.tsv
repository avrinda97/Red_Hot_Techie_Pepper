2006-05-27T16:37:00.000Z	reiki		VMWare workstation 5.5 is what I use and it was about $100(USD) with education discount (I work at a university)
2006-05-27T16:38:00.000Z	reiki		you want to CREATE VMs you can't do that with player
2006-05-27T16:38:00.000Z	T`	reiki	are you kidding?
2006-05-27T16:38:00.000Z	T`	reiki	there are many tutorials all over the place showing how to do that

2006-05-27T16:39:00.000Z	T`	reiki	i think workstation is nice for pro users. who like snapshots, copy-on0write, etc..

2006-05-27T16:45:00.000Z	T`	reiki	i had this scanner whcih had no linux drivers. so i used to use it in windows VM ;)
2006-05-27T16:48:00.000Z	T`	reiki	ooh.. i knw someone who uses such a machine.. but i think its because he doesn;t breath enough oxygen while sleeping, so he feels tired in the morning
2006-05-27T16:48:00.000Z	T`	reiki	so the machine i think puts more oxygen or something like that into the air he breathes..
