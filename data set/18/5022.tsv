2009-01-09T22:03:00.000Z	wolter		my webcam is not working.
2009-01-09T22:05:00.000Z	wolter		i need to fix my webcam!
2009-01-09T22:06:00.000Z	wolter		?
2009-01-09T22:07:00.000Z	Seveas	wolter	and type 'dmesg' to see if the computer sees it (search for v4l)
2009-01-09T22:07:00.000Z	Seveas	wolter	and make sure there's no usb hub between the webcam and the computer
2009-01-09T22:08:00.000Z	wolter	Seveas	well, it is built-in, if that is what you mean...
2009-01-09T22:09:00.000Z	Seveas	wolter	well, can't get much closer then :)
2009-01-09T22:09:00.000Z	wolter	Seveas	indeed.
2009-01-09T22:09:00.000Z	Seveas	wolter	the lsusb command should be able to tell you the make and model. The lsmod command should list v4l or v4l2 if the camera is recognized
2009-01-09T22:11:00.000Z	wolter	Seveas	isn't lsusb for usb devices?
2009-01-09T22:11:00.000Z	Seveas	wolter	correct. Even though the camera is internal, it is almost certainly connected via the usb bus
2009-01-09T22:12:00.000Z	wolter	Seveas	i get a lot of linux foundation root hubs
2009-01-09T22:12:00.000Z	wolter	Seveas	besides that, i get the fingerprint reader, and an omnivision technologies thing
2009-01-09T22:13:00.000Z	Seveas	wolter	the omnivision is probably your webcam. Did lsmod show you something with v4l?
2009-01-09T22:16:00.000Z	wolter	Seveas	yes it does! i get a v4l1
2009-01-09T22:16:00.000Z	wolter	Seveas	and a lot of other stuf... some contain uvcvideo
2009-01-09T22:23:00.000Z	wolter	Seveas	when I do the sudo modprobe gspca, i get a fatal error...
