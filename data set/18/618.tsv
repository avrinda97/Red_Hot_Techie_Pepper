2012-02-22T00:05:00.000Z	Scott_S	danik	Are you trying to terminate the screens along with their process, or just the screen itself?
2012-02-22T00:09:00.000Z	Scott_S	danik	typing 'screen -list' should bring up a list of the screens along with their PID. Attach to the screen with 'screen -x', then press 'CTRL+A+K'
2012-02-22T00:10:00.000Z	Scott_S	danik	You're welcome.
2012-02-22T00:10:00.000Z	Scott_S	danik	You can also kill the process with 'kill [PID]', which will terminate both the process and the screen. This is a last resort though and is not recommended in any way.
2012-02-22T00:11:00.000Z	Scott_S	danik	CTRL+A+K is to kill the screen. CTRL+A+D is to detach from the screen.
2012-02-22T00:12:00.000Z	Scott_S	danik	The PID is the first number on the screen's name, on that one, it's 28187. I would not suggest killing the process unless it's absolutely necessary.
2012-02-22T00:13:00.000Z	Scott_S	danik	Send it anytime.
2012-02-22T00:16:00.000Z	Scott_S	danik	screen -r 28187.pts-0.vmd1626
2012-02-22T00:18:00.000Z	Scott_S	danik	Oneee moment here.
2012-02-22T00:20:00.000Z	Scott_S	danik	I don't know what to tell you, I would prefer not to just tell you to kill the processes, as you should be able to reattach to them...
2012-02-22T00:20:00.000Z	Scott_S	danik	Could you try just doing 'screen -r' with no extra paramaters? See if you connect to any of them?
2012-02-22T00:22:00.000Z	Scott_S	danik	Killing the processes will not damage screen. It will simply quit the screen like you were trying to do before.
2012-02-22T00:22:00.000Z	Scott_S	danik	Killing the screen would terminate the process anyways, they're pretty much the same.
2012-02-22T00:24:00.000Z	Scott_S	danik	Screens, if I recall, are private to the user they were started on. So, if you started screen on 'userA', 'userB' will not be able to view the screen.
2012-02-22T00:26:00.000Z	Scott_S	danik	You would have to start the screens again to regain access to them. Once the process is killed, the screen is gone too.
2012-02-22T00:27:00.000Z	Scott_S	danik	That's very odd. You should be able to just connect to them by typing 'screen -r [startOfName]', so I'm not sure why they wouldn't be working.
2012-02-22T00:40:00.000Z	Scott_S	danik	Good to hear, come back if you have any more issues.
