2008-02-10T02:05:00.000Z	arnath		ok...something weird just happened, i was happily typing along in pidgin, and suddenly my screen goes black, and when it turns back on, i'm on the login screen
2008-02-10T02:05:00.000Z	arnath		(and no i did not hit ctrl+alt+backspace by accident)
2008-02-10T02:06:00.000Z	arnath		can i look up the reason for the x dying?
2008-02-10T02:06:00.000Z	arnath		(ie: where is the log for this?)
2008-02-10T02:07:00.000Z	danand_	arnath	- look in /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2008-02-10T02:07:00.000Z	arnath	danand_	hmm, it's a bit long, anything i can grep for?
2008-02-10T02:08:00.000Z	danand_	arnath	- cat /var/log/Xorg.0.log | grep EE
2008-02-10T02:08:00.000Z	danand_	arnath	- cat /var/log/Xorg.0.log | grep WW
2008-02-10T02:09:00.000Z	arnath	danand_	nothing really :s
2008-02-10T02:09:00.000Z	arnath	danand_	is an X-crash in general something i should be worried about?
2008-02-10T02:10:00.000Z	danand_	arnath	- depends, does it keep crashing?
2008-02-10T02:10:00.000Z	arnath	danand_	nope, just the once
2008-02-10T02:10:00.000Z	arnath	danand_	(so far anyway)
2008-02-10T02:11:00.000Z	arnath	danand_	from time to time compiz seems to crash though (only on this computer, which was upgraded from a beta version of gutsy, my other computer doesn't have that problem)
2008-02-10T02:11:00.000Z	danand_	arnath	- shouldn't worry too much then - lets hope you don't keep crashing ;)
2008-02-10T02:11:00.000Z	arnath	danand_	ok :)
2008-02-10T02:12:00.000Z	danand_	arnath	- you could try looking in old logs if your worried ie Xorg.0.log.old
2008-02-10T02:12:00.000Z	arnath	danand_	ah :)
