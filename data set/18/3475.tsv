2012-10-29T21:00:00.000Z	ChogyDan	bazhang	I read that page, and I couldn't figure it out, hence why I am asking here.  The page is focuses on a specific package or process, but it happens during boot, so I don't know the package or process
2012-10-29T21:01:00.000Z	bazhang	ChogyDan	whats the bug you say you found then
2012-10-29T21:03:00.000Z	ChogyDan	bazhang	the boot pauses if I have a drive disconnected.  There is a prompt asking to skip mounting the drive, but that prompt disappears if you exit the splash screen and go back.  So, either the boot shouldn't pause, or the prompt should remain shown
2012-10-29T21:03:00.000Z	bazhang	ChogyDan	and if the drive is connected?
2012-10-29T21:04:00.000Z	ChogyDan	bazhang	it's fine.  It seems the boot process doesn't like the missing mount points
2012-10-29T21:04:00.000Z	bazhang	ChogyDan	and the drive is in fstab?
2012-10-29T21:04:00.000Z	ChogyDan		the drive is just extra storage.  Yes, I think it is in fstab, lemme check though
2012-10-29T21:05:00.000Z	bazhang	ChogyDan	and how long is this "pause"?
2012-10-29T21:05:00.000Z	ChogyDan		yea, fstabed.  Permanent
2012-10-29T21:06:00.000Z	bazhang		 ChogyDan, and how long is this "pause"?
2012-10-29T21:06:00.000Z	ChogyDan		unless I answer the prompt.  But when I first ran into this, I was hitting esc to see errors, and that wiped the prompt.  So I had no idea what was going on at first
2012-10-29T21:06:00.000Z	ChogyDan	bazhang	I tested for at least 20 minutes.  Im guessing permanent
2012-10-29T21:07:00.000Z	bazhang	ChogyDan	the system pauses for 20 minutes during boot?
2012-10-29T21:07:00.000Z	ChogyDan	bazhang	it never actually booted
2012-10-29T21:08:00.000Z	bazhang	ChogyDan	what  is the "pause" you mention then
2012-10-29T21:10:00.000Z	ChogyDan	bazhang	I call it a pause because there is a prompt requesting what to do with the mount points.  This prompt can get hidden, but if you answer it, boot continues.  So it is a prompt that pauses the boot process until answered.  (Now I know how to get past it)
2012-10-29T21:13:00.000Z	ChogyDan	bazhang	nm, I guess the package is mountall: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/mountall/+bug/571444
