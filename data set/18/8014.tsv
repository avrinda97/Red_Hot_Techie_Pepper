2008-08-21T09:08:00.000Z	journey4712		whiz2: pretty generic question,  how exactly are you copying files?  FTP, samba, other?
2008-08-21T09:08:00.000Z	journey4712		scp perhaps
2008-08-21T09:09:00.000Z	journey4712		whiz2: can you mount(map on windows) the remote share, and get read only access, just not write?
2008-08-21T09:10:00.000Z	journey4712		i had better luck with virtualbox vs vmware, but thats just one experience
2008-08-21T09:11:00.000Z	Zar	journey4712	 do you know how to make the bridge network  work?
2008-08-21T09:11:00.000Z	Zar	journey4712	 on XP virtualbox?
2008-08-21T09:13:00.000Z	Zar	journey4712	thanks
2008-08-21T09:14:00.000Z	Zar	journey4712	 already tried a script like that. It doesn't work
2008-08-21T09:17:00.000Z	Zar	journey4712	 do you have to run the script on boot every time to make the configuration permanent?
2008-08-21T09:18:00.000Z	Zar	journey4712	makes sense
2008-08-21T09:24:00.000Z	Zar	journey4712	 that is exactly what I want. I don't need something like Wireshark for now.
2008-08-21T09:25:00.000Z	Zar	journey4712	 can I get iptraf from main repositories?
2008-08-21T09:27:00.000Z	Zar	journey4712	 nevermind, found it with google
2008-08-21T09:30:00.000Z	Zar	journey4712	 I was looking in the application manager instead of Synaptic. Is already there thanks.  another application question. Do you know a good alternative for the default Remote Desktop Viewer that let me connect to a machine using XP and Ultr@VNC
2008-08-21T09:30:00.000Z	Zar	journey4712	 np
2008-08-21T09:31:00.000Z	Zar	journey4712	 I'm starting to love Ubuntu. The applet is already installed hehehehe
2008-08-21T09:35:00.000Z	Zar	journey4712	 and now the iptraf is on my desktop working like a charm :-) thanks again
2008-08-21T09:38:00.000Z	Zar	journey4712	 now I just have to fix my problem with Gufw. Any idea why it is locked or how to unlock it?
