2005-09-20T12:09:00.000Z	cafuego	Lethal-Rocks	/etc/modutils/rausb
2005-09-20T12:09:00.000Z	cafuego	Lethal-Rocks	But with '>' and not '|'.
2005-09-20T12:10:00.000Z	Lethal-Rocks	cafuego	it's on the wiki, so I beleive it :P
2005-09-20T12:10:00.000Z	cafuego	Lethal-Rocks	No, the wiki doesn't say to echo that into a pipe. Or if it does, it's wrong.
2005-09-20T12:11:00.000Z	Lethal-Rocks	cafuego	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Rt2500WirelessCardsHowTo Under "And what if I don't need RaConfig"

2005-09-20T12:12:00.000Z	cafuego	Lethal-Rocks	Ah, to tee.
2005-09-20T12:12:00.000Z	cafuego	Lethal-Rocks	yeah, '>' is the same as '| tee'
