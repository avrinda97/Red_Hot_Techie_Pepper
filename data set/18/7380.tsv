2011-09-24T13:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mobal	its a boot loader, why bother?
2011-09-24T13:43:00.000Z	mobal	ActionParsnip	very ugly :<
2011-09-24T13:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mobal	its on the screen for less than 2 seconds..
2011-09-24T13:44:00.000Z	mobal	ActionParsnip	i know, but if possible to get full hd res. than i want to try it
2011-09-24T13:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mobal	you can set the res in /etc/default/grub
2011-09-24T13:46:00.000Z	mobal	ActionParsnip	i know, but Framebuffer 1920*1080 is unsupported by NVidia
2011-09-24T13:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mobal	sudo apt-get install hwinfo; sudo hwinfo --framebuffer
2011-09-24T13:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mobal	will show the available resolutions

Its really a worthless effort, but if you need to occupy yourself, why not
2011-09-24T13:48:00.000Z	mobal	ActionParsnip	yes. 1920 is unavaliable. i know. but it is possible to get resolution without framebuffer? like with a driver or etc?
2011-09-24T13:51:00.000Z	mobal	ActionParsnip	i think if 1920 is not supported, i cannot get that resolution :(
2011-09-24T13:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mobal	not if you use proprietary drivers, they don't load fast enough so you probably get no boot splash. That link is all I know of grub configs as its not of any value
2011-09-24T13:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mobal	maybe others can advise
