2011-08-03T21:28:00.000Z	marriedman624		I need some help, I'm trying to use "sudo" commands and it says i'm not in the sudoers file...........but when I look at the file is it has ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
2011-08-03T21:29:00.000Z	usr13	marriedman624	Is this the original user that was created during install?
2011-08-03T21:29:00.000Z	usr13	marriedman624	Is this user a member of admin group?
2011-08-03T21:30:00.000Z	usr13	marriedman624	grep admin /etc/group
2011-08-03T21:32:00.000Z	marriedman624	usr13	I get lpadmin:x:112:admin:x:120:
2011-08-03T21:34:00.000Z	usr13	marriedman624	If you are not in the admin group, you'll more-than-likely need to boot from a LiveCD and edit /etc/group and put your user at the end of that line.
2011-08-03T21:34:00.000Z	usr13	marriedman624	I'm wondering how it got changed in the first place?
2011-08-03T21:35:00.000Z	usr13	marriedman624	Is "lpadmin:x:112:admin:x:120:"  all on one line?
2011-08-03T21:42:00.000Z	usr13	marriedman624	edit /etc/group
2011-08-03T21:42:00.000Z	usr13	marriedman624	Change line  admin:x:120:  to admin:x:120:marriedman624
2011-08-03T21:44:00.000Z	marriedman624	usr13	But I can't do that until I have sudo right?
2011-08-03T21:44:00.000Z	usr13	marriedman624	As I said before, boot to LiveCD
2011-08-03T21:45:00.000Z	usr13	marriedman624	If you are not in the admin group, you'll more-than-likely need to boot from a LiveCD and edit /etc/group and put your user at the end of that line.

2011-08-04T03:15:00.000Z	usr13	marriedman624	Sure
