2012-06-17T22:10:00.000Z	Matthewlawson3		Hey guys I am fairly new to ubuntu and I downloaded and installed the  codecs needed to run dvds and play mp3 etc, and now my Youtube videos in Chrome goes black on fullscreen. Can someone help me resolve this? I assume its a conflict between Chrome flash and the flash installed in the codec pack. Fullscreen worked fine before
2012-06-17T22:12:00.000Z	Relondo	Matthewlawson3	Do you have CCSM?
2012-06-17T22:12:00.000Z	Matthewlawson3		What is CCSM? forgive me
2012-06-17T22:13:00.000Z	Relondo	Matthewlawson3	No, it's fine. Go to Ubuntu Software Center and search for Compiz Settings Manager.
2012-06-17T22:14:00.000Z	Matthewlawson3		What will CCSM allow me to do in regard to my flash Chrome issue?
2012-06-17T22:14:00.000Z	Relondo	Matthewlawson3	It will allow you to change some necessary settings.
2012-06-17T22:14:00.000Z	Matthewlawson3		ok hang on Relondo
2012-06-17T22:16:00.000Z	Matthewlawson3		Ok Relondo installing....what do I do after its installed?
2012-06-17T22:17:00.000Z	Relondo	Matthewlawson3	After it's installed, run it, go to the OpenGL tab, and make sure Sync is set to VBlank.
2012-06-17T22:17:00.000Z	Matthewlawson3		OK hang on
2012-06-17T22:18:00.000Z	Relondo	Matthewlawson3	After that, when you load up the video, right-click it, choose Settings>Display, and uncheck Enable Hardware Acceleration. If you can't access that menu in Chrome, do it from Firefox, and the problem should be fixed in Chrome, as well.
2012-06-17T22:18:00.000Z	Matthewlawson3	Relondo	what is terminal run command for it?
2012-06-17T22:18:00.000Z	Matthewlawson3		or where is it in the applications
2012-06-17T22:19:00.000Z	Relondo		If you get it from the software center, you can just search for CCSM in the dash.
2012-06-17T22:20:00.000Z	Relondo	Matthewlawson3	Sorry, but I need to go. Hope that works for you :)
2012-06-17T22:21:00.000Z	Matthewlawson3		OK thanks
2012-06-17T22:21:00.000Z	Matthewlawson3		Appreciate it
2012-06-17T22:21:00.000Z	Relondo	Matthewlawson3	No problem. Later.
