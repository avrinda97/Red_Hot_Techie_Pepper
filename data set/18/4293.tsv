2009-08-10T03:44:00.000Z	BeWop		Hello, I'm having a problem with the game StepMania. It closes out each time I exit or hit the tab button. Anyone know what might be causing this and how to fix it?
2009-08-10T03:44:00.000Z	BeWop		*logs off
2009-08-10T03:44:00.000Z	BeWop		Not closes out
2009-08-10T03:45:00.000Z	BeWop		Does anyone know how to fix this?
2009-08-10T03:46:00.000Z	BeWop		I'm having a problem with the game StepMania. It logs off my user each time I exit or hit the tab button exsessivly.
2009-08-10T03:46:00.000Z	BeWop		It's really quite annoying as I'm trying to download stuff =P
2009-08-10T03:47:00.000Z	Flannel	BeWop	What it's doing is crashing your X, which automatically restarts.
2009-08-10T03:47:00.000Z	BeWop		Ah
2009-08-10T03:47:00.000Z	BeWop		How can i fix this?
2009-08-10T03:47:00.000Z	Flannel	BeWop	(its crashing, and taking X out with it)
2009-08-10T03:47:00.000Z	BeWop		It's crashing even though I told it to quit?
2009-08-10T03:48:00.000Z	Flannel	BeWop	I suppose?  It might not be crashing, but X isn't liking whatever its doing.  Check launchpad for a bug report, if there isn't one, file one.
2009-08-10T03:48:00.000Z	BeWop		Alright
2009-08-10T03:48:00.000Z	BeWop		Anything else I can do?
2009-08-10T03:48:00.000Z	Flannel	BeWop	Probably, but I don't know what.
2009-08-10T03:48:00.000Z	BeWop		k
2009-08-10T03:49:00.000Z	BeWop	Flannel	thanks
2009-08-10T03:49:00.000Z	BeWop	Flannel	How exactly do I check launchpad? =P
