2004-09-29T06:39:00.000Z	giard		flash... what a pain... macromedia needs to open source the viewer
2004-09-29T06:40:00.000Z	sanxiyn	giard	Help open source projects implementing SWF standard.
2004-09-29T06:40:00.000Z	sanxiyn	giard	Depending on Macromedia's binary is not a solution.
2004-09-29T06:41:00.000Z	sanxiyn	giard	Take a look at http://swfdec.sf.net/ and http://gplflash.sf.net/ .
2004-09-29T06:41:00.000Z	giard	sanxiyn	are those still in active development?  Last I tried them they weren't very accurate
2004-09-29T06:42:00.000Z	sanxiyn	giard	I found swfdec to be adequate for *my* purposes.
2004-09-29T06:42:00.000Z	sanxiyn	giard	Yes swfdec is active, and gplflash was once discontinued but they released fix in 2004.
2004-09-29T06:43:00.000Z	sanxiyn	giard	swfdec cooperates with GStreamer (to-be-freedesktop.org-supported media framework)
2004-09-29T06:43:00.000Z	giard		swfdec hasn't released an update in almost a year and a half if you go by their website
2004-09-29T06:44:00.000Z	sanxiyn	giard	Well, but it's still active. :-)
2004-09-29T06:44:00.000Z	sanxiyn	giard	Help them integrating ActionScript compiler from Ming project.
2004-09-29T06:44:00.000Z	sanxiyn	giard	Ming is PHP Flash generator, that has about the best open source ActionScript implementation.
2004-09-29T06:45:00.000Z	sanxiyn	giard	Even if they aren't active, relying on propreitary binary is *not* a solution.
2004-09-29T06:46:00.000Z	giard	sanxiyn	you'll get no arguments from me there.  the pain is that flash is so ubiquitous now
2004-09-29T06:47:00.000Z	giard	sanxiyn	we need a decent standard that browsers will include by default
2004-09-29T06:47:00.000Z	sanxiyn	giard	And Macromedia's is not a solution, so only solution is to help open-source Flash projects...
2004-09-29T06:47:00.000Z	sanxiyn	giard	Yes it is a pain.
2004-09-29T06:49:00.000Z	sanxiyn	giard	At least Flash is not software-patented. Thanks for that. :(
