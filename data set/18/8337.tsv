2007-09-02T16:00:00.000Z	SubSonik		hello all
2007-09-02T16:01:00.000Z	SubSonik		I am having problems with nvidia dvi output into my Sony HDTV. can anyone help?
2007-09-02T16:01:00.000Z	gerro	SubSonik	what have you done so far?
2007-09-02T16:02:00.000Z	gerro	SubSonik	dvi stands for digital video input so how can it be outputting?
2007-09-02T16:02:00.000Z	SubSonik	gerro	I installed the OS and got everything working on a flat screen monitor. However, when I switched to teh DVI, I could only get up to 800x600
2007-09-02T16:03:00.000Z	gerro	SubSonik	is that possibly a xorg.conf issue?
2007-09-03T16:04:00.000Z	SubSonik	gerro	might be, seems to be what the forums are hinting at, but before I fiddle with it I wanted a second opinion.
2007-09-03T16:05:00.000Z	gerro	SubSonik	hmm you could try turning the color down then raising the resolution
2007-09-03T16:05:00.000Z	gerro	SubSonik	or it might be some frame buffering issue (or that term is completely made up to hide weeeird screen glitches)
2007-09-03T16:06:00.000Z	SubSonik	gerro	the forum suggested lowering the depth to 16 and eliminating the availavle resolutions. whatddaya think?
2007-09-03T16:06:00.000Z	gerro	SubSonik	yeah that could work
2007-09-03T16:06:00.000Z	SubSonik	gerro	ok, well, got my second opinon. be back in a bit and let you know if it worked...
2007-09-03T16:07:00.000Z	gerro	SubSonik	are you trying to use your tv for computer monitor? make sure you set refresh rates correctly and all that try checking this site called monitor world its nice
2007-09-03T16:07:00.000Z	SubSonik	gerro	also, since you brought up 64 bit, any flash plugins for 64 bit available? I keep getting install errors when I try
2007-09-03T16:08:00.000Z	gerro	SubSonik	use x86 OS most motherboards support both
2007-09-03T16:09:00.000Z	SubSonik	gerro	+ psylon, what a waste of a perfectly good processor.
2007-09-03T16:09:00.000Z	gerro	SubSonik	if you insist on using 64 bit then run firefox under wine, or use that netscape plugin that was ported to firefox to use as wrapper for things I forget its name, or you could try that gnash open source flash
2007-09-03T16:10:00.000Z	gerro	SubSonik	get better performance from x86, if you don't write code it shouldn't matter which you use
