2012-07-03T09:23:00.000Z	OerHeks	V3NG3NC3678	if it is ATI, then it is so old that even nouveau doesn't support it.
2012-07-03T09:26:00.000Z	OerHeks	V3NG3NC3678	with flash you would want dual core.
2012-07-03T09:27:00.000Z	OerHeks	V3NG3NC3678	well this is getting offtopic. find the ati card specs, so we can help you.
2012-07-05T02:50:00.000Z	OerHeks	V3NG3NC3678	do you have an ubuntu support question?
2012-07-05T02:51:00.000Z	OerHeks	V3NG3NC3678	join #ubuntu-offtopic for that.
