2007-06-29T14:25:00.000Z	b3t0		i got a problem
2007-06-29T14:25:00.000Z	b3t0		i just got the ubuntu live cd, the 64-bit i think
2007-06-29T14:25:00.000Z	b3t0		and it wont work on my laptop
2007-06-29T14:26:00.000Z	tbtroja	b3t0	is your laptop a 64bit?
2007-06-29T14:26:00.000Z	tbtroja	b3t0	what processor does your laptop have?
2007-06-29T14:27:00.000Z	tbtroja	b3t0	okay, and what happens when you insert the CD and reboot (with the CD still in)?
2007-06-29T14:28:00.000Z	tbtroja	b3t0	doesn't do anything with the CD, just goes right to Vista?
2007-06-29T14:28:00.000Z	tbtroja	b3t0	then you try to boot into Ubuntu (and please don't use all caps, it's annoying)
2007-06-29T14:29:00.000Z	tbtroja	b3t0	have you let that sit for a little bit and see if it loads, and have you tried the Check CD for Defects at the Ubuntu Menu when you boot?
2007-06-29T14:30:00.000Z	tbtroja	b3t0	I'm guessing no defects were found?
2007-06-29T14:32:00.000Z	tbtroja	b3t0	okay, have you tried messing with the settings that you can select before you choose to boot? (Screen resolution, etc.)  If not try the resolution that you use on Vista or maybe lower to be safe and try that.
2007-06-29T14:33:00.000Z	tbtroja	b3t0	alright, let me know how it turns out.  And yes, a 64bit laptop with a 64bit CD should be fine.
2007-06-29T14:34:00.000Z	tbtroja	b3t0	no, but you said it was an AMB Turion64, right?
2007-06-29T14:34:00.000Z	tbtroja	b3t0	than you should be fine.

2007-06-29T14:38:00.000Z	tbtroja	b3t0	there might be a better guide then that, but if you want something better, look for yourself :P
2007-06-29T14:40:00.000Z	tbtroja	b3t0	I'm off to bed, I hope everything works out.
