2007-03-20T06:39:00.000Z	Factory		I still have access to my router. Is there a reason why one of my hosts can't use the internet?
2007-03-20T06:40:00.000Z	zahlerstreik	Factory	is it only your ubuntu / new update of ubuntu that doesnt work?
2007-03-20T06:40:00.000Z	Factory	zahlerstreik	negative, just apparently stopped working
2007-03-20T06:40:00.000Z	Factory	zahlerstreik	the user says it was flakey all day
2007-03-20T06:41:00.000Z	zahlerstreik	Factory	If you can get a dhcp addr i would imagine it is a problem with the network, not the client. (but im usually wrong about anything linux)
2007-03-20T06:42:00.000Z	Factory	zahlerstreik	actually, it's a static address
2007-03-20T06:42:00.000Z	zahlerstreik	Factory	it's an ubuntu box, right?
2007-03-20T06:43:00.000Z	Factory	zahlerstreik	haha, well I _am_ in #ubuntu asking this question, aren't I? =p
2007-03-20T06:44:00.000Z	Factory	zahlerstreik	uh. That's impossible.,
2007-03-20T06:44:00.000Z	Factory	zahlerstreik	 But I WILL set it to dhcp instead and try that
2007-03-20T06:45:00.000Z	zahlerstreik	Factory	what do you use for DHCP on your network
2007-03-20T06:45:00.000Z	Factory	zahlerstreik	Well, I think on ANY network, dhcp give the computer a randomly generated Ip address.
2007-03-20T06:45:00.000Z	Factory	zahlerstreik	well not totally randomly
2007-03-20T06:45:00.000Z	zahlerstreik	Factory	right, but most you can configure
2007-03-20T06:46:00.000Z	Factory	zahlerstreik	AH, well if that is true, I have no idea.
2007-03-20T06:46:00.000Z	zahlerstreik	Factory	the default windows one lets you map MACs to IPs
2007-03-20T06:48:00.000Z	Factory	zahlerstreik	alright, setting it to dhcp worked. Any reason why static DIDN'T work that you can think of?
2007-03-20T06:49:00.000Z	zahlerstreik	Factory	probably the prog u use
