2006-03-14T16:45:00.000Z	Viper_0		I can't open a file .php3 with Firefox, it asks me to Save the file, the file i want to open is /etc/freeradius-dialupadmin/config.php3, anybody can help?
2006-03-14T16:46:00.000Z	Enthusiast78	Viper_0	Are you trying to open that file directly?
2006-03-14T16:46:00.000Z	Viper_0	Enthusiast78	yes
2006-03-14T16:48:00.000Z	Enthusiast78	Viper_0	.php3 files must be 'parsed' to make sense in a browser... So they must be either served through a webserver such as Apache, or you can parse them manually with 'php /etc/freeradius-dialupadmin/config.php3 > result.html'.
2006-03-14T16:51:00.000Z	Viper_0	Enthusiast78	but i can't find the php command
2006-03-14T16:51:00.000Z	Enthusiast78	Viper_0	perhaps you have to install it with 'sudo aptitude install php'.
2006-03-14T16:53:00.000Z	Viper_0	Enthusiast78	I have installed php4
2006-03-14T16:53:00.000Z	Enthusiast78	Viper_0	In the terminal, if you type 'php' and hit TAB, what happens?
2006-03-14T16:55:00.000Z	Viper_0	Enthusiast78	 Display all the XXX possibilities?
2006-03-14T16:57:00.000Z	Enthusiast78	Viper_0	hit TAB again and see if something like php4 appears...
2006-03-15T17:06:00.000Z	Viper_0	Enthusiast78	 nothing
2006-03-15T17:07:00.000Z	Enthusiast78	Viper_0	Sorry but I think you better set up apache as well and put that file under your document root... :o/
2006-03-15T17:09:00.000Z	Viper_0	Enthusiast78	i can't move the file because it uses another files, from diferent locations
2006-03-15T17:10:00.000Z	Viper_0	Enthusiast78	how can i change the webserver from /var/www to /
2006-03-15T17:10:00.000Z	Enthusiast78	Viper_0	You could try setting documentroot to that directory
2006-03-15T17:10:00.000Z	Enthusiast78	Viper_0	I guess you'll have to edit httpd.conf and set DocumentRoot and the related Directory entries to the directory you want instead.
2006-03-15T17:11:00.000Z	Viper_0	Enthusiast78	i will try
2006-03-15T17:12:00.000Z	Enthusiast78	Viper_0	Good luck! :o)
