2006-12-31T16:24:00.000Z	violot		Good for chatting with Linux users, as you said you wanted
2006-12-31T16:24:00.000Z	violot		It is more informal than here
2006-12-31T16:24:00.000Z	violot		And less busy
2006-12-31T16:24:00.000Z	violot		gnome-terminal -e "foo; foo"
2006-12-31T16:25:00.000Z	violot		No problem
2006-12-31T16:25:00.000Z	WindyCN	violot	could I PM you? I need to clarify how that works and i don't want to clutter the channel
2006-12-31T16:27:00.000Z	WindyCN	violot	what does the -e switch do?
2006-12-31T16:27:00.000Z	violot	WindyCN	it executes a command
2006-12-31T16:28:00.000Z	violot	WindyCN	"foo; foobar" runs foo then foobar
2006-12-31T16:28:00.000Z	violot	WindyCN	Then why did you want to run it in the terminal? :P
2006-12-31T16:28:00.000Z	violot	WindyCN	like minimize it?
2006-12-31T16:34:00.000Z	WindyCN	violot	it doesn't allow me to send PMs since i'm not a registered user
