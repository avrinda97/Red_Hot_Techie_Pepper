2011-05-12T04:45:00.000Z	walter		i cant install ubuntu.. it says upgrade bios or use forced=something..
2011-05-12T04:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	walter	did you MD5 test the ISO you downloaded?
2011-05-12T04:46:00.000Z	walter	ActionParsnip	nope..cause i already used the cd in other pc's and it goes without error
2011-05-12T04:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	walter	does the RAM test OK?
2011-05-12T04:47:00.000Z	walter	ActionParsnip	i didnt actually do the ram test cause it doesnt appear :)
2011-05-12T04:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	walter	it doesn't by default, when you see the keyboard + stickman screen, press SPACE. You can also test the CD for defects there as well
2011-05-12T04:49:00.000Z	walter	ActionParsnip	i see.. so what am i going to do? btw my pc is kinda old
2011-05-12T04:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	walter	old is moot, as long as the ram is healthy it will be fine
