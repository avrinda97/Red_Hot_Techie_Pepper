2005-12-28T12:33:00.000Z	navarone		vodnik...do you get error message about missing os?
2005-12-28T12:34:00.000Z	vodnik	navarone	no, it just fails to mount:-/
2005-12-28T12:35:00.000Z	navarone		vodnik...ok...was thinking maybe you made wrong partition/drive bootable while in PM. I did that once ina  partition manager...lol
2005-12-28T12:36:00.000Z	vodnik		could be the problem in the fact that hda7 is not first logical partition on local harddrive? I heve got hda6 (ext3 as well) withh some data on it
2005-12-28T12:36:00.000Z	navarone	vodnik	are you dual booting?
2005-12-28T12:36:00.000Z	vodnik		navarone:yes, i booted to windows right now
2005-12-28T12:37:00.000Z	vodnik	navarone	i was in working ubuntu an hour ago, then i updated to new kernel and i cannot boot anymore:-(
2005-12-28T12:37:00.000Z	navarone	vodnik	I and anyone else would have to see error messages to get better idea. Any chance of getting screenshot or copying error?
2005-12-28T12:38:00.000Z	navarone		vodnik...ahhh
2005-12-28T12:38:00.000Z	navarone	vodnik	are you using breezy?
2005-12-28T12:39:00.000Z	vodnik	navarone	i am using breezy and i could copy error messages with hand (do not have my digital camera here:-()
2005-12-28T12:40:00.000Z	navarone	vodnik	which arch and kernel?
2005-12-28T12:42:00.000Z	vodnik	navarone	kernel 2.6.12-10-386, architecture 686 (pentium mobile)
2005-12-28T12:42:00.000Z	vodnik		http://pastebin.com/476803 - this is my menu file for grub
2005-12-28T12:43:00.000Z	navarone	vodnik	perhaps try booting another kernel version in grub boot
2005-12-28T12:44:00.000Z	vodnik		navarone:i tried all four i have:-(
2005-12-28T12:45:00.000Z	navarone		vodnik...it does seem odd that /dev in menu says hda7 and not 6 but that maybe perfectly normal depending on how many partitions are on your drive
2005-12-28T12:48:00.000Z	vodnik	navarone	i got hda6 partition with data, hda5 is not there though
