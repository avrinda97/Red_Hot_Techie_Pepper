2008-11-22T18:32:00.000Z	shadewind		why does my xorg.conf look funny on a new install?
2008-11-22T18:32:00.000Z	shadewind		it looks nearly empty
2008-11-22T18:32:00.000Z	shadewind		no way that config could work...
2008-11-22T18:32:00.000Z	Chousuke	shadewind	it's supposed to be empty
2008-11-22T18:33:00.000Z	Chousuke	shadewind	x.org will autodetect as much as it can
2008-11-22T18:33:00.000Z	Chousuke	shadewind	usually, that is enough
2008-11-22T18:34:00.000Z	Chousuke	shadewind	as long as opensuse uses a new enough X
2008-11-22T18:34:00.000Z	shadewind	Chousuke	I see
2008-11-22T18:35:00.000Z	Chousuke	shadewind	a lot of work has gone into autodetection lately :)
2008-11-22T18:35:00.000Z	shadewind	Chousuke	I can see that
2008-11-22T18:36:00.000Z	shadewind	Chousuke	I like Ubuntu sort of... but I miss the configurability of openSUSE
2008-11-22T18:36:00.000Z	Chousuke	shadewind	I dunno about opensuse but ubuntu is plenty configurable :)
2008-11-22T18:36:00.000Z	shadewind	Chousuke	I'd prefer not have to open a terminal
2008-11-22T18:40:00.000Z	shadewind	Chousuke	though it seems that the autoconfig stuff totally breaks evertyhing with proprietary drivers
2008-11-22T18:40:00.000Z	Chousuke	shadewind	well, that's too bad.
2008-11-22T18:41:00.000Z	Chousuke	shadewind	I don't care for the proprietary stuff myself
2008-11-22T18:41:00.000Z	shadewind	Chousuke	okay. I prefer drivers that work.
2008-11-22T18:41:00.000Z	Chousuke	shadewind	yeah, so do I
