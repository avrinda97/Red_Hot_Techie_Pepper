2011-08-22T23:49:00.000Z	nicofs		I am trying to upgrade but all i get is "Authentication failed"... what might be the cause? can i override the authentication request?
2011-08-22T23:49:00.000Z	bullgard4_	nicofs	You better tell us what you did exactly in order to upgrade.
2011-08-22T23:51:00.000Z	bullgard4_	nicofs	Normally you cannot overrride the authentication request.
2011-08-22T23:52:00.000Z	bullgard4_	nicofs	Did you indeed try to authenticate and keyed in your password?
2011-08-22T23:53:00.000Z	nicofs	bullgard4_	for some reason, i'm not asked - even when i do "sudo -s" in console i am just granted admin rights...
2011-08-22T23:55:00.000Z	bullgard4_	nicofs	Oh! That's dangerous. It means that the password is not required in some circumstances. This is evil. You better check that carefully first without involving Update Manager.
2011-08-22T23:59:00.000Z	bullgard4_	nicofs	What is your Ubuntu release version?
2011-08-23T00:01:00.000Z	nicofs	bullgard4_	erm... good question actually - how do i find out? sources.list includes jaunty and karmic...
2011-08-23T00:04:00.000Z	bullgard4_	nicofs	'~$ lsb_release -a'
2011-08-23T00:05:00.000Z	nicofs	bullgard4_	hang on - will do that as soon as cpu is <100%
2011-08-23T00:06:00.000Z	nicofs	bullgard4_	9.10
2011-08-23T00:09:00.000Z	bullgard4_	nicofs	Ok. It seems that your sources.list is not okay. It should list only one distribution release. -- Probably there is something else out of order in your configuration. What does '~$ sudo apt-get update' return?
2011-08-23T00:10:00.000Z	nicofs	bullgard4_	as expected that some sources failed to download...
2011-08-23T00:10:00.000Z	bullgard4_	nicofs	But it did not complain about your password?
2011-08-23T00:11:00.000Z	nicofs	bullgard4_	how can it, i'm never prompted for any...
2011-08-23T00:13:00.000Z	bullgard4_	nicofs	Normally Uuntu asks you for a password if you prefix a command line command with 'sudo'. If Ubuntu does not, then you have disabled this necessity, and that is dangerous.
2011-08-23T00:13:00.000Z	nicofs	bullgard4_	i know what it normally does... but how can i re-enable that security feature...?!?
