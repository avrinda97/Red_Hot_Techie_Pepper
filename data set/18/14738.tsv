2005-10-03T12:01:00.000Z	sambagirl		how do you turn on apache?
2005-10-03T12:01:00.000Z	havoc	sambagirl	/etc/init.d/apache start
2005-10-03T12:03:00.000Z	havoc	sambagirl	you're sure you have apache installed?  I don't think it is by default
2005-10-03T12:04:00.000Z	havoc	sambagirl	no problem :)
2005-10-03T12:04:00.000Z	havoc	sambagirl	"apt-get install apache1" is one way
2005-10-03T12:05:00.000Z	havoc	sambagirl	or you can use a GUI software manager like 'aptitude'
2005-10-03T12:05:00.000Z	havoc	sambagirl	under the System menu somewhere in either gnome or kde
2005-10-03T12:07:00.000Z	havoc	sambagirl	 /etc/init.d/apache start
2005-10-03T12:07:00.000Z	havoc	sambagirl	<tab> completion is your friend
2005-10-03T12:11:00.000Z	havoc	sambagirl	what services?
2005-10-03T12:12:00.000Z	havoc	sambagirl	ah, sure, restart them
2005-10-03T12:12:00.000Z	havoc	sambagirl	it's an install script asking you this?
2005-10-03T12:29:00.000Z	havoc	sambagirl	that's what you wanted, right?
2005-10-03T12:30:00.000Z	havoc	sambagirl	I'm not sure what ubuntu comes with as far as a GUI apache configuration tool
2005-10-03T12:36:00.000Z	havoc	sambagirl	look for synaptic in the menus, likely under System somewhere
