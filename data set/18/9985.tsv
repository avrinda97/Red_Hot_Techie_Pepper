2007-01-26T11:37:00.000Z	corevette		flannel...it says my cd isn't inserted
2007-01-26T11:38:00.000Z	corevette		flannel..right after i did the apt-cdrom....it does that for some reason
2007-01-26T11:40:00.000Z	corevette		flannel..care to help?
2007-01-26T11:42:00.000Z	corevette		flannel...there is no error...its just the cdrom unmounts once the cdrom is read for packages
2007-01-26T11:43:00.000Z	corevette		flannel it says insert the cd....and i do....but then it still tries to get the packages from online
2007-01-26T11:44:00.000Z	corevette		sudo apt-get install [insert package]     flannel

2007-01-26T11:46:00.000Z	corevette		flannel i can try that too
2007-01-26T11:46:00.000Z	shatrat	corevette	are you on dapper or edgy?
2007-01-26T11:47:00.000Z	corevette	shatrat	edgy
2007-01-26T11:47:00.000Z	shatrat	corevette	then -generic is the way to go
2007-01-26T11:52:00.000Z	shatrat	corevette	so if you "ls /dev/cdrom" do you see anything?
2007-01-26T11:53:00.000Z	corevette	shatrat	all i get is /dev/cdrom as output
2007-01-26T11:59:00.000Z	shatrat	corevette	I've never used a cd as an apt source, i really dont know :(  Try copying the .deb from the CD to your home and then install it from there?
2007-02-10T17:30:00.000Z	shatrat	corevette	sudo apt-get install mysql?
2007-02-10T17:34:00.000Z	corevette	shatrat	how do i find out my mysql username/password??
