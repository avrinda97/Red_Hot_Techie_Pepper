2009-10-14T05:12:00.000Z	[Mr_Wizard]	SeaPhor	probably. i've been using ubuntu for about 4 months now and i'm usually able to fix things just googling but this one i can't really find. i don't know why 1280x800 would disappear out of the blue like that. seems weird
2009-10-14T05:14:00.000Z	SeaPhor	[Mr_Wizard]	so you had it working in native res before?

2009-10-14T05:16:00.000Z	[Mr_Wizard]	SeaPhor	attempted to have second desktop by plugging an HDTV into my HDMI input and failed miserably. then, while i messed with the settings 1280x800 and a bunch more resolutions just disappeared
