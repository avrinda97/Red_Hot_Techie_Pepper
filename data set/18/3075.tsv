2010-11-09T07:01:00.000Z	cannonfodder		hey you guys...i have nmap and netcat...and so far from what i read on google, both are able to scan lan ips?   if so, how do i do it?
2010-11-09T07:01:00.000Z	cannonfodder		i tried the man page but couldnt find anything for each
2010-11-09T07:02:00.000Z	cannonfodder		well i found stuff targetting a specific up
2010-11-09T07:02:00.000Z	smw	cannonfodder	nmap is for scanning. netcat is for... alot of stuff
2010-11-09T07:03:00.000Z	smw	cannonfodder	netcat is a general tool that is great for scripting, not scanning. nmap is a scanner
2010-11-09T07:03:00.000Z	cannonfodder	smw	i want something similar to windows angry ipscan
2010-11-09T07:03:00.000Z	cannonfodder	smw	ok on that note lol how do i scan my wlan for ips
2010-11-09T07:03:00.000Z	smw	cannonfodder	nmap-gtk
2010-11-09T07:04:00.000Z	cannonfodder	smw	 nmapfe == nmap-gtk   ?
2010-11-09T07:04:00.000Z	smw	cannonfodder	yeah
2010-11-09T07:04:00.000Z	smw	cannonfodder	sorry
2010-11-09T07:05:00.000Z	smw	cannonfodder	nmap x.x.x.* will scan a block
2010-11-09T07:05:00.000Z	cannonfodder	smw	  im also using aircrack-ng and actually have the mac addresses of the devices connected to my wlan
2010-11-09T07:07:00.000Z	smw	cannonfodder	read a tutorial. I can not completely teach you how to use the tool.
2010-11-09T07:08:00.000Z	smw	cannonfodder	chat rooms like this are a great place to get a push in the right direction.
2010-11-09T07:10:00.000Z	cannonfodder	smw	im a bit lost...all i really want is something that will scan my wlan for ips lol
2010-11-09T07:10:00.000Z	smw	cannonfodder	nmapfe should be self explanatory
2010-11-09T07:11:00.000Z	cannonfodder	smw	ill use it more in the terminal to see if i can get used to it lol
