2012-06-06T05:00:00.000Z	KRomo		anyone able to look a the paste bin?  id greatly appreciate guidance
2012-06-06T05:01:00.000Z	sacarlson	KRomo	does it boot slow more than one time?
2012-06-06T05:03:00.000Z	sacarlson	KRomo	lets take a look at the file /etc/fstab  pastebinit
2012-06-06T05:06:00.000Z	sacarlson	KRomo	what's the output of  blkid ?
2012-06-06T05:06:00.000Z	KRomo	sacarlson	how do i see that?
2012-06-06T05:07:00.000Z	sacarlson	KRomo	type  blkid at the term
2012-06-06T05:10:00.000Z	sacarlson	KRomo	I'm not sure, I don't see anything wrong, maybe it's a power up thing takes time for some device to start?
2012-06-06T05:14:00.000Z	sacarlson	KRomo	looks like this kernel bug https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux/+bug/910999
2012-06-06T05:14:00.000Z	sacarlson	KRomo	try another version of kernel
2012-06-06T05:15:00.000Z	sacarlson	KRomo	looks like a new problem so maybe go back to an older kernel
2012-06-06T05:17:00.000Z	sacarlson	KRomo	installing a kernel is much the same as install any other package
2012-06-06T05:20:00.000Z	sacarlson	KRomo	a swap drive is optional in your case it might be used to go from hybernate or standby to powerup.
2012-06-06T05:21:00.000Z	sacarlson	KRomo	did it have that problem when you booted from the cd or usb?
2012-06-06T05:26:00.000Z	sacarlson	KRomo	well then maybe the kernel version used in the cd/usb boot would be better
2012-06-06T05:27:00.000Z	sacarlson	KRomo	the cd boot linux version is many times an older version than what then end up installing
2012-06-06T05:28:00.000Z	sacarlson	KRomo	boot one of your cd/usb and do the command uname -a ;  to find out
2012-06-06T05:30:00.000Z	sacarlson	KRomo	you can also look in synaptic search for linux-image to see what versions of linux are available to install
2012-06-09T08:04:00.000Z	sacarlson	KRomo	that would require modifing the file /etc/fstab
