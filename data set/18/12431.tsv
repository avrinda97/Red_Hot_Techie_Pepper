2006-05-05T12:51:00.000Z	Steff_breezy	teclo	have you tried the Howto?
2006-05-05T12:51:00.000Z	teclo	Steff_breezy	if I go into System Settings > Printers, I can see six printers, including "Print to File" PDF, but I only see the first printer in the Mozilla print menu
2006-05-05T12:52:00.000Z	Steff_breezy	teclo	you can use pdf for a printer then
2006-05-05T12:52:00.000Z	Steff_breezy	teclo	tried to restart mozilla?
2006-05-05T12:52:00.000Z	teclo	Steff_breezy	ah, let's restart mozilla then
2006-05-05T12:54:00.000Z	teclo	Steff_breezy	still the same problem
2006-05-05T12:54:00.000Z	teclo	Steff_breezy	....if I go into System Settings > Printers, I can see six printers, including "Print to File" PDF, but I only see the first printer in the Mozilla print menu
2006-05-05T12:55:00.000Z	Steff_breezy	teclo	try to print a test page with the new pdf printer, try to use it from another app
2006-05-05T12:56:00.000Z	teclo	Steff_breezy	in OpenOffice also, I see only one printer
2006-05-05T12:57:00.000Z	Steff_breezy	teclo	hmm, test page from the printer works?
2006-05-05T12:57:00.000Z	teclo	Steff_breezy	question... all that stuff in the howto... to add a printer... is it in kde's "Printers" ... or in cups ?
