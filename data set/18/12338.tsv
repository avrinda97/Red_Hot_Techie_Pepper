2006-12-24T15:41:00.000Z	erpo	needhelp	I have used an iPod with linux. You need to eject it. Go to the command line and type "eject /dev/path/to/ipod" without the quotes.

2006-12-24T15:44:00.000Z	erpo	needhelp	Did it work?
2006-12-24T15:52:00.000Z	needhelp		how do I export songs to iPod? Should I use gtkpod or just by copying them to /mount/ipod/ ?
2006-12-24T15:54:00.000Z	erpo	needhelp	The built-in ipod firmware will not read music that you just copy to /media/ipod --  you have to use gtkpod or an equivalent program.
2006-12-24T15:55:00.000Z	needhelp	erpo	but first I have to do mount /media/ipod'
2006-12-24T15:55:00.000Z	needhelp	erpo	but first I have to do 'mount /media/ipod' before I can play with gtkpod ?
2006-12-24T15:55:00.000Z	erpo	needhelp	When you connect your ipod to your computer, your computer should automatically mount it at /mount/ipod.
2006-12-24T15:56:00.000Z	erpo	needhelp	But yes, your ipod must be mounted before gtkpod can work.
2006-12-24T15:56:00.000Z	needhelp	erpo	I just did eject it, doesnt it get unoumted then?
2006-12-24T15:57:00.000Z	erpo	needhelp	When you eject a removable usb hard drive, it is first unmounted and then ejected.
2006-12-24T15:57:00.000Z	erpo	needhelp	To try gtkpod, unplug your ipod and plug it back in. That will mount it again.
2006-12-24T15:59:00.000Z	needhelp	erpo	when I unplug/replug the ipod, the Do not disconnect-message appears again and stays there until I eject it
2006-12-24T16:00:00.000Z	erpo	needhelp	That's fine. That is what's supposed to happen.
2006-12-24T16:00:00.000Z	erpo		When your iPod says "Do not disconnect", that's the time to run gtkpod.
2006-12-24T16:03:00.000Z	needhelp	erpo	ok. Now I've selected some MP3 dirs with the "+ Dirs"-button. How do I send them to the iPod ?
2006-12-24T16:04:00.000Z	needhelp	erpo	Sync-button does not work
