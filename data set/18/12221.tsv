2012-02-21T04:17:00.000Z	ikonia	anonymousinuk	where did you get the iso
2012-02-21T04:17:00.000Z	ikonia	anonymousinuk	if you call microsoft they will send you out a replacment CD
2012-02-21T04:18:00.000Z	ikonia	anonymousinuk	it is unwise to try to use media not provided with your license
2012-02-21T04:18:00.000Z	ikonia	anonymousinuk	they do it for free, I have used the service when I stood on my CD
2012-02-21T04:19:00.000Z	ikonia	anonymousinuk	if you call microsoft they will send you a CD
2012-02-21T04:20:00.000Z	ikonia	anonymousinuk	ok - here we go. Contact microsoft for media, this channel is for ubuntu support.
2012-02-21T04:20:00.000Z	ikonia	anonymousinuk	please stop asking - contact microsoft, they will give you media if you have a valid license
2012-02-21T04:22:00.000Z	ikonia	anonymousinuk	contact microsoft UK, they will guide you through the process, even if it's OEM
2012-02-21T04:23:00.000Z	ikonia	anonymousinuk	no, it doesn't
2012-02-21T04:24:00.000Z	ikonia	anonymousinuk	that is probably because the torrent image is bad
2012-02-21T04:24:00.000Z	ikonia	anonymousinuk	contact microsoft and get a known good media source from them
