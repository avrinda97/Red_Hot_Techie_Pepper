2009-11-22T09:13:00.000Z	sync3times	Wallace	so what is the beef with fetchmail?
2009-11-22T09:13:00.000Z	Wallace	sync3times	it retrieves *all* of my email every time...even with nofetchall set :(
2009-11-22T09:14:00.000Z	sync3times	Wallace	you are telling it to leave mail on the server?
2009-11-22T09:14:00.000Z	Wallace	sync3times	yes, but even so, it should only retrieve messages which haven't been seen before
2009-11-22T09:15:00.000Z	sync3times	Wallace	but why would you do that.   If you just want to read mail, use google
2009-11-22T09:16:00.000Z	Wallace	sync3times	yuck, not going near googlemail....i have a mail account at my isp - i want to retrieve it locally, and then make it available via imap
2009-11-22T09:17:00.000Z	sync3times	Wallace	fine, then why are you leaving it to build up on the isp server?
2009-11-22T09:17:00.000Z	Wallace	sync3times	i got it all sorted, except for the part where it retrieves all messages every time - despite the option not to do so :\
2009-11-22T09:17:00.000Z	Wallace	sync3times	cus I don't trust it yet - i might want to fall back to pop3 directly from thunderbird to isp
2009-11-22T09:18:00.000Z	Wallace	sync3times	isp deletes it after a month anyway
2009-11-22T09:18:00.000Z	sync3times	Wallace	ah
2009-11-22T09:19:00.000Z	Wallace	sync3times	so....if fetchmail did what it said, and "nofetchall" retrieved just the unseen messages, everything would be happy.  but for some reason, nofetchall is having no effect :(
2009-11-22T09:19:00.000Z	sync3times	Wallace	does your isp support forwarding your mail to another account?
2009-11-22T09:19:00.000Z	Wallace	sync3times	i can't figure it out, so i wanna try something else
2009-11-22T09:19:00.000Z	Wallace	sync3times	no, no forwarding
2009-11-22T09:20:00.000Z	sync3times	Wallace	luck
2009-11-22T09:21:00.000Z	Wallace	sync3times	thanks :\
