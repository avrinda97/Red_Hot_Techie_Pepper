2007-04-11T12:25:00.000Z	foug		o, ok well
2007-04-11T12:25:00.000Z	foug		i tell my taskbar to not expand, but it never listens. It's always expanded. Also, anytime I restart my comp my two bars (taskbar and the bar with applications, system, places) never stay where i put them. And i have to go through hell getting them back toi where they were
2007-04-11T12:26:00.000Z	foug		also, I don't think my memory monitor works correctly. It never changes either
2007-04-11T12:26:00.000Z	foug		Other times, all my Windows will kind of flicker. Like when I alt tab or sometimes log on
2007-04-11T12:28:00.000Z	foug		lol
2007-04-11T12:29:00.000Z	foug		I just want everything to work. So far i'm not impressed with linux
2007-04-11T12:29:00.000Z	foug		See, my music player (Eviale) just changed song, and all my windows flickered
2007-04-11T12:29:00.000Z	foug		someone earlier said it might be terminal issues?
2007-04-11T12:30:00.000Z	foug		what's the diff between KDE and Gnome?
2007-04-11T12:31:00.000Z	foug		how would i go about installing my video card drivers? i know it's complicated isn't it?
2007-04-11T12:31:00.000Z	mapez	foug	what card
2007-04-11T12:32:00.000Z	mapez	foug	if your on feisty sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx
2007-04-11T12:32:00.000Z	foug	mapez	nope, 6.10. I thought fiesty wasn't out yet?
2007-04-11T12:33:00.000Z	mapez	foug	its a beta, but still 'stable' in my opinion.. The switch wont be a waste of time once you get used to it.. And that command I gave you should work with 6.10
2007-04-11T12:36:00.000Z	foug	mapez	allright cool, thanks man
2007-04-11T12:36:00.000Z	mapez	foug	ctrl alt backspace will restart x
2007-04-11T12:37:00.000Z	mapez	foug	its the windowing stuff.. I guess you could say
2007-04-11T12:37:00.000Z	foug	mapez	o
