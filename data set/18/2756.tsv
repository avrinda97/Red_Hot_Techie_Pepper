2010-03-13T01:51:00.000Z	serverduck	acicula	i'm a beginner user don't know exactly what to look for and some things from the log sounds chinese yet to me.
2010-03-13T01:52:00.000Z	acicula	serverduck	im sorry what problem were you trying to fix again?
2010-03-13T01:53:00.000Z	serverduck	acicula	 well i wanted to turn off my laptop because i had to go to work and it would't turn of...the ubuntu logo white was staying on my black screen

2010-03-13T01:53:00.000Z	acicula	serverduck	does suspend or hibernate work?
2010-03-13T01:53:00.000Z	serverduck	acicula	and i want to know why it failed to shut down and how to fix it...so in the future i will not have this problem again
2010-03-13T01:54:00.000Z	serverduck	acicula	didn't tried..only logout
2010-03-13T01:54:00.000Z	serverduck	acicula	logout works

2010-03-13T02:01:00.000Z	serverduck	acicula	 did you get my message?
2010-03-13T02:02:00.000Z	serverduck	acicula	 and i have a tray icon i have never seen before says something like session active not inhibited screen idle..if you see this text your display server is broken
2010-03-13T02:34:00.000Z	acicula	serverduck	its probably whats blocking the shutdown/hibernate process
