2008-01-22T11:25:00.000Z	chap	kr00l	home server?  I have the server version working
2008-01-22T11:26:00.000Z	kr00l	chap	can i DL ubuntu sever and get it to work as a home server for files and e-mail?
2008-01-22T11:27:00.000Z	chap	kr00l	Ubuntu server provides Samba, mail server, DNS, LAMP, and various other tools
2008-01-22T11:27:00.000Z	kr00l	chap	so could i use it at home? Is it easy to setup
2008-01-22T11:28:00.000Z	chap	kr00l	from my experience the packages are partially configured.  I've been doing quite a bit of googling to figure it out
2008-01-22T11:29:00.000Z	kr00l		chap; great, all i want is an easy to use file server
2008-01-22T11:29:00.000Z	chap	kr00l	i just got samba running.  It wasn't too much trouble (a few hours for the noob inside me)
2008-01-22T11:30:00.000Z	kr00l	chap	lots of noob in me
2008-01-22T11:30:00.000Z	chap	kr00l	samba will let you setup shares with windows and other *nix pc's.
2008-01-22T11:31:00.000Z	kr00l	chap	i don't know how to master the command line and ubuntu server is only commandline
2008-01-22T11:32:00.000Z	chap	kr00l	 if you like you can install the desktop version and tack on the server package
2008-01-22T11:32:00.000Z	kr00l	chap	how so?
2008-01-22T11:33:00.000Z	chap	kr00l	if you are just trying to file share and find the command line creepy, the desktop version can share over the network as well without any command-fu
2008-01-22T11:34:00.000Z	chap	kr00l	its integrated into gnome pretty well
2008-01-22T11:34:00.000Z	kr00l	chap	well I want to set up a home server where i can put all my media crap and access it on any computer in my house
2008-01-22T11:36:00.000Z	chap	kr00l	try and see what you like.  If one is too awkward you can always reinstall
2008-01-22T11:36:00.000Z	kr00l	chap	yeah i'll have to get used to ubuntu desktop first
