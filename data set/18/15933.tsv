2005-12-09T11:47:00.000Z	mgedmin	Chrisx1	yes
2005-12-09T11:48:00.000Z	mgedmin	Chrisx1	if you want easy-to-install Internet sharing, all you have to do is install two packages: ipmasq and dnsmasq
2005-12-09T11:48:00.000Z	mgedmin	Chrisx1	if you want to specify your own firewall rules, then it is better to not install ipmasq
2005-12-09T12:57:00.000Z	mgedmin	Chrisx1	is there a DHCP server in your local network?
2005-12-09T13:03:00.000Z	mgedmin	Chrisx1	if you want automatic DHCP configuration on boot, your /etc/network/interfaces should contain two lines
2005-12-09T13:03:00.000Z	mgedmin	Chrisx1	auto eth0
2005-12-09T13:03:00.000Z	mgedmin	Chrisx1	iface eth0 inet dhcp
2005-12-09T13:04:00.000Z	mgedmin	Chrisx1	do you want it to use the internet connection shared by a different machine, or do you want it to share its connection to other machines?
