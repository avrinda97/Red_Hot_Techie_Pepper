2008-02-03T14:17:00.000Z	Daz9		Is anyone good with PCs here?
2008-02-03T14:19:00.000Z	Daz9		OKay, anyone have any idea how I can turn off my HP pavillion dv6000 PC safe-ish, it's stuck on the log off screen and has been for 8 hours.
2008-02-03T14:19:00.000Z	nemilar	Daz9	just hit the power button ;)  or if you really want.... let me remember this
2008-02-03T14:19:00.000Z	nemilar	Daz9	h/o one second while I Try to remember this command
2008-02-03T14:20:00.000Z	nemilar	Daz9	well actually, before we head down that road, can you get to another TTY?
2008-02-03T14:21:00.000Z	nemilar	Daz9	usually control+alt+F4
2008-02-03T14:21:00.000Z	nemilar	Daz9	F1 through F6 should work, but it's usually a combo of Control, Alt, and Fn
2008-02-03T14:22:00.000Z	nemilar	Daz9	let me know if that happens... you will be taken to a text login screen if it does
2008-02-03T14:22:00.000Z	nemilar	Daz9	hmm donno
2008-02-03T14:22:00.000Z	nemilar	Daz9	doubt it
2008-02-03T14:23:00.000Z	nemilar	Daz9	now for the magic key combos....
2008-02-03T14:23:00.000Z	nemilar	Daz9	check out this page: http://mirzmaster.wordpress.com/2006/12/12/raising-skinny-elephants-is-utterly-boring/
2008-02-03T14:24:00.000Z	nemilar	Daz9	give it a few seconds in between each step
2008-02-03T14:24:00.000Z	nemilar	Daz9	that's a VERY old UNIX trick, haha
2008-02-03T14:26:00.000Z	nemilar	Daz9	after the 'b' command it should begin to reboot
2008-02-03T14:29:00.000Z	nemilar	Daz9	if the sysreq key is a function key or something, maybe yeah
2008-02-03T14:29:00.000Z	nemilar	Daz9	hard to say if linux even detected your keymap correctly
2008-02-03T14:31:00.000Z	nemilar	Daz9	any luck?
