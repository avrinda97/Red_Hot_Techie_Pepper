2008-03-05T03:03:00.000Z	tomtommy		how can I get OpenOffice to offer correctly spelled words for misspelled words?
2008-03-05T03:04:00.000Z	tomtommy		in MS Office it offers a correctly spelled word
2008-03-05T03:06:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	tomtommy	Does right-clicking the word do it?
2008-03-05T03:06:00.000Z	tomtommy	Odd-rationale	no, right click doesnt show any correct or alternate words
2008-03-05T03:06:00.000Z	tomtommy	Odd-rationale	any other ideas?
2008-03-05T03:07:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	tomtommy	Right-click- autocorrect ? Does it for me.
2008-03-05T03:07:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	tomtommy	Right-click --> autocorrect
2008-03-05T03:07:00.000Z	tomtommy	Odd-rationale	i dont see autocorrect when I right click
2008-03-05T03:08:00.000Z	tomtommy	Odd-rationale	how did you get autocorrect to appear as u right click?
2008-03-05T03:08:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	tomtommy	Are you right-clicking the word with the red squiggly?
2008-03-05T03:08:00.000Z	tomtommy	Odd-rationale	yes
2008-03-05T03:08:00.000Z	tomtommy	Odd-rationale	and this is  a newly installed Ubuntu, 2 days ago
2008-03-05T03:08:00.000Z	tomtommy	Odd-rationale	first time im running OO,  did u install something to get autocorrect to appear?
2008-03-05T03:09:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	tomtommy	No, it worked like that "right out of the box" try installing the OO dict for your language.
2008-03-05T03:11:00.000Z	tomtommy	Odd-rationale	i was highlithing the word first, thats why it gave a different menu :P
2008-03-05T03:13:00.000Z	tomtommy	Odd-rationale	did u see what I was doing wrong?
2008-03-05T03:13:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	tomtommy	Yes... ^_^
