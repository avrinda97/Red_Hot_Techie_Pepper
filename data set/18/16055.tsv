2004-11-21T12:31:00.000Z	crimsun	MasterYoda	Debian uses kernel-source*
2004-11-21T12:31:00.000Z	crimsun	MasterYoda	Ubuntu uses linux-source*
2004-11-21T12:31:00.000Z	MasterYoda	crimsun	yeah I saw that eairler, why the change?
2004-11-21T12:32:00.000Z	crimsun	MasterYoda	linux-source better describes it. There's a long thread from November of last year on debian-devel concerning it.
2004-11-21T12:32:00.000Z	MasterYoda	crimsun	I guess...
2004-11-21T12:32:00.000Z	MasterYoda	crimsun	is debian switching?
2004-11-21T12:32:00.000Z	crimsun	MasterYoda	things stagnate in Debian at times
2004-11-21T12:33:00.000Z	MasterYoda	crimsun	yeah I know...
2004-11-21T12:33:00.000Z	MasterYoda	crimsun	part of the reason there is so much time between releases
2004-11-21T12:34:00.000Z	crimsun	MasterYoda	overall, I don't expect a swift migration to the new naming (that Ubuntu has adopted smartly imo)
2004-11-21T12:34:00.000Z	MasterYoda	crimsun	I think debian should split into several branches, all pulling from the same unstable branch
2004-11-21T12:35:00.000Z	MasterYoda	crimsun	like a base system, and a desktop and a server
2004-11-21T12:36:00.000Z	MasterYoda	crimsun	desk and serve would release after base, base would have longer release cycles
2004-11-21T12:36:00.000Z	MasterYoda	crimsun	you get the idea
2005-11-08T16:44:00.000Z	crimsun	MasterYoda	is sshd (from openssh-server) running?
2005-11-08T16:51:00.000Z	MasterYoda	crimsun	yes sshd is running
2005-11-08T16:52:00.000Z	crimsun	MasterYoda	are you running iptables on that interface (lo)?
2005-11-08T16:52:00.000Z	MasterYoda	crimsun	don't think so, let me check
