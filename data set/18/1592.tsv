2011-01-23T03:08:00.000Z	mellin		Hi all I'm having an issue with my GeForce 360GM on a toshiba x505. I have the nvidia drivers installed. Already ran nvidia-xconfig. I don't get any video output to my external lcd monitor using HDMI cable
2011-01-23T03:10:00.000Z	mellin		I checked the nvidia settings and it shows both displays. I can't figure out how to get the 23"lcd to work? On boot I do see output booting with grub. Up to the point where I get a 10.10 splash with the dots. It stays there for a second then disappears. I hear the audio on the sytem. Just not video. How do I disable the laptop display and enable the other?
2011-01-23T03:11:00.000Z	x_	mellin	on ur laptop do you have an fn button ?
2011-01-23T03:11:00.000Z	mellin		Yes
2011-01-23T03:12:00.000Z	x_	mellin	well idk what it looks like on ur pc button on the top part do you have a button for changing to an external monitor
2011-01-23T03:12:00.000Z	mellin	x_	Yes...what keystroke do I need to try? They are listed as DFP-0 and DFP-1 in nvidia settings
