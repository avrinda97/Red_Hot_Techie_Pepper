2006-11-11T15:47:00.000Z	graeme		I'm building an older computer for a friend, does anyone have any suggestions for any cool apps that I can put on it ? ... he's a non-computer nerd type ...
2006-11-11T15:48:00.000Z	SilentDis	graeme	 how old?
2006-11-11T15:48:00.000Z	SilentDis	graeme	 the computer, not the friend.  ;)
2006-11-11T15:51:00.000Z	graeme	SilentDis	28 ...
2006-11-11T15:51:00.000Z	SilentDis	graeme	 lol
2006-11-11T15:51:00.000Z	SilentDis	graeme	 a 28 year old computer... and you're giving it away?  hmm... i can think of a couple doors I need propped open... *snicker*
2006-11-11T15:52:00.000Z	graeme	SilentDis	oh, no the friend is 28, the computer is P3 with 256MB ...
2006-11-11T15:53:00.000Z	SilentDis	graeme	 a P3 isn't too horrible... the memory is a bit low though (linux is ram-hungry, in most cases).  what drive size do you have in it?
2006-11-11T15:54:00.000Z	SilentDis	graeme	 no problems there then (was praying you didn't say 5gb).  and I'd agree with xarq, a lower system intensive distro would probably run better than ubuntu
2006-11-11T15:55:00.000Z	SilentDis	graeme	 that box is well-suited to e-mail, browsing, a little MP3 music, basic office work type of thing.
2006-11-11T15:57:00.000Z	SilentDis	graeme	 the biggest 'problem', if you can call it that, with ubuntu and kubuntu is gnome and kde are VERY memory intensive.  512 is a low level for most of the stuff, 1gb is probably recommended.  I'm doing barely nothing on my box right now and sucking 160mb away.
2006-11-11T15:58:00.000Z	SilentDis	graeme	 dropping another 256 stick in there would make it a bit better.  little slow on the 'uptake' as it were, but it would be bareable
2006-11-11T15:59:00.000Z	SilentDis	graeme	 you can try it, but I'd work your way through the install first, and see how it handles things post-install.  after that, xmms would be a good start.
2006-11-11T16:04:00.000Z	SilentDis	graeme	 i've eaten 2gb ram before, just doing webdev stuff.  thank god linux is nice about giving it back as you close stuff... unlike a certain *OTHER* operating system, which I won't mention :P
2006-11-11T16:07:00.000Z	SilentDis	graeme	 no root, normally.  you can sudo to root from your primary user account, should you need it
2006-11-11T16:08:00.000Z	graeme	SilentDis	yeah, but sudo isn't going to work for everything right ?
2006-11-11T16:08:00.000Z	SilentDis	graeme	 if you need an interactive root terminal, type sudo -i :)
2006-11-11T16:14:00.000Z	SilentDis	graeme	 on most installs I do for others, I create a new user account for them right away without access to sudo.  they have to purposly log in as their 'super user' account in order to mess things up.  gives them pause before they do it ;)
