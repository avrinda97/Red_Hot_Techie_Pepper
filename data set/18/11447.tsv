2006-08-08T13:48:00.000Z	davegoodson	citizen	it doesnt even show up on the list of wireless networks, even if i set the router to show its ssid
2006-08-08T13:48:00.000Z	citizen	davegoodson	is there a button on your machine to enable the wireless card?
2006-08-08T13:48:00.000Z	citizen		well, do other networks show up?
2006-08-08T13:48:00.000Z	davegoodson		yep
2006-08-08T13:49:00.000Z	citizen	davegoodson	do you have MAC filtering on your router?
2006-08-08T13:49:00.000Z	davegoodson		yep, but ive allowed the wireless's mac
2006-08-08T13:50:00.000Z	citizen	davegoodson	disable it, and then try. I had troubles with MAC filtering, and had to disable it
2006-08-08T13:50:00.000Z	citizen		!ask
2006-08-08T13:50:00.000Z	davegoodson		i think thats done it :) thanks
2006-08-08T13:51:00.000Z	citizen		no problem, davegoodson
2006-08-08T13:51:00.000Z	davegoodson	citizen	but why does it do that? i'd prefer to have mac filtering on :)
2006-08-08T13:52:00.000Z	citizen		yes, i like it too, but maybe nm-applet just doesn't supprt it with some routes/cards. i'm sure there will be more supprt in the next release
2006-08-08T13:52:00.000Z	citizen	davegoodson	i just hide my SSID, and "connect to other network"
