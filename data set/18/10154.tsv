2007-01-12T06:44:00.000Z	phixnay		hey, where can I get information on improving edgy's boot time?
2007-01-12T06:45:00.000Z	phixnay		mine takes a minute or so
2007-01-12T06:46:00.000Z	phixnay		GNOME, so is that nautilus?
2007-01-12T06:46:00.000Z	phixnay		I'll get bootmanager
2007-01-12T06:47:00.000Z	phixnay		it slows down the most after I choose it from grub, and at the splash screen
2007-01-12T06:49:00.000Z	phixnay		I'm getting bootchart - I think probably what slows it down most are the PCI errors I get
2007-01-12T06:51:00.000Z	phixnay		also do you know why synaptic downloads things at around 3000 B/s, but I've done a speed test that rated it 180 k/s
2007-01-12T06:52:00.000Z	adaptr	phixnay	choose better mirrors :)
2007-01-12T06:52:00.000Z	phixnay	adaptr	ah, which are you using? I'm on the defaults
2007-01-12T06:54:00.000Z	adaptr	phixnay	use whatever is closest to you, geographically
2007-01-12T06:54:00.000Z	adaptr	phixnay	and i do
2007-01-12T06:55:00.000Z	phixnay	adaptr	where do I change the mirror? sources.list?
2007-01-12T06:56:00.000Z	adaptr	phixnay	system -> admin -> software sources is a graphical interface, but yes - source.lst
2007-01-20T06:18:00.000Z	adaptr	phixnay	no, but you do need the C build environment
2007-01-20T06:19:00.000Z	adaptr	phixnay	and you also have linux-headers installed ?
2007-01-20T06:22:00.000Z	adaptr	phixnay	uname -r
2007-01-20T06:25:00.000Z	adaptr	phixnay	what are you trying to build ? if it's a 32-bit app then you need 32-bit libraries, 32-bit DEV libraries, and 32-bit headers
2007-01-20T06:27:00.000Z	adaptr	phixnay	what do you mean, "what libraries" ? all of them, of course - glibc, kernel, whatever else the app needs
