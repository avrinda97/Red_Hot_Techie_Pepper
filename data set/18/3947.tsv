2009-07-01T05:50:00.000Z	uniquebob		I need to try wubi
2009-07-01T05:50:00.000Z	sebsebseb	uniquebob	why do you think that?
2009-07-01T05:52:00.000Z	sebsebseb	uniquebob	yeah  many Ubuntu newbies use it,  but most  experienced users will avoide it :)
2009-07-01T05:52:00.000Z	sebsebseb	uniquebob	it's  usaully always better to do a proper partitioned install :)
2009-07-01T05:53:00.000Z	uniquebob	sebsebseb	I know, and thats what I do. Newbs don't leave space for new o/s, and they often don't have the tools to migrate easily.
2009-07-01T05:53:00.000Z	uniquebob	sebsebseb	mostly i feel guilty because i didn't know what wubi does, and I tried helping someone who used the 'ubuntu installer'....
2009-07-01T05:54:00.000Z	sebsebseb	uniquebob	well  Ubuntu in a virtual machine inside Windows, is better than Wubi,   and  that was coming from someone who thinks  Windows is a bad  host OS for virtual machines
2009-07-01T05:54:00.000Z	sebsebseb	uniquebob	Wubi  puts Ubuntu  in a section of the Windows partition
2009-07-01T05:55:00.000Z	sebsebseb	uniquebob	A  Gentoo  user, that wants to use Wubi   is this a joke?
2009-07-01T05:56:00.000Z	sebsebseb	uniquebob	do a partitioned install :)  I would have thought as a Gentoo user,  you would know that it's usaully better :)
2009-07-01T05:56:00.000Z	uniquebob	sebsebseb	ubuntu = gentoo rehab. And yeah, I want to help people. I'm on the front lines of GPL education more often than not, and I'd like to know whats out there.
2009-07-01T05:57:00.000Z	sebsebseb	uniquebob	well  find a distro that you like, put that on as host, and  virtual machine other stuff,  assuming you have enough RAM
2009-07-01T05:58:00.000Z	uniquebob	sebsebseb	no I want to know why wubi sucks. And I have a game plan for all my o/s needs.
2009-07-01T05:59:00.000Z	sebsebseb	uniquebob	Wubi can sometimes  be useful,  it depends on  the computer set up, and who it bellongs to, but most of the time,  it's best to avoide it.
2009-07-01T06:00:00.000Z	sebsebseb	uniquebob	ask coleys :)
2009-07-01T06:05:00.000Z	sebsebseb	uniquebob	 what Flannel said,  but being able to run two or more OS's at once is :) so  virtual machines rather than Wubi
2009-07-01T06:06:00.000Z	sebsebseb	uniquebob	of course no good if on 256MB RAM for VM's  since it won't work
2009-07-01T06:06:00.000Z	sebsebseb	uniquebob	and partitining isn't that difficult
