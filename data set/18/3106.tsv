2010-02-16T22:40:00.000Z	DasEi	Homely_Girl	video-lan-codec I think, see :
2010-02-16T22:40:00.000Z	DasEi	Homely_Girl	it's a player apart from others in that way, it brings a bunch of own codecs, even exotic ones
2010-02-16T22:41:00.000Z	Homely_Girl	DasEi	U my hero of the day! :) Will it let me save it into somming windoze friendly?
2010-02-16T22:42:00.000Z	DasEi	Homely_Girl	first check if you can play it
2010-02-16T22:43:00.000Z	Homely_Girl	DasEi	will do, ta.
2010-02-16T22:43:00.000Z	DasEi	Homely_Girl	vlc itself doesn't convert, but might give more usefull info about filetype
2010-02-16T22:44:00.000Z	DasEi	Homely_Girl	there are good converters, if not, can use audacity to re-record it and save as wav or other win-compatible, most can b converted (if playable at all)
2010-02-16T22:44:00.000Z	Homely_Girl	DasEi	woosh!! But thanks...may email it to a geek friend 'n let him sort it! Thanks gonna see if it works now. :)
2010-02-16T22:46:00.000Z	DasEi	Homely_Girl	if vlc plays it, are on it
