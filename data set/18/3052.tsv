2009-12-23T17:30:00.000Z	nitsckie		sorry for intruding but can someone help with a problem i have with my ubuntu?
2009-12-23T17:32:00.000Z	_scavenger_	nitsckie	Of course.
2009-12-23T17:32:00.000Z	_scavenger_	nitsckie	No error messages or anything?
2009-12-23T17:33:00.000Z	_scavenger_	nitsckie	No HDD activity either?
2009-12-23T17:33:00.000Z	_scavenger_	nitsckie	Hit Control+Alt+F1 through F8 - does it say anything out of the ordinary?
2009-12-23T17:35:00.000Z	_scavenger_	nitsckie	And the other ones?
2009-12-23T17:36:00.000Z	_scavenger_	nitsckie	And none of the TTYs give anything, except for a mysterious blue/green line on TTY 1?
2009-12-23T17:37:00.000Z	_scavenger_	nitsckie	Sorry. If you hit Control + Alt + one of the F keys, you open a TTY.
2009-12-23T17:38:00.000Z	_scavenger_	nitsckie	The other ones are black?
2009-12-23T17:38:00.000Z	_scavenger_	nitsckie	Mysterious. Do you have an Ubuntu CD lying around?
2009-12-23T17:40:00.000Z	_scavenger_	nitsckie	You could try booting from it, opening your hard drive from Places > Computer, and looking at /var/log/bott.msg
2009-12-23T17:40:00.000Z	_scavenger_	nitsckie	*boot.msg
2009-12-23T17:40:00.000Z	nitsckie	_scavenger_	will do that right now
2009-12-23T17:47:00.000Z	nitsckie	_scavenger_	that file just stated "Nothing has been looged yet"
2009-12-23T17:47:00.000Z	_scavenger_	nitsckie	You might want to start a thread about this on the Ubuntu forum.
2009-12-23T17:48:00.000Z	_scavenger_	nitsckie	Include your full system specs and stuff.
2009-12-23T17:57:00.000Z	_scavenger_	nitsckie	I prefer VirtualBox.
