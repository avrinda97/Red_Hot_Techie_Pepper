2008-05-25T15:00:00.000Z	bazhang	yit4s	what are you trying (ie how)
2008-05-25T15:01:00.000Z	yit4s	bazhang	i need an add-on and it is incompatible with firefox 3. so i installed firefox 2 but i get unexpected error when installing, refer error console
2008-05-25T15:01:00.000Z	bazhang	yit4s	which one
2008-05-25T15:02:00.000Z	yit4s	bazhang	the add-on is unplug
2008-05-25T15:02:00.000Z	bazhang	yit4s	the name is 'unplug'? what does it do
2008-05-25T15:03:00.000Z	yit4s	bazhang	umm download videos from sites
2008-05-25T15:03:00.000Z	yit4s	bazhang	the error console tells me something about extension manager
2008-05-25T15:03:00.000Z	bazhang	yit4s	there a bunch of ff3 compatible ones that do that--if you search in add-ons page they will show up.
2008-05-25T15:04:00.000Z	yit4s	bazhang	sudo aptitude firefox-2
2008-05-25T15:04:00.000Z	bazhang	yit4s	those two (ff2 + ff3) will conflict without some serious cli magic
2008-05-27T11:29:00.000Z	bazhang	yit4s	what happens when you sudo dhclient wlan0 (or nic name)
2008-05-27T12:08:00.000Z	yit4s	bazhang	so wanna help me? :D
2008-06-13T12:46:00.000Z	bazhang	yit4s	no idea
