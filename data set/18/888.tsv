2011-08-06T19:45:00.000Z	minaaa		i am still here without receiving any help. let me repeat for the last time? CAN ANYONE HELP ME CONFIGURE MY 3G MODEM WITH USB_MODESWITCH?
2011-08-06T19:46:00.000Z	ksx4system	minaaa	i remember that on Debian usb_modeswitch was NOT needed on newer (afair 2.6.32+) kernels
2011-08-06T19:47:00.000Z	ksx4system		minaa: so, what kernel do you run? (uname -a to check) which version of Ubuntu (number please)?
2011-08-06T19:47:00.000Z	minaaa		zeik: i used chmod +x on it but it asks me for product id or device id for the 3g modem to be entered as parameter which i do not know
2011-08-06T19:47:00.000Z	minaaa	ksx4system	i am using ubuntu 10.10
2011-08-06T19:49:00.000Z	minaaa		when i insert the 3g modem it shows up as cd drive on windows but it doesnt get detected as a cd drive either in ubuntu
2011-08-06T19:49:00.000Z	ksx4system	minaaa	afaics you run 2.6.35 kernel. most popular in Europe 3G modems should run perfectly even with bare bones wvdial
2011-08-06T19:49:00.000Z	minaaa		zeik: it is a hsdpa modem named visiontek
2011-08-06T19:50:00.000Z	minaaa		let me give u all a picture of the 3g modem
2011-08-06T19:50:00.000Z	ksx4system	minaaa	cool, i can't even check what chipset it has... manufacturer's website is down
2011-08-06T19:51:00.000Z	minaaa		its named visiontek
2011-08-06T19:51:00.000Z	minaaa		the modem has a picture here http://images02.olx.in/ui/10/93/38/1293439681_151038538_1-Visiontek-3G-Modem-new-ones-for-sale-with-1Year-warranty-Vizianagaram.jpg
2011-08-06T19:52:00.000Z	minaaa		tried usb_modeswitch with several params but it isnt a sierra or huawei. the modeswitch software is probably made for those modems
2011-08-06T19:53:00.000Z	minaaa	ksx4system	their crappy website is here http://www.visiontek.co.in/3g-2g-wireless-products/82gh.html
2011-08-06T19:53:00.000Z	minaaa		zeik: cant it work in linux?
2011-08-06T19:54:00.000Z	minaaa		zeik: i am on ubuntu 10.10
2011-08-06T19:54:00.000Z	ksx4system	minaaa	unreachable for me and/or down :( i'll check out picture you've linked to
2011-08-06T19:55:00.000Z	minaaa	ksx4system	probably the indian company is geoblocking users. what a bad policy
