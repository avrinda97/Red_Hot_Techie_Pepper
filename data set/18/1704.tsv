2011-01-22T03:38:00.000Z	KeyLimePi		Anyone here use Ubuntu 10.04 in 64-bit?
2011-01-22T03:38:00.000Z	KeyLimePi		Have you had any issues with the flash player when using a browser?
2011-01-22T03:40:00.000Z	KeyLimePi		Yeah.  Im having issues using webcam in flash based chat rooms.  It seems that even though my camera is good, I get this sort of strange interlacing on it
2011-01-22T03:40:00.000Z	KeyLimePi		but when I use the camera function in Google Talk (also through the browser but through thier tech), the pic is  great
2011-01-22T03:40:00.000Z	mongy	KeyLimePi	Im 10.10 64bit and use flash (32bit) with no real problems.. there is a 64bit flash plugin if you google 64bit flash ppa, but its not final.
2011-01-22T03:40:00.000Z	KeyLimePi		Yeah, I tried version and non solve the problem (64-bit)
2011-01-22T03:41:00.000Z	mongy	KeyLimePi	what problems?
2011-01-22T03:41:00.000Z	KeyLimePi		I have the thread I put in this morning.  http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1672309
2011-01-22T03:42:00.000Z	KeyLimePi		funny is that I did not have this kind of problem 2 weeks ago but then, I have done some package updates since then.
2011-01-22T03:44:00.000Z	mongy	KeyLimePi	sorry, Im not really the person to ask I guess...  I only use flash when I have to...
2011-01-22T03:44:00.000Z	KeyLimePi		Yeah.  Same here but I was hoping to get my quality back up to par
2011-01-22T03:45:00.000Z	KeyLimePi		because sadly, I rely on a site which has chosen flash for the browser interface. I wish I knew what Gtalk's in-browser cam tool uses since my webcam image quality is so much better
2011-01-22T03:47:00.000Z	KeyLimePi		any idea where I might find previous versions of flash player which work with Lucid (10.04) and 64-bit.  My only guess is that I need to roll back a few sub versions
2011-01-22T03:49:00.000Z	KeyLimePi	mongy	what version of flash player do you have?
2011-01-22T03:50:00.000Z	mongy	KeyLimePi	latest 32bit from repo
2011-01-22T03:50:00.000Z	KeyLimePi	mongy	do you have a 64-bit system?
2011-01-22T03:50:00.000Z	mongy	KeyLimePi	I only use it when its really needed.  html5 for youtube when it can, and I guess crappy flash for everything else
2011-01-22T03:50:00.000Z	mongy	KeyLimePi	yes
