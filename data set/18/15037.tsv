2005-05-14T10:41:00.000Z	metalsand2		but I guess I have to configure them, and i don't even know where to begin with doing that
2005-05-14T10:41:00.000Z	metalsand2		wlan0... jord, there is nothing listed as that
2005-05-14T10:42:00.000Z	metalsand2		My only devices listed in network settings are eth0 (My internal wireless card), eth1 (My uncofigured network inteface card) and eth2 (my PCMCIA card)
2005-05-14T10:42:00.000Z	metalsand2		None of them work
2005-05-14T10:42:00.000Z	metalsand2		When I try to boot it just stalls on *Confiruging network interfaces for minutes
2005-05-14T10:44:00.000Z	metalsand2		I've had it working before
2005-05-14T10:46:00.000Z	metalsand2		Ugh
2005-05-14T10:48:00.000Z	metalsand2		What Ubuntu just destroy my drivers for my card?
2005-05-14T10:48:00.000Z	metalsand2		I don't get why it woudln't work
2005-05-14T10:48:00.000Z	metalsand2		It just stopped...
2005-05-14T10:48:00.000Z	karsten	metalsand2	I think you made that point an hour or two ago.
2005-05-14T10:49:00.000Z	karsten	metalsand2	Why don't you call it a night, buy a USB pen drive, and come back tomorrow.
2005-05-14T10:50:00.000Z	karsten	metalsand2	Call it a night and chill, dude.
2005-05-14T10:55:00.000Z	karsten	metalsand2	There's a few things here which may come as some solace.  Among them, Linux doesn't tend to randomly reorganize itself from out from under you.
2005-05-14T10:56:00.000Z	metalsand2	karsten	What does solace mean?
2005-05-14T11:00:00.000Z	karsten	metalsand2	What's wrong with SoCal is not enough rain, earthquakes, fires, or landslides.
2005-05-14T11:00:00.000Z	karsten	metalsand2	My point exactlyu.
2005-05-14T11:01:00.000Z	karsten	metalsand2	Who's sarcastic?
