2006-08-01T10:49:00.000Z	jordan__	stefg	Ok I have Tried Going To Google And UbuntuForums And Could not figre it out. I have A Wireless Rougher (Motorola SBG-900) And a Cable Modem Toshiba) But the Modem is in My Kitchen SO i cant Connect But i need internet connection Sharing. I Have a Usb, Telephone Port And a Lan Port. Thats It..
2006-08-01T10:49:00.000Z	jordan__	stefg	The site said to ask better questions so.
2006-08-01T10:50:00.000Z	stefg	jordan__	i'm delighted to see it had an effect :-)
2006-08-01T10:50:00.000Z	jordan__	stefg	:)
2006-08-01T10:52:00.000Z	stefg	jordan__	so the point is that the router is the common junction point of your network... dont connect the PCs to each other, but connect each PC to the router
2006-08-01T10:52:00.000Z	stefg	jordan__	this can be done by copper cable or via wireless
2006-08-01T10:53:00.000Z	jordan__	stefg	What copper cable. (But i cant connect To the rougher other than wireless without moving my Pc's And the rougter.
2006-08-01T10:54:00.000Z	stefg	jordan__	so connect to the router wireless, and move the router if it's required by the locality
2006-08-01T10:55:00.000Z	jordan__	stefg	well im confused by that last one. The only problem is im not the only one using it. But i could move it. How do i connect directly to it?
2006-08-01T10:58:00.000Z	stefg	jordan__	see, the problem is that you try to establish a segmented network without knowing the basics about TCP/IP networking...  there's a physical side involved (all PCs have to be connected to the router directly, may it be by cable or wireless) and a logical one... subnets divided by the the third octet in the IP adress. This is beyond the scope of this channel, I'm sorry
2006-08-01T10:59:00.000Z	jordan__	stefg	Thats ok. I Will have to keep Trying
2006-08-01T10:59:00.000Z	stefg	jordan__	let me see if i can give you some links
2006-08-01T11:02:00.000Z	stefg	jordan__	http://www.netfilter.org/documentation/HOWTO/networking-concepts-HOWTO.html
2006-08-01T11:04:00.000Z	jordan__	stefg	I Just realized. I have accsess to a crossover cable.
2006-08-01T11:07:00.000Z	stefg	jordan__	then be aware that you need to forward the packets from the connected box to the unconnected one..  http://rob.pectol.com/content/view/3/1/ will help you to set that up
