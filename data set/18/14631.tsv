2008-05-03T13:21:00.000Z	DrinkBeer		MrDownTempo Did you try installing drivers with envyNG?
2008-05-03T13:21:00.000Z	DrinkBeer		or envy if you r on gutsy or older
2008-05-03T13:22:00.000Z	DrinkBeer		o lol
2008-05-03T13:22:00.000Z	DrinkBeer		I got the driver working with a 9800 series
2008-05-03T13:22:00.000Z	DrinkBeer		but thats about it
2008-05-03T13:22:00.000Z	DrinkBeer		You kinda have to trick it
2008-05-03T13:22:00.000Z	DrinkBeer		install the restricted and then use envy
2008-05-03T13:22:00.000Z	DrinkBeer		why i dunno but it killed all the bugs i had
2008-05-03T13:24:00.000Z	DrinkBeer		tag it might be an evolution setting since evo is tied to gnome
2008-05-03T13:24:00.000Z	DrinkBeer		the update might have overwrote the files
2008-05-03T13:24:00.000Z	tag	DrinkBeer	yeah I've dug around forever and never found it.
2008-05-03T13:24:00.000Z	tag	DrinkBeer	it seems to be something deeper.  I've also dug around gconf -- but never found them
2008-05-03T13:24:00.000Z	tag	DrinkBeer	I'd assume this would be a user level thing, but I'm unsure.
2008-05-03T13:25:00.000Z	tag	DrinkBeer	gnome is not tied to the OS.
2008-05-03T13:25:00.000Z	tag	DrinkBeer	and evolution is not tied to the for that matter, either.
2008-05-03T13:27:00.000Z	tag	DrinkBeer	that's just configuration -- and it's all user level.
2008-05-03T13:27:00.000Z	tag	DrinkBeer	it's just, there is a big user-level template that gets added.
2008-05-03T13:28:00.000Z	tag	DrinkBeer	sunbird doesn't work with exchange
