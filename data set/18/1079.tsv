2011-06-10T18:27:00.000Z	pfifo	thisismygame	boot with nomodeset option enabled
2011-06-10T18:56:00.000Z	thisismygame	pfifo	where should i put nomodeset? at the very end of the grub command?
2011-06-10T18:57:00.000Z	pfifo	thisismygame	yeah on the kernel line
2011-06-10T18:59:00.000Z	thisismygame	pfifo	so I have initrd /initrd.img-2.6.38-8-generic nomodeset
2011-06-10T18:59:00.000Z	pfifo	thisismygame	nope, thats the initrd line, add it before the -- on the previous line
2011-06-10T19:00:00.000Z	thisismygame	pfifo	pardon my nooblery
2011-06-10T19:00:00.000Z	pfifo	thisismygame	np
2011-06-10T19:00:00.000Z	thisismygame	pfifo	bingo
2011-06-10T19:02:00.000Z	thisismygame	pfifo	thank you very much sir. so I'll just edit my grub line to have "nomodeset" on it
2011-06-10T19:02:00.000Z	pfifo	thisismygame	dont forget that, youll need it al the time
2011-06-10T19:02:00.000Z	thisismygame	pfifo	why is that? i dont have video drivers installed yet, i'm guessing.
2011-06-10T19:03:00.000Z	pfifo	thisismygame	the kernel is now responsible for setting the video mode, however the older drivers still think its taken care of by X
