2010-05-13T02:17:00.000Z	ldleworker		Anyone know how to tell Ubuntu to stop freaking out about having to have su privledges to run things that use port 80?
2010-05-13T02:18:00.000Z	Brandano	ldleworker	run it with the proper user and group
2010-05-13T02:18:00.000Z	ldleworker	Brandano	is that like www or something?
2010-05-13T02:18:00.000Z	Brandano	ldleworker	yep, I think it's the www group, but I have to check
2010-05-13T02:19:00.000Z	ldleworker	Brandano	I don't have a pre-existing www, group.
2010-05-13T02:20:00.000Z	Brandano	ldleworker	what are you running on port 80, btw? just httpd?
2010-05-13T02:20:00.000Z	ldleworker		Django test server.
2010-05-13T02:20:00.000Z	ldleworker		@ Brandano
2010-05-13T02:21:00.000Z	Brandano	ldleworker	hold on, I am sshing on another box to check the config there
2010-05-13T02:21:00.000Z	ldleworker	Brandano	gratzi
2010-05-13T02:22:00.000Z	Brandano	ldleworker	it's www-data
2010-05-13T02:22:00.000Z	ldleworker	Brandano	even if that group doesn't exist?
2010-05-13T02:22:00.000Z	Brandano		at least lighthttpd runs on the www-data group
2010-05-13T02:22:00.000Z	ldleworker		Its like "expecting" it anyway?
2010-05-13T02:22:00.000Z	ldleworker		I see.
2010-05-13T02:23:00.000Z	Brandano	ldleworker	I am not sure how the group is created. I'd try it first by just creating the www-data group, and if that isn't enough I'd install and remove an http servere. Either apache or lighthttpd
2010-05-13T02:24:00.000Z	Brandano	ldleworker	you may even just want to keep the webserver anyway, since it will work better for static data. And you can reverse proxy on django
2010-05-13T02:24:00.000Z	ldleworker	Brandano	heh, at some point I'll learn apache ;)
