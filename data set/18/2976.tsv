2010-01-11T00:26:00.000Z	ATI-Frustration	Jordan_U	Misha: true that. I had this message once. I fixed it by trying combinations in /boot/grub/menu.lst  at the part:  " root            (hd0,0)"   those 0,0 numbers. I made them be  (hd0,1) or (hd1,0)   but I can't rememner now.
2010-01-11T00:27:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ATI-Frustration	Removeing fglrx should get you back to where you were before
2010-01-11T00:28:00.000Z	ATI-Frustration	Jordan_U	in /etc/X11/xorg.conf there's no seting to load fglrx though.
2010-01-11T00:29:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ATI-Frustration	Not sure if it's still true, but it used to be that nvidia and fglrx would break loading of the Free drivers as well
2010-01-11T00:29:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ATI-Frustration	Have you tried actually loading fglrx though?
2010-01-11T00:29:00.000Z	ATI-Frustration	Jordan_U	or better formulated, how to instruct the kernel NOT to load fglrx ?
2010-01-11T00:30:00.000Z	ATI-Frustration	Jordan_U	at the xorg.log file I can see it loads fglrx
2010-01-11T00:31:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ATI-Frustration	Then add a device section with: Driver    "ati"
2010-01-11T00:31:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ATI-Frustration	Or, again, just remove the xorg-driver-fglrx package
2010-01-11T00:32:00.000Z	ATI-Frustration	Jordan_U	correction. The messages indicate that "dri" is loaded and also "glx" is loaded, but there's nothing about fglrx
2010-01-11T00:33:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ATI-Frustration	Either try adding 'Driver    "fglrx"' or try removing xorg-driver-fglrx
2010-01-11T00:33:00.000Z	ATI-Frustration	Jordan_U	I will see to add the driver line and then I'll be back. Thanks for the hint
2010-01-11T00:33:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ATI-Frustration	If you use System > Administrarion > Hardware Drivers it will edit the Xorg.conf for you
2010-01-11T00:35:00.000Z	ATI-Frustration	Jordan_U	That says there's no proprietary drives in use though, its empty. I'll see what happens with the Driver line
2010-01-11T00:36:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ATI-Frustration	That probably meanst that your card is not supported by fglrx, but you can try anyway
2010-01-11T01:02:00.000Z	ATI-Frustration	Jordan_U	well I don't know how to use much the grub-menu. :(
2010-01-11T01:03:00.000Z	ATI-Frustration	Jordan_U	by the way, removing that package did solve my problem. Now is all good and the eye candy works too ^^
