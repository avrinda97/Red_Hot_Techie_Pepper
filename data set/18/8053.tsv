2010-01-09T02:45:00.000Z	keanu		hey guys - I had a failed hard drive, so i was booting off my USB drive for a while. got my new HDD back today, and right after installing it, went to boot off of my flash drive again
2010-01-09T02:46:00.000Z	yeason	keanu	check your boot options in your bios
2010-01-09T02:47:00.000Z	keanu	yeason	checked, but I think it's worse - booted from another flash drive (4GB) without a problem, and plugged my original flash drive (16GB) in
2010-01-09T02:49:00.000Z	yeason	keanu	I'm not sure I follow what your problem is. What exactly do you need it to do and what is it doing in reality?
2010-01-09T02:50:00.000Z	keanu	yeason	I need it to appear in lsusb and, well, mount. instead, dmesg is showing http://pastebin.ca/1743257 , the flash drive's usb is either blinking steady but moderately fast, or steady and rather slow
2010-01-09T02:52:00.000Z	yeason	keanu	ok, I'm not sure I'll be able to help you. I am wondering though, have you verified this drive works with another computer/OS?
2010-01-09T02:54:00.000Z	keanu	yeason	I tried it in another laptop running vista - it recognizes that a usb drive was attached, but then gives the "USB device not recognized" error
2010-01-09T02:55:00.000Z	yeason	keanu	sounds like there's either a problem with the drive itself or perhaps it hasn't been formatted. Do other usb drives work with ubuntu?
2010-01-09T02:56:00.000Z	keanu	yeason	 yeah, i'm booting off of another usb drive now. i know it's formatted/partitioned, since i was using it earlier today
2010-01-09T02:57:00.000Z	yeason	keanu	You may be booted from one but can you plug in and mount another usb drive you know to be working(verified with another computer)?
2010-01-09T02:58:00.000Z	yeason	keanu	if you have trouble with this drive in another OS that means the problem is most likely with that drive. Thus we want to be sure by checking if a different drive does work
2010-01-09T03:00:00.000Z	keanu	yeason	those are the only two flash drives i can find at the moment
2010-01-09T03:01:00.000Z	yeason	keanu	ok, from the sounds of it I'm inclined to think there's a problem with your flash drive, not with ubuntu.
2010-01-09T03:01:00.000Z	keanu	yeason	yeah, i agree - have any tips for somehow recovering the data from the flash drive?
2010-01-09T03:03:00.000Z	yeason	keanu	Since it doesn't appear to be showing up under /dev I don't know of anything you can do.
2010-01-09T03:04:00.000Z	keanu	yeason	yeah, i'm kind of thinking the same =/
2010-01-09T03:05:00.000Z	yeason	keanu	sorry to tell you that... I hate it when I have drives crap out. I've got to go afk for a bit, if you need further assistance someone else might be able to help you out
2010-01-09T03:05:00.000Z	keanu	yeason	ok, thanks
