2008-11-17T18:14:00.000Z	Mythril		I have a usb hard drive that shows up in gparted as being completely unallocated, but it mounts just fine as a fat32 partition, I am confused as all hell, any suggestions on how to reconcile the differences?
2008-11-17T18:15:00.000Z	soundray	Mythril	perhaps it's not partitioned?
2008-11-17T18:16:00.000Z	Mythril	soundray	how can that be? it is fat32?
2008-11-17T18:16:00.000Z	soundray	Mythril	how are you mounting it?
2008-11-17T18:17:00.000Z	soundray	Mythril	what's the corresponding line in the output of 'mount'?
2008-11-17T18:18:00.000Z	Mythril	soundray	/dev/sdb1 on /media/SEA_DISK type vfat (rw,nosuid,nodev,uhelper=hal,shortname=mixed,uid=1000,utf8,umask=077,flush)
2008-11-17T18:18:00.000Z	soundray	Mythril	did you start gparted with gksudo?
2008-11-17T18:19:00.000Z	Mythril	soundray	yeah, I chose it from the administration menu
2008-11-17T18:21:00.000Z	soundray	Mythril	does 'sudo cfdisk /dev/sdb' show a partition table?
2008-11-17T18:21:00.000Z	Mythril	soundray	   sdb1                    Primary   Linux                           300066.44
2008-11-17T18:22:00.000Z	soundray	Mythril	so cfdisk sees the partition table, but gparted doesn't -- that's strange
2008-11-17T18:22:00.000Z	soundray	Mythril	what were you going to do with gparted on this drive?
2008-11-17T18:23:00.000Z	Mythril	soundray	what I find stranger is that cfdisk says it is a 'linux' partition, but mount claims to have mounted it as vfat
2008-11-17T18:23:00.000Z	Mythril	soundray	actually I was trying to figure out why it wouldn't mount in windows
2008-11-17T18:24:00.000Z	Mythril	soundray	because windows has... nothing for tools in that regard
2008-11-17T18:24:00.000Z	soundray	Mythril	trust mount. What cfdisk shows is just a label. If you change the label to 0b or 0c, it will mount in Windows.
2008-11-17T18:25:00.000Z	soundray	Mythril	hit 't' in cfdisk to change the partition type, then select 0c (probably), then write and reboot.
2008-11-17T18:27:00.000Z	Mythril	soundray	thnks that fixed it
