2007-03-13T10:15:00.000Z	Anabelle		can i limit my internet connection speed to 5ks?
2007-03-13T10:16:00.000Z	Anabelle		Can i limit the speed of my internet connection using kubuntu?
2007-03-13T10:18:00.000Z	Anabelle		are my messages being read?
2007-03-13T10:18:00.000Z	Anabelle		i feel like talking alone
2007-03-13T10:19:00.000Z	Anabelle		yes, i have an old laptop downloading stuff all the time, and it's eating up my bandwith, i use two other boxes
2007-03-13T10:19:00.000Z	Anabelle		i just want to "cap" the laptop
2007-03-13T10:21:00.000Z	Anabelle		i dont think so, the program is the konsole
2007-03-13T10:23:00.000Z	Anabelle		am i looking for an impossible?
2007-03-13T10:24:00.000Z	shatrat	Anabelle	well, if you cant limit the speed used by the program, you can use a traffic shaper to limit traffic, but im not familiar with them
2007-03-13T10:24:00.000Z	shatrat	Anabelle	but if youre using bit torrent or something lots of clients will let you limit the bandwith up and down
2007-03-13T10:28:00.000Z	shatrat	Anabelle	its a type of program, yes. I imagine there is something appropriate in the repos but I dont know anything about it.
2007-03-13T10:34:00.000Z	shatrat	Anabelle	well, at least you can drink good coffee while youre waiting for them to fix the connection.
2007-03-13T10:34:00.000Z	shatrat	Anabelle	is there any way to get your own ruter and use the modem just as a modem?
2007-03-13T10:35:00.000Z	shatrat	Anabelle	you could even set up one of your linux boxes as a router if it has enough ethernet cards or you have a switch.
2007-03-13T10:40:00.000Z	shatrat	Anabelle	bit torrent automatically checksums the completed file and checks for corruption.  HTTP has some error detection b/c of TCP but its more likely to be corrupt than bit torrent
2007-03-13T10:41:00.000Z	shatrat	Anabelle	although as tp_g said it might be that you were burning too fast, I burn at 2x always
2007-03-13T10:46:00.000Z	shatrat	Anabelle	it's not something most people want to do.  When im downloading everybody else just has to deal with it.
