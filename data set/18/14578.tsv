2005-10-18T14:42:00.000Z	Tyler		i cant get 3d working, its on mesa, i installed the ati drivers and configured them, it says ati in xorg.conf and i set it to ati in dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2005-10-18T14:42:00.000Z	topyli	Tyler	the ati driver is the open source one. you probably want fglrx or whatever it is
2005-10-18T14:43:00.000Z	Tyler		no i installed my ati dirvers off ati.com
2005-10-18T14:43:00.000Z	topyli	Tyler	but you're not using it
2005-10-18T14:43:00.000Z	Tyler		i also installed fglrx btw from synpatic
2005-10-18T14:43:00.000Z	Tyler	topyli	so how do i use it?
2005-10-18T14:44:00.000Z	topyli	Tyler	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg. then choose the fglrx driver when asked, otherwise keep hitting enter
2005-10-18T14:44:00.000Z	Tyler	topyli	last time i had ati i chose ATi off that list and it worked fine, why do i need to choose fglrx?
2005-10-18T14:45:00.000Z	topyli	Tyler	that's the proprietary, accelerated driver. it may be broken at any time, be aware of that, but that's the way with some video chip manufacturers who don't contribute free drivers for us
2005-10-18T14:46:00.000Z	Tyler		grr i cantg get my ati dirvers to work, its set on mesa for some reas
2005-10-18T14:46:00.000Z	Tyler		reason*
2005-10-18T14:49:00.000Z	Tyler		how can i prevent it from saying its mesa? i installed the ati drivers right and set it to ati in dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg and installed all the fglrx stuff off synaptic
2005-10-18T14:49:00.000Z	topyli	Tyler	which card do you have? my radeon 9200 on my work box freezes the whole box with the fglrx driver
2005-10-18T14:50:00.000Z	Tyler	topyli	i have a radeon 9200 as well
2005-10-18T14:50:00.000Z	Tyler	topyli	i just tried the fglrx and it still says its mesa
2005-10-18T14:50:00.000Z	topyli	Tyler	you're luckier than i am, my box is unusable if i boot x with this driver :)
2005-10-18T14:51:00.000Z	Tyler	topyli	eh not really cuz it doesnt work :( i need 3d
2005-10-18T14:51:00.000Z	topyli	Tyler	just buy a matrox card like linux users have done always =)
