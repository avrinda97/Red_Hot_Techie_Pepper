2009-07-14T13:24:00.000Z	grawity	ojdanke	You can be in multiple channels at once.
2009-07-14T13:19:00.000Z	grawity	ojdanke	IRC is better than all (well, most) chat systems.
2009-07-14T13:22:00.000Z	grawity	ojdanke	This channel (#ubuntu) is mostly the support channel for Ubuntu Linux.
2009-07-14T13:23:00.000Z	grawity	ojdanke	But there are many other channels in this network, and there are many other IRC networks.
2009-07-14T13:23:00.000Z	grawity	ojdanke	First, find out the channel name. Then type /join #channelname
2009-07-14T13:26:00.000Z	grawity	ojdanke	On Freenode, the "generic" chat channel is #defocus. (Usually one would use /list to see all channels in the network - but since this network is so big, that command could easily flood you off IRC for a while, so I really would not recommend using it.)
2009-07-14T13:26:00.000Z	grawity	ojdanke	Try /msg alis help
2009-07-14T13:26:00.000Z	grawity	ojdanke	There are also websites such as http://irc.netsplit.de/ and http://searchirc.com/ that can search all channels in all networks.
