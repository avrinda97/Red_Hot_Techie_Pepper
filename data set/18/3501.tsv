2012-10-06T00:31:00.000Z	sharperguy		Hey. I'm running Kubuntu 12.04 and I have no sound in WINE. What could be the reason for this? I tried the test sound in winecfg and get nothig
2012-10-06T00:32:00.000Z	theadmin	sharperguy	Try running your wine app with "padsp wine /path/to/your/file.exe"
2012-10-06T00:32:00.000Z	theadmin	sharperguy	When padsp is installed.
2012-10-06T00:34:00.000Z	sharperguy	theadmin	that didnt seem to make a difference
2012-10-06T00:34:00.000Z	theadmin	sharperguy	Damn, okay then, not too sure... I'd dig deeper but am tired
2012-10-06T00:40:00.000Z	theadmin	sharperguy	In Kubuntu it's an easy fix :) You can remove Pulseaudio. KDE, luckily, doesn't need the damned thing.
2012-10-06T00:44:00.000Z	theadmin	sharperguy	It does, called "Muon"?
2012-10-06T00:45:00.000Z	theadmin	sharperguy	If you want the one from the GTK versions of Ubuntu, you can sudo apt-get install software-center
2012-10-06T00:45:00.000Z	theadmin	sharperguy	Kubuntu is a GTK-free environment by default so it makes sense why they didn't include that
2012-10-06T00:46:00.000Z	theadmin	sharperguy	Probably not.
2012-10-06T00:47:00.000Z	theadmin	sharperguy	Well... Canonical decided to drop Kubuntu support (it's still community-supported, but all that non-free stuff that is included in Ubuntu won't be in Kubuntu by default)
2012-10-06T00:47:00.000Z	sharperguy	theadmin	oh thats a shame since KDE is way better than GNOME now
2012-10-06T00:47:00.000Z	theadmin	sharperguy	I agree, but you can install all those apps, the software store is called "software-center", the music player that comes by default is Banshee I think
2012-10-06T00:48:00.000Z	sharperguy	theadmin	yeah i know that. I don't really need it that badly it just seems strange they'd leave out all their money making services like the app store, ubuntu one and the music store etc just because i use a different DE
2012-10-06T00:55:00.000Z	theadmin	sharperguy	:P
2012-10-06T01:00:00.000Z	sharperguy	theadmin	since you use KDE, have you ever had a big with the system tray exanding way more than it should and taking over the whole panel so i cant see the task manager or clock?
2012-10-06T01:00:00.000Z	theadmin	sharperguy	Maybe it's hungry? Did you try feeding it? :P Other than that nope, I haven't, weird issue
2012-10-06T01:01:00.000Z	sharperguy	theadmin	hmm ok
