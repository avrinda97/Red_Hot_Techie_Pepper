2009-06-26T10:29:00.000Z	juxbox		I have kernel 2.6.28, do I need to upgrade to 2.6.30?
2009-06-26T10:30:00.000Z	juxbox		but I was told that it has a newer alsa so it can fix my audio problem
2009-06-26T10:30:00.000Z	dtchen	juxbox	yes, it does.
2009-06-26T10:31:00.000Z	dtchen	juxbox	the alternative, of course, is to compile alsa-driver 1.0.20 yourself
2009-06-26T10:31:00.000Z	dtchen	juxbox	either way, you end up with a non-standard install
2009-06-26T10:34:00.000Z	juxbox	dtchen	would that be a better choice http://www.stchman.com/alsa_update.html
2009-06-26T10:34:00.000Z	dtchen	juxbox	no
2009-06-26T10:34:00.000Z	dtchen	juxbox	please don't use that script; you really only need a newer alsa-driver
2009-06-26T10:35:00.000Z	juxbox	dtchen	that script will download and auto compile a newer alsa driver, check the website and tell me.
2009-06-26T10:36:00.000Z	dtchen	juxbox	you can accomplish the same thing by installing the newer kernel i mentioned and then rebooting into it, or installing alsa-driver and then rebooting
2009-06-26T10:37:00.000Z	dtchen	juxbox	if you _absolutely_ don't want to do either of those by hand, then feel free to use the script, but i cannot (and won't) vouch for any side effects
2009-06-26T10:39:00.000Z	juxbox	dtchen	but why didn't ubuntu use that newest kernel by default?
2009-06-26T10:42:00.000Z	dtchen	juxbox	it was released quite some time after jaunty was released.
2009-06-26T10:42:00.000Z	dtchen	juxbox	Ubuntu doesn't handle time travel too well ;-)
2009-06-26T10:45:00.000Z	juxbox	dtchen	I think I will upgrade my kenel, since I have a bleeding edge labtop, so probably I need it, but is [ ]K[^Omegadoom linux-image-2.6.30-020630-generic_2.6.30-020630_i386.deb10-Jun-2009 11:27  24M the one I need? It's intel x86 labtop.
2009-06-26T10:45:00.000Z	dtchen	juxbox	check "uname -m"
2009-06-26T10:49:00.000Z	dtchen	juxbox	then yes, use the i386 deb
2009-06-26T11:10:00.000Z	juxbox	dtchen	I just installed it, but it says Same version is already installed
