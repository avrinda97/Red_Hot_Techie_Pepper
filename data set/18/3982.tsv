2009-06-25T14:22:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	Aacron	We are trying to discontinue the usage of root password.
2009-06-25T14:23:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	Aacron	Why do you think?
2009-06-25T14:24:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	Aacron	Because too many breakage on account of silly users using root power.
2009-06-25T14:28:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	Aacron	Root -- Would I trust giving you the full granted permission to use my lamborghini?  No thank.  You deal with your Civic. :)
2009-06-25T14:29:00.000Z	Aacron	mobi-sheep	 you completely lost me there.  that root talking?  to whom?  why?  do roots talk? :))
2009-06-25T14:39:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	Aacron	You can safely resize the partitions from the LiveCD.  You can't resize the partition you're currently on it.
2009-06-25T14:39:00.000Z	Aacron	mobi-sheep	 ohh I see... cause you cant play with mounted drives, and gparted cant unmount it to resize it
2009-06-25T14:40:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	Aacron	Bingo.
2009-06-25T14:41:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	Aacron	http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/LVM-HOWTO
2009-06-25T14:41:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	Aacron	Yes. With LVM, you can treat 3 HDD as a single gigantic partition.
2009-06-25T14:42:00.000Z	Aacron	mobi-sheep	 that sounds liek raid almost... erm concat(sp-somethign oranother)
2009-06-25T14:43:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	Aacron	With LVM, you can start out with a small size and increase the size as needed.  Flexible.
2009-06-25T14:44:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	Aacron	There also are #lvm channel.
2009-06-25T14:47:00.000Z	Aacron	mobi-sheep	 seems pretty neat.  if (or rather, when) I manage to screw up my linux installation, I think I'll give the LVM thing a shot. can see where it would be extremely handy
2009-06-25T14:48:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	Aacron	Use alternative disk.  There are more choices in it -- Including lvm + encryption.
2009-06-25T14:48:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	Aacron	There are guided partitioning for full disk lvm if you want that.
