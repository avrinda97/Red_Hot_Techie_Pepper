2007-09-20T12:00:00.000Z	theacolyte		2 reasons
2007-09-20T12:01:00.000Z	theacolyte		1) not all my apps work in vmware/xen/etc, and 2) i always find something annoying that makes me leave
2007-09-20T12:01:00.000Z	theacolyte		in my case a proprietary app
2007-09-20T12:02:00.000Z	theacolyte		also, there is nothing as good as outlook + exchange
2007-09-20T12:02:00.000Z	theacolyte		I don't care what you say
2007-09-20T12:02:00.000Z	theacolyte		I run vmware on OSX just to use outlook
2007-09-20T12:02:00.000Z	theacolyte		but anyway, I'm not bashing anything, I'm just having a problem with java :)
