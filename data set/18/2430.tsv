2012-09-16T03:05:00.000Z	davetarmac		Anyone know how to get phpmyadmin working on Ubuntu 12.04?
2012-09-16T03:05:00.000Z	davetarmac		Done apt-get install and that seemed to work, but can't reach it at localhost/phpmyadmin in a browser
2012-09-16T03:05:00.000Z	davetarmac		just receiving a 404 then
2012-09-16T03:06:00.000Z	TJ-	davetarmac	I would imagine you might also need to ensure apache2 has it in its /sites-enabled/ directory
2012-09-16T03:06:00.000Z	davetarmac	TJ-	thanks
2012-09-16T03:07:00.000Z	davetarmac	TJ-	how do I find that? :)
2012-09-16T03:07:00.000Z	TJ-	davetarmac	/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/
2012-09-16T03:08:00.000Z	davetarmac	TJ-	all I have in there is 000-default
2012-09-16T03:08:00.000Z	TJ-	davetarmac	I'm assuming you configured it to work with apache2 during installation?
2012-09-16T03:08:00.000Z	davetarmac	TJ-	I never got the prompt
2012-09-16T03:09:00.000Z	davetarmac	TJ-	Is there a way to remove it fully and start over?
2012-09-16T03:10:00.000Z	TJ-	davetarmac	"sudo dpkg-reconfigure --priority=low phpmyadmin"
2012-09-16T03:11:00.000Z	TJ-	davetarmac	something useful happening?
2012-09-16T03:12:00.000Z	davetarmac	TJ-	seems to be
2012-09-16T03:12:00.000Z	TJ-	davetarmac	good
2012-09-16T03:14:00.000Z	davetarmac	TJ-	gone through all that, set it all up and it's still returning a 404 page :(
2012-09-16T03:15:00.000Z	TJ-	davetarmac	How are you accessing the web-page? from a different PC or the same one that is running apache2?
2012-09-16T03:15:00.000Z	davetarmac	TJ-	same PC
