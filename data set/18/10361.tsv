2006-12-17T17:05:00.000Z	|markie|		are there any xen users around ?
2006-12-17T17:07:00.000Z	|markie|		i am trying to install ubuntu by using Xen. Xen is up and running, only i have no idea how to create a VM
2006-12-17T10:55:00.000Z	|markie|		what is a good ftp daemon
2006-12-17T10:55:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	|markie|	what do you need to do with it?
2006-12-17T10:57:00.000Z	|markie|	Kingsqueak	ftp with certain directiry access and also different root directories
2006-12-17T10:57:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	|markie|	vsftpd is pretty good for basics, for complicated setups proftpd is similar to Apache in the unending flexibility of its configs
2006-12-17T10:58:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	|markie|	proftpd lets you do multiple anonymous accounts and all sorts of odd things
2006-12-17T10:58:00.000Z	|markie|	Kingsqueak	and pure ftpd ?
2006-12-17T10:59:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	|markie|	just 'yet another ftpd'  I'm sure it's fine too, I just know the other two better and prefer proftpd over wu-ftpd for most things just because I like its config files better
2006-12-17T10:59:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	|markie|	take a look here http://vsftpd.beasts.org/
2006-12-17T11:00:00.000Z	|markie|	Kingsqueak	i want to use different root maps and i know vsftpd is not capable of doing that
2006-12-17T11:00:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	|markie|	ah o.k.
2006-12-17T11:00:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	|markie|	I'd recommend proftpd only because I'm familiar with that one, should do that for you
2006-12-17T11:01:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	|markie|	no chance on just using virtual users for the account access eh?
2006-12-17T11:01:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	|markie|	whatever I can do to talk you out of mapping users to local accounts...  I would advise that as much as possible
2006-12-17T11:02:00.000Z	|markie|	Kingsqueak	so vir users means using a db
2006-12-17T11:02:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	|markie|	could just mean a text file as a db, but yeah
2006-12-17T11:02:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	|markie|	keep in mind ftp is clear text so if the password is sent, the account is exposed
