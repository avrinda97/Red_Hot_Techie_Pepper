2008-01-10T00:13:00.000Z	wizzo_		hey all of a sudden there are a couple of websites that i cant get to (shows the page not found thing) happens in firefox and opera but i've been on them before any ideas?
2008-01-10T00:13:00.000Z	Slart	wizzo_	broken dns?
2008-01-10T00:14:00.000Z	Slart	wizzo_	I still say my guess is broken dns
2008-01-10T00:14:00.000Z	Slart	wizzo_	give me the url of one such page
2008-01-10T00:15:00.000Z	Slart	wizzo_	ok.. works from here.. try running this in a terminal "host pepboys.com"
2008-01-10T00:16:00.000Z	wizzo_	Slart	shows up
2008-01-10T00:17:00.000Z	Slart	wizzo_	"pepboys.com has address 168.220.64.64" you get the same ip?
2008-01-10T00:17:00.000Z	wizzo_	Slart	yes
2008-01-10T00:18:00.000Z	Slart	wizzo_	if you write the ip instead of the url, does that work?
2008-01-10T00:18:00.000Z	wizzo_	Slart	nope
2008-01-10T00:20:00.000Z	wizzo_	Slart	i've only found two pages that actually do this to me so far, the other one is netscape.com
2008-01-10T00:22:00.000Z	Slart	wizzo_	it's kind of strange.. can you ping the ip-number of popboys.com? or just "ping pepboys.com" ?
2008-01-10T00:23:00.000Z	wizzo_	Slart	oh i havent tried that... just got 100% packet loss
2008-01-10T00:23:00.000Z	Slart	wizzo_	then something is blocking... you say these sites works sometimes?
2008-01-10T00:24:00.000Z	wizzo_	Slart	no, they dont work at all now, but i go on pepboys all the time, its just the past couple of days i cant get on it
2008-01-10T00:24:00.000Z	Slart	wizzo_	have you installed something lately? firewall software?
2008-01-10T00:28:00.000Z	Slart	wizzo_	. KlrSpz: dns lookup returns the correct ip.. he just can't send any data to it..
2008-01-10T00:33:00.000Z	Slart	wizzo_	you're welcome.. hope you figure it out
