2010-02-27T07:03:00.000Z	message144	GeekSquid	I am trying to see if this will eventually be supported by ubuntu so i can decide whether or not to return it to best buy
2010-02-27T07:04:00.000Z	message144	GeekSquid	it uses the new Intel HD Graphics

2010-02-27T07:07:00.000Z	GeekSquid	message144	sounds like Lucid will eventually support that chipset, we are 2 months out at the moment on a actual release there... so chances are there will be a ppa for that ... lemme look around and see if I can find anything that will make a quick fix for karmic... give me 20-30 min on that though
2010-02-27T07:08:00.000Z	message144	GeekSquid	do you think it would be wise to go with Lucid right now at this point, or is it still unstable? (i need LAMP stack and programming tools, etc)
2010-02-27T07:09:00.000Z	GeekSquid	message144	how much ram?
2010-02-27T07:09:00.000Z	message144	GeekSquid	4G
2010-02-27T07:14:00.000Z	GeekSquid	message144	couple of options... 1. install windows, and run ubuntu in a virtual guest 2.... this might fix your problem https://launchpad.net/~guido-iodice/+archive/experimental-intel/+sourcepub/972269/+listing-archive-extra --- again experimental
2010-02-27T07:14:00.000Z	message144	GeekSquid	do you think there is a good chance that the new Intel HD cards will be supported with the Lucid release?
2010-02-27T07:15:00.000Z	GeekSquid	message144	simple answer = yes
2010-02-27T07:15:00.000Z	message144	GeekSquid	until then ill just deal with low res
2010-02-27T07:26:00.000Z	message144	GeekSquid	do you think Lucid is currently stable enough to use right now for personal use?
2010-02-27T07:28:00.000Z	GeekSquid	message144	No, and I don't think they have fixed the problem yet... I'd wait till April
2010-02-27T07:28:00.000Z	message144	GeekSquid	ok
2010-02-27T07:28:00.000Z	message144	GeekSquid	thanks for your help
