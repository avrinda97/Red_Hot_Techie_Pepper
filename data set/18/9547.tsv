2007-03-23T16:45:00.000Z	Tom_Kun_		is it even possible to get this usb dongle working with the atmel driver? I'm a bit unsure since the ubuntu site says it should detect it automaticly, while it doesn't when I plug it in
2007-03-23T16:46:00.000Z	ant	Tom_Kun_	: maybe you have a bad usb, try plugging it into another
2007-03-23T16:46:00.000Z	Tom_Kun_	ant	tried that already :) no change.
2007-03-23T16:47:00.000Z	ant	Tom_Kun_	: that would've been to easy.
2007-03-23T16:47:00.000Z	Tom_Kun_	ant	true enough :p
2007-03-23T16:47:00.000Z	Tom_Kun_		considering ubuntu recognizes that i've inserted a device. :)
2007-03-23T16:47:00.000Z	ant	Tom_Kun_	: there was a guy in here yesterday with usb probs, he had 16 ports and tried forever with the same one, found out it was just bad.
2007-03-23T16:48:00.000Z	Tom_Kun_	ant	well, I do know that atmel cards really aren't that good in linux generally. I've had to connect wired from this computer every time I've used a linux distro.. It would've been nice to get it working though :p
2007-03-23T16:48:00.000Z	Tom_Kun_		since everything else works so smoothly
2007-03-23T16:49:00.000Z	ant	Tom_Kun_	: the bad part is that other people have had it work so easy.
2007-03-23T16:49:00.000Z	ant	Tom_Kun_	: its not like its known not to work.
2007-03-23T16:50:00.000Z	Tom_Kun_	ant	true.. :) just hoped someone in here might have some idea how to get the atmel driver to load on the specific device. Since it's not doing so automagically
2007-03-23T16:51:00.000Z	ant	Tom_Kun_	: does it show up under 'lsusb'?
2007-03-23T16:51:00.000Z	Tom_Kun_	ant	it shows up under BUs 002, Device 004 on lsusb
2007-03-23T16:52:00.000Z	ant	Tom_Kun_	: i had a problem with my camera once.. come to find out i didn't have the right permissions for it.
2007-03-23T16:53:00.000Z	Tom_Kun_	ant	might be that of course.. you never know what might turn up.. I'll have to try to get some hints on where to start, and take it from there. Since the kernel already has atmel precompiled, at least I hopefully wont have to do a kernel recompile to get it running :)
2007-03-23T16:54:00.000Z	ant	Tom_Kun_	: well to get my camera working i had to find the bus# and the usb # and then type 'chmod go+w /proc/bus/usb/002/008'
2007-03-23T16:56:00.000Z	ant	Tom_Kun_	: or try a chmod 777 and maybe switch permissions later
