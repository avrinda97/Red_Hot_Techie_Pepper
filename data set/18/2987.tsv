2010-02-27T19:17:00.000Z	umang		Anyone know of a CLI tool to convert date/time from one timezone to another? (Not the current time just any input time)
2010-02-27T19:19:00.000Z	coz_	umang	 maybe    convdate
2010-02-27T19:19:00.000Z	coz_	umang	   http://linux.die.net/man/1/convdate
2010-02-27T19:19:00.000Z	umang	coz_	Looking at it.
2010-02-27T19:22:00.000Z	umang	coz_	I don't that's what I'm looking for. Basically, I want to convert a date that I input (with an input timezone) and get it in the output timezone, (There flags will be passed to the command). Essentially for things like Ubuntu Classroom. It says 1700 UTC, I want to know when it is for me. And if someone asks me for a time, I want to be able to convert my local time to theirs.
2010-02-27T19:23:00.000Z	coz_	umang	 mmm  let me check hold on
2010-02-27T19:27:00.000Z	coz_	umang	 mm this is proving a bit tuff... I know you can convert UTC to local time and date
2010-02-27T19:28:00.000Z	coz_	umang	 there is most likely already something for what you want to do I just cant find one ...yet
2010-02-27T19:30:00.000Z	coz_	umang	 mm
2010-02-27T19:34:00.000Z	coz_	umang	 you might want to check with perl commands  for this as well
2010-02-27T19:35:00.000Z	umang	coz_	perl? Got it directly from the CLI thanks to erUSUL. :)
2010-02-27T19:35:00.000Z	coz_	umang	 oh ok ... i need to pay more attention  :)
2010-02-27T19:36:00.000Z	umang	coz_	It's alright. Very hard to follow discussions on chanells like these....
2010-02-27T19:36:00.000Z	coz_	umang	 for sure... I know that you can do some time conversions with perl  though ...let me see if i can find a man page or something
2010-02-27T19:37:00.000Z	umang	coz_	I've not written in perl, so I wouldn't know. But the date libraries in most languages can do this pretty easily...
2010-02-27T19:38:00.000Z	coz_	umang	 ok cool... I will stop searching  :)
2010-02-27T19:38:00.000Z	umang	coz_	:)
2010-02-27T19:38:00.000Z	umang	coz_	Thanks anyway. :)
