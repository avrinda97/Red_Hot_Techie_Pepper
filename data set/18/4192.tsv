2010-04-03T17:48:00.000Z	bcj		Are there still plans to replace Firefox with Epiphany in Ubuntu (at some point)?
2010-04-03T17:48:00.000Z	tobi_	bcj	epiphany is a joke lol
2010-04-03T17:48:00.000Z	tobi_		even ie is better
2010-04-03T17:48:00.000Z	bcj	tobi_	WebKit fans would say Gecko is a joke
2010-04-03T17:49:00.000Z	bcj	tobi_	I know developers who have handled the code for each and WebKit is far better (by their testimony).
2010-04-03T17:50:00.000Z	bcj	tobi_	...and, no, iE is the cause for most of the badly coded pages on the web.
2010-04-03T17:50:00.000Z	bcj	tobi_	There's no way you can say that's a good thng.
2010-04-03T17:50:00.000Z	tobi_	bcj	wan't all that serious :)
2010-04-03T17:51:00.000Z	bcj	tobi_	?
2010-04-03T17:51:00.000Z	bcj	tobi_	You're not making sense.
2010-04-03T17:51:00.000Z	tobi_	bcj	I dispise the simplicity of epiphany, because it lacks common features
2010-04-03T17:51:00.000Z	bcj	tobi_	Which features do you miss the most?
2010-04-03T17:52:00.000Z	tobi_	bcj	just use Opera for a while, and you're gonna see what I mean
2010-04-03T17:52:00.000Z	bcj	tobi_	Which features?
2010-04-03T17:52:00.000Z	tobi_		ad blocking is not there in standard
2010-04-03T17:52:00.000Z	bcj	tobi_	Maybe there's a case to make to the Epiphany guys?
2010-04-03T17:53:00.000Z	tobi_	bcj	a lot of small things I do not remember atm
2010-04-03T17:53:00.000Z	bcj	tobi_	Not important enough to remember, hmm.
