2006-06-12T07:56:00.000Z	Flannel	Arafangion	what's automatic about it?
2006-06-12T07:56:00.000Z	Arafangion	Flannel	The fact that it's always trying to do so.
2006-06-12T07:57:00.000Z	Flannel	Arafangion	only when there are fixes, you're not forced to install them though
2006-06-12T07:57:00.000Z	Flannel	Arafangion	including whatever holes are in it?
2006-06-12T07:58:00.000Z	Flannel	Arafangion	right, but what's wrong with voluntary bugfixes for the kernel?
2006-06-12T07:59:00.000Z	Arafangion	Flannel	The fact that it messes up my custom modules, and never misses an opportunity to seriously mess up lilo?
2006-06-12T08:00:00.000Z	Flannel	Arafangion	voluntary updates mess things up?  Just don't update the kernel, remove your meta package, you won't be asked for updates.
2006-06-12T08:02:00.000Z	Arafangion	Flannel	Perhaps the kernel updates should be scripted more carefully.   An automatic update should _never_ leave the system in an unbootable state.
2006-06-12T08:02:00.000Z	Arafangion	Flannel	As it did on one of my two ubuntu systems, my other grub-based system works fine.
2006-06-12T08:04:00.000Z	Flannel	Arafangion	youre blaming ubuntu for your lack of experience re: lilo and kernels then?  Since, it didn't update them without your consent.
2006-06-12T08:04:00.000Z	Arafangion	Flannel	Not lack of experience.
2006-06-12T08:04:00.000Z	Arafangion	Flannel	Just different expectations.
2006-07-31T16:18:00.000Z	Flannel	Arafangion	DJAdmiral, dyndns sends you emails though!
2006-07-31T16:18:00.000Z	Arafangion	Flannel	Just so happens that every time the email got sent, I was away on a 2 week vacation!
2006-07-31T16:19:00.000Z	Flannel	Arafangion	hah.  I've got mine setup to automatically do it ;)
2006-08-27T14:00:00.000Z	Flannel	Arafangion	this is #ubuntu, not #debian
2006-08-27T14:01:00.000Z	Arafangion	Flannel	Oops, sorry!
2007-09-04T05:41:00.000Z	Flannel	Arafangion	6.06 is supported until June of 2009, but the next LTS will be released a year earlier than that (8.04) which you can upgrade striaght to
