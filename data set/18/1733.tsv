2011-01-15T21:09:00.000Z	tekton		i know about vnc, i have a specific question to make
2011-01-15T21:10:00.000Z	tekton		ok sorry. I go on then
2011-01-15T21:11:00.000Z	tekton		i have managed to connect to my kubuntu desktop that uses krdc from a windows 7 netbook using tightvnc
2011-01-15T21:11:00.000Z	tekton		the opposite is impossible, giving server not found
2011-01-15T21:11:00.000Z	tekton		i have done the same dyndns to that mashine too with a different account
2011-01-15T21:11:00.000Z	Migaaresno	tekton	are the ports forwarded?
2011-01-15T21:12:00.000Z	tekton		yes, i have opened the same ports to both
2011-01-15T21:12:00.000Z	tekton		in fact i have made the same settings to both
2011-01-15T21:12:00.000Z	tekton		could that be a matter of compatibility?
2011-01-15T21:13:00.000Z	tekton		could it be a problem of the tightvnc server?
2011-01-15T21:14:00.000Z	Migaaresno	tekton	No, the host was not found. Hmmm. the next thing i would do is check if the ports on the windows machine are open.
2011-01-15T21:14:00.000Z	Migaaresno	tekton	Can you VNC from your windows machine to your windows machine?
2011-01-15T21:15:00.000Z	tekton		nugaaeresno i haven't tried that. i didnd't even imagine to connect to the computer from the same mashine. does this show anything?
2011-01-15T21:15:00.000Z	tekton		migaaeresno i haven't tried that. i didnd't even imagine to connect to the computer from the same mashine. does this show anything?
2011-01-15T21:16:00.000Z	tekton		migaaeresno: i haven't tried that. i didnd't even imagine to connect to the computer from the same mashine. does this show anything?
2011-01-15T21:16:00.000Z	Migaaresno	tekton	It shows the server is working correctly. But take notice! Some servers disallow connecting from the same machine, see settings.
2011-01-15T21:17:00.000Z	tekton		sorry for repeating many times, i'm all rusty with irc and don't remember the commands yet
2011-01-15T21:18:00.000Z	tekton	Migaaresno	i will try to connect to my kubuntu from here then, cause the windows belongs to a friend. then i will ask him to try also
