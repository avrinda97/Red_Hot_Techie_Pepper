2012-07-19T14:59:00.000Z	ikonia	Papa	what is the problem you want resolving ?
2012-07-19T15:02:00.000Z	ikonia	Papa	what are the errors it's giving you
2012-07-19T15:02:00.000Z	ikonia	Papa	and where (what point in your process) are you getting these errors
2012-07-19T15:06:00.000Z	ikonia	Papa	sadly if we are going to help you, we will need specific/exact data
2012-07-19T15:11:00.000Z	ikonia	Papa	you can install it and it does have xchat installed
2012-07-19T15:12:00.000Z	ikonia	Papa	no
2012-07-19T15:12:00.000Z	ikonia	Papa	it will not
2012-07-19T15:16:00.000Z	ikonia	Papa	run the smart checks you have been told to, any more discussion until that has been done is pointless
2012-07-19T15:18:00.000Z	ikonia	Papa	only if the disk doesn't fail
2012-07-19T15:24:00.000Z	ikonia	Papa	please stop just saying "things"
