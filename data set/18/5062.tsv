2010-11-24T16:01:00.000Z	biopyte		ectospam, i still can login on tty1, do you see a way to go on troubleshooting from there?
2010-11-24T16:01:00.000Z	danboid	biopyte	So startx doresn't work then?
2010-11-24T16:02:00.000Z	danboid	biopyte	and you've tried a 'sudo apt-get dist-upgrade' from tty and that fails right?
2010-11-24T16:02:00.000Z	biopyte	danboid	error "server is already active ..."
2010-11-24T16:03:00.000Z	danboid	biopyte	CTRL+ALT+F7
2010-11-24T16:03:00.000Z	biopyte	danboid	thats what i wish to do. however i have only wireless connection in a cafe and i dont know how to connect to the wlan without using X.
2010-11-24T16:04:00.000Z	biopyte	danboid	if i only could connect to wireless from tty1 and then sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
2010-11-24T16:06:00.000Z	danboid	biopyte	I've been saying for years Ubuntu should ship wicd instead of network-manager as wicd has a ncurses gui to connect with. I can't remember the cli commands off the top of my head- its a pain but can be done
2010-11-24T16:06:00.000Z	biopyte	danboid	stupid situation, actually i need the box running to day. the usb stick is brandnew, bought it 2 hours ago. boy, someone is playing games with me ...
2010-11-24T16:06:00.000Z	biopyte		wicd not installed
2010-11-24T16:08:00.000Z	danboid	biopyte	Theres a CLI guide here https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/WiFiHowTo
2010-11-24T16:08:00.000Z	biopyte	danboid	you cant boot from sdhc card, right?
2010-11-24T16:08:00.000Z	biopyte		thanks
2010-11-24T16:08:00.000Z	danboid	biopyte	You might be able to yes, depends on your BIOS
2010-11-24T16:10:00.000Z	biopyte		i see, i could try to make a start-disk on the sd card using the thinkpad and then try to boot it on the eeepc
2010-11-24T16:11:00.000Z	biopyte		i'm creating the sd startup disk right now
2010-11-24T16:11:00.000Z	biopyte		dont believe the eeepc will boot it
2010-11-24T16:14:00.000Z	biopyte	danboid	eepc doesnt boot from the sd card
