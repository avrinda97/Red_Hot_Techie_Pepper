2007-05-17T13:54:00.000Z	padee		i'm sorry to bother again and again... but is here someone who has experience in setting up an ubuntu internet cafe?
2007-05-17T13:54:00.000Z	m0u5e	padee	lol ubuntu internet cafe? that sounds fun :D
2007-05-17T14:04:00.000Z	m0u5e	padee	i actually have no idea... lol im just throwing out ideas :D
2007-05-17T13:56:00.000Z	padee	m0u5e	it is fun... actually... i only have problems in remote controlling my 'client' computers from a admin station... i managed to shut them down over ssh after the time the customers paid... but it is not a proper solution...
2007-05-17T13:57:00.000Z	m0u5e	padee	maybe create an automated script? lol i have no experience in setting up wide networks with ubuntu yet :X
2007-05-17T14:00:00.000Z	padee	m0u5e	what i would need most are 2 things: indicate at the client computer the remaining time.. this could be a console or whatever. 2. i have to set up somehow a parental control for firefox. i didnt find anyting with google...
2007-05-17T14:02:00.000Z	m0u5e	padee	dunno... maybe configure a firewall gateway with parental filters?
2007-05-17T14:03:00.000Z	m0u5e	padee	i have no idea how to do the countdown though.. i'd imagine you'd have to warn them at like the 10 minute mark, to wrap up and save all data XD
2007-05-17T14:03:00.000Z	padee	m0u5e	yes, this is one possibility... i have to feed the router with IPs of forbidden sites... but there should be a faster way, no?
2007-05-17T14:03:00.000Z	padee	m0u5e	exactly...
2007-05-17T14:03:00.000Z	m0u5e	padee	well.... white listing is safer than blacklisting... :)
2007-05-17T14:04:00.000Z	padee	m0u5e	hm... i see.. there is no workaround for that, i assume?
2007-05-17T14:04:00.000Z	m0u5e	padee	sorry, wish i could help :(
2007-05-17T14:05:00.000Z	padee	m0u5e	no problem...
2007-05-17T14:05:00.000Z	m0u5e	padee	have there been other linux cafes?  you might wanna start searching there :)
2007-05-17T14:05:00.000Z	m0u5e	padee	im sure it exists somewhere... and if it doesn't... well it might just become the next best thing :)
2007-05-17T14:06:00.000Z	padee	m0u5e	i saw some pages they offer software... but i am too stupid to install it... :((
2007-05-17T14:06:00.000Z	m0u5e	padee	XD
