2008-04-07T18:07:00.000Z	dublpaws	conartist	do lspci | grep Audio, and paste what it says
2008-04-07T18:09:00.000Z	dublpaws	conartist	lspci lists details regarding your hardware, then grep picks out any line of the output with "Audio" in it.
2008-04-07T18:11:00.000Z	dublpaws	conartist	what I'm doing is plugging some of the details into google, <82801I ubuntu> to see if anyone else has had this problem.
2008-04-07T18:13:00.000Z	dublpaws	conartist	my suspicion is that your install already supports your audio hardware.
2008-04-07T18:13:00.000Z	dublpaws	conartist	and some other problem is causing the symtoms.
2008-04-07T18:17:00.000Z	dublpaws	conartist	here is someone with the same problem -> http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=744216
2008-04-07T18:22:00.000Z	dublpaws	conartist	uname -a
2008-04-07T18:25:00.000Z	dublpaws	conartist	if you $sudo apt-get install gnome-alsamixer  , there's a gui for alsamixer.
