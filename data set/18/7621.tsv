2012-01-12T06:32:00.000Z	aBound	wireless	Open a terminal and type: lspci | grep Network
2012-01-12T06:32:00.000Z	aBound		Oops, wireless drivers.
2012-01-12T06:32:00.000Z	aBound		Blah! my mistake.
2012-01-12T06:32:00.000Z	wireless		thanks aBound
2012-01-12T06:33:00.000Z	aBound	wireless	My mistake it only finds the Network controller in-use. The drivers I can't say if it'll find.
2012-01-12T06:33:00.000Z	wireless	aBound	that only shows wlan0 not wlan1
2012-01-12T06:33:00.000Z	wireless		o
2012-01-12T06:34:00.000Z	wireless		how do I show the drivers for the wlan1 usb?
2012-01-12T06:34:00.000Z	wireless		it is
2012-01-12T06:34:00.000Z	aBound	wireless	You could just type: lspci
2012-01-12T06:34:00.000Z	aBound		To see what it contains.
2012-01-12T06:34:00.000Z	wireless		I have looked it up but getting only ways to show wlan0
2012-01-12T06:36:00.000Z	wireless		I'm still not seeing it by just lspci by the way
2012-01-12T06:36:00.000Z	aBound	wireless	lshw -C network
