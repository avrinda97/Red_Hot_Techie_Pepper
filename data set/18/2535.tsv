2010-06-30T03:54:00.000Z	ennui		does anyone know of a way to color code files/folders in the file browser like in OSX? These emblems just don't cut it I'm afraid
2010-06-30T03:54:00.000Z	ennui		I'm using Nautilus by the way
2010-06-30T03:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ennui	right click a folder -> properties. Click the folder icon in the top left and change the icon to something else
2010-06-30T03:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ennui	you can download some folder icons and set them as you wish
2010-07-20T10:55:00.000Z	ennui	ActionParsnip	That documentation makes no mention of hfsplus filesystems i'm afraid
2010-07-20T10:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ennui	that's all I know dude, sorry. Maybe someone else can contribute
2010-07-20T10:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ennui	can you do it in gparted / qtparted?
2010-07-20T10:58:00.000Z	ennui	ActionParsnip	I will give that a shot. I would prefer to learn how to do it from the command line. I know linux has limited hfs support but I have these old partitions created from OSX and I have no space to back them up so I can reformat to ext4 T_T
2010-07-20T10:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ennui	why not just format the partition to ext4 with a label then restore the data from backup
2010-07-20T11:00:00.000Z	ennui	ActionParsnip	I have no space to back up my data
2010-07-20T11:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ennui	so what if your drives motor suddenly fails. Where is your data?
2010-07-20T11:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ennui	professional data retrieval is not garunteed and costs thousands. Cheap usb drive costs a few hundred
2010-07-20T11:01:00.000Z	ennui	ActionParsnip	I am a retail slave and a few hundred is a luxury. I plan on getting another 1TB in 2 weeks or so
2010-07-20T11:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ennui	you'll kick yourself if it does. Hope it doesn't. But you will be sorry
2010-07-20T11:03:00.000Z	ennui	ActionParsnip	as I said, I plan on getting more space when I can afford it.
2010-07-20T11:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ennui	good
2010-07-20T11:03:00.000Z	ennui	ActionParsnip	The data is not a life or death matter. just media
2010-07-20T11:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ennui	ask in ##hardware. Internal is cheaper
