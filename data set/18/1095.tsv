2012-08-19T15:09:00.000Z	Person		I can't boot from my drive, I mounted the drive in the Live CD, and my files are here, but I think the OS is messed up. I crashed during an update. How can I fix this?
2012-08-19T15:09:00.000Z	bekks	Person	Whats the error message you get when trying to boot from your drive?
2012-08-19T15:11:00.000Z	bekks	Person	Could you please give a full error message when trying to boot from your drive in a pastebin?
2012-08-19T15:11:00.000Z	Person	bekks	this is my only terminal

2012-08-19T15:13:00.000Z	Person	bekks	would something like target file does not have sbin edit mean someting to you?
2012-08-19T15:15:00.000Z	bekks	Person	That means, that your installation is entirely broken, since there is no /sbin anymore.
2012-08-19T15:16:00.000Z	Person	bekks	is there any way to install over it and save my files and settings?
2012-08-19T15:18:00.000Z	bekks	Person	No. Use a liveCD to backup everything you want to preserve.
2012-08-19T15:19:00.000Z	bekks	Person	No.
2012-08-19T15:26:00.000Z	bekks	Person	Expected.
2012-08-19T15:26:00.000Z	bekks	Person	Did you create a backup of the files you wanted to preserve?
2012-08-19T15:26:00.000Z	bekks	Person	Thats not an answer to my question.
2012-08-19T15:27:00.000Z	bekks	Person	You just said you cant see your files anymore - how can you back them up then?
2012-08-19T15:27:00.000Z	Person	bekks	I can see my files
2012-08-19T15:28:00.000Z	bekks	Person	You cant do an upgrade on a broken installation. Expected behviour.
