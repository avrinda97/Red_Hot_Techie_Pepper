2004-10-16T14:56:00.000Z	mkyc-ubuntu		it makes sense they would have their own channel - when doing development you dont want to deal with the clutter of a support channel all the time
2004-10-16T14:56:00.000Z	mkyc-ubuntu		they probably work in both channels
2004-10-16T14:57:00.000Z	|trey|	mkyc-ubuntu	imo, such things shouldn't even be on IRC... but if it must be, others lacking technical knowhow should at least have input...
2004-10-16T14:59:00.000Z	|trey|	mkyc-ubuntu	because I suck @ code  :/
2004-10-16T14:59:00.000Z	|trey|	mkyc-ubuntu	so because I can't code, I can't make suggestions?
2004-10-16T15:03:00.000Z	|trey|	mkyc-ubuntu	desktop oriented devel channels can be quite interesting... also, they are the truely knowledgable, so you learn a lot...
2004-10-16T15:06:00.000Z	|trey|	mkyc-ubuntu	actually, its a good attitude... if you assume they know too much, it will bite you in the butt more often then not..
2004-10-16T15:06:00.000Z	|trey|	mkyc-ubuntu	2 years of tech support  :)
2004-10-16T15:07:00.000Z	mkyc-ubuntu	|trey|	10 years here.. i am truly insane now
2004-10-16T15:07:00.000Z	|trey|	mkyc-ubuntu	umm, ouch... hah, thats half my life time  :)
2004-10-16T15:07:00.000Z	|trey|	mkyc-ubuntu	haha, I'm sorry  :)
2004-10-16T15:10:00.000Z	|trey|	mkyc-ubuntu	agreed
2004-10-27T06:42:00.000Z	|trey|	mkyc-ubuntu	eh, they have clothes damnit
2004-10-27T06:49:00.000Z	mkyc-ubuntu	|trey|	the problem is that richard is not just some guy
2004-10-27T06:49:00.000Z	|trey|	mkyc-ubuntu	to me he is just some guy  :/
2004-10-27T06:55:00.000Z	|trey|	mkyc-ubuntu	it certainly does. Hence why I said it should just be changed... the image as it is now + clothes.
2004-10-27T06:56:00.000Z	|trey|	mkyc-ubuntu	I agree it should be changed. Ubuntu is about community, and the new image depicts that better then the logo... but the image should be more professional.
2004-10-27T07:02:00.000Z	|trey|	mkyc-ubuntu	I can't wait for the Netscape purchases to be included in Ubuntu/Fedora  8)
