2012-10-05T15:21:00.000Z	elgumso		hello - looking for some help with resizing a Linux partition without bringing down the OS. Can anyone point me in the right direction please
2012-10-05T15:22:00.000Z	ztane	elgumso	depends on many things
2012-10-05T15:22:00.000Z	ztane	elgumso	but it depends on how you parititioned your disk
2012-10-05T15:22:00.000Z	ztane	elgumso	inside the box, do you use lvm or not?
2012-10-05T15:23:00.000Z	ztane	elgumso	if your partition is in the middle, you are mostly out of luck
2012-10-05T15:23:00.000Z	ztane	elgumso	no luck then :D
2012-10-05T15:23:00.000Z	ztane	elgumso	should always put lvm inside
2012-10-05T15:24:00.000Z	ztane	elgumso	if you had it as the last partition, you could expand it with fdisk; with lvm you could add separate disks instead of growing an existing one, too
2012-10-05T15:25:00.000Z	ztane	elgumso	you can actually do it afterwards too, but a bit tinkering
2012-10-05T15:25:00.000Z	ztane	elgumso	"a bit"
2012-10-05T15:26:00.000Z	ztane	elgumso	also I suggest for these questions you could go to ubuntu-server ;)
2012-10-05T15:26:00.000Z	ztane	elgumso	hmm acutally if you did not use any swap
2012-10-05T15:27:00.000Z	ztane	elgumso	... if you didnt use any swap, or the extended, you could turn off swap and increase the partition 1,
2012-10-05T15:28:00.000Z	ztane	elgumso	then add another disk for swap
2012-10-05T15:29:00.000Z	elgumso	ztane	thanks bud. sorted!
2012-10-05T15:32:00.000Z	ztane	elgumso	and consider using lvm on any new installations ;)
2012-10-05T15:33:00.000Z	elgumso	ztane	Hehe I think especially in my VM's it's proabably a good idea
2012-10-05T15:33:00.000Z	ztane	elgumso	well lvm is even better on physical harddisks, can move from one disk to another on the fly effortlessly!
