2011-09-22T20:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	me-1	afaik, not by default
2011-09-22T20:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	me-1	you can install them with ubuntu-restricted-extras
2011-09-22T20:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	me-1	also install w32codecs (or w64codecs) from the medibuntu repos and you'll be able to play most stuff
2011-09-22T20:44:00.000Z	me-1	ActionParsnip	 but its not legal in my part of the world
2011-11-21T12:59:00.000Z	me-1	ActionParsnip	 yes . I can install apps by synpetic and apt-get but not software center
2011-11-21T13:08:00.000Z	me-1	ActionParsnip	 thank you

2012-01-06T08:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	me-1	remember to MD5 if you don't use torrents
2012-01-06T08:40:00.000Z	me-1	ActionParsnip	 thank you . i will MD5 . torrent is slowso i use direct install
2012-01-06T08:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	me-1	really, single source is faster than multi-source. Highly dougbtful unless your ISP throttle torrents
2012-01-06T08:41:00.000Z	me-1	ActionParsnip	 ok i am going for torrent per your advice
2012-01-06T08:45:00.000Z	me-1	ActionParsnip	 there is alternate CD and desktop Cd which one I need . I need to install kubuntu on hard disk
2012-01-06T08:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	me-1	the alternate installs in text mode
2012-01-06T08:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	me-1	they both give a desktop OS, I suggest you gran the desktop CD
2012-01-06T08:45:00.000Z	me-1	ActionParsnip	 is desktop CD install-able..?
2012-01-06T08:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	me-1	yes, it installs a desktop OS in a graphical UI
2012-01-14T22:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	me-1	chromium is the open source browser, every now and then google take a snapshot, add some proprietary stuff and call it chrome
