2010-04-16T16:00:00.000Z	Gateway`		hello everybody
2010-04-16T16:00:00.000Z	Gateway`		I have a problem concerning a disk SCSI, I can't mount because the system doesn't detect it :s
2010-04-16T16:01:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	Gateway`	and the device is not showing even under fdisk -l ?
2010-04-16T16:01:00.000Z	Gateway`	psycho_oreos	no :s
2010-04-16T16:02:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	Gateway`	pastebin (not paste) your lspci -nnk output
2010-04-16T16:03:00.000Z	Gateway`	psycho_oreos	I'm not connected to internet via that machine
2010-04-16T16:04:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	Gateway`	that is not the issue here, if you noticed I wrote lspci -nnk not lspci
2010-04-16T16:05:00.000Z	Gateway`	psycho_oreos	I did a " lspci -nnk "
2010-04-16T16:05:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	Gateway`	and I said pastebin not see
2010-04-16T16:06:00.000Z	Gateway`	psycho_oreos	ok wait I'm going to install xchat on that machine, and I'll be back ok ?
2010-04-16T16:24:00.000Z	Gateway`	psycho_oreos	here I am
2010-04-16T16:25:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	Gateway`	so pastebin (not paste) your lspci -nnk output, I want to see if there's a driver loaded for that SCSI card
2010-04-16T16:25:00.000Z	Gateway`	psycho_oreos	http://paste.ubuntu.com/415485/
2010-04-16T16:26:00.000Z	Gateway`	psycho_oreos	yes there is one
2010-04-16T16:26:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	Gateway`	seems like there is
2010-04-16T16:28:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	Gateway`	and despite that you still can't see any hard disks/optical devices through it? maybe dmesg might have some useful info
2010-04-16T16:31:00.000Z	Gateway`	psycho_oreos	would like me to paste bin what dmesg returns ?
2010-04-16T16:31:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	Gateway`	yes
