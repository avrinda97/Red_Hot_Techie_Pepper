2006-11-06T12:23:00.000Z	john64		no problem
2006-11-06T12:24:00.000Z	john64		openoffice.org is availible for windows
2006-11-06T12:25:00.000Z	john64		then its a good idea!
2006-11-06T12:25:00.000Z	john64		linux can be a very productive environment
2006-11-06T12:26:00.000Z	john64		its the only thing i use for school work
2006-11-06T12:27:00.000Z	john64		then its a good idea
2006-11-06T12:28:00.000Z	john64		linux isnt free of spyware because its more secure, its just that no one makes spyware for it
2006-11-06T12:28:00.000Z	john64		generally people who run linux are able to pick out spyware
2006-11-06T12:28:00.000Z	mitrovarr	john64	 I'd say it's a little from column A and a little from column B
2006-11-06T12:28:00.000Z	mitrovarr	john64	 It is more secure, and the userbase is far more alert
2006-11-06T12:29:00.000Z	mitrovarr	john64	 One of the biggest assets for linux spyware security is that linux users use almost entirely open source software, which can't contain spyware almost by definition
2006-11-06T12:29:00.000Z	john64	mitrovarr	don't confuse open with good, richard stallman himself says that the GPL is supposed to encourage free software primarily, whether or not its good doesnt bother him
2006-11-06T12:32:00.000Z	mitrovarr	john64	 I think the problem with the windows culture is the freeware.  It's free, but not open source, and so much of it is malware funded.
2006-11-06T12:36:00.000Z	mitrovarr	john64	 Open source is intrinsically more trustworthy, though, because anyone can check it out and find malware.  That just means you need a trustworthy source for binaries, which is easy to find.
2006-11-06T12:40:00.000Z	mitrovarr	john64	 bugs and exploits operate under the same principle, to a degree; overt ones are caught by people picking through the code.
2006-11-06T12:42:00.000Z	mitrovarr	john64	 yes, but canonical is trustworthy; they wouldn't destroy their business by including malware.  The problem with freeware is that you have to trust tons and tons of minor entities, and eventually you get one that is corrupt.
2006-11-06T12:51:00.000Z	mitrovarr	john64	 the problem isn't trusting ms
2006-11-06T12:49:00.000Z	mitrovarr	john64	 If you were that nervous, you could always compile programs yourself
