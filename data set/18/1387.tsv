2011-07-05T00:09:00.000Z	japro		guess Ill have to play minecraft wil running pi or something :D
2011-07-05T00:10:00.000Z	japro		i'm trying to find a program that can max 2 cores quickly
2011-07-05T00:10:00.000Z	japro		pi apparently only uses one thread
2011-07-05T00:11:00.000Z	DasEi	japro	cpuburn (carefull) use as many instances as you've got cores
2012-06-01T00:28:00.000Z	DasEi	japro	on the ubuntu mirrors
2012-06-01T00:36:00.000Z	DasEi	japro	use a torrent, it auto re-checks
2012-06-01T00:47:00.000Z	japro	DasEi	not in C/C++
2012-06-01T00:49:00.000Z	DasEi	japro	you can save a disc by using usb install
2012-06-01T00:49:00.000Z	japro	DasEi	i happen to have a stack of cds lying around that i'm never using anyway... :D
2012-06-01T01:13:00.000Z	DasEi	japro	how much ram ?
2012-06-01T01:14:00.000Z	DasEi	japro	well, tmp in tmpfs as var and some other minors, the system on the ssd and /home and other storage on the hdd
2012-06-01T01:15:00.000Z	japro	DasEi	what does "as var" mean? what do i have to google for?
2012-06-01T01:15:00.000Z	DasEi	japro	a dir, /var
2012-06-01T01:16:00.000Z	DasEi	japro	there are some very small system dirs with temporary contents that freak out nands easily, quite small so can have them in a ramdisk rather
2012-06-01T01:17:00.000Z	DasEi	japro	swap on 16 gb ram ? overkill
2012-06-01T01:19:00.000Z	japro	DasEi	oh, so i can just not have a swap partition? i wasn't aware that is an option :)
2012-06-01T01:22:00.000Z	DasEi	japro	the only reason there is hibernation, true
