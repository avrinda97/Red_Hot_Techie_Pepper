2009-05-01T14:51:00.000Z	PerryArmstrong		gordonjcp; ship it takes 4-6 weeks to be delivered
2009-05-01T14:52:00.000Z	PerryArmstrong		gordonjcp; any idea how i can do my install from the downloaded iso file without writing it to cd...ny possibility??
2009-05-01T14:52:00.000Z	PerryArmstrong		gordonjcp; not using VM..
2009-05-01T14:53:00.000Z	PerryArmstrong		h2g2bob; any other possibility???
2009-05-01T14:53:00.000Z	snek_	PerryArmstrong	do you have a USB stick which fits the ISO?
2009-05-01T14:53:00.000Z	PerryArmstrong		snek_; no i dont
2009-05-01T14:53:00.000Z	PerryArmstrong		snek_; i wanted to directly do an install from the ISO on my desktop
2009-05-01T14:53:00.000Z	PerryArmstrong		wtv; if its safe doing
2009-05-01T14:54:00.000Z	snek_	PerryArmstrong	ok that makes things more difficult, however it IS possible to put the iso on a harddrive and install from that.. but it's too complicated for me to explain here
2009-05-01T14:54:00.000Z	PerryArmstrong		wtv; and if its a proven and guaranteed method
2009-05-01T14:54:00.000Z	PerryArmstrong	snek_	wtv; I am only trying to learn doing things in new ways
2009-05-01T14:55:00.000Z	snek_	PerryArmstrong	good for you :) that is the best way to learn :)
2009-05-01T14:55:00.000Z	PerryArmstrong		snek_; thanks...
2009-05-01T14:55:00.000Z	snek_	PerryArmstrong	I managed to get Xubuntu onto a laptop with no cd-rom and no option to boot from usb.. it was a hell of a job but i managed eventually :)
