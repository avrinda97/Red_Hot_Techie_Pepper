2005-09-25T13:29:00.000Z	Morimando		I only use Ubuntu on my laptop at the moment, and not sure if i continue using it, if i don't get the friggin Fn key to work
2005-09-25T13:30:00.000Z	tritium	Morimando	have you tried setting up keyboard shortcuts?
2005-09-25T13:31:00.000Z	Morimando	tritium	I have setup the Multimediakeys and the volume keys, those where easy because they created an ordinary event, i used "dmesg" to see what event and then assigned the key a keycode. But Fn and Fn+something doesn't create any event visible in dmesg
2005-09-25T13:32:00.000Z	tritium	Morimando	I see.
