2007-04-25T14:35:00.000Z	breery	LjL	iv read that post before and to b honest i dont really understand it al all. im currently using a Live Cd while writing this.
2007-04-25T14:36:00.000Z	LjL	breery	i'm afraid i can't understand much of it either. at least you know it's a known problem and being investigated, if nothing else
2007-04-25T14:37:00.000Z	breery	LjL	I dont mind reformatting but there are some things i really need to get off the drive first, do you kno how i can access it from a live cd or is it possible?
2007-04-25T14:38:00.000Z	LjL	breery	of course it's possible to access it from the live cd... just mount it. "sudo mount /dev/hda1 /media/something", after creating /media/something while in the live cd, and assuming hda1 is your hd partition
2007-04-25T14:38:00.000Z	breery	LjL	i think is sdb1 because its the slave, ill try now thx
2007-04-25T14:40:00.000Z	breery	LjL	its now saying " wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sdb1,
2007-04-25T14:41:00.000Z	LjL	breery	please paste on one line, or use the pastebin. are you sure sdb1 actually is the partition you're looking for? do you have other OS's on that drive? you said it's the slave, but primary slave or secondary slave?
2007-04-25T14:42:00.000Z	breery	LjL	im almost certain that that is the drive, windows is on the master drive by itself and linux is on the slave, i have no other drives or partitions
2007-04-25T14:43:00.000Z	LjL	breery	then it's extremely weird that it wouldn't mount it. if it definitely is the right partition, then it sounds like it's corrupted. try installing "volumeid" and asking it what filesystem type it is
2007-04-25T14:44:00.000Z	breery	LjL	is volumeid a command in the terminal or does it have to be installed with Synaptic?
2007-04-25T14:45:00.000Z	LjL	breery	"volumeid" is a package, which means that you can either install it with Synaptic or just type "sudo apt-get install volumeid" in a terminal. then the command is called "vol_id", try typing it
2007-04-25T15:11:00.000Z	breery	LjL	i just managed to mount it, just for refrence i ran e2fsck /dev/sdb1 and it came up wit a heap of errors things were in the wrong group and directories so i said yes to fix and i was able to mount the drive, thanks for your help
2007-04-25T15:11:00.000Z	LjL	breery	well, that means there's something awkward, though. i'd try checking that your HD is physically good - try the "smartmontools" package (then "smartctl -A /dev/sdb" should list all parameters for the drive)
2007-04-25T15:17:00.000Z	breery	LjL	it comes up permission denied, if i sudo smartctl -A /dev/sdb1 it just tells me the program version and homepage
2007-04-25T15:29:00.000Z	breery	LjL	crisis averted, thanks :-D
