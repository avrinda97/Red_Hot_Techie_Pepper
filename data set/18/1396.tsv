2011-10-26T19:56:00.000Z	hid		Hi, i've got some question concerning the installation of kubuntu 11.10. How many partition should I create and what size ? How to configure the bootloader? And is it possible to keep windows selection when I wanna "delete" linux ?
2011-10-26T19:57:00.000Z	bobweaver	hid	 it is up to you to make partitions if you want to make one that is for home folder ecty
2011-10-26T19:58:00.000Z	bobweaver	hid	 most people just make too one for system one for swap
2011-10-26T19:58:00.000Z	bobweaver	hid	 if you are just testing kubuntu I say to go with 20 gigs you can use tools to resize latter
2011-10-26T19:58:00.000Z	hid	bobweaver	what do you think of: 10Gib for / , and 3 Gib swap (4Gib of ram)
2011-10-26T19:59:00.000Z	bobweaver	hid	 that will also work
2011-10-26T19:59:00.000Z	hid	bobweaver	I thought 10Gib wasn't enough. Ohh 4Gib of swap ok
2011-10-26T20:00:00.000Z	bobweaver	hid	ten will be I thinkthat kubuntu needs like 4 at bare min
2011-10-26T20:00:00.000Z	bobweaver	hid	but 20 would be nice
2011-10-26T20:01:00.000Z	bobweaver	hid	 if you have 4gigs of ram why not test in virtual box ?
2011-10-26T20:03:00.000Z	hid	bobweaver	I tried once but I had pb with ethernet card and the os was very  slow.
2011-10-26T20:03:00.000Z	bobweaver	hid	 did you play with the network settings ?
2011-10-26T20:07:00.000Z	hid	bobweaver	nope, nothing. I tried with the ethernet cable andthe wifi but still nothing.
2011-10-26T20:08:00.000Z	bobweaver	hid	 that is a bridged connections ?
2011-10-26T20:08:00.000Z	hid	bobweaver	It was the 10.04 version. Now when I try kubuntu 11.10 on a liveusb, it's very fast and beautyful.
2011-10-26T20:10:00.000Z	hid	bobweaver	a bridged connexion? What do you mean ? My pc was linked on the internet box.
2011-10-26T20:10:00.000Z	bobweaver	hid	 under settings >>network  in virtual box
2011-10-26T20:11:00.000Z	hid	bobweaver	I don't think so. It was the 1st time I had a pb with virtualbox.
