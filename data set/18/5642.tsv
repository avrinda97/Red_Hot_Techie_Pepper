2008-09-15T01:13:00.000Z	cgentry72	Kxx	when i install cairo dock it installs avant window manager
2008-09-15T01:14:00.000Z	cgentry72	Kxx	are they the same thing
2008-09-15T01:14:00.000Z	Kxx	cgentry72	look for cairo-dock in synaptic ?
2008-09-15T01:14:00.000Z	Kxx	cgentry72	nope, they are not
2008-09-15T01:15:00.000Z	cgentry72	Kxx	it says its installed but when i do a run cairo dock nothing happens
2008-09-15T01:16:00.000Z	Kxx	cgentry72	It might be hiding behing your bottom panel ?
2008-09-15T01:16:00.000Z	cgentry72	Kxx	sorrry but i deleted my bottom panel so its not there
2008-09-15T01:16:00.000Z	Kxx	cgentry72	Try moving your bottom panel to side for a moment and see if you notice sthing down ?
2008-09-15T01:17:00.000Z	cgentry72	Kxx	i dont have a bottom panel
2008-09-15T01:17:00.000Z	cgentry72	Kxx	i have the program running but i don't have any applets
2008-09-15T01:17:00.000Z	Kxx	cgentry72	try running it from a terminal and see if it crashes eventually ?
2008-09-15T01:19:00.000Z	cgentry72	Kxx	shouldnt it come with applets
2008-09-15T01:20:00.000Z	Kxx	cgentry72	I have not got it installed right now, but Its a separate package for sure ..
2008-09-15T01:20:00.000Z	cgentry72	Kxx	the applets are seperate?
2008-09-15T01:21:00.000Z	Kxx	cgentry72	cairo dock definetely unrelated to applets
