2006-12-26T14:59:00.000Z	erpo		Could someone please do a sudo opcontrol --no-vmlinux --start and tell me what it says on Edgy? I think opcontrol is broken
2006-12-26T14:59:00.000Z	erpo		sudo apt-get install oprofile
2006-12-26T15:01:00.000Z	missing_	erpo	it gives me no outpout
2006-12-26T15:02:00.000Z	erpo	missing_	sudo opcontrol --no-vmlinux --start
2006-12-26T15:02:00.000Z	missing_	erpo	its not harmfull is it?
2006-12-26T15:03:00.000Z	erpo	missing_	No, not harmful. And thanks, but mind the pasting.
2006-12-26T15:04:00.000Z	erpo	missing_	You'll want to run sudo opcontrol --shutdown before much longer.
2006-12-26T15:04:00.000Z	erpo	missing_	It's not harmful but it does create system overhead while it's running.
2006-12-26T15:05:00.000Z	missing_	erpo	ohh i dont think it will mess with me compiling a kernel will it?
2006-12-26T15:06:00.000Z	erpo	missing_	It will not cause errors, but it will slow the compiling down about 1%-8%
2006-12-26T15:06:00.000Z	erpo	missing_	There's no reason to leave it running if you're not using it. It's for collecting performance data.
2006-12-26T15:07:00.000Z	erpo	missing_	Thanks for the help. I guess it's just F'd on my laptop and my desktop in exactly the same way, but not yours.
2006-12-26T15:07:00.000Z	erpo	missing_	You're running edgy, right?
2006-12-26T15:08:00.000Z	missing_	erpo	well i just killed it
2006-12-26T15:08:00.000Z	erpo	missing_	Huh. That's so weird. Because opcontrol is a shell script, and when I start it, I get an error from the interpreter.
2006-12-26T15:25:00.000Z	erpo	missing_	I never mess with kernel patching. I just download the full source tarball each time.
2006-12-26T15:31:00.000Z	erpo	missing_	I have never tried compiling an FBSD kernel, but I admire their philosophy.
2006-12-26T15:33:00.000Z	missing_	erpo	to tell u the truth even thoug u have to configure everything by hand its a whole lot easier cause they have that darn handbook
