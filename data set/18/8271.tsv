2007-09-16T06:45:00.000Z	Bossmanbeta	fermatstheorem	i wasn't trying to be document-precise.. I was trying to convey a concept, but thanks for your input! :)
2007-09-16T06:45:00.000Z	fermatstheorem	Bossmanbeta	it never hurts to be pedantic :-P
2007-09-16T06:49:00.000Z	fermatstheorem	Bossmanbeta	let us not forget /boot, separate /boot partition has proven to save lives
2007-09-16T06:50:00.000Z	Bossmanbeta	fermatstheorem	he will make a / partition which will cover /boot
2007-09-16T06:50:00.000Z	fermatstheorem	Bossmanbeta	i agree. when we fsck up the system, separate /boot atleast helps us to boot into the other OS
2007-09-16T06:51:00.000Z	Bossmanbeta	fermatstheorem	 ?? putting /boot in / does nothing to affect dual-boot ability, sir.
2007-09-16T06:52:00.000Z	fermatstheorem	Bossmanbeta	i agree about dual boot, but when new users hose the / partition...
2007-09-16T06:54:00.000Z	Bossmanbeta	fermatstheorem	opinions abound I'm just giving mine.
2007-09-16T06:54:00.000Z	fermatstheorem	Bossmanbeta	i guess we are kinda quite enthusiastic about welcoming new linux users :)
2007-09-16T06:54:00.000Z	Bossmanbeta	fermatstheorem	I'd say you were, I'm just chatting with a fellow who's asking for help
2007-09-16T06:55:00.000Z	fermatstheorem	Bossmanbeta	no hard feelings! just plain old harmless (0ver) enthusiasm on my part :).
2007-09-16T06:56:00.000Z	Bossmanbeta	fermatstheorem	it's ok -- speech is free, reveling in it keeps it alive... enjoy
2007-09-16T06:58:00.000Z	fermatstheorem	Bossmanbeta	vancomycin: two is company, i suggest you talk to Bossmanbeta, he sure knows what he is talking
2007-09-16T07:01:00.000Z	fermatstheorem	Bossmanbeta	one can make /boot noauto...
2007-09-16T07:01:00.000Z	Bossmanbeta	fermatstheorem	yeppers... however simplicity has its benefits... <shrug>
2007-09-16T07:02:00.000Z	fermatstheorem	Bossmanbeta	i mean... i've been scarred enough by noobish stuff..didn't want others to go through the hell that i went through
2007-09-16T07:02:00.000Z	Bossmanbeta	fermatstheorem	of course, when the next question is "how do I make windows my auto-boot option instead of ubuntu?" You can type it all out :)
