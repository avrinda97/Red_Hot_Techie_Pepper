2010-05-14T22:45:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	perlsyntax	no. you'll be using the gcc you currently have installed to compile the new version
2010-05-14T22:46:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	perlsyntax	what gcc version is this that you want?
2010-05-14T22:47:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	perlsyntax	you can use the 'checkinstall' program to make a .deb package of something you compile on your system
2010-05-14T22:48:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	perlsyntax	pleace use my nick if you're talking to me
2010-05-14T22:48:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	perlsyntax	that isn't the bot message i wanted.. sorry
2010-05-14T22:53:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	perlsyntax	don't see what? checkinstall? it's a command line utility
2010-05-14T22:53:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	perlsyntax	try in 'whereis checkinstall' on the command line
2010-05-14T22:56:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	perlsyntax	you'll probably want to read at least some of the following --> zless /usr/share/doc/checkinstall/README.gz
