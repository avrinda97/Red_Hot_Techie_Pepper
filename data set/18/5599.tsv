2008-10-18T22:41:00.000Z	naxa		how can i enable that desktop cube? enabling in ccsm and pressing ctrl-alt-down doesn't do anything! why is that? I want that eye candy cube.
2008-10-18T22:42:00.000Z	csilk	naxa	 you need a bigger virtual desktop size
2008-10-18T22:43:00.000Z	naxa	csilk	how can i do that?
2008-10-18T22:43:00.000Z	csilk	naxa	 ccsm general config w/e that menu is called
2008-10-18T22:44:00.000Z	csilk	naxa	 i cant remember what menu it's in, you can always google it, i dont use compiz anymore due to the fact it breaks java
2008-10-18T22:50:00.000Z	naxa	csilk	sorry i just froze... where can i set it up to 4?
2008-10-18T22:50:00.000Z	csilk	naxa	 i cant remember what menu it's in, you can always google it, i dont use compiz anymore due to the fact it breaks java
2008-10-18T22:51:00.000Z	naxa	csilk	ok, thanks!
2008-10-18T22:52:00.000Z	naxa	csilk	anyway, do you think that it is possible that my ubuntu 804 freeze SOMETIMES (not allways, but regularly after 10-20 minutes) 1) if compiz is enabled 2) if it is NOT enabled 3) does NOT freeze in gdm ?
2008-10-18T22:53:00.000Z	csilk	naxa	 its under the "general options" menu
2008-10-18T22:53:00.000Z	naxa	csilk	thanks for that!
2008-10-18T23:15:00.000Z	csilk	naxa	terminal >  less /etc/X11/xorg.conf   pastebin the output and I'll tell you
2008-10-18T23:17:00.000Z	csilk	naxa	 you done that?
2008-10-18T23:17:00.000Z	naxa	csilk	http://paste.ubuntu.com/59367/
2008-10-18T23:18:00.000Z	naxa	csilk	also i feel that compiz somehow makes my ubuntu freeze in 10-20 minutes, but before that it didn't do this - i was able to use compiz in older ubuntu versions
2008-10-18T23:18:00.000Z	csilk	naxa	 you are using the INTEL i810 video driver
2008-10-18T23:18:00.000Z	naxa	csilk	thank you!
