2009-07-03T00:17:00.000Z	Donedeez		can anyone help me with rc.d?
2009-07-03T00:18:00.000Z	te_	Donedeez	No, you only need rc1.d rc2.d rc3.d
2009-07-03T00:18:00.000Z	te_		etc
2009-07-03T00:18:00.000Z	te_	Donedeez	What do you need?
2009-07-03T00:18:00.000Z	te_	Donedeez	What are you trying to do?
2009-07-03T00:18:00.000Z	Donedeez		socket files
2009-07-03T00:18:00.000Z	Donedeez		and a script relies on rc.d
2009-07-03T00:18:00.000Z	Donedeez		i was wondering if i coudl just edit the script to one of hte numbers
2009-07-03T00:19:00.000Z	te_	Donedeez	Yes you can edit them...
2009-07-03T00:19:00.000Z	te_	Donedeez	What do you need to do?
2009-07-03T00:19:00.000Z	Donedeez		k. does it matter which number i use?
2009-07-03T00:19:00.000Z	Donedeez		i am trying to set up a socket policy file
2009-07-03T00:19:00.000Z	te_	Donedeez	It only orders them, (order in which they are run)
2009-07-03T00:20:00.000Z	Donedeez		k so it doesnt really matter which number i use then i guess.. yea?
2009-07-03T00:22:00.000Z	te_	Donedeez	If you'll notice, rc2.d and rc3.d are same, so if you put what you want in rc2.d, that's prbably all you need to do.
