2005-03-15T17:23:00.000Z	drspin		what is the best way to share files between two computers that are far away?
2005-03-15T17:24:00.000Z	drspin		hmm - I was thinking something closer to NFS or SMB -- but I'm not sure how it would be possible to make these work from 2 different networks
2005-03-15T17:25:00.000Z	ermo	drspin	afaik, both NFS and SMB were developed to provide LAN services.
2005-03-15T17:26:00.000Z	ermo	drspin	do you _have_ to share files real-time or do they just need to be 'synchronized'?
2005-03-15T17:26:00.000Z	drspin	ermo	right ;) well I want to store all my music and movies on my dual processor machine
2005-03-15T17:27:00.000Z	ermo	drspin	what distance are we talking? meters? hops? parsecs?
2005-03-15T17:29:00.000Z	drspin	ermo	LOL -- about 5 feet from me -- but I want my parents to be able to use it as well (900 miles)
2005-03-15T17:30:00.000Z	ermo	drspin	so, you have a LAN and two computers, of which one is a dual-proc server and the other is a workstation.
2005-03-15T17:30:00.000Z	drspin	ermo	-- sort of... but the computers each lease their own IP address from my ISP
2005-03-15T17:31:00.000Z	ermo	drspin	but why don't you connect them via 2 seperate NICs? and either a switch or a x-over cable?
2005-03-15T17:32:00.000Z	ermo	drspin	doesn't _have_ to cost you a fortune, you know.
2005-03-15T17:32:00.000Z	drspin	ermo	I plan to play with VPN here soon - which is why it's setup this way -- but for now...
2005-03-15T17:33:00.000Z	ermo	drspin	but you'd get a rather large latency. And you'd be limited to <= <min isp bandwidth>/2
2005-03-15T17:34:00.000Z	ermo	drspin	or, ... eh ... without the /2
2005-03-15T17:34:00.000Z	drspin	ermo	bandwidth is not a problem... the latency will be annoying but I will deal with it -- it'll help motivate me to learn vpn
2005-03-15T17:35:00.000Z	ermo	drspin	well, if you *want* to use vpn, you'll create a share medium (logically) anyway, at which point smb or nfs *should* work anyway.
2005-03-15T17:37:00.000Z	ermo	drspin	... without using vpn (or some other form of) tunneling?
2005-03-15T17:39:00.000Z	ermo	drspin	root:<foobar> I'd think
