2011-01-29T02:23:00.000Z	BootFailure		I'm not spamming.
2011-01-29T02:23:00.000Z	BootFailure		Those nicks were taken.
2011-01-29T02:24:00.000Z	BootFailure		My laptop overheated, now Ubuntu won't boot.
2011-01-29T02:24:00.000Z	BootFailure		it drops to a ash shell
2011-01-29T02:25:00.000Z	BootFailure		!language | burgdorfer
2011-01-29T02:26:00.000Z	murchadh	BootFailure	type startx at the ash prompt and report back.
2011-01-29T02:26:00.000Z	BootFailure		I did, it didn't work murchadh.
2011-01-29T02:28:00.000Z	murchadh	BootFailure	Not really a report that, buddy!
2011-01-29T02:30:00.000Z	BootFailure	murchadh	Well, the command doesn't work in initramfs, not sure what else you want me to report?
2011-01-29T02:32:00.000Z	murchadh	BootFailure	I never mentioned initramfs.
2011-01-29T02:32:00.000Z	BootFailure	murchadh	That was my fault, it boots in initramfs and gives me a ash shell.
2011-01-29T02:33:00.000Z	BootFailure		I think it may be a problem with my swap partition?
2011-01-29T02:33:00.000Z	BootFailure		I've read something about that.
2011-01-29T02:33:00.000Z	murchadh	BootFailure	But what is the output of startx at an ash prompt?
2011-01-29T02:34:00.000Z	BootFailure	murchadh	well, it doesn't find it, I think it's something like "/bin/sh startx not found"
2011-01-29T02:34:00.000Z	murchadh	BootFailure	See if there is a script called /usr/bin/startx
2011-01-29T02:35:00.000Z	BootFailure	murchadh	OK, I will do that. Thank you.
2011-01-29T02:37:00.000Z	murchadh	BootFailure	At your prompt type /usr/bin/startx and it could give you an error on output which may help identify the problem.
