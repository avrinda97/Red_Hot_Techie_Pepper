2008-01-28T22:45:00.000Z	usr13	shift1	Yes you can implement passwordless login.
2008-01-28T22:46:00.000Z	usr13	shift1	System -> Administration -> Login Window
2008-01-28T22:47:00.000Z	usr13	shift1	Not a good idea to remove password.  Passwords afford security on a linux system, not having one is very bad.
2008-01-28T22:48:00.000Z	usr13	shift1	If you go to:  System -> Administration -> Login Window  you can implement passwordless login.
2008-01-28T22:51:00.000Z	usr13	shift1	We know that it doesn't make much difference on MS Windows, but Linux is different, passwords are very important.
2008-01-28T22:52:00.000Z	usr13	shift1	Linux is more secure and stable than MS Windows when good passwords are used, but it is quite the opposite if passwords are not used.
2008-01-28T22:53:00.000Z	usr13	shift1	Auto-login is not so bad, (others would dissagree, but....).
2008-01-28T23:10:00.000Z	usr13	shift1	Try the ogther flash player.
2008-01-28T23:12:00.000Z	usr13	shift1	Just install Shockwave Flash
2008-01-28T23:51:00.000Z	usr13	shift1	sudo apt-get install vlc
