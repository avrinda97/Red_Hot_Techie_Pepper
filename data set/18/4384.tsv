2009-04-21T07:53:00.000Z	juls4		Hi guys, I'm trying to add an undetected resolution following this support article: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Config/Resolution However I'm stuck on 'You may create a modeline using the gtf or cvt utility.' how do i do this?
2009-04-21T07:54:00.000Z	unop	juls4	 gtf 1152 768 75
2009-04-21T07:55:00.000Z	juls4	unop	what do I do with that?

2009-04-21T07:59:00.000Z	juls4	unop	cheers mate :)
2009-04-21T08:11:00.000Z	juls4	unop	are you still here?
2009-04-21T08:11:00.000Z	unop	juls4	aye
2009-04-21T08:12:00.000Z	juls4	unop	I've got my modeline now. Should I put this in my xorg.conf or follow the guide and create a 'newmode'
2009-04-21T08:13:00.000Z	unop	juls4	I would do that the guide says
2009-04-21T08:13:00.000Z	juls4	unop	i tried that and all i get in terminal is a help file on xrandr with all of its options. it doesn't seem to work.
2009-04-21T08:14:00.000Z	unop	juls4	so where are you stuck now?
2009-04-21T08:16:00.000Z	juls4	unop	http://pastebin.com/d1ebace8
2009-04-21T08:17:00.000Z	juls4	unop	am i doing it correctly?
2009-04-21T08:17:00.000Z	unop	juls4	err no .. that line that gtf generated was supposed to be put into the xorg.conf file
2009-04-21T08:18:00.000Z	unop	juls4	are you sure you are following the guide properly? :)
2009-04-21T08:20:00.000Z	juls4	unop	oh... ? I think i'm reading it correctly; under adding undetected resolutions: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Config/Resolution I am a total noob to linux/ubuntu though.
2009-04-21T08:21:00.000Z	unop	juls4	oh, i see .. well, something like this then.  xrandr --newmode "1024x768" 63.50  1024 1072 1176 1328   768  771  775 798 -hsync +vsync
2009-04-21T08:22:00.000Z	juls4	unop	okay mate i'll give it a crack. thank you.
