2009-07-13T19:20:00.000Z	Xubuntnoob	frostburn	http://pastebin.com/d146002f9 gets me the same results?
2009-07-13T19:21:00.000Z	frostburn	Xubuntnoob	what's the output you're seeing? are you sure that it's stdout and not stderr?

2009-07-13T19:22:00.000Z	Xubuntnoob	frostburn	to be clear ** the program actually runs just fine
2009-07-13T19:23:00.000Z	frostburn	Xubuntnoob	that looks like stderr, if you want to redirect that as well, use the guide i pasted and redirect stderr
2009-07-13T19:24:00.000Z	Xubuntnoob	frostburn	thanks i'll have a look
2009-07-13T19:30:00.000Z	Xubuntnoob	frostburn	thanks. this works fantastic.  i'm trying to troubleshoot another problem i have with similar issues, can i create filters to separate the different error messages?

2009-07-13T19:33:00.000Z	frostburn	Xubuntnoob	ignore case
2009-07-13T19:36:00.000Z	Xubuntnoob	frostburn	would this work?  wine eve.exe | grep -i "fixme" > /home/logs/eve.log   if i want to ignore the fixme errors and have everything else goto the log?
2009-07-13T19:37:00.000Z	frostburn	Xubuntnoob	if you want to ignore "fix me"  use grep -v "fixme"
