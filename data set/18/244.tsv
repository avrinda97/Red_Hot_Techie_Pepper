2012-09-23T15:12:00.000Z	Surio		Hello room, Installed Ubuntu 12.04 desktop using VMWare player 5.0
2012-09-23T15:12:00.000Z	Surio		Now I am facing a problem with this
2012-09-23T15:13:00.000Z	WarOfTheNerd	Surio	what is the problem? :)
2012-09-23T15:14:00.000Z	WarOfTheNerd	Surio	choose Unity 2D from the list on the login screen
2012-09-23T15:15:00.000Z	WarOfTheNerd	Surio	you see next to the username there's like a mini Ubuntu logo?   Click it and see if you can pick Unity 2D
2012-09-23T15:16:00.000Z	WarOfTheNerd	Surio	the reason it's not working so well is because until VMWare Tools is installed; 3D graphics does not work.  Unity needs 3D graphics by default on 12.04, once you've chosen Unity 2D it should work :)
2012-09-23T15:18:00.000Z	WarOfTheNerd	Surio	Ubuntu 12.10 will be out soon; that will fix that issue by using the processor to make 3D if the graphics drivers do not support 3D
2012-09-23T15:18:00.000Z	WarOfTheNerd	Surio	what is the question? :)
2012-09-23T15:19:00.000Z	WarOfTheNerd	Surio	maybe the VMWare Tools drivers are broken at the moment.  They seem to be broken on Windows 8
2012-09-23T15:26:00.000Z	WarOfTheNerd	Surio	1 sec lemme check
2012-09-23T15:35:00.000Z	WarOfTheNerd	Surio	none since last outage
2012-09-23T15:41:00.000Z	WarOfTheNerd	Surio	if it says Reinstall, it's all good :)
2012-09-23T15:41:00.000Z	WarOfTheNerd	Surio	it just means that VMWare Tools has broken 3D graphics at the moment
2012-09-23T15:42:00.000Z	WarOfTheNerd	Surio	which to be honest, I've found VMWare Player 5 is broken
2012-09-23T15:43:00.000Z	WarOfTheNerd	Surio	4 was awesome, but I've had weirdness with 5
2012-09-23T15:44:00.000Z	WarOfTheNerd	Surio	yeah, and try reinstalling Ubuntu from scratch with it
2012-09-23T15:44:00.000Z	WarOfTheNerd	Surio	see if it works any better
2012-09-23T15:46:00.000Z	WarOfTheNerd	Surio	yeah the interface is the same
