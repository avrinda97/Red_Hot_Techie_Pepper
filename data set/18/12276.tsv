2011-02-23T04:13:00.000Z	Noxes		Hello, I'd like some help with a wireless card problem.
2011-02-23T04:14:00.000Z	Noxes		I was running ubuntu 10.10 before, and I had my RT3090pci wireless card working perfectly. I decided to reinstall Ubuntu, but everytime I restarted after installing the drivers, it wouldn't work at all.. I checked "lspci" and instead of displaying the Ralink 3090 info, it just says "Device d8dc:f8d8" and lshw said it's "unclaimed".
2011-02-23T04:15:00.000Z	Noxes		I've searched google along with the ubuntu forums to no avail.
2011-02-23T04:16:00.000Z	Noxes		Excuse me?
2011-02-23T04:18:00.000Z	Noxes		Yes, multiple times, but since I reinstalled ubuntu, it's just been sitting as Ubuntu 10.10 normally, without upgrades.
2011-02-23T04:19:00.000Z	Noxes		It's currently set as a Mint install though, I wanted to see if another distro would help.. I plan to install back to ubuntu.. But either way it still displays a weird device name in lspci, and drivers will not work.
2011-02-23T04:19:00.000Z	ikonia	Noxes	if it's mint we can't help
2011-02-23T04:20:00.000Z	ikonia	Noxes	ok
2011-02-23T04:28:00.000Z	ikonia	Noxes	ok , lspci is just based on psci-id's so that's not something to worry about
2011-02-23T04:29:00.000Z	ikonia	Noxes	possibly the livecd's pci-id's are out of date
2011-02-23T04:31:00.000Z	ikonia	Noxes	are the drivers normally supplied from the aditional drivers tool or a manual install ?
2011-02-23T04:32:00.000Z	ikonia	Noxes	define doesn't work
2011-02-23T04:33:00.000Z	ikonia	Noxes	do the modules you installed/built get loaded ?
2011-02-23T04:34:00.000Z	ikonia	Noxes	what is the name of the modules you built/installed
2011-02-23T04:35:00.000Z	ikonia	Noxes	ok, so lsmod should list that module if it's getting loaded
2011-02-23T04:36:00.000Z	ikonia	Noxes	manually load it
2011-02-23T04:37:00.000Z	ikonia	Noxes	is it getting loaded first ?
2011-02-23T04:37:00.000Z	ikonia	Noxes	I find it prudent to test it before saying it doesn't work, you've just told me "they don't work" yet you've not even installed ubuntu yet
