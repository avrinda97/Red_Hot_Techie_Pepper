2012-03-02T10:01:00.000Z	GhostWolf		does anyone know how to enable laptop mode in 11.10 without doing it in terminal?
2012-03-02T10:02:00.000Z	hopstafarian	GhostWolf	crontab -e and @restart line?
2012-03-02T10:03:00.000Z	GhostWolf	hopstafarian	i don't want a command line to type in terminal.
2012-03-02T10:03:00.000Z	hopstafarian	GhostWolf	you want it to start in laptop mode by default?
2012-03-02T10:03:00.000Z	GhostWolf	hopstafarian	i want to enable laptop mode so i can enable power saving mode
2012-03-02T10:04:00.000Z	hopstafarian	GhostWolf	so yes, by default, or just whenever, but through gui?
2012-03-02T10:05:00.000Z	GhostWolf	hopstafarian	yes by defualt so when there is no activity by me for like 5 mins my monitor just shuts down and i can turn it back on with my mouse. and yes through gui.
2012-03-02T10:09:00.000Z	hopstafarian	GhostWolf	when i upgraded to 11.10, my backlit kb ceased to light up...i was able fire it up w/ a cli string, but obviously not preferable...the solution was to "crontab -e" (as root), and then add a line that read "@restart <cli string>...now it works the backlit keyboard works all the time, even prior to gui login...this is what you're looking for, w/ <command string> = the laptop-mode command string...once entered, boot into that by default?
2012-03-02T10:11:00.000Z	hopstafarian	GhostWolf	you type it once into the crontab (scheduler) file, and then it does it as part of the bootup evertime...never have to type it agin...that's why i asked if it was by default or 'on demand'?
2012-03-02T10:12:00.000Z	GhostWolf	hopstafarian	i don't boot my pc up everytime i need to use it.
2012-03-02T10:13:00.000Z	hopstafarian	GhostWolf	i'm sorry man...i guess i don't unnerstan the ?
2012-03-02T10:13:00.000Z	hopstafarian	GhostWolf	i apologize
2012-03-02T10:13:00.000Z	GhostWolf	hopstafarian	you do know what power saving mode is?
2012-03-02T10:15:00.000Z	hopstafarian	GhostWolf	so, if you WERE to type it into the command line (which i heard that you don't want to do)...how would you chuck that wood, if you could?
2012-03-02T10:15:00.000Z	GhostWolf	hopstafarian	what?
2012-03-02T10:16:00.000Z	GhostWolf	hopstafarian	and yes i know its linux. but if i was going to do things via command line i'd would choose something other than ubuntu as the linux distro
2012-03-02T10:17:00.000Z	GhostWolf	hopstafarian	its not a command line i am talking about.. im trying to enable power saving mode, someone else said to enable laptop mode, and all searches and even the guy who mentioned it says he only does it via command
2012-03-02T10:22:00.000Z	hopstafarian	GhostWolf	can't speak for anyone but me, but don't think it's funny, and there's a reason that gui exist, and is good for a lot of things....but i don't know the gui fix, but i might have a handle on a fix outside the gui, that once it's fixed...but have to know what command line you wanted to execute...it sounded like you knew and if not hey...i don't either, that's what i'm trying to figure out...is it laptop-mode, etc.?
