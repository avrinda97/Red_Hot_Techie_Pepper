2007-10-09T10:06:00.000Z	djm62	frojnd	is it definitely still mounted?
2007-10-09T10:00:00.000Z	djm62	frojnd	lsof | grep yourdrive
2007-10-09T10:01:00.000Z	djm62	frojnd	might need options on lsof
2007-10-09T10:03:00.000Z	frojnd	djm62	hm... I tryed lsof | grep /dev/sdc1 but still this error: An application is preventing the volume from being unmounted.
2007-10-09T10:04:00.000Z	djm62	frojnd	what output does lsof | grep sdc1 give you?
2007-10-09T10:04:00.000Z	frojnd	djm62	none
2007-10-09T10:04:00.000Z	djm62	frojnd	just grep sdc1, not /dev/sdc1
2007-10-09T10:05:00.000Z	frojnd	djm62	still nothing...
2007-10-09T10:05:00.000Z	djm62	frojnd	oh.... that ain't good
2007-10-09T10:05:00.000Z	frojnd	djm62	hm.. yes very interesting :=
2007-10-09T10:07:00.000Z	frojnd	djm62	yesm cause I can still delete files from it..
2007-10-09T10:08:00.000Z	djm62	frojnd	my guess would be that nautilus is sitting on it, but I really don't know how
2007-10-09T10:08:00.000Z	frojnd	djm62	so logout will help..
2007-10-09T10:08:00.000Z	djm62	frojnd	feel like risking just pulling it out
2007-10-09T10:09:00.000Z	djm62	frojnd	? or if you don't want to, you can try logging out - lsof not showing anything is weird though
2007-10-09T10:10:00.000Z	frojnd	djm62	i've killed opera... and it unmounted ...
2007-10-09T10:11:00.000Z	djm62	frojnd	oh - leaving us none the wiser but at least you're sorted
2007-10-09T10:12:00.000Z	frojnd	djm62	I got a flash in my mind that I was downloading indirect to flash drive :)
