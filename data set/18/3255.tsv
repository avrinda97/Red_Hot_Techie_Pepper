2012-05-08T00:52:00.000Z	diegoviola		my gf is trying ubuntu for first time but she can't establish PPPoE connection
2012-05-08T00:54:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	diegoviola	Is your gf  using a modem or a modem/ router?
2012-05-08T00:55:00.000Z	diegoviola	Stereocaulon	she says that it says "connection established" but when she tries to browse something in Firefox it doesn't connect for her
2012-05-08T00:55:00.000Z	diegoviola	Stereocaulon	modem
2012-05-08T00:56:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	diegoviola	how is your modem connected to your computer?
2012-05-08T00:56:00.000Z	diegoviola	Stereocaulon	i suspect something to do with the gateway?
2012-05-08T00:57:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	diegoviola	could be the gateway, please pastebin sudo ifconfig
2012-05-08T00:57:00.000Z	diegoviola	Stereocaulon	ok i will tell her to do that
2012-05-08T00:58:00.000Z	diegoviola	Stereocaulon	thanks for the help
2012-05-08T00:59:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	diegoviola	I've been on an ADSL helpdesk for 7 years. If you want me to, I can help you on PM
2012-05-08T01:01:00.000Z	diegoviola	Stereocaulon	thanks
2012-05-08T01:01:00.000Z	diegoviola	Stereocaulon	unfortunately the help is not for me, it's for my gf :-)
2012-05-08T01:01:00.000Z	diegoviola	Stereocaulon	thanks for the help though
2012-05-08T01:02:00.000Z	diegoviola	Stereocaulon	i will get her to buy a router or something
2012-05-08T01:02:00.000Z	diegoviola	Stereocaulon	i guess it will be easier for her
2012-05-08T01:02:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	diegoviola	she can contact me on this channel after half an hour. I'm taking a shower now, after that, I have one hour left.
