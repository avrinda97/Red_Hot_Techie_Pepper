2009-01-09T12:01:00.000Z	Rudd-O	tritium	okay, dude, but chill out, it's just a word
2009-01-09T12:01:00.000Z	tritium	Rudd-O	channel policy
2009-01-09T12:02:00.000Z	Rudd-O	tritium	policy must match reality, not the other way around . nickrud: do you really think foreign language dudes will mind me saying a few cuss words?
2009-01-09T12:02:00.000Z	tritium	Rudd-O	and reality is that ubuntu is popular, and used by children.  Keep it family friendly.
2009-01-09T12:04:00.000Z	Rudd-O	tritium	nickrud: you have a right to set up the policy.  I also have a right to CRITICIZE the policy.
2009-01-09T12:04:00.000Z	tritium	Rudd-O	doesn't matter.  You still have to *abide* by channel policy inside the channel.  Now, move on.
2009-01-09T12:04:00.000Z	Rudd-O	tritium	I am now, so I don't see why you have to repeat it.
