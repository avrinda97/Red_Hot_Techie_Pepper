2007-07-03T11:30:00.000Z	stefg	bobgill	looka t /etc/iftab
2007-07-03T11:30:00.000Z	bobgill	stefg	ok I got it
2007-07-03T11:30:00.000Z	bobgill	stefg	it shows my mac address
2007-07-03T11:31:00.000Z	stefg	bobgill	/etc/iftab determines which mac address gets what interface name
2007-07-03T11:32:00.000Z	bobgill	stefg	ok.. how do I use this though to set an IP for my networked pc .. I can't find it in the linksys menu :(
2007-07-03T11:34:00.000Z	stefg	bobgill	this depends on your routers capability. it's got to support arp-locking if you always want to get the same addressvia dhcp
2007-07-03T11:35:00.000Z	stefg	bobgill	if you just want a manually chosen IP for the box, skip dhcp altogether and just state it in the network-control applet
2007-07-03T11:38:00.000Z	bobgill	stefg	ok I am in system> admin > network settings or network tools ?
2007-07-03T11:38:00.000Z	stefg	bobgill	network settings
2007-07-03T11:39:00.000Z	bobgill	stefg	ok I am here.. I have Wired Connection address: dhcp and Modem connection not configure
2007-07-03T11:39:00.000Z	stefg	bobgill	so choose properties for the wired connection and set to fixed or static (however this translates)
2007-07-03T11:40:00.000Z	bobgill	stefg	ok so if I set a static IP how does this affect my networked PC?
2007-07-03T11:41:00.000Z	stefg	bobgill	i do not understand the question. what is your networked PC? the one you're sitting at right now?
2007-07-03T11:42:00.000Z	bobgill	stefg	sorry.. I have Feisty (This box) and a networked XP PC .. so I am wondering if I set a static IP is this the IP for all computers using my router? or just this one?
2007-07-03T11:44:00.000Z	stefg	bobgill	your router has an IP, and each of the PCs has an ip of it's own. If you tell your 'server' to not get an IP from the 'boss' (router) that doesn't affect the other ones. actually it's quite smart to have a fixed IP for the server,
2007-07-03T11:45:00.000Z	bobgill	stefg	ok I think I am understanding.. so each pc = server right ? so then say I set this one to x.x.x.x, this will be the IP for this computer but the networked XP PC will stay as 192.168.1.105 ??
2007-07-03T11:48:00.000Z	stefg	bobgill	we're just about to dive into a TCP/IP networking howto, which is beyond the scope of this channel.  read http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=25557
