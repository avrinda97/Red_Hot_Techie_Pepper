2009-04-06T15:53:00.000Z	wtv		my right mouse button isn't working. any ideas?
2009-04-06T15:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wtv	are you running compiz?
2009-04-06T15:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wtv	i'd jump in #compiz, it breaks stuff like that
2009-04-06T15:55:00.000Z	wtv	ActionParsnip	it doesn't :( i used metacity --replace as command
2009-04-06T15:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wtv	ok if you run xev in a terminal and right click in the little white box, does it create events?
2009-04-06T15:57:00.000Z	wtv	ActionParsnip	you mean i execute 'xev' in terminal? nothing appeared
2009-04-06T15:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wtv	try typing on the keyboard with terminal highlighted
2009-04-06T15:58:00.000Z	wtv	ActionParsnip	ok it did. nothing happens when i click right mouse button. left one works
2009-04-06T15:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wtv	sounds like mouse settings are wonky then, if xev isnt reacting to the click then no input is being registered
2009-04-06T15:59:00.000Z	wtv	ActionParsnip	it worked till a couple of days before
2009-04-06T16:59:00.000Z	wtv	ActionParsnip	as it turns out, my mouse has gone bad. i tried running it in other OS's but doesnt work. thanks :)
2009-04-06T16:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wtv	np bro
2009-04-23T15:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wtv	dvd has a lot more language support on the disk as well as (i think) the other DEs
2009-04-23T15:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wtv	but you can get it all once you get installed and online
2009-04-23T15:47:00.000Z	wtv	ActionParsnip	does it have more optional packages
2009-04-23T15:47:00.000Z	wtv	ActionParsnip	i intend to install it on PCs not connected
2009-04-23T15:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wtv	no not really, for a desktop PC in english using a single DE, it has everything you need. I download the DVD ISO as I can't find CD media around me for love nor money
2009-04-23T15:49:00.000Z	wtv	ActionParsnip	it doesn't have codecs
