2011-04-27T05:08:00.000Z	escott	Bluebill-Wolf	although it doesn't stream so much as record
2011-04-27T05:10:00.000Z	escott	Bluebill-Wolf	where would you stream to? do you want to stream to another computer, then maybe a vnc type thing
2011-04-27T05:10:00.000Z	escott	Bluebill-Wolf	sorry don't know what Ustream is
2011-04-27T05:10:00.000Z	escott	Bluebill-Wolf	is this TV?
2011-04-27T05:12:00.000Z	escott	Bluebill-Wolf	you want to record from ustream or push to ustream
2011-04-27T05:14:00.000Z	escott	Bluebill-Wolf	a lot of people record from vnc and you could probably pipe that through a converter and push it up
