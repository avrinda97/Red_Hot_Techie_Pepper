2006-06-30T10:39:00.000Z	Warbo	intelligi	System Tools>Configuration Editor
2006-06-30T10:39:00.000Z	Warbo	intelligi	Applications menu in GNOME
2006-06-30T10:40:00.000Z	Warbo	intelligi	Applications>Accessories>Alacarte
2006-06-30T10:42:00.000Z	Warbo	intelligi	Maybe
2006-06-30T10:43:00.000Z	Warbo	intelligi	Erm. By dragging it? I don;t know but there is no point asking "can I" when you may as well have a go
2006-06-30T10:45:00.000Z	Warbo	intelligi	The way I was going to suggest it to use Alacarte to turn on the Configuration Editor, then open it and go apps>nautilus>desktop and turn on the trash icon
2006-07-04T05:09:00.000Z	Warbo	intelligi	Search for java in synaptic or aptitude
2006-07-04T05:12:00.000Z	Warbo	intelligi	Check Settings>Repositories and make sure the top one has multiverse ticked
2006-07-04T05:13:00.000Z	intelligi	Warbo	I have everything clicked. There is no sun-java5.
2006-07-04T05:14:00.000Z	Warbo	intelligi	Dump your /etc/apt/sources.list into a pastebin then :)
2006-07-04T05:21:00.000Z	Warbo	intelligi	You don't have multiverse enabled
2006-07-04T05:21:00.000Z	Warbo	intelligi	I will edit your list and paste it back........
2006-07-04T05:23:00.000Z	Warbo	intelligi	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/17155
2006-07-23T07:02:00.000Z	Warbo	intelligi	Nautilus
2006-07-23T07:03:00.000Z	Warbo	intelligi	Go to "burn:///" to make data CDs, or right click on iso files
2006-07-23T07:04:00.000Z	Warbo	intelligi	You may need some nautilus extension packages. Or just use GnomeBaker of K3B
