2010-08-18T03:16:00.000Z	hiku	lov255	it's not pine anymore it's called "alpine"
2010-08-18T03:17:00.000Z	hiku	lov255	so run - sudo apt-get install alpine and your all set.
2010-08-18T03:18:00.000Z	hiku	lov255	yes
2010-08-18T03:18:00.000Z	hiku	lov255	you could also make an alias in ~/.bashrc to use the name pine instead =). thats what I did anyway
2010-08-18T03:20:00.000Z	hiku	lov255	like multi-monitor support? yes if your graphics card can support it.
2010-08-18T03:22:00.000Z	hiku	lov255	there is already a small app called "workspace switcher" that will do that for you.
2010-08-18T03:26:00.000Z	hiku	lov255	it's already installed. are you using gnome as your desktop?
2010-08-18T03:27:00.000Z	lov255	hiku	yes I am using GNOME - what is the command for it?
2010-08-18T03:28:00.000Z	hiku	lov255	right click the bottom bar and choose add to panel, then scroll down to the bottom and choose workspace switcher.
