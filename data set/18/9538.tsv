2007-03-23T13:16:00.000Z	hobbes487		hello everyone.  can someone help me out?
2007-03-23T13:17:00.000Z	soundray	hobbes487	picking up your room? Taking the garbage out?
2007-03-23T13:18:00.000Z	soundray	hobbes487	what kind of CD and what version do you have?
2007-03-23T13:20:00.000Z	soundray	hobbes487	what kind of CPU is in your system?
2007-03-23T13:20:00.000Z	soundray	hobbes487	please highlight your replies for me by using my nick
2007-03-23T13:21:00.000Z	hobbes487	soundray	AMD Atholon 64
2007-03-23T13:23:00.000Z	soundray	hobbes487	early boot failures like yours are often due to bad memory. Try the memtest86 boot option and let it run for a while.
2007-03-23T13:23:00.000Z	hobbes487	soundray	ok, i'll try that
2007-03-23T14:00:00.000Z	hobbes487	soundray	i ran the memory test for half an hour.  I still have the same problem:  Hangs on 'Booting the Kernel' after selecting stsrt of install Ubuntu
2007-03-23T14:01:00.000Z	soundray	hobbes487	ha, you remind me of the guy who says 'I had an ultrasound scan, but it didn't make me feel better, either' :)
2007-03-23T14:01:00.000Z	soundray	hobbes487	did the screen stay blue during the memtest?
2007-03-23T14:02:00.000Z	hobbes487	soundray	yes
2007-03-23T14:03:00.000Z	soundray	hobbes487	there are a few boot options you could try out: noapic nolapic
2007-03-23T14:20:00.000Z	hobbes487	soundray	i tried adding the noapic aolpic boot options with no change
2007-03-23T14:22:00.000Z	soundray	hobbes487	two things (I'm leaving soon): check that your CD is okay (there is an entry for it in the boot menu), and if it is, you should try i386. It is marginally slower than amd64, but causes fewer problems in general.
2007-03-23T14:23:00.000Z	hobbes487	soundray	when i try to check the CD i have the same problem
2007-03-23T14:24:00.000Z	soundray	hobbes487	then there's definitely something wrong with it.
2007-03-23T14:24:00.000Z	hobbes487	soundray	ok.  i'll try burning it again.  thank
