2008-01-31T13:20:00.000Z	soneil	bluefoxx	dd if=theimage of=/dev/yourfloppy  (I don't know what devices floppies are, and you really, really want to doublecheck it before you splat data across it)
2008-01-31T13:21:00.000Z	soneil	bluefoxx	dd replacing their rawrite instruction
2008-01-31T13:21:00.000Z	bluefoxx	soneil	ok, tyvm X3
2008-01-31T13:22:00.000Z	soneil	bluefoxx	I can't stress the doublecheck bit enough.  I've written a 1.44Mb image over the front of a harddrive before.  it made me cry.
2008-01-31T13:23:00.000Z	bluefoxx	soneil	ouch, it wasnt your main hdd was it?
2008-01-31T13:23:00.000Z	soneil	bluefoxx	one and only
2008-01-31T13:24:00.000Z	bluefoxx	soneil	eek, that had to hurt[i think i would cry too, given 60 gigs of video and 20 of games, 7 of music], BTW, how do i find the device path for my floppy?
2008-01-31T13:26:00.000Z	soneil	bluefoxx	I'm pretty sure it's /dev/fd* ... my favourite is to put a floppy in, then file -s /dev/thatdevice and see if the floppy starts making fun noises.  it's harmless if it's wrong.
2008-01-31T13:26:00.000Z	bluefoxx	soneil	ok, that sounds good
2008-01-31T13:27:00.000Z	bluefoxx	soneil	ok, got it, its /dev/fd0
2008-01-31T13:27:00.000Z	soneil	bluefoxx	I impress myself.  I haven't had a floppy drive since 1998 :)
2008-01-31T13:27:00.000Z	bluefoxx	soneil	[strangly my floppy disk drive is about 10 years old and it still works great, dead silent too]
2008-01-31T13:28:00.000Z	soneil	bluefoxx	it was never the drives that irked me.  it was finding doghair inside any disk that held valuable data
2008-01-31T13:30:00.000Z	bluefoxx	soneil	lol, i have cats but that was living with my parents, i moved out last year and live with my grandfather now, no pets here[no fuzzy kitties but there i had no awesome computer to learn from and give me a career, lol], anyways, thanks for the help, ill give my new disk a try and let you know if it worked
