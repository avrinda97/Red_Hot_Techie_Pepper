2010-08-13T23:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		ezrafree: the make and model are moot. You need to know the chip inside
2010-08-13T23:05:00.000Z	ezrafree_	ActionParsnip	how can i find this info out?
2010-08-13T23:06:00.000Z	ezrafree_	ActionParsnip	thanks i'll try. may take a sec cause i have to switch my wireless keyboard over to that computer to do it, so brb :)
2010-08-13T23:09:00.000Z	ezrafree_	ActionParsnip	where in this output would it say the chipset?
2010-08-13T23:10:00.000Z	ezrafree_	ActionParsnip	strange, i have a product: line on the first *-network (my wired adapter) but not on the second one for my usb wifi adapter
2010-08-13T23:13:00.000Z	ezrafree_	ActionParsnip	yes i have access points (mine and two others in the area) showing up from that command
2010-08-13T23:15:00.000Z	ezrafree_	ActionParsnip	it's wlan0
2010-08-13T23:17:00.000Z	ezrafree_	ActionParsnip	yes i can see the access point there as well
2010-08-13T23:19:00.000Z	ezrafree_	ActionParsnip	but if i try to connect to it, it just tries to authenticate and then brings up the Authentication Required window again after awhile
2010-08-13T23:20:00.000Z	ezrafree_	ActionParsnip	yes, it's WPA WPA2 Personal
2010-08-13T23:20:00.000Z	ezrafree_	ActionParsnip	i'm connected to it fine through the windows machine i am using to talk to you now
2010-08-13T23:20:00.000Z	ezrafree_	ActionParsnip	using the same card
2010-08-13T23:21:00.000Z	ezrafree_	ActionParsnip	well the card definitely supports WPA WPA2 Personal, since it's working under that security method in another box
2010-08-13T23:22:00.000Z	ezrafree_	ActionParsnip	so you're saying ubuntu won't support WPA/WPA2 Personal?
2010-08-13T23:23:00.000Z	ezrafree_	ActionParsnip	and for some reason i can't figure out what chip this adapter uses... hmm
2010-08-13T23:25:00.000Z	ezrafree_	ActionParsnip	okay, i'll give it a shot. i really prefer the security of WPA to WEP though
2010-08-13T23:26:00.000Z	ezrafree_	ActionParsnip	yeah, i know. and i'd buy a better card if i weren't so completely broke right now.
2010-08-13T23:26:00.000Z	ezrafree_	ActionParsnip	unfortunately i just moved to denver heh
