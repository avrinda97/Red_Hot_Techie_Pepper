2010-06-18T12:39:00.000Z	HermanDE_	smily	Sure....
2010-06-18T12:41:00.000Z	HermanDE_	smily	How old is your computer?
2010-06-18T12:43:00.000Z	HermanDE_	smily	What type of computer do you wish wireless on?
2010-06-18T12:43:00.000Z	HermanDE_	smily	Is it a laptop?
2010-06-18T12:43:00.000Z	HermanDE_	smily	Is the wireless built in or is it a usb device?
2010-06-18T12:45:00.000Z	HermanDE_	smily	Are you in Starbucks?  :)
2010-06-18T12:46:00.000Z	HermanDE_	smily	How is the wireless connected to the computer?
2010-06-18T12:48:00.000Z	HermanDE_	smily	So....  Is the computer connected to a router with a cable?
2010-06-18T12:49:00.000Z	HermanDE_	smily	Are you running the newest Ubuntu?
2010-06-18T12:50:00.000Z	HermanDE_	smily	Are you running the standard GNOME?
2010-06-18T12:51:00.000Z	HermanDE_	smily	At the top right of the screen do you see a small icon that may look like a radar scan?
2010-06-18T12:53:00.000Z	HermanDE_	smily	right click on it....  Is wireless active?
2010-06-18T12:56:00.000Z	HermanDE_	smily	There are a couple types of wireless devices.....
2010-06-18T12:56:00.000Z	HermanDE_	smily	It could be that you have an 802.11b device and the router is configured for WPA....
2010-06-18T12:58:00.000Z	HermanDE_	smily	Now you need to determine if your WIFI device can handle the WEP version.....
2010-06-18T12:59:00.000Z	HermanDE_	smily	If your wifi device can ohly hold 40 characters for a WEP....  And the router has a 64 character string....  Game is over....
2010-06-18T12:59:00.000Z	HermanDE_	smily	Then there is the question between HEX and ascii.....
