2008-09-26T22:48:00.000Z	Letterbomb05		Hi can anyone help me setup ndiswrapper-1.53 on ubuntu? The manuals on the ubuntu site are all for 1.43, and don't work.
2008-09-26T22:49:00.000Z	biouser	Letterbomb05	I could try.. wireless can be a real pain, I am just now getting mine half-way sorted out...
2008-09-26T22:50:00.000Z	biouser	Letterbomb05	I actually don't know anything about ndiswrapper...
2008-09-26T22:53:00.000Z	biouser	Letterbomb05	have you tried ndisgtk?
2008-09-26T22:53:00.000Z	Letterbomb05	biouser	I installed it
2008-09-26T22:54:00.000Z	Letterbomb05	biouser	whats the sudo apt-get install for that?
2008-09-26T22:55:00.000Z	biouser	Letterbomb05	ndisgtk
2008-09-26T22:57:00.000Z	Letterbomb05	biouser	It tells me I have the driver installed
2008-09-26T22:57:00.000Z	biouser	Letterbomb05	you are using network-manager default?
2008-09-26T22:58:00.000Z	Letterbomb05	biouser	not sure?
2008-09-26T22:58:00.000Z	biouser	Letterbomb05	I was f-ing with mine for a long time last night and I am using the wireless now after reinstallin network-manager and rebooting without the ethernet plugged in....
2008-09-26T22:59:00.000Z	Letterbomb05	biouser	how do I reinstall network-manager
2008-09-26T23:00:00.000Z	biouser	Letterbomb05	I just used synaptic, I don't really think that's what helped necesarily...
2008-09-26T23:00:00.000Z	Letterbomb05	biouser	well It says the drivers are installed, so what would you recommend I do?
2008-09-26T23:01:00.000Z	biouser	Letterbomb05	have you tried booting without the ethernet plugged in?  I know it sounds lame...
2008-09-26T23:01:00.000Z	Letterbomb05	biouser	I think I have, but i'll try again.
2008-09-26T23:06:00.000Z	Letterbomb05	biouser	It did nothing.
2008-09-26T23:12:00.000Z	biouser	Letterbomb05	yeah, that was a long shot... one time switching to knetworkmanager helped me but that is not very sound advice either.... sry that you are struggling with wireless I was smacking myself in the head last night over it
