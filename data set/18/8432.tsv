2007-08-21T16:29:00.000Z	cafuego	ProphetPX	A somewhat better integrated Gnome desktop. Easy, ready to use.
2007-08-21T16:54:00.000Z	cafuego	ProphetPX	*maybe* there is a diver for the intel AGN cards, I asked yesterday but got no response.
2007-08-21T16:54:00.000Z	cafuego	ProphetPX	... it might not do "N" though, only A and G.
2007-08-21T16:54:00.000Z	ProphetPX	cafuego	 before coming here, I came from channel #ipw2100 and they said possibly .. in mini-pci-E form ... for newer laptops  :-\
2007-08-21T16:55:00.000Z	cafuego	ProphetPX	hardware4linux.info says otherwise
2007-08-21T16:55:00.000Z	cafuego	ProphetPX	Sorry, hardware4linux.info says yes :-)
2007-08-21T16:56:00.000Z	cafuego	ProphetPX	There would appear to be a iwl4965 module for it.
2007-08-21T16:56:00.000Z	cafuego	ProphetPX	At the end of th day, it is awfully new though,  so any support is likely to not yet be 100%.
