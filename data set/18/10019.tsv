2007-01-20T10:49:00.000Z	n2diy	alyssa_	don't mess with the loopback, what does ifconfig tell you about your network card?
2007-01-20T10:51:00.000Z	n2diy	alyssa_	don't mess with the loopback, what does ifconfig tell you about your network card?
2007-01-20T10:51:00.000Z	alyssa_	n2diy	ifconfig tells me I have a valid IP on the eth1 interface.
2007-01-20T10:52:00.000Z	n2diy	alyssa_	ok, that is what you want to play with, lo is used by the system, and you don't want to break it.
2007-01-20T10:52:00.000Z	alyssa_	n2diy	okie.
2007-01-20T10:53:00.000Z	n2diy	alyssa_	jewel, can you ping the ip address of eth1?
2007-01-20T10:54:00.000Z	alyssa_	n2diy	jewel, yes I can ping my IP and my host name now. And terminal loads faster too. Just dont see the connection between terminal loading and hosts file.
2007-01-20T10:56:00.000Z	n2diy	alyssa_	cool, I don't know what the hell we where trying to do, but glad it worked! :)

2007-01-20T11:02:00.000Z	alyssa_	n2diy	hhmm. okie. But what I was talking about is changing the boot up screen. Would you know how to do it?

2007-01-20T11:04:00.000Z	n2diy	alyssa_	No, I don' know how to do that.
