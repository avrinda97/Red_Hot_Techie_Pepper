2008-07-01T07:35:00.000Z	Maciel		I'm having problems with a REALLY old computer, an old version of Ubuntu and partitions: can anyone help?
2008-07-01T07:36:00.000Z	Maciel		well, I was stupid enough to not create partitions when I was installing, and I'm having problems creating one now
2008-07-01T07:37:00.000Z	Maciel		yeah
2008-07-01T07:37:00.000Z	Maciel		although, there may be a problem considering the drive is only about 8GB in size...
2008-07-01T07:38:00.000Z	Maciel		that's about right
2008-07-01T07:39:00.000Z	Maciel		although any kind of use on the drive would be good
2008-07-01T07:40:00.000Z	Maciel		I mean, use it for space for Windows... long story
2008-07-01T07:41:00.000Z	Maciel		the thing is, I'm using Ubuntu 5.06, so I don't have the GNOME partition programme that the later versions have and the help web pages recommend I use
