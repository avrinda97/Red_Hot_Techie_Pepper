2005-11-26T07:40:00.000Z	Urthmover		so freenx gives me better performance than vnc
2005-11-26T07:40:00.000Z	Urthmover		I was struggling getting something to forward X11
2005-11-26T07:40:00.000Z	Urthmover		couldn't get anything to work right
2005-11-26T07:41:00.000Z	Urthmover		do you think that is more stable performance than even FreeNX?
2005-11-26T07:43:00.000Z	Urthmover		well oskude we must not be communicating well...How does FreeNX make a difference with boot speed?
2005-11-26T07:44:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	Urthmover	if it has to start on boot
2005-11-26T07:45:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	Urthmover	step 1: ssh -X server
2005-11-26T07:48:00.000Z	Urthmover	HrdwrBoB	I get X: user not authorized to run the X server, aborting
2005-11-26T07:48:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	Urthmover	.. wtf
2005-11-26T07:50:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	Urthmover	you want the desktop that it's currently using?
2005-11-26T07:51:00.000Z	Urthmover	HrdwrBoB	what is the best way to connect to the desktop of my office ubuntu workstation?
2005-11-26T07:55:00.000Z	Urthmover	HrdwrBoB	ok so I guess freeNX is the best graphical remote app for linux
2005-11-26T07:55:00.000Z	HrdwrBoB	Urthmover	sort of
