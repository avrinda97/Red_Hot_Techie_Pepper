2010-06-11T03:35:00.000Z	dominicdinada		why does computer janitor remove things that should not be removed as nothing was set to remove such as google chrome
2010-06-11T03:35:00.000Z	dominicdinada		it just decided on its own "hey i want to mess up someones day I am gonna remove google chrome without any request to do so"
2010-06-11T03:37:00.000Z	dominicdinada		And I should feel so special because it has tried removing SQL workbench all the time :)
2010-06-11T03:38:00.000Z	dominicdinada		So why does it automatically decide what i should and should not keep on my computer

2010-06-11T03:40:00.000Z	soreau	dominicdinada	If you knew what to clean up and how, would you even need computer janitor?
2010-06-11T03:41:00.000Z	dominicdinada	soreau	Knowing is half the battle. and well It would be nice if the Janitor utility worked correctly eh ?
2010-06-11T03:41:00.000Z	soreau	dominicdinada	Your idea of correctly might not be the same of the developers idea of correctly
2010-06-11T03:53:00.000Z	dominicdinada	soreau	is there a way to force ubuntu to either disregard the kernel from the repo or force janitor to skip chrome/workbench... I mean honestly it is not like there is an ignore update,upgrade, ignore remove... And simply put as that stuff piles up you spend more time sifting through the crap you dont want changed to get to what you need
2010-06-11T03:54:00.000Z	soreau	dominicdinada	I have no idea since I dont use that janitor app. I just remove whatever I dont need manually
2010-08-31T09:36:00.000Z	dominicdinada	soreau	that is really outdated
2010-08-31T09:37:00.000Z	dominicdinada	soreau	heh

2010-08-31T09:40:00.000Z	dominicdinada	soreau	those are the core java engine names.
2010-08-31T09:41:00.000Z	dominicdinada	soreau	 Browser astronomer ? Cause the wiki is way outdated of the engine names ?
