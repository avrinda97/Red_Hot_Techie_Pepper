2010-11-21T02:35:00.000Z	merlin2049er		i've got trouble upgrading to 10.10
2010-11-21T02:36:00.000Z	merlin2049er		whats freerapid?
2010-11-21T02:38:00.000Z	merlin2049er		whats with "could not calculate the change?"
2010-11-21T02:38:00.000Z	merlin2049er		i can't upgrade
2010-11-21T02:38:00.000Z	Seveas	merlin2049er	that means you've confused apt. What are you trying to do?
2010-11-21T02:41:00.000Z	Seveas	merlin2049er	in the same place as where you see that error. Maybe a more info button? (Sorry, I don't know that gui very well, I upgrade from the CLI)
2010-11-21T02:42:00.000Z	Seveas	merlin2049er	sudo do-release-upgrade
2010-11-21T02:51:00.000Z	Seveas	merlin2049er	and nothing error like above that message?
2010-11-21T02:53:00.000Z	Seveas	merlin2049er	most likely reason is that a package from a 3rd party repo is messing things up
2010-11-21T03:03:00.000Z	Seveas	merlin2049er	does /var/log/dist-upgrade/apt.log provide any clues?
2010-11-21T03:04:00.000Z	Seveas	merlin2049er	or /var/log/dist-upgrade/main.log
2010-11-21T03:05:00.000Z	Seveas	merlin2049er	yeah. Did you install it from a nonstandard repo?
2010-11-21T03:11:00.000Z	Seveas	merlin2049er	rsync to another linux machine
2010-11-21T03:12:00.000Z	Seveas	merlin2049er	that works as well, as long as the external drive has a linux filesystem like ext3
2010-11-21T03:13:00.000Z	Seveas	merlin2049er	neh, but it's easy
2010-11-21T03:14:00.000Z	Seveas	merlin2049er	hehe
