2006-12-02T09:25:00.000Z	dsnyders	w30	I tried e2retrieve, but all it does is spit out 3 files.  I can find no docs on what to do with those files.
2006-12-02T09:21:00.000Z	w30	dsnyders	are all the superblocks bad?
2006-12-02T09:23:00.000Z	dsnyders	w30	fsck gives me errors on all the ones I've tried.
2006-12-02T09:24:00.000Z	w30	dsnyders	that's been my experience with alternate superblocks also, if one is bad they are all bad :=(
2006-12-02T09:27:00.000Z	w30	dsnyders	I could have said try an alternate superblock but that the only thing that I know to do. Maybe hit Google for ext3 or ext2 file corruption search. Sorry I am so dumb.
2006-12-02T09:28:00.000Z	w30	dsnyders	any think in the Lost and found directory?
2006-12-02T09:29:00.000Z	dsnyders	w30	stand by...
2006-12-02T09:31:00.000Z	dsnyders	w30	none of the lost and found folders contain any data.
2006-12-02T09:32:00.000Z	w30	dsnyders	darn if I know maybe Google Lost and Found directory will give you some hint of where to go?
2006-12-02T09:33:00.000Z	dsnyders	w30	any other recovery tools you could suggest?
2006-12-02T09:34:00.000Z	w30	dsnyders	I can't help you there.
2006-12-02T09:34:00.000Z	w30	dsnyders	sorry
2006-12-02T09:35:00.000Z	dsnyders	w30	that doesn't surprise me.  I've been googling for most of the week, and asking in half a dozen irc channels.  No joy.
2006-12-02T09:38:00.000Z	w30	dsnyders	have you called any hard drive repair stores or services like a business supply outfit that maybe could put you on track. They have customers that have really valuable data that can't afford to be lost.
2006-12-02T09:40:00.000Z	dsnyders	w30	I'll consider that option.
2006-12-02T09:40:00.000Z	w30	dsnyders	I have talked to a hard drive manufacturer when I had a disk fail under warranty and they have ways of recovery that probably cost you an arm and a leg but maybe they would at least talk to you free.
2011-07-31T04:05:00.000Z	w30	dsnyders	I looked at the back of a terminal on a screen at the Mayo Clinic and I saw a list of about 75 network addresses, ha!
2011-07-31T04:05:00.000Z	w30	dsnyders	pick one
