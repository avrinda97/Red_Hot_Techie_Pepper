2009-05-21T11:41:00.000Z	Tasbuntu		Hello all, I've been messing with my GRUB settings lately, and although I managed to get a splashscreen on it, the Ubuntu Bootup animation(the loading up bar?) seems to have broken. The bootup is now text based. Is there anyway to fix this?
2009-05-21T11:42:00.000Z	raylu	Tasbuntu	show us the boot line?
2009-05-21T11:44:00.000Z	raylu	Tasbuntu	the line that starts with "kernel" is what i meant
2009-05-21T11:45:00.000Z	raylu	Tasbuntu	no.. just get it out of your menu.lst
2009-05-21T11:48:00.000Z	raylu	Tasbuntu	do you need vga=795 to boot?
2009-05-21T11:51:00.000Z	raylu	Tasbuntu	by default, you only have splash and quiet
2009-05-21T11:51:00.000Z	raylu	Tasbuntu	so i assume you added vga=795 yourself
2009-05-21T11:52:00.000Z	raylu	Tasbuntu	i'd take out vga=795 from defoptions and then run "sudo update-grub"
2009-05-21T11:53:00.000Z	raylu	Tasbuntu	what about it?
2009-05-21T11:54:00.000Z	raylu	Tasbuntu	initrd is on its own line
2009-05-21T11:54:00.000Z	raylu	Tasbuntu	that specifies the strange strange ramfs thingy
2009-05-21T12:04:00.000Z	raylu	Tasbuntu	er... show me your menu.lst now?
2009-05-21T12:08:00.000Z	raylu	Tasbuntu	hrm. no idea then. by the way, the next time the kernel gets upgraded, update-grub is going to be run and vga=795 will be added back in because you didn't remove it from defoptions
2009-05-21T12:08:00.000Z	raylu	Tasbuntu	look for defoptions in menu.lst
2009-05-21T12:09:00.000Z	raylu	Tasbuntu	not really
2009-05-21T12:18:00.000Z	raylu	Tasbuntu	usplash?
2009-05-21T12:21:00.000Z	raylu	Tasbuntu	thinking is overrated
2009-05-29T12:05:00.000Z	raylu	Tasbuntu	you can address 4GB of virtual space, but not all of it is in RAM and some of it is reserved by the kernel
