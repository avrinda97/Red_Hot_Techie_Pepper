2011-03-29T03:44:00.000Z	AnassAhmed		but when I added 192.168.1.33  darelnadwa.com it didn't work
2011-03-29T03:44:00.000Z	AnassAhmed		I've a server in the same network
2011-03-29T03:45:00.000Z	AnassAhmed		I can't reach to it with the domain
2011-03-29T03:45:00.000Z	AnassAhmed		I want to reach to it by domain through adding this line to /etc/hosts
2011-03-29T03:46:00.000Z	AnassAhmed		yes, It's work from external
2011-03-29T03:46:00.000Z	AnassAhmed		but when I try to browse it from the same network
2011-03-29T03:46:00.000Z	AnassAhmed		I can't reach to it, because the router page appeared
2011-03-29T03:48:00.000Z	AnassAhmed		@rrconf: it worked with all progams except firefox
2011-03-29T03:49:00.000Z	AnassAhmed		@rrconf: yes, I think that, I removed the cash and the cookies but the problem is still
2011-03-29T03:51:00.000Z	AnassAhmed		@rrconf: but firefox redirect google.com to the IP in the /etc/hosts
2011-03-29T03:51:00.000Z	rcconf	AnassAhmed	check network settings in firefox
2011-03-29T03:45:00.000Z	rcconf	AnassAhmed	darelnadwa.com has address 41.196.174.204
2011-03-29T03:46:00.000Z	rcconf	AnassAhmed	maybe this will help you man resolv.conf
2011-03-29T03:48:00.000Z	AnassAhmed	rcconf	I think that I can edit /etc/hosts, and I edited it but it didn't work with darelnadwa.com but worked with google.com
2011-03-29T03:48:00.000Z	rcconf	AnassAhmed	try to add that site after google.com
2011-03-29T03:49:00.000Z	rcconf	AnassAhmed	maybe firefox is caching the DNS
2011-03-29T03:50:00.000Z	rcconf	AnassAhmed	you only have that problem in firefox?
2011-03-29T03:50:00.000Z	rcconf	AnassAhmed	join #firefox
