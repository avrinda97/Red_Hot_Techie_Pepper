2009-01-22T00:21:00.000Z	Slart		has the tracker/document indexer been removed from intrepid? or I have uninstalled it and forgot about it?
2009-01-22T00:21:00.000Z	Izinucs	Slart	you must have done it..
2009-01-22T00:21:00.000Z	Izinucs	Slart	or stopped it from starting in the first place..
2010-05-14T21:05:00.000Z	Slart	Izinucs	you're welcome
2010-06-07T21:40:00.000Z	Slart	Izinucs	/var/log/Xorg.0.log .. at the beginning
2010-06-07T21:41:00.000Z	Izinucs	Slart	wols thanks.. I'll look
2010-06-07T22:04:00.000Z	Izinucs	Slart	trying to fix my upgrade from 9.10 to 10.04.  I had the binary nvidia driver loaded during the upgrade and have been able to reinstall it once but need to do it again after uninstalling the ubuntu nvidia bits that conflict.. but issuing a sudo service gdm stop from TTY2 says "stop: Unknown instance:" yet the installer won't run because it thinks X is still running.. any help?
2010-06-07T22:05:00.000Z	Slart	Izinucs	hmm.. "sudo service gdm stop" works on my 10.04 machine... you could try  "sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop" as an alternative
2010-06-07T22:06:00.000Z	Izinucs	Slart	nope.. maybe I'll start gdm again and restop.. right now when going to ctrl+alt+F7  it shows thinks stuck on "battery state" but this is a desktop
2010-06-07T22:08:00.000Z	Izinucs	Slart	now it won't start.. just a screen flash and that's it.. reports "gdm start/running, process 2592" ... weird
2010-06-07T22:09:00.000Z	Slart	Izinucs	did you manage to install the video driver? you could check the file /var/log/Xorg.0.log to see if something interesting was logged
2010-06-07T22:09:00.000Z	Izinucs	Slart	I'll do that.
2010-06-07T22:11:00.000Z	Izinucs	Slart	says it couldn't find the module "nvidia" .. argggggg.
2010-06-07T22:11:00.000Z	Slart	Izinucs	but the nvidia binary driver install worked, right?
2010-06-07T22:13:00.000Z	Izinucs	Slart	yea.. I was having errors installing the latest trying to fix the upgrade then resorted to installing the same version driver which loaded or rather installed fine from the looks of it.. but I didn't test it.. I went directly to the new driver and installed that which removed the older driver.. then I was left here.. I think I need to reboot and try reinstalling one or the other again.
2010-06-07T22:13:00.000Z	Slart	Izinucs	yes.. try it again.. see if it helps.. nvidias installer has never given me any problems that a reboot and retry didn't solve
2010-06-07T22:14:00.000Z	Izinucs	Slart	me too.. since 6.06 :(
2010-06-07T22:14:00.000Z	Izinucs	Slart	brb..
