2006-06-03T12:35:00.000Z	rpedro	klormexor	what are you trying to do?
2006-06-03T12:35:00.000Z	klormexor	rpedro	for irc there is a name attached to my who is, can you see it? trying to take that off
2006-06-03T12:36:00.000Z	klormexor	rpedro	oh wait that was another issue, i have realplayer i installed in a folder and execute from, but shouldnt be there, instead in the folder where it belongs to, where all the other i.e=gaim,firestarter.. etc progs should be
2006-06-03T12:36:00.000Z	klormexor	rpedro	any idea where the main exe's are
2006-06-03T12:38:00.000Z	rpedro	klormexor	I don't think you really should be installing apps like that, you should use the package manager, or if it's something you compile it usually goes in the  /usr/local hierarchy
2006-06-03T12:40:00.000Z	klormexor	rpedro	 thats right, i just put it on the /usr/bin folder and it loads up fine but i want it where it belongs, Synaptic probabl installed it somewhere else so I might have my copy and synaptic, I just want to remove mine for good.
2006-06-03T12:40:00.000Z	rpedro	klormexor	if you used some installer it will probably have an uninstall function
2006-06-03T12:41:00.000Z	rpedro	klormexor	otherwise if you're sure it's just a folder with that one app, you can probably delete
2006-06-03T12:41:00.000Z	klormexor	rpedro	I dl the file from Realplay.com and ran it here and it ran ok
2006-06-03T12:42:00.000Z	klormexor	rpedro	 exactly, i think ill do that and run synaptic again, let me see what it does
2006-06-03T12:42:00.000Z	rpedro	klormexor	though I would first move the folder to another place, make sure you don't need it, and then delete
2006-06-03T12:42:00.000Z	klormexor	rpedro	yep. hey that /etc/local folder doesnt exist
2006-06-03T12:43:00.000Z	klormexor	rpedro	is thta the normal path to all exe's
2006-06-03T12:43:00.000Z	rpedro	klormexor	sorry, /usr/local
2006-06-03T12:43:00.000Z	klormexor	rpedro	there's a few folders in there but some are empty
2006-06-03T12:44:00.000Z	rpedro	klormexor	there is no central place for all the binaries in linux; some have them in /usr/bin, some other places, synaptic takes care of that
2006-06-03T12:44:00.000Z	klormexor	rpedro	gonna remove and reinstall realplayer
2006-06-03T12:45:00.000Z	klormexor	rpedro	aghhh, well i did this only cuz synaptic wasnt doing that for me, but oh well ill do it all over again
