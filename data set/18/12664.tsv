2006-04-13T16:18:00.000Z	disasm		one annoying thing i don't think is possible, but might as well ask anyway... when I hibernate and have ssh sessions open is their anyway to a) have them reconnect when it wakes up again or b) (slightly more realistic option) kill the ssh session so I don't have 50 terminals locked up that I can't close without kill (I have my terminals not showing window decorations)
2006-04-13T16:18:00.000Z	kingspawn	disasm	write a scritp
2006-04-13T16:18:00.000Z	kingspawn	disasm	make that "script"
2006-04-13T16:19:00.000Z	disasm	kingspawn	I guess I could killall ssh in the hibernate script
2006-04-13T16:19:00.000Z	kingspawn	disasm	indeed a clever plan! better than what i had in mind :)
2006-04-13T16:19:00.000Z	disasm	kingspawn	what did you have in mind?
2006-04-13T16:20:00.000Z	kingspawn	disasm	some kind of crazy python script that goes through your ssh-pids at bootup, kills and goes all crazy
2006-04-13T16:20:00.000Z	kingspawn	disasm	your plan is _that_ much better :)
2006-04-13T16:22:00.000Z	disasm	kingspawn	that did the trick, thanks for the idea :-D
2006-04-13T16:23:00.000Z	kingspawn	disasm	great!
2006-04-13T16:23:00.000Z	kingspawn	disasm	what's with the nick?
2006-04-13T16:25:00.000Z	disasm	kingspawn	i got the nick in high school when friends would show me a cool z80 assembly program they wrote for TI-86 calculators, and around lunch time I'd come back with their code disassembled :-D
2006-04-13T16:26:00.000Z	kingspawn	disasm	hahah, nice. i love disassembly, makes my day that much more fun
2006-04-13T16:28:00.000Z	disasm	kingspawn	writing a multi-cycle cpu in vhdl, and we were given a set of instructions in the program memory to run, rather than just figuring out what the code block did, i wrote a simple c++ program taking the hex inputs, converting to binary, and then disassembles the binary into assembly
2006-04-13T16:29:00.000Z	kingspawn	disasm	thats my kind of man! heh. i am just getting into the elf-format, have you read a quick tutorial named "teensy elf"? its real cool, some guy picks apart the elf-header so bad its not even funny
2006-04-13T16:30:00.000Z	disasm	kingspawn	i'll look into it
2006-04-13T16:30:00.000Z	kingspawn	disasm	www.ag0ny.net/~xpozed links to it
2006-04-13T16:31:00.000Z	kingspawn	disasm	sometimes im desperate for ... yeah, "your" kind of people in here
