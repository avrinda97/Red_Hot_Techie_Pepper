2009-12-10T10:56:00.000Z	bllz	Nperil	 you're doing it wrong.  apt-get (the package manager on ubuntu) automatically decides what needs to be updated and gets it from the repositories.  It will be INSANELY annoying/difficult for you to do this mannually.  If you're running ubuntu, you will need a working internet connection.
2009-12-10T10:59:00.000Z	Nperil	bllz	if i can get all the files and the info ive got all the time in the world
2009-12-10T10:59:00.000Z	bllz	Nperil	 to be honest, I wouldn't even know where to start
2009-12-10T10:59:00.000Z	bllz	Nperil	 you can't even get to a dial-up connection?
2009-12-10T11:00:00.000Z	Nperil	bllz	sure cant
2009-12-10T11:02:00.000Z	bllz	Nperil	 the problem is that ubuntu really is designed around having an internet connection for these things.  AFAIK this will involve devling into the aptitude database and such... i don't know the details
2009-12-10T11:02:00.000Z	bllz	Nperil	 but to be perfectly straight with you, It's probably a waste of time.  if you're not connecting to the internet, you probably don't need the security updates
2009-12-10T11:03:00.000Z	Nperil	bllz	alright, ill see what i can come up with
2009-12-10T11:04:00.000Z	bllz	Nperil	 I didn't know about aptoncd.  that might be something for you to look into
2009-12-10T11:06:00.000Z	Nperil	bllz	it might give me some ideas
2009-12-10T11:06:00.000Z	bllz	Nperil	 sounds like a solution to your problem
2009-12-10T11:07:00.000Z	Nperil	bllz	thanks. ttyl
