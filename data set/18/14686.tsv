2005-08-04T06:34:00.000Z	Mobius		anyone care to help me get my mini-itx working? fresh install for my parents
2005-08-04T06:35:00.000Z	holycow	Mobius	mini itx can be funky, they aren't exctly linux friendly
2005-08-04T06:35:00.000Z	holycow	Mobius	how far have you gotten?
2005-08-04T06:36:00.000Z	Mobius	holycow	right now I am getting about 50 FPS on glxgears
2005-08-04T06:36:00.000Z	holycow	Mobius	your not going to get much more than that
2005-08-04T06:38:00.000Z	Mobius	holycow	should I just not even bother then?
2005-08-04T06:38:00.000Z	holycow	Mobius	well do your parents need ogl really?
2005-08-04T06:38:00.000Z	holycow	Mobius	we might be able to fix that, depends.  what do you mean 'crap'?
2005-08-04T06:39:00.000Z	holycow	Mobius	you are probably using the vesa drivers
2005-08-04T06:43:00.000Z	Mobius	holycow	- reconfigured, now restart x?
2005-08-04T06:44:00.000Z	holycow	Mobius	ctrl / alt / backspace or justt logout and log back in
2005-08-04T06:45:00.000Z	holycow	Mobius	from command line: sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart
2005-08-04T06:48:00.000Z	Mobius	holycow	- looks much mch better, thanks! the first time I booted, HAL daemon didn't initialize, any thoughts?
2005-08-04T06:48:00.000Z	holycow	Mobius	reboot again, see if its there, sorry i know there are more sophisticated methods to debug that, i'm thinking its just a one time glitch
2005-08-04T06:49:00.000Z	Mobius	holycow	- hasn't happened but once this install, and it was the first boot, no problems since - i hope it is just not random so my parents don't wonder
2005-08-04T06:49:00.000Z	holycow	Mobius	its a random thing i would bet on that
2005-08-04T06:50:00.000Z	Mobius	holycow	- hope my parents don't mind =p
2005-08-04T06:50:00.000Z	holycow	Mobius	most peoples parents don't need ogl, you should be fine :) just make sure the ogl screen savers are disabled
