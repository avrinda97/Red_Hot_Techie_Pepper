2006-01-23T07:31:00.000Z	mephis1987		i have a problem
2006-01-23T07:32:00.000Z	cyphase	mephis1987	everybody had probles
2006-01-23T07:32:00.000Z	cyphase	mephis1987	instead of saying you have a problem, tell us the problem
2006-01-23T07:33:00.000Z	cyphase	mephis1987	do you have synaptic open?
2006-01-23T07:33:00.000Z	cyphase	mephis1987	are you installing via synaptic?
2006-01-23T07:33:00.000Z	cyphase	mephis1987	that's your problem
2006-01-23T07:34:00.000Z	cyphase	mephis1987	whenever you want to install a package, you usually use apt-get or Synaptic. each of them sets the file so that you don't have 2 programs installing things at once, which could lead to instability
2006-01-23T07:35:00.000Z	cyphase	mephis1987	so you can't use Synaptic and the terminal at once
2006-01-23T07:36:00.000Z	cyphase	mephis1987	on the whole computer, not just your account
2006-01-23T07:36:00.000Z	cyphase	mephis1987	you sure?
2006-01-23T07:36:00.000Z	cyphase	mephis1987	did you close synaptic properly? or did you kll it
2006-01-23T07:37:00.000Z	cyphase	mephis1987	make sure apt-get isn't running in any terminals
2006-01-23T07:39:00.000Z	cyphase	mephis1987	you have to run as root
2006-01-23T07:40:00.000Z	cyphase	mephis1987	run this..
2006-01-23T07:41:00.000Z	cyphase	mephis1987	sudo apt-get install chmlib
2006-01-23T07:43:00.000Z	cyphase	mephis1987	what's that?
2006-01-23T07:43:00.000Z	cyphase	mephis1987	1, yes you can. 2, couldn't you try? :)
