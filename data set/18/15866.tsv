2005-04-07T16:29:00.000Z	Seveas	jessica_	why the 386 kernel?
2005-04-07T16:30:00.000Z	jessica_	Seveas	Because it's the default. I know I can optimize to k7 or anything, but I can run gentoo as well. This is about a problem, which should be fixed. Not about the possibility to run other kernels.
2005-04-07T16:31:00.000Z	Seveas	jessica_	running another kernel can fix problems...
2005-04-07T16:31:00.000Z	jessica_	Seveas	No it bypassed them. Please, don't disturb this conversation. I can go run freebsd as well.
2005-04-07T16:33:00.000Z	Seveas	jessica_	fine, do what you want, i am just suggesting something, dont be a bitch about it
2005-04-07T16:33:00.000Z	jessica_	Seveas	I'm sorry, I will probably try another kernel as well. But I would just like to improve the things for other users as well.
2005-04-07T16:34:00.000Z	Seveas	jessica_	if everything is segfaulting than there are 3 things to do: run memtest86, upgrade kernel, upgrade libc
2005-04-07T16:35:00.000Z	jessica_	Seveas	I will run memtest86, good point
2005-04-07T10:03:00.000Z	Seveas	jessica_	you should only file bugreports when you pinpointed the problem, but it looks like a kernel hickup indeed
2005-04-07T10:04:00.000Z	jessica_	Seveas	Of course, I logged in to gnome... I'm afraid that's all :(
2005-04-07T10:05:00.000Z	Seveas	jessica_	does it also happen when booting into rescue mode?
2005-04-07T10:05:00.000Z	jessica_	Seveas	But i'd be glad to provide logs and tests to people who are knowledgable what to do with it
2005-04-07T10:05:00.000Z	jessica_	Seveas	I did not try. What kernel options should I use?
2005-04-07T10:05:00.000Z	Seveas	jessica_	there should be a "rescue mode" entry in the grub menu already
2005-04-07T10:06:00.000Z	jessica_	Seveas	I'm sorry, I don't have them. I have lilo, because grub wouldn't install, which is (I assume) an unrelated problem with the warty installer
2005-04-07T10:08:00.000Z	Seveas	jessica_	the standard ubuntu recovery mode uses "ro single" as options
2005-04-07T10:11:00.000Z	jessica_	Seveas	I will try the ro single mode. I think I will open a bugzilla entry anyhow, because it's on my girlfriends computer, and I can't be running tests here every minute of the day... So it might be a good thing to gather some test-suggestions and then run them all at once, to report the results. In any case, thanks for your input.
2005-04-07T10:12:00.000Z	jessica_	Seveas	Thanks, me too :)
