2007-01-07T09:01:00.000Z	jakob		how does ubuntu differentiate between files without file extensions?
2007-01-07T08:25:00.000Z	jakob		What is a SVN Snapshot?
2007-01-07T08:27:00.000Z	jakob		and what are these lines called "deb url main stable"?
2007-01-07T08:28:00.000Z	jakob		ice_wewe, as in I want find some to add to synaptic. What should google then?
2007-01-07T08:29:00.000Z	jakob		ice_wewe, not random, just for beryl
2007-01-07T08:29:00.000Z	mwe	jakob	the beryl wiki tells you how to it
2007-01-07T08:30:00.000Z	mwe	jakob	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BerylOnEdgy
2007-01-07T11:47:00.000Z	mwe	jakob	from what?
2007-01-07T11:47:00.000Z	jakob	mwe	a make or make install.
2007-01-07T11:48:00.000Z	mwe	jakob	it means the source code is broken
2007-01-07T11:48:00.000Z	mwe	jakob	what are you trying to install?
2007-01-07T11:48:00.000Z	jakob	mwe	would it be safer to find a new source, rather than fix it?
2007-01-07T11:49:00.000Z	jakob	mwe	xwinwrap, it's no longer on synaptics
2007-01-07T11:49:00.000Z	mwe	jakob	also consider using checkinstall instead of make install
2007-01-07T11:49:00.000Z	jakob	mwe	checkinstall --> command not found
2007-01-07T11:49:00.000Z	mwe	jakob	install it
2007-01-07T11:49:00.000Z	mwe	jakob	sudo aptitude install checkinstall
2007-01-07T11:50:00.000Z	jakob	mwe	thanks, I'll try that.
