2006-05-13T07:36:00.000Z	g0dchild		thats the link to the error messages
2006-05-13T07:37:00.000Z	ndazza	g0dchild	you need gtk libs installed. try sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev
2006-05-13T07:50:00.000Z	g0dchild	ndazza	installed, still giving off the same error.
2006-05-13T07:52:00.000Z	g0dchild	ndazza	could it be a problem with my paths? perhaps in need of editing by hand?
2006-05-13T07:54:00.000Z	ndazza	g0dchild	the script may depend on version 1 i guess - try also sudo apt-get install libgtk1.2-dev
2006-05-13T08:02:00.000Z	g0dchild	ndazza	now, i am getting an even more cryptic message about automake not supporting module_la_KDFLAGS. http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/13621
2006-05-13T08:08:00.000Z	g0dchild	ndazza	sorry to be a bother...but can you please lend a helping hand as to what this means? is there any other way i can isntall e-17?
2006-05-13T08:09:00.000Z	g0dchild	ndazza	here's the updated error messages: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/13621
2006-05-13T08:10:00.000Z	ndazza	g0dchild	1) what is it? 2) there are no errors in the pastebin you pasted. warnings aren't critical
2006-05-13T08:14:00.000Z	g0dchild	ndazza	ooookay- but these warnings seems to have led to the error...they were taken from /tmp/easy_e17/install_logs/evas.log- and it does say 'ERROR' next to evas...i know, its really getting to be a pain isnt it-
2006-05-13T08:15:00.000Z	ndazza	g0dchild	could you give me more details about the error line/s please?
2006-05-13T08:19:00.000Z	g0dchild	ndazza	her's the output of the entire evas log: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/13625
2006-05-13T08:24:00.000Z	ndazza	g0dchild	only 40 lines are appearing in the pastebin - there might be a limit on how much is pasted
2006-05-13T08:24:00.000Z	ndazza	g0dchild	would you mind pasting say the last 15 lines?
2006-05-13T08:26:00.000Z	g0dchild	ndazza	- ok, let me paste elsewhere...
2006-05-13T08:26:00.000Z	ndazza	g0dchild	feel free to /query me
