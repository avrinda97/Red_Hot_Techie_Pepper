2007-04-24T16:51:00.000Z	bluekeys		Hello.
2007-04-24T16:52:00.000Z	bluekeys		I have small problems with my sound while on Ubuntu.
2007-04-24T16:52:00.000Z	bluekeys		Sometimes when I boot up I have sound, sometimes I don't
2007-04-24T16:52:00.000Z	bluekeys		Anyone know what might cause this?
2007-04-24T16:53:00.000Z	bluekeys		Maybe should I just ask on the forums?
2007-04-24T16:54:00.000Z	bluekeys		Anyone know why sometimes I have sound, and sometimes I don't? The only way I can fix it is to reboot and sometimes I'll have sound. Speakers are connected to an Audigy card.

2007-04-24T11:44:00.000Z	bluekeys		!swiftbox
2007-04-24T11:44:00.000Z	bluekeys		Anyone know anything about swiftbox?
2007-04-24T11:44:00.000Z	tgm4883	bluekeys	is swiftbox like swiftfox?
2007-04-24T11:45:00.000Z	tgm4883	bluekeys	what do you want to know about it?
2007-04-24T11:45:00.000Z	bluekeys	tgm4883	is it worth getting? Is it that much better than regular firefox?
2007-04-24T11:46:00.000Z	tgm4883	bluekeys	eh, i suppose, it does seem to be quicker
2007-04-24T11:47:00.000Z	tgm4883	bluekeys	yes, but they may need kdelibs
2007-04-24T11:48:00.000Z	tgm4883	bluekeys	only if you have a samba server
2007-04-24T11:50:00.000Z	tgm4883	bluekeys	we could write more, but its pointless and we prefer to spend the time coding quality apps
2007-04-24T11:52:00.000Z	tgm4883	bluekeys	in a perfect world
