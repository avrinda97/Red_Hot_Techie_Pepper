2012-06-15T15:38:00.000Z	hapster		admak_: no option in the bios to turn off intel gpu.:(
2012-06-15T15:38:00.000Z	adamk_	hapster	So then it's an optimus laptop.
2012-06-15T15:38:00.000Z	hapster		admak_: I'm pretty sure it's not an optimus laptop. haha. I can use the nvidia-current driver.
2012-06-15T15:39:00.000Z	hapster		admak_: But I want to use nouveau
2012-06-15T15:46:00.000Z	adamk_	hapster	I'd love to see the Xorg log file from when you were using the nvidia driver.
2012-06-15T15:47:00.000Z	hapster	adamk_	Ok. hang on.
2012-06-15T15:50:00.000Z	hapster	adamk_	This is the dmesg file: http://pastebin.com/WctWPbdm And this is the Xorg log: http://pastebin.com/vZUBSfaV
2012-06-15T15:51:00.000Z	adamk_	hapster	That Xorg log file shows Xorg using the intel drive, not the nvidia driver.
2012-06-15T15:52:00.000Z	hapster	adamk_	That's my problem. I'm chatting in the nouveau channel as well. I want it to read the nvidia 610m.
2012-06-15T15:52:00.000Z	hapster	adamk_	According to them, my chips are relatively new so it doesn't support 3D acceleration yet.
2012-06-15T15:52:00.000Z	adamk_	hapster	Again, I believe this is a laptop with Optimus.  You said it wasn't because it worked fine with the nvidia driver without bumblebee.  But you have yet to show it working with the nvidia driver.
2012-06-15T15:54:00.000Z	hapster	adamk_	It's working with nvidia-current. Nouveau guys said nvd9 is not yet supported.
2012-06-15T15:55:00.000Z	adamk_	hapster	Alright so, again, pastebin the Xorg log file from when you are using the nvidia driver.
2012-06-15T15:55:00.000Z	hapster	adamk_	So I guess I'll have to wait if I want to use the nouveau driver.
2012-06-15T15:56:00.000Z	hapster	adamk_	But then I'll have to reload it and restart it. haha. Brb. Will get the logs.
2012-06-15T15:57:00.000Z	adamk_	hapster	This is mostly out of curiousity.  I've not heard of a modern laptop, with two GPUs, that is not Optimus and does not have an option in the BIOS to disable the onboard GPU.

2012-06-15T15:58:00.000Z	hapster	adamk_	That's my laptop's model
