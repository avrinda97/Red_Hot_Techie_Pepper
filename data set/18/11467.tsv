2010-07-06T00:50:00.000Z	vitaly		?
2010-07-06T00:51:00.000Z	sebsebseb	vitaly	yes hello
2010-07-06T00:51:00.000Z	sebsebseb	vitaly	hi
2010-07-06T00:52:00.000Z	sebsebseb	vitaly	yes, but
2010-07-06T00:52:00.000Z	sebsebseb	vitaly	not really meant to install it into the server edition, and can run servers on the desktop version anyway
2010-07-06T00:54:00.000Z	vitaly	sebsebseb	I keep getting "E: Couldn't find package ubuntu-desktop"
2010-07-06T00:54:00.000Z	sebsebseb	vitaly	uhmm
2010-07-06T00:55:00.000Z	sebsebseb	vitaly	Why are you using the server edition?
2010-07-06T00:56:00.000Z	sebsebseb	vitaly	big boys heh?  actsually business is more likely to be using , Debian, CentOS,  or Redhat Enterprise Linux, when it comes to servers.
2010-07-06T00:57:00.000Z	sebsebseb	vitaly	uh not you
2010-07-06T00:57:00.000Z	sebsebseb	vitaly	What type of servers do you want to run?
2010-07-06T00:58:00.000Z	sebsebseb	vitaly	ok and this is just for your own personal use?
2010-07-06T00:58:00.000Z	sebsebseb	vitaly	I mean upgrading to a later version of Ubuntu when there is a reason to, no problem and such?
2010-07-06T00:58:00.000Z	sebsebseb	vitaly	what I think you should do is install  Xubuntu since you said you wanted XFCE, and then run your servers in that
2010-07-06T00:59:00.000Z	vitaly	sebsebseb	is there a list of features to compare of ubuntu server vs ubuntu desktop
2010-07-06T00:59:00.000Z	sebsebseb	vitaly	now if your going to do a proper server for business,  then sure server edition,  or Debian or CentOS,  or Redhat Enterprise LInux or something
2010-07-06T00:59:00.000Z	sebsebseb	vitaly	for home use though,  doing servers is rather fine indeed in the desktop version
