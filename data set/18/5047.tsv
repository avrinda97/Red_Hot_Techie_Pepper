2009-02-19T07:04:00.000Z	ScottG489		How do I disable the login sound on ubuntu?
2009-02-19T07:04:00.000Z	hlm	ScottG489	go to system >prefences sounds
2009-02-19T07:05:00.000Z	hlm	ScottG489	when in system>preferences>sound in the sounds tab there is a dialog that says login
2009-02-19T07:06:00.000Z	ScottG489	hlm	Yea ive been here before, it shows WHAT sounds but I dont see how to disable it..........nvm figured it out
2009-02-19T07:06:00.000Z	hlm	ScottG489	in alerts and sound effects you will find login, it should say default next to it, click it and then a popup will appear on it select disable, and close it and you will no longer play sounds on login
2009-02-19T07:06:00.000Z	ScottG489	hlm	It was hiding, i had to click on the disable
2009-02-19T07:07:00.000Z	hlm	ScottG489	that is correct :-)
2009-02-19T07:07:00.000Z	ScottG489	hlm	Thanks :) Want to help me get my hibernate working too? Its been my biggest problem
2009-02-19T07:08:00.000Z	hlm	ScottG489	I have absolutely no clue on how to do that, sorry :-(
2009-02-19T07:08:00.000Z	ScottG489	hlm	lol ok well thanks anyways
2009-02-19T07:08:00.000Z	hlm	ScottG489	Glad I could help! :-)
2009-02-19T07:09:00.000Z	ScottG489	hlm	Why is it that I never hear the logout sound. Does turning off your computer not count?
2009-02-19T07:09:00.000Z	hlm	ScottG489	evidently I think thats true, because I never hear it either
2009-02-19T07:14:00.000Z	ScottG489	hlm	I also lost that animation where the screen gets all bright when i was logging in or turning off my computer
2009-02-19T07:14:00.000Z	ScottG489	hlm	I think its because i installed compiz
2009-02-19T07:15:00.000Z	hlm	ScottG489	thats no explanation, what color did it used to be? orange correct?
2009-02-19T07:16:00.000Z	ScottG489	hlm	I thought it was just white. But I think compiz has its own login and logout effect so thats my guess. The screen would slowly get all whited out, and sometimes it would then go inverse and turned black/purpleish
2009-02-19T07:17:00.000Z	hlm	ScottG489	I dont have a clue about that, sorry :-(
