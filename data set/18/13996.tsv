2009-06-19T09:54:00.000Z	elad`	kain	it could be beryl.
2009-06-19T09:54:00.000Z	elad`	kain	have you got effects enabled in Appearance?
2009-06-19T09:55:00.000Z	kain	elad`	i have "normal" effects
2009-06-19T09:55:00.000Z	elad`	kain	try turning them off and on?
2009-06-19T09:56:00.000Z	kain	elad`	go in keyboard shortcut and add a shortcut
2009-06-19T09:59:00.000Z	kain	elad`	i tried what u suggested for the alt-shift-tab in appearance, but nothing happened
2009-06-19T10:00:00.000Z	kain	elad`	i still have the problem
2009-06-19T10:00:00.000Z	elad`	kain	when you've turned off the effects, but haven't turned them back on yet, does alt-tab work?
2009-06-19T10:01:00.000Z	kain	elad`	its the alt-shift-tab that don't work
2009-06-19T10:03:00.000Z	kain	elad`	is it possible that my nvidia driver is screwing it up?
2009-06-19T10:03:00.000Z	elad`	kain	I wouldn't know, but I highly doubt it.
2009-06-19T10:04:00.000Z	kain	elad`	damn :S, it was working a few days ago, may while i was trying to work my webcam, i change something but i wouldn't know what
2009-06-19T10:05:00.000Z	kain	elad`	 ooohhhhh wait hold on, i think i found the problem
2009-06-19T10:08:00.000Z	kain	elad`	i found why i had the problem, in my keyboard setup, i had put "alt-shift" to switch between languages and thats what was causing my problem, thanks for helping me think clearly :P
2009-06-19T10:10:00.000Z	elad`	kain	my god, I am such an idiot! I had just the same problem in the past, but I had completely forgotten about it!
