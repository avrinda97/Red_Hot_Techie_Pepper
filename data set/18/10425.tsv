2008-02-19T20:11:00.000Z	soweto76		motherboard claims "SATA II"-- lspci shows " IDE interface: nVidia Corporation MCP61 SATA Controller" is this real SATA device or some kind of bridge?
2008-02-19T20:11:00.000Z	erUSUL	soweto76	real

2008-02-19T20:12:00.000Z	soweto76	erUSUL	I was expecting some reference to AHCI but his seems to be connected via IDE
2008-02-19T20:13:00.000Z	erUSUL	soweto76	you should be able to configure that on the mb BIOS
2008-02-19T20:13:00.000Z	soweto76	erUSUL	OK, thanks, I will take a look.
2008-02-19T20:13:00.000Z	erUSUL	soweto76	ahci mode for the ide chip i mean
2008-02-19T20:14:00.000Z	erUSUL	soweto76	mine has three modes ahci; raid (fakeraid) and legacy or something like that ahci is prefered for linux
2008-02-19T20:14:00.000Z	soweto76	erUSUL	how does the ide and sata work together -- I thought they were separate.
2008-02-19T20:15:00.000Z	erUSUL	soweto76	they are separate
2008-02-19T20:15:00.000Z	soweto76	erUSUL	this lspci output only show SATA on the "IDE interface"
2008-02-19T20:16:00.000Z	erUSUL	soweto76	well SATA is an evolution of IDE
2008-02-19T20:16:00.000Z	soweto76	erUSUL	Thanks again.  I will fiddle with the BIOS as you suggested.
2008-02-19T20:16:00.000Z	erUSUL	soweto76	they are two forms of ide old PATA (parallel ATA) and new SATA (serial ATA)
2008-02-19T20:17:00.000Z	soweto76	erUSUL	OK
2008-02-19T20:18:00.000Z	soweto76	erUSUL	I assume that the two SATA connectors are independent and not two drives one channel like the old ide -- that correct?
2008-02-19T20:18:00.000Z	erUSUL	soweto76	yes
2008-02-19T20:19:00.000Z	soweto76	erUSUL	10Q l8r B-)
