2007-10-22T15:27:00.000Z	zetheroo		does gobuntu have a GUI?
2007-10-22T15:28:00.000Z	zetheroo		what does Ubuntu have that Gobuntu does not have?
2007-10-22T15:28:00.000Z	stefg	zetheroo	proprietary Drivers and codecs
2007-10-22T15:29:00.000Z	zetheroo	stefg	is it a worse performer than Ubuntu?
2007-10-22T15:30:00.000Z	stefg	zetheroo	it's not about performance (it's basically the same distro) but about free software in an orthodox view. But to get e.g. 3D working on Ati/Nvidia you have no choice as to use proprietary drivers atm
2007-10-22T15:31:00.000Z	zetheroo	stefg	so Compiz-fuzion would not work....
2007-10-22T15:32:00.000Z	stefg	zetheroo	right, unless you don't have Intel graphics for which a free driver is available
2007-10-22T15:32:00.000Z	zetheroo	stefg	I see..
2007-10-22T15:33:00.000Z	stefg	zetheroo	cwillu : ever heard of GPL ? That wouldn't be so easy. But this talk is better suited in #ubuntu-offtopic
2007-10-22T15:34:00.000Z	zetheroo	stefg	I dunno... is it really "off-topic"?!?
2007-10-22T15:34:00.000Z	stefg	zetheroo	that's not support related, thus it's offtopic
2007-10-22T15:35:00.000Z	zetheroo	stefg	I suppose.... but it is a real question that I get from people I help get onto Ubuntu...
2007-10-22T15:36:00.000Z	stefg	zetheroo	it's written in gig friendly letters on the ubuntu homepage: it will always be free of charge. The model is making money from paid support and customizations
2007-10-22T15:36:00.000Z	zetheroo	stefg	so I can buy support?
2007-10-22T15:37:00.000Z	stefg	zetheroo	so yes
2007-10-22T15:38:00.000Z	zetheroo	stefg	how does it really help me if there is no Ubuntu office in Australia?....
2007-10-22T15:38:00.000Z	stefg	zetheroo	support is done by phone, mail and other means... we have the interweb, you know :-)
2007-10-22T15:39:00.000Z	zetheroo	stefg	cool.... its just really expensive.. ha
