2007-08-17T08:25:00.000Z	shiester_miester	wastrel	desktop effects is not what he is talking about
2007-08-17T08:27:00.000Z	wastrel	shiester_miester	 how are you connecting to the net with your ubunto
2007-08-17T08:28:00.000Z	shiester_miester	wastrel	cat5 cable plugged into my adsl modem/router box
2007-08-17T08:28:00.000Z	wastrel	shiester_miester	 you don't need pppoe or something?
2007-08-17T08:28:00.000Z	shiester_miester	wastrel	thats for usb connections or something isnt it?
2007-08-17T08:29:00.000Z	shiester_miester	wastrel	in any case, it was working fine for quite a while and then it just degraded quickly and now it won't work at all
2007-08-17T08:30:00.000Z	shiester_miester	wastrel	for the past week or so its been connecting rather unpredictably, sometimes when I boot ubuntu it will connect, other times not.  but if i restarted a few times, it usually worked.  now it doesn't work, ever
2007-08-17T08:30:00.000Z	wastrel	shiester_miester	 restarting dhclient and whatnot no help?
2007-08-17T08:31:00.000Z	shiester_miester	wastrel	dhclient?  i haven't used that, although i did do quite a bit of "sudo /etc/init.d/networking stop/start/restart" and "ifconfig eth0/1 up/down"
2007-08-17T08:32:00.000Z	wastrel	shiester_miester	 don't do ifconfig up/down  use  ifup and ifdown  they will run the dhcp client for you
2007-08-17T08:33:00.000Z	shiester_miester	wastrel	also, whenever I try to ping anything (except the looback addr), i get "sendmsg: operation not permitted" or "send_packet: operation not permitted"
2007-08-17T08:34:00.000Z	shiester_miester	wastrel	any other ideas?
2007-08-17T08:35:00.000Z	wastrel	shiester_miester	 send_packet: operation not permitted  seems to be a dhcp problem
2007-08-17T08:35:00.000Z	shiester_miester	wastrel	thats what I thought, although when I do the networking restart command, it sends a DHCPREQUEST and gets a reply from the modem
2007-08-17T08:36:00.000Z	shiester_miester	wastrel	but for some reason it doesn't end up with an IP
2007-08-17T08:37:00.000Z	wastrel	shiester_miester	 i'm getting out of my depth, if your dhclient is running with the /etc/init.d/networking restart (which i haven't used looked at before) then ifup/ifdown probably won't help...
2007-08-17T08:37:00.000Z	shiester_miester	wastrel	but I'm not sure if its running or not...if its sending dhcp pacets and receiving some too, does that mean its working?
2007-08-17T08:41:00.000Z	wastrel	shiester_miester	 route
