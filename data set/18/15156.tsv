2005-04-28T13:32:00.000Z	MFKR		This is quite infuriating >.<
2005-04-28T13:33:00.000Z	MFKR		I left my computer open for 20 minutes, hoping the freeze on the initialization would go away, and it didn't.
2005-04-28T13:33:00.000Z	liable	MFKR	look through the boot parameers to see if there is a 'no usb' option
2005-04-28T13:50:00.000Z	liable	MFKR	I dont know how many kernel options there are on the cd, but have you tried a diff kernel
2005-04-28T14:05:00.000Z	liable	MFKR	is there an expert mode for the install?
2005-04-28T14:06:00.000Z	MFKR	liable	yes.
2005-04-28T14:06:00.000Z	liable	MFKR	maybe try that, I think you can skip hardware detection with it
2005-04-28T14:08:00.000Z	liable	MFKR	hmm, dunno
2005-04-28T14:10:00.000Z	liable	MFKR	sounds maybe a hardware prob
2005-04-28T14:11:00.000Z	MFKR	liable	well, it seems like it's trying to detect a USB storage device that sadly does not exist.
2005-04-28T14:14:00.000Z	liable	MFKR	what happens when you plug something into that port
2005-04-28T14:35:00.000Z	liable	MFKR	what does windows have to do with it
2005-04-28T14:36:00.000Z	MFKR	liable	Windows Xp seems to create hardware errors when you simply yank out an USB device it seems.
2005-04-28T14:37:00.000Z	liable	MFKR	yep, but that shouldnt be applicable to ubuntu install cd, maybe the plug is faulty
2005-04-28T14:37:00.000Z	liable	MFKR	try unpluging the plug
2005-04-28T14:38:00.000Z	liable	MFKR	if you know what I mean :)
2005-04-28T14:38:00.000Z	liable	MFKR	well, dont winge when it doesnt work :)
2005-04-28T15:45:00.000Z	liable	MFKR	thought you were going to bed :)
