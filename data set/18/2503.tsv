2010-05-01T21:25:00.000Z	RBecker		Hey guys, having a problem with Lucid.  I have a USB display adapter and an onboard NVIDIA card.  Ubuntu picked up and installed restricted drivers for my NVIDIA card, but it's not detecting my USB adapter.  It just shows a green screen.  Any ideas?
2010-05-01T21:26:00.000Z	RBecker		sudo visudo from terminal
2010-05-01T21:27:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	RBecker	what is the make/model of your USB display adapter?  Perhaps lsusb will tell you if you're not sure, or check the output of dmesg.

2010-05-01T21:29:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	RBecker	sorry couldn't find anything good on google - forum post not working in 9.10 (no followups) http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1304909
2010-05-01T21:30:00.000Z	RBecker	ZykoticK9	if I get output from dmesg would it help
2010-05-01T21:31:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	RBecker	probably not i'm affraid - doesn't seem like your usb-thing is very popular on linux.  Hope you find a solution.
2010-05-01T21:36:00.000Z	RBecker	ZykoticK9	I just turned my monitor on, it said it was running at 1280x1024, 64Khz refresh rate, but it supports neither of those.  Could we be getting somewhere?
2010-05-01T21:37:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	RBecker	sorry man - i don't have one of those devices (never used one), and i don't find anything online to assist.  I'm no help, sorry.
2010-05-01T21:37:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	RBecker	not that i'm aware of
