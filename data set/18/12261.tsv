2007-09-25T15:29:00.000Z	ikonia	DarKnesS_WolF	what part is not clear to you ?
2007-09-25T15:29:00.000Z	ikonia	DarKnesS_WolF	the alt-cd asks you basic questions in english
2007-11-29T18:53:00.000Z	ikonia	DarKnesS_WolF	/etc/init.d is the boot scripts core directory
2007-11-29T18:57:00.000Z	ikonia	DarKnesS_WolF	have you tested the script first
2007-11-29T18:58:00.000Z	DarKnesS_WolF	ikonia	yes it works from teh shell
2007-11-29T18:58:00.000Z	ikonia	DarKnesS_WolF	check you set the path in your script
2007-11-29T18:58:00.000Z	DarKnesS_WolF	ikonia	it is correct i did copy what i wrote on rc.local to the terminal and it did work
2007-11-29T18:59:00.000Z	ikonia	DarKnesS_WolF	thats not what I said, your shell environment may be different than the execution shell
2007-11-29T18:59:00.000Z	DarKnesS_WolF	ikonia	what u mean ? i put the full script bath
2007-11-29T18:59:00.000Z	ikonia	DarKnesS_WolF	your user shell path maynot be the same as the default path userd
2007-11-29T19:00:00.000Z	DarKnesS_WolF	ikonia	i know it is not in the path but i put the full path of the script /var/www/goeserver/bin/startup.sh
2007-11-29T19:02:00.000Z	DarKnesS_WolF	ikonia	so ?
2007-11-29T19:02:00.000Z	ikonia	DarKnesS_WolF	I missed your last message, sorry
2007-11-29T19:08:00.000Z	DarKnesS_WolF	ikonia	i added /var/www/geoserver/bin/startup.sh into rc.local and it is still not loading :-s
2007-11-29T19:08:00.000Z	ikonia	DarKnesS_WolF	do you have any non-absoloute paths ?
2007-11-29T19:10:00.000Z	ikonia	DarKnesS_WolF	you need a shell script to launch it, yes
2007-11-29T19:15:00.000Z	DarKnesS_WolF	ikonia	? look i have /var/www/geoserver/bin/startup.sh i want it to be running when i start my machine .. and i added it into rc.local and it didn't work .. any idea why ? where to debug or how !?
