2005-12-22T12:06:00.000Z	Amaranth	Oblivion^	I believe Applications->System Tools->Configuration Editor then /apps/totem is what you want
2005-12-22T12:07:00.000Z	Amaranth	Oblivion^	You told gstreamer to use alsa and you're using totem-gstreamer?
2005-12-22T12:08:00.000Z	Oblivion^	Amaranth	no, i'm using all kinds of audio players, and no one works
2005-12-22T12:09:00.000Z	Amaranth	Oblivion^	Open a terminal, type `sudo sh -c 'cat /usr/bin/* > /dev/dsp'
2005-12-22T12:10:00.000Z	Oblivion^	Amaranth	i'm hearing nothing
2005-12-22T12:10:00.000Z	Amaranth	Oblivion^	Did you get any error?
2005-12-22T12:11:00.000Z	Oblivion^	Amaranth	except for the '/usr/bin/X11: Is a directory, no
2005-12-22T12:11:00.000Z	Amaranth	Oblivion^	Then your sound works, it's just muted.
2005-12-22T12:11:00.000Z	Oblivion^	Amaranth	i've checked and it is not muted. or i missed something
2005-12-22T12:13:00.000Z	Oblivion^	Amaranth	when i try playing an mp3 in mpd it starts playing for about 1 second and then it stops again, and you hear nothing. that's why i think sound isn't muted
2005-12-22T12:13:00.000Z	Amaranth	Oblivion^	Hrm, I dunno then. Sorry.
2005-12-22T12:13:00.000Z	Oblivion^	Amaranth	ok
2005-12-22T12:21:00.000Z	Amaranth	Oblivion^	I don't think Ubuntu really has different (X vs non-X) runlevels
2005-12-22T12:21:00.000Z	Oblivion^	Amaranth	so when i've installed X i can't boot without X anymore?
2005-12-22T12:22:00.000Z	Oblivion^	Amaranth	i wanted to use init 3 as a default runlevel
2005-12-22T12:22:00.000Z	Amaranth	Oblivion^	I don't believe so, unless you customize the run levels.
2005-12-22T12:22:00.000Z	Amaranth	Oblivion^	There is a GUI tool for that, I believe it's called BUM
2005-12-22T12:22:00.000Z	Oblivion^	Amaranth	ok, i'll try that
