2007-11-16T18:29:00.000Z	k3ito	nmditka	it says UNCLAIMED though. is that right?!
2007-11-16T18:31:00.000Z	nmditka		K3ito i'm not the best at linux hardware.  i didnt want your problem to go ignored though
2007-11-16T18:31:00.000Z	nmditka		i do often find that restarting helps but im a noob
2007-11-16T18:31:00.000Z	k3ito		no worries ;)  I'm just stumped.  it was working fine a second ago
2007-11-16T18:32:00.000Z	nmditka		i think its some conflict.  are you running kde on that system
2007-11-16T18:34:00.000Z	nmditka		K3ito:  so you do have KDE on that system.  are you running in it right now?  I ask because when I had KDE on my system a whole lot of stuff would clash and not work.  Gnome properties would hang, audio would stop running in KDE.  i ended up just picking Gnome and everything works fine.
2007-11-16T18:35:00.000Z	nmditka		oh wow..  i mixed up usernames really badly
2007-11-16T18:36:00.000Z	k3ito	nmditka	yes, but it has worked fine before
2007-11-16T18:37:00.000Z	nmditka		K3ito: a software conflict is the only idea i have.  but i don't know much.
2007-11-16T18:39:00.000Z	k3ito	nmditka	i tried updating some software and it hung then i hard reset adnd noticed it.  don't know 100%that was the cause but it's possible
2007-11-16T18:39:00.000Z	nmditka		do you know what file it hung on?
2007-11-16T18:39:00.000Z	k3ito		!xorg
2007-11-16T18:40:00.000Z	nmditka		K3ito: well i would think that would mess more with your graphics than your sound, but it might have something to do with it
2007-11-16T18:41:00.000Z	nmditka		did you finish the update?
2007-11-16T18:51:00.000Z	k3ito		aplay -l
2007-11-16T18:51:00.000Z	k3ito		aplay: device_list:222: no soundcards found...
2007-11-16T18:51:00.000Z	k3ito	nmditka	^^
