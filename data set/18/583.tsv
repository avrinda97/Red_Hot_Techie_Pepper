2012-03-02T11:46:00.000Z	harsh343	Canadian1296	yes
2012-03-02T11:47:00.000Z	harsh343	Canadian1296	but i want o use both  something.yourdomain.com and yourdomain.com
2012-03-02T11:48:00.000Z	Canadian1296	harsh343	You need to find set up your dns server to point both to your ip address. Then set up virtualhosts in apache. Just ask if you need help with any of that :)
2012-03-02T11:49:00.000Z	harsh343	Canadian1296	ok i am trying to do that,thanks
2012-03-02T11:49:00.000Z	Canadian1296	harsh343	Do you have your own server at home?
2012-03-02T11:50:00.000Z	harsh343	Canadian1296	I purchase domain from joker.com
2012-03-02T11:51:00.000Z	Canadian1296	harsh343	Ill take that as a no. You need a domain name (you already got this), and a hosting plan (you need this). The hosting plan lets you upload your site so people can go to it.
2012-03-02T11:52:00.000Z	harsh343	Canadian1296	i have both
2012-03-02T11:54:00.000Z	Canadian1296	harsh343	Okay, what domain did you buy?
2012-03-02T11:54:00.000Z	harsh343	Canadian1296	its private but for xample www.harshutech.com
2012-03-02T11:55:00.000Z	harsh343	Canadian1296	I know that we need domain+hosting both and i have both
2012-03-02T11:58:00.000Z	Canadian1296	harsh343	Then PM me the name so I can look. What is the registrar and host?
2012-03-02T11:58:00.000Z	harsh343	Canadian1296	ok see this is my website http://www.appsmyth.com/ and i want to access like this http://sk.appsmyth.com/
2012-03-02T12:04:00.000Z	Canadian1296	harsh343	sacarlson: chances are you transferred to domain to the host, so go your hosts admin page and look for "subdomains"
2012-03-02T12:06:00.000Z	harsh343	Canadian1296	sacarlson t #appache2 to see how to setup more virtual servers or "subdomains" ????????????
