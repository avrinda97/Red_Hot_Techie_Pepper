2008-11-28T23:37:00.000Z	imc_		Just installed 8.10 on MacBook Pro and it can't boot - it's alone, not using bootcamp - did I miss a step?
2008-11-28T23:38:00.000Z	imc_		anyone with ubuntu/MacBook experience?
2008-11-28T23:40:00.000Z	rww	imc_	What happens when you try? Do you get a black folder icon on a grey/white background with a ? in it?
2008-11-28T23:39:00.000Z	rww	imc_	I have a little. What's your problem?
2008-11-28T23:39:00.000Z	imc_	rww	hey, I just wiped OSX and installed 8.10 but I cannot boot into Ubuntu
2008-11-28T23:41:00.000Z	rww	imc_	hold down the Option key when the screen first turns on. You should get to a screen with a picture of a hard drive on it with an inaccurate caption (probably "Windows"). Press enter and see if you can boot okay.
2008-11-28T23:42:00.000Z	imc_	rww	bummer, I do that and I gert a blank screen with a mouse pointer but no possibility to boot into...anything
2008-11-28T23:44:00.000Z	rww	imc_	hmm, that's odd. https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MacBook#Basic%20instructions says: "(If the boot menu does not "see" your freshly installed Ubuntu; burn rEFIt on a CD, boot from it and resync the MBR with GPT due to “Partitioning Tool”.) " and links to http://refit.sourceforge.net/doc/c1s5_burning.html . You could try that.
2008-11-28T23:44:00.000Z	imc_	rww	thanks Much, will try that now
2008-11-28T23:45:00.000Z	rww	imc_	You might also read through that help.ubuntu.com link and consider redoing the installation their way. Depends on how much time you have to spend ;-)
2008-11-29T02:28:00.000Z	rww	imc_	that's rww, and yes, I just got back from lunch :)
2008-11-29T02:29:00.000Z	rww	imc_	No problem :). I guess by the fact you came back that you're still having issues?
2008-11-29T02:29:00.000Z	imc_	rww	so I followed thiose instructions, reinstalled with grub on sda, but still I cannot boot unless...this is weird...unless I boot into the CD and then select boot from disk
2008-11-29T02:32:00.000Z	rww	imc_	hmm. It looks like the problem is that the rEFIt partition probably isn't blessed properly... problem is that you need an OS X installation to do that properly. Honestly, at this point I'd probably install OS X, then follow the instructions in https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MacBook#Basic%20instructions
2008-11-29T02:33:00.000Z	rww	imc_	Yeah, I know, it's not a great answer... you could try posting in the forums (ubuntuforums.org) and see if anyone else can figure out a way to fix it.
2008-11-29T02:33:00.000Z	rww	imc_	There should be, but that didn't work when we tried it.
2008-11-29T02:34:00.000Z	rww	imc_	You're welcome! Sorry I couldn't be more helpful...
2008-11-29T02:34:00.000Z	rww	imc_	:)
