2010-05-01T12:18:00.000Z	Minger		my /home dir = 2.8 GB and my user dir /home/xman is ~ 2.8 GB. i'm running out of space. how do i increase this limit?  i don't see any quotas in place.
2010-05-01T12:20:00.000Z	maco	Minger	is /home on a separate partition from the rest? youd have to resize the partitions if so
2010-05-01T12:21:00.000Z	maco	Minger	so you're just seeing teh size of the folders being the same and thinking you're out of space?
2010-05-01T12:22:00.000Z	maco	Minger	are you sure its not just telling you how much is *currently* in there?
2010-05-01T12:22:00.000Z	Minger	maco	2 things, i get warnings about being out of space when i try to create files under /home/xman and disk usage analyzer says /home/xman is ~ the total capacity of /home (red in color)
2010-05-01T12:22:00.000Z	maco	Minger	disk usage analyzer colours dont mean anything afaik
2010-05-01T12:23:00.000Z	maco	Minger	can you pastebin the output of "df -h"?
2010-05-01T12:23:00.000Z	Minger	maco	df -h = http://pastebin.com/LJwZprWy
2010-05-01T12:25:00.000Z	maco	Minger	youve got 4 and a bit GB free on your disk (but wow, only a 16GB disk??)
2010-05-01T12:26:00.000Z	maco	Minger	if you want to clear up some space, you can run "sudo apt-get clean" to get rid of old installer files
2010-05-01T12:26:00.000Z	Minger	maco	this is ubuntu on vmware.  the one user dir is almost 100% of the home dir.  can't i increase it?
2010-05-01T12:27:00.000Z	maco	Minger	the home dir doesnt have a set size
2010-05-01T12:27:00.000Z	maco	Minger	it grows as its contents growns
2010-05-01T12:28:00.000Z	Minger	maco	ok... however i keep seeing warnings when i create files that my storage is maxed out (no more space)
2010-05-01T12:28:00.000Z	maco	Minger	thats because the virtual hard disk is nearly full
2010-05-01T12:29:00.000Z	Minger	maco	the pastebin i show says i have 4.3G available under / or 29% left?
2010-05-01T12:29:00.000Z	maco	Minger	possibly a large file that hasnt been flushed to disk yet?
2010-05-01T12:30:00.000Z	Minger	maco	raj: ok
