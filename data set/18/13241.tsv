2005-12-20T08:33:00.000Z	nickrude	ngmlinux_	it's the pipe into patch; try | sudo tee patch, etch
2005-12-20T08:46:00.000Z	ngmlinux_	nickrude	ahh let me try that
2005-12-20T08:49:00.000Z	nickrude	ngmlinux_	to be honest, I'm not real clear on the theory behind that. I got it from this channel a while ago for piping into files that need sudo privileges
2005-12-20T08:49:00.000Z	nickrude	ngmlinux_	it worked, so I use it :)
2005-12-20T08:49:00.000Z	ngmlinux_	nickrude	I'm not terrible concerned with how it works, I'm just unsure of exactly what to type
2005-12-20T08:50:00.000Z	nickrude	ngmlinux_	what was the line again?
2005-12-20T08:51:00.000Z	ngmlinux_	nickrude	http://pastebin.com/464712
2005-12-20T08:53:00.000Z	nickrude	ngmlinux_	I think http://pastebin.com/464713 would work
2005-12-20T09:06:00.000Z	nickrude	ngmlinux_	possibilities are endless, a sec
2005-12-20T09:10:00.000Z	nickrude	ngmlinux_	a simple solution, because I'm not really free to think at the moment: sudo -i, then run the line , then exit
2005-12-20T09:11:00.000Z	nickrude	ngmlinux_	zcat ../diff-2.6.12.2-armcore | patch -p1
2005-12-20T09:12:00.000Z	nickrude	ngmlinux_	the sudo -i will give you a root terminal temporarily. Useful for not thinking about sudo in complicated commands :)
2005-12-20T09:12:00.000Z	nickrude	ngmlinux_	I should have mentioned it a half hour ago, sorry :)
2005-12-20T09:12:00.000Z	nickrude	ngmlinux_	no, it's a 'feature' of sudo :)
2005-12-20T09:13:00.000Z	ngmlinux_	nickrude	oh how I love time saving (or wasting) features lol
2005-12-20T09:14:00.000Z	nickrude	ngmlinux_	sudo is useful for remembering to be cautious; I disable the password part
2005-12-20T09:27:00.000Z	ngmlinux_	nickrude	you still there?
2005-12-20T09:28:00.000Z	ngmlinux_	nickrude	I have one more question if you have a sec
