2007-05-09T10:37:00.000Z	soniczny		How to configure lan ,i'd like to use computer with ubuntu as router and to share internet connection
2007-05-09T10:37:00.000Z	ikonia	soniczny	you want to use iptables, or a proxy program like "squid"
2007-05-09T10:38:00.000Z	soniczny	ikonia	i really dunno im newbie ,whats better?
2007-05-09T10:38:00.000Z	ikonia	soniczny	do you wantto browse the web, or do "everything"
2007-05-09T10:38:00.000Z	soniczny	ikonia	 rather everything
2007-05-09T10:38:00.000Z	ikonia	soniczny	iptables probably best then
2007-05-09T10:39:00.000Z	ikonia	soniczny	not really, as its quite long winded, there is a guide on the wiki though
2007-05-09T10:39:00.000Z	soniczny	ikonia	ok ill look for it ,thanks
2007-05-09T10:39:00.000Z	ikonia	soniczny	if you have specific questions, please ask, happy to answer
2007-05-09T10:40:00.000Z	soniczny	ikonia	this iptables will make my lan works ? because all computers in lan dont see each other
2007-05-09T10:41:00.000Z	ikonia	soniczny	it won't make you lan work - but it will allow routing
2007-05-09T10:41:00.000Z	soniczny	ikonia	 so what should i do at 1st, make lan works or make routing ?
2007-05-09T10:41:00.000Z	ikonia	soniczny	get your lan sorted
2007-05-09T10:42:00.000Z	soniczny	ikonia	 dhcpd server is enough to make lan work ?
2007-05-09T10:43:00.000Z	ikonia	soniczny	no, you need a proper networking setup. Dhcp is just an ip address allocator
2007-05-09T10:44:00.000Z	soniczny	ikonia	umm so what should i do, what soft i should install
2007-05-09T10:45:00.000Z	ikonia	soniczny	do you understand networking
2007-05-09T11:24:00.000Z	soniczny	ikonia	 im workin on dhcp and got that
