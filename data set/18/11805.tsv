2007-04-21T05:42:00.000Z	jrib	brandon^	what do you want to use it for?
2007-04-21T05:43:00.000Z	jrib	brandon^	I would recommend the latest, feisty fawn 7.04
2007-04-21T05:44:00.000Z	jrib	brandon^	yes, you will have headaches gettings multimedia stuff like flash and java plugin to work
2007-04-21T05:45:00.000Z	jrib	brandon^	if you use your computer to view alot of media and you are relatively new, 32bit is better.  64bit isn't worth it in that case
2007-04-22T06:11:00.000Z	jrib	brandon^	try the alternate cd (and file a bug if one doesn't exist)
2007-04-22T06:15:00.000Z	jrib	brandon^	no, seperate download
2007-04-22T06:15:00.000Z	jrib	brandon^	you tried the "safe mode" (can't remember the exact language) on the live cd?
2007-04-22T06:16:00.000Z	jrib	brandon^	give that a try then
