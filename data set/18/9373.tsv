2007-04-19T09:26:00.000Z	chewed-on		If I try to install Ubuntu, will it overwrite Fedora Core 6 ?
2007-04-19T09:26:00.000Z	Daverocks	chewed-on	depends how you install it
2007-04-19T09:27:00.000Z	Daverocks	chewed-on	you can
2007-04-19T09:27:00.000Z	chewed-on	Daverocks	oh hell yes, please do explain.
2007-04-19T09:27:00.000Z	Daverocks	chewed-on	you could always get the gparted live cd
2007-04-19T09:27:00.000Z	chewed-on	Daverocks	how do I make it so I can have both Ubuntu and Fedora Core 6 co-exist without formating my hard drive ?
2007-04-19T09:28:00.000Z	chewed-on	Daverocks	that's the problem, gparted couldn't partition my hard drive because Fedora Core 6 uses Logical Volume Management.
2007-04-19T09:28:00.000Z	Daverocks	chewed-on	make room for another ext3 partition, and tell the ubuntu installer to install to that one. you can use the same swap partition for FC6 and ubuntu, because they won't be running at the same time
2007-04-19T09:28:00.000Z	Daverocks	chewed-on	really?
2007-04-19T09:28:00.000Z	chewed-on	Daverocks	yeah. . .
2007-04-19T09:33:00.000Z	Daverocks	chewed-on	looks like the alternate ubuntu CD has support for LVM partitioning
2007-04-19T09:33:00.000Z	chewed-on	Daverocks	hey ?
2007-04-19T09:34:00.000Z	Daverocks	chewed-on	the alternate, text-based install CD
2007-04-19T09:35:00.000Z	chewed-on	Daverocks	will it be able to partition my Fedora so I can install Ubuntu ?
2007-04-19T09:35:00.000Z	Daverocks	chewed-on	possibly :P
2007-04-19T09:49:00.000Z	Daverocks	chewed-on	yes
2007-04-19T09:50:00.000Z	chewed-on	Daverocks	bah, sucky
