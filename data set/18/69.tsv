2012-10-15T20:16:00.000Z	dr_willis	Will123467	 last i looked unetbootin dident do persistant live setups. but it may now. the pendrivelinux site has nu erous tools that can
2012-10-15T20:16:00.000Z	Will123467	dr_willis	it does if you're installing ubuntu, it lets you specify the amount of space you want to dedicate etc.
2012-10-15T20:16:00.000Z	Will123467	dr_willis	if unetbootin is an okay way to do it then i'm happy with that - was just double checking :)
2012-10-15T20:17:00.000Z	dr_willis	Will123467	 i tend to use other tools.. but i also tend to do 'full' normal installs to larger sized usb flash also
2012-10-15T20:19:00.000Z	Will123467	dr_willis	this is an 8 gig drive. what do you recommend?
2012-10-15T20:19:00.000Z	Will123467		should i go with a full normal install?
2012-10-15T20:20:00.000Z	dr_willis	Will123467	 depends on your needs.  live setups can get confused if you use a persistant save and install a lot of extras/update them
2012-10-15T20:21:00.000Z	Will123467	dr_willis	this is for a normal computer user friend who has a dodgy harddrive. so she needs something she can just plug in to her laptop and have it work in emergencies. you think a full install is better in this case?
2012-10-15T20:21:00.000Z	dr_willis	Will123467	 flash drives are cheap make one of each. ;P
2012-10-15T20:22:00.000Z	dr_willis		id suggest 16gb+ for a full install. 8gb may be tight
2012-10-15T20:22:00.000Z	dr_willis		but for just web surfing and stuff should work
2012-10-15T20:22:00.000Z	Will123467	dr_willis	shop is closed now, i've only got one drive and i'm going to see her tomorrow. so making two is out of the question :P plus i don't like her that much and i hate spending money
2012-10-15T20:22:00.000Z	Will123467		yeah it's just a back up thing
2012-10-15T20:22:00.000Z	dr_willis		stick with live then
2012-10-15T20:23:00.000Z	Will123467		okay, thanks :) shame 12.04.2 isn't out yet eh
2012-10-15T20:23:00.000Z	dr_willis	Will123467	 12.10 due out in a few days
2012-10-15T20:24:00.000Z	Will123467	dr_willis	right, but i'm seeing her tomorrow and then she's leaving the country, so that's not great timing
