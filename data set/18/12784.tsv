2006-12-10T06:20:00.000Z	s|k		I just installed epiphany on my computer but I can't find it
2006-12-10T06:20:00.000Z	s|k		in fact I just did ls -R epiphany* from root directory
2006-12-10T06:20:00.000Z	s|k		and it found nothing
2006-12-10T06:20:00.000Z	s|k		can someone tell me how I can find this thing I just installed?
2006-12-10T06:21:00.000Z	mnoir	s|k	how did you install it?
2006-12-10T06:21:00.000Z	s|k	mnoir	via apt
2006-12-10T06:21:00.000Z	s|k		it said it installed it
2006-12-10T06:21:00.000Z	mnoir		then use the apt command to look for what files are in the package or better yet, use synaptic
2006-12-10T06:22:00.000Z	s|k	mnoir	what is the apt command?
2006-12-10T06:23:00.000Z	mnoir		the apt command is what you used to install it, probably
2006-12-10T06:23:00.000Z	mnoir		or use 'type' or 'whereis'
2006-12-10T06:24:00.000Z	s|k		hrm it says I installed a clone of boulder dash
2006-12-10T06:25:00.000Z	s|k		not the browser

2006-12-10T06:25:00.000Z	s|k		thanks
