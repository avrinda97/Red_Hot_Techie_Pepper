2011-05-14T08:09:00.000Z	Mjolnir		dasei hey guys need your help: im trying super hard to install ubuntu but no luck... i md5sumed it and it checks out OK... my bios are set properly and i can see it with my hardrives...
2011-05-14T08:10:00.000Z	syrinx_	Mjolnir	so...what happened?
2011-05-14T08:18:00.000Z	syrinx_	Mjolnir	could be a bad burn
2011-05-14T08:18:00.000Z	Mjolnir	syrinx_	i md5sum'd it tho, it checks out
2011-05-14T08:19:00.000Z	syrinx_	Mjolnir	you md5'd the iso, not the disc...
2011-05-14T08:20:00.000Z	Mjolnir	syrinx_	whats the difference? the only thing on the disk is the iso
2011-05-14T08:20:00.000Z	syrinx_	Mjolnir	burn errors
2011-05-14T08:21:00.000Z	Mjolnir	syrinx_	dasei i would say that too except the issue is with 1 ubuntu disk and 2 backtrack cd's too... confusing...
2011-05-14T08:21:00.000Z	Mjolnir	syrinx_	dasei did i burnem all wrong?
2011-05-14T08:21:00.000Z	syrinx_	Mjolnir	none of them work?
2011-05-14T08:22:00.000Z	Mjolnir	syrinx_	nope
2011-05-14T08:22:00.000Z	syrinx_	Mjolnir	yea, id say burn errors, try burning one again at 8x
2011-05-14T08:25:00.000Z	syrinx_	Mjolnir	yea, no reason to download again if the md5 checks out, just burn it again at a slow speed
2011-05-14T08:42:00.000Z	Mjolnir	syrinx_	dasei and guys, im burning ubuntu at slowest possible speed, 10x(K3B). is there a specific writing mode? or just leave it on auto?
2011-05-14T08:42:00.000Z	syrinx_	Mjolnir	auto is good
2011-05-14T08:42:00.000Z	Mjolnir	syrinx_	k thanks
2011-05-14T10:48:00.000Z	syrinx_	Mjolnir	what happened?
2011-05-14T10:50:00.000Z	Mjolnir	syrinx_	i installed ubuntu, it asked for restart, so i did, it loads up on this screen where its talking aboiut broadcom and then PXE-E53: no boot filename recieved and then another cmd line with operating system not found
