2010-11-19T08:58:00.000Z	willis__		i've attempted to plug an ethernet cable directly into the router from the pc to see if networking in general is a problem, and it's not connecting that way either, same result as trying to connect to wifi. the network icon moves a lot and then it eventually tells me i'm disconnected
2010-11-19T08:59:00.000Z	hypatia	willis__	sounds like there might be an issue with your router
2010-11-19T08:59:00.000Z	hypatia	willis__	have you tried running dhclient from the commandline and seeing what it does?
2010-11-19T09:00:00.000Z	willis__	hypatia	dhclient listst a lot of "permission denied" things
2010-11-19T09:01:00.000Z	hypatia	willis__	you need to do it as sudo
2010-11-19T09:04:00.000Z	hypatia	willis__	that's normal; that's your wireless and your wired interfaces
2010-11-19T09:04:00.000Z	hypatia	willis__	yeah so it's not getting any offers from the router
2010-11-19T09:05:00.000Z	hypatia	willis__	that was the next thing i was going to ask you, that's mega weird
2010-11-19T09:05:00.000Z	hypatia	willis__	cool, sorry for the newbie instructions then :)
2010-11-19T09:06:00.000Z	hypatia	willis__	question: open wifi or closed?
2010-11-19T09:06:00.000Z	hypatia	willis__	one kinda wacky thing you see sometimes is if it's an open network and other people are using it, you /can/ run out of dhcp addresses
2010-11-19T09:07:00.000Z	hypatia	willis__	one more sillyish thing to try: reboot the router
2010-11-19T09:08:00.000Z	hypatia	willis__	what do you mean the interface devices?
2010-11-19T09:08:00.000Z	hypatia	willis__	is this a desktop or laptop?
2010-11-19T09:09:00.000Z	hypatia	willis__	about the network configuration - is it DHCP to a public IP, or a NAT'ed IP?
2010-11-19T09:12:00.000Z	hypatia	willis__	i'm sorry to hear that... but yeah, it should just be a matter of formatting the partition :/
2010-11-19T09:12:00.000Z	hypatia	willis__	you might wanna try the wubi installer for ubuntu
2010-11-19T09:12:00.000Z	hypatia	willis__	was this 10.10 or 10.04?
