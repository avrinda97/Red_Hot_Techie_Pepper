2008-06-17T22:40:00.000Z	HardDisk	Inazad	if you want.
2008-06-17T22:41:00.000Z	HardDisk	Inazad	use gparted livecd
2008-06-17T22:41:00.000Z	HardDisk	Inazad	or via ubuntu cd
2008-06-17T22:41:00.000Z	Inazad	HardDisk	when I'm resizing my sda5, the available space is in the extended partition and I can't use it...
2008-06-17T22:41:00.000Z	Inazad	HardDisk	I'm on a livecd
2008-06-17T22:42:00.000Z	HardDisk	Inazad	what is that partition and have it unmounted
2008-06-17T22:42:00.000Z	Inazad	HardDisk	sda5 and istn't mounted
2008-06-17T22:42:00.000Z	HardDisk	Inazad	you have to resize it to make it smaller, then the free space add it to the new partition
2008-06-17T22:43:00.000Z	HardDisk	Inazad	as nomasteryoda said
2008-06-17T22:43:00.000Z	Inazad	HardDisk	how to add it into the sda1 ? I can't because its stake into the extended partition
2008-06-17T22:43:00.000Z	HardDisk	Inazad	I would read how to resize since you're inexperienced with partitions.
2008-06-17T22:43:00.000Z	Inazad	HardDisk	I know how to resize due
2008-06-17T22:44:00.000Z	Inazad	HardDisk	when i'm clicking to resize my sda1, there are no space to enlarge it..
2008-06-17T22:44:00.000Z	HardDisk	Inazad	then you should know you have to make the extended smaller, then slide it to the left if the partition you want to expand is to the left
2008-06-17T22:44:00.000Z	HardDisk	Inazad	I mean the freespace or move the data partition to the right
2008-06-17T22:45:00.000Z	Inazad	HardDisk	ok I understand.. i'll try
