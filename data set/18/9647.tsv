2007-04-19T09:09:00.000Z	ravi_		having trouble connecting to anything but PORT 3389, changed it to 60 in regedit, and can't connect now with rdesktop command or tsclient.
2007-04-19T09:10:00.000Z	ravi_		please help
2007-04-19T09:11:00.000Z	PhilK	ravi_	did you reboot?  the change doesn't take effect until you restart the remote desktop service
2007-04-19T09:11:00.000Z	ravi_	PhilK	Positive, rebooted
2007-04-19T09:12:00.000Z	ravi_	PhilK	I also tried 192.168.1.100:60 on the tsclient
2007-04-19T09:14:00.000Z	PhilK	ravi_	are you crossing a firewall?  can you use a higher port? (I think I remember something about low ports being disallowed)
2007-04-19T09:15:00.000Z	PhilK	ravi_	does netstat -a show anything listening on 60?
2007-04-19T09:15:00.000Z	PhilK	ravi_	try port 3390 and up
2007-04-19T09:16:00.000Z	ravi_	PhilK	ok, will try higher port but netstat -a gives a listening port on 60
2007-04-19T09:16:00.000Z	PhilK	ravi_	can you telnet into the windows machine?  (telnet <ip> 3389
2007-04-19T09:16:00.000Z	PhilK	ravi_	or in your case telnet 192.168.1.100 60
2007-04-19T09:17:00.000Z	PhilK	ravi_	for the love of god disable that thing :(
2007-04-19T09:18:00.000Z	PhilK	ravi_	nope, Windows XP's firewall is very eager to help...unfortunately
2007-04-19T09:18:00.000Z	ravi_	PhilK	thanks... shoulda known it was something on windows
2007-04-19T09:18:00.000Z	PhilK	ravi_	no problem
2007-04-19T09:18:00.000Z	ravi_	PhilK	Yeah, this is on Windows x64 Pro
2007-04-19T09:20:00.000Z	ravi_	PhilK	btw, do you know how to ensure that I am running Feisty and not Feisty beta?
2007-04-19T09:21:00.000Z	PhilK	ravi_	feisty is feisty AFAIK, as long as you're up to date you're fine
