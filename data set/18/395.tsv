2012-06-04T14:20:00.000Z	gvo		ed_: you are holding the shift key down while it boots?  Not just press and release?
2012-06-04T14:21:00.000Z	gvo		ed_: Since Mint is based on Ubuntu, I suspect you'll not be able to do that.  Try Fedora.
2012-06-04T14:22:00.000Z	gvo		12.04 uses grub2 doesn't it?
2012-06-04T14:22:00.000Z	gvo		OK that's what he's trying to boot.
2012-06-04T14:23:00.000Z	gvo		np
2012-06-04T14:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gvo	grub2 has been default for ages now :)
2012-06-04T14:23:00.000Z	gvo	ActionParsnip	I know.
2012-06-04T14:24:00.000Z	gvo	ActionParsnip	auronandace had me questioning that knowledge, however.
2012-06-04T14:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gvo	why mint?
2012-06-04T14:39:00.000Z	gvo	ActionParsnip	I hate unity, kde4 and gnome 3, mostly.
2012-06-04T14:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gvo	tried LXDE?
2012-06-04T14:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gvo	or: www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2012/03/gnome-classic-in-ubuntu-12-04-its-like-nothing-ever-changed/
2012-06-04T14:41:00.000Z	gvo	ActionParsnip	Yes, lxde  has a couple of deficiencies and I didn't know bout the other one.
2012-06-04T14:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gvo	its simple to get the Gnome2 smell in Precise
2012-06-04T14:42:00.000Z	gvo	ActionParsnip	Since Gnome2 is eol, that's not a good long term solution.
2012-06-04T14:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gvo	it's not Gnome2, It's gnome3 with a different shell
2012-06-04T14:43:00.000Z	gvo	ActionParsnip	OK I'll look into it.
2012-06-04T14:43:00.000Z	gvo	ActionParsnip	thanks
