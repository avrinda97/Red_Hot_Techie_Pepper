2007-06-10T09:24:00.000Z	Monteh		guys i think i did something silly and my task bar is gone from my desktop,  :(
2007-06-10T09:24:00.000Z	Monteh		you know the taskbar you get when you install ubuntu >.> _Michael
2007-06-10T09:26:00.000Z	roryy	Monteh	try Alt+F2; you should get a "Run application" dialog box.  Type 'gnome-panel' there and press enter.
2007-06-10T09:32:00.000Z	roryy	Monteh	try Alt+F2; you should get a "Run application" dialog box.  Type 'gnome-panel' there and press enter.
2007-06-10T09:33:00.000Z	Monteh	roryy	it says it detected a panel already running...
2007-06-10T09:33:00.000Z	roryy	Monteh	hrm.  ok, Alt+F2, type 'gnome-terminal' and press enter; should opne a terminal window
2007-06-10T09:34:00.000Z	roryy	Monteh	now run 'pkill gnome-terminal'  (on my system that immediately relaunches gnome-panel, for what it's worth)
2007-06-10T09:34:00.000Z	roryy	Monteh	woah
2007-06-10T09:34:00.000Z	roryy	Monteh	i meant, 'pkill gnome-panel'
2007-06-10T09:36:00.000Z	Monteh	roryy	it didnt work, i think ive done something really stupid >_>
2007-06-10T09:36:00.000Z	roryy	Monteh	what happens when you run 'pkill gnome-panel' ?
2007-06-10T09:37:00.000Z	Monteh	roryy	my buddy list appears from gaim lol :s
2007-06-10T09:38:00.000Z	roryy	Monteh	hrm.  I think i found a solution here https://answers.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/gnome-panel/+question/7759
2007-06-10T09:39:00.000Z	roryy	Monteh	need me to help you through it, or can you manage?
2007-06-10T09:47:00.000Z	roryy	Monteh	did the web page not do the necessary?
2007-06-10T09:48:00.000Z	Monteh	roryy	nope it just hangs when you input the first of the 3 commands it asks you to do :S
2007-06-10T09:51:00.000Z	roryy	Monteh	doh!  If you're up to it, you could try logging out, going to the text console (Ctl+Alt+F1), login there and run the gconftool-2 command given there; then Alt+F7 (to get back to login) and login as normal.
2007-06-10T10:12:00.000Z	roryy	Monteh	what did it take?
