2007-08-18T16:04:00.000Z	eifzon		hmm, i am trying to install ubuntu from the livecd, but it i cant make the last partition that is /home
2007-08-18T16:05:00.000Z	dennda	eifzon	More information about your planned partitioning would be very helpful.
2007-08-18T16:06:00.000Z	eifzon	dennda	I got a 500GB HDD, I want to make a 30GB / and 1GB Swap and rest on home but it doesent work
2007-08-18T16:07:00.000Z	dennda	eifzon	did you make / a primary partition and swap logical and /home logical?
2007-08-18T16:07:00.000Z	eifzon	dennda	if i am trying to make all space to to my home its just using like 70000mb
2007-08-18T16:08:00.000Z	dennda	eifzon	primary or logical partition?
2007-08-18T16:08:00.000Z	eifzon	dennda	all primary
2007-08-18T16:08:00.000Z	dennda	eifzon	and what kind of partition? (fat32, ext3, etc)
2007-08-18T16:08:00.000Z	dennda	eifzon	at least /home should be logical
2007-08-18T16:08:00.000Z	eifzon	dennda	nonoo
2007-08-18T16:08:00.000Z	dennda	eifzon	Why not?
2007-08-18T16:08:00.000Z	eifzon	dennda	why?
2007-08-18T16:09:00.000Z	dennda	eifzon	I do prefer alternate, too. But I still don't get the point why you want to make /home a primary partition.
2007-08-18T16:12:00.000Z	dennda	eifzon	Just make it a logical partition and all should be fine.
2007-08-18T05:45:00.000Z	dennda	eifzon	system -> preferences -> sessions
2007-08-18T05:45:00.000Z	eifzon	dennda	and?
2007-08-18T05:45:00.000Z	dennda	eifzon	-> Autostart
2007-08-18T05:46:00.000Z	eifzon	dennda	i just choosed the file there :)
