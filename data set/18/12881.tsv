2006-02-28T09:08:00.000Z	exxpert		Question, when I run -anything- with sudo, I don't get any confirmations or outputs of any kind. Like sudo echo test, won't show anything :S Any ideas?
2006-02-28T09:09:00.000Z	poningru	exxpert	you should have gotten a password prompt
2006-02-28T09:09:00.000Z	poningru	exxpert	where are you typing that?
2006-02-28T09:09:00.000Z	exxpert	poningru	well yes, I type in the password, but the actual command doesn't give any output
2006-02-28T09:11:00.000Z	poningru	exxpert	it should have said test
2006-02-28T09:11:00.000Z	exxpert	poningru	hence my concern, because it doesn't
