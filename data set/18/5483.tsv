2008-10-16T20:02:00.000Z	lostonthehill		OK, I know this is a dreadful question, but does anyone have any useful info on getting an Option GT MAX 3.6 Express wireless card working?
2008-10-16T20:02:00.000Z	soundray	lostonthehill	how is it connected, PCI or USB?
2008-10-16T20:02:00.000Z	lostonthehill	soundray	PCI
2008-10-16T20:03:00.000Z	soundray	lostonthehill	how does it report when you run lspci?
2008-10-16T20:04:00.000Z	lostonthehill	soundray	i can't get that right now, i'm running windows atm so i can connect
2008-10-16T20:05:00.000Z	soundray	lostonthehill	can you find out from Windows device manager what chipset it uses, or at least the name of the driver (something.INF)?
2008-10-16T20:08:00.000Z	lostonthehill	soundray	would "Gtm51lrp.sys" be it?  that's the driver it's reporting at least
2008-10-16T20:11:00.000Z	soundray	lostonthehill	is that a card for mobile networks or WLAN?
2008-10-16T20:13:00.000Z	soundray	lostonthehill	hello?
2008-10-16T20:15:00.000Z	lostonthehill	soundray	 It lists the driver as "Gtm51lrp.sys", or did i lose a response in the noise?
2008-10-16T20:15:00.000Z	soundray	lostonthehill	is that a card for mobile networks or WLAN?
2008-10-16T20:16:00.000Z	lostonthehill	soundray	mobile networks
2008-10-16T20:16:00.000Z	soundray	lostonthehill	which version of Ubuntu do you have?
2008-10-16T20:17:00.000Z	lostonthehill	soundray	8.04
2008-10-16T20:19:00.000Z	soundray	lostonthehill	8.10, which comes out in a fortnight, will have expanded support for HSDPA (mobile/cellular) network cards. If it was my system, I'd wait and upgrade (or even upgrade to the current beta)
2008-10-16T20:21:00.000Z	lostonthehill	soundray	That's good news, i might give the beta a shot and quit messing around with it before i break something i can't fix
2008-10-16T20:22:00.000Z	soundray	lostonthehill	please back up your current system, since you won't be able to downgrade
2008-10-16T20:22:00.000Z	lostonthehill	soundray	good call
