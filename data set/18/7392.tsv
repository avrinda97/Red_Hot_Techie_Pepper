2008-05-10T05:23:00.000Z	IrishDavid		hey, im trying to set up a USB key with ubuntu installed so that I can take it to uni and use it. Where would I get a good tutorial? I want to be able to have fully functioning in terms of installing software and my writing to my home dir but be able to run on any machine
2008-05-10T05:23:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	IrishDavid	how big is your usb?
2008-05-10T05:24:00.000Z	IrishDavid	Odd-rationale	 i've got a 400gb external that I want to test with and then im going to purchase a 16gb flash drive
2008-05-10T05:25:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	IrishDavid	oh. that big. then hat is easy. just do a normal install. select your usb as the harddrive to install it on. and be sure to install grub on your usb key NOT the internal hdd.
2008-05-10T05:26:00.000Z	IrishDavid	Odd-rationale	do you not need to do anything so that it is still in live mode on boot to recognise hardware?
2008-05-10T05:27:00.000Z	IrishDavid	Odd-rationale	I want to be able to boot on lots of different machines in uni to do work
2008-05-10T05:27:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	IrishDavid	in fact, what I did ( and many other) is just remove all drives in cluding internal hdd from the machine, attach your usb, boot the live cd and install. that way grub will automatiucally install in the correct place
2008-05-10T05:27:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	IrishDavid	uni == university ?
2008-05-10T05:27:00.000Z	IrishDavid	Odd-rationale	yes
2008-05-10T05:29:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	IrishDavid	well first you have to know whether the machines at the university will boot from usb...
2008-05-10T05:29:00.000Z	IrishDavid	Odd-rationale	already tested and I know it will work
2008-05-10T05:30:00.000Z	IrishDavid	Odd-rationale	I just want to know what way to go about setting up my drive so that it will work persistently on changing hardware configurations?
2008-05-10T05:31:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	IrishDavid	that is kind of tricky, ubuntu should detect most of the hardware on boot. so you should not really have any trouble with that. you might want to use the vesa drivers instead of nvdia, ati or what have you. as vesa works almost universally.
2008-05-10T05:31:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	IrishDavid	also, you might want to use ext2 instead of ext3 to extend to life of your flash drive...
2008-05-10T05:31:00.000Z	IrishDavid	Odd-rationale	I'll give it a shot, I know the computers at uni will be using either intel 950 or nvidia
2008-05-10T05:32:00.000Z	IrishDavid	Odd-rationale	thanks for your help
2008-05-10T05:32:00.000Z	Odd-rationale	IrishDavid	other that, you should be able to install as normal.
