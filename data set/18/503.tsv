2012-09-14T04:48:00.000Z	liberty223		Hi I am running 12.04, with ultrabook with Intel 4000 graphics. When I launch certain games eg bastion, I get absolutely no graphics, just the cursor and sound
2012-09-14T04:48:00.000Z	liberty223		Should I update to new kernel and if so what is best way to do so
2012-09-14T04:50:00.000Z	wifioregon	liberty223	 updating kernel isnt going to help
2012-09-14T04:50:00.000Z	wifioregon	liberty223	 try running the "additional drivers" application
2012-09-14T04:50:00.000Z	wifioregon	liberty223	 its built into Ubuntu
2012-09-14T04:50:00.000Z	wifioregon	liberty223	 and then install your graphics drivers
2012-09-14T04:50:00.000Z	wifioregon	liberty223	 perhaps its not good enough to play games?
2012-09-14T04:52:00.000Z	wifioregon	liberty223	 do the updates
2012-09-14T04:52:00.000Z	wifioregon	liberty223	 that will update kernel
2012-09-14T04:52:00.000Z	wifioregon	liberty223	 open terminal and run:  sudo apt-get update ; sudo apt-get upgrade
2012-09-14T04:52:00.000Z	wifioregon	liberty223	 then you should have the newest terminal. Check the update GUI as well
2012-09-14T04:52:00.000Z	wifioregon	liberty223	 recently I had to do the kernel update with the GUI
2012-09-14T04:53:00.000Z	wifioregon	liberty223	 also you can use the terminal to find what kernel version you currently have
2012-09-14T04:53:00.000Z	wifioregon	liberty223	 or you should see it in grub
2012-09-14T04:53:00.000Z	wifioregon	liberty223	 3.2.0-31-generic
2012-09-14T04:53:00.000Z	wifioregon	liberty223	 is what I have
2012-09-14T04:53:00.000Z	wifioregon	liberty223	 And I do the updates. 12.04
2012-09-14T04:54:00.000Z	wifioregon	liberty223	 run the GUI update then
