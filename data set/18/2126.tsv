2010-09-03T23:00:00.000Z	spitzi		H, disconnected so I'll ask again: I had Ubuntu on one partition and installed Vista on another partition. Vista took over the boot and doesn't recognize Ubuntu. How can I configure a boot menu that features both OS's ?
2010-09-03T23:00:00.000Z	shirtless	spitzi	boot into ubuntu using the cd and install grub
2010-09-03T23:01:00.000Z	spitzi		shirtless - Should the live CD allow me to boot into ubuntu ? Thought it only allows installing the OS.
2010-09-03T23:02:00.000Z	shirtless	spitzi	it will allow you to boot into ubuntu, yes. that's why it's 'live'
2010-09-03T23:02:00.000Z	shirtless	spitzi	grub install info is on the ubuntu website
2010-09-03T23:02:00.000Z	spitzi		shirtless - oh, you mean it will not load the already installed Ubuntu but boot from CD. How do I install grub then ?
2010-09-03T23:03:00.000Z	shirtless	spitzi	you don't need to be booted into your ubuntu install to install grub. just boot from cd and google for ubuntu grub install. it's like 3 easy steps
2010-09-03T23:03:00.000Z	shirtless		you might want to search grub2 instead
2010-09-03T23:03:00.000Z	shirtless		because things have changed
2010-09-03T23:03:00.000Z	shirtless		it will probably detect windows for you.
2010-09-03T23:04:00.000Z	spitzi		shirtless - thanks ! And are you actually shirtless ? Are you Australian ?
2010-09-03T23:04:00.000Z	shirtless	spitzi	i am from the US, but I am not wearing a shirt. Can you clue me in on the australian part?
2010-09-03T23:04:00.000Z	spitzi	shirtless	thought it's an Aussi thing.
2010-09-03T23:05:00.000Z	shirtless		heh
2010-09-03T23:07:00.000Z	spitzi		shirtless - I'm too lazy to go over search results in ubuntu.com. Can you give me a link to the grub install info page ?
2010-09-03T23:08:00.000Z	shirtless	spitzi	sure, 1 sec
2010-09-03T23:08:00.000Z	shirtless	spitzi	i am going to pm you the link
2010-09-03T23:09:00.000Z	shirtless	spitzi	;)
