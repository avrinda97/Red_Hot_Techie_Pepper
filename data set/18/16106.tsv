2005-04-07T10:25:00.000Z	crimsun	protocol	for e17?  It's preferred that you build from cvs.
2005-04-07T10:26:00.000Z	protocol	crimsun	lol it's "preferred"...I don't want through go through all that :P
2005-04-07T10:28:00.000Z	crimsun	protocol	I haven't used E since the DR15 days, so I'm fairly rusty on its specific, current packaging
