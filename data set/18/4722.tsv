2009-03-28T10:21:00.000Z	homerhomer	Incarus	I have had nothing but issue with my ATI card on my laptop.
2009-03-28T10:21:00.000Z	homerhomer	Incarus	and my Nvidia on my desktop has been smooth as silk
2009-03-28T10:21:00.000Z	Incarus	homerhomer	ati dont want to support the old cards
2009-03-28T10:22:00.000Z	homerhomer	Incarus	did you say that you installed fglrx 9.3 on Jaunty?
2009-03-28T10:22:00.000Z	Incarus	homerhomer	no, not really, i use SiS
2009-03-28T10:22:00.000Z	homerhomer	Incarus	bah ha ha

2009-03-28T10:24:00.000Z	homerhomer	Incarus	I'm jealous, how about suspend? does it work
2009-03-28T10:24:00.000Z	Incarus	homerhomer	in intrepid, but not in jaunty
2009-03-28T10:25:00.000Z	homerhomer	Incarus	I guess, free has its price.
2009-03-28T10:25:00.000Z	Incarus	homerhomer	but its more secure
2009-03-28T10:25:00.000Z	homerhomer	Incarus	I agree, I'm sticking with nix.
