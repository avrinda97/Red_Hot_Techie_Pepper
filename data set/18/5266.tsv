2008-11-17T14:30:00.000Z	coz_	fresco20	  i just saw your post   what is the hardware configuration of your system?
2008-11-17T14:31:00.000Z	fresco20	coz_	i have a dual core, with gma 950 and 1g of ram
2008-11-17T14:31:00.000Z	coz_	fresco20	ok and what was the issue with compiz fusion?
2008-11-17T14:31:00.000Z	fresco20		compiz used to work out of the box but recently it has disappeared and i cannot reenable it
2008-11-17T14:32:00.000Z	fresco20		i guess due to some system updates
2008-11-17T14:32:00.000Z	coz_	fresco20	 mm well the hardware can handle it for sure   I am curious which system updates may have caused this to fail
2008-11-17T14:33:00.000Z	fresco20	coz_	i was wondering too :(
2008-11-17T14:33:00.000Z	coz_	fresco20	 how did you uninstall compiz fusion?
2008-11-17T14:34:00.000Z	fresco20	coz_	i went to synaptic and remove every compiz-related packages
2008-11-17T14:34:00.000Z	coz_	fresco20	are you running Gnome?
2008-11-17T14:34:00.000Z	fresco20	coz_	for sure
2008-11-17T14:34:00.000Z	coz_	fresco20	well actually all you really had to do was go to system/preferences/appearacne/visual effects and select "None" to shut it down
2008-11-17T14:36:00.000Z	fresco20	coz_	lol, in fact it got done automatically, anyway, i'll reboot the system now. the thing is i was trying to upload around 100mb of pics to Flickr and Firefox just hung, though the upload process was still runing
2008-11-17T14:36:00.000Z	coz_	fresco20	no harm in reinstalling it and if you do  also include compizconfig-settings-manager  open that with ccsm   then
2008-11-17T14:36:00.000Z	coz_	fresco20	then  just above the "Close" button is preferences  if compiz fusion is again not working  hit the reset to default button and change the backend to flat-file to see if that fixes anything
2008-11-17T14:37:00.000Z	fresco20		has anyone also tried the new bitdefender for unices, it scanned the same proc/task folder for almost 2 hours, funny AV
2008-11-17T14:37:00.000Z	fresco20	coz_	ok thanks :)
2008-11-17T14:38:00.000Z	coz_	fresco20	 also since you have intel I would stop in at #compiz-fusion and speak with crdlb about this
