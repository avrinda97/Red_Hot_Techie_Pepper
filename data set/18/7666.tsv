2007-12-03T01:24:00.000Z	Dextorion	tommy`	myeah.. glanced at them. looks okay to me. if the information is correct that is.
2007-12-03T01:24:00.000Z	tommy`	Dextorion	could be a Bios problem?
2007-12-03T01:24:00.000Z	Dextorion	tommy`	take a look in your bios, and make sure your discs are set to AUTO.
2007-12-03T01:24:00.000Z	Dextorion	tommy`	yes
2007-12-03T01:25:00.000Z	tommy`	Dextorion	is better load default option of bios?
2007-12-03T01:25:00.000Z	Dextorion	tommy`	you probably have the option to set up where your discs actually are mounted in your computer. And those settings usually override how they actually are setup. and that could cause problems.. perhaps a long shot, i dont know.
2007-12-03T01:37:00.000Z	tommy`	Dextorion	thanks dude, I've fix my problem, I load default setup, now all is ok
2007-12-03T01:37:00.000Z	Dextorion	tommy`	goodie :)
2007-12-03T01:37:00.000Z	tommy`	Dextorion	I'm so curious to know what's in my bios was wrong to hang up grub
2007-12-03T01:39:00.000Z	Dextorion	tommy`	hmm.. myeah. sometimes when the discs are set to a user defined value instead of AUTO bootloaders get confused.
2007-12-03T01:39:00.000Z	Dextorion	tommy`	might have been something like that.
