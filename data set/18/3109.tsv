2009-12-13T01:05:00.000Z	UbuntuChickie		Urgh.  Having a weird semi urgent issue.  I was working with something fairly critical in a VirtualBox session and than I switched tried to switch out and go into Firefox on my Host (Ubuntu) and got into Firefox, but somehow the Guest Virtual BOx session still has my mouse focus and I cannot get back to it.  I have also tried ALT+Tab with no avail.  I can get to a command prompt via keys and I have tried gnome system monitor but it 
2009-12-13T01:06:00.000Z	UbuntuChickie		Its weird cause I am able to use the keyboard but ALT+Tab doesn't seem to work nor the mouse
2009-12-13T01:07:00.000Z	jrib	UbuntuChickie	right ctrl ?
2009-12-13T01:07:00.000Z	jrib	UbuntuChickie	try #vbox
2009-12-13T01:08:00.000Z	jrib	UbuntuChickie	maybe wmctrl...
2009-12-13T01:11:00.000Z	jrib	UbuntuChickie	wmctrl is a command you run in a terminal window (which you asked about)
2009-12-13T01:17:00.000Z	jrib	UbuntuChickie	no, you can porbably get to ctrl-alt-f1 though.  ctrl-alt-f7 brings you back
2009-12-13T01:17:00.000Z	jrib	UbuntuChickie	are you sure your window manager didn't die or something?
2009-12-13T01:21:00.000Z	jrib	UbuntuChickie	man wmctrl  for documentation
2009-12-13T01:23:00.000Z	jrib	UbuntuChickie	man wmctrl<enter>/list<enter>n
2009-12-13T01:31:00.000Z	jrib	UbuntuChickie	prefix your command with "DISPLAY=:0"
2009-12-13T01:32:00.000Z	jrib	UbuntuChickie	no...
2009-12-13T01:36:00.000Z	jrib	UbuntuChickie	you wanted to use wmctrl -a remember?
2009-12-13T01:38:00.000Z	jrib	UbuntuChickie	see what the man page says.
2009-12-13T01:38:00.000Z	jrib	UbuntuChickie	(or try and see)
2009-12-13T01:42:00.000Z	UbuntuChickie	jrib	 do you mind if I PM you?  there is too much going on in here
2009-12-13T01:43:00.000Z	jrib	UbuntuChickie	better to stay in the channel so others can help and benefit too, just read your highlights and ignore the rest
