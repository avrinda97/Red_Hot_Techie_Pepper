2011-12-19T07:26:00.000Z	Charybdis	jasonmchristos	Why would you want to do that?
2011-12-19T07:20:00.000Z	Charybdis	jasonmchristos	Are you talking about the package rtkit, or a rootkit?
2011-12-19T07:20:00.000Z	jasonmchristos	Charybdis	i didnt install any package rtkit
2011-12-19T07:20:00.000Z	Charybdis	jasonmchristos	You don't have to.
2011-12-19T07:21:00.000Z	Charybdis	jasonmchristos	It's part of pulseaudio.
2011-12-19T07:21:00.000Z	jasonmchristos	Charybdis	how do i pull up info on the package then
2011-12-19T07:24:00.000Z	Charybdis	jasonmchristos	Your system has processes running all the time.
2011-12-19T07:25:00.000Z	jasonmchristos	Charybdis	i cant keep track of all of those
2011-12-19T07:25:00.000Z	Charybdis	jasonmchristos	I know.  That's why you keep your system locked down as tight as you can and only use trusted sources.
2011-12-19T07:25:00.000Z	jasonmchristos	Charybdis	is there a way to redue it to say 5 or 10
2011-12-19T07:25:00.000Z	Charybdis	jasonmchristos	Hell no.  Those are system files.
2011-12-19T07:25:00.000Z	Charybdis	jasonmchristos	Do you mean the display?
2011-12-19T07:25:00.000Z	jasonmchristos	Charybdis	i like to know whats going on though
2011-12-19T07:26:00.000Z	jasonmchristos	Charybdis	why not, people act like knowing is a bad thing
2011-12-19T07:27:00.000Z	Charybdis	jasonmchristos	That's every driver, every file, every daemon, every process the system needed to boot and run and maintain itself, still running.
2011-12-19T07:29:00.000Z	Charybdis	jasonmchristos	Here's a hint... if you are that paranoid, pull the plug, you don't need to be on a computer.
