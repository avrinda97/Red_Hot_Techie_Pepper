2012-08-30T04:27:00.000Z	Ben64	fire	why didn't you install nvidia with the Hardware Drivers program
2012-08-30T04:29:00.000Z	Ben64	fire	do you get an error or anything now when you start ubuntu
2012-08-30T04:31:00.000Z	Ben64	fire	can you get to a console? (ctrl+alt+f1)
2012-08-30T04:32:00.000Z	Ben64	fire	yes
2012-08-30T04:34:00.000Z	Ben64	fire	can you pastebin your /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2012-08-30T04:36:00.000Z	Ben64	fire	try this on command line - "cat /etc/X11/xorg.conf | pastebinit"
2012-08-30T04:39:00.000Z	Ben64	fire	ok then... try this... "cat /etc/X11/xorg.conf | curl -F 'sprunge=<-' http://sprunge.us"
2012-08-30T04:43:00.000Z	Ben64	fire	what happens if you do "sudo modprobe nvidia"
2012-08-30T04:44:00.000Z	Ben64	fire	ok then the problem is you don't have the nvidia driver
2012-08-30T04:45:00.000Z	Ben64	fire	dpkg -l  | grep nvidia
2012-08-30T04:46:00.000Z	fire	Ben64	i can see some nvidia thing :P
2012-08-30T04:47:00.000Z	Ben64	fire	let me see.... "dpkg -l  | grep nvidia | curl -F 'sprunge=<-' http://sprunge.us"
2012-08-30T04:51:00.000Z	Ben64	fire	anyway you could delete /etc/X11/xorg.conf and then you will be able to boot and install the nvidia driver
2012-08-30T04:56:00.000Z	Ben64	fire	run jockey-gtk
2012-08-30T05:04:00.000Z	Ben64	fire	yeah
