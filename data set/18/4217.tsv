2010-11-10T22:01:00.000Z	Dantix		hi all! I'm trying to install desktop version and the computer hangs with the white Ubuntu's logo on black screen and blinking CapsLock/ScrollLock. Where can I start to troubleshoot this?
2010-11-10T22:03:00.000Z	X-Sleepy-X	Dantix	The flashing thing on capslock etc sound like when i get kernel panic on an old laptop of mine....
2010-11-10T22:03:00.000Z	X-Sleepy-X	Dantix	what kind of pc hardware do you have?
2010-11-10T22:04:00.000Z	Dantix	X-Sleepy-X	regular asrock with SiS chipset, Celeron 800, 640Mb RAM
2010-11-10T22:05:00.000Z	X-Sleepy-X	Dantix	sound like it should work. have you tested the alternate cd?
2010-11-10T22:05:00.000Z	Dantix	X-Sleepy-X	I'm just downloading the new 10.10
2010-11-10T22:06:00.000Z	X-Sleepy-X	Dantix	as alternate?
2010-11-10T22:07:00.000Z	Dantix	X-Sleepy-X	yes, but are ther a way to get more information from the installer?
2010-11-10T22:08:00.000Z	X-Sleepy-X	Dantix	perhaps if you press ctrl alt f1 or f2 to get to a console mode...
2010-11-10T22:08:00.000Z	X-Sleepy-X	Dantix	im not sure though
2010-11-10T22:09:00.000Z	Dantix	X-Sleepy-X	ok I'll try that, anyway thanks!
2010-11-10T22:09:00.000Z	X-Sleepy-X	Dantix	you could perhaps also start the installer without the quiet option if you're able to and if it is one...
2010-11-10T22:10:00.000Z	Dantix	X-Sleepy-X	I didn't see such option on installer screen
2010-11-10T22:10:00.000Z	X-Sleepy-X	Dantix	perhaps you'll see it in the alternate cd
2010-11-10T22:11:00.000Z	Dantix	X-Sleepy-X	right
2010-11-10T22:11:00.000Z	X-Sleepy-X	Dantix	by pressing one of the F# keys
2010-11-10T22:11:00.000Z	Dantix	X-Sleepy-X	I'll try to find it, thanks
2010-11-10T22:12:00.000Z	X-Sleepy-X	Dantix	best of luck
