2007-12-01T07:07:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix		I'm looking at an emacs interface for the first time because i want to learn to use 'r' and I'm told ESS (emacs speaks statistics) is the way to go, but I am really displeased with the display. It looks bad, like what gnucash looked like in Feisty. Any ideas on improving font rendering, at the very least?
2007-12-01T07:09:00.000Z	kelsin	ArthurArchnix	you can install emacs 23 from http://peadrop.com/blog/2007/01/06/pretty-emacs/
2007-12-01T07:11:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	kelsin	Beauty. Thanks.
2007-12-01T07:13:00.000Z	kelsin	ArthurArchnix	you can install the emacs-snapshot-gtk official package just to get gtk widgets, but that package from that blog also includes nice XFT font support
2007-12-01T07:32:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	kelsin	You know what it was? your second comment there started me looking through synaptic. The thing is I wanted ess, but when I selected that it installed emacs 21 as the dependency. Emacs 22's font rendering is fine, and is also available in the repository. As is the snapshots you mentioned. Now to see if ess is working with 22, and then if I can uninstall 21 without apt also removing ess. Sigh... :)
2007-12-01T07:33:00.000Z	kelsin	ArthurArchnix	yeah it can be slightly odd, but even if you have to remove all then install the snapshot package first, then the ess package you should be ok
2007-12-01T07:33:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	kelsin	Indeed. Well, thanks for the tips and such.
2007-12-01T07:33:00.000Z	kelsin	ArthurArchnix	np
2007-12-01T10:15:00.000Z	kelsin	ArthurArchnix	no it's not
2007-12-01T10:15:00.000Z	kelsin	ArthurArchnix	why I pointed you to that blog
2007-12-01T10:15:00.000Z	kelsin	ArthurArchnix	emacs does not have xft support until version 23 which is still dev and available on the emacs cvs which is what that guy packaged. Google "Ubuntu Pretty Emacs" to find it again
2007-12-01T10:18:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	kelsin	Yeah. Tried that and it made no diff. Never saw any tesitomonials on his site for gutsy, so maybe they're broken? Dunno.
2007-12-01T10:20:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	kelsin	I remove --purged my emacs. Added his repo. Added his key. Installed. And wammo, same ugly fonts. No errors, obviously used his package because I got the PPA warnings he mentioned...
2007-12-01T10:22:00.000Z	kelsin	ArthurArchnix	did you set the font and load in .Xresources like the page says
2007-12-01T10:23:00.000Z	kelsin	ArthurArchnix	or tried starting emacs with "emacs -fn 'Bitstream Vera Sans Mono'" or something?
2007-12-01T10:23:00.000Z	kelsin	ArthurArchnix	also make sure that emacs that is running is version 23, it's on the start screen
2007-12-01T10:24:00.000Z	kelsin	ArthurArchnix	if you do have two emacs installed you can select which one to use with sudo update-alternatives --config emacs
2007-12-02T04:50:00.000Z	kelsin	ArthurArchnix	gedit can edit python files with syntax highlighting, and both vi and emacs (the good text editors) have suport for python and have X versions
