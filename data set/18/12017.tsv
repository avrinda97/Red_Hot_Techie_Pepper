2007-03-18T07:53:00.000Z	john__		Does Ubuntu have a "Restore Point" feature?
2007-03-18T07:54:00.000Z	Pelo	john__	 I don't think so , but the install takes only 30 minutes so ...
2007-03-18T07:56:00.000Z	Pelo	john__	 you can make your home folder on a seperate partition,  this would enable you to reinstall from scratch without loosing your parameters and data
2007-03-18T07:57:00.000Z	Pelo	john__	 ubotu  is a bot
2007-08-05T10:28:00.000Z	Pelo	john__	welcome tothe madhouse
2007-08-05T10:30:00.000Z	Pelo	john__	 it's a lot of fun,  would you like a few starter links to get you going ?
2007-08-05T10:34:00.000Z	Pelo	john__	 sell support
2007-08-05T10:37:00.000Z	Pelo	john__	 you can make propriatary software to run on linux,  just know that what ever gpl stuffyou use as a basis needs to remain free,  the propriatary parts needs to be clean
2007-08-05T10:39:00.000Z	Pelo	john__	 how do you think redhat and canonical are making a buck ?
2007-08-05T10:40:00.000Z	Pelo	john__	 it's a bit of a busy channel here , with all the free support and all, we's appreicaite it
2007-08-05T10:50:00.000Z	Pelo	john__	 as long as the gpl stuff you use is still available and credited you can write your own stuff that works with it and keep it closed,  you can read the gpl 1 2 and 3 licences to see what the exact restrctitions are
2007-11-28T06:25:00.000Z	Pelo	john__	 do a search for the exact error msg in the forum , there is probably a detailed fix,  alternatively , consider running xubuntu if it is an older machine ,   www.ubuntuforums.org
2007-11-28T06:26:00.000Z	john__	Pelo	it isn't that old and the problem is really relating to xorg, it seems, not so much the display manager. I shouldn't have said gnome was working fine, since technically it isn't working at all.
2007-11-28T06:28:00.000Z	john__	Pelo	I searched the forum and no dice. I know what the problem is, what I really need to know is how to fix it. It seems xorg.conf is a bit messed up, but I can't remember for the life of me how to edit it from the shell.
2007-11-28T06:29:00.000Z	Pelo	john__	 I thinks thatyou get a question about that when you run  sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg , but I am not 100% sure, it's been a while
2007-11-28T06:30:00.000Z	Pelo	john__	 you can probably edit the fonts paths manualy in xorg.conf as well
2007-11-28T06:30:00.000Z	john__	Pelo	thanks SO MUCH that was another command I couldn't remember. I actually had this same error when I originally installed ubuntu and just forgot how to fix it
2007-11-28T06:31:00.000Z	Pelo	john__	 join me in #pelo
