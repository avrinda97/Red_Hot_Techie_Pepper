2009-10-09T18:49:00.000Z	cdavis		What is the screen shot tool that will allow you to draw a box around what you want to copy?
2009-10-09T18:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cdavis	theres a snapshot app that runs if you press print screen, you can change the option to be a region
2009-10-09T18:52:00.000Z	cdavis	ActionParsnip	What is the app name, my print screen button doesn't open a program that will allow a region selection
2009-10-09T18:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cdavis	joaopinto: its in accessories -> take screen shot
2010-03-25T18:56:00.000Z	cdavis	ActionParsnip	point taken, however this is to help co-workers and they want something a little less thought provoking
2010-03-25T18:58:00.000Z	cdavis	ActionParsnip	they want a web front end that asks questions about disasters, probabilities and impacts to determine what the policy needs to state.
2010-03-25T18:58:00.000Z	cdavis	ActionParsnip	I could, but they have told me I have other priorities :)
2010-08-14T19:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cdavis	openbox is very alive, its just not as "pretty" as the others but it uses a fraction of the resources
2010-08-14T19:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cdavis	http://openbox.org/wiki/Openbox:News
2010-08-14T19:13:00.000Z	cdavis	ActionParsnip	Is pypanel and netwmpager old or just not enough desire to have in the repos?
2010-08-14T19:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cdavis	submit it on http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com
2010-08-14T19:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cdavis	I found this: http://crunchbanglinux.org/wiki/netwmpager_howto
2011-04-28T20:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cdavis	do you mean the unity panel on the left or the top panel?
2011-04-28T20:46:00.000Z	cdavis	ActionParsnip	the top panel
2011-04-28T20:46:00.000Z	cdavis	ActionParsnip	I want to add Remminal to the top panel
2011-04-28T20:46:00.000Z	cdavis	ActionParsnip	s/Remminal/Remmina/
2011-04-28T20:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	cdavis	not sure, as far asa I've seen its not very changable, if you boot to the normal desktop and start unity then you may be able to add stuff
2011-04-28T20:49:00.000Z	cdavis	ActionParsnip	Thanks, I really liked having all of my rdesktop servers in one list. I will look for something else.
