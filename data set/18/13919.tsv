2008-06-27T17:00:00.000Z	dom		Hello, I have a problem with my Intel T5600 Dual Core CPU
2008-06-27T17:00:00.000Z	dom		both cores won't go over 1000Mhz even when they're both at 100%
2008-06-27T17:00:00.000Z	dom		not sure
2008-06-27T17:00:00.000Z	dom		one morge:
2008-06-27T17:01:00.000Z	dom		random processes start eating the entire cpu power
2008-06-27T17:01:00.000Z	dom		processes like vlc, or even deluge
2008-06-27T17:02:00.000Z	dom		any way to tell my cpu to use all of its power?
2008-06-27T17:02:00.000Z	dom		on windows, it worked fine
2008-06-27T17:03:00.000Z	soundray	dom	install cpuburn and run 'burnP6', it should bring it up
2008-06-27T17:12:00.000Z	soundray	dom	no success with burnP6 ?
2008-06-27T17:23:00.000Z	dom	soundray	what do you mean?
2008-06-27T17:21:00.000Z	soundray	dom	not a solution, just something to check
2008-06-27T17:21:00.000Z	soundray	dom	are you giving orders?
2008-06-27T17:24:00.000Z	soundray	dom	you don't seem to value my advice much (you forget my advice and my nick), and then you ask for help as if you had some entitlement
2008-06-27T17:26:00.000Z	soundray	dom	I was suggesting you run burnP6 from the cpuburn package, and see if that brings your frequency up
2008-06-27T17:30:00.000Z	soundray	dom	if that doesn't bring it up, I suspect that it's overheating
2008-06-27T17:35:00.000Z	dom	soundray	it went up to 1.3ghz for a couple of seconds, but then it went back to 1ghz, and overloaded on that
2008-06-27T18:18:00.000Z	soundray	dom	still here?
