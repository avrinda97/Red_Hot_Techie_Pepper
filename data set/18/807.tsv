2011-09-07T20:37:00.000Z	MeirD		Hello
2011-09-07T20:37:00.000Z	MeirD		I just installed Ubuntu on my laptop. I have a problem that often the computer gets very slow, and the windows in the OS (Terminal, Browser) start blinking with gray color
2011-09-07T20:38:00.000Z	MeirD		Is it a known issue?
2011-09-07T20:38:00.000Z	edbian	MeirD	That's just what the OS does when it is struggling with hardware constraints. What are the specs of this system?
2011-09-07T20:39:00.000Z	MeirD		it is an old laptop... HP Compaq 6720s
2011-09-07T20:39:00.000Z	MeirD		Hard Drive: 120GB SATA (5400RPM)
2011-09-07T20:39:00.000Z	MeirD		Processor: Intel Core 2 Duo Processor T5470 1.60GHz , 2MB L2 cache, 800MHz FS
2011-09-07T20:39:00.000Z	MeirD		Graphics: Intel Graphics Media Accelerator X3100
2011-09-07T20:40:00.000Z	MeirD		RAM: 1 x 1024MB DDR2 ... thats pretty much the specs
2011-09-07T20:40:00.000Z	MeirD		I installed the Ubuntu 11.04
2011-09-07T20:43:00.000Z	MeirD	edbian	Any ideas?
2011-09-07T20:43:00.000Z	edbian	MeirD	That should be enough for Ubuntu.  Can you elaborate on what you're doing when the windows go grey?
2011-09-07T20:44:00.000Z	MeirD		nothing special... only the terminal window and a browser are open
2011-09-07T20:44:00.000Z	MeirD		Sometimes Aptana Studio too... but that's about it
2011-09-07T20:44:00.000Z	edbian	MeirD	next time it happens run top in the terminal and see what is using the most CPU or the most RAM
2011-09-07T20:45:00.000Z	MeirD		ok, I started "top" I'll check whats going on there
2011-09-07T20:46:00.000Z	MeirD		command "Xorg"
2011-09-07T20:47:00.000Z	edbian	MeirD	Xorg draws the graphics.  I suggest changing your graphics driver.  Unfortunately I don't know how and I have to go now
