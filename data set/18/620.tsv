2011-11-27T03:41:00.000Z	DrSlony		What the hell is wrong with Ubuntu iso servers? No only do they cut me off 2-5% into the download, but wget --trust-server-names http://www.ubuntu.com/start-download?distro=desktop&bits=64&release=latest also downloads to ubuntu-11.10-desktop-i386.iso which is what the 32 bit one should download to.
2011-11-27T03:42:00.000Z	Scott_S	DrSlony	It is always highly recommended to use the torrent downloads, as it decreases load on the servers.
2011-11-27T03:42:00.000Z	DrSlony	Scott_S	ok but thats not the point.
2011-11-27T03:43:00.000Z	Scott_S	DrSlony	Load on the servers can cause that issue. To be honest, it's either a problem with your connection, or an overload on their servers. I know I never get over 3Mbps on their direct downloads.
2011-11-27T03:43:00.000Z	DrSlony	Scott_S	no its got nothing to do with my connection
2011-11-27T03:43:00.000Z	DrSlony		i get almost 6Mbps as I should
2011-11-27T03:43:00.000Z	Scott_S	DrSlony	http://releases.ubuntu.com/11.10/ubuntu-11.10-desktop-i386.iso.torrent
2011-11-27T03:43:00.000Z	DrSlony		until it cuts me off
2011-11-27T03:44:00.000Z	DrSlony		ah, good point!
2011-11-27T03:44:00.000Z	DrSlony		:]
2011-11-27T03:45:00.000Z	DrSlony		second complaint was my fault
2011-11-27T03:46:00.000Z	Scott_S	DrSlony	The only thing I can think of is server load. I personally never use direct downloads and so haven't had that issue for a long time.
2011-11-27T03:46:00.000Z	DrSlony	Scott_S	third time lucky
2011-11-27T03:49:00.000Z	DrSlony		I need to compile my program to work in all sorts of ubuntu versions, is this possible without installing each version in a vm?
2011-11-27T03:50:00.000Z	Scott_S	DrSlony	I am unsure of how to create a .deb installer from a compiled source, however let me do a quick search and I'll return findings asap.
2011-11-27T03:52:00.000Z	Scott_S	DrSlony	Is this what you're looking to do? http://www.webupd8.org/2010/01/how-to-create-deb-package-ubuntu-debian.html
2011-11-27T03:52:00.000Z	DrSlony	Scott_S	very nice of you :] i can google too, but it would be better if an ubuntu user suggests some best-course-of-action, as a non-ubuntu user i wont know if what i find is the optimal way
2011-11-27T03:52:00.000Z	Scott_S	DrSlony	I personally do use Ubuntu, however I don't have an extremely wide range of knowledge, I just know the basic things and know what to search for. =P
