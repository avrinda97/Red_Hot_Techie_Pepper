2005-03-22T07:31:00.000Z	hazmat	knucks	yes, i use it with ubuntu sa well
2005-03-22T07:31:00.000Z	knucks	hazmat	how did u set it up?
2005-03-22T07:31:00.000Z	hazmat	knucks	firewire, sbp2 module, and gtkpod
2005-03-22T07:32:00.000Z	hazmat	knucks	basically i plugged it in and it mostly works, i had to manually mount it
2005-03-22T07:32:00.000Z	knucks	hazmat	can you run nme through that?
2005-03-22T07:32:00.000Z	hazmat	knucks	sure
2005-03-22T07:33:00.000Z	hazmat	knucks	are you connecting via firewire?
2005-03-22T07:33:00.000Z	hazmat	knucks	is it a recent ipod make? ie what generation?
2005-03-22T07:33:00.000Z	hazmat	knucks	the old windows ones were formatted differently
2005-03-22T07:33:00.000Z	hazmat	knucks	have you used it with a mac ?
2005-03-22T07:35:00.000Z	hazmat	knucks	hmm... your probably best off looking at the gtkpod.sf.net docs or googling linux ipod... mine and most new ones are formatted hfs+ but if you have an fat formatted ipod there are differences
2005-03-22T07:35:00.000Z	hazmat	knucks	on hoary, all i did was plug it in.. no manual work required.. it just pops up on the desktop
2005-03-22T07:36:00.000Z	hazmat	knucks	try a dmesg and see what kinda of output you get.. i used to manually mount and have this entry in /etc/fstab /dev/sda       /media/firewire0 hfsplus defaults,noauto,user       0      0
2005-03-22T07:37:00.000Z	knucks	hazmat	what should i look for?
2005-03-22T07:41:00.000Z	hazmat	knucks	any connection of new device event
2005-03-22T07:42:00.000Z	hazmat	knucks	and or a loading of the firewire sbp2 and scsi modules or the usb mass storage device module (if using usb)
2005-03-22T07:42:00.000Z	hazmat	knucks	modprobe sbp2
