2008-06-13T12:01:00.000Z	ylmson		hii... does anyone know how to properly blacklist ssb module for hardy?
2008-06-13T12:02:00.000Z	ylmson		my ndiswrapper wouldn't work with ssb, but for some reason, even if I delete the ssb.ko from /lib/modules/###, it *still* loads during boot!
2008-06-13T12:02:00.000Z	ylmson		o.o
2008-06-13T12:02:00.000Z	ylmson		I did
2008-06-13T12:02:00.000Z	ylmson		but ssb is loading itself everyboot regardless
2008-06-13T12:02:00.000Z	ylmson		I'm dumbfounded
2008-06-13T12:03:00.000Z	ylmson		and what's more, there is only one ssb.ko now, that's in my home directory
2008-06-13T12:03:00.000Z	ylmson		I did a locate
2008-06-13T12:03:00.000Z	ylmson		but it *still* manages to load it. O.o
2008-06-13T12:04:00.000Z	glitsj16	ylmson	seems like somthing in /etc/init.d is starting it on boot .. what is ssb btw ?
2008-06-13T12:05:00.000Z	ylmson		what's even more funny, modprobe ssb already shows: "Module ssb not found"
2008-06-13T12:05:00.000Z	ylmson		but somehow it finds it during boot
2008-06-13T12:05:00.000Z	ylmson		I can't believe this
2008-06-13T12:07:00.000Z	ylmson	glitsj16	ssb is something that conflicts with ndiswrapper
2008-06-13T12:11:00.000Z	ylmson		noooo way
2008-06-13T12:11:00.000Z	ylmson		ssb is still here!
2008-06-13T12:11:00.000Z	ylmson		I deleted the freaking ko file :/
2008-06-13T12:12:00.000Z	glitsj16	ylmson	have you tried any of the proposed fixes mentioned at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/bcm43xx/Feisty_No-Fluff#head-cbc75fcb762da2057fa8dbe904358e4b611353c0 ?
