2011-06-03T00:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Nixot: use a symlink to fool the OS
2011-06-03T00:22:00.000Z	nixot	ActionParsnip	how do I do that? (sorry for my ignorance)
2011-06-03T00:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bibliotheque	its a great repo with games and apps
2011-06-03T00:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Nixot: find the file then make a symlink in the same folder with the new name. If you can give the full path to the file you have, i can give the command
2011-06-03T00:26:00.000Z	nixot		But the problem is it's libavutil.so.50 that it has installed, not libavutil.so.49
2011-06-03T00:26:00.000Z	nixot		oooohhh I get it
2011-06-03T00:26:00.000Z	nixot		where would it be
2011-06-03T00:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Nixot: so you have 50 and need 49?
2011-06-03T00:27:00.000Z	nixot		Yeah, so make a sym-link in the program's folder called libavutil.so.49
2011-06-03T00:27:00.000Z	nixot		But where would it be? hmm
2011-06-03T00:27:00.000Z	nixot		looking in /usr/share...
2011-06-03T00:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Nixot: do you see it in /usr/lib ?
2011-06-03T00:29:00.000Z	nixot		Hmm, how do you make a symlink from one place to another without clicking "Make link"? Because it is grey.
2011-06-03T00:30:00.000Z	nixot	ActionParsnip	I found the lib file in /usr/lib!
2011-06-03T00:30:00.000Z	nixot		Can you shift+drag, or alt+drag or something to make a symbolic link somewhere?
2011-06-03T00:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Nixot: sudo ln -s /usr/lib/libavutil.50 /usr/lib/libavutil.49
2011-06-03T00:34:00.000Z	nixot	ActionParsnip	it says the link is broken when I look at it in jnautilus.
