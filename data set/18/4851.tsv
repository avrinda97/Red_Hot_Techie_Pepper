2009-02-04T05:57:00.000Z	vock		Okay, so got the Windows computer nad the Ubuntu computer pinging each other, samba server running, and the ubuntu computer has been connected to by XBMC before and still works, how do you get the windows computer to see the samba share? Tried just doing \\linuxboxip\sharedfolder, and it says it can't find it
2009-02-04T05:57:00.000Z	laughyn1nj4	vock	you running xp or vista?
2009-02-04T05:57:00.000Z	vock	laughyn1nj4	running xp
2009-02-04T05:58:00.000Z	vock	laughyn1nj4	sp3
2009-02-04T05:59:00.000Z	vock	laughyn1nj4	the computer name is Ubuntu, workgroup is Abode and shared folder is the \media folder
2009-02-04T06:00:00.000Z	laughyn1nj4	vock	then try \\linuxbox\shareNAME
2009-02-04T06:00:00.000Z	laughyn1nj4	vock	samba lets you name the share regardless of what the actual folder name is ... it's that name you need to look for in your nw resources on the windows box
2009-02-04T06:02:00.000Z	vock	laughyn1nj4	made the share name media to point to the media directory, still can't see it
2009-02-04T06:03:00.000Z	laughyn1nj4	vock	have you opened "my network places"
2009-02-04T06:03:00.000Z	vock	laughyn1nj4	yeah, it's empty
2009-02-04T06:03:00.000Z	laughyn1nj4	vock	it could be a firewall setting on the ubuntu machine ... are you useing 'firestarter' by chance?
2009-02-04T06:04:00.000Z	vock	laughyn1nj4	yeah, have firestarter
2009-02-04T06:06:00.000Z	vock	laughyn1nj4	yeah, that IP is allowed, but it's not working still :(
2009-02-04T06:06:00.000Z	laughyn1nj4	vock	what are you using to config the samba server?  are you just editing the file manually?
2009-02-04T06:07:00.000Z	vock	laughyn1nj4	yeah, manually configured it, and the windows IP is on the IP allowed list
2009-02-04T06:09:00.000Z	vock	laughyn1nj4	I have guests ok on all the shared folders too,
2009-02-04T06:10:00.000Z	vock	laughyn1nj4	what web-interface do you use? Maybe i can try that if it's a bit easier to configure and compare the files?
2009-02-04T06:10:00.000Z	laughyn1nj4	vock	i pm'd you
