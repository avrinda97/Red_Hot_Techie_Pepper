2011-04-19T07:21:00.000Z	kontagious		does anyone know the release date of the new flash player that works with 64 bit ubuntu
2011-04-19T07:22:00.000Z	ohsix	kontagious	i don't know of any release date; but there have been 2 beta versions "Square" and another one available
2011-04-19T07:22:00.000Z	kontagious	ohsix	the beta version is so unstable. have you got it to work reliably?
2011-04-19T07:23:00.000Z	ohsix	kontagious	i've had no problem at all actually
2011-04-19T07:24:00.000Z	kontagious	ohsix	if i run 2 embeds from different sites it crashes firefox. there are other things but they slip my mind right now
2011-04-19T07:25:00.000Z	ohsix	kontagious	what extensions are you using?
2011-04-19T07:25:00.000Z	kontagious	ohsix	adblock, gmail watcher, stumble upon, ubuntu firefox mod
2011-04-19T07:26:00.000Z	ohsix	kontagious	adblock or adblock plus?
2011-04-19T07:26:00.000Z	kontagious	ohsix	plus
2011-04-19T07:27:00.000Z	ohsix	kontagious	are you using r162? (check in about:plugins)
2011-04-19T07:28:00.000Z	kontagious	ohsix	Shockwave Flash 10.2 r159
2011-04-19T07:29:00.000Z	ohsix	kontagious	ah, get 10.3 162
2011-04-19T07:30:00.000Z	kontagious	ohsix	thanks, that seems logical. too bad for no auto updates
2011-04-19T07:30:00.000Z	ohsix	kontagious	http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/flashplayer10/square/
2011-04-19T07:30:00.000Z	ohsix	kontagious	yea it's a tradeoff, theres a ppa that has it packaged somewhere but i'd recommend just staying on top of it
2011-04-19T07:31:00.000Z	ohsix	kontagious	i used the version you are using for a while, though; don't recall any particular problems, i had used intel graphics with xorg-edgers (up to date by week) and the gpu override
2011-04-19T07:31:00.000Z	kontagious	ohsix	should i uninstall the flash plugin and install or overwrite
2011-04-19T07:37:00.000Z	kontagious	ohsix	thanks for the tip i think it might work. ill have to try after this stream
