2006-04-15T13:09:00.000Z	alex_	erUSUL	i dont see .fonts
2006-04-15T13:10:00.000Z	alex_	erUSUL	bash: cd: /home/alex/.fonts/: No such file or directory
2006-04-15T13:10:00.000Z	erUSUL	alex_	the system wide fonts folder is locked to normal users so they do not mess up the system
2006-04-15T13:11:00.000Z	alex_	erUSUL	bash: cd: /home/alex/.fonts/: No such file or directory <-- is that normal.
2006-04-15T13:11:00.000Z	erUSUL	alex_	yes it is normal. i have one because i created it
2006-04-15T13:12:00.000Z	alex_	erUSUL	- so what's wrong then?
2006-04-15T13:13:00.000Z	erUSUL	alex_	i can not know for sure.look for errors in the logs (less /var/log/Xorg.0.log)
