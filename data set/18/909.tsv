2011-11-06T21:29:00.000Z	spot_		because grub is broken
2011-11-06T21:29:00.000Z	spot_		and it doesent let me to open ubuntu or windows xp
2011-11-06T21:29:00.000Z	spot_		and when i'm tring a windows xp cd i get a black screen when the system boots up, i get the "Press any key to boot from CD..." prompt, you press any key, i see for a brief moment, "Setup is inspecting your hardware configuration" and then the screen goes black
2011-11-06T21:30:00.000Z	spot_		i think if i format the partition with linux it would work
2011-11-06T21:30:00.000Z	spot_		i tried to fix the grub but no success
2011-11-06T21:31:00.000Z	spot_		how can i fix my windows?
2011-11-06T21:31:00.000Z	spot_		i cant use any windows cd !
2011-11-06T21:31:00.000Z	spot_		because i got a BLACK SCREEN
2011-11-06T21:31:00.000Z	spot_		this is the GRUB foult
2011-11-06T21:33:00.000Z	spot_		grub should allow me to boot from windows or ubuntu , IT DOESENT
2011-11-06T21:33:00.000Z	auronandace	spot_	also installing windows afer linux overwrites grub (on the mbr)
2011-11-06T21:38:00.000Z	auronandace	spot_	because it isn't a grub or ubuntu issue (if you can't boot a windows cd ask for help in ##windows)
2011-11-06T21:43:00.000Z	auronandace	spot_	how is formatting a partition going to help you boot a windows cd?
2011-11-06T21:44:00.000Z	auronandace	spot_	then backup your data
2011-11-06T21:48:00.000Z	auronandace	spot_	did you press apply?
2011-11-06T21:49:00.000Z	auronandace	spot_	show me a screenshot
2011-11-06T22:00:00.000Z	auronandace	spot_	do you understand what is meant when you say format? do you want to make it blank space or a different partition type (ext4, ntfs, fat32)
2011-11-06T22:01:00.000Z	auronandace	spot_	then based on that screenshot you've likely formatted the ext4 partition, if you want to boot ubuntu, you'll need to install it there
