2007-03-28T07:17:00.000Z	shirish		ok any experts here who have done work with 915resolution driver/tool?
2007-03-28T07:18:00.000Z	GionnyBoss	shirish	I'm not so expert, but I did my laptop work with 915 resolution
2007-03-28T07:18:00.000Z	GionnyBoss	shirish	what's exactly your problem?
2007-03-28T07:20:00.000Z	GionnyBoss	shirish	restart in safe mode (it's one of the option in GRUB when you start your computer). Then from the terminal, try to configure correctly 915resolution and xorg.conf
2007-03-28T07:22:00.000Z	GionnyBoss	shirish	for grub configuration ->    sudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst
2007-03-28T07:22:00.000Z	shirish	GionnyBoss	srry for mistyping ur name
2007-03-28T07:22:00.000Z	GionnyBoss	shirish	I don't know that, you can try to search. I have 10 seconds and it's good for me
2007-03-28T07:26:00.000Z	shirish	GionnyBoss	 ok lemme first explain the mistake I did while configuring 915resolution
2007-03-28T07:26:00.000Z	shirish	GionnyBoss	instead of using a mode which I didn't want to use, I mentioned the mode which I wanted to use
2007-03-28T07:27:00.000Z	shirish	GionnyBoss	later on, although I got the hang & mentioned instead the mode I didn't want to use, what should I do?
2007-03-28T07:29:00.000Z	GionnyBoss	shirish	what I did is to search for 915resolution modes to find my resolution (that 4c or things like that). Then I configured 915resolution (there is a configuration file I don't remember where, but I can chek) to use that mode (4c or whatever) that I want to use with resolution 640x480. Then I edited file /etc/X11/xorg.conf and set as resolution only 640x480, 24 bit.
2007-03-28T07:30:00.000Z	shirish	GionnyBoss	the configuration file is at /etc/default/915resolution
2007-03-28T07:30:00.000Z	shirish	GionnyBoss	I did tht one, then I also the /etc/init.d/915resolution start
2007-03-28T07:31:00.000Z	GionnyBoss	shirish	yeah that one. It could be a good thing to install "BUM" (BootUp Manager) to check that 915resolution is always booted with a high priority (before gmd and graphic server). BUM it's a good gui program
2007-03-28T07:32:00.000Z	shirish	GionnyBoss	BUM is in universe, multiverse or some other repository?
2007-03-28T07:32:00.000Z	GionnyBoss	shirish	boot in safe mode and try to do what I told you... change that 915resolution config file and change /etc/X11/xorg.conf to use only one resolution, the one in 915resolution config file
2007-03-28T07:33:00.000Z	GionnyBoss	shirish	I don't remember, just check. I think it's in the normal repo. Just try to reboot in safe mode, change those 2 files (915resolution and xorg.conf) and then try a 'startx' to start the x server and check that it starts in the correct way. If so, install BUM and ensure that 915resolution is booted, possibly before other processes
2007-03-28T08:57:00.000Z	shirish	GionnyBoss	u still here?
