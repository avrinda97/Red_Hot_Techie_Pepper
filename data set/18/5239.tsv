2010-11-12T02:57:00.000Z	pepee		sudo /etc/init.d/ssh stop won't work
2010-11-12T02:57:00.000Z	pepee		same as killall -9

2010-11-12T02:57:00.000Z	pepee		*just
2010-11-12T02:58:00.000Z	maginot	pepee	pkill and killall -9 isn't the same.
2010-11-12T02:59:00.000Z	pepee	maginot	well it's not working
2010-11-12T02:59:00.000Z	maginot	pepee	I doubt it's not working. I believe you are doing wrong, like no being root
2010-11-12T03:01:00.000Z	maginot	pepee	what is the output of "ps aux | grep -i ssh" ?
2010-11-12T03:01:00.000Z	pepee	maginot	  root      5941  0.0  0.0  49312  1128 ?        Ss   18:59   0:00 /usr/sbin/sshd
2010-11-12T03:02:00.000Z	maginot	pepee	try kill -9 5941
2010-11-12T03:03:00.000Z	pepee	maginot	I already did that, the daemon is just restarted
2010-11-12T03:03:00.000Z	maginot	pepee	this must be thing of upstart
2010-11-12T03:04:00.000Z	maginot	pepee	=)
2010-11-12T03:05:00.000Z	maginot	pepee	this is "always" problem, lol
2010-11-12T03:05:00.000Z	maginot	pepee	well, I don't know about ubuntu, but on my distro I build the kernel with suspend2 (old tux on ice) and works pretty good =)
2010-11-12T03:06:00.000Z	maginot	pepee	that is possible,  I only use ndvidia =/
