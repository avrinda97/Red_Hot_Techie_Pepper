2012-01-14T08:56:00.000Z	Demonstrate		it's not
2012-01-14T08:56:00.000Z	Demonstrate		Bootcamp, is entirely diffrent.

2012-01-14T08:59:00.000Z	Demonstrate		Oh, well then yes, Wine is a program inside Linux, that emulates the windows API so things can run on linux
2012-01-14T08:59:00.000Z	Demonstrate		the reason windows apps cant run in unix are because they are windows API specific or have windows specific resources (dlls' etc)
2012-01-14T08:59:00.000Z	Demonstrate		WINE reemulates the C drive and registry
2012-01-14T09:00:00.000Z	Demonstrate		and you can even make things work under wine by adding resources yourself.
2012-01-14T09:01:00.000Z	Demonstrate		I manually compiled my ubuntu source, just cuz im a nerd like that ;)
2012-01-14T09:01:00.000Z	Gerald_	Demonstrate	if i change a kernel related file like: http://www.mjmwired.net/kernel/Documentation/usb/acm.txt ... how can i recompile this specific part? need help :D
2012-01-14T09:02:00.000Z	Demonstrate	Gerald_	what are you trying to accomplish ;O/
2012-01-14T09:03:00.000Z	Demonstrate	Gerald_	are you completely at a bust?
2012-01-14T09:05:00.000Z	Gerald_	Demonstrate	i need to change those file...and compile the kernel that the change will be effective???
2012-01-14T09:06:00.000Z	Gerald_	Demonstrate	according to this: http://groups.google.com/group/ti-launchpad/browse_frm/thread/e414bf066fbd1d59/1dacabc8a4f00ab6#1dacabc8a4f00ab6
2012-01-14T09:06:00.000Z	Demonstrate	Gerald_	if you've made the changes to the files, compile the kernel and they should be a part of the kernels resources.
2012-01-14T09:07:00.000Z	Gerald_	Demonstrate	but how can i only compile this specific part in the kernel?
