2006-11-16T07:49:00.000Z	tbf		uh.... uh... uh.... what can i do for blocking this stupid "single close button" part of this tabconsistency spec? (https://features.launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+spec/tab-consistency)
2006-11-16T07:49:00.000Z	tbf		or isn't it possible as mark is backing it?
2006-11-16T07:50:00.000Z	webben	tbf	why is it so problematic?
2006-11-16T07:52:00.000Z	tbf	webben	'cause it detatches the action from the object, cause it forces me to use the mouse for long distances and more importantly cause i've use that interface regulary caused me to close too much tabs accidently in firefox 1.5 and visual studio 2003
2006-11-16T07:55:00.000Z	webben	tbf	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/TabConsistency says commentary is needing from accessibility community
2006-11-16T07:56:00.000Z	webben	tbf	looks like you could just add a comment at the end there
2006-11-16T07:56:00.000Z	webben	tbf	I recommend being as detailed as possible though; and if possible suggest alternate solutions
2006-11-16T07:58:00.000Z	webben	tbf	Note that according to Mark, they keep getting reports of accidental closures with a close button on each tab.
2006-11-16T07:58:00.000Z	webben	tbf	It may be /fewer/ people have closure problems with a single close tab button.
2006-11-16T07:59:00.000Z	tbf	webben	well, guess someone should make a usuablity study on that issue then
2006-11-16T07:59:00.000Z	webben	tbf	Note the reference to some Google study at the end
2006-11-16T07:59:00.000Z	webben	tbf	you might try and find that
2006-11-16T08:00:00.000Z	tbf	webben	well, but as i also meet _few_ people having problems with the single button behaviour, it might be, that there a just two kinds of people
2006-11-16T08:00:00.000Z	webben	tbf	Well, yeah, but I assume Mark is referring to a differing quantity of user feedback. Perhaps you should argue it needs to be user configurable one way or the other.
2006-11-16T08:01:00.000Z	webben	tbf	the key idea is to have a consistent interface
2006-11-16T08:02:00.000Z	webben	tbf	or maybe just how good their mouse control is?
2006-11-16T08:02:00.000Z	webben	tbf	or what they're used to
2006-11-16T08:02:00.000Z	webben	tbf	lots of possible reasons
