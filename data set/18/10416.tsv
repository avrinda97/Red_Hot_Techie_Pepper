2006-12-13T06:38:00.000Z	avis		will gparted resize reiserfs ok ??
2006-12-13T06:39:00.000Z	avis		you can be ok with 40 gigs but still low on space.
2006-12-13T06:40:00.000Z	avis		i always triple my memory for swap
2006-12-13T06:40:00.000Z	avis		as per LPI instructions
2006-12-13T06:40:00.000Z	avis		but double works
2006-12-13T06:41:00.000Z	avis		he would probably be ok with 3.5 GIGS
2006-12-13T06:41:00.000Z	KillerT	avis	why so much?
2006-12-13T06:43:00.000Z	KillerT	avis	and why do u say it depends where linux is installed
2006-12-13T06:44:00.000Z	avis	KillerT	i said it doesn't matter where linux is on the hard drive
2006-12-13T06:45:00.000Z	KillerT	avis	i know there is a way (with large amounts of ram) to run linux without swap so doubling it when u have a gig of ram i don't think is neccessary anymore is the course outdated
2006-12-13T06:47:00.000Z	KillerT	avis	because swap uses the hard drive as ram and it is slower r/w access u would do better not having it
2006-12-13T06:50:00.000Z	KillerT	avis	has "connections"
2006-12-13T06:51:00.000Z	KillerT	avis	outdated hardware yet u have memory u can drop
2006-12-13T06:52:00.000Z	avis	KillerT	what is your point ?  if i have spare memory i want to donate to ubuntu developers why does that matter so much to you ?
2006-12-13T06:52:00.000Z	KillerT	avis	r u running outdated hardware or u just saying u have outdated hardware to sell
2006-12-13T06:54:00.000Z	KillerT	avis	u said u had outdated hardware yet u said u were giving away ddr400 to developers so i was thinking why would he run outdated hardware and give away ddr400?
2006-12-13T07:03:00.000Z	avis	KillerT	i was asking thoreauputic
2006-12-13T07:03:00.000Z	KillerT	avis	relax man
