2009-03-26T19:23:00.000Z	HammerHead66	anom1	do you know how that happened your drives?
2009-03-26T19:23:00.000Z	anom1	HammerHead66	I can't be certain until I format /dev/sdb. However, I do receive error msgs: "GRUB error 25", and "fsck.ext2: Superblock invalid, trying backup blocks", and so forth. Even Tiny Core Linux doesn't boot properly.
2009-03-26T19:25:00.000Z	anom1	HammerHead66	I'm just wondering if there's a way of accessing file data without the superblock.
2009-03-26T19:26:00.000Z	anom1	HammerHead66	Maybe I should make full use of my google-fu and try to research the answer by myself?
2009-03-26T19:26:00.000Z	HammerHead66		﻿anom1: I'm checking now
2009-03-26T19:29:00.000Z	anom1	HammerHead66	I think other people needs help more. I'll google some more for solutions. Thanks for your attention.
2009-03-26T19:30:00.000Z	HammerHead66		﻿Jimi: it might be if that laptop is connected anywhere on the net it would back up the file to it automatically...but I don't know for sure.
2009-03-26T19:32:00.000Z	HammerHead66		﻿anom1: 25: "Unrecognized command" This error is returned if an unrecognized command is entered into the command-line or in a boot sequence section of a config file and that entry is selected.

2009-03-26T19:33:00.000Z	anom1	HammerHead66	Thank you. Actually I think my /dev/sdb drive may be failing, I'll format it to find out more.
