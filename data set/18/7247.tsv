2008-01-17T11:25:00.000Z	GothicProphet		Anyone around that can help me with setting up a dual-boot Ubuntu 7.10 & Vista?
2008-01-17T11:26:00.000Z	badkitty	GothicProphet	Just make sure you partition the space before you install to make it easy on yourself
2008-01-17T11:27:00.000Z	GothicProphet	badkitty	the install has the option to do that right?  Or do I need to use a separate utility?
2008-01-17T11:27:00.000Z	badkitty	GothicProphet	Well.. do you have your Vista installed already?
2008-01-17T11:28:00.000Z	badkitty	GothicProphet	Do you know if you have free space on your hdd?
2008-01-17T11:29:00.000Z	badkitty	GothicProphet	well I mean unused and unpartitioned space
2008-01-17T11:29:00.000Z	GothicProphet	badkitty	It should, like I said, Vista was just fresh installed (reformat prior to reinstall)
2008-01-17T11:32:00.000Z	badkitty	GothicProphet	Ok well then yes, you just throw in the LIVECD, boot it up (making sure your CDROM is first to boot) then click install and make sure you guide it through (so it doesn't erase your vista partition)
2008-01-17T11:33:00.000Z	GothicProphet	badkitty	thanks... I messed that up last time I tried a dual boot (an xp machine) so it's now a pure ubuntu comp.  LOL
2008-01-17T11:45:00.000Z	badkitty	GothicProphet	LOL
