2010-01-20T08:07:00.000Z	usrv		ok ubuntu geniuses, I've got a challenge for you. "/dev/sdc is apparently in use by the system; will not make a filesystem here!" but it's not mounted or in use
2010-01-20T08:08:00.000Z	guest	usrv	cat /proc/mounts     or even   df
2010-01-20T08:14:00.000Z	usrv	guest	kmin: I can't even mkfs.ext4 -F
2010-01-20T08:17:00.000Z	guest	usrv	blkid | grep 555a147b-f0f0-4623-9390-db7abc1b60d3
2010-01-20T08:18:00.000Z	usrv	guest	sde1. that's the drive my system is installed on
2010-01-20T08:19:00.000Z	guest	usrv	then i don't see why an   sudo eject /dev/sd?    wont work.
2010-01-20T08:20:00.000Z	usrv	guest	*******@*******:~$ sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdc1
2010-01-20T08:21:00.000Z	guest	usrv	hmmmm    sudo fdisk -l    and see if the system even recgnizes an sdc
2010-01-20T08:22:00.000Z	usrv	guest	it does
2010-01-20T08:24:00.000Z	guest	usrv	and scd1 is where the system lives ?
2010-01-20T08:24:00.000Z	usrv	guest	this problem started yesterday. I took the drive out and did a full format overnight in windows and it worked fine
2010-01-20T08:24:00.000Z	usrv	guest	no, sde1
2010-01-20T08:26:00.000Z	usrv	guest	here's a question. this motherboard is new. would ubuntu have issues with me setting my sata controller to AHCI?
2010-01-20T08:26:00.000Z	guest	usrv	very possable.
2010-01-20T08:26:00.000Z	usrv	guest	i don't get it tho because it sees the drives and lets me partition them
2010-01-20T08:28:00.000Z	guest	usrv	let me hand you off to someone that has had some experance with this sort of issue.   all my hardware is older stuff.  and i really don't know what else to do there.
2010-01-20T08:29:00.000Z	usrv	guest	ok thanks a lot. do you know someone in particular or just anybody reading along?
2010-01-20T08:29:00.000Z	usrv	guest	ok. thanks for the assist.
