2011-12-07T09:05:00.000Z	mbeierl		another question: I enabled compiz/desktop cube with unity integration and now I don't know how to get workspace switcher to show up.  Is there one for unity?
2011-12-07T09:06:00.000Z	dr_willis	mbeierl	best to forget the cube. it and unuty dont play nicely
2011-12-07T09:07:00.000Z	mbeierl	dr_willis	but... but.. I'm a cube addict :(
2011-12-07T09:09:00.000Z	dr_willis	mbeierl	 cube gas gone the way of bellbottom pants.....
2011-12-07T09:10:00.000Z	mbeierl	dr_willis	but... I LIKE bell bottoms.  They fit over my boots
2012-01-04T23:15:00.000Z	dr_willis	mbeierl	 you could try ddrescue -  this is a data disk? or a movie disk? comercial disk?
2012-01-04T23:15:00.000Z	mbeierl	dr_willis	commercial movie dvd.  I just get: Sense: Medium format corrupted
2012-01-04T23:16:00.000Z	dr_willis	mbeierl	 Hmm.. wonder if there could be some little scratch/curruption on the disk thats hard to see
2012-01-04T23:16:00.000Z	mbeierl	dr_willis	that's what I would guess
2012-01-04T23:17:00.000Z	mbeierl	dr_willis	it just seems like a weak point in DVD layouts that if the superblock (or whatever) is damaged, the whole disk appears unusable
2012-01-04T23:26:00.000Z	mbeierl	dr_willis	alas, ddrescue thinks it is reading bad blocks from the disk, but the disk is not even spinning.  It seems that once the dvd drive itself decides it cannot read the disk, no further operations will work.
2012-01-04T23:26:00.000Z	dr_willis	mbeierl	 bummer.
2012-01-04T23:26:00.000Z	mbeierl	dr_willis	yep.  thanks anyways.
2012-01-04T23:27:00.000Z	dr_willis	mbeierl	 but the disk used to work? weird. Not one of those old self-destucting dvd movies they tried to come out with like 5+ yrs ago is it?
2012-01-04T23:27:00.000Z	mbeierl	dr_willis	nope.  it's a two-part disk.  Disk 1 won't load, but disk 2 does.  go figure
2012-01-04T23:28:00.000Z	mbeierl	dr_willis	I mean, yes it used to work, and no, it's not supposed to be self-destructing
2012-01-04T23:28:00.000Z	dr_willis	mbeierl	I got a dvd movie once that was upside down.. lable was on the data side. :)
2012-01-04T23:29:00.000Z	mbeierl	dr_willis	nice. no, I can confirm this is a movie that used to work
