2006-12-22T11:14:00.000Z	Acu		HELP: I want to buy a Desktop and Laptop (Preferably with AMD X2) without OS or with Linux - so far what I found was $200 more expensive if you get it without  than if you buy it with windows - is puzzling - anyhow maybe someone have some good hints - I really appreciate anyhelp
2006-12-22T11:16:00.000Z	holycow	Acu	build the desktop your self, you never really want to buy a name brand.  they will put whatever parts they want randomly into them so name brand boxes are useless
2006-12-22T11:16:00.000Z	holycow	Acu	for laptops stick with all intel chipsets and video as well.  asus sells laptops in kits as well that you can put together i can get you a link
2006-12-22T11:19:00.000Z	Acu	holycow	I used to build workstations - nowadays if you have no "dealer price" you end up paying 20% more for the hardware - but I am willing to look at - let me follow this linuxcertified - so far were outrageusly expensive
2006-12-22T11:19:00.000Z	holycow	Acu	the point is, if you look at the price of a barebone laptops, that is as cheap as you will get with laptops ... any EXACT SAME win laptop will cost 100 bucks more at least so you save right there
2006-12-22T11:19:00.000Z	holycow	Acu	not true
2006-12-22T11:19:00.000Z	holycow	Acu	i am a reseller, dealers don't make shit on components
2006-12-22T11:20:00.000Z	holycow	Acu	we are actually starting to buy retail ... paying 8% markup is really not worth the time going through the signup process for becoming a reseller
2006-12-22T11:27:00.000Z	Acu	holycow	can you give me other laptop barebone site because the http://anitec.ca/product/6736/asus_z96js_intel_945pm_core_duo_barebone_notebook_*free_2nd_year_warranty_upgrade*/  is far more expensive than if you just buy the laptop full featured at hp or dell ?
2006-12-22T11:28:00.000Z	holycow	Acu	no
2006-12-22T11:28:00.000Z	holycow	Acu	all i can tell you is that what you are looking for.  you need to search for the rest
2006-12-22T11:32:00.000Z	holycow	Acu	then you really are in the wrong place unfortunately
2006-12-22T11:32:00.000Z	holycow	Acu	you should just stick with windows
2006-12-22T11:35:00.000Z	holycow	Acu	actually thats wrong
2006-12-22T11:35:00.000Z	Acu	holycow	100 percent pay their dues  to Microsoft ?
2006-12-22T11:39:00.000Z	holycow	Acu	its not a paradox, you just don't know how to compare laptops properly
2006-12-22T11:43:00.000Z	Acu	holycow	I do not think you need to be a genius to compare to laptops - there are only 14 or so features which determine the performance (and price) - I was talking of similar features - do not get me wrong - I use a Pentium 4 laptop and a pentium 4 desktop runing Debian and two powerpc runing ubuntu - but for all of those I have paid the microsoft and mcintosh the OS - even I do not use it - I really want to buy a laptop and a desktop but real
2006-12-22T11:52:00.000Z	Acu	holycow	VMT2007 and MusicShuffle - thanks for your input - but we should ask ourselves from 823 people in this chat how many we have paid microsoft ? And maybe multiple times. --- We have to end here this discussion but I really think it stinks that we cannot buy easy computers with Linux or without OS...
