2006-09-21T08:50:00.000Z	kling0n		SimonAnibal-Work, no... Xgl  starts correctly
2006-09-21T08:51:00.000Z	kling0n		SimonAnibal-Work, but I get segfault when launching compiz
2006-09-21T08:51:00.000Z	kling0n		SimonAnibal-Work,  compiz is from the quinn repository
2006-09-21T08:52:00.000Z	SimonAnibal-Work	kling0n	So the error pops up at the gdm login or after you log in? Or only when you try compiz?
2006-09-21T08:52:00.000Z	kling0n	SimonAnibal-Work	 I log in fine... running metacity under xgl is working
2006-09-21T08:53:00.000Z	SimonAnibal-Work	kling0n	I concur with gfxstyler
2006-09-21T08:54:00.000Z	kling0n	SimonAnibal-Work	gfxstyler ill give it a try :)
2006-09-21T08:56:00.000Z	kling0n	SimonAnibal-Work	gfxstyler compiz-manager is simply a frontend
2006-09-21T08:56:00.000Z	kling0n	SimonAnibal-Work	gfxstyler it doesnt change that compiz is crashing
2006-09-21T08:58:00.000Z	SimonAnibal-Work	kling0n	did you already mention you installed the dri modules?
2006-09-21T08:58:00.000Z	kling0n	SimonAnibal-Work	dri is loaded... but fglrxinfo will not direct render on the XGL display
2006-09-21T08:59:00.000Z	kling0n	SimonAnibal-Work	xdriinfo says direct render is not enabled on display :!
2006-09-21T08:59:00.000Z	kling0n	SimonAnibal-Work	xdriinfo says direct render is not enabled on display :1
2006-09-21T08:59:00.000Z	SimonAnibal-Work	kling0n	I must confess I run it on AIGLX, and only recently have gotten it to work, I may not be useful to you.
2006-09-21T09:00:00.000Z	kling0n	SimonAnibal-Work	which graphics card are you using?
2006-09-21T09:00:00.000Z	SimonAnibal-Work	kling0n	Onboard Intel
2006-09-21T09:00:00.000Z	SimonAnibal-Work	kling0n	i810 I think
2006-09-21T09:00:00.000Z	kling0n	SimonAnibal-Work	ok
