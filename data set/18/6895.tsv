2008-03-12T13:08:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	lancerocke	What goes wrong when you type killall xfwm4
2008-03-12T13:15:00.000Z	lancerocke	ArthurArchnix	danny@danny-desktop:~/Desktop/openbox-3.4.6.1$ killall xfwm4
2008-03-12T13:16:00.000Z	lancerocke	ArthurArchnix	Thank you for your response
2008-03-12T13:16:00.000Z	lancerocke	ArthurArchnix	It say that xfwm4: no process killed
2008-03-12T13:17:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	lancerocke	what does ps | grep xfwm show?
2008-03-12T13:17:00.000Z	lancerocke	ArthurArchnix	Nothing - danny@danny-desktop:~/Desktop/openbox-3.4.6.1$ ps | grep xfwm
2008-03-12T13:19:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	lancerocke	If you followed the directions you pasted, it would have killed your WM then replaced it with openbox. Have you checked to see if openbox is already running?
2008-03-12T13:19:00.000Z	lancerocke	ArthurArchnix	I i dont know how to do that
2008-03-12T13:20:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	lancerocke	compiz is your window manager
2008-03-12T13:20:00.000Z	lancerocke	ArthurArchnix	so i cant run compiz with openbox?
2008-03-12T13:22:00.000Z	lancerocke	ArthurArchnix	ok i did killall compiz ; openbox & exit and now - http://pastebin.com/m48206aa0
2008-03-12T13:23:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	lancerocke	Well, I don't see compiz, but I don't see openbox either. You desktop must look messed up.
2008-03-12T13:24:00.000Z	lancerocke	ArthurArchnix	my desktop looks normal
2008-03-12T13:25:00.000Z	lancerocke	ArthurArchnix	might emerald be my window manager?
2008-03-12T13:25:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	lancerocke	Dunno, anyway know the instructions say "Now you must log out and log back in. When you go to log out, make sure you check the box that says "Save session for future login" or something like that. When you log back in, XFCE will use Openbox."
2008-03-12T13:28:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	lancerocke	Why are you still here? You did step one of the instructions and it seemed to work. Now do step two. Log out, save session for future login. Log back in. We'll still be here
2008-03-12T13:28:00.000Z	lancerocke	ArthurArchnix	ok brb
