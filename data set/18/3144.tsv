2010-07-11T04:59:00.000Z	waiting		so am i being shunned from the ubuntu community, because my question wasn't easy to answer.  I'm part of the way there.  why is my computer problem less valid than other peoples? if you can't answer my computer trouble just say so.

2010-07-11T05:15:00.000Z	geirha	waiting	What's the timestamp of the lock file?   ls -l /var/lib/dpkg/lock
2010-07-11T05:17:00.000Z	geirha	waiting	third of july... did the computer shutdown improperly around that date? like cable got disconnected or something?
2010-07-11T05:18:00.000Z	waiting	geirha	maybe i force shut down the computer or something. i do that sometimes.  other people use this computer too.
2010-07-11T05:19:00.000Z	geirha	waiting	In that case, it probably happened while a package manager was working, and so it was unable to release the lock.
2010-07-11T05:22:00.000Z	geirha	waiting	That looks good :) Did it just magically start working again?
2010-07-11T05:24:00.000Z	waiting	geirha	no i had to return my sources.list file to default.   i screwed with it while following a tutorial/walkthru online.  it told me to open sources.list delete and replace with some other text.  that i've been told was from system 7 and no longer supported
2010-07-11T05:24:00.000Z	waiting	geirha	i got told that last part here @ #ubuntu
2010-07-11T05:25:00.000Z	geirha	waiting	Ah, I see :)
