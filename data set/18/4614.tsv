2009-10-10T00:33:00.000Z	IdleOne	noren_	with gparted
2009-10-10T00:34:00.000Z	IdleOne	noren_	start gparted and you have to unmount the ntfs partition, then resize. make sure you save whatever data you don't want to lose. Never know what could go wrong.
2009-10-10T00:34:00.000Z	noren_	IdleOne	i already got gparted but the option to resize in ntfs is disabled do i need sometihng exted to activate it
2009-10-10T00:37:00.000Z	noren_	IdleOne	well if thats the case will unmounting it simply help
2009-10-10T00:38:00.000Z	IdleOne	noren_	you can't resize a mounted partition. so yes unmount it
2009-10-10T00:38:00.000Z	noren_	IdleOne	ntfsprogs
2009-10-10T00:38:00.000Z	IdleOne	noren_	install it.
2009-10-10T00:39:00.000Z	noren_	IdleOne	lemme try
2009-10-10T00:40:00.000Z	noren_	IdleOne	well unmounting did not help it only gives me option to Delete or to Format
2009-10-10T00:40:00.000Z	IdleOne	noren_	more then what you had before right :)
2009-10-10T00:41:00.000Z	noren_	IdleOne	nah its the same just as before
2009-10-10T00:44:00.000Z	IdleOne	noren_	seems I did need to install ntfsprogs
2009-10-10T00:44:00.000Z	IdleOne	noren_	sudo apt-get install ntfsprogs and then restart gparted
2009-10-10T00:45:00.000Z	IdleOne	noren_	backup any important data. before resizing, just in case
