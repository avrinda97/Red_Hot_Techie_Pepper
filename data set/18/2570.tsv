2010-04-20T17:36:00.000Z	Rigorm0rtis		Hello, I am having a problem with GNOME in Ubuntu 9.10. Basically, I accidentally dragged about a few hundred emails from thundebird to my panel, and I need a quick way to close them. I tried restarting the computer, but they are still there.
2010-04-20T17:36:00.000Z	bilalakhtar	Rigorm0rtis	select all of them and delete 'em
2010-04-20T17:37:00.000Z	Rigorm0rtis	bilalakhtar	How do I do that?
2010-04-20T17:38:00.000Z	bilalakhtar	Rigorm0rtis	Control-A to select all, del to delete
2010-04-20T17:40:00.000Z	Rigorm0rtis	bilalakhtar	I'm not sure how to do it. I clicked the taskbar and then did the control+a combo and then pressed the delete key and nothing happened.
2010-04-20T17:41:00.000Z	bilalakhtar	Rigorm0rtis	click the desktop and click control-a
2010-04-20T17:43:00.000Z	Rigorm0rtis	bilalakhtar	Won't that delete all of my desktop icons?  I am trying to get rid of all of these panel icons.
2010-04-20T17:43:00.000Z	bilalakhtar	Rigorm0rtis	you dragged the messages on to the panel or desktop?
2010-04-20T17:43:00.000Z	bilalakhtar	Rigorm0rtis	then it wont work
2010-04-20T17:44:00.000Z	bilalakhtar	Rigorm0rtis	so what is coming on the panel?
2010-04-20T17:44:00.000Z	bilalakhtar	Rigorm0rtis	wait a minute I will drag a message on the panel and see for myself
2010-04-20T17:45:00.000Z	Rigorm0rtis	bilalakhtar	when I click one, I get an error message saying the "location is not supported"
2010-04-20T17:45:00.000Z	bilalakhtar	Rigorm0rtis	wait a minute
2010-04-20T17:46:00.000Z	bilalakhtar	Rigorm0rtis	the only solution would be to remove these icons one by one
2010-04-20T17:46:00.000Z	Rigorm0rtis	bilalakhtar	Man, that is going to take forever!
2010-04-20T17:47:00.000Z	bilalakhtar	Rigorm0rtis	never forget that determined people can do stuff in seconds
2010-04-20T17:48:00.000Z	Rigorm0rtis	bilalakhtar	Could there be something in gconf-editor that would let me edit my panel shotcuts?
2010-04-20T17:49:00.000Z	bilalakhtar	Rigorm0rtis	see this one
