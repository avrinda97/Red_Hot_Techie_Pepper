2005-07-06T13:27:00.000Z	Blue_Summer		while using XFCE i chose a dodgey skin and it crashes and i cannot find away to change skins back without the skin box crashing it happend on gnome aswel
2005-07-06T13:28:00.000Z	eyequeue	Blue_Summer	 sounds recursive.  if no one chimes in with a better solution, i'd try mv or rm the dodgy skin file, then trying again
2005-07-06T13:29:00.000Z	Blue_Summer	eyequeue	What does mv or rm mean?
2005-07-06T13:30:00.000Z	eyequeue	Blue_Summer	 commands, MoVe/rename, or ReMove
2005-07-06T13:30:00.000Z	Blue_Summer	eyequeue	ok cool, how do i execute them?
2005-07-06T13:30:00.000Z	eyequeue	Blue_Summer	 mv oldname newname, or rm oldname
2005-07-06T13:31:00.000Z	Blue_Summer	eyequeue	i don't know the name of it its like ivallbook or something i cant remeber the full name and i cant see it because it crashes
2005-07-06T13:32:00.000Z	eyequeue	Blue_Summer	 what ebone said :)  i was presuming you were in console since it seems your gui wouldn't work now
2005-07-06T13:32:00.000Z	Blue_Summer	eyequeue	 console/terminal same thing?
2005-07-06T13:32:00.000Z	eyequeue	Blue_Summer	 applications > system tools > terminal, if you can get there
2005-07-06T13:33:00.000Z	eyequeue	Blue_Summer	 yeah, similar enough for now at least :)
2005-07-06T13:36:00.000Z	Blue_Summer	eyequeue	i can't move the skin because i don't know the name of it
2005-07-06T13:37:00.000Z	eyequeue	Blue_Summer	 yes, and i don't know enough about skins to know where to look for it .... here's a very brute-force means i guess: ls -r | less, then scroll through until you see a filename that looks familiar?
2005-07-06T13:38:00.000Z	eyequeue	Blue_Summer	 tree | less, if you have tree on that box
2005-07-06T13:47:00.000Z	eyequeue	Blue_Summer	 xfce-look.org might :)
2005-07-06T13:56:00.000Z	Blue_Summer	eyequeue	 do you know how to take a screen shot on XFCE?
2005-07-06T13:56:00.000Z	eyequeue	Blue_Summer	 no sorry, i don't think i've ever used it
2005-07-06T14:00:00.000Z	eyequeue	Blue_Summer	 imagemagick: /usr/bin/import
