2006-11-12T14:47:00.000Z	MarcN	CruCiaL-X	the apt-get will get all the needed libraries.

2006-11-12T14:50:00.000Z	MarcN	CruCiaL-X	have you done an apt-get update after editing your /etc/apt/sources.list?
2006-11-12T14:50:00.000Z	CruCiaL-X		marcn: to be totally honest, i havnt a clue, becuase i am a total newbie
2006-11-12T14:51:00.000Z	MarcN	CruCiaL-X	it is very rare that you ever have to download a .deb and use dpkg to install it.  apt-get/aptitude/synaptic/etc all will find all dependancies and download them for you.
2006-11-12T14:52:00.000Z	MarcN	CruCiaL-X	did you just upgrade to edgy?  this is a good idea:    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
2006-11-12T14:52:00.000Z	CruCiaL-X	MarcN	but dont i need and internet connection to upgrade
