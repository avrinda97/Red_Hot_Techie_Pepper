2007-03-26T06:34:00.000Z	brophat		are some of those gui driven firewalls in the packages that you can easily install?
2007-03-26T06:35:00.000Z	lufis	brophat	Firestarter is very userfriendly
2007-03-26T06:35:00.000Z	lufis	brophat	sudo apt-get install firestarter
2007-03-26T06:35:00.000Z	brophat	lufis	so it is in the packages. I thought installing software was point and click
2007-03-26T06:36:00.000Z	lufis	brophat	It is, but there's multiple avenues for installing things
2007-03-26T06:36:00.000Z	lufis	brophat	Not like pasting a command into the terminal is hard or something ;)
2007-03-26T06:37:00.000Z	brophat	lufis	it is for my brother. he has been on windoze all his life
2007-03-26T06:37:00.000Z	brophat	lufis	so you could do it point and click as well right?
2007-03-26T06:37:00.000Z	lufis	brophat	Just tell him to go to applications > accessories > terminal, and paste
2007-03-26T06:37:00.000Z	lufis	brophat	Yes, he could open Synaptic and install it that way
2007-03-26T06:38:00.000Z	brophat	lufis	i thought ubuntu has that intall new software button
2007-03-26T06:39:00.000Z	lufis	brophat	There's lots of ways of installing things. If you go to Add/remove programs on the applications menu and search for "Firestarter" i'm sure you could install it that way too
2007-03-26T06:40:00.000Z	brophat	lufis	ok thanks
2007-03-26T06:40:00.000Z	lufis	brophat	:)
