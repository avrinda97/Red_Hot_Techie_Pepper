2005-08-03T05:04:00.000Z	puff		How hard is it to try an alternative window manager?  How easy is it to back out and go back to the default?
2005-08-03T05:05:00.000Z	procrastinator	puff	Very easy. You can normally choose window manger at the login screen.
2005-08-03T05:07:00.000Z	puff	procrastinator	Ah, so a) is there a window manager cooler looking than enlightenment, and b) is enlightenment easy enough to try out?
2005-08-03T05:08:00.000Z	procrastinator	puff	Can't say, haven't tried enlightenment. I can recommend Fluxbox or Openbox though.
2005-08-03T05:08:00.000Z	procrastinator	puff	Haha ;)
2005-08-03T05:09:00.000Z	procrastinator	puff	Was that perhaps Rosegarden?
2005-08-03T05:10:00.000Z	puff	procrastinator	fluxbox, openbox, why?
2005-08-03T05:10:00.000Z	puff	procrastinator	I don't remember who it was...
2005-08-03T05:11:00.000Z	procrastinator	puff	Well, Fluxbox is full of nice features, but their theme files are fucked up - doesn't matter if you're not going to write the, thought
2005-08-03T05:12:00.000Z	procrastinator	puff	Openbox has less features, but is more "clean"
2005-08-03T05:13:00.000Z	procrastinator	puff	And by the way, check out my screenshot: http://linuxin.dk/eyecandy/1457_3.jpg ;)
2005-08-03T05:13:00.000Z	procrastinator	puff	Don't mind the Photoshop icon, it's an old screenshots
2005-08-03T05:18:00.000Z	puff	procrastinator	Okay, now that's just sick...
2005-08-03T05:19:00.000Z	procrastinator	puff	It's beautiful, isn't it?
2005-08-03T05:21:00.000Z	procrastinator	puff	You like green better? http://linuxin.dk/eyecandy/1457_2.jpg
2005-08-03T05:24:00.000Z	procrastinator	puff	Hurry, launch Gimp. Or open a window.
2005-08-03T05:24:00.000Z	procrastinator	puff	I think it's gas.
2005-08-03T05:41:00.000Z	procrastinator	puff	You can basically figure it out by just looking at another theme
