2006-03-25T17:37:00.000Z	Nabiki	Arafangion	Outlook Express.
2006-03-25T17:37:00.000Z	Arafangion	Nabiki	No, it doesn't.
2006-03-25T17:37:00.000Z	Nabiki	Arafangion	I have it up and going under windows.  New version of outlook express.
2006-03-25T17:37:00.000Z	Arafangion	Nabiki	Hmm, well, there's a few utilities that provide pop3 access to hotmail.
2006-03-25T17:37:00.000Z	Nabiki	Arafangion	I am not saying windows is better, I am simply stating that I know that it does function with hotmail. ^^;;
2006-03-25T17:38:00.000Z	Arafangion	Nabiki	You run it as a daemon, then use your email program of choice.
2006-03-25T17:38:00.000Z	Arafangion	Nabiki	But I haven't tried them.
2006-03-25T17:38:00.000Z	Nabiki	Arafangion	It isn't accessing it via pop3 right now.  :P IT is using the HTTP emial option. ^^;;
2006-03-25T17:39:00.000Z	Arafangion	Nabiki	Think of it as a gateway.
2006-03-25T17:39:00.000Z	Arafangion	Nabiki	Listen to what I'm saying.
2006-03-25T17:41:00.000Z	Arafangion	Nabiki	At my uni, we have access via port 80 on proxy *ONLY*
2006-03-25T17:42:00.000Z	Arafangion	Nabiki	Anyway, imagine  you have three computers.
2006-03-25T17:42:00.000Z	Arafangion	Nabiki	One of them is hotmail (Actually, now that would be impressive)
2006-03-25T17:42:00.000Z	Arafangion	Nabiki	You want your laptop to access hotmail via pop3
2006-03-25T17:42:00.000Z	Arafangion	Nabiki	So you install something on your third computer that turns it into a pop3 server.
2006-03-25T17:43:00.000Z	Arafangion	Nabiki	However, when you laptop accesses your pop3 server, that in turn accesses hotmail via http, that clear enough for you?
2006-03-25T17:44:00.000Z	Nabiki	Arafangion	I get what you are saying. :)
