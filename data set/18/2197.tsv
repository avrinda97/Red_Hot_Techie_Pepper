2010-08-04T02:09:00.000Z	mrman208		I have another question: On my machine, whenever it beeps it gives me a visual beep instead of an audible one, any ideas on how to make it audible?
2010-08-04T02:10:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	mrman208	use KDE or GNOME?
2010-08-04T02:10:00.000Z	mrman208	ilovefairuz	None, it's ubuntu server, pure command line
2010-08-04T02:15:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	mrman208	set bell-style  audible (could be also 'visible' or 'none')
2010-08-04T02:15:00.000Z	mrman208	ilovefairuz	I am sorry, but how do you do that?
2010-08-04T02:16:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	mrman208	type in bash
2010-08-04T02:17:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	mrman208	'set bell-style'
2010-08-04T02:18:00.000Z	mrman208	ilovefairuz	so 'set bell-style audible'?
2010-08-04T02:19:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	mrman208	yes
2010-08-04T02:19:00.000Z	mrman208	ilovefairuz	i did that and pressed ^G and it still gives me a visual beep
2010-08-04T02:21:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	mrman208	are you accessing it with ssh and  terminal emulator ?
2010-08-04T03:54:00.000Z	mrman208	ilovefairuz	Oh yea, I forgot about that.
2010-08-04T03:55:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	mrman208	as long as the first line (shebang) is correct, it will work with any file
2010-08-04T03:56:00.000Z	mrman208	ilovefairuz	Neat.
2010-08-09T02:40:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	mrman208	how did you install to the drive?
2010-08-09T02:41:00.000Z	mrman208	ilovefairuz	First, I erased it with Disk Utility on the Mac. The installed to it using the whole disk and installed the bootloader on the USB.
2010-08-09T02:42:00.000Z	mrman208	ilovefairuz	But that's the thing, I am not trying to install FROM a USB drive, I am trying to install TO it and boot from the USB on a Mac
2010-08-09T02:43:00.000Z	mrman208	ilovefairuz	Wait, nvm, just read the last part :P
