2012-02-19T03:53:00.000Z	mongy	Pikkachu	yes.  and?
2012-02-19T03:51:00.000Z	mongy	Pikkachu	12.04 will fix that
2012-02-19T03:52:00.000Z	Pikkachu	mongy	that what exactly?
2012-02-19T03:52:00.000Z	mongy	Pikkachu	the layout will be more like gnome2.  I'd recommend #xubuntu if you want that sort of thing
2012-02-19T03:53:00.000Z	Pikkachu	mongy	but xubuntu uses xfce
2012-02-19T03:53:00.000Z	Pikkachu	mongy	you answer
2012-02-19T03:53:00.000Z	mongy	Pikkachu	just giving you an opinion from a fellow gnome2 user
2012-02-19T03:54:00.000Z	Pikkachu	mongy	I use gnome, why are you telling me to use xfce, it'll bring cube and panels back in oneiric?
2012-02-19T03:54:00.000Z	mongy	Pikkachu	if you want cube then install compiz, if you want a panel, there is one, always was
2012-02-19T03:55:00.000Z	Pikkachu	mongy	installing compiz doesn't create a cube like that in the video, you need to configure it. As Daekdroom said, unity does not support cubes (aka unity 3d == compiz plugin iirc)
2012-02-19T03:56:00.000Z	mongy	Pikkachu	if confuring anything is too much then, you are right.  don't install compiz and don't enable cube.
2012-02-19T03:57:00.000Z	Pikkachu	mongy	it was already configured and working, see the video
2012-02-19T03:57:00.000Z	Pikkachu	mongy	upgrade broke it
2012-02-19T03:57:00.000Z	mongy	Pikkachu	you are talking about unity or shell, I am not
2012-02-19T03:58:00.000Z	Pikkachu	mongy	can we reset? I'm lost
2012-02-19T03:59:00.000Z	mongy	Pikkachu	sorry, I don't use unity/shell, but I do still use compiz and it works fine
2012-02-19T04:00:00.000Z	Pikkachu	mongy	you've lost me sorry :(
2012-02-19T04:01:00.000Z	mongy	Pikkachu	ok.  what exactly do you want to do and with what desktop environment?
