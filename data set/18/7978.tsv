2008-06-15T13:21:00.000Z	zcat[1]	dr_Willis	Yeah, I was looking for that earlier today as well.. I have a webcam button, I want it to launch tvtime :(
2008-06-15T13:22:00.000Z	dr_Willis	zcat[1]	 theres calculator button/entries. :) use that one!
2008-06-15T13:22:00.000Z	dr_Willis	zcat[1]	 and copy the calculator program to the webcam program
2008-06-15T13:22:00.000Z	dr_Willis	zcat[1]	 heh he.
2008-06-15T13:22:00.000Z	zcat[1]		what if I want to use the calculator button though?
2008-06-15T13:22:00.000Z	zcat[1]		Ohh, I have an IM button
2008-06-15T13:22:00.000Z	dr_Willis	zcat[1]	 bind that to the  Media player button! :)
2008-06-15T13:23:00.000Z	zcat[1]		I use all my media player buttons though!
2008-06-15T13:23:00.000Z	dr_Willis	zcat[1]	 actually im impressed that Ubuntu/Kubuntu normally has All these fancy buttons allready setup.
2008-06-15T13:23:00.000Z	dr_Willis		many disrtos dont do that at all.
2008-06-15T13:23:00.000Z	dr_Willis		Heh - the calculator button DOES popup the calculator
2008-06-15T13:24:00.000Z	zcat[1]		Less than half of mine are set up.. mail (although I use gmail.. can't find a way to make the mail button launch that for me) .. IM isn't.. webcam isn't .. 'logitech' does nothing.. search works, 'shopping' does nothing, 'star' does nothing .. 'home' starts firefox..
2008-06-15T13:25:00.000Z	dr_Willis		I got a cut/paste/copy buttons that dont seem to do squat. and a home button, and one with a folder with a *. (favorites) that are unbound.
2008-06-15T13:25:00.000Z	zcat[1]		I'm pleased the media/play/pause/stop/ff/rw/volume buttons all work though
2008-06-15T13:26:00.000Z	zcat[1]		would be cool if the keyboard shortcuts thing would let you bind any arbritrary key to launch any arbritary command .. but it doesn't :(
2008-06-15T13:26:00.000Z	dr_Willis	zcat[1]	 that would proberly be too confusing to new users  under gnome. :)
2008-06-15T13:27:00.000Z	dr_Willis		!info keytouch
2008-06-15T13:27:00.000Z	zcat[1]	dr_Willis	LESS is not always MORE!!! bloody gnome developers..
