2011-08-12T13:32:00.000Z	koshie_		Actually I've two screens, my 15" on my laptop and a new of 24", when I connect the new on the laptop (VGA) I can't have the 15" on the left of the 24", just a clone or nothing. An idea ? I'm using Ubuntu 10.04.3. Thanks.

2011-08-12T13:37:00.000Z	koshie_		I'm upgrading my 10.04.3 to 10.10 and finally to 11.04 (for Unity)
2011-08-12T13:37:00.000Z	koshie_		I will see with it.
2011-08-12T13:37:00.000Z	Cradam		i would suggest a fresh install of 11.04 koshie_
2011-08-12T13:38:00.000Z	koshie_	Cradam	it's not a problem because I will buy an other PC, it's just for see if the upgrading are really dangerous / not clean
2011-08-12T13:38:00.000Z	koshie_		Just for fun.
2011-08-12T13:43:00.000Z	Cradam	koshie_	found something for you
