2008-08-22T17:33:00.000Z	Nauraushaun		Okay so that's sorted ^.^
2008-08-22T17:33:00.000Z	Nauraushaun		Windows won't work =[
2008-08-22T17:34:00.000Z	Nauraushaun		Oh yeah you've got to shut it down properly
2008-08-22T17:34:00.000Z	Nauraushaun		Darn.
2008-08-22T17:34:00.000Z	unop	Nauraushaun	have you tried mounting this at a terminal?
2008-08-22T17:34:00.000Z	unop	Nauraushaun	you could fix this device using ntfsfix
2008-08-22T17:35:00.000Z	unop	Nauraushaun	see what i said
2008-08-22T17:36:00.000Z	unop	Nauraushaun	sudo aptitude install ntfsprogs && sudo ntfsfix /dev/sdXX  # where /dev/sdXX is the device of the windows partition
2008-08-22T17:41:00.000Z	unop	Nauraushaun	can't you boot up into windows' safe mode?
2008-08-22T17:42:00.000Z	Nauraushaun	unop	I'm not sure.
2008-08-22T17:43:00.000Z	unop	Nauraushaun	boot up into safe mode and run chkdsk on the drive
2008-08-22T17:43:00.000Z	unop	Nauraushaun	you might even be able to fix whatever is wrong with your windows from safe mode.. but more on that in ##windows
