2006-04-11T07:40:00.000Z	vista_	ompaul	i have installed libssl0.9.6, but why it says it can't find libssl.so.5 again?

2006-04-11T07:41:00.000Z	vista_	ompaul	do you know why?
2006-04-11T07:41:00.000Z	ompaul	vista_	I don't know what d4x is
2006-04-11T07:41:00.000Z	vista_	ompaul	it is "downloading for x"

2006-04-11T07:42:00.000Z	vista_	ompaul	if i download one, does it help?
2006-04-11T07:43:00.000Z	ompaul	vista_	please stop a second, your confusing  me, you have a requirement rather than pointing at libraries what is that requirement? is it to download programs or something else?
2006-04-11T07:44:00.000Z	vista_	ompaul	when i run d4x, it says he cant find file libssl.so.5
2006-04-11T07:44:00.000Z	vista_	ompaul	any suggetion?
2006-04-11T07:48:00.000Z	ompaul	vista_	you can now do it the easy way, if you read the info from the bot
2006-04-11T07:49:00.000Z	ompaul	vista_	okay you are going to use the program SYNAPTIC for installing programs, the other information was that you need to install the Universe Repo to get d4x for ubuntu
