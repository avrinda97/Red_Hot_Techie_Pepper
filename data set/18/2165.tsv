2010-08-02T19:59:00.000Z	rbedi99		hi, i'm using  ubuntu 10.04 on an hp mini 110, and the wifi doesnt work -- it's a known issue, however. to fix it, i need to install certain broadcom drivers (bcmwl-kernel-source), which wants me to put in my ubuntu cd in "drive /cdrom/". problem is that i installed from usb, and dont have a cd drive. ideas?
2010-08-02T20:00:00.000Z	blitzo	rbedi99	you can get install them with synaptic i think
2010-08-02T20:00:00.000Z	rbedi99	blitzo	it still prompts for the CD
2010-08-02T20:01:00.000Z	blitzo	rbedi99	then you will have to find out how to enable the appropriate repository and here i'm getting in over my head
2010-08-02T20:01:00.000Z	blitzo	rbedi99	it should not be asking for a cd, it wouldn't be on the cd
2010-08-02T20:02:00.000Z	rbedi99	blitzo	Boromir i think its one of its dependencies that wants a cd, not it itself
2010-08-02T20:02:00.000Z	blitzo	rbedi99	lemme see what google turns up - hang on
2010-08-02T20:04:00.000Z	blitzo	rbedi99	what do you think of this http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1390979 - yes it involves compiling but does it apply to your situation?
2010-08-02T20:06:00.000Z	rbedi99	blitzo	hmm i could try that.. i think my hp mini uses the b43 driver.
2010-08-02T20:08:00.000Z	rbedi99	blitzo	i also tried using hardware drivers, and it says "system error: failed to lock /var/cache/apt/archives/lock
2010-08-02T20:08:00.000Z	blitzo	rbedi99	that means a package manager is running
2010-08-02T20:09:00.000Z	rbedi99	blitzo	but it isn't :)
2010-08-02T20:09:00.000Z	blitzo	rbedi99	hang on
2010-08-02T20:09:00.000Z	rbedi99	blitzo	ohhh apt-get was still working, does that count?
2010-08-02T20:09:00.000Z	blitzo	rbedi99	apt-get is a package manager
2010-08-02T20:09:00.000Z	rbedi99	blitzo	haha okay, my bad :P
2010-08-02T20:10:00.000Z	blitzo	rbedi99	in previous versions there was no lock and they would barf all over everything :(
2010-08-02T20:11:00.000Z	rbedi99	blitzo	okay its trying to install now. hanging at the end, but perhaps its just slow
