2011-04-08T00:53:00.000Z	Jibadeeha	meganerd	will give it go
2011-04-08T00:55:00.000Z	Jibadeeha	meganerd	says /dev/sdb1 was processed successfully ... but still comes up with error 21:   i am convinced it is to do with my ubuntu installation as the usb drive works on my other ubuntu laptop and windows xp laptop
2011-04-08T00:55:00.000Z	meganerd	Jibadeeha	have you tried manually mounting it?
2011-04-08T00:56:00.000Z	Jibadeeha	meganerd	yeah it doesn't even output anything and just returns to the prompt
2011-04-08T00:57:00.000Z	meganerd	Jibadeeha	try this: "sudo mkdir /mnt/test"
2011-04-08T00:57:00.000Z	meganerd	Jibadeeha	then "sudo mount -t ntfs /dev/sda1 /mnt/test"
2011-04-08T00:58:00.000Z	meganerd	Jibadeeha	that is assuming the drive is /dev/sdb1, use the appropriate device
2011-04-08T00:58:00.000Z	Jibadeeha	meganerd	just tried what you said it just doesn't come back with anything
2011-04-08T00:59:00.000Z	Jibadeeha	meganerd	when i do a df it isn't mounted
2011-04-08T00:59:00.000Z	meganerd	Jibadeeha	no errors?
2011-04-08T00:59:00.000Z	Jibadeeha	meganerd	none :(
2011-04-08T00:59:00.000Z	meganerd	Jibadeeha	what about "dmesg |tail"
2011-04-08T01:00:00.000Z	Jibadeeha	meganerd	nothing in dmesg | tail
2011-04-08T01:00:00.000Z	meganerd	Jibadeeha	nothing at all?
2011-04-08T01:01:00.000Z	Jibadeeha	meganerd	i just tailed /var/log/syslog and tried to mount again and it doesn't even make an entry in the logs
2011-04-08T01:01:00.000Z	meganerd	Jibadeeha	"tail -f /var/log/messages" while plugging in the drive
2011-04-08T01:02:00.000Z	Jibadeeha	meganerd	i get all the usual "attached scsi ...." but there is an entry that says "[sdb] Test WP failed, assume Write Enabled"
