2008-12-13T23:15:00.000Z	that_cat		can anyone tell me if there is a way to monitor your bandwidth usage in UBUNTU?
2008-12-13T23:16:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	that_cat	there are a few utilities that will do it. i like  iptraf  a lot
2008-12-13T23:17:00.000Z	that_cat	onetinsoldier	any gui ones?
2008-12-13T23:18:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	that_cat	oh yes.. i forget right now but let me look around a sec
2008-12-13T23:23:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	that_cat	well. i recall now that eons ago i had trouble finding one for X, but i eventually found one. having trouble finding it now tho. but i am almost sure one exists
2008-12-13T23:24:00.000Z	that_cat	onetinsoldier	ok thanks though
2008-12-13T23:24:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	that_cat	keep asking the question occasionally and someone else might know of one
2008-12-13T23:25:00.000Z	that_cat	onetinsoldier	how do you monitor total bandwidth usage of the network in iptraf?
2008-12-13T23:27:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	that_cat	use the 'General Interface Statistics' option
2008-12-13T23:28:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	that_cat	use the 'General Interface Statistics' option, and you can configure options such as kbits/s or kBytes/s
2008-12-13T23:28:00.000Z	that_cat	onetinsoldier	and that shows the total throughput for all computers on the network?
2008-12-13T23:30:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	that_cat	hmmm, i only know about usage for my one lonely desktop system. fool around with it and watch and you will probably figure that out tho
2008-12-13T23:32:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	that_cat	i believe it will just show the usage of the system it's running on
2008-12-13T23:35:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	that_cat	perhaps you'd be interesed in this --> http://freshmeat.net/projects/bwmtools/  ??

2008-12-13T23:39:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	that_cat	roger. if you are looking for something really powerful, have a look at NetMRG
2008-12-13T23:40:00.000Z	onetinsoldier	that_cat	no.. just here on this irc channel when I'm online
