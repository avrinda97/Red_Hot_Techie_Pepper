2007-01-10T12:50:00.000Z	pyrohotdog		Hey, how come I can only get direct rendering when I run startx, and not when I log in through GDM?
2007-01-10T12:50:00.000Z	pyrohotdog		Good luck Croatoan. :)
2007-01-10T12:51:00.000Z	pyrohotdog		You won't turn back. ;)
2007-01-10T12:51:00.000Z	pyrohotdog		Yeah it will.
2007-01-10T12:51:00.000Z	pyrohotdog		Can someone help me with my direct rendering?
2007-01-10T12:53:00.000Z	pyrohotdog		How come I can only get direct rendering by startin X with startx...and not the GDM....?
2007-01-10T12:53:00.000Z	medic30420	pyrohotdog	have you edited your xorg.conf file?
2007-01-10T12:55:00.000Z	medic30420	pyrohotdog	try pasting your xorg.conf file in a pastebin and post the link (scan it first to make sure there isn't any private data in it)
2007-01-10T13:01:00.000Z	medic30420	pyrohotdog	there is a line "XAANoOffScreenPixmaps" "false", is yours false or true?

2007-01-10T13:02:00.000Z	medic30420	pyrohotdog	thanks, i am looking now
2007-01-10T13:08:00.000Z	medic30420	pyrohotdog	i think the problem is that you are missing an option line under the device section
2007-01-10T13:09:00.000Z	medic30420	pyrohotdog	 you do have an nvidia, correct?
2007-01-10T13:13:00.000Z	medic30420	pyrohotdog	it looks like you add the following lines  Option      "XAANoOffscreenPixmaps" "true" :: Option      "DRI"     "true"
2007-01-10T13:14:00.000Z	medic30420	pyrohotdog	to your xorg.conf file, under the device heading (where is says nvidia)
2007-01-10T13:14:00.000Z	medic30420	pyrohotdog	if i were you, i would just install beryl
2007-01-10T13:15:00.000Z	medic30420	pyrohotdog	you have a lot more than that missing from your xorg.conf file
2007-01-10T13:16:00.000Z	medic30420	pyrohotdog	google for beryl nvidia ubuntu xorg.conf and you will find some example xorg.conf files
