2009-08-28T07:46:00.000Z	kangu	mdg	i do apologize in advance.. i am a new user to ubuntu and i have no idea what that means =)
2009-08-28T07:47:00.000Z	mdg	kangu	okay, I assume you are using the Gnome desktop
2009-08-28T07:47:00.000Z	mdg	kangu	you need to install ndiswrapper and ndisgtk first
2009-08-28T07:48:00.000Z	kangu	mdg	i had a buddy of mine who knows more about linux then i do.. i have already installed all those applications and i made ndiswrapper work... but my problem is staying connected.
