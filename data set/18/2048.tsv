2010-09-01T16:04:00.000Z	jeepersz		how do I connect to the internet in ubuntu with dialup?
2010-09-01T16:05:00.000Z	jeepersz		how am I supposed to get the stuff to connect with a modem if I need the internet to get it? That's stupid
2010-09-01T16:07:00.000Z	jeepersz		ubuntu is pretty much worthless for anyone with dialup
2010-09-01T16:09:00.000Z	jeepersz		I can't download all the dumb stuff it says because I don't have an internet connection to do it
2010-09-01T16:10:00.000Z	jeepersz		those programs don't work in windows
2010-09-01T16:10:00.000Z	jeepersz		I can't look at the website in ubuntu, either
2010-09-01T16:11:00.000Z	jeepersz		It looks like i have to compile drivers
2010-09-01T16:11:00.000Z	jeepersz		and identify my modem
2010-09-01T16:11:00.000Z	jeepersz		and blah blah blah
2010-09-01T16:12:00.000Z	jeepersz		I also didn't like the install. It was resizing my partitions before I even knew what it was up to. It could have said that was what I was agreeing to
2010-09-01T16:12:00.000Z	erdnase	jeepersz	it took me 3days just to connect through my wlan. linux isn't windows.
2010-09-01T16:13:00.000Z	erdnase	jeepersz	ubuntu actually tells you everything.
2010-09-01T16:13:00.000Z	erdnase	jeepersz	you should've read everything in there.
2010-09-01T16:15:00.000Z	erdnase	jeepersz	Jeep this isn't windows.
2010-09-01T16:16:00.000Z	jeepersz	erdnase	clearly. Windows isn't such a terrible mess ;)
2010-09-01T16:16:00.000Z	erdnase	jeepersz	so why did you try ubuntu in the first placE?
2010-09-01T16:18:00.000Z	jeepersz	erdnase	I didn't know, going into it, that it would resize my partitions when I clicked "install side by side" I didn't expect it to fail at installing grub, and I thought that it was pretty obvious to include things like dialup drivers
2010-09-01T16:19:00.000Z	erdnase	jeepersz	try going through the installation process again. I'm positive that you can see that ubuntu is goin to resize your partition.
