2008-08-08T21:34:00.000Z	porpoise		one of my windows is translucent for some unknown reason - how do i increase its opacity?
2008-08-08T21:35:00.000Z	pjvandehaar	porpoise	are you using compiz? it has that
2008-08-08T21:35:00.000Z	porpoise	pjvandehaar	yeah i probably do - i have hardy which i think has compiz. I don't really know how to deal with compiz though. I imagine there are new hotkeys to learn

2008-08-08T21:37:00.000Z	porpoise	pjvandehaar	thanks
2008-08-08T21:37:00.000Z	pjvandehaar	porpoise	theres loads of stuff in there to mess with. except for me, because i have a crap graphics card
2008-08-08T21:38:00.000Z	porpoise	pjvandehaar	it does look interesting, though i don't know how much use i have for eye candy. i don't really like jiggly windows, for instance
2008-08-08T21:39:00.000Z	pjvandehaar	porpoise	well, then theres loads of stuff to get rid of and speed up your computer
2008-08-08T21:39:00.000Z	porpoise	pjvandehaar	haha, i suppose :)
2008-08-08T21:40:00.000Z	porpoise	pjvandehaar	i think i will play with it just out of curiosity. It looks fun, and maybe there may be one or two effects that are actually useful...?
2008-08-08T21:40:00.000Z	pjvandehaar	porpoise	try expose
2008-08-08T21:40:00.000Z	pjvandehaar	porpoise	i started using it on mac and really like it
2008-08-08T21:42:00.000Z	porpoise	pjvandehaar	you mean expo? there's no expose
2008-08-08T21:43:00.000Z	pjvandehaar	porpoise	ill look for it real quick
2008-08-08T21:44:00.000Z	pjvandehaar	porpoise	i think so. it seperates all the windows so you can see them all. like on mac osx
2008-08-08T21:46:00.000Z	porpoise	pjvandehaar	i googled for it - i guess it's called "scale"? It's the one that shrinks all the windows and unstacks them so you can see them all at once?
2008-08-08T21:46:00.000Z	porpoise	pjvandehaar	pretty nice
2008-08-08T21:47:00.000Z	pjvandehaar	porpoise	if you're not worried about speed it fun to mess around with stuff like the cubes
