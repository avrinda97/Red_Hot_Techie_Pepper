2010-02-11T01:37:00.000Z	Cr33pz0r		Why is my screen all messed up when I start live cd?
2010-02-11T01:37:00.000Z	ikonia	Cr33pz0r	what video card do you have and what version of ubuntu
2010-02-11T01:38:00.000Z	ikonia	Cr33pz0r	there is a bug with some ati cards
2010-02-11T01:39:00.000Z	Cr33pz0r	ikonia	how do i fix/workaround it
2010-02-11T01:39:00.000Z	ikonia	Cr33pz0r	is it an ati card ?
2010-02-11T01:39:00.000Z	ikonia	Cr33pz0r	frustrating, there isn't really a fix apart from use "fail safe" video mode when you boot
2010-02-11T01:39:00.000Z	ikonia	Cr33pz0r	I know that's not the solution you're looking for, but if you install ubuntu it should be fixable, just not on the livecd
2010-02-11T01:40:00.000Z	ikonia	Cr33pz0r	ahh, that we can fix, use the alternative install CD
2010-02-11T01:40:00.000Z	ikonia	Cr33pz0r	that's a curses based intaller so should work fine
2010-02-11T01:42:00.000Z	Cr33pz0r	ikonia	If i install with the alternate cd, can i install it on external without modifying my PC's HDD's?
2010-02-11T01:42:00.000Z	ikonia	Cr33pz0r	sure
2010-02-11T01:43:00.000Z	Cr33pz0r	ikonia	So if i install and choose extranl hdd, my bootfile won't be affcted of the internal hd?
2010-02-11T01:43:00.000Z	ikonia	Cr33pz0r	not if you install the boot loader on the external hard drive
2010-02-11T01:43:00.000Z	Cr33pz0r	ikonia	How would I do that?
2010-02-11T01:44:00.000Z	ikonia	Cr33pz0r	when you're installing it will ask you where you want to install the boot loader
2010-02-11T01:44:00.000Z	Cr33pz0r	ikonia	How can i found out what to enter as HD?
2010-02-11T01:45:00.000Z	ikonia	Cr33pz0r	during the installer it will identify your hard disks, make a note of them
2010-02-11T02:04:00.000Z	ikonia	Cr33pz0r	doesn't matter
