2009-12-21T20:25:00.000Z	Norse_Nemo		i have a 8 Gig IPod for when I work out and go on mission and a 120 gig zune for when I travel. I have yet to find software the will work with both at the same time
2009-12-21T20:25:00.000Z	airtonix	Norse_Nemo	which ones have you tried ?
2009-12-21T20:26:00.000Z	Norse_Nemo	airtonix	Banshee, Rythmbox and Amerok
2009-12-21T20:26:00.000Z	airtonix	Norse_Nemo	any others ?
2009-12-21T20:27:00.000Z	Norse_Nemo	airtonix	I wasnt aware of any others the work with both
2009-12-21T20:27:00.000Z	airtonix	Norse_Nemo	also : (the underlying problem with those two players (ipod without rockbox) is that they do not expose their music files like a normal external hard drive would.
2009-12-21T20:28:00.000Z	airtonix	Norse_Nemo	has your ipod touchjed itunes 9 yet ?
2009-12-21T20:28:00.000Z	Norse_Nemo	airtonix	never
2009-12-21T20:28:00.000Z	Norse_Nemo	airtonix	never touched any Itunes
2009-12-21T20:28:00.000Z	airtonix	Norse_Nemo	(make sure it doesn't) with that out the way : try out floola
2009-12-21T20:29:00.000Z	Norse_Nemo	airtonix	certainly will, thank you
2009-12-21T20:29:00.000Z	airtonix	Norse_Nemo	thats one suggestion (im not sure if it works with the zune), there are others that might do both
2009-12-21T20:31:00.000Z	airtonix	Norse_Nemo	I know that songbird has ipod management plugin, and it seems that : http://getsatisfaction.com/songbird/topics/zune_support_with_songbird
2009-12-21T20:33:00.000Z	airtonix	Norse_Nemo	out of interest, which medai software on linux do you use that works with the zune  ?
2009-12-21T20:34:00.000Z	airtonix	Norse_Nemo	from memory i recall that banshee worked with my ipod (while it was still alive )
2009-12-21T20:39:00.000Z	Norse_Nemo	airtonix	just fond out im in luck songbird can handle both, but it only works with older zunes that use MTP and not the new MTPZ (mine is old :D)
2009-12-21T20:40:00.000Z	airtonix	Norse_Nemo	small victories
2009-12-21T20:41:00.000Z	Norse_Nemo	airtonix	I take them when I can get them
