2012-09-30T09:51:00.000Z	hmmwhatsthisdo		uhm... you shouldn't need a windows system to make a live USB
2012-09-30T09:52:00.000Z	hmmwhatsthisdo		burning an ISO of the live disc onto a usb drive should be enough
2012-09-30T09:52:00.000Z	cactusfrog	hmmwhatsthisdo	you would think so, but I haven't had any luck with that,
2012-09-30T09:52:00.000Z	hmmwhatsthisdo	cactusfrog	how so?
2012-09-30T09:52:00.000Z	cactusfrog	hmmwhatsthisdo	when I try to boot of a CD it doesn't work, just get a flashing white underscore and nothing else happens
2012-09-30T09:53:00.000Z	hmmwhatsthisdo	cactusfrog	might you be trying to boot an x64 copy of Ubuntu?
2012-09-30T09:53:00.000Z	cactusfrog	hmmwhatsthisdo	no 32 or x86
2012-09-30T09:55:00.000Z	hmmwhatsthisdo	cactusfrog	have you tried re-burning?
2012-09-30T09:55:00.000Z	cactusfrog	hmmwhatsthisdo	yes it was always on a DVD and i burned 4 using different disk burners and at a slow speed
2012-09-30T09:55:00.000Z	cactusfrog	hmmwhatsthisdo	i also tested it on a windows machine and it worked
2012-09-30T09:56:00.000Z	cactusfrog	hmmwhatsthisdo	as retarded as it sounds i don't know the exact kind, it is a new macbook pro 64bit 2.9gz bought in 2012
2012-09-30T09:57:00.000Z	cactusfrog	hmmwhatsthisdo	I searched around and I couldn't find anyone with my exact problem
2012-09-30T09:58:00.000Z	hmmwhatsthisdo	cactusfrog	have you tried installing to USB on a Windows device and booting to the USB on your Mac?
2012-09-30T09:58:00.000Z	cactusfrog	hmmwhatsthisdo	yes actually i was able to install a usb version of ubuntu on a USB and boot off of that, the problem was, that the other flash I had wouldn't plug in when the flash drive i booted off was plugged in...
2012-09-30T09:59:00.000Z	cactusfrog	hmmwhatsthisdo	no they are to close together
2012-09-30T10:04:00.000Z	cactusfrog	hmmwhatsthisdo	so I used a windows machine and installed a version of ubuntu on a flash drive using the drop down install menu, that didn't work either
2012-09-30T10:04:00.000Z	cactusfrog	hmmwhatsthisdo	for that installation it would load but then get to the purple screen with the dots and freeze there, nothing else would happen
2012-09-30T10:06:00.000Z	cactusfrog	hmmwhatsthisdo	yeah very, whats more annoying no one seems to have my problem. Are you sure that I can boot off of a Persistent Bootable Ubuntu USB Flash Drive on a mac
