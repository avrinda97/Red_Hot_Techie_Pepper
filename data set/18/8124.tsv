2008-01-10T10:13:00.000Z	Bakefy	bazhang	thanks for the link, but i have a feeling I am going to run into the same issue with this webite... I think its my hardware settings or something.
2008-01-10T10:14:00.000Z	bazhang	Bakefy	with screenshots! doesnt get easier than that :}
2008-01-10T10:14:00.000Z	Bakefy	bazhang	first time I installed I got a grub 18 error, so i reinstalled with a small boot partiton, unfortuantly it still sticks ... but it gets past grub :)
2008-01-10T10:15:00.000Z	Bakefy	bazhang	I took screen shots of mine too http://westrealm.homeip.net/shots/

2008-01-10T10:15:00.000Z	Bakefy	bazhang	the last image is where I stay.
2008-01-10T10:16:00.000Z	bazhang	Bakefy	you can also try in #ubuntu-server dont know if anyone is around though :}
2008-01-11T23:37:00.000Z	bazhang	Bakefy	the alternate cd will sometimes work when the livecd chokes; what are your system specs, esp ram and cpu
2008-01-11T23:39:00.000Z	Bakefy	bazhang	*, 1.1 Ghrz AMD 512 Ram, 16 MB graphics, trying to install server on an older BIOS. no luck
2008-01-11T23:40:00.000Z	bazhang	Bakefy	where does it fail?
2008-01-11T23:42:00.000Z	Bakefy	bazhang	I can install easily, yes, it does boot the live cd, just fails to make it to the gui arthurARchnix, It usually fails after i install it (with no problems) first it failed on Grub 18 error.
2008-01-11T23:42:00.000Z	Bakefy	bazhang	then I created a small /boot partion, and it got past that error.
2008-01-11T23:43:00.000Z	Bakefy	bazhang	now it fails  just after grup.
2008-01-11T23:43:00.000Z	bazhang	Bakefy	after you added the hdd's?
2008-01-11T23:43:00.000Z	Bakefy	bazhang	yes, it had a 40 GB in there before, worked fine.
2008-01-11T23:44:00.000Z	bazhang	Bakefy	the bios allows for those drives? Jack_Sparrow suggested that earlier..
2008-01-11T23:45:00.000Z	Bakefy	bazhang	Jack_Sparrow, it sees the drives, when it installs it allows me to partition them... it lets me attempt to boot off them... I dont know anything past that.
