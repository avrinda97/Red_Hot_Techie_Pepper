2005-02-03T14:06:00.000Z	godsmoke		heh
2005-02-03T14:06:00.000Z	godsmoke		obviously you're not a debian user :)
2005-02-03T14:06:00.000Z	godsmoke		if you were -- you'd know sid was never that unstable
2005-02-03T14:07:00.000Z	godsmoke		...
2005-02-03T14:07:00.000Z	godsmoke		still ...
2005-02-03T14:08:00.000Z	godsmoke		but you can get mplayer too
2005-02-03T14:08:00.000Z	godsmoke		why do you need 'official' packages?
2005-02-03T14:09:00.000Z	crimsun	godsmoke	so you don't break things horribly.
2005-02-03T14:09:00.000Z	godsmoke	crimsun	huh? -- what does breaking things have to do with this?
2005-02-03T14:09:00.000Z	crimsun	godsmoke	official packages pass a QA process to which unofficial ones aren't subject.
2005-02-03T14:10:00.000Z	godsmoke	crimsun	marillat is NOT going to break your system -- if you think that -- go away -- no use in talking to me
2005-02-03T14:10:00.000Z	crimsun	godsmoke	I'm well aware they won't. I'm the one who made updated packages for mplayer.
2005-02-03T14:10:00.000Z	godsmoke	crimsun	then don't say they will :)
2005-02-03T14:11:00.000Z	crimsun	godsmoke	I didn't say _they_ specifically will.
2005-02-03T14:11:00.000Z	godsmoke	crimsun	you said the reason for not using unofficial packages was so you don't "break things horribly" -- it implied inevitability
2005-02-03T14:12:00.000Z	crimsun	godsmoke	please don't stuff words into my mouth, thanks :)
2005-02-03T14:12:00.000Z	godsmoke	crimsun	I quoted you
2005-02-03T14:12:00.000Z	crimsun	godsmoke	I did _not_ say _all_ unofficial packages will break one's system horribly.
