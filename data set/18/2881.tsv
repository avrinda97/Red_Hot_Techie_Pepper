2010-02-23T06:34:00.000Z	seanbrystone		where would i put a bash script so i can run it from any directory?
2010-02-23T06:34:00.000Z	jrib	seanbrystone	~/bin
2010-02-23T06:35:00.000Z	seanbrystone	jrib	 i dont see ~/bin
2010-02-23T06:35:00.000Z	jrib	seanbrystone	create it, then login again
2010-02-27T03:20:00.000Z	jrib	seanbrystone	you probably don't want to install it manually but use apt instead.  But if you really think you know best, use ~/.mozilla/plugins/
2010-02-27T03:32:00.000Z	seanbrystone	jrib	i installed flashplugin-installer but flash still not working in firefox for 64 bit ubuntu
2010-02-27T03:35:00.000Z	seanbrystone	jrib	nvm i got it, had to restart firefox twice for some reason
2010-03-12T02:39:00.000Z	jrib	seanbrystone	you would need to open a terminal that ran vim inside
2010-03-12T02:40:00.000Z	seanbrystone	jrib	so i cant do it then? ok
2010-03-12T02:40:00.000Z	jrib	seanbrystone	you can, just see gnome-terminal's options (you can run a command)
2010-03-12T04:21:00.000Z	jrib	seanbrystone	yeah, I told you how to do this before...
2010-03-13T02:18:00.000Z	jrib	seanbrystone	that's all I know of
2010-03-13T02:18:00.000Z	seanbrystone	jrib	ok well maybe it's just a setting that I need to poke around in, thanks.
2010-03-16T01:56:00.000Z	jrib	seanbrystone	it means the same thing it meant 20 minutes ago when Losha pointed you to « man chmod » for a detailed explanation
2010-03-16T01:58:00.000Z	seanbrystone	jrib	you got me confused with someone else, losha never told me to 'man chmod'
2010-03-16T02:00:00.000Z	jrib	seanbrystone	opologies, your names were the same length and had the same letters :)
2010-03-16T02:00:00.000Z	jrib	seanbrystone	apologies too
2010-03-16T02:01:00.000Z	seanbrystone	jrib	:D
