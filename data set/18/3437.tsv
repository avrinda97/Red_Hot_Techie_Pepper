2011-08-05T19:43:00.000Z	dli	Narc	the kernel log shows NIC working, but you got problem with system apic
2011-08-05T19:44:00.000Z	dli	Narc	also, 8139too is quite stable for me, can you boot with kernel parameters: acpi=off no apic
2011-08-05T19:44:00.000Z	Narc	dli	That's the part about using a strange power saving mode, is it ?
2011-08-05T19:46:00.000Z	dli	Narc	try noapic first
2011-08-05T19:46:00.000Z	Narc	dli	I tried these with older kernel but never with this one because acpi=off tends to screw everything, including network, but I'll try that right now. Thanks for your help.
2011-08-05T19:46:00.000Z	dli	Narc	try combinations with acpi=off and noapic
2011-08-05T19:47:00.000Z	Narc	dli	I'm trying that right now... We'll see :)
2011-08-05T19:47:00.000Z	dli	Narc	since you mentioned "old machine", it might be an overheating problem, try to improve system cooling
2011-08-05T19:52:00.000Z	Narc	dli	Yeah, it's really an issue, but my friend already bought a base with fans to cool it. I cleaned it the best I could...
2011-08-05T19:53:00.000Z	dli	Narc	taking out the CD-ROM drive, if you can
2011-08-05T19:55:00.000Z	Narc	dli	I'd try that. What it need is RAM, but I don't even want to try. noapic seems to solve it as far as I can tell... Thanks a lot.
2011-08-05T19:56:00.000Z	dli	Narc	still overheating is the real issue
2011-08-05T19:57:00.000Z	Narc	dli	Do you think the network crash is caused by overheating ?
2011-08-05T19:58:00.000Z	dli	Narc	one possibility
2011-08-05T20:02:00.000Z	Narc	dli	Is it possible that apic or acpi is "telling" the module to crash, or am I talking nonsense ?
2011-08-05T20:03:00.000Z	Narc	dli	I mean, because of overheating.
2011-08-05T20:03:00.000Z	dli	Narc	yes, overheating causing invalid processing, signals, etc
2011-08-05T20:03:00.000Z	Narc	dli	Ok, thanks.
