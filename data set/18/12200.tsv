2007-03-01T17:57:00.000Z	ikonia_	yaman	do you have http_proxy defined
2007-03-01T17:59:00.000Z	ikonia_	yaman	don't you have to specify http: in the url so it knows to use the http_proxy variable
2007-03-01T17:59:00.000Z	ikonia_	yaman	if you don't specify http:// in the url it doesn't know what proxy variable to use
2007-03-01T06:00:00.000Z	ikonia_	yaman	no - rebooting won't do anything
2007-03-01T06:00:00.000Z	ikonia_	yaman	set the http_proxy varible
2007-03-01T06:00:00.000Z	ikonia_	yaman	wget -p http://yourserver.com/file
