2012-05-09T02:53:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	krababbel	that's the format, used the wrong keyword though :P
2012-05-09T02:53:00.000Z	krababbel	DarwinSurvivor	thank you :)
2012-05-09T02:57:00.000Z	krababbel	DarwinSurvivor	it is a bug in flash, and not easy to fix
2012-05-10T03:09:00.000Z	krababbel	DarwinSurvivor	does it really matter, if ubuntu acts as a switch between them. I had no problems with such a setup
2012-05-10T03:11:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	krababbel	with kieppies suggestion of using dd-wrt, it would eliminate the ubuntu laptop
2012-05-10T03:12:00.000Z	krababbel	DarwinSurvivor	laptop? I'm not sure of the setup here :) a direct connection between the two routers would be easier, but maybe he wants to use the ubuntu box as a firewall between them?
2012-05-10T03:12:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	krababbel	if you know enough networking to get him going with his old configuration, i'll leave you to it. dd-wrt is just the way that *I* know how to do it :P
2012-05-10T03:14:00.000Z	krababbel	DarwinSurvivor	I had a second router behind the first, and both gave wifi access to the internet.
2012-05-10T03:17:00.000Z	krababbel	DarwinSurvivor	I assumed a wired connection between the routers.
2012-05-10T03:18:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	krababbel	ah :P
2012-05-10T07:55:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	krababbel	did you try the purge command?
2012-05-10T07:55:00.000Z	krababbel	DarwinSurvivor	I'll try purge too.
2012-05-10T11:06:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	krababbel	because Oracle change the license.
2012-05-10T11:06:00.000Z	krababbel	DarwinSurvivor	thanks
2012-05-10T11:10:00.000Z	krababbel	DarwinSurvivor	Isn't icedtea still good? At least debian has it.
2012-05-10T11:11:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	krababbel	if it's not on that page, it probably won't work
2012-05-10T11:28:00.000Z	krababbel	DarwinSurvivor	I installed java7 from a ppa again, and it seems to work well. Libreoffice 3.5 added support as well. :)
