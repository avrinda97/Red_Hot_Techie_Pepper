2010-04-24T15:48:00.000Z	polter	micka	adobe.com/products/flashplayer ?
2010-04-24T15:49:00.000Z	polter	micka	http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/
2010-04-24T15:49:00.000Z	micka	polter	i'm on ubuntu 10.04 :p
2010-04-24T15:49:00.000Z	polter	micka	yeah it should work still though, Adobe Flash is a binary blob and won't mess with your dependencies
2010-04-24T15:51:00.000Z	micka	polter	yes but i'm on 64bit :p
2010-04-24T15:51:00.000Z	micka	polter	yes but i'm on 64bit :p   so it's not that simple
2010-04-24T15:51:00.000Z	polter	micka	well, there is a beta of Flash for 64bit Linux
2010-04-24T15:52:00.000Z	micka	polter	would you like to tell me where ? :p
2010-04-24T15:52:00.000Z	polter	micka	I'm looking for it
2010-04-24T15:52:00.000Z	micka	polter	thx a lot
2010-04-24T15:53:00.000Z	polter	micka	http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/flashplayer10_64bit.html
2010-04-24T15:56:00.000Z	micka	polter	./libflashplayer.so
2010-04-24T15:56:00.000Z	micka	polter	thx anyway
2010-04-24T15:56:00.000Z	polter	micka	you need to replace your old flashplayer with the new one
2010-04-24T15:58:00.000Z	polter	micka	adobe hasn't made it easy for us to get 64bit flash yet so something like http://www.ubuntugeek.com/adobe-flash-player-10-for-64-bit-linux-released-and-ubuntu-installation-instructions.html would probably do the trick
2010-04-24T15:59:00.000Z	micka	polter	Dr_Willis it's work now
2010-04-24T15:59:00.000Z	polter	micka	awesome!
