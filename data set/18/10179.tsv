2007-05-12T06:33:00.000Z	harrisony	zion_da	if you are running on the live cd that is normal
2007-05-12T06:33:00.000Z	zion_da		no
2007-05-12T06:33:00.000Z	zion_da		it's not a live cd ....
2007-05-12T06:33:00.000Z	zion_da		it was ok until i configured
2007-05-12T06:33:00.000Z	zion_da		the tv-out nvidia feature
2007-05-12T06:33:00.000Z	zion_da		and after the menu's are in delay
2007-05-12T06:34:00.000Z	zion_da		also tried to make a gtkrc file
2007-05-12T06:34:00.000Z	zion_da		with delay=0
2007-05-12T06:34:00.000Z	zion_da		and still there's a delay.

2007-05-12T06:36:00.000Z	zion_da		any other ways to change menu delay besides gtkrc ?
2007-05-12T06:39:00.000Z	zion_da	funkyHat	when i disable beryl and move to compiz or the standard ubuntu window managment i have no delay, maybe in beryl ? (i dont know where)
