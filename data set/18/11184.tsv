2007-01-04T06:14:00.000Z	Skyrail		and it's pretty inconveiniant and annoying
2007-01-04T06:14:00.000Z	Skyrail		I just want to put it all back to normal and start from scratch again, although I won't know how to get back to this resolution lol
2007-01-04T06:15:00.000Z	Ignite_	Skyrail	System -> Administration -> Login Window; maybe something is amiss there. :)
2007-01-04T06:25:00.000Z	Ignite_	Skyrail	have you tried changing the GDM theme in System -> Administration -> Login Window?
2007-01-04T06:26:00.000Z	Skyrail	Ignite_	I've left that as default I think
2007-01-04T06:27:00.000Z	Ignite_	Skyrail	something may have become damaged, it might be worth playing around with. Also I do believe you can get some nice themes over at http://art.gnome.org :)
2007-01-04T06:29:00.000Z	Ignite_	Skyrail	Ubuntu Dapper Server is 432.1MB :)
2007-01-04T06:30:00.000Z	Skyrail	Ignite_	ah ok thanks
2007-01-04T06:41:00.000Z	Ignite_	Skyrail	http://www.icewalkers.com/Linux/Software/524620/Perl-Audio-Converter.html <-= this may be of use to you.
2007-01-04T06:46:00.000Z	Skyrail	Ignite_	thanks once again :)
2007-01-04T06:46:00.000Z	Ignite_	Skyrail	np
2007-01-04T06:53:00.000Z	Skyrail	Ignite_	do i have to install Pearl for that?
2007-01-04T06:53:00.000Z	Ignite_	Skyrail	perl is installed by default.
2007-01-04T06:54:00.000Z	Skyrail	Ignite_	ah ok
2007-01-04T06:56:00.000Z	Skyrail	Ignite_	so how do I install it then?
2007-01-04T06:57:00.000Z	Ignite_	Skyrail	not a clue, I just looked it up. If there isn't an Ubuntu package there will probably be a file names INSTALL in the download. Read that and the README file if they exist, it should tell you all you need to know.
2007-01-04T06:58:00.000Z	Skyrail	Ignite_	ok I hope so :) I just want a fresh start with ubuntu and so to save all my music files easily I'll have to convert them :S
2007-01-04T06:59:00.000Z	Skyrail	Ignite_	thanks, I'll really need it
