2007-04-30T16:23:00.000Z	cmihai		I need to know if this is a known bug in Ubuntu or something I've just encountered:  after a fresh install of Ubuntu Feisty (i386, desktop) it does a fsck (file system not checked for 42345 days, forced), finds errors, fixes them and reboots.
2007-04-30T16:23:00.000Z	cmihai		Does this _every_ new install.
2007-04-30T16:23:00.000Z	cmihai		And no, it's not a disk issue (I did a full surface check, it's perfect)
2007-04-30T16:23:00.000Z	cmihai		And SMART also says it's perfect.
2007-04-30T16:24:00.000Z	stefg	cmihai	i remember vaguely having a bug report seen about this... search launchpad
2007-04-30T16:24:00.000Z	cmihai	stefg	I did, but couldn't find anything. Oh well, I'll search again.
2007-04-30T16:25:00.000Z	cmihai	stefg	curse my google-foo. Yeah, it's there.

2007-04-30T16:25:00.000Z	stefg		:-)
2007-04-30T16:26:00.000Z	cmihai		And it's not a timestamp issue. Oh well, I guess it's still better to know it's an Ubuntu issue and not something wrong with my install / disk.
2007-04-30T16:27:00.000Z	stefg	cmihai	reiserfs?
2007-04-30T16:27:00.000Z	cmihai		Ugh, hell no. ext3
2007-04-30T16:27:00.000Z	stefg	cmihai	no, i asked if it's an option for you to use reiserfs....
2007-04-30T16:28:00.000Z	cmihai	stefg	what does that have to do with anything? Besides, I trust reiserfs just about as much as the police trust Resier :P
2007-04-30T16:29:00.000Z	stefg		hehe... reiserfs 3.6 is just fine for me. would be a workaround, because it doesn't happen with fsck.reiserfs
2007-04-30T16:30:00.000Z	cmihai	stefg	probably different fsck enforce rules. But unless it's a bug, it doesn't seem critical.
2007-04-30T16:30:00.000Z	cmihai	stefg	my guess is it sets the fsck create date using local time instead of GTM
2007-04-30T16:30:00.000Z	stefg	cmihai	exactly
