2012-10-16T02:44:00.000Z	zymaster		Hey forgive me for mentioning Windows, but I have a dual boot system with windows 7 and ubuntu. I want to upgrade my Windows to Windows 8 but I want to keep my dual boot in place and keep ubuntu. Will this work? I don't have Windows 8 yet so I can't try anything but just curious if it will work
2012-10-16T02:45:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	zymaster	Your dual boot of ubuntu was not installed from windows was it/
2012-10-16T02:49:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	zymaster	cool, as suggested you will just have to reload grub to the mbr.
2012-10-24T04:58:00.000Z	zymaster	wilee-nilee	it wont allow me to resize extended partition. I can click resize but cant change the volume at all
2012-10-24T04:45:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	zymaster	Are you trying to resize a partiton yuou are booted into?
2012-10-24T04:46:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	zymaster	Sorry you addressed that already can you take a screen shot of gparted and imagebin it.
2012-10-24T04:48:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	zymaster	prtsc
2012-10-24T04:50:00.000Z	zymaster	wilee-nilee	Ok GParted screenshot: http://imagebin.org/233030
2012-10-24T04:52:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	zymaster	So you want the Windows partition bigger right?
2012-10-24T04:54:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	zymaster	No bigie it will take awhile though. YOU should of resized ubuntu to the roght, but you can m,ove the whole partition to the right with the resize button, then right click the extended in the menu and resize it up against the ubuntu partition the the unallocated will be next to the windows fro it to exspand into.
2012-10-24T04:56:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	zymaster	Just for information you could make a NTFS in that unallocated now and windows will see and and you can use it.
2012-10-24T04:59:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	zymaster	It is up against the ubuntu  on the left you have to move the ubuntu to the right, the whole partition at once.
2012-10-24T05:01:00.000Z	zymaster	wilee-nilee	what do you mean move to the right? Sorry didnt understand. And by Ubuntu do you mean the whole extended partition or the file system?
2012-10-24T05:03:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	zymaster	Click on the resize, you can move the whole sda5 to be up against the swap, then using the resize again on the extended move it up against the ubuntu.
2012-10-24T05:05:00.000Z	zymaster	wilee-nilee	Ok it worked
2012-10-24T05:06:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	zymaster	No sure what worked but moving the whole ubuntu partition should take awhile.
2012-10-24T05:07:00.000Z	zymaster	wilee-nilee	It was practically instant, maybe because I haven't really put anything on ubuntu partition yet other than the os
2012-10-24T05:08:00.000Z	wilee-nilee	zymaster	cool, so you understand the process then.
