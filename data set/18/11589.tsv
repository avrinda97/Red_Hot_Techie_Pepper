2008-11-20T04:42:00.000Z	aoupi	ubuntu_	how do you mean replace grub? and what files have windows put there?
2008-11-20T04:43:00.000Z	ubuntu_	aoupi	well, I installed windows after grub, and it uses its own boot loader. Before I did I backed up the grub file in /boot. Now it is not in there no more and there are files such as config-2-5-4-generic, memtest86+.bin and other files
2008-11-20T04:44:00.000Z	aoupi	ubuntu_	thoose files are important :)
2008-11-20T04:44:00.000Z	aoupi	ubuntu_	especialy the ones with vmlinuz or kernel in them :)
