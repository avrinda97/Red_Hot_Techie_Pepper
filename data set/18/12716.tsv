2008-03-30T09:13:00.000Z	lothar		Godo morning. I am having a problem.  New Ubuntu user here.
2008-03-30T09:13:00.000Z	lothar		I installed VLC, the media player, and cant get a directory to open
2008-03-30T09:14:00.000Z	Scunizi	lothar	what directory
2008-03-30T09:15:00.000Z	Scunizi	lothar	you have a directory called TV?
2008-03-30T09:16:00.000Z	Scunizi	lothar	so you have more than one HD and the second is named TV. Is that right?  if so was it in the machine when you installed ubuntu?
2008-03-30T09:16:00.000Z	Scunizi	lothar	can you see the drive when you click on places and computer?
2008-03-30T09:17:00.000Z	Scunizi	lothar	ok.. so you have a link on the desktop .. can you open it and see the files.
2008-03-30T09:18:00.000Z	Scunizi	lothar	is there one particular file you want to play in vlc?
2008-03-30T09:20:00.000Z	Scunizi	lothar	cool..
2008-03-30T09:21:00.000Z	Scunizi	lothar	you could use rythmbox or amorak to manage your  music.. vlc isn't really made to do  that. although it's a great player
2008-03-30T09:23:00.000Z	Scunizi	lothar	yep
2008-03-30T09:24:00.000Z	Scunizi	lothar	I'm not really sure what the problem is yet.. try to describe it..
2008-03-30T09:26:00.000Z	Scunizi	lothar	looks like a flash site is that righht?
2008-03-30T09:28:00.000Z	Scunizi	lothar	maybe
2008-03-30T09:29:00.000Z	Scunizi	lothar	you could try in #linux
2008-03-30T09:33:00.000Z	Scunizi	lothar	the versions get better and better.. nice  thing is you don't have to reinstall.. just upgrade
2008-03-30T09:34:00.000Z	Scunizi	lothar	no
2008-03-30T09:35:00.000Z	Scunizi	lothar	usually integration  gets better
