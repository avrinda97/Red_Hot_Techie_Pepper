2005-07-18T05:07:00.000Z	othernoob		does anyone know a prog to manipulate pdf files?
2005-07-18T05:08:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	othernoob	: pdf2html
2005-07-18T05:09:00.000Z	othernoob	lsuactiafner	I've seen pdf2html..but i don't want to convert it to manipulate it
2005-07-18T05:10:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	othernoob	: pdf is like a zip, not too easy to just manipulate it and expect it to work afterwards...
2005-07-18T05:11:00.000Z	othernoob	lsuactiafner	all i need to do is to make everything black, instead of a few lines in colour, so i can print it.
2005-07-18T05:11:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	othernoob	: just print it with the setting 'black+white only'
2005-07-18T05:12:00.000Z	othernoob	lsuactiafner	if i had found that option,i wouldn't be here ;)
2005-07-18T05:13:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	othernoob	: just drain the colour ink...
2005-07-18T05:13:00.000Z	othernoob	lsuactiafner	and where?
2005-07-18T11:40:00.000Z	othernoob	lsuactiafner	why do you think that mplayer is the greatest?
2005-07-18T11:41:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	othernoob	: look @ freshmeat.net .. mplayer is the most downloaded multimedia package, i'm 1 of the 70% of ppl that prefer mplayer
2005-07-18T11:42:00.000Z	othernoob	lsuactiafner	and that means anything? so far windows is the most used OS my friend ;)
2005-07-18T11:42:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	othernoob	: but its not the most downloaded os (:
2005-07-18T11:42:00.000Z	othernoob	lsuactiafner	it's the most pirated, i'm quite sure it's downloaded as much as linux :p
