2008-08-21T16:48:00.000Z	jorrit_		Does anyone how to start a program on a specific screen using Xinerama for Nvidia 6200 GPU using binary drivers on Ubuntu 8.04? | I only want to start VLC in that mode when a DVD-video is inserted. VLC opens standard when DVD is inserted but on wrong screen.
2008-08-21T16:48:00.000Z	jorrit_		Devilspie doesn't seem to provide enough control for this situation
2008-08-21T16:49:00.000Z	Dr_willis	jorrit_	 i alwyas use 'twinview' with the nvidia drivers and disable xinearams
2008-08-21T16:50:00.000Z	jorrit_	Dr_willis	I want to have apps in fullscreen, restricted to that screen and not pasted over my two monitors, that's why I use Xinerama with seperate X-screens (not displays)
2008-08-21T16:52:00.000Z	Dr_willis	jorrit_	 err...  thats the reason i do not use xinerama -  But i use twinview to set up one very wide display  with 2 monitors. i do not use 2 seperate X sessions.  From what i recall twinview does everything xinerama does.. and more.
2008-08-21T16:52:00.000Z	Dr_willis	jorrit_	 but perhaps more clarification on how you have thign setup is needed.
2008-08-21T16:53:00.000Z	Dr_willis	jorrit_	 for example . I have a 'wide' desktop across 2 monitors. and i have mythtv set where it shows up on monitor #1 fullscreen.
2008-08-21T16:53:00.000Z	jorrit_	Dr_willis	ok what do you need?  do you want my Xconfig-file in the pastebin to peruse?
2008-08-21T16:54:00.000Z	Dr_willis	jorrit_	 if you want to use 2 seperate indipendant X displays where you cant drag a window from one monitor to another. You would have to run the apps and set the display variable befor you run the app.
2008-08-21T16:54:00.000Z	jorrit_	Dr_willis	I can drag my screens from one to the other without problems
2008-08-21T16:55:00.000Z	jorrit_	Dr_willis	they can even overlap.
2008-08-21T16:56:00.000Z	Dr_willis	jorrit_	 you mean windows? In that case you  should be able to just disable xinerama and enable twinview and keep doing the same thing. Full screen apps will then fullscreen to the monitor they are on. (or so its been in my experience)
2008-08-21T16:56:00.000Z	jorrit_	Dr_willis	true, but I want to start VLC when DVD is inserted on a fixed screen automatically.
2008-08-21T16:58:00.000Z	Dr_willis	jorrit_	 check the command line options for vlc would be a good place to start also.
2008-08-21T16:58:00.000Z	Dr_willis	jorrit_	 every time ive ever used xinerama and 'fullscreened' things - they took over both screens. So good luck
2008-08-21T16:58:00.000Z	jorrit_	Dr_willis	thanks for the hint, but there doesn't seem to be cmd-line option for that, I already checked ;-)
2008-08-21T16:59:00.000Z	Dr_willis	jorrit_	 may be some extra vlc config /setting also. I tend to use gmplayer. So you are on your own.
2008-08-21T17:00:00.000Z	jorrit_	Dr_willis	I might be tempted to use that same player if I can get it working, I'm not tied to any player :-D
