2008-09-24T20:26:00.000Z	idimmu		anyone about who knows anything about packages and triggers?
2008-09-24T20:26:00.000Z	idimmu		im packaging a dozen or so java apps and i have to make tomcat stop than start for each but would rather not have that issued 12 times if i upgrade all the packages at once
2008-09-24T20:26:00.000Z	idimmu		apparently triggers might help?
2008-09-24T20:26:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	idimmu	configre Tomcat for hot-delployment
2008-09-24T20:26:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	idimmu	configre Tomcat for hot-deployment, even!
2008-09-24T20:27:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	idimmu	In that mode it scans the webaps directory and deploys any new WARs
2008-09-24T20:27:00.000Z	idimmu		that would make manageing our server farm with puppet a bit of an arse
2008-09-24T20:28:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	idimmu	Through Tomcat manager you should be able to enable/disable a manager applet to do it, too, I seem to recall
2008-09-24T20:30:00.000Z	idimmu		thanks for the alternate point of view IntuitiveNipple but what im looking for is deb-triggers and it seems they're only in hardy/intrepid
2008-09-24T20:30:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	idimmu	ahh, you meant installing debian packages? The mention of Tomcat made me think you meant you were deploying WARs
2008-09-24T20:31:00.000Z	idimmu	IntuitiveNipple	rather than use war we use deb packages for our tomcat app deployments
2008-09-24T20:31:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	idimmu	what OS version is the system? not Hardy I guess?
2008-09-24T20:31:00.000Z	idimmu		dapper
2008-09-24T20:33:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	idimmu	If you're in control of the debian package you could deploy them as pseduo-source then use a 'manager' deb package to do the install.
2008-09-24T20:34:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	idimmu	for example, in another context, DKMS packages are actually source. They simply unpack files without an 'install', and then the system DKMS is triggered to do the 'install' - you could use that technique so the installer is only executed manually via ssh or similar.
2008-09-24T20:35:00.000Z	idimmu		i see what you're saying
2008-09-24T20:35:00.000Z	idimmu		thats quite cool
2008-09-24T20:37:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	idimmu	yeah, have your 'debs' install to a staging area, then execute or trigger the install either manually or by the reinstallation of an 'installer' package - its .postinst script would do the actually install to tomcat of all Java apps in the staging area
