2012-04-05T22:25:00.000Z	scarykitties		Now it's just on a blue screen with a mouse.
2012-04-05T22:26:00.000Z	scarykitties		It is
2012-04-05T22:26:00.000Z	scarykitties		But it's not doing anything so far
2012-04-05T22:26:00.000Z	scarykitties		It may recognize that I'd half-installed Ubuntu
2012-04-05T22:26:00.000Z	scarykitties		And it might be detecting stuff placed on the HDD and trying to run it.
2012-04-05T22:27:00.000Z	scarykitties		Well, then maybe I should restart and try again?
2012-04-05T22:27:00.000Z	scarykitties		Because it's been on this blue screen for about 5 minutes, now.
2012-04-05T22:27:00.000Z	scarykitties		I don't hear the DVD spinning up
2012-04-05T22:27:00.000Z	scarykitties		Yes, mneptok.
2012-04-05T22:27:00.000Z	scarykitties		Hm. Well, it's got 8Gb of DDR800
2012-04-05T22:28:00.000Z	mneptok	scarykitties	then it's not horribly frozen
2012-04-05T22:10:00.000Z	mneptok	scarykitties	you might want to mg5sum whatever .iso you got
2012-04-05T22:12:00.000Z	mneptok	scarykitties	you say that without checking. maybe the .iso is fine, and it's something about the burn of it. too fast? broken optical media?
2012-04-05T22:13:00.000Z	mneptok	scarykitties	you say you cannot boot to a Live session without these I/O errors, right?
2012-04-05T22:15:00.000Z	mneptok	scarykitties	it may be ACPI settings generally, but not being able to access a particular SATA device in general should not affect a Live session.
2012-04-05T22:26:00.000Z	mneptok	scarykitties	no.
2012-04-05T22:27:00.000Z	mneptok	scarykitties	patience.
2012-04-05T22:27:00.000Z	mneptok	scarykitties	can you move the mouse cursor?
