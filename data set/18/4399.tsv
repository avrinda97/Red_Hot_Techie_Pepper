2009-04-19T18:43:00.000Z	Elob		hmm
2009-04-19T18:43:00.000Z	Elob		I am having a weird problem with apt-get
2009-04-19T18:43:00.000Z	Elob		I am trying to remove Python
2009-04-19T18:43:00.000Z	Elob		but when I run apt-get remove python
2009-04-19T18:44:00.000Z	Elob		it tries to remove everything
2009-04-19T18:44:00.000Z	Elob		667mb of packages
2009-04-19T18:44:00.000Z	LjL	Elob	pastebin the exact output that it gives
2009-04-19T18:44:00.000Z	Elob	LjL	http://www.mibbit.com/pb/nodoFH
2009-04-19T18:45:00.000Z	LjL	Elob	jelly12gen is right, why do you want to remove python?
2009-04-19T18:46:00.000Z	LjL	Elob	also, your pastebin doesn't load for me (but it'd probably just confirm it's all packages that do actually need python, anyway)
2009-04-19T18:46:00.000Z	LjL	Elob	i really doubt that removing python would solve that
2009-04-19T18:47:00.000Z	LjL	Elob	i suppose you have installed beautifulsoup using the repo package?
2009-04-19T18:47:00.000Z	LjL	Elob	oh, wonderful
2009-04-19T18:48:00.000Z	LjL	Elob	use "debsums -s" to find out which files were mangled by installing stuff manually, then reinstall those packages with "sudo apt-get --reinstall install packagenames"
2009-04-19T18:49:00.000Z	LjL	Elob	install it.
2009-04-19T18:51:00.000Z	LjL	Elob	some are normal, for instance the ones about dictionaries
2009-04-19T18:52:00.000Z	LjL	Elob	it's probably because you're on Jaunty. you should be asking on #ubuntu+1 really.
2009-04-19T18:53:00.000Z	LjL	Elob	it *was* full of warnings that jaunty wasn't ready, after all.
