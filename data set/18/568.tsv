2012-03-17T03:16:00.000Z	fman23		All of the sudden my file's names were replaced with ECRYPT_FENK_ENCRYPTED.FWYU-<random ascii characters>.  This happened in the middle of an sftp session.  Does anyone know what might have caused this and how i can remedy this without stopping any services running as the user?
2012-03-17T03:17:00.000Z	savage	fman23	thanks i'll try that
