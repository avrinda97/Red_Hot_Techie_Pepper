2007-11-08T10:04:00.000Z	badkitty_		Everyone having sound problems with gutsy??
2007-11-08T10:04:00.000Z	Gnea	badkitty_	works fine here
2007-11-08T10:04:00.000Z	Gnea	badkitty_	it's gdm that's messed up for me
2007-11-08T10:04:00.000Z	badkitty_	Gnea	lol
2007-11-08T10:04:00.000Z	Gnea	badkitty_	it's really pissing me off too
2007-11-08T10:05:00.000Z	Gnea	badkitty_	sound or gfx?
2007-11-08T10:12:00.000Z	Gnea	badkitty_	nvidia legacy - if i nail gdm and type X by itself, it's just fine
2007-11-08T10:12:00.000Z	Gnea	badkitty_	it gets worse - looks like it's unloading the synaptics driver as soon as everything is up
2007-11-08T10:14:00.000Z	Gnea	badkitty_	freenode sucks a lot of arse tonight
2007-11-08T10:15:00.000Z	Gnea	badkitty_	no, i got on to get help just as they happened. so between gutsy not working right and netsplits....
2007-11-08T10:15:00.000Z	Gnea	badkitty_	what about it?
2007-11-08T10:16:00.000Z	Gnea	badkitty_	i just saw lots of question marks... yeah, i've been using E for years
2007-11-08T10:17:00.000Z	Gnea	badkitty_	sticking with gnome for now - i need a stable system
2007-11-08T10:18:00.000Z	Gnea	badkitty_	it's worth trying :)
2007-11-08T10:19:00.000Z	Gnea	badkitty_	i first got wind of it a decade ago when i was looking for something nicer than fvwm
