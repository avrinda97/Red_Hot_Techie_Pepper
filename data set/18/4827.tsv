2009-05-08T22:58:00.000Z	matreya6	helper	you can set quotas in user management
2009-05-08T22:59:00.000Z	helper	matreya6	actually i didn't understand :(
2009-05-08T23:00:00.000Z	matreya6	helper	if you want to do it from the cmdline, try usermod
2009-05-08T23:03:00.000Z	helper	matreya6	u mean create a user? or directory for home ?
2009-05-08T23:04:00.000Z	matreya6	helper	with usermod you can adjust the rights and settings for users, you can for instance define the size of a homedir, yes...
2009-05-08T23:04:00.000Z	helper	matreya6	 i try don't find a option to define size . i try man usermod can u check it for min ?
2009-05-08T23:05:00.000Z	matreya6	helper	sure...just a moment
2009-05-08T23:05:00.000Z	helper	matreya6	thx
2009-05-08T23:08:00.000Z	matreya6	helper	here's some nice reading for you. It discusses Debian, but should work fine when the cmd-line commands are concerned: http://www.debianadmin.com/implement-and-manage-disk-quotas-in-linux.html
2009-05-08T23:10:00.000Z	helper	matreya6	i check it . where i can specify the size here what i mean
2009-05-08T23:14:00.000Z	matreya6	helper	edquota -u <username>
2009-05-08T23:15:00.000Z	helper	matreya6	 No filesystems with quota detected.
2009-05-08T23:16:00.000Z	matreya6	helper	true, but you should enable quota mgmt. for the filesystems first, as discussed in the Debian article I linked you to previously
2009-05-08T23:28:00.000Z	helper	matreya6	 i did quotaon -a it work then i type quotaon -u /home/kad give me : quotaon: Mountpoint (or device) /home/kad not found or has no quota enabled.
2009-05-08T23:29:00.000Z	matreya6	helper	actually the error message speaks for itself, check the part in the Debian Admin link that talks about fstab and settings there...
2009-05-08T23:54:00.000Z	helper	matreya6	 give me error mount: /home/kad is not a block device
2009-05-08T23:56:00.000Z	matreya6	helper	could you pastebin a summary what you have done before you got this error?
