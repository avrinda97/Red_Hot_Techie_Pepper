2008-07-15T03:55:00.000Z	Reformer81	travis	What do you mean by "screen"?
2008-07-15T03:55:00.000Z	Reformer81	travis	Resolution and such?
2008-07-15T03:55:00.000Z	Reformer81	travis	Yes, you can configure all that manually in Xorg.
2008-07-15T03:56:00.000Z	Reformer81	travis	/etc/X11/xorg.conf
2008-07-15T03:56:00.000Z	Reformer81	travis	However, like gnuB_Chris said, when you install the nVidia drivers, that should all be configured automatically for you.
2008-07-15T03:57:00.000Z	Reformer81	travis	So, your monitor then?
2008-07-15T03:57:00.000Z	Reformer81	travis	And did you go to System -> Preferences -> Screen Resolution?
2008-07-15T03:58:00.000Z	Reformer81	travis	Is that the model number of your monitor?
