2011-05-03T07:05:00.000Z	tortoise		Hey guys, I just bought a Nikon d3000 today and i'm trying to look at the software in came with, but the software is made for only OSX and Windows. Could someone help to get it to work with lucid?
2011-05-03T07:06:00.000Z	KM0201	tortoise	its unlikely it will work w/linux... is that a camera?
2011-05-03T07:06:00.000Z	tortoise	KM0201	yes it is, would it be possibly to get it to work in Wine?
2011-05-03T07:07:00.000Z	KM0201	tortoise	very unlikely.. wine doesn't work w/ hardware (which is what you'd be asking it to do).. just plug the camera in, and most likely it will be detected as a flash drive, and you can drag/drop off of it.. then use gimp or whatever, to fix your images
2011-05-03T07:07:00.000Z	tortoise	KM0201	I've already tried it. Also, I don't think wine would need to work with hardware for it to work with Nikon's software.
2011-05-03T07:07:00.000Z	KM0201	tortoise	it might work in wine, but i've never gotten wine to work w/ hardware (thus why wine won't work w/ itunes to sync ipods, or zune software to sync zunes, etc..)
2011-05-03T07:08:00.000Z	KM0201	tortoise	you want the nikon to see the camera, correct?.. tell me how it's gonna do that, w/o working w/ hardware
2011-05-03T07:08:00.000Z	tortoise	KM0201	OH wow. I misread your first message. Well, an attempt is always worth it.
2011-05-03T07:08:00.000Z	tortoise	KM0201	but again, I've never used wine before, so how would I even begin?
2011-05-03T07:09:00.000Z	KM0201	tortoise	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1447104&page=2   amazing what google shows...
2011-05-03T07:12:00.000Z	tortoise	KM0201	thanks, and I'm sorry for wasting your 6 minutes when I could've googled it. I should have never disturbed your peace.
2011-05-03T07:12:00.000Z	KM0201	tortoise	youd idn't bother me.. lol, just saying, google turns up a lot of hits on it (most don't seem tog et it to work)
2011-05-03T07:13:00.000Z	tortoise	KM0201	yeah, tbh I skipped google this time because I figured someone here could at least tell me how to do it in wine faster than i could find it on google. lol
2011-05-03T07:13:00.000Z	KM0201	tortoise	the chances of it working wine, are slim to be honest.. but if you insist, ask in #wine
2011-05-03T07:14:00.000Z	tortoise	KM0201	okay, I will if nothing in this thread works
2011-05-03T07:14:00.000Z	KM0201	tortoise	sorry, #winehq
2011-05-03T07:24:00.000Z	tortoise	KM0201	if you're interested, I just now found the sd slot on my computer. so no need for software (other than fspot). Thanks for the link!
2011-05-03T07:25:00.000Z	KM0201	tortoise	well that solves the prob w/o the camera then.. great.
