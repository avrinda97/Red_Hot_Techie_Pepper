2005-08-09T06:14:00.000Z	Code_Dark		does ubuntu come prepackaged with madwifi?
2005-08-09T06:15:00.000Z	Code_Dark		(excuse me for the barrage of questions, I'm trying to decide in like 20 seconds if I should install it on my laptop)
2005-08-09T06:15:00.000Z	windex	Code_Dark	it's like debian, and uses apt/aptitude/synaptic.
2005-08-09T06:17:00.000Z	windex	Code_Dark	just keep in mind, the livecd isin't always as successful as a full install at working with hardware. from my time in this channel, i've seen that most laptops, while they do get X running ok, do have problems with 3d acceleration.
2005-08-09T06:18:00.000Z	Code_Dark	windex	all I'm really worried about is getting my wireless card to work. I'll probably use something like fluxbox for my xwm, so.
2005-08-09T06:18:00.000Z	windex	Code_Dark	ah. the default gnome install, while being gnome, dosen't seem to be as laggy as the old gnome was, so you might want to play with it for awhile before giving up since most of the configuration utilities are really easy to find using it.
2005-08-09T06:19:00.000Z	Code_Dark	windex	hm, alright. i may.
2005-08-09T06:20:00.000Z	windex	Code_Dark	im looking at info on your wireless card, hold a sec. :)
2005-08-09T06:20:00.000Z	Code_Dark	windex	thanks :)
2005-08-09T06:21:00.000Z	windex	Code_Dark	it appears that some flavors of your card need an upgraded driver to function, depending on how new the firmware is. you may need to download a development enviroment and the ubuntu kernel headers and source package and then re-build the madwifi module.
2005-08-09T06:22:00.000Z	Code_Dark	windex	it's the 'C2' version of the card, if that helps. hm. i'll try the livecd and see if it works 'out of the box' or not, then check out the options.
2005-08-09T06:23:00.000Z	windex	Code_Dark	let me get you the link i just read. the howto is mostly accurate, with a few mistakes in pathnames (namely, the symlink command they give): http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=36800
2005-08-09T06:23:00.000Z	Code_Dark	windex	thanks
2005-08-09T06:23:00.000Z	windex	Code_Dark	np. :)
2005-08-09T06:25:00.000Z	windex	Code_Dark	btw, this machine is a duron 1400 w/ 256mb of ram and a 40gb ide drive, and it's fast and responsive running gnome. :) which, uh, should be impossible. but whatever.
2005-08-09T06:25:00.000Z	Code_Dark	windex	I'm (will be) using a pII laptop with 128mb ram, so...
2005-08-09T06:25:00.000Z	windex	Code_Dark	you might need a smaller window manager then. :)
2005-08-09T06:26:00.000Z	Code_Dark	windex	yeah, I'll probably use fluxbox or xfce
