2005-02-10T10:19:00.000Z	crimsun	Luke	yes.
2005-02-10T10:19:00.000Z	crimsun	Luke	apt-cache itself depends only on the sources.list you have locally
2005-02-10T10:20:00.000Z	Luke	crimsun	thats what i thought - do you know how to change the source listing to debains?
2005-02-10T10:20:00.000Z	crimsun	Luke	but if you meant to ask if you can use Debian repositories, the answer is different: please do not use Debian repos.
2005-02-10T10:20:00.000Z	crimsun	Luke	you _will_ create headaches for yourself by installing packages from Debian repos.
2005-02-10T10:21:00.000Z	Luke	crimsun	well is there a way to get more programs that arent in ubuntu's repository?
2005-02-10T10:21:00.000Z	Luke	crimsun	like openbox?
2005-02-10T10:21:00.000Z	crimsun	Luke	openbox is available in universe.
2005-02-10T10:21:00.000Z	Luke	crimsun	whats that mean (sorry i'm new to ubuntu)
2005-02-10T10:22:00.000Z	crimsun	Luke	http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/UniversePackages/
