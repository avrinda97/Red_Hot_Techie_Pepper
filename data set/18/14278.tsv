2005-08-27T12:28:00.000Z	fdorrington		does anyone know how to use gnome keyring?
2005-08-27T12:29:00.000Z	fdorrington		or how I can get sound to record via the mic without it projecting through the speakers?
2005-08-27T12:29:00.000Z	bob2	fdorrington	best to just ask your question
2005-08-27T12:29:00.000Z	fdorrington	bob2	asked it a few time without replies throughout the day.
2005-08-27T12:30:00.000Z	bob2	fdorrington	yes, so it's best to ask that, instead of your meta-question earlier
2005-08-27T12:31:00.000Z	bob2	fdorrington	why do you want to disable it?
2005-08-27T12:32:00.000Z	bob2	fdorrington	and it affects newly created users?
2005-08-27T12:33:00.000Z	fdorrington	bob2	try what?
2005-08-27T12:33:00.000Z	bob2	fdorrington	try creating a new user and see if it affects them.  I'd be very surprised if it did.
2005-08-27T12:33:00.000Z	fdorrington	bob2	I need to stop it from affecting this user
2005-08-27T12:34:00.000Z	bob2	fdorrington	that's a different question then
2005-08-27T12:34:00.000Z	fdorrington	bob2	that's correct it was enabled as a test and it has been decided that it isn't wanted
2005-08-27T12:34:00.000Z	fdorrington	bob2	so now it needs to be disabled
2005-08-27T12:35:00.000Z	fdorrington	bob2	sorry didn't think it made a difference. Disabling it is disabling it I thought. So with that bit of information in mind do you know how I can disable it?
2005-08-27T12:38:00.000Z	bob2	fdorrington	did you run "gnome-keyring-manager" and delete the keyring?
2005-08-27T12:39:00.000Z	fdorrington	bob2	that would be handy. don't know how to access the manager
2005-08-27T12:39:00.000Z	bob2	fdorrington	that's the name of the command...
2005-08-27T12:42:00.000Z	fdorrington	bob2	that command isn't found
