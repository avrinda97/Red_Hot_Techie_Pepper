2008-07-24T18:01:00.000Z	TiredWolf		what's the choice of picture viewers in kde? you can spare me the ones that show up with apt-cache search image viewer, as i'm already aware of those ;) but is there anything else?
2008-07-24T18:02:00.000Z	jameslr	TiredWolf	hmm Picasa?http://picasa.google.com/linux/
2008-07-24T18:02:00.000Z	TiredWolf	jameslr	hm thanks, but i meant in the official repositories (and free)
2008-07-24T18:02:00.000Z	jameslr	TiredWolf	Picasa is free
2008-07-24T18:03:00.000Z	TiredWolf	jameslr	not free as linux users usually mean by "free", i'm afraid
2008-07-24T18:03:00.000Z	TiredWolf	jameslr	is it under a free software license?
2008-07-24T18:04:00.000Z	jameslr	TiredWolf	it's not GPL if that's what you mean
2008-07-24T18:04:00.000Z	TiredWolf	jameslr	well, other free licenses would also do, not necessarily GPL... but yeah, open source is what i mean
2008-07-24T18:04:00.000Z	jameslr	TiredWolf	not open sores.
2008-07-24T18:05:00.000Z	jameslr	TiredWolf	why so particular? You just need an image viewer. There are many alternatives. Image Magick being one...
2008-07-24T18:07:00.000Z	TiredWolf	jameslr	uh, imagemagick is an image viewer? thought it was only a command-line manipulation program. anyway, i'm looking for some pretty specific combination of features, so i'd like to know about as many alternatives as possible. to give you an idea, i want always-on-screen shot data (shutterspeed, aperture, iso), hopefully superimposed on the image, and zoom locking on multiple images, and lossless JPEG operations, and canon raw
2008-07-24T18:17:00.000Z	jameslr	TiredWolf	sounds like you're looking for a photoshop replacement then?
2008-07-24T18:17:00.000Z	TiredWolf	jameslr	uh... no?
2008-07-24T18:18:00.000Z	TiredWolf	jameslr	i said i want a *viewer*, and that's one of the reasons why the GIMP won't do. i want something frills-free, with next and previous buttons to browse through images, little thumbnails, *and* the few editing features that someone using a digital camera would like when fetching and comparing their photos. and that's zoom-lock, lossless jpeg transforms, and easily accessible exif info

2008-07-24T18:20:00.000Z	TiredWolf	jameslr	hm, i'll try kphotoalbum, i hadn't come across that one
2008-07-24T18:20:00.000Z	jameslr	TiredWolf	pay attention to XnView - maybe that has some of the extended features you're looking for
2008-07-24T18:21:00.000Z	TiredWolf	jameslr	yup, i was already aware of that one. its defects are it's not KDE and it's not free software, but i do know it has just about all the features i want, so i'll keep in mind anyway
