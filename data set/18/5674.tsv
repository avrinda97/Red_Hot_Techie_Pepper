2008-09-09T21:57:00.000Z	Russian		hehe k guys tnx
2008-09-09T21:57:00.000Z	Russian		64 it is
2008-09-09T21:59:00.000Z	Russian		sweet
2008-09-09T22:01:00.000Z	Russian		2 times damn
2008-09-09T22:01:00.000Z	Russian		6 gb o_o
2008-09-09T22:03:00.000Z	Russian		I got 3GB of ram
2008-09-09T22:04:00.000Z	Russian		So 3GB at least for hibernation, means 6GB is the perfect amount then>
2008-09-09T22:04:00.000Z	icarus-c	Russian	somehow with more ram than 2GB can reduce the ratio
2008-09-09T22:05:00.000Z	icarus-c	Russian	as long as you don't user hibernate or something
2008-09-09T22:05:00.000Z	icarus-c	Russian	just x1.5 will do
2008-09-09T22:05:00.000Z	Russian	icarus-c	even if I use sleep ?
2008-09-09T22:06:00.000Z	icarus-c	Russian	um.. i have no experience about sleep
2008-09-09T22:10:00.000Z	icarus-c	Russian	so as to conclude: if you need hibernate ->  more than 3GB ; else -> whatever
2008-09-09T22:11:00.000Z	icarus-c	Russian	i suggest 4.5
2008-09-09T22:16:00.000Z	icarus-c	Russian	sleep won't need swap
2008-09-09T22:24:00.000Z	icarus-c	Russian	that's a good practise
2008-09-09T22:26:00.000Z	Russian	icarus-c	gdnight
2008-09-09T22:26:00.000Z	Russian	icarus-c	hehe tnx should be just fine =)
