2006-07-01T07:48:00.000Z	[1] bill	robertj	its justified.  I would have noticed my harddrive was failing alot sooner if it would have been more often
2006-07-01T07:49:00.000Z	robertj		[1] bill: or within an hour or so if the smart notification let you know via gui
2006-07-01T07:49:00.000Z	[1] bill	robertj	 By the time I started getting errors I had lost half the harddisk.
2006-07-01T07:49:00.000Z	[1] bill	robertj	the fsck errors started earlier, I just didn't really notice them
2006-07-01T07:49:00.000Z	robertj		[1] bill: I'm sorry to hear about that. If your disk supported smart (and the vast majority do) it would have let you know very quickly
2006-07-01T07:49:00.000Z	[1] bill	robertj	it does, and it was enabled =)
2006-07-01T07:50:00.000Z	robertj		[1] bill: but no imnotify hook for it :(
2006-07-01T07:51:00.000Z	robertj	Sub	what did fsck tell you?
2006-07-01T07:53:00.000Z	robertj	Sub	my position is that we will catch 99.9% of the people before + lots of additional people if we switch over to nixing the scheduled fsck's and going to user-friendly SMART monitoring
2006-07-01T07:54:00.000Z	robertj	Sub	aint' gonna happen
2006-07-01T07:55:00.000Z	robertj	Sub	it's an additional expense with little benefit because most users don't care about their data enough to even back it up to DVD
2006-07-01T07:55:00.000Z	robertj	Sub	it's a great benefit to people who _do_ but those people will get RAID now if they want it
2006-07-01T07:56:00.000Z	[1] bill	robertj	I will agree the smart monitoring needs to be better.
2006-07-01T07:57:00.000Z	[1] bill		the stuff in the logs is rather cryptic I'm afraid
2006-07-01T07:57:00.000Z	robertj		[1] bill: 99.9% of people don't read logs
2006-07-01T07:58:00.000Z	robertj		I'm just trying to ferment my ideas here
2006-07-01T07:58:00.000Z	[1] bill	robertj	well I mean, I saw a few smart messages on the console, but it couldn't tell me what they were saying.  It wasn't WARNING HARDDRIVE IN ANGER, it was, unknown msg or what not
2006-07-01T07:58:00.000Z	[1] bill	robertj	I'm assuming they were smart messages, they could have been kernel messages. Its definately not obvious what they are.
