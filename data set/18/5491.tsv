2008-10-14T21:53:00.000Z	bj0rn2		ok.. I'll get to work. Thanks alot Scunizi and BlueEagle
2008-10-14T21:54:00.000Z	Scunizi	bj0rn2	on install did you also create a different /home partition? if not you might make that your next project. :)
2008-10-14T21:49:00.000Z	Scunizi	bj0rn2	grub was placed on the wrong drive.  I have 3 drives and sometimes it's tough figuring out where to place the grub files..
2008-10-14T21:50:00.000Z	bj0rn2	Scunizi	the wrong drive as in the MBR of the wrong drive?
2008-10-14T21:50:00.000Z	Scunizi	bj0rn2	yes
2008-10-14T21:50:00.000Z	bj0rn2	Scunizi	why would it do this?
2008-10-14T21:51:00.000Z	Scunizi	bj0rn2	I checked mine by changing the boot order of the drives .. it found grub and worked.
2008-10-14T21:51:00.000Z	Scunizi	bj0rn2	I have a mix of sata and ide drives.. the installer got confused for me.. I also had the boot flag on all drives.
2008-10-14T21:52:00.000Z	bj0rn2	Scunizi	ok so I should try again now that I have only one boot flag?
2008-10-14T21:52:00.000Z	Scunizi	bj0rn2	nope.. cought that.. however now that there is only one.. redo grub again
2008-10-14T21:52:00.000Z	bj0rn2	Scunizi	also, do you think I need to restore original MBR and windows boot sector first?
2008-10-14T21:53:00.000Z	Scunizi	bj0rn2	no
2008-10-14T21:55:00.000Z	bj0rn2	Scunizi	no I didn't, I have only a single partition.. why? :)
2008-10-14T21:55:00.000Z	Scunizi	bj0rn2	having a separate /home makes it easy to reinstall if needed.. you won't loose your data
2008-10-14T21:56:00.000Z	bj0rn2	Scunizi	ah yes.. if you put your data in home and not all over the place ;)
2008-10-14T21:56:00.000Z	Scunizi	bj0rn2	my rule of thumb on partitions for installation (space dependent) is 8-12gig for / (root).. 1 gig for /swap and the rest for /home.
2008-10-14T22:45:00.000Z	bj0rn2	Scunizi	no luck :( seems installing GRUB on my first disk corrupts the partition table
2008-10-14T22:46:00.000Z	Scunizi	bj0rn2	shouldn't have.
