2009-03-26T06:57:00.000Z	EvilAIM	drummerkid	did you want me to help ya out?
2009-03-26T06:58:00.000Z	EvilAIM	drummerkid	then please don't repeat your question.
2009-03-26T06:58:00.000Z	EvilAIM	drummerkid	so have you mounted the drive?
2009-03-26T07:00:00.000Z	EvilAIM	drummerkid	is it ext3?

2009-03-26T07:01:00.000Z	drummerkid	EvilAIM	thanks
2009-03-26T07:05:00.000Z	EvilAIM	drummerkid	what do you mean?
2009-03-26T07:06:00.000Z	EvilAIM	drummerkid	so, you type it in terminal, and then it went to the next line?
2009-03-26T07:07:00.000Z	EvilAIM	drummerkid	and if that didn't work, try: sudo chmod -R 777 /media/disk-1
2009-03-26T07:13:00.000Z	EvilAIM	drummerkid	what is the mount point?
2009-03-26T07:22:00.000Z	EvilAIM	drummerkid	the system you're trying to get on, why not just boot to it?
