2008-07-05T00:12:00.000Z	blockhd		guys
2008-07-05T00:12:00.000Z	blockhd		are you using nvidia graphic cards?
2008-07-05T00:13:00.000Z	blockhd		i need help choosing right driver
2008-07-05T00:13:00.000Z	blockhd		for it
2008-07-05T00:13:00.000Z	Fryguy--	blockhd	use the restricted driver from the restricted drivers manager
2008-07-05T00:13:00.000Z	Fryguy--	blockhd	yes
2008-07-05T00:13:00.000Z	Fryguy--	blockhd	restricted driver is probably the best.  Both are available and easy to install, so why not try both?
2008-07-05T00:14:00.000Z	Fryguy--	blockhd	you obviously have some idea since you've tracked these drivers down
2008-07-05T00:14:00.000Z	blockhd	Fryguy--	true
2008-07-05T00:14:00.000Z	Fryguy--	blockhd	i'm telling you that the restricted driver is probably the best choice.  There's plenty of documentation available for installing other drivers, you are free to change it and experiment if you want
2008-07-05T00:20:00.000Z	Fryguy--	blockhd	as far as I know, the only easy to use sensitivity settings are in the mouse panel in the menu.  If you need more advanced configuration of your mouse, you'll have to consult the documentation for X and put the appropriate configuration into xorg.conf
2008-07-05T00:26:00.000Z	Fryguy--	blockhd	i recommend using smplayer
2008-07-05T00:26:00.000Z	Fryguy--	blockhd	it uses QT libs, but it's really a nice media player
2008-07-05T00:27:00.000Z	Fryguy--	blockhd	it is, and no i don't use it to play music
2008-07-05T00:27:00.000Z	Fryguy--	blockhd	i don't use ubuntu
2008-07-05T00:28:00.000Z	Fryguy--	blockhd	you asked for media player, so I gave a recommendation
2008-07-05T00:28:00.000Z	Fryguy--	blockhd	i use smplayer and foobar2000 on windows for media playback (smplayer for video, foobar for audio)
2008-07-05T00:59:00.000Z	Fryguy--	blockhd	?
