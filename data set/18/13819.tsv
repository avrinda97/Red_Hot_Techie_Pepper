2005-10-27T06:00:00.000Z	r0xoR		[maven] , no
2005-10-27T06:00:00.000Z	r0xoR		[maven] , the speed you got is the speed you get
2005-10-27T06:00:00.000Z	r0xoR		[maven] , unfortunately that's the way it works atm
2005-10-27T06:01:00.000Z	r0xoR		[maven] , yeah, it sux... i've got a razer boomslang and it defaults to 1600 DPI which is fuckin enormous and it's WAY too fast... but there's nothin i can do afaik
2005-10-27T06:03:00.000Z	r0xoR		[maven] , ahhh, yeah you're stuck with the high resolution until razer makes a linux driver
2005-10-27T06:04:00.000Z	r0xoR		NixNewby... you said you wanted to format a DVDRW
2005-10-27T06:06:00.000Z	r0xoR		not sure why you need the DVD to install it - you can burn a CD of the install just fine
2005-10-27T06:06:00.000Z	r0xoR		NixNewby... aight whatever man - you just propagated your own lack of help
