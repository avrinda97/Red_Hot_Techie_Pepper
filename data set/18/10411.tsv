2012-07-06T20:30:00.000Z	dougb		i am trying to create a folder that anyone in the www-data group can write to, when i create the folder it shows 'doug doug' which i assume means only i can write to it, when i want it to be 'doug www-data'
2012-07-06T20:30:00.000Z	dougb		is there anyway to make that happen?
2012-07-06T20:32:00.000Z	wylde	dougb	'chown doug:www-data /path/to/directory' then 'chmod 0770 /path/to/directory' or 0775 if you want it world readable.
2012-07-06T20:33:00.000Z	wylde		!permission | dougb
2012-07-06T20:33:00.000Z	dougb		thanks wylde, that worked.  is it possible for it always to write as the www-data group? we don't want to have to do this everytime we copy files over
2012-07-06T20:34:00.000Z	dougb		cool, i'll read up on that
2012-07-06T20:35:00.000Z	wylde	dougb	anything written in that directory should be available to anyone who can  read/modify/write files
2012-07-06T20:35:00.000Z	wylde		including www-data*
2012-07-06T20:36:00.000Z	dougb	wylde	i wrote a file with my user, and it says 'doug doug' for the user/group settings when i do ls -l, and then when another user tries to open it, nano says 'Warning: No write permission'
2012-07-06T20:37:00.000Z	wylde	dougb	ahh I see, then I suppose you will need to add them to the www-data group
2012-07-06T20:37:00.000Z	dougb	wylde	they are, when i run group 'username' it shows they are both in the www-data group
2012-07-06T20:37:00.000Z	dougb		do i need to reboot the computer before the changes stick?
2012-07-06T20:38:00.000Z	wylde	dougb	you shouldn't no
2012-07-06T20:38:00.000Z	wylde	dougb	hmmm moment.
2012-07-06T20:38:00.000Z	dougb		ok thanks wylde
2012-07-06T20:40:00.000Z	wylde	dougb	I suppose then, maybe www-data should own the directory. Then all users that need to write would be in the www-data group.
2012-07-06T20:40:00.000Z	wylde	dougb	'chown www-data:www-data /path/to/directory' perhaps.
2012-07-06T20:41:00.000Z	wylde	dougb	sorry but I have to run for a bit. I hope that solves your issue. If not there's some very knowledgable people in here that can help I'm sure. :)
