2005-07-04T16:48:00.000Z	sara_poo		I have a brand new amd64 ubuntu install, and X won't work, and I never set a root password.  I didn't expect this.  What did I miss?
2005-07-04T16:49:00.000Z	puddleboy	sara_poo	there is no root password in ubuntu
2005-07-04T16:49:00.000Z	puddleboy	sara_poo	 you have to use sudo
2005-07-04T16:49:00.000Z	puddleboy	sara_poo	and your current user password
2005-07-04T16:49:00.000Z	sara_poo	puddleboy	heh, interesting.  Ok i'll give it a shot.  I'm already in sudoers?
2005-07-04T16:59:00.000Z	sara_poo	puddleboy	i have
2005-07-04T05:00:00.000Z	puddleboy	sara_poo	how long does it take
2005-07-04T05:00:00.000Z	puddleboy	sara_poo	its been sitting at Uncompressing Unreal..... for a while now
2005-07-04T05:00:00.000Z	sara_poo	puddleboy	it only took about an hour to d/l and install with gentoo, you'll have to get the linux binaries from the site i think with ubunut
2005-07-04T05:00:00.000Z	puddleboy	sara_poo	I already have the ut-install.run file
2005-07-04T05:01:00.000Z	puddleboy	sara_poo	im referring to the actual installation program
2005-07-04T05:01:00.000Z	puddleboy	sara_poo	how long does it take to install
2005-07-04T05:01:00.000Z	sara_poo	puddleboy	uncompressing for awhile?  that took my system literally 10 seconds...
2005-07-04T05:01:00.000Z	puddleboy	sara_poo	weird
2005-07-04T05:01:00.000Z	sara_poo	puddleboy	it should have the 'dots' as a progress meeter thing
2005-07-04T05:01:00.000Z	puddleboy	sara_poo	something must be amiss in that case
2005-07-04T05:01:00.000Z	sara_poo	puddleboy	if it's uncompressing top should show it using some cpu % i woudl think
2005-07-04T05:01:00.000Z	sara_poo	puddleboy	you sure the install file is valid?
