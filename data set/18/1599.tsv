2011-03-10T17:04:00.000Z	schnuffle	wewe	you can use setuid but you should know what you're doing cause it's a potential security risk
2011-03-10T17:08:00.000Z	schnuffle	wewe	yes there is but as I told you, be sure you know what you do: chown root <program> && chmod u+s <program>
2011-03-10T17:09:00.000Z	schnuffle	wewe	yes
2011-03-10T17:14:00.000Z	wewe	schnuffle	i did it , but it does not work as root
2011-03-10T17:14:00.000Z	schnuffle	wewe	what does not work, show a ls -l <program>
2011-03-10T17:16:00.000Z	schnuffle	wewe	show a ls -l GNS3.desktop
2011-03-10T17:20:00.000Z	schnuffle	wewe	 .desktop is not binary, paste the conntent of te file to pastebin
2011-03-10T17:21:00.000Z	wewe	schnuffle	 so i need to go tot it's file and do the command again
2011-03-10T17:21:00.000Z	schnuffle	wewe	so how do you start your app
2011-03-10T17:24:00.000Z	schnuffle	wewe	so you do the commands on the binary you ut in /opt
2011-03-10T17:28:00.000Z	wewe	schnuffle	i did it in the file but still it dose not work
2011-03-10T17:28:00.000Z	schnuffle	wewe	can you be more precise about what is not working?
