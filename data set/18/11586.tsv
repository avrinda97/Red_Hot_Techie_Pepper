2007-01-27T17:57:00.000Z	gezzabob		there is no root password as default for root on ubuntu gably
2007-01-27T17:58:00.000Z	gezzabob		when asked for a password in ubuntu put YOUR password in gably
2007-01-27T17:59:00.000Z	gezzabob		bye gably
2007-01-27T06:00:00.000Z	gezzabob		they running Ubuntu on this old 500mhz toshiba pro 4200 laptop is a tad slow lol
2007-01-27T06:02:00.000Z	gezzabob		do you guys think running xfce or fluxbox instead of gnome help on a toshiba satillite 4200 500mhz 128mg ram be better ?
2007-01-27T06:02:00.000Z	aoupi	gezzabob	try xubuntu or fluxbuntu(very beta)
2007-01-27T06:02:00.000Z	aoupi	gezzabob	it will be much faster
2007-01-27T06:03:00.000Z	aoupi	gezzabob	I used to run fluxbox on a 233Mhz 94M RAM it was actuay usable :)
2007-01-27T06:08:00.000Z	aoupi	gezzabob	ps aux | grep [gG] nome | awk '{ print $4 }' and add by hand :)
2007-01-27T06:09:00.000Z	aoupi	gezzabob	but that only shows apps with gnome in their name, most are called gSomething i think
2007-01-27T06:12:00.000Z	aoupi	gezzabob	but  you can't really compare memory usage just like that, since the linux philosophy is unused RAM is wasted RAM
2007-01-27T06:14:00.000Z	aoupi	gezzabob	well numbers don't say much, try fluxbox and see if it feels faster
2007-01-27T06:15:00.000Z	aoupi	gezzabob	which it will :)
