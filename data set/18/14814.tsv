2005-06-10T10:07:00.000Z	jasmuz	sevets	gftp
2005-06-12T12:07:00.000Z	jasmuz	sevets	is your drive already mounted?
2005-06-12T12:08:00.000Z	sevets	jasmuz	no, how do I mount it?
2005-06-12T12:09:00.000Z	jasmuz	sevets	sudo mount /dev/hd /mount point    (do refer the hd block hda, hdb or hdc, and the place to mount it
2005-06-12T12:11:00.000Z	sevets	jasmuz	if it is NTFS formated it will mount as read only?
2005-06-12T12:12:00.000Z	jasmuz	sevets	yes..
2005-06-12T12:13:00.000Z	jasmuz	sevets	its not good to mount it in /
2005-06-12T12:16:00.000Z	sevets	jasmuz	how do I remove a mount point?
2005-06-12T12:17:00.000Z	jasmuz	sevets	rephrase that question please
2005-06-12T12:18:00.000Z	sevets	jasmuz	I mounted hdb the first time and then I mounted it in a /media folder like you said and now there are two mount points for /dev/hdb
2005-06-12T12:19:00.000Z	jasmuz	sevets	do this to only mount what you have in /etc/fstab, # sudo mount -a
2005-06-12T12:19:00.000Z	jasmuz	sevets	and then mount the other disk to the mount point
2005-06-12T12:23:00.000Z	jasmuz	sevets	you should know which is a HD and wich is a CDROM
2005-06-12T12:23:00.000Z	sevets	jasmuz	I thought that hd designation refered to hard drives not any drive
2005-06-12T12:24:00.000Z	jasmuz	sevets	HDx refers to block units....meaning Disk drives, Cdroms, etc
2005-06-12T12:25:00.000Z	jasmuz	sevets	havent you solved your problem?
