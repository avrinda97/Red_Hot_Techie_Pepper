2011-10-15T19:53:00.000Z	arc_nit_india		i need help
2011-10-15T19:55:00.000Z	deebee	arc_nit_india	did you try running 'make prerequisites' as that error is suggesting you do?
2011-10-15T19:56:00.000Z	deebee	arc_nit_india	please *do not* paste multiple lines of error text in the channel. Please use a pastebin
2011-10-15T19:59:00.000Z	deebee	arc_nit_india	it's very easy to use, just paste the text into the web page and post the link to it in here - http://paste.ubuntu.com/
2011-10-15T20:01:00.000Z	arc_nit_india	deebee	im developing customised ubuntu so i want to compile wubi to integreate into it ...do u know how to do it???
2011-10-15T20:02:00.000Z	deebee	arc_nit_india	No, it's not something I've done. I was just pointing you to use pastebin so it'll be more likely you'll get help from others
2011-10-15T20:03:00.000Z	deebee	arc_nit_india	I can't help you but others might be able to
2011-10-15T20:08:00.000Z	deebee	arc_nit_india	explain what you have tried so far, and exactly what is going wrong. Use pastebin to provide errors/output from any commands you have tried. It will be more likely you will get help that way
2011-10-15T20:12:00.000Z	arc_nit_india	deebee	i have read one tutorial from forum http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1062504 and its for hardy and when i compile it using make command than i tried make prere...that u said but it gives error of wineprefixcreate not found error
2011-10-15T20:13:00.000Z	deebee	arc_nit_india	don't ask me, ask the whole channel :) Explain everything in one single message to the whole channel. If you don't get any help, wait a while and repeat it.
2011-10-15T20:17:00.000Z	deebee	arc_nit_india	That's better, but include a pastebin with the exact errors you are getting so people can read it
2011-10-15T20:20:00.000Z	deebee	arc_nit_india	What you just did was correct :)
