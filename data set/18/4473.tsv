2009-04-17T05:26:00.000Z	Ripzerskins		Hi. Is anyone else having troubles with firefox after that last update?
2009-04-17T05:28:00.000Z	Ripzerskins		Guess not. after the most recent update (just updated) my firefox has been sketchy. Not loading bookmarks or any preferences. I can still see them if I type the beginning of one of my book marks into the address bar, but can't see them in my bookmark tab. Still can travel the web. Anyone know what happened?
2009-04-17T05:30:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	Ripzerskins	Try Right-Click on the navigation bar -->Customize... --> Restore Default Set.  I think your GUI went out of wacky.  If that doesn't work, then I don't know.
2009-04-17T05:35:00.000Z	Ripzerskins	mobi-sheep	I just did that
2009-04-17T05:36:00.000Z	Ripzerskins	mobi-sheep	It worked for a second, then firefox crashed
2009-04-17T05:37:00.000Z	Ripzerskins	mobi-sheep	Also, whenever I try to use foxmarks (or x marks now I guess) it closes.
2009-04-17T05:37:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	Ripzerskins	Hmm.  Well, I solved your issue.  And now you have a new issue. :-\
2009-04-17T05:37:00.000Z	Ripzerskins	mobi-sheep	It went back the way it was
2009-04-17T05:37:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	Ripzerskins	Try and disable Foxmarks.
2009-04-17T05:38:00.000Z	Ripzerskins	mobi-sheep	I tried to go into my addon menu and firefox closed.
2009-04-17T05:38:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	Ripzerskins	"firefox -safe-mode"
2009-04-17T05:39:00.000Z	Ripzerskins	mobi-sheep	same problem with the bookmarks. The add on isn't here though
2009-04-17T05:39:00.000Z	Ripzerskins	mobi-sheep	Closed when I tried to go into my addons
2009-04-17T05:39:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	Ripzerskins	Sounds like Foxmark b0rked your Firefox.
2009-04-17T05:40:00.000Z	Ripzerskins	mobi-sheep	Where is the bookmarks folder so I can get my bookmarks before I clean install firefox?
2009-04-17T05:42:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	Ripzerskins	Try search somewhere in /home/Rip/.mozilla/    --->  However, I suggest you to rename /home/Rip/.mozilla_backup/ --> This way, you can start Firefox with a clean config file.
2009-04-17T05:48:00.000Z	Ripzerskins	mobi-sheep	I'm totally out of hd space. Think that might be my problem? haha
2009-04-17T05:49:00.000Z	mobi-sheep	Ripzerskins	I wouldn't know how Firefox manage with no room.  Could be.  Would be.  Should be.
