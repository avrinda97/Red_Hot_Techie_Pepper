2006-10-09T11:42:00.000Z	mAIJK		Should I use nvidia-glx-legacy or nvidia-glx to my GeForce 7600GT for gaming or should I use the driver from NVIDIAs Homepage????
2006-10-09T11:42:00.000Z	Terminus	mAIJK	nvidia-glx
2006-10-09T11:43:00.000Z	mAIJK	Terminus	is that one as good as Nvidia.coms detonator?
2006-10-09T11:43:00.000Z	Terminus	mAIJK	yep. and too make things simple, always grab packages from the repos first before installing from other sources. makes cleanup easy.
2006-10-09T11:43:00.000Z	Terminus	mAIJK	if you really are forced to install from another source, use checkinstall.
2006-10-09T12:01:00.000Z	Terminus	mAIJK	run glxgears
2006-10-09T12:02:00.000Z	mAIJK	Terminus	Xlib:  extension "GLX" missing on display ":0.0".
2006-10-09T12:02:00.000Z	Terminus	mAIJK	doesn't sound like it's working right then.
2006-10-09T12:03:00.000Z	Terminus	mAIJK	you did reboot after installing the kernel driver and X driver right?
2006-10-09T12:04:00.000Z	mAIJK	Terminus	nvidia-glx and nvidia-glx-dev is the one I need, not more then that???
2006-10-09T12:04:00.000Z	Terminus	mAIJK	it should be. and nvidia-glx-dev isn't even needed. something else must be wrong.
2006-10-09T12:05:00.000Z	Terminus	mAIJK	but you still have X running? check your xorg.conf and see if it's using nvidia and not nv. that might be the problem.
2006-10-09T12:34:00.000Z	mAIJK	Terminus	 when I change to driver "nvidia" then Xserver cant load
2006-10-09T12:35:00.000Z	Terminus	mAIJK	if you're using the nvidia driver, make sure that glx is loaded and dri and GLCore are NOT loaded.
2006-10-09T12:36:00.000Z	mAIJK	Terminus	"dri" is loaded... I made a bracket before it now
2006-10-09T12:37:00.000Z	Terminus	mAIJK	just comment it out.
2006-10-09T12:50:00.000Z	mAIJK	Terminus	I changed to nvidia and I did not get get an X error but My display say  "check signal cable"
2006-10-09T12:51:00.000Z	mAIJK	Terminus	 I use same Depth and Mode that works with my nv driver
