2011-12-13T14:26:00.000Z	woogi		it just says make startup disk
2011-12-13T14:27:00.000Z	woogi		i'm trying to make a startup disk so i can install ubuntu as my sole os. no more windows!
2011-12-13T14:28:00.000Z	woogi		i have it installed, am running it now
2011-12-13T14:29:00.000Z	woogi		but the ubuntu site insrtucts that I can burn a startup disk , reboot and have the sd format my hd and install ubuntu as my one and only os

2011-12-13T14:31:00.000Z	Gentoo64	woogi	wipe it thtne...
2011-12-13T14:32:00.000Z	Gentoo64	woogi	do you want cd or usb
2011-12-13T14:33:00.000Z	Gentoo64	woogi	i think unetbooting is the most common one, although they should all work
2011-12-13T14:37:00.000Z	Gentoo64	woogi	if you have a cd drive and a cd / dvd. use that its more reliable
2011-12-13T14:39:00.000Z	Gentoo64	woogi	with a cd / dvd it does
2011-12-13T14:40:00.000Z	Gentoo64	woogi	burn the iso to dvd, boot the dvd and itll run ubuntu from ram, and you can install it while its running
2011-12-13T14:41:00.000Z	Gentoo64	woogi	on windows when you boot the dvd, it runs the setup. on most linux it runs the actual os straight away
2011-12-13T14:43:00.000Z	Gentoo64	woogi	well you know what to do
