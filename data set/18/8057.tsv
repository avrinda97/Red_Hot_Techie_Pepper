2007-10-08T15:37:00.000Z	ikonia	jeff1212	you scanning your ports is something different to someone externally scanning your ports also, keep that in mind
2007-10-08T15:37:00.000Z	jeff1212	ikonia	 i done something to scan but locked mu comp up
2007-10-08T15:38:00.000Z	ikonia	jeff1212	it will make your machine quiet busy, more so if your scanning locally

2007-10-08T16:09:00.000Z	ikonia	jeff1212	is there anything in the url that concerns you
2007-10-08T16:11:00.000Z	jeff1212	ikonia	 all the unknown and open
2007-10-08T16:11:00.000Z	ikonia	jeff1212	just means your box is responding with "something" locally
2007-10-08T16:11:00.000Z	ikonia	jeff1212	whats more important is what is open to the internet or network you don't want to access your machine
