2008-10-15T18:08:00.000Z	jrib	phaidros	sun doesn't make one.  The bug on their tracker is several years old.  use an open java plugin like gcjwebplugin or install 32bit firefox (see !flash64)
2008-10-15T18:08:00.000Z	phaidros		so, any hint how to get a remote kvm java console running in browser without having sun java ? (icedtea doesn't do)

2008-10-15T18:10:00.000Z	jrib	phaidros	not really, you just download the tarball, extract somewhere and copy whatever plugins you want, and create some symlinks
