2006-08-27T10:54:00.000Z	thybo		hello;)
2006-08-27T10:54:00.000Z	thybo		i have an ATI Mobility Radeon 16MB
2006-08-27T10:55:00.000Z	thybo		are the ati drivers of any help for better performance?
2006-08-27T10:55:00.000Z	thybo		even for such a small card?
2006-08-27T10:55:00.000Z	Melinda	thybo	edit your xorg.conf and use "radeon"
2006-08-27T10:56:00.000Z	Melinda	thybo	yes
2006-08-27T11:00:00.000Z	Melinda	thybo	 yes
2006-08-27T11:01:00.000Z	Melinda	thybo	 no you never need to reboot -ctrl-alt-bacspace
2006-08-27T11:07:00.000Z	Melinda	thybo	Because WINE is an emulation of windows ;)
2006-08-27T11:07:00.000Z	Melinda	thybo	Yeah usually unless you have an uber fast PC :)
2006-08-27T11:08:00.000Z	Melinda	thybo	Slow down on wine in games is common it is emulation.. so you can expect that to happen
2006-08-27T11:09:00.000Z	Melinda	thybo	reducing your load may improve it - close all "windows" before running your wine games - should help a little bit
2006-08-27T11:10:00.000Z	Melinda	thybo	Not if it's 3d emulation made for windows no - however the slowdown will not be as noticed for linux specific apps - HOWEVER the radeon driver for Linux is slower then it's windows counterpart. - flgrx is quicker but only supports recent cards.
2006-08-27T11:14:00.000Z	Melinda	thybo	Wine cannot run everything ;) - it is probably complaining about a device driver or port it cannot open - and it probably cannot run under wine
2006-08-27T11:15:00.000Z	Melinda	thybo	Probably not - however is your voip software listed in the wine db? - I doubt it will run in Linux/WINE
2006-08-27T11:15:00.000Z	Melinda	thybo	You should fine a Linux specific voip replacement
2006-08-27T11:27:00.000Z	Melinda	thybo	Well I wanted to know if Opera removed its "chat" function ?
2006-08-27T11:37:00.000Z	Melinda	thybo	Later thybo
