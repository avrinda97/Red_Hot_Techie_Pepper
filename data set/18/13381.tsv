2005-12-23T08:29:00.000Z	rraajj	james	Have you extracted it yet?
2005-12-23T08:30:00.000Z	rraajj	james	Yes. If it's a BZ2 Ball, tar jxvf filename.tar.bz2
2005-12-23T08:31:00.000Z	rraajj	james	You could go into the desktop directory. cd Desktop/
2005-12-23T08:33:00.000Z	rraajj	james	Just a .gz? No .tar?
2005-12-23T08:33:00.000Z	rraajj	james	If it's just in .gz, I think it's gunzip.
2005-12-23T08:34:00.000Z	rraajj	james	then follow Ed-Gein or tiglionabbit 's instructions. :)
2005-12-23T08:42:00.000Z	rraajj	james	You'll have to compile it first before installing.
2005-12-23T08:42:00.000Z	rraajj	james	./configure first. If it didn't spit out any errors, compile it with 'make'.
2005-12-23T08:47:00.000Z	rraajj	james	Is there even a configure file inside the directory?
2005-12-23T08:54:00.000Z	rraajj	james	You just need the GNU development tools.
