2009-04-22T16:03:00.000Z	joaopinto	pragad7	it depends on how it's "broken"
2009-04-22T16:05:00.000Z	joaopinto	pragad7	does the system boot normally, but then you get a black screen when it gets into the graphical login ?
2009-04-22T16:06:00.000Z	joaopinto	pragad7	most likely it's something set on your X session startup
2009-04-22T16:07:00.000Z	joaopinto	pragad7	in your case I would create a new user, and see if you can login with it properly
2009-04-22T16:07:00.000Z	joaopinto	pragad7	when you login, several applications are loaded according to the user settings/config
2009-04-22T16:08:00.000Z	joaopinto	pragad7	switch to a text console with: ctrl -alt-f1
2009-04-22T16:09:00.000Z	pragad7	joaopinto	dont have much time after logging in it goes black in 2 secs
2009-04-22T16:09:00.000Z	joaopinto	pragad7	do not login
2009-04-22T16:11:00.000Z	joaopinto	pragad7	repair will not fix a user config related problem, which seems to be your case
2009-04-22T17:37:00.000Z	joaopinto	pragad7	usermod -G admin -a test
2009-04-22T17:38:00.000Z	joaopinto	pragad7	admin
2009-04-22T17:40:00.000Z	pragad7	joaopinto	my ol user account is not working
2009-04-22T17:42:00.000Z	joaopinto	pragad7	yes...
2009-04-22T17:44:00.000Z	pragad7	joaopinto	though dont hink i will need to login to give the other account privilege
2009-04-22T17:44:00.000Z	joaopinto	pragad7	you need to login from the terminal with an administrative user, to grand admin to the other user
2009-04-22T17:46:00.000Z	pragad7	joaopinto	 and wgrant that solutionu suggested to me and mr-kaizer . only half worked
