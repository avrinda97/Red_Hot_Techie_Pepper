2011-07-13T12:32:00.000Z	zykotick9	th0r	~/bin would be better
2011-07-13T12:33:00.000Z	th0r	zykotick9	yes, but that won't be in the path I think
2011-07-13T12:33:00.000Z	zykotick9	th0r	actually it is
2011-07-13T12:34:00.000Z	th0r	zykotick9	ah....ubuntu I guess. running debian so my world is a bit different <smile>
2011-07-13T12:35:00.000Z	zykotick9	th0r	actually, same on Debian
2011-07-13T12:36:00.000Z	th0r	zykotick9	darn if it isn't! learn something new every day <smile>
2011-07-24T22:14:00.000Z	zykotick9	th0r	why do you give F2 as the example?  F1 is available as well.
2011-07-24T22:14:00.000Z	th0r	zykotick9	old school...F1 used to be the console
2011-07-24T22:14:00.000Z	zykotick9	th0r	i see ;)
2011-09-04T04:52:00.000Z	th0r	zykotick9	have you looked at sync via something like spideroak? I use it to sync my opera bookmarks between computers and OS's
2011-09-04T04:53:00.000Z	zykotick9	th0r	without using "the cloud"!  That key for me.  Remote sync is EASY, but personally i don't subscribe.
2011-09-04T04:53:00.000Z	th0r	zykotick9	no, admittedly it does use the cloud, but they claim everything on the server is encrypted and even they can't access it
2011-10-10T04:14:00.000Z	th0r	zykotick9	I pointed that out earlier. He is running a 64 bit system, and the deb is marked 'all'
2011-10-10T04:43:00.000Z	th0r	zykotick9	another ubuntu 'improvement'?
2011-10-10T04:43:00.000Z	zykotick9	th0r	gnome improvement - nothing to do with ubuntu
2011-10-10T04:44:00.000Z	th0r	zykotick9	indeed....I am running debian squeeze, xfce, and gdm, and I was able to change the login screen with gdmsetup
2011-10-10T04:45:00.000Z	zykotick9	th0r	you aren't using gdm3 then (NOT part of Gnome3 btw)
2011-10-10T04:45:00.000Z	th0r	zykotick9	right....gdm 2.2...learn something new every day
