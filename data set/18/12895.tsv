2008-10-05T05:15:00.000Z	alteregoa		its bunt
2008-10-05T05:15:00.000Z	alteregoa		what command is there to measure the speed troughput?
2008-10-05T05:16:00.000Z	Agent_bob	alteregoa	ping ?     copy a file and time it ?
2008-10-05T05:17:00.000Z	Agent_bob	alteregoa	what are you wanting to measure ?
2008-10-05T05:17:00.000Z	Agent_bob	alteregoa	no with an application made for that.
2008-10-05T05:18:00.000Z	Agent_bob	alteregoa	time cp my/5g/dvd.iso /new/dir
2008-10-05T05:20:00.000Z	Agent_bob	alteregoa	no time does .   shows how long it took to exec the cp command.
2008-10-05T05:20:00.000Z	Agent_bob	alteregoa	time sleep 3
2008-10-05T05:21:00.000Z	Agent_bob	alteregoa	i think there is a gtimmer app to.  have never messed with it tho
2008-10-05T05:24:00.000Z	Agent_bob	alteregoa	looks like "time" in my dapper system came from "gnome-system-tools"  in case that helps.
2008-10-05T05:26:00.000Z	Agent_bob	alteregoa	heh just happened to think,  dd reports elapsed time and data transfer too.
2008-10-05T05:28:00.000Z	Agent_bob	alteregoa	example. dd if=/dev/zero of=MBR count=2  >>> 1024 bytes (1.0 kB) copied, 0.000117 seconds, 8.8 MB/s
2008-10-05T05:46:00.000Z	Agent_bob	alteregoa	you disagree ?
2008-10-05T05:48:00.000Z	Agent_bob	alteregoa	maybe it depends on what you do with your fs ;/
2008-10-05T05:49:00.000Z	Agent_bob	alteregoa	i care.  but this is no place for a poll
2008-10-05T05:49:00.000Z	Agent_bob	alteregoa	again. i care.  but this is no place for a poll
