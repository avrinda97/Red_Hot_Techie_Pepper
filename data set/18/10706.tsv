2007-02-02T10:27:00.000Z	asc_		s/3s/32
2007-02-02T10:28:00.000Z	asc_		somebody tell me if I'm wrong
2007-02-02T10:28:00.000Z	asc_		or, "you can run everything that works on the 32 bit OS with the 32 bit processor"
2007-02-02T10:28:00.000Z	dimeo	asc_	 sound about right
2007-02-02T10:29:00.000Z	asc_	dimeo	excellent.  Any idea what the speed difference is like?
2007-02-02T10:29:00.000Z	dimeo	asc_	 I read that 64 bit was kinda behind in the repositories.... so 32 is still the way to go.. even if it's not 30% faster
2007-02-02T10:31:00.000Z	asc_	dimeo	thanks
2007-02-02T10:33:00.000Z	dimeo	asc_	more screen space = virtual desktops... ?
2007-02-02T10:33:00.000Z	asc_	dimeo	Oh.  Synonym for workspaces.
2007-02-02T10:38:00.000Z	dimeo	asc_	good question.. I find edgy cycled 50% between my Duo core2
2007-02-02T10:39:00.000Z	asc_	dimeo	could you expand on that explanation a bit?
2007-02-02T10:41:00.000Z	dimeo	asc_	well when I run the system monitor to see how much CPU my program is eating up... it's never using both processors at 100%.. and it gets me wondering if things are running slower than they could be
2007-02-02T10:42:00.000Z	asc_	dimeo	Okay, I get it now.  Thanks.
2007-02-02T10:56:00.000Z	dimeo	asc_	there's this dude I read about on hackaday... he joined together like 12 minimacs into one supercomputer.. beats a quadcore!
2007-02-02T10:57:00.000Z	asc_	dimeo	Well, I'm also looking at a supercomputer that you can order cases of 144 processors each
2007-02-02T10:57:00.000Z	asc_	dimeo	But the price is 'if you have to ask, you can't afford it'
2007-02-02T12:36:00.000Z	dimeo	asc_	I recall having the same confusion.. windows *seemed* easier cause it had c:/ drive and the disk was a:/
