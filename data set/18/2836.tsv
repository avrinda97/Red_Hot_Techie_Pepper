2010-05-08T23:38:00.000Z	delemi	minimec	in 10.04 on the top task bar System/Admin/System Testing\
2010-05-08T23:39:00.000Z	minimec	delemi	Why are you talking to  me?
2010-05-08T23:39:00.000Z	delemi	minimec	you were talking about compiz
2010-05-08T23:40:00.000Z	minimec	delemi	I use e17... I was helping other people.
2010-05-08T23:41:00.000Z	delemi	minimec	My mistake I came into the chat a little late
2010-05-08T23:41:00.000Z	minimec	delemi	;)
2010-05-08T23:41:00.000Z	delemi	minimec	how do you like E17?
2010-05-08T23:42:00.000Z	minimec	delemi	I love it for years. I am using it in two dual screen computer setups. It is a the perfect solution for a dual screen setup.
2010-05-08T23:48:00.000Z	minimec	delemi	It is definitly worth a try. I don't use the ecomorph compiz version. Just clean good e17 ;)
2010-05-08T23:50:00.000Z	minimec	delemi	TAke yourself some time to explore e17. It is really complex for configuration, as you can almost do anything...
2010-05-08T23:50:00.000Z	delemi	minimec	what kernal is e17 running?
2010-05-08T23:51:00.000Z	minimec	delemi	YOu can run your normal ubuntu 10.04 install. You only need to install the WindoMAnager e17. There are different ways to do that.
2010-05-08T23:56:00.000Z	minimec	delemi	VCoolio Probalby as VCoolio I tell you. Try e17 without ecomorph first. ;)
2010-05-08T23:58:00.000Z	delemi	minimec	thanks for the advise, I work for cell one of east texas and we run a lot of *nix servers. Always fun to learn something new.
2010-05-08T23:59:00.000Z	minimec	delemi	Linux is fun, right ;)
2010-05-08T23:59:00.000Z	delemi	minimec	makes me use my brain. makes me remeber all the programing classes I had.
