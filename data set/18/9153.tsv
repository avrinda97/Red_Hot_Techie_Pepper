2007-08-15T13:44:00.000Z	joakim		coming in october, (thus 7.10)
2007-08-15T13:44:00.000Z	joakim		not even
2007-08-15T13:44:00.000Z	joakim		alpha
2007-08-15T13:45:00.000Z	joakim		#eclipse maybe?
2007-08-15T13:45:00.000Z	rbanff1	joakim	But it works fine under Feisty
2007-08-15T13:46:00.000Z	joakim		could be because gutsy is alpha rbanff1..
2007-08-15T13:46:00.000Z	rbanff1	joakim	My Feisty notebook got stolen today. I am stuck, for now, with a Gutsy one.
2007-08-15T13:46:00.000Z	joakim		and the version of eclipse for alpha might be alpha too
2007-08-15T13:46:00.000Z	joakim		sad to hear that rbanff1
2007-08-15T13:50:00.000Z	joakim	wers	ManDVD or one of those programs?
2007-08-15T13:50:00.000Z	joakim		there's a bunch of them.. check kde-apps.org, they're top score there
2007-08-15T13:51:00.000Z	rbanff1	joakim	I know. Thanks. Anyway, piling up alpha release on top of alpha release will most probably result in a exeedingly adventurous setup. I will probably have to go the Feisty route
