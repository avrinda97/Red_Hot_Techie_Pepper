2006-12-18T15:01:00.000Z	curs0r	brandon__	i bought an audigy4 for that same reason
2006-12-18T15:03:00.000Z	curs0r	brandon__	creative makes pcmcia cards
2006-12-18T15:04:00.000Z	curs0r	brandon__	as well as external usb devices
2006-12-18T15:05:00.000Z	curs0r	brandon__	i have been through 4 or 5 boards through the Intel/Nvidia/Realtek audio thing and i never got one going right
2006-12-18T15:06:00.000Z	curs0r	brandon__	usually i got them working to some extent but they were usually pretty unstable
2006-12-18T15:07:00.000Z	curs0r	brandon__	this audigy was $30 and the only setting i had to tweak was the volume ;)
2006-12-18T15:08:00.000Z	curs0r	brandon__	if that concerns you a lot you might consider usb
2006-12-18T15:09:00.000Z	curs0r	brandon__	those usually have some realtek model number counterpart
2006-12-18T15:09:00.000Z	brandon__	curs0r	stac92xx
2006-12-18T15:12:00.000Z	curs0r	brandon__	what drivers have you tried with that?
2006-12-18T15:47:00.000Z	curs0r	brandon__	it works?
2006-12-18T15:48:00.000Z	brandon__	curs0r	nope
