2011-03-24T20:30:00.000Z	BabyGirl		whats in group , adm ?
2011-03-24T20:31:00.000Z	maco	BabyGirl	i think its that users in adm can read logs and ones in admin can use sudo
2011-03-24T20:32:00.000Z	maco	BabyGirl	grep "adm:" /etc/group        to see who's in adm
2011-03-24T20:34:00.000Z	maco	BabyGirl	the grep or oCean's getent were for seeing who's in each group. i have no idea what you mean about "the manage"
2011-03-24T20:35:00.000Z	maco	BabyGirl	they dont "Manage" anything
2011-03-24T20:35:00.000Z	maco	BabyGirl	they are simply for file permissions
2011-03-24T20:44:00.000Z	maco	BabyGirl	do you have autologin turned on?
2011-03-24T20:36:00.000Z	maco	BabyGirl	if you do "ls -l filename" you can see which group has access to the file
2011-03-24T20:36:00.000Z	maco	BabyGirl	its in the 4th column
2011-03-24T20:39:00.000Z	maco	BabyGirl	there's no keyring group. the keyring is a per-user thing
2011-03-24T20:40:00.000Z	maco	BabyGirl	the keyring is encrypted. nothing can access its contents until you have typed in your password once, unless you set no password for it, which would make all your password stored in plaintext on your disk in a very insecure fashion
2011-03-24T20:40:00.000Z	maco	BabyGirl	if you set your login password & keyring password to the same, the act of typing in your password to login should unlock the keyring though
2011-03-24T20:44:00.000Z	maco	BabyGirl	that wouldnt be in users & groups, itd be in the login settings
2011-03-24T20:52:00.000Z	maco	BabyGirl	did you get the login screen?
2011-03-24T20:53:00.000Z	maco	BabyGirl	in the keyring settings software (it's called Seahorse and was in Applications -> Accessories but idk if it still is... you can just run "seahorse") make sure your keyring password matches your login password
2011-03-24T21:07:00.000Z	maco	BabyGirl	you can just get rid of the keyring
2011-03-24T21:07:00.000Z	maco	BabyGirl	in that case, they should each ask for the password every time you use them
2011-03-24T21:08:00.000Z	maco	BabyGirl	or you could set the keyring's password to be blank, which would mean your gwibber & empathy passwords are stored in plain text and anyone with access to your computer can find them, assuming you have not encrypted your hard drive (in which case, they'd still be mostly safe)
