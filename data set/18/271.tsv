2012-05-09T16:49:00.000Z	djszapi|tb		Hey! I have just installed the stock ubuntu 12.04 LTS, but I cannot seem to find the "wacom" packages after executing the "apt-cache search wacom" command. How shall I extend the default sources.list I have right after the installation ?
2012-05-09T16:50:00.000Z	djszapi|tb		these packages: http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=wacom&searchon=names&suite=precise&section=all
2012-05-09T16:50:00.000Z	djszapi|tb		the current sources.list is incapable for that
2012-05-09T16:50:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	djszapi|tb	run "sudo apt-get update" first
2012-05-09T16:52:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	djszapi|tb	run "sudo apt-get update" first
2012-05-09T16:53:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	djszapi|tb	sorry, wrong person
2012-05-09T16:53:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	djszapi|tb	nvm, right person, it appears you asked 2 questions :P
2012-05-09T16:53:00.000Z	djszapi|tb	DarwinSurvivor	huh ?
2012-05-09T16:54:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	djszapi|tb	you asked about wacom *and* audio stuff :P
2012-05-09T16:56:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	djszapi|tb	did you run "sudo apt-get update" before running "apt-cache search wacom"?
2012-05-09T16:57:00.000Z	djszapi|tb	DarwinSurvivor	like I wrote many times, yes, quite a few times...
2012-05-09T16:57:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	djszapi|tb	sorry, my bad
2012-05-09T16:59:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	djszapi|tb	have you tried using the tablet without installing anything? I think it's been embedded into the kernel now
2012-05-09T17:00:00.000Z	djszapi|tb	DarwinSurvivor	yes of course
2012-05-09T17:00:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	djszapi|tb	it does help to prefix your message with the other person's name since most irc clients highlight messages with the persons name in it
2012-05-09T17:00:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	djszapi|tb	then what type of wacom is it?
2012-05-09T17:05:00.000Z	djszapi|tb	DarwinSurvivor	what do you mean ?
2012-05-09T17:05:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	djszapi|tb	ok, lets start from square 1. why do you need a wacom package? what is the *original* problem you are trying to solve?
