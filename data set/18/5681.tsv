2008-09-09T13:35:00.000Z	MorpheusX[NL]		goodmorning
2008-09-09T13:36:00.000Z	SegFaultAX	MorpheusX[NL]	morning!
2008-09-09T13:39:00.000Z	SegFaultAX	MorpheusX[NL]	ssh, sftp, scp, rcp, and others. alternatively you could look into setting up a temporary samba server
2008-09-09T13:40:00.000Z	SegFaultAX	MorpheusX[NL]	you could use puttysftp (http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/)
2008-09-09T13:42:00.000Z	SegFaultAX	MorpheusX[NL]	you might consider writing a script that marks files for downloading based on their last touch time
2008-09-09T13:44:00.000Z	SegFaultAX	MorpheusX[NL]	google "rsync windows client", might be a useful place to start
2008-09-09T13:46:00.000Z	SegFaultAX	MorpheusX[NL]	you might be able to setup tasks, somewhat like a crontab
2008-09-09T13:48:00.000Z	SegFaultAX	MorpheusX[NL]	DeltaCopy is a wrapper for rsync for windows, and it does incremental backups
2008-09-09T13:49:00.000Z	SegFaultAX	MorpheusX[NL]	and it may be taskable under windows
2008-09-09T13:51:00.000Z	MorpheusX[NL]	SegFaultAX	i looked at deltacopy but it demands that the app is also installed on the other side
2008-09-09T13:52:00.000Z	SegFaultAX	MorpheusX[NL]	well how big is the filesystem your syncing, and how big are the daily diffs?
2008-09-09T13:53:00.000Z	SegFaultAX	MorpheusX[NL]	and the daily diff size?
2008-09-09T13:56:00.000Z	SegFaultAX	MorpheusX[NL]	do you need to physically sync the data, or could you use the linux box as a remote file server
2008-09-09T14:24:00.000Z	MorpheusX[NL]	SegFaultAX	could use the box as remote file server
2008-09-09T14:26:00.000Z	MorpheusX[NL]	SegFaultAX	did you had an brillian idea then
2008-09-09T14:27:00.000Z	SegFaultAX	MorpheusX[NL]	perhaps setting up samba as an NFS would be better suited for your needs
2008-09-09T14:28:00.000Z	MorpheusX[NL]	SegFaultAX	i have samba installed
2008-09-09T14:32:00.000Z	MorpheusX[NL]	SegFaultAX	strange thing but it seems that deltacopy can talk with my rsync on ubuntu
