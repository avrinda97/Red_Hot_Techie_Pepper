2007-06-10T14:46:00.000Z	Flannel	raymondjtoth	Read the stuff around that.  That's not a command, that's something you need to add (the next line)
2007-06-10T15:04:00.000Z	Flannel	raymondjtoth	All that stuff is linked from https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats  search for "quicktime" on that page and you'll find it
2010-09-13T09:59:00.000Z	Flannel	raymondjtoth	I'm not sure I understand what you're asking for.  What are you looking to download?
2010-09-13T09:57:00.000Z	Flannel	raymondjtoth	#ubuntu+1
2010-09-13T09:58:00.000Z	Flannel	raymondjtoth	You mean Ubuntu 4.10?
2010-09-13T09:59:00.000Z	raymondjtoth	Flannel	 i mean can we get the first build of  ibunru with a gui and easy installer
2010-09-13T10:01:00.000Z	Flannel	raymondjtoth	You can get all the way back to 4.10, but you wouldn't want to use that today.  For an installed system, 8.04 is a likely candidate, and that'll be supported until April of next year on the desktop.
