2012-01-10T06:20:00.000Z	iceroot	largetalk	sure, buy a cpu which is supporting vt-x
2012-01-10T06:20:00.000Z	iceroot	largetalk	you cant "edit" your cpu
2012-01-10T06:21:00.000Z	largetalk	iceroot	so i can't install xen or kvm on my computer?
2012-01-10T06:21:00.000Z	iceroot	largetalk	sure you can
2012-01-10T06:21:00.000Z	iceroot	largetalk	but not all virtualisation-features will work without vt-x
2012-01-10T06:22:00.000Z	iceroot	largetalk	also have a look at #xen and #kvm
2012-01-10T06:22:00.000Z	largetalk	iceroot	ok, thanks
2012-01-10T06:23:00.000Z	largetalk	iceroot	i know my computer is old enough to die, :-D
2012-01-10T06:26:00.000Z	largetalk	iceroot	how to install xen on ubuntu? and where to download linux kernel support xen
2012-01-10T06:26:00.000Z	iceroot	largetalk	just install the xen-kernel, thats all
2012-01-10T06:29:00.000Z	iceroot	largetalk	hm i thought there is something like "linux-image-xen" but i cant find it on 12.04. maybe this is what you want xen-hypervisor-4.1-amd64
2012-01-10T06:29:00.000Z	iceroot	largetalk	or the i386 version
2012-01-10T06:31:00.000Z	iceroot	largetalk	but are you sure you want xen/kvm instead of vbox?
2012-01-10T06:32:00.000Z	largetalk	iceroot	i found ubuntu-xen-server ubuntu-xen-desktop in source, is it? btw, my server use ubuntu 10.10
2012-01-10T06:32:00.000Z	iceroot	largetalk	have a look at the link from ubottu about the xen-installation
2012-01-10T06:37:00.000Z	largetalk	iceroot	seeing, i want to lanuch lots of os on a computer in publish environment, so i think xen/kvm will better than vbox
2012-01-10T06:41:00.000Z	iceroot	largetalk	yes
