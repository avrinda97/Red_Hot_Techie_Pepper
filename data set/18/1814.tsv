2010-10-30T17:41:00.000Z	ikonia	epson	use sudo
2010-10-30T17:44:00.000Z	ikonia	epson	you shouldn 't be the root user

2010-10-30T17:46:00.000Z	ikonia	epson	because a config file is not a command
2010-10-30T17:46:00.000Z	ikonia	epson	what are you trying to do
2010-10-30T18:10:00.000Z	ikonia	epson	why do you keep typing that command

2010-10-30T18:13:00.000Z	ikonia	epson	ok, so gksudo gedit /etc/sane.d/dll.conf
2010-10-30T18:16:00.000Z	epson	ikonia	it doesn't work yet
2010-10-30T18:17:00.000Z	ikonia	epson	what do you mean it doesn't work
2010-10-30T18:17:00.000Z	epson	ikonia	it doesn't work yet i still have this:"no devices available"
2010-10-30T18:17:00.000Z	ikonia	epson	I just told you how to edit a file, not how to fix your printer
