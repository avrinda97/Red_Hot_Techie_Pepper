2009-07-25T01:44:00.000Z	soapbox		Hey when I attempt to SCP or FTP into a specific folder on my server it's telling me "no such file or directory"
2009-07-25T01:44:00.000Z	soapbox		even though very clearly both the file and the directory exist
2009-07-25T01:45:00.000Z	soapbox		i can upload to the folder's immediate parent directory no problem btw
2009-07-25T01:45:00.000Z	MaskedDriver	soapbox	permissions problem?
2009-07-25T01:46:00.000Z	MaskedDriver	soapbox	it's probably because the folder is owned by root
2009-07-25T01:46:00.000Z	MaskedDriver	soapbox	in ssh, go to that folder and do a ls -la and see who the owner is
2009-07-25T01:47:00.000Z	MaskedDriver	soapbox	you FTP in as your username... you ssh as root (which is highly unrecommended)... if your folder is owned by root you can't play around with it
2009-07-25T01:49:00.000Z	MaskedDriver	soapbox	ofc I'm right ;)
2009-07-25T01:49:00.000Z	MaskedDriver	soapbox	sudo chown username:username image_script_pics
2009-07-25T01:50:00.000Z	MaskedDriver	soapbox	the username you ftp into
2009-07-25T01:51:00.000Z	MaskedDriver	soapbox	the first bob is the user, the second bob is the group
2009-07-25T01:51:00.000Z	MaskedDriver	soapbox	exactly
2009-07-25T01:52:00.000Z	MaskedDriver	soapbox	no, you can skip sudo... but you should never log in as root... nasty things can happen
2009-07-25T01:53:00.000Z	MaskedDriver	soapbox	you can accidentally run a command that will screw up your whole system
2009-07-25T01:53:00.000Z	MaskedDriver	soapbox	sudo is the appropriate way to accomplish root commands
2009-07-25T01:56:00.000Z	MaskedDriver	soapbox	most usually your own
2009-07-25T01:57:00.000Z	MaskedDriver	soapbox	my pleasure
2009-07-25T01:58:00.000Z	MaskedDriver	soapbox	is this a web server?  because if you plan on having apache right to the server the group should be whatever group is set up for apache
