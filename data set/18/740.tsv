2011-10-02T09:32:00.000Z	pumaaaaz		i'm trying to install something but it says package architecture i386 does not match system (amd64) with dpkg is there any way to install it?
2011-10-02T09:33:00.000Z	soreau	pumaaaaz	Sounds like you're trying to install a 32bit package on a 64bit system (wont work, you need the 64bit package)
2011-10-02T09:36:00.000Z	pumaaaaz	soreau	i don't think it has a 64 bit version, theres no way to install it then eh?
2011-10-02T09:36:00.000Z	soreau	pumaaaaz	What package is it?
2011-10-02T09:38:00.000Z	pumaaaaz	soreau	its the streammygame player
2011-10-02T09:40:00.000Z	soreau	pumaaaaz	Hmm.. looks cool but I can't tell what packages they have available without an account
2011-10-02T09:42:00.000Z	pumaaaaz	soreau	oh well ;\, do you know of something better supported or free that can do the same kind of thing? :d
2011-10-02T09:42:00.000Z	soreau	pumaaaaz	Well I think it's possible to run 32bit applications on 64bit but I'm not sure of the details. I just know natively, a 32bit deb can't run on 64bit
2011-10-02T09:45:00.000Z	soreau	pumaaaaz	I don't know of any though I haven't looked
2011-10-02T09:45:00.000Z	soreau	pumaaaaz	They seem to have a legitimate site though so try contacting their support team
2011-10-02T10:02:00.000Z	pumaaaaz	soreau	they had an sh script for 'other linux' and that seems to have installed it
2011-10-02T10:03:00.000Z	soreau	pumaaaaz	cool
2011-10-02T11:04:00.000Z	soreau	pumaaaaz	huh?
2011-10-02T11:10:00.000Z	pumaaaaz	soreau	it needs firefox to handle smgp:// links
2011-10-02T11:10:00.000Z	soreau	pumaaaaz	Ahh.. you need to do stuff in about:config
2011-10-02T11:11:00.000Z	pumaaaaz	soreau	i added network.protocol-handler.app.smgp but it still isn't working ;\
2011-10-02T11:11:00.000Z	soreau	pumaaaaz	Yea I would have to try to get it working myself..
2011-10-02T11:11:00.000Z	soreau	pumaaaaz	Can I pm you?
