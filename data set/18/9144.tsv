2007-05-14T16:06:00.000Z	jendead		hello, does anyone know how to tell wine to run in 32-bit color by default?
2007-05-14T16:06:00.000Z	magnetron	jendead	wine cannot change the bit depth.
2007-05-14T16:07:00.000Z	jendead		oh.. how do people get games to work if you can't get 32 bit color?
2007-05-14T16:07:00.000Z	magnetron	jendead	you will have to set X11 to the right bit depth before you start wine
2007-05-14T16:08:00.000Z	jendead	magnetron	my desktop is running in 32 bit
2007-05-14T16:09:00.000Z	magnetron	jendead	if you don't, wine will convert the colors for you - but it will be dread slow. you might have some luck with the "emulate virtual desktop" option in winecfg
2007-05-14T16:09:00.000Z	magnetron	jendead	wait are you trying to run bf2?
2007-05-14T16:10:00.000Z	jendead	magnetron	no.. trying to run fate, old game
2007-05-14T16:10:00.000Z	magnetron	jendead	is it in the AppDB (the winehq page)
2007-05-14T16:10:00.000Z	jendead	magnetron	 i wasn't aware of an appdb, i'm new to it :)
2007-05-14T16:11:00.000Z	magnetron	jendead	http://appdb.winehq.org/
2007-05-14T16:11:00.000Z	jendead	magnetron	doesn't show up in a search :(
2007-05-14T16:11:00.000Z	magnetron	jendead	is it a dos game?
2007-05-14T16:12:00.000Z	jendead		magnetron,: no, it's a windows game. when i run it, it says "this game must be run in 16 or 32 bit color mode"
2007-05-14T16:13:00.000Z	magnetron	jendead	try to enable "emulate virtual desktop" in winecfg
2007-05-14T16:13:00.000Z	jendead	magnetron	same error message
2007-05-14T16:14:00.000Z	jendead	magnetron	it looks really ugly, like it's in 256 color mode :(
2007-05-14T16:14:00.000Z	magnetron	jendead	try to post the results in the appdb, and file a bug. that will speed up the process of making the game supported by wine
