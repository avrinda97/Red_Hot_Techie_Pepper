2007-06-05T07:11:00.000Z	frank_		if it goes on like this "uh no you have to install restricted-bad-ugly-hitler packages" I'm in the mood to make a "ubuntu-pirate-nazi-communist" edition...
2007-06-05T07:11:00.000Z	frank_		It really sucks to have 32894723947 additional "bad" things installed to make ubuntu usable for multimedia
2007-06-05T07:13:00.000Z	frank_		germany
2007-06-05T07:14:00.000Z	frank_		the university which i'm going to invented mp3 and everybody here in germany uses lame encoder without copyright issues
2007-06-05T07:14:00.000Z	frank_		(Fraunhofer university, stuttgarT)
2007-06-05T07:14:00.000Z	ewanm89	frank_	apt-get install lame?
2007-06-05T07:16:00.000Z	frank_	ewanm89	lame is already installed, but the sound-recorder doesn'T offer me to create .mp3s
2007-06-05T07:17:00.000Z	ewanm89	frank_	Save as wave, open in audacity and export as mp3 (you'll have to tell audacity where lame is in the prefrences first).
2007-06-05T07:18:00.000Z	frank_	ewanm89	I tried this but the encoding scrambles the file up, a 10sec recording has a length of 7834min
2007-06-05T07:18:00.000Z	ewanm89	frank_	What bitrate did you record it at?
2007-06-05T07:19:00.000Z	frank_	ewanm89	i used the default settings, no idea
2007-06-05T07:20:00.000Z	ewanm89	frank_	Who big is the .wav?
2007-06-05T07:22:00.000Z	ewanm89	frank_	Could you send it to me (/dcc send /path/to/file)?
2007-06-05T07:23:00.000Z	frank_	ewanm89	eh one sec, i already deleted the recording and my brother theft my headset, but this afternoon i'll have it back
2007-06-05T07:23:00.000Z	frank_	ewanm89	are you regularly here in this channel?
2007-06-05T07:24:00.000Z	ewanm89	frank_	Yes, but I suggest recording it in audacity in the first place.
2007-06-05T07:24:00.000Z	frank_	ewanm89	alright, thank you. I'll come back to you, ok?
2007-06-05T07:25:00.000Z	ewanm89	frank_	If I'm still around.
