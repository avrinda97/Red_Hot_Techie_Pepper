2010-01-22T13:49:00.000Z	tarzeau_		is anyone able to install a gdm theme for 2.28 gdm on karmic?
2010-01-22T13:49:00.000Z	tarzeau_		how?
2010-01-22T13:49:00.000Z	tarzeau_		i get the theme.tar.gz put it in /usr/share/themes
2010-01-22T13:50:00.000Z	tarzeau_		use the sudo -u gdm gconftool-2 -t string -s /apps/metacity/general/theme "Gnome Black"
2010-01-22T13:50:00.000Z	tarzeau_		commands, but it just doesn't use it
2010-01-22T13:50:00.000Z	tarzeau_		it drives me nuts. xdm, wdm is so easy to configure. why is gnome so damn hard?
2010-01-22T13:51:00.000Z	tarzeau_		how does gnome/ubuntu plan to succeed in a business/enterprise place where 100 or 1000 desktops exist
2010-01-22T13:51:00.000Z	tarzeau_		i can't run to each workstation to set it up manually (besides that doesn't work either)
2010-01-22T13:51:00.000Z	ardchoille	tarzeau_	you're comparing a display manager to a desktop environment
2010-01-22T13:51:00.000Z	tarzeau_	ardchoille	no i just want a display manager to fit in our environment
2010-01-22T13:52:00.000Z	ardchoille	tarzeau_	gdm is still undergoing feature implementation
2010-01-22T13:52:00.000Z	tarzeau_	ardchoille	so i should wait for 1009?
2010-01-22T13:52:00.000Z	ardchoille	tarzeau_	10.04 might have more gdm features enabled
2010-01-22T13:52:00.000Z	tarzeau_	ardchoille	i don't want features. i only want to install a theme
2010-01-22T13:53:00.000Z	ardchoille	tarzeau_	That's a feature
2010-01-22T13:53:00.000Z	tarzeau_	ardchoille	it feels like windows
2010-01-22T13:54:00.000Z	ardchoille	tarzeau_	gdm at this time doesn't have many theming features
2010-01-22T13:54:00.000Z	tarzeau_	ardchoille	i see, so i'm stuck with the ugly brown of ubuntu and the black and white background of mine: http://gnu.ethz.ch/zebrawhitebw.jpg
