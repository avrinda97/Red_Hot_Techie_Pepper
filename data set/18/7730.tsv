2007-11-23T10:24:00.000Z	Cpudan80		Ok everyone
2007-11-23T10:24:00.000Z	Cpudan80		I switched my gfx card driver to the propriety ATi driver, but now it won't display right
2007-11-23T10:25:00.000Z	Cpudan80		I switched it back to the previous setting, but I cant get it to stick...
2007-11-23T10:25:00.000Z	Cpudan80		It stays at Generic Vesa
2007-11-23T10:26:00.000Z	Cpudan80		If anyone has any ideas... they are much appreciated !
2007-11-23T10:27:00.000Z	Shahar	Cpudan80	worst case, edit /etc/X11/xorg.conf, find the line that says "Driver "vesa"" and change it to rage128 or whatever
2007-11-23T10:28:00.000Z	Cpudan80	Shahar	I have a backup of the file
2007-11-23T10:28:00.000Z	Cpudan80		I might restore it
2007-11-23T10:28:00.000Z	Shahar		that might be best
2007-11-23T10:28:00.000Z	Shahar		but read that help page
2007-11-23T10:29:00.000Z	Cpudan80	Shahar	It's a laptop --- I dont think the drivers support my model
2007-11-23T10:29:00.000Z	Shahar		ATI's drivers have always been flaky
2007-11-23T10:29:00.000Z	Cpudan80		The good news is it's fixed anyway
2007-11-23T10:29:00.000Z	Shahar	Cpudan80	the rumor is that they support all cards
2007-11-23T10:29:00.000Z	Shahar		nvidia now has 2 sets I think
2007-11-23T10:29:00.000Z	Cpudan80		Note to self: Do not ever mess around in the screens/gfx window
2007-11-23T10:29:00.000Z	Shahar		one for old cards and one for new cards
2007-11-23T10:29:00.000Z	Cpudan80	Shahar	Well... ehh I'd rather not mess with anymore lol
