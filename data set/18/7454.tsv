2008-01-06T16:10:00.000Z	hunchybunch	Sontax	change it in your /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2008-01-06T16:10:00.000Z	hunchybunch	Sontax	sudo nano  /etc/X11/xorg.conf - change nvidia to nv?
2008-01-06T16:13:00.000Z	hunchybunch	Sontax	can you run it from your menu?
2008-01-06T16:17:00.000Z	hunchybunch	Sontax	it should have made copies of previous xorg.conf's in the X11 directory for you
2008-01-06T16:18:00.000Z	hunchybunch	Sontax	maybe change back by copying one of em to xorg.conf>
2008-01-06T16:19:00.000Z	Sontax	hunchybunch	can u help me on pm ?
2008-01-06T16:19:00.000Z	hunchybunch	Sontax	I dunno, maybe you could also go into a safe-mode and get to restricted-manager?
2008-01-06T16:20:00.000Z	hunchybunch	Sontax	yes, those are previous ones - you could copy by cp xorg.conf.2 xorg.conf?
2008-01-06T16:22:00.000Z	hunchybunch	Sontax	but if you did this by installing the nvidia driver by some other means other than the ubuntu way, it may not do you any good.
2008-01-06T16:24:00.000Z	hunchybunch	Sontax	and there isn't an option for that?  if not, you may want to edit your /etc/X11/xorg.conf and change it.
2008-01-06T16:25:00.000Z	hunchybunch	Sontax	but maybe your video card cannot change to that resolution - i dont know anything about nvidia
2008-01-06T16:34:00.000Z	hunchybunch	Sontax	i use xrandr to push it to my tv
2008-01-06T16:35:00.000Z	hunchybunch	Sontax	but i have an old ati card - mileage may differ
