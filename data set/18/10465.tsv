2007-10-19T10:17:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	Pie-rate	Install splashy
2007-10-19T10:17:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	Pie-rate	http://splashy.alioth.debian.org/wiki/ubuntu
2007-10-19T10:18:00.000Z	Pie-rate	Jordan_U_	why doesn't usplash ever work?
2007-10-19T10:18:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	Pie-rate	Works for me, I just don't like that it is half impossible to create a new theme for it
2007-10-19T10:19:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	Pie-rate	with splashy it couldn't be easier, in fact splashy > usplash in every way I can think of :)
2007-10-19T10:19:00.000Z	Pie-rate	Jordan_U_	on one computer the monitor says "out of range," on my laptop it just gives a black screen
2007-10-19T10:20:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	Pie-rate	That sounds like a frame buffer problem rather than a usplash problem, but try splashy anyway
2007-10-19T10:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	Pie-rate	X does not use the frame buffer :)
2007-10-19T10:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	Pie-rate	Do your tty's work?
2007-10-19T10:21:00.000Z	Pie-rate	Jordan_U_	yes.
2007-10-19T10:24:00.000Z	Pie-rate	Jordan_U_	damnit, the splash screen is the first thing a new user sees when they install ubuntu. it really pisses me off that they can't get it right. it's broken for me one way or another on at least 3 separate computers
2007-10-19T10:24:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	Pie-rate	Does splashy work for you?
2007-10-19T10:25:00.000Z	Pie-rate	Jordan_U_	haven't tried it
2007-10-19T10:25:00.000Z	Pie-rate	Jordan_U_	if splashy is better, why isn't it used?
2007-10-19T10:25:00.000Z	Jordan_U_	Pie-rate	I have no idea, been wondering that myself
2007-10-19T10:59:00.000Z	Pie-rate	Jordan_U_	actually, my ttys don't work reliably any more.
2007-10-19T11:02:00.000Z	Pie-rate	Jordan_U_	hate hate hate hate hate hate hate ATI.
