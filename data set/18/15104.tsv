2005-05-06T08:25:00.000Z	KarlosII		huh?
2005-05-06T08:27:00.000Z	KarlosII		when I visit the site the webstart speedtest doesn't work, I'm not sure how webstart relates to java
2005-05-06T08:28:00.000Z	KarlosII		I have no idea what I need to do to get it working......
2005-05-06T08:28:00.000Z	Delph	KarlosII	throw it at javaws
2005-05-06T08:28:00.000Z	KarlosII		javaws
2005-05-06T08:28:00.000Z	KarlosII		yes
2005-05-06T08:29:00.000Z	Delph		Do you have java web start installed?
2005-05-06T08:29:00.000Z	Delph		if not, then you're unlikely to be able to run java webstart applications.
2005-05-06T08:29:00.000Z	KarlosII	Delph	that is a good question is the packaged name javaws like you mentioned b4?
2005-05-06T08:29:00.000Z	Delph		packaged?
2005-05-06T08:29:00.000Z	KarlosII		package
2005-05-06T08:29:00.000Z	Delph		I've no idea how ubuntu is doing it.
2005-05-06T08:29:00.000Z	KarlosII		hmm
2005-05-06T08:30:00.000Z	Delph		I'd reccomend ditching any ubuntu packages and installing it from sun.
2005-05-06T08:30:00.000Z	KarlosII		I figured java webstart would install with the packages, I've tried both from ubuntu sources and from sun
2005-05-06T08:30:00.000Z	Delph	KarlosII	go back to the sun site, last I checked it was a seperate download for linux.
2005-05-06T08:31:00.000Z	KarlosII		ah
2005-05-06T09:02:00.000Z	Delph	KarlosII	found it?
