2008-10-27T02:31:00.000Z	Naisenu		Err okay I know I need to use the Troubleshooting partition of this wiki page (https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows#Troubleshooting) ... but I also know my drive is not hda0 ... how do i remember what the drive is labelled?
2008-10-27T02:33:00.000Z	Naisenu		There isn't some easy GUI to just repair my grub is there?
2008-10-27T02:33:00.000Z	Raylz	Naisenu	sudo update-grub
2008-10-27T02:34:00.000Z	Naisenu	Raylz	Will that work if I'm currently running off the Live CD?
2008-10-27T02:34:00.000Z	Raylz	Naisenu	if you chroot into your partitions and mount proc and dev, yes
2008-10-27T02:35:00.000Z	Raylz	Naisenu	its quite easy
2008-10-27T02:35:00.000Z	Naisenu	Raylz	You completely lost me on the chroot part stuffs
2008-10-27T02:36:00.000Z	Raylz	Naisenu	you need to mount your partitions in your pc
2008-10-27T02:36:00.000Z	Raylz		then you chroot into it (sudo chroot /path/to/disk
2008-10-27T02:36:00.000Z	Naisenu	Raylz	Both the / and the swap?
2008-10-27T02:37:00.000Z	Raylz	Naisenu	are you currently in your livecd?
2008-10-27T02:37:00.000Z	Naisenu	Raylz	Yes.
2008-10-27T02:37:00.000Z	Naisenu		my root is /dev/sda1 & swap is /dev/sda2
2008-10-27T02:38:00.000Z	Raylz	Naisenu	lets do this via query
2008-10-27T02:39:00.000Z	Naisenu	Raylz	Sure. No idea what the ID is for the Windows partition, unless it's that /sda3
2008-10-27T02:59:00.000Z	Naisenu	Raylz	It worked ... except how do I make it so I don't need to press Esc to see all the options?
2008-10-27T02:59:00.000Z	Raylz		it would be so nice if you could choose your environment at the installation
