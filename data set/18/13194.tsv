2007-05-09T11:47:00.000Z	sony	soundray	thanks~anyway~
2007-05-09T11:47:00.000Z	soundray	sony	anyway what?
2007-05-09T11:48:00.000Z	soundray	sony	still listening?
2007-05-09T12:17:00.000Z	sony	soundray	ya,I'm here.
2007-05-09T12:18:00.000Z	sony	soundray	I'm reading help pages of rsync.
2007-05-09T12:19:00.000Z	soundray	sony	'rsync --dry-run --verbose --progress --stats --compress --rsh=/usr/bin/ssh --recursive --times --perms --links --delete --exclude "*bak" --exclude "*~" * user@remotehost:/target/directory' is what I always use to synchronize directories between machines.
2007-05-09T12:19:00.000Z	soundray	sony	remove the --dry-run once you trust it
2007-05-09T12:20:00.000Z	sony	soundray	greatly thanks you.
2007-05-09T12:22:00.000Z	sony	soundray	one more question----How could I find if someone send message to me in irc instead of looking for it per page of irc channel?
2007-05-09T12:22:00.000Z	soundray	sony	depends on your client. Mine alerts me via the task list when it's in the background.
2007-05-09T12:23:00.000Z	sony	soundray	I'm using irssi command under freebsd.
2007-05-09T12:24:00.000Z	soundray	sony	in that case I'll be useless, sorry
2007-05-09T12:24:00.000Z	sony	soundray	That's ok.Tnanks for your help.
2007-05-09T12:44:00.000Z	sony	soundray	Then in the case that I want to synchronize files and folders between folders and folders in the local host?
2007-05-09T12:45:00.000Z	soundray	sony	leave out the --rsh option and replace the user@remotehost part with just the target directory.
2007-05-09T12:46:00.000Z	sony	soundray	Greatly thanks for your help and advice.I'm reading manual pages of it.
