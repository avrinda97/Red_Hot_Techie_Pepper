2007-12-01T06:20:00.000Z	danbhfive	Hanyou	have you tried the dig command?
2007-12-01T06:21:00.000Z	Hanyou	danbhfive	Didn't know there was one. I'm pretty new to Linux as a whole since the late 90's.
2007-12-01T06:24:00.000Z	Hanyou	danbhfive	It stops at the other end of my T1 line on my firewall at 192.168.1.254. I don't think it's just my firewall though, because it can't hit any of my server farm on that range either.
2007-12-01T06:24:00.000Z	Hanyou	danbhfive	the last valid thing it hits is my Cisco Gateway on this range at 192.168.0.1
2007-12-01T06:27:00.000Z	Hanyou	danbhfive	Maybe I can restart it into submission like I did with my laptop lol.
2007-12-01T06:28:00.000Z	Hanyou	danbhfive	I'm a MCP and what works, works lol.
2007-12-01T06:30:00.000Z	Hanyou	danbhfive	Do you think it could be b/c I have two network cards that it is confusing the Linux config?
2007-12-01T06:33:00.000Z	Hanyou	danbhfive	I tried restarting the networking to no effect.
2007-12-01T06:38:00.000Z	Hanyou	danbhfive	Went through that with the laptop. All that was left when I was done was me to terminal into my Cisco Gateway and rewrite my routing table.
2007-12-01T06:40:00.000Z	Hanyou	danbhfive	I'm pretty swift when it comes to anything PC or Apple related, but this has me tied upside down on a freeway overpass.
2007-12-01T06:45:00.000Z	Hanyou	danbhfive	Well, regardless I got it to work on one machine today even if it was just luck.
2007-12-01T06:46:00.000Z	Hanyou	danbhfive	Don't worry I didn't come in expecting a solution, just a push in the right direction.
2007-12-01T06:46:00.000Z	Hanyou	danbhfive	As I said, samn thing with the computer I am typing on right now earlier today. Then, poof, magic it works. Wierd......
2007-12-01T06:47:00.000Z	Hanyou	danbhfive	Just wish there was someone in here that knew exactly what my problem was.
2007-12-01T06:59:00.000Z	Hanyou	danbhfive	Are you refering to AirSnort or a derivative there of?
2007-12-01T06:59:00.000Z	danbhfive	Hanyou	well, hehe, I don't know,  I'm a total noob at this, but im using wireshark,     It just seemed like a next step for you
2007-12-01T07:00:00.000Z	Hanyou	danbhfive	I will try that, though I doubt it will help me much.
2007-12-01T07:15:00.000Z	Hanyou	danbhfive	Do you know how to disable a piece of hardware on gutsy? I have been looking in support docs and haven't found crap.
