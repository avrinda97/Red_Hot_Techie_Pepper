2009-10-04T15:43:00.000Z	grawity	Enriquei	mpd itself runs as a daemon, and to control it you use a 'client' - there are many for GNOME, KDE, terminal-based, web-based, and so on.
2009-10-04T15:44:00.000Z	grawity	Enriquei	For a nice GNOME client, install Sonata.
2009-10-04T15:44:00.000Z	Enriquei		will check out sonata
2009-10-04T15:44:00.000Z	Enriquei		is it self-sufficient or is it a front end?
2009-10-04T15:45:00.000Z	grawity	Enriquei	gmpc and ario are two more GNOME clients for mpd.
2009-10-04T15:46:00.000Z	Enriquei		thanks
2009-10-04T15:48:00.000Z	Enriquei		got a link for sonata?
2009-10-04T15:48:00.000Z	Enriquei	grawity	^^
2009-10-04T15:48:00.000Z	grawity	Enriquei	All of them are in Ubuntu package manager.
2009-10-04T15:48:00.000Z	grawity		!info sonata
2009-10-04T15:49:00.000Z	Enriquei		thank you
2009-10-04T15:50:00.000Z	grawity	Enriquei	In other words, 'sudo apt-get install mpd sonata gmpc ario ncmpc' in Terminal.
