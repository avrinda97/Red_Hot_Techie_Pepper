2007-11-15T10:42:00.000Z	tomd	xivanari	yeah but it can probably still be mounted. do a google for <drive name> mount linux and see what it turns up?
2007-11-15T10:46:00.000Z	tomd	xivanari	you can probably mount your external hard drive with linux, this would be an easier option
2007-11-15T10:46:00.000Z	xivanari	tomd	i dont know what mounting a drive is.
2007-11-15T10:47:00.000Z	tomd	xivanari	mounting a drive is equivalent to going into my computer on windows and clicking D: or C: kind of.. except you put all the drive contents in a tree under a directory..
2007-11-15T10:48:00.000Z	tomd	xivanari	what kind of external hard drive do you have
2007-11-15T10:51:00.000Z	tomd	xivanari	ah, proprietary compression
2007-11-15T10:52:00.000Z	tomd	xivanari	do you have access to another computer?
2007-11-15T10:52:00.000Z	xivanari	tomd	i do not
