2008-02-19T16:49:00.000Z	Yancho	Agent_bob	* Stopping GNOME Display Manager... [ ok ] - but i still have the login screen not a black cli
2008-02-19T16:50:00.000Z	Agent_bob	Yancho	?
2008-02-19T16:50:00.000Z	Yancho	Agent_bob	on my screen there is the login screen not a black command line terminal
2008-02-19T16:51:00.000Z	Agent_bob	Yancho	are you saying that gdm is still running after you try to kill it.  or that there is a ghost picture left over on the display ?
2008-02-19T16:51:00.000Z	Agent_bob	Yancho	can you login there or not ?
2008-02-19T16:52:00.000Z	Agent_bob	Yancho	and you ran     sudo /etc/init.d/?dm stop    ???
2008-02-19T16:52:00.000Z	Agent_bob	Yancho	if that doesn't kill gdm then there is a bug
2008-02-19T16:54:00.000Z	Agent_bob	Yancho	before i leave that with you let me ask one more thing    id did close for a moment then restart when you ran that command ?
2008-02-19T16:54:00.000Z	Yancho	Agent_bob	my main concern is that the screensaver doesnt come in .. if i log out will it keep working etc?
2008-02-19T16:54:00.000Z	Yancho	Agent_bob	nope nothign
2008-02-19T16:55:00.000Z	Agent_bob	Yancho	then don't file that bug report yet.
2008-02-19T16:55:00.000Z	Agent_bob	Yancho	or maybe you typo'd ?
2008-02-19T16:58:00.000Z	Agent_bob	Yancho	heh.  it happens
