2011-03-16T03:32:00.000Z	Counterspell		Can Ubuntu 10.10 32-bit support 6GB of RAM?
2011-03-16T03:32:00.000Z	ohzie	Counterspell	no
2011-03-16T03:32:00.000Z	ohzie	Counterspell	I mean it'll run, it won't break
2011-03-16T03:32:00.000Z	ohzie	Counterspell	but it won't use all your ram
2011-03-16T03:32:00.000Z	Counterspell	ohzie	that's what i thought, why is 64-bit "recommended"?
2011-03-16T03:32:00.000Z	ohzie	Counterspell	so you can use all your ram
2011-03-16T03:32:00.000Z	ohzie	Counterspell	Duh. :-P
2011-03-16T03:33:00.000Z	Counterspell	ohzie	no i mean 32-bit lol sorry
2011-03-16T03:33:00.000Z	Counterspell		i see
2011-03-16T03:33:00.000Z	ohzie	Counterspell	Oh because 64 bit introduces some complications.
2011-03-16T03:33:00.000Z	Counterspell		thanks for the info
2011-03-16T03:33:00.000Z	Counterspell		i am currently running 10.04 64-bit
2011-03-16T03:33:00.000Z	ohzie	Counterspell	not all apps have working 64 bit builds.
2011-03-16T03:33:00.000Z	Counterspell		but i am having trouble with Wacom drivers
2011-03-16T03:33:00.000Z	ohzie	Counterspell	don't switch to 32 unless you have problems
2011-03-16T03:33:00.000Z	ohzie	Counterspell	and even then, there are ways to run the 32 bit apps in a chroot
2011-03-16T03:33:00.000Z	ohzie	Counterspell	with 32 bit libraries
2011-03-16T03:34:00.000Z	ohzie	Counterspell	and if you're willing to put up with that, it's so much better for your system to run 64 bit.
