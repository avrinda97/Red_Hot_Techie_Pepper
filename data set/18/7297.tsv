2010-05-04T01:18:00.000Z	edmund		Hi, I'm trying to share my internet connection via ethernet but I am having some problems. Router A is connected to the internet directly, my ubuntu computer connects to router A with wifi, my ubuntu computer alos has an ethernet cable going to router B, there's a ethernet cable going from router B to my debian computer. I have just set up firestarter to allow internet sharing. From the debian computer I can now ping both m
2010-05-04T01:18:00.000Z	edmund		y ubuntu computer and router A, but can't seem to use the internet from the debian computer. I assume the ubuntu computer must be succesfull in sharing what its receiving from the wireless adapter with the debian computer, as I can ping router A, but I dont understand why I cant use the internet on it. Any help would be appreciated.

2010-06-06T23:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	edmund	you mount partitions, not disks
2010-06-06T23:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	edmund	is the drive which holds the partition a usb or an internal device?
2010-06-06T23:50:00.000Z	edmund	ActionParsnip	it's a SATA hard drive plugged in via USB with an adaptor
2010-06-06T23:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	edmund	has it been in a windows pc?
2010-06-06T23:52:00.000Z	edmund	ActionParsnip	yes, it came from my laptop, which is now broken, on which I ran winVista and ubuntu, ubuntu is on the ext4 partition which works fine, and vista on the ntfs partition, which is the partition thats not working
2010-06-06T23:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	edmund	when you removed it from the pc did you safetly remove it or just rip it out?
2010-06-06T23:59:00.000Z	edmund	ActionParsnip	so I expect the partitions to be corrupted, because of the way I had to remove it, but I'm hoping there's a way to fix them
2010-06-07T00:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	edmund	in a windows system use the disk checker and remember to use the safe remove feature in both windows and linux
2010-06-07T00:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	edmund	they exist for a reason :)
2010-06-07T00:03:00.000Z	edmund	ActionParsnip	As said above, I didn't even have the chance to safely remove the drive, as it just disconnencted due to a hardware fault in my laptop. Also, I'm wondering if there's a way to fix the partitions in linux, as I dont have a windows computer to hand
2010-06-07T00:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	edmund	if you plug it in widows do you get access to the data?
2010-06-07T00:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	edmund	it may be useful as NTFS is proprietary to Microsot
2010-06-07T00:05:00.000Z	edmund	ActionParsnip	i dont have a windows computer, but may be able to use one within the next few days...
2010-06-07T00:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	edmund	you may be able to get the data if you use foremost. If you restore from backup you can simply reformat the device then restore the data easily
2010-06-07T00:08:00.000Z	edmund	ActionParsnip	thankyou for your help- I'm going to find a windows computer to use...
