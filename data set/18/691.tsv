2011-10-23T05:37:00.000Z	klync	unityayaya	any guess as to why? was there a disk error? probably best to reboot from cd and fsck
2011-10-23T05:40:00.000Z	klync	unityayaya	`shutdown -Fr now` <- force fsck and reboot
2011-10-23T05:45:00.000Z	klync	unityayaya	how about this: `grep -A 2 -B 2 remounting /var/log/kern.log`

2011-10-23T05:53:00.000Z	klync	unityayaya	i dont' understand exactly what you did with the 2nd drive, but this sounds like what's causing the problem. how about you unplug it and reboot with the system as it was?

2011-10-23T05:59:00.000Z	unityayaya	klync	 you can not  understand me   ok  easly   i  have 2 hdd on my pc  1st hdd installed on   win + ubuntu 10.10     and   second  hdd installed  11.10     and when i login  on  11.10 and formated 10.10 by  gpart  on 11.10  that problem hapend
2011-10-23T06:01:00.000Z	klync	unityayaya	i see. ... so you should be able to unplug the 1st drive with win + 10.10 and boot from the 2nd drive, assuming grub is installed ok, ya?
