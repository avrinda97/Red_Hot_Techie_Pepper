2008-10-14T17:41:00.000Z	jvargas	ziroday`	and take a look at images, they look wide.
2008-10-14T17:41:00.000Z	ziroday`		jvargas:does this only happen in firefox?
2008-10-14T17:43:00.000Z	jvargas	ziroday`	not sure, the rest of icons on ubuntu look ok, can't say too bad.
2008-10-14T17:44:00.000Z	ziroday`	jvargas	hmm, because this looks very much like a firefox rendering issue, the icons above look fine
2008-10-14T17:45:00.000Z	jvargas	ziroday`	but, if I try other lower resolutions, for all of them things look fatter.
2008-10-14T17:45:00.000Z	jvargas	ziroday`	so, 1440x900 is the only one that looks a bit better.
2008-10-14T17:45:00.000Z	ziroday`	jvargas	however the distortion only happens in firefox
2008-10-14T17:47:00.000Z	jvargas	ziroday`	just noted something... my monitor spec says it works at 1440x900 using 60Hz, and ubuntu says it is using 51Hz
2008-10-14T17:47:00.000Z	ziroday`	jvargas	can you change it to 60Hz?
2008-10-14T17:47:00.000Z	jvargas	ziroday`	how do I change that permanently'
2008-10-14T17:48:00.000Z	jvargas	ziroday`	not from config dialog, 60Hz option is not displayed.
2008-10-14T17:48:00.000Z	jvargas		and i am afraid ubuntu replaces my xorg config when I restart
2008-10-14T17:48:00.000Z	ziroday`	jvargas	hmm, then it is most likely on the correct option already if that option is not available. I need to go now sorry
2008-10-14T17:49:00.000Z	ziroday`	jvargas	and for what its worth, I think its a firefox rendering issue
2008-10-14T17:49:00.000Z	jvargas	ziroday`	ok thank u so much
2008-10-14T17:49:00.000Z	ziroday`	jvargas	sorry, I couldn't help you more.
