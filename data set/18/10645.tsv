2007-06-03T09:20:00.000Z	IntangibleLiquid		hi, is there anyway to install Ubuntu from a Windows laptop without DVD -Drive?
2007-06-03T09:21:00.000Z	IntangibleLiquid		<linuxgeekery>: is there anyway to install from an iso image?
2007-06-03T09:21:00.000Z	IntangibleLiquid		<Jordan_U>: I have a thumbdrive
2007-06-03T09:22:00.000Z	IntangibleLiquid		I'm burning the ISO image to the thumbdrive and asking how to do it
2007-06-03T09:22:00.000Z	IntangibleLiquid		<Jordan_U>: is it safe?
2007-06-03T09:24:00.000Z	IntangibleLiquid		does wubi mean that I can install Ubuntu along with Windows without having to repartition the harddrive?
2007-06-03T09:24:00.000Z	Jordan_U	IntangibleLiquid	Yes
2007-06-03T09:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	IntangibleLiquid	there are many ways, do you have a thumb drive? ( I assume no DVD means no CD also ?)
2007-06-03T09:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	IntangibleLiquid	Yes, but it isn't officially supported
2007-06-03T09:22:00.000Z	Jordan_U	IntangibleLiquid	Yes
2007-06-03T09:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U	IntangibleLiquid	Note though that wubi is not officially supported and may not work as well
2007-06-03T09:28:00.000Z	Jordan_U	IntangibleLiquid	What do you mean? It doesn't use the standard install iso but it doesn't require burning a CD
2007-06-03T09:29:00.000Z	Jordan_U	IntangibleLiquid	I don't think so
2008-04-28T04:51:00.000Z	Jordan_U	IntangibleLiquid	It really depends on the webcam, some work out of the box, others just require firmware to work, the rest are generally PITA
2008-04-28T04:51:00.000Z	IntangibleLiquid	Jordan_U	thanks. I'm reading the website ubotu gave me
2010-12-18T12:55:00.000Z	Jordan_U	IntangibleLiquid	Have you been using sudo with GUI apps instead of gksudo?
2010-12-18T12:55:00.000Z	IntangibleLiquid	Jordan_U	not that often sir
2010-12-18T12:56:00.000Z	Jordan_U	IntangibleLiquid	What is the output of "ls -l .ICEauthority"?
