2005-04-19T10:48:00.000Z	EvilIdler		Well, UT2004 works and has sound after replacing libSDL and openal.so with proper 64-bit versions.
2005-04-19T10:49:00.000Z	EvilIdler		I burn in stereo. A DVD burner in each computer :)
2005-04-19T10:50:00.000Z	ells	EvilIdler	what ya use to compress video for dvds
2005-04-19T10:51:00.000Z	EvilIdler	ells	I don't - it's only for backing up stuff, really. But I guess transcode would do the job, and I think there is one DVD authoring frontend which uses it
2005-04-19T10:52:00.000Z	ells	EvilIdler	I have been thru it all, it wont work for me, but i was told that dvd shrink is about it to do complete backups
2005-04-19T10:53:00.000Z	EvilIdler	ells	The WinXP box has CloneDVD2, which does an excellent job should I ever need it. dvd::rip for even more compression on Linux, though.
2005-04-19T10:54:00.000Z	EvilIdler	ells	Yep. And that's what some people need for some purposes.
2005-04-19T10:54:00.000Z	EvilIdler	ells	I could use a proper DVD authoring tool in Linux, though. A friend of mine is making movies and needs a hand in editing.
2005-04-19T10:55:00.000Z	EvilIdler	ells	I can rule out Wine here.
2005-04-19T10:55:00.000Z	ells	EvilIdler	why?
2005-04-19T10:56:00.000Z	EvilIdler	ells	AMD64. The short version is "No".
2005-04-19T10:56:00.000Z	EvilIdler	ells	32-bit games work, but Wine is worse. I can absolutely not compile it without cross-compiling to ia32, and the binaries I've tried are flakier than usual.
2005-04-19T10:57:00.000Z	EvilIdler	ells	I get by with a gaming computer on my left hand :)
2005-04-19T10:59:00.000Z	EvilIdler	ells	XP is an entertainment-only system for me, and this AMD64 runs only Linux. There's also a PS2 hooked up to the TV card. Only need a Mac Mini, then I have all the options I need :)
2005-04-19T10:59:00.000Z	ells	EvilIdler	sounds like you got it all
2005-04-19T11:00:00.000Z	EvilIdler	ells	I was well-paid in my last job. All spent on hardware now :P
2005-04-19T11:01:00.000Z	EvilIdler	ells	I've only got one awful upgrade job to do now..this AMD64 needs the replacement fan I just bought. That means taking out the whole motherboard, which is what I hate most.
2005-04-19T11:02:00.000Z	ells	EvilIdler	I know the deal, I built this desktop
