2009-10-17T11:34:00.000Z	RobotCow		how do i get rid of the ubuntu theme for firefox so it doesnt block personas addon (new for firefox 3.5)
2009-10-17T11:34:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	RobotCow	Did you try applying a different Firefox theme?
2009-10-17T11:35:00.000Z	RobotCow	leaf-sheep	yes and those blocked as well. i just want the default.
2009-10-17T11:35:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	RobotCow	I don't know what personas addon but I'm checking it out.
2009-10-17T11:37:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	RobotCow	The addons worked for me.  Nice themes.
2009-10-17T11:37:00.000Z	RobotCow	leaf-sheep	yes they are. however i cant get rid of that stinking default theme for ubuntu in firefox. what theme are you using?
2009-10-17T11:38:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	RobotCow	Personally, I use ChromiFox Basic -- but to get it working with the said plugin, I have to use Default (Tango).
2009-10-17T11:38:00.000Z	RobotCow	leaf-sheep	they are different than themes. they are personas, new in ff 3.5, worked fine in windoze
2009-10-17T11:39:00.000Z	RobotCow	leaf-sheep	im going to try removing firefox-gnome-branding
2009-10-17T11:40:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	RobotCow	It's a default theme. It won't hurt to leave it alone.
2009-10-17T11:41:00.000Z	RobotCow	leaf-sheep	it blocks the top from seeing the personas and now i can only see the personas at the bottom of FF
2009-10-17T11:42:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	RobotCow	I'm thinking you have multiple addons that may be the root of the problem, not the Default theme.
2009-10-17T11:42:00.000Z	RobotCow	leaf-sheep	im pretty sure i have all the same exact addons in windoze, ugh, ill figure it out
2009-10-17T11:42:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	RobotCow	How many addons?
2009-10-17T11:44:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	RobotCow	I have 11 or 12. Try disabling all themes and see what happen!  If that works, then you know it's not the theme.  Start enabling two or three addons at a one time.  As to narrow down to the particular addon.
2009-10-17T11:44:00.000Z	RobotCow	leaf-sheep	9, but one is that ubuntu one i cant remove
2009-10-17T12:22:00.000Z	RobotCow	leaf-sheep	what version of ff are you using?
2009-10-17T12:22:00.000Z	leaf-sheep	RobotCow	Gecko/20091007 Ubuntu/9.10 (karmic) Firefox/3.5.3
