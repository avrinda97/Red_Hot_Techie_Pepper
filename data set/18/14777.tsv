2005-09-05T11:15:00.000Z	Madpilot	konra`	check the wiki, I'm pretty sure there's a Doom 3 howto there - wiki.ubuntu.com
2005-09-05T11:20:00.000Z	konra`	Madpilot	thank you
2005-09-05T11:21:00.000Z	Madpilot	konra`	no problem
2005-09-05T11:24:00.000Z	konra`	Madpilot	I am got as far as the doom3 wiki page gets, but I'm having trouble actually starting it
2005-09-05T11:25:00.000Z	Madpilot	konra`	I haven't run it myself, I just remembered seeing it on the wiki... try "doom3" on a command line?
2005-09-05T11:25:00.000Z	konra`	Madpilot	I know the command and all
2005-09-05T11:25:00.000Z	konra`	Madpilot	it just fails to start
2005-09-05T11:26:00.000Z	konra`	Madpilot	the screen goes blank, and then I have no way to quit or anything, and have to force a shutdown using the power button
2005-09-05T13:19:00.000Z	Madpilot	konra`	"killall esd" on a prompt before you start the game often works
2005-09-05T13:19:00.000Z	konra`	Madpilot	thank you (again)
2005-09-05T13:22:00.000Z	Madpilot	konra`	not for esd. (use "esd" to restart it, btw)
2005-09-05T13:51:00.000Z	konra`	Madpilot	I love you (thank you so much for the help)
2005-09-07T10:26:00.000Z	Madpilot	konra`	yes, but I don't know details
2005-09-07T10:27:00.000Z	konra`	Madpilot	any suggestions?
2005-09-07T10:28:00.000Z	Madpilot	konra`	I think SAMBA will allow you to do it
2005-09-07T12:36:00.000Z	Madpilot	konra`	https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SettingUpSamba - seems to have at least most of the info you need
