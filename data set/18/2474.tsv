2010-07-29T08:39:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	econdudeawesome	i don't believe that is an option in UNE, in Gnome yes.
2010-07-29T08:40:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	ZykoticK9	spot on. That's wht I was saying
2010-07-29T08:40:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	econdudeawesome	sorry it was just the way you broke your statement up there, i wasn't sure ;)
2010-08-04T08:49:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	econdudeawesome	Patrickdk's command is correct, just be aware that "a-x" is All or Everyone - executable
2010-08-04T08:50:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	ZykoticK9	Patrickdk, it didn't work. Root is the owner--do I need to run as sudo?
2010-08-04T08:51:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	econdudeawesome	yes, if root owns it
2010-08-04T08:51:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	econdudeawesome	is this a file or a directory BTW?
2010-08-04T08:51:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	ZykoticK9	I'm attempting to apply it to files... is this only for directories?
2010-08-04T08:52:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	econdudeawesome	just be aware that if it's a directory that executable mean you can enter the directory (kinda important)
2010-08-04T08:52:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	econdudeawesome	it's for both
2010-08-04T08:53:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	econdudeawesome	"for file in *; do chmod a-x $file; done" might work - if you want EVERYTHING
2010-08-04T08:54:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	ZykoticK9	thanks
2010-08-04T08:54:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	ZykoticK9	for the tab shortcut
2010-08-04T08:54:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	ZykoticK9	what is $file exactly?
2010-08-04T08:55:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	econdudeawesome	that is a variable that will be replaced by each filename/directory in the present directory
2010-08-04T08:55:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	ZykoticK9	never mind, makes sense :-)
2010-08-18T20:44:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	ZykoticK9	why can't you? Seems like you should be able to. If nothing else, can install it to a separate partition...
2010-08-18T20:44:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	econdudeawesome	of course you could dual boot desktop/server
