2007-12-12T03:07:00.000Z	wols	IngerPoznas	then ask HIM how to run it not us. use ubuntu's screen
2007-12-12T03:08:00.000Z	wols	IngerPoznas	cause you miss a library. what is this "screen" supposed to do?

2007-12-12T03:10:00.000Z	wols	IngerPoznas	what scanner do you have?
2007-12-12T03:10:00.000Z	wols	IngerPoznas	that's not the name/brand of your scanner is it?
2007-12-12T03:11:00.000Z	wols	IngerPoznas	it's quite doable to boot from flash disks if the BIOS supports it
2007-12-12T03:11:00.000Z	wols	IngerPoznas	LAST time I ask: what scanner is this?

2007-12-12T03:17:00.000Z	wols	IngerPoznas	I don#t think this is the right name since there is no scanner of that name in google
2007-12-12T03:18:00.000Z	wols	IngerPoznas	scanner as in glassplate you lay a parep on and it digitalizes a pciture for your computer, right?
