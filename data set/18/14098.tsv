2008-07-31T11:43:00.000Z	ph8		or you could just run the envy install command
2008-07-31T11:43:00.000Z	ph8		things like this can be frowned upon 'because they dont' teach users how things work' - but with things like nvidia driver install (which I use envy-ng for) it's a lifesaver
2008-07-31T11:45:00.000Z	ph8		heh
2008-07-31T11:45:00.000Z	ph8		then install nvidia drivers
2008-07-31T11:46:00.000Z	ph8		and i think it gives you a default xorg.conf
2008-07-31T11:46:00.000Z	ph8		otherwise if you can login run nvidia-settings and set up your screens
2008-07-31T11:46:00.000Z	ph8		it's envy-ng if you're on hardy btw
2008-07-31T11:46:00.000Z	ph8		should be obvious from milone's website
2008-07-31T11:47:00.000Z	ph8		cool
2008-07-31T11:47:00.000Z	ph8		BTW envy installs the proprietary nvidia binary drivers, which is why it's not shipped by default - there are some open nvidia drivers that come with ubuntu but they're not as good(tm)
2008-07-31T11:48:00.000Z	Flannel	ph8	there is an official way of installing said binary drivers too.  Restricted Drivers Manager
2008-07-31T11:48:00.000Z	ph8		yeh but good luck with that :p
2008-07-31T11:49:00.000Z	ph8		nvidia-settings is the best screen/xorg setup has ever been - i'm so happy with it
2008-07-31T11:49:00.000Z	Flannel	ph8	It works perfectly fine
2008-07-31T11:49:00.000Z	ph8	Flannel	 WIth the open drivers?
2008-07-31T11:49:00.000Z	ph8		why does envy exist otherwise?
2008-07-31T11:49:00.000Z	ph8		i've never been able to install any other way
2008-07-31T11:49:00.000Z	Flannel	ph8	No.  It installs closed drivers.
