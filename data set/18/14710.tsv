2005-06-24T09:35:00.000Z	cdc		hi people  i have been using Debian Sarge for the past one year and i am really impressed with it but today i got 10 sets of Ubuntu X86 CDS i am just thinking of installing it
2005-06-24T09:35:00.000Z	cdc		i just want to know whether Ubuntu would be better than Debian Sarge
2005-06-24T09:35:00.000Z	cdc		infact i have been a KDE user but for the past few days i ve switched to Gnome . is Ubuntu better than Debian Sarge?
2005-06-24T09:36:00.000Z	mindspin	cdc	its a question of taste and purpose...
2005-06-24T09:36:00.000Z	cdc	mindspin	i like Debian and Ubuntu is based on Debian and i am a developer i use my system for Development so in that case what do you say?
2005-06-24T09:37:00.000Z	cdc	mindspin	so what do you say . I ve got Ubuntu 5.0.4 CDS so tell me what would it be like ? :-)
2005-06-24T09:38:00.000Z	cdc	mindspin	i am running Gnome 2.8 but Ubuntu has got 2.10 and thats a major advantage
2005-06-24T09:38:00.000Z	cdc	mindspin	tried it it was good
2005-06-24T09:40:00.000Z	mindspin	cdc	try #kubuntu
2005-06-24T09:41:00.000Z	cdc	mindspin	how about the number of repositories for apt-get
2005-06-24T09:55:00.000Z	mindspin	cdc	it is
2005-06-24T09:57:00.000Z	cdc	mindspin	but if i install it will it be fast enough like Sarge?
2005-06-24T10:01:00.000Z	mindspin	cdc	you got some space on your harddisk?
2005-06-24T10:01:00.000Z	cdc	mindspin	no extra space either i ve to remove Sarge and then try Ubuntu
2005-06-24T10:02:00.000Z	cdc	mindspin	does Ubuntu have alsa support in it ?
2005-06-24T10:02:00.000Z	cdc	mindspin	but i am just worried about one thing the speed Sarge runs is good will Ubuntu run at the same speed ?
2005-06-24T10:03:00.000Z	cdc	mindspin	but i dont have that much space
2005-06-24T10:03:00.000Z	mindspin	cdc	will you kill me if its slower?
