2006-08-20T14:32:00.000Z	mirzapirza		i think i just killed a laptop.. put in the ubuntu cd, went for 'verify disk', eventually it was giving me looping IRQ 15 errors, so i shut it down -- and now nothing :X i turn it on, the fan goes turns on and a few seconds later it just quiets down :/
2006-08-20T14:32:00.000Z	sethk	mirzapirza	sounds like a thermal shutdown, possibly.  wait a bit and try again
2006-08-20T14:33:00.000Z	sethk	mirzapirza	verify doesn't write anything
2006-08-20T14:33:00.000Z	mirzapirza	sethk	well, it was a while ago actually
2006-08-20T14:33:00.000Z	sethk	mirzapirza	possibly the disk was about to die and you pushed it over the edge
2006-08-20T14:33:00.000Z	mirzapirza		maybe :/
2006-08-20T14:33:00.000Z	mirzapirza		it's old
2006-08-20T14:33:00.000Z	sethk	mirzapirza	put it in the fridge for a while  :)
2006-08-20T14:34:00.000Z	mirzapirza		but i get no error messages or anything when i start it.. it just shuts down, and it's been at least an hour now
2006-08-20T14:34:00.000Z	sethk	mirzapirza	that's very odd.  you should at least get the startup bios messages
2006-08-20T14:34:00.000Z	sethk	mirzapirza	remove the hard drive, see if the messages come back
2006-08-20T14:34:00.000Z	mirzapirza		any guesses on what it was doing when it said 'disabling irq 15'?
2006-08-20T14:35:00.000Z	sethk	mirzapirza	just that.  there is no way that can carry over across a hard boot
2006-08-20T14:35:00.000Z	mirzapirza	sethk	i'm not equipped to dig into it and remove the hard drive :o
2006-08-20T14:35:00.000Z	mirzapirza		dang :x
2006-08-20T14:35:00.000Z	sethk	mirzapirza	I think it's fair to say that the message about the irq indicates either a serious incompatibility or a serious hardware problem
2006-08-20T14:36:00.000Z	mirzapirza	sethk	the eth is a pc card, but it wasn't plugged in.. anything about that?
2006-08-20T14:37:00.000Z	sethk	mirzapirza	I doubt it's relevant
