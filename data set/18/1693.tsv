2010-12-22T06:00:00.000Z	pops_	KM0201	it's not working.  I might have to give up
2010-12-22T06:01:00.000Z	KM0201		lol
2010-12-22T06:01:00.000Z	KM0201	pops_	did you follow the instructions for the STA driver?
2010-12-22T06:01:00.000Z	pops_	KM0201	 yes.  It made my Broadcom STA driver "active but not in use"
2010-12-22T06:02:00.000Z	KM0201	pops_	did you restart?
2010-12-22T06:02:00.000Z	pops_		of course
2010-12-22T06:02:00.000Z	KM0201		is the kernel soruce installed?
2010-12-22T06:02:00.000Z	pops_	KM0201	well i followed the instructions that seemed to correspond to that.  and i followed them again and it said "your kernel is up to date" already or somesuch
2010-12-22T06:03:00.000Z	KM0201	pops_	are you on the live cd, or did you install?
2010-12-22T06:03:00.000Z	pops_	KM0201	i installed. the hardware driver changed its mind now it's "active and in use"
2010-12-22T06:04:00.000Z	KM0201	pops_	ok...
2010-12-22T06:04:00.000Z	pops_	KM0201	 mayb that second restart did something? or maybe i misread it the first time
2010-12-22T06:04:00.000Z	KM0201	pops_	who knows...give it a few minutes to scan for networks, and see if it starts working
2010-12-22T06:05:00.000Z	pops_	KM0201	:/ oh well
2010-12-22T06:08:00.000Z	KM0201	pops_	are you using 32 or 64bit?
2010-12-22T06:09:00.000Z	pops_	KM0201	i've checked which my laptop was before but i always forget
2010-12-22T06:09:00.000Z	pops_	KM0201	 guess i'll google the model
2010-12-22T06:09:00.000Z	KM0201	pops_	in a terminal type "uname -a" no quotes, and hit enter
