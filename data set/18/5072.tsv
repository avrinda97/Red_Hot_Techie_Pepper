2010-05-07T02:52:00.000Z	casual		could anyone please help me to get network manager applet to work? I have both network-manager and wicd installed at the moment.
2010-05-07T02:52:00.000Z	craigbass1976	casual	are your network cards able to work at all?  What's ifconfig -a tell you?
2010-05-07T02:53:00.000Z	casual	craigbass1976	 they work just fine on a 10.04 live cd
2010-05-07T02:54:00.000Z	craigbass1976	casual	hang on a minute; let me get apache started automatically first.
2010-05-07T02:58:00.000Z	craigbass1976	casual	I'm rebooting, brb
2010-05-07T03:02:00.000Z	craigbass1976	casual	ok, what does ifconfig -a tell you?
2010-05-07T03:03:00.000Z	casual	craigbass1976	the only thing I seem to be connected to is eth0
2010-05-07T03:05:00.000Z	craigbass1976	casual	go to a pastbin (pastebin.net is one, but there's an ubuntu one too I guess) and paste the output of ifconfig -a
2010-05-07T03:06:00.000Z	casual	craigbass1976	I cant do that since I'm not connected on that machine. i did ifconfig -a and the only thing that is connected is eth0, though the wirless interface does show up. :)
2010-05-07T03:07:00.000Z	craigbass1976	casual	and what does the network manager say, or is it not even popping up?
2010-05-07T03:07:00.000Z	casual	craigbass1976	it isn't even showing up
2010-05-07T03:08:00.000Z	craigbass1976	casual	what happens when you click on it, nothing?
2010-05-07T03:08:00.000Z	casual	craigbass1976	I said its not there :)
2010-05-07T03:09:00.000Z	craigbass1976	casual	you mean it's not even in the menu?
2010-05-07T03:10:00.000Z	casual	craigbass1976	its not in the notification area. i don't know what you mean when you ask "you mean it's not even in the menu"
2010-05-07T03:11:00.000Z	craigbass1976	casual	what version of ubuntu are you on?  In this stock lucid install, it's in System --> Preferences --> Network Connections
2010-05-07T03:13:00.000Z	casual	craigbass1976	10.04 and the network i want to connect to doesnt show up in network connections
2010-05-07T03:14:00.000Z	craigbass1976	casual	are you trying to connect to a wireless network?  brb, rebooting again
