2006-03-22T14:20:00.000Z	batman		hello can someone tell me why my sound settings go back to default after i close the alsa mixer when i set it myself?
2006-03-22T14:22:00.000Z	batman		does anyone know of a way to set the sound card default settings and keep them that way?
2006-03-22T14:22:00.000Z	h36sa	batman	alsactl store
2006-03-22T14:22:00.000Z	batman	h36sa	in the terminal?
2006-03-22T14:23:00.000Z	batman	h36sa	is that after i set it with the gui alsa mixer?
2006-03-22T14:23:00.000Z	h36sa	batman	yeah
2006-03-22T14:28:00.000Z	batman	h36sa	that still didn't save my custom settings for me :S
2006-03-22T14:29:00.000Z	h36sa	batman	that's how you do it in gentoo at least.. maybe do alsamixer then alsactl store afterwards
2006-03-22T14:30:00.000Z	h36sa	batman	you also need to set your box up to run alsactl restore when you want them set..
2006-03-22T14:37:00.000Z	batman	h36sa	do you have to do the alsactl restore every time you open up a music player ex: xmms, mplayer?
2006-03-22T14:38:00.000Z	h36sa	batman	no, just after you boot
2006-03-22T14:38:00.000Z	batman	h36sa	well i have to every time i do >.<
2006-03-22T14:40:00.000Z	h36sa	batman	copy a windows install over and it'll work
2006-03-22T14:40:00.000Z	batman	h36sa	i tried
2006-03-22T14:40:00.000Z	h36sa	batman	I've had q3 running on freebsd and gentoo before.. I'm sure it works with ubuntu
2006-03-22T14:41:00.000Z	batman	h36sa	so just copy over my install from windows?
2006-03-22T14:41:00.000Z	h36sa	batman	yeah... then find a howto and make sure you've got the dir/files with the proper caps
2006-03-22T14:41:00.000Z	batman	h36sa	i'll do it again and tell you the error message i get...
