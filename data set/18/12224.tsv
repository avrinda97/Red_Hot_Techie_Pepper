2009-05-17T20:04:00.000Z	wowisit112		ne1 can help
2009-05-17T20:06:00.000Z	wowisit112		no one has any idea on how to install ubuntu on an external HD???
2009-05-17T20:06:00.000Z	ikonia	wowisit112	yes, just install it to the external disk
2009-05-17T20:06:00.000Z	ikonia	wowisit112	make sure grub is also put on the external disk IF you plan to move the disk around
2009-05-17T20:09:00.000Z	ikonia	wowisit112	your external hardisk is not present in the installer even if you select "custom" as the partition type ?
2009-05-17T20:11:00.000Z	ikonia	wowisit112	how is your external disk connected ?
2009-05-17T20:12:00.000Z	ikonia	wowisit112	how is it connected though
2009-05-17T20:12:00.000Z	ikonia	wowisit112	so if you boot into your windows partition, do you see the disk ?
2009-05-17T20:13:00.000Z	ikonia	wowisit112	no - if you boot into windows do you see the disk with all the files on it ?
2009-05-17T20:15:00.000Z	ikonia	wowisit112	thats ok, just trying to determain the state of things
2009-05-17T20:15:00.000Z	ikonia	wowisit112	so you can see half the disk that has windows files on from your vista boot ?
2009-05-17T20:17:00.000Z	ikonia	wowisit112	oh, even better, you are botting from it
2009-05-17T20:17:00.000Z	ikonia	wowisit112	Booting sorry
2009-05-17T20:18:00.000Z	ikonia	wowisit112	ok, so boot the ubuntu live/install cd and lets see if this is fixable
2009-05-17T20:19:00.000Z	ikonia	wowisit112	well, when ever you are ready
2009-05-17T20:20:00.000Z	ikonia	wowisit112	you can open irc on the ubuntu livecd
2009-05-17T20:21:00.000Z	ikonia	wowisit112	boot from the livecd, open xchat or an irc client and lets see if this will work
