2009-04-22T18:36:00.000Z	JPZ`		Hello everyone. I've  been struggling with an application that uses java. It has my CPU at 100% most of the time. I've read countless forum posts regarding this topic. Does anyone know of a java stress test that could confirm whether or not my java instalation is defective?
2009-04-22T18:38:00.000Z	pumpkin_	JPZ`	do you run openjava or the sun edition?
2009-04-22T18:38:00.000Z	JPZ`	pumpkin_	sun-java-6
2009-04-22T18:38:00.000Z	JPZ`		with ubuntu 8.10
2009-04-22T18:38:00.000Z	pumpkin_	JPZ`	that JVM is fine and should work.
2009-04-22T18:39:00.000Z	pumpkin_		is pidgin totally broken in interpid? it seg-faults instandly ...
2009-04-22T18:40:00.000Z	JPZ`	pumpkin_	is there a chance that I might have misconfigued something or could it just be the application that is at fault ?
2009-04-22T18:41:00.000Z	pumpkin_	JPZ`	it should be the application, unless you did something very strange. You never deleted stuff from /usr/lib/jvm ?
2009-04-22T18:41:00.000Z	JPZ`	pumpkin_	all I did was install java, perhaps install other java packages by mistake, but that is all.
2009-04-22T18:42:00.000Z	pumpkin_	JPZ`	is this a java applet or the standalone java program ?
2009-04-22T18:43:00.000Z	JPZ`	pumpkin_	its a java application (http://www.objectplanet.com/probe/)
2009-04-22T18:43:00.000Z	JPZ`		java standalone*
2009-04-22T18:44:00.000Z	pumpkin_	JPZ`	that thing is evil, it probes the network via JNI. Yes, that can cause 100% load.
2009-04-22T18:46:00.000Z	JPZ`	pumpkin_	haha, nice definition. I tried to keep in mind that it itself would use alot of recources depending on traffic, but since we also use Untangle ( web filter that runs on java) and barely uses 50% cpu, I was skeptic.  Ubuntu stops responding after a few days if I leave that app running non stop.
2009-04-22T18:47:00.000Z	pumpkin_	JPZ`	you can try to increase the jvm-ram: java -Xms1000M -Xmx1000M .... But i don't think it will work form more then one week.
2009-04-22T18:49:00.000Z	JPZ`	pumpkin_	ok, I'll see if that works. Thanks alot for your time. Do you by any chance know of another application other than that netprobe that might do a better job and not consume as much recources by any chance ?
2009-04-22T18:49:00.000Z	pumpkin_	JPZ`	i don't need to know what is going over our network, so no.
2009-04-22T18:50:00.000Z	JPZ`	pumpkin_	ok, thanks for the help though.
