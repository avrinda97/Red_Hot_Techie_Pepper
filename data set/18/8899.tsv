2007-06-08T13:12:00.000Z	fdoving	KI4IKL	can you paste the complete error to a pastebin?
2007-06-08T13:12:00.000Z	fdoving		!pastebin > ki4ikl
2007-06-08T13:12:00.000Z	KI4IKL		I typed ./configure, everythign else was okay, that was the only error part
2007-06-08T13:12:00.000Z	fdoving	KI4IKL	it checks for error flags. it's not an error unless it fails.
2007-06-08T13:13:00.000Z	KI4IKL		Found it.
2007-06-08T13:16:00.000Z	KI4IKL		Is there any alternative to synergy?
2007-06-08T13:17:00.000Z	KI4IKL		posted, fdoving ...paste.ubuntu-nl.org/24675
2007-06-08T13:18:00.000Z	fdoving	KI4IKL	that's a command, not an error.
2007-06-08T13:18:00.000Z	KI4IKL		oh...but it does that over and over and over
2007-06-08T13:18:00.000Z	KI4IKL		make
2007-06-08T13:18:00.000Z	KI4IKL		argh, wrong keyboard
2007-06-08T13:18:00.000Z	KI4IKL	fdoving	it does that over and over and over and over.
2007-06-08T13:19:00.000Z	fdoving	KI4IKL	yep, it's copiling. it's correct, when it stops it's finished.
