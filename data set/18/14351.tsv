2006-04-06T09:39:00.000Z	Toma-	xstation	make sure you add "mknod /dev/kqemu c 250 0" and "chmod 666 /dev/kqemu" to a startup script orelse it wont work after rebooting
2006-04-06T09:41:00.000Z	Toma-	xstation	you need more than that
2006-04-06T09:42:00.000Z	Toma-	xstation	a startup script in /etc/init.d...
2006-04-06T09:43:00.000Z	Toma-	xstation	ive made a custom script called "alsa-games" that runs all my startup commands
2006-04-06T09:47:00.000Z	Toma-	xstation	ok, copy and paste this "sudo touch /etc/init.d/customstuff && sudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/customstuff && sudo echo 'mknod /dev/kqemu c 250 0' >> /etc/init.d/customstuff && sudo echo 'chmod 666 /dev/kqemu' >> /etc/init.d/customstuff && sudo update-rc.d customstuff defaults"
2006-04-06T09:50:00.000Z	Toma-	xstation	customstuff will now be run at startup and shutdown. you can put anything you want in there
2006-04-06T09:51:00.000Z	Toma-	xstation	no need
2006-04-06T09:53:00.000Z	Toma-	xstation	yep. what i told you to paste will make a file for you in /etc/init.d/ called customstuff and make it executable, add the commands you need to run and set it up to boot
2006-04-06T09:55:00.000Z	Toma-	xstation	what?
2006-04-06T09:56:00.000Z	Toma-	xstation	just run the commmand and itll get kqemu to work on each boot
2006-04-06T09:57:00.000Z	Toma-	xstation	yeh, just add them onto their own line
2006-04-06T09:57:00.000Z	Toma-	xstation	just ask someone else, i gotta go sorry :(
