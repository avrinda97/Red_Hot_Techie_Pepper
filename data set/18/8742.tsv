2008-05-14T23:48:00.000Z	Flannel	Marfi	install the build-essential package
2008-05-14T23:48:00.000Z	Marfi	Flannel	duh, i knew that! ty
2008-11-20T22:47:00.000Z	Marfi	Flannel	or just when it boots to run that check?
2008-11-20T22:32:00.000Z	Marfi	Flannel	lol, i know. i was asking him if thats what he did
2008-11-20T22:32:00.000Z	Flannel	Marfi	Yes.  And thats why you shouldn't say it.
2008-11-20T22:45:00.000Z	Flannel	Marfi	There is no password.  If enter doesn't work, your disk could be a bad burn (or its not an official Ubuntu one, some of the third party spinoffs have passwords)
2008-11-20T22:46:00.000Z	Marfi	Flannel	disks should be fine. got the .iso's from canonical via torrent when they first came out. i've also used them for recovery, and this hasn't been a problem
2008-11-20T22:46:00.000Z	Flannel	Marfi	Have you checked them for defects?
2008-11-20T22:46:00.000Z	Marfi	Flannel	checksum <pathtoiso>.iso?
2008-11-20T22:47:00.000Z	Flannel	Marfi	yes
2008-11-20T22:48:00.000Z	Flannel	Marfi	that is, from the boot thing.
2008-11-20T22:48:00.000Z	Marfi	Flannel	running now. will give an update shortly
2008-11-20T22:51:00.000Z	Marfi	Flannel	did the scan and it said there was an error in 1 file. i've used the image before...any ideas?
2008-11-20T22:53:00.000Z	Flannel	Marfi	Try burning another CD at a low speed, 4x or whatnot.  A better burn should fix that problem ( as far as usage prior, I have no idea.  The file with the error obviously only affects the stuff using that file, apparently the liveCD's password stuff)
2008-11-20T22:53:00.000Z	Marfi	Flannel	happened with the ubuntu and xubuntu disk
2009-02-25T08:58:00.000Z	Flannel	Marfi	The flash package means you don't have to use wget.
2009-02-25T08:58:00.000Z	Marfi	Flannel	I know, but it will kick back an md5 error from tiem to time
