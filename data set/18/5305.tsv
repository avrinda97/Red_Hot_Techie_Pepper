2008-11-15T22:18:00.000Z	vladuz976		no one here has this nvidia driver problem after upgrading?
2008-11-15T22:18:00.000Z	vladuz976		I've seen tons of posts on the forum, but no solution yet. anybody?
2008-11-15T22:19:00.000Z	mooded	vladuz976	the last one i talked to finally reinstalled 8.04.. since none of the nvidia-drivers worked in 8.10 for him / her / whatever
2008-11-15T22:19:00.000Z	vladuz976	mooded	so for some people it works, for others it doesn't?
2008-11-15T22:20:00.000Z	vladuz976	mooded	what does it depend on?
2008-11-15T22:20:00.000Z	mooded	vladuz976	i guess solving it depends on your knowledge about kernel-compiling asf...
2008-11-15T22:20:00.000Z	mooded	vladuz976	i have 9800gtx nvidia and it works.. (but i installed 8.10 directly, no update or so)
2008-11-15T22:20:00.000Z	vladuz976	mooded	i am thinking of doing that too
2008-11-15T22:21:00.000Z	mooded	vladuz976	yup.. but its a stoneage-old prob and really really not trivial to solve..
2008-11-15T22:22:00.000Z	vladuz976	mooded	I'd install from CD, but no blank cds, lol
2008-11-15T22:22:00.000Z	mooded	vladuz976	damn ;))
2008-11-15T22:22:00.000Z	vladuz976	mooded	usb boot doesn't work for me somehow
2008-11-15T22:22:00.000Z	vladuz976	mooded	guess I gotta wait til tomorrow and buy some cds
2008-11-15T22:22:00.000Z	mooded	vladuz976	thats prolly the least problematic way ;)
2008-11-15T22:26:00.000Z	vladuz976	mooded	do you have anymore links regarding this topic, maybe you know of some i haven't read yet
2008-11-15T22:26:00.000Z	mooded	vladuz976	nope.. dont have any links.. only some years of linux experience ,) so i only point out common tarpits mostly ,)
2008-11-15T22:27:00.000Z	vladuz976	mooded	so just out of curiousity, with every release you do a fresh install?
2008-11-15T22:28:00.000Z	mooded	vladuz976	nope.. i compile my kernels on my own if i need it.. and update the rest respectively.. (only 8.10 was a fresh install, since its my first ubuntu.. used debian for ages before)
