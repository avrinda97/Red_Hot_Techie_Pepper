2010-12-22T23:22:00.000Z	kwtm	bonjoyee	Hey, is there a program _pg_ can set up at home to listen to Port 22 (replacing sshd) which can just output whatever it hears, to see if computers on the WAN are getting through?
2010-12-22T23:23:00.000Z	bonjoyee	kwtm	_pg_ can vnc into his home..so tell him to check /var/log/auth!
2010-12-22T23:25:00.000Z	kwtm	bonjoyee	If ports higher than 1024 are the issue, can _pg_ tell sshd to listen on port 2222 and try to get in?  (For all we know, it might be Comcast blocking ports <1024)
2011-01-14T16:00:00.000Z	bonjoyee	kwtm	download the libflashplayer.so from adobe and paste in /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins
2011-01-14T16:02:00.000Z	kwtm	bonjoyee	Oh, I see, so you think that would be better than doing automated from Ubuntu?  I think getting it manually is what I did before, but that was half a year ago, so I'm not sure if that's the last thing I did.
2011-01-14T16:02:00.000Z	bonjoyee	kwtm	this method has never let me down!
2011-01-14T16:03:00.000Z	bonjoyee	kwtm	but make sure you remove other versions from synaptic!
2011-01-14T16:04:00.000Z	kwtm	bonjoyee	Ah, maybe last time I didn't remove other versions?
2011-01-14T16:04:00.000Z	bonjoyee	kwtm	could be,,
2011-01-14T16:05:00.000Z	bonjoyee	kwtm	im using flash 64bit (square preview3 currently)
2011-01-14T16:25:00.000Z	kwtm	bonjoyee	Thank you! It worked!
2011-01-14T16:25:00.000Z	kwtm	bonjoyee	Well, I didn't do *exactly* what you said ... but you inspired me to go manually remove all versions of Flash... but it was still in Firefox.
2011-01-14T16:27:00.000Z	bonjoyee	kwtm	q_a_z_steve: :)
2011-01-14T16:27:00.000Z	kwtm	bonjoyee	It turns out that after removal, there's *still* this flash plugin in my mozilla directory, clinging on like an unwiped piece of ... er, never mind.  Aaaanyway...
2011-01-14T16:28:00.000Z	kwtm	bonjoyee	I removed that, and now the usual "sudo apt-get install adobe-flashplugin" has put Flash 10 on my system!  Now I get the best of both worlds: you were right, but also this plugin will be autoupdated with apt-get. :)
2011-01-14T16:28:00.000Z	bonjoyee	kwtm	thats nice!! best of both world truly!:)
2011-01-14T16:39:00.000Z	bonjoyee	kwtm	now i wish i had a paypal account...would have benefited from those virtual credit cards of yours;)
