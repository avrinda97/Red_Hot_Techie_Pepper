2008-01-11T01:04:00.000Z	wizzo_		can anyone help me figure out why i've found two websites that wont load on my computer anymore?
2008-01-11T01:04:00.000Z	elisboa	wizzo_	virtual servers?
2008-01-11T01:05:00.000Z	wizzo_	elisboa	what do you mean?
2008-01-11T01:05:00.000Z	elisboa	wizzo_	your two websites are configured as virtual servers on apache/
2008-01-11T01:06:00.000Z	wizzo_	elisboa	no no, websites that i'm trying to goto, two i've found so far one is netscape.com  it comes up saying server not found
2008-01-11T01:06:00.000Z	elisboa	wizzo_	maybe you have a dns problem?
2008-01-11T01:07:00.000Z	wizzo_	elisboa	the thing is i know the site is working, when i goto terminal and do host netscape.com i get the ip's but when i ping it i get 100% packet loss
2008-01-11T01:07:00.000Z	wizzo_	elisboa	. truna: also pepboys.com  :P
2008-01-11T01:07:00.000Z	elisboa	wizzo_	pings don't say much; the site administrator may have them blocked up
2008-01-11T01:08:00.000Z	wizzo_	elisboa	oh, do you have any suggestions to figure out what the problem is?
2008-01-11T01:08:00.000Z	elisboa	wizzo_	so; maybe you have proxy set up on your browser?
2008-01-11T01:09:00.000Z	elisboa	wizzo_	from a terminal, try to do: telnet site 80
2008-01-11T01:09:00.000Z	wizzo_	elisboa	says its unable to connect to host
2008-01-11T01:10:00.000Z	wizzo_	elisboa	no route to host
2008-01-11T01:11:00.000Z	wizzo_	elisboa	maybe i did the command wrong? nc pepboys.com 80 ?
2008-01-11T01:16:00.000Z	elisboa	wizzo_	there is a way to use nc, but I don't know how
2008-01-11T01:18:00.000Z	wizzo_	elisboa	i just read something online saying that in order to use netcat the other computer needs to be setup to receive them...
2008-01-11T01:19:00.000Z	wizzo_	elisboa	want to just get me thing direct link for netscape so i can wget it? lol
