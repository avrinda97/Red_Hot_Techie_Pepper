2005-11-24T08:57:00.000Z	BooZee		help with flash problems!
2005-11-24T08:58:00.000Z	topyli	BooZee	that's not a question. would you like to ask one?
2005-11-24T08:58:00.000Z	BooZee	topyli	i sure do. I can't see text in flash movies. not regular text (which I CAN see, but texts inside textbox)
2005-11-24T08:58:00.000Z	BooZee	topyli	did I explain myself good?
2005-11-24T08:59:00.000Z	topyli	BooZee	the explanation is fine :) can you point me to an example flash on the web?
2005-11-24T08:59:00.000Z	BooZee		google analytics
2005-11-24T09:00:00.000Z	BooZee	topyli	google analytics - but you gotta have an account in it to see it
2005-11-24T09:00:00.000Z	BooZee	topyli	which I guess that you don't have
2005-11-24T09:00:00.000Z	topyli	BooZee	i do have a google account
2005-11-24T09:00:00.000Z	BooZee	topyli	I mean an account in google analytics
2005-11-24T09:00:00.000Z	BooZee	topyli	which is an urchin statistics account
2005-11-24T09:00:00.000Z	topyli	BooZee	ah, i just have a general google password
2005-11-24T09:01:00.000Z	BooZee	topyli	well than, I guess you couldn't see it. do you know flash designing?
2005-11-24T09:01:00.000Z	topyli	BooZee	not at all. i hate flash :)
2005-11-24T09:02:00.000Z	topyli	BooZee	just wondering, because i've never had such a problem with flash...
2005-11-24T09:03:00.000Z	BooZee	topyli	well, flash has ordinary text which you can design, move, color for it's output. and it has an option for textbox where you can get text from an application
2005-11-24T09:03:00.000Z	BooZee	topyli	which is used for scripting
2005-11-24T09:03:00.000Z	BooZee	topyli	and that text, I cant see on the web
