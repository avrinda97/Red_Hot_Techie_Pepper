2007-03-13T13:45:00.000Z	panfist		hey, what are some good music players on ubuntu? is there one similar to foobar?
2007-03-13T13:45:00.000Z	xtknight	panfist	i like audacious
2007-03-13T14:59:00.000Z	xtknight	panfist	change what kind of setting?
2007-03-13T15:00:00.000Z	panfist	xtknight	vm settings like add or remove hardware, or even open the vm settings menu
2007-03-13T15:00:00.000Z	xtknight	panfist	have you tried defragmenting the vm
2007-03-13T15:00:00.000Z	panfist	xtknight	its a fresh machine pre-allocated on a totally blank partition
2007-03-13T15:00:00.000Z	xtknight	panfist	also i find XFS better for huge files and VMs.  i cant boot my vista mv off ext3 without serious lag every time.  but xfs works reasonably well for instance.  and xfs has a defrag tool xfs_fsr
2007-03-13T15:01:00.000Z	xtknight	panfist	im afraid i have no idea then
2007-03-13T15:01:00.000Z	xtknight	panfist	what is making it slow?  i/o?  cpu cycles?
2007-03-13T15:01:00.000Z	panfist	xtknight	how would i figure that out? im very new at this
2007-03-13T15:02:00.000Z	xtknight	panfist	using the gnome system monitor, gnome-system-monitor from terminal.  i have to go now unfortunately, may be able to help you.  but that can help track down wheree the lag is coming from
2007-03-13T15:02:00.000Z	panfist	xtknight	thanks
2007-03-13T15:02:00.000Z	xtknight	panfist	may be able to help you, later i mean.
2007-07-22T12:17:00.000Z	xtknight	panfist	do you end up at a "busybox"?
2007-07-22T12:18:00.000Z	panfist	xtknight	from the alternate or regular cds? from the alternate i end up at "ubuntu installer main menu" with the 3rd step "detect and mount cdrom" highlighted
2007-07-22T12:19:00.000Z	panfist	xtknight	i dont recall busybox from the other install media but i really dont remember
2007-07-22T12:19:00.000Z	xtknight	panfist	hmm.  does it say "tty job control" or anything weird like that?
2007-07-22T12:19:00.000Z	panfist	xtknight	yes it does, i can pop in the live cd right now to get the exact error message but that rings a bell
