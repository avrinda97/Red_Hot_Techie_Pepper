2008-05-01T06:33:00.000Z	kneeki		Well, that's a bummer. after doing the Ubuntu updates to go from 8.04 beta to release, I've lost all my screen resolutions other than 640x480 and 320x240
2008-05-01T06:33:00.000Z	kneeki		Any ideas how I get 1440x900 back? :)
2008-05-01T06:33:00.000Z	bazhang	kneeki	sudo displayconfig-gtk does not work?
2008-05-01T06:34:00.000Z	kneeki	bazhang	one moment, I'll find out
2008-05-01T06:35:00.000Z	kneeki	bazhang	it brings up the config window, but 1440x900 is not in the list. Just the two very classic resolutions
2008-05-03T21:24:00.000Z	bazhang	kneeki	likely not necessary; what is the issue
2008-05-03T21:25:00.000Z	kneeki	bazhang	I cannot use apt-get nor Synaptic package manager from System -> Admin (it's not listed), and neither is Software Sources
2008-05-03T21:25:00.000Z	bazhang	kneeki	close them all and open a terminal
2008-05-03T21:25:00.000Z	kneeki	bazhang	I have a terminal up now
2008-05-03T21:26:00.000Z	bazhang	kneeki	what does sudo apt-get update return -->pastebin errors if any
2008-05-03T21:26:00.000Z	kneeki	bazhang	Absolutly nothing, one sec for copy/paste
2008-05-03T21:27:00.000Z	bazhang	kneeki	can you pastebin your sources.list please
2008-05-03T21:27:00.000Z	kneeki	bazhang	Sure, one moment
2008-05-03T21:29:00.000Z	kneeki	bazhang	http://pastebin.com/m47056f9
2008-05-03T21:30:00.000Z	bazhang	kneeki	you have almost no sources
2008-05-03T21:30:00.000Z	kneeki	bazhang	oh?
2008-05-03T21:53:00.000Z	kneeki	bazhang	Got the problem solved by the way. It appears that my acct was no longer in the admin group. After doing a recovery mode 'adduser kneeki admin' and rebooting, I'm golden. Everything is the way it should be.
2008-05-03T21:54:00.000Z	bazhang	kneeki	nicely done ;]
