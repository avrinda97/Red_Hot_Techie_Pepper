2005-08-06T05:52:00.000Z	ma3x_		how can i test the graphic 3D after booting from the live cd?
2005-08-06T05:53:00.000Z	ma3x_		ok cafuego. question no2.: where do i find packages for ubuntu?
2005-08-06T05:53:00.000Z	ma3x_		on debian.org?
2005-08-06T05:53:00.000Z	ma3x_		yes, but what's the web where you can browse for packages?
2005-08-06T05:54:00.000Z	ma3x_		ok, so ubuntu is not listed on most of the software pages
2005-08-06T05:54:00.000Z	ma3x_		when i want to download a package, what format should it be, rpm or deb?
2005-08-06T05:55:00.000Z	ma3x_		ok thanks!
2005-08-06T05:57:00.000Z	ma3x_		but most of the sites offer binaries for debian, suse, mandriva, freebsd, slackware ...
2005-08-06T05:57:00.000Z	ma3x_		so if i don't see ubuntu, which of those packages do i download?
2005-08-06T05:58:00.000Z	CarlFK	ma3x_	- I think the right way is to dl the source, then make your own .deb for Ubuntu and install that.
2005-08-06T05:58:00.000Z	CarlFK	ma3x_	- and then post your work somwhere so others don't have to ;)
2005-08-06T05:59:00.000Z	ma3x_	cafuego	plain example, most wanted p2p package http://www.amule.org/dl/index.php
2005-08-06T05:59:00.000Z	ma3x_		what would you download from there?
2005-08-06T06:00:00.000Z	ma3x_	cafuego	it was only example
2005-08-06T06:00:00.000Z	ma3x_		now what most important for me is to connect the laptop to my TV
2005-08-06T06:00:00.000Z	ma3x_		is this possible, and if yes with what software?
2005-08-06T06:00:00.000Z	CarlFK	ma3x_	"aMule sources for the 2.0.3 release."
