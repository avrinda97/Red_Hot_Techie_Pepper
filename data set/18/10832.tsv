2006-11-25T13:48:00.000Z	fnf		Hello, has anyone compiled a custom kernel in Edgy ? I have a few problems that couldn't be resolved yet.
2006-11-25T13:49:00.000Z	fnf		anyone, please ?
2006-11-25T13:50:00.000Z	dabaR	fnf	he has not been in the channel recently, but if you ask your question, the rest of us will try to help
2006-11-25T13:51:00.000Z	fnf	dabaR	(sigh) thank you
2006-11-25T13:52:00.000Z	dabaR	fnf	you compiled a custom kernel, and when you boot it you get a console that has no letters?
2006-11-25T13:53:00.000Z	fnf	dabaR	To ensure maximum compatibility, I have made the new kernel that as bloated as possible, but to no avail. The logs reported vesafb driver has been loaded correctly, but there was no dispaly characters.
2006-11-25T13:54:00.000Z	dabaR	fnf	not sure what to do in that case, sorry
2006-11-25T13:54:00.000Z	fnf	dabaR	startx could bring up the X server, just in case, I suspect there's some obscure console config that caused it.
2006-11-25T13:54:00.000Z	fnf	dabaR	Thanks anyway.
2006-11-25T13:55:00.000Z	dabaR	fnf	welcome:)
2006-11-25T14:46:00.000Z	dabaR	fnf	really?
2006-11-25T14:46:00.000Z	fnf	dabaR	You could have installed GRUB on that driver also. That'll make it independent.
2006-11-25T14:58:00.000Z	dabaR	fnf	use sudo fdisk -l to list hard drive info
2006-11-25T14:58:00.000Z	fnf	dabaR	Ah, sure, 'ls -la /dev/hd*' could also do the trick though.
2006-11-25T14:59:00.000Z	dabaR	fnf	it could, but the command gives useful info
2006-11-25T14:59:00.000Z	fnf	dabaR	Right.
2006-12-06T09:55:00.000Z	dabaR	fnf	don't say that. It would obviously depend on the Internet connection.
2006-12-06T09:56:00.000Z	fnf	dabaR	I see, but installing by apt-get is pretty slow compared to using a download manager.
