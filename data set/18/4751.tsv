2009-02-16T12:40:00.000Z	AkaBkn		hello folks
2009-02-16T12:40:00.000Z	AkaBkn		can someone help me?
2009-02-16T12:40:00.000Z	AkaBkn		my dhclient dosent put the ip from the router in the resolv.conf file... :/
2009-02-16T12:41:00.000Z	Gnea	AkaBkn	what does it put there?
2009-02-16T12:41:00.000Z	AkaBkn	Gnea	the official ips of the nameservers
2009-02-16T12:41:00.000Z	Gnea	AkaBkn	are you sure that your router is running a dns server?
2009-02-16T12:42:00.000Z	AkaBkn	Gnea	yes, it was just perfect, till now... however, i have setup a bridge an so, later i deinstalled it, but it seems that i missed something
2009-02-16T12:44:00.000Z	Gnea	AkaBkn	ah, okay. i would suggest that you go through your router's configuration again with a fine-tooth comb and make sure that everything is setup right... most routers also allow you to backup your configuration parameters to a file. I usually do that in the event that I want to try something off-the-wall, like bridging.
2009-02-16T12:46:00.000Z	AkaBkn	Gnea	i've got the problem with different router (one in school) and i didn't change anything on the router... i think the problem must occures on my machine...
2009-02-16T12:47:00.000Z	Gnea	AkaBkn	if you change your /etc/resolv.conf to use the ip of the router as the dns server, does it work?
2009-02-16T12:48:00.000Z	AkaBkn	Gnea	actually it does :)
2009-02-16T12:49:00.000Z	Gnea	AkaBkn	you should be able to keep it there, and edit /etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf to ensure that it does not overwrite your resolv.conf in the event of a lease renew
2009-02-16T12:50:00.000Z	AkaBkn	Gnea	but i've i change my location i need to reconfig it? so i like to have it like befor
2009-02-16T12:50:00.000Z	Gnea	AkaBkn	you'll need to write your own script for that, then
2009-02-16T12:51:00.000Z	Gnea	AkaBkn	or...
2009-02-16T12:51:00.000Z	Gnea	AkaBkn	iirc, NetworkManager has the ability to use different profiles - you might be able to use a static dns server with it
2009-02-16T12:53:00.000Z	AkaBkn	Gnea	thx
2009-02-16T13:01:00.000Z	AkaBkn	Gnea	how can i see if there are still configured bridges on my machine?
