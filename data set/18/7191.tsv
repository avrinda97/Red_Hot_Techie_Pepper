2008-01-26T09:11:00.000Z	Yoda		Hey all.  I have a Dell Inspiron 1420 with a few media keys on it.  I've successfully and correctly binded them to the keyboard.  In Amarok, I've modified both the shortcuts and global shortcuts to use the media keys, but no luck.  Any help?
2008-01-26T09:11:00.000Z	daniel92	Yoda	go to scripts there is one that has to do with media keys and gnome. it will make them work
2008-01-26T09:12:00.000Z	Yoda	daniel92	Scripts where?
2008-01-26T09:13:00.000Z	daniel92	Yoda	Tools > Script MAnager > Get more scripts
2008-01-26T09:13:00.000Z	daniel92	Yoda	it's called Gnome Multimedia Key's
2008-01-26T09:13:00.000Z	Yoda	daniel92	Oh, in Amarok?  Alright, thanks a lot.
2008-01-26T09:14:00.000Z	daniel92	Yoda	np. it took me a while, but my gateway's media keys work perfect for me now. it should be on by default in gnome...
2008-01-26T09:15:00.000Z	Yoda	daniel92	 Uh oh, it just crashed on me.  I got the KNotify.  Shouldn't be anything bad, but I'm wondering why it crashed after I installed that.
2008-01-26T09:16:00.000Z	daniel92	Yoda	i get that occasionally. i don't think it has to do with the script tho, just that it's a kde app running on gnome
2008-01-26T09:16:00.000Z	daniel92	Yoda	go to #amarok for more support
2008-01-26T09:17:00.000Z	Yoda	daniel92	 Got it, works perfectly now.  Thanks a bunch.
2008-01-26T09:17:00.000Z	daniel92	Yoda	no problem. i love that script. helps with **all** media keys, so nice.
2008-01-26T09:25:00.000Z	daniel92	Yoda	xfe is cool, and really lightweight. not the best looking, but cool. look it up. ot's available in the repositories.
2008-01-26T09:27:00.000Z	daniel92	Yoda	not that i know of. it's pretty hard to replace nautilus. it controls the desktiop and icons too. neither do if you just install them. google could help make it permanent.
2008-01-26T09:28:00.000Z	Yoda	daniel92	 Is there a way I could make it default, at least?
2008-01-26T09:29:00.000Z	daniel92	Yoda	not that i know of. i tried to set pcman fm as default once, but it didn't work. like i said, google could help. someone had to do it at least once.
2008-01-26T09:31:00.000Z	Yoda	daniel92	 Alright, thanks.  Just wanted to check with you first since it's a bit more of an intimate troubleshoot. =P
2008-01-26T09:31:00.000Z	daniel92	Yoda	yeah, I have no idea =P so no bad advice
