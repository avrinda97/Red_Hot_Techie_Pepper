2009-03-18T22:56:00.000Z	hoban		what's the best-practice for disabling a service in a particular run level using upstart? (I want Ubuntu to _not_ launch GDM when I boot up)
2009-03-18T22:58:00.000Z	unop	hoban	 see the manpage of  update-rc.d
2009-03-18T22:58:00.000Z	hoban	unop	I was there. Is that the best practice?
2009-03-18T22:58:00.000Z	hoban	unop	that man page says *not* to use it directly as an admin
2009-03-18T22:59:00.000Z	unop	hoban	 it's a tool for the job - so i suppose so
2009-03-18T22:59:00.000Z	unop	hoban	eh? which line?
2009-03-18T22:59:00.000Z	hoban	unop	search for the line starting: "Please note that this program was designed..."
2009-03-18T23:01:00.000Z	hoban	unop	so it says there to use a tool like sysv-rc-conf or bum, yet both of those packages are not officially supported by canonical
2009-03-18T23:02:00.000Z	unop	hoban	that's not what it's saying - it's saying since there's limited functionality with update-rc.d (I disagree) - people are not encouraged to use it  - but that's subjective advice.
2009-03-18T23:02:00.000Z	hoban	unop	which is why I came here :)
2009-03-18T23:02:00.000Z	hoban	unop	I'm wanting to know what canonical would support and I can't find any documentation on their site covering runlevel management
2009-03-18T23:03:00.000Z	unop	hoban	well, i use it, a lot of other people do too.  and what's wrong with sysv-rc-conf ??  apart from not being 'officially supported'
2009-03-18T23:04:00.000Z	hoban	unop	I am only allowed to use officially supported software on this server
2009-03-18T23:05:00.000Z	hoban	unop	but that seems like the best solution. Thank you for confirming my suspicions
2009-03-18T23:06:00.000Z	unop	hoban	well, by that reckoning - you might as well not use 99% of packages in ubuntu's repositories :)
2009-03-18T23:06:00.000Z	hoban	unop	and sadly, I can't :(
2009-03-18T23:06:00.000Z	hoban	unop	I'm allowed to use the packages provided on the DVD
2009-03-18T23:11:00.000Z	hoban	unop	& maxb: I'm out. Thanks for the help
