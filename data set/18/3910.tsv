2009-07-16T13:44:00.000Z	Slart	richardcavell	good link when you're in doubt =)
2009-07-16T13:44:00.000Z	richardcavell	Slart	I didn't know that one!
2009-07-17T19:05:00.000Z	Slart	richardcavell	less updating
2009-07-17T19:05:00.000Z	Slart	richardcavell	if you have a server you want to use.. and just keep running.. you don't want it to update gnome versions or something like that.. you just want it to run
2009-07-17T19:06:00.000Z	richardcavell	Slart	You mean because the bugs have been ironed out already?  Doesn't that apply to any old stable release? And is there any lack of support for Jaunty?
2009-07-17T19:06:00.000Z	Slart	richardcavell	not really.. but because they stick to one version for a longer time
2009-07-17T19:07:00.000Z	Slart	richardcavell	so you make sure your apps work with what the LTS version offers and then you know that the same app will keep working for the next 5 years.. that makes you sleep better at night =)
2009-07-18T16:20:00.000Z	Slart	richardcavell	you can google for "port 31416", there are several sites that offer port listings with info on daemons and such
2009-07-18T16:20:00.000Z	Slart	richardcavell	http://www.dshield.org/port.html?port=31416  this is one
2009-08-22T13:33:00.000Z	Slart	richardcavell	bah.. nevermind me then
2009-08-22T13:31:00.000Z	richardcavell	Slart	root can do anything
2009-08-22T13:31:00.000Z	Slart	richardcavell	give it a try.. please
2009-08-22T13:31:00.000Z	richardcavell	Slart	I know that, I was replying to Gnea
2009-08-22T13:32:00.000Z	Slart	richardcavell	oh.. it still applies though.. take gnea with you to #ubuntu+1 =)
2009-08-22T13:32:00.000Z	richardcavell	Slart	he's using Jaunty
