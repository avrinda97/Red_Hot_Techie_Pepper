2007-02-06T14:51:00.000Z	iter	tim167	I just use it for quick and dirty fire off an email type mails
2007-02-06T14:51:00.000Z	iter	tim167	if you want a full featured mail client for the console, try mutt
2007-02-06T14:53:00.000Z	tim167	iter	no i want also it for quickly sending some small text mails, its just strange that i didnt specify anything, my address and such...
2007-02-06T14:54:00.000Z	iter	tim167	the "from" address will be the account and account name that you're sending from
2007-02-06T14:54:00.000Z	tim167	iter	typing mailx brings me into some interactive mode ? i have an &-prompt, do i type 'send' now ?

2007-02-06T15:00:00.000Z	tim167	iter	ok tried mailx address@place.com, then typed testmail, ended with dot (.) on one line, it seemed to go ok, but the mail didnt arrive, it didnt ask me 'From' either...
