2005-01-30T15:19:00.000Z	Emanuelez		hello * :)
2005-01-30T15:19:00.000Z	Emanuelez		i'd love to install a groupware software on a linux box in my office. any suggestion?
2005-01-30T15:20:00.000Z	Tomcat_	Emanuelez	Check out eGroupware
2005-01-30T15:20:00.000Z	Tomcat_		OpenGroupware is fine, but the development seems like to be not existing... :o
2005-01-30T15:22:00.000Z	Emanuelez		i checked phpgroupware and egroupware... they look very similar but i liked phpgroupware best so far. i'll check opengroupware now
2005-01-30T15:24:00.000Z	Tomcat_		PHPGroupware is good too, but lacks many features imho.
2005-01-30T15:24:00.000Z	Tomcat_		Not sure how it is today... I checked them about 9 months ago.
2005-01-30T15:25:00.000Z	Emanuelez	Tomcat_	what did it miss?
2005-01-30T15:26:00.000Z	Tomcat_		- project management had fewer features than other groupwares...
2005-01-30T15:26:00.000Z	Tomcat_		- no good document management
2005-01-30T15:26:00.000Z	Tomcat_		- no resource management in projects
2005-01-30T15:27:00.000Z	Tomcat_		- no documentation
2005-01-30T15:27:00.000Z	Tomcat_		- no big community
2005-01-30T15:28:00.000Z	Tomcat_		- many useless features for a professional groupware
2005-01-30T15:29:00.000Z	Emanuelez	Tomcat_	ok... clear enough :) thx
2005-01-30T15:30:00.000Z	Tomcat_		You have to recheck most of this though... as I said my evaluation is a bit old.
2005-01-30T15:30:00.000Z	Tomcat_		The company I work for has gone with OpenGroupware... but now it seems we might change again, because Objective C is not as easy as PHP/JSP/CGI and the OpenGroupware development is not really there.
2005-01-30T15:31:00.000Z	Emanuelez	Tomcat_	of course
