2008-04-25T13:48:00.000Z	MrWGW-		I'd assume its still possible to go root=/dev/sda12 as opposed to using the device ID?
2008-04-25T13:48:00.000Z	MrWGW-		also does the rootfs need to be mounted read only?
2008-04-25T13:49:00.000Z	MrWGW-		and also, will anything break if I don't give it the "quiet" and "splash" params?  I prefer a non-quiet boot to aid in troubleshooting
2008-04-25T13:49:00.000Z	MrWGW-		almost, but not entirely unlike an "iTunes Style Interface" perhaps
2008-04-25T13:50:00.000Z	MrWGW-		maybe, look
2008-04-25T13:52:00.000Z	MrWGW-		actually, GRUB says it can't find the initrd, although I can guarantee you its there
2008-04-25T13:52:00.000Z	MrWGW-		will the system boot without the initrd?
2008-04-25T13:52:00.000Z	MrWGW-		its an ext3 FS
2008-04-25T13:53:00.000Z	MrWGW-		why that pathetic Ubiquity installer couldn't have just done its job I can't imagine, in my experience Ubiquity is one of the most brittle and untrustworthy installers of any Linux distro - I'd be using a different distro except I need LTSP
2008-04-25T13:54:00.000Z	bazhang	MrWGW-	no problems here; you multi-booting?
2008-04-25T13:54:00.000Z	bazhang		capital KDE ;]
2008-04-25T13:55:00.000Z	MrWGW-	bazhang	yes
2008-04-25T13:55:00.000Z	MrWGW-		and Ubuntu tends to puke all over my GRUB config
2008-04-25T13:55:00.000Z	bazhang	MrWGW-	that is the likely source then
2008-04-25T13:55:00.000Z	MrWGW-		for that matter, I'm at a loss as to why GRUB can't find the Ubuntu initrd
2008-04-25T13:55:00.000Z	MrWGW-		well frankly, most distros handle multibooting just fine
2008-04-25T13:56:00.000Z	MrWGW-		*/the path of initrd/*: File not found
2008-04-25T13:56:00.000Z	bazhang	MrWGW-	multi-boot many distros here; ubuntu is one of the best at playing with others imo
