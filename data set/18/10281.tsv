2008-02-09T11:06:00.000Z	leprasmurf		hello all...I'm about to go to bed, what is the most thorough scan of my system that I can run while I sleep?
2008-02-09T11:06:00.000Z	Genius16	leprasmurf	restart at least 40 times and wait for a disc scan
2008-02-09T11:07:00.000Z	leprasmurf	Genius16	I already did an fsck in single user mode
2008-02-09T11:07:00.000Z	Genius16	leprasmurf	lol. yeah i mean if you're running linux you shouldnt need to run any scan for a typical user.
2008-02-09T11:08:00.000Z	Genius16		metal and silicon!
2008-02-09T11:08:00.000Z	leprasmurf	Genius16	understood, but my system is kinda suffering from to many improper shutdowns.  it keeps hanging on shutdown due to a bug in the wireless
2008-02-09T11:09:00.000Z	Genius16	leprasmurf	an automated scan wouldnt fix that.
2008-02-09T11:09:00.000Z	leprasmurf	Genius16	earlier tonight I was experiencing major weirdness with connectivity and such, which prompted me to try some maintenance
2008-02-09T11:09:00.000Z	Genius16	leprasmurf	network weirdness? i love the internets and stuff. what was happeneing? this is wireless i take it?
2008-02-09T11:09:00.000Z	leprasmurf	Genius16	so I don't have to worry about random corruptions, or anything outside of the journal that might not be checked?
2008-02-09T11:10:00.000Z	leprasmurf	Genius16	yeah, wireless.  I used to think it was 'cause of wpa_supplicant, but I disabled wpa on my home wifi and it still happens
2008-02-09T11:10:00.000Z	Genius16	leprasmurf	id say if you're having a problem with the inner-nut-webs its not going to effect your system as a whole.
2008-02-09T11:11:00.000Z	leprasmurf	Genius16	whenever I connect to my home wireless, and subsequently try to shutdown my computer, the shutdown scripts start to run, but hang with some error I have written down somewhere
2008-02-09T11:11:00.000Z	Genius16	leprasmurf	what problem are you having? what are the symptoms? also what wifi card do you have?
2008-02-09T11:11:00.000Z	leprasmurf	Genius16	and the only way to fully shutdown at that point is to do a hard shutdown
2008-02-09T11:11:00.000Z	Genius16	leprasmurf	message me the error message?
2008-02-09T11:12:00.000Z	leprasmurf	Genius16	hang on, gotta find it
2008-02-09T11:12:00.000Z	Genius16	leprasmurf	 or spit it out here whatevers.
