2008-05-21T18:23:00.000Z	Slart	jokkaa	can't you use "last" and do some parsing with that?
2008-05-21T18:23:00.000Z	Slart	jokkaa	it won't be neat and tidy.. but it might work
2008-05-21T18:25:00.000Z	jokkaa	Slart	what is "last"? (feeling a bit noobie) mlr, ill check it out
2008-05-21T18:25:00.000Z	Slart	jokkaa	it's a terminal command that lists logins to the system.. with dates and times
2008-05-21T18:26:00.000Z	Slart	jokkaa	I don't think there's a way to do it from conky.. but you can use conky to run a command..or a script..
2008-05-21T18:26:00.000Z	jokkaa	Slart	ok.. hmm.. well i dunno rly, just felt like somethin ill like to have so ill try it out, thx for help anyways=9
2008-05-21T18:26:00.000Z	Slart	jokkaa	you're welcome
2008-05-21T18:27:00.000Z	jokkaa	Slart	the fun thing  is that when i start up with root, thats the first thing i see
2008-05-21T18:28:00.000Z	Slart	jokkaa	huh? how long you've been logged in? or the list of logged in users?
2008-05-21T18:28:00.000Z	Slart	jokkaa	you could use the "uptime" variable too.. unless you log in and out often
2008-05-21T18:28:00.000Z	jokkaa	Slart	going su root> conky then a conky window apears that shows me how long ive been logged in
2008-05-21T18:29:00.000Z	jokkaa		well i never shut my comp off
2008-05-21T18:29:00.000Z	Slart	jokkaa	that's the default conky config.. and you're not talking about how long you've been logged in.. you're talking about uptime.. ie how long the machine has been running
2008-05-21T18:30:00.000Z	jokkaa	Slart	well being logged in and my comp being on kinda goes hand in hand for me, but true different things they are. So question is, could i try finding the default conf and copy some lines from it?
2008-05-21T18:30:00.000Z	Slart	jokkaa	take a look here.. http://conky.sourceforge.net/variables.html
2008-05-21T18:31:00.000Z	Slart	jokkaa	you just insert a $uptime in the .conkyrc
2008-05-21T18:33:00.000Z	jokkaa	Slart	sweet page, gave me some reading and a few other things to set up xD
2008-05-21T18:34:00.000Z	Slart	jokkaa	hope you find something interesting
