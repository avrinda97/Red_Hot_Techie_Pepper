2009-12-15T04:36:00.000Z	luismendes		hello, how can I hear my own mic in ubuntu 9.10? input levels go up when I speak, in sound preferences, but I cannot hear myself. thanks
2009-12-15T04:37:00.000Z	graingert	luismendes	this is a silly idea
2009-12-15T04:37:00.000Z	graingert	luismendes	why would you want this? you would get massive feedback
2009-12-15T04:37:00.000Z	luismendes	graingert	still I'd like to do it
2009-12-15T04:37:00.000Z	graingert	luismendes	in pulseaudio you can loop it round
2009-12-15T04:37:00.000Z	luismendes	graingert	how is it done?
2009-12-15T04:37:00.000Z	graingert	luismendes	install all the pulseaudio cack, padevchooser and freinds
2009-12-15T04:38:00.000Z	graingert		!oem
2009-12-15T04:38:00.000Z	graingert		!oem | erty
2009-12-15T04:39:00.000Z	luismendes	graingert	it seems I've already have it installed, how can I configure it?
2009-12-15T04:39:00.000Z	graingert		run it and look in your gnome panel
2009-12-15T04:39:00.000Z	graingert	luismendes	^

2009-12-15T04:44:00.000Z	luismendes	graingert	ok but it looks the same as the sound preferences panel I already have
2009-12-15T04:45:00.000Z	graingert	luismendes	yes but it is more powerful
2009-12-15T04:45:00.000Z	luismendes	graingert	ok, but how can I hear my own mic? it looks the same
2009-12-15T04:45:00.000Z	graingert	luismendes	mess about with your imput and output streams
2009-12-15T04:46:00.000Z	graingert	luismendes	I can only point you in the right direction for your crankpot schemes
