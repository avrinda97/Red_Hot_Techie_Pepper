2010-01-07T06:31:00.000Z	Out_Cold		i hate my room mate.... every day i come home to find my server unplugged because he thinks it degrades his stupid wifi signal for his ps3.... what a flippin tool..
2010-01-07T06:32:00.000Z	Out_Cold		a headless machine with no lan is a useless machine
2010-01-07T06:33:00.000Z	hyperstream	Out_Cold	i hate people like that :P, at work they all run windows for web developement and this adobe software. i plug in and they believe that Ubuntu is better than windows there for get all the bandwidth(which i have nothing using it. perhaps Email check every 10 mins.) when infact they have slow net lol.
2010-01-07T06:35:00.000Z	Out_Cold	hyperstream	similar issues.... except this moron doesn't get that there are 2 seperate devices running in the router... one for wires and one without... i mean really.. how does a lan connection degrade signal strength???? i could understand if it was torrenting or something... but it just sits there... the only activity is when i back up files from work...
2010-01-07T06:36:00.000Z	hyperstream	Out_Cold	yeah, get him some stuff to read up on and slap him in the face and tell him to read...
2010-01-07T06:37:00.000Z	Out_Cold	hyperstream	i don't think he knows how to read... and if i did... i doubt he'd care...
2010-01-07T06:37:00.000Z	hyperstream	Out_Cold	disable the wireless.
2010-01-07T06:37:00.000Z	hyperstream	Out_Cold	change the encryption method
2010-01-07T06:37:00.000Z	Out_Cold	hyperstream	then he'd reset the router and all would be a waste...
2010-01-07T06:37:00.000Z	hyperstream	Out_Cold	its only a ps3 lol
2010-01-07T06:39:00.000Z	hyperstream	Out_Cold	interferance is generally caused by things like Fridge's and stuff, cordless phones
2010-01-07T06:39:00.000Z	Out_Cold	hyperstream	of which there is 2 walls, a fridge and a cordless phone between him and his COD4
2010-01-07T06:40:00.000Z	hyperstream	Out_Cold	EWW, cod4 on ps3, now thats mental. Mouse + Keyboard combo = win.
2010-01-07T06:40:00.000Z	hyperstream	Out_Cold	back in 2 mins, reboot
2010-01-07T06:55:00.000Z	hyperstream	Out_Cold	another suggestion if the 32bit disc fails, is to join #ubuntu+1 the next version in developement(Lucid 10.4 i think) when ever i have install/boot/graphic issues with any machines i install into(mainly laptops) i find that Lucid works out of the box where Karmic does not.
2010-01-07T06:56:00.000Z	Out_Cold	hyperstream	yea but there are always those bugs in progress
2010-01-07T06:56:00.000Z	hyperstream	Out_Cold	havnt hit one yet on 2 machines.
2010-01-07T06:57:00.000Z	hyperstream	Out_Cold	solved black screen start ups + audio + wifi issues :P
