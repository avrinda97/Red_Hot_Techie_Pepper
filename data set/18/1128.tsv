2011-05-23T15:17:00.000Z	baijupattera	hmuller	u meant on grub menu?
2011-05-23T15:18:00.000Z	hmuller	baijupattera	happens around that time alot
2011-05-23T15:18:00.000Z	baijupattera	hmuller	it happens in ubuntu 10.10
2011-05-23T15:19:00.000Z	baijupattera	hmuller	every update creates a new kernel hahaha
2011-05-23T15:19:00.000Z	hmuller	baijupattera	I did not have the problem until Natty
2011-05-23T15:19:00.000Z	hmuller	baijupattera	yes
2011-05-23T15:20:00.000Z	baijupattera	hmuller	it does not create any problem I think, coz the new and updated kernel appears on top and default
2011-05-23T15:21:00.000Z	hmuller	baijupattera	I am fully updated and am having the problem
2011-05-23T15:22:00.000Z	baijupattera	hmuller	how u reached to natty?  by upgrade or clean install?
2011-05-23T15:25:00.000Z	hmuller	baijupattera	clean install
2011-05-23T15:26:00.000Z	hmuller	baijupattera	I think I must have bug #712082 described onhttp://www.ubuntu.com/testing/natty/alpha2
2011-05-23T15:27:00.000Z	baijupattera	hmuller	whats the problem to u by this,is it not get booting?
2011-05-23T15:27:00.000Z	baijupattera	hmuller	SEE WHAT UBOTTU SAID
2011-05-23T15:28:00.000Z	hmuller	baijupattera	it will crash a random number of times, freezing. And then finally boot
2011-05-23T15:32:00.000Z	baijupattera	hmuller	I am so helpless, see in the www.askubuntu.com or ubuntu launchpad and come and repeat here
