2006-01-17T10:20:00.000Z	ajmitch	tolstoy	the led can be turned on
2006-01-17T10:21:00.000Z	tolstoy	ajmitch	with this old driver?  I don't even see anything in /sys/bus/pci/etc/etc/etc.
2006-01-17T10:22:00.000Z	ajmitch	tolstoy	hm, maybe not with the old driver :) - I'm using the ipw2200 driver
2006-01-17T10:23:00.000Z	tolstoy	ajmitch	yeah, the options ipw2200 led=1 trick is rejected with this driver.  I can live with it until the crack ubuntu staff sorts out the problem.
2006-01-17T10:23:00.000Z	ajmitch	tolstoy	aha, I'm using ipw2200 (in dapper) now with that option
2006-01-17T10:24:00.000Z	tolstoy	ajmitch	for some reason, neither dapper nor breezy work with the HP nw8240
2006-01-17T10:24:00.000Z	ajmitch	tolstoy	what issues, and are they fileed as bugs?
2006-01-17T10:25:00.000Z	tolstoy	ajmitch	https://launchpad.net/malone/bugs/6699
2006-01-17T10:25:00.000Z	tolstoy	ajmitch	I have no confidence I filed it correctly over there, so if you know what to do....
2006-01-17T10:27:00.000Z	ajmitch	tolstoy	ah, the problem being that malone hasn't been used for bugs filed in main - they're switching in the next week or so
2006-01-17T10:28:00.000Z	tolstoy	ajmitch	should I refile back in bugzilla? timfrost said they were turning that off within hours.
2006-01-17T10:28:00.000Z	ajmitch	tolstoy	yes, it's being switched very soon now
2006-01-17T10:29:00.000Z	tolstoy	ajmitch	should I refile in regular bugzilla?
2006-01-17T10:29:00.000Z	ajmitch	tolstoy	the fact that you get an ip via dhcp indicates that the wireless is certainly working to a degree
2006-01-17T10:29:00.000Z	ajmitch	tolstoy	probably not worth it
2006-01-17T10:29:00.000Z	tolstoy	ajmitch	I will if I get no changes or comments on that bug for a few days.
2006-01-17T10:30:00.000Z	ajmitch	tolstoy	you assume that every bug will be attended to in a few days
2006-01-17T10:31:00.000Z	tolstoy	ajmitch	yes!  and why not, be-damned!  Well, I'll revisit in a few days and see if I should prod or poke.
