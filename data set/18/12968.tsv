2006-02-22T16:44:00.000Z	chicken-man		Hi, I'm having problems starting gnome, I've just done a full install of ubuntu but after I login gnome displays a brown screen and will go no more, I get no errors I can see I'm using fluxbox at the moment, what should I do ?
2006-02-22T16:45:00.000Z	farous	chicken-man	ok look at a hidden file called .ICeauthority and see if you have write access to it
2006-02-22T16:46:00.000Z	chicken-man	farous	ok one moment
2006-02-22T16:46:00.000Z	farous	chicken-man	also look for.Xauthourit you should have full access to both
2006-02-22T16:47:00.000Z	chicken-man	farous	errrm how do I display hidden files using ls ?
2006-02-22T16:48:00.000Z	chicken-man	farous	I have Read \ Write access to them
2006-02-22T16:51:00.000Z	chicken-man	farous	Do I have to be able to execute them ...... ?
