2010-04-23T12:27:00.000Z	Klevre		I have a Ubuntu version running in virtual PC and I forgot the root user password. Is there any way to retrieve/reset it?
2010-04-23T12:27:00.000Z	theadmin	Klevre	There is no root password
2010-04-23T12:29:00.000Z	Klevre	theadmin	Oh, I thought I changed password.
2010-04-23T12:37:00.000Z	theadmin	Klevre	There are no such tools.
2010-04-23T12:37:00.000Z	theadmin	Klevre	What are you using, VMWare?
2010-04-23T12:38:00.000Z	theadmin	Klevre	...yuck. Use VirtualBox, has much better support for Linux guests.
2010-04-23T12:38:00.000Z	Klevre	theadmin	Free?
2010-04-23T12:39:00.000Z	theadmin	Klevre	Totally. see www.virtualbox.org
2010-04-23T12:42:00.000Z	Klevre	theadmin	That sounds great, coding on 800x600 is a pain.
2010-04-23T12:42:00.000Z	theadmin	Klevre	It supports nearly every system as guest with nearly every system as host :D
2010-04-23T12:42:00.000Z	theadmin	Klevre	Why not a normal install, though?
2010-04-23T12:43:00.000Z	Klevre	theadmin	Only have one PC atm.
2010-04-23T12:43:00.000Z	theadmin	Klevre	...So, resize ntfs partition and dual-boot, just like I do.
2010-04-23T12:43:00.000Z	theadmin	Klevre	Indeed :D also look into andLinux, which is an Ubuntu designed to run inside Windows.
2010-04-23T12:47:00.000Z	Klevre	theadmin	32-bit versions only it seems.
2010-04-23T12:47:00.000Z	theadmin	Klevre	andLinux? Yeah o_O indeed, forgot it
2010-04-23T12:48:00.000Z	theadmin	Klevre	^W !!
2010-04-23T12:49:00.000Z	theadmin	Klevre	Or, rather, !-2
