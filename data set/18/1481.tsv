2011-02-23T06:53:00.000Z	Teligard		hello
2011-02-23T06:54:00.000Z	Teligard		I was wondering if anyone has had issues where their floppy and hard drives go through a seek check about 20 times after logging in
2011-02-23T06:54:00.000Z	Teligard		additionally, I run into a similiar issue with the login audio
2011-02-23T06:54:00.000Z	Teligard		(it plays over itself several times)
2011-02-23T06:55:00.000Z	Teligard		I'm running 10.10 x64, kernel 2.6.35-26-generic
2011-02-23T06:56:00.000Z	Teligard		It started after allowing a system update that got stuck setting the kernel
2011-02-23T06:56:00.000Z	sacarlson	Teligard	sounds like you might have a irq conflict,  lets see your sudo lshw
2011-02-23T06:57:00.000Z	Teligard	sacarlson	working on getting that for you
2011-02-23T06:58:00.000Z	Teligard	sacarlson	where do you want it posted?
2011-02-23T07:01:00.000Z	Teligard	sacarlson	Still, apparently, generating for SCSI
2011-02-23T07:05:00.000Z	Teligard	sacarlson	Still, apparently, generating for SCSI
2011-02-23T07:06:00.000Z	sacarlson	Teligard	sounds like you found your conflicting device
2011-02-23T07:06:00.000Z	Teligard	sacarlson	I think that somehow the process hung
2011-02-23T07:06:00.000Z	sacarlson	Teligard	is scsi a build in thing?
2011-02-23T07:07:00.000Z	Teligard	sacarlson	I don't know
2011-02-23T07:07:00.000Z	Teligard	sacarlson	I's assuming it's identifying SATA as SCSI
2011-02-23T07:08:00.000Z	sacarlson	Teligard	try reboot and try again,  if it fails again start to turn devices off in bios until it works
2011-02-23T07:09:00.000Z	Teligard	sacarlson	ok
