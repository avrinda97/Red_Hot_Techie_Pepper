2007-08-07T10:52:00.000Z	kmasta		my GRUB boot menu is showing I have like 3 versions of ubuntu on my harddrive, i'm using fiesty now, how do I get rid of the old ones. i think they're taking up room on my HD
2007-08-07T10:52:00.000Z	pike_	kmasta	gksu gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst
2007-08-07T10:52:00.000Z	kmasta	pike_	but won't they still be taking up space on my hD
2007-08-07T10:52:00.000Z	pike_	kmasta	you mean the kernel versions?
2007-08-07T10:53:00.000Z	kmasta		yea yea
2007-08-07T10:53:00.000Z	kmasta		they're previous kernel installs
2007-08-07T10:53:00.000Z	pike_	kmasta	you can use the package manager to remove em or just delete em from /boot
2007-08-07T10:53:00.000Z	pike_	kmasta	synaptic is best prob
2007-08-07T10:54:00.000Z	kmasta	pike_	what do I look for in synaptic
2007-08-07T10:55:00.000Z	pike_	kmasta	search for linux-image   itll be selected if installed and just uncheck whichever you want to remove
2007-08-07T10:55:00.000Z	kmasta	pike_	so I can uninstall all the kernals except the latest one
2007-08-07T10:55:00.000Z	pike_	kmasta	yeah
2007-08-07T10:56:00.000Z	kmasta	pike_	mark for removal or mark for complete removal
2007-08-07T10:56:00.000Z	pike_	kmasta	ive not used synaptic.. id guess 'complete removal' is maybe --purge? but im not sure
2007-08-07T10:57:00.000Z	kmasta	pike_	should i just do it in cli then?
2007-08-07T10:58:00.000Z	pike_	kmasta	thats what id do. just dpkg -l | grep linux-image  then sudo apt-get remove the ones you dont want in that list
2007-08-07T10:58:00.000Z	kmasta	pike_	ah here's the difference. complete removal removes all dependancies
2007-08-07T11:01:00.000Z	kmasta	pike_	remove completely purges and then removes all the dependancies
