2006-05-05T15:19:00.000Z	rafflesdude		was wonderin how to change the settings of a document (removin read only) status
2006-05-05T15:20:00.000Z	dli	rafflesdude	try the file browser ( nautilus)
2006-05-05T15:20:00.000Z	dli	rafflesdude	if you still want more, "man chmod", like "chmod +w foo"
2006-05-05T15:21:00.000Z	dli	rafflesdude	okay, you can "sudo chmod a+w foo"
2006-05-05T15:22:00.000Z	dli	rafflesdude	don't change any system files, only change your own
2006-05-05T15:23:00.000Z	dli	rafflesdude	don't do chmod to change resolution, try "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg"
2006-05-05T15:25:00.000Z	dli	rafflesdude	ask here before you do something to the system, or read a howto
2006-05-05T15:25:00.000Z	dli	rafflesdude	Ctl-C here, and Ctl-Shift-V in gnome-terminal
2006-05-05T15:27:00.000Z	dli	rafflesdude	followinig the wiki is a good way
2006-05-05T15:27:00.000Z	dli	rafflesdude	you got 855, I see
2006-05-05T15:30:00.000Z	dli	rafflesdude	and 855resolution?
2006-05-05T15:31:00.000Z	dli	rafflesdude	are you sure you set enable video for video in bios? like more than 8MB
2006-05-05T15:32:00.000Z	dli	rafflesdude	sudo 855resolution -l
2006-05-05T15:32:00.000Z	dli	rafflesdude	anything more than 640x480?
2006-05-05T15:33:00.000Z	dli	rafflesdude	check bios, reboot, enter bios, find out howmuch video ram is reserved, make it larger than 8MB
