2009-03-02T01:19:00.000Z	Dizzle		Can anyone help with a wireless issue?
2009-03-02T01:20:00.000Z	Dizzle		Network manager just hangs when it says 'attempting to join the wireless network 'xxxxxx''
2009-03-02T01:21:00.000Z	Dizzle		Does anyone know where I can at least find the logs for network manager?
2009-03-02T01:23:00.000Z	redvamp128	Dizzle	 system logs and then daemon.log shoudl give you network things
2009-03-02T01:28:00.000Z	redvamp128	Dizzle	 if you are having connection issues with the network manager you could try using the sudo ifdown eth# (whichever the card number is) then the sudo ifup eht# sometimes that will get it on when network manager can't
2009-03-02T01:29:00.000Z	redvamp128	Dizzle	 it is like windows --  ipconfig /release then ipconfig /renew
2009-03-02T01:30:00.000Z	redvamp128	Dizzle	 basically the ifdown forces it off -- then the ifup makes it come back
2009-03-02T01:31:00.000Z	redvamp128	Dizzle	 try lshw -short  and also ifconfig should tell you what wireless is
2009-03-02T01:35:00.000Z	redvamp128	Dizzle	 give me a second to find this out for him
2009-03-02T01:39:00.000Z	redvamp128	Dizzle	 even with the force it still gives you that error
2009-03-02T01:40:00.000Z	redvamp128	Dizzle	 try this one sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart  then try the sudo ifup eth0
2009-03-02T01:42:00.000Z	redvamp128	Dizzle	 try this  sudo lshw -C network
2009-03-02T01:43:00.000Z	redvamp128	Dizzle	 is the card listed there
2009-03-02T01:45:00.000Z	redvamp128	Dizzle	 I am looking at the help file and it should be working  --  usually the sudo ifdown force eth(0,1) then the sudo ifup eth(0,1) and it usually gets online when network manger fails
2009-03-02T01:46:00.000Z	redvamp128	Dizzle	 silly suggestion -- any way to reboot the access point?
2009-03-02T01:46:00.000Z	redvamp128	Dizzle	 At my work I have to reboot one ap at least once every 2 weeks.
2009-03-02T01:47:00.000Z	redvamp128	Dizzle	 hold on going to look up the flush dns for ubuntu
2009-03-02T01:48:00.000Z	redvamp128	Dizzle	 try this one sudo /etc/init.d/dns-clean start
