2009-06-01T16:54:00.000Z	livingdaylight	zortec	hi
2009-06-01T16:55:00.000Z	zortec	livingdaylight	Hi, do you have a question?
2009-06-01T16:55:00.000Z	livingdaylight	zortec	no, why?
2009-06-01T16:55:00.000Z	zortec	livingdaylight	You keep saying hi :)
2009-06-01T16:56:00.000Z	livingdaylight	zortec	just being friendly, but you keep ignoring me :(
2009-06-01T16:56:00.000Z	zortec	livingdaylight	I didn't mean to ignore you, just been trying to get ubuntu installed on my system for 2 days
2009-06-01T16:57:00.000Z	livingdaylight	zortec	hence your fuse is a bit short... ic
2009-06-01T16:58:00.000Z	livingdaylight	zortec	you should get entry into world guinness book of records.. I would've thought it impossible to take that long... took me about 20minutes
2009-06-01T16:59:00.000Z	zortec	livingdaylight	It really shouldn't take that long, but I have a graphics card that is not supported on the live cd or rather I can't get access to the packages I need to run it
2009-06-01T16:59:00.000Z	livingdaylight	zortec	shux... agues you hadn't had linux in mind at the time of building your machine?
2009-06-01T16:59:00.000Z	zortec	livingdaylight	I actually had windows/linux in mind when I built the computer
2009-06-01T17:04:00.000Z	livingdaylight	zortec	it might be quicker to return or resale your graphics card and get one that is supported out of the box?
2009-06-01T17:04:00.000Z	zortec	livingdaylight	It is integrated.  I can't sell it, lol.
2009-06-01T17:05:00.000Z	zortec	livingdaylight	But I can replace it with a PCI-E card.
2009-06-01T17:05:00.000Z	livingdaylight	zortec	yea!
2009-06-01T17:05:00.000Z	livingdaylight	zortec	integrated is never as good as dedicated anyhow
