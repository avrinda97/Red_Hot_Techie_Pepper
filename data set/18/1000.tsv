2011-07-09T15:45:00.000Z	oCean	yukos_	did you use  "rfkill list"  (no quotes)
2011-07-09T15:45:00.000Z	yukos_	oCean	sorry, http://pastebin.com/cFkSVLKZ
2011-07-09T15:47:00.000Z	oCean	yukos_	some are still blocked. Running   "sudo rfkill unblock all"  should, well.. unblock all
2011-07-09T15:49:00.000Z	yukos_	oCean	now it says "device not ready"
2011-07-09T15:50:00.000Z	oCean	yukos_	where does it say that?
2011-07-09T15:50:00.000Z	yukos_	oCean	under "wireless network" in system tray menu
2011-07-09T15:51:00.000Z	oCean	yukos_	first try the "rfkill list" again to see if all options are no longer blocked
2011-07-09T15:52:00.000Z	yukos_	oCean	makes sens :) anyway software is still blocking?! iulian@ubuntu:~$ rfkill list 0: acer-wireless: Wireless LAN  Soft blocked: yes  Hard blocked: no 1: phy0: Wireless LAN  Soft blocked: no  Hard blocked: no 2: sony-wifi: Wireless LAN  Soft blocked: no  Hard blocked: no 3: sony-bluetooth: Bluetooth  Soft blocked: no  Hard blocked: no 8: hci0: Bluetooth  Soft blocked: no  Hard blocked: no

2011-07-09T15:54:00.000Z	yukos_	oCean	shall I make a restart?
2011-07-09T15:54:00.000Z	oCean	yukos_	hm, indeed there's still a (soft)block, I don't know why. Try "sudo rfkill unblock 0" (seems redundant to me, but it's worth a try)
2011-07-09T15:55:00.000Z	oCean	yukos_	sure you can try, but I don't think it should be necessary
2011-07-09T15:55:00.000Z	yukos_	oCean	sudo rfkill unlbock 0 didn't change anything
2011-07-09T15:56:00.000Z	oCean	yukos_	ok. Sorry, I'm not sure what to do then
2011-07-09T15:56:00.000Z	yukos_	oCean	thx for your help
2011-07-09T15:57:00.000Z	oCean	yukos_	what's your ubuntu version?
