2008-05-14T22:23:00.000Z	bobboy		Hello Ubuntu community :D, I am having a little noobish problem with updating and was wondering if someone would be able to answer a couple questions?
2008-05-14T22:24:00.000Z	m1r	bobboy	!ask
2008-05-14T22:28:00.000Z	m1r	bobboy	apt-get dist-upgrade
2008-05-14T22:28:00.000Z	bobboy	m1r	im in hardy heron
2008-05-14T22:29:00.000Z	m1r	bobboy	, try this command> apt-get update && apt-get dist-upgrade
2008-05-14T22:32:00.000Z	bobboy	m1r	k they both give the same package results and vary in size only by about 800kb.. one other problem is why is it trying to install an update for transmission when i uninstalled it and am using qBitTorrent?
2008-05-14T22:34:00.000Z	bobboy	m1r	ok
2008-05-14T22:39:00.000Z	m1r	bobboy	apt-get remove --purge transmission
2008-05-14T22:40:00.000Z	bobboy	m1r	 is that the command that delete the program AND the config files? are am i getting them confused?
2008-05-14T22:40:00.000Z	m1r	bobboy	it will purge all transmission data
2008-05-14T22:42:00.000Z	bobboy	m1r	tried the command and it said Package transmission is not installed, so not removed
2008-05-14T22:44:00.000Z	m1r	bobboy	then it shouldnt recive any transmission data on upgrade
2008-05-14T22:44:00.000Z	bobboy	m1r	The following NEW packages will be installed:
2008-05-14T22:45:00.000Z	bobboy	m1r	did you see that or did the floodbot1 delete it? lol
2008-05-14T22:48:00.000Z	bobboy	m1r	yes the transmission-common package is still isntalled and marked as upgradable
2008-05-14T22:54:00.000Z	bobboy	m1r	i think synaptic froze maybe? lol.. its just hanging there saying Removing transmission-common and the file is only 56.7kb and im on a 1.5ghz dual core, 2 gb ram computer
2008-05-14T22:54:00.000Z	bobboy	m1r	nvm there it goes.. heres goes with the apt-get update
2008-05-14T22:56:00.000Z	bobboy	m1r	how do you know when to use dist-upgrade or just upgrade?
