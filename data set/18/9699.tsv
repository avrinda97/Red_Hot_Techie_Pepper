2007-04-02T07:43:00.000Z	chasetoys		what am i supposed to do?
2007-04-02T07:44:00.000Z	bimberi	chasetoys	was that an apt-get?  try re-running it.
2007-04-02T07:45:00.000Z	chasetoys	bimberi	i'm worried it will core dump again
2007-04-02T07:45:00.000Z	bimberi	chasetoys	but it might not
2007-04-02T07:46:00.000Z	chasetoys		hehe
2007-04-02T07:46:00.000Z	bimberi		:)
2007-04-02T07:46:00.000Z	bimberi	chasetoys	it should resume downloading from where it left off
2007-04-02T07:46:00.000Z	chasetoys	bimberi	oh but its not
2007-04-02T07:46:00.000Z	chasetoys		;(  another hour
2007-04-02T07:47:00.000Z	bimberi	chasetoys	:(  (i was defensive using "should" because I don't know whether the core dump means it won't)
2007-04-02T07:48:00.000Z	chasetoys	bimberi	core dumps scare me...... reminds of college days
2007-04-02T07:49:00.000Z	bimberi	chasetoys	alternatively, get a URL via packages.ubuntu.com and download using 'wget -c <url>'
2007-04-02T07:49:00.000Z	chasetoys	bimberi	well ive already downloaded ecipse form their site.. but notw its a matter of dloading jVM
2007-04-02T07:50:00.000Z	bimberi	chasetoys	you can install eclipse via the package manager (unless there is a later version you want)
2007-04-02T07:51:00.000Z	chasetoys	bimberi	well i tped: sudo apt-get install eclispe-sdk .... and i was left without a JVM
2007-04-02T07:52:00.000Z	bimberi	chasetoys	yes it probably only brings in the jre as a dependency
