2009-02-08T18:51:00.000Z	ed_		hi, am i going mad? where has the count program gone?
2009-02-08T18:51:00.000Z	jrib	ed_	what count program?
2009-02-08T18:51:00.000Z	ed_	jrib	ya know, cat files | sort | count
2009-02-08T18:52:00.000Z	jrib	ed_	you mean wc?
2009-02-08T18:52:00.000Z	ed_	jrib	no, that tells you characters, `count` prefixes each line wiht the number of times it appears consecutively
2009-02-08T18:52:00.000Z	ed_	jrib	yes, its nothing like wc
2009-02-08T18:53:00.000Z	jrib	ed_	well what do you want count to do?
2009-02-08T18:53:00.000Z	ed_	jrib	suppose the file contains abc\ndef\ndef, the count output is 1\tabc\n2\tdef
2009-02-08T18:59:00.000Z	jrib	ed_	cat does this
2009-02-08T18:59:00.000Z	jrib	ed_	and nl
2009-02-08T18:59:00.000Z	ed_	jrib	bad example
2009-02-08T18:59:00.000Z	jrib	ed_	eh?
2009-02-08T19:00:00.000Z	ed_	jrib	suppose the file contains abc\ndef\ndef\n123\n123, the count output is 1\tabc\n2\tdef\n2\t123
2009-02-08T19:00:00.000Z	jrib	ed_	cat does this (more specifically with -n).  And nl also does this
2009-02-08T19:01:00.000Z	jrib	ed_	you want to number the lines right?
2009-02-08T19:01:00.000Z	ed_	jrib	that just prefixes a line number. its not the same as outputting the number of times the string appears in the file
2009-02-08T19:01:00.000Z	jrib	ed_	ah
2009-02-08T19:01:00.000Z	jrib	ed_	uniq
