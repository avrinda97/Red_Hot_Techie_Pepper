2009-12-06T07:49:00.000Z	gdiz		hey everyone I am looking to set up playing music on my ubuntu box using another computer via wifi.  I thought mpd might be a good solution.  So I was wondering if any of you have any opinions of mpd and if you know of a good web server front ends so that I could play my music via the ubuntu box and via the other computer.
2009-12-06T07:50:00.000Z	gdiz		anonymous2, rhythmbox can be a front end to mpd?
2009-12-06T07:51:00.000Z	gdiz		anonymous2, I have been doing some research on music player daemon
2009-12-06T07:52:00.000Z	gdiz		oh ok
2009-12-06T07:53:00.000Z	gdiz		anonymous2, ok, so how do you go about controlling an ubuntu box via another computer?
2009-12-06T07:53:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	gdiz	Install sshd on the server and set up publickey auth?
2009-12-06T07:55:00.000Z	gdiz	Mike_lifeguard	sorry bad phrasing: controlling in reference to controlling music
2009-12-06T07:56:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	gdiz	Sure, you can ssh in and use some music server
2009-12-06T07:57:00.000Z	gdiz	Mike_lifeguard	the problem that I have been having is that I have been having trouble accessing via shell.  Maybe it's the program, but I have no idea how to control rhythmbox via shell.
2009-12-06T07:59:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	gdiz	ew, don't use rhythmbox, use mpd
2009-12-06T07:59:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	gdiz	and ncpmc
2009-12-06T08:02:00.000Z	gdiz	Mike_lifeguard	oh ok, so I am very new to this: is ncpmc a form of mpd or something that goes on top of mpd
2009-12-06T08:03:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	gdiz	mpd is the music server (database of your music etc); ncpmc is the music client (what you as the user interact with - choosing what to play etc)
2009-12-06T08:04:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	gdiz	There are other options, but that's what I'd recommend. Note that ubuntu's default setup for mpd is *not good*, so you will have to tweak it
2009-12-06T08:05:00.000Z	gdiz	Mike_lifeguard	what isn't so hot about it?
2009-12-06T08:06:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	gdiz	It assumes you want it to be system-wide, which you probably don't. So, for example, it starts mpd on start-up, but pointing at a location that has no music in it (ie the systemwide location) -- whereas you want it to not start at boot time so you can start it when you need it and it will use ~/.mpd/mpd.conf which you will configure correctly to point at your music library
2009-12-06T08:11:00.000Z	Mike_lifeguard	gdiz	yeah, it takes a bit of getting used to, but it definitely works (and incredibly stable!)
2009-12-06T08:13:00.000Z	gdiz	Mike_lifeguard	great
