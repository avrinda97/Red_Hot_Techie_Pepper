2007-06-19T06:03:00.000Z	Zack		Hi I need to know how to Mount my Ipod...
2007-06-19T06:03:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Zack	If it is FAT 32 then it should just mount automatically
2007-06-19T06:06:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Zack	OK, make a mount point for it, like: sudo mkdir /media/ipod
2007-06-19T06:08:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Zack	Then figure out the device name for your ipod by running: mount
2007-06-19T06:08:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Zack	That is not the command to put into Amerok, that is just the first step to mounting something
2007-06-19T06:09:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Zack	I don't use Amarok so I don't know if it wants something different, I was just going to give you the normal *nix command for mounting your ipod
2007-06-19T10:59:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Zack	Are you sure that the program you want is not available from a repository or .deb?
2007-06-24T06:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Zack	Are you sure that you need to install from source?
2007-06-24T06:06:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Zack	libvisual-0.4-0 Is available in the repos
2007-07-13T12:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Zack	What kind of command line?
2007-07-13T12:24:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Zack	What is the name of the command?
2007-07-13T12:25:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Zack	beryl-manager
2010-11-25T08:48:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Zack	That small partition is called the system partition, "C:" is not the system partition. No, the system partition is required for windows to boot.
2010-11-25T08:49:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Zack	Yes.
2010-11-25T08:49:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Zack	You're welcome.
2010-11-25T08:52:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Zack	To make it easier to share one /home with multiple distributions.
2010-11-25T09:07:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Zack	No, neither.
2010-11-25T09:08:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Zack	You should select the mbr, which would be something like "/dev/sda" rather than something like "/dev/sda1".
