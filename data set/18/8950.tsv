2008-03-03T17:50:00.000Z	ManuP		hi. can someone connect via ftp to 84.58.191.152 as user ftp and pw ftp and check if it works?
2008-03-03T17:51:00.000Z	ManuP		i can not test locally if passv works.
2008-03-03T17:52:00.000Z	onexused	ManuP	looks fine to me
2008-03-03T17:52:00.000Z	ManuP	onexused	you have passive-mode?
2008-03-03T17:52:00.000Z	onexused	ManuP	I'm not sure : /
2008-03-03T17:53:00.000Z	ManuP	onexused	how did you connect?
2008-03-03T17:53:00.000Z	ManuP	onexused	type passv
2008-03-03T17:54:00.000Z	onexused	ManuP	pasv = ?Invalid command ;  passv = ?Invalid command
2008-03-03T17:54:00.000Z	ManuP	onexused	oh, try passive
2008-03-03T17:55:00.000Z	onexused	ManuP	Passive mode on.
2008-03-03T17:55:00.000Z	ManuP	onexused	and then try dir
2008-03-03T17:55:00.000Z	onexused	ManuP	No control connection for command: Success  /n  Passive mode refused.
2008-03-03T17:56:00.000Z	onexused	ManuP	I reconnected and did passive right away.  This time ls and dir work.
2008-03-03T17:56:00.000Z	ManuP	onexused	what exactly did you do? if i try passive and dir, it hangs up.
2008-03-03T17:57:00.000Z	onexused	ManuP	let me paste it
2008-03-03T17:57:00.000Z	ManuP	onexused	k
2008-03-03T17:59:00.000Z	onexused	ManuP	 http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/58244/
2008-03-03T18:00:00.000Z	ManuP	onexused	that only means then, that i can not connect to my own ftp-server.
