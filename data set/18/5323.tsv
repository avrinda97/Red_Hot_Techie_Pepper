2009-04-30T10:34:00.000Z	Roasted		I see theres still severe video tearing in 9.04 too with DVDs. *sigh*
2009-04-30T10:34:00.000Z	Roasted		I love ubuntu, but GAHHH
2009-04-30T10:35:00.000Z	Roasted		gnome
2009-04-30T10:36:00.000Z	Roasted		8.10
2009-04-30T10:38:00.000Z	Roasted		it seems as if exaile is working with youtube... how weird...
2009-04-30T10:38:00.000Z	Roasted		how can Ig et amarok 2 to respond the same way?
2009-04-30T10:39:00.000Z	fde	Roasted	what are you trying to do?
2009-04-30T10:40:00.000Z	fde	Roasted	don't mind him... its just different, no features are lost
2009-04-30T10:40:00.000Z	Roasted	fde	- I can't get youtube audio and amarok2 to work at the same time. with amarok1 I had to change an engine setting. But now with amarok2 I cant find it.
2009-04-30T10:40:00.000Z	Roasted	fde	- then how can I change engine settings in amarok2?
2009-04-30T10:41:00.000Z	fde	Roasted	install the xine pulse plugin, and ensure phonon is using xine
2009-04-30T10:41:00.000Z	Roasted	fde	- the xine pulse plugin... so that magically gives me more amarok2 settings to change the engine? or what?
2009-04-30T10:42:00.000Z	fde	Roasted	Amarok2 uses KDE4 settings... thus it uses Phonon... so if the phonon backend is using xine that has a pulse plugin, it won't complain with Flash as that too uses Pulse as of 10.x
2009-04-30T10:43:00.000Z	Roasted	fde	- Amarok2 and KDE... Blah.
2009-04-30T10:43:00.000Z	fde	Roasted	yes... I got that part
2009-04-30T10:43:00.000Z	fde	Roasted	idk, that's how I set up phonon, and I never had issues... except the various plasma leaks
2009-04-30T10:45:00.000Z	fde	Roasted	I told you how to fix amarok2, either do what I said or stop asking the same question.
2009-04-30T10:45:00.000Z	Roasted	fde	- yeah, I got that, thanks.
