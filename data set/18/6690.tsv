2008-04-10T08:17:00.000Z	NoTownKasper		Speaking of questions, here's my latest. So I themed my whole gui practically, to work with the 'overglossed' color theme from Gnome-look. Splash screens...cursors, everything. But, when I boot, after the gdm themed login, there's about a 3 second spot, while the gnome splash is telling me everything's loading...that's still the bright orangish barf-color and even the system>Administration>login window>local setting to change back
