2011-09-12T00:13:00.000Z	Polah	Shogoot	change 01 on your line to */1, currently it's running at one minute past every hour.

2011-09-12T00:29:00.000Z	Polah	Shogoot	That makes more than one file? Strange, there's nothing on the line to tell it to do that, unless wget automatically picks up that it has a number and used it before
2011-09-12T00:31:00.000Z	Shogoot	Polah	no, its not making a second file Crontab is working but the command is not allowing to overwrite the existing file (when it executed for the second time from crontab).
2011-09-12T00:31:00.000Z	Polah	Shogoot	What does it say when it tries to overwrite?
2011-09-12T00:31:00.000Z	Shogoot	Polah	imnot getting any error...
2011-09-12T00:34:00.000Z	Shogoot	Polah	will try
