2012-09-25T04:24:00.000Z	jhkier		anyone got insight into this one ? sorry for bombing into the conversation.
2012-09-25T04:25:00.000Z	ampd	jhkier	what are you asking, what editor to use?
2012-09-25T04:26:00.000Z	jhkier	ampd	well yes I guess... but its a VM... so I'm more interested in the process. it seems a bit mental to VNC into ubuntu and then launch an editor... how does everyone else do this #Noob
2012-09-25T04:27:00.000Z	ampd	jhkier	vim?
2012-09-25T04:28:00.000Z	ampd	jhkier	if you want a gui, i've used bluefish before and it was ok
2012-09-25T04:28:00.000Z	ampd	jhkier	i'd try vim though
2012-09-25T04:28:00.000Z	jhkier	ampd	Is Vim just a terminal editor?  - I'm presuming bluefish is something which I run from the ubuntu desktop?
2012-09-25T04:29:00.000Z	ampd	jhkier	yea, vim is terminal, bluefish is targeted towards web dev
2012-09-25T04:30:00.000Z	ampd	jhkier	bluefish is full on gui development
2012-09-25T04:32:00.000Z	jhkier	ampd	so bluefish would have a full copy of the site on my desktop and push the files up everytime.
2012-09-25T04:32:00.000Z	ampd	jhkier	here's some movies on what it does: http://bluefish.openoffice.nl/screenshots.html
2012-09-25T04:33:00.000Z	ampd	jhkier	it does have site upload/download i guess, havent used it though
2012-09-25T04:34:00.000Z	jhkier	ampd	yeah.. no linux on desktop.. that might be.
2012-09-25T04:35:00.000Z	ampd	jhkier	why cant you edit files on your computer and push them to the remote machine fi thats where you want them
2012-09-25T04:37:00.000Z	ampd	jhkier	just edit them in windows and upload them to the server. Bluefish has a windows client if you need to do that
2012-09-25T04:37:00.000Z	ampd	jhkier	or learn vim, it's pretty useful
2012-09-25T04:38:00.000Z	jhkier	ampd	i think you're right about editing them on my machine and pushing up to the server.... I think my initial question was trying to align this..
2012-09-25T04:45:00.000Z	ampd	jhkier	check pm
