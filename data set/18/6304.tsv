2009-03-13T00:23:00.000Z	CQ		I have a subversion repository set up with ownership www-data.www-data, and I'm in the www-data group, but it says I don't have privs to create the lockfile in db ... the dir is set rwxr-sr-x ...
2009-03-13T00:23:00.000Z	CQ		does that need to be rws?
2009-03-13T00:23:00.000Z	ikonia	CQ	what is the dir for the lock file ,and yes it needs to be writable
2009-05-15T21:32:00.000Z	CQ	ikonia	shouldn't xorg autodetect all that stuff?
2009-05-15T21:33:00.000Z	ikonia	CQ	should / sometimes doesn't
2009-05-15T21:33:00.000Z	CQ	ikonia	xrandr shows the VGA with all correct modes, but also shows HDMI-1 disconnected (normal left inverted right x axis y axis)
2009-05-15T21:33:00.000Z	ikonia	CQ	what video card is it on ?
2009-05-15T21:35:00.000Z	CQ	ikonia	MSI G45M Motherboard (MS7521) so Intel G45 I guess
2009-05-15T21:36:00.000Z	CQ	ikonia	pastebin a Xorg.0.log and a Xorg.afilsafe.log?
2009-05-15T21:36:00.000Z	ikonia	CQ	interesting, the intel cards are normally quite good with detection
2009-05-15T21:38:00.000Z	CQ	ikonia	I tried to dpkg-reconfigure the xserver, but no change, my /etc/X11/xorg.conf is standard
