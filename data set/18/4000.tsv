2009-07-14T23:21:00.000Z	amikrop		Hello. I am on Ubuntu 9.04, I run Pidgin 2.5.5 and Pidgin-Audacious 2.0.0 doesn't work. It just doesn't change my status.
2009-07-14T23:22:00.000Z	amikrop		Any help, plase?

2009-07-14T23:23:00.000Z	balloooza	amikrop	you do not need to say it multiple times
2009-07-14T23:23:00.000Z	amikrop	balloooza	excuse me
2009-07-14T23:24:00.000Z	amikrop	balloooza	any help, by the way? :-)
2009-07-14T23:24:00.000Z	balloooza	amikrop	is this audacious po=ligin a thing that says what song you are listening to by any chance?
2009-07-14T23:25:00.000Z	amikrop	balloooza	yes
2009-07-14T23:25:00.000Z	amikrop	balloooza	it is a pidgin plugin, btw, not an audacious one
2009-07-14T23:25:00.000Z	balloooza	amikrop	and you are listening to the music on audacious, and not rythmbox (right, kinda obvious)
2009-07-14T23:25:00.000Z	amikrop	balloooza	yes
2009-07-14T23:27:00.000Z	balloooza	amikrop	I have not used this before, so I guess I can't help much, but a good way to figure out exactly what the problem is, is to go to the website for the project (google it will usualy do it) and then read how to set it up, and see where things start going wrong, if it is a pidgen PLUGIN, then you might need to change the settings in pigden
2009-07-14T23:28:00.000Z	amikrop	balloooza	I have set Pidgin to let this plugin to update my status but it doesn't do so. Anyway, I will look at their website, thank you. :)
2009-07-14T23:29:00.000Z	balloooza	amikrop	just had an idea, if you go into pidgen, and then go to status (a drop down menu) is there an option for "my song"
2009-07-14T23:30:00.000Z	amikrop	balloooza	no
2009-07-14T23:30:00.000Z	amikrop	balloooza	Here is what I found, though: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/pidgin-audacious/+bug/217949
2009-07-14T23:32:00.000Z	balloooza	amikrop	read the second to last post in the launchpad
2009-07-14T23:33:00.000Z	amikrop	balloooza	Yeah, I did so. I guess I won't get into such trouble, I 'll wait for an official fix. Thanks, though. :-)
