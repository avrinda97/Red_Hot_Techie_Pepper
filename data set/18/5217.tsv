2008-11-24T16:29:00.000Z	mclure	t3mper	it tries to access a folder that does not exist. perhaps I should try to reinstall openoffice with purge?

2008-11-24T16:33:00.000Z	t3mper	mclure	try saving something, browsing to an existing folder. close oo, open it again and see if the problem still there.

2008-11-24T16:34:00.000Z	mclure	t3mper	when I try to save it anyway it says it needs openoffice.org-java-common. really neccessary? nope. that's not my username. but I
2008-11-24T16:34:00.000Z	t3mper	mclure	that's weird. what's your username?
2008-11-24T16:35:00.000Z	mclure	t3mper	I'm using eeebuntu on a eeepc 901. perhaps something wrong with that system. can be solved if I reinstall openoffice with purge?
2008-11-24T16:35:00.000Z	t3mper	mclure	probably. is it a fresh install?
2008-11-24T16:36:00.000Z	mclure	t3mper	yep. btw. installing openoffice.org-java-common didn
2008-11-24T16:36:00.000Z	mclure	t3mper	didn't change anything
2008-11-24T16:37:00.000Z	t3mper	mclure	don't really know about an eee-pc setup. what version of ubuntu are you using?
