2006-09-19T07:13:00.000Z	joebu23		anyone know why my pcmcia network card would stop working after a kernel  update today to 2.6.15-27?
2006-09-19T07:14:00.000Z	chuckyp	joebu23	what type of card?
2006-09-19T07:14:00.000Z	joebu23	chuckyp	d-link, using atheros driver
2006-09-19T07:14:00.000Z	chuckyp	joebu23	oh you know what perhaps you need the linux-restricted-modules for the new kernel you are running.
2006-09-19T07:14:00.000Z	chuckyp	joebu23	how'd you get the atheros driver?
2006-09-19T07:14:00.000Z	chuckyp	joebu23	originally?
2006-09-19T07:15:00.000Z	chuckyp	joebu23	did it work out of the box or did you have to do something to get it working.
2006-09-19T07:15:00.000Z	joebu23	chuckyp	it worked out of the box as ath0 until today when i did an update on the kernel
2006-09-19T07:16:00.000Z	chuckyp	joebu23	I don't have the same card but i'm assuming what happened is whatever module you where using for that card didn't get installed with the new kernel.
2006-09-19T07:16:00.000Z	chuckyp	joebu23	if it uses restricted modules you would have to install them.
2006-09-19T07:16:00.000Z	joebu23	chuckyp	any ideas how to fix?  i have no network connection without that card
2006-09-19T07:17:00.000Z	chuckyp	joebu23	yeah the easy fix for right now would be to use the old kerenl just select it from grub's boot menu
2006-09-19T07:17:00.000Z	joebu23	chuckyp	thanks
2006-09-19T07:17:00.000Z	chuckyp	joebu23	untill you figure out what exactly is going on
2006-09-19T07:17:00.000Z	chuckyp	joebu23	it appears that atheros uses madwifi
2006-09-19T07:18:00.000Z	chuckyp	joebu23	did you try posting to the forums?
2006-09-19T07:18:00.000Z	chuckyp	joebu23	or searching them for that matter?
2006-09-19T07:19:00.000Z	joebu23	chuckyp	not yet, will try that if I can't get it to work, searches yielded nothing
