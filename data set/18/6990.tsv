2008-10-06T12:31:00.000Z	ndlovu		hi all. I had to kill update-manager (Ctl+Alt+Bkspace), Now it's complaining about not getting a lock. can I just delete /var/cache/apt/archives/lock ?
2008-10-06T12:32:00.000Z	jim_p	ndlovu	you killed it the wrong way. use killall next time
2008-10-06T12:32:00.000Z	ndlovu	jim_p	how do I know what the process name is?
2008-10-06T12:33:00.000Z	jim_p	ndlovu	you just says it was update-manager!
2008-10-06T12:33:00.000Z	ndlovu	jim_p	the only program I could find with update in it was update-notifier, and I wasn't sure it was the same thing
2008-10-06T12:34:00.000Z	jim_p	ndlovu	kill it!
2008-10-06T12:34:00.000Z	ndlovu	jim_p	next time I'll do that :) right now I'm stuck with a lock - can I just delete the lock file?
2008-10-06T12:35:00.000Z	jim_p	ndlovu	sudo rm /var/cache/apt/archives/lock and cross your fingers
2008-10-06T12:36:00.000Z	ndlovu	jim_p	I was hoping for more confidence in the procedure ;), but thanks for your help. so far nothing broken...
2008-10-06T12:37:00.000Z	jim_p	ndlovu	do a sudo apt-get update
2008-10-06T12:37:00.000Z	jim_p	ndlovu	and check for errors
2008-10-06T12:37:00.000Z	ndlovu	jim_p	apt-get update and apt-get upgrade worked okay
2008-10-06T12:38:00.000Z	jim_p	ndlovu	then you are good to go
2009-02-06T13:06:00.000Z	jim_p	ndlovu	quanta if you dont mind kde apps
2009-02-06T13:06:00.000Z	ndlovu	jim_p	isn't komposer also kde?
2009-02-06T13:07:00.000Z	jim_p	ndlovu	oddly no. kompozer is gtk
2009-02-06T13:09:00.000Z	ndlovu	jim_p	that is weird, goes against the general naming convention...
2009-02-06T13:10:00.000Z	jim_p	ndlovu	i know. the relevant kde app is quanta
