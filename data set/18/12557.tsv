2006-04-04T09:22:00.000Z	Yggdrassil	Rdde	lemme see (I'm not an ubuntu specialist)
2006-04-04T09:23:00.000Z	Yggdrassil	Rdde	system / administration / services (and see if telnet server is running)

2006-04-04T09:27:00.000Z	Yggdrassil	Rdde	I would say you might have to add the telnet deamon then... I would not be able to tell you how to do this. I just started evaluation ubuntu (which is debian based).. my main experience is with redhat which is rpm based when it comes to installing additional components.
2006-04-04T09:28:00.000Z	Rdde	Yggdrassil	 ok =) thanks for the help
2006-04-04T09:28:00.000Z	Yggdrassil	Rdde	at least you have an idea what to look for
2006-04-04T09:28:00.000Z	Rdde		how can i connect to an ubuntu using telnet?
2006-04-04T09:29:00.000Z	Yggdrassil	Rdde	maybe you could snoop around in the add applications panel? (just an idea)
