2005-06-26T08:00:00.000Z	ompaul	JloR	before you try to start the next session do this click on session and choose gnome over default, if that does not fix it then you may need to take some other action, have you added some software or removed some that you know of?
2005-06-26T08:01:00.000Z	JloR	ompaul	I haven't removed any - but I have added a few things (games / programs / java / drivers / etc. -- and upgraded what was on it of course)
2005-06-26T08:02:00.000Z	ompaul	JloR	okay well try what I suggested first if that fails I would try 'apt-get install ubuntu-desktop' in a terminal
2005-06-26T08:05:00.000Z	ompaul	JloR	next up apt-get install ubuntu-desktop
2005-06-26T08:06:00.000Z	ompaul	JloR	okay then it has not been uninstalled :-)
2005-06-26T08:07:00.000Z	ompaul	JloR	ohh hang on a sec
2005-06-26T08:08:00.000Z	ompaul	JloR	something funny in the back of my mind - do this - ls -al ~gkxjmrep/.I*
2005-06-26T08:08:00.000Z	ompaul	JloR	who owns that file?
2005-06-26T08:09:00.000Z	ompaul	JloR	it should be your local user
2005-06-26T08:09:00.000Z	ompaul	JloR	okay
2006-02-20T17:52:00.000Z	ompaul	JloR	were you moving from breezy to daooer
2006-02-20T17:53:00.000Z	ompaul	JloR	were you moving from breezy to dapper
2006-02-20T17:53:00.000Z	JloR	ompaul	yea
2006-02-20T17:53:00.000Z	JloR	ompaul	and?
2006-02-20T17:55:00.000Z	ompaul	JloR	well if you knew why the gasp ? ;-)
2006-02-20T06:00:00.000Z	ompaul	JloR	it is unstable - that means it is not ready, it scares me when I see people typing dapper in the channel, so I hit that thing, I do a lot of hours on irc and I wish dist upgrade came with a big warning for unstable, that is one of two good ideas I have had today, must register them on the wiki or launchpad or somewhere
2006-02-20T06:01:00.000Z	JloR	ompaul	still not a very polite way of letting someone know something they might know already. Just because you hear a gasp or a sigh or something , doesn't mean that people start whining and blaming everyone but themselves.
2006-02-20T06:02:00.000Z	JloR	ompaul	I've been using some form of linux for roughly 7 years now - I'm currently in the middle of a computer science education, I know a fair bit about linux and I am perfectly aware of what "beta" or "unstable" implies in connection to software.. Yet, I gasp when something freezes up my linux box so bad that I have to hard-reboot it... That doesn't make me a linux newbie or a pain in the butt to you and the others in here..
