2010-02-05T17:35:00.000Z	prodigel		hi all. who had the bright idea to change xterm colors in 9.10 :( now I don't know how to set them back to black background and white text
2010-02-05T17:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	prodigel	 xterm -rv   perhaps.  or xterm -bg black -fg white
2010-02-05T17:36:00.000Z	prodigel	Dr_Willis	is there a settings file that I can fill with this values?
2010-02-05T17:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	prodigel	 yes xterm uses the .Xdefaults file  check  google for examples  old-skool stuff there.  theres dozens of other terminals you could be using
2010-02-05T17:39:00.000Z	prodigel	Dr_Willis	xterm is the best
2010-02-05T17:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	prodigel	 No it is not.
2010-02-05T17:39:00.000Z	prodigel	Dr_Willis	tell me which is better, and why :)
2010-02-05T17:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	prodigel	 rxvt = less ram and system resources.. identical feature set.
2010-02-05T17:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	prodigel	 and proberly a dozen others taht have identical feature set and less resources
2010-02-05T17:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	prodigel	 personally these days i use 'terminator'
2010-02-05T17:41:00.000Z	prodigel	Dr_Willis	I like xterm because is universally available, and pretty cheap on resources. But if you say rxvt is even cheaper, i'll give it a try ;)
2010-02-05T17:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	prodigel	 xterm has a lot of 'features' that no one uses any more. I even forget what they were - textronics support or somthing like that
2010-02-05T17:44:00.000Z	prodigel	Dr_Willis	same Xdefaults for rxvt also?
2010-02-05T17:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	prodigel	 check google for Xdefaults examples and editing. rxvt basically works the same way.  Theres other newer terminal emulators taht proberly are just as light these days.
2010-02-05T17:45:00.000Z	prodigel	Dr_Willis	will do. thanks for your answers
2010-08-20T17:24:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	prodigel	 Hmm.. cant say that ive ever seen that done.   Its possible theres 2 or more /dev/input devices. one for each keyboard. you cold perhaps configure X to use One of them
2010-08-20T17:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	prodigel	 ive seen some sites that have 'how to disable a laptop..' tutorials/videos. :)
2010-08-20T17:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	prodigel	 i mean dissasemble.
