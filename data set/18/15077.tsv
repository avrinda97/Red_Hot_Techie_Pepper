2006-01-14T07:12:00.000Z	JarG0n		ah ok
2006-01-14T07:12:00.000Z	JarG0n		I have to hit alt-ctrl+2 to get to something I can see.  The first one is blank.  How to I get to Gnome ?

2006-01-14T07:14:00.000Z	JarG0n		sethk> it doesn't seem to do anything.  It freezes.
2006-01-14T07:14:00.000Z	JarG0n		seth> it displays the last terminal screen chosen, but the cursor stops blinking.
2006-01-14T07:15:00.000Z	JarG0n		ctrl+alt+f1 to ctrl+alt+f7 shows the first terminal

2006-01-14T07:16:00.000Z	JarG0n		how do I get to gnome?  I've only seen it on the Live CD.
2006-01-14T07:16:00.000Z	jamie	JarG0n	did you use ubuntu or kubuntu, it should load automatically in ubuntu
2006-01-14T07:17:00.000Z	jamie	JarG0n	what is loading KDE?
2006-01-14T07:18:00.000Z	jamie	JarG0n	what are you in? terminal? because Gnome is standard
2006-01-14T07:19:00.000Z	jamie	JarG0n	type gdm does it work?
2006-01-14T07:21:00.000Z	jamie	JarG0n	then try gdm again
2006-01-14T07:22:00.000Z	jamie	JarG0n	iKernel is right killall -9 gdm
2006-01-14T07:23:00.000Z	jamie	JarG0n	do what iKernel says
