2008-07-10T14:39:00.000Z	DistroJockey	kamaly	what command?
2008-07-10T14:40:00.000Z	DistroJockey	kamaly	that is not a command
2008-07-10T14:41:00.000Z	DistroJockey	kamaly	maybe you need to  sudo  that. I don't now as I have not read the readme though
2008-07-10T14:48:00.000Z	DistroJockey	kamaly	"Falcon is a tool that generates the repository meta-information" Is that the thing and did you get it via apt-get or Synaptic?
2008-07-10T14:51:00.000Z	DistroJockey	kamaly	did you change your   /etc/hosts   file by chance?
2008-07-10T16:22:00.000Z	DistroJockey	kamaly	good to hear :)
2008-07-10T16:26:00.000Z	DistroJockey	kamaly	I'm not having an issue with it as I am not installing it
2008-07-10T16:28:00.000Z	DistroJockey	kamaly	thanks for that. I'm really not familiar with falcon at all though. Glad you got it sorted
2008-07-10T16:29:00.000Z	DistroJockey	kamaly	cheers :)
