2009-11-12T00:30:00.000Z	detrate_		has anyone had a problem when booting the 9.10 CD that they drop to a command line that does nothing for a while... then the ubuntu logo comes up... then the screen just turns black?
2009-11-12T00:30:00.000Z	Scunizi	detrate_	is this after the initial menu and hitting "Try ubuntu without changes" ??
2009-11-12T00:30:00.000Z	detrate_	Scunizi	either way
2009-11-12T00:31:00.000Z	Scunizi	detrate_	so you never get the initial menu?
2009-11-12T00:32:00.000Z	Scunizi	detrate_	ok.. at that menu hit F6 and in the kernel line before quiet splash .. enter pci=nomsi and hit enter.. see if that works.
2009-11-12T00:34:00.000Z	Scunizi	detrate_	there isn't one.. you have to type it in.
2009-11-12T00:35:00.000Z	Scunizi	detrate_	use my nick.. otherwise you get lost in the noise..
2009-11-12T00:36:00.000Z	Scunizi	detrate_	at the beginning of the line so it will highlight.. first few characters and then hit TAB for autocompletion
2009-11-12T00:37:00.000Z	detrate_	Scunizi	it seems to be freezing at the same spot
2009-11-12T00:38:00.000Z	Scunizi	detrate_	ok.. the live cd does take quite a while to come up with a screen.. patience and let it run.. last time I booted the live cd it took 3 minutes
2009-11-12T00:39:00.000Z	Scunizi	detrate_	you might need to put pci=noacpi in the kernel line instead..
2009-11-12T00:41:00.000Z	detrate_	Scunizi	it just dropped me to the console again
2009-11-12T00:41:00.000Z	Scunizi	detrate_	try the pci=noacpi mod
2009-11-12T00:48:00.000Z	detrate_	Scunizi	it dropped me to $ again
2009-11-12T00:48:00.000Z	Scunizi	detrate_	could be an issue with the cd.. did you do a md5 check on it? burn it at the slowest speed?
2009-11-12T00:49:00.000Z	Scunizi	detrate_	unfortunately I've run out of ideas.. sorry
2009-11-12T00:50:00.000Z	Scunizi	detrate_	that'll work!
2009-11-12T00:51:00.000Z	Scunizi	detrate_	I know.. I haven't made the jump yet.. in here you get to see all the problems.. but really there are tons of successful installs/upgrades
