2008-04-11T08:55:00.000Z	Alan_M	sam827	did you check the ISO before burning? Is the md5 checksum right?
2008-04-11T08:57:00.000Z	Alan_M	sam827	is there any chance that I could get you to try burning it again and maybe doing a md5 check on the ISO before burning it to a cd?
2008-04-11T08:57:00.000Z	Alan_M	sam827	and if the md5 is wrong, just re-download the iso image and check it again.
