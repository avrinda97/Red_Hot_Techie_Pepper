2011-08-20T04:34:00.000Z	induz		is there any s/w application to write batch files that read one after one
2011-08-20T04:35:00.000Z	induz		I want to run 2-3 batch files but i want to select them at different orders
2011-08-20T04:35:00.000Z	induz		is it possible in ubuntu
2011-08-20T04:36:00.000Z	induz		NetBeans can do it??
2011-08-20T04:36:00.000Z	hylian	induz	i am having a hard time understanding exactly what you are referring to, you want them to go off one at a time, at a certain time, i.e. 3pm?
2011-08-20T04:37:00.000Z	induz	hylian	not at scheduled time...but in different orders
2011-08-20T04:38:00.000Z	hylian	induz	just one after another, or after a certain command or operation in the batch file has completed?
2011-08-20T04:38:00.000Z	induz	hylian	the second option...
2011-08-20T04:39:00.000Z	hylian	induz	i don;t know off hand, but let me take a crack at it.
2011-08-20T04:39:00.000Z	induz	hylian	pl
2011-08-20T04:39:00.000Z	hylian	induz	i'm gonna see if i can find info on google
2011-08-20T04:41:00.000Z	induz	hylian	 batchcomander is there but...but i am looing for something better
2011-08-20T04:43:00.000Z	hylian	induz	well, i'll do a little more research.
2011-08-20T04:43:00.000Z	induz	hylian	thanks
2011-08-20T04:44:00.000Z	hylian	induz	there is a call procedure for batch commands that might do the tricl, here's the website for it: http://www.robvanderwoude.com/call.php
2011-08-20T04:45:00.000Z	hylian	induz	i goofed up, that's for ms windows batch files, i yiy yiy.
2011-08-20T04:48:00.000Z	hylian	induz	this gives some help in bash batch calling. you would have to build a master batch file to control the others, here's where i get my info: http://nixcraft.com/shell-scripting/564-call-function-bash.html
2011-08-20T04:48:00.000Z	hylian	induz	then the proper way to call another bash script would be like this: /bin/bash /home/mylnx/script_a
