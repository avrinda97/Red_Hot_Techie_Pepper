2011-11-20T16:40:00.000Z	EuroNerd		How can I set the top panel (menubar) to be transparent?  (compiz config is not an option - doesn't work with unity)
2011-11-20T16:41:00.000Z	Stanley00	EuroNerd	in ubuntu 11.10?
2011-11-20T16:42:00.000Z	EuroNerd	Stanley00	yes.
2011-11-20T16:43:00.000Z	Stanley00	EuroNerd	are you sure the compiz config not work? It works in my case.
2011-11-20T16:44:00.000Z	EuroNerd	Stanley00	I just installed it and tried to change sth and it completely f#cked up my desktop. Had to spend 20min searching for a solution on the web to restore it.
2011-11-20T16:45:00.000Z	Stanley00	EuroNerd	it there, in the unity plugin config, the experience tab, panel opacity
2011-11-20T16:45:00.000Z	EuroNerd	Stanley00	as I just said, CompizConfig is dangerous and I uninstalled it and will never touch it again, until it's fixed thoroughly to work with Unity.
2011-11-20T16:46:00.000Z	Stanley00	EuroNerd	compiz config works as a charm on my laptop, as long as you dont mess up so much :D
2011-11-20T16:49:00.000Z	Stanley00	EuroNerd	the command way is dangerous too, it just depends on who is using it...
2011-11-20T16:51:00.000Z	EuroNerd	Stanley00	yes, you can do the equivalent of "format c:\" in command line, but that's proactive danger.
2011-11-20T16:52:00.000Z	EuroNerd	Stanley00	dr_willis, actually all I did in CompizConfig was go to the "About" section to see the version number. And it completely messed up my Compiz and Unity. Here's a testimony of what happens: http://askubuntu.com/questions/70866/how-to-reset-compiz-unity-to-defaults
2011-11-20T16:54:00.000Z	Stanley00	EuroNerd	AFAIK, compiz config is the easiest tool to config unity, as long as you dont set up any other plugins
2011-11-20T16:55:00.000Z	EuroNerd	Stanley00	I was using the default installation and didn't really have the chance to go to any plugin config. It's just very buggy and dangerous with Unity.
2011-11-20T16:56:00.000Z	Stanley00	EuroNerd	then, maybe you should install gconf-editor tool, this tool is very dagerous too, but I prefer it to the gconftool command
2011-11-20T16:57:00.000Z	Stanley00	EuroNerd	I think the key you should change is at /apps/compiz-1/plugins/unityshell/screen0/options/panel_opacity
2011-11-20T16:57:00.000Z	EuroNerd	Stanley00	I have gconf-editor, use it and it never ever failed me.
2011-11-20T16:58:00.000Z	EuroNerd	Stanley00	thank you! That is precisely what I needed!  :) :) :)
2011-11-20T16:59:00.000Z	Stanley00	EuroNerd	you are welcome :)
