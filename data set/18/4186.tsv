2009-05-22T01:58:00.000Z	Dulak	myxo	a geek would never threaten to do it first, they'd just do it

2009-05-22T02:34:00.000Z	myxo	Dulak	yes
2009-05-22T02:42:00.000Z	Dulak	myxo	it's probably best for you to stick with software from the repositories till you get a little more comfortable in linux
2009-05-22T02:43:00.000Z	myxo	Dulak	but its so tempting =) i love playing hehe
2009-05-22T02:43:00.000Z	Dulak	myxo	I know, I'm that way too, just saying...  use repos if at all possible
2009-05-22T02:44:00.000Z	Dulak	myxo	anytime you find a program you want to try, go to synaptic and search for it there
2009-05-22T02:45:00.000Z	Dulak	myxo	enable the universe and multiverse repos too, they have a LOT of packages not included by default
2009-05-22T02:46:00.000Z	myxo	Dulak	boss_mc Slart gordonjcp Flannel thank you for your comments and sorry for my inability to keep up, I dive into things and get in over my head x,x I'll catch up though!
