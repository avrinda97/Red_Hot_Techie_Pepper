2006-08-08T05:20:00.000Z	mwe		I don't know how kdm could even slip into stable in it's current state
2006-08-08T05:20:00.000Z	kOpter	mwe	> It's working perfectly here...
2006-08-08T05:21:00.000Z	mwe	kOpter	good for you. many people are having problems with it though
2006-08-08T05:21:00.000Z	kOpter	mwe	> 3.5.4?
2006-08-08T05:21:00.000Z	mwe	kOpter	go to launchpad.net and search for kdm and you'll see
2006-08-08T05:22:00.000Z	mwe	kOpter	the ubuntu default version as well as the updated one from kubuntu.org
2006-08-08T05:22:00.000Z	mwe	kOpter	KDE itself is ok though
2006-08-08T05:23:00.000Z	kOpter	mwe	> Ok..
2006-08-08T05:23:00.000Z	mwe	kOpter	does sudo /etc/init.d/kdm restart work properly for you?
2006-08-08T05:23:00.000Z	kOpter	mwe	> I'm at gdm at the moment :) Trying to get kompiz to work :)
2006-08-08T05:23:00.000Z	mwe		oh
2006-08-08T05:24:00.000Z	mwe	kOpter	good luck 
2006-08-08T05:25:00.000Z	kOpter	mwe	> It's working perfectly :)
2006-08-08T05:26:00.000Z	mwe	kOpter	good. I still wouldn't call it stable with all those bug reports though
2006-08-08T05:26:00.000Z	kOpter		mwe> I don't start it on boot :)
2006-08-08T05:27:00.000Z	mwe	kOpter	personally I don't think "it works for 90%" is good enough
2006-08-08T05:27:00.000Z	kOpter	mwe	> I like playing with it :)
2006-08-08T05:27:00.000Z	mwe	kOpter	I guess you can hear I'm kinda angry with it
