2006-03-05T17:52:00.000Z	sovin		urgent!: my wifi nic works when i'm at home in my own lan, but when i boot up at say, the cybercafe i'm in right now -- my laptop doesn't even see the card
2006-03-05T17:52:00.000Z	sovin		can anyone help me fix it?
2006-03-05T17:53:00.000Z	njan	sovin	what's different about your setup at home to in the cafe, apart from the fact that it's plugged in somewhere else, and are you positive the card isn't seen?
2006-03-05T17:53:00.000Z	sovin		kakipukul: it is not detected by the computer.
2006-03-05T17:54:00.000Z	sovin	njan	network-admin > ifconfig doesn't show my wireless nic
2006-03-05T17:54:00.000Z	sovin		while at home it does.
2006-03-05T17:54:00.000Z	sovin		kakipukul: it is a laptop.
2006-03-05T17:55:00.000Z	njan	sovin	what's the output of "ifconfig -a |grep Ethernet" (stick it on pastebin.com)
2006-03-05T17:56:00.000Z	sovin	njan	i recieve eth0  Link encap: ethernet Hwaddr: my mac address
2006-03-05T17:56:00.000Z	njan	sovin	nothing apart from eth0?
2006-03-05T17:56:00.000Z	sovin		*njan: that is my integrated ethernet nic though (i'm currently wired into the router directly).. it doesn't list anything besides eth0, no
2006-03-05T17:57:00.000Z	njan	sovin	what happens if you unplug and replug the wireless card?
2006-03-05T17:58:00.000Z	sovin	njan	the card lights up appropriately, but the laptop doesn't detect it
2006-03-05T17:58:00.000Z	njan	sovin	anything new if you dmesg |tail?
2006-03-05T17:58:00.000Z	sovin		*njan: if i go into 'device manager' it does show up as an unknown device under the pcicardbus
2006-03-05T17:58:00.000Z	sovin	njan	hold on
2006-03-05T17:58:00.000Z	njan		(or dmesg |tail -n 40)
2006-03-05T17:59:00.000Z	sovin	njan	nope
