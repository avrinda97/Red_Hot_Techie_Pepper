2007-06-23T08:59:00.000Z	george_looney		I have a nasty package that is stuck
2007-06-23T08:59:00.000Z	george_looney		how do I get rid of it?
2007-06-23T08:59:00.000Z	Ireal	george_looney	is it on strike? or did it lose consciousness?
2007-06-23T09:00:00.000Z	george_looney	Ireal	its broken and stuck in my throat ;)
2007-06-23T09:06:00.000Z	Ireal	george_looney	you could try to force the package :)
2007-06-23T09:06:00.000Z	george_looney	Ireal	like using the "-f" option?
2007-06-23T09:06:00.000Z	Ireal	george_looney	dpkg -i --force-all yourpackage.deb something along those lines :)
2007-06-23T09:06:00.000Z	george_looney	Ireal	ok lemm try that
2007-06-23T09:07:00.000Z	george_looney	Ireal	Does it work with remove as well?
2007-06-23T09:07:00.000Z	Ireal	george_looney	dunno, but if you've installed it, you can always remove it normally :)
2007-06-23T09:08:00.000Z	george_looney	Ireal	thats the problem
2007-06-23T09:08:00.000Z	Ireal	george_looney	i suppose -e is delete, lemme check
2007-06-23T09:08:00.000Z	george_looney	Ireal	"-r"
2007-06-23T09:09:00.000Z	Ireal	george_looney	ah yes
2007-06-23T09:10:00.000Z	george_looney	Ireal	no problem...it is just a package that has not been tested properly
2007-06-23T09:10:00.000Z	george_looney	Ireal	I believe it is from Multiverse
2007-06-23T09:10:00.000Z	george_looney	Ireal	So I asked for it :)
