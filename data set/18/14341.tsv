2006-08-03T06:30:00.000Z	drayen		HELP :) I have an older laptop with no network. i installed 5.10 on it via cd and im now trying to upgrade useing the dapper cd - but its not working. i've added the cd via synaptic (and even disabled the other sources), but when i "apt-get update, apt-get upgrade" it doenst upgrade - help !!!
2006-08-03T06:31:00.000Z	Chousuke	drayen	do aptitude dist-upgrade
2006-08-03T06:34:00.000Z	drayen	Chousuke	nope, it just skips 2 packages (cpp and cpp-4.0) and does nothing. im not sure its taken the CD properly (the laptop im trying to upgrade isnt connected to the net)
2006-08-03T06:37:00.000Z	Chousuke	drayen	hm.
2006-08-03T06:38:00.000Z	drayen	Chousuke	yeah its got me as well
2006-08-03T06:38:00.000Z	drayen	Chousuke	like i said, i think its not loading the stuff from the cd properly
2006-08-03T06:40:00.000Z	drayen	Chousuke	can you paste your sources.list line for the CD? as i think that could be the problem
2006-08-03T06:41:00.000Z	Chousuke	drayen	I don't have it.
2006-08-03T06:41:00.000Z	drayen	Chousuke	:(
2006-08-03T06:41:00.000Z	Chousuke	drayen	but you should be able to add a cd with apt-setup. :/
2006-08-03T06:41:00.000Z	drayen		i cant work out why this isnt working
2006-08-03T06:42:00.000Z	drayen	Chousuke	will try that now
2006-08-03T06:42:00.000Z	Chousuke	drayen	not sure though.
2006-08-03T06:44:00.000Z	drayen	Chousuke	well i used apt-cdrom -a add
2006-08-03T06:44:00.000Z	drayen	Chousuke	which worked fine
2006-08-03T06:44:00.000Z	drayen	Chousuke	but then apt-get update -> apt-get upgrade -> apt-get dist-upgrade
2006-08-03T06:44:00.000Z	drayen	Chousuke	all still did nothing >;(
2006-08-03T07:15:00.000Z	drayen	Chousuke	bugger - looks like you need the alternative cdrom to do an upgrade from an exsisting install :(
