2010-03-27T14:36:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	ravibn	BIOS limitation or bad image creation.
2010-03-27T14:36:00.000Z	ravibn	LinuxGuy2009	: I went into the BIOS setup and changed it to boot from USB
2010-03-27T14:38:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	ravibn	Then unetbootin didnt make the image correctly or the drive might not have been properly unmounted first?
2010-03-27T14:39:00.000Z	ravibn	LinuxGuy2009	: What do I do to verify the installation ?
2010-03-27T14:39:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	ravibn	If it dont boot it aint no good. Thats how you check it.
2010-03-27T14:40:00.000Z	ravibn	LinuxGuy2009	: so you ask me to reinstall and then try ?
2010-03-27T14:40:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	ravibn	Thats up to you.
2010-03-27T14:41:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	ravibn	md5sum the ISO and then reformat the drive to fat32 and try again.
2010-03-27T14:42:00.000Z	ravibn	LinuxGuy2009	:  I will do that Pl. tell me how to remove this grub entry When ever I install there is an entry made into Grub
2010-03-27T14:43:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	ravibn	Grub where? On the unetbootin device?
2010-03-27T14:44:00.000Z	ravibn	LinuxGuy2009	: Grub  is on my HDrive
2010-03-27T14:44:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	ravibn	You can edit it sure as long as you know what your doing. Google has step by step guides for you.
