2006-03-09T14:18:00.000Z	quad_		Problem: CUPS somehow got disabled when I ran apt-get dist-upgrade. Any ideas how I might get it back?? - I have tried apt-get installing it, but then it tells me, that it depends of some xpdf package, which then depends of 3 other packages...
2006-03-09T14:18:00.000Z	ompaul	quad_	are you running dapper?
2006-03-09T14:18:00.000Z	quad_	ompaul	no hoary
2006-03-09T14:18:00.000Z	ompaul	quad_	what are you trying to upgrade to?
2006-03-09T14:19:00.000Z	quad_	ompaul	Nothing actually, just did it to see if it would help my performance in certain applications.
2006-03-09T14:20:00.000Z	quad_	ompaul	it DL'ed some 40 Megs, and during packageinstallation the CUPS service was disabled.
2006-03-09T14:22:00.000Z	ompaul	quad_	dist-upgrade works version to version it does not impact within a single version, if you have downloaded a new kernel please reboot then click on system administration and printing and it should help, however you may wish to come forward to the next updated version which was relased in October, that is 5.10 for that you must upgrade, it was a big improvement unless of course you have downloaded lots of packgages from outside of the distro
2006-03-09T14:23:00.000Z	quad_	ompaul	I have rebootet once or twice since. What is it the cmd for checking kernelversion is?
2006-03-09T14:24:00.000Z	ompaul	quad_	that is seperate, it is uname -r
2006-03-09T14:24:00.000Z	ompaul	quad_	okay so if you do what I suggested you should be able to reconfigure the printer
2006-03-09T14:25:00.000Z	quad_	ompaul	2.6.10-6-386 is my current version. And I have tried starting the printers-config, but it tells me that it is unable to contact CUPS.
2006-03-09T14:28:00.000Z	ompaul	quad_	I can't remember anything about 5.04, it has been at least 6 months since I ran that, if you came forward to 5.10 I know you would get a lot more help, is there a reason for staying on that version?
2006-03-09T14:30:00.000Z	quad_	ompaul	no none what so ever, but if I got a new kernel, would that help my CUPS system?
2006-03-09T14:30:00.000Z	ompaul	quad_	it should
2006-03-09T14:31:00.000Z	ompaul	quad_	only look at the "breezy" url I dapper is in development
2006-03-09T14:46:00.000Z	quad_	ompaul	wow that repo-change and dist-upgrade is getting some 400 megs :) - im getting a brand new system :P
2006-03-09T14:47:00.000Z	ompaul	quad_	assuming your male sorry
2006-03-09T14:50:00.000Z	ompaul	quad_	no your doing 5.10 which is breezy I want you with a working system not one that is being developed and may crash and burn at a moments notice
