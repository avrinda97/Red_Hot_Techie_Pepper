2006-03-26T10:19:00.000Z	tritium	Crshman	no reformatting.  Simply dist-upgrading.  Don't worry, instructions will be provided.
2006-03-26T11:03:00.000Z	tritium	Crshman	is toshiba_acpi module loaded?
2006-03-26T11:05:00.000Z	tritium	Crshman	lsmod | grep acpi
2006-03-26T11:05:00.000Z	tritium	Crshman	also, look for acpi_sbs
2006-03-26T11:06:00.000Z	tritium	Crshman	no toshiba_acpi?  You need to modprobe it, and add it to your /etc/modules
2006-03-26T11:07:00.000Z	Crshman	tritium	comes back with "no such device"
2006-03-26T11:07:00.000Z	tritium	Crshman	really?  hmm...
2006-03-26T11:08:00.000Z	Crshman	tritium	just installed some updates, lets see if it'll come up on restart
2006-03-26T11:08:00.000Z	tritium	Crshman	you're on breezy, or dapper?
2006-03-26T11:08:00.000Z	Crshman	tritium	breezy
2006-03-26T11:09:00.000Z	tritium	Crshman	okay
2006-03-26T11:19:00.000Z	tritium	Crshman	easyubuntu is preferred
2006-03-26T11:20:00.000Z	Crshman	tritium	i know, but automatix has more packages haha
2006-03-26T11:21:00.000Z	tritium	Crshman	well, please don't recommend it here, okay?  It can mess up your system.
