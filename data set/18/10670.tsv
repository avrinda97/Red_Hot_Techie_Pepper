2010-07-12T13:27:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ross_	Xchat is just one of many IRC clients: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat
2010-07-15T04:43:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ross_	What did you actually do?
2010-07-15T04:47:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ross_	You'll most likely need a LiveCD/USB/ rescue floppy.
2010-07-15T04:48:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ross_	If it's a recent enough version to support ext4, yes.
2010-07-15T04:49:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ross_	Yes.
2010-07-15T04:57:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ross_	Yes.
2010-07-15T04:58:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ross_	First run boot info script as explained here and pastebin the output: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1291280
2010-07-15T05:01:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ross_	What do you mean "no such file or downloads"?
2010-07-15T05:01:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ross_	That's what what "says"?
2010-07-15T05:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ross_	After running what command?
2010-07-15T05:03:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ross_	The terminal is case sensitive, that's "Downloads" not "downloads".
2010-07-15T05:03:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ross_	What is the exact command you ran?
2010-07-15T05:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ross_	Did you download the script?
2010-07-15T05:06:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ross_	Follow the directions non that page, don't skip over anything.
2010-07-15T05:18:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ross_	It looks like you tried to re-install grub without following all of the steps, follow this guide *exactly*, asking questions if there is anthing you don't understand, and you should be fine: http://grub.enbug.org/Grub2LiveCdInstallGuide
2010-07-15T05:20:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ross_	Just follow that guide and everything will work.
2010-07-15T05:32:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ross_	You're welcome.
