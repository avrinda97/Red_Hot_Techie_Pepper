2008-12-14T21:20:00.000Z	lordblaa		hey guys - this is a pretty weird problem - not even sure if its linux-related but hoping someone has seen it before - i have 3 external usb disks, when i boot with any of them plugged in, i get all kinds of buffer errors on -one- of them and its unreadable until i unplug and replug it.. happens in win and lin.. mobo? usb controller? bios? etc? any ideas?
2008-12-14T21:22:00.000Z	hololight	lordblaa	I have had that problem before.... I think it turned out to be a bad USB controller
2008-12-14T21:22:00.000Z	lordblaa	hololight	- hardware fault?
2008-12-14T21:22:00.000Z	hololight	lordblaa	aye
2008-12-14T21:23:00.000Z	lordblaa	hololight	not too hot on my hardware - is a usb controller built into the mobo or...?
2008-12-14T21:23:00.000Z	hololight	lordblaa	depends... but almost always these days
2008-12-14T21:24:00.000Z	lordblaa	hololight	oh dear - so i need a new motherboard?
2008-12-14T21:24:00.000Z	hololight	lordblaa	have you you tried a different drive?
2008-12-14T21:24:00.000Z	hololight	lordblaa	know your way around a bios menu?
2008-12-14T21:24:00.000Z	lordblaa	hololight	sure
2008-12-14T21:25:00.000Z	hololight	lordblaa	hrmm
2008-12-14T21:25:00.000Z	hololight	lordblaa	warranty?
2008-12-14T21:26:00.000Z	hololight	lordblaa	but in this case you would have an argument, nothing you could have done could cause this problem.....
2008-12-14T21:27:00.000Z	hololight	lordblaa	did you try a different combination of which drives were plugged into which ports? most mobo's use two different 'internal hubs'.... so certain ports are on one, and the rest on the other....
2008-12-14T21:28:00.000Z	lordblaa	hololight	that sounds good - i'm up for trying anything that might work - so swap the plugs to different sockets?
2008-12-14T21:28:00.000Z	hololight	lordblaa	yeah
2008-12-14T21:29:00.000Z	hololight	lordblaa	if the only thing was a tie, you can pick those up from like a walmart for a couple bucks
2008-12-14T21:59:00.000Z	lordblaa	hololight	recon69 - plugged them into the ports on the front of the case.. seem to work now *sigh*.  must be some sort of hw bug i think.. but i guess i can live with it this way.  thanks for the help guys would never have worked it out otherwise
