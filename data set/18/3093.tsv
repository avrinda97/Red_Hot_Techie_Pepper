2009-12-20T19:18:00.000Z	M1TE5H		in ubuntu 9.04 how normal user can shutdown or hat system in text base (virtual console)
2009-12-20T19:18:00.000Z	M1TE5H		that user does not have sudo access
2009-12-20T19:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	M1TE5H	 one 'nasty' way is to  set the suid bit on the shutdown/halt/reboot commands
2009-12-20T19:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	M1TE5H	 its best to let them use sudo. :)  You can set where no password is needed for sudo for specific commands.
2009-12-20T19:20:00.000Z	M1TE5H	Dr_Willis	ikonia: yaa but without adding that user in sudoer that user can able halt system through graphical login
2009-12-20T19:20:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	M1TE5H	 thats beceuse 'gdm' has the proper permissions to do so.
2009-12-20T19:21:00.000Z	M1TE5H	Dr_Willis	ikonia: so in text base  without adding or setting subit its not possible
2009-12-20T19:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	M1TE5H	 if you want them to use the halt/shutdown/whatever commands  they need to be in the proper group for those commands. You dont want someone just sshing in and halting the box
2009-12-20T19:23:00.000Z	M1TE5H	Dr_Willis	ikonia : hello actually I have no permission of the system for adding my username in /etc/sudoers or changing permission of hat or shutdown commans so when I want to shutdown system I always going 4 graphical then shutdown the my system that's the problem
2009-12-20T19:24:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	M1TE5H	 if you dont have the permissions.. then whos pc is it? and why are you shutting it down>
2009-12-20T19:24:00.000Z	M1TE5H	Dr_Willis	ikonia : if you know any possible way to avoid those things (change to graphical login ) please tell me
2009-12-20T19:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	M1TE5H	 i just set the suid bit on shutdown so my users (all 3 of us) can shutdown via the command line.
2009-12-20T19:27:00.000Z	M1TE5H	Dr_Willis	ikonia : I am root of my system but still I want to do without change any file or permission
2009-12-20T19:27:00.000Z	M1TE5H	Dr_Willis	ikonia : how graphical ver can do I just try same through command line
2009-12-20T19:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	M1TE5H	 time to hit google  i guess. You could just hit the power button.  I dont see whats teh big deal about 'changeing' files or permissions
2009-12-20T19:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	M1TE5H	 gdm is  a service - it has its own special set of permissions like all services do
2009-12-20T19:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	M1TE5H	 same way the web server has access to the http dir. and  so on.
2009-12-27T19:25:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	M1TE5H	 gdm has settings to auto liogin as a specific  user check the system-> admin -> liogin windoqw tool
