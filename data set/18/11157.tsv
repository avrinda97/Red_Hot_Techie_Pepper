2007-07-20T07:17:00.000Z	obf213		its opened. i guess the command to open it is not its name.
2007-07-20T07:18:00.000Z	nickrud	obf213	a quick way to find what command(s) to run from a package is:  dpkg -L <packagename> | grep bin
2007-07-20T08:35:00.000Z	nickrud	obf213	applications aren't kept in a single directory like windows; in general the executables are in /bin, the configurations are in /etc, libraries are in /usr/lib, volatile stuff is in /var and support/data files in /usr/share. For a particular app, dpkg -L <package> will show you where
2007-07-25T16:03:00.000Z	nickrud	obf213	apt-get remove --purge
2008-07-05T03:52:00.000Z	nickrud	obf213	try preferred applications as a preference
2008-07-05T03:53:00.000Z	obf213	nickrud	apparently in 8.04 they decided to leave out the option as to how u want to configure it i guess. i had to go to nautilus settingsk and I couldn't even but in a different command, say Floola for example
2008-07-05T03:55:00.000Z	nickrud	obf213	system->prefs->preferred applications multimedia tab
2008-07-05T03:55:00.000Z	obf213	nickrud	i dont have that tabs is what I am saying
2008-07-05T03:56:00.000Z	nickrud	obf213	you mentioned removeable drives & media, and yes it's not there, it's under preferred applications. And you are sure there's no multimedia tab there?
