2011-03-30T17:26:00.000Z	Christoper		anyone else in here on 32Gig of ram?
2011-03-30T17:26:00.000Z	Christoper		if I half the ram to 16G it Ubuntu boots and works fine, however on 32 it blackscreens and shuts down
2011-03-30T17:27:00.000Z	Christoper		NVIDIA MCP51 Chipset, quad SLI GTX 480s
2011-03-30T17:28:00.000Z	Christoper		no I didnt
2011-03-30T17:28:00.000Z	Christoper		you read wrong
2011-03-30T17:28:00.000Z	Christoper		I said Ubuntu boots in 16Gig
2011-03-30T17:28:00.000Z	Christoper		it doesnt boot in anything more than 16gig
2011-03-30T17:28:00.000Z	ohsix	Christoper	did you install the pae kernel or a 64bit version?
2011-03-30T17:30:00.000Z	ohsix	Christoper	when do you get the black screen? you can make the booting more verbose and look for panics
2011-03-30T17:31:00.000Z	Christoper	ohsix	it gets to the login screen I log in, it then goes to the desktop, I cant move my mouse, then some random numbers and letters pop up for less than a second then it shuts off
2011-03-30T17:31:00.000Z	ohsix	Christoper	ok that's something else, then
2011-03-30T17:31:00.000Z	Christoper	ohsix	works with 16gig of ram just fine
2011-03-30T17:31:00.000Z	ohsix	Christoper	but it is panicking; you just need to find out where
2011-03-30T17:34:00.000Z	ohsix	Christoper	that might sidestep the problem, but it won't fix the one you're having with the 64bit version
2011-03-30T17:38:00.000Z	ohsix	Christoper	sounds like the cpu governor stuff isn't working, or the bios tables are wrong
2011-03-30T17:39:00.000Z	Christoper	ohsix	no cuz it works fine in Windows with AMD Cool N' Quiet
2011-03-30T17:39:00.000Z	ohsix	Christoper	that doesn't have anything to do with ubuntu or linux, however
2011-03-30T17:39:00.000Z	ohsix	Christoper	linux actually attempts to do things properly and relies on the bios information to do it, vendors often don't care when windows just does its own thing and it works anyways
