2009-01-04T17:08:00.000Z	bryton_03		I was about to use camserv but when I execute camserv it gives me this : /dev/video0: Device or resource busy
2009-01-04T17:08:00.000Z	bryton_03		anything I should stop?

2009-01-04T17:09:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	bryton_03	are you sure your camera is supported
2009-01-04T17:10:00.000Z	bryton_03	Paddy_EIRE	but lately I can't open it on camorama
2009-01-04T17:10:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	bryton_03	try cheese.. I noticed that works more successfully than camorama
2009-01-04T17:12:00.000Z	bryton_03	Paddy_EIRE	can I do something to fix this: /dev/video0: Device or resource busy
2009-01-04T17:12:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	bryton_03	its probably the wrong number/name
2009-01-04T17:12:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	bryton_03	e.g. video0:
2009-01-04T17:13:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	bryton_03	replace with a one to humour me
2009-01-04T17:14:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	bryton_03	which webcam is it ?
2009-01-04T17:14:00.000Z	bryton_03	Paddy_EIRE	what do you mean replace with 1?
2009-01-04T17:14:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	bryton_03	in the camorama option
2009-01-04T17:15:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	bryton_03	e.g. change /dev/video0 to /dev/video1
2009-01-04T17:15:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	bryton_03	that has solved for some... although dont bank on it.. as I said it was to humour me :)
2009-01-04T17:17:00.000Z	bryton_03	Paddy_EIRE	a4 tech pk-635M - don't know why I keep getting that "device busy" I does not happend recently
2009-01-04T17:19:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	bryton_03	this is for kopete although should be applicable for any other app http://ubuntusite.com/how-a4tech-webcam-work-kopete/
