2009-02-09T13:18:00.000Z	Aperture_Science		Oh. Of course, I'm sorry I know about version numbers and all. Being brand new to linux is like trying to take everything I've learned about computers in the last 10 years, and throw it out. It's fun! But it's also challenging. Thanks for the tips, Scunizi.
2009-02-09T13:19:00.000Z	Aperture_Science		For right now, Tr3y- , I do what I can, because I must.
2009-02-09T13:21:00.000Z	Aperture_Science		I wish I could have someone here to hold my hand while I break my computer multiple times trying to learn everything. o.O
2009-02-09T13:22:00.000Z	Aperture_Science		Nvidia drivers, Tr3y- . SLI Nvidia drivers, specifically. When I install the package through Synaptic it for some reason makes xserver freak out and decide I don't want GNOME.
2009-02-09T13:23:00.000Z	Aperture_Science		And I'm stuck with a CLI after the install.
2009-02-09T13:25:00.000Z	syockit	Aperture_Science	first, let's restore the X setting so that it uses nv instead of nvidia
2009-02-09T13:27:00.000Z	syockit	Aperture_Science	probably. then better find out if your problem is a known one or not
2009-02-09T13:27:00.000Z	syockit	Aperture_Science	Did you install through the Restricted Drivers manager, or some other method?
2009-02-09T13:28:00.000Z	Aperture_Science	syockit	I've been bouncing around different forums. Haven't found anything specific to my issue, I installed using Synaptic.
2009-02-09T13:29:00.000Z	Aperture_Science	syockit	specifically I followed System > Administration > Hardware Drivers
2009-02-09T13:29:00.000Z	syockit	Aperture_Science	where did you look for the howto? Have you tried https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto
2009-02-09T13:31:00.000Z	syockit	Aperture_Science	yup, me thinks so too
2009-02-09T13:35:00.000Z	syockit	Aperture_Science	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=698805 might have a clue?
2009-02-09T13:36:00.000Z	Aperture_Science	syockit	thanks. I'll take a look at that.
2009-02-09T13:43:00.000Z	syockit	Aperture_Science	holy lawd
2009-02-09T13:44:00.000Z	syockit	Aperture_Science	if you insist. http://forums.nvidia.com/lofiversion/index.php?t66203.html
2009-02-09T13:47:00.000Z	syockit	Aperture_Science	no. save that for fallback
