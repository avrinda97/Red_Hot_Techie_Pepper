2009-06-22T23:03:00.000Z	asathoor		hi - my router's ap cannot be seen by linux. The router is a 802.11n draft 2.0 standard.
2009-06-22T23:03:00.000Z	cabrey	asathoor	does it see the AP's network? if so, then everything is working
2009-06-22T23:04:00.000Z	asathoor	cabrey	> it can see other ap's - but not mine. And windows can see it, so it works.,...
2009-06-22T23:05:00.000Z	cabrey	asathoor	when you say AP i'm thinking of a large wireless network is many AP's and all connect you to one network, if this the case?
2009-06-22T23:05:00.000Z	cabrey		s/Is/with
2009-06-22T23:05:00.000Z	asathoor		well I live in a house with many wifis
2009-06-22T23:05:00.000Z	asathoor		so the wireless drivers work, but why can't I see my own router's ap?
2009-06-22T23:06:00.000Z	cabrey	asathoor	ok a router and AP is not the same thing. if it's just a home wireless network it's probably just a router
2009-06-22T23:06:00.000Z	cabrey	asathoor	is the network broadcasting?
2009-06-22T23:06:00.000Z	asathoor		in the house we have some 10-13 apÃ¸s
2009-06-22T23:06:00.000Z	asathoor	cabrey	>> yes, it can be seen by (sorry) windows
2009-06-22T23:07:00.000Z	cabrey	asathoor	Windows will see if forever after it is known, if you check the router config page, make sure it is broadcasting
2009-06-22T23:07:00.000Z	cabrey		it*
2009-06-22T23:08:00.000Z	asathoor	cabrey	>> well, it is broadcasting, but linux cannot see it
2009-06-22T23:08:00.000Z	asathoor		strange
2009-06-22T23:09:00.000Z	cabrey	asathoor	how are you coming to the conclusion it is broadcasting? just saying windows see it doesn't tell me anything. windows will see it after you tell it to look for it, it's almost like bluetooth pairing
2009-06-22T23:10:00.000Z	asathoor		well, I can see the ap broadcast via windows - so linux ought to be able to do the same
2009-06-22T23:10:00.000Z	cabrey	asathoor	not if it isn't broadcasting. can you please check the router/ap config page?
