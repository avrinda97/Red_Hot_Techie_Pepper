2011-09-26T22:37:00.000Z	BetaArk		Hi! I cannot boot the Ubuntu Natty amd64 iso with UEFI.. what I'm I doing wrong? I only get a blank screen.. If I set it to BIOS the live-cd loads fine
2011-09-26T22:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	BetaArk	did you MD5 test the ISO?
2011-09-26T22:40:00.000Z	BetaArk	ActionParsnip	Yes, it is the same. Also I can boot the live-cd in normal BIOS mode, but not inside UEFI. I also tried the newest (daily) iso, but no difference, still cannot boot with UEFI :S
2011-09-26T22:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	BetaArk	what video chip do you use?
2011-09-26T22:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	BetaArk	oh jeez, no idea then
2011-09-26T22:41:00.000Z	BetaArk	ActionParsnip	Tried also with nouveau.modeset=0, but again.. just a blank 'hanging' screen :(
2011-09-26T22:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	BetaArk	possibly:  nouveau.blacklist=1   that optimus stuff is a real headache. all I can suggest is try and disable the intel so you only have nvidia running
2011-09-26T22:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	BetaArk	its the optimus thinig. I've never seen a success story with it
2011-09-26T22:44:00.000Z	BetaArk	ActionParsnip	You have right, going to try it. Thanks :)
2011-09-26T22:44:00.000Z	BetaArk	ActionParsnip	Hate optimus btw. :(....
2011-09-26T22:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	BetaArk	not to the OS, no
2011-09-26T22:50:00.000Z	BetaArk	ActionParsnip	So only in the boot time? So not while running programs, etc.? (I have a SSD)
2011-09-26T22:53:00.000Z	BetaArk	ActionParsnip	Sorry for all the questions :P Need to know this, if this is correct, I will switch to BIOS mode and use MBR. :D
2011-09-26T22:57:00.000Z	BetaArk	ActionParsnip	Oke, going to switch to MBR :D
2011-10-12T17:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	BetaArk	which release are you using?
2011-10-12T17:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	BetaArk	how did you get it, its not in the repos....
2011-10-12T17:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	BetaArk	if you installed Gnome3 via the PPA, you will get issues. You are supported in #gnome   not here
2011-10-12T17:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	BetaArk	then its not supported here
