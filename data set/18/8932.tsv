2007-06-04T13:14:00.000Z	Robert98374		yes
2007-06-04T13:14:00.000Z	Robert98374		they tried to explain how to do it
2007-06-04T13:15:00.000Z	Robert98374		but i got lost fairly quick
2007-06-04T12:42:00.000Z	Robert98374		Hello everyone
2007-06-04T12:43:00.000Z	Robert98374		My conky is disappearing right after i start up,its running in the background as per system moniter
2007-06-04T12:44:00.000Z	teamwork_	Robert98374	is that error happening with just one particular .conkyrc configuration, or all of them?
2007-06-04T12:45:00.000Z	Robert98374	teamwork_	its happening no matter which one i am using
2007-06-04T12:45:00.000Z	teamwork_	Robert98374	did you add "Load   "dbe"" in xorg.conf?
2007-06-04T12:46:00.000Z	Robert98374	teamwork_	yep
2007-06-04T12:46:00.000Z	teamwork_	Robert98374	kill conky and then run it from a terminal.  that way you'll see any error messages.
2007-06-04T12:46:00.000Z	Robert98374	teamwork_	 I close it though the system moniter and start it up manually and it works fine that way
2007-06-04T12:50:00.000Z	Robert98374	teamwork_	the only error i am getting is Conky: statfs '/media/hda1': No such file or directory
2007-06-04T12:50:00.000Z	teamwork_	Robert98374	that's because you're using someone else's configuration that doesn't exactly fit your system.  ;)
2007-06-04T12:51:00.000Z	teamwork_	Robert98374	so when it's autostarted it's buggy, but when you start it via command it's fine?
2007-06-04T12:56:00.000Z	Robert98374	teamwork_	are you going to be on later i have to go
2007-06-04T12:57:00.000Z	teamwork_	Robert98374	probably won't.
2007-06-04T12:57:00.000Z	Robert98374	teamwork_	ok ill try to find someone else than thank for the help
2007-06-04T12:57:00.000Z	teamwork_	Robert98374	ur welcome.
