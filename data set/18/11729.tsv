2006-06-19T07:01:00.000Z	kevinly		having problems mounting a windows partition.
2006-06-19T07:01:00.000Z	kevinly		i've 2 partitions that came up automatically which are fine
2006-06-19T07:01:00.000Z	kevinly		that i can't write to.
2006-06-19T07:02:00.000Z	kevinly		but i've set a side 4gb as a drive that would be mutally writeable from both
2006-06-19T07:02:00.000Z	kevinly		the format obviously didnt work
2006-06-19T07:02:00.000Z	kevinly		i formated the drive to fat32
2006-06-19T07:03:00.000Z	kevinly		but it's still not operatable from linux...
2006-06-19T07:03:00.000Z	kevinly		i just went into system/administration/disk format and expected it to work tbh
2006-06-19T07:03:00.000Z	ic56	kevinly	point your browser to http://ca.geocities.com/ic56@rogers.com/65/diskmounter-latest.txt Page down to "Instructions", and read till the next blank line.  Follow the instructions to save and run the file.  It will setup your /etc/fstab and mountpoints in /media so you can see your NTFS filesystems in Places> Computer.
2006-06-19T07:03:00.000Z	kevinly		yep it mounts
2006-06-19T07:03:00.000Z	ic56	kevinly	The script will ask you if you want to enable NTFS write.  Answer no.  If you already tried unsuccessfully to add your Windows filesystems to /etc/fstab , add a -b flag to the script invocation.  I authored this version, so I can help if anything goes wrong.
2006-06-19T07:04:00.000Z	kevinly		i want to make it clear
2006-06-19T07:04:00.000Z	kevinly		i have 3 windows partions
2006-06-19T07:04:00.000Z	kevinly		2 of which are fine as ntfs
2006-06-19T07:04:00.000Z	kevinly		and i don't want to damage
2006-06-19T07:04:00.000Z	kevinly		the final one is supposed to be fat32 but doesn't do anything
2006-06-19T07:05:00.000Z	ic56	kevinly	please don't use your [ENTER]  key so much.
2006-06-19T07:06:00.000Z	kevinly	ic56	sorry.
