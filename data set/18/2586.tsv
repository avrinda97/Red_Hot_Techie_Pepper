2010-04-13T22:25:00.000Z	LzrdKing	deathzor	all the time
2010-04-13T22:36:00.000Z	LzrdKing	deathzor	how can i connect my wireless nic from the command line??
2010-04-13T22:41:00.000Z	LzrdKing	deathzor	you around?
2010-04-13T22:41:00.000Z	deathzor	LzrdKing	use iwconfig
2010-04-13T22:44:00.000Z	LzrdKing	deathzor	i had tried it before but i will try it again
2010-04-13T22:44:00.000Z	deathzor	LzrdKing	are you use WPA ?
2010-04-13T22:45:00.000Z	LzrdKing	deathzor	no security :D
2010-04-13T22:46:00.000Z	deathzor	LzrdKing	very secure but yeah iwconfig should do the job then
2010-04-13T22:46:00.000Z	LzrdKing	deathzor	set the essid?
2010-04-13T22:47:00.000Z	deathzor	LzrdKing	essid and channel use iwlist or spy to get the info
2010-04-13T22:48:00.000Z	LzrdKing	deathzor	i know the essid, and it's hidden, if i set channel to auto will it use the right one?
2010-04-13T22:48:00.000Z	deathzor	LzrdKing	you can try
2010-04-13T22:49:00.000Z	LzrdKing	deathzor	when i tried iwconfig before, i set the essid but it didn't associate with my network in anyway
2010-04-13T22:50:00.000Z	LzrdKing	deathzor	was that for me?
2010-04-13T22:51:00.000Z	deathzor	LzrdKing	yes
2010-04-13T22:53:00.000Z	LzrdKing	deathzor	how do i set it to managed?  i don't see that option for iwconfig
