2006-06-29T15:33:00.000Z	mikeo1		knew i shouldnt have upgraded
2006-06-29T15:33:00.000Z	mikeo1		at least windows upgrade doesnt blow up my computer
2006-06-29T15:34:00.000Z	mikeo1		while people are always talking about how ubuntu is going to take over the desktop market
2006-06-29T15:34:00.000Z	mikeo1		it would be nice and all if it did, but i dont see that happening when an upgrade breaks my computer
2006-06-29T15:35:00.000Z	mikeo1		while how do i get around default font fixed
2006-06-29T15:35:00.000Z	mikeo1		where is the fonts dir
2006-06-29T15:36:00.000Z	stefg	mikeo1	have you ever heard of 'the way is the destination' (or whatever the correct translation is)... help us help you by providing the details
2006-06-30T16:30:00.000Z	stefg	mikeo1	then... go dying without fonts... there's a package missing and if you won't figure out what it is, you've got to trust the ubuntu-devs
2006-06-30T16:35:00.000Z	stefg	mikeo1	you have the transcoded font packages, haven't you?
2006-06-30T16:37:00.000Z	stefg	mikeo1	forget my last comment... this was debian. in ubuntu the transcoded fonts seem to be in xfonts-100dpi, xfonts-75dpi and xfonts-base
2007-05-14T06:39:00.000Z	stefg	mikeo1	you need nvidia-glx-legacy for that
2007-05-14T06:41:00.000Z	stefg	mikeo1	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2007-05-14T06:42:00.000Z	stefg	mikeo1	might be an issue of using the standard nvidia-drivers instaed of the nvidia-glx-legacy ones, which are recommended for MX 440
2007-05-14T07:07:00.000Z	stefg	mikeo1	hav you ever taken into account that a venerable mx440 with shared mem wont support such a reso ?
