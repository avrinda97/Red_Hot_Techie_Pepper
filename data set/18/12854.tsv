2009-08-07T13:32:00.000Z	vr		hello
2009-08-07T13:34:00.000Z	vr		I've got a nvidia gforce mx 4000 graphics card in AGP and Ubuntu 8.04. installed in Asrock Mother board, intel 845 chipset. Ubuntu doesn't recognise my Graphics card. Pls help!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2009-08-07T13:35:00.000Z	vr		thank you forlparrot
2009-08-07T13:37:00.000Z	vr		rotlparrot any idea how to fix the card
2009-08-07T13:37:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	vr	it should under hardware drivers, maybe under System in the menu
2009-08-07T13:38:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	vr	so you have installed the drivers but?
2009-08-07T13:40:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	vr	meaning that it's still using the onboard chipset?
2009-08-07T13:40:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	vr	did you try to disable the onboard video graphics? you might need to revert back if things go awry
2009-08-07T13:42:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	vr	in theory if its disabled in the bios, it shouldn't appear in lspci .. hmm pastebin your lspci -k into pastebin please
2009-08-07T13:42:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	vr	yeah but then if both chipsets are visible it may cause the confusion
2009-08-07T13:44:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	vr	I'd try and see if both chipsets are visible via lspci, if so I'd try to blacklist the un-needed one.. reboot and hope that it should boot into x with vesa mode for the nvidia
2009-08-07T13:45:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	vr	if both chipsets are available under lspci.. lspci -k will give you the drivers/modules that are running
2009-08-07T13:46:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	vr	you need to look at lspci -k.. assuming that your built-in is via video chip, there might be a via entry in lspci and lets say lspci -k outputs via chipset using via_video, you need to use your favourite text editor and add blacklist into /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist
2009-08-07T13:50:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	vr	no it shows a list of devices connected via pci bus.. basically on the motherboard.. and it will also show modules in use along with kernel modules.. look for video controller or something, maybe there's two entries and from there once found look for modules in use
2009-08-07T13:51:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	vr	hmm lspci -k should work on ubuntu, can't see why not
2009-08-07T13:52:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	vr	shouldn't matter.. funny how it doesn't have -k switch umm.. guess you'll have to find it manually by comparing lsmod in that case
2009-08-07T13:54:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	vr	you can't blacklist a module without knowing its name
2009-08-07T13:55:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	vr	hmm try man lspci and go to the bottom of that manpage.. tell me the version of the pciutils you got
