2006-11-17T09:19:00.000Z	tgelter		hey all, I mixed up some different version of gtkpod (one from the repos and one from source) and now I can't load gtkpod...it just gives a segmentation fault, dumps a core, and won't start...how can I make things right? (removing and adding gtkpod from aptitude doesn't fix anything)
2006-11-17T09:20:00.000Z	Pelo	tgelter	 delete the config folders for that appl probably a hidden one in your home folder
2007-04-03T08:08:00.000Z	Pelo	tgelter	  make a launcher on your desktop for  xterm
2007-04-03T08:09:00.000Z	tgelter	Pelo	I already have launchers for the terminal, but I want to be able to use the virtual terminal
2007-04-03T08:10:00.000Z	Pelo	tgelter	 are you talking about the alt+f2   run dialog box ?
2007-04-03T08:10:00.000Z	tgelter	Pelo	no, CTRL-ALT-F# for different TTY virtual terminals
2007-05-01T09:41:00.000Z	Pelo	tgelter	 that 's probably because you send a file in there you have no permission to delete
2007-05-01T09:41:00.000Z	tgelter	Pelo	no, it does that with any file I put in it
2007-05-01T09:42:00.000Z	Pelo	tgelter	 chmod 755 ~/.Trash
2007-05-01T09:42:00.000Z	Pelo	tgelter	 errr , sudo chmod ...
2007-05-01T09:43:00.000Z	tgelter	Pelo	I did that and it still complains. says "/home/tgel...rash/blah" cannot be deleted because you do not have permissions to modify its parent folder"
2007-05-01T09:44:00.000Z	Pelo	tgelter	 someone told you to open the trash can and try ctrl+h on it to see if there are hidden files in there
2007-05-01T09:44:00.000Z	tgelter	Pelo	no hidden files
2007-05-01T09:45:00.000Z	Pelo	tgelter	check your users permisson settings, in menu > system > admin > users
2007-05-01T09:46:00.000Z	tgelter	Pelo	permission settings appear correct
2007-05-01T09:46:00.000Z	Pelo	tgelter	 check in the forum for other possibilities
2007-05-01T09:46:00.000Z	Pelo	tgelter	 and there is a file in there ?
2007-05-01T09:47:00.000Z	tgelter	Pelo	no, not currently. the trash empties fine...but it pops up that error every time and it's annoying
