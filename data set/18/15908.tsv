2005-01-11T12:50:00.000Z	Freakwitch		my guess is it will run, but very very slowly
2005-01-11T12:51:00.000Z	Freakwitch		how much swap do you have?
2005-01-11T12:51:00.000Z	Freakwitch		heh, 256MB would be better for that....
2005-01-11T12:52:00.000Z	Freakwitch		my desktop machine is a 400MHz with 256MB....
2005-01-11T12:52:00.000Z	Freakwitch		well, ubuntu is a good choice of distro....
2005-01-11T12:53:00.000Z	Freakwitch		I've heard very good things about xfce4
2005-01-11T12:54:00.000Z	Freakwitch		I was a kde user until I tried ubuntu
2005-01-11T12:54:00.000Z	Freakwitch		now it's gnome
2005-01-11T12:55:00.000Z	Freakwitch		well, I like the simplicity of gnome, except when I don't. ;-)
2005-01-11T12:55:00.000Z	Freakwitch		there are times when I want to tweak something and can't find how to tweak it
2005-01-11T12:55:00.000Z	calc	Freakwitch	for some reason gnome seems to like to have most of the features you want but have them hidden so you don't know how to use them
2005-01-11T12:58:00.000Z	Freakwitch	calc	rhythmbox pisses me off
2005-01-11T12:58:00.000Z	calc	Freakwitch	what problem do you have?
2005-01-11T12:58:00.000Z	calc	Freakwitch	hmm sounds fun
2005-01-11T13:01:00.000Z	Freakwitch	calc	heh, say no more
2005-01-11T13:01:00.000Z	calc	Freakwitch	actually redhat hired him after the fact
2005-01-11T13:12:00.000Z	calc	Freakwitch	totem or totem-xine?
2005-01-11T13:13:00.000Z	calc	Freakwitch	regular totem won't play much unless you have a gstreamer plugin for it
