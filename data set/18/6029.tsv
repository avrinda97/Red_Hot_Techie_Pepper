2008-07-27T15:31:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	gaelfx	there is a tutorial for that... AFAIR

2008-07-27T15:35:00.000Z	gaelfx	arvind_khadri	by the by, running AMD64 version
2008-07-27T15:35:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	gaelfx	:) yup i saw that... have you got the drivers with you ??
2008-07-27T15:36:00.000Z	gaelfx	arvind_khadri	well, I have the drivers for 32-bit XP, but will those work?
2008-07-27T15:37:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	gaelfx	i think they would... in the meantime search for the 64 bit ones
2008-07-27T15:37:00.000Z	gaelfx	arvind_khadri	I found some here: http://www.nforcershq.com/forum/1-vt70968.html?postdays=0&postorder=asc&&start=0
2008-07-27T15:40:00.000Z	gaelfx	arvind_khadri	ok, well, right now I'm still downloading those drivers I sent a link to, and I'm in windows because my connection is crap in Ubuntu, so give me a few minutes
2008-07-27T15:40:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	gaelfx	take your time...but i cant promise you much of help
2008-07-27T15:41:00.000Z	gaelfx	arvind_khadri	well, that's ok, I think most people here are probably ore experienced with NDISWrapper than I am
2008-07-27T15:41:00.000Z	gaelfx	arvind_khadri	so anything you do would be considered help
2008-07-27T15:41:00.000Z	arvind_khadri	gaelfx	:) thanks...
