2009-08-18T01:55:00.000Z	Pseudo_Bob		Hey, I'm trying to install the driver for my Radeon x300- but when I use sh to run the .run file, I get this:

2009-08-18T01:56:00.000Z	Pseudo_Bob		Crap, sorry about that
2009-08-18T01:56:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Pseudo_Bob	check out the README or INSTALL file that should have come with what you downloaded.
2009-08-18T01:57:00.000Z	Pseudo_Bob	prince_jammys	I'm pretty sure it only came iwth the .run
2009-08-18T01:57:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Pseudo_Bob	that sucks.
2009-08-18T02:13:00.000Z	Pseudo_Bob	prince_jammys	I followed a few links and found something useful, but it's telling me to Enable the accelerated ATI graphics driver in Hardware Drivers, which is currently empty.
2009-08-18T02:14:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Pseudo_Bob	mm, I don't know. I'm sorry you have to go through this. I did once with an ATI card and it drove me insane. (I gave up)
2009-08-18T02:14:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Pseudo_Bob	It's a hair-pulling experience, isn't it?
2009-08-18T02:15:00.000Z	Pseudo_Bob	prince_jammys	Well, not yet but I haven't been at it long yet.
2009-08-18T02:16:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Pseudo_Bob	ATI does have a wiki with some help for ubuntu. Check it out if you haven't.
2009-08-18T02:16:00.000Z	Pseudo_Bob	prince_jammys	I'll do that
2009-08-18T03:36:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Pseudo_Bob	from the repos.
