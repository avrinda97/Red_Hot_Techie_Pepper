2008-09-30T03:50:00.000Z	xomp	sanesto	I know, just login at that large screen there with your username/password, you will then be at a prompt. At that prompt type "start x" and press enter.. BOOM HEADSHOT! I mean BOOM Desktop :)
2008-09-30T03:53:00.000Z	sanesto	xomp	start : unknown job:x
2008-09-30T03:54:00.000Z	xomp	sanesto	try without the space "startx"
