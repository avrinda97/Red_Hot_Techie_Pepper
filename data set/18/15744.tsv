2005-02-04T08:16:00.000Z	lanerebel		hey, can anyone tell me what the difference is between regular and recovery modes?
2005-02-04T08:17:00.000Z	tritium	lanerebel	recovery mode is single-user mode, when root needs to fix stuff
2005-02-04T08:18:00.000Z	tritium	lanerebel	what happens when you boot into "normal" mode?
2005-02-04T08:19:00.000Z	lanerebel	tritium	it locks up as soon as it starts gdm, although it's not just due to gdm, because when I did a custom install and booted into regular mode, it locked up after attempting to configure x windows
2005-02-04T08:20:00.000Z	tritium	lanerebel	what video card?
2005-02-04T08:21:00.000Z	lanerebel	tritium	Intel i830... isn't that one that 2.6 has problems with?
2005-02-04T08:21:00.000Z	tritium	lanerebel	I'm not sure about that.
2005-02-04T08:22:00.000Z	lanerebel	tritium	it's a thinkpad, IBM laptop...
2005-02-04T08:56:00.000Z	tritium	lanerebel	are you sure it's not asking for your password?
2005-02-04T08:57:00.000Z	lanerebel	tritium	yes, I tried that already...
2005-02-04T08:57:00.000Z	tritium	lanerebel	which app?
2005-02-04T08:57:00.000Z	lanerebel	tritium	Under Network Tools I clicked configure on one of my ethernet cards (trying to get my wireless card configured)
2005-02-04T08:59:00.000Z	tritium	lanerebel	"Please enter your password" that need your user password
2005-02-04T08:59:00.000Z	lanerebel	tritium	It says please enter root password, I tried mine first
2005-02-04T09:01:00.000Z	tritium	lanerebel	that's not supposed to be the case
2005-02-04T09:01:00.000Z	lanerebel	tritium	I figured that... I'll search on bugzilla...
2005-02-04T09:03:00.000Z	tritium	lanerebel	system configuration programs like that are supposed to ask for the user password.  The first user created during install has priveleges to run those apps.
2005-02-04T09:07:00.000Z	lanerebel	tritium	I got it... I ran sudo passwd to set the root password and am using that...
