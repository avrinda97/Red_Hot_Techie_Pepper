2008-02-01T11:06:00.000Z	biouser		I lost my downloads in firefox.  They always came to the desktop now the download window doesn't come up and I can't find the file
2008-02-01T11:06:00.000Z	gmcastil	biouser	probably in ~/Desktop
2008-02-01T11:07:00.000Z	gmcastil	biouser	or, you can just open a terminal and do: find | grep <filename>
2008-02-01T11:07:00.000Z	biouser	gmcastil	thanks, not in /Desktop though.  THanks fo the grep syntax
2008-02-01T11:08:00.000Z	gmcastil	biouser	not /Desktop - ~/Desktop
2008-02-01T11:08:00.000Z	biouser	gmcastil	yeah, that's what I meant
2008-02-01T11:10:00.000Z	gmcastil	biouser	open firefox and press Ctrl-Y
2008-02-01T11:10:00.000Z	gmcastil	biouser	it'll show you in the dialog box where files are being downloaded
2008-02-01T11:11:00.000Z	biouser	gmcastil	thanks for the tip.  so, it's not downloading recently for some reason
2008-02-01T11:11:00.000Z	biouser	gmcastil	seacat 'open with' works but not save to disk
2008-02-01T11:13:00.000Z	biouser	gmcastil	when I 'open with' the file goes to ~tmp and I can view it fine and it shows up in the downloads.  But, if I 'save to disk' nothing happens
2008-02-01T11:18:00.000Z	gmcastil	biouser	open a terminal, then: "chown biouser:biouser -Rv ~/Desktop
2008-02-01T11:18:00.000Z	gmcastil	biouser	how did it get root ownership/
2008-02-01T11:19:00.000Z	biouser	gmcastil	I don't know how that happened.  But, changing the ownership did work just now
2008-02-01T11:19:00.000Z	gmcastil	biouser	you go it?
2008-02-01T11:19:00.000Z	biouser	gmcastil	brilliant!  thank you so much!
2008-02-01T11:19:00.000Z	gmcastil	biouser	yup
2008-02-01T11:20:00.000Z	biouser	gmcastil	that is pretty strange
