2009-04-05T16:14:00.000Z	kravlin	ssd	when you download them open appearances and drag them onto the window.
2009-04-05T16:15:00.000Z	ssd	kravlin	but thats only for gtk / gdm themes only no ?
2009-04-05T16:16:00.000Z	kravlin	ssd	could be. I've only used gnome unfortunately.
2009-04-05T16:17:00.000Z	ssd	kravlin	its working
2009-04-05T16:23:00.000Z	kravlin	ssd	gnome-look has some interesting stuff but most of it is for emerald which is avalible in the repos.
2009-04-05T16:23:00.000Z	ssd	kravlin	and emerald cant be used without compiz yes ?
2009-04-05T16:24:00.000Z	kravlin	ssd	yeah, but compiz is generally installed with ubuntu.
2009-04-05T16:26:00.000Z	kravlin	ssd	i only have Compiz not Compiz config manager.
2009-04-05T16:27:00.000Z	ssd	kravlin	aar : i want only have nice desktop look...i dont need stuff like compiz cube, fire writing etc
2009-04-05T16:29:00.000Z	ssd	kravlin	cant find desktop effects x(
2009-04-05T16:31:00.000Z	kravlin	ssd	System>Prefrences>Appearance>Visual Effects
2009-04-05T16:32:00.000Z	ssd	kravlin	but there are only window effects
2009-04-05T16:34:00.000Z	kravlin	ssd	what effects are you looking for to change?
2009-04-05T16:35:00.000Z	ssd	kravlin	we talking about Compiz and desktop look...like gtk ...som iam looking for this
2009-04-05T16:36:00.000Z	ssd	kravlin	you said that this can be done by compiz too...so...and i am asked where i can configure/ browse which compiz themes are preinstalled
2009-04-05T16:38:00.000Z	kravlin	ssd	by default there aren't any themes for your desktop installed. you'll have to find them off websites such as gnome-look etc.
2009-04-05T16:40:00.000Z	kravlin	ssd	and unfortunately i can't help you with that.
