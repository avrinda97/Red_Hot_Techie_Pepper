2007-10-22T16:29:00.000Z	JebJoya		and yes, it is me draggles :)
2007-10-22T16:30:00.000Z	JebJoya		rightyho, admittedly this may be difficult as i can't access IRC from my room (stupid Uni ResNet) so I'm in the Maths Dept, but...  I'm having an issue since upgrading to 7.10 in so much as my ntfs drives have disappeared (had them before using the ntfs-3g method) - any suggestions how to get them back?
2007-10-22T16:31:00.000Z	MenZa	JebJoya	Hmm, ntfs-3g is standard in Gutsy. Can you see them in sudo fdisk -l?
2007-10-22T16:32:00.000Z	MenZa	JebJoya	Try again. Paste the output to a pastebin.
2007-10-22T16:32:00.000Z	JebJoya	MenZa	i'm 10 minute walk from my PC :(
2007-10-22T16:32:00.000Z	MenZa	JebJoya	Setup openssh and ssh to it?
2007-10-22T16:33:00.000Z	MenZa	JebJoya	Why :P?
2007-10-22T16:33:00.000Z	MenZa	JebJoya	sudo aptitude install openssh-server, note down the IP and ssh to it from your machine :D
2007-10-22T16:33:00.000Z	MenZa	JebJoya	meh, Windows contains several servers by default, including rdp :)
2007-10-22T16:33:00.000Z	MenZa	JebJoya	The idea's about the same
2007-10-22T16:34:00.000Z	JebJoya	MenZa	I know, that's the joke of it :)
2007-10-22T16:37:00.000Z	JebJoya	MenZa	I set up a thread here http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=585950 last night, will pastebin my sudo fdisk -l to there in about 10-15 mins.
2007-10-22T16:37:00.000Z	MenZa	JebJoya	I'll subscribe to it and look in 15-20 minutes then :)=
