2008-07-06T12:20:00.000Z	Flux-D		Sorry to ask this again but can anyone give me the result of uname -r from the server and destop versions of Ubuntu
2008-07-06T12:22:00.000Z	unop	Flux-D	that is a silly request -- it could be anything on another person's machine -- not everyone is running the same version of the linux kernel - some old, some new, some not so old or not so new  -- what are you actually trying to do?
2008-07-06T12:24:00.000Z	Flux-D	unop	I am just looking for the default info, I am planning on compiling a new kernel, and wanted to see what one ubuntu default uses
2008-07-06T12:25:00.000Z	unop	Flux-D	packages.ubuntu.com should tell you
2008-07-06T12:25:00.000Z	Flux-D	unop	whats the package name?
2008-07-06T12:26:00.000Z	unop	Flux-D	linux-image
2008-07-06T12:29:00.000Z	Flux-D	unop	so if I install the linux-image-2.6.24-16-server or linux-image package, then reboot, and select it from grub I can get the old version back ?
2008-07-06T12:30:00.000Z	unop	Flux-D	indeed
2008-07-06T12:30:00.000Z	unop	Flux-D	but beware the server image is optimized for server machines -- not ideal for desktops
2008-07-06T12:31:00.000Z	Flux-D	unop	my box is in a datacenter, they compiled their own version of kernel and use it with ubuntu 8.04, I would like to use the ubuntu default one, will this also work for that?
2008-07-06T12:32:00.000Z	unop	Flux-D	yes -- but you should choose the appropriate one for your machine and the tasks it does - is it a server machine?
2008-07-06T12:33:00.000Z	Flux-D	unop	yes server install, then I installed ubunut-desktop on it for gui and using nx to view gui
2008-07-06T12:34:00.000Z	unop	Flux-D	right, but what does your machine do primarily? serve content or cater to your desktop needs?
2008-07-06T12:35:00.000Z	Flux-D	unop	kinda both, gui is usually off though but nx runs if I need gui
2008-07-06T12:35:00.000Z	unop	Flux-D	then i would say - use the server kernel
2008-07-06T12:36:00.000Z	Flux-D	unop	so once again grab the server kernel deb, install it reboot and select the new kernel from grub, does this also get me header files to comppile stuff?
2008-07-06T12:37:00.000Z	unop	Flux-D	don't manually download and install -- use apt-get -- since it handles all the dependencies  -- yes, reboot and you should be able to choose the new kernel -- no, it does not get the headers to compile stuff -- you need the linux-headers package
2008-07-06T12:44:00.000Z	Flux-D	unop	whats the diff between the -generic and -386 from kernel names?
