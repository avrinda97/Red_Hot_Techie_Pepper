2011-08-09T11:43:00.000Z	Starminn	theadmin	I know. I intend on it. It could easily replace a desktop at this point.
2011-08-09T11:44:00.000Z	theadmin	Starminn	lol true, true
2011-08-09T11:44:00.000Z	theadmin	Starminn	Mind if I PM you here?
2011-08-09T11:45:00.000Z	Starminn	theadmin	So long as it's not about support.
2011-08-09T11:45:00.000Z	theadmin	Starminn	Naturally lol
2012-01-13T11:55:00.000Z	theadmin	Starminn	Does it create anything in /dev?
2012-01-13T11:57:00.000Z	Starminn	theadmin	What am I looking for? Just a new partition label?
2012-01-13T11:57:00.000Z	theadmin	Starminn	Well something like /dev/sdb1 probably. If you have a label on the stick's partition, you may search for that label under /dev/disk/by-label/
2012-01-13T11:58:00.000Z	Starminn	theadmin	Yes, a new partition label is created. So are you thinking to mount it manually via CLI?
2012-01-13T11:59:00.000Z	theadmin	Starminn	Probably yes, also check if something's wrong with your gvfs setup
2012-01-13T11:59:00.000Z	Starminn	theadmin	At this point in time nearly everything has gone wrong with this install. I am reinstalling, which is why I'm doing flash drives. To save my files. :)
2012-01-13T11:59:00.000Z	theadmin	Starminn	Ah, I see, lol
2012-01-13T12:00:00.000Z	Starminn	theadmin	I clearly see a file for "/dev/sdb" and "/dev/sdb1" but when I attempt to mount it gives me, "mount: can't find /dev/sdb1 in /etc/fstab or /etc/mtab"
2012-01-13T12:01:00.000Z	theadmin	Starminn	Uh, specify the mount point, something like: sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt
2012-01-13T12:02:00.000Z	Starminn	theadmin	Thank you very much, sir. IT works beautifully.
2012-01-13T12:03:00.000Z	theadmin	Starminn	More like "madam" or something, actually, if you prefer being that polite :P
2012-01-13T12:03:00.000Z	Starminn	theadmin	Ah, well my apologies then. :) Thank you very much, madam. It works beautifully. :)
