2008-07-05T09:20:00.000Z	merula	hyperstream	check out compiz-fusion and emerald
2008-07-05T09:21:00.000Z	hyperstream	merula	 im thinking more of customized window borders and such,
2008-07-05T09:21:00.000Z	merula	hyperstream	use emerald. That's what I've got and it works great, especially with a black border/theme and the standard orange ubuntu theme. Very flashy, very nice.
2008-07-05T09:23:00.000Z	merula	hyperstream	no prob. Just do a google of emerald and themes and the first link should be to a reliable site.
2008-07-05T09:23:00.000Z	hyperstream	merula	 excelent :)
2008-07-05T09:34:00.000Z	hyperstream	merula	whats the name of your theme?
2008-07-05T09:35:00.000Z	merula	hyperstream	um... let me look.
2008-07-05T09:35:00.000Z	hyperstream	merula	thanks mate
2008-07-05T09:35:00.000Z	merula	hyperstream	I'm using "83626-vision black" for my emerald theme.  I'd like to get it working for gnome too, but meh...
2008-07-05T09:39:00.000Z	hyperstream	merula	once ive imported it how does one activate it ?
2008-07-05T09:41:00.000Z	merula	hyperstream	um... go to System>Preferences>Emerald Theme Manager -- if it's not there, you might want to make sure it was installed.
2008-07-05T09:41:00.000Z	hyperstream	merula	i did that i had to import the .emerald file its there listed
2008-07-05T09:42:00.000Z	merula	hyperstream	hmmm, just click it and click okay. It will apply either immediately or on next reboot of X.
2008-07-05T09:51:00.000Z	hyperstream	merula	yeah even after a reboot, i have 2 emeral theme's importated but they wont activate
2008-07-05T09:53:00.000Z	hyperstream	merula	 i think he has something to do with System - Pref - Appearance
2008-07-05T09:54:00.000Z	merula	hyperstream	bleh. I have no idea. I managed to click it, then click "quit" and it works for me -- yeah, try that. I really just bumbled my way through the setup.
2008-07-05T10:00:00.000Z	hyperstream	merula	just had to use the gkt version of slickness
