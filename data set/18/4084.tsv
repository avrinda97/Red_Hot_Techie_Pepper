2009-06-05T22:55:00.000Z	bushpig		ideas
2009-06-05T22:57:00.000Z	cabrey	bushpig	plug the hdd directly into the ubuntu machine
2009-06-05T22:58:00.000Z	bushpig	cabrey	... the ubunto machine is this laptop, the HD is a big desktop job, I do not have connecting cable to do so
2009-06-05T22:58:00.000Z	cabrey	bushpig	you don't happen to have an enclosure do you?
2009-06-05T22:59:00.000Z	bushpig	cabrey	> enclosure?  All I have is an icybox NAS which I have never used before,
2009-06-05T22:59:00.000Z	cabrey	bushpig	what do you mean detected?
2009-06-05T23:00:00.000Z	bushpig	cabrey	> vista showed its existance in 'my computer' and in network connections I believe....but because it is ReiserFS it cannot read it, and there are only 2 complicated to install apps for vista and reiser so i opted for linux live cd instead
2009-06-05T23:01:00.000Z	cabrey	bushpig	do you know the IP of the NAS box?
2009-06-05T23:02:00.000Z	bushpig	cabrey	> the documentation gave me a a few default IP's but ther browser did not find them
2009-06-05T23:02:00.000Z	cabrey	bushpig	Places > Network comes up with nothing?
2009-06-05T23:03:00.000Z	bushpig	cabrey	> theres 'windows network' is that just a defaulkt icon in there ? if i click on it it says it cannot find any shares
2009-06-05T23:04:00.000Z	cabrey	bushpig	if you find the IP of the NAS, then you can open smb://IP.Address.Goes.Here in Nautilus
2009-06-05T23:05:00.000Z	bushpig	cabrey	should beable to do it http from web browser also ?
2009-06-05T23:05:00.000Z	cabrey	bushpig	not if you want to access files
2009-06-05T23:09:00.000Z	bushpig	cabrey	> where do i add the path in nautilis ? connect to server ?
2009-06-05T23:10:00.000Z	cabrey	bushpig	you can do it that way
