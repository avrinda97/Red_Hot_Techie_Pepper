2010-12-24T10:58:00.000Z	randomdude		Hello i have redirected the logs of my computer to a tty, i wonder if theres a way to get that output into x in a pts type of console
2010-12-24T11:00:00.000Z	sacarlson	randomdude	I would think you want to look a changes in your logs so you might look at using tail -f  /path/to/log/file
2010-12-24T11:02:00.000Z	sacarlson	randomdude	I'm not sure why you want to redirect but you could tail -f /path/to/logfile >/path/to/redirected/log
2010-12-24T11:04:00.000Z	randomdude	sacarlson	i would like to have a live feed of the logs if necessary in a console inside X, i normaly log em to /dev/tty8 via *.* in syslog
2010-12-24T11:06:00.000Z	sacarlson	randomdude	we normaly use a terminal in x called gnome-terminal  with that you can ssh into remotes or look at local points with tail -f ...
2010-12-24T11:07:00.000Z	randomdude	sacarlson	can i tail the outpout of a tty?
2010-12-24T11:08:00.000Z	sacarlson	randomdude	I'm not even sure what tty is. I use terminals
2010-12-24T11:09:00.000Z	randomdude	sacarlson	thanks for trying anyway
2010-12-24T11:09:00.000Z	sacarlson	randomdude	have you tried gnome-terminal?
2010-12-24T11:10:00.000Z	randomdude	sacarlson	yeah dont worry look hit ctrl alt and f1 then ctrl alt and f7 back
2010-12-24T11:10:00.000Z	sacarlson	randomdude	so your not in the X server then when you want to view?
2010-12-24T11:11:00.000Z	sacarlson	randomdude	have you tried ssh?
2010-12-24T11:12:00.000Z	sacarlson	randomdude	yes I view logs from ssh all the time
2010-12-24T11:13:00.000Z	sacarlson	randomdude	start gnome-terminal;  ssh ipofhostwithlogs; tail -f /path/to/log/file
2010-12-24T11:15:00.000Z	sacarlson	randomdude	well turn that off and use tail
2010-12-24T11:16:00.000Z	sacarlson	randomdude	oh so there is no disk space for the logs so you need to output it in this method?
2010-12-24T11:17:00.000Z	randomdude	sacarlson	logs are already being filed, but in separate ones, this is like a supervision interface
2010-12-24T11:18:00.000Z	sacarlson	randomdude	so what would viewing from tty differ from the view from tail -f?
