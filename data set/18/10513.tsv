2011-07-08T23:18:00.000Z	shane2peru		is there a way to output diff to an html file?  so that I can look at the differences in two texts?
2011-07-08T23:18:00.000Z	shane2peru		in a clean format?
2011-07-08T23:18:00.000Z	dr_willis	shane2peru	  sounds like the kind of thing a perls script proberly exists for...
2011-07-08T23:19:00.000Z	dr_willis	shane2peru	 or use 'colordiff'
2011-07-08T23:19:00.000Z	shane2peru	dr_willis	colordiff!  That sounds like what I'm looking for, thanks!!!
2011-07-08T23:19:00.000Z	shane2peru	dr_willis	I kept looking for diff2html, but it no longer seems to exist.
2011-07-08T23:19:00.000Z	dr_willis	shane2peru	 theres a log colorizer. and colormake and a few other color-tools as well. i think theres some grep colorizer also
2011-07-08T23:22:00.000Z	shane2peru	dr_willis	thanks!
2011-07-08T23:48:00.000Z	shane2peru	dr_willis	unfortunately, it colordiff doesn't export as html. :(  I'm going to have to look for a script I guess.
2011-07-08T23:49:00.000Z	dr_willis	shane2peru	 the power of perl! :)
2011-07-08T23:50:00.000Z	shane2peru	dr_willis	perhaps, but I barely do bash
2011-07-08T23:50:00.000Z	dr_willis	shane2peru	 should i mention. that I do recall there being some gui diff front ends...
2011-07-08T23:50:00.000Z	shane2peru	dr_willis	I'm doing large docs and want to compare the differences, a long study, so I want a universal format, as for the gui right there is kompare, and tkdiff both decent.
2011-07-08T23:51:00.000Z	shane2peru	dr_willis	here we go:  http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/convert-diff-output-colorized-html    and it is even bash. :)
2011-07-08T23:51:00.000Z	dr_willis	shane2peru	 large docs.. ok. :)  i just use diff  for config files
2011-07-08T23:51:00.000Z	dr_willis	shane2peru	 i do recall some gui diff front end.. but cant find it now.
2011-07-08T23:51:00.000Z	shane2peru	dr_willis	right, this is more of a long term study, not a quick config fix
2011-07-08T23:52:00.000Z	shane2peru	dr_willis	kompare and tkdiff are the two front end guis I found and tried.  both decent, but I want a generic format that I can use anywhere
