2011-06-17T20:47:00.000Z	sipior	Jamshoot	dying drive, i would imagine
2011-06-17T20:48:00.000Z	sipior	Jamshoot	possibly just a bad connection.
2011-06-17T20:48:00.000Z	sipior	Jamshoot	consider running smartmontools on the drive and see what comes up.
2011-06-17T20:48:00.000Z	Jamshoot	sipior	this is bad... However, i can mount it from live usb (cd)...
2011-06-17T20:49:00.000Z	sipior	Jamshoot	then make sure you have a reliable copy of the data therein
2011-06-17T20:50:00.000Z	Jamshoot	sipior	i tried smart tools, test throws this ->

2011-06-17T20:51:00.000Z	sipior	Jamshoot	time for a replacement drive.
2011-06-17T20:51:00.000Z	sipior	Jamshoot	at least plug in a spare to verify that it's not a problem with the controller &cet.
2011-06-17T20:52:00.000Z	Jamshoot	sipior	=\ he is too young to die =)
2011-06-17T20:52:00.000Z	sipior	Jamshoot	if only the world worked that way...
