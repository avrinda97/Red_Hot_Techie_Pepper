2012-01-07T06:32:00.000Z	haylo		i have done a ton of ubuntu installs and never seen this SVNDR
2012-01-07T06:33:00.000Z	haylo		i suggest you make the usb in a linux control enviornment: a live cd, usb
2012-01-07T06:34:00.000Z	haylo		make a live cd, then run start up disk creator inside of it
2012-01-07T06:34:00.000Z	haylo		make a usb that isnt tainted by your previous system
2012-01-07T06:34:00.000Z	haylo		did you format yo FAT?
2012-01-07T06:34:00.000Z	haylo		to*yo?
2012-01-07T06:35:00.000Z	haylo		nah im not an admin sorry
2012-01-07T06:35:00.000Z	haylo		stay on parsnip i think he is
2012-01-07T06:36:00.000Z	haylo		but i made a lot of live cds and usb as a newb and a lot of them failed, but alot worked as well - good luck :)
2012-01-07T06:36:00.000Z	SVNDR	haylo	thanks, i think ill need it.. i also think im just going to try from CD when i can
2012-01-07T06:31:00.000Z	haylo	SVNDR	it doesnt usually do that for me
2012-01-07T06:31:00.000Z	haylo	SVNDR	sounds like that usb connection is sucky
2012-01-07T06:32:00.000Z	SVNDR	haylo	yea, im guessing its not supposed it.. its USB 2.0, and 16GB hardrive.. so i dont understand why it would though..
2012-01-07T06:34:00.000Z	SVNDR	haylo	do you have a url to a guide i could use.. newb to linux
2012-01-07T06:35:00.000Z	SVNDR	haylo	yes
2012-01-07T06:37:00.000Z	haylo	SVNDR	cd and dvd is what ended up really working for me :)
2012-01-07T06:38:00.000Z	SVNDR	haylo	might be my way to go then ;p
