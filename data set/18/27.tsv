2005-01-29T07:34:00.000Z	phuzzy		hi, i'm new to ubuntu and i'm hoping someone can help me
2005-01-29T07:35:00.000Z	phuzzy		haha i used to use Redhat WAY back in the day
2005-01-29T07:35:00.000Z	phuzzy		i think the first distribution i had was redhat 5.0
2005-01-29T07:35:00.000Z	phuzzy		but i'm stumped
2005-01-29T07:35:00.000Z	phuzzy		never used debian before
2005-01-29T07:37:00.000Z	phuzzy		well, here's my problem... i'm trying to play my MP3s right... and being a good little windows refugee, i mistankenly left the other partitions on my drive as NTFS
2005-01-29T07:37:00.000Z	phuzzy		how do i compile NTFS write support?
2005-01-29T07:39:00.000Z	phuzzy		i can mount the file system just fine -- in read only
2005-01-29T07:40:00.000Z	phuzzy		ok, so i guess my only other option is to copy everything from that partion to my ext3 partion, then reformat the partition?
2005-01-29T07:40:00.000Z	jdub	phuzzy	you can *read* from ntfs, but not write.
2005-01-29T07:42:00.000Z	jdub	phuzzy	install gstreamer0.8-mad.
2005-01-29T07:43:00.000Z	jdub	phuzzy	in synaptic or with apt-get
2005-01-29T07:43:00.000Z	jdub	phuzzy	if you've just installed, you'll have to enable universe (the collection of unsupported software built from debian)
2005-01-29T07:45:00.000Z	jdub	phuzzy	both the wiki and ubuntuguide.org
2005-01-29T07:45:00.000Z	jdub	phuzzy	computer > system configuration > synaptic package manager
2005-01-29T07:48:00.000Z	jdub	phuzzy	gstreamer0.8-mad
2005-01-29T07:49:00.000Z	jdub	phuzzy	you need to enable universe
2005-01-29T07:49:00.000Z	jdub	phuzzy	settings > repositories, uncomment the universe deb lines
