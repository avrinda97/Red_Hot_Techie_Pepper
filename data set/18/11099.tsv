2006-09-16T06:16:00.000Z	inglor		my laptop, an Asus works but the hardware wireless on/off switch does not
2006-09-16T06:16:00.000Z	inglor		when I click fn+f2 it does nothing

2006-09-16T06:16:00.000Z	THX-1138	inglor	- xmodmap maybe to assign the button to a command?
2006-09-16T06:18:00.000Z	THX-1138	inglor	it show the codes each keypress gives
2006-09-16T06:26:00.000Z	THX-1138	inglor	- xmodmap Okay?
2006-09-16T06:29:00.000Z	THX-1138	inglor	- the link on configuring a keyboard or mouse will give you the path to assigning that key.
2006-09-16T06:32:00.000Z	THX-1138	inglor	- each key gives a hexadecimal code to the operating system once you have that hex code it can be easily assigned to any command or button device you like. nifty eh?
2006-09-16T06:58:00.000Z	THX-1138	inglor	- can you start and stop radio with sudo /etc/ini.d/radio stop   or  start?    - if so map that command in a script  xmodmap will hellp you
2006-09-16T07:01:00.000Z	THX-1138	inglor	- someone here knows/ alas not me. - helped where i could
2006-09-16T07:08:00.000Z	THX-1138	inglor	- i found this - no way here to try it for you.  :-/      http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=155980
2006-09-16T09:27:00.000Z	THX-1138	inglor	- it is certainly the long way around but the FCC number will give some info that you can use on  http://www.FCC.gov  - if the keyboard manufacturer will give you what you need for linux
