2010-03-10T02:53:00.000Z	treble54		whats the default directory for Firefox on ubuntu (8.10+) ?
2010-03-10T02:53:00.000Z	jrib	treble54	why?
2010-03-10T02:54:00.000Z	treble54	jrib	I'm asking b/c I'm trying to figure out if I have two installations of Firefox
2010-03-10T02:54:00.000Z	jrib	treble54	that would only happen if you installed something not using the repositories
2010-03-10T02:54:00.000Z	treble54	jrib	correct, I did
2010-03-10T02:55:00.000Z	jrib	treble54	what do you want to accomplish?
2010-03-10T02:55:00.000Z	treble54	jrib	I'd like to have a copy of Firefox 3.5 since a website I'm trying to view is not compatible with Firefox 3.6
2010-03-10T02:56:00.000Z	treble54	jrib	I'd prefer not downgrading :(
2010-03-10T02:56:00.000Z	jrib	treble54	firefox should be 3.5 in karmic, is it not?
2010-03-10T02:56:00.000Z	jrib	treble54	what does "manually upgraded" mean?
2010-03-10T02:56:00.000Z	treble54	jrib	I use ubuntuzilla to get the latest Firefox releases
2010-03-10T02:57:00.000Z	jrib	treble54	grab the tar.gz from mozilla for the version you want and install it to /opt I suppose
2010-03-10T02:58:00.000Z	treble54	jrib	thx
2010-03-10T02:58:00.000Z	jrib	treble54	though I can imagine that may cause issues if there were some changes to how firefox saves preferences in ~/.mozilla/ .  It's probably okay, but you should check
2010-03-10T02:58:00.000Z	jrib	treble54	or just use a different location for the /opt copy
2010-03-10T02:59:00.000Z	jrib	treble54	it's also really strange that a website would break going from 3.5 to 3.6
2010-03-10T02:59:00.000Z	treble54	jrib	yeah, it probably will cause some problems with ~/.mozilla
2010-03-10T02:59:00.000Z	treble54	jrib	well, apparently its happened, although I have yet to see the website that I've been confirmed is working fine when using firefox 3.5
