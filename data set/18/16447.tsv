2004-12-23T15:27:00.000Z	neoxed		any one know how i can open port 4662?
2004-12-23T15:27:00.000Z	crimsun	neoxed	it's open by default. Ubuntu does not use firewalling software by default.
2004-12-23T15:28:00.000Z	crimsun	neoxed	if you need to forward the port from your router, you'll need to check your router's documentation. If the router is provided by your ISP, perhaps your ISP's support web site has more details.
2004-12-23T15:28:00.000Z	crimsun	neoxed	use a paste web site, please :)
2004-12-23T15:30:00.000Z	crimsun	neoxed	is there another program using tpc/4662?
2004-12-23T15:31:00.000Z	crimsun	neoxed	netstat -ntl|grep 4662
2004-12-23T15:32:00.000Z	crimsun	neoxed	some program is already listening on port 4662. You may use `netstat -ntlp|grep 4662' to find which.
2004-12-24T13:30:00.000Z	crimsun	neoxed	it's not dpkg's fault; it's the package's
2004-12-24T13:30:00.000Z	crimsun	neoxed	what's the error above that?
2004-12-24T13:32:00.000Z	crimsun	neoxed	is something else listening on tcp/21?
2004-12-24T13:32:00.000Z	crimsun	neoxed	netstat -ntpl|grep 21
2004-12-24T13:33:00.000Z	crimsun	neoxed	inetd is already listening on 21, which implies you probably have another ftp daemon configured to use inetd
2004-12-24T13:34:00.000Z	crimsun	neoxed	try `sudo invoke-rc.d inetd stop'
2004-12-25T14:46:00.000Z	crimsun	neoxed	what video card?
2004-12-25T14:46:00.000Z	crimsun	neoxed	warty or hoary?
2004-12-25T14:47:00.000Z	crimsun	neoxed	please use a paste web site to paste the output of: lspci -v -s 01:00.0
2004-12-25T14:53:00.000Z	crimsun	neoxed	thanks. Next time please read my entire request regarding a paste web site. :)
2004-12-25T14:54:00.000Z	crimsun	neoxed	paste.plone.org and pastebin.com are two examples
