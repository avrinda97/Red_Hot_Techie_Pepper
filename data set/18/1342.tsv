2011-03-21T08:20:00.000Z	b1lly		fglrx 2523725  100
2011-03-21T08:21:00.000Z	edbian	b1lly	That means you installed fglrx.  sudo apt-get purge fglrx
2011-03-21T08:21:00.000Z	edbian	b1lly	that command will remove it.
2011-03-21T08:18:00.000Z	edbian	b1lly	Just remove them
2011-03-21T08:19:00.000Z	edbian	b1lly	What driver did it install?  fglrx ?
2011-03-21T08:20:00.000Z	edbian	b1lly	what is the output of lsmod | grep fglrx   ?
2011-03-21T08:22:00.000Z	edbian	b1lly	lsmod lists all the modules that are currently being used.  (linux calles drivers modules) so yes.
2011-03-21T08:22:00.000Z	edbian	b1lly	grep just filters the list to show only things with 'fglrx' in the name
2011-03-21T08:23:00.000Z	edbian	b1lly	lsmod lists them all.  lsmod | grep fglrx will show the rows that have fglrx in them.
2011-03-21T08:24:00.000Z	edbian	b1lly	After you remove the package (sudo apt-get purge fglrx) restart the machine
2011-03-21T08:24:00.000Z	edbian	b1lly	It doesn't stand for anything.  It's a great name on it's on I guess.  It filters the output of lsmod
2011-03-21T08:25:00.000Z	edbian	b1lly	You can grep anything though.  Like a file,  grep banana somefile.txt    will show all the lines of somefile.txt that contain 'banana'
2011-03-21T08:27:00.000Z	b1lly	edbian	shut down pc or restart?
2011-03-21T08:27:00.000Z	edbian	b1lly	Is there a difference?
