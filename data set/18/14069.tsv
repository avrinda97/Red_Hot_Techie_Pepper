2005-11-21T13:13:00.000Z	_smd_		I have a question, if i find an image I like on the internet, and i rght click and go save as wallpaper, and nothing changes, and even if i save it, and then go save to wallpaper again, and it will not change,  is there a way to refresh my desktop?
2005-11-21T13:15:00.000Z	_smd_		but if i right click again and go.. change desktop background, and nothing still does not change.
