2005-02-22T15:22:00.000Z	BiteMeBill	tatterdemalionpr	nope
2005-02-22T15:37:00.000Z	BiteMeBill	tatterdemalionpr	You asked about domain names and dns didn't you.
2005-02-22T15:38:00.000Z	BiteMeBill	tatterdemalionpr	Are you getting a static line with your own block or IP's?
2005-02-22T15:39:00.000Z	BiteMeBill	tatterdemalionpr	I'm using no-ip.com right now.
2005-02-22T15:41:00.000Z	BiteMeBill	tatterdemalionpr	at the same time you are hosting on your ISP's IP block.
2005-02-22T15:44:00.000Z	BiteMeBill	tatterdemalionpr	go to godaddy.com and register a domain name for around $8 a yr and then find someone to host your dns...
