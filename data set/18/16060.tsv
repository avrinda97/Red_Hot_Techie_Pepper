I dont wanna ask every question I have here because I know only 1 out of a big group is not gonna get ticked off , so I would like to know where to learn , like installing, running, etc
2004-11-19T09:25:00.000Z	RoBLiNuX_		:) I like it because it comes with gaim, x-chat, mozilla firefox so it saved me from installing them ,
2004-11-19T09:26:00.000Z	RoBLiNuX_		Thanks treenaks
2004-11-19T09:26:00.000Z	RoBLiNuX_		I mean on my laptop here I have a few manuals on linux I downloaded so I'm gonna read them too

2004-11-19T09:27:00.000Z	RoBLiNuX_		thanks housetier for the advice and treenaks!
2004-11-19T09:27:00.000Z	RoBLiNuX_		You folks use window ?
2004-11-19T09:29:00.000Z	RoBLiNuX_		treenaks you said for me to open terminal (shell) but in system tools it says root terminal or terminal
2004-11-19T09:31:00.000Z	RoBLiNuX_		so i type man man
2004-11-19T09:32:00.000Z	WebMaven	RoBLiNuX_	man <command> usually gives you instructions on using that command.
2004-11-19T09:32:00.000Z	WebMaven	RoBLiNuX_	so man man give syou instructions on using the man command.
2004-11-19T09:40:00.000Z	WebMaven	RoBLiNuX_	depends on what you mean by 'learn'.
2004-11-19T09:42:00.000Z	WebMaven	RoBLiNuX_	you can forget about defragging.
2004-11-19T09:46:00.000Z	WebMaven	RoBLiNuX_	there are plenty of firewalls avalibale, both to run as an end-user systema, and as a firewall for the rest of the nework.
2004-11-19T09:46:00.000Z	WebMaven	RoBLiNuX_	so, you can take an otherwise underpowered old computer stick an extra $13 network-card in, and you have a corporate firewall for your network.
2004-11-19T09:48:00.000Z	RoBLiNuX_	WebMaven	i have my laptop is dsl/router + software firewall already i purchased a router no need for more but you know you never 100% nobody wants me anyways lol its just incase if I get trojans on windows or something wants to connect out or in or whenever im on a file sharing p2p prog
2004-11-19T09:48:00.000Z	WebMaven	RoBLiNuX_	here is some advice: Don't run as root. Sometimes desktop internet software (like XChat) can be vulnerable.
