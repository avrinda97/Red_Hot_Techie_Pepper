2011-08-06T23:01:00.000Z	Gasseus		How do I make a wallpaper that changes itself once in a while?
2011-08-06T23:03:00.000Z	escott	Gasseus	write a script that calls out to gconftool-2 --set /desktop/gnome/background/picture_filename --type string "filename_goes_here"
2011-08-06T23:05:00.000Z	Gasseus	escott	does unity still use gconftool-2? I thought it moved to something completely different...
2011-08-06T23:06:00.000Z	escott	Gasseus	unity in 11.04 is still based on gnome2 so yes. not sure what will happen with 11.10 it may have to be something gsettings related
2011-08-06T23:06:00.000Z	Gasseus	escott	Well, the current 11.10 repos have gnome3 rather then gnome 2.30
2011-08-17T05:12:00.000Z	escott	Gasseus	just reinstall
2011-08-17T05:13:00.000Z	Gasseus	escott	Really? That your answer to everything?
2012-03-24T02:18:00.000Z	escott	Gasseus	does it say anything when it flops?
2012-03-24T02:18:00.000Z	Gasseus	escott	no. It says "detecting disks", once that bar fills up, it goes to a blank blue screen and the cd drive indicator turns off.
2012-03-24T02:19:00.000Z	escott	Gasseus	have you tried booting to the livecd instead of the installer and using gparted to see if you can manipulate the disk partitions
2012-03-24T02:20:00.000Z	Gasseus	escott	the livecd won't run on this machine.
2012-03-24T02:21:00.000Z	escott	Gasseus	and how does the livecd fail?
2012-03-24T02:21:00.000Z	Gasseus	escott	not enough ram (1 gb, always complains about ram)
2012-03-24T02:22:00.000Z	Gasseus	escott	... I AM using the alternate
2012-03-24T02:23:00.000Z	escott	Gasseus	you should be able to get to a console maybe ctrl-alt-f2 and use fdisk from there to verify that it can partition
2012-03-24T02:24:00.000Z	Gasseus	escott	mmk... rebooting I'll try that out.
2012-03-24T02:29:00.000Z	Gasseus	escott	I tried, its busybox, and fdisk isn't available.
2012-03-24T02:31:00.000Z	escott	Gasseus	im not too familiar with the debian installer so you might (a) verify the md5sum (b) try a cli rescue cd to verify the hardware is operating correctly
