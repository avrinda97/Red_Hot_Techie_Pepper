2009-07-28T05:17:00.000Z	lillis	ZOMBE	List your problem instead of just asking
2009-07-28T05:23:00.000Z	lillis	ZOMBE	type ls -l
2009-07-28T05:24:00.000Z	lillis	ZOMBE	what string of letters is it? (like -rwx-----) or something like that
2009-07-28T05:25:00.000Z	lillis	ZOMBE	don't forget the sh before
2009-07-28T05:26:00.000Z	lillis	ZOMBE	running something as root requires typing "sudo" before and giving it your password
2009-07-28T05:26:00.000Z	lillis	ZOMBE	like "sudo sh NVIDIA bla bla" and then enter your password
2009-07-28T05:28:00.000Z	lillis	ZOMBE	to install those drivers you need to not be using the graphical interface
2009-07-28T05:28:00.000Z	lillis	ZOMBE	so you'll have to type "sudo killall xorg" to kill the graphics user interface (i.e. the desktop)
2009-07-28T05:28:00.000Z	lillis	ZOMBE	that will launch you back to a black and white text screen, there run the same thing
2009-07-28T05:28:00.000Z	lillis	ZOMBE	sudo sh NVIDIA-etc-etc
2009-07-28T05:29:00.000Z	lillis	ZOMBE	hit ctrl+alt+F2 to come to the console (black and white text screen), login there and do sudo killall xorg
2009-07-28T05:29:00.000Z	lillis	ZOMBE	and then the sudo sh NVIDIA--
2009-07-28T05:31:00.000Z	lillis	ZOMBE	try killall Xorg
2009-07-28T05:32:00.000Z	lillis	ZOMBE	see what jdu wrote
2009-07-28T05:33:00.000Z	lillis	ZOMBE	I'm impressed, most new Linux users would've given up by now and reinstalled XP :)
