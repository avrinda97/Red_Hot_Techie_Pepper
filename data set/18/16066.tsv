2004-12-12T12:02:00.000Z	jonex		How do I decrease the speed of the mouse?
2004-12-12T12:02:00.000Z	Treenaks	jonex	in the "mouse" configuration window
2004-12-12T12:03:00.000Z	jonex	Treenaks	There is no "speed" slider. There are an acceleration slider ans a sensitivity slider.
2004-12-12T12:03:00.000Z	Treenaks	jonex	try the acceleration one
2004-12-12T12:05:00.000Z	jonex	Treenaks	Hmm, ok, but how do I turn off the thing that makes the mouse change speed depending on how fast I move the mouse?
2004-12-12T12:05:00.000Z	Treenaks	jonex	that's called acceleration :)
2004-12-12T12:05:00.000Z	jonex	Treenaks	Yeah, how do I turn it off?
2004-12-12T12:06:00.000Z	Treenaks	jonex	put the sensitivity high, and acceleration low?
2004-12-12T12:07:00.000Z	jonex	Treenaks	When I put the acceleration low, the pointer barely moves. :/
2004-12-12T12:07:00.000Z	Treenaks	jonex	you wanted it to be slower..
2004-12-12T12:07:00.000Z	Treenaks	jonex	move it up a bit, it'll be a bit faster
2004-12-12T12:08:00.000Z	jonex	Treenaks	Well I want it to go in a normal speed but /without/ acceleration.
2004-12-12T12:08:00.000Z	Treenaks	jonex	put only the sensitivity very high
2004-12-12T12:10:00.000Z	jonex	Treenaks	hmm, although it changes the bhaviour some, none of those positions help :/
2004-12-12T12:11:00.000Z	Treenaks	jonex	play with it a bit..
2004-12-12T12:11:00.000Z	jonex	Treenaks	Aren't there just a switch for it somewhere, all other os:es I've used have had one :/
2004-12-12T12:11:00.000Z	Treenaks	jonex	I don't know if there is a switch in X
2004-12-12T12:12:00.000Z	jonex	Treenaks	Hmm, in KDE it was possible IIRC.
