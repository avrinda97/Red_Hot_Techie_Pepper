2009-10-10T16:11:00.000Z	denmark		:))moonykit u can use wvdial
2009-10-10T16:11:00.000Z	mo0nykit	denmark	is wvdial installed by default?
2009-10-10T16:12:00.000Z	denmark		yes
2009-10-10T16:12:00.000Z	denmark		sudo wvdial
2009-10-10T16:13:00.000Z	mo0nykit	denmark	actually I have already sent him the files, then told him to "sudo dpkg -i gnome-ppp-<version number blah>" from /var/cache/apt/archives, he says wvdial is not installed
2009-10-10T16:14:00.000Z	denmark	mo0nykit	install it - sudo apt-get install wvdial
2009-10-10T16:14:00.000Z	mo0nykit	denmark	BTW me doing a "sudo apt-get install gnome-ppp --download-only" will also download the wvdial package, so that means that the wvdial.deb is already in the PPP.tar that I sent my friend
2009-10-10T16:15:00.000Z	denmark	mo0nykit	what actully u want to do ?
2009-10-10T16:15:00.000Z	mo0nykit	denmark	so, you mean, after my friend copies the .deb files to /var/cache/apt/archives, he can "sudo apt-get install wvdial" from anywhere? (He doesn't have Internet connection from within Linux)
2009-10-10T16:16:00.000Z	denmark		dear mo0nykit do not download it
2009-10-10T16:16:00.000Z	mo0nykit	denmark	I want to help my friend install PPP tools. He doesn't have internet connection from Linux. He has a USB modem (HSDPA/GPRS)
2009-10-10T16:17:00.000Z	mo0nykit	denmark	I was thinking along the lines of giving my friend the .debs which I can send as email, then he can download from within Windows, then transfer the files through USB flash drive to his Linux box
2009-10-10T16:17:00.000Z	denmark	mo0nykit	sudo apt-get install wvdial  just use this
2009-10-10T16:18:00.000Z	denmark		then your friend  connect via gprs a
2009-10-10T16:18:00.000Z	denmark		don't download any thing just use this command
2009-10-10T16:21:00.000Z	denmark	mo0nykit	after installing wvdial edit /etc/wvdial.conf file
2009-10-10T16:28:00.000Z	mo0nykit	denmark	it's my friend who has the problem :) He can't "sudo apt-get install" because he doesn't have Internet connection from within Linux
2009-10-10T16:29:00.000Z	mo0nykit	denmark	or do you mean he can "sudo apt-get install wvdial" because he already has the necessary debs in /var/cache/apt/archives ?
