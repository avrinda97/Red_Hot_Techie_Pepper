2012-10-26T01:14:00.000Z	SplasHX11		I got vnc4serve almost working with unity, but mouse clicks in the upper bar with network icon, shutdown button, ... don't work. I can click, but the windows are only shown until i release the mouse button. any idea what's wrong?
2012-10-26T01:16:00.000Z	Kyle__	SplasHX11	How are you running vnc server?  Just from a command line?
2012-10-26T01:16:00.000Z	SplasHX11	Kyle__	Yes, i start the server over ssh
2012-10-26T01:17:00.000Z	Kyle__	SplasHX11	What are you running in your .vnc/xinitrc?
2012-10-26T01:21:00.000Z	SplasHX11	Kyle__	i tried this http://kb.realvnc.com/questions/196/VNC+Server+in+Virtual+Mode+does+not+start+correctly+on+Ubuntu+12.04  and this http://pastebin.com/W2qYUJqM  With both I have the same behaviour
2012-10-26T01:24:00.000Z	Kyle__	SplasHX11	OK.  That's the default, other than forcing the session to be unity-2d. Have you only tried vnc4server?  My guess is unity is using X features that aren't in the antique we know and love as vncserver.  Tigervnc (you have to download a tarball, no ppa I think), works well from 12.04 for me.  Also tightvnc should be more updated than vncserver or vnc4server.
2012-10-26T01:28:00.000Z	SplasHX11	Kyle__	I also tried x11vnc, but the problem is that I don't know how to change the display resolution without monitor connected, so that I get a higher resolution than 1024x768.
2012-10-26T01:30:00.000Z	Kyle__	SplasHX11	Did you do the thing where you put a file/script in /etc/init/ to launc x11vnc automagically for you?
2012-10-26T01:33:00.000Z	Kyle__	SplasHX11	THat should have done it... what happened?
2012-10-26T01:33:00.000Z	Kyle__	SplasHX11	Of course keep in mind that will die when lightdm dies, which is each time you log out.
2012-10-26T01:38:00.000Z	SplasHX11	Kyle__	it works good, but the resolution is set to 1024x768 and I don't know how to change it to a higer resolution withotu monitor connected. The "-gemoetry" option of x11vnc only scales the output.
2012-10-26T01:38:00.000Z	Kyle__	SplasHX11	That's because it's the geometry of the running X.  YOu need to change X to be the resolution you want.
2012-10-26T01:42:00.000Z	SplasHX11	Kyle__	I know that, but I don't know how I can set the resolution of x.
2012-10-26T01:43:00.000Z	Kyle__	SplasHX11	Course you can.  Fragment xorg.conf (or full xorg.conf), and specify it.  Supposedly you can change it on the fly with xrandr.
2012-10-26T01:45:00.000Z	SplasHX11	Kyle__	I tried it with xrandr but only got "cannot finde mode..."
2012-10-26T01:45:00.000Z	Kyle__	SplasHX11	What did xrandr with no options tell you?
2012-10-26T01:46:00.000Z	SplasHX11	Kyle__	"Can't open display"
2012-10-26T01:47:00.000Z	Kyle__	SplasHX11	I think it needs to be run from the running X session.
