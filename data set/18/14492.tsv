2005-07-21T09:44:00.000Z	damon		Cooner: I think it would be uber-complicated, you'd need to change your MBR and set up a linux loader like Grub
2005-07-21T09:44:00.000Z	damon		tuxJR: In synaptic, install the kubuntu-desktop package
2005-07-21T09:46:00.000Z	damon		tuxJR: then in the login screen choose sessions and choose KDE

2005-07-21T09:51:00.000Z	damon		Cooner: don't extract it. Burn it directly to a CD using a ISO burning program (google it)
2005-07-21T09:51:00.000Z	Cooner750	damon	Is it possible to boot the LiveCD ISO from a HD? I know how to burn the ISO, etc...
2005-07-21T09:52:00.000Z	Cooner750	damon	I know how to burn a ISO. I wanted to be able to put the ISO contents on a seperate partiton and edit windows boot.ini to also point to whatever file starts the LiveCD.
2005-07-21T09:59:00.000Z	Cooner750	damon	I mustve read somewhere (mustve be wrong) that there was a ubuntu.ini file or something that windows bootloader could be pointed to to start ubuntu
2005-07-21T10:00:00.000Z	Cooner750	damon	I wish it was that easy :)
2005-07-21T10:01:00.000Z	Cooner750	damon	waiting for firefox to start (windows is slow today)
2005-07-21T10:02:00.000Z	Cooner750	damon	where can I get ahold of Lilo?
2005-07-21T10:19:00.000Z	Cooner750	damon	just to say; my setup on this box is: 1 internal 120GB NTFS w/ windows xp. 1 external Maxtor 120GB w/ 2 partitons. 1 100-something FAT32 partition and one 2GB FAT32 partition
2005-07-21T10:22:00.000Z	damon	Cooner750	good luck, I've got to go. If nothing else seems to work, consider installing one of the boot managers (like SBM, GAG, etc) on your master boot record. That will let you boot from any partition of any HD on your machine
