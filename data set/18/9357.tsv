2007-09-23T05:23:00.000Z	|seb|		what is /lib/firmware for? i've never seen that
2007-09-23T05:23:00.000Z	bulmer	|seb|	look inside it and see if you can recognize the files
2007-09-23T05:24:00.000Z	|seb|	bulmer	they don't look like /lib/modules stuff.....how make /lib/firmware subdir for my new custom kernel?
2007-09-23T05:24:00.000Z	|seb|	bulmer	thanks btw
2007-09-23T05:25:00.000Z	bulmer	|seb|	they're for wireless drivers
2007-09-23T05:26:00.000Z	|seb|	bulmer	why do they need their own directory? no other hardware device needed that
2007-09-23T05:27:00.000Z	bulmer	|seb|	i dont know, but others have their own directories..depends on the distro
2007-09-23T05:27:00.000Z	bulmer	|seb|	why does it matter ?
2007-09-23T05:28:00.000Z	|seb|	bulmer	i couldn't boot into custom kernel
2007-09-23T05:28:00.000Z	|seb|	bulmer	now i know i can just create a symlink to old subdir
2007-09-23T05:28:00.000Z	|seb|	bulmer	thanks for the help...i'm happy now
2007-09-23T05:28:00.000Z	bulmer	|seb|	because you cant boot to the new kernel, you thinks its because of /lib/firmware?
2007-09-23T05:29:00.000Z	|seb|	bulmer	yes
2007-09-23T05:29:00.000Z	|seb|	bulmer	actually,,,,the error came up when i tried to create initrd
2007-09-23T05:29:00.000Z	bulmer	|seb|	its not dependent on that
2007-09-23T05:30:00.000Z	bulmer	|seb|	well maybe if you had added wireless support for the kernel..it requires that dir
2007-09-23T05:31:00.000Z	|seb|	bulmer	yea i did
2007-09-23T05:32:00.000Z	|seb|	bulmer	ok...initrd works now with symlink..will reboot now to try .....thanks again for all info
