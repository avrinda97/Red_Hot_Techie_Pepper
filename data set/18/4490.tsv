2009-04-03T11:55:00.000Z	nhasian	timboy_	i used to upgrade my nvidia drivers manually in 8.04 it was a pain in the butt.  every time a new kernel would come out i would have to reconfigure he nvidia driver.
2009-04-03T11:56:00.000Z	timboy_	nhasian	yeah well i have to have vdapu support. it should be smoother than this for sure...
2009-04-03T11:56:00.000Z	nhasian		what's vdapu?
2009-04-03T11:57:00.000Z	nhasian		i did an apt-cache search and didnt find any vdapu either :)
2009-04-03T11:57:00.000Z	timboy_	nhasian	awesome HD video support from nvidia cards
2009-04-03T11:58:00.000Z	nhasian		wait i'm confused... doesnt my nvidia card already play HD video with the restricted drivers?
2009-04-03T12:02:00.000Z	timboy_	nhasian	sorry vdpau: http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&item=nvidia_vdpau&num=1
2009-04-03T12:03:00.000Z	timboy_		I just updated my intrepid drivers to the latest nvidia now they're not loading properly... Here is xorg.conf: http://pastebin.ca/1380648 here is the end of Xorg.0.log: http://pastebin.ca/1380661
2009-04-03T12:04:00.000Z	nhasian	timboy_	ah thats cool.  so it makes the GPU do more of the processing when playing video than the CPU.
2009-04-03T12:07:00.000Z	timboy_	nhasian	I have an xbmc ubuntu box and I wanted to get the newest driver to take advantage of the new tech. but ubuntu and upgraded nvidia drivers have never mixed well for me... probably because I'm shaking and not stirring...
2009-04-03T12:08:00.000Z	nhasian	timboy_	did you follow starcannon's guide to upgrading nvidia drivers?
2009-04-03T12:08:00.000Z	timboy_	nhasian	no but i'm googling right now
2009-04-03T12:09:00.000Z	nhasian	timboy_	i read it in the ubuntu forums a long time ago.  lemme see if i still have it bookmarked
2009-04-03T12:09:00.000Z	timboy_	nhasian	ok thx
2009-04-03T12:10:00.000Z	nhasian	timboy_	here it is: http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=5086971&postcount=6
2009-04-03T12:10:00.000Z	timboy_		thx
2009-04-03T12:11:00.000Z	nhasian	timboy_	the only tricky thing is to remember to mark the nvidia file executable with +x and to go to another terminal (CTL-ALT-F1) so you can shutdown the gdm
2009-04-03T12:11:00.000Z	timboy_	nhasian	yea that's what I did the first time
