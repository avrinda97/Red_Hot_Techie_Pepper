2012-02-24T15:21:00.000Z	amt0101		No one knows how to run a program after it was installed with wine under unity...ubuntu 11.10?
2012-02-24T15:22:00.000Z	mi3	amt0101	make the file executable from the properties option then run it from wine
2012-02-24T15:22:00.000Z	amt0101	mi3	 it's already installed :)
2012-02-24T15:25:00.000Z	mi3	amt0101	what happened
2012-02-24T15:27:00.000Z	mi3	amt0101	which application are you trying to run in wine?
2012-02-24T15:27:00.000Z	amt0101	mi3	 Internet explorer 8
2012-02-24T15:29:00.000Z	amt0101	mi3	 Wow, how nice:)
2012-02-24T15:30:00.000Z	mi3	amt0101	and just a piece of advice dont use internet explorer you will need to do tons of settings use firefox, opera or google chrome these 3 are most popular atleast for ubuntu
2012-02-24T15:34:00.000Z	amt0101	mi3	 Trust me on this. I have a website that only works on ie. What am I supposed to use?:)
2012-02-24T15:34:00.000Z	amt0101	mi3	 wine 1,3 branch
2012-02-24T15:35:00.000Z	mi3	amt0101	use virtualbox on ur system, install your favourite windows os, and get started
2012-02-24T15:35:00.000Z	amt0101	mi3	 haha I forgot about this one. Thanks:)
2012-02-24T15:37:00.000Z	mi3	amt0101	you use wine 1.3 branch? you use the unstable one right?
2012-02-24T15:37:00.000Z	amt0101	mi3	 Yes
2012-02-24T15:38:00.000Z	mi3	amt0101	can you suggest which windows programs have you currently tested on YOUR system and which worked better?
2012-02-24T15:39:00.000Z	amt0101	mi3	 I haven't tested nothing.
2012-02-24T15:40:00.000Z	mi3	amt0101	ok
2012-02-24T15:40:00.000Z	amt0101	mi3	 But unfortunately I need IE for running a website, which is stupid but again I need it.
