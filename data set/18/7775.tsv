2008-02-10T17:26:00.000Z	Arelis		Hi all. I'm trying to recover my bootloader that Ubuntu installed, but i have two harddrives on my computer. How do i know which harddrive the MBR is on?
2008-02-10T17:26:00.000Z	Seveas	Arelis	it's on the first one
2008-02-10T17:27:00.000Z	Arelis	Seveas	It's more complicated than that: Before i had two HD's, the Ubuntu one was the first one. That had the bootloader on it. My dad added the Windows disk to my PC, and made it the master drive. So now i'm confused.
2008-02-10T17:29:00.000Z	Arelis	Seveas	so what do i do?
2008-02-10T17:29:00.000Z	Seveas	Arelis	check in the bios which one you boot from
2008-02-10T17:29:00.000Z	Arelis	Seveas	the first one.
2008-02-10T17:30:00.000Z	Seveas	Arelis	so my first answer applies :)
2008-02-10T17:30:00.000Z	Arelis	Seveas	is it safe to overwrite that bootloader?
2008-02-10T17:30:00.000Z	Seveas	Arelis	as safe as it is when installing ubuntu
2008-02-10T17:31:00.000Z	Arelis	Seveas	but the bootloader is on the first disk, which is the one dad forbids me to change.
2008-02-10T17:31:00.000Z	Arelis	Seveas	will switching boot order work?
2008-02-10T17:32:00.000Z	Seveas	Arelis	it could
2008-02-10T17:32:00.000Z	Arelis	Seveas	I'll try. I'll be back if it goes wrong :)
2008-04-17T22:23:00.000Z	Seveas	Arelis	switch off compiz
2008-04-17T22:24:00.000Z	Arelis	Seveas	compiz is not on
2008-04-24T23:50:00.000Z	Seveas	Arelis	it should, or at least mostly should
2008-04-24T23:52:00.000Z	Arelis	Seveas	It doesn't. It doesn't do a thing when i wave my pen over it or click with it. How do i enable it? (I installed the wacom-tools package, but haven't rebooted yet - did a modprobe wacom though, but still no /dev/input/wacom)
2008-04-24T23:54:00.000Z	Arelis	Seveas	If you read my previous message, do you know how to get it to work?
