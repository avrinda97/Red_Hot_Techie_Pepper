2009-07-07T01:38:00.000Z	hipitihop		I have a machine which goes to dark screen after a given user logs in but can't see errors. I can ssh in. What log do I need to see what is wrong ?
2009-07-07T01:39:00.000Z	Ktron	hipitihop	dark for every user, or one user?
2009-07-07T01:40:00.000Z	hipitihop	Ktron	that's a little involved but I think in short, just the one
2009-07-07T01:41:00.000Z	Ktron	hipitihop	if its just the one, I'd look in that users home directory (verify they have one) for files like .xinitrc and see if they have something bizarre configured
2009-07-07T01:47:00.000Z	hipitihop	Ktron	looking into it.
2009-07-07T02:01:00.000Z	hipitihop	Ktron	ok have access to the users home drive. where is .xinitrc
2009-07-07T02:01:00.000Z	Ktron	hipitihop	it'd be in their home directory
2009-07-07T02:02:00.000Z	Ktron	hipitihop	it might not be there
2009-07-07T02:02:00.000Z	hipitihop	Ktron	not there.
2009-07-07T02:02:00.000Z	Ktron	hipitihop	hm, if its only for this one user, than it must be some configuration setting of this user
2009-07-07T02:03:00.000Z	Ktron	hipitihop	so its got to be one of the files in there... are you using Gnome?
2009-07-07T02:03:00.000Z	hipitihop	Ktron	yes, standard Ubuntu Jaunty
2009-07-07T02:04:00.000Z	hipitihop	Ktron	and I agree it is probably some setting as this user worked fine before.
2009-07-07T02:04:00.000Z	Ktron	hipitihop	do they have any weird files/directories in their home dir that start with .x?
2009-07-07T02:05:00.000Z	Ktron	hipitihop	or .X?
2009-07-07T02:06:00.000Z	hipitihop	Ktron	.xmoto
2009-07-07T02:16:00.000Z	hipitihop	Ktron	no other ideas ? I'm wondering about in the home dir but nothing stands out
2009-07-07T02:30:00.000Z	hipitihop	Ktron	 thanks for trying, giving up for now, time to do some work
