2008-09-04T02:33:00.000Z	Dustan		I tried installing with ubuiqity..
2008-09-04T02:34:00.000Z	Dustan		my issue was this pc was soooo old it couldent boot off cd
2008-09-04T02:35:00.000Z	Dustan		let me see what I get with the alt install cd
2008-09-04T02:35:00.000Z	Dustan		I have nothing to write to a floppy with
2008-09-04T02:35:00.000Z	Dustan		surf the web
2008-09-04T02:37:00.000Z	Dustan		I had another prompt using the alt cd
2008-09-04T02:37:00.000Z	Dustan		the system was running win98 decently
2008-09-04T02:37:00.000Z	ehtom	Dustan	oh... if you got to a prompt then it does support CD boot :P
2008-09-04T02:33:00.000Z	ehtom	Dustan	can't you use the alternate install CD
2008-09-04T02:34:00.000Z	ehtom	Dustan	or the ubuntu-server install CD?
2008-09-04T02:35:00.000Z	ehtom	Dustan	maybe a lower weight linux distro would be a better idea?
2008-09-04T02:35:00.000Z	ehtom	Dustan	what do you want to do with this system?
2008-09-04T02:36:00.000Z	ehtom	Dustan	that could be a problem
2008-09-04T02:36:00.000Z	ehtom	Dustan	if it doesn't support CD boot, and you can't use floppy boot, you're kinda screwed
2008-09-04T02:36:00.000Z	ehtom	Dustan	if the computer is that old, it won't run a new desktop like ubuntu properly
