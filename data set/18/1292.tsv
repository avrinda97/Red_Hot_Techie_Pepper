2011-04-05T10:57:00.000Z	Jameo		Is there anyway to fix the suspend issue on ubuntu 10.10
2011-04-05T10:57:00.000Z	Jameo		?
2011-04-05T10:57:00.000Z	ayecee	Jameo	yes
2011-04-05T10:59:00.000Z	ayecee	Jameo	determine the cause of the problem, and write a patch that resolves the problem.
2011-04-05T10:59:00.000Z	ayecee	Jameo	honestly, I don't know which problem you're talking about.
2011-04-05T11:01:00.000Z	Jameo	ayecee	do you know any solutions?
2011-04-05T11:01:00.000Z	ayecee	Jameo	I know several solutions, but they may not apply to the problems you have.
2011-04-05T11:01:00.000Z	ayecee	Jameo	describe your problem.
2011-04-05T11:03:00.000Z	ayecee	Jameo	that would be difficult to troubleshoot. I don't have any immediate solutions.
2011-04-05T11:04:00.000Z	ayecee	Jameo	maybe? I hope the forum topic went into more detail.
2011-04-05T11:05:00.000Z	Jameo	ayecee	yes it is but problem is that alot of solution working for different people .... not a single solution is guaranteed
2011-04-05T11:05:00.000Z	ayecee	Jameo	that could be because the problem depends on which hardware is in use.
2011-04-05T11:05:00.000Z	Jameo	ayecee	is there a way I can retain all of programs and settings and revert back to 10.04
2011-04-05T11:06:00.000Z	ayecee	Jameo	not reliably, but you could copy a backup of your home directory to a fresh install of 10.04
2011-04-05T11:06:00.000Z	ayecee	Jameo	what about them?
2011-04-05T11:08:00.000Z	ayecee	Jameo	that would be difficult to do. I think you could get dpkg to tell you about its selections, but I don't know how to apply those to a previous version, or even if it would work.
2011-04-05T11:09:00.000Z	Jameo	ayecee	ohk thanks for the help . I will try the different solutions then trail and error before reverting back
2011-04-05T11:09:00.000Z	ayecee	Jameo	good luck!
