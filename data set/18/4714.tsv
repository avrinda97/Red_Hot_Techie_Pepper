2010-10-20T03:44:00.000Z	bryhoyt	ikonia	but there's still some scripts in /etc/init.d
2010-10-20T03:45:00.000Z	ikonia	bryhoyt	if you look they are called by upstart
2010-10-20T03:45:00.000Z	bryhoyt	ikonia	ok, I see what you mean. Does 10.10 have some scripts like that in /etc/init.d too (I haven't installed it yet)?
2010-10-20T03:46:00.000Z	ikonia	bryhoyt	I think there are a few, but not many at all
2010-10-21T02:45:00.000Z	bryhoyt	ikonia	if ati isn't working on Ubuntu, that's a bug that has something to do with Ubuntu
2010-12-17T03:44:00.000Z	ikonia	bryhoyt	what od you want us to do about it ?
2010-12-17T03:45:00.000Z	ikonia	bryhoyt	what do you want us to actually do about it ?
2010-12-17T03:45:00.000Z	ikonia	bryhoyt	you can't, that 8.10 is dead
2010-12-17T03:46:00.000Z	bryhoyt	ikonia	I know. But our mailserver's down, and I was hoping someone could give me a quick fix
2010-12-17T03:46:00.000Z	ikonia	bryhoyt	there isn't one
2010-12-17T03:46:00.000Z	ikonia	bryhoyt	8.10 is dead, so there is no where to get an update from
2010-12-17T03:47:00.000Z	ikonia	bryhoyt	don't use non-lts distros for production servers, that's the answer
2010-12-17T03:47:00.000Z	ikonia	bryhoyt	I wouldn't put compilers and development headers on an internet facing mail server, that's lesson 02
2010-12-17T03:47:00.000Z	bryhoyt	ikonia	good point
2010-12-17T03:50:00.000Z	bryhoyt	ikonia	do you know anything about that vulnerability? For a quick fix, for 1 week, (until we have a chance to upgrade to an LTS and fix some root problems), would removing gcc be safe enough?
2010-12-17T03:50:00.000Z	ikonia	bryhoyt	up to you, I wouldn't do it
2010-12-17T03:52:00.000Z	bryhoyt	ikonia	neither :-) except the alternative isn't much better (we can't quite live without our mailserver at the moment). So I'm trying to get a feel for what level of risk I'd be taking
2010-12-17T03:52:00.000Z	bryhoyt	ikonia	but point taken, thanks
