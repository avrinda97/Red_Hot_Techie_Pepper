2008-05-05T17:16:00.000Z	fabian__		hey
2008-05-05T17:17:00.000Z	fabian__		i cannot change anything on my external hdd
2008-05-05T17:17:00.000Z	fabian__		i had to mount it manually, since it is not displayed in "media"
2008-05-05T17:17:00.000Z	fabian__		the bash asked for root-privileges
2008-05-05T17:17:00.000Z	fabian__		to mount
2008-05-05T17:17:00.000Z	Dr_willis	fabian__	 depening on the filesystem you must use the proper mount options
2008-05-05T17:22:00.000Z	fabian__	Dr_willis	why do the hdd-icons not appear anymore on my desktop?
2008-05-05T17:22:00.000Z	Dr_willis	fabian__	 which desktop?
2008-05-05T17:22:00.000Z	Dr_willis	fabian__	  could be some bug in the auto mounting stuff.   I never use desktop icons. :)
2008-05-05T17:22:00.000Z	Dr_willis	fabian__	 or theres  some gnome settings also for that.
2008-05-05T17:23:00.000Z	fabian__	Dr_willis	yes, but i also cannot open the media-folder in dolphin
2008-05-05T17:23:00.000Z	fabian__	Dr_willis	it says "folder loading 0%" or something like that
2008-05-05T17:23:00.000Z	Dr_willis	fabian__	 sounds like a bug. try the terminal, see whats in /media
2008-05-05T17:24:00.000Z	fabian__	Dr_willis	via bash it works
2008-05-05T17:24:00.000Z	fabian__	Dr_willis	there are these standard-things like cdrom and cdrom0 and some hidden items
2008-05-05T17:25:00.000Z	Dr_willis	fabian__	 try konqueror - see if it has similer issue. You could always just enter /media/ in the dolphin address bar/path
2008-05-05T17:26:00.000Z	fabian__	Dr_willis	yes, but that does not solve the problem, that other programs cannot acces the drive since the "media:/"-link does not work
2008-05-05T17:26:00.000Z	Dr_willis	fabian__	 'media:/' is not normally used under kubuntu - it caused too many issues.  its best to use  /media/
