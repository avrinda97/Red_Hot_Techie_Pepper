2007-03-18T09:37:00.000Z	clearzen	waxyfresh	I had to setup via drivers for my laptop. I used the drivers from the openchrome project personally but I don't know if they would work for you
2007-03-18T09:37:00.000Z	waxyfresh	clearzen	thanks ill check it out
2007-03-18T09:42:00.000Z	clearzen	waxyfresh	do you know how to compile source? via is supposed to be supported out of the box in ubuntu however if you have problems you will have to build the drivers from source.
2007-03-18T09:45:00.000Z	clearzen	waxyfresh	You need the openchrome drivers
2007-03-18T09:45:00.000Z	clearzen	waxyfresh	I would suggest getting the svn source and building it
2007-03-18T09:46:00.000Z	clearzen	waxyfresh	sudo aptitude install build-essential subversion checkinstall
2007-03-18T09:46:00.000Z	clearzen	waxyfresh	to get started
2007-03-18T09:59:00.000Z	waxyfresh	clearzen	done now what?
2007-03-18T10:00:00.000Z	clearzen	waxyfresh	sudo modprobe <name.of.driver>.ko
2007-03-18T10:00:00.000Z	waxyfresh	clearzen	the name would be via right?
2007-03-18T10:01:00.000Z	clearzen	waxyfresh	I think so it's been a while....if you built it from source it should automaticly install it when you run sudo make install I believe
2007-03-18T10:02:00.000Z	clearzen	waxyfresh	Then all you do is change vesa to via and restart
2007-03-18T10:02:00.000Z	clearzen	waxyfresh	gdm that is
2007-03-18T13:31:00.000Z	clearzen	waxyfresh	speedtest.net will give you a good idea
2007-03-18T13:31:00.000Z	clearzen	waxyfresh	it's a more point and click solution
2007-03-18T13:31:00.000Z	waxyfresh	clearzen	thanks that sounds easyer,im form maine we dont go for that math stuff up here...jk
