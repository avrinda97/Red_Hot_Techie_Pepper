2007-10-20T02:52:00.000Z	neopsyche		Ok! Heres a challenge for everyone! Flash disk says I/O read error when in windows and ubuntu.. when trying to format fat32 using Gparted and using fdisk from command.. running in root also .. Flash disk does not allow deletion of files/ cannot write change to delete file... Cannot copy files to the flash disk main directory.. CAN copy files to the flash disk directory 'downloads' cannot...
2007-10-20T02:52:00.000Z	neopsyche		...delete files from the directory 'downlaods' or the main directory.  Anyone know how to fix this?
2007-10-20T02:53:00.000Z	enyc	neopsyche	are you gettingc kernel errors?  see "dmesg" output
2007-10-20T02:53:00.000Z	enyc	neopsyche	maybe its bad flash media?
2007-10-20T02:53:00.000Z	neopsyche	enyc	I can paste kernel errors in bin.
2007-10-20T02:53:00.000Z	enyc	neopsyche	please do ;-)

2007-10-20T02:55:00.000Z	enyc	neopsyche	okay thats a filesystem error
2007-10-20T02:55:00.000Z	enyc	neopsyche	fat driver is feeling very unhappy
2007-10-20T02:56:00.000Z	enyc	neopsyche	hewever this could of course be caused by underlying media/driver/interface fault or incompatibility
2007-10-20T02:56:00.000Z	enyc	neopsyche	or it could just need a new fat filesystem (mkdosfs -F 32  or whatever)
2007-10-20T02:57:00.000Z	enyc	neopsyche	the filesystem driver is panicing ... so of course you are getting higer-level errors
2007-10-20T02:57:00.000Z	neopsyche	enyc	im getting errors on windows too
2007-10-20T02:57:00.000Z	enyc	neopsyche	yes... if the filesystem is broken ..thats not suprising
2007-10-20T02:57:00.000Z	neopsyche	enyc	filsys definately broke!
2007-10-20T02:57:00.000Z	neopsyche	enyc	ok so i can fix it by typing?
2007-10-20T02:57:00.000Z	enyc	neopsyche	unmount it first
2008-01-01T15:44:00.000Z	enyc	neopsyche	hrrm well look in  http://packages.ubuntu.com/  and see if you can figure out ... Note 6.06=Dapper
