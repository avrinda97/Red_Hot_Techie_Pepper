2005-06-06T12:15:00.000Z	lampshade	yahalom	 Maybe something weird just got corrupted.  If you still can't login, try  a different user.  You can press F3  get to a console, log in there and then create a new user.  Then I would try Gnome again with that user
2005-06-06T12:15:00.000Z	yahalom	lampshade	doesnt work for any user
2005-06-06T12:15:00.000Z	lampshade	yahalom	 yikes

2005-06-06T12:16:00.000Z	lampshade	yahalom	 Even from the console?  By pressing F3 can you log on there?
2005-06-06T12:17:00.000Z	yahalom	lampshade	no
2005-06-06T12:17:00.000Z	lampshade	yahalom	 Well what's it do when you try to logon to the straight console?  ANy errors or anything to go off of?
