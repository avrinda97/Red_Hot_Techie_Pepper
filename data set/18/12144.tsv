2006-05-22T14:05:00.000Z	lobstu		cant surf from it, can't access it from my other pc
2006-05-22T14:05:00.000Z	lobstu		someone help please :(
2006-05-22T14:05:00.000Z	lobstu		so frustrating
2006-05-22T14:06:00.000Z	doctormo	lobstu	please explain
2006-05-22T14:07:00.000Z	lobstu	doctormo	: i have dapper installed, i installed firestarter, set some rules, and started the firewall. firewall is up, but nothing works .. can't ssh in to the box, can't access it's webserver, nor can i surf from the box out
2006-05-22T14:07:00.000Z	doctormo	lobstu	have you checked connection from the box?
2006-05-22T14:08:00.000Z	lobstu	doctormo	: how do i do this?
2006-05-22T14:08:00.000Z	doctormo	lobstu	ping www.google.co.uk
2006-05-22T14:09:00.000Z	doctormo	lobstu	your computer isn't online
2006-05-22T14:09:00.000Z	doctormo	lobstu	then your firewall is droping all packets, make sure you do not have a drop before an accept in the rule chain
2006-05-22T14:10:00.000Z	lobstu	doctormo	: no clue what that means .. i just installed ubuntu for the first time last week .. would assume that default install of dapper + firestarter would at least make sure that the firestarter rules are honoured
2006-05-22T14:10:00.000Z	lobstu	doctormo	: how can i check what you've just spoken about?
2006-05-22T14:10:00.000Z	doctormo	lobstu	they probably are honoured
2006-05-22T14:11:00.000Z	lobstu	doctormo	: may i pm you ?
2006-05-22T14:12:00.000Z	doctormo	lobstu	sudo iptables --list
2006-05-22T14:12:00.000Z	doctormo	lobstu	sure
2006-05-22T14:14:00.000Z	lobstu	doctormo	: are you getting my pm ?
