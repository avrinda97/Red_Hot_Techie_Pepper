2006-11-11T10:36:00.000Z	kitche	dhuv	you probably want ipw2200 since it supports ipw2100 fromw hat I remember
2006-11-11T10:36:00.000Z	dhuv	kitche	really? ok, thats fine, but the problem I am having is that kubuntu wont even boot with the card in the computer
2006-11-11T10:36:00.000Z	kitche	dhuv	errors?
2006-11-11T10:37:00.000Z	dhuv	kitche	during bootup it says "ipw2100 eth1: Failed to start card"

2006-11-11T10:38:00.000Z	dhuv	kitche	but nothing for edgy, I tried irqpoll
2006-11-11T10:41:00.000Z	kitche	dhuv	you said you tried to add irqpoll to your menu.lst?
2006-11-11T10:41:00.000Z	dhuv	kitche	yes
2006-11-11T10:42:00.000Z	kitche	dhuv	did you upgrade or do a full install of edgy
2006-11-11T10:42:00.000Z	dhuv	kitche	full install
2006-11-11T10:43:00.000Z	kitche	dhuv	according to launchpad they need more information about the problem for edgy
2006-11-11T10:44:00.000Z	dhuv	kitche	at the end of the kernel line, I just add irqpoll right?
2006-11-11T10:46:00.000Z	kitche	dhuv	yeah I believe so or you can put it towards the beginning after the kernel
2006-11-11T10:47:00.000Z	dhuv	kitche	this sucks, wireless and sound dont work on this computer after 2 weeks of fiddling on and off
2006-11-11T10:48:00.000Z	kitche	dhuv	sound might work it might be to low sicne I had to adjust my sound higher
2006-11-11T10:48:00.000Z	dhuv	kitche	na, I was talking to the guys in #alsa, we installed the latest version but still nogo
2006-11-11T10:49:00.000Z	kitche	dhuv	my sound I had to raise up since it was to low that you couldn't hear it
2006-11-11T10:50:00.000Z	dhuv	kitche	I went through alsamixer and everything
