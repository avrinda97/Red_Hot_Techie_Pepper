2011-10-15T00:31:00.000Z	fwest		great, lightdm and gdm can no longer let ldap users auth
2011-10-15T00:32:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	fwest	use xdm for that, or even KDM
2011-10-15T00:32:00.000Z	fwest	Stereocaulon	really? you have the same problem too?
2011-10-15T00:33:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	fwest	no, but in my corporate environment using LTSP we use xdm which will query our LDAP servers
2011-10-15T00:33:00.000Z	fwest	Stereocaulon	gdm has worked for years with ldap
2011-10-15T00:34:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	fwest	right, but it seems Canonical has kannabalized it now to remove any advantages to their beta product ldm
2011-10-15T00:34:00.000Z	fwest	Stereocaulon	xdm is not the fix
2011-10-15T00:35:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	fwest	well, we use xdm in our company to login to LDAP. Heck, it even uses Ubuntu 10.04 for it's software repository
2011-10-15T00:36:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	fwest	granted our corporate image is a *heavily* modified Ubuntu 10.04 suitable for ltsp.
2011-10-15T00:37:00.000Z	fwest	Stereocaulon	it is nothing to do with xdm/gdm etc
2011-10-15T00:37:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	fwest	no? Just browse this article here: http://www.junauza.com/2011/05/ubuntu-1110-oneiric-ocelot-features.html
2011-10-15T00:38:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	fwest	pay attention to 2. LightDM replaces GDM
2011-10-15T00:39:00.000Z	fwest	Stereocaulon	its the xsession process that is the issue not the manager
2011-10-15T00:41:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	fwest	I see, but you will still need a suitable hook from the *dm into that xsession that offers the options necessary to login with LDAP
2011-10-15T00:41:00.000Z	fwest	Stereocaulon	hook?
2011-10-15T00:42:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	fwest	well yes, an interface. Nvm.
2011-10-15T00:43:00.000Z	fwest	Stereocaulon	so pam_ldap configured and working isn't good enough eh?
2011-10-15T00:46:00.000Z	Stereocaulon	fwest	nope, if the *dm does not offer an interface to select that option it's not. At the time we were introducing ltsp this was an issue with gdm, so we had to switch to xdm instead. This might be totally outdated right now. I have not done any research on login screens since we introduced ltsp 3 years ago.
