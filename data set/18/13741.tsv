2006-01-17T17:30:00.000Z	nekostar		and do a sudo apt-get update
2006-01-17T17:31:00.000Z	eth42	nekostar	derkdsd, proprietary drivers suck anyway
2006-01-17T17:31:00.000Z	eth42		is there no way to get tv output using the free nv driver?
2006-01-17T17:31:00.000Z	nekostar		eth42,
2006-01-17T17:31:00.000Z	nekostar		nvidia-glx and nvidia-settings work great
2006-01-17T17:32:00.000Z	nekostar		i find they work better than nv drivers
2006-01-17T17:32:00.000Z	eth42	nekostar	but they are closed sorce
2006-01-17T17:32:00.000Z	nekostar	eth42	sure they are
2006-01-17T17:32:00.000Z	nekostar		depends on how nazi u are on open/closed source stuff i suppose
2006-01-17T17:32:00.000Z	nekostar		but you dont have to pay for the driver or anything
