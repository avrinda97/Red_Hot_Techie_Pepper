2007-04-25T11:32:00.000Z	EkToBoT	rogermudd	 so there should be double of everything
2007-04-25T11:26:00.000Z	rogermudd	EkToBoT	sudo gedit /boot/grub.lst (BE VERY CAREFUL - I SUGGEST MAKING A BACKUP FIRST)
2007-04-25T11:26:00.000Z	EkToBoT	rogermudd	thanks
2007-04-25T11:27:00.000Z	EkToBoT	rogermudd	ive do it everytime i install ubuntu it seens to put 2 versions there???
2007-04-25T11:28:00.000Z	rogermudd	EkToBoT	You're old kernels are still there. Just in case (I guess).
2007-04-25T11:28:00.000Z	EkToBoT	rogermudd	thing is they wernt there on the first bootup
2007-04-25T11:29:00.000Z	EkToBoT	rogermudd	 it does it every time even with the new version of ubuntu
2007-04-25T11:30:00.000Z	rogermudd	EkToBoT	Is it creating multiple entries at the GRUB screen or multiple menu.lst files?
2007-04-25T11:30:00.000Z	EkToBoT	rogermudd	 on the grub screen
2007-04-25T11:32:00.000Z	rogermudd	EkToBoT	That's normal. Usually two entries for every kernel (one for safe mode). You can delete the references to them in the menu.lst if you want, but it can be dangerous if you're not careful. Hence my advice to back up first.
2007-04-25T11:33:00.000Z	EkToBoT	rogermudd	it has normal then memtest then repeats
2007-04-25T11:33:00.000Z	EkToBoT	rogermudd	oh well i guess its just a case of editing the boot.ls
2007-04-25T11:33:00.000Z	rogermudd	EkToBoT	are you sure those 'repeats' are not 'old' kernels?
2007-04-25T11:34:00.000Z	EkToBoT	rogermudd	 i did a full format when installing so the chances are slim .... right?
2007-04-25T11:35:00.000Z	EkToBoT	rogermudd	 hmmm well im gonna boot up now and see what the score is aint had any problems editing the boot.ls before just couldnt remember the cmd
2007-04-25T11:35:00.000Z	EkToBoT	rogermudd	thanks for all your help
2007-04-25T11:40:00.000Z	EkToBoT	rogermudd	it worked thanks again
2007-04-25T11:40:00.000Z	rogermudd	EkToBoT	Great! Glad i could help.
