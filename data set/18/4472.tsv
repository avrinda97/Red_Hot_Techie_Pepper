2009-05-21T05:35:00.000Z	Ripzerskins		Hi guys, I need some help.
2009-05-21T05:35:00.000Z	Ripzerskins		My neighbor has a desktop that needs wireless internet, and she's on ubuntu 8.10
2009-05-21T05:37:00.000Z	Ripzerskins		I need to find a wireless networking usb drive that will work with ubuntu 8.10. I don't know where else to look. Any suggestions?
2009-05-21T05:38:00.000Z	Ripzerskins		Thanks everyone.
2009-05-21T05:40:00.000Z	Ripzerskins		The usb network drives on those pages are all either outdate or discontinued. Any other suggestions?

2009-05-21T05:40:00.000Z	Ripzerskins	linuxman410	Thanks.
2009-05-21T05:42:00.000Z	Ripzerskins	linuxman410	I'm seeing reviews on newegg that say this has bad signal reach
2009-05-21T05:43:00.000Z	linuxman410	Ripzerskins	mine works just fine and has a good reach
2009-05-21T05:44:00.000Z	Ripzerskins	linuxman410	Thanks. Going to order one. How do you install it in 8.10? It comes with a cd. I'm curious, ndiswrapper or something?
2009-05-21T05:44:00.000Z	linuxman410		no 8.10 just reconized it
2009-05-21T05:44:00.000Z	linuxman410		i use it in 9.04 now

2009-05-21T05:47:00.000Z	Ripzerskins	linuxman410	haha that's awesome. Well, I'm not paying for it, so I'm not looking for too much of a bargain. Newegg has never sold me a defective product.
