2006-12-31T13:58:00.000Z	fotoflo		i can try lots of things
2006-12-31T13:58:00.000Z	fotoflo		but I want photoshop and word
2006-12-31T13:58:00.000Z	fotoflo		i have both of those and they arent sufficient
2006-12-31T13:59:00.000Z	PirateHead	fotoflo	- not sufficient how?
2006-12-31T14:00:00.000Z	fotoflo	PirateHead	not sufficient because i dont like using them
2006-12-31T14:01:00.000Z	PirateHead	fotoflo	if you want an exact duplicate of the user interface you're probably out of luck
2006-12-31T14:02:00.000Z	fotoflo	PirateHead	thats why i installed wine
2006-12-31T14:02:00.000Z	fotoflo	PirateHead	i want the original
2006-12-31T14:02:00.000Z	fotoflo	PirateHead	i paid good money for it!
2006-12-31T14:03:00.000Z	PirateHead	fotoflo	I don't think wine supports those apps yet. I would love to be corrected, but I think the work is still in progress
2006-12-31T14:03:00.000Z	fotoflo	PirateHead	the cd cost $1.20 at the market!
2006-12-31T14:04:00.000Z	fotoflo	PirateHead	ok thanks
2006-12-31T14:33:00.000Z	PirateHead	fotoflo	hate to say, but this might not be the greatest place to ask that question
2006-12-31T14:33:00.000Z	PirateHead	fotoflo	- you would get the best answer from a post (or an archive search) to a mozilla mailing list
2006-12-31T14:33:00.000Z	fotoflo	PirateHead	ok
2006-12-31T14:34:00.000Z	PirateHead	fotoflo	- somebody has probably come up with a migration kit at some point, it may be unpolished or unfinished but it might give you a start
2006-12-31T14:36:00.000Z	fotoflo	PirateHead	ok, heres a question that i can ask here: ive just mounted a Fat32 partition - how do i make it read/write, and how to i create an alias across partitions?
