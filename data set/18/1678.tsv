2012-11-10T09:24:00.000Z	lonewulf		Hey has anyone tried ubuntustudio
2012-11-10T09:24:00.000Z	lix	lonewulf	long time ago, yes
2012-11-10T09:25:00.000Z	lonewulf	lix	Was it as a professional.
2012-11-10T09:26:00.000Z	lix	lonewulf	that was in the very beginning. we were using it for a students media server (internet radio) for an arts school. - was quite good I have to say
2012-11-10T09:26:00.000Z	lix	lonewulf	would have to check it out again, as this was 8 years ago...
2012-11-10T09:27:00.000Z	lix	lonewulf	actually there was an interesting project in ghana for a radio station that was using ubuntustudio, I remember
2012-11-10T09:27:00.000Z	lonewulf	lix	I was wondering whether or not it would be a good os for everyday use?
2012-11-10T09:27:00.000Z	lix	lonewulf	this certainly depends on what you work. :)
2012-11-10T09:29:00.000Z	lix	lonewulf	meaning: are you into media production?
2012-11-10T09:29:00.000Z	lix	lonewulf	I rememeber we were using jokosher to produce podcasts ans such that time...
2012-11-10T09:30:00.000Z	lonewulf	lix	I dabble a little.
2012-11-10T09:30:00.000Z	lix	lonewulf	I'd say it is definately worth a try
2012-11-10T09:31:00.000Z	lonewulf	lix	Cool I was trying to decide whether or not to install it on my other laptop.
2012-11-10T09:38:00.000Z	lix	lonewulf	is the concerned nickname yours?
2012-11-10T09:39:00.000Z	lix	lonewulf	so use "/ msg nickserv identify **password**"
2012-11-10T09:40:00.000Z	lonewulf	lix	if it was is there a way to recover or change my password throw email?
2012-11-10T09:41:00.000Z	lix	lonewulf	http://blog.mibbit.com/?p=1300
