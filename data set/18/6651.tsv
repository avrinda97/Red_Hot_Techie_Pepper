2008-04-17T18:49:00.000Z	m3333		how do u get a Gnome or KDE enviroment running on Ubuntu Server?
2008-04-17T18:50:00.000Z	bazhang	m3333	just sudo apt-get install ubuntu-desktop or kubuntu-desktop
2008-04-17T18:56:00.000Z	m3333	bazhang	late reply but doesn't that just install an entire ubuntu desktop system?
2008-04-17T18:56:00.000Z	m3333	bazhang	or is it just the GUI enviroment?
2008-04-17T18:56:00.000Z	bazhang	m3333	that would be the full desktop aye
2008-04-17T18:57:00.000Z	m3333	bazhang	is there anyway to keep the server and just install a GUI over top then?
2008-04-17T18:57:00.000Z	bazhang	m3333	sure that will do it
2008-04-17T18:58:00.000Z	m3333	bazhang	but will that install like OpenOffice and all the stuff that comes with the usual desktop os?
2008-04-17T18:59:00.000Z	bazhang	m3333	you want just a gui? does it have to be gnome/kde? there are others as well you know
2008-04-17T19:00:00.000Z	m3333	bazhang	nope just something that means i dont have to interface with the commandline asmuch
2008-04-17T19:01:00.000Z	bazhang	m3333	what ever you install can be removed if it is too bloated you know you might want to try fluxbox or xfce for very lightweight
2008-04-17T19:02:00.000Z	m3333	bazhang	fluxbox or xfce?
2008-04-17T19:02:00.000Z	m3333	bazhang	explain
2008-04-17T19:02:00.000Z	bazhang	m3333	those are both window managers
2008-04-17T19:03:00.000Z	m3333	bazhang	easy to use? and contain a file navigator and a textpad app?
2008-04-17T19:03:00.000Z	bazhang	m3333	xfce much more so; fluxbox requires a bit of fiddling
2008-04-17T19:04:00.000Z	m3333	bazhang	im guesing apt-get install xfce to use xfce?
2008-04-17T19:05:00.000Z	bazhang	m3333	not sure about the very minimum; normally one does xubuntu-desktop but that might be more than you want
