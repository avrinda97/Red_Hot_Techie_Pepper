2008-02-21T09:33:00.000Z	Jouva		I was jut wondering: Is there any GPS and mapping software available for Linux? i.e., something where I could have my laptop with me and a GPS device connected to it and help directions to the driver of a vehicle for whereever we're going
2008-02-21T09:35:00.000Z	usr13	Jouva	gpsdrive
2008-02-21T09:36:00.000Z	usr13	Jouva	gpsman
2008-02-21T09:37:00.000Z	usr13	Jouva	gpsdrive - Car navigation system
2008-02-21T09:40:00.000Z	Jouva	usr13	Yep. That's what it say here ;) I won't be using it yet but I'll keep it in mind. Right now I can only think of 3 applications and one big reason why I can't and stick Linux on my laptop as well.
2008-02-21T09:41:00.000Z	usr13	Jouva	Very good!  Go for it :)
2008-02-21T09:41:00.000Z	Jouva	usr13	That's the problem. I do have it on my desktop, but my laptop I HAVE to keep Windows on.
2008-02-21T09:42:00.000Z	usr13	Jouva	Dual boot. How big is the drive?
2008-02-21T09:43:00.000Z	Jouva	usr13	Not big enough to dual boot really. I do some custom Windows software development for a consulting firm, so I kinda need Windows for that and need the space ;)
2008-02-21T09:43:00.000Z	usr13	Jouva	Get another drive.
2008-02-21T09:43:00.000Z	Jouva	usr13	For the laptop?
2008-02-21T09:44:00.000Z	Jouva	usr13	Oh a bigger one. I see. No. Can't afford it right now and don't have the urge to dual boot for the most part anyway, and would put extra space to Windows' use anyway :/
2008-02-21T09:45:00.000Z	usr13	Jouva	Yes, get a BID drive, ghost your existing MS onto it, leave 20g or so free and then install Ubuntu on it.
2008-02-21T09:45:00.000Z	Jouva	usr13	I'd consider it if I had the money ;)
2008-02-21T09:46:00.000Z	usr13	Jouva	Yea, I know what you mean.  But HDs are getting little cheeper now days, so.... save up and watch for good deal.  Check out the used market, etc.
2008-02-21T09:47:00.000Z	Jouva	usr13	Sorry just that I have a nice big big big credit card debt I need to pay off first :)
2008-02-21T09:47:00.000Z	usr13	Jouva	Yea, esll maybe later on...
2008-02-21T09:48:00.000Z	Jouva	usr13	Oh trust me I'd love to do it :) There's not many games I play these days so I won't have to worry about that for example.
