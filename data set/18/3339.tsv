2009-12-20T22:52:00.000Z	thevishy		sorry for the flood
2009-12-20T22:52:00.000Z	thevishy		is my reading RAM  occupied ?
2009-12-20T22:53:00.000Z	thevishy		how can I adjust this Chogyan
2009-12-20T22:53:00.000Z	Luzido	thevishy	try to see which process occupies ram: start "top" press "M"
2009-12-20T22:53:00.000Z	thevishy		I dont want so much swap - ok but closing will that help ?
2009-12-20T22:54:00.000Z	thevishy		its just FF using 13% and rest are so less
2009-12-20T22:54:00.000Z	thevishy		yes ChogyDan I plan to do that , but still I feel that the problem is that swap is being used too much ?
2009-12-20T22:55:00.000Z	thevishy		The fact is I have a movie open , FF open Xchat opten and a java Program
2009-12-20T22:55:00.000Z	thevishy		not really a 512 MB eater those programs aint it
2009-12-20T22:55:00.000Z	thevishy		so I am wondering why linux even has to swap
2009-12-20T22:55:00.000Z	thevishy		this one is a native Java I think
2009-12-20T22:56:00.000Z	Luzido	thevishy	try to see which process occupies ram: start "top" press "M"
2009-12-20T22:56:00.000Z	thevishy	Luzido	I tried that and it says FF 13% and rest all like 2-10 range ...but all that doesnt amount to 500 MB RAM
