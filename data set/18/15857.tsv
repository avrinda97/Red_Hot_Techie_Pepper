2005-01-18T15:48:00.000Z	no0tic		there's a way to know what installed libs or packets in general are not needed anymore?
2005-01-18T15:48:00.000Z	bob2	no0tic	'deborphan' can help
2005-01-18T15:49:00.000Z	no0tic	bob2	yes, thanks, I now remember it!
2005-01-18T12:53:00.000Z	bob2	no0tic	the hoary kernel already has it, as does mjg59's magic one
2005-01-18T12:55:00.000Z	no0tic	bob2	ok I will wait April
2005-01-18T13:03:00.000Z	bob2	no0tic	you can install either of them on warty
2005-01-18T13:03:00.000Z	no0tic	bob2	tell me how please :) and if I can fall into many problems doing that (hoary kernel onto warty)
