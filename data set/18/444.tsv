2012-02-14T17:32:00.000Z	krivc	Lint	i dont know, my windows machine is Cobra and lubuntu is Rocket
2012-02-14T17:32:00.000Z	Lint	krivc	do you have SMB enabled in the firewall on lubuntu?
2012-02-14T17:33:00.000Z	krivc	Lint	i can be NIS because no computer has name MYNAME on my network
2012-02-14T17:39:00.000Z	krivc	Lint	my iptables is empty, should i add samba there?
2012-02-14T17:45:00.000Z	Lint	krivc	when you opening \\<lubuntu's IP address> from win7, what's happening

2012-02-14T17:51:00.000Z	krivc	Lint	yes it work, i can see my shared files, but why i dont see lubuntu machine in network panel
2012-02-14T18:05:00.000Z	krivc	Lint	can be some problems because i have this line in smb.conf: name resolve order = bcast host wins
2012-02-14T18:05:00.000Z	Lint	krivc	no, because it's client setting, you're a server now
