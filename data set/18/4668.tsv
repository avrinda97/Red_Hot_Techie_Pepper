2010-04-30T17:04:00.000Z	MrGoodkat		nc can connect to port but it doesnt show the ssh it only idles
2010-04-30T17:04:00.000Z	dabaR	MrGoodkat	do you actually have ssh installed on the server?
2010-04-30T17:05:00.000Z	dabaR	MrGoodkat	and you are trying to ssh from the same computer, or another machine?
2010-04-30T17:05:00.000Z	dabaR	MrGoodkat	btw, why port 80 for SSH?
2010-04-30T17:05:00.000Z	dabaR	MrGoodkat	and, do you want only port 80 and not 22?
2010-04-30T17:07:00.000Z	dabaR	MrGoodkat	did you do anything with the config file for the ssh server
2010-04-30T17:07:00.000Z	dabaR	MrGoodkat	that sounds like the logical place for the change
2010-04-30T17:07:00.000Z	dabaR	MrGoodkat	Server: listen on port 22 and port 80
2010-04-30T17:07:00.000Z	dabaR	MrGoodkat	I don't like that solution myself.
2010-04-30T17:08:00.000Z	dabaR	MrGoodkat	I would probably tell the server to listen to ports 22 and 80 instead, like I said earlier :)
2010-04-30T17:09:00.000Z	MrGoodkat	dabaR	can i change it in the config to "Port 22 80" ?
2010-04-30T17:09:00.000Z	dabaR	MrGoodkat	probably. using openssh-server?
2010-04-30T17:10:00.000Z	MrGoodkat	dabaR	i guess so, standard ubuntu server
2010-04-30T17:11:00.000Z	dabaR	MrGoodkat	the file is /etc/ssh/sshd_config You could google to see whether there is an actual tutorial
2010-04-30T17:17:00.000Z	MrGoodkat	dabaR	"netstat -ant" says the its listening on port 80 now, but i still cant open the ssh with putty
2010-04-30T17:19:00.000Z	dabaR	MrGoodkat	and you removed the iptables rule? And made the server listen to port 80, and restarted the server?
2010-04-30T17:22:00.000Z	MrGoodkat	dabaR	, sorry i didnt notice that apache runs already on that port, works now
2010-04-30T17:23:00.000Z	dabaR	MrGoodkat	sweeet
