2007-09-25T09:49:00.000Z	Rageon		Whats the keyboard shortcut to goto login screen please?
2007-09-25T09:49:00.000Z	LjL	Rageon	you normally need to logout in order to go back to the login screen
2007-09-25T09:50:00.000Z	LjL	Rageon	i don't know, i'm on KDE
2007-09-30T08:54:00.000Z	Rageon	LjL	i installed clamav.. but now when i type clamav in terminal nothing happens ?
2007-09-30T08:55:00.000Z	LjL	Rageon	you'd probably like to use a graphical frontend to it.
2007-09-30T09:17:00.000Z	Rageon	LjL	what do i put in the mountpoint option?
2007-09-30T09:17:00.000Z	LjL	Rageon	any directory.
2007-09-30T09:17:00.000Z	LjL	Rageon	just make it one that's empty.
2007-09-30T09:19:00.000Z	LjL	Rageon	those aren't directories. make a directory in your home by typing, say,  mkdir ~/fakecd , and mount it there
2007-09-30T09:21:00.000Z	Rageon	LjL	mount: can't find /home/Rageon/Mount in /etc/fstab or /etc/mtab
2007-09-30T09:24:00.000Z	Rageon	LjL	mount: can't find /home/Rageon/Mount in /etc/fstab or /etc/mtab
2007-09-30T09:28:00.000Z	LjL	Rageon	what's the command you've typed exactly?
2007-09-30T09:31:00.000Z	LjL	Rageon	anyway, i suspect you didn't type the command i gave you, but rather just "mount /home/Rageon/Mount". by the way, you shouldn't have a username with capital letters in it.
2007-09-30T11:01:00.000Z	Rageon	LjL	whats it mean by root partition?
2007-09-30T11:01:00.000Z	LjL	Rageon	the partition you boot from.
2007-09-30T11:06:00.000Z	LjL	Rageon	it's an ISO image compressed with "bzip2". anyway, type "file <filename>" to find out what type a file is.
2008-04-01T18:33:00.000Z	LjL	Rageon	you'll be hard pressed to find a card being sold these days without any 3D capabilities
