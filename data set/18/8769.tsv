2007-07-03T09:45:00.000Z	Sonicadvance1		It seems that whatever I do, I ALWAYS get Grub errors 15,17, or 22
2007-07-03T09:46:00.000Z	Scunizi	Sonicadvance1	reinstall grub with the instructions found at http://users.bigpond.net.au/hermanzone/p15.htm
2007-07-03T09:51:00.000Z	Sonicadvance1	Scunizi	is that article entirely about dual-booting with Windows?
2007-07-03T09:52:00.000Z	Scunizi	Sonicadvance1	no.. it also works for just reinstalling grub.
2007-09-17T08:19:00.000Z	Scunizi	Sonicadvance1	a couple of things.. first I find ipod work better with Amarok than Rythmbox.
2007-09-17T08:20:00.000Z	Scunizi	Sonicadvance1	use nicks when addressing someone so what you say won't get lost in the other noise.
2007-09-17T08:20:00.000Z	Scunizi	Sonicadvance1	what is the problem.?
2007-09-17T08:21:00.000Z	Scunizi	Sonicadvance1	will it read anything?
2007-09-17T08:23:00.000Z	Scunizi	Sonicadvance1	which Ipod is it?  Did you add anything to your fstab?
2007-09-17T08:23:00.000Z	Sonicadvance1	Scunizi	It's the new Ipod Nano
2007-09-17T08:23:00.000Z	Scunizi	Sonicadvance1	Does the instructions say to format it before use?
2007-09-17T08:24:00.000Z	Sonicadvance1	Scunizi	from what I can tell, they don't
2007-09-17T08:25:00.000Z	Scunizi	Sonicadvance1	do you have access to a windows machine?
2007-09-17T08:25:00.000Z	Sonicadvance1	Scunizi	Nope
2007-09-17T08:26:00.000Z	Scunizi	Sonicadvance1	I'd hate to advise you further.. I ended up getting my shuffle working be going to winxp first then back to ubuntu. I also added a line to my fstab.
2007-09-17T08:28:00.000Z	Scunizi	Sonicadvance1	the other thing you could try is to add a directory in /media called ipod before plugging it in. then plug it in and type sudo mount -a
2007-09-17T08:29:00.000Z	Scunizi	Sonicadvance1	the thing is, iTunes will format it and place the appropriate directories on the device.  without knowing what those are or where makes it tough.
2007-09-17T08:30:00.000Z	Scunizi	Sonicadvance1	you can also look at http://ipodlinux.org/Main_Page for more info.
