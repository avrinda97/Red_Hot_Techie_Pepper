2007-12-24T02:56:00.000Z	Shimfs	h4ngedm4n	no problem :)
2007-12-24T02:59:00.000Z	h4ngedm4n	Shimfs	hm i thought bc43xx would be a wireless set tho, and the problem is with the wired?
2007-12-24T03:02:00.000Z	h4ngedm4n	Shimfs	not sure if this was covered already, but you already tried setting dhcp with network manager and it didnt work? did you make sure there weren't multiple network manager windows open?
2007-12-24T03:02:00.000Z	Shimfs	h4ngedm4n	yes i did, and it did not work
2007-12-24T03:02:00.000Z	Shimfs	h4ngedm4n	i am no longer using network-manager, i use wicp right now
2007-12-24T03:02:00.000Z	h4ngedm4n	Shimfs	did not work, as in you didn't even get an ip assigned right
2007-12-24T03:03:00.000Z	Shimfs	h4ngedm4n	exactly
2007-12-24T03:05:00.000Z	h4ngedm4n	Shimfs	i cant see it being a driver problem. what does forcing an ip do?
2007-12-24T03:05:00.000Z	Shimfs	h4ngedm4n	how to do so, and i dont know which ip i should choose, i use dhcp usually
2007-12-24T03:05:00.000Z	h4ngedm4n	Shimfs	well, on your router it has a dhcp range somewhere, just pick an ip not in that range
2007-12-24T03:06:00.000Z	h4ngedm4n	Shimfs	in my case, 192.168.1.15-47 are dhcp, so i just pick 192.168.1.150 or something to test away from dhcp
2007-12-24T03:06:00.000Z	Shimfs	h4ngedm4n	and i dont have access to the router -.- hate it :P
2007-12-24T03:07:00.000Z	h4ngedm4n	Shimfs	well... i guess for temporary purposes, you can brute force ping the local network until you find an ip not being used :)
2007-12-24T03:07:00.000Z	Shimfs	h4ngedm4n	okay -.- :P
2007-12-24T03:07:00.000Z	h4ngedm4n	Shimfs	then when you get that ip, assign it, and see if you can reach the internet
2007-12-24T03:08:00.000Z	Shimfs	h4ngedm4n	okay will do
2007-12-24T03:15:00.000Z	Shimfs	h4ngedm4n	when i try a static ip, what should the submask and gateway eb?
2007-12-24T03:16:00.000Z	h4ngedm4n	Shimfs	for me its 255.255.255.0 / 192.168.1.1, pretty common settings
