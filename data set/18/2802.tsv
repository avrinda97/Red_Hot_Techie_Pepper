2010-03-06T06:22:00.000Z	Blackcamaro8		Where is the file rc.local to be created?
2010-03-06T06:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Blackcamaro8	 its in /etc/ allready made.
2010-03-06T07:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Blackcamaro8	 you set up an ip tunnle with it.
2010-03-06T07:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Blackcamaro8	 err. a 'ssh tunnel'
2010-03-06T07:19:00.000Z	Blackcamaro8	Dr_Willis	could you explain this? Also, would I need to use any special software on the client computer?
2010-03-06T07:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Blackcamaro8	 theres example/docs/guides for it all over the internet. Ive only done it once or twice ages ago
2010-03-06T07:21:00.000Z	Blackcamaro8	Dr_Willis	How would I go about enabling restricted nVidia drivers via command line? The GUI isn't showing any available, and it's a brand new install, so I know it doesn't have them already.
2010-03-06T07:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Blackcamaro8	 you figure out what package name is. and sudo apt-get install it.
2010-03-06T07:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Blackcamaro8	 apt-cache search nvidia
2010-03-06T07:23:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Blackcamaro8	 now what one you need.. Ive no idea
2010-03-06T07:24:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Blackcamaro8	 nvidia-glx-173  *or some other ###*  at the end
2010-03-06T07:25:00.000Z	Blackcamaro8	Dr_Willis	That is the exact number I need, but all that is shown is 'nvidia-173-modaliases' and abunc of other irrelevant packages.
2010-03-06T07:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Blackcamaro8	 gee.. the package list i see includes --> nvidia-glx-173 - NVIDIA binary Xorg driver
2010-03-06T07:26:00.000Z	Blackcamaro8	Dr_Willis	How would I check which drivers are enabled?
2010-03-06T07:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Blackcamaro8	 install them. see if they work.. check xorg log. Ive rarely had any issues at all with  my nvidia systems
2010-03-07T08:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Blackcamaro8	 you have to watch out that the isntaller dosent accidently install grub to the wrong hard drive. I recall some button/advanced option near the end of the install to tell to where to go
2010-03-07T08:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Blackcamaro8	 i tend to just use persistant-save enabled live usb type setups on flash drives.
2010-03-07T08:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Blackcamaro8	 or i set up grub2 to boot the iso files. :)
