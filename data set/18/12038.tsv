2006-07-04T06:52:00.000Z	kordo		system does not have a console
2006-07-04T06:54:00.000Z	kordo		the problem is how to install dc++ client
2006-07-04T06:54:00.000Z	kordo		or codecks for playing avi files
2006-07-04T06:54:00.000Z	kordo		or anything like it in Linux
2006-07-04T06:56:00.000Z	snoops	kordo	there's a few dc clinets to choose from
2006-07-04T06:57:00.000Z	snoops	kordo	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_connect_file-sharing_application#Linux.2FUnix
2006-07-04T07:00:00.000Z	snoops	kordo	no of course not.. just giving you an IDEA of what dc clients are around for linux
2006-07-04T07:02:00.000Z	snoops	kordo	either open synaptic package manager then search for vlc and choose to download it from that or type 'sudo apt-get install vlc' in terminal
2006-07-04T07:05:00.000Z	snoops	kordo	there's a lot more than just 'install vlc' in those guides, if you read them
2006-07-04T07:13:00.000Z	snoops	kordo	there is, but requires patience and getting to understand different ways of doing things.. takes a bit of time, and in my opinion is well worth it in the long run
2006-07-04T07:24:00.000Z	snoops	kordo	people are willing to teach, but you need to be patient and willing to learn new things..
2006-07-04T07:30:00.000Z	snoops	kordo	if you'd like me to private message you on a few of the basics in linux I'd be happy to?
