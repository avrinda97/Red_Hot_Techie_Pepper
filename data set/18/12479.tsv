2006-04-15T10:33:00.000Z	BobC2		Is this the wrong place to ask about a comparison between Ubuntu and Open Suse? (New Linux user on Ubuntu)
2006-04-15T10:34:00.000Z	Skorgu|Work	BobC2	SuSE IIRC is still RPM based. rpm left a bad taste in a lot of people's mouths, but ymmv
2006-04-15T10:35:00.000Z	BobC2	Skorgu|Work	RPM?
2006-04-15T10:35:00.000Z	Skorgu|Work	BobC2	rpm and apt are two package management tools. You'll probably never notice them as a user but if something breaks, rpms are neigh impossible to fix
2006-04-15T10:36:00.000Z	BobC2	Skorgu|Work	getting apps on Ubuntu "just works"
2006-04-15T10:37:00.000Z	BobC2	Skorgu|Work	care to say why...thats really what I'm looking for and I am not experienced
2006-04-15T10:37:00.000Z	Skorgu|Work	BobC2	yeah, its apt underneath the pretty pictures tho. And from my perspective, when I bork something up majorly its way easier to fix than rpm dependency hell. Hopefully you'll never know it exists
2006-04-15T10:38:00.000Z	BobC2	Skorgu|Work	lol sounds awefull
2006-04-15T10:38:00.000Z	BobC2	Skorgu|Work	OK thanks
2006-04-15T10:39:00.000Z	Skorgu|Work	BobC2	I'm hardly unbiased though, I run gentoo for fun and I loathe redhat :)
2006-04-15T10:39:00.000Z	BobC2	Skorgu|Work	oh yes another version I'm heard of
2006-04-15T10:40:00.000Z	BobC2	Skorgu|Work	I'm a real knoob  but I'm so VERY impressed with Ubuntu
2006-04-15T10:40:00.000Z	Skorgu|Work	BobC2	I'm not a n00b at all and _I'm_ impressed with Ubuntu :-D
2006-04-15T10:41:00.000Z	BobC2	Skorgu|Work	nice
2006-04-15T10:41:00.000Z	Skorgu|Work	BobC2	they've done a great job taking the weapons-grade debian power and putting a candy coating on it
2006-04-15T10:41:00.000Z	BobC2	Skorgu|Work	lol Indeed it was a killer for me as Itried over the years
2006-04-15T10:47:00.000Z	Skorgu|Work	BobC2	the pain doesn't happen until you get it all set up and then some well-meaning app changes it all back to defaults.....
2006-04-15T10:47:00.000Z	BobC2	Skorgu|Work	 Yikes!
