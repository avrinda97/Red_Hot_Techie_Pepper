2012-05-02T22:29:00.000Z	ktchk		Hi please help me to install libboost-phthon-1.42 under ubuntu 12.04
2012-05-02T22:30:00.000Z	jrib	ktchk	why do you need 1.42 specifically and not the version in 12.04 repositories/
2012-05-02T22:32:00.000Z	jrib	ktchk	you're positive that libboost-python-dev does not satisfy the requirement?
2012-05-02T22:33:00.000Z	ktchk	jrib	the error message from dpkg
2012-05-02T22:33:00.000Z	jrib	ktchk	where did you get the package from?
2012-05-02T22:35:00.000Z	ktchk	jrib	yes
2012-05-02T22:36:00.000Z	jrib	ktchk	pastebin exactly the error you recieved
2012-05-02T22:36:00.000Z	jrib	ktchk	(and your command)
2012-05-02T22:37:00.000Z	ktchk	jrib	package libboost-python1.40.0 is not installed
2012-05-02T22:37:00.000Z	jrib	ktchk	and what command did you run to get that?
2012-05-02T22:38:00.000Z	ktchk	jrib	after cmak . and make package dpkg -i heekscnc.deb
2012-05-02T22:38:00.000Z	jrib	ktchk	you built the package on 12.04?
2012-05-02T22:38:00.000Z	ktchk	jrib	yes
2012-05-02T22:40:00.000Z	jrib	ktchk	ah, it's specific in CMakeLists.txt.  You should contact the author to see if that specific version of libboost-python is needed (1.40) or if you can use the version available in 12.04
2012-05-02T22:41:00.000Z	ktchk	jrib	is it ok to change the cmakelists.txt?
2012-05-02T22:41:00.000Z	jrib	ktchk	I don't know. This is why I tell you to contact the author :)
2012-05-02T22:41:00.000Z	ktchk	jrib	thanks
2012-05-02T22:56:00.000Z	ktchk	jrib	for info I change the cmakelists.txt and use the libboost-python-1.48 and it install and run with error for gnome menu
