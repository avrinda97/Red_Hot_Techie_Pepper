2010-03-27T03:08:00.000Z	Andy80		I've a (maybe stupid) problem with a "Custom Application Launcher": if I start an application from the terminal doing: ./ts3client_runscript.sh it runs fine. If I create a "Custom Application Launcher" choosing that script, the application is not started and I cannot understand why O_o any idea?
2010-03-27T03:10:00.000Z	Typos_King	Andy80	  is the .sh set to be executable?
2010-03-27T03:10:00.000Z	Typos_King	Andy80	  when executing using the 'dot' .   not sure that's a requirement
2010-03-27T03:11:00.000Z	Andy80	Typos_King	yes, the .sh is set to +x
2010-03-27T03:11:00.000Z	Typos_King	Andy80	  rw-rw-rwx?
2010-03-27T03:12:00.000Z	Typos_King	Andy80	  the last 3 will be the ones that'll allow anyone to execute it
2010-03-27T03:12:00.000Z	Andy80	Typos_King	755 permissions.... the only difference is starting from a terminal or starting from a "Custom Application Launcher"
2010-03-27T03:13:00.000Z	Typos_King	Andy80	  any errors?
2010-03-27T03:13:00.000Z	Typos_King	Andy80	  are you also providing an absolute path or just relative?
2010-03-27T03:13:00.000Z	Andy80	Typos_King	I cannot see anything... neither errors...
2010-03-27T03:14:00.000Z	Andy80	Typos_King	absolute.... but the script contains relative paths
2010-03-27T03:14:00.000Z	Andy80	Typos_King	can I copy-paste the script somewhere?
2010-03-27T03:15:00.000Z	Andy80	Typos_King	http://pastebin.com/7zWF7hKr
2010-03-27T03:17:00.000Z	Typos_King	Andy80	  looks ok.... I run .sh files as well from menus, and they run fine :|
2010-03-27T03:18:00.000Z	Typos_King	Andy80	  may be some setting in the desktop link
2010-03-27T03:19:00.000Z	Andy80	Typos_King	maybe the problem is that it uses some libraries that are in that folder?
2010-03-27T03:20:00.000Z	Typos_King	Andy80	  so long they're found in $PATH, I'd think that'd do
