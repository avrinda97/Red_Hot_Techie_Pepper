2009-08-23T19:39:00.000Z	path1		i run windows vista and i've set up a ubuntu server. i would like to connect to it remotely. should i use VNC or RDP and i've also heard about freeNX
2009-08-23T19:39:00.000Z	path1		whats fastest, what will work under vista, could i use remote desktop with all of these ?
2009-08-23T19:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	path1	rdesktop if you enable remote logon
2009-08-23T19:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	path1	vnc is very heavy and unencrypted
2009-08-23T19:41:00.000Z	path1	ActionParsnip	what is rdesktop? is it rdp? is it faster than the others?
2009-08-23T19:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	path1	it just integrates better as its made by microsoft for their OS
2009-08-23T19:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	path1	rather than some 3rd party app
2009-08-23T19:42:00.000Z	path1	ActionParsnip	i think it comes default with ubuntu installation and i've already used it, but its slow
2009-08-23T19:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	path1	it also uses 128bit encryption so is quite secure wheras vnc isnot
2009-08-23T19:43:00.000Z	path1	ActionParsnip	so what about freeNX?
2009-08-23T19:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	path1	no the default is vnc and yes it is slow
2009-08-23T19:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	path1	why do you need to see a full desktop though? Can you not get web interfaces to your apps?
2009-08-23T19:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	path1	you will have to enable remote login enabled
2009-08-23T19:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	path1	rdp will also lock the local system's display as you only have a single desktop licence on the system
2009-08-23T19:46:00.000Z	path1	ActionParsnip	no problem if the local system will become locked. as long as its a fast and secure way, its good
2009-08-23T19:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	path1	i'd look into more sophistcated ways to interface with the system. oftem the whole desktop is not needed
2009-08-23T19:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	path1	e.g. vlc has a web interface which can be used instead of streaming the entire screen to manage audio playback
2009-08-23T19:51:00.000Z	path1	ActionParsnip	i use a software called "PersonalBrain" and i want to use it from a remote machine, thats why i need the desktop
