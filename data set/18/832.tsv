2012-02-29T23:43:00.000Z	HSarena	theadmin	: Daemon is inhibited
2012-02-29T23:43:00.000Z	theadmin	HSarena	da wut... How are you formatting the disk?
2012-02-29T23:46:00.000Z	HSarena	theadmin	: first time it's show another error then i delete this flash, now i can't format this
2012-02-29T23:46:00.000Z	theadmin	HSarena	How are you formatting it?
2012-02-29T23:47:00.000Z	HSarena	theadmin	: with Disk Utility
2012-02-29T23:48:00.000Z	theadmin	HSarena	Try the cli way: sudo mkfs.FILESYSTEM_TYPE /dev/sdXY (where FILESYSTEM_TYPE is the fs you're formatting to, X is the device letter and Y is the partition number)
2012-02-29T23:57:00.000Z	HSarena	theadmin	thank you, i can format it, but now i can't mount it
2012-02-29T23:58:00.000Z	HSarena	theadmin	Error mounting: mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on /dev/sdc, missing codepage or helper program, or other error In some cases useful info is found in syslog - try  dmesg | tail  or so
2012-02-29T23:58:00.000Z	theadmin	HSarena	Why are you mounting /dev/sdc? Did you format the whole device?
2012-03-01T00:00:00.000Z	HSarena	theadmin	yes, i formatted it
2012-03-01T00:00:00.000Z	theadmin	HSarena	/dev/sdc itself?
2012-03-01T00:00:00.000Z	theadmin	HSarena	That's... wrong -_- Well, it's possible to do it but it's not the right way around
2012-03-01T00:01:00.000Z	theadmin	HSarena	You need to create a partition, format the partition
2012-03-01T00:01:00.000Z	HSarena	theadmin	how?? with Disk Utility???
2012-03-01T00:02:00.000Z	theadmin	HSarena	I don't know how that even works, try gparted
2012-03-01T00:07:00.000Z	HSarena	theadmin	tnx ;)
