2009-06-13T15:42:00.000Z	ikonia	bidossessi	do a sudo apt-get update first
2009-06-13T15:43:00.000Z	bidossessi	ikonia	no deal. update goes without error, but install still fails
2009-06-13T15:43:00.000Z	ikonia	bidossessi	sudo apt-get install php5-cli see if it errors
2009-06-13T15:46:00.000Z	ikonia	bidossessi	please pastebin your /etc/apt/sources.list file
2009-06-13T15:47:00.000Z	bidossessi	ikonia	it seems aptitude is able to offer a solver.  it's working now
