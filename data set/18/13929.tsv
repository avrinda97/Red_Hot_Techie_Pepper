2005-12-15T14:24:00.000Z	lgc		Hello all! I have some very basic (stupid, that is) question about my Gnome configuration: when I minimise a window it vanishes out of sight, and it wasn't so before (I don't know what is what I messed with). Where can I restore the original behaviour of my windows? Thanks.
2005-12-15T14:26:00.000Z	HappyFool	lgc	intiially, you can use Alt-TAB to switch to a minimized app
2005-12-15T14:26:00.000Z	HappyFool	lgc	default ubuntu comes with two 'panels' (bars at the top and bottom of the screen) -- do you still have those ?
2005-12-15T14:28:00.000Z	lgc	HappyFool	yes. I know I can get the minimised window back again with ALT-tab. The problem is that I don't know what windows I have minimised, since they don't  appear in the (lower) panel
2005-12-15T14:29:00.000Z	HappyFool	lgc	try this: right-click on the lower panel, choose 'Add to panel' and look for 'window list'
2005-12-15T14:31:00.000Z	lgc	HappyFool	bingo! It worked! You're a genius! Thanks! Are you in for a more "serious" challenge?
2005-12-15T14:32:00.000Z	HappyFool	lgc	heh. i can try ;)
2005-12-15T14:36:00.000Z	lgc	HappyFool	I remember, before I lost my first Hoary to the auto-update whatever, that there was a nice icon that showed the CPU status of my machine. I can't remember what app it exactly was. Now I have "system monitor", but I have to click on it in order to get the status. Do you happen to know the right app?
2005-12-15T14:37:00.000Z	HappyFool	lgc	what do you mean by status ? percentage 'in use' ?
2005-12-15T14:39:00.000Z	lgc	HappyFool	exactly. The missing app was a dynamic icon, much as the weather one or the CPU speed one. Unlike "system monitor" (at least in its current, seemingly unavoidable configuration)
2005-12-15T14:40:00.000Z	HappyFool	lgc	hmm. looks like the gnome-gods have removed it from the default install
2005-12-15T14:40:00.000Z	HappyFool	lgc	maybe you can find it in the repositories, but i'm not sure
2005-12-15T14:42:00.000Z	lgc	HappyFool	I guess it's part of the basic Hoary install, since it's the only one I know (I'm a bit wary of dist-upgrades, you know). Maybe it's on the original disk. Do you happen to remember its name?
2005-12-15T14:43:00.000Z	HappyFool	lgc	ah, i misunderstood your question. no, i don't know the app, sorry.
2005-12-15T14:46:00.000Z	lgc	HappyFool	never mind. I hope we can meet online sometime later -it's almost 3 a.m. here in Mexico and I need some rest-. Thanks for your help.
2005-12-15T14:47:00.000Z	HappyFool	lgc	cool. sleep well
2005-12-15T14:47:00.000Z	lgc	HappyFool	you bet. Thanks. 'Later. EOT.
2006-03-14T12:40:00.000Z	lgc	HappyFool	you seem to be knowledgeable. Can you help me?
