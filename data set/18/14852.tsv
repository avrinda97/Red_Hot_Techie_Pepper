2005-08-10T09:16:00.000Z	reka		actually, disregard [1] . :)
2005-08-10T09:16:00.000Z	reka		you already answered it
2005-08-10T09:17:00.000Z	rommer	reka	i have starterbar gdesklet which i just drag n dropped the icon from applications->internet in gnome menu to
2005-08-10T09:17:00.000Z	reka	rommer	check what command the starter icon actually calls
2005-08-10T09:19:00.000Z	rommer	reka	firefox %u
2005-08-10T09:19:00.000Z	reka	rommer	remove the %u
2005-08-10T09:19:00.000Z	rommer		yea i tried
2005-08-10T09:19:00.000Z	rommer		ill try again
2005-08-10T09:20:00.000Z	rommer	reka	hmm that seemed to work, b4 when i took the %u away i couldnt even run firefox
2005-08-10T09:21:00.000Z	reka	rommer	righto then.  i can't actually remember what the %u does thouhg. :-/
2005-08-10T09:22:00.000Z	rommer	reka	by the look of it, it was trying to go to the site %u, and if you just type a word in the address bar then push enter it searches google (or whatever search thing you use) and university of minnesota must be the top hit for %u lol
2005-08-10T09:23:00.000Z	reka	rommer	oh, ok then.  at least it wasn't some weird site. :)
2005-08-10T09:23:00.000Z	rommer		yea
2005-08-10T09:24:00.000Z	rommer		anyone know of a mac os x dock app that is better than starterbar?
2005-08-10T09:26:00.000Z	reka	rommer	probably not the best place to ask. :)
2005-08-10T09:27:00.000Z	rommer	reka	nah didnt think so
