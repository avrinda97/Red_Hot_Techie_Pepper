2009-10-26T15:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chrism2671	 that like 2 differen tthings.. If you want to stop gdm from starting? or stop it from auto logging in?
2010-07-13T16:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chrism2671	 local lan? of over the internet?
2010-07-13T16:28:00.000Z	chrism2671	Dr_Willis	local lan
2010-07-13T16:29:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chrism2671	 2 linux machines? or linux + win? or what?
2010-07-13T16:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chrism2671	 freenx works very well for a 'whole' dekktop. vnc works well. but is a little slower. but easier to get going
2010-07-13T16:33:00.000Z	chrism2671	Dr_Willis	I'm certain there's a way to do it without installing anything extra, just over an ssh -X session, or am I wrong about that?
2010-07-13T16:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chrism2671	  the whole desktop apps would all run as seperate apps.. so you sould have windows scattered all over.  try running  gnome-panel and see.
2010-07-13T16:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chrism2671	 using freenx, or vnc would keep them all int heir own 'window' and thus neater
2010-07-13T16:35:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chrism2671	 run 'gnome-session'  over the ssh -X . and hang on to your hat. :)
2010-07-13T16:38:00.000Z	chrism2671	Dr_Willis	oh my goodness i wish you could see what this has done to my desktop!
2010-07-13T16:38:00.000Z	chrism2671	Dr_Willis	It has fused mac + ubuntu in one!
2010-07-13T16:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chrism2671	 i warned you. :)
2010-07-13T16:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chrism2671	 tecnically its just ran a lot of gnome apps...
2010-07-13T16:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chrism2671	 hope nautilus dosent goof things up when it tries to take over the desktop :)
2010-07-13T16:39:00.000Z	chrism2671	Dr_Willis	it's pretty fun to see, if a little crazy!
2010-07-13T16:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	chrism2671	 now ya know why we suggested freenx
2010-07-13T16:40:00.000Z	chrism2671	Dr_Willis	yep makes perfect sense! :-)
