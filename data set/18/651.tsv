2011-11-09T08:37:00.000Z	urlin2u	hangingclowns	are you familiar with changing the repos, ansd the apt/sources.list
2011-11-09T08:39:00.000Z	urlin2u	hangingclowns	no, you probably can fix the apt-get.

2011-11-09T08:41:00.000Z	urlin2u	hangingclowns	have you proxied your set up? I haven't had that problem others would know more.
2011-11-09T08:43:00.000Z	urlin2u	hangingclowns	if you want the bot from menu you can get it with a key prompt and common one is f12 to see the usb .
2011-11-09T08:43:00.000Z	urlin2u	hangingclowns	this is a post bios boot from menu.
2011-11-09T08:44:00.000Z	urlin2u	hangingclowns	I can't gaurantee f12 will work but there is a key or key set prompt hit like you would going to the bios at powering on.

2011-11-09T08:49:00.000Z	urlin2u	hangingclowns	when you tried f12 what did you do exactly and when?
2011-11-09T08:50:00.000Z	urlin2u	hangingclowns	not post bios as soon as you hit power try tapping f12 if it does not work try f10 then esc all at single powering on attempts not together.
2011-11-09T08:50:00.000Z	urlin2u	hangingclowns	tap repeatedly
