2010-01-21T23:47:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	blakkheim	that ppa already has firefox 3.7
2010-02-09T07:53:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	blakkheim	could you please stop telling everyone who asks a question to "man X" it's similar to RTFM
2010-02-09T07:54:00.000Z	blakkheim	ZykoticK9	yeah, it's the "nice way" of saying that
2010-02-09T07:54:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	blakkheim	well it's not really very "nice"
2010-02-09T07:54:00.000Z	blakkheim	ZykoticK9	nicer than the alternative
2010-02-16T01:54:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	blakkheim	you're thining of nvidia-xconfig i believe
2010-03-10T01:26:00.000Z	blakkheim	ZykoticK9	log not logs
2010-03-10T01:39:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	blakkheim	but 2.6.33 isn't used by Lucid, just an FYI (at least not by default anyway)
2010-03-10T01:39:00.000Z	blakkheim	ZykoticK9	that's why i said "most likely" supported, i don't know for sure
2010-03-27T02:54:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	blakkheim	actually the failed to parse error isn't because of root
2010-03-29T21:36:00.000Z	blakkheim	ZykoticK9	or much NICER, depending on the person using it
2010-03-29T21:36:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	blakkheim	true - it's actually the only working version in Lucid right now, so it's what I'm using, but...
2010-03-29T22:01:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	blakkheim	is that statement even true anymore?
2010-03-29T22:01:00.000Z	blakkheim	ZykoticK9	i wouldn't have said it if it wasn't
2010-03-29T22:02:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	blakkheim	sorry :)
2010-11-09T05:53:00.000Z	blakkheim	ZykoticK9	do you get offended on a personal level when someone says "wtf" on the internet?
2010-11-09T05:55:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	blakkheim	not really - BUT i do thing the no swearing and staying ontopic is very important if this channel is going to survive and thrive.  Keeping high standards towards support only is important - and the no swearing, including tla is something I think should not be tolerated at all.  yagoo/blakkeim i'm sorry if i upset either of you.
