2011-02-13T06:00:00.000Z	joshie	sinisterstuf	 nope.  i have a thinkpad x61t with sound buttons above the keyboard that were working when sound was working.

2011-02-13T06:02:00.000Z	sinisterstuf	joshie	what has no file or directory?
2011-02-13T06:02:00.000Z	joshie	sinisterstuf	not sure if the buttons work and sound is dead, or if the buttons functionality is also broke
