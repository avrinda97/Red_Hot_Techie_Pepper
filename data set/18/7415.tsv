2008-10-01T21:56:00.000Z	Pici	ironfoot_495	Can you phrase that as a question?
2008-10-01T21:57:00.000Z	ironfoot_495	Pici	Yes is there somewhere to get the details on installing ubuntu on a DSVB-D SERVER?
2008-10-01T21:58:00.000Z	Pici	ironfoot_495	Are you trying to install Ubuntu Server?
2008-10-01T21:58:00.000Z	ironfoot_495	Pici	YES!!!
2008-10-01T21:58:00.000Z	Pici	ironfoot_495	On a RAID?
2008-10-01T21:59:00.000Z	ironfoot_495	Pici	on dula processors!!!
2008-10-01T21:59:00.000Z	ironfoot_495	Pici	No just have one SCSI Hard Drive
2008-10-01T21:59:00.000Z	Pici	ironfoot_495	Dual processors shouldnt have any effect on the install.  Where are you having difficutly?
2008-10-01T22:01:00.000Z	ironfoot_495	Pici	Not seeing the eth0 or eth1 or the SCSI ?
2008-10-01T22:01:00.000Z	Pici	ironfoot_495	So you've already installed?
2008-10-01T22:01:00.000Z	ironfoot_495	Pici	Well I'm attempting to and these are the problems I'm having.
2008-10-01T22:02:00.000Z	Pici	ironfoot_495	What version of Ubuntu are you trying to install and what adaptec?
2008-10-01T22:07:00.000Z	Pici	ironfoot_495	Doing a little googling reveals that this particular scsi card does software RAID, which is probably why its giving you issues.  You may be able to either disable RAID alltogether from your scsi BIOS, or /msg ubottu RAID   for more install help.
2008-10-01T22:07:00.000Z	ironfoot_495	Pici	I appreciate that thanx go after it again Bye!!!
