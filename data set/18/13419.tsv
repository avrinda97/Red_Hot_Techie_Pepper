2005-12-24T14:39:00.000Z	funkyHat		I just put a hard drive in a removable drive bay (while the computer was on), how do I access the drive? It should be hdd, but I can't mount or use fdisk...
2005-12-24T14:39:00.000Z	sethk	funkyHat	there may not be hotplug support enabled for that type of device.
2005-12-24T14:39:00.000Z	sethk	funkyHat	most likely there is not
2005-12-24T14:40:00.000Z	funkyHat	sethk	so how can i 'detect' it manually?
2005-12-24T14:40:00.000Z	sethk	funkyHat	you can't.   you have to configure hotplug support for it.
2005-12-24T14:41:00.000Z	funkyHat	sethk	can you help me with that?
2005-12-27T17:08:00.000Z	sethk	funkyHat	I do it with an authorized_hosts file in the .ssh directory
2005-12-27T17:08:00.000Z	sethk	funkyHat	the file is a bit misnamed, it actually specifies user@host combinations
2005-12-27T17:10:00.000Z	sethk	funkyHat	you just add a line to the file
2005-12-27T17:10:00.000Z	sethk	funkyHat	you need to have the key, of course
2005-12-27T17:11:00.000Z	funkyHat	sethk	ok, so I generate the key on the remote host, and then copy it across and put it in the local authourised_hosts?
2005-12-27T17:11:00.000Z	sethk	funkyHat	right.
2005-12-27T17:20:00.000Z	sethk	funkyHat	great
2005-12-27T17:21:00.000Z	sethk	funkyHat	saves a lot of typing, plus you can now disable passwords and protect yourself from a password attack
2006-01-01T08:23:00.000Z	funkyHat	sethk	I don't think that's what Shadyman meant lol
2006-01-01T08:23:00.000Z	funkyHat	sethk	make was 'cause' rather than the program make ;)
2006-01-01T08:24:00.000Z	sethk	funkyHat	oh, he thinks sudo will pick up roots environment
2006-01-01T08:24:00.000Z	funkyHat	sethk	ya
