2005-05-15T05:50:00.000Z	kyncani	exalted	while using apt ? apt cannot have two instances at the same time, a lock file prevents that i think. As for the remove everything but thing, you can use debfoster (it's very good)
2005-05-15T05:52:00.000Z	exalted	kyncani	on the other hand you're tellin' me to re-install all system.
2005-05-15T05:52:00.000Z	kyncani	exalted	? i think we do not understand each other
2005-05-15T05:52:00.000Z	exalted	kyncani	why you think so? :)
2005-05-15T05:53:00.000Z	kyncani	exalted	:) you want to remove everything but ubuntu-base, right ?
2005-05-15T05:53:00.000Z	exalted	kyncani	exactly, and as ubuntu-base is a metapackage, all other related packages to it.
2005-05-15T05:54:00.000Z	kyncani	exalted	debfoster is a tool that can remove every package that's not a dependency of a few packages you clearly identify.
2005-05-15T05:54:00.000Z	exalted	kyncani	but himself stays right? :)
2005-05-15T05:55:00.000Z	kyncani	exalted	can be used to remove unused library, or remove a program you do not want any more, along with everything it has installed
2005-05-15T05:55:00.000Z	kyncani	exalted	ha ha :) cannot be deleted, you have to destroy the damn box :)
2005-05-15T05:56:00.000Z	exalted	kyncani	what do you mean now?
2005-05-15T05:56:00.000Z	kyncani	exalted	;)
2005-05-15T05:57:00.000Z	kyncani	exalted	apt-cache show debfoster  to see what it's for ;)
2005-05-15T05:57:00.000Z	exalted	kyncani	i think it does not a part of the main repositorie...
2005-05-15T05:58:00.000Z	kyncani	exalted	don't know, somewhere between main, restricted, universe and multiverse
2005-05-15T05:58:00.000Z	exalted	kyncani	allright thx
