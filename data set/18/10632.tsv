2010-03-07T12:05:00.000Z	deostroll		hi trying to install 9.10 os from 8.10, but having difficulty upgrading to 9.04 first....
2010-03-07T12:06:00.000Z	Jordan_U	deostroll	What problem are you having exactly?
2010-03-07T12:12:00.000Z	Jordan_U	deostroll	What does an iso on a pen drive have to do with upgrading from 8.10 to 9.04?
2010-03-07T12:14:00.000Z	Jordan_U	deostroll	Why not just use update-manager?
2010-03-07T12:15:00.000Z	Jordan_U	deostroll	You need to use the alternate install CD to upgrade, but there is no way that downloading the alternate CD will take less time than just upgrading
2010-03-07T12:16:00.000Z	Jordan_U	deostroll	No.
2010-03-07T12:17:00.000Z	Jordan_U	deostroll	Did you download the "alternate" iso or the (normal) "Desktop" iso?
2010-03-07T12:19:00.000Z	Jordan_U	deostroll	The Desktop iso or the Alternate iso?
2010-03-07T12:20:00.000Z	Jordan_U	deostroll	The Alternate CD can be used to upgrade Ubuntu, the Desktop CD can't. If you didn't choose the alternate explicitly then you have the Desktop CD.
2010-03-07T12:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	deostroll	Don't bother with trying to upgrade from an iso. Just find a faster mirror with System > Administration > Software Sources.
2010-03-07T12:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U	deostroll	First go to System > Administration > Software Sources. Tell me when you have done that.
2010-03-07T12:24:00.000Z	Jordan_U	deostroll	There should be a drop down menu labeled "Download from", select "other".
2010-03-07T12:24:00.000Z	Jordan_U	deostroll	Now click on Select Best Server
2010-03-07T12:27:00.000Z	Jordan_U	deostroll	Yes.
2010-03-07T12:28:00.000Z	Jordan_U	deostroll	The servers in / near India may be somewhat overloaded currently.
2010-03-07T12:29:00.000Z	Jordan_U	deostroll	Now try upgrading via update-manager again and with the faster server it should take less time.
2010-03-07T12:30:00.000Z	Jordan_U	deostroll	No
2010-03-07T12:30:00.000Z	Jordan_U	deostroll	Hit close and when it asks if you want to update the package information say yes.
