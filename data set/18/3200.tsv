2009-12-13T08:11:00.000Z	rodgerr		is there a version of skype running on 9.10?

2009-12-13T08:12:00.000Z	nytek_	rodgerr	you running ubuntu 9.10?
2009-12-13T08:12:00.000Z	nytek_	rodgerr	open terminal, sudo apt-get install skype
2009-12-13T08:14:00.000Z	nytek_	rodgerr	I think the company, Skype isn't opensourced.
2009-12-13T08:15:00.000Z	nytek_	rodgerr	yeah, it's not well advertised for linux
2009-12-13T08:15:00.000Z	rodgerr	nytek_	do you use it??
2009-12-13T08:15:00.000Z	nytek_	rodgerr	skype?
2009-12-13T08:17:00.000Z	rodgerr	nytek_	there - see - skype not worth installing
2009-12-13T08:17:00.000Z	nytek_	rodgerr	thats the reason I dont use it and microphones never work
2009-12-13T08:18:00.000Z	nytek_	rodgerr	i would run a virtual system to use skype. im running xp right now though
2009-12-13T08:19:00.000Z	nytek_	rodgerr	i think im done with running distros off my internal hd, Im just going to create virutal systems
2009-12-13T08:21:00.000Z	rodgerr	nytek_	XP kept crashing and I could not find the hardware problem so I put in a new HD and loaded Ubuntu and it works!!  I have had enoug heart ache from M$, now I get my heartaches from Ubuntu!
2009-12-13T08:23:00.000Z	nytek_	rodgerr	lol, i completely understand. I still love linux distrobutions, I got into trying different window managers, ended with a tiling one. I still use its perfectly programmed terminal base apps
2009-12-13T08:23:00.000Z	rodgerr	nytek_	you must have another source for your skpe because install won't find it with th defualt sources
2009-12-13T08:49:00.000Z	rodgerr	nytek_	SKYPE works like a champ so far - able to configure it and talka nd listen to the test messages - video is slow but working
2009-12-13T08:49:00.000Z	nytek_	rodgerr	congrats, thats good to know. it was probably because i wasnt using ubuntu at the time :D
2009-12-13T09:25:00.000Z	rodgerr	nytek_	SKYPE - spent the last hour trying to find my profile for skype to edit it - turns out the linux version does not give access to the profile!!!
