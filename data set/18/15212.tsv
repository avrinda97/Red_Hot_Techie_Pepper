2005-04-24T09:02:00.000Z	AlfonsVH		I've got a problem; I'm trying to install Wine in Kubuntu, but I don't know how to change the repositories in Kynaptic. When I try to install it with apt-get, it says: "E: malformed line 28 in source list", while I don't find any errors.
2005-04-24T09:03:00.000Z	Shufla	AlfonsVH	put 28th line here.
2005-04-24T09:04:00.000Z	Shufla	AlfonsVH	hm. try to put `./' on the end.
2005-04-24T09:05:00.000Z	AlfonsVH	Shufla	do you mean to put it after the last slash, or underneath?
2005-04-24T09:05:00.000Z	Shufla	AlfonsVH	make it look like: deb-src http://wine.sourceforge.net/apt/source/ ./
2005-04-24T09:07:00.000Z	AlfonsVH	Shufla	it works now. Thanks for the information!!!
2005-04-24T09:07:00.000Z	Shufla	AlfonsVH	n/p
2005-04-24T09:10:00.000Z	Shufla	AlfonsVH	synaptic? refresh it.
2005-04-24T09:11:00.000Z	AlfonsVH	Shufla	nope, I'm using atp-get; not synaptic, since that isn't included in Kubuntu
2005-04-24T09:11:00.000Z	Shufla	AlfonsVH	apt-get update.
2005-04-24T09:12:00.000Z	AlfonsVH	Shufla	it gives that error when I try to do the update
2005-04-24T09:12:00.000Z	Shufla	AlfonsVH	type that line here...
2005-04-24T09:12:00.000Z	Shufla	AlfonsVH	change deb-src to deb.
2005-04-24T09:23:00.000Z	Shufla	AlfonsVH	hm... your hosts should look like: <2_char_country_code>.archive.ubuntu.com
2005-04-24T09:24:00.000Z	Shufla	AlfonsVH	but for now be.archive.ubuntu.com points to same as archive.ubuntu.com (or my DNS tells me lies)
2005-04-24T09:25:00.000Z	AlfonsVH	Shufla	I tried us.archive.ubuntu.com and be.archive.ubuntu.com; they all work fine in my browser, but for some reason the apt-get can't connect to them
2005-04-24T09:38:00.000Z	Shufla	AlfonsVH	what lsmod | grep snd says?
2005-04-24T09:51:00.000Z	Shufla	AlfonsVH	ah. ok
