2010-10-04T08:01:00.000Z	duolos		For some reason Firefox is really slow to start loading a page.  The status bar shows "Looking up [doman]..." for a few seconds before the page actually starts to load.   What could be causing this?
2010-10-04T08:03:00.000Z	icarus-c	duolos	maybe slow DNS query
2010-10-04T08:04:00.000Z	icarus-c	duolos	or maybe firefox is contacting google to check for known malicious website,  you could disable this function
2010-10-04T08:04:00.000Z	duolos	icarus-c	how would I determine that?  I'm not sure if they're using custom proxies/dns servers in this distro
2010-10-04T08:04:00.000Z	duolos	icarus-c	okay, I'll check that real quick
2010-10-04T08:04:00.000Z	icarus-c	duolos	well, check what dns server you are using in  connection information.  and you try to benchmark it.
2010-10-04T08:05:00.000Z	icarus-c	duolos	you could do simple test like "dig  google.com"   or with a DNS benchmark program like namebench
2010-10-04T08:06:00.000Z	icarus-c	duolos	try to dig some other site, like those you haven't visited recently (last few hours)
2010-10-04T08:07:00.000Z	duolos	icarus-c	all under 20ms
2010-10-04T08:07:00.000Z	icarus-c	duolos	and you may want to go firefox preferences->Security -> disable "block reported attack site" and "block reported web forgeries"
2010-10-04T08:08:00.000Z	icarus-c	duolos	those 2 firefox functions would query google everytime you access a website
2010-10-04T08:08:00.000Z	icarus-c	duolos	and after you disable those functions, you may want to remove "urlclassifier3.sqlite" file in your firefox profile folder too
2010-10-04T08:09:00.000Z	duolos	icarus-c	okay, I already disabled those two functions (I'm smart enough not to need them lol).
2010-10-04T08:11:00.000Z	duolos	icarus-c	nope.  For example, heading to facebook.com, the status showed "Looking up facebook.com" for at least 7 seconds before it started to load.
2010-10-04T08:11:00.000Z	duolos	icarus-c	this happens for every link I click on as well.
2010-10-04T08:12:00.000Z	duolos	icarus-c	hmm, this Firefox came preloaded with several extensions.  I'll just try disabling them and see if one of them is causing it.
2010-10-04T08:19:00.000Z	icarus-c	duolos	what about other browsers?
2010-10-04T08:20:00.000Z	duolos	icarus-c	ah.  I'll try chrome in a few.  I'm installing a bunch of updates right now... maybe they'll fix the issue.
