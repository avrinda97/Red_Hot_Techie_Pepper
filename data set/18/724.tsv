2011-10-12T18:13:00.000Z	iDorito		Or is it just a regular version update?
2011-10-12T18:14:00.000Z	iDorito		Okay, so every 6 months, a new version of Ubuntu is released, and the Ubuntu Foundation commits to providing driver- and software updates for 18 months past the release for each and every release?
2011-10-12T18:14:00.000Z	iDorito		Except for LTS, which is supported for a longer period of time?
2011-10-12T18:15:00.000Z	iDorito		What about third party software?
2011-10-12T18:15:00.000Z	iDorito		How do third party release cycles tie in with Ubuntu
2011-10-12T18:15:00.000Z	iDorito		and how do you maintain compatibility
2011-10-12T18:16:00.000Z	iDorito		Wait, so are Ubuntu versions that are past their 18 month support eligibility offered any updates *at all* from the Ubuntu foundation?
2011-10-12T18:16:00.000Z	iDorito		Or are they dropped completely?
2011-10-12T18:17:00.000Z	iDorito		Ooh.
2011-10-12T18:17:00.000Z	iDorito		Okay.
2011-10-12T18:17:00.000Z	yorx39	iDorito	Dropped
2011-10-12T18:17:00.000Z	yorx39	iDorito	Makes you release how long Windows supports their OS for
2011-10-12T18:24:00.000Z	yorx39	iDorito	There are some disadvantages to Linux software management undoubtedly. Most users don't care if their core OS upgrades each six months, just the user software they use
2011-10-12T18:25:00.000Z	yorx39	iDorito	That's why some people use rolling release
2011-10-12T18:26:00.000Z	yorx39	iDorito	No, it's where your OS continuously upgrades whenever new software is available. The kernel, GNOME, everything
2011-10-12T18:29:00.000Z	yorx39	iDorito	Rolling release is hard to keep stable though, especially with so many integrated packages like Ubuntu. It's not without its own issues
2011-10-12T18:31:00.000Z	yorx39	iDorito	Rolling release is partly harder on Linux because the way shared libraries/software is used. On Windows every music player bundles its own MP3 decoder etc., on Linux they use the same one. It saves space (irrelevant these days) but makes it more complex
2011-10-12T18:33:00.000Z	yorx39	iDorito	You're not the first person to think these things. The fact application developers have to compile different versions of their application for not just separate distributions, but versions of those distros is lunacy. On Windows the same .exe will work on XP, Windows 7, Vista etc.
