2010-04-08T14:37:00.000Z	FriGiN		ok im reading the grub2 info ... and i see the read only files all im trying to do is make windows my default instead of ubuntu and remove a now defunct copy of ubuntu from the list.. where do i start
2010-04-08T14:39:00.000Z	erUSUL	FriGiN	to remove old kernel from grub just remove them from synaptic
2010-10-21T00:49:00.000Z	erUSUL	FriGiN	have you tried installing the backports modules wireless to see if a newer driver makes a difference ?
2010-10-21T00:49:00.000Z	FriGiN	erUSUL	no i'm unaware how to as well plz advise
2010-10-21T00:50:00.000Z	erUSUL	FriGiN	if the name did not change should be  --> sudo apt-get install linux-backports-modules-wireless-maverick-generic
2010-10-21T00:50:00.000Z	erUSUL	FriGiN	and reboot?
2010-10-21T00:54:00.000Z	FriGiN	erUSUL	downloading now, hopefully i get it b4 network crashes again.. its goin kinda slow.
2010-10-21T00:56:00.000Z	FriGiN	erUSUL	dropped before network finished doing its thing is there a way to download backports on a usb and then transfer?
2010-10-21T00:57:00.000Z	erUSUL	FriGiN	packages.ubuntu.com but you will have to dwonload the package that matches your ernel version
2010-10-21T00:58:00.000Z	FriGiN	erUSUL	maverick is 10.10 correct?
2010-10-21T00:58:00.000Z	erUSUL	FriGiN	also apt-get can resume downloads. so you can retry
2010-10-21T00:59:00.000Z	erUSUL	FriGiN	http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=linux-backports-modules-wireless&searchon=names&suite=maverick&section=all
2010-10-21T00:59:00.000Z	erUSUL	FriGiN	do "uname -a" to see your exact kernel version
2010-10-21T01:11:00.000Z	FriGiN	erUSUL	you know im noticing something.. if i don't try to download anything via the apt or "activate" my video card driver thats when my network stops..
2010-10-21T01:12:00.000Z	erUSUL	FriGiN	that's weird; thse things shouldn't affect the connection
2010-10-21T01:16:00.000Z	FriGiN	erUSUL	100% agreed. however, i ran for quite some time on just netscape.. even transmitted data no problems. i went to install backend, it said it had to transfer 30MB and i lost connectivity..
2010-10-21T01:21:00.000Z	FriGiN	erUSUL	just tested again.. i stayed connected for a while.. was surfing no problems.. i used "Ubuntu software center" got some random package and poof no more net.
2010-10-21T01:21:00.000Z	erUSUL	FriGiN	no idea; sorry.
