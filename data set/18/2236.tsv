2010-07-15T13:10:00.000Z	Deist		Something is eating up my hd. I found a file just keep growing.
2010-07-15T13:10:00.000Z	Deist		No, you don't. Almost sure.
2010-07-15T13:10:00.000Z	Deist		My CP is about to go kapputt.
2010-07-15T13:12:00.000Z	Deist		I really could use some help...
2010-07-15T13:12:00.000Z	Deist		its quite urgent.

2010-07-15T13:14:00.000Z	Deist	trijntje	x-session errors
2010-07-15T13:14:00.000Z	Deist		i removed it but no space was liberated.
2010-07-15T13:15:00.000Z	trijntje	Deist	its in your trash
2010-07-15T13:15:00.000Z	Deist		no it's not. I emtyd it.
2010-07-15T13:15:00.000Z	Deist		trijntje.
2010-07-15T13:16:00.000Z	trijntje	Deist	if its filling up your HD see what program is throwing all those errors
2010-07-15T13:17:00.000Z	Deist	trijntje	I can't really find what file causing the fillup anymore. The new x-session-errors is like 17 kb...
2010-07-15T13:18:00.000Z	trijntje		I need some help with Internet Connection Sharing. I tried the "GUI method" from the link ubottu gives but this leaves me unable to connect to the internet. Am I doing something wrong?
2010-07-15T13:19:00.000Z	trijntje	Deist	if its one file, you should be able to find it with applications -> assecoires -> disk usage
2010-07-15T13:20:00.000Z	Deist	trijntje	the biggest file i can find there is around 5 gb. My hd is around 130.
2010-07-15T13:29:00.000Z	trijntje	Deist	you might want to remove that file, if its in your home dir and you dont need it
