2006-11-06T14:02:00.000Z	avagant		Ok with xchat-gnome is there a way I can change where the users are?
2006-11-06T14:03:00.000Z	avagant		no but i mean i don't like the popup list.
2006-11-06T14:04:00.000Z	avagant		I want the popup list to show on the side.
2006-11-06T14:04:00.000Z	avagant		So I can actually tell who's in the room.
2006-11-06T14:04:00.000Z	avagant		DANG
2006-11-06T14:04:00.000Z	avagant		well I have both.
2006-11-06T14:04:00.000Z	avagant		haha
2006-11-06T14:04:00.000Z	avagant		So I just learned how to dualboot, and I'm super proud of myself.
2006-11-06T14:05:00.000Z	avagant		Well I tried dual booting with linux first.
2006-11-06T14:05:00.000Z	avagant		And that didn't work.
2006-11-06T14:05:00.000Z	cge	avagant	That has the user list type that you want.
2006-11-06T14:03:00.000Z	cge	avagant	No (it's xchat GNOME!)
2006-11-06T14:04:00.000Z	cge	avagant	Yes, you can't do that in xchat-gnome. You could install xchat though.
2006-11-06T14:05:00.000Z	cge	avagant	The actual xchat is in universe though, if you install the xchat package.
2006-11-06T14:06:00.000Z	cge	avagant	Was it a downloaded copy :)
2006-11-06T14:07:00.000Z	cge	avagant	I actually use a downloaded copy even though I have a proper licence, because it installs more cleanly.
2006-11-06T14:08:00.000Z	avagant	cge	Actually I just have the media version.
2006-11-06T14:08:00.000Z	avagant	cge	But hey it works and it gets the job done.
