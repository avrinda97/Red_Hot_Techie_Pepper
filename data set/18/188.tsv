2012-06-22T00:24:00.000Z	Sire		I'm doing an ubuntu server install and after entering my desired hostname, the screen cleared the text-UI and isn't doing anything. Is it just loading or what?
2012-06-22T00:26:00.000Z	guntbert	Sire	use alt+left to switch to another virtual terminal, repeat until you find one with logging/reporting lines, there you can see what is gong on
2012-06-22T00:27:00.000Z	Sire	guntbert	last message was netcfg[12916]: DEBUG: Success!
2012-06-22T00:28:00.000Z	Sire	guntbert	so the primary virtual terminal that's supposed to display the UI just seems to be printing the characters typed.
2012-06-22T00:28:00.000Z	guntbert	Sire	do you already get a screen with something like  "press <enter> to open a console"  ?
2012-06-22T00:29:00.000Z	guntbert	Sire	you can log in there and have a look at the system
2012-06-22T00:30:00.000Z	Sire	guntbert	how so?
2012-06-22T00:31:00.000Z	guntbert	Sire	because you already have a running linux system during install
2012-06-22T00:31:00.000Z	Sire	guntbert	more of how do I work with this?
2012-06-22T00:32:00.000Z	guntbert	Sire	I thought you wanted to know if your install is stalled or not. This is how you can find out
2012-06-22T00:32:00.000Z	Sire	guntbert	yes, but I have no clue how to check that.
2012-06-22T00:34:00.000Z	guntbert	Sire	type   top - that might give you an overview of the running processes and the system load - just to determine what is going on
2012-06-22T00:35:00.000Z	Sire	guntbert	-/bin/sh: top: not found
2012-06-22T00:36:00.000Z	guntbert	Sire	does    free give anything but an error?   in the meantime take another round through your VTs
2012-06-22T00:37:00.000Z	Sire	guntbert	`free` works just fine and the only thing that's happened to the status output is it's reporting me exiting and restarting the virtual terminal.
2012-06-22T00:42:00.000Z	guntbert	Sire	free was the wrong tool anyway :)    type    ps aux --sort=%cpu    to see what processes are running
2012-06-22T00:43:00.000Z	Sire	guntbert	well, I was just looking into `ps`, but I have to do something else. I'll be back around to work on this later.
2012-06-22T00:43:00.000Z	guntbert	Sire	no problem :)
