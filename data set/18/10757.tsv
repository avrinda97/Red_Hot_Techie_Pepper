2008-03-31T15:15:00.000Z	guillem101		Is there any way to get a cell processor, besides of buying a PS3?
2008-03-31T15:15:00.000Z	Svenstaro	guillem101	only if you are a big-name industry or an excentric millionaire
2008-03-31T15:16:00.000Z	guillem101	Svenstaro	thanks1
2008-03-31T15:16:00.000Z	guillem101	Svenstaro	thanks!
2008-03-31T15:17:00.000Z	Svenstaro	guillem101	IBM said 3 years ago that it might be released into some form of PC-comptible piece of hardware in a couple of years but I dont think thats in sony's interest
2008-03-31T15:17:00.000Z	guillem101	Svenstaro	I can buy a PS-3, and install linux on it so I can program the cell thing. Is that OK?
2008-03-31T15:18:00.000Z	Svenstaro	guillem101	yes
2008-03-31T15:18:00.000Z	Svenstaro	guillem101	be aware tho that not only very few binary applications will work, and you will not get the graphics drivers to work
2008-03-31T15:19:00.000Z	guillem101	Svenstaro	Oh, I see there is a PS3Linux channel; I'm going to ask them a couple of questions :). Thank you very much
2008-03-31T15:19:00.000Z	guillem101	Svenstaro	I want to crunch numbers.... he he
2008-03-31T15:19:00.000Z	Svenstaro	guillem101	thats a very good practice, PS3 make excellent cracking machines
2008-03-31T15:20:00.000Z	guillem101	Svenstaro	ahem; scientific crunching. I want to evaluate how difficult is to write scientific software for the PS3....
2008-03-31T15:20:00.000Z	Svenstaro	guillem101	may I suggest the usage of CUDA instead of a ps3? much more comfortable
2008-03-31T15:21:00.000Z	guillem101	Svenstaro	you can suggest what you want. I'm willing to get enlightened. What is CUDA?
2008-03-31T15:22:00.000Z	guillem101	Svenstaro	oh, I see, GPU-computing.
2008-03-31T15:22:00.000Z	Svenstaro	guillem101	its Nvidia way to turn your graphics card into a super computer, works really well for the stuff that you have in mind. Everything that can be massively threaded will look like its being done on a super computer. The catch is that you need a series 8 nvidia card.
2008-03-31T15:24:00.000Z	guillem101	Svenstaro	nice!. I've already used the GPU to "compute" radiation view factors via offscreen rendering. This seems to be much more general.
2008-03-31T15:25:00.000Z	Svenstaro	guillem101	yup :)
