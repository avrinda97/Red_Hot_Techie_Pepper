2007-03-26T08:02:00.000Z	vvlaw		i got a problem when i complie the mplayer, who can help me ?
2007-03-26T08:02:00.000Z	Ademan	vvlaw	don't compile mplayer?
2007-03-26T08:03:00.000Z	Ademan	vvlaw	but what exactly is the problem? (i sincerely reccomend you DON"T compile mplayer yourself)
2007-03-26T08:03:00.000Z	vvlaw	Ademan	icompiled mplayer already 
2007-03-26T08:04:00.000Z	Ademan	vvlaw	why? is there anything wrong with the precompiled one?
2007-03-26T08:05:00.000Z	vvlaw	Ademan	yes, compiled it.and worked fine,but there are no "xv" option in the output selection :(
2007-03-26T08:05:00.000Z	Ademan	vvlaw	what's wrong with the precompiled version that comes with ubuntu though?
2007-03-26T08:08:00.000Z	vvlaw	Ademan	i can player tha avi files well,but i can only basic on "x11" output ~
2007-03-26T08:11:00.000Z	vvlaw	Ademan	i mean that i want to let mplayer can be support the "xv" output,but it can't :(
2007-03-26T08:12:00.000Z	Ademan	vvlaw	i don't understand what compelled you to compile mplayer though
2007-03-26T08:12:00.000Z	vvlaw	Ademan	complied mplayer through the sources,not by the apt-get way
2007-03-26T08:13:00.000Z	Ademan	vvlaw	yes, but why?
2007-03-26T08:14:00.000Z	vvlaw	Ademan	is the have the "xv" selection support in your mplayer ? i don't have it
2007-03-26T08:15:00.000Z	Ademan	vvlaw	oh so the version that came with ubuntu didn't have the xv?
2007-03-26T08:16:00.000Z	Ademan	vvlaw	yes i have the xv output in my mplayer, and i didn't compile anything myself
2007-03-26T08:17:00.000Z	vvlaw	Ademan	i see . you got it throught the apt-get install way?
2007-03-26T08:17:00.000Z	Ademan	vvlaw	yep
2007-03-26T08:19:00.000Z	vvlaw	Ademan	in my memory,i apt-get install it at first. and it maybe have the 'xv' optition in it.but after that i reinstall it through the sources. but it have no xv selection after i compiled it :(
