2011-10-24T17:08:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	digimon19	try iwlist
2011-10-24T17:09:00.000Z	digimon19	MonkeyDust	iwlist then ...? What is the full command? xD
2011-10-24T17:09:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	digimon19	try iwlist ap
2011-10-24T17:12:00.000Z	digimon19	MonkeyDust	I get, interface doesn't support scanning. :)
2011-10-24T17:29:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	digimon19	try arp -vn
2011-10-24T17:30:00.000Z	digimon19	MonkeyDust	That only gives the IP adress of my own router. I am trying to find the IP addresses of all the routers that my wireless can catch.
