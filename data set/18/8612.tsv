2008-05-10T09:44:00.000Z	wolfjb		how do I turn off desktop switching when I scroll with the mouse wheel?
2008-05-10T09:45:00.000Z	vocx	wolfjb	don't place the pointer in the desktop switcher?
2008-05-10T09:46:00.000Z	wolfjb	vocx	if the mouse pointer is over the desktop and I scroll with the mouse it switches desktop, very annoying - I'd love to turn it off
2008-05-10T09:50:00.000Z	vocx	wolfjb	about your issue, I don't know. Maybe because you have desktop effects or something?
2008-05-10T09:50:00.000Z	wolfjb	vocx	I do have desktop effects turned on, I like the wobly windows.
2008-05-10T09:52:00.000Z	vocx	wolfjb	well you should probably mention that. Well I don't know. I don't use it. It's probably possible.
2008-05-10T09:52:00.000Z	vocx	wolfjb	I just scrolled and realized they suggested you the compiz manager or something.
2008-05-10T09:53:00.000Z	wolfjb	vocx	yeah, I tried turning it off, but it didn't help
2008-05-10T09:54:00.000Z	wolfjb	vocx	prolly means I need to logoff/logon or something, I guess
2008-05-10T09:54:00.000Z	wolfjb	vocx	used to find the setting in the window manager settings, I think
2008-05-10T09:54:00.000Z	vocx	wolfjb	sure, logoff and then tell us if it worked.
2008-05-10T09:58:00.000Z	vocx	wolfjb	you can always add new workspaces, right click on the switcher.
2008-05-10T09:59:00.000Z	wolfjb	vocx	tried that, didnt' work-  the preferences only show how many columns/rows to display, didn't offer to create additional workspaces for me
2008-05-10T10:06:00.000Z	wolfjb	vocx	oddly, if I switched off my desktop effects, my workspaces appeared. re-enabling the desktop effects (so far) have not removed the extra workspaces. very odd
2008-05-10T10:07:00.000Z	vocx	wolfjb	if you can reproduce that, you might want to call it a bug and report it to package in launchpad
2008-05-10T10:09:00.000Z	wolfjb	vocx	ok, after logoff and logon, everything works like I want it to. thanks
2008-05-10T10:09:00.000Z	vocx	wolfjb	he I just posted something when you left. I said that if you think you can reproduce that you could fill or search for a bug report or something in launchpad.
2008-05-10T10:10:00.000Z	wolfjb	vocx	I'll see what I can do
