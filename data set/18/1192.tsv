2011-05-01T22:25:00.000Z	MrTolkinghorn		hey, anyone had problems with instability with a kernel? Whenever I have my stable overclocks on (4.2 ghz on a core i7) my computer crashes despite windows working just fine with hours of prime95...
2011-05-01T22:26:00.000Z	MrTolkinghorn		2.6.32-28 was the only truly stable kernel, any of the new ones crash
2011-05-01T22:26:00.000Z	tensorpudding	MrTolkinghorn	you should isolate what is causing it to crash, first
2011-05-01T22:26:00.000Z	tensorpudding	MrTolkinghorn	is it a kernel panic?
2011-05-01T22:27:00.000Z	MrTolkinghorn	tensorpudding	I'm having trouble finding any errors in the log
2011-05-01T22:27:00.000Z	MrTolkinghorn	tensorpudding	it is a kernel panic then
2011-05-01T22:28:00.000Z	MrTolkinghorn	tensorpudding	but it isn't giving me a clear error
2011-05-01T22:28:00.000Z	MrTolkinghorn	tensorpudding	no it works just fine without an overclock
2011-05-01T22:29:00.000Z	MrTolkinghorn	tensorpudding	how can I turn on dump core, so I can get a clear error message?
2011-05-01T22:30:00.000Z	MrTolkinghorn	tensorpudding	ok thanks, I can just look it up of course. Now that I know it ISN't dumping the core.
2011-05-01T22:31:00.000Z	MrTolkinghorn	tensorpudding	no I haven't, I'm actually not sure what that is. I'll install that.
2011-05-01T22:32:00.000Z	MrTolkinghorn	tensorpudding	ok. I've tried to turn of acpi and turn on hpet thinking it might have been a problem related to those.
2011-05-01T22:33:00.000Z	tensorpudding	MrTolkinghorn	have you checked /var/log/dmesg
2011-05-01T22:33:00.000Z	tensorpudding	MrTolkinghorn	and /var/log/kern.log
2011-05-01T22:33:00.000Z	MrTolkinghorn	tensorpudding	there was nothing that I could find related to the crash in there.
2011-05-01T22:33:00.000Z	MrTolkinghorn	tensorpudding	same with that, nothing that really stood out.
2011-05-01T22:35:00.000Z	MrTolkinghorn	tensorpudding	every time it crashes, it's a solid lock-up. the keyboard flashes, and it reboots in 30 seconds. I can only assume that's a kernel panic. sometimes If it crashes when booting, it'll show some of the error messages, but none of them seem related to the crash, just more stuff which looks like normal boot kernel log messages.
2011-05-01T22:36:00.000Z	tensorpudding	MrTolkinghorn	i guess that sounds like a panic, but every panic that i've had, when it happens, it switches to the console and dumps a stacktrace
