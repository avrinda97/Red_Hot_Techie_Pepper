2012-02-29T22:31:00.000Z	arnpro		hey guys, my recently has recently been reported as doing suspicious activities, and according to logs, it has been trying to access root of other servers
2012-02-29T22:31:00.000Z	arnpro		so how can I check if any malicicious script is doing it?
2012-02-29T22:33:00.000Z	Chipzzz	arnpro	do you have a wireless router?
2012-02-29T22:34:00.000Z	arnpro	Chipzzz	my server is hosted in server4you, it's a vServer, right now they gave me recovery access, and the data is mounted in /mnt, how can I check what part of my server tried accessing others?? is there any logs for it?
2012-02-29T22:37:00.000Z	Chipzzz	arnpro	you could start by checking auth.log to see if someone else has access that you don't know about
2012-02-29T22:38:00.000Z	Chipzzz	arnpro	...and your hosting company should have the particulars of the intrusions...
2012-02-29T22:38:00.000Z	arnpro	Chipzzz	there is no auth.log in /var/log, however there is a messages file, should I check there?
2012-02-29T22:40:00.000Z	arnpro	Chipzzz	where can I find the history file of a user?
2012-02-29T22:41:00.000Z	Chipzzz	arnpro	you mean the terminal commands history?
2012-02-29T22:46:00.000Z	Chipzzz	arnpro	arnpro sounds like you've been hacked
2012-02-29T22:47:00.000Z	arnpro	Chipzzz	llutz: is there any way to trace a hacked server? without bash_history and auth.log???
2012-02-29T22:49:00.000Z	Chipzzz	arnpro	is you site php or python?
2012-02-29T22:50:00.000Z	arnpro	Chipzzz	php maybe, we got Plesk set up for mailing stuff
2012-02-29T22:51:00.000Z	Chipzzz	arnpro	your hosting company will probably want you to take some measures to prevent another unauthorized access
2012-02-29T22:52:00.000Z	arnpro	Chipzzz	hope they do, because the goal of this server was to have no administration, but easy stuff to use...
2012-02-29T22:53:00.000Z	Chipzzz	arnpro	most are accomplished through various exploits of the underlying code
2012-02-29T22:55:00.000Z	arnpro	Chipzzz	I already saved all the logs I could and going to ask my host to back them up for me
2012-02-29T22:58:00.000Z	Chipzzz	arnpro	yes, but often the code doesn't have to be modified to be exploited... you could, however easily check with a recursive ls sorted by date
