2008-08-14T21:53:00.000Z	Prose		anyone know any cross-platform (ubuntu&windowsxp) music managers? I am trying to sync music libraries between 4 computers (2 windows and 2 linux)
2008-08-14T21:54:00.000Z	John80	Prose	look for jav-based music managers
2008-08-14T21:56:00.000Z	Prose	John80	you want to ''extend'' the screen ?
2008-08-14T21:56:00.000Z	John80	Prose	yes, and I already have that using xinorama
2008-08-14T21:57:00.000Z	Prose	John80	 what's missing ?
2008-08-14T22:01:00.000Z	Prose	John80	what happens when you resize the movie windows while on the TV to fill the screen ?
2008-08-14T22:02:00.000Z	John80	Prose	it works
2008-08-14T22:03:00.000Z	Prose	John80	so basically, it's really the 'full screen'' command on the player that does the trouble. What about other player s?
2008-08-14T22:03:00.000Z	John80	Prose	will try...
2008-08-14T22:05:00.000Z	John80	Prose	You were right, it has something to do with VLC, it works in Totem
2008-08-14T22:06:00.000Z	Prose	John80	it is a plausible solution to switch your movie-watching to Totem ?
2008-08-14T22:07:00.000Z	John80	Prose	I would rather use VLC :) Will check VLC settings for some clues...
2008-08-14T22:08:00.000Z	Prose	John80	last thing I get think about is check any resolution settings in your ubuntu config or in VLC
2008-08-14T22:09:00.000Z	Prose	John80	otherwise, good luck and at least you can Totem your movies :) :P
2008-08-14T22:09:00.000Z	John80	Prose	thx ;)
2008-08-14T22:11:00.000Z	John80	Prose	solved! There is a setting for which screen to use for fullscreen (advanced)
2008-08-14T22:12:00.000Z	Prose	John80	awesome! exploration ftw !
2008-08-14T22:13:00.000Z	John80	Prose	:D
