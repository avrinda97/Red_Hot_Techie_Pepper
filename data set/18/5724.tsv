2008-11-09T16:12:00.000Z	artyg		Well, I'm installing the Alt install (Previously, on "Whining: The series") and it forces me to pick a mirror and such.
2008-11-09T16:12:00.000Z	artyg		And if I don't have it connected to my slow, slow internet, it won't let me install it as it is on the storage device.
2008-11-09T16:13:00.000Z	outbackwifi	artyg	ah you're trying to install from  an iso of the alt cd which is on a storage device?
2008-11-09T16:14:00.000Z	outbackwifi	artyg	cant do that, im afraid
2008-11-09T16:15:00.000Z	outbackwifi	artyg	you need to burn the alt iso to a cd and boot off it
2008-11-09T16:15:00.000Z	outbackwifi	artyg	unless you made a usb installer out of it
2008-11-09T16:16:00.000Z	outbackwifi	artyg	so it stops being an iso after that; but coming back to your question, i havent seen mine asking for the 'net
2008-11-09T16:19:00.000Z	outbackwifi	artyg	that looks like a netboot image
2008-11-09T16:32:00.000Z	outbackwifi	artyg	dont know if this is what you want but look here --> http://paul.jurco.ro/2008/02/28/ubuntu-console-text-size/
2008-11-09T16:48:00.000Z	outbackwifi	artyg	havent used a cd drive for a year now :O
2008-11-09T16:51:00.000Z	outbackwifi	artyg	which stage of installation
2008-11-09T17:56:00.000Z	outbackwifi	artyg	its not about debian or ubuntu; drivers are part of the kernel and should work anywhere
2008-11-09T18:34:00.000Z	outbackwifi	artyg	the magic is mkdir /mnt/magicmountpointthatartywants
2008-11-09T18:38:00.000Z	outbackwifi	artyg	you need to use the proper mount command
2008-11-09T18:39:00.000Z	outbackwifi	artyg	it is sudo mount /dev/devicename /mnt/mountpoint
2008-11-09T18:41:00.000Z	outbackwifi	artyg	in the installer shell you already are root; if you see # you know you are
2008-11-09T18:42:00.000Z	outbackwifi	artyg	you seem to have started from a wrong premise and are trying to work around that
2008-11-09T18:44:00.000Z	outbackwifi	artyg	the way i did it with a eeeppc was to install standard distro and replace the kernel with one specific  to the eeepc
