2004-12-12T11:02:00.000Z	Skwid_		is there an xorg config tool ?
2004-12-12T11:04:00.000Z	kelly_	Skwid_	dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg. if you want to re-order the resolutions, you may be better off editing /etc/X11/xorg.conf by hand
2004-12-12T11:05:00.000Z	Skwid_		ok
2004-12-12T11:05:00.000Z	Skwid_		so i just change 1280 and 1024 on each line ?
2004-12-12T11:05:00.000Z	Skwid_		i meant, switch
2004-12-12T11:06:00.000Z	kelly_		yes. same as XF86Config, basically. X will start with whatever res is listed first, ctrl-alt-+ will cycle to the next, and so on
2004-12-12T11:06:00.000Z	Skwid_	kelly_	ok
2004-12-12T11:07:00.000Z	Skwid_		can i just delete the 1280 entries ?
2004-12-12T11:07:00.000Z	kelly_		if you don't ever want to use them, sure
2004-12-12T11:07:00.000Z	Skwid_	kelly_	well, my screen shakes on 1280,
2004-12-12T11:08:00.000Z	Skwid_		but i'd rather be on 1280 :(
2004-12-12T11:09:00.000Z	kelly_		that could be a problem with the refresh rate. if you have the specs for your monitor, make sure horizsync and vertrefresh are set properly. depends on the monitor, though, obviously
2004-12-12T11:09:00.000Z	Skwid_	kelly_	hum, where can i find them ?
2004-12-12T11:10:00.000Z	kelly_	Skwid_	your monitor's manual, or google, or maybe another OS if you have one on your computer
2004-12-12T11:11:00.000Z	Skwid_	kelly_	ok, i'm looking
2004-12-12T11:13:00.000Z	Skwid_	kelly_	found it :)
2004-12-12T11:13:00.000Z	Skwid_	kelly_	don't really understand a thing though :/
2004-12-12T11:15:00.000Z	Skwid_	kelly_	it says it supports 1280*1024 though :/
