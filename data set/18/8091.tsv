2011-08-27T00:20:00.000Z	yeats	raven	can you pastebin exactly what you type (no passwords, of course) and the error message, then share the link?
2011-08-27T00:21:00.000Z	raven	yeats	its only "Permission denied, please try again."
2011-08-27T00:22:00.000Z	yeats	raven	what are you typing in - literally?
2011-08-27T00:22:00.000Z	yeats	raven	feel free to anonymize the user/host
2011-08-27T00:23:00.000Z	raven	yeats	ssh user@host      then the password      then the error
2011-08-27T00:24:00.000Z	yeats	raven	do you have any other access to the server?
2011-08-27T00:24:00.000Z	raven	yeats	usr13 root also does not work
2011-08-27T00:25:00.000Z	yeats	raven	your server? or administered by someone else?
2011-08-27T00:26:00.000Z	yeats	raven	I know you feel certain that you're logging into the correct server, but I suspect it's the wrong one
2011-08-27T00:27:00.000Z	raven	yeats	usr13 i only added me to the vboxusr group nothing else.
2011-08-27T00:27:00.000Z	yeats	raven	okay - so you have console access through VirtualBox?
2011-08-27T00:28:00.000Z	raven	yeats	no it was only for usb access
2011-08-27T00:29:00.000Z	yeats	raven	(repeating myself here, but) is this server administered by someone you can get help from? or is it yours?
2011-08-27T00:30:00.000Z	raven	yeats	its mine
2011-08-27T00:31:00.000Z	yeats	raven	it's a virtualized server on VirtualBox, no?
2011-08-27T00:32:00.000Z	raven	yeats	no this was only i hint that i changed anytzhing in the group settings for virtual box
2011-10-15T19:24:00.000Z	raven	yeats	ok tnx
2011-10-15T19:25:00.000Z	yeats	raven	note that it is not GNOME 2 - GNOME Shell is actually quite similar to Unity in many ways - fans of GNOME 2 are kind of left out in the cold by the major distros from here on it seems ;-)
