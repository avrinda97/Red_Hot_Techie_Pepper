2011-02-02T13:57:00.000Z	nVee		dude I will pay $50 for someone to do it
2011-02-02T13:57:00.000Z	nVee		hands down
2011-02-02T13:57:00.000Z	nVee		anyone who can log in and do it I will pay
2011-02-02T13:57:00.000Z	nVee		Ill pay upfront
2011-02-02T13:58:00.000Z	nVee		I am going to loose my job today because of this
2011-02-02T13:58:00.000Z	Gnea	nVee	this is on a production machine?
2011-02-02T13:59:00.000Z	Gnea	nVee	well yes, working with ubuntu in a professional sense certainly does require a level of knowledge of how the system works to begin with
2011-02-02T14:00:00.000Z	Gnea	nVee	also, my apologies if my comments seem insensitive, I just got on here, so I'm not entirely privvy to your entire situation
2011-02-02T14:01:00.000Z	nVee	Gnea	not at all, trust me, im done with ubuntu :) (or linux for that matter)
2011-02-02T14:01:00.000Z	Gnea	nVee	wow, giving up that easy? so sorry to hear that. :)
2011-02-02T14:02:00.000Z	Gnea	nVee	so what is it you're trying to do then? just obtain the data from an lvm?
2011-02-02T14:02:00.000Z	nVee	Gnea	yes, thats it, I just want to copy /var/www from the LVM filesystem, thats it, nothing else
2011-02-02T14:03:00.000Z	Gnea	nVee	ah okay. yes, the documentation on the website ought to point you in the right direction. one thing to keep in mind, also, is that some directories are not absolute, so if it isn't actually there, it might be elsewhere
2011-02-02T14:04:00.000Z	Gnea	nVee	out of curiosity, how long have you been attempting to work with ubuntu?
2011-02-02T14:07:00.000Z	nVee	Gnea	about a month or two
2011-02-02T14:07:00.000Z	Gnea	nVee	ah, well part of learning linux in general is learning how to fix it if it breaks
2011-02-02T14:07:00.000Z	Gnea	nVee	but if you've got time constraints, I can understand that too
2011-02-02T14:47:00.000Z	Gnea	nVee	glad you were able to follow through with it, and it's understandable... perhaps you may find another use for it and try it again sometime, or perhaps in your spare time at home... and if not, oh well, glad it worked :)
