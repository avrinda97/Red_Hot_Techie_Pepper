2006-08-01T16:04:00.000Z	pwnsey		Like a FTP drive
2006-08-01T16:06:00.000Z	pwnsey		I've tried to make a virtual drive using the "Connect to Server" under places.  However, When i do that, I am unable to open files using open office.  Is there any way I can mount a network FTP Drive?
2006-08-01T16:06:00.000Z	kimo	pwnsey	look at fuse maybe
2006-08-01T16:07:00.000Z	pwnsey		Kimo: Thanks I'll take a look.
2006-08-01T16:08:00.000Z	kimo	pwnsey	if u dont do that very often though  ... just copy the file back & forth ...... or use koffice?!
2006-08-01T16:08:00.000Z	pwnsey		Cal: Plan 9 stuff?
2006-08-01T16:09:00.000Z	pwnsey		Kimo: yeah i use it a lot, between a windows and linux computer.  Lots of documents going back and forth
2006-08-01T16:09:00.000Z	kimo	pwnsey	if it's a windows share, it can be mounted easily ..
2006-08-01T16:09:00.000Z	pwnsey		Its not, its a FTP server
2006-08-01T16:10:00.000Z	pwnsey		Kimo:  Its a ftp server.
2006-08-01T16:10:00.000Z	kimo	pwnsey	ok .. the only thing I can think of, is maybe fuse
