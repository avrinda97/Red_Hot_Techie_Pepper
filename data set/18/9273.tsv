2007-04-23T05:29:00.000Z	thebillywayne	chovy	you're using sudo dkpg-reconfigure xserver-xorg rigth?
2007-04-23T05:30:00.000Z	chovy		yes
2007-04-23T05:30:00.000Z	thebillywayne	chovy	then something bad wrong.
2007-04-23T05:30:00.000Z	chovy	thebillywayne	yes, obviously.
2007-04-23T05:30:00.000Z	chovy		all i did was upgrade.
2007-04-23T05:31:00.000Z	thebillywayne	chovy	did you upgrade via command line?
2007-04-23T05:31:00.000Z	chovy		f--ing linux
2007-04-23T05:31:00.000Z	chovy	thebillywayne	nope
2007-04-23T05:31:00.000Z	chovy		apt-manager
2007-04-23T05:31:00.000Z	thebillywayne	chovy	you didn't get any errors?
2007-04-23T05:31:00.000Z	thebillywayne	chovy	during upgrade ...
2007-04-23T05:32:00.000Z	chovy	thebillywayne	nope, it worked, but the screen size was wrong. I tried copying my xorg.conf over from my other box, and it gave me an error. The original xorg.conf is gone...so I need to re-configure it.
2007-04-23T05:33:00.000Z	thebillywayne	chovy	be sure you're spelling it correctly.  sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2007-04-23T05:34:00.000Z	chovy	thebillywayne	says xserver-xorg is not installed
2007-04-23T05:36:00.000Z	chovy	thebillywayne	says "no screens found" when I run startx
