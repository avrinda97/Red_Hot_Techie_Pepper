2007-03-26T08:38:00.000Z	Frog292		hello, does anyone know how i can fix packages.freecontrib.org timing out when i try to upgrade ubuntu from 6.06 to 6.10?
2007-03-26T08:39:00.000Z	ardchoille	Frog292	Last I hear they stopped the Ubuntu repo at freecontrib.
2007-03-26T08:49:00.000Z	ardchoille	Frog292	I told yo that freecontrib doesn't have an Ubuntu repo right now.
2007-03-26T08:49:00.000Z	ardchoille	Frog292	They are in the process of turning it over to new management, but it doesn't work right now.
2007-03-26T08:50:00.000Z	ardchoille	Frog292	You might as well comment out the freecontrib repos for now.
2007-03-26T08:50:00.000Z	ardchoille	Frog292	Do you have me on ignore?
2007-03-26T08:52:00.000Z	ardchoille	Frog292	pastebin your /etc/apt/sources.list file and I'll help with that
2007-03-26T08:55:00.000Z	Frog292	ardchoille	here it is http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/12095/
2007-03-26T08:55:00.000Z	ardchoille	Frog292	You use automatix?
2007-03-26T08:56:00.000Z	ardchoille	Frog292	Sorry, I can't help.
2007-03-26T08:57:00.000Z	ardchoille	Frog292	If it were me, I'd reinstall Ubuntu amd never touch automatix.
2007-03-26T08:59:00.000Z	ardchoille	Frog292	You can download the Edgy cd and install that. Then upgrade to Fesity when it comes out.
2007-03-26T09:01:00.000Z	ardchoille	Frog292	If you want to preserve your boot menu, copy the /boot/grub/menu.lst file to a usb key or burn it to cd or something, it's really easy to restore it later.
2007-03-26T09:02:00.000Z	ardchoille	Frog292	Copy that file to be in with the files you are backing up.
2007-03-26T09:03:00.000Z	ardchoille	Frog292	Well, that is an issue that is quickly and easily fixed.. with the gurus in this channel :)
2007-03-26T09:04:00.000Z	ardchoille	Frog292	Try xchat
2007-03-26T09:06:00.000Z	ardchoille	Frog292	Yes, those settings are for all the apps you use
2007-03-26T09:12:00.000Z	ardchoille	Frog292	Are you in gnome or kde?
