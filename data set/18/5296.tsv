2011-01-15T19:01:00.000Z	the_dark_warrio		I'm trying to access my brother's computer, which is a Windows 7. But Ubuntu keeps asking for a password, which was not the case 2 days ago. I'm trying to enter my brother's password but it is not working either. Any hints?
2011-01-15T19:02:00.000Z	spydon	the_dark_warrio	with which protocol are you trying to access his computer?
2011-01-15T19:03:00.000Z	the_dark_warrio	spydon	I think it is smb. I access by clicking in Places > Network, than I try to enter SPOCK, which is my brother's computer name.
2011-01-15T19:04:00.000Z	spydon	the_dark_warrio	are you sure he haven't changed the rights of the shared folders?
2011-01-15T19:05:00.000Z	the_dark_warrio	spydon	Yes, but hey, it's a windows =P . I've figured the problem was happening when I couldn't use the printer anymore, since it is shared from his Windows
2011-01-15T19:06:00.000Z	the_dark_warrio	spydon	I will try to configure his Windows a little bit more
2011-01-15T19:06:00.000Z	spydon	the_dark_warrio	can you access his computer with another windows computer?
2011-01-15T19:06:00.000Z	the_dark_warrio	spydon	Hmm, thats a nice thing to try. Let me see
2011-01-15T19:11:00.000Z	the_dark_warrio	spydon	I can access my bro's computer with a Windows Vista, without password
2011-01-15T19:11:00.000Z	spydon	the_dark_warrio	that's weird...
2011-01-15T19:12:00.000Z	the_dark_warrio	spydon	yep. I guess this started happening after a Windows Update, but I can't be sure
2011-01-15T19:20:00.000Z	spydon	the_dark_warrio	how do you access it, from nautilus? Have you tried in diffrent ways?
2011-01-15T19:21:00.000Z	the_dark_warrio	spydon	I've tried from nautilus in two ways: by double clicking on my brother's computer and by typing his ip address smb://<ip address> . In both ways nautilus asks his password
2011-01-15T19:22:00.000Z	spydon	the_dark_warrio	if you write smb://<ip address>/<folder> then?
2011-01-15T19:22:00.000Z	the_dark_warrio	spydon	I will try
2011-01-15T19:28:00.000Z	the_dark_warrio	spydon	no success either =P
2011-01-15T19:41:00.000Z	the_dark_warrio	spydon	thanks for you help! I will lurker a bit more. Cya
2011-01-15T19:42:00.000Z	spydon	the_dark_warrio	no problem, hope you solve it! C ya
