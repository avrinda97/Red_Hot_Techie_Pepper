2008-03-13T20:25:00.000Z	sebas891		hey folks! I've a problem installing ubuntu on laptop with a fancy chipset...  I'm trying to boot with noapic nolapic
2008-03-13T20:25:00.000Z	sebas891		no luck.
2008-03-13T20:25:00.000Z	sebas891		any idea? about other parameter.
2008-03-13T20:25:00.000Z	sebas891		s?
2008-03-13T20:25:00.000Z	smatt	sebas891	where does it stop?
2008-03-13T20:25:00.000Z	sebas891	smatt	 right after the usbcore stuff
2008-03-13T20:26:00.000Z	smatt	sebas891	have you tried disabling the module that it hangs on?
2008-03-13T20:27:00.000Z	sebas891	smatt	how can I know which module hangs ?
2008-03-13T20:27:00.000Z	smatt	sebas891	you said it hangs right after the usbcore stuff, have you tried disabling usb?
2008-03-13T20:31:00.000Z	sebas891	smatt	it was working with these parameters with 7.04... but now with 7.10 no luck.
2008-03-13T20:32:00.000Z	smatt		i'm using a turtlebeach usb audio and just installed ubuntu 7.1 last night. I launch firefox and install the flash player inside firefox, but i get no sound. i checked the sound properties and selected "usb" for everything and clicked test to make sure i heard something. i drop to shell and apt-get remove flashplugin-nonfree and then install it again. still no sound.
2008-03-13T20:33:00.000Z	smatt	sebas891	download an older version then just upgrade through apt
2008-03-13T20:34:00.000Z	smatt		no takers on the audio problem?
2008-03-13T20:35:00.000Z	sebas891	smatt	weird, I do not see any usb options to disable it.
2008-03-13T20:36:00.000Z	smatt	sebas891	in suse you would just type nousb as a parameter for boot option
2008-03-13T20:36:00.000Z	smatt	sebas891	i'm not sure what it would be for ubuntu, i'm new too :)
2008-03-13T20:36:00.000Z	sebas891	smatt	thanks for the hints :)
2008-03-13T20:37:00.000Z	smatt	sebas891	at least i'm trying to help... nobody wants to answer my question :)
