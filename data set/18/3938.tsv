2010-01-15T21:01:00.000Z	fission6		coool, can i do that from command line too?
2010-01-15T21:02:00.000Z	LjL	fission6	not with audacity
2010-01-15T21:02:00.000Z	fission6		well thats silly
2010-01-15T21:02:00.000Z	LjL	fission6	why? audacity is a GUI program.
2010-01-15T21:02:00.000Z	fission6		because i want to generate audio files in a unit test for python
2010-01-15T21:03:00.000Z	LjL	fission6	well, you didn't *say* that.
2010-01-15T21:03:00.000Z	fission6		haha i know
2010-01-15T21:03:00.000Z	fission6		ok sox is something we ar ealready use but wasnt away it could generate valid wavs / audio files
2010-01-15T21:06:00.000Z	LjL	fission6	"sox -n filename.wav" trim 0 <length-in-seconds> -t wav" looks like it might work
2010-01-15T21:06:00.000Z	fission6		woww cool let me try
2010-01-15T21:07:00.000Z	fission6		what is trim doing there
2010-01-15T21:07:00.000Z	LjL	fission6	trimming an empty file
2010-01-15T21:07:00.000Z	LjL	fission6	"-n" specifies that there is no actual input file
2010-01-15T21:08:00.000Z	LjL	fission6	if you prefer to have sound in it, look into the filter "synth" (man soxeffect)
