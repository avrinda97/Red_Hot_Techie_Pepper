2005-04-23T09:24:00.000Z	JosephSpiros		Hmm
2005-04-23T09:24:00.000Z	JosephSpiros		I've got a Dell Latitude C500/C600 and the Hoary live CD
2005-04-23T09:25:00.000Z	JosephSpiros		and it works fine with the built in display
2005-04-23T09:25:00.000Z	JosephSpiros		but if I try and use an external display, the external display stays blank, unless I open and close the laptop, and if I do that, the external display shows a blinking cursor
2005-04-23T09:25:00.000Z	JosephSpiros		not X
2005-04-23T09:27:00.000Z	JosephSpiros		so, does anyone have a suggestion for how I can get the Live CD working with a Dell Latitude C500/C600 and an external display
2005-04-23T09:27:00.000Z	sladen	JosephSpiros	does it have a CD ROM?
2005-04-23T09:27:00.000Z	JosephSpiros	sladen	of course ;p
2005-04-23T09:28:00.000Z	sladen	JosephSpiros	ah okay, it's about enableing the external monitor
2005-04-23T09:28:00.000Z	JosephSpiros	sladen	yes, it works fine if I boot it without the external display
2005-04-23T09:31:00.000Z	JosephSpiros	sladen	any suggestion?
2005-04-23T09:32:00.000Z	sladen	JosephSpiros	it appears to be a ROM image.  Generally I think those are highly undistributable.  Try  http://www.google.com/search?q=sp-s2.sp1
2005-04-23T09:32:00.000Z	JosephSpiros	sladen	???
2005-04-23T09:35:00.000Z	sladen	JosephSpiros	gngeo is an emulator for the NeoGeo game console.  It is a processor waiting for instructions.  sp-s2.sp1 contains the instrucstions used to boot the device (and therefore the emulator).  Those isntructions are copyright Nintendo and so cannot be redistributed by Ubuntu.
2005-04-23T09:36:00.000Z	JosephSpiros	sladen	What? I'm the guy with the problem regarding a Dell Latitude C600 and an external display :p
2005-04-23T09:36:00.000Z	sladen	JosephSpiros	sorry.
2005-04-23T09:40:00.000Z	sladen	JosephSpiros	I've been Googling, but haven't found an answer yet.  Depending on the chipset and laptop, they're be a program (eg. 'i810_switch') to switch the video output.  Or you may need to add something to xorg.conf---Have a Google and you'll likely find it faster than me
2005-04-23T09:41:00.000Z	sladen	JosephSpiros	after you've found the result, please add it to Bugzilla/etc so that other people can know aswell
