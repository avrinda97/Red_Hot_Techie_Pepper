2004-11-11T13:59:00.000Z	Nebu		Whenever I open a file with totem movie player, it crashes. Can anyone help me with this?
2004-11-11T13:59:00.000Z	Nebu		I've tried mp3s, mpgs, WMV. They all cause it to crash.
2004-11-11T14:00:00.000Z	Nebu		I tried opening the same mp3 with XMMS and it works fine there. I don't have a different movie player to test the other files with.
2004-11-11T14:02:00.000Z	michael315	Nebu	I see the prob. Tried the same ones with xine, they play fine. I have the win32 codecs installed also. Maybe try another?
2004-11-11T14:03:00.000Z	Nebu		Michael: I didn't understand. You want me to try another what?
2004-11-11T14:08:00.000Z	Nebu	Xethorn	I get an error message (which I will copy in a moment)
2004-11-11T14:08:00.000Z	Nebu	Xethorn	Package totem-xine is not available, but is referred to by another package.
2004-11-11T14:08:00.000Z	Nebu	Xethorn	This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or
2004-11-11T14:08:00.000Z	Nebu		is only available from another source
2004-11-11T14:09:00.000Z	michael315		Is universe enabled in your sources?
2004-11-11T14:09:00.000Z	Nebu		Michael: I don't know how to find out.
2004-11-11T14:10:00.000Z	michael315		then run apt-get update & then try for xine xine-ui
2004-11-11T14:11:00.000Z	Nebu		michael: I'd type "apt-get install xine xine-ui"?
2004-11-11T14:15:00.000Z	michael315	Nebu	yes
2004-11-11T14:15:00.000Z	Nebu		When I try to install totem-xine, it says it has to remove ubuntu-desktop as part of the process. That sort of sounds dangerous to me...
2004-11-11T14:16:00.000Z	michael315		Its just a small package, I have done that, no damage
2004-11-11T14:22:00.000Z	Nebu		Okay, totem isn't crashing anymore, but it's just displaying a blue screen instead of the video image. Where can I go for some codecs?
2004-11-11T14:26:00.000Z	michael315	Nebu	http://www1.mplayerhq.hu/homepage/design7/codecs.html I usually download the "all"
