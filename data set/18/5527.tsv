2008-10-06T08:08:00.000Z	FlyerFanatic		i am trying to boot ubuntu from a disk
2008-10-06T08:08:00.000Z	FlyerFanatic		and i'm getting this error message : (huge integer) I/O buffer on device fd0 logical block 0
2008-10-06T08:09:00.000Z	keppi	FlyerFanatic	 okay...
2008-10-06T08:09:00.000Z	keppi	FlyerFanatic	 maybe a bad disk?
2008-10-06T08:09:00.000Z	FlyerFanatic		i tried adding acpi=off and floppy=off to the bootline in the menu like some others told me to try here earlier
2008-10-06T08:09:00.000Z	FlyerFanatic		i burned it twice the second time at a slower speed
2008-10-06T08:10:00.000Z	keppi	FlyerFanatic	 bad download?  did you do a CRC?

2008-10-06T08:11:00.000Z	FlyerFanatic		the forums seem to have threads about this same problem...so it seems common
