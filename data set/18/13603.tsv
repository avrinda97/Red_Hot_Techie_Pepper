2006-05-21T06:00:00.000Z	jonuk		10GB /root primary partition
2006-05-21T06:00:00.000Z	jonuk		20GB /home logical partition
2006-05-21T06:01:00.000Z	jonuk		512MB /swap logical partition
2006-05-21T06:01:00.000Z	jonuk		and then I tried makin the remaining 220GB or whatever a FAT32 partition
2006-05-21T06:01:00.000Z	jonuk		but I got this error: "The attempt to mount a file system with type vfat in IDE1 master partition #3 /usr failed"
2006-05-21T06:02:00.000Z	jonuk		well, i wanted to use the rest as shared space between Windows and Linux
2006-05-21T06:02:00.000Z	jonuk		how big can fat32 be?
2006-05-21T06:03:00.000Z	jonuk		richie: i thought that was just filesize on a FAT32
2006-05-21T06:03:00.000Z	jonuk		file system size
2006-05-21T06:03:00.000Z	jonuk		i tried to make 220GB file system size
2006-05-21T06:05:00.000Z	Samuli^	jonuk	why would you want to do that?
2006-05-21T06:06:00.000Z	Samuli^	jonuk	o-kay., I guess it's about the only choice.
2006-05-21T06:10:00.000Z	Samuli^	jonuk	if you don't need to write to the hd, then ntfs is fine.
2006-05-21T06:11:00.000Z	Samuli^	jonuk	yeah.
2006-05-21T06:13:00.000Z	Samuli^	jonuk	you add that line to /etc/fstab so that it automatically mounts at boot.
2006-05-21T06:14:00.000Z	Samuli^	jonuk	sort of.. but it can be done pretty easily if you know what you're doing.
2006-05-24T06:30:00.000Z	Samuli^	jonuk	then you won't be able to write to it in linux
2006-05-24T06:30:00.000Z	Samuli^	jonuk	NTFS is a good choice then.
