2007-04-04T06:27:00.000Z	CoRnJuLiOx		ok, i'm using axel to download something, but the address i'm giving it has spaces, i tried canceling them out w/ backslashes and putting the address in quotes but it still doesn't find the site.
2007-04-04T06:27:00.000Z	CoRnJuLiOx		any ideas?
2007-04-04T06:28:00.000Z	ferret	CoRnJuLiOx	replace the spaces with %20
2007-04-04T06:30:00.000Z	CoRnJuLiOx	ferret	didn't work
2007-04-04T06:31:00.000Z	ferret	CoRnJuLiOx	Can you demonstrate what you are trying?
2007-04-04T06:31:00.000Z	CoRnJuLiOx	ferret	 axel -a http://radnorite.com/ddr/Cherry%20Step/Cherry%20Step.zip
2007-04-04T06:33:00.000Z	ferret	CoRnJuLiOx	That's some kind of weird bug... it doesn't support spaces in redirects
2007-04-04T06:34:00.000Z	ferret	CoRnJuLiOx	so remove the redirect: axel 'http://media-nf.radnorite.com/ddr/Cherry%20Step/Cherry%20Step.zip'
2007-04-04T06:34:00.000Z	CoRnJuLiOx	ferret	ok
2007-04-04T06:34:00.000Z	ferret	CoRnJuLiOx	(Is that a song pack?  Is it decent?)
2007-04-04T06:35:00.000Z	CoRnJuLiOx	ferret	yeah its a song pack. i dunno how decent it is. the site i'm downloading from has 4 servers up, each w/a 60kbps downstream cap on it, thats why i'm trying to get axel working
2007-04-04T06:35:00.000Z	CoRnJuLiOx	ferret	the link you gave me didn't work
2007-04-04T06:35:00.000Z	ferret	CoRnJuLiOx	That's bizarre, it works perfectly fine here.
2007-04-04T06:35:00.000Z	ferret	CoRnJuLiOx	Try using wget to start downloading, ^C it, then use the link it gives you (=> http://something)
2007-04-04T06:36:00.000Z	CoRnJuLiOx	ferret	can wget pull a single file from multiple sources?
2007-04-04T06:36:00.000Z	CoRnJuLiOx	ferret	i never did figure out how to do that
2007-04-04T06:36:00.000Z	ferret	CoRnJuLiOx	No... I'm not suggesting you use wget to get the file, just to do the http redirect stuff
2007-04-04T06:37:00.000Z	CoRnJuLiOx	ferret	example? i don't know how to do that >.<
