2010-10-21T02:25:00.000Z	p3nsi0n3r	X-Sleepy-X	 thanks mate, ill have a look
2010-10-21T02:25:00.000Z	X-Sleepy-X	p3nsi0n3r	you would probably want the driver for "LINUX driver for kernel 2.6.x and 2.4.x (Support x86 and x64)"
2010-10-21T02:25:00.000Z	X-Sleepy-X	p3nsi0n3r	not sure if you'll get anything going with this though...
