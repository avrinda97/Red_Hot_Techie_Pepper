2008-08-30T00:32:00.000Z	rwaite		ugh. i took my laptop apart and put it back together and now my wifi won't work... >:| the card is detected fine, but it does not see any AP's
2008-08-30T00:33:00.000Z	rwaite		i mustve messed something up
2008-08-30T00:33:00.000Z	bofh80	rwaite	you sure you didn't disconnect the little aerials attached to the wifi card?
2008-08-30T00:33:00.000Z	rwaite	bofh80	the antennas? i did, but i put them back. now it isnt working. doesnt make much sense
2008-08-30T00:34:00.000Z	rwaite		unless i shorted the card out, but then i dont think it would be detected
2008-08-30T00:34:00.000Z	bofh80	rwaite	where you sure to check they pushed on correctly(they are little buggers), and in the same order you took them off?
2008-08-30T00:35:00.000Z	rwaite		they are labelled, so i think? and i pushed them on till they clicked... unless that's not good enough?
2008-08-30T00:36:00.000Z	bofh80	rwaite	that should be fine really. did you use a static band or touch a radiator to gound yourself every once in a while, as you were doing this?
2008-08-30T00:36:00.000Z	rwaite		no
2008-08-30T00:36:00.000Z	rwaite		i know, stupid mistake
2008-08-30T00:37:00.000Z	rwaite	bofh80	but the reason i took it apart was i got shocked while using it. so i was investigating the source of the shock
2008-08-30T00:37:00.000Z	bofh80	rwaite	LOL. probably spilt something, or maybe the speakers . . .
2008-08-30T00:39:00.000Z	bofh80	rwaite	my only advise would be to reseat the card and the antanie again. :S but ground your self by touching a radiotor every minute or so
2008-08-30T00:40:00.000Z	rwaite		i might just buy a new laptop
2008-08-30T00:40:00.000Z	rwaite		this thing is like 2 years old anyway
2008-08-30T00:40:00.000Z	bofh80	rwaite	LOL. cool. you can send me that one then. heheheh.
2008-08-30T00:40:00.000Z	rwaite		50 bucks and its yours
2008-08-30T00:41:00.000Z	bofh80	rwaite	i'm gussing it would cost that much in shipping - hahahahah
