2011-12-16T12:06:00.000Z	guest-VGOYUi		Hi. I downloaded the 11.10 live cd, and upon startup, all i get is a screen with options to install, recover etc. I never see the option to "try it". have i downloaded the wrong iso?
2011-12-16T12:07:00.000Z	sattu94	guest-VGOYUi	Possibly, what exactly are the options?
2011-12-16T12:08:00.000Z	sattu94	guest-VGOYUi	what is the iso called ?
2011-12-16T12:09:00.000Z	sattu94	guest-VGOYUi	that's all ?
2011-12-16T12:10:00.000Z	sattu94	guest-VGOYUi	i'm asking about the .iso file dyou downloaded, not the CD.
2011-12-16T12:12:00.000Z	sattu94	guest-VGOYUi	try running the Install Ubuntu option from the liveCD, if it spawns a nice gfxical envronment then it should be  a desktop one, if not ,it might be an alternate or server CD. abort the installation before you reach the disk partitioner.
2011-12-16T12:14:00.000Z	sattu94	guest-VGOYUi	also, only desktop CDs have Try Ubuntu option..
2011-12-16T12:16:00.000Z	sattu94	guest-VGOYUi	yes, you dont need a reinstall, just find out what CD you have.
2011-12-16T12:18:00.000Z	sattu94	guest-VGOYUi	you have the desktop, see! :D...
2011-12-16T12:18:00.000Z	sattu94	guest-VGOYUi	It should have the try ubuntu option.
2011-12-16T12:19:00.000Z	sattu94	guest-VGOYUi	You'll get the try ubuntu option only when you boot from the live CD.
2011-12-16T12:20:00.000Z	sattu94	guest-VGOYUi	You will NOT get it if you boot to GRUB or an already installed system.
2011-12-16T12:21:00.000Z	sattu94	guest-VGOYUi	yes, possibly.
2011-12-16T12:23:00.000Z	sattu94	guest-VGOYUi	No, it's not what you think it is, I thought you wanted to boot to a live environment right ?
2011-12-16T12:24:00.000Z	sattu94	guest-VGOYUi	Why do you want to boot to a liveCD when u already have an installed system ?
2011-12-16T12:26:00.000Z	sattu94	guest-VGOYUi	your current user is guest, what happened to the user created during installation ?
2011-12-16T12:28:00.000Z	sattu94	guest-VGOYUi	what user did you use in the recovery mode /
2011-12-16T12:29:00.000Z	sattu94	guest-VGOYUi	okay, so did u try sudo passwd root ?
