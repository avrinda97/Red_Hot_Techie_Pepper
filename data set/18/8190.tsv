2008-04-23T21:00:00.000Z	j2daosh		there has to be a space
2008-04-23T21:00:00.000Z	j2daosh		hmm...
2008-04-23T21:01:00.000Z	j2daosh		dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg doesn't work, says "need an action option"

2008-04-23T21:04:00.000Z	j2daosh		got it working, what driver? it doesn't have intel listed
2008-04-23T21:05:00.000Z	j2daosh		is there a package i need to get?
2008-04-23T21:06:00.000Z	j2daosh		yeah the i810 driver, but thats the one i am already using and its incorrect
2008-04-23T21:06:00.000Z	j2daosh		i think i will try with the nv driver and see what happens
2008-04-23T21:08:00.000Z	j2daosh		nope, its just a generic intel onboard
