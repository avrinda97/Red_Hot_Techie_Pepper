2009-03-20T19:09:00.000Z	sellout_	Deevz	root is / that is your base directory for everything. That is also what all your applications are going to be isntalld to in subfolders spread out ofer bin, sbin, var, opt. etc.
2009-03-20T19:10:00.000Z	sellout_	Deevz	so head up to wal-mart and grab a 16 gig usb stick for 30$ and solve your problem ;-)
