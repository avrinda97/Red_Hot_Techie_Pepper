2011-10-05T16:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	norbert79	have you asked in #winehq too
2011-10-05T16:58:00.000Z	norbert79	ActionParsnip	Well, question isn't really based on Wine, could be any application
2011-10-05T16:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	norbert79	but any app in wine, right?
2011-10-05T16:58:00.000Z	norbert79	ActionParsnip	No
2011-10-05T16:59:00.000Z	norbert79	ActionParsnip	Basically I was merely looking for a methodf controlling font hinting appl,ication based
2011-10-05T16:59:00.000Z	norbert79	ActionParsnip	ANY application
2011-10-05T16:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	norbert79	ah, I see. You just mentioned wine and it seemed to relate purely to that
2011-10-05T16:59:00.000Z	norbert79	ActionParsnip	I see. No, wasn't really the goal
2011-10-05T16:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	norbert79	np man, its clear now
2011-10-05T17:03:00.000Z	norbert79	ActionParsnip	Since of your silence I can assume you have no ideas either :)
2011-10-05T17:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	norbert79	correct, I have no idea of fonts, never had an issue (either that or I simply don't care about 'ugly' fonts)
2011-10-05T17:04:00.000Z	norbert79	ActionParsnip	I see... Thank you though :)
