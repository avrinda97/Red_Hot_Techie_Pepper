2010-06-09T23:48:00.000Z	iceroot	ubutom_	never do that!!!!
2010-06-09T23:48:00.000Z	iceroot	ubutom_	now the wholeworld can see your private ssh-key and so on
2010-06-09T23:49:00.000Z	ubutom_	iceroot	no, was a previous install
2010-06-09T23:51:00.000Z	ubutom_	iceroot	MPX, maybe he could just change the security-critical ones?
2010-06-09T23:53:00.000Z	ubutom_	iceroot	MPX or maybe creating another user and moving the needed stuff back, by that way the folders will have the right permissions for the new user, the content maybe not :(
2010-06-10T00:02:00.000Z	ubutom_	iceroot	will sudo chown -r MPX:MPX /home/MPX for example reset the permissions to something healthier or will it stay 777?
2010-06-10T00:02:00.000Z	iceroot	ubutom_	chown is chaging the owner, not the permission
2010-06-10T00:04:00.000Z	ubutom_	iceroot	MPX hhm, but when you move configuration stuff from the old user over to the new, it will still have the wrong permissions, no?
2010-06-10T00:05:00.000Z	iceroot	ubutom_	yes, still 777
2010-06-10T00:06:00.000Z	ubutom_	iceroot	ok, but it could be possible to set the permissions to something saner like 644 or something
2010-06-10T00:06:00.000Z	iceroot	ubutom_	you have to know for every file the correct permission
2010-06-10T00:07:00.000Z	ubutom_	iceroot	okay, but by doing something like that one could at least fix the security issues :)
2010-06-10T00:08:00.000Z	iceroot	ubutom_	sure, as i said you have to know all permissions or a getfacl backup
2010-06-10T00:12:00.000Z	iceroot	ubutom_	look at setfacl
2010-06-10T01:02:00.000Z	ubutom_	iceroot	just did a successful test with getfacl and setfacl, nice to know! :)
2010-06-10T01:03:00.000Z	ubutom_	iceroot	created a folder and subfolders and a textfile in the folder, saved permissions and restored them, neat
2010-06-10T18:48:00.000Z	ubutom_	iceroot	thought the channel was more for server related issues than here, could be mistaken, never was there;)
2010-06-10T18:49:00.000Z	iceroot	ubutom_	ah yes, you are right but the software is the same, just another focus on support/questions
