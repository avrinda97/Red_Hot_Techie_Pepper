2005-09-25T14:28:00.000Z	dazzed		i have a question for anyone that can solve this complex trivia....all my internet applications (limewire, gaim, irssi...etc) work just fine EXCEPT mozilla firefox...i find i have to disable and enable the lan connection on the host computer (winblows machine) for web browsing to work...this is on all computers on the network not just nix machines
2005-09-25T14:30:00.000Z	dazzed		so its not the os its the connection between the computers and the sharing
2005-09-25T14:31:00.000Z	dazzed		please if you dont know what your talking about please just keep quiet
2005-09-25T14:32:00.000Z	dazzed		hehe
2005-09-25T14:33:00.000Z	shrike__	dazzed	can you ping using dns names before you disable/enable?
2005-09-25T14:33:00.000Z	dazzed	shrike__	yes
2005-09-25T14:35:00.000Z	dazzed	shrike__	when i ping...it only returns one ping
2005-09-25T14:36:00.000Z	shrike__	dazzed	ehh? thats a little strange
2005-09-25T14:36:00.000Z	dazzed	shrike__	your telling me
2005-09-25T14:37:00.000Z	shrike__	dazzed	I have had problems with ipv6 in firefox but this seems unrelated..this is accross win and unix machines?
2005-09-25T14:37:00.000Z	dazzed	shrike__	yes
2005-09-25T14:38:00.000Z	shrike__	dazzed	what kind of router?
2005-09-25T14:38:00.000Z	dazzed	shrike__	it has nix on the box...but i use windows since its my sisters computer and she is computer illeterate
2005-09-25T14:38:00.000Z	dazzed	shrike__	Dlink
2005-09-25T14:38:00.000Z	dazzed	shrike__	i use the router to connect to my laptop...and my laptop ddials up and everything is just fine web browsing pinging and all
2005-09-25T14:40:00.000Z	shrike__	dazzed	does this happen only when it goes from your sister using windows to you booting *nx or vis-versa?
2005-09-25T14:40:00.000Z	shrike__	dazzed	other words if it is windows and you reboot do you have the problem
2005-09-25T14:41:00.000Z	shrike__	dazzed	win- reboot to win
