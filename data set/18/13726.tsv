2005-11-02T07:51:00.000Z	Ropechoborra		Need help for the configuration of a modem!
2005-11-02T07:51:00.000Z	Cashel	Ropechoborra	I suggest prayer.. :)
2005-11-02T07:51:00.000Z	Cashel	Ropechoborra	been awhile since I've done it.. what kind of modem do you have?
2005-11-02T07:52:00.000Z	Ropechoborra	Cashel	an onboard one (PC Chips P4 mother)
2005-11-02T07:53:00.000Z	Cashel	Ropechoborra	I'll see if I can find anything about weather its supported, but I'm doubting it..
2005-11-02T07:54:00.000Z	Ropechoborra	Cashel	Ok... Ill do it when i reboot my pc (im not in linux) but why is that? why cant recognice all modems ??
2005-11-02T07:55:00.000Z	Cashel	Ropechoborra	some modems arent real modem but "winmodems" which means they are missing an important piece of hardware.. some such modems have linux compatible drivers, but not all..
2005-11-02T07:55:00.000Z	Cashel	Ropechoborra	http://www.linmodems.org/  go there, and try their scanmodem tool
2005-11-02T07:56:00.000Z	Ropechoborra	Cashel	Thanks!
2005-11-02T07:56:00.000Z	Cashel	Ropechoborra	if you have a serial or usb modem (or just a real old modem) laying around, you'll be better off..
2005-11-02T08:03:00.000Z	Ropechoborra	Cashel	si i download wvdial and install it, the run wvdialconf to see if my modem works ?
2005-11-02T08:04:00.000Z	Cashel	Ropechoborra	I dont know anything at all about wvdial
2005-11-02T08:06:00.000Z	Ropechoborra	Cashel	Ive found this scanModem. I have to install it, execute it and then it gives me a report?
2005-11-02T08:06:00.000Z	Cashel	Ropechoborra	I guess, I never used it
2005-11-02T08:07:00.000Z	Cashel	Ropechoborra	you need to determin what chipset the modem uses to know if it will work... also you may just try using /dev/ttyS0 (for com1, S1 for com 2, etc) in wvdial or whatever to see if it maybe works already
2005-11-02T08:08:00.000Z	Ropechoborra	Cashel	ive tryed that already... Doesnt work... ill try with this scanModem.. :)
2005-11-02T08:09:00.000Z	Ropechoborra	Cashel	Other thing.... Got this ntfs partition... It is only mounted as "Read Only" isnt any other way?
2005-11-02T08:10:00.000Z	Cashel	Ropechoborra	nope, there is not NTFS support for write in linux yet.. they are working on it tho..
