2010-12-28T19:02:00.000Z	pw-toxic		e software/hardware crashes and i can give access to all of the files to my mom. What do you think about this backup hierarchy?
2010-12-28T19:03:00.000Z	needhelp1	pw-toxic	what are you wanting to do
2010-12-28T19:05:00.000Z	needhelp1	pw-toxic	just give your mom access to the actual files and not the back up
2010-12-28T19:06:00.000Z	pw-toxic	needhelp1	i give my mom access /read/Write to the files on the file server.. my mom ONLY stores her files on the fileserver.. but ADDITIONALLY she can access the backup if she overwrote an important file although she needs the older version
2010-12-28T19:06:00.000Z	needhelp1	pw-toxic	you cant fully protect against stupidity
2010-12-28T19:07:00.000Z	pw-toxic	needhelp1	why not?
2010-12-28T19:07:00.000Z	pw-toxic	needhelp1	if i tell my samba that she cant delete backup files then she cant do anything wrong
2010-12-28T19:07:00.000Z	pw-toxic	needhelp1	no backInTime does not overwrite anything
2010-12-28T19:07:00.000Z	pw-toxic	needhelp1	backInTime holds version of EVERY HOUR of all files using rsync
2010-12-28T19:07:00.000Z	pw-toxic	needhelp1	no thats not true
2010-12-28T19:08:00.000Z	pw-toxic	needhelp1	im using BackInTime for myself for 1-2 years now i guess
2010-12-28T19:08:00.000Z	needhelp1	pw-toxic	not to intrude but does your mom have any disabilitys
2010-12-28T19:09:00.000Z	pw-toxic	needhelp1	my mom is 55 years old and she is not familiar with computer - thats all
2010-12-28T19:10:00.000Z	needhelp1	pw-toxic	there could be alternatives
2010-12-28T19:11:00.000Z	needhelp1	pw-toxic	how much space are you using with the fileserver and backintime
2010-12-28T19:13:00.000Z	pw-toxic	needhelp1	we are talking about <50GB files.. but VERY MANY small files. The file server will have a raid1 conststing of 2*1TB wester digital green power
2010-12-28T19:14:00.000Z	needhelp1	pw-toxic	next time you buy externals look into seagate, they last longer
2010-12-28T19:14:00.000Z	pw-toxic	needhelp1	hm i have read something about that wester digital and seagte are quite similiar concerning this
