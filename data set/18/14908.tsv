2008-01-07T18:54:00.000Z	sint		hey, someone knows about madwifi cards? yesterday someone helped me to start the card but today i restarted the computer and its not working at all. there is even no such ath0 device.
2008-01-07T18:55:00.000Z	sint		which modules i have to load for madwifi? ath_pci?
2008-01-07T18:56:00.000Z	whyameye	sint	I think it is ath_pci
2008-01-07T18:57:00.000Z	sint	whyameye	ok, than its seem the module is kinda broken
2008-01-07T18:57:00.000Z	whyameye	sint	would it help you to look at your history of commands from yesterday?
2008-01-07T18:58:00.000Z	sint	whyameye	i've tried to use the commands from yesterday, but they did nothing
2008-01-07T19:00:00.000Z	whyameye	sint	did you build madwifi yesterday?
2008-01-07T19:00:00.000Z	sint	whyameye	i have compiled it, if you mean this. i was just using the stuff from apt
2008-01-07T19:04:00.000Z	sint	whyameye	i think i need the ath_hal
2008-01-07T19:05:00.000Z	sint	whyameye	i'm back in a minute, i'll try something
2008-01-07T19:11:00.000Z	sint	whyameye	back
2008-01-07T19:12:00.000Z	sint	whyameye	i got it to work. the module was not correct build due to the fact i've put it in restricted_modules conf file
2008-01-07T19:12:00.000Z	whyameye	sint	cool. Glad you are all set.
2008-01-07T19:12:00.000Z	sint	whyameye	don't know why, but i think there was a tutorial, i was trying yesterday which told me to
2008-01-07T19:13:00.000Z	sint	whyameye	i wonder if its possible to be online with eth0 and ath0 at the same time. right now i can only choose one of them with wicd
2008-01-07T19:14:00.000Z	whyameye	sint	sorry. Not sure.
2008-01-07T19:14:00.000Z	sint	whyameye	ok, no problem
2008-01-07T19:14:00.000Z	sint	whyameye	thanks for help anyway :)
