2010-03-01T07:13:00.000Z	enav		when you say find a channel operator.. you mean here or some website?
2010-03-01T07:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	enav	 its proberly registered nicks only
2010-10-13T21:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	enav	 depends on the chipset of the cards.
2010-10-13T21:45:00.000Z	enav	Dr_Willis	well i got 1 ATI and 1 nvidia  and 3 displays
2010-10-13T21:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	enav	 ive heard it can be done.. but only seen 1 person ever in this channel that was doing it.
2010-10-13T21:47:00.000Z	enav	Dr_Willis	windows works fine with the 2 cars  but linux disable the nvidia
2010-10-13T21:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	enav	 no idea. he was in here a few days back. It will also depend on how new the cards are.. a lot of the ati cards are not supported by the fglrx drivers any more.
2010-10-13T21:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	enav	 you did install the nvidia drivers for that card?
2010-10-13T21:48:00.000Z	enav	Dr_Willis	i got 2 drivers on the driverJokey list... ATI is working and nvidia show me the ubuntu logo
2010-10-13T21:49:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	enav	 all i can do is suggest checking the forums.
2010-12-30T06:24:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	enav	 use some tool like unetbootin, or lili, or the usb-disk cerator tool and add a persstant save file.. or just do a normal install to the flash drive.
2010-12-30T06:26:00.000Z	enav	Dr_Willis	i did the persistant data on the USB device but every time i restart the pc it show me the Live or install menu.... i whis to use my usb as a portable Disck and go to any computer i desire
2010-12-30T06:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	enav	 so. if you seelct live.. it should have the changes you did saved..
2010-12-30T06:27:00.000Z	enav	Dr_Willis	 changes like plugins  email paswords an all that stuff????
2010-12-30T06:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	enav	 yes. it has a persstant 'home' and 'system' file it keeps changes to.
2010-12-30T06:28:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	enav	 but a 'full' install to a flash drive may be more flexiable and faster
2010-12-30T06:30:00.000Z	enav	Dr_Willis	that sounds nice but im worry about the system compatibility... i want to plug the same usb device in 4 diferent computers
2010-12-30T06:33:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	enav	 then stick with a persistant save. and dont install any extra drivers.. but hope the default drivers work for nvidia/ati ssytems
