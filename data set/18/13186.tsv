2006-03-06T16:08:00.000Z	cello_rasp		I think it would be awesome if you could get universe and multivers on cd as well.. maybe a few dvds like debian
2006-03-06T16:09:00.000Z	cello_rasp		not really, i know people without connections that could do with ubuntu
2006-03-06T16:10:00.000Z	cello_rasp		Bratche: becasue Ubuntu has significantly better hardware support (it is true!) and gnome acts exactly the same :)
2006-03-06T16:10:00.000Z	cello_rasp		althought win98 was the best of the windows series before XP
2006-03-06T16:10:00.000Z	Stormx2	cello_rasp	Win2K ftw
2006-03-06T16:11:00.000Z	cello_rasp	Stormx2	haha 98sp was a missiove improvemtn and much better that the terrible implementation of NT as on 2K
2006-03-06T16:19:00.000Z	Stormx2	cello_rasp	Universe Modules?
2006-03-06T16:20:00.000Z	cello_rasp	Stormx2	ubuntu doesnt conme with mp3 support right off, you have to install them as well: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/HowToEnableTheMultiverseRepositoryInUbuntu?action=show
2006-03-06T16:20:00.000Z	Stormx2	cello_rasp	I know that. I have MP3 support
2006-03-06T16:21:00.000Z	Stormx2	cello_rasp	Turns out i need to install k3b-mp3... genius lol
2006-03-06T16:21:00.000Z	cello_rasp	Stormx2	cool
2006-03-06T16:28:00.000Z	Stormx2	cello_rasp	When the damned thing works >.<
2006-03-06T16:28:00.000Z	Stormx2	cello_rasp	You ever used IEs4Linux? That pwnz n00bz
2006-03-06T16:29:00.000Z	Stormx2	cello_rasp	This app downloads and installs one or more of IE 5, IE 5.5 and IE 6. Emulates Win2K too so it looks pretty sweet, works flawlessly, and doesn't change your current wine settings
2006-03-06T16:31:00.000Z	Stormx2	cello_rasp	You ever used GNOMAD2?
2006-03-06T16:33:00.000Z	Stormx2	cello_rasp	I once deleted all my icons >.<
