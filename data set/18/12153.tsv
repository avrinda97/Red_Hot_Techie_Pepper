2006-05-23T05:20:00.000Z	ompaul	alsa	I don't do samba (yet, as I live on a totally linux network)  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SettingUpSamba has both server and client side samba solutions
2006-05-23T05:21:00.000Z	ompaul	alsa	you are using the version from october so the number is 5.10 :-) there is no 5.1 that would be january :)
2006-05-23T05:21:00.000Z	ompaul	alsa	even worse it would be 5.01 :)
2006-05-23T05:22:00.000Z	ompaul	alsa	anyway  this works or we would have people saying it was faulty every day https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SettingUpSamba << just go through the steps cutting and pasting one at a time
2006-05-23T05:22:00.000Z	alsa	ompaul	i got it !
2006-05-23T05:35:00.000Z	alsa	ompaul	 i love u bro
2006-05-23T05:35:00.000Z	ompaul	alsa	its a community thing :)

2006-06-01T14:54:00.000Z	alsa	ompaul	do u know how to copy a file from an ssh session to localhost?
2006-06-01T14:57:00.000Z	ompaul	alsa	there are two ways to do that sftp which works like ftp and scp which is secure copy http://www.openssh.com/faq.html is fairly useful
