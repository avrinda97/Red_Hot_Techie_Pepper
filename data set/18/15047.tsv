2005-05-13T05:13:00.000Z	anto9us	hutch	you need samba installed for starters
2005-05-13T05:15:00.000Z	hutch	anto9us	ik that, but its kinda wierd to go up and ask him "hey...u running 2003 or 2000 on ur server"
2005-05-13T05:16:00.000Z	hutch	anto9us	i've tried to look online...but really to no avail
2005-05-13T05:16:00.000Z	anto9us	hutch	do you know the name of the domain or workgroup?
2005-05-13T05:16:00.000Z	anto9us	hutch	you could just try and join it
2005-05-13T05:17:00.000Z	hutch	anto9us	i mapped it when i had M$ usin a cmd prompt and "net use M: \\thor.heidelberg.edu" if that helps
2005-05-13T05:18:00.000Z	hutch	anto9us	and just used my login for the network (along with my pw)
2005-05-13T05:18:00.000Z	anto9us	hutch	that machine may already be part of the domain, a trusted machine
2005-05-13T05:18:00.000Z	hutch	anto9us	sorry if i seem a bit slow, i'm a total noob at linux...i just installed it yesterday cuz i was getting pissed at all the viruses/adware i was getting with my M$ comp
2005-05-13T05:19:00.000Z	hutch	anto9us	 how can i see if it is a "trusted machine"
2005-05-13T05:20:00.000Z	anto9us	hutch	I hear you on that one, only way to see if it's trusted is to look in directory thingy on the server
