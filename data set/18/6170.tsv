2008-07-16T21:05:00.000Z	Xavura	legend2440	Thank you, I have been searching Google for something like that on ubuntu.com
2008-07-16T21:07:00.000Z	Xavura	legend2440	So I should be using the open-source ATI driver, which one is that? Is it just "ati"?

2008-07-16T21:10:00.000Z	Xavura	legend2440	I'll go have a read, thanks
2008-07-16T21:11:00.000Z	Xavura	legend2440	I'm sorry but you keep pointing to me to things I have tried, I have tried "ati" (open-source ATI), "radeon" and "aiglx", "vesa" and "fglrx" (proprietary ATI)
2008-07-16T21:11:00.000Z	Xavura	legend2440	I'll give them all another try
2008-07-16T21:12:00.000Z	legend2440	Xavura	sorry i have ati Radeon using fglrx. no experience with "ati" driver  have you tried channel  #ati
2008-07-16T21:12:00.000Z	Xavura	legend2440	The link you gave me says fglrx is the proprietary ATI driver so you are using the proprietary ATI driver
2008-07-16T21:13:00.000Z	legend2440	Xavura	yes but mine is radeon 9600  the 7000 can't use those i don't think
2008-07-16T21:14:00.000Z	Xavura	legend2440	Correct
2008-07-16T21:14:00.000Z	legend2440	Xavura	so you have read this ?  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RadeonDriver
2008-07-16T21:14:00.000Z	Xavura	legend2440	Yes it says I can't use it
2008-07-16T21:15:00.000Z	Xavura	legend2440	It also says I can't use fglrx
