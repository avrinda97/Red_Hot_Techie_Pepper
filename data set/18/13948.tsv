2005-10-01T09:57:00.000Z	DavidLeeRoth		can anyone here help me with a mobo/atx case issue
2005-10-01T09:57:00.000Z	Crys_Win	DavidLeeRoth	what's the issue?
2005-10-01T09:58:00.000Z	Crys_Win	DavidLeeRoth	What form-factor is your motherboard?
2005-10-01T10:01:00.000Z	Crys_Win	DavidLeeRoth	I see the motherboard. What's the problem exactly?
2005-10-01T10:03:00.000Z	Crys_Win	DavidLeeRoth	I don't see any reason it wouldn't fit. Have you actually got it and been trying it in cases?
2005-10-01T10:06:00.000Z	Crys_Win	DavidLeeRoth	You need to check that other window. I typed to you.
2005-10-01T10:15:00.000Z	Crys_Win	DavidLeeRoth	Man, if you really wanna know the answer you show it wierd.
2005-10-01T10:44:00.000Z	Crys_Win	DavidLeeRoth	 look me in the face as I say this.
2005-10-01T10:46:00.000Z	Crys_Win	DavidLeeRoth	If you've never built a computer, you haven't come across this, but in my experience, the plate in the back comes off and a new one comes with your mobo.
2005-10-01T10:46:00.000Z	Crys_Win	DavidLeeRoth	does that solve the problem?
2005-10-01T10:48:00.000Z	Crys_Win	DavidLeeRoth	I'm not calling you dumb, dude, chill. I'm just trying to help. There are screws and it comes off, and the plate comes with the mobo. Somebody back me up please?
2005-10-01T10:51:00.000Z	Crys_Win	DavidLeeRoth	My mobo has a very similar plate. Also wouldn't go into the stock plate, but asus sent me a nice custom fit one in the box.
2005-10-01T10:53:00.000Z	Crys_Win	DavidLeeRoth	Don't hate your life. That case and that motherboard will work I think. That's gonna be a badass box. Do you have a gfx card picked out yet?
2005-10-01T10:54:00.000Z	Crys_Win	DavidLeeRoth	Fooken sweet. What are you gonna do with such a hardcore setup on linux. That's not a programmers box. You got wine and cedega in mind? A little bang bang? Some rpg?
2005-10-01T10:56:00.000Z	Crys_Win	DavidLeeRoth	What's vista? Never heard of that one. (simultaneously googling it.)
2005-10-01T10:57:00.000Z	Crys_Win	DavidLeeRoth	Holy crap! A windows I know nothing about!!!
2005-10-01T10:59:00.000Z	Crys_Win	DavidLeeRoth	Christ, what is it? Dude, what is vista? The website is vague and with only mild promise of getting less so.
2005-10-01T11:01:00.000Z	Crys_Win	DavidLeeRoth	With tech specs like that, it is sink.
