2004-10-23T06:01:00.000Z	tck		i've been having problems
2004-10-23T06:01:00.000Z	aitrus	tck	no.  no one responded and i'm still googling
2004-10-23T06:01:00.000Z	tck		i think there was one or two known issues regarding usb
2004-10-23T06:01:00.000Z	tck		whats dmesg say when u put it in
2004-10-23T06:02:00.000Z	aitrus		nothing
2004-10-23T06:02:00.000Z	tck		what else is there besides sda ?
2004-10-23T06:02:00.000Z	aitrus		what do you mean?
2004-10-23T06:03:00.000Z	aitrus		hmm... there we go
2004-10-23T06:03:00.000Z	tck		well is there any other sd [b-d]  appearing
2004-10-23T06:03:00.000Z	aitrus	tck	apparently it doesn't work if i use the front panel usb
2004-10-23T06:03:00.000Z	tck		ahh , and it works at the back
2004-10-23T06:03:00.000Z	tck		shit i might try that too :)
2004-10-23T06:04:00.000Z	aitrus	tck	but if i use the usb-hub on my keyboard (which is plugged into the back) it works
2004-10-23T06:05:00.000Z	tck		nope - don't work
2004-10-23T06:05:00.000Z	tck		i checked to see if it works under mdk 10 and it does, so it's not the usb key
2004-10-23T06:06:00.000Z	aitrus	tck	there is an issue in kernel 2.6.8.1 that is fixed by a patch
