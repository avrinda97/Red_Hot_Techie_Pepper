2006-09-04T13:03:00.000Z	anon32		this is probably the wrong place to ask, but how can I flash my bios?
2006-09-04T13:04:00.000Z	anon32		pronoob: zzz....
2006-09-04T13:04:00.000Z	anon32		though I recommend a new CPU
2006-09-04T13:05:00.000Z	anon32		boot to either ubuntu or a dos cd and format over it
2006-09-04T13:06:00.000Z	anon32		more swap is useless, get MORE RAM
2006-09-04T13:07:00.000Z	anon32		ukmatt: yes, there's a command line package manager
2006-09-04T13:09:00.000Z	anon32		uh, what kernel version is included on the 6.x dapper drake cds?
2006-09-04T13:10:00.000Z	anon32		thanks, I thought it was a 2.4 kernel
2006-09-04T13:10:00.000Z	anon32		mm... the only problem I've ever noticed with windows is a lack of preinstalled software
2006-09-04T13:11:00.000Z	anon32		um, how do I get access to iptables config?
2006-09-04T13:11:00.000Z	eod_punk	anon32	good preinstalled or bad preinstalled software?
2006-09-04T13:11:00.000Z	anon32		preferably from the gui?
2006-09-04T13:11:00.000Z	anon32	eod_punk	good point, :-\
2006-09-04T13:11:00.000Z	anon32		too much junk on these latest dells
2006-09-04T13:11:00.000Z	anon32		where's the iptables config? looktj: that does help to reduce PC price though
2006-09-04T13:11:00.000Z	eod_punk		I know of one computer manufactor that doesn't install all the crap
2006-09-04T13:12:00.000Z	eod_punk		i'm sure there are more though
2006-09-04T13:12:00.000Z	anon32	eod_punk	if you order a DELL N-series, you don't get any crap either
