2006-08-08T11:40:00.000Z	Chousuke		Strictly speaking, learning the command line probably isn't required with Linux distros nowadays
2006-08-08T11:40:00.000Z	Chousuke		but since most help is given as command line commands, it does help
2006-08-08T11:41:00.000Z	burhan	Chousuke	yes, especially when something breaks.
2006-08-08T11:41:00.000Z	Chousuke	burhan	the CLI is just the most convenient way of giving help.
2006-08-08T11:40:00.000Z	burhan	Chousuke	you are so wrong.
2006-08-08T11:40:00.000Z	burhan	Chousuke	without the use of cli -- most people are stuck :)
2006-08-08T11:41:00.000Z	Chousuke	burhan	are you sure?
2006-08-08T11:41:00.000Z	burhan	Chousuke	its the most powerful way of using the system.
2006-08-08T11:41:00.000Z	Chousuke	burhan	yes, I know that.
2006-08-08T11:42:00.000Z	burhan	Chousuke	I don't want to argue with you on this, but yes, it is. Anyone tells you otherwise, is kidding themselves.
2006-08-08T11:42:00.000Z	Chousuke	burhan	I can't think of many scenarios where the command line would be strictly necessary.
2006-08-08T11:43:00.000Z	Chousuke	burhan	Infinitely easier that the GUI way, yes, but not necessary.
2006-08-08T11:43:00.000Z	burhan	Chousuke	like I said, I don't want to argue/discuss this with you -- just trust me when I tell you -- cli is necessary.
2006-08-08T11:44:00.000Z	Chousuke	burhan	Heh. I can't accept such an argument .P
2006-08-08T11:45:00.000Z	burhan	Chousuke	once you have administered remote computers, or had to troubleshoot or even USE a system over ssh, you will quickly learn to appreciate the cli. In fact, the GUI is entirely *optional* in linux, as witnessed by any server installation of ubuntu. Most people that know how to use linux will tell you, cli knowledge is essential, without it, you are just hoping nothing breaks, because then you are stuck.
2006-08-08T11:45:00.000Z	Chousuke	burhan	I know all that.
2006-08-08T11:46:00.000Z	burhan	Chousuke	then stop saying stuff like 'its not necessary'.
2006-08-08T11:46:00.000Z	Chousuke	burhan	but for a common user, it's not necesary.
