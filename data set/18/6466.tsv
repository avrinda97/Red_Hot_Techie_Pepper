2008-08-17T18:40:00.000Z	earthian		Hello, I have tried to upgrade FGLRX driver and failed badly: I have removed it and then installed the new one build from the proprietary with --buildpkg ubuntu/hardy, then dpkg -i *.deb with the freshly built debs for the driver. Now I cant login, I get Xsession error about it not finding /etc/ati/ati-fglrx.sh or so... what should I do? How come the new fglrx driver does not put a file that is "needed"? Help! I am stuck in terminal now :
2008-08-17T18:40:00.000Z	earthian		.. xorg.conf seems correct, install did not give any errors..
2008-08-17T18:41:00.000Z	earthian		nano /etc/X11/Xsession
2008-08-17T18:41:00.000Z	earthian		ups :p
2008-08-17T18:44:00.000Z	earthian		apt-get dist-upgrade should do the distro upgrade if you have the sources.list pointing to the 8.04 ones correctly..
2008-08-17T18:44:00.000Z	tj83	earthian	##networking is deader than a door nail :)
2008-08-17T18:44:00.000Z	earthian	tj83	not as dead as #ati i bet :P
2008-08-17T18:45:00.000Z	tj83	earthian	i dunno, a page worth of information and post not a since response. all are sleeping.
