2011-05-08T06:34:00.000Z	grims		my sound still in problem anyone can help?im using maverick
2011-05-08T06:34:00.000Z	escott	grims	what is the problem
2011-05-08T06:35:00.000Z	escott	grims	what kind of card
2011-05-08T06:36:00.000Z	escott	grims	is the standard sound working? is it just the hdmi that is not working?
2011-05-08T06:37:00.000Z	escott	grims	is it listed here: http://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/sound/alsa/HD-Audio-Models.txt
2011-05-08T06:43:00.000Z	escott	grims	if you can find a matching acer model number and a matching chip number (ALC88X) then you can take the bit on the left which I'm guessing for you might be "acer" and put that in your modprobe instructions
2011-05-08T06:45:00.000Z	escott	grims	lspci -v
2011-05-08T06:46:00.000Z	escott	grims	my guess is you want to try options snd-hda-intel model=acer see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HdaIntelSoundHowto for more detailed instructions
2011-05-08T06:57:00.000Z	escott	grims	actually that doesn't say check `cat /proc/asound/pcm`
2011-05-08T07:01:00.000Z	grims	escott	actually all have been turn on
2011-05-08T07:03:00.000Z	escott	grims	there a couple of things that can go wrong with hda audio, basically because while the audio processing routines are standard each laptop connects the inputs and outputs differently to the ports and speakers on the case. so turning on one laptops speakers is another laptops headphone jack
2011-05-08T07:04:00.000Z	escott	grims	if you can match your laptop model and the chip ALC888 to that list you can give a set a snd-hda-intel option model=acer in your modules.d/alsa-base.conf to hint to the kernel how your soundcard is configured
2011-05-08T07:05:00.000Z	escott	grims	then double check that alsamixer isn't muted, and if its still not working there is a low level tool hda_analyzer that will allow you to toggle switches on the soundcard to make it work
2011-05-08T07:35:00.000Z	escott	grims	yes
2011-05-08T07:35:00.000Z	grims	escott	what the tool?
2011-05-08T07:35:00.000Z	escott	grims	hda_analyzer? http://www.alsa-project.org/main/index.php/Help_To_Debug_Intel_HDA
2011-05-08T07:40:00.000Z	escott	grims	the aliases should be fine. you just need the proper options line see https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HdaIntelSoundHowto
2011-05-08T07:41:00.000Z	escott	grims	try options snd-intel-hda model=acer if that doesn't work go back to model=auto or model=basic
