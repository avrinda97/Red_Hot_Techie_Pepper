2005-11-10T07:14:00.000Z	nickrud	eedge	and, umask
2005-11-10T07:16:00.000Z	nickrud	eedge	sorry, got your nick wrong: you cannot change the permissions on a vfat partition; you can set psuedo permissions, look at uid and gid in man mount (and umask)
2005-11-10T07:20:00.000Z	nickrud	eedge	the fundamental point is that vfat does not support permissions per file, only on the whole partition, and can only be set when you mount the partition. That's why you cannot alter them.
2005-11-10T07:22:00.000Z	nickrud	eedge	what was your fstab line again?
2005-11-10T07:23:00.000Z	nickrud	eedge	:-)
2005-11-10T07:26:00.000Z	nickrud	eedge	umount the partition, then mount it
2005-12-29T07:29:00.000Z	nickrud	eedge	you could try setting the http_proxy environment variable, that is:  export http_proxy=<your proxy> that works sometimes
