2012-04-24T06:17:00.000Z	Thisguy_		I DO have a CD with the ISO mastered on it
2012-04-24T06:17:00.000Z	Thisguy_		Now anyway
2012-04-24T06:18:00.000Z	Thisguy_		I've really liked what I've seen in Ubuntu from the apparently-messed-up live-booted session on ubuntu.
2012-04-24T06:19:00.000Z	Thisguy_		I'd love to fix this and get it installed...
2012-04-24T06:19:00.000Z	Thisguy_		What I want to do right now is remove the Boot Loader for Unetbootin.
2012-04-24T06:20:00.000Z	Thisguy_		I'm given no uninstall option =\
2012-04-24T06:20:00.000Z	Thisguy_		I don't have a USB, it's on my HDD inside the laptop...
2012-04-24T06:21:00.000Z	Thisguy_		Useless install program, un-boot-from-able CD, random Boot Loader that loads a live session of the OS.
2012-04-24T06:22:00.000Z	Thisguy_		Ping
2012-04-24T06:22:00.000Z	Thisguy_		derp
2012-04-24T06:23:00.000Z	wylde	Thisguy_	...when you used unetbootin, you selected your hard disk as the target disk?
2012-04-24T06:23:00.000Z	wylde	Thisguy_	uhhh, that's not how it works...
2012-04-24T06:25:00.000Z	wylde	Thisguy_	there's a good chance you killed your partition already by seting it as unetbootin's target disk. You're going to have to find an alternat way to boot to see if you can recover anything.
2012-04-24T06:26:00.000Z	wylde	Thisguy_	well that's good at least.
2012-04-24T06:28:00.000Z	wylde	Thisguy_	well not too bad off if you didn't nuke your windows install. Although, for anyone to help you without causing issues is going to take a LOT of explaining and answering questions on your part.
2012-04-24T06:29:00.000Z	wylde	Thisguy_	just remember not to point unetbootin at your hard disk anymore >.<
2012-04-24T06:31:00.000Z	wylde	Thisguy_	I agree completely with gmachine_24  about making a backup.
2012-04-24T06:33:00.000Z	wylde	Thisguy_	only if you install windows over top of it now. Or have a windows disk to repair the mbr
