2010-08-12T15:09:00.000Z	trond-		is it a bad sign to have 32704 free when calling the free command? (does not look that much to me, really)
2010-08-12T15:09:00.000Z	Slart	trond-	unused memory is wasted memory..
2010-08-12T15:10:00.000Z	Slart	trond-	linux in general uses all the memory it can get it's grubby little hands on.. mostly for caching files and such.. that memory is returned as soon as an application needs it though so it's nothing to worry about
2010-08-12T15:11:00.000Z	trond-	Slart	I c. Thanks for explaining. So having 33mb left is nothing to worry about then.
2010-08-12T15:12:00.000Z	Slart	trond-	there is another number at the same screen.. +/- buffers or something like that.. that's a better indication
2010-08-12T15:13:00.000Z	trond-	Slart	I'll paste that to a pastebin in case someone wants to have a look. This is the second freezup today, and the 5th in two days. Annoying: You bet!!!
2010-08-12T15:13:00.000Z	Slart	trond-	here's the output from my machine http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/476866/  .. I've got 212 MB free.. but on the second line is the number if you ignore the cache/buffers.. that says I've got 6456 MB free..
2010-08-12T15:15:00.000Z	trond-	Slart	this is mine: http://pastebin.org/475035
2010-08-12T15:15:00.000Z	Slart	trond-	you've got 572 MB free if you disregard the memory used for buffers.. that's ok
2010-08-12T15:16:00.000Z	trond-	Slart	ok. So I can leave 'low-memory' as a cause for freezing computer then.
2010-08-12T15:17:00.000Z	Slart	trond-	I think so, yes.. unless it happens when you try to run several virtualbox vm's at once or some other memory hungry thing
2010-08-12T15:18:00.000Z	trond-	Slart	nope. I run OpenOffice, Evolution, netbeans and Chrome or Firefox. Tried Chrome in this session, to rule out if it was a firefox/flash problem.
2010-08-12T15:18:00.000Z	Slart	trond-	you might want to run the memory testing thing as well.. bad memory can do weird things to a machine..
2010-08-12T15:18:00.000Z	trond-	Slart	how do I do that?
2010-08-12T15:19:00.000Z	Slart	trond-	when you boot the machine there's a grub menu (you might need to press ESC during boot to show it).. in that meny there's an option to run a memory test.. just leave that running until it's gone through all your memory
2010-08-12T15:20:00.000Z	trond-	Slart	phlak_user ah, right. I'll do that as soon as the backup is done. I nothing else works I'll reload the computer. Upgraded to 10.04 this time... (never a good idea!)
2010-08-12T15:21:00.000Z	trond-	Slart	I wish that was possible in RL. ;)
