2008-10-26T19:45:00.000Z	LjL	zezu	wasn't one automatically selected for you by ubuntu?
2008-10-26T19:45:00.000Z	zezu	LjL	no
2008-10-26T19:45:00.000Z	LjL		!beta | hardcore
2008-10-26T19:45:00.000Z	zezu		matter of fact i manually installed on and it didn't work
2008-10-26T19:45:00.000Z	LjL		uh, that's not the factoid i wanted to give you, hardcore
2008-10-26T19:45:00.000Z	LjL		!intrepid | hardcore
2008-10-26T19:45:00.000Z	zezu		using generic nvidia driver
2008-10-26T19:45:00.000Z	zezu		with no glx
2008-10-26T19:46:00.000Z	LjL	zezu	does "grep nvidia /etc/X11/xorg.conf" say anything?
2008-10-26T19:46:00.000Z	zezu	LjL	no
2008-10-26T19:47:00.000Z	LjL	zezu	don't install envy if you can avoid it. unless your card is particularly weird, try either nvidia-glx-new or nvidia-glx (your mileage may vary i suppose). see /msg ubottu nvidia
2008-10-26T19:47:00.000Z	zezu	LjL	and the funny thing is i just went through nvidia setup and then when it crashed after ctrl-alt-backspace i set it up in the config menu there too
2008-10-26T19:47:00.000Z	zezu	LjL	i selected nvidia-glx-new
2008-10-26T19:48:00.000Z	zezu	LjL	, I've got a pretty std 9600GT
2008-10-26T19:48:00.000Z	zezu	LjL	audio doesn't work either ... new machine is always a royal pain in linux
