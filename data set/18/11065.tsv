2006-12-08T12:21:00.000Z	knithx		hi
2006-12-08T12:21:00.000Z	knithx		I have problems with ubuntu edgy
2006-12-08T12:21:00.000Z	knithx		When I boot the live CD for installing
2006-12-08T12:21:00.000Z	knithx		After the ubuntu logo with the bar
2006-12-08T12:22:00.000Z	knithx		The screen turns black
2006-12-08T12:22:00.000Z	knithx		and nothing happens
2006-12-08T12:22:00.000Z	knithx		I am using ATI
2006-12-08T12:22:00.000Z	knithx		What can I do?
2006-12-08T12:23:00.000Z	frying_fish	knithx	try pressing ctrl+alt+f1 see if that gives you a command line
2006-12-08T12:23:00.000Z	frying_fish		see if its just a graphics issue then.
2006-12-08T12:23:00.000Z	knithx	frying_fish	no command line
2006-12-08T12:24:00.000Z	frying_fish		try any of the terminal options f1 to f6.
2006-12-08T12:24:00.000Z	knithx	frying_fish	nothing happens, still black
2006-12-08T12:24:00.000Z	frying_fish	knithx	reboot and chose the safe graphics option
2006-12-08T12:25:00.000Z	knithx	frying_fish	but that wouldn't load the ati drivers, so i won't have graphic acceleration
2006-12-08T12:26:00.000Z	knithx		?
2006-12-08T12:26:00.000Z	frying_fish	knithx	no it won't, but you can get that after install, and fix it better then.
2006-12-08T12:27:00.000Z	knithx	frying_fish	Without fglrx? I don't want that, because I want beryl
