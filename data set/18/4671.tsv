2009-03-03T20:48:00.000Z	vu		I have a P4 2.4 with 512 mem.  ubuntu livecd freezes just before it can show the login screen? Why is this? Checked the cd, no problems with it.
2009-03-03T20:49:00.000Z	anonymous1112	vu	im running ubuntu on a 900mhz intel atom with 512mg ram and 4gig hdd, so it should be fast enough
2009-03-03T20:50:00.000Z	anonymous1112	vu	its probably hardware conflict. try another machine
2009-03-03T20:51:00.000Z	vu	anonymous1112	thats the thing I don't understand, it always gets stuck before the login screen. I can see the mouse pointer on the screen and can move it too.  But nothing else happens?
2009-03-03T20:51:00.000Z	vu		older version of knoppix works fine.
2009-03-03T20:51:00.000Z	anonymous1112	vu	how long are you waiting
2009-03-03T20:52:00.000Z	vu		i have waited for as long as 5 mins before restarting the mac.
2009-03-03T20:52:00.000Z	anonymous1112		ok... possibly a hardware conflict if its on an x86 mac
2009-03-03T20:53:00.000Z	vu		I see the orange progress bar, then the orange screen then the small circular pointer and nothing happens.
2009-03-03T20:53:00.000Z	anonymous1112	vu	is it still spinning. maybe try Alt F1
2009-03-03T20:54:00.000Z	vu	anonymous1112	it stops spinning, but it is there, sometimes it changes to a normal pointer and then nothing happens.
2009-03-03T20:55:00.000Z	anonymous1112	vu	try an alt f1 to manually bring up menu
2009-03-03T20:55:00.000Z	vu	anonymous1112	what do I do after the alt + F1?
2009-03-03T20:58:00.000Z	anonymous1112	vu	If you cant bring up the main menu with an Alt F1. at the LiveCD initial boot screen: press Select F6 for more options then add the following option to the beginning of the options list: break=top Press enter to start booting Ubuntu will start booting, but kick you out to a command prompt; at the prompt type these two commands: first "modprobe piix" (dont use the "s), then type exit  the LiveCD should boot normally.
2009-03-03T21:00:00.000Z	anonymous1112	vu	did u get that
2009-03-03T21:02:00.000Z	vu		thx anonymous1112 be back after I try your suggestions.
