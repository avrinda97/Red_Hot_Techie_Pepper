2005-12-28T11:14:00.000Z	DrTiger		hi! I have a laptop connected via pppoe on eth0, and a free wlan interface on eth1. I want to give another laptop with his wlan card access to my internet connection... what do I have to do?
2005-12-28T11:16:00.000Z	DrTiger		I'd like to turn my ubuntu laptop to a wireless router temporarily... what do I need to do?
2005-12-28T11:16:00.000Z	martianpenguin	DrTiger	that might not be easy
2005-12-28T11:17:00.000Z	DrTiger		I guessed that
2005-12-28T11:17:00.000Z	DrTiger		but I don't even know where to start
2005-12-28T11:19:00.000Z	DrTiger	martianpenguin	do you know any keywords that would lead me to some docs?
2005-12-28T11:19:00.000Z	DrTiger		or some ubuntu wiki?
2005-12-28T11:19:00.000Z	martianpenguin	DrTiger	try connecting adhoc first
2005-12-28T11:19:00.000Z	DrTiger		what do you mean by adhoc?
2005-12-28T11:19:00.000Z	martianpenguin		like an internal network between just the two laptops
2005-12-28T11:20:00.000Z	DrTiger		and  how would I do that than?
2005-12-28T11:20:00.000Z	martianpenguin	DrTiger	is the other laptop linux too?
2005-12-28T11:20:00.000Z	DrTiger		thanks
2005-12-28T11:20:00.000Z	DrTiger		the laptop is not here already, but it will probably be windows as my brother doesn't like linux
2005-12-28T11:21:00.000Z	DrTiger		thanks
2005-12-28T11:21:00.000Z	martianpenguin		well, i have to go, talk to y'all later
2005-12-28T11:21:00.000Z	DrTiger		not here yet, I mean
2005-12-28T11:28:00.000Z	DrTiger	martianpenguin	I tried out the wifi Howto but there is no information about turning my wlan card into a router
