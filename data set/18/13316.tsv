2007-08-30T13:09:00.000Z	_tux	goodwinonline	nope never been able to use compiz-fusion my video card can't even handle it
2007-08-30T13:11:00.000Z	_tux	goodwinonline	the VRAM on it is 32MBs its an old outdated ATI All-In-Wonder 128 PRO AGP 4X
2007-08-30T13:12:00.000Z	_tux	goodwinonline	lucky
2007-08-30T13:16:00.000Z	_tux	goodwinonline	usually you create a network in xchat and edit the network then add channel or something like that to it then log in to that network and type: /join #compiz-fusion if that's the name of it
2007-08-30T13:19:00.000Z	_tux	goodwinonline	you used to using xchat on ubuntu or irc in general
2007-08-30T13:20:00.000Z	_tux	goodwinonline	using xchat right now or some type of irc on Windows?
2007-08-30T13:21:00.000Z	_tux	goodwinonline	never used IRC on GAIM my advice would be to install xchat
2007-08-30T13:32:00.000Z	_tux	goodwinonline	By default Ubuntu is more secure seeing as it doesn't allow the root account to be used other than that its got a built in firewall and doesn't have ports open by default
2007-08-30T13:34:00.000Z	_tux	goodwinonline	yes if you got a pretty strong password
2007-08-30T13:41:00.000Z	_tux	goodwinonline	though if you have services enabled ports will be left open you can determine open ports using a port scanner called nmap
2007-08-30T13:41:00.000Z	_tux	goodwinonline	netfilter is enabled by default so the firewall is on regradless unless you disabled it which I wouldn't know how to do haha
2007-08-30T13:44:00.000Z	_tux	goodwinonline	you should be good if its only going to be use as a desktop
2007-08-30T13:46:00.000Z	_tux	goodwinonline	never used it before but heard of it
2007-08-30T13:50:00.000Z	_tux	goodwinonline	preaction just answered your question
2007-08-30T13:51:00.000Z	_tux	goodwinonline	it all depends some people might just want an OS for games, programming, modifying a kernel like the Linux kernel, or something completely different
