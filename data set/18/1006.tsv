2011-07-10T13:15:00.000Z	Ozik	pozic	and google knows maybe how to solve my WoL problem? :)
2011-07-10T13:15:00.000Z	pozic	Ozik	I read it, but I have no idea on that one.
2011-07-10T13:16:00.000Z	Ozik	pozic	any idea who can knows? maybe different q: why ubuntu disappeared from dhcp after some time after halt and other devices not
2011-07-10T13:17:00.000Z	pozic	Ozik	do you understand what dhcp does?
2011-07-10T13:18:00.000Z	Ozik	pozic	ofcourse, but WRT54G2 can't do ip<->MAC reservations, so I go around and set 9999 minutes ip reservation, I am able to look into DHCP clients table
2011-07-10T13:19:00.000Z	pozic	Ozik	so, use static ip addresses.
2011-07-10T13:19:00.000Z	pozic	Ozik	that's what I do.
2011-07-10T13:20:00.000Z	Ozik	pozic	linksys are weird. DHCP starts from 192.168.0.100, router is on 0.1, even if I set up static ie. 0.5 dhcp somehow override it
2011-07-10T13:21:00.000Z	pozic	Ozik	you can disable dhcp.
2011-07-10T13:21:00.000Z	pozic	Ozik	unless the router is really the SUX.
2011-07-10T13:23:00.000Z	Ozik	pozic	WRT54G2 really sux, it has firmware 1.5 which can't be replaced by wrt-dd
2011-07-10T13:23:00.000Z	pozic	Ozik	if you cannot disable dhcp completely, then just throw the router away.
2011-07-10T13:24:00.000Z	Ozik	pozic	I can do it, but I'm not sjure what will happen then ^^
2011-07-10T13:24:00.000Z	pozic	Ozik	you have to configure all your clients to use a static ip anyway.
2011-07-10T13:24:00.000Z	Ozik		*shure
2011-07-10T13:25:00.000Z	Ozik		tomato?
2011-07-10T13:26:00.000Z	Ozik		wrt-dd can be applied but not into WRT54G2, not enough memory LOL
2011-07-10T13:29:00.000Z	Ozik	pozic	tell me what exaclty does halt?
