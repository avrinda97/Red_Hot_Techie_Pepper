2008-03-10T04:52:00.000Z	ut2004player		anyone know recommended specs to run ubuntu screensavers?
2008-03-10T04:53:00.000Z	cwillu	ut2004player	many don't really have any required specs;  anything opengl will work better if you have working acceleration
2008-03-10T04:55:00.000Z	ut2004player	cwillu	SpirographX, a screensaver, for example runs EXTREMLEY slow? is it my laptop? (single core 1.86 ghz, 512 ram, 40 gig HD, intel integrated graphics 128mb)
2008-03-10T04:56:00.000Z	cwillu	ut2004player	run this in a terminal: glxinfo | grep -i direct
2008-03-10T04:58:00.000Z	ut2004player	cwillu	it says Direct Rendering: No OpenGL rendering string: Mesa GLX Indirect
2008-03-10T04:59:00.000Z	cwillu	ut2004player	that's your problem.  what video card do you have?
2008-03-10T05:02:00.000Z	ut2004player	cwillu	Intel Graphics Media Accelerator 915
2008-03-10T05:02:00.000Z	cwillu	ut2004player	gutsy?
2008-03-10T05:04:00.000Z	ut2004player	cwillu	whats gutsy?
2008-03-10T05:04:00.000Z	cwillu	ut2004player	which version of ubuntu do you have?
2008-03-10T05:05:00.000Z	ut2004player	cwillu	yes gutsy
2008-03-10T05:05:00.000Z	cwillu	ut2004player	upgrade or fresh install?
2008-03-10T05:05:00.000Z	ut2004player	cwillu	live CD
2008-03-10T05:07:00.000Z	cwillu	ut2004player	probably just a problem with the autodetection then;  this sort of thing is nearly impossible to 'fix' from the cd though, as it generally requires reboots to figure out what exactly is going on
2008-03-10T05:09:00.000Z	ut2004player	cwillu	so if i reboot will it fix? also is my hardware ok should it be able to run these geometric heavy screensavers?
2008-03-10T05:09:00.000Z	cwillu	ut2004player	as long as your on a live cd, it's going to be impossible to actually show you it working, for all intents and purposes
2008-03-10T05:10:00.000Z	cwillu	ut2004player	but I would be very very surprised if it didn't work in a full install (after at most a few minutes of futsing around)
2008-03-10T05:11:00.000Z	ut2004player	cwillu	thanks alot! :)
