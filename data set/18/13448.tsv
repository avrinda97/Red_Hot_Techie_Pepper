2006-01-08T13:58:00.000Z	LabThug		Does anyone in here use CPAN?
2006-01-08T13:58:00.000Z	polpak	LabThug	I have used it yes
2006-01-08T13:59:00.000Z	LabThug	polpak	I was trying to install DBI, and make threw up a bunch of C++ errors.  Have you seen this?
2006-01-08T13:59:00.000Z	polpak	LabThug	you probably need the c++ compiler
2006-01-08T13:59:00.000Z	polpak	LabThug	oh. then it depends on what the errors are
2006-01-08T13:59:00.000Z	polpak	LabThug	 what module are you installing
2006-01-08T14:00:00.000Z	polpak	LabThug	I think it's already in the ubuntu repos
2006-01-08T14:02:00.000Z	polpak	LabThug	I'm checking. One sec
2006-01-08T14:05:00.000Z	polpak	LabThug	it's libdbi-perl I believe
2006-01-08T14:05:00.000Z	LabThug	polpak	thanks
2006-01-08T14:05:00.000Z	polpak	LabThug	and actually
2006-01-08T14:06:00.000Z	polpak	LabThug	as a general rule any module in CPAN
2006-01-08T14:06:00.000Z	polpak	LabThug	which is like Text::CSV would be libtext-csv-perl
2006-01-08T14:07:00.000Z	LabThug	polpak	thanks for that info.  I'm just starting out with perl, so I'm happy to hear that
2006-01-08T14:07:00.000Z	polpak	LabThug	sorry to hear it =p
2006-01-08T14:07:00.000Z	polpak	LabThug	Is this for work, or just for fun?
2006-01-08T14:08:00.000Z	LabThug	polpak	work.  I'm taking over for a guy that only coded in perl
2006-01-08T14:08:00.000Z	polpak	LabThug	ah. Cause otherwise I'd suggest taking a peek at python
