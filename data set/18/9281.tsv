2007-04-24T06:01:00.000Z	haru	HOT	??
2007-04-24T06:01:00.000Z	HOT	haru	in my experience either you need to point to the correct dns or you need to enable netbios / smb support
2007-04-24T06:01:00.000Z	haru	HOT	i set the dns to the one my windows pc uses
2007-04-24T06:02:00.000Z	haru	HOT	i also added wins to /etc/nsswitch.conf and installed winbind
2007-04-24T06:02:00.000Z	HOT	haru	are all your windows machines on static IP's ?
2007-04-24T06:02:00.000Z	haru	HOT	no ... some are static.. rest are via DHCP
2007-04-24T06:02:00.000Z	haru	HOT	i also configured samba to act as a wins client..
2007-04-24T06:03:00.000Z	HOT	haru	well this isnt a full solution but for static ips you can make an entry in /etc/hosts for example "192.168.0.1 server server.example"
2007-04-24T06:03:00.000Z	haru	HOT	but mosts ips are obtained via dhcp.. any solution for thsoe?
2007-04-24T06:04:00.000Z	HOT	haru	is your router building a DNS table for all the machines on the network?
2007-04-24T06:05:00.000Z	haru	HOT	i am not sure how the router works.. seeing as i have to access to the network administration :(
2007-04-24T06:05:00.000Z	haru	HOT	tho i think it does that
2007-04-24T06:06:00.000Z	HOT	haru	do "sudo ifconfig" and make sure you are on the correct dns
2007-04-24T06:06:00.000Z	haru	HOT	eth0 inet addr:10.100.90.127  Bcast:10.100.255.255  Mask:255.255.0.0
2007-05-10T16:37:00.000Z	HOT	haru	try lowering the colour from 24bit to 16bit, it makes a massive difference to speed
2007-05-10T16:38:00.000Z	haru	HOT	erUSUL even if its on a 100Mbps lan?
2007-05-10T16:39:00.000Z	haru	HOT	i lowered it to 64K.. but the output screen looks bad
