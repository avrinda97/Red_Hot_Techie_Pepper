2009-01-12T00:10:00.000Z	xinel		I'm having a little problem with firewall rules, I've explained it best on the forums here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=6534264#post6534264
2009-01-12T00:11:00.000Z	Titan8990	xinel	are you aware that the default rules allow all those things to work?
2009-01-12T00:11:00.000Z	xinel	Titan8990	so I should remove all my firewall settings and retry?
2009-01-12T00:12:00.000Z	xinel	Titan8990	its from a server to the home lan
2009-01-12T00:12:00.000Z	Titan8990	xinel	You are configuring this on a server?
2009-01-12T00:13:00.000Z	xinel	Titan8990	yes, I have a server I made between my home network and the internet
2009-01-12T00:13:00.000Z	Titan8990	xinel	I see you are using a machine as a proxy
2009-01-12T00:13:00.000Z	Titan8990	xinel	kind of.....
2009-01-12T00:13:00.000Z	xinel	Titan8990	yes kind of
2009-01-12T00:14:00.000Z	xinel	Titan8990	the server makes a connection using openvpn to an external server, the idea is that the home network then uses that connection
2009-01-12T00:15:00.000Z	Titan8990	xinel	you could try setting your default forward rule to accept
2009-01-12T00:15:00.000Z	xinel	Titan8990	will give that a try now bbl
2009-01-12T00:16:00.000Z	xinel	Titan8990	cheers
2009-01-12T00:36:00.000Z	xinel	Titan8990	didn't need to change the default action, all i needed to do in the end was masquerade tun0
2009-01-12T00:37:00.000Z	Titan8990	xinel	good to hear it wasn't overly difficult
2009-01-12T00:37:00.000Z	xinel	Titan8990	haha not overly difficult, but a pain :P
2009-01-12T00:37:00.000Z	Titan8990	xinel	although I thought masquerading was required for any type of network briding at all
2009-01-12T00:37:00.000Z	xinel	Titan8990	didn't know that, know I will remember it ;)
