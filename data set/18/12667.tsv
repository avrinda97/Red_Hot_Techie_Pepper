2006-03-21T11:36:00.000Z	raptorx		i cant remember where it is at all
2006-03-21T11:37:00.000Z	powder	raptorx	i have a question for you, do you have 1280x960 resolution available to you?
2006-03-21T11:37:00.000Z	raptorx	powder	I dont think so
2006-03-21T11:37:00.000Z	powder	raptorx	damn, that's my preferred resolution and i can't get it to work with ati drivers / breezy
2006-03-21T11:37:00.000Z	raptorx	powder	Xgl starts up on display 93 it loads up gnome (kind of) and it loads the background
2006-03-21T11:38:00.000Z	raptorx	powder	maybe if i just change the drivers to display 93
2006-03-21T11:38:00.000Z	raptorx		by spamming a lot
2006-03-21T11:38:00.000Z	raptorx		i'll give it a shot
2006-03-21T11:38:00.000Z	powder	raptorx	not sure, i refuse to use ati drivers until they support 1280x960 >:O
