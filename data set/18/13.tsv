2004-09-12T05:59:00.000Z	elmo		kamion: how do I get the desktop stuff want-to-be-installed, without using base-config?
2004-09-12T06:01:00.000Z	elmo		hmm, yeah, that doesn't seem to set them to 'install' when you have an uninstallable.. meh
2004-09-12T06:02:00.000Z	elmo		that would require me to be able to run aptitude without running screaming from the room ;-)
2004-09-12T06:02:00.000Z	elmo		but ok
2004-09-12T06:02:00.000Z	elmo		okay, getting very bored with the lack of tty tickets

2004-09-12T06:03:00.000Z	elmo		"Unrecognized"? 
2004-09-12T06:03:00.000Z	jdub	elmo	it's a breakaway task which we have no diplomatic relations with at this stage
2004-09-14T05:47:00.000Z	jdub	elmo	yeah
2004-09-19T08:15:00.000Z	elmo	jdub	process mails?
2004-09-19T08:17:00.000Z	jdub	elmo	about packages from ftp to the archive?
2004-09-19T08:17:00.000Z	elmo	jdub	no, don't think so
