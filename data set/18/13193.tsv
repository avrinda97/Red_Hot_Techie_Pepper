2005-12-26T16:30:00.000Z	JackPalmiery		which one should I download
2005-12-26T16:31:00.000Z	JackPalmiery		first time user, though I know my way around somewhat on the command line.. why Gnome?
2005-12-26T16:31:00.000Z	JackPalmiery		used other linux distributions, but not ubuntu or kubuntu
2005-12-26T16:32:00.000Z	JackPalmiery		what is the difference between ubuntu and kubuntu? or gnome/KDE
2005-12-26T16:33:00.000Z	JackPalmiery		any kubuntu users around?
2005-12-26T16:34:00.000Z	JackPalmiery		why prefer kubuntu?
2005-12-26T16:34:00.000Z	JackPalmiery		ok, let me rephrase - why prefer KDE?
2005-12-26T16:34:00.000Z	JackPalmiery		what 3 main things
2005-12-26T16:34:00.000Z	JackPalmiery		for example.. make KDE prefereable
2005-12-26T16:35:00.000Z	JackPalmiery		which is simpler to use
2005-12-26T16:35:00.000Z	phibxr	JackPalmiery	configurability, k-apps integrated, a qt-based environment if you like that.
2005-12-26T16:36:00.000Z	phibxr	JackPalmiery	i'm a big fan of gnome and gtk, by the way. :P
2005-12-26T16:36:00.000Z	phibxr	JackPalmiery	prepare to enter the world of flame wars. ^_^
2005-12-26T16:38:00.000Z	phibxr	JackPalmiery	listen to trappist. he's on the right track here. ;)
2005-12-26T16:39:00.000Z	phibxr	JackPalmiery	in the last comment, that is.
2005-12-26T16:44:00.000Z	phibxr	JackPalmiery	if you like windows, you'll probably like kde. it's a bit more polished, though, so you don't have to like windows just because you like kde. gnome has its own, a bit apple-ish, way of doing things, and the developers are set on making a clean, easy to use environment.
2005-12-26T16:45:00.000Z	phibxr	JackPalmiery	the only way is to try them both out, as everyone is saying.
2005-12-26T16:45:00.000Z	phibxr	JackPalmiery	and preferably xfce too. :)
