2006-05-29T12:27:00.000Z	Hso		che.. just guessed the pw :D so easy! XD
2006-05-29T12:27:00.000Z	Hso		looking at the website my sister just created :P
2006-05-29T12:28:00.000Z	Hso		it's one of those crappy websites that you can password, to stop unwanted people from looking at it :O
2006-05-29T12:29:00.000Z	Hso		My bro dug out a very old machine.. an Amstrad em@iler SMS computer thingy! any idea what website/cummunity I would need to go to, to see if Linux can be installed on it? :O
2006-05-29T12:29:00.000Z	Hso		heh
2006-05-29T12:29:00.000Z	Flannel	Hso	check google ;)
2006-05-29T12:30:00.000Z	Hso	Flannel	I did check _ I was on a website earlier, but firefox just decided to close itself when my sister was using the pc... I don't remember what website I was looking at _
2006-05-29T12:32:00.000Z	Flannel	Hso	check your history.
2006-05-29T12:32:00.000Z	Hso	Flannel	- too many links x_X it'll take HOURS!" >_<
2006-05-29T12:32:00.000Z	Flannel	Hso	history, then you can "sort by last visited"
2006-05-29T12:32:00.000Z	Hso	Flannel	 - that will take HOURS! :P
2006-05-29T12:33:00.000Z	Flannel	Hso	no, since, presumably you're reading something close to the top, as it was the last you were reading.
2006-05-29T12:33:00.000Z	Flannel	Hso	google.  But, the answer is 'yes', the question is 'how easily can I/what do I ave to do'/etc
2006-05-29T12:34:00.000Z	Hso	Flannel	 - any further ideas for that? :P
2006-05-29T12:34:00.000Z	Flannel	Hso	yeah, google it.
2006-05-29T12:34:00.000Z	Hso	Flannel	- yes, but google what phrase? _
2006-05-29T12:35:00.000Z	Flannel	Hso	whatever the model number is, etc.  "technical specs" with it would be good for general information, "linux" and the name will get you exactly what you need, maybe 'install linux' plus it, etc.
2006-05-29T12:36:00.000Z	Flannel	Hso	take it to #ubuntu-offtopic  and no it's not.  You just are going to have to do some research.
