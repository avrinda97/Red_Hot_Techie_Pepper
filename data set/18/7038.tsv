2008-04-07T02:18:00.000Z	iGama		skype is not in the official repositories
2008-04-07T02:18:00.000Z	iGama		so there is no point for that in this case
2008-04-07T02:19:00.000Z	iGama		2ยบ New users should learn to use the graphical interface first, to understand the concepts, and then evolve to terminal mode :p
2008-04-07T02:19:00.000Z	iGama		thats my ideias :)
2008-04-07T02:19:00.000Z	iGama		Strang3love,
2008-04-07T02:19:00.000Z	iGama		sudo aptitude install -f
2008-04-07T02:20:00.000Z	iGama		it will give you a solution to resolve that
2008-04-07T02:20:00.000Z	iGama		phoenix24, reinstall the xserver-xorg-ati package
2008-04-07T02:21:00.000Z	iGama		i think thats the right name, but check in synaptic
2008-04-07T02:21:00.000Z	phoenix5002	iGama	I tried that, marked it for reinstallation and clicked apply
2008-04-07T02:22:00.000Z	phoenix5002	iGama	I switched to Hardy Heron... but I'm sure thats not causing the problem because I had open source drivers working in Hardy, and then I changed to fglrx and now I'm having a problem getting back to the open source drivers.
2008-04-07T02:22:00.000Z	iGama	phoenix5002	sudo apt-get install libgl1-mesa-glx libgl1-mesa-dri
2008-04-07T02:23:00.000Z	phoenix5002	iGama	I tried that too
2008-04-07T02:23:00.000Z	phoenix5002	iGama	is there a way I can just directly reinstall the libGL.so file or package?
2008-04-07T02:26:00.000Z	iGama	phoenix5002	libgl1-mesa
2008-04-07T02:29:00.000Z	phoenix5002	iGama	I reinstalled the libgl1-mesa packages and it didn't work.  Still says vendor is SGI.
2008-04-07T02:30:00.000Z	phoenix5002	iGama	my card isn't supported by Envy
