2005-12-06T13:55:00.000Z	jacobkm		Hey, folks -- I'm trying to get my box to bind to a number of IP addresses when it boots using virtual interfaces (i.e. eth0:1, eth0:2, etc.) and I can't figure out how to make the interfaces come up on boot.  My /etc/network/interfaces is at http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl/5271; anyone have any pointers?
2005-12-06T13:56:00.000Z	dabaR_	jacobkm	and they work, but do not come up on boot?
2005-12-06T13:57:00.000Z	jacobkm	dabaR_	yes
2005-12-06T13:57:00.000Z	dabaR_	jacobkm	neither of the two do, right?
2005-12-06T13:57:00.000Z	jacobkm	dabaR_	eth0 does; eth0:1 does not.
2005-12-06T13:57:00.000Z	dabaR_	jacobkm	how do you start eth0:1?
2005-12-06T13:58:00.000Z	jacobkm	dabaR_	"ifup eth0:1" does the trick, just not at boot.
2005-12-06T13:58:00.000Z	dabaR_	jacobkm	that is all your interfaces file has in it?
2005-12-06T13:58:00.000Z	jacobkm	dabaR_	yup, that's it.
2005-12-06T13:59:00.000Z	dabaR_	jacobkm	well. try adding as the last line, auto eth0:1, then come back if that does not do it.
2005-12-06T13:59:00.000Z	dabaR_	jacobkm	just one sec, tho.
2005-12-06T13:59:00.000Z	jacobkm	dabaR_	I'll try that...
2005-12-06T13:59:00.000Z	dabaR_	jacobkm	do you remember the comments that were in the file?
2005-12-06T14:00:00.000Z	jacobkm	dabaR_	if they're the same as the ones on my other ubuntu box then yes
2005-12-06T14:01:00.000Z	dabaR_	jacobkm	ya, shoudl be. What I am talking about is where it says the hotplug is the automatically started interfaces. if this does not work, you can try that.
2005-12-06T14:01:00.000Z	jacobkm	dabaR_	rebooting now; I'll see if that works -- thanks
2005-12-06T14:04:00.000Z	jacobkm	dabaR_	that was it! much thanks
2005-12-06T14:05:00.000Z	dabaR_	jacobkm	sweet:)
