2010-11-20T08:23:00.000Z	illdecree		what's wrong with openvpn? i've got little experience with it, but i was never unhappy with it...?
2010-11-20T08:23:00.000Z	illdecree		humanmeat: yes?
2010-11-20T08:23:00.000Z	illdecree		i wasn't aware of that LOL. been years since i used it or even looked at it
2010-11-20T08:24:00.000Z	illdecree		so, i wouldn't. good to know, b/c i was actually considering it for a project awhile back...
2010-11-20T08:24:00.000Z	illdecree		hey, humanMeat, are you good with bluetooth in meerkat?
2010-11-20T08:25:00.000Z	illdecree		i haven't either, and i'm stuck...
2010-11-20T08:25:00.000Z	illdecree		anyone else in here good with bluetooth in 10.10?
2010-11-20T08:25:00.000Z	message144	illdecree	i didnt  even know bluetooth works with linux
2010-11-20T08:26:00.000Z	message144	illdecree	could have fooled me
2010-11-20T08:26:00.000Z	illdecree	message144	i've managed to get my s305's paired, but i can't pipe audio into the headphones
2010-11-20T08:26:00.000Z	message144	illdecree	oh yeah, ive been down linux audio hell a few times... i dont envy you
2010-11-20T08:27:00.000Z	illdecree	message144	  :-)    i'm not quite there yet, maybe purgatory
2010-11-20T08:28:00.000Z	message144	illdecree	i did notice ubuntu audio got way better with 10.04 over the previous releases though.. im hoping its not something i need to worry about anymore
2010-11-20T08:29:00.000Z	illdecree	message144	i sure hope so. i'd love to figure out how to get some headphones working. would make going to work a lot more enjoyable
2010-11-20T08:29:00.000Z	message144	illdecree	if it helps, ive had much better luck with logitech usb headphones, than with analog 1/8" headphones with ubuntu
2010-11-20T08:30:00.000Z	illdecree	message144	that might be something to look into... i've been using analog for awhile now, and i'd like to cut the cord, and go wireless
2010-11-20T08:31:00.000Z	message144	illdecree	yeah, ive never had luck with the analog headphones on my ubuntu machines.. the logitech usb support is really good though
2010-11-20T08:31:00.000Z	message144	illdecree	of course it depends on the sound card
