2010-02-04T12:30:00.000Z	[BT]Brendan		I just did an rsync command and someone completely deleted my website. any idea how to recover the files?
2010-02-04T12:30:00.000Z	[BT]Brendan		somehow*
2010-02-04T12:30:00.000Z	chelz	[BT]Brendan	do you have physical access to the machine?
2010-02-04T12:32:00.000Z	chelz	[BT]Brendan	do you have a copy of the site somewhere or did you delete your only copy?
2010-02-04T12:33:00.000Z	chelz	[BT]Brendan	so the copy was local?
2010-02-04T12:33:00.000Z	chelz	[BT]Brendan	if you can, turn off the machine forcefully with the drive in it. as in hold down power
2010-02-04T12:34:00.000Z	chelz	[BT]Brendan	were you using ext3?
2010-02-04T12:34:00.000Z	chelz	[BT]Brendan	the longer a machine is on gives it more time to write to a disk and overwrite the data you want to recover
2010-02-04T13:25:00.000Z	chelz	[BT]Brendan	there are tools that do that, just not the default ones. *nixes expect people to have backups

2010-02-06T14:34:00.000Z	[BT]Brendan	chelz	 sorry to keep bugging the instructions were basically the same as the other ones and don't seem to work at all for me.
2010-02-06T14:36:00.000Z	chelz	[BT]Brendan	np. i haven't had that issue so my best guess would be to poke around the ubuntu sound troubleshooting article
2010-02-06T15:17:00.000Z	chelz	[BT]Brendan	righ click -> open volume control
2010-02-06T15:19:00.000Z	chelz	[BT]Brendan	restoring sound stuff can be done through the sound troubleshooting document
