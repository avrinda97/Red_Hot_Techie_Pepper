2010-10-07T08:16:00.000Z	Cancambo		Alright, so my problem is that I can't access the internet even though NDISwrapper recognizes my wireless card and wireless netowkrs.  I can connect to my network, but not the internet.  Currently, I am on my WIndows partition and I can access the internet just fine here (same network).  Here's the pastebin of a lot of commands I ran (I'm not sure which oens are relevant, I just ran everyone in the thread I found) http://pastebin.co
2010-10-07T08:17:00.000Z	kaosZERO	Cancambo	your pastbin link was cut short
2010-10-07T08:18:00.000Z	kaosZERO	Cancambo	it looks like wlan0 does not have an ipv4 address
2010-10-07T08:20:00.000Z	kaosZERO	Cancambo	your ISP gives you a static IP for your wireless network?
2010-10-07T08:24:00.000Z	kaosZERO	Cancambo	are you using network manager?
2010-10-07T08:28:00.000Z	kaosZERO	Cancambo	from your pastbin post when you ran dhclient wlan0, it did not recive any dhcpoffers. that means it can not contact a dhcp server. do you know what private range your wifi network is using?
2010-10-07T08:30:00.000Z	kaosZERO	Cancambo	can you find the ip address of that windows computer? you will also need dns and gateway settings
2010-10-07T08:31:00.000Z	Cancambo	kaosZERO	will ipconfig in cmd get the needed info?
2010-10-07T08:32:00.000Z	kaosZERO	Cancambo	you can but it's convulated
2010-10-07T08:36:00.000Z	kaosZERO	Cancambo	now take those ip settings and put them into your ubuntu install. Right click on the network manager icon and choose edit connections.
2010-10-07T08:38:00.000Z	kaosZERO	Cancambo	i don't think so. make sure you put those setting in exactly like your windows pc
2010-10-07T08:39:00.000Z	kaosZERO	Cancambo	good idea and good luck.
2010-10-07T09:03:00.000Z	kaosZERO	Cancambo	i'm beginning to suspect you may not be connected to the access point.
2010-10-07T09:06:00.000Z	kaosZERO	Cancambo	by using a static ip you have eliminated dhcp as the problem. there must be an issue joining the access point
2010-10-07T09:08:00.000Z	kaosZERO	Cancambo	do you have a way to view some kind of status page on your wifi router? maybe a log?
2010-10-07T09:09:00.000Z	kaosZERO	Cancambo	also on ubuntu you can run dmesg | grep wlan0. this could help locate the problem too
2010-10-07T09:11:00.000Z	kaosZERO	Cancambo	i hate to leave you hanging but i have to go. i hope you get your problem solved
2010-10-07T09:12:00.000Z	kaosZERO	Cancambo	it looks like it's making a connection but those may be from windows? really i need to go, i have 3 little ones to put to bed. :)
