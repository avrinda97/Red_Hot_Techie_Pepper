2009-05-31T08:56:00.000Z	sensae		I had netbeans installed on 8.10, and apparently the upgrade to 9.04 removed the package but left orphaned files (like the binary) still on my system. What's the easiest way to scrub my system of these unwanted, non-working files?

2009-05-31T08:58:00.000Z	gartral	sensae	the *old* way would be to see if apt-get autoremove would take care of them
2009-05-31T08:59:00.000Z	sensae		gartal: Neither took care of it :/
2009-05-31T08:59:00.000Z	sensae		*gartral
2009-05-31T08:59:00.000Z	gartral	sensae	wheres your post?
2009-05-31T09:00:00.000Z	sensae	gartral	Neither took care of it*
2009-05-31T09:00:00.000Z	gartral	sensae	manually remove?
2009-05-31T09:01:00.000Z	sensae	gartral	I'm not sure where all the files are. It's still in my Applications menu, and apparently that points to /user/local/netbeans-6.5/bin/netbeans but I'm not sure where else files might live and how to remove it from my apps menu
2009-05-31T09:02:00.000Z	gartral	sensae	try sudo appt-get autoremove, if you didnt make the assumption earlier
2009-05-31T09:02:00.000Z	gartral	sensae	try sudo apt-get autoremove
2009-05-31T09:03:00.000Z	sensae	gartral	Yeah, that's what I meant when I said I tried both, it didn't work either. Right now I'm trying a 'find / -name netbeans 2> /dev/null' but I dunno how to remove it from my menu
2009-05-31T09:04:00.000Z	gartral	sensae	stupid question on my part, but, have you tryed sudo apt-get purge netbeans?
2009-05-31T09:04:00.000Z	sensae	gartral	Package netbeans is not installed. Looks to have done nothing.
2009-05-31T09:05:00.000Z	gartral	sensae	hit up, and try auto-completiing the packaage name..
2009-05-31T09:05:00.000Z	sensae	gartral	apt-cache search shows the only netbeans package is "netbeans"
2009-05-31T09:06:00.000Z	gartral	sensae	search forums, im at a los, i never use netbeans
2009-05-31T09:06:00.000Z	sensae	gartral	Lol I'm wishing I had never tried it now - I moved on to eclipse. Thanks for trying.
