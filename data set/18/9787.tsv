2007-03-10T11:13:00.000Z	jrib	zpertee	did you ever set a root password?  uBUNTU DOESN'T HAVE ONE BY DEFAULT
2007-03-10T11:14:00.000Z	zpertee	jrib	I may not have. can't remember for sure.  how can I set one up?
2007-03-10T11:14:00.000Z	jrib	zpertee	you don't need one.  Do you know about sudo?
2007-03-10T11:15:00.000Z	zpertee	jrib	won't I need a password when I use sudo though?
2007-03-10T11:15:00.000Z	jrib	zpertee	yep, it's your user's password
2007-03-10T11:15:00.000Z	zpertee	jrib	ok
2007-03-10T11:21:00.000Z	zpertee	jrib	do you know how to reload network settings without rebooting
2007-03-10T11:22:00.000Z	jrib	zpertee	no, not really...  sudo invoke-rc.d networking restart   maybe

2007-03-10T11:32:00.000Z	zpertee	jrib	ok
2007-03-10T11:34:00.000Z	zpertee	jrib	how do I disable it from the software repository preferences
2007-03-10T11:36:00.000Z	jrib	zpertee	I'm not sure... it should just be an obvious checkbox in one of the tabs
2007-03-10T11:36:00.000Z	zpertee	jrib	if I'm not using the gui I will have to do it a different way?
2007-03-10T11:36:00.000Z	jrib	zpertee	you can comment the cdrom line in /etc/apt/sources.list
2007-03-10T11:37:00.000Z	zpertee	jrib	ok that's what I'll do
