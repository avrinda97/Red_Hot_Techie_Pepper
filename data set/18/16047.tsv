2004-11-24T12:08:00.000Z	skelll		after the agp-intel everything seems buggy

2004-11-24T12:10:00.000Z	veran		since I have only been using ubuntu for 30 minutes, I don't know if you can specify a nofbcon on boot

2004-11-24T12:11:00.000Z	veran		is that on boot or after gdm starts to load?
2004-11-24T12:12:00.000Z	skelll	veran	i don't go to gdm just to module loading so i don't see gdm :)
