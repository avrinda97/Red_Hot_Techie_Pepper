2007-09-17T11:53:00.000Z	Whack		however, they fire keypress events, Hone, End, and Backspace
2007-09-17T11:54:00.000Z	Whack		i have verified with xev, no button events at all
2007-09-17T11:54:00.000Z	Whack		i want to use them to control compiz, to initiate the shift switcher, expo, and scale plugins
2007-09-17T11:54:00.000Z	Whack		macs have 3 buttons now
2007-09-17T11:55:00.000Z	Whack		even though the mac mouse looks like one button, it has right and left
2007-09-17T11:55:00.000Z	Whack		and the scroll ball is clickable
2007-09-17T11:55:00.000Z	Whack		and it has a thumb button :P
2007-09-17T11:55:00.000Z	Whack		i still hate them though, they just dont feel "right", like they track differently
2007-09-17T11:55:00.000Z	Whack		feels like a gunked up ball mouse
2007-09-17T11:56:00.000Z	Whack		so does anyone have any ideas why the extra buttons on my mouse would function as Home, End and Bksp keys?
2007-09-17T11:57:00.000Z	bruenig	Whack	you can map the buttons to certain keys so it's not inconceivable
2007-09-17T12:12:00.000Z	bruenig	Whack	the root account is disabled by default so they would have to unlock that also
2007-09-17T12:24:00.000Z	Whack	bruenig	lol i do the same
2007-09-17T12:33:00.000Z	bruenig	Whack	you don't actually do anything, that's the point, it builds it for you
2007-09-17T12:33:00.000Z	bruenig	Whack	you don't use it in gentoo either
2007-09-17T12:33:00.000Z	bruenig	Whack	here is the difference, apt-get install xchat and emerge xchat
2007-09-17T12:42:00.000Z	bruenig	Whack	grep is a program
2007-09-17T12:44:00.000Z	bruenig	Whack	linux does not depend on those nor do those things depend on linux, see solaris
