2006-06-04T07:55:00.000Z	Sub	centipeed	it's your xorg.conf is set up wrong
2006-06-04T07:56:00.000Z	centipeed	Sub	I only just got Ubuntu, so could you run me through it?
2006-06-04T07:59:00.000Z	Sub	centipeed	well basically, google your monitor make, find the horiz/vert rates ( there in Hz), then use a Live CD, like the ubuntu install CD, then mount your harddrive partiton (probably "mount /dev/hda1/ /media/hda1/" ) then goto /media/hda1/etc/X11/xorg.conf and look for the bit about your monitor and itz horizontal and vert. refresh rates, type in the value and your done. OR switch it on normally, and try pushing CTRL ALT F
2006-06-04T08:00:00.000Z	centipeed	Sub	I'm on Ubuntu right now. Can't I make the changes from the HDD install instead of using a Live CD?
2006-06-04T08:00:00.000Z	Sub	centipeed	wait, so your on the system that gives the error. what is the problem then?
2006-06-04T08:01:00.000Z	Sub	centipeed	well if it was a one off thing, itz likely itz the monitor not ubuntu that is the problem,.
2006-06-04T08:02:00.000Z	Sub	centipeed	the screen setup is located in /etc/X11/xorg.conf, look in that file
2006-06-04T08:05:00.000Z	Sub	centipeed	look for -> Section "Monitor"
2006-06-04T08:07:00.000Z	Sub	centipeed	you should have something like http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/15077
2006-06-04T08:07:00.000Z	centipeed	Sub	My file is missing HorizSync and VertRefresh. Is it OK to just put them in there?
2006-06-04T08:08:00.000Z	Sub	centipeed	get the actual numbers from your manufacturere
2006-06-04T08:10:00.000Z	centipeed	Sub	How do I add stuff to xorg.conf?
2006-06-04T08:11:00.000Z	Sub	centipeed	you need to edit it as root, use "sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf"
2006-06-04T08:13:00.000Z	centipeed	Sub	Is it case sensitive? I get a blank file when I type that into Terminal
2006-06-04T08:13:00.000Z	Sub	centipeed	yes it is.
2006-06-04T08:14:00.000Z	Sub	centipeed	and if one TAB does nothing, double tap to see possiblities.
2006-06-04T08:16:00.000Z	centipeed	Sub	Nevermind, done the Vertical Refresh
