2010-07-27T17:21:00.000Z	metalgeek		Hi have linked my ubuntu and windows to the same ad-hoc network (wireless) however i cant even ping the other computer let alone share files, any help would be grand?
2010-07-27T17:22:00.000Z	gogeta1	metalgeek	ad-hoc can be strange is it getting a ip
2010-07-27T17:22:00.000Z	metalgeek	gogeta1	Sorry i don't understand, is what getting an ip
2010-07-27T17:24:00.000Z	metalgeek	gogeta1	i understand what an ip is i just don't understand your question
2010-07-27T17:24:00.000Z	gogeta1	metalgeek	i asked if the ad-hoc was getting a ip
2010-07-27T17:25:00.000Z	metalgeek	gogeta1	Both of the machines on the ad-hoc have manually set ip's in the same subnet mask
2010-07-27T17:25:00.000Z	gogeta1	metalgeek	when i ad-hoc my psp under ubuntu i had to set it to link only
2010-07-27T17:25:00.000Z	metalgeek	gogeta1	not an idiot just a noob to linux
2010-07-27T17:26:00.000Z	gogeta1	metalgeek	otherwise it would not get a ip adress
2010-07-27T17:26:00.000Z	metalgeek	gogeta1	my psp works fine
2010-07-27T17:27:00.000Z	gogeta1	metalgeek	if i rember my ad-hoc both machines need to have the same ip for the link to work
2010-07-27T17:28:00.000Z	gogeta1	metalgeek	and thats probly confusing the hell out of samba
2010-07-27T17:29:00.000Z	metalgeek	gogeta1	if both machines have the same ip how will the network tell the difference
2010-07-27T17:30:00.000Z	gogeta1	metalgeek	ad-hoc is a odd mode i just rember a guide on it saying the ips need to be the same
2010-07-27T17:32:00.000Z	gogeta1	metalgeek	You should now be connected to the ad hoc network. Use the iwconfig  command to view the cell being used. This must match the same cell on  the other PCs that you want to connect to.

2010-07-27T17:34:00.000Z	metalgeek	gogeta1	your the best cheers
2010-07-27T17:34:00.000Z	gogeta1	metalgeek	i beleve the network manager works with ad-hoc now
