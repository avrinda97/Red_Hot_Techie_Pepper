2007-10-15T06:43:00.000Z	soundray	nucco	you should at least specify fat32. In any case, that question needed more information.
2007-10-15T06:44:00.000Z	nucco	soundray	vfat == fat32
2007-10-15T06:44:00.000Z	soundray	nucco	wrong
2007-10-15T06:45:00.000Z	nucco	soundray	explain please
2007-10-15T06:45:00.000Z	soundray	nucco	no, you made the mistake, you go and do the research.
2007-10-15T06:45:00.000Z	nucco	soundray	I'm not in school. thanks.
2007-10-15T06:45:00.000Z	soundray	nucco	I don't care, as long as you don't spread misinformation
2007-10-15T06:46:00.000Z	nucco	soundray	all you had to do was say a word hinting the right thing. I was going to research anyway, to verify your claim.
2007-10-15T06:47:00.000Z	soundray	nucco	okay, I was being a bit harsh. Peace?
2007-10-15T06:47:00.000Z	nucco	soundray	no offence.
2007-11-16T18:02:00.000Z	soundray	nucco	it's a good idea to dual boot between dapper and a fresh install of the latest
2007-11-16T18:03:00.000Z	nucco	soundray	dapper happens to not support most of my hardware. but it works fine if i chose to work with a cripled system
2007-11-16T18:04:00.000Z	soundray	nucco	does gutsy run well off the live CD, or is that frustrating, too?
2007-11-16T18:05:00.000Z	nucco	soundray	the lack of persistence on the livecd isn't so useful
2007-11-16T18:05:00.000Z	soundray	nucco	I'm asking because I was going to suggest a fresh install
2007-11-16T18:05:00.000Z	nucco	soundray	my install is about a week old. i haven't used software from outside official repositories
2007-11-16T18:06:00.000Z	nucco	soundray	yesterday, i applied the available updates, today i realised i no longer had DRI
2007-11-16T18:07:00.000Z	nucco	soundray	i would've downgraded, but compiz works much better after the updates... leaves me in a fix.
