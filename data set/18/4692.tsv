2009-03-03T05:12:00.000Z	Wildburn	uncategorized	cant you just reinstall it with synaptic? change your sources list to the intrepid ones first
2009-03-03T05:12:00.000Z	uncategorized	Wildburn	there are no more jaunty servers in sources.list
2009-03-03T05:13:00.000Z	Wildburn	uncategorized	try recovery console and fix broken packages
2009-03-03T05:15:00.000Z	uncategorized	Wildburn	can i initiate a fix broken packages without a recovery console?  just from the tty1
2009-03-03T05:15:00.000Z	Wildburn	uncategorized	believe so, but one of the more experienced CLIers will have to tell you the command
2009-03-03T05:17:00.000Z	uncategorized	Wildburn	don't have a CD and would rather not create one...seems unneccessary...i should be able to do it from any command line
2009-03-03T05:17:00.000Z	Wildburn	uncategorized	you dont need a cd for recovery, reboot hit esc when grub is up
2009-03-03T05:20:00.000Z	Wildburn	uncategorized	do you have your install media?
2009-03-03T05:21:00.000Z	uncategorized	Wildburn	no i am going from feisty
2009-03-03T05:21:00.000Z	uncategorized	Wildburn	errr...i originally installed from edgy
2009-03-03T05:21:00.000Z	Wildburn	uncategorized	does your sources list contain the backports link?
