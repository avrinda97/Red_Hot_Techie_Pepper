2012-01-24T04:05:00.000Z	kaddi		bobothatfix ed it though
2012-01-24T04:07:00.000Z	kaddi		no, i meant I screwed up the VB install badly. I've moved files around a bit too much in order to free up space and half the Vms have quite working on me while others are getting erratic
2012-01-24T04:07:00.000Z	kaddi		it would be best if I started out new, but I have some 10VMs configured and I don't want to redo them all >.>
2012-01-24T04:08:00.000Z	kaddi		though i have porbbably wasted more time saving the config than it would have taken to start new
2012-01-24T04:08:00.000Z	seangibbz	kaddi	shouldn't the VMs be saved in a seperate place than the actual VM program
2012-01-24T04:09:00.000Z	kaddi	seangibbz	the are by default saved in .Virtualbox in your home directory
2012-01-24T04:09:00.000Z	seangibbz	kaddi	if so, then just backup the VMs, reinstall the virtualization program, and put back the VM files
2012-01-24T04:09:00.000Z	kaddi		which in myc ase has 20GB, becuase i have a big ntfs data partition i share between linux and windows..
2012-01-24T04:09:00.000Z	kaddi		i may have messed a bit with the xml files >.>
2012-01-24T04:10:00.000Z	seangibbz	kaddi	ah
2012-01-24T04:10:00.000Z	seangibbz		dave: where did you get the ubuntu disc?
2012-01-24T04:11:00.000Z	seangibbz	kaddi	you could remaking the VMS, but once they're made (don't bother actually installing anything on them) replace the virtual hard disk of the new VM with the one from the old VM.
2012-01-24T04:12:00.000Z	kaddi	seangibbz	that won't work due to the intenral identifiers
2012-01-24T04:12:00.000Z	seangibbz		ah
2012-01-24T04:12:00.000Z	kaddi		if i could just point an existing VM to an existing screen shot I would be fine
2012-01-24T04:12:00.000Z	kaddi		i'll work it out eventually, at least for the ones I really need.. but for now, I'll just start over new
2012-01-24T04:12:00.000Z	kaddi		i think
2012-01-24T04:14:00.000Z	seangibbz	kaddi	you could still try.  Say, for example, you have a VM with a virtual hard disk "vm1.vhd".  You could just back that up, then delete it from the folder that it was originally stored in.  Then make a new VM with a new virtual hard disk also titled "vm1.vhd", then exit the program, put back the old vhd, overriding the new one, and restart the program.
