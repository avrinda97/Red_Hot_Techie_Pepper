2005-05-21T07:52:00.000Z	nubious		does anyone know if I can do that with vino, or do I need the actual vncserver ?
2005-05-21T07:54:00.000Z	nubious		well
2005-05-21T07:54:00.000Z	nubious		my setup goes like this
2005-05-21T07:54:00.000Z	nubious		I have a windows machine
2005-05-21T07:54:00.000Z	nubious		well
2005-05-21T07:54:00.000Z	nubious		I mean, I'd LIKE to not have to login to X
2005-05-21T07:54:00.000Z	nubious		(on the local machine)
2005-05-21T07:54:00.000Z	geppy	nubious	ssh is fun
2005-05-21T07:55:00.000Z	nubious		just start up a session via my windows machine
2005-05-21T07:55:00.000Z	nubious		I have that setup too
2005-05-21T07:55:00.000Z	nubious		I mean I guess it's not that big a deal
2005-05-21T07:55:00.000Z	nubious		here's what I would like to accomplish though
2005-05-21T07:55:00.000Z	nubious		if my girlfriend is playing games in gnome
2005-05-21T07:55:00.000Z	geppy	nubious	Sorry to ask the obvious, but why not use ssh to start up vnc when you need it?
2005-05-21T07:55:00.000Z	nubious		Iw ant to be able to have a seperate gnome session on my machine that I can control - my gf would be sitting on the local machine tho
2005-05-21T07:55:00.000Z	geppy	nubious	You could have a second X server, if that's what you're wanting.
2005-05-21T07:56:00.000Z	nubious	geppy	I didn't realise that was an option..  see from what I understand, 'vino' autostarts with gnome..  how do I setup a second x server?
2005-05-21T07:56:00.000Z	geppy	nubious	startx -- :2
