2007-08-09T13:03:00.000Z	rosegrass		How Ubuntu handles new packages in Debian which has older version number?
2007-08-09T13:04:00.000Z	rosegrass		For example, a package is 20060101-1 in Ubuntu but 0.0.20070101 in Debian..
2007-08-09T13:05:00.000Z	MasterShrek	rosegrass	you could install, but its a debian pacakge and may not run correctly
2007-08-09T13:05:00.000Z	rosegrass	MasterShrek	I mean how Ubuntu sync from Debian if that happens?
2007-08-09T13:05:00.000Z	MasterShrek		gedit
2007-08-09T13:06:00.000Z	MasterShrek		sudo /usr/bin/gedit /etc/apt/sources.list
2007-08-09T13:06:00.000Z	MasterShrek		oh
2007-08-09T13:06:00.000Z	MasterShrek		lol
2007-08-09T13:06:00.000Z	MasterShrek		you dont have a gui
2007-08-09T13:06:00.000Z	rosegrass	MasterShrek	a package was in Ubuntu has version "20060101-1" but Debian now maintain it too and use "0.0.20070101-1" for version number...
2007-08-09T13:07:00.000Z	MasterShrek	rosegrass	ubuntu doesnt sync from debian
2007-08-09T13:07:00.000Z	MasterShrek		they build their own pacakges
2007-08-09T13:07:00.000Z	MasterShrek		no Shaye
2007-08-09T13:07:00.000Z	MasterShrek		just do this:  sudo vi /etc/apt/sources.list
2007-08-09T13:07:00.000Z	rosegrass	MasterShrek	Ubuntu sync from Debian sid periodically...I think..
2007-08-09T13:08:00.000Z	MasterShrek		hmm maybe, i just assumed they build their own pacakges
2007-08-09T13:08:00.000Z	MasterShrek		hes going to comment out the cdrom in the file
2007-08-09T13:09:00.000Z	rosegrass	MasterShrek	if that package was not in Ubuntu, sync is easy..
