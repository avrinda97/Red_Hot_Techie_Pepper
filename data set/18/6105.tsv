2008-06-29T16:43:00.000Z	crm		can anyone recommend a partition for a 650G hdd? (4G mem)
2008-06-29T16:44:00.000Z	dr_Willis	crm	 Clarify that a bit?
2008-06-29T16:44:00.000Z	dr_Willis	crm	 you want suggestions as to a partition LAYOUT for such a machine?
2008-06-29T16:45:00.000Z	crm	dr_Willis	well, i have read that the swap should easily be 2xmem size.. then i would like a partition for storage .. accessible by windows and linux
2008-06-29T16:45:00.000Z	crm	dr_Willis	so.. other than /home .. are there any other linux drive partitions i should consider?
2008-06-29T16:46:00.000Z	dr_Willis	crm	swap only needs to be 2x mem if you are going to use hibernate/suspend.
2008-06-29T16:46:00.000Z	dr_Willis	crm	 i just use / /home and swap normally
2008-06-29T16:46:00.000Z	dr_Willis	crm	 most people dont gain much by being more complex.
2008-06-29T16:46:00.000Z	crm	dr_Willis	sounds good
2008-06-29T16:47:00.000Z	dr_Willis	crm	 windows can read/write ext2/3 now. :) not that safe.. but it can be done.
2008-06-29T16:48:00.000Z	dr_Willis	crm	 and linux can handle ntfs decently well now a days
2008-06-29T16:48:00.000Z	crm	dr_Willis	so you're saying ext3 or ntfs?
2008-06-29T16:49:00.000Z	dr_Willis	crm	 basically. :) since you dotn want fat32... thats all thats left.
2008-06-29T16:49:00.000Z	crm	dr_Willis	which one do you recommend?
2008-06-29T16:49:00.000Z	dr_Willis	crm	 depends on your needs. and which os you will be usiong most
2008-06-29T16:59:00.000Z	crm	dr_Willis	try to get with the program
2008-06-29T16:59:00.000Z	dr_Willis	crm	 :)
2008-06-29T16:59:00.000Z	dr_Willis	crm	 i had a similer argument with the guys at work who were 'serious everquest players' :)
