2011-10-16T14:14:00.000Z	zeroinf		Hello. I upgraded from 11.04 to 11.10 yesterday and I can not login anymore. At the login screen, I enter my login/Pass, the screen becomes black and... return to the login screen. (when my password is wrong it jsut says it to me)
2011-10-16T14:15:00.000Z	zeroinf		I can not log my user account but I can log with the "guest" one
2011-10-16T14:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zeroinf	what happens when you try to log in?
2011-10-16T14:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zeroinf	how much free space does the system have?
2011-10-16T14:18:00.000Z	zeroinf	ActionParsnip	: When I try to log with my account : the password is "validated" and the screen becomes black. Then after 1 seconde the login screen appears again.
2011-10-16T14:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zeroinf	how much free space do you have?
2011-10-16T14:19:00.000Z	zeroinf	ActionParsnip	what is the command line to see that ? (because I can log with the CTRL+ALT+F1)
2011-10-16T14:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zeroinf	df -h
2011-10-16T14:20:00.000Z	zeroinf	ActionParsnip	15go free
2011-10-16T14:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zeroinf	ok that's fine. ok, run:  sudo chown $USER:$USER $HOME     I assume you are logged in as the troublesome user
2011-10-16T14:22:00.000Z	zeroinf	ActionParsnip	ok I just ran it.
2011-10-16T14:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zeroinf	you'll get a warning about .gvfs
2011-10-16T14:23:00.000Z	zeroinf	ActionParsnip	yes, permission denied
2011-10-16T14:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zeroinf	thats fine, ok try and log in
2011-10-16T14:25:00.000Z	zeroinf	ActionParsnip	does not work. Only the Guest Session can log in, my user session is just accessible in console mode. Maybe a gnome/driver/... conflict ?
2011-10-16T14:29:00.000Z	zeroinf	ActionParsnip	Login sucessfull, with a savage method : I moved all my ~/.* directories in a backup directory
2011-10-16T14:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	zeroinf	i see,I guess if it works :)
2011-10-16T14:31:00.000Z	zeroinf	ActionParsnip	Thanks anyway. Goodbye
