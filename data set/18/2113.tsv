2012-02-25T02:33:00.000Z	rypervenche	yshavit	Ouch
2012-02-25T02:33:00.000Z	rypervenche	yshavit	I think the "I'm not a noob" excuse just died when you messaged a bot :X
2012-02-25T02:34:00.000Z	yshavit	rypervenche	not at all, it just reinforces the "I'm too tired to think" excuse.
2012-02-25T02:34:00.000Z	rypervenche	yshavit	I hope you're not on the computer you deleted the stuff from.
2012-02-25T02:35:00.000Z	rypervenche	yshavit	Get on a live distro right away if you are.
2012-02-25T02:35:00.000Z	yshavit	rypervenche	why's that?
2012-02-25T02:35:00.000Z	rypervenche	yshavit	The more you use the hard disk, the more chance you will overwrite your data.
2012-02-25T02:36:00.000Z	yshavit	rypervenche	meh, at this point I'm not too worried about recovering anything. It didn't run long, and anything important is backed up. I mostly want to see what got deleted so I can know what to recreate.
2012-02-25T02:37:00.000Z	rypervenche	yshavit	If you've got a backup of your home you could diff the two, that's about all I can think of right now.
2012-02-25T02:38:00.000Z	yshavit	rypervenche	nope. So far, the only symptom is that opening a new terminal tells me how to run a command as administrator.
2012-02-25T02:39:00.000Z	rypervenche	yshavit	Who knows with which files it started.
2012-02-25T02:39:00.000Z	yshavit	rypervenche	not I! But I figure I'll find out as things break. ;)
2012-02-25T02:39:00.000Z	yshavit	rypervenche	like I said, anything important is backed up anyway
2012-02-25T02:39:00.000Z	rypervenche	yshavit	Good luck.
2012-02-25T02:39:00.000Z	yshavit	rypervenche	thanks :)
2012-02-25T02:40:00.000Z	yshavit	rypervenche	maybe I should try (rm -rfv ~) and see if I can detect a pattern in what it deletes. Then I can work backwards to see what it would have deleted before!
2012-02-25T02:41:00.000Z	rypervenche	yshavit	I believe using an asterisk goes in alphabetical order, but when I've done full directories, I have yet to see a pattern. Probably where the inodes are located or something.
