2010-03-13T05:01:00.000Z	alzamabar	LinuxGuy2009	Sorry to poke you like that...But could you help? I'm running from LiveCD and would like to remove the linux-swap partition to recreate it at a second time. Can I do that without affecting my existing linux installation"
2010-03-13T05:01:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	alzamabar	Why would you do that?
2010-03-13T05:02:00.000Z	alzamabar	LinuxGuy2009	Because I have two partitions (one where my linux runs, one unallocated) and I'd like to extend my linux partition to use the unallocated space (through GParted). But in the middle there is the linux-swap partition
2010-03-13T05:03:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	alzamabar	You could use the live CD and use gparted to do the partition changes and then edit the fstab file with the changed UUIDs.
2010-03-13T05:03:00.000Z	alzamabar	LinuxGuy2009	I'm in LiveCD now :-)
2010-03-13T05:03:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	alzamabar	ok
2010-03-13T05:04:00.000Z	alzamabar	LinuxGuy2009	So I was thinking, I'm going to remove the linux-swap partition, extend the linux partition, and then re-create the linux-swap. Can I do that?
2010-03-13T05:04:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	alzamabar	Yes
2010-03-13T05:04:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	alzamabar	Dont lower the swap size lower than the installed physical ram.
2010-03-13T05:05:00.000Z	alzamabar	LinuxGuy2009	I was thinking of setting it up as double the size of my RAM
2010-03-13T05:05:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	alzamabar	You can. Thats a little big but will do just fine.
2010-03-13T05:05:00.000Z	alzamabar	LinuxGuy2009	You also said that I should edit /etc/fstab? Just by adding the newly-created linux-swap partition?
2010-03-13T05:07:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	alzamabar	If you change existing partition layout then Im pretty sure the UUID will change for the swap partition and maybe any that you resize but Im not sure how exactly what the criteria are for that.
2010-03-13T05:07:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	alzamabar	But you want to double check. If any of the partitions mentioned in fstab are wrong such as the root partition then you wont be booting on restart.
2010-03-13T05:08:00.000Z	alzamabar	LinuxGuy2009	Now I have my linux partition and some unallocated space, but GParted will not allow me to extend the linux partition using the unallocated space. Is there anything I should do first?
2010-03-13T05:09:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	alzamabar	The empty space need to be directly to the right of whateer partition you want to extend.
2010-03-13T05:09:00.000Z	alzamabar	LinuxGuy2009	Geez, it's on the left, what can I do now?
2010-03-13T05:10:00.000Z	LinuxGuy2009	alzamabar	Make sure you know how to edit the fstab or your gonna screw your install.
