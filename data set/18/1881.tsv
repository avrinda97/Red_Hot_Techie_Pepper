2011-01-27T22:47:00.000Z	KM0201	error21	what is your problem now?
2011-01-27T22:47:00.000Z	KM0201	error21	what is !paste going to help you with that for?
2011-01-27T22:49:00.000Z	KM0201	error21	go to paste.ubuntu.com   paste your terminal there (when you can't install GCC.. click paste, then give us the link... it's not that difficult.

2011-01-27T22:50:00.000Z	KM0201	error21	you have to install gcc
2011-01-27T22:53:00.000Z	KM0201	error21	no, you're using a versio of ubuntu that is no longer supported...
