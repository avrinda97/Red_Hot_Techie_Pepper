2007-04-18T14:17:00.000Z	Nubbie		rivethead: yes it's quite simple, i just can't recall...
2007-04-18T14:17:00.000Z	mc44	Nubbie	change ekiga to not use esd perhaps?
2007-04-18T14:37:00.000Z	Nubbie	mc44	i have this thing, it might be related.
2007-04-18T14:38:00.000Z	Nubbie	mc44	ever since i upgraded to feisty, randomly a dialog will pop up as if i had just inserted a blank cd, which i hadn't.
2007-04-18T14:38:00.000Z	Nubbie	mc44	and it acts like it's mounted all the time, but there's nothing in the mount point.
2007-04-18T14:38:00.000Z	mc44	Nubbie	no idea, sorry :s
2007-04-18T14:38:00.000Z	Nubbie	mc44	do you know what might be causing this?
2007-04-18T14:39:00.000Z	Nubbie	mc44	ahh it's cool. i'll put up with it until i get my feisty cds
2007-04-24T09:28:00.000Z	mc44	Nubbie	no realplayer isnt in the feisty offical repos
