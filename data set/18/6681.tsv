2008-04-11T19:28:00.000Z	tenpaiyomi	amenado	It was the me having stupidly set it to /bin/shell instead of /bin/bash
2008-04-13T10:19:00.000Z	tenpaiyomi	amenado	I have postfix setup to with the users and domains stored in a mysql database, which it uses for authentication.  I have Sasl setup to where (from what I understand with my configurations) it's supposed to be using mysql, however no matter -what- I do, the authentication fails.
2008-04-13T10:20:00.000Z	tenpaiyomi	amenado	I know which database it is using.  I am using that same database and user schema for the IMAP authentication
2008-04-13T10:22:00.000Z	tenpaiyomi	amenado	within the /etc/postfix/sasl/smtpd.conf I have the information as per the ubuntu wiki

2008-04-13T10:31:00.000Z	tenpaiyomi	amenado	Yes
2008-04-13T10:33:00.000Z	tenpaiyomi	amenado	Those options, as well as about 10 different configuration types.  I've been at this for about 6 hours now
2008-04-13T10:36:00.000Z	tenpaiyomi	amenado	I got about 90% of the configuration done in roughly 30 minutes.  The other 5 1/2 hours have been trying to get mysql SMTP authentication working
2008-04-13T10:38:00.000Z	tenpaiyomi	amenado	I'm going through one right now which is making mention of pam

2008-04-13T10:41:00.000Z	tenpaiyomi	amenado	Not at all
2008-04-13T10:44:00.000Z	tenpaiyomi	amenado	Well, I read a bit past that to the postfix 2.x version and smtp auth with sasl.  The only problem is that when I telnet into localhost and issue a ehlo command, the available auths are all default (250-AUTH=PLAIN NTLM LOGIN DIGEST-MD5 CRAM-MD5)  The only ones I have configured are sql plain and login.  It acts as if it's not even reading the conf file
2008-04-13T10:49:00.000Z	tenpaiyomi	amenado	Alright, well, thank you for your help
2008-04-13T10:52:00.000Z	tenpaiyomi	amenado	pam-mysql is for postfix 1.x.  postfix 2.x and libsasl2 have sql support.  The only problem is I just can't get it to actually USE it
2008-04-13T10:54:00.000Z	tenpaiyomi	amenado	pwcheck_method: auxprop
2008-04-13T10:58:00.000Z	tenpaiyomi	amenado	no change.  And it still shows every single auth option, even though I only have 3 enabled.
