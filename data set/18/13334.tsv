2005-12-05T10:43:00.000Z	Anfaenger		i dont know what to insert into "command"
2005-12-05T10:44:00.000Z	Anfaenger		i have two commands which i use to type into console
2005-12-05T10:44:00.000Z	Amaranth	Anfaenger	What are they?
2005-12-05T10:45:00.000Z	Amaranth	Anfaenger	In "Command:" put `cd hlds_l && ./hlds_run -game cstrike`
2005-12-05T10:58:00.000Z	Amaranth	Anfaenger	A good way to see what is going on is to try to run the command in a terminal and look at what happens.
2005-12-05T10:59:00.000Z	Amaranth	Anfaenger	Once you get a one-line command that works in a terminal it should work in a menu entry.
2005-12-05T10:59:00.000Z	Amaranth	Anfaenger	what are you running from the terminal?
2005-12-05T11:00:00.000Z	Amaranth	Anfaenger	What happens if you run `cd hlds_l && ./hlds_run +game cstrike` in a terminal?
2005-12-05T11:01:00.000Z	Amaranth	Anfaenger	Open a new terminal and try it.
2005-12-05T11:02:00.000Z	Amaranth	Anfaenger	And that's the _exact_ same thing you put in your menu entry (minus the quotes, of course)
2005-12-05T11:03:00.000Z	Amaranth	Anfaenger	?
2005-12-05T11:05:00.000Z	Amaranth	Anfaenger	I don't know what that means.
2005-12-05T11:09:00.000Z	Amaranth	Anfaenger	Try `cd /home/<your username here>/hlds_l && ./hlds_run +game cstrike`
2005-12-05T11:10:00.000Z	Anfaenger	Amaranth	i tired it, same error message
2005-12-05T11:10:00.000Z	Amaranth	Anfaenger	I'm lost...
