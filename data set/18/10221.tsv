2007-02-14T14:03:00.000Z	scheuri	firephoto	thanks again....
2007-02-14T13:51:00.000Z	firephoto	scheuri	what version of ubuntu are you trying to install?
2007-02-14T13:51:00.000Z	scheuri	firephoto	I tried 6.06.1 and 7.04 Herd 3....
2007-02-14T13:52:00.000Z	scheuri	firephoto	actually even netinst of Etch
2007-02-14T13:52:00.000Z	firephoto	scheuri	the live cd or the alternate?
2007-02-14T13:52:00.000Z	scheuri	firephoto	alternate...
2007-02-14T13:53:00.000Z	firephoto	scheuri	that was broke, i think the latest daily might be fixed. the live cd should work with that though. feisty. edgy cd won't.
2007-02-14T13:53:00.000Z	scheuri	firephoto	do you know what is broke exactly? and why does edgy not work? is ICH8 too new?
2007-02-14T13:54:00.000Z	firephoto	scheuri	the edgy cd is missing the module for the ide controller. edgy + updates would work but that isn't much good for a new install.
2007-02-14T13:55:00.000Z	scheuri	firephoto	oh, that is actually bad...do you know which module that would be? and is it included in feisty?
2007-02-14T13:56:00.000Z	firephoto	scheuri	i'm running feisty on an intel dg965ss, works good.. mine uses the pata_marvell module, your might be the pata_jmicron module.
2007-02-14T13:57:00.000Z	scheuri	firephoto	heyheyhey...yes....jmicron rings a HUGE bell...its is exactly the name that appears during POST...so jmicron is broke and I need new feisty (daily), right?
2007-02-14T13:57:00.000Z	firephoto	scheuri	yep, should be fine. it's not really broken, just watch the updates carefully.
2007-02-14T13:58:00.000Z	scheuri	firephoto	I will...any hint if there is a good URL to get updated about the updates of feisty?
2007-02-14T13:59:00.000Z	firephoto	scheuri	http://lists.ubuntu.com/mailman/listinfo/feisty-changes
