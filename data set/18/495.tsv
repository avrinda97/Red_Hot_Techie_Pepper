2012-01-28T23:12:00.000Z	biohazard135		I'm back
2012-01-28T23:12:00.000Z	biohazard135		Ok, so ssh doesn't work on ubuntu, but does on windows. That's just for my server, it works for other people's.
2012-01-28T23:13:00.000Z	biohazard135		Both systems are ubuntu 11.10
2012-01-28T23:13:00.000Z	milamber	biohazard135	can you be more specific? is the client not working or a server?
2012-01-28T23:14:00.000Z	biohazard135	milamber	server works fine. the client (windows/putty) works fine, client (ubuntu) times out. hangs on "debug2: channel 0: output open -> closed"
2012-01-28T23:15:00.000Z	biohazard135	milamber	both ubuntu systems are 11.10, my network is fine, latency is fine, everything is IP based, no dns is used, everything is default config
2012-01-28T23:15:00.000Z	biohazard135	milamber	and my client (ubuntu) is a fresh install.
2012-01-28T23:17:00.000Z	biohazard135	milamber	oh, almost forgot, the dump from using -vvv is here (http://paste.ubuntu.com/820274/)
2012-01-28T23:17:00.000Z	milamber	biohazard135	looking now
2012-01-28T23:19:00.000Z	biohazard135	milamber	it hangs on the last line. i wonder if this is firewall based or something, it works fine on windows (putty)
2012-01-28T23:24:00.000Z	milamber	biohazard135	did you try a different client on the ubuntu install?
2012-01-28T23:24:00.000Z	biohazard135	milamber	the only other one is the file explorer which can view/edit files.
2012-01-28T23:25:00.000Z	biohazard135	milamber	any ideas of other ssh clients i can try out? it's odd that it works in putty (windows ssh client)
2012-01-28T23:25:00.000Z	milamber		!info putty maverick
2012-01-28T23:26:00.000Z	biohazard135	milamber	didn't know putty was also for ubuntu, i'll try it
2012-01-28T23:29:00.000Z	biohazard135	milamber	wow... putty works fine
2012-01-28T23:32:00.000Z	biohazard135	milamber	ok so putty is able to connect on ubuntu, what could be preventing the native client from working
2012-01-28T23:33:00.000Z	milamber	biohazard135	openssh is tied to several other services unfortunately. if you would file a bug report that would be good.
