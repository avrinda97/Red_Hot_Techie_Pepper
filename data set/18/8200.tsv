2007-09-25T08:34:00.000Z	sensae	HealthyElija2	I had it working 30 minutes ago before my system stopped booting
2007-09-25T08:35:00.000Z	HealthyElija2	sensae	that is a bummer
2007-09-25T08:35:00.000Z	HealthyElija2	sensae	how long have you been a synergy user
2007-09-25T08:35:00.000Z	sensae	HealthyElija2	Today
2007-09-25T08:41:00.000Z	sensae	HealthyElija2	Are you trying to set up synergy on ubuntu as the server?
2007-09-25T08:42:00.000Z	HealthyElija2	sensae	Yes
2007-09-25T08:43:00.000Z	sensae	HealthyElija2	From what I was seeing there is none
2007-09-25T08:43:00.000Z	sensae	HealthyElija2	You create one yourself, then point synergy to it with the terminal command
2007-09-25T08:44:00.000Z	sensae	HealthyElija2	http://synergy2.sourceforge.net/ just make one at /etc/synergy.conf then when you run synergys you point it to it
2007-09-25T08:45:00.000Z	sensae	HealthyElija2	synergys -f --config /etc/synergy.conf
2007-09-25T08:45:00.000Z	HealthyElija2	sensae	that loses me
2007-09-25T08:46:00.000Z	sensae	HealthyElija2	Run that command if you put your config in /etc/synergy.conf
2007-09-25T08:47:00.000Z	HealthyElija2	sensae	When I copy that default config text it gives me all the white space before the text , is this right?
2007-09-25T08:47:00.000Z	HealthyElija2	sensae	should i remove the text
2007-09-25T08:48:00.000Z	sensae	HealthyElija2	the whitespace shouldn't matter, but you need to make sure you have a correct config
2007-09-25T08:49:00.000Z	HealthyElija2	sensae	k, i will fill in ips now
2007-09-25T08:52:00.000Z	HealthyElija2	sensae	is that the best place to put teh cinfig file in the .etc folder?
