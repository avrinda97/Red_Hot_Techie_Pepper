2004-10-08T13:19:00.000Z	|trey|	ema	they kinda simplified the installer... it asks you very basic questions, then just installs the OS...

2004-10-08T13:20:00.000Z	ema	|trey|	during the second one there were some problems and some packages failed to install
2004-10-08T13:21:00.000Z	|trey|	ema	why'd you reinstall?
