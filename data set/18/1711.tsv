2010-12-17T13:13:00.000Z	i5noc^3		a command line system is less than the server install sir
2010-12-17T13:13:00.000Z	i5noc^3		no matter how many times you try to say otherwise
2010-12-17T13:14:00.000Z	i5noc^3		sup
2010-12-17T13:14:00.000Z	i5noc^3		fighting ignorance as per usual ~_^

2010-12-17T13:15:00.000Z	Myrtti	i5noc^3	minimal iso is the basis of all installation options, including server, alternate and desktop. server includes in addition to the minimal server optimized kernels and modules. alternate can be is meaningful only with desktop installations with quirky hardware or encryption or other more advanced needs.
2010-12-17T13:15:00.000Z	i5noc^3		ok tell you what. why dont i do a server install then a command-line install, df -h both, and do a dpkg -l > file and a diff
2010-12-17T13:16:00.000Z	i5noc^3		will you accept my correctness then if i PROVE it?
2010-12-17T13:16:00.000Z	i5noc^3	Myrtti	wrong sorry
2010-12-17T13:16:00.000Z	i5noc^3		!lowmem | Myrtti
2010-12-17T13:16:00.000Z	Myrtti	i5noc^3	ActionParsnip: take it to #ubuntu-offtopic in any case
2010-12-17T13:16:00.000Z	i5noc^3	Myrtti	im not taking it there, ActionParsnip seems to think its ok to spread ignorance in chan. its important for channel logs to have the correct info next to the tainted
2010-12-17T13:17:00.000Z	Myrtti	i5noc^3	ActionParsnip: fighting about it here is counter productive to the actual topic of this channel, which is support
