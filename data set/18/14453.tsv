2005-07-27T06:04:00.000Z	Cooner750		how long does a Ubuntu install take?
2005-07-27T06:04:00.000Z	Cooner750		(forever?)_
2005-07-27T06:04:00.000Z	Cooner750		do I have to use the Install CD
2005-07-27T06:05:00.000Z	Cooner750		and what bootloader should I use?
2005-07-27T06:06:00.000Z	Cooner750		My hardware is a Pavilion a720n Athlon 3200+ with 512MB RAM
2005-07-27T06:06:00.000Z	Cooner750		and a usb 2.0 external
2005-07-27T06:06:00.000Z	Cooner750		Now I just have to wait for the install .iso to download
2005-07-27T06:06:00.000Z	Cooner750		15%
2005-07-27T06:07:00.000Z	Cooner750		13 min remaining
2005-07-27T06:09:00.000Z	Cooner750		what bootloader should I use? (and one that's safe to install?) ? Or just use the XP boot menu?
2005-07-27T06:10:00.000Z	cw2	Cooner750	grub or lilo, xp's is weak
2005-07-27T06:18:00.000Z	cw2	Cooner750	does you mobo support booting off an external usb disk?
2005-07-27T06:18:00.000Z	Cooner750	cw2	yes
2005-07-27T06:20:00.000Z	cw2	Cooner750	set it as first and write grub to the usb disk.  you'll be lucky if it comes with an initrd that has the usb-storage module though
2005-07-27T06:22:00.000Z	cw2	Cooner750	did it comes with a restore cd?
2005-07-27T06:22:00.000Z	Cooner750	cw2	I think so. I'd have to look'
2005-07-27T06:54:00.000Z	cw2	Cooner750	boot of the cd
2005-07-27T06:54:00.000Z	cw2	Cooner750	then mount and chroot
