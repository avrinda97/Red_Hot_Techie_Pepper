2004-10-10T15:09:00.000Z	neighborlee		I just changed ( via chown) a DIR so I can extract tarballs ( /usr/local/games/) but its still refusing me..and I think thats wude!
2004-10-10T15:09:00.000Z	neighborlee		the chown command usually works ;-)
2004-10-10T15:09:00.000Z	Kinnison	neighborlee	you may need to extract the tarball using 'sudo tar' rather than 'tar' since a normal user can't write to /usr/local/games
2004-10-10T15:10:00.000Z	neighborlee	Kinnison	well
2004-10-10T15:10:00.000Z	neighborlee	Kinnison	im using fileroller which is hooked into mozillla
2004-10-10T15:10:00.000Z	Kinnison	neighborlee	aah. Hmm
2004-10-10T15:10:00.000Z	neighborlee	Kinnison	lemme try prefs in mozilla
2004-10-10T15:10:00.000Z	Kinnison	neighborlee	Make a directory called 'Games' in your homespace ?
2004-10-10T15:10:00.000Z	Kinnison	neighborlee	and extract it to there?
2004-10-10T15:11:00.000Z	neighborlee	Kinnison	well ..I like to  use /usr/local in case I add users 
2004-10-10T15:11:00.000Z	Kinnison	neighborlee	You could extract it into your homespace to begin with; then use 'sudo mv' to move the install into /usr/local/games ?
2004-10-10T15:11:00.000Z	neighborlee		rad..what a surprise to see firefox 1.0 preview !! in unbuntu..sweet
2004-10-10T15:12:00.000Z	neighborlee	Kinnison	yes I could..i'm going to try sudo tar first
2004-10-10T15:12:00.000Z	Kinnison	neighborlee	*nod*
2004-10-10T15:14:00.000Z	Kinnison	neighborlee	How's it going?
2004-10-10T15:14:00.000Z	neighborlee		I guess fileroller isn't linked in mozilla..must be mime types
2004-10-10T15:14:00.000Z	neighborlee		lol
2004-10-10T15:22:00.000Z	neighborlee	Kinnison	I just did a chmod on it and voila LOL
