2007-08-27T13:49:00.000Z	Parisi	Aishiko	Most people would recommend you a Dell, i dont know, i am not a big fan of PC laptops.
2007-08-27T13:50:00.000Z	Parisi	Aishiko	I know alot of people like the IBM's, your best bet would be to try them for yourself, and compare specs.
2007-08-27T13:51:00.000Z	Parisi	Aishiko	What is your budget?
2007-08-27T13:53:00.000Z	Parisi	Aishiko	I would probably look into Dell's, i hear HP are OK, but i personally cant stand them, $500-700 is not a whole lot for a nice laptop, what size factor?
2007-08-27T13:55:00.000Z	Parisi	Aishiko	I bought an Acer recently for $450, but i didnt like a few things so i returned it, (mostly weak audio from speaker/soundcard) it was still decent at that price range.
2007-08-27T13:56:00.000Z	Parisi	Aishiko	I understand your frustration, not an apple fan?
2007-08-27T14:00:00.000Z	Parisi	Aishiko	if you go to the store and bring a CD, they could care less good idea.
2007-08-27T14:01:00.000Z	Parisi	Aishiko	If could also buy and return it, but they give you a 14 day, and you can only exchange it for a different laptop otherwise you are looking at a %15 restocking fee.
2007-08-27T14:02:00.000Z	Parisi	Aishiko	I do not think so, thats a good idea.
2007-08-27T14:03:00.000Z	Parisi	Aishiko	But you can get evrything to run under Linux anyways.
2007-08-27T14:05:00.000Z	Parisi	Aishiko	The only laptop i ever really liked was a 12'' Powerbook, :)
2007-08-27T14:07:00.000Z	Parisi	Aishiko	 :) so you should be alright with a budget laptop, just be ready to spend at least $600, and that should give you a dual processor 1 gig ram, and a fairly decent screen.
2007-08-27T14:11:00.000Z	Parisi	Aishiko	I would not worry much, the dual processor and extra ram should make up for it whatever comes default, i would take more RAM and a faster CPU over that any days.
2007-08-27T14:12:00.000Z	Parisi	Aishiko	but yeah, thats a good upgrade too i would think.
2007-08-27T14:13:00.000Z	Parisi	Aishiko	I hear you, i have 3 gigs of ram on my desktop :)
2007-08-27T14:14:00.000Z	Parisi	Aishiko	Nice.
2007-08-27T14:20:00.000Z	Parisi	Aishiko	How old are you?
