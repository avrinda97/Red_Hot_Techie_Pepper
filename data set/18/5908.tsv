2008-08-03T13:51:00.000Z	adilson		cna anyone help me set my resolution in xorg.conf the ones ive tried are not being picked up?
2008-08-03T13:52:00.000Z	tab_shift	adilson	now xorg auto detects resolution , you need to change it with xrandr extension
2008-08-03T13:53:00.000Z	adilson	tab_shift	how do i do that?
2008-08-03T13:54:00.000Z	adilson	tab_shift	i.e. xrandr 1024x768 would that be an acceptable command?
2008-08-03T13:54:00.000Z	tab_shift	adilson	sont remember the exact syntax, look up "man xrandr", i don;t have access to xrandr right now
2008-08-03T13:55:00.000Z	adilson	tab_shift	np thanx will check it out otherwise win for now been working on this for 2days now
2008-08-03T14:01:00.000Z	tab_shift	adilson	delete your xorg.conf, xorg should automatically shoose the most optimum resolution for you, if it doesn't then its a bug in xorg and you need to email them here xorg@freedesktop.org
