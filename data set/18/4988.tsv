2009-01-06T02:14:00.000Z	FireStorm		hey, the wubi installer isnt working for me, when i double click it nothing happens..
2009-01-06T02:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	FireStorm	did yuo md5 check the installer?
2009-01-06T02:15:00.000Z	FireStorm		no, but ive used the one on the site thats just he exe, also the one thats just on the ubuntu cd, i should also mention that its worked before and ive installed ubuntu but now i want to uninstall and reinstall, but even the uninstaller doesnt run
2009-01-06T02:17:00.000Z	FireStorm		id do cp instead of mv so you save a copy
2009-01-06T02:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	FireStorm	doesnt matter where you download it from ,  you ned to check the downloaded file is correct
2009-01-06T02:18:00.000Z	FireStorm		k how do i do that
2009-01-06T02:19:00.000Z	FireStorm		but shouldnt the uninstaller work since the installer originally worked
2009-01-06T02:19:00.000Z	FireStorm		i suspsect the problem is deeper
2009-01-06T02:20:00.000Z	FireStorm		since the exact same file works on my other machine
2009-01-06T02:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		!md5 | FireStorm
2009-01-06T02:25:00.000Z	FireStorm	ActionParsnip	none of the file names there match mine as mine is cd sized http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/releases/8.10/release/
2009-01-06T02:25:00.000Z	FireStorm		also i cant imagine what could go wrong in transfer of the file from wubi-installer.com or whatever since its worked on my other machines fine
2009-01-06T02:25:00.000Z	FireStorm		also none of that explains why my UNinstaller doesnt work
2009-01-06T02:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	FireStorm	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuHashes
2009-01-06T02:30:00.000Z	FireStorm	ActionParsnip	k md5s are the same
2009-01-06T02:31:00.000Z	FireStorm		ya something is wrong with my windows because the uninstaller of wubi doesnt work and the wubi installer doesnt work from the site AND on the cd so does anyone know what is required to run the wubi installer/uninstaller
2009-01-06T02:31:00.000Z	FireStorm		like some runtime or something
2009-01-06T02:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	FireStorm	cool
