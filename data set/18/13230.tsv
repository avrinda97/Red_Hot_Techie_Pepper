2005-12-22T10:06:00.000Z	angsty		I've been looking all over the forums for help on this, but found nothing useful... every time I try to install 5.10, it gets up to a dialog saying "setting up partitions..." then it goes to a blue screen with a grey line at the bottom and stays there. I left it on all night, nothing changed.
2005-12-22T10:06:00.000Z	angsty		it doesn't get far enough for me to actually choose what partition I want to use
2005-12-22T10:06:00.000Z	angsty		nope, checked the integrity of the cd
2005-12-22T10:07:00.000Z	angsty		no problems with it
2005-12-22T10:07:00.000Z	angsty		I've tried doing it a few different ways.. I have an ext3 partition preformatted that I was going to use, it didn't work that way
2005-12-22T10:07:00.000Z	angsty		and I tried it with an unformatted partition, same situation
2005-12-22T10:09:00.000Z	sethk	angsty	I had something similar that I worked around.  What happens exactly?  I didn't get the first part of what you were saying.
2005-12-22T10:10:00.000Z	angsty	sethk	it just uh, it dies
2005-12-22T10:11:00.000Z	sethk	angsty	do you have SATA, or promise IDE?
2005-12-22T10:14:00.000Z	sethk	angsty	, , can you disconnect the PCI/IDE just for the purpose of getting the install going?
2005-12-22T10:15:00.000Z	sethk	angsty	it is, but I think in this case it is necessary
2005-12-22T10:16:00.000Z	sethk	angsty	yes.  On my box, there is a problem in the BIOS that forks ubuntu up during install if the PCI/IDE is enabled
2005-12-22T10:18:00.000Z	sethk	angsty	after the install I used the PCI/IDE
2005-12-22T10:18:00.000Z	sethk	angsty	it is just that partitioning step that has the problem, at least on my box.
2005-12-22T10:21:00.000Z	sethk	angsty	after the install, as long as the "detect off board IDE first" flag is not set, everything works.
2005-12-22T10:21:00.000Z	angsty	sethk	ok
2005-12-22T10:21:00.000Z	sethk	angsty	in fact, I think the problem is that detect offboard first is set in the install kernel.
2005-12-22T10:21:00.000Z	sethk	angsty	although that's just a theory.
