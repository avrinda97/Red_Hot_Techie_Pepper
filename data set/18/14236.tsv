2010-05-07T17:47:00.000Z	melodie_		the first ordinary user : my 10 years old son, will start learning to deal with it, but I don't want to restore his windows if he screws it  because of this kind of stupid detail
2010-05-07T17:48:00.000Z	melodie_		incredible
2010-05-07T17:49:00.000Z	melodie_		the easiest may be to get rid of the mounting of theses directories
2010-05-07T17:50:00.000Z	morgan	melodie_	Mount read only.
2010-05-07T17:50:00.000Z	melodie_	morgan	that is also an idea
2010-05-07T17:50:00.000Z	melodie_	morgan	I should configure it in fstab to override the default choices : right ?
2010-05-07T17:50:00.000Z	morgan	melodie_	Edit the /etc/fstab and add the ro option.
2010-05-07T17:51:00.000Z	melodie_	morgan	I have to add a whole line : nothing is configured there. It should not even mount the windows boot partition !
2010-05-07T17:52:00.000Z	melodie_	morgan	I have almost finished updating, so I'll look if ntfs-3g is installed, from within Synaptic, just after
2010-05-07T17:54:00.000Z	morgan	melodie_	Type mount on it's own and it will list all mounts. Take the details you need from there - /dev/sda1 or whatever, mount point, etc. You seem to know what you're about anyway.
2010-05-07T17:54:00.000Z	melodie_	morgan	I do that, good idea
2010-05-07T17:57:00.000Z	melodie_	morgan	what would be the options in fstab to *not mount* theses ?
2010-05-07T17:59:00.000Z	melodie_		never ming
2010-05-07T17:59:00.000Z	melodie_		mind
2010-05-07T18:01:00.000Z	morgan	melodie_	Mine is listed in the fstab. If I remove that it doesn't mount. Is yours listed? Here's my mount line -  /dev/sda2  /windows ntfs-3g    defaults,nls=utf8,umask=007,gid=46 0       0
2010-05-07T18:02:00.000Z	morgan	melodie_	Replace defaults with ro, should do the job and allow access to files on the win system too.
2010-05-07T18:02:00.000Z	melodie_	morgan	so your umask is a 770 permission, if I want to forbid... well that doesn't change the problem : 3 win7 partitions over 3 are mounted
2010-05-07T18:02:00.000Z	melodie_	morgan	I don't want any to be mounted
