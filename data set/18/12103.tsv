2007-02-28T07:38:00.000Z	trelayne		hi all, for some reason, by apache2 process, when started up is like at 98% usage....
2007-02-28T07:39:00.000Z	trelayne		anyone hear of this before on Edgy?
2007-02-28T07:41:00.000Z	fryfrog	trelayne	so it starts, uses a lot of cpu ... then goes down to normal, low usage?
2007-02-28T07:41:00.000Z	fryfrog	trelayne	or stays at 98%?
2007-02-28T07:42:00.000Z	trelayne	fryfrog	it stays high
2007-02-28T07:42:00.000Z	trelayne		right now at 95, sometimes goes down to 88, but usually between 94 and 98
2007-02-28T07:42:00.000Z	trelayne		I notice that it's only one of the child processes that's doing this.... wanna see strace output?
2007-02-28T07:43:00.000Z	fryfrog	trelayne	okay, that is definatly not normal :)  what does the error_log and/or access_log say?
2007-02-28T07:43:00.000Z	fryfrog	trelayne	i'd not know what to make of an strace, sorry :(
2007-02-28T07:43:00.000Z	fryfrog	trelayne	are you hosting a lot of sites?
2007-02-28T07:43:00.000Z	trelayne		the error log and access log doesn't show anything strange or even corresponding to the hight load..
2007-02-28T07:44:00.000Z	trelayne		it's a closed system..... so only access from my private IP range
2007-02-28T07:44:00.000Z	trelayne	fryfrog	it's mainly for web development on my home PC........
2007-02-28T07:45:00.000Z	fryfrog		could it be some run-away crazy script or something that a person (or robot crawler) found?
2007-02-28T07:45:00.000Z	fryfrog		sorry, not sure what else i'd look at
2007-02-28T07:45:00.000Z	trelayne	fryfrog	 I don't think so. It's not accessible from the outside world
2007-02-28T07:45:00.000Z	fryfrog		ah
2007-02-28T07:47:00.000Z	trelayne	fryfrog	I just killed that one process.... the other kids are ok... it seems to have solved the problem.. but I am not sure why it does that... I hate that
