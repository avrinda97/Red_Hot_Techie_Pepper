2006-11-01T09:07:00.000Z	MTecknology		What was the command to monitor the data a device is processing? I tried cat /dev/ttyS1 to 7 but got an error "cat: /dev/ttyS1: Input/output error"
2006-11-01T09:08:00.000Z	kitche	MTecknology	is it a terminal device?
2006-11-01T09:08:00.000Z	MTecknology	kitche	it's a stylus
2006-11-01T09:10:00.000Z	MTecknology	kitche	do you know?
2006-11-01T09:10:00.000Z	kitche	MTecknology	nope
2006-12-29T06:41:00.000Z	kitche	MTecknology	it should already reconize it but what installer you using?
2006-12-29T06:41:00.000Z	MTecknology	kitche	Ubuntu Server 6.10 Text Install
2006-12-29T06:42:00.000Z	kitche	MTecknology	the mouse won't work in that install version cd anyways
2006-12-29T06:42:00.000Z	MTecknology	kitche	I can select the install option, but i lose keyboard after that
2006-12-29T06:42:00.000Z	MTecknology	kitche	the keyboard is PS2
2006-12-29T06:43:00.000Z	MTecknology	kitche	sorry, i meant i lose my keyboard
2006-12-29T06:43:00.000Z	kitche	MTecknology	hmm that is odd
2006-12-29T06:44:00.000Z	MTecknology	kitche	any ideas?
2006-12-29T06:45:00.000Z	kitche	MTecknology	not really since it seems to be part of the installer problem but you sure you lose it you can't press the up or down arrows and it won't move?
2006-12-29T06:46:00.000Z	MTecknology	kitche	it won't move and i also can't change the lights, such as caps and num lock
2006-12-29T06:48:00.000Z	MTecknology	kitche	you know of any boot param for the install that will recheck PS2 components?
2006-12-29T06:49:00.000Z	MTecknology	kitche	there are errors that show up but the are too quick for me to copy
2007-02-14T06:02:00.000Z	kitche	MTecknology	#ubuntu+1 for feisty support
