2009-01-22T08:41:00.000Z	Fishscene		I have created a directory called, "/vmfiles/vm" However, if I go into the vmfiles directory and run "ls" it does not display the vm directory. But I can still navigate to /vmfiles/vm. Any ideas why vm does not show up in ls?
2009-01-22T08:42:00.000Z	Fishscene		So no one has any idea why the "ls" command fails to execute properly? It works fine in all directories except the one I created.
2009-01-22T08:43:00.000Z	root______	Fishscene	no read permission on the dir ?
2009-01-22T08:43:00.000Z	Fishscene	arrenlex1	it doesn't say anything. I execute the command and it returns me to the prompt. No output
2009-01-22T08:44:00.000Z	Fishscene		root____, I thought if I created the directory using sudo, that I automatically had read permissions. how would I check the permissions?
2009-01-22T08:44:00.000Z	Fishscene	arrenlex1	just a subdirectory
2009-01-22T08:44:00.000Z	Fishscene		Here's the details: I have created a directory called, "/vmfiles/vm" However, if I go into the vmfiles directory and run "ls" it does not display the vm directory. But I can still navigate to /vmfiles/vm. Any ideas why vm does not show up in ls?
2009-01-22T08:44:00.000Z	root______	Fishscene	why did you use sudo ?    is the dir not in your home ?
2009-01-22T08:44:00.000Z	Fishscene		root_________ correct, it is a directory sitting on the root of the filesystem.
2009-01-22T08:45:00.000Z	root______	Fishscene	ok ls -l /   to see the ownership and permissions of the dir in question
2009-01-22T08:47:00.000Z	Fishscene		root___, this is the readout: http://pastebin.ubuntu-uk.org/46402
2009-01-22T08:48:00.000Z	Fishscene		wait! Holdup. Something goofy is going on.
2009-01-22T08:49:00.000Z	root______	Fishscene	you forgot the slash    ls -l /
2009-01-22T08:49:00.000Z	Fishscene		oh, I ran that command. At the very top of the pastebin is the relevent directory from that command
2009-01-22T08:49:00.000Z	Fishscene		but! I fixed the issue. Turns out to be a linux hiccup
2009-01-22T08:50:00.000Z	Fishscene		I restarted my machine and saw (bizzarrly) that my subdirectory moved itself to the root directory.
2009-01-22T08:50:00.000Z	Fishscene		Thanks for helping me out guys.
2009-01-22T08:50:00.000Z	root______	Fishscene	ah yes line one,,  1. drwxr-xr-x  2 root root  4096 2009-01-21 17:08 vmfiles    sorry.  anyway you have read access.   if you want write access you'll have to chmod it
