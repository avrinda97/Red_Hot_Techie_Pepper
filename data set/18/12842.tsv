2007-01-09T09:36:00.000Z	pomalley		hey folks--i'm trying to install vmware server on my machine but when i try to set the directory for the virtual machine files it says "Unable to change access rights" of the folder and stops. The folder in question is on a fat32 drive that i use to share between windows & linux. I had vmware working before, i swear, but I don't remember if this problem came up. (i am running it with root priviledges, of course.)
2007-01-09T09:36:00.000Z	pomalley		that's what i thought, but then how did i have it working before?
2007-01-09T09:36:00.000Z	pomalley		oh well
2007-01-09T09:37:00.000Z	auTONYmous	pomalley	I never got VMWare to run on anything but a native Linux partition. FAT32 and NTFS wouldn't work
2007-01-09T09:38:00.000Z	pomalley	auTONYmous	sorry. ugh.
2007-01-09T09:38:00.000Z	auTONYmous	pomalley	that's what I meant. You have to move the VM files off FAT32...
2007-01-09T09:39:00.000Z	pomalley	auTONYmous	yeah, but i had the VM files there before. i wiped my ubuntu when the edgy upgrade started, but the vm files were left over 'cause they were on the fat32
2007-01-09T09:39:00.000Z	pomalley	auTONYmous	and i distinctly remember storing them there and using them
2007-01-09T09:39:00.000Z	pomalley	auTONYmous	but maybe i'm just crazy
2007-01-09T09:39:00.000Z	auTONYmous	pomalley	well, you _could_ always try playing with the mount setuid and mount point permissions...good luck (never worked for me)
2007-01-09T09:40:00.000Z	pomalley	auTONYmous	yeah, maybe that's what i had going before, some crazy stuff like that. huh.
2007-01-09T09:41:00.000Z	pomalley	auTONYmous	you don't happen to remember what permissions vmware server requires?
2007-01-09T09:41:00.000Z	auTONYmous	pomalley	root owner, 644, I would imagine
2007-01-09T09:42:00.000Z	auTONYmous	pomalley	I don't use server anymore, so I can't confirm
2007-01-09T09:42:00.000Z	pomalley	auTONYmous	yeah, makes sense. i'll give it a shot.
2007-01-09T09:42:00.000Z	auTONYmous	pomalley	and I moved my VMs to a XFS disk, with solid vdisks
2007-01-09T09:44:00.000Z	pomalley	auTONYmous	yeah, i got the vmware station from the repositories but it wouldn't load up the saved VM i had b/c i had that VM set to 2 processors (like my cpu). i could have just rebuilt one, i guess, but i had that one set for my iTunes store account, and since you only have 5 authorizations, and it's always a pain to cancel them all and so on... you get the idea. besides, it's fun that way. or something.
2007-01-09T10:04:00.000Z	pomalley	auTONYmous	still here? i installed it using a folder on my ext3 for the virtual machines, and it works--i can load up the vm i have on my fat32
