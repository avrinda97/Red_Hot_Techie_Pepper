2010-02-06T02:12:00.000Z	kroson		im about to install karmic on my pc
2010-02-06T02:12:00.000Z	kroson		i need some advice
2010-02-06T02:12:00.000Z	kroson		what is the best mail client for ubuntu?
2010-02-06T02:12:00.000Z	kroson		i heard of thunderbird 3 but i think it doesnt come with karmic
2010-02-06T02:12:00.000Z	kroson		xD
2010-02-06T02:13:00.000Z	kroson		but what do you use more?
2010-02-06T02:13:00.000Z	kroson		what about thunderbird?
2010-02-06T02:14:00.000Z	kroson		there is the new version, version 3
2010-02-06T02:14:00.000Z	kroson		it seems that when new major versions of this software are released, we need to use ppa's to update software
2010-02-06T02:14:00.000Z	kroson		do you recommend using ppa's?
2010-02-06T02:15:00.000Z	meganerd	kroson	only use a PPA if you know what you are doing
2010-02-06T02:16:00.000Z	kroson	meganerd	i wil use wine ppa for sure xD
2010-02-06T02:16:00.000Z	meganerd	kroson	PPAs are for when you can't wait for the next release of Ubuntu
2010-02-06T02:16:00.000Z	meganerd	kroson	I have noticed no difference since I switched to the wine PPA
2010-02-06T02:17:00.000Z	meganerd	kroson	YMMV
2010-02-06T02:17:00.000Z	kroson	meganerd	sometimes you cant wait because ubuntu doesnt want to put new software on their newest releases
2010-02-06T02:17:00.000Z	kroson		they opt to delay that version for the next release
2010-02-06T02:19:00.000Z	meganerd	kroson	ubuntu does a pretty good job of balancing stability with the inclusion of recent releases
