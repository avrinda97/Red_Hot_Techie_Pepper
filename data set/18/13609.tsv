2005-10-30T13:08:00.000Z	EviLBorF_		How can I list the currently logged in users?
2005-10-30T13:08:00.000Z	madsen	EviLBorF_	'who'
2005-10-30T13:09:00.000Z	EviLBorF_		thx madsen.  My hard drive was goin crazy for some reason on my ubuntu server.  I am the only one logged in, and it shouldn't be accessible from the outside world, at least not in any publicized way.  Any idea what could be goin on?
2005-10-30T13:09:00.000Z	madsen	EviLBorF_	updatedb perhaps...
2005-10-30T13:10:00.000Z	EviLBorF_	madsen	updatedb?
2005-10-30T13:10:00.000Z	madsen	EviLBorF_	Try 'top' and see if 'find' is consuming a lot of resources.
2005-10-30T13:10:00.000Z	madsen	EviLBorF_	Yeah, it indexes everything, so you can use 'locate' to search for it fast. (WAY faster than with 'find'.)
2005-10-30T13:11:00.000Z	EviLBorF_	madsen	Is that something that ubuntu automatically does?  I haven't told it to do anything like that.
2005-10-30T13:12:00.000Z	madsen	EviLBorF_	Yeah, I think all linux distros does that. (My server (plain Debian) does it at 6:30am every day.)
2005-10-30T13:12:00.000Z	EviLBorF_		ok.  that would probably be it then.
2005-10-30T13:12:00.000Z	madsen	EviLBorF_	Try 'top' and see if 'find' is running.
2005-10-30T13:13:00.000Z	EviLBorF_	madsen	doesn't appear to be, however my hard drive isn't going nuts anymore.
2005-10-30T13:13:00.000Z	madsen	EviLBorF_	Sounds a lot like updatedb. :)
2005-10-30T13:15:00.000Z	EviLBorF_	madsen	doesn't say that update db is running, and when I run who it only shows me logged in
2005-10-30T13:15:00.000Z	madsen	EviLBorF_	Yeah, it's run from cron.
2005-10-30T13:15:00.000Z	madsen	EviLBorF_	'man cron'
2005-10-30T13:15:00.000Z	EviLBorF_		ok.  thats what i needed.  thanx man
2005-10-30T13:16:00.000Z	madsen	EviLBorF_	np :)
