2007-01-25T16:33:00.000Z	mixandgo		hello, how can I check if my laptop fan works ?
2007-01-25T16:34:00.000Z	m1r4g3	mixandgo	make your cpu burn and listen if your fan turns on
2007-01-25T16:35:00.000Z	mixandgo	m1r4g3	it blows air but I think it should go faster cause... it gets a bit hot
2007-01-25T16:35:00.000Z	m1r4g3	mixandgo	if you have a recent laptop, you can always install acpi and check with acpi -V: you will see the temp of your cpu
2007-01-25T16:36:00.000Z	mixandgo	m1r4g3	54 degrees C
2007-01-25T16:36:00.000Z	m1r4g3	mixandgo	otherwise you have to clean it
2007-01-25T16:36:00.000Z	mixandgo	m1r4g3	it's a new sony vaio dual core...
2007-01-25T16:36:00.000Z	m1r4g3	mixandgo	mine is 38
2007-01-25T16:37:00.000Z	mixandgo	m1r4g3	on my previus laptop the fan was rotating faster when heated
2007-01-25T16:37:00.000Z	mixandgo	m1r4g3	this one seems to rotate at a constant rate
2007-01-25T16:37:00.000Z	mixandgo	m1r4g3	I don't think that is normal
2007-01-25T16:38:00.000Z	m1r4g3	mixandgo	open a terminal and look with "top" if you don't have any crazy process
2007-01-25T16:38:00.000Z	mixandgo	m1r4g3	can I make it rotate faster or something ?
2007-01-25T16:38:00.000Z	mixandgo	m1r4g3	I don't
2007-01-25T16:39:00.000Z	mixandgo	m1r4g3	cpu is not at 100%
2007-01-25T16:39:00.000Z	m1r4g3	mixandgo	blow on it? no really u can try to use cpu frequency scaling
2007-01-25T16:40:00.000Z	mixandgo	m1r4g3	so there is just one speed ? for the fan
2007-01-25T16:40:00.000Z	m1r4g3	mixandgo	it seems so, but it should be possible to scale the cpu frequency
