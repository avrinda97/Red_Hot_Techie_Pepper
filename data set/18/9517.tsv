2010-08-14T17:52:00.000Z	coz_	mikebeecham	 is this from a mac to linux you want to do this?
2010-08-14T17:53:00.000Z	mikebeecham	coz_	yessir - from my mac min running itunes 9 to Ubuntu 10.04
2010-08-14T17:53:00.000Z	coz_	mikebeecham	  what you might want to try is to set up  "SharePoints"  on the mac to set up the share of itunes flder and then set the library location in rhythmbox  to the share
2010-08-14T17:55:00.000Z	coz_	mikebeecham	 you might have to "update" the shared folder  before it can be accessed by ubuntu rhythmbox
2010-08-14T17:56:00.000Z	mikebeecham	coz_	will give that a go...I'd love to get daap working, but I think itunes still blocks outgoing daap
2010-08-14T17:56:00.000Z	coz_	mikebeecham	  here is another link    http://benste.blogspot.com/2009/12/upnpdlna-vs-daap-itunes-share-in.html
2010-08-14T17:57:00.000Z	coz_	mikebeecham	` also in google  ...the search string  to use would be   rhythmbox daap itunes
