2006-01-01T16:55:00.000Z	FHX		Hey all
2006-01-01T16:56:00.000Z	FHX		I need some help..I tried in the kubuntu forums but they referred me here, no one there could help
2006-01-01T16:57:00.000Z	FHX		I'm trying to replace my entire system with only Kubuntu, but what has happened is that it had errors several times and so when I retried it for the fourth time during the Partitions step it only offers me the option to : Manually edit partition tables
2006-01-01T16:57:00.000Z	FHX		Could somebody help me out?
2006-01-01T16:57:00.000Z	FHX		..
2006-01-01T16:58:00.000Z	Stormx2	FHX	I suppose so.
2006-01-01T16:58:00.000Z	FHX	Stormx2	Could you tell m ehow to fix it, please?
2006-01-01T16:58:00.000Z	Stormx2	FHX	What errors did you get when you last tired to install kubuntu?
2006-01-01T16:58:00.000Z	Stormx2	FHX	Don't be, theres no rush
2006-01-01T16:58:00.000Z	Stormx2	FHX	Its fine.
2006-01-01T16:59:00.000Z	Stormx2	FHX	Let me get this straight, you want one kubuntu partition on this HDD, right?
2006-01-01T17:00:00.000Z	Stormx2	FHX	no partitions? OK. Select "Automaticly partition free space"
2006-01-01T17:00:00.000Z	FHX	Stormx2	Where's that?
2006-01-01T17:01:00.000Z	Stormx2	FHX	Ack. >.<
2006-01-01T17:01:00.000Z	Stormx2	FHX	Theres no way to go back up?
2006-01-01T17:01:00.000Z	Stormx2	FHX	If there are no partitions theres no data usable on the disk anyway
2006-01-01T17:33:00.000Z	Stormx2	FHX	Manually edit then
2006-01-01T17:33:00.000Z	Stormx2	FHX	Make a large ext3 partition mounted on / and a much smaller swap partition mounted on /swap
