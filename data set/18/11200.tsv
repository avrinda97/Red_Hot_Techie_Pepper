2006-09-02T14:48:00.000Z	nownott	fyrestrtr	well i upped my reslution on my laptop from 1024x768 to 1280x1024 now my pics and vids look bad
2006-09-02T14:48:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	nownott	define 'look bad' -- they are distorted?
2006-09-02T14:49:00.000Z	nownott	fyrestrtr	well grainy and it looks like bad shading like the light colors light and the dark colors dark
2006-09-02T14:50:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	nownott	what is the native resolution of your laptop? what kind of video card do you have?
2006-09-02T14:51:00.000Z	nownott	fyrestrtr	i believe nvidia geforce 2(old laptop card) and dont know the native resulution
2006-09-02T14:53:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	nownott	how big is the laptop screen?
2006-09-02T14:53:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	nownott	(you can find out what hardware you have, by running any one of the following commands: lspci -v or lshw)
2006-09-02T14:56:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	nownott	okay, what driver are you using?
2006-09-02T14:57:00.000Z	nownott	fyrestrtr	i used the easy ubuntu thing to install nvidia drivers
2006-09-02T14:57:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	nownott	okay, now how big is your laptop screen? Do you know if its supports anything higher than 1024x768
2006-09-02T14:58:00.000Z	nownott	fyrestrtr	that i don not know, is there a way to find this out
2006-09-02T14:58:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	nownott	well from what you have told me, I'd say it supports 1024x768 max :)
2006-09-02T14:59:00.000Z	nownott	fyrestrtr	but i win i can run 1280x1024 and it looks fine
2006-09-02T15:06:00.000Z	nownott	fyrestrtr	is there a way to have different resolution on different workspaces
2006-09-02T15:06:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	nownott	no.
2006-09-02T15:07:00.000Z	nownott	fyrestrtr	1024x768 works perfect 1280x1024 gives me problems but both work in windows
2006-09-02T15:07:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	nownott	hrmm ... I don't know what to tell you, could just be incomplete driver support for your chipset, or that your monitor isn't configured correctly.
