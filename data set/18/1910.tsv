2011-10-19T19:14:00.000Z	country0129		I'd done that, too, Scarleo
2011-10-19T19:14:00.000Z	country0129		Didn't work.
2011-10-19T19:14:00.000Z	country0129		Neither in synoptic or terminal.
2011-10-19T19:14:00.000Z	scarleo	country0129	You did a reboot after? And checked that your driver is activated?
2011-10-19T19:15:00.000Z	scarleo	country0129	what is your broadcom model?
2011-10-19T19:21:00.000Z	scarleo	country0129	what is your model?
2011-10-19T19:23:00.000Z	scarleo	country0129	and you have b43-fwcutter firmware-b43-installer installed?
2011-10-19T19:24:00.000Z	scarleo	country0129	did you do: sudo modprobe -r b43 ssb the sudo modprobe -a b43 ?
2011-10-19T19:26:00.000Z	scarleo	country0129	just to clatify: sudo modprobe -r b43 ssb; sudo modprobe -a b43
2011-10-19T19:26:00.000Z	scarleo	country0129	then wait, then wait some more
2011-10-19T19:26:00.000Z	scarleo	country0129	no it's not
2011-10-19T19:28:00.000Z	scarleo	country0129	what does your Additional Drivers say?
2011-10-19T19:31:00.000Z	country0129	scarleo	 It had the BROADCOM STA driver, it wasn't activated, I activated it, did all that other stuff we've been discussing...still no joy.
2011-10-19T19:32:00.000Z	scarleo	country0129	are you using firmware-b43-installer, or firmware-b43legacy-installer? Check in synaptic what is installed
2011-10-19T19:35:00.000Z	scarleo	country0129	Ok, mark b43-fwcutter firmware-b43-installer for reinstallation and Apply
2011-10-19T19:38:00.000Z	scarleo	country0129	;)
2011-10-19T19:40:00.000Z	scarleo	country0129	ok
