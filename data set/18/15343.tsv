2005-04-08T12:34:00.000Z	grogoreo	nydust	if your not going to use xfree86 i would remove all traces of it, just so its cleans up your directories if you have any other problems in the future
2005-04-08T12:34:00.000Z	nydust	grogoreo	do i need xfree86?

2005-04-08T12:35:00.000Z	grogoreo	nydust	well I found it alltogether more, as I firstly had problems with the login screen as it was a different resolution to my normal desktop. now its the same.

2005-04-08T12:36:00.000Z	grogoreo	nydust	and basically anything else called xfree86 (but dont go in a frenzy deleting everything!)
