2007-01-16T09:48:00.000Z	jontec		anyone know about mod_proxy? there's no package for it in the repo...
2007-01-16T09:48:00.000Z	unop	jontec	it's included by default on apache2 -- you just need to enable it (IIRC) .. use a2enmod
2007-01-16T09:52:00.000Z	jontec	unop	gracias. :D
2007-01-16T09:53:00.000Z	unop	jontec	did a2enmod work?
2007-01-16T09:53:00.000Z	jontec	unop	yup, I think.
2007-01-16T09:53:00.000Z	unop	jontec	cool :)
2007-02-10T09:44:00.000Z	unop	jontec	 he wants to have full access over /var/www/ remotely
2007-02-10T09:44:00.000Z	jontec	unop	okay, then if he can't do it remotely, then he can't do it locally either (I know you guys know this)
2007-02-10T09:54:00.000Z	unop	jontec	 ahh, no, this is from nautilus-connect-server .. not really X over ssh
2007-02-10T09:55:00.000Z	jontec	unop	what the heck is that? O_o I think I'm going back to kubuntu
2007-02-10T09:55:00.000Z	unop	jontec	 ahh, i forgot you're a KDE user -- it's errm, a utility that mounts remote shares locally
2007-02-10T09:56:00.000Z	unop	jontec	 so basically, it's a sftp client (i think)
2007-02-10T09:56:00.000Z	jontec	unop	ahh... gotcha
2007-02-10T09:56:00.000Z	jontec	unop	so he can't sudo at all into the other system...
2007-02-10T09:57:00.000Z	jontec	unop	that makes sense... I have to copy the stuff with sftp and the sudo ssh move them
2007-02-10T09:57:00.000Z	unop	jontec	 errm, not with this utility nope.. it's purely for filesystem access
2007-02-10T09:57:00.000Z	unop	jontec	 well, thats exactly what we're trying to avoid -- get the user he uses to log in remotely a member of the group that owns the directory
2007-02-10T09:58:00.000Z	jontec	unop	gotcha...
