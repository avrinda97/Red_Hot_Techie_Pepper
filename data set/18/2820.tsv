2010-02-14T00:44:00.000Z	guntbert	muad1	won't work, you can setup ssh keys though and look at ssh-add then
2010-02-14T00:46:00.000Z	muad1	guntbert	have tryed that the server dosent allow it off some reason i dont know
2010-02-14T00:47:00.000Z	guntbert	muad1	what did you try?
2010-02-14T00:48:00.000Z	muad1	guntbert	i copyed the key from the client too the server and symlinked two files :/
2010-02-14T00:49:00.000Z	guntbert	muad1	what key - to where? and what about that symlinking?
2010-02-14T00:50:00.000Z	muad1	guntbert	the public rsa key
2010-02-14T00:51:00.000Z	guntbert	muad1	to what file did you copy it?
2010-02-14T00:52:00.000Z	muad1	guntbert	authorized_keys and ln -s keys2 on the server
2010-02-14T00:53:00.000Z	muad1	guntbert	what i realy need is an way too connect ssh without know from where and new clients
2010-02-14T00:54:00.000Z	guntbert	muad1	ah - I never needed that ...keys2 thing
2010-02-14T00:55:00.000Z	muad1	guntbert	its an freebsd openSSH
2010-02-14T00:55:00.000Z	guntbert	muad1	then you need to stay with passwords - but ssh won't accept one from command line (as that could be easily spotted by any other user on the system)
2010-02-14T00:56:00.000Z	muad1	guntbert	i have figured out that mutch... :) i know there is an way too make ssh accept from echo stty
2010-02-14T00:57:00.000Z	muad1	guntbert	stty echo sorry
2010-02-14T00:58:00.000Z	guntbert	muad1	this I don't know - and I still cannot understand the purpose
2010-02-14T00:59:00.000Z	muad1	guntbert	too make an ssh auto connect too an server you need too create keys and that keys are needed on both the server and the client... and when you not know the client and where he connects from that will make an impossibel task
2010-02-14T01:00:00.000Z	guntbert	muad1	yes, that should be impossible - I hope
2010-02-14T01:01:00.000Z	muad1	guntbert	and therefor too make the keys i need too generate the keys an put them onto the server and that I realy dont wanna do over an unsecure ftp connection
