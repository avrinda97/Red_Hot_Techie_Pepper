2005-11-18T07:39:00.000Z	Seveas	xaint	what is the problem?
2005-11-18T07:41:00.000Z	xaint	Seveas	i have problem. I am trying to do normal things f.e. synaptic or apt-get or sudo, it accepted my password, but does nothing. Simply put me back to commandline and thats all.
2005-11-18T07:41:00.000Z	Seveas	xaint	wget http://www.ubuntulinux.nl/files/pastebin
2005-11-18T07:42:00.000Z	Seveas	xaint	sudo cat /etc/sudoers | python pastebin
2005-11-18T07:42:00.000Z	Seveas	xaint	id | python pastebin
2005-11-18T07:45:00.000Z	Seveas	xaint	try the first pastebin command again
2005-11-18T07:47:00.000Z	Seveas	xaint	hmm, I think my script is buggy, since it does not show at the pastebin
2005-11-18T07:49:00.000Z	Seveas	xaint	'sudo gedit /etc/sudoers' and put it on http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl manually
2005-11-18T07:50:00.000Z	Seveas	xaint	ah crud --- of course
2005-11-18T07:50:00.000Z	Seveas	xaint	did you set a root password perhaps?
2005-11-18T07:51:00.000Z	Seveas	xaint	if you have a root password, then do 'su' to become root and copy the file to /tmp
2005-11-18T07:53:00.000Z	Seveas	xaint	sure
2005-11-18T07:57:00.000Z	Seveas	xaint	hmm, your sudoers file is incomplete
2005-11-18T07:58:00.000Z	Seveas	xaint	as root, do: 'EDITOR=nano visudo'
2005-11-18T07:58:00.000Z	Seveas	xaint	ALL=(ALL) ALL
2005-11-18T07:58:00.000Z	Seveas	xaint	then save the file (ctrl o) and exit (ctrl x)
2005-11-18T08:00:00.000Z	Seveas	xaint	no you need a line that says 'xaint ALL=(ALL) ALL'
2005-11-18T08:04:00.000Z	Seveas	xaint	cool :)
