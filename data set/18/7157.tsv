2008-01-30T23:38:00.000Z	DRebellion	cbeaver	wireshark will "sniff" every packet off the wire and display it in as much technical detail as you want, great for someone like you who obviously understands tcp syn/ack etc.
2008-01-30T23:40:00.000Z	cbeaver		I really need this to work and fast, as I'm close to selling the idea of scrapping ~150 windows workstations, and replace them with Ubuntu 7.10 :)
