2006-06-05T07:29:00.000Z	troy_s		owner:  2nd check it... cd/dvd should be first in boot order.
2006-06-05T07:30:00.000Z	Owner	troy_s	i changed the order, it's the cd drive, then the floppy, then the network, and finally the hard drive
2006-06-05T07:30:00.000Z	troy_s	linxeh	 complicated!  right click burn.
2006-06-05T07:30:00.000Z	troy_s	linxeh	 :)
2006-06-05T07:30:00.000Z	troy_s	linxeh	 try a dvd then
2006-06-05T07:33:00.000Z	troy_s	linxeh	 then remove files from the iso
2006-06-05T07:33:00.000Z	troy_s	linxeh	 your options are pretty limited :)
2006-06-05T07:33:00.000Z	Owner	troy_s	any idea what might cause it?
2006-06-05T07:33:00.000Z	troy_s		lukas:  you need -dev and if you have it, you might not have the correct version or you might need to tell the make where it is at.
2006-06-05T07:34:00.000Z	troy_s		owner:  upgrade the bios?
2006-06-05T07:34:00.000Z	Owner	troy_s	how would i do that?
2006-06-05T07:34:00.000Z	troy_s		owner:  you are 100% certain that the boot is set to cd for first?
2006-06-05T07:34:00.000Z	troy_s		owner:  then reboot from scratch with the disk in before post
2006-06-05T07:34:00.000Z	troy_s		owner:  if that fails, you might have a firmware bios issue... you will need to locate the make / model and find the motherboard, then track down the bios firmware
2006-06-05T07:35:00.000Z	troy_s		yay Ron_o
2006-06-05T07:35:00.000Z	troy_s		ron_o: congrats... hopefully that will help you out.
