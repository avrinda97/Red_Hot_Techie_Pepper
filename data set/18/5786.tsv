2009-10-30T14:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Tesssa	did you install from a CD?
2009-10-30T14:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Tesssa	did you mD5 test the ISO you downloaded? Did you run the CD verifier?
2009-10-30T14:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Tesssa	sure you do, you downloaded a massive block of data of a packet switched network
2009-10-30T14:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Tesssa	MD5 doesnt check its an official image, it makes sure it hasnt become garbaged in transit
2009-10-30T14:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Tesssa	maybe you got lucky, its good to test
2009-10-30T14:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Tesssa	there is also a checker on the CD to test the burned cD is error free too
2009-10-30T15:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Tesssa	you don't. you read the links in the output
2009-11-02T15:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Tesssa	does it happen for all user names?
2009-11-02T15:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Tesssa	boot to recvery root console, make a new user and try logging on as that
2009-11-02T15:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Tesssa	this will test if its just your user, or the system at large
2009-11-02T15:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Tesssa	lots of stuff should work
2009-11-02T15:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Tesssa	none, its faster as you dont have to boot an X server
2009-11-02T15:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Tesssa	boot to liveCD or install to a USB / SD card, you can try it without changing your internal drives
2009-11-02T18:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Tesssa	I like LXDE
2009-12-22T17:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Tesssa	sudo-apt-get ubuntu-desktop
2009-12-22T17:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Tesssa	no package name has a space
2009-12-22T17:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	Tesssa	sudo apt-get --reinstall install ubuntu-desktop
