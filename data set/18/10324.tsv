2006-12-18T15:23:00.000Z	curs0r	Kerpal	make sure your nic is supported by that first
2006-12-18T15:23:00.000Z	curs0r	Kerpal	can you boot from usb?
2006-12-18T15:24:00.000Z	curs0r	Kerpal	does your nic have a boot rom?
2006-12-18T15:24:00.000Z	curs0r	Kerpal	that's most likely a resounding no
2006-12-18T15:25:00.000Z	curs0r	Kerpal	your options would be: get a new cdrom, or a usb device assuming you can boot from one
2006-12-18T15:25:00.000Z	curs0r	Kerpal	verify the ubuntu disc after you burn it
2006-12-18T15:26:00.000Z	curs0r	Kerpal	then you have a different problem
2006-12-18T15:27:00.000Z	curs0r	Kerpal	it is if you have a boot rom which that laptop probably doesn't
2006-12-18T15:28:00.000Z	curs0r	Kerpal	a usb device and zipslack or a new cd drive
2006-12-18T15:29:00.000Z	curs0r	Kerpal	yes
2006-12-18T15:30:00.000Z	curs0r	Kerpal	bear in mind i don't think you can boot ubuntu in it's released form that way
2006-12-18T15:30:00.000Z	curs0r	Kerpal	this is why i mention zipslack, which is designed for that
2006-12-18T15:30:00.000Z	curs0r	Kerpal	google ftw
2006-12-18T15:32:00.000Z	curs0r	Kerpal	the general idea is that you use zipslack to access the ubuntu installer. start zipslack, use ntfs-3g to mount your hard drive, download the ubuntu iso, mount it, then run the installer
2006-12-18T15:33:00.000Z	curs0r	Kerpal	crap that won't work unless you have a big flash drive
2006-12-18T15:34:00.000Z	curs0r	Kerpal	my small flash drive is 2gb lol
2006-12-18T15:34:00.000Z	curs0r	Kerpal	every once in a while it's real handy
