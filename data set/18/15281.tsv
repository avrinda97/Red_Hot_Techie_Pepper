2005-04-17T07:46:00.000Z	whiskey_2	tritium	yes the gconf worked great...now i have it back on the desktop and the panel which is ok with me
2005-04-17T07:46:00.000Z	tritium	whiskey_2	good deal :
2005-04-17T07:54:00.000Z	tritium	whiskey_2	there's sudo
2005-04-17T07:54:00.000Z	whiskey_2	tritium	yes i guess that would work...i am not really sure of sudo's limitations...i never used it that much
2005-04-17T07:54:00.000Z	tritium	whiskey_2	http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/RootSudo
2005-04-17T07:55:00.000Z	whiskey_2	tritium	i only used sudo to run programs as root...i never tried building directories and moving files with it
2005-04-17T07:55:00.000Z	tritium	whiskey_2	you may like to use "sudo -s -H"
2005-04-17T07:55:00.000Z	whiskey_2	tritium	ok...thank you very much for the advice
2005-04-17T07:55:00.000Z	tritium	whiskey_2	:)
