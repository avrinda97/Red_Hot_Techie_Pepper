2005-12-21T11:24:00.000Z	yubimusubi		Now if I can convince my dad to move from Quickbooks to, for instance, GNUCash, so he can completely ditch win$uck
2005-12-21T11:24:00.000Z	frogzoo	yubimusubi	try qemu mebbe...
2005-12-21T11:25:00.000Z	yubimusubi	frogzoo	qemu? is that like QB?
2005-12-21T11:25:00.000Z	frogzoo	yubimusubi	it's a GPL emulator - same thing as vmware but free
2005-12-21T11:25:00.000Z	yubimusubi	frogzoo	Well why don't I just use wine? or cxoffice?
2005-12-21T11:26:00.000Z	frogzoo	yubimusubi	wine compatabilities not perfect - otherwise, I'd run wine too
2005-12-21T11:27:00.000Z	yubimusubi	frogzoo	Heh, tell me about it...wine/cedega can't handle most of the decent games for win
2005-12-21T11:27:00.000Z	frogzoo	yubimusubi	but for serious gaming, you really need native - no way out if you need performance so dual boot is the way to go
2005-12-21T11:28:00.000Z	yubimusubi	frogzoo	Yea, I wish that was true
2005-12-21T11:29:00.000Z	frogzoo	yubimusubi	b4 upgrading to breezy - be absolutely sure to install both 'ubuntu-base' and 'ubuntu-desktop'
2005-12-21T11:29:00.000Z	yubimusubi	frogzoo	what are those?
2005-12-21T11:29:00.000Z	frogzoo	yubimusubi	read the upgrade guide in wiki
2005-12-21T12:02:00.000Z	yubimusubi	frogzoo	try synaptic?
2005-12-21T12:02:00.000Z	yubimusubi	frogzoo	oh, nvm
2005-12-21T15:16:00.000Z	yubimusubi	frogzoo	messy?
2005-12-21T15:17:00.000Z	yubimusubi	frogzoo	is make menuconfig really that difficult in ubuntu?
2005-12-21T15:17:00.000Z	frogzoo	yubimusubi	depends on who's doing it - I prefer to not advise newbs to reinstall their kernel
2005-12-21T15:17:00.000Z	yubimusubi	frogzoo	ohh, okay...
