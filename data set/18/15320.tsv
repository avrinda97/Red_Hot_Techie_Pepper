2005-06-28T16:45:00.000Z	hksdu		Does anybody know any Eclipse IDE channel on freenode?
2005-06-28T16:46:00.000Z	Seveas	hksdu	#eclipse :)
2005-06-28T16:47:00.000Z	Seveas	hksdu	you should install openssh-server on the machine, it's not installed by default
2005-06-28T16:47:00.000Z	hksdu	Seveas	I did, I ssh from my remote machine and no problem at all
2005-06-28T16:48:00.000Z	Seveas	hksdu	what's the IP of your home machine, i'll try to connect to it
2005-06-28T16:48:00.000Z	hksdu	Seveas	24.114.119.181
2005-06-28T16:49:00.000Z	Seveas	hksdu	works
2005-06-28T16:49:00.000Z	hksdu	Seveas	it's alright, nothing important there, it's just a learning machine for me
2005-06-28T16:49:00.000Z	hksdu	Seveas	so it means that my office blocks everything right?
2005-06-28T16:50:00.000Z	hksdu	Seveas	I checked out the doc on openssh, it says that I can use port forward to create tunneling, so I created a tunnel on ssh itself, but it didn't work.
2005-06-28T16:50:00.000Z	Seveas	hksdu	try ssh -p 30 seveas.demon.nl
2005-06-28T16:51:00.000Z	hksdu	Seveas	hm...so even tunneling cannot break thru?
2005-06-28T16:51:00.000Z	hksdu	Seveas	:P...haha...alright, thanks a lot...I will try it out tomorrow...
2005-06-28T16:52:00.000Z	Seveas	hksdu	the machine isn't always online there, it's my laptop :)
2005-06-28T16:52:00.000Z	Seveas	hksdu	#eclipse
2005-06-28T16:53:00.000Z	hksdu	Seveas	on freenode.net?
2005-06-28T16:53:00.000Z	Seveas	hksdu	yes
2005-06-28T16:53:00.000Z	hksdu	Seveas	thanks
