2008-12-19T20:45:00.000Z	Psi-Jack		And it's blank beyond that
2008-12-19T20:45:00.000Z	Psi-Jack		My /etc/resolv.conf
2008-12-19T20:45:00.000Z	Psi-Jack		Kinda useless that..
2008-12-19T20:45:00.000Z	Psi-Jack		Especially when I run my own DNS server.
2008-12-19T20:45:00.000Z	adam7	Psi-Jack	if you don't change networks and you use ext3 you can chattr +i /etc/resolv.conf
2008-12-19T20:46:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	adam7	That's a band-aid for a problem that Ubuntu's startup routine is doing.
2008-12-19T20:46:00.000Z	adam7	Psi-Jack	yes, it is. Just a suggestion.
2008-12-19T20:46:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	adam7	If this were a laptop, that would be a very bad idea. ;)
2008-12-19T20:47:00.000Z	adam7	Psi-Jack	as I said, if you don't switch networks ;)
2008-12-19T20:47:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	adam7	Do you know a proper means to fix it though?
2008-12-19T20:47:00.000Z	adam7	Psi-Jack	nope. you can hunt around in /etc/dhcp/dhclient.conf ( I  think) and find a prepend-nameservers option, and try that.
2008-12-19T20:48:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	adam7	I don't use dhclient.
2008-12-19T20:48:00.000Z	adam7	Psi-Jack	What do you use?
2008-12-19T20:48:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	adam7	I'm static on m LAN.
2008-12-19T20:48:00.000Z	adam7	Psi-Jack	hm. (Dumb question ->) did you specify the DNS servers in NM?
2008-12-19T20:49:00.000Z	Psi-Jack	adam7	hischild: I manually did use the GUI tools, but it FAILED
