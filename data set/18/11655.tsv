2012-03-29T17:56:00.000Z	amigamia		morning
2012-03-29T17:56:00.000Z	amigamia		i installed lamp and lastnight i was able to ssh into the server but this morning after restarting the server it wont let me ssh into it it is refusing me any reason why?
2012-03-29T17:58:00.000Z	amigamia		it's next to me but let me check everything you just said. as far as daemon running anyway. brb thanks
2012-03-29T17:58:00.000Z	fidel	amigamia	can you access that service pysically?
2012-03-29T18:00:00.000Z	amigamia	fidel	yes it is next to me on a server
2012-08-26T22:37:00.000Z	fidel	amigamia	are you used to ssh & sudo?
2012-08-26T22:37:00.000Z	fidel	amigamia	ssh from client to other client as normal user & then use sudo on the target pc to do jobs which might need administrative permissions
2012-08-26T22:43:00.000Z	fidel	amigamia	get used to the secure solutions you have - using the insecure methods is not a clever way to go
2012-08-26T22:45:00.000Z	fidel	amigamia	winscp for windows
2012-08-26T22:45:00.000Z	fidel	amigamia	no but fully mention what you are asking for ;)
2012-08-26T22:45:00.000Z	amigamia	fidel	haha
2012-08-26T22:46:00.000Z	amigamia	fidel	if this requires net i am screwed....
2012-08-26T22:46:00.000Z	fidel	amigamia	my personal tip is: get used to cli - it might look uncomfortable at beginning - but makes you pretty independable later on
2012-08-26T22:47:00.000Z	fidel	amigamia	requires net?
2012-08-26T22:57:00.000Z	fidel	amigamia	as mentioned above - get used to ssh and using sudo
2012-08-26T22:58:00.000Z	fidel	amigamia	then ssh in and use something like mc at the target if you think only guis rock. is that an option?
2012-08-26T22:59:00.000Z	amigamia	fidel	i just wanted to have the ease of use is all.
2012-08-26T22:59:00.000Z	fidel	amigamia	well i am out then ;) good luck
