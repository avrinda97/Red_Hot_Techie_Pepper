2008-12-14T12:41:00.000Z	tritium	eweb100	no, gnome-display-properties is in the gnome-control-center package, which xubuntu does not appear to depend upon
2008-12-14T12:41:00.000Z	eweb100	tritium	Then what is the Alternitive?
2008-12-14T12:42:00.000Z	tritium	eweb100	I suggest you ask in #xubuntu.  Alternatively, you could install that package.
2008-12-14T12:42:00.000Z	eweb100	tritium	Thank you i didn't know there was a chanel devoted to it THANKS!
