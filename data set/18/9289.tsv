2007-04-21T07:37:00.000Z	Bundaluk		Does anyone know a room where there are people that can help with Feisty upgrade help using Update Manager?
2007-04-21T07:37:00.000Z	xtknight	Bundaluk	right here
2007-04-21T07:38:00.000Z	Bundaluk	xtknight	I used update manager to upgrade to Feisty but internet connection dropped half way through. Now Update Manager doesn't recognise that the Feisty update is available. So I can't resume and cant find any fix on the wiki. Any help?
2007-04-21T07:41:00.000Z	xtknight	Bundaluk	youd be better off being a lot more specific
2007-04-21T07:41:00.000Z	xtknight	Bundaluk	what troubles exactly are you having with your upgrade?
2007-04-21T07:42:00.000Z	Bundaluk	xtknight	I used update manager to upgrade to feisty...
2007-04-21T07:46:00.000Z	xtknight	Bundaluk	sorry.  you'll have to highlight your messages with my name in front or i'll miss them easily
2007-04-21T07:46:00.000Z	xtknight	Bundaluk	what happened after your network dropped?
2007-04-21T07:46:00.000Z	xtknight	Bundaluk	are you on edgy now?  feisty?  frankenstein?
2007-04-21T07:47:00.000Z	Bundaluk	xtknight	when the line dropped out it very cleverly and automatically reverted all files back to edgy
2007-04-21T07:47:00.000Z	xtknight	Bundaluk	ok what happens if you run update-manager again?
2007-04-21T07:48:00.000Z	Bundaluk	xtknight	it doesn't give the "upgrade to feisty" button up the top. No matter how often I refresh.
2007-04-21T07:49:00.000Z	xtknight	Bundaluk	interesting.  dont you have to throw parameters to update-manager, though  like -c or -d?
2007-04-21T07:50:00.000Z	Bundaluk	xtknight	I'll give ait a quick try
2007-04-21T07:51:00.000Z	xtknight	Bundaluk	like "gksu update-manager -c -d"
2007-04-21T07:51:00.000Z	xtknight	Bundaluk	just "gksu update-manager -c" actually but -d wouldnt have done anything
2007-04-21T07:52:00.000Z	Bundaluk	xtknight	I'll try it out in a minute and let you know how I go..
2007-04-21T07:52:00.000Z	xtknight	Bundaluk	okay
