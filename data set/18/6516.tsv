2010-03-31T17:08:00.000Z	judgepg	Arti	are you sure you don't have write tab switched on the USB key?
2010-03-31T17:09:00.000Z	Arti	judgepg	i dont have eny tabs
2010-03-31T17:10:00.000Z	judgepg	Arti	no switches on the usb key that enable read/write protection?  Otherwise, just as the other gentlemen said, perhaps it's mounted to read-only
2010-03-31T17:16:00.000Z	judgepg	Arti	just format it using gparted, and select ext3 filesystem (if you plan to use only under linux), or (NTFS/FAT if planning to use in windows as well).  Don't worry about the 'virus' on the usb key.  You're not using windows at the moment.
2010-03-31T17:22:00.000Z	judgepg	Arti	is the FS mounted?
2010-03-31T17:22:00.000Z	Arti	judgepg	yes it is mounted
2010-03-31T17:23:00.000Z	judgepg	Arti	umount it first, then try one of the utilities to remove the partition
2010-03-31T17:29:00.000Z	judgepg	Arti	try removing the USB key, confirm there are no read/write tabs on the key, plug it back in, and run a dmesg to check the output
2010-03-31T17:31:00.000Z	judgepg	Arti	once you plug it back in, if hal mounts the usb device, umount it and try using gparted again
2010-03-31T17:32:00.000Z	Arti	judgepg	http://paste.ubuntu.com/407027/ this is report
2010-03-31T17:33:00.000Z	Arti	judgepg	this is all report of dmesg - http://paste.ubuntu.com/407028/
2010-03-31T17:35:00.000Z	judgepg	Arti	taking a look now
2010-03-31T17:37:00.000Z	judgepg	Arti	Arti I'm seeing an entry for write protect being on.  Again, no h/w switches on the USB
2010-03-31T17:38:00.000Z	judgepg	Arti	try umounting, then mmount -o,remount /media/usbkey
2010-03-31T17:40:00.000Z	judgepg	Arti	I'm running out of ideas, but it may be that the media might be bad.  Need to head out.  Try the USB on another machine
