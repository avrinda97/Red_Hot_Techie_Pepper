2009-11-29T02:24:00.000Z	aurolac		*preach
2009-11-29T02:25:00.000Z	aurolac		all you've done is waste time and space
2009-11-29T02:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aurolac	i wont until you give details
2009-11-29T02:24:00.000Z	aurolac	ActionParsnip	don't preace to me, it was a useful question because it relates to that laptop
2009-11-29T02:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aurolac	its a moot question, just ask as if someone said "yes" and find out
2009-11-29T02:25:00.000Z	aurolac	ActionParsnip	if someone says yes then great, what's the point of elaborating on an issue if nobody else owns one
2009-11-29T02:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aurolac	its not preaching in any way, its just showing your initial question is pointless
2009-11-29T02:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aurolac	because it takes an initial question then another, why not cut out the first one and ask your real questio worded slightly differently
2009-11-29T02:26:00.000Z	aurolac	ActionParsnip	i'll deal with that when the time comes
2009-11-29T02:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aurolac	you'll be waiting a LONG time
2009-11-29T02:27:00.000Z	aurolac	ActionParsnip	don't you worry about me
2009-11-29T02:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aurolac	as you have given no information
2009-11-29T02:28:00.000Z	aurolac	ActionParsnip	go suck a lemon

2009-11-29T02:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aurolac	no it shows you need to listen to the bot
2009-11-29T02:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aurolac	i asked you to expand on your issue, you failed to do so, so nobody can help you
