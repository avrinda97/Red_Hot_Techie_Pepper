2005-02-09T07:57:00.000Z	shingoki		Anyone know about totem? its just I assume that at some point it has worked for someone, but I've never actually seen it play a file - it always says the plugin isn't available or something
2005-02-09T07:58:00.000Z	Lathiat	shingoki	for most media files at the moment you need to install totem-xine unfortunately
2005-02-09T07:58:00.000Z	Lathiat	shingoki	that does however move your install into the unsupported configuration
2005-02-09T07:58:00.000Z	shingoki	Lathiat	ah, well thatsok, I was just using xine before anyway
2005-02-09T07:59:00.000Z	Lathiat	shingoki	you can install mplayer
2005-02-09T07:59:00.000Z	Lathiat	shingoki	from debian-marillaat
2005-02-09T07:59:00.000Z	Lathiat	shingoki	totem-xine plays everything mplayer does for me
2005-02-09T08:00:00.000Z	shingoki	Lathiat	ah well thats good... then they should support xine. Cos totem on its own really doesn't seem to play anything at all, even plain mpeg1...which makes me wonder what it DOES play ;)
2005-02-09T08:00:00.000Z	Lathiat	shingoki	should play basic non copyrighted codecs in theory :P
2005-02-09T08:00:00.000Z	Lathiat	shingoki	support for the gstreamer stuff is being worked on, it needs alot of work at the moment
2005-02-09T08:01:00.000Z	Lathiat	shingoki	yeh it doesnt really do that much
2005-02-09T08:01:00.000Z	shingoki	Lathiat	Really? it soudns bad...
2005-02-09T08:01:00.000Z	Lathiat	shingoki	bu it means officially your system is "unsupported"
2005-02-09T08:01:00.000Z	Lathiat	shingoki	ubuntu-desktop is just a meta-package which depends on the base install configuration
2005-02-09T08:01:00.000Z	Lathiat	shingoki	and is removed if you stray from it
2005-02-09T08:02:00.000Z	Lathiat	shingoki	only real problem that causes is in future upgrades sometimes they add packages to it
2005-02-09T08:02:00.000Z	Lathiat	shingoki	to force them to install in an upgrade
2005-02-09T08:02:00.000Z	Lathiat	shingoki	so every so often i apt-get install ubuntu-desktop and see what deps its trying to bring in and install those manually
