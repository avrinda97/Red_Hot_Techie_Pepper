2005-08-06T05:33:00.000Z	Amaranth	erisco	http://216.8.167.140 should also work
2005-08-06T05:34:00.000Z	Amaranth	erisco	That's the IP to your router.
2005-08-06T05:34:00.000Z	Amaranth	erisco	You're completely exposing yourself going to a website.
2005-08-06T05:35:00.000Z	Amaranth	erisco	The only port open on your machine is port 80 anyway.
2005-08-06T05:35:00.000Z	Amaranth	erisco	I don't understand the question.
2005-08-06T12:23:00.000Z	Amaranth	erisco	openssh-server
2005-08-06T12:28:00.000Z	Amaranth	erisco	openssh-server
2005-08-06T12:29:00.000Z	Amaranth	erisco	That's a package to install.
