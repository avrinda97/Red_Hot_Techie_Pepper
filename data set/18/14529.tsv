2005-07-16T13:22:00.000Z	blrich		can anyone tell me - what's the package for the latest dev version of the ubuntu 2.6 kernel? so i can fold some drivers into it and compile them in
2005-07-16T13:23:00.000Z	bob2	blrich	it depends what you're trying to do, exactly
2005-07-16T13:24:00.000Z	blrich	bob2	trying to get madwifi drivers working to get my netgear wireless card working. have the drivers, but they're in code form - i have to put them into a 2.6 kernel tree and compile the kernel, i presume. so, i need the code for the latest ubuntu kernel
2005-07-16T13:24:00.000Z	bob2	blrich	you're sure the ubuntu madwifi drivers won't work?
2005-07-16T13:25:00.000Z	blrich	bob2	i can't get them, i type in apt-cache search madwifi and it comes up with the 'restricted modules' packages. i installed one, reset, etc, wifi card still won't work. don't know the name of the driver to modprobe even
2005-07-16T13:26:00.000Z	bob2	blrich	if you don't know the name of the module, how would compiling them help?
2005-07-16T13:26:00.000Z	blrich	bob2	but if they just give you the ach_pci et.c drivers, well then they're already getting autoloaded and not working anyway
2005-07-16T13:26:00.000Z	bob2	blrich	run 'sudo apt-get install linux-restricted-modules-$(uname -r)'
2005-07-16T13:26:00.000Z	blrich	bob2	well i presume i'll get some more information when i go in and configure the kernel
2005-07-16T13:26:00.000Z	bob2	blrich	no, I don't think you will.  what sort of card is it?
2005-07-16T13:27:00.000Z	blrich	bob2	linux-restricted-modules-2.6.10-5-686 is already the newest version.
2005-07-16T13:28:00.000Z	blrich	bob2	i have a netgear 802.11g pci card, according to the ubuntu wiki it should have the ar5212 chipset (it does) and bring up an interface called ach or ap0 or something, which it hasn't and won't
2005-07-16T13:28:00.000Z	blrich	bob2	someone suggested madwifi, i presume this is a different set of drivers. found a deb of them on the net, it unpacks to a tar.gz of the madwifi modules source in /usr/src/
2005-07-16T13:29:00.000Z	bob2	blrich	no, ignore the madwifi suggestion
2005-07-16T13:29:00.000Z	bob2	blrich	they're already included in ubuntu
2005-09-11T14:27:00.000Z	bob2	blrich	no
2005-09-11T14:27:00.000Z	blrich	bob2	will it ever? it has mkreiser4
2005-09-11T14:28:00.000Z	bob2	blrich	is reiser4 in the mainline kernel?
