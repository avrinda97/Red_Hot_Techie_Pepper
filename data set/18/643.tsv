2011-11-16T02:18:00.000Z	TheGeeko61		Can anyone help me create an entry on the launcher?  (Using 11.10)
2011-11-16T02:19:00.000Z	TheGeeko61		I've installed gnuzilla... and I can run it fine from the terminal.
2011-11-16T02:19:00.000Z	TheGeeko61		The instructions for adding items to the Launcher say to drag an icon from the dashboard...
2011-11-16T02:20:00.000Z	TheGeeko61		But, when I type "icecat" into the dashboard... no results are shown from which to choose an icon...
2011-11-16T02:22:00.000Z	TheGeeko61		Is there anyone who can help?  Please....
2011-11-16T02:22:00.000Z	TheGeeko61		#muhomor2, have you tried GIMP?
2011-11-16T02:22:00.000Z	Barbarian	TheGeeko61	 I had a guide on this open, lemme find it in the history
2011-11-16T02:25:00.000Z	Barbarian	TheGeeko61	Ok, in the terminal, go to where your file is that you wanna shortcut and do "sudo ln -s [file]"
2011-11-16T02:26:00.000Z	Barbarian	TheGeeko61	then copy that link file to /home/[username]/Desktop
2011-11-16T02:39:00.000Z	Barbarian	TheGeeko61	Ok, try right-clicking on desktop and create a launcher with the path to your file
2011-11-16T02:43:00.000Z	Barbarian	TheGeeko61	yeah, realised that after I tried it myself, was thinking of 11.04.
2011-11-16T02:45:00.000Z	Barbarian	TheGeeko61	"Fat32 doesn't support symbolic links. This means that you can't create a link _on_ the fat32 partition, but you should be able to make link to files that are on the partition. Right-click -> Make Link won't work, because it will try to create the link in the same directory as the original, on the fat32 partition.
2011-11-16T02:46:00.000Z	Barbarian	TheGeeko61	Oh crap, this is from 2005, old as hell. Nvm!
2011-11-16T02:51:00.000Z	Barbarian	TheGeeko61	I think I found a solution for you, just testing it myself first :P
2011-11-16T02:54:00.000Z	Barbarian	TheGeeko61	Well, I found something that 100% works. https://everythingexpress.wordpress.com/2011/11/12/how-to-create-a-desktop-shortcut-on-ubuntu-11-10/
2011-11-16T02:54:00.000Z	Barbarian	TheGeeko61	needed to install a package for it, but it works
2011-11-16T03:04:00.000Z	Barbarian	TheGeeko61	Yeah, starting to feel that way myself. After going to 12.04, I think I'm gonna stick with that for a long while
2011-11-16T03:05:00.000Z	Barbarian	TheGeeko61	I've heard good things about mint
