2007-10-28T23:36:00.000Z	mikegiar		hi guys, does anyone know how I could find my hard drive while running a live CD
2007-10-28T23:37:00.000Z	mikegiar		work with, and move the data to an ext drive
2007-10-28T23:38:00.000Z	mikegiar		yeah, it's not showing up
2007-10-28T23:38:00.000Z	jonasj	mikegiar	you are using the dapper live cd, right? if you downloaded a newer one, it should work automatically
2007-10-28T23:40:00.000Z	jonasj	mikegiar	how many hard disks are in your machine? just one?
2007-10-28T23:40:00.000Z	mikegiar	jonasj	yes, 1
2007-10-28T23:40:00.000Z	jonasj	mikegiar	ide or sata drive?
2007-10-28T23:41:00.000Z	mikegiar	jonasj	not sure it's in a Dell laptop
2007-10-28T23:41:00.000Z	jonasj	mikegiar	try typing  sudo mount /dev/hda and press tab. does it add a number?
2007-10-28T23:42:00.000Z	jonasj	mikegiar	i mean: type "sudo mount /dev/hda" and press tab two times. what options do you get?
2007-10-28T23:43:00.000Z	jonasj	mikegiar	what about "sudo mount /dev/sda" and tab two times
2007-10-28T23:43:00.000Z	jonasj	mikegiar	anything happen?
2007-10-28T23:44:00.000Z	mikegiar	jonasj	when i press tab the second time and / appears
2007-10-28T23:44:00.000Z	jonasj	mikegiar	what did you type?
2007-10-28T23:45:00.000Z	mikegiar	jonasj	when I typed "sudo mount /dev/sda" and pressed tab two times, nothing happened
2007-10-28T23:46:00.000Z	jonasj	mikegiar	neither with hda or sda it suggests something like hda1 or sda1? strange
2007-10-28T23:47:00.000Z	jonasj	mikegiar	that is strange. i think you should try downloading the latest version and trying with that live cd - it should detect your disk automatically
2007-10-28T23:47:00.000Z	mikegiar	jonasj	thanks I will try with the lastest live cd. downloading now
