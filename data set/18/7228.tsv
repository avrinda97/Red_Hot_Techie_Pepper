2008-01-24T22:15:00.000Z	DFlamingo		Well I'm a windows user, been wanting to use Lunix
2008-01-24T22:15:00.000Z	DFlamingo		*Linux
2008-01-24T22:15:00.000Z	DFlamingo		Problem is, I've never used it before
2008-01-24T22:15:00.000Z	DFlamingo		And I don't know how to go about installing it
2008-01-24T22:15:00.000Z	DFlamingo		._.
2008-01-24T22:16:00.000Z	DFlamingo		Yeah, about that
2008-01-24T22:16:00.000Z	DFlamingo		I'm REALLY new to this
2008-01-24T22:16:00.000Z	DFlamingo		How do I run Linux when I'm using Vista as my OS?
2008-01-24T22:17:00.000Z	DFlamingo		Hmm, I'd like to uninstall Windows.. it's too much of a resource hog..
2008-01-24T22:17:00.000Z	danand	DFlamingo	You can't run both at the same time but can dual-boot ie use one or the other
2008-01-24T22:19:00.000Z	danand	DFlamingo	Don't remove your windows partition until you have decided whether you like ubuntu using the live CD
2008-01-24T22:20:00.000Z	danand	DFlamingo	Yes
2008-01-24T22:26:00.000Z	danand	DFlamingo	Yes - you can use gparted - nice gui based tool to mess about with partitions and the like
2008-01-24T22:27:00.000Z	danand	DFlamingo	rhythbox - music, xine - video - lots bundled inside :)
2008-01-24T22:28:00.000Z	danand	DFlamingo	As the bot said - lots of choices
2008-01-24T22:28:00.000Z	danand	DFlamingo	Best way to do it!!
2008-01-24T22:29:00.000Z	danand	DFlamingo	No Problemo
