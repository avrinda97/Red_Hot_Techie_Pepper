2012-04-02T17:34:00.000Z	ikonia	speakman	it's well documented, have a look
2012-04-02T17:26:00.000Z	ikonia	speakman	shouldn't need to defrag it
2012-04-02T17:26:00.000Z	speakman	ikonia	why?
2012-04-02T17:26:00.000Z	ikonia	speakman	defragmentation is not a common task on ext file systems
2012-04-02T17:27:00.000Z	ikonia	speakman	why do you think your file system is fragmented ?
2012-04-02T17:27:00.000Z	speakman	ikonia	I know, but why isn't it needed?
2012-04-02T17:27:00.000Z	ikonia	speakman	because the ext file systems don't fragment easy
2012-04-02T17:27:00.000Z	speakman	ikonia	Ext4 is a simple, although secure, file system. It will be fragmented as any other file systems. Unless there's online defragmentation.
2012-04-02T17:27:00.000Z	speakman	ikonia	Why isn't it?
2012-04-02T17:28:00.000Z	ikonia	speakman	because of it's design, have a little research on it
2012-04-02T17:28:00.000Z	speakman	ikonia	That's not an argument
2012-04-02T17:28:00.000Z	ikonia	speakman	I'm not trying to argue
2012-04-02T17:29:00.000Z	ikonia	speakman	I'm just informing you that you shouldn't need to defragment unless you have reason to believe it's fragmented (which is why I asked why you thought it was fragmented)
2012-04-02T17:31:00.000Z	speakman	ikonia	I'm talking theories. Eventually it will become fragmented as any other filesystems.
2012-04-02T17:31:00.000Z	ikonia	speakman	not really. it's only rare situations it will
2012-04-02T17:32:00.000Z	ikonia	speakman	it's quite well documented
2012-04-02T17:32:00.000Z	ikonia	speakman	there is a "need" for the tools, but it's rare cases
2012-04-02T17:36:00.000Z	ikonia	speakman	read the ext documentation, there is also some solid information in kernel release notes
