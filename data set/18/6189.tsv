2008-06-12T06:29:00.000Z	rampageoberon	whatever01	the motd message is at /etc/motd
2008-06-12T06:47:00.000Z	rampageoberon	whatever01	you need to do this in /etc/ssh/sshd_config

2008-06-12T08:29:00.000Z	whatever01	rampageoberon	so how do i view the process from a terminal on the machine itself?
2008-06-12T08:29:00.000Z	rampageoberon	whatever01	use a screen session
2008-06-12T08:29:00.000Z	rampageoberon	whatever01	and run them there, as once in the background i don't know how to view them
2008-06-12T08:30:00.000Z	rampageoberon	whatever01	do "man screen" and "screen -h"
