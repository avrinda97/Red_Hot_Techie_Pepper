2007-05-31T12:21:00.000Z	tcblack		Hi all.  I just installed Ubuntu and when I login the desktop doesn't finish loading just kind of hangs before I even get the splash screen telling me that gnome is loading.
2007-05-31T12:22:00.000Z	ikonia	tcblack	ignore that advice
2007-05-31T12:23:00.000Z	tcblack	ikonia	any ideas?
2007-05-31T12:23:00.000Z	ikonia	tcblack	does this happen every time on reboot ?
2007-05-31T12:23:00.000Z	ikonia	tcblack	ok - so its intermittant
2007-05-31T12:23:00.000Z	tcblack	ikonia	well 15 reboots (feels like windows) and only one worked
2007-05-31T12:24:00.000Z	ikonia	tcblack	ok, thats a reasonable statment
2007-05-31T12:24:00.000Z	ikonia	tcblack	have you done the obvious things like ran a memcheck for a few hours
2007-05-31T12:24:00.000Z	tcblack	ikonia	yes,  the memory is good.  I think a gnome file is corrupt (load script etc?)
2007-05-31T12:25:00.000Z	ikonia	tcblack	can't be as it has worked - scripts don't corrupt then uncorrupt then corrupt again
2007-05-31T12:25:00.000Z	tcblack	ikonia	- then it almost requires a memory (or hard disk) issue?
2007-05-31T12:25:00.000Z	ikonia	tcblack	did you say you had run memcheck for a few hours ?
2007-05-31T12:26:00.000Z	tcblack	ikonia	under an hour;  perhaps not long enough?
2007-05-31T12:26:00.000Z	ikonia	tcblack	thats not even 1 pass
2007-05-31T12:27:00.000Z	tcblack	ikonia	i'm going to run memcheck now.  I'll be back when i'm done :-)  Any other pointers before I go?
2007-05-31T12:27:00.000Z	ikonia	tcblack	make sure its run through at least 3 full passes
2007-05-31T12:27:00.000Z	tcblack	ikonia	i'll do exactly that.
2007-05-31T12:28:00.000Z	ikonia	tcblack	good call, good to remove the obvious
