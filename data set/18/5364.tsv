2012-04-10T13:16:00.000Z	VOITHISTE		Hello I would like to know why ubuntu keeps asking root password instead of sudo. Any suggestions to fix that would be welcome :).
2012-04-10T13:17:00.000Z	mrintegr1ty	VOITHISTE	what command are you entering
2012-04-10T13:17:00.000Z	mrintegr1ty	VOITHISTE	have you previously set a root password?
2012-04-10T13:18:00.000Z	mrintegr1ty	VOITHISTE	so what happens when you run software center?
2012-04-10T13:19:00.000Z	mrintegr1ty	VOITHISTE	does it put up a window saying "enter root password" or what do you mean?
2012-04-10T13:20:00.000Z	mrintegr1ty	VOITHISTE	did you add yourself to the "admin" group?
2012-04-10T13:20:00.000Z	mrintegr1ty	VOITHISTE	when you installed ubuntu, it has a checkbox when you add the default user "add this user to administrators group"
2012-04-10T13:20:00.000Z	mrintegr1ty	VOITHISTE	if you open a terminal (gnome-terminal) and type "id" wihtout quotes what does it say
2012-04-10T13:21:00.000Z	mrintegr1ty	VOITHISTE	you are not in the admin group
2012-04-10T13:22:00.000Z	mrintegr1ty	VOITHISTE	as root run "gpasswd -G admin xristos"
2012-04-10T13:23:00.000Z	mrintegr1ty	VOITHISTE	that will add your user to the admin group and you should now be able to use sudo
2012-04-10T13:23:00.000Z	mrintegr1ty	VOITHISTE	if you know the root password, you can use "su -" to become root once and run that command i showed you
2012-04-10T13:24:00.000Z	mrintegr1ty	VOITHISTE	after that you should be able to use sudo, and the prompts from applications like software center should (hopefully) start using sudo and your own password instead of root
2012-04-10T13:24:00.000Z	mrintegr1ty	VOITHISTE	ah
2012-04-10T13:25:00.000Z	mrintegr1ty	VOITHISTE	that kinda sucks, it's a littl ebit of a hasstle to recover the root password. Simple but annoying
2012-04-10T13:26:00.000Z	mrintegr1ty	VOITHISTE	what you should do is reboot to the live cd and "chroot" into your installed ubuntu. once you did that you can then modify your user to be in the admin group. if your not a bit experienced then that might not mean anything to you but i can help you with it
2012-04-10T13:28:00.000Z	mrintegr1ty	VOITHISTE	you can accept advice from others or you can listen to one person
2012-04-10T13:30:00.000Z	mrintegr1ty	VOITHISTE	ok, it's actually a bit of a pain in the *** to fix so you have two options, 1. reboot into the live cd and "chroot" to your installed ubuntu, from there you can change anyting on the installed OS and you don't need the password (so you can fix it). 2. reinstall ubuntu, if this is a new install then that might be the easiest option for you but you can always try the chroot first.
