2011-11-04T17:11:00.000Z	helpless767		Hi. I'm using Ubuntu 10.10. Quite often, w/o any signs "metacity" hangs consuming 99% of CPU. It seems to ignore kill commands from then. Problem makes me have to restart whole PC. Here x-error log: http://paste.ubuntuusers.de/403832/ . Has anybody a clue whats wrong?
2011-11-04T17:13:00.000Z	jasef	helpless767	did you try using kill -9 or killall -9 instead of just the plain kill?
2011-11-04T17:16:00.000Z	helpless767	jasef	srry don't remember exactly what kill command i used. The problem for me is more that it happens quite often. So even if I could kill metacity in some way, I would have to restart whole x-session.
2011-11-04T17:16:00.000Z	jasef	helpless767	haven't noticed it happening to me recently - have you tried using the Ubuntu2D session instead?
2011-11-04T17:18:00.000Z	helpless767	jasef	no just standart mode. I guess I can choose this mode in login screen?
2011-11-04T17:19:00.000Z	jasef	helpless767	^ see above - sorry, forgot to put your name in the message :(
2011-11-04T17:19:00.000Z	helpless767	jasef	thx I'll try this next time. If it doesn't happen then for several hours, do you know anything that might be wrong with metacity?
2011-11-04T17:20:00.000Z	jasef	helpless767	no, I don't really know why - mine used to do it a bit but it stopped, I use 2D now though to save my resources.
2011-11-04T17:21:00.000Z	helpless767	jasef	seems to me like a real bug anyways. Maybe I'll post it into bug tracker....
2011-11-04T17:22:00.000Z	helpless767	jasef	ok thx for now. Got to get sth to eat ;) Bye
2011-11-04T17:23:00.000Z	jasef	helpless767	-.-. Sorry, my SOCKS proxy on my ubuntu server got disconnected
2011-11-04T17:23:00.000Z	helpless767	jasef	no problem ;) I'll try 2d session for now
2011-11-04T17:25:00.000Z	jasef	helpless767	I used to use Gnome3 as an alternative - works really nicely, except it ate too much of my RAM and battery, so I use Unity2D now.
2011-11-04T17:26:00.000Z	jasef	helpless767	so if Unity keeps crashing, you could try Gnome3 and see how that works, "sudo apt-get install gnome-shell"
2011-11-04T17:26:00.000Z	helpless767	jasef	battery comsume is too high on my side to.... But this is due to the lag of optimus support
2011-11-04T17:27:00.000Z	helpless767	jasef	took me hours to make scripts to send acpi commands by hand really annoying ...
2011-11-04T17:28:00.000Z	jasef	helpless767	lol, well my power consumption seems a LITTLE better since my most recent kernel update... don't know if it's coincidence or if they're actually fixing it. I have 3.1.0.2-2
2011-11-04T17:29:00.000Z	helpless767	jasef	as far as I know now, the problem on my side is known since over a year and still doesn't get fixed. Can't really understand. If I don't find workarounds I have no choice than to go back to windows...
