2009-05-22T00:12:00.000Z	zek		why did 9.04 disable ctrl alt backspace ??
2009-05-22T00:12:00.000Z	Pici	zek	Because xorg disabled it in their source.
2009-05-22T00:14:00.000Z	Pici	zek	You'd have to ask the Xorg developers that.  The Ubuntu developers did not make this decision.
2009-05-22T00:14:00.000Z	zek	Pici	ok sorry that was offtopic
2009-05-22T22:48:00.000Z	Pici	zek	Whats wrong with install stage out of the repos?
2009-05-22T22:48:00.000Z	zek	Pici	because it requires player and i need a newer build than is in the repository
2009-05-22T22:49:00.000Z	Pici	zek	If you're still installing the build dependencies out of the repositories you can do: sudo apt-get build-dep stage
2009-05-22T22:50:00.000Z	zek	Pici	what does build-dep do?
2009-05-22T22:50:00.000Z	Pici	zek	Installs all the build dependencies for that package.
2009-05-22T22:52:00.000Z	Pici	zek	It shouldnt, build-dep generally installs -dev packages
2009-05-22T22:52:00.000Z	zek	Pici	so it shouldnt harm my player build.  cause i really dont want to deal with that
2009-05-22T22:53:00.000Z	Pici	zek	The build dependences for a package are not the same as the actual dependencies for a package.
2009-05-22T22:53:00.000Z	zek	Pici	ok thanks
2009-05-22T22:54:00.000Z	zek	Pici	i still get the same errors
2009-05-22T22:55:00.000Z	Pici	zek	I don't know what to tell you then.  The source package that you have should tell you what its dependencies are, perhaps in the README or INSTALL files
2009-05-22T22:56:00.000Z	zek	Pici	i have the dependencies installed.  i dont think they are linking correctly or something.
2009-05-22T22:56:00.000Z	Pici	zek	Its also possible that the source has new dependencies compared to the version from the repositories
2009-05-22T22:57:00.000Z	zek	Pici	i went to the stage install guide and get the stuff it told me to
