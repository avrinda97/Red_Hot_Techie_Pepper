2008-02-13T08:42:00.000Z	aO|DB		Can someone help me? Apparently I have 4 "Primary" partitions, and there is 17 Gigs of unallocated space, I want to move the unallocated space to a diff partition.
2008-02-13T08:44:00.000Z	aO|DB		can i delete the swap??????
2008-02-13T08:45:00.000Z	aO|DB		well cant i just remake the swap after?
2008-02-13T08:45:00.000Z	astro76	aO|DB	yes swap would be easiest to delete then remake
2008-02-13T08:50:00.000Z	astro76	aO|DB	you resize a partition which is adjacent to the unallocated
2008-02-13T08:52:00.000Z	astro76	aO|DB	yes you have to potentially slide (move) other partitions to get it where it's needed
2008-02-13T08:55:00.000Z	astro76	aO|DB	the extended thing is the way to have more than 4 partitions
2008-02-13T08:56:00.000Z	aO|DB	astro76	how would i go about making it so that my windows XP and storage drive are inside it? (right now there is only my storage drive)
2008-02-13T08:56:00.000Z	astro76	aO|DB	you can have at max 4 primary partitions, so the "extended" container was created which can hold more partitions (called logical partitions)
2008-02-13T08:57:00.000Z	astro76	aO|DB	actually, everything can generally be logical... but windows usually demands to be a primary partition
2008-02-13T08:57:00.000Z	aO|DB	astro76	yea thats cool you can do that, how would i move the win xp partition into the sub partition?
2008-02-13T09:01:00.000Z	astro76	aO|DB	I don't think windows will boot if it were logical, also I don't think believe you can convert..
2008-02-13T09:02:00.000Z	astro76	aO|DB	what do you have now and what do you want to resize? could you pastebin the output of 'sudo parted /dev/sda print' and I'll take a look
2008-02-13T09:03:00.000Z	aO|DB	astro76	well i dont have IRC on LIVE
2008-02-13T09:04:00.000Z	aO|DB	astro76	but theres sda1 -> N
2008-02-13T09:04:00.000Z	aO|DB	astro76	but theres sda1 -> NTFS (windows)
2008-02-13T09:04:00.000Z	aO|DB	astro76	sda2 (which is extended) with only one thing under it (sda5 --> storeage)
2008-02-13T09:09:00.000Z	astro76	aO|DB	it's hard to tell you what to do without understanding your physical setup
