2005-05-28T08:37:00.000Z	sproingie		. o O ( hey i used hoary in the lovecraft sense )
2005-05-28T08:37:00.000Z	nickrud	sproingie	a well crafted sentence :)
2005-05-28T08:38:00.000Z	nickrud	sproingie	supposedly selinux is a baseline goal for breezy, we can hope
2005-05-28T08:39:00.000Z	sproingie	nickrud	that would be a big jump from debian, which seems unlikely to ever make it standard
2005-05-28T08:40:00.000Z	nickrud	sproingie	yeah, and I bit my tongue after saying that, I can be a parrot
2005-05-28T08:40:00.000Z	nickrud	sproingie	selinux is more than I need right now
2005-05-28T08:40:00.000Z	nickrud	sproingie	play with aptitude, I had fun during the c102 transition
2005-05-28T08:41:00.000Z	sproingie	nickrud	believe me, i've played with aptitude.  it won't play nice
2005-05-28T08:42:00.000Z	nickrud	sproingie	I am in love with aptitude, I kept the same machine working under unstable for years with it.
2005-05-28T08:42:00.000Z	nickrud	sproingie	but, it you
2005-05-28T08:42:00.000Z	sproingie	nickrud	glad to see another fan.  synaptic is overrated, aptitude is what dselect should have been
2005-05-28T08:43:00.000Z	sproingie	nickrud	i use aptitude quite happily under sid.  i just misunderstood ubuntu's development model and assumed breezy was just like sid
2005-05-28T08:44:00.000Z	nickrud	sproingie	lol, you were had :)
2005-05-28T08:44:00.000Z	sproingie	nickrud	i think i'll stick to hoary and use backports
2005-05-28T08:45:00.000Z	nickrud	sproingie	i'm content with hoary right now, and, since I've never had a 'stable' debian system, I'm kinda luxuriating
2005-08-08T11:59:00.000Z	nickrud	sproingie	if you're willing to be a testbed, fedora seems ok
2005-08-08T12:29:00.000Z	sproingie	nickrud	yes, they're both just front-ends to the apt database
2005-08-08T12:29:00.000Z	nickrud	sproingie	so is apt-get, but, aptitude maintains something extra
