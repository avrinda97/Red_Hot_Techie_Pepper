2008-06-28T09:33:00.000Z	Packman_e		just wanted to say hello to everyone, i just got Linux for the first time today and installed it just now. I have heard good things about it, and I hope my experience is good.
2008-06-28T09:34:00.000Z	L1nc01n	Packman_e	 What experience do you have with computers?
2008-06-28T09:35:00.000Z	Packman_e	L1nc01n	i have used windows, and am quite comfortable with computers
2008-06-28T09:36:00.000Z	L1nc01n	Packman_e	that's good.  I guess anyone that wasn't pretty good with computers would be bothering installing Linux anyways, haha.  I just ask because I installed Ubuntu two days ago and am trying to figure everything out
2008-06-28T09:36:00.000Z	Packman_e	L1nc01n	and how are you finding it so far?
2008-06-28T09:39:00.000Z	L1nc01n	Packman_e	 It's different...  I'm so used to not having to do anything with a terminal window or anything, not that you have to do much with Ubuntu, but it's taking some getting used to.  I find that more things are less intuitive, as in, you just are expected to know what to do +\\=]\]===========================================
2008-06-28T09:42:00.000Z	Packman_e	L1nc01n	hello mate, can you resend the last messages you sent to me please, because my chat client crashed

2008-06-28T09:50:00.000Z	Packman_e	L1nc01n	its happened again, xchat keeps on crashing
2008-06-28T10:10:00.000Z	L1nc01n	Packman_e	 You still there?
2008-06-28T10:26:00.000Z	Packman_e	L1nc01n	hey

2008-06-28T10:36:00.000Z	L1nc01n	Packman_e	 I first learned C++ in High School, then did Java a little bit, and when I got to college I learned C, and then Java some more.  If I was you, I would try and get into C.  It's more "lower level" than the others and makes you understand more of how programming actually works in my opinion
2008-06-28T10:38:00.000Z	Packman_e	L1nc01n	 i heard that learning c is like playing with sharp knives
2008-06-28T10:42:00.000Z	L1nc01n	Packman_e	Well, I don't know about that, haha.  I think it's just the kind of thinker you are.  In my opinion its a lot easier for me to understand programming from the ground up.  I really like assembly language and stuff, and C is not too far off.  If you really get down and dirty you get to see how processors manipulate the bits, and store shit in buffers and read this and do that, yaddy yadda.  And then you have people who
2008-06-28T10:43:00.000Z	Packman_e	L1nc01n	you like asembly!! man thats like chewing broken glass!
2008-06-28T10:44:00.000Z	L1nc01n	Packman_e	 I didn't complete one of my sentences back there, but I think you get the idea
2008-06-28T10:45:00.000Z	L1nc01n	Packman_e	well it is frustrating sometimes, but I just like being able to know how everything is working.  With a lot of higher level stuff you just trust functions to work and never know how they do it, which is fine, but it usually makes me feel like I'm not understanding something or whatever
