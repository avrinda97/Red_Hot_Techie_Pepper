2010-01-19T16:12:00.000Z	meowbuntu	joep	how much space is left in the homefolder i wonder
2010-01-19T16:14:00.000Z	joep	meowbuntu	Well that's the problem. It is an USB-stick of 2 GB and 1 GB is free. However I don't know what linux does with a FAT32 partition.

2010-01-19T16:17:00.000Z	meowbuntu		sorry joep i dont know
2010-01-19T16:17:00.000Z	joep	meowbuntu	Well, I'm afraid that will not solve the problem as the OS is installed using the USb creator function in SYStem -> administration.
2010-01-19T16:18:00.000Z	joep	meowbuntu	thanks for the try. I hope somebody else has an idea.
2010-01-19T16:18:00.000Z	meowbuntu	joep	how does that set up os on flash drive
2010-01-19T16:19:00.000Z	meowbuntu	joep	usb-creator needs a live cd or .iso of ubuntu
2010-01-19T16:19:00.000Z	joep	meowbuntu	I used the function: USB startup DIsk creator which is in my Karmic setting under: SYStem -> administration
2010-01-19T16:20:00.000Z	joep	meowbuntu	Of course I installed the OS (in this case Hardy) from a downloaded .iso file.
2010-01-19T16:20:00.000Z	meowbuntu	joep	ok its a live install i'm deffinatly not so clued up on that
