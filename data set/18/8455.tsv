2007-12-19T14:27:00.000Z	EvanR	macogw	irssi disagrees :)
2007-12-19T14:27:00.000Z	macogw	EvanR	oh ok. i didnt see a bunch disappear on #ubuntu-offtopic
2007-12-19T14:27:00.000Z	EvanR	macogw	not many are disappearing in my other channels either just here
2007-12-19T14:27:00.000Z	macogw	EvanR	how does irssi know when its a netsplit?
2007-12-19T14:33:00.000Z	macogw	EvanR	wma isnt a movie format
2007-12-19T14:33:00.000Z	macogw	EvanR	Windows Media Audio
2007-12-19T14:33:00.000Z	macogw	EvanR	you're thinking of wmv
2007-12-19T14:54:00.000Z	EvanR	macogw	memory is still in 4byte integers
2007-12-19T14:54:00.000Z	macogw	EvanR	really? that seems odd.  how are they using 1/2 words?
2007-12-19T14:54:00.000Z	EvanR	macogw	the same way you can use short ints in 32bit
2007-12-19T14:55:00.000Z	macogw	EvanR	do they just put 0's in the empty bits?
2007-12-19T14:55:00.000Z	macogw	EvanR	so they split it mid-word?
2007-12-19T14:56:00.000Z	EvanR	macogw	this is all the job of the c library, and the instructions allow for using both sides of the word
2007-12-19T14:56:00.000Z	macogw	EvanR	addressing would be weird like that.  you'd have 2 pieces of data in the same address, wouldnt you?
2007-12-19T14:57:00.000Z	EvanR	macogw	man, i forgot all this.. :(
2007-12-19T14:58:00.000Z	macogw	EvanR	heh im forgetting too.  that was beginning of the semester stuff, so i'm a little fuzzy
2007-12-19T14:58:00.000Z	EvanR	macogw	we never see the physical addresses anyway
