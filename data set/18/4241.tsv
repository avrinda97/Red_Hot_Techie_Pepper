2009-05-13T00:28:00.000Z	Cursed_Cookie		or did you keep the old one?
2009-05-13T00:29:00.000Z	thiebaude	Cursed_Cookie	after you setup dual boot then grub should give you a choice of whitch OS's to boot up
2009-05-13T00:30:00.000Z	Cursed_Cookie	thiebaude	yes that was what i expected, but somehow, on my last upgrade, i was able to boot into both ubuntu and windows [i was using windows chainload, not grub]
2009-05-13T00:30:00.000Z	thiebaude	Cursed_Cookie	maybe you should use grub
2009-05-13T00:31:00.000Z	thiebaude	Cursed_Cookie	i hope everything goes great, i know everytime i dual booted, i had no problems
2009-05-13T00:32:00.000Z	thiebaude	Cursed_Cookie	keep us informed of what happens
2009-05-13T00:34:00.000Z	thiebaude	Cursed_Cookie	you ever tried a virtual machine
2009-05-13T00:34:00.000Z	thiebaude	Cursed_Cookie	i dont know too much about it, i dont have enough RAM to use it
2009-05-13T00:35:00.000Z	thiebaude	Cursed_Cookie	yup
