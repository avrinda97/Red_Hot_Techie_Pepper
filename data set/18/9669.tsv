2008-01-10T20:28:00.000Z	jrib	keisangi	what is the output of the command: groups
2008-01-10T20:28:00.000Z	keisangi	jrib	i look
2008-01-10T20:28:00.000Z	keisangi	jrib	 it's:    keisangi admin
2008-01-10T20:30:00.000Z	jrib	keisangi	you need to add your user to the audio group.  There are other groups as well that you should be in.  Use the gui maybe (system -> adiministration -> users and groups)
2008-01-10T20:30:00.000Z	keisangi	jrib	ok i try
2008-01-10T20:32:00.000Z	keisangi	jrib	i try reboot now ..brb

2008-10-11T15:08:00.000Z	jrib	keisangi	how are you starting in text mode?
2008-10-11T15:09:00.000Z	keisangi	jrib	i added "text" at the end of kernel  line in grub menu
2008-10-11T15:10:00.000Z	jrib	keisangi	I don't know what that does, but instead I would undo that and just disable the gdm service from starting with System -> Administration -> Services
2008-10-11T15:10:00.000Z	keisangi	jrib	i don't use gnome, what command is that ? ( System -> Administration -> Services )
2008-10-11T15:11:00.000Z	jrib	keisangi	services-admin
2008-10-11T15:11:00.000Z	keisangi	jrib	thanks, i will try that
2008-10-11T15:12:00.000Z	jrib	keisangi	"graphical login" is what it is referred to as
