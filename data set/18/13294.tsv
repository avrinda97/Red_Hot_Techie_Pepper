2005-12-09T14:01:00.000Z	PokerFacePenguin	scottishkiwi	if  you have signal....it is an ip problem most likely
2005-12-09T14:01:00.000Z	PokerFacePenguin	scottishkiwi	are you using dhcp?  if so do a sudo dhclient interfacex
2005-12-09T14:04:00.000Z	scottishkiwi		Hi pokerfacepenguin.  I'll try that command in a second.
2005-12-09T14:05:00.000Z	PokerFacePenguin	scottishkiwi	where interfacex is your interface name of course...i think you said it was eth2
2005-12-09T14:07:00.000Z	scottishkiwi	PokerFacePenguin	- can I paste you the output in a private message?
2005-12-09T14:07:00.000Z	PokerFacePenguin		yes
2005-12-09T14:08:00.000Z	PokerFacePenguin	scottishkiwi	yes
2005-12-09T14:08:00.000Z	scottishkiwi	PokerFacePenguin	- Hopefully you can see it
2005-12-09T14:08:00.000Z	PokerFacePenguin	scottishkiwi	not if you arent registered
2005-12-09T14:09:00.000Z	scottishkiwi		Ah.  I'm not registered.  Damn newbie!
2005-12-09T14:09:00.000Z	PokerFacePenguin		did you type sudo before dhclient eth2
2005-12-09T14:10:00.000Z	PokerFacePenguin	scottishkiwi	sudo dhclient eth2  gets you an ip address and automatically sets your default route to the router
2005-12-09T14:10:00.000Z	scottishkiwi		Yes I did.  The final 2 lines were no DHCPOFFERS received.  No working leases in persistent database - sleeping
2005-12-09T14:11:00.000Z	PokerFacePenguin	scottishkiwi	when  you type an ifconfig does it say interface is up AND _has signal_ ?
2005-12-09T14:12:00.000Z	PokerFacePenguin	scottishkiwi	ifconfig and iwconfig are your friends for t/shooting this kinda thing
2005-12-09T14:13:00.000Z	scottishkiwi		Link quality is 15.  Signal level 0.  Noise level 244.  I have excellent line of site - and have never had any issues with signal.
2005-12-09T14:13:00.000Z	scottishkiwi		thanks PokerFacePenguin.  THis is really appreciated.
