2011-10-25T21:12:00.000Z	meowsus		I have a strange problem I might not be able to describe very well: I'm running Oneiric with Unity, and when, say, a gnome terminal window is maximized and a command produces a lot of information on the screen, the text sometimes becomes garbled, on the left side - at almost exactly at the width of the Unity bar. I have to scroll up and down to make the terminal show the information properly. I'll take a screenshot.
2011-10-25T21:12:00.000Z	meowsus		... if i can reproduce it
2011-10-25T21:12:00.000Z	bassliner	meowsus	screenshot would pretty much help. :)
2011-10-25T21:13:00.000Z	bassliner		when moving a window in ubuntu 11.10 with unity, it is easily possible to "lose" the window under the mouse pointer by moving the window around a bit, especially to the upper screen border. the cursor then is like 100px "over" the window or so, making moving windows feel terrible. any idea what component is causing this?
2011-10-25T21:13:00.000Z	meowsus	bassliner	dang, easier said than done, it happens pretty randomly it seems
2011-10-25T21:14:00.000Z	bassliner	meowsus	i'm not able to screenshot my issue, too, because pointer will not be grabbed in such situations. even scrot doesn't have an option to include the pointer. :(
2011-10-25T21:15:00.000Z	meowsus	bassliner	check out shutter, i think theres an option to save the cursor in the screenshot
2011-10-25T21:21:00.000Z	meowsus		Well, here's another issue I've been experiencing <http://www.screenshots.cc/photos/thumb/50810-8wtc8.jpg> Whenever I'm working with full screen windows in Oneiric running Unity, this appears, but I'm not dragging a window over to the left side to enable this feature. The window is maximized every time i see this.
2011-10-25T21:22:00.000Z	meowsus		I have to unminimize and then remaximize to fix it. Hitting ESC or clicking around does nothing.
2011-10-25T21:23:00.000Z	meowsus	bassliner	!!! I got it to do it again, but as soon as i hit printscreen it fixes itself!
2011-10-25T21:24:00.000Z	meowsus		It's almost like the output is layered on top of itself
2011-10-25T21:27:00.000Z	bassliner	meowsus	you could try something like: sleep 5 && scrot screenshot.png
2011-10-25T21:27:00.000Z	bassliner	meowsus	and then see if you can reproduce it within 5 secs
2011-10-25T21:28:00.000Z	bassliner	meowsus	shutter seems to be much to huge to justify an installation. it wants 40mbyte of binary stuff, which i think is not acceptable.
2011-10-25T21:28:00.000Z	bassliner		+o
2011-10-25T21:30:00.000Z	meowsus	bassliner	I guess you're right. I use it for all of its easy screenshot editing capabilities, which are way quicker to use than GIMP
2011-10-25T21:30:00.000Z	meowsus		I just knew it had a cursor capture setting
2011-10-25T21:31:00.000Z	bassliner	meowsus	well thank you. :)
