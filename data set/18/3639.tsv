2009-08-29T23:55:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	Shasirax	you would have better results with Cedega
2009-08-29T23:55:00.000Z	Shasirax	b3rz3rk3r	I will try PlayOnLinux first :)
2009-08-29T23:56:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	Shasirax	ok, but its really just a front end to help configure Wine for those that are technically challenged
2009-08-29T23:57:00.000Z	Shasirax	b3rz3rk3r	Ok, do you know how to use it?
2009-08-29T23:58:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	Shasirax	its much like the "Add/Remove" version of games for WINE
2009-08-29T23:58:00.000Z	Shasirax	b3rz3rk3r	Yes, but how do i start it?
2009-08-29T23:59:00.000Z	Shasirax	b3rz3rk3r	Can't find it anywhere -.- :(
2009-08-29T23:59:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	Shasirax	Cedega gets all the fixes first, and tehy contribute to WINE (as they are the same devs) so if u are serious about gaming in UBuntu, get Cedega is my recommendation
2009-08-29T23:59:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	Shasirax	you need to DL it from their site i think
2009-08-29T23:59:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	Shasirax	but really, dont bother, if you have WINE, its the same thing
2009-08-30T00:00:00.000Z	Shasirax	b3rz3rk3r	Ok, is cedega free?
2009-08-30T00:00:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	Shasirax	the install and demo is (though u need to get an account -also free)
2009-08-30T00:01:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	Shasirax	but they charge you a small fee each month for contiued updates
2009-08-30T00:01:00.000Z	Shasirax	b3rz3rk3r	:/ i hate paying to play games...
2009-08-30T00:01:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	Shasirax	me too man
2009-08-30T00:02:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	Shasirax	luckily there is always dual-boot ;)
2009-08-30T00:02:00.000Z	b3rz3rk3r	Shasirax	use a Livecd to fix it :)
2009-08-30T00:03:00.000Z	Shasirax	b3rz3rk3r	I have tried evrything...
