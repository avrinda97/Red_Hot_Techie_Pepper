2008-06-02T02:20:00.000Z	friggityfrog		anyone? is 50c a bad idle temp for a pentium M 1.5ghz
2008-06-02T02:22:00.000Z	friggityfrog		are my idle temp's high? Doing nothing, acpi -t returns about 50c
2008-06-02T02:22:00.000Z	friggityfrog		oops, sorry repeat

2008-06-02T02:23:00.000Z	RAdams	friggityfrog	using smart fan or qfan control in your BIOS?
2008-06-02T02:23:00.000Z	friggityfrog	RAdams	I have no idea
2008-06-02T02:23:00.000Z	friggityfrog	RAdams	my bro installed ubuntu for me...
2008-06-02T02:23:00.000Z	RAdams	friggityfrog	what's your computer? custom, factory built, etc?
2008-06-02T02:24:00.000Z	friggityfrog	RAdams	a gateway craptop M405
2008-06-02T02:24:00.000Z	RAdams	friggityfrog	ah. go into your bios when you boot, look under power management setup and turn off smart fan management
2008-06-02T02:25:00.000Z	friggityfrog	RAdams	Ok, what does that do? Will the OS handle it then?
2008-06-02T02:25:00.000Z	RAdams	friggityfrog	no, the fans will just run all the time. i was about to type back to you, do this to test and see if the temp runs lower more often
2008-06-02T02:26:00.000Z	friggityfrog	RAdams	ah, thanks that makes sense. If it does run cooler, that means my fans are not operating correctly?
2008-06-02T02:27:00.000Z	RAdams	friggityfrog	it means either the sensors are going, or there's a problem with the motherboard
2008-06-02T02:28:00.000Z	friggityfrog	RAdams	thanks
