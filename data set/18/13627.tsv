2006-01-05T07:01:00.000Z	raphink	Manifold	grub and lilo are boot managers
2006-01-05T07:02:00.000Z	raphink	Manifold	yes
2006-01-07T08:25:00.000Z	raphink	Manifold	why do you want to install a deb file?
2006-01-07T08:30:00.000Z	raphink	Manifold	this is either synching or merging
2006-01-07T08:31:00.000Z	raphink	Manifold	if there's no change to apply to the deb, then we just sync it with Debian
2006-01-07T08:31:00.000Z	raphink	Manifold	if there are things to change in the deb, then we merge it
2006-01-07T08:31:00.000Z	raphink	Manifold	come to #ubuntu-motu to talk about that
