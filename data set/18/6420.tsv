2008-05-13T20:10:00.000Z	no7up4u2	newair	i use wusb54gc and wg511t and the build in centrino and all work smoothly
2008-05-13T20:11:00.000Z	Shadu		﻿no7up4u2: but isn't there a legal way to connect to it? as i gotta connect to the wireless network (which gives a new certificate) then i gotta login and think i then get the key for the wep
2008-05-13T20:11:00.000Z	no7up4u2		shadu ask the amin for the key, if they want u in they'll give it to you

2008-05-13T20:12:00.000Z	Shadu		﻿no7up4u2: yeah but to get the key they made some weird login thingy.. but i guess i can go to the IT service and ask them how to do it
2008-05-13T20:12:00.000Z	no7up4u2		shadu that would be the right thing to do
