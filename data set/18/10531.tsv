2007-12-12T05:42:00.000Z	helluvaCSMajor		random folders keep appearing in my home folder
2007-12-12T05:43:00.000Z	helluvaCSMajor		how do i fix it?
2007-12-12T05:43:00.000Z	Slart	helluvaCSMajor	random folders show up in your home-folder? what names do these folders have? when were they created? owner? contents?
2007-12-12T05:44:00.000Z	Slart	helluvaCSMajor	are they called stuff like \013\220\111\065..... ?
2007-12-12T05:44:00.000Z	Slart	helluvaCSMajor	do a ls -l of your home folder and pastebin the result
2007-12-12T05:47:00.000Z	Slart	helluvaCSMajor	hmm.. it looks the same in nautilus?
2007-12-12T05:50:00.000Z	Slart	helluvaCSMajor	I don't think this has got anything to do with you mounting your ntfs drive... I think this is something else..
2007-12-12T05:51:00.000Z	Slart	helluvaCSMajor	unless... how did you mount your ntfs-drive? manually? what command did you use?
2007-12-12T05:52:00.000Z	Slart	helluvaCSMajor	ok.. just thinking .. what would happen if you accidently mounted a ntfs-drive with your home-folder as mountpoint..
2007-12-12T05:53:00.000Z	Slart	helluvaCSMajor	could you pastebin the output from ps -A for us?
2007-12-12T05:53:00.000Z	Slart	helluvaCSMajor	just to see if something is running amok in the background..
2007-12-12T05:54:00.000Z	Slart	helluvaCSMajor	do these folders show up when you do something special? or just randomly every now and then?
2007-12-12T05:58:00.000Z	Slart	helluvaCSMajor	well.. nothing strange in there.. one instance of "sh" is running..but that might just be something running a script or something
2007-12-12T06:00:00.000Z	Slart	helluvaCSMajor	I don't think beryl would do that... never had it creating folders all over the place..
2007-12-12T06:00:00.000Z	Slart	helluvaCSMajor	were the folders empty? no files in there?
2007-12-12T06:03:00.000Z	Slart	helluvaCSMajor	I would go with Jordan_U's suggestion.. create another user and see if the same thing happens to that users home folder.. second choice would be to run lsof and try to catch whatever is doing this "in the act" so to say..
