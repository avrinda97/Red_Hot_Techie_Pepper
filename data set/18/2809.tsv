2010-03-13T11:29:00.000Z	Semitones	Edwardo	ask your question here please
2010-03-13T11:33:00.000Z	Semitones	Edwardo	the best thing to do I think would be to connect your pc to the internet with a wired connection temporarily, and download the drivers that way
2010-03-13T11:35:00.000Z	Semitones	Edwardo	the first thing you should do is get the latest updates, using update manager
2010-03-13T11:35:00.000Z	Semitones	Edwardo	that often solves many problems after installing from a live cd
2010-03-13T11:36:00.000Z	Edwardo	Semitones	i pray to god your right..
2010-03-13T11:36:00.000Z	Semitones	Edwardo	if that doesn't work, there are other things we can do, don't worry
2010-03-13T11:37:00.000Z	Edwardo	Semitones	while the updates are installing.. I'm sorry for flipping out
2010-03-13T11:39:00.000Z	Semitones	Edwardo	that does seem like a tough spot!
2010-03-13T11:39:00.000Z	Semitones	Edwardo	when I first installed ubuntu, my screen wasn't detected at all -- you can imagine how upset I was then :P
2010-03-13T11:40:00.000Z	Semitones	Edwardo	I've heard other people mention something similar, so if you find out why that happens, I'd like to know too
2010-03-13T11:53:00.000Z	Semitones	Edwardo	still updating?
2010-03-13T12:26:00.000Z	Edwardo	Semitones	The Updates are NEARLY finished
2010-03-13T12:31:00.000Z	Edwardo	Semitones	Okay, updating done, nothing happened Semitones
2010-03-13T12:31:00.000Z	Semitones	Edwardo	ok, that's normal. the next step is to actually install the drivers now that the system is up to date
2010-03-13T12:32:00.000Z	Semitones	Edwardo	try going to system>administration>hardware drivers (or something like that)
2010-03-13T12:38:00.000Z	Semitones	Edwardo	a little context please? I'm not an expert on wifi or anything :)
2010-03-13T12:38:00.000Z	Semitones	Edwardo	where did you see the message for one thing
2010-03-13T12:40:00.000Z	Semitones	Edwardo	try googling relating to that line -- someone else may have had the same problem, and already found a fix
