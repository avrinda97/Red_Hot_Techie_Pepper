2011-08-13T01:37:00.000Z	bobweaver		that is how we all learn from each other
2011-08-13T01:39:00.000Z	bobweaver		is there a way to take the system that I have right now then which is 10.10 and upgrade to 11.04 here is the catch I have other repos that are for 10.10
2011-08-13T01:40:00.000Z	bobweaver		how to keep all programs install and working that are for 10.10 on 11.04
2011-08-13T01:40:00.000Z	glebihan	bobweaver	your third party repositories will be disabled during the upgrade
2011-08-13T01:41:00.000Z	glebihan	bobweaver	after the upgrade you will be able to re-enable them (but you should make sure they are compatible)
2011-08-13T01:41:00.000Z	bobweaver	glebihan	 to make sure that they are compadibal
2011-08-13T01:43:00.000Z	glebihan	bobweaver	if those third party repositories are ppas, they should also be available for 11.04
2011-08-13T01:43:00.000Z	bobweaver	glebihan	I see up grade the repos then updater and upgrade should fix it ?
2011-08-13T01:45:00.000Z	glebihan	bobweaver	it should, but as I said you should be careful with third party repositories
2011-08-13T01:46:00.000Z	glebihan	bobweaver	I most likely won't be able to tell you
2011-08-13T01:50:00.000Z	glebihan	bobweaver	the repo for the tor project shouldn't cause any issues, you'll have to check if inundator has packages for natty
2011-08-13T01:51:00.000Z	glebihan	bobweaver	you're welcome
2011-11-02T02:14:00.000Z	glebihan	bobweaver	depends on what you need exactly
2011-11-03T02:35:00.000Z	glebihan	bobweaver	not sure that's what you want but maybe you could try this : ffmpeg -f x11grab -s $(xwininfo -root | awk '/geometry/ {print $2}') -i :0.0 -b 800k -y output.avi
2011-11-03T02:36:00.000Z	bobweaver	glebihan	 SWEET
2011-11-03T02:39:00.000Z	bobweaver	glebihan	 LOOKS great
2011-11-03T02:39:00.000Z	bobweaver	glebihan	 time to make a alais
2011-11-03T02:39:00.000Z	glebihan	bobweaver	good idea ;)
