2007-12-22T14:54:00.000Z	r3n0c		anybody know how to get scp to work?
2007-12-22T14:54:00.000Z	r3n0c		i just want to use it to connect to my ftp server, to have the traffic be encrypted
2007-12-22T14:55:00.000Z	r3n0c		so i can't ftp to a server and look around first?
2007-12-22T14:56:00.000Z	r3n0c		ls
2007-12-22T14:57:00.000Z	r3n0c		someobdy earlier said use scp
2007-12-22T14:57:00.000Z	Nicke	r3n0c	If using gnome, you can type ssh://server in Nautilus to browse the files
2007-12-22T14:57:00.000Z	r3n0c		but it an ftp server
2007-12-22T14:58:00.000Z	Nicke		yeah
2007-12-22T14:58:00.000Z	r3n0c		i was just using ftp to connect
2007-12-22T14:58:00.000Z	r3n0c		i was just wondering how to encrypt it
2007-12-22T14:58:00.000Z	r3n0c		the host is using filezilla on a windows box
2007-12-22T14:59:00.000Z	r3n0c		is there an easy way to setup ssl on it?
2007-12-22T15:00:00.000Z	r3n0c		o ok, so on the host i would have to have ssh setup
2007-12-22T15:00:00.000Z	r3n0c		thats what i was thikning, i was confused about just using scp to ssh to the ftp server
2007-12-22T15:00:00.000Z	r3n0c		lol
2007-12-22T15:00:00.000Z	r3n0c		argh i have to go to sleep soon, it is 5am
2007-12-22T15:01:00.000Z	r3n0c	predaeus	ok, i guess either time to put linux on my windows box or to go find a ssh client
2007-12-22T15:01:00.000Z	Nicke	r3n0c	The Filezilla client supports ssl, no idea about the server though
