2005-07-01T10:44:00.000Z	jessicaNZ		there doesn't seem to be any way to resize the partition in the ubuntu installation dialogue
2005-07-01T10:44:00.000Z	jessicaNZ		are you sure it's possible?
2005-07-01T10:44:00.000Z	reka	jessicaNZ	it's sort of hidden unfortunately.  what stage are you up to?
2005-07-01T10:45:00.000Z	jessicaNZ	reka	[!!]  Partition disks
2005-07-01T10:46:00.000Z	reka	jessicaNZ	and you see a list with a partition with "NTFS" next to it right?
2005-07-01T10:46:00.000Z	reka	jessicaNZ	select manually edit partition table.
2005-07-01T10:49:00.000Z	jessicaNZ	reka	there's nothing here about resizing
2005-07-01T10:49:00.000Z	reka	jessicaNZ	i know.  like i said, it's kind of hidden.
2005-07-01T10:49:00.000Z	reka	jessicaNZ	higlight the size field and press enter
2005-07-01T10:50:00.000Z	jessicaNZ	reka	the field that says ntfs?
2005-07-01T10:51:00.000Z	reka	jessicaNZ	[1]  higlight the NTFS partition and press enter [2]  highlight the size field and press enter [3]  enter a new size
2005-07-01T10:51:00.000Z	reka	jessicaNZ	there may be intermediary steps
2005-07-01T10:54:00.000Z	reka	jessicaNZ	then [1]  highlight the newly created free space [2]  automatically partition
2005-07-01T10:56:00.000Z	reka	jessicaNZ	then [1]  highlight the newly created free space [2]  automatically partition
2005-07-01T11:02:00.000Z	reka	jessicaNZ	just auto-partition
2005-07-01T11:09:00.000Z	reka	jessicaNZ	iirc, you put both the smiley face and the thunderbolt on the / partition
