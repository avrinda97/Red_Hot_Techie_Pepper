2008-09-13T21:23:00.000Z	Ab3L		well, but doing so the file is not in the original folder. it is not possible to restore the file to the original folder from trash using nautilus?
2008-09-13T21:23:00.000Z	zoe1	Ab3L	open the trash and open the other folder. Then drag the file from the trash to the other filder
2008-09-13T21:23:00.000Z	zoe1		s/filder/folder/
2008-09-13T21:25:00.000Z	Ab3L	zoe1	but if i have several files that was deleted from several folders, i would like that they go directly to the respective folders. have i to do it manually ?
2008-09-13T21:26:00.000Z	Ab3L		i mean, have i to find from which folder they come and drag them back to it ?
2008-09-13T21:26:00.000Z	zoe1	Ab3L	I see your point.
2008-09-13T21:26:00.000Z	zoe1		!trash
2008-09-13T21:29:00.000Z	Ab3L		in ~/.local/share/Trash there are two folders, one of them contains a info file where there are the original position of the file. do you know if nautilus is able to use that info to restore files or not? and if yes, how?
