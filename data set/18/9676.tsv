2007-03-07T14:59:00.000Z	Ashex	BlueGaust	is it a winmodem?
2007-03-07T15:01:00.000Z	BlueGaust	Ashex	no
2007-03-07T15:01:00.000Z	BlueGaust		i think :S
2007-03-07T15:02:00.000Z	Ashex	BlueGaust	check to see if it's a winmodem or an actual hardware modem. WinModems are basically cheap modems that use software emulation to function as a modem
2007-03-07T15:02:00.000Z	BlueGaust	Ashex	it is free, my provider gave it to me.
2007-03-07T15:03:00.000Z	BlueGaust	Ashex	i have just verified
2007-03-07T15:03:00.000Z	BlueGaust		yes it is winmodem :S
2007-03-07T15:04:00.000Z	Ashex	BlueGaust	ah, it's a external dsl modem
2007-03-07T15:04:00.000Z	BlueGaust	Ashex	yes
2007-03-07T15:05:00.000Z	BlueGaust	Ashex	what can i do? -.-"
