2009-05-29T03:38:00.000Z	gartral	unkmar	im not trying to copy a symlink, i have data on my drive, and its trying to MAKE a symlink to it on the flashdrive

2009-05-29T03:43:00.000Z	unkmar	gartral	then pastebin the log.txt file.  We will see if we can locate the links that are causing the problem.
2009-05-29T03:46:00.000Z	unkmar	gartral	I agree with casperfoo. there must be some symlinks in the source directory.
