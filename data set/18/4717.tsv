2009-02-23T01:39:00.000Z	Izinucs		I'd like to slocate all wma files in my ~ and move them to <new directory> from the terminal.. doing it this way will save me hours of locating and copying.
2009-02-23T01:41:00.000Z	Izinucs		maybe something like .. slocate *wma | -exec cp <something here> <new directory> *  usser *
2009-02-23T01:41:00.000Z	FM	Izinucs	try this: find ~ .name "*.wma" -exec mv {} /newdirectory \;
2009-02-23T01:42:00.000Z	FM	Izinucs	sorry, that should read: find ~ -name "*.wma" -exec mv {} newdir \;
2009-02-23T01:43:00.000Z	FM	Izinucs	yes you can
2009-02-23T01:43:00.000Z	Izinucs	FM	usser thanks.. I'll give it a shot. :)
2009-02-23T01:44:00.000Z	FM	Izinucs	good luck
2009-02-23T01:53:00.000Z	FM	Izinucs	hmmm, the "-r" will not help you there....
2009-02-23T01:53:00.000Z	FM	Izinucs	let see...
2009-02-23T01:53:00.000Z	Izinucs	FM	there's gotta be a way to do it.. :)
2009-02-23T01:54:00.000Z	FM	Izinucs	what is the exact message you're getting while trying to copy those files?
2009-02-23T01:55:00.000Z	Izinucs	FM	yada yada ... permission denied
2009-02-23T01:55:00.000Z	Izinucs	FM	yada yada = file location
2009-02-23T01:56:00.000Z	FM	Izinucs	try with "sudo find ~ -name "*.wma" -exec cp -p {} newdir \;"
2009-02-23T01:56:00.000Z	Izinucs	FM	what's the -p option?
2009-02-23T01:57:00.000Z	FM	Izinucs	It should preserve the permissions after copying the file. It is not mandatory though
2009-02-23T02:00:00.000Z	Izinucs	FM	do wma's need an execute bit set?  seems weird.. almost all the wma's copying have either 777 (the ones that I changed) or 333 permissions (-wx-wx-wx)
2009-02-23T02:01:00.000Z	FM	Izinucs	No, they don't need it. Probably some messy permissions due to copy procedure from a windows file system
