2009-01-21T18:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	asdfasdfasdf	does it happen for all users? (you could create a test user to test)
2009-01-21T18:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	asdfasdfasdf	if its ok for the test user, rename ALL ~/.gnome* folders and reboot
2009-01-21T18:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	asdfasdfasdf	if it happens in the test user, its te app thats broken
