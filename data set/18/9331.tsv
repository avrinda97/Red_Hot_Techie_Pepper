2009-01-16T19:30:00.000Z	scunizi	knut	why would you need wine for mac? what is it you need to run on a mac that might require wine?
2009-01-16T19:30:00.000Z	knut	scunizi	i mean an application the emulates mac instead of windows
2009-01-16T19:31:00.000Z	scunizi	knut	ah..
2009-01-16T19:31:00.000Z	knut	scunizi	u know one?
2009-01-16T19:34:00.000Z	scunizi	knut	nope.. but mac is based in unix with apple's personal tweeks.. their system is very similar to linux.. so if you're a programmer or tinker-er, you might be able to port programs over, develop something that will allow them to run like wine or simply use a different program that is designed for linux.  That's why I've stayed away from ipod's/touches etc.. to  locked it.
2009-01-16T19:35:00.000Z	scunizi	knut	not sure if it's available for the touch but rockbox is available for ipods.. I understand it's a good alternative to apples interface and opens the ipod up so even ogg files will play
2009-01-16T19:37:00.000Z	knut	scunizi	i need it on my laptop
2009-01-16T19:37:00.000Z	knut	scunizi	simply ubuntuhave itunes for
2009-01-16T19:38:00.000Z	scunizi	knut	virtual box and an install of windows will allow you to install itunes
2009-01-16T19:39:00.000Z	knut	scunizi	i dont want to start a virtual pc just to listen to music
2009-01-16T19:40:00.000Z	knut	scunizi	then rhythmbox would be neough
2009-01-16T19:40:00.000Z	scunizi	knut	naw.. just to sync  there are tools to rip the music out of the ipod database in linux and play it. drm is an issue
