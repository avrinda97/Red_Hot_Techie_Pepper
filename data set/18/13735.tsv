2007-01-10T15:48:00.000Z	talisein	freakabcd	that's the new splash screen, if you're tlaking about no text
2007-01-10T15:48:00.000Z	freakabcd	talisein	no it is not the _new_ usplash. its just got quiet as the default option.
2007-01-10T15:49:00.000Z	freakabcd	talisein	if you want remove the quiet and see the messages
2007-01-10T15:51:00.000Z	talisein	freakabcd	hmm, mine has been offcenter too.

2007-01-10T15:55:00.000Z	freakabcd	talisein	so it is off-centre for you too, correct?
2007-01-10T15:55:00.000Z	talisein	freakabcd	looks like you need to edit /etc/usplash.conf
2007-01-10T15:55:00.000Z	talisein	freakabcd	and change the respolution
2007-01-10T15:56:00.000Z	freakabcd	talisein	i've already done that twice :)
2007-01-10T15:57:00.000Z	talisein	freakabcd	you did the update-initramfs -u?
2007-01-10T15:58:00.000Z	freakabcd	talisein	err.. ofcourse you have to do it everytime you change the conf file
2007-01-10T15:58:00.000Z	talisein	freakabcd	just checking
