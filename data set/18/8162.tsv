2008-05-05T16:57:00.000Z	bazhang		packages.ubuntu.com has them all sledgeas
2008-05-05T16:58:00.000Z	sledgeas	bazhang	it has ALL the packages. i need to know, which are on the freshly installed box or .iso 1CD image
2008-05-05T16:58:00.000Z	sledgeas	bazhang	im dealing with the offline installation here
2008-05-05T16:58:00.000Z	bazhang	sledgeas	dpkg -l
2008-05-05T16:59:00.000Z	sledgeas	bazhang	this won't list the CD contents, i don't have this box now, is there a way I can do it online, or you guys could help me
2008-05-05T16:59:00.000Z	bazhang	sledgeas	you dont want to see my dpkg -l as I have kde3 kde4 and gnome :)
2008-05-05T17:00:00.000Z	sledgeas	bazhang	is there a solution then? I need to list CD packages' contents as well
2008-05-05T17:00:00.000Z	bazhang	sledgeas	why do you need to do this
2008-05-05T17:02:00.000Z	sledgeas	bazhang	i am installing a GUN backgammon (http://debian.mirror.inra.fr/debian/pool/main/g/gnubg/gnubg_0.90-2_i386.deb), and i need to know the un/satisfied dependencies. but i may need to install packages offline in the future, too. can you dir me the deps that .deb files i need to fetch for a successfull offline gnubg installation?
2008-05-05T17:02:00.000Z	bazhang	sledgeas	if you go to the site I originally mentioned they have the deps
2008-05-05T17:04:00.000Z	sledgeas	bazhang	i know, that but i don't know which1s exactly, and which ones are already shipped with hardy CD (e.g. libsqllite3-0 (>=3.5.7) and many others)
2008-05-05T17:05:00.000Z	bazhang	sledgeas	that site combined with cat dpkg -l > text.txt would narrow it down a bit
2008-08-18T14:40:00.000Z	bazhang	sledgeas	try one of those ^^
2008-08-18T14:40:00.000Z	sledgeas	bazhang	how come you did not list out reconstructor? :)
2008-08-18T14:40:00.000Z	bazhang	sledgeas	that is from fedora
2008-08-18T16:31:00.000Z	sledgeas	bazhang	!remaster does not contain any nice GUI to work with (reconstructor seemed nice, and it supports 8.04 -- but i have questions about that reconstructor)
2008-08-18T16:31:00.000Z	bazhang	sledgeas	uck does
2008-08-18T16:32:00.000Z	sledgeas	bazhang	I'm working with alternate cd, uck curses on it.. (i cannot use livecd, because i will be ssh'ing onto the installation from my box overseas)
