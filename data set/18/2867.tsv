2010-02-02T23:18:00.000Z	CAPcap		since i know this is off topic i'm just going to ask where to ask about it. i need a small light distro for an ancient computer with tiny amounts of ram and processing power. tiny hard drive. where should i ask about what distro to use?

2010-02-02T23:19:00.000Z	CAPcap	kamada	i have a DSL live cd. i cant figure how to use wifi, or any broadband for that matter
2010-02-02T23:20:00.000Z	kamada	CAPcap	then you probably need to learn more before you can use a lighter distro
2010-02-02T23:22:00.000Z	CAPcap	kamada	biggest issue with the computer is its lovely 500mb HDD lol
2010-02-02T23:23:00.000Z	kamada	CAPcap	wow. retro hardware. even i cant get my distro down that small
2010-02-02T23:23:00.000Z	kamada	CAPcap	what do you want to use it for?
2010-02-02T23:23:00.000Z	CAPcap	kamada	i just wanted to make it live.
2010-02-02T23:23:00.000Z	kamada	CAPcap	do you need X?
2010-02-02T23:24:00.000Z	CAPcap	kamada	i guess...
2010-02-02T23:24:00.000Z	CAPcap	kamada	i do need a GUI so yes
2010-02-02T23:24:00.000Z	kamada	CAPcap	what kinda things you trying to run?
2010-02-02T23:25:00.000Z	CAPcap	kamada	its not essential, mostly i was just curious as to what is out there
2010-02-02T23:35:00.000Z	kamada	CAPcap	wrong, linux is the kernel
2010-02-02T23:36:00.000Z	CAPcap	kamada	hes not gonna know the difference
2010-02-02T23:36:00.000Z	kamada	CAPcap	no point not informing from the beginning tho eh
2010-02-02T23:36:00.000Z	CAPcap	kamada	my point was if he has ubuntu then hes got linux
2010-02-02T23:37:00.000Z	kamada	CAPcap	yeah, but linux isnt ubuntu and vice-versa
