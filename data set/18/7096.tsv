2010-10-22T10:16:00.000Z	icedtea	dkopfman	hola amigo
2010-10-22T10:17:00.000Z	dkopfman		I am a first time user, and I want to install ubuntu 10.10 but my installation hangs, both when I use a live CD and when I use a USB.
2010-10-22T10:17:00.000Z	dkopfman		I've tried fiddling with some of the settings . . .
2010-10-22T10:18:00.000Z	dkopfman		ali - how did you get it to install at all?
2010-10-22T10:18:00.000Z	dkopfman		Well, at first it would give me a purble screen for a moment and then hang with a blank cursor.
2010-10-22T10:18:00.000Z	dkopfman		Then I went into the esc menu
2010-10-22T10:19:00.000Z	dkopfman		and turned off quiet, and set nosplash
2010-10-22T10:20:00.000Z	dkopfman		I got the iso from the website not via bittorrent.
2010-10-22T10:20:00.000Z	dkopfman		And it doesn't seem to work from a USB either.
2010-10-22T10:21:00.000Z	icedtea		did you do a md5sum or whatever it is they use nowadays?
2010-10-22T10:21:00.000Z	dkopfman		It still hung when I set nosplash and -xforcevesa
2010-10-22T10:21:00.000Z	dkopfman		so I went into the F6 menu and clicked all the options, and it got much further . . . it got to the purple screen with the loading dots.  That was exciting . . .
2010-10-22T10:22:00.000Z	dkopfman		but then the loading dots froze.
2010-10-22T10:22:00.000Z	dkopfman	ali_	you are saying it might work if I download it again?
2010-10-22T10:23:00.000Z	dkopfman		I tried to check the package, and that hung too ;)
2010-10-22T10:24:00.000Z	dkopfman		can I use utorrent?
2010-10-22T10:24:00.000Z	icedtea	dkopfman	did you run md5sum on the iso to verify its good?
