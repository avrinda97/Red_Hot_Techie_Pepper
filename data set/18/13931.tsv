2007-07-09T11:35:00.000Z	CarmenSandiego	Anlar	"forensics wouldn't work" is bs? Explain?
2007-07-09T11:36:00.000Z	Anlar	CarmenSandiego	well, deleting something.. it actually either gets overwritten very fast or not etc.. but in principle the data doesn't get instantly overwritten or anything for good. and, if you play with the big boys some further issues raise.
2007-07-09T11:37:00.000Z	Anlar	CarmenSandiego	there's nothing in the design of ext3 that would guarantee overwriting
2007-07-09T11:37:00.000Z	Anlar	CarmenSandiego	just finding the proper data from all that crap and figuring out whether it was overwritten by mistake by some other activities means a lot work
2007-07-09T11:38:00.000Z	CarmenSandiego	Anlar	And I thought linux was supposed to be more secure than Windows... over on that OS I've got a program that overwrites all my free space 35 times with a random Guttmann algorithm, after a couple of mouse clicks
2007-07-09T11:39:00.000Z	Anlar	CarmenSandiego	yes, but the point is.. do you really NEED to do that? the answer is usually no. and it takes resources to do that
2007-07-09T11:39:00.000Z	Anlar	CarmenSandiego	stefg's point is valid. and yes, you can encrypt practically everytthing, especially if youuse usb stick for the actual booting
2007-07-09T11:41:00.000Z	CarmenSandiego	Anlar	encrypting my whole HDD would be a bit of a pain in the ass though... guess that's the way it's got to be. So I'm bleeding my usage history all over my ubuntu partition every time I use it... interesting.
2007-07-09T11:41:00.000Z	Anlar	CarmenSandiego	actually what they don't talk about is that READING data enforces the trait on the platters. you first write random data and then read it, it's even better for getting rid of that ghost image on the disk than writing... faster and more efficient
2007-07-09T11:44:00.000Z	Anlar	CarmenSandiego	it's not that much of work to encrypt really everything, and in really secure way.. but the point indeed is, that practically no one NEEDS that
2007-07-09T11:45:00.000Z	Anlar	CarmenSandiego	windows doesn't really by default encrypt / shred anything either. and building that feature even manually all by yourself isn't hard, to encrypt everything
2007-07-09T11:47:00.000Z	Anlar	CarmenSandiego	if you wish I might have some notes still somewhere on how to build that encryption for ubuntu manually :)
2007-07-09T11:48:00.000Z	CarmenSandiego	Anlar	Thanks, I'll look into it. I've got truecrypt on at the minute, but I don't know if you can set that particular program to automount in the required way
2007-07-09T11:49:00.000Z	Anlar	CarmenSandiego	the alternative you might be interested of goes by the name dm-crypt or md-crypt or something like that :)
2007-07-09T11:50:00.000Z	Anlar	CarmenSandiego	basically the main problem you have is that if you got an os to boot on the hdd, it has to be unencrypted at the beginning.. and handle the keys etc.. that's vulnerable. by moving the first phase of booting the computer to usb stick that you use only for some 10-30s when you boot and remove from the system later, mostly eliminates those problems.. as when unplugged it is completely braindead and invulnerable
2007-07-09T11:53:00.000Z	Anlar	CarmenSandiego	yes. all it has to have really is 1) grub 2) kernel 3) initrd script that finds the hdd parition(s), asks for password, decrypts the actual encryption keys, mounts the partitions, pivot_roots, continues from the now decrypted hdd
2007-07-09T11:53:00.000Z	Anlar	CarmenSandiego	vmware + ubuntu alternate installation disc are your best friends there :)
