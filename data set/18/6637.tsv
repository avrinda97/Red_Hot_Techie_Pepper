2008-04-20T20:53:00.000Z	scotti1	amenado	it's me ubuntu-newb
2008-04-20T20:53:00.000Z	scotti1	amenado	did you look at my pastebin?
2008-04-20T20:55:00.000Z	scotti1	amenado	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/63842/
2008-04-20T20:55:00.000Z	scotti1	amenado	let me ping that, 1 sec
2008-04-20T20:56:00.000Z	scotti1	amenado	yes I pinged 72.14.207.99 and it works
2008-04-20T21:01:00.000Z	scotti1	amenado	should I reset ubuntu back to original default out-of-box network settings? if so, how do I do this, because I thought ever since I tried to mess with the default Roaming mode under Network Manager, and tried to set that ethernet card to DHCP or Static, that I screwed something up. what do you think? Is my Resolv.conf correct? I'm just trying to connect it to the Router, nothing special.
2008-04-20T21:01:00.000Z	scotti1	amenado	no. like I said, that IP address you gave, I was able to ping.
2008-04-20T21:01:00.000Z	scotti1	amenado	but for some reason if I go to Firefox I can't load anything. likewise I cannot ping google.com or yahoo.com
2008-04-20T21:02:00.000Z	scotti1	amenado	do you want me to pastebin me interfaces file?
2008-04-20T21:10:00.000Z	scotti1	amenado	when I typed dig yahoo.com, it just there a second and then says whatever is in this Pastebin http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/63843/
2008-04-20T21:10:00.000Z	scotti1	amenado	it *sat* there a second
2008-04-20T21:11:00.000Z	scotti1	amenado	you said I need to add a domain to search in Resolv.conf? which url should I put?
2008-04-20T21:12:00.000Z	scotti1	amenado	no I don't have my own website domain if that's what you mean. I will try the one you just gave. 1 sec
2008-04-20T21:18:00.000Z	scotti1	amenado	I entered the line "search myhome.sweethome.net" above the "nameserver 192.168.2.1" in Resolve.conf, then I did the networking restart, but it does the same thing. I think you are right about the DNS not resolving...i checked my Linksys router settings. I am using Tomato which is another firmware
2008-04-20T21:20:00.000Z	scotti1	amenado	it uses Static DHCP which means any new computer will be assigned any number thru DHCP, unless you go into the firmware and specify a specific number for that MAC address. so in other words, my ubuntu desktop was already assigned a random IP, since I was able to Ping that google IP....what do I need to do>
2008-04-20T21:27:00.000Z	scotti1	amenado	I mean I never have trouble getting online with all my other computers(which use XP)...do you want me to use the DNS IP addresses that my Cable modem is using?
2008-04-20T21:30:00.000Z	scotti1	amenado	OHH....i sound like a newb. lol
2008-04-20T21:30:00.000Z	scotti1	amenado	thanks a lot, I'll keep trying
