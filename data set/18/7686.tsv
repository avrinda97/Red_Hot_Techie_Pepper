2007-12-26T07:33:00.000Z	buggeredfstab	robdig	I think so. it's the bar on top of the windows with the _ [] X at the end
2007-12-26T07:34:00.000Z	robdig	buggeredfstab	oh, you mean the window title bar...I'll check
2007-12-26T07:35:00.000Z	buggeredfstab	robdig	it looks like I am missing part of the border on my windows.
2007-12-26T07:36:00.000Z	buggeredfstab	robdig	yeah
2007-12-26T07:37:00.000Z	robdig	buggeredfstab	are you using gnome?

2007-12-26T07:40:00.000Z	robdig	buggeredfstab	hmm, that should be ok. have you tried restarting X?
2007-12-26T07:41:00.000Z	buggeredfstab	robdig	I've rebooted several times
2007-12-26T07:42:00.000Z	robdig	buggeredfstab	hmm...
