2009-09-12T21:39:00.000Z	WdnSpoon		I plug in my x-box controller; the xpad module loads, but it controls my mouse cursor and isn't identified as a joystick. How do I get it to recognize it as a joystick instead?
2009-09-12T21:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	WdnSpoon	try jscalibrator
2009-09-12T21:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	WdnSpoon	sudo apt-get install joystick
2009-09-12T21:41:00.000Z	WdnSpoon	ActionParsnip	already installed
2009-09-12T21:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	WdnSpoon	there should be an app in the config app someplace where you can config it
2009-09-12T21:43:00.000Z	WdnSpoon	ActionParsnip	which app is that? ie what should I run to find that
2009-09-12T21:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	WdnSpoon	alt+f2   type jscalibrator
2009-09-12T21:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	WdnSpoon	if it isnt installed run: sudo apt-get install jscalibrator
2009-09-12T21:45:00.000Z	WdnSpoon	ActionParsnip	right I've checked that before; it sees my js0 as the xbox controller, but it doesn't register any input. Moving my axis just moves my mouse cursor
2009-09-12T21:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	WdnSpoon	have you read this: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Xbox360Controller
2009-09-12T21:46:00.000Z	WdnSpoon	ActionParsnip	trying that; the codes not compiling but I'm trying to fudge it a little
2009-09-12T21:48:00.000Z	WdnSpoon	ActionParsnip	I think this may be the answer: the driver is fine, it's X that's grabbing my input: http://www.gs1.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=6267529&posted=1#post6267529
2009-09-12T21:54:00.000Z	WdnSpoon	ActionParsnip	Okay this was the answer: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Joystick_lshal_outputs_done  thanks for your help
2010-05-11T00:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	WdnSpoon	you dont mount drives, you mount partitions ;)
2010-05-11T00:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	WdnSpoon	if you add the partition in /etc/fstab the options you set will be used when it is mounted
2010-05-11T00:25:00.000Z	WdnSpoon	ActionParsnip	 it's a USB drive so the /dev/ name of it changes sometimes.. can I set it to recognize the volume name/something similar instead?
2010-05-11T00:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	WdnSpoon	if you run: sudo blkid   you can get the UUID which never changes
2010-05-11T00:26:00.000Z	WdnSpoon	ActionParsnip	cool that worked. Thanks!
