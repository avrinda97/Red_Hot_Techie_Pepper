2007-01-01T09:00:00.000Z	sukarn		ok, but there does seem to be something wrong here
2007-01-01T09:01:00.000Z	sukarn		hmm... i'll have to check the BIOS, though I never changed any setting related to HDD in the bios, I only changed the display settings
2007-01-01T09:01:00.000Z	sukarn		its a PC that I use in my home
2007-01-01T09:01:00.000Z	LameBMX	sukarn	what kind of PC is this
2007-01-01T09:01:00.000Z	sukarn	LameBMX	assembled
2007-01-01T09:02:00.000Z	sukarn	LameBMX	not myself, a technician did it about 3 months ago
2007-01-01T09:03:00.000Z	sukarn	LameBMX	I have windows installed, but I don't use it. Windows doesn't matter to me.
2007-01-01T09:05:00.000Z	sukarn	LameBMX	Doesn't seem possible. He only checked that the display was on when he assembled the PC
2007-01-01T09:06:00.000Z	sukarn	LameBMX	I really mean it. I found out after bringing the PC home that he had not even connected the HDD to the power supply
2007-01-01T09:06:00.000Z	sukarn	LameBMX	I did that myself though
2007-01-01T09:09:00.000Z	sukarn	LameBMX	and Maheanuu thanks for all this help.
2007-01-01T09:42:00.000Z	LameBMX	sukarn	they are always worth a try
2007-01-01T09:43:00.000Z	LameBMX	sukarn	that should make no difference .. is you set the controller to pata mode you will have them appear to be ide drives .. hda instead of sda
2007-01-01T09:45:00.000Z	LameBMX	sukarn	at the grub boot screen ...
2007-01-01T09:46:00.000Z	LameBMX	sukarn	is this installed or livecd
2007-01-01T09:46:00.000Z	sukarn	LameBMX	which one? the initrd line or the one before that? its installed
2007-01-01T09:47:00.000Z	sukarn	LameBMX	ok, thanks. i'll try that now
2007-01-01T09:47:00.000Z	sukarn	LameBMX	bye
