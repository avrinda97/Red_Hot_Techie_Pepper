2007-12-19T17:40:00.000Z	Myrtti		does anyone use network-manager-pptp to create vpn connection in Ubuntu Gutsy?
2007-12-19T17:40:00.000Z	dadehoog	Myrtti	I have done ...
2007-12-19T17:41:00.000Z	Myrtti	dadehoog	do you remember the plugin or vpn altogether been updated since release of gutsy?
2007-12-19T17:42:00.000Z	dadehoog	Myrtti	sorry ? I only tried it after Gutsy was released, but it all worked at that point ...
2007-12-19T17:42:00.000Z	Myrtti	dadehoog	okay, there seems to be something broken here, all the settings seem to be fine, but the vpn account is grayed out on network-manager when using mobile dialup...
2007-12-19T17:44:00.000Z	dadehoog	Myrtti	I think that's a pretty common issue ...
2007-12-19T17:44:00.000Z	dadehoog	Myrtti	with a simple solution ... but I can't remember it off-hand ...
2007-12-19T17:45:00.000Z	dadehoog	Myrtti	hand on a tick ...
2007-12-19T17:45:00.000Z	Myrtti	dadehoog	seems that the dialup even isn't the only reason
2007-12-19T17:45:00.000Z	Myrtti	dadehoog	sure
2007-12-19T17:47:00.000Z	dadehoog	Myrtti	I just got it working on my laptop - that quickly ... anything in the pptp client FAQ ?
2007-12-19T17:50:00.000Z	dadehoog	Myrtti	is the connection that you're using (over which you want use the pptp tunnel) configured by NetworkManager ?
2007-12-19T17:50:00.000Z	Myrtti	dadehoog	yes
2007-12-19T17:52:00.000Z	dadehoog	Myrtti	have you restarted NetworkManager since configuring the VPN connection ?
2007-12-19T17:53:00.000Z	Myrtti	dadehoog	plenty of times
2007-12-19T17:53:00.000Z	dadehoog	Myrtti	I've found one reference which indicates that use of the ppp0 interface makes it problematic
2007-12-19T17:55:00.000Z	Myrtti	dadehoog	okey, so that's not going to work anyway then, I wonder what's up with the rest of the vpn problems
2007-12-19T17:56:00.000Z	dadehoog	Myrtti	what have your other VPN issues been ?
