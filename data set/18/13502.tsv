2005-11-16T06:15:00.000Z	dirkson		*sighs* I've got a bit of a nasty problem on bootup, it's probably related to one of the options I picked when I recompiled the kernel. Can anyone help me for a couple moments with it?
2005-11-16T06:17:00.000Z	dirkson		*laughs* I would if I could. It's repeating series of error messages on the boot, but I don't know enough to find the bootlog afterwards, so I can't give the exact message
2005-11-16T06:19:00.000Z	dirkson		Yah. First time you guys told it to me, it barfed my connection, but I hardcoded a hack into the kernel, and now my internet connection is rock solid. (Though you don't even want to see what I did to that code. *shudder*) I find the concept of pastebin... curious, and I'm really surprised that you can get most people to use it. Makes sense, though
2005-11-16T06:21:00.000Z	dirkson		True. Didn't see the script, Dooglus, going to take another look now.
2005-11-16T06:21:00.000Z	dirkson		Mustard5, Well, two lines. But there are related lines before it as well, I think.
2005-11-16T06:22:00.000Z	dirkson		Mustard5, Ah, well, thanks anyway. Any chance you could remind me where to find the bootlog, anyway? Useful thing, that.
2005-11-16T06:23:00.000Z	dirkson		The last three days have really pushed my limits. Really hard to remember every little place where Linux keeps stuff.
2005-11-16T06:24:00.000Z	MarcN	dirkson	locate is helpful to find files
2005-11-16T06:25:00.000Z	dirkson	MarcN	well, I'm really not sure what to look for. Is it really just called 'bootlog', or something silly like that?
2005-11-16T06:25:00.000Z	MarcN	dirkson	not sure what you are looking for, but "locate filename" is useful to find filename
2005-11-16T06:26:00.000Z	dirkson		Quite possibly. I was checking in there, but I can look again. It's quite easy to miss things, I think
2005-11-16T06:27:00.000Z	dirkson	MarcN	Basically, I'm just looking for a record of the text that scrolls across my screen when I boot
2005-11-16T06:28:00.000Z	MarcN	dirkson	seems I have a bootlog daemon installed, but not enabled by default.
2005-11-16T06:29:00.000Z	MarcN	dirkson	 need to edit /etc/default/bootlogd to enable it on boot.
2005-11-16T06:29:00.000Z	dirkson		*finds a log buried deep in a subdirectory* Wait a minute, this might be better.........
2005-11-16T06:29:00.000Z	MarcN	dirkson	and looking in /etc/init.d/bootlogd startup script it would seem that /var/log/boot is where it goes.
2005-11-16T06:30:00.000Z	dirkson		Marcn- Ok, cool, that's certainly useful to know
2005-11-16T06:31:00.000Z	MarcN	dirkson	/etc/init.d/ is where startup scripts are, /etc/default/ are frequently configuration files for them.  /var/log/ is where things are logged.
