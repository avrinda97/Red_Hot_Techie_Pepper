2007-06-12T14:44:00.000Z	fogwar		HEY GUYS SORRY FOR CAPS!!!!: What does mount: No medium found mean?
2007-06-12T14:45:00.000Z	nuked_omen	fogwar	what were you trying to do?
2007-06-12T14:45:00.000Z	fogwar	nuked_omen	mounting my external hd
2007-06-12T14:45:00.000Z	nuked_omen	fogwar	how did you try to mount it?
2007-06-12T14:46:00.000Z	fogwar	nuked_omen	i tried two ways. first "mount /dev/sda /drive" then "mount /dev/sda /drive -t ntfs -o umode=0002"
2007-06-12T14:46:00.000Z	nuked_omen	fogwar	how did you know it was in /dev/sda
2007-06-12T14:46:00.000Z	nuked_omen	fogwar	just guessed?
2007-06-12T14:47:00.000Z	fogwar	nuked_omen	well, its where it was before, and im trying to use gparted to find out and it keeps saying searching
2007-06-12T14:48:00.000Z	nuked_omen	fogwar	ok.. type fdisk -l.. try to find the partition that best describes your external hd (most likely of the /dev/sdax) then try mount /dev/sdax /media/hd
2007-06-12T14:48:00.000Z	nuked_omen	fogwar	x is a number
2007-06-12T14:48:00.000Z	fogwar	nuked_omen	yes, i know, but i know its in sda
2007-06-12T14:49:00.000Z	fogwar	nuked_omen	wait a min
2007-06-12T14:49:00.000Z	fogwar	nuked_omen	its not even showing up now... hmm
2007-06-12T14:49:00.000Z	nuked_omen	fogwar	it can't be /dev/sda.. that's just impossible
2007-06-12T14:49:00.000Z	fogwar	nuked_omen	yeahj weell its not showing up now
2007-06-12T14:49:00.000Z	nuked_omen	fogwar	it has to be /dev/sda1 or /dev/sda2
2007-06-12T14:50:00.000Z	nuked_omen	fogwar	did you do fdisk -l ?
