2011-03-13T21:49:00.000Z	needlez	dagni	have you done any updates to the system or could the windows system be compromised and causing an issue for the other side??

2011-03-13T21:51:00.000Z	needlez	dagni	type top and show me what the output is in pastie.org post the pastie.org link here only, and maybe i can see if something is eating up ram causeing the slow down
