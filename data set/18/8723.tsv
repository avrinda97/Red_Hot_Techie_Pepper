2007-09-02T07:13:00.000Z	Shadow6363	nothingssomethin	man split is a command, it opens the man page for split which is something that can split your file
2007-09-02T07:14:00.000Z	Shadow6363	nothingssomethin	thats how i read it first, but then i realized what he was saying
2007-09-02T07:14:00.000Z	Shadow6363	nothingssomethin	yes
2007-09-02T07:19:00.000Z	Shadow6363	nothingssomethin	this is what i normally do man split > ~/Desktop/split.txt
2007-09-02T07:19:00.000Z	Shadow6363	nothingssomethin	that will copy the man page into a txt document on your desktop that you should be able to double click and open in gedit
2007-09-02T07:20:00.000Z	Shadow6363	nothingssomethin	no idea if there is a better way, but thats how i always do it
2007-09-02T07:24:00.000Z	Shadow6363	nothingssomethin	are you just trying to split a file into two parts?
2007-09-02T07:27:00.000Z	Shadow6363	nothingssomethin	sorry, i too am reading the man page
2007-09-02T07:38:00.000Z	Shadow6363	nothingssomethin	fyi, i wont know you said something to me unless you type my whole name but as you suspected, im not sure how you could rejoin the files once in windows
2007-09-02T07:39:00.000Z	Shadow6363	nothingssomethin	what i am thinking is to rar your zip file into a multivolume archive (2) and then store each part on a disc, then in windows, copy them to your hard drive and unrar them to get the zip, then unzip it to get your files
2007-09-02T07:42:00.000Z	nothingssomethin	Shadow6363	does makeing a rar split the file?????
2007-09-02T07:42:00.000Z	Shadow6363	nothingssomethin	no, you have to specify that which is what im trying to figure out
2007-09-02T07:43:00.000Z	nothingssomethin	Shadow6363	i thought rar was just like zip
2007-09-02T07:50:00.000Z	Shadow6363	nothingssomethin	what size does each part need to be?
2007-09-02T07:57:00.000Z	Shadow6363	nothingssomethin	looks like brandon got your answer
