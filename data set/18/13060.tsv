2006-01-17T14:28:00.000Z	ashyg		no root pw? what if someone tries to ssh into your computer as root?
2006-01-17T14:29:00.000Z	ashyg		error processing kernel-headers-2.4.27-2-686_2.4.27-12_i386.deb package architecture (i386) does not match system (amd64)
2006-01-17T14:29:00.000Z	ashyg		:(
2006-01-17T14:29:00.000Z	ashyg		man, i guess i'm not using ubuntu
2006-01-17T14:30:00.000Z	ashyg		until it gets updated to use an up-to-date kernel
2006-01-17T14:30:00.000Z	ashyg		because this is an absolute pain and i've been working on it for 13 hours straight
2006-01-17T14:30:00.000Z	sethk	ashyg	you have to install amd64 headers on an amd64 system
2006-01-17T14:30:00.000Z	sethk	ashyg	it is somewhat involved
2006-01-17T14:30:00.000Z	ashyg	sethk	there are none at packages.ubuntu.com
2006-01-17T14:30:00.000Z	sethk	ashyg	sure there are, I have a 386 system but I see the package in my list
2006-01-17T14:31:00.000Z	ashyg	sethk	i looked through and i don't see any amd64 dapper .deb
2006-01-17T14:31:00.000Z	sethk	ashyg	ok, that's possible, if I use unreleased software I don't bitch about it not being finished
2006-01-17T14:32:00.000Z	ashyg	sethk	then how do i get it running
2006-01-17T14:32:00.000Z	sethk	ashyg	why do you need dapper?  use breezy
2006-01-17T14:32:00.000Z	sethk	ashyg	if you need a 2.4 kernel, don't use ubuntu
2006-01-17T14:33:00.000Z	sethk	ashyg	slackware still ships with a 2.4 kernel, as does one of the debian flavors
2006-01-17T14:33:00.000Z	ashyg	sethk	jesus dude breezy doesn't have the ethernet driver i need
2006-01-17T14:33:00.000Z	sethk	ashyg	sounds like you really aren't a good candidate for ubuntu
