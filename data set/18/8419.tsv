2008-05-03T15:10:00.000Z	cwillu	Flynsarmy	for future reference, alot of people's audio problems (where it half works, but some apps just don't get sound) are related to a current snafu with the flash plugin
2008-05-03T15:11:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	cwillu	I installed the adobe flash nonfree one and youtube now works but some other site instead said 'flash player 8 or above and javascript need to be enabled'. JS was enabled and its flash 9 on here so i'm not sure what the prob was

2009-01-26T17:35:00.000Z	cwillu	Flynsarmy	I think nvidia's going to support xrandr soon'ish, so in another 6 months to a year, we might have a better approach
2009-01-26T17:39:00.000Z	Flynsarmy	cwillu	If i fn+lc and increase res to 1680 then switch back to laptop monitor without resising down first, will it break my laptop?
2009-01-26T17:39:00.000Z	cwillu	Flynsarmy	no, it should just give you a bigger virtual desktop until you resize it
