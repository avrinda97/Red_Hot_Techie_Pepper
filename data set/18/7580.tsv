2010-09-25T06:47:00.000Z	micah	ectospasm	every time I try to recieve a picture from my friend using yahoo messenger it says she has canceled the file sharing when she hasn't
2010-09-25T06:48:00.000Z	ectospasm	micah	yeah, filesharing has always been buggy in the third party clients.  Try posting it an image bin and using that instead.
