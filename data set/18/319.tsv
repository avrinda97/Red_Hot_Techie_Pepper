2012-05-25T03:16:00.000Z	sk1special	subcool	you know if you make any changes in the bios after running the Boot-Repair you have to run it again? ( at least i did ) like changing drive boot order etc etc
2012-05-25T03:17:00.000Z	subcool	sk1special	i havent gotten boot repair to work.

2012-05-25T03:20:00.000Z	subcool		ya, this is kinda easy stuff- but at hte same time ... not- im out of practice.
2012-05-25T03:20:00.000Z	sk1special	subcool	you tried just updating the grub via terminal?
2012-05-25T03:21:00.000Z	subcool	sk1special	i forgot the command,
2012-05-25T03:21:00.000Z	subcool		grub update?
2012-05-25T03:21:00.000Z	sk1special		sudo update-grub
2012-05-25T03:21:00.000Z	sk1special		i believe
2012-05-25T03:22:00.000Z	subcool		   /usr/sbin/grub-probe: error: cannot find a device for / (is /dev mounted?).
2012-05-25T03:23:00.000Z	sk1special		that sounds like something my knowledge is way to shallow to fix atm lol. i will gladly listen to other people tell you how to fix it so i know for the next person tho
