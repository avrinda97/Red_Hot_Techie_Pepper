2005-10-14T15:22:00.000Z	Shunyata		can anyone help me compiling mt-daapd-0.2.3
2005-10-14T15:22:00.000Z	bibe	Shunyata	do you compile that from source or from a debian/ubuntu-packaged source?
2005-10-14T15:23:00.000Z	Shunyata	bibe	: from source
2005-10-14T15:23:00.000Z	Shunyata	bibe	could not find any working package anyway
2005-10-14T15:23:00.000Z	bibe	Shunyata	where did you download the sources?
2005-10-14T15:24:00.000Z	Shunyata	bibe	: from sourceforge
2005-10-14T15:25:00.000Z	Shunyata	bibe	: i must admit i'm quite newbie ... but willing to learn
2005-10-14T15:26:00.000Z	Shunyata	bibe	i tried to look on forums and google but could not find anything
2005-10-14T15:26:00.000Z	bibe	Shunyata	please tell me the URL to the latest sources
2005-10-14T15:31:00.000Z	bibe	Shunyata	just a moment
2005-10-14T15:31:00.000Z	bibe	Shunyata	did you already install build-essential package?
2005-10-14T15:35:00.000Z	bibe	Shunyata	I configured the sources, I am now compiling
2005-10-14T15:35:00.000Z	bibe	Shunyata	you only need build-essential, libgdbm-dev and libid3tag0-dev packages. Please read the configure error messages...
2005-10-14T15:36:00.000Z	Shunyata	bibe	: i'll look for it
2005-10-14T15:36:00.000Z	bibe	Shunyata	you simply need to issue a 'sudo apt-get install build-essential libgdbm-dev libid3tag0-dev
2005-10-14T15:37:00.000Z	bibe	Shunyata	then unpack the sources, cd to the sources dir and './configure && make && sudo make install'
2005-10-14T15:37:00.000Z	Shunyata	bibe	: some stuff was missing
2005-10-14T15:45:00.000Z	Shunyata	bibe	thx a lot libid3dev was missing now i can compile :)
