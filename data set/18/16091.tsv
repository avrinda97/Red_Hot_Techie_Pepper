2004-11-14T15:35:00.000Z	|trey|		(on a side note, mplayer isn't letting me view my pr0n, this is unacceptable  ;)
2004-11-14T15:36:00.000Z	GnuHippy	|trey|	why wont it let you view your pr0n?
2004-11-14T15:36:00.000Z	|trey|	GnuHippy	dunno... just won't run files that worked prior to the last upgrade  :(
2004-11-14T15:38:00.000Z	|trey|	GnuHippy	not really... inkscape is one interface, but nothing has the features of the GIMP
2004-11-14T15:39:00.000Z	|trey|	GnuHippy	I know, but yeah, I was mainly pointing at the single interface for it... nothing beats GIMP for me though, not even Photoshop...

2004-11-14T16:01:00.000Z	|trey|	GnuHippy	I just used Synaptic?
2004-11-14T16:39:00.000Z	|trey|	GnuHippy	I haven't noticed *that* much... which is actually prolly a good thing  :)
2004-11-14T16:41:00.000Z	|trey|	GnuHippy	not even that... its for people that can't think of anything else to waste clock cycles on  ;)
2004-11-14T16:54:00.000Z	|trey|	GnuHippy	umm, working with Server 2k and 2k3   :/
2004-11-14T16:55:00.000Z	|trey|	GnuHippy	merging of AD between those is a pain *nods*
2004-11-14T16:55:00.000Z	|trey|	GnuHippy	ASR?

2004-11-15T17:08:00.000Z	|trey|	GnuHippy	it will be in Hoary probably this weekend, you can't live with Xfree for a few more days?  ;)

2004-11-15T17:10:00.000Z	|trey|	GnuHippy	hah... composite doesn't work yet, so you won't get that anyways  :(
2004-11-19T15:46:00.000Z	|trey|	GnuHippy	no one wants a monolithic xserver though... thats not the direction everyone wants to take  ;)
2004-11-19T15:48:00.000Z	GnuHippy	|trey|	isnt the x.org server that is going to be included in Hoary in the coming days going to be monolithic?
