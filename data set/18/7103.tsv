2008-02-16T00:58:00.000Z	pocketdrummer		Does mplayer stretch the video for anyone else? Or is there something wrong?
2008-02-16T00:59:00.000Z	Jowi	pocketdrummer	only if the vid has got the wrong aspect ratio.
2008-02-16T01:00:00.000Z	Jowi	pocketdrummer	you can try "-zoom yes"
2008-02-16T01:01:00.000Z	Jowi	pocketdrummer	you also have "-aspect 16:9" (or 4:3) and "-monitoraspect 4:3"
2008-02-16T01:01:00.000Z	Jowi	pocketdrummer	on the command line
2008-02-16T01:04:00.000Z	Jowi	pocketdrummer	are you using gmplayer (or mplayer-gui as it is sometimes called) or mplayer?
2008-02-16T01:08:00.000Z	Jowi	pocketdrummer	you have a lot of options to chose from. if you use "mplayer -zoom -fs filename.avi" does it scale correctly?
2008-02-16T01:15:00.000Z	pocketdrummer	Jowi	It looks the same I think. This is what it says when I run that, "Movie-Aspect is 1.19:1 - prescaling to correct movie aspect.
2008-02-16T01:15:00.000Z	Jowi	pocketdrummer	how about "mplayer -zoom -aspect 4:3 filename"
2008-02-16T01:17:00.000Z	pocketdrummer	Jowi	wow, that's actually stretched more... That doesn't make sense...
2008-02-16T01:17:00.000Z	Jowi	pocketdrummer	how about "mplayer -zoom -aspect 16:9 filename"
2008-02-16T01:18:00.000Z	pocketdrummer	Jowi	REALLY stretched.
2008-02-16T01:19:00.000Z	Jowi	pocketdrummer	ok, so the vid you are trying to watch is a bit strange.
2008-02-16T01:20:00.000Z	pocketdrummer	Jowi	It says it's 320x240 (codec: mpeg-1)
2008-02-16T01:23:00.000Z	Jowi	pocketdrummer	1.19:1 is called "movietone" apparently. 35mm used in late 1920-1930.
2008-02-16T01:24:00.000Z	Jowi	pocketdrummer	try "mplayer -zoom -aspect 1.19:1 filename"
2008-02-16T01:26:00.000Z	pocketdrummer	Jowi	it says, "Error parsing option on the command line: -aspect"
2008-02-16T01:26:00.000Z	Jowi	pocketdrummer	should work. it works here. "mplayer -zoom -aspect 1.19:1 filename.avi"
