2007-09-29T08:12:00.000Z	Lifeisfunny		that "help" entry on the ubuntu feisty starter guide for firestarter is bogus
2007-09-29T08:14:00.000Z	Lifeisfunny		pelo, yeah, pretty much a nube with linux
2007-09-29T08:14:00.000Z	Lifeisfunny		I did some scanns and found ports set at closed, I'd like them stealthed
2007-09-29T08:16:00.000Z	Lifeisfunny		pelo, how hacker safe is it when set to closed?
2007-09-29T08:17:00.000Z	nickrud	Lifeisfunny	if it's closed, that means nothing can talk to it. In fact
2007-11-17T02:11:00.000Z	nickrud	Lifeisfunny	see topic
2007-11-17T02:12:00.000Z	Lifeisfunny	nickrud	ok
2007-11-17T02:12:00.000Z	nickrud	Lifeisfunny	but with aptitude interactive, you can fix the dependency problems
2007-11-17T02:13:00.000Z	Lifeisfunny	nickrud	could you give me some info like what is samba?
2007-11-17T02:13:00.000Z	nickrud	Lifeisfunny	basically a way to see windows shares
2007-11-17T02:14:00.000Z	Lifeisfunny	nickrud	ok thanks.  I don't need it actually since I don't have a windows os
2007-11-17T02:15:00.000Z	nickrud	Lifeisfunny	ah, you are intellectually advanced, then
2007-11-17T02:15:00.000Z	Lifeisfunny	nickrud	hahaha, not really just want to get away from what seems to be a permanent drain in the wallet.
2008-01-20T04:16:00.000Z	nickrud	Lifeisfunny	where are you trying to start firestarter from?
2008-01-20T04:17:00.000Z	Lifeisfunny	nickrud	the terminal, it doesn't come up from the gui
2008-01-20T04:17:00.000Z	nickrud	Lifeisfunny	I mean, a console or a terminal on the desktop
2008-01-20T04:17:00.000Z	nickrud	Lifeisfunny	is any other gksudo gui working, like gksudo gedit ?
2008-01-20T04:19:00.000Z	nickrud	Lifeisfunny	strange, usually that error carries over to all gui apps
