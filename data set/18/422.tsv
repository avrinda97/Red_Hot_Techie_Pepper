2012-02-24T18:51:00.000Z	mi3		can anyone suggest me?
2012-02-24T18:52:00.000Z	escott	mi3	you can grab the debs from /var/cache/apt/archives/
2012-02-24T18:54:00.000Z	mi3	escott	there are a lot of deb files, how do I backup them?
2012-02-24T18:55:00.000Z	escott	mi3	how were you planning to get files to the offline machine?
2012-02-24T18:57:00.000Z	mi3	escott	,by a flash drive, u know , with those updates copied to a flash drive and then moved to the offline pc
2012-02-24T18:58:00.000Z	escott	mi3	if the machines are identical and the flash drive is large enough you could rsync -delete from the /var/cache/apt/archives/ on a regular basis. that would be the easiest way to get updates over
2012-02-24T18:58:00.000Z	escott	mi3	although you would also need to copy the updated apt dependency lists
2012-02-24T19:00:00.000Z	mi3	escott	tell me all the steps i am a newbie dude never tried that before, 1st how to backup them? i know the folder and i copied them, nut there is a lock icon on those deb files
2012-02-24T19:03:00.000Z	escott	mi3	i've never done this so I can't give you all the steps. all i can say is that apt needs a list of the files to install and their checksums and then will look into /var/cache/apt/ to see if the files were already downloaded. so what you need to get over to the other machine is the *.deb files and the updated package archive list. and you would put those in /apt. alternately if you can get a bigger disk to do the transfer you could tr
2012-02-24T19:05:00.000Z	escott	mi3	not that i am aware of
2012-02-24T19:07:00.000Z	escott	mi3	its a lot of sneaker work to shuffle files back and forth. is there a way to make this an online machine?
2012-02-24T19:12:00.000Z	escott	mi3	its hard to work with hypotheticals. hypothetically if the US and russia launch their nukes canonical won't be producing many updates so i wouldn't worry
2012-02-24T19:12:00.000Z	mi3	escott	hehehehehehe
2012-02-24T19:13:00.000Z	mi3	escott	hey atleast in modern warfare 3 they did[hypothetically]
2012-02-24T19:24:00.000Z	mi3	escott	thanks for the advices!!
2012-05-13T08:10:00.000Z	escott	mi3	mint?
