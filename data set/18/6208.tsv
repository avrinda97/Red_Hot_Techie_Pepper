2008-06-08T04:48:00.000Z	Ours		cd home/user/this directory
2008-06-08T04:49:00.000Z	Ours		I stick with VmWare
2008-06-08T04:51:00.000Z	Ours		http://img183.imageshack.us/img183/5903/screenshotcy3.png there you go
2008-06-08T04:52:00.000Z	Ours		I'm assuming that the NTFS should be at 68, as should extended?
2008-06-08T04:53:00.000Z	Ours		Now I don't know if I should delete anything, or just resize them
2008-06-08T04:53:00.000Z	Ours		I want to give half the drive to Vista, and the other half to Ubuntu, and that's not exactly broken up evenly
2008-06-08T04:54:00.000Z	Ours		So I don't know which one to shorten
2008-06-08T04:54:00.000Z	Ours		sudo apt-get install?
2008-06-08T04:56:00.000Z	Ours		Hmm, all right, thank you musikgoat  and soundray alike.  I guess I do some deleting and come back if I run into further problems
2008-06-08T04:57:00.000Z	Ours		Though how do I delete them because it has a lock, it's not allowing me to click delete
2008-06-08T04:58:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Ours	what are you trying to delete?
2008-06-08T04:58:00.000Z	Ours		sda3 partition, which includes extened, ext3, and linux-swap
2008-06-08T04:58:00.000Z	Ours		And extended along with the swap have a lock next to them, which is why I'm assuming it's not lettimg me
2008-06-08T04:59:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Ours	its likely in use... do it from a Live CD, or rom Gparted Live
2008-06-08T04:59:00.000Z	Ours	IndyGunFreak	I am doing it from the Live CD
2008-06-08T04:59:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak		hmm, weird.
2008-06-08T04:59:00.000Z	Ours		That's how I got into GParted in the first place :/
2008-06-08T05:00:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Ours	don't know, i don't use the live CD's for partitioning, i use Parted Magic's Live CD
