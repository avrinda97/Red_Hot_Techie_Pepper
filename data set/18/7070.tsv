2008-02-12T05:21:00.000Z	julz		Whenever I start Terminal, it logs me out... Does anyone know why? I have tried reinstalling to no avail
2008-02-12T05:21:00.000Z	hsuh	julz	check your .bashrc or .zshrc or something like that
2008-02-12T05:21:00.000Z	hsuh	julz	maybe temporarly rename it
2008-02-12T05:22:00.000Z	hsuh		or not.. i dunno. i'd do that.
2008-02-12T05:22:00.000Z	julz	hsuh	where are these located? sorry im still learning all this
2008-02-12T05:23:00.000Z	hsuh	julz	on your home. but if you haven't messed with those already forget about it
2008-02-12T05:24:00.000Z	julz	hsuh	ohk well i havent touched them yet. This problem has been here since i installed gutsy, i've managed without it tillnow though
2008-02-12T05:25:00.000Z	hsuh	julz	try xterm for now :P
2008-02-12T05:25:00.000Z	julz	hsuh	i install that through synaptic? and will it just be under applications?
2008-02-12T05:26:00.000Z	hsuh		xterm just "exists". try to run from somewhere.. type xterm and be happy
2008-02-12T05:28:00.000Z	julz	hsuh	but where do i tytpe it? I can't open terminal to type it!
2008-02-12T05:29:00.000Z	hsuh	julz	isn't there a shortcut that opens a box you can call a command?
2008-02-12T05:31:00.000Z	julz	hsuh	do you mean Applications-->Acessories-->Terminal/XTerm?   That is the terminal I cannot get to work! :)

2008-02-12T05:31:00.000Z	hsuh		create a launcher for a command named xterm
