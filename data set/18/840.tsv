2012-04-18T14:13:00.000Z	jonkristian		Hi guys, I'm running ubuntu on my fathers laptop, compiz keeps segfaulting everytime he tries to swtich windows, he has a radeon hd 5400 series card, suggestions? I am not too familiar with ubuntu, what drivers are recommended, can I switch off this compiz thing or is it heavily incorporated in gnome/unity?
2012-04-18T14:14:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	jonkristian	 do you want to use Unity?
2012-04-18T14:15:00.000Z	jonkristian	MonkeyDust	well I want him to have a system that is easy to use and doesn't crash. My mother also use ubuntu on her laptop so they should have the same identical layout.
2012-04-18T14:16:00.000Z	jonkristian	MonkeyDust	okay. But I want to try switching drivers first, do you have a suggestion for that, for the radeon?
2012-04-18T14:16:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	jonkristian	 I use Ubuntu Classic myself, looks very much like Gnome2 and is very fast, XFCE and LXDE are also very fast
2012-04-18T14:17:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	jonkristian	 mmm no
2012-04-18T14:17:00.000Z	jonkristian	MonkeyDust	Thing is, my parents aren't too computer savvy, they are pretty used to the defaults.
2012-04-18T14:18:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	jonkristian	 "defaults" = gnome 2 ?
2012-04-18T14:18:00.000Z	jonkristian	MonkeyDust	no, the unity
2012-04-18T14:19:00.000Z	jonkristian	MonkeyDust	I'll see if i can switch drivers, if not I will try default gnome 3
2012-04-18T14:19:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	jonkristian	 Unity = gnome3
2012-04-18T14:19:00.000Z	jonkristian	MonkeyDust	yes, but with modifications, am i wrong?
2012-04-18T14:19:00.000Z	jonkristian	MonkeyDust	and it doesn't rely on compiz?
2012-04-18T14:19:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	jonkristian	 it does
2012-04-18T14:20:00.000Z	jonkristian	MonkeyDust	I'm running gnome 3 on arch linux here, it doesn't rely on compiz at all.
2012-04-18T14:22:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	jonkristian	 yeah, like I said: Unity = gnome3 + some eye candy
2012-04-18T14:22:00.000Z	jonkristian	MonkeyDust	hmm, just ran unity --reset , it seems that it doesn't crash any longer. What exactly does it do?
2012-04-18T14:23:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	jonkristian	 i guess it resets compiz to defaults, glad you found it :)
