2005-05-15T06:14:00.000Z	Gandalf_SX1	ArdieM	are you sure?? http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=23592
2005-05-15T06:15:00.000Z	Gandalf_SX1	ArdieM	take a look to that topic
2005-05-15T06:19:00.000Z	Gandalf_SX1	ArdieM	yes ubuntuguide.org
2005-05-15T06:23:00.000Z	Gandalf_SX1	ArdieM	yes sudo apt-get unrar-nonfree
2005-05-15T06:23:00.000Z	ArdieM	Gandalf_SX1	i did that but it doesnt work... i have to unpack via console
2005-05-15T06:24:00.000Z	Gandalf_SX1	ArdieM	it always worked for me, i "sudo apt-get install unrar-nonfree rar" and it worked except for rar archoive with password
2005-05-15T06:24:00.000Z	Gandalf_SX1	ArdieM	for that reason i installed WINRAR using XOVER
