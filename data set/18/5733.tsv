2009-03-28T14:38:00.000Z	aprilhare		its not in the repos.
2009-03-28T14:39:00.000Z	aprilhare		hardcoded dependency
2009-03-28T14:39:00.000Z	ikonia	aprilhare	install the right version
2009-03-28T14:36:00.000Z	ikonia	aprilhare	if python 3.0 is in the repo - then that will meet the dependices
2009-03-28T14:37:00.000Z	aprilhare	ikonia	it seems to demand 2.6 (ask the author why). i just got traceback from the app looking for the file /usr/lib/python2.6/threading.py
2009-03-28T14:37:00.000Z	ikonia	aprilhare	ok, so it wants a specific version
2009-03-28T14:38:00.000Z	aprilhare	ikonia	how do i do this? :)
2009-03-28T14:38:00.000Z	ikonia	aprilhare	then I suggest you talk to the author to find out if it is a true hardcoded dependency or if it was just a mistake to request that specific file
2009-03-28T14:38:00.000Z	aprilhare	ikonia	from what hes said, yes it is
2009-03-28T14:38:00.000Z	ikonia	aprilhare	it is what ?
2009-03-28T14:39:00.000Z	ikonia	aprilhare	so you need that specific version then
2009-03-28T14:39:00.000Z	aprilhare	ikonia	back to the question: how do i satisfy this silly dependency? :)
2009-03-28T14:42:00.000Z	aprilhare	ikonia	how do i get and install python 2.6 then? its not in the repositories :)
2009-03-28T14:42:00.000Z	ikonia	aprilhare	check crdlb's comment
2010-10-24T15:27:00.000Z	aprilhare	ikonia	network working now. but "sudo: ipconfig: command not found"
2010-10-24T15:27:00.000Z	aprilhare	ikonia	strangeness
2010-10-24T15:27:00.000Z	ikonia	aprilhare	"ifconfig"
2010-10-24T15:28:00.000Z	ikonia	aprilhare	next time it stops working, we'll work it through more
