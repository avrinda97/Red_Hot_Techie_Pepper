2010-10-12T16:09:00.000Z	Brandon123456		When will I need the code for my encrypted home folder?
2010-10-12T16:09:00.000Z	histo	Brandon123456	if you lose your account or password and need to mount it.
2010-10-12T16:10:00.000Z	Brandon123456	histo	 elaborate plz
2010-10-12T16:10:00.000Z	histo	Brandon123456	I can't thats the only time you will need it.
2010-10-12T16:10:00.000Z	Brandon123456	histo	 and how can I retrieve the code?
2010-10-12T16:12:00.000Z	histo	Brandon123456	you can
2010-10-12T16:12:00.000Z	histo	Brandon123456	you can't
2010-10-12T16:12:00.000Z	Brandon123456	histo	 dang
2010-10-12T16:12:00.000Z	histo	Brandon123456	why did you lose it?
2010-10-12T16:13:00.000Z	Brandon123456	histo	 it got lost somehow, I had my nephew over yesterday
2010-10-12T16:14:00.000Z	histo	Brandon123456	well then I would backup your files in /home/<username> just incase you are unable to mount it.
2010-10-12T16:14:00.000Z	Brandon123456	histo	 I only have 1 account on my machine, and it's under /home/username obvy :P
2010-10-12T16:15:00.000Z	histo	Brandon123456	well then I would backup your files since you no longer have the code.
2010-10-12T16:15:00.000Z	histo	Brandon123456	that way if something back happens you will still have your data.
2010-10-12T16:15:00.000Z	Brandon123456	histo	 oh so the code was in case I couldn't access my home folder anymore?
2010-10-12T16:16:00.000Z	histo	Brandon123456	yes.
2010-10-12T16:17:00.000Z	Brandon123456	histo	 so hypothetically speaking, I'd create a new account or log in as root or whatever, then try to access the lost home folder of the messed up account, then enter that code to access it?
2010-10-12T16:17:00.000Z	histo	Brandon123456	correct
