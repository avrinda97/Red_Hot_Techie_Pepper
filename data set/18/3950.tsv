2009-12-05T02:31:00.000Z	simba_		how can i list what programs is using what ports?
2009-12-05T02:32:00.000Z	h4f	simba_	netstat -ap
2009-12-05T02:32:00.000Z	simba_		thanx
2009-12-05T02:32:00.000Z	h4f	simba_	 iftop looks cool
2009-12-05T02:38:00.000Z	simba_		i have port 58080 open and i dont know why....it is just listed as python
2009-12-05T02:40:00.000Z	h4f	simba_	but is connected to localhost ?
2009-12-05T02:44:00.000Z	simba_	h4f	it showed up in nmap, wich is why i found it....netstat say: tcp        0      0 localhost:58080  *:* LISTEN 7066/beam.smp tcp        1      0 localhost:52817         localhost:58080         CLOSE_WAIT  6943/python
2009-12-05T02:45:00.000Z	h4f	simba_	so you have pid =7066 beam.smp and pid=6943 python . look for what they are
2009-12-05T02:45:00.000Z	h4f	simba_	most probably its something like network applet or any of this
2009-12-05T02:47:00.000Z	simba_	h4f	if i connect with web browser on that port i get htaccess but none of the users and passes i can think of work'
2009-12-05T02:49:00.000Z	h4f	simba_	when I am connecting to beam.smp it asks me for a pass
2009-12-05T02:50:00.000Z	simba_	h4f	simba     7075  0.0  0.0   1528   376 ?        Ss   07:49   0:00 heart -pid 7066 -ht 11; and ubuntu one on 6943
2009-12-05T02:50:00.000Z	h4f		any one know what's beam.smp process for ?
2009-12-05T02:53:00.000Z	simba_	h4f	i guess if you have it to, it's no need for to much paranoya :P
2009-12-05T02:54:00.000Z	h4f	simba_	beam.smp is for couchdb which is some how relates to apache
2009-12-05T02:54:00.000Z	simba_	h4f	ahh...thats all ubuntu1
2009-12-05T02:54:00.000Z	h4f	simba_	the problem now is that when connecting on that ports is asking me for a pass which I have no idea of
2009-12-05T02:56:00.000Z	simba_	h4f	^workman^, thanx
