2010-05-21T00:33:00.000Z	[AWE]		Hi there
2010-05-21T00:33:00.000Z	[AWE]		This is probably an uber noob question but hey I'm an uber noob
2010-05-21T00:33:00.000Z	[AWE]		I just created a /var/web directory
2010-05-21T00:34:00.000Z	[AWE]		how do I give write permissions to my user 'administrator'?
2010-05-21T00:35:00.000Z	guntbert	[AWE]	there is #ubuntu-server too
2010-05-27T01:24:00.000Z	guntbert	[AWE]	all log go to /var/log/
2010-05-27T01:29:00.000Z	guntbert	[AWE]	but to remove some file is not the best thing you could do -- take care
2010-05-27T01:30:00.000Z	[AWE]	guntbert	well I'm stuck
2010-05-27T01:30:00.000Z	[AWE]	guntbert	I can't even access the damn thing with ssh anymore
2010-05-27T01:31:00.000Z	[AWE]	guntbert	all I know is that it was working fine before mod_vhost_alias
2010-05-27T01:31:00.000Z	guntbert	[AWE]	is it a remote machine? what happened?
2010-05-27T01:31:00.000Z	guntbert	[AWE]	are you talking about an apache module?
2010-05-27T01:32:00.000Z	[AWE]	guntbert	it's a VM running in MacOSX
2010-05-27T01:32:00.000Z	[AWE]	guntbert	yes I'm talking about the apache2 module
2010-05-27T01:32:00.000Z	[AWE]	guntbert	and like an idiot I didn't backup the VM before poking around
2010-05-27T01:33:00.000Z	guntbert	[AWE]	ah - thats something completey different -- apache logs are in /var/log/apache2
2010-05-27T01:34:00.000Z	[AWE]	guntbert	yeah I know but the failure is at boot
2010-05-27T01:35:00.000Z	guntbert	[AWE]	my crystal ball says: not related :-)  -- serious: apache modules are loaded at a stage where the basic boot process is long finished
