2010-11-09T03:11:00.000Z	Yerushalmi		Hey folks. I'm having trouble getting Ubuntu to play videos; I have an mp4, for instance, that no matter whether I open it with Movie Player, GNOME MPlayer, or Firefox, it opens the file and then closes it immediately again without playing it.
2010-11-09T03:13:00.000Z	Tweedle	Yerushalmi	mp4 is video too.
2010-11-09T03:13:00.000Z	Yerushalmi	Tweedle	*nod* I know, I've played the video on a Windows machine before. What do I do to get it to play here?
2010-11-09T03:13:00.000Z	Tweedle	Yerushalmi	try running the player from the terminal, so u can see the error
2010-11-09T03:14:00.000Z	Yerushalmi	Tweedle	Okay. What's the command? I'm not used to terminal much
2010-11-09T03:16:00.000Z	Tweedle	Yerushalmi	 it's: mplayer <filename.mp4>
2010-11-09T03:17:00.000Z	Tweedle	Yerushalmi	try getting vlc
2010-11-09T03:18:00.000Z	Tweedle	Yerushalmi	download vlc
2010-11-09T03:18:00.000Z	Yerushalmi	Tweedle	*nod* Doing so.
2010-11-09T03:24:00.000Z	Tweedle	Yerushalmi	did u get it working?
2010-11-09T03:36:00.000Z	Yerushalmi	Tweedle	I don't seem to be able to open VLC
2010-11-09T03:37:00.000Z	Yerushalmi	Tweedle	I installed it fine, but when I click on its icon or right-click on the video and "open with", nothing happens
2010-11-09T03:38:00.000Z	Yerushalmi	Tweedle	And typing into Terminal "vlc <filename>" gives me two lines of output: VLC media player 1.0.6 Goldeneye, and then Segmentation fault.
2010-11-09T03:41:00.000Z	Tweedle	Yerushalmi	did u install ALL dependencies?
2010-11-09T03:42:00.000Z	Tweedle	Yerushalmi	use the synaptic package manager to install VLC
2010-11-09T03:42:00.000Z	Yerushalmi	Tweedle	Okay
2010-11-09T03:42:00.000Z	Tweedle	Yerushalmi	then do a search for mp4 in the pkg manager, and look for things that might help, like codecs etc.
2010-11-09T03:54:00.000Z	Yerushalmi	Tweedle	trojan_spike, any ideas?
