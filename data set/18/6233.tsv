2009-01-07T02:21:00.000Z	jthomas		does anyone know how to get around a server which cannot install 8.04.01 Server?  I am getting an error after hanging at, "Retrieving binutils-static-udeb    2%" and I've found the bug report but no fixes.  I need 8.04 for a client's project.
2009-01-07T02:22:00.000Z	ASULutzy	jthomas	Was it the bug report that was linked earlier? The fixes I saw involved plugging in a different cd-rom drive and using that to install Ubuntu to the server
2009-01-07T02:22:00.000Z	jthomas		KTorrent is great IMHO, but I liked Deluge when I used it a few times
2009-01-07T02:22:00.000Z	jthomas	ASULutzy	yeah that was it :(  The server is in a rack and no easy access, and I don't know if we have a PCI card or if it has an available slot.
2009-01-07T02:23:00.000Z	ASULutzy	jthomas	If you don't have any sort of physical access that's not really any fun, you could maybe make a bootable USB pen drive and install from there
2009-01-07T02:23:00.000Z	jthomas		i checked, it won't boot from a USB
2009-01-07T02:23:00.000Z	jthomas	ASULutzy	do you know of a bootable CD that will pass the boot to the usb?
2009-01-07T02:23:00.000Z	ASULutzy	jthomas	Here at $WORK we do some custom SNMP solutions, and we use customized Ubuntu USB sticks to image the appliances
2009-01-07T02:24:00.000Z	ASULutzy	jthomas	Hmmm, I don't know, that's a bit tricky... Maybe you could get some sort of a network boot going? It's a tricky problem... Have you tried joining #ubuntu-server ?
2009-01-07T02:25:00.000Z	jthomas	ASULutzy	I looked into that also but a network boot looks to be a headache and its not wired to our internal network currently...
2009-01-07T02:25:00.000Z	jthomas		thanks I'll ask there
2009-01-07T02:25:00.000Z	ASULutzy	jthomas	Sometimes the folks in there are better at helping with these sorts of problems, the really tricky ones here seemed to get drowned out by the constant barrage of wireless/video/audio/p2p questions ;)
2009-01-07T02:25:00.000Z	ASULutzy		!patience | rito
2009-01-07T02:25:00.000Z	jthomas	ASULutzy	in that bug report someone mentioned it working with 'the mini iso' -- do you know what that is?
2009-01-07T02:26:00.000Z	ASULutzy	jthomas	You could use like, damn small linux, and try to get that booted. Then once you have that booted you could compile/install unetbootin and install Ubuntu via that
2009-01-07T02:26:00.000Z	ASULutzy	jthomas	That sounds sufficiently tricky ;)
2009-01-07T02:27:00.000Z	jthomas		yeah i like that ;)
2009-01-07T02:27:00.000Z	ASULutzy	jthomas	heh, good luck!
