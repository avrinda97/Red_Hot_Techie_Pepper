2009-03-05T00:42:00.000Z	bertrand		I'm looking for a way to lock my own computer... for me, seriously. I mean, I spend too much time on it while I am supposed to prepare exams. The first thing I would like to do is to allow the access to the computer only for something like one hour a day. The second think I would like (but I can do without) is to be able to use amarok anyway (and only amarok)... Any, idea ?

2009-03-05T00:43:00.000Z	bertrand	nanotube	with is it ?
2009-03-05T00:43:00.000Z	nanotube	bertrand	it was a joke :)
2009-03-05T00:44:00.000Z	bertrand	nanotube	I guessed
2009-03-05T00:44:00.000Z	nanotube	bertrand	easiest thing to do is just turn off the comp after an hour. other than that... have someone else you trust change the user password, then lock screen.
2009-03-05T00:45:00.000Z	nanotube	bertrand	there's no tool out there that will actually prevent you from using the computer - it may lock screen, it may suggest a break, etc - but at the end of they day they all allow an override.
2009-03-05T00:46:00.000Z	nanotube	bertrand	another easy thing to do: pull the network cable. once there's no internet, the computer becomes a lot less fun. :)
2009-03-05T00:46:00.000Z	bertrand	nanotube	I'm alone in the apartment... Maybe I should change the password with the eyes closed, or destroy the computer...
2009-03-05T00:47:00.000Z	nanotube	bertrand	or turn it off. another good option.
2009-03-05T00:47:00.000Z	bertrand	nanotube	already tried, but it is too easy to put the connection back
2009-03-05T00:47:00.000Z	nanotube	bertrand	turn it off, then put in a sleep script to make the boot time really long (well, like 15 minutes), so that turning it back on is not too "easy" :)
2009-03-05T00:49:00.000Z	bertrand	nanotube	Wayder : so, what is for you the best way to make the computer very annoying to use ?
2009-03-05T00:51:00.000Z	nanotube	bertrand	well, to be honest, i try to make my computer /least/ annoying to use. :)
2009-03-05T00:51:00.000Z	nanotube	bertrand	but Wayder's way of "sitting in front of it for 12 hours" tends to work :)
2009-03-05T00:52:00.000Z	bertrand	nanotube	yeah, but I am supposed to work
2009-03-05T00:53:00.000Z	nanotube	bertrand	just buck up and grow a pair - if you need to work, turn off the screen and/or the comp, and work. :)
2009-03-05T00:53:00.000Z	nanotube	bertrand	the old-fashioned method.
