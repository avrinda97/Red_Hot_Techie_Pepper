2007-06-25T16:12:00.000Z	SJrX		lets you save in HTML
2007-06-25T16:13:00.000Z	SJrX	speedo_	I think you might have more luck asking in #html or #php or something
2007-06-25T16:13:00.000Z	speedo_	SJrX	download nvu
2007-06-25T16:13:00.000Z	speedo_		thanks for your input guys

2007-06-25T16:13:00.000Z	SJrX		I prefer editing the HTML manually
2007-06-25T16:14:00.000Z	SJrX		and having someone else make it look good :P
