2012-06-18T04:45:00.000Z	Flavaln		When partitioning to install, should I use an EFIboot partition or just an EXT4 /boot partition?
2012-06-18T04:46:00.000Z	matreya6	Flavaln	what kind of system are you setting up, a Mac or a PC?
2012-06-18T04:47:00.000Z	matreya6	Flavaln	do you want to use an old Windows(prior to Vista) / or even DOS?
2012-06-18T04:52:00.000Z	matreya6	Flavaln	in that case definitely go with BIOS, partition table: msdos.
2012-06-18T04:55:00.000Z	matreya6	Flavaln	yes, you might run out of memory
2012-06-18T04:56:00.000Z	Flavaln	matreya6	that's true even with swap ;-) I think I have plenty of RAM
2012-06-18T05:02:00.000Z	Flavaln	matreya6	I'm doing something similar to you right now except that I am using encryption. I think you need an ext2 /boot partition, and a physical partition for LVM. Then create groups, etc inside the LVM and make one of them /
2012-06-18T05:04:00.000Z	matreya6	Flavaln	My LVM Group "Ubuntu1204"  encompasses my /home, /, swap and /opt, my /boot is 128MB and my / is 240 GB, should be big enough, no?
2012-06-18T05:04:00.000Z	Flavaln	matreya6	so /boot isn't on LVM I assume. Ubuntu installer likes 256 MB for /boot, so maybe that's better. 128 should be enough though.
2012-06-18T05:06:00.000Z	matreya6	Flavaln	I' ll try increasing it to 256MB to see if that works
2012-06-18T06:23:00.000Z	Flavaln	matreya6	bleh I gave up on RAID a decade ago. It really costs a lot more to gain reliability and performance, sometimes the cards and software mess things up, and SSDs are quite quick these days.
2012-06-18T06:26:00.000Z	Flavaln	matreya6	well again RAID won't really do that. It protects against some hardware failure, but leaves you vulnerable to other hardware failures.
2012-06-18T06:27:00.000Z	matreya6	Flavaln	yes, that's partially true, but on top of that I make regular backups to an external disk, which is only attached to the system during making/ restoring backups
2012-06-18T06:28:00.000Z	Flavaln	matreya6	sure if you go really high end RAID starts to make sense, after other solutions are in place.
2012-06-18T06:30:00.000Z	Flavaln	matreya6	yw
2012-06-18T06:34:00.000Z	matreya6	Flavaln	escott, the motherboard manufacturers should receive a major slap on the wrist for calling their on-a-chip solution RAID. As I understand it know, it's a bit similar to the difference between a real modem and a soft/winmodem.
2012-06-18T06:43:00.000Z	Flavaln	matreya6	it wouldn't have a lost&found and shouldn't show as ext4 if it was encrypted
2012-06-18T06:44:00.000Z	matreya6	Flavaln	not with LUKS no, but with ecryptfs it would.
