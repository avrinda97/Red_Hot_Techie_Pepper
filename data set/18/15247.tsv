2005-05-19T13:36:00.000Z	Cybermagellan		hey what do you guys think of this for a Ubuntu webserver logo http://68.231.152.140:8080/apache2-default/poweredby.png ?
2005-05-19T13:36:00.000Z	Seveas	Cybermagellan	not bad, but the font looks fuzzy
2005-05-19T13:59:00.000Z	Cybermagellan	Seveas	something like http://68.231.152.140:8080/apache2-default/poweredby1.png
2005-05-19T14:00:00.000Z	Seveas	Cybermagellan	indeed, but the font is awfully small compared to the logo size imho
2005-05-19T14:01:00.000Z	Seveas	Cybermagellan	i suggest you shrink the logo a bit then
2005-05-19T14:10:00.000Z	Cybermagellan	Seveas	so maybe something like this? http://68.231.152.140:8080/apache2-default/poweredby2.png
2005-05-19T14:11:00.000Z	Seveas	Cybermagellan	comes close, but if you want to put it at the bottom of a page, you should use the previous image with the logo as big as in this image, so that the images width is bigger than its height
2005-05-19T14:12:00.000Z	Cybermagellan	Seveas	ok so kinda like a banner then
2005-05-19T14:13:00.000Z	Seveas	Cybermagellan	yeah, sort of
2005-05-19T14:14:00.000Z	Seveas	Cybermagellan	that's the best one so far :)
2005-07-01T15:21:00.000Z	Seveas	Cybermagellan	just make sure the myhostname and myorigin (aka the contents of /etc/mailname) are correctly set to your domain name
2005-07-01T15:23:00.000Z	Seveas	Cybermagellan	want an example?
2005-07-01T15:24:00.000Z	Seveas	Cybermagellan	http://paste.ubuntulinux.nl/192 , that's for my server: virtualschoolllab.nl
2005-07-01T15:26:00.000Z	Cybermagellan	Seveas	now I own a domain...but a hoster has the DNS for it....that wouldn't let me use that domain on this box would it?
2005-07-01T15:26:00.000Z	Seveas	Cybermagellan	yes
2005-07-01T15:38:00.000Z	Seveas	Cybermagellan	no, that should just be localhost :)
2005-07-01T15:59:00.000Z	Cybermagellan	Seveas	so if the mails are wating in queue...and flushing the queue comes back with postqueue: warning: valid_hostname: numeric hostname: 68.231.152.140 postqueue: warning: valid_hostname: numeric hostname: 231.152.140 what does that mean?
2005-07-01T16:00:00.000Z	Seveas	Cybermagellan	no idea, i'm not that used to postfix...
