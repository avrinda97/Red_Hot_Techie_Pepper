2006-06-07T12:32:00.000Z	KenSentMe	Kr0ntab	is already installed on dapper
2006-06-07T12:33:00.000Z	KenSentMe	Kr0ntab	me too, but now it works. I unmarked all other connections then lo from /etc/network/interfaces, then reboot and it works
2006-06-07T12:34:00.000Z	KenSentMe	Kr0ntab	i tried to do it manually, but that didn't work either
2006-06-07T12:36:00.000Z	KenSentMe	Kr0ntab	so how did you get wpa running then?
2006-06-07T12:38:00.000Z	KenSentMe	Kr0ntab	could you pastebin your config file (without the key) ?
2006-06-07T12:40:00.000Z	Kr0ntab	KenSentMe	eth1 is my wireless interface...
2006-06-07T12:40:00.000Z	Kr0ntab	KenSentMe	the above pastebin should get ya going...
2006-06-07T12:41:00.000Z	KenSentMe	Kr0ntab	thanx
2006-06-07T12:41:00.000Z	Kr0ntab	KenSentMe	no prob....
2006-06-07T12:42:00.000Z	Kr0ntab	KenSentMe	also.. to get a good undertanding of what happens with the interface when it goes up and down... try "sudo ifup eth1 --verbose"
2006-06-07T12:42:00.000Z	Kr0ntab	KenSentMe	and "sudo ifdown eth1 --verbose".... they'll give you a nice run down of exactly what's happenin in the back ground...
2006-06-07T12:43:00.000Z	Kr0ntab	KenSentMe	"eth1" is my wireless interface... replace with yours of course
2006-06-07T12:48:00.000Z	KenSentMe	Kr0ntab	in my router i have a wpa passphrase, that's something different then the hash is it?
2006-06-07T12:50:00.000Z	Kr0ntab	KenSentMe	if you dont have your passphrase in a hash format... simply use the    psk="My password goes here..."    format...
2006-06-07T12:52:00.000Z	KenSentMe	Kr0ntab	when i do sudo ifdown wlan0 --verbose it says wlan0 not configured and when i do /etc/init.d/networking restart i get an error of no such device
2006-06-07T12:53:00.000Z	Kr0ntab	KenSentMe	"iwconfig" tells you which device is recognized as one with wireless extensions.  whats the name of yer device?
