2012-09-03T22:21:00.000Z	theseb	gordonjcp	aha! yes i rem that....the point of 64bit is to *ACCESS* more than 4Gb ram
2012-09-03T22:22:00.000Z	theseb	gordonjcp	now it is coming back to me
2012-09-03T22:22:00.000Z	gordonjcp	theseb	but as I said, you can get round that with PAE
2012-09-03T22:25:00.000Z	theseb	gordonjcp	lol...you are about to do the exact OPPOSITE of what i'm debating
2012-09-03T22:25:00.000Z	gordonjcp	theseb	have you got a good reason to switch?
2012-09-03T22:25:00.000Z	gordonjcp	theseb	if it works, don't fix it
2012-09-03T22:26:00.000Z	theseb	gordonjcp	i just figured if you got the hardware why not use it like it was meant to be used
2012-09-03T22:26:00.000Z	gordonjcp	theseb	it'll work, but flash will be even flakier than usual
2012-09-03T22:27:00.000Z	gordonjcp	theseb	firefox and thunderbird will consume twice as much memory and frequently go spinning off into 100% CPU usage
2012-09-03T22:28:00.000Z	theseb	gordonjcp	then how come 2 people few min ago just said all is fine for them? maybe that was the story 2 yrs ago?
2012-09-03T22:29:00.000Z	gordonjcp	theseb	maybe they've got 16GB of RAM
2012-09-03T22:30:00.000Z	theseb	gordonjcp	kind of funny that your memory usage gets punished if you're man enough to try 64bit
2012-10-04T23:44:00.000Z	gordonjcp	theseb	if your card does 3D acceleration then you're most likely using Unity 3D
2012-10-04T23:45:00.000Z	theseb	gordonjcp	i am using unity3d..i just don't know how to use it
2012-10-04T23:45:00.000Z	gordonjcp	theseb	click on stuff
2012-10-04T23:45:00.000Z	gordonjcp	theseb	type things in, where it seems appropriate
2012-10-04T23:45:00.000Z	theseb	gordonjcp	i never see a rotating cube if that is what i should see
