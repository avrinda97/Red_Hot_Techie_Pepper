2008-01-05T05:52:00.000Z	allobjects		Can someone recommend or have a link for using slower machine as lightweight client ?
2008-01-05T05:52:00.000Z	gyaresu	allobjects	Check out xubuntu
2008-01-05T05:54:00.000Z	allobjects	gyaresu	erUSUL: thanks, aware of xubuntu etc but I mean I want an older machine to seemlessly run a session off another faster box
2008-01-05T05:55:00.000Z	gyaresu	allobjects	k12ltsp linux terminal server project
2008-01-05T05:57:00.000Z	allobjects	gyaresu	thanks reading...
2008-01-05T06:09:00.000Z	allobjects	gyaresu	ltsp looks interesting but not sure if I want to go whole hog and have the lightweight client network boot
2008-01-07T06:26:00.000Z	gyaresu	allobjects	You probably need to add the wireless modules to /etc/modules
2008-01-07T06:28:00.000Z	allobjects	gyaresu	sorry still a bit of newbie, can you elaborate ?
2008-01-07T06:30:00.000Z	gyaresu	allobjects	yep. If you know which kernel modules are required for that wireless adapter you can add them to the file /etc/modules and all the modules listed in that file will get loaded into the kernel at startup. If you're having to restart networking then it's possibly because they are not getting loaded and part of the networking script would be checking for them.
2008-01-07T06:32:00.000Z	allobjects	gyaresu	so since the wireless card works after the restart is there a way to find you what modules I require ?
2008-01-07T06:33:00.000Z	gyaresu	allobjects	well as a dodgy way I'm thinking 'lsmod > notwork.txt' after start. Then restart networking (and when it's working) run 'lsmod > works.txt'
2008-01-07T06:33:00.000Z	gyaresu	allobjects	But there's surely a better way ;)
2008-01-07T06:34:00.000Z	allobjects	gyaresu	I'm sure and what is puzzling is this is a clean gutsy install
2008-01-07T06:34:00.000Z	gyaresu	allobjects	Yeah but this sort of thing can happen.
2008-01-07T06:37:00.000Z	allobjects	gyaresu	ok I've done the lsmod but should I now be comparing to something ?
2008-01-07T06:38:00.000Z	allobjects	gyaresu	sorry, my bad, you did say before and after ;-)
2008-01-07T06:39:00.000Z	allobjects	gyaresu	ok, will have to reboot, brb
2008-01-07T06:39:00.000Z	gyaresu	allobjects	the command 'lsmod > thing.txt' will output the lsmod results to the file thing.txt'
