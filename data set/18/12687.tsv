2006-04-13T08:56:00.000Z	ompaul	CraiZE	please do not use the enter key after a short line, please put all your thoughts on one line, thanks
2006-04-13T11:49:00.000Z	ompaul	CraiZE	that should help
2006-04-13T11:51:00.000Z	ompaul	CraiZE	what do you actually want to do with it anyway?
2006-04-13T11:52:00.000Z	ompaul	CraiZE	that is so simple that looking for a gui was a distraction
2006-04-13T11:53:00.000Z	ompaul	CraiZE	well change the value of the number for "Default" from 0 to what ever stanza (paragraph kind of thing) that other thing is on and save the file
2006-04-19T10:06:00.000Z	CraiZE	ompaul	are you the tyran that watches over ubotu ?
2006-04-19T10:06:00.000Z	ompaul	CraiZE	no, but I can be
2006-04-19T10:07:00.000Z	CraiZE	ompaul	i changed 2 entries earlier, fixres (added aticonfig comment) and samba, (i added the url in the end of samba)
2006-04-19T10:08:00.000Z	ompaul	CraiZE	as long as they are useful it works :)
2006-04-19T10:11:00.000Z	ompaul	CraiZE	I would suggest you add that to the samba on the wiki but -- I don't see anything on the fixres unlessyou did it on the wiki
2006-04-19T10:17:00.000Z	CraiZE	ompaul	for the fixres i added the ati config, its a really nifty "quickfix" compared to the other documentation ubotu links to and works perfectly, remember when i was annoying you about it? :P
2006-04-19T10:17:00.000Z	CraiZE	ompaul	and i dont know how to add to the wiki, or where the wiki is located :)
2006-04-19T10:18:00.000Z	ompaul	CraiZE	okay join me in #craize
2006-04-21T15:22:00.000Z	CraiZE	ompaul	i see a problem with it
2006-04-27T08:08:00.000Z	ompaul	CraiZE	#ubuntu-offtopic please :-)
