2008-03-19T09:22:00.000Z	Polishpaul	m1r	i'm assuming that you were able to browse other sites? Drivers got installed OK? Did you need any restricted drivers?
2008-03-19T09:24:00.000Z	m1r	Polishpaul	on 7.10 i had no problem, just plug usb in and run after regular install . i am browsing many other sites normaly, but on some it just disconects from wlan, then i have plug out, plug in and reconect procedure everytime
2008-03-19T09:28:00.000Z	Polishpaul	m1r	may i suggest looking up on forums/google? your first clues will be in the logs somewhere (usually messages is a good start). There may be some specific settings you may need to tweak with the wireless card? not sure...
2008-03-19T09:28:00.000Z	m1r	Polishpaul	ok , tnx for help m8
