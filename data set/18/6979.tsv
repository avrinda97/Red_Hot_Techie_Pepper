2008-07-22T19:29:00.000Z	untermensch	Muntrue	lol really ? i always rebooted
2008-07-22T19:30:00.000Z	Muntrue	untermensch	hehe it does not kill X , just switch shells
2008-07-22T19:31:00.000Z	untermensch	Muntrue	is there anyway to kill x ?
2008-07-22T19:31:00.000Z	Muntrue	untermensch	yea there is, i would have to look it up tho if you really want to know
2008-07-22T19:32:00.000Z	untermensch	Muntrue	no need for all the trouble. i was just curiouse. thanks though =]
2008-07-22T19:32:00.000Z	Muntrue	untermensch	why would you want to kill X tho
2008-07-22T19:33:00.000Z	untermensch	Muntrue	cause sometimes i feel REALLY smart when i can use the shell mode (ctrl + alt + f1)
2008-07-22T19:34:00.000Z	Muntrue	untermensch	lol but you can still use that one and go back to X with ctrl + akt + f4
2008-07-22T19:35:00.000Z	untermensch	Muntrue	lol, i always did sudo shutdown now, then went to "continue normal reboot"
2008-07-22T19:36:00.000Z	Muntrue	untermensch	Now there is no more need for that ;)
2008-07-22T19:37:00.000Z	untermensch	Muntrue	lol well yea. except for one of the options instead of "continue with normal reboot" is "fix x" which has come in handy a lot.
2008-07-22T19:37:00.000Z	Muntrue	untermensch	you can also restart X by hitting Ctrl + alt + backspace (dont test that now it will reboot X )
2008-07-22T19:38:00.000Z	untermensch	Muntrue	lol i had no idea. i tried that once cause i saw it on the forums.. but i didn'tk now what it did
2008-07-22T19:39:00.000Z	Muntrue	untermensch	It just restarts X so you can do that instead of a hard reboot
2008-07-22T19:39:00.000Z	untermensch	Muntrue	how could you even hit ctr + alt + backspace if you were in the situation that you would need to hard reboot?
2008-07-22T19:40:00.000Z	Muntrue	untermensch	I have never really had a situation where linux crashed so hard. but Ctrl + alt + backspace works just as well as switching shells.
2008-07-22T19:41:00.000Z	untermensch	Muntrue	i have.. =\ i think it's more of the dying hard drive i have though. =[
