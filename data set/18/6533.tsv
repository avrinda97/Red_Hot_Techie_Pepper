2008-10-09T02:25:00.000Z	BenB	albuntu	I know pastebin, thanks. these were just 2 lines.
2008-10-09T02:25:00.000Z	albuntu	BenB	: isnt it more simple for you to dump the database to a file and import it at the new database ?
2008-10-09T02:25:00.000Z	BenB	albuntu	no.
2008-10-09T02:26:00.000Z	BenB	albuntu	but it's an alternative, if I can't get this solves.
2008-10-09T02:26:00.000Z	albuntu	BenB	: maybe #mysql can help you better with your problem
2008-10-09T02:28:00.000Z	BenB	albuntu	it should be a simple permission problem, but I just don't get it.
2008-10-09T02:29:00.000Z	albuntu	BenB	: have you checked your user permissions ? have you tried with root that operation ? from what i see you are right. it should be a permissions problem
2008-10-09T02:30:00.000Z	albuntu	BenB	: look if your user is in the mysql group
2008-10-09T02:35:00.000Z	BenB	albuntu	yes, I have checked them several times: http://pastebin.ca/1223125
2008-10-09T02:38:00.000Z	albuntu	BenB	: i am sorry i cant help you. try #mysql . maybe someone knows
2008-10-09T02:40:00.000Z	BenB	albuntu	thanks
2008-10-09T02:47:00.000Z	BenB	albuntu	turns out ubuntu was at fault indeed: ubuntu uses apparmor by default. I never would have imagined that.
2008-10-09T02:48:00.000Z	BenB	albuntu	adding the dir to /etc/apparmor.d/usr.sbin.mysqld worked.
2008-10-09T02:48:00.000Z	albuntu	BenB	: maybe you installed apparmor without knowing. i had the same problem with apparmour for a port problem before. i didnt know that it can cause this kind of problem too
2008-10-09T02:50:00.000Z	BenB	albuntu	Dr_willis: possible that I installed apparmor without remembering. still, installing and having it activated for certain apps are very different things. it should not be *used* for mysql unless I tell it to.
