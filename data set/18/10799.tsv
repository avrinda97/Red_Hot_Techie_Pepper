2007-03-14T14:27:00.000Z	matason		Is there something "stronger" than rm -rf for removing files that seem to be corrupt?
2007-03-14T14:28:00.000Z	fnf	matason	how do you know it was corrupted ?
2007-03-14T14:28:00.000Z	matason	fnf	I'm guessing, the file attributes are all ?
2007-03-14T14:29:00.000Z	fnf	matason	nope, it indicates there's no user/group applied to it. Just use chown.
2007-03-14T14:29:00.000Z	matason	fnf	Thank you
2007-03-14T14:33:00.000Z	matason	fnf	I did chown user:group filename etc and I got "Cannot access --- no such file or directory"
2007-03-14T14:33:00.000Z	fnf	matason	are you sure the file is actually there ?. Where is it ?
2007-03-14T14:34:00.000Z	matason	fnf	It's listed when I do ls -la
2007-03-14T14:35:00.000Z	fnf	matason	what was the output of ls -la ?
2007-03-14T14:35:00.000Z	matason	fnf	?--------- ? ?    ?      ?                ?  the-file
2007-03-14T14:36:00.000Z	fnf	matason	gah, the file size doesn't even show up. In which case you'd want to fsck it first.
2007-03-14T14:36:00.000Z	matason	fnf	Ah OK thanks :)
2007-03-14T14:37:00.000Z	matason	fnf	So basically it is a corrupt file?
2007-03-14T14:38:00.000Z	matason	fnf	And fsck checks the disk?
2007-03-14T14:38:00.000Z	fnf	matason	I can't speak for sure. But most likely so.
2007-03-14T14:38:00.000Z	fnf	matason	yup, umount it then fsck.
2007-03-14T14:39:00.000Z	matason	fnf	Thanks for your help and also everyone else :)
2007-03-14T14:39:00.000Z	fnf	matason	you're welcome.
