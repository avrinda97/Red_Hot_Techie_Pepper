2009-06-07T02:38:00.000Z	brentv911		What is the best IRQ client to run on ubuntu.   I'm currently running MIRC through VINE.  but was wondering if there was a better one.
2009-06-07T02:39:00.000Z	brentv911		I like ICE CHAT but can't get it to run
2009-06-07T02:39:00.000Z	brentv911		yeah  IRC.. that is what i meant
2009-06-07T02:41:00.000Z	August23rd	brentv911	what features other than the obvious are you looking for in an IRC client
2009-06-07T02:42:00.000Z	brentv911	August23rd	| mainly stability..  it seems that running windows programs under Vine is a crap shoot at best..  But then again, I've only been using Ubuntu for about 3 days.  i'm normally a windows man.
2009-06-07T02:44:00.000Z	August23rd	brentv911	as a windows admin, i can tell you that pidgin is something you can get used to very easily since it runs on both windows and linux
2009-06-07T02:45:00.000Z	brentv911	August23rd	Ok. i see pidgin in my application list..  I will take a look at that.. didn't realize that it would do irc also.
2009-06-07T02:45:00.000Z	August23rd	brentv911	btw, welcome to the linux world, which distro are you running ubuntu or kbuntu
2009-06-07T02:46:00.000Z	brentv911	August23rd	i'm using Ubuntu 9.04 on a Dell Inspiron 6000 laptop
2009-06-07T02:46:00.000Z	brentv911	August23rd	lol scratch that.. I'm using 8.10.  i'm downloading 9.04 on my desktop.. that is why that number was on my mind
2009-06-07T02:51:00.000Z	brentv911	August23rd	 thanks for that tip.. just did it and gonna see what it looks like.   my only issue with linux operating systems.. is the fact that I grew up on windows.  And it is sooo hard to learn how to install things on here
2009-06-07T02:52:00.000Z	brentv911	August23rd	 lol  just different from what i'm used to..  learning curve.. lol
2009-06-07T02:52:00.000Z	August23rd	brentv911	your best friend in ubuntu (debian based distro) is the command sudo (since root is disabled by default
2009-06-07T02:55:00.000Z	August23rd	brentv911	totem since you're on a dell you might be able to get "dellbuntu" which gives you lindvd a closed source dvd player, but totem should work
2009-06-07T02:56:00.000Z	brentv911	August23rd	 cool thanks for that info.. I was going to try my cyberlink for windows through wine to see if that worked.. but i will look for those two

2009-06-07T03:01:00.000Z	brentv911	August23rd	 Thanks for all your help..  still have about 10 minutes before the Kbuntu desktop is done loading.  then i will try totem.  Thanks again.  I will be back
2009-06-07T03:01:00.000Z	August23rd	brentv911	ok cool let me know what you think
