2007-01-28T12:41:00.000Z	glyn		that link about the firewalls is alright
2007-01-28T12:41:00.000Z	glyn		but it doesn't tell me how to disable the firewall altogether
2007-01-28T12:41:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	glyn	easiest way to do firewalling is firestarter (it sets up connection sharing and dhcp too..)
2007-01-28T12:49:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	glyn	firestarter :)
2007-01-28T12:53:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	glyn	if your router is already configures to forward stuff to windows, I'd guess that your IP in Linux is different from in windows. Making it the same might help.
2007-01-28T13:31:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	glyn	'route' and find the gateway address. Type that into firefox, you should get the router's admin page that way
2007-01-28T13:33:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	glyn	cool. neither do it :)  There's a page somewhere that tells you how to configure port forwarding on most common routers, but I forget where it was!!
2007-02-17T13:10:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	glyn	same as any other; chmod +x foo.pl ; ./foo.pl
2007-02-17T13:12:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	glyn	usually just ./foo.sh will run it if it's in the current directory
2007-02-17T13:13:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	glyn	./WE.pl
2007-02-17T13:14:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	glyn	typing ./ means to run from the current directory, otherwise it will try and find it in your PATH
2007-02-17T13:15:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	glyn	head WE.pl, what's the first line of the file say?
2007-02-17T13:17:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	glyn	try "perl WeakIVGen.pl" perhaps?
2007-02-17T13:22:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	glyn	the WEP key will be in your router config.. how to get it depends totally on how your router works.
2007-02-17T13:23:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	glyn	yeah, that's where I'd start. Dig around, it should be in there somewhere
2007-02-17T13:25:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	glyn	is it the same box that provides your internet connection everywhere else?
2007-02-17T13:26:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	glyn	usually it'll be 192.168.0.254 or 10.0.0.1. You have the manual for it, the default will be in htere?
2007-02-17T13:27:00.000Z	zcat[1] 	glyn	is the config address still in your browser history?
