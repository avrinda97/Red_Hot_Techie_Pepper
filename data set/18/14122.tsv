2008-07-14T00:25:00.000Z	Flannel	Zamadatx	Have you installed ccsm yet?
2008-07-14T00:26:00.000Z	Flannel	Zamadatx	compiz is enabled by default, so that's not necessary.  You will however need to install compizconfig-settings-manager
2008-07-14T00:26:00.000Z	Flannel	Zamadatx	or simple-ccsm for a simpler one
2008-07-14T00:27:00.000Z	Flannel	Zamadatx	What version of Ubuntu are you running?
2008-07-14T00:28:00.000Z	Flannel	Zamadatx	you *dont* need to install compiz-fusion.  It's installed by default.  You *do* need to install the settings manager.  Add/remove probably won't have it.  use synaptic, or sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager, and then it'll show up in your preferences
2008-07-14T00:28:00.000Z	Flannel	Zamadatx	Its a graphical package manager, similar to add/remove (not as simple, but more powerful)
2008-07-14T00:29:00.000Z	Flannel	Zamadatx	System > Admin > Synaptic Package Manager
2008-07-14T00:50:00.000Z	Flannel	Zamadatx	NTFS
2008-07-14T00:53:00.000Z	Flannel	Zamadatx	#ubuntu-classroom, but it'll take longer for answers
2008-07-14T04:49:00.000Z	Flannel	Zamadatx	no, its mibibytes.  1024 * 1024 bytes
2008-07-14T04:49:00.000Z	Flannel	Zamadatx	"MB" as far as HDD mfcs are concerned are 1000 * 1000 bytes (or sometimes 1000 * 1024 bytes)
2008-07-14T04:50:00.000Z	Flannel	Zamadatx	1000 MiB is 1.024 times 1000 MB
2008-07-14T04:50:00.000Z	Flannel	Zamadatx	1 MiB is 1048576 bytes, 1MB is 1000000 bytes
2008-07-14T04:51:00.000Z	Flannel	Zamadatx	When dealing with 10^6ish numbers, not big.  But when you get into GB vs GiB, the differences become noticable
2008-07-14T05:03:00.000Z	Flannel	Zamadatx	No, use medibuntu
2008-07-14T05:03:00.000Z	Flannel	Zamadatx	well, a bin is right.  But its better to use a packaged version.
