2008-04-29T10:42:00.000Z	diktus		hello all
2008-04-29T10:42:00.000Z	diktus		i have wireless problem in ubuntu 8.04
2008-04-29T10:44:00.000Z	diktus		how to connect with intel pro wireless 3945
2008-04-29T10:44:00.000Z	diktus		the device is known but the light doesnt beep
2008-04-29T10:45:00.000Z	balleyn1	diktus	I'm using that wireless card, I believe - it works out the box though. What's your problem?
2008-04-29T10:45:00.000Z	balleyn1	diktus	what kind of laptop?
2008-04-29T10:46:00.000Z	balleyn1	diktus	I have a Lenovo ThinkPad T61. The wireless light doesn't work in Ubuntu (found a complicated patch to fix it...), but the wireless works fine. It just won't light up, that's all. Maybe that's the same for you?
2008-04-29T10:48:00.000Z	balleyn1	diktus	can you see any wireless networks?
2008-04-29T10:48:00.000Z	balleyn1	diktus	what happens when you type `iwconfig` into the terminal? any wireless extensions?
2008-04-29T10:50:00.000Z	balleyn1	diktus	ok, run `iwconfig` from the terminal and see if it lists an interface with wireless extensions
2008-04-29T10:51:00.000Z	balleyn1	diktus	when I run `iwconfig`, it says "no wireless extensions" for all my non-wireless interfaces, but it provides a bunch of other information for my wireless interface
2008-04-29T10:54:00.000Z	balleyn1	diktus	any luck?
2008-04-29T10:55:00.000Z	diktus	balleyn1	i dont know
2008-04-29T10:56:00.000Z	balleyn1	diktus	I'm not sure what will show up in the wifi area (i.e. top right, gnome notification area) if you don't have any wireless networks in the neighbourhood. But if you go to Accessories -> Terminal, type "iwconfig" and hit enter, you should see a list of all the detected network interfaces
2008-04-29T10:57:00.000Z	balleyn1	diktus	if the network interface isn't wireless, it will say "no wireless extensions". If it is wireless, it will display information about that network interface. If you have an interface that is wireless showing up, then it's detected alright and should be working
2008-04-29T10:58:00.000Z	balleyn1	diktus	oooh, sorry. Yes, iwconfig will still work even if there are no wifi networks in your area. You just won't be able to try connecting to anything, but iwconfig will still tell you if your wireless card has been detected and such
2008-04-29T11:05:00.000Z	balleyn1	diktus	menu start? you mean, the gnome applications menu? (top left hand corner)
2008-04-29T11:06:00.000Z	balleyn1	diktus	hmm... I know you can right-click and hit edit menu to change it in some ways, but that doesn't seem to allow you to change the logo or anything... not sure
