2006-11-20T12:21:00.000Z	kmaynard	slavik	wat filesystem?
2006-11-20T12:22:00.000Z	slavik	kmaynard	I am installing a second copy of dapper (to upgrade to edgy) and am resizing an existing dapper partition (to 100GB from 160GB which is the entire drive)
2006-11-20T12:22:00.000Z	kmaynard	slavik	what filesystem?
2006-11-20T12:23:00.000Z	slavik	kmaynard	ext3
2006-11-20T12:23:00.000Z	kmaynard	slavik	it may take a while then
2006-11-20T12:23:00.000Z	slavik	kmaynard	a while ... how long about? 2 hours? a day?
2006-11-20T12:23:00.000Z	kmaynard	slavik	it's a big partition...give it an hour or so
2006-11-20T12:24:00.000Z	kmaynard	slavik	that's a guess...
2006-11-20T12:28:00.000Z	slavik	kmaynard	thing is, the status is still at 0% even though it has been running for like 15min (at least) ...
2006-11-20T12:31:00.000Z	kmaynard	slavik	what program are you using
2006-11-20T12:32:00.000Z	slavik	kmaynard	the installer in dapper livecd :)
2006-11-20T12:33:00.000Z	kmaynard	slavik	in order to resize ext3, it has to be converted to ext2
2006-11-20T12:34:00.000Z	slavik	kmaynard	how come? doesn't iy just have to mvoe the pieces to fit within 100GB and change the inodes accordingly?
2006-11-20T12:34:00.000Z	kmaynard	slavik	such is the nature of ext3
