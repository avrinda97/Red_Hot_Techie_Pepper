2009-08-10T01:54:00.000Z	Alvinware	Gnea	You a Snort user?
2009-08-10T01:54:00.000Z	Gnea	Alvinware	just ask your question.
2009-08-10T01:55:00.000Z	Alvinware	Gnea	Is snort a detection, or prevention system?
2009-08-10T01:55:00.000Z	Gnea	Alvinware	detection.
2009-08-10T01:56:00.000Z	Alvinware	Gnea	But Snort web page have stated prevention too? What's the duration for a Snort rules update? Because of free Snort rules will only last 30 days, right?
2009-08-10T01:57:00.000Z	Gnea	Alvinware	#snort would be a better place to ask
2009-08-10T01:57:00.000Z	Alvinware	Gnea	Yeah, i know, but not active as here, and are you really a Snort user?
2009-08-10T02:00:00.000Z	Gnea	Alvinware	I use it a bit, but again, this is #ubuntu, where the emphasis is on Ubuntu. The information you request on snort is a bit more specialised. Not showing patience is the same as showing disrespect. I can only tell you that snort does detection, since it can't, by itself, prevent.
2009-08-10T02:03:00.000Z	Alvinware	Gnea	Not telling the true also consider immoral, and you should know that some room is completely clam with users.
2009-08-10T02:03:00.000Z	Gnea	Alvinware	pardon?
2009-08-10T02:06:00.000Z	Gnea	Alvinware	how can you claim that I'm lying to you? that's totally inappropriate. if you don't like the answer you've been given, then please do not go and accuse someone that you don't know of something like that. I will say this one more time: #ubuntu is for general Ubuntu help. If you want specialised help on something, you'll need to visit the appropriate channel.
2009-08-10T02:08:00.000Z	Alvinware	Gnea	You are newbie too.
2009-08-10T02:09:00.000Z	Gnea	Alvinware	negative, I've been using linux for over 10 years.
2009-08-10T02:09:00.000Z	Alvinware	Gnea	Snort?
2009-08-10T02:09:00.000Z	Gnea	Alvinware	in #snort
2009-08-10T02:14:00.000Z	Gnea	Alvinware	yes, that is why the #ubuntu-offtopic channel exists.
