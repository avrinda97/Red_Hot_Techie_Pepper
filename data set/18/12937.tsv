2006-02-24T11:20:00.000Z	jroes		should firefox ever use 165mb of ram? :P
2006-02-24T11:20:00.000Z	jroes		(it's using 16.5% mem and I've got 1gb)
2006-02-24T11:20:00.000Z	atoponce	jroes	how many tabs are open and how long have you been using it?
2006-02-24T11:20:00.000Z	jroes		I'm on kubuntu
2006-02-24T11:20:00.000Z	jroes		6 tabs, it's probably been open since yesterday
2006-02-24T11:21:00.000Z	atoponce	jroes	it is a caching feature.  the more you navigate, the more memory is occupied for faster page loading.
2006-02-24T11:21:00.000Z	jroes		ah
2006-02-24T11:21:00.000Z	atoponce	jroes	you can disable it
2006-02-24T11:21:00.000Z	jroes		good to know
2006-02-24T11:21:00.000Z	atoponce		but your pages will suffer in performance
2006-02-24T11:22:00.000Z	jroes		I don't mind it, except I doubt it works cooperatively enough with the OS to make sure that memory is available for use by other programs
2006-02-24T11:22:00.000Z	jroes		(if in desperate need
2006-02-24T11:22:00.000Z	atoponce		it'll keep eating away, but there is a cap, just not sure what it is
2006-02-24T11:23:00.000Z	jroes		it's also pretty odd considering I can open a new tab, type in http://www.google.com, then open another, and another, and continuously see it do a DNS lookup anyways
