2006-05-27T06:55:00.000Z	daryl_		Anyone know a good macro program for Linux, to repeat mouse clicks?
2006-05-27T06:57:00.000Z	theine	daryl_	what do you want to achieve?
2006-05-27T06:58:00.000Z	daryl_	theine	just trying to make my mouse do about 1500 mouse clicks for me.  to save my hand...
2006-05-27T06:58:00.000Z	daryl_	theine	i move my mouse to the bottom right of the window, pess a button, move the mouse to the top right press a button. i do that about 1500 moe times, and i'm done
2006-05-27T06:59:00.000Z	theine	daryl_	just curious, why do you need to do this?
2006-05-27T06:59:00.000Z	theine	daryl_	note: I don't know of any macro programs
2006-05-27T07:00:00.000Z	daryl_	theine	I added about 1200 categories to my site accidently, instead of making them sub-categories.  the method for removal is to remove them one at a time.
2006-05-27T07:01:00.000Z	daryl_	theine	ezmacros works great in windows. i'm thinking of just downloading it, and running it thorugh wine
2006-05-27T07:01:00.000Z	theine	daryl_	what are those categories you're talking about?
2006-05-27T07:01:00.000Z	daryl_	theine	product categories, in a store on a website.
2006-05-27T07:02:00.000Z	theine	daryl_	can't you just edit a file?
2006-05-27T07:02:00.000Z	daryl_	theine	i have direct access to the SQL database, but i'm not sure if it would damage dependancies by removing the categories.  and would rather not risk it.
2006-05-27T07:03:00.000Z	theine	daryl_	ah, i see
2006-05-27T07:03:00.000Z	theine	daryl_	so you're using some kind of graphical front-end to access the SQL database?
2006-05-27T07:03:00.000Z	daryl_	theine	yes
2006-05-27T07:04:00.000Z	theine	daryl_	which one?
2006-05-27T07:04:00.000Z	daryl_	theine	custom interface
