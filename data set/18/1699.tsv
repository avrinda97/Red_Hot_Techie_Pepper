2010-12-20T14:15:00.000Z	era878		guys why does my fresh ubuntu 10.10 netbook install look like the desktop version?
2010-12-20T14:16:00.000Z	nit-wit	era878	do you need to load graphic drivers?
2010-12-20T14:17:00.000Z	nit-wit	era878	look in menu-system-admin-additional drivers
2010-12-20T14:19:00.000Z	nit-wit	era878	also at the login screen there is a button after you choose or type you name for desktop choice, are you sure it is the netbook verson?
2010-12-20T14:20:00.000Z	nit-wit	era878	 this command in the terminal will identify the graphic card   lspci | grep VGA
2010-12-20T14:26:00.000Z	era878	nit-wit	after typing "lspci | grep VGA" terminal says "00:02 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation 82852/855GM Integrated Graphics Device (rev 02)"
2010-12-20T14:27:00.000Z	nit-wit	era878	did you look in the menu-system-admin-additional drivers
2010-12-20T14:28:00.000Z	era878	nit-wit	it says "no propietary drivers are in use on this system"
2010-12-20T14:28:00.000Z	nit-wit	era878	I would reboot it or logout to the login in window and type or choose your name and check the buttons for the netbook desktop.
2010-12-20T14:30:00.000Z	era878	nit-wit	at the bottom of the screen it says "Ubuntu Desktop Edition" how can I install the netbook edition?
2010-12-20T14:31:00.000Z	nit-wit	era878	I'm not sure to tell you the truth it is the unity desktop
2010-12-20T14:31:00.000Z	era878	nit-wit	what ?
2010-12-20T14:32:00.000Z	nit-wit	era878	I don't know how, and the netbook desktop is called unity
2010-12-20T14:33:00.000Z	era878	nit-wit	is there a way to solve this problem
2010-12-20T14:34:00.000Z	era878	nit-wit	when i logout it says ubuntu desktop edition, not ubuntu netbook edition
2010-12-20T14:34:00.000Z	nit-wit	era878	do you hava link to the cd you downloaded
2010-12-20T14:35:00.000Z	era878	nit-wit	http://www.ubuntu.com/netbook/get-ubuntu/download
2010-12-20T14:37:00.000Z	nit-wit	era878	thats the netbook version, not really sure use the Ubuntu forums for help as well, I have to crash.
