2010-07-26T21:07:00.000Z	corpsegrindr		I am getting very slow data transfer speeds on my ubuntu box. going from sdd1 to sda1 im transfering at about 200kbps. would that have anything to do with the OS its self? (sdd1 is 72000rpm sda1 is 59000rpm)
2010-07-26T21:09:00.000Z	edbian	corpsegrindr	How are you copying the data?  Simply clicking and dragging?
2010-07-26T21:09:00.000Z	corpsegrindr	edbian	yeah, would a cp work better?
2010-07-26T21:11:00.000Z	edbian	corpsegrindr	Eh, it's probably just that it's a bit level copy because you have to physically move the data.  Usually when you move files / folders around it's fast because that's a virtual change.  The files don't actually move on the hdd.  However when you copy from one hdd to another it's slower because it has to physically copy the bits.
2010-07-26T21:11:00.000Z	edbian	corpsegrindr	It's actually extremely fast.  Think about what you said, 200,000 bits every second.  The computer is copying 200,000 ones and zeros every second.
2010-07-26T21:12:00.000Z	corpsegrindr	edbian	Yeah but moving from sata to sata i should be getting more around 5mb+
2010-07-26T21:13:00.000Z	edbian	corpsegrindr	Do you mean 5mb+ per second?
2010-07-26T21:13:00.000Z	corpsegrindr	edbian	yes
2010-07-26T21:15:00.000Z	edbian	corpsegrindr	Ohh, you're right.  Testing on my debian system sata to pata drive I'm getting about 25Mb/second
2010-07-26T21:16:00.000Z	edbian	corpsegrindr	What's your processor like?
2010-07-26T21:16:00.000Z	corpsegrindr	edbian	amd64 dual 2.4, running on a headless linux lucid server
2010-07-26T21:17:00.000Z	edbian	corpsegrindr	Your headless linux server has a gui?
2010-07-26T21:17:00.000Z	corpsegrindr	edbian	no, im on my desktop connected to it via ssh
2010-07-26T21:17:00.000Z	edbian	corpsegrindr	I digress.  It really should be faster, you're right.  I do not know why it is slow.  Maybe something is clogging up the cpu?  check top
2010-07-26T21:18:00.000Z	edbian	corpsegrindr	wait, you're copying the files over the network?
2010-07-26T21:19:00.000Z	edbian	corpsegrindr	You're not making sense?  What machine are these two hdds in?
2010-07-26T21:20:00.000Z	corpsegrindr	edbian	My server, i use a window on this desktop via sftp and move one file to another on my server box
2010-07-26T21:21:00.000Z	edbian	corpsegrindr	Oh, I get it now.  Yeah, bottom line, local hdd copy to another local hdd should be at least 15Mb / second on a system like that.  Check top.
