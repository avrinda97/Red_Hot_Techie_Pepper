2009-11-01T18:07:00.000Z	om26er1	juro	sorry got disconnected
2009-11-01T18:07:00.000Z	juro	om26er1	no problem. this is the abbreviated version of my fdisk -l: http://pastebin.com/m8144cb2
2009-11-01T18:08:00.000Z	om26er1	juro	you want to mount sdb1?
2009-11-01T18:08:00.000Z	juro	om26er1	yes
2009-11-01T18:08:00.000Z	om26er1	juro	sudo mkdir /media/sdb1
2009-11-01T18:09:00.000Z	om26er1	juro	what is the filesystem type.. xfs?
2009-11-01T18:10:00.000Z	juro	om26er1	same error "special device /dev/sdb1 does not exist" ..... ext3
2009-11-01T18:10:00.000Z	om26er1	juro	if you go to places does it show your drive
2009-11-01T18:10:00.000Z	juro	om26er1	as it cannot mount the /home drive, all I get is the emergency console
2009-11-01T18:11:00.000Z	om26er1	juro	sdb1 is your previous home directory and you want to use it now?
2009-11-01T18:12:00.000Z	juro	om26er1	.... seems like I am repeating myself here ...... yes
2009-11-01T18:12:00.000Z	om26er1	juro	you won't believe but today my brother had the same problem in fedora and he lost all of his data and i was unable to help him
2009-11-01T18:13:00.000Z	juro	om26er1	thank you for building me up!
2009-11-01T18:14:00.000Z	om26er1	juro	but the question still is why won't it mount. he was able to mount his /home partition but could not use it
2009-11-01T18:14:00.000Z	juro	om26er1	that is a different issue then
2009-11-01T18:14:00.000Z	om26er1	juro	i think the filesystem is not ext3
2009-11-01T18:14:00.000Z	juro	om26er1	I am booting into the live cd now and see what is wrong
2009-11-01T18:27:00.000Z	juro	om26er1	so live cd can axess /dev/sdb1 without any problems
