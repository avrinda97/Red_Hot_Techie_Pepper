2009-07-26T03:59:00.000Z	muibe		so there's no answer to my question? or then my question was so astoundingly stupid that no one really stoops to say a word about it...
2009-07-26T04:00:00.000Z	bazhang	muibe	did not see the question
2009-07-26T04:01:00.000Z	muibe	bazhang	how is it possible to make all the external devices read-only ones?
2009-07-26T04:01:00.000Z	bazhang	muibe	why do you need to set this
2009-07-26T04:02:00.000Z	muibe	bazhang	because i want to prevent copying of the stuff into an external media
2009-07-26T04:24:00.000Z	bazhang	muibe	these external devices are what filesystem
2009-07-26T04:25:00.000Z	muibe	bazhang	i am not sure i understood what you tried to say with filesystem...
2009-07-26T04:26:00.000Z	bazhang	muibe	ntfs? vfat? ext3? like that
2009-07-26T04:27:00.000Z	muibe	bazhang	yeah..i figured out that i should know it beforehand and a usb-memory could partitioned with whatever imaginable fs available to linux user...
2009-07-26T04:28:00.000Z	muibe	bazhang	so...there is no solution without i know fs beforehand?
2009-07-26T04:28:00.000Z	bazhang	muibe	hdd or flash drive
2009-07-26T04:28:00.000Z	muibe	bazhang	hdd
2009-07-26T04:30:00.000Z	bazhang	muibe	have you formatted the drives? if you have not they are likely ntfs
2009-07-26T04:34:00.000Z	bazhang	muibe	lets keep this in channel please
2009-07-26T04:35:00.000Z	muibe	bazhang	sorry... hopefully you understood my motive though
2009-07-26T04:36:00.000Z	bazhang	muibe	will you be wanting them to be read only permanently; that seems an extreme method
2009-07-26T04:36:00.000Z	muibe	bazhang	yes..
2009-07-26T04:37:00.000Z	muibe	bazhang	it's 21th century paranoia.. :D
