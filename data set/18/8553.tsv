2007-08-08T16:44:00.000Z	dgeorge		hey guys is there going to be any way to use the bbc iplayer with linux
2007-08-08T16:45:00.000Z	dgeorge		I think its awesome that you can go and download the shows but can't do it if you have linux
2007-08-08T16:46:00.000Z	lockd	dgeorge	where are you having problems downloading shows?
2007-08-08T16:46:00.000Z	lockd	dgeorge	oh, bbc has a special downloader
2007-08-08T16:48:00.000Z	lockd	dgeorge	realplayer is windows as well.. Mplayer should handle it though
2007-08-08T16:48:00.000Z	lockd	dgeorge	sudo aptitude install mplayer
2007-08-08T16:52:00.000Z	lockd	dgeorge	any luck?
2007-08-08T16:52:00.000Z	dgeorge	lockd	installing it now....
2007-08-08T05:02:00.000Z	lockd	dgeorge	amarok follows the "listen in stand alone media player"
2007-08-08T05:09:00.000Z	lockd	dgeorge	got it?
2007-08-08T05:35:00.000Z	dgeorge	lockd	how did you get it to work
2007-08-08T05:35:00.000Z	lockd	dgeorge	using the play in external real player, or something
2007-08-08T05:37:00.000Z	lockd	dgeorge	save the .ram file somewhere, add mplayer before the address, then 'sh filename.ram'
2007-08-08T05:38:00.000Z	lockd	dgeorge	any luck?
2007-08-08T05:39:00.000Z	lockd	dgeorge	oh, nice
2007-08-08T05:39:00.000Z	lockd	dgeorge	didn't know that even existed for linux
2007-08-08T05:46:00.000Z	lockd	dgeorge	for what?
2007-08-08T05:46:00.000Z	lockd	dgeorge	thought you got it working
