2008-12-08T02:37:00.000Z	Alonda		Hey all
2008-12-08T02:39:00.000Z	Alonda		Does anyone know how i can install/compile nVidia Drivers on 8.10?
2008-12-08T02:40:00.000Z	jrib	Alonda	system -> administration -> hardware drivers
2008-12-08T02:40:00.000Z	Alonda	jrib	now drivers are listed
2008-12-08T02:40:00.000Z	jrib	Alonda	so install them
2008-12-08T02:41:00.000Z	Alonda	jrib	from the nVidai website?
2008-12-08T02:41:00.000Z	jrib	Alonda	no... from hardware drivers...
2008-12-08T02:43:00.000Z	Alonda	jrib	their are no drivers listed in hardware, i can't install any..
2008-12-08T02:43:00.000Z	jrib	Alonda	what card?
2008-12-08T02:43:00.000Z	Alonda	jrib	nVidia Corporation NV5M64 [RIVA TNT2 Model 64/Model 64 Pro] (rev 15)
2008-12-08T02:46:00.000Z	Alonda	jrib	should I switch back to 8.04? Maybe it'll list the drivers then?..
2008-12-08T02:47:00.000Z	jrib	Alonda	do the release notes mention your card?
2008-12-08T02:47:00.000Z	Alonda	jrib	it's an old card, so idk.. i'll check the release notes though
2008-12-08T02:48:00.000Z	Alonda	jrib	thanks
2008-12-08T02:52:00.000Z	Alonda	jrib	the release notes say: will be transitioned on upgrade to the free nv driver instead. but no nv driver has been installed, and i've alreasy run an update?
2008-12-08T02:52:00.000Z	jrib	Alonda	how do you know no nv driver has been installed?
2008-12-08T02:52:00.000Z	Alonda	jrib	i don't it's just i can't use and effects..
2008-12-08T02:53:00.000Z	jrib	Alonda	right, you probably can't use them with the free driver I guess (though I'm not sure)
