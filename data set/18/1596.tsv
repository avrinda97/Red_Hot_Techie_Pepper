2011-03-10T16:59:00.000Z	Curly_Q		Schuffle, is the 127.0.0.2 considered the loopback address for tunnelling?
2011-03-10T17:00:00.000Z	Curly_Q		It seems like a bypass address for the 127.0.0.1 loopback.
2011-03-10T17:02:00.000Z	Curly_Q		Pumpking nice explanation.
2011-03-10T17:02:00.000Z	schnuffle	Curly_Q	they use 127.0.0.2 to avoid conflicts
2011-03-10T16:40:00.000Z	schnuffle	Curly_Q	FreeNX is a good alternative when you have only small bandwidth
2011-03-10T16:46:00.000Z	schnuffle	Curly_Q	es I have, you must activate remote portforwarding to use it: http://martybugs.net/smoothwall/puttyvnc.cgi
2011-03-10T17:00:00.000Z	schnuffle	Curly_Q	not really
2011-03-10T17:00:00.000Z	schnuffle	Curly_Q	it's a coice
2011-03-10T17:27:00.000Z	schnuffle	Curly_Q	you only need your box and the box yu want to connect to, nothing more
2011-03-10T17:27:00.000Z	schnuffle	Curly_Q	and of course te remote box needs ssh enabled
2011-03-10T17:28:00.000Z	schnuffle	Curly_Q	it was the first hit from google, mybe I should lookup a better example
2011-03-10T17:29:00.000Z	schnuffle	Curly_Q	the important part is that you use remote portforwarding
2011-03-10T17:30:00.000Z	schnuffle	Curly_Q	FreeNX uses ssh by default to connect
2011-03-10T17:42:00.000Z	schnuffle	Curly_Q	aptitude is the recommended way of installing it unites apt-get and apt-cache and has better dependency resolution
2011-03-10T17:42:00.000Z	schnuffle	Curly_Q	Before I install a package I do a aptitude update, just to be sure to have the actual package list
2011-03-10T18:12:00.000Z	schnuffle	Curly_Q	What did you install?
2011-03-10T18:14:00.000Z	schnuffle	Curly_Q	I think I used the default keys
2011-04-27T16:18:00.000Z	schnuffle	Curly_Q	You experience with NX or with seveas?
