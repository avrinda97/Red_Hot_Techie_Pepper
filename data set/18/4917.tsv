2010-02-02T17:39:00.000Z	ubuntu_novice		Hello ! I am facing issues with ubuntu 9.X series... I am not able to perform any internet based connectivity
2010-02-02T17:39:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	ubuntu_novice	Err. See above. :X
2010-02-02T17:39:00.000Z	ubuntu_novice		The connection seems fine, I can ping ip as well as fqdns but nothing else works
2010-02-02T17:40:00.000Z	ubuntu_novice	kinja-sheep	It is blank
2010-02-02T17:40:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	ubuntu_novice	That probably is the problem.  You know your router's IP?
2010-02-02T17:40:00.000Z	ubuntu_novice		I tried to enter the router ip but it still doesnt work
2010-02-02T17:40:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	ubuntu_novice	It should have "nameserver 192.168.1.1" in it.
2010-02-02T17:40:00.000Z	ubuntu_novice		moreover how am I able to ping google via ip or anything ?
2010-02-02T17:41:00.000Z	ubuntu_novice		kinja I tried name server 192.168.X.X ie my ip of router but still no luck
2010-02-02T17:41:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	ubuntu_novice	Did you restart networking too when you changed the resolv.conf?
2010-02-02T17:42:00.000Z	ubuntu_novice		what do you mean by restart networking ? I did rebooted system but no luck
2010-02-02T17:45:00.000Z	ubuntu_novice		any other suggestion ?
2010-02-02T17:46:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	ubuntu_novice	You said you reboot the system (but why is resolv.conf empty?) You're on another machine?
2010-02-02T17:47:00.000Z	ubuntu_novice		I am using windows 7 right now
2010-02-02T17:48:00.000Z	ubuntu_novice		since ubuntu didnt work so I had to go back to installation of windows 7 to get on to internet
2010-02-02T17:48:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	ubuntu_novice	Try this --> sudo mv /etc/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf-bak && echo "nameserver 192.168.1.1" | sudo tee /etc/resolv.conf && sudo service networking restart && sudo service network-manager restart
2010-02-02T17:53:00.000Z	ubuntu_novice	kinja-sheep	what will this command do ? One more thing you said my /etc/resolv.conf is empty .. how did you see the file and more importantly does windows 7 has /etc/resolv.conf file ? :O
2010-02-02T17:54:00.000Z	kinja-sheep	ubuntu_novice	No. Windows 7 does not have /etc/resolv.conf -- That is for *unix. I thought you're having network issues with your Ubuntu machine?
