2011-08-28T02:11:00.000Z	Kingsy		ok guys just curious, I have just setup evolution to handle my mail.. I opened it and when I went to close it the left pane greyed out and it refuses to close. I can minimise it expand it etc etc.. just not close it..
2011-08-28T02:11:00.000Z	Kingsy		does this mean the application has crashed and I should kill it?
2011-08-28T02:12:00.000Z	Kingsy		nm I just killed it..
2011-08-28T02:13:00.000Z	qin	Kingsy	How many emails do you have on your accouts, since evolution may need time to import them
2011-08-28T02:14:00.000Z	Kingsy	qin	hmm naa it crashed when I quit. no idea why, I just killed it and restarted and quit.. it worked ok
2011-08-28T02:15:00.000Z	Kingsy	qin	if however I have evolution closed. and I sent myself an email (and in evolution I had ticked the box to check for mail every 10 mins) does the application need to be open or will it check in the background?
2011-08-28T02:16:00.000Z	qin	Kingsy	evolution have notifier, which if runs will display topup in case of new emails.
2011-08-28T02:16:00.000Z	Kingsy	qin	is this something I need to install seperatly?
2011-08-28T02:17:00.000Z	qin	Kingsy	No, it should be there.
2011-08-28T02:17:00.000Z	Kingsy	qin	hmm ok
