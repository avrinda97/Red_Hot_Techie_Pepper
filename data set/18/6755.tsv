2008-04-06T00:50:00.000Z	grigora		Hi, every now and then, my wireless stops working, I get an IP address through DHCP, with DNS servers in /etc/resolv.conf, iwconfig shows a good connection, but I can't even ping the router ... When I reboot into Windows, everything works fine, but when I go back to Linux, my networking stops working. Sometimes in Windows I need to do the "Repair connection" connection thing in order for my wireless to work. Any ideas/suggestions? With th

2008-04-06T00:53:00.000Z	grigora	linnux	thanks, but what do you think the issue is?
2008-04-06T00:55:00.000Z	linnux	grigora	could be many things
2008-04-06T00:56:00.000Z	grigora	linnux	for example ...
2008-04-06T00:57:00.000Z	grigora	linnux	but when you start the system up and it runs dhcp, doesn't it check that?
2008-04-06T00:58:00.000Z	linnux	grigora	i cant see your config so i dont know
2008-04-06T00:58:00.000Z	grigora	linnux	you mean in /etc/networking/interfaces ?
2008-04-06T00:59:00.000Z	grigora	linnux	the thing is that I am not even sure where Network Manager stores its configuration, it's all very confusing ...
2008-04-06T01:08:00.000Z	grigora	linnux	ok, and ...
2008-04-06T01:02:00.000Z	grigora	linnux	what's pm?
2008-04-06T01:05:00.000Z	grigora	linnux	never got the private message ...
2008-04-06T01:06:00.000Z	grigora	linnux	 not really sure what's there to "figure out" ... you either know the abbreviation or you don't
2008-04-06T01:07:00.000Z	linnux	grigora	nano -w /etc/conf.d/net
2008-04-06T01:07:00.000Z	grigora	linnux	can't do that now, I am in Windows ... what should I look for there?
2008-04-06T01:09:00.000Z	linnux	grigora	i need to go sorry i cant help out more i dont know what you're asking for then
2008-04-06T01:11:00.000Z	grigora	linnux	ok, thanks for your help, I am fairly sure the dhcp is working, but I don't know if my dns cache needs to be cleared or why my networking wouldn't work even when I have an IP and default GW and DNS server IPs in /etc/resolv.conf
2008-04-06T01:21:00.000Z	grigora	linnux	/etc/conf.d isn't there ... and now my networking works in Linux and that's the problem because the behavior is not consistent
