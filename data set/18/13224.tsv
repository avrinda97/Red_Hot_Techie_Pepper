2007-07-17T08:30:00.000Z	aaron_		Can anyone help me with an SSH VPN?
2007-07-17T08:31:00.000Z	Tarantulafudge	aaron_	ssh... VPN??
2007-07-17T08:31:00.000Z	Tarantulafudge	aaron_	like, ssh tunneling?

2007-07-17T08:31:00.000Z	aaron_	Tarantulafudge	no.
2007-07-17T08:31:00.000Z	aaron_		point-to-point vpn
2007-07-17T08:31:00.000Z	Tarantulafudge	aaron_	...tunneling
2007-07-17T08:32:00.000Z	aaron_		Tarantulafudge.. ok, a tunneling vpn.
2007-07-17T08:32:00.000Z	Tarantulafudge	aaron_	I think you are confused about what ssh is
2007-07-17T08:32:00.000Z	aaron_		I am not.
2007-07-17T08:33:00.000Z	Tarantulafudge	aaron_	well then you are misguided
2007-07-17T08:33:00.000Z	aaron_		That's probably better
2007-07-17T08:33:00.000Z	aaron_		http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/539
2007-07-17T08:33:00.000Z	aaron_		that's what i've set up.
2007-07-17T08:35:00.000Z	aaron_		I have the two networks connected.  my client and server can ping each other just fine, but i'm not able to reach machines on the remote netowrk,
2007-07-17T08:35:00.000Z	Tarantulafudge	aaron_	this is a temporary solution?
2007-07-17T08:35:00.000Z	aaron_		It's not any kind of solution if I can't make it work :)
2007-07-17T08:36:00.000Z	Tarantulafudge	aaron_	my experiences with ssh  tunneling have been less than spectacular, even with insane ttl's and keepalive heartbeats ssh tunnels are unreliable for any kind of constant traffic, I suggest OpenVPN as an alternative to ssh (probably a bit easier to setup as well).
