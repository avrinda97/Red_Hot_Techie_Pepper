2008-07-06T07:28:00.000Z	shyam_k		hi my friend has vista and ubuntu in dual boot and now as the ubuntu partition got deleted accidentially,the grub is not loading.. installing the grub from a live cd will work even if there is only vista in the hdd..right?i.e. now the ubuntu partition has been added to the partition used with vista..so ubuntu is not there..
2008-07-06T07:29:00.000Z	DIL	shyam_k	huh?
2008-07-06T07:30:00.000Z	shyam_k	DIL	i just want to know whether grub will work in a system with only vista..
2008-07-06T07:31:00.000Z	DIL	shyam_k	reinstall ubuntu and it will be fine if you want vista only boot in safe mode with vista cd and fixboot or fixmbr
2008-07-06T07:32:00.000Z	DIL	shyam_k	it will see the available space
2008-07-06T07:34:00.000Z	shyam_k	DIL	making use of available space wont hurt data in that partition?
2008-07-06T07:34:00.000Z	DIL	shyam_k	because thetr is nothing there
2008-07-06T07:35:00.000Z	DIL	shyam_k	unused space
2008-07-06T07:37:00.000Z	shyam_k	DIL	g6pd_ ok ubuntu's parition is now a part of vista's data partition and making use of the unused space in that data partition wont harm the data in that partition?i am not sure of the way how guided partitioning works..i always use to go for manual partitioning,...
2008-07-06T07:37:00.000Z	DIL	shyam_k	sb
2008-07-06T07:37:00.000Z	shyam_k	DIL	sb?
2008-07-06T07:38:00.000Z	shyam_k	DIL	ook np
2008-07-06T07:39:00.000Z	DIL	shyam_k	i use defaults
2008-07-06T07:41:00.000Z	shyam_k	DIL	g6pd_ now the thing is he just cant boot to vista that the grub shows error,..i said him to re install grub with ubuntu live cd.. so that he can boot in to vista for once and have the parition seperated from vista and then installing ubuntu again in the freed parition..but for that i just wanted to verify that grub works even there is only vista..
2008-07-06T07:42:00.000Z	DIL	shyam_k	if you want vista only boot in safe mode with vista cd and fixboot or fixmbr
2008-07-06T07:43:00.000Z	shyam_k	DIL	oh ok
2008-07-06T07:43:00.000Z	shyam_k	DIL	just wanted to instruct him a solution using ubuntu:)
2008-07-06T08:00:00.000Z	shyam_k	DIL	unfortunately(or fortunately) he dont have vista cd with him,but he has ubuntu cd with him..now i see http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=224351 this thread to install grub from live cd.. it has this command "find /boot/grub/stage1"  and that should output something like (hd0,1) no matter what operating system he has in disk right?
