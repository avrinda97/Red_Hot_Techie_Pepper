2005-04-04T15:54:00.000Z	Rebroad		#kubuntu seems very quiet
2005-04-04T15:54:00.000Z	apokryphos	Rebroad	It has its moments... seems to be just people passing through at the mo.
2005-04-05T06:06:00.000Z	apokryphos	Rebroad	There was some talk of that not so long ago. Team has quite a bit at the mo to do, but I think it might be worth suggesting after Hoary final is out.
2005-04-15T15:07:00.000Z	Rebroad	apokryphos	just before you logged in, I said "Hi. I'm running hoary with the latest updates and my PC keeps freezing now (but didn't do this before some recent kernel-image and xserver-xorg updates). Anyone else experienced this? BTW, I'm using nvidia-glx"
2005-04-15T15:08:00.000Z	apokryphos	Rebroad	Bah; evil kernel/nvidia. Well, pretty much same problem here
2005-04-15T15:08:00.000Z	apokryphos	Rebroad	irssi is *not* pretty.
2005-04-15T15:08:00.000Z	Rebroad	apokryphos	are you managing to use X? I am, but it keeps freezing, and I have to shutdown by pressing the power button- that's the only way to continue!
2005-04-15T15:09:00.000Z	Rebroad	apokryphos	who is irssi?
2005-04-15T15:09:00.000Z	apokryphos	Rebroad	not really; if I select "nv" as driver I can only get around 640xsomething resolution
2005-04-15T15:09:00.000Z	apokryphos	Rebroad	with vesa, it goes pretty crazy, but gets the resolution right. Neither I could really stick with
2005-04-15T15:09:00.000Z	apokryphos	Rebroad	it's a text-based IRC client
2005-04-15T15:09:00.000Z	Rebroad	apokryphos	oh.. I'm able to use nv and nvidia with 2.6.10-5-686, but only nv with 2.6.11
2005-04-15T15:10:00.000Z	apokryphos	Rebroad	I've only got 2.6.10 here
2005-04-15T15:10:00.000Z	Rebroad	apokryphos	but when I saw "working" i mean- it freezes sometimes. not even Ctrl-Alt-F1 unfreezes it :(
2005-04-15T15:11:00.000Z	apokryphos	Rebroad	ergh. That sucks. I hope these problems are fixed soon.. it's not the first time it's happened.
2005-04-15T15:40:00.000Z	apokryphos	Rebroad	well, finally got it working, though temporarily now using 386 kernel.
2005-04-15T15:40:00.000Z	Rebroad	apokryphos	ah.. hmm. i think maybe i should try that also
2005-04-15T15:41:00.000Z	apokryphos	Rebroad	using 2.6.10-7 here
