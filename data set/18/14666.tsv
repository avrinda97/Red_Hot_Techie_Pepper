2005-11-05T08:38:00.000Z	Recyclable		anything that involves the chimes crashes, so i think it  may be something to do with that, but i've already deleted .Xauthority and .ICEauthority
2005-11-05T08:39:00.000Z	dabaR	Recyclable	does it work to restart X when it freezes?
2005-11-05T08:39:00.000Z	Recyclable	dabaR	i'm a bit nooby, so I don't know what that really is tbh :/
2005-11-05T08:40:00.000Z	dabaR	Recyclable	what do you do when it freezes?
2005-11-05T08:40:00.000Z	Recyclable	dabaR	i reset the pc and come ask for help :P
2005-11-05T08:42:00.000Z	dabaR	Recyclable	/server irc.freenode.net gets you connected to freenode, then /join #ubuntu
2005-11-05T08:42:00.000Z	dabaR	Recyclable	are you in windows now?
2005-11-05T08:43:00.000Z	dabaR	Recyclable	ya, thats a better idea, reset and ctrl+alt+f2 gets you to a terminal, then irssi starts irc, then /server irc.freenode.net gets you connected to freenode, then /join #ubuntu
2005-11-05T08:44:00.000Z	dabaR	Recyclable	that is just to get you h ere while in ubuntu...
2005-11-05T08:44:00.000Z	dabaR	Recyclable	dont waste time, tho
2005-11-05T08:51:00.000Z	Recyclable	dabaR	nope, i can't do anything
2005-11-05T08:51:00.000Z	Recyclable	dabaR	although i didn't actually try to restart X
2005-11-05T08:53:00.000Z	Recyclable	dabaR	what should I try now then? :/
2005-11-05T08:53:00.000Z	dabaR	Recyclable	did you reboot after having locked up? what os are you in?
2005-11-05T08:54:00.000Z	Recyclable	dabaR	i rebooted, and went back into text mode and irssi
2005-11-05T08:55:00.000Z	dabaR	Recyclable	ok, good, well, dunno, you can try reading some logs, like dmesg
2005-11-05T08:55:00.000Z	dabaR	Recyclable	/join #flood
2005-11-05T09:10:00.000Z	dabaR	Recyclable	i dont know how to fix it.
