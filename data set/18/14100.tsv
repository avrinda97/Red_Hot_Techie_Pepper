2010-01-31T00:05:00.000Z	Flannel	nord	Try installing linux-generic (the generic kernel) and switching to it (instead of the server kernel)
2010-01-31T00:06:00.000Z	Flannel	nord	Why do you need the server one?
2010-01-31T00:07:00.000Z	Flannel	nord	I don't think the server kernel would be required for those
2010-01-31T00:08:00.000Z	Flannel	nord	the server kernel won't help you do that.  Try switching to generic, see if it helps.
2010-01-31T00:09:00.000Z	Flannel	nord	No, it means you should try the generic kernel.  server kernel has a lot of hardware that it never expects to interface with removed so it can run better
2010-01-31T00:09:00.000Z	Flannel	nord	Try the generic kernel
2010-01-31T00:11:00.000Z	Flannel	nord	Just knowing whether the generic kernel works will help answer that question.
2010-01-31T00:12:00.000Z	Flannel	nord	The kernel has *absolutely* nothing to do with that.  You won't learn linux faster/better with the server kernel, nor does the generic kernel require you to have a pretty desktop
2010-01-31T00:15:00.000Z	Flannel	nord	Probably.
2010-01-31T00:15:00.000Z	Flannel	nord	But it very likely would require you to recompile
2010-01-31T00:16:00.000Z	Flannel	nord	Switch to the generic kernel
