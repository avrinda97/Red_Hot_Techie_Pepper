2006-08-09T13:13:00.000Z	umsteiger		can sombody help me, i am having a usb stick but it isn't detected automatically ... what do I have to do?
2006-08-09T13:14:00.000Z	mathieu_	umsteiger	you must install the kernel modules that  will reconise your usb bus, then load the modules that load a usb storage device
2006-08-09T13:16:00.000Z	umsteiger	mathieu_	Aren't the modules installed automatically? Or do you mean I have to load them ... in the later case, how to make that permanently? ... and one more question, the USB Device (Bus) is already showing up under the devicemanager, isn't that enough?
2006-08-09T13:17:00.000Z	mathieu_	umsteiger	is sdhci module loaded ?
2006-08-09T13:17:00.000Z	mathieu_	umsteiger	modules are not always loaded automatically
2006-08-09T13:17:00.000Z	mathieu_	umsteiger	you load them with modprobe modulename
2006-08-09T13:18:00.000Z	mathieu_	umsteiger	you can change /etc/modules and add module names that you want to load at boot
2006-08-09T13:19:00.000Z	umsteiger	mathieu_	Now it is loaded
2006-08-09T13:19:00.000Z	mathieu_	umsteiger	can you mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/sda1 ?
2006-08-09T13:20:00.000Z	mathieu_	umsteiger	mkdir /mnt/sda1
2006-08-09T13:23:00.000Z	umsteiger	mathieu_	The module is loaded, but I can't mount ...
2006-08-09T13:28:00.000Z	umsteiger	mathieu_	ls -al /dev/sda1 ... no such file ... is there anything more I can do? Do I need another module for the USB-Hub in my monitor?
2006-08-09T13:29:00.000Z	mathieu_	umsteiger	you may need other modules
2006-08-09T13:30:00.000Z	mathieu_	umsteiger	I have usblp  usbcore  usblp,ehci_hcd,uhci_hcd
2006-08-09T13:35:00.000Z	umsteiger	mathieu_	I tried those modules, still no luck ...
2006-08-09T13:37:00.000Z	mathieu_	umsteiger	check out the modules listed on this page : http://ubuntuforums.org/archive/index.php/t-5151.html
2006-08-09T13:38:00.000Z	umsteiger	mathieu_	Ok, looks like I have to do some more investigation ... thanks for your help
2006-08-09T14:02:00.000Z	umsteiger	mathieu_	Whoot ... on my next try nautilus freezed ... and then again, repeatedly ... however I got it to work, the only thing I must not do is using the display's usb-hub
