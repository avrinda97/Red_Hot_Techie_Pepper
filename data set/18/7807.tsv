2007-11-20T00:08:00.000Z	aladinsane		hey, i just formated one of myntfs drives to ext3 with Gparted, but now when I'm done with that I do not have permissions to change stuff on it, how can I give my user full permissions?
2007-11-20T00:10:00.000Z	sandaru1	aladinsane	did you add that to fstab?
2007-11-20T00:10:00.000Z	aladinsane	sandaru1	nope, never heard about it, what do i do?
2007-11-20T00:11:00.000Z	sandaru1	aladinsane	that means you just mounted.. there are some mount options.. gmask, umask.. check those
2007-11-20T00:12:00.000Z	sandaru1	aladinsane	fstab is used to mount file system at boot time.. check /etc/fstab
2007-11-20T00:19:00.000Z	aladinsane	sandaru1	yes in my fstab only the drive with xubuntu on it shows up.
2007-11-20T00:21:00.000Z	sandaru1	aladinsane	if you are just mounting the drive.. then try mount options, umask and gid
2007-11-20T00:22:00.000Z	aladinsane	sandaru1	im not sure what u meant with "just mounting", this is a drive that sits in my computer and will stay there till the end of times, and i just want to be able to write to it
2007-11-20T00:23:00.000Z	sandaru1	aladinsane	can you read the files in that drive somewhere?
2007-11-20T00:23:00.000Z	sandaru1	aladinsane	/media/something?
2007-11-20T00:24:00.000Z	aladinsane	sandaru1	theres no files on t, i just formated/partitioned it with gparted to ext3 from ntfs
2007-11-20T00:25:00.000Z	aladinsane	sandaru1	it shows up in nautilus and thunar though, but i cant write to it, it says that i do not have the permissions
2007-11-20T00:25:00.000Z	sandaru1	aladinsane	are you going to use that drive everyday or is it for just now?
2007-11-20T00:25:00.000Z	aladinsane	sandaru1	till i die
2007-11-20T00:26:00.000Z	sandaru1	aladinsane	a quick solution would be to go to terminal.. sudo nautilus /media/sdXX
2007-11-20T00:27:00.000Z	sandaru1	aladinsane	anyhow if you are going to use that frequently.. you'll have to add that to fstab
2007-11-20T00:28:00.000Z	sandaru1	aladinsane	if sudo nautilus can't write in that drive.. then that means your drivers doesn't support writing.. install ntfs-3g.. sudo apt-get install ntfs-3g
2007-11-20T00:31:00.000Z	aladinsane	sandaru1	why should i install anything with ntfs? i just removed nfts from it and am now running ext3, and how do i add it to fstab. I mean the drive is totally empty right now, i can do whatever necceassary to get it to work, and as i said this is a drive that will forever be a part of my system
