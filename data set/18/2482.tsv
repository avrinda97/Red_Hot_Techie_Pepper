2010-08-08T20:46:00.000Z	TomOwens		I'm having trouble with my Ubuntu install - all of the repositories have very out of date versions of software. What can I do to fix this? For example, I can only obtain version 3.0.6 of Mozilla Thunderbird - the current version is 3.1.2...
2010-08-08T20:47:00.000Z	TomOwens		Is that through apt?
2010-08-08T20:47:00.000Z	TomOwens		apt dist-upgrade?
2010-08-08T20:47:00.000Z	edbian	TomOwens	What version is it?
2010-08-08T20:47:00.000Z	TomOwens		Running the latest. Just downloaded and installed it two days ago.
2010-08-08T20:47:00.000Z	TomOwens		10.04 LTS
2010-08-08T20:47:00.000Z	edbian	TomOwens	Check this https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FirefoxNewVersion
2010-08-08T20:49:00.000Z	TomOwens		That's for FireFox. I want Thunderbird. But is out-of-date repositories going to be a recurring problem with Ubuntu?
2010-08-08T20:49:00.000Z	TomOwens		I want to always be running the latest stable versions of all of my software.
2010-08-08T20:50:00.000Z	TomOwens		And if that's not in the primary Ubuntu repositories, that's going to be a major problem.
2010-08-08T20:51:00.000Z	TomOwens		I think I will, then. I went with Ubuntu since I know a lot of people who use it, but if I can't be running latest stables, then it's not for me. I guess I'll look at Arch. Are there any other distribitions I should be looking at that meet my needs?
2010-08-08T20:52:00.000Z	edbian	TomOwens	Arch is great for bleeding edge software.  Be aware though "stable" and "new" are not the same.  I use Debian for that reason exactly.
2010-08-08T20:53:00.000Z	TomOwens	edbian	That's my problem. I want stable, up-to-date software. When someone releases a new stable version, I want it available to me quickly through my repositories.
2010-08-08T20:53:00.000Z	edbian	TomOwens	You and I have different definitions of stable my friend.  I think what you're asking for though is arch.
2010-08-08T20:53:00.000Z	TomOwens		Stable is anything that's not a nightly/weekly build.
2010-08-08T20:54:00.000Z	TomOwens		For example, Mozilla Thunderbird 3.1.2 is Stable. As would 3.1.3 be. But the nightly builds of Firefox and Thunderbird...not stable.
2010-08-08T20:54:00.000Z	edbian	TomOwens	For me stable means "it does not crash and has 0 or very few bugs"
2010-08-08T20:55:00.000Z	edbian	TomOwens	I understand what you're asking for though.  Arch linux is your best bet.  In fact it might even have un-stable software by your definition.
