2009-05-11T21:58:00.000Z	stepram		hello I'm looking for some help with ubuntu and Firefox - firefox keeps graying out when you open it
2009-05-11T21:58:00.000Z	Halitech	stepram	do you have compiz enabled?
2009-05-11T21:59:00.000Z	Halitech	stepram	maybe try disabling it and see if it still happens
2009-05-11T22:02:00.000Z	Halitech	stepram	have  you installed the restricted drivers for the video card?  any updates done lately?
2009-05-11T22:03:00.000Z	Halitech	stepram	maybe try the restricted drivers or the drivers from ati
2009-05-11T22:07:00.000Z	Halitech	stepram	stepram you've got a slightly better system then me so not sure why the lag
2009-05-11T22:08:00.000Z	stepram	Halitech	thanks for trying it just freezes now and again, Compiz still works and and when I check top Firefox is using 100% on one processor and 2gb ram!
2009-05-11T22:10:00.000Z	Halitech	stepram	what kinds of pages are you on when it seems to freeze?
2009-05-11T22:13:00.000Z	stepram	Halitech	, can be anything, normally freezes on homepage, which is the mozila page, since in re-installed it
2009-05-11T22:13:00.000Z	Halitech	stepram	ok, something sounds screwy with ff then
2009-05-11T22:15:00.000Z	stepram	Halitech	yeh some of the guys i work with suggested removing java because it doesn't work well with x64???
2009-05-11T22:15:00.000Z	Halitech	stepram	java used to be a sore spot but it seems to be fine now
2009-05-11T22:17:00.000Z	stepram	Halitech	 my java is still screwed cant get simplehelp to work on it, have to use IE6 on wine !
2009-05-11T22:17:00.000Z	Halitech	stepram	maybe try removing it then
2009-05-11T22:19:00.000Z	stepram	Halitech	 did it earlier but still froze, just used the package manager, no change, only plug ins are flash player and google toolbar
2009-05-11T22:20:00.000Z	Halitech	stepram	maybe try disabling flash plugin?
