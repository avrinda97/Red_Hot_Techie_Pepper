2009-07-29T18:26:00.000Z	Halabund	jrib	THanks, I'll try that
2009-07-29T18:25:00.000Z	jrib	Halabund	put the windows option at the top before the debian automagic kernel list
2009-10-31T16:51:00.000Z	jrib	Halabund	complete reinstall
2009-10-31T16:51:00.000Z	Halabund	jrib	thanks
2009-10-31T16:51:00.000Z	jrib	Halabund	well it's probably possible but completely unsupported and likely to cause frustration and hammer-wielding...
2009-10-31T16:52:00.000Z	Halabund	jrib	I've had enough of that, that's why I want to go back to Jaunty.  Reinstall then.
2011-10-30T15:06:00.000Z	jrib	Halabund	try starting gvim from a terminal and look for output
2011-10-30T15:14:00.000Z	Halabund	jrib	it doesn't say anything in the terminal.  It does go into insert mode eventually but only after about a 10-second delay.  I tried to re-install vim completely using synaptic, and also remove all systemwide vim-addons (it was only latex-suite), but the same thing still happens
2011-10-30T15:14:00.000Z	jrib	Halabund	which version of vim did you install? vim-gnome, vim-gtk, etc?
2011-10-30T15:15:00.000Z	Halabund	jrib	vim-gnome
2011-10-30T15:15:00.000Z	jrib	Halabund	try uninstalling that and installing vim-gtk.  See if issue persists.  This is mainly just to narrow down the problem.  We can switch back to -gnome later
2011-11-04T15:04:00.000Z	jrib	Halabund	the list *is* editable
2011-11-04T15:05:00.000Z	Halabund	jrib	can you please tell me HOW to edit it ... ?
2011-11-04T15:05:00.000Z	jrib	Halabund	click on the right column after selecting the appropriate row. Then you can hit a new key or just hit backspace
2011-12-31T01:34:00.000Z	jrib	Halabund	just use the packages from the repositories for texlive or if you insist use equivs (but I don't recommend this)
2011-12-31T01:36:00.000Z	Halabund	jrib	the repositories (or: any repository that I managed to google up) contains a very outdated version of texlive.  I am already using packages which are too new to work with this (I used them on Windows with MikTeX).  I don't want to rewrite my tex files just because ubuntu doesn't include up to date versions of texlive.
2011-12-31T01:36:00.000Z	Halabund	jrib	what are equivs?  Does that thing allow me to skip installing texlive?
2011-12-31T01:37:00.000Z	jrib	Halabund	apt-cache show equivs
