2007-08-12T16:07:00.000Z	excessluggage	Pelo	and others: I have definately got the fglrx working (and running right now) and the vert and horiz lines for my monitor are taken off the windows monitor .inf file.  Default depth is 24 and default res is 1400x900 at 24 but still only 1024x768.  Any other ideas on what to check?

2007-10-14T05:47:00.000Z	excessluggage	Pelo	yeah ati is just the identifier can be pretty much what you want as long as the other sections match.  i just reconfigured using dpkg-reconfigure xserver... as i could not get it to work manually reconfiguring xorg.conf either
