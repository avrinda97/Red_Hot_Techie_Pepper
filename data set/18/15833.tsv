2006-02-24T13:03:00.000Z	intelikey		wastrel caution.  if there is an xorg.conf in the $PWD and you run startx it will read that one rather than the one in /etc/X11/    i had a big fight with that the other day.
2006-02-24T13:03:00.000Z	wastrel	intelikey	 i don't think he knows the startx command but thx for the tip :]

2006-03-05T12:52:00.000Z	wastrel	intelikey	 won't mean much to me.
2006-03-05T12:53:00.000Z	wastrel	intelikey	 did you install the ssh package?  it Just Works for me.
2006-03-05T13:21:00.000Z	wastrel	intelikey	 did you make changes to your ssh config?
2006-03-05T13:26:00.000Z	wastrel	intelikey	 the guest user exists on the system?
2006-03-05T13:27:00.000Z	wastrel	intelikey	 what shell does the guest user have in /etc/passwd

2006-03-05T13:29:00.000Z	wastrel	intelikey	 just checking - if it's /bin/false or something you'd get that behavior
2006-03-24T10:29:00.000Z	wastrel	intelikey	 i have a lo block in /etc/network/interfaces  you probably should too?

2006-03-24T10:37:00.000Z	wastrel	intelikey	 i thought everyone needed a functional loopback network interface - i guess only if you're going to be using network apps...
2006-03-24T10:38:00.000Z	wastrel	intelikey	 but you just had to manually configure it ?
