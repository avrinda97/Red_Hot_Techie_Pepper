2006-06-03T14:57:00.000Z	Sjoerd-		When setting up a new server, should I wait for release version 6.06 ?
2006-06-03T14:57:00.000Z	Fujitsu	Sjoerd-	it's been released!
2006-06-03T14:58:00.000Z	Sjoerd-	Fujitsu	Ah ok on ubuntulinux.nl I saw it still has to be released. But that's probably outdated. :)
2006-06-03T14:58:00.000Z	Fujitsu	Sjoerd-	it's been down for a while.
2006-06-04T16:20:00.000Z	Fujitsu	Sjoerd-	what type of card is it?
2006-06-04T16:20:00.000Z	Sjoerd-	Fujitsu	It's a SiS
2006-06-04T16:20:00.000Z	Fujitsu	Sjoerd-	you're sure there's no driver?
2006-06-04T16:22:00.000Z	Sjoerd-	Fujitsu	It is onboard lan from a Asus Barebone T2-AE1, with SIS190/191, I have checked the SiS website but the download is down
2006-06-04T16:22:00.000Z	Sjoerd-	Fujitsu	I have found some old driver for fedora core but I don't think that will be of any use, will it?
2006-06-04T16:22:00.000Z	Fujitsu	Sjoerd-	it may be.
2006-06-04T16:22:00.000Z	Fujitsu	Sjoerd-	can I have a link?
2006-06-04T16:24:00.000Z	Fujitsu	Sjoerd-	I've got it.
2006-06-04T16:25:00.000Z	Fujitsu	Sjoerd-	that's a nasty fix, but it'd probably work.
2006-06-04T16:26:00.000Z	Sjoerd-	Fujitsu	I have no idea where to start, nobody cares to reply on the forums :(
2006-06-04T05:09:00.000Z	Fujitsu	Sjoerd-	Midnight Commander?
2006-06-04T05:09:00.000Z	Sjoerd-	Fujitsu	Do you advise using it, or something else?
2006-06-04T05:09:00.000Z	Fujitsu	Sjoerd-	depends what you want to do.
2006-06-04T05:09:00.000Z	Sjoerd-	Fujitsu	For a webserver
