2009-11-13T07:41:00.000Z	SeaPhor	carpunky	are you using a recent cd? I mean one since it was officially released?
2009-11-13T07:42:00.000Z	SeaPhor	carpunky	does it happen after an update?
2009-11-13T07:54:00.000Z	SeaPhor	carpunky	just type sea and hit the "tab" key to reply to me
2009-11-13T07:45:00.000Z	SeaPhor	carpunky	i'd do a fschk,, may be a hardware issue, since u have windows then open "my computer" and right click on C drive and go to tools tab, do the disk error checking with both tabs checked..
2009-11-13T07:48:00.000Z	SeaPhor	carpunky	why would u do that? what chipset you have for your wireless card?
2009-11-13T07:53:00.000Z	SeaPhor	carpunky	when you use ndiswrapper and the "windows" drivers,, that means you do not want to use the drivers available to Linux, what is your wireless card? do this in a terminal to find:  sudo lshw -C network    the "C" is capital
2009-11-13T07:56:00.000Z	SeaPhor	carpunky	its-  sudo lshw -C network    the "C" is capital
2009-11-13T07:59:00.000Z	SeaPhor	carpunky	its called "tab-completion"   if you type seap and hit tab and it will either complete my nick or another's, hit tab again and it will go to the next, maybe mine
