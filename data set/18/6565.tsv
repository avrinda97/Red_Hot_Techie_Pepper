2008-08-04T20:28:00.000Z	fde	chase_	just back up your home directory
2008-08-04T20:28:00.000Z	fde	chase_	there is also conduit to save various other things in a nicer way
2008-08-04T20:29:00.000Z	fde	chase_	it is generally unnecessary to backup such things.
2008-08-04T20:29:00.000Z	chase_	fde	can you explain that again? I didnt quite get it.
2008-08-04T20:29:00.000Z	fde	chase_	what doesn't you understand? I'm not sure what you might not have understood...
2008-08-04T20:30:00.000Z	fde	chase_	you can just create a boot disk for Linux, and install GRUB back to the MBR
2008-08-04T20:31:00.000Z	fde	chase_	man grub-floppy
2008-08-04T20:32:00.000Z	fde	chase_	ahh, 'grub-mkrescue' sorry
2008-08-04T20:32:00.000Z	chase_	fde	I have only been using linux for 3 days, I dont know what a MBR is or some other stuff you said
2008-08-04T20:32:00.000Z	fde	chase_	MBR isn't something Linux specific.
2008-08-04T20:33:00.000Z	chase_	fde	I still dont recognize that abbreviation
2008-08-04T20:33:00.000Z	fde	chase_	master boot record... it is how PC's boot.
2008-08-04T20:34:00.000Z	chase_	fde	oh, I havent seen it abbreviated before
2008-08-04T20:34:00.000Z	fde	chase_	on Windows, the 'format' command even takes /mbr as an option  :/
2008-08-04T20:35:00.000Z	fde	chase_	has since MS-DOS 3 or something
2008-08-04T20:43:00.000Z	chase_	fde	its because I am not linux savy and it would take me a long time to set it back up
