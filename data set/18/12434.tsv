2006-04-20T07:11:00.000Z	devie		hey guys, I'm running a Dell Optiplex GX260 (P4 2.0GHz / 1GB RAM) and using the onboard Intel chipset video card. When I installed FC5 recently, I could set my display up to 1200x1024, but with Ubuntu it only gives me the option up to 1024x768, can anyone point me to a reference to get this fixed?
2006-04-20T07:13:00.000Z	devie		I can try to google it though
2006-04-20T07:15:00.000Z	wezzer	devie	and it *should* work :^)
2006-04-20T07:12:00.000Z	wezzer	devie	what kind of monitor do you have?
2006-04-20T07:12:00.000Z	devie	wezzer	17" dell
2006-04-20T07:12:00.000Z	wezzer	devie	do you know it's horizontal and vertical sync rates by heart?
2006-04-20T07:13:00.000Z	devie	wezzer	umm, no - It's a cheap $200 computer I bought to play around with, I don't have any manuals
2006-04-20T07:13:00.000Z	wezzer	devie	ahum, but do you what model it is?
2006-04-20T07:14:00.000Z	devie	wezzer	ultrascan p780
2006-04-20T07:14:00.000Z	wezzer	devie	ok, wait a second and I'll ask google what are those sync rates :)
2006-04-20T07:14:00.000Z	devie	wezzer	yeah, I can find my sync rates, but how do I tell linux about them :)
2006-04-20T07:15:00.000Z	wezzer	devie	umm, there is file /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2006-04-20T07:15:00.000Z	wezzer	devie	you should put those rates there
2006-04-20T07:15:00.000Z	wezzer	devie	and then restart X
2006-04-20T07:16:00.000Z	devie	wezzer	thanks, I'll try it :)
2006-04-20T07:16:00.000Z	wezzer	devie	ask if you get any problems
2006-04-20T07:16:00.000Z	wezzer	devie	there is also step-by-step config program which can be used if editing that file is hard or something
2006-04-20T07:31:00.000Z	devie	wezzer	sethk: I tried running dpkg-reconfigure and it does detect my monitor and video card properly, just doesn't offer me the 1280x1024 resolution, so I modified xorg.conf and that worked
