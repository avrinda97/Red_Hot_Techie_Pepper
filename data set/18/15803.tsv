2005-02-22T17:04:00.000Z	Nightie		D'oh! Ubuntu is MUCH better!
2005-02-22T17:04:00.000Z	Nightie		than gentoo...
2005-02-22T17:05:00.000Z	Nightie		I quite agree
2005-02-22T17:06:00.000Z	Nightie		I have learnt a LOT of things installing gentoo, but compiling it's a real pain
2005-02-22T17:08:00.000Z	Nightie		ah, ok
2005-02-22T17:09:00.000Z	Nightie		You have already tried google, I think
2005-02-22T17:10:00.000Z	Nightie		If I have a winxp laptop and an ubuntu pc connected to a 4 ports adsl router, how can I have them communicating?
2005-02-22T17:12:00.000Z	Nightie		Ehr... this is the point: I don't know WHAT can I do... can I share folders? can I write on NTFS from linux? and viceversa?
2005-02-22T17:12:00.000Z	Gagatan	Nightie	you don't want to write NTFS over TCP/IP ;)
2005-02-22T17:12:00.000Z	Nightie		why?
2005-02-22T17:13:00.000Z	Gagatan	Nightie	you can ssh/sftp from your XP to your linux, and you can use smbclient/samba from linux to XP. You can also install Samba on linux and let XP think your linux is just another windows host
2005-02-22T17:15:00.000Z	Nightie	Siddartha	:: try www.distrowatch.com for a partial list
2005-02-22T17:16:00.000Z	Nightie		so... with samba... can I write linux hard disk from winxp and viceversa?
2005-02-22T17:16:00.000Z	Gagatan	Nightie	yes
2005-02-22T17:16:00.000Z	Nightie		great!
2005-02-22T17:17:00.000Z	Nightie		Is it difficult to install samba?
2005-02-22T17:17:00.000Z	Nightie	Siddartha	:: no problem
2005-02-22T17:17:00.000Z	Gagatan	Nightie	apt-get install samba ;)
