2010-10-26T15:29:00.000Z	JohnFlux	mondova	sorry what are you trying to do?
2010-10-26T15:29:00.000Z	JohnFlux	mondova	upgrade openssh on 8.10 ?
2010-10-26T15:29:00.000Z	mondova	JohnFlux	apt-get won't update openssh and it hasn't since 2008 even though 8.10 stopped being supported april 2010
2010-10-26T15:30:00.000Z	JohnFlux	mondova	and you need an updated version openssh?
2010-10-26T15:30:00.000Z	mondova	JohnFlux	yes. its 4.7 way out of date
2010-10-26T15:30:00.000Z	JohnFlux	mondova	you could change your /etc/apt/sources  to the latest ubuntu version
2010-10-26T15:31:00.000Z	JohnFlux	mondova	and then _just_ install openssh
2010-10-26T15:31:00.000Z	JohnFlux	mondova	then switch your sources back again
2010-10-26T15:31:00.000Z	mondova	JohnFlux	nice thanks mate
2010-10-26T15:31:00.000Z	JohnFlux	mondova	it usually works :-D  if it tries to update your entire system, then cancel :-D
2010-10-26T15:32:00.000Z	JohnFlux	mondova	but if it only wants to upgrade a few packages, it's probably fine
2010-10-26T15:32:00.000Z	JohnFlux	mondova	np
2010-10-26T15:33:00.000Z	JohnFlux	mondova	to be safe, you could write down the list of packages that it installs.  If it screws up, just remove those packages and reinstall (with the apt/sources.conf pointing to the 8.10 repos)
2010-10-26T15:36:00.000Z	JohnFlux	mondova	just being "supported" doesn't mean it has the latest packages up to that point
2010-10-26T15:36:00.000Z	mondova	JohnFlux	why not?
2010-10-26T15:36:00.000Z	JohnFlux	mondova	openssh would have _only_ been upgraded if there was a serious security flaw
2010-10-26T15:37:00.000Z	mondova	JohnFlux	by upgraded you mean in the packages?
2010-10-26T15:37:00.000Z	JohnFlux	mondova	right
