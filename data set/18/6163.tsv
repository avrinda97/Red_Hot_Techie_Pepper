2008-07-12T03:42:00.000Z	andycas		What is the default root password
2008-07-12T03:42:00.000Z	gordonjcp	andycas	there isn't one
2008-07-12T03:43:00.000Z	andycas	gordonjcp	When i left psw blank it didnt log in
2008-07-12T03:43:00.000Z	gordonjcp	andycas	correct
2008-07-12T03:43:00.000Z	gordonjcp	andycas	that would be because there is no password set
2008-07-12T03:45:00.000Z	andycas	gordonjcp	How do i set a password? (I do not have a sudo user)
2008-07-12T03:46:00.000Z	gordonjcp	andycas	uhm, you should fix sudo ;-)
2008-07-12T03:46:00.000Z	andycas	gordonjcp	How, i have no sudoers, i cant access root to give myself sudo rights either
2008-07-12T03:47:00.000Z	gordonjcp	andycas	you're in a pickle
2008-07-12T03:47:00.000Z	andycas	gordonjcp	recovery mode should log me in as a root though, yes?
2008-07-12T03:47:00.000Z	gordonjcp	andycas	you can't go root because you've lost sudo?
2008-07-12T03:47:00.000Z	gordonjcp	andycas	it should
2008-07-12T03:47:00.000Z	andycas	gordonjcp	So how would i give sudo right to my user in there?
2008-07-12T03:48:00.000Z	gordonjcp	andycas	ok, so what did you do, change your groups without remembering to leave yourself in "admin"?
2008-07-12T03:49:00.000Z	gordonjcp	andycas	what did you do that might have caused the problem?
2008-07-12T03:49:00.000Z	andycas	gordonjcp	I installed new shiny 8.04, but my username was bad, so i tried to change it but i couldnt, so i created a new one and immediately deleted the old sudo one
2008-07-12T03:49:00.000Z	gordonjcp	andycas	oh ok
2008-07-12T03:50:00.000Z	gordonjcp	andycas	that's easy then - log into the recovery console, and say "usermod -G -a admin <username>"
