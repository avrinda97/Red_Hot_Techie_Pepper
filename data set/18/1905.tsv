2010-10-11T17:34:00.000Z	blue112		Hello here.
2010-10-11T17:34:00.000Z	blue112		I really need help
2010-10-11T17:36:00.000Z	blue112		I've ugraded from 10.04 to 10.10, and now everything is broken, the problem come from my graphic card, which is an ATI HD5570. I'm using free radeon driver from git, and it doesn't seem to work. I can't figure out how to install a non-beta restricted ATI driver (catalyst). Can someone help ?
2010-10-11T17:36:00.000Z	blue112		XChat fire at startup, but I don't have a terminal, and my cursor is a big X :p
2010-10-11T17:38:00.000Z	blue112		can I have some help :( ?

2010-10-11T17:40:00.000Z	darael	blue112	Have you tried running first "jockey-text -l" to find the name of the restricted driver and then "sudo jockey-text -e <name>" to set it up?  If there's a version in the Ubuntu repositories, those two will find and install it.
2010-10-11T17:40:00.000Z	blue112	darael	I never heard about that command, would that work in recovery mode ?
2010-10-11T17:41:00.000Z	darael	blue112	Yup, it's a command-line version of the restricted drivers tool.
2010-10-11T17:41:00.000Z	darael	blue112	"sudo reboot" or "sudo telinit 6".
2010-10-11T17:41:00.000Z	blue112	darael	I don't have a terminal.
2010-10-11T17:42:00.000Z	darael	blue112	Ah.  You may have to force power-cycle it, then.
2010-10-11T17:42:00.000Z	blue112	darael	mkay, I'll do with sysreq then?
2010-10-11T17:46:00.000Z	blue112	darael	dbus.exceptions.DBusException: org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.NoServer: Failed to connect to socket /var/run/dbus/system_bus_socket: Connexion refus√©e
2010-10-11T17:46:00.000Z	darael	blue112	Hmm, that's an interesting one.  I haven't seen that before.  Sounds like dbus isn't running... try a "sudo service dbus start" and then doing it again.
2010-10-11T17:47:00.000Z	blue112	darael	start: Job is already running: dbus
2010-10-11T17:47:00.000Z	darael	blue112	O...K... I'm all out of ideas, sorry.
2010-10-11T17:48:00.000Z	blue112	darael	any other way I can have a working graphic desktop ?
