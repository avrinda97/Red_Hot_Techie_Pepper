2010-07-20T18:01:00.000Z	cablop		i send my machine to hibernate yesterday.... now it is sleeping and seems that i's not willing to wake up
2010-07-20T18:01:00.000Z	cablop		what can i do?
2010-07-20T18:01:00.000Z	thewanderer1	cablop	hibernate is nothing more than a shutdown with RAM saved to SWAP.... just power it on
2010-07-20T18:03:00.000Z	thewanderer1	cablop	was it hibernated or suspended to S3?
2010-07-20T18:03:00.000Z	thewanderer1	cablop	can you see anything when you switch to a console
2010-07-20T18:04:00.000Z	thewanderer1	cablop	it does happen... Linux hibernate doesn't support every hardware out there
2010-07-20T18:04:00.000Z	thewanderer1	cablop	with my Acer I had to wait a year for proper support... be patient :P
2010-07-20T18:58:00.000Z	thewanderer1	cablop	did you reboot to see if it actually mounts it with acl option?
2010-07-20T18:58:00.000Z	thewanderer1	cablop	then your kernel is weird
2010-07-20T19:00:00.000Z	cablop	thewanderer1	or maybe i don't know how to put the acl in the fstab, do you know how? i was exhausted to look here and there in google with no much luck
2010-07-20T19:01:00.000Z	thewanderer1	cablop	put it in OPTIONS column
2010-07-20T19:06:00.000Z	cablop	thewanderer1	that was the problem i had it like ext3,acl defaults, i think it's where defaults is... but... now i don't know what to place instead defaults
2010-07-20T19:07:00.000Z	thewanderer1	cablop	next to defaults like this:  ext3     defaults,acl
2010-07-20T19:07:00.000Z	thewanderer1	cablop	be sure to read `man fstab` too, voodoo is not a good method
2010-07-20T19:09:00.000Z	cablop	thewanderer1	i know, i'm not voodooing, i just a little rusted, i used fstab but years ago, now i'm getting a headache just trying to remember how to... well, what i want is how to know what is the defaults options
2010-07-20T19:09:00.000Z	thewanderer1	cablop	defaults are undefined, I never put them there... manpage might tell you that
2010-07-20T19:09:00.000Z	thewanderer1	cablop	if in doubt, exclude defaults
