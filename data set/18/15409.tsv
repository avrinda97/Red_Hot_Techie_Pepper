2005-10-27T13:11:00.000Z	Mattias		someone who can help me?
2005-10-27T13:11:00.000Z	Mattias		i had the same problem in gentoo once, but i solved it somehow then in the kernel with something, but i can't remember how :/
2005-10-27T13:11:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	Mattias	did you install the fglrx binary driver?
2005-10-27T13:13:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	Mattias	append " s" to the boot line by pressing "a" in the boot menu.
2005-10-27T13:13:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	Mattias	then, when you get to the console, use dselect to [un] install stuff
2005-10-27T13:15:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	Mattias	use dselect. It'll explain itself to you
2005-10-27T13:16:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	Mattias	here's a tip tho, when you're in the Install screen, after you dismiss the help, press "/" and type something to search by name.
2005-10-27T13:16:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	Mattias	aye
2005-10-27T13:38:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	Mattias	sucky
2005-10-27T15:15:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	Mattias	depends on the computer and card. I know it worked fine for me.
2005-10-27T15:15:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	Mattias	also, fglrx may have certain distribution restrictions.
2005-10-27T15:16:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	Mattias	synaptic
2005-10-27T15:17:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	Mattias	otherwise, compile from source
2005-10-28T16:26:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	Mattias	have you tried?
2005-10-28T16:25:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	Mattias	gtkpod is a good starting place
2005-10-28T16:26:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	Mattias	it should do that by default
2005-10-28T16:26:00.000Z	[Chameleon] 	Mattias	you might need an entry in /etc/fstab first
