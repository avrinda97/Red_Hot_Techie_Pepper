2006-08-29T05:28:00.000Z	jhb		hi *. I have enough space for ubunut on my x31, I already run windows and debian. I would like to install ubuntu, have no cdrom, no floppy. What to do?
2006-08-29T05:28:00.000Z	ladydoor	jhb	do you have usb?
2006-08-29T05:29:00.000Z	jhb	ladydoor	not really
2006-08-29T05:29:00.000Z	jhb	ladydoor	as in: never managed to boot from my usb stick
2006-08-29T05:29:00.000Z	ladydoor	jhb	ah. sorry, no idea then
2006-08-29T05:29:00.000Z	jhb	ladydoor	maybe I could use my usb backup harddisk?
2006-08-29T05:30:00.000Z	jhb	ladydoor	if I get it to run, just look under usb installation?
2006-08-29T05:30:00.000Z	jhb	ladydoor	I assume?

2006-08-29T05:31:00.000Z	ladydoor	jhb	can you netboot somehow? or is there a way to boot an iso on your computer?
2006-08-29T05:32:00.000Z	jhb	ladydoor	I will have to to the bios to check on that
2006-08-29T05:32:00.000Z	ladydoor	jhb	oh
