2007-06-17T09:33:00.000Z	kanzie_		Im getting "Permission denied" when trying to access my ntfs-mounted drive. Can someone help me trace the source of the error?
2007-06-17T09:34:00.000Z	Lilacor	kanzie_	what happens when you mount your drive manually?
2007-06-17T09:36:00.000Z	kanzie_	Lilacor	nothing, it does not complain or anything. I might do something wrong though, just typing mount /dev/sdb1 /media/sdb1 where the media-sdb1 is a unounted empty dir
2007-06-17T09:36:00.000Z	kanzie_	Lilacor	then when trying to access it I get bash: cd: sdb1: Permission denied
2007-06-17T09:36:00.000Z	Lilacor	kanzie_	don't you mean ntfs-3g /dev/sdb1 /media/sdb1?
2007-06-17T09:40:00.000Z	kanzie_	Lilacor	Ok, it says that I need to mount it with force, so Im gonna do that...
2007-06-17T09:40:00.000Z	Lilacor	kanzie_	I wouldn't do that if I were you.
2007-06-17T09:40:00.000Z	kanzie_	Lilacor	no?
2007-06-17T09:40:00.000Z	kanzie_	Lilacor	is it more safe to boot twice into windows?
2007-06-17T09:40:00.000Z	Lilacor	kanzie_	why do you have two logins? get rid of one please
2007-06-17T09:41:00.000Z	Lilacor	kanzie_	because windows can fix it...I hosed part of my NTFS volume doing what you're about to do
2007-06-17T09:41:00.000Z	kanzie_	Lilacor	Shit, yeah that _can not_ happen here! =)
2007-06-17T09:44:00.000Z	Lilacor	kanzie_	it was a mistake
2007-06-17T09:44:00.000Z	Lilacor	kanzie_	boot into windows and fix the volume
2007-06-17T09:44:00.000Z	Lilacor	kanzie_	then mount using ntfs-3g
2007-06-17T09:46:00.000Z	kanzie_	Lilacor	should it be enough just booting or should I manually do chkdsk there?
2007-06-17T09:46:00.000Z	Lilacor	kanzie_	do EXACTLY what it tells you to do, boot, chkdsk /f, reboot, chkdsk /f again and then attempt to mount the volume
2007-06-17T09:48:00.000Z	kanzie_	Lilacor	will do! see you on the other side of chkdsk ;-)
