2010-05-08T22:39:00.000Z	greezmunkey	vianocturna85	I think ##wine
2010-05-08T22:39:00.000Z	vianocturna85	greezmunkey	your the only one in there lol
2010-05-08T22:39:00.000Z	greezmunkey	vianocturna85	#winehq
2010-05-09T18:16:00.000Z	greezmunkey	vianocturna85	It would help to have the exact verbiage of the error. Can you find it in your logs?
2010-05-09T18:17:00.000Z	vianocturna85	greezmunkey	lotroclient.exe[18687]: segfault at 7b9b2f40 ip 7b9b2f40 sp aa8fbf9c error 4 in ntdll.dll.so
2010-05-09T18:20:00.000Z	greezmunkey	vianocturna85	what does lotroclient do?
2010-05-09T18:20:00.000Z	vianocturna85	greezmunkey	well lotro the game has a client built in which doesnt work, so we use pylotro which works fine, after that it switches to the actual game, that crashes
2010-05-09T18:21:00.000Z	greezmunkey	vianocturna85	I assume that is an online game?
2010-05-09T18:21:00.000Z	vianocturna85	greezmunkey	its lord of the rings online, an MMORPG
2010-05-09T18:22:00.000Z	greezmunkey	vianocturna85	the hex in the error translates into 123.155.47.64, it looks like hex for an IP address anyway. Perhaps an error on the server that the client connects to???
2010-05-09T18:22:00.000Z	vianocturna85	greezmunkey	hmmmm let me go research that
2010-05-09T18:23:00.000Z	greezmunkey	vianocturna85	if the client has to download a module from the server in order to operate, it could explain it.
2010-05-09T18:24:00.000Z	vianocturna85	greezmunkey	i installed all the patches, but ill try that again
2010-05-09T18:24:00.000Z	vianocturna85	greezmunkey	my friend was on the same realm at the time so i know the server wasnt down
2010-05-09T18:25:00.000Z	greezmunkey	vianocturna85	that's about all the (help) I can offer, I don't do games - good luck.
2010-05-09T18:26:00.000Z	vianocturna85	greezmunkey	at least you gave me a lead, thanks very much its very much appreciated
2010-05-09T18:26:00.000Z	greezmunkey	vianocturna85	I hope it leads you somewhere productive :)
