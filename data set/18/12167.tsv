2006-07-10T12:51:00.000Z	KingLear		bye
2006-07-10T06:08:00.000Z	KingLear		I came earlier and was guided to a few links regarding upgrade to Dapper from Breezy
2006-07-10T06:08:00.000Z	KingLear		I still have one anomaly remining
2006-07-10T06:08:00.000Z	KingLear		remaining*
2006-07-10T06:09:00.000Z	KingLear		that is when I run upgrade from update manager, even though i  have mounted the Dapper CD, it starts downloading from the internet
2006-07-10T06:09:00.000Z	KingLear		why is it so?
2006-07-10T06:09:00.000Z	Ash-Fox	KingLear	to stay upto date
2006-07-10T06:11:00.000Z	KingLear	Ash-Fox	 I have a Dapper cd Mounted,
2006-07-10T06:12:00.000Z	Ash-Fox	KingLear	did you add the CD as a source?
2006-07-10T06:13:00.000Z	Ash-Fox	KingLear	I suggest you comment out all internet repositories and add your CD as your only source and upgrade from that :)
2006-07-10T06:23:00.000Z	Ash-Fox	KingLear	good luck :)
2006-07-10T06:24:00.000Z	KingLear	Ash-Fox	 this is what I found
2006-07-10T06:25:00.000Z	Ash-Fox	KingLear	you should do a apt-get update whenever you've modified your sources.list
2006-07-10T06:26:00.000Z	Ash-Fox	KingLear	if you didn't do it, then the upgrade probably went a little wrong :P
