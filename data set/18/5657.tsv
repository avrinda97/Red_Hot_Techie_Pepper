2008-09-15T15:48:00.000Z	ickmund		Having some troubles setting up a FakeRaid of 2x1TB under 8.0.4. First run works fine, ie running dmraid and partition the raid. I then reboot, install dmraid again and something goes bad with dmraid. Can't figure out what the problem is.

2008-09-15T15:48:00.000Z	ikonia	ickmund	fakeraid is a terrible technology
2008-09-15T15:48:00.000Z	ikonia	ickmund	it's support is quite poor
2008-09-15T15:50:00.000Z	ickmund	ikonia	I realise that, but besides getting me some new hardware I don't seem to have much of an option as the drives seem too big for my bios. The nvidia raid-utility recognizes them for what they are thou.
2008-09-15T15:51:00.000Z	ikonia	ickmund	have you considered linux software raid
2008-09-15T15:52:00.000Z	ickmund	ikonia	I did at first, but thought that I needed the disks to be recognized in bios for it. If I do use the nvidia raid-array and try to install on sda/sdb grub gives me errors
2008-09-15T15:53:00.000Z	ikonia	ickmund	software raid should work fine
2008-09-15T15:53:00.000Z	ikonia	ickmund	what matters is that the OS see them correctly
2008-09-15T15:53:00.000Z	ickmund	ikonia	I will give it a shot then, thanks
2008-09-15T15:53:00.000Z	ikonia	ickmund	the bios only matters for terrible technologies like fakeraid
2008-09-15T21:11:00.000Z	ikonia	ickmund	is your /boot on a seperate partition / raid set ?
2008-09-15T21:11:00.000Z	ickmund	ikonia	/boot is seperate from the raids, yea
2008-09-15T21:12:00.000Z	ikonia	ickmund	good good,
2008-09-15T21:14:00.000Z	ickmund	ikonia	So if I do have /boot on a separate partition and it still dosen't work, I'm out of luck? :)
2008-09-15T21:14:00.000Z	ikonia	ickmund	not at all
2008-09-15T21:15:00.000Z	ikonia	ickmund	check what the initrd module contains in terms of raid, not sure it contains raid 0
2008-09-15T21:22:00.000Z	ickmund	ikonia	I'm sorry, but I can't seem to even figure out how to check what modules are loaded in initrd?
