2008-06-22T01:53:00.000Z	soundray	Elijah	please keep it on one line. You can download the packages you need in Vista, then copy them to your package cache (/var/cache/apt/archives/)
2008-06-22T01:54:00.000Z	Elijah	soundray	how would i donwload packages in vista? what website
2008-06-22T03:29:00.000Z	soundray	Elijah	it is. Pidgin is more versatile, that's why it's standard
2008-06-22T03:43:00.000Z	soundray	Elijah	Ctrl-Alt-right/left
2008-06-22T03:44:00.000Z	Elijah	soundray	sweet
2008-06-22T03:58:00.000Z	soundray	Elijah	Ctrl-Alt-T
2008-06-22T04:00:00.000Z	Elijah	soundray	does that open it in full screen?
2008-06-22T04:00:00.000Z	Elijah	soundray	that isn't workign
2008-06-22T04:04:00.000Z	soundray	Elijah	I dragged the menu entry to the top panel
2008-06-22T04:05:00.000Z	Elijah	soundray	thanks so much
2008-06-22T04:06:00.000Z	soundray	Elijah	once I've got a terminal open, I use Shift-Ctrl-N to open a new one
2008-06-22T04:06:00.000Z	soundray	Elijah	'sudo apt-get --purge remove linux-image-2.6.24-16-generic' for example should remove the grub entry as well
