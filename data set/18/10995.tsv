2008-06-21T23:43:00.000Z	AquaFox		I wish I could search that website.
2008-06-21T23:43:00.000Z	AquaFox		But my problem is Firefox won't start
2008-06-21T23:44:00.000Z	AquaFox		I said terminal won't start.
2008-06-21T23:44:00.000Z	AquaFox		If you not.
2008-06-21T23:44:00.000Z	AquaFox		*note
2008-06-21T23:45:00.000Z	AquaFox		This only happens after extensive usage.
2008-06-21T23:45:00.000Z	AquaFox		It starts.
2008-06-21T23:45:00.000Z	AquaFox		It crashes at startup
2008-06-21T23:45:00.000Z	AquaFox		Reinstall? That's a way to fix Windows problems not Linux.

2008-06-21T23:45:00.000Z	Flannel	AquaFox	check your logs, unfortunately, without some error message, we don't have a lot to work off of
2008-06-21T23:44:00.000Z	Flannel	AquaFox	w3m is installed.  Also, we'll need some sort of error message or something to go by
2008-06-21T23:44:00.000Z	Flannel	AquaFox	Try running firefox from a terminal, see what errors it gives you
2008-06-21T23:44:00.000Z	AquaFox	Flannel	read it carefully.
2008-06-21T23:45:00.000Z	Flannel	AquaFox	the terminal won't start at all?
2008-06-21T23:46:00.000Z	Flannel	AquaFox	/var/log, also try setting up a new profile for firefox, seeing if that works (move your old one, etc)
2008-06-21T23:47:00.000Z	Flannel	AquaFox	Have you run memtest? checked for hardware issues, etc?
2008-06-21T23:47:00.000Z	AquaFox	Flannel	no hardware issue.
