2005-11-18T11:57:00.000Z	Gecko		Is it possible to use a debian net-install cd to install ubuntu?
2005-11-18T11:57:00.000Z	EdLin	Gecko	no
2005-11-18T11:57:00.000Z	EdLin	Gecko	mixing Debian and Ubuntu repositories will cause breakage.
2005-11-18T11:58:00.000Z	Gecko	EdLin	Well, if you don't add any debian repositories during install and run it from the ubuntu repositories, it should work, right?
2005-11-18T11:58:00.000Z	EdLin	Gecko	no
2005-11-18T11:58:00.000Z	Gecko	EdLin	Why?
2005-11-18T11:58:00.000Z	EdLin	Gecko	the base system is different too.
2005-11-18T11:59:00.000Z	Gecko	EdLin	I see... Well, as a few people have reporting to succesfully upgrading from sid or even sarge to ubuntu, I guess I could upgrade using a very minimal base install?
2005-11-18T12:00:00.000Z	EdLin	Gecko	I wouldn't recommend it.
2005-11-18T12:00:00.000Z	Gecko	EdLin	It seems to be my only possibility to get ubuntu right now...
2005-11-18T12:00:00.000Z	EdLin	Gecko	why?
2005-11-18T12:01:00.000Z	Gecko	EdLin	I don't have an internet connection that can bear the download of the cd, and the only linux I could buy around here was fedora core 2...
2005-11-18T12:01:00.000Z	Gecko	EdLin	the shipIt cd's haven't arrived either
2005-11-18T12:02:00.000Z	EdLin	Gecko	shipit.ubuntu.com. It's how I got my Ubuntu. :-)
2005-11-18T12:02:00.000Z	Gecko	EdLin	I know, I already ordered from there
2005-11-18T12:02:00.000Z	EdLin	Gecko	big rewards for those who wait. ;-)
2005-11-18T12:02:00.000Z	Gecko	EdLin	:)
2005-11-18T12:03:00.000Z	EdLin	Gecko	actually, if you're willing to download a bit over a day, you can download just the single install iso over the net. I did that for Hoary.
