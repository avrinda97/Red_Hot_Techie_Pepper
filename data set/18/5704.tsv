2011-01-22T22:42:00.000Z	alec__		hi folks
2011-01-22T22:43:00.000Z	alec__		oh, i need some support, got an issue i couldn't fix while reading docs...
2011-01-22T22:44:00.000Z	alec__		for i'm a lucky freebsd user, my wife uses ubuntu, and her laptop crashed with some strange error messages
2011-01-22T22:46:00.000Z	alec__		issue: laptop crashed, afer reboot, i got this errormsg: mount: mounting /dev on /root/dev failed: No such file or directory
2011-01-22T22:46:00.000Z	alec__		mount: mounting / sys/ on root/sys failed: No such file or directory
2011-01-22T22:46:00.000Z	alec__		mount: mounting /proc on /root/proc failed: No such file or dirctory
2011-01-22T22:46:00.000Z	alec__		Target filesystem doesn't have requested /sbin/init.
2011-01-22T22:46:00.000Z	alec__		any ideas?
2011-01-22T22:46:00.000Z	alec__		No init found. Try passing init= boot arg
2011-01-22T22:46:00.000Z	dotblank	alec__	that sounds bad..
2011-01-22T22:46:00.000Z	dotblank	alec__	how old is this laptop and are you sure the HD is good
2011-01-22T22:47:00.000Z	alec__	dotblank	ok, winxp sticker on the back, seems pretty old...
2011-01-22T22:48:00.000Z	dotblank	alec__	it justs eems like this error you are getting is because to the root FS got currupt and the kernel is freaking out. I'm surprised you didn't get a VFS kernel panic
2011-01-22T22:49:00.000Z	alec__	dotblank	i have kernel panic after exiting busybox
2011-01-22T22:49:00.000Z	dotblank	alec__	does it say rootfs not found?
2011-01-22T22:49:00.000Z	alec__	dotblank	jep
2011-01-22T22:52:00.000Z	alec__	dotblank	IanWizard, so it seems the filesystem is fscked up and i should do a complete reinstall and backup..
2011-01-22T22:52:00.000Z	dotblank	alec__	try seeing if you can mount the partition within busyboxing or like the the forum post says checking the FS
