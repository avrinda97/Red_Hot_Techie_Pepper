2007-04-20T07:28:00.000Z	rohan		this codec of snd-hda-intel is bad :( it doesnt automatically mute the laptop speakers when i put in a headphone in the socket
2007-04-20T07:28:00.000Z	Chipaca	rohan	snd-hda-intel sucks :(
2007-04-20T07:28:00.000Z	rohan	Chipaca	i agree :(
2007-04-20T07:29:00.000Z	Chipaca	rohan	I finally got mine working decently with 2.6.19 -- I don't know what feisty brings
2007-04-20T07:29:00.000Z	Chipaca	rohan	"decently" still doesn't include a mic, unfortunately
2007-04-20T07:31:00.000Z	rohan	Chipaca	you got that working, when you put a headphone, laptop speakers stop /
2007-04-20T07:32:00.000Z	Chipaca	rohan	yes
2007-04-20T07:32:00.000Z	rohan	Chipaca	GREAT .. please guide me too
2007-04-20T07:32:00.000Z	Chipaca	rohan	I compiled my own kernel :(
2007-04-20T07:32:00.000Z	rohan	Chipaca	but how did it help the issue ?
2007-04-20T07:33:00.000Z	Chipaca	rohan	the driver in 2.6.19 was fixed enough that it worked
2007-04-20T07:33:00.000Z	rohan	Chipaca	what changes did you make in the kernel ?
2007-04-20T07:33:00.000Z	rohan	Chipaca	ok. well i've tried and it doesnt work out of box on arch and ubuntu default kernels
2007-04-20T07:34:00.000Z	Chipaca	rohan	I don't know what kernels are default in feisty
2007-04-20T07:34:00.000Z	rohan	Chipaca	ok, so in 2.6.19 the headphone thing worked out of box ?
2007-04-20T07:34:00.000Z	Chipaca	rohan	did you try the modprobe that PirateHead was told to do?
2007-04-20T07:34:00.000Z	Chipaca	rohan	yes
2007-04-20T07:34:00.000Z	rohan	Chipaca	yes
