2009-05-28T17:16:00.000Z	bullgard4		What document viewer is commonly used to view a document of  MIME type 'application/docbook+xml'?
2009-05-28T17:16:00.000Z	mechdave	bullgard4	Any xml viewer will do it
2009-07-05T13:43:00.000Z	mechdave	bullgard4	At a guess /usr/lib/* is not in your $PATH, try echo $PATH to find out
2009-07-05T13:45:00.000Z	bullgard4	mechdave	In my Ubuntu 9.04 computer $PATH does not include /usr/lib/ . Is it against the rules that an executable has been stored in /usr/lib/ ?
2009-07-05T13:46:00.000Z	mechdave	bullgard4	well that is why which could not find it then... what rules are you speaking of?
2009-07-05T13:48:00.000Z	bullgard4	mechdave	The $PATH variable has been invented to find executables. But it does not find this particular executable. So one could suspect that this executable is wrongly stored.
2009-07-05T13:53:00.000Z	mechdave	bullgard4	I don't have any answers, sorry. I am not experienced in where Gnome puts their executables, maybe try #gnome for more info.
2009-07-05T13:55:00.000Z	bullgard4	mechdave	#gnome is not available in this network. And ##gnome is a lame duck.
2009-07-05T13:56:00.000Z	mechdave	bullgard4	righto
2009-07-05T13:57:00.000Z	mechdave	bullgard4	apparently (according to Google) Gimpnet is the go for #gnome
2009-07-05T13:59:00.000Z	bullgard4	mechdave	Yes. Thank you for your help.
2009-07-05T14:00:00.000Z	mechdave	bullgard4	no worries, not that I was much :)
2009-07-05T14:03:00.000Z	bullgard4	mechdave	Do not denigrate yourself: The discussion was useful for me.
2009-07-05T14:04:00.000Z	mechdave	bullgard4	no worries mate, I am more of a tech kinda bloke in the general systems of UNIX, rather than gui's. I am glad you found it useful ;)
2009-07-05T14:07:00.000Z	bullgard4	mechdave	It was useful indeed. I had forgotten what I once learned: What is $PATH for. But I am not certain if the File Hierarchy Standard applies here. --  So I appreciate that you helped me a bit along my way.
2009-07-05T14:08:00.000Z	mechdave	bullgard4	I am not sure either, another one is Ubuntu meant to conform to the POSIX standard?
2009-07-05T14:11:00.000Z	bullgard4	mechdave	My impression is that Ubuntu is not so eager to cling to the POSIX standard. Ubuntu's main targets are others. For example I dare to say that Debian is more eager to cling to the POSIX standard than Ubuntu, and OpenBSD even more so. --  No, not all programs in the Ubuntu repositories conform to POSIX.
2009-07-05T14:12:00.000Z	mechdave	bullgard4	just reading on the wiki about FHS, it all started with RedHat, Dell and HP, I think Ubuntu loosely follows it (or is that Debian?)
