2008-09-07T10:53:00.000Z	amenado		jbarbero-> also try  sudo lshw -C network and see if the driver is loaded okay
2008-09-07T10:55:00.000Z	jbarbero	amenado	lshw -C network prints info about the Cisco card
2008-09-07T10:56:00.000Z	jbarbero		It identifies the make & model.
2008-09-07T10:56:00.000Z	amenado		jbarbero-> and the driver?
2008-09-07T10:56:00.000Z	jbarbero		Sorry?
2008-09-07T10:56:00.000Z	jbarbero	amenado	how would I check that?
2008-09-07T10:57:00.000Z	amenado		jbarbero-> same command, look at the results carefully
2008-09-07T10:58:00.000Z	jbarbero	amenado	there is no 'configuration:' entry (the configuration entry for eth0 has the word 'driver' in it)
2008-09-07T10:59:00.000Z	amenado		jbarbero-> can you paste in pastebin the results of your sudo lshw -C network
2008-09-07T11:01:00.000Z	jbarbero	amenado	http://pastebin.com/m106a249b
2008-09-07T11:03:00.000Z	amenado		jbarbero-> you dont have the driver for your cisco 340 loaded
2008-09-07T11:03:00.000Z	jbarbero	amenado	right, and how would I got about loading it? I guess it's not automatic
2008-09-07T11:04:00.000Z	amenado		jbarbero-> i guess first thing is find out which chip that card uses and load it, or maybe use ndiswrapper?
2008-09-07T11:04:00.000Z	jbarbero	amenado	I'll look into it and come back if I'm stuck
2008-09-07T11:23:00.000Z	jbarbero	amenado	I found a thread with the info! http://ubuntu-utah.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=409247 thanks, I found it after searching with lshw network in my search terms
2008-09-07T11:23:00.000Z	jbarbero	amenado	it's all fixed, it was an obscure bug but easy to fix
2008-09-07T11:25:00.000Z	amenado	jbarbero	cool..just curious what was the lil bug about?
2008-09-07T13:09:00.000Z	jbarbero	amenado	sorry, I had had to go. The bug was a conflict between an AES-related kernel module and the airo kernel module. Blocking the module and rebooting fixed it.
