2009-11-27T15:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kilnux	 because they dont want to bother? they woud rather sell you  stuff they make a profit on.
2009-11-27T15:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kilnux	 to to the local book stores and they are in all sorts of computer magazines. Or often public libraries have them

2009-11-27T15:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kilnux	 i wouldent buy any.
2009-11-27T15:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kilnux	 linux is not windows.. Im not even sure there are any comercial AV programs out for linux. ( i imagine ther are some but they are for scanning windows files)
2009-11-27T15:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kilnux	 if you want one. theres clamav, and avg has a linux version i recall.
2009-11-27T16:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	kilnux	 but they are designed to scan your windows systems/files for infections - not linux normally
