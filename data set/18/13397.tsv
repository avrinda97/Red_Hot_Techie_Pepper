2005-11-24T12:17:00.000Z	plus-V-ducky		Does anyone know if Ubuntu 'hibernate' (suspend-to-disk) will allow me to boot another partition after hibernating and then still resume?
2005-11-24T12:18:00.000Z	psusi	plus-V-ducky	if the OS on the other partition does not touch any of the partitions the hibernated one has open... sure
2005-11-24T12:19:00.000Z	plus-V-ducky	psusi	are you sure that Ubuntu S2D doesn't write anything int he boot sector or partition tables that may conflict with another os?
2005-11-24T12:20:00.000Z	psusi	plus-V-ducky	yes... it just writes the contents of memory out to swap... so if you want to resume windows... that's fine, as long as you didn't have any of your windows partitions mounted when you hibernate ubuntu
2005-11-24T12:21:00.000Z	plus-V-ducky	psusi	I share a single swap partition with different Linuxes(spel?)...
2005-11-24T12:22:00.000Z	psusi	plus-V-ducky	then don't try to boot those linuxes when you hibernate
2005-11-24T12:23:00.000Z	plus-V-ducky	psusi	what if the swapspace is less than my RAM?
2005-11-24T12:23:00.000Z	psusi	plus-V-ducky	it does not matter... when you hibernate, the ram is written to the swap partition... most likely another linux install you try to boot will refuse to touch the swap partition because the signature will be changed... unless that installation is also configured to resume
2005-11-24T12:27:00.000Z	plus-V-ducky	psusi	it also sets a switch in the GRUB bootloader to pass an argument to vmlinuz (or in an init script perhaps?) does it not?
2005-11-24T12:27:00.000Z	psusi	plus-V-ducky	what's that?  I set up my grun to pass the resume= parameter to point the system to my swap partition
2005-11-24T12:28:00.000Z	psusi	plus-V-ducky	it would break the resume, yes
2005-11-24T12:28:00.000Z	plus-V-ducky	psusi	can I tell Ubuntu to write the file somewhere else and just set it -ro?
2005-11-24T12:29:00.000Z	psusi	plus-V-ducky	I think you can use a swap file instead of a swap partition... never tried it though
2005-11-24T12:29:00.000Z	plus-V-ducky	psusi	but could it cause arbitrary system calls to exec in a way that would actually hurt Ubuntu in a persistent sense?
2005-11-24T12:30:00.000Z	psusi	plus-V-ducky	no... not in a persistent sense... it will just bust the resume
2005-11-24T12:30:00.000Z	plus-V-ducky	psusi	something like WinBlows hiberfil.sys would be _suite_
2005-11-24T12:32:00.000Z	plus-V-ducky	psusi	does Ubuntu run a CRC (or any other integrity check) on the hiberfile?
2005-11-24T12:33:00.000Z	psusi	plus-V-ducky	yes... if it is clobbered by the other install, the resume will simply fail and ubuntu will boot up normally
