2010-11-06T02:44:00.000Z	littlegirl	Akuma_s	In case nobody else has suggested anything, I looked up a couple of the text strings from your error and it doesn't look good: http://www.google.com/search?client=ubuntu&channel=fs&q=Add.+Sense%3A+Unrecovered+read+error+-+auto+reallocate+failed&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8 and http://www.google.com/search?client=ubuntu&channel=fs&q=EXT3-fs%3A+can%27t+read+group+descriptor+1&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8
2010-11-06T02:46:00.000Z	Akuma_s		I know littlegirl... and looking for options about it..
2010-11-06T02:46:00.000Z	Akuma_s		Im looking for options about it
2010-11-06T02:47:00.000Z	Akuma_s	littlegirl	This happened right after I format the partition to ext4
2010-11-06T02:47:00.000Z	Akuma_s		So, be careful with it
2010-11-06T02:48:00.000Z	littlegirl	Akuma_s	I'm not sure if it could be reporting the error wrong, but in the event that it's not, I'd definitely back up everything I could.
2010-11-06T02:48:00.000Z	littlegirl	Akuma_s	Ah, then it might be a conflict of some sort if you still have some ext3 stuff. Do you?
2010-11-06T02:48:00.000Z	Akuma_s	littlegirl	Yeaph, is what I thought
2010-11-06T02:48:00.000Z	littlegirl	Akuma_s	Now you're worrying me. I just installed Ubuntu LTS and am currently using ext4...........
2010-11-06T02:51:00.000Z	littlegirl	Akuma_s	The more pages I read in those results, the worse it looks. Even if that drive is behaving normally right now, I would assume it's about to fail and make sure you have it backed up and a replacement ready. ):
2010-11-06T02:52:00.000Z	Akuma_s	littlegirl	I have 3 partitions in the same HDD with...
2010-11-06T02:52:00.000Z	littlegirl	Akuma_s	Are they backed up?
2010-11-06T02:52:00.000Z	Akuma_s	littlegirl	ext4 and the other 2 are ext3
2010-11-06T02:52:00.000Z	Akuma_s	littlegirl	Not yet :P Im working on it
2010-11-06T02:52:00.000Z	littlegirl	Akuma_s	That *could* be the cause, but it doesn't sound like it from what those pages are saying. I hope you get everything backed up!
2010-11-06T02:53:00.000Z	Akuma_s		Thanks anyway for the support littlegirl
2010-11-06T02:53:00.000Z	Akuma_s		I will try that
2010-11-06T02:53:00.000Z	littlegirl	Akuma_s	I wish it had been better news, but better safe than sorry. Then once you have it backed up you can try stuff and maybe rescue it. (:
