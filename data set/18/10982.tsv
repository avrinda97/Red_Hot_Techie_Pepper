2006-09-27T12:48:00.000Z	morrye		Whats a good editor on ubuntu with nice color coding?
2006-09-27T12:49:00.000Z	Dr_willis	morrye	 vim can do that. :P   You may want to try cream, or some of the emacs.
2006-09-28T08:15:00.000Z	Dr_willis	morrye	 have you fdisked the drive and set the partition tobe ext3 yet?
2006-09-28T08:16:00.000Z	Dr_willis	morrye	 then sudo mkfs.ext3 /dev/hb1 (for example)
2006-09-28T08:16:00.000Z	morrye	Dr_willis	How do I do thiss?
2006-09-28T08:16:00.000Z	Dr_willis	morrye	 gparted may be a easier tool to use if you have to ask how to use fdisk. :)
2006-09-28T08:17:00.000Z	morrye	Dr_willis	How do I unmount a HD its mounted right now
2006-09-28T08:18:00.000Z	Dr_willis	morrye	  umount command. but if its a running system - you may be better off booting a live cd. and doing the formating/fdisking from there.
2006-09-28T08:18:00.000Z	Dr_willis	morrye	 what are you trying to reformat anyway?
2006-09-28T08:18:00.000Z	morrye	Dr_willis	Its a NTFS drive which only contains data.
2006-09-28T08:20:00.000Z	Dr_willis	morrye	 and you want to remove all the data?
2006-09-28T08:20:00.000Z	morrye	Dr_willis	I backed up all the data and want to format the drive as ext3
2006-09-28T08:21:00.000Z	Dr_willis	morrye	 unmount it.. fdisk it, delete/remake the partition as a linux partition, then format it.
2006-09-28T08:22:00.000Z	morrye	Dr_willis	How do I unmount though? I need to do it through terminal or I get a access error.
2006-09-28T08:33:00.000Z	morrye	Dr_willis	That didn't format the drive, what was the software you suggested?
2006-09-28T08:35:00.000Z	Dr_willis	morrye	 gparted
2006-09-28T08:37:00.000Z	morrye	Dr_willis	Is it visual?
2006-09-28T08:38:00.000Z	morrye	Dr_willis	never mind
