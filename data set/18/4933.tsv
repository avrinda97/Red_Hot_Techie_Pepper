2009-01-11T10:37:00.000Z	bluedragon		how to install a theme in cairo from gnome-looks
2009-01-11T10:37:00.000Z	nickrud	bluedragon	I've never heard of cairo themes ....
2009-01-11T10:37:00.000Z	nickrud	bluedragon	you mean a theme called cairo?
2009-01-11T10:38:00.000Z	bluedragon	nickrud	how about this were are programs installed
2009-01-11T10:39:00.000Z	nickrud	bluedragon	I'm at the gnome-look site; how about a link to the one you're talking about
2009-01-11T10:41:00.000Z	nickrud	bluedragon	ah, cairo-dock theme. Like it says, ~/.cairo-doc/themes/
2009-01-11T10:43:00.000Z	nickrud	bluedragon	that's exactly where it's at. ~ is a shortcut for /home/<username>
2009-01-11T10:45:00.000Z	nickrud	bluedragon	then you most likely don't have cairo-dock installed. It's an alternate to the normal gnome panel
2009-01-11T10:45:00.000Z	nickrud	bluedragon	if you do, just create the directories:   mkdir -p ~/.cairo-doc/themes
2009-01-21T10:25:00.000Z	nickrud	bluedragon	if you have never manually edited /etc/* , making sure you have a backup of your home should transfer all your personal settings
2009-01-21T10:26:00.000Z	bluedragon	nickrud	even software
2009-01-21T10:26:00.000Z	nickrud	bluedragon	and   sudo dpkg --get-selections > mypackages.txt , moving that file to the new machine after install, then sudo dpkg --get-selections < mypackages.txt && sudo apt-get dselect-upgrade will restore the software
2009-01-21T10:26:00.000Z	nickrud	bluedragon	that's sudo dpkg --set-selections < mypackages.txt as the second command
2009-01-21T10:27:00.000Z	nickrud	bluedragon	  sudo dpkg --get-selections > mypackages.txt will get a list of all installed software, and save it in a file
2009-01-21T10:28:00.000Z	bluedragon	nickrud	ok got you
2009-01-21T10:28:00.000Z	nickrud	bluedragon	then   sudo dpkg --set-selections < mypackages.txt will read that list, on the new machine, and set them up for installation.  sudo apt-get deselect-upgrade  will perform the actual download and install
