2009-08-28T08:04:00.000Z	^Phantom^		I am having a problem with bluetooth.  I want to transfer a file over to my device, and it does not support ubuntu's "Send file to device..." option.  I then tried to copy it over using the file browser, and it won't let me.  How can I get around this?
2009-08-28T08:06:00.000Z	mdg	^Phantom^	can you use your device to scan your PC and find the file?
2009-08-28T08:11:00.000Z	^Phantom^	mdg	no it can't.
2009-08-28T08:11:00.000Z	mdg	^Phantom^	is this device a phone?
2009-08-28T08:12:00.000Z	^Phantom^	mdg	yes
2009-08-28T08:13:00.000Z	mdg	^Phantom^	your computer's bluetooth see the phone?
2009-08-28T08:16:00.000Z	^Phantom^	mdg	yes. it can.  I have been copying pictures and videos from the phone.
2009-08-28T08:17:00.000Z	mdg	^Phantom^	that would be frustrating to want to go the other way and it doesn't....
2009-08-28T08:18:00.000Z	^Phantom^	mdg	 it is.  is there any way to be able to copy them over?
2009-08-28T08:18:00.000Z	mdg	^Phantom^	last resort would be a usb-type cable... not sure about other ways...
2009-08-28T08:19:00.000Z	mdg	^Phantom^	no SD card either?
2009-08-28T08:21:00.000Z	mdg	^Phantom^	sorry I don't have something more to offer...
2009-08-28T08:23:00.000Z	mdg	^Phantom^	you mean the phone says that?
2009-08-28T08:25:00.000Z	mdg	^Phantom^	perhaps obexpushd could be of help - I have no experience
2009-08-28T08:26:00.000Z	^Phantom^	mdg	 I'll look into it.  Thank you :)
2009-08-28T08:27:00.000Z	mdg	^Phantom^	your welcome!  Good luck! :)
2009-08-28T08:29:00.000Z	mdg	^Phantom^	not sure ...haven't used that one...
2009-08-28T08:32:00.000Z	^Phantom^	mdg	 Very very thank you!  It made the "Send file to device..." option work with my phone!
