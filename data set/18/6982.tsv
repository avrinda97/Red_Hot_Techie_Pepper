2008-02-26T02:41:00.000Z	PriceChild	jexmex	please do not expect support int his channel if you're going to use hardy.
2008-02-26T02:41:00.000Z	jexmex	PriceChild	what are you talking about 3rd party, this is a kernal upgrade to 2.6.24
2008-02-26T02:42:00.000Z	PriceChild	jexmex	that error is from a 3rd party repo.
2008-02-26T02:42:00.000Z	PriceChild	jexmex	we do *NOT* support hardy in this channel.
2008-02-26T02:45:00.000Z	PriceChild	jexmex	so you have installed the hardy kernel?
2008-02-26T02:46:00.000Z	PriceChild	jexmex	so you have installed the hardy kernel? If so then please go to #ubuntu+1

2008-02-26T02:51:00.000Z	PriceChild	jexmex	I have given you that same instruction 3 or 4 times now. Either follow it, or ask for more help if you don't understand.
2008-02-26T02:51:00.000Z	jexmex	PriceChild	I did that
2008-02-26T02:52:00.000Z	PriceChild	jexmex	then thre is no error about it.
2008-02-26T02:59:00.000Z	PriceChild	jexmex	trusting a gpg key, means you implicitly trust the owner of that key. You trust them to do whatever they want to your system.
2008-02-26T03:00:00.000Z	jexmex	PriceChild	gotcha
2008-02-26T03:00:00.000Z	PriceChild	jexmex	read the link there to see what happens when you trust them wrongly.
