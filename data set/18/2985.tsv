2010-01-08T18:37:00.000Z	rayno		Dear all - I need some assistance in changing the date format on my ubuntu server right through the system to dd/MM/yyyy please?
2010-01-08T18:39:00.000Z	erUSUL	rayno	that depends on the locale settings
2010-01-08T18:39:00.000Z	rayno	erUSUL	Can I pvt you please?
2010-01-08T18:40:00.000Z	erUSUL	rayno	better to stay on channel. what locale do you use in the server?
2010-01-08T18:41:00.000Z	erUSUL	rayno	do « echo $LANG »
2010-01-08T18:42:00.000Z	rayno	erUSUL	I use "en_US.UTF-8"
2010-01-08T18:43:00.000Z	erUSUL	rayno	that locale implies date in month/day/year format? why do you want it in the other format ?

2010-01-08T18:44:00.000Z	rayno	erUSUL	I am in another country: Namibia - we use the date format dd/MM/yyyy here.
2010-01-08T18:45:00.000Z	erUSUL	rayno	change the locale to the namibian one. that way date will display the date properly formated for your country (and all other programs too)
2010-01-08T18:45:00.000Z	rayno		that's the thing - there is no locale for Namibia :(
2010-01-08T18:50:00.000Z	erUSUL	rayno	are you sure? maybe it is en_NA.UTF-8 (english namibia? ) ??
2010-01-08T18:50:00.000Z	rayno	erUSUL	 Let me double check
2010-01-08T19:03:00.000Z	erUSUL	rayno	i do not see en_NA in /usr/share/i18n/SUPPORTED maybe you could use some locale that matchs the date preferences of namibia
2010-01-08T19:04:00.000Z	rayno	erUSUL	Will try that - thanks - you've been a great help.
2010-01-08T19:04:00.000Z	erUSUL	rayno	once you have chhosen one this is how you change it http://john.parnefjord.se/node/40
2010-01-08T19:05:00.000Z	rayno	erUSUL	Thanks mate
