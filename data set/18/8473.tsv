2010-01-05T09:53:00.000Z	genii	giiker	hdparm -v             (you'll need hdparm installed)
2010-01-05T09:54:00.000Z	giiker	genii	thankx, i'll try htat now!
2010-01-05T09:55:00.000Z	giiker	genii	the help menu options jsut came up, nothing else...
2010-01-05T09:56:00.000Z	genii	giiker	hdparm -v /dev/sda                   as a for-instance
2010-01-05T09:57:00.000Z	giiker	genii	that di not work either
2010-01-05T09:58:00.000Z	giiker	genii	it says: IO_support    =  0 (default)  readonly      =  0 (off) readahead     = 256 (on) geometry      = 19457/255/63, sectors = 312581808, start = 0
2010-01-05T09:58:00.000Z	giiker	genii	the drive is not mounted yet, do you think that will be the problem?
2010-01-05T09:59:00.000Z	genii	giiker	No. More likely it's due to scsi layer. Probably need sdparm
2010-01-05T10:00:00.000Z	giiker	genii	ok, thanks, first time I see this command!
2010-01-05T10:03:00.000Z	giiker	genii	I run sdparm, but i can't decipher what the numbers mean
2010-01-05T10:05:00.000Z	giiker	genii	would DMA mode considered a caching mode?
2010-01-05T10:06:00.000Z	giiker	genii	the numbers are exit codes for othe scripts
2010-01-05T10:07:00.000Z	genii	giiker	Been a while since I used hdparm/sdparm, it may not be giving the info like bus speed you wanted to find out
2010-01-05T10:09:00.000Z	giiker	genii	will have to try something else then
2010-01-05T10:09:00.000Z	giiker	genii	thanks
