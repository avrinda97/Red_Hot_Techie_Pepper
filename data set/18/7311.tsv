2012-02-28T18:31:00.000Z	orville		good morning folks.
2012-02-28T18:31:00.000Z	orville		does anyone here know how to turn off the reboot notification in ubuntu?
2012-02-28T18:32:00.000Z	orville		I've installed ubuntu in a vps and am not using the kernel.
2012-02-28T18:32:00.000Z	orville		the ubuntu kernel that is.
2012-02-28T18:32:00.000Z	orville		so I don't need to reboot, but that motd notification annoys me :-)
2012-02-28T18:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	orville	i know its a file somewhere, just cant remember where
2012-02-28T18:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	orville	seems like a lot of effort for very little gain
2012-02-28T18:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	orville	I have a clear command at the bottom of ~/.bashrc so when I log in via SSH I get a blank terminal
2012-02-28T18:37:00.000Z	orville	ActionParsnip	seems that way. but this involves byobu not bash.
2012-02-28T18:43:00.000Z	orville	ActionParsnip	 and this is why it's good to learn about your system.
2012-02-28T18:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	orville	i'm learning every day, just as you are
2012-02-28T18:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	orville	dude, I help here nearly every day...
2012-02-28T18:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	orville	I also have one of the highest karmas on launchpad.
2012-02-28T18:48:00.000Z	orville	ActionParsnip	what?
2012-02-28T18:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	orville	well you're talking like I never use Linux before, or am very new...
2012-02-28T18:51:00.000Z	orville	ActionParsnip	no. i'm talking like you shouldn't make assumptions about why people are doing things, or make unhelpful comments like "seems like a lot of effort for very little gain".
2012-02-28T18:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	orville	well it is, the restart message is a single line of text, very easy to ignore...
2012-02-28T18:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	orville	its about feasability too
