2007-12-19T10:14:00.000Z	dbuZer		i cant run win98 in the qemu... the install finished ok, but this don't start... always fail when try to access a floppy
2007-12-19T10:15:00.000Z	Eagleray	dbuZer	have you actually specified the floppy image or device?
2007-12-19T10:16:00.000Z	Eagleray	dbuZer	what are you trying to do?
2007-12-19T10:16:00.000Z	dbuZer	Eagleray	i have a img file... that call win98... i use this to run: #qemu win98
2007-12-19T10:17:00.000Z	Eagleray	dbuZer	you need to specify your floppy there too
2007-12-19T10:17:00.000Z	Eagleray	dbuZer	for example, '# qemu -fda /dev/fda win98.img
2007-12-19T10:17:00.000Z	dbuZer	Eagleray	i think the problem is with the floopy, when qemu try to access the floopy in the so, this fail and freeze the screen... theres a way to disable floopy emulation?
2007-12-19T10:17:00.000Z	dbuZer	Eagleray	ok... i will see here.. wait
2007-12-19T10:19:00.000Z	dbuZer	Eagleray	when booting win98 the terminal show this and stop emulation: FLOPPY ERROR: fdctrl_write_data: unknown command: 0x2e
2007-12-19T10:20:00.000Z	dbuZer	Eagleray	i just tried with this -fda parameter and this has seem my floopy, but the same problem happen
2007-12-19T10:21:00.000Z	dbuZer	Eagleray	in the ctrl + alt + 2 there some option that i can disable the floppy? did you know that?
2007-12-19T10:35:00.000Z	Eagleray	dbuZer	sorry for vanishing there - work called
