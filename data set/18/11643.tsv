2006-06-30T15:14:00.000Z	Lars_G	orcdestroyer	You need to enable it in the init sequence, there are maaany ways to do this
2006-06-30T15:15:00.000Z	Lars_G	orcdestroyer	Basically I'd suggest using a gui helper. to enable it.
2006-06-30T15:30:00.000Z	Lars_G	orcdestroyer	See tty or use mouse in text mode?
2006-06-30T15:31:00.000Z	orcdestroyer	Lars_G	see tty
2006-06-30T15:41:00.000Z	Lars_G	orcdestroyer	--dport not --deport
2006-06-30T15:41:00.000Z	Lars_G	orcdestroyer	and if you'll use ports, you'll need to specify protocol and load protocol settings: -p tcp -m tcp
2006-06-30T15:42:00.000Z	orcdestroyer	Lars_G	thx
2006-06-30T15:44:00.000Z	orcdestroyer	Lars_G	did you know how protocol I use for 553 port ?
2006-06-30T15:45:00.000Z	Lars_G	orcdestroyer	rephraze your question
2006-06-30T15:45:00.000Z	orcdestroyer	Lars_G	wich protocol I use for 553 ?
2006-06-30T15:46:00.000Z	Lars_G	orcdestroyer	What are you sending over 553? It's not listed on my /etc/services
2006-06-30T15:46:00.000Z	Lars_G	orcdestroyer	you seem to be using tcp
2006-06-30T15:47:00.000Z	Lars_G	orcdestroyer	 iptables -A FORWARD -s 10.1.0.0/16 -m tcp -p tcp --dport 553 -j DROP
