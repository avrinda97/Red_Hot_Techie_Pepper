2012-04-14T19:48:00.000Z	oal		When I view 3d content moving fast, it's like a part of the screen moves, then the other part stays still, and then the other also moves. Is that related to vsync (or what it's called)? Nvidia gpu on Ubuntu 11.10.
2012-04-14T19:49:00.000Z	zykotick9	oal	usually vsync (issue is typically called tearing)
2012-04-14T19:49:00.000Z	oal	zykotick9	any settings I can change to prevent it from happening?
2012-04-14T19:50:00.000Z	zykotick9	oal	turn vsync on - typically there is both an nvidia setting and a compiz setting for it (or there used to be in compiz)
2012-04-14T19:50:00.000Z	oal	zykotick9	thanks
2012-04-14T19:51:00.000Z	oal	zykotick9	is that "Sync to VBlank" in the nvidia driver settings? It's already enabled
2012-04-14T19:52:00.000Z	zykotick9	oal	ya - that's the nvidia setting
2012-04-14T19:53:00.000Z	zykotick9	oal	did you say it tearing in 3d?  check the "OpenGL Settings" in nvidia-settings there a "Sync to VBlank" there as well.
2012-04-14T19:53:00.000Z	oal	zykotick9	Sync to Vblank is already checked. I googled tearing and found this http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2010/01/how-to-fix-video-tearing-in-videos-nvidia-ubuntu/ will try it now
2012-04-14T19:54:00.000Z	zykotick9	oal	for videos, be use "X Server XVideo Settings" in nvida-setting already has "Sync to VBlank" then.
2012-04-14T19:56:00.000Z	zykotick9	oal	what video player are you using?  and what VO (Video Output) are you using with that video player?  XV vs GL vs VDPAU might give very different results.
2012-04-14T19:56:00.000Z	oal	zykotick9	I meant 3d as in a 3d game. More specifically webgl
2012-04-14T19:57:00.000Z	zykotick9	oal	webgl, i see.  well, good luck man.
2012-04-14T19:57:00.000Z	oal	zykotick9	is it not related to vsync then?
2012-04-14T19:57:00.000Z	zykotick9	oal	don't have the slightest idea sorry.  good luck.
2012-04-14T19:58:00.000Z	oal	zykotick9	heh, ok, I hope I can find a solution, as it's quite annoying
2012-04-14T20:00:00.000Z	oal	zykotick9	hmm, now I see the CompizConfig says refresh rate is 50 while my monitors are 60Hz. Does it make sense to also set compiz to 60?
2012-04-14T20:01:00.000Z	zykotick9	oal	i'm not sure man...
