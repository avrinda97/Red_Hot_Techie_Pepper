2011-01-13T00:27:00.000Z	turtle153		i need help with a tablet
2011-01-13T00:28:00.000Z	turtle153		i followed some instructions and i was told to put the driver file in /lib/modules/2.6.35-24-generic/kernel/drivers/input/tablet but i dunno how to set the driver
2011-01-13T00:28:00.000Z	WaltherFI	turtle153	which tablet?
2011-01-13T00:29:00.000Z	WaltherFI	turtle153	there are native drivers in the repos
2011-01-13T00:29:00.000Z	WaltherFI	turtle153	search for wacom in the synaptic
2011-01-13T00:30:00.000Z	WaltherFI	turtle153	mouse right- mark for installation - commit changes
2011-01-13T00:32:00.000Z	WaltherFI	turtle153	logout login
2011-01-13T00:33:00.000Z	WaltherFI	turtle153	also, usually things like tablets don't need separate drivers, for me it worked out of the box
2011-01-13T00:33:00.000Z	WaltherFI	turtle153	you should install the driver from the repo's , not any driver files should be needed
2011-01-13T00:34:00.000Z	WaltherFI	turtle153	so what drivers have you installed and how?
2011-01-13T00:35:00.000Z	WaltherFI	turtle153	remove all those, trust in the repositories
2011-01-13T00:36:00.000Z	WaltherFI	turtle153	for the drivers you have installed yourself, yes
2011-01-13T00:40:00.000Z	turtle153	WaltherFI	it kinda works now
2011-01-13T00:41:00.000Z	turtle153	WaltherFI	at the login screen i could hover the pen just for a second but now ive still got to press it against the tablet to move the cursor
2011-01-13T00:41:00.000Z	WaltherFI	turtle153	preferences - mouse anything there?
2011-01-13T00:42:00.000Z	WaltherFI	turtle153	very interesting
2011-01-13T00:42:00.000Z	WaltherFI	turtle153	google for your model + ubuntu?
