2006-06-15T12:24:00.000Z	eXistenZ	Cin	There is something weird that happened. After I ssh, and type my username, it takes time for the password request to appear.
2006-06-15T12:24:00.000Z	eXistenZ	Cin	very weird indeed!
2006-06-15T12:25:00.000Z	Cin	eXistenZ	aye that is weird.
2006-06-15T12:25:00.000Z	eXistenZ	Cin	How can I see whether there is some error or something?
2006-06-15T12:27:00.000Z	Cin	eXistenZ	is there an ftp log in /var/log/?
2006-06-15T12:27:00.000Z	eXistenZ	Cin	nope
2006-06-15T12:27:00.000Z	eXistenZ	Cin	I checked tha auth.log, nothing wrong
2006-06-15T12:28:00.000Z	Cin	eXistenZ	I'm quite new to Linux services, mate. I have seen that before though, it takes like... 5 seconds for it to login? Always wondered what that is.
2006-06-15T12:29:00.000Z	eXistenZ	Cin	Although I'm logging on a lan. It worked well, until once I had a router crash
2006-06-15T12:29:00.000Z	Cin	eXistenZ	maybe it needs a restart? (The service)
2006-06-15T12:30:00.000Z	eXistenZ	Cin	what command restarts the system? shutdown -a ?
2006-06-15T12:30:00.000Z	Cin	eXistenZ	well, 'reboot'. But you should just be able to type a command to restart the ftp service.
2006-06-15T12:31:00.000Z	Cin	eXistenZ	/etc/init.d/ftp restart -- does that work?
2006-06-15T12:31:00.000Z	eXistenZ	Cin	I restarted the system. That's okay.
2006-06-15T12:31:00.000Z	Cin	eXistenZ	I don't have an FTP server installed, so I can't test it.
2006-06-15T12:31:00.000Z	Cin	eXistenZ	hehe.
2006-06-15T12:31:00.000Z	eXistenZ	Cin	even the ssh
