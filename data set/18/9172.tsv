2007-07-25T07:31:00.000Z	nickrud	linxuz3r	try apt-cache policy compiz-gnome and apt-cache policy compiz-plugins, what you're looking for is orgin: probably they come from different repos and conflict
2007-12-23T05:38:00.000Z	nickrud	linxuz3r	your cpu fan maybe?
2007-12-23T05:40:00.000Z	nickrud	linxuz3r	maybe the bits are trying to escape?  (sorry, not a clue :)
2009-01-17T07:14:00.000Z	nickrud	linxuz3r	no, vfat is fat16 or fat32 :)
2009-01-17T07:12:00.000Z	nickrud	linxuz3r	are you copying to an ntfs/vfat partition?
2009-01-17T07:12:00.000Z	linxuz3r	nickrud	yes
2009-01-17T07:13:00.000Z	nickrud	linxuz3r	those don't use unix file permissions, it's normal
2009-01-17T07:13:00.000Z	nickrud	linxuz3r	using vfat as sort of a backup?
2009-01-17T07:14:00.000Z	nickrud	linxuz3r	same thing for what we're talking about
2009-01-17T07:15:00.000Z	linxuz3r	nickrud	do i need to preserve permission and owners?
2009-01-17T07:15:00.000Z	nickrud	linxuz3r	it's never a bad idea; if you're just storing the files on the vfat for later return and use in ext3 __dean__ has the best advice
2009-01-17T07:21:00.000Z	linxuz3r	nickrud	how do i tar it properly
2009-01-17T07:22:00.000Z	nickrud	linxuz3r	I cd into the dir I'm saving in and   tar cf <filename>.tar /path/to/dir/to/archive
2009-01-17T07:23:00.000Z	linxuz3r	nickrud	whats the difference between .tar and .tar.gz .tar.xy xz and so on?
2009-01-17T07:37:00.000Z	nickrud	linxuz3r	right click the file, open with archive manager
2009-01-17T07:37:00.000Z	linxuz3r	nickrud	but it does not show owner and permissions
2009-01-17T07:39:00.000Z	nickrud	linxuz3r	bummer, you're right
2009-02-20T10:47:00.000Z	nickrud	linxuz3r	duplex?
