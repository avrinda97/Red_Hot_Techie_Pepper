2006-12-26T10:53:00.000Z	linux_kid	tim167	how do you do that star thingy?
2006-12-26T10:54:00.000Z	tim167	linux_kid	type "/me" before "is testing irc commands"
2006-12-26T10:54:00.000Z	tim167	linux_kid	http://www.ircbeginner.com/ircinfo/ircc-commands.html
2007-02-14T09:41:00.000Z	linux_kid	tim167	yes, it does
2007-02-14T09:42:00.000Z	tim167	linux_kid	so i can do this: make new partition on my drive which has a broken ubuntu on it, and install a new ubuntu in new partition ?
2007-02-14T09:43:00.000Z	linux_kid	tim167	why not just reformat broken ubuntu and install on newly formatted partition?
2007-02-14T09:44:00.000Z	tim167	linux_kid	i have no empty diskspace to make a complete backup, i want to keep as much on it as possible
2007-02-14T09:44:00.000Z	linux_kid	tim167	what you previously stated should work fine
2007-02-14T09:46:00.000Z	tim167	linux_kid	i'm going to try that, i'm looking at fdisk now, or do you recommend installing gparted ?
2007-02-14T09:47:00.000Z	linux_kid	tim167	you have to use a liveboot cd to change partitions
2007-02-14T09:47:00.000Z	tim167	linux_kid	ubuntu live cd any good for that ?
2007-02-14T09:48:00.000Z	linux_kid	tim167	yes
2007-02-14T09:50:00.000Z	tim167	linux_kid	rebooting now, there is a nested live cd (dynebolic) on this hd, will ubuntu install cd's repartitioning tool see this or regard it as empty space ?
2007-02-14T09:51:00.000Z	tim167	linux_kid	i spose its just inside the main linux partition, because i can see it on /mnt/hd1/1/dyne
2007-02-14T09:51:00.000Z	linux_kid	tim167	excuse me, but what is on /mnt/hd1/1/dyne ?
2007-02-14T09:52:00.000Z	tim167	linux_kid	a 'nested' live cd named dynebolic (www.dynebolic.org)
2007-02-14T09:53:00.000Z	tim167	linux_kid	this allows it to be booted from hd instead of cd
2007-02-14T09:53:00.000Z	linux_kid	tim167	im not very knowledgable in embedded live cd's, sorry
