2010-07-28T14:33:00.000Z	metalgeek		Hi, Have been trying to network two ubuntu pcs for two days now and getting nowhere, Am nub so probably something simple that i don't know but i'm pulling my hair out, Please Help!
2010-07-28T14:33:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	metalgeek	Can you ping the one machine from the other?
2010-07-28T14:36:00.000Z	metalgeek	YankDownUnder	No,
2010-07-28T14:36:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	metalgeek	Give that a shot firstly mate
2010-07-28T14:37:00.000Z	metalgeek	YankDownUnder	there not connected
2010-07-28T14:37:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	metalgeek	Um...right...then I've misinterpreted your situation
2010-07-28T14:37:00.000Z	metalgeek	YankDownUnder	am trying to create a wireless adhoc network between netbook and desktop
2010-07-28T14:38:00.000Z	metalgeek	YankDownUnder	I cant even get the wireless up
2010-07-28T14:38:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	metalgeek	You might look through the settings in Network Manager to be sure
2010-07-28T14:39:00.000Z	metalgeek	YankDownUnder	Ive tried everything that my limited experiece allows, :)
2010-07-28T14:40:00.000Z	metalgeek	YankDownUnder	It makes no sense to me. I can at least get my netbook to connect to my windows wireless network but then i can't ping the other machines either

2010-07-28T15:26:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	metalgeek	Something you can try is to connect the machine to ethernet, and do System => Administration => Hardware Drivers => check to see if any drivers for the dongle are found (of course, you have to have the dongle IN at the time)
2010-07-28T15:27:00.000Z	metalgeek	YankDownUnder	don't have ethernet
2010-07-28T15:27:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	metalgeek	/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf
2010-07-28T15:29:00.000Z	metalgeek	YankDownUnder	opened the file but can't see the drivers that i am looking for, dose this mean that they are not blacklisted at all?
2010-07-28T15:31:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	metalgeek	How's about this - when you boot with the liveCD, does the wireless work?
2010-07-28T15:32:00.000Z	metalgeek	YankDownUnder	hold the phone, i'll try, back in a min
