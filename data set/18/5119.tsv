2008-12-08T13:03:00.000Z	_2	piklesonfire	if ifup doesn't do it, ifconfig without any ip prolly wont either,  but yeah
2008-12-08T13:04:00.000Z	piklesonfire	_2	very true. but if the interfaces file is intact, and it's static, or gets it from dhcp, it should.
2008-12-08T13:04:00.000Z	_2	piklesonfire	as should ifup
2008-12-08T13:05:00.000Z	piklesonfire	_2	agreed, just mentioning another way.. lol
2008-12-08T13:35:00.000Z	_2	piklesonfire	just a note on apt-file   it's good for packages not installed,  but for people with slower connections, the database takes time to update, and if the intent is to search within packages on the system dpkg can do that.
2008-12-08T13:35:00.000Z	piklesonfire	_2	ah, sorry, thank you for the insight.
2008-12-08T14:08:00.000Z	piklesonfire	_2	at least if luddite moves it to the trash can she can restore it... i'm with you, i advise strongly against it
2008-12-08T14:11:00.000Z	_2	piklesonfire	no.   cat /dev/zero > /dev/hdd    :)))
