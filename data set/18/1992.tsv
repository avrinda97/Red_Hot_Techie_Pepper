2010-09-18T23:53:00.000Z	frank63		i used sudo apt-get --purge remove nvidia* to remove prev drivers (I followed instruction on ubuntu help pages)
2010-09-18T23:55:00.000Z	frank63		I've also remove and blacklisted nouveaut
2010-09-18T23:56:00.000Z	frank63		but not sure about the sequence: at a given moment xorg wasn starting anymore
2010-09-18T23:56:00.000Z	frank63		so I reinstalled xorg and then nvidia-current again
2010-09-18T23:57:00.000Z	frank63		I 'm currently running the drivers from nvidia (256-53)
2010-09-18T23:58:00.000Z	frank63		graphics card is the 8600GT
2010-09-18T23:58:00.000Z	frank63		it was working fine 3 or 4 month ago, with compiz etc
2010-09-18T23:58:00.000Z	xbonesx	frank63	i have that same card
2010-09-18T23:58:00.000Z	xbonesx	frank63	what laptop do you have?
2010-09-19T00:00:00.000Z	xbonesx	frank63	what version of ubuntu are you running?
2010-09-19T00:01:00.000Z	xbonesx	frank63	you probably need to run the apt-get to have the current nvidia driver redownloaded and installed
2010-09-19T00:02:00.000Z	xbonesx	frank63	one sec ill get the line for you
2010-09-19T00:04:00.000Z	xbonesx	frank63	how are you trying to install the driver for nvidia?
2010-09-19T00:05:00.000Z	xbonesx	frank63	are you using hardware drivers GUI to get it or synaptic or apt-get?
2010-09-19T00:07:00.000Z	xbonesx	frank63	?
2010-09-19T00:18:00.000Z	frank63	xbonesx	probably I missed your question. I installed nvidia 195 using apt-get,  since that didn worked, I then removed them, quite likely didn reboot and installe nvidia 256 driver from it's own semi-graphic tool
2010-09-19T00:19:00.000Z	xbonesx	frank63	have you gotten it to work yet then?
2010-09-19T00:30:00.000Z	xbonesx	frank63	i dont think your installing the correct driver, one sec ill check my version
