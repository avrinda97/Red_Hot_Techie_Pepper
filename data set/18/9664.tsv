2007-05-02T13:45:00.000Z	robert_		bah
2007-05-02T13:45:00.000Z	robert_		nobody seems to be paying much attention to me
2007-05-02T13:47:00.000Z	robert_		[02:08:29]  <Leo Kitten> But I want to know what I'll break if I use a stock 2.6.21
2007-05-02T13:49:00.000Z	robert_		heh k
2007-05-02T13:49:00.000Z	rohinton	robert_	You should be able to download the kernel and build and test it...
2007-05-02T13:50:00.000Z	robert_		that's what I advised her to do
2007-05-02T13:50:00.000Z	robert_		ah
2007-05-02T13:50:00.000Z	robert_		here she is
2007-05-02T13:50:00.000Z	robert_		anyway
2007-05-02T13:51:00.000Z	robert_		it's really for Ashiki though
2007-05-02T13:54:00.000Z	robert_		what will break if you use a stock kernel?
2007-05-02T13:54:00.000Z	rohinton	robert_	I think it depends with what tool chain it was built with - if you are talking a pre-built kernel.
2007-05-02T13:56:00.000Z	robert_	rohinton	what about with feisty?
2007-05-02T13:59:00.000Z	rohinton	robert_	Maybe do a second install and then replace the kernel there... that way you have something to fall back on
2007-05-02T13:59:00.000Z	robert_	rohinton	that's what I suggested Ashiki do
2007-05-02T14:00:00.000Z	rohinton	robert_	this is probably not the right forum to ask this question... maybe ubuntu+1
2007-05-02T14:01:00.000Z	rohinton	robert_	maybe also look at sidux....
2007-05-02T14:02:00.000Z	rohinton	robert_	I assume you want to look at new kernel features? - what's your objective? apart from fun!
