2011-04-04T06:19:00.000Z	mickster04	Koritsa	ubuntu is a user system mainly, not a dev suystem, but it is more than capable.
2011-04-04T06:21:00.000Z	mickster04	Koritsa	then it'll take you like 15 mins or so, you just have to work out what you need, that can be slightly ctime consuming, but just use synaptics package manager or apt-get interminal
2011-04-04T06:29:00.000Z	mickster04	Koritsa	one is LTS
2011-04-04T08:11:00.000Z	mickster04	Koritsa	look for lamp?

2011-04-04T08:13:00.000Z	mickster04	Koritsa	ok so search for apache, what does it find?
2011-04-04T08:16:00.000Z	mickster04	Koritsa	in terminal type in sudo apt-get install apache2
2011-04-04T08:34:00.000Z	mickster04	Koritsa	sudo su to become root user, but why not just do sudo <<command>>
