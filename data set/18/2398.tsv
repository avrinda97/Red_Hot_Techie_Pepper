2010-05-24T23:35:00.000Z	CbIP		Hi all! Does anybody know, when I try to turn on my computer without monitor, the xserver or something (I don't know what without monitor) doesn't start and I can't connect via VNC.
2010-05-24T23:35:00.000Z	CbIP		Also, the space button doesn't work while VNC is connected...
2010-05-24T23:35:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	CbIP	what vnc app are you using?
2010-05-24T23:36:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	CbIP	plus vnc is primarily used with a screen, ssh is more suited to cli
2010-05-24T23:36:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	CbIP	the app isn't started until gnome is unlike a daemon, the start-up items aren't started without gnome desktop
2010-05-24T23:39:00.000Z	CbIP	aeon-ltd	So how do I enable gnome startup as a daemon?
2010-05-24T23:39:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	CbIP	you can't, but there is probably a vnc app that can be loaded as a daemon, plus why would you want to use vnc without Xorg?
2010-05-24T23:43:00.000Z	CbIP	aeon-ltd	Sorry, I'm newbie in Linux-systems. I've used Debian,and somehow I could connect to gnome VNC without monitor
2010-05-24T23:44:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	CbIP	you mean physically without monitor or without Xorg?
2010-05-24T23:44:00.000Z	CbIP	aeon-ltd	Yes, without a physicall monitor
2010-05-24T23:45:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	CbIP	i don't see why that wouldn't work, do you login, or is it set to auto?
2010-05-24T23:46:00.000Z	CbIP	aeon-ltd	It was set to auto
2010-05-24T23:46:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	CbIP	and now?
2010-05-24T23:47:00.000Z	CbIP	aeon-ltd	I don't know :) I remember, that I installed "vncserver" too, but I stopped it. May be I was connected to "vncserver", not to gnome vnc...
2010-05-24T23:47:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	CbIP	probably
2010-05-24T23:48:00.000Z	CbIP	aeon-ltd	OK, then I'm going to install "vncserver". Thank you very much!
2010-05-24T23:48:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	CbIP	gald i could help
2010-05-24T23:50:00.000Z	CbIP	aeon-ltd	One more question, if possible :) When I connected to gnome VNC my space button doesn't work... Also I had the same problem with Debian.
