2009-08-30T03:02:00.000Z	_Trinity_		hi all
2009-08-30T03:02:00.000Z	sebsebseb	_Trinity_	hi
2009-08-30T03:03:00.000Z	sebsebseb	_Trinity_	the  alternate is instead of  the desktop, and the server is for  proper servers
2009-08-30T03:04:00.000Z	sebsebseb	_Trinity_	 yes I meant since it has a proper server kernel, unlike the desktop/alternate  where you can also run a server
2009-09-02T10:27:00.000Z	sebsebseb	_Trinity_	why Dapper?
2009-09-02T10:28:00.000Z	sebsebseb	_Trinity_	if you can't repo update, why not do a clean install and put on at least 8.04 on?
2009-09-02T10:29:00.000Z	sebsebseb	_Trinity_	oh on a Mac, you can  get later versions onto Mac, but I don't  know how to put Linux onto a Mac, since don't have one
2009-09-02T10:32:00.000Z	sebsebseb	_Trinity_	well good luck
2009-09-02T10:36:00.000Z	sebsebseb	_Trinity_	ok well,   Yellow Dog Linux is meant to be good on Mac as well
2009-09-02T10:37:00.000Z	sebsebseb	_Trinity_	oh ok, but why not btw ?
2009-09-02T10:37:00.000Z	sebsebseb	_Trinity_	yeah  exactly,  I thought about Debian,  but stable means old when it comes to Debian
2009-09-02T10:39:00.000Z	sebsebseb	_Trinity_	ah ok
2009-09-02T10:40:00.000Z	sebsebseb	_Trinity_	sure, plus it's off topic in here
2009-09-02T10:40:00.000Z	sebsebseb	_Trinity_	in pm it's ok, but I am going soon anyway
2009-09-05T04:28:00.000Z	sebsebseb	_Trinity_	Intel stuff is fixed in Ubuntu 9.10  released at the end of October
2009-09-05T04:29:00.000Z	_Trinity_	sebsebseb	and it would solve freezing problems
2009-09-05T04:29:00.000Z	sebsebseb	_Trinity_	oh you have come from Debian?
2009-09-05T04:30:00.000Z	sebsebseb	_Trinity_	ok
