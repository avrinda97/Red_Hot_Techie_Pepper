2009-10-16T15:33:00.000Z	jerknextdoor		is there a way to make it so when i remove a program it automatically deletes the .folder in my home folder?
2009-10-16T15:34:00.000Z	Slart	jerknextdoor	try using "completely remove" or apt-get purge
2009-10-16T15:35:00.000Z	jerknextdoor	Slart	thanks.  i'm trying to free up diskspace and just realized i have a bunch of stuff i no longer have installed still there.
2009-10-16T15:35:00.000Z	Slart	jerknextdoor	if you start up synaptic you can select "residual config" in one of the filters on the left side.. then you'll see software that still has some extra files left behind.. and also remove those extra files
2009-10-16T15:36:00.000Z	jerknextdoor	Slart	oh yeah.  i remember that from something else i did.  i forgot that existed.  i'll hit that up.  thanks
2009-10-16T15:42:00.000Z	jerknextdoor	Slart	there are several things that synaptic didnt catch.  i should have no problem just deleting them by hand right?
2009-10-16T15:44:00.000Z	Slart	jerknextdoor	I can't imagine that there would be a problem deleting config files for software that isn't installed any more.. but perhaps.. just to be sure.. move the files somewhere else.. reboot.. see if anything explodes.. if it's ok then you can remove them
2009-10-16T15:44:00.000Z	jerknextdoor	Slart	that was my next step.  thanks.
2009-10-16T16:14:00.000Z	jerknextdoor	Slart	we might have been slighly off on that assumption.  well, it was my fault really.  i moved those folders to my trash initially because it was easy and then rethought that and tried to restore them, but something go effed up.
2009-10-16T16:15:00.000Z	Slart	jerknextdoor	oh.. so the files were actually needed? and now they are gone?
2009-10-16T16:17:00.000Z	jerknextdoor	Slart	i'm not 100% what's going on.  i think everything got restored like it should have except for one file.  which i sent to trash by accident and then restored.  it's a .cfg file for a todo.txt-cli script and now it says it can't write to the folder it's supposed to.  i'm thinking that trashing it screwed up the permissions?
2009-10-16T16:18:00.000Z	Slart	jerknextdoor	hmm.. I guess that might be possible.. but permissions should be pretty easy to fix
2009-10-16T16:19:00.000Z	jerknextdoor	Slart	yeah.  i'm just not seeing what's wrong with them.
2009-10-16T16:21:00.000Z	Slart	jerknextdoor	hmm.. have you checked the permissions for that folder it tries to write to?
2009-10-16T16:22:00.000Z	jerknextdoor	Slart	yeah.  i'm troubleshooting everything right now.  it takes a minute cause something isn't right here.  i dont know how that folder would have been touched at all.
2009-10-16T16:27:00.000Z	jerknextdoor	Slart	weird.  wasn't permissions at all.  when the file got restored a line was missing or something.  i just updated an old backup of it and it works again.  such a strange error from that.
2009-10-16T16:27:00.000Z	Slart	jerknextdoor	oh.. that's odd.. perhaps there were several versions of that file in the trash can or something..
2009-10-16T16:30:00.000Z	jerknextdoor	Slart	no idea.  i'm just gonna be glad for once that text editor saves those ~backups that usually annoy the crap out of me.
