2007-12-10T08:52:00.000Z	earlmred		hmm
2007-12-10T08:52:00.000Z	earlmred		"Error 17: Cannot mount selected partition"
2007-12-10T08:53:00.000Z	intelikey	earlmred	bad info in the /boot/grub/menu.lst or /boot/grub/devices.map    is normally the cause of that
2007-12-10T09:18:00.000Z	intelikey	earlmred	maybe you better    man dd
2007-12-10T09:01:00.000Z	intelikey	earlmred	yep   get grub and menu.lst to agree with bios on which drive is where
2007-12-10T09:01:00.000Z	earlmred	intelikey	strange that i can boot off the rescue cd though ... maybe i should rip out the highpoint IDE card
2007-12-10T09:01:00.000Z	intelikey	earlmred	i.e. if you reorder drives in bios then you have to adjust grub accordingly
2007-12-10T09:03:00.000Z	intelikey	earlmred	linux uses phisical addressing,  grub uses bios addressing   kinda a throat cutting contest there.    one alternate solution might be to use UUID addressing in grub
2007-12-10T09:03:00.000Z	earlmred	intelikey	my grub shows UUID addresses, this is a fresh install.
2007-12-10T09:03:00.000Z	earlmred	intelikey	i just pulled out the raid IDE card, same problem, cannot mount selected partition.
2007-12-10T09:17:00.000Z	intelikey	earlmred	don't forget   count=1
2007-12-10T09:17:00.000Z	earlmred	intelikey	what's count=1 going to do for me
2007-12-10T09:17:00.000Z	intelikey	earlmred	keep it from writing zero to the whole disk
2007-12-10T10:31:00.000Z	intelikey	earlmred	no dash there
2007-12-10T10:31:00.000Z	intelikey	earlmred	probably still works  but it gripes about it.
2007-12-10T10:32:00.000Z	earlmred	intelikey	it'll work either way.
2007-12-10T10:33:00.000Z	earlmred	intelikey	i removed all of the drives, put the boot drive on sata 1, and grub installed properly.
2007-12-10T10:34:00.000Z	intelikey	earlmred	ummm might be some docs that would help   /msg ubotu ati     maybe
