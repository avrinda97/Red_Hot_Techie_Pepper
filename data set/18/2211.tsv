2010-07-19T18:15:00.000Z	sgflt		hey everyone. is it possible to disable the local cupsd and use a remote one to print?
2010-07-19T18:15:00.000Z	m7stic	sgflt	yes
2010-07-19T18:16:00.000Z	sgflt	m7stic	how would i do that? i stopped the local cupsd, and used the printing administration gui to connect to the other cups server. i can print test pages there fire. however, i cannot find an option to make the remote server be the default/show up in file->print dialogs
2010-07-19T18:23:00.000Z	sgflt	m7stic	any suggestion how?
2010-07-19T18:23:00.000Z	m7stic	sgflt	i'm searching google
2010-07-19T18:24:00.000Z	m7stic	sgflt	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/NetworkPrintingWithUbuntu
2010-07-19T18:25:00.000Z	sgflt	m7stic	that still uses two cups instances, doesn't it?
2010-07-19T18:26:00.000Z	m7stic	sgflt	did you read it?
2010-07-19T18:26:00.000Z	sgflt	m7stic	i'd say so. point me to what i missed then
2010-07-19T18:28:00.000Z	sgflt	m7stic	hmm, i've gotten cups to not use the local but remote server (using /etc/cups/client.conf) - now i just need to find out where gtkprint stores the default server
2010-07-19T18:29:00.000Z	m7stic	sgflt	now you have direction for research. keep going
2010-07-19T18:29:00.000Z	sgflt	m7stic	solved it =)
2010-07-19T18:30:00.000Z	sgflt	m7stic	need to tell gtk-print to use lp as the backend =)
2010-07-19T18:30:00.000Z	sgflt	m7stic	put gtk-print-backends="pdf,cups,lpr" in ~/.gtkrc-2.0
2010-07-19T18:30:00.000Z	sgflt	m7stic	and with the client.conf - voila
2010-07-19T18:30:00.000Z	m7stic	sgflt	good job
2010-07-19T18:31:00.000Z	sgflt	m7stic	thanks for the moral support =)
2010-07-19T18:31:00.000Z	sgflt	m7stic	bye!
