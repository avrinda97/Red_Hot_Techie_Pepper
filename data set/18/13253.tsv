2005-12-18T17:40:00.000Z	munzir		Sirs, where can I find an explanation of what each repository means?
2005-12-18T12:12:00.000Z	munzir		hi sirs, when I enable all the repositories in the synaptic, would the installer try find the package in the CD first and then shift to the net if not available?
2005-12-18T12:12:00.000Z	Kuyaedz	munzir	I believe it checks the CD first if that line is not #'d in the sources.list
2005-12-18T12:14:00.000Z	munzir	Kuyaedz	 anyway I can tell whether the package is on the CD or not in advance?
2005-12-18T12:15:00.000Z	Kuyaedz	munzir	....not sure, never tried.  is there something you're looking for specifically?
2005-12-18T12:17:00.000Z	munzir	Kuyaedz	no I am new and can't yet understand all this universe, multiverse, restricted stuff! Now when I see: Base System, Base System (universe), Base System (restricted) what does this mean?
2005-12-18T12:17:00.000Z	Kuyaedz	munzir	those are the repositories (or databases) where you have programs available to you
2005-12-18T12:19:00.000Z	munzir	Kuyaedz	ok but what's the difference and why I have three base systems?
2005-12-18T12:20:00.000Z	Kuyaedz	munzir	they each hold different files.. just organization
2005-12-18T12:21:00.000Z	Kuyaedz	munzir	there is one for security updates, one for base files, etc..
2005-12-18T12:21:00.000Z	munzir	Kuyaedz	Umm! so now if I want to install things like flash or play DVD what do I need to add?
2005-12-18T12:22:00.000Z	Kuyaedz	munzir	you'll probably want the universe repository & backports
2005-12-18T12:22:00.000Z	munzir	Kuyaedz	backports means what? I thought it has something to do with old packages, no?
2005-12-18T12:23:00.000Z	Kuyaedz	munzir	backports is more not-officially supported packages, but some very useful
2005-12-18T12:24:00.000Z	Kuyaedz	munzir	if you're in synaptic check Settings > Repositories > Add & make sure everything is checked
2005-12-18T12:24:00.000Z	Kuyaedz	munzir	that'll give you access to the widest range of supported programs for installation
2005-12-18T12:28:00.000Z	munzir	Kuyaedz	thanks a lot for this tip of enabling the backports. It worked
2005-12-18T12:28:00.000Z	Kuyaedz	munzir	no problem
