2005-09-01T05:26:00.000Z	frans-th		anyone can explain the wording of ubuntu trademark: we will sponsor registration fees for approved domains, and leave technical administrative control in the hands of the website operator.
2005-09-01T05:27:00.000Z	frans-th		what is that mean?
2005-09-01T05:29:00.000Z	ompaul	frans-th	talk to canonical directly
2005-09-01T05:29:00.000Z	ompaul	frans-th	thats two types of directly :) one where you do the talking and two where you do it now
2005-09-01T05:29:00.000Z	frans-th	ompaul	talk what?
2005-09-01T05:30:00.000Z	ompaul	frans-th	about getting ubuntu registered in your country and all sorts of funky stuff there
2005-09-01T05:31:00.000Z	ompaul	frans-th	enjoy
2005-09-01T05:32:00.000Z	frans-th	ompaul	jeff said that ubuntu is own by canonical
2005-09-01T05:32:00.000Z	frans-th	ompaul	do you know what is the restriction of ubuntu?
2005-09-01T05:33:00.000Z	ompaul	frans-th	talk to canonical - the people who own it - there are very very few restrictions - they are all good ones
2005-09-01T05:33:00.000Z	ompaul	frans-th	read the GPL
2005-09-01T05:35:00.000Z	frans-th	ompaul	i know GPL :) but the logo? is it GPL?
2005-09-01T05:36:00.000Z	ompaul	frans-th	for definitive answers talk to canonical - the logo has copyrights - they will allow you use it if you can comply with certain restrictions - they know what they are - if you want to do something with their stuff you need to talk to them
2005-09-21T06:33:00.000Z	ompaul	frans-th	you can get all the info you need here: http://www.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/TrademarkPolicy/view?searchterm=logo
2005-09-21T06:35:00.000Z	ompaul	frans-th	read the trademark doc - it says what you have to do to use it - and some of what you can't do
2006-01-12T17:44:00.000Z	ompaul	frans-th	dapper
2006-01-12T17:44:00.000Z	frans-th	ompaul	right :P
2006-01-12T17:52:00.000Z	ompaul	frans-th	it is not built for breezy nor will it be, but you then have to manage any issues yourself you loose the security of the distro, as in others managing problems they become yours do this with 10 packages and you now have to watch a lot of stuff
