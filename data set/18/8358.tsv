2009-04-24T04:57:00.000Z	RandomUsr		god I love the 9600 gt in Jaunty with the nvidia driver woohoo
2009-04-24T04:57:00.000Z	RandomUsr		I think I may have to switch to Kubuntu however, cuz I like KDE a bit more
2009-04-24T04:58:00.000Z	bahadunn	RandomUsr	I just ordered a 9500 gt cause I am not happy with what fglrx is doing with my radeon hd 3300

2009-04-24T04:58:00.000Z	bahadunn	RandomUsr	pny

2009-04-24T04:59:00.000Z	bahadunn	RandomUsr	I had an xfx for some years which worked very well
2009-04-24T04:59:00.000Z	RandomUsr		xfx is great
2009-04-24T04:59:00.000Z	bahadunn	RandomUsr	is PNY really so much worse then your favorite BFG?
2009-04-24T04:59:00.000Z	bahadunn	RandomUsr	the PNY card I looked at had good reviews
2009-04-24T05:00:00.000Z	bahadunn	RandomUsr	the BFG was expensive
2009-04-24T05:00:00.000Z	RandomUsr		pny doesn't implement the firmware well, and it can hang a bit in SLI
2009-04-24T05:00:00.000Z	bahadunn	RandomUsr	well if it sucks bad I will go with BFG okay?
2009-04-24T05:01:00.000Z	RandomUsr	bahadunn	stick with your heart man, it just wasn't for me
