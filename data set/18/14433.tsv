2009-06-09T08:34:00.000Z	Rick316		I am trying to install my first Ubuntu server but I cant seem to get the GUI interface to start
2009-06-09T08:34:00.000Z	Rick316		All I get is the terminal prompt.
2009-06-09T08:34:00.000Z	Rick316		I can log in but that is about it.
2009-06-09T08:36:00.000Z	Rick316		has anyone successfully installed Ubuntu 9.4 server?
2009-06-09T08:36:00.000Z	Rick316		yes racecar that is what I am attempting to install
2009-06-09T08:37:00.000Z	Rick316		right now on a VM
2009-06-09T08:37:00.000Z	Rick316		I need to test it to make sure that it will do what we need it to do.
2009-06-09T08:37:00.000Z	Rick316		but the GUI interface wont load.
2009-06-09T08:39:00.000Z	Rick316		hello?
2009-06-09T08:41:00.000Z	Rick316		yes
2009-06-09T08:41:00.000Z	rob_p	Rick316	Server doesn't install the desktop by default.  Did you add that yourself?  Also, what's the point of that in the first place?
2009-06-09T08:42:00.000Z	rob_p	Rick316	nope, at least not by default.
2009-06-09T08:43:00.000Z	rob_p	Rick316	Why load server if you want a desktop?
2009-06-09T08:44:00.000Z	rob_p	Rick316	because it's unnecessary
2009-06-09T08:44:00.000Z	rob_p	Rick316	huge
2009-06-09T08:46:00.000Z	rob_p	Rick316	Why waste cpu cycles and RAM to support a full UI when the purpose of a server is to serve up data?
2009-06-09T08:47:00.000Z	rob_p	Rick316	It sounds to me like you want a desktop with some server capabilities.  In that case, simply install the desktop edition and then bring in the server apps you want to play with.
2009-06-09T08:47:00.000Z	rob_p	Rick316	welcome!  good luck.
