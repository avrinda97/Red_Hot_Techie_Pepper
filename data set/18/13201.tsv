2006-03-26T11:34:00.000Z	Eleaf		how do I disable telnet?
2006-03-26T11:35:00.000Z	tritium	Eleaf	don't install it in the first place
2006-03-26T11:35:00.000Z	Eleaf	tritium	I didn't
2006-03-26T11:35:00.000Z	Eleaf	tritium	does that mean it isn't activated?
2006-03-26T11:35:00.000Z	tritium	Eleaf	then you don't have it
2006-03-26T11:35:00.000Z	Eleaf	tritium	what could this mean?  this happens whenever connecting to my ftp server  227 Entering Passive Mode (192,168,0,2,130,129).
2006-03-26T11:35:00.000Z	Eleaf	tritium	then it times out
2006-03-26T11:35:00.000Z	Eleaf	tritium	that happens whenever I do "ls" or something
2006-03-26T11:36:00.000Z	tritium	Eleaf	no idea
2006-03-26T11:37:00.000Z	tritium	Eleaf	why not use a ssh server instead, anyway?
2006-03-26T11:38:00.000Z	Eleaf	tritium	you can for ftp?
2006-03-26T11:38:00.000Z	tritium	Eleaf	sftp
2006-03-26T11:38:00.000Z	Eleaf	tritium	I need to use ftp for my python program
2006-03-26T11:38:00.000Z	Eleaf	tritium	will it act the same way?  do you think this is a problem to do with my ftp server?
2006-03-26T11:38:00.000Z	tritium	Eleaf	okat then
2006-03-26T11:38:00.000Z	Eleaf	tritium	this is fine when I connect locally
2006-03-26T11:38:00.000Z	tritium	Eleaf	perhaps
2006-03-26T11:38:00.000Z	Eleaf	tritium	when connecting from the internet, it does that timeout passive thing
