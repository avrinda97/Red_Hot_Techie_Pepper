2007-06-29T10:22:00.000Z	john`		how come when I boot into cd and use sudo chmod +x /etc/init.d/rc and then I see the file is execute and then when I reboot it still say that the file is not booting up and I can't boot up the machine?
2007-06-29T10:22:00.000Z	jacktheripper	john`	cds are read only
2007-06-29T10:23:00.000Z	jacktheripper	john`	run it manually, chmod +x it and then do /etc/init.d/blah start
2007-06-29T10:23:00.000Z	jacktheripper	john`	you hae to redo it every time you reboot...cuz the cd is read only :)
2007-06-29T10:24:00.000Z	john`	jacktheripper	what do you mean by run it manually?
2007-06-29T10:24:00.000Z	jacktheripper	john`	just do /blah/blah/blah/thefileyouchmoded and that will execute it
2007-06-29T10:24:00.000Z	jacktheripper	john`	you run it yourself after making it executable vs rebooting
2007-06-29T10:25:00.000Z	jacktheripper	john`	lol no
2007-06-29T10:26:00.000Z	jacktheripper	john`	just boot the cd like normal, then when you get in and after you chmod the file you can manually execute the file to start whatever service you were trying to start
2007-06-29T10:26:00.000Z	john`	jacktheripper	can you give me step by step, I am kind of new, sorry =(
2007-06-29T10:26:00.000Z	jacktheripper	john`	you havent even told us what you are trying to do
2007-06-29T10:27:00.000Z	jacktheripper	john`	ohhh :)
2007-06-29T10:27:00.000Z	jacktheripper	john`	ok so boot the cd, mount your root partition mount /dev/??? /mnt/blah;  and then chmod +x /mnt/blah/etc/init.d/rc
2007-06-29T10:27:00.000Z	jacktheripper	john`	done :)
2007-06-29T10:29:00.000Z	jacktheripper	john`	fdisk -l
2007-06-29T10:43:00.000Z	john`	jacktheripper	yay thanks, it works =) but I have a question, how come I don't see the /mnt folder in ubuntu cd even after I show all hidden files, is it just there?
2007-06-29T10:43:00.000Z	jacktheripper	john`	i have no idea...they must be protecting people from discovering /mnt
2007-06-29T10:44:00.000Z	jacktheripper	john`	i only use the console for my file management...so no
