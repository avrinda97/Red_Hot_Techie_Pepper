2007-01-14T12:35:00.000Z	Dave-Ubuntu	koregaonpark	not as much as a noob as me - first 36 hours (straight lol) so far installed two hard drives - shared it on the network and now this - so thank you!
2007-01-14T12:36:00.000Z	koregaonpark	Dave-Ubuntu	wow you're a fast learner. It took me a few days to get my home folder shared on the network. SMB works like a charm.

2007-01-14T12:39:00.000Z	Dave-Ubuntu	koregaonpark	dont install the "dodgy" dvd decoders from it - it fouled my system up playing DVDS - but apart from that all the other options worked fine
2007-01-14T12:40:00.000Z	koregaonpark	Dave-Ubuntu	why didn't you install the recommended DVD decoders? Hang on, I'll get you a link.
