2009-09-30T16:00:00.000Z	cheater99		hey guys
2009-09-30T16:00:00.000Z	cheater99		what's the keyboard shortcut for switching between tabs?
2009-09-30T16:00:00.000Z	cheater99		like say in gedit when i have two files open and want to switch between them
2009-09-30T16:00:00.000Z	cheater99		really? that's terrible
2009-09-30T16:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	cheater99	might e alt+shift+tab
2009-09-30T16:01:00.000Z	cheater99	ActionParsnip1	that just brings up the alt-tab menu but it cycles it the other way around
2009-09-30T16:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	cheater99	there is no agreed standard for that shortcut so apps are free to use what they wish
2009-09-30T16:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	cheater99	quick websearch yields: http://live.gnome.org/Gedit/KeyboardShortcuts
2009-09-30T16:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	cheater99	ctrl+alt + pg Up/Down
2009-09-30T16:02:00.000Z	cheater99	ActionParsnip1	^^ thanks
2009-09-30T16:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	cheater99	websearching solves all
2009-09-30T16:02:00.000Z	cheater99	ActionParsnip1	 right ^^
2009-09-30T16:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	cheater99	try it is all I can say, firefox has a key for it too and even a 3D tab switcher like the window switcher in Vista
2009-09-30T16:04:00.000Z	cheater99	ActionParsnip1	never used vista :)
2009-09-30T16:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	cheater99	it moves them round like a 3D pack of cards
2009-09-30T16:04:00.000Z	cheater99	ActionParsnip1	i've seen that once on linux :) cool thing
