2007-12-13T11:46:00.000Z	noname6243		I don't know, I am thinking about buying a mac powerbook notebook
2007-12-13T11:46:00.000Z	noname6243		i believe that has intel core duo
2007-12-13T11:47:00.000Z	noname6243		so would it just be reagular x86?
2007-12-13T11:48:00.000Z	noname6243		Well, I also want it for movie and sound editing
2007-12-13T11:48:00.000Z	macogw	noname6243	mac hardware uses EFI which means installing GRUB to be able to boot Ubuntu is slightly more annoying than on commodity hardware.  if you're abandoning OSX completely anyway, it's not worth bothering with.  if you want OSX still though, then yeah go for it
2007-12-13T11:49:00.000Z	noname6243	macogw	 do you dual boot ?
2007-12-13T11:49:00.000Z	macogw	noname6243	no
2007-12-13T11:50:00.000Z	noname6243	macogw	you mean harder because you need to use bootcamp ?
2007-12-13T11:50:00.000Z	macogw	noname6243	i recall being told by a mac user that you have to use LILO instead of GRUB, but i think there are GRUB extensions to do EFI.  in that case, i think you need to use the Super GRUB Disk, but as i dont own/need/want a mac, i've never had to do it myself
2007-12-13T11:51:00.000Z	macogw	noname6243	i think you use bootcamp for dualboot and lilo alone for single-linux-boot
2007-12-13T11:51:00.000Z	macogw	noname6243	i know there are howtos out there and have been for a while.  in april, kernighan (helped invent C and UNIX) said he'd just installed ubuntu on his macbook as his first time ever trying linux
2007-12-13T11:52:00.000Z	macogw	noname6243	he used unix before then
2007-12-13T11:53:00.000Z	macogw	noname6243	probably bsd unix
2007-12-13T11:53:00.000Z	macogw	noname6243	nite nite
