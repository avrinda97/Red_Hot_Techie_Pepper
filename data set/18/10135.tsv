2007-01-08T10:07:00.000Z	josh0403		Hi I messed up my xorg.conf and I was wondering if there was a way to modify it while in live cd mode
2007-01-08T10:08:00.000Z	josh0403		Or would I have to completely reinstall ubuntu?
2007-01-08T10:08:00.000Z	sdgr406	josh0403	instead of using a livecd you could boot into single user mode and modify the file from the console
2007-01-08T10:09:00.000Z	josh0403	sdgr406	I tried but it crashes.
2007-01-08T10:09:00.000Z	sdgr406	josh0403	crashes how?
2007-01-08T10:11:00.000Z	josh0403	sdgr406	well, I boot up and before I can login, it gives me an error that says something along the lines of failed to start xserver(your graphical interface. then it freezes up .
2007-01-08T10:11:00.000Z	sdgr406	josh0403	how are you booting to single user mode? it sounds like it's still trying to boot into X
2007-01-08T10:11:00.000Z	josh0403		and when I try to boot into recovery mode, my kebord wont work
2007-01-08T10:12:00.000Z	josh0403	sdgr406	well actually I don't know what single user mode is. lol
2007-01-08T10:12:00.000Z	sdgr406	josh0403	hehe, ok
2007-01-08T10:13:00.000Z	josh0403	sdgr406	but when I fo into recovery mode, my keyboard doesn't work
2007-01-08T10:13:00.000Z	sdgr406	josh0403	when you boot the machine and you get the GRUB splash (the screen with the different kernels listed), highlight the kernel you want to boot and hit 'e' then go to the kernel line and hit 'e' again... add 'init=/bin/sh' to the end of the line and hit 'b' to boot that entry
2007-01-08T10:14:00.000Z	sdgr406	josh0403	it'll start to boot and then give you just a #
2007-01-08T10:14:00.000Z	josh0403		then I can edit xorg sdgr406 ?
2007-01-08T10:14:00.000Z	sdgr406	josh0403	yeah, should be able to
2007-01-08T10:14:00.000Z	josh0403		sweet thanks
2007-01-08T10:15:00.000Z	sdgr406	josh0403	if that doesn't work or you seem to have trouble, just reboot and it'll boot like normal
2007-01-08T10:15:00.000Z	josh0403	sdgr406	sure thing
