2004-12-05T15:42:00.000Z	socomm	james	it probably wants a newer version of ssl
2004-12-05T15:43:00.000Z	socomm	james	does configure detect ssl?
2004-12-05T15:45:00.000Z	socomm	james	I think configure requires a special flag to enable ssl
2004-12-05T15:45:00.000Z	socomm	james	./configure --help | grep -i ssl
2004-12-05T15:45:00.000Z	socomm	james	something like --enable-ssl or something
2004-12-05T15:46:00.000Z	socomm	james	check the output of that command I gave you awhile ago.
2004-12-05T15:47:00.000Z	socomm	james	cool
2004-12-21T06:24:00.000Z	socomm	james	How? Pray. Or compile it yourself.
