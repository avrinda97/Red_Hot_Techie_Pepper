2007-07-22T15:42:00.000Z	arso		hey guys, i am having trouble removing beryl
2007-07-22T15:44:00.000Z	arso		Can anyone help me remove beryl completely from my system.
2007-07-22T15:44:00.000Z	heskethj	arso	Open up synaptic and do a search for "beryl" and then "compiz" removing all the packages that are start with either term
2007-07-22T15:45:00.000Z	arso	heskethj	Enselic_ oh i did sudo apt-get remove beryl-manager
2007-07-22T15:45:00.000Z	arso	heskethj	 i want to keep compiz
2007-07-22T15:45:00.000Z	heskethj	arso	just remove beryl then. beryl-manager is the applet that sits in your panel and allows you control your window manager
2007-07-22T15:46:00.000Z	arso	heskethj	 i see, great ty, and do u recommend compiz fusion to a newbie/?
2007-07-22T15:47:00.000Z	heskethj	arso	compiz fusion is defiantly a great improvement but it is still beta (maybe even alpha) software which means it is sometimes prone to breaking (although hasn't been too bad for me). If you find a good tutorial (a search for ubuntu compiz fusion will do) you should be fine, but be warned, it isn't all white clouds and dreams. Compiz fusion is a merge of compiz and beryl but is probably more similar to beryl. So if you don
2007-07-22T15:51:00.000Z	arso	heskethj	i removed everything with beryl from synaptic, but the effects are still working, do i need to restart x for it to work.
2007-07-22T15:51:00.000Z	heskethj	arso	most likely. Or you can just type "metacity --replace" into a terminal. Also double check that beryl isn't in yoru session start up list. System->preferences->session
2007-07-22T15:53:00.000Z	arso	heskethj	ty
2007-07-22T15:54:00.000Z	heskethj	arso	no worries. I assume it worked fine?
2007-07-22T15:54:00.000Z	arso	heskethj	 yes.
2007-07-22T15:54:00.000Z	arso	heskethj	i only have 2 workspaces now
2007-07-22T15:54:00.000Z	heskethj	arso	just right click on your workspace applet and set it to 4 (or your desired amount)
2007-07-22T15:55:00.000Z	arso	heskethj	i went to system>pref>desktop effects> and selected the cube workspaces
2007-07-22T15:55:00.000Z	arso	heskethj	 how does it work, wts the hotkey
2007-07-22T15:57:00.000Z	heskethj	arso	The desktop effects will only work if you have it turned on... if you wish to use your system without compiz (which is what I assumed you were aiming at doing) you just right click on the little side changer down the bottom right of your panel and select preferences. In both compiz, beryl and metacity (the non-effects default window manage for Ubuntu/Gnome) Ctrl+alt+left/right change desktop spaces
