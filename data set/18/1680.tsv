2012-04-11T09:55:00.000Z	sacarlson	TheEmpath	even with you old ubuntu no longer being supported I assume it still works?
2012-04-11T09:55:00.000Z	TheEmpath	sacarlson	ubuntu still works... the ssh key is not letting me use the passphrase
2012-04-11T09:56:00.000Z	sacarlson	TheEmpath	what about the old install that shouldn't have changed
2012-04-11T09:56:00.000Z	TheEmpath	sacarlson	old install?  i didn't upgrade ubuntu.  it just told me its no longer supported
2012-04-11T09:57:00.000Z	sacarlson	TheEmpath	so it's not supported what did you do erase it?
2012-04-11T09:57:00.000Z	TheEmpath	sacarlson	what?  Maverick apparently is no longer being supported, thats all the message way

2012-04-11T10:02:00.000Z	TheEmpath	sacarlson	Can't be hackers.  The key is on a VM on my local box.
2012-04-11T10:02:00.000Z	sacarlson	TheEmpath	well on the remote side they can regen a new set of keys
2012-04-11T10:03:00.000Z	sacarlson	TheEmpath	oh ok so you try to gen a new key set and it makes bad ones, wow I'm not sure
2012-04-11T10:04:00.000Z	TheEmpath	sacarlson	no
2012-04-11T10:05:00.000Z	sacarlson	TheEmpath	I've never played with it but I think there is an option for a time window for a key to expire
2012-04-11T10:09:00.000Z	sacarlson	TheEmpath	seems they are forced to expire I must put very long time windows on mine http://www.rsa.com/rsalabs/node.asp?id=2272
