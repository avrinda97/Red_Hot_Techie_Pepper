And how can I just type in the user name and password for just on the terminal and just go into a desktop session or something. Is there away to do that or am I crazy:)
2012-06-01T19:54:00.000Z	reisio	tbrown	server doesn't come with the desktop stuff, IIRC
2012-06-01T19:54:00.000Z	reisio	tbrown	you'd have to install it
2012-06-01T19:55:00.000Z	tbrown	reisio	Yes I understand that I have to install the desktop envirment first I just wonder after the desktop is installed how can I get into the desktop session???
2012-06-01T19:55:00.000Z	reisio	tbrown	you could: start lightdm, or run startx
2012-06-01T19:56:00.000Z	reisio	tbrown	(or configure ~/.xinitrc and run startx, that is)
2012-06-01T19:57:00.000Z	tbrown	reisio	I was wondering about that about startx because that works on backtrack two. But I installed the desktop experence or something and I tryed to run startx it work but it did not show the desktop or it did but it show the desktop and the mouse and when I type something it went to the bottom right corner screen:)
2012-06-01T19:58:00.000Z	reisio	tbrown	you _are_ meant to configure ~/.xinitrc first
2012-06-01T19:59:00.000Z	tbrown	reisio	How can I configur it first sorry am new two this stuff:)
