2009-04-25T15:06:00.000Z	minimec	nik_	there is 'fdisk' for the console and 'gparted' with a GUI. CHoose fat32 if you want to stay compatible with win/mac ...
2009-04-25T15:07:00.000Z	minimec	nik_	'man fdisk' 'fdisk --help' in a console
2009-04-25T15:09:00.000Z	minimec	nik_	use gparted and delete the existing partitions of the flash drive. The USB Creater will then format the flash drive again.
2009-04-25T15:10:00.000Z	nik_	minimec	there is only 1 partition in my flash disk, but tis formatted with ntfs, thats why it cannot detect it perhaps?/
2009-04-25T15:11:00.000Z	minimec	nik_	Unmaount that partition and delete it. Then start the USB creator again.
2009-04-25T15:13:00.000Z	nik_	minimec	i unmounted the usb flash disk, now what do i ahve to do?
2009-04-25T15:14:00.000Z	minimec	nik_	You have to unmount the 'ntfs' partition in 'gparted'. Then you can delete that partition. Having done that, you can start the USB creator again. It will tell you that the drive is ot formatted... and will format it for you ;)
2009-04-25T15:24:00.000Z	minimec	nik_	Give it another try and verify that you do evrything right. This is the way, you get your Ubuntu installed on that flash drive.
2009-04-25T15:24:00.000Z	nik_	minimec	why gaprted every time i open it it still say thet /dev/sdc1 is mounted and it is ntfs?
2009-04-25T15:25:00.000Z	minimec	nik_	As I told you: You have to unmount that ntfs partition inside 'gparted' (right click) on the partition in gparted... 'unmount' , then 'delete'
2009-04-25T15:27:00.000Z	minimec	nik_	Good point :) So commit changes... ;)
2009-04-25T15:34:00.000Z	nik_	minimec	?
2009-04-25T15:35:00.000Z	minimec	nik_	yes?
2009-04-25T15:38:00.000Z	nik_	minimec	any ideas?
2009-04-25T15:38:00.000Z	minimec	nik_	strange. I tried that usb creator just one time and it worked for me. Try to format that drive again. I have no other ideas.
2009-04-25T15:39:00.000Z	nik_	minimec	when i format the partition with gaprted do i ahve to create aprtuitions in it in ordet for usb creator to work?
2009-04-25T15:41:00.000Z	minimec	nik_	just delete all partitions on the drive. the USB creator will partiton and format the device.
