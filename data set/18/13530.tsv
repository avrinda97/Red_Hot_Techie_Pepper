2005-12-06T08:09:00.000Z	rohan	frogzoo	neither. i tried.
2005-12-06T08:09:00.000Z	rohan	frogzoo	it does not have gparted
2005-12-06T08:09:00.000Z	frogzoo	rohan	rip has it I think (checks)
2005-12-06T08:11:00.000Z	frogzoo	rohan	don't trust dd with your data - it's a bad plan - use tar or cpio
2005-12-06T08:13:00.000Z	frogzoo	rohan	you were asking earlier - RIP has parted - not sure if this is the same as gparted
2007-01-16T07:43:00.000Z	frogzoo	rohan	option "users"
2007-01-16T07:43:00.000Z	rohan	frogzoo	just add one more option, users ?
2007-01-16T07:44:00.000Z	frogzoo	rohan	s/user/users
2007-01-16T07:46:00.000Z	rohan	frogzoo	did not work
2007-01-16T07:51:00.000Z	rohan	frogzoo	did not help
2007-01-16T07:59:00.000Z	frogzoo	rohan	for fat, it's 4 digits "umask=0000"
