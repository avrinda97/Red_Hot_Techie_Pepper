2009-01-28T22:02:00.000Z	Terabyte		hey i'm using kcron on a linutop, and for some reason dispite the fact that 'RUN NOW' button works, the tasks themselves don't seem to run.
2009-01-28T22:03:00.000Z	ikonia	Terabyte	what version of ubuntu
2009-01-28T22:03:00.000Z	Terabyte	ikonia	how can i tell?
2009-01-28T22:03:00.000Z	ikonia	Terabyte	show me the output of uname -a
2009-01-28T22:04:00.000Z	ikonia	Terabyte	that doesn't look like an ubuntu kernel
2009-01-28T22:05:00.000Z	Terabyte	ikonia	what does it look like to you?
2009-01-28T22:05:00.000Z	ikonia	Terabyte	not an ubuntu kernel
2009-01-28T22:08:00.000Z	Terabyte	ikonia	do you know how to find out exactly what one it is? I am almost certain it is ubuntu 8.04
2009-01-28T22:08:00.000Z	ikonia	Terabyte	it's not ubuntu 8.04
2009-01-28T22:08:00.000Z	ikonia	Terabyte	try pastebining the output of lsb_release -a
2009-01-28T22:09:00.000Z	Terabyte	ikonia	it says ubuntu 8.04 release 8.04 hardy :P
2009-01-28T22:09:00.000Z	ikonia	Terabyte	ok - so someone has customised it as thats not an ubuntu kernel
2009-01-28T22:09:00.000Z	Terabyte	ikonia	yes it is a linnutop, it is very customised, my question still stands regarding kcron though
2009-01-28T22:09:00.000Z	ikonia	Terabyte	then I suggest you contact them for support
2009-01-28T22:10:00.000Z	Terabyte	ikonia	 but it's running ubuntu.... why can't i get support here?
2009-01-28T22:10:00.000Z	ikonia	Terabyte	because you've just said it's customised
2009-01-28T22:10:00.000Z	ikonia	Terabyte	we don't know what else has changed
2009-01-28T22:10:00.000Z	ikonia	Terabyte	the people who put that install together will
