2004-10-30T14:08:00.000Z	Ng		you can kinda do it with twinview metamodes if you don't mind screwing with your resolution ;)
2004-10-30T14:10:00.000Z	Ng		much nicer than having to restart X to play ut though :)
2004-10-30T14:10:00.000Z	Ng		I did try having a 1600x1200,NULL metamode as well as 1600x1200,1600x1200, but that just made the xinerama bits go extremely wonky ;(
2004-10-30T14:11:00.000Z	punkass	Ng	so you just have it set up so depending on the res one or two monitors are on?
2004-10-30T14:11:00.000Z	Ng	punkass	yep
2004-10-30T14:28:00.000Z	punkass	Ng	well it didnt like that much :(
2004-10-30T14:30:00.000Z	punkass	Ng	Parse error on line 107 of section Screen in file /etc/X11/XF86Config-4
2004-10-30T14:30:00.000Z	Ng	punkass	the only obvious difference is I didn't have spaces in mine
2004-10-30T14:30:00.000Z	Ng	punkass	except after the ;
2004-10-30T14:31:00.000Z	Ng	punkass	paste me the line you put into the config :)
2004-10-30T14:31:00.000Z	punkass	Ng	i just tried:   Option "MetaModes" "1280x1024 , 1024x768" "1024x768 , NULL"
2004-10-30T14:32:00.000Z	Ng	punkass	it should be: Option    "MedaModes"  "1280x1024,1024x768; 1024x768,NULL"
2004-10-30T14:33:00.000Z	Ng	punkass	np, hope it works :)
2004-10-30T14:49:00.000Z	punkass	Ng	well that seems to work pretty nicly
2004-10-30T14:51:00.000Z	Ng	punkass	erk, that sounds like a bug :/
2004-10-30T14:52:00.000Z	Ng	punkass	newp, exiting the game just pops me back to 1600x1200,1600x1200 desktop
