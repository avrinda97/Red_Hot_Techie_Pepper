2005-04-09T09:31:00.000Z	membreya	alterim	perhaps if you just ask your question

2005-04-09T09:33:00.000Z	alterim	membreya	elaborate
2005-04-09T09:33:00.000Z	membreya	alterim	/var/cache/apt/archives/
2005-04-09T09:34:00.000Z	membreya	alterim	check your /var/cache/apt/archives
2005-04-09T09:35:00.000Z	membreya	alterim	to truly test it do a sudo apt-get clean
2005-04-09T09:35:00.000Z	membreya	alterim	it clears out your /var/cache/apt/archives/ directory
2005-04-09T09:36:00.000Z	alterim	membreya	you're the first person to have helped me. are you on aim/msn?
2005-04-09T09:37:00.000Z	membreya	alterim	if you really want it's membreya@hotmail.com :)
2005-04-21T09:53:00.000Z	membreya	alterim	install the codecs dude
2005-04-21T09:54:00.000Z	alterim	membreya	you make it sound easy!!
2005-04-23T16:19:00.000Z	membreya	alterim	learn your lesson..dump the gf
2005-04-23T16:24:00.000Z	membreya	alterim	that's no great accomplishment
2005-04-23T16:33:00.000Z	membreya	alterim	you know, if you were truly security concious, you wouldn't have your ip advertised..you do know that MS, Adobe and the like have software piracy reporting channels? :P
