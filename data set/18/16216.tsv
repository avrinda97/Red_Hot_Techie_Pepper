2004-11-01T15:22:00.000Z	nickers		does the default kernel have no loop iso mount support?
2004-11-01T15:22:00.000Z	nickers		i thought so too
2004-11-01T15:23:00.000Z	nickers		mount -o loop blah.iso /mnt/tmp
2004-11-01T15:23:00.000Z	nickers		cant find /dev/loop
2004-11-01T15:24:00.000Z	stvn	nickers	nickers sudo modprobe loop
2004-11-01T15:25:00.000Z	nickers	stvn	thats a no go :)
2004-11-01T15:26:00.000Z	stvn	nickers	ls /dev/loop* does result in loop0-loop7?
2004-11-01T15:27:00.000Z	stvn	nickers	sudo mount -t iso9660 -o loop=/dev/loop0 <file>.iso /cdrom shoudld work
2004-11-01T15:28:00.000Z	stvn	nickers	you could also change permissions of the /dev/loops
2004-11-01T15:29:00.000Z	nickers	stvn	specify the loop device worked
2004-11-01T15:30:00.000Z	stvn	nickers	prolly a debian thing, i always defined the loop device anyway
2004-11-01T15:30:00.000Z	nickers	stvn	guess i will have to get used to the debian way :) thanks for the help
2004-11-01T15:30:00.000Z	stvn	nickers	np
2004-11-01T15:40:00.000Z	stvn	nickers	I only care if it's a computer on my lan ;)
2004-11-01T15:40:00.000Z	nickers	stvn	i do network security :) i totally understand that position
2004-11-01T15:41:00.000Z	stvn	nickers	I do care about illegal software though, because like i said it supports the big players
2004-11-01T15:41:00.000Z	nickers	stvn	i agree. When i was in the military microsoft looked the other way to giving us illegal software for home use because they knew we were the base admins...if we use it at home...we want it at work....
2004-11-01T15:41:00.000Z	stvn	nickers	I'm the 'computer-guy' in the house and I told everyone I will not support windows, but will install/support linux, so they all switched to linux ;)
