2009-12-07T22:58:00.000Z	DasEi	Axz	if it says new kernel installed, got to reboot
2009-12-07T22:58:00.000Z	Axz	DasEi	what do you think could be issue?
2009-12-07T23:00:00.000Z	DasEi	Axz	either aq failing drive or you somehow lost the right driver for it, alo could try another app, maybe an update conflicts with a 'static' nero install, re-install nero or try k3b
