2009-04-28T23:17:00.000Z	xiaolindraconis		hello guys
2009-04-28T23:18:00.000Z	xiaolindraconis		what all would i need to edit to change my install directory?
2009-04-28T23:19:00.000Z	xiaolindraconis		can someone help me?
2009-04-28T23:19:00.000Z	xiaolindraconis		id like to change my install directory
2009-04-28T23:19:00.000Z	xiaolindraconis		i want to move ubuntu from / to /ubuntu
2009-04-28T23:20:00.000Z	mbeierl	xiaolindraconis	that's not quite the way "installations" work in linux
2009-04-28T23:21:00.000Z	mbeierl	xiaolindraconis	files are installed under /bin /usr /lib /tmp /dev /var , etc
2009-04-28T23:22:00.000Z	mbeierl	xiaolindraconis	so that would mean you want them installed under /ubuntu/bin /ubuntu/usr, etc?
2009-04-28T23:22:00.000Z	mbeierl	xiaolindraconis	not sure I know of any way to do that, but, why, just out of curiosity?
2009-04-28T23:23:00.000Z	mbeierl	xiaolindraconis	the reason I ask why is that there might be a better way to accomplish what you are trying to do
2009-04-28T23:24:00.000Z	mbeierl	xiaolindraconis	another linux os?
2009-04-28T23:25:00.000Z	mbeierl	xiaolindraconis	I would recommend splitting the partition into two, and booting each one by partition.  if there's shared data you want, make a 3rd partition for common files and mount it in both (such as /home)
2009-04-28T23:27:00.000Z	mbeierl	xiaolindraconis	it's probably safer that way too as you won't "accidentally" modify the wrong installation if your booted into the 'other'
2009-04-28T23:28:00.000Z	mbeierl	xiaolindraconis	there is a concept called "chroot" which confines the current process to a subdirectory of a filesystem.  anyone here worked with chrooted boots?
2009-04-28T23:28:00.000Z	mbeierl	xiaolindraconis	split the first partition into 2?
2009-04-28T23:31:00.000Z	mbeierl	xiaolindraconis	in that case, I'd google chroot and linux booting
2009-04-28T23:32:00.000Z	mbeierl	xiaolindraconis	something like this might help: http://alioth.debian.org/docman/view.php/30192/21/debian-amd64-howto.html#id292010
2009-04-28T23:33:00.000Z	mbeierl	xiaolindraconis	but you can ignore the 64bit part, just read over the concepts
