2008-04-28T00:25:00.000Z	Otacon22	amenado	i don't know, but i know that is possibile to have an input/output audio
2008-04-28T00:27:00.000Z	Otacon22	amenado	i want to use my soundcard with headphones and microphones, to talk on phone line by modem. So that i could make phone calls by modem. I KNOW that is possibile because there are some software like vgetty that make you able to create an "auto-response system" that broadcast a message if someone call and register what you say
2008-04-28T00:31:00.000Z	Otacon22	amenado	http://alpha.greenie.net/vgetty/ , it don't interest to me, i want to make calls
