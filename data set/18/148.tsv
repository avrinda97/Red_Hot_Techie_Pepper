2012-07-27T00:06:00.000Z	hkais		IPsec, I tried it myself a while ago
2012-07-27T00:08:00.000Z	hkais		I couldn't get the cisco running under ubuntu... :(
2012-07-27T00:09:00.000Z	hkais		hmm okay what cisco vpn hardware do you use?
2012-07-27T00:09:00.000Z	bthatcher	hkais	ASA 5510
2012-07-27T00:11:00.000Z	bthatcher	hkais	at first I thought it was a missing package. now Im leaning more towards a service that isnt started till doing an apt-get?
2012-07-27T00:12:00.000Z	hkais	bthatcher	what does your log says?
2012-07-27T00:14:00.000Z	bthatcher	hkais	I've only checked dmesg and nothing jumps out at me. Any other logs I should check
2012-07-27T00:14:00.000Z	bthatcher		?
2012-07-27T00:14:00.000Z	hkais		yes the startup of the networkmanager
2012-07-27T00:16:00.000Z	bthatcher	hkais	should that be in the dmesg log file or another?
2012-07-27T00:20:00.000Z	hkais	bthatcher	take a look in syslog
2012-07-27T00:20:00.000Z	hkais		there should be a entry with *nm*
2012-07-27T00:22:00.000Z	hkais		any hints why cron does not execute my file /etc/cron.d/otrs?
2012-07-27T00:22:00.000Z	bthatcher	hkais	thanks, will d.
2012-07-27T00:22:00.000Z	bthatcher		do
2012-07-27T00:23:00.000Z	bthatcher		Ill check on the otrs
2012-07-27T00:23:00.000Z	hkais	bthatcher	could you give me a example config for getting the vpn running with cisco? I couldn't get it running
