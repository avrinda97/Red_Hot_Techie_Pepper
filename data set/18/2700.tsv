2010-03-14T07:48:00.000Z	amit1_		so far so good
2010-03-14T07:48:00.000Z	amit1_		hey is anyone family with developing on Mono?
2010-03-14T07:50:00.000Z	amit1_		any software developers on here?
2010-03-14T07:50:00.000Z	amit1_		or programmers...
2010-03-14T07:51:00.000Z	amit1_		what is the best way to deploy a kernel module
2010-03-14T07:51:00.000Z	amit1_		on ubuntu...
2010-03-14T07:52:00.000Z	amit1_		I have created a Kernel module for a PCI device...do I just have to copy it to /lib/modules?
2010-03-14T07:52:00.000Z	amit1_		and run depmod?
2010-03-14T07:53:00.000Z	amit1_		I know I can just add an "insmod" command to the local startup script, but I thought there should be a better way to automatically load the module at startup when the proper pci device is detected..
2010-03-14T07:55:00.000Z	amit1_		oh okay, I'll try the forums :)
2010-03-14T07:56:00.000Z	brjann	amit1_	if you just want to force a module load at boot, add the module name to /etc/modules
2010-03-14T07:56:00.000Z	amit1_	brjann	is this how other kernel modules would work?
2010-03-14T07:57:00.000Z	amit1_	brjann	I mean if you were to download a kernel module for a device, would you just add it to /etc/modules?
2010-03-14T07:57:00.000Z	brjann	amit1_	/etc/modules is useful for modules that for whatever reason aren't loaded by the kernel even though they should be.
2010-03-14T07:58:00.000Z	brjann	amit1_	generally speaking modules are autoloaded when the hardware is detected, without needing to add them to /etc/modules. but sometimes that just doesn't work right
2010-03-14T08:00:00.000Z	amit1_		Is Ubuntu 10.04 optimized for power consumption on notebooks?
2010-03-14T08:00:00.000Z	amit1_		Or is there a way to turn this feature "on"
2010-03-14T08:01:00.000Z	brjann	amit1_	all lucid support questions should be directed to #ubuntu+1
