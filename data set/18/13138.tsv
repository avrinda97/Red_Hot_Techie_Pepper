2010-07-13T19:06:00.000Z	romeo_	IdleOne	to complicated for me.
2010-07-13T19:07:00.000Z	IdleOne	romeo_	what is to complicated?
2010-07-13T19:07:00.000Z	IdleOne	romeo_	tell us what is going on with apt-get that you feel is a bug
2010-07-13T19:07:00.000Z	romeo_	IdleOne	I am looking for an url, where I can file a bug for apt-get. Is it an ubuntu problem or is it an upstream problem?
2010-07-13T19:08:00.000Z	IdleOne	romeo_	www.launchpad.net is the url
2010-07-13T19:08:00.000Z	IdleOne	romeo_	but please tell us what is happening so we can maybe help
2010-07-13T19:09:00.000Z	romeo_	IdleOne	apt-get excepts other strings than "Y" as confirmation. E.g. "Yn". It shouldn't do that.
2010-07-13T19:10:00.000Z	IdleOne	romeo_	I suspect it is only Reading the first character for the confirmation.
2010-07-13T19:10:00.000Z	IdleOne	romeo_	if you do Ny does it have the expected behavior?
2010-07-13T19:11:00.000Z	romeo_	IdleOne	Of course not. It installs the unwanted software
2010-07-13T19:12:00.000Z	IdleOne	romeo_	then it is a bug.
2010-07-13T19:12:00.000Z	IdleOne	romeo_	in terminal type: ubuntu-bug apt
2010-07-13T19:13:00.000Z	IdleOne	romeo_	that will prepare the bug report and then you can add details to it after it opens the browser
2010-07-13T19:14:00.000Z	IdleOne	romeo_	:)
2010-07-13T20:24:00.000Z	romeo_	IdleOne	Reading your question again. My answer is the opposite: apt-get with Ny *will* cancel the install as expected. Playing around with apt-get for a while now, it seems accepting Y* is a feature and not a bug. Thanks for helping!
2010-07-13T20:24:00.000Z	IdleOne	romeo_	welcome
