2009-05-23T16:39:00.000Z	Zhane		i'm using wubi with ubuntu intrepid. but when i try to install it, it hang at system paritioning, formating some swap partition. I tried redl the iso, defrag my drive, defrag swap.disk, chk for errors with my drive, but it doesnt help. what can i do?
2009-05-23T16:41:00.000Z	P4R41	Zhane	hangs how? takes a long time to do nothing? gives an error?
2009-05-23T16:41:00.000Z	Zhane	P4R41	takes a long time to do nothing
2009-05-23T16:41:00.000Z	P4R41	Zhane	how large is the drive?
2009-05-23T16:42:00.000Z	Zhane	P4R41	i tried to make 8gb ones, the swap was ard 1gb..and im using ntfs for that drive
2009-05-23T16:42:00.000Z	P4R41		you're using ntfs for the swap?
2009-05-23T16:42:00.000Z	Zhane	P4R41	 the drive where the swap is held is ntfs
2009-05-23T16:43:00.000Z	P4R41		how is the drive partitioned?
2009-05-23T16:43:00.000Z	Zhane	P4R41	dunno? wubi did it for me
2009-05-23T16:43:00.000Z	P4R41		then it didn't really partition it. is it a dual system?
2009-05-23T16:43:00.000Z	P4R41		dual boot system*
2009-05-23T16:43:00.000Z	Zhane	P4R41	ya..
2009-05-23T16:44:00.000Z	P4R41		you have windows on one parition, correct?
2009-05-23T16:44:00.000Z	Zhane	P4R41	my main is windows, and i run wubi on it to install ubuntu
2009-05-23T16:46:00.000Z	P4R41	Zhane	i'd suggest booting from the live cd and installing onto the partition windows isn't on
2009-05-23T16:46:00.000Z	Zhane	P4R41	hmm.. windows on C, wubi on D
2009-05-23T16:46:00.000Z	Zhane		i can still use wubi when booting from live cd?
2009-05-23T16:46:00.000Z	P4R41	Zhane	from what i learned, wubi doesn't really install ubuntu, it just throws it on top of the windows install
