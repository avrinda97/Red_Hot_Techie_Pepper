2006-08-20T09:13:00.000Z	dr_willis	BeepAU	 and what part are ya having the issue with?
2006-08-20T09:13:00.000Z	BeepAU	dr_willis	-- i've never complied anything before. i don't understand it.
2006-08-20T09:14:00.000Z	dr_willis	BeepAU	 you will need to apt-get install the source for your kernel.. i forget the command for that. :) and install the build-essential package as well
2006-08-20T09:15:00.000Z	BeepAU	dr_willis	-- i've got the archive i downloaded from the site, isn't that enough? the stuff in apt-get can be quite old i hear.
2006-08-20T09:15:00.000Z	dr_willis	BeepAU	 or ya could convert the bin/cue to an iso. then mount the thing like you would any other iso.
2006-08-20T09:15:00.000Z	dr_willis	BeepAU	 you need the source for the kernel you ARE RUNNING now. :)
2006-08-20T09:15:00.000Z	dr_willis	BeepAU	 more up to date source. may not work right.
2006-08-20T09:16:00.000Z	BeepAU	dr_willis	-- i don't get you. i need the source for ubuntu?
2006-08-20T09:16:00.000Z	BeepAU	dr_willis	-- can you explain to me what that is?
2006-08-20T09:17:00.000Z	dr_willis	BeepAU	 some 'modules'  to be compiled must have the kernel source for them to access/use as well. the verion of the source code. must match your currently running kernel, that you are making the module for.
2006-08-20T09:17:00.000Z	BeepAU	dr_willis	-- ok, well how do i get the source for my kernel?
2006-08-20T09:19:00.000Z	dr_willis	BeepAU	 its a lot easier to just convert the .cue/bin to iso. unless ya got a hunderd of the things.
2006-08-20T09:20:00.000Z	dr_willis	BeepAU	 bchunk binfile.bin cuefile.cue myisofile.iso    - after you install bchunk.
2006-08-20T09:21:00.000Z	BeepAU	dr_willis	-- meh. i'd like to install the program. it's more convenient.
2006-08-20T09:21:00.000Z	dr_willis	BeepAU	 ya got some work to do then. install the kernel source, and build-essential, then follow the guide.  someone in here will rember the right way tog et the source. or check the wiki/forums
2006-08-20T09:22:00.000Z	BeepAU	dr_willis	-- ok then. well, it's late. i'll try it tomorrow.
