2011-10-30T11:31:00.000Z	hey_joe		i keep trying to use 'ssh -R 9999:localhost:22 user@remotehost' to tunnel an ssh connection for my locked up work machine.  this works, but I must first ssh to remotehost, then establish a connection to localhost on port 9999 to connect to my locked up work machine.
2011-10-30T11:31:00.000Z	hey_joe		is there a way to make this bind to a specific up or interface on the remotehost side? so i can skip logging into the remote host, and ssh directly to remotehost:9999 ?  i have tried the typical remotehost:9999:localhost:22... howver it fails to bind on remotehost's wan ip.
2011-10-30T11:31:00.000Z	hey_joe		any tips?
2011-10-30T11:31:00.000Z	hey_joe		remotehost has a dedicated ip, and i can bind to ports.
2011-10-30T11:33:00.000Z	yagoo	hey_joe	i don't think you're supposed to be doing that..
2011-10-30T11:34:00.000Z	hey_joe		yagoo..
2011-10-30T11:34:00.000Z	hey_joe		its legit.
2011-10-30T11:34:00.000Z	yagoo	hey_joe	dunno.. you should check with your company policy?
2011-10-30T11:34:00.000Z	yagoo	hey_joe	btw u would use another option
2011-10-30T11:34:00.000Z	hey_joe		what option?
2011-10-30T11:34:00.000Z	yagoo		,/persay-- an additional option
2011-10-30T11:35:00.000Z	hey_joe		ive tried fooling with sshd_config
2011-10-30T11:35:00.000Z	hey_joe		to avail.
2011-10-30T11:35:00.000Z	hey_joe		hrm
2011-10-30T11:36:00.000Z	hey_joe	dr_willis	i need a static mysql connection.
2011-10-30T11:37:00.000Z	yagoo	hey_joe	there's actually a number of ways you can automate this-- probably 1 you'd be familar with is -c
2011-10-30T11:37:00.000Z	hey_joe		and for some reason althou it works on the remotehost, mysql client automatically assumes localhost is on the default mysql port.
2011-10-30T11:37:00.000Z	yagoo	hey_joe	if you're using putty, u can setup what command to run right away after login
