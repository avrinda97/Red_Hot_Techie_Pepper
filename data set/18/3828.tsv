2009-08-16T09:43:00.000Z	arleslie	apoleo12	hey
2009-08-16T09:45:00.000Z	apoleo12	arleslie	before i do some grub repair.. there's soemthing I wanna clarify something here. the grub according to the menu.lst is pointing at h2,4 but according to windows disk managment; linux is on the third drive on a first partition
2009-08-16T09:45:00.000Z	arleslie	apoleo12	then where it says hd (0,1) it should be hd (3,1)
2009-08-16T09:46:00.000Z	arleslie	apoleo12	I remember it
2009-08-16T09:47:00.000Z	apoleo12	arleslie	im gomnna go in to liveCD to do ggrub editing after i finish reading the links I got from you
2009-08-16T09:47:00.000Z	arleslie	apoleo12	^^ theres the links you need
2009-08-16T09:49:00.000Z	apoleo12	arleslie	tho it's strange that windows disk management tells me differently... which it should be hd2,0 but not hd2,4
2009-08-16T09:49:00.000Z	arleslie	apoleo12	x86/AMD64 is the link you wanted
2009-08-16T09:49:00.000Z	arleslie	apoleo12	what does Windows Disk Management say
