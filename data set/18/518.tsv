2012-01-14T21:39:00.000Z	ubuntu	Guest97033	ok, you need to speak understandable english before anyone will help you.
2012-01-14T21:40:00.000Z	Guest97033	ubuntu	well my soundcard dont work, my graphic card dont work. its just a mess
2012-01-14T21:41:00.000Z	ubuntu	Guest97033	close enough to english...those are driver issues.  What verson of ubuntu are you trying to use, and what's the hardware?
2012-01-14T21:42:00.000Z	ubuntu	Guest97033	just use the generic drivers until you can find a driver which will work.  ati likely put out some proprietary stuff which may have issues.
2012-01-14T21:43:00.000Z	ubuntu	Guest97033	do you get to the desktop on that machine?
2012-01-14T21:43:00.000Z	ubuntu	Guest97033	details!
2012-01-14T21:44:00.000Z	ubuntu	Guest97033	if you just say its broke, that doesn't help anyone fix it.
