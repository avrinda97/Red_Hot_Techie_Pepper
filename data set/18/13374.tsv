2005-11-29T11:13:00.000Z	Tedd		Hi.
2005-11-29T11:13:00.000Z	Tedd		Noob question
2005-11-29T11:13:00.000Z	Tedd		How do I open .bins
2005-11-29T11:14:00.000Z	nalioth	Tedd	depends on the bin (what type it is)
2005-11-29T11:40:00.000Z	nalioth	Tedd	edit your sources.list adn remove the us. or ca. from the front of archive.blah
2006-01-05T11:22:00.000Z	nalioth	Tedd	ask your question to the channel
2006-01-05T11:27:00.000Z	Tedd	nalioth	I know about root. I said it wrong, sorry
2006-01-05T11:30:00.000Z	nalioth	Tedd	if you could tell us the error, i guarantee we could fix it
2006-01-05T11:36:00.000Z	Tedd	nalioth	I got the error
2006-01-05T11:37:00.000Z	Tedd	nalioth	It told me that "My session lasted less than ten seconds, and that I wanted to try and use one of the failsafe sessions". I tried them, and they didn't work- it resulted in the same error
2006-01-05T11:38:00.000Z	nalioth	Tedd	did it give you a reason why it didnt last?
2006-01-05T11:39:00.000Z	Tedd	nalioth	possibly because of an installation problem
2006-01-05T11:40:00.000Z	Tedd	nalioth	any ideas?
2006-01-05T11:41:00.000Z	nalioth	Tedd	i have no idea. log in on a rescue terminal and run "rm ~/.ICEauthority"
2006-01-05T11:41:00.000Z	Tedd	nalioth	I'm on a failsafe terminal. I'll try that right now, but I have to leave XChat.
2006-04-27T11:10:00.000Z	nalioth	Tedd	photoshop on linux?
2006-04-27T11:10:00.000Z	Tedd	nalioth	yes. I'm installing with WINE and I reeeaaaally don't want to have to go hunting for Crossover Office
2006-04-27T11:10:00.000Z	nalioth	Tedd	you might get better luck in #winehq
