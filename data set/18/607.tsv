2011-12-02T20:39:00.000Z	meadhikari	Guest67345	the oupput of fdisk -l dev/sdb is also nothing
2011-12-02T20:39:00.000Z	Guest67345	meadhikari	If it does not have any partitions, create one:  sudo fdisk /dev/sdb and then p  to see what is really there and then  n  for new partition.  (m for help).
2011-12-02T20:39:00.000Z	Guest67345	meadhikari	 sudo fdisk -l /dev/sdb
2011-12-02T20:39:00.000Z	Guest67345	meadhikari	sudo
2011-12-02T20:40:00.000Z	Guest67345	meadhikari	 sudo fdisk -l /dev/sdb  | pastebinit    #Send us the URL and we'll have a look.
2011-12-02T20:41:00.000Z	meadhikari	Guest67345	i really get no output
2011-12-02T20:41:00.000Z	Guest67345	meadhikari	Then do as szal suggests.
2011-12-02T20:43:00.000Z	Guest67345	meadhikari	Is it even being recognized by the system as it is plugged in?  (To find out do this:  open a terminal, type tail: -f /var/log/messages Plug it in and see what comes across the screen in that terminal.
2011-12-02T20:43:00.000Z	meadhikari	Guest67345	ThinkT510 yes it is listed
2011-12-02T20:44:00.000Z	Guest67345	meadhikari	 sudo fdisk -l /dev/sdb  | pastebinit    #Send us the URL and we'll have a look.
