2009-09-24T05:34:00.000Z	Trizicus		Yes :)
2009-09-24T05:35:00.000Z	losher	Trizicus	you might've mentioned that earlier...
2009-09-24T05:21:00.000Z	losher	Trizicus	I never found dmesg worked with tail -f, though you'd want it to. I had to resort to running dmesg repeatedly...
2009-09-24T05:25:00.000Z	losher	Trizicus	what kind of hardware? Is it removable?
2009-09-24T05:26:00.000Z	losher	Trizicus	dmesg | egrep -i cdrom  <-- something like this?
2009-09-24T05:29:00.000Z	losher	Trizicus	usually for a cdrom, /dev/cdrom will be an alias for the cdrom device so you can use either that or it's 'real' name...
2009-09-24T05:30:00.000Z	Trizicus	losher	okay I got it now. cdrom on here is link to hdc :)
2009-09-24T05:31:00.000Z	Trizicus	losher	When I put in my flash drive the /var/log/messages was saying it was not supported any reason why?
2009-09-24T05:34:00.000Z	losher	Trizicus	are you running vmware?
2009-09-24T05:36:00.000Z	losher	Trizicus	dunno if this is relevant: http://communities.vmware.com/thread/209645
2009-09-24T05:36:00.000Z	Trizicus	losher	what I'm trying to be able to do is learn how to detect devices as I insert them into the system. (which is what I was trying to do with the USB thing) How could I do that? Just dmesg | egrep -i "usb"?
2009-09-24T05:37:00.000Z	losher	Trizicus	well that's how I do it, but the proper way to do is via udev I think, which I find very complicated....

2009-10-02T23:59:00.000Z	Trizicus	losher	the -F option on shutdown is it still present (I dont see it in manpages)
2009-10-03T00:01:00.000Z	losher	Trizicus	It's not in my man pages either (hardy, 8.04) so you can't rely on it anyway...
