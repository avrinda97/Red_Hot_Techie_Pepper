2006-08-04T10:07:00.000Z	dserban		Anyone familiar with populating your /dev directory to have your kernel successfully boot?  All i've got in there currently is /dev/.static.  If I boot with the livecd, how do I get MAKEDEV to create everying in /dev/ (just for a successful boot so that udev can take over)?
2006-08-04T10:08:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	dserban	just build the kernel with make-kpkg
2006-08-04T10:14:00.000Z	dserban	h3sp4wn	nothing will build unless I start binding mounts which I see as unecessary.
2006-08-04T10:15:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	dserban	What is the problem with that ?
2006-08-04T10:15:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	dserban	just bind /dev /sys /proc
2006-08-04T10:15:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	dserban	build the kernel with make-kpkg
2006-08-04T10:16:00.000Z	dserban	h3sp4wn	I just don't see the point as I'm just missing my /dev tree
2006-08-04T10:16:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	dserban	If you want to build your own kernel (against the ubuntu toolchain) anything other than make-kpkg will cause you problems
2006-08-04T10:17:00.000Z	dserban	h3sp4wn	I don't want to build the kernel ;)
2006-08-04T10:20:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	dserban	I don't understand what you are attempting to do
2006-08-04T10:21:00.000Z	dserban	h3sp4wn	I'm trying to boot my machiene.
2006-08-04T10:21:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	dserban	with which kernel ?
2006-08-04T10:22:00.000Z	dserban	h3sp4wn	it has a kernel, it just panics that devfs is missing, which I've found out to be missing /dev/console
2006-08-04T10:22:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	dserban	built yourself or linux-image-2.6.15 ?
2006-08-04T10:23:00.000Z	dserban	h3sp4wn	linux-image-2.6.17-1-amd64-k8-smp
2006-08-04T10:24:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	dserban	On edgy ?
2006-08-04T10:24:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	dserban	If so please join #ubuntu+1
2006-08-04T10:24:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	dserban	If not you need a newer udev / sysutils backported from edgy and to rebuild it against dapper
