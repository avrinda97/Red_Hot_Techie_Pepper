2008-09-30T03:19:00.000Z	unop	roukoun	you could create a symlink to the executable - but you don't have control over the icon then - it could look a bit ugly.
2008-10-01T21:22:00.000Z	unop	roukoun	you'll need to change the PS1 environmental variable - it's defined in ~/.bashrc
2008-10-01T21:23:00.000Z	roukoun	unop	the following content refers to the xterm not to aterm i think... '# If this is an xterm set the title to user@host:dir'
2008-10-01T21:24:00.000Z	unop	roukoun	that's the title not the prompt - search for PS1
2008-10-01T21:26:00.000Z	roukoun	unop	the only point that PS1 appears is here: '# set a fancy prompt (non-color, unless we know we "want" color)'
2008-10-01T21:26:00.000Z	unop	roukoun	try this.  PS1=":\$ "
2008-10-01T21:27:00.000Z	unop	roukoun	if that sets your prompt to how you want it - you could place the line in ~/.bashrc
2008-10-01T21:29:00.000Z	roukoun	unop	i didnt really understand what you mean... here http://paste.ubuntu.com/52896/ is my ~/.bashrc . can you tell me what i have to change from here?
2008-10-01T21:30:00.000Z	unop	roukoun	what did you want your prompt to be?
2008-10-01T21:30:00.000Z	roukoun	unop	':~$'
2008-10-01T21:31:00.000Z	unop	roukoun	type this out in your terminal now.   PS1=":\w\$ "
2008-10-01T21:31:00.000Z	unop	roukoun	tell me if that's what you expect?
2008-10-01T21:32:00.000Z	roukoun	unop	that's it!!!! and it will remain like this every time i log in or i have to execute the command to take effect?
2008-10-01T21:33:00.000Z	unop	roukoun	no, you'll need to put that line at the very end of your ~/.bashrc  .. line #75
2008-10-01T21:33:00.000Z	unop	roukoun	only then will it stick
2008-10-01T21:33:00.000Z	roukoun	unop	thanks a lot!!!
