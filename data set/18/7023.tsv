2008-02-17T02:20:00.000Z	clocKwize	amenado	Ubuntu 7.10 - Supported to 2009
2008-02-17T02:21:00.000Z	clocKwize	amenado	i don't think so, it doesn't say livecd
2008-02-17T02:21:00.000Z	clocKwize	amenado	ubuntu-7.10-desktop-amd64.iso
2008-02-17T02:22:00.000Z	clocKwize	amenado	it loads up, comes up saying to install, then goes to terminal, says busy box xxxx blah blah blah, then the prompt is (initfs)
2008-02-17T02:24:00.000Z	clocKwize	amenado	i don't want to waste another dvd if its not going to work - i'm on number 3 now..
2008-02-17T02:24:00.000Z	clocKwize	amenado	should it work if its on a dvd when its a cd iso?
2008-02-17T02:25:00.000Z	clocKwize	amenado	ok, i'll try it, its burning at 16x
2008-02-17T02:25:00.000Z	clocKwize	amenado	the iso is a CD, but i'm burning it to a DVD disk - nero converts it and it boots correctly into it, so i guess it should work, but maybe the installer assumes its on a cd?
2008-02-17T02:26:00.000Z	clocKwize	amenado	there is no dvd iso for ubantu is there? i can't find one
2008-02-17T02:27:00.000Z	clocKwize	amenado	i don't have any cdrom's
2008-02-17T02:28:00.000Z	clocKwize	amenado	oh ok, i won't do it then, if thats the case
2008-02-17T02:29:00.000Z	clocKwize	amenado	i don't have one though! :)
