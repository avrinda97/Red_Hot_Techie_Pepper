2007-12-25T12:14:00.000Z	haymaker		pelo ok.  should i use the user mount option?
2007-12-25T12:15:00.000Z	haymaker		pelo i have a similar setup, but i have 4 hard disks already
2007-12-25T12:16:00.000Z	nickrud	haymaker	with that many, it's probably wise for you to read up on lvm (logical volume management)
2007-12-25T12:17:00.000Z	nickrud	haymaker	use the uuid's to identify the partitions , ls /dev/disks/by-uuid
2007-12-25T12:17:00.000Z	nickrud	haymaker	or the labels, that way you don't have to worry about device name shifts
2007-12-25T12:19:00.000Z	nickrud	haymaker	yeah, the libata shift is a pain, but I see the rationale. It is still 'pesky' (good word :)
2007-12-25T12:22:00.000Z	nickrud	haymaker	I'm not that conversant with grub, I knew lilo well but with ubuntu & grub I've only scratched the surface
2007-12-25T12:22:00.000Z	haymaker	nickrud	i had lilo all the other times i tried linux, it was ok but grub seems better to me
2007-12-25T12:23:00.000Z	nickrud	haymaker	yes, it's much more versatile. Also much more complex because of it
2008-01-09T09:33:00.000Z	nickrud	haymaker	in the session dialog, select gnome-panel . Then down below, make it normal instead of restart.  alt-f2 pkill gnome-panel, it should die and not restart. Save the session
2008-01-09T09:38:00.000Z	nickrud	haymaker	last tab on that session dialog
2008-01-09T09:38:00.000Z	haymaker	nickrud	just click the button?  if i have xchat and all sorts of programs open will it launch them automatically?
2008-01-17T09:28:00.000Z	nickrud	haymaker	if you have compiz running, install compizconfig-settings-manager, it'll show up in system->prefs->advanced desktop
2008-01-17T09:31:00.000Z	haymaker	nickrud	I have that package installed, but I dont see it
2008-01-17T09:33:00.000Z	nickrud	haymaker	hm. Try  alt-f2  killall gnome-panel  your panels will restart, and it should rebuild your menus as well
2008-01-17T09:39:00.000Z	haymaker	nickrud	can I just run a command to get it to open?  I dont have gnome panels
2008-01-17T09:40:00.000Z	nickrud	haymaker	yes, ccsm .
2008-01-17T09:50:00.000Z	haymaker	nickrud	thanks for your help man
