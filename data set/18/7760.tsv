2007-12-17T23:39:00.000Z	kleftisx		Tim0thy : when i was upgrading i was aksed about removing some packages and i forgot and press skip maybe this is a problem?
2007-12-17T23:42:00.000Z	T1m0thy	kleftisx	Are the packages "gnome-panel" and "gnome-panel-data" installed?
2007-12-17T23:44:00.000Z	kleftisx		Tim0thy: i dont know. is there any way to find?
2007-12-17T23:45:00.000Z	T1m0thy	kleftisx	System > Administration > Synaptic Package Manager, then click "Search" at the top and type in "gnome-panel", then press enter. "gnome-panel" and "gnome-panel-data" should have grayed/blacked out boxes around them.
2007-12-17T23:46:00.000Z	T1m0thy		fleftisx: Oh sorry, I forgot you don't have a panel. Let me find the command.
