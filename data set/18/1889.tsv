2011-07-05T03:58:00.000Z	KM0201	babu	updating it online, would take HOURS.. because it is so old.. to get it current, you would be better of downloading a new version and clean installing
2011-07-05T03:58:00.000Z	KM0201	babu	truth be told, i'm guessing you'd run into epic errors trying to go from 5.04, to a current release.
2011-07-05T04:01:00.000Z	KM0201	babu	updating that version of Linux, will literally take forever, if it even is successful, because so many of those servers are no longer maintained
2011-07-05T04:21:00.000Z	KM0201	babu	the chances of you installing anything on a release that old, is slim to none... you need to upgrade
2011-07-05T04:21:00.000Z	KM0201	babu	if its not already on there (installed out of the box) you're not gonna be able to install it.. you need to bring that machien to a current release.
2011-07-05T04:22:00.000Z	KM0201	babu	you need to upgrade, i can't be anymore clear
2011-07-05T04:22:00.000Z	KM0201	babu	just because it has a path, doesn't mean it will work
