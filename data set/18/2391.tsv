2010-05-28T06:23:00.000Z	unexpectedapocal		How do I re-add the network manager to my top bar?
2010-05-28T06:24:00.000Z	unexpectedapocal		Can someone help me please?
2010-05-28T06:26:00.000Z	unexpectedapocal		Hi, can someone please tell me how to restore the network manager indicator applet to the top bar?
2010-05-28T06:26:00.000Z	velociostrich	unexpectedapocal	just right click on it and click add to panel
2010-05-28T06:26:00.000Z	velociostrich	unexpectedapocal	oh nvm
2010-05-28T06:27:00.000Z	velociostrich	unexpectedapocal	you'll have to manually re-start the network manager applet
2010-05-28T06:27:00.000Z	velociostrich	unexpectedapocal	try running nm-applet
2010-05-28T06:27:00.000Z	unexpectedapocal	velociostrich	didn't work either
2010-05-28T06:28:00.000Z	velociostrich	unexpectedapocal	is it possible that you don't have the notification thingie on your panel?
2010-05-28T06:30:00.000Z	unexpectedapocal	velociostrich	it isn't on my panel.
2010-05-28T06:30:00.000Z	velociostrich	unexpectedapocal	if you try to add the notification area back, you might have to try running nm-applet again
2010-05-28T06:30:00.000Z	velociostrich	unexpectedapocal	you could also try running like stalonetray or something and then running nm-applet to see if it pops up there
2010-05-28T06:31:00.000Z	velociostrich	unexpectedapocal	but you'd have to install that first
2010-05-28T06:31:00.000Z	velociostrich	unexpectedapocal	you're welcome :)
2010-05-28T06:31:00.000Z	velociostrich	unexpectedapocal	no problem
