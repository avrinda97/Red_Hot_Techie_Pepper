2006-07-15T09:41:00.000Z	tom1502		does anyone knows which software ubuntu uses to realise Hibernation, and in which file i can set logfile and increase verbosity?
2006-07-15T09:42:00.000Z	bbrazil	tom1502	it's in the kernel.
2006-07-15T09:42:00.000Z	tom1502	bbrazil	so no swsusp or suspen2?
2006-07-15T09:42:00.000Z	bbrazil	tom1502	I'm not up in this area
2006-07-15T09:43:00.000Z	tom1502	bbrazil	do u know anyone i could ask?
2006-07-15T09:43:00.000Z	bbrazil	tom1502	acpi is probably what you should poke into, especially in /proc
2006-07-15T09:43:00.000Z	tom1502	bbrazil	well i've found the file /etc/default/acpi-support, but i dunno the syntax to control log and verbosity...
2006-07-15T09:44:00.000Z	tom1502	bbrazil	coz hibernation works... sometimes
2006-07-15T09:44:00.000Z	tom1502	bbrazil	and i want to find out what causes errors
2006-07-15T09:44:00.000Z	bbrazil	tom1502	I imagine errros will be in dmesg
2006-07-15T09:44:00.000Z	tom1502	bbrazil	not really
2006-07-15T09:44:00.000Z	tom1502	bbrazil	well nothing i can really use
2006-07-15T09:45:00.000Z	bbrazil	tom1502	ton of stuff in /etc/acpi
2006-07-15T09:59:00.000Z	bbrazil	tom1502	yes
2006-07-15T09:59:00.000Z	tom1502	bbrazil	that sucks
2006-07-15T09:59:00.000Z	bbrazil	tom1502	if you have physical access, you can do anything anyway
2006-07-15T09:59:00.000Z	bbrazil	tom1502	no
2006-07-15T10:00:00.000Z	bbrazil	tom1502	if someone has their hands on your laptop, it's already too late
