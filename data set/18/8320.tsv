2007-09-05T16:40:00.000Z	yjwong	amio	what help do you want with?
2007-09-05T16:42:00.000Z	yjwong	amio	first of all, what graphics card do you have?
2007-09-05T16:44:00.000Z	yjwong	amio	if you can do it the Terminal way, use lspci
2007-09-05T16:46:00.000Z	yjwong	amio	go to Accessories -> Terminal, type lspci, then hit Enter/Return
2007-09-05T16:51:00.000Z	amio	yjwong	I tried on terminal to write Ispci
2007-09-05T16:51:00.000Z	yjwong	amio	it is "l" (as in, l for Linux)
2007-09-05T16:53:00.000Z	amio	yjwong	it is ATI Technologies Inc RV350 as i think I saw
2007-09-05T16:54:00.000Z	yjwong	amio	then you need the ATI drivers installed
2007-09-05T16:55:00.000Z	yjwong	amio	I think Ubuntu asks you to install the open source drivers
2007-09-05T16:58:00.000Z	yjwong	amio	i gotta eat now, but meanwhile you can take a look at this thread: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=3294300
