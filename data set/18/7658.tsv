2007-12-04T03:04:00.000Z	slize		hey, i am new to ati and compiz, but do you guys think its possible to run on a x1400 radeon card without advanced tweeking of my system?
2007-12-04T03:06:00.000Z	slize		is there some kind of working tutorial to get compiz to work? i've tried it with nvidia and it was working out of the box, but my notebook has ati and it seems not working!! :(
2007-12-04T03:07:00.000Z	tomd123	slize	generally you just have to install xgl and it work
2007-12-04T03:07:00.000Z	tomd123	slize	don't forget to use the restricted managers for the ati card
2007-12-04T03:07:00.000Z	slize	tomd123	i run gutsy and i thought its shipped with xgl
2007-12-04T03:07:00.000Z	slize	tomd123	whats the name of the manager?
2007-12-04T03:08:00.000Z	tomd123	slize	it  actually runs a fast benchmark, if your laptop is not "capable" then it doesn't install xgl by default
2007-12-04T03:08:00.000Z	tomd123	slize	this is what happened to me, but i just installed xgl and it works fine for me
2007-12-04T03:09:00.000Z	slize	tomd123	how to find out if its installed, cause compiz is marked as installed in synaptics
2007-12-04T03:09:00.000Z	tomd123	slize	see if xgl is installed, search in the spm for xgl
2007-12-04T03:10:00.000Z	slize	tomd123	k, seems like its the xserver-xgl package which is missing
2007-12-04T03:10:00.000Z	tomd123	slize	install it
2007-12-04T03:10:00.000Z	slize	tomd123	thanks, i will try to get it work then :)
2007-12-04T03:11:00.000Z	tomd123	slize	oh ya, for you to be able to customize it through system-prefrences-appearence you have to also install some package called compiz manager or something like that
2007-12-04T03:11:00.000Z	slize	tomd123	but its not needed to update any fglrx drivers? can i run the ones from apt?
2007-12-04T03:11:00.000Z	slize	tomd123	i already have the manager :)
2007-12-04T03:12:00.000Z	tomd123	slize	then you have everything but xgl, just install, restart and your done
2007-12-04T03:12:00.000Z	slize	tomd123	k then, thanks alot. i have to restart! :)
