2010-03-30T01:36:00.000Z	blackxored	erUSUL	I want drivers, it's detected as a sound device, if i'm right, also scanModem doesn't seem to have proper output

2010-03-30T01:41:00.000Z	blackxored	erUSUL	you can take a look at the ModemData.txt generated by scanModem?
2010-03-30T01:42:00.000Z	erUSUL	blackxored	dunno how would that help; i've never setted up a win-modem. i only pointed you to the aviable docs is what i can do
