2005-09-21T05:50:00.000Z	reiki	ripgut	you have a fresh ubuntu install? I just inserted a floppy and it automounted
2005-09-21T05:51:00.000Z	reiki	ripgut	well if you haven't broken automounting it should respond
2005-09-21T05:55:00.000Z	reiki	ripgut	put your floppy in the drive and just type     mount    ... let's see what mount knows about that drive
2005-09-21T05:59:00.000Z	reiki	ripgut	please... #1... calm down. People here really want to help you be successful. Your impatience makes this more difficult
