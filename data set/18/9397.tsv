2007-04-28T05:54:00.000Z	HorizonXP		hey
2007-04-28T05:54:00.000Z	HorizonXP		i can't seem to share files between my two Feisty computers
2007-04-28T05:54:00.000Z	HorizonXP		it's saying that it can't seem find any folders...
2007-04-28T05:55:00.000Z	HorizonXP		it says "Access Denied" when I try to transfer files
2007-04-28T05:56:00.000Z	aoirthoir	HorizonXP	believe it or not I use scp for sharing files and in nautilus when I do connect to server, I choose SSH as the service type.
2007-04-28T05:57:00.000Z	aoirthoir	HorizonXP	what type of method are you trying to use to share files?
2007-04-28T05:57:00.000Z	HorizonXP	aoirthoir	samba
2007-04-28T05:57:00.000Z	aoirthoir	HorizonXP	do you need to share the files with other computers? or just the fiesty ones?
2007-04-28T05:58:00.000Z	HorizonXP	aoirthoir	right now just Feisty
2007-04-28T05:58:00.000Z	aoirthoir	HorizonXP	if you are just trying to share between the fiesty computers all you need to do is install SSH
2007-04-28T05:59:00.000Z	aoirthoir	HorizonXP	it migth be installed already..then click places, connect to server and in the SERVICE TYPE box..choose SSH:)
2007-04-28T05:59:00.000Z	aoirthoir	HorizonXP	it works smooth as silk
2007-04-28T05:59:00.000Z	aoirthoir	HorizonXP	do you have ssh-server installed?
2007-04-28T05:59:00.000Z	HorizonXP	aoirthoir	no i don't, i'm installing it now... i like ssh better anyway, i was just hoping to get samba working. that's cool tho, thanks!
2007-04-28T06:01:00.000Z	aoirthoir	HorizonXP	no prob g. I like ssh myself. If I *have* to use samba I will..butmostly I try to avoid it. with ssh you can also use sshfs (though I cant help with that) and then you can mount the remote file system... I just found out about sshfs a couple days ago..so when I learn more I can tell you:)
2007-04-28T06:01:00.000Z	HorizonXP	aoirthoir	aiight cool man thanks. i'll look into sshfs too
2007-04-28T06:02:00.000Z	aoirthoir	HorizonXP	once I get pubuntu.com actually up I will start to post screen shot how toos..and hopefully others will also.
2007-04-28T06:02:00.000Z	HorizonXP	aoirthoir	sweet
