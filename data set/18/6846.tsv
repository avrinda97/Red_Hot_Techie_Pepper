2008-12-29T07:22:00.000Z	[[thufir]]		how do I troubleshoot:  Firefox can't find the server at www.google.com.   from the live cd?
2008-12-29T07:22:00.000Z	Slart	[[thufir]]	check the networking settings.. sounds like a dns problem
2008-12-29T07:23:00.000Z	Slart	[[thufir]]	or a general networking problem..
2008-12-29T07:26:00.000Z	Slart	[[thufir]]	try pinging 64.233.183.147 , it's a google.com machine
2008-12-29T07:27:00.000Z	[[thufir]]	Slart	thanks
2008-12-29T07:27:00.000Z	[[thufir]]	Slart	yep, can ping 64.233.183.147 perfectly, so it's a dns problem?
2008-12-29T07:29:00.000Z	Slart	[[thufir]]	yup.. I'm guessing dns then.. what does "cat /etc/resolv.conf" tell you?
2008-12-29T07:29:00.000Z	[[thufir]]	Slart	domain vs.shawcable.net and some other info
2008-12-29T07:30:00.000Z	Slart	[[thufir]]	no lines that start with "nameserver xxx.xxx.xxx.xx" ?
2008-12-29T07:31:00.000Z	Slart	[[thufir]]	can you ping those?
2008-12-29T07:33:00.000Z	Slart	[[thufir]]	ok.. let's try this.. "gksudo gedit /etc/resolv.conf" and change that first nameserver line to use 208.67.222.222 instead of whatever is there now
2008-12-29T07:33:00.000Z	Slart	[[thufir]]	that's one of the opendns servers..
2008-12-29T07:34:00.000Z	Slart	[[thufir]]	then save the file and close the editor
2008-12-29T07:34:00.000Z	[[thufir]]	Slart	ok
2008-12-29T07:36:00.000Z	[[thufir]]	Slart	thanks
2008-12-29T07:36:00.000Z	Slart	[[thufir]]	it works now?
2008-12-29T07:37:00.000Z	Slart	[[thufir]]	now, this isn't a lasting solution.. it might break the next time you update your ip from the dhcp server.. or it might break the next time you restart.. so write down that ip number so you can do this again
2008-12-29T07:38:00.000Z	[[thufir]]	Slart	yes, works for now.  thanks very much.
