2011-12-19T23:27:00.000Z	GTRsdk2	Peyam	Does your computer support HDMI?
2011-12-19T23:27:00.000Z	Peyam		yes
2011-12-19T23:27:00.000Z	Peyam	GTRsdk2	 yes it does
2011-12-19T23:27:00.000Z	GTRsdk2	Peyam	Which version of Ubuntu?
2011-12-19T23:27:00.000Z	Peyam		11.10
2011-12-19T23:29:00.000Z	GTRsdk2	Peyam	And the TV is set to HDMI?
2011-12-19T23:29:00.000Z	Peyam		yes
2011-12-19T23:30:00.000Z	Peyam	GTRsdk2	INTEl (R) Graphics family
2011-12-19T23:35:00.000Z	Peyam	GTRsdk2	 do you know the solution
2011-12-19T23:36:00.000Z	GTRsdk2	Peyam	No. I think if you try searching, you might find the answer. I did a quick google search and found some UBuntu forums posts about it. That might help. I don't have a computer with Intel graphics and HDMI support, so I can't really help with that.
2011-12-19T23:36:00.000Z	Peyam	GTRsdk2	 yes. please send me the link
2011-12-19T23:39:00.000Z	GTRsdk2	Peyam	I don;t know exactly what you have, but you might want to try http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1700656
