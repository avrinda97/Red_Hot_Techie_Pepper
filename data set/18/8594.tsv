2008-04-13T14:33:00.000Z	pk_vex	bazhang	in your opinion, if my wireless card can detect access points, then there is a really good chance that it'd be able to connect to it aiy?
2008-04-13T14:35:00.000Z	pk_vex		k, i'll give it another shot
2008-04-13T14:35:00.000Z	shadowmancer	pk_vex	i disagree, i am having the same issue with gutsy and i am using an intel wireless
