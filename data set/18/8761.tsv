2008-09-06T18:31:00.000Z	adante		can someone explain why i do not have the option of installing nvidia drivers in hardware drivers manager?
2008-09-06T18:31:00.000Z	dr_willis	adante	 ive notice that on some nvidia cards. the tool doseent recoginze them as being nvidia cards.
2011-09-30T10:55:00.000Z	dr_willis	adante	 what filesystem is on it?
2011-09-30T10:55:00.000Z	adante	dr_willis	i can't tell
2011-09-30T10:56:00.000Z	adante	dr_willis	from dmesg log it suggests it attaches as /dev/sde but i can't fdisk this
2011-09-30T10:56:00.000Z	dr_willis	adante	 sudo fdisk -l /dev/sde fails?
2011-09-30T10:57:00.000Z	adante	dr_willis	it just says nothing
2011-09-30T10:57:00.000Z	adante	dr_willis	fdisk /dev/sde says "Unable to open /dev/sde" ( as per pastebin)
2011-09-30T10:58:00.000Z	dr_willis	adante	 you want data from it? or just tring to get it wirking?
2011-09-30T10:58:00.000Z	adante	dr_willis	get data - well i want to check what it is before i wipe, just incase i need it
2011-09-30T10:59:00.000Z	dr_willis	adante	 check out ddrescue guides.
2011-09-30T18:29:00.000Z	dr_willis	adante	  try the text option perhaps.. or theres doxzens of live cds out there that can do it. like 'tiny core linux'
2011-09-30T18:30:00.000Z	adante	dr_willis	is that text mode installation or something else?
2011-09-30T18:30:00.000Z	dr_willis	adante	 theres live cd's that can do console only.
2011-09-30T18:30:00.000Z	dr_willis	adante	 depends on yoru needs.  'text' mode in ubuntu live cd might work.
2011-09-30T18:31:00.000Z	adante	dr_willis	how do i enable that? i know there's a text mode installer on the alt cd, i'm unfamilar with text mode - is this just a grub setting you pass in?
2011-09-30T18:31:00.000Z	adante	dr_willis	thanks!
2011-09-30T18:32:00.000Z	adante	dr_willis	righto cheers
