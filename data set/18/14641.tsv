2005-07-01T13:46:00.000Z	george__	jeanre	here in the US ...if you buy a DVD you only get to watch it once...and then scratch  it and throw it in the garbage and waste all your money for nothing

2005-07-01T13:47:00.000Z	george__	jeanre	and if you want to watch it again...you have to pay more money
2005-07-01T13:47:00.000Z	george__	jeanre	well you have never seen the arcade video games where if you want to play a game again you have to put in more money
2005-07-01T13:48:00.000Z	george__	jeanre	you better start getting used to Trusted/Treacherous Network Computing
2005-07-01T13:48:00.000Z	george__	jeanre	and get ready to empty your wallet and everything you own for the megacorporation's profits
