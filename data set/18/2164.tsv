2010-08-02T09:17:00.000Z	syivana		and none of these packages are in 10.04 repos
2010-08-02T09:17:00.000Z	syivana		because everything is renamed from 9.10
2010-08-02T09:18:00.000Z	syivana		! flash | jinxzs
2010-08-02T09:18:00.000Z	Wiesshund	syivana	you can add the 9.10 repositories, but that could cause problems
2010-08-02T09:19:00.000Z	syivana	Wiesshund	No, I wont mix repos
2010-08-02T09:19:00.000Z	Wiesshund	syivana	run win32 limewire? its an option for now
2010-08-02T09:20:00.000Z	syivana	Wiesshund	I will build limewire from source before that happens
2010-08-02T10:46:00.000Z	Wiesshund	syivana	the login screen?
2010-08-02T10:46:00.000Z	syivana	Wiesshund	I found gdmsetup, will see if it does what I need it to
2010-08-02T10:47:00.000Z	Wiesshund	syivana	which screen are you calling gdm?
2010-08-02T10:48:00.000Z	syivana	Wiesshund	The only screen, where gdm shows anything (yes the login screen, what other screen for gdm is there that you can change a bg image?)
2010-08-02T12:35:00.000Z	syivana	Wiesshund	ok
2010-08-02T12:35:00.000Z	Wiesshund	syivana	if ubuntu is 32bit you will use 32bit debs
2010-08-02T12:36:00.000Z	Wiesshund	syivana	unless you add repositories through synaptic it wont accidently show you 64bit
2010-08-02T12:37:00.000Z	syivana	Wiesshund	Indeed, but I am referring to addon packages like limewire and vbox nonfree, for example
2010-08-02T12:37:00.000Z	syivana	Wiesshund	Where you have to choose 32 or 64. It seems I have been doing the right thing so far by dling 32bit debs for the 32bit OS
2010-08-02T12:38:00.000Z	Wiesshund	syivana	yea hand downloads gotta babysit yourself.
2010-08-02T12:59:00.000Z	Wiesshund	syivana	eh not sure, windows cant read etx4, but dunno under VM
