2009-09-13T16:18:00.000Z	jrib	Sidewinder1	you could have your reasons.  In that case, do as Sidewinder1 suggested
2011-04-21T21:45:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	jrib	Thanks! I didn't know that. I used it in Gutsy and it worked fine but that's nice to knoe!

2011-06-10T17:46:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	jrib	He said front-end.
2011-06-10T17:47:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	jrib	Then Synaptic is backend?
2011-06-10T17:47:00.000Z	jrib	Sidewinder1	synaptic is *another* front-end
2011-06-10T17:48:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	jrib	Guess I got my symantics mixed up, again, sorry.. :-)
2011-06-25T16:44:00.000Z	jrib	Sidewinder1	fix them...
2011-06-25T16:46:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	jrib	Waht is the apt-get for fixing broken packages?
2011-06-25T16:48:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	jrib	Many thanks; I stink at command line syntax; my lack of typing shills doesn't help, either.
2011-06-25T16:48:00.000Z	jrib	Sidewinder1	heh
2011-09-09T16:32:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	jrib	Kartagis Sounds like ubuntu has a max. of characters for psswd and he's wondering if there's a way to increase that, no?
2011-09-09T16:32:00.000Z	jrib	Sidewinder1	no that's not the issue
2011-09-09T16:32:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	jrib	Sorry, I misunderstood... :-(
2011-09-09T16:47:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	jrib	I'm not purposefully trying to be obtuse, nor am I trying to hassle you; does ubuntu have a maximum character limit of 8 for passwords?
2011-09-09T16:47:00.000Z	jrib	Sidewinder1	nope, but if one uses DES for the hash it truncates passwords to 8 characters.  With md5 passwords can be arbitrarily long.  See: http://www.gnu.org/s/libc/manual/html%5Fnode/crypt.html
2011-12-03T18:16:00.000Z	Sidewinder1	jrib	I'm pretty sure it's an ext. usb/esata drive.
