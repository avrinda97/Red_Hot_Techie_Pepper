2004-12-19T08:24:00.000Z	chet		net@ulappy:~ $ locate xfree86.conf
2004-12-19T08:24:00.000Z	chet		/var/lib/dpkg/info/xserver-xfree86.config
2004-12-19T08:24:00.000Z	chet		/usr/share/xresprobe/xfree86.conf
2004-12-19T08:25:00.000Z	chet		is it xorg, or xfree
2004-12-19T08:25:00.000Z	kirt		oops.. unless you're using warty.
2004-12-19T08:25:00.000Z	chet		yeah, im ewarty :)
2004-12-19T08:25:00.000Z	kirt	chet	Then it's usually /etc/X11/XF86Config or /etc/X11/XF86Config-4
2004-12-19T08:26:00.000Z	chet		so look for xfree-4?
2004-12-19T08:26:00.000Z	kirt	chet	Er, no.  I believe there's a mouse section in /etc/X11/XF86Config-4
2004-12-19T08:27:00.000Z	kirt		What are you trying to do, exactly?
2004-12-19T08:27:00.000Z	chet		thats it i think, i need to edit the mouse button #, then xmodmap
2004-12-19T08:27:00.000Z	chet		i have this funky trackball is lots of buttons
2004-12-19T08:28:00.000Z	chet		my wrist thanks me everyday
2004-12-19T08:30:00.000Z	kirt	chet	I've never had to muck with one of those so i couldn't tell you how to get it working.
2004-12-19T08:34:00.000Z	chet	kirt	i think i have to change z axis garbage, then xmodmap for the correct buttons, took some time but it worked in mepis, i expect the same here
