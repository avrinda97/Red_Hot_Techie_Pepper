2011-05-13T19:26:00.000Z	louhusson		I am trying to move a whole ubuntu system from one hard drive (about to fail) to another. I'm afraid I'll make a mistake. Is there someone who'd help me walk through the process?
2011-05-13T19:27:00.000Z	ThinkT510	louhusson	wrong factoid, sorry
2011-05-13T19:28:00.000Z	louhusson	ThinkT510	ah ok. I was wondering. What make it complex for me is that a) the source is NTFS and I want the destination to be ext4 and b) The original partition is around 160GB and the destination is 300GB
2011-05-13T19:29:00.000Z	ThinkT510	louhusson	source is ntfs? is this a wubi install?
2011-05-13T19:29:00.000Z	louhusson	ThinkT510	not sure, it was a while ago, but probably.
2011-05-13T19:31:00.000Z	ThinkT510	louhusson	i don't think you can do that for a wubi install
2011-05-13T19:32:00.000Z	louhusson	ThinkT510	ok. If I install a brand new system on the new hard drive, and then copy /home from the old to the new drive, will there be any issues?
2011-05-13T19:32:00.000Z	louhusson	ThinkT510	(apart from having to reinstall a bunch of software)
2011-05-13T19:32:00.000Z	ThinkT510	louhusson	not that i can think of, but i've never done that myself
2011-05-13T19:33:00.000Z	louhusson	ThinkT510	thanks.
2011-05-13T19:33:00.000Z	ThinkT510	louhusson	if the source is indeed from ntfs then you may get issues from file permissions
2011-05-13T19:34:00.000Z	louhusson	ThinkT510	and if I just copy the entire contents of the NTFS partition to an ext4 partition, it won't boot?
2011-05-13T19:35:00.000Z	ThinkT510	louhusson	no it won't, file permissions are handled very differently on unix-like systems (which is why you can't install linux on ntfs)
2011-05-13T19:38:00.000Z	ThinkT510	louhusson	it would be a good idea to get a more experienced person's thoughts on the matter
2011-05-13T19:38:00.000Z	louhusson	ThinkT510	where can I find such people?
2011-05-13T19:39:00.000Z	ThinkT510	louhusson	they should be here at different times trying to help others
2011-05-13T19:39:00.000Z	louhusson	ThinkT510	ok, I'll hang around then. thank you :)
2011-05-13T19:39:00.000Z	ThinkT510	louhusson	no worries :)
