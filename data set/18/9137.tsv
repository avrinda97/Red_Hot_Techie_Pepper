2008-12-21T12:16:00.000Z	Hemebond		Is there any way to set the video-out as the primary display device?
2008-12-21T12:16:00.000Z	Hemebond		If the onboard video is stuffed?
2008-12-21T12:17:00.000Z	ziroday	Hemebond	is the video-out PCI or what?
2008-12-21T12:18:00.000Z	Hemebond	ziroday	It's a laptop.
2008-12-21T12:18:00.000Z	ziroday	Hemebond	erm, perhaps I am misunderstanding. When you say video-out you mean what?
2008-12-21T12:19:00.000Z	ziroday	Hemebond	do you mean the laptop monitor is broken and you want to use an externel monitor?
2008-12-21T12:19:00.000Z	Hemebond	ziroday	The VGA output port on the back. Basically the laptop screen is stuffed, and we are having trouble getting things to use the external monitor. Currently using Knoppix, but X fails. Downloading Ubuntu right now to try that.
2008-12-21T12:20:00.000Z	ziroday	Hemebond	okay. well ubuntu should appear on both screens
2008-12-21T12:20:00.000Z	Hemebond	ziroday	Assuming X starts.
2008-12-21T12:20:00.000Z	ziroday	Hemebond	of course :), however you should get a terminal on both screens/monitors.
2008-12-21T12:21:00.000Z	Hemebond	ziroday	Yeah, we have a terminal already.
2008-12-21T12:21:00.000Z	Hemebond	ziroday	The user is not used to Linux or CLI though.
2008-12-21T12:21:00.000Z	ziroday	Hemebond	okay, what video card do you have?
2008-12-21T12:23:00.000Z	ziroday	Hemebond	okay, so you have a nvidia card that you want to go the external monitor correct?
2008-12-21T12:27:00.000Z	ziroday	Hemebond	no ethernet connections?
2008-12-21T12:28:00.000Z	Hemebond	ziroday	Yeah, it gives itself a 127.0 address, and the router doesn't see it at all.
2008-12-21T12:29:00.000Z	ziroday	Hemebond	hmm? When you're connected to ethernet by a default ubuntu install it should assign you an IP address unless you have some odd router settings
2008-12-21T12:31:00.000Z	Hemebond	ziroday	Right now it's in Knoppix. Still downloading Ubuntu. And yes, it should be able to get an IP.
