2006-12-24T15:14:00.000Z	bingnet922		Quick question, where can I read about compiling FFMPEG with lame (in order to convert to FLV with MP3 audio)? I'm using Edgy.
2006-12-24T15:14:00.000Z	bruenig	bingnet922	you are certain that can even be done?
2006-12-24T15:15:00.000Z	bingnet922	bruenig	I have found some info here: http://po-ru.com/diary/fixing-ffmpeg-on-ubuntu/
2006-12-24T15:17:00.000Z	bruenig	bingnet922	what problems are you running into following that
2006-12-24T15:18:00.000Z	bingnet922	bruenig	very first line, can't build dependencies for ffmpeg
2006-12-24T15:19:00.000Z	bruenig	bingnet922	what do you get when you do that? what error?
2006-12-24T15:21:00.000Z	bingnet922	bruenig	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/38706/
2006-12-24T15:21:00.000Z	bruenig	bingnet922	you must do sudo apt-get build-dep ffmpeg, not sure if that is what the error is about but it could be
2006-12-24T15:22:00.000Z	bingnet922	bruenig	I ran is as root
2006-12-24T15:23:00.000Z	bruenig	bingnet922	that error doesn't show up anytime else? It doesn't look like a problem that would be unique to just one package
2006-12-24T15:23:00.000Z	bingnet922	bruenig	first occurence
2006-12-24T15:24:00.000Z	bruenig	bingnet922	well, have you looked for that file, see what its deal is
2006-12-24T15:24:00.000Z	bruenig	bingnet922	perhaps a sudo apt-get update will cure it
2006-12-24T15:33:00.000Z	bingnet922	bruenig	I restored /etc/apt/sources.list.d/edgy-universe.list from a backup and that quieted errors in synaptic, I ran $apt-get update and it completed successfully, I get the same error when I run $apt-get build-dep ffmpeg
2006-12-24T15:33:00.000Z	bruenig	bingnet922	is the file it says doesn't exist there or not?
2006-12-24T15:49:00.000Z	bingnet922	bruenig	the error now reads http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/38711/
2006-12-24T15:50:00.000Z	bruenig	bingnet922	unable to find source package would seem to indicate you don't have the deb-src repo enabled
