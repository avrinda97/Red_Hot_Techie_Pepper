2006-12-12T17:07:00.000Z	klotho		it said it was gksudo, so I killed that and the install is still there
2006-12-12T17:08:00.000Z	klotho		how do I do a net install of desktop?
2006-12-12T17:09:00.000Z	klotho		why when I killed the process did it not go away?
2006-12-12T17:10:00.000Z	klotho		i just used system monitor
2006-12-12T17:12:00.000Z	nothlit	klotho	what did you try to kill?
2006-12-12T17:20:00.000Z	nothlit	klotho	use the other disc then
2006-12-12T17:22:00.000Z	nothlit	klotho	a livecd takes more
2006-12-12T17:22:00.000Z	nothlit	klotho	you should be fine with the alternate install
2006-12-12T17:22:00.000Z	klotho	nothlit	how about actually running it?
2006-12-12T17:23:00.000Z	nothlit	klotho	it might be possible, if not you can use xubuntu
2006-12-12T17:25:00.000Z	nothlit	klotho	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RecycleOldHardware?highlight=%28minimum%29%7C%28requirements%29#head-88bede6f53b30a9a033c9ab56e1d898aa9057eec
2006-12-12T17:36:00.000Z	nothlit	klotho	xubuntu is gtk based, everything that you run in gnome should be able to work with xubuntu
2006-12-12T17:36:00.000Z	nothlit	klotho	it basically is a more lightweight de, and comes with a more lightweight suite of apps
2006-12-12T17:38:00.000Z	nothlit	klotho	no, just the way it operates and the apps it includes
2006-12-12T17:38:00.000Z	nothlit	klotho	gnome uses gtk as well
2006-12-12T17:40:00.000Z	nothlit	klotho	you can still install any gnome apps you may miss
2006-12-12T17:40:00.000Z	nothlit	klotho	just log out, choose one of them in sessions, and log in
2006-12-12T17:45:00.000Z	nothlit	klotho	don't worry about it, those sorts of things require you to learn about mounting manually and idesk... just stick with xubuntu or ubuntu for now
