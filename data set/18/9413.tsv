2007-04-11T15:08:00.000Z	penguifox		 How do I change my monitor hz from 60hz to 90hz? The normal way only allows 60hz :'(
2007-04-11T15:08:00.000Z	OpenTokix	penguifox	du you have a TFT?
2007-04-11T15:08:00.000Z	penguifox	OpenTokix	CRT
2007-04-11T15:09:00.000Z	OpenTokix	penguifox	the HZ is decided from the vertical and horizontal refresh rates in the X11.conf
2007-04-11T15:10:00.000Z	penguifox	OpenTokix	So how do I change the hz?
2007-04-11T15:10:00.000Z	OpenTokix	penguifox	you have to edit the vert and horiz refresh rates in the X11config
2007-04-11T15:11:00.000Z	penguifox	OpenTokix	the file is read only (?)
2007-04-11T15:11:00.000Z	OpenTokix	penguifox	you have to do it as root
2007-04-11T15:11:00.000Z	OpenTokix	penguifox	but it's a bad idea if you don't know what your doing -
2007-04-11T15:12:00.000Z	OpenTokix	penguifox	maybe there is some gui for it - lemme boot up my ubuntu
2007-04-11T15:12:00.000Z	OpenTokix	penguifox	booting in vmware =)
2007-04-11T15:14:00.000Z	OpenTokix	penguifox	You can only select 60Hz on in the "screen Resolution Preferences"-dialog?
2007-04-11T15:14:00.000Z	OpenTokix	penguifox	ok...
2007-04-11T15:16:00.000Z	OpenTokix	penguifox	sorry, I don't know how to do it with gui'stuff - only by editing files. - But you might break stuff if you edit files.
2007-04-11T15:16:00.000Z	penguifox	OpenTokix	can you send me a modified version of xorg.conf?
2007-04-11T15:16:00.000Z	OpenTokix	penguifox	I dont know the values for your monitor
2007-04-11T15:17:00.000Z	penguifox	OpenTokix	How would I find those out for you?
2007-04-11T15:17:00.000Z	OpenTokix	penguifox	I dont know - but I don't have time for that, sorry
