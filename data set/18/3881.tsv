2010-04-03T00:53:00.000Z	shazbotmcnasty		hes SUPER NOOB
2010-04-03T00:54:00.000Z	guntbert	shazbotmcnasty	your computer or his?
2010-04-03T00:54:00.000Z	shazbotmcnasty	guntbert	his
2010-04-03T00:56:00.000Z	guntbert	shazbotmcnasty	ouch, that makes it difficult - tell him to reboot in recovery mode (he might have to press <shift> during boot to see the menu where he can choose...)
2010-04-03T00:56:00.000Z	shazbotmcnasty	guntbert	k what next?
2010-04-03T00:58:00.000Z	guntbert	shazbotmcnasty	in the recovery menu select "root shell" -- and when he is there ask here again - that would be too many steps without confirmation
2010-04-03T00:58:00.000Z	shazbotmcnasty	guntbert	when he logs in, there is no password
2010-04-03T01:01:00.000Z	guntbert	shazbotmcnasty	does he know the user name?
2010-04-03T01:02:00.000Z	shazbotmcnasty	guntbert	omg, he's got to reboot again to remember his username
2010-04-03T01:03:00.000Z	guntbert	shazbotmcnasty	ok
2010-04-03T01:03:00.000Z	shazbotmcnasty	guntbert	okay he's got it, what's the next step :)
2010-04-03T01:03:00.000Z	shazbotmcnasty	guntbert	you do 'passwd username' ?
2010-04-03T01:04:00.000Z	guntbert	shazbotmcnasty	exactly
