2005-10-18T14:22:00.000Z	dooglus		are ubuntu packages 'signed'?
2005-10-18T14:24:00.000Z	onkarshinde	dooglus	apt-get checks the packages for integrity before installing them
2005-10-18T14:25:00.000Z	dooglus	onkarshinde	it does?  that's good
2005-10-18T14:26:00.000Z	onkarshinde	dooglus	If you are installing from some extra repos apt-get install will tell you that package is not authenticated. You can add extra repos' signature also.
2005-10-18T14:27:00.000Z	dooglus	onkarshinde	when you say "extra", do you mean like "universe" and "multiverse"?
2005-10-18T14:27:00.000Z	dooglus	onkarshinde	or do you mean unofficial repos?
2005-10-18T14:28:00.000Z	onkarshinde	dooglus	Not sure about those two. May be signatures for them are not added by default. I was talking about breezy-extras or something like that.
2005-10-19T16:11:00.000Z	onkarshinde	dooglus	Any specific security problem you faced with Linux?

2005-10-19T16:51:00.000Z	onkarshinde	dooglus	Launchpad is for translation
2005-11-16T17:10:00.000Z	dooglus	onkarshinde	because ubuntu's releases are stable.  they don't get changed after release other than for security or other important fixes
2005-11-16T17:10:00.000Z	onkarshinde	dooglus	I am talking about OOo2 hwich is RC in Breezy
2005-11-16T17:11:00.000Z	dooglus	onkarshinde	when breezy was released, OO.o2 wasn't.
2005-11-16T17:15:00.000Z	dooglus	onkarshinde	'tar cfz' creates a gzipped tar file
2005-11-16T17:17:00.000Z	onkarshinde	dooglus	no
2005-11-16T17:18:00.000Z	dooglus	onkarshinde	no what?
2005-11-16T17:18:00.000Z	onkarshinde	dooglus	shinu: I think I am getting hungry. So giving answers in hurry.
