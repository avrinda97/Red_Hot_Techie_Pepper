2010-04-30T12:04:00.000Z	Leapo		eh?
2010-04-30T12:05:00.000Z	Leapo		er...yeah...
2010-04-30T12:05:00.000Z	Leapo		Anyway, I've got Ubuntu 10.04 installed to a flash drive, and it's slow as dirt. It took 10 minutes to boot
2010-04-30T12:05:00.000Z	Leapo		is there anything I can do to reduce that? I notice it spends a lot of time detecting devices that aren't there
2010-04-30T12:06:00.000Z	Leapo		That's what's wrong :-P
2010-04-30T12:06:00.000Z	Leapo		It actually boots slower than the live CD
2010-04-30T12:07:00.000Z	Leapo		Like...a live CD with a persistant file on a flash drive might actually be faster than running from the flash drive
2010-04-30T12:07:00.000Z	gartral	Leapo	are you using a usb 1.1 drve/jack or 2.0? also, is AHCI setup in your BIOS?
2010-04-30T12:08:00.000Z	Leapo	gartral	The laptop's ports are USB 1.1 only. No way around that. AHCI won't do jack for USB flash drives.
2010-04-30T12:08:00.000Z	gartral	Leapo	then stop complaining about ubuntu being slow as dirt when it's your laptop that's slow.. not ubuntu
2010-04-30T12:08:00.000Z	Leapo	gartral	I'm asking if there's a way to FIX it. Yeesh!
2010-04-30T12:09:00.000Z	Leapo	gartral	Anything I could possibly do to help it out.
2010-04-30T12:10:00.000Z	gartral	Leapo	ohh, sorry, i misinterpreted the statments. i think you can use a linux=toram at boot and make the iso copy to ram then run.. but i wpuldnt do this if you have under a gig and a half.. as far as post-install/setup caching goes, not sure
2010-04-30T12:11:00.000Z	Leapo	gartral	I don't remember how much RAM this laptop has. it's either 1GB of 512mb...
2010-04-30T12:11:00.000Z	gartral	Leapo	1.5gig ram that is
2010-04-30T12:11:00.000Z	Leapo	gartral	That's why i was thinking about some kind of prefetch service that would load data into RAM to speed things up.
2010-04-30T12:12:00.000Z	gartral	Leapo	i think your biggest issue now would be get more ram
2010-04-30T12:12:00.000Z	Leapo	gartral	Or a USB 2.0 PCMCIA card? :-P
