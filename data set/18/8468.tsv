2007-09-02T05:03:00.000Z	jrib	n0ur	you are telling virtualbox to mount an ubuntu iso so you can install it?
2007-09-02T05:06:00.000Z	jrib	n0ur	power down the virtual machine, go to settings, then tell it to mount that iso as the cdrom
2007-09-02T05:10:00.000Z	jrib	n0ur	is it booting the cd?
2007-09-02T05:11:00.000Z	jrib	n0ur	erm, I mean iso
2007-09-02T05:11:00.000Z	jrib	n0ur	yeah, you can just tell it to mount the iso
2007-09-02T05:13:00.000Z	jrib	n0ur	but do you see that it is actually trying to load it when you boot the virtual machine?
2007-09-02T05:13:00.000Z	jrib	n0ur	hmm, what iso are you using?
2007-09-02T05:14:00.000Z	n0ur	jrib	ubuntu-7.04-desktop-i386.iso
2007-09-02T05:14:00.000Z	jrib	n0ur	version of virtualbox?
2007-09-02T05:16:00.000Z	jrib	n0ur	try ugprading to 1.5.0
