2011-05-16T16:31:00.000Z	szal	DasEi	GDM is not a window manager
2011-05-16T16:31:00.000Z	szal	DasEi	neither are KDM or XDM
2011-05-16T16:33:00.000Z	DasEi	szal	gives you a basic desktop without ubuntu-desktop, am I wrong ? it's a displaymanager
2011-05-16T16:33:00.000Z	szal	DasEi	indeed, these are display managers, and for starting X you don't necessarily need one
2011-07-04T15:00:00.000Z	szal	DasEi	either that, or it's not executable (which would be quite rare)
2011-07-04T15:01:00.000Z	DasEi	szal	nickmiss ?
2011-07-04T15:01:00.000Z	szal	DasEi	damn, I can't nick-complete today..
2011-07-04T15:01:00.000Z	DasEi	szal	lol, nvm , di mas
2011-07-08T14:12:00.000Z	DasEi	szal	C:\ubuntu and C:\wubildr*
2011-07-08T14:15:00.000Z	szal	DasEi	doesn't entirely answer the question; but the Wubi FAQ suggests that Wubi indeed runs *buntu from a virtual disk
2011-07-08T14:15:00.000Z	DasEi	szal	yes, it does
2011-07-08T14:16:00.000Z	DasEi	szal	like a mounted image
2011-07-08T14:17:00.000Z	DasEi	szal	there are ways to recover files from wubi, f.e. it crashed
2011-07-08T14:22:00.000Z	DasEi	szal	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1639198
2011-07-08T14:23:00.000Z	szal	DasEi	don't poke me, I don't run a Wubi thingy ;)
2011-07-08T14:23:00.000Z	szal	DasEi	and clean your glasses ;)
2011-07-08T14:24:00.000Z	DasEi	szal	first thing if you have a bad wubi not starting would be defrag of win's ntfs
