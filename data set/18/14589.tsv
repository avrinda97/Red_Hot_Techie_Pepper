2005-07-20T10:51:00.000Z	Gourami		Hi all, is it possible to switch one of the workspaces to an external screen and one of the workspaces to the monitor of a laptop ?

2005-07-20T10:53:00.000Z	delire	Gourami	kind of ;)
2005-07-20T10:54:00.000Z	delire	Gourami	xinerama is a slightly different approach, and really extends one workspace across two screens
2005-07-20T10:54:00.000Z	delire	Gourami	but the 'workspace' is an extended desktop
2005-07-20T10:57:00.000Z	delire	Gourami	this would be nice, i have never looked into this.
2005-07-20T10:59:00.000Z	Gourami	delire	have you used xinerama, I have tried to man both xinerama and libxinerama (which shows installed in synaptic) but no response
2005-07-20T10:59:00.000Z	delire	Gourami	yes i have, though years ago. i followed this howto. http://linuxreviews.org/howtos/xfree/Xinerama-HOWTO/en/index.html
2005-08-02T11:21:00.000Z	delire	Gourami	have you tried 'mplayer dvd://'?
2005-08-02T11:21:00.000Z	Gourami	delire	?
2005-08-02T11:23:00.000Z	Gourami	delire	MPlayer interrupted by signal 11 in module: decode_audio
2005-08-02T11:23:00.000Z	delire	Gourami	ouch.. and this same dvd plays in vlc?
2005-08-02T11:23:00.000Z	Gourami	delire	yes
2005-08-02T11:25:00.000Z	delire	Gourami	apparently this is a known problem. psychonate has posted the exact same issue: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=46138&highlight=mplayer+dvd+crash
2005-08-02T11:32:00.000Z	delire	Gourami	ogg or xvid
2005-08-02T11:35:00.000Z	delire	Gourami	it provides header information largely, and regulates playback. you probably know it as format yes.
2005-08-02T11:51:00.000Z	delire	Gourami	sudo == do as super-user (or "super user do"). this is used for executing commands that require administrative priveledges.
2005-08-02T11:52:00.000Z	Gourami	delire	topyli it was working up untill now without sudo, will restart a bit later
