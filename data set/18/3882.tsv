2010-04-21T08:12:00.000Z	SpaceCowboy40404		I am trying to move a file to my root directory and im having problems, can someone give me a hand please?
2010-04-21T08:12:00.000Z	switch10_	SpaceCowboy40404	what is the error?
2010-04-21T08:14:00.000Z	switch10_	SpaceCowboy40404	it is in your home folder?
2010-04-21T08:14:00.000Z	switch10_	SpaceCowboy40404	where is the file??
2010-04-21T08:15:00.000Z	switch10_	SpaceCowboy40404	so mv that to the dest
2010-04-21T08:16:00.000Z	switch10_	SpaceCowboy40404	show me exactly what you typed
2010-04-21T08:16:00.000Z	switch10_	SpaceCowboy40404	and do pwd to see what dir you are in..
2010-04-21T08:17:00.000Z	switch10_	SpaceCowboy40404	ls will tell you what is in your current working dir..
2010-04-21T08:18:00.000Z	switch10_	SpaceCowboy40404	got it??
2010-04-21T08:20:00.000Z	switch10_	SpaceCowboy40404	lets you execute the file
2010-04-21T08:21:00.000Z	switch10_	SpaceCowboy40404	chmod changes permissions.
2010-04-21T08:22:00.000Z	switch10_	SpaceCowboy40404	nope the way you wrote it you could be in any dir because it uses the full path to the file.
2010-04-21T08:23:00.000Z	switch10_	SpaceCowboy40404	cd /usr/bin  then  ls
2010-04-21T08:23:00.000Z	switch10_	SpaceCowboy40404	you could do that as well
2010-04-21T08:26:00.000Z	switch10_	SpaceCowboy40404	mv also renames, so do mv ventrilo_sr ventrilo_srv
2010-04-21T08:28:00.000Z	switch10_	SpaceCowboy40404	yup that happens when you are noy in /home
2010-04-21T08:31:00.000Z	switch10_	SpaceCowboy40404	changing ownership
2010-04-21T08:32:00.000Z	switch10_	SpaceCowboy40404	it changes the owner and the group of the file
