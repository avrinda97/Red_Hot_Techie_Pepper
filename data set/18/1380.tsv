2011-08-17T20:18:00.000Z	coldboot|home		How do you fix the window resize lag for "Normal" mode in the new version of compiz that comes with Ubuntu 11.04?
2011-08-17T20:19:00.000Z	coldboot|home		I'm asking there, too.
2011-08-17T20:19:00.000Z	coldboot|home		By the way the new Unity Desktop sucks and shouldn't be forced on upgrade.
2011-08-17T20:20:00.000Z	coldboot|home		I can see it's an attempt to imitate Mac's interface, but it's too crappy to force on users when they upgrade, just like pulseaudio was.
2011-08-17T20:21:00.000Z	coldboot|home		I was already using Ubuntu, and it automatically switched to Unity when I upgraded to 11.04. On my machine at work, for some reason it didn't do this.
2011-08-17T20:21:00.000Z	coldboot|home		My point is you shouldn't force the switch when a user upgrades, even if they can change it later.
2011-08-17T20:21:00.000Z	coldboot|home		How fortunate.
2011-08-17T20:22:00.000Z	coldboot|home		You could present users with a screen allowing them to choose.
2011-08-17T20:22:00.000Z	Polah	coldboot|home	there is. Session menu at the login screen.
2011-08-17T20:24:00.000Z	Polah	coldboot|home	I've noticed Unity copied all my GNOME panel launchers...
2011-08-17T20:29:00.000Z	Polah	coldboot|home	like ikonia said, it was presented in 11.04
2011-08-17T20:29:00.000Z	coldboot|home	Polah	How was it presented to the user?
2011-08-17T20:30:00.000Z	Polah	coldboot|home	yeah. What do you consider as it being presented?
2011-08-17T20:31:00.000Z	coldboot|home	Polah	Showing the user some screen that says "Would you like to try the new Ubuntu Unity desktop?", similar to how Gmail says "Try the new interface", or Google Chrome says "Select your default search engine" when the option to choose those things becomes available.
2011-08-17T20:33:00.000Z	Polah	coldboot|home	it's obviously what Canonical thought was the way forward. It's not like they're saying "You can ONLY use Unity and nothing else."
2011-08-17T20:33:00.000Z	coldboot|home	Polah	I'm not saying they're saying that, I'm saying they shouldn't default people so unfinished software without giving them the choice.
2011-08-17T20:34:00.000Z	Polah	coldboot|home	There is a choice. You have the choice to move  to another environment if you don't like Unity.
2011-08-17T20:35:00.000Z	coldboot|home	Polah	Sure, there is the after-the-fact choice. Give the users a choice before you disrupt their user experience.
