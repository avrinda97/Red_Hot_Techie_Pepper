2012-01-03T05:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bfri	its a desktop WM but can also run without a DE
2012-01-03T05:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bfri	its a WM, but can run without DE
2012-01-03T06:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bfri	lubuntu is ubuntu but with LXDEand openbox instead of Gnome and compiz
2012-01-03T06:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bfri	lxde is a desktop, openbox is a window manager
2012-01-03T06:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bfri	openbox is the WM
2012-01-03T06:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bfri	the WM draws the windows, compiz is a WM
2012-01-03T06:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bfri	openbox, but it doesn't do all the dumb compiz effects, its a no nonsense WM
2012-01-03T06:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bfri	lubuntu is a billion times slicker and lighter
2012-01-03T06:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bfri	its the same OS, it just uses lighter apps by default, so not much
2012-01-03T06:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	bfri	try it, you'll see the deal
