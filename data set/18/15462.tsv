2007-04-07T09:14:00.000Z	cafuego_	dak	sudo apt-get install kubuntu-desktop
2007-04-07T09:16:00.000Z	cafuego_	dak	Somewhat more up-to-date desktop-relevant packages.
2007-04-07T09:17:00.000Z	cafuego_	dak	Not really.
2007-04-07T09:17:00.000Z	cafuego_	dak	Whenever a release is made, a new testing is forked off. there is no perprtual unstable.
2007-04-07T09:19:00.000Z	cafuego_	dak	So it conveniently fits onto a single CD iso. Just a matter of naming.
2007-04-07T09:20:00.000Z	cafuego_	dak	Anyway, with ubuntu, if you run `stable', you end up with pretty new packages and a certain amount of stability. It doesn't break in some of the major ways sid does sometimes.
2007-04-07T09:21:00.000Z	cafuego_	dak	Releases are scheduled to be a month and a bit after Gnome releases, so you end up always using the latest stable gnome.
2007-04-07T09:21:00.000Z	cafuego_	dak	Well, for example the sid pam brokenness from 2005 - you won't get that :-)
2007-04-07T09:21:00.000Z	cafuego_	dak	Yes, I'm running it now.
2007-04-07T09:22:00.000Z	cafuego_	dak	Yup, there are amd64 isos.
2007-04-07T09:23:00.000Z	cafuego_	dak	http://releases.ubuntu.com/feisty/ubuntu-7.04-beta-alternate-amd64.iso
2007-04-07T09:23:00.000Z	cafuego_	dak	The `alternative' use d-i, not that livecd monstrosity.
2007-04-07T09:23:00.000Z	cafuego_	dak	No, as it's not stable yet.
