2010-09-09T04:14:00.000Z	yva		anyone to help with priv/pub keys authentification?
2010-09-09T04:16:00.000Z	yva		I'm trying to login using private and public keys, it not working. I added my public key to .ssh/authorized_keys and activated RSAAuth and PubkeyAuth in sshd_config, anything else I need to do?
2010-09-09T04:16:00.000Z	yva		jrib> /etc/init.d/ssh reload ?
2010-09-09T04:17:00.000Z	yva		jrib> yep
2010-09-09T04:17:00.000Z	yva		I haven't change RSAAuth etc
2010-09-09T04:18:00.000Z	yva		dberry> what should they be?
2010-09-09T04:19:00.000Z	yva		dberry> drwxr-xr-x on ./ssh
2010-09-09T04:19:00.000Z	yva		dberry> not sure what you mean
2010-09-09T04:20:00.000Z	madfox	yva	ssh -v
2010-09-09T04:20:00.000Z	yva		jrib> -rw-------
2010-09-09T04:21:00.000Z	yva		dberry> got a long debug
2010-09-09T04:23:00.000Z	yva		dberry> it was looking for an id_dsa??
2010-09-09T04:25:00.000Z	yva		jrib> it's ok but now it says Permissions 0644 for '/home/yva/.ssh/id_dsa' are too open.
2010-09-09T04:26:00.000Z	yva		dberry> it now again ask for a password
2010-09-09T04:27:00.000Z	yva	jrib	dberry I don't get why it's asking for id_dsa?
2010-09-09T04:28:00.000Z	yva		jrib> yup
2010-09-09T04:28:00.000Z	yva		it's now now even giving the error msg
2010-09-09T04:29:00.000Z	madfox	yva	typically no error with linux means a complete success of what it was trying to do(maybe not what you wanted it to do though)
