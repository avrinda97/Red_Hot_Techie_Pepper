2009-07-13T17:35:00.000Z	janisozaur	minimec	there is a difference between "PSHUFD" and "PSHUFD site:http://www.ews.uiuc.edu/~cjiang/reference/"
2009-07-13T17:17:00.000Z	minimec	janisozaur	Yes there is. Go into the search line of google.com for example, '?right click' set keyword.'
2009-07-13T17:18:00.000Z	minimec	janisozaur	I use the keyword goo for google for example. For a google search I do <ctrl>l goo wifi jaunty for example
2009-07-13T17:20:00.000Z	janisozaur	minimec	thats nice, but i can't think of a way this could insert site: into the query without me entering it by hand
2009-07-13T17:20:00.000Z	janisozaur	minimec	like i'm browsing ubuntu.com, type "something" in search box and it would go to google with the query: "something site:ubuntu.com"
2009-07-13T17:22:00.000Z	minimec	janisozaur	So you would like to search ubuntu.com for the keyword 'something'?
2009-07-13T17:22:00.000Z	janisozaur	minimec	that was just an example, but yes

2009-07-13T17:24:00.000Z	minimec	janisozaur	You can add a keyword for all searches you want. So if ubuntu.com had a 'search engine' (it has), you could give that the 'ubu' keyword and do a 'ubu something' search.
2009-07-13T17:24:00.000Z	minimec	janisozaur	That's the best option I can give you.
2009-07-13T17:24:00.000Z	janisozaur	minimec	i want to use it for sites that do not have search engines, thats the point
2009-07-13T17:25:00.000Z	minimec	janisozaur	I see what you mean. So what's the problem of typing <ctrl>l iraq site:cnn.com
2009-07-13T17:27:00.000Z	janisozaur	minimec	it's at least 13 letters to type more for that short an url
2009-07-13T17:34:00.000Z	minimec	janisozaur	Again I see what you mean. All I can say is, that the firefox keyword feature is one of the most important for me and I see not a hugh difference in searching for 'iraq sites: cnn.com' and 'cnn iraq', using the keyword feature in combination with the cnn search engine. If thete is no search engine, indeed you would have to 'iraq sites:somepage.net
2010-10-20T19:57:00.000Z	minimec	janisozaur	<ctrl><alt>c in gnome-terminal
2010-10-20T19:57:00.000Z	janisozaur	minimec	that's not cli
2010-10-20T19:57:00.000Z	minimec	janisozaur	no ctrl shift +c
2010-10-20T19:57:00.000Z	minimec	janisozaur	YOu are right.
