2009-11-18T07:09:00.000Z	jordy240		i am trying to shrink my ubuntu partition but gparted said something about there not being a supported superblock or something. can someone please help?
2009-11-18T07:09:00.000Z	centHOGG	jordy240	ever shrunk one before?
2009-11-18T07:10:00.000Z	jordy240	centHOGG	yes
2009-11-18T07:11:00.000Z	centHOGG	jordy240	ok what is the filesystem type
2009-11-18T07:11:00.000Z	jordy240	centHOGG	whatever ubuntu puts on my hard drive
2009-11-18T07:12:00.000Z	centHOGG	jordy240	yeah
2009-11-18T07:12:00.000Z	centHOGG	jordy240	i've never had any luck with ext3... but no problems with reiserfs
2009-11-18T07:12:00.000Z	jordy240	centHOGG	what do you mean?
2009-11-18T07:12:00.000Z	centHOGG	jordy240	ever tried acronis
2009-11-18T07:13:00.000Z	jordy240	centHOGG	I don't know what that is.
2009-11-18T07:13:00.000Z	centHOGG	jordy240	a partition resizer
2009-11-18T07:13:00.000Z	jordy240	centHOGG	I have a question for you: how can I move empty space from under my ntfs partition to OVER my ntfs partition so I can grow my swap
2009-11-18T07:14:00.000Z	centHOGG	jordy240	yes it's possible to do that in acronis.... ext3 is a pain see
2009-11-18T07:15:00.000Z	jordy240	centHOGG	well I have no more black cd's. is aconis free and work on ubuntu?
2009-11-18T07:15:00.000Z	centHOGG	jordy240	unfortunately no... it's commercial. but its great to have
2009-11-18T07:18:00.000Z	centHOGG	jordy240	if you have to redo that system... next time use reiserfs for the filesystem, because you can adjust it much easier
2009-11-18T07:18:00.000Z	jordy240	centHOGG	i have to reinstall ubutu?
