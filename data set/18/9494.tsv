2009-01-01T12:33:00.000Z	insta		Anyone have an idea about my ALSA versioning? :(
2009-01-01T12:35:00.000Z	raylu	insta	install it from source?
2009-01-01T12:35:00.000Z	insta	raylu	is it just as simple as grabbing the newest alsa-driver, ./configure ; make ; make install ?
2009-01-01T12:36:00.000Z	raylu	insta	if only it were always that simple. the short answer is yes
2009-01-01T12:37:00.000Z	insta	raylu	have you installed alsa from source before?  your lead-in scares me :(
2009-01-01T12:38:00.000Z	raylu	insta	no. but installing things from source can occasionally have lots of annoying things you have to do
2009-01-01T13:03:00.000Z	raylu	insta	you tell us what you did :D
2009-01-01T13:04:00.000Z	insta	raylu	http://www.alsa-project.org/main/index.php/Main_Page  ... i downloaded the 'current versions' of everything there, unpacked them to separate folders in my home folder, and effectively did "./configure ; make ; make install" to each one
2009-01-01T13:05:00.000Z	insta	raylu	although i didn't do --with-cards=all on alsa-driver's ./configure
2009-01-01T13:05:00.000Z	raylu	insta	did you uninstall alsa before doing this?
2009-01-01T13:06:00.000Z	insta	raylu	that's probably one of those things i should have done, eh?
2009-01-01T13:06:00.000Z	raylu	insta	you can try make uninsall
2009-01-01T13:08:00.000Z	raylu	insta	the packages most likely installed to / and you most likely installed to /usr/local
2009-01-01T13:11:00.000Z	insta	raylu	meh, it's hosed :(
2009-01-01T13:12:00.000Z	raylu	insta	uninstall didn't work?
2009-01-01T13:12:00.000Z	insta	raylu	even worse, i see stuff from 'HDA Intel' in my dmesg when the system boots
2009-01-01T13:12:00.000Z	raylu	insta	reintsall alsa
2009-01-01T13:21:00.000Z	insta	raylu	installing another sound card made alsa see all 3 cards again ...
