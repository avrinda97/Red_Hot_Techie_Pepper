2007-09-08T12:37:00.000Z	nickrud	ubuntu23	you know that vmware-server is available from the feisty-commercial repo?
2007-09-08T12:38:00.000Z	ubuntu23	nickrud	yeah i know. how much better is workstation?  maybe it would be worth going for server
2007-09-08T12:39:00.000Z	nickrud	ubuntu23	Can't you try workstation for a limited time?
2007-09-08T12:40:00.000Z	ubuntu23	nickrud	i already have already used workstation.  i just haven't used server
2007-09-08T12:41:00.000Z	nickrud	ubuntu23	it's only an apt-get away for testing
2007-09-08T12:42:00.000Z	nickrud	ubuntu23	I'd be interested in your experiences ;)
2007-09-08T12:42:00.000Z	ubuntu23	nickrud	i am configuring my system to dual boot both windows xp and xubuntu, and be able to virtualize both from the other
2007-09-08T12:42:00.000Z	nickrud	ubuntu23	the actual partitions, or just images?
2007-09-08T12:43:00.000Z	ubuntu23	nickrud	the actual partitions

2007-09-08T12:44:00.000Z	ubuntu23	nickrud	the reason i'm doing it is that no linux user on my campus has been able to connect to the wireless network (crazy encryption, authentication, stuff like that), and i want to be able to use the wireless network while using linux
2007-09-08T12:45:00.000Z	nickrud	ubuntu23	that's a legitimate reason, but I don't think the reason has to be legit, it's just elegant
2007-09-08T12:48:00.000Z	ubuntu23	nickrud	can vmware server really be installed through apt?  i don't see it as an available package
2007-09-08T12:49:00.000Z	nickrud	ubuntu23	add deb http://archive.canonical.com/ubuntu feisty-commercial main
2007-09-08T12:53:00.000Z	ubuntu23	nickrud	are vmware tools not available through apt?
2007-09-08T12:56:00.000Z	nickrud	ubuntu23	I remember there being some kernel modules with tools in the name (I'm on gutsy)
2007-09-08T12:56:00.000Z	ubuntu23	nickrud	yeah i see the kernel modules.  would that be all i need to install?
2007-09-08T12:57:00.000Z	nickrud	ubuntu23	should be. I didn't really start using vmware until I was already on gutsy, had to use the vmware ones
