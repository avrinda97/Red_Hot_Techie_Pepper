2009-03-07T14:50:00.000Z	S_A		Hi! any idea how to make sure that all the Network data is encrypted in transit. ???
2009-03-07T14:50:00.000Z	daftykins	S_A	network data between where and where?
2009-03-07T14:52:00.000Z	daftykins		well i mean daft stuff like built-in webcams, finger print readers etc zcopley
2009-03-07T14:52:00.000Z	daftykins		are you in the US?
2009-03-07T14:52:00.000Z	S_A	daftykins	All the network data. be it firefox or any other application in local system. All the data out of my system should be encrypted. I have heard that IPSec and SSL is the way
2009-03-07T14:52:00.000Z	S_A	daftykins	but i do not know how to make it possible ?
2009-03-07T14:53:00.000Z	daftykins	S_A	IPSec is a type of VPN technology that you'd use to connect to somewhere safely from a public place, such as free internet in an internet cafe
2009-03-07T14:53:00.000Z	daftykins	S_A	there's no reason to use any kind of that encryption on your own home internet connection
2009-03-07T14:55:00.000Z	S_A	daftykins	I am trying to convince my finance/marketing department to switch to Linux. but this is the requirement they have putup
2009-03-07T14:56:00.000Z	daftykins	S_A	encryption needs to exist between two points, if i'm in a company and i'm using a desktop computer which uses an internet connection then there's no reason to implement encryption because there's no two places between me and the Internet that isn't safe, sorta, do you get me?
2009-03-07T14:57:00.000Z	S_A	daftykins	You are right.
2009-03-07T14:58:00.000Z	daftykins	S_A	i'd understand if maybe you had another office somewhere else and you needed to setup an IPSec VPN between the Internet-side routers of each one so that you could just network between the two
2009-03-07T14:59:00.000Z	S_A	daftykins	right. marketing ppl access intranet from outside
2009-03-07T15:00:00.000Z	daftykins	S_A	ah ok, that makes sense. do they get given laptops/PCs for home use to access the intranet from home?
2009-03-07T15:01:00.000Z	S_A	daftykins	yes
2009-03-07T15:02:00.000Z	daftykins	S_A	tbh the only thing i can think of would involve them being quite competent :D you might be better off googling around for that, i don't even know what i'd google for
2009-03-07T15:02:00.000Z	daftykins		something along the lines of "road warrior vpn"
2009-03-07T15:03:00.000Z	S_A	daftykins	:) ok
