2010-06-05T21:07:00.000Z	xynta_	HaakonKL	how do i do that?
2010-06-05T21:08:00.000Z	HaakonKL	xynta_	open a terminal and type "top" and you'll get a neat report saying which programs use what resources.
2010-06-05T21:08:00.000Z	xynta_	HaakonKL	it says that Xorg is using 16 % CPU
2010-06-05T21:08:00.000Z	HaakonKL	xynta_	a pretty good indicator of the offending program will be found that way.
2010-06-05T21:09:00.000Z	HaakonKL	xynta_	then your desktop is using a lot of resources somehow. Are you running any special effects or something similar
2010-06-05T21:09:00.000Z	xynta_	HaakonKL	im running "Normal" on visual effects
2010-06-05T21:10:00.000Z	HaakonKL	xynta_	If you shut all of them down, how's the cpu affected? (IT shouldn't have a huge impact, but you never know... :)
2010-06-05T21:11:00.000Z	xynta_	HaakonKL	it's still 16 and is still consuming much CPU usage
2010-06-05T21:11:00.000Z	HaakonKL	xynta_	That's really weird. At least we know that your desktop effects are not to blame.
2010-06-05T21:12:00.000Z	HaakonKL	xynta_	what do you run on your desktop then? compiz/gnome?
2010-06-05T21:12:00.000Z	xynta_	HaakonKL	compiz and gnome .. is it because of my graphic drivers?
2010-06-05T21:13:00.000Z	HaakonKL	xynta_	Not very likely. :) Did you recently install them, and then had these problems?
2010-06-05T21:13:00.000Z	HaakonKL	xynta_	Do you have an old machine byw?
2010-06-05T21:14:00.000Z	xynta_	HaakonKL	No, it's a new machine.. The CPU usage was higher before I installed the drivers ..
2010-06-05T21:15:00.000Z	HaakonKL	xynta_	Then it's not likely that then.
2010-06-05T21:17:00.000Z	HaakonKL	xynta_	It seems to be some similar issues on launchpad, but that's with older drivers... https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nvidia-graphics-drivers-96/+bug/178400
2010-06-05T21:18:00.000Z	HaakonKL	xynta_	Do you by any chance have an intel graphics card?
2010-06-05T21:18:00.000Z	xynta_	HaakonKL	no it's Radeon HD 5770
