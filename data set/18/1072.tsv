2012-02-22T21:23:00.000Z	Guest76002		greetings, I've been experiencing lag while playing videos, how do i fix this issue?
2012-02-22T21:24:00.000Z	rattatoue	Guest76002	do you have the latest video driver for your video card?
2012-02-22T21:24:00.000Z	Guest76002	rattatoue	i don't know - how do I check?
2012-02-22T21:25:00.000Z	rattatoue	Guest76002	do you know what your video card is first off?
2012-02-22T21:25:00.000Z	Guest76002	rattatoue	i don't know...
2012-02-22T21:25:00.000Z	Guest76002	rattatoue	how do i check
2012-02-22T21:25:00.000Z	Guest76002	rattatoue	what is the command?
2012-02-22T21:26:00.000Z	rattatoue	Guest76002	type lspci -v in the terminal and then half way up it says probably somthing like VGA compatiable controller and it should tell you what your card is
2012-02-22T21:29:00.000Z	rattatoue	Guest76002	okay look at that list and you should see something under that VGA part that says. Says "Kernel Driver in use:" whats it say for your ATI card?
2012-02-22T21:30:00.000Z	rattatoue	Guest76002	Im not real sure about ATI cards, but that sounds like the right driver for your card. Are you talking about videos on your computer or like youtube flash videos?
2012-02-22T21:30:00.000Z	Guest76002	rattatoue	that is correct
2012-02-22T21:30:00.000Z	Guest76002	rattatoue	streaming videos
2012-02-22T21:31:00.000Z	rattatoue	Guest76002	is it just one site or any flash site?
2012-02-22T21:31:00.000Z	Guest76002	rattatoue	i recall fixing this once - there was an issue with flash
2012-02-22T21:31:00.000Z	Guest76002	rattatoue	something about installling flash updates
2012-02-22T21:32:00.000Z	rattatoue	Guest76002	you can try running the update-manager check if there is a flash video update otherwise you will have to manually install it
2012-02-22T21:32:00.000Z	Guest76002	rattatoue	install flashaid, i think?
2012-02-22T21:33:00.000Z	rattatoue	Guest76002	your welcome to try that if you want, but honestly never used the program so I wouldnt know on that.
