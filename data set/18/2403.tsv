2010-06-18T05:35:00.000Z	toolbear		hello.  i have a file name "libstdc++.so.5".  if i want to "install" this library on my system, can I just put it in "/lib/" or "/usr/lib/", or do I have to configure something, or what?
2010-06-18T05:36:00.000Z	AAA	toolbear	 it is best to install the entire package. however, it _might_ work if you add it to /usr/lib and then do depmod -a
2010-06-18T05:37:00.000Z	toolbear	AAA	i don't have a debian package, i just have the file
2010-06-18T05:38:00.000Z	AAA	toolbear	 my guess is you will need the rest of the files in that package for your desired affect. the deb does exist, you may need to put backports in your sources.list, but it exists
2010-06-18T05:39:00.000Z	toolbear	AAA	aplund: there is no package.  it's just this file.  i'm trying to install the intel fortran compiler (because gfortran just doesn't work very well).  it says that i need to install libstdc++.so.5, and so i'm trying to figure out how to do so
2010-06-18T05:41:00.000Z	AAA	toolbear	 I'll betcha as soon as you figure out how to feed that to gfortran it will ask you for another file =p
2010-06-18T05:42:00.000Z	toolbear	AAA	you mean feed that to the intel compiler?  perhaps, but this is "step 1", i guess...
2010-06-18T05:43:00.000Z	AAA	toolbear	 have you tried putting it in /usr/lib and running depmod -a?
2010-06-18T05:44:00.000Z	toolbear	AAA	i didn't do "depmod -a" -- not sure what that does
2010-06-18T05:45:00.000Z	AAA	toolbear	 nm. I'm thinking of something else. depmod is for kernel modules
2010-06-18T05:46:00.000Z	toolbear	AAA	ah, ok.
2010-06-18T05:46:00.000Z	AAA	toolbear	 aplund yup. ldconfig
2010-06-18T05:48:00.000Z	AAA	toolbear	 you'll want to run that before you try and use the .so, wherever you decide to put it
2010-06-18T05:56:00.000Z	AAA	toolbear	 so your problem is the INSTALLER wants that file, correct?
2010-06-18T05:59:00.000Z	AAA	toolbear	 and the install still breaks after exporting tht path? with the same error?
2010-06-18T05:59:00.000Z	toolbear	AAA	yep, as if i had done nothing differently
2010-06-18T06:00:00.000Z	AAA	toolbear	 I know aplund doesn't think it wise, but it may be looking for it in a set path like /usr/lib.  I'd try if it were me, but that's me.
2010-06-18T06:01:00.000Z	toolbear	AAA	actually i already tried this before coming here...
