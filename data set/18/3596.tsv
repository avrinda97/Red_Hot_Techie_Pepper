2009-09-07T04:18:00.000Z	stickapotomus		well, damn. this channel is dead.
2009-09-07T04:18:00.000Z	sebsebseb	stickapotomus	not that busy right now, but  far from dead
2009-09-07T04:21:00.000Z	stickapotomus	sebsebseb	are you an admin of this channel?
2009-09-07T04:24:00.000Z	sebsebseb	stickapotomus	an op of this channal no
2009-09-07T04:24:00.000Z	sebsebseb	stickapotomus	why?
2009-09-07T04:24:00.000Z	stickapotomus	sebsebseb	just curious. this is my first foray into ubuntu and was wondering how this was all maintained. specifically, if this channel was an "official" support channel, so forth.
2009-09-07T04:25:00.000Z	sebsebseb	stickapotomus	yes it is an offical channal, but most people here  aren't  exactly linked to  Canaonical the company behind Ubuntu,  and most don't have the Ubuntu member status thingey
2009-09-07T04:25:00.000Z	stickapotomus	sebsebseb	i see. so this is mostly a user helping user channel, yes?
2009-09-07T04:26:00.000Z	sebsebseb	stickapotomus	yes volunters from all over the world, helping other people
2009-09-07T04:26:00.000Z	sebsebseb	stickapotomus	or  users asking for help with their Ubuntu
2009-09-07T04:27:00.000Z	sebsebseb	stickapotomus	well  I guess at least someone from every Internet connected countrey/island comes in here, but  you get the idea,   The Internet yeah
2009-09-07T04:27:00.000Z	stickapotomus	sebsebseb	Canaonical then doesn't offer a support service, like say you would call into Dell for help, etc. Correct?
2009-09-07T04:27:00.000Z	sebsebseb	stickapotomus	pici is an op/admin of the channal by the way
2009-09-07T04:28:00.000Z	sebsebseb	stickapotomus	they do offer commercial suppourt as well, but yes it's better to take this discussion to #ubuntu-offtopic
2009-09-07T04:29:00.000Z	stickapotomus	sebsebseb	k, no more questions about support then - rather the actual question. has anyone ever had problems with the network applet in 9.04 of ubuntu showing the wireless network disconnected, but when you right click and view connection information it shows that is in fact, connected?
2009-09-07T04:31:00.000Z	sebsebseb	stickapotomus	I  think I read before that, that applet can be a bit  misleading (I think that's the word I want)
2009-09-07T04:32:00.000Z	stickapotomus	sebsebseb	well, in that senario; my wireless network appears to be offline, since I can't ping out anywhere. BUT - i am running dual wireless network cards. at any rate, I got fed up and installed wicd - which now allows me to connect and stay connected to my wireless network. should i file bug report then for the network applet?
2009-09-07T04:33:00.000Z	sebsebseb	stickapotomus	Wireless is not my area
