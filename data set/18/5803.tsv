2009-08-27T05:57:00.000Z	maco	mralexandro	emerald is not really recommended....upstream's ignoring it in hopes of it going away
2009-08-27T05:57:00.000Z	maco	mralexandro	the default window decorator for compiz, gtk-window-decorator, is more stable
2009-08-27T05:57:00.000Z	mralexandro	maco	 alright, so i should rather use gtk themes then?
2009-08-27T05:58:00.000Z	mralexandro	maco	is there a configurator for those themes except the normal appearence tab?
2009-08-27T05:58:00.000Z	maco	mralexandro	compiz can use metacity themes just fine. and itll probably insert semi-transparency automatically
2009-08-27T05:59:00.000Z	maco	mralexandro	that's the only way i know besides editing the theme yourself... but i dont use a normal window manager, so i dont know if a tool for creating metacity themes has been created
2009-08-27T05:59:00.000Z	mralexandro	maco	what window manager do you use ?
2009-08-27T05:59:00.000Z	maco	mralexandro	xmonad
2009-08-27T06:00:00.000Z	mralexandro	maco	and that is more stable than metacity and emerald?
2009-08-27T06:00:00.000Z	maco	mralexandro	its a completely different workflow
2009-08-27T06:00:00.000Z	maco	mralexandro	also, emerald is not a window manager
2009-08-27T06:01:00.000Z	maco	mralexandro	emerald and gtk-window-decorator are two window decorators for compiz. they draw the colored border and titlebar on windows when you use compiz.
2009-08-27T06:01:00.000Z	mralexandro	maco	 sorry i mixed, metacity and compiz is window managers, gtk and emerald is decors
2009-08-27T06:01:00.000Z	maco	mralexandro	well "gtk" on its own refers to the widget toolkit. thats why i keep saying the whole g-w-d version
2009-08-27T06:02:00.000Z	mralexandro	maco	understood:)
2009-08-27T06:02:00.000Z	maco	mralexandro	xmonad is a tiling window manager. it suits my workflow (all windows either take the whole screen or they squish right up against each other in columns) better. it also doesnt have titlebars
