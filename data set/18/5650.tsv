2009-12-05T21:49:00.000Z	tapas		is there a thunderbird 3 package available in ubuntu?
2009-12-05T21:49:00.000Z	tapas		apt-get install thunderbird-3.0 complains about "no installation candidate available"
2009-12-05T21:51:00.000Z	tapas		not 3.x
2009-12-05T21:52:00.000Z	tapas		[thinking a bit into the future :)]
2009-12-05T21:53:00.000Z	tapas		well, the reason for me asking about a newer thunderbird is this:
2009-12-05T21:53:00.000Z	tapas		http://tapas.affenbande.org/thunderbird_scrollbar.png
2009-12-05T21:54:00.000Z	tapas		thunderbird in ubuntu doesn't show the scrollbar in the message view when not vertically maximized
2009-12-05T21:54:00.000Z	tapas		so it's basically unnavigatable
2009-12-05T21:55:00.000Z	armornick	tapas	you seem to be using awesome, so don't you have a fullscreen mode?
2009-12-05T21:56:00.000Z	tapas	armornick	it's xmonad.. and yes, of course i can maximize thunderbird
2009-12-05T21:56:00.000Z	tapas	armornick	but since every other app, even firefox works well, when not maximized i suspect a thunderbird bug
2009-12-05T21:56:00.000Z	armornick	tapas	oh, okay
2009-12-05T21:56:00.000Z	tapas	armornick	you see how firefox for example shows its scrollbar ok?
2009-12-05T21:56:00.000Z	tapas		as opposed to thunderbird's message view
2009-12-05T21:57:00.000Z	armornick	tapas	like they said, try the latest build from the site
2009-12-05T21:57:00.000Z	tapas	armornick	will do.,. i hope this doesn't trash my folders in any way :(
2009-12-05T21:58:00.000Z	armornick	tapas	back up .thunderbird first then
2009-12-05T21:58:00.000Z	tapas	armornick	if that's all that's needed. great :)
