2005-01-05T14:24:00.000Z	thoreauputic	briansanders4	I had problems with CDRW when I changed from 2.4 to 2.6 - I needed to edit /etc/fstab as well as specifying /dev/hdc in k3b
2005-01-05T14:25:00.000Z	thoreauputic	briansanders4	possibly the symlink for /dev/cdrom points to the wrong place
2005-01-05T14:33:00.000Z	thoreauputic	briansanders4	does google turn up any problems like yours with linux?
2005-01-05T15:06:00.000Z	thoreauputic	briansanders4	you can't mount that hard drive manually?
2005-01-05T15:07:00.000Z	thoreauputic	briansanders4	probably just an /etc/fstab edit will fix it
2005-01-05T15:26:00.000Z	thoreauputic	briansanders4	does hdb1 have an /etc/fstab entry? If so, what does it say?
2005-01-05T15:28:00.000Z	thoreauputic	briansanders4	and a cd to /mnt/share followed by an ls -al shows nothing?
2005-01-05T15:28:00.000Z	briansanders4	thoreauputic	correct
