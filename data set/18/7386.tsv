2008-01-19T07:27:00.000Z	ApacheNoob		!server
2008-01-19T07:27:00.000Z	ApacheNoob		:P
2008-01-19T07:28:00.000Z	ApacheNoob		I need to set up an ftp and http server as well as a quake server on this computer
2008-01-19T07:28:00.000Z	Elevator_Hazard	ApacheNoob	Try LAMPP? Its not a quake server, but its all the others you wanted bundled into one package.
2008-01-19T07:29:00.000Z	Elevator_Hazard	ApacheNoob	I know it has apache and php and ftp.
2008-01-19T07:29:00.000Z	Elevator_Hazard	ApacheNoob	I don't think so.
2008-01-19T07:29:00.000Z	Elevator_Hazard	ApacheNoob	That's not the ftp server though.
2008-01-19T07:29:00.000Z	Elevator_Hazard	ApacheNoob	and I dont' think its got php with it either.
2008-01-19T07:30:00.000Z	Elevator_Hazard	ApacheNoob	I'm looking for it now in Add/Remove
2008-01-19T07:31:00.000Z	Elevator_Hazard	ApacheNoob	That's not lampp but I guess I'd go with that.
2008-01-19T07:32:00.000Z	Elevator_Hazard	ApacheNoob	Nickrud had a better idea.
2008-01-19T07:34:00.000Z	Elevator_Hazard	ApacheNoob	Maybe nickrud misspelled one..?
2008-01-19T07:36:00.000Z	Elevator_Hazard	ApacheNoob	Based on preference I suppose, I've not messed around with ftp servers much.
2008-01-19T07:36:00.000Z	Elevator_Hazard	ApacheNoob	Yea I used proftpd but that's only because it came with lampp
2008-01-19T07:41:00.000Z	Elevator_Hazard	ApacheNoob	Could use a GUI or command line... One second
2008-01-19T07:43:00.000Z	Elevator_Hazard	ApacheNoob	Does this help? http://www.netadmintools.com/art355.html
2008-01-19T07:44:00.000Z	Elevator_Hazard	ApacheNoob	mhm
