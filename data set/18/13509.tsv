2005-11-21T12:57:00.000Z	Red-Sox	trappist	so you know what I need to do, not how to do it, just what i need to do to fix it?
2005-11-21T12:58:00.000Z	trappist	Red-Sox	I know that you need a sound daemon and that gnome's sound daemon is esd, but I don't use gnome
2005-11-21T13:01:00.000Z	Red-Sox	trappist	if you want to, but ONLY if you want to, you could please tell me what a sound daemon is
2005-11-21T13:02:00.000Z	trappist	Red-Sox	it mixes sounds so separate apps can produce sounds at the same time.  decent sound cards do this for you in the hardware, but if you don't have one of those you need software like esd to emulate it.
2005-11-21T13:03:00.000Z	Red-Sox	trappist	my gaming computer has a good sound card, but i too scared to dual boot that expensive machine
2005-11-21T13:09:00.000Z	Red-Sox	trappist	, aet: thank you soooooooooooooo much
2005-11-22T15:42:00.000Z	trappist	Red-Sox	or get a card that does hardware mixing
2005-12-11T16:17:00.000Z	Red-Sox	trappist	why do you say it would be better if nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn changed his nick?
2005-12-11T16:17:00.000Z	trappist	Red-Sox	because it's extraordinarily lame?
