2011-12-20T23:13:00.000Z	abu-bakr		quick one guys .. where can i find my ssh key?
2011-12-20T23:13:00.000Z	ssta	abu-bakr	probably ~/.ssh
2011-12-20T23:13:00.000Z	ssta		that's the server key
2011-12-20T23:14:00.000Z	abu-bakr		ok lemme see
2011-12-20T23:14:00.000Z	ssta		if you generate a personal key it goes into ~/.ssh (by default)
2011-12-20T23:14:00.000Z	ssta	abu-bakr	what do you need it for exactly?
2011-12-20T23:14:00.000Z	abu-bakr		rsync
2011-12-20T23:14:00.000Z	ssta	abu-bakr	did you generate one with ssh-keygen?
2011-12-20T23:14:00.000Z	abu-bakr		to access remote machine to back its directories up
2011-12-20T23:15:00.000Z	abu-bakr		erm.. no
2011-12-20T23:15:00.000Z	ssta	abu-bakr	well, that's probably the first step then
2011-12-20T23:15:00.000Z	abu-bakr	ssta	cool
2011-12-20T23:16:00.000Z	abu-bakr		i have a guide on this but i dont get how the public key gets transferred to the server?
2011-12-20T23:16:00.000Z	ssta	abu-bakr	might like to read: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/Keys
2011-12-20T23:16:00.000Z	ssta	abu-bakr	you have to put it there (or give it to whoever runs the server to put there for you)
2011-12-20T23:16:00.000Z	abu-bakr		oic
2011-12-20T23:17:00.000Z	abu-bakr	ssta	thanks ...
2011-12-20T23:17:00.000Z	ssta	abu-bakr	the key is in two halves...a public half and a private half.  You keep the private half, and put the public half on the server
