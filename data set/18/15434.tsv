2005-12-16T08:25:00.000Z	oggah		Hello, I got a quite big problem. I installed Ubuntu Hoary yesterday on my laptop. Dual-boot with winxp. (on same Harddrive). I created a partition, 4Gb with ubuntu on. And another, 1Gb as a swap. The rest of the harddrive is dedicated to winxp. (ntfs). I would like to remove ubuntu completley.
