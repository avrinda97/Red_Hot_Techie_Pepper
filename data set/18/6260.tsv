2008-11-23T01:57:00.000Z	goat|lappy	matchez	why are you building g++, did you attempt to apt-get install build-essential?
2008-11-23T01:58:00.000Z	goat|lappy	matchez	oh, and then apt-get install g++ ?
2008-11-23T01:58:00.000Z	goat|lappy	matchez	thats wehre you get the error?
2008-11-23T02:00:00.000Z	goat|lappy	matchez	i wasn't aware of a known bug, read fde's comment
2008-11-23T02:01:00.000Z	goat|lappy	matchez	yes, that is what fde is saying...
2008-11-23T02:02:00.000Z	goat|lappy	matchez	you can also sudo apt-get update,  just to be safe
