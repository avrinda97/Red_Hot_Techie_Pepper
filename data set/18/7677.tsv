2008-02-20T23:22:00.000Z	k4k		anyone know what this means, I get it when I type mount
2008-02-20T23:22:00.000Z	k4k		/dev/sda2 on / type ext3 (rw,errors=remount-ro
2008-02-20T23:23:00.000Z	aoupi	k4k	it means the second partition of the device /dev/sda (/dev/sda2) is mounted on / (your root), it's mounted readwrite and in case of error it should be remounted read only
2008-02-20T23:24:00.000Z	aoupi	k4k	you can see 'man mount' for more mount options
2008-02-20T23:24:00.000Z	k4k	aoupi	ok, so I can't write anything to /var which is part of /, does that mean I have to reboot?
2008-02-20T23:25:00.000Z	aoupi	k4k	no, I think that is not related
2008-02-20T23:25:00.000Z	aoupi	k4k	if your root partition had been remounted readonly you'd have noticed it
2008-02-20T23:26:00.000Z	k4k	aoupi	I think I did, my computer locked up for about 3 minutes with a lot of hard drive activity
2008-02-20T23:26:00.000Z	aoupi	k4k	only root can write to /var
2008-02-20T23:26:00.000Z	k4k	aoupi	I'm root when I try to do things
2008-02-20T23:26:00.000Z	aoupi	k4k	if your root had been remounted readonly you wouldn't be able to write anywhere
2008-02-20T23:26:00.000Z	aoupi	k4k	(except on separate mountpoints of course)
2008-02-20T23:27:00.000Z	k4k	aoupi	ok that answer my question, I'll reboot to see if that fixes it
2008-02-20T23:27:00.000Z	aoupi	k4k	if your drive made weird noices you should probably run fsck on it
2008-02-20T23:27:00.000Z	k4k	aoupi	my hard drive always makes weird noises, it's 10 years old
2008-02-20T23:28:00.000Z	aoupi	k4k	hah, good thing you don't have anything important on it  :)
2008-02-20T23:29:00.000Z	k4k	aoupi	JBD: Failed to read block at offset 4419
