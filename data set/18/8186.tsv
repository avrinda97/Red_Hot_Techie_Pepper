2007-09-27T14:17:00.000Z	Bannerman		My computer time is like 30 seconds slow in 10 minutes. Is there something I can do to fix that?
2007-09-27T14:17:00.000Z	neverblue2	Bannerman	sync the time with a remote location?
2007-09-27T14:17:00.000Z	Bannerman	neverblue2	yeah, but I can't sync every minute
2007-09-27T14:17:00.000Z	Bannerman	neverblue2	30 seconds in 10 minutes is ridiculous
2007-09-27T14:18:00.000Z	Bannerman	neverblue2	there's got to be a way to make it more accurate
2007-09-27T14:18:00.000Z	neverblue2	Bannerman	I just told you :)
2007-09-27T14:18:00.000Z	Bannerman	neverblue2	that doesn't make it more accurate. that just sets it once in awhile.
2007-09-27T14:18:00.000Z	Bannerman	neverblue2	if I want to keep it accurate within a minute I would literally have to set the time every 5-10 minutes.
2007-09-27T14:19:00.000Z	neverblue2	Bannerman	how is the internal clock holding up?
2007-09-27T14:19:00.000Z	neverblue2	Bannerman	are you possibly overclocking?
2007-09-27T14:19:00.000Z	Bannerman	neverblue2	apparently it's holding up poorly?
2007-09-27T14:19:00.000Z	Bannerman	neverblue2	no, no overclocking.
2007-09-27T14:20:00.000Z	neverblue2	Bannerman	so you dont know if the system clock is off then ?
2007-09-27T14:21:00.000Z	Bannerman	neverblue2	I assumed my system clock was using my internal clock. How do I check internal clock time?
2007-09-27T14:25:00.000Z	neverblue2	Bannerman	not really sure on that, maybe hit up the 'gO_Ogle'
2007-09-27T14:25:00.000Z	Bannerman	neverblue2	uh... been there.
2007-09-27T14:26:00.000Z	Bannerman	neverblue2	"date".
2007-09-27T14:29:00.000Z	Bannerman	neverblue2	well thanks for trying
