2010-02-01T09:23:00.000Z	k_		i modified the grub2 file but still can't get rid of the menu with kernel options can someone help me?
2010-02-01T09:23:00.000Z	TLUL	k_	what do you want to get rid of? The OS select screen?
2010-02-01T09:23:00.000Z	k_		yes
2010-02-01T09:23:00.000Z	k_		i set timeout at 0
2010-02-01T09:23:00.000Z	TLUL	k_	Okay, I was reading about how to do this just a few days ago.
2010-02-01T09:24:00.000Z	TLUL	k_	I'll check. I know there's a fairly simple way to do it...
2010-02-01T09:24:00.000Z	k_		thanks
2010-02-01T09:29:00.000Z	TLUL	k_	I think I know how to do it.
2010-02-01T09:30:00.000Z	k_	TLUL	how?
2010-02-01T09:30:00.000Z	TLUL	k_	If you open up the terminal and type "sudo gedit /etc/default/grub" then you should see the grub configuration file
2010-02-01T09:31:00.000Z	TLUL		In there, remove the # before the part that says "GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0"
2010-02-01T09:31:00.000Z	k_		ah
2010-02-01T09:31:00.000Z	TLUL	k_	Then, once that's removed, you'll need to update the complete settings file.
2010-02-01T09:32:00.000Z	TLUL	k_	Typing "sudo update-grub" should do it.
2010-02-01T09:32:00.000Z	k_	TLUL	i already did that :/
2010-02-01T09:32:00.000Z	k_	TLUL	did not help
2010-02-01T09:33:00.000Z	TLUL	k_	You already uncommented GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0 and ran update-grub?
2010-02-01T09:33:00.000Z	TLUL	k_	And the timeout is still there? Hmm...
