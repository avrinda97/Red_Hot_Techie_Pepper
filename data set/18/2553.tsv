2010-10-09T19:43:00.000Z	cage_raphel	Gigacore	the most common issue being.. once  my machine boots.. it takes me to a black screen.. with a blinking cursor.. and then it gives a error message ( which i have not made a note of ) and the caps lock and the scroll lock lights on my keyboard starts flashing.. and my system becomes unresponsive.
2010-10-09T19:45:00.000Z	Gigacore	cage_raphel	do you get the list of earlier version of kernels at grub boot menu?
2010-10-09T19:46:00.000Z	cage_raphel	Gigacore	how do i identify the list of earlier version of kernels  in my boot menu?
2010-10-09T19:47:00.000Z	Gigacore	cage_raphel	after updating, the newest version of kernel will be on the top.. and the older version will go to the bottom..
2010-10-09T19:47:00.000Z	cage_raphel	Gigacore	are u reffering to the grub menu which i get at boot up?
2010-10-09T19:47:00.000Z	Gigacore	cage_raphel	so try if you can boot in properly with older version of kernel
2010-10-09T19:47:00.000Z	Gigacore	cage_raphel	yes
2010-10-09T19:48:00.000Z	Gigacore	cage_raphel	older version of kernel.. that worked properly..
2010-10-09T19:48:00.000Z	Gigacore	cage_raphel	if you don't remember the version, just boot into the oldest available kernel in the grub boot menu
2010-10-09T19:50:00.000Z	cage_raphel	Gigacore	how do i identify the oldest available kernel in the boot menu? i know u will feel like killing me for my most stupid questions on earth.. i am really sorry bro. but i really appreciate  you helping me to get this fixed.
