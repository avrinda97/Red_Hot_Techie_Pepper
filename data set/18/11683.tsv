2006-06-24T11:00:00.000Z	rawr1		omg this is the second time this has happened to me ... i did a net install of the dapper i386 iso and for the second time, AFTER downloading and installation the screen HANGS. it's a black screen with what looks like to be two small white blocks on either side of the screen against a black background
2006-06-24T11:01:00.000Z	rawr1		and what's worse is that it leaves 0 partitions active after it!! now i'm in knoppix and i used qtparted to set hda2 back to active
2006-06-24T11:01:00.000Z	rawr1		does anyone know how to resolve this problem?
2006-06-24T11:02:00.000Z	rawr1		LOL
2006-06-24T11:02:00.000Z	rawr1		that's exactly what it looks like! seriously, without the ball of course
2006-06-24T11:02:00.000Z	rawr1		you remember the ping pong game on those old consoles? atari i think?
2006-06-24T11:04:00.000Z	rawr1		ok no one knows, i'll try a different problem then that's been bothering me... 2) i downloaded the dapper i386 iso, and i burnt it and boot it up with the "start and install" but it takes FOREVER to load (this is a 2.8ghz pc so..). What's worse is that it takes 3 minutes and 42 seconds (i timed it) to open up the installer in ubuntu! and it's even SLOWER to install it (i have yet to get past the "select timezone" part)
2006-06-24T11:05:00.000Z	rawr1		no one?
2006-06-24T11:07:00.000Z	rawr1		why does it take forever to open up the dapper live cd and install? i can't even get past the installation part because it's SOO SLOW and it's not my processor
2006-06-24T11:07:00.000Z	adamant1988	rawr1	 I had a similiar issue, but I found that burning a more up to date iso helped things :)
2006-06-24T11:08:00.000Z	rawr1	adamant1988	really? i have the desktop dapper 6.06 iso, is there a newer one than that?
2006-06-24T11:09:00.000Z	adamant1988	rawr1	 patches get release etc. I *think* they include patches in the isos, but I'm not sure.  I know that re-burning helped though
2006-06-24T11:09:00.000Z	rawr1	adamant1988	so reburn the patches to a new cd with the new iso?
2006-06-24T11:10:00.000Z	rawr1	adamant1988	alright i will, but SUPPOSE that doesn't work, what do i do? :)
2006-06-24T11:11:00.000Z	rawr1	adamant1988	 so new cd, just a regular 6.06 dapper build right? not a nightly one or something?
2006-06-24T11:12:00.000Z	adamant1988	rawr1	yeah just download the iso from the servers
2006-06-24T11:13:00.000Z	rawr1	adamant1988	ok one Last question LOL :) which one do you have? the desktop version or hte server?
2006-06-24T11:13:00.000Z	adamant1988	rawr1	I'm using the Dapper desktop 6.06
