2006-09-11T12:48:00.000Z	jennyli		hi
2006-09-11T12:48:00.000Z	jennyli		is this for linux support?
2006-09-11T12:48:00.000Z	jennyli		yeah i just got that
2006-09-11T12:49:00.000Z	jennyli		my friend gave me this dvd of it and said it was better than windows
2006-09-11T12:49:00.000Z	sp0rk	jennyli	what do you usually do with computers?
2006-09-11T12:49:00.000Z	sp0rk	jennyli	if you play games, ubuntu is NOT better than windows.
2006-09-11T12:50:00.000Z	sp0rk	jennyli	then it is better than windows. haha.
2006-09-11T12:53:00.000Z	sp0rk	jennyli	you booted the live CD, so you've got basically a working ubuntu system running *off the CD*, but not installed on your harddrive
2006-09-11T12:54:00.000Z	sp0rk	jennyli	what's the error *exactly*
2006-09-11T12:55:00.000Z	sp0rk	jennyli	i gotta say, your friend's kinda lame for not helping you install ubuntu haha, let me get you a link on how to install it
2006-09-11T12:56:00.000Z	sp0rk	jennyli	psh, what a newb.
2006-09-11T12:56:00.000Z	sp0rk	jennyli	you seem pretty intelligent sofar, so you should be able to get it installed on your own if you read what i'm about to get you
2006-09-11T12:57:00.000Z	sp0rk	jennyli	https://help.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/desktopguide/C/index.html
2006-09-11T12:57:00.000Z	sp0rk	jennyli	for getting windows working along side ubuntu: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WindowsDualBootHowTo
2006-09-11T13:03:00.000Z	sp0rk	jennyli	i would suggest just installing it fresh following the instructions on this link..
2006-09-11T13:04:00.000Z	sp0rk	jennyli	plus, installing using those instructions will help you really understand ubuntu better
2006-09-11T13:08:00.000Z	sp0rk	jennyli	yeah, that way we can see it without the channel being flooded
