2009-06-02T09:29:00.000Z	BigPatice		hey anybody know about changing a single sudo command to run without a password
2009-06-02T09:29:00.000Z	Flannel	BigPatice	Its doable.  What are you trying to run without a password?
2009-06-02T09:32:00.000Z	BigPatice	Flannel	i have tried editing the sudoers file but it seems to open up all sudo commands
2009-06-02T09:34:00.000Z	Flannel	BigPatice	Do you want anyone to be able to do it? or just people who can sudo anyway?
2009-06-02T09:34:00.000Z	BigPatice	Flannel	just me in a script. only this command and only  me
2009-06-02T09:35:00.000Z	Flannel	BigPatice	username ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/apt-get update
2009-06-02T09:36:00.000Z	Flannel	BigPatice	Where username is your username.  (And of course, rememebr to use visudo)
2009-06-02T09:36:00.000Z	BigPatice	Flannel	i did that but after i edited that all sudo commands ran without a password
2009-06-02T09:36:00.000Z	Flannel	BigPatice	What line did you put?
2009-06-02T09:37:00.000Z	BigPatice	Flannel	what do you mean? i tried that earlier
2009-06-02T09:37:00.000Z	Flannel	BigPatice	What was the line you added?
2009-06-02T09:38:00.000Z	BigPatice	Flannel	do you mean like command aliases?
2009-06-02T09:38:00.000Z	Flannel	BigPatice	I mean what did you add to your sudoers?
2009-06-02T09:39:00.000Z	BigPatice	Flannel	myname ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/apt-get
2009-06-02T09:40:00.000Z	Flannel	BigPatice	And visudo let you save that?
2009-06-02T09:40:00.000Z	BigPatice	Flannel	yes was that wrong?
2009-06-02T09:41:00.000Z	Flannel	BigPatice	also, you want /usr/bin/apt-get update, not just apt-get
2009-06-02T09:43:00.000Z	BigPatice	Flannel	thanks dude
