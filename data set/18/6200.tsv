2009-06-20T21:16:00.000Z	zaccour		i know when i reinstall Ubuntu i'm unbanned from chats i was banned at before, just wanna know if there is a faster way, like an application of some sort
2009-06-20T21:16:00.000Z	keith-	zaccour	there are about 3 ways
2009-06-20T21:16:00.000Z	keith-	zaccour	the first is if you are on a router then you login to the router and release your IP and renew it. that'll probably change it.
2009-06-20T21:17:00.000Z	keith-	zaccour	the second is to ifdown wlan0 or whatever your adapter name is and ifup it after that.
2009-06-20T21:17:00.000Z	keith-	zaccour	the last is not to be a dumbass and get banned.
2009-06-20T21:17:00.000Z	keith-	zaccour	they are just going to ban you again when they realize it is you.
2009-06-20T21:18:00.000Z	zaccour	keith-	i don't know what you mean. do those commands change it?
2009-06-20T21:19:00.000Z	keith-	zaccour	just stop getting yourself banned. are you wired straight to your modem or are you on a router/
2009-06-20T21:19:00.000Z	zaccour	keith-	wired router
2009-06-20T21:20:00.000Z	keith-	zaccour	those aren't the same thing. is it a modem/router combo like the one at&t has now?
2009-06-20T21:20:00.000Z	zaccour	keith-	no but the same i.p.
2009-06-20T21:21:00.000Z	keith-	zaccour	unplug your damned modem for about 10 minutes... someone else will probably pull your IP from you after ten minutes. plug your modem back in.
2009-06-20T21:21:00.000Z	keith-	zaccour	there is no reason reinstalling ubuntu would change that. so either they are unbanning you in the 15 minutes it takes to reinstall ubuntu or there is something else you are doing tooo
2009-06-20T21:22:00.000Z	keith-	zaccour	might i suggest one more time that you not be an idiot and get yourself banned. perhaps if they keep banning you and you feel it is wrong then this isn't the best chatroom to hang out in
2009-06-20T21:23:00.000Z	zaccour	keith-	just asking a question, no reason to be a smartass
2009-06-20T21:23:00.000Z	keith-	zaccour	i was just being honest. not a smartass.
2009-06-20T21:24:00.000Z	zaccour	keith-	oh ok
2009-06-20T21:30:00.000Z	keith-	zaccour	just reinstall ubuntu. stop asking us how to get unbanned from a chatroom. or learn to use tor if it means that much to you
