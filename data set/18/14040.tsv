2005-09-27T15:14:00.000Z	Toba|BSD		hehe yeah
2005-09-27T15:15:00.000Z	Toba|BSD		I think this is a serious issue myself
2005-09-27T15:15:00.000Z	Toba|BSD		when I click default I expect it to be default
2005-09-27T15:15:00.000Z	Toba|BSD		heh
2005-09-27T15:15:00.000Z	ompaul	Toba|BSD	for values of $default
2005-09-27T15:21:00.000Z	ompaul	Toba|BSD	it should be good to go, the bottom line is [as someone told me last week {wink at Seveas}]  if you install it on ubuntu/debian it works - you installed it because you wanted it didn't you :) some exceptions - asterisk but thats a different story
2006-01-07T16:10:00.000Z	ompaul	Toba|BSD	what is not happening for you?
2006-01-07T16:11:00.000Z	Toba|BSD	ompaul	nothing, it mounts ok
2006-01-07T16:11:00.000Z	ompaul	Toba|BSD	so why the question, and have you removed the second ide harddrive?
2006-01-07T16:11:00.000Z	Toba|BSD	ompaul	yes, /dev/hdb1 is no longer there
2006-01-07T16:13:00.000Z	ompaul	Toba|BSD	I see no
2006-01-07T16:13:00.000Z	ompaul	Toba|BSD	the clue is in my /home :) read this and see if you get it in a min if not ask >>>/dev/hda10      /home           ext3    defaults        0       2<< and it is not the 2
2006-01-07T16:21:00.000Z	Toba|BSD	ompaul	could you look at http://toba.ath.cx:724/~eastein/fstab.txt and http://toba.ath.cx:724/~eastein/mountfail.jpg?
2006-01-07T16:24:00.000Z	ompaul	Toba|BSD	what are you actually running because the sda to me should only pop into existance with hotplug in my mind
2006-01-07T16:27:00.000Z	Toba|BSD	ompaul	yeah, somebody else already pointed out that /dev/sda should not be in my fstab
2006-01-07T16:27:00.000Z	ompaul	Toba|BSD	the question was what are you running?
2006-01-07T16:29:00.000Z	Toba|BSD	ompaul	ubuntu 5.10
2006-01-07T16:32:00.000Z	ompaul	Toba|BSD	well you could try it with that hashed out and see if it is available
