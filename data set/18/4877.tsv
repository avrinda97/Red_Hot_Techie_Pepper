2009-01-22T23:05:00.000Z	Javache		hi guys, i'm considering switching to ubuntu, so I'd like to split my disk, what tool do you recommend to resize partitions?
2009-01-22T23:05:00.000Z	Javache		also will the ubuntu installer just use the empty space on my drive?
2009-01-22T23:05:00.000Z	Javache		i mean the unpartitioned space
2009-01-22T23:06:00.000Z	Javache		nice, thanks for the info jim_p
2009-01-22T23:07:00.000Z	Javache		thing is I don't know a lot about the different file system types and how I should set it up, any links for that?
2009-01-22T23:07:00.000Z	Javache		and mgolisch, I'm always backed up ;-)

2009-01-23T19:16:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Javache	Please post a description of the problem along with your link
2009-01-23T19:16:00.000Z	Javache	Jack_Sparrow	problem was posted couple of minutes ago, parted says "can't have partition outside the disk"
2009-01-23T19:19:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Javache	your size is over the size of the drive by 2
2009-01-23T19:19:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Javache	255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 18241 cylinders  and  you are trying  /dev/sdb1   *           1       18242
2009-01-23T19:19:00.000Z	Javache	Jack_Sparrow	is that the number of blocks you are talking about? how could i fix it
2009-01-23T19:20:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Javache	gparted
2009-01-23T19:39:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Javache	nope
2009-01-23T19:40:00.000Z	Javache	Jack_Sparrow	great :-) is there a way to do it safely then?
2009-01-23T19:40:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Javache	try resizing it down
2009-01-23T19:40:00.000Z	Javache	Jack_Sparrow	with what? parted doesn't recognize any partition
2009-01-23T19:41:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Javache	since this isnt a   ubuntu support issue you will need to find some tools that can do it.. there is nothing we have other than basic editor
