2008-04-05T11:45:00.000Z	xtknight	wers	 excuse me.  the fish is still on my screen too lol
2008-04-05T11:45:00.000Z	wers	xtknight	see??
2008-04-05T11:46:00.000Z	xtknight	wers	you can try restarting gnome-panel but i dont know if that will kill your documents
2008-04-05T11:46:00.000Z	wers	xtknight	it won't i think
2008-04-05T11:47:00.000Z	xtknight	wers	ya i just did it " killall gnome-panel && gnome-panel ".  cant confirm if fish is gone yet
2008-04-05T11:47:00.000Z	xtknight	wers	well i haven't seen it
2008-04-05T11:47:00.000Z	xtknight	wers	i got that tip from a page.. it's a gnome easter egg
2008-04-05T11:48:00.000Z	xtknight	wers	yea
2008-04-05T11:48:00.000Z	wers	xtknight	yeah. 'cause run dialog is a part of gnome panel
2008-07-05T11:58:00.000Z	xtknight	wers	type chmod +x ./file.run  , and then ./file.run
2008-07-05T11:58:00.000Z	xtknight	wers	this gives you executable permissions for the file
2008-07-05T11:59:00.000Z	xtknight	wers	not every user can execute certain files, it is a security thing
2008-07-05T12:08:00.000Z	xtknight	wers	you have to mount hda1 to a directory,. and then point it to the directory to which you mounted hda1
