2008-03-03T20:26:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Soulsublime	Please provide description as well as a linkl
2008-03-03T20:28:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Soulsublime	at start or install  hit F6   then try a few command line modifiers...  like noapic  acpi=off  before the --   and remove splash and quiet from the boot line.
2008-03-03T20:29:00.000Z	Soulsublime	Jack_Sparrow	I've tried noapic and nolapic as well as acpi=off, and it didnt help
2008-03-03T20:30:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Soulsublime	noapic acpi=off, pci=irqroute, xmodule=vesa, vga=normal, vga=771, vga=791, pci=irqroute, framebuffer=false, ide=nodma, nomce, pnpbios=off, xdrvr=vesa, res=800x600, apm=off,pci=noapci, nolapic, all_generic_ide, nolapic, pci=assign-busses, pci=irqpoll, pci=biosirq, pnpbios=off, hpet=disable   are several options that I have seen used
2008-03-03T20:30:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Soulsublime	HAve you tried the alternate text cd
2008-03-03T20:31:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Soulsublime	I suggest you provide more info on your hardware....
2008-03-03T20:32:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Soulsublime	mostly motherboard and video...  info on any non standard keyboards or mice like bluetooth etc
2008-03-03T20:33:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Soulsublime	how much ram
2008-03-03T20:37:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Soulsublime	I am not a fan of msi, but nothing I see in there should be an issue
2008-03-03T20:39:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Soulsublime	THe livecd does not boot at all.. none of them.. 9 different distros?  NO odd keyboards, cards or bluetooth stuff
2008-03-03T20:39:00.000Z	Soulsublime	Jack_Sparrow	I've contacted them and they said that the MB should be working fine with linux
2008-03-03T20:41:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Soulsublime	Pardon my typos  ..:)
2008-03-03T20:42:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Soulsublime	I have no idea, I am sure I have installed on that hardware before..  or very close to it.  I would turn off the usb and power management in the bios and try it agin..  but that is just shooting in the dark
2008-03-03T20:54:00.000Z	Soulsublime	Jack_Sparrow	I'll try that out a bit later
2008-03-03T20:55:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Soulsublime	good luck..
