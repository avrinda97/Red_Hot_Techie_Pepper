2010-11-23T08:18:00.000Z	cbill		xplat_: what if you add .jar, will java open it?
2010-11-23T08:18:00.000Z	cbill		xplat_: i know very little with mac, so im only guessing lol
2010-11-23T08:19:00.000Z	Xplat_	cbill	at this rate, I'll try almost anything.
2010-11-23T08:22:00.000Z	Xplat_	cbill	then why is it saying it is a Java Class? That seems misleading.
2010-11-23T08:24:00.000Z	Xplat_	cbill	I'll tell you what it is: Xcode.
2010-11-23T08:26:00.000Z	Xplat_	cbill	yes. I am trying to do what linux users want to do with windows. I want to compile a mac program without a mac (I don't have one).
2010-11-23T08:28:00.000Z	Xplat_	cbill	that's okay. Who should I talk to?
2010-11-23T08:29:00.000Z	Xplat_	cbill	eclipse... I may have, but maybe I didn't use it right? I'll check again.
2010-11-23T08:29:00.000Z	Xplat_	cbill	will do.
2010-11-23T08:45:00.000Z	Xplat_	cbill	Eclipse doesn't have support for Xcode project bundles.
