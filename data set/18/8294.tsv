2007-12-20T02:33:00.000Z	ActySofts		if I turn it down, it goes back up
2007-12-20T02:33:00.000Z	ActySofts		if I try to unmute PCM, it stays muted
2007-12-20T02:35:00.000Z	ActySofts		yeah, it's getting better, still alpha though
2007-12-20T02:37:00.000Z	maddash	ActySofts	are you kiding?
2007-12-20T02:38:00.000Z	maddash	ActySofts	that was rhetorical. you obviously don't know what alsamixer does. :)
2007-12-20T02:38:00.000Z	ActySofts	maddash	I know exactly, I've used it lots of times before, now it just doesn't work at all ,how hard is it to understand?
2007-12-20T02:39:00.000Z	maddash	ActySofts	oh, sorry. you were describing your problem (I thought you were making an assertion)
2007-12-20T02:39:00.000Z	maddash	ActySofts	so the recording volume is too low?
2007-12-20T02:40:00.000Z	ActySofts	maddash	everything is at 100%, but PCM is muted, and everything is locked, I can't change the vol of ANYTHING and I can't mure/unmute anything
