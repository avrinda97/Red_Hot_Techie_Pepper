2010-01-31T13:19:00.000Z	TopGear		hello
2010-01-31T13:19:00.000Z	TopGear		can somebody help me
2010-01-31T13:20:00.000Z	TopGear		i've messed up my grub
2010-01-31T13:20:00.000Z	TopGear		well, can I ask it here?
2010-01-31T13:21:00.000Z	TopGear		it's grub 2
2010-01-31T13:21:00.000Z	tucemiux	TopGear	go ahead and ask, all in one line
2010-01-31T13:26:00.000Z	tucemiux	TopGear	do you have ubuntu installed on your machine?
2010-01-31T13:31:00.000Z	tucemiux	TopGear	you mean you boot up your machine and it takes 30 seconds for you to see the grub menu where you can choose what OS to boot up into?
2010-01-31T13:33:00.000Z	tucemiux	TopGear	so you added another hard drive and now grub is slow?
2010-01-31T13:34:00.000Z	tucemiux	TopGear	as Dr_Willis mentions, that can make grub slow
2010-01-31T13:34:00.000Z	tucemiux	TopGear	can you boot up to all of your OS's fine?
2010-01-31T13:35:00.000Z	tucemiux	TopGear	and it also seems to matter how you formatted the hard drive? I"ve never had any problems with ext3/ext4
2010-01-31T13:39:00.000Z	tucemiux	TopGear	you have to install grub in sda in the Master Boot Record
2010-01-31T13:40:00.000Z	tucemiux	TopGear	so you have ubuntu installed in sdd?
2010-01-31T13:41:00.000Z	tucemiux	TopGear	you have to reinstall grub, I suggest you go to #grub and ask them how to reinstall grub and show them your link to paste bin
2010-01-31T13:43:00.000Z	tucemiux	TopGear	if no one is in #grub right now try logging in to this channel at another time, you want to talk to someone who is familiar reinstalling grub
2010-01-31T13:44:00.000Z	tucemiux	TopGear	youre still there?  It doesnt seem difficult to reinstall grub
2010-01-31T13:46:00.000Z	tucemiux	TopGear	the trick here is to use the result you get from the find command: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=224351&highlight=reinstall+grub
