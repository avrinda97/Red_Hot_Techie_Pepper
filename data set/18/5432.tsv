2008-10-28T08:54:00.000Z	Spets	Randall	you have to crank it by hand
2008-10-28T08:54:00.000Z	Randall	Spets	probably
2008-10-28T08:54:00.000Z	Spets	Randall	on a serious note i believe the legacy driver will work
2008-10-28T08:55:00.000Z	Randall	Spets	can you explain how to me as well as if there is conflicting packages which i will need to uninstall
2008-10-28T08:56:00.000Z	Spets	Randall	depens on what you have installed. I think nvida-legacy will remove it for you
2008-10-28T08:56:00.000Z	Randall	Spets	what happens is that when i enable it from hardware drivers and restart it tells me i need to run ubuntu in low-graphics mode
2008-10-28T08:56:00.000Z	Randall	Spets	what command do i run i terminal to make sure i have nvidia-legacy installed
2008-10-28T08:56:00.000Z	Spets	Randall	were you expecting high-grapics perhaps?

2008-10-28T08:57:00.000Z	Randall	Spets	pretty much because that never came up even when i enabled it on 7.10
2008-10-28T08:57:00.000Z	Spets	Randall	and now you are using?
2008-10-28T08:58:00.000Z	Spets	Randall	i had some problems with MX 440 on 7.10 and earlier
2008-10-28T08:58:00.000Z	Randall	Spets	8.04, but my GRUB menu didn't update and i'm not sure if somewhere in the update process i need to specify it to update
2008-10-28T08:58:00.000Z	Randall	Spets	though i am sure i am on Hardy
2008-10-28T08:59:00.000Z	Spets		man irssi
2008-10-28T08:59:00.000Z	Randall	Spets	how would i check if i have my driver for it installed properly
