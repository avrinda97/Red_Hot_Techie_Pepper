2009-12-31T19:56:00.000Z	belak	FuneralChris	I havn't tried ubuntu...
2009-12-31T19:57:00.000Z	FuneralChris	belak	freezing screen is a grapihc card driver bug
2009-12-31T20:07:00.000Z	FuneralChris	belak	kde
2009-12-31T21:11:00.000Z	FuneralChris	belak	download latest drivers from nvidia.com, stop kdm and run file
2009-12-31T21:12:00.000Z	belak	FuneralChris	I was able to install the nvidia-glx-173 package... I just need to enable it
2009-12-31T21:13:00.000Z	FuneralChris	belak	this driver is too old, you can also install latest from repos. belak, i think ubuntu got a special thing calld "hardware drivers" (search in start menu), you can just click on "enable" in that tool
2009-12-31T21:13:00.000Z	belak	FuneralChris	I was trying that and it isn't doing anything.
2009-12-31T21:14:00.000Z	belak	FuneralChris	Why isn't it updated? It's been out for a while... and I think the newses nvidia-173 package (not in repos) is the only thing that works with xorg 1.7
2009-12-31T21:15:00.000Z	FuneralChris	belak	install this one, and reboot: http://packages.ubuntu.com/karmic/nvidia-glx-185
2009-12-31T21:15:00.000Z	belak	FuneralChris	My card doesn't work with the 185 branch
2009-12-31T21:15:00.000Z	FuneralChris	belak	xorg 1.7?
2009-12-31T21:15:00.000Z	FuneralChris	belak	oh
2009-12-31T21:16:00.000Z	FuneralChris	belak	did you reboot?
2009-12-31T21:16:00.000Z	FuneralChris	belak	rebooting is necessary i think
