2008-08-20T20:52:00.000Z	BeCreative		whats a good dvd player for ubuntu? cause totem aint working ...
2008-08-20T20:52:00.000Z	Fish-Face	BeCreative	I use xine
2008-08-20T20:53:00.000Z	Fish-Face	BeCreative	also consider googling on how to change/modify the totem backend
2008-08-20T20:53:00.000Z	Fish-Face	BeCreative	aye, what Odd-rationale said
2008-08-20T20:58:00.000Z	Fish-Face	BeCreative	have you tried xine/mplayer, and does it give any output?
2008-08-20T21:00:00.000Z	BeCreative	Fish-Face	just installed mplayer, no output
2008-08-20T21:01:00.000Z	Fish-Face	BeCreative	as in, no video? or no command-line output?
2008-08-20T21:01:00.000Z	Fish-Face	BeCreative	how are you starting mplayer/trying to play the video with mplayer?
2008-08-20T21:02:00.000Z	Fish-Face	BeCreative	sometimes the auto-ummount goes wonky
2008-08-20T21:02:00.000Z	Fish-Face	BeCreative	you can unmount the disk manually
2008-08-20T21:03:00.000Z	Fish-Face	BeCreative	:[
2008-08-20T21:03:00.000Z	Fish-Face	BeCreative	please don't give up, it works for me :/
2008-08-20T21:04:00.000Z	Fish-Face	BeCreative	true... I guess it depends how much you want ubuntu for other things
2008-08-20T21:07:00.000Z	Fish-Face	BeCreative	yeah, what Pici said. Unfortunately, DVDs are encrypted in a manner which prevents free software from legally playing them
2008-08-20T21:07:00.000Z	Fish-Face	BeCreative	so you have to install this package in order to crack the encryption on the disks
2008-08-20T21:08:00.000Z	Fish-Face	BeCreative	gnome-system-monitor can do it, or you can type "killall mplayer" at the command line
2008-08-20T21:20:00.000Z	Fish-Face	BeCreative	what's it doing at the moment?
2008-08-20T21:21:00.000Z	Fish-Face	BeCreative	0.0 how odd
