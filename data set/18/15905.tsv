2005-09-14T14:03:00.000Z	i3dmaster		anyone knows how to edit the right click menu?
2005-09-14T14:04:00.000Z	mcphail	i3dmaster	what do you want to add or change?
2005-09-14T14:05:00.000Z	i3dmaster	mcphail	I want to add a "open terminal" there on the right click menu. I am using breezy
2005-09-14T14:06:00.000Z	mcphail	i3dmaster	don't know how to do that directly, but you can add a simple script to do it to $HOME/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts and it will appear on the right-click menu
2005-09-14T14:07:00.000Z	i3dmaster	mcphail	ok, let me see...
2005-09-14T14:10:00.000Z	i3dmaster	mcphail	It didn't have anything in there yet.
2005-09-14T14:10:00.000Z	mcphail	i3dmaster	where?
2005-09-14T14:10:00.000Z	i3dmaster	mcphail	.gnome2/nautilus-scripts
2005-09-14T14:10:00.000Z	mcphail	i3dmaster	just add a script to the directory and chmod +x
2005-09-14T14:10:00.000Z	i3dmaster	mcphail	what would the script look like? just a shell script?
2005-09-14T14:11:00.000Z	i3dmaster	mcphail	something simply like gnome-terminal& right?
2005-09-14T14:11:00.000Z	mcphail	i3dmaster	yes: #! /bin/bash ; xterm ;exit 0 etc etc
2005-09-14T14:11:00.000Z	i3dmaster	mcphail	ok got it. Thanks very much! I will try it.
2005-09-14T14:12:00.000Z	mcphail	i3dmaster	this directory is very useful. I use it for lots of scripts (e.g. to resize jpegs from nautilus etc)
2005-09-14T14:18:00.000Z	i3dmaster	mcphail	got it. looks like it creates a sub menu on the right click menu and put scripts there. still not as easy as on the first level but much better than nothing.
2005-09-14T14:19:00.000Z	i3dmaster	mcphail	removing the "open terminal" is just not a good idea for gnome 2.12...
2005-09-14T14:19:00.000Z	mcphail	i3dmaster	sorry, best i could do ;)
2005-09-14T14:20:00.000Z	i3dmaster	mcphail	that's very good. I didn't even know how to do that before. So thanks very much
