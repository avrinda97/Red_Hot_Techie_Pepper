2004-12-09T08:15:00.000Z	grelli		and how is #ubuntu this -0700 evening?
2004-12-09T08:16:00.000Z	grelli		pro sco but not anti-linux
2004-12-09T08:16:00.000Z	grelli		I don't get it
2004-12-09T08:16:00.000Z	grelli		how does that work?
2004-12-09T08:16:00.000Z	grelli		and why?
2004-12-09T08:17:00.000Z	LinuxJones	grelli	probably a SCO lawyer looking to make a case for the entire world against their client :D
2004-12-09T08:17:00.000Z	grelli		hehe
2004-12-09T08:17:00.000Z	grelli		understandably
2004-12-09T08:18:00.000Z	grelli		they're going to get spanked by IBM at some point
2004-12-09T08:18:00.000Z	grelli		may as well line the next one up
2004-12-09T08:18:00.000Z	grelli	bob2	don't be so loud, you'll upset nick
2004-12-09T08:19:00.000Z	grelli		anywho
2004-12-09T08:19:00.000Z	LinuxJones	grelli	they have no case at all, not long ago Darl was saying that Linux had over a million lines of code that belonged to SCO. That has all gone away and now it is jsut a case of breach of contract or some garbage. I guess lying to the courts is not a crime in America ?
2004-12-09T08:19:00.000Z	grelli		I've noticed a rather odd behaviour lately
2004-12-09T08:20:00.000Z	grelli		if I select reboot or shutdown, upon re-logging in the X session dies
2004-12-09T08:20:00.000Z	grelli		the fix is to chown $USER ~/.ICEauthority
2004-12-09T08:20:00.000Z	grelli		has anyone else been seeing this
2004-12-09T08:20:00.000Z	LinuxJones	grelli	ya you have k3b installed
