2004-09-26T15:20:00.000Z	xTina		hi
2004-09-26T15:21:00.000Z	xTina		Is it just my system, or does the preview release ISO for PPC reliably crash DiskUtility on Mac OS X when trying to burn?
2004-09-26T15:23:00.000Z	mdz	xTina	I haven't used that particular tool, but I can burn the image fine with Linux and GNOME tools
2004-09-26T15:23:00.000Z	xTina	mdz	The PPC one?
2004-09-26T15:30:00.000Z	mdz	xTina	yes, the powerpc one
2004-09-26T15:31:00.000Z	xTina	mdz	I think it's not broken by itself, at least not totally, since I can also mount it here.
2004-09-26T15:31:00.000Z	mdz	xTina	agreed
2004-09-26T15:31:00.000Z	xTina	mdz	It just seems to disagree with DiskUtility

2004-09-27T16:33:00.000Z	xTina	mdz	Ah, thanks.
2004-09-27T07:48:00.000Z	mdz	xTina	is their bug tracking system public?  it would be great to have a URL we could give people so they could follow the issue, since more people will run into this
2004-09-27T07:49:00.000Z	xTina	mdz	No, it is not. You need to be an ADC member to access it (there's a free online membership though, if anyone is willing to go through the application forms to file the bug).
2004-09-27T07:49:00.000Z	mdz	xTina	is there a bug ID number or anything like that?
2004-09-27T07:52:00.000Z	xTina	mdz	If you have the time, you might want to try to build a slightly modified ISO. As I said before, I never had a problem with it before that. Or put an FAQ somewhere ;)
2004-09-27T07:53:00.000Z	mdz	xTina	yeah, we never ran into this with previous CD builds, it must just be how it happened to be assembled
2004-09-27T07:54:00.000Z	mdz	xTina	if you file a bug in our bugzilla, I'll use that to collect information about the problem, and to notify folks if we find a workaround or if the next CD is known to avoid the issue
2004-09-27T07:55:00.000Z	mdz	xTina	http://bugzilla.ubuntulinux.org/
2004-09-27T08:01:00.000Z	xTina	mdz	Hm. Seems Bugzilla is slow sending out passwords.
