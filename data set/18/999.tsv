2012-02-15T19:56:00.000Z	anli__		Is there an application I can run on the command line, piping in data that will as a result go into the clipboard?
2012-02-15T19:57:00.000Z	theadmin	anli__	Well, the clipboard is an X thing
2012-02-15T19:57:00.000Z	anli__		yes?
2012-02-15T19:57:00.000Z	theadmin	anli__	But... there is xclip which does that.
2012-02-15T19:57:00.000Z	theadmin		!info xclip | anli_
2012-02-15T19:57:00.000Z	anli__		ah, must check
2012-02-15T19:57:00.000Z	anli__		tried ls -l | xclip
2012-02-15T19:58:00.000Z	theadmin	anli__	You need to install it first though
2012-02-15T19:58:00.000Z	anli__		Its already installed
2012-02-15T19:59:00.000Z	theadmin	anli__	I have to point out that it uses the global X keyboard, not your desktops. So, middle-click to paste what has been copied by xclip. You can also just select some text and middle-click to paste the selected text, works in any desktop
2012-02-15T19:59:00.000Z	theadmin		err
2012-02-15T20:00:00.000Z	theadmin		s/keyboard/clipboard/
2012-02-15T20:00:00.000Z	theadmin		wtf brain
2012-02-15T20:00:00.000Z	anli__	theadmin	Seems that I cannot paste using programs menus, I have to use the middle mouse button
2012-02-15T20:00:00.000Z	theadmin	anli__	Yesh, just explained why
2012-02-15T20:00:00.000Z	anli__		In other words, ubuntu has its own clipboard that xclip does not interact with
2012-02-15T20:00:00.000Z	anli__		oh, sorry
2012-02-15T20:00:00.000Z	theadmin	anli__	Gnome has it's own clipboard, yeah
