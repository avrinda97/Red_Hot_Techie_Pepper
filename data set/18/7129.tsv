2008-04-20T00:49:00.000Z	Seveas	sagredo	anywhere you fancy
2008-04-20T00:43:00.000Z	sagredo	Seveas	You are both elegent and a gentleman
2008-04-20T00:48:00.000Z	sagredo	Seveas	how can I see all available mount points? Such as /dev/cdrom
2008-04-20T00:49:00.000Z	Seveas	sagredo	every folder is a potential mountpoint
2008-04-20T00:49:00.000Z	Seveas	sagredo	use 'mount' without arguments to see current mounts
2008-04-20T00:49:00.000Z	sagredo	Seveas	which mount point should I use to mount an iso?
2008-04-20T00:50:00.000Z	sagredo	Seveas	my logic is not mounting this DVD iso correctly
2008-04-20T00:52:00.000Z	sagredo	Seveas	can you tell me more abount mounting an iso?
2008-04-20T00:53:00.000Z	Seveas	sagredo	mount -o loop -t filesystem-on-the-iso-file /path/to/iso /path/to/mountpoint
2008-04-20T00:53:00.000Z	Seveas	sagredo	'file /path/to/iso' should identify the filesystem
2008-04-20T00:54:00.000Z	sagredo	Seveas	let me show you how I entered the command
2008-04-20T01:00:00.000Z	sagredo	Seveas	why not worky? sudo mount -o loop /home/sagredo/Elements Of Life/DVD1/dt-eoliwtc_a.r06_FILES/ELEMENTS_OF_LIFE.ISO /home/sagredo
2008-04-20T01:01:00.000Z	Seveas	sagredo	put "" around the filename
2008-04-20T01:04:00.000Z	sagredo	Seveas	it appears the command was ran, however, no video is playing (I'm trying to watch a DVD)
2008-04-20T01:04:00.000Z	sagredo	Seveas	rather, is running
2009-02-08T01:56:00.000Z	sagredo	Seveas	can you tell me what might be in the contects of this bash script, run at 15 seconds: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNQ6W_yUnII
2009-02-08T01:56:00.000Z	Seveas	sagredo	I have no flash on this box
2009-02-08T01:57:00.000Z	sagredo	Seveas	thanks anyway
