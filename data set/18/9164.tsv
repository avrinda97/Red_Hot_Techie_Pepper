2007-05-01T05:19:00.000Z	SasquatchNL		hi, how can I set both dhcp and static addresses using only the interfases file?
2007-05-01T05:20:00.000Z	SasquatchNL		for one interface
2007-05-01T05:21:00.000Z	stefg	SasquatchNL	as i understand you you want mutually exclusive things ... either you get an IP by dhcp, or you define one
2007-05-01T05:22:00.000Z	SasquatchNL	stefg	I want to enable dhcp, but if it can't find a dhcp server, it switches to manual
2007-05-01T05:23:00.000Z	stefg	SasquatchNL	network-manager?
2007-05-01T05:24:00.000Z	SasquatchNL	stefg	when I set it manual, it works great, but I also want to be able to connecto using dhcp for another wireless network
2007-05-01T05:24:00.000Z	stefg	SasquatchNL	network-manager is meant for that scenario
2007-05-01T05:25:00.000Z	SasquatchNL	stefg	I know, but I can't seem to get it running properly, I even treid kwlan but that doesn't work either, they won't allow me to use wpa
2007-05-01T05:26:00.000Z	stefg	SasquatchNL	so issue sudo dhclient <interface> that will override the manual IP when it finds something
2007-05-01T05:27:00.000Z	SasquatchNL	stefg	I can't test the dhcp thing now, have to wait untill school starts again, but I will sure test it once I can
2007-05-01T05:29:00.000Z	stefg	SasquatchNL	so if you cat use network-manager to automate things for you. you'd define another profile in the network applet.
2007-05-01T05:31:00.000Z	SasquatchNL	stefg	something like "iface home inet static" in the interface file?
2007-05-01T05:32:00.000Z	stefg	SasquatchNL	i'm not sure if yu can call your interface 'home'... i don't think it'll work
2007-05-01T05:33:00.000Z	SasquatchNL	stefg	I could pastebin my interface and wpa_supplicant.conf if you like
2007-05-01T05:34:00.000Z	stefg	SasquatchNL	no use... i'm not that familiar with wifi. Why don't you just use the GUI applet to define a second profile, get a systray icon and switch your profile there?
2007-05-01T05:34:00.000Z	SasquatchNL	stefg	if your first suggestion about dhclient works, I will use that
2007-05-01T05:35:00.000Z	stefg	SasquatchNL	that's likely to work, if the card is set up properly
2007-05-01T05:35:00.000Z	SasquatchNL	stefg	it's something I got used to when I use windows, it timesout my dhcp request, switches to static and I have to manually request a new ip. Will see it next week, thanks for your help
