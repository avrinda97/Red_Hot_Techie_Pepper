2005-11-10T10:04:00.000Z	CyberDoo		My sound sounds crappy. Too much treble, any ideas on how to change this?
2005-11-10T10:06:00.000Z	soundray	CyberDoo	have you excluded hardware problems?
2005-11-10T10:07:00.000Z	CyberDoo	soundray	This sound problem didn't exist under the previous version of ubuntu.
2005-11-10T10:07:00.000Z	soundray	CyberDoo	mixer settings?
2005-11-10T10:08:00.000Z	CyberDoo	soundray	the mixer controls seem to work fine, but my card doesn't seem to have tone control, or alsa seems to think so, so I can't adjust them.
2005-11-10T10:08:00.000Z	soundray	CyberDoo	problem first occurred after Breezy upgrade?
2005-11-10T10:09:00.000Z	CyberDoo	soundray	yes. My sound was great till then.
2005-11-10T10:09:00.000Z	CyberDoo	soundray	I didn't have tone control under the previous version either.
2005-11-10T10:09:00.000Z	CyberDoo	soundray	but the sound was good.
2005-11-10T10:09:00.000Z	soundray	CyberDoo	do you have any other OS installed?
2005-11-10T10:10:00.000Z	CyberDoo	soundray	nope. All my machines run some version of linux.
2005-11-10T10:10:00.000Z	soundray	CyberDoo	any live CD's lying around? Knoppix, Kanotix, DSL?
2005-11-10T10:11:00.000Z	CyberDoo	soundray	yeah Knoppix 3.2.
2005-11-10T10:11:00.000Z	soundray	CyberDoo	how's the sound if you boot from that?
2005-11-10T10:11:00.000Z	soundray	CyberDoo	2.6 kernel preferably
2005-11-10T10:12:00.000Z	CyberDoo	soundray	I'll download the latest version and give it a spin. It would eliminate any hardware problems, as well as possible 2.6 kernel problems.
2005-11-10T10:13:00.000Z	soundray	CyberDoo	good luck
2005-11-10T10:13:00.000Z	CyberDoo	soundray	thanks.
