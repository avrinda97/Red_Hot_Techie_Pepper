2011-12-10T21:57:00.000Z	HQRaja	Myrtti	Awesome...that sounds like exactly what I'm looking for =)
2011-12-10T21:57:00.000Z	HQRaja		+1
2011-12-10T21:58:00.000Z	Myrtti	HQRaja	do you use Unity or Gnome-Shell?
2011-12-10T21:58:00.000Z	HQRaja	Myrtti	Unity
2011-12-10T21:58:00.000Z	Myrtti	HQRaja	in that case you might be interested in gm-notify as well
2011-12-10T21:58:00.000Z	HQRaja	Myrtti	In addition to gnome-gmail or as an alternative?
2011-12-10T21:59:00.000Z	Myrtti	HQRaja	I use both, but have added gnome-gmail to messaging menu blacklist
2011-12-10T21:59:00.000Z	HQRaja	Myrtti	I see...otherwise both notify you?
2011-12-10T22:00:00.000Z	Myrtti	HQRaja	otherwise gnome-gmail shows up in the messaging menu without a specific purpose other than being there, gm-notify does a better job in the notification front
2011-12-10T22:01:00.000Z	HQRaja	Myrtti	Ah I see...thanks. Since you've mentioned it, how do I add apps to blacklist of the messaging menu? I see a couple of apps there with mere entries there, without doing anything.
2011-12-10T22:02:00.000Z	HQRaja		PS: When I change my online status from the Messaging menu, which IM app does it effect? I have Pidgin and Emesene installed in addition to the default Empathy that shipped with Ubuntu
2011-12-10T22:03:00.000Z	Myrtti	HQRaja	mkdir -p ~/.config/indicators/messages/applications-blacklist/
2011-12-10T22:04:00.000Z	Myrtti	HQRaja	then make symlinks there to whichever apps you want not to be visible to /usr/share/indicators/messages/applications

2011-12-10T22:04:00.000Z	HQRaja	Myrtti	Awesome...thanks a bunch =)
2011-12-10T22:04:00.000Z	Myrtti	HQRaja	on the IM issue - no clue, I'm happy with Empathy now that it actually works nicely with Gtalk video chat
2011-12-10T22:05:00.000Z	HQRaja	Myrtti	I see...yeah Empathy is pretty neat but I guess I'll have to get used to its UI which seems rather too 'empty' to someone coming from Windows
