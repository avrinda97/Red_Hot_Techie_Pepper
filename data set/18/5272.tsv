2009-04-27T08:41:00.000Z	CuriosTiger		I did -- mostly to see how ext4 performs
2009-04-27T08:41:00.000Z	CuriosTiger		double-click on the suggested / partition and change the type to ext4
2009-04-27T08:41:00.000Z	CuriosTiger		performance improvements and some added features
2009-04-27T08:43:00.000Z	CuriosTiger		Seriously.
2009-04-27T08:43:00.000Z	CuriosTiger		Can anyone offer me a suggestion on how to get the proprietary nvidia video driver to work with Xorg in Jaunty?
2009-04-27T08:44:00.000Z	CuriosTiger		once you mount an ext4 file system with the new options, older linux systems can no longer read it
2009-04-27T08:44:00.000Z	CuriosTiger		egos: it's pretty much abandonware since Hans Reiser went to jail and his company collapsed, though
2009-04-27T08:46:00.000Z	CuriosTiger		it's also a package manager, but limited, like crdlb said
2009-04-27T08:47:00.000Z	CuriosTiger		apt-get dist-upgrade from potato to woody hosed a debian system for me spectacularly once
2009-04-27T08:47:00.000Z	CuriosTiger		:P
2009-04-27T08:48:00.000Z	carsonc	CuriosTiger	Wasn't that the libc5 -> libc6 transition on Debian?
2009-04-27T08:48:00.000Z	CuriosTiger	carsonc	Yes.
2009-04-27T08:49:00.000Z	CuriosTiger	carsonc	Which was also the problem
2009-04-27T08:49:00.000Z	CuriosTiger	carsonc	apt-get replaced my libc.so.1
2009-04-27T08:49:00.000Z	CuriosTiger		or glibc.so.1 rather
2009-04-27T08:49:00.000Z	CuriosTiger		which basically made every binary on the system shit itself
2009-04-27T08:49:00.000Z	carsonc		Yeah, I remember that upgrade.  I think I just said screw it and installed from scratch
2009-04-27T08:50:00.000Z	CuriosTiger	carsonc	I said screw it and installed redhat ;)
