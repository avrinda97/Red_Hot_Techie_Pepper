2008-02-29T08:43:00.000Z	killerbeesateme	Estesark	have you tried --force?
2008-02-29T08:47:00.000Z	killerbeesateme	Estesark	 i had the exact same problem about 6 months ago, and for the life of me, i can't remember what i did
2008-02-29T08:47:00.000Z	killerbeesateme	Estesark	 bear with me here, i'm trying to recreate my google steps
2008-02-29T08:48:00.000Z	Estesark	killerbeesateme	I just tried sudo dpkg --purge -a, and it downloaded all the files succesfully
2008-02-29T08:48:00.000Z	Estesark	killerbeesateme	Perhaps there was a network problem
2008-02-29T08:48:00.000Z	Estesark	killerbeesateme	So now I'm going to try removing it again
2008-02-29T08:48:00.000Z	killerbeesateme	Estesark	i think i got it
2008-02-29T08:51:00.000Z	Estesark	killerbeesateme	It's not in that list, because like I said, last time I tried to --purge it, it succesfully configured
2008-02-29T08:51:00.000Z	Estesark	killerbeesateme	But now I can't remove or purge it - turns out that --purge actually just configured it
2008-02-29T08:53:00.000Z	Estesark	killerbeesateme	Take a look at http://ubuntu.pastebin.com/d1949f532
2008-02-29T08:54:00.000Z	killerbeesateme	Estesark	Did you try the steps from above?
2008-02-29T08:55:00.000Z	Estesark	killerbeesateme	It wasn't in that list, because it succesfully configured in the end
2008-02-29T08:55:00.000Z	Estesark	killerbeesateme	 I just can't uninstall it now
2008-02-29T08:55:00.000Z	killerbeesateme	Estesark	so where is it freezing up again?  sorry i cleared my scroll log
2008-02-29T08:56:00.000Z	Estesark	killerbeesateme	It's not freezing any more, it just won't uninstall
2008-02-29T08:58:00.000Z	Estesark	killerbeesateme	Success! Turns out someone else has had the same problem: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=649819

2008-02-29T08:59:00.000Z	Estesark	killerbeesateme	Yeah. That'll teach me to flirt with Microsoft.
