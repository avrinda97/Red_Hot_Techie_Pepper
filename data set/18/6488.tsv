2008-05-06T17:53:00.000Z	lucent		forgot the bug # but it's being addressed
2008-05-06T17:54:00.000Z	lucent		either it's CFS, it's bad interaction between Nvidia graphics and Flash, or other
2008-05-06T17:54:00.000Z	lucent		run it
2008-05-06T17:54:00.000Z	lucent		pray to whatever god you believe in
2008-05-06T17:55:00.000Z	lucent		hm
2008-05-06T17:55:00.000Z	lucent		like searching for files or copying large files?
2008-05-06T17:57:00.000Z	lucent		back your stuff up if you buy seagates
2008-05-06T17:57:00.000Z	lucent		they will fail in the first 3 months if they are going to fail at all
2008-05-06T17:57:00.000Z	lucent		other manufacturers of drives are sort of a mixed lot.  You can count on seagate drives to fail quickly if they're lemons
2008-05-06T17:58:00.000Z	lucent		what the hell?

2008-12-19T11:32:00.000Z	lucent	bazhang	so I'm working the other day, and I hear a story about a Russian guy... he knows maybe only a few words of English, and walks into the theater.. He points at the icecream and announses "GIVE ME DOVE BAR".   that's the kind of thing that goes in #ubuntu-offtopic right?
