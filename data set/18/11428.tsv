2006-07-27T15:34:00.000Z	aninhumer	roostishaw	was that all it said?
2006-07-27T15:35:00.000Z	roostishaw	aninhumer	yes. that was the output
2006-07-27T15:35:00.000Z	aninhumer	roostishaw	I'm assuming you already have build-essential?
2006-07-27T15:36:00.000Z	roostishaw	aninhumer	yes.
2006-07-27T15:36:00.000Z	aninhumer	roostishaw	as I think someone said, is there a log file?
2006-07-27T15:36:00.000Z	roostishaw	aninhumer	um... where might i look for this?
2006-07-27T15:37:00.000Z	aninhumer	roostishaw	what exactly did you do to get that error?
2006-07-27T15:38:00.000Z	roostishaw	aninhumer	i ran   sudo apt-get build-dep wpasupplicant
2006-07-27T15:41:00.000Z	aninhumer	roostishaw	was there a problem installing it from the normal repository?
2006-07-27T15:41:00.000Z	roostishaw	aninhumer	havn't tried. the guide for wpa, in the forums, says to do it
2006-07-27T15:42:00.000Z	aninhumer	roostishaw	you might want to try the normal install first, (infact it looks like it's a standard package)
2006-07-27T15:43:00.000Z	roostishaw	aninhumer	sorry, but what do you mean by "normal"?
2006-07-27T15:44:00.000Z	aninhumer	roostishaw	either "sudo apt-get install wpasupplicant" or using synaptic
2006-07-27T15:45:00.000Z	roostishaw	aninhumer	ok, ill try it, thanks!
