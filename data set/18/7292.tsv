2011-07-29T22:14:00.000Z	Reaper		Is there a way to adjust the screensaver on this?
2011-07-29T22:14:00.000Z	Reaper		how do I get to the settings?
2011-07-29T22:14:00.000Z	Reaper		lol

2011-07-29T22:15:00.000Z	Reaper		11.04
2011-07-29T22:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Reaper	there is Natty xubuntu.
2011-07-29T22:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Reaper	ubuntu is based on gnome. Xubuntu is based on xfce, so saying you use Natty doesn't tell us your desktop environment ;)
2011-07-29T22:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Reaper	if you click the power button in the top right you will se the settings there
2011-07-29T22:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Reaper	more than likely yes
2011-07-30T21:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Reaper	sudo apt-get -y install wine
2011-07-30T21:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Reaper	i'd check the appdb. Your app may need wine 1.3 or not even work at all
2011-10-27T19:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Reaper	why?
2011-10-27T19:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Reaper	what GPU?
2011-10-27T19:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Reaper	lspci | grep -i vga   will say
2011-10-27T19:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Reaper	could install lxde in ubuntu
2011-10-27T19:40:00.000Z	Reaper	ActionParsnip	I would but its so buggy witht the gnome fall back. its just horrible.
2011-10-27T19:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Reaper	with lxde, the gnome desktop won't show its face
2011-10-27T19:42:00.000Z	Reaper	ActionParsnip	so far gnome wont let me use the monitor connected to my laptop says the graphics are too high for the machine. will lxde fix this or should i try to reinstall 11.10 again?
