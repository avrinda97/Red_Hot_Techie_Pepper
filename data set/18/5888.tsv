2008-08-09T22:20:00.000Z	underandy		When partitionating ubuntu, shall I set any mount options for my partitions+
2008-08-09T22:21:00.000Z	qr	underandy	if you don't know then the defaults should be fine
2008-08-09T22:30:00.000Z	qr	underandy	whatever softwhere you want to have (really, this is the only workable answer that can be given to that question)
2008-08-09T22:31:00.000Z	underandy	qr	if I choose Ubuntu-desktop, just the programs for gnome downloads?
2008-08-09T22:31:00.000Z	qr	underandy	the whole ubuntu desktop suite of programs comes with that package
2008-08-09T22:33:00.000Z	underandy	qr	is there a way of just installing gnome?
2008-08-10T21:34:00.000Z	qr	underandy	what's wrong with the defaults?
2008-08-17T22:55:00.000Z	qr	underandy	yes, sftp transfers files over ssh.
2008-08-17T22:56:00.000Z	underandy	qr	any way to disable sftp? so I can use my vsftpd (ftps) instead
2008-08-17T22:56:00.000Z	qr	underandy	you don't need to disable it, you just need to connect using a regular ftp connection to get the ftp server.
2008-08-17T22:58:00.000Z	underandy	qr	how to?
2008-08-17T22:58:00.000Z	qr	underandy	when you connect to your machine using filezilla use regular ftp instead of sftp.
2008-08-17T22:59:00.000Z	underandy	qr	that doesent work :///
2008-08-17T22:59:00.000Z	qr	underandy	then your ftp server is not configured correctly.
2008-08-17T22:59:00.000Z	underandy	qr	wierd
