2011-03-26T17:31:00.000Z	truepurple		Can different linux distros on the same hard drive, share the same swap partition?
2011-03-26T17:33:00.000Z	truepurple		Swedemike: I was told that the swap space had to have its own partion, specifically can not be on the same partition space as the OS, are you saying this is wrong?
2011-03-26T17:34:00.000Z	kellnola_	truepurple	linux can use swap files, it does have to be a partition at all
2011-03-26T17:36:00.000Z	truepurple	kellnola_	sure without a shadow of a doubt?
2011-03-26T17:37:00.000Z	kellnola_	truepurple	yes, since I've used them many times
2011-03-26T17:39:00.000Z	truepurple	kellnola_	That swap file running on the same partition as linux?
2011-03-26T17:42:00.000Z	truepurple	kellnola_	That swap file running on the same partition as linux?
2011-03-26T17:43:00.000Z	kellnola_	truepurple	YES. god. "man mkswap"
2011-03-26T17:51:00.000Z	truepurple	kellnola_	So should I just set up the partition for linux to install on for now, then I can set up extended logic drives from within the linux installation itself?

2011-03-26T17:54:00.000Z	kellnola_	truepurple	of course. or you can do everything in the installer
2011-03-26T17:55:00.000Z	truepurple	kellnola_	How do I install extended logic drives from within the installer? I don't even see information about whether a drive is primary or extended

2011-03-26T17:58:00.000Z	kellnola_	truepurple	not sure about the graphical install since I've always used the alternate cd or upgraded in place. The gui installer does hide a lot from you, especially with setting up your filesystems
2011-03-26T17:59:00.000Z	truepurple	kellnola_	But doing it from the ubuntu install itself is much easier?
2011-03-26T18:15:00.000Z	truepurple	kellnola_	You there?
2011-03-26T18:37:00.000Z	kellnola_	truepurple	that's a windows mentality :)
2011-03-26T18:40:00.000Z	kellnola_	truepurple	loss of a little disk space, that's all
