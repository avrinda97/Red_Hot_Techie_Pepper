2005-08-24T15:06:00.000Z	oonoon		i can't believe win runs little c++ programs much faster than linux
2005-08-24T15:07:00.000Z	LinuxJones	oonoon	what do you mean ?
2005-08-24T15:08:00.000Z	oonoon	LinuxJones	: run some stupid program that counts to one billion, u'll see that win runs it 5 to 10% faster than linux does... really surprising ; i'm a bitdisappointed
2005-08-24T15:09:00.000Z	LinuxJones	oonoon	well do you have unnecessary stuff running in the background or are other users logged in ?
2005-08-24T15:12:00.000Z	oonoon	LinuxJones	: nothing, I even tried to quit X, to improve as much, but yet, win's the fastest grrrrr
2005-08-24T15:16:00.000Z	LinuxJones	oonoon	so now Microsoft is 400 % slower now ?
2005-08-24T15:17:00.000Z	oonoon	LinuxJones	yeah , MS is beaten, by far
2005-08-24T15:18:00.000Z	LinuxJones	oonoon	that would make a great "Unbiased TCO Study" for development environments :D
2005-08-24T15:18:00.000Z	oonoon	LinuxJones	yeah, my comparative study does not pretend to any kind of generality ;)
2005-08-24T15:19:00.000Z	LinuxJones	oonoon	;)
2005-08-26T16:32:00.000Z	LinuxJones	oonoon	yeah fine for general desktop stuff but not for 3d games
2005-08-26T16:32:00.000Z	oonoon	LinuxJones	when i launch a screensaver preview, the shit is slow like hell, i dont understand where does it come from (there're no heavy app running in the background)
2005-08-26T16:33:00.000Z	LinuxJones	oonoon	yeah it's probably a 3d screensaver
2005-08-26T16:34:00.000Z	oonoon	LinuxJones	do we really need a 3000 FPS to run correctly a simple 3d screensaver ? (in fact, that's very slow even for 2d screensaver, like Matrix)
2005-08-26T16:35:00.000Z	LinuxJones	oonoon	I am just guessing that's the problem, most monitors these days don't even need a screensaver.
2005-08-26T09:16:00.000Z	LinuxJones	oonoon	what makes you say something like that ?
2005-08-26T09:19:00.000Z	oonoon	LinuxJones	: my stuff with nvidia card and samba for network
2005-08-26T09:19:00.000Z	oonoon	LinuxJones	: things work sometimes, and then it doesn't anymore for an unknown reason, and then i must start everything from the beginning and it works again, but it's quite tiring to reinstall everything everytime
