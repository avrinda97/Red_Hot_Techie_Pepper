2009-05-07T18:57:00.000Z	dean__	indus	perhaps make a cron job as a quick fix?
2009-05-07T18:51:00.000Z	dean__	indus	Not today
2009-05-07T18:51:00.000Z	dean__	indus	but there were a few on Monday
2009-05-07T18:51:00.000Z	indus	dean__	when was the last update?
2009-05-07T18:52:00.000Z	indus	dean__	huh monday? which ones? i didnt get any
2009-05-07T18:52:00.000Z	indus	dean__	 this update manager has left me anxious and irritated
2009-05-07T18:53:00.000Z	indus	dean__	no dean i want to see if old update manager behaviour is restored and icon shows itself when updates are ready
2009-05-07T18:56:00.000Z	dean__	indus	hmm, well I can't help you with that then, I've no idea how to check the auto update functionality
2009-05-07T18:56:00.000Z	dean__	indus	Of course, have you checked that the correct "install updates" checkboxes are checked in the software sources screen?
2009-05-07T18:57:00.000Z	indus	dean__	iam getting updates no issues but need to manually run update manager which sucks
2009-05-07T18:58:00.000Z	indus	dean__	hehe no i want the ubuntu devs to do their job, or i take money for it :P
2009-05-07T18:59:00.000Z	dean__	indus	sorry, other than the auto updates checkboxes I don't know how to ensure it's working
2009-05-07T19:00:00.000Z	indus	dean__	np dean its not a serious thing
2009-05-07T19:00:00.000Z	dean__	indus	perhaps you're set to auto install updates?
2009-05-07T19:00:00.000Z	indus	dean__	nvm
2009-05-07T19:01:00.000Z	indus	dean__	GNIGHT
