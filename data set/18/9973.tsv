2007-01-25T07:30:00.000Z	yulewang	bulmer	it works fine in fedora core, but i do not like fedora core,
2007-01-25T07:30:00.000Z	yulewang	bulmer	I try pppoeconf and it cannot find eth0 or smth.
2007-01-25T07:34:00.000Z	bulmer	yulewang	what shows up on your /etc/network/interfaces  ?
2007-01-25T07:37:00.000Z	yulewang	bulmer	 now i have only fc installed, so i can not show your my /etc/network/interface. I have 3 computers, for other two computers, I just install ubuntu, have my pppoeconf configured and try pon dsl-provider, and it works
2007-01-25T07:38:00.000Z	yulewang	bulmer	but this machine, i failed to do so, because  it says i do not have eth0. so i think my driver is not right.
2007-01-25T07:39:00.000Z	bulmer	yulewang	does your eth0 shows up in dmesg?
2007-01-25T07:41:00.000Z	yulewang	bulmer	i run modprobe e100/e1000/eepro100, and i can see it in dmesg. but still no eth0
2007-01-25T07:43:00.000Z	bulmer	yulewang	maybe it is not eth0, you have other nic cards? maybe it is ath0?
2007-01-25T07:44:00.000Z	yulewang	bulmer	whatever it is , when i run pppoeconf, it should appear, however, when i try pppoeconf, it said "no ethernet card detected"
2007-01-25T07:45:00.000Z	yulewang	bulmer	and i surf the web, many people have the same problem with SUSE,Fedora etc said that when upgrade to 2.6.19/20 kernel, they can use it
2007-01-25T07:46:00.000Z	yulewang	bulmer	 but in ubuntu, i cannot rebuild the kernel because I can not get the gcc or header file or something from the internet
2007-01-25T07:48:00.000Z	bulmer	yulewang	umm what shows up in your /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf  ?
2007-01-25T07:49:00.000Z	yulewang	bulmer	I remove the dapper installtion. now I only have fc installed. I just want to ask how can I use a 2.6.19 kernel without link to the internet
2007-01-25T07:50:00.000Z	yulewang	bulmer	If i have the 2.6.19 kernel, maybe my problem will be solved
