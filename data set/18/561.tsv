2012-11-14T03:10:00.000Z	Daxter		nyone know why moving a 10.04 install to a new computer causes virtualbox VMs (and minecraft too) to fail to start?
2012-11-14T03:10:00.000Z	ikonia	Daxter	how did you move it ?
2012-11-14T03:11:00.000Z	Daxter	ikonia	moved physical HDD containing install and its swap partition
2012-11-14T03:11:00.000Z	ikonia	Daxter	what happens when you try to start them ?
2012-11-14T03:11:00.000Z	ikonia	Daxter	is the hardware the same ?
2012-11-14T03:12:00.000Z	Daxter	ikonia	minecraft blackscreens, virtualbox vms is stuck at 0% starting
2012-11-14T03:12:00.000Z	ikonia	Daxter	different video card ?
2012-11-14T03:12:00.000Z	ikonia	Daxter	no they are not, LTS releases can upgrade to non-LTS releases just fine
2012-11-14T03:13:00.000Z	Daxter	ikonia	different everything. old cpu: AMD athlon 64 new cpu: Intel core i5-750 old gfx: nvidia geforce gt240, new: geforce gtx280
2012-11-14T03:13:00.000Z	ikonia	Daxter	, so that's something I'd look at resolving
2012-11-14T03:14:00.000Z	Daxter	ikonia	for the lts release software sources isnt set to show upgrade to non-lts releass, at least in 10.04
2012-11-14T03:14:00.000Z	ikonia	Daxter	yes, so you can get set it to what you want
2012-11-14T03:14:00.000Z	ikonia	Daxter	that does'nt mean it's not designed to be upgraded to non-lts releases.
2012-11-14T03:17:00.000Z	ikonia	Daxter	so your hardware has changed, there will be modules that will need to be loaded and old ones stopped, especially around the video card
2012-11-14T03:18:00.000Z	Daxter	ikonia	reinstall graphics drivers? its the same family of gfx cards tho
2012-11-14T03:19:00.000Z	ikonia	Daxter	also look at the virtualisation modules,
2012-11-14T03:19:00.000Z	Daxter	ikonia	what I dont get is ive reinstalled virtualsbox a few times now
2012-11-14T03:19:00.000Z	ikonia	Daxter	i didn't say reinstall
