2009-07-26T07:39:00.000Z	alex__		Does anyone know if you can make it so when you use the volume control on your keyboard, the little box that shows where the volume is at doesn't come up?
2009-07-26T07:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	alex__	mine works out of the box ;)
2009-07-26T07:41:00.000Z	alex__	ActionParsnip	Maybe your wireless, but if you have a gfx card you had to install a driver =P
2009-07-26T07:42:00.000Z	alex__	ActionParsnip	My wireless card is REALLY old... so I guess they never put drivers in the kernal for it...
2009-07-26T07:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	alex__	true but its part of my setup script, rips out about a gig of guff, installs java, flash and install nvidia driver then adds network config files and dns settings. Good times
2009-07-26T07:43:00.000Z	alex__	ActionParsnip	That's more complicated than netlarip is planning on getting into ;)
2009-07-26T08:10:00.000Z	alex__	ActionParsnip	Any reason not to just use the plugin from the repositories?
