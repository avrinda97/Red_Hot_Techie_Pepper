2006-10-20T13:42:00.000Z	islan		is there a way to keep the audio from going out of sync in streaming video with mplayer?
2006-10-20T13:42:00.000Z	ezerhoden	islan	yes
2006-10-20T13:42:00.000Z	ezerhoden	islan	once sec
2006-10-20T13:42:00.000Z	islan	ezerhoden	really?  wow, I was just shooting in the dark, thanks
2006-10-20T13:43:00.000Z	ezerhoden	islan	- and Shift + keys
2006-10-20T13:43:00.000Z	ezerhoden	islan	man mplayer will show alot of cool stuff
2006-10-20T13:43:00.000Z	islan	ezerhoden	k, thanks
2006-10-20T13:44:00.000Z	ezerhoden	islan	bugged me till i dived into the man page one booring day
2006-10-20T13:44:00.000Z	islan	ezerhoden	do I just click on the streaming video itself and hit those keys (don't want to get mixed up with firefox hot-keys just in case)
2006-10-20T13:45:00.000Z	ezerhoden	islan	yes
2006-10-20T13:45:00.000Z	islan	ezerhoden	groovey, didn't think the plugin would be helped by the man page
2006-10-20T13:45:00.000Z	ezerhoden		ahh, plug-in i dont know
2006-10-20T13:45:00.000Z	ezerhoden	islan	^^
2006-10-20T13:46:00.000Z	ezerhoden	islan	never tried it that way
2006-10-20T13:46:00.000Z	ezerhoden	islan	let me know  if it works
2006-10-20T13:46:00.000Z	islan	ezerhoden	oh, well, that's how I get my streaming video.  the audio is in sync from the beginning, but then the video starts going ahead of it
2006-10-20T13:48:00.000Z	islan	ezerhoden	oh, it's not mplayer, it's flash player 7, and flash doesn't seem to ever work very good on ubuntu
2006-10-20T13:49:00.000Z	ezerhoden	islan	hopefully flash 9 will be better
