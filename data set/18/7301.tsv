2009-09-15T16:02:00.000Z	obiwan__		hi please, i need to know how to look built modules in my kernel. I have to do this:   Validate you don't have loaded (or built into the kernel) the Linux community provided  driver for Broadcom hardware
2009-09-15T16:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	obiwan__	sudo apt-get install subversion
2009-09-15T16:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	obiwan__	sorry crossed lines
2009-09-15T16:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	obiwan__	if you run: lsmod you can see all loaded modules
2009-09-22T15:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	obiwan__	if you run: /msg ubottu hi
2009-09-22T15:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	obiwan__	you can freely pick her brain
2009-09-22T16:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	obiwan__	why are you concerned about what is usualy
2009-09-22T16:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	obiwan__	the "usual" anything will change as the users do in the channel
2009-09-22T16:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	obiwan__	if they are in the repo they are all equally support
2009-09-22T16:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	obiwan__	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/VPNClient
2009-09-22T16:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	obiwan__	if you asked in 2 days, you might get a different answer so "most used" is moot and doesnt exist
2009-09-22T16:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	obiwan__	each app has a man pae made by the devs
2009-09-22T16:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	obiwan__	there will be guides for any app you can use
2009-09-22T16:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	obiwan__	man cp is clear as day
2010-01-14T03:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	obiwan__	telnet 192.168.0.1   (or whatever the address is)
2010-01-14T03:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	obiwan__	same as windows
2010-01-14T03:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	obiwan__	if you run: route    it will output the default route which will bne the ip, 192.168.0.1 is a good first try thouggh as most home grade routers use that address
2010-01-14T03:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	obiwan__	you got it then ;)
