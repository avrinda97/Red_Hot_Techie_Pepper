2010-10-31T23:34:00.000Z	vigge_sWe		I have some weird problem going on again
2010-10-31T23:34:00.000Z	vigge_sWe		all the window borders are gone
2010-10-31T23:34:00.000Z	vigge_sWe		so I cannot focus on anything else than xchat
2010-10-31T23:35:00.000Z	dborba	vigge_sWe	try to go to the appearance preferences in the system>preferences menu and changing it back and forth
2010-10-31T23:35:00.000Z	dborba	vigge_sWe	try what i suggested & let me know what happens
2010-10-31T23:37:00.000Z	vigge_sWe	dborba	still no borders
2010-10-31T23:38:00.000Z	dborba	vigge_sWe	try "metacity --replace" from a terminal or run window
2010-10-31T23:42:00.000Z	dborba	vigge_sWe	your window manager might have crashed, did you try running metacity or metacity --replace?
2010-10-31T23:42:00.000Z	vigge_sWe	dborba	I can't as only xchat's textarea has focus
2010-10-31T23:42:00.000Z	dborba	vigge_sWe	press alt+f2 and type in metacity
2010-10-31T23:43:00.000Z	dborba	vigge_sWe	alt+f2 should auto focus its input line
2010-10-31T23:43:00.000Z	dborba	vigge_sWe	wtf :\
2010-10-31T23:44:00.000Z	dborba	vigge_sWe	if you're keys are gone you really gotta log back in or reboot...
2010-10-31T23:48:00.000Z	vigge_sWe	dborba	terminal will autoexecute commands if there are more than one line of commands, right?
2010-10-31T23:49:00.000Z	dborba	vigge_sWe	nope
2010-10-31T23:50:00.000Z	dborba	vigge_sWe	if you type in a command, press return, another command, press return - it will execute the second command when the first one is done if thats what you mean
2010-10-31T23:50:00.000Z	dborba	vigge_sWe	if they are on the same line you need to separate them with a ; or && to execute both as a single process
