2008-03-06T20:32:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	db92	Sure can try.. what video card?
2008-03-06T20:34:00.000Z	db92	Jack_Sparrow	atm i have radeon 3870, but this is mainly for my gaming partition of windows
2008-03-06T20:34:00.000Z	db92	Jack_Sparrow	my main problem is that i try to configure resolution from ubuntu from an app in "system" tab, and it just makes my screen go weird
2008-03-06T20:35:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	db92	Is this a desktop or laptop
2008-03-06T20:36:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	db92	 HAve you gone to system admin restricted drivers manager?
2008-03-06T20:37:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	db92	The way to get that back.. is to use recovery mode.. sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg  select vesa as your card type and 1024 max, that will give you basic gui functions to continue unless something else has happened.
2008-03-06T20:38:00.000Z	db92	Jack_Sparrow	i should launch recovery mode and do that?
2008-03-06T20:38:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	db92	Please also note.. avoid scripts like automatix and to alesser extent envy
2008-03-06T20:39:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	db92	are you in desktop now
2008-03-06T20:41:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	db92	Sorry, yes, use recovery mode and try that command, use tab to bypass any other options  or just hit enter as needed, try not to change anything else for now..
2008-03-06T20:42:00.000Z	db92	Jack_Sparrow	k gonna try
2008-07-20T18:30:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	db92	What type of scripts are you planning on editing.
2008-07-20T18:31:00.000Z	db92	Jack_Sparrow	i thought it was obvious since i said devcpp, c/c++ code
2008-07-20T18:31:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	db92	I am quite busy.  I didnt catch that.
2008-07-20T18:32:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	db92	gedit highlights bash and py scripts
2008-07-23T17:49:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	db92	PLease go there if you cant stay on topic and keep it civil
