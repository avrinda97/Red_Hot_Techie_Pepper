2007-07-19T09:34:00.000Z	juno		hi i have a problem with Beryl Manager
2007-07-19T09:34:00.000Z	juno		it freezes my system
2007-07-19T09:35:00.000Z	juno		7.04 ubuntu
2007-07-19T09:35:00.000Z	catskul	juno	Beryl is still not quite stable
2007-07-19T09:35:00.000Z	catskul		 : (
2007-07-19T09:36:00.000Z	juno		i know but it worked just fine before...
2007-07-19T09:36:00.000Z	juno		and do you know how can i "reset" it settings?
2007-07-19T09:36:00.000Z	juno		i think i messed them :)
2007-07-19T09:37:00.000Z	catskul	juno	did you do things via menus or command line ?
2007-07-19T09:37:00.000Z	juno		menus
2007-07-19T09:37:00.000Z	juno		it freezes on start
2007-07-19T09:37:00.000Z	juno		i think i forced not nvodoa but other option..
2007-07-19T09:38:00.000Z	juno	catskul	any ideas?
2007-07-19T09:39:00.000Z	catskul	juno	i believe on 7.04 there is a system menu item which is something to the effect of "turn on/off desktop effects"
2007-07-19T09:39:00.000Z	catskul		Id try there
2007-07-19T09:42:00.000Z	juno	catskul	the problem occures only when i open the "Beryl Manager"
2007-07-19T09:42:00.000Z	juno		no freezes with "Beryl Settings Manager
2007-07-19T09:43:00.000Z	catskul	juno	Im not sure... I was suggesting that you turn off desktop effects. If you want to keep them and try to debug you might try starting beryl-manager from the command line and see if there are any debug/error messages
