2011-01-01T05:28:00.000Z	Musigreg	yayoj1	I try to mount it with right click and then "mount", and the thing is, I can mount it on a windows machine
2011-01-01T05:32:00.000Z	Musigreg	yayoj1	I tried every mount applications I found, and they told me the same thing.
2011-01-01T05:34:00.000Z	Musigreg	yayoj1	is there a way for me to know which iso format is it? Cos all I've read was that it wasn't one particular format. But nothing tells me what it is...
