2005-10-18T16:27:00.000Z	brownie17	C-Keen	no, GRUB. i installed windows and it works, but it dominates the MBR, now i want to put grub back on. there is a guide at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RecoveringUbuntuAfterInstallingWindows but i am having trouble following it
2005-10-18T16:27:00.000Z	C-Keen	brownie17	boot from CD, use the cd's grub to boot from disk, then do the grub-install thing
2005-10-18T16:28:00.000Z	C-Keen	brownie17	not live cd...boot your installed linux
2005-10-18T16:28:00.000Z	brownie17	C-Keen	don't know how
2005-10-18T16:28:00.000Z	C-Keen	brownie17	it will tell you at boot up...
2005-10-18T16:29:00.000Z	C-Keen	brownie17	or alternatively mount your hard disk. go in that directory. do a sudo chroot .
2005-10-18T16:29:00.000Z	C-Keen	brownie17	and the runt grub-install
2005-10-18T16:30:00.000Z	brownie17	C-Keen	NotHere intelikey three people telling me what to do, i am geting really confused, can someone PM me?
