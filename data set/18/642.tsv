2011-11-16T18:16:00.000Z	gnomerlocker		Why isn't my Firefox updating on Ubuntu 11.10? Does anyone have a similar problem?
2011-11-16T18:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gnomerlocker	which version are you on and which release?
2011-11-16T18:21:00.000Z	gnomerlocker	ActionParsnip	W: Failed to fetch http://ppa.launchpad.net/mozillateam/firefox-stable/ubuntu/dists/oneiric/main/source/Sources  404  Not Found
2011-11-16T18:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gnomerlocker	seems the stable PPA doesn't support oneiric, or natty
2011-11-16T18:22:00.000Z	gnomerlocker	ActionParsnip	So, what should I do?
2011-11-16T18:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gnomerlocker	sudo apt-get install ppa-purge; sudo ppa-purge ppa:mozillateam/firefox-stable; sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-mozilla-security/ppa; sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get upgrade
2011-11-16T18:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gnomerlocker	the PPA has ver 8
2011-11-16T18:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gnomerlocker	for Oneiric and Natty
2011-11-16T18:27:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gnomerlocker	you can get ver 11 from the daily build ppa if you are feeling brave
2011-11-16T18:28:00.000Z	gnomerlocker	ActionParsnip	Thanks. Works now.. Not up for 11 though. :P
2011-11-16T18:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gnomerlocker	sweet, not tried 11 myself, but I don't use firefox
2011-11-16T18:30:00.000Z	gnomerlocker	ActionParsnip	Me neither, but it should bring some new features (http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2011/11/firefox-11-alpha-to-land-december-20th-will-bring-speed-dial-chrome-migration/)
2011-11-16T18:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gnomerlocker	you can install speed dial as an addon
2011-11-16T18:30:00.000Z	gnomerlocker	ActionParsnip	Really?
2011-11-16T18:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gnomerlocker	https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/speed-dial/    Opera has had speed dial for AGES
2011-11-16T18:32:00.000Z	gnomerlocker	ActionParsnip	Yeah, I know about Opero. Had no idea you could have that in Firefox as well :P
2011-11-16T18:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gnomerlocker	Chrome has speed dial 2 which has a real nice text based export/import feature
2011-11-16T18:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	gnomerlocker	opera had speed dial in 2007 :)
