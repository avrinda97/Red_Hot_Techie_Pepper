2012-06-06T22:34:00.000Z	alanis		it was not locked when I rebooted but then it said to do this E: dpkg was interrupted, you must manually run 'sudo dpkg --configure -a' to correct the problem.
2012-06-06T22:34:00.000Z	alanis		then I did that and the other error started to appear
2012-06-06T22:35:00.000Z	alanis		terminal
2012-06-06T22:35:00.000Z	alanis		How can I kill the process blocking the updates
2012-06-06T22:36:00.000Z	B0g4r7	alanis	I suppose you can use 'sudi lsof', and grep that list to see what, if anything, has that open.
2012-06-06T22:36:00.000Z	B0g4r7		sudo I mean
2012-06-06T22:37:00.000Z	alanis	B0g4r7	I'm new to this, what is Grep
2012-06-06T22:37:00.000Z	B0g4r7		It just filters output to look for a specific string.  run 'man grep' if you're interested in details.
2012-06-06T22:38:00.000Z	alanis	B0g4r7	ok I just got a huge list
2012-06-06T22:38:00.000Z	B0g4r7		Yeah, so you'll wanna look through that list for /var/lib/dpkg
2012-06-06T22:39:00.000Z	B0g4r7		you can 'sudo lsof | grep dpkg' to pare it down some
2012-06-06T22:40:00.000Z	alanis	B0g4r7	I got this msg lsof: WARNING: can't stat() fuse.gvfs-fuse-daemon file system /home/alanis/.gvfs
