2006-03-17T11:56:00.000Z	carlk	RemyLaptop	yer welcome
2006-03-17T11:58:00.000Z	RemyLaptop	carlk	do you know how I can check what port it is on ?
2006-03-17T12:02:00.000Z	carlk	RemyLaptop	no clue - http://idoru.world.co.uk/sba/  <-shocking dmca crud about mp3 player drivers
2006-03-17T12:09:00.000Z	carlk	RemyLaptop	have you tried it with the default ?
2006-03-17T12:09:00.000Z	RemyLaptop	carlk	yup
2006-03-17T12:10:00.000Z	carlk	RemyLaptop	on fdisk - sudo fdisk -l
2006-03-17T12:17:00.000Z	carlk	RemyLaptop	Toma-, is there anything that says it should look like a drive?
2006-03-17T12:19:00.000Z	RemyLaptop	carlk	dunno
2006-03-17T12:19:00.000Z	RemyLaptop	carlk	the software says it might need a different port than the default, but I can't find what port it's assigned to.
2006-03-17T12:20:00.000Z	carlk	RemyLaptop	looks like the port is fine: "USB Rio found at address 3"
2006-03-17T12:22:00.000Z	RemyLaptop	carlk	the software for it expects the address to be a hex address
2006-03-17T12:24:00.000Z	carlk	RemyLaptop	but "USB Rio found at address 3" - I don't thnk it would print that if it wasn't the right address
2006-03-17T12:24:00.000Z	RemyLaptop	carlk	that address doesn't tell me anything though...
2006-03-17T12:26:00.000Z	carlk	RemyLaptop	im saying you don't need to know anything about the address
2006-03-17T12:26:00.000Z	carlk	RemyLaptop	but thats just a guess
