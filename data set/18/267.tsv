2012-05-16T22:44:00.000Z	phunyguy	kkrauss	sorry, not really...
2012-05-16T22:31:00.000Z	phunyguy	kkrauss	virtualbox
2012-05-16T22:31:00.000Z	kkrauss	phunyguy	ok whats your reasoning?
2012-05-16T22:32:00.000Z	phunyguy	kkrauss	performance, and ease of setup.
2012-05-16T22:32:00.000Z	kkrauss	phunyguy	xen was really easy too, but I cant speak on performance
2012-05-16T22:32:00.000Z	kkrauss	phunyguy	what I want to do is I have an older system I want to turn into a server, I want web server, possibly a file server, maybe dns etc
2012-05-16T22:33:00.000Z	kkrauss	phunyguy	should I still use debian squeeze?
2012-05-16T22:33:00.000Z	phunyguy	kkrauss	i wouldnt
2012-05-16T22:34:00.000Z	kkrauss	phunyguy	what do you recommend?
2012-05-16T22:34:00.000Z	kkrauss	phunyguy	I do not know what you mean by headless route
2012-05-16T22:34:00.000Z	phunyguy	kkrauss	text based install with no monitor, and ssh access to the box
2012-05-16T22:34:00.000Z	kkrauss	phunyguy	eventually yes, I will sipmly ssh in
2012-05-16T22:37:00.000Z	kkrauss	phunyguy	ok back, I am getting different opinions here.  the most common is to use debian squeeze with xen because its easy to set up(I also already know how to do it) and it stays out of your way as my professor quoted, but ou are the second person to say use ubuntu server
2012-05-16T22:38:00.000Z	phunyguy	kkrauss	its my opinion
2012-05-16T22:38:00.000Z	kkrauss	phunyguy	ok well ignoring xen for a moment, what about squeeze vs ubuntu server?
2012-05-16T22:41:00.000Z	phunyguy	kkrauss	never used squeeze
2012-05-16T22:44:00.000Z	kkrauss	phunyguy	you wouldn't happen to be familiar with how to do a network install would you?  This older machine I have doesnt support usb booting so was wondering if I could some how boot it off my laptop and install from there?
2012-05-16T22:45:00.000Z	phunyguy	kkrauss	maybe you can attach the HDD to the laptop somehow, and install that way, then just plug the drive into the server
