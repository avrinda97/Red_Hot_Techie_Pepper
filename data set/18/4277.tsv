2009-05-06T11:51:00.000Z	Kartagis		how is the screen resolution set in 9.04?
2009-05-06T11:52:00.000Z	sonali	Kartagis	System->Preferences->Screen Resolution
2009-05-06T11:52:00.000Z	Kartagis	sonali	it's net there anymore
2009-05-06T11:53:00.000Z	sonali	Kartagis	that is weird....
2009-05-06T11:53:00.000Z	sonali	Kartagis	ohh I pity you
2009-05-06T11:58:00.000Z	sonali	Kartagis	if you want to reset xorg settings you could try resetting them
2009-05-06T11:59:00.000Z	sonali	Kartagis	simply delete your xorg.conf file and reboot
2009-05-06T11:59:00.000Z	sonali	Kartagis	a new one will be created
2009-05-06T11:59:00.000Z	Kartagis	sonali	I'll try that
2009-05-06T11:59:00.000Z	sonali	Kartagis	if your using some graphics card and proprietary drivers, you should try reseting xorg settings with them
2009-05-06T12:00:00.000Z	sonali	Kartagis	like nvidia-settings command
2009-05-06T12:00:00.000Z	sonali	Kartagis	I don't remember the exact command check it out
2009-05-06T12:00:00.000Z	sonali	Kartagis	it depends on your installation, xorg drivers
2009-05-06T12:00:00.000Z	Kartagis	sonali	no, my display card if o/b
2009-05-06T12:01:00.000Z	sonali	Kartagis	hey instead of removing xorg.conf rename it to xorg.conf.backup
2009-05-06T12:01:00.000Z	Kartagis	sonali	I'll try that
2009-05-06T12:02:00.000Z	sonali	Kartagis	ok, if that doesn't help you a lot, you will have to look deeper into manyally patching xorg.conf file as Severian suggested
