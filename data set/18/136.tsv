2012-08-12T04:32:00.000Z	Cromat		I never could get use to fedora
2012-08-12T04:33:00.000Z	triad	Cromat	what's so different ?
2012-08-12T04:33:00.000Z	triad		i like fedora because it gets installed very easy with XFCE
2012-08-12T04:33:00.000Z	triad		gnome crashes at me i think
2012-08-12T04:33:00.000Z	triad		in fact, i never tested on this netbook
2012-08-12T04:33:00.000Z	triad		i think i might definitly move to ubuntu
2012-08-12T04:33:00.000Z	Cromat	triad	Not sure, I don't know rpm really and it just felt uncomfortable.  Might have to give it another try but in the past I had nothing but hardware problems
2012-08-12T04:34:00.000Z	Cromat		tried: Most likely just bad luck on my part
2012-08-12T04:34:00.000Z	triad	Cromat	hm..
2012-08-12T04:34:00.000Z	triad		don't know what to say
2012-08-12T04:34:00.000Z	Cromat		tried: I'll give it another go now
2012-08-12T04:34:00.000Z	Cromat		been wanting to do a nothing install on empty drive
2012-08-12T04:34:00.000Z	triad		i'll check on youtube to see how it works ubuntu on my netbook :)
2012-08-12T04:35:00.000Z	Cromat	triad	Plus the ubuntu community has been more help especially for my Asus Zenbook...
2012-08-12T04:36:00.000Z	Cromat		lol -- tried: The requested URL /pub/linux/fedora/releases/17/Live/x86_64/Fedora-17-x86_64-Live-Desktop.iso was not found on this server

2012-08-12T04:36:00.000Z	triad		fedora doesn't want you
2012-08-12T04:36:00.000Z	Cromat	triad	see bad luck :)
