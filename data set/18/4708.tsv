2009-02-28T00:37:00.000Z	zimbres		I'm having lots of problems because some environment variables are not defined by default, where could I find a file containing some definitions?
2009-02-28T00:38:00.000Z	uptill3	zimbres	what kind of defintions?
2009-02-28T00:38:00.000Z	uptill3	zimbres	of your environment variables?
2009-02-28T00:42:00.000Z	zimbres	uptill3	yes, some executables are not finding shared libraries and headers, how to solve this?
2009-02-28T00:43:00.000Z	uptill3	zimbres	check out ldconfig
2009-02-28T00:55:00.000Z	zimbres	uptill3	For example the executable is not finding "iostream" and Rtypes.h(that is in /usr/local/include/root/Rtypes.h).
2009-02-28T00:56:00.000Z	uptill3	zimbres	/usr/local/include/root* isn't going to be in your path unelss you add it?
2009-02-28T00:59:00.000Z	zimbres	uptill3	But what is the environment variable? I thought the include directory in /usr/local was included automaticaly.
2009-02-28T00:59:00.000Z	uptill3	zimbres	are yout rying to compile software?
2009-02-28T01:00:00.000Z	uptill3	zimbres	/usr/local/include is included in the library search path by default
2009-02-28T01:00:00.000Z	uptill3	zimbres	but /usr/local/include/root isn't
2009-02-28T01:00:00.000Z	uptill3	zimbres	you'd have to include root/filename
2009-02-28T01:00:00.000Z	uptill3	zimbres	instead of just filename
2009-02-28T01:01:00.000Z	zimbres	uptill3	How do I include this path?
2009-02-28T01:04:00.000Z	uptill3	zimbres	depends on what you are using to compile?
2009-02-28T01:07:00.000Z	zimbres	uptill3	I thought it would look recursively in /usr/local/include and /usr/local/lib etc. I some other directories in /usr/local/lib/root/... . I am using ./configure make and make install, it compiles ok, and install ok, but when I run the executable generated in /usr/local/bin it does not find some files as I said.
2009-02-28T01:08:00.000Z	uptill3	zimbres	I dont think it looks recursively? I think you have to give it a relative path
2009-02-28T01:09:00.000Z	zimbres	uptill3	how do I give the path name, in the configure script?
