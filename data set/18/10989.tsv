2007-12-21T01:27:00.000Z	luca	PirateHead	give me the time to write it ;)
2007-12-21T01:28:00.000Z	PirateHead	luca	I had that problem and it turned out that my wireless switch was turned off. Have you checked for the silly stuff like that?
2007-12-21T01:31:00.000Z	luca	PirateHead	the switch is on
2007-12-21T01:32:00.000Z	luca	PirateHead	the problem is not there :)
2007-12-21T01:32:00.000Z	PirateHead	luca	If you reboot into a LiveCD, does the wireless work?
2007-12-21T01:33:00.000Z	luca	PirateHead	yeah
2007-12-21T01:33:00.000Z	luca	PirateHead	that's the strange part
2007-12-21T01:33:00.000Z	PirateHead	luca	That means it's a software problem, then.
2007-12-21T01:34:00.000Z	luca	PirateHead	ok well how to solve or hack or patch it?
2007-12-21T01:34:00.000Z	PirateHead	luca	I'm not great with wireless cards myself, but I can suggest general ideas such as reinstalling the drivers and checking dmsg to see if there's some wireless-related debug output.
2007-12-21T01:35:00.000Z	luca	PirateHead	well that's the point...I have to use the windows drivers while in the hd installed os. And they do not function. The live cd has not those drivers...yet wireless functions.
2007-12-21T01:37:00.000Z	PirateHead	luca	perhaps the Windows drivers aren't really needed?
2007-12-21T01:38:00.000Z	luca	PirateHead	maybe yes!
2007-12-21T01:38:00.000Z	luca	PirateHead	in fact I have just found out that linux-wlan-ng-firmware might solve the problem
2007-12-21T01:39:00.000Z	PirateHead	luca	I hope so. Good luck with that.
2007-12-21T01:39:00.000Z	luca	PirateHead	thanks I will tell you if it functions :)
