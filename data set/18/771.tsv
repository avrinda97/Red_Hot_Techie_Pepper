2011-09-18T00:44:00.000Z	djbox		Is there anyway i can simplified to uninstall all the fresh install ubuntu bloatware with command??
2011-09-18T00:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	djbox	how do you mean?
2011-09-18T00:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	djbox	do you mean uninstall a recently installed app?
2011-09-18T00:48:00.000Z	djbox	ActionParsnip	both . You know when you recently install a fresh ubuntu and it contains those games
2011-09-18T00:48:00.000Z	djbox	ActionParsnip	and trying out those games out
2011-09-18T00:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	djbox	I'm familiar, if you run: sudo apt-get --purge remove aislerot gbrainy gnomine gnome-mahjong   it should work
2011-09-18T00:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	djbox	you get the idea, personally I use the minimal install and work up as a default ubuntu desktop has far too much fluff which I simply don't use. Takes me longer to gut it than to build up
2011-09-18T00:52:00.000Z	djbox	ActionParsnip	 what os your using right now?
2011-09-18T00:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	djbox	oneiric I use mainly LXDE but switch to Gnome+Unity so I can support it
2011-09-18T00:54:00.000Z	djbox	ActionParsnip	so far found out the games are located /usr/games contains the game name
2011-09-18T00:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	djbox	they are all part of packages, just remove the package and it will remove
2011-09-18T00:58:00.000Z	djbox	ActionParsnip	I'm not sure if i'm doing this correctly. Is it sudo apt-get --purge remove  ___________
2011-09-18T00:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	djbox	gbrainy gnome-mahjong gnomine aislerot qudrapassel
2011-09-18T00:59:00.000Z	djbox	ActionParsnip	how did you get that whole list of name so quick
2011-09-18T01:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	djbox	I typed it
2011-09-18T01:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	djbox	I used my head I guess
2011-09-18T01:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	djbox	some of the spelling may be off but you can tab complete stuff
2011-09-18T01:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	djbox	sudo apt-get install openssh-server
