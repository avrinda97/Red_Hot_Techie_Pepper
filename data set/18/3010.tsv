2010-01-04T05:05:00.000Z	jcc1	kwtm	repeat the question, I missed it
2010-01-04T05:06:00.000Z	kwtm	jcc1	FactTech: Hi.  When I use "apt-cache search", I have to do some sort of index command before hand, right?  What was that command?  "apt-cache update" or something?
2010-01-04T05:06:00.000Z	jcc1	kwtm	apt-get update
2010-01-04T05:07:00.000Z	jcc1	kwtm	the packages themselves won't be there until you download them, just locations, versions, etc
2010-01-04T05:08:00.000Z	kwtm	jcc1	Agreed that apt-cache won't download packages, but at least I should be able to locate a package name.
2010-01-04T05:08:00.000Z	jcc1	kwtm	Have you tried to use Synaptic Package Manager yet?
2010-01-04T05:09:00.000Z	jcc1	kwtm	that will update for you and give you various search options from a GUI
2010-01-04T05:09:00.000Z	kwtm	jcc1	I'll try.  There are other packages that seem to be missing.  Anyway, for some reason Synaptic (and Compiz) have teensy font sizes (size 7) that I can't read.
2010-01-04T05:09:00.000Z	jcc1	kwtm	I don't use Compiz so I cannot help you there
2010-01-04T05:09:00.000Z	kwtm	jcc1	(separate issue now --I have *lots* of problems with Ubuntu) I can't read the fonts so I have to use the command-line instead.
2010-01-04T05:10:00.000Z	jcc1	kwtm	Compiz has always been a pain the few times I tried it, so I always dumped it, I'm not big on eye candy anyway :-)
2010-01-04T05:11:00.000Z	kwtm	jcc1	I need it for the magnifier function, so I can read the screen properly.
2010-01-04T05:11:00.000Z	jcc1	kwtm	If it were me, I would just dump Compiz
2010-01-04T05:12:00.000Z	jcc1	kwtm	just eye candy anyway
2010-01-04T05:49:00.000Z	kwtm	jcc1	What screen magnifier would you recommend if not the one in Compiz, that would work with Kubuntu (KDE3)?  I tried KMag but it takes too much clicking.  I want one that appears when I need it and disappears when I don't need it.

2010-01-04T06:05:00.000Z	jcc1	kwtm	sorry, I was on the phone... I rarely use 'em so I don't have a good anser
