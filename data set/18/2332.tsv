2010-06-19T06:45:00.000Z	Shapeshiftr		ok, so I registered my domain name with GoDaddy.com, and they gave me an IP address for my site, which they got from a DNS server, Areport

2010-06-19T06:47:00.000Z	Shapeshiftr		another guy asked me what my question was, I'm just reading it now
2010-06-19T06:49:00.000Z	Shapeshiftr		I'm just wondering how I can set up my system to recognize my registered domain name that came with a DNS-provided IP
2010-06-19T06:49:00.000Z	Shapeshiftr		1 sec, reading a page
2010-06-19T06:51:00.000Z	Shapeshiftr		ubuntu is debian-based, correct?
2010-06-19T06:53:00.000Z	Shapeshiftr		so, yeah, I do want to edit /etc/hosts
2010-06-19T06:53:00.000Z	Shapeshiftr		that's what I though
2010-06-19T06:53:00.000Z	Shapeshiftr		*t
2010-06-19T06:53:00.000Z	Shapeshiftr		right now, my hosts file says-
2010-06-19T06:54:00.000Z	Khisanth	Shapeshiftr	that wouldn't really help if you want other people to be able to access your site
2010-06-19T07:05:00.000Z	Khisanth	Shapeshiftr	if apache is already running on the server with that ip then there is no need to change anything
2010-06-19T07:09:00.000Z	Khisanth	Shapeshiftr	what is the address you are trying to set up?
2010-06-19T07:13:00.000Z	Shapeshiftr	Khisanth	but, for example, the other line is just --
2010-06-19T07:13:00.000Z	Khisanth	Shapeshiftr	that is fine
2010-06-19T07:14:00.000Z	Shapeshiftr	Khisanth	thanks. though it's confusing, all the tutorials i've seen for setting up a server show the second format
2010-06-19T07:14:00.000Z	Khisanth	Shapeshiftr	do you know what /etc/hosts is for? :)
2010-06-19T07:19:00.000Z	Khisanth	Shapeshiftr	no but that would be ideal
