2011-02-15T16:00:00.000Z	yourwhiteshadow	kingofthething	what's up?
2011-02-15T16:02:00.000Z	yourwhiteshadow	kingofthething	yeah it happened to me the other day, it partitions, but doesn't format, just format it to exf4
2011-02-15T16:03:00.000Z	yourwhiteshadow	kingofthething	so you have to go to the advanced partitioner, and select the partition, it won't be formatted, so you have to choose a format, and then choose the boot directory, which should just be "/"
2011-02-15T16:05:00.000Z	yourwhiteshadow	kingofthething	can you click on the partition that you created, and choose a format
2011-02-15T16:06:00.000Z	yourwhiteshadow	kingofthething	why do you want to get rid of the partition now?
2011-02-15T16:06:00.000Z	yourwhiteshadow	kingofthething	you can...i'm telling you, this happened to me, i already know how to use the partition
2011-02-15T16:08:00.000Z	yourwhiteshadow	kingofthething	do you remember seeing advanced partition during the install?
2011-02-15T16:08:00.000Z	yourwhiteshadow	kingofthething	you need to go into the advanced partition, and tell me what you see
2011-02-15T16:08:00.000Z	yourwhiteshadow	kingofthething	also, i assume you're using 1 hdd?
2011-02-15T16:10:00.000Z	yourwhiteshadow	kingofthething	ok, lemme do a rundown for you then
2011-02-15T16:13:00.000Z	yourwhiteshadow	kingofthething	so basically for some reason the installer creates a partition, but it doesn't format it, so you need to get into the advanced partition in the installer, and then (right ?) click on your partition, you'll get an option to pick a format for it, i chose exfat4 (or exf4 or something), and then you have to choose a root directory, there are a bunch of options in the dropdown, choose "/" w/o the "", it'll format the pa
2011-02-15T16:14:00.000Z	yourwhiteshadow	kingofthething	Ext4 journaling file system for "Use as:" and for "Mount point:" "/"
2011-02-15T16:15:00.000Z	yourwhiteshadow	kingofthething	for "primary" and "beginning" for the other options
2011-02-15T16:18:00.000Z	yourwhiteshadow	kingofthething	after that ubuntu will install into that partition, dual booting is taken care of because when your computer restarts after the installation there will be a bootloader GRUB 2 that allows you to choose between Ubuntu/Win7/whatever other OS
2011-02-15T16:20:00.000Z	yourwhiteshadow	kingofthething	good luck, i'm gonna head to bed, but i'll still be on, feel free to PM me, hopefully you'll be on ubuntu, GL, and please message me if it worked too, makes me feel good that i could help
2011-02-15T16:37:00.000Z	kingofthething	yourwhiteshadow	the installer crashed again...
2011-02-15T16:39:00.000Z	kingofthething	yourwhiteshadow	thoughts on what i should do...?
