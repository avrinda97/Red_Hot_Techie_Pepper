2011-07-17T23:49:00.000Z	KM0201	Taffflash	did you install ubuntu, or are you asking how to install ubuntu?
2011-07-17T23:47:00.000Z	KM0201	Taffflash	well, what does lsb_release -a
2011-07-17T23:50:00.000Z	KM0201	Taffflash	opena  terminal (application/accessories/terminal) and type "lsb_release -a" no quotes, and hit enter.. make sure there's a space after release
2011-07-17T23:51:00.000Z	KM0201	Taffflash	ok, thats the current long term support,  you can either upgrade 10.04 to 10.10, then upgrade 10.10 to 11.04, or clean install 11.04 (thats what i would do)
2011-07-17T23:53:00.000Z	KM0201	Taffflash	ok, just pay attention, and make sure you install 11.04 OVER 10.04, rather than beside it.
2011-07-17T23:53:00.000Z	KM0201	Taffflash	well why wouldn't it be OK?
2011-07-17T23:53:00.000Z	KM0201	Taffflash	yes,
2011-07-17T23:54:00.000Z	KM0201	Taffflash	np, good luck
