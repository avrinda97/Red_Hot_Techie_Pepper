2007-06-30T06:36:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp		I think my pc's BIOS is detecting 1gb of ram, but ubuntu is only detecting 512 - I have just upgraded from a single stick of 256 to two sticks of 512.  Why would this happen? I've tried both sticks in several combos, but only 512 ever gets recognised.
2007-06-30T06:37:00.000Z	ponicg	Lunar_Lamp	only by ubuntu or also by the bios?
2007-06-30T06:37:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp	ponicg	the BIOS detects 1gb
2007-06-30T06:37:00.000Z	ponicg	Lunar_Lamp	What video card do you have?
2007-06-30T06:38:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp	ponicg	what's that got to do with it? Radeon 9200 I think.
2007-06-30T06:38:00.000Z	ponicg	Lunar_Lamp	Hmm - it's not onboard is it? cause it might be doing shared memory...
2007-06-30T06:39:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp	ponicg	gah, yes, it is onboard, completly forgot I didn't put the 9200 in yet - but sharing 512mb?! Why?
2007-06-30T06:39:00.000Z	ponicg	Lunar_Lamp	Because it's stupid, likely:)
2007-06-30T06:40:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp	ponicg	lol, ok, I'll try with a gfx card in - hope this works :-)
2007-06-30T06:40:00.000Z	ponicg	Lunar_Lamp	if not come back we'll get it fixed:)
2007-06-30T06:44:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp	ponicg	nope - wasn't due to shared - with gfx card in still only 512 detected
2007-06-30T06:45:00.000Z	ponicg	Lunar_Lamp	hmm. bios sees 512 or 1gb?
2007-06-30T06:47:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp	ponicg	memtest done by bios shows ~1024mb ok
2007-06-30T06:47:00.000Z	ponicg	Lunar_Lamp	that's odd.
2007-06-30T06:48:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp	ponicg	getting it to run a proper memtest in a minute
2007-06-30T06:49:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp	ponicg	memtest86 detects 1gb of fram, but ubuntu doesn't - is it perhaps a kernel issue? 512mb max of ram compiled in somehow?
2007-06-30T06:50:00.000Z	ponicg	Lunar_Lamp	that's beyond my knowldge. sorry
2007-06-30T06:52:00.000Z	Lunar_Lamp	ponicg	ok, magically, it's got 1gb somehow now - no idea how, but I'm happy.
