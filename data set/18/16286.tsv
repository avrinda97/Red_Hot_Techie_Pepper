2004-10-21T16:56:00.000Z	AndersAA	neighborlee	you need to mount it first..
2004-10-21T16:57:00.000Z	AndersAA	neighborlee	mount /dev/hdb2 /mnt && chroot /mnt /bin/bash
2004-10-21T16:57:00.000Z	neighborlee	AndersAA	oh ic...sigh ok thx
2004-10-21T05:06:00.000Z	neighborlee	AndersAA	no luck..mount can't find /dev/hdbx
2004-10-21T05:08:00.000Z	neighborlee	AndersAA	I was also getting error about mount problem since /dev/hdb2 wasn't in fstab ....
2004-10-21T05:11:00.000Z	neighborlee	AndersAA	problem is I have zero access to linux period..
2004-10-21T05:12:00.000Z	neighborlee	AndersAA	yes..before I installed XP again though
2004-10-21T05:16:00.000Z	neighborlee	AndersAA	I hope after this that ubuntu adds a 'rescue' mode ;(...this aint cuttin in at all
2004-10-21T05:16:00.000Z	neighborlee	AndersAA	i'm looking to lose data im' not sure I have ;(....Ican't get back in to verify what I have ;(
2004-10-21T05:17:00.000Z	AndersAA	neighborlee	what you could do that might work, is boot the install cd's install program, then go through the menu until you can find your hd, and after that quit the install program, it should have loaded your modules
2004-10-21T05:20:00.000Z	neighborlee	AndersAA	yeah it loads my modules alright..but since hdb2 isn't in /dev then mount can't do what it needs to do...i've no idea how other distros do this but thats where I find myself..IF I could have found 'mkbootdisk' or whatever debian calls it..i'd be FINE now ;(boohisssigh ..ha <<
2004-10-21T05:20:00.000Z	AndersAA	neighborlee	hmm, report that as a bug, it should have those there
2004-10-21T05:20:00.000Z	AndersAA	neighborlee	you realize you can boot from any other distro's cd and run grub from there right? ;)
2004-10-21T05:22:00.000Z	neighborlee	AndersAA	ok will do
2004-10-21T05:22:00.000Z	neighborlee	AndersAA	hmmm
2004-10-21T05:23:00.000Z	neighborlee	AndersAA	well I do have knoppix ( although I realize ubuntu has a new LIVECD which is nice!) I guess I could use it..but how does grub find my current installed patition ( what is syntax ?)
2004-10-21T05:24:00.000Z	AndersAA	neighborlee	grub (to start it, will take a few seconds); root (hd1,0) #that'll be hdb1; ; setup (hd0)
2004-10-21T05:27:00.000Z	neighborlee	AndersAA	sigh i'm not as familiar with grub as I could be..what does the setup part do ?
