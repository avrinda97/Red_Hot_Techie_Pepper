2011-02-04T10:16:00.000Z	digirak	bazhang	hey can u help me with a gcc issue
2011-02-04T10:16:00.000Z	bazhang	digirak	with what exactly please explain
2011-02-04T10:17:00.000Z	digirak	bazhang	ok ... my cmakekde compiler tells me that the gcc link is broken
2011-02-04T10:18:00.000Z	bazhang	digirak	you are compiling kde4?
2011-02-04T10:18:00.000Z	digirak	bazhang	it seems that that gcc doesnt exist but is linking to gcc-4.4
2011-02-04T10:18:00.000Z	digirak	bazhang	no but i am build the kde build environment
2011-02-04T10:18:00.000Z	bazhang	digirak	explain exactly what you are trying to achieve please
2011-02-04T10:19:00.000Z	digirak	bazhang	i am trying to build dependencies for kde
2011-02-04T10:19:00.000Z	bazhang	digirak	why? they are in the repos, handled by the package manager
2011-02-04T10:20:00.000Z	digirak	bazhang	no thats not how i want to do it, because i want to make sure i have all the packages where i want them. so that i dont get into problems when actually using the build environment
2011-02-04T10:20:00.000Z	bazhang	digirak	you could try #kde I suppose
2011-02-04T10:21:00.000Z	digirak	bazhang	i thought this seems more like an ubuntu issue
2011-02-04T10:21:00.000Z	bazhang	digirak	ubuntu uses gnome, kubuntu uses kde4, both use the package manager to handle dependencies
2011-02-04T10:23:00.000Z	digirak	bazhang	the error this gives is that of a broken compiler
2011-02-04T10:23:00.000Z	bazhang	digirak	its not the supported method of installing dependencies. you can ask in #kde
