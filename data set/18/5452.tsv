2008-11-04T22:30:00.000Z	billybigrigger		what is the best firefox/flash plugin available? should i manually download from adobe.com or what? i think in 8.04 i remember flash playing really slow so i think i installed the wrong one, like firefox gives me 3 choices, adobe, gnash and cant remember the other one, or is it best to manually install? or apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree??? help im lost...too many options
2008-11-04T22:31:00.000Z	`TonY	billybigrigger	gnash swfdec flashplugin-nonfree
2008-11-04T22:32:00.000Z	`TonY	billybigrigger	 MaT-dg is correct, since all flash made movies on the internet are made by a native application to nonfree's one
