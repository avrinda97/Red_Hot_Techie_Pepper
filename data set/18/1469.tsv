2011-02-09T11:15:00.000Z	kf7nnz		No one can help me with my Evolution question?
2011-02-09T11:16:00.000Z	kf7nnz		I want to know why Evolution doesn't send mail immediately. I have to manually press the send/receive button.
2011-02-09T11:17:00.000Z	joc	kf7nnz	might want to check the account preferences...
2011-02-09T11:17:00.000Z	kf7nnz	joc	I looked through all of the options and doen't see one for send immediately. Unless I'm missing it?
2011-02-09T11:19:00.000Z	joc	kf7nnz	Did you see the "receiving options" tab?
2011-02-09T11:20:00.000Z	kf7nnz	joc	I don't see that tab. Where would I find it?
2011-02-09T11:22:00.000Z	joc	kf7nnz	edit->prefs->"edit your account"->"2nd tab"
2011-02-09T11:23:00.000Z	kf7nnz	joc	OK, I found it, what is it I should be checking on that tab?
2011-02-09T11:24:00.000Z	joc	kf7nnz	check for message every x minutes ? :-/
2011-02-09T11:25:00.000Z	kf7nnz	joc	It is set to check every 5 minutes.
2011-02-09T11:26:00.000Z	kf7nnz	joc	But I have had it keep messages until the next day when I notice they still have not sent. then I have to manually send/receive.
2011-02-09T11:27:00.000Z	joc	kf7nnz	Does it prompt your for your password when you send/recieve?
2011-02-09T11:28:00.000Z	kf7nnz	joc	no, and receiving happens automatically.
2011-02-09T11:32:00.000Z	joc	kf7nnz	Weird. So, it will never send automatically w/o first clicking snd/rec?
2011-02-09T11:33:00.000Z	kf7nnz	joc	that is correct! very strange! Evolution 2.30.2 on Ubuntu 10.10
2011-02-09T11:34:00.000Z	joc	kf7nnz	You're not in offline line mode any any chance?
2011-02-09T11:36:00.000Z	kf7nnz	joc	no, I did have that issue once - my network connection dropped after a RDP session hung. But even after I rebooted and the network was back, my mail still didn't send until I manually pressed send/receive
2011-02-09T11:40:00.000Z	joc	kf7nnz	My best guess would be to check your mail server's error log :-/. Maybe recreate the account. No idea.
