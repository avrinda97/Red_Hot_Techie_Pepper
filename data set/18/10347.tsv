2007-06-21T09:27:00.000Z	wols	n2diy_	get his broadcom 4318 working
2007-06-21T09:27:00.000Z	n2diy_	wols	cable modem?
2007-06-21T09:27:00.000Z	wols	n2diy_	do you know what a broadcom 4318 is?
2007-06-21T09:28:00.000Z	n2diy_	wols	a cable modem? :)
2007-06-21T09:28:00.000Z	wols	n2diy_	don't bother. broadcom 43xx are a widely known range of wlan cards
2007-06-21T09:29:00.000Z	n2diy_	wols	roger.
2007-06-21T09:55:00.000Z	wols	n2diy_	df -h only shows what's mounted. his problem is he cannot mount...
2007-06-21T09:56:00.000Z	n2diy_	wols	doesn't df do the same thing? maybe df -a is what he is after?
2007-06-21T09:57:00.000Z	wols	n2diy_	no. I told you: only mounted filesystems. his problem is it doesn't mount
2007-06-21T09:58:00.000Z	n2diy_	wols	ok, I must have got my threads crossed, I thought you told him to use df.
2007-06-21T10:32:00.000Z	n2diy_	wols	I think we are a little more tolerant around here, I understood the question.
2007-06-21T10:32:00.000Z	wols	n2diy_	I don't
2007-06-21T10:33:00.000Z	wols	n2diy_	and if you understund it, answer him
2007-06-21T10:34:00.000Z	n2diy_	wols	he wants the replies to his posts highlighted. gnome-chat does it for me, so I don't know how to help him?
2007-06-21T10:34:00.000Z	wols	n2diy_	me neither. he doesn't say what client he uses and I don't do mirc support here
2007-06-21T10:36:00.000Z	n2diy_	wols	roger that.
2012-10-23T04:13:00.000Z	wols	n2diy_	generally, there is no X configuration. do you have a xorg.conf file?
2012-10-23T04:14:00.000Z	n2diy_	wols	I have xorg.conf.d
