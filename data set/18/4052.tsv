2010-01-02T08:20:00.000Z	ctmjr	alain_	i do not know how you got in that state what did you do to try to  install it ubuntu kernel has v4l drivers built in
2010-01-02T08:21:00.000Z	alain_		i find web to explain it but it doesnt work
2010-01-02T08:22:00.000Z	alain_		i find this page http://www.crismonblog.org/langolo-del-geeko/pinnacle-pctv-usb-stick-70e-e-linux.html but i dont know what to do
2010-01-02T08:27:00.000Z	ctmjr	alain_	sorry i cannot read that so i do not know what it had you do besides install v4l drivers which are already there, you can try and unplug the stick and remove the modules and then plug the stick back in
2010-01-02T08:28:00.000Z	alain_		i dont know remove the modules
2010-01-02T08:31:00.000Z	ctmjr	alain_	run rmmod em28xx
2010-01-02T08:31:00.000Z	ctmjr	alain_	run sudo rmmod em28xx
2010-01-02T08:32:00.000Z	alain_	ctmjr	ERROR: Module em28xx does not exist in /proc/modules
2010-01-02T08:39:00.000Z	ctmjr	alain_	ok this is what i think happened ubuntu has drivers for v4l then you installed the v4l drivers from mercurial and messed it all up i do not know how to remove the drivers from mercurial
