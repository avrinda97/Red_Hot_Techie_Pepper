2011-10-26T09:24:00.000Z	pratz		hey guys now i am running 10.04 from 6-7 months and did not faced any problems, but now a days system is rebooting and shuting down slowly, can you suggest me some software like 'disk cleanup' or some thing similar, though i have not used such software in past
2011-10-26T09:26:00.000Z	evmunro	pratz	u can use the autoclean terminal command to start off get :'"sudo apt-get autoclean"
2011-10-26T09:28:00.000Z	pratz	evmunro	what does that program exactly do ?
2011-10-26T09:29:00.000Z	pratz	evmunro	but dude i have not installed many softwares by compiling them
2011-10-26T09:29:00.000Z	evmunro	pratz	it removes partial packages, and that kinda stuff. theres also a way to get rid of residual copnfig files
2011-10-26T09:31:00.000Z	pratz	evmunro	will that command even clean all the .deb packages in /var/cache/apt/archives ?
2011-10-26T09:31:00.000Z	evmunro	pratz	depends. I think it just cleans old and unneeded packages
2011-10-26T09:32:00.000Z	pratz	evmunro	because i have made that location my repo and for my other computers i install the softwares from there
2011-10-26T09:32:00.000Z	pratz	evmunro	so can i run autoclean program safely ?
2011-10-26T09:33:00.000Z	evmunro	pratz	You should be able to, although I would suggest doing a quick backup to a thumbdrive, just to be safe :D
2011-10-26T09:36:00.000Z	evmunro	pratz	to remove old config files (can take up quite a bit of space), open synaptic package manager, then go to the bottom left and click status. then click the "not installed(residual config)" option above it. Tick all the packages you see on the right and press apply.
2011-10-26T09:37:00.000Z	evmunro	pratz	to remove unnecessary locale data, you could also run "sudo apt-get install localepurge" this will remove any unused language files from anything installed
2011-10-26T09:39:00.000Z	evmunro	pratz	your computer shouldnt be that bad then, when did u get the computer, how full is the hdd, are you running compiz effects, do u have a graphics card?
2011-10-26T09:41:00.000Z	pratz	evmunro	no i do not run compiz effects and all the other graphics stuff, i just do not like them, most of the time i spend on terminal, that is the reason why i am worried
2011-10-26T09:42:00.000Z	evmunro	pratz	oh ok, then. that's quite strange....any background processes you forgot about?
2011-10-26T09:43:00.000Z	evmunro	pratz	although admittedly, they would have to be massive to make any big problems
2011-10-26T09:45:00.000Z	pratz	evmunro	background process would be apache , mysql ,ssh, smtp server and other general stuff
2011-10-26T09:46:00.000Z	evmunro	pratz	shouldnt be that bad................interesting.  I really don't know. when was the last time you turned it off?
