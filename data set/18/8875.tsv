2012-04-24T01:00:00.000Z	abdullahfaqeir		and the mouse pad has stoped suddnly
2012-04-24T01:00:00.000Z	abdullahfaqeir		ok
2012-04-24T01:01:00.000Z	bkc_	abdullahfaqeir	are u in graphics-mode (gnome, kde, whatnot) or in terminal-mode ?
2012-04-24T01:01:00.000Z	bkc_	abdullahfaqeir	is there anything but text on the screen?
2012-04-24T01:02:00.000Z	bkc_	abdullahfaqeir	if it's an ontopic-question please keep it in the channel as others might gain from the answer
2012-04-24T01:02:00.000Z	bkc_	abdullahfaqeir	"how would I know" => does it look like dos?
2012-04-24T01:03:00.000Z	bkc_	abdullahfaqeir	then the xserver probably just hung, try pressing CTRL+ALT+BACKSPACE :)
2012-04-24T01:06:00.000Z	bkc_	abdullahfaqeir	ctrl+alt+1 then
2012-04-24T01:06:00.000Z	bkc_	abdullahfaqeir	and then "sudo service gdm restart" (without the quotes)
2012-04-24T01:10:00.000Z	bkc_	abdullahfaqeir	restarting the desktop and still not working only proves that it wasn't hung :) there are still loads to try :P
2012-04-24T01:15:00.000Z	bkc_	abdullahfaqeir	seeing as my computer only hangs and the mouse actually works from scratch I can't really help you :( but I'd look into the xserver config-files to see if everything checksout okey, otherwise wait for someone else to help you :)
2012-04-24T01:16:00.000Z	bkc_	abdullahfaqeir	and please for the love of god, please stop with the pm's... unless otherwise stated or told, support-channels *hate* pm's as they are counterproductive to the "support"-idea -.-
