2007-05-17T16:27:00.000Z	Frem		Hey, my laptop is running abnormally hot, and the fan is on constantly. Is there a way to cool things down?
2007-05-17T16:28:00.000Z	yo_noob	Frem	check what is eating CPU w/ top
2007-05-17T16:28:00.000Z	Frem	yo_noob	Nothing. pidgin is the most resource intensive thing running, and it's only taking 2%
2007-05-17T16:30:00.000Z	yo_noob	Frem	cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor
2007-05-17T16:31:00.000Z	Frem	yo_noob	No such file or directory
2007-05-17T16:32:00.000Z	yo_noob	Frem	lsmod |grep cpu
2007-05-17T16:32:00.000Z	yo_noob	Frem	does it show cpufreq?
2007-05-17T16:33:00.000Z	Frem	yo_noob	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/21215/
2007-05-17T16:33:00.000Z	Frem	yo_noob	i think so.
2007-05-17T16:38:00.000Z	yo_noob	Frem	what is the cpu on the lappy
2007-05-17T16:38:00.000Z	Frem	yo_noob	a pentium M, 1.60 GHz.
2007-05-17T16:39:00.000Z	Frem	yo_noob	Also, the display has started randomly flashing white every few minutes. I'm afraid the video card might be overheating or something. I'm using the fglrx drivers.
2007-05-17T16:41:00.000Z	yo_noob	Frem	try "sudo modprobe speedstep-ich"
2007-05-17T16:42:00.000Z	Frem	yo_noob	FATAL: Error inserting speedstep_ich (/lib/modules/2.6.20-15-generic/kernel/arch/i386/kernel/cpu/cpufreq/speedstep-ich.ko): No such device
2007-05-17T16:43:00.000Z	yo_noob	Frem	sorry, can't help more but basically looks like speedstep is not functional.
2007-05-17T16:43:00.000Z	Frem	yo_noob	So I need to find out how to enable it?
2007-05-17T16:44:00.000Z	yo_noob	Frem	ya, try googling speedstep with you laptop model no etc.
2007-05-17T16:44:00.000Z	Frem	yo_noob	thanks much for your help. :-)
