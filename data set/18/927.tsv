2011-11-22T19:12:00.000Z	emachines		good morning. I am trying to install ubuntu on my emachines G725 but I can see nothing because the brightness is at 1%... anyone got an idea?
2011-11-22T19:12:00.000Z	soreau	emachines	How do you know the brightness is at 1%?
2011-11-22T19:13:00.000Z	emachines	soreau	i can see that there is something on the sreen
2011-11-22T19:13:00.000Z	soreau	emachines	What graphics card?
2011-11-22T19:13:00.000Z	emachines	soreau	I dont know
2011-11-22T19:14:00.000Z	soreau	emachines	Well it's gonna be pretty difficult if you can't even get to a working terminal shell. Can you get to a tty with Ctrl+Alt+F2?
2011-11-22T19:15:00.000Z	emachines	soreau	I guess. something is changing on the screen
2011-11-22T19:15:00.000Z	soreau	emachines	I mean a usable tty..
2011-11-22T19:15:00.000Z	emachines	soreau	no
2011-11-22T19:15:00.000Z	emachines	soreau	i just startet the install from the CD
2011-11-22T19:16:00.000Z	emachines	soreau	is there another way to open a terminal?
2011-11-22T19:16:00.000Z	soreau	emachines	At what point in the boot phase does the screen go to 1% brightness?
2011-11-22T19:17:00.000Z	emachines	soreau	well first i see this screen with the 2 icons at the buttom (some humans) after that its dark
2011-11-22T19:17:00.000Z	soreau	emachines	There might be a parameter you can pass to the kernel but you'd have to do some experimenting. Try booting with 'nomodeset' or 'text' maybe
2011-11-22T19:17:00.000Z	soreau	emachines	When you see the icon at the bottom, press Esc to get to the boot menu
2011-11-22T19:18:00.000Z	emachines	soreau	ok
2011-11-22T19:18:00.000Z	emachines	soreau	i am in the boot menu
2011-11-22T19:18:00.000Z	soreau	emachines	I believe 'e' should bring you to the screen where you can edit kernel parameters
