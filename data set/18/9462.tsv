2007-04-04T15:22:00.000Z	Harpette		i'm a bit confused: i removed gnome-screensaver with the help of Synaptic, then later it occurred to me that there might be some pkgs which depend on it, so i asked apt-cache for rdepends, and got some. So i thought that Synaptic should've either removed them, or warned me. I also tried a "apt-get -f install" which replies "0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded". So it looks like apt-cache is mistaken, right?
2007-04-04T15:22:00.000Z	Harpette		oh yeah i meant to say i replaced it with xscreensaver
2007-04-04T15:23:00.000Z	Flannel	Harpette	What depends on it?
2007-04-04T15:23:00.000Z	Harpette	Flannel	one moment please
2007-04-04T15:24:00.000Z	Harpette	Flannel	gnome-control-center,  xscreensaver-data,   ubuntu-desktop, rss-glx
2007-04-04T15:24:00.000Z	Flannel	Harpette	ubuntu-desktop, and I imagine the others, don't depend.  u-d recommends
2007-04-04T15:24:00.000Z	Harpette	Flannel	i also tried with the -i option (important), and the answer's the same
2007-04-04T15:25:00.000Z	Flannel	Harpette	Well, ubuntu-desktop recommends, g-c-c suggests gnome-screensaver or xscreensaver, Im sure it's similar with the others
2007-04-04T15:25:00.000Z	Harpette	Flannel	ah, cool then. Thank you
2007-04-04T15:29:00.000Z	Harpette	Flannel	i also have another mystery: "apt-cache -a=no -n --installed depends xscreensaver-data" says "Replaces: xscreensaver"; when i installed xscreensaver it didn't complain about xscreensaver-data being here
2007-04-04T15:31:00.000Z	Flannel	Harpette	Eh?  I really don't think xscreensaver-data replaces xscreensaer
2007-04-04T15:32:00.000Z	Harpette	Flannel	surprised me too
2007-04-04T15:32:00.000Z	Flannel	Harpette	well, I'm looking at the package riht now, and I don't see it.
2007-04-04T15:32:00.000Z	Harpette	Flannel	so apt-cache is loosing it? perhaps i need to regenerate the cache or smthing
2007-04-04T15:34:00.000Z	Flannel	Harpette	Oh.  That is "Replaces: xscreensaver (<< 4.23-2ubuntu4)
2007-04-04T15:34:00.000Z	Flannel	Harpette	which is old versions
2007-04-04T15:34:00.000Z	Flannel	Harpette	the current, in that case being -ubuntu8
2007-04-04T15:35:00.000Z	Harpette	Flannel	ah. Thank you again. I guess i must've not asked apt-cache to properly display the pkg version number or what
