2008-01-26T03:43:00.000Z	cloversg		Can anyone tell me how to stop gdm from automatically starting?  i would like to start 6.06 in terminal mode and then move to graphics if and when required.
2008-01-26T03:45:00.000Z	erUSUL	cloversg	sudo update-rc.d -f gdm remove
2008-01-26T03:46:00.000Z	erUSUL	cloversg	that will disable gdm from init scripts so you will get what you asked for
2008-01-26T03:47:00.000Z	erUSUL	cloversg	sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start when you need Xwindows (or startx)
2008-01-26T03:48:00.000Z	cloversg	erUSUL	ok, that's what I wanted.  I am trying to configure a lightweight gnome terminal using the 6.06 server.  Can you point me to a site which shows what is contained in the rc directories and which is which?
2008-01-26T03:50:00.000Z	erUSUL	cloversg	i do not remember any from the top of my head google around
2008-01-26T03:52:00.000Z	cloversg	erUSUL	- I did, but your answer seems to be on the mark.  Was searching around the rc's to stop gdm, Thanks
2008-01-26T03:52:00.000Z	erUSUL	cloversg	no problem ;)
2010-06-26T19:06:00.000Z	erUSUL	cloversg	define "intermittent response"
2010-06-26T19:06:00.000Z	cloversg	erUSUL	stops responding for 1-2 secs screens turn dark
2010-06-26T19:10:00.000Z	erUSUL	cloversg	something in dmesg ? or in the logs ? /var/log/messages /var/log/syslog ?
2010-06-26T19:11:00.000Z	erUSUL	cloversg	only happens with nautilus? cp or rsync or other methods of moving copying did not fail ?
2010-06-26T19:13:00.000Z	erUSUL	cloversg	well there is not much info to figure out what may be wrong ...
2010-06-26T19:21:00.000Z	erUSUL	cloversg	lloks like maybe your hard disk is having issues.. but if that's the case then something should appear in dmesg
2010-06-26T19:22:00.000Z	erUSUL	cloversg	i/o errors of some kind
2010-06-26T19:22:00.000Z	cloversg	erUSUL	I thought so, so did a XFS_check, but not having any bad results
2010-06-26T19:27:00.000Z	erUSUL	cloversg	looks like xfs kernel threath... i do not use xfs so i dunno ...
2010-06-26T19:29:00.000Z	erUSUL	cloversg	well may be a bug xfs is said to be good performant
