2006-08-30T05:04:00.000Z	OmegaNine	Losty81	You can access your XP partition under Ubuntu by defualt
2006-08-30T05:08:00.000Z	OmegaNine	Losty81	Its duel boot though right?
2006-08-30T05:09:00.000Z	OmegaNine	Losty81	Then DL it to XP, you will be able to access it via Linux
2006-08-30T05:12:00.000Z	OmegaNine	Losty81	There may be, but i use intel - so ubuntu wouldnt install it
2006-08-30T05:14:00.000Z	OmegaNine	Losty81	LOL you are screwed at every corner
2006-08-30T05:15:00.000Z	OmegaNine	Losty81	You will need to get a dpk called "build-essential" and put that on your Windows partition too
2006-08-30T05:16:00.000Z	OmegaNine	Losty81	Then when you get in linux, install it, and do a "./configure" "make" "sudo make isntall"
2006-08-30T05:17:00.000Z	OmegaNine	Losty81	Yeah that was "sudo make install" sorry
2006-08-30T05:22:00.000Z	OmegaNine	Losty81	Give me a second, I used apt-get but you will not be able to
2006-08-30T05:24:00.000Z	OmegaNine	Losty81	You use X86 right?
2006-08-30T05:25:00.000Z	OmegaNine	Losty81	 ^^
