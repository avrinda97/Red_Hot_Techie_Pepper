2008-05-02T05:24:00.000Z	eboyjr		I have a folder set as 766. and I can't create a folder inside it with Archive Manager! Why is that?
2008-05-02T05:25:00.000Z	zionpsyfer	eboyjr	You the owner of the folder?
2008-05-02T05:26:00.000Z	eboyjr	zionpsyfer	How do I find out? I don't think so though... its /var/www/
2008-05-02T05:28:00.000Z	zionpsyfer	eboyjr	Usually when I'm working in /var/www on my boxes, I'll either run 'gksudo nautilus' to edit as root, or if I'm in a terminal, I'll do a 'sudo -i' first.
2008-05-02T05:28:00.000Z	zionpsyfer	eboyjr	 I can
2008-05-02T05:29:00.000Z	zionpsyfer	eboyjr	 ........ I can't say that it's the approved method of working in the webroot folder, but it is better than a chmod -R 777 to it for sure.
2008-05-02T05:30:00.000Z	eboyjr	zionpsyfer	I understand... thx
2008-05-02T05:31:00.000Z	zionpsyfer	eboyjr	No worries, hope I helped.
2008-05-02T06:38:00.000Z	zionpsyfer	eboyjr	you have tried a simple php page to see if apache processes it?
2008-05-02T06:39:00.000Z	eboyjr	zionpsyfer	Yeah, its actually a setup sctript for phpmyadmin... But it still prompt to download it.
2008-05-02T06:42:00.000Z	zionpsyfer	eboyjr	try sticking this in your index.html file :  <?php_info();?>   refresh and see if you see a bunch of php info
2008-05-02T06:43:00.000Z	eboyjr	zionpsyfer	Do you mean index.php?
2008-05-02T06:43:00.000Z	zionpsyfer	eboyjr	Gah, yes.
2008-05-02T06:44:00.000Z	eboyjr	zionpsyfer	Hmm... it works...
2008-05-02T06:45:00.000Z	zionpsyfer	eboyjr	 K, so it's phpmyadmin then.
2008-05-02T06:45:00.000Z	eboyjr	zionpsyfer	That is extremely weird. Well, thanks... I will test some more stuff.
2008-05-02T06:46:00.000Z	zionpsyfer	eboyjr	No worries.  If I may, Navicat has worked well as a replacement for phpmyadmin for me.
2008-05-02T06:47:00.000Z	zionpsyfer	eboyjr	An alternative if you can't get phpmyadmin working.
