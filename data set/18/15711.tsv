2005-02-12T13:04:00.000Z	mebaran151		I think the problem is most of the extensions are not built for the 64 bit libraries
2005-02-12T13:04:00.000Z	mebaran151		they expect 32 bit pointers
2005-02-12T13:04:00.000Z	mebaran151		which I cant provide
2005-02-12T13:04:00.000Z	mebaran151		because my system is completely 64 bit
2005-02-12T13:04:00.000Z	mebaran151		Mozilla is cross platform
2005-02-12T13:05:00.000Z	mebaran151		but I think it did need a little bit of porting to work
2005-02-12T13:05:00.000Z	mebaran151		on all the architectures
2005-02-12T13:05:00.000Z	mebaran151		internally it is all the same
2005-02-12T13:05:00.000Z	mebaran151		but the application loader itself and that sort of thing probably had to be ported
2005-02-12T13:05:00.000Z	mebaran151		slimo: I do
2005-02-12T13:06:00.000Z	siimo	mebaran151	do you know?
2005-02-12T13:09:00.000Z	siimo	mebaran151	yes i know that but i have to make minimum size very big to make it behave like it used to
2005-02-12T13:13:00.000Z	mebaran151	siimo	but this is a silly bug
2005-02-12T13:13:00.000Z	mebaran151	siimo	nope 2.8
2005-02-12T13:19:00.000Z	siimo	mebaran151	have you also noticed the nautilus zooming makes fonts too small to read smaller than the minium set it gnome-font-properties
2005-02-12T13:26:00.000Z	mebaran151	siimo	just set it a tad larger
2005-02-12T13:29:00.000Z	mebaran151	siimo	it is a silly bug
2005-02-12T13:31:00.000Z	mebaran151	siimo	it is brain surgery
