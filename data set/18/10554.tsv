2006-11-25T11:47:00.000Z	dabaR	matroblend	it seems it is a bug with the fre driver, according to this https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/xserver-xorg-driver-ati/+bug/58541, can you read a little and see whether it applies to your issue?
2006-11-25T11:48:00.000Z	matroblend	dabaR	ok
2006-11-25T11:55:00.000Z	dabaR	matroblend	me either. wait for someone to be available on #ubuntu-xgl.
2006-11-25T11:57:00.000Z	matroblend	dabaR	Post the error on xgl?
2006-11-25T11:58:00.000Z	dabaR	matroblend	ya, ask about your error on that channel, and wait for someone to be able to help, sorry, that is the only thing I can recommend.
2006-11-25T11:59:00.000Z	matroblend	dabaR	thankyou at least you are trying and I am farther than before
