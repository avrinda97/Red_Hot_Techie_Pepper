2010-05-15T17:22:00.000Z	Untouchab1e		Hi all.. having some issues. I had the latest Nvidia drivers installed from nvidia.com on my Ubuntu 9.10, then I upgraded to 10.04 and off course the nvidia graphics needed to be reconfigured but I figured I should install them from the hardware drivers thingie instead.
2010-05-15T17:22:00.000Z	Untouchab1e		but it failed to install, so I reckoned I had to remove the nvidia drivers first, so I did a sudo apt-get --purge remove nvidia-*
2010-05-15T17:23:00.000Z	Untouchab1e		but now I just get a black screen >_<
2010-05-15T17:23:00.000Z	Untouchab1e		Any ideas on what I can do?
2010-05-15T17:23:00.000Z	soreau	Untouchab1e	To get back into X, use Driver vesa (instead of nvidia) in your xorg.conf file
2010-05-15T17:24:00.000Z	Untouchab1e	soreau	problem is that I dont get anything. After the initial Ubuntu loading screen (with the dots) the screen just goes black
2010-05-15T17:24:00.000Z	Untouchab1e		tried hitting ctrl+alt+f1, but nothing happens
2010-05-15T17:24:00.000Z	soreau	Untouchab1e	You may have to boot into recovery mode
2010-05-15T17:25:00.000Z	Untouchab1e	soreau	ok..
2010-05-15T17:26:00.000Z	Untouchab1e	soreau	to get into recovery mode I just hit esc right? but nothing happens
2010-05-15T17:27:00.000Z	Untouchab1e		fixed it with holding shift..
2010-05-15T17:27:00.000Z	Untouchab1e		esc is legacy
2010-05-15T17:27:00.000Z	soreau	Untouchab1e	You have to press esc right after your bios loads, then go into the grup menu select the recovery mode entry from the list
2010-05-15T17:27:00.000Z	soreau		ah
2010-05-15T17:27:00.000Z	Untouchab1e		:)
2010-05-15T17:27:00.000Z	Untouchab1e	soreau	hmm.. still get a black screen :(
2010-05-15T17:28:00.000Z	soreau	Untouchab1e	I guess something else is wrong then. Does this same thing happen if you try a live cd?
2010-05-15T17:28:00.000Z	Untouchab1e	soreau	I doubt it, as Ive been running Ubuntu on there for years without problems..
