2010-02-25T01:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		Meganerd: it can, its just not pretty
2010-02-25T01:30:00.000Z	meganerd	ActionParsnip	by not pretty you mean that you have to have Linux installed onto an FS that Windows understands, which means vfat
2010-02-25T01:31:00.000Z	meganerd	ActionParsnip	not something you can do after the fact
2010-02-25T01:32:00.000Z	meganerd	ActionParsnip	I do not think that works unless your /boot directory is on its own partition formatted vfat (or fat32 or fat16)
2011-08-11T03:26:00.000Z	meganerd	ActionParsnip	it is an integrated GPU into the platform aka chipset
2011-08-11T03:27:00.000Z	meganerd	ActionParsnip	just an improved version of what shipped with Core2 and Lynnefield
2011-08-11T03:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	meganerd	I haven't kept up with hardware for a long time. My needs are so basic a Sempron AM2 with 1Gb RAM does as much as I'll ever need
2011-08-11T03:31:00.000Z	meganerd	ActionParsnip	I know what you mean.  The only reason I really looked in to it is because I replaced my audio rig and could not get the GPU to work on 10.10
2011-08-11T03:32:00.000Z	meganerd	ActionParsnip	I had an AMD 4400+ with DDR RAM before the power supply cooked the motherboard
2011-08-11T03:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	meganerd	I always buy mid range Nvidias for an easy life
2011-08-11T03:34:00.000Z	meganerd	ActionParsnip	ATI has been better for me since the 4xxx series, I don't have to bother with the nvidia blob
2011-08-11T03:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	meganerd	nvidia have being making drivers for Linux the entire time Ive used Linux, never had a sinle issue so I stick by. Any company supporting Linux gets my money :D
2011-08-11T03:37:00.000Z	meganerd	ActionParsnip	I know, but ATI hired Novel to write an open 3d driver for their modern hardware, which generally works out of the box, even on low latency kernels, something I have struggled with nVidia hardware with for the better part of a decade.
2011-08-11T03:37:00.000Z	meganerd	ActionParsnip	ATI a few years ago was a nightmare
2011-08-11T03:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	meganerd	oh very
2011-08-11T03:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	meganerd	probably buy a trimslice next, just as a treat
