2005-02-22T11:32:00.000Z	siridhar		does ubuntu use genkernel to build the kernel?
2005-02-22T11:33:00.000Z	crimsun	siridhar	isn't genkernel Gentoo-born?
2005-02-22T11:34:00.000Z	siridhar	crimsun	ok sorry, then may be it's not applicable. I am browsing http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook-x86.xml?part=1&chap=10#doc_chap2 to understand how I to edit grub file
2005-02-22T11:35:00.000Z	siridhar	crimsun	I installed Ubuntu but the graphical interface is not starting. Also grub doesn't have windows XP option. Any solution?
2005-02-22T11:36:00.000Z	crimsun	siridhar	need more information regarding your graphics hardware and current Ubuntu configuration.
2005-02-22T11:37:00.000Z	siridhar	crimsun	pls look here --> http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=67967#post67967
2005-02-22T11:42:00.000Z	crimsun	siridhar	what graphics chipset?
2005-02-22T11:42:00.000Z	siridhar	crimsun	let me check. one minute
2005-02-22T11:45:00.000Z	siridhar	crimsun	would that be Display Video adapter?
2005-02-22T11:46:00.000Z	siridhar	crimsun	Display Video Adapter:    VIA/S3G UniChromeII Graphics (64 MB)
2005-02-22T11:48:00.000Z	crimsun	siridhar	hmm. You need a newer version of the X Window System if I remember correctly
2005-02-22T11:48:00.000Z	siridhar	crimsun	ok. how do I get that from the command line? What do I type?
2005-02-22T11:49:00.000Z	crimsun	siridhar	out of curiosity, have you tried Array 4 or newer?
2005-02-22T11:49:00.000Z	crimsun	siridhar	(see the last section of the topic)
2005-02-22T11:51:00.000Z	siridhar	crimsun	If I manage to download and burn that to a CD, once I put it in the drive, can I simply point the same location on the harddrive that I used to install ubuntu earlier? Will it overwrite everything and work?
2005-02-22T11:53:00.000Z	crimsun	siridhar	you may use the same location, yes. Whether it works cannot be guaranteed, as Array 4 is a milestone.
2005-02-22T11:54:00.000Z	siridhar	crimsun	shall try that. b4 that is there anything I can do to fix my current situation? at least is it possible for me to boot windows XP?
2005-02-22T11:55:00.000Z	crimsun	siridhar	it should be; I'm not a grub guru, however, so others will be more helpful. Also, please search the wiki and the forum.
