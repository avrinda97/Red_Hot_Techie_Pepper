2009-01-25T07:15:00.000Z	Chaorain2	DasEi	so who do I chmod/chown them to? the user "nobody"?
2009-01-25T07:19:00.000Z	Chaorain2	DasEi	I can't access my dir after sudo chmod 0700 /dir/whatever
2009-01-25T07:29:00.000Z	Chaorain2	DasEi	I think we are going after the wrong problem. Vista says it can't access DAN-DESKTOP (my ubuntu computer)

2009-01-25T07:42:00.000Z	Chaorain2	DasEi	Its in the same workgroup
2009-01-25T07:43:00.000Z	Chaorain2	DasEi	I can't check it with XP as that one is dual booting ubuntu
2009-01-25T08:01:00.000Z	DasEi	Chaorain2	oh, yes, and install ext2tnfs  on vista
2009-01-25T08:03:00.000Z	Chaorain2	DasEi	you mean ext2ntfs? for samba?
