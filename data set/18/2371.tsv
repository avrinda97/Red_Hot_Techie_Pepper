2010-06-03T10:13:00.000Z	unop	topangea	the account is not root by any chance, is it? if not, what is the account's shall as per /etc/passwd ?
2010-06-03T10:13:00.000Z	topangea		no, it's not :)
2010-06-03T10:13:00.000Z	topangea		shell is /bin/bash
2010-06-03T10:13:00.000Z	unop	topangea	is the account locked/disabled?
2010-06-03T10:14:00.000Z	topangea		nope, it's enabled
2010-06-03T10:14:00.000Z	topangea		at least webmin says it is..let me check /etc/passwd
2010-06-03T10:14:00.000Z	unop	topangea	can you log on using a shall at the machine itself?
2010-06-03T10:15:00.000Z	topangea		looks enabled
2010-06-03T10:15:00.000Z	topangea		nothing strange in /etc/shadow
2010-06-03T10:15:00.000Z	unop	topangea	can you log on using a shell at the machine itself?
2010-06-03T10:16:00.000Z	topangea	unop	no
2010-06-03T10:16:00.000Z	topangea		I wonder
2010-06-03T10:16:00.000Z	unop	topangea	what's the error you get?
2010-06-03T10:16:00.000Z	topangea		I bet the password is wrong
2010-06-03T10:16:00.000Z	topangea		 Ididn't setup this account
2010-06-03T10:16:00.000Z	topangea		and I assumed the smbpasswd was the same as the account
2010-06-03T10:16:00.000Z	topangea		but it probably isn't :/
2010-06-03T10:17:00.000Z	unop	topangea	smbpasswd does not change the unix passwd
