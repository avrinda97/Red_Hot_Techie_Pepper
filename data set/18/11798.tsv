2011-01-05T06:04:00.000Z	chaospsychex		im uninstalling this crapass ftp server
2011-01-05T06:05:00.000Z	v0lksman	chaospsychex	vsftp used to be the best...no clue anymore since I stopped using FTP servers...what are you planning to do with yours?
2011-01-05T06:06:00.000Z	v0lksman	chaospsychex	SFTP works without any additional software...just use your user login and it will work
2011-01-05T06:06:00.000Z	v0lksman	chaospsychex	just a setting in most FTP clients
2011-01-05T06:07:00.000Z	v0lksman	chaospsychex	FileZilla will connect via SFTP without issue
2011-01-05T06:08:00.000Z	v0lksman	chaospsychex	right...forgot not everyone installs ssh...hahaha...but just install the package and presto
2011-01-05T06:10:00.000Z	v0lksman	chaospsychex	well you didn't say that...
2011-01-05T06:10:00.000Z	v0lksman	chaospsychex	but you can still do that with ssh
2011-01-05T06:10:00.000Z	v0lksman	chaospsychex	oh and yeah...I have too...many many many...too many...that's why I quit... ;)
2011-01-05T06:12:00.000Z	v0lksman	chaospsychex	so why not go samba?  offsite access?
2011-01-05T06:13:00.000Z	v0lksman	chaospsychex	hahaha...seems you know little about FTP too.. :)
2011-01-05T06:15:00.000Z	v0lksman	chaospsychex	http://www.howtoforge.com/chrooted-ssh-sftp-tutorial-debian-lenny  steps 2 and 3 will get you a lock down via SFTP
2011-01-05T06:16:00.000Z	v0lksman	chaospsychex	you did say you were on 10.10 right?
2011-01-05T06:18:00.000Z	v0lksman	chaospsychex	what I sent will lock the user into their home directory...you can then put whatever you want in that directory for them
2011-01-05T06:20:00.000Z	v0lksman	chaospsychex	if you type those 4 lines REALLY slowly, yeah it might...
