2010-07-23T02:09:00.000Z	thepeon		I need help moving a home directory to a new partition on a seperate harddrive.
2010-07-23T02:09:00.000Z	DasEi	thepeon	fine, let's go
2010-07-23T02:10:00.000Z	thepeon	DasEi	I've copied the directory and changed fstab, but I keep geting an error on restart
2010-07-23T02:10:00.000Z	DasEi	thepeon	sudo apt-get install pastebinit
2010-07-23T02:11:00.000Z	DasEi	thepeon	sudo chown Regularusername /home/UserName/.ICEauthority
2010-07-23T02:13:00.000Z	DasEi	thepeon	pastebinit /etc/fstab
2010-07-23T02:14:00.000Z	thepeon	DasEi	What does pastebinit do??
2010-07-23T02:15:00.000Z	DasEi	thepeon	gives us  a link to have look at fstab
2010-07-23T02:18:00.000Z	DasEi	thepeon	I assume sda7 is right, and add :      ,user  to defaults
2010-07-23T02:19:00.000Z	DasEi	thepeon	sudo fdisk -l shows your partis
2010-07-23T02:23:00.000Z	thepeon	DasEi	^peanut^, just found out not all of my files moved last time (X crashed and I thought I gave it enought time).  Should take a few hours, but I think it was manly the premissions, so I'll fix that and try again.
2010-07-23T02:24:00.000Z	DasEi	thepeon	use rsync -u, so can save time
2010-07-23T02:24:00.000Z	thepeon	DasEi	I used find . -depth -print0 | cpio --null --sparse -pvd /mnt/newhome/
2010-07-23T02:26:00.000Z	DasEi	thepeon	rsync may also be interrupted and can be continued later
2010-07-23T02:27:00.000Z	DasEi	thepeon	option -P  shows a progress
2010-07-23T03:11:00.000Z	thepeon	DasEi	^peanut^:  everything is copied over and worked with reboot.  Thanks for the help
2010-07-23T03:11:00.000Z	DasEi	thepeon	fell home, lol
2010-07-23T03:11:00.000Z	thepeon	DasEi	yep
