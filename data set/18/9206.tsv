2007-09-22T08:25:00.000Z	dfcarney		Last time I booted Ubuntu it updated a bunch of packages.  Now, video playback (via totem, vlc, kaffeine) doesn't work.  Does anyone have any ideas?
2007-09-22T08:26:00.000Z	Stettin	dfcarney	does sound work and you can click menus?
2007-09-22T08:26:00.000Z	dfcarney	Stettin	yes
2007-09-22T08:26:00.000Z	Stettin		i have the same issue haven't had any luck
2007-09-22T08:26:00.000Z	dfcarney	Stettin	Playback was working perfectly the other day.
2007-09-22T08:26:00.000Z	Stettin		i've reinstalled every package for DVD still no luck
2007-09-22T08:27:00.000Z	Stettin		mine was working until i accidentally hosed my install, then reinstalled and haven't been able to get it working using my same exact guides and steps I've used 5-6 times successfully
2007-09-22T08:28:00.000Z	dfcarney	Stettin	yeah, this is driving me crazy
2007-09-22T08:28:00.000Z	dfcarney	Stettin	I've tried reinstalling various packages, with no luck
2007-09-22T08:28:00.000Z	Stettin		i wonder if there is a bug tracker yet.. i haven't seen anything on google about this problem for Feisty, but I've seen it reported on Edgy back in 2006
2007-09-22T08:29:00.000Z	Stettin		err. dapper
2007-09-22T08:29:00.000Z	dfcarney	Stettin	what kind of video card do you have?
2007-09-22T08:31:00.000Z	Stettin	dfcarney	ATI x600 (on a pc), with ATI driver
2007-09-22T08:31:00.000Z	Stettin	dfcarney	I have beryl installed but it video doesn't work with desktop effects off or on
2007-09-22T08:31:00.000Z	dfcarney	Stettin	I've got an ATI too (Radeon 9000)
2007-09-22T08:32:00.000Z	Stettin		i'm tempted to try the other driver, but would have to sacrifice 3d accel
2007-09-22T08:36:00.000Z	dfcarney	Stettin	well, i have no idea
2007-09-22T08:47:00.000Z	dfcarney	Stettin	I got it working.  I'm not sure what, exactly, fixed it, but I did the following: re-install libdvdcss2 and w32codecs, restart X, select my "default session" to be Gnome (i.e. NOT the safe mode)
