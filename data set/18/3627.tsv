2009-09-01T03:36:00.000Z	Guest522		hi, does anybody have a home webserver here?
2009-09-01T03:37:00.000Z	Guest522		ok, well ive just put ubuntu on a home tower, i have just worked out how to login to my netgear router, and was wondering about port forwarding
2009-09-01T03:38:00.000Z	Guest522		do i port forwad the server ip, in the http:
2009-09-01T03:38:00.000Z	scunizi	Guest522	what about it?
2009-09-01T03:38:00.000Z	scunizi	Guest522	ah.. you're running a http server?
2009-09-01T03:39:00.000Z	scunizi	Guest522	yep.. same thing.. be aware that most ISP's block port 80 on home internet service.. you might need to use something like DynDNS.com
2009-09-01T03:39:00.000Z	scunizi	Guest522	works the other way around.. you need to forward port 80 to your webserver
2009-09-01T03:40:00.000Z	scunizi	Guest522	is your server getting it's IP automatically from your router? if so you'll need to make it static
2009-09-01T03:41:00.000Z	scunizi	Guest522	then in the router, typically in the "Game" section is where you forward tcp/ip port 80 to the ip of your server
2009-09-01T03:45:00.000Z	scunizi	Guest522	server
2009-09-01T03:47:00.000Z	scunizi	Guest522	nope.. that's not it.. should be something like 192.168.0.xxx
2009-09-01T03:49:00.000Z	scunizi	Guest522	nope.. that's the routers address.. your machine is in the same range but the last number is different.
2009-09-01T03:49:00.000Z	scunizi	Guest522	might be.. where did you get that info?
2009-09-01T03:51:00.000Z	Guest522	scunizi	clicked start, rightclicked on wireless network conections, status then clicked support
2009-09-01T03:52:00.000Z	scunizi	Guest522	if that was done on the server machine then it sounds right.
2009-09-01T03:53:00.000Z	scunizi	Guest522	are you trying to get to the server from inside your lan?
2009-09-01T03:53:00.000Z	scunizi	Guest522	 then just open a browser and type the ip address.. like 192.168.1.2:80
2009-09-01T03:55:00.000Z	scunizi	Guest522	try  http://192.168.1.2:80
