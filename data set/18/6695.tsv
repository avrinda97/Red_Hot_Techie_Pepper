2008-06-27T09:47:00.000Z	Shaba2		anyone know is there anyway except editing that file in /etc of stopping ubuntu from putting my laptop into suspend mode?
2008-06-27T09:48:00.000Z	dmsuperman	Shaba2	what's wrong with editing files?
2008-06-27T09:49:00.000Z	dmsuperman	Shaba2	those things attached to your legs are feet
2008-06-27T09:49:00.000Z	dmsuperman	Shaba2	or, for the really lazy...install SSH on your desktop so next time you don't have to
2008-06-27T09:52:00.000Z	dmsuperman	Shaba2	yet you have time to chat :P
2008-06-27T09:59:00.000Z	dmsuperman	Shaba2	RealVNC
2008-06-27T09:59:00.000Z	dmsuperman	Shaba2	wait, windows is the VNC server
2008-06-27T09:59:00.000Z	dmsuperman	Shaba2	type "vncviewer" from the commandline
2008-06-27T10:03:00.000Z	Shaba2	dmsuperman	that woudl start the view on the linux machine
2008-06-27T10:04:00.000Z	dmsuperman	Shaba2	so, you have a linux vnc server, windows vnc client?
2008-06-27T10:04:00.000Z	dmsuperman	Shaba2	the windows app you want is RealVNC
2008-06-27T10:05:00.000Z	dmsuperman	Shaba2	listener means that it's the server. either windows is the server (as you said) or ubuntu is, which is it?
2008-06-27T10:08:00.000Z	dmsuperman	Shaba2	right
2008-06-27T10:08:00.000Z	dmsuperman	Shaba2	right. you said your windows vnc listener, and you also said you want to VNC INTO ubuntu
2008-06-27T10:09:00.000Z	dmsuperman	Shaba2	your description is conflicting
2008-06-27T10:09:00.000Z	dmsuperman	Shaba2	I'm well aware of what a server/listener is
2008-06-27T10:10:00.000Z	dmsuperman	Shaba2	x11vnc
