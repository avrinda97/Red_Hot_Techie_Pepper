2006-07-20T15:35:00.000Z	FusE		4. Type "find /boot/grub/stage1". You'll get a response like "(hd0)" or in my case "(hd0,3)". Use whatever your computer spits out for the following lines.
2006-07-20T15:35:00.000Z	FusE		5. Type "root (hd0,3)".
2006-07-20T15:35:00.000Z	FusE		6. Type "setup (hd0,3)". This is key. Other instructions say to use "(hd0)", and that's fine if you want to write GRUB to the MBR. If you want to write it to your linux root partition, then you want the number after the comma, such as "(hd0,3)".
2006-07-20T15:35:00.000Z	FusE		7. Type "quit".
2006-07-20T15:35:00.000Z	FusE		What does that do exactly?
2006-07-20T15:36:00.000Z	FusE		l33t
2006-07-20T15:36:00.000Z	FusE		I know it sets up grub
2006-07-20T15:36:00.000Z	FusE		But does it overwrite the MBR
2006-07-20T15:36:00.000Z	FusE		Does it work with the Windows bootloader?
2006-07-20T15:36:00.000Z	FusE		what does it do
2006-07-20T15:36:00.000Z	Subhuman	FusE	it adds windows to the grub menu
2006-07-20T15:47:00.000Z	Subhuman	FusE	 do "sudo mkdir mount/win && sudo mount -t ntfs /dev/hda1 /media/win"
2006-07-20T15:47:00.000Z	FusE	Subhuman	can not create directory, no such file or directory
2006-07-20T15:48:00.000Z	Subhuman	FusE	"sudo mkdir /mount/win && sudo mount -t ntfs /dev/hda1 /media/win"
2006-07-20T15:48:00.000Z	Subhuman	FusE	then do "gksudo nautilus" and navigate to /mount/win and there you are
2006-07-20T15:49:00.000Z	Subhuman	FusE	sudo mk
2006-07-20T15:50:00.000Z	Subhuman	FusE	mine was wrong
2006-07-20T16:06:00.000Z	Subhuman	FusE	no.
