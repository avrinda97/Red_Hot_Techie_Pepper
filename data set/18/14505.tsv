2005-07-18T16:43:00.000Z	pasv		How is it that you do net mounts?
2005-07-18T16:44:00.000Z	Nermal	pasv	nfs ?
2005-07-18T16:44:00.000Z	Nermal	pasv	then mount <ip>/<server>:/path/to/exported/mountpoint /local/mountpoint
2005-07-18T16:46:00.000Z	pasv	Nermal	How do you set that up on the server side?
2005-07-18T16:46:00.000Z	Nermal	pasv	install the nfs server stuff, edit /etc/exports and start the nfs server
2005-07-18T16:48:00.000Z	pasv	Nermal	isn't nfs insecure though?
2005-07-18T16:48:00.000Z	Nermal	pasv	erm.. depends what you mean by secure
2005-07-18T16:50:00.000Z	Nermal	pasv	permissions wise it's reasonable.. as long as you have root_squash enabled
2005-07-18T16:52:00.000Z	Nermal	pasv	nfs will maintain permissions via file owner UID
