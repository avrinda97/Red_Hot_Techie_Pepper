2007-11-07T18:25:00.000Z	PrMoriarty		do you know a good soft for read the output of a com port?
2007-11-07T18:25:00.000Z	PrMoriarty		serial port
2007-11-07T18:27:00.000Z	cef	PrMoriarty	Crtl-A then P doesn't work?
2007-11-07T18:27:00.000Z	PrMoriarty	cef	but doesn t work during running
2007-11-07T18:28:00.000Z	cef	PrMoriarty	define "during running"? cos I've changed the port speed many times
2007-11-07T18:28:00.000Z	PrMoriarty	cef	i mean i boot my server, then i use minicom it doesn t work
2007-11-07T18:28:00.000Z	PrMoriarty	cef	if i use minicom first then i boot it s ok
2007-11-07T18:29:00.000Z	PrMoriarty	cef	you too?
2007-11-07T18:29:00.000Z	cef	PrMoriarty	ok that's a bit sus.. have you removed the init strings in minicom? perhaps they're causing an issue.
2007-11-07T18:32:00.000Z	PrMoriarty	cef	what do you mean by the init string?
2007-11-07T18:32:00.000Z	PrMoriarty	cef	tdon t think i removed it so
2007-11-07T18:33:00.000Z	cef	PrMoriarty	In the options menu (Ctrl-A then O), there is a "Modem initialisation string". You might want to remove that. At startup, minicom will try sending that to the remote host. There is also flow control and default speed options there.
2007-11-07T18:34:00.000Z	PrMoriarty	cef	yes i find it
2007-11-07T18:34:00.000Z	PrMoriarty	cef	what i have to do for remove??
2007-11-07T18:36:00.000Z	cef	PrMoriarty	just make the "Init String" blank.
2007-11-07T18:38:00.000Z	PrMoriarty	cef	i mean it was blank
2007-11-07T18:39:00.000Z	PrMoriarty	cef	you thougn i can plug the serial cable and show the output during my server running?
