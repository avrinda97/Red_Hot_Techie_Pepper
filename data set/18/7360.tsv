2010-10-21T01:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lindows	instead of saying "I'm a newbie", try websearching based on the direction givedn. You'll learn more
2010-10-21T01:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lindows	if you ran the command I gave earlier, it will search your entire drive for the file
2010-10-21T01:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lindows	run:   cd /; sudo find -iname "httpd.conf"   should show you
2010-10-21T01:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lindows	how can what be?
2010-10-21T01:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lindows	if the file doesn't exist then it will be shown as empty
2010-10-21T01:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lindows	edit the config file
2010-10-21T01:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lindows	is it in /etc/apache2/ports.conf  ?
2010-10-21T02:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lindows	try:  sudo service smbd stop; sudo service smbd start
2010-10-21T02:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lindows	try tab completing file names, guessing stuff just makes you look silly
2010-10-21T02:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lindows	yes its running and it's PID is 24686
2010-10-21T02:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lindows	did you configure any shares?
2010-10-21T02:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lindows	did what?
2010-10-21T02:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lindows	you need to use nautilus to configure shares
2010-10-21T02:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lindows	this is WHY you can't see the folders. You haven't shared any, Do you expect the OS to just guess what you want sharing??
2010-10-21T02:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lindows	open nautilus and right click a folder to share, its clear from there
