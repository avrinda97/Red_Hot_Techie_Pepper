2007-07-10T06:28:00.000Z	mneptok	kitche	if *i* don't know what PATA is, we're all in very deep trouble
2007-07-10T06:28:00.000Z	kitche	mneptok	many people don't know what pata is
2007-07-10T06:28:00.000Z	mneptok	kitche	/whois mneptok ;)
2007-07-10T06:28:00.000Z	kitche	mneptok	:P but still doesn't mean that rolfen doesn't know what pata is
2007-07-10T06:28:00.000Z	mneptok	kitche	right, but like i said, if *i* don't know .... start loking at Fedora ;)
2007-07-14T07:11:00.000Z	mneptok	kitche	Hell.
2007-07-14T07:11:00.000Z	kitche	mneptok	well he brought up gentoo and din't say about it before he just said fedora to ubuntu
2007-11-28T04:09:00.000Z	mneptok	kitche	which is why it's *really* frustrating when people don't listen when they ask for help. ;)
2007-12-14T06:32:00.000Z	kitche	mneptok	yeah read the topic :)
2007-12-14T06:33:00.000Z	kitche	mneptok	adobe broke it :) they changed the tar package
2007-12-14T06:37:00.000Z	kitche	mneptok	will ssh support alias or do you mean just alias ssh user@host so he just has to type desktop?
2007-12-14T06:37:00.000Z	mneptok	kitche	alias desktop='ssh user@host'
2007-12-14T06:38:00.000Z	kitche	mneptok	yeah I was thinking of that to but alas I don't know bash that much :)
2007-12-14T06:38:00.000Z	mneptok	kitche	neither do i. i use zsh. it's 2007, after all. ;)
2008-01-18T05:59:00.000Z	kitche	mneptok	prbably because most people either want a full desktop or they don't feel like setting up X forwarding myself I m the full desktop person but I use freenx for that when it works that is
