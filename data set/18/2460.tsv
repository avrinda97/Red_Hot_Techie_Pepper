2010-05-12T04:12:00.000Z	Confuzed		anyone know how to get nero to install on ubuntu 10.04?
2010-05-12T04:13:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Confuzed	sort of
2010-05-12T04:13:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Confuzed	however you don't really need it
2010-05-12T04:13:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Confuzed	since there are good enough  or better alternatives
2010-05-12T04:14:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Confuzed	right so Ubuntu comes with Brasero by default, which isn't exactly near like.  However if you give K3B a try :)
2010-05-12T04:14:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Confuzed	that's a KDE app, so will want to put on quite a lot of KDE stuff, if you never installed KDE stuff before,  but as long as your partition isn't a really stupid size for Ubuntu, that shoudn't be an issue at all
2010-05-12T04:15:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Confuzed	oh another one with a wireless issue
2010-05-12T04:15:00.000Z	Confuzed	sebsebseb	i haven't tried to find drivers for it
2010-05-12T04:16:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Confuzed	right read this,  and  well unless someone else starts to help you with your wireless,  I might try and help you in a bit, but right now I am trying to help Ryan__ with a wireless issue, and I don't normally do these
2010-05-12T04:17:00.000Z	Confuzed	sebsebseb	i will be hooking up a wire to PC from router soon and getting rid of the wireless
2010-05-12T04:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Confuzed	ok good :)  problem sovled then I guess, or well kind of
2010-05-12T04:19:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Confuzed	oh are you brand new?
