2005-11-06T16:12:00.000Z	nick01	bimberi	and how do I configure the pcmcia card ? cause I'm installing with the hard disk connected to a pc and then put the disk back in the laptop- no cdrom
2005-11-06T16:13:00.000Z	bimberi	nick01	wow, that's big jump from "how do I reconfigure the network ?"
2005-11-06T16:14:00.000Z	nick01	bimberi	so no setup program anywhere in site huh ?
2005-11-06T16:15:00.000Z	bimberi	nick01	not my sight no, sorry
2005-11-06T16:17:00.000Z	bimberi	nick01	from what i can see ( :) ), you should at least ensure that the "pcmcia-cs" package is installed
2005-11-06T16:21:00.000Z	bimberi	nick01	googling for 'linux pcmcia <model of card>' might come up with a suggested module, which would hopefully be in ubuntu already, but you could check with a contents search on packages.ubuntu.com
2006-02-20T17:33:00.000Z	bimberi	nick01	no firewalling by default, you might get some tips here - https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AzureusHowTo
2006-02-20T17:33:00.000Z	bimberi	nick01	np :)
2006-02-20T17:34:00.000Z	nick01	bimberi	that only tells me how to install it  :(
2006-02-20T17:34:00.000Z	bimberi	nick01	darn :/ - hoped it might mention any networking issues - sorry
2006-02-20T17:35:00.000Z	nick01	bimberi	azureus now sais I'm firewalled
2006-02-20T17:38:00.000Z	nick01	bimberi	but the included bittorrent client has no problems at all :/
2006-02-20T17:53:00.000Z	nick01	bimberi	any idea what's wrong |?
2006-02-20T17:53:00.000Z	bimberi	nick01	no idea sorry :/
