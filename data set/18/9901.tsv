2007-05-14T11:19:00.000Z	cables	Assassin`	read the link.
2007-05-14T11:20:00.000Z	cables	Assassin`	well I'm not going to spend my time reading you the document.
2007-05-14T11:20:00.000Z	cables	Assassin`	you'll just have to wait for someone else who's willing to walk you through it. There's a reason we have Ubotu here.
2007-05-14T11:21:00.000Z	cables	Assassin`	people here are willing to help people who genuinely can't figure out how to do things. You're just lazy.
2007-05-14T11:22:00.000Z	cables	Assassin`	as far as I can tell, you've made no effort at all to look at the document I sent you. If you have a specific question regarding it, we can help. Otherwise, it's just too general.
2007-05-14T11:23:00.000Z	cables	Assassin`	yes, that would be great. If you don't ask me any questions, I won't know what you need to know.
2007-05-14T11:24:00.000Z	cables	Assassin`	everything you need is there. Just read it, and if you run into any problems following the directions, ask.
2007-05-14T11:26:00.000Z	cables	Assassin`	you asked where to get it, and I sent you a link. Read what's in the link, THEN ask specific questions.
2007-05-14T11:28:00.000Z	cables	Assassin`	I don't see anything on how to install Quake 3 on Ubuntu, sorry.
2007-05-14T11:30:00.000Z	cables	Assassin`	there are a few pros... a lot of inexperienced people can still help out by using the bot or telling people what they know.
