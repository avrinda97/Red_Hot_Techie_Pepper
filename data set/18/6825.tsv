2008-04-27T03:15:00.000Z	SeaPhor	raindog	I have been using a separate /home already with 7.10, now i did a fresh install and cant get it back, i know how to set it up in the first place
2008-04-27T03:17:00.000Z	raindog	SeaPhor	So do you now have two /home directories, one on it's own partition that ubuntu isn't using?
2008-04-27T03:18:00.000Z	raindog	SeaPhor	The url I sent previously has the instructions that you can use to point to your old /home partition
2008-04-27T03:18:00.000Z	SeaPhor	raindog	well the sep one is sda6, last time i assigned it as /home in fstab but it doesnt show there
2008-04-27T03:18:00.000Z	raindog	SeaPhor	Hmm.  Did you mount it?
2008-04-27T03:19:00.000Z	SeaPhor	raindog	opened Places>Computer>78.6gig partition
2008-04-27T03:20:00.000Z	raindog	SeaPhor	Is it mounted though?
2008-04-27T03:20:00.000Z	SeaPhor	raindog	icon shows on desktop?
2008-04-27T03:21:00.000Z	raindog	SeaPhor	right click the icon, does it show an option to mount/unmount?
2008-04-27T03:21:00.000Z	SeaPhor	raindog	Unmount option
2008-04-27T03:22:00.000Z	raindog	SeaPhor	Hmm.  I'm afraid I don't have an answer for you.  Sorry.  Hopefully, one of the more knowledgeable members in here can give you a solution.  Good luck.
2008-04-27T03:23:00.000Z	SeaPhor	raindog	Thanks for trying, and sorry, i did this a month ago with 7.10 and had no probs
2008-04-27T03:23:00.000Z	raindog	SeaPhor	I may be in for the same issue when I update to 8.04 as well.
2008-04-27T03:24:00.000Z	SeaPhor	raindog	well i didnt update, did fresh install to try to fix the wireless issue i've had for nearly 5 months
2008-04-27T03:27:00.000Z	SeaPhor	raindog	hey, before i shutdown and installed 8.04 I copied my fstab to a USB flash drive, would it be safe to just copy and paste that one line into the new fstab? wouldn't use the same UUID?
2008-04-27T03:28:00.000Z	raindog	SeaPhor	To tell you the truth, I'm unsure.  At least you can use the old fstab as a reference and compare to the new one.  Of course, make backup of the new fstab, but perhaps then you try to edit/add the line from the old copy.
