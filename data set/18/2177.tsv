2010-08-17T19:05:00.000Z	storm_zen		Where is a good place to ask a question about encrypted partitions not booting?  In particular, /dev/disk/by-uuid seems to be missing.
2010-08-17T19:06:00.000Z	KE1HA	storm_zen	I think you just asked in a good place. If anyone knows the answer they will speak up Im sure.
2010-08-17T19:26:00.000Z	KE1HA	storm_zen	I saw ur post earlier, is this a widows ap, or linux app that did the PGP encrypt?
2010-08-17T19:28:00.000Z	storm_zen	KE1HA	... but not a partition encryption... a full disk encryption..
2010-08-17T19:28:00.000Z	KE1HA	storm_zen	ok, and you encrypted the partition Post UB installation ?
2010-08-17T19:29:00.000Z	KE1HA	storm_zen	I need to think on that one fer a bit, but I dont think you'll get through the encryption layer with a bootloader, but could be wrong.
2010-08-17T19:29:00.000Z	storm_zen	KE1HA	Would such a thing change the UUID of the partition?  That seems to be my issue.
2010-08-17T19:30:00.000Z	storm_zen	KE1HA	I had Karmic running successfully Linux encrypted partition + PGP Desktop full disk encryption on top of it.
2010-08-17T19:32:00.000Z	KE1HA	storm_zen	I'm not familiar with the app your referring too, I've not used it, nor can I see a reason for it, but that's here nor there. Can you use this windows app to remove this encryption ?
2010-08-17T19:33:00.000Z	storm_zen	KE1HA	In theory, yes.  But that's not my first choice:  It's a 10 hour commitment to do so.
2010-08-17T19:35:00.000Z	KE1HA	storm_zen	I can't tell you how Grub2 is reacting to the encryption layer, I just don't, and to try and fix this from within the Linux environment, make cause all sorts of issues. Many things have changed from Karmic to Lucid.
2010-08-17T19:37:00.000Z	storm_zen	KE1HA	I wasn't looking to make any changes other than config changes.  I wanted to see if I could figure out a way to manually boot into the partition... to start, where is it getting the UUID that is in the error message?
2010-08-17T19:38:00.000Z	storm_zen	KE1HA	I tried booting into rescue, but blkid returns nothing.
2010-08-17T19:38:00.000Z	KE1HA	storm_zen	My recommendation would be to go to the PGP Windows people and ask them how to fix the problem, as you asking Linux folks to understand what a Windows app is doing to a Linux machine :-) wow that's interesting.
2010-08-17T19:39:00.000Z	storm_zen	KE1HA	I'm not asking linux folks to understand PGP desktop... I'm asking which part of the boot process is out of synch on a linux machine.  Where is the broken connection?
2010-08-17T19:41:00.000Z	KE1HA	storm_zen	it seems the root cause was the secondardy encrypt, beyond that Im out of suggesitons.
2010-08-17T19:41:00.000Z	storm_zen	KE1HA	Fair enough.  Is there a channel for grub2?
2010-08-17T19:42:00.000Z	KE1HA	storm_zen	not a ubuntu channel no, seach the channel listing fer grub.
