2012-07-28T11:12:00.000Z	greenit		hi, my computer shows on every first start of the day a windows which tells me that my system is running in low graphics-mode, but the window is unclickable and i can't do anything.... when i restart, the system runs normally, and not in low graphics mode... can any1 help me to get rid of this problem? i have a nvidia gtx570 and the proprietary nvidia-driver
2012-07-28T11:14:00.000Z	Snowie	greenit	do you get the option to choose the os you want to boot on the restart (GRUB)?
2012-07-28T11:14:00.000Z	greenit	Snowie	yes#
2012-07-28T11:15:00.000Z	Snowie	greenit	but you dont get that on the boot that shows that window, right?
2012-07-28T11:15:00.000Z	greenit	Snowie	well, i boot the kernel which shows the window... but after a restart it works fine :S
2012-07-28T11:17:00.000Z	Snowie	greenit	ahh, so you always get the grub window. I had an issue where on every start i would get a black screen on boot. To fix i had to hold shift on start and boot into recovery mode, then restart from there, and all would be fine. Do you get different splash screens between your initial boot and your restart?
2012-07-28T11:18:00.000Z	greenit	Snowie	yeah, the first splash-screen looks like the normal 12.04 screen, the second, when i reboot, it looks like a crappy version of that
2012-07-28T11:20:00.000Z	Snowie	greenit	can you open a terminal, and post the output of $ lspci | grep VGA

2012-07-28T11:21:00.000Z	Snowie	greenit	ok. sec mate. i edited my GRUB file. So my boot always looks a bit dodgy (see all the gory details) but it works everytime. Let me find what i added
2012-07-28T11:21:00.000Z	greenit	Snowie	k :)
2012-07-28T11:28:00.000Z	Snowie	greenit	ok. how comfortable are you with GRUB?
2012-07-28T11:31:00.000Z	Snowie	greenit	if you know what i mean. try changing this line in grub GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="nomodeset=1"
2012-07-28T11:36:00.000Z	greenit	Snowie	sry, didnt read what u wrote to me, i found a wiki-article about nvidia-problems with ubuntu and wanted to test if that works, i added "nopat" to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX
2012-07-28T11:36:00.000Z	Snowie	greenit	np mate, did that work for you?
2012-07-28T11:36:00.000Z	greenit	Snowie	seems like yes, but i'll see it next time i start the computer for the first time^^
2012-07-28T11:37:00.000Z	Snowie	greenit	awesome. gl :)
2012-07-28T11:37:00.000Z	greenit	Snowie	thx :)
