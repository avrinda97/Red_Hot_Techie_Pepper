2008-02-24T02:06:00.000Z	nickrud	CorruptTerrorist	hm, what video card do you have
2008-02-24T02:08:00.000Z	nickrud	CorruptTerrorist	ah. clt-alt-f2, log in, run   sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg , hit enter for nearly everything, vesa as the driver, and 1024x768 and 800x600 for resolution. Then reboot
2008-02-24T02:09:00.000Z	CorruptTerrorist	nickrud	since i'm using wubi, do i hold it down while it's loading kernels?
2008-02-24T02:11:00.000Z	nickrud	CorruptTerrorist	oh, wubi. I have no idea what's gonna happen with an 8800gt and wubi, sorry.
2008-02-24T02:12:00.000Z	nickrud	CorruptTerrorist	the main issue is the 8800gt is too new to have full support from the ubuntu drivers, and I don't have a clue to how wubi gets itself running
2008-02-24T02:14:00.000Z	CorruptTerrorist	nickrud	when do i hold down ctrl+alt+f2 ?
2008-02-24T02:15:00.000Z	nickrud	CorruptTerrorist	press it when you see that error screen, it will give you a terminal to log into
2008-02-24T02:15:00.000Z	CorruptTerrorist	nickrud	ty for all your help. see you soon
2008-02-28T02:49:00.000Z	nickrud	CorruptTerrorist	the config files are in apache2-common , that's what you need to reinstall , maybe purge and install. If you have libapache2-mod-perl2 installed (that was you, wasn't it?) you need to that and libapache2-mod-php5 as well
2008-02-28T02:50:00.000Z	CorruptTerrorist	nickrud	how do i purge it?
2008-02-28T02:50:00.000Z	nickrud	CorruptTerrorist	in synaptic, mark for complete removal , or sudo apt-get remove --purge <packages>
