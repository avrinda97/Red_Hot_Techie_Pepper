2007-02-26T15:07:00.000Z	HeyGuy		so go complain!
2007-02-26T15:08:00.000Z	HeyGuy		:)
2007-02-26T15:09:00.000Z	HeyGuy		It's your legal right
2007-02-26T15:10:00.000Z	HeyGuy		how much does a vista OEM stand in? $100-200?
2007-02-26T15:10:00.000Z	AlexC_	HeyGuy	roughly yes,
2007-02-26T15:13:00.000Z	AlexC_	HeyGuy	no they can;t
2007-02-26T15:13:00.000Z	HeyGuy	AlexC_	 after danish law they can ;)
2007-02-26T15:14:00.000Z	AlexC_	HeyGuy	Take Dell for example. They have a closed deal with Microsoft so they get a Vista license for far less than we can. Dell can not tell us what they pay for it, because it's against the contract they made with Microsoft. So, as they can not give you a price for what they paid - you get the price of a full OEM
2007-02-26T15:14:00.000Z	AlexC_	HeyGuy	if they say "Well give you $10, that's what we paid" ... they will get in big trouble with Microsoft
2007-02-26T15:15:00.000Z	HeyGuy	AlexC_	yes, but they cant only pay 50% because 4. party software "paid" for the rest
2007-02-26T15:16:00.000Z	AlexC_	HeyGuy	the cost of a vista license is included in the laptop, if it's included in the price you get the price refunded.
2007-02-26T15:18:00.000Z	AlexC_	HeyGuy	it offers paid commercial support
2007-02-26T15:18:00.000Z	HeyGuy	AlexC_	 yes but theres no one that they can blame if everything goes to the shitter
2007-02-26T15:19:00.000Z	HeyGuy	AlexC_	there HP does only say that are talking to novel and redhat
2007-02-26T15:36:00.000Z	AlexC_	HeyGuy	no, there is a big bug with JMIcron IDE/SATA Controllers (found on many Core 2 Duo motherboards) that means Linux can not even boot or install.
2007-02-26T15:37:00.000Z	AlexC_	HeyGuy	it's belived to be fixed in the latest BIOS updates for a users motherboard,
2007-02-26T15:38:00.000Z	HeyGuy	AlexC_	really my mates core2doh works fine
2007-02-26T15:38:00.000Z	AlexC_	HeyGuy	oh yeah, some motherboards that have support for Core 2 Duo don't use the JMicron IDE/SATA Controller. So they will work fine, but many motherboards do have the JMIicron controller
