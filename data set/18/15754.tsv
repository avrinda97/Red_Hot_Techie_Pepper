2005-06-30T15:40:00.000Z	Vjaz	Stealth890	Try disabling apic.
2005-06-30T15:40:00.000Z	Vjaz	Stealth890	pass "noapic" to your kernel
2005-06-30T15:41:00.000Z	Vjaz	Stealth890	and maybe "nolapic" too
2005-06-30T15:41:00.000Z	Vjaz	Stealth890	when the computer boots up, you can interrupt it with ESC.
2005-06-30T15:41:00.000Z	Vjaz	Stealth890	then you'll get a menu with boot options
2005-06-30T15:43:00.000Z	Vjaz	Stealth890	yes
2005-06-30T15:43:00.000Z	Vjaz	Stealth890	yes, that one
2005-06-30T15:43:00.000Z	Vjaz	Stealth890	add noapic and nolapic at the end
2005-06-30T15:43:00.000Z	Vjaz	Stealth890	then press B to boot
2005-06-30T15:43:00.000Z	Vjaz	Stealth890	apic
2005-06-30T15:45:00.000Z	Vjaz	Stealth890	it didn't help?
2005-06-30T15:48:00.000Z	Vjaz	Stealth890	Just like we already did but instead of "noapic nolapic" put "acpi=force pci=noacpi" there in the end
