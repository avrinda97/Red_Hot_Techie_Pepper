2008-02-19T06:49:00.000Z	outsane		has anyone here installed virtualbox?
2008-02-19T06:50:00.000Z	jimcooncat	outsane	yes, but not at this location
2008-02-19T06:50:00.000Z	jimcooncat	outsane	I use it at work all the time
2008-02-19T06:50:00.000Z	outsane	jimcooncat	okay, i'm installing the .deb file, but how will i open virtualbox once the deb file is done?  i've never used a deb file before.
