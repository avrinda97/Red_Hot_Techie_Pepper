2005-07-10T13:50:00.000Z	poningru		I had question about canonical how does it provide funds? leach off of shuttleworth? or Support for Ubuntu?
2005-07-10T13:50:00.000Z	poningru		err generate funds would be better word
2005-07-10T13:52:00.000Z	poningru		any client using H.323 is fine
2005-07-10T13:52:00.000Z	poningru		so anyone had an answer to my question
2005-07-10T13:52:00.000Z	nickrud	poningru	I read once that canonical intends to make money teaching people to provide support for ubuntu installations, small and large.
2005-07-10T13:56:00.000Z	poningru	nickrud	are they not doing support themselves?
2005-07-10T13:57:00.000Z	nickrud	poningru	well, I get plenty of support myself, already. Just how they get my money, well, I guess I'll have to donate
2005-07-10T13:58:00.000Z	nickrud	poningru	really? I find that rather pleasing
2005-07-21T13:12:00.000Z	poningru	nickrud	no he has to put in password inorder to access the interweb
2005-07-27T11:32:00.000Z	nickrud	poningru	?
2005-07-27T11:33:00.000Z	poningru	nickrud	how else do you play realplayer in mplayer?
2005-07-27T11:33:00.000Z	nickrud	poningru	I just never thought of it as the 'crazy' plugin
2005-07-27T11:34:00.000Z	nickrud	poningru	now, you make me go try realplayer streams with mozilla-mplayer, so I can refresh my memory :)
2005-07-27T11:36:00.000Z	poningru	nickrud	let me know how it works out
2005-07-27T11:37:00.000Z	poningru	nickrud	do you have official realplayer installed?
2005-07-27T11:38:00.000Z	nickrud	poningru	of course
2005-07-27T11:38:00.000Z	nickrud	poningru	ah, a purist, you are :)
2007-12-23T06:45:00.000Z	nickrud	poningru	no, I was talking with Zoe_ earlier & couldn't help, don't know nvidia
