2007-01-20T11:55:00.000Z	uiiu		clabledevil: i don't know the anser to your problem - but it sounds like theres an automatic shutdown program
2007-01-20T11:55:00.000Z	uiiu		shutdown is a command, you may want to try man shutdown for more info
2007-01-20T11:56:00.000Z	uiiu		cabledevil: there's a command you can use in terminal "shutdown", that i /think\ can be used to set up automatic shutdown times. you may want to try "man shutdown" to read the manual page on it. because there may be a way to reset, or UNset the shudown
2007-01-20T11:56:00.000Z	mwe	uiiu	I have never heard of automagic shutdown on a default install, though
2007-01-20T11:57:00.000Z	uiiu	mwe	netiher have i, but it's all i can think of
2007-01-20T11:57:00.000Z	uiiu	mwe	my default install didn't allow the floppy to be written to, i had to manually edit fstab, go figure...
2007-01-20T12:16:00.000Z	uiiu	mwe	how do you make it so it's not 'busy'...are there processes to kill or something?
2007-01-20T12:17:00.000Z	mwe	uiiu	close open files on the drive
2007-01-20T12:17:00.000Z	mwe	uiiu	for cd drives you can use the 'eject' command
2007-01-20T12:17:00.000Z	uiiu	mwe	thanks, i was trying to use top the day but it was greek to me...
2007-01-20T12:20:00.000Z	mwe	uiiu	you probably want to use lsof to show open files
2007-01-20T12:20:00.000Z	mwe	uiiu	you can grep for the mount point
2007-01-20T12:21:00.000Z	uiiu	mwe	awesome, didn't know about lsof either (thanks). lots of output, greps a good idea, i wonder if there are any switches to use too? <'man-ing' losf>
2007-01-20T12:22:00.000Z	mwe	uiiu	there are dozens ;)
2007-01-20T12:25:00.000Z	mwe	uiiu	lsof /dev/hda1 or similar might be useful as well
2007-01-20T12:28:00.000Z	uiiu	mwe	gave lsof /dev/hd1 a shot, and i got an error message...about 'can't stat file system (ext 3)'...what's that about?
2007-01-20T12:33:00.000Z	mwe	uiiu	not sure. try sudo lsof, though
2007-01-20T12:35:00.000Z	uiiu	mwe	good call :)
