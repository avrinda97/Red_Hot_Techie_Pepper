2008-01-16T04:24:00.000Z	Grammaticus		Does anyone know of a simplified word processor for Ubuntu? Something similar to 'wordpad'?
2008-01-16T04:24:00.000Z	lusepuster	Grammaticus	Abiword is too bloated for you?
2008-01-16T04:24:00.000Z	Grammaticus	lusepuster	Supposedly I can't install Abiword on my machine -- some sort of conflict.
2008-01-16T04:25:00.000Z	lusepuster	Grammaticus	what does it say in the error message?
2008-01-16T04:26:00.000Z	Grammaticus	lusepuster	I am on Windows now since I cannot connect to the internet on Ubuntu at the moment -- I have an internal dial-up modem. I'll read it an log back on.
2008-01-16T04:27:00.000Z	lusepuster	Grammaticus	okay
2008-01-16T04:37:00.000Z	Grammaticus	lusepuster	AbiWord cannot be installed on your computer (i386). Either the application requires special hardware features or the vendor decided to not support your computer type.
2008-01-16T04:38:00.000Z	lusepuster	Grammaticus	where did you download it?
2008-01-16T04:38:00.000Z	Grammaticus	lusepuster	from the 'Add/Remove' programmes list.
2008-01-16T04:39:00.000Z	lusepuster	Grammaticus	are you running an 64bit ubuntu or smthn?
2008-01-16T04:39:00.000Z	Grammaticus	lusepuster	32-bit, I presume.
2008-01-16T04:40:00.000Z	lusepuster	Grammaticus	what is your processor type?
2008-01-16T04:40:00.000Z	Grammaticus	lusepuster	perhaps I have to be connected to the net?
2008-01-16T04:40:00.000Z	lusepuster	Grammaticus	yes you will, it is not on the install CD
2008-01-16T04:41:00.000Z	lusepuster	Grammaticus	That could very well be the problem
2008-01-16T04:41:00.000Z	Grammaticus	lusepuster	ah, I see. I'll have to wait until I purchase my external modem -- granted the internal simply does not work.
2008-01-16T04:42:00.000Z	Grammaticus	lusepuster	thanks for the assistance.
2008-01-16T04:42:00.000Z	lusepuster	Grammaticus	YW
