2008-01-15T04:56:00.000Z	acidfire2008		can someone tell me how u ssh to another server pc from ubuntu?
2008-01-15T04:56:00.000Z	neverblue	acidfire2008	ssh host
2008-01-15T04:56:00.000Z	neverblue	acidfire2008	ip usually helps
2008-01-15T04:57:00.000Z	neverblue	acidfire2008	is that service (sshd) running on the computer your attempting to connect to ?
2008-01-15T04:57:00.000Z	neverblue	acidfire2008	is this on your LAN ?
2008-01-15T04:58:00.000Z	neverblue	acidfire2008	 then you need to type: ssh host in a terminal
2008-01-15T04:59:00.000Z	neverblue	acidfire2008	 ssh host (thats it)
2008-01-15T04:59:00.000Z	neverblue	acidfire2008	does the EXACT same thing it does in putty
2008-01-15T05:01:00.000Z	neverblue	acidfire2008	with so many posts in the channel, its beneficial for you to post the users nick, at the beginning of your reply, so someone knows who you are talking to
2008-01-15T05:02:00.000Z	neverblue	acidfire2008	please read my two previous posts, before replying anymore
2008-01-15T05:02:00.000Z	neverblue	acidfire2008	can you ping the host ?
2008-01-15T05:02:00.000Z	neverblue	acidfire2008	ping IP
2008-01-15T05:05:00.000Z	acidfire2008	neverblue	it asks for a password not a login
2008-01-15T05:05:00.000Z	neverblue	acidfire2008	its using your username on your system
2008-01-15T05:06:00.000Z	neverblue	acidfire2008	press enter, it will prompt for a username, then a password
2008-01-15T05:07:00.000Z	neverblue	acidfire2008	thats the last time I am posting that into to you
2008-01-15T05:07:00.000Z	neverblue	acidfire2008	ssh user@host
2008-01-15T05:08:00.000Z	neverblue	acidfire2008	i cannot be of any further assistance to you, good luck
