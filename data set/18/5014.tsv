2009-01-02T00:27:00.000Z	josher4		I have a drive that has one big partition that fills up the drive (ntfs). It has some data on it that I would like to save but I do not believe I can fit on my computer. Can the partition program in the live CD (The one you can use when you try Ubuntu) resize this so it is smaller so I can put linux on it? The drive is external and the data that is in the partition takes up a very small part...
2009-01-02T00:27:00.000Z	josher4		...of it.
2009-01-02T00:28:00.000Z	jtaji	josher4	would it be a problem if you lost this data?
2009-01-02T00:29:00.000Z	josher4	jtaji	Not a major problem. It is just downloaded programs.
2009-01-02T00:29:00.000Z	josher4	jtaji	It would take a long time to get them back though.
2009-01-02T00:32:00.000Z	jtaji	josher4	you can certainly resize it, a backup is highly recommended so you'll have to determine if you want to skip that step ;)
2009-01-02T00:33:00.000Z	josher4	jtaji	What are the probabilities of me permanently loosing my data?
2009-01-02T00:34:00.000Z	jtaji	josher4	low, still partitioning is one of the riskier operations
2009-01-02T00:35:00.000Z	josher4	jtaji	Well, I have redone the drive like 10 times. Never re sized though.
2009-01-02T00:48:00.000Z	josher4	jtaji	Ok, now after I resize and I put ubuntu in the free space that I have created, will windows just recognize the ntfs partition and use it like it is now?
2009-01-02T00:49:00.000Z	jtaji	josher4	it will, actually the ubuntu install will set up it's boot loader to be able to boot windows
2009-01-02T00:50:00.000Z	josher4	jtaji	What?
2009-01-02T00:50:00.000Z	josher4	jtaji	Windows is on my internal drive
2009-01-02T00:51:00.000Z	jtaji	josher4	yes windows will only recognize the ntfs partition
2009-01-02T00:51:00.000Z	jtaji	josher4	it might suggest a disk check after resizing
2009-01-02T00:53:00.000Z	josher4	jtaji	Ok, because I had windows ignore the drive completely before an I couldnt even see it in the My comp. window.
2009-01-02T00:53:00.000Z	josher4	jtaji	Now when the chkdisk window or suggestion thing pops up, do I tell it not to?
2009-01-04T01:31:00.000Z	jtaji	josher4	what version ubuntu are you running?
