2010-01-17T16:38:00.000Z	Quadrescence	RS-232	mv -R will MOVE the directory
2010-01-17T16:38:00.000Z	Quadrescence		use cp -R to COPY it
2010-01-17T16:38:00.000Z	RS-232	Quadrescence	-R does not work for MV command
2010-01-17T16:38:00.000Z	Quadrescence	RS-232	Yes it does
2010-01-17T16:39:00.000Z	RS-232		WebTool:/var/www/sites/all/modules# mv -R cacheexclude 3rd\ party/
2010-01-17T16:39:00.000Z	RS-232		mv: invalid option -- R
2010-01-17T16:39:00.000Z	RS-232		Try `mv --help' for more information.
2010-01-17T16:39:00.000Z	RS-232		?
2010-01-17T16:39:00.000Z	RS-232		mv: invalid option -- r
2010-01-17T16:39:00.000Z	RS-232		-r does not work either
2010-01-17T16:40:00.000Z	RS-232		I can copy them, but I want to know how to move them (erasing the origin)
2010-01-17T16:40:00.000Z	Quadrescence	RS-232	I was wrong, -R isn't an option. You probably want cp though, or mv -f
2010-01-17T16:40:00.000Z	RS-232	Quadrescence	so for directories only CP works? no MV?
2010-01-17T16:41:00.000Z	Quadrescence	RS-232	Try mv -f
