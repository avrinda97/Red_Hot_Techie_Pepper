2006-09-03T14:34:00.000Z	gnomefreak	DangerousK	i am not warning you again to watch your language and shortening it or using other chars is not a way around it
2006-09-03T14:36:00.000Z	gnomefreak	DangerousK	what seems to be the problem you are having?
2006-09-03T14:37:00.000Z	gnomefreak	DangerousK	installing from same disk? and what is the user name you are using?
2006-09-03T14:38:00.000Z	gnomefreak	DangerousK	its fixed in the 6.06.1 live cd iirc
2006-09-03T14:38:00.000Z	gnomefreak	DangerousK	yes
2006-09-03T14:38:00.000Z	gnomefreak	DangerousK	use a different name
2006-09-03T14:39:00.000Z	gnomefreak	DangerousK	is it running in a loop or the install finishes and you cant log in
