2005-02-01T12:21:00.000Z	HappyFool		can you maybe use nautilus for this?
2005-02-01T12:21:00.000Z	Stew2	HappyFool	That's what I meant.
2005-02-01T12:23:00.000Z	Stew2	HappyFool	You're right, but if the 'admin' account I'm logged in as doesn't have the priveledge of changing other account's folders, how do I affect that change?
2005-02-01T12:23:00.000Z	Stew2	HappyFool	If I was logged in interactively as root, this would be easy.
2005-02-01T12:26:00.000Z	Stew2	HappyFool	Just general administrative file management stuff. I don't want them to have to drop to a terminal to act as root when changing permissions, etc. I'd like them to be able to do that through the file mangler, in this case, nautilus.
2005-02-01T12:26:00.000Z	Stew2	HappyFool	It's not that they don't understand the gravity of what they are doing by changing permissions, they are human beings. They're just not programmers and not used to having to do anything from the command line.
2005-02-01T12:27:00.000Z	Stew2	HappyFool	They are already enthusiastic about Ubuntu and linux/open source in general. I'm helping there enthusiasm.
2005-02-01T12:28:00.000Z	HappyFool	Stew2	look for some on-line tuts for "introduction to linux". try en.tldp.org. and, if the machines are networked, consider running sshd so you can shell in to do admin
2005-02-01T12:30:00.000Z	Stew2	HappyFool	I'll be in sweden. These machines are behind a router and I don't have port forwarding turned on. I'm showing how they can 'sudo nautilus'. If they screw it up, stick the install cd in from the distro and start over (and don't do whatever you did again, or ask first on google/linux or #ubuntu)
2005-02-01T12:31:00.000Z	HappyFool	Stew2	gksudo should make it easy for the user to go to Nautilus as superuser -- no terminals needed
2005-02-01T12:33:00.000Z	HappyFool	Stew2	go Applications->System Tools->Root terminal (but don't left click!) -> Properties
2005-02-01T13:49:00.000Z	Stew2	HappyFool	How do I make sure additional users are able to SUDO?
2005-02-01T13:54:00.000Z	HappyFool	Stew2	i think those are user names (?)
2005-02-01T13:56:00.000Z	HappyFool	Stew2	try man sudoers   -- oh, it's in EBNF. goodness.
2005-02-01T13:59:00.000Z	HappyFool	Stew2	this probably isn't good advice, but I would just add lines similar to those in there, substituing the appropriate user names
2005-02-01T14:03:00.000Z	HappyFool	Stew2	try EDITOR=myfavouriteeditor visudo /etc/sudoers
