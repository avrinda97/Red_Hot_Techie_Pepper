2006-08-03T08:36:00.000Z	AngryElf		guys, tell me if this has been done already:  i'd like to modify a liveCD so that it connects to my home server over the www via static ip, boots up amarok and loads my mp3 collection -- so i can have it from anywhere, is this feasible?
2006-08-03T08:37:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	AngryElf	are you talking about making a live cd based on ubuntu that accesses your computer from anywhere to listen to musci?
2006-08-03T08:37:00.000Z	AngryElf	DJAdmiral	basically
2006-08-03T08:38:00.000Z	AngryElf	DJAdmiral	i noticed there's a wiki on modifying the liveCD, or creating a new one, i was gonna use that for help
2006-08-03T08:38:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	AngryElf	i suppose you could just change start up options in the CD or something maybe.
2006-08-03T08:38:00.000Z	AngryElf	DJAdmiral	longwave, i think the wiki has good explanation of making the liveCD, my main question is, what's the best way to mount/share files over the www, and clearly, be secure
2006-08-03T08:39:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	AngryElf	erm, my best guess is Apache.
2006-08-03T08:39:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	AngryElf	then again I never really created a music server lol
2006-08-03T08:41:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	AngryElf	hmm i have an idea. you could possibly set up an apache server on your computer, and embed all your mp3 files into an html page.
2006-08-03T09:04:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	AngryElf	FTP server plus openssh
2006-08-03T09:04:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	AngryElf	XAMPP could probably do that for you
2006-08-03T09:05:00.000Z	AngryElf	DJAdmiral	longwave sorry, too many channels, i thought you all were in ##linux, sorry for asking you twice :)
2006-08-03T09:11:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	AngryElf	nl.archive.ubuntu.com
2006-08-03T09:11:00.000Z	AngryElf	DJAdmiral	how do i change it?
2006-08-03T09:12:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	AngryElf	you need to edit your sources.list file for that.
2006-08-03T09:12:00.000Z	AngryElf	DJAdmiral	nm
2006-08-03T09:16:00.000Z	AngryElf	DJAdmiral	are there other mirrors? that one reports it doesn't have all the packages
2006-08-03T09:16:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	AngryElf	you could replace the two letters up in front with your country code. like nl = netherlands, us = united states etc.
