2009-07-30T14:19:00.000Z	grom358		I have an ASUS P5QC motherboard. I already have it setup with RAID 0 using the onboard ICH10R chipset with Windows installed. The ubuntu installer is not detecting this RAID. Is there anyway I can get it to?
2009-07-30T14:19:00.000Z	nevyn	grom358	the ICH10R isn't a real raid controller..
2009-07-30T14:19:00.000Z	grom358	nevyn	yeah I am aware of that
2009-07-30T14:20:00.000Z	nevyn	grom358	it's possible but highly unlikely there's a driver for linux to talk it's disk format etc.
2009-07-30T14:20:00.000Z	grom358	nevyn	well I managed to use gparted live cd with it.. just not sure how to go about getting ubuntu to work with it
2009-07-30T14:21:00.000Z	nevyn	grom358	if you have had linux talk to it then you might be in luck with the installer.
2009-07-30T14:22:00.000Z	grom358	nevyn	okay.. I don't know what todo next though
2009-07-30T14:22:00.000Z	nevyn	grom358	so if you boot an ubuntu in livecd mode it sees the volumes?
2009-07-30T14:23:00.000Z	grom358	nevyn	no ubuntu doesn't see the RAID on it
2009-07-30T14:23:00.000Z	grom358	nevyn	gparted live cd does though.. so I take it linux can work with it
2009-07-30T14:24:00.000Z	grom358	nevyn	correct.. ubuntu out of the box is not seeing it
2009-07-30T14:31:00.000Z	grom358	nevyn	I got it working by following https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FakeRaidHowto
2009-07-30T14:32:00.000Z	nevyn	grom358	neato.
2009-07-30T14:32:00.000Z	grom358	nevyn	now I just got to work out what partitions I need for linux
2009-07-30T14:35:00.000Z	nevyn	grom358	~10-20 gig for / and /home as big as you feel sensible
2009-07-30T14:37:00.000Z	nevyn	grom358	if you insist on doing / /var /var/core /opt /usr /home/ etc stupid... then for gods sake use lvm, start with them smallish and expand as required but it's a giant pita so just don't
2009-07-30T14:37:00.000Z	nevyn	grom358	home's a good idea.. because then you can blow away the system without blowing away all your data.
2009-07-30T14:38:00.000Z	nevyn	grom358	seperate partition != backups.. but if you're good with that.. then whatever
