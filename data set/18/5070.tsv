2008-12-21T22:23:00.000Z	rohil		hi guys...downloaded 8.10 iso image, and burnt it into a cd using nero on windows XP ...but vista does not read it ? any ideas ?
2008-12-21T22:24:00.000Z	ikonia	rohil	why would vista read it ?
2008-12-21T22:24:00.000Z	ikonia	rohil	the cd is a compressed boot iso
2008-12-21T22:24:00.000Z	ikonia	rohil	you boot from it
2008-12-21T22:24:00.000Z	rohil	ikonia	the cd is for vista on my laptop. It shows all its 700 mb is free
2008-12-21T22:25:00.000Z	ikonia	rohil	then it's not burnt
2008-12-21T22:25:00.000Z	rohil	ikonia	the image is being detected and run well by windows XP
2008-12-21T22:26:00.000Z	ikonia	rohil	what are you talking about?? you said you wanted to burn it, yet it's not burnt
2008-12-21T22:27:00.000Z	rohil	ikonia	I wanted to 1>Burn the iso image into a CD 2>Use the CD to install Ubuntu 8.10 3>The CD is not being detected by windows vista
2008-12-21T22:27:00.000Z	ikonia	rohil	the cd is blank thats why isn't it ?
2008-12-21T22:27:00.000Z	ikonia	rohil	you've not burnt it yet
2008-12-21T22:27:00.000Z	rohil	ikonia	I burnt the Image into the CD through my desktop and the image is being read from the CD on my desktop's XP
2008-12-21T22:28:00.000Z	ikonia	rohil	so it's probably a vista/nero issue then
2008-12-21T22:28:00.000Z	rohil	ikonia	ohk. sad. Any universal way sure to work ? already wasted two cds
2008-12-21T22:28:00.000Z	ikonia	rohil	bope
2009-01-14T16:18:00.000Z	ikonia	rohil	normal default is about 2GB
2009-01-14T16:21:00.000Z	ikonia	rohil	show us the output of df -h in a pastebin please, a default ubuntu 8.10 install is about 2GB
2009-01-14T16:23:00.000Z	ikonia	rohil	you either have a big file on that disk, such as a video file or you've installed a lot of packages
