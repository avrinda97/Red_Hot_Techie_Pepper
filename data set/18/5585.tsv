2010-05-02T17:57:00.000Z	TDJACR		I would like to restore the partitions
2010-05-02T17:57:00.000Z	penguin42	TDJACR	Explain the structure of filesystems/RAID you built
2010-05-02T17:59:00.000Z	TDJACR	penguin42	(md0-md2) were all created when the system was created, fresh with ext4 filesystems. Using sd[ac][123] They're fine.
2010-05-02T17:59:00.000Z	TDJACR	penguin42	md3, was created later, using two identical partitions with data and an ext4 FS
2010-05-02T17:59:00.000Z	penguin42	TDJACR	And then you just created the ext4fs on /dev/md3 ?
2010-05-02T17:59:00.000Z	TDJACR	penguin42	No
2010-05-02T18:00:00.000Z	TDJACR	penguin42	It already existed
2010-05-02T18:00:00.000Z	penguin42	TDJACR	No, that's not how RAID/md works - you create a special block device from two others, and then create the filesystem on top
2010-05-02T18:00:00.000Z	TDJACR	penguin42	I understand that now :P
2010-05-02T18:03:00.000Z	TDJACR	penguin42	Am I done, or is there a way to rectify this.
2010-05-02T18:22:00.000Z	TDJACR	penguin42	what are my options
2010-05-02T18:22:00.000Z	penguin42	TDJACR	To get your data back off the filesystem that was there or to start again?
2010-05-02T18:23:00.000Z	TDJACR	penguin42	The former
2010-05-02T18:23:00.000Z	penguin42	TDJACR	It depends exactly what you did, if it did a raid resync over the side with the data then it will have completely erased it, the best case is that it's only erased some headeers and the rest might be recoverable
2010-05-02T18:24:00.000Z	TDJACR	penguin42	It ran for about a minute or so before iI stopped it
2010-05-02T18:24:00.000Z	penguin42	TDJACR	I've never used them but you could try the 'testdisk' package - it's supposed to be able to recover some stuff; remember on a fast disk a minute represents about 6GB of data!
2010-05-02T18:26:00.000Z	TDJACR	penguin42	I don't think it supports ext4. I did a fsck on one of the drives, and it recovered a lot, put it put them into lost+found with no structure
2010-05-02T18:27:00.000Z	penguin42	TDJACR	I think it's more likely that a lot of the structure has just gone
