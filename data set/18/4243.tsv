2009-05-14T06:34:00.000Z	vertix		do I have to verify MD5 if I downloaded via torrent?
2009-05-14T06:34:00.000Z	blizzkid_	vertix	verifying md5 is *always* best practice
2009-05-14T06:59:00.000Z	blizzkid_	vertix	depends on what applications and hardware you run
2009-05-14T07:00:00.000Z	vertix	blizzkid_	I thought everybody support 64 bit apps nowadays
2009-05-14T07:00:00.000Z	blizzkid_	vertix	not exactly... most apps will work, but some drivers might fail, and flash still doesn't work
2009-05-14T07:01:00.000Z	vertix	blizzkid_	my main app is written in Java, so I need compiler that runs 64 bit. then I need something like dreamweaver for article page design and that is enough for now
2009-05-14T07:02:00.000Z	vertix	blizzkid_	oh even DRIVERS might fail? that doesn't soon very exciting
2009-05-14T07:02:00.000Z	blizzkid_	vertix	I don't think that'll be an issue
2009-05-14T07:02:00.000Z	blizzkid_	vertix	most drivers will work fine
2009-05-14T07:02:00.000Z	blizzkid_	vertix	only one way to find out: test it :)
2009-05-14T07:05:00.000Z	vertix	blizzkid_	well the reason I am saying it is because i started download of i386 and then moved torrent to other dir in the middle of download. It did not complain and continue. but when I came back several hours later, it was still downloading like it did not make any progress. so I though of using 64 bit kernel which I already downloaded
2009-05-14T07:06:00.000Z	blizzkid_	vertix	I'd just give it a go
2009-05-14T07:06:00.000Z	blizzkid_	vertix	obviously :)
2009-05-14T07:07:00.000Z	blizzkid_	vertix	it'd be like telling you to pick up a book in aisle 5 of the library, and while you're walking I'd move it to ailse 3...
2009-05-14T07:14:00.000Z	vertix	blizzkid_	i moved torrent and .iso file while I PAUSED download, so I thought file descriptor would get closed and when I move these files to a different location and restart, it would reopen files. Files WERE actually moved ok, and when I restarted transmission, it did not complain about missing torrent and continued OK, so I thought there is no problem, but it did not seem to have made any progress with download, so I am kinda confused w
2009-05-14T07:14:00.000Z	vertix	blizzkid_	what should I do
2009-05-14T07:14:00.000Z	blizzkid_	vertix	I'd just give the 64 bit a go
2009-05-14T07:15:00.000Z	vertix	blizzkid_	but what to do with that torrent that i moved? and that .iso file? should I just forget about it and delete it?
