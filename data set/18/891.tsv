2011-08-05T14:25:00.000Z	nqs		hi peeps.  I'm trying to create a 3+1 raid 10 device in ubutu server (inside a VM)  I create the raid device with the installer, but once created I don't see the device.  how can I access it?
2011-08-05T14:26:00.000Z	OmegaForte	nqs	Are you trying to create a HAL layer, or are you making a virtual raid in the vm...
2011-08-05T14:29:00.000Z	nqs	OmegaForte	i'm not sure.  trying to learn raid, i heard ubuntu is easier.  so far that is false.   but I have 1 64mb /boot device and 4 756mb sas raid devices.  I'd expect to see the raid device so i can create partitions within it, yet I onl[y see the physical devices.  when I try to continue it tells me i don't have a root file system
2011-08-05T14:30:00.000Z	OmegaForte	nqs	Raid requires hardware. If you're making an LVS system, you're gonna have to do it from OUTSIDE of the virtual machine, and it will only be visible in Linux.
2011-08-05T14:32:00.000Z	OmegaForte	nqs	and you don't make a raid array inside an operating system. You do it from the raid controller's firmware during boot, or with their specific mananger inside a supported operatic system.
2011-08-05T14:32:00.000Z	nqs	OmegaForte	ok, maybe i'm confused.  are you saying that mdadm is dependent on having a hardwore controller?
2011-08-05T14:34:00.000Z	OmegaForte	nqs	All raid, except LVS is hardware, home skillet. mdadm controls software raid. Something you won't get performance out of. Raid controllers have specific hardware to make them actually do their job. Doing things over software can slow things down far more than you'd expect.
2011-08-05T14:35:00.000Z	nqs	OmegaForte	i may be assuming that the base system can be isntalled to a mdadm device.  is this incorrect?
2011-08-05T14:36:00.000Z	OmegaForte	nqs	I wouldn't do it. Software raid doesn't reflect performance, and in some cases, stability. Raid in it's own is to either gain SPEED in the absense of lifetime, or the gain of RELIABILITY in the absense of speed. No point in software raid unless you're just spanning.
2011-08-05T14:37:00.000Z	nqs	OmegaForte	i use hardvare raid in my old file server.  i'll agree it's better in most cases, but in my case, the controller is so old if it dies, assuming i could find another (ok, i do have 2 spares...) the softwore to access it is no longer avadiable.   software raid would solve that problem
2011-08-05T14:38:00.000Z	OmegaForte	nqs	with a huge trade-off of the file system not being transplantable, re-scalable or performing within normal disk standards, let alone with a controller.
2011-08-05T14:40:00.000Z	nqs	OmegaForte	as an aside, are you familiar at all with raidZ on linux?  i'm trying to emulate a system i'm considering with 2 raid arrays, and for the second i'm trying to decide between raid 5, raid 6 and raid z
2011-08-05T14:40:00.000Z	OmegaForte	nqs	I just do hardware raid man. I'm not going to risk drives on sofware raid.
2011-08-05T14:41:00.000Z	nqs	OmegaForte	I should note the OS most likely won't be ubuntu, nor debian based
2011-08-05T14:41:00.000Z	OmegaForte	nqs	Then you're out of my spectrum in distro's too.
2011-08-05T14:42:00.000Z	nqs	OmegaForte	like I said, i only tried it because every one said it was fast and easy.   it's taken me about 4x longer to get to this point as it does to do a complete gentoo install
2011-08-05T14:43:00.000Z	OmegaForte	nqs	That's why hardware exists to do this job. No software is faster.
2011-08-05T14:44:00.000Z	nqs	OmegaForte	well, thanks for the help
