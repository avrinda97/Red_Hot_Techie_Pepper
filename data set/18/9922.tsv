2007-02-03T14:58:00.000Z	Randomtime		NeoMatrix:What format can I save it as so it can be read in text format on windows?
2007-02-03T14:59:00.000Z	NeoMatrixJR24	Randomtime	if you: cat dmesg > some_file.rtf and take it to windows, MS word should open it properly
2007-02-03T15:04:00.000Z	NeoMatrixJR24	Randomtime	just please, for heaven's sake tell me you know about pastebin or nopaste and aren't going to paste it in here! :D
2007-02-03T15:14:00.000Z	NeoMatrixJR24	Randomtime	wow...there's so many floppy errors that you're USB errors have been wiped off the file.  Are you haveing trouble with ALL USB devices or just drives, etc? (also, please respong w/ my full name in the message. my client will alert me to your response that way)
2007-02-03T15:15:00.000Z	Randomtime	NeoMatrixJR24	It's all usb devices, drives, mice etc
2007-02-03T15:15:00.000Z	NeoMatrixJR24	Randomtime	did it work before, or has it never worked?
2007-02-03T15:17:00.000Z	NeoMatrixJR24	Randomtime	what type of computer are you using? and which version of ubuntu?
2007-02-03T15:19:00.000Z	Randomtime	NeoMatrixJR24	ubuntu 6.06, I'm using a time PC that came out in the early days of XP, I can't remember the accual model number and I can't find it on the computer
2007-02-03T15:19:00.000Z	Randomtime	NeoMatrixJR24	I have 4 USB ports and none work
2007-02-03T15:20:00.000Z	NeoMatrixJR24	Randomtime	do you know what type of chipset it has controling the USB? (VIA, INTEL, etc)  or if there's any way you can restart the system and get me a fresh dmesg w/o all the floppy errs I can help.  I think ububtu just doesn't recognize your usb
2007-02-03T15:20:00.000Z	Randomtime	NeoMatrixJR24	Ok i'll reboot
2007-02-03T15:23:00.000Z	Randomtime	NeoMatrixJR24	BIOS says onchip USB controler, I'm rebooting

2007-02-03T15:33:00.000Z	NeoMatrixJR24	Randomtime	got it...checking
2007-02-03T15:40:00.000Z	NeoMatrixJR24	Randomtime	I don't see anything dealing with loading a USB driver (host controller).  It's possible that your USB is damaged, or not recognized by ubuntu.
2007-02-03T15:40:00.000Z	NeoMatrixJR24	Randomtime	You could possibly check with someone else how you might try and recompile your kernel with proper drivers for your system, or add a recognizable usb controller
2007-02-03T15:41:00.000Z	NeoMatrixJR24	Randomtime	I'm not too clear on rebuilding a ubuntu kernel yet, so I won't be much help there
