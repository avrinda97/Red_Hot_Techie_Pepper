2009-08-22T20:46:00.000Z	Chris220	stefg	Maybe that's not what I'm looking for then... I just installed an nVidia driver and it said I would have to change a few lines in my "X Config" or something... something about xorg
2009-08-22T20:47:00.000Z	stefg	Chris220	did you have a particulr reason not to use the driver supplied with ubuntu?
2009-08-22T20:47:00.000Z	Chris220		I was told to install a Legacy driver from the nVidia website
2009-08-22T20:47:00.000Z	Chris220		Because I was having problems with Blender
2009-08-22T20:47:00.000Z	stefg	Chris220	what version of ubuntu do you run ?
2009-08-22T20:48:00.000Z	Chris220	stefg	9.04
2009-08-22T20:48:00.000Z	stefg	Chris220	and what nvidia card do you have ?
2009-08-22T20:48:00.000Z	stefg	Chris220	lspci | grep VGA
2009-08-22T20:48:00.000Z	Chris220	stefg	:RIVA TNT2 Model 64 (old, I know)
2009-08-22T20:50:00.000Z	Chris220	stefg	Output from that command gives me "nVidia Corporation NV5M64 [RIVA TNT2 Model 64/Model 64 Pro] (rev 15)"
2009-08-22T20:50:00.000Z	stefg	Chris220	Nvidia dropped support for the -legacy driver for newer xorg versions. the last version of ubuntu having 3D support for that card is 8.04 hardy. No way of getting 3D to work in jaubty for that card
2009-08-22T20:51:00.000Z	Chris220	stefg	Well it worked, it just was very slow
2009-08-22T20:51:00.000Z	stefg	Chris220	because it was using the software emuation
2009-08-22T20:51:00.000Z	Chris220		Ah I see
2009-08-22T20:51:00.000Z	Chris220	stefg	Ok, if that's the case, how can I remove this driver I've just installed? I don't want it lying around uselessly
2009-08-22T20:53:00.000Z	stefg	Chris220	usually you run the nvidia-*.run file with a -uninstall switch. But that's the problem with programs bypassing the package management... you never know how to get rid of them again
2009-08-22T20:54:00.000Z	Chris220	stefg	Ok, I guess I have to redownload it then X_X
