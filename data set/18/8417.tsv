2007-08-23T06:06:00.000Z	alexbOrsova		wow I totally guessed that
2007-08-23T06:06:00.000Z	alexbOrsova		ok, go for it
2007-08-23T06:08:00.000Z	alexbOrsova		codemastermm, it looks like it tries to start samba before reinstalling it
2007-08-23T06:08:00.000Z	alexbOrsova		of course that fails so apparently it gives up on reinstalling it
2007-08-23T06:09:00.000Z	alexbOrsova		of course if it didn't fail maybe the reinstall might work
2007-08-23T06:09:00.000Z	alexbOrsova		so I think you need to get a sample samba config file
2007-08-23T06:09:00.000Z	alexbOrsova		for the one you modified
2007-08-23T06:09:00.000Z	alexbOrsova		or look for the backup (you know, with the ~)
2007-08-23T06:10:00.000Z	alexbOrsova		this channel sucks you in

2007-08-23T06:13:00.000Z	alexbOrsova	bulmer	'so?': it doesn't encourage repeat use
