2008-10-22T21:40:00.000Z	sfears		hello, having problems with my dvd player recognizing dvd medium that's inserted in the tray, plays cds fine.  Any help??
2008-10-22T21:40:00.000Z	Kr0ntab	sfears	what media are you trying to work with?  video dvd's?  data dvd's?
2008-10-22T21:42:00.000Z	Kr0ntab	sfears	commercial dvd's?
2008-10-22T21:42:00.000Z	Kr0ntab	sfears	if so... have you installed libdvdcss2?  it's a library that allows you to decrypt retail DVD's...
2008-10-22T21:45:00.000Z	sfears	Kr0ntab	not sure if it means anything, but the light on my player stays solid while there's a dvd in.. i try to "sudo mount /dev/sdb /media/mnt" and i get a "no medium found error"
2008-10-22T21:45:00.000Z	Kr0ntab	sfears	yeah that's weird... it sounds like drive issue?
2008-10-22T21:47:00.000Z	Kr0ntab	sfears	that would be my assumption.  yeah... when you insert the disk... look at /var/log/syslog and /var/log/messages
2008-10-22T21:47:00.000Z	Kr0ntab	sfears	it will give you info about read errors... or other useful info...
2008-10-22T21:52:00.000Z	sfears	Kr0ntab	is there something in particular i can grep.. i'm not sure what to do with all the information in that output
2008-10-22T21:53:00.000Z	Kr0ntab	sfears	sorry mate.  yeah... just do a tail -f /var/log/syslog  and in another terminal... tail -f /var/log/messages
2008-10-22T21:53:00.000Z	Kr0ntab	sfears	so when you load the DVD in the drive... you should see messages that might mean something...
2008-10-22T21:55:00.000Z	sfears	Kr0ntab	i only see a bunch of stuff about pcmcia & my wireless networks
2008-10-22T21:56:00.000Z	Kr0ntab	sfears	do CD's work?
2008-10-22T21:56:00.000Z	Kr0ntab	sfears	yeah, then i'm not sure mate.
2008-10-22T21:57:00.000Z	sfears	Kr0ntab	do you know somewhere i might be able to get some more help on my DVD issue?
2008-10-22T21:58:00.000Z	Kr0ntab	sfears	that one is commented out...  do you have an entry in fstab about a /dev/scd0 ?
