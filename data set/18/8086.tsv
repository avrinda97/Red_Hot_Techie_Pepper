2007-10-02T09:17:00.000Z	sanrag		hi ...can anyone help me ... i am having trouble with scp
2007-10-02T09:18:00.000Z	sanrag		whenever i scp a file to my ubuntu system...it's lost... i mean i can't locate it in my home directory
2007-10-02T09:18:00.000Z	sanrag		what do i do
2007-10-02T09:18:00.000Z	iarwain1	sanrag	where did you copy it to?
2007-10-02T09:19:00.000Z	iarwain1	sanrag	try this "scp <file> sanrag@myip:/home/sanrag/
2007-10-02T09:21:00.000Z	iarwain1	sanrag	did you try the command i gave you?
2007-10-02T09:21:00.000Z	sanrag	iarwain1	yes....still not working
2007-10-02T09:22:00.000Z	iarwain1	sanrag	are you using the same user to copy from? (it could be that you have no write perms)
2007-10-02T09:23:00.000Z	iarwain1	sanrag	the fact that you're alone means nothing ;-)
2007-10-02T09:23:00.000Z	iarwain1	sanrag	how do you check if the file's there?
2007-10-02T09:23:00.000Z	iarwain1	sanrag	in the ssh'ed system?
2007-10-02T09:25:00.000Z	iarwain1	sanrag	btw, if you want to use locate, update your db first (sudo slocate -u)
2007-10-02T09:25:00.000Z	iarwain1	sanrag	couldn't update the db, or find it?
2007-10-02T09:26:00.000Z	iarwain1	sanrag	and the scp doesn't give any errors?
2007-10-02T09:28:00.000Z	iarwain1	sanrag	so you scp the file to ... ? (the path after the @myip:)
2007-10-02T09:29:00.000Z	iarwain1	sanrag	don't know why it won't copy O.o
2007-10-02T09:30:00.000Z	iarwain1	sanrag	check soundray's message to me :)
2007-10-02T09:33:00.000Z	iarwain1	sanrag	just a quick question, is the file you're trying to send, in the folder you're in? (try with an absolute path to the file)
