2008-10-31T07:01:00.000Z	Sjaki`		Hi guys - I make install a large amount of compiled files, which put about 100 files all over my file system, now I want to remove them
2008-10-31T07:01:00.000Z	Sjaki`		Is there an easy way
2008-10-31T07:02:00.000Z	Sjaki`		ok, thanks i'll try that nosklo
2008-10-31T07:03:00.000Z	Sjaki`		it's muchly appreciated
2008-10-31T07:04:00.000Z	Flannel	Sjaki`	In the future, use checkinstall, or find a deb
2008-10-31T08:52:00.000Z	Flannel	Sjaki`	Is there any reason you need it to go in /usr/src/?  and it can't jsut be dealt with from your homedir?
2008-10-31T08:53:00.000Z	Flannel	Sjaki`	Wait, wait, If you're new, what are you compiling? Or a better question, what are you trying to configure/install/set up/etc?
2008-10-31T08:55:00.000Z	Flannel	Sjaki`	did you file a bug to get it updated?  Also, does debian have a newer version?
2008-10-31T08:56:00.000Z	Flannel	Sjaki`	What version is the newest version?
2008-10-31T08:57:00.000Z	Flannel	Sjaki`	Ah, even debian unstable has 1.8.1
2008-10-31T08:59:00.000Z	Flannel	Sjaki`	right, but you can do all that compiling from your homedir, also see:
2008-10-31T09:03:00.000Z	Flannel	Sjaki`	I have no idea :)
2008-10-31T09:13:00.000Z	Flannel	Sjaki`	~/ is the same as /home/username/
2008-10-31T09:53:00.000Z	Flannel	Sjaki`	Did you use sudo to put stuff into that folder?
2008-10-31T09:55:00.000Z	Flannel	Sjaki`	right.  When you're dealing with stuff in your homedir, you don't use sudo.  BAsically, you used root to put stuff into your homedir, so now its owned by root.  Do this: sudo chown -R sam:sam /home/sam/pvpgn
2008-10-31T09:56:00.000Z	Flannel	Sjaki`	that'll change the ownership to those files (and all ones inside of it) back to you.
2008-10-31T10:19:00.000Z	Sjaki`	Flannel	You wouldn't have time to help me with another problem would you, perhaps?
2008-10-31T10:19:00.000Z	Flannel	Sjaki`	Best to ask the channel, anyone who knows the answer will answer, etc.
