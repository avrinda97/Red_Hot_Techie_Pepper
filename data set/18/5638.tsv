2009-04-04T16:00:00.000Z	lyhana8	DasEi	I just need a terminal
2009-04-04T16:03:00.000Z	DasEi	lyhana8	gentoo has  a terminal, too, I don't get your intention ..
2009-04-04T16:06:00.000Z	lyhana8	DasEi	yep they have one, but i want to update my kubuntu while i'm running into gentoo
2009-04-04T16:06:00.000Z	DasEi	lyhana8	you have dualboot ?
2009-04-04T16:08:00.000Z	DasEi	lyhana8	/etc/network/... ?!
2009-04-04T16:11:00.000Z	DasEi	lyhana8	(for ubuntu) /etc/resolv.conf or /etc/ppp/resolv.conf , do you dualboot ?
2009-04-04T16:11:00.000Z	lyhana8	DasEi	yep i've a dual boot
2009-04-04T16:12:00.000Z	DasEi	lyhana8	so from your gentto you could chroot into ubuntu to do updates
2009-04-04T16:13:00.000Z	lyhana8	DasEi	does a `chroot /mnt/kubuntu` is enough to use the kubuntu bash environnemt ?
2009-04-04T16:14:00.000Z	DasEi	lyhana8	yes, you change the root-dir to that then, and all cmd's will be executed there, like gnome-terminal
2009-04-04T16:15:00.000Z	lyhana8	DasEi	ok
2009-04-04T16:17:00.000Z	lyhana8	DasEi	I haven't access to the net... that's why i need to update the /etc/resolv.conf
2009-04-04T16:19:00.000Z	lyhana8	DasEi	with a cable
2009-04-04T16:22:00.000Z	lyhana8	DasEi	I'm behind a routeur with an IP associated to my mac adress
2009-04-04T16:23:00.000Z	DasEi	lyhana8	if interfaces is in order,  rename resolv.conf to something else (backup) and start without it
2009-04-04T16:27:00.000Z	DasEi	lyhana8	Je suis fatigu√©, so leaving now..
