2008-04-06T11:41:00.000Z	XTeLiS		use xubuntu
2008-04-06T11:41:00.000Z	XTeLiS		on older systems
2008-04-06T11:42:00.000Z	XTeLiS		hrmm... at least its not a delll
2008-04-06T11:42:00.000Z	XTeLiS		dell even
2008-04-06T11:42:00.000Z	XTeLiS		hard to set them up correctly
2008-04-06T11:42:00.000Z	XTeLiS		well at least mine was a pain in the neck
2008-04-06T11:42:00.000Z	macogw	XTeLiS	only if it has a Dell Broadcom wireless card
2008-04-06T11:45:00.000Z	macogw	XTeLiS	the drivers should be there automatically on 7.10, but you need firmware
2008-04-06T11:45:00.000Z	macogw	XTeLiS	are you on that computer right now?
2008-04-06T11:45:00.000Z	macogw	XTeLiS	ok download http://macoafi.googlepages.com/firmware.tar.gz
2008-04-06T11:45:00.000Z	macogw	XTeLiS	firmware is the part that the card itself loads and then the OS uses the driver to talk to the firmware to tell the card what to do
2008-04-06T11:46:00.000Z	macogw	XTeLiS	at least, that's my understanding of it. anyone is free to correct.
2008-04-06T11:46:00.000Z	macogw	XTeLiS	i tar'd up the firmware from my mom's computer. she has a broadcom card too.
2008-04-06T11:48:00.000Z	macogw	XTeLiS	after it's downloaded to your desktop, double click it to extract it.  open a terminal (apps -> accessories -> terminal) and type "cd Desktop" (with the capitals)
2008-04-06T11:48:00.000Z	macogw	XTeLiS	then type "sudo mv firmware/* /lib/firmware/" and hit enter
2008-04-06T11:48:00.000Z	macogw	XTeLiS	and then it *should* work
