2005-02-15T17:53:00.000Z	sabine		It's really a shame that a PIII with 1000MHz and 256MB RAM doesn't do for normal office work under Linux, speed-wise.
2005-02-15T17:54:00.000Z	elJo-	sabine	it doesn't?
2005-02-15T06:02:00.000Z	sabine	elJo-	Not for somebody who is used to Windows XP and MS Office. I didn't want to believe, but then I tried -- XP is up in about 20 seconds, Word takes less than 5. Ubuntu needs circa 1:30, then OpenOffice another minute.
2005-02-15T06:02:00.000Z	elJo-	sabine	now i could tell you all that stuff about windows preloading office, but i won't ;)
2005-02-15T06:03:00.000Z	elJo-	sabine	i admit that gnome on anything but recent hardware (< 3 years) feels slow
2005-02-15T06:03:00.000Z	sabine	elJo-	Well, that's all fine. But even WITH preloading office, Windows takes 20 seconds to boot on this machine, as opposed to Ubuntu - which does not preload OpenOffice and needs one and a half minute
2005-02-15T06:04:00.000Z	sabine	elJo-	GNOME itself actually is as fast as I could wish. The problem is booting time and office suite startup time. Everything else is fine.
2005-02-15T06:04:00.000Z	elJo-	sabine	there's a gnome-applet for preloading ooo - maybe that'll help a bit
2005-02-15T06:05:00.000Z	sabine	elJo-	I just tried that. It isn't a preloader, just a starter.
2005-02-15T06:06:00.000Z	elJo-	sabine	sorry to hear that
2005-02-15T06:06:00.000Z	elJo-	sabine	you're not german, by chance? :)
2005-02-15T06:07:00.000Z	sabine	elJo-	Well, I actually am.
2005-02-15T06:07:00.000Z	elJo-	sabine	thought so :)
2005-02-15T06:07:00.000Z	sabine	elJo-	How did you know?
2005-02-15T06:07:00.000Z	elJo-	sabine	yup :)
2005-02-15T06:08:00.000Z	elJo-	sabine	now the question is who's rapha.. but that's certainly ot ;)
2005-02-15T06:09:00.000Z	sabine	elJo-	rapha is more or less a regular visitor in here
2005-02-15T06:09:00.000Z	elJo-	sabine	assume i know nothing about this channel. which is true :)
