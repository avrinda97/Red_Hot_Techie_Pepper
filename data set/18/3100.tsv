2010-01-11T00:04:00.000Z	bdesk		Hi, how do I make "apt-get install" fast?  Googling shows something called netselect-apt, but this was apparently obsoleted.
2010-01-11T00:05:00.000Z	bdesk		I want "apt-get install" to download stuff at lots of megabytes per second instead of only a few kilobytes per second.
2010-01-11T00:05:00.000Z	jrib	bdesk	use a better mirror
2010-01-11T00:09:00.000Z	jrib	bdesk	System -> Administration -> Software Sources
2010-01-11T00:09:00.000Z	bdesk	jrib	i'm don't have gui; i'm using server edition.
2010-01-11T00:10:00.000Z	jrib	bdesk	search apt, I believe there is some similar program
2010-01-11T00:10:00.000Z	bdesk	jrib	what do you mean search apt? you mean read the apt manual?
2010-01-11T00:10:00.000Z	jrib	bdesk	no, apt-cache search or whatever you prefer
2010-01-11T00:11:00.000Z	jrib	bdesk	I use netselect-apt on debian, I don't know if it "just works" on ubuntu
2010-01-11T00:11:00.000Z	bdesk	jrib	apt-cache search netselect gives only one result and it's not applicable.
2010-01-11T00:11:00.000Z	bdesk	jrib	no, netselect-apt is broken in ubuntu and was removed.
2010-01-11T00:12:00.000Z	jrib	bdesk	how about apt-spy?
2010-01-11T00:13:00.000Z	bdesk	jrib	there was no search result, and i think that's debian-only too.  I guess I'll just manually enter ibiblio or something.  Thanks!
2010-01-11T00:13:00.000Z	jrib	bdesk	well you can use netselect and just list the repositories yourself
2010-01-11T00:14:00.000Z	bdesk	jrib	no, netselect is not in ubuntu anymore.
2010-01-11T00:14:00.000Z	jrib	bdesk	I see.  I assumed that was the one result without checking
2010-01-11T00:16:00.000Z	jrib	bdesk	kind of dumb that netselect got removed
2010-01-11T00:16:00.000Z	jrib	bdesk	as pointed out in https://bugs.edge.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/netselect/+bug/337377 :)
