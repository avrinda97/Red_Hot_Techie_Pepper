2006-12-19T07:49:00.000Z	h0ndaracer2		so but if i left it doing all night then i could get reported
2006-12-19T07:49:00.000Z	un_operateur1	h0ndaracer2	not really -- most people set their computers/routers to drop pings
2006-12-19T07:53:00.000Z	un_operateur1	h0ndaracer2	check tor out :)
2006-12-19T07:54:00.000Z	un_operateur1	h0ndaracer2	are you using firefox or something similar?
2006-12-19T07:54:00.000Z	un_operateur1	h0ndaracer2	verify the proxy settings in firefox then --
2006-12-19T07:55:00.000Z	un_operateur1	h0ndaracer2	is tor the application you use to "hide" your IP address??
2006-12-19T07:55:00.000Z	un_operateur1	h0ndaracer2	you said you had tor?  anyway, what do you use instead?
2006-12-19T07:57:00.000Z	un_operateur1	h0ndaracer2	I have a feeling that utility just proxies web/WWW traffic for your browsers and not everything
2006-12-19T07:57:00.000Z	un_operateur1	h0ndaracer2	most public proxies only support basic proxying for www and mail .. nothing more
