2005-07-22T14:29:00.000Z	knowledge_		Guys, I need help....I keep having to do sudo modprobe i8k and it won't save it
2005-07-22T14:29:00.000Z	knowledge_		and my wifi isn't working
2005-07-22T14:30:00.000Z	knowledge_		all because I patched my kernel
2005-07-22T14:30:00.000Z	knowledge_		with another driver
2005-07-22T14:30:00.000Z	Raskall	knowledge_	add "i8k" to the file /etc/modules
2005-07-22T14:31:00.000Z	Raskall	knowledge_	I thought you did the modprobe thing for your wifi card. has your wifi card ever worked?
2005-07-22T14:31:00.000Z	Raskall	knowledge_	ok.. you need the madwifi drivers.
2005-07-22T14:32:00.000Z	knowledge_	Raskall	yes, it did work before I patched that kernel
2005-07-22T14:32:00.000Z	Raskall	knowledge_	you have to get madwifi into your homebrew kernel somehow
2005-07-22T14:32:00.000Z	Raskall	knowledge_	but I cannot tell you how. I just read somewhere that atheros use madwifi.
2005-07-22T14:34:00.000Z	Raskall	knowledge_	what made you compile your own kernel?
2005-07-22T14:35:00.000Z	Raskall	knowledge_	agh.. that much work for a sucky way to control your mouse. :) When I had the same problem I bought a tiny optical travel mouse.
2005-07-22T14:35:00.000Z	Raskall	knowledge_	and disabled the touchpad in bios
2005-07-22T14:36:00.000Z	knowledge_	Raskall	the funnier thing is every thing was working fine I just wanted the extra features.....
2005-07-22T14:38:00.000Z	knowledge_	Raskall	if I do the wifi thing....will I lose my alps driver?
2005-07-22T14:40:00.000Z	Raskall	knowledge_	you just add. But I am not sure if madwifi is included in the kernel source. check madwifi.sourceforge.net or something. maybe you can just download and "make install" the drivers on your running kernel
2005-07-22T14:40:00.000Z	knowledge_	Raskall	thanks
2005-07-22T14:42:00.000Z	Raskall	knowledge_	you can try asking at #madwifi irc channel here on freenode too.
