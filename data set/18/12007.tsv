2007-03-28T07:24:00.000Z	ed1t		how do i create a shortcut to a folder /media/sda1 and /media/sda5 on desktop?
2007-03-28T07:25:00.000Z	Pelo	ed1t	 go to /media/  rightclick,  make the short cut and move it to where youwant
2007-03-28T07:27:00.000Z	ed1t	Pelo	'make link' in the menu is greyed out
2007-03-28T07:28:00.000Z	Pelo	ed1t	 you might need to be root for that folder , you can also try   terminal     sudo ln-s  /media/sda1  /home/user/Desktop/sda1
2007-03-28T07:28:00.000Z	Pelo	ed1t	 but drives mounted in /media/ are suppose to appear on your desktop automaticaly
2007-03-28T07:28:00.000Z	ed1t	Pelo	it didnt...maybe coz im on 7.04?
2007-03-28T07:29:00.000Z	ed1t	Pelo	im using the ntfs configuration tool
2007-03-28T07:30:00.000Z	Pelo	ed1t	 that sudo  ln -s command should do it
2007-03-28T07:30:00.000Z	ed1t	Pelo	 yea it worked, thx
2007-05-24T14:08:00.000Z	Pelo	ed1t	 the jdk pacakges are in the repos you donT need the tar.gz files
2007-05-24T14:09:00.000Z	ed1t	Pelo	well then where is the jdk installed? coz i need to set JAVA_HOME

2007-08-20T06:14:00.000Z	Pelo	ed1t	  devede, it is in the repos but I suggest you get the latest from the site, there is a new menu feature in it which is quite nice
2007-08-20T06:14:00.000Z	ed1t	Pelo	thx
2008-02-24T06:18:00.000Z	Pelo	ed1t	do it from synaptic,  there might be several other packages that need removal
