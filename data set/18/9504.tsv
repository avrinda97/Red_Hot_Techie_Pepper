2007-03-26T14:24:00.000Z	cringous		Hello all. I've bought an ASUS M2N-E motherboard and 2 SATA Samsung 250GB, configured as RAID mirror in setup. Can I install Ubuntu with this configuration ?
2007-03-26T14:25:00.000Z	adaptr	cringous	I have that board, it should fly.. dual core on it ?
2007-03-26T14:26:00.000Z	cringous	adaptr	I have an Atlhon 64 3500 on it. But just Windows running :-(
2007-03-26T14:26:00.000Z	adaptr	cringous	that's too bad - I gots me an X2 2GHz low-power, and it runs cooler than my single-core 2GHz :)
2007-03-26T14:28:00.000Z	cringous	adaptr	But my problem is about installing Ubuntu on it. It is possible ? With RAID configured ?
2007-03-26T14:28:00.000Z	adaptr	cringous	what kind of raid ?
2007-03-26T14:29:00.000Z	cringous	adaptr	Mirror, configured at setup, Nvidia chipset.
2007-03-26T14:29:00.000Z	adaptr	cringous	then you need to put in the livecd and see if it is detected; if not, then you can't
2007-03-26T14:32:00.000Z	cringous	adaptr	That's bad, really not happen. With only one SATA disk the livecd don't recognize too, but it can be done.
2007-03-26T14:32:00.000Z	adaptr	cringous	well, what kind of controller are the disks on ?
2007-03-26T14:33:00.000Z	cringous	adaptr	Let me see exactly...
2007-03-26T14:34:00.000Z	cringous	adaptr	It's a shame can't running Linux on my machine, just Windows... Wait a minute, I'm looking for the specifications
2007-03-26T14:36:00.000Z	cringous	adaptr	As far I know, the controller is the NVIDIA nForce 570
2007-03-26T14:37:00.000Z	adaptr	cringous	yes, that's what I have, too - surprise!
2007-03-26T14:37:00.000Z	adaptr	cringous	don't. use. on-board. crap.
2007-03-26T14:40:00.000Z	adaptr	cringous	erm.. no
2007-03-26T14:40:00.000Z	adaptr	cringous	if you want to run ubuntu on a mirror then you have to install it on one
2007-03-26T14:42:00.000Z	cringous	adaptr	xtknight, thank you very much
