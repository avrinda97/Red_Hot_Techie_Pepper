2009-04-24T05:05:00.000Z	remote	yoasif	i signed up for this, but i don't think its what i want, i want to turn my dynamic ip into a word. like billy.opendns.com
2009-04-24T05:06:00.000Z	remote	yoasif	can i do this with opendns?:
2009-04-24T05:06:00.000Z	yoasif	remote	for yourself or others?
2009-04-24T05:06:00.000Z	yoasif	remote	i mean on your own computer or for anyone
2009-04-24T05:06:00.000Z	remote	yoasif	for anyone really
2009-04-24T05:07:00.000Z	yoasif	remote	yeah dyndns works
2009-04-24T05:07:00.000Z	remote	yoasif	i just want a name to remember so that when i type billy.opendns.com i can access my freenx server from anywhere in the world
2009-04-24T05:07:00.000Z	remote	yoasif	so whats the point of opendns?
2009-04-24T05:07:00.000Z	yoasif	remote	faster/always up dns servers if your own dns servers flake out. also, you can make "bookmarks" and block certain types of sites
2009-04-24T05:08:00.000Z	remote	yoasif	ya i think i'll stick with my isp's dns servers, they work just fine :P
2009-04-24T05:08:00.000Z	remote	yoasif	so now dyndns, is there a linux client i have to run?
2009-04-24T05:08:00.000Z	remote	yoasif	or how does it update my dynamic ip?
