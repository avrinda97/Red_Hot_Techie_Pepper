2007-08-29T15:41:00.000Z	shard		I'm having problems with a ubuntu server (7.04) install on an old machine. The install runs fine. When it boots up the machine brings up the login prompt but won't accept any input from the keyboard

2007-08-29T15:42:00.000Z	VoX	shard	what sort of keyboar? at/ps2/usb?
2007-08-29T15:42:00.000Z	shard	VoX	ps2. it works perfectly through the whole install.
2007-08-29T15:44:00.000Z	shard	VoX	didn't try that. I thought since the login prompt came up it should accept the login
2007-08-29T15:44:00.000Z	shard	VoX	am starting up machine to try it now
2007-08-29T15:44:00.000Z	VoX	shard	righto
2007-08-29T15:44:00.000Z	shard	VoX	no luck
2007-08-29T15:45:00.000Z	VoX	shard	ok, does the numlock light turn on and off when you press it?
2007-08-29T15:46:00.000Z	shard	VoX	nope.
2007-08-29T15:46:00.000Z	VoX	shard	hmm. what motherboard is it?
2007-08-29T15:48:00.000Z	shard	VoX	an old gigabyte one. takes a socket 370 processor
2007-08-29T15:48:00.000Z	VoX	shard	i'd suggest something doesnt like the ps2 controller or the keyboard. do you have a different keyboard to test?
2007-08-29T15:49:00.000Z	shard	VoX	nope. it seems a bit strange though - the ubuntu installer didn't have any issues at all with the keyboard
2007-08-29T15:49:00.000Z	VoX	shard	do you have a ps2->usb convertor?
2007-08-29T15:50:00.000Z	shard	VoX	I'll go and have a rummage around. Will Ubuntu boot fine with a USB keyboard?
2007-08-29T15:51:00.000Z	VoX	shard	yeah, tho you may have to tell your bios not to hault on no-keyboard-found-errors
2007-08-29T15:54:00.000Z	shard	VoX	many thanks - now working
