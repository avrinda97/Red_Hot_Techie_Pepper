2008-02-27T18:41:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix		Gnome Main Menu Editor (aka alacarte) won't change some menu names. I can't edit GIMP Image Manipulation Program, for example. I change the name, and nothing happens. Reboot doesn't fix it.
2008-02-27T18:41:00.000Z	Amaranth	ArthurArchnix	I take it you aren't using Ubuntu 7.10
2008-02-27T18:41:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	Amaranth	I am
2008-02-27T18:42:00.000Z	Amaranth	ArthurArchnix	Then I have no idea
2008-02-27T18:42:00.000Z	Amaranth	ArthurArchnix	It's probably Ubuntu's gettext support messing crap up again
2008-02-27T18:42:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	Amaranth	No clue where the actual config files are that alacarte is editing?
2008-02-27T18:42:00.000Z	Amaranth	ArthurArchnix	Oh, I know that, I wrote it :P
2008-02-27T18:42:00.000Z	Amaranth	ArthurArchnix	that'd be ~/.local/share/applications/
2008-02-27T18:42:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	Amaranth	^
2008-02-27T18:43:00.000Z	Amaranth	ArthurArchnix	The problem is that alacarte is calling gnome-desktop-item-edit which edits Name[en] but thanks to Ubuntu changes this key is ignored and it needs to change Name
2008-02-27T18:43:00.000Z	Amaranth	ArthurArchnix	So this is an Ubuntu-only problem that needs to be fixed in gnome-desktop-item-edit which is a part of gnome-panel
2008-02-27T18:44:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	Amaranth	hehe... I'm quite happy with it otherwise and don't mind getting my fingers dirty a bit.
2008-02-27T18:45:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	Amaranth	So, for example, I would do this: "sudo mv Take/ Screenshot.desktop Screenshot.desktop"
2008-02-27T18:45:00.000Z	Amaranth	ArthurArchnix	the file name is unimportant
2008-02-27T18:46:00.000Z	Amaranth	ArthurArchnix	it's the contents of the file which luckily are ini-type (like windows .ini files) so very easy to edit by hand
2008-02-27T18:46:00.000Z	ArthurArchnix	Amaranth	Ahh.. I see it now. Super. Cheers.

2008-03-20T01:30:00.000Z	Amaranth	ArthurArchnix	I removed the ban :P
