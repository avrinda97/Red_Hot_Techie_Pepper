2011-01-19T15:47:00.000Z	skilz	RAMNUS	why do you want windows?
2011-01-19T15:47:00.000Z	skilz	RAMNUS	What can Windows do that Ubuntu cannot?
2011-01-19T15:47:00.000Z	RAMNUS	skilz	there are some programs, licenced programs, windows can run but ubuntu not.
2011-01-19T15:48:00.000Z	skilz	RAMNUS	I can run any Windows application / game in Ubuntu using wine..
2011-01-19T15:48:00.000Z	skilz	RAMNUS	Everyday :)
2011-01-19T15:49:00.000Z	skilz	RAMNUS	basically, it allows you to run windows programs on ubuntu but using windows dll's...
2011-01-19T15:50:00.000Z	skilz	RAMNUS	Give it a shot, it's a lot better then dual booting and restarting all the time, less resource consuming also.
