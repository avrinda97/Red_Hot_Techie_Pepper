2007-08-12T13:25:00.000Z	Wolfwalker		 Okay, I have just decided it is impossible to boot from a USB cdrom if the computer was made before 2001
2007-08-12T13:25:00.000Z	Wolfwalker		|ubuntu:|  try k3b or gnomebaker
2007-08-12T13:25:00.000Z	Wolfwalker		 !gnomebaker | ubuntu
2007-08-12T13:25:00.000Z	Falstius	Wolfwalker	it is difficult to boot from most USB devices for a computer that old.
2007-08-13T08:42:00.000Z	Falstius	Wolfwalker	when does it freeze when you boot with the feisty kernel?
2007-08-13T08:42:00.000Z	Falstius	Wolfwalker	I mean does it display the Ubuntu logo and just sit there, or does it give an error message or just a blank screen?
2007-08-13T08:44:00.000Z	Falstius	Wolfwalker	can't access tty: job control turned off ?
2007-08-13T08:46:00.000Z	Falstius	Wolfwalker	please write down whatever it says when it fails to load (at least the last few lines)
2007-08-13T08:49:00.000Z	Falstius	Wolfwalker	select that kernel, hit e to edit it.  delete quiet and splash, hit enter to accept the change, enter again to boot
2007-08-13T08:58:00.000Z	Falstius	Wolfwalker	okay, that maybe can be fixed.  You should edit fstab to replace UUID=... to point to your drives as /dev/sd?? instead of UUID, or fix the UUID.  I've read that a lot of people have problems with some disk controllers when upgrading to feisty.  You might also just stick with edgy unless you have a special need to upgrade.
2007-08-13T09:00:00.000Z	Falstius	Wolfwalker	UUID is a way of identifying devices and filesystems uniquely.  So if you move your hardware around it will still know which is which.
2007-08-13T09:01:00.000Z	Falstius	Wolfwalker	you can try loading your drives by /dev/ instead of UUID or switch to a different kernel
2007-08-13T09:03:00.000Z	Falstius	Wolfwalker	yeah, you can just use the older kernel (go with Edgy's if that works)
2007-08-13T09:04:00.000Z	Falstius	Wolfwalker	you'd have to do that by editing /etc/fstab  ... and I'm not sure it will work.
2007-08-13T09:07:00.000Z	Falstius	Wolfwalker	with edgy?
2007-08-13T09:10:00.000Z	Falstius	Wolfwalker	root=/dev/sda1 (or whatever is correct for your computer)
2007-08-13T09:21:00.000Z	Falstius	Wolfwalker	do you have ide or sata hard drives?
2007-08-13T09:23:00.000Z	Falstius	Wolfwalker	probably ide (which is good because it is less likely to change drive numbers with different operating systems).
