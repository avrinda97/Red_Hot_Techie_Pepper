2009-10-10T22:31:00.000Z	Neurolysis		Anyone in here know about DD causing disks to become smaller? I dd'd an image onto a USB stick a few days back and now Windows shows the disk as being the size of the image :\
2009-10-10T22:31:00.000Z	Neurolysis		is there something I have to do?
2009-10-10T22:32:00.000Z	ikonia	Neurolysis	if you're dd'ing a disk it will take the partition table of the disk the iamge was made from, which can make it "seem" smaller
2009-10-10T22:32:00.000Z	Neurolysis	ikonia	how should i get it to recognise the full disk size again?
2009-10-10T22:32:00.000Z	ikonia	Neurolysis	you'd have to reparition it and re-write the partition table,
2009-10-10T22:32:00.000Z	Neurolysis	ikonia	...how would i do that? :|
2009-10-10T22:33:00.000Z	ikonia	Neurolysis	that's can be quite tricky,
2009-10-10T22:35:00.000Z	Neurolysis	ikonia	just been doing some reading, but i don't understand totally -- can 'gpart' guess the right partition table or something?
2009-10-10T22:35:00.000Z	ikonia	Neurolysis	it won't guess it, you need to re-write it
2009-10-10T22:36:00.000Z	Neurolysis	ikonia	well, if i only want one partition that should be simple enough, right?
2009-10-10T22:36:00.000Z	ikonia	Neurolysis	try it - but take a backup
2009-10-10T22:36:00.000Z	ikonia	Neurolysis	that's the price of using images, it takes the configuration of the image the machine was made on
2009-10-10T22:38:00.000Z	Neurolysis	ikonia	i don't have anything on the disk i need to backup
2009-10-10T22:45:00.000Z	Neurolysis	ikonia	it appears after all that gpart can actually guess at partitions :|
2009-10-10T22:45:00.000Z	ikonia	Neurolysis	great news
2009-10-10T22:47:00.000Z	Neurolysis	ikonia	how would i go about manually creating a partition table for it to write? it does have a -b switch to restore a backup, but i don't have one
2009-10-10T22:47:00.000Z	ikonia	Neurolysis	honestly, I've never thought about that, you could dd it off
2009-10-10T22:47:00.000Z	Neurolysis	ikonia	yeah but the issue is at this point in time i'm stuck with the 7mb table
