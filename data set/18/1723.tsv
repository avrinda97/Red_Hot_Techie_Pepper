2011-02-07T01:34:00.000Z	psykatog		E: Malformed line 55 in source list /etc/apt/sources.list (dist)
2011-02-07T01:34:00.000Z	psykatog		   how do I fix that?
2011-02-07T01:35:00.000Z	ikonia	psykatog	look at line 55
2011-02-07T01:35:00.000Z	psykatog	ikonia	how?
2011-02-07T01:36:00.000Z	psykatog	ikonia	where's the file I need to look at in a text editor?
2011-02-07T01:41:00.000Z	psykatog	ikonia	okay, I found the source list - it appears line 55 (and 54) are from attempts to install libreoffice, it reads : deb http://download.tuxfamily.com/gericom/libreoffice/
2011-02-07T01:41:00.000Z	psykatog	ikonia	can I just delete lines 54 and 55?
2011-02-07T01:41:00.000Z	ikonia	psykatog	what are they
2011-02-07T01:42:00.000Z	psykatog	ikonia	they're both "deb http://download.tuxfamily.com/gericom/libreoffice/" , from unsuccessful attempts to install libreoffice
2011-02-07T01:43:00.000Z	ikonia	psykatog	I'd remove them both
2011-02-07T01:45:00.000Z	psykatog	ikonia	okay, that let me run autoremove, but I'm still having a problem with my trash being 'full' whenever I want to delete anything.  I'm using KDEbuntu though, do you think it's a dolphin problem?
2011-02-07T01:45:00.000Z	ikonia	psykatog	don't run a tool, just remove those linues
2011-02-07T01:45:00.000Z	psykatog	ikonia	I did remove those lines.  I got the original error message from trying to run the autoremove command
2011-02-07T01:46:00.000Z	ikonia	psykatog	remove the lines, then do "sudo apt-get update"
2011-02-07T01:46:00.000Z	ikonia	psykatog	see if it errros
2011-02-07T01:46:00.000Z	psykatog	ikonia	no, it works.
2011-02-07T01:46:00.000Z	ikonia	psykatog	you should be fine then
2011-02-07T01:46:00.000Z	psykatog	ikonia	alright, thanks
