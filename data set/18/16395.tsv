2005-03-30T07:15:00.000Z	membreya		az[a] zel: ...the modem IS supported in ubuntu
2005-03-30T07:15:00.000Z	az[a] zel	membreya	oh
2005-03-30T07:18:00.000Z	az[a] zel	membreya	no I dont think those ones work for soft modem.. at least that's what I've read
2005-03-30T07:18:00.000Z	az[a] zel	membreya	but I read that smart link drivers work
2005-03-30T07:19:00.000Z	az[a] zel	membreya	http://www.smlink.com/objects/slmodem-2.9.10.tar.gz
2005-03-30T07:19:00.000Z	az[a] zel	membreya	but ubuntu doesnt come with gcc and kernel sources does it? so it's going to be bloody hard to get a compiled driver happening, unless somebody else compiles and builds a package for her
2005-03-30T07:22:00.000Z	az[a] zel	membreya	same, and im running hoary.. the person that does it has to be running the exact same kernel revision as her
2005-03-30T07:28:00.000Z	az[a] zel	membreya	not internodes fault
2005-03-30T07:28:00.000Z	az[a] zel	membreya	yeah, but doesn't mean they aren't a quality ISP.. they have an ubuntu mirror on the non-metered list :)
