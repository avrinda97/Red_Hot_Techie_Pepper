2010-10-23T14:37:00.000Z	blackbox		hidek, i'm copying 1Tb to 1Tb over dd, it's REALLY slow, how do i make it faster?
2010-10-23T14:37:00.000Z	ectospasm	blackbox	are the two files on the same filesystem?
2010-10-23T14:38:00.000Z	ectospasm	blackbox	1TB takes a LOOOOOOONG time to copy
2010-10-23T14:38:00.000Z	ectospasm	blackbox	considering even the fastest SATA drives work at 6GB/s
2010-10-23T14:40:00.000Z	ectospasm	blackbox	why are you using dd and not something higher level like rsync?
2010-10-23T14:42:00.000Z	ectospasm	blackbox	you get no checks on corruption there, though
2010-10-23T14:42:00.000Z	ectospasm	blackbox	what good is the transfer if it's corrupted?
2010-10-23T14:47:00.000Z	blackbox	ectospasm	I don't think it;s a good idea, i'm doing 2 drives... they're in LVM and there's a folder that breaches across both drives (1.5tb) so i don't htink rsync can help me there
2010-10-23T14:48:00.000Z	ectospasm	blackbox	wait, so both drives are physical volumes of the same volume group?
2010-10-23T14:49:00.000Z	blackbox	ectospasm	that's what LVM is good for isn't it?
2010-10-23T14:50:00.000Z	ectospasm	blackbox	yeah, that's fine, until you need to migrate data off one pv
2010-10-23T14:50:00.000Z	ectospasm	blackbox	what are you trying to do, again?
2010-10-23T14:51:00.000Z	ectospasm	blackbox	that's not specific enough
2010-10-23T14:51:00.000Z	ectospasm	blackbox	give me something higher level than that
2010-10-23T14:51:00.000Z	blackbox	ectospasm	exactly copy what's on one set to 1Tb drives to another
2010-10-23T14:51:00.000Z	blackbox	ectospasm	i'm going to make a mdadm array
2010-10-23T14:52:00.000Z	blackbox	ectospasm	and I need to back up the drives before I put them in
2010-10-23T14:52:00.000Z	ectospasm	blackbox	outside my realm of expertise
