2005-01-23T14:50:00.000Z	mcphail		g++ is installed? what does "which g++" say?
2005-01-23T14:51:00.000Z	mcphail		is g++ really installed? (need to add on to gcc)
2005-01-23T14:52:00.000Z	mcphail		but g++ itself?
2005-01-23T14:53:00.000Z	mcphail		is it the same version as the installed gcc?
2005-01-23T14:54:00.000Z	mcphail		might be sufficient to make g++ a simlink to gcc
2005-01-23T14:55:00.000Z	FuNgEx	mcphail	thx
2005-01-23T15:17:00.000Z	FuNgEx	mcphail	g++ still not working
2005-01-23T15:19:00.000Z	mcphail	FuNgEx	is gcc itself working?
2005-01-23T15:19:00.000Z	FuNgEx	mcphail	yes
2005-01-23T15:21:00.000Z	mcphail	FuNgEx	try sudo ln -s /usr/bin/gcc /usr/bin/g++
2005-01-23T15:23:00.000Z	FuNgEx	mcphail	that worked
2005-01-23T15:24:00.000Z	mcphail	FuNgEx	excellent
2005-01-23T15:24:00.000Z	FuNgEx	mcphail	thx
2005-01-23T15:26:00.000Z	FuNgEx	mcphail	Live and Learn
2005-01-23T15:28:00.000Z	mcphail	FuNgEx	worth trying Linux From Scratch when you have a spare weekend
2005-01-23T15:31:00.000Z	mcphail	FuNgEx	nautilus looks different from GNOME 2.6 onwards
2005-01-23T15:33:00.000Z	FuNgEx	mcphail	they could catch up with .Net 1.1 and now there's even .Net 2.0
2005-01-23T15:35:00.000Z	FuNgEx	mcphail	yes... that's a pain in the but... but generics and everything
