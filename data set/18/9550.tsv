2007-03-22T07:58:00.000Z	evoxy		what's the difference between aiglx and xgl?
2007-03-22T07:59:00.000Z	xfab	evoxy	aiglx is built in in Edgy and XGL is a seperated package of software
2007-03-22T08:00:00.000Z	xfab	evoxy	If AIGLX is supported by your graficcard, use it
2007-03-22T08:00:00.000Z	xfab	evoxy	XGL hasn't got that much performance
2007-03-22T08:00:00.000Z	evoxy	xfab	is there a list for supported ones?
2007-03-22T08:01:00.000Z	xfab	evoxy	which graficcard do you possess?
2007-03-22T08:03:00.000Z	xfab	evoxy	hmm.. I'll google a moment for it, I think there's a list

2007-03-22T08:11:00.000Z	evoxy	xfab	how would i enable aiglx?
2007-03-22T08:12:00.000Z	xfab	evoxy	it's enabled by default
2007-03-22T08:12:00.000Z	xfab	evoxy	but just in edgy I think
2007-03-22T08:12:00.000Z	evoxy	xfab	is edgy 6.06?
2007-03-22T08:13:00.000Z	xfab	evoxy	In previous versions AIGLX isn't implemented and doesn't work very well though
2007-03-22T08:13:00.000Z	xfab	evoxy	6.10
