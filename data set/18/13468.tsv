2006-05-27T10:13:00.000Z	sam_	varsendagger	The best way is fix your adsl router/modem/bridge thingy.
2006-05-27T10:13:00.000Z	varsendagger	sam_	such as
2006-05-27T10:14:00.000Z	sam_	varsendagger	with a prepend line:
2006-05-27T10:15:00.000Z	varsendagger	sam_	 do that in console or where
2006-05-27T10:15:00.000Z	sam_	varsendagger	but first try what nickrud is explaining
2006-05-27T10:17:00.000Z	varsendagger	sam_	how did you guess that i have a qwest dsl server
2006-05-27T10:19:00.000Z	sam_	varsendagger	just use the prepend line.
2006-05-27T10:20:00.000Z	sam_	varsendagger	you can use the qwest nameservers, that's not a problem. You just can't use the router as a name server
2006-05-27T10:21:00.000Z	varsendagger	sam_	 ^^
2006-05-27T10:21:00.000Z	sam_	varsendagger	do you need help to edit a text file?
2006-05-27T10:22:00.000Z	varsendagger	sam_	no i got that  i just don't want to mess up my net connection and i always seem to do that
2006-05-27T10:26:00.000Z	varsendagger	sam_	is it possible for me to make a web server with having a qwest dsl modem
2006-05-27T10:26:00.000Z	sam_	varsendagger	sure.
2006-05-27T10:26:00.000Z	varsendagger	sam_	do you know how to do that?
2006-05-27T10:28:00.000Z	varsendagger	sam_	i had a heck of a time getting a webserver setup   --- in fact i gave up
2006-05-27T10:28:00.000Z	sam_	varsendagger	just forward the ports you need (80 and stuff) to the box your server is on.
2006-05-27T10:30:00.000Z	varsendagger	sam_	nevermind   i will tackle that later when the fishing isn't a good
