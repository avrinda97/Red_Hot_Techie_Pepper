2010-01-28T04:12:00.000Z	Checkmate91		I am working on restoring data from a corrupt XP hard drive.  At this time, I have tried booting a live cd but fdisk cannot mount the drive.  I suspect that the motherboard does not recognize the harddrive because sudo fdisk -l reveals nothing at all.  Now...about this harddrive...there might be something physically wrong here.  The drive spins up BUT most of the time, the MOBO does not recognize it.  On the off chance that the MOBO does recognize
2010-01-28T04:12:00.000Z	Checkmate91		it, the drive tries to boot but after about 20 seconds restarts the computer.  Cany takers?
2010-01-28T04:13:00.000Z	k0d3g3ar	Checkmate91	 try putting the HDD in a freezer for 5 mins.  Then try again
2010-01-28T04:14:00.000Z	k0d3g3ar	Checkmate91	 ok ... dumb question... you have a backup,right?
2010-01-28T04:15:00.000Z	k0d3g3ar	Checkmate91	 then you have a problem, dude.  Have you tried Spinwrite on it?
2010-01-28T04:16:00.000Z	k0d3g3ar	Checkmate91	 its a really good HDD recovery tool from Steve Gibson.  www.grc.com I think
2010-01-28T04:17:00.000Z	k0d3g3ar	Checkmate91	 No, its a Live CD type boot disk.  Just as long as the HDD is connected somewhere in the chain it should find it
2010-01-28T04:18:00.000Z	k0d3g3ar	Checkmate91	 I've heard of problems like that being failures in the logic boards on the HDD controller.  Sometimes you can find the same drive, and swap out the logic board on it and it will work
2010-01-28T04:19:00.000Z	k0d3g3ar	Checkmate91	 No, I've never had it do that to me
2010-01-28T04:20:00.000Z	k0d3g3ar	Checkmate91	 I didn't tell you this, but there are hundreds of copies of Spinrite on bittorrent
2010-01-28T04:21:00.000Z	k0d3g3ar	Checkmate91	 Yes, its a total solution if its just about bad data on sectors.  This will go down to the bit level to try and recreate the data there so you can use the drive
2010-01-28T04:22:00.000Z	k0d3g3ar	Checkmate91	 If you  can't recognize it, it might be that the partition table is toast.  But Spinrite should be able to recover any recognizeable data for you
2010-01-28T04:30:00.000Z	k0d3g3ar	Checkmate91	 Sweet!  Fingers crossed
2010-01-28T04:30:00.000Z	k0d3g3ar	Checkmate91	 I'd still run Spinrite on it.  Even in maintenance mode it should be able to protect you from any bad sectors coming up later
2010-01-28T04:31:00.000Z	k0d3g3ar	Checkmate91	 np
2010-01-28T04:43:00.000Z	k0d3g3ar	Checkmate91	 Can you get to a login screen in Safe mode with Windows?
2010-01-28T04:44:00.000Z	k0d3g3ar	Checkmate91	 Or command prompt?  (ie. hold down F8 on boot)
2010-01-28T04:55:00.000Z	k0d3g3ar	Checkmate91	 No problem.
