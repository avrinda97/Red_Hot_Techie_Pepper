2008-02-25T00:51:00.000Z	rawbeef		:\ I tried to install kubuntu-desktop ontop of gnome last night, and it didn't work too great (the other applications list is huge with random things like cookies and etc) so i did a complete removal on synaptic of the kubuntu-desktop package but everything is still there
2008-02-25T00:52:00.000Z	rawbeef		anyone ever experience that?
2008-02-25T00:52:00.000Z	zcat[1]	rawbeef	sudo apt-get autoremove
2008-02-25T00:53:00.000Z	rawbeef	zcat[1]	E: Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (11 Resource temporarily unavailable)
2008-02-25T00:55:00.000Z	zcat[1]	rawbeef	kubuntu-desktop is a metapackage.. if you didn't specifically install all of the other packages it depends on, they will all get removed by apt-get autoremove if the package that depended on them has been removed.
2008-02-25T01:00:00.000Z	zcat[1]	rawbeef	I don't understand why 'sudo apt-get autoremove' won't work
2008-02-25T01:17:00.000Z	rawbeef	zcat[1]	 sorry for the late response, but the sudo won't work because I already uninstalled the actual "kubuntu-desktop" it's just all the things it installed thta are left
2008-02-25T01:18:00.000Z	zcat[1]	rawbeef	'sudo apt-get autoremove' should remove all the things that are left.
2008-02-25T01:19:00.000Z	rawbeef	zcat[1]	just enter sudo apt-get autoremove?
2008-02-25T01:20:00.000Z	zcat[1]	rawbeef	yes.. no package names.. just 'sudo apt-get autoremove'
2008-02-25T01:20:00.000Z	zcat[1]	rawbeef	it shouldn't
2008-02-25T01:28:00.000Z	rawbeef	zcat[1]	 sudo apt-get autoremove
2008-02-25T01:30:00.000Z	zcat[1]	rawbeef	oh dear :(
2008-02-25T01:30:00.000Z	rawbeef	zcat[1]	 :( is there nothing i can do?
2008-02-25T01:31:00.000Z	zcat[1]	rawbeef	nothing I can think of.
2008-02-25T01:32:00.000Z	zcat[1]	rawbeef	Ahhh.. then "apt-get remove <long list of packages>" might work
2008-02-25T01:32:00.000Z	rawbeef	zcat[1]	 one space inbetween each one?
2008-02-25T01:32:00.000Z	zcat[1]	rawbeef	yep.
