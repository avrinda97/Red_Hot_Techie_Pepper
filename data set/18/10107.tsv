2007-01-12T12:29:00.000Z	jmblack		Im having trouble with mysql-server after an apt-get update. Eventually I got to a point where all the mysql packages will remove (so I can re-add them) except mysql-server. I keep getting this error: http://jindal.pastebin.ca/314367
2007-01-12T12:29:00.000Z	jmblack		when upgrading mysql-server
2007-01-12T12:30:00.000Z	roryy	jmblack	do you know if the mysqld process is still running?
2007-01-12T12:32:00.000Z	jmblack	roryy	even after killing the processes (no mysqld when I "ps -A|grep mysql) it refuses to upgrade
2007-01-12T12:42:00.000Z	roryy	jmblack	I don't see anything about failing scripts though.. hm
2007-01-12T12:35:00.000Z	roryy	jmblack	sorry, I'm not sure what to suggest in that case. Perhaps a bug in the deb preinstall scripts?
2007-01-12T12:40:00.000Z	jmblack	roryy	yeah, I accept that its a but in the package, can I remove the package manaully somehow?
2007-01-12T12:40:00.000Z	roryy	jmblack	you can try 'dpkg' with a --force option
2007-01-12T12:41:00.000Z	roryy	jmblack	it's not something I've used often. Try 'dpkg --force-help' for more information
2007-01-12T12:42:00.000Z	roryy	jmblack	what happens if you just uninstall mysql-server? Same thing?
2007-01-12T12:44:00.000Z	jmblack	roryy	yes same messages
2007-01-12T12:48:00.000Z	roryy	jmblack	can you successfully run 'sudo /etc/init.d/mysqld start' and '/etc/init.d/mysqld stop'
2007-01-12T12:50:00.000Z	jmblack	roryy	'access denied for user 'debian-sys-maint'@'localhost'
2007-01-12T12:50:00.000Z	roryy	jmblack	hrm. maybe that's the problem?
2007-01-12T12:50:00.000Z	roryy	jmblack	you are using sudo, obviously ?
2007-01-12T12:53:00.000Z	roryy	jmblack	hrm. not getting much via google for that error message
2007-01-12T12:54:00.000Z	jmblack	roryy	same, I google way before I ask =)
2007-01-12T12:56:00.000Z	roryy	jmblack	have you changed /etc/hosts at all?
