2009-08-27T22:34:00.000Z	Berzerker	_nano	try going to another website? like yahoo.com?
2009-08-27T22:34:00.000Z	_nano	Berzerker	same issue no matter what website...it successfully connects but then the endless 'waiting for' in the status
2009-08-27T22:35:00.000Z	Berzerker	_nano	in FF?
2009-08-27T22:35:00.000Z	Berzerker	_nano	what version
2009-08-27T22:36:00.000Z	_nano	Berzerker	yeah and also in synaptic package manager
2009-08-27T22:36:00.000Z	_nano	Berzerker	3.0.13
2009-08-27T22:36:00.000Z	Berzerker	_nano	try FF3.5?
2009-08-27T22:36:00.000Z	Berzerker	_nano	sudo apt-get install firefox-3.5
2009-08-27T22:37:00.000Z	_nano	Berzerker	will try, but then I'm not sure why synaptic package manager would face issues ..but then again apt-get in command line works fine
2009-08-27T22:40:00.000Z	Berzerker	_nano	what kind of connection are you on? any routers involved?
2009-08-27T22:41:00.000Z	_nano	Berzerker	yeah routers are involved
2009-08-27T22:41:00.000Z	Berzerker	_nano	tried resets?
2009-08-27T22:41:00.000Z	_nano	Berzerker	no... i was wondering if ping works probably it's not a router issue
2009-08-27T22:41:00.000Z	_nano	Berzerker	wget works great as well
2009-08-27T22:42:00.000Z	Berzerker	_nano	ping is only 1 port. I'd try resets.
2009-08-27T22:43:00.000Z	_nano	Berzerker	I am just trying to figure out why is my router partial to wget and ping :P
2009-08-27T22:43:00.000Z	Berzerker	_nano	try resets first.
2009-08-27T22:43:00.000Z	_nano	Berzerker	right, just waiting for the firefox 3.5 to finish installing (mind you it's getting downloaded from apt-get command line and I've no idea how! )
