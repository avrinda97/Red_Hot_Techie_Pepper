2006-02-26T12:14:00.000Z	LjL	JoKo	cool, that will make it a bit easier i think...
2006-02-26T12:07:00.000Z	LjL	JoKo	have you no way of connecting that computer to a network (the internet if possible, your local network otherwise)? it'll be much easier i think
2006-02-26T12:07:00.000Z	JoKo	LjL	no... :(
2006-02-26T12:08:00.000Z	LjL	JoKo	well, installing ubuntu will be easy enough. updating it, or installing new programs, won't be as easy
2006-02-26T12:10:00.000Z	LjL	JoKo	yeah, you can create an updated CD from another computer
2006-02-26T12:10:00.000Z	JoKo	LjL	how to do so?
2006-02-26T12:10:00.000Z	LjL	JoKo	won't be the easiest thing on earth
2006-02-26T12:12:00.000Z	LjL	JoKo	well, it boils down to creating a partial mirror of Ubuntu's repositories on a CD. if it were not "partial", i think you could just copy the repository into a CD verbatim
2006-02-26T12:12:00.000Z	LjL	JoKo	but of course a CD won't hold the whole repository ;) so i think you should copy all the directories from the rep as they are, except for the "pool" directory -- there you should manually choose which packages you want
2006-02-26T12:12:00.000Z	LjL	JoKo	but... dependency hell
2006-02-26T12:13:00.000Z	LjL	JoKo	you don't at least have *another* computer with ubuntu?
2006-02-26T12:14:00.000Z	JoKo	LjL	I have a notebook with Ubuntu and net access...
2006-02-26T12:15:00.000Z	LjL	JoKo	try "apt-cache show apt-proxy". if you use that program to download updates for your laptop, then you'll probably be able to simply burn the apt-proxy directory on a cd
2006-02-26T12:17:00.000Z	LjL	JoKo	"apt-move" might be useful too, it builds a mirror automatically from raw .deb files... but i think in your case apt-proxy could probably be a better choice
2006-02-26T12:19:00.000Z	LjL	JoKo	from apt-proxy's features list: "builds up a partial mirror directory automatically, with exactly the same directory structure and filenames as the original mirror."  --- seems like what you need
2006-02-26T12:20:00.000Z	JoKo	LjL	ok thanks
2006-02-26T12:20:00.000Z	LjL	JoKo	note that you can use "apt-get --download-only install blah" to import packages into apt-proxy that you do *not* want installed on your net-connected laptop
2006-02-26T12:21:00.000Z	JoKo	LjL	thanks for the tip... Very useful indeed
