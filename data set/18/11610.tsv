2006-09-23T16:27:00.000Z	Gasten		If my computer seems to be slower than it were on windoes 98, and programs (even nautilus) take long time to boot, would you suggest me to change the desctop eviroment from Gnome to Xfce? anything else?
2006-09-23T16:27:00.000Z	Asc	Gasten	first try a 'sudo hdparm /dev/hda' and see if DMA is working
2006-09-23T16:29:00.000Z	Gasten	Asc	I have done it. how do I tell if it's working?
2006-09-23T16:29:00.000Z	Asc	Gasten	look at the line that says 'using_dma' and see if it says 'on' or 'off'
2006-09-23T16:30:00.000Z	Gasten	Asc	Ah, there. I didn't see it. it is using DMA. I'll look into switching then. For a while.
2006-09-23T16:30:00.000Z	Gasten	Asc	thanks.
2006-09-23T16:31:00.000Z	Asc	Gasten	actually, I was thinking that maybe it was slow because DMA was disabled.
2006-09-23T16:31:00.000Z	Asc	Gasten	Hm.  How fast is your computer, out of curiosity?
2006-09-23T16:32:00.000Z	Gasten	Asc	1 x Pentium III (Coppermine) @ 733MHz
2006-09-23T16:33:00.000Z	Asc	Gasten	well, that is odd.  I was using a P3 coppermine at 500 mhz and it worked fine with gnome.
2006-09-23T16:34:00.000Z	Asc	Gasten	is it, like, problematicly slow, or does it just take 10-15 seconds for things to start?
2006-09-23T16:34:00.000Z	Gasten	Asc	Oh, I didn't say it didn't work fine. I just wanna see if it can work Better.
2006-09-23T16:35:00.000Z	Gasten	Asc	it takes more like... 5-15 sec.
2006-09-23T16:35:00.000Z	Gasten	Asc	maybe I'm just whiney for nothing.
2006-09-23T16:36:00.000Z	Asc	Gasten	Da.  Da.  Well, in my experience, the desktop environment doesn't affect much except RAM usage.  If you want a really minimal window manager though, I'd recommend ion.
2006-09-23T16:36:00.000Z	Asc	Gasten	It might or might not be faster, I haven't really used gnome in a long time
2006-09-23T16:36:00.000Z	Gasten	Asc	Ok. Thne Ithink I'll stick to gnome. No need to hassle.
2006-09-23T16:39:00.000Z	Asc	Gasten	Da.  Try the clearlooks theme.  It may or may not affect speed in any way.
