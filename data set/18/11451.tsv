2006-07-28T05:37:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	minew	Here .. http://www.cs.rit.edu/~css8044/?q=mythtv .. scroll down a few until you see "configuring TV-out" .. you "should be able to add that to your xorg.conf file (/etc/X11/xorg.conf) .. back it up first though (cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.bak), then if you restart X and get CLI you can copy the saved xorg.conf back ..

2006-07-28T06:05:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	minew	you rinning two cards?
2006-07-28T06:07:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	minew	how come you need to switch? I mean unless you are running two cards, only one will work? agp or pci .. lspci will show you agp as well (Don't let that confuse you) .. your nvidia card should be agp (I run an FX5700 in this box, and an FX5500 in my other, both with TV out.. I just change my xorg.conf and switch between tv and dvi/analog)
2006-07-28T06:12:00.000Z	NineTeen67Comet	minew	if you are only wanting to check your video, you can just restart X .. the messy way .. ctrl+alt+backspace ..
