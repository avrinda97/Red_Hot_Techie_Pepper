2008-05-15T04:20:00.000Z	dpnoid	clintchance	new user?
2008-05-15T04:17:00.000Z	dpnoid	clintchance	played with your sudoers file recently?
2008-05-15T04:23:00.000Z	dpnoid	clintchance	echo foo | sudo tee -a /file/name
2008-05-15T04:24:00.000Z	dpnoid	clintchance	do what I told you :p
2008-05-15T04:24:00.000Z	dpnoid	clintchance	echo foo | sudo tee -a /file/name
2008-05-15T05:39:00.000Z	dpnoid	clintchance	the atheros support in 8.04 is madwifi
2008-05-15T05:39:00.000Z	clintchance	dpnoid	are you talking about ubuntu 8.04?
2008-05-15T05:40:00.000Z	dpnoid	clintchance	that's... too bad
2008-05-15T05:41:00.000Z	dpnoid	clintchance	run lspci|grep -i net
2008-05-15T05:41:00.000Z	dpnoid	clintchance	is that a very new machine?
2008-05-15T05:42:00.000Z	dpnoid	clintchance	are you running 8.04 or 7.10?
2008-05-15T05:42:00.000Z	clintchance	dpnoid	7.04
2008-05-15T05:43:00.000Z	dpnoid	clintchance	well, I probably can't help you then :p
2008-05-15T05:43:00.000Z	dpnoid	clintchance	you might have better luck if you either reinstall -> 8.04, or upgrade to 7.10 and then to 8.04
2008-05-15T05:44:00.000Z	dpnoid	clintchance	if you don't mind reinstalling, then just download the 8.04 livecd and install from that;  otherwise, the upgrade-manager should be able to handle upgrading you to 7.10, and then to 8.04 after that
2008-05-15T05:45:00.000Z	dpnoid	clintchance	still no guarentee it'll work, but at least you'll have a better chance of getting good help
2008-05-15T05:46:00.000Z	dpnoid	clintchance	yes, do it
