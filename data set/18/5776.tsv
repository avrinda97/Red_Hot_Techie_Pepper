2008-08-24T09:15:00.000Z	tyg13	squidly	Yeah, but I'm suspicious of running anything in wine that I don't have to

2008-08-24T09:15:00.000Z	squidly	tyg13	usualy wine works well for me
2008-08-24T09:16:00.000Z	tyg13	squidly	It does, its just that my experiences with Windows over the last 10 years make me want to be COMPLETELY Windows Free
2008-08-24T09:17:00.000Z	tyg13	squidly	Plus not everything runs perfect under wWine.
