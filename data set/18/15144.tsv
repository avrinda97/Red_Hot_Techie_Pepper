2005-08-04T07:33:00.000Z	foxiness	hondje	haha nice :)
2005-08-04T07:35:00.000Z	foxiness	hondje	what the tools you use to build GUI
2005-08-04T07:36:00.000Z	hondje	foxiness	I use qt designer and C++
2005-08-04T07:36:00.000Z	hondje	foxiness	Or GUIDE/Simulink and Matlab
2005-08-04T07:37:00.000Z	foxiness	hondje	is there tools for gnome like qt designer?
2005-08-04T07:38:00.000Z	hondje	foxiness	I'm not really sure...I think glade/glade2 make GUIs, but I'm not a programmer, just someone who gets bored sometimes :)
