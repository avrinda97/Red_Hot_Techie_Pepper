2009-08-26T01:55:00.000Z	LinuX2half		hey I had a problem with my wireless connection, last time I connect to the wireless network but not connected to the internet
2009-08-26T01:55:00.000Z	LinuX2half		hey, I want to ask why I can't access the internet when I'n connected to my wireless network
2009-08-26T01:56:00.000Z	LinuX2half		hey, I want to ask why I can't access the internet when I'n connected to my wireless network
2009-08-26T01:57:00.000Z	LinuX2half		Mteck, yes
2009-08-26T01:59:00.000Z	LinuX2half		Mteck, yes I'll paste it for you http://paste.ubuntu.com/259499/
2009-08-26T02:01:00.000Z	LinuX2half		Mteck, I think that it had no internet activity when I'm connected
2009-08-26T02:01:00.000Z	LinuX2half		Mteck, I'm afraid that it might happen again.
2009-08-26T02:02:00.000Z	LinuX2half		Mteck, why a network doesn't emit any internet activity? Is it because too much computers are stealing the bandwith
2009-08-26T02:03:00.000Z	LinuX2half		Mteck, so had you found out any reason why?
2009-08-26T02:04:00.000Z	LinuX2half		Mteck, well today I restarted the computer 2 times maybe 3 and it doesn't help but then shut it down. Restarted it and so it worked how come?
2009-08-26T02:05:00.000Z	MTeck	LinuX2half	it could have been a massive range of things - too hard to pinpoint without the issue being there
2009-08-26T01:56:00.000Z	MTeck	LinuX2half	can you ping the router?
2009-08-26T01:57:00.000Z	MTeck	LinuX2half	what happens if you dig google.com
2009-08-26T02:01:00.000Z	MTeck	LinuX2half	then you're getting to the internet just fine...
2009-08-26T02:02:00.000Z	MTeck	LinuX2half	it could have been a fluke it wasn't working - no reason to worry now
2009-08-26T02:03:00.000Z	MTeck	LinuX2half	I'd have to have been there to investigate it
2009-08-26T02:03:00.000Z	MTeck	LinuX2half	don't worry unless it happens again
2009-08-26T02:08:00.000Z	MTeck	LinuX2half	Like I said - without it happening again, it's hard to track down
