2011-10-17T00:41:00.000Z	keith_linux123		theres a Ubuntu distro for that
2011-10-17T00:42:00.000Z	keith_linux123		standard ubuntu should do well, just install apps from the app center
2011-10-17T00:42:00.000Z	keith_linux123		no

2011-10-17T00:43:00.000Z	keith_linux123		try switching to unity 2d
2011-10-17T00:43:00.000Z	superlou	keith_linux123	i apologize for being so vague, still trying to pin down repeatable conditions
2011-10-17T00:44:00.000Z	superlou	keith_linux123	that's sort of a nuclear option, but good idea.  I wonder if it will behave the same.  I will miss wobly windows though
2011-10-17T00:44:00.000Z	keith_linux123		superlou
2011-10-17T00:44:00.000Z	keith_linux123		its a great option
2011-10-17T00:44:00.000Z	keith_linux123		I tired gnome3.  but for now its all distorted
2011-10-17T00:45:00.000Z	superlou	keith_linux123	that's sad to hear.  There's so much good stuff with 11.10 that it's a shame the launcher is buggy, but it might just be my setup I guess
2011-10-17T00:45:00.000Z	keith_linux123	superlou	just use Unity 2d
2011-10-17T00:46:00.000Z	keith_linux123		I installed Gnome3 as a backup , which incuilds gnome class
2011-10-17T00:46:00.000Z	keith_linux123		gnome classic
2011-10-17T00:46:00.000Z	superlou	keith_linux123	i like the 3d effects.  i'm hoping i just need to wait for updates to come through.  time to try 2d though
