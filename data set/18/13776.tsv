2005-10-14T14:12:00.000Z	frickel		Does someone know how to install and use a font for Xterm??
2005-10-14T14:12:00.000Z	nalioth	frickel	install all your xfont pkgs
2005-10-14T14:12:00.000Z	frickel	nalioth	ok, I try
2005-10-14T14:17:00.000Z	frickel	nalioth	is there something else to do?
2005-10-15T16:40:00.000Z	nalioth	frickel	yes, change hoary to breezy
2005-10-15T16:41:00.000Z	frickel	nalioth	so I can change every hoary to breezy? also the hoary-update?
2005-10-15T16:43:00.000Z	frickel	nalioth	I know this page, but this html only tells to change this entry: deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ hoary main restricted
2005-10-15T16:44:00.000Z	nalioth	frickel	every place you see "hoary" change it. dont use backports (they are not up yet for breezy)
2005-10-15T16:45:00.000Z	frickel	nalioth	what do you mean: no backports?
2005-10-15T16:45:00.000Z	nalioth	frickel	backports are not out for breezy, yet. having them in your sources.list is useless at this time
2005-10-15T16:46:00.000Z	frickel	nalioth	ok, thx nalioth
2005-10-15T16:50:00.000Z	nalioth	frickel	you need to identify to services to use ubotu effectively
2005-10-15T16:50:00.000Z	frickel	nalioth	how can I identify to services
2005-10-15T16:50:00.000Z	nalioth	frickel	/msg nickserv help register
2005-10-16T15:02:00.000Z	nalioth	frickel	enable universe and multiverse
2005-10-16T15:02:00.000Z	nalioth	frickel	you'll be a happier ubuntu user
2005-10-16T15:03:00.000Z	frickel	nalioth	could you give me the line for sources.text
