2007-04-05T08:31:00.000Z	jrib	kuma	how do you run it from the console?
2007-04-05T08:31:00.000Z	kuma	jrib	i type the name of the application
2007-04-05T08:32:00.000Z	jrib	kuma	which the_name_of_the_application     will tell you
2007-04-05T08:41:00.000Z	jrib	kuma	if you can't cd to /usr/bin you have a broken system...
2007-04-05T08:42:00.000Z	jrib	kuma	pastebin exactly what you are doing including all the output
2007-04-05T08:42:00.000Z	kuma	jrib	ikonia: i'll paste bin
2007-04-28T07:04:00.000Z	jrib	kuma	I am guessing libxml1
2007-04-28T07:05:00.000Z	kuma	jrib	i think i just installed
2007-04-28T07:05:00.000Z	kuma	jrib	it
2007-04-28T07:05:00.000Z	jrib	kuma	apt-cache policy libxml1
2007-04-28T07:05:00.000Z	kuma	jrib	i ran this  apt-get install libxml++1.0-dev
2007-04-28T07:05:00.000Z	jrib	kuma	right, that's not what I suggested
2007-04-28T07:06:00.000Z	jrib	kuma	are you on feisty?
2007-04-28T07:06:00.000Z	kuma	jrib	ok, running what you suggested xD
2007-04-28T07:06:00.000Z	kuma	jrib	nope, 6.06
2007-04-28T07:07:00.000Z	kuma	jrib	looks like it's working, thanks :)
