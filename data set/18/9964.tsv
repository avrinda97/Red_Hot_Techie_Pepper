2007-01-28T12:03:00.000Z	bulmer	chris_shafto	you need to see the ./Makefile and see the install target
2007-01-28T12:03:00.000Z	chris_shafto	bulmer	what mate?
2007-01-28T12:03:00.000Z	chris_shafto	bulmer	see the install target?
2007-01-28T12:04:00.000Z	bulmer	chris_shafto	for the make to work, it has to have the specified target in the Makefile
2007-01-28T12:05:00.000Z	chris_shafto	bulmer	how i make a specified target/
2007-01-28T12:06:00.000Z	bulmer	chris_shafto	I can not teach you how to create the Makefile here..you need to google for a tutorial on Makefile and configure, and autotools
2007-01-28T12:06:00.000Z	chris_shafto	bulmer	it already has a Makefile mate, just cant get it to execute right
2007-01-28T12:06:00.000Z	bulmer	chris_shafto	you can find an existing Makefile on the current system and take a look inside it
2007-01-28T12:07:00.000Z	bulmer	chris_shafto	edit the Makefile and look for  'install' in the first column
2007-01-28T12:07:00.000Z	chris_shafto	bulmer	the program i want to install already has a makefile in the folder but i just cant seem to execute it correctly to make the program install
2007-01-28T12:08:00.000Z	bulmer	chris_shafto	you can use vim to edit a Makefile, and look inside it for the "install" target
2007-01-28T12:09:00.000Z	chris_shafto	bulmer	install:: $(FILES_TO_INSTALL)
2007-01-28T12:10:00.000Z	bulmer	chris_shafto	that dont looked right,  each target should only have one  ":"
