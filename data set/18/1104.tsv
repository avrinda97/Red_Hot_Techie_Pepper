2012-01-30T17:39:00.000Z	CaptainQuirk		hardware problem, driver issue ?
2012-01-30T17:40:00.000Z	Ben64	CaptainQuirk	you should provide details so someone can try to help you. wireless chipset, laptop model, etc
2012-01-30T17:41:00.000Z	CaptainQuirk		hp pavillon g6, ubuntu 10.04, realtek wireless controller
2012-01-30T17:41:00.000Z	CaptainQuirk	Ben64	when I do ifconfig, I don't have any wlan section
2012-01-30T17:41:00.000Z	Ben64		well that is a problem... which realtek chip
2012-01-30T17:43:00.000Z	CaptainQuirk		don't remember
2012-01-30T17:44:00.000Z	Ben64	CaptainQuirk	you can probably check from "lspci | grep -i rtl"
2012-01-30T17:44:00.000Z	CaptainQuirk		well, I don't have anything else than an ethernet controller
2012-01-30T17:45:00.000Z	Ben64		lspci will show it even if it doesn't show up under ifconfig
2012-01-30T17:45:00.000Z	CaptainQuirk	Ben64	I have Three entries with lspci | grep Realtek
2012-01-30T17:45:00.000Z	CaptainQuirk		Network controller, Ethernet controller and something called Class ff00
2012-01-30T17:46:00.000Z	CaptainQuirk		weird
2012-01-30T17:46:00.000Z	Ben64	CaptainQuirk	try "rtl" instead of "Realtek"
2012-01-30T17:47:00.000Z	CaptainQuirk		only thing i get with lspci | grep "RTL" is the ethernet controller
