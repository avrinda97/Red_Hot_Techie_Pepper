2010-10-07T02:46:00.000Z	sresu		Can Ubuntu LiveUSB store data?
2010-10-07T02:48:00.000Z	bastidrazor	sresu	if during the creation of the liveUSB you allocated space for file storage, yes. if you did not then no.
2010-10-07T02:48:00.000Z	sresu	bastidrazor	How can I do that for Ubuntu Live USB?
2010-10-07T02:50:00.000Z	sresu	bastidrazor	How I allocate space for file storage as well?
2010-10-07T02:50:00.000Z	bastidrazor	sresu	you're creating the liveUSB from Ubuntu?
2010-10-07T02:51:00.000Z	sresu	bastidrazor	No. I initailly tried that but startup creater. But then used INetbootin
2010-10-07T02:51:00.000Z	sresu	bastidrazor	UNetbootin
2010-10-07T02:52:00.000Z	sresu	bastidrazor	There exists in one of the applications to allocate file storage but don't remember exactly
2010-10-07T02:53:00.000Z	bastidrazor	sresu	i do not know from unetbootin, if you're in Ubuntu while creating the USB it shows you space left and gives you the chance to use it or not.
2010-10-07T02:53:00.000Z	sresu	bastidrazor	Are you talking about Startup-Disk creater?
2010-10-07T02:54:00.000Z	bastidrazor	sresu	yes.
2010-10-07T02:54:00.000Z	bastidrazor	sresu	this is during the creation of the USB but not while ON the liveUSB
2010-10-07T02:59:00.000Z	sresu	bastidrazor	For 2gb drive, it allowed to have around 1.2 gb of space to be left. And I chose 500mb. Its syncing and creating bootloader now.. fine?
2010-10-07T03:01:00.000Z	sresu	bastidrazor	1.2 gb of space for documents and settings, I mean...
2010-10-07T03:01:00.000Z	bastidrazor	sresu	are you trying to create this while booted from the liveUSB or from a harddrive install of Ubuntu?
2010-10-07T03:02:00.000Z	sresu	bastidrazor	Ha.. obviously from a running system. I'm on Ubuntu now using hdd and not squashfs :)
2011-01-02T19:34:00.000Z	bastidrazor	sresu	in terminal du -sh
