2005-01-13T11:08:00.000Z	nuOpus	u	what do you mean:
2005-01-13T11:08:00.000Z	nuOpus	u	you can do it in synaptic or by editing the /etc/apt/sources.list file
2005-01-13T11:10:00.000Z	nuOpus	u	You just need to click reload
2005-01-13T11:10:00.000Z	nuOpus	u	reloading will go the the repositories you added and download the new headers.
2005-01-13T11:11:00.000Z	nuOpus	u	let me know if that solves your problem

2005-01-13T11:16:00.000Z	u	nuOpus	so how do i configure smb after it's installed?
2005-01-13T11:16:00.000Z	nuOpus	u	Well there are a few ways. Do you want just to set up a simple share?
2005-01-13T11:17:00.000Z	nuOpus	u	You can use SWAT, install WebMin and configure that way ... or if you are using Hoary there is a GUI configuration tool for shares
2005-01-13T11:19:00.000Z	nuOpus	u	go to synaptic and install webmin-samba
2005-01-13T11:22:00.000Z	nuOpus	u	now open up a web browser and type https://localhost:10000
