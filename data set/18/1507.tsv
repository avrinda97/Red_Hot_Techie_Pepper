2012-04-28T21:50:00.000Z	uzf		finally, 500+KB/sec download speed
2012-04-28T21:52:00.000Z	uzf		!fserve
2012-04-28T21:52:00.000Z	uzf		hehe
2012-04-28T21:52:00.000Z	uzf		13 mins remain.... this has taken 5 hours
2012-04-28T21:54:00.000Z	uzf		not going to fresh install if I can help it ever, I have too many things installed and files I dont want to lose
2012-04-28T21:54:00.000Z	uzf		backing them up isn't exactly an ideal choice
2012-04-28T21:55:00.000Z	uzf		hard drives never go bad
2012-04-28T21:56:00.000Z	ThinkT510	uzf	if you don't keep backups then you don't value your data
2012-04-28T21:56:00.000Z	uzf		I have backups, I just think that you should be able to update to a latest distrib without pain
2012-04-28T21:57:00.000Z	uzf		fresh install isn't an option for any business system most of the time
2012-04-28T21:57:00.000Z	ThinkT510	uzf	maybe you should move to a rolling release distro
2012-04-28T21:57:00.000Z	uzf		neither is spending time backing up everything
2012-04-28T21:57:00.000Z	uzf		I like ubuntu too much
2012-04-28T21:58:00.000Z	uzf		yeah, winxp is awesome for that reason only
2012-04-28T21:58:00.000Z	uzf		no one will move past it or buy new microsoft crap
2012-04-28T21:59:00.000Z	uzf		didn't winxp come out in like 1995?
2012-04-28T21:59:00.000Z	uzf	ok	so I was off a year or two
2012-04-28T21:59:00.000Z	ThinkT510	uzf	2001, and we are getting off-topic
