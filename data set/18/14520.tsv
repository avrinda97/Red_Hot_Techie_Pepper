2006-11-24T15:02:00.000Z	Kengur		hi
2006-11-24T15:02:00.000Z	Kengur		can anyone help with network problem?
2006-11-24T15:04:00.000Z	Kengur		i get a ADSL over PPPoE, so i basically have a eithernet connection, and i have constant network getting down for no reason
2006-11-24T15:04:00.000Z	Jowi	Kengur	so the connection works but disconnects after awhile?
2006-11-24T15:04:00.000Z	Kengur		dmesg says something like this...  Neighbour table overflow.  printk: 15 messages suppressed.
2006-11-24T15:05:00.000Z	Kengur	Jowi	yes, i use torrent most of the time at 90 percent of my bandwidth, that's it
2006-11-24T15:05:00.000Z	Jowi	Kengur	does it only disconnect when using high bandwidth?
2006-11-24T15:06:00.000Z	Kengur		um, dunno, does the dmesg log says anything that might give a clue?
2006-11-24T15:06:00.000Z	Kengur		Neighbour table overflow.  printk: 15 messages suppressed.
2006-11-24T15:07:00.000Z	Kengur		i mean it usually get's down when i'm not around, so i can't say if it's actively downloading or not
2006-11-24T15:07:00.000Z	Jowi	Kengur	not sure. Maybe it is possible to change the MTU value in the modem. depends on modem to modem. if you can login to a web based setup page in the modem it should be possible to change some values. but you need to contact your ISP to see which MTU or other settings that should be there.
2006-11-24T15:09:00.000Z	Kengur	Jowi	the problem is it never appeared under windows or fedora core
2006-11-24T15:10:00.000Z	Jowi	Kengur	disconnections can be tough to troubleshoot. see if you can use a livecd (of fedora or something) to see if the problem exist there. if not, it is something wrong with the driver. if the same problem exist, contact your isp.
2006-11-24T15:11:00.000Z	Kengur	Jowi	can it be that someone outside is trying to bring the connection down? may be i need a firewall or smthng?
2006-11-24T15:11:00.000Z	Jowi	Kengur	not likely.
2006-11-24T15:11:00.000Z	Jowi	Kengur	might be a problem with A. settings or driver or B. hardware (filter, modem, cables)
2006-11-24T15:13:00.000Z	Kengur	Jowi	i didn't have this problem under fedora core, so it might be ubuntu thingy =(
2006-11-24T15:13:00.000Z	Jowi	Kengur	might be. hard for me to make an oppinion about at this moment unfortunatly
