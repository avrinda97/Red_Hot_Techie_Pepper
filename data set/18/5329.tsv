2011-06-07T01:20:00.000Z	zooko		Folks: does anyone know how to tell Ubuntu/Gnome to use the Splix driver and not the GDI driver for my Samsung laser printer?
2011-06-07T01:20:00.000Z	zooko		I have the "splix" package installed, but it doesn't seem to come with a PPD file.
2011-06-07T01:21:00.000Z	robin0800	zooko	what about a cups driver?
2011-06-07T01:24:00.000Z	zooko	robin0800	Um, I don't think cups is a type of driver, is it? In any case openprinting.org suggests splix, and I've used splix successfully in the past with this printer, and the current gdi driver is not working.
2011-06-07T01:27:00.000Z	robin0800	zooko	brother recommend using the linux built in cups system for their printers
2011-06-07T01:27:00.000Z	zooko	robin0800	this is not a brother printer. Cups is not a driver.
2011-06-07T01:28:00.000Z	zooko		Hm, the PPD used to be in the package: http://packages.ubuntu.com/lucid/amd64/splix/filelist but now it is generated on install: http://packages.ubuntu.com/natty/amd64/splix/filelist
2011-06-07T01:28:00.000Z	robin0800	zooko	cups is a linux system
2011-06-07T01:28:00.000Z	zooko		But it doesn't seem to be present on my system.
2011-06-07T01:28:00.000Z	zooko		Although I'm not sure precisely what directory it would be in.
2011-06-07T01:28:00.000Z	zooko	robin0800	thanks anyway, but your suggestions are not helping.
2011-06-07T01:30:00.000Z	robin0800	zooko	if you open printers and then properties you can see and change the driver there
2011-06-07T01:31:00.000Z	zooko	robin0800	thanks. I already knew that much.
2011-06-07T01:31:00.000Z	zooko		Hm, it seems like the ppd really ought to show up in /usr/share/ppd/splix, but no such directory is created when I purge and reinstall splix...
2011-06-07T01:34:00.000Z	robin0800	zooko	use the terminal to install splix and see if there are any error messages
2011-06-07T01:38:00.000Z	zooko	robin0800	thanks again, but I've already used a terminal to apt-get install splix and see if there were any error messages. There were none.
2011-06-07T01:41:00.000Z	robin0800	zooko	any linux help on samsung's site?
2011-06-07T01:42:00.000Z	zooko	robin0800	I haven't looked at Samsung's site--I definitely want to use the open source splix drivers instead of drivers provided by the company if I can help it. I've opened a ticket with Ubuntu: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/splix/+bug/793741
