2006-01-07T10:11:00.000Z	Inf3ctedFx		is anyone familiar with the VMWare? I just go a few questions on the configuration regarding the kernel-headers
2006-01-07T10:11:00.000Z	Hendikins	Inf3ctedFx	Don't ask to ask, just ask (-:
2006-01-07T10:13:00.000Z	Hendikins	Inf3ctedFx	Have you upgraded your kernel since installing vmware?
2006-01-07T10:15:00.000Z	Hendikins	Inf3ctedFx	Do you remember running vmware-config.pl?
2006-01-07T10:16:00.000Z	Hendikins	Inf3ctedFx	Leave that as default.
2006-01-07T10:18:00.000Z	Hendikins	Inf3ctedFx	Remember to use http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org for pasting
2006-01-07T10:19:00.000Z	Inf3ctedFx	Hendikins	 I dont have "include" in that folder
2006-01-07T10:20:00.000Z	Hendikins	Inf3ctedFx	and uname -a says you're running which kernel version?
2006-01-07T10:21:00.000Z	Inf3ctedFx	Hendikins	 Linux fx 2.6.12-10-686 #1 Thu Dec 22 11:55:07 UTC 2005 i686 GNU/Linux
2006-01-07T10:22:00.000Z	Hendikins	Inf3ctedFx	Hrm. Ubuntu isn't my native distro, so I'm not really sure what to suggest. Do you have the kernel sources installed?
2006-01-07T10:23:00.000Z	Hendikins	Inf3ctedFx	I'm a SuSE user myself. I've been working on some ubuntu-specific bits for some documentation I write, hence being in here.
2006-01-07T10:25:00.000Z	Hendikins	Inf3ctedFx	You're running 5.5?
2006-01-07T11:03:00.000Z	Inf3ctedFx	Hendikins	 look I run vmware pretty good but now I'm trying to install windows and I have a message said: you do not have VMware Tools installed"   do u know anything about it?
2006-01-07T11:04:00.000Z	Hendikins	Inf3ctedFx	Yeah, that's normal. Just finish installing Windows, then install VMware tools.
