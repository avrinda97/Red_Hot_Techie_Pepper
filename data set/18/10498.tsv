2006-11-29T11:53:00.000Z	AnthonyG		These martian modem drivers give open source a bad name...
2006-11-29T11:54:00.000Z	AnthonyG		The GNOME I am running does no such thing :)
2006-11-29T11:54:00.000Z	AnthonyG		It simply runs them
2006-11-29T11:54:00.000Z	Cas	AnthonyG	neh, they give those closed source/documentation vendors a bad name.
2006-11-29T11:55:00.000Z	AnthonyG	Cas	I distribute my source better than them , Therefore these particular developers==Bad.
2006-11-29T11:55:00.000Z	AnthonyG		I attempted to compile the modem drivers at least six times , And got two errors.
2006-11-29T11:56:00.000Z	AnthonyG		So now I'm forced to rollback until I get the right one.
2006-11-29T11:56:00.000Z	AnthonyG		All this rebooting can't be good for my machine.
2006-11-29T11:56:00.000Z	Cas	AnthonyG	I see, compiling errors, or kernel errors?
2006-11-29T11:57:00.000Z	AnthonyG	Cas	Compilation errors fortunately :D
2006-11-29T11:57:00.000Z	Cas	AnthonyG	post them on pastebin, maybe somebody can give a solution
2006-11-29T11:58:00.000Z	AnthonyG	Cas	I know what the error is , but I'm not willing to fix it.
2006-11-29T11:58:00.000Z	AnthonyG	Cas	Syntax error , Plain and simple.
2006-11-29T11:58:00.000Z	Cas		hmmz
2006-11-29T11:59:00.000Z	Cas	AnthonyG	you could buy another modem :P
2006-11-29T11:59:00.000Z	AnthonyG	Cas	Lol , How about you buy me one, Then I shall give in :).
2006-11-29T12:00:00.000Z	Cas	AnthonyG	 Neh, I rather wait and hope you fix the problem in the source, that way everybody wins ;)
