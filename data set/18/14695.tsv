2005-06-25T15:16:00.000Z	HappyFool	Bauhn^DH	did you try 'fdisk /mbr' ?
2005-06-25T15:16:00.000Z	Bauhn^DH	HappyFool	could it work when i've booted up windows normally?
2005-06-25T15:16:00.000Z	HappyFool	Bauhn^DH	hmm, that's an idea actually
2005-06-25T15:17:00.000Z	HappyFool	Bauhn^DH	let me see if fdisk is on my xp partition...
2005-06-25T15:17:00.000Z	Bauhn^DH	HappyFool	i've booted windows reguarly now, but none of the commands exist
2005-06-25T15:18:00.000Z	HappyFool	Bauhn^DH	yeah, i can't find fdisk.exe or fixmbr.exe on my windows partition
2005-06-25T15:18:00.000Z	HappyFool		i wonder if i have that oem cd somewhere
2005-06-25T15:18:00.000Z	Bauhn^DH	HappyFool	would it work if you uploaded them somewhere and i run them on my computer?
2005-06-25T15:20:00.000Z	HappyFool	Bauhn^DH	i'm not helluva sure where my windows cd is. i don't think i've even unwrapped it
2005-06-25T15:20:00.000Z	Bauhn^DH	HappyFool	but isnt fdisk & fixmbr in ubuntu?
2005-06-25T15:20:00.000Z	HappyFool	Bauhn^DH	no. they are windows commands
2005-06-25T15:20:00.000Z	HappyFool	Bauhn^DH	there is a linux fdisk, but it's different
2005-06-25T15:21:00.000Z	HappyFool	Bauhn^DH	it doesn't know about windows boot records
2005-06-25T15:21:00.000Z	Bauhn^DH	HappyFool	ok, i'll google a bit after the files
2005-06-25T15:25:00.000Z	Bauhn^DH	HappyFool	where on the windows-cd should the files be located?
2005-06-25T15:25:00.000Z	HappyFool	Bauhn^DH	eek
2005-06-25T15:26:00.000Z	HappyFool	Bauhn^DH	um, dunno
