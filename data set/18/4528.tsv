2010-01-22T09:16:00.000Z	tweaksource		Windows install disk won't touch ext3
2010-01-22T09:17:00.000Z	developer	tweaksource	windows installation can delete ext3 partitions
2010-01-22T09:18:00.000Z	tweaksource	developer	Ok. I've never seen it recognize one.
2010-01-22T09:19:00.000Z	developer	tweaksource	it will show the ext3 partitions as unrecognized...but we can easily delete it
2010-01-22T09:19:00.000Z	tweaksource	developer	You are right. I stand corrected.
2010-01-22T09:19:00.000Z	developer	tweaksource	even from a running windows we can see the partitions as unknown and healthy :)
2010-01-22T09:20:00.000Z	tweaksource		True, but  I usually only see ntfs from Ubuntu.
2010-01-22T09:20:00.000Z	tweaksource	developer	 I forget.
2010-01-22T09:20:00.000Z	tweaksource	developer	Only have Win in VBox now.
2010-01-22T09:21:00.000Z	developer	tweaksource	ok..
2010-01-22T09:22:00.000Z	developer	tweaksource	are u using VBOX OSE??
2010-01-22T09:24:00.000Z	tweaksource	developer	I don't think so. Not from the repos. Would it say OSE?
2010-01-22T09:24:00.000Z	developer	tweaksource	from the repos the give OSE-OpenSourceEdition
2010-01-22T09:25:00.000Z	developer	tweaksource	you might have taken from SUN's site
2010-01-22T09:26:00.000Z	tweaksource	developer	It is not OSE. I did download from Sun. Why do you ask?
2010-01-22T09:26:00.000Z	developer	tweaksource	i heard that the OSE version doesnt support USB sharing yet...wanted to know whether if they corrected it or not
2010-01-22T09:27:00.000Z	tweaksource	developer	Last I tried (a few months ago) there was no USB support. That's why I use the other.
2010-01-22T09:28:00.000Z	developer	tweaksource	ok...by the way do you customize your distro....are you a customize maniac like me??
