2009-03-25T07:31:00.000Z	aranyik		I have an old computer on which I have installed DOS, now I would like to install Xubuntu but the only way I could is by taking the HDD and plug it with a IDE-USB adapter to my laptop...I've tried to install directly on it with my laptop but then back in the old PC, it seems that the MBR cant be written by the way I proceed, so I guess I have to manual install Xubuntu into this HDD. But then, will the MBR written by my previous DOS install will be able to
2009-03-25T07:31:00.000Z	aranyik		 point to a series of boot files and finally linux intalled files?
2009-03-25T07:32:00.000Z	Cpudan80	aranyik	you cant just boot off of the install CD ?
2009-03-25T07:35:00.000Z	Cpudan80	aranyik	so you boot off the live CD using the laptop and then point the installer to the USB device ?
2009-03-25T07:37:00.000Z	aranyik	Cpudan80	yes thats what I already did, but it didnt work the first time so I guess the adapter messed up the process of writting the MBR somehow, or maybe ...wait I remember having MBR problem at this time...maybe now that its fixed I could try again..
2009-03-25T07:38:00.000Z	Cpudan80	aranyik	yeah thats not going to work - the installer will write the MBR to the laptop HDD by default
2009-03-25T07:38:00.000Z	Cpudan80	aranyik	you need to tell the installer where to write the MBR to, I believe thats an option in there somewhere (an advanced option)
2009-03-25T07:39:00.000Z	aranyik	Cpudan80	ohh! yes I know that option...I think I just totaly forgot...or maybe i tried...but it worth to try ?again?
2009-03-25T07:39:00.000Z	aranyik	Cpudan80	thanks, I try and come back after
2009-03-25T07:39:00.000Z	Cpudan80	aranyik	if that doesn't work - mount it using a VM
2009-03-25T07:40:00.000Z	Cpudan80	aranyik	ex. install virtual box on the laptop - point the VM to the USB thing as the HDD
2009-03-25T07:42:00.000Z	aranyik	Cpudan80	I tried that already and got plenty of weird errors.. anyway..lets go back to method #1
2009-03-25T07:42:00.000Z	Cpudan80	aranyik	yeah the VM thing ... not an easy option
2009-03-25T07:43:00.000Z	aranyik	Cpudan80	oh wait...some very important stuf...if I run the installer with my laptop...
2009-03-25T07:44:00.000Z	aranyik	Cpudan80	it will configure Xubuntu for a recent laptop and then in my Pentium
2009-03-25T07:44:00.000Z	aranyik	Cpudan80	233Mhz.maybe its gonna ,..freeze or somth
2009-03-25T07:48:00.000Z	aranyik	Cpudan80	what do you think ??
2009-03-25T07:49:00.000Z	Cpudan80	aranyik	I think you should use that computer as a brick
