2010-05-29T19:00:00.000Z	realubot		Is there any way to keep the panels even using for example Firefox in fullscreen mode? I want to be able to run applications in fullscreen but still be able to see my panals. Is this possible?
2010-05-29T19:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	realubot	you could use tinymenu and a slim firefox theme like liquifox to get more screen realestate for browsing
2010-05-29T19:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	realubot	you can pretty much get all the useful stuff on a single line
2010-05-29T19:09:00.000Z	realubot	ActionParsnip	I use Vimperator and that gives me a pretty clean and usefull interference, but It would be great to use Fx in fullscreen without hiding the panels at the same time, almost like maximizing but not exactly.
2010-05-29T19:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	realubot	submit it in http://brainstorm.ubuntu.com ;)
2010-05-29T19:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	realubot	you can use tis sort of thing maybe to define the window size, not sure if its useful or not: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=482203
2010-05-29T19:12:00.000Z	realubot	ActionParsnip	I'll chek it out. Otherwise Unity Panel may be a solution. Is it working or are there many bugs?
2010-05-29T19:13:00.000Z	realubot	ActionParsnip	I doubt that the posts in the forums is a solution of my problem.
2010-05-29T19:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	realubot	submit a suggestion is all I can (funnily) suggest
2010-05-29T19:15:00.000Z	realubot	ActionParsnip	Mhm, this may not be a problem at all in gnome-shell, I don't know.
2010-07-08T04:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	realubot	if wine is giving you jip i'd ask in #winehq
2010-07-08T04:45:00.000Z	realubot	ActionParsnip	Not only Wine, the same problem occur playing games in Ubuntu and changing the resolution to like 640x480. The new desktop show up as a box in the old ones, having black area around it.
2010-07-13T12:02:00.000Z	realubot	ActionParsnip	Thanks for the tip, but I want to learn to use the Terminal as UI as much as possible. I'm just wondering how I input environmental variables to a script using crontab -e to set the cron job.
2010-09-19T02:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	realubot	i'd ask in #wine
2010-09-19T02:29:00.000Z	realubot	ActionParsnip	Ok, thanks.
2010-12-18T05:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	realubot	no you cna use this: http://idyllictux.wordpress.com/2010/04/26/lucidubuntu-10-04-high-resolution-plymouth-virtual-terminal-for-atinvidia-cards-with-proprietaryrestricted-driver/
2010-12-18T05:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	realubot	lets you define the res of the server screen :)
2010-12-18T05:38:00.000Z	realubot	ActionParsnip	I don't use ATI or nVidia cards. I'm running Ubuntu Server in vbox using my netbook as host. :)
