2009-08-25T03:42:00.000Z	EvilPenguin|		well
2009-08-25T03:42:00.000Z	Halitech	EvilPenguin|	which did you install? the 32bit or the 64bit? what drivers aren't being auto installed?
2009-08-25T03:43:00.000Z	Halitech	EvilPenguin|	which do you have installed currently?
2009-08-25T03:43:00.000Z	Halitech	EvilPenguin|	what video card do you have?
2009-08-25T03:44:00.000Z	Halitech	EvilPenguin|	if you go to System - Admin - Hard ware drivers, is anything there?
2009-08-25T03:45:00.000Z	Halitech	EvilPenguin|	ok, then you need to get the drivers from the nvidia website
2009-08-25T03:46:00.000Z	Halitech	EvilPenguin|	what didn't work? the install failed at some point or you still dont have the resolution you want or ???
2009-08-25T03:46:00.000Z	EvilPenguin|	Halitech	i want my drivers to autofind like the do on the LiveCD.. i have looked around for my drivers and nothing works...
2009-08-25T03:47:00.000Z	Halitech	EvilPenguin|	unfortunately that doesn't always work and you have to manually install them
2009-08-25T03:47:00.000Z	EvilPenguin|	Halitech	ok well then where do i get the netgearWN311B drivers?
2009-08-25T03:47:00.000Z	Halitech	EvilPenguin|	lets stick with 1 issue at a time
2009-08-25T03:49:00.000Z	EvilPenguin|	Halitech	ok cool
