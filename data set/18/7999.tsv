2007-10-15T05:18:00.000Z	arun		If I have a separate /home partition, how do i install gutsy so as to not overwrite the partition?
2007-10-15T05:18:00.000Z	Abanta	arun	don't mount it while choosing manual partition
2007-10-15T05:18:00.000Z	arun	Abanta	That's it?
2007-10-15T05:18:00.000Z	Abanta	arun	think so...
2007-10-15T05:19:00.000Z	Abanta	arun	just define a root partition and some swap
2007-10-15T05:25:00.000Z	Abanta	arun	you can use mplayer with -vo x11 i think
2007-10-15T05:26:00.000Z	Abanta	arun	that worked for me hehe
2007-10-15T05:27:00.000Z	arun	Abanta	But XV doesnt work? x11 video looks like crap
2007-10-15T05:27:00.000Z	Abanta	arun	why should it look like crap?
2007-10-15T05:27:00.000Z	Abanta	arun	it looks dope. i just needed another option that let me resize the window
2007-10-15T05:27:00.000Z	arun	Abanta	XV renders videos much better and uses less memory
2007-10-15T05:27:00.000Z	Abanta	arun	ah. didnt know that.
2007-10-15T05:27:00.000Z	Abanta	arun	maybe you find a way to use xv too
2007-10-15T05:27:00.000Z	arun	Abanta	are you using gutsy?
2007-10-15T05:28:00.000Z	Abanta	arun	since a few hours. yeah.
2007-10-15T05:29:00.000Z	arun	Abanta	and does xv video work for you with compiz enabled?
2007-10-15T05:29:00.000Z	Abanta	arun	it was either xv or x11 and it worked. yeah. gotta figure that out since i just reinstalled things here using gutsy.
2007-10-15T05:30:00.000Z	Abanta	arun	will keep you updated as i configure it...
