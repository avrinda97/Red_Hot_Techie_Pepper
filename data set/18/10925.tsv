2006-11-14T15:21:00.000Z	foreverconnected		linuxxy you have to setup a password for using samba
2006-11-14T15:21:00.000Z	foreverconnected		unfortunatley, I'm telling you that it will probably completely break samba
2006-11-14T15:21:00.000Z	foreverconnected		SAMBA in Edgy Eft is completely broken
2006-11-14T15:21:00.000Z	foreverconnected		and nobody here seems to know what's wrong
2006-11-14T15:23:00.000Z	foreverconnected		linuxxy you lucky duck
2006-11-14T15:23:00.000Z	foreverconnected		when I started samba
2006-11-14T15:23:00.000Z	foreverconnected		everything failed
2006-11-14T15:23:00.000Z	foreverconnected		and now I can't re-install it
2006-11-14T15:23:00.000Z	foreverconnected		and I don't know why
2006-11-14T15:24:00.000Z	ifireball	foreverconnected	can you ealborate on your problem so we can actaully try to help instead of being annoyed at your FUD?
2006-11-14T15:26:00.000Z	ifireball	foreverconnected	what error?
2006-11-14T15:28:00.000Z	ifireball	foreverconnected	uninstall and purge the package, then make sure you don't have a samba file in your /etc/init.d then try installing again
2006-11-14T15:34:00.000Z	ifireball	foreverconnected	like I just tole bokey those 2 functionalityes are almost completly unrelated
2006-11-14T15:35:00.000Z	ifireball	foreverconnected	did you try purging and reinstalling like I asked you to?
2006-11-14T15:46:00.000Z	ifireball	foreverconnected	I vaguly remebr a tool for Gnome that allows sharing via HTTP, I'll look it up, w8
2006-11-14T15:54:00.000Z	ifireball	foreverconnected	try gnome-user-share
2006-11-14T15:59:00.000Z	ifireball	foreverconnected	samba is the only SMB server for Linux, however, if you don't mind using another file sharing protocol, you have a few options
2006-11-14T16:01:00.000Z	ifireball	foreverconnected	not really, you can't use samba for much more then being an SMB server no not that many things depend on it
