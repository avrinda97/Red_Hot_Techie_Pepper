2005-06-16T13:46:00.000Z	chaps0063		hello, I am new to ubuntu and I was wondering how I can get k3b to burn cds because it says it is missing cdrdao.
2005-06-16T13:47:00.000Z	chaps0063		package cdrdao has no installation candidate
2005-06-16T13:49:00.000Z	HappyFool	chaps0063	cdrdao is in universe
2005-06-16T13:49:00.000Z	HappyFool	chaps0063	so you should be able to install it using synaptic
2005-06-16T13:49:00.000Z	chaps0063	HappyFool	never used synaptic
2005-06-16T13:50:00.000Z	HappyFool	chaps0063	are you running ubuntu or kubuntu ?
2005-06-16T13:50:00.000Z	HappyFool	chaps0063	how did you install k3b ?
2005-06-16T13:50:00.000Z	HappyFool	chaps0063	ok, well, you can use apt-get install for cdrdao as well
2005-06-16T13:51:00.000Z	chaps0063	HappyFool	I do that but then it tells me its not available.
2005-06-16T13:51:00.000Z	HappyFool	chaps0063	synaptic is just a GUI interface to similar functionality
2005-06-16T13:51:00.000Z	chaps0063	HappyFool	i see.
2005-06-16T13:51:00.000Z	HappyFool	chaps0063	you need to make sure 'universe' is enabled
2005-06-16T13:51:00.000Z	chaps0063	HappyFool	how do I go about that?
2005-06-16T13:51:00.000Z	HappyFool	chaps0063	i presume you edited /etc/apt/sources.list at some point ?
2005-06-16T13:51:00.000Z	chaps0063	HappyFool	this was all default, didn't edit it at all.
2005-06-16T13:52:00.000Z	chaps0063	HappyFool	ok, just uncommented them.
2005-06-16T13:52:00.000Z	chaps0063	HappyFool	thanks.,
2005-06-16T13:52:00.000Z	HappyFool	chaps0063	ok, apt-get update and apt-get install cdrdao, and you should be up and running
