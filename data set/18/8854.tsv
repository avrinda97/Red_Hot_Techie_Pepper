2008-01-04T01:10:00.000Z	unagi		is there a way to force a theme to let me change the window color
2008-01-04T01:12:00.000Z	unagi		can someone explain symbolic links to me?
2008-01-04T01:13:00.000Z	th0r	unagi	just a little more sophisticated than a shortcut in windows.
2008-01-04T01:14:00.000Z	th0r	unagi	not sure....but try right click on the desktop icon, choose properties, and then click on the icon in the window
2008-01-06T21:46:00.000Z	th0r	unagi	turn right at third and go two blocks north
2008-01-08T02:09:00.000Z	th0r	unagi	that should be handled by hald. Start here....unplug the drive, open a terminal and type 'tail -f /var/log/messages', plug in the drive, and pastebin the output that it generates in the terminal
2008-01-08T02:13:00.000Z	unagi	th0r	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/51130/
2008-01-08T02:14:00.000Z	th0r	unagi	what is the format of the drive....ntfs, vfat, ext3?
2008-01-08T02:15:00.000Z	th0r	unagi	type 'mount' in the terminal and look for a line that contains 'sdb1'
2008-01-08T02:16:00.000Z	th0r	unagi	if you don't find one try these two commands....'sudo mkdir /media/tmpntfs' then 'sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /media/tmpntfs'. That should mount your drive to the folder /media/tmpntfs
2008-01-08T02:17:00.000Z	th0r	unagi	 oops...the second command should be 'mount -t ntfs /dev/sdb1 /media/tmpntfs' sorry
2008-01-08T02:17:00.000Z	unagi	th0r	i can manually mount the device, that is not a problem. i should not have to manually mount it, im trying to get ubuntu to automatically mount it like it use to and put an icon in computer and on the desktop
2008-01-08T02:18:00.000Z	th0r	unagi	didn't know that. OK...all you need to do is add a line to /etc/fstab. Do you have an ntfs partition on the internal hard drive?
2008-01-08T02:20:00.000Z	th0r	unagi	mounting a usb drive should be handled by hald. to a 'ps ax | grep hald' and see if the process is running
2008-01-08T02:23:00.000Z	th0r	unagi	looks like hald is running. I don't know....never looked into how hald works. Would have to do some research. I would look for the file that hald uses to determine mount options and the like...that would be my first step.
2008-01-08T08:08:00.000Z	th0r	unagi	always carry a mousepad (and a small bottle)
2008-01-14T00:26:00.000Z	th0r	unagi	you might look at avidemux...I just installed it and haven't had a chance to check it out, but I think it will do frame by frame
2008-01-18T09:16:00.000Z	th0r	unagi	no
