2012-09-17T10:51:00.000Z	tortib		https://help.ubuntu.com/11.10/serverguide/openvpn.html
2012-09-17T10:51:00.000Z	tortib		i'm following that and running into problems
2012-09-17T10:51:00.000Z	tortib		I get an error unroutable control packet received from (my ip address)
2012-09-17T10:51:00.000Z	rob_p_	tortib	Bridged or routed?
2012-09-17T10:51:00.000Z	tortib		bridged
2012-09-17T10:52:00.000Z	tortib	rob_p_	bridged
2012-09-17T10:52:00.000Z	rob_p_	tortib	So your bridging scripts probably needs some work...
2012-09-17T10:52:00.000Z	tortib		it's pretty simple
2012-09-17T10:52:00.000Z	tortib		let me paste it for you

2012-09-17T10:54:00.000Z	tortib	rob_p_	the /etc/openvpn/server.conf looks like this

2012-09-17T10:54:00.000Z	rob_p_		Oops... gotta run. I'm actually at work!  If I get some time, I'll be back later.  But I have some bridging script examples that I use successfully on my servers.
2012-09-17T10:55:00.000Z	tortib	rob_p_	ugh

2012-09-17T10:56:00.000Z	tortib		anyone else know how to use openvpn with bridging?
