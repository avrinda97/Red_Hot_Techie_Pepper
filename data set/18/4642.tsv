2009-07-28T03:19:00.000Z	FirstSgt	felix_	dmesg, error_log, check your php.ini file (usually /etc/php.ini) for error log location

2009-07-28T03:24:00.000Z	FirstSgt	felix_	your php.ini file is trying to load an extension with a bad path.
2009-07-28T03:25:00.000Z	FirstSgt	felix_	you do not need xdebug.so for php
2009-07-28T03:25:00.000Z	FirstSgt	felix_	so remove that line
2009-07-28T03:29:00.000Z	felix_	FirstSgt	xdebug was working fine
2009-07-28T03:32:00.000Z	felix_	FirstSgt	I use that with netbeans. is that the cause of php stopped work? I didnt change anything on the config files this week
2009-07-28T03:40:00.000Z	FirstSgt	felix_	no, there isn't a way an ide can prevent your server from working.
2009-07-28T03:41:00.000Z	FirstSgt	felix_	you may have had code that would have changed the .ini file.  e.g. ini_set('property','value'); within the code (but ini_set() is temporary.
2009-07-28T03:42:00.000Z	felix_	FirstSgt	i mean, xdebug is crashing php? I just say cuz I didnt install xdebug today.
2009-07-28T03:42:00.000Z	felix_	FirstSgt	and no ini_set()..
2009-07-28T03:43:00.000Z	felix_	FirstSgt	just stopped to work between a render and other.
2009-07-28T03:44:00.000Z	felix_	FirstSgt	there any chance to crashed for overload? I was working with very big arrays.
2009-07-28T03:49:00.000Z	felix_	FirstSgt	xdebug lines removed from php.ini and php still dont works.
