2008-05-11T19:08:00.000Z	gfxstyler		my firefox always crashes when displaying flash content. do you know a fix?
2008-05-11T19:08:00.000Z	gfxstyler		it's pretty annoying
2008-05-11T19:08:00.000Z	ak5	gfxstyler	what distro?
2008-05-11T19:08:00.000Z	gfxstyler	ak5	ubuntu hardy heron
2008-05-11T19:08:00.000Z	ak5	gfxstyler	did you try installing firefox 2?
2008-05-11T19:09:00.000Z	gfxstyler	ak5	it's not crashing all the time, sometimes flash stuff (like youtube) works, sometimes it doesn't
2008-05-11T19:09:00.000Z	gfxstyler	ak5	no, i'd prefer to use the firefox that shipped with ubuntu
2008-05-11T19:09:00.000Z	ak5	gfxstyler	hmm, haven't had any problems with it
2008-05-11T19:09:00.000Z	gfxstyler	ak5	because it has some improvements like native gtk buttons and speed
2008-05-11T19:10:00.000Z	ak5	gfxstyler	ubuntu ships with a beta version - which sucks in my opinion - try to use the stable - tested ff2
2008-05-11T19:10:00.000Z	ak5	gfxstyler	hmm you are right - but it is still a beta
2008-05-11T19:10:00.000Z	gfxstyler	ak5	you're right
2008-05-11T19:11:00.000Z	gfxstyler	ak5	okay i guess i'll have to use firefox 2 until firefox 3 is final
2008-05-11T19:11:00.000Z	ak5	gfxstyler	they just crammed it in cause 8.04 is LTS and they didn't want to support ff2 for that long
2008-05-11T19:12:00.000Z	ak5	gfxstyler	plus if you use firefox plugins you may be disappointed
2008-05-11T19:12:00.000Z	gfxstyler	ak5	do you know when firefox3 will be final? i heard that ubuntu will provide firefox updates later
2008-05-11T19:12:00.000Z	ak5	gfxstyler	sry not my area of expertise
