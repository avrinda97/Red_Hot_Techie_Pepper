2012-05-22T14:41:00.000Z	Talisman`Work		is there any way to easily rollback an upgrade? i.e. I want to go back to 11.10 - I'm finding that 12.04 is broken for a number of my packages.
2012-05-22T14:41:00.000Z	Abhijit	Talisman`Work	no. you must reinstall 11.10
2012-05-22T14:42:00.000Z	Abhijit	Talisman`Work	in future you can use the concept of backup. you can take full system backup. using cp -R or something like that and then you will be able to restore backup points.
2012-05-22T14:42:00.000Z	Abhijit	Talisman`Work	which partitions you have?
2012-05-22T14:42:00.000Z	Talisman`Work	Abhijit	lol... I don't do backups
2012-05-22T14:43:00.000Z	Abhijit	Talisman`Work	dont lol. i have burned my hands on this joke that i dont take backups. take it seriously. backups are serious!
2012-05-22T14:43:00.000Z	Talisman`Work	Abhijit	I have an ext4 partition.
2012-05-22T14:43:00.000Z	Abhijit	Talisman`Work	no. 'which' partitions you have? not the 'what' partition type you have
2012-05-22T14:44:00.000Z	Talisman`Work	Abhijit	I don't backup anything except my critical data/files... too much to backup if doing the whole OS everytime
2012-05-22T14:44:00.000Z	Abhijit	Talisman`Work	the whole os is much much less than our regular music and video files
2012-05-22T14:44:00.000Z	Talisman`Work	Abhijit	I don't even bother with /boot... I just do what's in /home and whatever db directories required - the rest I rebuild.
2012-05-22T14:45:00.000Z	Talisman`Work	Abhijit	I don't have music/videos on my systems
2012-05-22T14:45:00.000Z	Abhijit	Talisman`Work	11.10 wont do anything to your /home but / and /boot will b e modified
2012-05-22T14:47:00.000Z	Talisman`Work	Abhijit	it's already partitioned.
2012-05-22T14:47:00.000Z	Abhijit	Talisman`Work	i mean format while installing the new os
2012-05-22T14:48:00.000Z	Talisman`Work	Abhijit	ideally I don't want to initialise the partitions at all.
2012-05-22T14:51:00.000Z	Abhijit	Talisman`Work	welcome
