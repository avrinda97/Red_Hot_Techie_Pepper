2008-12-09T03:01:00.000Z	nimbus		anyone use an ati radeon 4650 have any tips to reduce the flickering issue?
2008-12-09T03:03:00.000Z	nimbus		Shadowwulf, do you use ati?
2008-12-09T03:03:00.000Z	shadowwulf	nimbus	nvidia
2008-12-09T03:04:00.000Z	nimbus		try disabling compiz before playing a game.
2008-12-09T03:04:00.000Z	nimbus		See if that helps.
2008-12-09T03:04:00.000Z	shadowwulf	nimbus	how would i do that ?
2008-12-09T03:05:00.000Z	nimbus		Get "compiz fusion icon" from add programs menu
2008-12-09T03:05:00.000Z	nimbus		that is the easiest way
2008-12-09T03:05:00.000Z	nimbus		then start it. it is under your applications> system tool
2008-12-09T03:06:00.000Z	shadowwulf	nimbus	same error ...out of range or input not supported
2008-12-09T03:07:00.000Z	nimbus	shadowwulf	did you turn off compiz and switch to metacity?
2008-12-09T03:07:00.000Z	shadowwulf	nimbus	i did
2008-12-09T03:07:00.000Z	nimbus		not sure then
2008-12-09T03:08:00.000Z	shadowwulf	nimbus	is there a way to make the game go to a windowed mode ?
2008-12-09T03:08:00.000Z	nimbus		so these problems only occur in windowed mode?
2008-12-09T03:09:00.000Z	shadowwulf	nimbus	the problem happens in full screen mode ,... if the game starts windowed ... everything is fine
2008-12-09T03:10:00.000Z	nimbus	shadowwulf	sounds like an issue with the refresh rate.
2008-12-09T03:11:00.000Z	shadowwulf	nimbus	 know of a way to fix it ? or a hotkey to make a game go windowed mode ?
