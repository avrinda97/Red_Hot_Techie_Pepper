2009-05-24T23:35:00.000Z	chuckc		where do i enable ssh port forwarding?  looking at /etc/ssh/sshd_config  /etc/ssh/ssh_config  set all the seemingly relevant options to yes, but still get debug1: Remote: Server has disabled port forwarding.

2009-05-24T23:42:00.000Z	th0r	chuckc	near the bottom....X11Forwarding yes
2009-05-24T23:43:00.000Z	chuckc	th0r	I have X11Forwarding yes
2009-05-24T23:43:00.000Z	th0r	chuckc	yeah...I believe it is now enabled by default
2009-05-24T23:43:00.000Z	th0r	chuckc	if you check that pastebin I sent...it has fairly complete notes on setting up x forwarding
2009-05-24T23:45:00.000Z	th0r	chuckc	that is done either in your router or in iptables
2009-05-24T23:45:00.000Z	th0r	chuckc	that is port forwarding, not X forwarding
2009-05-24T23:46:00.000Z	chuckc	th0r	ok, ssh tunnel
2009-05-24T23:46:00.000Z	th0r	chuckc	ok...ssh tunnel...that is done on the command line.
2009-05-24T23:47:00.000Z	th0r	chuckc	there are notes in the pastebin about setting that up also
2009-05-24T23:47:00.000Z	chuckc	th0r	 i know the command, i just can seem to enable forwarding on my server.
2009-05-24T23:47:00.000Z	th0r	chuckc	you don't need forwarding on the server....your ssh tunnel is on port 22 unless you changed it
2009-05-24T23:47:00.000Z	chuckc	th0r	Remote: Server has disabled port forwarding.
2009-05-24T23:49:00.000Z	th0r	chuckc	what command are you using to open the ssh to the other computer?
2009-05-24T23:49:00.000Z	chuckc	th0r	 this is my string ssh -v -R 80:localhost:8080 chuck@remo.local  which gives debug1: Remote: Server has disabled port forwarding. debug1: remote forward failure for: listen 80, connect localhost:8080 Warning: remote port forwarding failed for listen port 80
2009-05-24T23:50:00.000Z	th0r	chuckc	nope....the command is wrong. Look at the bottom of the pastebin I sent
2009-05-24T23:51:00.000Z	th0r	chuckc	do you have a firewall on the server?
