2008-08-29T06:00:00.000Z	dunn357		yeah, light on router wouldnt come on

2008-08-29T06:00:00.000Z	dunn357		ok, so i installed vista and wiped the HD of ubuntu
2008-08-29T06:00:00.000Z	dunn357		and internet worked just fine
2008-08-29T06:00:00.000Z	dunn357		then, i put in ubuntu and ran it as LiveCD, internet is working just fine!
2008-08-29T06:00:00.000Z	dunn357		have yet to reinstall tho
2008-08-29T06:01:00.000Z	dunn357		got no idea why it wouldnt work yesterday tho
2008-08-29T06:03:00.000Z	cyphase	dunn357	if you want, you can install ubuntu from inside windows
2008-08-29T06:03:00.000Z	dunn357	cyphase	is that a recommended approach?
2008-08-29T06:03:00.000Z	cyphase	dunn357	yes, it's on the official CD
2008-08-29T06:03:00.000Z	cyphase	dunn357	well..
2008-08-29T06:04:00.000Z	dunn357		nutricyle, ah i see!
2008-08-29T06:04:00.000Z	cyphase	dunn357	i don't know if it's "recommended". it works, and it's supported officially. it may be a *little* slower
2008-08-29T06:05:00.000Z	cyphase	dunn357	i've only tried on one computer (not mine), which only has 221MB of memory
2008-08-29T06:05:00.000Z	dunn357	cyphase	ok i see, but im so full of optimism now (and ive decided to scrap my old windows box so the soon to be ubuntu box will get some new parts)
