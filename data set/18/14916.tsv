2005-07-23T11:48:00.000Z	Madpilot	Gatton	thnx...
2005-07-23T11:48:00.000Z	Gatton	Madpilot	np. Finally an easy question I can answer ;)
2005-07-23T11:48:00.000Z	Madpilot	Gatton	start small and work up! ;)
2005-08-11T12:14:00.000Z	Madpilot	Gatton	just discovered that. make it "sudo find / -name <foo>"...
2005-08-11T12:14:00.000Z	Gatton	Madpilot	yep that's what i do
2005-08-11T12:17:00.000Z	Madpilot	Gatton	I already do. 2nd thing I start, right after my browser...
2005-08-12T12:16:00.000Z	Gatton	Madpilot	why not have him paste his sources.list somewhere so we can look at it?
2005-08-12T12:17:00.000Z	Madpilot	Gatton	was trying to do the CLI-free way, but evidently that isn't working! ;) want to walk guardianx3 thru that, please?
2005-08-12T12:18:00.000Z	Gatton	Madpilot	well I agree CLI is a good last resort. I assume he added repositories through Synaptic? If so just wondered if something got screwed up in the formatting or something. Although it shouldn't
2005-08-12T12:19:00.000Z	Madpilot	Gatton	apparently he followed the wiki repos page, which is entirely based on Synaptic, so I'm not sure what's going wrong.
2005-08-12T12:20:00.000Z	Gatton	Madpilot	oh ok. Yea because I get 23 packages when I search on vlc
2005-08-12T12:23:00.000Z	Madpilot	Gatton	same here, and I just had a look at the wiki page, and it works
2005-08-12T12:33:00.000Z	Madpilot	Gatton	whee, another repos question... ;)
2005-08-12T12:33:00.000Z	Gatton	Madpilot	that does seem to be the trend this evening :)
2005-08-12T12:33:00.000Z	Madpilot	Gatton	it's in one of the regular Ubuntu repos - just a sec
2005-08-12T12:37:00.000Z	Madpilot	Gatton	ah, wireless! if the gods had intended for linux users to use wireless, they wouldn't have invented Cat5 cable! ;)
2005-08-12T12:38:00.000Z	Gatton	Madpilot	agreed. I am staying wired for the forseeable future
