2011-11-15T15:35:00.000Z	CharminTheMoose		What are the benefits of using a specific driver for an integrated graphics card (let's say i915) over just using xvesa? Not as if you'd need hardware acceleration with that kinda card
2011-11-15T15:35:00.000Z	ikonia	CharminTheMoose	one is generic, one is chipset specific
2011-11-15T15:35:00.000Z	ikonia	CharminTheMoose	performance,stability etc
2011-11-20T23:41:00.000Z	ikonia	CharminTheMoose	it's just a meta package
2011-11-20T23:41:00.000Z	ikonia	CharminTheMoose	why do you want to remove it all ?
2011-11-20T23:42:00.000Z	CharminTheMoose	ikonia	I'm running a laptop, so I don't need printing facilities on it.
2011-11-20T23:42:00.000Z	ikonia	CharminTheMoose	so just disable it
2011-11-20T23:42:00.000Z	ikonia	CharminTheMoose	removing it is overkill
2011-11-20T23:43:00.000Z	CharminTheMoose	ikonia	I don't really want unused packages taking up diskspace either.
2011-11-20T23:44:00.000Z	ikonia	CharminTheMoose	it doesn't take up much, but other applications want the cups system to be there, so keep it simple and just disable it
2011-11-20T23:45:00.000Z	CharminTheMoose	ikonia	fair point I guess. How would I go about disabling the daemon?
2011-11-22T04:58:00.000Z	ikonia	CharminTheMoose	it's not a good idea
2011-11-22T05:00:00.000Z	CharminTheMoose	ikonia	I perhaps misworded that.. rather doing 'cat [files] > /dev/null' writes the info to the buffers in memory.. Just seems strange to me that the hdd can fall asleep and you can access the file without it waking up again.. Like as if it checks the RAM first, then the hdd
2011-11-22T05:01:00.000Z	CharminTheMoose	ikonia	it'll never fall asleep/spin down?
2011-11-22T05:04:00.000Z	CharminTheMoose	ikonia	so the harddisk is basically never idle? What process would be writing/reading from disk.. if we discard X for a sec.
2011-11-22T05:05:00.000Z	ikonia	CharminTheMoose	syslog, kswapd, many processes
2012-03-31T22:57:00.000Z	ikonia	CharminTheMoose	what is "slim"
2012-03-31T22:58:00.000Z	CharminTheMoose	ikonia	Simple Login Manager.
