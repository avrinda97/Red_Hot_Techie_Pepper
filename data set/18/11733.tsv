2006-06-18T08:54:00.000Z	discofro		I'm feeling a bit ignored...
2006-06-18T08:54:00.000Z	discofro		:(
2006-06-18T08:55:00.000Z	discofro		I'll give that a shot
2006-06-18T08:55:00.000Z	discofro		thanks
2006-06-18T08:57:00.000Z	discofro		The people in #minix are saying that minix is a completely different OS than ubuntu
2006-06-18T08:58:00.000Z	discofro		I have no idea
2006-06-18T08:58:00.000Z	discofro		What's happening is, when I boot my system on Ubuntu 5.10, it says "FATAL: Module minix not found"
2006-06-18T08:58:00.000Z	discofro		I can't find any reference to this error on the wiki
2006-06-18T08:58:00.000Z	discofro		there is one workaround in the forums
2006-06-18T08:58:00.000Z	discofro		but it's making more errors...
2006-06-18T08:59:00.000Z	jighead	discofro	does your machine boot past the error? or does it hang there?
2006-06-18T09:00:00.000Z	discofro	jighead	it hangs and it gives me a prompt to enter command-line
2006-06-18T09:00:00.000Z	jighead	discofro	do you have minix in /etc/modules?
2006-06-18T09:01:00.000Z	discofro	jighead	I get an error that says "Cannot read /etc/fstabs" when I try to mount the main drive
2006-06-18T09:01:00.000Z	discofro		Does that mean my hard drive is dead?
2006-06-18T09:03:00.000Z	jighead	discofro	root should be mounted when you hit enter to get the command-line
2006-06-18T09:04:00.000Z	discofro		does the error "mount: Mounting /dev/hda1 on /root failed: No such Device" mean my hard drive is fragged?
2006-06-18T09:04:00.000Z	discofro	jighead	when I just type 'mount' I get '/proc/mounts: No such file or directory"
