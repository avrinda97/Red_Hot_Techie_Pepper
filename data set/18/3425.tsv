2009-10-06T21:55:00.000Z	Guest5811		on NVidia x server after savin configuration it write me down Unable to remove old X config backup file '/etc/X11/xorg.conf.backup'.  Is there any tip how should i fix it and don't have to set configuration every boot?
2009-10-06T21:57:00.000Z	SwampThing	Guest5811	are you using sudo?
2009-10-06T21:57:00.000Z	Guest5811	SwampThing	yes
2009-10-06T21:58:00.000Z	SwampThing	Guest5811	it doesn't make sense to me that /etc/X11/xorg.conf.backup would cause a problem
2009-10-06T21:58:00.000Z	Guest5811	SwampThing	for me doesn't make sense at all.
2009-10-06T22:01:00.000Z	Guest5811	SwampThing	so any suggestion?
2009-10-06T22:01:00.000Z	SwampThing	Guest5811	I shouldn't make any recommendations without more information
2009-10-06T22:05:00.000Z	SwampThing	Guest5811	what is the problem?
2009-10-06T22:08:00.000Z	SwampThing	Guest5811	meaning Xorg is unable to read /etc/X11/xorg.conf?
2009-10-06T22:14:00.000Z	SwampThing	Guest5811	what are you doing to save your /etc/X11/xorg.conf?
2009-10-06T22:16:00.000Z	SwampThing	Guest5811	I don't have Nvidia X server.
2009-10-06T22:17:00.000Z	Guest5811	SwampThing	so no help?
2009-10-06T22:18:00.000Z	SwampThing	Guest5811	can't help without the hardware and the software to test.  You can try modifying your xorg.conf file manually, that's all I can recommend, but specifics you would have to research on your own
2009-10-06T22:25:00.000Z	SwampThing	Guest5811	the other option is to get paid support
2009-10-06T22:26:00.000Z	Guest5811	SwampThing	that solution is not for me...
2009-10-06T22:26:00.000Z	SwampThing	Guest5811	me neither
2009-10-06T22:28:00.000Z	SwampThing	Guest5811	I hope you find the answer
2009-10-06T22:28:00.000Z	Guest5811	SwampThing	thx mate
