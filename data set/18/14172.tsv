2005-12-02T08:44:00.000Z	twothirtyseven		Can anyone tell me why ubuntu hoary wont read my sound card?
2005-12-02T08:44:00.000Z	zdennis	twothirtyseven	it doesn't recognize your sound card or you are using the wrong output (such as ALSA when you should be using OSS)?
2005-12-02T08:47:00.000Z	zdennis	twothirtyseven	what program are you using?
2005-12-02T08:48:00.000Z	zdennis	twothirtyseven	do you have a music CD or mp3 handy?
2005-12-02T08:49:00.000Z	zdennis	twothirtyseven	ok, open up XMMS (Applications > Sound & Video > XMMS)
2005-12-02T08:50:00.000Z	zdennis	twothirtyseven	click n the upper left-hand corner of XMMS, it will give you a menu, open your CD or mp3
2005-12-02T08:50:00.000Z	zdennis	twothirtyseven	and play a song...then go back to the menu, and go to Preferences
2005-12-02T08:50:00.000Z	zdennis	twothirtyseven	preferences is in the Options menu
2005-12-02T08:51:00.000Z	zdennis	twothirtyseven	ah, that's not good
2005-12-02T08:51:00.000Z	zdennis	twothirtyseven	go straight to Options > Preferences menu
2005-12-02T08:52:00.000Z	zdennis	twothirtyseven	on the first tab, there is "Output Plugin" listed underneath "Input Plugins"
2005-12-02T08:52:00.000Z	zdennis	twothirtyseven	what is it set to?
2005-12-02T08:53:00.000Z	zdennis	twothirtyseven	basically, try to set the Output to the different options available and try to play your music. Hopefully one of them will give you soun.d
2005-12-02T08:55:00.000Z	zdennis	twothirtyseven	well you have speakers plugged in and turned on, and volume turned up while you were trying each of the different output plugins?
2005-12-02T08:58:00.000Z	zdennis	twothirtyseven	I am guessing you never heard any sound then
2005-12-02T08:58:00.000Z	zdennis	twothirtyseven	I am out of ideas, I haven't ever had to configure a sound card that wasn't properly recognized.
2005-12-02T08:59:00.000Z	zdennis	twothirtyseven	you may want to ask in channel #debian
2005-12-02T08:59:00.000Z	zdennis	twothirtyseven	they're are usually some pretty hardcore folks in there who may be able to help you out
