2004-12-17T14:17:00.000Z	mdke	wood1	no don't worry people don't write viruses for linux yet
2004-12-17T14:19:00.000Z	mdke	wood1	try using linux on all your computers
2004-12-17T14:24:00.000Z	mdke	wood1	you don't need a virus checker
2004-12-17T14:27:00.000Z	mdke	wood1	don't tell people that
2004-12-17T14:28:00.000Z	mdke	wood1	i doubt it
2004-12-17T14:29:00.000Z	mdke	wood1	well the ubuntu developers have decided that it is a good idea
2004-12-17T14:30:00.000Z	mdke	wood1	and they know what they're talking about :)
2004-12-17T14:30:00.000Z	mdke	wood1	you don't have to
2004-12-17T14:30:00.000Z	mdke	wood1	it saves your password for a limited time. and if you want a shell with root permissions, you can type sudo -s
2004-12-17T14:31:00.000Z	mdke	wood1	then you are weird
2004-12-17T14:31:00.000Z	mdke	wood1	same thing applies where you forget the root password
2004-12-17T14:36:00.000Z	mdke	wood1	you can search for packages like this "apt-cache search clam"
2004-12-17T15:10:00.000Z	mdke	wood1	i know what you need for christmas.
