2010-03-09T07:11:00.000Z	Shazam		how do I get the password to an account on my system. I have root access
2010-03-09T07:11:00.000Z	Gnea	Shazam	you can reset it
2010-03-09T07:12:00.000Z	Shazam	Gnea	if services automatically run under that account, will I have to make any serious changes to get it going?
2010-03-09T07:12:00.000Z	Gnea	Shazam	what sort of services?
2010-03-09T07:13:00.000Z	Shazam	Gnea	that was vague. mysql runs under mysql user account. can't for the life of me remember the password to login as mysql.
2010-03-09T07:13:00.000Z	Gnea	Shazam	oh! nah, it shouldn't matter.
2010-03-09T07:14:00.000Z	Gnea	Shazam	just: passwd mysql   and change it to something else. it's different than the login password to within mysql anyway, so it shouldn't hurt a thing
2010-03-09T07:19:00.000Z	Shazam		when I su into another account, it appears to succeed, but my prompt stays the same, and whoami shows my original user. What could be the problem?
2010-03-09T07:19:00.000Z	Gnea	Shazam	how are you using su? just: su user?
2010-03-09T07:20:00.000Z	Shazam	Gnea	yes. it prompts for password, I provide.
2010-03-09T07:20:00.000Z	Gnea	Shazam	also, remember that a user whos shell is set to /bin/false cannot attain a shell.
2010-03-09T07:20:00.000Z	Gnea		finger user  <-- shows you the shell
2010-03-09T07:21:00.000Z	Shazam	Gnea	ah. yep. that's it.
2010-03-09T07:21:00.000Z	Gnea	Shazam	which is a good thing :) you can, of coure, change it for the time being to get stuff done.
2010-03-09T07:21:00.000Z	Gnea		*course
2010-03-09T07:23:00.000Z	Shazam	Gnea	and does it make sense to you that it also isn't listed under system > administration > users and groups?
2010-03-09T07:24:00.000Z	Gnea	Shazam	in a case such as this, no. this is what the commandline is useful for.
2010-03-09T07:24:00.000Z	Gnea	Shazam	that is, it doesn't surprise me
