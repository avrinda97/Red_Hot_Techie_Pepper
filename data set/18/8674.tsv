2007-07-22T13:55:00.000Z	C-{pR0F	Scunizi	DVD write + DVD software
2007-07-22T13:55:00.000Z	Scunizi	C-{pR0F	is DVD write in the repo's? also DVD software? is that the title?
2007-07-22T13:57:00.000Z	C-{pR0F	Scunizi	to make it useable on a DVD player , u need to know what's  the format  that dvd player does play , and then convert your movie into that format , then write it to a DVD-rom
2007-07-22T13:59:00.000Z	Scunizi	C-{pR0F	other than Pal, ntsc etc aren't most dvd files stored as vob files.  I'm just looking for software to create a universal movie (ntsc) DVD from .. say a mpeg4 video file.
2007-07-22T14:00:00.000Z	C-{pR0F	Scunizi	what are u using linux , widows ?
2007-07-22T14:00:00.000Z	Scunizi	C-{pR0F	I've got Dapper, Feisty (gnome & kde) and windows xp.. prefer linux
2007-07-22T14:01:00.000Z	Scunizi	C-{pR0F	LiVes will allow me to create a video file of different clips and pic then write it out to a mpg4 file.
2007-07-22T14:02:00.000Z	C-{pR0F	Scunizi	I used to use a software called "Xilisoft video converter" on windows , but let me see what' available for linux
2007-07-22T14:03:00.000Z	Scunizi	C-{pR0F	thanks.
2007-07-22T14:06:00.000Z	C-{pR0F	Scunizi	well , i can't find one for linux , maybe someone else could help , or u can use one under windows or u can use wine if u don't like windows !
2007-07-22T14:07:00.000Z	Scunizi	C-{pR0F	thanks for looking.  I may have to go to winxp to do this. I was hoping to avoid that. Wine is problematic and cumbersome. With all the linux rippers out there you'd think someone would actually like to create a DVD! :)
2007-07-22T14:11:00.000Z	Scunizi	C-{pR0F	looks like there is a program called DVD Author I just found.. http://rpmfind.net/linux/rpm2html/search.php?query=dvdauthor
2007-07-22T14:11:00.000Z	C-{pR0F	Scunizi	well done
2007-07-22T14:12:00.000Z	Scunizi	C-{pR0F	probably shoulda googled first but I was feeling lazy. :)
2007-07-22T14:13:00.000Z	C-{pR0F	Scunizi	"Ask google before asking anybody"
2007-07-22T14:14:00.000Z	Scunizi	C-{pR0F	yea.. but sometimes you just want to "talk"
2007-07-22T14:16:00.000Z	C-{pR0F	Scunizi	yea , sometimes , u can save time  ,by asking someone with experiance
