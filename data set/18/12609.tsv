2007-09-27T08:09:00.000Z	blubb		anyone knows how I could increase that timeout of wpa_supplicant: Authentication with 00:18:39:ab:30:96 timed out. ?
2007-09-27T08:10:00.000Z	POVaddct	blubb	are sure wpa_supplicant is using the right driver? (option -D ...)
2007-09-27T08:16:00.000Z	blubb	POVaddct	why are you guys never answering the questions? Yes I'm using the correct driver
2007-09-27T08:17:00.000Z	POVaddct	blubb	because the timeout could be caused by wpa_supplicant using the wrong driver method (i.e. wext instead of madwifi when talking to a madwifi-based card)
2007-09-27T08:18:00.000Z	POVaddct	blubb	i looked into the manpage of wpa_supplicant.conf and there is no timeout value..
2007-09-27T08:19:00.000Z	POVaddct	blubb	also there seems to be no commandline option for it
2007-09-27T08:19:00.000Z	blubb	POVaddct	I know I couldn't find it either
2007-09-27T08:20:00.000Z	POVaddct	blubb	which wireless card/driver do you use anyway?
2007-09-27T08:20:00.000Z	POVaddct	blubb	argh
2007-09-27T08:20:00.000Z	POVaddct	blubb	no native driver available?
2007-09-27T08:24:00.000Z	blubb	POVaddct	none thats usable
2007-09-27T08:25:00.000Z	POVaddct	blubb	which card/chipset is it?
2007-09-27T08:27:00.000Z	POVaddct	blubb	so the bcm43xx driver is still not usable? too bad
2007-09-27T08:27:00.000Z	POVaddct	blubb	i avoid broadcom cards, so i have little experience with bcm43xx
2007-09-27T08:29:00.000Z	blubb	POVaddct	at least not that one shipped with ubuntu
2007-09-27T08:29:00.000Z	blubb	POVaddct	you know the ndiswrapper works perfect except the authentification...
2007-09-27T08:31:00.000Z	POVaddct	blubb	if you cannot answer me in the query, please join #POVhelp
2007-09-27T08:31:00.000Z	blubb	POVaddct	no I don't want to (can't send private...
