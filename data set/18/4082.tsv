2009-11-01T07:43:00.000Z	randomusr		 typed it correctly
2009-11-01T07:44:00.000Z	edbian	randomusr	Which will update the package list for apt
2009-11-01T07:47:00.000Z	randomusr	edbian	done. it says it's already the newest version. Where the hell is it?
2009-11-01T07:48:00.000Z	edbian	randomusr	What's the package?
2009-11-01T07:48:00.000Z	randomusr		linux-source-2.6.28
2009-11-01T07:48:00.000Z	edbian	randomusr	Not every package shows up in the menus.  Linux-source?  Are you trying to get source code?
2009-11-01T07:49:00.000Z	randomusr	edbian	you are correct sir
2009-11-01T07:50:00.000Z	edbian	randomusr	"apt-get source <packageName>" returns source files.  You have to put the terminal in a place you want the files to drop though.  For example first "cd /home/<user>/Desktop"  then "apt-get source <packageName"
2009-11-01T07:50:00.000Z	edbian	randomusr	You shouldn't be root to download source files because then you can only edit them as root.
2009-11-01T07:52:00.000Z	randomusr	edbian	that's lame but it seems to be working now.... who's idea was that?
2009-11-01T07:52:00.000Z	randomusr		developers, developers, developers
2009-11-01T07:52:00.000Z	edbian	randomusr	I don't know.  However invented the apt-get program.
2009-11-01T07:52:00.000Z	edbian	randomusr	What's lame about it?
2009-11-01T07:52:00.000Z	edbian	randomusr	*whoever
2009-11-01T07:53:00.000Z	randomusr	edbian	personal preference, i think it should be auto correcting and search source packages proper, but oh well. I'm not a programmer
2009-11-01T07:54:00.000Z	edbian	randomusr	I don't understand what you mean.  What isn't automatic?  You can use "apt-get search <packageName>"  to search for packages and "apt-get show <packageName>" to see descriptions
2009-11-01T07:54:00.000Z	randomusr	edbian	using sudo apt-get sources PackageName failed on dpkg-dev or some junk
2009-11-01T07:54:00.000Z	edbian	randomusr	"apt-get source <packageName"    source not sources ;)
