2008-01-04T22:25:00.000Z	pmratpoison	Clearzen	I have the opposite problem :)
2008-01-04T22:26:00.000Z	pmratpoison	Clearzen	Windows is missing on GRUB
2008-01-04T22:26:00.000Z	Clearzen	pmratpoison	When did it disappear? did it ever appear?
2008-01-04T22:27:00.000Z	pmratpoison	Clearzen	It dissappeared whn I tried to tweak my usplash theme
2008-01-04T22:28:00.000Z	Clearzen	pmratpoison	you have to reenter it in /boot/grub/menu.lst to find where on the disk windows is open /boot/grub/device.map and look there
2008-01-04T22:28:00.000Z	Clearzen	pmratpoison	Does that make sense to you?
2008-01-04T22:31:00.000Z	pmratpoison	Clearzen	Not sure if I can do it successfully though :)
2008-01-04T22:31:00.000Z	pmratpoison	Clearzen	Not sure if I can do it successfully though :) Is that correct?
2008-01-04T22:38:00.000Z	pmratpoison	Clearzen	would this http://pastebin.com/m470caaa be correct? (without the comment lines, that is)
2008-01-04T22:39:00.000Z	Clearzen	pmratpoison	if (hd0,0) is where your grub assigned it then that should work
2008-01-04T22:42:00.000Z	pmratpoison	Clearzen	I think that's where it's at... my device.map , maps (hd0) as /dev/sda and the windows partition is in /dev/sda1
2008-01-04T22:44:00.000Z	Clearzen	pmratpoison	If you run find /boot/stage1 from grub what does it give you?
2008-01-04T22:45:00.000Z	pmratpoison	Clearzen	what do you mean "from grub" ?
2008-01-04T22:47:00.000Z	Clearzen	pmratpoison	type sudo grub and it will take you into a different shell with different commands basically
2008-01-04T22:49:00.000Z	Clearzen	pmratpoison	find /boot/grub/stage1  <--that is the command
2008-01-04T22:49:00.000Z	Clearzen	pmratpoison	it looks like (hd0,0) is most likely correct though
2008-01-04T22:51:00.000Z	pmratpoison	Clearzen	said command output (hd0,6)
