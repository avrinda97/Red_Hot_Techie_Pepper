2006-05-27T11:46:00.000Z	Mortal`		Hey. When starting Audacity, I get this error: "Error initializing the audio i/o layer. \n You will not be able to play or record audio. \n Error: Host error." Does anyone know what I can do to fix this? My microphone doesn't work on Skype either, but I'm not sure if those two things are related. I haven't yet been able to use my Mike In on my soundcard yet.
2006-05-27T11:47:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Mortal`	try " killall esd "
2006-05-27T11:47:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Mortal`	then run audacity again
2006-05-27T11:47:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Mortal`	audacity doesn't play nice with rsd
2006-05-27T11:48:00.000Z	Mortal`	thoreauputic	I don't get output from killall, and Audacity still won't work
2006-05-27T11:48:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Mortal`	you wouldn't get output from killall esd
2006-05-27T11:48:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Mortal`	is skype running? If so, get rid of it
2006-05-27T11:48:00.000Z	Mortal`	thoreauputic	will do.
2006-05-27T11:49:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Mortal`	I think something is hogging your sound device
2006-05-27T11:49:00.000Z	Mortal`	thoreauputic	it works now. But can't I run Audacity and Skype simultaneous?
2006-05-27T11:50:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Mortal`	correct
2006-05-27T11:50:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Mortal`	skype grans the sound device
2006-05-27T11:50:00.000Z	Mortal`	thoreauputic	ah, that's sad. Isn't there a workaround?
2006-05-27T11:51:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Mortal`	there's a sound grabber hack someone did to fool skype
2006-05-27T11:51:00.000Z	Mortal`	thoreauputic	I'll see if I can find a mixer
2006-05-27T11:51:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Mortal`	skype is closed source so we can't really do much about it
2006-05-27T11:52:00.000Z	Mortal`	thoreauputic	blue89 said I could search for a software audio mixer
2006-05-27T11:52:00.000Z	thoreauputic	Mortal`	might be something on the skype wiki page about it
