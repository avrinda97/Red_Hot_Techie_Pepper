2011-10-06T01:34:00.000Z	machine2		how long will it take me to set up a basic LAMP configuration for a website?
2011-10-06T01:35:00.000Z	jrib	machine2	the length of time it takes you to press space bar and enter at the task selection screen during install?
2011-10-06T01:35:00.000Z	machine2	jrib	is it that easy?
2011-10-06T01:36:00.000Z	jrib	machine2	yep.  If you want to do it after install you just run tasksel and again just select LAMP (see ubottu)
2011-10-06T01:36:00.000Z	machine2	jrib	i only have set up one server before and that was on slicehost.. it was debian
2011-10-06T01:37:00.000Z	machine2	jrib	should i use ubuntu for this, is it easier than debian?
2011-10-06T01:37:00.000Z	jrib	machine2	difficulty is equal
2011-10-06T01:39:00.000Z	machine2	jrib	if i use Wubi, on a vista machine, will i have the same experience as a clean install ?
2011-10-06T01:40:00.000Z	jrib	machine2	yes.  There may be a slight performance hit however.  Personally, I do not recommend wubi
2011-10-06T01:41:00.000Z	machine2	jrib	any reason why not wubi? i dont mind the performance hit, because it will be quite a hassle for me to completely format the machine
2011-10-06T01:42:00.000Z	jrib	machine2	read the warnings on wubi's website.  I just don't see the benefit of wubi. Creating a separate partition is not a difficult thing to do imo
2011-10-06T01:43:00.000Z	machine2	jrib	yeah but i guess the reason is trying not to mess with the master boot record
2011-10-06T01:44:00.000Z	jrib	machine2	ubuntu and kubuntu share the same repositories but have a different set of packages (one features the unity environment and the other features kde)
2011-10-06T01:44:00.000Z	jrib	machine2	meh
2011-10-06T01:45:00.000Z	machine2	jrib	so for someone who has just a tiny bit of ssh experience and mostly uses windows machines, should i use kubuntu?
2011-10-06T01:45:00.000Z	jrib	machine2	if you like kde, sure.  You can have multiple enironments.  It's trivial to setup (just install ubuntu-desktop after installing kubuntu and you will have additional session options at the login screen)
2011-10-06T01:48:00.000Z	jrib	machine2	I have to go, bye.  You should just install every desktop and window manager and try them all until you decide on one :)  You may even become an xmonad user ;)
