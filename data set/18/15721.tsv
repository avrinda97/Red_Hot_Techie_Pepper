2005-04-11T06:31:00.000Z	ColdPack		I did but there isn't one in the Ubuntu repositories it seems
2005-04-11T06:32:00.000Z	FR500	ColdPack	hoary?
2005-04-11T06:31:00.000Z	FR500	ColdPack	apt-get install mpg123
2005-04-11T06:31:00.000Z	FR500	ColdPack	type that in a console as fakeroot
2005-04-11T06:32:00.000Z	FR500	ColdPack	the repositories are disabled by default
2005-04-11T06:34:00.000Z	FR500	ColdPack	it's not a boot option the thing is that it screwed after i messed up with menu.lst
2005-04-11T06:35:00.000Z	FR500	ColdPack	does hibernatio work for u?
2005-04-11T06:37:00.000Z	FR500	ColdPack	the thing is that it's somehow a "media center" and 2 minutes bootup for a tv is beyond unaceptable
2005-04-11T06:38:00.000Z	FR500	ColdPack	yah but tv should be instantly on
