2008-07-19T17:41:00.000Z	Bogh	hypercity	do you have a seperate partition for your home folder?
2008-07-19T17:42:00.000Z	hypercity	Bogh	yes
2008-07-19T17:42:00.000Z	Bogh	hypercity	when installing with apt you install to your / partition, so it doesn't have an impact on your home folder, try deleteting things from /home, also have you emptied your trash bin?
2008-07-19T17:45:00.000Z	hypercity	Bogh	that is my actual problem, my trash is empty, i install to root and deleting files from my home doesnt make any diference , root and /dev/sda3 work fine tghough
2008-07-19T17:48:00.000Z	Bogh	hypercity	can you paste 'df -h' and 'mount' to http://pastebin.com/ please?
2008-07-19T17:51:00.000Z	hypercity	Bogh	http://pastebin.com/m780c42f6
2008-07-19T17:54:00.000Z	Bogh	hypercity	yeah, looks strange, are the files removed when you delete them?
2008-07-19T17:56:00.000Z	hypercity	Bogh	i cant see them anymore but the space isn't freed
2008-07-19T17:56:00.000Z	Bogh	hypercity	have you tried reboot to single usermode and unmounting the drive and run a fsck check?
2008-07-19T17:57:00.000Z	hypercity	Bogh	how do i do that?
2008-07-19T17:59:00.000Z	Bogh	hypercity	from terminal type 'sudo 1' this makes your system go in singleuser mode (rescue), next 'umount /dev/sda2' and run 'fsck /dev/sda2', might want to backup important data first ;-)
2008-07-19T17:59:00.000Z	Bogh	hypercity	sudo init 1
2008-07-19T17:59:00.000Z	hypercity	Bogh	thx
2008-07-19T17:59:00.000Z	Bogh	hypercity	to exit singleuser mode type exit
2008-07-19T18:00:00.000Z	Bogh	hypercity	it's like running scandisk on windows
