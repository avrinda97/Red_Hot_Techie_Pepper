2010-08-28T08:00:00.000Z	edbian	sacarlson	Are you selling $1 ethernet cables?  HOw long are they?!?
2010-08-28T08:01:00.000Z	sacarlson	edbian	I make them I have the tools cost about $1 if shorter than 1 meter
2010-08-28T08:01:00.000Z	edbian	sacarlson	Ahhh but you can't buy $1 worth.
2010-08-28T08:02:00.000Z	sacarlson	edbian	connector 10 baht need 2 so that's 20 baht,  cable is 10 baht per meter  30baht total that's less that $1
2010-08-28T08:03:00.000Z	sacarlson	edbian	 oh and that stuf is more expensive here than in USA.
2010-08-28T08:03:00.000Z	edbian	sacarlson	I'm impressed
2010-09-06T07:16:00.000Z	edbian	sacarlson	That makes no sense.  the bios boots from the motherboard (itself), the bios then tells some partition to boot.
2010-09-06T07:18:00.000Z	sacarlson	edbian	that's correct it boot SOME partition that is controled by settings that can be changed at bios setup.
2011-02-06T10:15:00.000Z	edbian	sacarlson	He doesn't even have it installed yet
2011-02-06T10:40:00.000Z	edbian	sacarlson	Vustom gimp is great :)
2012-06-07T07:10:00.000Z	sacarlson	edbian	I've had similar problem with a usb to ide for laptop disk,  I think the disk doesn't get enuf power off usb to power it
2012-06-07T07:10:00.000Z	sacarlson	edbian	I used old laptop disk that probly take more power then newer ones
2012-06-07T07:11:00.000Z	edbian	sacarlson	It is very old and it is relying on USB power
2012-06-07T07:13:00.000Z	edbian	sacarlson	... what?
2012-06-07T07:13:00.000Z	sacarlson	edbian	ya I think they need more power,  maybe just a usb hub with it's own power might help
2012-06-07T07:14:00.000Z	edbian	sacarlson	stupid everything
2012-06-07T07:15:00.000Z	sacarlson	edbian	I know the laptop disk was good I got an adapter to plug it into a normal ide plug and it worked, so it's the usb to ide on my side that's bad
2012-06-07T07:16:00.000Z	edbian	sacarlson	good to know
