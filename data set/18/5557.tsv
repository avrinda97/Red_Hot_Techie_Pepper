2009-05-16T00:47:00.000Z	Lykkefeen		What is the correct way to hide old kernel versions from the grublist when booting?
2009-05-16T00:47:00.000Z	Slart	Lykkefeen	set the "number of kernels to show" variable..
2009-05-16T00:47:00.000Z	Slart	Lykkefeen	I don't really remember what it's called.. but I can't imagine it would be hard to identify if you look through the menu.lst
2009-05-16T00:48:00.000Z	Lykkefeen	Slart	Should I set it to 1 or is it using any weird notation? :)
2009-05-16T00:48:00.000Z	Slart	Lykkefeen	of course you could also just uninstall the older kernels.. unless you really need tham
2009-05-16T00:48:00.000Z	Slart	Lykkefeen	nothing weird.. 1.. or perhaps 2.. just so you can select an earlier kernel if you really want to
2009-05-16T00:49:00.000Z	Slart	Lykkefeen	don't forget to run "sudo update-grub" when you're finished.. or it won't stick
2009-05-16T00:49:00.000Z	Lykkefeen	Slart	I never use old kernels - do you know how to uninstall them? I like to keep things simple :)
2009-05-16T00:49:00.000Z	Slart	Lykkefeen	apt-get remove or look in synaptic
2009-05-16T00:50:00.000Z	Lykkefeen	Slart	Do you know what I should look/search for @ synaptic?
2009-05-16T00:51:00.000Z	Slart	Lykkefeen	the kernel packages are called "linux-image
2009-05-16T00:51:00.000Z	Slart	Lykkefeen	the kernel packages are called linux-image bla bla bla
2009-05-16T00:52:00.000Z	Slart	Lykkefeen	 you can click "status" and select "installed".. that will only show installed packages
2009-05-16T00:53:00.000Z	Lykkefeen	Slart	Thanks for all the advices - just one quick one: is there any risk in deleting them? I never boot using the old kernels anyway...
2009-05-16T00:54:00.000Z	Lykkefeen	Slart	Oh and should I use complete removal? I probably not going to install old kernels later... :)
2009-05-16T00:54:00.000Z	Slart	Lykkefeen	nah.. as long as you have a working kernel installed there is no reason to keep the old ones
2009-05-16T00:54:00.000Z	Slart	Lykkefeen	complete removal is good
2009-05-16T00:54:00.000Z	Slart	Lykkefeen	I don't think it will remove the grub entries if you just remove it normally
