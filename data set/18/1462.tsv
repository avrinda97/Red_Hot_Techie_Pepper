2012-11-29T00:29:00.000Z	csilk		ubuntu 12.10 -  Unity is really slow on my low powered netbook. Is there something I can do to make it quicker? I know there used to be a 2D mode but that seems to have been removed in 12.10?
2012-11-29T00:29:00.000Z	twirm	csilk	Will you use something that isn't Unity?
2012-11-29T00:31:00.000Z	twirm	csilk	why not?
2012-11-29T00:32:00.000Z	csilk	twirm	this netbook will be used by several people whom don't have time to learn yet another UI. Unity is set up in such a way it meets their needs
2012-11-29T00:33:00.000Z	twirm	csilk	ATOM doesn't have a very good GPU
2012-11-29T00:33:00.000Z	twirm	csilk	is there a reason you moved away from 12.04
2012-11-29T00:33:00.000Z	twirm	csilk	it's LTS :)
2012-11-29T00:33:00.000Z	csilk	twirm	 12.04 had the same unity slowness issues
2012-11-29T00:41:00.000Z	twirm	csilk	but it still runs Unity 2D, you can't ask a 3D desktop to run really well on underpowered hardware
2012-11-29T00:42:00.000Z	csilk	twirm	I don't get why the 3D desktop is the default install option then. It hardly seems like a sound decision
2012-11-29T00:43:00.000Z	twirm	csilk	thus the advantage of Linux, you have a world of options! try setting up XFCE with Docky or something
2012-11-29T00:43:00.000Z	csilk	twirm	 it's not great for a beginner to have to modify things like that
2012-11-29T00:44:00.000Z	twirm	csilk	I assume you are the admin on the box, why don't you set it up for them?
2012-11-29T00:44:00.000Z	csilk	twirm	yes I am, I think you're missing the point though
2012-11-29T00:44:00.000Z	csilk	twirm	not only do I now need to invest time into changing the desktop, I also have to invest time training the users or writing docs
2012-11-29T00:46:00.000Z	twirm	csilk	just see it as a lesson to look for the lowest common denominator in hardware and how you're decisions effect it.
2012-11-29T00:46:00.000Z	csilk	twirm	 your attitude is not aligned with that of people with real work to do. As a hobbyist, I have no issues doing this. From a business stand point, I do
2012-11-29T00:47:00.000Z	twirm	csilk	it seems like you got dogged by your IT guys, check your direct messages
