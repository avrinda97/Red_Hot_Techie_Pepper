2010-01-27T06:47:00.000Z	Checkmate91		Hello...I am trying to recover files from a corrupt XP harddrive and booted to a live Ubuntu CD.  When i run fdisk -l I get nothing but a prompt, how bad is the situation?
2010-01-27T06:49:00.000Z	Checkmate91		chai; i can NOW* see that it is FAT32
2010-01-27T06:51:00.000Z	Checkmate91		chai; mtab says it is mounted but I still canot see it
2010-01-27T06:52:00.000Z	Checkmate91		chai; wait a minute, that drive on /dev/sda1 is my thumbdrive not the harddrive
2010-01-27T06:53:00.000Z	Checkmate91		chai; sudo fdisk -l gives me nothing again
2010-01-27T06:54:00.000Z	Checkmate91		chai, nope
2010-01-27T06:56:00.000Z	Checkmate91		chai, even on a live cd?
2010-01-27T06:57:00.000Z	Checkmate91		chai, as far as the XP drive itself is concerned, when I boot from that it might/might not make it as far as the wavy logo screen and then it just restarts all over again
2010-01-27T06:58:00.000Z	Checkmate91		chai, typically I can get data off these things but this one is stubborn
2010-01-27T06:59:00.000Z	Gstar	Checkmate91	what does a df show?
2010-01-27T07:01:00.000Z	Checkmate91	Gstar	little bit about the kernel, some stuff on /var more on /dev and /tmp
2010-01-27T07:02:00.000Z	Gstar	Checkmate91	sounds like its not mounted to me
2010-01-27T07:02:00.000Z	Checkmate91	Gstar	I agree but I think Ubuntu does not know it is there for mounting
2010-01-27T07:03:00.000Z	Gstar	Checkmate91	have your tried mounting it manually?
2010-01-27T07:04:00.000Z	Checkmate91	Gstar	with something like mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/sda1 /media/disk -o force
2010-01-27T07:04:00.000Z	Checkmate91	Gstar	the thing is fdisk -l does not see this harddrive
2010-01-27T07:06:00.000Z	Gstar	Checkmate91	your mounting wrong
2010-01-27T07:06:00.000Z	Checkmate91	Gstar	suggestion?
