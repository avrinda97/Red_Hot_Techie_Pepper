2012-04-12T21:28:00.000Z	adrien2		What does it mean when a linux box has been "rooted"
2012-04-12T21:29:00.000Z	adrien2		I saw it mentioned around, though I can't find an explaination.
2012-04-12T21:29:00.000Z	dackyshawn	adrien2	someone has root
2012-04-12T21:30:00.000Z	dackyshawn	adrien2	it's not "locked" it's just not set
2012-04-12T21:33:00.000Z	dackyshawn	adrien2	if they access to another sudo account and set the passwd then yes
2012-04-12T21:37:00.000Z	dackyshawn	adrien2	i dont know of any "backdoor" method for privelge escalation if that's your question... I do know if you have an account with sudo rights then yes they can in theory gain "root" permissions using your account assuming they can get into your account
2012-04-12T21:38:00.000Z	dackyshawn	adrien2	this is assuming u have something like ssh or telnet set up
2012-04-12T21:39:00.000Z	dackyshawn	adrien2	but in my opinion someone would havwe to really want access to spend the time doing all that
2012-04-12T21:41:00.000Z	dackyshawn	adrien2	are u sure it isnt a firewall issue?
2012-04-12T21:42:00.000Z	dackyshawn	adrien2	is your ubuntu server at the head of the network?
2012-04-12T21:42:00.000Z	dackyshawn	adrien2	that doesnt matter
2012-04-12T21:42:00.000Z	dackyshawn	adrien2	no i was wondering cuz it should be open if u never configured IPTables
2012-04-12T21:45:00.000Z	dackyshawn	adrien2	that doesnt matter
2012-04-12T21:45:00.000Z	dackyshawn	adrien2	if i try to get into your ubuntu machine i'm only get as far as your router
2012-04-12T21:47:00.000Z	dackyshawn	adrien2	make sure your router is set to forward port 6667 to the ubuntu machine
2012-04-12T21:48:00.000Z	dackyshawn	adrien2	does your ubuntu machine have an IP in the 192.168.x.x range or something like that
2012-04-12T21:49:00.000Z	dackyshawn	adrien2	u misunderstand
2012-04-12T21:49:00.000Z	dackyshawn	adrien2	it does accept all but thats cuz it should
