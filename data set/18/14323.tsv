2005-09-02T09:09:00.000Z	tomaj		i'm having trouble connecting to X from any tty other than 7 (which is gnome) can someone help me fix it?
2005-09-02T09:09:00.000Z	persia	tomaj	Have you looked in /etc/gdm/gdm.conf?
2005-09-02T09:12:00.000Z	tomaj	persia	where is the file that's used by the startup launcher in gnome?
2005-09-02T09:12:00.000Z	persia	tomaj	Startup Launcher?
2005-09-02T09:13:00.000Z	tomaj	persia	in sessions > startup programs
2005-09-02T09:14:00.000Z	tomaj	persia	well system > preferences >sessions... in the gnome menu
2005-09-02T09:16:00.000Z	persia	tomaj	MY apologies.  I cannot find the config file right now.
2005-09-02T09:17:00.000Z	tomaj	persia	that's alright :)
2005-09-02T09:20:00.000Z	tomaj	persia	i can't seem to find anything related, but im not sure what i'm looking for lol any tips?
2005-09-02T09:21:00.000Z	persia	tomaj	The general X sesssion is in .xsession, but I would look in ~/.gnome2 first.  I'll look for it again.
2005-09-02T09:22:00.000Z	tomaj	persia	the problem is that when i try to run azuerus throught DISPLAY=:0 /usr/bin/azureus i get an error saying that connection was refused to the xserver
2005-09-02T09:22:00.000Z	persia	tomaj	I found it: ~/.gnome2/session.
2005-09-02T09:23:00.000Z	persia	tomaj	Ah: that sounds like an x permissions error.  The method I used to use for that is widely considered harmful, and I haven't found a new one.  I probably can't help with that.  Sorry.
2005-09-02T09:24:00.000Z	tomaj	persia	where did you find yours?
2005-09-02T09:24:00.000Z	persia	tomaj	my what?
2005-09-02T09:24:00.000Z	tomaj	persia	your method for solving the permissions problem
2005-09-02T09:25:00.000Z	persia	tomaj	Some old docs that came with SunOS 4.1.4: it's not useful current information.
