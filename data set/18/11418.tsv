2006-10-20T12:45:00.000Z	JamieBE		Would someone give me a hand with a Samba problem please?
2006-10-20T12:47:00.000Z	JamieBE		Someone, help with Samba please?
2006-10-20T12:48:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	JamieBE	what do you need?
2006-10-20T12:49:00.000Z	JamieBE	nolimitsoya	All other folders share perfectly, just this one for external USB drive
2006-10-20T12:49:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	JamieBE	just share the folder your drive is mounted in, no?
2006-10-20T12:50:00.000Z	JamieBE	nolimitsoya	Drive is mounted, all share parameters appear correct, and modified like all other functional shares.
2006-10-20T12:53:00.000Z	JamieBE	nolimitsoya	I must have asked this question 10 times now and nobody has solved it yet. It seems very obvious.
2006-10-20T12:53:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	JamieBE	i have no idea, what happens if you share one step up in the tree?
2006-10-20T12:54:00.000Z	JamieBE	nolimitsoya	You mean to share the entire /mount/VAULT directory? - I'll give it a go and see...
2006-10-20T12:54:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	JamieBE	no!
2006-10-20T12:55:00.000Z	JamieBE	nolimitsoya	?
2006-10-20T12:56:00.000Z	JamieBE	nolimitsoya	"fex"?
2006-10-20T12:56:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	JamieBE	for example :)
2006-10-20T12:56:00.000Z	JamieBE	nolimitsoya	ALL shares in my home DIR work ok, just the external drive directories that won't share :(
2006-10-20T12:57:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	JamieBE	as i said, mount in you home folder, and share one step above th mount
2006-10-20T12:57:00.000Z	JamieBE	nolimitsoya	I think I see what you are saying - What is the command for mounting the drive?
2006-10-20T13:07:00.000Z	JamieBE	nolimitsoya	I did "sudo mount -t vfat /dev/sda1 /home/jamie/.share" and then shared it but still get the same error
2006-10-20T13:12:00.000Z	JamieBE	nolimitsoya	We're close - I can feel it in my marrow!!
