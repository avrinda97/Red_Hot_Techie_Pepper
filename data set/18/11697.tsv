2006-06-22T16:30:00.000Z	[HHS] Dawnwater	Killuminati	That guide would've helped, about 36 hours ago. The problem is not that I cant patch the game, I just can't play it, at least, the opengl mode wont let me to. I dont think this is in your reach, so I'll carry on
2006-06-22T16:34:00.000Z	[HHS] Dawnwater	Killuminati	Where should I add those lines?
2006-06-22T16:38:00.000Z	[HHS] Dawnwater	Killuminati	there is still some fun in here. We just caused the whole game to appear upside down xD
2006-06-22T16:39:00.000Z	[HHS] Dawnwater	Killuminati	A bit, with double desktop buffering off
2006-06-22T16:45:00.000Z	[HHS] Dawnwater	Killuminati	Yes, a badmatch if that says anything to you
2006-06-22T16:47:00.000Z	[HHS] Dawnwater	Killuminati	I did, deleted the file
2006-06-22T16:48:00.000Z	[HHS] Dawnwater	Killuminati	there is no such runonce.wtf
2006-06-22T16:51:00.000Z	[HHS] Dawnwater	Killuminati	no change, the game is as fucked up as it was before
2006-06-22T16:52:00.000Z	[HHS] Dawnwater	Killuminati	how come you're so sure
2006-06-22T16:53:00.000Z	[HHS] Dawnwater	Killuminati	it is, now I created it as you said
2006-06-22T05:33:00.000Z	[HHS] Dawnwater	Killuminati	Thanks for all the help mate, I got WoW working ^^
2006-06-22T05:33:00.000Z	[HHS] Dawnwater	Killuminati	I downloaded wine 0.9.5, applied two patches and it worked xD
2006-06-22T05:34:00.000Z	[HHS] Dawnwater	Killuminati	Thanks, and thanks again
2006-06-22T05:35:00.000Z	[HHS] Dawnwater	Killuminati	You did bother, that helped
