2009-07-30T20:49:00.000Z	CosmiChaos		how do i soft reboot into bios, when i click on eboot it only reboots linux without hardresetting the computer, what is wrong???
2009-07-30T20:49:00.000Z	CosmiChaos		i too cant access grub wtf
2009-07-30T20:50:00.000Z	CosmiChaos		do i have to shutdown my computer to hard-reboot???
2009-07-30T20:52:00.000Z	CosmiChaos		i dont want restart linux i want reBOOT
2009-07-30T20:54:00.000Z	pepperjack	CosmiChaos	here is a trick for you: sudo echo b > /proc/sysrq-trigger   :)
2009-07-30T20:55:00.000Z	pepperjack	CosmiChaos	carefule that will reboot though
2009-07-30T20:55:00.000Z	pepperjack	CosmiChaos	not cleanly
2009-07-30T20:55:00.000Z	CosmiChaos	pepperjack	what does that do?
2009-07-30T20:55:00.000Z	pepperjack	CosmiChaos	kinda like hitting reset button on pc
2009-07-30T20:56:00.000Z	CosmiChaos	pepperjack	i want it to properly unmount my ext4 thanks
2009-07-30T20:56:00.000Z	pepperjack	CosmiChaos	there are a number of commands for clean reboot.  for instance sudo shutdown -r now  or sudo reboot
2009-07-30T20:57:00.000Z	CosmiChaos	pepperjack	well that sudo reboot is doing the same thing than hitting on reboot no bios
2009-07-30T20:57:00.000Z	pepperjack	CosmiChaos	if you still see the same issue then it would have to be some quick boot bios setting causing it not ubuntu
2009-07-30T20:57:00.000Z	pepperjack	CosmiChaos	during quickboot you can still hit the proper key like f1 or f8 or whatever is specific to your comp to get into the bios
2009-07-30T20:57:00.000Z	CosmiChaos	pepperjack	there is no bios feature in the world that lets you skip loading the bios, it is ubuntu problem just reloading the kernel but noot resetting the mashine before
2009-07-30T20:58:00.000Z	CosmiChaos	pepperjack	i will try that now
2009-07-30T21:00:00.000Z	CosmiChaos	pepperjack	that did not work as i said
2009-07-30T21:00:00.000Z	CosmiChaos	pepperjack	it immediately loads ubuntu again not accepting f8 or del
