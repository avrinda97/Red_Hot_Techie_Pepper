2009-03-21T09:07:00.000Z	oDesk		hello, i've installed version of Ubuntu 7.10 and i want to upgrade to Jaunty 9 from the CD
2009-03-21T09:08:00.000Z	oDesk		how i would go ?
2009-03-21T09:08:00.000Z	devilsadvocate	oDesk	that is not a very good idea.
2009-03-21T09:08:00.000Z	oDesk	devilsadvocate	but my files.. installations..
2009-03-21T09:09:00.000Z	devilsadvocate	oDesk	you should upgrade from 7.10>8.04>8.10>9.04 , and it would be easier on the network (although i concede pretty heavy on bandwidth usage)
2009-03-21T09:09:00.000Z	oDesk	devilsadvocate	what about the desk space required to do all these upgrades
2009-03-21T09:09:00.000Z	devilsadvocate	oDesk	a direct upgrade from 7.10 > 9.04 can be tortorous
2009-03-21T09:10:00.000Z	devilsadvocate	oDesk	should not be much. i'd keep about a GB of free space or so
2009-03-21T09:10:00.000Z	devilsadvocate	oDesk	you should do an apt-cache clean occasionally to free up some space if you have a disk size problem
2009-03-21T09:14:00.000Z	oDesk	devilsadvocate	so if i've 2G, i can apply all upgrades!..  apt-cache clean  #-> invalid operation clean
2009-03-21T09:14:00.000Z	devilsadvocate	oDesk	let me check the command
2009-03-21T09:15:00.000Z	devilsadvocate	oDesk	my apologies. it was apt-get clean
2009-03-21T09:15:00.000Z	oDesk	devilsadvocate	there was about 100MB, thanks
2009-03-21T09:16:00.000Z	oDesk	devilsadvocate	then 2G is enough ?
2009-03-21T09:16:00.000Z	devilsadvocate	oDesk	it should be
2009-03-21T09:16:00.000Z	devilsadvocate		ultimately depends on how many applications you have, but i would be surprised if you need more than 1g per upgrade
2009-03-21T09:16:00.000Z	oDesk	devilsadvocate	thanks
2009-03-21T09:16:00.000Z	devilsadvocate	oDesk	^
