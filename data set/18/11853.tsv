2006-06-27T16:30:00.000Z	Paladine		just not all 32bit apps have been ported
2006-06-27T16:31:00.000Z	Paladine		final - man alsamixer is what I used earlier today

2006-06-27T16:34:00.000Z	Paladine		I posted this in ubu amd64 forum 7 hours ago andso far no ideas have been forthcoming, anyone mind taking a look at the problem? ( http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=204030 )
2006-06-27T16:35:00.000Z	Paladine		ubu should have stolen the screen from windows XP installation that says "Windows just got better..." and dumped it into their install ;)
2006-06-27T16:37:00.000Z	Paladine		so who wants to fix this for me: ./cxinstallwizard:error: error initializing Tk: 'this isn't a Tk applicationunknown color name "Black"'
2006-06-27T16:37:00.000Z	nickrud	Paladine	it'd try looking thru synaptic, and installing the latest tk so your installer can find it.
2006-06-27T16:40:00.000Z	nickrud	Paladine	you may have an older app there, that doesn't look where ubuntu puts the libs
2006-06-27T16:44:00.000Z	nickrud	Paladine	if that was for me, I leave all sound to my betters, every time I try I work poeple into corners
2006-06-27T16:44:00.000Z	Paladine	nickrud	well i am already in a corner hehe, so if you wanna have a look at http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=204030 and have any ideas, I won't blame you if it doesn't work :)
2006-06-27T16:46:00.000Z	nickrud	Paladine	yup, that's not even a corner I'm familiar with :)
2006-06-27T16:48:00.000Z	nickrud	Paladine	watch for crimsun in this space, he's used to me flagging his name :)
2006-06-27T05:27:00.000Z	nickrud	Paladine	font issues. That much I'll say, but the fix? meh
2006-06-27T05:29:00.000Z	nickrud	Paladine	not a clue. I live by openoffice, so I hope never to see that :)
