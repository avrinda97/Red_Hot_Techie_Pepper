2009-12-08T04:09:00.000Z	logankoester		I recently did an apt-get upgrade which must have included some xorg packages, and now X crashes randomly every few minutes (intel hardware) - how do I begin diagnosing such a problem?
2009-12-08T04:10:00.000Z	DasEi	logankoester	/var/log/syslog, /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2009-12-08T04:11:00.000Z	DasEi	logankoester	how long ago the last update was ?
2009-12-08T04:12:00.000Z	logankoester	DasEi	2 days ago
2009-12-08T04:12:00.000Z	logankoester	DasEi	it was a large upgrade, probably a couple months worth of packages
2009-12-08T04:12:00.000Z	DasEi	logankoester	did you try to boot safemode > netroot for dhcp, then dpkg-repair.. ?
2009-12-08T04:13:00.000Z	logankoester	DasEi	I did not, how is dhcp involved?
2009-12-08T04:13:00.000Z	DasEi	logankoester	is just to ge inet for the update
2009-12-08T04:15:00.000Z	logankoester	DasEi	nothing in my path called "dpkg-repair"...
2009-12-08T04:16:00.000Z	DasEi	logankoester	the two  thingys are choices from the safemode (no x involved) menu
2009-12-08T04:17:00.000Z	logankoester	DasEi	okay, I'll try that
2009-12-08T04:17:00.000Z	logankoester	DasEi	just a second.. (thanks, by the way)
2009-12-08T04:19:00.000Z	logankoester	DasEi	okay, dpkg repair is installing a whole mess of stuff... some of it xserver and intel related...
2009-12-08T04:19:00.000Z	DasEi	logankoester	I give a candle, now cross fingers  ;-)
2009-12-08T04:20:00.000Z	logankoester	DasEi	does the fact that dpkg repair is installing stuff mean that the upgrade did in fact fail in some way?
2009-12-08T04:21:00.000Z	logankoester	DasEi	like, can i rule out the problem being caused by the new versions of software?
2009-12-08T04:22:00.000Z	DasEi	logankoester	not in fact, but some packages are often held back with gdm active which seldom can cause this
2009-12-08T04:22:00.000Z	logankoester	DasEi	ahh okay, that makes sense
