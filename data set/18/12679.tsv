2006-11-24T09:00:00.000Z	stalefries		Does anyone here use seahorse?
2006-11-24T09:01:00.000Z	stalefries		at the end
2006-11-24T09:02:00.000Z	stalefries		Bummer, I was hoping someone could help me with seahorse. I'll check google/the forums
2006-11-24T09:02:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	stalefries	Perhaps - what about it?
2006-11-24T09:02:00.000Z	stalefries	tonyyarusso	network key sharing
2006-11-24T09:03:00.000Z	stalefries	tonyyarusso	I get errors about loading something or other on login, pretty non-descript
2006-11-24T09:03:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	stalefries	Hmm, sorry.  I got nothing on that.
2006-11-24T09:03:00.000Z	stalefries	tonyyarusso	oh well
2006-11-24T09:04:00.000Z	stalefries	tonyyarusso	don't even know what it would do, but sounds interesting :)
2006-11-24T09:11:00.000Z	stalefries	tonyyarusso	it seems I need some sort of zeroconf networking
2006-11-24T09:12:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	stalefries	Aaah.
2006-11-24T09:13:00.000Z	stalefries	tonyyarusso	it was because one of my ram slots borked
2006-11-24T09:13:00.000Z	stalefries	tonyyarusso	I later bought a stick of 256, that's all I have now
2006-11-24T09:36:00.000Z	stalefries	tonyyarusso	I can't find anything on the seahorse network key sharing!
2006-11-24T09:37:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	stalefries	Does seahorse have an irc channel?
2006-11-24T09:38:00.000Z	stalefries	tonyyarusso	haven't checked
2006-11-24T09:38:00.000Z	stalefries	tonyyarusso	yes, #seahorse!
2006-11-24T09:38:00.000Z	stalefries	tonyyarusso	but the only other 2 people on are away
