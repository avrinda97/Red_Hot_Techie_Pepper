2005-09-02T13:21:00.000Z	elvirolo		how do i know if a usb device is detected ?
2005-09-02T13:22:00.000Z	HappyFool	elvirolo	try 'lsusb'
2005-09-02T13:22:00.000Z	HappyFool	elvirolo	also, you can look at the output of 'dmesg' just before and after you plug it in
2005-09-02T13:22:00.000Z	elvirolo	HappyFool	oh i should have thought of that, thansks :)
2005-09-08T05:36:00.000Z	HappyFool	elvirolo	i think breezy is still for developers, not for end-users
2005-09-08T05:36:00.000Z	elvirolo	HappyFool	well, it is, but they have passed the feature freeze haven't they ?
2005-09-08T05:37:00.000Z	HappyFool	elvirolo	i don't know; however, everytime i come onto irc there is someone with a weird new breezy problem
2005-09-08T05:38:00.000Z	elvirolo	HappyFool	you can't even imagine the number of weird probs i have with *hoary* !
2005-09-08T05:39:00.000Z	HappyFool	elvirolo	yeah, but hoary isn't a moving target for fixes. anyway, if you can risk losing your machine, or taking time to fix odd problems, go for it.
2005-09-08T05:39:00.000Z	elvirolo	HappyFool	well, again, it works,on my separate partition
2005-09-08T12:05:00.000Z	HappyFool	elvirolo	i'd go read the ubunut-devel mailing lists
2005-09-08T12:06:00.000Z	elvirolo	HappyFool	well i did have a look there ...
2005-09-08T12:06:00.000Z	HappyFool	elvirolo	ppl here were talking about modprobing mouse drivers or something last night (here on #ubuntu), but i don't remember the details
2005-09-08T12:06:00.000Z	elvirolo	HappyFool	never mind, thx anyway :)
2005-10-15T11:33:00.000Z	HappyFool	elvirolo	by?
2005-10-15T11:33:00.000Z	elvirolo	HappyFool	by the very serious bugs it suffers
2005-10-15T11:34:00.000Z	HappyFool	elvirolo	i suspect this is not the forum for such a discussion. many people seem to be successfully using the release candidate
2005-10-15T11:36:00.000Z	elvirolo	HappyFool	well : http://bugzilla.ubuntu.com/show_bug.cgi?id=16066 http://bugzilla.ubuntu.com/show_bug.cgi?id=14566 http://bugzilla.ubuntu.com/show_bug.cgi?id=15809
