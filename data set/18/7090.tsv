2008-02-08T09:30:00.000Z	_Oz_		hello all
2008-02-08T09:30:00.000Z	_Oz_		I'm a recent Ubuntu convert
2008-02-08T09:31:00.000Z	_Oz_		I must say...  I am highly impressed
2008-02-08T09:31:00.000Z	_Oz_		The only thing I can't do is run Photoshop
2008-02-08T09:31:00.000Z	_Oz_		Everything else works like a charm.
2008-02-08T09:31:00.000Z	singlesun	_Oz_	can you run photoshop through wine?
2008-02-08T09:34:00.000Z	singlesun	_Oz_	that is all LInux's biggest weakness especially when it comes to wpa
2008-02-08T09:37:00.000Z	singlesun	_Oz_	i suggest the book "Running Linux"
2008-02-08T09:38:00.000Z	singlesun	_Oz_	based upon the channel listing at the moment this is the most popular channel.. so?
2008-02-08T09:40:00.000Z	singlesun	_Oz_	a little suggestion is going to Places > Home and then in the menu telling it to "show hidden files"
2008-02-08T09:41:00.000Z	_Oz_	singlesun	yeah, already did that, that's how I found .wine
2008-02-09T02:38:00.000Z	singlesun	_Oz_	well its good to see you still... everything going well so far? photoshop problem solved?
2008-02-18T18:16:00.000Z	singlesun	_Oz_	wow... last time i was in here you were new to ubuntu... glad to see you are sticking it out ;)
2008-02-18T18:17:00.000Z	_Oz_	singlesun	still pretty new to it but rapidly getting more comfortable
2008-02-18T18:18:00.000Z	singlesun	_Oz_	run virtualbox .. install xp onto it... then you never really have to "leave ubuntu" lol
2008-02-18T18:18:00.000Z	_Oz_	singlesun	yeah, that doesn't really work from a practical perspective
2008-02-18T18:19:00.000Z	singlesun	_Oz_	ok... in that scenario i would have a mac solely dedicated to desktop publishing...  ;)
2008-02-18T18:19:00.000Z	_Oz_	singlesun	heheheheh
