2008-02-20T21:40:00.000Z	cicero_b		secure ftp server in ubuntu -- hard?
2008-02-20T21:41:00.000Z	ejer	cicero_b	it is installed with ssh
2008-02-20T21:41:00.000Z	cicero_b	ejer	cool -- how can i see if it is running (daemon)?
2008-02-20T21:41:00.000Z	ejer	cicero_b	if you installed ssh it starts up when someone connects
2008-02-20T21:42:00.000Z	cicero_b	ejer	how can i configure it?
2008-02-20T21:42:00.000Z	ejer	cicero_b	for what, what do you want to do
2008-02-20T21:43:00.000Z	ejer	cicero_b	it is already setup, have you tried it? read this for more info http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH_file_transfer_protocol
2008-02-20T21:43:00.000Z	ejer	cicero_b	ftp != sftp
2008-02-20T21:44:00.000Z	ejer	cicero_b	an easy way is to use konqueror, use address 'sftp://youruser@you.ip.add.ress'
2008-02-20T21:45:00.000Z	ejer	cicero_b	ftp is insecure
2008-02-20T21:47:00.000Z	ejer	cicero_b	you are going to need to read up on ssh and configs... this gets more complex than I can explain in a chat room
2008-02-20T21:47:00.000Z	ejer	cicero_b	the website you need to upload to is not yours, right?
2008-02-20T21:47:00.000Z	cicero_b	ejer	it is my website .. .
2008-02-20T21:48:00.000Z	ejer	cicero_b	if ssh is installed on it and you have a valid user that can login, you are set
2008-02-20T21:48:00.000Z	ejer	cicero_b	from command line you can also use 'scp thisfile youruser@yourothermachine:/home/youruser/'
2008-02-20T21:50:00.000Z	ejer	cicero_b	no, not unless the windows machine is running ssh
2008-02-20T21:51:00.000Z	cicero_b	ejer	should i look into that or is sftp fine . . .
2008-02-20T21:51:00.000Z	ejer	cicero_b	sftp is great for transferring to linux machine, the best maybe
