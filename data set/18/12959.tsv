2007-12-04T16:24:00.000Z	pluffsy		hi
2007-12-04T16:25:00.000Z	pluffsy		I want to run sudo /etc/network/if-up.d/ntpdate every now and then in crontab to keep my clock on time. How do I run something as root in crontab?
2007-12-04T16:26:00.000Z	clever	pluffsy	use ntpd
2007-12-04T16:26:00.000Z	clever	pluffsy	that runs 24/7 and checks every now and then on its own
2007-12-04T16:27:00.000Z	pluffsy	clever	can I just sudo apt-get install ntpd and it will configure itself?
2007-12-04T16:27:00.000Z	clever	pluffsy	should i beleive
2007-12-04T16:28:00.000Z	pluffsy	clever	kind of hard to see if it doesn't run as it should. Or well I guess I'll see in a few weeks :)
2007-12-04T16:28:00.000Z	clever	pluffsy	just ps aux|grep ntp
2007-12-04T16:28:00.000Z	clever	pluffsy	youll see if its running
2007-12-04T16:29:00.000Z	pluffsy	clever	yeah, of course. thanks.
2007-12-04T16:32:00.000Z	pluffsy	clever	sorry for all the questions. there are no ntpd. Will openntpd do?
2007-12-04T16:32:00.000Z	clever	pluffsy	it may be part of the ntpdate package
2007-12-04T16:33:00.000Z	clever	pluffsy	check if you allready have a /usr/sbin/ntpd
2007-12-04T16:33:00.000Z	pluffsy	clever	nope. just ntpdate.
2007-12-04T16:34:00.000Z	clever	pluffsy	try the other ntp package then
2007-12-04T16:34:00.000Z	clever		cant hurt
2007-12-04T16:34:00.000Z	pluffsy	clever	I'm running 7.04 not 7.10 btw. if that makes  a difference.
2007-12-04T16:34:00.000Z	pluffsy	clever	ok I'll try. thanks
