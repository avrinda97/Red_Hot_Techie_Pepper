2008-10-11T06:36:00.000Z	lucax		is it possible to switch from emerald to metacity without turning compiz off??
2008-10-11T06:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lucax	no as you can only have 1 window manager per X server
2008-10-11T06:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lucax	metacity --replace will switch from compiz to metacity
2008-10-11T06:40:00.000Z	lucax	ActionParsnip	ok, but it will turn compiz off
2008-11-21T19:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lucax	is it internal or external?
2008-11-21T19:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lucax	lspci will show you what you have, you can websearch from there
2008-11-21T19:57:00.000Z	lucax	ActionParsnip	its internal intel wireless
2008-11-21T19:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lucax	then lspci will say what it is
2008-11-21T19:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lucax	you can then websearch for a solution using that info
2008-11-21T20:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lucax	did you install drivers for the device?
2008-11-21T20:10:00.000Z	lucax	ActionParsnip	nope, it was working before i did an install of kernel -8 which was in the proposed updates, but ive uninstall it and went back to the other kernel and now wlan doesnt work
2008-11-21T20:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lucax	then you need the kernel module for your new kernel
2008-11-21T20:11:00.000Z	lucax	ActionParsnip	whats the package name?
2008-11-21T20:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lucax	it depends on what lspci says the wifi is, i doubt its a package too
2008-11-21T20:20:00.000Z	lucax	ActionParsnip	in ifconfig i dont see wlan
2008-11-21T20:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lucax	what does lspci say you have/
