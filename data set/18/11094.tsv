2006-09-15T07:14:00.000Z	CrippsFX	OofCZer0	choose ubuntu.
2006-09-15T07:14:00.000Z	OofCZer0	CrippsFX	it doesnt give me the option
2006-09-15T07:14:00.000Z	OofCZer0	CrippsFX	it just boots windows
2006-09-15T07:14:00.000Z	CrippsFX	OofCZer0	oh, sorry, I missed the "doesn't" there.
2006-09-15T07:15:00.000Z	CrippsFX	OofCZer0	stick in the ubuntu cd, and boot it up in rescue mode.
2006-09-15T07:15:00.000Z	OofCZer0	CrippsFX	anything after that or just do that then restart and take the cd out?
2006-09-15T07:16:00.000Z	CrippsFX	OofCZer0	yep ... you're going to need to edit your /boot/grub/menu.lst  ... and then you're going to need to make sure grub installed to your mbr
2006-09-15T07:17:00.000Z	OofCZer0	CrippsFX	so u know i have never used ubuntu or any type of linux before this so i dont really know what your talking about, if you coudl explain that in a little more detail it would be much appreciated
2006-09-15T07:18:00.000Z	CrippsFX	OofCZer0	when you boot up, you will need to run "nano /boot/grub/menu.lst" and add an entry for ubuntu in there ... just a moment and I'll find you a grub how to
2006-09-15T07:19:00.000Z	OofCZer0	CrippsFX	thanks
2006-09-15T07:22:00.000Z	CrippsFX	OofCZer0	http://www.faqs.org/docs/Linux-mini/Multiboot-with-GRUB.html   ... or you can check out the link cynical posted ... another option is to check out the "Linux Documentation Project"
2006-09-15T07:25:00.000Z	OofCZer0	CrippsFX	i dont get what im supposed to do, im at the link, i dont get what im supposed to do, sorry :-\
2006-09-15T07:26:00.000Z	CrippsFX	OofCZer0	sorry ... I'm tied up right now ... if you keep re-reading it, it'll eventually make sense.
2006-09-15T07:29:00.000Z	OofCZer0	CrippsFX	so i guess i just go to that file and change it to make it say what is on the page???
2006-09-15T07:30:00.000Z	CrippsFX	OofCZer0	that would be a start ... keeping in mind partition scheme and such. i.e. hd(0,0) is the first partition on the first HD, hd(1,0) is the first partition on the second hd, hd(1,1) is the second partition on the second HD, etc, etc ....
