2010-05-06T15:58:00.000Z	casual		could anyone please tell me how to fsck my hard disk?
2010-05-06T15:58:00.000Z	erUSUL	casual	from a livecd with gparted ?
2010-05-06T15:59:00.000Z	casual	erUSUL	yes I'm using that, but HOW do you do it?
2010-05-06T15:59:00.000Z	erUSUL	casual	afaik you can force a fsck on next boot of the root partition. do «sudo touch /forcefsck» reboot
2010-05-06T15:59:00.000Z	casual	erUSUL	it's encrypted
2010-05-06T15:59:00.000Z	casual	erUSUL	its total disk encrypted
2010-05-06T15:59:00.000Z	erUSUL	casual	right click on the desired partition. choose fsck (or whatever they call it should be pretty obvious)
2010-05-06T16:02:00.000Z	casual	erUSUL	how do you preform fsck from gparted?
2010-05-06T16:03:00.000Z	erUSUL	casual	already told you... right click on the partition you want to fsck. choose the right option there
2010-05-06T16:04:00.000Z	casual	erUSUL	there is no such option
2010-05-06T16:04:00.000Z	erUSUL	casual	is called Check
2010-05-06T16:05:00.000Z	casual	erUSUL	that option is grayed out
2010-05-06T16:05:00.000Z	erUSUL	casual	is a ntfs partition ?
2010-05-06T16:05:00.000Z	casual	erUSUL	crypt-luka
2010-05-06T16:06:00.000Z	erUSUL	casual	is the partition mounted ? you have to umount them before fscking
2010-05-06T16:06:00.000Z	casual	erUSUL	it isnt mounted
2010-05-06T16:07:00.000Z	erUSUL	casual	then i dunno; should ask someone familiar with encrypted partitions... i do not use them
