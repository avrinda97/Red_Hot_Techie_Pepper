2009-05-16T07:39:00.000Z	Linuz2009		can you tune-up ubuntu?
2009-05-16T07:41:00.000Z	Piet	Linuz2009	you can disable daemons you don't need, change to a less resource hungry window manager, remove unneeded applications etc.
2009-05-16T07:41:00.000Z	Linuz2009	Piet	what's a daemon?
2009-05-16T07:41:00.000Z	Piet	Linuz2009	a background process
2009-05-16T07:43:00.000Z	Linuz2009	Piet	so you meaning turning, does that imply that I need to switch to one color similar process as windows?
2009-05-16T07:44:00.000Z	Piet	Linuz2009	i read this sentence zwice but i don't get wgat you are trying to ask, sorry.
2009-05-16T07:44:00.000Z	Piet	Linuz2009	i read this sentence twice but i don't get what you are trying to ask, sorry.
2009-05-16T07:44:00.000Z	Piet	Linuz2009	and sorry for my bad spelling, too
2009-05-16T07:45:00.000Z	Linuz2009	Piet	okay let me put it this way, in windows you can turn to window classic to optimize speed and switch the background to gray or none but in ubuntu how can I turn off the background?
2009-05-16T07:48:00.000Z	Piet	Linuz2009	ah, now I understand. yes, this is one thing you can do: you can deactivate compiz for example. this can alread remarkably increase speed of the window manager.
2009-05-16T07:48:00.000Z	Piet	Linuz2009	you can also change the background image or decrease the overall color depth
2009-05-16T07:49:00.000Z	Piet	Linuz2009	but what I meant iniitally is that you can replace the complete window manager, known as gnome, by another which is less resource hungry.
2009-05-16T07:49:00.000Z	Piet	Linuz2009	this can be fluxbox, openwm, wmii, ratware, or whatever.
2009-05-16T07:51:00.000Z	Piet	Linuz2009	but before you start on "tweaking" you should be aware which changes actually make sense for your system. start by checking the current resource utilization
2009-05-16T07:51:00.000Z	Linuz2009	Piet	how about the app remove orphans
2009-05-16T07:52:00.000Z	Piet	Linuz2009	this will free up some disk space and is no loss to do, so this is a good measure.
2009-05-16T07:53:00.000Z	Linuz2009	Piet	then how can I remove services?
2009-05-16T07:54:00.000Z	Piet	Linuz2009	use one of the package managing frontends such as add/remove applications, synaptic, aptitude, apt-get, dpkg
