2006-03-20T11:46:00.000Z	linkd	amish	i think the msn servers dont like u.
2006-03-20T11:47:00.000Z	linkd	amish	thats all normal output except for when it randomly "disconnects" you which sometimes the msn servers will do if they think something is wrong
2006-03-20T11:47:00.000Z	linkd	amish	sure passwords and whatnot ok?
2006-03-20T11:48:00.000Z	linkd	amish	i dont know what to suggest :/

2006-03-20T11:51:00.000Z	linkd	amish	ok its just looking for repos that it cant find (i.e. the ones on the CD) either: insert the cd, or u can comment it out from the /etc/apt/source.list file (it should be near the top)
2006-03-20T11:54:00.000Z	amish	linkd	what one do i need to uncomment
2006-03-20T12:00:00.000Z	linkd	amish	i meant just find the deb report which is ur CD and put a "#" in front of that line
2006-03-20T12:00:00.000Z	linkd	amish	not uncomment. _comment_
