2012-05-17T04:20:00.000Z	dimholt		Hey guys. A new Linux user here who needs help formatting my drive. It doesn't work... Can someone help me?
2012-05-17T04:22:00.000Z	escott	dimholt	how big is the disk?
2012-05-17T04:22:00.000Z	dimholt	escott	it's 300gb.
2012-05-17T04:24:00.000Z	escott	dimholt	i'd certainly use the gui, or use "parted" instead of fdisk. if the computer is more or less brand new it might have gpt/uefi in which case fdisk is not the correct partitioning tool. you dont get any warnings messages from fdisk?
2012-05-17T04:25:00.000Z	dimholt	escott	Yeah, there was a warning, good you mentioned it. Problem is, everything fucked up when I tried to install new nVidia drivers. X broke completely. When I tried to fix it, I ended up with just a black screen with a blinking caret. Now running from bootUSB to reformat and redo everything.
2012-05-17T04:26:00.000Z	dimholt	escott	one sec, I'll check the warning.
2012-05-17T04:29:00.000Z	dimholt	escott	error is "WARNING: Re-reading the partition table failed with error 22: Invalid argument. The kernel still uses the old table. The new table will be used at the next reboot or after you run partprobe(8) or kpartx(8)"
2012-05-17T04:29:00.000Z	escott	dimholt	thats usually not a problem. just means you need to run the command partprobe to get the kernel to update the table, once you reboot the kernel will reread anyways
2012-05-17T04:30:00.000Z	dimholt	escott	I figured, but it doesn't. I
2012-05-17T04:30:00.000Z	escott	dimholt	so how old is the motherboard on this computer?
2012-05-17T04:31:00.000Z	escott	dimholt	that would likely rule out uefi (unless its a mac)
2012-05-17T04:34:00.000Z	escott	dimholt	if the data on the disk can be trashed you could try a low level command to blow away the table. "dd bs=512 if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda count=1"
2012-05-17T04:35:00.000Z	escott	dimholt	make sure /dev/sda is the correct device first
2012-05-17T04:36:00.000Z	escott	dimholt	sda is probably the internal hard drive and sdb is the probably the usb boot disk
2012-05-17T04:37:00.000Z	escott	dimholt	are you removing the usb stick before trying to reboot?
2012-05-17T04:38:00.000Z	dimholt	escott	no, it's there.
2012-05-17T04:38:00.000Z	escott	dimholt	when you say "boot disk" thats really confusing. the "boot disk" is whatever you boot from. it could be the internal hdd or the liveusb install device
2012-05-17T04:53:00.000Z	dimholt	escott	seems the bootable USB had been erased somehow. Maybe I did it myself accidentally =) Seems it's coming along now ^
