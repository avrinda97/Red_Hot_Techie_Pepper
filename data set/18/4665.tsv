2009-04-19T00:02:00.000Z	jmulloy		Could I use chroot somehow to give a user their own environment to admin (install software, etc.) without giving them powers over the real environment?  Just wondering if I am on the right track.
2009-04-19T00:03:00.000Z	poningru	jmulloy	look into virtual macines
2009-04-19T00:10:00.000Z	jmulloy	poningru	 Thank you for your response!  I am not sure how VMs would work in this particular situation but I think check into it.  I am hoping to make an environment where the user could login that appearred to be a local admin account but did not effect the environment I have configured.
2009-04-19T00:11:00.000Z	poningru	jmulloy	you can assign a vm for each person
2009-04-19T00:12:00.000Z	poningru	jmulloy	you can also create chroot systems which are essentially same but are a lot more complicated from the system admins side i.e you
2009-04-19T00:15:00.000Z	jmulloy	poningru	Thank you!  I will try to wrap my head around a vm solution.
2009-04-19T00:18:00.000Z	poningru	jmulloy	you can setup a virtual machine system like virtualbox or kvm w/qemu and just bridge them all together

2009-04-19T00:18:00.000Z	poningru		lol
2009-04-19T00:22:00.000Z	poningru	jmulloy	how do you mean?
2009-04-19T00:22:00.000Z	poningru		dont want the user to not realize something has changed?
2009-04-19T00:22:00.000Z	poningru		oh!
2009-04-19T00:22:00.000Z	poningru		you mean keep their ~ folder the same?
2009-04-19T00:24:00.000Z	poningru		#winehq
2009-04-19T00:25:00.000Z	poningru	jmulloy	oh then you can just give them just permission to install software
2009-04-19T00:28:00.000Z	poningru	jmulloy	no linux does have that ability to just give them that permission
2009-04-19T00:29:00.000Z	poningru	jmulloy	to just install software or to give the ability to do everything but change network settings
2009-04-19T00:29:00.000Z	jmulloy	poningru	sorry ... not used to irc ... ok will look into it more.
