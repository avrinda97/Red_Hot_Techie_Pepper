2007-03-29T10:55:00.000Z	nesan		Yeah, it's text-only. Trying to think of a GTK/QT front-end you could use.
2007-03-29T10:56:00.000Z	nesan		There are a lot of front-ends to it, just trying to think of a general-purpose one for transcodes. Most are geared for DVD ripping and * --> MP4 as of late.
2007-03-29T10:58:00.000Z	nesan		Wish I had a .swf file on hand to see if Avidemux will accept it or not. Only video editor I have on-hand.
