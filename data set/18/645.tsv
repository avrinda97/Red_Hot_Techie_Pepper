2011-11-13T09:01:00.000Z	Yerushalmi		Every so often, usually when something tries to play a sound, the sound icon disappears from my upper bar, then reappears at full volume - even if sound was previously muted. If I'm trying to prevent popup windows from making "bonk" noises when I'm in class this is extremely inconvenient and irritating. Can someone help me figure out why this is happening and stop it?
2011-11-13T09:02:00.000Z	brjannc	Yerushalmi	can you make it happen right now, if you wanted to? hard to debug intermittent problems :\
2011-11-13T09:22:00.000Z	Yerushalmi	brjannc	Sorry, I didn't notice that you'd answered, another window took my attention. For the most part I can get it to happen pretty reliably. It usually happens whenever I don't have anything using sound, and then I type, say, backspace in KildClient, which gives me a can't-do-this beep. It also happens often when I start playing a youtube video.
2011-11-13T09:25:00.000Z	brjannc	Yerushalmi	no worries. my advice would be to open a terminal window and $ tail -f /var/log/messages, then try and reproduce the problem and see if anything's logging a crash
2011-11-13T09:31:00.000Z	Yerushalmi	brjannc	tail -f /var/log/messages gave me No such file or directory.
2011-11-13T09:32:00.000Z	brjannc	Yerushalmi	blerg, I always get confused with all the distros log file idiosyncrasies
2011-11-13T09:33:00.000Z	brjannc	Yerushalmi	Try tail -f /var/log/syslog, sorry
2011-11-13T09:34:00.000Z	Yerushalmi	brjannc	Okay, I'll try to get it to happen now.
2011-11-13T09:39:00.000Z	brjannc	Yerushalmi	K. you're looking for anything that has to do with sound, gstreamer, segmentation faults, backtraces, lib<anything>.so, ... basically, any sort of hint as to where to go next
2011-11-13T09:40:00.000Z	Yerushalmi	brjannc	I'm trying to get it to happen. Isn't it typical that when you actually want it to, it doesn't?
2011-11-13T09:40:00.000Z	brjannc	Yerushalmi	Yes. That's called brjannc's law.
2011-11-13T09:40:00.000Z	Yerushalmi	brjannc	LOL
2011-11-13T09:41:00.000Z	brjannc	Yerushalmi	(though i'm sure it predates me by hundreds of years :) )
2011-11-13T09:41:00.000Z	Yerushalmi	brjannc	Sec, I'll close mozilla. BBIAB.
2011-11-13T09:49:00.000Z	brjannc	Yerushalmi	rehi
2011-11-13T09:50:00.000Z	Yerushalmi	brjannc	Thanks :) So I can't get it to do it again. Grumblegrumble. I bet it'll wait to do it again when I'm in class.
2011-11-13T09:50:00.000Z	Yerushalmi	brjannc	Thanks for trying, anyways :)
2011-11-13T09:51:00.000Z	brjannc	Yerushalmi	no problem. one thing you can do is, next time it happens, just write down the exact time it happens, and come back here armed with that. Then I or someone else can help you look through your logs
