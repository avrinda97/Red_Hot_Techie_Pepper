2008-01-26T02:15:00.000Z	mikebot		Does anyone know why when I put my computer into hibernation, every time I turn it back on it doesn't act like it's coming out of hibernation, but instead just reboots?
2008-01-26T02:16:00.000Z	mikebot		!hibernate
2008-01-26T02:16:00.000Z	hnaz	mikebot	could you make `dmesg` output available?
2008-01-26T02:16:00.000Z	mikebot	hnaz	How do I do that?
2008-01-26T02:16:00.000Z	hnaz	mikebot	by entering dmesg > dmesg.txt and putting dmesg.txt somewhere on a pastebin or similar
2008-01-26T02:17:00.000Z	mikebot	hnaz	OK, one moment please.

2008-01-26T02:20:00.000Z	hnaz	mikebot	the kernel's ringbuffer is already eaten up by iptables output as it seems
2008-01-26T02:20:00.000Z	hnaz	mikebot	capture the dmesg output immediately after the misbehaved reboot
2008-01-26T02:25:00.000Z	mikebot	hnaz	You know what, when I just did it it worked.
2008-01-26T02:26:00.000Z	mikebot	hnaz	It seems this only happens when my cpmputer is in hibernation for extended periods (like 10 mins or more).
2008-01-26T02:27:00.000Z	mikebot	hnaz	I'm unsure if you are reading this or if I am stiill muted..
2008-01-26T05:29:00.000Z	hnaz	mikebot	top might help you here
2008-01-26T05:30:00.000Z	mikebot	hnaz	top?
2008-01-26T05:30:00.000Z	hnaz	mikebot	open top in a terminal, press F for sorting mode and then n for sort-by-memory-usage
2008-01-26T05:31:00.000Z	mikebot	hnaz	OK, I got that.
2008-01-26T05:31:00.000Z	mikebot	hnaz	But I cannot read it unfortunately.
2008-01-26T05:31:00.000Z	hnaz	mikebot	ah, yes.  system monitor is probably more gnome integrated :-)
