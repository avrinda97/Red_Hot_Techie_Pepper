2009-02-17T07:41:00.000Z	nightrid3r	zeke_	doe's your thumbdrive have a writeprotec switch (some do)
2009-02-17T07:43:00.000Z	zeke_	nightrid3r	no there is no switch
2009-02-17T07:43:00.000Z	nightrid3r	zeke_	then i'm out of ideas
2009-02-17T07:49:00.000Z	nightrid3r	zeke_	check /media
2009-02-17T07:50:00.000Z	zeke_	nightrid3r	 nope just cdrom0 and what i guess is a symbolic link to cdrom
2009-02-17T07:50:00.000Z	nightrid3r	zeke_	weird
2009-02-17T07:50:00.000Z	zeke_	nightrid3r	 i know this whole thing is weird
2009-02-17T07:51:00.000Z	zeke_	nightrid3r	 i tried another thumb drive and i get the same thing
2009-02-17T07:52:00.000Z	nightrid3r	zeke_	could be a HAL problem
2009-02-17T07:52:00.000Z	zeke_	nightrid3r	 HAL? thats not a 2001 joke is it?
2009-02-17T07:53:00.000Z	nightrid3r	zeke_	Hardware Abstraction Layer
2009-02-17T07:53:00.000Z	zeke_	nightrid3r	could it be caused by a program i installed? i installed realplayer yesterday, turns out i don't even need it
2009-02-17T07:54:00.000Z	nightrid3r	zeke_	no, hal if low level stuff
2009-02-17T07:55:00.000Z	zeke_	nightrid3r	what would cause HAL problems, my thumbdrives worked fine a few days ago, they would autmount, and an icon would appear on the desktop, and i could use the fle browser to view its contents
2009-02-17T07:56:00.000Z	nightrid3r	zeke_	kernel update could do that but i have no problems and update my laptop today
2009-02-17T07:58:00.000Z	zeke_	nightrid3r	 yeah i updated too. and i'm on a laptop if it matters
2009-02-17T07:58:00.000Z	nightrid3r	zeke_	running out of ideas
