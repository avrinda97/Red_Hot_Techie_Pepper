2007-04-22T10:56:00.000Z	xtknight		why does nothing tab complete when i prefix it with sudo?
2007-04-22T10:56:00.000Z	xtknight		no commands tabcomplete but filenames do when using 'sudo'
2007-04-22T10:57:00.000Z	bofh80	xtknight	works for me
2007-04-22T10:58:00.000Z	xtknight	bofh80	interesting
2007-04-22T10:58:00.000Z	xtknight	bofh80	you can type sudo grub-i and it will say grub-install?
2007-04-22T10:58:00.000Z	bofh80	xtknight	yup, works...
2007-04-22T10:59:00.000Z	bofh80	xtknight	log on a TTY as root and see if it autocompletes commands as root ?
2007-04-22T11:00:00.000Z	xtknight	bofh80	yea it works under "sudo i" # shell
2007-04-22T11:00:00.000Z	bofh80	xtknight	i ended up using that, cos all the other bittorrent clients for linux are , well, cough . . . .
2007-04-22T11:13:00.000Z	bofh80	xtknight	should he be using nvidia-glx or nvidia-glx-new ? i think the latter? will the restricted manager have installed the correct one?
2007-04-22T11:13:00.000Z	xtknight	bofh80	restricted seems to always install -glx i think.  im not sure honesly
2007-04-22T11:13:00.000Z	xtknight	bofh80	good point though
2007-04-22T11:14:00.000Z	bofh80	xtknight	i didn't know i could do that :D
2007-04-22T11:18:00.000Z	bofh80	xtknight	cos of the rush redevelopment when nvidia rehashed the drivers just prior to release day lol
2007-04-22T11:20:00.000Z	bofh80	xtknight	ahh the old -phigh , never ever bloody worked for me. bloody thing . . :)
