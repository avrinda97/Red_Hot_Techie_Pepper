2007-01-07T07:38:00.000Z	mvfeinstein		 Hi can anyone in here help me, I have an ATI x850 and just installed xorg-driver-fglx and now when i run glxinfo it says that direct render is off. How can I turn it back on?
2007-01-07T07:40:00.000Z	mvfeinstein		petal fglrx is in there
2007-01-07T07:40:00.000Z	mooey	mvfeinstein	is fglrx the driver in your /etc/X11/xorg.conf?
2007-01-07T07:41:00.000Z	mvfeinstein	mooey	yes
2007-01-07T07:41:00.000Z	mooey	mvfeinstein	anything on in your xorg log in /var/log?
2007-01-07T07:44:00.000Z	mvfeinstein	mooey	there is a lot anything i am looking for?
2007-01-07T07:45:00.000Z	mooey	mvfeinstein	something that starts EE and looks relevant i guess, you could pastebin the log?
2007-01-07T07:49:00.000Z	mvfeinstein	mooey	Here is the log http://pastebin.com/853201
2007-01-07T07:52:00.000Z	mooey	mvfeinstein	wierd. no errors. still glxinfo says direct rendering: no ?
2007-01-07T07:53:00.000Z	mvfeinstein	mooey	the only error I saw was about aiglx. Direct render still says no and I just noticed this Xlib:  extension "XFree86-DRI" missing on display ":0.0".
2007-01-07T07:54:00.000Z	mooey	mvfeinstein	i've had that before. there was a solution burried in the forums. i think it had todo with having the right settings in xorg.conf as petal was saying.
2007-01-07T08:05:00.000Z	mooey	mvfeinstein	theres some good guides for ati on the ubuntu forums, and for beryl on the beryl forums
2007-01-07T08:05:00.000Z	mvfeinstein	mooey	is there any all inclusive that is easy to follow? I went through a lot of them and it really screw up my display last night
2007-01-07T08:06:00.000Z	mooey	mvfeinstein	its a sod :( the one on the wiki should be good
2007-01-07T08:07:00.000Z	mooey	mvfeinstein	i found it easier to install the drivers from ati.com than the ubuntu packaged ones. there is also a repository which has easy install and up to date ati drivers but i dont remember its name, sorry
2007-01-07T08:46:00.000Z	mooey	mvfeinstein	do you have 3d acceleration going?
2007-01-07T08:48:00.000Z	mvfeinstein	mooey	yes
2007-01-07T08:48:00.000Z	mvfeinstein	mooey	ok :)
