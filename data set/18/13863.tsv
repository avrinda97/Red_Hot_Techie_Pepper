2006-09-04T05:10:00.000Z	Shuvelhasser		Nozorro: It's a hard disk, it's device is /dev/sda, and the speed is unavailable
2006-09-04T05:10:00.000Z	Shuvelhasser		Nozorro: ok, done.
2006-09-04T05:11:00.000Z	Shuvelhasser		Varsendaggr: Yes
2006-09-04T05:11:00.000Z	Shuvelhasser		Nozorro: Ubuntu and other info are in diff partitions
2006-09-04T05:12:00.000Z	Shuvelhasser		Noz/Var: The info from windows is in the NTFS partition, that's the stuff I want to read.
2006-09-04T05:13:00.000Z	Shuvelhasser		Nozorro: 1 is NTFS, 2 is ubuntu
2006-09-04T05:15:00.000Z	Shuvelhasser		Nozorro: mount: /dev/sda already mounted or /mnt busy
2006-09-04T05:17:00.000Z	Shuvelhasser		heh, got a new error
2006-09-04T05:17:00.000Z	Shuvelhasser		mount: according to mtab, /dev/sda1 is mounted on /tmp/disks-conf-sda1
2006-09-04T05:18:00.000Z	Shuvelhasser		opened
2006-09-04T05:18:00.000Z	liquidten2	Shuvelhasser	what does, "ls /tmn/disks-conf-sda1" say?  Also, does /etc/mtab mention it?  It may actually be mounted
2006-09-04T05:19:00.000Z	liquidten2	Shuvelhasser	how about "sudo ls /tmn/disks-conf-sda1"?
2006-09-04T05:20:00.000Z	liquidten2	Shuvelhasser	*** how about "sudo ls /tmp/disks-conf-sda1"?  Same typo AGAIN
2006-09-04T05:23:00.000Z	liquidten2	Shuvelhasser	I'm not sure, I wasn't here to see what your original question was >_>
2006-09-04T05:25:00.000Z	liquidten2	Shuvelhasser	type the command "sudo /usr/bin/nautilus /tmp/disks-conf-sda1"
2006-09-04T06:02:00.000Z	liquidten2	Shuvelhasser	that means that /etc/apt/sources.list contains a line that has the word "sudo" in it, which shouldn't be there.  Edit your /etc/apt/sources.list and delete Sudo out of line 34.
2006-09-04T06:04:00.000Z	liquidten2	Shuvelhasser	"nano /etc/apt/sources.list"  then from there go to line 34, delete sudo, press control+x, choose yes to save, then run apt-get update.
2006-09-04T06:04:00.000Z	liquidten2	Shuvelhasser	or rather SUDO nano /etc/apt/sources.list  (i am not an ubuntu user <_<)
