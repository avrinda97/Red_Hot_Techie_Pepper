2006-01-13T06:49:00.000Z	tafsen		If I play music from rhythmbox, I can't get sound from any other program. Why is that, and how can I fix it?
2006-01-13T06:50:00.000Z	tafsen		can anyone please help me with my sound problem?
2006-01-13T06:51:00.000Z	Korupt	tafsen	what's up?
2006-01-13T06:52:00.000Z	tafsen	Korupt	I can't play sound from more than one sound source at the time =\
2006-01-13T06:53:00.000Z	Korupt	tafsen	what type of sound card?
2006-01-13T06:53:00.000Z	tafsen	Korupt	dunno. How do I check?
2006-01-13T06:54:00.000Z	Korupt	tafsen	System => Administration => Device Manager
2006-01-13T06:54:00.000Z	tafsen	Korupt	ok, I check it out
2006-01-13T06:58:00.000Z	tafsen	Korupt	Intel 82801DB-ICH4 ALSA Capture device?
2006-01-13T06:58:00.000Z	Korupt	tafsen	okay.... now what you do is google for linux kernel support of your card...... the kernel may only support a single channel
2006-01-13T06:59:00.000Z	tafsen	Korupt	Like "Intel 82801DB-ICHA kernel support" ?
2006-01-13T07:00:00.000Z	Korupt	tafsen	yeah
2006-01-13T07:00:00.000Z	Korupt	tafsen	more often than not on more obscure devices like yours there is minimal support if any
2006-01-13T07:02:00.000Z	tafsen	Korupt	well I get sound at least.  Can i compile anything to the kernel if it doesn't support it?
2006-01-13T07:03:00.000Z	Korupt	tafsen	once in a great while yes, though you'd have to research that...... Seveas would be the one to ask there
2006-01-13T07:05:00.000Z	tafsen	Korupt	about kernel compiling?
2006-01-13T07:06:00.000Z	Korupt	tafsen	about tracking down a kernel module..... I tend to spend hours looking for those sort of things and never find it
2006-01-13T07:06:00.000Z	tafsen	Korupt	hehe. Ok ;) thx for the help
