2006-06-04T08:15:00.000Z	centipeed		Ok, found out my monitor's refresh rate is 75hz
2006-06-04T08:15:00.000Z	centipeed		How would I put that in?
2006-06-04T08:16:00.000Z	nuzzy	centipeed	 just joined the chat, but if you'er looking to edit xorg.conf you could do it as 1280x1024_75
2006-06-04T08:16:00.000Z	centipeed	nuzzy	What is that and what will it do?
2006-06-04T08:17:00.000Z	centipeed	nuzzy	I got a Out Of Range error with my monitor
2006-06-04T08:17:00.000Z	nuzzy	centipeed	 what was your original question so I can answer fully for you
2006-06-04T08:17:00.000Z	centipeed	nuzzy	Although it was working fine, it just happened suddenly
2006-06-04T08:17:00.000Z	centipeed	nuzzy	I was using Ubuntu, I switch to some other program on the taskbar, and suddenly my monitor goes off, and shows "Out Of Range"
2006-06-04T08:18:00.000Z	centipeed	nuzzy	Strange, because it's working now and was working for about 5 minutes before that error
2006-06-04T08:18:00.000Z	centipeed	nuzzy	I just wanted to make sure it didn't happen again
2006-06-04T08:18:00.000Z	centipeed	nuzzy	Although right now I've got it at 1024x768
2006-06-04T08:19:00.000Z	centipeed	nuzzy	I put it down a res because I thought that running at 1280x1024 was the problem
2006-06-04T08:22:00.000Z	centipeed	nuzzy	You want just the monitor section?
2006-06-04T08:22:00.000Z	centipeed	nuzzy	And how do I save xorg.conf?
2006-06-04T08:22:00.000Z	centipeed	nuzzy	Save changes I mean
2006-06-04T08:25:00.000Z	centipeed	nuzzy	Now, I know about putting in the values for refresh rates and such
2006-06-04T08:25:00.000Z	centipeed	nuzzy	Was there any special reason you wanted me to post xorg.conf?
2006-06-04T08:28:00.000Z	centipeed	nuzzy	It could be that I don't need to put this stuff in and it was a one off error. It's just that I wanted to make sure it didn't happen again you see
