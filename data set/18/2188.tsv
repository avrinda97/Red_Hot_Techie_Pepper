2011-05-06T18:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cutiyar_	 ask the channel. not me speficically. I dont do wireless. I think the lspci command shows  the cards.

2011-05-06T18:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cutiyar_	  Be more clear in what you are saying to the channel also.. You mean its not shown by 'lspci' or what excactluy/

2011-05-06T18:24:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cutiyar_	 some broadcom cards are problematic. I seem to recall seeing that # card mentioned in here a lot.
2011-05-06T18:24:00.000Z	cutiyar_	Dr_Willis	what i have to do?
2011-05-06T18:24:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	cutiyar_	 no idea. I would check the forums and the 'askubuntu' web site  and search for that specific chipset 'bcm4312 LP-PHY'
