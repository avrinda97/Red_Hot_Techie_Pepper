2010-09-17T06:21:00.000Z	dejavou42	arrrghhh	If I'm not mistaken samba uses the usernames and passwords from the host computer to authenticate
2010-09-17T06:21:00.000Z	arrrghhh	dejavou42	but why would my laptop sometimes ask for a password, but on my gf's it never asks?  i've even tried "saving" it on my laptop, no luck.
2010-09-17T06:22:00.000Z	dejavou42	arrrghhh	You should be able to check something like "remember this password" on the client machines. This is probably why some of the computers being asked for credentials
2010-09-17T06:22:00.000Z	arrrghhh	dejavou42	i tried that...
2010-09-17T06:24:00.000Z	dejavou42	arrrghhh	hmm check your samba settings system --> administration--> samba. Then go to preferences --> server settings
2010-09-17T06:25:00.000Z	arrrghhh	dejavou42	ah.  it's a server.  i have webmin to configure samba, or the conf file :D
2010-09-17T06:25:00.000Z	dejavou42	arrrghhh	are you allowing a guest account? what is the authentication mode?
2010-09-17T06:25:00.000Z	arrrghhh	dejavou42	yes i believe i have the guest account enabled.
2010-09-17T06:26:00.000Z	dejavou42	arrrghhh	that could be why it prompts sometimes and other times doesn't. Try turning that off and it should prompt all the time.
2010-09-17T06:27:00.000Z	arrrghhh	dejavou42	lol what if i never want it to prompt... i'd prefer no password authentication.  i know, not secure... but it's only on my lan.
2010-09-17T06:29:00.000Z	dejavou42	arrrghhh	Not really sure, I haven't dug into samba that far, but My guess would be to try domain.
2010-09-17T06:29:00.000Z	dejavou42	arrrghhh	As long as all of your computers are on the same domain, it should authenticate
2010-09-17T06:30:00.000Z	arrrghhh	dejavou42	hrm.  is that supported in samba v3?  i know they're making a lot of big promises for v4... but last i tried it wasn't nearly production-ready.
2010-09-17T06:30:00.000Z	dejavou42	arrrghhh	don't know about the webmin interface, but it sure is an option on my box. 10.04
2010-09-17T06:31:00.000Z	arrrghhh	dejavou42	do you know what version of samba you're running?  if you didn't do any mucking with your repo's i'd assume v3...
2010-09-17T06:33:00.000Z	dejavou42	arrrghhh	3.4.7
2010-09-17T06:34:00.000Z	arrrghhh	dejavou42	hrm.  alrighty, i'll pokie around.  thanks!
