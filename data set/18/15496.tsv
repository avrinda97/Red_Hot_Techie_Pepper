2006-06-29T11:41:00.000Z	cwillu	will_	there's things like gnome (ubuntu default), kde (kubuntu), windowmaker (xubuntu), and a few hundred others
2006-06-29T11:41:00.000Z	cwillu	will_	they all have various ways of skinning (or lack thereof, for performence, etc)
2006-06-29T12:05:00.000Z	cwillu	will_	 most apps should make shortcuts automatically in the menus (which you should be able to drag to the desktop)
2006-06-29T12:06:00.000Z	cwillu	will_	those that don't, you need to figure out how to launch them from the terminal (the name of the app is usually a good start), and then make a new menu entry using that command
2006-06-29T12:06:00.000Z	cwillu	will_	alacarte will help you do that (menu editor)
2006-06-29T12:07:00.000Z	cwillu	will_	launch synaptic, and search for it
2006-06-29T12:08:00.000Z	cwillu	will_	package manager, in system | adnub
2006-06-29T12:26:00.000Z	cwillu	will_	the update-manager should stay on top of keeping everything up to date for the most part
