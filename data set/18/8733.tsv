2007-07-14T10:39:00.000Z	neonimr		how can i install ubuntu from an iso file without burning a cd
2007-07-14T10:39:00.000Z	neonimr		?
2007-07-14T10:38:00.000Z	neonimr		i installed kubuntu from the alternate cd ,and it never asked me to setup a passowrd,but now when i try to loging to it of course it is asking for a username/password
2007-07-14T10:40:00.000Z	sdouble	neonimr	it asks you for a password when you install
2007-07-14T10:40:00.000Z	neonimr	sdouble	it never did
2007-07-14T10:40:00.000Z	sdouble		did for me, I just installed it twice last night
2007-07-14T10:40:00.000Z	neonimr	sdouble	i used the alternate cd as an iso on my hard drive when i was installing it
2007-07-14T10:41:00.000Z	sdouble		asks for your user name, user's name, password, confirm password
2007-07-14T10:41:00.000Z	sdouble		mine was not an iso, but I use the alternate cd for everything
2007-07-14T10:42:00.000Z	neonimr		it is really confusing
2007-07-14T10:42:00.000Z	neonimr		i cant get into the system i installed
2007-07-14T10:42:00.000Z	sdouble	neonimr	it also asks for your host name in the same few steps.
2007-07-14T10:43:00.000Z	neonimr	sdouble	i never did
2007-07-14T10:43:00.000Z	neonimr	sdouble	it never did
2007-07-14T10:43:00.000Z	sdouble	neonimr	odd, sounds like you should reinstall it.  Because it WILL ask you those questions I just said.  If it did not, there may have been some problem during the install
2007-07-14T10:44:00.000Z	neonimr	sdouble	what i do is boat from a flash drive
2007-07-14T10:44:00.000Z	neonimr		and let search for an kubuntu.iso that i have on my hd
2007-07-14T10:45:00.000Z	sdouble	neonimr	regardless.  If you install from an iso that is downloaded from ubuntu, it will go through the exact process
