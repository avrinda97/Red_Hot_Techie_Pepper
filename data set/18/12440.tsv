2007-04-08T07:24:00.000Z	swedekid		I just downloaded Ubuntu, and whenever i start up mycomputer, it comes up with a bunch of text, then the final line says "[DR-DOS]  A:\>" then it wants me to type something, what do i do?
2007-04-08T07:26:00.000Z	swedekid		can anyone help me?
2007-04-08T07:27:00.000Z	lufis	swedekid	just ask your question :)
2007-04-08T07:28:00.000Z	lufis	swedekid	are you booting from the cd?
2007-04-08T07:29:00.000Z	lufis	swedekid	go into your bios and make sure booting from cd is first in the sequence
2007-04-08T07:29:00.000Z	lufis	swedekid	well, type "help" in the dos prompt and see if you can boot from cd from within it
2007-04-08T07:35:00.000Z	lufis	swedekid	A friend of mine had the same problem. I can't remember what he did but he got it to work eventually
2007-04-08T07:35:00.000Z	lufis	swedekid	I don't think it's an issue with the disk
2007-04-08T07:36:00.000Z	lufis	swedekid	you probably have a dos os flashed into your bios or something
2007-04-08T07:37:00.000Z	lufis	swedekid	play around with your bios i guess?
2007-04-08T07:38:00.000Z	lufis	swedekid	try googling "dr dos bios" or something
2007-04-08T07:39:00.000Z	lufis	swedekid	if you don't have a floppy and it's not booting from the hd it's probably the vendor's bios doing it
2007-04-08T07:39:00.000Z	lufis	swedekid	yeah, the bios the mobo manufacturer loaded
2007-04-08T07:40:00.000Z	lufis	swedekid	did you try typing "help" at the dos prompt?
2007-04-08T07:40:00.000Z	lufis	swedekid	what'd it output?
2007-04-08T07:40:00.000Z	lufis	swedekid	anything related to booting?
2007-04-08T07:41:00.000Z	lufis	swedekid	hm, strange. i don't know, my friend isn't online right now to ask what he did, but he had the same "dr dos" thing
