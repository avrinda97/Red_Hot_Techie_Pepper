2006-10-21T15:11:00.000Z	Yourname	anon32	What about a .tgz? kitche just said I could :S
2006-10-21T15:12:00.000Z	anon32	Yourname	err... for tgz isn't a package format, the tool you need depends on the compressed files
2006-10-21T15:13:00.000Z	Yourname	anon32	I just got alien to make a .deb file from the .tgz
2006-10-21T15:13:00.000Z	anon32	Yourname	ok, fine, be that way
2006-10-21T15:13:00.000Z	Yourname	anon32	hehe :P
2006-10-21T15:18:00.000Z	anon32	Yourname	yep, the edgy iso
2006-10-21T15:22:00.000Z	Yourname	anon32	Also, I just installed network managers.. now I don't see it anywhere?
2006-10-21T15:23:00.000Z	anon32	Yourname	if you aliened it, it probably won't auto-configure, search for the actual file and execute it
2006-10-21T15:23:00.000Z	Yourname	anon32	Ok, and where do you think it is? :S
2006-10-21T15:24:00.000Z	anon32	Yourname	/usr/bin
2006-10-21T15:25:00.000Z	Yourname	anon32	Found it. As 'nm' and when I try to exec it, it says a.out, no such file. :(
2006-10-21T15:26:00.000Z	anon32	Yourname	that's the problem with using alien, sometimes it doesn't work
2006-10-21T15:26:00.000Z	Yourname	anon32	any alternative suggestions, please? I now have a .tgz and a .deb of the network manager.
2006-10-21T15:27:00.000Z	anon32	Yourname	open the .tgz and read the README
2006-10-22T11:17:00.000Z	anon32	Yourname	add it to a boot script?
2006-10-22T11:17:00.000Z	Yourname	anon32	So, that command.. it's temporary, right?
2006-10-22T11:18:00.000Z	anon32	Yourname	I don't know, the way you said it, it made me assume it was
