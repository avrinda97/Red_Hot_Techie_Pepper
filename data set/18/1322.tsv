2011-05-10T09:47:00.000Z	Guy-Incognito		ahoy, just tried installing 11.04 64 and 32-bit for the first time, same issue...  bootloader installation failure... afterward unable to "continue without installing bootloader" or any other option, "OK" button does nothing... anyone seen this?
2011-05-10T09:48:00.000Z	KM0201	Guy-Incognito	i would try setting up your partitions manually, and specifically telling the bootloader where to go
2011-05-10T09:48:00.000Z	Guy-Incognito	KM0201	i'll give that another shot
2011-05-10T09:48:00.000Z	KM0201	Guy-Incognito	did you already try that?
2011-05-10T09:53:00.000Z	Guy-Incognito	KM0201	Yes, and I'm surprised that the dialog box does nothing when I hit OK after the error.  I had planned on finishing the install without Grub2 and just installing it later from a Live CD.  I'll try manually configuring partitions again though.
2011-05-10T09:54:00.000Z	KM0201	Guy-Incognito	when you did it manually, where did you try to put grub?
2011-05-10T09:58:00.000Z	Guy-Incognito	KM0201	/dev/sda
2011-05-10T09:59:00.000Z	KM0201	Guy-Incognito	i know this will sound retarded, but /dev/sda is your internal hard drive, right?.. i've saw some instances, where /sda gets detected as a uSB
2011-05-10T10:02:00.000Z	Guy-Incognito	KM0201	yeah, and I get the same bootloader install failure error whether I use a single non-RAID drive or whether I have 2 in a RAID 0 stripe
2011-05-10T10:15:00.000Z	Guy-Incognito	KM0201	The exact error is "Executing 'grub-install /dev/sda' failed.
2011-05-10T10:16:00.000Z	KM0201	Guy-Incognito	hmm, does the install complete other wise, and if so, can you install grub from the live cd
2011-05-10T10:17:00.000Z	Guy-Incognito	KM0201	 The install does not complete.  It completely stalls when the bootloader fails to install.  The option to continue w/out installing bootloader is there, but the OK button does nothing.  I have to reboot at that point.
2011-05-10T10:18:00.000Z	KM0201	Guy-Incognito	hmm, that is weird.
2011-05-10T10:18:00.000Z	KM0201	Guy-Incognito	my uess is, your system is completely installed, because the bootloader is the last thing to get installed.
2011-05-10T10:18:00.000Z	KM0201	Guy-Incognito	i would try reinstalling grub, from the live cd.
2011-05-10T10:19:00.000Z	KM0201	Guy-Incognito	i would try following the "restore grub" instructions in that link above
2011-05-10T11:05:00.000Z	Guy-Incognito	KM0201	I think I tracked down the issue.  It's an issue w/ my MBR due to FlexNet...stupid Adobe...  Thanks for the help.
2011-05-10T11:06:00.000Z	KM0201	Guy-Incognito	no prob... good luck w/ it...
