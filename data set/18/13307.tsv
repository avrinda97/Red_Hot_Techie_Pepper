2006-03-13T16:47:00.000Z	bigfoot1		i can view japanese website okay, but i can't view a japanese pdf. help
2006-03-13T16:49:00.000Z	dli	bigfoot1	acroread-asianfonts or something like that
2006-03-13T16:51:00.000Z	bigfoot1	dli	thanks
2006-03-13T16:51:00.000Z	bigfoot1	dli	 how do i search for the correct name?
2006-03-13T16:51:00.000Z	dli	bigfoot1	in synaptic or apt-cache search asian
2006-03-13T16:52:00.000Z	bigfoot1	dli	i found xfonts-intl-asian - International fonts for X -- Asian
2006-03-13T16:52:00.000Z	bigfoot1	dli	but nothing with "acro"
2006-03-13T16:53:00.000Z	dli	bigfoot1	can you install acroread first?
2006-03-13T16:53:00.000Z	bigfoot1	dli	 i have xpdf and gnome-viewer. is acroread necessary to view asian fontst?
2006-03-13T16:53:00.000Z	dli	bigfoot1	or try to search "cjk", sorry, I'm not running ubuntu, couldn't do the search here
2006-03-13T16:54:00.000Z	dli	bigfoot1	acroread comes with better fonts, and X can use those fonts
2006-03-13T16:55:00.000Z	bigfoot1	dli	okay, i 'll just get acroread
2006-03-13T16:56:00.000Z	dli	bigfoot1	other packages with acroread? like recommended for acroread from apt or just search
2006-03-13T17:00:00.000Z	bigfoot1	dli	 i tried opening the japanees pdf in acroread. it says "japanese language support pack is necessary." where do i get it?
2006-03-13T17:06:00.000Z	bigfoot1	dli	i got japanese pdf working now
2006-03-13T17:06:00.000Z	bigfoot1	dli	 i just had to install xpdf-japanese
2006-03-13T17:08:00.000Z	bigfoot1	dli	after i got xpdf working with Japnaenes, i didn't bother looking for acroread-japanese. do you prefer acroread? is it better than xpdf or gnome pdf viewer?
2006-03-13T17:09:00.000Z	dli	bigfoot1	no, you want the fonts from acroread
