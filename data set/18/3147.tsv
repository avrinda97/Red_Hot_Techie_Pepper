2009-11-30T12:31:00.000Z	maco	visitor1	there may be a PPA somewhere...

2009-11-30T12:32:00.000Z	maco	visitor1	from where?
2009-11-30T12:32:00.000Z	visitor1	maco	Quelle: http://ppa.launchpad.net/popey/inkscape/ubuntu/pool/main/i/inkscape/inkscape_0.47-0ubuntu1_i386.deb
2009-11-30T12:33:00.000Z	maco	visitor1	add the ppa instead of downloading the deb on its own, that way apt can install the dependencies for you
2009-11-30T12:37:00.000Z	visitor1	maco	i just have to add the ppa website to synaptic packet management?
2009-11-30T12:38:00.000Z	maco	visitor1	yeah it gives you the line to add i a little box on there
2009-11-30T12:48:00.000Z	visitor1	maco	i am stupid i cant find the right line to add to synaptic?
2009-11-30T12:49:00.000Z	maco	visitor1	see where it says "You can update your system with unsupported packages from this untrusted PPA by adding ppa:popey/inkscape  to your system's Software Sources." ?
