2006-08-24T06:27:00.000Z	Don_jr		I'm back and having trouble with installing Ubuntu
2006-08-24T06:28:00.000Z	Don_jr		I clicked on the install button while in live CD mode, window popped up saying 'install' in the header, window is blank other than that and the disk has stopped responding.
2006-08-24T06:30:00.000Z	Madpilot	Don_jr	neither. Default format is ext3
2006-08-24T06:32:00.000Z	Madpilot	Don_jr	if you're installing Ubuntu, it will want to reformat a partition to ext3 (at least one partition)
2006-08-24T07:20:00.000Z	Madpilot	Don_jr	is this a CD you burned yourself, or a ShipIt one?
2006-08-24T07:21:00.000Z	Madpilot	Don_jr	did you run md5sum on the ISO before you burned it?
2006-08-24T07:57:00.000Z	Madpilot	Don_jr	routers shouldn't care what's connecting to them...
2006-08-24T08:09:00.000Z	Madpilot	Don_jr	you can run Apache easily on Ubuntu - it's a complex app, though
2006-08-24T08:10:00.000Z	Madpilot	Don_jr	there's 18000 packages in Ubuntu's repositories, no need to compile. Besides, you don't need to know programming to compile, actually.
2006-08-24T08:12:00.000Z	Madpilot	Don_jr	similar - see the PM that ubotu just sent you
2006-08-24T08:14:00.000Z	Madpilot	Don_jr	small bash scripts can be helpful for stuff you do repeatedly, but really, you can use Ubuntu without learning anything beyond very basic command line stuff
2006-08-24T08:17:00.000Z	Madpilot	Don_jr	you could create a little script that starts both firefox & gaim when you run it, yeah
2006-08-24T08:24:00.000Z	Madpilot	Don_jr	not much, unless you break something ;)
2006-08-24T08:24:00.000Z	Madpilot	Don_jr	X is the desktop/graphical server
2006-08-24T08:25:00.000Z	Madpilot	Don_jr	"the X server" is the base of the whole graphical enviroment in Linux, more or less.
2006-08-24T08:28:00.000Z	Madpilot	Don_jr	more or less
2006-08-24T08:30:00.000Z	Madpilot	Don_jr	read/write/execute privs - basically, who is allowed to do what w/ the file
2006-08-24T08:35:00.000Z	Madpilot	Don_jr	the BasicCommands one? glad it works :)
