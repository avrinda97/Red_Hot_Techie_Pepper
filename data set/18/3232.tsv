2009-12-11T22:01:00.000Z	xckpd7		can anyone recommend/not recommend using IEs4Linux?
2009-12-11T22:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_	xckpd7	 its designed to just test out your html/sites to be sure they render proplery in IE. not for use for 'browsing'
2009-12-11T22:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_	xckpd7	 so what do you want to 'use' it for?
2009-12-11T22:02:00.000Z	xckpd7	Dr_Willis_	doing html/css
2009-12-11T22:02:00.000Z	xckpd7	Dr_Willis_	I was told to use a VM but I really don't want to if IEs4Linux is good (I was told it was unstable by someone but I want confirmation)
2009-12-11T22:02:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_	xckpd7	 then use it to 'verify' your stuff works in IE - or just use a spare machine that has windows...  your decision.
2009-12-11T22:03:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_	xckpd7	 or use a vm.  Thers even live-windows cd's you cold use in a vm. (not legal however)
2009-12-11T22:04:00.000Z	xckpd7	Dr_Willis_	Ok so the issue is, I have a VM now but I want to avoid using it (only if IEs4linux runs alright). I was told to stay away from IEs4Linux but I don't know if that is good advice/bad advice
2009-12-11T22:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_	xckpd7	 try it and see.. thats the Ultimate answer.
2009-12-11T22:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_	xckpd7	 sudo apt-get install wine         dont work?
2009-12-11T22:10:00.000Z	xckpd7	Dr_Willis_	thank you, kind of new at using this
2009-12-11T22:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_	xckpd7	 for the latest versions of wine. You may want to add the winehq repos.
2009-12-11T22:11:00.000Z	xckpd7	Dr_Willis_	it's already installing: should I cancel? what do you think?
2009-12-11T22:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_	xckpd7	 may as well use whats in the repos.
2009-12-11T22:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis_	xckpd7	 depending on what you are running in wine . You may want the latest.
