2010-09-01T04:29:00.000Z	mibber		http://pastebin.com/jcSe2r01 here is my error, can someone help?
2010-09-01T04:30:00.000Z	coz_	mibber	  try  sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop
2010-09-01T04:30:00.000Z	coz_	mibber	 then  sudo /etc/init.d/gdm start or   sudo restart gdm
2010-09-01T04:31:00.000Z	mibber	coz_	okay
2010-09-01T04:35:00.000Z	mibber	coz_	so i restarted it okay, i dn't see any errors in the console, but i still have my problem - i double click anything on the desktop, and nothing happens!
2010-09-01T04:36:00.000Z	coz_	mibber	 what were you doing  or installing or uninstalling just before all of this occurred??
2010-09-01T04:36:00.000Z	mibber	coz_	i haven't installed anything, i was writing some code, nothing that would really be similar as i can recall
2010-09-01T04:37:00.000Z	mibber	coz_	are there error logs or something?
2010-09-01T04:37:00.000Z	coz_	mibber	 mmm  this is puzzling then....  you can check under system administration for log files
2010-09-01T04:37:00.000Z	coz_	mibber	 although ...unless you actually ran the code you were creating ...this makes no sense
2010-09-01T04:38:00.000Z	mibber	coz_	yes it is weird, i don't know whats going on
2010-09-01T04:38:00.000Z	coz_	mibber	 is this a new install ?
2010-09-01T04:38:00.000Z	mibber	coz_	about a month old
2010-09-01T04:39:00.000Z	coz_	mibber	 ok you could create a new user account and see if everything works in that then remove the old account
2010-09-01T04:39:00.000Z	mibber	coz_	let me try that
2010-09-01T04:40:00.000Z	mibber	coz_	do i just make a new user in teh console, and then run gdm as that user?
2010-09-01T04:40:00.000Z	coz_	mibber	 yes if you know how to create a user via terminal that should be fine
2010-09-01T04:40:00.000Z	mibber	coz_	okay
