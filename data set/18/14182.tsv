2005-09-06T07:05:00.000Z	ubuntu-asker		hello, pls somebody can explain me the process of compile a kernel on ubuntu? is the same as other distros? download the source from kernel.org and make menuconfig?
2005-09-06T07:06:00.000Z	CarlFK	ubuntu-asker	- why do you want to compile a kernel?
2005-09-06T07:06:00.000Z	ubuntu-asker	CarlFK	the question must be... why i dont?
2005-09-06T07:06:00.000Z	CarlFK	ubuntu-asker	- because you don't need to
2005-09-06T07:07:00.000Z	ubuntu-asker	CarlFK	first, the kernel is full of modules (unnesesary), and second my sound doesnt work
2005-09-06T07:07:00.000Z	CarlFK	ubuntu-asker	- don't mess with the kernel for best resutls ;)
2005-09-06T07:07:00.000Z	ubuntu-asker	CarlFK	on the contrary... compile the kernel for BEST results
2005-09-06T07:08:00.000Z	CarlFK	ubuntu-asker	- depends on your idea of BEST.
2005-09-06T07:09:00.000Z	ubuntu-asker	CarlFK	are you saying that a "precompiled" kernel is BEST than the one i can compile???
2005-09-06T07:10:00.000Z	CarlFK	ubuntu-asker	- no.  I am saying your overall linux experianc will be best if you just use what works.  if you need to fix sound, fix sound, not "everything"
2005-09-06T07:11:00.000Z	CarlFK	ubuntu-asker	- if you want the kind of BEST you are looking for, become a kernel developer and make sure it it optimized for all the hardware you use.
2005-09-06T07:12:00.000Z	ubuntu-asker	CarlFK	i only want to know how can i do that on ubuntu without fear
2005-09-06T07:13:00.000Z	CarlFK	ubuntu-asker	- there is a package you can install that has the patched srouces
2005-09-06T07:14:00.000Z	ubuntu-asker	CarlFK	i have no problem to leave this kernel, but there is a lot of modules that i dont need and i have no sound
2005-09-06T07:16:00.000Z	ubuntu-asker	CarlFK	this system is for my bro so he can play games with cedega, so i only want a easy thing that just work (thats is why i installed ubuntu on his suystem)
2005-09-06T07:16:00.000Z	ubuntu-asker	CarlFK	so, how is the "normal" process to compile a kernel (or recompile the one im using right now)
2005-09-06T07:17:00.000Z	CarlFK	ubuntu-asker	- yeah, that.
