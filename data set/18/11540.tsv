2006-07-16T15:07:00.000Z	Kaervek		Can anybody continue to help me with my problem?  Ubuntu boot hangs when more than 1 harddrive installed.
2006-07-16T15:07:00.000Z	riddlebox	Kaervek	I have 2 hard drives on my setup and it worked fine
2006-07-16T15:08:00.000Z	Kaervek	riddlebox	Are you dual-booting?
2006-07-16T15:08:00.000Z	riddlebox	Kaervek	nope
2006-07-16T15:08:00.000Z	Kaervek	riddlebox	I am, and I'm thinking that might be having a negative effect on why it won't boot.  Maybe not.
2006-07-16T15:09:00.000Z	riddlebox	Kaervek	so you have ubuntu installed, its just not booting ubuntu, or both os's
2006-07-16T15:10:00.000Z	Kaervek	riddlebox	I have Ubuntu on a 20GB partition, WinXP MCE on a 50GB partition and a 4GB swap on my 74GB raptor.
2006-07-16T15:10:00.000Z	Kaervek	riddlebox	Well it boots when I remove my other harddrives from the board.
2006-07-16T15:11:00.000Z	Kaervek	riddlebox	when I instal the other drives (2x 160GB; 1 500GB) Ubuntu hangs at "Waiting for root filesystem."  After about 5 minutes, I get dropped to a shell with the following: "ALERT! /dev/sda5 does not exist."
2006-07-16T15:11:00.000Z	Kaervek	riddlebox	when all the drives are installed, WinXP boots fine.
2006-07-16T15:12:00.000Z	Kaervek	riddlebox	it's as if Ubuntu can't differentiate between the drives and doesn't know where the root filesystem is located when there is more than 1 drive.
2006-07-16T15:17:00.000Z	Kaervek		Nobdy has any info as to why Ubuntu fails to load with multiple harddisks installed?  I'm dual-booting via GRUB.  WindowsXP boots fine.
2006-07-16T15:18:00.000Z	riddlebox	Kaervek	so xp is /dev/hda1 I assume, can you boot into the livecd and see what options grub is using to try to boot ubuntu
2006-07-16T15:19:00.000Z	Kaervek	riddlebox	I can do that. By "options grub is using," what should I keep an eye out for?
2006-07-16T15:20:00.000Z	riddlebox	Kaervek	I mean you have to look at /etc/grub/menu.lst and see how it is trying to boot ubuntu
2006-07-16T15:20:00.000Z	Kaervek	riddlebox	OK.  Give me a few minutes to boot up...
2006-07-16T15:20:00.000Z	riddlebox	Kaervek	I will be cooking, so I will be in and out, you can pm me if you want, then I will see it for sure
2006-07-16T15:21:00.000Z	Kaervek	riddlebox	outstanding.  thanks alot for your patience...
