2012-06-24T12:34:00.000Z	ruhil	tking	you must have the harddisk image stored somewhere on your system, you just need that to backup
2012-06-24T12:35:00.000Z	tking	ruhil	so i should just copy that right?
2012-06-24T12:35:00.000Z	ruhil	tking	yeah, you can do that, then the next time you install virtual box, create a new virtual machine to use that harddisk image
2012-06-24T12:36:00.000Z	tking		ok
2012-06-24T12:36:00.000Z	ruhil	tking	or you can backup the virtual machine file as well (it must be located in "~/virtaulbx vms" folder)
2012-06-24T12:37:00.000Z	ruhil	tking	the harddisk image will have an extension one of vdi,vmdk,vhd or hdd
