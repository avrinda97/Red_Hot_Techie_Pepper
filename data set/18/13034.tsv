2006-01-25T17:26:00.000Z	anjin_		anyone get a look at my xorg.conf yet?
2006-01-25T17:28:00.000Z	anjin_		I had trouble with isos until I downloaded K3b
2006-01-25T17:30:00.000Z	anjin_		In case it was missed, my xorg.conf is at: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/7394  ... still waiting for help on my screen res
2006-01-25T17:30:00.000Z	nbound	anjin_	whats the problem?
2006-01-25T17:31:00.000Z	nbound	anjin_	reconfigure x
2006-01-25T17:38:00.000Z	nbound	anjin_	did u reconfigure x
2006-01-25T17:39:00.000Z	nbound	anjin_	what did u choose for max res in the resolution part
2006-01-25T17:39:00.000Z	nbound	anjin_	check them all including it
2006-01-25T17:40:00.000Z	nbound	anjin_	it will use the highest by default
2006-01-25T17:40:00.000Z	anjin_	nbound	alright, I'll try again.  Should I lower it from 24 bit to 16 and see if that helps as well?
2006-01-25T17:40:00.000Z	nbound	anjin_	yeah ur card may not have enough texture memory
2006-01-25T17:43:00.000Z	anjin_	nbound	Still only offers me 640x480 and 800x600
2006-01-25T17:44:00.000Z	nbound	anjin_	how much texture mem on the card?
2006-01-25T17:44:00.000Z	anjin_	nbound	honestly I dont know.. this was a hand-me-down computer from work
2006-01-25T17:45:00.000Z	nbound	anjin_	my guess that it may not have enough texture mem
2006-01-25T17:45:00.000Z	anjin_	nbound	it was able to do 1024x768 using an old copy of nt4.0 though.. so I know it's capable on a hardware level
2006-01-25T17:47:00.000Z	nbound	anjin_	it would either be a BIOS option or a motherboard jumper
2006-01-25T17:56:00.000Z	nbound	anjin_	doing hardware swaps like that its generally a good idea to do a clean reinstall
