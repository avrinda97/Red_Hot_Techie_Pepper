2009-11-12T00:03:00.000Z	fccf	scratchme	huh? what are you trying to do... linux has it's own permissioning system, I am not sure what you are trying to do
2009-11-12T00:04:00.000Z	scratchme	fccf	I'm running sudo /usr/lib/nx/nx-node-login test-nx nx 22 nxserver --check
2009-11-12T00:04:00.000Z	scratchme	fccf	and I get Warning: Identity file not accessible: No such file or directory.  Permission denied (publickey,password)
2009-11-12T00:05:00.000Z	scratchme	fccf	so I'm trying to find out what file was denied so I can fix it.
2009-11-12T00:06:00.000Z	fccf	scratchme	can you get a --verbose from that command
2009-11-12T00:06:00.000Z	scratchme	fccf	--verbose adds no extra debugging.
2009-11-12T00:06:00.000Z	fccf	scratchme	/var/log/auth.log???
2009-11-12T00:07:00.000Z	scratchme	fccf	no recent entries with errors.
2009-11-12T00:10:00.000Z	fccf	scratchme	doing a little playing around... give me a few min to see if I can do something here... Q. what function is that which you are running? discribe what you are doing, or trying to do
2009-11-12T00:10:00.000Z	scratchme	fccf	after a little digging, it looks like the filename is blank (double spaces where a file shows in other similar errors on the internet searches)
2009-11-12T00:11:00.000Z	scratchme	fccf	I'm trying to get freenx to install on a fresh install of 9.10 i386.
2009-11-12T00:12:00.000Z	scratchme	fccf	it's possible I messed up but, I was following the directions on the page here:  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FreeNX
2009-11-12T00:28:00.000Z	fccf	scratchme	I am recovering from a crash ... seems like the command you are using isn't in those instructions... is there a --user option... I think there it may need you to identify as a local user to access an X session... just a thought
2009-11-12T00:30:00.000Z	scratchme	fccf	I'll deal with it later.  I might try another approach.
2009-11-12T00:30:00.000Z	scratchme	fccf	thx anyway.
