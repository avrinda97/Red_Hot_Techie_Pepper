2012-10-29T01:22:00.000Z	inorunforyou	ActionParsnip	I don't want lubuntu
2012-10-29T01:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	inorunforyou	then change the link to ubuntu....to hard?
2012-10-29T01:23:00.000Z	inorunforyou	ActionParsnip	how does this help me? I downloaded that already
2012-10-29T01:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	inorunforyou	i thought you wanted the ISO?
2012-10-29T01:24:00.000Z	inorunforyou	ActionParsnip	hello, what is the md5sum for ubuntu-12.10-desktop-amd64.iso   ?  7ad57cadae955bd04019389d4b9c1dcb is listed but that does not seem right (I downloaded twice from different mirrors and got a different md5sum)
2012-10-29T01:25:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	inorunforyou	try searching the web for the hash you calculated
2012-10-29T01:25:00.000Z	inorunforyou	ActionParsnip	no results
2012-10-29T01:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	inorunforyou	sounds like a bad download
2012-10-29T01:27:00.000Z	inorunforyou	ActionParsnip	twice?  With the same erroneous md5sum?
2012-10-29T01:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	inorunforyou	maybe the hash is wrong on the site, let me try
2012-10-29T01:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	inorunforyou	7 mins to download
2012-10-29T01:31:00.000Z	inorunforyou	ActionParsnip	guntbert: ca mirror worked with the correct md5sum!
2012-10-29T01:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	inorunforyou	sweet
2012-10-29T01:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	inorunforyou	still want me to make a hash for you or arewe all good?
2012-10-29T01:33:00.000Z	inorunforyou	ActionParsnip	nah, thanks though
2012-10-29T01:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	inorunforyou	no probs
