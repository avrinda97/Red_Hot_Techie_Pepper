2007-02-20T17:16:00.000Z	Enselic``	tracy	follow instructions that came with it and you should be fine
2007-02-20T17:17:00.000Z	Enselic``	tracy	what part of it doesnt you understand?
2007-02-20T17:17:00.000Z	Enselic``	tracy	I can guide yo
2007-02-20T17:18:00.000Z	Enselic``	tracy	well, what for example
2007-02-20T17:18:00.000Z	Enselic``	tracy	the first line you dont get, what'sthat?
2007-02-20T17:19:00.000Z	Enselic``	tracy	go to the source dir and type 'make'
2007-02-20T17:19:00.000Z	Enselic``	tracy	if something happends, that's a good sign
2007-02-20T17:21:00.000Z	Enselic``	tracy	did you get the source from svn/cvs or as a .tar.gz?
2007-02-20T17:22:00.000Z	Enselic``	tracy	when you have extracted the archive, see what files there is by doing 'ls' in the dir
2007-02-20T17:22:00.000Z	Enselic``	tracy	is there a Makefile?
2007-02-20T17:23:00.000Z	Enselic``	tracy	now type 'make'
2007-02-20T17:23:00.000Z	Enselic``	tracy	if it doesn't work, try 'sudo apt-get install buildessential
2007-02-20T17:24:00.000Z	Enselic``	tracy	that probably means you've compiled it already
2007-02-20T17:24:00.000Z	Enselic``	tracy	compiling is not enough, you need to install it also
2007-02-20T17:25:00.000Z	Enselic``	tracy	exactly what is needed for that should be mentioned in the INSTALL or whatever that file is called
2007-02-20T17:25:00.000Z	Enselic``	tracy	for "normal" software, it's 'sudo make install'
2007-02-20T17:25:00.000Z	Enselic``	tracy	but for drivers you probably need to do other stuff of which I'm not into
