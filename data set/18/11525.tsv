2007-05-29T13:21:00.000Z	RAOF	onur	You don't have the linux-restricted-modules package installed.  Boot back into a previous kernel (pressing "esc" at startup if necessary) and install the "linux-generic" package
2007-05-29T13:22:00.000Z	onur	RAOF	ok I'll try but even the previous kernel doesn't boot into X
2007-05-29T13:23:00.000Z	RAOF	onur	Really?  That might be a different problem then.
2007-05-29T13:23:00.000Z	onur	RAOF	in deed I was using nvidia-glx-new. and after this thing happend I've uninstalled it and tried the binary nvidia driver within the new kernel. Could it be because of this
2007-05-29T13:24:00.000Z	RAOF	onur	:(
2007-05-29T13:24:00.000Z	RAOF	onur	The nvidia.com driver is nothing but trouble.
2007-05-29T13:24:00.000Z	onur	RAOF	so shall I re-install nvidia-glx-new
2007-05-29T13:24:00.000Z	RAOF	onur	In fact, the nvidia-glx-new package is the same driver as the (current stable) nvidia.com driver, just easier to install + upgrade.
2007-05-29T13:25:00.000Z	RAOF	onur	Uninstall the nvidia.com driver first.
2007-05-29T13:25:00.000Z	RAOF	onur	The nvidia.com installer has an --uninstall command line switch, IIRC.
2007-05-29T13:25:00.000Z	onur	RAOF	then shall I install nvidia-glx-new ?
2007-05-29T13:26:00.000Z	RAOF	onur	Yes.
2007-05-29T13:27:00.000Z	onur	RAOF	what was the linux component I was to install ?
2007-05-29T13:27:00.000Z	RAOF	onur	"linux-generic"
2007-05-29T13:30:00.000Z	RAOF	onur	linux-generic always depends on the most recent linux-image & linux-restricted-modules
2007-05-29T13:30:00.000Z	onur	RAOF	thanks I am on the way
