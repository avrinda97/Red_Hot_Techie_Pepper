2008-10-06T00:44:00.000Z	_trine	md22	yes does that mean the 32 bit version I have installed won't use both cores

2008-10-06T00:45:00.000Z	md22		_trine:it will jus tghat it will be 32 bit
2008-10-06T00:45:00.000Z	md22		*just that
2008-10-06T00:46:00.000Z	md22		_trine:if you have 4GB oor more of ram then 64 bit would make sense but lest than that 32 bit would be good

2008-10-06T00:47:00.000Z	_trine	md22	t the computer is only running at half it's speed
