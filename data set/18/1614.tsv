2011-01-19T21:17:00.000Z	undecim	jPuff	How is it connected to your computer? USB or network?
2011-01-19T21:18:00.000Z	undecim	jPuff	You should be able to add it to your printer list via System -> Administration -> Printing
2011-01-19T21:18:00.000Z	undecim	jPuff	Yup
2011-01-19T21:18:00.000Z	undecim	jPuff	You should be able to print then
2011-01-19T21:19:00.000Z	undecim	jPuff	Right click on it and see if there is anything in the print Queue
2011-01-19T21:21:00.000Z	jPuff	undecim	there is
2011-01-19T21:22:00.000Z	undecim	jPuff	What is the status of the items in the queue?
2011-01-19T21:22:00.000Z	jPuff	undecim	it says stopped
2011-01-19T21:24:00.000Z	undecim	jPuff	Can you empty the queue and try printing again?
2011-01-19T21:24:00.000Z	undecim	jPuff	Alright then...
2011-01-19T21:26:00.000Z	undecim	jPuff	I'll consult the Ubuntu forums search :P
2011-01-19T21:28:00.000Z	undecim	jPuff	Does the model number shown in System -> Administration -> Printing match the number printed on the printer?
2011-01-19T21:59:00.000Z	jPuff	undecim	it just says Deskjet-F4200-series
2011-01-19T21:59:00.000Z	undecim	jPuff	Does the printer do anything at when you try to print? A light change or come on or anything?
2011-01-19T22:02:00.000Z	jPuff	undecim	nope
2011-01-19T22:03:00.000Z	undecim	jPuff	I honestly have no idea... HP printers are usually just plug-and-play on Linux.
2011-01-19T22:04:00.000Z	undecim	jPuff	Maybe install hplip-gui and see what you can get...
