2006-11-02T08:26:00.000Z	nonono	TIger_IT	sudo doesnt do anything. It seems dead.
2006-11-02T08:27:00.000Z	TIger_IT	nonono	U can entry to Linux in SINGLE USER MODE (as root)
2006-11-02T08:27:00.000Z	nonono	TIger_IT	like: 'sudo mc' - nothing happens
2006-11-02T08:27:00.000Z	TIger_IT	nonono	: mc: command not found
2006-11-02T08:28:00.000Z	nonono	TIger_IT	mc is a program I have. But sudo doesn neither sais it not found nor opens it the program
2006-11-02T08:28:00.000Z	nonono	TIger_IT	'sudo <any-cmd>' does nothing
2006-11-02T08:29:00.000Z	nonono	TIger_IT	,'sudo ls' - no output
2006-11-02T08:29:00.000Z	TIger_IT	nonono	TRY gksudo or kdesu
