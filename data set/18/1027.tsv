2011-06-27T23:02:00.000Z	Gjyvm	leeeroooy_J	3.5
2011-06-27T23:03:00.000Z	leeeroooy_J	Gjyvm	re you using 3.5 on ubuntu 11.04?
2011-06-27T23:03:00.000Z	Gjyvm	leeeroooy_J	thats how i roll
2011-06-27T23:03:00.000Z	leeeroooy_J	Gjyvm	may i ask you when you installed ubuntu 11.04?
2011-06-27T23:04:00.000Z	Gjyvm	leeeroooy_J	couple of days ago
2011-06-27T23:04:00.000Z	leeeroooy_J	Gjyvm	: and you installed 3.5 personally?
2011-06-27T23:05:00.000Z	Gjyvm	leeeroooy_J	yes
2011-06-27T23:06:00.000Z	leeeroooy_J	Gjyvm	ok, does that site use flash or something?
2011-06-27T23:06:00.000Z	Gjyvm	leeeroooy_J	i dont think so, but i cant be sure
2011-06-27T23:06:00.000Z	leeeroooy_J	Gjyvm	try visit without flash, does it still crash?
2011-06-27T23:07:00.000Z	Gjyvm	leeeroooy_J	yes
2011-06-27T23:07:00.000Z	leeeroooy_J	Gjyvm	try disabling javascript, does it still crash?
2011-06-27T23:08:00.000Z	Gjyvm	leeeroooy_J	yep
2011-06-27T23:09:00.000Z	leeeroooy_J	Gjyvm	so it crashes with both flash and javascript disabled? what about disabling images too?
2011-06-27T23:10:00.000Z	Gjyvm	leeeroooy_J	already tried that
2011-06-27T23:10:00.000Z	leeeroooy_J	Gjyvm	with no results? thats some odd problem you re having, i assume you cleared your cache too?
