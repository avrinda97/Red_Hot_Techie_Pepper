2005-06-21T12:06:00.000Z	justin	delire	you don't need a gateway to ping an address that is on the same subnet as you
2005-06-21T12:06:00.000Z	delire	justin	i know
2005-06-21T12:06:00.000Z	delire	justin	that's not his problem
2005-06-21T12:07:00.000Z	justin	delire	then why did you have him add the gateway? you didn't even have him check to see if you could ping the gateway itself first
2005-06-21T12:07:00.000Z	delire	justin	read your scrollback. i asked him this
2005-06-21T12:08:00.000Z	justin	delire	well then if he can't ping the gateway, adding it as the default route isn't going to help with anything
2005-06-21T12:08:00.000Z	delire	justin	thanks
2005-06-21T12:11:00.000Z	justin	delire	why are you having him type random commands that are not going to help with anything?
2005-06-27T11:59:00.000Z	delire	justin	he could break a convention and change "/media/cdrom0" to "/dev/cdrom" perhaps..
2005-06-27T11:59:00.000Z	delire	justin	i take that back
2005-06-30T13:47:00.000Z	delire	justin	gnome, simpler? not so sure about that.
2005-06-30T13:48:00.000Z	justin	delire	compare pretty much any two similar dialogs between gnome and kde, the gnome dialog will have a handful of options, the kde dialog will have 6 tabs and dozens of options
2005-06-30T13:48:00.000Z	justin	delire	now, the gnome approach is better, as long as you don't specifically need one of the options it lacks
2005-06-30T13:50:00.000Z	delire	justin	i use neither, but have grown to be a fan of KDE after having to administer 30 machines used by as many mad students. that said, i do think for everyday use there are a few too many options. hence their new work on simplifying it all radically, hiding such options under 'Advanced buttons' and the like.
2005-06-30T13:52:00.000Z	justin	delire	from what I've seen, many people won't make the slightest effort whatsoever to make their default environment more usable
2005-06-30T13:53:00.000Z	justin	delire	and that goes for windows as well, vis. ugly as hell luna theme and brain dead default fonts
2005-06-30T13:53:00.000Z	delire	justin	i've given workshops on both KDE and Gnome and see people take to a KDE system (and thus Linux) much faster. however, those that are curious, and better described as 'power users' quickly switch to Gnome.
2005-06-30T13:59:00.000Z	delire	justin	wow.. that's news to me.
