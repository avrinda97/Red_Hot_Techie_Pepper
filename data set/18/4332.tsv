2009-04-28T02:03:00.000Z	summelsam		are the intel drivers broken?
2009-04-28T02:04:00.000Z	summelsam		because i cant activate desktop effects, but it worked in 8,1#0
2009-04-28T02:04:00.000Z	summelsam		wifi also worked in 8,10 and now it is broken
2009-04-28T02:04:00.000Z	summelsam		yes
2009-04-28T02:05:00.000Z	summelsam		why does ubuntu always break stuff that worked in previous versions? -_-
2009-04-28T02:05:00.000Z	Gabrys	summelsam	for me it's fixing things that required workarounds from version to version ;)
2009-04-28T02:06:00.000Z	summelsam	Gabrys	well i have 3 important things not wirking in 9,04 which worked in 8,10
2009-04-28T02:06:00.000Z	Gabrys	summelsam	and I'm getting avg 1 bug per new version (but easy to work around usually)
2009-04-28T02:06:00.000Z	summelsam	Gabrys	wifi, graphics and touchpad broken,,, worked fine last year,,,,
2009-04-28T02:08:00.000Z	Gabrys	summelsam	wifi working better for me, Intel graphics screwed up (but already worked around), everything else at least as good as before (for me)
2009-04-28T02:08:00.000Z	summelsam	Gabrys	whats the intel fix/workaround?
2009-04-28T02:10:00.000Z	Gabrys	summelsam	install a bunch of packages and run compiz by: SKIP_CHECKS=yes compiz if you have one certain Intel card (run normally for the rest)
