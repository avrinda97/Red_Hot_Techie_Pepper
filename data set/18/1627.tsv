2011-12-10T20:25:00.000Z	nvz		whats the proceedure for installing a proposed package?
2011-12-10T20:25:00.000Z	Cradam	nvz	apt-get install packagename
2011-12-10T20:26:00.000Z	nvz	Cradam	right, but do I need any special sources?
2011-12-10T20:26:00.000Z	Cradam	nvz	oh, you mean for beta applications and such?
2011-12-10T20:27:00.000Z	nvz	Cradam	yessir.. apt-cache show hedgewars shows 0.9.15 not the proposed 0.9.17
2011-12-10T20:27:00.000Z	Cradam	nvz	you will have to see whether hedgewars has its own ppa
2011-12-10T20:27:00.000Z	nvz	Cradam	https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/hedgewars/0.9.17-1~natty0.1/+build/2949258 says its on primary archive universe
2011-12-10T20:28:00.000Z	Cradam	nvz	ahh do apt-get update
2011-12-10T20:28:00.000Z	nvz	Cradam	I already have 0.9.17 I compiled in my homedir.. but I want to test the new package
2011-12-10T20:28:00.000Z	nvz	Cradam	I did that just now and apt-cache show still says 0.9.15
2011-12-10T20:29:00.000Z	nvz	Cradam	I'm on natty
2011-12-10T20:29:00.000Z	Cradam	nvz	ahh thats why
2011-12-10T20:29:00.000Z	Cradam	nvz	why not, ubuntu classic mode is there
2011-12-10T20:29:00.000Z	nvz	Cradam	unless things drastically changed gnome is horribly broken in 11.10
2011-12-10T20:30:00.000Z	Cradam	nvz	they didnt change gnome between 11.4 and 11.10
2011-12-10T20:31:00.000Z	nvz	Cradam	b.s. cause 11.4 has gnome2 and 11.10 has gnome 3, and gnome-panel is one thing that is horribly broken in 11.10 doesnt allow the right click at all to do any customization
2011-12-10T20:31:00.000Z	Cradam	nvz	try mint 11 or mint 12 for a more classic feel
2011-12-10T20:33:00.000Z	nvz	Cradam	I'm a 12 year debian veteran.. I am only using ubuntu as a means to understand how it works. I am not interested in mint or changing my distro.. I just wanted to test the hedgewars package.. not a big deal
