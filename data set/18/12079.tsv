2007-01-05T17:52:00.000Z	ozzloy		ekiga is able to display pictures from my webcam, but i don't know which /dev to use for mplayer, how do i find it?
2007-01-05T17:54:00.000Z	ozzloy		er... what i mean is that i have ekiga, and that i am using it to display video from my webcam.  i'd like to use mplayer, but i have to specify the device in /dev/something
2007-01-05T17:54:00.000Z	ozzloy		how do i find out which /dev/* ekiga is using?
2007-01-05T17:55:00.000Z	SurfnKid	ozzloy	look at some config file on the ./ekiga folder
2007-01-05T17:58:00.000Z	ozzloy	SurfnKid	i have no ./.ekiga
2007-01-05T17:58:00.000Z	ozzloy	SurfnKid	or ./ekiga for that matter
2007-01-05T17:59:00.000Z	SurfnKid	ozzloy	not sure where it might be
2007-01-05T06:00:00.000Z	ozzloy	SurfnKid	nope
2007-01-05T06:01:00.000Z	SurfnKid	ozzloy	./gconf/apps/ekiga
2007-01-05T06:03:00.000Z	ozzloy	SurfnKid	thanks
2007-01-05T06:04:00.000Z	ozzloy	SurfnKid	this looks like program settings, which widgets are set and stuff
2007-01-05T06:06:00.000Z	SurfnKid	ozzloy	look up in a config file where the /dev is pointing to
2007-01-05T06:08:00.000Z	ozzloy	SurfnKid	i don't know what "a config file" to look in
2007-01-05T06:08:00.000Z	ozzloy	SurfnKid	all the ones under ~/.gconf/apps/ekiga/* don't seem to have it
2007-01-05T06:10:00.000Z	ozzloy	SurfnKid	grep -r "/dev" *   yeilds nothing
2007-01-05T06:10:00.000Z	SurfnKid	ozzloy	mmm
2007-01-05T06:17:00.000Z	ozzloy	SurfnKid	not quite in the help file either
2007-01-05T06:17:00.000Z	SurfnKid	ozzloy	try the website :)
