2008-10-04T02:43:00.000Z	Kl4m	miso	wine is a translator instead of an emulator. The performance hit is minimal and sometimes inexistant.
2008-10-04T02:43:00.000Z	Kl4m	miso	you can't play WoW on Linux without wine.
2008-10-04T02:45:00.000Z	miso	Kl4m	but i can't install wine before i am not administrator of computer
2008-10-04T02:48:00.000Z	Kl4m	miso	It's possible to install wine in your user directory but seriously... You want to play WoW on a machine that you're not admin?
2008-10-04T02:50:00.000Z	miso	Kl4m	yes i am not admin on this machine bot i want play wow
2008-10-04T02:50:00.000Z	miso	Kl4m	*but
2008-10-04T02:51:00.000Z	Kl4m	miso	you will have to install wine in your home directory.
2008-10-04T02:52:00.000Z	miso	Kl4m	but how instal wine in my home directory
2008-10-04T02:54:00.000Z	Kl4m	miso	Also, if by any chance it's to setup a bot, it will not work if the machine doesn't have X server and a 3D card.
2008-10-04T02:55:00.000Z	Kl4m	miso	you could ask #wine about a home directory install
2008-10-04T02:56:00.000Z	miso	Kl4m	and how i can test if i have 3D card and x server?
2008-10-04T02:58:00.000Z	Kl4m	miso	if you installed the ubuntu desktop (not ubuntu server)  you have X. the 3D card, well... look inside the computer??
2008-10-04T03:00:00.000Z	miso	Kl4m	i cant look into machine now..
