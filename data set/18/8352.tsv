2010-05-24T02:22:00.000Z	mistergibson		on Lucid: can barely frigg'n read the dim text ... anyone got a how-to on setting the console text palette to something brighter??
2010-05-24T02:23:00.000Z	maco	mistergibson	erm...brighter than white?
2010-05-24T02:23:00.000Z	mistergibson	maco	Stormx2: seriously, only bold white even shows up
2010-05-24T02:23:00.000Z	maco		!best | alone
2010-05-24T02:23:00.000Z	maco	mistergibson	its not bold for you by default?
2010-05-24T02:24:00.000Z	mistergibson	maco	evidently not
2010-05-24T02:24:00.000Z	mistergibson	maco	you know where the text console color palettes are stored?
2010-05-24T02:24:00.000Z	maco	mistergibson	sudo dpkg-reconfigure consolekit should let you change the font to a thicker one
2010-05-24T02:24:00.000Z	mistergibson	maco	I see
2010-05-24T02:24:00.000Z	mistergibson	maco	thanks
2010-05-24T02:24:00.000Z	maco	mistergibson	but if white isnt bright enough on your screen, that sounds like a your-screen issue
2010-05-24T02:25:00.000Z	mistergibson	maco	no, its not
2010-05-24T02:25:00.000Z	mistergibson	maco	been using it for years just fine
2010-05-24T02:25:00.000Z	mistergibson	maco	its the color palette actually and perhaps the scan rate
2010-05-24T02:25:00.000Z	mistergibson		gfxtext @ 1024.768
2010-05-24T02:26:00.000Z	maco	mistergibson	well if ists a CRT those *do* get darker with age. possibly the colour its showing is meant to be a very light grey i guess. you could change stuff in your ~/.profile i think
2010-05-24T02:26:00.000Z	mistergibson	maco	its actually system-wide I'm looking to alter
2010-05-24T02:27:00.000Z	maco	mistergibson	/etc/profile then
