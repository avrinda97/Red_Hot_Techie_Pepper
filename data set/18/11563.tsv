2010-03-07T13:33:00.000Z	mbn_18	dsync	ohh you want ssh to auth aginst freeradius
2010-03-07T13:35:00.000Z	mbn_18	dsync	it seems openssh does not support radius. but maybe you can achive it using PAM.
2010-03-07T13:36:00.000Z	mbn_18	dsync	maybe there is ssh channel/ or pam channel.
2010-03-07T13:36:00.000Z	mbn_18	dsync	I didnt saw it on the feature list of openssh website
2010-03-07T13:37:00.000Z	mbn_18	dsync	As I said. My guessing is that it is achivable using pam. but I am not sure. ask experts.
