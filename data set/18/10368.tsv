2007-05-25T12:33:00.000Z	homanj	meeow	what are you having problems with?
2007-05-25T12:34:00.000Z	meeow	homanj	: i installed ubuntu and it works fine, IF i boot into recovery mode, from there i can do a "startx" and get into gnome manually, but if i just let the PC boot normally the screen just goes black and nothing happens.
2007-05-25T12:35:00.000Z	meeow	homanj	iv installed the latest drivers for my video card and it seems to be working fine
2007-05-25T12:36:00.000Z	homanj	meeow	did you do any configuration changes to X.org?
2007-05-25T12:36:00.000Z	homanj		well, xorg.conf?
2007-05-25T12:37:00.000Z	meeow	homanj	last night when i was trying i made some changes that the "help file" suggested
2007-05-25T12:37:00.000Z	meeow		this was all to install the video card i have
2007-05-25T12:37:00.000Z	meeow		X800XL
2007-05-25T12:37:00.000Z	meeow		ATI
2007-05-25T12:38:00.000Z	homanj	meeow	perhaps something was mis-configured. i know when i started using ubuntu i screwed up my xorg.conf at least once.
2007-05-25T12:38:00.000Z	homanj	meeow	but i can't offer too much advice
2007-05-25T12:38:00.000Z	meeow		im concidering pulling it and putting another card in and starting over :\
2007-05-25T12:38:00.000Z	meeow	homanj	: if i pull the ATI card and put a nvidia one will i have to make changes in xorg.conf?
2007-05-25T12:39:00.000Z	homanj	meeow	i would assume so, but since i havent done that before, i dont know for sure.
2007-05-25T12:39:00.000Z	homanj	meeow	if you are considering starting over, perhaps a reinstall of linux might be easier than pulling out the video card
2007-05-25T12:40:00.000Z	homanj	meeow	what help file were you following before
2007-05-25T12:41:00.000Z	homanj		night all.
2007-05-25T12:41:00.000Z	homanj	meeow	good luck with your problem
