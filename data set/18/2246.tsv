2010-07-27T20:46:00.000Z	jstoone	philinux	thanks, I'll try it out.
2010-07-27T20:47:00.000Z	philinux	jstoone	mplayer -really-quiet filename
2010-07-27T20:48:00.000Z	jstoone	philinux	what do you mean by "-really-quiet filename"?
2010-07-27T20:49:00.000Z	philinux	jstoone	in the terminal use that option plus the filename of whatever it is you want to play
2010-07-27T20:50:00.000Z	philinux	jstoone	man mplayer
2010-07-27T20:50:00.000Z	jstoone	philinux	yea it's a habbit of mine to do read the man pages before asking further (: thanks
2010-07-27T20:51:00.000Z	philinux	jstoone	have fun
2010-07-27T20:53:00.000Z	philinux	jstoone	ask away there are a lot of eyes in here
2010-07-27T20:56:00.000Z	jstoone	philinux	how do I make a folder, lets say, "scripts" within my 'home' that which I can put my .sh inside but don't need to "./" the file but just execute it like a app?
2010-07-27T20:57:00.000Z	philinux	jstoone	I put all my scripts in one folder. I create a launcher on my desktop for two I use alot
2010-07-27T20:57:00.000Z	jstoone	philinux	or more precisely, how do I add a folder to my, is it, PATH?
2010-07-27T21:00:00.000Z	jstoone	philinux	but still you need to cd to the folder and type ./whateverprogram.sh   insted of just:  whateverprogram
2010-07-27T21:02:00.000Z	philinux	jstoone	or use an alias in bashrc
2010-07-27T21:03:00.000Z	jstoone	philinux	thats an good idea..
