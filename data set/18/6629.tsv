2012-01-15T11:20:00.000Z	n2diy		I just ran df -h and it showed /home using 3.3 gigs, so I deleted to Linux .iso files, which should have freed up 1.4 gig, but df -h still shows 3.3 gigs?
2012-01-15T11:22:00.000Z	kliwon	n2diy	: your / and /home are diff partition ?
2012-01-15T11:24:00.000Z	n2diy	kliwon	no kidding, df -h list them both.
2012-01-15T11:26:00.000Z	kliwon	n2diy	: what size of your HDD ?
2012-01-15T11:27:00.000Z	n2diy	kliwon	100 gig, / has 60, and /home has 40.
2012-01-15T11:28:00.000Z	kliwon	n2diy	: that≈õ strange...should be free up some size if you have already delete some iso files at your home dir
2012-01-15T11:29:00.000Z	n2diy	kliwon	yes, that's what I thought too. I ran updatedb too, but that didn't seem to do anything at all?
2012-01-15T11:32:00.000Z	kliwon	n2diy	: try locate what files taking large space of your HDD
2012-01-15T11:34:00.000Z	n2diy	kliwon	I did, they were the two ~700 mb .iso files that I deleted.
2012-01-15T11:34:00.000Z	kliwon	n2diy	: have no idea mate...sorry :D
2012-01-15T11:36:00.000Z	n2diy	kliwon	ok, thanks for trying.
2012-01-15T11:38:00.000Z	n2diy	kliwon	it's simple! I haven't emptied my trash folder!!
2012-01-15T11:38:00.000Z	kliwon	n2diy	: heheh..kewl...
2012-01-15T11:40:00.000Z	n2diy	kliwon	I'm now at 1.9 gig, so I could dump my entire /home directory onto Dropbox, for off sight backup.
2012-01-15T11:41:00.000Z	kliwon	n2diy	: yeah its good plan to have backup :beer:
2012-01-15T11:43:00.000Z	n2diy	kliwon	cheer and beers!
2012-01-15T11:43:00.000Z	kliwon	n2diy	: got slow line here , i just dump my /home to external HDD
2012-01-15T11:45:00.000Z	n2diy	kliwon	roger that, doing pretty much the same thing here, using grsync between to boxes on the LAN.
