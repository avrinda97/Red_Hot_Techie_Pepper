2006-03-01T12:18:00.000Z	calamari		I've set up a second user account on the system.  There is an Update Notification in the taskbar that I can't get rid of.  Any suggestions?
2006-03-01T12:18:00.000Z	xhie	calamari	just removing it from panel dosent work?
2006-03-01T12:18:00.000Z	calamari	xhie	there isn't a remove option
2006-03-01T12:19:00.000Z	xhie	calamari	O hmm.. I got rid of all the default panels a long time ago
2006-03-01T12:19:00.000Z	calamari	xhie	I removed the panel it was on and it showed up on the other panel
2006-03-01T12:37:00.000Z	xhie	calamari	just update whatever it wants you to? itll go away after that
2006-03-01T12:37:00.000Z	xhie	calamari	yes it goes away after you update
2006-03-01T12:37:00.000Z	calamari	xhie	so there is no other way?
2006-03-01T12:38:00.000Z	xhie	calamari	even though I dont use whatever panel its on i'm pretty sure you can get rid of somehow, I havent seen it in forever, so its possable somehow I guess
2006-03-01T12:40:00.000Z	xhie	calamari	if for some reason you really cant get rid of it that way, then devils pie would do it for you
2006-03-01T12:41:00.000Z	calamari	xhie	what's that?
2006-03-01T12:42:00.000Z	xhie	calamari	Devil's Pie is a really powerfull tool to automaticaly detect windows or applications running and do stuff to them.. window and icon wise.. such as removing them from panels :)
2006-03-01T12:42:00.000Z	xhie	calamari	example, i use it to keep Eterm from showing up in the taskbar
