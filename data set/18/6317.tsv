2008-05-24T21:00:00.000Z	backslash7		I would like to have all my e-mails on my ubuntu server so I can fetch it from my computer and my laptop. I don't wanna have a new mail account on my server, just collect the mails
2008-05-24T21:01:00.000Z	backslash7		Anyone please?

2008-05-24T21:03:00.000Z	backslash7		UBUNTU SERVER: COLLECT MAILS. How ?
2008-05-24T21:04:00.000Z	bijur	backslash7	collect mails using a mail transport agent
2008-05-24T21:04:00.000Z	bijur	backslash7	u can use postfix , a simpler tool or something like qmail
2008-05-24T21:05:00.000Z	backslash7	bijur	Okay, I'll google qmail
2008-05-24T21:06:00.000Z	bijur	backslash7	if u r new to qmail, i'd suggest dont. by the way do u have a public domain for this machine?
2008-05-24T21:08:00.000Z	backslash7	bijur	Any idea ?
2008-05-24T21:09:00.000Z	bijur	backslash7	if u r trying to collect public mail to this server, u ll need a public domain so that the servers outside can know where to send their mail to
2008-05-24T21:10:00.000Z	bijur	backslash7	if u r looking for a mail client u have the all in one evolution which can receive exchange/pop3/imap mails
2008-05-24T21:10:00.000Z	backslash7	bijur	I'm looking for a method like: The server fetches the mail from some PHP3-Accounts and deliver them to me / I can get them in the LAN from my server
2008-05-24T21:11:00.000Z	backslash7	bijur	No mail client no ^^
2008-05-24T21:12:00.000Z	bijur	backslash7	aaaaah! sure man, just use an email server on ur server which keeps popping the mails from pop3 and then fwd's it via its sendmail/postfix to ur local server, wud be much faster to access that way! bravo!
2008-05-24T21:13:00.000Z	backslash7	bijur	lol why u so lucky now? ^^ hehe anyways... I'm looking for the simplest ones, easy and fast to setup, I don't need much options, just give me the mail ^^
2008-05-24T21:13:00.000Z	backslash7	bijur	Can you say a simple one? Easy to set up I mean ?
2008-05-24T21:14:00.000Z	bijur	backslash7	i think postfix wud be able to do it. but i am not sure if it'dbe that easy to configure. sorry man, i havent tried doing this, though this has always been on my agenda
