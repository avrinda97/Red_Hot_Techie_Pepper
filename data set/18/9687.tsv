2007-03-06T11:50:00.000Z	standingstill		anyone feel like helping me get my wireless card working?
2007-03-06T11:51:00.000Z	standingstill		i've been beating my head against a wall with this for weeks
2007-03-06T11:51:00.000Z	standingstill		i'm trying to use ndisgtk and ndiswrapper
2007-03-06T11:51:00.000Z	standingstill		i finally got the two .inf files "i think i need"
2007-03-06T11:52:00.000Z	standingstill		bcmwl5.inf
2007-03-06T11:52:00.000Z	standingstill		and bcmwl5a.inf
2007-03-06T11:52:00.000Z	standingstill		can anyone help me figure out the steps involved in getting these working
2007-03-06T11:53:00.000Z	ledbettj	standingstill	 are you setting up a driver with ndiswrapper?
2007-03-06T11:54:00.000Z	ledbettj	standingstill	 what have you got so far?
2007-03-06T11:55:00.000Z	ledbettj	standingstill	 does it show up in  network settings as wlan0 or wmaster0 or anything?
2007-03-06T12:00:00.000Z	ledbettj	standingstill	 ok, if you can't configure that wireless connection to work, that means that first we need to figure out what driver is installed (thats not working) and unload it...
2007-03-06T12:01:00.000Z	ledbettj	standingstill	loaded already using ndiswrapper?
2007-03-06T12:03:00.000Z	ledbettj	standingstill	but it doesn't say "hardware attached?"
2007-03-06T12:04:00.000Z	ledbettj	standingstill	 hmm, I would suggest removing them both and installing just one.  I'm not sure exactly how to trouble shoot this.
2007-03-06T12:05:00.000Z	ledbettj	standingstill	I would uninstall them both, then use "sudo ndiswrapper -i theinffile.inf" to install one.
2007-03-06T12:05:00.000Z	ledbettj	standingstill	 then try to configure it with the network manager
2007-03-06T12:06:00.000Z	ledbettj	standingstill	 sorry I couldn't help more
2007-03-06T12:09:00.000Z	standingstill	ledbettj	this is the error msg i've been getting when i launch ndisgtk from the command line
