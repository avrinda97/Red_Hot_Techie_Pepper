2007-01-20T15:49:00.000Z	savvas	KingLear	do you mean: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade
2007-01-20T15:50:00.000Z	KingLear	savvas	 I am already doing an sudo apte-get update
2007-01-20T15:51:00.000Z	savvas	KingLear	well ok, but this will update and prompt you to install all the new updates
2007-01-20T15:51:00.000Z	KingLear	savvas	 since there are downloaded software , I want them to install so that the system gets updated alongside the download process
2007-01-20T15:52:00.000Z	KingLear	savvas	 the command you told me ,
2007-01-20T15:52:00.000Z	savvas	KingLear	it updates the software list (update), and then downloads and installs all the new software (upgrade)
2007-01-20T15:54:00.000Z	KingLear	savvas	 does it fufills MY purpose?
2007-01-20T15:55:00.000Z	savvas	KingLear	that's what upgrade does
2007-01-20T15:56:00.000Z	savvas	KingLear	if you want to install only several software packages, you do: sudo apt-get install package1 package2 package3
2007-01-20T15:57:00.000Z	KingLear	savvas	 I am doing a complete Update/upgrade so I think there must be a way to do this
2007-01-20T15:57:00.000Z	savvas	KingLear	why don't you try the command and see if it helps you
2007-01-20T15:58:00.000Z	KingLear	savvas	 I did
2007-01-20T15:59:00.000Z	savvas	KingLear	try: sudo apt-get clean && sudo apt-get autoclean
2007-01-20T16:00:00.000Z	savvas	KingLear	you mean you want to speficically check for updates for only one package/software?
2007-01-20T16:02:00.000Z	savvas	KingLear	simoultaneous update and upgrade? i think that's not allowed by apt
