2007-02-04T10:30:00.000Z	tyler_		I just installed xfce4 but gnomes session manager dosn't see it how can I start up xfce4 instead of gnome??
2007-02-04T10:31:00.000Z	unop	tyler_	 errm, have you got the xubuntu-desktop package installed?
2007-02-04T10:32:00.000Z	tyler_	unop	I'm pretty sure I did a sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop
2007-02-04T10:32:00.000Z	unop	tyler_	 well, verify that it is indeed installed -- dpkg -l | grep -i xubuntu
2007-02-04T10:34:00.000Z	tyler_	unop	that command returns nothing but when I do an slocate xubuntu it returns lots
2007-02-04T10:34:00.000Z	unop	tyler_	 errm, if that command returns nothing, it's likely the package isnt installed
2007-02-04T10:35:00.000Z	tyler_	unop	hmmm thats odd because I just went through my command history and sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop is in there and I don't remember seeing any errors on its completion
2007-02-04T10:36:00.000Z	unop	tyler_	 and you sure the GDM has no entry for XFCE?
2007-02-04T10:36:00.000Z	tyler_	unop	nope just GNOME failsafe gnome and failsafe xterm
2007-02-04T10:40:00.000Z	unop	tyler_	 does locate/slocate find you a xfce.desktop file?
2007-02-04T10:40:00.000Z	tyler_	unop	hold on I'll check
2007-02-04T10:41:00.000Z	tyler_	unop	negative, but all the friggin icons and language packs for xfce are installed
2007-02-04T10:41:00.000Z	unop	tyler_	 if you installed xfce since the last updatedb .. you'll need to run it again
2007-02-04T10:41:00.000Z	tyler_	unop	lol well the install just finished 5 minutes ago I guess I could just try it again
2007-02-04T10:42:00.000Z	unop	tyler_	 run updatedb and then try locate again
2007-02-04T10:43:00.000Z	tyler_	unop	will do
2008-07-17T06:06:00.000Z	unop	tyler_	ps
2008-07-17T06:06:00.000Z	unop	tyler_	gnome-system-monitor
