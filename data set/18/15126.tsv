2005-05-10T06:04:00.000Z	transgress		grar... i must have dvd player!  damn it.  guess i'll try one other distro and if it doesn't work then i'll probably come back to a fresh install of ubuntu and try some other stuff with it.
2005-05-10T06:05:00.000Z	hybrid	transgress	how about mplayer
2005-05-10T06:05:00.000Z	transgress	hybrid	crashes with something about decode_audio
2005-05-10T06:05:00.000Z	hybrid	transgress	do like me and compile it
2005-05-10T06:05:00.000Z	hybrid		it worked then
2005-05-10T06:06:00.000Z	hybrid		i couldnt get it to work from synaptic
2005-05-10T06:06:00.000Z	transgress	hybrid	from the deb source or from the site?
2005-05-10T06:06:00.000Z	hybrid		trangress: fro the website; and i would grab the essintials while you are there too
2005-05-10T06:07:00.000Z	transgress		is there a make deb command or should i get checkinstall?
2005-05-10T06:07:00.000Z	hybrid		to compile
2005-05-10T06:07:00.000Z	transgress		yeah
2005-05-10T06:08:00.000Z	hybrid		./config >>>make>>>sudo make install
2005-05-10T06:08:00.000Z	transgress		i'd like to be able to keep up with it so i can remove it completely if i want to upgrade it or something
2005-05-10T06:08:00.000Z	transgress		yeah but make install doesn't give me a way to remove it usually
2005-05-10T06:08:00.000Z	transgress		i'll grab checkinstall
2005-05-10T06:09:00.000Z	transgress		hey hybrid what do i do with the essentials?
2005-05-10T06:10:00.000Z	hybrid		juss have them on your computer before you compile
2005-05-10T06:10:00.000Z	transgress	hybrid	well i downloaded them, but do i need to put them in a particular place?  or at least untar them?
