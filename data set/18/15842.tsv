2005-02-05T14:53:00.000Z	haggai	randabis	thanks for the report about oo2, making a fix now
2005-02-05T15:00:00.000Z	randabis	haggai	no problem :)
2005-02-05T15:00:00.000Z	randabis		I just hope my other bugs get fixed too. :p
2005-02-05T15:01:00.000Z	randabis		Fabio and I seem to be getting to the bottom of my nfs problems...but I still can't get it going yet
2005-02-05T15:04:00.000Z	randabis		yes
2005-02-05T15:04:00.000Z	randabis		it is being fixed though
2005-02-05T15:04:00.000Z	randabis		I reported a bug about it and haggai is now fixing the problem
2005-02-05T15:05:00.000Z	randabis		have you done an apt-get update?
2005-02-05T15:05:00.000Z	randabis		you probably can't install it because the package is being fixed
2005-02-05T15:05:00.000Z	randabis		there is a problem in openoffice.org2-debian-files that breaks the installation
2005-02-05T15:06:00.000Z	randabis		ah that could be it as well
2005-02-05T15:07:00.000Z	haggai	randabis	I didn't spot it because it works if -debian-files from oo1 is installed
2005-02-05T15:07:00.000Z	randabis	haggai	ah! that would make a difference hehe
2005-02-05T15:08:00.000Z	randabis		I don't have any of oo.g 1 installed
2005-02-05T15:08:00.000Z	randabis		oo1 even
2005-02-05T15:09:00.000Z	haggai	randabis	I know :)  That's why you saw the problem and I didn't
2005-02-05T15:10:00.000Z	randabis		glad I was of assistance :)
2005-02-05T15:10:00.000Z	haggai	randabis	I just uploaded a fixed package
