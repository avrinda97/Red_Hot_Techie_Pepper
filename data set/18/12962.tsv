2006-10-12T07:03:00.000Z	Ramunas		anybody here using xchat with Opera?
2006-10-12T07:03:00.000Z	oskude	Ramunas	xchat with opera ? how does that work ?
2006-10-12T07:04:00.000Z	Ramunas	oskude	you click on link in xchat and it opens in Opera
2006-10-12T07:04:00.000Z	oskude	Ramunas	aaah, lol... hmm, look in options
2006-10-12T07:05:00.000Z	Ramunas	oskude	well the problem is that it does't work as it should
2006-10-12T07:05:00.000Z	oskude	Ramunas	wait, i got option "open link in opera" when i right click on a clink in xchat
2006-10-12T07:05:00.000Z	oskude	Ramunas	and that seems to work here
2006-10-12T07:06:00.000Z	Ramunas	oskude	it works, but if I set xchat to open links with just single left click on link, it doesn't work
2006-10-12T07:07:00.000Z	oskude	Ramunas	well, dunno about that...
2006-10-12T07:09:00.000Z	oskude	Ramunas	maybe you have to edit System > Preferences > Preferred Applications > Web Browser (maybe xchat uses the system default browser)
2006-10-12T07:10:00.000Z	Ramunas	oskude	already tried that, it still Opens it in the current tab, not in new tab as it should
2006-10-12T07:10:00.000Z	oskude	Ramunas	well, that seems like problem of opera, so you tell opera to open new tabs...
2006-10-12T07:11:00.000Z	oskude	Ramunas	then look that you have the same command in preferred apps as you used in terminal...
2006-10-12T07:12:00.000Z	Ramunas	oskude	I already checked, and in terminal it opens a new tab, though not in xchat
2006-10-12T07:13:00.000Z	oskude	Ramunas	well, better than mine, if i make opera preferred app (opera -newpage %s) it doesnt do anything with left click in xchat, lol
2006-10-12T07:14:00.000Z	Ramunas	oskude	you need to enable left click on urls in xchat first
2006-10-12T07:14:00.000Z	Ramunas	oskude	/set gui_url_mod 0 does that
2006-10-12T07:17:00.000Z	oskude	Ramunas	funny that this doesnt give any results "cat .xchat2/xchat.conf | grep gui_url_mod"
