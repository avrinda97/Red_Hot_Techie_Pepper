2007-05-31T13:33:00.000Z	usr_rob		how can i let the gnomebaker access my dvd-drive as normal user? ( /dev/sg0)
2007-05-31T13:33:00.000Z	pietro10	usr_rob	go to System > Administration > Users and Groups
2007-05-31T13:33:00.000Z	pietro10		Select your name from the list, click Edit, and open the Privledges tab
2007-05-31T13:34:00.000Z	pietro10		And then enable your user to use anything that has CD drive in it
2007-05-31T13:34:00.000Z	usr_rob	pietro10	i have checked all there it won't help. i did chgrp robert /dev/sg0 , but it did not work either
2007-05-31T13:34:00.000Z	pietro10		sudo chgrp robert /dev/sd0
2007-05-31T13:34:00.000Z	pietro10		Or better yet sudo chgrp robert /dev/sd*
2007-05-31T13:34:00.000Z	usr_rob	pietro10	i forgott to write sudo in here, of course i did :)
2007-05-31T13:35:00.000Z	pietro10		OK, then /dev/sd0 is not your DVD drive
2007-05-31T13:35:00.000Z	pietro10		Type mount
2007-05-31T13:36:00.000Z	usr_rob	pietro10	i get error message, cannot access /dev/sg0 , check user rights
2007-05-31T13:36:00.000Z	pietro10		Weird
2007-05-31T13:36:00.000Z	usr_rob	pietro10	chmod 755 ?
2007-05-31T13:36:00.000Z	pietro10		try that if it doesn't work then I don't know what will
2007-05-31T13:36:00.000Z	usr_rob	pietro10	okey, thx mate
