2005-02-14T13:41:00.000Z	Amaranth	timlinux_zzzzzzz	Depends on what card you have.
2005-02-14T13:41:00.000Z	timlinux_zzzzzzz		erm.....
2005-02-14T13:41:00.000Z	Amaranth		It does up to the Radeon 9250, iirc
2005-02-14T13:41:00.000Z	Amaranth		If you're running Ubuntu and have a supported card it should have been setup on its own.

2005-02-14T13:42:00.000Z	Amaranth	timlinux_zzzzzzz	Did you install the ATI driver from ATI or just left what Ubuntu setup for you?
