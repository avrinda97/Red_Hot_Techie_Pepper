2012-05-21T12:29:00.000Z	Jordan_U	angel282	Do you know anything other than that the sever was down? Do you have any physical access to this server?
2012-05-21T12:30:00.000Z	angel282	Jordan_U	no, because it's a dedicated server which I purchased over the net, but I already recovered the server back to 10.04 LTS, I am just trying to find the best way to upgrade the version
2012-05-21T12:30:00.000Z	angel282	Jordan_U	I must upgrade at least to higher version because I need to use some packages that not supported on 10.04 LTS
2012-05-21T12:31:00.000Z	Jordan_U	angel282	I assume that the server is running under a virtual machine?
2012-05-21T12:32:00.000Z	angel282	Jordan_U	I think so, but I am not sure, I've purchased this package - http://iweb.com/smart-server-hosting/overview
2012-05-21T12:35:00.000Z	angel282	Jordan_U	I think it using some virtualization service named "Xen"
2012-05-21T12:35:00.000Z	Jordan_U	angel282	Since it uses Xen, there is a chance (depending on how it's configured) that you can't upgrade the kernel itself, because the kernel is loaded by the virtual machine software separately from the VM image, and thus can't be changed from within the VM. If that's the case, any upgrade not following your hosting service's procedures will probably fail.
2012-05-21T12:36:00.000Z	angel282	Jordan_U	in the upgrade process I was asked if I want to upgrade the grub and I said no, can this be the cause why the server not booting up after the upgrade?
2012-05-21T12:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	angel282	It's possible. What was the exact message?
2012-05-21T12:38:00.000Z	angel282	Jordan_U	I don't have it right now, but let me try to upgrade again .. and I will be able to write you the message content
2012-05-21T12:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	angel282	It looks like iweb has a live chat support on their website. Have you tried that yet?
2012-05-21T12:41:00.000Z	angel282	Jordan_U	I've started the upgrade process in the meanwhile I will try to ask them on the chat if there is some iweb tutorial etc..
2012-05-21T12:42:00.000Z	Jordan_U	angel282	Ask them if they support their Ubuntu configuration being upgraded.
2012-05-21T12:45:00.000Z	angel282	Jordan_U	by the way another thing if I edit the /etc/update-manager/release-upgrades and set Prompt=normal; so the upgrade working and I can upgrade to 11.04 (I think) and it working server working after reboot, but when I try to run another upgrade to 12.04 so I have the same problem server not responding to ssh after reboot
2012-05-21T12:52:00.000Z	angel282	Jordan_U	here is the grub message - A new version of configuration file /etc/default/grub is available, but the version installed currently has been locally modified.
2012-05-21T12:52:00.000Z	Jordan_U	angel282	Can you pastebin your current /etc/default/grub ?
2012-05-21T12:56:00.000Z	Jordan_U	angel282	Sorry, I need to leave now. I doubt that that is what caused your problem, but especiall since you have backups I would try using the package maintainter's version this time.
