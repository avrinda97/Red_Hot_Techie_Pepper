2008-02-17T11:32:00.000Z	rainwalker	christopher	what are you trying to do?
2008-02-17T11:33:00.000Z	rainwalker	christopher	what happens if you run "SKIP_CHECKS=yes compiz" in a terminal?
2008-02-17T11:34:00.000Z	rainwalker	christopher	wait, are you saying you already have compiz running?
2008-02-17T11:37:00.000Z	rainwalker	christopher	from that output it sounds like compiz is running?
2008-02-17T11:40:00.000Z	rainwalker	christopher	check out what zqwe said first
2008-02-17T11:43:00.000Z	rainwalker	christopher	didn't that SKIP_CHECKS command get compiz running? it sounds like it started
2008-02-17T11:45:00.000Z	rainwalker	christopher	do you have shadows around your windows? do your menus fade in and out?
2008-02-17T11:45:00.000Z	rainwalker	christopher	you have to enable the desktop cube before you can use it
2008-02-17T11:46:00.000Z	rainwalker	christopher	ok, so run that skip checks command again (leave the terminal open) and hold control + alt + click
2008-02-17T11:47:00.000Z	rainwalker	christopher	that's what you do to rotate the cube
