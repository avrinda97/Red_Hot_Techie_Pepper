2008-11-07T19:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	runpain2_	and choose that sound
2008-11-07T19:07:00.000Z	runpain2_	ActionParsnip1	when i open the directory where the orignal file is and move cursor over it it plays but when i put it in any folder and change the soud to that file it wont play
2008-11-07T19:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	runpain2_	ah, is it the same file type as other system sounds ( Im fairly clueless here as i dont use silly sounds )
