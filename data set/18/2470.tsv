2010-05-08T15:59:00.000Z	Appl6	greezmunkey	Yes, the old version of grub will boot into that new kernel just fine.
2010-05-08T16:00:00.000Z	greezmunkey	Appl6	Sweet, erUSUL a quick apt-cache search should show that (if it's here) right?
2010-05-08T16:19:00.000Z	Appl6	greezmunkey	Haha.  Yes, it's normal for Ubuntu to keep a backup kernel, for that reason.  Though usually it will install the new one and keep the old one around.  You can check with "ls /boot".
2010-05-08T16:22:00.000Z	greezmunkey	Appl6	So that's the piece I'm missing, SO it goes like this: Safe upgrade gets you all the code, configures the system for the latest kernel, then you manually make the new kernel, and configure grub to boot it???
2010-05-08T16:22:00.000Z	Appl6	greezmunkey	Whoa, old school.  In Ubuntu you usually just download precompiled kernels.  You can compile ones if you want, but most people don't.
2010-05-08T16:23:00.000Z	Appl6	greezmunkey	Part of getting the new precompiled kernel involves it being automatically added to grub as another option.  So you'll see multiple Ubuntu lines with different kernel numbers on them.
2010-05-08T16:23:00.000Z	greezmunkey	Appl6	Ok then, skip step two, just modify grub to boot the new kernel then>
2010-05-08T16:24:00.000Z	greezmunkey	Appl6	I'll check the config file, haven't looked at it...
2010-05-08T16:24:00.000Z	Appl6	greezmunkey	You don't have to modify grub, it should be done automatically.
2010-05-08T16:25:00.000Z	greezmunkey	Appl6	I agree that seems to be what should have happened, but explain this: 2.6.31-14-generic #48-Ubuntu SMP Fri Oct 16
2010-05-08T16:25:00.000Z	greezmunkey	Appl6	Hehe
2010-05-08T16:26:00.000Z	Appl6	greezmunkey	2.6.31 is the kernel version.  14 is 14th Ubuntu specific patch applied to the kernel.  SMP is a compilation option for the kernel.  I don't know what 48 is for.
2010-05-08T16:27:00.000Z	Appl6	greezmunkey	But I'm still not sure what you're asking.  Can you boot into Ubuntu?  What problems are you having?
2010-05-08T16:28:00.000Z	greezmunkey	Appl6	It's all good - I am comparing this system to one right next to it. The other runs on 2.6.32.22-generic, this one is on 2.6.31-14-generic after doing the same update...
2010-05-08T16:29:00.000Z	Appl6	greezmunkey	Both Ubuntu?  It almost sounds like one of them isn't pulling from the lucid repositories.
2010-05-08T16:29:00.000Z	Appl6	greezmunkey	Either that or one didn't survive the upgrade process too well.
2010-05-08T16:30:00.000Z	greezmunkey	Appl6	I'm just trying to understand why - That's possible. This one is an upgrade, the other one is a clean install :)
2010-05-08T16:31:00.000Z	greezmunkey	Appl6	That (what you said) could explain some wierd error messeges I get on boot. The system still seems to run alright though.
