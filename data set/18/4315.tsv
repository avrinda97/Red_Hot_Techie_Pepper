2009-12-28T21:58:00.000Z	baz_work	sacarlson	I found that you can actually import GPG keys through "Accessories" -> "Passwords And Encryption Keys" or in terminal "gpg --import gpg-file" - all you need are the keys in text format - I think I will ssh into an outside box, get the text keys and import them...
2009-12-28T21:59:00.000Z	sacarlson	baz_work	there ya go
2009-12-28T21:59:00.000Z	baz_work	sacarlson	you got me thinking, thanks for your input! And i may setup a vpn for that and other reasons too
