2010-04-30T23:46:00.000Z	lungan	elnur	having the same problem, it works sometimes after just rebooting on the powerbutton
2010-04-30T23:47:00.000Z	elnur	lungan	heh, gonna try it
2010-04-30T23:48:00.000Z	elnur	lungan	that didn't help
2010-04-30T23:49:00.000Z	lungan	elnur	I've tried 5 times and then it did work, but now I'm having the same problem again. Its reeaaally fast when it boots, but for the moment it doesn't work for me neither, something is wrong
2010-04-30T23:56:00.000Z	elnur	lungan	can't boot it even once
2010-05-01T00:03:00.000Z	elnur	lungan	what video card you have and how many displays?
2010-05-01T21:02:00.000Z	elnur	lungan	what kind of?
2010-05-01T21:02:00.000Z	lungan	elnur	think I talked to you yesterday, just a blinkin _ when booting
2010-05-01T21:02:00.000Z	elnur	lungan	i've solved it. how many HDDs you have?
2010-05-01T21:03:00.000Z	lungan	elnur	 1 on the computer
2010-05-01T21:03:00.000Z	lungan	elnur	But it seems to be a problem with the hdd, but I don't know what pronblem
2010-05-01T21:04:00.000Z	elnur	lungan	my problem was that I installed ubuntu on /dev/sda, but in BIOS settings it was set to boot from /dev/sdb :)
2010-05-01T21:04:00.000Z	lungan	elnur	I will check on that later, but how du you set in bios that the computer boots from /dev/sdb
2010-05-01T21:05:00.000Z	elnur	lungan	in bios i can choose one of two HDDs to boot and they are not called /dev/sdX in there)
2010-05-01T21:05:00.000Z	lungan	elnur	I will check that later, thank you.
2010-05-01T21:06:00.000Z	elnur	lungan	np. just make sure that ubuntu is on the booting drive
