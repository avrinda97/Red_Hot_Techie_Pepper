2010-06-19T12:22:00.000Z	Polysics		hello
2010-06-19T12:22:00.000Z	Polysics		anyone has pointers to running my own DNS?
2010-06-19T12:22:00.000Z	Polysics		goal is to have a domain on which i can create subdomains on my VPS
2010-06-19T12:22:00.000Z	HermanDE_	Polysics	How many?
2010-06-19T12:23:00.000Z	HermanDE_	Polysics	Are we talking thousands of first level or thousands of second level?
2010-06-19T12:24:00.000Z	HermanDE_	Polysics	Easy...  Are you doing web serving? or full services on each second level domain?
2010-06-19T12:26:00.000Z	HermanDE_	Polysics	Catchall for all services?
2010-06-19T12:26:00.000Z	HermanDE_	Polysics	Or just a method for a webserver to serve (anything).domainname.tld?
2010-06-19T12:28:00.000Z	HermanDE_	Polysics	You could use just about any webserver installed for virtual hosting...  with a DNS wildcard as the second level....
2010-06-19T12:28:00.000Z	HermanDE_	Polysics	Host it yourself....
2010-06-19T12:28:00.000Z	HermanDE_	Polysics	If you have a static DNS....  Create a DNS server....
2010-06-19T12:29:00.000Z	HermanDE_	Polysics	Host until the cows come home....
2010-06-19T12:30:00.000Z	HermanDE_	Polysics	or a maradns.....  or a PowerDNS....
2010-06-19T12:30:00.000Z	HermanDE_	Polysics	too many choices...
2010-06-19T12:30:00.000Z	HermanDE_	Polysics	find one that offers wildcards.....
2010-06-19T12:30:00.000Z	HermanDE_	Polysics	And it is a pretty steep learning curve if you want to do anything out of the box....
2010-06-19T12:31:00.000Z	HermanDE_	Polysics	A simple thing is to setup with a DNS register that offers a wildcard DNS....
2010-06-19T12:32:00.000Z	HermanDE_	Polysics	use google....  I think Godaddy now offers wildcards....  Hostgater....  Who is your DNS register?
