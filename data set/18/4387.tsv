2009-09-10T04:01:00.000Z	younder	erUSUL	that works. thanks!
2009-09-10T03:44:00.000Z	erUSUL	younder	find / -xdev -mtime 14 | tar cvpjf  /media/VERBATIM/incbackup-100809.tgz
2009-09-10T03:45:00.000Z	younder	erUSUL	it still refuses to crate a empty archive
2009-09-10T03:46:00.000Z	erUSUL	younder	thoes the find command output anything ?
2009-09-10T03:46:00.000Z	younder	erUSUL	if I add the -print option
2009-09-10T03:46:00.000Z	younder	erUSUL	it correctly gets the files newer than 14 days ago
2009-09-10T03:47:00.000Z	erUSUL	younder	then use the print option
2009-09-10T03:49:00.000Z	younder	erUSUL	it still does not want to create a empty archive. Guess it doesn't like pipes anymore..
2009-09-10T03:50:00.000Z	erUSUL	younder	aded the "-T -" as an option
2009-09-10T03:51:00.000Z	erUSUL	younder	hat's to instruct tar to use the filenames given in stdin by the find command
2009-09-10T03:51:00.000Z	erUSUL	younder	so « find / -xdev -mtime 14 | tar -T - -cvpjf /media/VERBATIM/incbackup-100809.tbz2 »
2009-09-10T03:52:00.000Z	erUSUL	younder	j is for bz2 not for gz
2009-09-10T04:02:00.000Z	erUSUL	younder	no problem
2009-09-10T04:16:00.000Z	younder	erUSUL	ended up with:  find / -xdev -mtime 14 -print | tar cvpzf /media/VERBATIM/incbackup100909.tgz -T -
2009-09-10T04:16:00.000Z	erUSUL	younder	ok; nice you let the channel know ;)
2010-10-12T15:43:00.000Z	younder	erUSUL	you select via mouse System/administration and there should be  driver specific entry there.
