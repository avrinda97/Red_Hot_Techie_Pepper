2009-10-17T04:43:00.000Z	usser	lilzeus	smbfs allows you to mount windows shares as if they are local directories
2009-10-17T04:46:00.000Z	usser	lilzeus	you dont have to find it or configure it or anything, just type mount -c cifs //server/share /localmount -o username=<remote user>
2009-10-17T04:48:00.000Z	lilzeus	usser	where //server/share is the directory on ubuntu I want to share, and /localmount is what?
2009-10-17T04:49:00.000Z	usser	lilzeus	no smbfs is a client not a server. if you want to share directories from a linux machines, you need samba package
2009-10-17T04:54:00.000Z	usser	lilzeus	if you share it with samba, just type \\ip of the ubuntu\sharename in windows explorer address bar
2009-10-17T04:55:00.000Z	usser	lilzeus	but generally if you configure everything properly your ubuntu box should show up in my network places
2009-10-17T04:55:00.000Z	lilzeus	usser	I just clicked on the folder and went to sharing, is that 'samba'?
2009-10-17T04:56:00.000Z	usser	lilzeus	thats a bad way to do it! it is samba, but its a gimmick. dont use that tool. Configure sharing properly its not hard
2009-10-17T04:57:00.000Z	lilzeus	usser	my ubuntu box does not show up in network places in windows
2009-10-17T04:58:00.000Z	usser	lilzeus	configure samba sharing properly
2009-10-17T04:58:00.000Z	lilzeus	usser	how do I do that?
2009-10-17T05:01:00.000Z	lilzeus	usser	the name of the ubuntu machine is 'ubuntu-webserver'

2009-10-17T05:01:00.000Z	usser	lilzeus	also look at !samba
2009-10-17T05:02:00.000Z	usser	lilzeus	https://help.ubuntu.com/9.04/serverguide/C/windows-networking.html
2009-10-17T05:25:00.000Z	lilzeus	usser	you there?
2009-10-17T05:25:00.000Z	lilzeus	usser	I followed the instructions here: https://help.ubuntu.com/9.04/serverguide/C/samba-fileserver.html#samba-fileserver-configuration
2009-10-17T05:26:00.000Z	lilzeus	usser	but I am still unable to locate the ubuntu share from Windows
