2007-01-24T07:28:00.000Z	agent	keithhhhh	man rm and you should get into a habit of writing the -rf at the end just in case you press enter at / and end up doing a rm -rf / which will delete every file on your root partition (if you have the rights, if not, then just every single file you can delete)
2007-01-24T07:29:00.000Z	keithhhhh	agent	ah cool
2007-01-24T07:29:00.000Z	keithhhhh	agent	Ill forgot about the man command
2007-01-24T07:29:00.000Z	keithhhhh	agent	btw what does the -rf stand for?
2007-01-24T07:30:00.000Z	agent	keithhhhh	no you won't man = manual and you can man almost any program... try man tr or man ls or man rm or man rmdir or man cp, etc. heck, even man man works!
2007-01-24T07:30:00.000Z	agent	keithhhhh	-r is recursive and -f is force.... read the man page!
2007-01-24T07:31:00.000Z	agent	keithhhhh	almost any question you may have regarding a program switch and how to use it can be answered by readin the correct man page
