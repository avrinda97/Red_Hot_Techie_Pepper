2006-10-14T09:18:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	thompa	Check the permissions of /media/SATA
2006-10-14T09:19:00.000Z	thompa	ianmacgregor	owner is root
2006-10-14T09:19:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	thompa	Ok, then you can add files using sudo cp or you can change perms of that dir and add files as user
2006-10-14T09:20:00.000Z	thompa	ianmacgregor	how do i change permissions to it?
2006-10-14T09:21:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	thompa	sudo chown -R <user>:<group> /media/SATA
2006-10-14T09:22:00.000Z	thompa	ianmacgregor	ok
2006-10-14T09:22:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	thompa	You rarely have to reboot for much of anything short of loading a new kernel
2006-10-14T09:27:00.000Z	thompa	ianmacgregor	 i cant find the users group with chmod
2006-10-14T09:29:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	thompa	you can just use yourusername:yourusername since there is already a group set up for you
2006-10-14T09:30:00.000Z	thompa	ianmacgregor	hey that just worked, though the 250G drive syas its only 132G
2006-10-14T09:31:00.000Z	thompa	ianmacgregor	maybe i will reformat it, its a storage drive, gparted was not working too well
2006-10-14T09:32:00.000Z	thompa	ianmacgregor	gparted says its ext3 323G, but gnome file manager says 132G
2006-10-14T09:32:00.000Z	thompa	ianmacgregor	* 232G
2006-10-14T09:32:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	thompa	I don't know much about gparted :(
2006-10-14T09:33:00.000Z	thompa	ianmacgregor	is it ok to use jfs
2006-10-14T09:33:00.000Z	thompa	ianmacgregor	thanks for getting my permissions fixed anyway
2006-10-14T09:33:00.000Z	ianmacgregor	thompa	You're welcome :)
