2008-08-21T10:43:00.000Z	Jordan_U	abe3k	##windows
2008-08-21T10:46:00.000Z	Jordan_U	abe3k	I don't know what it's called in Vista but in compiz it's called ( obscurely ) "blur" :)
2008-08-21T10:47:00.000Z	Jordan_U	abe3k	You may also want to look into emerald theme manager
2008-08-21T10:47:00.000Z	abe3k	Jordan_U	: that effect blurrs the whole window
2008-08-21T10:47:00.000Z	abe3k	Jordan_U	: emerald has that blur effect ?
2008-08-21T10:49:00.000Z	Jordan_U	abe3k	Emerald has the ability to make me think that my glasses are smudged, but only around the border / title of the window ( called window decoration in *NIX speak ) if that's what you mean then yes, there are also vista themes for emerald so if that's not what you are talking about just get one of those and see what option it uses :)
2008-08-21T10:49:00.000Z	abe3k	Jordan_U	: thanks alot I'll search that up :)
2008-08-21T10:51:00.000Z	Jordan_U	abe3k	I personally hate it, but again the first time I saw Vista I thought my glasses were smudged, maybe for someone who has dirty glasses less often it's not as annoying :)
2008-08-21T10:53:00.000Z	abe3k	Jordan_U	:  It worked !, seems that I have to turn the blur option in compiz for the effect to work correctly in emerald :D
2008-08-21T11:40:00.000Z	Jordan_U	abe3k	Describe the effect, what does it do?
2008-08-21T11:40:00.000Z	abe3k	Jordan_U	I grab a window, drag it for a little while and leave it move then it stops by itself
2008-08-21T11:41:00.000Z	abe3k	Jordan_U	kinda like throwing the windows from place to place
2008-08-21T11:41:00.000Z	Jordan_U	abe3k	Wobbly windows does that, but also makes your windows wobbly :) I don't know if there is a plugin that just does that but I would expect there is
2008-08-21T11:42:00.000Z	abe3k	Jordan_U	I liked the wobbly window throw method but the window moves only for a short distance
2008-08-21T11:43:00.000Z	Jordan_U	abe3k	Have you tried changing the viscosity and other settings in ccsm ?
2008-08-21T11:44:00.000Z	abe3k	Jordan_U	yeah tried changing the parameters but nothing extended the distance :(
2008-08-21T11:51:00.000Z	Jordan_U	abe3k	Possibly check out mouse gestures
