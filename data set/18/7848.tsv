2007-11-05T05:32:00.000Z	filloy	Alyxander	uhhh, whats hose? sorry, bad english
2007-11-05T05:34:00.000Z	Alyxander	filloy	sorry does the system stop when you plug the pci in after its booted?
2007-11-05T05:34:00.000Z	Alyxander	filloy	if not do an lspci and see if it recognizes it
2007-11-05T05:36:00.000Z	filloy	Alyxander	The system freezes if I plug the PCI card and then boot, the message thats being displayed is Starting Common Unix Printing Service: cupsd...which has nothing to do with the wireless card, but the strange this is that if I unplug the card and then start the computer, the cupsd has no problems :s
2007-11-05T05:38:00.000Z	Alyxander	filloy	humm what kind of wireless card is it
2007-11-05T05:38:00.000Z	filloy	Alyxander	Its an Encore Wirless-g PCI, model ENLWI-G2 with a Realtek RTL8185L chipset
2007-11-05T05:38:00.000Z	Alyxander	filloy	is it supported?
2007-11-05T05:39:00.000Z	filloy	Alyxander	ive read in many pages that the Realtek and this particular card is known to work
2007-11-05T05:43:00.000Z	Alyxander	filloy	have you installed the drivers and hit f2 during boot to see the full post so you can identify the error
