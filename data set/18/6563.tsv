2008-05-04T13:31:00.000Z	fde	prince_jammys	It is working now, please don't confuse him more  :)
2008-05-04T13:31:00.000Z	prince_jammys	fde	what's working now?
2008-05-04T13:31:00.000Z	fde	prince_jammys	He is installing the Ubuntu version of Thunderbird.
2009-02-17T15:59:00.000Z	fde	prince_jammys	I always get that muggled until I actually do it.. lol
2009-02-17T15:59:00.000Z	prince_jammys	fde	:)
2009-02-17T15:59:00.000Z	prince_jammys	fde	try this; echo (and now type alt { )
2009-02-17T18:25:00.000Z	prince_jammys	fde	it seems that packages have to ensure that ucf knows to purge the conf once the package is purged (this from man ucf). perhaps what you're describing was a bug in certain packages' postrm scripts?
2009-02-17T18:25:00.000Z	prince_jammys	fde	else it's believed to still be in the system and doesn't get created on reinstall
2009-02-17T18:25:00.000Z	fde	prince_jammys	it is certainly not a bug, its just that a lot of people run into the negative aspects of it.
2009-02-17T18:37:00.000Z	prince_jammys	fde	i don't know why you're rulling out the ucf problem i mentioned. i see a lot of bug reports for packages that fail to take care of that when purged, so the conf files don't get created on reinstall.
2009-02-17T18:37:00.000Z	prince_jammys	fde	ruling out, it meant.
2009-02-17T18:38:00.000Z	fde	prince_jammys	I think you're misinterpreting the issue though... the postrm script could be wrong also, but postinst will be what has checked to see if the user has removed the file or changed it.
2009-02-17T18:45:00.000Z	prince_jammys	fde	when you get a chance, this short bug report is what is was talking about, which sounds like what you were describing:  http://www.mail-archive.com/debian-bugs-dist@lists.debian.org/msg89865.html
2009-02-17T18:48:00.000Z	fde	prince_jammys	perhaps, but I can't see Brandon (xorg packager in debian) making such a trivial mistake... hmm
2009-02-17T18:48:00.000Z	prince_jammys	fde	true
2009-02-17T21:21:00.000Z	fde	prince_jammys	she wants to not touch her windows partitions... which is basically the point of wubi  :) (it creates a virtual disk which ends up being dual bootable)
2009-02-17T21:24:00.000Z	prince_jammys	fde	it appears that she wants to install it in its own partition
2009-02-17T21:25:00.000Z	fde	prince_jammys	ahh, yes, her new wording does seem that way... my bad
