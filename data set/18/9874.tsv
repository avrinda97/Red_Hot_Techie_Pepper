2007-02-08T12:57:00.000Z	Jordan_U	viniciusf	Can you pastebin your xorg.conf?
2007-02-08T13:02:00.000Z	viniciusf	Jordan_U	: http://pastebin.com/878043 <- i replaced "nvidia" with "nv" to get here
2007-02-08T13:03:00.000Z	Jordan_U	viniciusf	try: sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg -phigh and when it asks you what driver to use, choose nvidia
2007-02-08T13:10:00.000Z	viniciusf	Jordan_U	: i will restart now to see if works, thanks man!
2007-02-08T13:11:00.000Z	Jordan_U	viniciusf	You don't need to fully restart, just restart X using ctrl+alt+backspace
2007-02-08T13:12:00.000Z	viniciusf	Jordan_U	i know, but thanks again :)
2007-02-08T13:15:00.000Z	viniciusf	Jordan_U	it didnt work, and now my keyboard layout is kinda strange
2007-02-08T13:16:00.000Z	Jordan_U	viniciusf	Ok, in what was does it not work? does X start at all?
2007-02-08T13:17:00.000Z	viniciusf	Jordan_U	no, i cant start x in any way with that settings
2007-02-08T13:17:00.000Z	Jordan_U	viniciusf	What happens when you try to run: sudo modprobe nvidia
2007-02-08T13:17:00.000Z	viniciusf	Jordan_U	let me see...
2007-02-08T13:18:00.000Z	viniciusf	Jordan_U	`FATAL: Could not open '/lib/modules/2.6.17-10-generic/volatile/nvidia.ko': No such file or directory`
2007-02-08T13:20:00.000Z	Jordan_U	viniciusf	Ok, sudo apt-get install nvidia-glx.
2007-02-08T13:22:00.000Z	viniciusf	Jordan_U	sorry if i dont previously explained how the mess started (i dont speak english), i got nvidia beta drivers from the official site some months ago, and it was doing nice until an upgrade on the l-r-m that i made today. on the nvidia foruns sys that l-r-m should be uninstalled on ubuntu, or manually edit /etc/defaults/linux-restricted-modules to disabele_modules=nv
2007-02-08T13:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U	viniciusf	I don't know anything about the Beta drivers, I would try getting help in #beryl as the people there are likely to be using the beta drivers
2007-02-08T13:24:00.000Z	viniciusf	Jordan_U	ok, thanks again
