2006-06-07T13:56:00.000Z	ic56	ehaase	try sudo grep -i nautilus /var/log/*
2006-06-07T13:56:00.000Z	ic56	ehaase	any error messages there?
2006-06-07T13:59:00.000Z	ehaase	ic56	ok, thats really starnge, i rebooted and now it works fine... could it possible be bad sectors?
2006-06-07T14:00:00.000Z	ehaase	ic56	i have reason to believe i have bad sectors on my other partition for the same harddrive on windows...
2006-06-07T14:01:00.000Z	ic56	ehaase	while things can get really hairy with bad drives, I don't think it likely that this is the case here.
2006-06-07T14:01:00.000Z	ehaase	ic56	how come?
2006-06-07T14:01:00.000Z	ehaase	ic56	because i've troubleshooted the problem to that conclusion on my windows partition (same drive) and i'm going to do a complete scan disk tonight...
2006-06-07T14:04:00.000Z	ic56	ehaase	I don't know the complete history so it's better I not comment.  Did the problem on the Windows side go away, the way it did in Ubuntu?
2006-06-07T14:06:00.000Z	ehaase	ic56	well, when i rebooted i stopped getting the nautilus has quit unexpectedly, but evolution now reports the quit unexpectedly error... what does that indicate?
2006-06-07T14:07:00.000Z	ic56	ehaase	I take it there was nothing relevant in /var/log ?
2006-06-07T14:07:00.000Z	ehaase	ic56	nope
2006-06-07T14:08:00.000Z	ehaase	ic56	i'm guessing bad memory now?
2006-06-07T14:08:00.000Z	ehaase	ic56	since i'm getting random 'quit unexpectedly' errors?
2006-06-07T14:08:00.000Z	ehaase	ic56	ram memory
2006-06-07T14:08:00.000Z	ic56	ehaase	yes, I'm thinking bad memory too.  Boot into memcheck and see if you get (un)lucky...
2006-06-07T14:08:00.000Z	ic56		(or is that memtest?)
2006-06-07T14:09:00.000Z	ehaase	ic56	ok, thanks for your time!
2006-06-07T14:09:00.000Z	ic56	ehaase	yw.
