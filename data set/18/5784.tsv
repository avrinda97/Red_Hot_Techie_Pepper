2009-03-17T13:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	afancy	is what Skaarj meant to sugest
2009-03-17T14:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	afancy	type ifconfig   if you have an ip you are good to go
2009-03-17T14:41:00.000Z	afancy	ActionParsnip1	i have type ifconfig but it doesnt work
2009-03-17T14:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	afancy	try /sbin/ifconfig
2009-03-17T14:43:00.000Z	afancy	ActionParsnip1	i dont mean there is no ifconfig, but i have run this command it still doesnot enable the network
2009-03-17T14:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	afancy	ifconfig doesnt enable the network. Its to see if its already up and running with an ip address
2009-03-17T14:44:00.000Z	afancy	ActionParsnip1	no, it doens up
2009-03-17T14:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	afancy	try sudo ifup <network device name>
2009-03-17T14:47:00.000Z	afancy	ActionParsnip1	i have tried, but there is no network device name
2009-03-17T14:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	afancy	then you need to find out what you have
2009-03-17T14:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	afancy	try: sudo lshw -C network
2009-03-17T14:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	afancy	you need to find where ifconfig is lying so you can configure / probe your hardware
