2009-08-29T00:16:00.000Z	Basil		det: ya, if there's another way i'd be open to it
2009-08-29T00:16:00.000Z	Basil		tried copying over a boot disk image, but dunno how to put grub on it
2009-08-29T00:16:00.000Z	Basil		clarification: tried unetbootin entire livecd, then tried just a boot disk
2009-08-29T00:17:00.000Z	Basil		det: yes, a SATA HDD, originally internal to a laptop, extracted and enclosed for purposes of use on alt machine
2009-08-29T00:17:00.000Z	Basil		i intend to put it back in to boot
2009-08-29T00:18:00.000Z	Basil		that laptop does not boot from usb and has no floppy/optical
2009-08-29T00:18:00.000Z	Basil		indeed :(
2009-08-29T00:19:00.000Z	Basil		thought about network install, but dunno how to do it just using an ethernet between 2 machines
2009-08-29T00:20:00.000Z	Basil		BIOS does not support USB boot, just USB drives
2009-08-29T00:20:00.000Z	trism	Basil	for the laptop I'm using, I just ripped out the hd and put it in an enclosure and installed to that
2009-08-29T00:20:00.000Z	Basil	trism	how? im tryin to do that with unetbootin but not working
2009-08-29T00:21:00.000Z	trism	Basil	just a normal ubuntu command line install, just using the enclosed hd as a partition
2009-08-29T00:21:00.000Z	Basil	trism	won't that install it assuming the host PC's chipset and hardware?
2009-08-29T00:21:00.000Z	trism	Basil	although, all you really have to do is get grub on the hard drive and copy a kernel image over and you can boot from usb
2009-08-29T00:22:00.000Z	trism	Basil	it will leave you with some incorrect stuff like fstab that you'll need to fix
2009-08-29T00:22:00.000Z	Basil	trism	how do i install grub easily to the HDD? (say from Ubuntu on the host PC)
2009-08-29T00:23:00.000Z	trism	Basil	you can use the grub shell or grub-install to do it
2009-08-29T00:24:00.000Z	Basil	trism	alright, I'll give that a try and come back crying success or failure
