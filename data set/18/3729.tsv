2009-08-10T01:51:00.000Z	Baldrick	JONDAVIS	what process do you see at the top of the list?
2009-08-10T01:53:00.000Z	Baldrick	JONDAVIS	Under the word COMMAND there should be a program name
2009-08-10T01:55:00.000Z	Baldrick	JONDAVIS	Yes there are... my though is that the one at the top is using much more CPU than the others. What is the one at the top?
2009-08-10T01:56:00.000Z	Baldrick	JONDAVIS	what is the listed %CPU number for that program?
2009-08-10T01:57:00.000Z	Baldrick	JONDAVIS	And what percentage of CPU usage does it consume - listed under %CPU  ?
