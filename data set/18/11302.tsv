2006-10-16T14:09:00.000Z	bestadvocate		I'm trying to backup a couple hundred gigabites of files to an external harddrive.  but the when I just transfer files normally Nautilus seems to corrupt a lot of files.  Is there a safe way to copy files to my external HD?
2006-10-16T14:10:00.000Z	mnepton	bestadvocate	rsync
2006-10-16T14:11:00.000Z	bestadvocate	mnepton	thanks I'm going to go rtm
2006-10-16T14:11:00.000Z	mnepton	bestadvocate	i can give you the command you want to save time, and you can read while the backup occurs ...
2006-10-16T14:12:00.000Z	bestadvocate	mnepton	that would be awesome
2006-10-16T14:12:00.000Z	mnepton	bestadvocate	mount points/dir names of the origin and destination?
2006-10-16T14:13:00.000Z	bestadvocate	mnepton	one sec, plugging it in and looking up
2006-10-16T14:15:00.000Z	bestadvocate	mnepton	I forget exactly how to look up device name but it mounts at /media/SEA_DISK
2006-10-16T14:17:00.000Z	mnepton	bestadvocate	what about the source of the backup?
2006-10-16T14:20:00.000Z	mnepton	bestadvocate	so, you want to backup those 2 folders onto the external drive, yes?
2006-10-16T14:20:00.000Z	bestadvocate	mnepton	yes recursively
2006-10-16T14:20:00.000Z	mnepton	bestadvocate	you'll either have to use 2 rsync commands, put those two folders in a single folder by themselves, or back up your einter home dir.
2006-10-16T14:20:00.000Z	mnepton	bestadvocate	which makes the most sense to you?
2006-10-16T14:21:00.000Z	bestadvocate	mnepton	two commands would be better, thanks
2006-10-16T14:22:00.000Z	mnepton	bestadvocate	rsync -a -v /media/hdb1/home/bestadvocate/folder1/ /media/SEA_DISK/
2006-10-16T14:22:00.000Z	mnepton	bestadvocate	repeat that, substituting the second folder name
2006-10-16T14:23:00.000Z	mnepton	bestadvocate	my PayPal address is ... ;)
