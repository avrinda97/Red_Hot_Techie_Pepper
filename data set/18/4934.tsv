2009-01-11T06:06:00.000Z	crazyryan		I understand, but it is very busy in here.
2009-01-11T06:07:00.000Z	crazyryan		Just wanted to be heard, sorry.
2009-01-11T06:07:00.000Z	crazyryan		The wheel group?
2009-01-11T06:07:00.000Z	crazyryan		(First time using Ubuntu)
2009-01-11T06:08:00.000Z	crazyryan		main group: admin
2009-01-11T06:09:00.000Z	nickrud	crazyryan	in a terminal, type   groups  . You should see admin in the list you get back
2009-01-11T06:09:00.000Z	crazyryan		it returns admin
2009-01-11T06:12:00.000Z	crazyryan	nickrud	i got admin back... is that good or bad?
2009-01-11T06:13:00.000Z	nickrud	crazyryan	that's good, in that you're in the right group; odd, that you can't access services. Try system->admin->software sources
2009-01-11T06:13:00.000Z	nickrud	crazyryan	do you get a dialog asking for your password?
2009-01-11T06:14:00.000Z	crazyryan		Software sources gives me a dialog
2009-01-11T06:14:00.000Z	crazyryan		i put in my password and that worked
2009-01-11T06:14:00.000Z	crazyryan		still cant access services tho
2009-01-11T06:14:00.000Z	nickrud	crazyryan	then the sudo subsystem is working. I'm not sure about why the button would be greyed out ....
2009-01-11T06:17:00.000Z	nickrud	crazyryan	that's part of the policykit authorization system, which I'm not familiar with, sorry
