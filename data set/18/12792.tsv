2006-07-19T09:48:00.000Z	morphix	gr33npho3nix	well i cant get any network activity with those default bcm43xx drivers.. hell annoying
2006-07-19T09:41:00.000Z	gr33npho3nix	morphix	i have some linksys drivers that might work for you w\ ndiswrapper
2006-07-19T09:45:00.000Z	gr33npho3nix	morphix	no for bcm43xx
2006-07-19T09:46:00.000Z	gr33npho3nix	morphix	i am at work right now but if you want to pm me i can find a guide for you later
2006-07-19T09:46:00.000Z	morphix	gr33npho3nix	i mean do i need the firmware for ndiswrapper?
2006-07-19T09:46:00.000Z	gr33npho3nix	morphix	ndiswrapper needs windows drivers
2006-07-19T09:46:00.000Z	gr33npho3nix	morphix	bcm4xx needs firmware cut from windows drivers
2006-07-19T09:46:00.000Z	morphix	gr33npho3nix	i found a guide.. and am downloading the firmware now.. but under the capture.. is says they were unsuccessful
2006-07-19T09:47:00.000Z	gr33npho3nix	morphix	someone packaged it somewhere , but its not in any of the repos
2006-07-19T09:47:00.000Z	gr33npho3nix	morphix	packet capture? i wouldn't be surprised the bcm43xx driver isn't really poslished yet
2006-07-19T09:49:00.000Z	gr33npho3nix	morphix	i had some issues w\ them too
2006-07-19T09:50:00.000Z	gr33npho3nix	morphix	pm me and in 5 hours when i get home from work i'll get you the linksys drivers i use for my chipset that work spectacular w\ ndiswrapper
2006-07-19T09:50:00.000Z	gr33npho3nix	morphix	same chipset, just in a dell card
2006-07-19T09:59:00.000Z	morphix	gr33npho3nix	does those drivers allow u to use airodump, etc ??
2006-07-19T10:01:00.000Z	gr33npho3nix	morphix	i don't know
2006-07-19T10:01:00.000Z	gr33npho3nix	morphix	ndiswrapper definately wouldn't
2006-07-19T10:02:00.000Z	morphix	gr33npho3nix	damn.. well that was the whole point of getting this wireless card.. i was told this buffalo card.. and buffalo cards in general had heaps good linux support and worked in airodump, etc
