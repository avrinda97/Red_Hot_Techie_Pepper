2008-12-09T00:21:00.000Z	comicinker		when I try to login into a www-server via ssh, I receive the error message "Could not chdir to home directory ....". How can I immidiately change to /www ?
2008-12-09T00:21:00.000Z	joaopinto	comicinker	cd /www ?
2008-12-09T00:22:00.000Z	joaopinto	comicinker	cd /www
2008-12-09T00:22:00.000Z	joaopinto	comicinker	assuming you do get a login prompt
2008-12-09T00:23:00.000Z	joaopinto	comicinker	if you do not, you can't fix it, you will need to login with another user, or doing a local login
2008-12-09T00:23:00.000Z	comicinker	joaopinto	yes. I am. ssh user@server.com 'cd /www' doesn't help
2008-12-09T00:23:00.000Z	joaopinto	comicinker	if ssh is kicking you on login, it's because for security reasons it requires you to have an existing home dir, and you can't workaround that
2008-12-09T00:25:00.000Z	comicinker	joaopinto	If I use a gui for file management, I can login because I can change the default directory when logging in.
2008-12-09T00:25:00.000Z	joaopinto	comicinker	you mean an ftp client ?
2008-12-09T00:25:00.000Z	comicinker	joaopinto	yes
2008-12-09T00:26:00.000Z	joaopinto	comicinker	ftp does not relay on ssh for the authentication, your ftp server may allows you to login regardless if you have an home dir or not, that does not mean sshd will do it
2008-12-09T00:26:00.000Z	comicinker	joaopinto	I see
2008-12-09T00:27:00.000Z	comicinker	joaopinto	but maybe I can modify the ~/.ssh/config for this host to specify a default directory ?
2008-12-09T00:28:00.000Z	joaopinto	comicinker	why dont you just create the home directory for the user ?
2008-12-09T00:28:00.000Z	joaopinto	comicinker	you canÂ«t change ~/.ssh, if there is no ~
2008-12-09T00:28:00.000Z	joaopinto	comicinker	it's a server side config, not client side
2008-12-09T00:28:00.000Z	comicinker	joaopinto	no, client side
2008-12-09T00:29:00.000Z	comicinker	joaopinto	the .ssh/config can be used also for client side config (or maybe only)
