2009-01-08T13:34:00.000Z	Kunin		seriously... does anyone know how to stop it from thinking the windows/super key is pressed?  Using 8.10
2009-01-08T13:35:00.000Z	Kunin		Josh I use the super key, but right now it thinks it's pressed so I can't do anything
2009-01-08T13:35:00.000Z	Kunin		actionparsnip: No, doesn't unpress and there isn't a correct layout (MX5500 keyboard) but under 8.04 the generic 105 key worked fine
2009-01-08T13:37:00.000Z	Kunin		actionparsnip right, that's why there's is a huge list of layouts based off keyboard model?
2009-01-08T13:38:00.000Z	Kunin		I can't TYPE
2009-01-08T13:39:00.000Z	adam7	Kunin	is this on a laptop?
2009-01-08T13:39:00.000Z	Kunin	adam7	no, desktop I just upgraded to 8.10, everything worked fine under 8.04
2009-01-08T13:40:00.000Z	adam7	Kunin	do you have any other operating systems on that computer?
2009-01-08T13:40:00.000Z	Kunin	adam7	no
2009-01-08T13:40:00.000Z	adam7	Kunin	do you have an ubuntu live cd?
2009-01-08T13:41:00.000Z	Kunin	adam7	I do, where I tried 8.10 before installing and it worked fine, worked fine for a while after the upgrade as well, then all of the sudden this happened (doesn't happen at the login screen, just a few minutes after logging in)
2009-01-08T13:41:00.000Z	adam7	Kunin	stick the cd in, boot, and if you have the same problem it's probably the keyboard
2009-01-08T13:42:00.000Z	Kunin	adam7	as I said, it worked fine with the cd, and worked fine right after the upgrade, it just started happening
2009-01-08T13:59:00.000Z	adam7	Kunin	have you tried hte livecd since you've had this problem?
2009-01-08T14:37:00.000Z	Kunin	adam7	To confirm (again), live cd keyboard functions as expected
2009-01-08T16:34:00.000Z	Kunin	adam7	you still here?
2009-01-08T18:27:00.000Z	Kunin	adam7	If you remember my screwy keyboard issue from before, jrib figured it out... apparently something was messed up in my gconf settings, clearing it fixed it all!
2009-01-08T18:27:00.000Z	adam7	Kunin	ok, good to know
