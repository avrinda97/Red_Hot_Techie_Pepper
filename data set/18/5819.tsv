2008-09-30T06:46:00.000Z	smelian		hello guys i have problem with my usb modem and cd rom when i connect them they dont show in /media or desktop but in emsg i find them  but when i connect usb flash memory its detect it and can check the files in side it
2008-09-30T06:46:00.000Z	airtonix	smelian	only storage devices are automounted in /media
2008-09-30T06:48:00.000Z	airtonix	smelian	your usb modem is proly not going to work...but with your cdrom drive i suggest plugging it in all by itself, and putting a cdrom in it....if that doesnt work then have it plugged in when you turn your computer on
2008-09-30T06:49:00.000Z	airtonix	smelian	can you provide a prodcut page for your modem then please
2008-09-30T06:49:00.000Z	airtonix	smelian	product/manufacturers page*
2008-09-30T06:50:00.000Z	smelian	airtonix	:http://www.bandrich.com/download03.aspx?id=2&c=25&lang=3 but im using ubuntu no drive for it
2008-09-30T06:51:00.000Z	airtonix	smelian	im looking at it now...one sec
2008-09-30T06:51:00.000Z	airtonix	smelian	as i said unless your modem uses the international standards of usb mass storage then it wont mount it without drivers
2008-09-30T06:52:00.000Z	smelian	airtonix	: aha  so i should forget about makeing it work in ubuntu >
2008-09-30T06:53:00.000Z	airtonix	smelian	that wasnt the product page...you gave me the driver page
2008-09-30T06:54:00.000Z	smelian	airtonix	: thats it http://www.bandrich.com/products03.aspx?id=2&c=25&lang=3
2008-09-30T06:55:00.000Z	airtonix	smelian	i dont see anything there about it being a storage device.
2008-09-30T06:56:00.000Z	smelian	airtonix	: so dude what i should do
2008-09-30T06:57:00.000Z	airtonix	smelian	try the eepc driver but you will have to compile the drivers most likley...can't garuntee anything, maybe you can start a protest infront of the manufactures operation
2008-09-30T06:57:00.000Z	airtonix	smelian	they are who will be responsible for getting it working in a linux flavour of your choice
2008-09-30T06:58:00.000Z	airtonix	smelian	try searching through the ubuntu wiki & forum as well for your device vendor code and product id
2008-09-30T06:59:00.000Z	airtonix	smelian	plug it in, in terminal type : lsusb, then look for the device and get more info on it with : lsusb -s vendorcode:productcode -vvv
2008-09-30T06:59:00.000Z	smelian	airtonix	: im searching  thank u man for helping
