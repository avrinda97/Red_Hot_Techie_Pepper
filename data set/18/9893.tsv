2007-02-22T15:26:00.000Z	olafski		hey guys, I'm trying to install kubuntu but somehow my system won't boot from the cd.. is there any simple bootfloppy I can use to boot from and then start the cd installation?
2007-02-22T15:27:00.000Z	Enselic	olafski	have you set CD-boot in BIOS?
2007-02-22T15:27:00.000Z	olafski	Enselic	yes
2007-02-22T15:27:00.000Z	olafski		I dunno what's wrong with it, it used to boot from cd without trouble
2007-02-22T15:27:00.000Z	olafski		I tried win98se and winME bootdisks but they all hang at some point
2007-02-22T15:28:00.000Z	olafski	Enselic	it doesn't even seem to check the cd drive
2007-02-22T15:28:00.000Z	Enselic	olafski	make sure CD boot is #1 test,

2007-02-22T15:29:00.000Z	Enselic		beasty: that wasnt for server
2007-02-22T15:29:00.000Z	Enselic		beasty: if you didnt try googling, try it ^^
2007-02-22T15:29:00.000Z	olafski	Enselic	#1 test? what is that? I have it set to first boot device, with "boot other" enabled, and it just boots windows off of the hard drive; if I disable boot other it will complain about not having a bootable device
2007-02-22T15:30:00.000Z	Enselic	olafski	if it boots windows with boot-cd in, then the BIOS settings is likely to be wrong
2007-02-22T15:31:00.000Z	olafski	Enselic	well I wouldn't know how else to set them, I remember having troubles with this before but I can't remember what they were.. gonna try disabling the harddrive altogether
2007-02-22T15:31:00.000Z	Enselic	olafski	you set to test CD before HD
2007-02-22T15:31:00.000Z	Enselic	olafski	that should do it
2007-02-22T15:32:00.000Z	olafski	Enselic	as I said, the only boot device specified in the bios is the cd
2007-02-22T15:33:00.000Z	Enselic	olafski	hmm weird, some guru will have to take over here. are you sure you save the BIOS setup?
2007-02-22T15:34:00.000Z	olafski	Enselic	aye, I dunno what the problem is :/ been doing these things for ages and somehow it's not working this time. maybe I can try a bios flash
