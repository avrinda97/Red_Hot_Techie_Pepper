2007-05-19T12:35:00.000Z	root___		hello can someone help me please...once i login in gnome, multiple gnome-screenshot applications start running until the system crashes...plus now that i am using issi.irc, \\\\\\\ these start being written on their own...anyone??
2007-05-19T12:36:00.000Z	root___		anyone????????????????????
2007-05-19T12:36:00.000Z	DuckFart	root___	: tried a different keyboard? sounds like keys are getting stuck
2007-05-19T12:36:00.000Z	root___	DuckFart	it is a laptop  and it does not happen under windows
2007-05-19T12:38:00.000Z	root___		ok another question as no one can help me...does anyone know why when i go to save something on a usb stick or a floppy, it tells me that it is copied but when i try it is has not been copied???
2007-05-19T12:38:00.000Z	DuckFart	root___	: ok. just thought I'd try the simple solution first, There could be an some form of incompatibility with special keys on your laptop,
2007-05-19T12:39:00.000Z	root___	DuckFart	this suddently happened yesterday for no reason..until then it was fine
2007-05-19T12:39:00.000Z	root___	DuckFart	i am in no mood to sit an reformat the system...it will take ages to set it up again
2007-05-19T12:40:00.000Z	DuckFart	root___	: i'm just trying to think what else it could be. It's certainly an odd problem!
2007-05-19T12:41:00.000Z	root___	DuckFart	i will try removing gnome-screensaver completely to see if it will work
2007-05-19T12:41:00.000Z	root___	DuckFart	thanx though
2007-05-19T12:41:00.000Z	DuckFart	root___	: ok, but what would gnome-screensaver have to do with it?
2007-05-19T12:41:00.000Z	root___	DuckFart	in relation to why i cannot always write on my usb stick or floppy when it says it has done so??any ideas there?
2007-05-19T12:42:00.000Z	root___	DuckFart	well that is what is running all the time..so it might have a bug or something
2007-05-19T12:42:00.000Z	root___	DuckFart	i dont know why \\\\ happens though
2007-05-19T12:42:00.000Z	DuckFart	root___	there's a delay in writing to usb sticks. wait a while before removing it.
2007-05-19T12:43:00.000Z	root___	DuckFart	ok
2007-05-19T12:45:00.000Z	DuckFart	root___	: i can't see any particular reason why gnome-screensaver is causing problems with your print-screen and \\\\\\ problem, the only thing I can think of at the moment is to select a different keyboard layout from System -> Preferences and then changing it back. It might reset keyboard problems
