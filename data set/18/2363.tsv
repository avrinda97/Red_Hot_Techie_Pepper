2010-06-15T17:42:00.000Z	pushpop		Hi All, I just installed ubuntu and I'm booting to the drive that I know I installed to but when I reboot after installation it does not load up into Unbuntu?  It's almost like it never installs grub even though I tell it too.
2010-06-15T17:43:00.000Z	pushpop		I did the guided partition
2010-06-15T17:43:00.000Z	pushpop		so I have a swap and ext partition
2010-06-15T17:43:00.000Z	pushpop		I do have a drive in the pc with NTFS on it though that I didnt partition
2010-06-15T17:44:00.000Z	kryptyk	pushpop	at the very basic level, you should have a root partition (/), swap partition, and a home partition
2010-06-15T17:45:00.000Z	kryptyk	pushpop	ext is a file system, btw - kinda like NTFS on Windows
2010-06-15T17:46:00.000Z	pushpop	kryptyk	understood, just not understand why I can boot to the drive I installed ubuntu on
2010-06-15T17:46:00.000Z	kryptyk	pushpop	Am I correct that you are dual booting with Windows then?
2010-06-15T17:47:00.000Z	pushpop		your are not, I just have files on my second hard drive from a windows computer that I would like to have on my ubuntu machine
2010-06-15T17:47:00.000Z	kryptyk	pushpop	I see
2010-06-15T17:47:00.000Z	kryptyk		And you are certain that BRUB installed to the MBR?
2010-06-15T17:47:00.000Z	pushpop	kryptyk	It asked me if I wanted to installed Grub and I of course said yes
2010-06-15T17:50:00.000Z	kryptyk	pushpop	check out this page - http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=224351
2010-06-15T17:50:00.000Z	kryptyk		That will walk you through reinstalling GRUB from the Live CD
2010-06-15T17:50:00.000Z	pushpop		ok ill check it out
2010-06-15T17:50:00.000Z	pushpop		also what is the fastest/best file system to use
2010-06-15T17:51:00.000Z	kryptyk		Everyone has there preferences - I generally run XFS
2010-06-15T17:52:00.000Z	kryptyk	pushpop	it is worth noting that FXS is a 64bit file system
