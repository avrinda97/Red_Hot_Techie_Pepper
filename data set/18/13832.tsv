2006-04-18T06:01:00.000Z	Pupeno		Is there any easy way to create filters on Thunderbird (like on Evolution and KMail: right click->filter on->from, or mailing list, or...) ?
2006-04-18T06:01:00.000Z	CosmoDad	Pupeno	yeah
2006-04-18T06:02:00.000Z	Pupeno	CosmoDad	How ?
2006-04-18T06:03:00.000Z	CosmoDad	Pupeno	Extras -> Filters...
2006-04-18T06:04:00.000Z	CosmoDad	Pupeno	or right-click on any address -> create filter from message...
2006-04-18T06:05:00.000Z	Pupeno	CosmoDad	can't it create filters on mailing list ?
2006-04-18T06:05:00.000Z	CosmoDad	Pupeno	what do you mean by that?
2006-04-18T06:05:00.000Z	CosmoDad	Pupeno	it can create filters based on a lot of conditions
2006-04-18T06:05:00.000Z	Pupeno	CosmoDad	Create on List-Id, easily.
2006-04-18T06:06:00.000Z	CosmoDad	Pupeno	I don't know what a List-Id is but I'm sure TB knows about it
2006-04-18T06:06:00.000Z	CosmoDad	Pupeno	I usually filter my mailing lists by labels in the subject
2006-04-18T06:06:00.000Z	Pupeno	CosmoDad	on Kmail or Evolution it is: Right click->Filter on->Mailing list.
2006-04-18T06:06:00.000Z	CosmoDad	Pupeno	what's a List-Id?
2006-04-18T06:06:00.000Z	Pupeno	CosmoDad	that is too unreliable, there's a List-Id header put by most mailing list engines to do filtering.
2006-04-18T06:08:00.000Z	CosmoDad	Pupeno	with TB, you can filter on anything that's part of the mail header
2006-04-18T06:09:00.000Z	CosmoDad	Pupeno	I suppose that label-id is within the header
2006-04-18T06:09:00.000Z	Pupeno	CosmoDad	I know, but the way to create filters for List-Id is like a 10 steps operation... to much for the amount of mailing lists I have.
2006-04-18T06:10:00.000Z	CosmoDad	Pupeno	it's probably more like 5 steps and there're tons of TB extensions. One might ease the procedure you seek
