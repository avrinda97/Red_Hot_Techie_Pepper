2007-12-11T09:15:00.000Z	devilsadvocate	jwd	i'll try to write an init script for it.. it certainly deserves that much attention
2007-12-11T09:16:00.000Z	devilsadvocate	jwd	direct connect. specifically a thing called verlihub
2007-12-11T09:17:00.000Z	devilsadvocate	jwd	i run the hub using a command "vh_runhub" . I need it to listen on port 411 so it has to be as root
2007-12-11T09:17:00.000Z	devilsadvocate	jwd	its a decentralized file sharing hub...
