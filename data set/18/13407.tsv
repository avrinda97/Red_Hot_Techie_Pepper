2005-12-16T08:34:00.000Z	regeya		ok.  i have my epson r800 working thanks to turboprint.  or I did.  all I did was, well, I have my printer up to do sharing, and my wife was printing from a Win98se machine and freaked out about a print job she sent to it.  I calmly shut off the printer.  I've restarted the printer, restarted cupsys, even restarted the computer, and the printer will not respond.  I've had this happen before on another printer but I don't reme
2005-12-16T08:34:00.000Z	regeya		mber what I did.  any ideas on why turning off the printer and turning it back on would cause CUPS to throw errors once a second like "E [10/Dec/2005:20:34:45 -0600]  SLPReg of "tp0" failed with status -20!
2005-12-16T08:34:00.000Z	regeya		"?
2005-12-16T08:34:00.000Z	regeya		nautilus is to GNOME what explorer is to windows.
2005-12-16T08:34:00.000Z	sethk	regeya	is it a USB printer?
2005-12-16T08:35:00.000Z	regeya	sethk	yes.
2005-12-16T08:35:00.000Z	sethk	regeya	did you reboot the machine it is connected to?
2005-12-16T08:35:00.000Z	sethk	regeya	I know that doesn't make much sense, but it sometimes works
2005-12-16T08:35:00.000Z	regeya	sethk	see above...yes.
2005-12-16T08:36:00.000Z	sethk	regeya	the only time I've seen that, I fixed it by upgrading to a newer kernel.  I don't know of a reason that could survive a reboot
2005-12-16T08:36:00.000Z	sethk	regeya	but I did have one that seemed to work (well, did work) for a long time, but it turned out to be only a random thing
2005-12-16T08:36:00.000Z	regeya	sethk	neither does anyone else on Earth, apparently.
2005-12-16T08:36:00.000Z	sethk	regeya	it would fail maybe 10, 15 times in a row, then work for a bunch of times
2005-12-16T08:37:00.000Z	sethk	regeya	anyway it went away when I got newer USB drivers on the kernel side
2005-12-22T09:27:00.000Z	sethk	regeya	make install is capable of updating grub.
2005-12-22T09:28:00.000Z	regeya	sethk	didn't realize it at the time. :-}
2006-11-07T06:32:00.000Z	sethk	regeya	that's correct, yes, freebsd netstat which was originally bsd netstat with a slight bit of added stuff, I think
2006-11-07T06:33:00.000Z	sethk	regeya	well, that's true, it isn't, even though it borrows quite a bit from it.
