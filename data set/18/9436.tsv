2007-12-14T20:53:00.000Z	erle-		so i create it and overwrite it afterwards
2007-12-14T20:53:00.000Z	erle-		file should be 20 gigs long
2007-12-14T20:54:00.000Z	erUSUL	erle-	then you need an actual big file and the bottleneck is your hd speed. writting 20 Gigs to a disk takes time
2007-12-14T20:55:00.000Z	erUSUL	erle-	if you use qemu or kvm you can use the qcow disk image format the grows as needed
2007-12-14T21:00:00.000Z	erle-	erUSUL	you don't need to do that, because linux file systems can simulate large fields of zeroes as well
2007-12-14T21:01:00.000Z	erUSUL	erle-	thanks for the info
2007-12-14T21:02:00.000Z	erle-	erUSUL	it is called sparse file - i learned it just a few minutes ago ;)
2010-02-02T19:29:00.000Z	erUSUL	erle-	the cpufreq applet does not work for you ?
2010-02-02T19:29:00.000Z	erle-	erUSUL	asks for the password every time
2010-02-02T19:31:00.000Z	erUSUL	erle-	ah ok; true ... i use ondemand and never set speed manually; sorry
2010-02-02T19:32:00.000Z	erle-	erUSUL	bat that was different before, they changed it with 8.10 or something
2010-02-02T19:32:00.000Z	erle-	erUSUL	or 9.10
2010-02-02T19:32:00.000Z	erUSUL	erle-	chan ging cpu freq allways needed sudo afaik
2010-02-02T19:33:00.000Z	erle-	erUSUL	no, there was an option "remember permission"
2010-02-02T19:33:00.000Z	erUSUL	erle-	maybe you can do something manually; policykit manages all that
2010-02-02T19:38:00.000Z	erUSUL	erle-	http://embraceubuntu.com/2005/11/04/enabling-cpu-frequency-scaling/
2010-02-02T19:38:00.000Z	erle-	erUSUL	that way too old
2010-02-02T19:39:00.000Z	erUSUL	erle-	tried the sudo dpkg-reconfigure gnome-applets ? did not work ?
