2005-02-17T12:24:00.000Z	snarky	wm_eddie	hmm something's messed up, can you help me debug this?
2005-02-17T12:25:00.000Z	wm_eddie	snarky	have you tried the OS X jar? :)
2005-02-17T12:25:00.000Z	snarky	wm_eddie	maybe i should
2005-02-17T12:26:00.000Z	snarky	wm_eddie	hmmm i'm getting the same errors
2005-02-17T12:26:00.000Z	wm_eddie	snarky	try getting the source
2005-02-17T12:27:00.000Z	snarky	wm_eddie	oh like getting the actual source?
2005-02-17T12:27:00.000Z	snarky	wm_eddie	not just the jar, k thanks man
2005-02-17T12:27:00.000Z	snarky	wm_eddie	it may also be an error in their source, would be good to point it out
2005-02-17T12:31:00.000Z	wm_eddie	snarky	java -jar OT44src.jar works
2005-02-17T12:35:00.000Z	snarky	wm_eddie	i got the same errors with that, i emailed them
2005-02-17T12:35:00.000Z	wm_eddie	snarky	what was the errors?
2005-02-17T12:36:00.000Z	snarky	wm_eddie	and a bunch more, but i figure after the first error, the rest all just went to hell
