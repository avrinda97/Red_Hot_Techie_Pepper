2010-03-16T21:07:00.000Z	Krahazik		I am new to Linux and just installed Ubuntu, how do I log into root?
2010-03-16T21:07:00.000Z	Krahazik		I need to
2010-03-16T21:07:00.000Z	Krahazik		how?
2010-03-16T21:09:00.000Z	arathald	Krahazik	if you *really* want to enable the root account, you can sudo passwd to set the password and enable the root account, but 99% of the time, sudo-ing the command you want is much better, you'll likely end up breaking something if you log into root
2010-03-16T21:09:00.000Z	arathald	Krahazik	so that's how you do it, but I very strongly advise against it
2010-03-16T21:09:00.000Z	arathald	Krahazik	sudo the command if you need to
2010-03-16T21:26:00.000Z	arathald	Krahazik	what are you trying to do?
2010-03-16T21:27:00.000Z	arathald	Krahazik	what command are you running that sudo doesn't work for?
2010-03-16T21:28:00.000Z	arathald	Krahazik	would you like to answer my question at any point?
2010-03-16T21:29:00.000Z	arathald	Krahazik	(1) i told you how, if you werent paying attention, thats your fault, (2) what command are you trying to run that sudo doesn't work with?
2010-03-16T21:30:00.000Z	arathald	Krahazik	tell me the exact command youre running
2010-03-16T21:30:00.000Z	arathald	Krahazik	being vague will not help us or you
2010-03-16T21:31:00.000Z	arathald	Krahazik	ill be back in 5 minutes, ive gotta walk to class
2010-03-16T21:31:00.000Z	arathald	Krahazik	hold that thought for a second, i think i know whats wrong
2010-03-16T21:38:00.000Z	arathald	Krahazik	ok, the problem is that you need to type ./ before the script name
2010-03-16T21:39:00.000Z	arathald	Krahazik	nothing to do with using sudo or root, you're just running the commands wrong
2010-03-16T21:39:00.000Z	arathald	Krahazik	there's also tab-completion in bash
2010-03-16T21:39:00.000Z	arathald	Krahazik	type ./ then the first few letters, then hit tab
