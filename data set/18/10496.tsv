2007-07-22T14:54:00.000Z	stefg	Enselic_	if i recall correctly, you're running gutsy. the kernel may simply have abug, so there's nothing you can do, except using a stable version
2007-07-22T14:54:00.000Z	Enselic_	stefg	I'm actually at the stable version now, but the problem persists
2007-07-22T14:55:00.000Z	stefg	Enselic_	pastebin your 'dmesg' output.
2007-07-22T14:55:00.000Z	stefg		!paste | Enselic_
2007-07-22T14:55:00.000Z	Enselic_	stefg	what really confuses me is that it worked out of the box of Gutsy previously, but suddenly stopped. THen after a reinstall, it still didin't work
2007-07-22T14:56:00.000Z	stefg	Enselic_	checked cables and connectors already?
2007-07-22T14:57:00.000Z	Enselic_	stefg	I can install e.g. Feisty using it... so the connectors must be fine
2007-07-22T14:57:00.000Z	stefg	Enselic_	so i need to look at your dmesg

2007-07-22T15:01:00.000Z	stefg	Enselic_	ATA: abnormal status 0x7F on port 0x000118ff
2007-07-22T15:02:00.000Z	Enselic_	stefg	interesting, I've tried to grep for -i cd and -i samsung
2007-07-22T15:02:00.000Z	Enselic_	stefg	thanks for spotting, now I have something to build future fix-attempts on
2007-07-22T15:03:00.000Z	stefg	Enselic_	see line 170: try pci=assign-busses as additional boot parameters in grubs menu.lst
2007-07-22T15:03:00.000Z	Enselic_	stefg	wonderful, looks very promising, thanks for being awesome! :D
2007-07-22T15:08:00.000Z	Enselic_	stefg	I suspect the conflict happend because I poked in BIOS, that would explain why it suddenly stopped working, would you agree?
2007-07-22T15:08:00.000Z	stefg	Enselic_	ohhhh yesss!
2007-07-22T15:08:00.000Z	Enselic_	stefg	or does the BIOS have nothing do do with pci?
2007-07-22T15:08:00.000Z	Enselic_	stefg	ok :)
