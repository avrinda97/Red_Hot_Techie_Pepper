2009-11-04T21:50:00.000Z	Makavel		hi guys... has any one used ubuntu on Hp Pavilion dv2 laptop?
2009-11-04T21:50:00.000Z	Makavel		The one with the new AMD Neon process
2009-11-04T21:50:00.000Z	scott_ino2	Makavel	yes
2009-11-04T21:50:00.000Z	scott_ino2		I have one
2009-11-04T21:50:00.000Z	scott_ino2		works perfectly
2009-11-04T21:50:00.000Z	Makavel		was wondering what is the performance
2009-11-04T21:51:00.000Z	Makavel	scott_ino2	how was the performance?
2009-11-04T21:51:00.000Z	scott_ino2	Makavel	it's actually not bad, I do everything I need to do on it. I wouldn't try to video encode on it though ;)
2009-11-04T21:51:00.000Z	Makavel	scott_ino2	how was the performance?
2009-11-04T21:52:00.000Z	Makavel	scott_ino2	how does it run when multiple stuff are open, say, a browser, an IDE and so on
2009-11-04T21:52:00.000Z	scott_ino2	Makavel	performance is good. compiz runs decently however maximizing/minimizing windows kinda hangs for half a second before reopening
2009-11-04T21:52:00.000Z	scott_ino2	Makavel	I use it occational for heavy graphics, desktop publishing and it runs fine. much snappier from jaunty-> karmic
2009-11-04T21:53:00.000Z	scott_ino2	Makavel	my only issue is with the graphics chip they used in it. I prefer the open source drivers as I don't get tearing issues when watching video. however the open source drivers don't have 3D yet, so it's a tradeoff
2009-11-04T21:54:00.000Z	Makavel	scott_ino2	have you used a computer with the intel atom processor? if yes, would you compare the AMD with the Intel Atom processor?
2009-11-04T21:54:00.000Z	scott_ino2	Makavel	i own a computer company and use many intel atom processor comps
2009-11-04T21:55:00.000Z	scott_ino2	Makavel	performance is comparable, pretty much the same in my opinion.
2009-11-04T21:55:00.000Z	Makavel	scott_ino2	alright... thanks scott_ino2
2009-11-04T21:56:00.000Z	scott_ino2	Makavel	np, like I said if you're considering getting this comp weigh the graphics/driver issues accordingly. I don't run compiz on my machine, however it does work.
