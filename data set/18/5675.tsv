2010-09-28T07:22:00.000Z	dublisk		Whats the best (least laggy) way to connect to ubuntu desktop from windows
2010-09-28T07:22:00.000Z	icarus-c	dublisk	SSH
2010-09-28T07:22:00.000Z	icarus-c	dublisk	ssh / xming
2010-09-28T07:23:00.000Z	icarus-c	dublisk	hence, putty/Xming  ,  enable X11 forwarding in putty
2010-09-28T07:24:00.000Z	icarus-c	dublisk	or VNC.  (run vino, a vnc server, on ubuntu)
2010-09-28T07:27:00.000Z	icarus-c	dublisk	0~1ms ?
2010-09-28T07:30:00.000Z	icarus-c	dublisk	the math is easy, basically, you are sending screen resolution times color bits times FPS size of data in a second through remote desktop.  and each TCP/IP packet is just 4K (some used for protocol data). plus a 300ms delay each packet.  so remote desktop must be lag as hell
2010-09-28T07:33:00.000Z	icarus-c	dublisk	what's the ping for
2010-09-28T07:33:00.000Z	icarus-c	dublisk	............................. you misunderstand the network thing
2010-09-28T07:33:00.000Z	icarus-c	dublisk	you want to ping your remote desktop server from your client.  not pinging freenode/ me
2010-09-28T07:34:00.000Z	icarus-c	dublisk	where is your server and your client?
2010-09-28T07:34:00.000Z	icarus-c	dublisk	home?  office? oversea?
2010-09-28T07:35:00.000Z	icarus-c	dublisk	so you should use your home machine to ping the office one (or reverse)
2010-09-28T07:36:00.000Z	icarus-c	dublisk	but that shouldn't be fast enough for smooth remote desktop anyway
2010-09-28T07:37:00.000Z	icarus-c	dublisk	but yea.. you need LAN / fibre network to use remote desktop smoothly :P
2010-09-28T07:37:00.000Z	icarus-c	dublisk	why not just ssh/terminal ?
2010-09-28T07:38:00.000Z	icarus-c	dublisk	  you sure its server is located in your city?
2010-09-28T07:39:00.000Z	icarus-c	dublisk	plenty of network speed test out there.  but you wouldn't have a sweet remote desktop experience anyway
