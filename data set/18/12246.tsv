2009-03-19T14:51:00.000Z	ocol		O.o
2009-03-19T14:51:00.000Z	ocol		Now i get it
2009-03-19T14:52:00.000Z	ocol		I was switching for ubuntu because I've noted that my computer is very slow
2009-03-19T14:52:00.000Z	ocol		And it should work smoothly with vista as I have 2,0 ghz processor and 3 gb of RAM memory, but I think my processor is jammed.
2009-03-19T14:52:00.000Z	ocol		So basicly I can't install ubuntu?
2009-03-19T14:53:00.000Z	ocol		This is a laptop.
2009-03-19T14:54:00.000Z	ocol		Ikonia: Please read the issue I noted previously :)
2009-03-19T14:54:00.000Z	ocol		Gartral: I'm running vista
2009-03-19T14:54:00.000Z	ocol		And the problem is that I can't install ubuntu at all.
2009-03-19T14:55:00.000Z	ocol		When installing it, the computer starts to shut down immedietely. It never does it in any other case.
2009-03-19T14:55:00.000Z	ikonia	ocol	does it power off ?
2009-03-19T14:53:00.000Z	ikonia	ocol	I think you're mistaken
2009-03-19T14:53:00.000Z	ikonia	ocol	that processor is more than capable
2009-03-19T14:54:00.000Z	ikonia	ocol	that dosn't change what I said
2009-03-19T14:55:00.000Z	ikonia	ocol	then it sounds like a heat alarm is shutting it down
2009-03-19T14:56:00.000Z	ikonia	ocol	ok - so you need to talk to your hardware provider to get that hardware fixed
2009-03-19T14:57:00.000Z	ikonia	ocol	it may not get stretched that hot
2009-03-19T14:58:00.000Z	ikonia	ocol	it may be a bug with the ubuntu power managment schema
