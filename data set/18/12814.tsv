2006-03-19T10:17:00.000Z	Xenguy	chuckyp	the question is breezy vs. dapper
2006-03-19T10:17:00.000Z	chuckyp	Xenguy	he's asking if its stable enough
2006-03-19T10:18:00.000Z	Xenguy	chuckyp	rather, is stable current enough I think
2006-03-20T16:05:00.000Z	chuckyp	Xenguy	I know about paste don't tell me
2006-03-20T16:05:00.000Z	Xenguy	chuckyp	then suggest pastebin perhaps?
2006-03-20T16:06:00.000Z	chuckyp	Xenguy	I didn't paste anything
2006-03-20T16:06:00.000Z	Xenguy	chuckyp	you asked for output, and it was pasted to the channel; hence my response; that is all :-)
2006-03-20T16:07:00.000Z	chuckyp	Xenguy	I didn't paste it why would you tell me how to use pastebini?
2006-03-20T16:07:00.000Z	Xenguy	chuckyp	nm
2006-03-28T06:29:00.000Z	Xenguy	chuckyp	no, you want 'Autostart' I think
2006-03-28T06:29:00.000Z	chuckyp	Xenguy	I just want to launch an application upon logging in to xfce.
2006-03-28T06:31:00.000Z	Xenguy	chuckyp	OK, well AFAIK the standard way to start stuff up in xfce4 is by putting, for example a bash script in ~/Desktop/Autostart, but feel free to try .xinitrc/.xsession to see if that works (I'm not sure it will tho)
2006-03-28T06:31:00.000Z	chuckyp	Xenguy	I'll try both.
2006-03-28T06:32:00.000Z	Xenguy	chuckyp	I'd be interested in the results you get
2006-03-28T06:32:00.000Z	chuckyp	Xenguy	i'll let you know here I have a huge update going right now.  I'll try .xinitrc first
2006-03-28T06:32:00.000Z	Xenguy	chuckyp	tx
2006-03-28T07:31:00.000Z	chuckyp	Xenguy	well neither .xinitrc or .xsession or ~/Desktop/Autostart worked  I had to add it via the autostart applications menu item.  I've done regex searches for it in my home directory and can't find where it added the comand.  But it works.
