2006-06-02T15:37:00.000Z	squall		i have again a little problem i think someone could solve it fast
2006-06-02T15:39:00.000Z	squall		i made the 2nd how to on this site "http://www.compiz.net/viewtopic.php?id=389" i added "/usr/bin/startcompiz" in the gnome session manager but 1. i dont see it when i chose a session 2. the satus in the session manager is showing a "?"
2006-06-02T15:39:00.000Z	Warbo	squall	The session preferences deal with your GNOME session, not the system. You still log into GNOME
2006-06-02T15:41:00.000Z	squall	Warbo	sry but i dont really get what you are meaning...
2006-06-02T15:42:00.000Z	Warbo	squall	You add compiz to GNOME's session preferences (so it starts when you log in), but you still choose GNOME at GDM
2006-06-02T15:44:00.000Z	squall	Warbo	so i have to chose something else like Gnome? huh? sry... and XGL dont start when i log in or i dont see it
2006-06-02T15:45:00.000Z	Warbo	squall	XGL is the actual graphics server. If you see a login screen you are running a graphics server (hopefully XGL). At the login screen (called GDM, by the way) keep it as GNOME. The only difference is that instead of using Metacity as the Window manager it will use Compiz, but it is still GNOME
2006-06-02T15:47:00.000Z	squall	Warbo	so i have to change the session from Metacity to Compiz?
2006-06-02T15:48:00.000Z	Warbo	squall	No. Leave it as GNOME. Metacity gets changed for Compiz, but that is what you did when you edited the GNOME session preferences. Log into GNOME, it is still GNOME. Compiz is not a session or a desktop environment, it is a window manager. Use GNOME!
2006-06-02T15:50:00.000Z	squall	Warbo	oh sry i know that but in the how to stands "in login manager you can now choose a session named Xgl
2006-06-02T15:52:00.000Z	Warbo	squall	The way I did it was basically: Make the link /usr/bin/X point to /usr/bin/Xgl, add a couple of lines to $HOME/.gnomerc, then restart X, log into GNOME
2006-06-02T15:53:00.000Z	squall	Warbo	well but the problem is, i want to have 2 sessions. 1 which starts with XGL and 1 which starts without xgl thats why i have chosen this how to
2006-06-02T15:53:00.000Z	Warbo	squall	I used this guide https://wiki.ubuntu.com/XglHowto
2006-06-02T15:54:00.000Z	Warbo	squall	OK, you will want to start an Xgl server and an Xorg server, each with a unique ID (like :0, :1, etc.)
2006-06-02T15:57:00.000Z	squall	Warbo	ok i'm going to test it now thx alot
2006-06-02T15:57:00.000Z	Warbo	squall	np, sorry I couldn't help a little more though
2006-06-02T15:58:00.000Z	squall	Warbo	sure you helped me =) now i have another idea how to fix it
