2009-08-13T02:49:00.000Z	Bernini		does anyone have experience with a logitech quickcam e 2500
2009-08-13T02:50:00.000Z	scott_ino	Bernini	not specifically but many logitech cams yes
2009-08-13T02:51:00.000Z	Bernini		ive installed gspca... still doesnt work... might be having conflicts with my tvcard
2009-08-13T02:51:00.000Z	Bernini	scott_ino	i think it might be competing as the video0 device... not sure or sure how to solve the problem
2009-08-13T02:52:00.000Z	scott_ino	Bernini	ahh i see, but the came works independently?
2009-08-13T02:53:00.000Z	Bernini	scott_ino	im thinking they both might be /dev/video0 by both i mean the cam and the tvcard
2009-08-13T02:54:00.000Z	scott_ino	Bernini	and it's a e2500 quickcam?
2009-08-13T02:54:00.000Z	scott_ino	Bernini	i don't even see that as a supported device on the list from linux-uvc
2009-08-13T02:55:00.000Z	Bernini	scott_ino	yeh... gspca supposedly will work with it...
2009-08-13T02:56:00.000Z	scott_ino	Bernini	i found it yeah spca
2009-08-13T02:57:00.000Z	Bernini	scott_ino	yeh i have multiple video devices though
2009-08-13T02:58:00.000Z	scott_ino	Bernini	i don't remember, and i'll try and find it but i remember reading somewhere about manually setting device IDs
2009-08-13T03:01:00.000Z	scott_ino	Bernini	this wasn't it but maybe worth a look? http://mtuxland.blogspot.com/2008/11/how-to-webcam-tv-tuner-at-same-time.html
2009-08-13T03:03:00.000Z	scott_ino	Bernini	have you looked into editing your device aliases in /etc/modprobe.conf?? I remember having to do this for conflicting network devices
2009-08-13T03:04:00.000Z	Bernini	scott_ino	not sure how to do that ill look into it
2009-08-13T03:05:00.000Z	scott_ino	Bernini	im not even really sure how newer kernels handle such things... but just something I remember from a while back
2009-08-13T03:05:00.000Z	scott_ino	Bernini	http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-hardware-18/how-can-i-assign-a-webcam-to-a-specific-devvideo-669507/
2009-08-13T03:06:00.000Z	scott_ino	Bernini	looks promising
