2006-12-05T07:44:00.000Z	frying_fish	lewyjh	no, look at the following link:
2006-12-05T07:45:00.000Z	lewyjh	frying_fish	i need a driver for my wireless network card, not my video card.
2006-12-05T07:47:00.000Z	frying_fish	lewyjh	if it has detected it as that from some command in linux already then it is working.
2006-12-05T07:48:00.000Z	lewyjh	frying_fish	that's what its detected as in "device manager"
2006-12-05T07:49:00.000Z	frying_fish	lewyjh	in which case it has already found it and you don't need a driver.
2006-12-05T07:49:00.000Z	lewyjh	frying_fish	damnit...i wish i had an easy button to get wireless internet.
2006-12-05T07:50:00.000Z	frying_fish	lewyjh	sudo apt-get install network-manager-gnome
2006-12-05T07:52:00.000Z	lewyjh	frying_fish	that's a program right?
2006-12-05T07:52:00.000Z	frying_fish	lewyjh	yeah, for easy network management for wireless.

2006-12-05T07:54:00.000Z	lewyjh	frying_fish	once i do re-log where will it be? ha

2006-12-05T07:59:00.000Z	lewyjh	frying_fish	no option.
2006-12-05T08:26:00.000Z	lewyjh	frying_fish	is there a way to check if my network card is running alright with konsol or something?
2006-12-05T08:27:00.000Z	frying_fish	lewyjh	iwconfig
2006-12-05T08:28:00.000Z	lewyjh	frying_fish	is this good or bad? eth1      IEEE 802.11b/g  ESSID:"wireless"  Nickname:"Broadcom 4318"
