2005-10-07T09:29:00.000Z	kurtbec	net10	what shared folder are you talking about?
2005-10-07T09:30:00.000Z	net10	kurtbec	we set up a folder on desktop and shared it. we can see it and open it from other workstation. but the contents of that shared folder can't be opened.
2005-10-07T09:31:00.000Z	kurtbec	net10	so we are talking a samba share?
2005-10-07T09:31:00.000Z	net10	kurtbec	yes it's a samba. we're using ubuntu 5.10.
2005-10-07T09:32:00.000Z	kurtbec	net10	trying to access it from the command line or from gui?
2005-10-07T09:32:00.000Z	net10	kurtbec	from gui.
2005-10-07T09:34:00.000Z	kurtbec	net10	gnome or kde?
2005-10-07T09:34:00.000Z	net10	kurtbec	gnome
2005-10-07T09:38:00.000Z	kurtbec	net10	have you tried going to File->Connect to Server and then choosing windows share?
