2011-11-30T08:09:00.000Z	CarlFK		JasseT: start with memtest - let it run over night.  mainly because it is very easy.
2011-11-30T08:09:00.000Z	jsass	CarlFK	I am guessing that was meant for me?
2011-11-30T08:10:00.000Z	CarlFK	jsass	ah, yes.
2011-11-30T08:10:00.000Z	CarlFK	jsass	hold shift down when you boot, it is an option off the grub menu
2011-11-30T08:11:00.000Z	CarlFK	jsass	"server" kinda imples you have a lan.  there is a way to get kernel panic stuff sent to a network port.. just a sec...
2011-11-30T08:11:00.000Z	jsass	CarlFK	any other suggestions? This would be the first time I have ever had RAM go bad on me.
2011-11-30T08:11:00.000Z	jsass	CarlFK	yeah, this is on a LAN
2011-11-30T08:12:00.000Z	CarlFK	jsass	run this on the server https://github.com/CarlFK/veyepar/blob/master/setup/pxe/shaz/var/www/lc/netcons.sh
2011-11-30T08:13:00.000Z	CarlFK	jsass	er, replace shaz with an IP/host name of another box on your lan
2011-11-30T08:13:00.000Z	CarlFK	jsass	and on that box, run: netcat -u -l -p 6666
2011-11-30T08:15:00.000Z	CarlFK	jsass	that printf "start..." will come up on the other box.  which verifies the pipe is hooked up right
2011-11-30T08:19:00.000Z	jsass	CarlFK	about this script, I am not seeing it resident in memory after running on the failing server
2011-11-30T08:19:00.000Z	jsass	CarlFK	that is to say, no ps uax |grep net returns
2011-11-30T08:20:00.000Z	CarlFK	jsass	modprobe inserts a module into the kernel.  so you won't see a process.
2011-11-30T08:20:00.000Z	jsass	CarlFK	copy that
2011-11-30T08:20:00.000Z	jsass	CarlFK	thx

2011-11-30T08:29:00.000Z	CarlFK	jsass	heh - nice one.
