2005-10-24T07:26:00.000Z	syli725		hi, i enabled DMA on /dev/dvd maunally. that is fine. but after I mount a DVD. the DMA disabled automatically. then I have to enable it again. why is like this?
2005-10-24T07:27:00.000Z	httpdss	syli725	see hdparm.conf
2005-10-24T07:28:00.000Z	syli725	httpdss	cheers. let me read it.
2005-10-24T07:28:00.000Z	syli725	httpdss	btw, where is it? i don't want to find / ...
2005-10-24T07:29:00.000Z	httpdss	syli725	it the place you will say "i want my DMA activated for the DVD at boot"
2005-10-24T07:30:00.000Z	syli725	httpdss	thank you very much. is DMA acitvated for DVD at boot safe and good to do?
2005-10-24T07:30:00.000Z	syli725	httpdss	I am find / -name hdparm.conf now...
2005-10-24T07:31:00.000Z	httpdss	syli725	its /etc/hdparm.conf
2005-10-24T07:32:00.000Z	syli725	httpdss	sorry. i don't have that file??
2005-10-24T07:32:00.000Z	syli725	httpdss	is this weird ?
2005-10-24T07:34:00.000Z	syli725	httpdss	sure, i didn't get typo errors. i just do <tan>
2005-10-24T07:35:00.000Z	syli725	httpdss	<tab>
2005-10-24T07:36:00.000Z	httpdss	syli725	its safe .. no prob to mount it with dma enabled
2005-10-24T07:37:00.000Z	httpdss	syli725	try reinstalling hdparm bcuz hdparm.conf is included on the pkg
2005-10-24T07:37:00.000Z	syli725	httpdss	Jowi, I put the line and created conf file by myself. but when I mount it, still off automatically. (i enabled it first)
2005-10-24T07:40:00.000Z	syli725	httpdss	Jowi, i will google it and try to find out why. Thank you very much. as long as DMA is safe. I am happy. :)
2005-10-24T07:41:00.000Z	httpdss	syli725	no prob .. try reinstalling before googleing
2005-10-24T07:42:00.000Z	syli725	httpdss	thanks. :)
