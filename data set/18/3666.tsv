2009-09-18T17:34:00.000Z	adalal	psinetic	if it's just an nvidia card, it should be under system > administration > hardware drivers
2009-09-18T17:35:00.000Z	adalal	psinetic	what exactly have you install so far?
2009-09-18T17:35:00.000Z	adalal	psinetic	you can also try xfix
2009-09-18T17:35:00.000Z	adalal	psinetic	yes
2009-09-18T17:35:00.000Z	adalal	psinetic	and no other drivers as such?
2009-09-18T17:36:00.000Z	adalal	psinetic	where did you download it from?
2009-09-18T17:36:00.000Z	adalal	psinetic	was it a deb file?
2009-09-18T17:38:00.000Z	adalal	psinetic	well, you can just try sudo apt-get remove <package name>
2009-09-18T17:40:00.000Z	adalal	psinetic	i believe you can still remove it with apt-get
2009-09-18T17:40:00.000Z	adalal	psinetic	sounds good :)
2009-09-18T17:41:00.000Z	adalal	psinetic	sudo reboot
2009-09-18T17:42:00.000Z	adalal	psinetic	no... you learn as you go
2009-09-18T17:42:00.000Z	adalal	psinetic	and if anything, you have the internet at your hand..
2009-09-18T17:43:00.000Z	adalal	psinetic	well, have you restarted x?
2009-09-18T17:43:00.000Z	adalal	psinetic	if it's perfect, it's good
2009-09-18T17:43:00.000Z	adalal	psinetic	probably using open source drives nless you enabled the closed source nvidia one
