2008-06-20T19:21:00.000Z	jtaby		hey, i just installed ubuntu 8, but the login i thought i used isn't working, how can I reset the username and password?
2008-06-20T19:23:00.000Z	dns53	jtaby	boot into a live cd, mount your installed drive, chroot to the place where you mounted that drive, run sudo passwd username
2008-06-20T19:24:00.000Z	jtaby	dns53	i don't have live cd, i have the alternate installer
2008-06-20T19:25:00.000Z	dns53	jtaby	even better, put that in, it gives you a recovery option, get it to mount your drive and give you a terminal, once there just run 'passwd username'
2008-06-20T19:28:00.000Z	jtaby	dns53	"rescue a broken system"?
2008-06-20T19:29:00.000Z	dns53	jtaby	yes
2008-06-20T19:29:00.000Z	jtaby	dns53	which should i use as a root file system? sda1, 2 or 5?
2008-06-20T19:30:00.000Z	dns53	jtaby	i don't know, try one, if that does not work reboot and try the other one
2008-06-20T19:31:00.000Z	jtaby	dns53	it says "unknown user jtaby"
2008-06-20T19:33:00.000Z	dns53	jtaby	have a look at the file /etc/passwd and see if that user exists
2008-06-20T19:35:00.000Z	jtaby	dns53	i couldn't find it
2008-06-20T19:36:00.000Z	dns53	jtaby	did you get it to chroot to your partition or is it still in the installer partition?
2008-06-20T19:37:00.000Z	jtaby	dns53	i got a shell with one of the filesystems mounted
2008-06-20T19:37:00.000Z	dns53	jtaby	run mount to see what is mounted, i think you need to run chroot /mnt or something like that first
2008-06-20T19:41:00.000Z	jtaby	dns53	can i add an entry to /etc/passwd and set the password for it?
2008-06-20T19:42:00.000Z	dns53	jtaby	do not edit it directly, instead use the command line tools, useradd to create a new user, passwd <user> to set the password
2008-06-20T19:44:00.000Z	dns53	jtaby	i think you are still using the installer as the root instead of your partition, try running   chroot /mnt/target or chroot /target
2008-06-20T19:45:00.000Z	jtaby	dns53	when i ran useradd, then passwd, and i tried to login, it said that it couldn't find a home directory (which is understandable)
