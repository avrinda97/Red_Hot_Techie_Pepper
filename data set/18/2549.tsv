2010-10-08T09:14:00.000Z	Ed__		Hi I just installed Ubuntu Server with VNC on my laptop, I can VNC into the laptop, however when I pull the HD out of the laptop and place it in a device with no monitor I can't VNC into it.  Does anybody have any suggestions or maybe a VNC channel I should go to?
2010-10-08T09:16:00.000Z	moetunes	Ed__	 anything in the X log give a clue?
2010-10-08T09:16:00.000Z	Ed__	moetunes	where would i find that in? var/log?
2010-10-08T09:17:00.000Z	moetunes	Ed__	 grep /var/log/Xorg.0.log for EE
2010-10-08T09:21:00.000Z	moetunes	Ed__	 if you have an xorg.conf rename it
2010-10-08T09:22:00.000Z	Ed__	moetunes	and then swap the drive again?
2010-10-08T09:23:00.000Z	moetunes	Ed__	 or logout/login
2010-10-08T09:23:00.000Z	moetunes	Ed__	 you don't have ssh for the lappy?
2010-10-08T09:24:00.000Z	moetunes	Ed__	 just don't have a xorg.conf in there and X will sort itself out
2010-10-08T09:29:00.000Z	Ed__	moetunes	I do not have an xorg.conf file
2010-10-08T09:29:00.000Z	moetunes	Ed__	 can you paste the X log?
2010-10-08T09:31:00.000Z	moetunes	Ed__	 the whole thing pls
2010-10-08T09:33:00.000Z	moetunes	Ed__	 from that little bit it seems the intel module needs a monitor connected
2010-10-08T09:34:00.000Z	moetunes	Ed__	 /usr/lib/X11/xorg.conf.d is a dir where the X settings are now - anything intel in there?
2010-10-08T09:35:00.000Z	Ed__	moetunes	that conf.d file is empty
2010-10-08T09:36:00.000Z	moetunes	Ed__	 there should be a couple of files in that dir afaik
2010-10-08T09:39:00.000Z	Ed__	moetunes	I see: start  x11perfcomp  xedit  xorg.conf.d  xsm
2010-10-08T09:39:00.000Z	moetunes	Ed__	 from a quick google the issue seems to be with using gdm for auto login - what I do is NOT use gdm and ssh to login and have vncserver start in autostarted apps
