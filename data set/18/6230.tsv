2008-12-19T04:12:00.000Z	speaker219		did you blacklist the ssb modules?
2008-12-19T04:12:00.000Z	speaker219		i'm on a 4318 w/ ndiswrapper too
2008-12-19T04:14:00.000Z	speaker219		oh
2008-12-19T04:15:00.000Z	ASULutzy	speaker219	If you're on 8.10 afaik the STA driver can work, you can toss ndiswrapper, I did on my personal laptop
2008-12-19T04:16:00.000Z	speaker219	ASULutzy	didn't want to use that driver, doesn't even support wireless G speeds, and was slower
2008-12-19T04:16:00.000Z	speaker219		afaik (when I tried it)
2008-12-19T04:16:00.000Z	ASULutzy	speaker219	Eh? I get pretty good speeds on it?
2008-12-19T04:16:00.000Z	speaker219		does it support wireless G?
2008-12-19T04:16:00.000Z	ASULutzy	speaker219	Yes
2008-12-19T04:16:00.000Z	speaker219		hm, I must've used it a long time ago then
2008-12-19T04:16:00.000Z	ASULutzy	speaker219	Yea, I run g at home, and I can stream video from my desktop to the laptop wirelessly just fine
2008-12-19T04:16:00.000Z	speaker219		wait, does it support WPA2?
2008-12-19T04:17:00.000Z	speaker219		trying to remember why i didn't use it ;p
2008-12-19T04:17:00.000Z	ASULutzy	speaker219	I believe so, and I don't know that you have to trick out WPA_SUPPLICANT
2008-12-19T04:17:00.000Z	speaker219		hmm
2008-12-19T04:20:00.000Z	ASULutzy	speaker219	Yea, I would definitely at least check it out, I've been very happy so far with it, although I must admit, I was one of the few people that didn't have that much beef with ndiswrapper, it usually worked fairly well fo rme
2008-12-19T04:20:00.000Z	ASULutzy	speaker219	Still, I'd recommend giving it a look
