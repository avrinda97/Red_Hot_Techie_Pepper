2006-11-25T17:03:00.000Z	anton_	sesamebike	how large is /dev/hda?
2006-11-25T17:03:00.000Z	sesamebike	anton_	20490559488 bytes
2006-11-25T17:04:00.000Z	anton_	sesamebike	and how  large is the image you're making now?
2006-11-25T17:04:00.000Z	anton_	sesamebike	ps. can you give me the size with -h ?
2006-11-25T17:04:00.000Z	sesamebike	anton_	4062691328 bytes and increasing. I'm just about to do a control-c
2006-11-25T17:05:00.000Z	anton_	sesamebike	hang on, i managed to work out, that the image is not 40GB large. how large is dev/hda again?
2006-11-25T17:06:00.000Z	sesamebike	anton_	20.4 GB
2006-11-25T17:06:00.000Z	anton_	sesamebike	that's wierd
2006-11-25T17:07:00.000Z	anton_	sesamebike	or is it weird? on /dev/hda you have the current rootfs?
2006-11-25T17:07:00.000Z	sesamebike	anton_	indeed. i'll abort it now and try again. it seems it's not finding EOF.
2006-11-25T17:08:00.000Z	anton_	sesamebike	i'm not sure that's the problem. if you currently have your / on /dev/hda, then /dev/sda will also be mounted somewhere on /dev/hda
2006-11-25T17:08:00.000Z	sesamebike	anton_	ahh. that could be aproblem
2006-11-25T17:08:00.000Z	anton_	sesamebike	and you're copying a copy of a copy etc
2006-11-25T17:08:00.000Z	sesamebike	anton_	is there any way around this
2006-11-25T17:08:00.000Z	anton_	sesamebike	a live cd :)
2006-11-25T17:09:00.000Z	sesamebike	anton_	i'm running with the live cd already. /dev/hda is not mounted
2006-11-25T17:10:00.000Z	anton_	sesamebike	ooh, well, then i don't understand why it doesn't work...
2006-11-25T17:10:00.000Z	sesamebike	anton_	me neither. i'll try with specifing exacly how many bytes to copy. thanks anyway
