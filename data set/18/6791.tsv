2008-04-11T17:17:00.000Z	Oprtz		 ) ?
2008-04-11T17:17:00.000Z	Lamego	Oprtz	open a terminal and run: sudo dpkg --configure -a
2008-04-11T17:18:00.000Z	Oprtz	Lamego	it says OK
2008-04-11T17:19:00.000Z	Oprtz	Lamego	 i am also not able to login on default screen asking username and password, i use failgnome session and then it let me IN, how to configure this please?
2008-04-11T17:20:00.000Z	Lamego	Oprtz	how did you get into that state ? Have you removed packages ?
2008-04-11T17:22:00.000Z	Lamego	Oprtz	if you don't know what you did to break your gnome session, it will be hard to fix it
2008-04-11T17:23:00.000Z	Oprtz	Lamego	 i get these errors in terminal now (update-initramfs: Generating /boot/initrd.img-2.6.22-14-generic
2008-04-11T17:23:00.000Z	Lamego	Oprtz	that is not an error, its a message from a package install
2008-04-11T17:24:00.000Z	Oprtz	Lamego	 we just make a new user name and then we change the resoultion of screen and thats all
2008-04-11T17:24:00.000Z	Oprtz	Lamego	 ahh ok
2008-04-11T17:24:00.000Z	Oprtz	Lamego	 so now what to do? i love ubuntu and want to use it
2008-04-11T17:24:00.000Z	Lamego	Oprtz	you did something else, installation related, creating an user and changing the resolution would not play with apt
2008-04-11T17:26:00.000Z	Oprtz	Lamego	no we only do this and then he told me to log in with failgnome session, because normal login dont work for me, bcz of my vga i think
2008-04-11T17:26:00.000Z	Oprtz	Lamego	when i log in to my username it says u want to delete some files, then i accept it
2008-04-11T17:29:00.000Z	Oprtz	Lamego	 it ask to restart my machine ? should i go for that?
2008-04-11T17:32:00.000Z	Oprtz	Lamego	 i restart my computer and now i can log in without failgnome session :) thanks for ur help
