2008-08-08T08:32:00.000Z	jay_		<--- new ubuntu user from windows, tried both Xchat and Koversation, which one is best for irc and why?
2008-08-08T08:32:00.000Z	jay_		how do you use proxy in xchat?
2008-08-08T08:33:00.000Z	jay_		like i mirc i could use a socks5
2008-08-08T08:34:00.000Z	jay_		i guess i dont like how xchat makes me click one a button to see hows all in the channel and dont see an option to use a proxy
2008-08-08T08:34:00.000Z	jay_		whos all in the channel*
2008-08-08T08:35:00.000Z	RequinB41	jay_	use pidgin
2008-08-08T08:37:00.000Z	RequinB41	jay_	you can make gimp look like photoshop
2008-08-08T08:38:00.000Z	RequinB41	jay_	No one's disguising the fact it's a different operating system - but if it wasn't different, how could it be better?
2008-08-08T08:40:00.000Z	RequinB41	jay_	you can setup a ftp or samba server on your ubuntu machine and all the computers can access it
2008-08-08T08:42:00.000Z	RequinB41	jay_	blak1's comments aren't relevent.  It's good to ask questions.
2008-08-08T08:44:00.000Z	RequinB41	jay_	and then a ftp server is - well - an ftp server for storing stuff on your network
2008-08-08T08:50:00.000Z	RequinB41	jay_	you are not the admin xD That's the beauty.  You can make yourself have admin priviledges temporarily only when you're sure you want to, and wiht a password.
2008-08-08T08:53:00.000Z	RequinB41	jay_	what SNuxoll says.  Basically, there is no need for a "exe" type designation for a few reasons, mostly because the software is installed via repositories
2008-08-08T08:56:00.000Z	RequinB41	jay_	http://linux.oneandoneis2.org/LNW.htm is perhaps one of the better reads for the transition from windows to linux
2008-08-08T08:56:00.000Z	RequinB41	jay_	keep in mind
2008-08-08T08:56:00.000Z	RequinB41	jay_	that is meant for people who are having problems in certain areas, and probably doesn't apply to you
2008-08-08T09:16:00.000Z	RequinB41	jay_	keep in mind you can run a "server" on a "desktop machine" - ubuntu doesn't see the difference - it's just a question of what programs are installed
2008-08-08T09:23:00.000Z	RequinB41	jay_	Well (indepth), when you type a command say 'apt-get' in the terminal, the shell (terminal instance) you are running searches in your $PATH for programs of that name.
