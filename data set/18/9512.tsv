2007-05-27T13:01:00.000Z	Foon		you can get a scraper for thunderbird
2007-05-27T13:03:00.000Z	Foon		the extension I use has scraper capability in it, but my hotmail account is old, so I can get my e-mail through webDAV services :)
2007-05-27T13:05:00.000Z	Foon		:)
2007-05-27T11:53:00.000Z	Foon		oi folks
2007-05-27T11:54:00.000Z	Foon		a friend of mine just told me that his fingerprint usb drive's hidden partition (with the fingerprint software on it) has been infected by a virus
2007-05-27T11:54:00.000Z	Foon		but the partition is read-only
2007-05-27T11:54:00.000Z	Foon		how would he go about making it writable?
2007-05-27T11:54:00.000Z	bbrazil	Foon	what filesystem is it?
2007-05-27T11:54:00.000Z	Foon		FAT
2007-05-27T11:55:00.000Z	Foon		not FAT32, just FAT.. so FAT16
2007-05-27T11:55:00.000Z	Foon		er, well, FAT
2007-05-27T11:55:00.000Z	Foon		anyway, yeah
2007-05-27T11:55:00.000Z	bbrazil	Foon	hmm, that should be writable without any issues. Try sudo remount -o remount,rw /mount/point
2007-05-27T11:55:00.000Z	bbrazil	Foon	bah, sudo mount -o remount,rw /mount/point
2007-05-27T11:56:00.000Z	Foon		I'll relay that to him and see what happens, but I think he said he has already tried mounting it under ubuntu
2007-05-27T12:03:00.000Z	Foon	bbrazil	I haven't gotten a reply back from him yet, but the problem is that the partition is read-only from what I understand, he can't even reformat it under windows
2007-05-27T12:03:00.000Z	Foon	bbrazil	but it's gotta be writable somehow because a virus was able to sneak on, ... so how?
2007-05-27T12:06:00.000Z	Foon	bbrazil	?
