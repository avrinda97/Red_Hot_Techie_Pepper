2007-03-31T05:08:00.000Z	etank	Pelo	everytime i login gnome-terminal starts
2007-03-31T05:08:00.000Z	Pelo	etank	 look in menu > system > prefs > sessions,  3rd tab
2007-03-31T05:08:00.000Z	etank	Pelo	i looked in sessions and it is not listed
2007-03-31T05:08:00.000Z	Pelo	etank	 look in  system > admin >  services
2007-03-31T05:09:00.000Z	etank	Pelo	i looked at some of the config files in my home dir too but didn't see it
2007-03-31T05:09:00.000Z	Pelo	etank	 a cron task ?
2007-03-31T05:10:00.000Z	etank	Pelo	no cron tasks on this system
2007-03-31T05:10:00.000Z	Pelo	etank	 I don't know then,  it has to start somewhere,    check in /etc/init.d/  see if there is something there you recognise
2007-03-31T05:11:00.000Z	etank	Pelo	i have one service named "Remote Shell Server"
2007-03-31T05:11:00.000Z	Pelo	etank	 you can try commenting it out and see what happens
2007-03-31T05:11:00.000Z	etank	Pelo	but i think that is my openssh-server service starting
2007-03-31T05:11:00.000Z	etank	Pelo	i'll give that a shot
2007-03-31T05:12:00.000Z	Pelo	etank	  I am just guessing here ,  I don'T realy know how this is happening,   I'm just giving you clues to what I know/think might be related
2007-03-31T05:12:00.000Z	etank	Pelo	could it be in one of the .folders in my home dir?
2007-03-31T05:12:00.000Z	Pelo	etank	 I donT think so but you can always check
2007-03-31T05:12:00.000Z	etank	Pelo	thanks.
