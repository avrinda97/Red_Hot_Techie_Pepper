2005-10-06T10:08:00.000Z	Pickle_Weasel		thank you
2005-10-06T10:09:00.000Z	Pickle_Weasel	brenner	no, but you can emulate it quite nicely in wine
2005-10-06T10:10:00.000Z	Pickle_Weasel		indeed, it would be better, i'm not saying use WinRAR, i'm saying it works

2005-10-06T10:15:00.000Z	Pickle_Weasel		does it? hmm
2005-10-06T10:16:00.000Z	CarlFK	Pickle_Weasel	- look at the -ai? and -ao options
