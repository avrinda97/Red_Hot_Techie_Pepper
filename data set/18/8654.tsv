2007-10-30T09:14:00.000Z	Thanatos		Do you guys know why I get this error message when I try to save onto my external HD? 'You are trying to save the file on a read-only disk. Please check that you typed the location correctly and try again.' (I am on Feisty, and already have ntfs-3g) Essentially, I'm asking: How do I turn off read-only for my external HD?

2007-10-30T09:17:00.000Z	Thanatos	MilitantPotato	Zippy2, bullgard4, racarter: After asking the same question 8 times, I get 4 responses at the same time! Gimme a sec to try it all out.
2007-10-30T09:25:00.000Z	Thanatos	MilitantPotato	chown is taking quite a while. is it converting all files to my ownership, one-by-one? Because this could take all night.
2007-10-30T09:26:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	Thanatos	it's recursive, so yes, it's going to each file.   Did you check to see if you had ownership of them before you started?
2007-10-30T09:26:00.000Z	Thanatos	MilitantPotato	No, I didn't. But it just finished. Oh, by the way? It didn't help. I still can't write into the external.
2007-10-30T09:27:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	Thanatos	You installed ntfs-config right? did you check the box to enable writing to extranal drives?
2007-10-30T09:27:00.000Z	Thanatos	MilitantPotato	Yeah I did.
2007-10-30T09:27:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	Thanatos	is it mounted?
2007-10-30T09:27:00.000Z	Thanatos	MilitantPotato	Yes.
2007-10-30T09:27:00.000Z	Thanatos	MilitantPotato	Should I reboot?
2007-10-30T09:28:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	Thanatos	may as well give it a shot.
2007-10-30T09:37:00.000Z	Thanatos	MilitantPotato	Now my harddrive doesn't even APPEAR -.-
2007-10-30T09:38:00.000Z	Thanatos	MilitantPotato	How do I get my HD to appear on my Desktop?
2007-10-30T09:38:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	Thanatos	mount it.
2007-10-30T09:39:00.000Z	Thanatos	MilitantPotato	how?
