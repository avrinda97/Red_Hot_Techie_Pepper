2006-09-16T09:12:00.000Z	inglor		but now I found out there is a kill switch that I need to turn off, the question is how
2006-09-16T09:13:00.000Z	inglor		again, same message, kill switch must be turned off, HOW
2006-09-16T09:13:00.000Z	inglor		good idea
2006-09-16T09:13:00.000Z	inglor		The last two lines were a worry, but Jacques Vuillemin suggested that Fn-F2 is the magic to turn off the Kill Switch. If this doesn't work then modify the BIOS (F2 on boot) to disable the wireless hotley. The wireless load command worked for me after Fn-F2.
2006-09-16T09:14:00.000Z	inglor		great, that bit doesn't work for me, the Fn+f2 bit doesn't work, and the BIOS has no option
2006-09-16T09:16:00.000Z	inglor		yeah, I need to get that to work too
2006-09-16T09:16:00.000Z	inglor		anyhow, someone said "I use to type "setkeycodes" command follow by pressing "Wireless Button" to make it change to rf_kill = "0"" what does he mean?
2006-09-16T09:17:00.000Z	inglor		I do have a hardware switch
2006-09-16T09:17:00.000Z	inglor		it's not working in linux
2006-09-16T09:17:00.000Z	inglor		it's Fn+F2, doesn't work in ubuntu
2006-09-16T09:18:00.000Z	sladen	inglor	what laptop is this?
2006-09-16T09:19:00.000Z	sladen	inglor	if it doesn't work, that's a bug and needs filing in the bug tracker
2006-09-16T09:19:00.000Z	sladen	inglor	/etc/acpi/asus-wireless.sh is supposed to do it
2006-09-16T09:20:00.000Z	sladen	inglor	perhaps there is a hardware switch on one of the sides of the laptop aswell (as in physical switch)
2006-09-16T09:22:00.000Z	sladen	inglor	dude, no, don't format.  that doesn't solve anything
2006-09-16T09:23:00.000Z	sladen	inglor	Ginks: I'm confused, which one of you has the Asus A5E
2006-09-16T09:24:00.000Z	sladen	inglor	can you do  'sudo acpi_listen'   and then try pressing the Fn-F2 combination
2006-09-16T09:25:00.000Z	sladen	inglor	the Unix way is to print errors, but not success
