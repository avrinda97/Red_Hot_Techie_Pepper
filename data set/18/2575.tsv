2010-05-09T10:18:00.000Z	aetaric	Gowesty1990	open terminal (if not already opened), type sudo touch /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2010-05-09T10:20:00.000Z	Gowesty1990	aetaric	ok, now what?
2010-05-09T10:21:00.000Z	aetaric	Gowesty1990	you can edit the file... type gksu gedit /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2010-05-09T10:22:00.000Z	aetaric	Gowesty1990	no clue. that depends on your setup..... i figured you knew already
2010-05-09T10:26:00.000Z	Gowesty1990	aetaric	lol, there are some examples of things to change online but I doubt that is the complete file settings
2010-05-09T10:27:00.000Z	aetaric	Gowesty1990	it doesn't need a "complete file" what are you trying to change?
2010-05-09T10:29:00.000Z	Gowesty1990	aetaric	display settings, My Dell Inspiron laptop has a chopped up screen with repeating display
2010-05-09T10:30:00.000Z	aetaric	Gowesty1990	then you need to set the screen resolution, color depth, and refresh rate.
2010-05-09T10:30:00.000Z	aetaric	Gowesty1990	you mihgt be safe booting to "repair X11" from recovery mode and
2010-05-09T10:31:00.000Z	aetaric	Gowesty1990	go from there
2010-05-09T10:55:00.000Z	Gowesty1990	aetaric	I think I just hosed Ubuntu, doesn't want to boot now
2010-05-09T10:57:00.000Z	aetaric	Gowesty1990	what did you edit?
2010-05-09T10:58:00.000Z	Gowesty1990	aetaric	xorg.conf
2010-05-09T10:59:00.000Z	aetaric	Gowesty1990	do you see grub on boot? because plymouth, the pretty purple bootsplash, would be affected by the xorg.conf file
2010-05-09T10:59:00.000Z	Gowesty1990	aetaric	stuck at Ubuntu loading screen
2010-05-09T11:00:00.000Z	aetaric	Gowesty1990	oh, or X11 won't start... ctrl+alt+F2
2010-05-09T11:01:00.000Z	Gowesty1990	aetaric	locked up, can't do anything
2010-05-09T11:06:00.000Z	Gowesty1990	aetaric	rebooted, same result
