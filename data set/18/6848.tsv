2008-04-01T06:05:00.000Z	saikor	brambo_	 looks like you've got synaptic open. Which is locking it
2008-04-01T06:05:00.000Z	brambo_	saikor	I closed synaptic...wait I'll try again
2008-04-01T06:06:00.000Z	brambo_	saikor	ok I have closed it but now I am getting a different message,  http://paste.ubuntu.com/6314/
2008-04-01T06:08:00.000Z	saikor	brambo_	I'm sorry I haven't read your original problem. Have you tried installing sun-java5-plugin through synaptic?
2008-04-01T06:09:00.000Z	brambo_	saikor	I think I have but one minute, I will double check
2008-04-01T06:10:00.000Z	brambo_	saikor	sun java 5 jdk fonts demo doc ? or just all of it?
2008-04-01T06:11:00.000Z	brambo_	saikor	should I get Java 5 or 6? I see both
2008-04-01T06:11:00.000Z	saikor	brambo_	personally I'd go for 6
2008-04-01T06:12:00.000Z	brambo_	saikor	5 and 6,  6 is just an updated version?

2008-04-01T06:21:00.000Z	brambo_	saikor	I ran into a program in Synaptic while installing Java 6...This package is an installer package, it does not actually contrain the JDK documentation.  You will need to go download one of the archives:
