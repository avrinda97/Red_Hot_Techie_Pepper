2011-01-19T22:38:00.000Z	mouka		Hi All
2011-01-19T22:39:00.000Z	mouka		I am trying to get a simple command using named pipes to work
2011-01-19T22:39:00.000Z	mouka		but my commands do not terminate
2011-01-19T22:39:00.000Z	mouka		meaning I don't get to go back to the shell after the command has completed
2011-01-19T22:39:00.000Z	mouka		anybody knows why?
2011-01-19T22:40:00.000Z	shcherbak	mouka	what is last command?
2011-01-19T22:41:00.000Z	mouka		I used the following: mkfifo my_pipe
2011-01-19T22:41:00.000Z	mouka		then I tried this command: ls -l > my_pipe
2011-01-19T22:41:00.000Z	mouka		the ls command does not exit
2011-01-19T22:41:00.000Z	mouka		I had to use ctrl+c to terminate it
2011-01-19T22:42:00.000Z	mouka		any ideas why this named pipe is not working?
2011-01-19T22:42:00.000Z	mouka	shcherbak	Any ideas?
2011-01-19T22:43:00.000Z	shcherbak	mouka	there it no exit, just feeding pipe.
2011-01-19T22:43:00.000Z	mouka	shcherbak	How do I do it then?
2011-01-19T22:43:00.000Z	mouka		I want to feed the pipe on one line, then get whatever I fed it in a different line
2011-01-19T22:44:00.000Z	shcherbak	mouka	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named_pipe
2011-01-19T22:44:00.000Z	mouka	shcherbak	How should I proceed?
