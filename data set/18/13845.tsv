2007-05-21T07:07:00.000Z	okapi		Hello To all
2007-05-21T07:08:00.000Z	okapi		I instal the Feisty on Dell latitude 600 and it is not find or recognize the pcmcia controller. Anyone can help?
2007-05-21T07:08:00.000Z	variant	okapi	how do you know it's not found/recognised?
2007-05-21T07:09:00.000Z	okapi	variant	I check on on Kinfo center
2007-05-21T07:09:00.000Z	variant	okapi	run sudo lspcmcia with a pcmcia card plugged in
2007-05-21T07:12:00.000Z	okapi	variant	here is the result socket 1 bridge:   [yenta_cardbus]      (bus ID: 0000:00:03.1) what that means?
2007-05-21T07:13:00.000Z	variant	okapi	that means that it is detected, supported and installed
2007-05-21T07:14:00.000Z	okapi	variant	that card is D-link DWL-AG660 wich is my wireless adapter but can not have it work with any wireless software
2007-05-21T07:15:00.000Z	variant	okapi	ok, the pcmcia port is supported but the card you have plugged in may not be, you probably have to use ndiswrapper for that
2007-05-21T07:15:00.000Z	variant	okapi	read that link
2007-05-21T07:16:00.000Z	okapi	variant	this card was working find on Kubuntu 6.10..
2007-05-21T07:16:00.000Z	variant	okapi	maybe it is supported then
2007-05-21T07:16:00.000Z	variant	okapi	what have you done to make it work?
2007-05-21T07:17:00.000Z	okapi	variant	on 6.10 I installed the pcmcia utility and kwave and that it.
2007-05-21T07:17:00.000Z	variant	okapi	so do that
2007-05-21T07:18:00.000Z	variant	okapi	sorry, i know nothing about kde and little about wifi
2007-05-21T07:19:00.000Z	okapi	variant	actually everything is installed as before...but no luck. I just install ndiswrapper but I have this error" E: couldn't find package ndiswrapper"
2007-05-21T07:20:00.000Z	variant	okapi	sorry, can't help you
