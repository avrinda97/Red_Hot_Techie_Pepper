2009-07-06T00:00:00.000Z	The_Cog	space_cadet	How long did you wait? Thats the first time it tries to use the net - maybe theres a network problem its timing out trying to connect to the servers?
2009-07-06T00:01:00.000Z	space_cadet	The_Cog	10 mins?
2009-07-06T00:02:00.000Z	The_Cog	space_cadet	Damn. That should be long enough.
2009-07-06T00:03:00.000Z	space_cadet	The_Cog	it hit's the mirror, then stalls at 43%
2009-07-06T00:09:00.000Z	space_cadet	The_Cog	so when i told you it stalls at 43%??  well it's been stuck there since then
2009-07-06T00:09:00.000Z	space_cadet	The_Cog	and i have asked in #vbox
2009-07-06T00:09:00.000Z	The_Cog	space_cadet	Sorry I have no ideas then.
2009-07-06T00:12:00.000Z	The_Cog	space_cadet	I think you can tell it not to sync with any mirrors - not to use the network yet.
2009-07-06T00:12:00.000Z	space_cadet	The_Cog	well i did notice it does the same thing inside live mode.. when i go to install something, it randomly freezes
