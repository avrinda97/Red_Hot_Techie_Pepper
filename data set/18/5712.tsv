2008-09-29T09:27:00.000Z	jmsthing		I tried torrents but not enough peers
2008-09-29T09:28:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	jmsthing	if you use a torrent, I think you can just put the file that you already d'led in its place, and it will just correct the corrupted parts, instead of getting the whole thing
2008-09-29T09:38:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	jmsthing	you would have to start the torrent program, then stop it, and then replace the iso that the torrent created with your old iso.  Then restart your torrent program, and ask it to recheck the file, AFAIK
