2010-03-17T08:00:00.000Z	[[thufir]]		totem can't find this codec:  "application/zip decoder"    which appears to be some kind of windows thing??
2010-03-17T08:02:00.000Z	thiefy	[[thufir]]	i thin it's just cause in order for you to get what you want, you must inst. all those other things. so it is helping you, not angering you.
2010-03-17T08:02:00.000Z	[[thufir]]	thiefy	err, it's not finding that codec,
2010-03-17T08:03:00.000Z	thiefy	[[thufir]]	what codec you need? or are you not sure?
2010-03-17T08:03:00.000Z	[[thufir]]	thiefy	I think it's at that url, however, I'm not really sure that's a codec
2010-03-17T08:06:00.000Z	thiefy	[[thufir]]	is that a link to a  video? or a link to what? i'm not sure what type of vid yer trying to play....
2010-03-17T08:06:00.000Z	[[thufir]]	thiefy	the vid has a README saying to use http://jjpeg.com/flv.html but not sure how to use it.
2010-03-17T08:08:00.000Z	thiefy	[[thufir]]	now we know what it is you want /need.
2010-03-17T08:08:00.000Z	thiefy	[[thufir]]	flv is not a virus.
2010-03-17T08:08:00.000Z	thiefy	[[thufir]]	but that site prob is.
2010-03-17T08:09:00.000Z	thiefy	[[thufir]]	you are right.
2010-03-17T08:09:00.000Z	thiefy	[[thufir]]	there is no sudo apt-get install flv.... that is not needed.
2010-03-17T08:09:00.000Z	thiefy	[[thufir]]	good job not dl'ing that shieeit fromt hat site.
2010-03-17T08:10:00.000Z	thiefy	[[thufir]]	i'll wait here.
2010-03-17T08:14:00.000Z	[[thufir]]	thiefy	it's .flv, but I think it's actually an avi.  maybe that's the problem?
2010-03-17T08:14:00.000Z	thiefy	[[thufir]]	type sudo apt-get install vlc
2010-03-17T08:14:00.000Z	thiefy	[[thufir]]	and vlc can play almost anything.
2010-03-17T08:24:00.000Z	[[thufir]]	thiefy	thanks, will try again later.
