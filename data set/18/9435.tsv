2008-01-12T04:44:00.000Z	imaginator	erle-	do you mean you don't have an option as far as display depths and sizes?
2008-01-12T04:44:00.000Z	erle-	imaginator	he does not display anything
2008-01-12T04:44:00.000Z	erle-		he only displays my laptop display

2008-01-12T04:45:00.000Z	imaginator	erle-	how are you running xrandr ?
2008-01-12T04:45:00.000Z	erle-		xrandr -q
2008-01-12T04:45:00.000Z	erle-	imaginator	to find out, which devices are plugged
2008-01-12T04:45:00.000Z	erle-		i have gutsy with intel 945GM and xserver 1.3
2008-01-12T04:45:00.000Z	erle-		everything should work fine, i intel does not lie, imaginator
2008-01-12T04:46:00.000Z	imaginator	erle-	the video card driver you have may not be compatible with the xrandr extension.
2008-01-12T04:46:00.000Z	erle-	imaginator	it is
2008-01-12T04:46:00.000Z	erle-	imaginator	there are official howtos by intel
2008-01-12T04:47:00.000Z	imaginator	erle-	oh, so are you sure you're using the proper Intel driver in your /etc/X11/xorg.conf?
2008-01-12T04:47:00.000Z	erle-	imaginator	i don't have an xorg.conf
2008-01-12T04:47:00.000Z	erle-	imaginator	the official driver by intel is free software
2008-01-12T04:47:00.000Z	imaginator	erle-	so you're trying to do a config-less X11?
2008-01-12T04:48:00.000Z	erle-	imaginator	i want to do it by randr - dynamically
