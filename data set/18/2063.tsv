2010-08-28T22:45:00.000Z	Scrumps_		Do I need to make a folder? I assumed that it would create the folder automatically.
2010-08-28T22:46:00.000Z	Scrumps_		Alright... well, after making the mount point, this popped up: http://pastebin.ca/1927849
2010-08-28T22:48:00.000Z	Scrumps_		http://pastebin.ca/1927851
2010-08-28T22:49:00.000Z	Scrumps_		Oh... I thought it was %20, alright... hold on.
2010-08-28T22:50:00.000Z	Scrumps_		Well, arrrghhh replacing it with \40 didn't work.
2010-08-28T22:50:00.000Z	Scrumps_		Yeah, there aren't any spaces.
2010-08-28T22:50:00.000Z	Scrumps_		I guess I can remove the space from the share though, it isn't that big of a deal.
2010-08-28T22:52:00.000Z	Scrumps_		Even removing the space it still brings up that error.
2010-08-28T22:53:00.000Z	Scrumps_		What do you mean? Everything is the same, I have been changing the Torrent Downloads to modify the \040 and to try to remove the space, that is it.
2010-08-28T22:53:00.000Z	Scrumps_		Yeah, I modified the share on the Windows Box too.
