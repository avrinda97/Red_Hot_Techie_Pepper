2008-06-11T02:55:00.000Z	noteventime		I'm getting "Operation not supported" errors when getting larger files from my local (to this LAN) FTP-server
2008-06-11T02:55:00.000Z	noteventime		I've tried using gftp, which works.
2008-06-11T02:56:00.000Z	noteventime		But I'd prefer to use the standard method, so I can use it to stream over the network.
2008-06-11T02:57:00.000Z	anirudh0	noteventime	something to do with the server rather than your computer?
2008-06-11T02:57:00.000Z	noteventime	anirudh0	Tried two different FTP daemons
2008-06-11T02:57:00.000Z	noteventime	anirudh0	And it works with Firefox and gftp
2008-06-11T03:03:00.000Z	anirudh0	noteventime	yes you can
2008-06-11T03:12:00.000Z	anirudh0	noteventime	that is not nevcessary
2008-06-11T03:12:00.000Z	noteventime	anirudh0	I see
2008-06-11T03:13:00.000Z	noteventime	anirudh0	It can be /dev/sdb
2008-06-11T03:13:00.000Z	anirudh0	noteventime	/dev/sdb refers to the drive..mount mounts a partition
2008-06-11T03:13:00.000Z	noteventime	anirudh0	My player is /dev/sdb too
2008-06-11T03:14:00.000Z	noteventime	anirudh0	No partitions
2008-06-11T03:14:00.000Z	anirudh0	noteventime	hmm..strange
2008-06-11T03:14:00.000Z	noteventime	anirudh0	Maybe because it's a flash drive?
2008-06-11T03:15:00.000Z	anirudh0	noteventime	all my flash drives have partition..how would i mount them otherwise
2008-06-11T03:15:00.000Z	noteventime	anirudh0	Dunno, was just an idea
2008-06-11T03:15:00.000Z	noteventime	anirudh0	Has been working fine for me though ;)
