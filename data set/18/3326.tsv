2009-10-28T13:38:00.000Z	harrison-bergero		hello all.  Im having the exact same problem that is posted here:  http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1076843
2009-10-28T13:38:00.000Z	harrison-bergero		can someone point me in the right direction, i havent found a solution that works
2009-10-28T13:40:00.000Z	knoppies	harrison-bergero	as a quick fix I would just try upload them in smaller chunks. But thats obviously the long way of going around it. I wouldnt know. I stopped trying to get windows shares working a while ago.
2009-10-28T13:40:00.000Z	knoppies	harrison-bergero	You could also use an external HDD. thats what I do nowdays.
2009-10-28T13:40:00.000Z	harrison-bergero		knoppies....so this is a known problem?
2009-10-28T13:41:00.000Z	knoppies	harrison-bergero	my problem was getting it to connect consistantly. I could either get ubuntu to see windows, or windows to see ubuntu, but never both. It would also see it now but not later.
2009-10-28T13:41:00.000Z	knoppies	harrison-bergero	so I have up on it.
2009-10-28T13:41:00.000Z	harrison-bergero		knoppies...i was pulling my hair out thinking it was a setting problem!
2009-10-28T13:41:00.000Z	knoppies	harrison-bergero	it might be, you using samba right?
2009-10-28T13:42:00.000Z	harrison-bergero	knoppies	yes
2009-10-28T13:42:00.000Z	harrison-bergero		followed the installation tutorial complete with editing the smb.conf file
2009-10-28T13:42:00.000Z	harrison-bergero		share folders on both OSes
2009-10-28T13:42:00.000Z	harrison-bergero		and no windows firewall at all
2009-10-28T13:43:00.000Z	harrison-bergero		just the oddest thing ive ever seen....windows to linux works just fine
2009-10-28T13:43:00.000Z	harrison-bergero		but the other way around continues to give a connection timed out error
2009-10-28T13:43:00.000Z	knoppies		hmm, I wouldnt know then. I would assume its got something to do with samba, but if nobody else has fixed it, then it would probably pay off to think out of the box.
2009-10-28T13:44:00.000Z	harrison-bergero		knoppies....out of the box....i have to first climb into the box to be able to think out of the box.  Im new to ubuntu
2009-10-28T13:44:00.000Z	knoppies	harrison-bergero	that makes two of us.
