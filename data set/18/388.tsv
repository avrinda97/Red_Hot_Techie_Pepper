2012-03-07T03:15:00.000Z	mneptok	johnnycr	what does "lsmod | grep rtl" output?
2012-03-07T03:19:00.000Z	johnnycr	mneptok	that command gave me no output
2012-03-07T03:19:00.000Z	mneptok	johnnycr	is this an internal card? a dongle?
2012-03-07T03:19:00.000Z	mneptok	johnnycr	have you tried having the dongle actually connected as the machine boots?
2012-03-07T03:20:00.000Z	johnnycr	mneptok	its a dongle, yes I have it connected as it boots
2012-03-07T03:20:00.000Z	mneptok	johnnycr	"uname -a" please
2012-03-07T03:21:00.000Z	johnnycr	mneptok	Linux jonathon-A740GM-M 3.0.0-16-generic #28-Ubuntu SMP Fri Jan 27 17:50:54 UTC 2012 i686 athlon i386 GNU/Linux
2012-03-07T03:22:00.000Z	mneptok	johnnycr	is that 11.04?
2012-03-07T03:22:00.000Z	johnnycr	mneptok	I'm running Lubuntu 11.10
2012-03-07T03:23:00.000Z	mneptok	johnnycr	OK, well, it's pretty clear the Linux kernel you have does not yet have a driver for that device.
2012-03-07T03:23:00.000Z	johnnycr	mneptok	so do I need to install a different OS version?
2012-03-07T03:25:00.000Z	mneptok	johnnycr	that will not help unless the mainline kernel has gotten a driver, and whatever distro you use has updated to it.
2012-03-07T03:25:00.000Z	johnnycr	mneptok	so is there a way I can upgrade/downgrade my kernel?
2012-03-07T03:25:00.000Z	mneptok	johnnycr	the easiest path is to compile the driver from Realtek yourself, or choose a dongle with better support.
2012-03-07T03:26:00.000Z	johnnycr	mneptok	is compiling a driver something that a linux noob would be able to do?
2012-03-07T03:26:00.000Z	mneptok	johnnycr	in Ubuntu kernels only get serious revision bumps with new releases. and you don;t want to run 12.04 yet on the *chance* there might be a driver by now.
2012-03-07T03:27:00.000Z	mneptok	johnnycr	if you can go with the "return and replace dongle" option i would.
2012-03-07T03:27:00.000Z	johnnycr	mneptok	alright thanks for the help
