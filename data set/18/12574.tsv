2006-04-21T12:03:00.000Z	ompaul	harisund	only within already detected ability - there may be more if you wiki.ubuntu.com/resolution
2006-04-21T12:04:00.000Z	harisund	ompaul	Ok that sounds interesting. Will have a look
2006-04-21T12:06:00.000Z	harisund	ompaul	I have everything working excellently well, and I can change the resolution through gnome-display-properties. I just want it to work using Ctrl Alt + and Ctrl Alt - too.
2006-04-21T12:07:00.000Z	harisund	ompaul	I have three !
2006-04-21T12:07:00.000Z	ompaul	harisund	I know people with 6 :-)
2006-04-21T12:07:00.000Z	ompaul	harisund	if it is not working check out your fonts and make sure gnome fonts match xserver-xorg

2006-05-11T09:36:00.000Z	ompaul	harisund	hmmm thanks for that
2006-05-11T09:36:00.000Z	harisund	ompaul	so in breezy for FlashPlayer should I install flashplugin-nonfree or should I install mozilla-flashplayer ?
2006-05-11T09:38:00.000Z	ompaul	harisund	I know little of flash, in your shoes I would do the mozilla-flashplayer
2006-05-11T09:38:00.000Z	harisund	ompaul	exactly my thoughts. Just got a bit worried that someone changed the RestrictedFormats page.
2006-05-11T09:38:00.000Z	ompaul	harisund	there have been "improvements" to the process advised by a senior developer
2006-05-11T09:39:00.000Z	harisund	ompaul	Ah I see..
2006-05-11T09:39:00.000Z	ompaul	harisund	and I trust the guy who editied it
2006-05-11T09:39:00.000Z	harisund	ompaul	Yes, and I always trust wikis. :)
