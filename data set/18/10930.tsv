2006-10-05T09:53:00.000Z	Larken		I've recently aquired a live disk from one of my teachers, and I tried to install it on an old laptop (it was dropped, spits out the OS NOT FOUND error.) I get to the Ubuntu startup and say run/install or something of the like and then it starts to boot/install. However, once it gets to "Configuring X" it seems to shut down and goes back to a blank blinking prompt. No keys then work and it has to be restarted. Any ideas?

2006-10-05T09:59:00.000Z	feross	Larken	hmm not too bad. when you boot look at the boot options, could try different video settings.

2006-10-05T10:31:00.000Z	feross	Larken	give F4 a shot on boot.
2006-10-05T10:32:00.000Z	feross	Larken	640x480x16
2006-10-05T10:38:00.000Z	feross	Larken	hmm still
2006-10-05T10:43:00.000Z	feross	Larken	The second option a Safe Graphics Mode?
2006-10-05T10:48:00.000Z	feross	Larken	there's probably a way to start the boot cd without X but I think if the boot CD doesn't detect your screen it's going to be a bit of a hassle to get it setup. It's probably some issue with the video card.
2006-10-05T10:50:00.000Z	feross	Larken	sure
