2010-01-12T03:12:00.000Z	minimec	m0ar	can you ping www.google.com with its ip-adress 209.85.129.103?
2010-01-12T03:12:00.000Z	m0ar	minimec	Still, on windoose atm :(
2010-01-12T03:15:00.000Z	minimec	m0ar	My question goes in this direction. Could it be a problem with the nameservers?
2010-01-12T03:15:00.000Z	m0ar	minimec	Idk really. The resolv.conf is wiped clean, I tried to set my openDNS-server in nm-applet, but resolv is still empty.
2010-01-12T03:18:00.000Z	minimec	m0ar	Ok. there should be an entry like nameserver 192.168.1.1 (I use my router as nameserver, which is probably default, if you do nothing.
2010-01-12T03:19:00.000Z	m0ar	minimec	Tried to set nm-applet to DHCP, didn't work
2010-01-12T03:19:00.000Z	minimec	m0ar	Otherwise you can set a nameserver manually in /etc/resolv.conf or in the settings of the network-manager
2010-01-12T03:20:00.000Z	m0ar	minimec	How to format that in resolv.conf? :)
2010-01-12T03:20:00.000Z	m0ar	minimec	I think it's the network-mangler that IS the problem
2010-01-12T03:21:00.000Z	minimec	m0ar	nameserver xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx ... That's all. It will be gone, after reboot.
2010-01-12T03:21:00.000Z	m0ar	minimec	Uglysolution is sudo chattr +i ;)
2010-01-12T03:21:00.000Z	m0ar	minimec	I'll try that and get back in here. Thanks for the help, appreciated
2010-01-12T03:22:00.000Z	minimec	m0ar	Otherwise... Try the solution in the network-manager
2010-01-12T03:22:00.000Z	m0ar	minimec	Already done, didn't work :(
2010-01-12T03:23:00.000Z	minimec	m0ar	If you do nothing, your computer will use the router as nameserver, I guess...
2010-01-12T03:24:00.000Z	m0ar	minimec	Well, trying to set nm-applet to "Automatically (DHCP)" had no effect at all so :D
2010-01-12T03:24:00.000Z	m0ar	minimec	brb
2010-01-12T03:24:00.000Z	minimec	m0ar	ok
