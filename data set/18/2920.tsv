2010-01-26T00:53:00.000Z	luisgmarine		hey guys if I want to install a new nvidia card, is there a chance of messing up my system if I just plug it in and boot up?
2010-01-26T00:54:00.000Z	AndreMorro[BR]	luisgmarine	usually just plugin and boot-up, dont forget to install the drivers after booting
2010-01-26T00:54:00.000Z	luisgmarine	AndreMorro[BR]	ok.  just asking because I think my DVI port on my monitor is broken.  Ubuntu doesn't seem to detect my monitor using DVI but it can detect it when I  use RBG.  I bought a new 1GB 250OC video card hoping that might fix the problem
2010-01-26T00:55:00.000Z	luisgmarine	AndreMorro[BR]	I already have an nvidia card installed with the 185 driver.  Should I do anything to it before I install the new video card?
2010-01-26T00:55:00.000Z	AndreMorro[BR]	luisgmarine	you're swapping from nvndia to nvidia?
2010-01-26T00:56:00.000Z	luisgmarine	AndreMorro[BR]	yeah.  I"m switching my 8800GTX for a GTS 250 OC
2010-01-26T00:56:00.000Z	AndreMorro[BR]	luisgmarine	I would recomend you to remove the actual drivers (nvidia-180 I guess) then swapping and adding the new one (196 i guess)
2010-01-26T00:57:00.000Z	luisgmarine	AndreMorro[BR]	are the 196 in the repos?
2010-01-26T00:57:00.000Z	AndreMorro[BR]	luisgmarine	not sure... thats why I said that
2010-01-26T00:58:00.000Z	AndreMorro[BR]	luisgmarine	the most recent is 185 in the repos
2010-01-26T00:58:00.000Z	AndreMorro[BR]	luisgmarine	you can do by hand...
2010-01-26T00:58:00.000Z	luisgmarine	AndreMorro[BR]	yeah I've done it before.  But I'm wondering if that could be the cause of Ubuntu not recognizing my monitor in DVI mode
2010-01-26T00:58:00.000Z	AndreMorro[BR]	luisgmarine	its possible, cant be sure till you tested
2010-01-26T00:58:00.000Z	luisgmarine	AndreMorro[BR]	I need to find someone else with a DVI port on their computer to hook up to my monitor so that I can know for sure my monitor is not the one at fault.
2010-01-26T00:59:00.000Z	luisgmarine	AndreMorro[BR]	ok I'm just going to shut off my computer, swap out the video cards and hope for th ebest
2010-01-26T00:59:00.000Z	AndreMorro[BR]	luisgmarine	good look, tell us back the results
2010-01-26T01:14:00.000Z	luisgmarine	AndreMorro[BR]	sweet everything seems to be working great, now I just have to try my connecti via a DVI cable and see if that might work =\
2010-01-26T01:16:00.000Z	AndreMorro[BR]	luisgmarine	great
