2007-05-24T09:56:00.000Z	mike01		so how do i get my sound working?
2007-05-24T09:56:00.000Z	mike01		its broken
2007-05-24T09:57:00.000Z	mike01		i dont think anyone else has the same problem
2007-05-24T09:57:00.000Z	mike01		i believe it is caused by my ati hdtv wonder card
2007-05-24T09:57:00.000Z	mike01		for some reason linux thinks its a real sound card
2007-05-24T09:57:00.000Z	mike01		and it gets selected over my nforce 4 audio
2007-05-24T09:57:00.000Z	crimsun	mike01	asoundconf list
2007-05-24T09:58:00.000Z	crimsun	mike01	(tell me the output from that command)
2007-05-24T09:58:00.000Z	crimsun	mike01	did you manually create /etc/asound.conf and/or ~/.asoundrc* ?
2007-05-24T09:59:00.000Z	crimsun	mike01	that's not good enough. Check.
2007-05-24T10:01:00.000Z	crimsun	mike01	remove them both.
2007-05-24T10:01:00.000Z	crimsun	mike01	also remove /etc/asound.conf if it exists
2007-05-24T10:03:00.000Z	crimsun	mike01	no, we need to check other apps' settings.
2007-05-24T10:03:00.000Z	crimsun	mike01	first, for xmms's alsa output plugin preferences, what is the virtual device selected? Make sure it's 'default', not 'hw:*'
2007-05-24T10:03:00.000Z	crimsun	mike01	that's the precise problem.
2007-05-24T10:04:00.000Z	crimsun	mike01	did you restart xmms?
2007-05-24T10:04:00.000Z	crimsun	mike01	log out and back in to GNOME.
2007-05-24T10:06:00.000Z	crimsun	mike01	np
