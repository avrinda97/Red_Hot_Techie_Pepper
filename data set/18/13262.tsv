2005-12-16T10:37:00.000Z	Dewi		if I edit grub's 'menu.lst', is there anything else I have to do to make my changes take effect?
2005-12-16T10:38:00.000Z	Dewi		is there anything I can do to make ubuntu realise I have plugged in a mouse?
2005-12-16T10:38:00.000Z	beej_	Dewi	is it plugged in all the way?
2005-12-16T10:38:00.000Z	Dewi	beej_	it's a laptop
2005-12-16T10:39:00.000Z	Dewi	beej_	I have touchpad, I want mouse, so I plug it in... nothing happens
2005-12-16T10:39:00.000Z	Dewi	beej_	but if I boot with mouse in, mouse works and no touchpad
2005-12-16T10:39:00.000Z	beej_	Dewi	that might be a BIOS thing
2005-12-16T10:39:00.000Z	Dewi	beej_	it works with other operating systems
2005-12-16T10:40:00.000Z	Dewi	beej_	unless the mouse and touchpad are using different modules...
2005-12-16T10:40:00.000Z	Dewi	beej_	but then I wonder why both dont' work at once
2005-12-16T10:41:00.000Z	beej_	Dewi	I don't think they use different modules...
2005-12-16T10:41:00.000Z	Dewi	beej_	can I unload / reload the kernel module in some way/
2005-12-16T10:41:00.000Z	beej_	Dewi	have you looked at the Linux on Laptops page?
2005-12-16T10:41:00.000Z	Dewi	beej_	nope
2005-12-16T10:41:00.000Z	Dewi	beej_	but I will
2005-12-16T10:54:00.000Z	Dewi	beej_	even if I restart gdm and remove/re-add module "psmouse" it still stays on the touchpad when I want to use the cord mouse
2005-12-16T10:54:00.000Z	Dewi	beej_	so maybe it is a bios thing :/
2005-12-16T10:55:00.000Z	beej_	Dewi	check it out
