2005-06-24T16:33:00.000Z	Seveas	Addius	you could better patch the wlan-ng driver and recompile that
2005-06-24T16:35:00.000Z	Seveas	Addius	ndiswrapper on Ubuntu works painlessly :)
2005-06-24T16:38:00.000Z	Seveas	Addius	it isn't :)
2005-06-24T16:38:00.000Z	Addius	Seveas	ah, the problem is, I don't have a internet connection yet
2005-06-24T16:38:00.000Z	Seveas	Addius	ah :|
2005-06-24T16:41:00.000Z	Addius	Seveas	just a thought, would downloading linux-image-'whatever' from the archive and then use dpkg -l on it work in my case?
2005-06-24T16:41:00.000Z	Seveas	Addius	depends on wherher you grab the correct one
2005-06-24T16:42:00.000Z	Addius	Seveas	it's all up to the dice then I guess :p
2005-06-24T16:42:00.000Z	Seveas	Addius	you want linux-image-2.6.10-5-686 (for intel)
2005-06-24T16:42:00.000Z	Seveas	Addius	you want linux-image-2.6.10-5-k7 (for amd (not amd64, but ndiswrapper wont work with that anyway))
2005-06-24T16:43:00.000Z	Addius	Seveas	if I've been using the generic i386 untill now should I continue with that or go for the k7?
2005-06-24T16:44:00.000Z	Seveas	Addius	go for K7
2005-06-24T16:45:00.000Z	Seveas	Addius	no :)
2005-06-24T16:55:00.000Z	Addius	Seveas	erhm.. I installed the new linux-image, but it put everything directly into /boot/ o_O
2005-06-24T16:55:00.000Z	Seveas	Addius	it should :)
2005-06-24T16:55:00.000Z	Addius	Seveas	okay, so I do my config and rebuilding there? o_O
2005-06-24T16:56:00.000Z	Seveas	Addius	ehm, no, for that yoy need the source package
2005-06-24T16:57:00.000Z	Addius	Seveas	erhm, but I thought I already had installed the source package, ack, now I'm getting confused, isn't there just any tgz out there that I can tar out into /src/ and whatever I want with?
