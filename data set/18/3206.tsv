2009-11-26T03:08:00.000Z	gerzel		Is there anyone on who can help me with configuring a dual monitor setup?  I've got monitors working fairly well but there are some things that bug me that I'd like to fix.  Such as the fact that I can't drag windows from one monitor to the other and enabling xinerama seems to cause more problems than it solves.

2009-11-26T03:10:00.000Z	gerzel	divider	Using an Nvidia card with the propriatary drivers.
2009-11-26T03:11:00.000Z	gerzel	divider	Is that what you meant by adapter?  Otherwise I'm using basic Ubuntu, metacity gnome.
2009-11-26T03:12:00.000Z	divider	gerzel	there we go. 9800gt
2009-11-26T03:12:00.000Z	gerzel	divider	Sorry
2009-11-26T03:12:00.000Z	divider	gerzel	do you have compiz or desktop effects on?
2009-11-26T03:13:00.000Z	divider	gerzel	disable , and then try it
2009-11-26T03:14:00.000Z	gerzel	divider	turning off desktop effects doesn't change anything my cursor still stops as the edge of the first screen when I'm trying to move a window to the second
2009-11-26T03:16:00.000Z	divider	gerzel	alrighty then i'lldo some research.
2009-11-26T03:17:00.000Z	gerzel	divider	My main problem Is that I'd like to have a firefox window open on both displays and would like to be able to move a window from one display to the other.
2009-11-26T03:24:00.000Z	gerzel	divider	Should I check in with you later or give you my email?
2009-11-26T03:26:00.000Z	divider	gerzel	i'd post it into ubuntu forums. I'm doing research on both you and hipitihop's problem, its almost the same :P
2009-11-26T03:27:00.000Z	gerzel	divider	Ok I'll stick around for a bit more
2009-11-26T03:27:00.000Z	divider	gerzel	does the NCP detect your other monitor without any issues?
2009-11-26T03:28:00.000Z	gerzel	divider	I'm not sure on your terminology.  I have both monitors working, I can move my mouse off one side and get to the other, so the computer has both monitors detected and displaying properly.
2009-11-26T03:29:00.000Z	divider	gerzel	okay so whats the issue? :P
