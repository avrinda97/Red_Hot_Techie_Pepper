2007-12-07T01:49:00.000Z	danbhfive	nullset	I think that the server addition of dapper is for 5 years
2007-12-07T01:49:00.000Z	danbhfive	nullset	why do you say that?
2007-12-07T01:50:00.000Z	nullset	danbhfive	: Everytime I install ubuntu, I have to download all the softwares again and again
2007-12-07T01:51:00.000Z	danbhfive	nullset	why don't you just download a new cd?
2007-12-07T01:51:00.000Z	danbhfive	nullset	in fact, I just so happen to be doing that right now
2007-12-07T01:52:00.000Z	nullset	danbhfive	Don't you need to install mplayer and other stuff again
