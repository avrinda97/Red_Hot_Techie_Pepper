2010-07-03T08:02:00.000Z	FabParma		I would like to install samba but i am afraid that it takes too much resource. do you know more or less the real amount of resouces used when is idle?
2010-07-03T08:02:00.000Z	Roasted	FabParma	let me see if it shows up in my resources listing, 1 second
2010-07-03T08:03:00.000Z	FabParma	Roasted	thanks
2010-07-03T08:03:00.000Z	Roasted	FabParma	its not under system monitor. Know any terminal apps to find what samba may be using?
2010-07-03T08:04:00.000Z	FabParma	Roasted	 not present typing "top"?
2010-07-03T08:04:00.000Z	Roasted	FabParma	Im not seein git. I have top running now
2010-07-03T08:04:00.000Z	Roasted	FabParma	I really, really doubt samba uses much resources though
2010-07-03T08:05:00.000Z	Roasted	FabParma	I've ran samba on pretty old laptops. Its just a file sharing protocol.
2010-07-03T08:05:00.000Z	Roasted	FabParma	the only "hit" my computer takes is when somebody is writing a massive amount of data to my computer as I'm using it. Then it's just regular resource wear as the hard drives write the data that the user is p ushing to their share.
2010-07-03T08:06:00.000Z	Roasted	FabParma	but I have 3rd party apps for those guys to auto-backup at 4 am, and it only lasts a few seconds, so I never see any performance hit :)
2010-07-03T08:07:00.000Z	FabParma	Roasted	a: ps command select all processes on a terminal, including those of other users
2010-07-03T08:08:00.000Z	Roasted	FabParma	still not seeing nay output
2010-07-03T08:08:00.000Z	Roasted	FabParma	yet my samba is running. My virtual machines can see my shares, etc.
2010-07-03T08:11:00.000Z	FabParma	Roasted	ps aux | less this is the good one
2010-07-03T08:12:00.000Z	FabParma	Roasted	try this, im sure that youll'se samba
2010-07-03T08:12:00.000Z	Roasted	FabParma	theres so much there, and nothing "samba" sticks out. I'm tellin ya though, I run it on old laptops, old desktops, etc.... samba yields no difference in resource usage that I can tell
2010-07-03T08:13:00.000Z	FabParma	Roasted	thank you for your opininion
2010-07-03T08:24:00.000Z	FabParma	Roasted	 i found a tool very usefull. if you want try it "sudo apt-get install htop" it swos all process, you can scroll down to see everything an in more pressing f3 you ca searche exactly the process that you are looking for
