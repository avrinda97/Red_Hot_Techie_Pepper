2006-06-08T13:50:00.000Z	cge	jighead	have you looked at bug 36014?
2006-06-08T13:54:00.000Z	cge	jighead	386 appears to have the same problem now.
2006-06-08T13:54:00.000Z	jighead	cge	lame
2006-06-08T14:10:00.000Z	jighead	cge	look at the dpkg man pages and search for downgrade
2006-06-08T14:10:00.000Z	jighead	cge	i think it's one of the --force options
2006-06-08T14:10:00.000Z	cge	jighead	The issue is that the older version no longer appears in the repos for dapper, apparently.
2006-06-08T14:11:00.000Z	jighead	cge	go to a breezy mirror and grab a kernel
2006-06-08T14:19:00.000Z	jighead	cge	you could get the source you want from kernel.org and use make-kpkg to build your own kernel deb
2006-06-08T14:19:00.000Z	cge	jighead	I believe that ubuntu-specific changes are the problem.
2006-06-08T14:20:00.000Z	jighead	cge	which doesn't help if you want ubuntu specific stuff
2006-06-08T14:21:00.000Z	jighead	cge	how long have you been running dapper
2006-06-08T14:22:00.000Z	cge	jighead	For at least a few months, but this is a fresh install, so nothing in /var/cache/apt/archives ...
2006-06-08T14:22:00.000Z	jighead	cge	you could check in /var/cache/apt/archives to see if you have older stuff still sitting around
2006-06-08T14:22:00.000Z	jighead	cge	dern it!
2006-06-08T14:23:00.000Z	cge	jighead	I believe that the bug I am looking at (36014) was caused by a change, probably in configuration, between the two versions.
2006-06-08T14:24:00.000Z	jighead	cge	yeah, i looked at that bug, it's been open for over a month now, and is pretty clearly verified
2006-06-08T14:24:00.000Z	cge	jighead	Yes. It is rather important, too, for those who have it.
2006-06-08T14:25:00.000Z	jighead	cge	yeah, it's a show stopper on a laptop
