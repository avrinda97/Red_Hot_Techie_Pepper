2005-01-09T17:39:00.000Z	neighborlee	will	just in case you have any other ideas before I make forum post...I am unable  ( I went to URL you pasted )to run k3bsetup as root user only as regular user..so I run it and it asks for my password but then I get this:: Command 'kcmshell' 'k3bsetup2' not found ? ;_)
2005-01-09T17:41:00.000Z	will	neighborlee	you must follow the howto, and use the 'Root Terminal'
2005-01-09T17:42:00.000Z	will	neighborlee	also remember that you have to have all the correct packages, that k3b 'suggests' (ie k3blibs etc)
