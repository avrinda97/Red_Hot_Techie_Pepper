2011-03-07T01:12:00.000Z	DaGeek247	timmahkins	the 'mount' command.
2011-03-07T01:17:00.000Z	DaGeek247	timmahkins	if the drive is in, and ubuntu recognizes it, you can mount/open it from the places menu on the desktop
2011-03-07T01:18:00.000Z	DaGeek247	timmahkins	then its prolly not a) plugged in right b) recognized by ubuntu
