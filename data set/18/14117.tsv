2006-06-23T08:35:00.000Z	Flannel	vanberge	yeah, delete them.
2006-06-23T08:35:00.000Z	vanberge	Flannel	thx
2007-05-06T11:36:00.000Z	Flannel	vanberge	Read the last clause of that factoid.  k9copy is useful to copy DVDs
2007-05-06T12:30:00.000Z	Flannel	vanberge	what?  vi already is symlinked to vim
2007-05-06T12:30:00.000Z	vanberge	Flannel	no it isnt.
2007-05-06T12:30:00.000Z	vanberge	Flannel	i type vi, and vim each in command line... they are not hte same
2007-05-06T12:32:00.000Z	Flannel	vanberge	`ls -al /etc/alternateives | grep vi` returns what for /etc/alternateives/vi?
2007-05-06T12:33:00.000Z	Flannel	vanberge	er, that should be /etc/alternateives not however I spelt it
2007-05-06T12:33:00.000Z	vanberge	Flannel	 in /usr/bin - vi is  linked to /etc/alternatives/vi
2007-05-06T12:33:00.000Z	vanberge	Flannel	 vim is linked to /etc/alternatives/vim
2007-05-06T12:34:00.000Z	Flannel	vanberge	right.  that's not what I asked.  Look in /etc/alternatives for what those are linked to
2007-05-06T12:35:00.000Z	vanberge	Flannel	 vi = vim.tiny
2007-05-06T12:35:00.000Z	Flannel	vanberge	and vim?
2007-05-06T12:35:00.000Z	vanberge	Flannel	 vim.tiny as well... ?
2007-05-06T12:36:00.000Z	Flannel	vanberge	There you go ;)  Ubuntu's default vim is vim-tiny, you want to install the full one.  Don't remove vim-tiny though, just install vim
2007-05-06T12:38:00.000Z	Flannel	vanberge	Edgy is when it become standard.
