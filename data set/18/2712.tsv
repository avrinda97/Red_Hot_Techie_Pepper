2010-03-12T10:22:00.000Z	tws7		hi all
2010-03-12T10:22:00.000Z	tws7		my system is not booting up
2010-03-12T10:22:00.000Z	tws7		not mounting /home
2010-03-12T10:23:00.000Z	tws7		asks me to enter recovery shell
2010-03-12T10:23:00.000Z	tws7		any solution?
2010-03-12T10:25:00.000Z	mjec	tws7	there are several possible reasons for this. Could be configuration changes, hard drive error etc.
2010-03-12T10:26:00.000Z	tws7	mjec	i see...
2010-03-12T10:26:00.000Z	mjec	tws7	have you changed any hardware recently? Done an upgrade of software?
2010-03-12T10:26:00.000Z	tws7	mjec	no
2010-03-12T10:27:00.000Z	tws7	mjec	had mounted a portable harddrive...
2010-03-12T10:27:00.000Z	mjec	tws7	maybe, if it uses the same interface as /home. try unplugging and rebooting.
2010-03-12T10:30:00.000Z	mjec	tws7	how much do you know about partitions, filesystems etc?
2010-03-12T10:31:00.000Z	tws7	mjec	you want me to do something?
2010-03-12T10:32:00.000Z	mjec	tws7	basics will help. If you type "fdisk -l" (no quotes and that's lower case L), can you tell if its output is right?
2010-03-12T10:34:00.000Z	tws7	mjec	output is correct
2010-03-12T10:35:00.000Z	mjec	tws7	so that shows all the drives you'd expect? That's good. Now "cat /etc/fstab"... you should see /home in the second column somewhere
2010-03-12T10:36:00.000Z	mjec	tws7	track that back and see what's in the first column. is that device showing as valid in fdisk?
2010-03-12T10:37:00.000Z	tws7	mjec	what do u mean by valid?
