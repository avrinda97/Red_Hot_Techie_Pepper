2008-11-27T22:02:00.000Z	[TiZ]		Hi there. Evolution's default notifications are really, really lame... e.g, "1 new message in Inbox." I'd like it to say the sender and subject of new messages. Can I get it to do this?
2008-11-27T22:03:00.000Z	Slart	[TiZ]	well.. there is small task tray app called.. mail-notification or similar that does that.. not sure if you can make it check your evolution mailbox though
2008-11-27T22:04:00.000Z	Slart	[TiZ]	you're welcome
2008-12-04T00:23:00.000Z	Slart	[TiZ]	try the logs.. syslog, dmesg, kern.log
2008-12-04T00:24:00.000Z	[TiZ]	Slart	Where is syslog?
2008-12-04T00:24:00.000Z	Slart	[TiZ]	/var/log/syslog
2008-12-04T00:26:00.000Z	[TiZ]	Slart	Nothing concerning the crash in any of those logs.
2008-12-04T00:26:00.000Z	Slart	[TiZ]	then I guess it's back to running the app from a terminal.. I don't know of any other way
2008-12-04T00:27:00.000Z	[TiZ]	Slart	That is unacceptable. I will not run every program that I would ever want to run from a terminal. I was running XChat a couple minutes ago, and it randomly crashed, seemingly for no reason. There must be some way to notify me why a program crashes.
2008-12-04T00:28:00.000Z	Slart	[TiZ]	oh.. I'm so sorry.. I will immediately go fix it.. our custo... wait a minute.. I didn't create the system.. yea.. that's right.. I'm just a user.. go away
2008-12-04T00:29:00.000Z	[TiZ]	Slart	I'm not complaining at you, I'm letting off steam. Cool it.
2008-12-04T00:29:00.000Z	[TiZ]	Slart	Though I do apologize, I guess it did seem that way.
2008-12-04T00:30:00.000Z	Slart	[TiZ]	apology accepted.. I still don't know of any other way though.. if there is a segmentation fault or something like that it usually ends up in the syslog..
2008-12-04T00:31:00.000Z	[TiZ]	Slart	Looks like I turned off my loggers. :x I'll turn them back on, and check next time an app crashes. Still, it'd be nice if a notification popped up or something. Maybe I'll stop by brainstorm.
2008-12-04T00:31:00.000Z	Slart	[TiZ]	ah.. that would explain it.. =)
2009-01-04T03:11:00.000Z	Slart	[TiZ]	I wouldn't start worrying until it's been an hour or so
2009-01-04T03:18:00.000Z	Slart	[TiZ]	it depends on what you want to torture it with.. but running abiword, gnumeric and xfce might just work nicely
2009-01-04T03:18:00.000Z	Slart	[TiZ]	I run xubuntu on my mini-itx board.. those are kind of slow (but still modern so it might not be comparable)
