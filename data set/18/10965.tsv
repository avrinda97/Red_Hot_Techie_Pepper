2006-09-30T12:57:00.000Z	dummyuno		guys, how to get my freenode nick dropped if I forgot my password?
2006-09-30T12:58:00.000Z	kitche	dummyuno	it's 90 days you have to wait
2006-09-30T13:07:00.000Z	kitche	dummyuno	those are kernel config options
2006-09-30T13:07:00.000Z	dummyuno	kitche	how do I do to apply them
2006-09-30T13:08:00.000Z	kitche	dummyuno	you need the kernel source
2006-09-30T13:08:00.000Z	dummyuno	kitche	is there a howto about that?
2006-09-30T13:09:00.000Z	kitche	dummyuno	yes there is many howto's on how to do that
2006-09-30T13:10:00.000Z	dummyuno	kitche	I already have a previous kernel showing up in GRUB so I can take my chances
2006-09-30T13:11:00.000Z	kitche	dummyuno	well if you save the kernel you make as the same name of the kernel already there it will overwrite that kernel that you have already made
2006-09-30T13:12:00.000Z	dummyuno	kitche	I mean from the update service
2006-09-30T13:13:00.000Z	kitche	dummyuno	yes but if you name the kernel that you compile as the same name of the kernel you havr now that kernel you have now will be gone
2006-09-30T13:14:00.000Z	kitche	dummyuno	but here is the wiki entry https://wiki.ubuntu.com/KernelCustomBuild?highlight=%28kernel%29
2006-09-30T13:15:00.000Z	dummyuno	kitche	I would be carful with that
2006-09-30T13:15:00.000Z	dummyuno	kitche	Is there a way to check the config of my current kernel?
2006-09-30T13:17:00.000Z	kitche	dummyuno	well if you get the kernel source it will probably have the same config, but you can check /boot for a .config file
2006-09-30T13:23:00.000Z	dummyuno	kitche	thanks on the pointers, let me get to work on it
2006-09-30T13:31:00.000Z	dummyuno	kitche	would it be a safer route to file a bug in Launchpad?
2006-09-30T13:32:00.000Z	kitche	dummyuno	yeah probably easier
