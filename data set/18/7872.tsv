2007-11-02T03:00:00.000Z	OldPink		Help! Used dd to transfer everything from my 5.5GB partition on old HD to new 18GB partition on new HD but now when on the new HD some applications still read 5.5GB, nothing has recognized the growth, apart from fdisk, etc?
2007-11-02T03:01:00.000Z	kinaole	OldPink	- df
2007-11-02T03:02:00.000Z	OldPink	kinaole	What? df?
2007-11-02T03:02:00.000Z	kinaole	OldPink	... df <enter> shows free / used space on all mounted devices
2007-11-02T03:03:00.000Z	OldPink	kinaole	/dev/hda1              5281316   3642592   1370444  73% /
2007-11-02T03:03:00.000Z	kinaole	OldPink	- use df -h  ... if you want units in Mb rather than blocks
2007-11-02T03:04:00.000Z	OldPink	kinaole	/dev/hda1             5.1G  3.5G  1.4G  73% /
2007-11-02T03:04:00.000Z	OldPink	kinaole	Gparted says 73% used, but has the sizes right. Meaning it's just filled 73% with supposedly nothing.
2007-11-02T03:04:00.000Z	kinaole	OldPink	- where is the new 18gb drive? hdb1?
2007-11-02T03:06:00.000Z	OldPink	kinaole	nope, hda1
2007-11-02T03:06:00.000Z	OldPink	kinaole	hda1, the one that, for some stupid reason, still reads 5.5GB
2007-11-02T03:06:00.000Z	kinaole	OldPink	- hda1 does not have 18gb - only 5.5
2007-11-02T03:06:00.000Z	kinaole	OldPink	- what does fdisk show?
2007-11-02T03:08:00.000Z	OldPink	kinaole	Disk /dev/hda1: 19.4 GB, 19469205504 bytes
2007-11-02T03:10:00.000Z	kinaole	OldPink	- that does not match what df shows
2007-11-02T03:10:00.000Z	OldPink	kinaole	THAT'S THE PROBLEM!
2007-11-02T03:10:00.000Z	OldPink	kinaole	Something, somewhere makes it think it's on the old HD. ONLY THE NEW 20GB HD IS IN.
2007-11-02T03:11:00.000Z	kinaole	OldPink	- can you jumber and cable to run both at once?
