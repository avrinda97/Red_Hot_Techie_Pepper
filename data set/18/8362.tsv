2007-10-15T11:57:00.000Z	riotkittie	Ryuho	what kind of system specs do you have going on? has ubuntu always been slow?
2007-10-15T11:58:00.000Z	Ryuho	riotkittie	: i have motion tablet, 1.1GH CPU Intel Pentium M, 1GB RAM
2007-10-15T12:22:00.000Z	riotkittie	Ryuho	no, not unless your hardware is really, really bad. :P
2007-10-15T12:24:00.000Z	riotkittie	Ryuho	old computer being your tablet?
2007-10-15T12:24:00.000Z	Ryuho	riotkittie	yes
2007-10-15T12:26:00.000Z	riotkittie	Ryuho	ubuntu should be fine. i'm running it on a laptop with far lesser stats. maybe it's something with your config. but you may want to try xubuntu [which uses the lighterweight xfce desktop environment]  or install something like fluxbox
2007-10-15T12:27:00.000Z	Ryuho	riotkittie	i keep on hearing my tablet is good enough, but .... i look over and it's still frozen
2007-10-15T12:28:00.000Z	riotkittie	Ryuho	a clean install? and its still sluggish!?  try installing the xubuntu-desktop package [or just xfce4 - you can find either in the repos]  and see if that improves things. if it does, and you want to do away with GNOME, you can just remove it without having to do a reinstall
2007-10-15T12:34:00.000Z	riotkittie	Ryuho	it /could/ be. linux can be really wonky when it comes to fans - if yours isnt turning on or turning on often enough.. then yea, you can have performance issues like the lag and freezes.
2007-10-15T12:35:00.000Z	Ryuho	riotkittie	i thought most fans were usually hardware controlled
2007-10-15T12:59:00.000Z	riotkittie	Ryuho	xfce is in the repos. you can download it via apt, or synaptic. if you have space, you may want to go for xubuntu-desktop  instead
2007-10-15T13:07:00.000Z	riotkittie	Ryuho	indeed it is.  although it has made me terribly lazy. :|
2007-10-21T12:10:00.000Z	riotkittie	Ryuho	you could use gparted on a ubuntu live CD if you have one on hand, or download the actual gparted live cd
2007-10-21T12:10:00.000Z	Ryuho	riotkittie	cool i have liveCD
2007-10-21T12:11:00.000Z	riotkittie	Ryuho	i'm not sure if gparted's on the LiveCDs prior to gutsy, if not you can apt-get install it while using the live disc
2007-10-21T12:14:00.000Z	riotkittie	Ryuho	if the bug report isnt marked as close, it's a safe guess no
2007-10-21T12:15:00.000Z	riotkittie	Ryuho	no clue. it's crazy. :|
