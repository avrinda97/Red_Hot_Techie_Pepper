2009-02-09T01:38:00.000Z	robf		when I go to restricted drivers,  it says "none found"  normally it'd not say this (I ran the ati restricted drivers and it broke x,  so I removed fglrx* and ati/radeon xserver-xorg-video drivers
2009-02-09T01:38:00.000Z	robf		but in the future I want restricted drivers to function correctly if this is ever fixed...why are they not appearing in there now?
2009-02-09T01:38:00.000Z	deany	robf	i recommend the lastest ATI/AMD driver....
2009-02-09T01:39:00.000Z	robf		well I mean,  than asking quesitons
2009-02-09T01:39:00.000Z	robf	deany	oh no no,  I've no problem there ;)
2009-02-09T01:39:00.000Z	deany		latest**
2009-02-09T01:39:00.000Z	robf	deany	the issue is that it simply isn't showing anything IN the restricted drivers app now
2009-02-09T01:39:00.000Z	deany		still, i`d use that myself... I do.
2009-02-09T01:39:00.000Z	robf	deany	I wondered why it wouldn o longer show the ati drivers (even though I'm not going to use them)
2009-02-09T01:39:00.000Z	deany		ok
2009-02-09T01:40:00.000Z	deany		maybe need to do an update or upgrade?
2009-02-09T01:40:00.000Z	deany		wifi driver for my laptop doesnt appear unitl i do an upgrade.... which is a minus point for ubuntu
2009-02-09T01:41:00.000Z	robf	deany	thing is I upgraded to 8.10 from 8.04,  ati restricted drivers broke X,  so I purged fglrx* / xserver-xorg-video-ati and xserver-xorg-video-radeon   did removing these packages cause the items to disapear from the restricted driver applet
2009-02-09T01:41:00.000Z	robf		need I simply remerge them?
2009-02-09T01:41:00.000Z	robf		er re apt-get them?
2009-02-09T01:41:00.000Z	deany		I try and stay away from upgrading...
2009-02-09T01:41:00.000Z	robf	deany	understandable,  but at this point I'm where I am ;)
2009-02-09T01:42:00.000Z	deany	robf	sometimes, fixin it is more trouble than reinstalling :)
