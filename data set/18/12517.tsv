2009-10-16T07:52:00.000Z	jeeves_Moss		what causes a system not accept a preshared key?  I have 2 servers and a laptop.  I can get a passwordless login from my laptop to server #1 and I can log into the laptop from server #1 to the laptop.  As well, I can connect with server 2 to the laptop and server #1, but not the other way around
2009-10-16T07:52:00.000Z	Laibsch	jeeves_Moss	you lost me
2009-10-16T07:53:00.000Z	jeeves_Moss	Laibsch	think of it as a triangle.  I can get the laptop to connect (without a password) to only one server.
2009-10-16T07:53:00.000Z	jeeves_Moss	Laibsch	yes.  I want all 3 systems to connect without a password.
2009-10-16T07:54:00.000Z	jeeves_Moss	Laibsch	currently, I have server #2 connecting to the other 2 systems with no problem, but we can't connect to server #2 without a password
2009-10-16T07:55:00.000Z	Laibsch	jeeves_Moss	I'm assuming you're talking about ssh connections
2009-10-16T07:57:00.000Z	Laibsch	jeeves_Moss	Make sure the key you want to connect with is listed in ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2 on server2
2009-10-16T07:57:00.000Z	jeeves_Moss	Laibsch	and I used the same proceedure on each system.
2009-10-16T07:58:00.000Z	Laibsch	jeeves_Moss	I don't know which procedure you used
2009-10-16T07:58:00.000Z	jeeves_Moss	Laibsch	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=15082
2009-10-16T08:00:00.000Z	jeeves_Moss	Laibsch	the SSH issue is as far as I've got.  I've got the backup working between server #1 and the laptop, and as I said, I can make an outbound connection from server #2 to the laptop and server#1, but no inbound connections unless I use the password
2009-10-16T08:03:00.000Z	Laibsch	jeeves_Moss	Can you paste the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2 file for the three different computers somewhere?
2009-10-16T08:03:00.000Z	jeeves_Moss	Laibsch	I'm going to try this one first
2009-10-16T08:07:00.000Z	jeeves_Moss	Laibsch	well, I redid it, and it STILL won't let me log in!!!
2009-10-16T08:08:00.000Z	Laibsch	jeeves_Moss	I didn't say it would
2009-10-16T08:09:00.000Z	Laibsch	jeeves_Moss	You need to make sure the key is listed (saying that for the fourth or fifth time now)
2009-10-16T08:09:00.000Z	jeeves_Moss	Laibsch	and I deleted the known_hosts file and redid the share
2009-10-16T08:11:00.000Z	Laibsch	jeeves_Moss	known_hosts has nothing to do with it ( and I never mentioned the file)
