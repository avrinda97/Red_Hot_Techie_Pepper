2009-08-05T16:45:00.000Z	bjb1959		doing fresh install of jaunty and after installing nvidia driver from the hardware driver manager X won't start until I revert to old config. I know nvidia drivers suck but it used to work flawlessly in previous versions what is the problem?
2009-08-05T16:47:00.000Z	Slart	bjb1959	nvidia drivers are among the better ones.. how do you mean "won't start".. how do you "revert to old config" ?
2009-08-05T16:48:00.000Z	bjb1959	Slart	I get the X reconfigure screen asking if I want to revert or start x in low graphics mode
2009-08-05T16:48:00.000Z	Slart	bjb1959	can you pastebin the file /var/log/Xorg.0.log ?
2009-08-05T16:49:00.000Z	bjb1959	Slart	sure give me a couple minutes

2009-08-05T16:51:00.000Z	Slart	bjb1959	ok, I'll have a look
2009-08-05T16:56:00.000Z	Slart	bjb1959	what does you xorg.conf look like?
2009-08-05T16:56:00.000Z	bjb1959	Slart	give me a minute
2009-08-05T16:58:00.000Z	bjb1959	Slart	http://pastebin.ca/1519096
2009-08-05T16:59:00.000Z	Slart	bjb1959	you want to use the open source nvidia driver? or the binary driver?
2009-08-05T16:59:00.000Z	Slart	bjb1959	then remove the "driver nv" line in xorg.conf
2009-08-05T17:00:00.000Z	bjb1959	Slart	I changed that manually so X would start it used to say "nvidia" which didn't work
2009-08-05T17:01:00.000Z	Slart	bjb1959	hmm... if I were you I would uninstall everything nvidia using synaptic.. including nvidia glx and so on..reboot and try reinstalling the binary driver
2009-08-05T17:02:00.000Z	bjb1959	Slart	already did a apt-get --purge remove nvidia* and started over. didn't work
2009-08-05T17:04:00.000Z	Slart	bjb1959	odd.. does the live cd work for you?
2009-08-05T17:05:00.000Z	bjb1959	Slart	yes but I think I found some instructions that might work. don't know why jaunty doesn't work. hopefully they get it fixed for Karmic. I'll give these instructions a shot. Thanks
2009-08-05T20:46:00.000Z	bjb1959	Slart	I thought I would share my solution. I finally found it.  I have a hauppauge tv card that uses the cx18 driver that conflicts with the nvidia binary so I had to add vmalloc=256 to my kernel line in the menu.lst and everything worked great. thought I'd share in case others have the same issue
