2011-10-03T22:34:00.000Z	BenB		I don't want to argue. I just want my PC to work.
2011-10-03T22:36:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	BenB	a fresh install usually is more efficient than repairing errors
2011-10-03T22:37:00.000Z	BenB	MonkeyDust	don't suggest a reinstall, if you're not sure that it fixes the problem.
2011-10-03T22:38:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	BenB	everything else seems to fail
2011-10-03T22:39:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	BenB	if you backup first, a reinstall is no great issue
2011-10-03T22:41:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	BenB	what hardware is that?
2011-10-03T22:41:00.000Z	BenB	MonkeyDust	read up
2011-10-03T22:42:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	BenB	repeating it  is faster and easier
2011-10-03T22:42:00.000Z	BenB	MonkeyDust	no, I am trying to tell you that you shouldn't give wrong advice to people.
2011-10-03T22:43:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	BenB	wrong advice?
2011-10-03T22:43:00.000Z	BenB	MonkeyDust	yes. suggesting a re-install (which costs about 1h), although it will not fix the problem. if you had  listened above, you would know that a reinstall cannot help.
2011-10-03T22:44:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	BenB	just came in, I wasn't at my desk
2011-10-03T22:44:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	BenB	so just repeat the initian question by pressing the up-key
2011-10-03T22:45:00.000Z	BenB	MonkeyDust	just scroll up, or if you're too lazy for that, don't say anything.
2011-10-03T22:45:00.000Z	BenB	MonkeyDust	I dom
2011-10-03T22:45:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	BenB	please stay polite, we're all volunteers trying to help
2011-10-03T22:47:00.000Z	MonkeyDust	BenB	Canonical is not brain-dead because you want to do something that is impossible
2011-10-03T22:47:00.000Z	BenB	MonkeyDust	it is possible. I just want linux 3.1 compiled and tested for 10.04.
