2011-03-12T11:29:00.000Z	casey		hey guys. i need some serious help. I am getting VERY frustrated. First and foremost, every time I try to access my home folder via the panel on top, it says error. This happens with documents, computer etc. Please help me find out why this happening.
2011-03-12T11:30:00.000Z	ohzie	casey	Well, what kind of error?
2011-03-12T11:34:00.000Z	ohzie	casey	I had this problem before on an older install
2011-03-12T11:34:00.000Z	casey	ohzie	how did you fix it?
2011-03-12T11:34:00.000Z	ohzie	casey	=\ I reinstalled ubuntu.
2011-03-12T11:34:00.000Z	ohzie	casey	I back up all my stuff so often that I don't even mess with stuff like that
2011-03-12T11:35:00.000Z	ohzie	casey	Oh surely it isn't. I just didn't bother trying to find the way to do it, because I was lazy and needed my computer to work and didn't want to spend time fixing it.
2011-03-12T11:36:00.000Z	ohzie	casey	How long have you been using linux?
2011-03-12T11:36:00.000Z	casey	ohzie	by any chance, do you know how to use wine to run photoshop 7?
2011-03-12T11:37:00.000Z	casey	ohzie	about 3 weeks. I'm a big noobie.
2011-03-12T11:37:00.000Z	ohzie	casey	http://appdb.winehq.org/appview.php?iVersionId=1336 It seems to run fine out of the box.
2011-03-12T11:38:00.000Z	casey	ohzie	isn't that just a trial though?
2011-03-12T11:38:00.000Z	ohzie	casey	you should be able to put in the product key
2011-03-12T11:39:00.000Z	casey	ohzie	awesome. Thanks for the help. Any ideas on where to point me with the other issue we were taking about?
2011-03-12T11:41:00.000Z	ohzie	casey	None at all. What I CAN say is that I've had less problems with Ubuntu than I've had with FC and Mandrake, and that Ubuntu is "where it's at" as they say.
2011-03-12T11:41:00.000Z	ohzie	casey	So stick to this distro! Don't be swayed! :P
2011-03-12T11:42:00.000Z	casey	ohzie	well i'm glad I at least went with the right linux distro lol ;P. Not just to get "hip" with this linux stuff as they say.
2011-03-12T11:43:00.000Z	casey	ohzie	Got to go but thanks for the help :D!
