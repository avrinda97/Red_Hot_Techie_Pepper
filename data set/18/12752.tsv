2006-03-15T16:06:00.000Z	chrisw69		the code is fine
2006-03-15T16:07:00.000Z	chrisw69		sure
2006-03-15T16:07:00.000Z	chrisw69		I installed anjuta as an IDE
2006-03-15T16:07:00.000Z	chrisw69		I've been trying to compile it in there
2006-03-15T16:07:00.000Z	chrisw69		hmm
2006-03-15T16:07:00.000Z	chrisw69		Don't you need to make an object file first?
2006-03-15T16:07:00.000Z	chrisw69		then link it?
2006-03-15T16:08:00.000Z	chrisw69		I've only worked with windows :S
2006-03-15T16:08:00.000Z	chrisw69		that's good
2006-03-15T16:08:00.000Z	chrisw69		well
2006-03-15T16:08:00.000Z	gnomefreak	chrisw69	compile it as he said g++ foo.cpp -o foo
2006-03-15T16:11:00.000Z	gnomefreak	chrisw69	C use gcc instead of g++ the rest is same
2006-03-15T16:12:00.000Z	chrisw69	gnomefreak	lol i meant the files
2006-03-15T16:20:00.000Z	gnomefreak	chrisw69	anjuta and kdevelop are the 2 easiest IDE's to use imo
2006-03-15T16:52:00.000Z	gnomefreak	chrisw69	in breezy?
2006-03-15T16:52:00.000Z	gnomefreak	chrisw69	you might find a .deb on their site if not you would need to compile it
2006-03-15T16:53:00.000Z	gnomefreak	chrisw69	download the .deb than run sudo dpkg -i file.deb to install it
2006-03-15T16:55:00.000Z	gnomefreak	chrisw69	that i cant answer i have never used amsn but i dont see why you would need it
