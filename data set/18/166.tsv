2012-07-12T13:30:00.000Z	rectec		Hello guys. I'm getting these odd artifacts on the screen using the open source ATI drivers with my Radeon 6670. This is a fresh install of Ubuntu. I used these drivers before with my old 4200 and had no problems, but once I upgraded to a 6670 I started getting these. I tried using the proprietary drivers but that broke my system, which is why I have a fresh install now. Any help? http://imgbin.org/images/8742.png
2012-07-12T13:31:00.000Z	namelezz	rectec	just try to install fglrx (but not the package with updates)
2012-07-12T13:32:00.000Z	rectec	namelezz	not the post-updates one? I hope you can understand I'm a bit wary of doing so.
2012-07-12T13:51:00.000Z	namelezz	rectec	yes, amd sucks
2012-07-12T13:51:00.000Z	namelezz	rectec	your last chance is to use the newest version of fglrx
2012-07-12T13:52:00.000Z	namelezz	rectec	download 12.6 here http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/linux/Pages/radeon_linux.aspx
2012-07-12T13:54:00.000Z	rectec	namelezz	ok. Typing from my phone so you'll have to excuse my slow responses
2012-07-12T13:55:00.000Z	rectec	namelezz	so, just in install fglrx to get back to the desktop?
2012-07-12T13:56:00.000Z	namelezz	rectec	not sure, but it could work
2012-07-12T13:57:00.000Z	namelezz	rectec	you will use the open source drivers then
2012-07-12T13:58:00.000Z	namelezz	rectec	when you got to the desktop, download and installed fglrx 12.6 as described above
2012-07-12T14:09:00.000Z	rectec	namelezz	Installing said drivers. Getting a bunch of dependency issues, must manually install some packages. I will let you know if it goes smoothly.
2012-07-12T14:17:00.000Z	rectec	namelezz	ok. It produced 3 packages. Which to install? Dumb question, I know. Just need confirmation.
2012-07-12T14:18:00.000Z	namelezz	rectec	fglrx-modaliases, fglrx and fglrx-amdcccle
2012-07-12T14:19:00.000Z	rectec	namelezz	it appears I have fglrx-dev instead of fglrx-modaliasas.
2012-07-12T14:20:00.000Z	namelezz	rectec	then install just fglrx and amdcccle
2012-07-12T14:28:00.000Z	rectec	namelezz	Well, the packages install successfully. Unfortunately, I still get the same out of frequency error. Here's an idea: I'm getting my DVI cable tomorrow, which will enable me to hook up my LCD monitor to the PC. Could this perhaps alleviate this out of range error?
2012-07-12T14:29:00.000Z	namelezz	rectec	i dont know, try it
