2009-02-27T07:56:00.000Z	alex6164		im still wondering about my java problem.
2009-02-27T07:57:00.000Z	rww	alex6164	Are you looking for the Java web browser plugin, or a Java programming environment, or...
2009-02-27T07:58:00.000Z	rww	alex6164	are you using 32-bit or 64-bit Ubuntu?
2009-02-27T07:59:00.000Z	rww	alex6164	Have you tried installing sun-java6-plugin ?
2009-02-27T07:59:00.000Z	rww	alex6164	Okay. Which web browser are you trying to use it with?
2009-02-27T08:00:00.000Z	rww	alex6164	with sun-java6-plugin installed, type "about:plugins" in your address bar, and see if it lists any java-related stuff
2009-02-27T08:02:00.000Z	rww	alex6164	okay. Do you see a pink square on http://www.javatester.org/version.html with java information in it?
2009-02-27T08:06:00.000Z	rww	alex6164	I'm not sure. Try running firefox in a terminal and see if you get any error output when you go to the test page.
2009-02-27T08:07:00.000Z	rww	alex6164	open a Terminal, type "firefox" into it, open the tester page in firefox, look in the Terminal and see if messages appeared in it.
2009-02-27T08:08:00.000Z	rww	alex6164	are you sure the java applet loaded? grey boxes sometimes mean it's still loading.
2009-02-27T08:09:00.000Z	rww	alex6164	okay, looks like you have the Java plugin working, then.
2009-02-27T08:09:00.000Z	rww	alex6164	it just did load that test page
2009-02-27T08:10:00.000Z	rww	alex6164	no problem
