2010-12-29T10:46:00.000Z	lwizardl		In 10.10 how do I tell it to use the windows key as the shortcut for opening the menu ? when i go into shortcuts select the option and press the windows key nothing happens on my other computers they switch to super_L but on this laptop its not registering the command
2010-12-29T10:47:00.000Z	icarus-c	lwizardl	for Windows key, you have to edit the keyboard shortcut config directly
2010-12-29T10:47:00.000Z	icarus-c	lwizardl	like with gconf-editor or gconftool
2010-12-29T10:49:00.000Z	icarus-c	lwizardl	eh wait. for "menu" you mean the main menu in the panel? which default to Alt-F1 ?
2010-12-29T10:49:00.000Z	lwizardl	icarus-c	yes
2010-12-29T10:51:00.000Z	icarus-c	lwizardl	issue this command :  gconftool-2 --set /apps/metacity/global_keybindings/panel_main_menu --type string "Super_L"
2010-12-29T10:52:00.000Z	lwizardl	icarus-c	command not found
2010-12-29T10:52:00.000Z	icarus-c	lwizardl	are you using GNOME?
2010-12-29T10:52:00.000Z	lwizardl	icarus-c	yes
2010-12-29T10:53:00.000Z	icarus-c	lwizardl	do you have gconf-editor ?
2010-12-29T10:53:00.000Z	lwizardl	icarus-c	yes
2010-12-29T10:54:00.000Z	icarus-c	lwizardl	well you could use gconf-editor, navigate to /apps/metacity/global_keybindings/panel_main_menu   and change its value to Super_L
2010-12-29T10:55:00.000Z	lwizardl	icarus-c	that worked thanks
