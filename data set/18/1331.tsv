2011-07-27T21:20:00.000Z	g[r]eek		Hi. I have a monitor plugged into my laptop. Is it possible to make the laptop screen separate from the monitor screen, so that when I move my mouse to its edge, it doesn't automatically shift over to the other screen?
2011-07-27T21:21:00.000Z	g[r]eek		Basically I want to be able to see my laptop screen's contents, but I never need to move my mouse to it (and on the rare occasion that I do, I can just press some kind of shortcut to make it the active / focused screen. Is that possible?
2011-07-27T21:23:00.000Z	g[r]eek		The best would be to be able to dedicate a workspace to it.
2011-07-27T21:23:00.000Z	g[r]eek		Is it possible to dedicate a workspace to a 2nd screen?
2011-07-27T21:24:00.000Z	g[r]eek		Cause with the default settings, when both screens are on / active, the taskbar only appears on the one.
2011-07-27T21:24:00.000Z	altice	g[r]eek	do you mean have a separate logon X session?
2011-07-27T21:24:00.000Z	g[r]eek	altice	I'm not sure what that means :(
2011-07-27T21:25:00.000Z	g[r]eek	altice	ok cool how do I go about that?
2011-07-27T21:26:00.000Z	g[r]eek	altice	my laptop has ATI graphics card
2011-07-27T21:27:00.000Z	g[r]eek	altice	where are these "screen settings" you speak of? In my System menu there is only "Monitor settings" which doesn't seem to have any options for adjusting logon session etc
2011-07-27T21:28:00.000Z	altice	g[r]eek	you can either have a "twin view" which extends the current desktop OR a separate "X Screen"
2011-07-27T21:32:00.000Z	altice	g[r]eek	having trouble finding screen shots on the GUI, I'd suggest just playing around/look for the setting I'm talking about, it exists
2011-07-27T21:32:00.000Z	g[r]eek	altice	ok thanks will do
2011-07-27T21:32:00.000Z	g[r]eek	altice	I'm going to leave this channel now because it's a bit noisy. I'll pop back in if I come right
2011-07-27T21:47:00.000Z	g[r]eek	altice	just out of curiosity, assuming I got the separate X login session on my other screen to work, how would I switch my keyboard / mouse between the two screens?
2011-07-27T21:47:00.000Z	altice	g[r]eek	download a program called "quicksynergy" and setup the client/server relationship between them. Then you can use both the mouse and keyboard seemlessly
2011-07-27T21:48:00.000Z	g[r]eek	altice	ok thanks
2011-07-27T21:55:00.000Z	g[r]eek	altice	do you mind if I pm you
