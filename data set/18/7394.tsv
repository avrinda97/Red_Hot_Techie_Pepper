2010-01-19T16:43:00.000Z	_nmap	hipitihop	yes
2010-01-19T16:43:00.000Z	hipitihop	_nmap	so what do you get from "lsusb"
2010-01-19T16:45:00.000Z	_nmap	hipitihop	humm the hardware is listed on lsusb response..
2010-01-19T16:48:00.000Z	hipitihop	_nmap	ok, what line lsits your device ?
2010-01-19T16:50:00.000Z	hipitihop	_nmap	still there ?
2010-01-19T16:50:00.000Z	_nmap	hipitihop	Bus 003 Device 002: ID 00ff:5731 Authentec, Inc. AES3500 Trueprint Sensor
2010-01-19T16:51:00.000Z	_nmap	hipitihop	i think is that line
2010-01-19T16:52:00.000Z	hipitihop	_nmap	the important information is 00ff:5731 you may want to google that along with ubuntu... the lsusb atleast tells you that your system can see the device plugged in
2010-01-19T16:56:00.000Z	hipitihop	_nmap	do you know what model it is ?
2010-01-19T16:58:00.000Z	_nmap	hipitihop	is this one here: http://www.apc.com/resource/include/techspec_index.cfm?base_sku=biopod-ec&tab=features
2010-01-19T16:59:00.000Z	hipitihop	_nmap	any other devices listed by lsusb that might be the one ?
2010-01-19T17:01:00.000Z	_nmap	hipitihop	The is a Elan Microeletronics Corp. I dont know what is this... Any other devices listed i know what is... sry for my bad english
2010-01-19T17:18:00.000Z	hipitihop	_nmap	don't worry about your English. Nut you will need to understand the real manufacturer of your device and then you should be able to find if there is a driver available for it
2010-01-19T17:21:00.000Z	hipitihop	_nmap	this might also help: do "sudo mount -t usbfs none /proc/bus/usb" and then "sudo cat /proc/bus/usb/devices" you should be able to find the same device id's but also now see what driver is laoded if any.
2010-01-19T17:22:00.000Z	hipitihop	_nmap	that is all I can help with at the moment. Once you know what the real manufacturer is then you will be able to see what driver you need and if it is loaded.
2010-01-19T17:23:00.000Z	hipitihop	_nmap	good luck.
