2004-09-30T08:04:00.000Z	psyklops		when I try to mount my windows partition with "sudo mount -t ntfs /dev/hda1 /windows" I get "mount: wrong fs type, bad option...". What am I doing wrong?
2004-09-30T08:05:00.000Z	mteira	psyklops	Are you sure it's a ntfs partition and it's on hda1?
2004-09-30T08:06:00.000Z	psyklops	mteira	lemme think for a second (I've done a few dumb things like that lately...)
2004-09-30T08:11:00.000Z	mteira	psyklops	directories as files?
2004-09-30T08:11:00.000Z	mteira	psyklops	directories as files?
2004-09-30T08:13:00.000Z	mteira	psyklops	So, try mounting it using -o uid=(your uid)
2004-09-30T08:16:00.000Z	mteira	psyklops	It is
2004-09-30T08:17:00.000Z	mteira	psyklops	Just, as your user, type id
2004-09-30T08:17:00.000Z	mteira	psyklops	Probably you uid will be 1000
2004-09-30T08:21:00.000Z	mteira	psyklops	What are you trying to do?
2004-09-30T08:22:00.000Z	mteira	psyklops	So, you need an entry in your fstab.
2004-09-30T08:23:00.000Z	mteira	psyklops	Something like:
2004-09-30T08:23:00.000Z	mteira	psyklops	If you want to be able to mount it as a normal user, then:
2004-09-30T08:24:00.000Z	mteira	psyklops	If you don't want it to be mounted at boot time:
2004-09-30T08:24:00.000Z	mteira	psyklops	user is to be able to mount as an user.
2004-09-30T08:24:00.000Z	mteira	psyklops	uid=1000 is to fix the permissions.
2004-09-30T08:25:00.000Z	mteira	psyklops	To map the mount as owned by your user.
2004-09-30T08:25:00.000Z	mteira	psyklops	Perhaps user is enough, I don't remember
