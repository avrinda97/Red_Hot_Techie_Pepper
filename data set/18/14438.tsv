2005-12-20T14:05:00.000Z	sobersabre		has anybody got KDE3.5 on breezy  in here ?
2005-12-20T14:07:00.000Z	sobersabre		i repeat: is anybody using KDE3.5 on breezy here ?
2005-12-20T14:07:00.000Z	trappist	sobersabre	will it help if somebody says no?
2005-12-20T14:07:00.000Z	sobersabre	trappist	i expect another answer
2005-12-20T14:08:00.000Z	trappist	sobersabre	I expect if somebody who saw you ask is running 3.5 on breezy, you'd have gotten something
2005-12-20T14:08:00.000Z	trappist	sobersabre	I for one wouldn't know how to get 3.5 on breezy
2005-12-20T14:13:00.000Z	sobersabre	trappist	do you know how to setup in the editted .c file misc vim settings ?
2005-12-20T14:13:00.000Z	trappist	sobersabre	I'm not sure what you're asking
2005-12-20T14:14:00.000Z	sobersabre	trappist	if you wish to have one .c file tabs of 4 and another of 8... can you do this ?
2005-12-20T14:14:00.000Z	trappist	sobersabre	yes, by putting vim commands in a comment in the c files
2005-12-20T14:15:00.000Z	trappist	sobersabre	like this: # vi: et sw=2 ts=2
2005-12-20T14:15:00.000Z	sobersabre	trappist	this won't work... s/et/set/
2005-12-20T14:15:00.000Z	trappist	sobersabre	it works here
2005-12-20T14:16:00.000Z	trappist	sobersabre	I mean et works here.  I dunno if I understood your question correctly.
2005-12-20T14:16:00.000Z	sobersabre	trappist	you understood correctly.
2005-12-26T16:30:00.000Z	trappist	sobersabre	sudo apt-get install build-essential
2005-12-27T17:07:00.000Z	sobersabre	trappist	thanks!
