2007-03-08T13:51:00.000Z	IkimashoZ		Hi, I've got a question.  How is it that Ubuntu gets away with having the slogan "it just works"?  So far, in my 3 days using it, I've realized that basically it just doesn't work.  I have multiple debilitating errors, and while there seems to be a number of how-to's for "solutions" to these problems, none of them actually work either.  So now I've got windows XP, which does what I need it to do, albeit slowly and brokenly.

2007-03-08T13:51:00.000Z	IkimashoZ		which doesn't work at all
2007-03-08T13:52:00.000Z	IkimashoZ		so yeah

2007-03-08T13:53:00.000Z	mneptok	IkimashoZ	where do you see "It just works?"
2007-03-08T13:54:00.000Z	mneptok	IkimashoZ	Broadcom does not release ANY code in ANY form to allow their stuff to work with anything except Windows. this is NOT a Linux problem. it's a Broadcom problem. and if you don't like it, vote with your wallet.
2007-03-08T13:56:00.000Z	mneptok	IkimashoZ	how is "we can't see how the hardware works so we have to design solutions in the dark with our hands tied" a lousy excuse?
2007-03-08T13:58:00.000Z	mneptok	IkimashoZ	the better question is "why do you feel people are obligated to help you for free?"
2007-03-08T13:59:00.000Z	mneptok	IkimashoZ	if you'd like a guaranteed response we sell commercial support contracts.
2007-03-08T15:42:00.000Z	mneptok	IkimashoZ	just because the device is displayed does not mean Linux can actually use it. are you able to connect with that card?
2007-03-08T15:43:00.000Z	mneptok	IkimashoZ	GNOME?
2007-03-08T15:43:00.000Z	mneptok	IkimashoZ	sudo aptitude install network-manager-gnome
2007-03-08T15:45:00.000Z	mneptok	IkimashoZ	what did you type exactly?
2007-03-08T15:47:00.000Z	mneptok	IkimashoZ	remove the GNOME networking panel applet. then reboot.
