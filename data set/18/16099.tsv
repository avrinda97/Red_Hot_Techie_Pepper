2004-11-15T17:48:00.000Z	epod		 and crashed
2004-11-15T17:50:00.000Z	epod		Can anyone tell me how I can format a disk for fat32 from Linux?
2004-11-15T17:51:00.000Z	mjr	epod	with mkdosfs
2004-11-15T17:52:00.000Z	epod	mjr	it said I was attempting to create too large of a filesystem
2004-11-15T17:52:00.000Z	mjr	epod	did you spesify -F 32 ?
2004-11-15T06:04:00.000Z	epod	mjr	sorry, work happened.  So I mkdosfs -F 32 /dev/sdc1 ?
2004-11-15T06:05:00.000Z	epod	mjr	awesome, it even automounts now.  Thanks :)
2004-11-15T06:06:00.000Z	mjr	epod	shure
2004-11-15T06:07:00.000Z	mjr	epod	(mkdosfs creates only up to fat16 as default, and it has a rather low size limit)
2004-11-15T06:07:00.000Z	epod	mjr	I did mkdosfs -F 32
2004-11-15T06:08:00.000Z	mjr	epod	yes, I noticed, just thought I'd explain it also ;)
2004-11-15T06:08:00.000Z	epod	mjr	lol, ok.  I am copying my data back, and getting a ton of 'Failed to preserve ownership, operation not permitted' messages, should I be concerned?
2004-11-15T06:09:00.000Z	mjr	epod	that's probably just because fat doesn't support permissions so they can't be preserved
2004-11-15T06:09:00.000Z	mjr	epod	the data will probably be fine
2004-11-15T06:09:00.000Z	epod	mjr	okay good. :) thanks.  And the drive even nicely automounts now
2004-11-24T06:10:00.000Z	epod	mjr	my 9600 has issues with tuxracer, works fine with postal2, haven't tried nwn yet
2004-11-24T06:11:00.000Z	mjr	epod	well, I'm using the free dri driver
2004-11-24T06:11:00.000Z	epod	mjr	ohh, I'm using fglrx
