2009-04-09T18:25:00.000Z	Zelicious		just making sure... grub exsists, I'm on through ubuntu right now, what I'm lacking is the option to load windows again (everyone who answered earlier)
2009-04-09T18:26:00.000Z	ziroday	Zelicious	sorry, what is not working. You want to windows to appear as an option in grub or does grub not appear?
2009-04-09T18:27:00.000Z	Zelicious	ziroday	I added windows to the menu.lst so it appears as an option but doesn't load.
2009-04-09T18:27:00.000Z	ziroday	Zelicious	ah okay, what is the error?
2009-04-09T18:28:00.000Z	Zelicious	ziroday	I don't have the exact text but it says it can't find a kernel or operating system, I can give a quick restart and come back with the messege if that helps.
2009-04-09T18:28:00.000Z	ziroday	Zelicious	nope its fine. can you pastebin me the output of sudo fdisk -l and your /boot/grub/menu.lst please
