2009-02-16T13:14:00.000Z	spirited		trying to install netbeans and trying to follow the directions but not sure what I am doing wrong; it says to = chmod +x ./<installer-file-name>, so I do chmod +x ./netbeans-6.5-ml-linux.sh and it simply returns a prompt but nothing happens.
2009-02-16T13:14:00.000Z	spirited		Anyone?
2009-02-16T13:16:00.000Z	hbekel	spirited	no output usually means success
2009-02-16T13:16:00.000Z	spirited	hbekel	hmmmm ok let me read what to do next.
2009-02-16T13:17:00.000Z	spirited	hbekel	this is the site http://www.netbeans.org/community/releases/65/install.html
2009-02-16T13:21:00.000Z	spirited		omg it says to choose the tools to install. perform the following steps at the Welcome page of the installation wizard, which of course I see none.
2009-02-16T13:21:00.000Z	spirited		that command was supposed to make the installer files executables.
2009-02-16T13:23:00.000Z	hbekel	spirited	you need to run that install script, too
2009-02-16T13:24:00.000Z	spirited	hbekel	I don't see an install script. Is that what was made, if so would it be in the same dir?
2009-02-16T13:27:00.000Z	hbekel	spirited	chmod +x sets the executable bit on a file, it doesn't execute it
2009-02-16T13:27:00.000Z	spirited	hbekel	so chmod made that same file an executable?
2009-02-16T13:28:00.000Z	spirited		hah!
2009-02-16T13:28:00.000Z	spirited		ok I never would have expected that, thanks.
2009-02-16T13:28:00.000Z	spirited	hbekel	thanks
2009-02-16T13:29:00.000Z	spirited	hbekel	Ok where should I install most of these things like netbeans? In Vista Im used to installing in program files or off of the C:
2009-02-16T13:29:00.000Z	spirited		C:\ drive.
2009-02-16T13:32:00.000Z	spirited		Guys where are you supposed to install things in Linux? For example in windows most things go in Program Files by default or C: or whatever.
2009-02-16T13:34:00.000Z	hbekel	spirited	third party software that doesn't map to the FHS usually goes into /opt. Are you sure there is no netbeans pkg in the repos you can install via apt-get?
