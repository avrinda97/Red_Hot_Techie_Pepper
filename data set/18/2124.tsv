2011-08-21T04:43:00.000Z	thomas__		Since installing Ubuntu on my notebook the video performance is very sluggish, as if it doesn't have a proper video driver
2011-08-21T04:43:00.000Z	Quantum_Ion	thomas__	I think it might be because of Unity
2011-08-21T04:44:00.000Z	Quantum_Ion	thomas__	A lot of people have been complaining about Unity
2011-08-21T04:44:00.000Z	thomas__		Thank you, that give me a starting point to start troubshooting
2011-08-21T04:45:00.000Z	thomas__		has anyone had a solution to the Unity problem?
2011-08-21T04:45:00.000Z	Quantum_Ion	thomas__	What distro of Ubuntu Linux are you running ?
2011-08-21T04:45:00.000Z	thomas__		1104
2011-08-21T04:46:00.000Z	Quantum_Ion	thomas__	I run Ubuntu Linux 10.04 LTS I have not touched 11.04 and won't upgrade until another LTS release of Ubuntu Linux
2011-08-21T04:47:00.000Z	Quantum_Ion	thomas__	But I have heard a lot of people who are running 11.04 complain about hardware slowdown running Unity â€“ A Modern Lightweight Desktop For Ubuntu [Linux]
2011-08-21T04:47:00.000Z	thomas__	Quantum_Ion	maybe I should do that as it was a problem with the release before that also
2011-08-21T04:47:00.000Z	thomas__		I was hoping that this release would fix it
2011-08-21T04:48:00.000Z	Quantum_Ion	thomas__	The LTS releases of Ubuntu Linux just seem more stable to me,however other people might think differently
2011-08-21T04:49:00.000Z	thomas__	Quantum_Ion	Sure I prefer stability over new, I just wanted to make sure I was not missing something
2011-08-21T04:50:00.000Z	Quantum_Ion	thomas__	Not really nothing really radical as far as I can see
2011-08-21T04:50:00.000Z	Quantum_Ion	thomas__	They just need time to work out all the bugs in those new releases of Ubuntu Linux
2011-08-21T04:50:00.000Z	thomas__	Quantum_Ion	Thank you for your input
2011-08-21T04:50:00.000Z	Quantum_Ion	thomas__	np, just my humble opinion
2011-08-21T04:51:00.000Z	thomas__	Quantum_Ion	you have been very helpful
