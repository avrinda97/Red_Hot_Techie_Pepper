2007-10-23T16:43:00.000Z	Metal03		Where would the default graphic settings be in for ubuntu gutsy...  I need to chance the screen resolution for ubuntu and not only for my session!!
2007-10-23T16:45:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	Metal03	doesn't System->Administration->Screens and Graphics work?
2007-10-23T16:45:00.000Z	Metal03	howlingmadhowie	nope!
2007-10-23T16:46:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	Metal03	when you say you wish to change the display settings for ubuntu, do you mean just for xwindows or for the virtual terminals as well?
2007-10-23T16:49:00.000Z	Metal03	howlingmadhowie	Well I'm not sure what exactly I need...  my logging screen (graphical) is in 640x480 but when I log on my session it goes to 1856x1392!!  And then again when I run World of Warcraft with wine and quit, it comes back to 640x480...  I hate it!!  :D
2007-10-23T16:50:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	Metal03	mm, strange. maybe wine has a problem getting out of fullscreen mode. i've never used wine myself :(
2007-10-23T16:51:00.000Z	Metal03	howlingmadhowie	It's a possibility, but since my logging screen is in the same crappy resolution I felt it was some default settings it was just switching back to!
2007-10-23T16:52:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	Metal03	another interesting thing to explore would be why the graphical login screen (gdm) doesn't have the same resolution as your desktop. there are some settings in .gnome2(?) for the maximum deskto p resolution, but i've never seen it increase the value above gdm
2007-10-23T16:53:00.000Z	Metal03	howlingmadhowie	ok, can you help me explore this...?
2007-10-23T16:54:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	Metal03	i really don't know anything about wine. but i could read your /etc/X11/xorg.conf if you like (that's the configuration file where the settings for X are stored)
2007-10-23T16:54:00.000Z	Metal03	howlingmadhowie	sure, lemme link it!
2007-10-23T16:55:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	Metal03	but i'm not promising any fixes here :(
2007-10-23T16:56:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	Metal03	gotta go afk for a minute. will be back shortly
2007-10-23T16:56:00.000Z	Metal03	howlingmadhowie	The only fact you're helping is enough!!  http://pastebin.com/m1e97da10
2007-10-23T17:08:00.000Z	howlingmadhowie	Metal03	the xorg.conf is complicated, but i can't see anything wrong with it.
2007-10-23T17:08:00.000Z	Metal03	howlingmadhowie	:(
