2006-10-01T11:55:00.000Z	syosoft		hey guys, so i did something really stupid. i was trying to mount a new volume but fstab wasnt letting me save over it, so without a 2nd thought, i rm /etc/fstab....
2006-10-01T11:55:00.000Z	syosoft		how can i recover/recreate that file??
2006-10-01T11:55:00.000Z	syosoft		i havent rebooted yet...
2006-10-01T11:55:00.000Z	Warbo	syosoft	Look around the web for one, then tweak it to suit your computer
2006-10-01T11:56:00.000Z	Warbo	syosoft	I could pastebin mine if you want
2006-10-01T12:03:00.000Z	Warbo	syosoft	Pastebin "mount"
2006-10-01T12:07:00.000Z	Warbo	syosoft	Sorry, I didn't see your original paste, I'm taking a look now :)
2006-10-01T12:11:00.000Z	Warbo	syosoft	OK, I am a little confused here. Is /dev/hda5 your swap?
2006-10-01T12:12:00.000Z	Warbo	syosoft	OK
2006-10-01T12:12:00.000Z	Warbo	syosoft	And you want hdb to mount where? (also, is that hdb1? The fdisk paste doesn't show the partitions for some reason)
2006-10-01T12:15:00.000Z	Warbo	syosoft	one second
2006-10-01T12:16:00.000Z	Warbo	syosoft	I originally put hdb1 as ext3, but that now says vfat (fat32)
2006-10-01T12:19:00.000Z	Warbo	syosoft	Ah, fat32 has no permission system, so the option "uid-yourusername, users" might be a good thing to put in fstab
2006-10-01T12:20:00.000Z	Warbo	syosoft	under the column "options"
2006-10-01T12:24:00.000Z	Warbo	syosoft	"sudo mount -a"
2006-10-01T12:24:00.000Z	Warbo	syosoft	hdb1?
2006-10-01T12:26:00.000Z	Warbo	syosoft	fdisk looks at the drives' partition tables, so it doesn't matter whether they are mounted or not
2006-10-01T12:27:00.000Z	Warbo	syosoft	After either rebooting or running "sudo mount -a" then yes
