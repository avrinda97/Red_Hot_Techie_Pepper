2005-05-23T12:31:00.000Z	calc		it can't install g++-3.4 due to file conflicts
2005-05-23T12:32:00.000Z	tritium	calc	there'a major C++ transition right now in breezy
2005-05-23T12:33:00.000Z	calc	tritium	ah ok
2005-05-23T12:33:00.000Z	calc	tritium	though i'm not sure that is what is causing this, it appears someone moved files between parts of the gcc-3.4 source package and forgot to remove them from other parts
2005-05-23T12:33:00.000Z	tritium	calc	the whole toolchain, actually

2005-05-23T12:33:00.000Z	calc	tritium	its a conflict between g++-3.4 and libstdc++-6-0-dev both of which are part of the same source
2005-05-23T12:34:00.000Z	calc	tritium	ok

2005-10-18T10:37:00.000Z	calc	tritium	they look right according to filesize from what i see elsewhere
