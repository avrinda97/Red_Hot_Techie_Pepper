2009-06-22T23:39:00.000Z	mdm	gangil	install cpufrequtils if you havent already and run cpufreq-info
2009-06-22T23:40:00.000Z	gangil		mdm:sudo apt-get install cpufrequtils???
2009-06-22T23:44:00.000Z	gangil	mdm	http://pastebin.com/d2837fdb4 this was the output , the laptop is really heating up
2009-06-22T23:45:00.000Z	mdm	gangil	I dont doubt its getting hot, its running at full power
2009-06-22T23:45:00.000Z	gangil		then what should i do? install something extra>?
2009-06-22T23:45:00.000Z	gangil		like drivers n all
2009-06-22T23:46:00.000Z	mdm	gangil	 you can lock it and run the cpu slower, or let the cpu determine it and change its speed
2009-06-22T23:47:00.000Z	gangil	mdm	: I am a newbie , so it would be kind of u to explain it in a way i can comprehend
2009-06-22T23:49:00.000Z	mdm	gangil	your cpu has the ability to change its speed and save power and generate less heat.  It is a function of the CPU chip.   That chip, left to its own, will scale its speed according to how much its being used.  Linux gives you a way to see what that CPU is doing.  It also gives you a way to tell it NOT to do it autmaticly and to manipulate it yourself.  Its pruly a function of the cpu and the utilties to talk to it
2009-06-22T23:50:00.000Z	mdm	gangil	here is better information on it http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/kernel/cpufreq/cpufreq.html
2009-06-22T23:53:00.000Z	gangil	mdm	so do u mean I need to set it to a lower speed manually??
2009-06-22T23:55:00.000Z	gangil		mdm?
2009-06-22T23:55:00.000Z	mdm	gangil	no I am saying leave it be, if you want to you CAN nail it to a certain speed, but there really is no reason to.  Your CPU will do what it is set to do, irregardless of what the software tells it to do.  That softwares job is to talk to the CPU scaling, thats all
2009-06-22T23:56:00.000Z	gangil	mdm	: but it's heating up like anything
2009-06-22T23:56:00.000Z	mdm	gangil	run top, see whats chewing up CPU, decide if you need it or simply want it.  shut down those things
2009-06-22T23:59:00.000Z	mdm	gangil	in my truck is a guage that tells me (more like lies to me) about my gas millage.  Your asking how to fix that guage.  I am telling you your engine uses that much fuel becase you have so much in the back of the truck.  You want to know how to fix the guage I am telling you unload some of those bricks.  Get it?
