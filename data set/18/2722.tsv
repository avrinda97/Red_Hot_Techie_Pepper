2010-05-21T11:46:00.000Z	hipitihop		ever synce I have switched to lucid, I have managed to get skype into a funny state where I can't evem 'sudo killall skype' .. processes keep running.. is there a bigger hammer ?
2010-05-21T11:47:00.000Z	linuxlurker	hipitihop	you have htop?
2010-05-21T11:47:00.000Z	hipitihop	linuxlurker	yep
2010-05-21T11:48:00.000Z	linuxlurker	hipitihop	there are a number of kill options in htop..
2010-05-21T11:49:00.000Z	linuxlurker	hipitihop	other than that you can ps -e to find the pid no. and then kill 9 pid
2010-05-21T11:49:00.000Z	hipitihop	linuxlurker	is thal 'kill 9 ...' or 'kill -9 ...' ?
2010-05-21T11:49:00.000Z	linuxlurker	hipitihop	kill 9 <pid number>
2010-05-21T11:50:00.000Z	linuxlurker	hipitihop	read man kill for confirmation
2010-05-21T11:50:00.000Z	linuxlurker	hipitihop	oh..it is kill -9 pid
2010-05-21T11:50:00.000Z	linuxlurker	hipitihop	hehe..the dash is necessary
2010-05-21T11:52:00.000Z	linuxlurker	hipitihop	I think the killall would send a sigterm signal...whereas you might need a less graceful sigkill signal to stamp it out
2010-05-21T11:52:00.000Z	hipitihop	linuxlurker	seems so... the kill -9 seems to have done the trick .. many thanks
2010-05-21T11:52:00.000Z	linuxlurker	hipitihop	np
2010-05-21T11:53:00.000Z	linuxlurker	hipitihop	htop has kill options as well..both sigterm and sigkill
2010-05-21T12:02:00.000Z	hipitihop	linuxlurker	I see are you saying one of those is equivalent to -9 ?
2010-05-21T12:03:00.000Z	linuxlurker	hipitihop	yeah -9 is the sigkill
2010-05-21T12:04:00.000Z	hipitihop	linuxlurker	ok .. always something to learn :-) thanks for for the tips
2010-05-21T12:04:00.000Z	linuxlurker	hipitihop	sigterm allows the app to exit gracefully...sigkill just kills it with potential for dataloss etc..
