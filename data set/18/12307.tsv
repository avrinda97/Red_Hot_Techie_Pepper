2006-05-18T16:53:00.000Z	madmike		kBit is 1024 bits
2006-05-18T16:53:00.000Z	madmike		kByte is 1024 bytes
2006-05-18T16:54:00.000Z	madmike		bytes
2006-05-18T16:54:00.000Z	madmike		1 byte = 8 bytes
2006-05-18T16:54:00.000Z	madmike		1 byte = 8 bits
2006-05-18T16:55:00.000Z	madmike		sorry
2006-05-18T16:55:00.000Z	bbrazil	madmike	it depends
2006-05-18T16:56:00.000Z	madmike	bbrazil	why do you think so?
2006-05-18T16:56:00.000Z	bbrazil	madmike	9bit bytes
2006-05-18T16:56:00.000Z	madmike	bbrazil	never heard of that
2006-05-18T16:56:00.000Z	bbrazil	madmike	the idea mostly dies
2006-05-18T16:57:00.000Z	bbrazil	madmike	*died
2006-05-18T16:57:00.000Z	madmike	bbrazil	some kind of error correction or something?
2006-05-18T16:57:00.000Z	bbrazil	madmike	no, actually 9 bits in a byte. There's a reason the RFCs use 'octet'
2006-05-18T16:57:00.000Z	bbrazil	madmike	remember there are 18bit systems out there
2006-05-18T16:58:00.000Z	madmike	bbrazil	hmm never heard of 18 bit systems, what are those?
2006-05-18T05:00:00.000Z	bbrazil	madmike	some of the PDP series
2006-05-18T05:02:00.000Z	madmike	bbrazil	interesting
