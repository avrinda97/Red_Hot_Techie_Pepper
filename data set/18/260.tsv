2012-05-17T20:50:00.000Z	happycoolness		Hey everyone, I've upgraded to the latest ubuntu version (finally) on my home desktop computer and I'm having the two following issues: 1. files and folders are shown on my desktop, since I have tons of files and folders in my home directory this looks very cluttered and I want to just hide them. 2. Flash seems to have some sort of hardware acceleration bug and sometimes swaps the blue and red channels on youtube
2012-05-17T20:51:00.000Z	BEC	happycoolness	re 1 I suggest you move them under Documents
2012-05-17T20:52:00.000Z	happycoolness	BEC	so there is no way to turn off viewing at all, eh? That kinda sucks, but I guess I cam move stuff around.
2012-05-17T20:53:00.000Z	BEC	happycoolness	ur personal files? just Ctrl+A  & Ctrl+X & paste them under Documtns
2012-05-17T20:54:00.000Z	happycoolness	BEC	its just that I have hard coded paths in scripts and stuff, but I guess I can do that
2012-05-17T20:54:00.000Z	BEC	happycoolness	so it might breaks the links?! mmh; can't help with that but i guess u will have to correct them
2012-05-17T20:55:00.000Z	happycoolness	BEC	yeah, no worries, I'll just write a script and pattern match :)
2012-05-17T20:55:00.000Z	BEC	happycoolness	good luck
2012-05-17T21:00:00.000Z	happycoolness	BEC	I solved it! I remembered about .hidden files hiding stuff from you in the GUI file browser, so I added every filename into the .hidden file and then clicked on the desktop and ^r'ed and they all vanished :D
2012-05-17T21:01:00.000Z	BEC	happycoolness	great :D I've never heard of this; can u provide a link about it?
2012-05-17T21:04:00.000Z	happycoolness	BEC	this is the best I could find http://linux.about.com/library/gnome/blgnome6n6r.htm
2012-05-17T21:05:00.000Z	BEC	happycoolness	ah I already knew this lol; thanks anyways
2012-05-17T21:05:00.000Z	BEC	happycoolness	I usually don;t use it since I have hidden files always shown
2012-05-17T21:06:00.000Z	happycoolness	BEC	Ahhh, see, I almost always use the keyboard in Terminal since using the mouse hurts my arm, so I really have very little use for GUI based stuff in the first place
2012-05-17T21:06:00.000Z	BEC	happycoolness	hope someday I stop using the mouse too
2012-05-17T21:09:00.000Z	BEC	happycoolness	might u be able to help in this: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1979978 ?
2012-05-17T21:14:00.000Z	happycoolness	BEC	Hmmm I have no idea what is causing your problem there, but I don't know much about this sort of thing.
2012-05-17T21:15:00.000Z	BEC	happycoolness	never mind; thanks
