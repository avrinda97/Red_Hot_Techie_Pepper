2009-04-01T22:36:00.000Z	nvstp	PerryArmstrong	My advice is NO!
2009-04-01T22:37:00.000Z	nvstp	PerryArmstrong	You can have a try, but there may be some problem
2009-04-01T22:39:00.000Z	nvstp	PerryArmstrong	Many bugs with the 8.01 version?
2009-04-01T22:41:00.000Z	nvstp	PerryArmstrong	I think your system may be broken, your upgrading to 8.10 cannot resove these problems
2009-04-01T22:43:00.000Z	nvstp	PerryArmstrong	Oh, Now I see
2009-04-01T22:44:00.000Z	nvstp	PerryArmstrong	I think both of them are good, it depends on your administration on them
2009-04-01T22:45:00.000Z	nvstp	PerryArmstrong	your upgrading means reinstall or upgrade from 8.04?
2009-04-01T22:46:00.000Z	nvstp	PerryArmstrong	you may have a try
2009-04-01T22:46:00.000Z	nvstp	PerryArmstrong	but I advise that you can make a new install of 8.10

2009-04-01T22:50:00.000Z	nvstp	PerryArmstrong	you can give the result of "df"
2009-04-01T22:54:00.000Z	nvstp	PerryArmstrong	even so, you can only choose to upgrade to 8.10 now
2009-04-01T22:55:00.000Z	nvstp	PerryArmstrong	Because you only have on partition for Linux, and you don't want lost your data, so ...
