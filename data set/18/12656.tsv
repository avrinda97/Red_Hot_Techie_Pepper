2006-07-25T13:11:00.000Z	pinky_		Why isn't there an option to change bitdepth in the "Desktop --> Preferences --> Screen Resolution" dialogue box?
2006-07-25T13:11:00.000Z	pinky_		Is there a GUI way to change from 32-bit color to 16-bit color?
2006-07-25T13:13:00.000Z	pinky_		But I also set resolutions in xord.conf, but I can change them in the GUI if I want...
2006-07-25T13:13:00.000Z	pinky_		Wy can I not change through the bit depths I have set in xorg.conf like I can resolutions?
2006-07-25T13:13:00.000Z	pinky_		What, the resolutions?
2006-07-25T13:13:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	pinky_	yes.
2006-07-25T13:13:00.000Z	pinky_		Wrote them in?
2006-07-25T13:14:00.000Z	pinky_		I have multiple I can toggle through via the GUI in GNOME
2006-07-25T13:14:00.000Z	pinky_		But how can I make it so bit depth is switchable in the GUI?
2006-07-25T13:14:00.000Z	pinky_		I mean is this not even possible?
2006-07-25T13:14:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	pinky_	I am not aware of a way to change screen depth 'on the fly' only the resolution.
2006-07-25T13:14:00.000Z	pinky_		That seems silly that X would have to be completely restarted for a bit depth change.
2006-07-25T13:14:00.000Z	pinky_		Bad design IMO
2006-07-25T13:15:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	pinky_	its a server that is serving clients (multiple clients). So in that design, you don't just shift things like bitdepth (which can cause unpredictable results) on the fly.
2006-07-25T13:16:00.000Z	pinky_	fyrestrtr	Well why is resolution so easily switchable?  Seems just as risky to change on the fly as bit depth...
2006-07-25T13:16:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	pinky_	that's how I would justify it :) Its not bad design -- just a different way of doing things. X is a *server* and it serves many clients, one of which is gnome. You could have 15 people running any number of clients off of the same X server. So things like bitdepth -- which can cause things like artifacts -- are not easily switchable.
2006-07-25T13:17:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	pinky_	don't know about why, but its a good thing to research if you are so inclined.
2006-07-25T13:18:00.000Z	pinky_	fyrestrtr	I shall, but not now.  I want to get my game working =P
