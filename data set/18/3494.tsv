2011-11-08T18:16:00.000Z	llutz_	luca	you ever heard about "apt-get install foo"?
2011-11-08T18:17:00.000Z	luca	llutz_	no what is it? There are a lot of things in ubuntu
2011-11-08T18:18:00.000Z	llutz_	luca	you are not pinned down to the stuff being installed by default, just install additional stuff as you like. so why worry about things not in the default installation?
2011-11-08T18:20:00.000Z	llutz_	luca	its just another framework
2011-11-08T18:20:00.000Z	llutz_	luca	not fundamental at all, i hope
2011-11-08T18:20:00.000Z	luca	llutz_	have you got yhe list of all the frameworks?
2011-11-08T18:21:00.000Z	llutz_	luca	no
2011-11-08T18:22:00.000Z	llutz_	luca	easy: the distro comes without stuff but works, so it cannot be "fundamental".
2011-11-08T18:23:00.000Z	luca	llutz_	so what is the advantage to use that framework?
2011-11-08T18:23:00.000Z	llutz_	luca	its just a library used by some software
2011-11-08T18:26:00.000Z	llutz_	luca	if you don't even know what mono is, why do you care that it won't be in 12.04 by default?
2011-11-08T18:30:00.000Z	luca	llutz_	because i thought it was very important for more than 2 programs, I thought it was tha base of all operative system sorry
2011-11-15T19:24:00.000Z	llutz_	luca	#php might be the better place to ask
2011-11-15T23:16:00.000Z	llutz_	luca	 Do you have any ubuntu support related question?
2011-11-15T23:19:00.000Z	luca	llutz_	I'd like to know how can you use mysql on ubuntu
2011-11-15T23:20:00.000Z	llutz_	luca	install it, use it like on any other system
2011-11-15T23:21:00.000Z	luca	llutz_	I installed it on ubuntu but I don't know how I can use it
