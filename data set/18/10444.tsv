2006-12-28T10:35:00.000Z	klypso		hey
2006-12-28T10:36:00.000Z	klypso		I accidentally installed two of the same account on ubuntu, one a normal and the other a superuser
2006-12-28T10:36:00.000Z	klypso		when I log in, I log in as the lesser one
2006-12-28T10:36:00.000Z	klypso		how can I delete one?
2006-12-28T10:37:00.000Z	klypso		can anyone help?
2006-12-28T10:38:00.000Z	klypso		anyone know how to delete an account through the terminal?
2006-12-28T10:39:00.000Z	klypso		thanks
2006-12-28T10:41:00.000Z	klypso		how can I delete a user with the same name as another user?
2006-12-28T10:41:00.000Z	stefg	klypso	user-account have numbers... call it by uid, not by name
2006-12-28T10:42:00.000Z	klypso	stefg	where is the uid for the accounts?
2006-12-28T10:44:00.000Z	stefg	klypso	ermmm, did you try to delete the account you were logged in with?
2006-12-28T10:46:00.000Z	klypso	stefg	I accidentally created 2 accounts, one with admin privileges, one without.  I think I named them both 'ares' and when I log in, I have no admin privileges, so I think that I am logging into the lesser account.
2006-12-28T10:47:00.000Z	stefg	klypso	go to VT 1, login and : sudo init S... you are in maintenace mode then, perfect for deleting accounts
2006-12-28T10:47:00.000Z	klypso	stefg	: VT1?
2006-12-28T10:54:00.000Z	klypso	stefg	how can I exit that without shutting down?
2006-12-28T10:54:00.000Z	klypso	stefg	: what did you want me to try earlier?
2006-12-28T10:55:00.000Z	stefg	klypso	go to a non-X terminal, login, sudo init S... do your thing... init 2
2006-12-28T10:59:00.000Z	klypso	stefg	: can't get it to work
