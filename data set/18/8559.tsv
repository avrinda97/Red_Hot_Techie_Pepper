2007-08-02T16:57:00.000Z	CheeseGardener		what command do I need to edit this file?  sudo apt-get "what" /boot/grub/menu.lst???
2007-08-02T16:58:00.000Z	CheeseGardener		Compismyrx isn't the command irqpoll?
2007-08-02T16:58:00.000Z	CheeseGardener		or am I thinking something else?
2007-08-02T16:59:00.000Z	CheeseGardener		If anyone knows the command, what is the command for this, to open/edit:  sudo apt-get "what" /boot/grub/menu.lst?
2007-08-02T16:59:00.000Z	Pici	CheeseGardener	What are you trying to do?
2007-08-02T05:01:00.000Z	Pici	CheeseGardener	That command doesnt make sense. Are you trying to edit /boot/grub/menu.lst ??
2007-08-02T05:01:00.000Z	Pici	CheeseGardener	sudo nano /boot/grub/menu.lst
2007-08-02T05:03:00.000Z	CheeseGardener	Pici	how do I save it now?
2007-08-02T05:04:00.000Z	Pici	CheeseGardener	ctrl-o
2007-08-02T05:21:00.000Z	Pici	CheeseGardener	beryl, #ubuntu-effects for support on that
2007-08-03T07:02:00.000Z	Pici	CheeseGardener	Yes, fsck. which it automatically runs every 30 or so boots
2007-08-03T07:02:00.000Z	Pici	CheeseGardener	exactly :)
2007-08-03T07:03:00.000Z	Pici	CheeseGardener	You'll have to unmount your partitions first.
2007-08-03T07:06:00.000Z	Pici	CheeseGardener	sudo touch /forcefsck   to force it upon next boot
2007-08-03T07:08:00.000Z	Pici	CheeseGardener	It will do it the next time you boot, right at the beginning.
2007-08-03T07:08:00.000Z	Pici	CheeseGardener	Yep
2007-08-03T07:10:00.000Z	Pici	CheeseGardener	Because the forcefsck file doesnt exist. And it needs to exist for you to force fscking at the next boot
2007-08-03T07:11:00.000Z	Pici	CheeseGardener	Exactly.
