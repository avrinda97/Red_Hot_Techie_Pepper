2012-03-20T03:05:00.000Z	gdea73		^ I can't find the file libnpjp2.so. I thought that's what it was called...
2012-03-20T03:06:00.000Z	gdea73		64bit
2012-03-20T03:06:00.000Z	gdea73		I installed sun-java6-plugin, but I can't find the .so file to copy/link into Opera's plugin directory.
2012-03-20T03:08:00.000Z	gdea73		whoa weird
2012-03-20T03:08:00.000Z	gdea73		aww I don't want to do it manually, Quantum_Ion... lol
2012-03-20T03:08:00.000Z	gdea73		it should work fine installed by a package I just can't find the plugin file.
2012-03-20T03:08:00.000Z	gdea73		actually the JRE works fine, I just need the plugin.
2012-03-20T03:09:00.000Z	gdea73		java -version recognizes Sun Java the way I did it (installing from the ppa ppa:sun-java-community-team/sun-java)
2012-03-20T03:10:00.000Z	gdea73		except Quantum_Ion, I only want Java 6, and the JRE alone for now
2012-03-20T03:11:00.000Z	gdea73		well locate libnpjp2.so brought up nothing, but I'll check
2012-03-20T03:11:00.000Z	nyRednek	gdea73	it's under /usr/java
2012-03-20T03:11:00.000Z	gdea73	Quantum_Ion	well that assumes I installed Java 7, and manualy at that
2012-03-20T03:11:00.000Z	gdea73		I installed Java 6 via apt-get. I just can't find the plugin.
2012-03-20T03:11:00.000Z	gdea73		oh ok 1s
2012-03-20T03:12:00.000Z	gdea73		a lot of permission denied errors...
2012-03-20T03:12:00.000Z	gdea73		and no results, afaik
2012-03-20T03:12:00.000Z	gdea73		Never mind, got it, thanks Quantum_Ion.
2012-03-20T03:12:00.000Z	nyRednek	gdea73	yeah, find isn't the ideal way to get to your file
