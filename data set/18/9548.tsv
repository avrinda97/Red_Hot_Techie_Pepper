2007-03-22T14:45:00.000Z	iUbuntu		I've download an .rpm package, used alien to convert it to .deb format, and now when I run "alien -d the/name/of/the/file.deb I get this error ->
2007-03-22T14:45:00.000Z	iUbuntu		dpkg: error processing gaim_2.0.0-1_i386.deb (--install):

2007-03-22T14:46:00.000Z	Flannel	iUbuntu	Why don't you just use the GAIM in the repositories?
2007-03-22T14:50:00.000Z	Flannel	iUbuntu	What error?
2007-03-22T14:51:00.000Z	iUbuntu	Flannel	 I've just posted it above.
2007-03-22T14:52:00.000Z	Flannel	iUbuntu	oh, the package one?  -d is when you specify the path to the rpm file, not the deb file
2007-03-22T14:52:00.000Z	iUbuntu	Flannel	 alien -d converts a package that is in .rpm and converts it into .deb
2007-03-22T14:53:00.000Z	Flannel	iUbuntu	right, you give it the path to the rpm, your paste has a .deb file in there.
2007-03-22T14:53:00.000Z	iUbuntu	Flannel	my mistake ..  the/name/of/file.rpm
2007-03-23T16:53:00.000Z	Flannel	iUbuntu	Second link
2007-03-23T16:57:00.000Z	iUbuntu	Flannel	 in my own words, restricted is a free reserved software, right?
2007-03-23T16:58:00.000Z	Flannel	iUbuntu	Reserved?
2007-03-23T16:59:00.000Z	iUbuntu	Flannel	 reserved as in reserved software that is used commonly.
2007-03-23T05:00:00.000Z	Flannel	iUbuntu	eh?  restricted is stuff that isn't free but is supported
