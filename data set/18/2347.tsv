2010-07-04T07:38:00.000Z	gryllida		help! does unix style copy paste work in OOo for you, like middle click to paste, select to copy, it won't work here, how do I turn it on?
2010-07-04T07:38:00.000Z	gryllida		OOo doesn't have 'serif' and other system fonts listed in the dropdown
2010-07-04T07:39:00.000Z	gryllida		looks like it lacks integration with the system
2010-07-04T07:39:00.000Z	red2kic	gryllida	Ctrl + C / Ctrl + P works fine.
2010-07-04T07:40:00.000Z	gryllida	red2kic	I want the mouse (middleclicky) paste to work, use it a lot in emacs, terminal, firefox, ... want to turn it on in the word processor as well, very annoying when I middle click, find it fail, look around, and find out that this is because it's OOo
2010-07-04T07:41:00.000Z	gryllida	red2kic	it pastes from other apps to OOo, but no copying from OOo to anywhere, nomatter what block of text I select in OOo

2010-07-04T07:42:00.000Z	gryllida	red2kic	oh, please look into your fonts dropdown, are 'serif' and 'monospace' and other system fonts listed?
