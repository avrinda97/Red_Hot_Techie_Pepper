2012-02-14T19:58:00.000Z	amaroks		what is this process?
2012-02-14T19:59:00.000Z	amaroks		to me too
2012-02-14T19:59:00.000Z	amaroks		How can I find out where is that script running?
2012-02-14T20:00:00.000Z	amaroks		how
2012-02-14T20:00:00.000Z	amaroks		find xxx , what?
2012-02-14T20:02:00.000Z	amaroks		found it in /tmp/mirkforce/bash/sshbrute/ssh-brute
2012-02-14T20:02:00.000Z	amaroks		think deleting it and files for it will solve it?

2012-02-14T20:05:00.000Z	ikonia	amaroks	your machine is compromised, you need to re-install
2012-02-14T19:59:00.000Z	ikonia	amaroks	do a find on it
2012-02-14T20:00:00.000Z	ikonia	amaroks	you're going to have to probably re-install your OS as it looks like you have been compromised and are being used to do brute force attacks
2012-02-14T20:00:00.000Z	ikonia	amaroks	find / -name ssh-brute -print and then do the same on list.txt
2012-02-14T20:00:00.000Z	ikonia	amaroks	list.txt is probably in the same dir as ssh-brute
2012-02-14T20:07:00.000Z	ikonia	amaroks	it doesn't matter
2012-02-14T20:07:00.000Z	ikonia	amaroks	your machine is compromised, your next action is to re-install your OS
2012-02-14T20:08:00.000Z	ikonia	amaroks	it's up to you if you re-install or not, however your machine is compromised and may be removed from the network you are on if you are attacking other machines/spamming
