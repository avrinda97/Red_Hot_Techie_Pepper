2007-06-26T11:12:00.000Z	raddy		Hello Everybody
2007-06-26T11:13:00.000Z	raddy		I recently installed Ubuntu 7.04
2007-06-26T11:13:00.000Z	raddy		from live cd
2007-06-26T11:13:00.000Z	slavik_	raddy	state the problem, help will come faster
2007-06-26T11:13:00.000Z	raddy		now i am experiencing two problems
2007-06-26T11:14:00.000Z	raddy		1 > fsck running for windows filesystems too "everytime"
2007-06-26T11:14:00.000Z	slavik_	raddy	youa re being like some of my friends, who instroduce their problems for 5 minutes, which pisses me off, because they call me isntead of using IM ...
2007-06-26T11:14:00.000Z	slavik_	raddy	could you rephrase that?
2007-06-26T11:14:00.000Z	raddy		that increases the bootup time and comes out from graphical boot
2007-06-26T11:15:00.000Z	slavik_		fsck runs for windows volumes?
2007-06-26T11:15:00.000Z	raddy		1 > fsck running for windows filesystems too "everytime"
2007-06-26T11:15:00.000Z	slavik_		too = 2? or too = ,too ,
2007-06-26T11:16:00.000Z	slavik_		hmm, latter ... start by removing them from fstab I guess, or are they FAT(32)?
2007-06-26T11:16:00.000Z	raddy	slavik_	ok, fsck checking windows filesystems also in everyboot, that increases bootup time and comes out of graphical bot
2007-06-26T11:16:00.000Z	raddy		boot
2007-06-26T11:16:00.000Z	slavik_		or boot into windows to fix the ntfs journal (or wipe the mft like my winxp did)
2007-06-26T11:16:00.000Z	raddy		that problem not existed in live cd
2007-06-26T11:16:00.000Z	slavik_	raddy	betetr, sorry for being Major Hardass, but it's late and I am really tired. :P
