2007-11-07T02:58:00.000Z	stefg	kakoonia	google for an app called xhotkeys . Thta's not the only way, but the simplest
2007-11-07T02:59:00.000Z	kakoonia	stefg	isnt there some hotkey feature with gutsy?
2007-11-07T03:00:00.000Z	stefg	kakoonia	there's some labourious procedures within gnome .... just use  the separate xhotkeys daemon, it's much simpler and works in every desktop environment
2007-11-07T03:01:00.000Z	kakoonia	stefg	: thanks :D
2007-11-07T03:20:00.000Z	kakoonia	stefg	: i cant figure out how to download xhotkeys, i googled it, but every link i get is to the same site: http://www.nongnu.org/xhotkeys/index.html .. i dont understand how to install it from there.. can you help me out with this
2007-11-07T03:22:00.000Z	stefg	kakoonia	on that site you can download a .deb package (it's the same for debian and ubuntu). just click on it and gdebi will install it for you (just like that other OS does...:-) )
2007-11-07T03:23:00.000Z	kakoonia	stefg	realy, i cant find a file download.. ill check again.
2007-11-07T03:23:00.000Z	kakoonia	stefg	aha!! hehehe i need to click on the Debian logo! hehehe
2007-11-07T03:24:00.000Z	stefg	kakoonia	it was /too/ obvious it seems
2007-11-07T03:25:00.000Z	kakoonia	stefg	i guess, i just checked the links over there... Thanks bro.,
2007-11-07T03:27:00.000Z	stefg	kakoonia	after you have installed it you need to add xhotkeys -d to your session autostart
2007-11-07T03:28:00.000Z	kakoonia	stefg	just added it.. :)
