2008-07-07T23:49:00.000Z	illogic-al		I've a question for you all.
2008-07-07T23:50:00.000Z	illogic-al		i need to install on a computer without a ide drive, that has a sata drive.
2008-07-07T23:50:00.000Z	Fryguy--	illogic-al	ok, what is the problem
2008-07-07T23:50:00.000Z	Fryguy--	illogic-al	you'll have to locate drivers for your card then if it isn't detected by default
2008-07-07T23:51:00.000Z	illogic-al	Fryguy--	the drivers are included and ;oaded eith ubuntu
2008-07-07T23:51:00.000Z	Fryguy--	illogic-al	if so, then your drive is detected and you can just go ahead and install to it
2008-07-07T23:55:00.000Z	Fryguy--	illogic-al	the drive might be bad
2008-07-07T23:51:00.000Z	illogic-al	Fryguy--	no, the drive is not selected.
2008-07-07T23:52:00.000Z	Fryguy--	illogic-al	then you don't have a driver loaded for the card
2008-07-07T23:52:00.000Z	illogic-al	Fryguy--	the device is created, but root has no access to it.
2008-07-07T23:52:00.000Z	Fryguy--	illogic-al	explain
2008-07-07T23:52:00.000Z	illogic-al	Fryguy--	ok, let's say this pci card needs driver x. ubuntu has and loads driver x.
2008-07-07T23:53:00.000Z	illogic-al	Fryguy--	the /dev/sdX block is created. as the drive is new it need to be formatted to create partitions.
2008-07-07T23:54:00.000Z	illogic-al	Fryguy--	doing 'sudo fdisk /dev/sdX' or 'sudo cfdisk /dev/sdX' does nothing. an error is thrown up saying the drive cannot be accessed.
2008-07-07T23:54:00.000Z	Fryguy--	illogic-al	are you sure the drive is good?
2008-07-07T23:55:00.000Z	illogic-al	Fryguy--	no, i'm not sure at all. i just know that the driver listed should support the card.
2008-07-07T23:55:00.000Z	illogic-al	Fryguy--	hum. had not thought of that.
