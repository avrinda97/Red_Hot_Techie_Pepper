2011-03-08T00:54:00.000Z	jotbe	Phase	%k in $DATE?
2011-03-08T00:57:00.000Z	Phase	jotbe	Hmm, is that not supposed to be there? /me double checks `man date`
2011-03-08T00:57:00.000Z	Phase	jotbe	The manpage has it listed as: %k  hour ( 0..23)
2011-03-08T00:59:00.000Z	jotbe	Phase	sorry, didn't have a look at the man page. (not logged into ubuntu right now)
2011-03-08T00:59:00.000Z	Phase	jotbe	ah
2011-03-08T00:59:00.000Z	Phase	jotbe	thanks for trying at least
2011-03-08T01:00:00.000Z	jotbe	Phase	how often does it occur?
2011-03-08T01:01:00.000Z	Phase	jotbe	The cronjob has it run at 1:30am and 1:30pm every day, and so far it seems to be the morning ones that get the filename wrong
2011-03-08T01:02:00.000Z	Phase	jotbe	As far as testing it goes, this is twice it's happened out of 4 times of letting cron run the script
2011-03-08T01:02:00.000Z	jotbe	Phase	what about putting the path and file param in double quotes?
2011-03-08T01:03:00.000Z	Phase	jotbe	Hmm, there's no spaces in any of the directory or filenames, but I'll definitely try it
2011-03-08T01:03:00.000Z	jotbe	Phase	just a general hint to avoid issues with command args
2011-03-08T01:03:00.000Z	Phase	jotbe	Alright, thanks :)
2011-03-08T01:04:00.000Z	jotbe	Phase	you might try with a small one-liner script to catch the issue. or did you already?
2011-03-08T01:05:00.000Z	Phase	jotbe	I'm going to try that next actually
2011-03-08T01:06:00.000Z	jotbe	Phase	create the $DATE in the same way as in the script and echo it. then create the $DATE with the time of both crontab triggers :)
2011-03-08T01:06:00.000Z	Phase	jotbe	Alright, thanks for the suggestions
2011-03-08T01:07:00.000Z	jotbe	Phase	maybe with +/-1 or 2min
