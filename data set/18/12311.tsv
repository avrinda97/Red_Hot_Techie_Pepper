2007-07-17T08:36:00.000Z	mc44	LiNuX_Fr3aK	the ubuntu repos should be fine. Make sure you have security repos enabled

2007-07-17T08:43:00.000Z	mc44	LiNuX_Fr3aK	check in you source.list for feisty securty
2007-07-17T08:44:00.000Z	mc44	LiNuX_Fr3aK	/etc/apt/sources.list
2007-07-17T08:46:00.000Z	mc44	LiNuX_Fr3aK	you should have a line like "deb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu feisty-security main restricted universe"
