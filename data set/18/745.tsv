2012-10-15T00:47:00.000Z	Cong		Is it possible to telnet to the same computer running telnetd?
2012-10-15T00:47:00.000Z	nibbier	Cong	sure
2012-10-15T00:48:00.000Z	Cong	nibbier	telnet replies with unable to connect. help me.
2012-10-15T00:52:00.000Z	nibbier	Cong	well.. 1st you should not use telnet. use ssh instead. if you need telnet to be running, make sure the process is up or xinetd/inetd is up and properly configured=
2012-10-15T00:55:00.000Z	Cong	nibbier	inetd is running. I telnet to 127.0.0.1 23 but it does not connect. How do I set it up?
2012-10-15T00:56:00.000Z	nibbier	Cong	for me it was just "sudo apt-get install telnetd"
2012-10-15T00:56:00.000Z	Cong	nibbier	I have installed inetd and inetutils-inetd.
2012-10-15T00:58:00.000Z	Cong	nibbier	I meant I have installed inetutils-inetd and inetutils-telnetd.
2012-10-15T01:00:00.000Z	Cong	nibbier	how do I check it telnetd is running?
2012-10-15T01:04:00.000Z	nibbier	Cong	ps waxl|grep telnet
2012-10-15T01:06:00.000Z	nibbier	Cong	there is no real reason to use telnet anymore, ssh can do all of telnet plus much more, and its save for free
2012-10-15T01:09:00.000Z	nibbier	Cong	did you install the telnetd package?
2012-10-15T01:09:00.000Z	Cong	nibbier	what's this mean? http://paste.ubuntu.com/1280006/
2012-10-15T01:10:00.000Z	Cong	nibbier	yes telnetd is installed.
2012-10-15T01:12:00.000Z	nibbier	Cong	that means telnet is not running. and considering your general knowledge i once again want to encourage you to use ssh, sudo apt-get install openssh-server and you are done
2012-10-15T01:14:00.000Z	nibbier	Cong	which is because its deprecated, old, useless and insecure, why would anyone write about it?
2012-10-15T01:30:00.000Z	Cong	nibbier	my computer is rejecting telnet 127.0.0.1. But when I did telnet localhost it started connecting. What's the problem?
2012-10-15T01:30:00.000Z	Cong	nibbier	that's not the problem.
