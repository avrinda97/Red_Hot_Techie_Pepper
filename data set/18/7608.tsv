2007-12-09T11:55:00.000Z	spolvid		Does anyone know how to install Ubuntu on a Mac without erasing the contents of the disc it's being installed on?
2007-12-09T11:55:00.000Z	spolvid		I don't have anything to backup to though.. :(
2007-12-09T11:55:00.000Z	spolvid		Running 10.4
2007-12-09T11:56:00.000Z	musashi	spolvid	yeah, i did that. you have to use the mac tools to partiton first like for installing windows
2007-12-09T11:56:00.000Z	spolvid		Yes, but partitioning will erase what's on the disc, right?
2007-12-09T11:57:00.000Z	spolvid		Hm.
2007-12-09T11:57:00.000Z	musashi	spolvid	try http://ubuntu-tutorials.com/2007/08/02/installing-ubuntu-on-a-macbook-tutorial-beta/
2007-12-09T11:57:00.000Z	spolvid		I don't have anything to backup onto is the thing.
2007-12-09T11:58:00.000Z	musashi	spolvid	you don't "need" to backup. the boot camp stuff should work. but if it doesn't well...
2007-12-09T11:58:00.000Z	spolvid		Ah.
2007-12-09T11:58:00.000Z	spolvid		Can you thing of anything else to use?
2007-12-09T11:59:00.000Z	musashi	spolvid	i followed that how to (or maybe it was the one in the wiki) and it worked fine. first step is let OSX create the partition. second step, don't install ubuntu on the first partition :)
2007-12-09T12:00:00.000Z	spolvid	musashi	you mean making the partition in Boot Camp, right?
2007-12-09T12:01:00.000Z	musashi	spolvid	yeah, use boot camp to set it up. it thinks you are going to install windows. ignore that. just create the parition and then install ubuntu to THAT partition
2007-12-09T12:02:00.000Z	spolvid		Hm. This might be tricky, I don't have Leopard and I never installed Boot Camp when it was public. I'll figure something out.
2007-12-09T12:02:00.000Z	spolvid		Thanks though.
2007-12-09T12:02:00.000Z	spolvid		Bye.
2007-12-09T12:02:00.000Z	musashi	spolvid	i did it with 10.4
