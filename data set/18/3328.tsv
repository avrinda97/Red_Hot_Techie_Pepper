2009-10-27T22:33:00.000Z	xpololz		hey! im pretty new to ubuntu, ive installed the recommended nvidia drivers (NVIDIA accelerated graphics driver (180)) but it seems its still very slow at rendering 2d graphics. Can anyone help me with this please?
2009-10-27T22:33:00.000Z	macmouse	xpololz	are you using the open source driver, or the proprietary driver?
2009-10-27T22:34:00.000Z	xpololz		im just using the nvidia driver that was reccomended from system>administration>hardware drivers
2009-10-27T22:35:00.000Z	xpololz	macmouse	im just using the nvidia driver that was reccomended from system>administration>hardware drivers**
2009-10-27T22:35:00.000Z	macmouse	xpololz	unless you had clicked on a box saying you are allowing non-open source drivers, then it is the OSS one (which tends to be slower)
2009-10-27T22:36:00.000Z	xpololz	macmouse	thanks i'll check that out!
2009-10-27T22:37:00.000Z	macmouse	xpololz	generally, there is a separate menu item or something that you have to select, to explicitly allow either (third party, proprietary or non-open source) drivers
2009-10-27T22:37:00.000Z	macmouse		I'm not at a ubuntu machine ATM
2009-10-27T22:37:00.000Z	macmouse		so this is just memory
2009-10-27T22:40:00.000Z	xpololz	macmouse	i have that choise if i go to Applications->add/remove, but i didnt use any items from there, i just went to system->administration->hardware drivers and installed the nvidia drivers reccomended
2009-10-27T22:42:00.000Z	macmouse	xpololz	I know there is a bunch of guides out there on how to do it..
2009-10-27T22:42:00.000Z	macmouse		ah!
2009-10-27T22:42:00.000Z	macmouse		its called restricted drivers
