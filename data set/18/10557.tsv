2006-11-16T14:41:00.000Z	jediMaster		omg, just installed beryl.Restarted but i get the brown(?) screen after the login.PC disk busy, but nothing else.HELP
2006-11-16T14:42:00.000Z	sky123	jediMaster	might wanna try to ctrl-alt-bkspc then if you made a copy of the xorg.conf file to something like xorg.conf.old then you can replace it, reboot and try again...to see if you get it restored.. to what it was..
2006-11-16T14:43:00.000Z	jediMaster	sky123	i cant do anything it hangs booting into x after the login
2006-11-16T14:44:00.000Z	sky123	jediMaster	before you log in...id try the ctrl-alt-bkspc to get to shell... then replace the xorg.conf.old file to xorg.conf...you DID make a copy to old of the original file right??
2006-11-16T14:45:00.000Z	jediMaster	sky123	i did
2006-11-16T14:46:00.000Z	sky123	jediMaster	that was yes you made a copy? or yes youve already replaced it..and it still blows up
2006-11-16T14:46:00.000Z	jediMaster	sky123	my bad - yes i did make a copy, ill try replacing it. Thanks
2006-11-16T14:47:00.000Z	sky123	jediMaster	thats the first step...then get the damn thing restored...re-trace your steps trhough the how to for beryl and see if it is missing something..

2006-11-16T14:48:00.000Z	sky123	jediMaster	when i did an upgrade on my dapper...it broke a lot of shi** ...but when i did a fresh install of edgy...wham fixed.
2006-11-16T14:49:00.000Z	sky123	jediMaster	once you get it working...youll like beryl..its pretty pimp
2006-11-16T14:50:00.000Z	jediMaster	sky123	uncanny. I had a working xgl on dapper, but the upgrade was messy, so fresh installed edgy, automatix2 put on the nvid driver .8xxxx .
