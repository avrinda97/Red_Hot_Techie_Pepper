2012-10-24T09:36:00.000Z	soc42		hi #ubuntu
2012-10-24T09:37:00.000Z	soc42		i did a fresh install of ubuntu 12.04 in a vmware box and now i wonder how to install the vmware tools...
2012-10-24T09:37:00.000Z	Scott_S	soc42	sudo apt-get install open-vm-tools
2012-10-24T09:37:00.000Z	Scott_S	soc42	I'm not annoyed at all. :) Just a friendly greeting.
2012-10-24T09:39:00.000Z	soc42	Scott_S	thank you very much! i really prefer beeing friendly at all
2012-10-24T09:39:00.000Z	Scott_S	soc42	You are very welcome, I am glad it worked.
2012-10-24T09:43:00.000Z	soc42	Scott_S	yup. vmware tools installed successfully, thanksalot
2012-10-24T09:43:00.000Z	Scott_S	soc42	You're welcome.
2012-10-24T09:45:00.000Z	Scott_S	soc42	Press the Windows key and type in 'Keyboard Layout'
2012-10-24T09:50:00.000Z	soc42	Scott_S	sorry, didn't work changing the keyboard locale with your hint
2012-10-24T09:51:00.000Z	Scott_S	soc42	That's very odd, as that is the locale settings area... Let me check some more stuff then.
2012-10-24T09:52:00.000Z	Scott_S	soc42	Is it because the locale you are looking for is not listed?
2012-10-24T09:54:00.000Z	soc42	Scott_S	i guess i'll have to install additional ones first, but how?
2012-10-24T09:54:00.000Z	Scott_S	soc42	One moment, I'll check.
2012-10-24T09:55:00.000Z	Scott_S	soc42	Under the 'Keyboard Layout' menu, there is a Plus (+) sign. Click on that to view a list of locales.
2012-10-24T09:56:00.000Z	soc42	Scott_S	oh wait... are your hints targeting Unity Desktop Environment? i am still in CLI mode, didn't install any X-Window yet
2012-10-24T10:07:00.000Z	soc42	Scott_S	to change the default keyboard to match your local keyboard, use:  sudo dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration
2012-10-24T10:09:00.000Z	soc42	Scott_S	now all keystrokes showup in CLI as expected â€“ what certainly helps a lot - much better than guessing ;o)
