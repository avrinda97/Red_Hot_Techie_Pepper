2008-03-23T11:36:00.000Z	kindofabuzz		i've never seen an option to share /home during install, you talking about ubuntu??
2008-03-23T11:38:00.000Z	kindofabuzz		no one shhould be able to Smegzor, unless they have admin rights
2008-03-23T11:39:00.000Z	kindofabuzz		netham, why are you in a linux channel then?
2008-03-23T11:39:00.000Z	kindofabuzz		well windows must have been shitty if you have to reinstall
2008-03-23T11:40:00.000Z	kindofabuzz		i set up a simple NFS share, how come i can delete all files in it on the client but i can't edit a file on the client that was made on the server?
2008-03-23T11:41:00.000Z	kindofabuzz		no, on server i'm 1001, on client i'm 1000, but how did i have permission to delete them?
2008-03-23T11:42:00.000Z	kindofabuzz		i guess when a file is written to the export folder it's actually transfered to the client?
2008-03-23T11:42:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn	kindofabuzz	Yes
2008-03-23T11:43:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn	kindofabuzz	Well... No.. sorry.. it's written to the server, but the client has access to it immediately due to the nfs mount
2008-03-23T11:44:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn	kindofabuzz	as kenboo said.. Your UIDs have to match.. not just the names
2008-03-23T11:45:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn	kindofabuzz	That would be very rare, but possible, yes... If you have write access but not read then you'd be able to delete it, but not open it
2008-03-23T12:43:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn	kindofabuzz	I was one of them, yeah
2008-03-23T12:44:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn	kindofabuzz	How did you change it?
2008-03-23T12:47:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn	kindofabuzz	You forgot the -U switch

2008-03-23T12:48:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn	kindofabuzz	Pay special attention to the "changing ownership of files with obsolete uid" section :)
2008-03-23T12:49:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn	kindofabuzz	For that matter.. You may want to, just in case, create a copy of your home directory "sudo cp /home/jason /home/jason.old"
2008-03-23T13:11:00.000Z	FourX4Luvn	kindofabuzz	'sudo apt-get install cairo-clock'
