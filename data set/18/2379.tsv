2010-12-14T12:20:00.000Z	hanasaki		ah
2010-12-14T12:20:00.000Z	hanasaki		dropbox looks commercial it sends files through the dropbox.com site?
2010-12-14T12:22:00.000Z	hanasaki		:(
2010-12-14T12:23:00.000Z	hanasaki		coda and the andrew file system?
2010-12-14T12:24:00.000Z	hanasaki		ok
2010-12-14T12:24:00.000Z	hanasaki		maco... yes.. but only on my laptop right?  not to some other company's server
2010-12-14T12:25:00.000Z	hanasaki		http://www.coda.cs.cmu.edu/mirrors.html
2010-12-14T12:26:00.000Z	hanasaki		cool maco - so what is AFS AFS2 openAFS and coda... what's alive?dead? better for what?
2010-12-14T12:26:00.000Z	i8degrees	hanasaki	glusterfs is cool in my book :] been using it as part of a two node RAID 1+0 disk cluster
2010-12-14T12:26:00.000Z	hanasaki	i8degrees	I will check that out.. never heard of it
2010-12-14T12:28:00.000Z	i8degrees	hanasaki	perhaps even better than glusterfs, for your needs, would be DRBD
2010-12-14T12:30:00.000Z	i8degrees	hanasaki	naturally. it's RAID1 over the network at the kernel level
2010-12-14T12:31:00.000Z	i8degrees	hanasaki	does not require a special filesystem, either. for the record, glusterfs does not require a special filesystem either. aka both fit into your existing filesystem solution or extends upon
2010-12-14T12:31:00.000Z	hanasaki	i8degrees	slow w/o fiber LOL
2010-12-14T12:32:00.000Z	i8degrees	hanasaki	not true! gigabit :]
2010-12-14T12:32:00.000Z	hanasaki	i8degrees	giga still would be slow for heavy use of sectors over ehternet
2010-12-14T12:33:00.000Z	i8degrees	hanasaki	initial replication can, of course, take a long minute, but incremental updates are generally quick
2010-12-14T12:34:00.000Z	i8degrees	hanasaki	depends on your needs, of course, but *shrug* plenty of potential solutions either way
