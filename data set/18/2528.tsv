2011-01-19T23:23:00.000Z	ZenMasta		I need help deleting a folder, it says operation not permitted http://pastie.org/1478054
2011-01-19T23:24:00.000Z	rumpe1	ZenMasta	"sudo rm -r stuff"
2011-01-19T23:25:00.000Z	ZenMasta	rumpe1	I'm already root
2011-01-19T23:25:00.000Z	rumpe1	ZenMasta	is the partition read-only mounted?
2011-01-19T23:26:00.000Z	ZenMasta	rumpe1	I don tknow really, this is a new server, all the old files that were replaced got put in this old folder and I'm just trying to all the old stuff
2011-01-19T23:26:00.000Z	rumpe1	ZenMasta	check output of "mount"
2011-01-19T23:27:00.000Z	rumpe1	ZenMasta	or put it in a pastebin, if this doesn't solve the problem already
2011-01-19T23:27:00.000Z	ZenMasta	rumpe1	http://pastie.org/1478107
2011-01-19T23:28:00.000Z	rumpe1	ZenMasta	so it's on /-partition?
2011-01-19T23:29:00.000Z	ZenMasta	rumpe1	its a virtual private server so I'm not really sure how that works
2011-01-19T23:29:00.000Z	rumpe1	ZenMasta	try "rm -rf stuff"
2011-01-19T23:30:00.000Z	ZenMasta	rumpe1	same results as rm -r stuff
2011-01-19T23:31:00.000Z	rumpe1	ZenMasta	hmm... maby "rm -rfv stuff" gives more informations?
2011-01-19T23:31:00.000Z	ZenMasta	rumpe1	no same thing still
2011-01-19T23:32:00.000Z	rumpe1		msanger, tail -f /var/log/messages
2011-01-19T23:32:00.000Z	rumpe1	ZenMasta	sorry... have no clue
2011-01-19T23:35:00.000Z	ZenMasta	rumpe1	thanks anyway
2011-01-19T23:36:00.000Z	ZenMasta	rumpe1	that was the last folder that didn't delete. there's nothing important in it anyway and its not relevant in file size so I"ll just ignore it
