2007-12-22T08:55:00.000Z	mongo1		its not on the ubuntu download page
2007-12-22T08:57:00.000Z	pg	mongo1	google for it
2007-12-22T08:59:00.000Z	mongo1	pg	ok i got the md5sum code... now what do i do make a txt file and put it in there with an extension .md5?
2007-12-22T09:00:00.000Z	pg	mongo1	if you are running Linux already, open a terminal and type "md5sum FILE" where FILE is the file you downloaded.  That calculates the md5sum of the file.  If you are running Windows, search the web for a Windows program to do that.
2007-12-22T09:01:00.000Z	mongo1	pg	i did i got this link http://www.linuxquestions.org/linux/answers/LQ_ISO/Checking_the_md5sum_in_Windows
2007-12-22T09:01:00.000Z	mongo1	pg	im at the step "md5sum -c filename.md5"
2007-12-22T09:05:00.000Z	pg	mongo1	sorry, I did know that's how this program worked.  Apparently, you put the md5 of the correct file in a file and execture "md5sum -c filename.md5" and it should calculate the md5sums of all the iso files.  You should also be able to just make it calculate the md5 of the file and compare it visually to the correct one.
2007-12-22T09:07:00.000Z	mongo1	pg	it outputted a md5 key and the iso file name
2007-12-22T09:09:00.000Z	mongo1	pg	do i see if that number/letters it gave me match the one i found online and if so then that means im all good to burn it?
2007-12-22T09:09:00.000Z	pg	mongo1	yep
2007-12-22T09:10:00.000Z	pg	mongo1	sometimes. If you have burned it once already and it does not seem to work, try copying it from the CDROM onto a new image file using rawrite.exe, then compare the md5sum of that file
2007-12-22T09:11:00.000Z	pg	mongo1	the new image file would be a file on your hard drive.
2007-12-22T09:11:00.000Z	mongo1	pg	ehhh you mean create a new iso image from whats on the cd?
2007-12-22T09:12:00.000Z	pg	mongo1	yes.  that way you can check if it is correctly written and read from the CD
2007-12-22T09:14:00.000Z	pg	mongo1	I'm not sure if rawrite is the right program.
2007-12-22T09:22:00.000Z	pg	mongo1	I can't find a program that will read a CD and create an ISO image file.  Just try writing the file to CD again.
2007-12-22T15:47:00.000Z	pg	mongo1	if already have data on your Vista partition, you can copy it to another disk, partition and possibly re-install vista and copy your data
2007-12-22T15:47:00.000Z	pg	mongo1	if you don't have data, just resize the partition and reinstall Vista if you have to
