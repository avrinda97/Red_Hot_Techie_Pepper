2010-10-04T07:25:00.000Z	collosi	mamece2	 just install bt4 over windows
2010-10-04T07:26:00.000Z	collosi	mamece2	 do you want to keep your current installation of ubuntu?
2010-10-04T07:26:00.000Z	collosi	mamece2	 You can have both installed no problem, you can even share the swap I believe if you so desire
2010-10-04T07:27:00.000Z	mamece2	collosi	i wanted to shrink windows partition and augment the ubuntu one
2010-10-04T07:27:00.000Z	collosi	mamece2	 I though you wanted to only have bt4 and ubuntu?
2010-10-04T07:28:00.000Z	collosi	mamece2	 you want to resize your NTFS partions and increase your linux one correct?
2010-10-04T07:28:00.000Z	mamece2	collosi	is taht possible?
2010-10-04T07:29:00.000Z	collosi	mamece2	sure, but I dont know how safe it is, I havent resized a windows partion in many years
2010-10-04T07:29:00.000Z	collosi	mamece2	 use gparted
2010-10-04T07:30:00.000Z	collosi	mamece2	 then install it on ubuntu
2010-10-04T07:30:00.000Z	collosi	mamece2	 you do have a dual boot already right?
2010-10-04T07:33:00.000Z	collosi	mamece2	 why can't you mount the partition?
2010-10-06T06:13:00.000Z	mamece2	collosi	about?
