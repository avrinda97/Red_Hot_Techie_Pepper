2006-11-02T14:52:00.000Z	Badkitty	jordan	ok jordan
2006-11-02T15:05:00.000Z	jordan	Badkitty	Possibly
2006-11-02T15:05:00.000Z	jordan	Badkitty	What kind is it?
2006-11-02T15:07:00.000Z	jordan	Badkitty	If it is a broadcom card, I can help, otherwise all I can suggest is to try installing restricted modules.
2006-11-02T15:08:00.000Z	jordan	Badkitty	Try: sudo apt-get install linux-restricted-modules-generic
2006-11-02T15:09:00.000Z	jordan	Badkitty	You may need to add the restricted repository to install linux-restricted-modules-generic
2006-11-02T15:10:00.000Z	jordan	Badkitty	Ok, you can download the .debs and transfer them to a flash drive ( note this is just a stab in the dark anyways )
2006-11-02T15:12:00.000Z	jordan	Badkitty	Basically, installing the restricted modules will only help if there are proprietary linux drivers for your card ( that is the case for me )
2006-11-02T15:13:00.000Z	jordan	Badkitty	Other than that I can't help.
2006-11-02T15:15:00.000Z	jordan	Badkitty	Do you have another ubuntu machine that can connect?
2006-11-02T15:17:00.000Z	jordan	Badkitty	never mind, it can be a windows machine also if you download from packages.ubuntu.com
