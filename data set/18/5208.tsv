2009-02-06T15:42:00.000Z	ubuntu__		please correct me if i have the wrong logic. i am currently inside ubuntu live 8.04 and i want to do a fsck on a unmounted drive... what would i type
2009-02-06T15:42:00.000Z	ubuntu__		i think i tried that, thans
2009-02-06T15:43:00.000Z	mrwes	ubuntu__	did you try man fsck ? :)
2009-02-06T15:44:00.000Z	ubuntu__	mrwes	no.. i did what u just said thought and it comes back as this 'he wrong logic. i am currently inside ubuntu live 8.04 and i want to do a fsck on a unmounted drive... what would i type...'
2009-02-06T15:45:00.000Z	ubuntu__	mrwes	would i use ur example if i dont have a filesystem on the disk
2009-02-06T15:45:00.000Z	mrwes	ubuntu__	hrmm...from what I know, fsck /dev/xxx should work
2009-02-06T15:46:00.000Z	mrwes	ubuntu__	it's formated ext2 or 3?
2009-02-06T15:46:00.000Z	ubuntu__		its not formated
2009-02-06T15:46:00.000Z	ubuntu__		i delted the partitions
2009-02-06T15:46:00.000Z	mrwes		Oh...........
2009-02-06T15:46:00.000Z	ubuntu__		i think thats the problem though, but im pretty sure i can run fsck on a unformated drive
2009-02-06T15:47:00.000Z	ubuntu__		i prob need a -something
2009-02-06T15:47:00.000Z	mrwes	ubuntu__	hrmm...fsck (files system check) I believe is for formatted drives
2009-02-06T15:48:00.000Z	mrwes	ubuntu__	think about it; you don't have a file system on the drive, right?
2009-02-06T15:48:00.000Z	ubuntu__	mrwes	would i make sence for me to create a partition, run the scan, than delete the partiton on my next install which will be after my disk check
2009-02-06T15:49:00.000Z	mrwes	ubuntu__	that's what I would do
2009-02-06T15:49:00.000Z	ubuntu__	mrwes	no file system yet... drive was problematic, so i deleted all partitions, and ran a spinrite check which is program which fixes bad clustors/sectors whatever they are
2009-02-06T15:49:00.000Z	ubuntu__	mrwes	looks like ur opinion is the best one and the only one
