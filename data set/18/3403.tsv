2010-03-07T05:29:00.000Z	Fernandos		hi
2010-03-07T05:30:00.000Z	Fernandos		I bought a tablet pc and it has a ATI Radeon HD4550, does that work with 3D and ubuntu??
2010-03-07T05:30:00.000Z	Fernandos		and it  has a internal graphics card too: Intel GS45 I don't know more. sorry
2010-03-07T05:31:00.000Z	Fernandos		Maybe you know more than I do.. I bought a HP TouchSmart TM2
2010-03-07T05:33:00.000Z	Fernandos		does somebody of you know if I can use a multitouch tablet with ubuntu??
2010-03-07T05:34:00.000Z	Fernandos		I don't speak about the touchpad. I speak about the display
2010-03-07T05:35:00.000Z	froh	Fernandos	have you even tried to google it?
2010-03-07T05:36:00.000Z	Fernandos	froh	yes. I only find results about the touchpad
2010-03-07T05:38:00.000Z	froh	Fernandos	http://ubuntu-snippets.blogspot.com/2009/03/multi-touch-for-anyall-synaptics.html
2010-03-07T05:38:00.000Z	Fernandos	froh	NOT the touchpad. My display has multitouch
2010-03-07T05:38:00.000Z	Fernandos	froh	ok. both have multitouch.
2010-03-07T05:39:00.000Z	Fernandos	froh	all I found is what you found + howto compile xy... which doesn't sound like an easy solution..
2010-03-07T05:40:00.000Z	Fernandos	froh	this is what I bought.. http://www.engadget.com/2010/01/06/hp-touchsmart-tm2-convertible-tablet-slims-down-and-spruces-up/
2010-03-07T05:40:00.000Z	froh	Fernandos	the sad truth is that progress on the mainstream linux desktop is mostly driven by copying someone else's features
2010-03-07T05:41:00.000Z	Fernandos	froh	ok.. in which relation is this to multitouch? sry didn't get what you say
2010-03-07T05:42:00.000Z	froh	Fernandos	it means youll have to wait until someone copies the fetures of iphone , osx ,win7 or wht ever
2010-03-07T05:43:00.000Z	Fernandos	froh	ah.. ok
2010-03-07T05:45:00.000Z	froh	Fernandos	yes this is why this year wont be the year of the linux desktop either
