2006-11-28T09:31:00.000Z	DevC		yeah no doubt... that is why for windows (requird for college course BS in GSP) i went from 95/98 to XPsp2 for the fact that they were unstable now I do my programming on Ubuntu and my course work on Xp
2006-11-28T09:33:00.000Z	DevC		I was mad I tried to upgrade to 6.06 and when I did xserver wouldn't configure properly so I had to reinstall 5.04 and try again and pray that xserver doesn't mess up again on 6.06
2006-11-28T09:34:00.000Z	Flannel	DevC	You need to upgrade to 5.10 before going to 6.06, that's probably why.
2006-11-28T09:34:00.000Z	Flannel	DevC	although, if you're on a fresh install of 5.04, you might as well just do a fresh install of 6.06
2006-11-28T09:35:00.000Z	Flannel	DevC	why not just download a 6.10 CD?
2006-11-28T09:36:00.000Z	DevC	Flannel	well I can't burn the iso no more room on my laptop to d/l and burn ISO....all my MS/Macromedia/adobe  software for my college course has filled up my entire 60 gig hdd
2006-11-28T09:36:00.000Z	Flannel	DevC	heh.  Grab the small (<10Mb) netinstall CD then.
2006-11-28T09:37:00.000Z	Flannel	DevC	http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/edgy/main/installer-i386/current/images/netboot/ 8.4Mb, surely you can find room for that ;)  It'll save you about 3Gb of downloading too ;)
2006-11-28T09:37:00.000Z	Flannel	DevC	or, 1.5Gb, even.  I can add, honest.
2006-11-28T09:38:00.000Z	DevC	Flannel	lol I would if I had more than 4MB of space left....I have to put back money to get an external usb HDD in order to save any work I do with my courses right now all my work and stuff is spread across about 40 or 50 floppies right now
2006-11-28T09:39:00.000Z	Flannel	DevC	Uh, if you can't spare 8.4Mb, ... clear your cache or something.  Email a few files to a gmail account or something.
2006-11-28T09:42:00.000Z	DevC	Flannel	XP is requied by my college (anti-linux) so ubuntu is only for me to bone up on my php/mysql web dev and c/c++ programming while I do everything else on xp.....when I get the external HDD (plan to get an 80 gig or higher) I plan to copy most of the stuff to the external so I can use it anywhere until then I'm just going to do it throug the uncertain upgrade methods the site outlines
2006-11-28T09:42:00.000Z	Flannel	DevC	er... So, where is ubuntu installed currently then?
2006-11-28T09:44:00.000Z	Flannel	DevC	so, can't you download the CD to your desktop? and install it there?  I'm... confused.  Can't you transfer a file or two to your desktop to download 9mbs worth of CD?
2006-11-29T08:41:00.000Z	Flannel	DevC	it has nothing to do with the DCC itself, just that string of text.  But, this is offtopic.
2006-11-29T08:43:00.000Z	DevC	Flannel	what are the other Ubuntu channels?
2006-11-29T08:44:00.000Z	Flannel	DevC	well, for questions like that, theres #ubuntu-offtopic ;)
2006-11-29T08:44:00.000Z	Flannel	DevC	theres a list on the wiki, or you can just ask chanserv (/msg chanserv list #ubuntu*)
