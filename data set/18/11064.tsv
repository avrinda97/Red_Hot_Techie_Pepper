2006-09-20T15:16:00.000Z	drumline		ubuntu's grub doesn't have reiserfs capability natively does it?
2006-09-20T15:17:00.000Z	Empty	drumline	use ext2 for /boot, then reiser wherever you need it
2006-09-20T15:18:00.000Z	Empty	drumline	I would only use reiser if you have a clear and documented need for it
2006-09-20T15:20:00.000Z	drumline	Empty	ahh ok..  is that because reiserfs is so new?
2006-09-20T15:20:00.000Z	drumline	Empty	I was having trouble getting grub to embed the reiserfs_stage1_5 even when I was specifying a prefix directory...  crazy
2006-09-20T15:21:00.000Z	drumline	Empty	dayam...   I guess I'll be using ext3  :)
2006-09-20T15:21:00.000Z	drumline	Empty	is SUSE jumping the gun then by making reiserfs the default?
2006-09-20T15:21:00.000Z	Empty	drumline	Yeah... SUSE tends to make bizarre against-the-current-thought decisions like that
2006-09-20T15:22:00.000Z	drumline	Empty	I've noticed..   They were getting slammed by the redhat guys for jumping onto the Xen boat a bit too soon.
2006-09-20T15:22:00.000Z	drumline	Empty	How small?  :)   like 1k?
2006-09-20T15:23:00.000Z	drumline	Empty	nice
2006-09-20T15:23:00.000Z	Empty	drumline	Like a few meg
2006-09-20T15:23:00.000Z	drumline	Empty	from what I've been able to tell, there are more tools for diagnosing and repairing ext3, is that correct?
2006-09-20T15:24:00.000Z	Empty	drumline	oodles more
2006-09-20T15:24:00.000Z	drumline	Empty	yeah...  I'll be installing this next one with ext3.  Thanks.  :)
2006-09-20T15:26:00.000Z	drumline	Empty	thx for all the data...  very helpful stuff.
2006-09-20T15:27:00.000Z	Empty	drumline	No problem :) Go forth and have fun
2006-09-20T15:27:00.000Z	drumline	Empty	heh... will do.  Niter!
