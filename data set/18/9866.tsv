2012-07-05T16:25:00.000Z	ldiamond		Flash makes my music player "skip"... like this: "The space be-be-be-be-between...."
2012-07-05T16:25:00.000Z	ldiamond		This only happens when there's a website open w/ flash funning
2012-07-05T16:25:00.000Z	ldiamond		running*
2012-07-05T16:25:00.000Z	ldiamond		and I can also see the flash video freeze at the same time
2012-07-05T16:25:00.000Z	ldiamond		The music is coming from Rhythmbox.
2012-07-05T16:26:00.000Z	ldiamond		Adobe keeps finding new reasons for me to hate them.
2012-07-05T16:27:00.000Z	BluesKaj	ldiamond	have you tried any other players , like VLC
2012-07-05T16:28:00.000Z	ldiamond	BluesKaj	nope
2012-07-05T16:29:00.000Z	BluesKaj	ldiamond	perhaps you should
2012-07-05T16:31:00.000Z	ldiamond	BluesKaj	Flash would be making my audio driver freeze?
2012-07-05T16:32:00.000Z	ldiamond	BluesKaj	Does it with VLC as well
2012-07-05T16:36:00.000Z	ldiamond	BluesKaj	it plays flv files in the browser
2012-07-05T16:37:00.000Z	BluesKaj	ldiamond	download a youtube file , and play it with VLC c
2012-07-05T16:38:00.000Z	ldiamond	BluesKaj	what are you trying to learn from that?
2012-07-05T16:40:00.000Z	BluesKaj	ldiamond	to isolate the problem , whether flash plays ok without a browser
2012-07-05T16:41:00.000Z	ldiamond	BluesKaj	well, it's definitely not the file itself. Does VLC use Adobe's decoders to play .flvs?
2012-07-05T16:42:00.000Z	BluesKaj	ldiamond	I think vlc uses it's own flash yes
2012-07-05T16:51:00.000Z	BluesKaj	ldiamond	the best place to place the libflashplyer.so file is in /usr/lib/mozilla/plugins , in my experirnce
