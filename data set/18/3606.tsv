2009-09-07T01:53:00.000Z	lightpriest__		question is, how do i know which kernel would work :D
2009-09-07T01:55:00.000Z	mneptok	lightpriest__	have you tried disabling Pulseaudio with the newer kernel?
2009-09-07T01:56:00.000Z	lightpriest__	mneptok	nope
2009-09-07T01:56:00.000Z	lightpriest__	mneptok	i'll try the older kernel first...
2009-09-07T01:56:00.000Z	mneptok	lightpriest__	are you booted to that kernel now?
2009-09-07T01:56:00.000Z	lightpriest__	mneptok	no it's the mediacenter. it's booting up now :)
2009-09-07T01:56:00.000Z	mneptok	lightpriest__	(the newer one with non-functioning audio, that is)
2009-09-07T01:57:00.000Z	lightpriest__	mneptok	the older one. the one that's left after the upgrade is now loading i'm checking ;p
2009-09-07T01:57:00.000Z	lightpriest__	mneptok	bahh the older kernel isn't working also
2009-09-07T01:58:00.000Z	lightpriest__	mneptok	i guess it's not a kernel issue
2009-09-07T01:58:00.000Z	lightpriest__		but some other package that was installed
2009-09-07T01:59:00.000Z	mneptok	lightpriest__	"killall pulseaudio" (no quotes)
2009-09-07T02:00:00.000Z	lightpriest__	mneptok	nothing.
2009-09-07T02:00:00.000Z	lightpriest__	mneptok	isn't pulseaudio "above" alsa?
2009-09-07T02:00:00.000Z	mneptok	lightpriest__	it is
2009-09-07T02:01:00.000Z	lightpriest__	mneptok	my problem is that i can't change the volume of the master channel and everything else. it's stuck on zero...
2009-09-07T02:01:00.000Z	lightpriest__		i'll take a screenshot
