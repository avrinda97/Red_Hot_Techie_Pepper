2010-04-01T15:28:00.000Z	gosh		hello! I installed Ubuntu 9.10 recently, but the XServer doesn't seem to work. It says "/dev/fb0: no such file or directory". The LiveCD worked perfectly though, and I've been using Ubuntu Hardy for years without any problems. What can I do?
2010-04-01T15:28:00.000Z	moetunes	gosh	read the Xorg log in /var/log
2010-04-01T15:29:00.000Z	moetunes	gosh	look for lines that start with EE
2010-04-01T15:29:00.000Z	gosh	moetunes	yes, it says (EE) /dev/fb0: no such file or directory
2010-04-01T15:30:00.000Z	moetunes	gosh	should be an error above that
2010-04-01T15:30:00.000Z	gosh	moetunes	okay, i'll look at the file and return then. Thanks!
