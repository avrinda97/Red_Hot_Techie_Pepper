2005-09-25T08:32:00.000Z	DjKritical	cafuego	They work fine for me.. but every couple of reboots they hang on the glx module
2005-09-25T08:33:00.000Z	DjKritical	cafuego	oh really? then why isn't jessids computer working?
2005-09-25T08:33:00.000Z	DjKritical	cafuego	have you experienced the same problem as him? no? then stfu
2005-09-25T08:34:00.000Z	DjKritical	cafuego	the packaged nvidia drivers ARE OLD
2005-09-25T08:37:00.000Z	DjKritical	cafuego	I can almost garuntee it will fix his problem, because I had the exact same problem.. and it took me like a week with the help of people in this channel to figure it out
2005-09-25T08:38:00.000Z	DjKritical	cafuego	backporting a driver?... "waves his hand over his head"
2005-09-25T08:39:00.000Z	DjKritical	cafuego	like you said before... whats the point in getting someone to do something complicated like that when nvidias website has simple instructions on how to install the newest drivers with one command that will fix the problem?...
2005-09-25T08:39:00.000Z	DjKritical	cafuego	simple solution for a simple problem...
2005-09-25T08:41:00.000Z	DjKritical	cafuego	are you trying to say that the newest nvidia drivers are going to scerw his system... both you and I know that's a fallacy
2005-09-25T08:44:00.000Z	DjKritical	cafuego	I see your point yes, but however your solution of installing backported drivers isn't even proven to work.  You're saying my solution is flawed, I'm challenging that your solution wouldn't even work.
2005-09-25T08:44:00.000Z	DjKritical	cafuego	also if he were wanting to upgrade his drivers in the future the easiest option is to get them straight from nvidia instead of waiting weeks for the repositories to be updated
2005-09-25T08:46:00.000Z	DjKritical	cafuego	how abot you go hold his hand through it and prove me wrong :P
2005-11-07T17:24:00.000Z	cafuego	DjKritical	Undoubtedly via an umask directive.
2005-11-07T17:24:00.000Z	DjKritical	cafuego	local_umask perhaps?
2005-11-07T16:52:00.000Z	cafuego	DjKritical	5901 isn't dynamic ;-)
2005-11-07T16:52:00.000Z	DjKritical	cafuego	what?
2005-11-07T16:52:00.000Z	DjKritical	cafuego	I just mean that I can't map port 5900 to port 5901 on the router
2005-11-07T16:53:00.000Z	cafuego	DjKritical	d'oh!
