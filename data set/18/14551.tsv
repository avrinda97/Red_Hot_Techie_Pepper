2008-04-27T22:26:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	redheat	have you not seen the messages from the bot? ASK your question
2008-04-27T22:27:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	redheat	1500+ users == a busy channel, repeat your question every five minutes or so if it doesn't get attention
2008-04-27T22:29:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	redheat	be concise and stick to ONE line, have you noticed the lines are flying by? tough to pay attention to 7 or 8 lines that are scattered
2008-04-27T22:31:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	redheat	I'm using Wep here, works fine for me
2008-04-27T22:32:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	redheat	developers have made wi-fi easier in the latest versions- double check everything
2008-04-27T22:33:00.000Z	CaptainMorgan	redheat	I've tested wpa as well and it works for me here
