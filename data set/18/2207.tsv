2010-07-31T01:01:00.000Z	milen8204		Anyone knows How I can connect to Micro SD to my Sony Ericsson K 750i whit USB cable?
2010-07-31T01:01:00.000Z	ikonia	milen8204	I strongly doubt that will work
2010-07-31T01:02:00.000Z	milen8204	ikonia	thanks you have solved my problem many thanks dude
2010-07-31T01:02:00.000Z	ikonia	milen8204	sorry it's not good news, but I'm pretty confident that won't work
2010-07-31T01:03:00.000Z	ikonia	milen8204	because the sony software is propriatary and not designed to use your laptops hardware as a drive
2010-07-31T01:04:00.000Z	ikonia	milen8204	please control your language, it's uncalled for
2010-07-31T01:04:00.000Z	ikonia	milen8204	that is not censoring, - don't use that language again please.
2010-07-31T01:05:00.000Z	milen8204	ikonia	no problem ...
2011-08-11T21:09:00.000Z	ikonia	milen8204	I didn't think rosseta strone was available on linux
2011-08-11T21:12:00.000Z	milen8204	ikonia	Yes it is :D
2011-08-11T21:12:00.000Z	ikonia	milen8204	not on the website it's not, there is no linux version
2011-08-11T21:13:00.000Z	milen8204	ikonia	there is a wine :D
2011-08-11T21:13:00.000Z	ikonia	milen8204	wine is not linux
2011-08-11T21:13:00.000Z	ikonia	milen8204	wine will complicate a lot of things
2011-08-11T21:14:00.000Z	milen8204	ikonia	yes I know it is linux app
2011-08-11T21:14:00.000Z	ikonia	milen8204	also check out #winehq as a support channel
2011-08-11T21:14:00.000Z	ikonia	milen8204	try not to misslead people, rosettastone is not a linux app - you're trying to use a windows application under wine
2011-08-11T21:17:00.000Z	milen8204	ikonia	ok ok whatever, thanks for the help
