2009-06-21T04:58:00.000Z	dva5912		guys i just installed ubuntu, just to realize that as far as i know their is no support for my cannon pixma MP480. Has this changed or do i have to go back to 'shutters' vista?
2009-06-21T04:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dva5912	 check cups.org for printer status
2009-06-21T04:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dva5912	 my canon printer only recently got supported.
2009-06-21T04:59:00.000Z	dva5912	Dr_Willis	looks like no support. no drivers found.. ;( I dont want to go back :(((
2009-06-21T05:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dva5912	 they used to have 'paid comercial' drivers at one time. Personally i WONT be buying another canon printer any time soon.
2009-06-21T05:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dva5912	 i doubt it.
2009-06-21T05:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dva5912	 canon is bad about givbing out info on their printers to the public
2009-06-21T05:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dva5912	 dont hold your breath...
2009-06-21T05:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dva5912	 :)
2009-06-21T05:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dva5912	 it might be able to use drivers for a similer printer. check th forums perhaps?
2009-06-21T05:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dva5912	 i found windoss 7 lacking in a great many printer drivers also.
2009-06-21T05:44:00.000Z	dva5912	Dr_Willis	Well i ran mine no problem
2009-06-21T05:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dva5912	 aparently my 'plc5' standard laser printer isent imporntant enough to bother to include drivers any more.
2009-06-21T05:46:00.000Z	dva5912	Dr_Willis	so you got a verry pricy laser that dont work?
2009-06-21T05:46:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dva5912	 just the opposite.. :) a 14 yr old Workhorse.. that keeps chugging along..   drivers have been included  in windows for it for 14 years
2009-06-21T05:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dva5912	 sane is for scanners....
2009-06-21T05:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dva5912	 picture a scanner and printer both plugged into a usb hub. :)
2009-06-21T05:58:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	dva5912	 i did have a neat printer/scanner that worked like a photocopier. :)
