2005-06-18T14:15:00.000Z	Kano_Ubuntu		hi, did someone else have systemlocks with 2.6.11-k7 kernel?
2005-06-18T14:15:00.000Z	Kano_Ubuntu		with installed nvidia 7664 it locks up when gnome is starting
2005-06-18T14:16:00.000Z	Kano_Ubuntu		i know that 2.6.11 can run fine....
2005-06-18T14:17:00.000Z	Kano_Ubuntu		have it running usually
2005-06-18T14:17:00.000Z	Kano_Ubuntu		someone should enable /proc/config.gz kernel option
2005-06-18T14:18:00.000Z	Kano_Ubuntu		and disable IO_APIC
2005-06-18T14:18:00.000Z	crimsun	Kano_Ubuntu	why? Don't you have a /boot/config-$(uname -r)?
2005-06-18T14:18:00.000Z	Kano_Ubuntu	crimsun	yes, but that other way is better
2005-06-18T14:19:00.000Z	crimsun	Kano_Ubuntu	because it's in ram instead of on secondary storage?
2005-06-18T14:20:00.000Z	Kano_Ubuntu	crimsun	because it is quite common that way.
2005-06-18T14:20:00.000Z	crimsun	Kano_Ubuntu	file a bug against linux then.
2005-06-18T14:21:00.000Z	crimsun	Kano_Ubuntu	bugzilla.u.c
2005-06-18T14:21:00.000Z	Kano_Ubuntu	crimsun	i wont use ubuntu for long time, i just adopted my nvidia script for it
2005-06-18T14:22:00.000Z	crimsun	Kano_Ubuntu	that's fine, I know you have your own distro
2005-06-18T14:22:00.000Z	Kano_Ubuntu	crimsun	just wanted to tell you some things to improve, i dont file bug reports for u.
2005-06-18T14:22:00.000Z	crimsun	Kano_Ubuntu	but if you want to actually contribute and hopefully make a change, then file a bug.
2005-06-18T14:23:00.000Z	crimsun	Kano_Ubuntu	don't whine uselessly. Be proactive.
2005-06-18T14:23:00.000Z	Kano_Ubuntu	crimsun	if i wanted to use it, i would instlal my own kernel
