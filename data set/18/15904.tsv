2006-07-25T06:22:00.000Z	rr		anyone know of fedora directory server .deb packages ?
2006-07-25T06:22:00.000Z	ajmitch	rr	no, it's very near impossible to build properly & package
2006-07-25T06:23:00.000Z	ajmitch	rr	well, impossible to do without sitting down for quite awhile & fixing a number of issues
2006-07-25T06:24:00.000Z	rr	ajmitch	: what issues ur havin ?
2006-07-25T06:24:00.000Z	ajmitch	rr	the fact that it wants specific version of many libraries, and you have to compile half the known world to get that
2006-07-25T06:25:00.000Z	rr	ajmitch	: bummer, so ur almost forced to use FC/redhat to use FDS ?
2006-07-25T06:25:00.000Z	ajmitch	rr	at the moment, yes
2006-07-25T06:26:00.000Z	ajmitch	rr	if I have a lot more spare time I'll look at packaging FDS
2006-07-25T06:26:00.000Z	rr	ajmitch	: was it iplanet before ?
