2010-09-11T02:00:00.000Z	quidnunc		Where are iptables rules usually source on startup? I have some rules loading somewhere but I forgot how to edit them
2010-09-11T02:01:00.000Z	quidnunc		!pm
2010-09-11T02:01:00.000Z	jrib	quidnunc	probably from ufw or firestarter (sorry I have to go)
2010-09-11T02:01:00.000Z	quidnunc	jrib	No, I didn't it manually
2010-09-11T03:31:00.000Z	jrib	quidnunc	no where.
2010-09-11T03:31:00.000Z	quidnunc	jrib	Pardon?
2010-09-11T03:32:00.000Z	jrib	quidnunc	iptables are not stored anywhere by default
2010-09-11T03:32:00.000Z	quidnunc	jrib	Yes but I stored them somehow to be loaded at boot. I can't remember where. What are the standard methods of loading iptables rules?
2010-09-11T03:33:00.000Z	jrib	quidnunc	now, if you used ufw or firestarter, they'll start by default.  And there's a handful of ways you could have decided to store them.  If you read ubottu's documentation on iptables' then maybe rereading it will jog your memory
2010-09-11T03:33:00.000Z	quidnunc	jrib	No I used the command line.
2010-09-11T03:34:00.000Z	jrib	quidnunc	great, that means you didn't use firestart.  That still means you could have used ufw or followed ubottu's instructions on iptables
2012-10-26T23:40:00.000Z	jrib	quidnunc	try « sudo apt-get clean » to get some space
2012-10-26T23:40:00.000Z	quidnunc	jrib	I can't sudo
2012-10-26T23:40:00.000Z	jrib	quidnunc	use recovery mode
2012-10-26T23:40:00.000Z	quidnunc	jrib	:(
2012-10-26T23:40:00.000Z	jrib	quidnunc	?
2012-10-26T23:41:00.000Z	quidnunc	jrib	Shouldn't be necessary to reboot machine
2012-10-26T23:41:00.000Z	jrib	quidnunc	well delete things that you have access then
