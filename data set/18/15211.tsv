2005-04-27T10:59:00.000Z	kanuha		anyone know how to get quake3 to work with sound?
2005-04-27T11:00:00.000Z	yfir	kanuha	try turning off esd
2005-04-27T11:01:00.000Z	yfir	kanuha	type 'ps aux | grep esd' and then kill anything listed
2005-04-27T11:04:00.000Z	yfir	kanuha	try again. open a terminal, type 'ps aux | grep esd' then post the result in #flood
2005-04-27T11:07:00.000Z	kanuha	yfir	I posted it in #flood
2005-04-27T11:07:00.000Z	yfir	kanuha	yes, same as before. not sure i understand the output though
2005-04-27T11:08:00.000Z	yfir	kanuha	haha, looks like esd isnt' even running
2005-04-27T11:09:00.000Z	yfir	kanuha	sorry, doesn't help you play quake. but often sound problems are due to esd.
2005-04-27T11:09:00.000Z	kanuha	yfir	I also tried the other idea in the faq, quake3 +set s_initsound 0
2005-04-27T11:10:00.000Z	yfir	kanuha	ok. sorry, i don't know anything about playing quake itself. you''ll have to ask someone else about that
2005-04-27T11:10:00.000Z	kanuha	yfir	let me post the error I get about sound when I start Quake3 and see if that helps.
2005-04-27T11:11:00.000Z	yfir	kanuha	ok, worth a shot
2005-04-27T11:12:00.000Z	kanuha	yfir	it is in #flood
2005-04-27T11:16:00.000Z	yfir	kanuha	not sure. try making sure you are part of the 'audio' group. looks like quake is running into permission problems
2005-04-27T11:16:00.000Z	yfir	kanuha	not sure exactly what's happening though
2005-04-27T11:17:00.000Z	yfir	kanuha	but i guess, if you have other sounds you already are audio group...
2005-04-27T11:19:00.000Z	kanuha	yfir	I googled on the error that I got and I am reading up on a fix action. Hope it works, Thanks for your help.
2005-04-27T11:19:00.000Z	yfir	kanuha	or lack of help :) hope you figure it out
