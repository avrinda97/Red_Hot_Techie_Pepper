2009-06-25T20:40:00.000Z	mdm	ehazlett	its a program used to define a process that has a file or socket open and then act accodingly.  There is a reason the posix switches are f, u, c and k
2009-06-25T20:40:00.000Z	ehazlett	mdm	yeah, i know what it is -- i was just having trouble with it
2009-06-25T20:41:00.000Z	mdm	ehazlett	if you do that on a directory it will look to see what processes it is associated with, ie what has it open, since you told it k, it will send kill signals to each of those processes
2009-06-25T20:42:00.000Z	mdm	ehazlett	that included you, your shell so when you do it on a directory your shell has open, you kill your own shell
2009-06-25T20:44:00.000Z	ehazlett	mdm	i thought that if you used the "-m" switch, it only killed processes that have opened files in that directory
2009-06-25T20:45:00.000Z	mdm	ehazlett	-m means mounted, you give it a name and anything that is using that directory and everything under that directory
2009-06-25T20:46:00.000Z	mdm	ehazlett	keep in mind fuser is not a command to be used lightly and misused can cause great damnage
2009-06-25T20:46:00.000Z	ehazlett	mdm	so, if i am in my home, directory and run 'fuser -km /opt/temp'  it should only kill what has opened files in /opt/temp fight
2009-06-25T20:47:00.000Z	mdm	ehazlett	and what is under it
2009-06-25T20:47:00.000Z	ehazlett	mdm	right, so why is it crashing my gnome-session?
2009-06-25T20:47:00.000Z	mdm	ehazlett	not just files, also any sockets, any directory, any log, any output
2009-06-25T20:48:00.000Z	mdm	ehazlett	did you happen to be in the directory?
2009-06-25T20:48:00.000Z	ehazlett	mdm	yeah, there's only 1 process in that directory if i use fuser <path>
2009-06-25T20:48:00.000Z	ehazlett	mdm	no, i'm not in it
2009-06-25T20:49:00.000Z	mdm	ehazlett	its also posible it was talking to gnome, and fuser faithfully followed the path to gnome and killed it.  Fuser is not exactly an elegant program
2009-06-25T20:49:00.000Z	mdm	ehazlett	ESPECAILLY since fuser is a posix compliance program and linux is not fully compliant
2009-06-25T20:49:00.000Z	ehazlett	mdm	gotcha
2009-06-25T20:49:00.000Z	ehazlett	mdm	thx
