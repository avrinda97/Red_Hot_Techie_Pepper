2006-06-06T08:19:00.000Z	Keigo-kun		Is there any good program like mIRC for Ubuntu? I tried to compile xchat, but it just won't work, no matter how many packages I download
2006-06-06T08:20:00.000Z	ndazza	Keigo-kun	xchat is installed by default (i think). try just typing xchat from a console
2006-06-06T08:20:00.000Z	Keigo-kun		Because there isn't any xchat package for ubuntu on their site :(
2006-06-06T08:20:00.000Z	ndazza	Keigo-kun	try using synaptic package manager
2006-06-06T08:21:00.000Z	Keigo-kun		I have uni enabled
2006-06-06T08:21:00.000Z	Keigo-kun		Anyway, I want to be able to compile programs anyway.. I thought Ubuntu came with the nessecary tools..
2006-06-06T08:21:00.000Z	ndazza		xchat is in main
2006-06-06T08:21:00.000Z	Keigo-kun		but even after installing make, glibc-dev and build-essential, it won't work
2006-06-06T08:21:00.000Z	ndazza		see 'apt-cache policy xchat'
2006-06-06T08:22:00.000Z	Keigo-kun		It say it can't find -lperl in some folder
2006-06-06T08:22:00.000Z	Keigo-kun		I allready have build-essential
2006-06-06T08:22:00.000Z	Keigo-kun		it's not enough
2006-06-06T08:22:00.000Z	Keigo-kun		everything up to make works
2006-06-06T08:23:00.000Z	Keigo-kun		I didn't know xchat was allready supplied, I looked for it in the synaptic thing
2006-06-06T08:23:00.000Z	ndazza	Keigo-kun	sudo apt-get install libperl-dev
2006-06-06T08:23:00.000Z	Keigo-kun	ndazza	I'll try that
2006-06-06T08:23:00.000Z	Keigo-kun		brb, hopefully >_>
2006-06-06T08:23:00.000Z	ndazza	Keigo-kun	it's definately available through synaptic in breezy
