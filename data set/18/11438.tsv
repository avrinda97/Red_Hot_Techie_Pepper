2006-07-28T09:34:00.000Z	DJAdmiral		is it just me or is anybody else's updates downloading really, really slow?
2006-07-28T09:35:00.000Z	DJAdmiral		is anybody else's download speed for updates going dead slow?
2006-07-28T09:36:00.000Z	longwave	DJAdmiral	yes, security.ubuntu.com is going very slow at the moment for some reason
2006-07-28T09:36:00.000Z	longwave	DJAdmiral	i would hope so, they are usually fast
2006-07-28T09:43:00.000Z	longwave	DJAdmiral	take a look at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LaptopTestingTeam and fill in an installation report, maybe?
2006-07-28T09:43:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	longwave	Thanks again, i'll go fill up something now
2006-07-31T16:10:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	longwave	wouldn't it be more safer to use the alternate iso instead?
2006-07-31T16:23:00.000Z	longwave	DJAdmiral	i use ddclient to update my dyndns.org address, it's worked for me for years :)
2006-08-03T08:31:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	longwave	nice, thanks for the tip
2006-08-03T08:32:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	longwave	how do you try another country's archive server?
2006-08-03T08:33:00.000Z	longwave	DJAdmiral	edit /etc/apt/sources.list, you will have something like us.archive.ubuntu.com which is the US server, you can change that to de for the German server, nl for the Dutch server, etc.
2006-08-03T08:33:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	longwave	mine is ae, thanks
2006-08-03T09:04:00.000Z	longwave	DJAdmiral	you don't even need an ftp server, openssh provides sftp anyway
2006-08-03T09:04:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	longwave	thanks, i learned something today!
2006-08-03T09:08:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	longwave	XAMPP is easier and faster :P
2006-08-03T09:09:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	longwave	plus it has the calendar thing that verus_ wants.
2006-08-03T09:09:00.000Z	longwave	DJAdmiral	but upgrading it later is more difficult because you are not using ubuntu packaging
2006-08-03T09:09:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	longwave	yay for XAMPP! lol
