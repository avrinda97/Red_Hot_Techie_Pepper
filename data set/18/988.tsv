2011-08-11T00:07:00.000Z	zykotick9	kingofswords	see http://www.webupd8.org/2010/02/pulseaudio-system-wide-equalizer-now.html

2011-08-22T05:01:00.000Z	zykotick9	kingofswords	depends on the game but check in the ~/.wine directory somewhere
2011-08-22T05:01:00.000Z	kingofswords	zykotick9	yeh i know ...im having trouble locating 'my documents' in wine..thats where gamessaves are normally
2011-08-25T05:36:00.000Z	zykotick9	kingofswords	i sure hope this game ends up being worth all the effort
2011-08-25T05:41:00.000Z	zykotick9	kingofswords	i doubt upgrading xorg in lucid will be trivial
2011-08-25T05:44:00.000Z	zykotick9	kingofswords	i wouldn't "personally" recommend that anyone upgrade ubuntu - be SURE to have backups of any important files!
2011-08-25T05:46:00.000Z	kingofswords	zykotick9	why is there the option in update manager if its so dodgy to upgrade(ive read this lots of other places too)?
2011-08-25T05:46:00.000Z	zykotick9	kingofswords	oh lots of people do it (even without issues), but many run into problems
2011-08-25T05:48:00.000Z	kingofswords	zykotick9	 milamber  thx for all help
2011-10-01T23:15:00.000Z	zykotick9	kingofswords	in VLC: tool / preferences - audio, is Pulse selected for the output?
2011-10-01T23:21:00.000Z	kingofswords	zykotick9	no oss or asla is selected
2011-10-01T23:21:00.000Z	zykotick9	kingofswords	alsa doesn'
2011-10-01T23:23:00.000Z	kingofswords	zykotick9	pulse unsyncs audio when i watch videos
2011-10-01T23:24:00.000Z	zykotick9	kingofswords	with vlc?  that's surprising to me, i've run into that issue with mplayer sometimes, and have to use vlc.  sorry i don't have any suggestions for ya - good luck.
