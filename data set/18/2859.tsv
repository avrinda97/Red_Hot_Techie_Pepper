2010-02-04T21:08:00.000Z	dbear		hello all.. I am hoping I can get suggestions on getting my dual display with nvidia quadro working on ubuntu 9.10.
2010-02-04T21:08:00.000Z	k0d3g3ar	dbear	 I just finished setting up my dual display.  What ya need?
2010-02-04T21:09:00.000Z	dbear	k0d3g3ar	when using the nividia settings tools when I go to save, I get the error that it can't parse xorg.conf
2010-02-04T21:10:00.000Z	k0d3g3ar	dbear	 Yep, that's a bug in that tool set.  Use the 'Preview' option to see the xorg.conf changes it wants to make and then manually copy that code into your xorg.conf outside of their software
2010-02-04T21:11:00.000Z	k0d3g3ar	dbear	 But what I can tell you is that its worth studying how xorg.conf works because you will probably want to tweak it manually.  Don't rely entirely on nvidia-settings for complex setups
2010-02-04T21:11:00.000Z	dbear	k0d3g3ar	... ah.. will try that.
2010-02-04T21:11:00.000Z	k0d3g3ar	dbear	 what I'm doing is trying to get a custom xorg.conf to change based on different grub2 menu selections.  One for my laptop when I'm traveling and one for my desktop config when I get back in.
2010-02-04T21:12:00.000Z	k0d3g3ar	dbear	 one other thing...  You might want to try and make sure that all of your monitors share common display resolution because if you don't its a bit weird trying to make twinview look good
2010-02-04T21:14:00.000Z	dbear	k0d3g3ar	how do I preview the settings the nvidia tools wants to make .. I don't see a preview button.
2010-02-04T21:15:00.000Z	k0d3g3ar	dbear	if you hit 'apply' it should automatically set it up the way you want it
2010-02-04T21:16:00.000Z	dbear	k0d3g3ar	when I do 'apply,' I get a dialog, cannot apply, the current settings cannot be completedly applied du to one or more of the following reasons:... a restart of the xserver is required
2010-02-04T21:17:00.000Z	k0d3g3ar	dbear	 Are you using X Server settings, or Twinview?
2010-02-04T21:17:00.000Z	k0d3g3ar	dbear	 ie have multiple seperate X-Windows running in parallel?
2010-02-04T21:19:00.000Z	dbear	k0d3g3ar	selected separate X screen option in the nvidia control panel
2010-02-04T21:19:00.000Z	dbear	k0d3g3ar	the first display works find
2010-02-04T21:19:00.000Z	k0d3g3ar	dbear	 oh, ok.  I don't have mine setup that way.  I have one big extended desktop
2010-02-04T21:20:00.000Z	k0d3g3ar	dbear	 I need to be able drag & drop windows between displays
2010-02-04T21:20:00.000Z	k0d3g3ar	dbear	 you can't do that with separate X sessions
