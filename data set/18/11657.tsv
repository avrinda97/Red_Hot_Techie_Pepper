2006-06-28T05:49:00.000Z	Slaryn		And a whole lot of these

2006-06-28T05:49:00.000Z	Slaryn		Dunno what they mean though.
2006-06-28T05:50:00.000Z	Slaryn		Yes
2006-06-28T05:50:00.000Z	Slaryn		I can't access google.com, or a few other sites.  And as I said, no AIM/MSN, only IRC.
2006-06-28T05:50:00.000Z	Slaryn		Might it have something to do with types of packets?
2006-06-28T05:51:00.000Z	Slaryn		Oh, no :p
2006-06-28T05:51:00.000Z	Slaryn		One moment
2006-06-28T05:52:00.000Z	Slaryn		No nothing comes up, CarlFX
2006-06-28T05:52:00.000Z	wildekek	Slaryn	: "a few other sites", does this mean a few sites *are* working? if so, it could it be your dns settings?
2006-06-28T05:52:00.000Z	Slaryn	wildekek	yes some sites do work
2006-06-28T05:52:00.000Z	Slaryn		And I don't know about my DNS settings :p
2006-06-28T05:53:00.000Z	Slaryn		It's on DHCP, I know that
2006-06-28T05:53:00.000Z	Slaryn		Static IP kills the whole thing
2006-06-28T05:53:00.000Z	Slaryn		Oh, sorry.  ;)
2006-06-28T05:54:00.000Z	wildekek	Slaryn	then you probably also get your dns trough dhcp...do other machines work on the same network trough dhcp?
2006-06-28T05:54:00.000Z	Slaryn	wildekek	I'm not sure, the only other machines on this network would be people in their hotel rooms.... and at 4:54am not really at liberty to ask them ;D
