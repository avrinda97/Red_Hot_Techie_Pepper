2012-10-28T18:08:00.000Z	alexaaaaaa		i'm using xubuntu 12.04
2012-10-28T18:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	alexaaaaaa	if you run:  sudo apt-get update     is it smooth?
2012-10-28T18:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	alexaaaaaa	and if you run:  sudo apt-get upgrade    is it smooth?
2012-10-28T18:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	alexaaaaaa	how do you mean 'admin account'?
2012-10-28T18:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	alexaaaaaa	technically, users in the 'sudo' group are admins, they need to be in that group to run admin commands
2012-10-28T18:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	alexaaaaaa	then it won't work as the standard account, it doesn't have permissions
2012-10-28T18:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	alexaaaaaa	also run:  gksudo software-center      what is output?
2012-10-28T18:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	alexaaaaaa	the update may help
2012-10-28T18:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	alexaaaaaa	gksudo gedit /usr/share/applications/software-center.desktop      change the Exec= line
2012-10-28T18:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	alexaaaaaa	sudo apt-get --reinstall install python2.7
2012-10-28T18:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	alexaaaaaa	reread what I said.....
2012-10-28T18:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	alexaaaaaa	I already told you, reread
2012-10-28T18:22:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	alexaaaaaa	reading is useful, you should try it
2012-10-28T18:37:00.000Z	alexaaaaaa	ActionParsnip	installed python
2012-10-28T18:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	alexaaaaaa	so you chaned the Exec line in /usr/share/applications/software-center.desktop   (or similar) to:  Exec=gksudo software-center     ?
2012-10-28T18:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	alexaaaaaa	the file is software-properties-gtk.desktop  too :)
