2010-07-29T10:33:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aaron_	no you need special softwares
2010-07-29T10:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aaron_	you can use unetbootin or usb-cretor-gtk   not sure about Win7 ISO though. I'd ask in ##windows about that

2012-11-19T16:02:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aaron_	and do you have a floppy disk?

2012-11-19T16:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aaron_	sounds like the USB is booting, just that there are features in puppy which maybe the CPU doesn't have. I'd ask in the puppy channel
