2011-05-28T08:36:00.000Z	econdudeawesome		Anyone know how to restore an MBR without a livecd?
2011-05-28T08:38:00.000Z	KM0201	econdudeawesome	u'd need either a live cd, or a live USB
2011-05-28T08:39:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	KM0201	That's the issue. I cannot seem to boot Ubuntu livecd's, and no idea why. But I can boot old Ubuntu-based distros (Rescatux)
2011-05-28T08:39:00.000Z	KM0201	econdudeawesome	are you sure you're not having some sort of hardware isssue?
2011-05-28T08:40:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	KM0201	It may be a hardware issue, but it booted Rescatux fine (but couldn't install GRUB2 tot he MBR)
2011-05-28T08:40:00.000Z	KM0201	econdudeawesome	dunno, somethin ain't right... can the machine boot USB.. and if so, do you have a usb drive at least 1gig?
2011-05-28T08:41:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	KM0201	machine can boot USB, set up to boot USB. Ubuntu starts to load from the liveCD (CD and USB tried) but then crashes
2011-05-28T08:41:00.000Z	KM0201	econdudeawesome	so it also crashes upon trying to boog the live USB?
2011-05-28T08:42:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	KM0201	downloaded from multiple sites to ensure I didn't have a bad cksum
2011-05-28T08:42:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	KM0201	and the live CD also
2011-05-28T08:42:00.000Z	KM0201	econdudeawesome	dunno, sounds like you got some kinda hardware issue going there.
2011-05-28T08:42:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	KM0201	Thanks, I'll work from that assumption. I'll try unplugging the video card and seeing if that works.
2011-05-28T08:43:00.000Z	KM0201	econdudeawesome	hmm, not sure why it would be the video card, but i guess it could be
2011-05-28T09:20:00.000Z	KM0201	econdudeawesome	well thats good news (what model video card?)
2011-05-28T09:21:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	KM0201	yes, you wer ehte one I wanted to thank
2011-05-28T09:21:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	KM0201	erm, nvidia GX410 or 420 I think...
2011-05-28T09:22:00.000Z	econdudeawesome	KM0201	really no idea why that happened. But it works now, so whoohoo :-)
2011-05-28T09:22:00.000Z	KM0201	econdudeawesome	well, u 2
