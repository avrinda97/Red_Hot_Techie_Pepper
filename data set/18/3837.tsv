2009-07-22T06:36:00.000Z	rambo298	Jcn	i don't see the 1250 in their list only the 1300
2009-07-22T06:40:00.000Z	rambo298	Jcn	what happens with your display?
2009-07-22T06:41:00.000Z	rambo298	Jcn	how did you install the ATI driver?
2009-07-22T06:41:00.000Z	rambo298	Jcn	did you install the driver?
2009-07-22T06:44:00.000Z	rambo298	Jcn	dude it's a shell script driven install; download the .run file, enter this command wherever you saved it "chmod 755 ati-driver-installer-9-3-x86.x86_64.run"; then enter "sh ./ati-driver-installer-9-3-x86.x86_64.run"
2009-07-22T06:45:00.000Z	rambo298	Jcn	video driver upgrades are never quick :)
2009-07-22T06:53:00.000Z	Jcn	rambo298	i got a ./default_policy.sh does not support version....etc
2009-07-22T06:55:00.000Z	rambo298	Jcn	and you've 9.04 installed?
2009-07-22T06:59:00.000Z	rambo298	Jcn	maybe this will help; one msg was about a bios setting http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=286527
2009-07-22T07:01:00.000Z	rambo298	Jcn	no, dealing with video drivers (and audio) is the tough part!  and windows has issues too!
