2008-04-28T21:24:00.000Z	ktne		i'm trying to install ubuntu using wubi
2008-04-28T21:25:00.000Z	ktne		but for some reason wubi crashes
2008-04-28T21:25:00.000Z	bazhang	ktne	busy box error?
2008-04-28T21:25:00.000Z	ktne	bazhang	wubi installed won't run
2008-04-28T21:25:00.000Z	ktne	bazhang	wubi installer won't run
2008-04-28T21:25:00.000Z	bazhang	ktne	you get busybox error or just a problem with the cd
2008-04-28T21:26:00.000Z	ktne	bazhang	the wubi installer crashes
2008-04-28T21:26:00.000Z	bazhang	ktne	check the iso vs md5sum
2008-04-28T21:26:00.000Z	ktne	bazhang	i have no iso
2008-04-28T21:26:00.000Z	ktne	bazhang	wubi is supposed to download ubuntu from the internet
2008-04-28T21:26:00.000Z	bazhang	ktne	how did you install then
2008-04-28T21:27:00.000Z	ktne	bazhang	wubi is a windows application
2008-04-28T21:27:00.000Z	bazhang	ktne	perhaps try again or consider unetbootin
2008-04-28T21:27:00.000Z	ktne	bazhang	that installs ubuntu n windows
2008-04-28T21:29:00.000Z	bazhang	ktne	please dont
2008-04-28T21:33:00.000Z	bazhang	ktne	the issue may be server related--they are still slow some places
