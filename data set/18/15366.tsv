2005-04-06T08:33:00.000Z	Dalkus		Does Warty ship with Gnome 1.2 or 2.x ?
2005-04-06T08:34:00.000Z	Dalkus		Thanks
2005-04-06T08:35:00.000Z	Dalkus		I'm having problems with the 'notification area' docking applet for Gnome (in warty). AMSN's icon *does* appear in it but double clicking dosnt minimise or hide AMSN, nothing happens. Any advice on how to fix this?
2005-04-06T08:36:00.000Z	Seveas	Dalkus	sounds like you need to change AMSN's configuration :)
2005-04-06T13:09:00.000Z	Seveas	Dalkus	sudo is much more secure than having people know the root password
2005-04-11T05:20:00.000Z	Seveas	Dalkus	why wait?
2005-04-11T05:21:00.000Z	Seveas	Dalkus	no
2005-04-11T05:54:00.000Z	Seveas	Dalkus	from ubuntu hoary universe
2005-04-11T05:55:00.000Z	Seveas	Dalkus	then use apt pinning
2005-04-11T05:55:00.000Z	Seveas	Dalkus	search the wiki, it's a way of defaulting to warty, but installing a few packages from hoary
2005-05-19T14:04:00.000Z	Seveas	Dalkus	you're right
2005-06-24T16:21:00.000Z	Dalkus	Seveas	it still helps

2005-07-16T10:10:00.000Z	Seveas	Dalkus	if you are in an experimental mood: http://ubuntu-nl.org/files/
2005-07-16T10:11:00.000Z	Dalkus	Seveas	no?
2005-07-16T10:12:00.000Z	Seveas	Dalkus	or it must have changed since I tried it :)
