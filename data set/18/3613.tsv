2010-01-02T13:29:00.000Z	yuanyelele		Hi! Is there a free version of mplayer for Ubuntu?
2010-01-02T13:29:00.000Z	lstarnes	yuanyelele	yes
2010-01-02T13:29:00.000Z	yuanyelele	lstarnes	Where can I find it?
2010-01-02T13:30:00.000Z	lstarnes	yuanyelele	look for it in the package manager
2010-01-02T13:31:00.000Z	yuanyelele	lstarnes	that one is in multiverse, I want a free version.
2010-01-02T13:31:00.000Z	lstarnes	yuanyelele	uhh
2010-01-02T13:31:00.000Z	lstarnes	yuanyelele	free as in price?
2010-01-02T13:31:00.000Z	yuanyelele	lstarnes	in freedom
2010-01-02T13:32:00.000Z	lstarnes	yuanyelele	I think it is free as in freedom, but there might be some code in it for patented codecs
2010-01-02T13:33:00.000Z	lstarnes	yuanyelele	in which case you can download the source code and edit out the bad parts
2010-01-02T13:33:00.000Z	lstarnes	yuanyelele	it is licensed under the GPL
2010-01-02T13:33:00.000Z	yuanyelele	lstarnes	I think ubuntu should make a free version because mplayer if so popular.
2010-01-02T13:33:00.000Z	lstarnes	yuanyelele	it is free
2010-01-02T13:34:00.000Z	lstarnes	yuanyelele	but it is included in multiverse due to the codecs that it uses being patented
2010-01-02T13:34:00.000Z	yuanyelele	lstarnes	I mean put the patented codecs in a separate package
2010-01-02T13:35:00.000Z	lstarnes	yuanyelele	I would recommend asking the MOTUs about that
2010-01-02T13:35:00.000Z	lstarnes	yuanyelele	see https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MOTU
2010-01-02T13:35:00.000Z	yuanyelele	lstarnes	Like gstreamer, -bad, -ugly, something like that.
