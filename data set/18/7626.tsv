2008-04-01T10:01:00.000Z	Positronic		Does anyone know the link to the website that automatically rebuilds your repositories?
2008-04-01T10:02:00.000Z	Flannel	Positronic	It's not up anymore, you can do the same thing via Software Sources
2008-04-01T10:02:00.000Z	Positronic	Flannel	any recommended Software sources?
2008-04-01T10:02:00.000Z	Flannel	Positronic	the official ones
2008-04-01T10:03:00.000Z	Positronic	Flannel	thanks
2008-04-01T10:04:00.000Z	Positronic	Flannel	how would I find a repository URL for XGL it appears the current one I have is no longer accessible?
2008-04-01T10:05:00.000Z	Flannel	Positronic	What version of Ubuntu are you running?
2008-04-01T10:05:00.000Z	Positronic	Flannel	7.10
2008-04-01T10:05:00.000Z	Flannel	Positronic	Gutsy already does that sort of stuff, you don't need third party repos for it
2008-04-01T10:06:00.000Z	Positronic	Flannel	when I installed 7.10 I needed to do it to get hardware acceleration to work, otherwise I had mesa
2008-04-01T10:07:00.000Z	Flannel	Positronic	That doesn't mean it's not in the repositories, just that it isn't enabled for everyone by default
2008-04-01T10:09:00.000Z	Positronic	Flannel	I guess what I am saying is I get an error when doing the update manager stating that the XGL repository might no longer be available as it was unable to download the index for it?
2008-04-01T10:09:00.000Z	Positronic	Flannel	you must forgive me as I am somewhat new to the linux environment as well
2008-04-01T10:10:00.000Z	Flannel	Positronic	Just remove it entirely, Ubuntu deprecates the need for third party repos for eyecandy
2008-04-01T10:11:00.000Z	Flannel	Positronic	er, newer versions, that is.
2008-04-01T10:12:00.000Z	Positronic	Flannel	was that recently an update for ubuntu within the last few months? So you dont have to install ATI drivers and set parameters for hardware acceleration manually anymore?
2008-04-01T10:13:00.000Z	Flannel	Positronic	ATI drivers don't give you XGL.  I have no idea with regards to the current driver situation,  https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI
2008-04-01T10:14:00.000Z	Positronic	Flannel	oh ok sorry I must have been confusing that with fglrx or something...
