2007-05-06T05:13:00.000Z	PurpZeY		How do I access the "Software channel" as described when I went to install a package "it's better if you install this through the software channel"?
2007-05-06T05:13:00.000Z	LjL	PurpZeY	never heard that term, where is it used?
2007-05-06T05:14:00.000Z	PurpZeY	LjL	I went to reinstall ubuntu-desktop, I downloaded the package and I got that message.
2007-05-06T05:14:00.000Z	LjL	PurpZeY	what do you mean when you say you "downloaded that package"? you went on the web and got the .deb file? that's certainly not the right method
2007-05-06T05:14:00.000Z	LjL	PurpZeY	if you want to reinstall ubuntu-desktop, you type "sudo apt-get --reinstall install ubuntu-desktop", or do the equivalent operation in Synaptic
2007-05-06T05:15:00.000Z	PurpZeY	LjL	Larger context...I was trying to upgrade to Pidgin...When I did apt-get remove gaim it took ubuntu-desktop with it...so now I need to reinstall that, and the nautilis in order to get back to where I was
2007-05-06T05:16:00.000Z	LjL	PurpZeY	nautilus is installed when you install ubuntu-desktop. anyway, just type the command i gave you (you can leave the "--reinstall" out)
2007-05-21T13:17:00.000Z	PurpZeY	LjL	So, is it better generally to install things using aptitude, so if you want to remove later it is easier?
2007-05-21T13:17:00.000Z	LjL	PurpZeY	not really, as that feature is now present (since Edgy) in all APT frontends, including apt-get
2007-05-21T13:18:00.000Z	PurpZeY	LjL	Got it, thanks.
2007-05-21T13:18:00.000Z	LjL	PurpZeY	aptitude is still a quite powerful program, though. google "aptitude manual", if you just look at the "search patterns" section, you'll see just how powerful it is
2007-05-23T15:41:00.000Z	LjL	PurpZeY	err...? "ls" is the command to list the contents of a directory. zabi asked about his hardware, "lshw" is a command that shows a lot of information about your computer's hardware. it's completely unrelated to "ls"
2007-05-23T15:42:00.000Z	PurpZeY	LjL	Got it .
2007-05-23T15:44:00.000Z	PurpZeY	LjL	Are modprobe -l and lshw very different? if so, what's the difference?
2007-06-03T14:21:00.000Z	LjL	PurpZeY	atselby: it means that the package was installed automatically (due to being a dependency of some other package) and can be automatically removed by invoking "apt-get autoremove" when it's no longer needed.
2007-06-03T14:21:00.000Z	PurpZeY	LjL	I was close...; )
2007-06-03T15:38:00.000Z	LjL	PurpZeY	the stuff you put in grep
2008-01-02T02:23:00.000Z	PurpZeY	LjL	Someone being a little testy about advice they were given. . .
