2009-05-09T15:32:00.000Z	PodeCoet		maybe I should run windows native, with linux under virtualbox - instead of the other way around :P
2009-05-09T15:32:00.000Z	Boohbah	PodeCoet	why?
2009-05-09T15:33:00.000Z	PodeCoet	Boohbah	Made the move from windows to linux 18 months ago, after 2 months of excessive pain everything works... Then my install completely breaks, so I reinstall, and there are HEAPS of tiny agravating issues that nobody seems to be able to help with
2009-05-09T15:35:00.000Z	Boohbah	PodeCoet	it used to be that way for me too. if you are willing to work through the issues you will learn lots of good things
2009-05-09T15:36:00.000Z	PodeCoet	Boohbah	I tried, ALOT... I dunno, I figured you know what, maybe if I dist-upgrade things will likely be fixed (in fact I was sure of it), but then I get slapped in the face with KDE4 :P
2009-05-09T15:37:00.000Z	Boohbah	PodeCoet	oooh... yes, i am still using kde 3.5.10 and hardy for that reason
2009-05-09T15:37:00.000Z	PodeCoet	Boohbah	same! KDE4 is terrible
2009-05-09T15:38:00.000Z	Boohbah	PodeCoet	err not hardy but intrepid. maybe you can try that
2009-05-09T15:40:00.000Z	PodeCoet	Boohbah	*cries* - Would a dist-upgrade get me to Intrepid without bursting into flame?
2009-05-09T15:40:00.000Z	PodeCoet	Boohbah	I should I do a complete reinstall?
2009-05-09T15:41:00.000Z	Boohbah	PodeCoet	probably a clean reinstall would work best
2009-05-09T15:45:00.000Z	Boohbah	PodeCoet	you can get a list of things you have installed and reinstall them
2009-05-09T15:45:00.000Z	PodeCoet	Boohbah	thats what I want!
2009-05-09T15:47:00.000Z	Boohbah	PodeCoet	 dpkg --get-selections > my_installed_packages.txt
2009-05-09T15:47:00.000Z	Boohbah	PodeCoet	sudo
2009-05-09T15:48:00.000Z	PodeCoet	Boohbah	w00t! thanks for that, downloading the interepid ISO now
2009-05-09T17:33:00.000Z	Boohbah	PodeCoet	you got your list of installed packages somewhere on home?
2009-05-09T17:33:00.000Z	PodeCoet	Boohbah	doh, nearly forgot :P
