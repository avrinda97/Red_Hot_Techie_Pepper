2011-02-01T09:09:00.000Z	justinsane_		please help! ubuntu is no longer picking up my sound card (soundblaster fatality)
2011-02-01T09:09:00.000Z	maco	justinsane_	if it worked in a previous release and not this one, i think you're in "file a bug" territory:  ubuntu-bug -s audio
2011-02-01T09:10:00.000Z	maco	justinsane_	though...you can try linux-backports-modules-alsa-maverick-generic
2011-02-01T09:10:00.000Z	maco	justinsane_	requires a reboot after install
2011-02-01T09:11:00.000Z	justinsane_		no
2011-02-01T09:11:00.000Z	justinsane_	maco	no, because it has worked in 10.10 before...
2011-02-01T09:11:00.000Z	justinsane_	maco	just recently stopped working...
2011-02-01T09:11:00.000Z	maco	justinsane_	well thats "ew" ... try booting an older kernel?
2011-02-01T09:11:00.000Z	justinsane_		maco; does it have something to do with pulseaudio?
2011-02-01T09:12:00.000Z	maco	justinsane_	pulseaudio runs on top of the drivers. if you have nothing in /proc/asound/cards, thats the driver or udev or something kernel-y screwing up
2011-02-01T09:12:00.000Z	justinsane_		Maco: i've never booted an older kernel...
2011-02-01T09:12:00.000Z	justinsane_		k
2011-02-01T09:12:00.000Z	maco	justinsane_	hold shift during boot and use arrow keys to pick the 3rd entry instead of the first
2011-02-01T09:12:00.000Z	justinsane_		k
2011-02-01T09:12:00.000Z	justinsane_		let me try that
2011-02-01T09:12:00.000Z	justinsane_	maco	any disclaimers?S
2011-02-01T09:12:00.000Z	maco	justinsane_	nope
