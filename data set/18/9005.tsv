2007-05-24T08:54:00.000Z	overdark		worked; now what do I do? :)
2007-05-24T08:55:00.000Z	overdark		note: i read that i have to type grub-install /dev/hda. i typed that with sudo and front and got: Could not find device for /boot: Not found or not a block device.
2007-05-24T08:56:00.000Z	stefg	overdark	try sda instead of hda
2007-05-24T08:58:00.000Z	stefg	overdark	?? so the drive is partitioned and ubuntu is installed?
2007-05-24T08:58:00.000Z	overdark	stefg	yes
2007-05-24T08:58:00.000Z	overdark	stefg	 both ubuntu and windows xp
2007-05-24T08:58:00.000Z	stefg	overdark	what does sudo fdisk -l tell you? (use pastebin)
2007-05-24T09:01:00.000Z	stefg	overdark	hmmm... does  'sudo update-grub' give any results?
2007-05-24T09:03:00.000Z	stefg	overdark	so if you is there a /boot/grub menu.lst in your install?
2007-05-24T09:03:00.000Z	stefg	overdark	so  is there a /boot/grub menu.lst in your install?
2007-05-24T09:03:00.000Z	stefg	overdark	then your install is seriously broken...
2007-05-24T09:04:00.000Z	overdark	stefg	what to do then?
2007-05-24T09:04:00.000Z	stefg	overdark	what did you do last?... if it's a fresh install, i'd suggest to do new install, this might be only the top of an iceberg
2007-05-24T09:05:00.000Z	overdark	stefg	I installed ubuntu yesterday, on a new partition (I mean, two new partitions, one for Linux itself and one for swap)
2007-05-24T09:06:00.000Z	stefg	overdark	something went wrong... reinstall
2007-05-24T09:06:00.000Z	overdark	stefg	reinstall ubuntu or windows?
2007-05-24T09:06:00.000Z	stefg	overdark	ubunbtu
2007-05-24T09:07:00.000Z	stefg	overdark	reinstall will take 30 min. troubleshooting 2 hrs.... a question of time economy
