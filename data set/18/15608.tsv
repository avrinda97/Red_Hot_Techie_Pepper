2006-05-27T05:48:00.000Z	northerntrekker		Can someone help me, I totally screwed up my system
2006-05-27T05:49:00.000Z	northerntrekker		I was messing with an install and I needed to give myself more permission to the USR directory. so I did sudo chmod 762 to it... and now I'm locked out of everything except the concole window
2006-05-27T05:49:00.000Z	northerntrekker		like the destop is gone
2006-05-27T05:50:00.000Z	northerntrekker		so I wanted to log in as the root
2006-05-27T05:50:00.000Z	northerntrekker		but dunno how
2006-05-27T05:50:00.000Z	northerntrekker		can anyone please help?
2006-05-27T05:51:00.000Z	northerntrekker		anyone at all
2006-05-27T05:52:00.000Z	ompaul	northerntrekker	this might help
2006-05-27T05:52:00.000Z	ompaul	northerntrekker	sudo chmod 755 /usr
2006-05-27T05:52:00.000Z	ompaul	northerntrekker	get a live cd boot the box mount the drive and do that
2006-05-27T05:54:00.000Z	ompaul	northerntrekker	not that I can think of given that you can't execute the commands
2006-05-27T05:55:00.000Z	ompaul	northerntrekker	and here is the down side - if you did that with a -R all bets are off
2006-05-27T05:55:00.000Z	ompaul	northerntrekker	now your thinking, do this
2006-05-27T05:55:00.000Z	ompaul	northerntrekker	did you do -R ?
2006-05-27T05:56:00.000Z	ompaul	northerntrekker	sudo is do as the superuser
2006-05-27T05:57:00.000Z	ompaul	northerntrekker	so as the machine boots gets to grub press esc and then choose recovery or rescue (can't remember) then >>mount -a <<and chown as I said already >> sudo chmod 755 /usr <<
2006-05-27T05:58:00.000Z	ompaul	northerntrekker	when you come back look at this link:  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RestrictedFormats it tells you how to install that software under Ubuntu
