2006-01-24T12:22:00.000Z	SuperLag		How do you boot the CD and disable framebuffer for the install process?
2006-01-24T12:22:00.000Z	SuperLag		the options listed on the CD aren't working, or I'm getting the syntax wrong :/
2006-01-24T12:23:00.000Z	mwe	SuperLag	the help (f1) tells you. sth with framebuffer=false
2006-01-24T12:24:00.000Z	SuperLag	mwe	do you pass that arg after 'linux' ?  i.e. linux framebuffer=false?
2006-01-24T12:24:00.000Z	mwe	SuperLag	I had to because the fb just gave me a black screen
2006-01-24T12:24:00.000Z	SuperLag	mwe	same here
2006-01-24T12:24:00.000Z	mwe	SuperLag	please read the help. I dont remember exactly
2006-01-24T12:24:00.000Z	mwe	SuperLag	just read the help it says how
2006-01-24T12:25:00.000Z	SuperLag	mwe	yeah, and it doesn't work
2006-01-24T12:25:00.000Z	mwe	SuperLag	well it did here. I think you must have done it wrong
2006-01-24T12:25:00.000Z	SuperLag	mwe	it days debian-installer/framebuffer=false
2006-01-24T12:25:00.000Z	mwe	SuperLag	yeah
2006-01-24T12:25:00.000Z	SuperLag	mwe	passing that line at boot: gives me an error
2006-01-24T12:25:00.000Z	mwe	SuperLag	don't you need a space there somewhere?
2006-01-24T12:26:00.000Z	mwe	SuperLag	you need linux before that
2006-01-24T12:26:00.000Z	mwe	SuperLag	linux debian-installer/framebuffer=false or sth
2006-01-24T12:32:00.000Z	SuperLag	mwe	linux debian-installer/framebuffer=false did the trick.  Thanks dude.
