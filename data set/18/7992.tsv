2007-10-16T12:35:00.000Z	mjbrooks		drew  I'm running KDE, but I believe your looking for the /etc/xdg/menus/applications.menu file which.. if I recall is an XML document that lists the menu structure in GNOME since 2.8 methinks
2007-10-16T12:36:00.000Z	drewbenn	mjbrooks	yes, that looks like it has the menus, great starting point, thanks!
2007-10-16T12:53:00.000Z	drewbenn	mjbrooks	- any file, I want it to open as if I navigated to the directory (slowly) with the 'file browser' and then double-clicked on it.  Is there something that will do that?
2007-10-16T12:53:00.000Z	mjbrooks	drewbenn	support for opening files from the CL is provided by the app itself
2007-10-16T12:54:00.000Z	mjbrooks	drewbenn	Assuming it's an executab;e file, just type the name of the app, but you may need the path as well
2007-10-16T12:55:00.000Z	mjbrooks	drewbenn	if it's a document, you may have to call the file as an argument to the program you want to open it with
2007-10-16T12:58:00.000Z	mjbrooks	drewbenn	it can, but it is more specific thatn just an open call
2007-10-16T13:07:00.000Z	mjbrooks	drewbenn	that's FUD bull... linux isn't harder than windows, you'd have just as much trouble on windows if the XP driver was broken for your wireless card
2007-10-16T13:07:00.000Z	drewbenn	mjbrooks	I agree.. there's just more usuers on windows, so "my driver is broken on windows" gets more attention, faster, than "my driver is broken on linux"....
2007-10-16T13:08:00.000Z	mjbrooks	drewbenn	that too is a crap argument.... there is much more community support for linux than there is for windows
2007-10-16T13:09:00.000Z	drewbenn	mjbrooks	I also agree - I'
2007-10-16T13:15:00.000Z	drewbenn	mjbrooks	that sure must make life interesting!
2007-10-16T13:31:00.000Z	mjbrooks	drewbenn	lol   that last one about being an engineer did  ;)
2007-10-16T13:48:00.000Z	drewbenn	mjbrooks	I agree, I want the official release today :(
2007-10-16T13:54:00.000Z	mjbrooks	drewbenn	I should grep my log cause I don't recall him talking before he spoke to me  lol
2007-10-16T13:54:00.000Z	mjbrooks	drewbenn	you mispelled your own name   lol
2007-10-16T13:58:00.000Z	mjbrooks	drewbenn	was going for the 2-4-1  ;)
2007-10-16T14:34:00.000Z	drewbenn	mjbrooks	lol
