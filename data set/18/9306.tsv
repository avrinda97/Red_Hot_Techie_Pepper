2009-12-06T13:26:00.000Z	merciless		Dr_Willis; the image of usb is created...what to do next?
2009-12-06T13:27:00.000Z	merciless		Dr_Willis; you mean mount -o??
2009-12-06T13:27:00.000Z	llutz	merciless	loop-mount will fail if your usb had partitions
2009-12-06T13:28:00.000Z	llutz	merciless	ok
2009-12-06T13:31:00.000Z	llutz	merciless	try without -t vfat
2009-12-06T13:35:00.000Z	llutz	merciless	should there be any data on that usb?
2009-12-06T13:35:00.000Z	llutz	merciless	it seems empty
2009-12-06T13:36:00.000Z	llutz	merciless	it doesn't contain a partition nor seems it to be superfloppy. maybe try gpart to recover
2009-12-06T13:38:00.000Z	llutz	merciless	gpart tries to recover partitions, not gpartED
2009-12-06T13:40:00.000Z	llutz	merciless	gksu synaptic
2009-12-06T13:42:00.000Z	llutz	merciless	something is broken, don't know what, sry
2009-12-06T14:07:00.000Z	llutz	merciless	?
2009-12-06T14:09:00.000Z	llutz	merciless	yes, looks like a superfloppy-format (entire device is used without partitions)
2009-12-06T14:09:00.000Z	llutz	merciless	but then your image should have been able to be mounted...
2009-12-06T14:13:00.000Z	llutz	merciless	my last idea is trying photorec to recover your data
2009-12-06T14:16:00.000Z	llutz	merciless	its in package testdisk
2009-12-06T14:17:00.000Z	llutz	merciless	/usr/sbin/photorec
2009-12-06T14:19:00.000Z	llutz	merciless	best read "man photorec"
