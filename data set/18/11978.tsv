2006-10-10T08:03:00.000Z	payo2000		hello
2006-10-10T08:04:00.000Z	payo2000		can anyone help me get my cd-rom to work?
2006-10-10T08:05:00.000Z	stefg	payo2000	what exactly isn't working?
2006-10-10T08:06:00.000Z	stefg	payo2000	can you paste the output of 'cat /etc/fstab' to http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/ please
2006-10-10T08:09:00.000Z	stefg	payo2000	 you get a link, please post it here
2006-10-10T08:11:00.000Z	stefg	payo2000	looks fine so far... what kind of drive controllers do you have? IDE, SCSI or SATA?
2006-10-10T08:14:00.000Z	stefg	payo2000	i think that, too :-) Have you verified that /media/cdrom0 is valid as mountpoint? You could paste 'lspci' and 'dmesg'-output, too tohttp://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/
2006-10-10T08:15:00.000Z	stefg	payo2000	but first tell me, if you get any error message if you type 'sudo mount /dev/scd0' in a terminal
2006-10-10T08:18:00.000Z	stefg	payo2000	please be exact!
2006-10-10T08:20:00.000Z	stefg	payo2000	ok, so you have a classical Adaptec SCSI-adapter according to your lspci...  is there a /dev/scd0 entry in /dev ?
2006-10-10T08:24:00.000Z	stefg	payo2000	I see... somehow your driver doesn't get loaded and the device-node isn't created. Paste the output of dmesg and lsmod to psatebin to let me check what doesn't get loaded
2006-10-10T08:31:00.000Z	stefg	payo2000	just type 'dmesg' to a terminal, and paste that output to http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/
2006-10-10T08:32:00.000Z	stefg	payo2000	it's dmesg
2006-10-10T08:39:00.000Z	stefg	payo2000	i got disconnected, have you pasted the output of 'lsmod' yet?
2006-10-10T08:42:00.000Z	stefg	payo2000	the good news is that everything looks like it should.... driver is there, but cdrom isn't seen at startup. The not so good news is that it might be a hardware-problem (your system is ooold ... :-) ) Have you checked all cable connections recently? can you boot a CD ?
2006-10-10T08:44:00.000Z	stefg	payo2000	hmmm... you have a breezy install CD, haven't you?
2006-10-10T08:45:00.000Z	stefg	payo2000	can you download a dapper Desktop-CD ?
2006-10-10T08:47:00.000Z	stefg	payo2000	it's a good idea to use Dapper anyway... i think you ran into a bug with the breezy kernel. It's fixable, but difficult for me to figure out what exactly is wrong... I last touched a SCSI system 5 years ago or so. I'd try to reinstall Dapper and see if the problem persists
