2007-07-21T15:52:00.000Z	mustang97		 Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: multiverse.server.engine.Engine
2007-07-21T15:52:00.000Z	mustang97		so on and so on..  I traced the error to a eror in the install of jdk
2007-07-21T15:52:00.000Z	NigelS	mustang97	if you just got it from apt -you wouldn't have to do any of this
2007-07-21T15:53:00.000Z	NigelS	mustang97	remove the one you got as an rpm, then apt-get install the jdk to change versions you use the update-alternatives --config java command
2007-07-21T15:53:00.000Z	NigelS	mustang97	that way you don't need to link to the binary
2007-07-22T16:01:00.000Z	NigelS	mustang97	that's a guide for CentOS
2007-07-22T16:02:00.000Z	NigelS	mustang97	in any event, is version 5 of the jdk not enough?
2007-07-22T16:04:00.000Z	NigelS	mustang97	sudo apt-get install sun-java5-jdk
2007-07-22T16:05:00.000Z	NigelS	mustang97	you keep contradicting yourself you say it's not instaled and then say you already have it..
2007-07-22T16:05:00.000Z	NigelS	mustang97	I have re-read the log of what you said
2007-07-22T16:06:00.000Z	NigelS	mustang97	YOU said you had it, not us.  update-alternatives --config java lets you choose the version you want to use
2007-07-22T16:06:00.000Z	NigelS	mustang97	and we TOLD YOU to stop it
2007-07-22T16:07:00.000Z	NigelS	mustang97	then give us the specific error for why they wont work
2007-07-22T16:10:00.000Z	NigelS	mustang97	you've currently got the gcj set to be your vm, you almost certainly don't want that - choose the sun java one that you want
2007-07-22T16:14:00.000Z	NigelS	mustang97	the jre is what you want, the jdk elements are still present of course
2007-07-22T16:14:00.000Z	NigelS	mustang97	you don't run java code with a special VM for having the JDK, the dev tools of the JDK are still there
2007-07-22T16:16:00.000Z	NigelS	mustang97	have you chosen the sun java option in update-alternatives yet?
