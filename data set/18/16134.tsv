2004-11-06T13:39:00.000Z	weswh-		and that's it.
2004-11-06T13:39:00.000Z	weswh-		now i'm in the vc - any advice?
2004-11-06T13:39:00.000Z	weswh-		ah...
2004-11-06T13:39:00.000Z	weswh-		nevermind. i've experience this problem before, ubuntu just made it farther than the other distros i have tried.
2004-11-06T13:40:00.000Z	weswh-		vc 2 gives the error readout i guess?
2004-11-06T13:42:00.000Z	weswh-		i keep having a problem on this machine (pII400, ide generic stuff)...where whenever i put in a bootable linux cd, it gets to 'start kernel', and then does a Kernel Panic, Fatal Exception in Interrupt. In Intterupt handler - not syncing
2004-11-06T13:43:00.000Z	weswh-		i've tried fedora, arch, and now ubuntoo - all the same result and error. common thread is the kernel...maybe this machine is having a problem booting 2.6?
2004-11-06T13:43:00.000Z	weswh-		or 2.6 just doesn't like my hardware? do i have any recourse to this?
2004-11-06T13:43:00.000Z	weswh-		or is the machine essentially just dead to any new linux distros?
2004-11-06T13:44:00.000Z	weswh-		piz - yeah, google...forums, etc. no luck.
2004-11-06T13:44:00.000Z	delire	weswh-	sounds a little serious with interrupts not syncing however.
2004-11-06T13:44:00.000Z	weswh-		right..
2004-11-06T13:44:00.000Z	weswh-		but, the machine runs win2k fine..
2004-11-06T13:44:00.000Z	weswh-		has for years.
2004-11-06T13:45:00.000Z	weswh-		so i can say that the hardware is fine. it's been a stable trustworthy box.
2004-11-06T13:45:00.000Z	weswh-		no i haven't - i will read the help on the ubuntu boot screen, try some of those
2004-11-06T13:45:00.000Z	delire	weswh-	i'd turn off funky features in the bios and try again/
2004-11-06T13:46:00.000Z	weswh-	delire	- yeah, i've changed the bios up several times...as of right now it's restored to factory defaults other than boot order. (no virus protection, etc.)
