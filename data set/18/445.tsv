2012-02-14T03:55:00.000Z	sweetie_		i have some DVD movies. what program do you recommend to copy them to my hard drive so that i can watch the movie without the disc? I want subtitle support and ease of copying
2012-02-14T03:55:00.000Z	sweetie_		thanks
2012-02-14T03:57:00.000Z	sweetie_		oehoeks
2012-02-14T03:57:00.000Z	sweetie_		ok
2012-02-14T03:58:00.000Z	sweetie_		which do i choose: make data project?  make video project? Disc copy? Burn image?
2012-02-14T04:00:00.000Z	meskarune	sweetie_	I would use handbreak to rip teh video to mkv (it has great subtitle support) iso files are huge so its better to rip to mkv or avi
2012-02-14T04:01:00.000Z	sweetie_	meskarune	but i want subtitle support AND all the extra scenes on the DVD
2012-02-14T04:01:00.000Z	meskarune	sweetie_	you can rip the extra scenes to avi files as well. and handbrake has support for adding subtitles. read a tutorial on handbrake. unless you have a million gigs of space to waste on your computer. :P
2012-02-14T04:01:00.000Z	sweetie_	meskarune	if i rip DVD, that means I just get the movie without the extras, right?
2012-02-14T04:02:00.000Z	sweetie_	meskarune	i have 71.7 GB free
2012-02-14T04:02:00.000Z	meskarune	sweetie_	no. you can rip all the video from the dvd to avi or mkv files and watch them. you won't have teh dvd menu though.
2012-02-14T04:02:00.000Z	meskarune	sweetie_	so you can rip all the extras you want.
2012-02-14T04:02:00.000Z	sweetie_		and I want to copy 20 DVDs for just a few days
2012-02-14T04:02:00.000Z	sweetie_	meskarune	will i have the subtitel support, though?
2012-02-14T04:02:00.000Z	meskarune	sweetie_	you NEED to rip to video files then. otherwise you'll use up all your disk space. one DVD = 8 GB
2012-02-14T04:03:00.000Z	meskarune	sweetie_	yeah, look up a handbreak tutorial to learn how to rip dvd's with subtitles to mkv formate
2012-02-14T04:03:00.000Z	meskarune	sweetie_	you will need dvd css drivers to rip dvd's with security on them
