2007-12-16T12:44:00.000Z	LordDicranius	Gnea	have u ever gotten that ctrl+sysreq+ combo to work?
2007-12-16T12:44:00.000Z	Gnea	LordDicranius	for *years*.
2007-12-16T12:44:00.000Z	Gnea	LordDicranius	but it's alt-sysrq
2007-12-16T12:44:00.000Z	LordDicranius	Gnea	err, yeah.  that's what I meant haha
2007-12-16T12:44:00.000Z	LordDicranius	Gnea	maybe my fingers were thinking "CTRL" when I tried it haha
2007-12-16T12:45:00.000Z	LordDicranius	Gnea	haha true
2007-12-16T12:46:00.000Z	LordDicranius	Gnea	E17 = Enlightenment?
2007-12-16T12:46:00.000Z	Gnea	LordDicranius	yes
2007-12-16T12:46:00.000Z	LordDicranius	Gnea	thanks.  gonna have to try that soon.  how do u think E17 compares to fluxbox?
2007-12-16T12:47:00.000Z	Gnea	LordDicranius	i like e17 better, but i haven't tried it much on legacy systems
2007-12-16T12:48:00.000Z	LordDicranius	Gnea	I see.  I just installed fluxbox on a spare PC I test stuff out on, and all the apps seem to run slow on it :-\  I was gonna try Enlightenment next
2007-12-16T12:49:00.000Z	LordDicranius	Gnea	it is a pretty old/basic PC though.  Running Gnome puts some strain on it haha
2007-12-16T12:50:00.000Z	Gnea	LordDicranius	fluxbox tends to run pretty well on any system, e17 tends to run alright too
