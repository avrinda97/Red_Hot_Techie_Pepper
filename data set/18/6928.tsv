2008-03-02T06:31:00.000Z	Peaker		Hey, how do I disable updatedb?
2008-03-02T06:31:00.000Z	Peaker		I never use updatedb/locate/these search facilities, but it slows me down horribly every day
2008-03-02T06:31:00.000Z	Peaker		Trying to get rid of the package containing updatedb yells at me that I must "know what I'm doing" because its an "essential package"
2008-03-02T06:33:00.000Z	Peaker		(instead of indexing changes as they happen :-( )
2008-03-02T06:35:00.000Z	tlhonmey	Peaker	 set it to run with minimum priority.
2008-03-02T06:36:00.000Z	Peaker	tlhonmey	does low priority affect its disk I/O performance, and its making lots of disk noise too?
2008-03-02T06:37:00.000Z	tlhonmey	Peaker	 hmmm...  I've never tested that.
2008-03-02T06:39:00.000Z	tlhonmey	Peaker	Under System->Preferences->indexing preferences you can just turn it off.
2008-03-02T06:39:00.000Z	Peaker	tlhonmey	any kubuntu equivalent for my other machine?
2008-03-02T06:39:00.000Z	tlhonmey	Peaker	and it appears to watch your home directory.
2008-03-02T06:40:00.000Z	Peaker	tlhonmey	appearantly its big enough for it to thrash the disk for quite a while
2008-03-02T06:40:00.000Z	tlhonmey	Peaker	I don't know.  I don't use kubuntu much.  It usually has the same options though, just organised differently.
2008-03-02T06:40:00.000Z	Peaker	tlhonmey	ok, thanks
2008-03-02T06:41:00.000Z	tlhonmey	Peaker	 give me a moment...
2008-03-02T06:42:00.000Z	tlhonmey	Peaker	the program is named tracker-preferences.  try typing that in a shell.
2008-03-02T06:42:00.000Z	Peaker	tlhonmey	its part of tracker-search-tool, appearantly not a part of kubuntu
2008-03-02T06:44:00.000Z	tlhonmey	Peaker	 dang.  I guess kubuntu uses something completely different then.  Browse the menu I guess.
2008-03-02T06:44:00.000Z	Peaker	tlhonmey	will do, thanks
