2009-08-04T12:25:00.000Z	clane		how do i load a module on startup?
2009-08-04T12:25:00.000Z	clane		tried in /etc/modules
2009-08-04T12:25:00.000Z	Gnea	clane	try /etc/modprobe.d/
2009-08-04T12:27:00.000Z	clane	Gnea	all i see are blacklists ?
2009-08-04T12:28:00.000Z	Gnea	clane	yes, make sure your module isn't listed there
2009-08-04T12:30:00.000Z	clane	Gnea	trying to load module ip_conntrack_ftp its not blacklsited
2009-08-04T12:30:00.000Z	Gnea	clane	iptables should load it
2009-08-04T12:30:00.000Z	clane	Gnea	it doesn't :[ - everytime i reboot my server passive mode FTP doesn't work
2009-08-04T12:33:00.000Z	Gnea	clane	how are you putting it into passive mode?
2009-08-04T12:34:00.000Z	clane	Gnea	vsftpd config passive is enabled, not sure what you mean exactly
2009-08-04T12:35:00.000Z	Gnea	clane	that's exactly it. do you have port 20 opened as well?
2009-08-04T12:35:00.000Z	clane	Gnea	no, that is for active ftp only i thought?
2009-08-04T12:35:00.000Z	Gnea	clane	perhaps you don't understand the difference between regular and passive ftp....
2009-08-04T12:36:00.000Z	Gnea	clane	might want to give this a good gleam before continuing: http://slacksite.com/other/ftp.html
2009-08-04T12:37:00.000Z	clane	Gnea	when i run 'modprobe ip_conntrack_ftp' my ftp connection starts working fine
2009-08-04T12:40:00.000Z	clane	Gnea	after reading that page, passive ftp doesn't seem to require port 20 at all
2009-08-04T12:43:00.000Z	clane	Gnea	sorry to waste your time! I had 'modprobe ip_conntrack_ftp' in the /etc/modules file instead of just 'ip_conntrack_ftp'
2009-08-04T12:43:00.000Z	Gnea	clane	lol, good catch - np
