2010-08-29T09:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nooby-doo	can you use http://pastie.org    to give the output of: lsb_release -a; uname -a; dpkg -l | grep flash; dpkg -l | grep gnash; dpkg -l | grep swf     thanks
2010-08-29T09:09:00.000Z	nooby-doo	ActionParsnip	sure, gimme a moment please
2010-08-29T09:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nooby-doo	it's just one command, run it then copy all the output in one
2010-08-29T09:14:00.000Z	nooby-doo	ActionParsnip	http://pastie.org/1123528
2010-08-29T09:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nooby-doo	ok well you have too many flash plugins so they conflict and you get nothing. I'll give you one big command to clear you up
2010-08-29T09:16:00.000Z	nooby-doo	ActionParsnip	that would be awesome
2010-08-29T09:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nooby-doo	can you also use pastie to give the output of: lsb_release -a    thanks

2010-08-29T09:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nooby-doo	sweet, ok copy that whole command, paste it into a terminal and let it rip. After, you will ONLY have adobe's flash and it will work
2010-08-29T09:28:00.000Z	nooby-doo	ActionParsnip	worked like a charm bro, thanks a ton
2010-08-29T09:28:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	nooby-doo	flash is easy dude, just keep to ONE plugin and you will be problem free
