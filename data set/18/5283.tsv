2011-08-06T23:45:00.000Z	needhelp1		looking for some help with rsync, user@user:~$ rsync -n /home/user/Downloads/ /media/External\ Seagate/
2011-08-06T23:45:00.000Z	needhelp1		skipping directory .
2011-08-06T23:47:00.000Z	yeats	needhelp1	try 'rsync -avn ...' (then remove the -n when you really do it)
2011-08-06T23:48:00.000Z	needhelp1	yeats	by the three periods, do you mean there has to be three spaces
2011-08-06T23:48:00.000Z	yeats	needhelp1	no - three periods was a "continue with the rest of the command" ;-)
2011-08-06T23:48:00.000Z	needhelp1	yeats	k thanks, trying now
2011-08-06T23:51:00.000Z	needhelp1	yeats	so that worked, but the log of all the files to be changed was to long, i cant scroll through them all, any ideas?
2011-08-06T23:52:00.000Z	yeats	needhelp1	go to the /media/External\ Seagate/ directory and do 'ls -la' to make sure everything's there
2011-08-06T23:52:00.000Z	yeats	needhelp1	rsync will report any errors at the end
2011-08-07T00:07:00.000Z	needhelp1	yeats	i only did a test run with -n
2011-08-07T00:08:00.000Z	yeats	needhelp1	still having trouble?
2011-08-07T00:08:00.000Z	needhelp1	yeats	yeah, when it returns the list of files to be changed, the list is to long to view in terminal, it wont let me scroll the whole list
2011-08-07T00:09:00.000Z	yeats	needhelp1	add '| less' to the end of the command
2011-08-07T00:09:00.000Z	needhelp1	yeats	what does that do
2011-08-07T00:09:00.000Z	yeats	needhelp1	it pipes the output into a paging program called "less"
2011-08-07T00:09:00.000Z	yeats	needhelp1	then you can page through the output
2011-08-07T00:13:00.000Z	needhelp1	yeats	is it possible to only copy folders
2011-08-07T00:19:00.000Z	yeats	needhelp1	I don't know - you might try looking at the rsync documentation for options for just folders
