2011-03-01T21:02:00.000Z	got_grubed	arand	 you mean this? sudo mount --bind /dev /mnt/dev ?
2011-03-01T21:02:00.000Z	arand	got_grubed	Indeed
2011-03-01T21:24:00.000Z	got_grubed	arand	something is wrong. it doesnt read the usb.
2011-03-01T21:25:00.000Z	got_grubed	arand	maybe because i changed the bootloader in hdd
2011-03-01T21:26:00.000Z	arand	got_grubed	Hmm, that sounds more like the computer not being set to boot from the usb
2011-03-01T21:27:00.000Z	got_grubed	arand	it is . i changed in the bios
2011-03-01T21:27:00.000Z	got_grubed	arand	when i try to boot from disk it shows Minimal BASH-like line editing is supported
2011-03-01T21:29:00.000Z	arand	got_grubed	But anyways, the instructions you posted there on the forum are likely the ones you'd want to follow if you want to reinstall grub to mbr, and update the menu files. Just make sure you have the /boot you are using mounted under /mnt/boot, if you have a separate boot partition you'll have to moun it separately after mounting the / partition.
2011-03-01T21:32:00.000Z	got_grubed	arand	im gonna do this https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2#Reinstalling chroot method step by step
2011-03-01T21:34:00.000Z	arand	got_grubed	That sounds reasonable.

2011-03-01T21:41:00.000Z	arand	got_grubed	If sda6 is root and sda7 is home, mount sda6 and you should be able to see the /mnt/boot/grub directory, and use the command sacarlson suggests, if that doesn't work, try chrooting.
2011-03-01T22:12:00.000Z	arand	got_grubed	it may be that your terminal is browsing in /mnt or so, but anyways, it will automatically unmount when you reboot/shutdown
2011-03-01T22:16:00.000Z	arand	got_grubed	glad it worked :)
2011-03-01T22:18:00.000Z	arand	got_grubed	For next time when you install on a usb stick it's good to tell the installation program to install grub to the usb stick (/dev/sdb or so), instead of overwriting the mbr.
2011-03-01T22:22:00.000Z	got_grubed	arand	thank you and all other ppl for having time to help me
2011-03-01T22:23:00.000Z	got_grubed	arand	I used Ubuntu default install it didnt provide any option for bootloader :\
