2007-09-28T16:46:00.000Z	Gin		whenever I use firefox with flash, the cpu usage is at 90%+ is this normal?
2007-09-28T16:47:00.000Z	erUSUL	Gin	not in my experience
2007-11-06T14:40:00.000Z	erUSUL	Gin	pmount /dev/xxxx (where xxxx is the partition device)
2007-11-06T14:40:00.000Z	erUSUL	Gin	pmount /dev/sdf1
2007-11-06T14:42:00.000Z	erUSUL	Gin	that's the way it is supposed to work
2007-11-06T14:42:00.000Z	erUSUL	Gin	unix commands do not say anything when they succeed
2007-11-06T14:42:00.000Z	erUSUL	Gin	check your media folder
2007-11-06T14:43:00.000Z	erUSUL	Gin	;)
2007-11-06T14:43:00.000Z	erUSUL	Gin	well that i dunno... it should have done so
2007-11-06T14:51:00.000Z	erUSUL	Gin	as i said to import that will fail if the devices names change (if you plug another card or usb/firewoire sata disk etc to your computer)
2007-11-06T14:52:00.000Z	erUSUL	Gin	but it would work as a workaraund most of the time
2007-11-06T15:01:00.000Z	erUSUL	Gin	use sleep 3 as intermediate command
2007-11-06T15:02:00.000Z	Gin	erUSUL	like this? pmount /dev/sdf1 & sleep 3 & nautilus /media/sdf1
2007-11-06T15:03:00.000Z	erUSUL	Gin	e.g.  pmount /dev/sdf1 && sleep 3 && nautilus /media/sdf1
2007-11-06T15:03:00.000Z	erUSUL	Gin	you need double &
2008-10-09T02:26:00.000Z	erUSUL	Gin	"sudo touch /forcefsck"
2008-10-09T02:27:00.000Z	Gin	erUSUL	how can you tell i de defragment the partitions?
2008-10-09T02:27:00.000Z	erUSUL	Gin	no defragmenters in linux (except xfs afaik)
