2011-12-23T05:29:00.000Z	ben_		Alright, I've got a problem....I have ubuntu 11.10 installed on my mac mini with a windows xp virtual machine installed on it....I'm trying to get video off my camcorder that is stored in DV format...how do I do that?
2011-12-23T05:30:00.000Z	jutnux	ben_	Surely you could just drag and drop the video file?
2011-12-23T05:30:00.000Z	jutnux	ben_	If you mean in the VM then you need to install guest additions and share a usb device (in the VBox settings).
2011-12-23T05:30:00.000Z	ben_		The cable to transfer the video is a IEEE 1394 b to firewire 400
2011-12-23T05:31:00.000Z	ben_		It doesn't pick up the firewire port though....any ideas why?
2011-12-23T05:31:00.000Z	ben_		It's an old camcorder but I need it for christmas
2011-12-23T05:31:00.000Z	jutnux	ben_	Follow what I said.
2011-12-23T05:32:00.000Z	ben_		I've already got guest additions installed...it can't see the firewire
2011-12-23T05:32:00.000Z	jutnux		You have to share it in the virtual box settings ben_

2011-12-23T05:33:00.000Z	ben_		alright, thank you I'll take a look at that tutorial
2011-12-23T05:33:00.000Z	ben_		VirtualBox PUEL edition?
2011-12-23T05:34:00.000Z	jutnux	ben_	Will work on all of them.
2011-12-23T05:34:00.000Z	ben_		someguy...no firewire support?
2011-12-23T05:35:00.000Z	jutnux	ben_	Try it anyway.
2011-12-23T05:35:00.000Z	ben_	jutnux	is there firewire support in virtual box?  do you know ?
2011-12-23T05:36:00.000Z	jutnux	ben_	Clearly not then. Try VMWare.
2011-12-23T05:37:00.000Z	ben_	jutnux	someguy ...."That hardware is becoming more rare these days and VB does not support it."...crap!
