2011-04-03T14:44:00.000Z	siddhantchd		i m trying to run amarok but when i try to play a track it doesnt play any
2011-04-03T14:44:00.000Z	siddhantchd		i m running ubuntu 10.10
2011-04-03T14:44:00.000Z	tanath	siddhantchd	first, get a better media player :P
2011-04-03T14:44:00.000Z	tanath	siddhantchd	banshee
2011-04-03T14:48:00.000Z	tanath	siddhantchd	audacious is good for playing certain things (just music) like emulated/game music... banshee is a good all-purpose media player
2011-04-03T14:49:00.000Z	siddhantchd	tanath	oki bro will try them both
2011-04-03T14:49:00.000Z	tanath	siddhantchd	don't hurt to keep them both around. but amarok has been doing a lot of stupid stuff over the past couple years
2011-04-03T14:50:00.000Z	siddhantchd	tanath	yea amarok isnt working only , it doesnt play any tpye of music
2011-04-03T14:51:00.000Z	tanath	siddhantchd	you might be able to check amarok's settings and choose a different engine. that might work, but i'd recommend changing it for a better player anyway
2011-04-03T14:51:00.000Z	siddhantchd	tanath	yea i will be changing it for sure
2011-04-03T14:51:00.000Z	tanath	siddhantchd	it's sad. amarok used to be the best
2011-04-03T14:52:00.000Z	siddhantchd	tanath	that wht i had also heard, actually i m new to linux so trying to adjust and get the best software i can
2011-04-03T14:53:00.000Z	tanath	siddhantchd	in that case, grab ubuntu-tweak. lots of goodies there made easy to install
2011-04-03T14:53:00.000Z	siddhantchd	tanath	okie but i wanna learn the correct way
2011-04-03T14:54:00.000Z	tanath	siddhantchd	it's not incorrect.. just makes things easier
2011-04-03T14:54:00.000Z	siddhantchd	tanath	okie,, can i pm u and talk ? need help wid a few things
2011-04-03T14:55:00.000Z	tanath	siddhantchd	sure
