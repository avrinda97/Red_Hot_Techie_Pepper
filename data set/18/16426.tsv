2010-06-10T18:13:00.000Z	mks1992		can somebody help me with a keyboard shortcut for terminal
2010-06-10T18:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mks1992	 if you want 'quick access' to a terminal you may want to check out that guake tool.
2010-06-10T18:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mks1992	 theres several terminal programs out  'xterm' 'xfterminal' 'terminal' 'gnome-terminal'
2010-06-10T18:17:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mks1992	 and more.....
2010-06-10T18:27:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mks1992	 clarify what that even means..
2010-06-10T18:30:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mks1992	 perhaps start over from the beginning with what you are trying to do exactly
2010-06-10T18:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mks1992	 via an icon....
2010-06-10T18:34:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mks1992	 read the docs the bot  are posting
2010-06-10T18:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mks1992	 clarify what you mean by 'shortcut'
2010-06-10T18:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mks1992	 You are using xfce/xubuntu ?
2010-06-10T18:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mks1992	 i would suggest axking in #xubuntu and checking the XFCE docs/homepage for manuals/guides
2010-06-10T18:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mks1992	 Why are you usint xubuntu instead of the normal ubuntu anyway?
2010-06-10T18:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mks1992	 thats a bit of a myth in many ways.. You have a old/slower machine? thatn i could see a reason.. if you have a decently mondern machine.. I suggest you go with ubuntu
2010-06-10T18:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mks1992	 if you have a VERY low end machine 'lubuntu' is even lighter then xubuntu
2010-06-10T18:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mks1992	 but theres a cost for 'lightness' :) often lack of features
2010-06-10T18:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mks1992	 thats trivial to do
2010-06-10T18:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mks1992	 you can install ubuntu, then have xubuntu, kubuntu, lubuntu, and proberly others all installed on the same system and just pick what one to use from the Login screen
2010-06-10T18:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	mks1992	 mixxing in so many desktops can lead to cluttered menus.. but its not  a Huge problem.
