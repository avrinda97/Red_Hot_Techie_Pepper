2010-05-20T20:39:00.000Z	linuxmonster		I need a suggestion, my old site used Postnuke which i loved however thats now depricated. And my host allows others like PhpBB, Drupal, Joomla. I wanted to use Zikula but could not any suggestions on what is similar in look and ease to Postnuke was?
2010-05-20T20:41:00.000Z	Vigo	linuxmonster	There are many, have you looked at Dans?
2010-05-20T20:41:00.000Z	linuxmonster		mauren tail -f /var/log/name-of-log  should allow you to see
2010-05-20T20:42:00.000Z	linuxmonster	Vigo	 looked at a few others but the host lets certain apps and not others. I really wanted Zikula but no interface for it or I did something wrong (It was late afterall) lol
2010-05-20T20:43:00.000Z	Vigo	linuxmonster	Are you blocking content or is that the intent?
2010-05-20T20:44:00.000Z	linuxmonster	Vigo	 I am not blocking anything to be honest, its a BSD based webhost and they install nothing as its pay as you go.
2010-05-20T20:44:00.000Z	Vigo	linuxmonster	I see now, was just looking at the site, Blogging?
2010-05-20T20:45:00.000Z	linuxmonster	Vigo	 I like the host as its no frills, you pay only for what bandwidth/storage you use not a flat fee permonth type thing. Just a bugger to setup lol
2010-05-20T20:45:00.000Z	Vigo	linuxmonster	Do you have alien marked in the Package Manager?
2010-05-20T20:46:00.000Z	linuxmonster	Vigo	 give you a better idea here is a link to my old site in the internet time machine http://web.archive.org/web/20030217033734/http://linuxmonster.org/ takes a minute or so to load
2010-05-20T20:46:00.000Z	linuxmonster		Okay maybe it takes 4 mins to load lol
2010-05-20T20:55:00.000Z	Vigo	linuxmonster	Something like Bluefish or am missing the track here?
2010-05-20T20:55:00.000Z	linuxmonster	Vigo	 you saw the archive of the site?
2010-05-20T20:57:00.000Z	Vigo	linuxmonster	Rechecking now...
2010-05-20T20:57:00.000Z	linuxmonster	Vigo	 takes like 4 mins to load as its a archive of the website 7 years ago lol
2010-05-20T20:58:00.000Z	Vigo	linuxmonster	That is what had me puzzled...
2010-05-20T20:59:00.000Z	linuxmonster		I think I will just try Zikula again even though they dont support it. If the host allows Drupal and Joomla then I cant see why Zikula would not work. I must have just been tired and missed something lastnight playing around
2010-05-20T21:00:00.000Z	Vigo	linuxmonster	We are getting rather off topic now, /msg me
