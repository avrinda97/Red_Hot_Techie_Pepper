But if netstat refuses to show it as listening, that could suggest a hacked netstat (possible rootkit, etc.). The responsible process will be listed in the far right column.
2011-04-20T15:11:00.000Z	xro2	rob_p	no... This is why i don't understand...
2011-04-20T15:15:00.000Z	rob_p	xro2	What don't you understand?  There *is* something listening on that port. *If* netstat refuses to show what process is bound to that port, then it's likely a hacked netstat.  And yes, even xinet will show up as a process in the list if it is bound to and listening on a port.
2011-04-20T15:16:00.000Z	xro2	rob_p	hacked netstat??? do you think that a hacker penetrate my system and then change the netstat soft?
2011-04-20T15:17:00.000Z	rob_p	xro2	It's possible, if everything you are telling us is true.
2011-04-20T15:17:00.000Z	rob_p	xro2	It would usually be part of a rootkit.
2011-04-20T15:18:00.000Z	xro2	rob_p	i will check it... but that appears a bit strange! my system is not so old and patched...
2011-04-20T15:19:00.000Z	rob_p	xro2	Well, I don't want you to panic, but you should definitely look into what's going on because it's a pretty fishy scenario...
2011-04-20T15:24:00.000Z	xro2	rob_p	ohhh, i cannot connect it from: telnet 127.0.0.1 554!   really strange...
2011-04-20T15:26:00.000Z	rob_p	xro2	It may not be listening on local loopback.
2011-04-20T15:30:00.000Z	xro2	rob_p	or it could be a firewall property?
2011-04-20T15:31:00.000Z	rob_p	xro2	The packet filtering rules won't affect netstat's ability to list ports/processes.
2011-04-20T15:32:00.000Z	xro2	rob_p	yes... but i have to check that the answer really comes from my server (not created by a FW)
2011-04-20T15:34:00.000Z	rob_p	xro2	I see where you're going... ok.  But you should remove all extraneous variables.  Plug in directly to the server (if possible) and rerun your analysis.
2011-04-20T15:40:00.000Z	xro2	rob_p	i will do it... i just checked my other servers and they all respond to this port... So, i get totally cracked or my firewall is playing with me...
2011-04-20T15:43:00.000Z	rob_p	xro2	Good luck!  Hope you find out what's going on.  Perhaps you have a firewall rule that redirects inbound tcp port 554 to some other server (or something along those lines) because that would explain it.
2011-04-20T15:44:00.000Z	xro2	rob_p	i have a rule that drop all traffic i didn't permit... so it could drop traffic to 554 port...
2011-04-20T15:45:00.000Z	xro2	rob_p	thanks... for your help
