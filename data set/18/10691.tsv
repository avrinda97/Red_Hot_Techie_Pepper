2007-07-11T13:05:00.000Z	dxdt	kbrooks	that is weird, it should just happen. try logging out or restarting. but yeah it should just happen with noo need to refresh
2007-07-11T13:18:00.000Z	kbrooks	dxdt	the change to root was removed from the wiki page, so please dont endorse that here.
2007-07-11T13:18:00.000Z	kbrooks	dxdt	tthank you
2007-07-11T13:18:00.000Z	dxdt	kbrooks	do you have access to update the bot?
2007-07-11T13:19:00.000Z	kbrooks	dxdt	you can ask for it to be updated.
2007-07-11T13:19:00.000Z	kbrooks	dxdt	only the ops have access to the bot.
2007-07-11T13:20:00.000Z	kbrooks	dxdt	no, it was removed by choice and for good reason.
2007-07-11T13:20:00.000Z	kbrooks	dxdt	only sudo is supported on ubuntu.
2007-07-11T13:22:00.000Z	kbrooks	dxdt	they shoul not do root, because it makes things hard for the user.
2007-07-11T13:22:00.000Z	dxdt	kbrooks	I disagree with you.  You should inform the user and let them choose.  Not just remove the page because you think it is better for them.
2007-07-11T13:22:00.000Z	kbrooks	dxdt	really?
2007-07-11T13:23:00.000Z	kbrooks	dxdt	not for new users.
2007-07-11T13:23:00.000Z	kbrooks	dxdt	new users shouldn't have too much choice. it is very confusing for them
2007-07-11T13:25:00.000Z	kbrooks	dxdt	go to #ubuntu-offtopic if you want to debate further
