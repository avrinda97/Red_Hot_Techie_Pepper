2006-09-17T16:26:00.000Z	kovan		why do i get "the file is not a sound stream" when importing mp3s to my library in Rhythmbox??
2006-09-17T16:27:00.000Z	tedivm	kovan	where did you get the mp3's from?
2006-09-17T16:27:00.000Z	tedivm		like, i had that issue when importing songs i bought off of itunes
2006-09-17T16:27:00.000Z	tedivm		which is making me feel better about not paying for music
2006-09-17T16:29:00.000Z	kovan	tedivm	i ripped them, could be the fact that they are in VBR the problem?
2006-09-17T16:29:00.000Z	tedivm	kovan	how knew is this ubuntu install?
2006-09-17T16:29:00.000Z	kovan	tedivm	brand new
2006-09-17T16:29:00.000Z	tedivm		i know you need to install the mp3 stuff seperately
2006-09-17T16:29:00.000Z	tedivm		hold on a second
2006-09-17T16:30:00.000Z	kovan		ok
2006-09-17T16:31:00.000Z	kovan		btw, flash 9 is available for ubuntu?

2006-09-17T16:33:00.000Z	kovan	tedivm	thank you, great page
2006-09-17T16:35:00.000Z	tedivm		hmm, i don't know about the rest of you, but i'm wondering why making fun of a dead man is a killable offense
2006-09-17T16:36:00.000Z	tedivm		its uncool, yea, but on every irc netowkr i've fun they've always let channel shit happen in the channel- ie, an op in here should have spanked him
2006-09-17T16:36:00.000Z	tedivm		this is personal opinion though, i really don't care that much
2006-09-17T16:36:00.000Z	tedivm		ahh
2006-09-17T16:38:00.000Z	kovan	tedivm	and then what?
