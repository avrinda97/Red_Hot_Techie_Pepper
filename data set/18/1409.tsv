2011-02-27T05:26:00.000Z	MrMintanet		How do I open the File Manager as a root user?  I try to check the box on the share settings that enables "guest connections", and I can not check the box because it is greyed out.  Help?
2011-02-27T05:28:00.000Z	MrMintanet		How can I verify that samba is running?
2011-02-27T05:28:00.000Z	MrMintanet		How can I verify that samba is not corrupt?
2011-02-27T05:29:00.000Z	Lumenary	MrMintanet	open Terminal
2011-02-27T05:31:00.000Z	Lumenary	MrMintanet	 SAMBA is running
2011-02-27T05:31:00.000Z	MrMintanet	Lumenary	I can not access my shares from my Win7 computer.  How should I start troubleshooting?  I have a good ping between the computers.
2011-02-27T05:33:00.000Z	Lumenary	MrMintanet	 I need more information...  What kind of Linux machine is hosting the SAMBA shares?
2011-02-27T05:33:00.000Z	MrMintanet	Lumenary	10.10 Desktop
2011-02-27T05:34:00.000Z	MrMintanet	Lumenary	I have.  They are def. shared and even allow users to modify file contents
2011-02-27T05:35:00.000Z	Lumenary	MrMintanet	 Right-click one of your shared folders and open the sharing properties
2011-02-27T05:38:00.000Z	MrMintanet	Lumenary	Yes... :)
2011-02-27T05:38:00.000Z	Lumenary	MrMintanet	 OK, next, open a terminal and issue the following command:
2011-02-27T05:40:00.000Z	MrMintanet	Lumenary	both usernames and passwords are the same on both machines.
2011-02-27T05:40:00.000Z	MrMintanet	Lumenary	Still unaccessible.... :(
2011-02-27T05:41:00.000Z	MrMintanet	Lumenary	I will tackle this problem later.  I am sure that I messed up samba somehow by installing GADMIN Tools
2011-02-27T05:44:00.000Z	MrMintanet	Lumenary	I guess I'll just use a thumb drive for now!  DOH!
2011-02-27T05:46:00.000Z	Lumenary	MrMintanet	 Google returned this:  http://www.liberiangeek.net/2010/05/how-to-easily-manage-samba-with-swat-in-ubuntu-10-04-lucid-lynx/
2011-02-27T05:46:00.000Z	Lumenary	MrMintanet	 10.10 would be similar
