2009-02-14T03:15:00.000Z	doc`		ok, have a wireless card that isnt working
2009-02-14T03:16:00.000Z	doc`		in windows it is some ralink card
2009-02-14T03:16:00.000Z	doc`		but its hard finding out exactly which card it is
2009-02-14T03:16:00.000Z	doc`		sorry
2009-02-14T03:16:00.000Z	nightrid3r	doc`	did you update your install, ralink works in the latest kernel
2009-02-14T03:17:00.000Z	nightrid3r	doc`	whats the exact type of ralink
2009-02-14T03:19:00.000Z	nightrid3r	doc`	maybe check the asus or ralink site for new drivers
2009-02-14T03:21:00.000Z	nightrid3r	doc`	its going to be hard helping if we don't know the exact ralink type you have
2009-02-14T03:21:00.000Z	nightrid3r	doc`	try sudo lshw in a terminal
2009-02-14T03:26:00.000Z	doc`	nightrid3r	http://pastebin.com/m698a893b, but doesnt give me any more info
2009-02-14T03:27:00.000Z	nightrid3r	doc`	link doesn't work
2009-02-14T03:32:00.000Z	nightrid3r	doc`	try lspci
2009-02-14T03:35:00.000Z	nightrid3r	doc`	thats all it say for the ralink?
2009-02-14T03:41:00.000Z	nightrid3r	doc`	hmm there's only 3 kernel modules for pci cards
2009-02-14T03:41:00.000Z	nightrid3r	doc`	theres for 2400 2500 and 61 model
2009-02-14T03:42:00.000Z	nightrid3r	doc`	ow i don't think there's much support for N type cards :(
2009-02-14T03:43:00.000Z	nightrid3r	doc`	so i guess ndiswrapper with windows driver is the way to go at the moment
2009-02-14T03:44:00.000Z	nightrid3r	doc`	sudo apt-get install ndiswrapper
