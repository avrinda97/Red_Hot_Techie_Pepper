2005-06-04T10:02:00.000Z	josh_		So will anyone help me install java? I already have the stupid file, but its not installing
2005-06-04T10:03:00.000Z	justin	josh_	it would probably help if you explained what "not installing" means
2005-06-04T10:04:00.000Z	justin	josh_	it says "the folder does not exist"?
2005-06-04T10:05:00.000Z	justin	josh_	how else do you expect anyone to tell you what is wrong?
2005-06-04T10:06:00.000Z	justin	josh_	and what did you type to get it to output that?
2005-06-04T10:07:00.000Z	justin	josh_	and what would that be?
2005-06-04T10:08:00.000Z	justin	josh_	maybe you should make that directory first?
2005-06-04T10:08:00.000Z	justin	josh_	maybe you should be doing what the instructions say as root?
2005-06-04T10:09:00.000Z	justin	josh_	you obviously didn't
2005-06-04T10:09:00.000Z	justin	josh_	why not?
2005-06-04T10:10:00.000Z	justin	josh_	well it didn't say, "sorry, I am not allowing you to change files in /usr/local", so what did it actually say
2005-06-04T10:10:00.000Z	justin	josh_	what is "it"?
2005-06-04T10:11:00.000Z	justin	josh_	the part about you not bothing to give actual, real, error messages and instead your flawed interpretations of them
2005-06-04T10:12:00.000Z	justin	josh_	why can't you do it?
2005-06-04T10:12:00.000Z	justin	josh_	weren't you just talking about some instructions?
2005-06-04T10:12:00.000Z	justin	josh_	why can't you make new folders?
2005-06-04T10:13:00.000Z	justin	josh_	YOU are the one sitting in front of YOUR computer
2005-06-04T10:32:00.000Z	justin	josh_	ffs, it's the same command as before
