2009-02-22T14:53:00.000Z	DPCP		Hey guys, I need help with a problem, I'm not getting any sound out of my speakers..
2009-02-22T14:53:00.000Z	thijs_	DPCP	are your mixer settings correct?
2009-02-22T14:56:00.000Z	DPCP	thijs_	Yea, they are fine, my friend suggested that my speakers weren't set as the default playing device but I'm not quite sure how to set them..  Running: xubuntu
2009-02-22T14:57:00.000Z	thijs_	DPCP	Ah, i wouldn't know where in X these settings are, can you configure your sound device through the soundspeaker icon in your tray?
2009-02-22T14:57:00.000Z	DPCP	thijs_	Hang on a second I'll check.
2009-02-22T14:58:00.000Z	DPCP	thijs_	Good call, I was able to set it as the default device alright.  I'll just test it now, brb.
2009-02-22T14:58:00.000Z	thijs_	DPCP	good luck :)
2009-02-22T14:59:00.000Z	DPCP	thijs_	No luck :(.  Could it be a problem with gstreamer?
2009-02-22T15:00:00.000Z	thijs_	DPCP	Are the settings for all devices you can configure through that interface set correctly? try messing with different setting combinations for the devices, I'm runing gnome, and I've found that only some configurations work correctly (especially when you have multiple sound outputs)
2009-02-22T15:01:00.000Z	DPCP	thijs_	I'm a noob to linux, and I'm afraid I didn't quite follow that..
2009-02-22T15:01:00.000Z	DPCP	thijs_	How do I mess with the settings?
2009-02-22T15:01:00.000Z	thijs_	DPCP	ah, ok, well, are the volume levels for your device set correctly?
2009-02-22T15:01:00.000Z	DPCP	thijs_	I think so.
2009-02-22T15:02:00.000Z	thijs_	DPCP	for instance, if you select the proper default device for playback, are all the switches set to full volume?
2009-02-22T15:02:00.000Z	DPCP	thijs_	NOpe they aren't all set to full.
2009-02-22T15:03:00.000Z	thijs_	DPCP	try setting them to full, on all possible devices, and then go through each device, testing whether the sound works
2009-02-22T15:03:00.000Z	DPCP	thijs_	oh god lol..  Brb.
2009-02-22T15:05:00.000Z	DPCP	thijs_	I'll get my friend to come up later and have a look at it :P  Thanks for all the help though! :)
