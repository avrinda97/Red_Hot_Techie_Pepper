2009-01-31T06:07:00.000Z	leeping2007		I'm getting a strange error when my client tries to connect to the network.  It says: "dh-client-script permission denied"
2009-01-31T06:07:00.000Z	leeping2007		Anyone seen this error before?
2009-01-31T06:07:00.000Z	unkmar	leeping2007	running as root?
2009-01-31T06:09:00.000Z	unkmar	leeping2007	my other thought is a script that isn't set to executable. :/
2009-01-31T06:11:00.000Z	leeping2007	unkmar	if I "ls -ltr" the file, it shows up as red .. this mean anything to you?
2009-01-31T06:11:00.000Z	unkmar	leeping2007	yeah, background read means executes as root from any user.
2009-01-31T06:12:00.000Z	leeping2007	unkmar	when I chgrp'ed it, the red went away :P I don't know how to set it back, heh
2009-01-31T06:12:00.000Z	unkmar	leeping2007	chmod 7777 filename
2009-01-31T06:13:00.000Z	leeping2007	unkmar	thanks :)
2009-01-31T06:17:00.000Z	unkmar	leeping2007	do tell.
2009-01-31T06:18:00.000Z	unkmar	leeping2007	oh,  user numbers shifted.
2009-01-31T06:19:00.000Z	unkmar	leeping2007	you would have been better off to change the user numbers to match the appropriate file.  group?
2009-01-31T06:19:00.000Z	leeping2007	unkmar	the problem is I forgot to back up my "group" file.  I'm predicting that I have to reinstall to get the old file back
2009-01-31T06:19:00.000Z	unkmar	leeping2007	not my point.
2009-01-31T06:21:00.000Z	leeping2007	unkmar	here's my interpretation.  My master computer has an old operating system (Gutsy) while the client machine has Hardy
2009-01-31T06:22:00.000Z	leeping2007	unkmar	is that closer to the truth?
2009-01-31T06:22:00.000Z	unkmar	leeping2007	exactly.  I don't know an easy solution.  My concern is that many other files may suffer the same fate.
2009-01-31T06:24:00.000Z	leeping2007	unkmar	that's exactly what I'm worried about.  I may have to reinstall because I don't know how the numbers got changed ...
