2005-02-23T13:44:00.000Z	e_machinist		Hey, I was wondering what kind of support ubuntu has for ATI cards?
2005-02-23T13:44:00.000Z	e_machinist		Does it use a package system for installing software?
2005-02-23T13:44:00.000Z	bob2	e_machinist	same as every other distrubution
2005-02-23T13:44:00.000Z	bob2	e_machinist	of course
2005-02-23T13:44:00.000Z	bob2	e_machinist	it's based on Debian
2005-04-11T14:12:00.000Z	bob2	e_machinist	read the instructions that came with it
2005-04-11T14:13:00.000Z	e_machinist	bob2	No instructions came with it... I got it from ftp.idsoftware.com
2005-04-11T15:16:00.000Z	bob2	e_machinist	only if it needs to
2005-04-11T15:16:00.000Z	e_machinist	bob2	how would I go about running fsck manually?
2005-04-11T15:17:00.000Z	bob2	e_machinist	boot into single user mode ("recovery" I think it's called on the grub menu), remount / ro, run fsck
2005-04-16T13:31:00.000Z	bob2	e_machinist	it doesn't, and you don't need one
2005-04-16T13:33:00.000Z	bob2	e_machinist	are you behind a dsl router or whatever?
2005-04-16T13:34:00.000Z	bob2	e_machinist	and your internet connection is ...
2005-04-16T13:34:00.000Z	e_machinist	bob2	dialup
2005-04-16T13:34:00.000Z	bob2	e_machinist	ubuntu runs no services by default
2005-04-16T13:35:00.000Z	bob2	e_machinist	so unless you install extra stuff you're worried about, you don' need to worry...
2005-04-16T13:40:00.000Z	bob2	e_machinist	some computer people are trying to sell you stuff
2005-04-16T13:40:00.000Z	bob2	e_machinist	and windows is poorly configured by default with a variety of running and exploitable services
