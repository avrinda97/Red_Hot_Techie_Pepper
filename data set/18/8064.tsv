2007-10-19T08:28:00.000Z	squee		I'm trying to play something with mplayer and I'm getting "alsa-lib: pcm_hw.c:1242:(snd_pcm_hw_open) open /dev/snd/pcmC0D0p failed: Device or resource busy"  Is there something I can do to force it to not be busy?
2007-10-19T08:29:00.000Z	dryrot	squee	does your sound work at all?  and are you using gnome (ubuntu)
2007-10-19T08:29:00.000Z	squee	dryrot	 It worked a while ago.  I am using gnome
2007-10-19T08:30:00.000Z	squee	dryrot	 I've had this happen in the past and it will work after I restart, but there has to be a better solution
2007-10-19T08:30:00.000Z	dryrot	squee	does your sound work right now?  try System->Preferences->Sound and see if it works
2007-10-19T08:31:00.000Z	squee	dryrot	 that does not work.  It says something about not being able to write to the device
2007-10-19T08:31:00.000Z	dryrot	squee	try changing your sound device in System->Preferences->Sound .  also are you in the 'audio' group?  try 'group YOURLOGINNAMEHERE'
2007-10-19T08:31:00.000Z	dryrot	squee	i mean 'groups' not group
2007-10-19T08:32:00.000Z	squee	dryrot	 It isn't a group issue.  using mplayer as root doesn't work either
2007-10-19T08:32:00.000Z	dryrot	squee	are you in the audio group?
2007-10-19T08:32:00.000Z	squee	dryrot	 yes
2007-10-19T08:33:00.000Z	dryrot	squee	can you play test sounds in the sound control panel ?
2007-10-19T08:33:00.000Z	squee	dryrot	 no
2007-10-19T08:35:00.000Z	dryrot	squee	there's a command to let the alsa utilities to go out and figure out which sound card it should be using, i think
2007-10-19T08:35:00.000Z	dryrot	squee	did your sound ever work ?
2007-10-19T08:36:00.000Z	squee	dryrot	 Yes.  It worked just a while ago.  There is some command to release all of the audio devices but i can't remember it
2007-10-19T08:36:00.000Z	dryrot	squee	what happens if you restart alsa ?
2007-10-19T08:38:00.000Z	squee	dryrot	 sudo /etc/init.d/alsa-utils restarts but still doesn't work
