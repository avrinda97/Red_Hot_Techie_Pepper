2007-09-19T11:46:00.000Z	briantumor		what boot parameter do i use to boot from floppy?
2007-09-19T11:46:00.000Z	briantumor		i'm talking to you!
2007-09-19T11:46:00.000Z	soundray	briantumor	you don't use a boot parameter
2007-09-19T11:46:00.000Z	soundray	briantumor	have some patience
2007-09-19T11:47:00.000Z	soundray	briantumor	what boot manager is installed?
2007-09-19T11:48:00.000Z	briantumor	soundray	grub
2007-09-19T11:48:00.000Z	soundray	briantumor	can you get the grub menu and drop to the command line?
2007-09-19T11:49:00.000Z	briantumor	soundray	the boot: prompt?
2007-09-19T11:49:00.000Z	soundray	briantumor	there is no boot: prompt in grub. You must have lilo installed.
2007-09-19T11:49:00.000Z	soundray	briantumor	why don't you just change it in the bios?
2007-09-19T11:51:00.000Z	soundray	briantumor	hmm, that's a fairly serious flaw. Is it a laptop or desktop?
2007-09-19T11:51:00.000Z	soundray	briantumor	open the case, remove the battery from the mainboard and leave it overnight. Chances are it will lose the password and go back to default settings.
2007-09-19T11:52:00.000Z	soundray	briantumor	like I've told you, no.
2007-09-19T11:52:00.000Z	soundray	briantumor	if you can boot from a CD, why bother with a floppy?
2007-09-19T11:52:00.000Z	briantumor	soundray	i can't boot from cd the regular way either
2007-09-19T11:54:00.000Z	soundray	briantumor	if you had grub, you might be able to chainload a boot floppy. But it sounds like you don't.
2007-09-19T11:58:00.000Z	soundray	briantumor	some machines will stop booting when you hit Pause, so you have time to note it down. Otherwise, use a digital camera.
