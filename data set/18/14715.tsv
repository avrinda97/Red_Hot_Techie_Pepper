2005-06-24T08:34:00.000Z	ac_		so, i'm having some problems installing ubuntu 5.04 from the pressed cd on a relatively recent vintage pc
2005-06-24T08:34:00.000Z	ac_		for some reason, i can't boot off the install cd, nor the live cd
2005-06-24T08:35:00.000Z	ac_		however, i have verified that i am able to boot off cd at all because i was able to boot off a windows cd
2005-06-24T08:35:00.000Z	ac_		(win2k)
2005-06-24T08:35:00.000Z	IIIEars	ac_	- Is your bios set up to boot from a CD?
2005-06-24T08:36:00.000Z	ac_	IIIEars	yes, i have booted off a win2k cd
2005-06-24T08:36:00.000Z	IIIEars	ac_	- both the install and live CD don't boot it is likely your pc. - though if it is the CD check your CD write speed or run a md5sum check on the images.
2005-06-24T08:37:00.000Z	ac_	IIIEars	this is the pressed cd
2005-06-24T08:37:00.000Z	IIIEars	ac_	- thats one variable eliminated.
2005-06-24T08:38:00.000Z	ac_	IIIEars	I also *just* booted and installed win2k from cd... about 10 minutes ago
2005-06-24T08:38:00.000Z	IIIEars	ac_	- well i am stumped - (sheepish grin)
2005-06-24T08:38:00.000Z	ac_	IIIEars	so am i... :/
2005-06-24T08:40:00.000Z	IIIEars	ac_	- all i can suggest is md5summing the disk. - unfortuneatly, a single read error (dust, fingerprint) will give you a bad number on an otherwise good CD.
2005-06-24T08:41:00.000Z	IIIEars	ac_	- try a different machine if you have another.
2005-06-24T08:42:00.000Z	ac_	IIIEars	-- so you've not heard of any limitations on install cd not liking the combination of booting off DVD and installing onto a SATA drive?
2005-06-24T08:43:00.000Z	IIIEars	ac_	- SATA is very common isn't it?
2005-06-24T08:43:00.000Z	ac_	IIIEars	erm I think SATA is prett popular these days
2005-06-24T08:44:00.000Z	IIIEars	ac_	- SCSI CDwas the older more difficult standard no?
