2009-09-20T23:01:00.000Z	ZoeyMarie		can someone help me troubleshoot some alsa problems I'm having with a sound program? (audacity)
2009-09-20T23:02:00.000Z	^mNotIntelligent	ZoeyMarie	go ahead
2009-09-20T23:03:00.000Z	ZoeyMarie	^mNotIntelligent	well, when I run audacity (either from terminal or not) it'll freeze when I try and play or record anything (before that it's fine), and in terminal it spits out some stuff, and alsa is in it, but I don't know what it means. Should I pastebin it?
2009-09-20T23:04:00.000Z	^mNotIntelligent	ZoeyMarie	that would be better....
2009-09-20T23:04:00.000Z	ZoeyMarie	^mNotIntelligent	well, I wouldn't pastebin it unless someone agreed to look at it first. So, I was just checking. ;)
2009-09-20T23:05:00.000Z	^mNotIntelligent	ZoeyMarie	then you miss the chance of gettting your prob fixed/looked-at
2009-09-20T23:07:00.000Z	ZoeyMarie	^mNotIntelligent	touche. Here's the pastebin: http://pastebin.com/m5203bd7
2009-09-20T23:07:00.000Z	^mNotIntelligent	ZoeyMarie	cool...
2009-09-20T23:12:00.000Z	ZoeyMarie	^mNotIntelligent	did you get a chance to look at the pastebin?
2009-09-20T23:12:00.000Z	^mNotIntelligent	ZoeyMarie	looking at it
2009-09-20T23:13:00.000Z	ZoeyMarie	^mNotIntelligent	thaaaank you.
2009-09-20T23:13:00.000Z	^mNotIntelligent	ZoeyMarie	np
2009-09-20T23:15:00.000Z	^mNotIntelligent	ZoeyMarie	google says its a bug. look here: http://lists.alioth.debian.org/pipermail/pkg-multimedia-maintainers/2009-February/002694.html
2009-09-20T23:16:00.000Z	ZoeyMarie	^mNotIntelligent	Dang... is there a way around that? Downgrading to before the regression or something?
2009-09-20T23:17:00.000Z	^mNotIntelligent	ZoeyMarie	downgrading should fix that making sure nothing else breaks up
2009-09-20T23:17:00.000Z	ZoeyMarie	^mNotIntelligent	thanks I'll try that. :)
2009-09-20T23:18:00.000Z	^mNotIntelligent	ZoeyMarie	np :-)
2009-09-20T23:23:00.000Z	ZoeyMarie	^mNotIntelligent	when I change the i/o settings in audacity preferences to alsa <default> instead of the default setting (alsa: intel ________) it will play music (no errors in terminal), but it's reaaaaally choppy and staticy. Is that better than doing the downgrade? (meaning is it something to work off of)
