2007-11-03T11:38:00.000Z	boontoo		ah ok
2007-11-03T11:39:00.000Z	Nallep	boontoo	 see  "man chmod" for all the things chmod can do
2007-11-03T11:39:00.000Z	boontoo		okay
2007-11-03T11:39:00.000Z	boontoo	Nallep	i am trying to execute files under wine as a chain meaning, the file i want to load requires an exe in the same directory i thought chowning them would solve the problem but it appears it doesnt
2007-11-03T11:40:00.000Z	Nallep	boontoo	in a script, you will need to execute the .exe by calling it with wine
2007-11-03T11:40:00.000Z	boontoo		hmm
2007-11-03T11:40:00.000Z	boontoo		i dont know how to write scripts
2007-11-03T11:40:00.000Z	Nallep	boontoo	instead of running the .exe like  myapp.exe  try   wine myapp.exe
2007-11-03T11:41:00.000Z	boontoo		ok
2007-11-03T11:44:00.000Z	boontoo	Nallep	nothing opens but no errors returned when i do wine w3l.exe
2007-11-03T11:45:00.000Z	Nallep	boontoo	you will probably have to check the wine forums to see if your app can run in wine, I can't help you much past here.
2007-11-03T11:46:00.000Z	boontoo		okay Nallep thanks anyway i guess its beacuse the exe i want to load hacks another exe itself so i guess wine cant really do that
2007-11-03T11:47:00.000Z	Nallep	boontoo	it probably can...if it's setup in the proper directory in your wine c drive (usually ~/.wine/ddrive_c)
2007-11-03T11:47:00.000Z	boontoo	Nallep	i didnt run the isntall just copied it from my windows directory but i set up the registry right i THINK
2007-11-03T11:48:00.000Z	Nallep	boontoo	have a look in your ~/.wine/drive_c folder and see if all the right application folders are in place for it to run properly
2007-11-03T11:48:00.000Z	boontoo	Nallep	yeh they are
2007-11-03T12:01:00.000Z	boontoo	Nallep	got it working now i just need to open the battlenet port i think
