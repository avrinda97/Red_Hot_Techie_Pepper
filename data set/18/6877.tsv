2008-06-28T05:41:00.000Z	nickrud	lensy	see !botabuxse ;)
2008-06-28T05:41:00.000Z	lensy	nickrud	dorry
2008-06-28T05:42:00.000Z	nickrud	lensy	what do you mean by not upgrading?
2008-06-28T05:43:00.000Z	nickrud	lensy	do  sudo apt-get -f install, then if it fails, put the complete output on paste.ubuntu.com
2008-06-28T05:44:00.000Z	nickrud	lensy	and you can install pastebinit to pastebin from the command line. Hit a key, that's probably just screen blanking
2008-06-28T05:47:00.000Z	nickrud	lensy	run sudo apt-get -f install   , and if it fails, you're going to look for   post-installation script failed, or pre-install script failed, and let me know what it was
2008-06-28T05:48:00.000Z	nickrud	lensy	there is a way to do that, but lets see if we can fix your system first
2008-06-28T05:50:00.000Z	nickrud	lensy	run sudo apt-get -f install, and tell me when it's done
2008-06-28T06:23:00.000Z	nickrud	lensy	yes, unless you take a couple steps
