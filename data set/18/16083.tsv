2005-01-29T07:37:00.000Z	phuzzy		how do i compile NTFS write support?
2005-01-29T07:39:00.000Z	phuzzy		i can mount the file system just fine -- in read only
2005-01-29T07:40:00.000Z	phuzzy		ok, so i guess my only other option is to copy everything from that partion to my ext3 partion, then reformat the partition?
2005-01-29T07:40:00.000Z	phuzzy		i feel like such an idiot... i don't know how to reformat partitions in linux
2005-01-29T07:40:00.000Z	phuzzy		lol to hell with windows ;)
2005-01-29T07:41:00.000Z	phuzzy		ok, i have another dumb question
2005-01-29T07:42:00.000Z	phuzzy		when i try to play my MP3s, it says i need a plugin to be able to play them.. have any of you ever ran into that problem before?
2005-01-29T07:42:00.000Z	phuzzy		how do i install it?
2005-01-29T07:43:00.000Z	phuzzy		like i said, i'm really new to debian
2005-01-29T07:45:00.000Z	phuzzy		is there anything i can read that will help me figure out how to do all of this?
2005-01-29T07:45:00.000Z	GammaRay	phuzzy	it's pretty simple in synaptic
2005-01-29T07:53:00.000Z	GammaRay	phuzzy	the one that has the URL http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ add universe multiverse to the Section(s) part
2005-01-29T07:54:00.000Z	GammaRay	phuzzy	URI rather
2005-01-29T07:55:00.000Z	GammaRay	phuzzy	sounds right
2005-01-29T07:56:00.000Z	GammaRay	phuzzy	it should have warned you about support
2005-01-29T07:56:00.000Z	GammaRay	phuzzy	did you click update as well?
2005-01-29T07:57:00.000Z	GammaRay	phuzzy	reload rather
2005-01-29T07:57:00.000Z	GammaRay	phuzzy	my mistake...
