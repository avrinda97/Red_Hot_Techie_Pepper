2009-12-28T22:10:00.000Z	datzy1		Hello, I am having some install issues.  I just installed 9.10 witht the alternate cd, when I boot, I only see shell login, and read only.
2009-12-28T22:12:00.000Z	thevishy	datzy1	i faced the issue - check for your grub menu does it say noasci etc  remove all that
2009-12-28T22:12:00.000Z	thevishy	datzy1	most probably u run an old comp and u used text based installation with noapi etc options , just edit all that and try !
2009-12-28T22:14:00.000Z	datzy1	thevishy	when I try to load grub menu, I get mountall main process terminated with status 1 General error mounting file systems A maintenance shell will now be started
2009-12-28T22:14:00.000Z	thevishy	datzy1	from where are you trying this ?
2009-12-28T22:14:00.000Z	datzy1	thevishy	from my desk
2009-12-28T22:15:00.000Z	thevishy	datzy1	i mean do u use the same system or different one ? what i said is that u reboot - go to grub and edit the parameters see if u have options like noapi etc on
2009-12-28T22:15:00.000Z	thevishy	datzy1	just type in startx and see what comes first
2009-12-28T22:15:00.000Z	datzy1	thevishy	oh, I'm on another system for irc
2009-12-28T22:16:00.000Z	datzy1	thevishy	I can't do anything, it's flahsing and I can't input
2009-12-28T22:17:00.000Z	datzy1	thevishy	 yes
2009-12-28T22:19:00.000Z	datzy1	thevishy	both
2009-12-28T22:19:00.000Z	datzy1	thevishy	it will happen either way
2009-12-28T22:19:00.000Z	thevishy	datzy1	even before grub ? then I think something problem with hardware ?
2009-12-28T22:20:00.000Z	datzy1	thevishy	I had 8.04 working just fine previously
2009-12-28T22:20:00.000Z	thevishy	datzy1	is there any other OS in it ?
2009-12-28T22:20:00.000Z	datzy1	thevishy	I wiped 8.04 for 9.10
