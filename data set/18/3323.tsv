2009-11-21T23:22:00.000Z	EntityReborn_		Hai. Having fun with getting an Epson All in one NX415 to scan. I can print (using the driver for the NX400, just can't scan)

2009-11-21T23:25:00.000Z	EntityReborn_		Anyone succeed at scanning in karmic?
2009-11-21T23:26:00.000Z	khensthoth	EntityReborn_	Forumers reported getting the scanner and printer working. Perhaps you should try their advice. http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=7947793#post7947793
2009-11-21T23:27:00.000Z	EntityReborn_	khensthoth	no go
2009-11-21T23:28:00.000Z	EntityReborn_	khensthoth	I saw that post too, and its instructions are for a different version, and fail on karmic
2009-11-21T23:29:00.000Z	khensthoth	EntityReborn_	Different version of Ubuntu or different model of printer/scanner?
2009-11-21T23:29:00.000Z	EntityReborn_	khensthoth	version of ubuntu, looks like.
2009-11-21T23:30:00.000Z	EntityReborn_	khensthoth	IE, the /usr/share/cups/model path doesn't exist, and for installing PIPSLite, I get cups-config not installed, etc
2009-11-21T23:33:00.000Z	khensthoth	EntityReborn_	If you are adventurous enough, you could try creating that directory first, i.e., sudo mkdir /usr/share/cups/model as well as installing cups-config by sudo apt-get install cups-config. Then try the instructions again see if it works
2009-11-21T23:33:00.000Z	EntityReborn_	khensthoth	I tried the install thing, apt complained of no package called cups-config
2009-11-21T23:34:00.000Z	khensthoth	EntityReborn_	How about this: sudo apt-get install libcups2-dev
2009-11-21T23:39:00.000Z	EntityReborn_	khensthoth	No package 'imlibgdk' found
2009-11-21T23:39:00.000Z	EntityReborn_	khensthoth	I believe I'm just going to use it on my XP machine. THis is getting nutz
2009-11-21T23:40:00.000Z	khensthoth	EntityReborn_	Sure.
2009-11-21T23:49:00.000Z	khensthoth	EntityReborn_	If you are still trying to install your scanner, try installing two packages first: libimlib2 and libimlib2-dev, then try to install the Image Scan package again.
