2006-10-11T16:55:00.000Z	XenThraL		no I went as root
2006-10-11T16:55:00.000Z	XenThraL		if root can't change it then, well, I'm pretty sure I'm screwed
2006-10-11T16:56:00.000Z	XenThraL		lol
2006-10-11T16:56:00.000Z	XenThraL		I think the fix didn't work rather then me writing it
2006-10-11T16:56:00.000Z	XenThraL		tell it what?
2006-10-11T16:57:00.000Z	XenThraL		yes
2006-10-11T16:57:00.000Z	XenThraL		I have 2 sound cards and their order keeps changing
2006-10-11T16:57:00.000Z	XenThraL		when that happens, it makes the other one the default output one
2006-10-11T16:57:00.000Z	XenThraL		and that sucks for several reasons
2006-10-11T16:57:00.000Z	XenThraL		mainly - I don't get any sound
2006-10-11T16:59:00.000Z	kromel	XenThraL	I believe there is a way you can control the order.  let me see if I can find the link to the proper info.
2006-10-11T05:00:00.000Z	XenThraL	kromel	would appreciate that thanks ;)

2006-10-11T05:02:00.000Z	XenThraL		"please try my solution" one right?
