2009-07-06T17:38:00.000Z	DhavaL_		WARNING: This will destroy all data on any partitions you have removed as well as on the partitions that are going to be formatted.
2009-07-06T17:39:00.000Z	DhavaL_		This is what I get wehn I try to install Ubuntu;
2009-07-06T17:39:00.000Z	DhavaL_		What do I do?
2009-07-06T17:41:00.000Z	DhavaL_		WARNING: This will destroy all data on any partitions you have removed as well as on the partitions that are going to be formatted.
2009-07-06T17:41:00.000Z	DhavaL_		so what can I do?
2009-07-06T17:42:00.000Z	DhavaL_		Can anyone hear me?
2009-07-06T17:42:00.000Z	DhavaL_		I am not trying to edit the partition table exactly
2009-07-06T17:42:00.000Z	vise	DhavaL_	Just do it.. Are you sure you selected the right partition to install? If yes.. do it!
2009-07-06T17:43:00.000Z	vise	DhavaL_	Read it again.. You have not formatted any other partition have you? Then how will you lose data?
2009-07-06T17:45:00.000Z	vise	DhavaL_	That statement does not mean that it will delete data not on your install partition... *paranoia*
2009-07-06T17:51:00.000Z	vise	DhavaL_	No... WUBI does a vfs over disk images
2009-07-06T17:52:00.000Z	vise	DhavaL_	It will treat files of images as filesystems and mount them...
2009-07-06T17:52:00.000Z	vise	DhavaL_	If you are still a paranoid, you might try WUBI install.. It is not slow..
2009-07-06T17:54:00.000Z	vise	DhavaL_	WUBI will keep the whole ubuntu install in a folder in your windows drive..
2009-07-06T17:56:00.000Z	vise	DhavaL_	No.. No grub.. It uses ntldr / bootmgr for Xp/vista to install the ubuntu entry.. No change to anything..
