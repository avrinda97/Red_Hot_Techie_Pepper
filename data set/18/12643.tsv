2006-07-09T15:48:00.000Z	nicolito		Hello, good morning: anybody knows how the superuser in linux can get the list of passwords of the other users???
2006-07-09T15:50:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	nicolito	not possible.
2006-07-09T15:51:00.000Z	nicolito	fyrestrtr	so if the superuser needs to log in as one of the users to install a program, what can he do??
2006-07-09T15:51:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	nicolito	su [nameofuser] 
2006-07-09T15:52:00.000Z	nicolito	fyrestrtr	but it asks you one password, isnt it?
2006-07-09T15:53:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	nicolito	wth are you trying to do? You don't need to crack any passwords. If you are root, you have access to the entire system.
2006-07-09T15:55:00.000Z	nicolito	fyrestrtr	I want to configure a program to access internet of one of the users, but I only know to configure it in GDM (grafical mode)
2006-07-09T15:55:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	nicolito	what program is it?
2006-07-09T15:56:00.000Z	nicolito	fyrestrtr	Gnome Dial
2006-07-09T15:56:00.000Z	nicolito	fyrestrtr	for a dialup connection
2006-07-09T15:56:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	nicolito	settings should be in ~/.gnome2
2006-07-09T15:57:00.000Z	nicolito	fyrestrtr	but I dont know how to configure it using the console
2006-07-09T15:57:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	nicolito	just copy the file from another user's account.
2006-07-09T15:59:00.000Z	nicolito	fyrestrtr	but if I want to enter to an user's Desktop to put a direct access??
2006-07-09T15:59:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	nicolito	not possible without their password.
2006-07-09T16:00:00.000Z	nicolito	fyrestrtr	ok
2006-07-09T16:01:00.000Z	nicolito	fyrestrtr	and there isnt any way to decript the passwords in /etc/passwd??
2006-07-09T16:01:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	nicolito	no
