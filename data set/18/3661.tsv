2011-07-02T19:19:00.000Z	bazhang	kisuke	whats the issue
2011-07-02T19:20:00.000Z	kisuke	bazhang	as of natty, gnome is no longer installed my default, its ubiquity, it might keep it on an upgrade, but wont install it on a new install.
2011-07-02T19:20:00.000Z	bazhang	kisuke	ubiquity is the name of the installer (live mode)
2011-07-02T19:20:00.000Z	kisuke	bazhang	excuse me i mant unity.
2011-07-02T19:21:00.000Z	bazhang	kisuke	if you dont like unity choose classic
2011-07-02T19:23:00.000Z	kisuke	bazhang	dont work if it not there. < has used it in the past, to switch betewenn gnome, KDE and lxde (dont ask)
2011-07-02T19:23:00.000Z	bazhang	kisuke	classic is there in 11.04
2011-07-02T19:24:00.000Z	kisuke	bazhang	not on my machine for some reason, unless ubiquity SNAFUd.
