2005-09-13T09:31:00.000Z	phayze2		does anyone know how to use SSH?
2005-09-13T09:31:00.000Z	crimsun	phayze2	ssh user@host
2005-09-13T09:32:00.000Z	phayze2	crimsun	i'm already on my university's server, i just want to know how to copy my file onto my user account at the university's server
2005-09-13T09:32:00.000Z	crimsun	phayze2	not really, you need to clarify where your file resides
2005-09-13T09:33:00.000Z	crimsun	phayze2	please keep in-channel
2005-09-13T09:36:00.000Z	phayze2	crimsun	i telnetted to heart.cecs.csulb.edu and used SSH to log onto one of the machines called ecs306mac195.  i want to copy a file from my computer, specifically chapter1question1.cc into the home folder of "jguevarr" (my username on the remote machine)..
2005-09-13T09:38:00.000Z	crimsun	phayze2	on your home computer, scp chapter1question1.cc jguevarr@ecs306mac195.cecs.csulb.edu:.
2005-09-13T09:38:00.000Z	crimsun	phayze2	the trailing '.' is important
2005-09-13T09:43:00.000Z	phayze2	crimsun	it says no such file or directory
2005-09-13T09:43:00.000Z	crimsun	phayze2	chapter1question1.cc needs to be in the current directory, or you need to provide the full path to it
2005-09-13T09:47:00.000Z	phayze2	crimsun	i've typed "scp /home/john/chapter1question2.cc jguevarr@ecs306mac195.cecs.csulb.edu:." and it still gives me the same error message
2005-09-13T09:48:00.000Z	crimsun	phayze2	where is chapter1question2.cc?
2005-09-13T09:48:00.000Z	phayze2	crimsun	/home/john/
2005-09-13T09:49:00.000Z	crimsun	phayze2	and I presume you have write perms in your home dir on ecs306mac195?
2005-09-13T09:51:00.000Z	crimsun	phayze2	try specifying ~/. instead of just .
2005-09-13T09:52:00.000Z	phayze2	crimsun	/home/john/chapter1question2.cc: No such file or directory
2005-09-13T09:52:00.000Z	crimsun	phayze2	the error's pretty clear; /home/john/chapter1question2.cc does not exist or you lack read perms for it
2005-09-13T09:57:00.000Z	phayze2	crimsun	thanks though, that was a lot of help
