2008-01-02T04:58:00.000Z	Svish		is it any known issues with using the ubuntu live cd with raid systems? I have burned the ubuntu live cd but all I get when I boot up after that first menu, is a black screen
2008-01-02T04:58:00.000Z	Svish		monitor even turns off...
2008-01-02T04:58:00.000Z	tcpdumpgod	Svish	hardware raid i take it?
2008-01-02T04:58:00.000Z	Svish	tcpdumpgod	yeah. I set it up with a bios utility
2008-01-02T04:59:00.000Z	tcpdumpgod	Svish	you have it in an array in the RAID cards bios?
2008-01-02T04:59:00.000Z	tcpdumpgod	Svish	what kinda array
2008-01-02T05:00:00.000Z	tcpdumpgod	Svish	why raid0 if I may ask.
2008-01-02T05:00:00.000Z	tcpdumpgod	Svish	whats the model number of your RAID card?
2008-01-02T05:01:00.000Z	tcpdumpgod	Svish	not interested in fault tolerance?
2008-01-02T05:01:00.000Z	tcpdumpgod	Svish	dont use software raid unless you HAVE to.
2008-01-02T05:01:00.000Z	Svish	tcpdumpgod	maybe ill make one fault tolerant and one speed, but well see
2008-01-02T05:05:00.000Z	tcpdumpgod	Svish	i'd probably just go with software like zcat said... i've had some serious problems with RAID and GRUB before.
2008-01-02T05:06:00.000Z	tcpdumpgod	Svish	how many drives do you have?
2008-01-02T05:08:00.000Z	Svish	tcpdumpgod	are talking in the hardware thing now, or in ubuntu?
2008-01-02T05:08:00.000Z	tcpdumpgod	Svish	im talking hardware raid.
2008-01-02T05:13:00.000Z	Svish	tcpdumpgod	raid5 has been made. and now ubuntu should be able to use it?
2008-01-02T05:14:00.000Z	tcpdumpgod	Svish	yes.
2008-01-02T05:15:00.000Z	tcpdumpgod	Svish	as long as they're all in one partition.
