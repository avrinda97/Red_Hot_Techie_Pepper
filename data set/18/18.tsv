2004-10-12T08:06:00.000Z	skreet		Anyone notice that no matter how much you change the color of gnome-panel the apps on it are still the same default color?
2004-10-12T08:07:00.000Z	skreet		Since forever too.
2004-10-12T08:07:00.000Z	skreet		I figured after like 300 versions..
2004-10-12T08:07:00.000Z	skreet		"Ohh, 2.8"
2004-10-12T08:07:00.000Z	jdub	skreet	a number of applets do support that
2004-10-12T08:07:00.000Z	jdub	skreet	if you have time, it won't take long to fix the rest
2004-10-12T08:07:00.000Z	skreet	jdub	How?
2004-10-12T08:08:00.000Z	jdub	skreet	you can write patches to fix this, it shouldn't take long
2004-10-12T09:38:00.000Z	jdub	skreet	yes
2005-01-15T12:15:00.000Z	jdub	skreet	ubuntu is configured to use esd by default
2005-01-15T12:15:00.000Z	skreet	jdub	Mine seems to be set up for ALSA
2005-01-15T12:16:00.000Z	jdub	skreet	we use the alsa drivers with the oss emulation layer, and esd on top.
2005-01-15T12:21:00.000Z	jdub	skreet	you're better off using esd
2005-01-15T12:22:00.000Z	skreet	jdub	I cant get my two programs to share sound, and nevyn said there would be latency if i used a wrapper
2005-01-15T12:23:00.000Z	jdub	skreet	you'll be using a wrapper. the latency issue is minor.
2005-01-15T12:25:00.000Z	jdub	skreet	it might be in esound-clients
2005-01-15T12:25:00.000Z	skreet	jdub	i'm not sure how to active this esd wrapper..
2005-01-15T12:27:00.000Z	jdub	skreet	try installing esound-clients (as mentioned above)
