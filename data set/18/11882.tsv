2008-02-19T00:55:00.000Z	cherwin	DARK48	you are being annoying
2008-02-19T00:55:00.000Z	cherwin	DARK48	read up on the manual page of chown and chmod
2008-02-19T00:56:00.000Z	cherwin	DARK48	don't do that chmod 777 is very insecure
2008-02-19T00:57:00.000Z	cherwin	DARK48	if you want to give yourself permission on a directory, create a group and give that group the apropriate permission. And then assign yourself to that group
2008-02-19T00:58:00.000Z	cherwin	DARK48	you have to log out and then login
2008-02-19T01:08:00.000Z	cherwin	DARK48	that's suppose to happen
2008-02-19T01:08:00.000Z	cherwin	DARK48	just keep typing, it will register
2008-02-19T01:10:00.000Z	cherwin	DARK48	you got the command wrong
2008-02-19T01:10:00.000Z	cherwin	DARK48	it's sudo chown owner:group file
2008-02-19T01:13:00.000Z	cherwin	DARK48	just put the file in the directory with sudo, e.g. sudo cp source_file /destination/directory
2008-02-19T01:14:00.000Z	cherwin	DARK48	this is the X,Y problem all over again, read this please http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XY_problem
2008-02-19T01:26:00.000Z	cherwin	DARK48	too bad for you
