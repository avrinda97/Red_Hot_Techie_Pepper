2005-02-20T12:58:00.000Z	lakin		and back up data.
2005-02-20T12:58:00.000Z	lakin		what's array 4?
2005-02-20T13:00:00.000Z	lakin		I had a question I wanted to ask when coming in here, but then Tempura's question caught my eye, and now I can't remember what I wanted to ask.
2005-02-20T13:02:00.000Z	lakin		you un-muted EVERY channel?
2005-02-20T13:02:00.000Z	lakin		(that one always gets me)
2005-02-20T13:02:00.000Z	lakin		yeah, I use alsamixer to make sure.
2005-02-20T13:03:00.000Z	lakin		the other thing that gets me is to make sure that the speakers are correctly plugged in.  (both fully plugged in, and plugged into the right connection)
2005-02-20T13:04:00.000Z	lakin		Oh! my question was about getting a laptop to go to sleep.  With debian my laptop always tried to go to sleep when I closed it.  With hoary it doesn't even attempt it.
2005-02-20T13:05:00.000Z	Dreamer3	lakin	that's because ubuntu is acpi... you were using apm with debian?
2005-02-20T13:05:00.000Z	lakin	Dreamer3	no, I think it was acpi with debian as well ( I rolled my own kernel ). but I'll check into that.
2005-02-20T13:06:00.000Z	Dreamer3	lakin	if you have acpid installed you can configure it to do something when you close the lid without a lot of effort
2005-02-20T13:06:00.000Z	Dreamer3	lakin	i don't really use my laptop like most though so i don't worry about such things
2005-02-20T13:07:00.000Z	lakin	Dreamer3	I'll look into it.
2005-02-20T13:08:00.000Z	lakin		Server running debian, laptop on ubuntu, desktop on ubuntu and macosx laptop for the girlfriend.
2005-02-20T13:09:00.000Z	Dreamer3		anyone have any tips of keeping firefox loaded into memory all the time?
2005-02-20T13:09:00.000Z	lakin	Dreamer3	leave it open?
2005-02-20T13:09:00.000Z	Dreamer3	lakin	well, sometimes i close the last window... need a hidden window or something
2005-02-20T13:10:00.000Z	lakin	Dreamer3	I always have my gmail window open.
