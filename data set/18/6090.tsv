2008-12-14T07:49:00.000Z	WebcamWonder		Guys, where do I throw in a script to ensure that the RTS of my card is set to 2346 on every boot. Right now, it defaults to off. I believe it was in rc.local somewhere. It has completely slipped my mind
2008-12-14T07:50:00.000Z	rww	WebcamWonder	do you mean /etc/rc.local ?
2008-12-14T07:51:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	rww	Yeah. But that is the script exectued on user logout. Do you know the directory in which every script is executed in the given particular order on system startup
2008-12-24T13:48:00.000Z	rww	WebcamWonder	cwillu: pidgin isn't in intrepid-backports
2009-02-10T06:09:00.000Z	rww	WebcamWonder	http://manpages.ubuntu.com/ tends to be useful :)
2009-02-10T06:10:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	rww	By I don't have access, I mean, I am too lazy to open up even the terminal :P
2009-02-10T06:10:00.000Z	rww	WebcamWonder	oh, I see :)
2009-02-14T11:05:00.000Z	rww	WebcamWonder	I think the factoid for it was !clone, but if I remember correctly, the commands in it don't work right.
2009-02-14T11:06:00.000Z	rww	WebcamWonder	I guess you could try them and see. If they don't give you an error, you should be okay.
2009-02-14T11:06:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	rww	Yeah, found them. Lets see if they work or not. Thans
2009-02-14T11:07:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	rww	Yup, doesn't work anymore. Invalid regex
2009-02-14T11:07:00.000Z	rww	WebcamWonder	on which command? The first or the second?
2009-02-14T11:08:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	rww	The first command, but I found a native solution. dpkg --get-selections, achieves exactly the same thing, without parsing
2009-02-14T11:10:00.000Z	rww	WebcamWonder	Awesome :)
2009-02-14T11:10:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	rww	If you have the admin priv., you might want to update it :)
2009-02-14T11:11:00.000Z	rww	WebcamWonder	I don't. There are factoid submission instructions at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UbuntuBots#Using%20Ubottu
2009-02-14T11:12:00.000Z	WebcamWonder	rww	Ahh, cool. I will see if I can do that once I am finished getting Intrepid installed :)
2009-02-24T05:57:00.000Z	rww	WebcamWonder	Intrepid has Ekiga 2, not 3, hence (I assume) him downloading.
