2009-05-30T15:38:00.000Z	Niels_		how can I check if port 5900 is open on my system?
2009-05-30T15:38:00.000Z	Niels_		its quite urgent and I hope that one of you will help
2009-05-30T15:40:00.000Z	fccf	Niels_	netstat -ntap | grep vino
2009-05-30T15:45:00.000Z	fccf	Niels_	relax dude ... port 5900 is usually used to connect to an already running xserver ... which you don't have ... you can however invoke X from ssh and do the same thing
2009-05-30T15:46:00.000Z	Niels_	fccf	I have to connect to the server via vnc ion which KVM is running. nmap tells me that port 5900 is closed. So, I have to open that one somehow
2009-05-30T15:48:00.000Z	Niels_	fccf	have you got an idea, how I can open port 5900?
2009-05-30T15:51:00.000Z	fccf	Niels_	slow down. firstly you will need to learn a few things .. you need to log onto port 5900 of the VM not the local machine ... if you are using NAT ... that should be as simple as accessing the port via the IP address of the VM not the localhost ... does that help
2009-05-30T15:52:00.000Z	Niels_	fccf	okay
2009-05-30T15:54:00.000Z	Niels_	fccf	I have to bridge eth0 to virbr0 haven't I?
2009-05-30T15:56:00.000Z	Niels_	fccf	are you still with me?
2009-05-30T15:56:00.000Z	fccf	Niels_	I am not sure of the exact spects for bridging ... I use nat and havn't had any problems with my vboxes ... again I am using virtualbox but that shouldn't matter
2009-05-30T15:56:00.000Z	Niels_	fccf	can I run in VBox WinServer2008Standard?
2009-05-30T15:57:00.000Z	fccf	Niels_	... you should have NP with Vbox on the windows side ... that should make things easier ... but it won't run a Kernal Virtual Machine
2009-05-30T15:58:00.000Z	Niels_	fccf	will VBox make use of my Nehalems and would it make sense to use for the following idea VBox:
2009-05-30T15:59:00.000Z	fccf	Niels_	... vbox should take advantage of the multicore chips ... vmware might do it better ...  but you would need to run a hypervisor
2009-05-30T16:00:00.000Z	Niels_	fccf	and VBox hasn't got a hypervisor?
2009-05-30T16:00:00.000Z	Niels_	fccf	I'll be back in a few minutes, hope you'll be still there
