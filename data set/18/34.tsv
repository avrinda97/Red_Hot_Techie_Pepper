2012-11-24T23:27:00.000Z	genericus	Wolseinstein	I don't know anything about external harddrives, maybe someone else here does
2012-11-24T23:32:00.000Z	genericus	Wolseinstein	does the drive show up in Nautilus (the file browser)?
2012-11-24T23:33:00.000Z	Wolseinstein	genericus	 how do i see nautilus ?
2012-11-24T23:34:00.000Z	genericus	Wolseinstein	by default it is on the launcher named "Home folder", it has a folder icon

2012-11-24T23:41:00.000Z	genericus	Wolseinstein	Yeah I saw that link. Don't know why you can't see Devices on the left, you are using Ubuntu 12.04 / 12.10 right?
2012-11-24T23:56:00.000Z	Wolseinstein	genericus	YES I use Ubuntu 12.04 / but i boot GNOME desktop with lubuntu
2012-11-24T23:58:00.000Z	genericus	Wolseinstein	Didn't know Lubuntu came with Gnome. Anyway my nautilus looks like this http://i.imgur.com/mtR2C.jpg Does it look like that for you?
