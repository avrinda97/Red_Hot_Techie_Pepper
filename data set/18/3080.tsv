2012-10-30T14:12:00.000Z	tobias_		Kernel driver not installed (rc=-1908)  The VirtualBox Linux kernel driver (vboxdrv) is either not loaded or there is a permission problem with /dev/vboxdrv. Please reinstall the kernel module by executing  '/etc/init.d/vboxdrv setup'  as root. If it is available in your distribution, you should install the DKMS package first. This package keeps track of Linux kernel changes and recompiles the vboxdrv kernel module if necessary.

2012-10-30T14:14:00.000Z	tobias_		how do i get build-essentials/
2012-10-30T14:15:00.000Z	melvincv	tobias_	i remember seeing that error once... see if Virtualbox works now?
2012-10-30T14:16:00.000Z	melvincv	tobias_	yes, please run it with sudo
2012-10-30T14:18:00.000Z	melvincv	tobias_	:) yes, that error happened, but it worked.
2012-10-30T14:19:00.000Z	melvincv	tobias_	read it first, na? Read and try to understand the messages. That's normal.
2012-10-30T14:20:00.000Z	melvincv	tobias_	ok, you may need to enable Secure Virtual Machine in the BIOS. Or Intel VT
2012-10-30T14:24:00.000Z	melvincv	tobias_	you only need to ask for support when there is an issue :) Till then, read what Virtualbox or any other program tells you. Will help you a lot :)

2012-10-30T14:37:00.000Z	melvincv	tobias_	my suggestion is to install the windows emulator WINE and then run the itunes setup for windows. Not guaranteed to work though...
