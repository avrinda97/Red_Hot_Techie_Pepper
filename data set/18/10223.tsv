2007-06-15T12:32:00.000Z	Bassetts		i am trying to connect to my phone via bluetooth by typing   sudo hidd --connect  00:0A:D9:75:56:AA but nothing happens
2007-06-15T12:33:00.000Z	Azul	Bassetts	try installing the bluetooth applet
2007-06-15T12:33:00.000Z	Bassetts	Azul	bluez-utils?
2007-06-15T12:34:00.000Z	Azul	Bassetts	no.. that's utilities.. bluetooth applet is a gui program
2007-06-15T12:36:00.000Z	Azul	Bassetts	it's probably included in bluez-gnome
2007-06-15T12:37:00.000Z	Bassetts	Azul	the laptop cant find the phone but the phone can find the laptop
2007-06-15T12:37:00.000Z	Bassetts	Azul	i try and pair them and connection failes
2007-06-15T12:38:00.000Z	Azul	Bassetts	yeah, it happened to me.. i tried hidd and got it working only once.. but this bluetooth applet did the trick
2007-06-15T12:39:00.000Z	Azul	Bassetts	apt-get install bluez-gnome
2007-06-15T12:39:00.000Z	Bassetts	Azul	ok i configured it from there, no luck
2007-06-15T12:40:00.000Z	Azul	Bassetts	umm, it might be "apt-get installed gnome-bluetooth"
2007-06-15T12:40:00.000Z	Bassetts	Azul	yeh they are both packages
2007-06-15T12:42:00.000Z	Bassetts	Azul	gnome-bluetooth fails when trying to start
2007-06-17T09:58:00.000Z	Azul	Bassetts	mine does too
2007-06-17T09:58:00.000Z	Azul	Bassetts	i think 7.04 and java don't get along
2007-06-17T09:58:00.000Z	Bassetts	Azul	it worked yesterday
2007-06-17T09:59:00.000Z	Azul	Bassetts	mine loads and the main windows shows for about half a second then it just quits itself
2007-06-17T10:00:00.000Z	Azul	Bassetts	i also tried to use a java applet in firefox and the whole thing crashes
