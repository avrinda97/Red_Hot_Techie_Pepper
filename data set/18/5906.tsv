2008-08-07T05:53:00.000Z	godzirra		Can anyone think of a reason why my windows box can't reach my linux box, but my laptop can?
2008-08-07T05:54:00.000Z	qr	godzirra	can't reach as in cant even ping?
2008-08-07T05:55:00.000Z	godzirra	qr	correct.  Can not ping, ssh, or access the websites via ip.  I'm using putty to connect to 192.168.1.99
2008-08-07T05:56:00.000Z	qr	godzirra	that sounds like a problem with the windows box
2008-08-07T05:57:00.000Z	godzirra	qr	no idea.  It used to work.
2008-08-07T05:58:00.000Z	qr	godzirra	well obviously something has changed, have you installed/uninstalled anything recently (on either machine)?
2008-08-07T05:58:00.000Z	godzirra	qr	I reinstalled ubuntu ;p
2008-08-07T05:59:00.000Z	qr	godzirra	have you tried the other way round? Ie contacting the windows machine from the linux machine?
2008-08-07T05:59:00.000Z	godzirra	qr	nothing I can really do to connect.  DOes windows return pings by default?
2008-08-07T06:00:00.000Z	qr	godzirra	it should
2008-08-07T06:00:00.000Z	godzirra	qr	times out.
2008-08-07T06:00:00.000Z	qr	godzirra	how about the connecting from the laptop that can reach linux to the machine that can't, does that work?
2008-08-07T06:01:00.000Z	godzirra	qr	 the laptop can't reach the windows machine either.
2008-08-07T06:01:00.000Z	qr	godzirra	that's definitely a problem with the windows machine then
2008-08-07T06:04:00.000Z	qr	godzirra	have you tried turning off the firewall entirely?
2008-08-07T06:04:00.000Z	godzirra	qr	not yet.
2008-08-07T06:05:00.000Z	qr	godzirra	well try that, you'll at least find out if it's a firewall issue or not before you beat your head against firewall settings trying to make it work
2008-08-07T06:05:00.000Z	godzirra	qr	I just did.  It still times out.
