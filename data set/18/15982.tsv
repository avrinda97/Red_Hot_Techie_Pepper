2005-02-25T12:19:00.000Z	jelte		hiya.... anyone know why it would take my cdrom an estimated 50 min to copy 400mb off a cd on to my hd ?   (its an ide LITE-ON LTR-40125W   40x12x48)
2005-02-25T12:21:00.000Z	krism	jelte	: no options, just 'hdparm /device'
2005-02-25T12:23:00.000Z	jelte	krism	LinuxJones yep, i'm using /dev/hdc   and dma is on, so is unmaskirq and 32 bit support
2005-02-25T12:24:00.000Z	krism	jelte	: does it happen with every cd, or just one?
2005-02-25T12:24:00.000Z	krism	jelte	: that will slow it down, but im wondering if it's just a dirty cd / laser, etc.
2005-02-25T12:25:00.000Z	jelte	krism	could be...  it was so slow yesterday, i couldn't even successfully boot up knoppix from it!
2005-02-25T12:25:00.000Z	krism	jelte	: yikes man :) try cleaning it
2005-02-25T12:26:00.000Z	krism	jelte	: rofl sheesh ;)
2005-02-25T12:27:00.000Z	jelte	krism	odd thing was that when i did an hdparm -t on the knoppix cd it gave i/o errors, but other cd's were fine....
2005-02-25T12:28:00.000Z	krism	jelte	: hmm.. i  wonder if the drive itself is going bad?
2005-02-25T12:28:00.000Z	jelte	krism	yeah thats kinda what i was thinking too... no way a bit of dust gives this odd behaviour
2005-02-25T12:29:00.000Z	krism	jelte	: ;)
2005-02-25T12:29:00.000Z	krism	jelte	: im tempted to buy one, but im nervous about PPC linux - wondering if ill have a lot of trouble getting random packages to compile.
2005-02-25T12:30:00.000Z	jelte	krism	yeah not too sure about that either... thinking of buying one and sticking with Mac OS for a bit to see what its like... but too afraid they'll come out with the G5 some point this year... not sure if i can wait though... dillemas dillemas... ;-)
2005-02-25T12:31:00.000Z	krism	jelte	: eh, no real interest for me in osx. maybe ill get an older desktop mac and try ubuntu ppc on that first ;)
2005-02-25T12:32:00.000Z	krism	jelte	(e.g. before plopping 2k on a powerbook)
2005-02-25T12:32:00.000Z	jelte	krism	let us know how you get on ;-)
2005-02-25T12:32:00.000Z	krism	jelte	sure
