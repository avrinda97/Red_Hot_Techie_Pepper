2008-08-29T18:56:00.000Z	nnull		anyone know how id go about making hidden/backup files 50% transparent in nautilus?
2008-08-29T18:56:00.000Z	nnull		or with another stable file manager?
2008-08-29T18:56:00.000Z	jrib	nnull	I imagine you'd have to hack on nautilus a bit
2008-08-29T18:57:00.000Z	nnull	jrib	make a script or?
2008-08-29T18:57:00.000Z	jrib	nnull	program
2008-08-29T18:59:00.000Z	nnull	jrib	even using ls it uses the color blue to show hidden folders/files can i change the color of hidden folders in nautils? this would be sufficient just need a way to quickly distinguish if the file is hidden or not
2008-08-29T19:00:00.000Z	jrib	nnull	not that I know of, no
2008-09-11T18:18:00.000Z	nnull	jrib	it says allow tcp/port but what about if u want to change outbound traffic..
2008-09-11T18:18:00.000Z	jrib	nnull	what?
2008-09-11T18:19:00.000Z	nnull	jrib	^^
2008-09-26T18:57:00.000Z	jrib	nnull	just install netbeans from the repositories using your favorite package manager
2008-09-26T18:58:00.000Z	jrib	nnull	right, that's what happens when you install things outside of the repositories
2008-09-26T18:59:00.000Z	jrib	nnull	you just said you have the java sdk and synaptic isn't recognizing it
2008-10-09T17:52:00.000Z	jrib	nnull	"might".  Your second step is to check permissions in your HOME
2008-12-03T17:24:00.000Z	jrib	nnull	on intrepid?
2008-12-03T17:27:00.000Z	jrib	nnull	but that's old advice, so you probably should check with #compiz-fusion first
2009-01-18T18:54:00.000Z	nnull	jrib	any idea dude?
2009-01-18T18:55:00.000Z	jrib	nnull	nope
