2008-07-13T05:23:00.000Z	micky		does a domain name ex ( test.com ) that has nameservers ns1.test.org / ns2.test.org need it`s own nameservers ex ( ns1.test.com / ns2.test.com ) defined in order to be ok ?
2008-07-13T05:24:00.000Z	Seveas	micky	no
2008-07-13T05:25:00.000Z	micky	Seveas	i've ran a dns report and it seems to report that my nameservers are nonexistent..  :)
2008-07-13T05:25:00.000Z	Seveas	micky	what's your domain?
2008-07-13T05:25:00.000Z	micky	Seveas	danielursu.ro
2008-07-13T05:26:00.000Z	Seveas	micky	dns is fine for that domain ns1.nowlive.ro and ns2.nowlive.ro resolve
2008-07-13T05:26:00.000Z	micky	Seveas	argh i think i found the issue there.. seems i forgot i've set the domain up as having ns1 based on itself ( ns1.domain )
2008-07-13T05:27:00.000Z	Seveas	micky	you don't need ns1.danielursu.ro :)
2008-07-13T05:27:00.000Z	micky	Seveas	i know but i'll need to change that to match ns1 / ns2 .nowlive.ro to be ok
2008-07-13T05:28:00.000Z	Seveas	micky	neh, that's not needed at all
2008-07-13T05:28:00.000Z	Seveas	micky	nowhere in the registries does it say that ns1.danielursu.ro is the nameserver for danielursu.ro
2008-07-13T05:28:00.000Z	micky	Seveas	( Name Server: ns1.danielursu.ro )
2008-07-13T05:29:00.000Z	micky	Seveas	at least that`s what i get by issuing a whois danielursu.ro
2008-07-13T05:29:00.000Z	Seveas	micky	the whois records don't matter when it comes to dns
2008-07-13T05:30:00.000Z	micky	Seveas	yep that`s true.. that`s the way i've configured them... but if whois records dont matter how come the domain knows that ns1/ns2.nowlive.ro are authoritive.. even thou they are not specified anywhere :)
2008-07-13T05:31:00.000Z	Seveas	micky	the .ro authoritative nameserver knows that.
2008-07-13T05:31:00.000Z	micky	Seveas	probaby i've entered the ip of ( ns1.nowlive.ro ) when i registered the domain.. hmm cant really remember thou :) anyway, thanks for the help
2008-07-13T05:32:00.000Z	Seveas	micky	your registrar registers the domain with the .ro nameservers for you
