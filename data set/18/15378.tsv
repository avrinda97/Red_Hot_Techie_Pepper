2006-08-16T10:01:00.000Z	delire		i've just installed Dapper on a system with an RTL8139C/C+ ethernet card, and it hasn't been detected on install. running lspci shows that the card is seen but i have no eth0, even despite ensuring the 8139 and 8139too drivers are loaded. does anyone have information about this card on Ubuntu?
2006-08-16T10:02:00.000Z	synic	delire	is that the gigabit?
2006-08-16T10:02:00.000Z	delire	synic	no it's not.
2006-08-16T10:02:00.000Z	synic	delire	you don't see it if you do ifconfig -a ?
2006-08-16T10:04:00.000Z	delire	synic	right, what did you do to modprobe.conf?
2006-08-16T10:05:00.000Z	synic	delire	I've never had to do anything with rtl8139 - they have always just worked out of the box
2006-08-16T10:05:00.000Z	synic	delire	dmesg | grep 8139
2006-08-16T10:06:00.000Z	delire	synic	yes it's there and detected, i can't get to the machine right now to give you specific dmesg output.
2006-08-16T10:06:00.000Z	synic	delire	just trying to see if it loaded more than one module to try to support it.  That would 'cause you problems.
2006-08-16T10:06:00.000Z	delire	synic	yes both the 8139cp and 8139too are loaded..
2006-08-16T10:07:00.000Z	delire	synic	on Debian the rtl8139 uses 8139too
2006-08-16T10:07:00.000Z	synic	delire	you could try blacklisting one or the other.  Try blacklisting 8139cp first.
2006-08-16T10:07:00.000Z	delire	synic	ok, will do. where is the blacklisting done in Ubuntu?
2006-08-16T10:08:00.000Z	synic	delire	/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist
2006-08-16T10:08:00.000Z	delire	synic	ah same as Debian. good..
2006-08-16T10:16:00.000Z	delire	synic	i got to the machine. grepping the dmesg output on inserting the 8139too module i get "probe of 0000:00:0a.0 failed with error 16"
2006-08-16T10:17:00.000Z	delire	synic	trying the with 8139cp module, i get the error pci dev [...]  is not an 8139C+ compatible chip
2006-08-16T10:18:00.000Z	delire	synic	lspci gives the card as "8139/8139C/8139C+ (rev 10)"
