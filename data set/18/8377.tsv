2007-10-26T13:02:00.000Z	rainrunner87		So, does anyone have any guesses about why my dell is giving me a completely black screen when I first boot my new xubuntu gutsy installation?  Goes black right after grub.
2007-10-26T13:04:00.000Z	warbler	rainrunner87	try this - http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=580929
2007-10-26T13:11:00.000Z	rainrunner87	warbler	xorg.conf only has those three lines, but it's using generic rather than the ATI drivers
2007-10-26T13:13:00.000Z	warbler	rainrunner87	then you need to run " sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg " and select the ati driver
2007-10-26T13:13:00.000Z	rainrunner87	warbler	Thanks, reconfig'ing now.
2007-10-26T13:18:00.000Z	rainrunner87	warbler	have a guess as to whether a standard american dell laptop keyboard would be a pc101 or pc104?  I'm thinking 104 for the presence of the windows key.
2007-10-26T13:19:00.000Z	warbler	rainrunner87	it should give an option already on the line - but go for 104
2007-10-26T13:20:00.000Z	rainrunner87	warbler	It listed 105, which is why I questioned it.  105 was specified to be good for Europeans, and mentioned having keys for "< >"
2007-10-26T13:21:00.000Z	warbler	rainrunner87	short of counting the keys don't know what else to say...
2007-10-26T13:22:00.000Z	rainrunner87	warbler	Eh, this should work.  Thanks.
2007-10-26T13:23:00.000Z	warbler	rainrunner87	best of luck
2007-10-26T13:24:00.000Z	rainrunner87	warbler	reconfig finished, still black.  Trying the link you suggested again, to see if the extra lines showed up.
2007-10-26T13:26:00.000Z	rainrunner87	warbler	still black.  I'm officially confused.  Any other suggestions for my dive into the world of googling?
2007-10-26T13:28:00.000Z	warbler	rainrunner87	there is a generic driver - vesa - dpkg-reconfigure again and select that as the driver
2007-10-26T13:28:00.000Z	rainrunner87	warbler	that's what was selected before.
2007-10-26T13:29:00.000Z	warbler	rainrunner87	then try google - us dell and ubuntu gutsy
2007-10-26T13:29:00.000Z	rainrunner87	warbler	Kay, thanks for the tips
2007-10-26T13:30:00.000Z	warbler	rainrunner87	best of luck
