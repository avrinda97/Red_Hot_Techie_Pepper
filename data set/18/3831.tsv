2010-05-11T00:57:00.000Z	maco	JenniferB	should be ctrl+alt+f1 but if thats not working,then try f2
2010-05-11T00:57:00.000Z	maco	JenniferB	ps: you may be interested in #ubuntu-women, where we don't act all amazed at erm...seeing people like us ;-)
2010-05-22T21:30:00.000Z	maco	JenniferB	repeating too often is how you kept being disconnected ;-)
2010-05-22T21:30:00.000Z	JenniferB	maco	repeating what ?
2010-05-22T21:30:00.000Z	maco	JenniferB	your question, in multiple channels. and like how you just said it twice in 15 seconds in here
2010-05-22T21:31:00.000Z	maco	JenniferB	there's a bot that disconnects you if you ask the same thing in a bunch of channels at once
2010-05-22T21:31:00.000Z	maco	JenniferB	because it thinks its spam
2010-05-22T21:31:00.000Z	maco	JenniferB	but anyway, crimsun in #ubuntu-women says you shouldnt need to reinstall anything
2010-05-22T21:31:00.000Z	maco	JenniferB	and umm are you using ubuntu or kubuntu?
2010-05-22T21:34:00.000Z	maco	JenniferB	if youre on kubuntu check what priorities you have set for audio in systemsettings -> multimedia
2010-05-22T21:34:00.000Z	maco	JenniferB	im heading off to lunch now, but crimsun should be able to help in the other channel i think
