2012-09-15T02:21:00.000Z	Sh0rtWave		Hi all
2012-09-15T02:21:00.000Z	Sh0rtWave		quick question
2012-09-15T02:22:00.000Z	Sh0rtWave		What's the simplest way to disable the very annoying "you must authenticate to install software" prompt?
2012-09-15T02:22:00.000Z	Sh0rtWave		IOW, I don't want it to ask me about installing software. Anywhere.
2012-09-15T02:22:00.000Z	Sh0rtWave		not in X. Not in the terminal.
2012-09-15T02:23:00.000Z	shihan	Sh0rtWave	you do realise your heading into "bad security" territory right
2012-09-15T02:24:00.000Z	shihan		there is a way to disable it, just wanna make sure you understand what your asking :)
2012-09-15T02:24:00.000Z	Sh0rtWave	shihan	I know, and I don't care.
2012-09-15T02:25:00.000Z	Sh0rtWave	shihan	I just want it disabled, because it annoys the life out of me. I know how to fix the terminal...I just need to know how to get that annoying "you must authenticate" window to get out of my face.
2012-09-15T02:25:00.000Z	shihan	Sh0rtWave	k, basically follow this: http://my.opera.com/Viperstryker/blog/how-to-disable-sudo-password-prompts-on-ubuntu and you shall never be bothered again :)
2012-09-15T02:27:00.000Z	Sh0rtWave	shihan	Thank you for a clear, and non-condenscending answer.
2012-09-15T02:27:00.000Z	Sh0rtWave		sudoers?
2012-09-15T02:27:00.000Z	Sh0rtWave		That's it?
2012-09-15T02:27:00.000Z	Sh0rtWave		That'll bypass the annoying window?
2012-09-15T02:27:00.000Z	shihan		yep, just tell it never to prompt you and im pretty sure that'll deal with gksudo as well (what installers use)
2012-09-15T02:28:00.000Z	Sh0rtWave		Oh well, life is good then.
2012-09-15T02:28:00.000Z	Sh0rtWave		That's easy
2012-09-15T02:28:00.000Z	shihan	Sh0rtWave	yes, as stated - its a highly unrecommended path
