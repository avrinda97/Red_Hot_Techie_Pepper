2006-11-30T11:33:00.000Z	wy		How can I change a launcher using gksu as sudo? used the line "gksu /usr/bin/myprog" but it doesn't do sudo
2006-11-30T11:34:00.000Z	thoreauputic	wy	gksudo
2006-11-30T11:34:00.000Z	wy	thoreauputic	It doesn't work either
2006-11-30T11:35:00.000Z	thoreauputic	wy	define "doesn't work"
2006-11-30T11:35:00.000Z	wy	thoreauputic	may be that's because it is not a gtk program. It's a Qt program
2006-11-30T11:35:00.000Z	thoreauputic	wy	umm - makes no difference
2006-11-30T11:36:00.000Z	thoreauputic	wy	wht are you actually trying to run?
2006-11-30T11:37:00.000Z	wy	thoreauputic	the ati control panel with ATI driver. It's in the menu but it hasn't permission to change /etc/X11/xorg.conf. So I must sudo it
2006-11-30T11:39:00.000Z	thoreauputic	wy	 try putting the path to the app in quotes - gksudo "/path/to/app"
2006-11-30T11:40:00.000Z	wy	thoreauputic	No it doesn't work. the program just start directly without asking for password
2006-11-30T11:41:00.000Z	thoreauputic	wy	did you use gksudo recently? there's a 15 min timeout IIRC
2006-11-30T11:41:00.000Z	thoreauputic	wy	i.e. it won't ask for a password until the timeout is over
2006-11-30T11:51:00.000Z	thoreauputic	wy	sounds more like you need root environment - hence sudo -i
2006-11-30T11:52:00.000Z	thoreauputic	wy	sudo uses the users environment
2006-11-30T11:52:00.000Z	wy	thoreauputic	Maybe that's why it can't open connection?
2006-11-30T11:52:00.000Z	thoreauputic	wy	I don't know :) Possibly
2006-11-30T12:42:00.000Z	thoreauputic	wy	no
2006-11-30T12:43:00.000Z	wy	thoreauputic	So I'll delete the partition for windows XP and install it in my vmware :-)
