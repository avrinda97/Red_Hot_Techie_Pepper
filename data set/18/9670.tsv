2007-04-16T16:08:00.000Z	tbuss		is it possible to change the permission to 755 on a multiple files at once
2007-04-16T16:08:00.000Z	jrib	tbuss	yes, seperate them by spaces
2007-04-16T16:08:00.000Z	tbuss	jrib	over 100 files
2007-04-16T16:09:00.000Z	jrib	tbuss	so?
2007-04-16T16:10:00.000Z	tbuss	jrib	type out over 100 filenames in the terminal?
2007-04-16T16:10:00.000Z	jrib	tbuss	you can glob them if you want, do you know about globbing?
2007-04-16T16:10:00.000Z	tbuss	jrib	no, but I think that is what I need, you mean group them somehow
2007-04-16T16:13:00.000Z	jrib	tbuss	yes, * means "anything here except a . at the beginning", so for example to get all files, you use "*" and to get all files taht start with "a" you use "a*".  google for globbing, you should get some more details
2007-04-16T16:14:00.000Z	tbuss	jrib	I would like to isolate just the ones I actually needed to change, I've used that option once and actually purged apps I needed :)
2007-04-16T16:14:00.000Z	jrib	tbuss	you use the appropriate glob pattern then
2007-04-16T16:15:00.000Z	tbuss	jrib	something like sudo aptitude purge php5*
2007-04-16T16:15:00.000Z	jrib	tbuss	aren't you chmodding files?
2007-04-16T16:16:00.000Z	tbuss	jrib	yes, just an example of how I used the technique before, wasn't aware of the technical term
2007-04-16T16:16:00.000Z	jrib	tbuss	ah, ok
2007-04-16T16:16:00.000Z	tbuss	jrib	thanks for your help
