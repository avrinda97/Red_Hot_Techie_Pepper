2007-06-02T05:37:00.000Z	dyrne	joseph	you edited /etc/hosts file? make sure 127.0.0.1 localhost whateverisyourhostname   is in there
2007-06-02T05:38:00.000Z	joseph	dyrne	how do I go about doing that?
2007-06-02T05:38:00.000Z	dyrne	joseph	gksu gedit /etc/hosts
2007-06-02T05:38:00.000Z	dyrne	joseph	let me know what the 127.0.0.1 line says
2007-06-02T05:39:00.000Z	joseph	dyrne	its not in there what should I do?
2007-06-02T05:39:00.000Z	dyrne	joseph	add it. check to see what your hostname is first by typing 'hostname' in the terminal
2007-06-02T05:39:00.000Z	dyrne	joseph	thats you problem
2007-06-02T05:40:00.000Z	joseph	dyrne	ok what do I type
2007-06-02T05:40:00.000Z	dyrne	joseph	127.0.0.1     localhost whateverhostname
2007-06-02T05:41:00.000Z	joseph	dyrne	yes I did that I need to know what do I add to the gedit file
2007-06-02T05:42:00.000Z	dyrne	joseph	that line you need to put the 127 line in hosts so it associates localhost and your hostname with the loopback
2007-06-02T05:45:00.000Z	joseph	dyrne	the file looks like this what should it look like?
2007-06-02T05:46:00.000Z	joseph	dyrne	did you get that?
2007-06-02T05:46:00.000Z	dyrne	joseph	im going to pastebin my hosts file on a bsd box to give you an idea
2007-06-02T05:48:00.000Z	joseph	dyrne	link?
2007-06-02T05:49:00.000Z	dyrne	joseph	ah just look here http://www.lockergnome.com/nexus/linux/2004/10/20/using-the-etchosts-file/
2007-06-02T05:51:00.000Z	dyrne	joseph	its very straight forward just do two lines 127.0.0.1 localhost then another 127.0.0.1 hostname
