2011-10-14T16:35:00.000Z	Calinou_		found why, wasn't selecting the right partition!
2011-10-14T16:35:00.000Z	Calinou_		I still can't reformat the main partition on the HDD
2011-10-14T16:36:00.000Z	Calinou_		only a 31 kb partition,
2011-10-14T16:37:00.000Z	Calinou_		so what, phlak_user... can't edit the main (186GB) partition, only a 31kb one. I'm on the right disk this time
2011-10-14T16:38:00.000Z	Calinou_		it's a external, mounted HDD
2011-10-14T16:38:00.000Z	Calinou_		should I unmount it? I don't use it
2011-10-14T16:38:00.000Z	Calinou_		ok
2011-10-14T16:39:00.000Z	Calinou_		yes, bhavesh, me, but not now... installing 11.10
2011-10-14T16:40:00.000Z	Calinou_		formatting the partition to ext4... thanks :)
2011-10-14T16:40:00.000Z	magik_	Calinou_	i think you have to add / wich is the root .. and linux cant works without it ^^
2011-10-14T16:41:00.000Z	magik_	Calinou_	then it should be etx4 / =)
2011-10-14T16:42:00.000Z	magik_	Calinou_	sudo apt-get install gparted
2011-10-14T16:42:00.000Z	magik_	Calinou_	gksudo gparted
2011-10-14T16:43:00.000Z	magik_	Calinou_	and when you finish restart
2011-10-14T16:43:00.000Z	magik_	Calinou_	^^
