2005-07-06T10:10:00.000Z	spikeh		I've managed to get the Live CD of Ubuntu working, but how do I view my files under Windows?
2005-07-06T10:10:00.000Z	spikeh		I'm totally new to Linux
2005-07-06T10:10:00.000Z	spikeh		Sorry, but how would I go about doing so?
2005-07-06T10:11:00.000Z	spikeh		No, this is Ubuntu's live CD
2005-07-06T10:11:00.000Z	spikeh		I want to test that everything works before migrating fully
2005-07-06T10:11:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	spikeh	 go to places->computer and see if you can view hard disk images :)
2005-07-06T10:12:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	spikeh	 it should just show up in there and mount when you browse to it.
2005-07-06T10:12:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	spikeh	 you can read but not write to ntfs though.
2005-07-06T10:13:00.000Z	spikeh	bluefoxicy	I can't view hard disk images, its a Windows partition
2005-07-06T10:13:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	spikeh	 yeah, those, they should be in Places->Computer?
2005-07-06T10:13:00.000Z	spikeh	bluefoxicy	they are not in Places > Computer
2005-07-06T10:14:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	spikeh	 do you have windows programs you need?
2005-07-06T10:14:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	spikeh	 Linux won't run Windows programs; wine is a toy as of yet.
2005-07-06T10:15:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	spikeh	 ah good.  You've done your researhc.
2005-07-06T10:17:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	spikeh	 highlight something, middle click somewhere.
2005-07-06T10:20:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	spikeh	 you need to be root to do that
2005-07-06T10:21:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	spikeh	 sudo bash
2005-07-06T10:25:00.000Z	bluefoxicy	spikeh	 don't remove it at all :p
