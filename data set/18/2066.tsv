2010-10-02T18:05:00.000Z	This_Guy		Well, that's not the hard part.
2010-10-02T18:05:00.000Z	This_Guy		I want scheduled backups, preferrably with encryption
2010-10-02T18:06:00.000Z	This_Guy		Yes, I know. However, I'm thinking offshore backups would be of benefit
2010-10-02T18:06:00.000Z	This_Guy		In the event of a fire or tornado.
2010-10-02T18:07:00.000Z	This_Guy		Or theft
2010-10-02T18:07:00.000Z	This_Guy		:|
2010-10-02T18:07:00.000Z	This_Guy		But isn't file structure lost with online servies?
2010-10-02T18:08:00.000Z	This_Guy		Yeah, true.
2010-10-02T18:08:00.000Z	This_Guy		Hmmm, online services tend to be more pricey.
2010-10-02T18:08:00.000Z	This_Guy		I know, haha.
2010-10-02T18:09:00.000Z	coz_	This_Guy	 there is something named  sbackup for ubuntu but I dont think that is exactly what you want
