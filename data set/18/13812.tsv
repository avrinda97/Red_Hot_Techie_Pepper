2006-01-02T13:09:00.000Z	tonyyarusso		Or tell me any other way of restoring those files.  (locale, rgb.txt, xkb, xserver)
2006-01-02T13:09:00.000Z	brenner	tonyyarusso	sending it to you now
2006-01-02T13:10:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	brenner	Thanks.
2006-01-27T07:42:00.000Z	brenner	tonyyarusso	what if programname doesn't match packagename? ;)
2006-01-27T07:43:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	brenner	Then you try to find out what package it's from?
2006-03-19T07:22:00.000Z	brenner	tonyyarusso	can't the parted utilities do that?
2006-03-19T07:23:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	brenner	Not to my knowledge anyway.  They make some overtures like they're thinking about it, but don't quite pull through.  G anway, maybe QT works?...
2006-03-19T07:23:00.000Z	brenner	tonyyarusso	dunno.  just a stab
2006-03-19T07:24:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	brenner	Wait, maybe it just requires the suggested package, let me check something.
2006-03-19T07:27:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	brenner	That did it.  I just didn't have the extra part because it was suggested and not a dependancy.
2006-03-19T07:28:00.000Z	brenner	tonyyarusso	so qtparted works?
2006-03-19T07:29:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	brenner	Yep; gparted too.
2006-03-24T09:02:00.000Z	brenner	tonyyarusso	:P
2006-03-26T07:29:00.000Z	brenner	tonyyarusso	someone had problems with gparted and used qtparted with success
2006-03-26T07:29:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	brenner	Hmm, okay.
2006-03-26T07:31:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	brenner	QTparted says it's active; what's that mean?  (Unmounted already)
2006-03-26T07:32:00.000Z	brenner	tonyyarusso	no idea.  i'm just passing along the fact that someone had more succes w/ it
2006-03-26T07:32:00.000Z	tonyyarusso	brenner	'k.
