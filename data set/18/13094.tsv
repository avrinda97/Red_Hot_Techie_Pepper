2006-01-20T10:05:00.000Z	s_spiff		antone here tried backing up the downloaded stuff...as in whatever updates you;ve downoaded? if not, how to do it?
2006-01-20T10:07:00.000Z	s_spiff		in case of a fresh install, I don't want to do it all over again
2006-01-20T10:07:00.000Z	s_spiff		whats mondo?
2006-01-20T10:09:00.000Z	s_spiff		so is there a way i can burn them on a cd/dvd?
2006-01-20T10:09:00.000Z	sethk	s_spiff	sure, it can be done.
2006-01-20T10:09:00.000Z	sethk	s_spiff	when you are done doing it, you have yourself a distro
2006-01-20T10:12:00.000Z	sethk	s_spiff	you can certainly do that, but it isn't trivial
2006-10-12T10:45:00.000Z	sethk	s_spiff	you mean you want to assign an additional IP address to a NIC?
2006-10-12T10:45:00.000Z	s_spiff	sethk	yup!
2006-10-12T10:45:00.000Z	sethk	s_spiff	you create an alias.  such as:   ifconfig eth0:1 192.168.123.111 netmask 255.255.255.0
2006-10-12T10:45:00.000Z	sethk	s_spiff	that creates an IP for eth0, in addition to whatever eth0's "real" IP is.
2006-10-12T10:46:00.000Z	s_spiff	sethk	slacktyro thanks. will try
2006-10-12T10:46:00.000Z	s_spiff	sethk	what abt the gateway?
2006-10-12T10:47:00.000Z	sethk	s_spiff	you have a default route to the gateway, it applies to all interfaces.
2006-10-12T10:47:00.000Z	sethk	s_spiff	you don't need a default route for each interface.  If you have two NICs, say, or as here one nic with two IPs, you still only need one default route.
2006-10-12T10:47:00.000Z	s_spiff	sethk	oks.
2006-10-12T10:52:00.000Z	s_spiff	sethk	slacktyro, boink thanks ppl. worked. now having both lan and net. :D
2006-10-12T10:54:00.000Z	s_spiff	sethk	how to delete the interface i just created?
