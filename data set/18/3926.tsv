2010-02-08T06:47:00.000Z	darthanubis	harjot	the difference between the words empty and resume
2010-02-08T06:48:00.000Z	harjot	darthanubis	i was trying to get at what is restored and wat isnt
2010-02-08T06:48:00.000Z	darthanubis	harjot	I think a dictionay would suit you better than this channel
2010-02-08T06:48:00.000Z	harjot	darthanubis	maybe so
2010-02-08T06:49:00.000Z	harjot	darthanubis	but seriously what type of things are saved
2010-02-08T06:50:00.000Z	harjot	darthanubis	any idea?
2010-02-08T06:50:00.000Z	darthanubis	harjot	the things you have running? or intentionally save. I mean, really, what else?
2010-02-08T06:50:00.000Z	harjot	darthanubis	what so if i have firfox open, then its gonna stay open?
2010-02-08T06:50:00.000Z	darthanubis	harjot	hence, resume
2010-02-08T06:51:00.000Z	harjot	darthanubis	ok i was just confused
2010-02-08T06:51:00.000Z	darthanubis	harjot	I understand
2010-02-08T06:51:00.000Z	harjot	darthanubis	thanks for being an alternative to a dictionary
