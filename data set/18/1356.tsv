2011-12-25T05:31:00.000Z	aBound		By the way who told me I should downgrade to 10.10 for Ubuntu?
2011-12-25T05:32:00.000Z	aBound		I might actually try downgrading.
2011-12-25T05:32:00.000Z	aBound		10.04.
2011-12-25T05:32:00.000Z	brightspark	aBound	I can second the recommendation from whoever it was
2011-12-25T05:32:00.000Z	aBound	brightspark	you using it too?
2011-12-25T05:33:00.000Z	brightspark	aBound	yep.  Currently using Maverick.
2011-12-25T05:33:00.000Z	brightspark	aBound	very stable.
2011-12-25T05:34:00.000Z	brightspark	aBound	when support finally goes away for it in April, I'm not sure what I'll do.  I cannot stand Unity or Gnome3, so maybe I'll try xubuntu.
2011-12-25T05:38:00.000Z	brightspark	aBound	honestly Ubuntu is not really toward the stable end of the continuum of distros available.  It's forked from the least stable of Debian's three branches
2011-12-25T05:40:00.000Z	aBound	brightspark	Makes sense to me seeing as Ubuntu seems a bit more bleeding edge.
2011-12-25T05:45:00.000Z	brightspark	aBound	slackware is not deb-based though
2011-12-25T05:46:00.000Z	aBound	brightspark	I know uses its own little pkg manager.
2011-12-25T05:46:00.000Z	aBound	brightspark	I still prefer .deb over .rpm and whatever else exist like pacman.
2011-12-25T05:48:00.000Z	brightspark	aBound	I've never used an rpm distro (except at work & school but nowhere I could actually use the package manager)
2011-12-25T05:51:00.000Z	aBound	brightspark	I gave Fedora  a try and loved it until it caused issues.
2011-12-25T05:51:00.000Z	aBound	brightspark	I could never go back to Windows. :P
2011-12-25T06:13:00.000Z	brightspark	aBound	... I like aptitude myself
2011-12-25T06:16:00.000Z	aBound	brightspark	Last time I used Ubuntu was somewhere since 7.02 I think that's the version it was called.
