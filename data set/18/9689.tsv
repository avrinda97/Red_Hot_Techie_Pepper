2007-04-27T13:20:00.000Z	danshtr		hi all
2007-04-27T13:21:00.000Z	danshtr		I have firefox spelling problem: right clicking on misspelled word won't show suggestions. chatzilla show suggestions . Any suggestions? :)
2007-04-27T13:22:00.000Z	Enselic_	danshtr	hmm, try with #firefox @ irc.freenode.net
2007-04-27T13:22:00.000Z	Enselic_	danshtr	you probably miss dictionary files
2007-04-27T13:22:00.000Z	danshtr	Enselic_	they send me to ubuntu because its not the same version
2007-04-27T13:22:00.000Z	danshtr	Enselic_	chatzilla shows suggestions
2007-04-27T13:22:00.000Z	Enselic_	danshtr	what ff version do you have?
2007-04-27T13:22:00.000Z	danshtr	Enselic_	the one that came with ubuntu
2007-04-27T13:23:00.000Z	danshtr	Enselic_	2.0.0.3
2007-04-27T13:23:00.000Z	Enselic_	danshtr	try sudo apt-get install mozilla-firefox-local-<your-langage>
2007-04-27T13:26:00.000Z	danshtr	Enselic_	the misppeleed word is marked, but i got no suggestions
2007-04-27T13:28:00.000Z	Enselic_	danshtr	if you rightclick, you should have the words at the top
2007-04-27T13:29:00.000Z	danshtr	Enselic_	I know, thats the problem, they are none. but in chatzilla i see suggestions (that's why I can spell "misppelled)
2007-04-27T13:29:00.000Z	Enselic_	danshtr	if you unistallall plugins, does it work then?
2007-04-27T13:29:00.000Z	Enselic_	danshtr	try with a fresh ff as possible. plugins might mess things up
2007-04-27T13:36:00.000Z	danshtr	Enselic_	many thanks! it was mouse gestures to blame :)
2007-04-27T13:37:00.000Z	Enselic_	danshtr	good to hear you sorted it out :)
2007-04-27T13:37:00.000Z	danshtr	Enselic_	i replaced all-in-one gestures to just "mouse gestures ". many thanks again :)
