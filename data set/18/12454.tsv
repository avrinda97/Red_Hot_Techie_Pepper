2007-12-27T15:21:00.000Z	rukus		does ubuntu have tree on the default install ? Just find the root process of firefox and kill that.
2007-12-27T15:21:00.000Z	rukus		or try killall firefox_bin :)
2007-12-27T15:23:00.000Z	rukus		sorry, firefox_bin
2007-12-27T15:23:00.000Z	rukus		or teh manual build and install.
2007-12-27T15:24:00.000Z	livingdaylight	rukus	if i had asked this question at freebsd i would have been told to go rtfm... they're a hostile bunch on the whole... not like here
2007-12-27T15:25:00.000Z	rukus	livingdaylight	I'm on holiday :)
2007-12-27T15:26:00.000Z	livingdaylight	rukus	welcome to la isla bonita :D
2007-12-27T15:26:00.000Z	rukus	livingdaylight	:)
2007-12-27T15:29:00.000Z	livingdaylight	rukus	i think it was just a typo... ^^
2007-12-27T15:31:00.000Z	livingdaylight	rukus	Ubuntu is more than an os... Its a way of life
2007-12-27T15:33:00.000Z	livingdaylight	rukus	i'd use bsd (want to even) if it had something like the ubuntu community around it
2007-12-27T15:33:00.000Z	rukus	livingdaylight	yess, I can imagine that, been doing this for a whil enow.
2007-12-27T15:35:00.000Z	livingdaylight	rukus	i suppose pc-bsd wants some of the Desktop cake too seeing the success and rise of GNU/Linux on the Desktop in recent years. But they're a long ways away still imo
2007-12-27T15:40:00.000Z	rukus	livingdaylight	bsd tends towards minimalist, build what you need, linux tends to bundy everything or as much as possible, just appeals towards different poeple and eviroments.
2007-12-27T15:41:00.000Z	rukus	livingdaylight	you think thats bad, try #sco :)
2007-12-27T15:42:00.000Z	livingdaylight	rukus	well, pc-bsd is aiming towards Desktop not minimalist.. but i'm talking about the environment in the community - insular, and snobbish... opposed to welcoming, friendly and helpful
2007-12-27T15:43:00.000Z	rukus	livingdaylight	I suppose, but linux ppl generate for to many queries to deal with when things are busy and you have a lot on your plate.
2007-12-27T15:46:00.000Z	livingdaylight	rukus	i appreciate the objection that it is tiresome to constantly answer a question that is #3 on FAQ... but it is no reason or justificaiton imo for the attitude imo... that's just a racket then... a justified reason for venting at someone
