2007-10-10T13:48:00.000Z	linenoise		so there's GOT to be a better way to automount usb drives than messing with /etc/rc.d/rc.autofs
2007-10-10T13:48:00.000Z	linenoise		I just want the drive mounted to the same mountpoint every time.  That's it.
2007-10-10T13:49:00.000Z	linenoise		and what the HELL is a UUID?  why the hell do I need to know a 40 bit random string?
2007-10-10T13:50:00.000Z	linenoise		yeah, time to install an OS that doesn't require me to jump through these kinds of hoops
2007-10-10T13:51:00.000Z	linenoise		wtf?  why isn't autofs using blkid to do this shit for me?
2007-10-10T13:53:00.000Z	linenoise		reboot?
2007-10-10T13:53:00.000Z	linenoise		really?
2007-10-10T13:54:00.000Z	linenoise		logging out will not free up the mountpoint
2007-10-10T13:56:00.000Z	yaser	linenoise	lsof doesnt work with fuse
2007-10-10T13:53:00.000Z	linenoise	yaser	lsof /media/mydev
2007-10-10T13:53:00.000Z	linenoise	yaser	kill the thing it's telling you is using that file system
2007-10-10T13:53:00.000Z	yaser	linenoise	i cant kill that process, i need it to keep running
2007-10-10T13:53:00.000Z	linenoise	yaser	then you can't unmount it
2007-10-10T13:54:00.000Z	linenoise	yaser	So, you won't kill the process that is preventing you from unmounting the drive?
2007-10-10T13:54:00.000Z	yaser	linenoise	other important process are using it
2007-10-10T13:55:00.000Z	linenoise	yaser	those processes are hosed anyway if you manage to unmount that filesystem
2007-10-10T13:57:00.000Z	linenoise	yaser	what do you mean lsof doesn't work?
2007-10-10T13:57:00.000Z	linenoise	yaser	nevermind I get it
