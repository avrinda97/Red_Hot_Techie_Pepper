2007-02-03T10:34:00.000Z	kenthomson		Can someone please help me, I am having a samsung syncmaster 940bw widescreen monitor which is capable of 1440x900 as native resolution, but i dont know if it can do it at 60hz 70hz 75hz, but i am having the vxh sync values. here they are V-Synv:56-75 h-Sync:30-81. Please help me as i dont want to set a higher value for frequency which can possibly damage my monitor

2007-02-03T10:36:00.000Z	kenthomson	blind	those horizontal and vertical sync rates that i have given are a result of google, but i dont know what it translates to in terms of a single value as in 7-hz or 75hz, etc
2007-02-03T10:37:00.000Z	blind	kenthomson	your VertRefresh is 56-75 and your HorizSync is 30-81
2007-02-03T10:37:00.000Z	kenthomson	blind	i know that but i want to know how it translates to a specific value as in 60hz or 7-hz or 75hz etc
2007-02-03T10:39:00.000Z	kenthomson	blind	i don't understand what you are trrying to say
2007-02-03T10:39:00.000Z	blind	kenthomson	im saying, open your xorg.conf.. find VertRefresh and HorizSync and replace the values there with the ones you have now.
2007-02-03T10:39:00.000Z	kenthomson	blind	unop pbureau hbaigu: what i am looking for is how the values that i have got for individual vertical and horizontal and sync rates, translate into a single number eg.70hz or 75hz etc?
2007-02-03T10:40:00.000Z	kenthomson	blind	i have done, that but i want to know the safe value what should i set 70hz or 75hz or 85hz or what?
2007-02-03T10:40:00.000Z	kenthomson	blind	i don;t want ubuntu to detect it by itself once i set it in the xorg.conf as it can easiuly ruin my monitor
2007-02-03T10:40:00.000Z	blind	kenthomson	it'll pick it automatically. select the resolution and it should adjust accordingly.
2007-02-03T10:40:00.000Z	kenthomson	blind	is there a way i can manually know the safe value
2007-02-03T10:41:00.000Z	kenthomson	blind	the specs don;t say anythinge xcept giving me individual sync tates
2007-02-03T10:41:00.000Z	blind	kenthomson	but if your monitor takes all those refresh rates, none of them are going to ruin it.
2007-02-03T10:42:00.000Z	kenthomson	blind	SO what is safe for my monitor, can i know it manually 60 ot 65 or 85 hz or what? I don;t want to trust x on that
2007-02-03T10:43:00.000Z	kenthomson	blind	how come any of them are safe? there has gottu be a optimal value and a unsafe value, will i set a value of 100hz too?
2007-02-03T10:43:00.000Z	kenthomson	blind	but i am lookijg for a single value
2007-02-03T10:43:00.000Z	kenthomson	blind	not the individual sunc ratezx for the horizontal and vertical ranges
