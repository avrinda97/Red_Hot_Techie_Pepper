2012-10-12T11:01:00.000Z	ran_	humanonomics	maybe its a driver issue
2012-10-12T11:01:00.000Z	humanonomics	ran_	hmm maybe.
2012-10-12T11:01:00.000Z	humanonomics		guess might need to wait till there is a driver update
2012-10-12T11:02:00.000Z	ran_		you can reinstall the driver
2012-10-12T11:02:00.000Z	humanonomics	ran_	tried that :)
2012-10-12T11:02:00.000Z	humanonomics	ran_	I have even re-installed my ubuntu twice
2012-10-12T11:03:00.000Z	ran_	humanonomics	and reinstalling VLC?
2012-10-12T11:04:00.000Z	humanonomics	ran_	yep done that as well, but the problwem does not seem with vlc, as I have used mplayer, GNOME mplayer as well, same result, guess it has to do something with graphics acceleration
2012-10-12T11:04:00.000Z	ran_	humanonomics	how games are running?
2012-10-12T11:05:00.000Z	humanonomics	ran_	not much of a game fan, haven't tried playing any games.
2012-10-12T11:06:00.000Z	ran_	humanonomics	thats a weird problem.
2012-10-12T11:07:00.000Z	humanonomics	ran_	it sure is :)
2012-10-12T11:08:00.000Z	ran_	humanonomics	the only thing left is to replace the video card, but thats not practical.
2012-10-12T11:09:00.000Z	humanonomics		one thing I noticed though, that when I try to install additional drivers (ATI/AMD propreitary FGLRX graphics driver (post-release updates) through System settings --> Additional Drivers, the update fails
2012-10-12T11:09:00.000Z	humanonomics	ran_	not an issue with graphic card as it is working absolutely fine in windows 7
2012-10-12T11:11:00.000Z	ran_	humanonomics	thats what makes this problem so weird.
2012-10-12T11:22:00.000Z	ran_	humanonomics	when you playing a video, there is nothing else running that needs graphics acceleration?
2012-10-12T12:28:00.000Z	humanonomics	ran_	nopes, only the video
