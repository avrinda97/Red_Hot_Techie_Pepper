2011-06-28T05:15:00.000Z	captainkrtek_		yeah im trying to reinstall all gnome from synaptic
2011-06-28T05:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	captainkrtek_	http://www.ajopaul.com/2011/04/26/ubuntu-11-04-uninstall-gnome3-and-revert-to-gnome-2-x/   I found that but haven't used it
2011-06-28T05:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	captainkrtek_	may help you (I'm guessing you used the gnome3 ppa and want to revert)
2011-06-28T05:17:00.000Z	captainkrtek_	ActionParsnip	I was using that, then halfway through (after the second step) I had a kernel panic, then when I rebooted all I had was a recovery console
2011-06-28T05:18:00.000Z	captainkrtek_	ActionParsnip	I then continued, removed it, and installed gnome panel, but its still not working 100%
2011-06-28T05:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	captainkrtek_	I'd just reinstall. It will give a more stable OS
2011-06-28T05:18:00.000Z	captainkrtek_	ActionParsnip	Im trying to do that :/
2011-06-28T05:19:00.000Z	captainkrtek_	ActionParsnip	sudo apt-get install gnome-panel?
2011-06-28T05:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	captainkrtek_	possibly, depends what the script has done to your packages
