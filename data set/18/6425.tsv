2008-05-12T01:48:00.000Z	doun		hey guise. any idea when recording videos with webcams on Ubuntu will be as easy as Windows?
2008-05-12T01:49:00.000Z	doun		presumably ubuntu users still use YouTube..
2008-05-12T01:49:00.000Z	flexgrip	doun	it is already easy
2008-05-12T01:50:00.000Z	doun	flexgrip	is it easy enough for you to explain in one message? I think not!
2008-05-12T01:50:00.000Z	doun	flexgrip	if it involves passing obscure parameters to something like mplayer then I opine that is not as easy as windows
2008-05-12T01:51:00.000Z	flexgrip	doun	i plugged my moms webcam in and hardy detected it. Slype detected it, and i talked to her within 5 minutes.
2008-05-12T01:51:00.000Z	flexgrip		no terminal involved
2008-05-12T01:51:00.000Z	flexgrip	doun	on my eee, my webcam works fine. No "parameters" or player
2008-05-12T01:52:00.000Z	doun	flexgrip	how do /you/ record videos??
2008-05-12T01:54:00.000Z	flexgrip	doun	When a couple of friends came over and we recorded ourselves playing a song (our band), I just installed one of those video editors from synaptic. I can't remember which one but it was a qt app.
2008-05-12T01:54:00.000Z	flexgrip	doun	clicked record and bam...
2008-05-12T01:55:00.000Z	doun	flexgrip	lies
2008-05-12T01:55:00.000Z	doun	flexgrip	I will look on synaptic for this imaginary program
2008-05-12T01:55:00.000Z	flexgrip		baltazaar: that is a transparency issue, maybe with your card. Try turning the window shadows off.
2008-05-12T01:55:00.000Z	flexgrip	doun	i will look for you
2008-05-12T01:57:00.000Z	flexgrip	doun	wait, have you typed "webcam" into synaptic? Also I think the video editor I used was cinemara or something like that.
2008-05-12T01:57:00.000Z	flexgrip	doun	I see several webcam apps in synaptic.
2008-05-12T01:57:00.000Z	doun	flexgrip	I'll do it. thanks for your time
