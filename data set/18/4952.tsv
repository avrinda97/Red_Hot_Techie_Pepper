2009-01-08T03:06:00.000Z	AnneShirley		Um, do you all know the little "Connect" button?
2009-01-08T03:06:00.000Z	AnneShirley		On the menu bar?
2009-01-08T03:07:00.000Z	AnneShirley		I accidently removed it. How do I get it back?
2009-01-08T03:07:00.000Z	AnneShirley		Does anyone know how to do that?
2009-01-08T03:09:00.000Z	AnneShirley		Excuse me?
2009-01-08T03:09:00.000Z	oCean__	AnneShirley	not sure which connect button, but generally you should be able to add options to the panel by right-clicking on the 'menu-bar'
2009-01-08T03:10:00.000Z	oCean__	AnneShirley	and choose 'add to panel'
2009-01-08T03:10:00.000Z	AnneShirley	oCean__	I know, but that ones not in the menu!
2009-01-08T03:10:00.000Z	AnneShirley		In this list of buttons.
2009-01-08T03:10:00.000Z	oCean__	AnneShirley	which connect button? Connect to...?

2009-01-08T03:11:00.000Z	AnneShirley		Or Ethernet.
2009-01-08T03:12:00.000Z	AnneShirley		I'll be back...
2009-01-08T03:30:00.000Z	AnneShirley		Ok, can someone help me get my network connections button back?
2009-01-08T03:31:00.000Z	oCean__	AnneShirley	it might be the 'notification area' in the dropdown list
2009-01-08T03:31:00.000Z	AnneShirley		oCean: It was. Thank you SO much!
