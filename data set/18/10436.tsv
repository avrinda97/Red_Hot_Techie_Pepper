2007-01-12T13:24:00.000Z	jrib	jamesbrose	only way is to run firefox in wine with shockwave
2007-02-24T07:03:00.000Z	jrib	jamesbrose	chmod
2007-02-24T07:04:00.000Z	jrib	jamesbrose	use find and xargs
2007-02-24T07:05:00.000Z	jrib	jamesbrose	what directory is this btw?
2007-02-24T07:05:00.000Z	jamesbrose	jrib	lots of music files
2007-02-24T07:06:00.000Z	jrib	jamesbrose	do you know how to use find to accomplish this?
2007-02-24T07:06:00.000Z	jamesbrose	jrib	nope :*
2007-02-24T07:06:00.000Z	jrib	jamesbrose	why do you want music files to be executable?
2007-02-24T07:08:00.000Z	jrib	jamesbrose	k, but realize it doesn't really make sense to have music files executable
2007-02-24T07:09:00.000Z	jamesbrose	jrib	for some reason Rythem box won't open them because of some permissions
2007-02-24T07:09:00.000Z	jrib	jamesbrose	does it work now?
2007-02-24T07:09:00.000Z	jamesbrose	jrib	no :( :P
2007-02-24T07:10:00.000Z	jrib	jamesbrose	what is the exact error from rhythmbox?
2007-02-24T07:11:00.000Z	jamesbrose	jrib	everything is working now :) The program needed to be restarted
2007-02-24T07:11:00.000Z	jrib	jamesbrose	oh, ok
2007-02-24T07:12:00.000Z	jrib	jamesbrose	you didn't copy bengoodger word for word right?  He put my name in there by mistake, so you should have updated that
2007-02-24T07:12:00.000Z	jamesbrose	jrib	yeah I know :P
