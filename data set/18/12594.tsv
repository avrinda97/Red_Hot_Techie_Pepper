2011-02-09T15:26:00.000Z	zewb		whats the deal with that
2011-02-09T15:26:00.000Z	zewb		hmm
2011-02-09T15:26:00.000Z	zewb		so like
2011-02-09T15:26:00.000Z	zewb		anyone can have root priviledges?
2011-02-09T15:26:00.000Z	zewb		just by typing sudo?
2011-02-09T15:26:00.000Z	zewb		or does it ask for the root password
2011-02-09T15:26:00.000Z	zewb		ok so when i use sudo
2011-02-09T15:27:00.000Z	zewb		do i put in the root password or my password
2011-02-09T15:27:00.000Z	zewb		ok
2011-02-09T15:27:00.000Z	zewb		well thats kind of weird
2011-02-09T15:27:00.000Z	greppy	zewb	by default it only enables sudo for the user account you create during installation.
2011-02-09T15:27:00.000Z	greppy	zewb	you can give other users sudo access, or access to only restricted commands.
2011-02-09T15:28:00.000Z	greppy	zewb	yes.  you can configure sudo to use another users password, for example I have seen people create the user "janitor" and the password for that account is required to sudo, not the users password, but the user still needs to be specified in /etc/sudoers.
2011-02-09T15:31:00.000Z	greppy	zewb	I don't know of any open security issues in sudo for now, as long as you keep your packages up to date, you should be safe for the most part.
2011-02-09T15:32:00.000Z	greppy	zewb	the linux kernel has had security issues in the past as well, going to remove that too?
2011-02-09T15:33:00.000Z	greppy	zewb	or if any of the vulnerabilities are in the current version?
2011-02-09T15:34:00.000Z	greppy	zewb	better shut off your computer then, because anything, even the linux kernel, could have a security flaw in the future.
2011-02-09T15:36:00.000Z	greppy	zewb	by default, only the user that you create during installation is configured to use sudo, you would have to add other accounts to it for them to be able to use it.
