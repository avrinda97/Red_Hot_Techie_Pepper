2005-10-16T11:32:00.000Z	mcquaid		hello, i've just upgraded to breezy without too many issues. however i use a custom kernel and i'm having some difficulty recompiling it
2005-10-16T11:33:00.000Z	mcquaid		i didn't want to recompile the kern, but nvidia flagged me that gcc4 is in use but my existing kernel was compiled with 3.x
2005-10-16T11:33:00.000Z	mcquaid		so i thought i'd recompile the kern but getting this error with make gconfig:
2005-10-16T11:33:00.000Z	mcquaid		/usr/src/linux-source-2.6.12/scripts/gcc-version.sh: line 11: gcc-3.4: command not found
2005-10-16T11:33:00.000Z	mcquaid		ya i know i don't use those
2005-10-16T11:34:00.000Z	mcquaid		hmm, ignore that i mentioned nvidia, i'm just trying to compile the ubuntu source with make gconfig
2005-10-16T11:34:00.000Z	mcquaid		why am i getting gcc3.4 not found errors
2005-10-16T11:35:00.000Z	nalioth	mcquaid	is it installed?
2005-10-16T11:35:00.000Z	nalioth	mcquaid	it does. install "build-essential" and "gcc-3.4"
2005-10-16T12:58:00.000Z	nalioth	mcquaid	export cc=/usr/bin/gcc-<version>
2005-10-16T12:59:00.000Z	nalioth	mcquaid	maybe the cc should be CC
2005-10-16T12:59:00.000Z	mcquaid	nalioth	before i do that how do i see what it's currently set to?
2005-10-16T12:59:00.000Z	nalioth	mcquaid	type gcc --version
2005-10-18T14:03:00.000Z	nalioth	mcquaid	yes you can install anything you can compile with checkinstall
2005-10-18T14:13:00.000Z	nalioth	mcquaid	you can build from source easily and not cause any trouble with your ubuntu (it's non ubuntu binaries that cause fits)
2005-10-18T14:23:00.000Z	nalioth	mcquaid	build it
2005-12-29T08:33:00.000Z	nalioth	mcquaid	edit your sudoers file
2006-04-06T05:24:00.000Z	nalioth	mcquaid	he doesn't have a gui
