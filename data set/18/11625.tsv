2006-07-03T06:21:00.000Z	ardchoille	TimeForBears	you have an nvidia card?
2006-07-03T06:21:00.000Z	TimeForBears	ardchoille	yes
2006-07-03T06:22:00.000Z	TimeForBears	ardchoille	its a 6600gt, to be precise
2006-07-03T06:22:00.000Z	ardchoille	TimeForBears	did you upgrade the kernel since installing the nvidia drivers?
2006-07-03T06:23:00.000Z	TimeForBears	ardchoille	nvidia-kernel?
2006-07-03T06:23:00.000Z	ardchoille	TimeForBears	never mind, I doubt it's that anyway.. I was just hinking out loud
2006-07-03T06:24:00.000Z	ardchoille	TimeForBears	do you have any other desktop or window managers on that box?
2006-07-03T06:24:00.000Z	TimeForBears	ardchoille	no
2006-07-03T06:25:00.000Z	ardchoille	TimeForBears	yeah, ok. Still this is odd
2006-07-03T06:27:00.000Z	TimeForBears	ardchoille	yes, it's odd.... it's also 1.30 am
2006-07-03T06:27:00.000Z	TimeForBears	ardchoille	so I'm going to give up and install 5.10
2006-07-03T06:28:00.000Z	ardchoille	TimeForBears	a thought: post the problem on ubuntuforums and then get some sleep, just a suggestion :)
2006-07-03T06:28:00.000Z	ardchoille	TimeForBears	don't install 5.10 without trying the forums at least. Never know, someone may have an answer
2006-07-03T06:29:00.000Z	TimeForBears	ardchoille	ok, I'll post it
2006-07-03T06:29:00.000Z	ardchoille	TimeForBears	:)
2006-07-03T06:47:00.000Z	ardchoille	TimeForBears	good job :)
2006-07-03T06:48:00.000Z	TimeForBears	ardchoille	have I left out anything silly?
2006-07-03T06:49:00.000Z	ardchoille	TimeForBears	Looks good to me
