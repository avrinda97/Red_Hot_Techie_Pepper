2005-11-29T08:21:00.000Z	xc_legend		wait i have another question
2005-11-29T08:21:00.000Z	xc_legend		I have downloaded gkrellm skins how do i get into a home .gkrellm file to untar
2005-11-29T08:22:00.000Z	xc_legend		where would a . file be listed
2005-11-29T08:22:00.000Z	thoreauputic	xc_legend	hit ctrl-h to see dot files
2005-11-29T08:22:00.000Z	thoreauputic	xc_legend	in the file manager you can also make dot files visible in the preferences
2005-11-29T08:23:00.000Z	thoreauputic	xc_legend	you might find it's .gkrellm2/Skins or something like that
2005-11-29T08:23:00.000Z	thoreauputic	xc_legend	you don't need to untarttthem either
2005-11-29T08:26:00.000Z	thoreauputic	xc_legend	it's a directory IIRC
2005-11-29T08:27:00.000Z	thoreauputic	xc_legend	 actually i just checked - the dir is .gkrellm2/themes/
2005-11-29T08:31:00.000Z	thoreauputic	xc_legend	if they are individual tarballs you don't need to - gkrellm can read them
2005-11-29T08:32:00.000Z	thoreauputic	xc_legend	OK :)
