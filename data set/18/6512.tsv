2012-03-24T13:59:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	Seveas	well st0n3r is just fine for me
2012-03-24T13:59:00.000Z	Seveas	remoteCTRL	you could always go into #ubuntu-ops
2012-03-24T13:59:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	Seveas	ya, i actually need help ona perfectly legal ubuntu problem, only it is tricky...
2012-03-24T13:59:00.000Z	Seveas	remoteCTRL	oh then just ask
2012-03-24T14:01:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	Seveas	your're the man :)
2012-03-24T14:02:00.000Z	Seveas	remoteCTRL	http://forums.fedoraforum.org/archive/index.php/t-268818.html seems to indicate that a newer bluetooth stack may help. What ubuntu version are you on?
2012-03-24T14:03:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	Seveas	11:10 and yes i read that
2012-03-24T14:04:00.000Z	Seveas	remoteCTRL	if you're feeling brave you could try updating to 12.04 beta. My experience is that it's very stable but no guarantees ofcourse
2012-03-24T14:05:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	Seveas	the thought came to my mind, but as i somewhat also depend professionally on my computer i frankly spoken don't dare yet...
2012-03-24T14:05:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	Seveas	phunny thing about is, it used to work just fine until i reinstalled my kubuntu yesterday...
2012-03-24T14:06:00.000Z	Seveas	remoteCTRL	sensible, very sensible :) (says the man who upgraded his laptop the day before a very important presentation, only to find out openoffice wouldn't run. Thank $deity for livecd's)
2012-03-24T14:08:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	Seveas	mhm or having your boss destroy his distro for the fifth time (no idea how, he wouldnt tell) and wanting from you to recover his data...
2012-03-24T14:09:00.000Z	Seveas	remoteCTRL	fortunately my boss is not that dumb :)
2012-03-24T14:09:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	Seveas	well... he's a university professor, so not precisely dumb... i dunno :D
2012-03-24T14:19:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	Seveas	i unfortunately have to agree with him, i for example cannot stand the unity desktop...
2012-03-24T14:20:00.000Z	Seveas	remoteCTRL	in 12.04 it's usable
2012-03-24T14:20:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	Seveas	made me cry...
