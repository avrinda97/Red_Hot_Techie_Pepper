2011-04-06T01:43:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	meganerd	but it might not work with his audio hardware, as it does not work for my Line6 UX1
2011-04-06T01:43:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	meganerd	Line6's fault
2011-04-06T01:44:00.000Z	meganerd	PresuntoRJ	I am very familiar with the state of audio on Linux :)
2011-04-06T01:44:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	meganerd	my guru !
2011-04-06T01:44:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	meganerd	pls help !
2011-04-06T01:44:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	meganerd	:D
2011-04-06T01:44:00.000Z	meganerd	PresuntoRJ	I did a lot of research before buying my RME9652
2011-04-06T01:45:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	meganerd	I have the Line6, it runs on my Windows and my Mac, but no pinguin
2011-04-06T01:45:00.000Z	meganerd	PresuntoRJ	I can try to help.  Keep in mind I have hardware that works, so I may not be all that useful :)
2011-04-06T01:48:00.000Z	meganerd	PresuntoRJ	I am guessing that you saw this? http://www.ubuntugeek.com/how-to-install-a-line6-guitarport-or-toneport-ux1-or-gx.html
2011-04-06T01:49:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	meganerd	I could get it to playback (output) but the MIC and GUITAR inputs were at the very least very very bad indeed... there is a open driver for their hardware, but not quite good yet, and they say they have not an ounce of interest in Linux "because it would be dificult to mantain" (read - they don't want to open their code to the kernel)
2011-04-06T01:50:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	meganerd	I also have tried to use a low latency kernel, like the UbuntuStudio one... very creepy...
2011-04-06T01:50:00.000Z	PresuntoRJ	meganerd	I think I have to keep my penguins toneless for now
2011-04-06T01:51:00.000Z	meganerd	PresuntoRJ	I know the song and dance.  RME has products that rock (like my 9652) under linux and some that don't work at all.  You get very different messages sometimes from the same company
2011-04-06T01:51:00.000Z	meganerd	PresuntoRJ	Low latency kernels can cause issues with nvidia and fglrx drivers
2011-04-06T01:52:00.000Z	meganerd	PresuntoRJ	I am a fan of the low latency kernels (I usually build my own, no real need to do so anymore, it is more of a lifestyle choice)
2011-04-06T01:55:00.000Z	meganerd	PresuntoRJ	I have one of these for my laptop:  http://www.vantecusa.com/en/product/view_detail/439
