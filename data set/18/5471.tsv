2008-10-18T15:06:00.000Z	GarfIIeld		Hehe, Installed the LAMP pack now. But how to use/start it (can't find it in the apps list).
2008-10-18T15:07:00.000Z	balrog	GarfIIeld	should be something like 'sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 start'   if apache isnt started already...
2008-10-18T15:09:00.000Z	GarfIIeld	balrog	will that start all the apps in the pack or just the apache server.
2008-10-18T15:10:00.000Z	balrog	GarfIIeld	You install the lamp stack in Synaptic or something I take it?  You may also need to restart MySQL as well, but last time I installed the LAMP stack they all were started for me, I just had to config them a bit.
2008-10-18T15:12:00.000Z	GarfIIeld	balrog	Yes, in Synaptic. But can't see anything like a webserver here.
2008-10-18T15:12:00.000Z	balrog	GarfIIeld	goto http://localhost and tell me what you see
2008-10-18T15:14:00.000Z	balrog	GarfIIeld	Apache is running.  Which means PHP probably is as well, and MySQL should be, although I'm not sure how to test it.  The default web root is (I think) /var/www  so you may want to check out the files there.  Be careful with symlinks in that directory as well.
2008-10-18T15:15:00.000Z	GarfIIeld	balrog	ok, so all those apps are auto loaded at startup?
2008-10-18T15:17:00.000Z	balrog	GarfIIeld	I think so.
2008-10-18T15:17:00.000Z	GarfIIeld	balrog	the "it works" html file is in there "var/www". So how to configure it the mysql db and so on? MyPHPAdmin?
2008-10-18T15:18:00.000Z	balrog	GarfIIeld	I use PHPMyAdmin, which is probably what you meant.  Yes, it should be in /var/www
2008-10-18T15:20:00.000Z	GarfIIeld	balrog	yes I did, just forgot the name. But in WAMP PHPMyAdmin was in the pack, what about in the LAMP pack?
2008-10-18T15:22:00.000Z	balrog	GarfIIeld	i think it is.  if its not, its very easy to install with synaptic.
2008-10-18T15:32:00.000Z	GarfIIeld	balrog	How to find out if it's installed or not. It isn't checked as installed in Synaptic.
2008-10-18T15:34:00.000Z	balrog	GarfIIeld	if its not check as installed in synaptic, its not installed.  go ahead and install it through synaptic
2008-10-18T15:35:00.000Z	GarfIIeld	balrog	ok
2008-10-18T15:39:00.000Z	GarfIIeld	balrog	now it's done and I could simple navigate to http://localhost/phpmyadmin/ thx ;)
2008-10-18T15:39:00.000Z	balrog	GarfIIeld	yep.  np.
