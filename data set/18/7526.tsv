2008-04-25T23:38:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	btse	Did the live cd run and install for you
2008-04-25T23:38:00.000Z	btse	Jack_Sparrow	no live cd won't work, boots and then halts
2008-04-25T23:39:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	btse	try this  At start or install press F6 and remove Quiet and Splash from the command line. If it still fails.. Repeat and after removing quiet and splash add noapic acpi=off before the "--"
2008-04-25T23:39:00.000Z	btse	Jack_Sparrow	ok thanks...  brb!
2008-04-25T23:48:00.000Z	btse	Jack_Sparrow	i now get lots of "end_request: I/O error, dev fd0, sector 0" and "Buffer I/O error on device fd0 logical block 0" and then "SQUASHFS error: unable to read inod/cache/whatever/". I think I've been bitten by a known bug.

2008-04-26T00:04:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	btse	I have found hp's and Dells fail quite often unless using a cd bruned slow.  Even if a cd checks ot, you can convert it to iso and reburn the same disk slow, and it will work.. dont ask me why
