2007-12-06T17:03:00.000Z	mohkohn		Does the alternate-installer run dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/sda* when it encrypts your harddrive?
2007-12-06T17:03:00.000Z	mohkohn		It seemed to go too fast when I ran it?
2007-12-06T17:04:00.000Z	mohkohn		selected encrypted root and lvm I mean.
2007-12-06T17:06:00.000Z	mohkohn		about six hours on my laptop
2007-12-06T17:07:00.000Z	kbrooks	mohkohn	by forever, that means a long time
2007-12-06T17:07:00.000Z	mohkohn		Debian takes about 3 hours to do that step so they are definitely doing some randomisation.
2007-12-06T17:07:00.000Z	kbrooks	mohkohn	6 hours is a long time, so ...
2007-12-06T17:08:00.000Z	mohkohn	kbrooks	you young people have such short attention spans! ;)
2007-12-06T17:08:00.000Z	kbrooks	mohkohn	what's an attention span? seriously.
2007-12-06T17:09:00.000Z	mohkohn		with the alternate installer is there an option to choose "expert vga=771" like in debian?
2007-12-06T17:10:00.000Z	kbrooks	mohkohn	can you answer my question?
2007-12-06T17:11:00.000Z	mohkohn		I downloaded gutsy last weekend from Thailand. The md5sums matched but It had corrupt files. Must of been the cd I burned.
2007-12-06T17:11:00.000Z	mohkohn		kbrooks...I am old and senile. I don't have one either!
2007-12-06T17:12:00.000Z	kbrooks	mohkohn	what _is_ an attention span?
2007-12-06T17:13:00.000Z	mohkohn		attention span= the ability to concentrate for a period of time
2007-12-06T17:13:00.000Z	kbrooks	mohkohn	how don't i have that ability? furthermore, how do you even come to saying that
2007-12-06T17:13:00.000Z	mohkohn		I am not serious here. Anyway I will get back on topic.
2007-12-06T17:14:00.000Z	kbrooks	mohkohn	ok
