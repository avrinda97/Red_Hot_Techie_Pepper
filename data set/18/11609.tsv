2006-07-07T06:54:00.000Z	ronocdh		does anyone know how to format a firewire external drive in Ubuntu?
2006-07-07T06:55:00.000Z	Warbo	ronocdh	What is it's device name? /dev/sda or something?
2006-07-07T06:55:00.000Z	ronocdh	Warbo	it's formatted in NTFS right now, so it has a name. FWExternal
2006-07-07T06:56:00.000Z	Warbo	ronocdh	But what is it's device name?
2006-07-07T06:56:00.000Z	ronocdh	Warbo	dunno. if the "name" isn't good enough, how do I find out?
2006-07-07T06:56:00.000Z	Warbo	ronocdh	type "mount" to see
2006-07-07T06:57:00.000Z	ronocdh	Warbo	name is /dev/sda10
2006-07-07T06:58:00.000Z	Warbo	ronocdh	OK, the "sudo mkfs.<type> /dev/sda10" (<type> can be vfat for fat32, ext2, ext3, reiserfs, etc.)
2006-07-07T06:58:00.000Z	Warbo	ronocdh	That will format it to <type>
2006-07-07T07:02:00.000Z	ronocdh	Warbo	which is the most desirable format? and is <type> what it is set to NOW, or what I want it to be set to?
2006-07-07T07:02:00.000Z	ronocdh	Warbo	nevermind, saw your next msg
2006-07-07T07:02:00.000Z	ronocdh	Warbo	but still, which format do you recommend?
2006-07-07T07:02:00.000Z	Warbo	ronocdh	<type> is what you want it to be. ext3 is the general Linux one, vfat lets you read/write it from linux and windows, reiserfs is supposedly a little faster than ext3
2006-07-07T07:02:00.000Z	ronocdh	Warbo	thank you! vfat sounds pretty great... I have another month or two before I purchase enough hard drive space to migrate all my media to Linux format.
2006-07-07T07:02:00.000Z	ronocdh	Warbo	any downsides to vfat?
2006-07-07T07:02:00.000Z	Warbo	ronocdh	vfat can't be more than 128MB apparently. It can also fragment, and doesn't support files bigger than 4GB. Also it has no permission system
2006-07-07T07:02:00.000Z	ronocdh	Warbo	oh dear. ext3 it is, then. thank you for your help!
2006-07-07T07:02:00.000Z	Warbo	ronocdh	np
