2006-07-25T08:06:00.000Z	fuoco		can i install a new kernel in dapper? 2.6.17 ?
2006-07-25T08:06:00.000Z	dyn-afk	fuoco	yes you can
2006-07-25T08:07:00.000Z	dyn-afk		but you'll have to compile the 2.6.17 kernel yourself
2006-07-25T08:07:00.000Z	fuoco	dyn-afk	i can't find how ?
2006-07-25T08:08:00.000Z	dyn-afk	fuoco	the same way as one would do it on debian
2006-07-25T08:08:00.000Z	dyn-afk		and there are tutorials for those
2006-07-25T08:08:00.000Z	dyn-afk		maybe ubotu has one for ubuntu
2006-07-25T08:08:00.000Z	fuoco	dyn-afk	yeah, but i couldn't find anything
2006-07-25T08:08:00.000Z	dyn-afk		I came across one in the ubuntuforums.org yesterday
2006-07-25T08:09:00.000Z	dyn-afk		search the ubuntuforums :)
2006-07-25T08:13:00.000Z	dyn-afk	fuoco	take a look at this: http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=85064
2006-07-25T08:13:00.000Z	fuoco		thx
2006-07-25T08:13:00.000Z	dyn-afk		it's for breezy but it's still the same procedure
2006-07-25T08:14:00.000Z	fuoco	dyn-afk	that's for manually compiling, right  ?
2006-07-25T08:16:00.000Z	dyn-afk		yes fuoco that's for manually compiling, after compiling you create a .deb package and you install the .deb package
2006-07-25T08:16:00.000Z	dyn-afk		the advantage: with the .deb package you can uninstall the kernel :)
2006-07-25T08:17:00.000Z	fuoco	dyn-afk	yeah ok, i see
2006-07-25T08:17:00.000Z	fuoco	dyn-afk	i look if i can still find a ready made image deb
