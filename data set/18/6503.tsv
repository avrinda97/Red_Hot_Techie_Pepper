2008-05-05T06:35:00.000Z	SWN		Anyone here know how to compile a C++ program with gcc?
2008-05-05T06:36:00.000Z	_Andrew	SWN	does it have a ./bootstrap file?
2008-05-05T06:36:00.000Z	SWN	_Andrew	No, no bootstrap file.
2008-05-05T06:37:00.000Z	_Andrew	SWN	does it have a ./makefile ?
2008-05-05T06:38:00.000Z	SWN	_Andrew	No, here is what it has:
2008-05-05T06:38:00.000Z	SWN		CHANGES.snmp++v3  doc_config  QtExample   README.v3  src
2008-05-05T06:38:00.000Z	SWN		consoleExamples   include     readme.txt  snmp_pp
2008-05-05T06:38:00.000Z	_Andrew	SWN	can you give me where you DL from and I can check it out
2008-05-05T06:39:00.000Z	SWN	_Andrew	Thanks, here's where I found it: http://www.agentpp.com/snmp_pp3_x/download_snmp_ppv3/download_snmp_ppv3.html
2008-05-05T06:46:00.000Z	_Andrew	SWN	To compile: qmake && make
2008-05-05T06:46:00.000Z	SWN	_Andrew	Did you have a chance to look at it? Any idea of how to compile it?
2008-05-05T06:46:00.000Z	_Andrew	SWN	in the readme file
2008-05-05T06:47:00.000Z	SWN	_Andrew	I must have totally missed that--sorry--I'll go look again right now. ;)
2008-05-05T06:55:00.000Z	SWN	_Andrew	I see now why I missed it--it wasn't in the main directory's readme file, it was in the "QtExample" directory (I didn't think of looking there). Anyway, sorry about that, but after running qmake && make it returns an error:
2008-05-05T06:55:00.000Z	SWN		/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lsnmp++
2008-05-05T06:55:00.000Z	SWN		Do you happen to know what I should do from here? Thanks for your patience.
2008-05-05T06:57:00.000Z	_Andrew	SWN	I have no idea sorry, I think someone else would be better answering that
2008-05-05T06:58:00.000Z	SWN	_Andrew	OK, no problem, and BTW, how did you know to look in the QtExample directory to find the compiling instructions? That does not seem obvious to me, but I'm not a programmer either. :)
