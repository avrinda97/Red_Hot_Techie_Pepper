2011-01-05T11:02:00.000Z	AgentBlair		hi, for some reason 64-bit version 10.04 of ubuntu won't load any wireless drivers right after install so i can't connect to the internet
2011-01-05T11:02:00.000Z	AgentBlair		this wasnt an issue with 32-bit
2011-01-05T11:02:00.000Z	AgentBlair		u kno
2011-01-05T11:02:00.000Z	AgentBlair		i was thinking just that
2011-01-05T11:02:00.000Z	AgentBlair		but i can't get to it at the moment
2011-01-05T11:03:00.000Z	KM0201	AgentBlair	whats your wireless device?
2011-01-05T11:05:00.000Z	KM0201	AgentBlair	you probably need b43 for that device would be my guess
2011-01-05T11:06:00.000Z	KM0201	AgentBlair	10.xx, you can probably install the STA driver if you follow the instructin son that page(w/o internet access)
2011-01-05T11:06:00.000Z	KM0201	AgentBlair	u still have the 64bit live cd?
2011-01-05T11:07:00.000Z	KM0201	AgentBlair	well there you go.. :)
2011-01-05T11:09:00.000Z	KM0201	AgentBlair	system/admin/synaptic   click settings/repositories  then on the first tab, check "CD" at the bottom.. close it.. and click reload   you'll get a bunch of errors, but don't worry about it.
2011-01-05T11:10:00.000Z	KM0201	AgentBlair	then use synaptic, and install those packages one at a time in the order they are on the walkthrough there.
2011-01-05T11:13:00.000Z	KM0201	AgentBlair	is the disk mounted?
2011-01-05T11:14:00.000Z	KM0201	AgentBlair	hm. that should work.
2011-01-05T11:15:00.000Z	KM0201	AgentBlair	um, don't think so.
2011-01-06T08:20:00.000Z	KM0201	AgentBlair	NO!
2011-01-06T08:20:00.000Z	KM0201	AgentBlair	do they have no alternative method?.. and why do you need to flash it?
2011-01-06T08:23:00.000Z	KM0201	AgentBlair	are you sure a bios update fixes it?
