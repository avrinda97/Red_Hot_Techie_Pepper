2008-08-07T21:54:00.000Z	slayton	bigjoe4	at the top of /boot/grub/menu.lst is a field that is default then a number... that number corresponds to the entry that will boot by default....   when you scroll to the bottom of menu.lst you will see 3+ menu entires that all loook very similar... select the one you want, count its position starting with 0 and place that number as the default number at the top of the file
2008-08-07T21:55:00.000Z	bigjoe4		﻿slayton: Thanks, I will do that now
2008-08-07T21:55:00.000Z	slayton		ok good lcuk

2008-08-07T21:57:00.000Z	bigjoe4	slayton	it sais "You do not have the necessary permissions to save the file. Please, check that you typed the location correctly and try again."
