2012-02-24T04:20:00.000Z	SmashingX		hello guys when I type in my browser localhost I get it works! but I wonder where that page is allocated so I could install more pages in that directory does anybody know?
2012-02-24T04:22:00.000Z	glen_3b	SmashingX	Have you checked /var/www?
2012-02-24T04:23:00.000Z	SmashingX		that's what Im doing thanks!
2012-02-24T04:24:00.000Z	glen_3b	SmashingX	If not there, try the htdocs subdirectory of your apache installation dir.
2012-02-24T04:25:00.000Z	SmashingX	glen_3b	I wonder what's wrong because Im installign Drupal but I can't see it from localhost
2012-02-24T04:25:00.000Z	SmashingX		I see the it works! page but I can't see the drupal pages
2012-02-24T04:27:00.000Z	glen_3b	SmashingX	you've copied the drupal files to wherever your webpages are (htdocs or /var/www)?
2012-02-24T04:27:00.000Z	SmashingX		yeah, I will find out though, do you know how can I acces phpmyadmin though?
2012-02-24T04:28:00.000Z	glen_3b	SmashingX	generally localhost/phpmyadmin
2012-02-24T04:28:00.000Z	SmashingX		ok

2012-02-24T04:28:00.000Z	SmashingX		probably it's not installed
2012-02-24T04:29:00.000Z	glen_3b	SmashingX	oh... :( try copying the phpmyadmin directory to /var/www or htdocs and trying again
