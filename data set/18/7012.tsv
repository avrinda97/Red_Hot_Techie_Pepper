2009-04-19T07:47:00.000Z	bad_cables		i have an emergency and i need to capture the memory from firefox right now
2009-04-19T07:48:00.000Z	bad_cables		firefox is crashing and i need to recover a wav file it is storing in memory
2009-04-19T07:48:00.000Z	bad_cables		firefox is using 106% of memory
2009-04-19T07:49:00.000Z	bad_cables		well i was using the hobnox audiotool
2009-04-19T07:49:00.000Z	bad_cables		unfortunately, they didnt do a good job of their save function
2009-04-19T07:50:00.000Z	bad_cables		it is supposed to encode to ogg then upload but sometimes it is broken
2009-04-19T07:50:00.000Z	bad_cables		so i was recording it to another laptop
2009-04-19T07:50:00.000Z	bad_cables		but it crashed during playback
2009-04-19T07:52:00.000Z	bad_cables		there's only 25k in /tmp... where else would firefox/flash10 store a huge audio file?
2009-04-19T07:53:00.000Z	bad_cables		where does firefox store its temp files?
2009-04-19T07:54:00.000Z	n8tuser	bad_cables	-> ever looked in ~/.mozilla/
2009-04-19T08:02:00.000Z	n8tuser	bad_cables	-> most likely /tmp
2009-04-19T08:02:00.000Z	bad_cables	n8tuser	there's nothing that big in there
2009-04-19T08:02:00.000Z	bad_cables	n8tuser	25k
2009-04-19T08:02:00.000Z	n8tuser	bad_cables	-> look around there,
2009-04-19T08:04:00.000Z	bad_cables	n8tuser	nothing
2009-04-19T08:06:00.000Z	n8tuser	bad_cables	-> well if not there look somewhere in you ~/.mozilla  or ~/firefox i fyou have this dir
2009-04-19T08:43:00.000Z	n8tuser	bad_cables	-> would that make sense from security standpoint?
