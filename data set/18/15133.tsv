2005-04-30T12:30:00.000Z	digitalwoot		hello all
2005-04-30T12:31:00.000Z	digitalwoot		should I be using 32-bit instead of 64 for the reason that I have an ati card
2005-04-30T12:31:00.000Z	digitalwoot		I cannot get 3d acceleration working for the life of me.. :-\
2005-04-30T12:33:00.000Z	digitalwoot		any one in here happen to be using 64... or more importantly have an ati card..?
2005-04-30T12:33:00.000Z	osh	digitalwoot	I am.
2005-04-30T12:33:00.000Z	digitalwoot		ah
2005-04-30T12:33:00.000Z	osh	digitalwoot	And I'm on a radeon card.
2005-04-30T12:34:00.000Z	osh		What package do I have to get to be able to see my music mpegs (vids) again?
2005-04-30T12:35:00.000Z	digitalwoot		and you've had luck with it eh..? I have amd64 3000 and an ati aiw 9800
2005-04-30T12:35:00.000Z	osh	digitalwoot	Everything seems to work here except sound and video...
2005-04-30T12:36:00.000Z	digitalwoot		you have 3d  accel and a high res - refresh rates..?
2005-04-30T12:36:00.000Z	digitalwoot		did you have to manually edit the xorg.conf file
2005-04-30T12:37:00.000Z	digitalwoot		with the fglrx or whatever in place of ati
2005-04-30T12:37:00.000Z	digitalwoot		and if so do you add a "module" for fglrx....
2005-04-30T12:37:00.000Z	digitalwoot		forgive my noobness lol ;-)
2005-04-30T12:40:00.000Z	osh		My media player sais it can't decode an mpeg stream. That can't be right. Do I need some extra libs or something?
2005-04-30T12:41:00.000Z	osh		totem-xine it is. thanks for the hint.
2005-04-30T12:42:00.000Z	digitalwoot	osh	remember you are 64bit...
