2008-12-15T21:15:00.000Z	pybe		i'm having connectivity issues on a windows domain. I can get out to the net fine, and I can ping hostname and nslookup hostname or hostname.domain.local but I cannot ping or access hostname.domain.local...... any clues?
2008-12-15T21:16:00.000Z	bidossessi	pybe	using a linux client?
2008-12-15T21:16:00.000Z	bidossessi	pybe	using a linux client with a windows dhcp/dns server?
2008-12-15T21:16:00.000Z	pybe	bidossessi	yeah 8.10
2008-12-15T21:18:00.000Z	bidossessi	pybe	i'm assuming that domain.local is hosted on your local server. can you dig domain.local?
2008-12-15T21:18:00.000Z	pybe	bidossessi	yeah ubuntu 8.10 client with server 2003 ad, dhcp, dns. I have other ubuntu boxes working fine but this fresh 8.10 install is just not happy/
2008-12-15T21:19:00.000Z	pybe	bidossessi	yeah dig works
2008-12-15T21:19:00.000Z	bidossessi	pybe	maybe a firewall killing icmp responses from hostname.domain.local?
2008-12-15T21:20:00.000Z	pybe	bidossessi	no firewall. But if I ping hostname I get response listed as hostname.domain.local
2008-12-15T21:21:00.000Z	bidossessi	pybe	try finding out if your machine (client) has the correct fqdn. using "hostname --fqdn"
2008-12-15T21:21:00.000Z	pybe	bidossessi	yeah its correct
2008-12-15T21:21:00.000Z	bidossessi	pybe	no firewall on the client side? what services are you trying to access?
2008-12-15T21:22:00.000Z	pybe	bidossessi	I have checked hosts resolv.conf interfaces firewall
2008-12-15T21:22:00.000Z	bidossessi	pybe	what services are you trying ot access? a samba share?
2008-12-15T21:23:00.000Z	pybe	bidossessi	sharepoint, citrix, and some other stuff that uses domain.local aliases
2008-12-15T21:31:00.000Z	pybe	bidossessi	I have the same settings in 3 boxes and its only this clean 8.10 install thats having issues, is there something thats changed on 8.10 that would not get changed in an upgrade rather than a clean install.
2008-12-15T21:31:00.000Z	bidossessi	pybe	i really can't answer you there, intrepid is still on trial on my machine
2008-12-15T21:32:00.000Z	pybe	bidossessi	cheers anyway
