2010-01-01T17:51:00.000Z	ashley__		hey guys, im having some trouble installing wine
2010-01-01T17:51:00.000Z	ashley__		or rather, installing ies4linux
2010-01-01T17:51:00.000Z	jadakren	ashley__	have you tried using winetricks ?
2010-01-01T17:52:00.000Z	jadakren	ashley__	http://wiki.winehq.org/winetricks
2010-01-01T17:53:00.000Z	jadakren	ashley__	(i haven't bothered installing internet exploerer (i find i get more reliable test results by using windows in a virtual machine))
2010-01-01T17:54:00.000Z	jadakren	ashley__	this page might also be useful for your investigations : http://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=application&iId=25
2010-01-01T17:54:00.000Z	ashley__	jadakren	i'm just trying to install it so i can use Microsoft Reader in wine
2010-01-01T17:55:00.000Z	jadakren	ashley__	are the ebooks only able to be read by that software ?
2010-01-01T17:56:00.000Z	ashley__	jadakren	yes they are .lit files
2010-01-01T17:56:00.000Z	jadakren	ashley__	actually i think there is either a convetor or a reader for lit files in linux
2010-01-01T17:56:00.000Z	ashley__	jadakren	oh ok. i will have a look
2010-01-01T17:58:00.000Z	jadakren	ashley__	apparently open-office can open them too (means you can then save as a pdf )
2010-01-01T17:59:00.000Z	ashley__	jadakren	ah ok, thankyou. i will have a look at using open office if winetricks doesn't help install IE
2010-01-01T17:59:00.000Z	jadakren	ashley__	i imagine there is something unique about the ebooks ( not just text ) maybe images too ?
2010-01-01T18:00:00.000Z	ashley__	jadakren	yes it has cover images
2010-01-01T18:01:00.000Z	jadakren	ashley__	i recommend the convlit package then (i think it extracts those images ) , you also have this thread as a reference : http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=49232
2010-01-01T18:02:00.000Z	ashley__	jadakren	thanks
2010-01-01T18:09:00.000Z	jadakren	ashley__	have a look at the page for ie 5.5 on winehq
