2009-04-24T00:10:00.000Z	zanberdo		is there a CLI alternative to software-properties-gtk?
2009-04-24T00:10:00.000Z	zanberdo		with all the traffic on the main package servers today, I'd like to find the one with the least latency for my location
2009-04-24T00:10:00.000Z	zanberdo		but I don't use the gui
2009-04-24T00:10:00.000Z	zanberdo		for this server.
2009-04-24T00:12:00.000Z	BobCFC	zanberdo	you can edit /etc/apt/sources.list but I don't know how to test apart from trial and error
2009-04-24T00:12:00.000Z	zanberdo	BobCFC	right, I'm aware that I can modify it by hand.  I like the feature that software-properties-gtk offers and other distros support as well when looking for the best possible mirror site.
2009-04-24T00:13:00.000Z	BobCFC	zanberdo	PING! :)
2009-04-24T00:13:00.000Z	zanberdo	BobCFC	not really what I'm looking for BobCFC but thanks anyway
2009-04-24T00:13:00.000Z	BobCFC	zanberdo	there must be a bash script somewhere
2009-04-24T00:15:00.000Z	zanberdo	BobCFC	my thought was that whatever software-properties-gtk is doing with the gui should/could be done from cli.  it should be a simple matter to id known servers, test latency, and update sources.list, but do this from cli (since this is one of the features of software-properties-gtk)
2009-04-24T00:17:00.000Z	BobCFC	zanberdo	here is a script that will test a bunch of wget response times from a list of servers might help http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=4643738&postcount=3
2009-04-24T00:17:00.000Z	zanberdo	BobCFC	thanks, checking it out now
2009-04-24T00:50:00.000Z	zanberdo	BobCFC	thank you for the link to the ffmirror script.  I've adapted it to my needs and have created my own mirror list.  I"m running the test now. this should do the trick
2009-04-24T00:50:00.000Z	BobCFC	zanberdo	wow cool :)
2009-04-24T00:51:00.000Z	BobCFC	zanberdo	i was worried that response time != bandwith but for today it might help anyway
2009-04-24T00:52:00.000Z	zanberdo	BobCFC	yeah, probably not a problem.  I'm just trying to avoid the bottle neck which will be prevalent over the next week... I'm not even upgrading! I just need to install the periodic package on an established server.
2009-04-24T00:53:00.000Z	BobCFC	zanberdo	good luck
2009-04-24T00:53:00.000Z	zanberdo	BobCFC	thanks
