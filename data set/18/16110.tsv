2005-04-06T08:23:00.000Z	andrewski	restrex	add an icon config to your ~/.Xdefaults
2005-04-06T08:23:00.000Z	restrex	andrewski	ok let me see.
2005-04-06T08:23:00.000Z	andrewski	restrex	IIRC the cursor theme is in ubuntu-artwork
2005-04-06T08:24:00.000Z	andrewski	restrex	but i'm not on a Linux box and I don't know the syntax off-hand. :/
2005-04-06T08:32:00.000Z	andrewski	restrex	you catching this?
2005-04-06T08:32:00.000Z	restrex	andrewski	!!
2005-04-06T08:32:00.000Z	andrewski	restrex	right, so you just need to add the line to you .Xdefaults and restart X.
2005-04-06T08:32:00.000Z	andrewski	restrex	h/o a sec
2005-04-06T08:34:00.000Z	restrex	andrewski	I don't have a .Xdefaults
2005-04-06T08:34:00.000Z	andrewski	restrex	Xcursor.theme: Human
2005-04-06T08:34:00.000Z	andrewski	restrex	make the file and put that in it.
