2008-05-24T12:39:00.000Z	cypha		are there any good screenlets or other ways to keep tabs on receiving new emails?
2008-05-24T12:39:00.000Z	Slart	cypha	there's a mailbox watcher thingy for gnome
2008-05-24T12:39:00.000Z	Slart	cypha	mail notification
2008-05-24T12:40:00.000Z	Slart	cypha	I don't know if it does gmail.. but it does regular pop and imap at least
2008-05-24T12:41:00.000Z	Slart	cypha	it's a regular application afaik.. resides in the systray
2008-05-24T12:42:00.000Z	Slart	cypha	yup
2008-05-24T12:42:00.000Z	Slart	cypha	you get a little popup with the header info.. then it launches whatever mail software you want to actually read the mail
2008-05-24T12:43:00.000Z	Slart	cypha	I just checked.. it handles gmail, pop, imap, regular linux mailbox
2008-05-24T12:44:00.000Z	Slart	cypha	sudo apt-get install mail-notification
2008-05-24T12:45:00.000Z	Slart	cypha	I don't know about best.. it works for me.. try it.. if you don't like it, uninstall it
2008-05-24T12:48:00.000Z	Slart	cypha	apt-get remove, removes the program binaries but not configuration files... apt-get remove --purge removes everything, binaries + config. I don't know of a third way. (in synaptic "completely remove"=--purge, "remove"=remove)
2008-05-24T12:53:00.000Z	cypha	Slart	do dependencies = configuration files?
2008-05-24T12:54:00.000Z	Slart	cypha	no.. dependencies are taken care of automagically by apt... if you have something installed that nothing needs it will tell you when you run apt-get install in a terminal
2008-05-24T12:55:00.000Z	Slart	cypha	yes.. it will print something like "The following packages aren't needed anymore.. to remove them run bla bla bla"
2008-05-24T12:57:00.000Z	Slart	cypha	well.. everything is packages in apt.. you install the firefox package, you install the openoffice package.. you install the wine package
2008-05-24T12:57:00.000Z	Slart	cypha	but dependencies in apt just means that one package needs another one to be installed..
2008-05-24T13:31:00.000Z	Slart	cypha	I think they both use the same backend.. they are compatible.. you can install with one and uninstall with the other
2008-05-24T13:31:00.000Z	Slart	cypha	but aptitude has this little nice terminal gui thing going.. some people like that
