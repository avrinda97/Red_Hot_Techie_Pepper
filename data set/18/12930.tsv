2006-02-23T17:55:00.000Z	superbob		Anyone got a mobility 9200 running with DRI?
2006-02-23T17:56:00.000Z	amphi	superbob	that's supported by the xorg radeon driver, assuming you have the kernel modules loaded
2006-02-23T17:57:00.000Z	superbob	amphi	I have managed to get xorg started with dri working
2006-02-23T17:57:00.000Z	superbob	amphi	the problem is my display is corrupted
2006-02-23T17:57:00.000Z	superbob	amphi	I have tried many different resolutions/refresh rates
2006-02-23T17:57:00.000Z	amphi	superbob	do you have page fliping enabled in xorg.conf? that can cause corruption on some cards
2006-02-23T17:58:00.000Z	superbob	amphi	no :(
2006-02-23T17:58:00.000Z	superbob	amphi	the corruption isnt here if i remove xorg.conf and let x sort itself out (obviously dri isnt enabled this way though)
2006-02-23T06:00:00.000Z	amphi	superbob	yeah - you need to fiddle with the radeon options for xorg.conf, described in man radeon, I think
2006-02-23T06:07:00.000Z	superbob	amphi	my problem was resolved by https://launchpad.net/distros/ubuntu/+source/xserver-xorg-driver-ati/+bug/20283
2006-02-23T06:08:00.000Z	amphi	superbob	what did you do?
2006-02-23T06:09:00.000Z	superbob	amphi	I ran that command in the first post, but I have just noticed it has disabled DRI...
2006-02-23T06:09:00.000Z	superbob	amphi	:( its either DRI and unuseablely corrupted screen
2006-02-23T06:12:00.000Z	superbob	amphi	its reverted back to "ati" as opposed to fglrx, which fixes 2d and breaks DRI p
2006-02-23T06:20:00.000Z	superbob	amphi	http://ps-aux.org/paste
2006-02-23T06:21:00.000Z	amphi	superbob	why did you show me that? ;)
2006-02-23T06:21:00.000Z	superbob	amphi	to see if u can shed any light on those errors
2006-02-23T06:22:00.000Z	amphi	superbob	no, sorry, I know nothing about fglrx, except that it is t3h 3vi1 ;)
