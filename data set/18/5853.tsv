2009-12-05T23:05:00.000Z	mav		scalalove: if you want to end a particular process, then you can go to system --> administration --> system monitor and end there
2009-12-05T23:06:00.000Z	mav		scalalove: you get crosshairs in xkill which you can use to end programs for which u see the gui
2009-12-05T23:08:00.000Z	mav		scalalove: if u type xkill, the cursor changes to an X..
2009-12-05T23:09:00.000Z	mav		could someone help me with firefox crashes due to segmentation fault...it crashes when i click addons...browserless here..
2009-12-05T23:09:00.000Z	mav		scalalove: yes it is, wish we had this in windows lol :P
2009-12-05T23:10:00.000Z	mav		scalalove: same here..
2009-12-05T23:12:00.000Z	mav		scalalove: yes, but u can play dumb games in virtualbox
2009-12-05T23:12:00.000Z	mav		scalalove: yes you cannot help that..
2009-12-05T23:14:00.000Z	mav		scalalove: native games on linux work very well, TORCS for example..
2009-12-05T23:16:00.000Z	guntbert	mav	there are very few cases where a reinstall helps
2009-12-05T23:17:00.000Z	mav	guntbert	in this case fsck murdered my filesystem (my HDD's bad)..will it help now?
2009-12-05T23:18:00.000Z	guntbert	mav	fsck doesn't murder file systems - if you HD is bad - back up if possible, then exchange it, then install a new system and restore
2009-12-05T23:19:00.000Z	mav	guntbert	isn't fsck like chkdsk in windows?
2009-12-05T23:19:00.000Z	guntbert	mav	sort of, yes, but if the HD is bad there is nothing it can do
2009-12-05T23:20:00.000Z	mav	guntbert	ohh...i'll try to run the vendor's tool now and see if it helps, else i'll get it replaced..
2009-12-05T23:20:00.000Z	guntbert	mav	Good luck :-)
2009-12-05T23:20:00.000Z	mav	guntbert	thanks..
