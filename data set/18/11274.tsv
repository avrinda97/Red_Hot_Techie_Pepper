2006-08-22T12:02:00.000Z	bhrobinson		can anyone tell me what the deal is with xserver-xorg-core not allowing me to open XServer?
2006-08-22T12:03:00.000Z	bhrobinson		already fixed but downgrading...
2006-08-22T12:03:00.000Z	bhrobinson		I am just wondering how to keep people from trying to install the auto update
2006-08-22T12:04:00.000Z	bhrobinson		thanks...
2006-08-22T12:04:00.000Z	bhrobinson		one more question...
2006-08-22T12:05:00.000Z	bhrobinson		I finally have given up on my video card, but wonder if anyone can help. I have an AGP and a PCI Nvidia 5200 dual head cards
2006-08-22T12:05:00.000Z	bhrobinson		if I try to use those both, GDM will not start.
2006-08-22T12:06:00.000Z	bhrobinson		I finally pulled the AGP and put in an old Matrox 450
2006-08-22T12:06:00.000Z	bhrobinson		any ideas though?
2006-08-22T12:06:00.000Z	ubuntu	bhrobinson	 try kdm ;)
2006-08-22T12:07:00.000Z	ubuntu	bhrobinson	lol, worth a shot , heh
2006-08-22T12:07:00.000Z	bhrobinson	ubuntu	thanks... I will try that. All I need to do is run kdm from the command, right?
2006-08-22T12:07:00.000Z	ubuntu	bhrobinson	 sudo apt-get install kdm
2006-08-22T12:08:00.000Z	bhrobinson	ubuntu	I think I already have it installed, just not the default
2006-08-22T12:08:00.000Z	ubuntu	bhrobinson	then try dpkg-reconfigure gdm
2006-08-22T12:10:00.000Z	ubuntu	bhrobinson	 good luck though, hope it helps
2006-08-22T12:10:00.000Z	bhrobinson	ubuntu	thanks...
