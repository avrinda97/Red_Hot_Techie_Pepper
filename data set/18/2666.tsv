2010-03-23T01:00:00.000Z	over_soul_	Trek	It makes error in make - it says that some of the files are missing, but they are not missing
2010-03-23T01:00:00.000Z	Trek	over_soul_	pastebin the output of the command please?
2010-03-23T01:01:00.000Z	over_soul_	Trek	I'm somewhat new to linux... How to do that?
2010-03-23T01:03:00.000Z	over_soul_	Trek	here's the paste: http://paste.ubuntu.com/399531/
2010-03-23T01:06:00.000Z	Trek	over_soul_	the error is that there's errors in the commands within files, so the files might be corrupt, verify the version of the driver
2010-03-23T01:07:00.000Z	over_soul_	Trek	how to verify that?
2010-03-23T01:07:00.000Z	over_soul_	Trek	About corrupt files... I don't know how can that be - I downloaded them from creative's main site
2010-03-23T01:08:00.000Z	over_soul_	Trek	downloaded them twice....
2010-03-23T01:09:00.000Z	Trek	over_soul_	do the have drivers for Ubuntu, and not just "linux"?
2010-03-23T01:10:00.000Z	over_soul_	Trek	Unfortunately, no.... I checked
2010-03-23T01:13:00.000Z	over_soul_	Trek	I did everything I know so far... followed the read me - it had only type make - that's the first step...
