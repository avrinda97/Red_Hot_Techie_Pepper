2011-06-30T14:32:00.000Z	truepurple		But links made from windows don't work
2011-06-30T14:32:00.000Z	truepurple		Yes, url
2011-06-30T14:33:00.000Z	truepurple		So how do I get linux to use windows url links?
2011-06-30T14:33:00.000Z	truepurple		yeah, thats annoying
2011-06-30T14:34:00.000Z	truepurple		I want to use existing urls
2011-06-30T14:34:00.000Z	truepurple		I saved many a link under windows, I want to just click on them and open a webpage like with windows
2011-06-30T14:35:00.000Z	truepurple		The nature of windows shortcuts are so simple, linux can't manage something that simple? How absurd
2011-06-30T14:36:00.000Z	truepurple		Because its convienant to some users
2011-06-30T14:36:00.000Z	truepurple		I don't know how to do any of that, and that doesn't necessarily make it the better solution
2011-06-30T14:37:00.000Z	truepurple		Why should linux be able to manage web links? Because they are so very simple
2011-06-30T14:38:00.000Z	movan2011	truepurple	 The real question is why would anyone want tens on the same icon with just textual names to differentiate them cluttering their desktop.  I hated windows links back in the day and sure as hell wouldn't want them back in Linux.  Just open your browser and put links in your bookmarks toolbar that's what it's there for.
2011-06-30T14:40:00.000Z	movan2011	truepurple	 I'm guessing yyou don't bother looking for the import options in web browsers then.  Most modern browsers can import bookmarks between them quite efficiently.
2011-06-30T14:45:00.000Z	movan2011	truepurple	 I think you're just trolling.  There's lots of ways you can manage pictures in linux and you don't define how you're viewing them or anything.  You're setting yourself up as flamebait imho.
2011-06-30T14:46:00.000Z	truepurple	movan2011	How very rude, if you can help,then do so, if you can't, stuff it.
2011-06-30T14:46:00.000Z	movan2011	truepurple	 You don't want to accept help except in a view narrow-minded manner so why should people bother?
2011-06-30T14:51:00.000Z	movan2011	truepurple	 If you're using Gnome's viewer go to the View menu and select the Normal size option or hold down the Ctrl key and press 0.
2011-06-30T14:53:00.000Z	truepurple	movan2011	I need it to remember those settings
2011-06-30T14:54:00.000Z	movan2011	truepurple	 As ovhi mentioned it's a general purpose viewer so it won't default to full zoom.  If you want a general picture viewer try installing Gthumb or shotwell which serve the purpose you're looking for.
