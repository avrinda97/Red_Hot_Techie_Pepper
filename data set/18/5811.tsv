2009-05-07T13:35:00.000Z	macvr		hi can any one advice me on what to choose for this notebook config? ubuntu/kubuntu/UNR: Sony VAIO PCG-SRX87 Laptop  * Processor: 850 MHz Mobile Intel Pentium III Processor    * RAM: 256 MB    * RAM Type: SDRAM    * L2 Cache: 512 KB Hard Drive    * Size: 20 GB    * Graphics Card: Intel 815EM graphic    * Graphics RAM: 11 MB
2009-05-07T13:36:00.000Z	Madpilot	macvr	probably UNR for those spec. old machine, or netbook?
2009-05-07T13:37:00.000Z	macvr	Madpilot	but UNR says 384 mb ram required!
2009-05-07T13:37:00.000Z	macvr	Madpilot	its an old notebook
2009-05-07T13:38:00.000Z	Madpilot	macvr	try xubuntu perhaps. you might not be able to run any of the desktop/liveCDs, you might have to install from the alternate (text-based) version
2009-05-07T13:39:00.000Z	macvr	Madpilot	xubuntu. why do i need alternate installer? how do i install on this , when there is no cd drive?
2009-05-07T13:40:00.000Z	macvr	Madpilot	also i'm not able to boot from live usb!
2009-05-07T13:40:00.000Z	Madpilot	macvr	can you change the boot-order bios settings to allow boot from usb?
2009-05-07T13:40:00.000Z	macvr	Madpilot	i tried changing the boot order to removable devices but, its not detecting the usb !
2009-05-07T13:41:00.000Z	macvr	Madpilot	how is a network install done?
2009-05-07T13:41:00.000Z	Madpilot	macvr	I've never tried one myself
2009-05-07T13:42:00.000Z	macvr	Madpilot	ok... i'm new to it but, i have a doubt, if i connect my laptop via an ethernet cable to this netbook ,is that a network install?
2009-05-07T13:43:00.000Z	Madpilot	macvr	my browser is being screwy, can't look stuff up, but have a look around https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation if you haven't already
2009-05-07T13:44:00.000Z	Madpilot	macvr	have fun & good luck. Back in five, got to sort this machine's network connection out...
2009-05-07T13:53:00.000Z	Madpilot	macvr	Windows viruses won't harm a linux OS - but it might, I guess, have screwed up the file you downloaded
2009-05-07T13:56:00.000Z	macvr	Madpilot	KyleK ... no i havent downloaded the alternate cd iso file yet but was asking if it might screw the iso file like it did my live usb files... or any precautions i had to take ... was just checking
2009-05-07T14:08:00.000Z	Madpilot	macvr	any luck on getting your machine to boot from usb?
2009-05-07T14:09:00.000Z	macvr	Madpilot	i'm bustiing my head :(
