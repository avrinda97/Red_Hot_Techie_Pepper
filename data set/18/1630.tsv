2011-01-09T21:57:00.000Z	PsPhaKeR_		I installed Ubuntu 10.10 on one of my old laptops and I cannot connect to a wireless network
2011-01-09T21:58:00.000Z	PsPhaKeR_		It says "device not ready(firmware missing)"
2011-01-09T21:59:00.000Z	acicula	PsPhaKeR_	run updates first and then see if it still lacks drivers
2011-01-09T21:58:00.000Z	acicula	PsPhaKeR_	same for you, did you run ubuntu updates using an ethernet cable?
2011-01-09T21:58:00.000Z	PsPhaKeR_	acicula	no, it just installed
2011-01-09T21:59:00.000Z	PsPhaKeR_	acicula	How can I run these updates?
2011-01-09T22:00:00.000Z	acicula	PsPhaKeR_	plugging in a working network cable should trigger the update mechanism, if not its under Administration -> update manager
2011-01-09T22:00:00.000Z	PsPhaKeR_	acicula	Ok, will try that now
2011-01-09T22:08:00.000Z	PsPhaKeR_	acicula	I kind of lied when I said it was already installed :) and it keeps getting stuck at the installation screen, the loading cursor just keeps spinning
2011-01-09T22:08:00.000Z	acicula	PsPhaKeR_	try the alternate installation disc
2011-01-09T22:08:00.000Z	PsPhaKeR_	acicula	What do you mean by that?
2011-01-09T22:09:00.000Z	acicula	PsPhaKeR_	there is an installation cd/dvd/image called alternate, its a bit more spartan
2011-01-09T22:12:00.000Z	PsPhaKeR_	acicula	I am still a little confused... I can just search and download it?
2011-01-09T22:12:00.000Z	acicula	PsPhaKeR_	same place you got your curent ubuntu installation media yes
2011-01-09T22:13:00.000Z	PsPhaKeR_	acicula	Do you mean the USB method?
2011-01-09T22:29:00.000Z	PsPhaKeR_	acicula	The USB method did not work :(
2011-01-09T22:30:00.000Z	PsPhaKeR_	acicula	The USB method did not work :(
2011-01-09T22:32:00.000Z	PsPhaKeR_	acicula	What you said did not work
