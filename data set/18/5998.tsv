2008-12-21T04:59:00.000Z	peaces		how do I configure wireless in ubuntu?  I believe I have the drivers installed correctly but can't connect to anything
2008-12-21T05:00:00.000Z	Scunizi	peaces	there should be a network icon up by the date/clock. click that.. if you have wpa or web on your router disable that first.  If broadcasting is off turn it on (in the router)
2008-12-21T05:01:00.000Z	peaces	Scunizi	what should i do after i disable that?
2008-12-21T05:02:00.000Z	Scunizi	peaces	after disabling teh wpa/wep?
2008-12-21T05:03:00.000Z	peaces		Sxunizi: Yeah I just disabled that
2008-12-21T05:03:00.000Z	peaces	Scunizi	Yeah I just disabled the wpa
2008-12-21T05:04:00.000Z	Scunizi	peaces	turn on "broadcasting" so the rest of the neighborhood will see your router, including your laptop.. once you've figured out how to connect then you can go back and disable broadcasting and either reestablish wpa/wep or use mac filtering to limit access to your laptop
2008-12-21T05:05:00.000Z	peaces	Scunizi	I have broadcasting on, I don't know even where in ubuntu I would go to be able to see SSID's though
2008-12-21T05:06:00.000Z	Scunizi	peaces	up by the clock in the upper right corner there is an icon that looks like windows networking icon.. 2 computer screens, one in front of the other.
2008-12-21T05:06:00.000Z	peaces	Scunizi	yup nothing in there about wireless though
2008-12-21T05:07:00.000Z	Scunizi	peaces	when you click on it what appears in the drop down box.?
2008-12-21T05:07:00.000Z	peaces	Scunizi	just my wired network connection
2008-12-21T05:08:00.000Z	Scunizi	peaces	have you looked in System > Admin > Hardware drivers to see if there are drivers there that are not activated for your wireless card?
2008-12-21T05:08:00.000Z	peaces	Scunizi	yeah there is one in there that was automatically installed when i started up for the first time
2008-12-21T05:10:00.000Z	Scunizi	peaces	I'm not on a wireless connection right now to look and play, but right mouse clicking on the icon and left clicking on the icon will give you different options. What you're looking for is for an option to switch from ath0 to something else.. (not sure how it'll be labeled..)
2008-12-21T05:11:00.000Z	peaces	Scunizi	I know what you mean, but its not there... I have been playing around with this for hours now
2008-12-21T05:12:00.000Z	peaces	Scunizi	I appreciate you help, my dinner just finished though so I'll try again later thanks again
2008-12-21T05:12:00.000Z	Scunizi	peaces	hopefully someone else will jump in and know the answer.. Unfortunatly I'm stuck.. Have you read ubottu's reference page..?
