2007-05-11T10:39:00.000Z	ed1t		what codecs do i need to play .mp3 song in Banshee?
2007-05-11T10:41:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ed1t	Try opening an mp3 in movie player, it will automatically install the needed codecs
2007-05-24T08:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ed1t	Just double click on a .mov file and Ubuntu should install the needed codecs automatically
2007-05-24T08:01:00.000Z	ed1t	Jordan_U	it didnt install it
2007-05-24T08:03:00.000Z	ed1t	Jordan_U	im trying to play that http://tv-links.co.uk/link.do/1/1/6/26405/41026
2007-05-24T08:05:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ed1t	No wonder it can't play, I am getting a 404 for that video file :)
2007-05-24T08:06:00.000Z	ed1t	Jordan_U	it works for me
2007-05-24T08:06:00.000Z	ed1t	Jordan_U	i mean the link opens
2007-05-24T08:06:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ed1t	Same for me, but the video file itself is just a 404
2007-05-24T08:07:00.000Z	ed1t	Jordan_U	i tried to open .mov file it didnt automatically install plugins
2007-05-24T08:07:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ed1t	Are you running Feisty?
2007-05-24T08:07:00.000Z	ed1t	Jordan_U	it opened in totem
2007-05-24T08:07:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ed1t	Do you have a link to the .mov file?
2007-05-24T08:08:00.000Z	ed1t	Jordan_U	i just downloaded some random .mov file to test it out
2007-05-24T08:08:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ed1t	And did it play?
2007-05-24T08:09:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ed1t	You can install the windows version of quicktime through wine but I havn't found a video so far that totem or vlc can't play
2007-05-24T08:10:00.000Z	ed1t	Jordan_U	maybe i dont have right codecs installed?
2007-05-24T08:10:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ed1t	That's the strange part, it should install the needed codecs automatically when you try to play a movie you don't have codecs for
