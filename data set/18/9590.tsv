2007-03-19T07:13:00.000Z	Oswy		https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromWindows
2007-03-19T07:13:00.000Z	Oswy		The Install Ubuntu title isn't coming up.
2007-03-19T07:14:00.000Z	Oswy		Anyone? Anyone?
2007-03-19T07:14:00.000Z	Oswy		I guess not. ><
2007-03-19T07:15:00.000Z	bruenig	Oswy	I know I did it when I was printing pdfs
2007-03-19T07:15:00.000Z	bruenig	Oswy	when you ctrl p go to the last tab I think
2007-03-20T16:33:00.000Z	bruenig	Oswy	what is your question
2007-03-20T16:33:00.000Z	bruenig	Oswy	if you are doing the manual partition, nothing actually is touched until you hit next or apply
2007-03-20T16:34:00.000Z	bruenig	Oswy	you mean you don't want to touch it at all?
2007-03-20T16:34:00.000Z	bruenig	Oswy	then just don't touch it, after the manual partition party, there is a part where you can set mountpoints and tell it whether you want to format it or not
2007-03-20T16:36:00.000Z	Oswy	bruenig	Thanks. (up there)
2007-03-20T16:37:00.000Z	bruenig	Oswy	you have to set something to mount at /
2007-03-20T16:37:00.000Z	bruenig	Oswy	change the mount point
2007-03-20T16:38:00.000Z	bruenig	Oswy	that leaves everything else untouched
2007-09-14T10:41:00.000Z	bruenig	Oswy	close the gui pacifier and do "sudo apt-get update"
2007-09-14T10:41:00.000Z	Oswy	bruenig	I'll try that, thanks.
2007-09-14T10:42:00.000Z	Oswy	bruenig	Didn't work.
