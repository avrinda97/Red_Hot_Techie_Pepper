2009-05-11T01:31:00.000Z	mzz	hhp2k1	I'd expect doubling the ram to make a noticable difference, if you can find ram that fits
2009-05-11T01:31:00.000Z	hhp2k1	mzz	yeah, 2 512 or 1GB sticks would boost it significantly.  It's the USB1.1 that kills me, lol.
2009-05-11T01:32:00.000Z	mzz	hhp2k1	that's fixable, I think (there are pci cards out there that add usb ports)
2009-05-11T01:32:00.000Z	hhp2k1	mzz	This is true.  I might pick one of those up too ... they're rather cheap, I believe.
2009-05-11T01:33:00.000Z	mzz	hhp2k1	I'd expect them to be, but haven't needed one
2009-05-11T01:33:00.000Z	hhp2k1	mzz	Expectantly :P I don't think there's a single person in here running lower-specced hardware than me
2009-05-11T01:33:00.000Z	hhp2k1	mzz	Though I wouldn't expect to be surprised
2009-05-11T01:34:00.000Z	mzz	hhp2k1	my primary system isn't *that* fast by modern standards either, although faster than yours
2009-05-11T01:34:00.000Z	mzz	hhp2k1	(athlon xp 2600+, 1280MiB of ram, radeon 9600xt for video)
2009-05-11T01:35:00.000Z	hhp2k1	mzz	Not bad, good for everyday use ... just like this one, but this one chokes if you give it too much to do
2009-05-11T01:36:00.000Z	mzz	hhp2k1	upgrading the ram from 512MiB to 1280MiB really helped multitasking-wise. Running a browser with a bunch of tabs tends to eat up 200MiB or so, so there's not that much room left with 512 total.
2009-05-11T01:36:00.000Z	mzz	hhp2k1	well, not quite 200MiB, but still
2009-05-11T01:36:00.000Z	hhp2k1	mzz	Not quite, but close. :P
2009-05-11T01:37:00.000Z	mzz	hhp2k1	other specs don't matter as much as long as you're a bit patient and know how to use "nice" on long-running tasks
2009-05-11T01:38:00.000Z	hhp2k1	mzz	Really, I think I'm just going to invest a bit of money into a new mobo and a 512 stick of DDR (I already have one kicking around, so I'd be up to a gig)
2009-05-11T01:38:00.000Z	hhp2k1	mzz	I hate the fact that I'm on SDRAM and Usb1.1 ... I feel like an old man :P
2009-05-11T01:39:00.000Z	mzz	hhp2k1	yeah, upgrades get a bit hard to come by (had some fun finding a new cpu heatsink+fan for an old system recently)
2009-05-11T01:40:00.000Z	hhp2k1	mzz	That's always a trip, eh? Reminds me of a buddy of mine who builds computers, a big lug with a temper ... I can't remember how many mobo's hes destroyed trying to remove intel P4 heatsinks
