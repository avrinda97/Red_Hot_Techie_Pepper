2012-06-02T14:34:00.000Z	sacarlson	oyost	for gui stuf like that I like glade as a development tool
2012-06-02T14:35:00.000Z	oyost	sacarlson	yeah using that how do i make a menu
2012-06-02T14:35:00.000Z	oyost	sacarlson	i cant seem to figure out, not a menu wait lemme rephrase
2012-06-02T14:36:00.000Z	oyost	sacarlson	i am making a basic calc, so i need to add buttons for 1 2 3 + - etc so how do i make that any idea?
2012-06-02T14:36:00.000Z	sacarlson	oyost	maybe look at some examples of glade apps to get an idea,  I have on writen in ruby but you can find examples writen in python also

2012-06-02T14:39:00.000Z	sacarlson	oyost	I mean real applications not must examples
2012-06-02T14:40:00.000Z	oyost	sacarlson	a whole real app i think is too much. i'm new to python and glade so will take time to get used to it, will still check out the site though. thanks
