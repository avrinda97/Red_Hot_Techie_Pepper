2005-01-02T12:12:00.000Z	mojo_		but i am not sure i could give you a succinct answer cuz i am not all brushed up on that for ya
2005-01-02T12:13:00.000Z	mojo_		windows nt, 2000, and stuff from that gene pool is a lot more secure than the windows, windows 95, windows me/you/all your base are belong to us strain
2005-01-02T12:13:00.000Z	djuuss	mojo_	true
2005-01-02T12:14:00.000Z	djuuss		but they're secure for *inbound* connections. Especially XP phones home like ET on steroids
2005-01-02T12:14:00.000Z	mojo_		nt, or 'new technology', was actually a full-on new os design.  windows and such before that was really a bunch of stuff 'stuck' on top of dos that grew like a polyp that eventuallyu wanted to fall off and walk on its own
2005-01-02T12:15:00.000Z	djuuss		rating: 5 (insightful)
2005-01-02T12:17:00.000Z	djuuss		wine or cygwin
2005-01-02T12:17:00.000Z	djuuss		e
2005-01-02T12:17:00.000Z	djuuss		if your running XChat on windows?
2005-01-02T12:18:00.000Z	djuuss		omg.. just when i'm trying to figure out what distro's to get, distrowatch is down
2005-01-02T12:18:00.000Z	mojo_		speaking of kernels, i just installed this ubuntu last night.  it put a generic x86-64 kernel on here.  how do i switch it to the amd64 kernel?  i 'installed' it with synaptic but it still boots to the x86_64 kernel... ???
2005-01-02T12:18:00.000Z	djuuss		woops.. thought distrowatch was a .org
2005-01-02T12:18:00.000Z	mojo_		distrowatch is back up
2005-01-02T12:19:00.000Z	mojo_		at least it works for me...
2005-01-02T12:19:00.000Z	mojo_	drspin	- yeah, i just got this installed yesterday
2005-01-02T12:19:00.000Z	djuuss		yeah i tried distrowatch.org
2005-01-02T12:19:00.000Z	djuuss	mojo_	but all they have is livecd's anyhow
