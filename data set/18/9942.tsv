2007-02-02T12:46:00.000Z	Onburiiku		Biig question for y'all
2007-02-02T12:46:00.000Z	Onburiiku		I finally got my LiveCD working
2007-02-02T12:47:00.000Z	Onburiiku		but it's a dapper CD
2007-02-02T12:47:00.000Z	Onburiiku		Should I download and burn Edgy or stick with my old-ish dapper CD?
2007-02-02T12:47:00.000Z	Onburiiku		Basically Dapper or Edgy?
2007-02-02T12:49:00.000Z	frogzoo	Onburiiku	it will take maybe 4 hrs total installing edgy from scratch, gnome is much faster & suspend works, worth it imo
2007-02-02T12:50:00.000Z	frogzoo	Onburiiku	except that feisty is out in 2 months - you're somewhat in the middle now
2007-02-06T08:13:00.000Z	frogzoo	Onburiiku	very possibly a video driver problem - edgy
2007-02-06T08:13:00.000Z	frogzoo	Onburiiku	very possibly a video driver problem - edgy's suspend works better, as do more recent vid drivers
2007-02-06T08:18:00.000Z	frogzoo	Onburiiku	yep, upgrade your vid driver
2007-02-06T08:18:00.000Z	frogzoo	Onburiiku	also, consider edgy if dapper won't work
2007-02-06T08:19:00.000Z	frogzoo	Onburiiku	if ctrl alt f1 doesn't work, & you can't ssh in, and ctrl alt del doesn't work, you'll have to hit the power off
2007-02-06T08:21:00.000Z	frogzoo	Onburiiku	every time you boot?
2007-02-06T08:23:00.000Z	frogzoo	Onburiiku	try booting in recover mode
2007-02-06T08:25:00.000Z	frogzoo	Onburiiku	hit 'esc' to interrupt the grub timeout
2007-02-06T08:28:00.000Z	frogzoo	Onburiiku	just hit 'esc' continuously at power on - should get you a grub prompt, then select revovery mode
2007-02-06T08:44:00.000Z	Onburiiku	frogzoo	I made some mock-up screenshots in the gimp. This is pretty much exactly what happens:
2007-02-07T06:01:00.000Z	frogzoo	Onburiiku	I'm guessing (only guessing) that if you rename the file, /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/resume  you'll be able to boot
