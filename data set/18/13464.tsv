2005-12-02T06:50:00.000Z	ZeZu	lightbright	a redundant array of inexpensive disks ;)
2005-12-02T07:04:00.000Z	lightbright	ZeZu	why?
2005-12-02T07:06:00.000Z	lightbright	ZeZu	not problems, challenges that help us grow :)
2005-12-02T07:06:00.000Z	lightbright	ZeZu	there are people who have it working too
2005-12-02T07:07:00.000Z	lightbright	ZeZu	so its user ignorance only and thats why we learn and grow
