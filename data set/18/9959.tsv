2007-01-27T14:48:00.000Z	fbc		how can I get ubuntu to recognize my keyboard?? It's not USB, just regular PS\2. I've already tried other keyboards.
2007-01-27T14:49:00.000Z	devnore	fbc	PS/2 keyboards should be recogniced by the kernel
2007-01-27T14:49:00.000Z	fbc	devnore	 it doesn't
2007-01-27T14:51:00.000Z	devnore	fbc	sounds like a bios issue
2007-01-27T14:51:00.000Z	fbc	devnore	 Yep, but how do I get around it_
2007-01-27T14:51:00.000Z	devnore	fbc	found anything in bios that points to keyboard USB being on?
2007-01-27T14:52:00.000Z	devnore	fbc	if it is, disable it and try again
2007-01-27T14:52:00.000Z	fbc	devnore	 Yep, but I disabled it. Just in case, but it still won't recognize the keyboard.
2007-01-27T14:52:00.000Z	devnore	fbc	and it recognices other keyboards?
2007-01-27T14:53:00.000Z	fbc	devnore	 Nope, no other keyboards are recognized, I don't have a USB keyboard to test with either..
2007-01-27T14:54:00.000Z	devnore	fbc	sounds like the ps/2 is damaged
2007-01-27T14:54:00.000Z	fbc	devnore	 Why does it work for configuring the bios and whatnot.
2007-01-27T14:56:00.000Z	devnore	fbc	that's what's puzzeling me... :S
2007-01-27T14:58:00.000Z	devnore	fbc	try reseting the bios to default settings
2007-01-27T15:24:00.000Z	fbc	devnore	 I started diabling crap and the keyboard started to work.. I'm gonna start turning things on again in stages to see where it get hung up...
2007-01-27T15:27:00.000Z	devnore	fbc	sweet
2007-01-27T15:39:00.000Z	fbc	devnore	 It turned out to be the GATE20A option in the BIOS...
2007-01-27T15:39:00.000Z	fbc	devnore	 My keyboard is working fine now!!! YEAh!!!!
