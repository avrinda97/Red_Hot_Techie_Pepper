2008-09-12T05:33:00.000Z	Thoku	SebNaitsabes	Does running on "unstable" give you the next release automatically when it enters beta? Or is unstable, just running unstable updates for the current release and therefore hardly any features included.
2008-09-12T05:35:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	Thoku	yes  if you  get the unstable.  it should auto update fine untill the final release.  however  that was not quite the case when I got Ubuntu way to early with Gutsy Gibbon.  in fact updates made things worse in the end.   and  I had to just wait untill  the final was nearer.  ,but that's what I got for getting Ubuntu to early as a non developer :D
2008-09-12T05:36:00.000Z	Thoku	SebNaitsabes	Ah lol
2008-09-12T05:37:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	Thoku	 if  your doing mission critical stuff on your compute probably best to wait untill the final.  if not  the beta should be fine
2008-09-12T05:37:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	Thoku	and yes Ubuntu can be upgraded from release to release.
2008-09-12T05:38:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	Thoku	no need to re install every time
2008-09-12T05:38:00.000Z	Thoku	SebNaitsabes	Yeah, its just my desktop machine.
2008-09-12T05:39:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	Thoku	some packages in the next one such as Banshee can actsaully get in Hardy
2008-09-12T05:39:00.000Z	Thoku	SebNaitsabes	Ah sweet, so early versions can be picked up individually.
2008-09-12T05:40:00.000Z	Thoku	SebNaitsabes	Ah so its catching up with the latest version. I see
2008-09-12T05:40:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	Thoku	so the next version will have later versions.  otherwise it's just security verisons. unless it's something like say Firefox
2008-09-12T05:41:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	Thoku	Ubuntu only does security updates,  unless it's a program like Firefox
2008-09-12T05:41:00.000Z	Thoku	SebNaitsabes	Something really high profile. OK
2008-09-12T05:42:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	Thoku	Fedora Core for example is more cutting edge since it gets later packages rather soon after stable release
2008-09-12T05:43:00.000Z	Thoku	SebNaitsabes	I guess its finding the right balance between latest features and stability
2008-09-12T05:44:00.000Z	SebNaitsabes	Thoku	  also  Ubuntu's repo is based on one of the Debian repos. so by the time the final is out,  the repo is already behind with tons of packages
2008-09-12T05:45:00.000Z	Thoku	SebNaitsabes	Ah I had presumed that just the kernel and lower level stuff like that came directly from debian. But I suppose it makes sense.
