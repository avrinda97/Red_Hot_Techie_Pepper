2010-03-13T15:44:00.000Z	azroon		ok, i got a laptop with ati mobility hd3650, selected driver from system>administration>hardware drivers, clicked enable, then rebooted to a blank screen with flashing caps lock - what now? ubuntu 9.10
2010-03-13T15:46:00.000Z	azroon		anyone//??
2010-03-13T15:46:00.000Z	acicula	azroon	boot into the rescue mode and try reconfiguring the xserver from there
2010-03-13T15:50:00.000Z	acicula	azroon	whats the description for dpkg
2010-03-13T15:51:00.000Z	acicula	azroon	hmm thats not it then
2010-03-13T15:51:00.000Z	acicula	azroon	you could drop to a shell and try to remove the graphic driver form the root shell prompt
2010-03-13T15:58:00.000Z	acicula	azroon	remove the xorg-driver-fglrx package from the console via apt-get remove xorg-driver-fglrx ?
2010-03-13T16:03:00.000Z	azroon	acicula	ubuntu is now running in low graphics mode fine but we need graphic drivers for the ati mobility 3650
2010-03-13T16:03:00.000Z	acicula	azroon	the open source drivers should give you better resolution?
2010-03-13T16:05:00.000Z	acicula	azroon	 sudo apt-get purge xorg-driver-fglrx fglrx-amdcccle fglrx-kernel-source xorg-driver-fglrx-dev to make sure the fglrx is not interfering,
2010-03-13T16:11:00.000Z	azroon	acicula	didnt work
2010-03-13T16:13:00.000Z	acicula	azroon	didnt you have graphics working again?
2010-03-13T16:15:00.000Z	acicula	azroon	well at least we coverred one hurdle
2010-03-13T16:15:00.000Z	acicula	azroon	for some reason the open source drivers(that give you better resolution) dont appear to be enabled
2010-03-13T16:17:00.000Z	acicula	azroon	there are two versions , open source and binary ati drivers
2010-03-13T16:22:00.000Z	azroon	acicula	will you quit being a girl i said 'dick' get over it ;)
2010-03-13T16:25:00.000Z	acicula	azroon	i consider your behaviour abrasive and rude so i will not help you further no
