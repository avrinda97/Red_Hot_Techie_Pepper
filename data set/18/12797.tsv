2011-06-28T19:08:00.000Z	jc-denton		sure
2011-06-28T19:09:00.000Z	jc-denton		wtf
2011-06-28T19:09:00.000Z	jc-denton		why these uuids?
2011-06-28T19:09:00.000Z	jc-denton		and why are they suddenly wrong?
2011-06-28T19:10:00.000Z	jc-denton		now i'm in that initramfs thing and typing mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt tells me that sdb1 is not there
2011-06-28T19:10:00.000Z	jc-denton		fdisk: command not found
2011-06-28T19:11:00.000Z	jc-denton		id: command not found
2011-06-28T19:11:00.000Z	jc-denton		but i think i'm root, what's that initramfs anyways?
2011-06-28T19:11:00.000Z	jc-denton		grub/lilo used to be that simple, the uuid mess is just a disappointment
2011-06-28T19:12:00.000Z	jc-denton		so what can I do to make my system boot again?
2011-06-28T19:13:00.000Z	dr_Willis	jc-denton	 it could be a hd died if youcant mount it. ckeck with fdisk a d  gparted and in the bios
