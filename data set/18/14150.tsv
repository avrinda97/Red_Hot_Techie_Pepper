2006-01-01T17:58:00.000Z	odat		anyone have any opinions on the best video player for linux
2006-01-01T17:59:00.000Z	odat		i have been trying to give totem and gstreamer a chance but am getting frustrated in their performance
2006-01-01T17:59:00.000Z	mwe	odat	best is a matter of taste. I prefer gmplayer
2006-01-01T06:00:00.000Z	mwe	odat	I second that, but a lot of people seem to enjoy it
2006-01-01T06:00:00.000Z	mwe	odat	it's great
2006-01-01T06:01:00.000Z	odat	mwe	totem and gstreamer are jerky and out of sync most of the time
2006-01-01T06:02:00.000Z	mwe	odat	I gave up gstreamer too and went with xine and mplayer
2006-01-01T06:04:00.000Z	mwe	odat	I'd go with mplayer, but that's just me
2006-01-08T13:26:00.000Z	mwe	odat	hurry up or it wont be quick
2006-01-08T13:26:00.000Z	mwe	odat	optimization
2006-01-08T13:49:00.000Z	mwe	odat	why would you try ro turn off security?
2006-01-10T16:36:00.000Z	mwe	odat	when are you getting that? when it starts at boot?
2006-01-10T16:37:00.000Z	odat	mwe	yes
2006-01-10T16:38:00.000Z	mwe	odat	well I can't help much but telling you to look at the log files
2006-01-10T16:38:00.000Z	mwe	odat	/var/log/gdm/
2006-04-06T16:37:00.000Z	mwe	odat	it should be easy to make it work with dhcp. the installer should auto configure the connection, usually
2006-04-20T16:52:00.000Z	mwe	odat	kill pid
2006-04-20T16:52:00.000Z	mwe	odat	you need sudo for processes not owned by you
