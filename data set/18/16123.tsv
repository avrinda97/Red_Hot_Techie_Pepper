2004-11-07T13:20:00.000Z	__daniel	corbob	maybe you'd check  /va/log/syslog  after booting it again
2004-11-07T13:21:00.000Z	__daniel	corbob	that shouldnt be the problem
2004-11-07T13:21:00.000Z	__daniel	corbob	after a crash reboot and to this:     tail -n 300 /var/log/syslog | more     and read up to the point where it crashed

2004-11-07T14:01:00.000Z	__daniel	corbob	have a look at the manufacturer's site, they sometimes have testing tools too
