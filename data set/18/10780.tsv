2006-10-26T06:07:00.000Z	niksavel		that's just great
2006-10-26T06:07:00.000Z	niksavel		downloaded the edgy livecd in 6 minutes via x downloader, but it takes 100+hrs to update the distro   !?
2006-10-26T06:08:00.000Z	niksavel		but I really dont wanna leave my laptop here on the university to update everything for few days
2006-10-26T06:09:00.000Z	niksavel		and if I cancel the dist-upgrade it starts from scratch
2006-10-26T06:09:00.000Z	niksavel		u sure?
2006-10-26T06:09:00.000Z	JoseStefan	niksavel	it shouldnt start from scratch, but if it is already installing, you shouldnt cancel
2006-10-26T06:10:00.000Z	JoseStefan	niksavel	its only safe to cancel if it is downloading
2006-10-27T12:47:00.000Z	JoseStefan	niksavel	make sure you have the universe repo
2006-10-27T12:49:00.000Z	JoseStefan	niksavel	look for the pkg info @ http://packages.ubuntu.com/libarts1-audiofile   and see what dependencies you are missing
2006-10-27T12:53:00.000Z	JoseStefan	niksavel	you will need to CHECK if you can remove libmpeg-dev, so you can install the other one
2006-10-27T12:55:00.000Z	niksavel	JoseStefan	HOW for the love of god???  :)
2006-10-27T12:55:00.000Z	JoseStefan	niksavel	use synaptic, try to remove it and it will complain if it is needed for something else. If it does complain dont remove it
2006-10-27T12:57:00.000Z	niksavel	JoseStefan	it wasnt even installed
2006-10-27T12:59:00.000Z	JoseStefan	niksavel	try sudo apt-get install  kdemultimedia-dev
2006-10-27T13:01:00.000Z	JoseStefan	niksavel	follow the food chain, try installing that one
2006-10-27T13:01:00.000Z	JoseStefan	niksavel	or try installing the pkg in synaptic, as it is smarter
2006-10-27T13:03:00.000Z	JoseStefan	niksavel	mixed repos maybe
2006-10-27T13:06:00.000Z	JoseStefan	niksavel	stick to the official repos only, until you finish the upgrade
