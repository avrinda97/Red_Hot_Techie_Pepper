2007-04-09T14:28:00.000Z	livenicely		my browser settings are direct to internet and disabled sock for dial up
2007-04-09T14:29:00.000Z	Daverocks	livenicely	yeah, it's not really konqueror's problem, pppd provides direct internet access through a interface

2007-04-09T14:31:00.000Z	Daverocks	livenicely	hm, compare kubuntu's ppp settings with ubuntu's
