2004-09-27T11:00:00.000Z	xxor		problem is .. no graphical cd burning apps , support that bullshit
2004-09-27T11:01:00.000Z	xxor		so .. hrm , gotta fix it somehow
2004-09-27T11:02:00.000Z	xxor		k3b is the best burning app Ive seen so far
2004-09-27T11:02:00.000Z	xxor		going to add queue support for it
2004-09-27T11:03:00.000Z	xxor		I prefer gnome , but kde has some real good apps too
2004-09-27T11:04:00.000Z	neighborlee	xxor	ditto that
2004-09-27T11:04:00.000Z	neighborlee	xxor	one of my favs is that kde modeler based on POV...very interesting
2005-02-07T16:44:00.000Z	neighborlee	xxor	better hardware detect..non anal install and targeted to be 'easy to use' out of the box for most things..and usually non-RTFM community meaning we're usually nicer
2005-02-07T16:44:00.000Z	neighborlee	xxor	imo of course ;-)
2005-02-07T16:45:00.000Z	neighborlee	xxor	oh and we have udev and project utopia and gnome2.8 <G>...that about wraps it up LOL
2005-02-07T16:45:00.000Z	xxor	neighborlee	its not 100% functional .. gnome 2.8 I mean , I remember alot of bugs when I ran it the first time
2005-02-07T16:46:00.000Z	neighborlee	xxor	shrug i've encountered zero show stoppers
2005-02-07T16:46:00.000Z	neighborlee	xxor	the typical issue with gnome panel being a little weird after first reboot...none beyond that
