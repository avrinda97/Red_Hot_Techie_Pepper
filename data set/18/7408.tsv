2008-01-13T09:59:00.000Z	danloz		Zenobius:  The cube rules.
2008-01-13T10:00:00.000Z	danloz		the scale function is gangster too
2008-01-13T10:00:00.000Z	danloz		Proqesi:  Does that mean the address is shot?  Or try again later?
2008-01-13T10:01:00.000Z	danloz		I'm trying to download the broadcom driver.  I heard if you manage to get a broad com wireless card working, cannonical sends you a pin.
2008-01-13T10:02:00.000Z	danloz		Cabrioleur:  They don't really send you a pin.  But for the pain in the testicles that it is (especially for my n000b self) they ought send me a pin.
2008-01-13T10:02:00.000Z	Noogen	danloz	i think when you read it, it was a typo, more like a pin(g)
2008-01-13T10:48:00.000Z	Noogen	danloz	are you on gutsy?
2008-01-13T10:49:00.000Z	Noogen	danloz	and you are trying to install bcm43xx driver?
2008-01-13T10:49:00.000Z	danloz	Noogen	 Yes.
2008-01-13T10:49:00.000Z	Noogen	danloz	have you try - https://help.ubuntu.com/community/WifiDocs/Driver/bcm43xx/Gutsy
2008-01-13T10:52:00.000Z	danloz	Noogen	 The restricted driver doesn't work.  I just tried the one that came with the install and the colonel keeps throwing errors out.
2008-01-13T10:52:00.000Z	danloz	Noogen	 So this is a different one?
2008-01-13T10:53:00.000Z	Noogen	danloz	note on the page - "The firmware code is still not distributed with Ubuntu and must be downloaded and extracted before bcm43xx will work."
2008-01-13T10:55:00.000Z	danloz	Noogen	 What's the risk level trying this?
2008-01-13T10:56:00.000Z	Noogen	danloz	lower than it would with ndiswrapper
2008-01-13T10:56:00.000Z	Noogen	danloz	mine was a server installation so the server install instruction was very straight forward
2008-01-13T10:57:00.000Z	Noogen	danloz	since server environment doesn't have restircted enable, it was basically no risk
