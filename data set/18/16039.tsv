2006-01-23T10:38:00.000Z	bur[n] er_	Jeffi	permissions problem
2006-01-23T10:41:00.000Z	bur[n] er_	Jeffi	fix your permissions, you can't read the files you're trying to copy or you're trying to paste in a folder you don't have write priveleges to
2006-01-23T10:43:00.000Z	bur[n] er_	Jeffi	heard of sudo?
2006-01-23T10:44:00.000Z	bur[n] er_	Jeffi	use sudo... if you don't know what I mean by that, don't move files to /usr/local/games and just put them in your ~/
2006-01-23T10:46:00.000Z	bur[n] er_	Jeffi	read it
2006-01-23T10:46:00.000Z	bur[n] er_	Jeffi	"sudo programtolaunch"
2006-01-23T10:46:00.000Z	bur[n] er_	Jeffi	for example, "sudo nautilus"
2006-01-23T10:46:00.000Z	bur[n] er_	Jeffi	it's not, and if you don't understand it, I'd say re-read it
2006-01-23T10:47:00.000Z	bur[n] er_	Jeffi	cd ~/Desktop/hello
2006-01-23T10:51:00.000Z	bur[n] er_	Jeffi	it's case specific... and use tab-completion
2006-01-23T10:52:00.000Z	bur[n] er_	Jeffi	follow the path with tab-completion
2006-01-23T10:52:00.000Z	bur[n] er_	Jeffi	cd
2006-01-23T10:52:00.000Z	bur[n] er_	Jeffi	then run "ls"
