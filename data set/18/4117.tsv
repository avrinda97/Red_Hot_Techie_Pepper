2009-06-03T06:37:00.000Z	rweait		have a problem after upgrading from intrepid to jaunty.  Boot to single-mode is fine.  normal boot puts garbage on video and makes keyboard / mouse completely frozen.  Can't switch to console.  Can ssh in.
2009-06-03T06:37:00.000Z	cabrey	rweait	what graphics card do you have?
2009-06-03T06:37:00.000Z	rweait	cabrey	 ATI Technologies Inc RV350 AQ [Radeon 9600]
2009-06-03T06:38:00.000Z	cabrey	rweait	did you have ATI's drivers installed before?
2009-06-03T06:38:00.000Z	cabrey	rweait	from Hardware Drivers window?
2009-06-03T06:38:00.000Z	rweait	cabrey	perhaps from ati install disk?
2009-06-03T06:40:00.000Z	cabrey	rweait	you don't want ATI's drivers, they aren't supported for your card on Jaunty
2009-06-03T06:40:00.000Z	cabrey	rweait	you want the open source driver
2009-06-03T06:41:00.000Z	rweait	cabrey	is there an apt-get install I should run to do that?
2009-06-03T06:41:00.000Z	cabrey	rweait	sudo apt-get remove fglrx
2009-06-03T06:42:00.000Z	cabrey	rweait	my mistake it is actually sudo apt-get remove xorg-driver-fglrx
2009-06-03T06:42:00.000Z	rweait	cabrey	running it now...
2009-06-03T06:45:00.000Z	rweait	cabrey	 looks good!
2009-06-03T06:46:00.000Z	cabrey	rweait	did you reboot yet?
2009-06-03T06:46:00.000Z	rweait	cabrey	going across the room to check it now.  Logon window looks awesome!
2009-06-03T06:46:00.000Z	cabrey	rweait	sounds good
2009-06-03T06:47:00.000Z	rweait	cabrey	thanks so much.  Even dual monitors are working!
