2006-10-28T10:39:00.000Z	andresmujica		SCORPONE: Then try to download rpm package and use alien -i file.rpm
2006-10-28T10:41:00.000Z	Scorpmoon	andresmujica	how do I see in Add/Remove programs what version the found software is?
2006-10-28T10:42:00.000Z	andresmujica	Scorpmoon	 someone said it' s v 1.0 and that u wanted the v2.  so you can try with alien -i package.rpm
2006-10-28T10:43:00.000Z	Scorpmoon	andresmujica	so the ubuntu repositories are not the same as the debian ones?
2006-10-28T10:43:00.000Z	andresmujica	Scorpmoon	Not sir. let me check here which version it has
2006-10-28T10:43:00.000Z	Scorpmoon	andresmujica	is alien a command that comes with ubuntu? and what do I do after I run that
2006-10-28T10:45:00.000Z	Scorpmoon	andresmujica	this is way too complicated for me.. it says I need to download two rpm files
2006-10-28T10:49:00.000Z	andresmujica	Scorpmoon	give me a minute i' ll try to help you if i can... gimme a minute
2006-10-28T10:54:00.000Z	andresmujica	Scorpmoon	try this install frozen-bubble  from add/remove programs
2006-10-28T10:54:00.000Z	Scorpmoon	andresmujica	have you verified that is 2.0.0 ?
2006-10-28T10:55:00.000Z	Scorpmoon	andresmujica	what do you mean "go there" .. that's an ftp?
2006-10-28T10:55:00.000Z	Scorpmoon	andresmujica	can't I just install 2.0 without installing 1.0 first?
2006-10-28T10:56:00.000Z	andresmujica	Scorpmoon	Probably forozen-buble has some dependencies that are not there. so trying to cover you i' m suggesting to install the version 1 in the hope that you cover all the required packages before install v2
