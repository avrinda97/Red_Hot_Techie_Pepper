2008-10-07T19:52:00.000Z	tux		need help with a scsi hard drive
2008-10-07T19:52:00.000Z	tux		does ubuntu support scsi hdd
2008-10-07T19:52:00.000Z	tux		?!?
2008-10-07T19:53:00.000Z	erUSUL	tux	yes
2008-10-07T19:56:00.000Z	erUSUL	tux	you will have to give in one line more details... the controller you are using for a start etc
2008-10-07T19:57:00.000Z	erUSUL	tux	what scasi controller you are suing
2008-10-07T19:57:00.000Z	erUSUL	tux	what scsi controller you are suing
2008-10-07T19:58:00.000Z	erUSUL	tux	"lspci" for example or "lshw" or in "dmesg" maybe preparing pastebins with the output of those commands
2008-10-07T20:01:00.000Z	erUSUL	tux	SCSI storage controller: Adaptec ASC-39320D (rev 03)
2008-10-07T20:01:00.000Z	erUSUL	tux	dmesg > dmesg.txt && gedit dmesg.txt (paste that file too)
2008-10-07T20:02:00.000Z	erUSUL	tux	« dmesg > dmesg.txt && gedit dmesg.txt » run that command line
2008-10-07T20:06:00.000Z	erUSUL	tux	paste the file in pastebin so i can look into it
2008-10-07T20:06:00.000Z	erUSUL	tux	dmesg output is too long so  is easier to save it to a file and paste it that way
2008-10-07T20:09:00.000Z	erUSUL	tux	no that's your optical drive... look this http://paste.ubuntu.com/55030/
2008-10-07T20:09:00.000Z	erUSUL	tux	something is wrong with the scasi disk (or at least linux thinks so)
2008-10-07T20:10:00.000Z	erUSUL	tux	medium error is not very encouraging ...
2008-10-07T20:11:00.000Z	erUSUL	tux	dunno what is exactly wrong... coulb be a kernel bug too. you can try with a livecd of another dsitribution or another ubuntu version ....
2008-10-07T20:12:00.000Z	erUSUL	tux	you know now what to look for... if the error is reproducible across different kernels ... then dunno what the next sted could be...
