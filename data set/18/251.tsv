2012-05-22T01:55:00.000Z	APoulos		Does anyone know how to fix a distorted Ubuntu boot splash screen?
2012-05-22T01:55:00.000Z	APoulos		because when I ran the Live CD it didnt do that
2012-05-22T01:55:00.000Z	APoulos		it looked fine
2012-05-22T01:57:00.000Z	Aprel	APoulos	were you originally using on-board graphics?
2012-05-22T02:02:00.000Z	APoulos	Aprel	no, its been like that since I installed it. it wasnt like that when i ran it from Live CD
2012-05-22T02:02:00.000Z	APoulos	Aprel	you get me?
2012-05-22T02:04:00.000Z	Aprel	APoulos	The only thing I can think of is the live cd loads an nVidia driver right away at boot, but once it's installed, it uses generic settings....
2012-05-22T02:05:00.000Z	Aprel	APoulos	I had the same prob. I used to use on-board gfx, then added a video card, and have the same stretched splach screen :/
2012-05-22T02:06:00.000Z	APoulos	Aprel	 I'll screen cap it for you. to show you what I have -
