2008-01-04T19:08:00.000Z	kbrosnan	iddo	don't uninstall firefox 2, just install firefox 3 using the manual instructions at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FirefoxNewVersion
2008-01-04T19:24:00.000Z	iddo		is there a good way to install firefox3 and uninstall firefox2 in gutsy? swiftfox maybe?
2008-01-04T19:24:00.000Z	kbrosnan	iddo	the manual install directions i linked to you, https://help.ubuntu.com/community/FirefoxNewVersion
2008-01-04T19:25:00.000Z	iddo		oh
2008-01-04T19:25:00.000Z	iddo	kbrosnan	why not uninstall firefox2 ?
2008-01-04T19:26:00.000Z	iddo		i see firefox depends on ubuntu-desktop :(
2008-01-04T19:26:00.000Z	kbrosnan	iddo	because i have seen it cause problems for people and leaving it there won't cause any problems
2008-01-04T19:29:00.000Z	iddo	kbrosnan	that FirefoxNewVersion seems to be for old ubuntu 5.10 or 6.10, not 7.10
2008-01-04T19:29:00.000Z	kbrosnan	iddo	the directions are still the same
2008-01-04T19:30:00.000Z	iddo	kbrosnan	but if no uninstall, why do any of it? whats wrong with just installing latest firefox3 deb e.g. swiftfox ?
2008-01-04T19:32:00.000Z	kbrosnan	iddo	i dislike swiftfox as crash reports don't get sent to mozilla and i feel the tweaks they do are questionable in the amount of the speen increase in real world browsing
2008-01-04T19:34:00.000Z	iddo	kbrosnan	ok, is there a good latest firefox3 deb or apt-get repository you recommend instead? why all the manual in FirefoxNewVersion needed?
2008-01-04T19:37:00.000Z	kbrosnan	iddo	i belive there may be one, but i don't use it. i just extract to my home folder, link the plugins I need and create a new profile http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/3.0b2/releasenotes/
2008-01-04T19:39:00.000Z	iddo	kbrosnan	is it ok to link /usr/bin/firefox to the new firefox3 ?
2008-01-04T19:43:00.000Z	kbrosnan	iddo	link /usr/local/bin to firefox as that location is more important than /usr/bin/
2008-01-04T19:45:00.000Z	iddo	kbrosnan	so then the new firefox3 be used when firefox is called? then why not uninstall firefox2? no one will even call usr/bin/firefox anymore, no?
2008-01-04T19:48:00.000Z	kbrosnan	iddo	from what i have seen it causes problems, i forget exactly what but i had firefox 3 installed on 7.10 and another guy had firefox 3 installed with firefox 2 removed and he had some sort of issue that did not resolve itself till he reinstalled firefox 2
2008-01-04T19:49:00.000Z	iddo	kbrosnan	ok thanks
