2011-11-01T23:50:00.000Z	cablop	riffautae	what is your question?
2011-11-01T23:50:00.000Z	riffautae	cablop	? i dont have one
2011-11-01T23:50:00.000Z	riffautae	cablop	well sorta, we are trying to figure out how big to make /var
2011-11-01T23:51:00.000Z	cablop	riffautae	it depends, var holds things like webpages if you use apache and tomcat servers and also databases,so for web development 2 gb is probably too few
2011-11-01T23:52:00.000Z	riffautae	cablop	however that can all be relocated
2011-11-01T23:52:00.000Z	riffautae	cablop	especially if he has a catch all partition for data on the hdd
2011-11-01T23:53:00.000Z	riffautae	cablop	just make a www and db folder on his hd partition and tell them to use that
2011-11-01T23:53:00.000Z	cablop	riffautae	or partition the thing using LVM
2011-11-02T00:06:00.000Z	riffautae	cablop	no since most distros dont remove old kernel packages
2011-11-02T00:06:00.000Z	riffautae	cablop	they will pile up
2011-11-02T00:11:00.000Z	riffautae	cablop	i never do, the os doesnt usualy thrash since ram is so cheap
2011-11-02T00:20:00.000Z	riffautae	cablop	i'd prolly do one encry partition with lvm but i have not benchmarked it
2011-11-02T00:20:00.000Z	riffautae	cablop	its what i have on my laptop
2011-11-02T00:21:00.000Z	riffautae	cablop	i didnt notice any drops but i didnt get to play with it much. compiles and such never had an issue
2011-11-02T00:33:00.000Z	riffautae	cablop	other then you cant use symnlinks across partitions, i dont think so
2011-11-02T00:34:00.000Z	cablop	riffautae	yes they work, but they are just softlinks, if the target dissapears you end with a wrong symlink
2011-11-02T00:35:00.000Z	riffautae	cablop	oh i see
2011-11-02T01:58:00.000Z	riffautae	cablop	a replacement protocol thingy over ide style
