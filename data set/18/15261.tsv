2005-05-04T08:04:00.000Z	djm62		it will take some time, but everything will be sorted
2005-05-04T08:06:00.000Z	djm62		kurwa...3am here
2005-05-04T08:06:00.000Z	djm62		am I about to completely ignore anyone if I go to smoke'n'sleep?
2005-05-04T08:06:00.000Z	Amaranth	djm62	Helix Player is worthless.
2005-05-04T08:06:00.000Z	djm62	Amaranth	it works for me...everything's ultimately worthless
2005-05-04T08:07:00.000Z	Amaranth	djm62	It doesn't include the Real codecs which is the only reason to use Real over Totem or vlc.
2005-05-04T08:07:00.000Z	djm62	Amaranth	but it's nice to hear other opinions ;)
2005-05-04T08:07:00.000Z	djm62	Amaranth	the version of real which is based on helix is a pretty good example of writing for linux
2005-05-04T08:08:00.000Z	Amaranth	djm62	Yeah, RealPlayer is awesome because it's a slick app that supports Real files, but without that it's just a slick video playing app in a sea of many that are better.
2005-05-04T08:09:00.000Z	djm62	Amaranth	they're also doing the Right Thing(tm) wrt providing a PPC build as well...don't see that from macromedia
2005-05-04T08:10:00.000Z	Amaranth	djm62	Not hard when your community provides you with a PPC build of Helix Player and your app is just Helix Player + codecs. ;)
2005-05-04T08:10:00.000Z	djm62	Amaranth	still a lot harder than _not_ doing it, which is the default
2005-05-04T08:11:00.000Z	djm62	Amaranth	I think they're genuinely close to "getting it", seeing as the helix community by definition doesn't mind their work going into realplayer
2005-12-22T12:24:00.000Z	Amaranth	djm62	that's 6.04
2005-12-22T12:25:00.000Z	djm62	Amaranth	6.10, when people have had time to play with modular X ;)
2005-12-22T12:25:00.000Z	Amaranth	djm62	As long as Xorg 7 makes it for dapper 7.1 should make it for dapper+1, they are going to be 6 month releases. So yeah, it'll be nice.
2005-12-22T12:32:00.000Z	Amaranth	djm62	haha
