2007-01-06T13:36:00.000Z	Inaki		anyone got any idea why my MBR dies every time I shut down?
2007-01-06T13:36:00.000Z	Inaki		i have to use my livecd and chroot to my /target
2007-01-06T13:36:00.000Z	Inaki		and reinstall grub
2007-01-06T13:36:00.000Z	Jowi	Inaki	explain. what do you mean by "dies"
2007-01-06T13:37:00.000Z	Jowi	Inaki	and what brand is the laptop? a Vaio?
2007-01-06T13:38:00.000Z	Jowi	Inaki	so GRUB works once at the first boot or...?
2007-01-06T13:38:00.000Z	Jowi	Inaki	yes, but after it is reinstalled does it work once?
2007-01-06T13:39:00.000Z	Jowi	Inaki	so if you do not swap cd drives it still works?
2007-01-06T13:40:00.000Z	Jowi	Inaki	DELL ships with a pretty good hardware check (it's on one of the cds). use it to see if you have any hardware problems. might be a flaky HDD
2007-01-06T13:41:00.000Z	Inaki	Jowi	i bought this latitude from a guy.
2007-01-06T13:41:00.000Z	Jowi	Inaki	I think you can download it for free from dell.com as well.
2007-01-06T13:42:00.000Z	Inaki	Jowi	ty, but could it be a hardware issue?
2007-01-06T13:42:00.000Z	Jowi	Inaki	yes
2007-01-06T13:42:00.000Z	Jowi	Inaki	are you running on AC or battery?
2007-01-06T13:43:00.000Z	Jowi	Inaki	and even if you stay on AC will still say "no bootable device"?
2007-01-06T13:44:00.000Z	Jowi	Inaki	can be everything from bad mobo to bad HDD. use the hardware troubleshooting CD. it has nothing to do with Linux
2007-01-06T13:45:00.000Z	Jowi	Inaki	no. the MBR is independent of partitions
