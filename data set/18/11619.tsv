2007-03-09T08:30:00.000Z	naknomik		For the first time I just downloaded Ubuntu and installed it on my old ThinkPad T30 laptop. What I am not able to figure out is how to get my wireless working.
2007-03-09T08:31:00.000Z	martalli	naknomik	- what kind of wireless chip do you have?
2007-03-09T08:31:00.000Z	naknomik	martalli	I don't know, how do I find out?
2007-03-09T08:32:00.000Z	naknomik	martalli	I am positive. There is even a 802.11b MAC address written on the back.
2007-03-09T08:34:00.000Z	naknomik	martalli	This is what I find, besides many other entries. 02:02.0 Network controller: Intersil Corporation Prism 2.5 Wavelan chipset (rev 01)
2007-03-09T08:35:00.000Z	martalli	naknomik	- prism usually works, but our website writer says it was flaky for him
2007-03-09T08:38:00.000Z	martalli	naknomik	- aptitude is a command line program
2007-03-09T08:38:00.000Z	naknomik	martalli	dabaR: If I run the aptitude command will it replace my gnome programs with KDE?
2007-03-09T08:39:00.000Z	martalli	naknomik	- better yet, it will clutter your computer with both lol
2007-03-09T08:42:00.000Z	martalli	naknomik	- betetr as in beter at resolving dependencies (sorry to not make that clear)
2007-03-09T08:43:00.000Z	martalli	naknomik	- that sounds strange since I am looking at it in my synaptic window
2007-03-09T08:45:00.000Z	naknomik	martalli	where is the sources.list file ?
2007-03-09T08:46:00.000Z	martalli	naknomik	/etc/apt
2007-03-09T08:47:00.000Z	naknomik	martalli	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/9364/
2007-03-09T08:49:00.000Z	martalli	naknomik	- I think your sources.list file is fine for downloading kubuntu-desktop
2007-03-09T08:49:00.000Z	martalli	naknomik	- try sudo aptitude update" first
2007-03-09T08:54:00.000Z	naknomik	martalli	now the update manager has started and is downloading some 139 packages, so I've to wait till it finishes.
2007-03-09T08:55:00.000Z	martalli	naknomik	congrats, you are headed for that shining city on a hill that is KDE
