2006-05-28T12:19:00.000Z	andrejkw		For some reason Ubuntu is not letting me have two routers plugged in (wireless, nic). Only one has internet connection connected. When both connections are enabled, nobody can connect to my computer (VNC, HTTP).

2006-05-28T12:21:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	andrejkw	You can only have one default route
2006-05-28T12:22:00.000Z	andrejkw		So how can I disable the other default route? I just want to be able to connec to PCS on both routers, only receive internet from one.

2006-05-28T12:25:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	andrejkw	Which connection is the internet connected to the wireless or wired ?
2006-05-28T12:25:00.000Z	andrejkw		wireless
2006-05-28T12:27:00.000Z	andrejkw	h3sp4wn	so...?
2006-05-28T12:27:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	andrejkw	remove the line at the very bottom of the file which says gateway 192.168.0.1 (run gksudo gedit /etc/network/interfaces)
2006-05-28T12:28:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	andrejkw	so what ?
2006-05-28T12:28:00.000Z	andrejkw	h3sp4wn	will i be able to enter the configuration page?
2006-05-28T12:28:00.000Z	andrejkw	h3sp4wn	of the router?
2006-05-28T12:29:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	andrejkw	yes presuming the router is on 192.168.0.1
2006-05-28T12:32:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	andrejkw	Then after you have edited the file run 'sudo ifdown eth0 && sudo ifdown eth1 && sudo ifup eth0 && sudo ifup eth1' (If you have other stuff on other networks behind the router read about setting up static routes)
