2005-10-15T14:01:00.000Z	lucaas	brownie17	have you added it outside the "debian auto-update" area?
2005-10-15T14:02:00.000Z	brownie17	lucaas	sorry, explain please?
2005-10-15T14:02:00.000Z	brownie17	lucaas	i am in hoary
2005-10-15T14:04:00.000Z	brownie17	lucaas	it isn't a kernel problem, this happened not from a kernel update, but destroying an old partition with win98
2005-10-15T14:07:00.000Z	lucaas	brownie17	you could do "sudo fdisk -l" to check what partitions you have
2005-10-15T14:08:00.000Z	brownie17	lucaas	where is the grub list stored again?
2005-10-15T14:10:00.000Z	brownie17	lucaas	i am having problems. in the grub thing, it stores partition names as examples (hdb0,0) rather than hda1 like fdisk does
2005-10-15T14:11:00.000Z	brownie17	lucaas	how can i find out which is which?
2005-10-15T14:12:00.000Z	lucaas	brownie17	what partition does your windows partition have?
2005-10-15T14:13:00.000Z	brownie17	lucaas	well windows is in my grub file fine then
2005-10-15T14:14:00.000Z	lucaas	brownie17	can you pm the windows section, and i'll check if see sth worng
2005-10-15T14:14:00.000Z	brownie17	lucaas	my windows one is hda1, and in the grub file it is hdb0,0 should i remove the b?
2005-10-15T14:17:00.000Z	lucaas	brownie17	hmmm, dunno, you could try with it or without it, and if it doesnt work, try the other
2005-10-15T14:21:00.000Z	brownie17	lucaas	didn't work still
2005-10-15T14:21:00.000Z	brownie17	lucaas	actually i think i might have forgotten to save
2005-10-15T14:22:00.000Z	brownie17	lucaas	nope, i saved. it didn't wokr
2005-10-15T14:22:00.000Z	brownie17	lucaas	take out the "makeactive" and try again?
