2007-03-05T13:22:00.000Z	Heavenquake	ompaul	now, the only stuff I find there, is more or less the same as in the tutorial I linked to. But it does not work.
2007-03-05T13:23:00.000Z	ompaul	Heavenquake	I sat here one day and walked a person through each step cut and pasted from it - then it worked after them saying it did not - the problem usually is that you miss one step please try again seriously, also I don't do wireless
2007-03-05T13:23:00.000Z	Heavenquake	ompaul	I doublechecked three times, read through a couple more, and did the tut all over again, just to be sure.
2007-03-05T13:24:00.000Z	ompaul	Heavenquake	does it work with that closed source semi popular o/s?
2007-03-05T13:24:00.000Z	Heavenquake	ompaul	it does.
2007-03-05T13:25:00.000Z	ompaul	Heavenquake	so then you can try that ndswrapper option cos it will work if you have the driver - it may be a little flakey but hey some bandwidth is better than none unless you got wired
2007-03-05T13:26:00.000Z	Heavenquake	ompaul	actually, I've done the ndiswrapper. It says in ndiswrapper -l that it works. It says in lshw that it works. But it simply does not.
2007-03-05T13:27:00.000Z	ompaul	Heavenquake	then what you need is a local GNU/Linux support jockey - cos IRC is not going to fix something like that 999/1000
2007-03-05T13:28:00.000Z	Heavenquake	ompaul	damn, I'm screwed then. Since I've been to two national linux-cons, where about fifteen people all in all, during the days, tried and make it work. But everything simply failed.
2007-03-05T13:29:00.000Z	ompaul	Heavenquake	there is another option, get a card and stick it in a pcmcia slot or some such - but check that it is supported first
2007-03-05T13:31:00.000Z	Heavenquake	ompaul	A friend of mine will hand over a tested (as in: working) USB-adaptor, during this week. But I really would have liked the builtin hardware to work. But well, can't have it all I guess
2007-03-05T13:33:00.000Z	ompaul	Heavenquake	please be careful when buying your next hardware - remember the manafacturer has a choice to lock you out or include your favorite platform and you can tell the retailer cos they get enough ear bashing then they may respond
2007-03-05T13:35:00.000Z	Heavenquake	ompaul	I learned a lesson yes. I think I'll stick with IBM/Lenovo in the future.. Perhaps DELL.  -- This laptop is one I bought before I became serious with GNU/Linux, so at that time, I didn't bother much.
2007-03-05T13:35:00.000Z	ompaul	Heavenquake	what make and model?
2007-03-05T13:37:00.000Z	Heavenquake	ompaul	This is a Fujitsu Siemens. Almost everything is wrong with this one. And durability is nonexistant.
2007-03-05T13:38:00.000Z	ompaul	Heavenquake	l
