2010-08-06T05:56:00.000Z	KE1HA		Do the the research "before" buying, saves allot fo trouble.
2010-08-06T05:57:00.000Z	petriborg1	KE1HA	- what wifi do you use, i could *really* use an easier to use pci-wifi card right now - my current one is completely fucked in 10.04
2010-08-06T06:03:00.000Z	petriborg1	KE1HA	- sorry maybe i missed it in the spue of chat, but did you say what wifi card you're using?
2010-08-07T03:56:00.000Z	KE1HA	petriborg1	did you do the install with the TV or a regular monitor ?
2010-08-07T03:56:00.000Z	petriborg1	KE1HA	- monitor
2010-08-07T03:57:00.000Z	KE1HA	petriborg1	I did that once as well, tried reconfiguring X-org, to no avail, found the soluton was to do the Install using the HDTV as the monitor. Great Res on a 60" Sony :-)
2010-08-07T03:58:00.000Z	petriborg1	KE1HA	i see, well i'll consider that if nothing else works i guess :-/
2010-08-07T03:59:00.000Z	KE1HA	petriborg1	I tried fer days, but there my be an X-Org guru here that may be able to sort it out.
2010-08-07T03:59:00.000Z	petriborg1	KE1HA	- SoldOut - i suppose the live CD saw the hdtv for you?
2010-08-07T04:00:00.000Z	petriborg1	KE1HA	- SoldOut -  I can hack xorg to bits, done it for years, would doing something like that work possibly?
2010-08-07T04:00:00.000Z	KE1HA	petriborg1	LiveCD, yes I did the Alternate Install and Desktop Installs. Was a bit off-center until the install finished, but other than that was ok.
2010-08-07T04:00:00.000Z	petriborg1	KE1HA	- SoldOut - i'm not using a live cd either, what i mean is, when you did the install connected to the hdtv, did the live cd see the hdtv?
2010-08-07T04:01:00.000Z	KE1HA	petriborg1	Yes, mine looked like a Giant Monitor basically.
2010-08-07T04:01:00.000Z	petriborg1	KE1HA	- SoldOut - hm ok
2010-08-07T04:01:00.000Z	petriborg1	KE1HA	- SoldOut - i'm going to go see if i can poke the gnome panel into showing me some monitor thing, biab
2010-08-07T04:02:00.000Z	KE1HA	petriborg1	I had to Select HDTV-xx1 or xx2 whatever on the TV, not the TV Selection.
2010-08-07T04:02:00.000Z	KE1HA	petriborg1	oops sri, not the PC selection I mean.
