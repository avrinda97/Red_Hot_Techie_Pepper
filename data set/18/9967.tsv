2007-12-01T20:19:00.000Z	stdin	berent	a list of trusted keys
2007-12-01T20:19:00.000Z	berent	stdin	what does that mean and where is it used
2007-12-01T20:20:00.000Z	stdin	berent	it's a list of GPG keys that are used to sign the list of packages from Ubuntu, for apt
2007-12-01T20:21:00.000Z	berent	stdin	if i create a newone what does that mean.
2007-12-01T20:22:00.000Z	stdin	berent	a personal ketring is a list of keys that you have stored locally, so you can verify that signed files are from who they claim to be from
2007-12-01T20:23:00.000Z	berent	stdin	how will it verify somebody else's signed files?
2007-12-01T20:24:00.000Z	stdin	berent	you get their public key from a keyserver (like keyserver.ubuntu.com) and then use gpg to see if the file has a correct signature
2007-12-01T20:25:00.000Z	berent	stdin	so you mean whoever creates a keyring will get an ancryption at some server which is retrieved at the time of verification of respective sources,
2007-12-01T20:27:00.000Z	stdin	berent	a keyring is just a list of public keys which you can use to check a files origin. they create the keypair (public and private) on their system an upload the public key to a server so you can check that a file has a good signature from them
2007-12-01T20:29:00.000Z	berent	stdin	does that mean someone can check for my public keyring value and verify it on all files i upload and download.
2007-12-01T20:31:00.000Z	stdin	berent	close, if you create a key an upload the public key to s keyserver, someone else can download that key to check that a file you have signed is really from you. it's also used in emails to make sure the email is really from the sender it says
2007-12-01T20:32:00.000Z	berent	stdin	how do you sign a document with a keyring?
2007-12-01T20:33:00.000Z	berent	stdin	i never sign anything when using email
2007-12-01T20:34:00.000Z	stdin	berent	this is a good guide on how to do that https://help.ubuntu.com/community/GnuPrivacyGuardHowto
2007-12-01T20:38:00.000Z	berent	stdin	thanks
