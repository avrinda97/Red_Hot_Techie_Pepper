2005-11-17T06:12:00.000Z	jilocasin		ubuntu's root system seems wonky
2005-11-17T06:12:00.000Z	jilocasin		is it possible to find out how to "fix" it?
2005-11-17T06:13:00.000Z	jilocasin		cafeugo: yep, just finished installing breezy as expert.  IT asked for a root password,
2005-11-17T06:13:00.000Z	erUSUL	jilocasin	i'm afraid that "wonky" does not describe the problem
2005-11-17T06:33:00.000Z	erUSUL	jilocasin	no it is not. not everbody is in the sudoers file only the admin of the machine.
2005-11-17T06:34:00.000Z	jilocasin	erUSUL	So if I want to run as a non-admin account, I have to have an admin account (in the admin group), my regular account, and root
2005-11-17T06:35:00.000Z	jilocasin	erUSUL	When I'm logged into as the regular account, I can't do any admining, unless I use the console.  Otherwise I have to log out and log back in as 'administrator'
2005-11-17T06:35:00.000Z	erUSUL	jilocasin	you do not need root. i do not use root.
2005-11-17T06:36:00.000Z	jilocasin	erUSUL	well, it won't let me check for updates without being admin, it won't let me look at the ntfs mounts without admin, it won't let me see the users/groups without being admin.... (that's what I've found out so far)
2005-11-17T06:36:00.000Z	erUSUL	jilocasin	is not a regular account as it is in the sudoers file. if you do not like it edit sudoers and delete the entry
2005-11-17T06:38:00.000Z	erUSUL	jilocasin	in ubuntu you have that the first account is admin and in sudoers file. the rest are normal users.
2005-11-17T06:38:00.000Z	erUSUL	jilocasin	sudo only works if you are in /etc/sudoers
2005-11-17T06:40:00.000Z	jilocasin	erUSUL	Second, none of the gnome admin tools work (with sudo) _unless_ you are running as an account (not root) that's in the admin group.
2005-11-17T06:41:00.000Z	jilocasin	erUSUL	If I normally use a non-admin account, then I have to logout and logback in as "administrator" (or ant account in the admin group)
2005-11-17T06:44:00.000Z	erUSUL	jilocasin	if i understand correctly you are complining becouse only users in admin group can admin the machine?
2005-11-17T06:46:00.000Z	erUSUL	jilocasin	but as an admin you are a normal user as long you do not use sudo, that's the point
2005-11-17T06:49:00.000Z	erUSUL	jilocasin	root account is not supported for secuity reasons. everythin you do with sudo is logged what you do as root in other linuxes is not
