2007-03-13T10:18:00.000Z	Thinkpad_Guru	Anabelle	you want to limit the speed?
2007-03-13T10:19:00.000Z	Thinkpad_Guru	Anabelle	please explain what you mean, why do you want to cap yourself?
2007-03-13T10:21:00.000Z	Thinkpad_Guru	Anabelle	can you limit the bandwidth with the program?
2007-03-13T10:24:00.000Z	Thinkpad_Guru	Anabelle	I really havn't come across a program like that.  I'm sure they are out there though.   Are you behind a router? Can you confure the router to cap your bandwidth to your PC?
2007-03-13T10:25:00.000Z	Thinkpad_Guru	Anabelle	your ISP has no control over your router. What kind of router is it? Linksys? Netgear?
2007-03-13T10:26:00.000Z	Thinkpad_Guru	Anabelle	you mean modem?
2007-03-13T10:28:00.000Z	Thinkpad_Guru	Anabelle	hmm, yeah a traffic shaper would be a suggestion, although I havnt ever played with one.
2007-03-13T10:29:00.000Z	Thinkpad_Guru	Anabelle	Yes
2007-03-13T10:33:00.000Z	Thinkpad_Guru	Anabelle	huh where are you at?
2007-03-13T10:34:00.000Z	Thinkpad_Guru	Anabelle	I mean geographically :)
2007-03-13T10:35:00.000Z	Thinkpad_Guru	Anabelle	guess coffee would mean not in the US. hehe
2007-03-13T10:41:00.000Z	Thinkpad_Guru	Anabelle	you may be burning them too fast try a slow speed like 4x
2007-03-13T10:48:00.000Z	Thinkpad_Guru	Anabelle	have a good nite
