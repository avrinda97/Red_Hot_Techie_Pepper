2005-06-20T07:47:00.000Z	JohnnyQuest		i keep getting MD5suem mismatch when installing qt3
2005-06-20T07:47:00.000Z	JohnnyQuest		can anyone help?
2005-06-20T07:48:00.000Z	eyequeue	JohnnyQuest	 sudo apt-get update, then run the command you used to install again
2005-06-20T07:48:00.000Z	eyequeue	JohnnyQuest	 what mirror are you using?
2005-06-20T07:49:00.000Z	eyequeue	JohnnyQuest	 the update command should fix the md5sum mismatch error for the repository itself (Packages.gz)
2005-06-20T07:51:00.000Z	eyequeue	JohnnyQuest	 try that, then sudo rm /var/cache/apt/archives/libjpeg62-dev_6b-9_i386.deb, then sudo apt-get install libjpeg62-dev
2005-06-20T07:51:00.000Z	eyequeue	JohnnyQuest	 just in case you have a bad deb d/l'd from earlier
2005-06-20T07:53:00.000Z	eyequeue	JohnnyQuest	 sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install libjpeg62-dev
2005-06-20T07:54:00.000Z	eyequeue	JohnnyQuest	 i have one more rm command for you if that doesn't fix it
2005-06-20T07:58:00.000Z	eyequeue	JohnnyQuest	 sudo rm /var/cache/apt/archives/libjpeg62*
2005-06-20T07:58:00.000Z	eyequeue	JohnnyQuest	then sudo apt-get install libjpeg62-dev
2005-06-20T08:00:00.000Z	eyequeue	JohnnyQuest	 are you comfortable editing a text file?
2005-06-20T08:00:00.000Z	eyequeue	JohnnyQuest	 well, you'll change all occurences of us.archive to just archive
2005-06-20T08:01:00.000Z	eyequeue	JohnnyQuest	but i can construct a single commandline to do it, if you need one
2005-06-20T08:01:00.000Z	eyequeue	JohnnyQuest	 /etc/apt/sources.list (you'll need sudo)
2005-06-20T08:02:00.000Z	eyequeue	JohnnyQuest	 sudo sed -e 's/us.archive/archive/' -i /etc/apt/sources.list
2005-06-20T08:03:00.000Z	eyequeue	JohnnyQuest	 that will make the changes to the file, then you will do this:
2005-06-20T08:03:00.000Z	eyequeue	JohnnyQuest	 sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install libjpeg62-dev
