2008-06-10T09:50:00.000Z	puff	simplechat	I was having some serious problems in that vein, which arose from my efforts to fix the problems caused by the kernel update about 6 days ago.
2008-06-10T09:51:00.000Z	simplechat	puff	hmmm, k. i tried and older kernel and it had the same issue
2008-06-10T09:52:00.000Z	puff	simplechat	I eventually slipped and accidentally did an aptitude full-upgrade after adding the hardy-proposed repository to my source.list.  It upgraded a ton of things, and now everything except the original wireless problem is back to normal.  Only I'm on hardy-proposed now, of course.
2008-06-10T09:52:00.000Z	simplechat	puff	ah
2008-06-10T09:53:00.000Z	puff	simplechat	I'm not sure what the deal is with hardy-proposed, but if it's anything like a dist-upgrade, then it's going to be hard/impossible to go backwards, so I'm either stuck on hardy-proposed or I reinstall from scratrch.
2008-06-10T09:55:00.000Z	puff	simplechat	Update or upgrade?
2008-06-10T09:55:00.000Z	puff	simplechat	update just updates apt's record of packages, shoudn't actually install anything.
2008-06-10T09:55:00.000Z	simplechat	puff	it was through the little update manager thing
2008-06-10T09:56:00.000Z	puff	simplechat	Ah, okay, that was equivalent to a full-upgrade.
