2006-08-20T08:47:00.000Z	sethk	snoops	yes
2006-08-20T08:47:00.000Z	sethk	snoops	sorry
2006-08-20T12:51:00.000Z	sethk	snoops	there is some free software that does it.  I forget the name at the moment but google should find it for you.
2006-08-22T11:56:00.000Z	sethk	snoops	that proves nothing.  the problems may be rare but they absolutely exist.  a web search will show you
2006-08-22T11:56:00.000Z	snoops	sethk	it proves I had no problems with it...gosh, you don't need to be a jerk
2006-09-03T11:48:00.000Z	sethk	snoops	if you don't want that to happen, look at the nohup command
2006-09-03T11:49:00.000Z	sethk	snoops	nohup separates programs from their owning terminals
2006-09-03T11:50:00.000Z	sethk	snoops	no.  that's what you usually do, but it can attach, I believe.  let me double check.
2006-09-03T11:51:00.000Z	sethk	snoops	looks like I was wrong about that.  there is a way to do it, though, let me look for it.
2006-09-03T11:52:00.000Z	sethk	snoops	you can start a new terminal, rather than restart.
2006-09-03T11:53:00.000Z	sethk	snoops	I use kde though, so I don't have the exact way to do it.  but it can certainly be done.
2006-09-03T11:53:00.000Z	snoops	sethk	umm that terminal crashed error occured when I tried to start a new terminal..
2006-09-03T11:54:00.000Z	sethk	snoops	yes, I see that.  there is a flag, though, that you can use, and you can start a terminal with the flag from one of the consoles (as in control-alt-f1 for first console, etc.)
2006-09-03T11:55:00.000Z	sethk	snoops	check the help.  another option is to start an xterm, or a konsole
2006-09-03T11:56:00.000Z	snoops	sethk	k, and no idea on switching a 'child process' of terminal from one parent to a different system.. then restart the parent I just swaped, then swap the child process back to the restarted terminal?
2006-09-03T11:57:00.000Z	sethk	snoops	I don't know, sorry.
2006-09-03T11:58:00.000Z	sethk	snoops	sorry I don't have a quick fix.  another strategy might be to start gnome-terminal with zsh instead of bash.
2006-09-03T11:58:00.000Z	sethk	snoops	again, though, I'm not sure whether this will impact gnome the way it does kde.
