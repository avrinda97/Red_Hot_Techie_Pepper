2008-01-21T04:03:00.000Z	trx		What's the latest news on the opensource ATI driver? does compiz work now?
2008-01-21T04:04:00.000Z	Cpudan80	trx	Yes it does
2008-01-21T04:06:00.000Z	trx	Cpudan80	Could you give me any pointers to a open source ATI driver specific howto/docs... as I have moved from fglrx to 'ati' and it's laggy/choppy as hell doing anything 3d... I have probably missed some options in xorg.conf... but everywhere i look for help, it's always talking about the flgrx drivers
2008-01-21T04:07:00.000Z	Cpudan80	trx	What are you running it with?
2008-01-21T04:07:00.000Z	Cpudan80	trx	It wasn't great when I tried it on my T42 Radeon 7500
2008-01-21T04:08:00.000Z	trx	Cpudan80	Laptop, radeon express 1100, but it works v well, perfect framerate with flgrx... but flgrx breaks suspend to ram :(
2008-01-21T04:08:00.000Z	Cpudan80	trx	hrm......
2008-01-21T04:08:00.000Z	Cpudan80	trx	if you do glxinfo | grep direct - does it say "Yes"
2008-01-21T04:09:00.000Z	trx	Cpudan80	It says no :)
2008-01-21T04:09:00.000Z	trx	Cpudan80	Good news i guess :) what Have i missed :P
2008-01-21T04:09:00.000Z	Cpudan80	trx	that's your problem
2008-01-21T04:10:00.000Z	Cpudan80	trx	paste your xorg.conf file to pastebin or something
2008-01-21T04:12:00.000Z	trx	Cpudan80	I want to use the open source drivers, was using the ati prop drivers before and they worked great, only it broke suspend to ram
2008-01-21T04:12:00.000Z	Cpudan80	trx	Well again, that's AMDs/ATis fault
2008-01-21T04:14:00.000Z	Cpudan80	trx	When that happened on my T42 running that sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg command helped
2008-01-21T04:15:00.000Z	Cpudan80	trx	back it up first
2008-01-21T04:15:00.000Z	trx	Cpudan80	That is a fresh config from a dpkg-reconfigure
2008-01-21T04:15:00.000Z	Cpudan80	trx	hrm....
