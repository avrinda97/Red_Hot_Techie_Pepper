2005-08-30T11:09:00.000Z	eros		Yeah, the ones in the wiki
2005-08-30T11:09:00.000Z	eros		hello rober90 :)
2005-08-30T11:10:00.000Z	eros		do i need to mount other pc's ?
2005-08-30T11:10:00.000Z	eros		I don't see any other network clients at all
2005-08-30T11:11:00.000Z	batoms	eros	try smbclient -L //hostname where hostname is the name of the host your trying to connect to
2005-08-30T11:16:00.000Z	eros	batoms	do i need to put smb:// before that ?
2005-08-30T11:16:00.000Z	batoms	eros	not if you mean on the smbclient command
2005-08-30T11:17:00.000Z	batoms	eros	smbclient -L //hostname should tell you if you can connect to the host and if you can what shares are available
2005-08-30T11:19:00.000Z	batoms	eros	its probably a smb.conf problem
2005-08-30T11:20:00.000Z	batoms	eros	type 'testparm' first and make sure you don't have any errors in smb.conf
2005-08-30T11:22:00.000Z	batoms	eros	do you know the IP address of the machine you are trying to connect to
2005-08-30T11:22:00.000Z	batoms	eros	if so can you ping it
