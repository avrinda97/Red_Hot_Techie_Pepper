2011-10-26T02:37:00.000Z	blackbuntu		perfect odin..how can i find certain words within a man page...say i wanted to find the words -iname in the man page how can i do that..my guess is using grep but how could u go about that
2011-10-26T02:38:00.000Z	odin_	blackbuntu	mean how to use "less" and read "man less"
2011-10-26T02:39:00.000Z	odin_	blackbuntu	basic search is started with a "/" key and type in part of the match press return, so "/iname<return>"
2011-10-26T02:41:00.000Z	blackbuntu		odin aaahh excellent /iname worked great..how long have u been using linux for?
