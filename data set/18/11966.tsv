2006-12-02T09:44:00.000Z	klees		does anyone know if there's a bug setting system sounds under System->Preferences->Sound ??
2006-12-02T09:45:00.000Z	klees		i've set sounds for all the events and i don't hear them except for login and logout
2006-12-02T09:45:00.000Z	davor	klees	can you hear mp3's etc?
2006-12-02T09:46:00.000Z	klees	davor	yes i can
2006-12-02T09:46:00.000Z	davor	klees	are the other sound events pointing to a sound file? have you selected what file to play?
2006-12-02T09:49:00.000Z	davor	klees	perhaps there's a log-file in /var/log that can help you?
2006-12-02T09:49:00.000Z	klees	davor	i'll check that.  the funny thing is i can play any sound i select for an event but when the event occurs it doesn't play the sound
2006-12-02T09:50:00.000Z	davor	klees	yeah, i think what you need to find out first is exactly where the problem occurs. is it that it tries to play the sound and that it doesn't work, or is it having trouble sensing the event. it might even be that the configuration program actually isn't writing what you want it to, to the conf-file.
2006-12-02T09:51:00.000Z	klees	davor	correct but that's where my limited knowledge halts =(
2006-12-02T09:53:00.000Z	klees	davor	no luck
2006-12-02T09:53:00.000Z	klees	davor	i'm under Edgy btw
2006-12-02T09:53:00.000Z	klees	davor	it used to work fine in Dapper
2006-12-02T09:54:00.000Z	davor	klees	hmm.. frankly I have no idea. it doesn't sound like a sound-problem, tough. i would guess that it has to do with the conf-file.
2006-12-02T09:54:00.000Z	klees	davor	do u know where the conf-file is?
2006-12-02T09:55:00.000Z	davor	klees	what is the program called that you are trying to alter? i would guess that it's somewhere under .gnome2
2006-12-02T09:56:00.000Z	klees	davor	gnome-sound-properties
2006-12-02T09:57:00.000Z	davor	klees	check this out, it's a pretty long thread tough. http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=205449
2006-12-02T09:58:00.000Z	klees	davor	will do.  i appreciate ur help
