2008-03-23T16:48:00.000Z	zepolen		where is the default codec location for xubuntu 7.10?
2008-03-23T16:49:00.000Z	unop	zepolen	it depends on the codecs -- the location for w32codecs would be /usr/lib/win32
2008-03-23T16:50:00.000Z	zepolen	unop	and to get the w32codecs?
2008-03-23T16:53:00.000Z	zepolen	unop	totem wants cook.so - there is a cook.so in /usr/lib/win32 and it still cant see it
2008-03-23T16:54:00.000Z	unop	zepolen	install w32codecs .. that way, the codecs are registered and your players can utilize them
2008-03-23T16:55:00.000Z	zepolen	unop	i am not allowed to use medibuntu
2008-03-23T16:55:00.000Z	unop	zepolen	why not?
2008-03-23T16:55:00.000Z	zepolen	unop	no changes to sources.list
2008-03-23T16:57:00.000Z	unop	zepolen	nothing wrong -- but have a read here - http://www.mplayerhq.hu/design7/dload.html
2008-03-23T16:58:00.000Z	zepolen	unop	i have read that - but have no idea which path the mplayer package on ubuntu was --configured with
2008-03-23T16:59:00.000Z	unop	zepolen	chances are that if you have no write access over /etc/apt/sources.list, you also have no access to place codecs in /usr/lib/win32  .. do you have write access to that directory?
2008-03-23T16:59:00.000Z	unop	zepolen	mplayer codecs go in /usr/lib/win32
2008-03-23T17:00:00.000Z	zepolen	unop	totem doesnt see the cook.so it complains about which is in /usr/lib/win32
2008-03-23T17:01:00.000Z	unop	zepolen	cook.so might have other dependencies that are not available, which is why i suggested you install the package in the first place -- but you dont seem to be answering the questions i ask, so i'm not sure how i can really help you.
2008-03-23T17:08:00.000Z	zepolen	unop	fyi, /usr/lib/codecs is the default location for mplayer on ubuntu 7.10
2008-03-23T17:08:00.000Z	unop	zepolen	 /usr/lib/codecs is sometimes a link to /usr/lib/win32  or vice-versa
2008-03-23T17:09:00.000Z	zepolen	unop	neither was on my system
2008-03-23T17:09:00.000Z	unop	zepolen	you need to install the various codec packages to have them created -- but we've been past that already
