2011-06-04T09:54:00.000Z	Alexhans		tried chmod but it does nothing
2011-06-04T09:55:00.000Z	teegee	Alexhans	is it mounted 'noexec'?
2011-06-04T09:56:00.000Z	teegee	Alexhans	type mount and look for options in brackets
2011-06-04T09:58:00.000Z	teegee	Alexhans	why do you keep linux executables on an ntfs partition anyway?
2011-06-04T09:59:00.000Z	teegee	Alexhans	what error do you get when you try to run it?
2011-06-04T10:02:00.000Z	teegee	Alexhans	bash scripts which are located on that ntfs partition or any bash scripts?
2011-06-04T10:06:00.000Z	teegee	Alexhans	I don't know much about java
2011-06-04T10:06:00.000Z	teegee	Alexhans	you shouldn't write to a ntfs partition
2011-06-04T10:14:00.000Z	teegee	Alexhans	no copying back
2011-06-04T10:15:00.000Z	teegee	Alexhans	surely the application doesn't change very often
2011-06-04T10:17:00.000Z	teegee	Alexhans	can you create a file in that folder?
2011-06-04T10:18:00.000Z	teegee	Alexhans	660 doesn't necessarily mean that you can write
2011-06-04T10:19:00.000Z	teegee	Alexhans	you need 5 or 7 for execute
2011-06-04T10:20:00.000Z	Alexhans	teegee	, nothing
2011-06-04T10:22:00.000Z	teegee	Alexhans	no error and the permissions don't change?
2011-06-04T10:23:00.000Z	teegee	Alexhans	you could copy the executable in a folder on your linux partition and symlink all the other files in
2011-06-04T10:27:00.000Z	teegee	Alexhans	manual mount is easy, just use the fmask option
2011-06-04T10:29:00.000Z	teegee	Alexhans	if you haven't used it for anything else and don't want to use it again, aptitude purge samba will do
