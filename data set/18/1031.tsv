2011-06-26T23:46:00.000Z	orwhatt		one last question, what would you think about using 2.6.21 (ubuntu kernel dont remember the release) and the iptables version of its release as hardware router? would it be good even though its outdated?
2011-06-26T23:48:00.000Z	wols	orwhatt	no it would be bad
2011-06-26T23:48:00.000Z	orwhatt	wols	mind if i ask you why it would be bad?
2011-06-26T23:49:00.000Z	wols	orwhatt	cause it's not made for a router at all and very outdated and by now pretty certainly prone to exploits
2011-06-26T23:49:00.000Z	orwhatt	wols	my actual router uses 2.6.20 (although not ubuntu i386) do i have to worry? lol
2011-06-26T23:50:00.000Z	wols	orwhatt	no. cause the vendor of your router might (and should have) patched it properly. the ubuntu one is by now probably !EOL and not patched anymore. also ubuntu is a general purpose distro. router distros are differently made
2011-06-26T23:51:00.000Z	orwhatt	wols	vendor is linksys and they have last patched it in march 2010, you still say i can sleep tight?
2011-06-26T23:51:00.000Z	wols	orwhatt	basically, you can run ubuntu as a "hardware router", but if you have to ask about it, you really shouldn't do it
2011-06-26T23:52:00.000Z	wols	orwhatt	I don't know how linksys makes their router but you can sleep better than with a ubuntu install from 2010 as a router imho
2011-06-26T23:54:00.000Z	wols	orwhatt	what is the reason you want to use ubuntu for a router? just for routing alone, it can't be?
2011-06-26T23:55:00.000Z	orwhatt	wols	just for routing yeah, thought i may have a better control of it if i wasnt bound to the manufacturer
2011-06-26T23:56:00.000Z	wols	orwhatt	if you want that buy a cheap openwrt compatible router. your ubuntu router will probably cost more electricity in a year than such a dedicated small routerbox
2011-06-26T23:56:00.000Z	orwhatt	wols	that makes alot of sence thanks
2011-06-26T23:57:00.000Z	wols	orwhatt	WR1043ND is very cheap, runs openwrt
2011-06-26T23:58:00.000Z	orwhatt	wols	ill look it up thanks
2011-06-27T00:00:00.000Z	wols	orwhatt	in europe there are. fritz!box by avm. it's a phonesystem, dsl modem and router. runs linux and has free firmware available via freetz and some very select models via openwrt
2011-06-27T00:00:00.000Z	orwhatt	wols	ill have to check amazon for that, shops dont seem to have lol
2011-06-27T00:02:00.000Z	orwhatt	wols	you too
