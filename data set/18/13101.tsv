2006-06-19T07:37:00.000Z	Discipulus		Alright I've been having problems with hardware on my Ubuntu System for like the past couple of days can you people help me or not?
2006-06-19T07:38:00.000Z	Discipulus		Alright, well, first it isn't detecting my camera, so I'm giving up on it
2006-06-19T07:38:00.000Z	Discipulus		Then, it didn't detect my new CD Burner
2006-06-19T07:38:00.000Z	Discipulus		and I gave up on that
2006-06-19T07:38:00.000Z	Discipulus		and now
2006-06-19T07:38:00.000Z	Discipulus		my printer isn't working
2006-06-19T07:38:00.000Z	Discipulus		although it previously has
2006-06-19T07:38:00.000Z	Discipulus		and I don't see anything in the menus about hardware
2006-06-19T07:39:00.000Z	Discipulus		so, question: How do I get my printer to work?
2006-06-19T07:39:00.000Z	Discipulus		under Menu->Accessories->Printer Manager it says the state of the printer is "Stopped"
2006-06-19T07:40:00.000Z	nosklo	Discipulus	What is your printer? Are you using which version of ubuntu?
2006-06-19T07:40:00.000Z	nosklo	Discipulus	your printer is supported
2006-06-19T07:40:00.000Z	nosklo	Discipulus	are you using ubuntu, kubuntu or xubuntu?
2006-06-19T07:41:00.000Z	nosklo	Discipulus	oh, this is the one I dont have here :( Try to find an "Add printer" dialog
2006-06-19T07:41:00.000Z	nosklo	Discipulus	or run "sudo gnome-cups-add"
2006-06-19T07:43:00.000Z	nosklo	Discipulus	run sudo gnome-cups-manager
2006-06-19T07:43:00.000Z	nosklo	Discipulus	then right click printer and choose "start"
2006-06-19T07:46:00.000Z	Discipulus	nosklo	I resumed the printer and tried to print but the printer said no
