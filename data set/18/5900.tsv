2008-08-04T13:57:00.000Z	tauren	DozedOnLinux	 ok, i'm checking through the output of those commands now.
2008-08-04T13:58:00.000Z	tauren	DozedOnLinux	 nothing in sudo lspci
2008-08-04T13:58:00.000Z	tauren	DozedOnLinux	 how do I use the other command?  It shows output, but all on one line, and then when done the new command prompt replaces the same line.
2008-08-04T13:59:00.000Z	tauren	DozedOnLinux	 ok, thanks.
2008-08-04T13:59:00.000Z	tauren	DozedOnLinux	 yes, that one.
2008-08-04T14:04:00.000Z	tauren	DozedOnLinux	 a grep of /etc/modprobe.d/alias has no "wlan", "eth", or "wifi" in it.

2008-08-04T14:06:00.000Z	tauren	DozedOnLinux	 ok, thanks for helping troubleshoot.  that is actually what i was thinking too.
