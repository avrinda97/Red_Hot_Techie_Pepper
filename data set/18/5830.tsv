2008-08-17T14:01:00.000Z	alistair	php6th	no thats too major, all thats needed is to restore some settings back as before (besides I hate Norton)
2008-08-17T14:02:00.000Z	php6th	alistair	settings? whats that
2008-08-17T14:03:00.000Z	php6th	alistair	apt-restore previous-state 04
2008-08-17T14:03:00.000Z	alistair	php6th	so on boot I type 'apt-restore previous-state 04' is that correct?
2008-08-17T14:04:00.000Z	php6th	alistair	no thats not correct, jsut im getting your idea
2008-08-17T14:04:00.000Z	php6th	alistair	there is no such thing
2008-08-17T14:05:00.000Z	php6th	alistair	you cant restore states... switch to IMac i heard they have a pansy flower restore system
2008-08-17T14:05:00.000Z	alistair	php6th	OK I have backed up using Simple Backup Config. But seems a bit after the fact if you cannot get back to desktop
2008-08-17T14:10:00.000Z	php6th	alistair	are you suggesting Ubuntu should be a copy of Windows?
2008-08-17T14:11:00.000Z	alistair	php6th	not at all, and I would hate that, but there are just a few good things in windows that I'm used to
2008-08-17T14:11:00.000Z	php6th	alistair	dont use backups, thats weak, learn to config and mantain your system, voila!
