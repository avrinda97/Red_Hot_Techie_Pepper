2005-08-12T13:16:00.000Z	JDahl	piksi	sometimes changing BIOS settings will help
2005-08-12T13:17:00.000Z	piksi	JDahl	there are only User / Other Atapi / Auto for hdd and dvd drives, only dma/pio transfer modes can be changed :-<
2005-08-12T13:20:00.000Z	JDahl	piksi	does Linux freeze during boot with kernel panic? I've had my shares of related problems
2005-08-12T13:21:00.000Z	piksi	JDahl	knoppix 4.0 works perfectly immediately with both dvd boot and hdd install, but with ubuntu 5.04 and debian sarge installers they just fuckup
2005-08-12T13:21:00.000Z	piksi	JDahl	debian claims it cannot find any hdd or partitions and ubuntu says it cannot find cd-rom
2005-08-12T13:23:00.000Z	JDahl	piksi	there's something broken with SATA support in the ramdisk image on Debian
2005-08-12T13:23:00.000Z	piksi	JDahl	oh, can anything be done to fix it?
2005-08-12T13:25:00.000Z	JDahl	piksi	someone more informed than me tried to guide me through it, but I eventually gave up. You have to rebuild the ramdisk image, and be more generous with amount the of SATA related modules you load
2005-08-12T13:26:00.000Z	piksi	JDahl	ok, thanks anyway :-)
2005-08-12T13:27:00.000Z	JDahl	piksi	in short, with the stock version, not all modules are loaded
2005-08-12T13:28:00.000Z	piksi	JDahl	i tried loading all sort of sata modules during installer bootup from a second console but apparently they were wrong or not enough :-/
2005-08-12T13:28:00.000Z	JDahl	piksi	the installation is normally fine... it's the installed ramdisk than doesnt load all the modules you need
2005-08-12T13:28:00.000Z	JDahl	piksi	(I think)
2005-08-12T13:29:00.000Z	piksi	JDahl	oh well... so apparently i need to wait for a new release? :-/ (since i'm not a master in tweaking the system)
2005-08-12T13:30:00.000Z	JDahl	piksi	for me the installation always worked, but all subsequent boots would freeze with kernel panic... the bad news is that it's a well-documented critical bug, that people apparently doesnt care about
2005-08-12T13:31:00.000Z	piksi	JDahl	since knoppix works perfectly and is debian based ... can i assume debian and ubuntu would too after installation?
2005-08-12T13:32:00.000Z	JDahl	piksi	it depends on the hardware, I think..
2005-08-12T13:35:00.000Z	piksi	JDahl	ok, thanks...
