2011-03-28T10:56:00.000Z	truepurple		Anyone here have any special instructions for installing flash on ubuntu 10.10 64 bit?
2011-03-28T10:57:00.000Z	grindcrusher	truepurple	open synaptic and check "flashplugin-installer", that works for me
2011-03-28T10:58:00.000Z	truepurple	grindcrusher	How do I open this synpatic?
2011-03-28T10:59:00.000Z	grindcrusher		system->administration->synaptic package manager
2011-03-28T10:59:00.000Z	grindcrusher		bah too slow
2011-03-28T11:00:00.000Z	truepurple		I can't open synpatics, it wants a root password thingy and I havent set up that yet, I don't know how
2011-03-28T11:00:00.000Z	grindcrusher		use your password
2011-03-28T11:00:00.000Z	grindcrusher		sudo
2011-03-28T11:01:00.000Z	grindcrusher	truepurple	when it opens search for 'flash' and scroll down
2011-03-28T11:02:00.000Z	truepurple	grindcrusher	it rejects the password I use to login, like before
2011-03-28T11:03:00.000Z	grindcrusher	truepurple	you have other issues then
2011-03-28T11:04:00.000Z	truepurple	grindcrusher	I am told I need to go in and establish a password for the root or adminstration or whatever, but I don't know how to do that
2011-03-28T11:06:00.000Z	grindcrusher	truepurple	do you log in with a password at all?
2011-03-28T11:07:00.000Z	truepurple	grindcrusher	Yes
2011-03-28T11:08:00.000Z	grindcrusher	truepurple	then that password should work, if not, I don't know where to direct you, maybe someone else does
2011-03-28T11:16:00.000Z	truepurple		Can someone help me install flash please?
2011-03-28T11:17:00.000Z	grindcrusher	truepurple	you need to solve that password issue first
2011-03-28T11:18:00.000Z	truepurple	grindcrusher	I need to establish a password for that administrator side or something, but you don't seem to know anything about that. Anyway other methods don't require that
