2012-04-14T12:54:00.000Z	savr		where is xorg.conf located on a ubuntu system?
2012-04-14T12:55:00.000Z	savr		oh
2012-04-14T12:55:00.000Z	savr		where can I put synclient settings I want enabled by default?
2012-04-14T12:57:00.000Z	savr		who are the idiots who think unity is for tablets?
2012-04-14T12:58:00.000Z	savr		you don't put menus in tablets like how unity has them
2012-04-14T12:58:00.000Z	savr		unity is great
2012-04-14T12:58:00.000Z	savr		can't believe I didn't try it out earlier
2012-04-14T12:59:00.000Z	goddard	savr	try awn with unity
2012-04-14T13:00:00.000Z	goddard	savr	well most the apps are open you could make a wrapper for developers
2012-04-14T13:01:00.000Z	savr	goddard	it should be there by default. everything else is perfect out of the box
2012-04-14T13:04:00.000Z	savr	goddard	anything I can find about AVN is pre-unity
2012-04-14T13:04:00.000Z	goddard	savr	i install it fine try apt-cache search
2012-04-14T13:05:00.000Z	savr	goddard	I want to know wtf it is
2012-04-14T13:05:00.000Z	goddard	savr	it is
2012-04-14T13:05:00.000Z	goddard	savr	i guess
2012-04-14T13:05:00.000Z	goddard	savr	one thing i cant stand about it though is the dock doesn't minimize apps when you click the icon
2012-04-14T13:06:00.000Z	savr	goddard	ummm? that is what makes it sooo perfect. I use multiple workspaces
