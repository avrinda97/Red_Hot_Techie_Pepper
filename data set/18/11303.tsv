2006-10-23T14:31:00.000Z	variant	mnepton	yeah you can install 32bit versions in chroot
2006-11-07T15:07:00.000Z	mnepton	variant	i have been whining at Ben about that this week
2006-11-07T15:08:00.000Z	variant	mnepton	the option is there to recompile the kernel your self, if your that concerned that much about performance then recompiling is the only way to go
2006-11-07T15:09:00.000Z	mnepton	variant	my concern is more for end users that want best performance without having to recompile,
2006-11-07T15:09:00.000Z	variant	mnepton	try a test your self, the difference is negligable. much better to free up developer time for somthing that is more worth while (fixing bugs)
2006-11-17T11:15:00.000Z	mnepton	variant	that's ... uhhh ... i ... uhhh ... whatever ...
2006-11-17T11:15:00.000Z	variant	mnepton	that's ... uhh.. an opinion.. if you dont like it tough :)
2006-11-17T11:16:00.000Z	mnepton	variant	then express it as such.
2006-11-17T11:17:00.000Z	mnepton	variant	my opinion is that if you think Gentoo compiles with --teach-me-linux then you're on crack.
2006-11-17T11:17:00.000Z	variant	mnepton	whats gentoo got to do with learning "linux"?
2006-11-17T11:18:00.000Z	mnepton	variant	[00:14:38]  <variant> squidly: use slackware or gentoo if you want to mess around like that. ubuntu sucks for anyone wanting to actualy learn  <--- what am i missing?
2006-11-17T11:19:00.000Z	variant	mnepton	what is your problem? you get out of bed the wrong side or somthing? I am entitled to my opinion as are you
2006-11-17T11:19:00.000Z	mnepton	variant	"use Gentoo because Ubuntu sucks if you want to learn Linux. not that using Gentoo has anything to do with learning Linux." seems to be what you're saying. and when called on it, you start the personal jibes. really stellar.
2006-11-17T11:21:00.000Z	variant	mnepton	for a start, i didnt say "linux" that being hte kernel. and imo, gentoo _is_ good if you want to learn to be familiar with the command line as it makes much more effort to make people comfertable in this environment whereas ubuntu activly trys to stop people having to use the command line
2006-11-17T11:21:00.000Z	variant	mnepton	feel free to have the last word. i hate pointless arguments like this
2006-11-17T11:21:00.000Z	mnepton	variant	do you think a Linux that forces people to "emerge everything_useful" stands a snowball's chance in hell in fixing Bug #1?
2006-11-17T11:23:00.000Z	mnepton	variant	99% of users have no idea what a kernel is, never mind an interest in compiling one. if you're intrigued enough to try to compile your own kernel, you can do it on Ubuntu as easily as on Gentoo.
