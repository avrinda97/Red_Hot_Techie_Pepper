2012-03-28T00:50:00.000Z	xananax		Hello
2012-03-28T00:50:00.000Z	xananax		I have that USB that does not work (hangs on safely remove)
2012-03-28T00:51:00.000Z	xananax		After trying a lot of things, I was able to make it work with sudo mount -o remount,async /dev/sda1
2012-03-28T00:51:00.000Z	xananax		so basically mounting it in sync mode
2012-03-28T00:51:00.000Z	xananax		Can I edit my fstab to add an entry for this usb and have it always mounted in sync?
2012-03-28T00:52:00.000Z	gmachine_24	xananax	- will it always be plugged in?
2012-03-28T00:52:00.000Z	xananax		no, it's a usb thumb drive
2012-03-28T00:52:00.000Z	gmachine_24		ask questions first, grasshopper. then give answers. :)
2012-03-28T00:52:00.000Z	xananax	DJ	I would just enter the command every time, no prob, but it's an MP3 player that my mother has just bought
2012-03-28T00:53:00.000Z	xananax		if I remove nautilus automatic mount
2012-03-28T00:53:00.000Z	xananax		she's gonna have problems
2012-03-28T00:54:00.000Z	gmachine_24		mount an mp3 player, I think
2012-03-28T00:54:00.000Z	xananax		I am just trying to get this to work in a "normal" manner for my mother to prevent her from switching back to windows
2012-03-28T00:54:00.000Z	xananax		she just bought an mp3 player
2012-03-28T00:54:00.000Z	xananax		and it won't sync
2012-03-28T00:54:00.000Z	gmachine_24		what kind of mp3 player
2012-03-28T00:54:00.000Z	xananax		Basically a usb with a fat32 system
