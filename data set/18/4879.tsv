2009-01-22T21:44:00.000Z	unused_bagels		hey guys, it's me again.  I'm having more problems with DELUGE
2009-01-22T21:46:00.000Z	unused_bagels		deluge tells me "NO INCOMING CONNECTIONS!
2009-01-22T21:47:00.000Z	facepalm_	unused_bagels	are you on a college campus?
2009-01-22T21:48:00.000Z	unused_bagels	facepalm_	 no I'm at home, and never had port forwarding issues till I switched to linucks
2009-01-22T21:48:00.000Z	facepalm_	unused_bagels	it's possible your ISP started to ban p2p traffic
2009-01-22T21:49:00.000Z	unused_bagels	facepalm_	 is there a way to find out?
2009-01-22T21:49:00.000Z	unused_bagels	facepalm_	because my ports aren't forwarding like they should, no matter what number i use
2009-01-22T21:49:00.000Z	facepalm_	unused_bagels	have you tried enabling protocol encryption? If I were you I would force encryption upstream and downstream
2009-01-22T21:50:00.000Z	unused_bagels	facepalm_	already ahead of you on that.
2009-01-22T21:50:00.000Z	facepalm_	unused_bagels	are you sure it's not just the torrent you are trying to download?
2009-01-22T21:50:00.000Z	unused_bagels	facepalm_	and no, that doesn't help.
2009-01-22T21:51:00.000Z	unused_bagels	facepalm_	i GET BETTER SPEEDS ON OTHER TORRENTS, BUT IT STILL SAYS NO CONNECTIONS
2009-01-22T21:53:00.000Z	facepalm_	unused_bagels	I am not sure, I've had this problem before. This is really a silly solution but when I switched to the newest Azureus all my problems went away. I really like Deluge and Azureus is bloated as hell but for some reason Azureus works and Deluge (and other clients) do not
2009-01-22T21:53:00.000Z	unused_bagels	facepalm_	people keep telling me that.  I really hated azureus
2009-01-22T21:54:00.000Z	facepalm_	unused_bagels	I do too, lol. For some reason they have a better encryption scheme or something, I have no idea. It's the only way I can get around my ISP deep packet inspection to torrent
2009-01-22T21:54:00.000Z	unused_bagels	facepalm_	ok, thanks.  I'll give it a go.
2009-01-22T21:55:00.000Z	facepalm_	unused_bagels	go to azureus.com not vuze.com, they made a new stand-alone torrent client
2009-01-22T21:55:00.000Z	facepalm_	unused_bagels	that I think is less bloated than the entire vuze crap
