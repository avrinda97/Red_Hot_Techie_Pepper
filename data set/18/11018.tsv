2007-12-21T07:04:00.000Z	wols_	l21logan99	there are errors
2007-12-21T07:05:00.000Z	wols_	l21logan99	you can't seem to make proper problem descriptions either
2007-12-21T07:13:00.000Z	wols_	l21logan99	either you show us the errors you get or you fix your own problems. your choice
2007-12-21T07:15:00.000Z	wols_	l21logan99	what howto do you use?
2007-12-21T07:30:00.000Z	wols_	l21logan99	what firmware binary did you get from the extraction? and where did you copy it?
2007-12-21T07:31:00.000Z	wols_	l21logan99	was that file created by the extraction?
2007-12-21T07:31:00.000Z	wols_	l21logan99	what file DID you get from extraction?
2007-12-21T07:32:00.000Z	wols_	l21logan99	you need to copy one of them to /lib/firmware. possibly all of them
2007-12-21T07:34:00.000Z	wols_	l21logan99	yes in /lib/firmware. then you modprobe -r your bcm43xx and modprobe it again to load it. then you should have an interface for it which you can configure
2007-12-21T07:35:00.000Z	wols_	l21logan99	do NOT paste in here!
2007-12-21T07:35:00.000Z	wols_	l21logan99	modprobe
2007-12-21T07:38:00.000Z	wols_	l21logan99	no
2007-12-21T07:42:00.000Z	wols_	l21logan99	modprobe -r bcm43xx
2007-12-21T07:43:00.000Z	wols_	l21logan99	I did not. "modprobe -r"  is not "modprobe"
2007-12-21T08:15:00.000Z	wols_	l21logan99	what you are doing. using your brain once in a while really helps
2007-12-21T08:16:00.000Z	wols_	l21logan99	sudo mpdprobe -r bcm43xx"
2007-12-21T08:19:00.000Z	wols_	l21logan99	ifocnfig down the interface it currently provide. or simply reboot
2007-12-21T08:19:00.000Z	wols_	l21logan99	for you, a reboot is easier me thinks
