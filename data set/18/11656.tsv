2006-06-28T05:52:00.000Z	Slaryn		No nothing comes up, CarlFX
2006-06-28T05:52:00.000Z	Slaryn		And I don't know about my DNS settings :p
2006-06-28T05:53:00.000Z	Slaryn		It's on DHCP, I know that
2006-06-28T05:53:00.000Z	Slaryn		Static IP kills the whole thing
2006-06-28T05:53:00.000Z	Slaryn		Oh, sorry.  ;)
2006-06-28T05:55:00.000Z	Slaryn		How should I set it?
2006-06-28T05:56:00.000Z	Slaryn		CarlFX something about this doesn't seem right: Received packets: 93441, Reception errors: 32927
2006-06-28T05:56:00.000Z	Slaryn		:/
2006-06-28T05:57:00.000Z	biscon	Slaryn	have you tried requestion a new lease from the DHCP server?
2006-06-28T05:57:00.000Z	Slaryn	biscon	no, how do I do that?
2006-06-28T06:39:00.000Z	biscon	Slaryn	if_ath_g <-- do you have this when you do lsmod?
2006-06-28T06:41:00.000Z	biscon	Slaryn	ath_hal <-- perhaps? :)
2006-06-28T06:46:00.000Z	Slaryn	biscon	what should I be looking for under ath_hal/ath_pci?
2006-06-28T06:47:00.000Z	biscon	Slaryn	well I wasn't here from the start and I don't know what the problem is with your wifi.. but far as I can read from Carl's responses he did want you to unload your current drivers and load the new ones right?
2006-06-28T06:48:00.000Z	biscon	Slaryn	okay to follow his advice you should then rmmod the old drivers and ismod or modprobe the new ones
2006-06-28T06:48:00.000Z	biscon	Slaryn	thats what he said before right before he left :)
