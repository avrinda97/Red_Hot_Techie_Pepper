2008-11-05T19:02:00.000Z	Ubuntu_		any idea, how soon is the next patch for 8.10 going to come out fixing the most common issues?
2008-11-05T19:03:00.000Z	ziroday	Ubuntu_	there are no "patches" for non-lts releases, you have to wait till jaunty or get a normal update
2008-11-05T19:03:00.000Z	Ubuntu_	ziroday	so how do I get a normal update for 8.10
2008-11-05T19:04:00.000Z	ziroday	Ubuntu_	through the update manager, if you have an internet connection it will appear in the top right and tell you when there are updates.
2008-11-05T19:04:00.000Z	Ubuntu_	ziroday	I got a kernel update which I installed.
2008-11-05T19:04:00.000Z	ziroday	Ubuntu_	okay
2008-11-05T19:05:00.000Z	Ubuntu_	ziroday	8.10 has got several issues (see the forums)
2008-11-05T19:05:00.000Z	ziroday	Ubuntu_	I understand that
2008-11-05T19:05:00.000Z	ziroday	Ubuntu_	possibly, possibly not. The best thing to do is track or report a bug regarding your issue
2008-11-05T19:07:00.000Z	ziroday	Ubuntu_	you can update to OO.O3 in hardy as well
2008-11-05T19:08:00.000Z	Ubuntu_	ziroday	I heard that the upgrade is not available via package manager.
2008-11-05T19:08:00.000Z	ziroday	Ubuntu_	nope, you have to use an externel repo
2008-11-05T19:09:00.000Z	Ubuntu_	ziroday	is that a risk?
2008-11-05T19:09:00.000Z	ziroday	Ubuntu_	yes
2008-11-05T19:09:00.000Z	Ubuntu_	ziroday	so what is the other method?
2008-11-05T19:10:00.000Z	ziroday	Ubuntu_	through an externel repo. one sec
2008-11-05T19:11:00.000Z	ziroday	Ubuntu_	see here to get openoffice.org 3 https://launchpad.net/~openoffice-pkgs/+archive
