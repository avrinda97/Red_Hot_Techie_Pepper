2007-04-26T09:10:00.000Z	Enverex	jandro	What are you using to play it with?
2007-04-26T09:10:00.000Z	jandro	Enverex	just totem, playing the sample video "experiencing ubuntu.ogg" that comes with ubuntu
2007-04-26T09:19:00.000Z	jandro	Enverex	did you get any idea about my issue?
2007-04-26T09:19:00.000Z	Enverex	jandro	I asked what you're using to try and play the files...

2007-04-26T09:20:00.000Z	jandro	Enverex	in feisty fawn
2007-04-26T09:20:00.000Z	Enverex	jandro	No idea then, that's a bit odd with the video drivers installed :/
2007-04-26T09:20:00.000Z	jandro	Enverex	so...it is a problem of the nvidia drivers, or it's a problem of codecs?
2007-04-26T09:21:00.000Z	Enverex	jandro	You could try updating to the 100.xx.xx nVidia drivers and see if that helps
2007-04-26T09:21:00.000Z	jandro	Enverex	ok, thanks, i'll try
