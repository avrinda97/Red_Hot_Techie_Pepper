2005-09-23T08:19:00.000Z	tucoz		Hi, I am looking for a media-player plugin for firefox. Kaffeine-plugin crashes firefox occasionally.
2005-09-23T08:19:00.000Z	BlueEagle	tucoz	mplayer works as far as I know.
2005-09-23T08:20:00.000Z	tucoz	BlueEagle	ok, I might try that. But the commandline mplayer stutters on sound playback. Don't know what causes that, except that it has something to do with alsa.
2005-09-23T08:20:00.000Z	BlueEagle	tucoz	set -ao oss to cure that.
2005-09-23T08:20:00.000Z	BlueEagle	tucoz	atleast that is what fixed it for me.
2005-09-23T08:21:00.000Z	tucoz	BlueEagle	ok, thanks
2005-09-23T08:21:00.000Z	BlueEagle	tucoz	unless you've disabled esd then alsa should (in theory) work well.
2005-09-23T08:22:00.000Z	BlueEagle	tucoz	To find out have a look-see in the miltimedia system selector in System->Administration
2005-09-23T08:22:00.000Z	tucoz	BlueEagle	yes it works :)
2005-09-23T08:22:00.000Z	BlueEagle	tucoz	To set it as default add ao=oss to .mplayer/config
2005-09-23T08:22:00.000Z	tucoz	BlueEagle	great, thanks
2005-09-23T08:23:00.000Z	BlueEagle	tucoz	also you might want to set vo=xv there
2005-09-23T08:23:00.000Z	BlueEagle	tucoz	Yes. Not sure what the default is, but on my system it was not scaling to full-screen correctly.
2005-09-23T08:24:00.000Z	BlueEagle	tucoz	...and if you've got an ATi card and want to play mplayer video on the tv-out you need to use the gl2 video overlay (atleast that's what coolbeer told me)
2005-09-23T08:25:00.000Z	tucoz	BlueEagle	I have a ati card, but don't use it for tv-out atm. I'll remember that for later. Thanks alot btw.
2005-09-23T08:30:00.000Z	tucoz	BlueEagle	ah, thanks. Nice to get rid of that kaffeine-plugin. Thanks for the help
2005-09-23T08:33:00.000Z	BlueEagle	tucoz	no problem at all. :)
2005-09-23T08:54:00.000Z	tucoz	BlueEagle	/usr/lib/win32 for the win32 codecs
