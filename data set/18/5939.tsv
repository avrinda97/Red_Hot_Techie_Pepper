2008-07-31T07:40:00.000Z	ice109		does anyone know a light web browser that is as functional as firefox but doesn't memory leak?
2008-07-31T07:40:00.000Z	Gillpy_	ice109	opera
2008-07-31T07:40:00.000Z	Gillpy_	ice109	dillo is very light, but not as functional
2008-07-31T07:41:00.000Z	ice109	Gillpy_	off the top of of your head do you know what it's lacking?
2008-07-31T07:42:00.000Z	Gillpy_	ice109	i think main thing is flash
2008-07-31T07:43:00.000Z	Gillpy_	ice109	you can get graphics with links2
2008-07-31T07:43:00.000Z	ice109	Gillpy_	but no way it has flash right
2008-07-31T07:43:00.000Z	Gillpy_	ice109	no CLI browsers support flash
2008-07-31T08:34:00.000Z	Gillpy_	ice109	shows all processes
2008-07-31T08:27:00.000Z	Gillpy_	ice109	use which() to find executables
2008-07-31T08:27:00.000Z	Gillpy_	ice109	or whereis()
2008-07-31T08:28:00.000Z	ice109	Gillpy_	apparently terminal is not an app
2008-07-31T08:30:00.000Z	Gillpy_	ice109	Do you know what xterm you are using?
2008-07-31T08:30:00.000Z	ice109	Gillpy_	it's just called terminal
2008-07-31T08:33:00.000Z	Gillpy_	ice109	you could do ps -e | grep term to get the process name, then use whereis
2008-07-31T08:33:00.000Z	ice109	Gillpy_	what does -e flag do?
2008-07-31T08:37:00.000Z	Gillpy_	ice109	you need to use screen for that
2008-07-31T08:42:00.000Z	Gillpy_	ice109	screen is what you are looking for
