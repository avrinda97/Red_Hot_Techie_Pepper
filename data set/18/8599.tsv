2007-07-27T05:47:00.000Z	Ubunnted		Hello! : )
2007-07-27T05:48:00.000Z	Ubunnted		Does anyone know why on a fresh Unbuntu install the hard drive is working non-stop?
2007-07-27T05:49:00.000Z	Folko	Ubunnted	Maybe updatedb is running
2007-07-27T05:50:00.000Z	Ubunnted	Folko	I've never known 'updatedb' to run for over two hours.
2007-07-27T05:50:00.000Z	Folko	Ubunnted	Install and run atop, it displays which program is using the HDD
2007-07-27T05:51:00.000Z	Ubunnted	Folko	I've done that and I haven't yet been able to nail down what's doing it.
2007-07-27T05:53:00.000Z	Ubunnted	Folko	Top normally brings programs running the most CPU to the top, but I'll bet I'm not using it right.
2007-07-27T05:53:00.000Z	Folko	Ubunnted	not top, atop - It's a different program
2007-07-27T05:54:00.000Z	Ubunnted	Folko	Or I've neglected an option...
2007-07-27T05:54:00.000Z	Ubunnted	Folko	OH! Let me try.
2007-07-27T05:54:00.000Z	Ubunnted	Folko	Let me try...
2007-07-27T05:57:00.000Z	Ubunnted	Folko	'atop' seems to be very much like 'top'...
2007-07-27T05:57:00.000Z	Folko	Ubunnted	With the difference that it displays programs by drive usage. You need to run it as root (sudo) and then wait a few seconds
2007-07-27T06:03:00.000Z	Folko	Ubunnted	Any progress with atop?
2007-07-27T06:09:00.000Z	Folko	Ubunnted	Did you run it as root?
2007-07-27T06:10:00.000Z	Ubunnted	Folko	I *think* (I never know when I'm REALLY root in Ubuntu), via 'sudo bash'.
2007-07-27T06:10:00.000Z	Folko	Ubunnted	You're root when the last character of your prompt is #, users have $
2007-07-27T06:10:00.000Z	Ubunnted	Folko	That's what I thought. : )
