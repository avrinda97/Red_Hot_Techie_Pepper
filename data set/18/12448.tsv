2006-04-20T14:08:00.000Z	mwe	volley	I recommend using archive.ubuntu.com instead of ca.archive.ubuntu.com though. that will redirect you to a good mirror
2006-04-20T14:09:00.000Z	mwe	volley	what did you type?
2006-04-20T14:09:00.000Z	mwe	volley	sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade probably
2006-04-20T14:11:00.000Z	mwe	volley	or fluxbox
2006-04-20T14:13:00.000Z	mwe	volley	fluxbox is a cool light weight window manager
2006-04-20T14:14:00.000Z	volley	mwe	is fluxbox like a taly different shell?
2006-04-20T14:15:00.000Z	mwe	volley	shell?
2006-04-20T14:15:00.000Z	mwe	volley	it's a different window manager.
