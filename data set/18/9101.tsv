2007-08-11T08:17:00.000Z	dystopianray	cjae_	do you still have the deb in /var/cache/apt/archives/ ?
2007-08-11T08:18:00.000Z	cjae_	dystopianray	??
2007-08-11T08:19:00.000Z	dystopianray	cjae_	if you still have the deb you can install that
2007-08-11T08:19:00.000Z	cjae_	dystopianray	thanks
2007-08-11T08:21:00.000Z	cjae_	dystopianray	it says same one in repositories, how does it know if they are down?
2007-08-11T08:21:00.000Z	dystopianray	cjae_	i'm not sure what you are saying?
2007-08-11T08:22:00.000Z	cjae_	dystopianray	sorry it said there is the same version in the repositories and that I should install that one, how would it know if the repositories are down?
2007-08-11T08:24:00.000Z	cjae_	dystopianray	btw that was quite the handy piece of info thanks just going to ingnore it
2007-08-11T08:24:00.000Z	cjae_	dystopianray	that message that is not what you said
2007-08-11T08:25:00.000Z	dystopianray	cjae_	sorry, i have no idea what you're going on about :S
2007-08-11T08:27:00.000Z	cjae_	dystopianray	Thanks for your help. I see you are busy though, but you did ij fact help my situation.
2007-08-11T08:27:00.000Z	dystopianray	cjae_	so you were able to use the .deb to install wine?
2007-08-11T08:29:00.000Z	cjae_	dystopianray	yes but it told me that there was a same version in the repositories as in the cache and it recommended that I install the repo one. I was just curious to know how it knew about the online one if the repos are down
2007-08-11T08:30:00.000Z	dystopianray	cjae_	if you had previously used the repo it must remember it
2007-08-11T08:30:00.000Z	cjae_	dystopianray	I see thank you
