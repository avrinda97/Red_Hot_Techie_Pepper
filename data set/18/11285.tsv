2008-11-02T11:43:00.000Z	Gibbster		Hi Guys. I'm trying to get mail working on my new server, and while I can send mail out, I can't receive it. I was wondering if someone can hold my hand a bit
2008-11-02T11:44:00.000Z	Gibbster		If I try telnet localhost 25 locally, I get a response, but when I try telnet <ip> 25 externally, I can't connect
2008-11-02T11:44:00.000Z	eumario	Gibbster	Are you behind a Router?
2008-11-02T11:45:00.000Z	Gibbster	eumario	I'm using linode, which is a vps provider
2008-11-02T11:46:00.000Z	eumario	Gibbster	Okay, then you would basically need to make sure that Port 25 is being listened to on all addresses, and not just localhost.
2008-11-02T11:46:00.000Z	Gibbster	eumario	sounds good. Care to guide me through that? ;-)
2008-11-02T11:46:00.000Z	eumario	Gibbster	if you do a netstat -nat, and look for port 25, and it shows 127.0.0.1::25, then you need to have it bind to all addresses, which is done through 0.0.0.0::25
2008-11-02T11:47:00.000Z	eumario	Gibbster	Which mailer are you using?
2008-11-02T11:47:00.000Z	Gibbster		eumario:tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:25            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN
2008-11-02T11:47:00.000Z	Gibbster		eumario:sendmail
2008-11-02T11:48:00.000Z	eumario	Gibbster	Alright, that means that sendmail is only listening to loopback, EG: 127.0.0.1
2008-11-02T11:48:00.000Z	Gibbster		keith: have you installed flash?
2008-11-02T11:49:00.000Z	Gibbster	eumario	hmm. do you know how to change that?
2008-11-02T11:49:00.000Z	Gibbster	eumario	I'm a sendmail newbie, unfortunately
2008-11-02T11:49:00.000Z	eumario	Gibbster	Sec, gotta look it up.  Been a while since I messed with sendmail for SMTP/POP
2008-11-02T11:49:00.000Z	Gibbster		keith: so what happens when you browse to a youtube page?
2008-11-02T11:49:00.000Z	Gibbster		keith: nothing at all? and does other flash sites work?
2008-11-02T11:50:00.000Z	Gibbster	eumario	thanks for this!
