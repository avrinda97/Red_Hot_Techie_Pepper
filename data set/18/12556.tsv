2006-04-04T11:08:00.000Z	healot		samurai, use uim instead...
2006-04-04T11:08:00.000Z	healot		install anthy,uim-gapplet and uim, load the gapplet, bam
2006-04-04T11:09:00.000Z	samurai22	healot	what is the difference between uim and scim?
2006-04-04T11:12:00.000Z	healot	samurai22	for GNOME use, uim is more lightweight, and there is a a gapplet to activate uim for any GNOME application
2006-04-04T11:13:00.000Z	samurai22	healot	can you use both at the same time or are they m.exclusive?
2006-04-04T11:14:00.000Z	samurai22	healot	will try uim.  thanks for your help
2006-04-04T11:16:00.000Z	healot	samurai22	in synapctic list you should see "anthy", "uim" and "uim gapplet"
2006-04-04T11:18:00.000Z	samurai22	healot	do you mean uim-applet-gnome
2006-04-04T11:27:00.000Z	samurai22	healot	installed the packages, but where do I find them in the menu?
2006-04-04T11:28:00.000Z	healot	samurai22	add the gapplet by clicking right on GNOME panels
2006-04-04T11:32:00.000Z	samurai22	healot	got it, but gedit crashes now
2006-04-04T11:33:00.000Z	healot	samurai22	did you run the uim setup yet?
2006-04-04T11:33:00.000Z	healot	samurai22	"uim"+tab+tab :)
2006-04-04T11:35:00.000Z	healot	samurai22	if you actually find the setup for uim, find the "lazy loading" feature, check it and reload the gapplet
2006-04-04T11:38:00.000Z	samurai22	healot	palyed with the config but still crashes - should I try and remove all scim-related packages
2006-04-04T11:43:00.000Z	samurai22	healot	still crashes but only when I click on the gedit window now (instead of directly upon startup)
2006-04-04T11:51:00.000Z	samurai22	healot	I have the stack trace of the crash - seems to be coming from uim
2006-04-04T11:54:00.000Z	samurai22	healot	how to make sure it's all deleted?
