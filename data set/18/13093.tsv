2006-01-11T16:52:00.000Z	iKrnel		Hi guys. This is my first time using ubuntu, I must say, it is pretty fast! :D
2006-01-11T16:53:00.000Z	iKrnel		But I have a problem. I don't know what the default root password is. I don't have an ubuntu manual, and the wiki didn't help. Can anybody help me?
2006-01-11T16:53:00.000Z	jhenn	iKrnel	sudo -s
2006-01-11T16:54:00.000Z	iKrnel	jhenn	It wants me to type in the password for root.
2006-01-11T16:54:00.000Z	iKrnel	jhenn	...which I don't have...
2006-01-11T16:54:00.000Z	jhenn	iKrnel	type the user password
2006-01-11T16:54:00.000Z	iKrnel		whoa that's hax!
2006-01-11T16:54:00.000Z	jhenn	iKrnel	if its not your machine  your not going to be able to and I'm not going to help you break into it
2006-01-11T16:54:00.000Z	iKrnel	jhenn	Anyway to disable that option?
2006-01-11T16:54:00.000Z	jhenn	iKrnel	what option?
2006-01-11T16:55:00.000Z	iKrnel	jhenn	sudo -s. Lets you become root without the root password. I don't like it.
2006-01-11T16:55:00.000Z	jhenn	iKrnel	just make sure other users aren't in the sudoers file
2006-01-11T16:55:00.000Z	iKrnel	jhenn	Ah, good point.
2006-01-11T16:56:00.000Z	iKrnel	jhenn	This is most probably a dumb question, but how do I find out the root password from here?
2006-01-11T16:56:00.000Z	jhenn	iKrnel	there is no root password
2006-01-11T16:56:00.000Z	iKrnel	jhenn	Ah. Well, I'll have to set one...
2006-01-11T16:57:00.000Z	jhenn		!root
2006-01-11T16:57:00.000Z	jhenn	iKrnel	^^
