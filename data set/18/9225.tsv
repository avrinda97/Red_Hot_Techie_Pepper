2008-06-27T11:06:00.000Z	giacomo_carissim		is there a way to replace gnome-volume-manager with alsamixer?
2008-06-27T11:06:00.000Z	giacomo_carissim		can i do that with ubuntu or will it uninstall a lot more?
2008-06-27T11:07:00.000Z	giacomo_carissim		ok, ill give it a try
2008-06-27T11:07:00.000Z	giacomo_carissim		it says i have to uninstall ubuntu-desktop
2008-06-27T11:08:00.000Z	giacomo_carissim		can i install the alsamixergui and have that run instead of gnome-volume-manager?
2008-06-27T11:10:00.000Z	giacomo_carissim		is there a way to have my system volume buttons adjust the alsamixergui instead of gnome-volume-manager?
2008-06-27T11:11:00.000Z	giacomo_carissim		but it seems like there would be a way to link the buttons to alsamixer instead, no?
2008-06-27T11:12:00.000Z	giacomo_carissim		create a new button?  but the buttons are stuck on the front of my laptop
2008-06-27T11:13:00.000Z	WhoNeedszzz	giacomo_carissim	ohhh. that button. ok yes. you can remap the keyboard to launch alsamixergui.
2008-06-27T11:06:00.000Z	WhoNeedszzz	giacomo_carissim	sure. uninstall gnome-volume-manager and install alsamixergui :p
2008-06-27T11:07:00.000Z	WhoNeedszzz	giacomo_carissim	use synaptic
2008-06-27T11:08:00.000Z	WhoNeedszzz	giacomo_carissim	then don't. just install alsamixergui.
2008-06-27T11:09:00.000Z	WhoNeedszzz	giacomo_carissim	it is seperate. it is located under the Applications menu
2008-06-27T11:10:00.000Z	WhoNeedszzz	giacomo_carissim	no the button is for gnome-volume-manager
2008-06-27T11:12:00.000Z	WhoNeedszzz	giacomo_carissim	you can create a new button via a launcher if you'd like
2008-06-27T11:13:00.000Z	WhoNeedszzz	giacomo_carissim	should be
2008-06-27T11:14:00.000Z	WhoNeedszzz	giacomo_carissim	no. they need to be mapped to the appropriate raising or lowering volume command
2008-06-27T11:17:00.000Z	WhoNeedszzz	giacomo_carissim	hit add for the commands and type amixer set Master 0% and hit the mute button on the laptop. add a new one as amixer set Master 10%- and hit the lower volume button on the laptop. lastly add a new one as amixer set Master 10%+ and hit the raise volume button on the laptop
