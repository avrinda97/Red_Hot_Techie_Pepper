2006-11-22T08:17:00.000Z	DualCortex		Hey guys, I got a problem with Eclipse not loading. It shouldn't be something hard to answer, anyway here's a link to my thread with all the info: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=304443
2006-11-22T08:19:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	DualCortex	'eclipse' is probably a script that sets $JAVA_HOME to the wrong spot
2006-11-22T08:19:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	DualCortex	if you look at 'which eclipse' see if it's a script and set JAVA_HOME to where you installed 1.5
2006-11-22T08:20:00.000Z	DualCortex	Kingsqueak	what's "which eclipse"   :P
2006-11-22T08:20:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	DualCortex	you tell me, it will tell you where 'eclipse' is
2006-11-22T08:20:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	DualCortex	according to your PATH
2006-11-22T08:21:00.000Z	DualCortex	Kingsqueak	oh ok, didn't know it was a command. Here's the output:  /usr/lib/eclipse/eclipse
2006-11-22T08:21:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	DualCortex	now do 'file /usr/lib/eclipse/eclipse'
2006-11-22T08:22:00.000Z	DualCortex	Kingsqueak	output pastebin'ed
2006-11-22T08:23:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	DualCortex	link?
2006-11-22T08:23:00.000Z	DualCortex	Kingsqueak	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/33190/
2006-11-22T08:24:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	DualCortex	k, odd that's a binary file, I'm not sure why invoking it with full path works and without doesn't
2006-11-22T08:26:00.000Z	DualCortex	Kingsqueak	brb, going to relogin using xchat (currently on chatzilla)
2006-11-22T08:28:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	DualCortex	yeah not sure what your issue is, it's weird, I would just say to invoke it with the full path since it works
2006-11-22T08:29:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	DualCortex	why not just run it with the full path?
2006-11-22T08:30:00.000Z	DualCortex	Kingsqueak	yeah I will... sometimes just bothers me to have such simple bugs
2006-11-22T08:30:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	DualCortex	it's not you though I think it's the bin for Eclipse is doing something odd with paths
2006-11-22T08:30:00.000Z	Kingsqueak	DualCortex	you could run 'strace eclipse' and 'strace /path/to/eclipse' and see if there is anything interesting there
