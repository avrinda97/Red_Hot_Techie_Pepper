2005-10-22T09:26:00.000Z	wendy		well, I just installed 5.10, and now I need the root pw to mount a floppy, but I wassn't given a chance to create one during the install... how do I fix this?  thanks
2005-10-22T09:26:00.000Z	SEJeff	wendy	sudo command
2005-10-22T09:27:00.000Z	wendy	SEJeff	 thanks
2005-10-22T09:28:00.000Z	SEJeff	wendy	install firestarter
2005-10-22T09:28:00.000Z	wendy	SEJeff	 thanks
2005-10-22T09:29:00.000Z	SEJeff	wendy	yw
2005-10-22T09:30:00.000Z	SEJeff	wendy	If you must have a root terminal, sudo -s will do it for you
2005-10-22T09:34:00.000Z	wendy	SEJeff	 how would I get firestarter to load/start automatically at boot... thanks
2005-10-22T09:35:00.000Z	SEJeff	wendy	You will have to disable the sudo password for firestarter to auto-load
2005-10-22T09:35:00.000Z	SEJeff	wendy	Is that ok?
2005-10-22T09:36:00.000Z	wendy	SEJeff	 that doesn't seem to good... is the firewall running in stealth mode by default?
2005-10-22T09:37:00.000Z	SEJeff	wendy	you can disable the password JUST for firestarter if you want
2005-10-22T09:37:00.000Z	SEJeff	wendy	there are 0 open ports on ubuntu by default
2005-10-22T09:38:00.000Z	wendy	SEJeff	 does 0 ports equal good firewall setup?
2005-10-22T09:39:00.000Z	SEJeff	wendy	0 ports = no reason for a firewall actually
2005-10-22T09:40:00.000Z	SEJeff	wendy	Microsoft windows has many open ports by default
2005-10-22T09:40:00.000Z	wendy	SEJeff	 thanks for your help... gotta go.... sorry to run
2005-10-22T09:40:00.000Z	SEJeff	wendy	later
