2012-10-20T05:14:00.000Z	rozmuq		i need help,. my system occasionally freezes and logs out itself.. where or how do i check for errors?  (ubuntu kernel 3.2.6)
2012-10-20T05:14:00.000Z	rozmuq		u mean the kernel?
2012-10-20T05:16:00.000Z	Tohuw	rozmuq	start by checking the tail of /var/log/syslog
2012-10-20T05:17:00.000Z	rozmuq	Tohuw	right away.
2012-10-20T05:19:00.000Z	rozmuq	Tohuw	Oct 20 03:08:00 bt kernel: [ 4260.308748] [drm] Resetting GPU - can that refer to a video card problem? i'm not sure it's installed.
2012-10-20T05:22:00.000Z	Tohuw	rozmuq	that line indicates the GPU was reset at the driver level. It is often a normal event. Can you provide a pastebin of sudo tail -n 50 /var/log/syslog?
2012-10-20T05:24:00.000Z	rozmuq	Tohuw	sry again.. ://
2012-10-20T05:25:00.000Z	Tohuw	rozmuq	sudo tail -n 50 /var/log/syslog
2012-10-20T05:25:00.000Z	rozmuq	Tohuw	btw - i noticed it mainly happens to me when i press with the mouse on some window in the panel

2012-10-20T05:29:00.000Z	rozmuq	Tohuw	anything?
2012-10-20T05:30:00.000Z	Tohuw	rozmuq	There is a decent chance your problems are expressed in lines 35-39. What distribution version are you running? cat /etc/lsb-release can tell you if you aren't sure.

2012-10-20T05:33:00.000Z	Tohuw	rozmuq	You should consider upgrading to at least 12.04.1. 10.04 is end of life, and video issues grow more difficult to troubleshoot as the version grows more "stale"
2012-10-20T05:34:00.000Z	rozmuq	Tohuw	i'm using the bt r3 and i noticed people advised not to upgrade.
2012-10-20T05:41:00.000Z	Tohuw	rozmuq	Then backtrack needs to support your issues. You are too far from mainstream to consistently support
