2005-12-12T12:47:00.000Z	M_Wettendorff		anyone know how to add a danish keyboard??
2005-12-12T12:47:00.000Z	frogzoo	M_Wettendorff	system -> prefs -> keyboard
2005-12-12T12:50:00.000Z	frogzoo	M_Wettendorff	now add to your panel a new applet - keyboard chooser - & you can switch between - works for me for french
2005-12-12T12:51:00.000Z	frogzoo	M_Wettendorff	you need to go into layouts to add the danish kb
2005-12-12T12:52:00.000Z	frogzoo	M_Wettendorff	system -> prefs -> kb -> layout
2005-12-12T12:53:00.000Z	frogzoo	M_Wettendorff	this is very straightforward - system -> prefs -> kb -> layout -> add "danish"
2005-12-12T12:56:00.000Z	frogzoo	M_Wettendorff	then right click task bar - add to panel -> add application -> preferences -> keyboard
2005-12-12T13:17:00.000Z	frogzoo	M_Wettendorff	you manage to get a kb selector onto your task bar?
2005-12-12T13:18:00.000Z	frogzoo	M_Wettendorff	just left click - & you can change installed kbs
2005-12-12T13:19:00.000Z	frogzoo	M_Wettendorff	system -> prefs -> kb -> layout - now add danish
2005-12-12T13:22:00.000Z	frogzoo	M_Wettendorff	do you now have a 'US' on your taskbar?
2005-12-12T13:25:00.000Z	frogzoo	M_Wettendorff	right click task bar -> add to panel -> #### (something) -> kb  {my batteries are flat, so this is from memory}
2005-12-12T13:29:00.000Z	frogzoo	M_Wettendorff	keyboard indicator's what you want
2005-12-12T13:31:00.000Z	frogzoo	M_Wettendorff	but if you click the "US" can you see a danish option?
2005-12-12T13:42:00.000Z	M_Wettendorff	frogzoo	have now delete the danish keyboard..  that chance the indicator to say "USA" then i added the danish layout again (Looks as the right one) but i cant use it..
2005-12-12T13:42:00.000Z	frogzoo	M_Wettendorff	damn - did you check the box in layout to enable the danish?
2005-12-12T13:44:00.000Z	frogzoo	M_Wettendorff	woot! - whew
2005-12-12T13:46:00.000Z	frogzoo	M_Wettendorff	yw
