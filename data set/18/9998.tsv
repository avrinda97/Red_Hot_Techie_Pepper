2007-03-11T11:24:00.000Z	eoX		can someone plz explain to me what is a chroot environment?
2007-03-11T11:24:00.000Z	eoX		or just a guide to chroot
2007-03-11T11:25:00.000Z	arrenlex	eoX	A chroot is another Linux installation sitting in a folder of another one.
2007-03-11T11:28:00.000Z	eoX	arrenlex	so basically there is no advantage of me installing realplayer in chroot rite? and flash and firefox32 all that
2007-03-11T11:28:00.000Z	eoX	arrenlex	is it better just to downgrade to 32bit ubuntu and have those things natively supported?
2007-03-11T11:31:00.000Z	arrenlex	eoX	I strongly advise you to run a 32-bit distro. You won't notice any performance difference from a 64-bit operating system under normal desktop use, you'll only run into compatibility troubles.
2007-03-11T11:35:00.000Z	eoX	arrenlex	i think u are largely rite i think 64bit only helps speed up encoding and extracting of files or Am i wrong? i tried running firefox and flash on 32bit library its pretty good but realplayer refuse to run so im thinking of chroot but just reading into it so don't know too much
2007-03-11T11:37:00.000Z	eoX	arrenlex	why does that bother you soo much? i picked up this habit in college like b/c y and u haha
2007-03-11T11:38:00.000Z	arrenlex	eoX	64-bit doesn't actually speed up applications; it simply allows you to access more physical memory (4GB was the limit for 32-bit) and resolves several CPU and memory bottlenecks which could not be addressed by 32, which you won't feel anyway under desktop use.
2007-03-11T11:38:00.000Z	arrenlex	eoX	I take the time to type things out properly; why can't you? It makes you sound like a moron and makes it hard for me to take you seriously.
2007-03-11T11:39:00.000Z	eoX	arrenlex	i only have 2 gig of ram so i guess 64bit is not needed at all
2007-03-11T11:40:00.000Z	eoX	arrenlex	i don't think shorthands makes me look retarded but if you don't like it i can type out the whole thing
2007-03-11T11:40:00.000Z	arrenlex	eoX	Thank you very much. :)
2007-03-11T11:41:00.000Z	eoX	arrenlex	well since Im gonna reinstall with 32 bit is there any shortcomings from using reiserfs and mount noatime? i don't see any personally
2007-03-11T11:42:00.000Z	eoX	arrenlex	 right now i'm using ext3 and mount defualt
2007-03-11T11:42:00.000Z	arrenlex	eoX	I've never run reiserFS, but I've heard if has some stability problems... you should read the wikipedia entry to see if they mention any drawbacks, or ask around.
2007-03-11T11:43:00.000Z	eoX	arrenlex	 K thank you
