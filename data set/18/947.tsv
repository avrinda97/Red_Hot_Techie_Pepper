2012-01-24T00:07:00.000Z	Titanoboa	ssta	I'll try to find it, thanks for the help :P
2012-01-24T00:08:00.000Z	Titanoboa		it's supposed to be for linux though. http://thepiratebay.org/torrent/5391426/VMware-server-1.0.8-126538_%28old_free-version_server_for_linux%29

2012-01-24T00:09:00.000Z	ssta	Titanoboa	umm...not a good idea to say that you pirated it here...
2012-01-24T00:09:00.000Z	ssta	Titanoboa	why not use virtualbox?
2012-01-24T00:09:00.000Z	ssta	Titanoboa	sudo apt-get install virtualbox-ose
2012-01-24T00:09:00.000Z	Titanoboa		(i reached that "torrent" by googling and it doesn't look illegal does it? it's just a free version)
2012-01-24T00:09:00.000Z	Titanoboa	ssta	okay if that's good i'll do that!
