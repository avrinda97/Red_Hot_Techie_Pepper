2005-12-12T13:04:00.000Z	Jowi	ubun-newbie	1. start synaptic, look for the kernel image you want and install it. It will automatically be added to your grub start menu or 2. download the sources for the kernel and configure and compile your own.
2005-12-12T13:05:00.000Z	Jowi	ubun-newbie	no, since "kernel" is not a package.
2005-12-12T13:10:00.000Z	Jowi	ubun-newbie	nope, but andril has :)
2005-12-13T12:06:00.000Z	Jowi	ubun-newbie	sudo apt-get install libmikmod2

2005-12-13T14:59:00.000Z	Jowi	ubun-newbie	did you install mp3 support yet?
2005-12-13T15:01:00.000Z	Jowi	ubun-newbie	as we were discussing, oh about 2 hours ago, most radio stations stream mp3. you need that
2005-12-13T15:02:00.000Z	Jowi	ubun-newbie	for xmms you need xmms-mad
2005-12-13T15:02:00.000Z	Jowi	ubun-newbie	for gsteamer you need gstreamer0.8-mad
2005-12-13T15:03:00.000Z	Jowi	ubun-newbie	well, streamtuner uses xmms for playing radio so you need that
2005-12-13T15:04:00.000Z	Jowi	ubun-newbie	if you want to use streamtuner you need xmms as well
2005-12-13T15:04:00.000Z	Jowi	ubun-newbie	sudo apt-get install xmms xmms-mad gstreamer0.8-mad
