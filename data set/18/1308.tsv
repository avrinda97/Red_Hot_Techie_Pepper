2011-03-29T05:12:00.000Z	aaron_c		hi, i'm on ubuntu 10.04 and  making regular backups with ubuntu's simple backup restore utility.  if i buy a new desktop and insatll ubuntu 10.10 is it possible to use my backup files make an exact image of my current desktop?
2011-03-29T05:13:00.000Z	DrFalcon	aaron_c	I would reccomend a clean install rather than an image, because hardware is going to be different.
2011-03-29T05:15:00.000Z	aaron_c	DrFalcon	i see, ok.  but if my current desktop completely, and i just get a new hard drive, i shoudl be able to make an exact copy with my backup files right?

2011-03-29T05:16:00.000Z	aaron_c	DrFalcon	gotcha.  and buy disk image, that's what ubuntu's built-in "Simple Backup Restore" utility does, right?

2011-03-29T05:17:00.000Z	DrFalcon	aaron_c	I've never used that utility, so I don't know.
2011-03-29T05:17:00.000Z	aaron_c	DrFalcon	ok.  thanks for your help!
2011-03-29T05:17:00.000Z	aaron_c		o oki'll look into dd
2011-03-29T05:18:00.000Z	DrFalcon	aaron_c	As someone else said, use DD to make a disk image, otherwise just copy files. I suggest rsync for file-level backups, because it won't do the whole thing over on backups subsequent to the first one.
2011-03-29T05:18:00.000Z	aaron_c		is there a way to make a list of pakcages i have insatlled on my 10.04 desktop, so i can reinstall all the same ones on 10.10 on my new desktop?
2011-03-29T05:19:00.000Z	DrFalcon	aaron_c	"dpkg --list" lists all installed packages.
2011-03-29T05:20:00.000Z	aaron_c	DrFalcon	ah ok.  is there a way to import a text file int apt-get install?
2011-03-29T05:21:00.000Z	aaron_c		so that i can take the log of dpkg --list and install verything with one command?
2011-03-29T05:21:00.000Z	DrFalcon	aaron_c	this thread explains the process: http://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/debian-26/%5Baptitude%5D-how-to-get-a-list-of-all-installed-packages-458119/
2011-03-29T05:22:00.000Z	DrFalcon	aaron_c	There is no one-step process, but it's not that involved.
2011-03-29T05:22:00.000Z	aaron_c	DrFalcon	cool, thanks!
