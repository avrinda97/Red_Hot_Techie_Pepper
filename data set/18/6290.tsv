2008-05-28T14:21:00.000Z	LordyFlashy		where can I configure my joystick?
2008-05-28T14:22:00.000Z	LordyFlashy		I don't know
2008-05-28T14:22:00.000Z	LordyFlashy		it's usb, I used it in a game once and didn't need to do anything but it won't work with snes9x
2008-05-28T14:23:00.000Z	LordyFlashy		thanks :)
2008-05-28T14:23:00.000Z	cerebrate	LordyFlashy	snes9x also does not work with my usb joypad.  I would suggest using zsnes, and it works with my joypad
2008-05-28T14:25:00.000Z	cerebrate	LordyFlashy	are you using ubuntu 64 bit?
2008-05-28T14:25:00.000Z	cerebrate	LordyFlashy	I got zsnes working under 64 bit on my lappy.
2008-05-28T14:26:00.000Z	cerebrate	LordyFlashy	first, you must go download the deb of zsnes from the ubuntu packages
2008-05-28T14:28:00.000Z	cerebrate	LordyFlashy	I realize this, and will tell you the exact command line stuff to run
2008-05-28T14:28:00.000Z	cerebrate	LordyFlashy	http://packages.ubuntu.com/hardy/i386/zsnes/download
2008-05-28T14:36:00.000Z	cerebrate	LordyFlashy	tell me when that is done
2008-05-28T14:38:00.000Z	cerebrate	LordyFlashy	copy-pasta
2008-05-28T14:49:00.000Z	cerebrate	LordyFlashy	 sudo dpkg -i --force-architecture zsnes_1.510-2ubuntu1_i386.deb
2008-05-28T14:51:00.000Z	cerebrate	LordyFlashy	just type out 'zsnes' into the console, hit enter, and tell me what it does
2008-05-28T14:53:00.000Z	cerebrate	LordyFlashy	that's what I expected.  type this into the console: zsnes -ad sdl
2008-05-28T14:57:00.000Z	cerebrate	LordyFlashy	make sure you configure your up/down left/right too
2008-05-28T14:59:00.000Z	cerebrate	LordyFlashy	those dependencies are actually 32 bit libraries.  They're for running any 32 bit program in 64 bit ubuntu.  I originally found them while attempting to install skype.
2008-05-28T15:02:00.000Z	cerebrate	LordyFlashy	dpkg usually resolves dependencies automagically like synaptic.  The ia32-libs just allows you to use --force-architecture
