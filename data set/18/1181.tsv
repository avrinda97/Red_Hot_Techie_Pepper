2011-05-06T16:15:00.000Z	FrankJameso	Da|Mummy	you need to know the name of the usb drive itself ( usually something like /dev/???   (3 letters), type in dmesg to see if you can find it's name. Then, you probably just have to make a directory, and type in sudo mount /dev/??? (need to find 3 letters) /address/to/mountpoint
2011-05-06T16:15:00.000Z	Da|Mummy	FrankJameso	its not usb, its sata
2011-05-06T16:15:00.000Z	FrankJameso		Draco I see, then I'm not sure how to help you
2011-05-06T16:15:00.000Z	Da|Mummy		internal that is
2011-05-06T16:15:00.000Z	FrankJameso	Da|Mummy	same process either way
2011-05-06T16:15:00.000Z	Da|Mummy		and its /dev/sdc
2011-05-06T16:16:00.000Z	Da|Mummy		and i tried sudo mount /dev/sdc /media/500GB
2011-05-06T16:16:00.000Z	FrankJameso	Da|Mummy	I guess you could use dmesg | grep /dev
