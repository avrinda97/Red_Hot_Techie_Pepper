2012-05-30T11:23:00.000Z	EliahKagan	cougar_	Since the live system on the external is probably not configured to be booted through the boot loader that was installed on the external in the installation process, the only ways I know of to make the external drive boot into the live system would involve booting from some other disk to change things on the external drive. That's not going to work for you, because you don't have any other disk. I think there might be a w
2012-05-30T11:24:00.000Z	EliahKagan	cougar_	Ubuntu's graphical installer, Ubiquity, can be installed on a non-live system, such as the system you can currently boot to on the external drive. You could install the package ubiquity in this system, and use it to install Ubuntu to the hard drive. This may or may not be painless, because I am not sure you have a package source handy. But you can create one if you don't.
2012-05-30T11:25:00.000Z	EliahKagan	cougar_	Before you try anything like that, though, there is something else that you should check. Are you absolutely sure that the OS *is* actually installed on the external drive? Is it possible that the OS is installed on the internal drive like you wanted, but that the GRUB2 boot loader is installed on the external drive? This would cause the operating system on the internal drive to require the external drive to be attached,
2012-05-30T11:28:00.000Z	EliahKagan	cougar_	Does the external drive's access light activate (flicker) when you access these files?
2012-05-30T11:31:00.000Z	EliahKagan	cougar_	the two most popular options are "sudo fdisk -l" and "sudo parted -l"
2012-05-30T11:32:00.000Z	EliahKagan	cougar_	you can list mounted partitions and their mount options with "mount" and you can list most mounted partitions and the amount of used, free, and total space with "df -h"
2012-05-30T11:34:00.000Z	EliahKagan	cougar_	if you want to try the Ubiquity idea, the actual package you'd install is ubiquity-frontend-gtk ...but i'm searching for information on this and there isn't a lot of it, Ubiquity does not seem designed to work in this way, so it might be best for you to just obtain a a few burnable CD's (a few in case you get a bad burn or something)
2012-05-30T11:35:00.000Z	EliahKagan	cougar_	that looks like output from "df -h" but if there is no mounted partition on the internal drive, then you won't see it; you might want to run "sudo fdisk -l" or "sudo parted -l" instead
2012-05-30T11:37:00.000Z	EliahKagan	cougar_	Did you have important data on the external drive that you wanted to retain?
2012-05-30T11:39:00.000Z	EliahKagan	cougar_	No, I just wanted to make sure you didn't *already* lose it.
2012-05-30T11:39:00.000Z	EliahKagan	cougar_	I wanted to make sure you have successfully accessed it from within your currently installed Ubuntu system.
2012-05-30T11:41:00.000Z	EliahKagan	cougar_	Yes, you can move it...if you can run off an operating system other than it. You could attempt to move it from itself, but this would likely not work, and you might have subtle errors in the target system as a result.
2012-05-30T11:42:00.000Z	EliahKagan	cougar_	The best thing to do might be to buy a cheap (it could be relatively small, like 1 GB) USB flash drive
2012-05-30T11:45:00.000Z	EliahKagan	cougar_	I wonder if you can run debian-installer (the text-based installer that is on the Ubuntu alternate CD) from inside an installed system.
2012-05-30T11:45:00.000Z	EliahKagan	cougar_	That would be something to look into.
2012-05-30T11:48:00.000Z	EliahKagan	cougar_	unfortunately i have to sign off now, but you may want to research this...or, you could see if other people enter the channel who know (you shouldn't reask a lot, but as hours pass and there are more users here)...or you could ask (search first) someplace like the Ubuntu Forums or AskUbuntu or Launchpad Answers
2012-05-30T11:49:00.000Z	EliahKagan	cougar_	or i'll be back in here at some point and would probably be willing to continue looking into it...but it sounds like you want your computer working without the external attached sooner rather than later ....so, good luck! (and remember that suggestion about the USB flash drive ;-) )
