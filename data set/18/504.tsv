2012-01-24T11:49:00.000Z	blucalculatr		i tried to, it said "Package virtualbox is not available, but is referred to by another package. This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or is only available from another source"
2012-01-24T11:49:00.000Z	blucalculatr		doing sudo apt-get update and sudo apt-get upgrade, see if that fixes it
2012-01-24T11:51:00.000Z	blucalculatr		okay its not working.
2012-01-24T11:51:00.000Z	blucalculatr		Package virtualbox is not available, but is referred to by another package.
2012-01-24T11:51:00.000Z	blucalculatr		This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or
2012-01-24T11:51:00.000Z	blucalculatr		is only available from another source
2012-01-24T11:52:00.000Z	blucalculatr		on the desktop, 11.04, on the laptop, im trying to install 10.04
2012-01-24T11:53:00.000Z	blucalculatr		okay, thanks tristan3199
2012-01-24T11:55:00.000Z	zykotick9	blucalculatr	fyi in 10.04 VB would be virtualbox-ose
2012-01-24T11:56:00.000Z	blucalculatr	zykotick9	okay, thanks, that works.
2012-01-24T12:21:00.000Z	zykotick9	blucalculatr	it won't work with the OSE version the new VBox doesn't have this issue, only the OSE
2012-01-24T12:22:00.000Z	blucalculatr	zykotick9	uh. so where do i get the new VBox? (im on 11.04 if that makes a difference)
2012-01-24T12:23:00.000Z	zykotick9	blucalculatr	11.04 doesn't have "virtualbox"?  get it from Oracle (if you must, sorry i'm not a fan of Oracle/VBox)
2012-01-24T12:25:00.000Z	zykotick9	blucalculatr	are you being helped by tristan3199 - or is this two issues?
2012-01-24T12:26:00.000Z	zykotick9	blucalculatr	apt-get remove the version you installed, then download the Oracle version (or add there repo and install virtualbox)
2012-01-24T12:31:00.000Z	zykotick9	blucalculatr	if you install that, it would be difficult to remove <warning>
