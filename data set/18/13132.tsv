2006-01-14T06:00:00.000Z	Mapionetka		i have a folder called test. test has 775, is owned by root and gentest, josh is a part of gentest but cant do anything to the dir test. any ideas?
2006-01-14T06:02:00.000Z	mwe	Mapionetka	does "groups" confirm that josh is member of gentest?
2006-01-14T06:02:00.000Z	Mapionetka	mwe	yes
2006-01-14T06:03:00.000Z	mwe	Mapionetka	an josh can't touch foobar in there to create that file?
2006-01-14T06:05:00.000Z	mwe	Mapionetka	what does ls -l test.txt say?
2006-01-14T06:06:00.000Z	Mapionetka	mwe	the test file was never created, do you want me to sudo and do it?
2006-01-14T06:07:00.000Z	mwe	Mapionetka	no
2006-01-14T06:07:00.000Z	mwe	Mapionetka	what happens if you touch foobar as josh in that dir?
2006-01-14T06:10:00.000Z	mwe	Mapionetka	groups confirms josh is in gentest and ls -ld test confirms root:gentest and 775?
2006-01-14T06:10:00.000Z	mwe	Mapionetka	if so and josh cant write in there it's badly broken
2006-01-14T06:10:00.000Z	Mapionetka	mwe	that is the case
2006-01-14T06:13:00.000Z	Mapionetka	mwe	im logged in as josh atm, so if i use groups josh i get josh and gentest, but if i just use groups i get the long list of all the various half admin groups aswell
2006-01-14T06:13:00.000Z	mwe	Mapionetka	just groups includes the gentest group?
2006-01-14T06:13:00.000Z	mwe	Mapionetka	and what about "id"
2006-01-14T06:15:00.000Z	mwe	Mapionetka	log out and back in and it will be fixed
2006-01-14T06:15:00.000Z	mwe	Mapionetka	you need to do that for group changes to take effect
2006-01-14T06:16:00.000Z	mwe	Mapionetka	did you get that?
2006-01-14T06:16:00.000Z	mwe	Mapionetka	log out and back in
