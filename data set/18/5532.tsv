2008-10-05T08:48:00.000Z	Agent_bob		headcheese not in gdm.   gdm is the login manager.
2008-10-05T08:49:00.000Z	headcheese	Agent_bob	Awesome, thanks for the clarification.  How can I make a partition for extra data, if I have unused space?
2008-10-05T08:49:00.000Z	Agent_bob		headcheese gparted
2008-10-05T08:50:00.000Z	headcheese	Agent_bob	 thanks.
2008-10-05T08:50:00.000Z	Agent_bob		welcome.
2008-10-05T08:51:00.000Z	Agent_bob		headcheese cli tools like   cfdisk   and  mkfs.<type>   are installed by default too.
2008-10-05T08:52:00.000Z	headcheese	Agent_bob	 I am not familure with those, is gparted gui based?
2008-10-05T08:52:00.000Z	Agent_bob		headcheese yes
2008-10-05T08:52:00.000Z	headcheese	Agent_bob	 You rock!
2008-10-05T08:52:00.000Z	Agent_bob		headcheese i know.
2008-10-05T08:52:00.000Z	Agent_bob		pfft   heheh.   anyway.   youre welcome.
2008-10-05T08:53:00.000Z	headcheese	Agent_bob	 didnt let me finish.... you rock!  less the modesty :P
2008-10-05T08:54:00.000Z	Agent_bob	tictac232434	not on that issue.  file systems and devices    sub system cli is my strong suit and it's kinda weak.
2008-10-05T08:54:00.000Z	Agent_bob	tictac232434	welcome.
2008-10-05T08:55:00.000Z	Agent_bob	tictac232434	for the record, now you see the irony in "me rocking"  :)
2008-10-05T08:55:00.000Z	headcheese	Agent_bob	 In gparted it only shows my software raid and nothing else.  Even the option to make a new partition is greyed out.  Any suggestions?
2008-10-05T08:55:00.000Z	headcheese	Agent_bob	 Never mind, figured it out.
