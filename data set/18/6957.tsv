2008-04-25T01:51:00.000Z	El1		Hi guys I can't manage to get my nvidia drivers working in hardy heron, everything installs just fine without errors but when I reboot I get a prompt to run in low graphics mode saying there's no drivers installed
2008-04-25T01:52:00.000Z	El1		I did that millions of times reinstalling
2008-04-25T01:52:00.000Z	El1		I even used the nvidia.com driver
2008-04-25T01:53:00.000Z	El1		and tried installing the packages from synaptic
2008-04-25T01:53:00.000Z	El1		yet still when I try to restart after a perfect install of drivers it says low gfx mode
2008-04-25T01:53:00.000Z	El1		what could be the cause of this?
2008-04-25T01:54:00.000Z	El1		Could it be a problem that I'm still running hardy beta?
2008-04-25T01:54:00.000Z	rbs-tito	El1	It is a bit confusing when you type over multiple lines, please keep your messages to one send. Could you put your xorg.conf on pastebin.org please ?
2008-04-25T01:57:00.000Z	El1	rbs-tito	the xorg.conf file is at http://pastebin.org/31806
2008-04-25T01:58:00.000Z	rbs-tito	El1	You said you tried the Nvidia binary from nvidia.com ?
2008-04-25T02:01:00.000Z	El1	rbs-tito	are you finding anything in my xorg.conf?
2008-04-25T02:03:00.000Z	rbs-tito	El1	It seems that you are using the open source nv drivers on a board called "vesa". Try letting the nvidia driver reconfigure it
2008-04-25T02:05:00.000Z	El1	rbs-tito	by reconfiguring it, do you mean installing the nvidia drivers? Because that's what I did lots of times but it just ends up back in low-res mode back to vesa.
2008-04-25T02:06:00.000Z	rbs-tito	El1	Have you tried sudo dpkg reconfigure xserver-xorg
2008-04-25T02:06:00.000Z	rbs-tito	El1	Use "nvidia" as the driver name
2008-04-25T02:06:00.000Z	El1	rbs-tito	will try dpkg now, but when I select nvidia as the driver name it doesn't work.
2008-04-25T02:06:00.000Z	rbs-tito	El1	I can't suggest anything else, sorry.
2008-04-25T02:07:00.000Z	El1	rbs-tito	thanks anyway for the help
