2006-06-21T06:45:00.000Z	lufis		Hi... I read somewhere that it's possible to mix and match different things in the desktop environment. Like using a replacement for nautilus, for instance. Can someone direct me to some alternative apps for this?
2006-06-21T06:46:00.000Z	jrib	lufis	thunar might be one
2006-06-21T06:46:00.000Z	lufis	jrib	Thanks!
2006-06-21T06:48:00.000Z	jrib	lufis	ctrl-z sends SIGSTOP
2006-06-21T06:48:00.000Z	lufis	jrib	What?
2006-06-21T06:49:00.000Z	jrib	lufis	maybe it will make more sense if you run a program, press ctrl-z and try to use the program
2006-06-21T06:50:00.000Z	jrib	lufis	it's like a pause button
2006-09-13T06:48:00.000Z	jrib	lufis	sed maybe?  I doubt it's worth it though
2006-09-13T06:48:00.000Z	lufis	jrib	well, anything to speed things up a bit :P
2006-12-15T17:22:00.000Z	jrib	lufis	look it up on google?
2006-12-15T17:23:00.000Z	lufis	jrib	well, the drive is hard to get to and doesn't have any of its brandings visible
2006-12-15T17:24:00.000Z	jrib	lufis	use 'sudo lshw' to get a model number of some kind for it, then use google
2006-12-15T17:24:00.000Z	lufis	jrib	oh, cool, thanks!
2007-01-07T11:24:00.000Z	jrib	lufis	why not just use metacity that's default in GNOME?
2007-01-07T11:24:00.000Z	lufis	jrib	Well, metacity works fine, i just want to try something different as a learning experience
2007-01-07T11:26:00.000Z	jrib	lufis	ah, in that case:  fluxbox (or any of the other boxes), fvwm, icewm, ratpoison, ... there's one more I liked but i forget the name :( ...  are fun to try
2007-05-05T05:15:00.000Z	jrib	lufis	java virtual machine and because it is java
2007-09-19T16:30:00.000Z	lufis	jrib	thanks
