2007-10-13T14:29:00.000Z	papo		heck is it me or is launchpad sloooow atm?
2007-10-13T14:30:00.000Z	FallenHitokiri	papo	it's not you
2007-10-13T14:30:00.000Z	papo	FallenHitokiri	Ah ok
2007-10-13T14:32:00.000Z	papo	FallenHitokiri	Is this just some temporary problem or is it because some high load due to the gutsy release?
2007-10-13T14:33:00.000Z	FallenHitokiri	papo	sorry but I am no official, I don't know what load is on the server
2007-10-13T14:33:00.000Z	papo	FallenHitokiri	no problem... I'm just waiting a bit
2007-10-13T14:33:00.000Z	FallenHitokiri	papo	but maybe currently is a high load or your internet is just slow ;) (stop loading porn *scnr*)
2007-10-13T14:34:00.000Z	papo	FallenHitokiri	well I can rule out the last two :)
2007-10-13T14:43:00.000Z	papo	FallenHitokiri	Ehrm... If I want to attach 3 files, do I have to make 3 comments? This sounds odd
2007-10-13T14:43:00.000Z	FallenHitokiri	papo	sorry? what are we talking about?
2007-10-13T14:44:00.000Z	papo	FallenHitokiri	Still launchpad, sorry
2007-10-13T14:44:00.000Z	FallenHitokiri	papo	i have no idea sorry.
2007-10-13T14:47:00.000Z	FallenHitokiri	papo	https://launchpad.net/+tour https://launchpad.net/faq
2007-10-13T14:51:00.000Z	papo	FallenHitokiri	thanks. Let's see whether that helps
2007-10-13T15:02:00.000Z	FallenHitokiri	papo	a shared partition fat? sorry but this is ... fat sucks. a journaled system is standard. and windows suports ext3 and linux supports ntfs
2007-10-13T15:03:00.000Z	papo	FallenHitokiri	Windows supports ext3? That's quite new to me. There is software for windows but Cheek said he doesen't want to install it
2007-10-13T15:04:00.000Z	papo	FallenHitokiri	And I didn't say linux didn't support ntfs. I was talking about grub
2007-10-13T15:04:00.000Z	FallenHitokiri	papo	yeah - there are fs-drivers. after the first crash when fat is f*k up he know why to not use old unstable filesystem
