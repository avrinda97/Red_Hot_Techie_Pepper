2010-09-30T17:10:00.000Z	wild_oscar		is "used" different in "df -h" and gparted?
2010-09-30T17:10:00.000Z	wild_oscar		for a specific /dev, that is
2010-09-30T17:11:00.000Z	wild_oscar	adeola0405	don't forget you might have more than one partition (/dev/sda1, sda2...) and you might be comparing one partition (sda1) 's space with the full disk space
2010-09-30T17:13:00.000Z	wild_oscar		 (no, I was  talking to adeola0405)
2010-09-30T17:13:00.000Z	adeola0405	wild_oscar	gparted reads 195.6gb total and 172 gb used and 23.3gbfree, df -h reads 190gb and 170gbused with 14 gb free
