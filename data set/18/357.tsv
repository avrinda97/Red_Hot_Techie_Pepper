2012-03-25T17:45:00.000Z	synergizm	remoteCTRL	yap
2012-03-25T17:45:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	synergizm	sorry but you cannot...
2012-03-25T17:46:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	synergizm	that is a setting that you can change according to your needs
2012-03-25T17:47:00.000Z	synergizm	remoteCTRL	where ? ^^
2012-03-25T17:47:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	synergizm	can you find the system settings dialog?
2012-03-25T17:47:00.000Z	synergizm	remoteCTRL	yeah
2012-03-25T17:48:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	synergizm	then open your eyes dude, you basically cannot overlook it;)
2012-03-25T17:48:00.000Z	synergizm	remoteCTRL	hmmm :/ i must be blind... u mean just clicking on system settings in the taskbar right? :D
2012-03-25T17:49:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	synergizm	nope, on the right upper corner of your screen there's the button that you normally click when you're looking to shutdown your computer, there is a menu item in there system settings, in there again you can configure unity, and there you have it on the very first page
2012-03-25T17:51:00.000Z	synergizm	remoteCTRL	that opens exactly the same dialogue ...personal, hardware ....
2012-03-25T17:51:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	synergizm	maybe, i dunno precisely...:)
2012-03-25T17:52:00.000Z	synergizm	remoteCTRL	only thing that sounds related to me is appearance but there i can only change the backround and the theme used nothing else
2012-03-25T17:53:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	synergizm	not what i meant, there is a menu item unity, or configure unity or so
2012-03-25T17:53:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	synergizm	geez, wait a minute...
2012-03-25T17:53:00.000Z	remoteCTRL	synergizm	got ccsm installed?
2012-03-25T17:53:00.000Z	synergizm	remoteCTRL	yes
