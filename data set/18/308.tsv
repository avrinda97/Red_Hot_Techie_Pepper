2012-04-27T07:59:00.000Z	ibfrog		yeah... I'm sure linux will run in extended... I just didn't follow the move to get rid of a boot partition.   Kinda seems like its an isolation method that ubuntu / canonical decided to get rid of more than anything else

2012-04-27T08:02:00.000Z	ibfrog		wow ruffleS thats new in 12.04

2012-04-27T08:04:00.000Z	ruffleS	ibfrog	i've been trying to find this bug report on launchpad with no luck so far
2012-04-27T08:05:00.000Z	ibfrog	ruffleS	think this was fixed in 11.0x but I've been running gnome-shell there and it acts different
2012-04-27T08:05:00.000Z	ruffleS	ibfrog	i've tried this on gnome-shell and bug doesn't apply there..

2012-04-27T08:08:00.000Z	ibfrog	ruffleS	I suppose I could ...  I've never lodged an ubuntu bug before and I wasn't planning on running unity for much longer
