2005-01-31T16:47:00.000Z	Quest-Master		this is so bad.
2005-01-31T16:48:00.000Z	Quest-Master		I deleted all of the pictures in the camera through Nautilus
2005-01-31T16:48:00.000Z	Quest-Master		And the camera is clean and empty
2005-01-31T16:48:00.000Z	Quest-Master		And now
2005-01-31T16:48:00.000Z	Quest-Master		On the LCD
2005-01-31T16:48:00.000Z	Quest-Master		The camera says there is no memory left
2005-01-31T16:48:00.000Z	Quest-Master		And Nautilus says there is still 1.4MB left
2005-01-31T16:48:00.000Z	Quest-Master		But there is supposed to be 64MB free
2005-01-31T16:48:00.000Z	drspin	Quest-Master	reformat the card with the camera
2005-01-31T16:49:00.000Z	drspin	Quest-Master	what kind of camera?
2005-01-31T16:50:00.000Z	drspin	Quest-Master	the flash card simple needs a filesystem (or file structure) that the camera supports on it
2005-03-16T15:50:00.000Z	drspin	Quest-Master	warty or hoary?
2005-03-16T15:50:00.000Z	drspin	Quest-Master	I would copy the /etc/X11/XF86Config-4 to /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2005-03-16T15:52:00.000Z	Quest-Master	drspin	should I restart GNOME now?
2005-03-16T15:53:00.000Z	drspin	Quest-Master	restart x [ctrl + alt + backspace] 
2005-03-16T16:07:00.000Z	drspin	Quest-Master	any luck?
