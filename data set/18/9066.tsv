2007-05-19T14:06:00.000Z	perlmonkey		how do you format a fd in linux?
2007-05-19T14:07:00.000Z	Frogzoo	perlmonkey	fdformat
2007-05-19T14:07:00.000Z	perlmonkey	Frogzoo	thanks
2007-05-19T14:08:00.000Z	Frogzoo	perlmonkey	ha ha
2007-05-19T14:08:00.000Z	perlmonkey	Frogzoo	:D
2007-05-19T14:09:00.000Z	Frogzoo	perlmonkey	actually, now I think of it, you might like to use the noatime option if you're using ext3
2007-05-19T14:09:00.000Z	perlmonkey	Frogzoo	ok
2007-06-17T06:26:00.000Z	Frogzoo	perlmonkey	nfs is pretty straightforward mostly
2007-06-17T06:27:00.000Z	perlmonkey	Frogzoo	i've had endless problems with it since I started mounting my /home folder...I even switched from Debian to Ubuntu
2007-06-17T06:27:00.000Z	Frogzoo	perlmonkey	tried the new automounter? autofs ?
2007-06-17T06:28:00.000Z	perlmonkey	Frogzoo	cool I will try it
2007-06-17T06:29:00.000Z	perlmonkey	Frogzoo	is there a danger to mounting using the nolock option?
2007-06-17T06:30:00.000Z	perlmonkey	Frogzoo	data integrity could be compromised if multiple users are trying to write to shared files?
2007-06-17T06:30:00.000Z	Frogzoo	perlmonkey	well, if the server crashes, you'll lose any non flushed data, but you can live with that for desktop use mostly
2007-06-17T09:22:00.000Z	Frogzoo	perlmonkey	sudo mount -a
2007-06-17T09:22:00.000Z	Frogzoo	perlmonkey	also man mount
2007-07-12T06:51:00.000Z	Frogzoo	perlmonkey	have you compared the RH clustered file system & XFS ?
2007-07-12T06:52:00.000Z	perlmonkey	Frogzoo	I don't know nothing about RH, my back ground is really only Debian before Ubuntu
