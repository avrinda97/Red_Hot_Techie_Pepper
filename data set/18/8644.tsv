2007-07-26T12:52:00.000Z	hexstar	PleaseHelpUbuntu	that can be caused by cheap media, what brand is that media?
2007-07-26T12:52:00.000Z	hexstar	PleaseHelpUbuntu	hmm...have you had the dvd's for a long time? Dvd-r's can rot after some time
2007-07-26T12:53:00.000Z	hexstar	PleaseHelpUbuntu	you might want to try buying some cd drive lens cleaning kit as the lens may be dirty
2007-07-26T12:53:00.000Z	hexstar	PleaseHelpUbuntu	but first make sure the drive is securely connected
2007-07-26T12:54:00.000Z	hexstar	PleaseHelpUbuntu	ok, then try buying one of those cd cleaning kits, it's probably dirty
2007-07-26T12:55:00.000Z	hexstar	PleaseHelpUbuntu	try buying a cd cleaning kit
2007-07-26T12:57:00.000Z	hexstar	PleaseHelpUbuntu	when you put in a cd/dvd do you here it spin up?
2007-07-26T12:57:00.000Z	hexstar	PleaseHelpUbuntu	A reboot would probably be a good idea, other then that I'd try reseating the drive and then swapping it with another known good one
