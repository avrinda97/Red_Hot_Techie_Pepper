2006-11-03T13:25:00.000Z	smoenux		can anyone tell me how I can install the previous version of my Nvidia Drivers? I cannot see them in the Package Manager.
2006-11-03T13:26:00.000Z	epsilon_	smoenux	try the nvidia.com site :)
2006-11-03T13:27:00.000Z	smoenux	epsilon_	I have, but those drivers are weird... they are asking me to compile some kernel or something, and I'm still noobish, and affraid to kill my system
2006-11-03T13:28:00.000Z	epsilon_	smoenux	yes it may :). why do you need those older drivers?
2006-11-03T13:29:00.000Z	smoenux	epsilon_	I need the old ones to fix a font problem I'm having with Guild-Wars in cedega
2006-11-03T13:29:00.000Z	epsilon_	smoenux	that MAY be cedega's fault are you absolutely sure its the nvidia?
2006-11-03T13:30:00.000Z	smoenux	epsilon_	I've been on all the forums and tried everything, on the one forum the guys were saying that the font problem is only with nvidia drivers 8xxx and that I need to install 7xxx
2006-11-03T13:34:00.000Z	smoenux	epsilon_	,  kk ... thankx
2006-11-03T13:35:00.000Z	epsilon_	smoenux	so firs install kernel headers and dl nvidia drivers.
2006-11-03T13:35:00.000Z	epsilon_	smoenux	THEN press ctrl-alt-f1 and login. then "sudo rm /tmp/.X0-lock" then "bash nvidia-driver....run"
2006-11-03T13:36:00.000Z	epsilon_	smoenux	*"sudo bash nvidia...run"
2006-11-03T13:39:00.000Z	smoenux	epsilon_	ok, I seem to have the headers install allready
2006-11-03T13:39:00.000Z	epsilon_	smoenux	cool. read what i said before then try to do it. :)
2006-11-03T13:39:00.000Z	epsilon_	smoenux	shall i write them down again?
2006-11-03T13:40:00.000Z	epsilon_	smoenux	okok :P
2006-11-03T13:41:00.000Z	epsilon_	smoenux	i hope it wont make you X crash. if so then in /etc/X11/xorg.conf, reset your driver from "nvidia" to "nv"
2006-11-03T13:42:00.000Z	smoenux	epsilon_	. yeah, I figured that :P .... that much at least I know
2006-11-03T13:43:00.000Z	epsilon_	smoenux	okok, sry, just in case you didnt know :)
