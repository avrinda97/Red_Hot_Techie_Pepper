2007-04-14T09:32:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	xtknight	not proper
2007-04-14T09:32:00.000Z	xtknight	Paddy_EIRE	how does ubuntu not have proper 64 bit support?  please elaborate, i'd love to hear.
2007-04-14T09:32:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	xtknight	mostly 32 bit apps running
2007-04-14T09:33:00.000Z	xtknight	Paddy_EIRE	 actually the whole amd64 image is full of 64-bit images.
2007-04-14T09:33:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	xtknight	care to point
2007-04-14T09:33:00.000Z	xtknight	Paddy_EIRE	hrm how did you deduce that they were 32bit?
2007-04-14T09:33:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	xtknight	you have used this right???
2007-04-14T09:34:00.000Z	xtknight	Paddy_EIRE	yea i have used amd64 ubuntu but i'm on i386 now
2007-04-14T09:34:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	xtknight	I think u should do ur homework mate ;)
2007-04-14T09:34:00.000Z	xtknight	Paddy_EIRE	type "file /path/to/executable" see if it says 32-bit LSB or 64-bit LSB ELF, and get back to me
2007-04-14T09:35:00.000Z	Paddy_EIRE	xtknight	there you go
