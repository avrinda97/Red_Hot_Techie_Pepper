2011-03-03T00:32:00.000Z	mbeierl		ok, I give up!  Why did my window controls (close/maximize/etc) suddenly move to the right side of the windows?!?  I like them on the left!
2011-03-03T00:33:00.000Z	Starminn	mbeierl	System->Preferences->Appearance->Choose one that suits your fancy.
2011-03-03T00:34:00.000Z	mbeierl	Starminn	all of them there have the controls on the right now.  This morning things were on the left then I did an apt-update and my appearances changed to the right?
2011-03-03T00:36:00.000Z	mbeierl	Starminn	fyi: http://pastebin.com/62D4F1z8 for my appearances preferences.  no choice there...
2011-03-03T00:37:00.000Z	Starminn	mbeierl	That is illegible.
2011-03-03T00:37:00.000Z	Starminn	mbeierl	Are you using Emerald?
2011-03-03T00:37:00.000Z	mbeierl	Starminn	sorry - here: http://imagebin.org/140787
2011-03-03T00:37:00.000Z	mbeierl	Starminn	compiz.
2011-03-03T00:41:00.000Z	Starminn	mbeierl	I just did it. Try typing in "metacity --replace"
2011-03-03T00:41:00.000Z	mbeierl	Starminn	ok.  icons are still on the right.  now what?
2011-03-03T00:43:00.000Z	Starminn	mbeierl	Go to CompizConfig and make sure that "Window Decorator" is on the default (just click on the default button thingy)
2011-03-03T00:44:00.000Z	mbeierl	Starminn	it's on.  Turned it off, waited, back on... Still on the right.  I'm stumped.
2011-03-03T00:45:00.000Z	Starminn	mbeierl	This is the steps I took just a moment ago to get it to work. I went o CompizConfig->Window Decorator-> and reset the "Command" field to the default, I typed in "metacity --replace" in a Terminal, then went to System->Preferences->Appearance and chose the default "Ambience."
2011-03-03T00:45:00.000Z	Starminn	mbeierl	Try those, and let us know how it goes.
2011-03-03T00:48:00.000Z	Starminn	mbeierl	For your reference, whenever you use Compiz, it replaces Metacity which is the default window title bar handler. So, if it happens again, just make sure compiz knows to leave the windows to Metacity and butt out of its business! ;)
2011-03-03T00:49:00.000Z	Starminn	mbeierl	Glad it worked for you, though. Hooray! :) Have fun with the buttons where you like 'em.
2011-03-03T00:49:00.000Z	mbeierl	Starminn	the odd thing is that it just happened without warning today.  Been using ubuntu and compiz since the beryl days and never had this happen.  But thanks for the tip!
2011-03-03T00:50:00.000Z	Starminn	mbeierl	Yes, I'm not sure why it happened either, and when I initially tried using themes where the buttons were on the left it wouldn't work for me either so you're not alone. It's odd, but it works now and that's all that matters.
