2009-12-23T16:24:00.000Z	madrazr		Hello everyone, from yesterday suddenly my LVMs are not mounting during boot even though I have their entries in fstab, can any one help me with this please?
2009-12-23T16:25:00.000Z	Brandano	madrazr	that's sincerely something I never faced. Do they show up fine in gparted?
2009-12-23T16:25:00.000Z	madrazr	Brandano	yup, I can even mount them manually after loggin in
2009-12-23T16:26:00.000Z	Brandano	madrazr	 something changed at user permission level?
2009-12-23T16:26:00.000Z	madrazr	Brandano	not that I know of at least, and no one else uses this machine other than me
2009-12-23T16:27:00.000Z	madrazr	Brandano	is there any log I can check out for this?
2009-12-23T16:27:00.000Z	Brandano	madrazr	but when mounting them manually do you have to enter your password?
2009-12-23T16:28:00.000Z	madrazr	Brandano	yup, I have to mount it as root
2009-12-23T16:28:00.000Z	Brandano	madrazr	then you don't have the proper permissions for automounting as regular user in fstab
2009-12-23T16:28:00.000Z	madrazr	Brandano	Oh! what should I do for that?
2009-12-23T16:29:00.000Z	Brandano	madrazr	looking it up, gimme a sec.
2009-12-23T16:30:00.000Z	madrazr	Brandano	sure, thank you so much
2009-12-23T16:38:00.000Z	Brandano	madrazr	essentially you ought to have "user" in the fstab options for th specific partitions
2009-12-23T16:38:00.000Z	Brandano	madrazr	to allow mounting as a user
2009-12-23T16:38:00.000Z	madrazr	Brandano	Oh Ok
2009-12-23T16:40:00.000Z	madrazr	Brandano	Oh Ok
2009-12-23T16:41:00.000Z	Brandano	madrazr	I hope it works. Try unmounting and remounting manually before rebooting
2009-12-23T16:41:00.000Z	madrazr	Brandano	sure
