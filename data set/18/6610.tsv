2008-10-11T19:13:00.000Z	amikrop		OK. A simple, but vital question, I think: I have a DELL Latitude D800 (or, any other random laptop). I don't have an external microphone that I plugged in. I just want to record sound from the device built into my laptop. What should I turn on in "Volume Control"? Micriphone? Capture? Line-In? Something else?
2008-10-11T19:13:00.000Z	amikrop		* microphone
2008-10-11T19:13:00.000Z	emorris	amikrop	you need to use the recording not playback tab
2008-10-11T19:14:00.000Z	amikrop	emorris	OK, I already know this.
2008-10-11T19:14:00.000Z	amikrop	emorris	But what should I enable there?
2008-10-11T19:15:00.000Z	emorris	amikrop	have you just tried each thing? also check in edit>preferences that they are all ticked
2008-10-11T19:16:00.000Z	amikrop	emorris	Do you use a laptop?
2008-10-11T19:16:00.000Z	emorris	amikrop	yes
2008-10-11T19:16:00.000Z	amikrop	emorris	can you record sound?
2008-10-11T19:16:00.000Z	emorris	amikrop	yes
2008-10-11T19:17:00.000Z	emorris	amikrop	try running alsamixer from the command line for a more retro mixer
2008-10-11T19:18:00.000Z	emorris	amikrop	then press tab to go to recording
2008-10-11T19:18:00.000Z	amikrop	emorris	ok, done
2008-10-11T19:18:00.000Z	amikrop	emorris	then?
2008-10-11T19:20:00.000Z	emorris	amikrop	i think it's space to select the one you want
2008-10-11T19:20:00.000Z	amikrop	emorris	I don't "want" something. I "need" something, to make it work, and I don't know what is the one I need. :)
2008-10-11T19:21:00.000Z	emorris	amikrop	well try each one in turn, every computer is different
2008-10-11T19:21:00.000Z	amikrop	emorris	ok
