2010-01-28T18:27:00.000Z	Justin_`		Will my netgear wireless adapter work fine aswell?
2010-01-28T18:27:00.000Z	Justin_`		Ah ok.
2010-01-28T18:28:00.000Z	Justin_`		Damn you guys are really helpful and fast
2010-01-28T18:28:00.000Z	Justin_`		haha :)
2010-01-28T18:28:00.000Z	Justin_`		How much ram would it use just running the OS?
2010-01-28T18:29:00.000Z	Justin_`		Do you have to have the CD in to use the OS?
2010-01-28T18:30:00.000Z	Justin_`		Ah ok awesome :)
2010-01-28T18:31:00.000Z	Justin_`		Yeah I am downloading the ISO, burning it onto a CD then installing it
2010-01-28T18:31:00.000Z	Justin_`		But I thought you said you need to have the 'live cd' in to use the OS
2010-01-28T18:31:00.000Z	scunizi	Justin_`	you on a win machine now?
2010-01-28T18:27:00.000Z	scunizi	Justin_`	unless they are logitec.. then some have issues..
2010-01-28T18:28:00.000Z	scunizi	Justin_`	that's why we get the big bucks :)
2010-01-28T18:29:00.000Z	scunizi	Justin_`	the live cd I think requires 384 to run.. server 256.. but the more the merrier..
2010-01-28T18:29:00.000Z	scunizi	Justin_`	those are minimums
2010-01-28T18:30:00.000Z	scunizi	Justin_`	but then how you gonna get it?  .. you could download the iso and put it on a usb stick instead of a cd
2010-01-28T18:33:00.000Z	scunizi	Justin_`	ok.. the live cd allow you to boot from it.  You'll be able to run the os right from the cd.. it's slower (much) but a good way to test it... also burning the iso is different from data. if your burning software doesn't support iso images. just google for windows iso burner.. when burning do it at the slowest speed possible..
2010-01-28T18:35:00.000Z	scunizi	Justin_`	there you go .. Dr_Willis had ubottu give you a link that might be helpful
