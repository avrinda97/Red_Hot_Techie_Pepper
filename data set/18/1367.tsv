2011-03-16T21:51:00.000Z	Guest40473		How do you change the Hibernate device in 10.10?
2011-03-16T21:52:00.000Z	Guest40473		The official documentation looks dead & unmaintained
2011-03-16T21:53:00.000Z	llutz	Guest40473	change it in /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/resume    and run "sudo update-initramfs" then
2011-03-16T22:33:00.000Z	Guest40473	llutz	i was able to keep the same UUID for the hibernate device, (no need to update /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/resume) but suspend still does not work, in pm-suspend.log i get: "s2disk: Could not use the resume device (try swapon -a). Reason: No such device"
2011-03-16T22:33:00.000Z	Guest40473		with no other error
2011-03-16T22:34:00.000Z	llutz	Guest40473	aren't you using that hibernation-device as swap?
2011-03-16T22:34:00.000Z	Guest40473	llutz	yes, it shows up in /proc/swaps
2011-03-16T22:35:00.000Z	Guest40473	llutz	swaps says sda7, and ls -l /dev/disk/by-uuid/ says that the 3b0f54* UUID
2011-03-16T22:36:00.000Z	Guest40473		maps to sda7
2011-03-16T22:36:00.000Z	llutz	Guest40473	 and thats the UUID the resume-file contains? no idea what's wrong with that, sorry
2011-03-16T22:37:00.000Z	Guest40473		yep,  cat /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/resume     prints RESUME=UUID=3b0f54c5-349b-48a7-a4d8-7bda3b3d9f03
2011-03-16T22:37:00.000Z	Guest40473		wait
2011-03-16T22:37:00.000Z	Guest40473		if i need to update initramfs
2011-03-16T22:38:00.000Z	Guest40473		(or would have)
2011-03-16T22:38:00.000Z	Guest40473		mean a shutdown/reboot must be required for some reason?
2011-03-16T22:38:00.000Z	Guest40473		so hibernate must still be thinking that this UUID maps to sda8, because that is what it mapped to on boot?
2011-03-16T22:38:00.000Z	Guest40473		bleh
2011-03-16T22:39:00.000Z	llutz	Guest40473	that's possible, reboot to check
