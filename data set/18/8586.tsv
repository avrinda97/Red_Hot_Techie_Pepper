2011-07-17T12:22:00.000Z	nikolam		I have a STRANGE problem. Suddenly, after LTS is updated (and new virtualbox is installed, as well) on Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, i can not use PING command.
2011-07-17T12:22:00.000Z	nikolam		ping: icmp open socket: Operation not permitted
2011-07-17T12:24:00.000Z	nikolam		Fossilet,
2011-07-17T12:24:00.000Z	Fossilet	nikolam	ls -l /bin/ping?
2011-07-17T12:25:00.000Z	Fossilet	nikolam	it's already set root uid.
2011-07-17T12:27:00.000Z	Fossilet	nikolam	have you rebooted?
2011-07-17T12:27:00.000Z	nikolam	Fossilet	yes
2011-07-17T12:29:00.000Z	Fossilet	nikolam	I mean -v, verbose mode?
2011-07-17T12:30:00.000Z	nikolam	Fossilet	same thing, ping works only with sudo
2011-07-17T12:30:00.000Z	Fossilet	nikolam	interesing..
2011-07-17T12:35:00.000Z	nikolam	Fossilet	previous to that, firestarter started behaving strangely not being able to start firewall upon ppp0 lisng established. And I was always having icmp filtered and only echo to put in and I was surfing rof few hours without that filter, And now that filter is eather on or off, ping do not work. Maybe it is firefox versus new ubuntu updates.
2011-07-17T12:36:00.000Z	Fossilet	nikolam	I do not know why it's not permitted even it's set root id.
2011-07-17T12:37:00.000Z	Fossilet	nikolam	Desktop?
2011-07-17T12:37:00.000Z	Fossilet	nikolam	We may be using the same ping binary
2011-07-17T12:38:00.000Z	Fossilet	nikolam	not the same, though the same size.
2011-07-17T12:39:00.000Z	Fossilet	nikolam	Ok.
2011-07-17T12:41:00.000Z	nikolam	Fossilet	it is 64-bit LTS here
2011-07-17T12:41:00.000Z	nikolam	Fossilet	fping works.
