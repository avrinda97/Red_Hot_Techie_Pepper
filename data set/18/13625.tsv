2006-05-04T11:14:00.000Z	mavric2001		why would you spend 2500 on a mac to run linux on
2006-05-04T11:14:00.000Z	mavric2001		bs
2006-05-04T11:14:00.000Z	mavric2001		it isnt any better than pc hardware, specially if you build your own
2006-05-04T11:15:00.000Z	luisito	mavric2001	I want to say good bye forever to windows but I need the design software I can't have in linux (yet). so I need a mac.
2006-05-04T11:16:00.000Z	mavric2001		hell mac is intel now, lol, I repeat your purchasing over priced hardware
2006-05-04T11:17:00.000Z	mavric2001		jobs stole from BSD
2006-05-04T11:17:00.000Z	luisito	mavric2001	yep!, I know it's an overpriced hardware but the system worth the money.
2006-05-04T11:17:00.000Z	mavric2001		im not trashing hardware, the hardware is cheaper on the pc platform for the same stuff
2006-05-04T11:18:00.000Z	mavric2001		so are you

2006-05-04T11:21:00.000Z	mavric2001		just because you have a god complex doesnt make you less gay

2006-05-04T11:23:00.000Z	mavric2001		people who think macs are faster than x86 platforms in any configuration are funny
2006-05-04T11:23:00.000Z	mavric2001		now that they are intel, maybe close to the fastest x86s but not really faster
