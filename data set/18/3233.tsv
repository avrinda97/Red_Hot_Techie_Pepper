2009-11-11T22:23:00.000Z	mahngiel	Take0n	just looks like the scripting has errors in it, since it doesn't recognize a style

2009-11-11T22:24:00.000Z	Take0n		well it worked yesterday I don't remember doing something other than maybe applying a new theme

2009-11-11T22:25:00.000Z	mahngiel	Take0n	perhaps the theme was written incorrectly
