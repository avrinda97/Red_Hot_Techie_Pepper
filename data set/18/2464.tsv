2010-05-14T09:36:00.000Z	RagnarokAngel	Dizz	Did you install wine as root?
2010-05-14T09:37:00.000Z	Dizz	RagnarokAngel	im pretty sure. i got it from the software center
2010-05-14T09:37:00.000Z	RagnarokAngel	Dizz	No that shouldn't have installed it as root.
2010-05-14T09:38:00.000Z	Dizz	RagnarokAngel	ahh okay how do i install as root then? ill un install throu the software center
2010-05-14T09:38:00.000Z	RagnarokAngel	Dizz	No, the permissions thing would have been if you installed as root, which would have been that problem.
2010-05-14T09:39:00.000Z	Dizz	RagnarokAngel	i un-installed wine . how do i install as root?
2010-05-14T09:39:00.000Z	RagnarokAngel	Dizz	You don't want to. You should install from the beta channel though â€” winehq.org
2010-05-14T09:40:00.000Z	Dizz	RagnarokAngel	dont do it throu the terminal?
