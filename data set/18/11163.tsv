2006-09-02T09:29:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	glassbits	I can crack it if it's not shadowed
2006-09-02T09:29:00.000Z	glassbits	DJAdmiral	how do i know if its not shadowed
2006-09-02T09:29:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	glassbits	do you see a line like root:x:someblahblah?
2006-09-02T09:30:00.000Z	glassbits	DJAdmiral	ya
2006-09-02T09:30:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	glassbits	or do you see a line like root:blahblah:blahblah
2006-09-02T09:30:00.000Z	glassbits	DJAdmiral	here it is  -> glassbits:x:1000:1000:Glass Bits,,,:/home/glassbits:/bin/bas
2006-09-02T09:31:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	glassbits	then you have a problem
2006-09-02T09:31:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	glassbits	it's shadowed
2006-09-02T09:31:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	glassbits	in this case you have to boot into recovery mode
2006-09-02T09:31:00.000Z	glassbits	DJAdmiral	and then ?
2006-09-02T09:31:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	glassbits	in which you shall gain only text based access to root, and a way to see your /etc/passwd unshadowed
2006-09-02T09:33:00.000Z	glassbits	DJAdmiral	so if i do nano /etc/passwd i can view that password ?
2006-09-02T09:33:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	glassbits	in your current situation? I don't think so
2006-09-02T09:33:00.000Z	glassbits	DJAdmiral	can i change my current password from recovery mode ?
2006-09-02T09:34:00.000Z	DJAdmiral	glassbits	think so
2006-09-02T09:34:00.000Z	glassbits	DJAdmiral	thanks i will try that and get back
