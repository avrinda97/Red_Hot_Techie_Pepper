2011-01-20T12:24:00.000Z	cache_surplus		i like more or less :)

2011-01-20T12:24:00.000Z	cache_surplus		ill think about it
2011-01-20T12:26:00.000Z	cache_surplus		lolol DasEi
2011-01-20T12:27:00.000Z	cache_surplus		i think cat is faster than more or less, i mean at spitting out info, rather than paging through it
2011-01-20T12:27:00.000Z	cache_surplus		the only time i like to use cat is in DasEi's example or if im doing a grep, but really less does the same thing at my level of understanding
2011-01-20T12:28:00.000Z	cache_surplus		i couldnt tell the diff of cat and less, can anyone?
2011-01-20T12:28:00.000Z	cache_surplus		on a flat file i mean?
2011-01-20T12:28:00.000Z	greppy	cache_surplus	most uses of cat and grep are redundant, just an fyi
2011-01-20T12:29:00.000Z	cache_surplus	greppy	my thoughts.. example i did a select * from a table in mysql, without setting pager to more/less and i was there for like 10 mins... waiting
2011-01-20T12:29:00.000Z	cache_surplus	greppy	correct.
