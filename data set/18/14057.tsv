2005-09-23T06:09:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	thewayofzen	: if xmms doesnt work change the audio out from esd to alsa
2005-09-23T06:09:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	thewayofzen	: blackbox is leet tho, no clutter and stupid things.
2005-09-23T06:10:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	thewayofzen	: run esd or change the audio out to alsa not esd for those apps...
2005-09-23T06:11:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	thewayofzen	: am sure it has an option somewhere...
2005-09-23T06:12:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	thewayofzen	: <robotgeek> thewayofzen: open up a terminal and type esd &
2005-10-21T09:14:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	thewayofzen	: not the cvs, but did 70rc
2005-10-21T09:18:00.000Z	thewayofzen	lsuactiafner	did you have to make any changes to have it recognise your artwiz fonts?
2005-10-21T09:19:00.000Z	thewayofzen	lsuactiafner	currently the packages from the breezy repos recognise my artwiz.. but when i do cvs build.. it wont antialias.. nor will it recognise the fonts as defined in the style
2005-10-21T09:19:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	thewayofzen	: might be since you are running the wrong binary
2005-10-21T09:20:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	thewayofzen	: updatedb ; locate blackbox | grep bin ; which blackbox
2005-10-21T09:20:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	thewayofzen	: might show you that there are two binaries and according to "which" you are running the wrong one
2005-10-21T09:20:00.000Z	thewayofzen	lsuactiafner	i actually apt-get removed blackbox from the repos first
2005-10-21T09:21:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	thewayofzen	: am implying there might be two, and that you are running the wrong one
2005-10-21T09:22:00.000Z	thewayofzen	lsuactiafner	im saying there is only the one binary though.
2005-10-21T09:22:00.000Z	lsuactiafner	thewayofzen	: ./configure --help then
