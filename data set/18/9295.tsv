2007-10-08T08:08:00.000Z	binary64		seveas: how? i wondered the same
2007-10-08T08:09:00.000Z	binary64		ah
2007-10-08T08:09:00.000Z	binary64		imho it's not a preference, but a view mode..
2007-10-08T08:09:00.000Z	binary64		:D
2007-10-08T08:10:00.000Z	binary64		when i develop in notepad on windows, i always swap between. annoyingly though, in notepad, after toggling, it jumps to first line :(
2007-10-08T08:10:00.000Z	binary64		why would it be ignored?
2007-10-08T08:11:00.000Z	binary64		cos i'm not IBM? <grin>
2007-10-08T08:11:00.000Z	binary64		ah i see
2007-10-08T08:11:00.000Z	binary64		what is more receptive? kde?
2007-10-08T08:12:00.000Z	binary64		anyone thought of making a linux distro where ANYONE can change the code like a wiki.. or public anonymous writable svn...
2007-10-08T08:12:00.000Z	trogdor	binary64	kde has more coupling than explorer.exe and gnome yeah reputation ignoring feature requests and hiding gui options
2007-10-08T08:37:00.000Z	trogdor	binary64	you don't login to gnome as root, you get a terminal and escalate its privileges to root and do your business
2007-10-08T08:38:00.000Z	trogdor	binary64	no binary64, things running as root are things like drivers and the system itself. In vista you don't have access to those as much as you would like
2007-10-08T08:39:00.000Z	trogdor	binary64	anything running as root can install whatever it likes and interfere with other programs processes... only things that require such control should have it
2007-10-08T08:41:00.000Z	trogdor	binary64	oh all you have to do is login as root and do rm -R your whole system deleted then
2007-10-08T08:41:00.000Z	trogdor	binary64	in other operating systems you can't delete running processes though
2007-10-08T08:43:00.000Z	trogdor	binary64	dude.. you want root privileges to yourself not every app that dare tread your system :/
2007-10-08T08:45:00.000Z	trogdor	binary64	look if you want to run programs as root that's fine but running every damn thing you have as it, just doesn't make any sense..
