2008-04-28T20:29:00.000Z	sweatshopking		I need some help with grub, i deleted a windows partition on one of my drives so that i could extend my ext3, and now grub wont load it says error 55. is there a way to restore my grub loader without a complete reinstall? i would really like to keep my windows installation as well. i see now taht i shoudl have deleted the windows partition in ubuntu rather than in windows.

2008-04-28T20:33:00.000Z	LjL	sweatshopking	mount | grep "on / type "
2008-04-28T20:35:00.000Z	LjL	sweatshopking	pastebin the output of "mount"
2008-04-28T20:38:00.000Z	LjL	sweatshopking	wait so you have no root directory...? :o)
2008-04-28T20:39:00.000Z	LjL	sweatshopking	look can you explain the entire problem from the beginning, in one line? i don't quite have a clear picture of it
2008-04-28T20:42:00.000Z	LjL	sweatshopking	i'd suggest using the smart boot manager to boot into your ubuntu, and then "grub-install" from there

2008-04-28T20:43:00.000Z	LjL	sweatshopking	see the link above. you download sbm.bin, and then from the live CD, you create a floppy by doing "dd if=sbm.bin of=/dev/fd0"
2008-04-28T20:46:00.000Z	LjL	sweatshopking	then you can probably use it by burning it to a CD instead. type "sudo apt-get install sbm bmconf", and then run "bmconf", it should help you configure it and burn it to a CD
