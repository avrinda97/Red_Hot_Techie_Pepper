2011-02-04T08:45:00.000Z	heslam		hey guys. i'm looking for help connecting to two different networks (two routers, one leading to the internet and one just to connect to other computers) with ubuntu and i'm struggling to get it right. is this too general a question?
2011-02-04T08:45:00.000Z	heslam		perhaps i should go to #networking or something
2011-02-04T08:46:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	heslam	##networking actually.
2011-02-04T08:46:00.000Z	heslam	KB1JWQ	cool, thanks :)
2011-02-04T08:46:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	heslam	And it depends upon what you're trying to do.
2011-02-04T08:46:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	heslam	The answer is going to be "fix your routing table" wherever you ask.
2011-02-04T08:47:00.000Z	heslam	KB1JWQ	right, okay. well i'll research routing tables, then! thanks :)
2011-02-04T08:49:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	heslam	And the local router is wired?
2011-02-04T08:49:00.000Z	heslam	KB1JWQ	yep
2011-02-04T08:49:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	heslam	Assign a separate IP range to the wired interface on both machines.  As long as they're both within the same subnet that should be all you need to do.
2011-02-04T08:50:00.000Z	heslam	KB1JWQ	i'm pretty sure i did that, unless i'm ignorant as to exactly how to assign seperate IP ranges...
2011-02-04T08:51:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	heslam	ifconfig -a to a pastebin then!
2011-02-04T08:52:00.000Z	heslam	KB1JWQ	i don't actually have the network set up how i'd like it - whenever i connect them both to the wired router, they are no longer able to access the internet over the wireless router. so sending you the ifconfig + netstat -r data becomes a little bit difficult :P
2011-02-04T08:52:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	heslam	Ah, you're running network-manager.
2011-02-04T08:53:00.000Z	heslam	KB1JWQ	yeah, i'm using a stock ubuntu install (and linux mint lxde for the laptop, but yeah). so network-manager screws with this sort of thing?
2011-02-04T08:53:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	heslam	Network-manager screws with bloody EVERYTHING.
2011-02-04T08:54:00.000Z	KB1JWQ	heslam	I'd check out #nm
2011-02-04T08:54:00.000Z	heslam	KB1JWQ	gotcha :P thanks :)
