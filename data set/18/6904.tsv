2008-03-07T19:43:00.000Z	beerdeaap	cl3tUs	~ is your homedir, normally executables are in /usr/bin
2008-03-07T19:44:00.000Z	beerdeaap	cl3tUs	just type "locate gcc" or "which gcc" it should give you the path to gcc
2008-03-07T19:50:00.000Z	beerdeaap	cl3tUs	~/ is your homedir (i.e. /home/c3tUs/ )
2008-03-07T19:57:00.000Z	cl3tUs	beerdeaap	 I am reading an article that kept telling me to do stuff with "sudo", so I figured I'd just use "su" and identify myself as root.
2008-03-07T19:58:00.000Z	beerdeaap	cl3tUs	okay that makes sense then since the homefolder of root is normally /root (but indeed it is not a good idea to su)
2008-03-07T20:00:00.000Z	beerdeaap	cl3tUs	if you want to know if a command is available just type 'which <commandname>' and it will show you where iit is.
2008-03-07T20:03:00.000Z	beerdeaap	cl3tUs	you're welcome :)
2008-03-07T20:06:00.000Z	beerdeaap	cl3tUs	what are you trying to do ?
2008-03-07T20:10:00.000Z	cl3tUs	beerdeaap	and brobostigon: I use a Linux Preboot for my Altiris Deployment Server.  I need to add the DC7700 SFF nic drivers to my PXE, but can't without the .ko files.  So I foun this huge process to try to get gcc-3.4 just to get to where I can get the .ko files for the 7700 sff.
2008-03-07T20:11:00.000Z	beerdeaap	cl3tUs	sorry dude can't help you there
2008-03-07T20:15:00.000Z	beerdeaap	cl3tUs	some linux distros have lots of modules that it can load at boot time.. Some kernel builds might have no support for certain Nics
2008-03-07T20:16:00.000Z	beerdeaap	cl3tUs	you can't just copy a module from one kernel to the other
2008-03-07T20:19:00.000Z	cl3tUs	beerdeaap	 Thats what scares me.  I mean, for Altiris, I just have to add the .ko files.  I'm reading this site "https://kb.altiris.com/display/1n/articleDirect/index.asp?aid=28260&r=0.1100122" to get them  If that doesn't work, just search "28260" in the search.  That's how I export the .ko and get it into my server, which is a Windows 2003.
2008-03-07T20:43:00.000Z	cl3tUs	beerdeaap	 When you say kernal, do you mean "Linux 2.6.16.20" ?
2008-03-07T20:44:00.000Z	beerdeaap	cl3tUs	 yup the number is the version number, make sure those are the same when exchanging modules ! .
2008-03-07T20:47:00.000Z	cl3tUs	beerdeaap	 If I go to my folder where those .ko files are in the "Drivers" folder, will they be in there?  It's located in my respective Linux version folder.  If it is there, what do  I look for?  There's a ton of .ko files.
