2009-02-08T07:02:00.000Z	cricri		i mounted my usb key in /mnt how do i go back to the intstall
2009-02-08T07:03:00.000Z	terr_	cricri	??? rephrase the question please
2009-02-08T07:03:00.000Z	terr_	cricri	I would think umount it and remount where you want it
2009-02-08T07:03:00.000Z	terr_	cricri	I've never done this however for a USB key
2009-02-08T07:06:00.000Z	terr_	cricri	does the ubuntu installer go through a boot?
2009-02-08T07:06:00.000Z	terr_	cricri	it will lose everything iduring the reboot of course
2009-02-08T07:07:00.000Z	terr_	cricri	I presume you realise this?
2009-02-08T07:07:00.000Z	terr_	cricri	yes - but if the machine reboots between when you mount the USB key and run the installer then the mount is lost
2009-02-08T07:09:00.000Z	terr_	cricri	and no reboot after that?
2009-02-08T07:09:00.000Z	terr_	cricri	ok - we are past that hurdle then.  I was worrying about you needing to make a new initrd with drivers and so forth
2009-02-08T07:10:00.000Z	terr_	cricri	have ytou tried appending blah to the path?  You will need to use "source" if via a script or .blah
2009-02-08T07:12:00.000Z	terr_	cricri	??
2009-02-08T07:12:00.000Z	terr_	cricri	perhaps yes - the path in the boot options.  look at the paths the installer sees
2009-02-08T07:13:00.000Z	terr_	cricri	the installer is just a program and when it looks for stuff it will look in hard coded places - configured places and maybe on a path
2009-02-08T07:14:00.000Z	terr_	cricri	you might also be able to cd to /mnt/blah and then run the installer
2009-02-08T07:14:00.000Z	terr_	cricri	whatever it is - its likely to be simple
2009-02-08T07:16:00.000Z	terr_	cricri	are you making headway?
2009-02-08T07:18:00.000Z	terr_	cricri	np
