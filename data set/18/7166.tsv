2008-04-03T08:48:00.000Z	unop_	sCOTTo	what happens when you try and access the windows machines?
2008-04-03T08:49:00.000Z	sCOTTo	unop_	i cant do anything with them
2008-04-03T08:49:00.000Z	sCOTTo	unop_	im no expert with linux - I forsook Windows vista for ubuntu as a supporter of death to windows....
2008-04-03T08:50:00.000Z	unop_	sCOTTo	ok, given that you know the name or ipaddress of one of your windows machines .. what happens when you type this into the nautilus location bar.  smb://othermachinename
2008-04-03T08:50:00.000Z	sCOTTo	unop_	is there a gui that will help me hook into the shares on my network?
2008-04-03T08:50:00.000Z	sCOTTo	unop_	irefox ok?
2008-04-03T08:51:00.000Z	unop_	sCOTTo	nautilus does it - firefox no, i believe there is something else on gnome (gnome-connect-server maybe) i can't remember what exactly
2008-04-03T08:52:00.000Z	unop_	sCOTTo	anyway, we'll get to that once we have troubleshooted this? what happens when you browse to smb://   and  smb://othermachinename  ??

2008-04-05T11:25:00.000Z	unop_	sCOTTo	what does the eps file contain? do you know?

2008-04-05T11:27:00.000Z	unop_	sCOTTo	i remember something called pstoedit, can't remember what package it was from that could work with eps file -- have a browse on packages.ubuntu.com
2008-04-05T11:30:00.000Z	unop_	sCOTTo	 apt-cache search eps # -throws up quite a few packages that seem to work with eps files
