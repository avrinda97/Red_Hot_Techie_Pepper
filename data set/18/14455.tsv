2005-08-23T15:28:00.000Z	bina		where is my 'X config' file? also, does Ubuntu use Xorg ?
2005-08-23T15:28:00.000Z	Ng	bina	/etc/X11/xorg.conf and yes
2005-08-23T15:29:00.000Z	bina	Ng	thanks
2005-08-23T15:37:00.000Z	Ng	bina	the nvidia drivers can accelerate the Composite X extension, but very little uses it so far and it's quite experimental. if you mean terminal transparencies.... no
2005-08-23T15:38:00.000Z	bina	Ng	well i think its the composite extension, for the KDE 3.4 translucency effect?
2005-08-23T15:39:00.000Z	Ng	bina	not sure, don't use KDE
2005-08-23T15:39:00.000Z	bina	Ng	oh right, k.  Well, ill try, see what happens
2005-10-24T08:03:00.000Z	Ng	bina	it's probably in the main package
2005-10-24T08:03:00.000Z	bina	Ng	hmm, do i need to enable it in some conf file then? according to phpinfo tisnt enabled
2005-10-24T08:04:00.000Z	Ng	bina	possibly. There's also mod-proxy, maybe it's that in apache2, I'm not actually sure to be honest.
2005-10-24T08:05:00.000Z	bina	Ng	k, well ill try a rule then if it doesnt work ill install that.  Thanks
2005-11-06T17:50:00.000Z	Ng	bina	not really, there are some complex procedures you can use if you search google for ext3 undelete
2005-11-06T17:51:00.000Z	bina	Ng	oh well, ill just retype it :) not really that bothered about it :P
2005-11-06T17:51:00.000Z	Ng	bina	it sounds patronising, but this is why there's a wastebasket ;)
2005-11-06T17:52:00.000Z	bina	Ng	lol i guess so :)
2006-02-23T07:49:00.000Z	Ng	bina	depends on the laptop, some have some pretty unsupported hardware
2006-02-23T07:50:00.000Z	Ng	bina	but there's an ubuntu laptop testing team and www.linux-laptop.net so you can check compatibility quite easily
2006-02-23T07:50:00.000Z	bina	Ng	oh right, sweet.  thanks
