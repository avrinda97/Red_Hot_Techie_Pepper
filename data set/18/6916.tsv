2008-07-12T08:01:00.000Z	rnartos		can anyone help me??
2008-07-12T08:01:00.000Z	rnartos		I just done mistakke in kernel...
2008-07-12T08:02:00.000Z	rnartos		I execute "make modules" then.. stop it in the middle of process and do "make driver/.../.../asdasd" then perform "make modules_install"
2008-07-12T08:02:00.000Z	rnartos		after a reboot, my mouse, network and sound not working
2008-07-12T08:02:00.000Z	rnartos		so should I do "make clean", "make modules" and "make modules_install" again to fix that??
2008-07-12T08:04:00.000Z	rnartos		the problem is that I never execute "make clean" after that mistake
2008-07-12T08:05:00.000Z	rnartos		I wish there's an expert in recompiling Kernel here
2008-07-12T08:05:00.000Z	rnartos		but end messing the whole system
2008-07-12T08:06:00.000Z	cirkit	rnartos	There are people in here who know how to compile a kernel.
2008-07-12T08:06:00.000Z	rnartos	cirkit	can you help me?
2008-07-12T08:06:00.000Z	cirkit	rnartos	What is the problem?
2008-07-12T08:06:00.000Z	cirkit	rnartos	http://www.digitalhermit.com/linux/Kernel-Build-HOWTO.html#PREPARATION
2008-07-12T08:07:00.000Z	cirkit	rnartos	Please bookmark that web link as it is a great resource to learn how to compile a kernel.
2008-07-12T08:07:00.000Z	rnartos	cirkit	 I perform  "make modules" but STOPPED it in the middle of the process then execute "make driver/.../..asd../" then do "make modules_install"
2008-07-12T08:07:00.000Z	rnartos	cirkit	 but the problem after a reboot... the network, mouse and sound not working anymore
2008-07-12T08:11:00.000Z	cirkit	rnartos	Once you have finished with "make menuconfig", please double check and ensure all your modules are selected like your sound, video, and anything else you say doesn't work after reboot. After this is completed, "make dep", "make clean", "make bzImage", "make modules", "sudo make modules_install" - I do highly recommend taking a look at that link I gave you too, as it explains what all this does.
2008-07-12T08:12:00.000Z	cirkit	rnartos	this might be more benefical to read first as it is more closely related to the "Ubuntu" way @ https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Kernel/Compile
2008-07-12T08:14:00.000Z	rnartos	cirkit	thanks
