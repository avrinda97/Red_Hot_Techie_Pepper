2006-06-08T10:28:00.000Z	cdubya		I need to setup a cron job to cp some dirs for backup on a nightly basis, and I was looking at the options for cp and it has the -R option, which I thought would allow me to set it to backup every day at a given time....
2006-06-08T10:28:00.000Z	cdubya		I thought I had it setup right, but when I tested it the other day, the recursion didn't seem to work......
2006-06-08T10:29:00.000Z	orbin	cdubya	is this a headless box?
2006-06-08T10:29:00.000Z	cdubya	orbin	nope
2006-06-08T10:30:00.000Z	cdubya	orbin	I had setup the job in cron.daily......
2006-06-08T10:30:00.000Z	cdubya	orbin	and it copied my first test of just a single folder.....
2006-06-08T10:30:00.000Z	cdubya	orbin	but when I went to try the -R option, it didn't seem to work
2006-06-08T10:31:00.000Z	orbin	cdubya	what's the cp command you're using?
2006-06-08T10:32:00.000Z	cdubya	orbin	cp -R /home/user/dirs_we_want/ /media/SEA_DISK
2006-06-08T10:32:00.000Z	cdubya	orbin	that was how the man page read I thought.....
