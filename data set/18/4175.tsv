2009-07-04T06:09:00.000Z	linuxguy2009		Yeah i figured. I got so tired of doing that before. Every darn time.
2009-07-04T06:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	linuxguy2009	 that can be an issue with moving linux filesystems about. :) user id's can change and goof up ownership.
2009-08-01T05:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	linuxguy2009	 set the  modes to 777 on the stuff..  then anyone can access them all..  but thats not a good fix.. your groups method may be a better way.
2009-08-01T05:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	linuxguy2009	 ive learned to set the uid's on all my users on the various linux box's i use identically. so  my file ownership/s dont change when i move my flash drives from one to another.
2009-08-01T05:42:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	Dr_Willis	Ok cool. BTW what are the numbers I keep seeing mean for permissions? that 777 666 etc. Are they group or user numbers?
2009-08-01T05:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	linuxguy2009	 those are file permisions.. neither one. :) chown for owner.. chmod for modes.
2009-08-01T05:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	linuxguy2009	 theres guides  and docs and examples of what all those mean.
2009-08-01T05:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	linuxguy2009	 really somthing worth reading up on. I rarely use the groups feature.
2009-08-01T05:44:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	Dr_Willis	 Right on brotha! Thank you that gives me somethimg new to google and learn. Later!
2009-08-01T05:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	linuxguy2009	 i saw a little google desktop gadget that lets you click on a thing and it shows the ### permisions :)
2009-09-19T12:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	linuxguy2009	 ive seen some  netbook tweak threads on the forums that mention similer things i recall
2009-10-11T11:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	linuxguy2009	 been reading comic books? :)
2009-10-11T11:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	linuxguy2009	 ive not seen a way to do that.. (yet) but  the wife took my netbook soi havent checked into   it in the last month.
2009-10-11T11:22:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	Dr_Willis	haha no comic books
2009-11-08T12:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	linuxguy2009	 you may want to test out moovida (i think i spelt it right) its sort of like that
2009-11-08T12:19:00.000Z	linuxguy2009	Dr_Willis	Cool thanks Ill check that out.
2009-11-08T12:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	linuxguy2009	 Miro can also do that. but im not sure its in the repos.
2009-11-29T02:26:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	linuxguy2009	 no. :)
