2010-04-30T00:45:00.000Z	ratcheer	^paradox^	What version of Java are you using, now?
2010-04-30T00:46:00.000Z	^paradox^	ratcheer	ill take a look
2010-04-30T00:48:00.000Z	^paradox^	ratcheer	im not sure how to find out. the windows for sun java 6 and openjdk 6 dont have about in the drop down menus
2010-04-30T00:48:00.000Z	ratcheer	^paradox^	Use java -version
2010-04-30T00:49:00.000Z	^paradox^	ratcheer	ok ill get it brb
2010-04-30T00:50:00.000Z	^paradox^	ratcheer	heres the output. java version "1.6.0_17"
2010-04-30T00:51:00.000Z	ratcheer	^paradox^	That is way out of date. You need to upgrade to update 20
2010-04-30T00:52:00.000Z	^paradox^	ratcheer	ok so how to do so?
2010-04-30T00:53:00.000Z	ratcheer	^paradox^	First you need to add the Partner repository (if you are in Lucid).
2010-04-30T00:53:00.000Z	^paradox^	ratcheer	im not in lucid yet
2010-04-30T00:54:00.000Z	^paradox^	ratcheer	im trying to figure out what things need to be sorted out before the upgrade
2010-04-30T00:54:00.000Z	ratcheer	^paradox^	Oh. It won't matter yet, then. Upgrade Jave after you upgrade to Lucid.
2010-04-30T00:55:00.000Z	^paradox^	ratcheer	can do, but is java just going to refuse to work or anything (because of upgrading to 10.04 i mean)?
2010-04-30T00:57:00.000Z	ratcheer	^paradox^	I don't really know. As long as you upgrade Java, soon, it shouldn't make muck difference. Maybe the Lucid upgrade will even do it for you (but, I doubt it).
2010-04-30T00:58:00.000Z	^paradox^	ratcheer	but how? i gotta add a ppa or its done from the command line or synaptic?
2010-04-30T00:59:00.000Z	ratcheer	^paradox^	You just add the Partner repository.
2010-04-30T01:00:00.000Z	ratcheer	^paradox^	Do you want Open Java or the Sun Java that you have been using?
2010-04-30T01:01:00.000Z	^paradox^	ratcheer	well i dont know for sure. what i want might not be what works
