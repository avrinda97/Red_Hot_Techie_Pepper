2010-03-28T02:56:00.000Z	randomusr		what's a decent html editor that can be done with gui vs directly with the code?
2010-03-28T02:56:00.000Z	randomusr		hahah
2010-03-28T02:56:00.000Z	randomusr		funny
2010-03-28T02:57:00.000Z	Typos_King	randomusr	   I use/prefer quanta plus -> http://www.psychogenic.com/resources/images/quanta-plus.jpg
2010-04-01T03:44:00.000Z	Typos_King	randomusr	 what?
2010-04-01T03:45:00.000Z	randomusr	Typos_King	I want a partition for my files incase I have to re-install. I was going to just merge the free space but decided not to
2010-04-01T03:47:00.000Z	Typos_King	randomusr	   that's the preferred setup, yes, usuallly from the getgo, you make a small partition for your system and apps, and others for your docs and media... and I'd just grab the free space, make a partition off it and dump my files there
2010-04-01T03:48:00.000Z	randomusr	Typos_King	could I do the same for newly installed programs?
2010-04-01T03:49:00.000Z	Typos_King	randomusr	   to tell the app to install to that partition?   if the app gives you such choice, or is standalone, yes
2010-04-01T03:50:00.000Z	randomusr	Typos_King	it's dependent on the application?
2010-04-01T03:50:00.000Z	Typos_King	randomusr	   yes
2010-04-01T03:50:00.000Z	randomusr	Typos_King	I'm afraid with the number of updates and new programs that I'll run out of space on 17 gb easily
2010-04-01T03:51:00.000Z	Typos_King	randomusr	   ie, Firefox the one you download from mozilla.org comes in a bz2 package, and is standalone, you can pretty much dump it anywhere and will run from there, no installation needed
2010-04-01T03:53:00.000Z	Typos_King	randomusr	   not all compiled packages will run standalone, I mean,the ones you do a 'make install' on them, they usually move stuff over system folders
2010-04-01T03:54:00.000Z	randomusr	Typos_King	so the ones that just compile without doing make-install are standalone
2010-04-01T03:54:00.000Z	Typos_King	randomusr	   those..... I'd think they may yes
2010-04-01T03:56:00.000Z	randomusr	Typos_King	 my only issue with compiling source packages is finding the proper deps, that seems to be a headache often
2010-04-01T03:56:00.000Z	Typos_King	randomusr	   well, it comes with the territory :)
