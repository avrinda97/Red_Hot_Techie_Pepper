2005-12-06T12:34:00.000Z	subbie		the problem with redhat is that they just dont really have an up to date repository for users to install packages from
2005-12-06T12:34:00.000Z	subbie		thats why gentoo and debian based distros are so great.
2005-12-06T12:35:00.000Z	subbie		nice big repository that settles dependencies for you :)
2005-12-06T12:35:00.000Z	subbie		i prefer ubuntu =X
2005-12-06T12:36:00.000Z	subbie		i actually prefer gentoo but i got tired of all the waiting, teehee
2005-12-06T12:36:00.000Z	subbie		plus i had a HELL of a time getting the chipset that came with this shuttle computer working. ubunut did it all for me "out of the box"
2005-12-06T12:37:00.000Z	subbie		i absolutley love having gentoo on my desktop that i use all the time though but for my MythTV and my laptop, its ubuntu :)
2005-12-06T12:39:00.000Z	subbie		ok well its past my bedtime, goodnight folks and goodluck with what ails you :)
2005-12-06T12:06:00.000Z	subbie		guys i have something real weird going on.  if i do /etc/init.d/apache2 start, it just jumps back to the command prompt with no response but /usr/sbin/apache2 will start up apache2.  any ideas whats going on here?
2005-12-06T12:08:00.000Z	NoUse	subbie	dpkg -S /etc/init.d/apache2 will tell you what package owns that file
2005-12-06T12:11:00.000Z	NoUse	subbie	I would 'sudo apt-get remove --purge apache2' and then reinstall, that might fix it
2005-12-06T12:11:00.000Z	subbie	NoUse	that will blast my config files as well correct?
2005-12-06T12:12:00.000Z	NoUse	subbie	yeah
2005-12-06T12:19:00.000Z	subbie	NoUse	thanks very much, i got apache2 working now by doing that.  How would i got about making sure it runs at boottime?
2005-12-06T12:20:00.000Z	NoUse	subbie	I think that gets set automatically, basically just make sure it is symlinked in /etc/rc2.d
2005-12-06T12:22:00.000Z	subbie	NoUse	thanks again
2005-12-06T12:22:00.000Z	NoUse	subbie	sure
