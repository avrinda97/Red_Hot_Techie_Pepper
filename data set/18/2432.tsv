2012-09-30T17:47:00.000Z	dfadeur_		i'm here
2012-09-30T17:48:00.000Z	TJ-	dfadeur_	OK, lets check which driver is handling the Fresco device. Pastebin the output please... "sudo lspci -vvvnn -s 04:00.0"
2012-09-30T17:53:00.000Z	TJ-	dfadeur_	Good news. the USB3 device is being handled by the xhci_hcd driver
2012-09-30T17:55:00.000Z	TJ-	dfadeur_	It is possible that some ports on the PC are not connected to the USB3 controller. Do you know if the port you're using has been handled by the USB3 controller (for example, using Windows) ?
2012-09-30T17:57:00.000Z	TJ-	dfadeur_	OK... that's alos good! It means we're not chasing an impossible function :) ... Can you pastebin for me the log-file? You can use "tail -n 1000 /var/log/kern.log | pastebinit"  to let me see the last 1000 lines from the log-file.
2012-09-30T18:00:00.000Z	TJ-	dfadeur_	I think you missed the option "-n 1000" from 'tail'. There's only 4 lines of output
2012-09-30T18:03:00.000Z	TJ-	dfadeur_	really? did logrotate just changeover then? In that case, can you do ""tail -n 1000 /var/log/kern.log.1 | pastebinit"
2012-09-30T18:04:00.000Z	TJ-	dfadeur_	ooooo that's better...dataaaaaa! :)
2012-09-30T18:09:00.000Z	TJ-	dfadeur_	I'm still reading, don't panic!
2012-09-30T18:12:00.000Z	TJ-	dfadeur_	I see important info that indicates that laptop *may* have some ports assigned to a USB2 controller, and other ports for the USB3 controller. See http://paste.ubuntu.com/1251815/
2012-09-30T18:16:00.000Z	TJ-	dfadeur_	OK, the last part of the log-file puzzle I need, is to see the contents of "/var/log/kern.log" after you've plugged in the USB3 device to the USB3 port. If the device is currently connected, disconnect it. Then reconnect it. The do "pastebinit /var/log/kern.log"
2012-09-30T18:20:00.000Z	TJ-	dfadeur_	OK, so that is using "usb 2-1.1" and EHCI. Let me cross-reference that back to your earlier dmesg
2012-09-30T18:26:00.000Z	TJ-	dfadeur_	I'm currently researching any issues with EHCI/XHCI switching
2012-09-30T18:29:00.000Z	TJ-	dfadeur_	This may not apply to your laptop, but I'm finding references for some motherboards that indicate that the motherboard BIOS can configure the USB ports for USB2 or USB3. Do you know if the BIOS on that laptop has that functionality? If it does, it is worth checking if changing the setting will help.
2012-09-30T18:30:00.000Z	TJ-	dfadeur_	OK
