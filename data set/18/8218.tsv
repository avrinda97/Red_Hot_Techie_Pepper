2010-06-30T19:01:00.000Z	daniel		Hey guys I have problem I using two program which need to use my localadress and that doesnt work I using Sonata(MPD) also LAMPP please help me out.
2010-06-30T19:01:00.000Z	rubbs	daniel	are they both using the same port?
2010-06-30T19:02:00.000Z	rubbs	daniel	I'm not sure what the default is for MPD but Apache is usually configured for port 80
2010-06-30T19:02:00.000Z	rubbs	daniel	that can be changed in the apache config.
2010-06-30T19:03:00.000Z	rubbs	daniel	how are you trying to address it?
2010-06-30T19:06:00.000Z	rubbs	daniel	just so I understand right. what exactly is wrong about it? is either program working?
2010-06-30T19:07:00.000Z	daniel	rubbs	the thing is mpd listening on the localhost I think its making a database directory for my music (and also autosyncing)
2010-06-30T19:08:00.000Z	rubbs	daniel	both should work just fine. especially if they both have unused ports
2010-06-30T19:09:00.000Z	rubbs	daniel	you should be able to put "localhost" in the address of ff and see the LAMPP stuff, and use localhost in any MPD player and it should find it just fine.
2010-06-30T19:10:00.000Z	rubbs	daniel	well you can see if your firewall is turned on by doing : sudo ufw status. If its disabled your ports to that computer are open (the ones that are configured anyway)
2010-06-30T19:11:00.000Z	rubbs	daniel	if you mean to get out from behind your router you will have to consult the router manual for that.
2010-06-30T19:11:00.000Z	rubbs	daniel	np.
2010-06-30T19:13:00.000Z	daniel	rubbs	pici i used zenmap to scan for my ports but could just fin 80 and also 3306 hmm why arent my 6600 in?
2010-06-30T19:14:00.000Z	rubbs	daniel	is it possible that MPD is not running?
2010-06-30T19:14:00.000Z	daniel	rubbs	I can check hmm
2010-06-30T19:15:00.000Z	rubbs	daniel	if MPD isn't running then the port won't open. Linux doesn't keep a port open unless it's being used ;)
