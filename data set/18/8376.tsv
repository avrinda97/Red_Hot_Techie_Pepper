2007-08-28T06:36:00.000Z	Dumptruck		but when I try to create a virtual machine it says I do not have permissions
2007-08-28T06:36:00.000Z	Dumptruck		do I need to run vm ware with the gksudo command?
2007-08-28T06:37:00.000Z	Dumptruck		yes
2007-08-28T06:37:00.000Z	Dumptruck		and seperate drive
2007-08-28T06:37:00.000Z	Dumptruck		thanks ben
2007-08-28T06:37:00.000Z	Dumptruck		I appreciate your help
2007-08-28T06:38:00.000Z	Dumptruck		what is chown?
2007-08-28T06:38:00.000Z	Dumptruck		is it similar to chmod?
2007-08-28T06:39:00.000Z	Dumptruck		wouldn't it be better to just give everyone access?
2007-08-28T06:39:00.000Z	Dumptruck		users not other of course
2007-08-28T06:39:00.000Z	danielig	Dumptruck	you can use it with owner and group: chown -r user:group file
2007-08-28T06:59:00.000Z	danielig	Dumptruck	are you trying to write to an ntfs disk?
2007-08-28T07:03:00.000Z	Dumptruck	danielig	you want me to paste the entire list?
2007-08-28T07:03:00.000Z	danielig	Dumptruck	just one line with the disk
2007-08-28T07:05:00.000Z	danielig	Dumptruck	for example drwxr-xr-x 35 danielig danielig  4096 2007-08-28 15:51 yourdisk
2007-08-28T07:08:00.000Z	Dumptruck	danielig	yeah I've looked through three time now and I don't see it
2007-08-28T07:10:00.000Z	danielig	Dumptruck	you still have not pasted your permissions  from ls -al... first check where your disk is mounted (e.g. /mnt/hda6) then cd /mnt and do ls -al
2007-08-28T07:11:00.000Z	danielig	Dumptruck	we are all idiots, just many of us fail to realise
