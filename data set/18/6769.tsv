2010-11-24T05:12:00.000Z	bonhoffer	Jordan_U	i know
2010-11-24T05:14:00.000Z	Jordan_U	bonhoffer	Could you pastebin your /etc/apt/sources.list and the output of "sudo apt-get update"?
2010-11-24T05:14:00.000Z	bonhoffer	Jordan_U	sure
2010-11-24T05:17:00.000Z	bonhoffer	Jordan_U	http://www.pastie.org/1321590
2010-11-24T05:18:00.000Z	Jordan_U	bonhoffer	Could you also pastebin the contents of /var/lib/update-manager/meta-release ?
2010-11-24T05:22:00.000Z	Jordan_U	bonhoffer	That has sources.lst has repositories for "gutsy", but you said you're upgrading from 7.04, "feisty".
2010-11-24T05:23:00.000Z	bonhoffer	Jordan_U	i thought i needed to do that to upgrade to gutsy
2010-11-24T05:26:00.000Z	Jordan_U	bonhoffer	That's only for "Some users have reported that they still have to download packages from archives.ubuntu.com while everything resides on old-releases". And I don't understand the reasoning even then.
2010-11-24T05:26:00.000Z	Jordan_U	bonhoffer	Change your sources.lst back and try the upgrade again.
2010-11-24T05:26:00.000Z	bonhoffer	Jordan_U	thanks -- i'll look into it
2010-11-24T05:26:00.000Z	Jordan_U	bonhoffer	You're welcome.
2010-11-24T06:25:00.000Z	Jordan_U	bonhoffer	Do *not* upgrade to 8.10. You can, and should, go directory from one LTS release (8.04) to another (10.04).
2010-11-24T06:26:00.000Z	bonhoffer	Jordan_U	i don't see how i can do that
2010-11-24T06:26:00.000Z	bonhoffer	Jordan_U	i have 8.04 now
2010-11-24T06:27:00.000Z	bonhoffer	Jordan_U	i am running do-release-upgrade, we will see where this goes
