2005-03-03T16:31:00.000Z	maximaus		sudo modprobe sb
2005-03-03T16:31:00.000Z	maximaus		sudo dmesg
2005-03-03T16:31:00.000Z	maximaus		sudo echo sb >> /etc/modules
2005-03-03T16:31:00.000Z	maximaus		that's what worked yesterday for the ISA card but now I don't have permissions as root even to access /etc/modules. :/
2005-03-03T16:32:00.000Z	maximaus		yup, wierd
2005-03-03T16:32:00.000Z	maximaus		crap, I knew the working ISA card was too good to last a reboot.
2005-03-03T16:34:00.000Z	maximaus		even Playskool Gaim IRC has tab-completion... LOL
2005-03-03T16:34:00.000Z	maximaus		Well that's just a bit darn fancy... :P
2005-03-03T16:36:00.000Z	maximaus		so "modprobe sb" finds my ISA sound card right...
2005-03-03T16:36:00.000Z	maximaus		how do I get it to do this automatically upon boot?
2005-03-03T16:36:00.000Z	Panzerboy	maximaus	you have to add that sb thingy to some file
2005-03-03T16:37:00.000Z	Panzerboy	maximaus	remember, in linux, everything is easy :)
2005-03-03T16:39:00.000Z	Panzerboy	maximaus	dunno, try it
