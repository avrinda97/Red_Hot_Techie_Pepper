2011-02-09T17:29:00.000Z	cba123		I have an iPad with a VNC app.  It can connect via an SSH tunnel, however when I try to connect to with VNC over SSH, it says "connection refused" do I have to "enable" tunneling on my Ubuntu?
2011-02-09T17:30:00.000Z	razz11	cba123	can you post the command you use to connect
2011-02-09T17:31:00.000Z	razz11	cba123	what vnc server are you trying to connect to?
2011-02-09T17:32:00.000Z	cba123	razz11	that's partly the issue.  It's an app, it does the command without showing me.  I can SSH in through, with an SSH app.  I installed x11vnc after googling around a bit.
2011-02-09T17:34:00.000Z	cba123	razz11	Actually, I think I might have part of the problem.  It has an option for VNC IP and SSH IP.  If I'm tunneling, wouldn't my VNC IP be 127.0.0.1, or at least my local ip?  (forgot to put your name at the front)
2011-02-09T17:34:00.000Z	razz11	cba123	so did you set up the x11vncrc file, yes it has to be 127.0.0.1
2011-02-09T17:34:00.000Z	cba123	razz11	No, thought it setup partly itself.  I'll look up how to do that.
2011-02-09T17:37:00.000Z	razz11	cba123	what I do is i ssh first and run x11vnc then if successful it will show that it is listening on port 5900, my suggestion is to try vinagre first, its easy to setup. and always use pub key encryption for ssh, if you just use password, check your logs to see how many attempts are made on port 22, hope its not 22, but its not a good idea
2011-02-09T17:40:00.000Z	cba123	razz11	isn't vinagre a viewer?  I need something to connect to.  I did x11vnc, and ran it.  I can see my screen on my iPad now, but I can't modify anything.  And if I disconnect and reconnect, I have to manually restart x11vnc.
2011-02-09T17:46:00.000Z	cba123	razz11	Sorry, power blinked.  But yes, I can get a connection via x11vnc, but can't interact.  I also can't connect more than once without restarting x11vnc.
2011-02-09T17:46:00.000Z	razz11	cba123	you can also just use the command line switches with the x11vnc, and vino is the server, pretty crap but easy to setup. see http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1547773&highlight=987a654, x11vnc maintainer helped me
2011-02-09T17:47:00.000Z	razz11	cba123	do you use pub keys
2011-02-09T17:48:00.000Z	razz11	cba123	if not go with hamachi, way easy, but if you need top security, i guess ssh with pub-private key setup
2011-02-09T18:02:00.000Z	cba123	razz11	I don't really know what a pub key is, apart from the obvious english meaning.  I'd prefer a bit more security, if it doesn't take hours and hours of setup.
2011-02-09T18:05:00.000Z	razz11	cba123	try this command and you will see if any one tried to get in to your system : grep -ir "Failed password" /var/log/* or grep -ir WARNING /var/log/*
2011-02-09T18:06:00.000Z	razz11	cba123	I highly recommend you use hamachi, its less work and will be excellent for your needs without opening up any unnecessary security holes
2011-02-09T18:08:00.000Z	cba123	razz11	I would, but the client is an iPad.  Meaning no hamachi.  I have hamachi for my laptop to connect though.  I'll be back in a few hours, have to go to class.
2011-02-09T18:10:00.000Z	razz11	cba123	not sure about ipad, see if they have a experimental version. their beta versions are pretty stable.
