2012-05-05T17:37:00.000Z	coldlogic		i have questions about xbmc. anybody can help me or point me to the correct channel pls?
2012-05-05T17:38:00.000Z	stefg	coldlogic	i just managed to get xbmc-pvr running on my 12.04 machine+
2012-05-05T17:39:00.000Z	coldlogic	stefg	i got it running. but i see on some sites a way to integrate hulu, but cannot find it in the program add-ons. any ideas?
2012-05-05T17:40:00.000Z	stefg	coldlogic	there are myriads of slightly different builds available for ubuntu .... hulu support should be an addon, have you tried to install it?
2012-05-05T17:41:00.000Z	coldlogic	stefg	on one machine i have ubuntu 12.04 and i added it through the software center, on another i have windows 7 and installed it on that as well, and i have a live-disc for xbmcbuntu on a machine with no HD, but cannot find hulu anywhere
2012-05-05T17:43:00.000Z	stefg	coldlogic	the plugin might not be available for all the different versions/builds. I used the yavdr ppa to get my xbmc, but hulu is out of question for me (no hulu in germany)
2012-05-05T17:44:00.000Z	stefg	coldlogic	but i could look if something is offered for my version in the addon manager
2012-05-05T17:46:00.000Z	stefg	coldlogic	no dice ... i have no hulu addon offerde in xbmc's addon manager . here's why: http://lifehacker.com/5773868/add-hulu-and-hulu-plus-to-xbmc-with-this-add+on
2012-05-05T17:47:00.000Z	coldlogic	stefg	thank you.
