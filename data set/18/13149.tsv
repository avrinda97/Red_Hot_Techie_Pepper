2007-12-27T22:25:00.000Z	graft	zobban	lsof /dev/dsp
2007-12-27T22:27:00.000Z	graft	zobban	why is vlc using oss instead of ALSA directly?
2007-12-27T22:28:00.000Z	graft	zobban	type 'lsof /dev/dsp' in your shell and pastebin the output
2007-12-27T22:29:00.000Z	graft	zobban	are you running esd?
2007-12-27T22:29:00.000Z	graft	zobban	ps -ef | grep esd
2007-12-27T22:30:00.000Z	graft	zobban	okay... do you have aoss installed? just try running 'which aoss'
2007-12-27T22:30:00.000Z	graft	zobban	if you do, you can 'wrap' vlc in aoss by running 'aoss vlc <your options>' and it might work okay
2007-12-27T22:31:00.000Z	graft	zobban	that's fine, just sudo apt-get install alsa-oss
2007-12-27T22:31:00.000Z	graft	zobban	alternatively you can configure vlc to talk with esd, probably
2007-12-27T22:33:00.000Z	graft	zobban	how are you opening vlc?
2007-12-27T22:36:00.000Z	graft	zobban	you appear to have other issues..
2007-12-27T22:36:00.000Z	graft	zobban	pastebin the output of ls -al /home/zobban/.kde
2007-12-27T22:37:00.000Z	graft	zobban	rebooting might fix it but it's better to figure out what's wrong, i think, so it doesn't happen again. plus if you have some nasty permissions issue you might not be able to login again
2007-12-27T22:38:00.000Z	graft	zobban	yes, but you're not running as root, so permissions are still an issue
