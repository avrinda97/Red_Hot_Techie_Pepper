2009-01-13T18:26:00.000Z	xanxor		So nobody can help me with my microphone settings problem, then.
2009-01-13T18:28:00.000Z	xanxor		Decard_BR26354: I've already been on the forums and didn't find a solution. That's why I came here. I can't give up because I don't have a phone and need my microphone to use VoIP.
2009-01-13T18:28:00.000Z	xanxor		If nobody is going to help me that's fine, I just won't waste more time sitting here asking. You guys are usually very helpful and I appreciate that, so if you can't help so be it.
2009-01-13T18:28:00.000Z	sarmisak	xanxor	is this a notebook?
2009-01-13T18:28:00.000Z	xanxor	sarmisak	Yes, it's Packard Bell laptop.
2009-01-13T18:29:00.000Z	sarmisak	xanxor	usually on laptops there are two different mics -in my samsung it is- pop up the mixer window, and go to settings
2009-01-13T18:29:00.000Z	sarmisak	xanxor	you should see two mics, one is just mic, and the other one is front mic.
2009-01-13T18:30:00.000Z	sarmisak	xanxor	just switch them on and off until you hear some sound from it, that's the way I solved it.
2009-01-13T18:30:00.000Z	xanxor	sarmisak	I don't see anything that says front mic. In the default mixer window I just see Microphone, which is enabled and at full volume. Then when I go into Recording, there's a thing that says Microphone and it's disabled.
2009-01-13T18:30:00.000Z	xanxor	sarmisak	Whenever I enable it, it re-disables itself. The setting won't stick.
2009-01-13T18:30:00.000Z	sarmisak	xanxor	hmm that's pretty strange
2009-01-13T18:31:00.000Z	sarmisak	xanxor	maybe you should switch off any voip software before trying to record
2009-01-13T18:31:00.000Z	sarmisak	xanxor	sometimes you can access sound hardware at one program only
2009-01-13T18:32:00.000Z	xanxor	sarmisak	I don't know what you mean by that.
2009-01-13T18:33:00.000Z	sarmisak	xanxor	ok, when you access your sound hardware by using ALSA only one program can access the hardware
2009-01-13T18:33:00.000Z	sarmisak	xanxor	just shut everything else that might use sound, and then try recording
2009-01-13T18:33:00.000Z	xanxor	sarmisak	okay, thanks. I'll try that.
2009-01-13T18:34:00.000Z	xanxor	sarmisak	I assume that includes web browsers and evrything that might use sound, so I'll be back in a minute.
