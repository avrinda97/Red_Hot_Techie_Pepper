2008-09-28T06:08:00.000Z	RipperJ		i installed 7zip but i dont see it nowhere in applications sections nor if i type in 7zip in terminal do i get anything any ideas?
2008-09-28T06:08:00.000Z	dr_willis	RipperJ	 use the package manager tools to see what files it installed.. I forget its command line  comand names also. :)
2008-09-28T06:09:00.000Z	RipperJ	dr_willis	u mean synaptic package manger??
2008-09-28T06:09:00.000Z	dr_willis	RipperJ	 thats one tool that can do it.. or the command line tools can.. or  if you are using kde, adept can do it..
2008-09-28T06:10:00.000Z	RipperJ	dr_willis	im using gnome ima see brb
2008-09-28T06:17:00.000Z	RipperJ	dr_willis	i have p7zip-full in synaptic package manager working
2008-09-28T06:18:00.000Z	dr_willis	RipperJ	 fire up synaptic, search for the package, check its properties. it should show what files it isntalled..  the commands would be the ones installed to the bin dirs.
2008-09-28T06:21:00.000Z	RipperJ	dr_willis	okay i see the command is 7za and i guess 7z because i see usr/bin7z and usr/bin/7za im a noobie i typed it in in terminal
2008-09-28T06:22:00.000Z	RipperJ	dr_willis	and it worked fine.  but wow is there a gui?
2008-09-28T06:22:00.000Z	dr_willis	RipperJ	 there are archive tools/frontends that use  the 7zip stuff if found I belive.. I never use them
2008-09-28T06:22:00.000Z	RipperJ	dr_willis	i could get use to the commandline but i would love to just have a gui for easy and faster access and work
2008-09-28T06:23:00.000Z	dr_willis	RipperJ	  i tend to use 'unp' to unpack archives.. and thats about it. i arely make them
2008-09-28T06:23:00.000Z	RipperJ	dr_willis	okay thank you i learned something new today htough thanks
2008-09-28T06:23:00.000Z	RipperJ	dr_willis	would u say unp is one of the best archiving files ou there? im just trying to use a program that compresses the best
2008-09-28T06:24:00.000Z	dr_willis	RipperJ	 its an UNARCHIVING tool. :) its   unp whateverarchive  (and it normally figures out the right command to unpack the archive)
2008-09-28T06:24:00.000Z	RipperJ	dr_willis	okay cool thank u thats good to know too
2008-09-28T06:25:00.000Z	RipperJ	dr_willis	thanks i appreciate the help you gave me today
2008-09-28T06:27:00.000Z	RipperJ	dr_willis	hey im so stupid i didnt see that when you right click the file u want compressed that the archive manager has an extension for .7z but tahnks either way i didnt realize it
