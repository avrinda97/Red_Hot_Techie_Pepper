2010-05-22T06:15:00.000Z	Zeike	Guest86115	the intel drivers are included
2010-05-22T06:15:00.000Z	Zeike	Guest86115	in a standard install
2010-05-22T06:16:00.000Z	Guest86115	Zeike	its not detecting them becuase it wont detect my monitor so I cant change the resolution
2010-05-22T06:19:00.000Z	Zeike	Guest86115	but if you want to be sure, check and see if the package "xserver-xorg-video-intel" package is installed
2010-05-22T06:22:00.000Z	Guest86115	Zeike	couldnt find anypackages under sudo aptitude install xserver-xorg-video-intel
2010-05-22T06:22:00.000Z	Zeike	Guest86115	what does 'apt-cache search xorg intel' show you?
2010-05-22T06:25:00.000Z	Guest86115	Zeike	a bunch of drivers
2010-05-22T06:27:00.000Z	Zeike	Guest86115	Which packages do you see available?  If its a lot, post them in pastebin.ubuntu.com or something
2010-05-22T06:31:00.000Z	Guest86115	Zeike	http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/437593/
2010-05-22T06:33:00.000Z	Zeike	Guest86115	the 2nd one on the list, xserver-xorg-video-intel is what you want to make sure is installed
2010-05-22T06:34:00.000Z	Guest86115	Zeike	ok how
2010-05-22T06:35:00.000Z	Zeike	Guest86115	"sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-intel"
2010-05-22T06:36:00.000Z	Guest86115	Zeike	says 0 installed 0 upgraded 0 to remove
2010-05-22T06:38:00.000Z	Zeike	Guest86115	do you know what intel chipset you have?  "lspci" might be able to tell you this
2010-05-22T06:40:00.000Z	Guest86115	Zeike	that doesnt show it, but sticker says atom
2010-05-22T06:42:00.000Z	Zeike	Guest86115	I'm not sure if this will work, but you can try.  do "sudo gedit /etc/modules" and add "i915" on an empty line at the end of that file.  You'll have to restart after that
2010-05-22T06:44:00.000Z	Guest86115	Zeike	ill try that the file was empty but lp in it
