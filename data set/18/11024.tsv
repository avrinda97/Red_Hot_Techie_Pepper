2006-09-29T16:18:00.000Z	new2linx	ladydoor	can you tell how?
2006-09-29T16:19:00.000Z	ladydoor	new2linx	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=237408 . replace the "mute sound" stuff with your button.
2006-09-29T16:20:00.000Z	new2linx	ladydoor	i'll check it out. is it going to self explanatory?
2006-09-29T16:20:00.000Z	ladydoor	new2linx	i tried to make it that way...it starts a couple posts down, by LadyDoor
2006-09-29T16:22:00.000Z	new2linx	ladydoor	next thing, i can't get an iso image mounted? i am using sudo mount -o loop -t iso9660 FC3-i386-disc1.iso /mnt/iso
2006-09-29T16:22:00.000Z	ladydoor	new2linx	does /mnt/iso exist?
2006-09-29T16:22:00.000Z	ladydoor	new2linx	does it work or doesn't it?
2006-09-29T16:23:00.000Z	ladydoor	new2linx	if something doesn't work, you don't have to *ask* us whether it works or not--a question mark means it's a question.
2006-09-29T16:23:00.000Z	new2linx	ladydoor	yes, this is what it says. mount: Not a directory
2006-09-29T16:23:00.000Z	ladydoor	new2linx	right, so does the dir exist?
2006-09-29T16:24:00.000Z	ladydoor	new2linx	(ls /mnt...if it doesn't spit anything out, it doesn't exist)
2006-09-29T16:24:00.000Z	new2linx	ladydoor	i meant to write a !
2006-09-29T16:24:00.000Z	ladydoor	new2linx	fair enough
2006-09-29T16:25:00.000Z	ladydoor	new2linx	ok, i've got to run. please check to see if the dir exists, and if not, create it with mkdir
2006-09-29T16:25:00.000Z	new2linx	ladydoor	the dir exists
