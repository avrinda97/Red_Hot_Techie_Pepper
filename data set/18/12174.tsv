2006-06-23T14:50:00.000Z	Hawkwind		Anyone have any ideas on my issue so I can please finish the Ubuntu install ?????
2006-06-23T14:51:00.000Z	Hawkwind		I'm in the middle of an install of Dapper and I get to the point where it's trying to install the desktop packages.  In the alt-f4 screen it's saying it can't resolve us.archive.ubuntu.com and many other sites but nothing more is happening.  How can I get past this so I can finish the install using this alternate CD ?
2006-06-23T14:52:00.000Z	Tonren	Hawkwind	Are you installing using a Live CD?
2006-06-23T14:52:00.000Z	Hawkwind	Tonren	No, the alternate CD
2006-06-23T14:53:00.000Z	Hawkwind	Tonren	Why it's trying to access the net I have no idea
2006-06-23T14:53:00.000Z	Tonren	Hawkwind	Is there a particular reason you're not using the Live CD?  It makes things much easier.
2006-06-23T14:53:00.000Z	Hawkwind	Tonren	Because I downloaded the alternate CD.  I have no other box to download it too and burn it now
2006-06-23T14:54:00.000Z	Tonren	Hawkwind	What about the one you're on?  Have you already formatted that box's previous OS?
2006-06-23T14:54:00.000Z	Hawkwind	Tonren	This box doesn't have a burner
2006-06-23T14:55:00.000Z	Hawkwind	Tonren	I did the install and had issues getting into KDE due to old configs from Mandriva in my ~/  So I redid the install and formatted /home and now I've been at this same point 3 times
2006-06-23T14:55:00.000Z	Tonren	Hawkwind	Oh, are you doing kubuntu?
2006-06-23T14:56:00.000Z	Hawkwind	Tonren	Nevermind, it seemed to just start doing something :)
2006-06-23T14:56:00.000Z	Tonren	Hawkwind	Aah, okay.  Good luck.  Hehehe.  Come back if you need more help; maybe I'll actually be able to help you then.
2006-06-23T14:57:00.000Z	Hawkwind	Tonren	Heh thanks.  Seems the system is rebooting now in fact :)
2006-06-23T14:57:00.000Z	Tonren	Hawkwind	Great.  Look at it this way: This is the equivalent of waiting on hold at Microsoft for them to authorize your XP installation.
2006-06-23T14:57:00.000Z	Hawkwind	Tonren	LOL so true
2006-06-23T14:57:00.000Z	Hawkwind	Tonren	And we all know we've all done that a time or 15
2006-06-23T14:58:00.000Z	Tonren	Hawkwind	Abso-freakin'-lutely.
