2006-06-24T12:33:00.000Z	eth42		I want to install dapper using the graphical installer. however, ubuntu is started with 640x480 screen resolution, and the installer simply doesn't fit on the screen (I cannot press any OK/Next button since I don't see it). What can I do?
2006-06-24T12:34:00.000Z	sethk	eth42	what wastrel said; also, try control-alt-+ to cycle through other available resolutions
2006-06-24T12:34:00.000Z	eth42	sethk	higher screen resolutions are not configured
2006-06-24T12:35:00.000Z	eth42	sethk	so ctrl-alt-+ doesnt work
2006-06-24T12:35:00.000Z	sethk	eth42	if your hardware can't do higher resolutions, then set up a virtual resolution that is higher than the real resolution
2006-06-24T12:35:00.000Z	sethk	eth42	that way you can move around.  but alt-click is better if it does what you need
2006-06-24T12:35:00.000Z	eth42	sethk	I was running every linux before on 1024x768
2006-06-24T12:36:00.000Z	sethk	eth42	ok, then it isn't a hardware issue
2006-06-24T12:36:00.000Z	sethk	eth42	I've seen that happen when the monitor is not automatically identified
2006-06-24T12:36:00.000Z	sethk	eth42	it defaults to 640x480.  You can do dpkg-reconfigure for X and tell it what resolution your monitor is capable of
2006-06-24T12:36:00.000Z	eth42	sethk	eobanb: it's an nvidia4 mx
2006-06-24T12:37:00.000Z	sethk	eth42	it isn't a card issue, it's most likely a monitor issue
2006-06-24T12:37:00.000Z	sethk	eth42	even if it knows your card can do higher res, it won't do it unless it thinks your monitor can do so also
2006-06-24T12:37:00.000Z	sethk	eth42	so do the reconfigure, then choose generic monitor 1280x960
2006-06-24T12:37:00.000Z	eth42	sethk	ok. shouldn't the installer make me aware of the fact that 640 x 480 is a bit low, and should run dpkg-reconfigure automatically?
2006-06-24T12:38:00.000Z	sethk	eth42	I don't know, I didn't write the installer  :)
2006-06-24T12:43:00.000Z	eth42	sethk	eobanb: I reconfigured xserver-xorg, gave the default answer for every question, and now it runs at 1024x768. very strange
2006-06-24T12:45:00.000Z	sethk	eth42	not entirely strange.  Most likely there are kernel modules loaded now, that were not loaded during the config during install, that let it ID the monitor, or the card, or whatever.  It recognized something it missed the first time around
