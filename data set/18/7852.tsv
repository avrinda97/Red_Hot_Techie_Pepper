2007-11-04T12:33:00.000Z	spydez		Where did my files go? They were there yesterday, but today they're showing up with permissions of "?---------" and ls is coloring them red on black. And I haven't done anything to them...
2007-11-04T12:33:00.000Z	scguy318	spydez	boot to a LiveCD and run fsck
2007-11-04T12:34:00.000Z	spydez	scguy318	thanks.
2007-11-04T12:34:00.000Z	scguy318	spydez	np
2007-11-04T13:15:00.000Z	spydez	scguy318	fsck didn't fix my files...
2007-11-04T13:16:00.000Z	scguy318	spydez	weird, what filesystem?
2007-11-04T13:16:00.000Z	spydez	scguy318	ext3
2007-11-04T13:16:00.000Z	scguy318	spydez	weird, you may wish to use testdisk
2007-11-04T13:16:00.000Z	scguy318	spydez	or Rescubuntu
2007-11-04T13:18:00.000Z	spydez	scguy318	will either of those check my hard drive's health?
2007-11-04T13:18:00.000Z	scguy318	spydez	they will attempt to recover files
2007-11-04T13:19:00.000Z	spydez	scguy318	The data being gone ain't that important. I've backups... I kinda wanna know why it left. :p
2007-11-04T13:19:00.000Z	scguy318	spydez	you can check syslog and co. perhaps
2007-11-04T13:19:00.000Z	scguy318	spydez	for HDD health check, what hard drive? your hdd manfacturer should have a health checking tool
2007-11-04T13:20:00.000Z	spydez	scguy318	I don't know... Whatever dell was using when it slapped this laptop together.
2007-11-04T13:22:00.000Z	scguy318	spydez	mm, fsck is supposed to be it, but I guess you could use something like SpinRite (find a copy in P2P or w/e)
2007-11-04T13:23:00.000Z	spydez	scguy318	Apparently it's a Hitachi... I'll look for a tool from them or see if I can borrow SpinRite from a friend. Thanks for the help.
