2007-05-15T16:13:00.000Z	Blazingazn		How do i install my Nvidia drivers on ubuntu, are there any tutorials on the web?
2007-05-15T14:11:00.000Z	Blazingazn		My friend helped me set up partitions for ubuntu he made a swap an ext3 and an extended and theres an unallocated how would i set up ubuntu manual partition or resize the hda3? i'm planning to dualboot.
2007-05-15T14:12:00.000Z	Blazingazn		Me?
2007-05-15T14:12:00.000Z	dawn_chorus	Blazingazn	how big is the unpartitioned space?
2007-05-15T14:12:00.000Z	dawn_chorus	Blazingazn	no.  the "free" (unpartitioned) space.
2007-05-15T14:13:00.000Z	dawn_chorus	Blazingazn	oh i see.  you want to put ubuntu on the ext3, yes?
2007-05-15T14:13:00.000Z	dawn_chorus	Blazingazn	use manual partitioning.
2007-05-15T14:14:00.000Z	dawn_chorus	Blazingazn	i'd be happy to.  :)
2007-05-15T14:15:00.000Z	dawn_chorus	Blazingazn	yes.  just mount the ext3 partition to mount.  Set / as the mount point of the ext3 partition.
2007-05-15T14:16:00.000Z	dawn_chorus	Blazingazn	an extended is kind of like a big envelope that houses other partitions.  don't worry about setting a mount point for the extended partition, just the ext3 partition.
2007-05-15T14:16:00.000Z	dawn_chorus	Blazingazn	where'd you put that picture?
2007-05-15T14:17:00.000Z	Blazingazn	dawn_chorus	take a look http://img518.imageshack.us/my.php?image=takealookiq7.png
2007-05-15T14:18:00.000Z	dawn_chorus	Blazingazn	that scheme looks OK.  I don't understand why the Swap was placed inside of an extended, but it's no big deal.
2007-05-15T14:19:00.000Z	dawn_chorus	Blazingazn	you want to change the ext3 from sda3 to / .
2007-05-15T14:21:00.000Z	dawn_chorus	Blazingazn	there should be mount options for those too.  you can put them whereever in the file tree you like, but normally it would be /media/sda1, /media/sda2, etc.  just be sure to mount /dev/sda3 to / .  :)
2007-05-15T15:01:00.000Z	dawn_chorus	Blazingazn	what's up?
2007-05-15T15:01:00.000Z	dawn_chorus	Blazingazn	yeah?
2007-05-15T15:02:00.000Z	dawn_chorus	Blazingazn	you'll want to do some reading first.  :)
