2009-11-03T22:27:00.000Z	JMFTheVCI		is there a specific channel for discussing Ubuntu Networking issues?
2009-11-03T22:27:00.000Z	JMFTheVCI		!networking
2009-11-03T22:28:00.000Z	Dmole	JMFTheVCI	what be the problem?
2009-11-03T22:29:00.000Z	JMFTheVCI	Dmole	Still on Jaunty. Overnight I have a mysterious tun0 interface (192.168.0.1) but no VPC client installed.
2009-11-03T22:30:00.000Z	JMFTheVCI	Dmole	No NM-vpnc or OpenVPN
2009-11-03T22:30:00.000Z	Dmole	JMFTheVCI	sometimes if a connection was not closed properly that can happen
2009-11-03T22:30:00.000Z	JMFTheVCI	Dmole	How to remove it?
2009-11-03T22:32:00.000Z	Dmole	JMFTheVCI	did you try ifconfig?
2009-11-03T22:32:00.000Z	Dmole	JMFTheVCI	or that other one
2009-11-03T22:32:00.000Z	JMFTheVCI	Dmole	I can remove it with ifconfig but it returns on reboot.
2009-11-03T22:34:00.000Z	Dmole	JMFTheVCI	probably something you installed expects it and added it to /etc/network/interfaces or some place
2009-11-03T22:36:00.000Z	JMFTheVCI	Dmole	tun0 is not in /etc/network/interfaces. Just the normal iface lo intet loopback
2009-11-03T22:37:00.000Z	Dmole	JMFTheVCI	must be in /etc/init.d/ someplace, do you NEEED it gone?
2009-11-03T22:37:00.000Z	JMFTheVCI	Dmole	prefferably. Don't like to have any wasted resource if possible.
2009-11-03T22:38:00.000Z	Dmole	JMFTheVCI	/etc/init.d/networking restart?
2009-11-03T22:39:00.000Z	JMFTheVCI	Dmole	Yup, done that, still there.
2009-11-03T22:41:00.000Z	Dmole	JMFTheVCI	 look in /etc/init.d/networking
