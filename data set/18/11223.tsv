2007-01-27T10:29:00.000Z	tom47	Amit	are you running them as livecd' or installed onto hard disk?
2007-01-27T10:30:00.000Z	tom47	Amit	it will always be slow running in that mode unfortunately .... its caused by loading rpograms from the cd instead of a hard disk ..... its not an ubuntu issue as such
2007-01-27T10:31:00.000Z	tom47	Amit	yes it has o be installed properly
2007-01-27T10:32:00.000Z	tom47	Amit	what is your firs anguage?
2007-01-27T10:43:00.000Z	tom47	Amit	there is a smaller ubuntu india group at #ubuntu-in .... not that i want to push you there but just letting you know
2007-01-27T10:46:00.000Z	tom47	Amit	which version do you have installed again?
2007-01-27T10:51:00.000Z	tom47	Amit	did you see the warning to use the Alternate CD and not the livecd ????
2007-01-27T10:52:00.000Z	tom47	Amit	^^^^^
2007-01-27T10:53:00.000Z	tom47	Amit	you can but its not recommended and i take it from the comment that the results are unprdictable
2007-01-27T10:57:00.000Z	tom47	Amit	i would be inclined to get teh alternate cd and use bttorrent so that its sure to be ok
2007-01-27T10:59:00.000Z	tom47	Amit	you may not be able to get a 6.06 torrent ... just checking
