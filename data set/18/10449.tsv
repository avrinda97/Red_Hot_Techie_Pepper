2006-11-30T15:58:00.000Z	nette		hey: can someone help me? i want to make a welcome message whenever I open a new shell..anyone done this before?
2006-11-30T15:59:00.000Z	nette		i know how to do it when i log into a remote machine, just edit /etc/motd.. but how do i do that in a shell on my pc?
2006-11-30T15:59:00.000Z	zention	nette	an echo in the resoucre file can do it
2006-11-30T16:00:00.000Z	nette	zention	can u explain more?
2006-11-30T16:00:00.000Z	zention	nette	what shell do you use
2006-11-30T16:00:00.000Z	zention	nette	there are other ways to do it though
2006-11-30T16:01:00.000Z	zention	nette	ok I will assume bash
2006-11-30T16:02:00.000Z	zention	nette	vi ~/.bashrc and add an echo line to the end
2006-11-30T16:02:00.000Z	nette	zention	ok:)
2006-11-30T16:02:00.000Z	nette	zention	thanks it worked:)
2006-11-30T16:03:00.000Z	zention	nette	there is a way to system wide messages upon login
2006-11-30T16:04:00.000Z	zention	nette	you might want to look into /etc/motd
2006-11-30T16:04:00.000Z	zention	nette	motd is messageof the day
2006-11-30T16:04:00.000Z	nette	zention	hm  yeah.. i've done that on my server.. :)
2006-11-30T16:06:00.000Z	zention	nette	you have to be a little careful - as sometimes applications logon as users - so ~/.bashrc is fairly safe but /etc/bashrc probably is not to do that
2006-11-30T16:07:00.000Z	nette	zention	ok will keep that in mind
2006-11-30T16:07:00.000Z	zention	nette	there is a distinction between an interactive logon and one that is not so read up on the bash files to find out which is which
2006-11-30T16:13:00.000Z	nette	zention	now it looks cool: i have a tigger-head at shell startup:) thanks
