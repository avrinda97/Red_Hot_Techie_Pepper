2008-11-28T11:44:00.000Z	ardchoille		I forget how to do a memory test
2008-11-28T11:45:00.000Z	rww	ardchoille	reboot the computer and choose the memtest option on the boot menu
2008-11-28T20:01:00.000Z	ardchoille	rww	history -c  clear ~/.bash_history too
2008-11-28T20:02:00.000Z	rww	ardchoille	yeah, I didn't know that command ;-)
2010-01-11T17:19:00.000Z	rww	ardchoille	yes. If you want a gui, look at gufw
2010-01-11T17:19:00.000Z	ardchoille	rww	Thanks
2010-01-11T17:20:00.000Z	rww	ardchoille	ufw has existed since hardy, by the way
2010-01-11T17:20:00.000Z	ardchoille	rww	oh, didn't know that
2010-01-24T06:11:00.000Z	rww	ardchoille	seahorse-plugins
2010-01-24T06:14:00.000Z	ardchoille	rww	do I need to enable those plugins somehow? They aren't showing in the nautilus menu
2010-01-24T06:14:00.000Z	rww	ardchoille	restart GNOME, perhaps
2010-01-24T06:15:00.000Z	ardchoille	rww	That worked, thank you
2010-03-01T10:13:00.000Z	ardchoille	rww	hehe
2010-03-01T14:07:00.000Z	ardchoille	rww	correct
2010-03-07T08:04:00.000Z	rww	ardchoille	Empathy is the nearest thing it installs. It's barely useable as an IRC client, though.
2010-03-07T08:07:00.000Z	rww	ardchoille	pointing them at webchat.freenode.net is easier if they're only going to be using it occasionally
2010-03-07T08:07:00.000Z	ardchoille	rww	Nope, their switching from Windows to Ubuntu :D
2011-02-10T06:38:00.000Z	ardchoille	rww	Uh oh, hehe
