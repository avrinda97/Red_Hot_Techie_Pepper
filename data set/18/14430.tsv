2007-10-21T19:52:00.000Z	jnc	godzirra	your DNS is fubar
2007-10-21T19:52:00.000Z	godzirra	jnc	thats it?  Why can I not open a terminal window if my dns is broken? :po
2007-10-21T19:52:00.000Z	jnc	godzirra	either your hard disk is going bad, or your hostname is not immediately resolvable
2007-10-21T19:52:00.000Z	jnc	godzirra	if you run 'xterm' it won't look up your host, so you could use that in a pinch
2007-10-21T19:53:00.000Z	godzirra	jnc	I don't think the hard drive is bad.  Its a new laptop.
2007-10-21T19:54:00.000Z	godzirra	jnc	and xterm didn't run either.  (this ran fine for hours and hours on feisty)
2007-10-21T19:54:00.000Z	jnc	godzirra	another possibility is that (if you're running Xgl) the composite manager crashed
2007-10-21T19:56:00.000Z	godzirra	jnc	how do I tell if thats the case?
2007-10-21T19:56:00.000Z	jnc	godzirra	I don't know much about the Xgl stuff, my hardware is never that nice
2007-10-21T19:58:00.000Z	jnc	godzirra	that really sounds like a network problem though
2007-10-21T19:58:00.000Z	godzirra	jnc	Well, my wireless disconnected... but why would my wireless getting disconnected cause my whole system to stop working?
2007-10-21T19:58:00.000Z	jnc	godzirra	because it's *nix.
2007-10-21T19:59:00.000Z	godzirra	jnc	it never did that before on feisty, even when my network got disconnected.
2007-10-21T19:59:00.000Z	jnc	godzirra	privmsg me, we'll walk through and fix your stuffs
2007-10-22T07:43:00.000Z	jnc	godzirra	this applies to you
2007-10-22T07:43:00.000Z	godzirra	jnc	wht does?
2007-10-22T07:44:00.000Z	jnc	godzirra	see my previous post
2007-10-22T07:44:00.000Z	godzirra	jnc	about laggy gnome performance?  I don't have that problem though...
