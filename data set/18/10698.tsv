2008-03-21T16:30:00.000Z	Yancho		anyone has any idea how i can make use of a 15GB hdd space for my / filesystem please? especially for updating packages
2008-03-21T16:30:00.000Z	MenZa	Yancho	What's the problem?
2008-03-21T16:31:00.000Z	Yancho	MenZa	my / filesystem is almost filled up - and i need to upgrade ubuntu since xserver-xorg needs a more updated ubuntu. i have 6.06
2008-03-21T16:31:00.000Z	MenZa	Yancho	What is your partition layout, currently?
2008-03-21T16:32:00.000Z	Yancho	MenZa	what command u prefer so i show it to u? df -h is ok?
2008-03-21T16:32:00.000Z	MenZa	Yancho	Sure, please pastebin that
2008-03-21T16:34:00.000Z	Yancho	MenZa	: http://yancho.pastebin.com/d588a83af - there is also /dev/hda5 which i just formatted to ext3 .. not appearing there
2008-03-21T16:34:00.000Z	MenZa	Yancho	So, you don't have a seperate /home?
2008-03-21T16:35:00.000Z	MenZa	Yancho	You have several partitions on your main drive?
2008-03-21T16:35:00.000Z	MenZa	Yancho	Then you can resize those partitions and expand your / partition
2008-03-21T16:36:00.000Z	Yancho	MenZa	i have 15GB partition free
2008-03-21T16:36:00.000Z	Yancho	MenZa	is it safe?
2008-03-21T16:36:00.000Z	MenZa	Yancho	It should be safe.
2008-03-21T16:37:00.000Z	Yancho	MenZa	doing it
2008-03-21T16:40:00.000Z	Yancho	MenZa	: i am reading the faq and it doesnt talk about resizing an already filled up partition :) sorry im being too scared
2008-03-21T16:41:00.000Z	MenZa	Yancho	I've had pretty good experiences with it
2008-03-21T16:41:00.000Z	MenZa	Yancho	Including resizing a huge NTFS drive, creating an ext3 drive and various other pieces of maintenance at once
2008-03-21T16:41:00.000Z	Yancho	MenZa	hope mine will be the same :)
