2012-05-23T18:21:00.000Z	Lunar_Lander		I clicked the top left button
2012-05-23T18:21:00.000Z	Lunar_Lander		the "start menu"
2012-05-23T18:22:00.000Z	Lunar_Lander		but it didn't open up on the first click and then it made a "jerky" movement and then the message came
2012-05-23T18:22:00.000Z	Lunar_Lander		yeah
2012-05-23T18:22:00.000Z	Lunar_Lander		that was the very first time I got that
2012-05-23T18:22:00.000Z	Lunar_Lander		never got such a message on 11.10
2012-05-23T18:22:00.000Z	Lunar_Lander		and I got 12.04 for about a week now
2012-05-23T18:22:00.000Z	Lunar_Lander		thus I was confused
2012-05-23T18:23:00.000Z	Lunar_Lander		sorry
2012-05-23T18:23:00.000Z	Lunar_Lander		here: the last days when I switched to 12.04, the PC froze several times when running YouTube, I thought that there was an issue with Flash, now yesterday there was an update coming in called "linux-headers-3.2.0-24-generic-pae" and "linux-image-3.2.0-24-generic-pae", since then the hanging didn't happen agai
2012-05-23T18:25:00.000Z	mneptok	Lunar_Lander	what's the "question" part of that second question?
2012-05-23T18:25:00.000Z	Lunar_Lander	mneptok	ah sorry, copying error on my side
2012-05-23T18:28:00.000Z	mneptok	Lunar_Lander	the kernel is the core of any operating system. the kernel passes requests from software to hardware. in the case of Flash, which is a LOT of assembly language, the kernel is a big part of the recipe.
2012-09-02T18:29:00.000Z	mneptok	Lunar_Lander	just disable the Java browder plugin for now
2012-09-02T18:30:00.000Z	Lunar_Lander	mneptok	I just went into Firefox and then Extras-Addons-Plugins
2012-09-02T18:31:00.000Z	mneptok	Lunar_Lander	the best way to check is to go to "about:plugins" in the browser
2012-09-02T18:31:00.000Z	mneptok	Lunar_Lander	yes
2012-09-02T18:33:00.000Z	Lunar_Lander	mneptok	especially was helpful to get the "Synchronize with Google Now" thing out of chrome
