2006-10-03T15:56:00.000Z	porkpie		Hi guy's can any one tell me when there will be a new release to fix the Dell 1950 problems ???
2006-10-03T15:57:00.000Z	porkpie		Dr_willis:will there be a 6.0.6.2 version of dapper .....to fix the PERC 5/i and Broadcom issues on the Dell PE1950
2006-10-03T15:58:00.000Z	Dr_willis	porkpie	no clue - ask in  on the edgy channel/check the edgy forums
2008-08-13T16:45:00.000Z	Dr_willis	porkpie	 you did cofigure vncserver to launch the lxde desktop?
2008-08-13T16:46:00.000Z	Dr_willis	porkpie	 what 'did' you do then to get vnc going? I normally install vnc4server, edit the users .vnc/xstartup and have that script launch whatever desktop i want.
2008-08-13T16:47:00.000Z	porkpie	Dr_willis	ah ... OK I didn't edit the ./vnc/xstartup
2008-08-13T16:47:00.000Z	porkpie	Dr_willis	is the a doc to do this
2008-08-13T16:47:00.000Z	Dr_willis	porkpie	 the vnc4server docs perhaps..  a read of the 'vncserver' script is handy also. (its a fancy script that is well commented)
2008-08-13T16:48:00.000Z	Dr_willis	porkpie	 xstartup is just a simple script - example (2 lines) --> xterm &   exec gnome-session
2008-08-13T16:48:00.000Z	Dr_willis	porkpie	 that would launch gnome in the vncsession. change it to lauinch what you want
2008-08-13T16:49:00.000Z	Dr_willis	porkpie	 be carefull when running 'vncserver' you can accidently get several vncsessions going at the same time. :) use the vncserver -kill :#  to kill off any extras running
2008-08-13T16:51:00.000Z	porkpie	Dr_willis	not sure if lxde  is the right tag
2008-08-13T16:51:00.000Z	Dr_willis	porkpie	 i have no idea. try lxd<tab> and see what commands its using.
2008-08-13T16:51:00.000Z	Dr_willis	porkpie	 or check the lxde.desktop file that the gdm  tool is using.. see what its executing
2008-08-13T16:57:00.000Z	porkpie	Dr_willis	hmm! made the change but still get a grey desktop
2008-08-13T16:58:00.000Z	Dr_willis	porkpie	 you did KILL and restart the vncserver?  also at the end of the xstartup you may want to use another 'xterm' or 'gnome-terminal' (no &) to keeop a termial open if the windowmanager  closes. also check the logs.
2008-08-13T17:08:00.000Z	porkpie	Dr_willis	looks like it is using gnome display manager
2008-08-13T17:31:00.000Z	porkpie	Dr_willis	can I post my config for vnc  ... driving me nuts here I am only getting a grey back ground with an x
