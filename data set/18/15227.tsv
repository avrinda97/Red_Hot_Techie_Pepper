2005-04-30T12:05:00.000Z	darkaudit	Seveas	so a functionality bug that's not security-related may be ignored?

2005-04-30T12:06:00.000Z	Seveas	darkaudit	if it is a serious bug, it might get updated
2005-04-30T12:07:00.000Z	darkaudit	Seveas	it's marked as pending upload in bugzilla... big bug with choosing folders in file-roller and others... it's actually a gtk bug
2005-04-30T12:08:00.000Z	Seveas	darkaudit	in Ubuntu bugzilla? If that is so, it will be updated

2005-05-28T06:20:00.000Z	darkaudit	Seveas	but the firefox site rejects it as being their current version
2005-05-28T06:20:00.000Z	Seveas	darkaudit	let it fake its User-Agent string...
