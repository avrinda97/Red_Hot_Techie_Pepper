2008-08-01T03:32:00.000Z	Stavros		i would like to run my own SMTP server (with encryption and authentication), does anyone know of a tutorial to help me?
2008-08-01T03:33:00.000Z	Stavros		i only want outgoing mail from that server, not incoming
2008-08-01T03:34:00.000Z	cellofellow	Stavros	I wish I knew more, email servers are a PITA, but maybe you can find some how to's using Exim 4 or Postfix.
2008-08-01T03:34:00.000Z	Stavros	cellofellow	i'm looking, but it looks like i have to change the config by hand quite a bit :/
2008-08-01T03:35:00.000Z	Stavros	cellofellow	unfortunately gmail isn't good enough
2008-08-01T03:35:00.000Z	cellofellow	Stavros	Yeah, I use Gmail for some stuff, and have Gmail as my SmartHost on my Exim installation. Annoyingly it rewrites the from: in my mail headers to only my email address.
2008-08-01T03:36:00.000Z	cellofellow	Stavros	but, with the configuration files, that's the only way to do it. As far as I know the only email server that uses GUI configs is Exchange and who wants to use that?
2008-08-01T03:36:00.000Z	Stavros	cellofellow	i don't like how it adds the sender: address of the gmail account even when i use alternate addresses
2008-08-01T03:36:00.000Z	Stavros	cellofellow	not me :p
2008-08-01T03:37:00.000Z	Stavros	cellofellow	the problem with those tutorials is that you never know if they're up to date, and may end up with a broken installation
2008-08-01T03:37:00.000Z	cellofellow	Stavros	if at first you don't succeed, try try again.
2008-08-01T03:39:00.000Z	Stavros	cellofellow	if i want to send mail through it, do i need to send the local-nets for relaying to anything, or just to localhost?
2008-08-01T03:40:00.000Z	cellofellow	Stavros	It'd be better to find a good smarthost that doesn't rewrite headers, your ISPs maybe, because home servers are often blocked as an anti-spam measure.
2008-08-01T03:40:00.000Z	cellofellow	Stavros	they're blocked by the receiving server.
2008-08-01T03:41:00.000Z	Stavros	cellofellow	i can rewrite my domain's SPF field for that, though
2008-08-01T03:41:00.000Z	cellofellow	Stavros	SFS field? Now you've lost me.
2008-08-01T03:41:00.000Z	Stavros	cellofellow	SPF, sender policy framework
2008-08-01T03:43:00.000Z	cellofellow	Stavros	looks like you just need to knuckle down and do it.
