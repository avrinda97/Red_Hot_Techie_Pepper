2010-01-28T15:59:00.000Z	Sargun		I've already hit a few issues in Ubuntu that I didn't touch in Gentoo
2010-01-28T16:01:00.000Z	Sargun		:-/
2010-01-28T16:02:00.000Z	Sargun		ew, atime is enabled.
2010-01-28T16:02:00.000Z	Sargun		Man, what's up with the IO scheduler, I'm running a copy in the background and it's completely bringing my system to a halt
2010-01-28T16:03:00.000Z	Sargun		apt-get remove
2010-01-28T16:03:00.000Z	Sargun		purge/remove, close enough
2010-01-28T16:03:00.000Z	Sargun		I come from a CentOS/Gentoo background
2010-01-28T16:03:00.000Z	Sargun		where emerge -C was god.
2010-01-28T16:05:00.000Z	Sargun		unreal-ircd is fine for small installs
2010-01-28T16:05:00.000Z	Sargun		erm, inspircd, not unreal, unreal is actually pretty rad.
2010-01-28T16:06:00.000Z	faileas	Sargun	eh. irc isn't really a 'proper' IM. IMO
2010-01-28T16:07:00.000Z	Sargun	faileas	ejabberd is awesome
2010-01-28T16:07:00.000Z	faileas	Sargun	well, since he explicitely mentioned having trouble with it... unless you could work out what's wrong... ;p
2010-01-28T16:08:00.000Z	Sargun		oh, sorry, I didn't see that
2010-01-28T16:08:00.000Z	Sargun		what issues were you hitting with ejabberd?
2010-01-28T16:08:00.000Z	Sargun	faileas	what's wrong with irc?
2010-01-28T16:08:00.000Z	faileas	Sargun	...eep. i think i got confused
2010-01-28T16:08:00.000Z	faileas	Sargun	its just not an IM client ;p
