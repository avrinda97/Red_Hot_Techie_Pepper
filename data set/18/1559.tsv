2011-02-08T17:07:00.000Z	Sonne		and you also have both kscreensaver and gnome-screensaver
2011-02-08T17:07:00.000Z	Sonne		they shouldn't start simultaneously thohough
2011-02-08T17:07:00.000Z	user82		they did, know i left the xscreensaver extras which gnome screensaver detects but only one is started/active now
2011-02-08T17:08:00.000Z	Sonne	user82	that's good
2011-02-08T17:09:00.000Z	user82	Sonne	neither synaptic manager nor the software center said xscreensaver is still installed
