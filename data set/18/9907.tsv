2007-06-04T07:43:00.000Z	minerale		How can I disable the graphical startup (ubuntu logo while the system starts up)
2007-06-04T07:44:00.000Z	cables	minerale	permanently, or just for one boot?
2007-06-04T07:44:00.000Z	minerale	cables	permanently
2007-06-04T07:44:00.000Z	cables	minerale	do you want it gone, or do you just want to have it show the boot screen as well as a description of what's happening?
2007-06-04T07:44:00.000Z	cables	minerale	either way, do alt-f2 then type "gksudo gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst"
2007-06-04T07:45:00.000Z	minerale	cables	no, I want it gone, my system does not support it and I only see a blank screen
2007-06-04T07:45:00.000Z	cables	minerale	okay. Do you have the menu.lst file open?
2007-06-04T07:45:00.000Z	minerale	cables	yep, O remove something from the kernel line, right?
2007-06-04T07:45:00.000Z	cables	minerale	no, that will work, but not well.
2007-06-04T07:45:00.000Z	cables	minerale	the thing is, any kernel updates will put it back to the original.
2007-06-04T07:46:00.000Z	cables	minerale	so I want you to find a line that says "defoptions"
2007-06-04T07:46:00.000Z	minerale	cables	got it
2007-06-04T07:46:00.000Z	minerale	cables	it says quiet splash
2007-06-04T07:46:00.000Z	cables	minerale	remove splash
2007-06-04T07:46:00.000Z	cables	minerale	then save and close it
2007-06-04T07:47:00.000Z	cables	minerale	then open a terminal and type this: sudo grub-update
2007-06-04T07:47:00.000Z	minerale	cables	there's no grub-update
2007-06-04T07:48:00.000Z	cables	minerale	sorry, try sudo update-grub
