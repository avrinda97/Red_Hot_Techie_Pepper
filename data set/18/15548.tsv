2005-03-12T15:39:00.000Z	blahrus		anyone know how to remove oo1 and not lose unubutu-desktop?
2005-03-12T15:39:00.000Z	hawke_	blahrus	You can't.
2005-03-12T15:39:00.000Z	hawke_	blahrus	but ubuntu-desktop is not required.
2005-03-12T15:40:00.000Z	blahrus	hawke_	hum . . . why does it claim depenecy on on openoffice 1?
2005-03-12T15:40:00.000Z	blahrus		use gnome apps :)
2005-03-12T15:41:00.000Z	hawke_	blahrus	Because that is considered part of the basic ubuntu desktop system.
2005-03-12T15:41:00.000Z	blahrus	hawke_	alright, then I guess what happens when ubutunu-desktop is removed?
2005-03-12T15:41:00.000Z	hawke_	blahrus	Nothing.
2005-03-12T15:42:00.000Z	blahrus		ahhh
2005-03-12T15:42:00.000Z	hawke_	blahrus	ubuntu-desktop contains nothing, it just depends on stuff.
2005-03-12T15:42:00.000Z	blahrus		I see, I guess its good for newbie, I haven't been using ubuntu very long
2005-03-12T15:43:00.000Z	blahrus	hawke_	you tested graveman yet?
2005-03-12T15:44:00.000Z	hawke_	blahrus	Nope
2005-03-12T15:45:00.000Z	blahrus	hawke_	looks nice.
2005-03-12T15:46:00.000Z	hawke_	blahrus	I'll look at it...I've been looking for a gnome cd burning app that's decent.
2005-03-12T15:46:00.000Z	hawke_	blahrus	preferably competitive with k3b
2005-03-12T15:46:00.000Z	hawke_	blahrus	or burnatonce, in windows
2005-03-12T15:46:00.000Z	blahrus	hawke_	haven't run it yet, installed it on my laptop, installed fine and found my burner.
