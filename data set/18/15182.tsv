2005-10-21T13:05:00.000Z	liable	bsd3	follow this, gimme a yell if you get stuck  http://marc.herbert.free.fr/linux/win2linstall.html
2005-10-21T13:05:00.000Z	liable	bsd3	i just had to install breezy the same way, debootstrap was failing, and this way is way easy..
2005-10-21T13:07:00.000Z	liable	bsd3	if you are installing breezy, the ramdisk_size is wrong, but you can find that out.
2005-10-21T13:07:00.000Z	bsd3	liable	my PXE bootstrap worked fine, i was on, but confused when it asked for a mirror site
2005-10-21T13:07:00.000Z	liable	bsd3	try it, you only need the kernel and initrd installed to disk.
2005-10-21T13:08:00.000Z	bsd3	liable	will not an ISO mounted to a doc-root on another loacl machine work like a mirror?
2005-10-21T13:09:00.000Z	liable	bsd3	quite possibly, never done it myself so i cant say how to access it.
2005-10-21T13:10:00.000Z	bsd3	liable	that wiki site at wiki.ubuntu.com does not have any such thing
2005-10-21T13:10:00.000Z	liable	bsd3	if you got a decent connection, just do it the way that link says.
2005-10-21T13:11:00.000Z	bsd3	liable	le me try, i shall update the wiki pages on success
