2007-04-21T09:05:00.000Z	stellaras		is there anyway to run 7.04 from a usb ?
2007-04-21T09:05:00.000Z	stellaras		is there anyway to run 7.04 from a usb pen drive 1gb ?
2007-04-21T09:06:00.000Z	eck	stellaras	no need to dd, just install grub and copy the files over
2007-04-21T09:07:00.000Z	eck	stellaras	then you would configure grub to run the live cd kernel/initrd
2007-04-21T09:07:00.000Z	stellaras	eck	what is grub ? sorry i'm new to linux
2007-04-21T09:07:00.000Z	eck	stellaras	it is the bootloader ubuntu uses
2007-04-21T09:08:00.000Z	stellaras	eck	is there any web site that explain how to do this?
2007-04-21T09:09:00.000Z	eck	stellaras	I wrote one a while ago, not sure if this is 100% up to date but it should be pretty close: http://eklitzke.org/howto/livehdd.xhtml
2007-04-21T09:10:00.000Z	stellaras	eck	i tried http://www.pendrivelinux.com/2007/01/25/usb-x-ubuntu-610 but when i was at the final step to move the files to the usb the files size was to large
2007-04-21T09:11:00.000Z	eck	stellaras	how large did you make the partition?
2007-04-21T09:11:00.000Z	eck	stellaras	also, i would recommend grub over syslinux, grub can boot fat filesystems (like syslinux) but is more standard and imho easier to use
2007-04-21T09:12:00.000Z	stellaras	eck	ate least i thnk so :)
2007-04-21T09:13:00.000Z	eck	stellaras	maybe you need to make it a little bit bigger? you can't be off by much
2007-04-21T09:14:00.000Z	stellaras	eck	so what i have to try is when the tutorials says +700MB i will write something like +800MB  ?
2007-04-21T09:14:00.000Z	eck	stellaras	correct
2007-04-21T09:14:00.000Z	stellaras	eck	thank you i will try again :)
2007-04-21T10:46:00.000Z	stellaras	eck	thank you, i'm now writing you through gaim using my pendrive's ubuntu 7.04
