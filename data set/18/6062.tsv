2008-11-21T21:12:00.000Z	Vi5in		has anyone tried to mount their T-mobile G1 on ubuntu?
2008-11-21T21:13:00.000Z	Vi5in		it shows up as an sdb, but has no partition info
2008-11-21T21:14:00.000Z	Vi5in		I have a ricoh card-reader (on a dell xps 1530). If you insert the sd card, it shows up as a block device without any partition info.... BUT you can still mount it. running parted to create a partition and filesystem has no effect. df -h still shows no partition.
2008-11-21T21:14:00.000Z	hololight	Vi5in	have you tried other cards?
2008-11-21T21:15:00.000Z	Vi5in	hololight	actually, I haven't. But apparently this is an issue with the cards that come with the G1
2008-11-21T21:16:00.000Z	hololight	Vi5in	I would say try another card first
2008-11-21T21:16:00.000Z	hololight	Vi5in	any data on the card you would miss?
2008-11-21T21:16:00.000Z	Vi5in	hololight	I'll try that - but I was just wondering what would cause the card to behave like that, especially if it does have a partition and a fs on it
2008-11-21T21:17:00.000Z	Vi5in	hololight	nope. I backed up the data, and wiped it clean
2008-11-21T21:17:00.000Z	hololight	Vi5in	I am wondering if the partition table is messed up somehow. try to repartition and format it.
2008-11-21T21:17:00.000Z	hololight	Vi5in	also try another card
2008-11-21T21:18:00.000Z	Vi5in	hololight	yeah, I did that. apparently the cards have a messed up partition table. tried to fix it, but no dice :( i will try another card - I'll see if i can get one
2008-11-21T21:18:00.000Z	hololight	Vi5in	odd sized card?
2008-11-21T21:20:00.000Z	hololight	Vi5in	why did you run mklabel?
2008-11-21T21:24:00.000Z	Vi5in	hololight	i was actually following instructions from here:

2008-11-21T21:28:00.000Z	hololight	Vi5in	okay, I looked at that... it doesn't have you running mklabel from what I saw... actually it appears all you are doing is wiping the card and creating a brand new vfat partition
2008-11-21T21:30:00.000Z	hololight	Vi5in	still there?
