2007-01-23T11:34:00.000Z	m0Z		hi. I am new to linux and ubuntu. Im trying to install freeglut. i've downloaded a .tar.gz file that i've extracted. when i run ./configure i get the following error... configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables. anyone knows the issue?
2007-01-23T11:35:00.000Z	EnsignRedshirt	m0Z	Isn't there a freeglut package in the ubuntu repositories?
2007-01-23T11:35:00.000Z	m0Z		thank you
2007-01-23T11:37:00.000Z	EnsignRedshirt	m0Z	edgy has freeglut3, if that is any help.
2007-01-23T11:38:00.000Z	m0Z	EnsignRedshirt	today is my first day using ubuntu and linux, so im not exactly sure what you mean :P
2007-01-23T11:38:00.000Z	EnsignRedshirt	m0Z	Which version of ubuntu are you using?
2007-01-23T11:38:00.000Z	m0Z		6.10
2007-01-23T11:39:00.000Z	EnsignRedshirt	m0Z	Then there is a precompiled ubuntu package for freeglut that you can use.
2007-01-23T11:39:00.000Z	m0Z		ok cool!
2007-01-23T11:40:00.000Z	EnsignRedshirt	m0Z	Run Synaptic, and search for freeglut.
2007-01-23T11:41:00.000Z	m0Z		how can i run synaptic?
2007-01-23T11:42:00.000Z	EnsignRedshirt	m0Z	I think: System -> Administration ->Synaptic Package Manager
2007-01-23T11:42:00.000Z	m0Z		ok thnx found it
2007-01-23T11:43:00.000Z	m0Z		ok EnsignRedshirt. found freeglut3 and it also says it's installed
2007-01-23T11:44:00.000Z	EnsignRedshirt	m0Z	Are you installing freeglut so you can compile some other program that uses it?  If so, you also need freeglut3-dev
2007-01-23T11:44:00.000Z	m0Z		ah yes
2007-01-23T11:44:00.000Z	m0Z		thnx
2007-01-23T11:44:00.000Z	EnsignRedshirt	m0Z	But, since you have synaptic right there, you might as well see if that program is already in the repositories ;)
