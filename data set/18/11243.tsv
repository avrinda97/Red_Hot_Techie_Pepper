2006-09-12T09:29:00.000Z	effer		is there a linux-friendly news site with video?  i missed the presidential address at 9:00, and i really want to see it....and despite all my efforts, i still have trouble with cnn.com's video
2006-09-12T09:29:00.000Z	acersales	effer	this is something to the browser not to linux
2006-09-12T09:30:00.000Z	acersales	effer	just use mozilla browser rather than firefox
2006-09-12T09:30:00.000Z	effer	acersales	ok, i'll try that, thanks :)
2006-09-12T09:30:00.000Z	acersales	effer	or add the plugin if any in for that media player
2006-09-12T09:30:00.000Z	acersales	effer	you welcome
2006-09-12T09:31:00.000Z	effer	acersales	what's the command for mozilla browser?  i'm not sure if i have it installed...
2006-09-12T09:32:00.000Z	acersales	effer	what version of linux you are using ? ubuntu ?
2006-09-12T09:32:00.000Z	effer	acersales	kubuntu 6.06
2006-09-12T09:32:00.000Z	acersales	effer	then most likely you are using konqueror
2006-09-12T09:33:00.000Z	effer	acersales	i was using firefox...will cnn video work in konqueror?
2006-09-12T09:33:00.000Z	acersales		Application >>> Internet .>>> FireFox
2006-09-12T09:33:00.000Z	acersales	effer	 i think you better download Mozilla Browser
2006-09-12T09:34:00.000Z	acersales	effer	hopefully that works
2006-09-12T09:34:00.000Z	acersales	effer	then install real player plugin and flash plugin
2006-09-12T09:34:00.000Z	effer	acersales	ok, thanks again :)
