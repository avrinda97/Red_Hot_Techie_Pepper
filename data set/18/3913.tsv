2009-07-09T13:53:00.000Z	vise		apt-get is telling me that there are a few packages that had been installed automatically and are no longer required. Should i trust it ans use apt-get autoremove? I have installed stuff from sources too. I don't always use the package manager.
2009-07-09T13:54:00.000Z	richardcavell	vise	why wouldn't you trust it?
2009-07-09T13:54:00.000Z	vise	richardcavell	Since i have installed packages using sources too. That means it might not have the correct information. right?
2009-07-09T13:55:00.000Z	richardcavell	vise	if you downloaded the sources as a package it shouldn't make any difference
2009-07-09T13:55:00.000Z	vise	richardcavell	I downloaded few softwares in the tar.gz/tar.bz2 form and did configure, make, make install on them without concerning the package manager.
2009-07-09T13:56:00.000Z	richardcavell	vise	then how does your package manager know that they exist?
2009-07-09T13:57:00.000Z	vise	richardcavell	It doesnt.. These packages it mentions that are no longer required, have been installed with packages that i installed from the package manager. But what if the source installs were using them.. I might be confusing you.. If so. never mind.. I will just do an autoremove if the disk space is critical..
2009-07-09T13:58:00.000Z	richardcavell	vise	I understand what you mean. But it shouldn't make any difference.
2009-07-16T11:13:00.000Z	vise	richardcavell	Whats the error?
2009-07-16T11:15:00.000Z	vise	richardcavell	Don't you see any specific error while resuming that prevents it?
2009-07-19T19:54:00.000Z	vise	richardcavell	As he says, if its in the 'exes' then it may not be possible imho
2009-07-19T19:55:00.000Z	richardcavell	vise	he might need to go to Windows to be able to disinfect the computer
2009-07-19T19:55:00.000Z	richardcavell	vise	he can certainly find them from within ubuntu
2009-07-19T19:55:00.000Z	richardcavell	vise	I find them all the time in my firefox caches
2009-07-19T19:55:00.000Z	richardcavell	vise	And I don't visit dodgy websites
2009-07-19T19:56:00.000Z	richardcavell	vise	well if he can't boot windows then why does it matter if he has windows viruses on his puter?
2009-07-19T19:57:00.000Z	vise	richardcavell	data/installations
2009-07-19T19:57:00.000Z	vise	richardcavell	actually software installations i guess
