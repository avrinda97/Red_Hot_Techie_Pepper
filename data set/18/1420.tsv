2011-03-12T11:16:00.000Z	andruHA1123		Hey guys, can anyone tell me why xubuntu is super slow on an older computer, but is really fast in a VMware with the same specs?
2011-03-12T11:18:00.000Z	ohzie	andruHA1123	Probably because of video drivers?
2011-03-12T11:18:00.000Z	ohzie	andruHA1123	if you have an older computer don't use compositing on xfce. It defeats the purpose of xfce on a slower computer. ( ,_,)
2011-03-12T11:18:00.000Z	andruHA1123	ohzie	can i install drivers manually? if so, how?
2011-03-12T11:19:00.000Z	ohzie	andruHA1123	what version of xubuntu are you using?
2011-03-12T11:20:00.000Z	andruHA1123	ohzie	i installed Xubuntu as it seemed to use the least ram and still be very functional
2011-03-12T11:23:00.000Z	andruHA1123	ohzie	what distro would you recommend for a computer with 256mbs of ram and 1.2ghz cpu? (im trying to make something like a fileserver with this old PC, but need gui)
2011-03-12T11:24:00.000Z	ohzie	andruHA1123	Ubuntu, even xubuntu, is not good for old things unless you install ubuntu-server than then put a bare minimum gui on top of that.
2011-03-12T11:25:00.000Z	ohzie	andruHA1123	I'd suggest ubuntu-server and aptitude install blackbox
2011-03-12T11:26:00.000Z	andruHA1123	ohzie	what is blackbox? like a lightweight gui?
2011-03-12T11:26:00.000Z	ohzie	andruHA1123	 very very lightweight gui. It's too lightweight for most people to tolerate. That or tdm are going to be your best friends if you absolutely need some sort of GUI......
2011-03-12T11:27:00.000Z	ohzie	andruHA1123	out of curiosity, what is the GUI needed for?
2011-03-12T11:27:00.000Z	andruHA1123	ohzie	i will need it to set up what I need.. I don't know how to do everything in terminal
2011-03-12T11:29:00.000Z	ohzie	andruHA1123	Weeeelllllll what things are you doing setup in the GUI, and maybe I can point you in the right direction of where to learn? =) Blackbox+vnc server are going to be great fallbacks if you need the gui, but SSH is faster and runs a lot lighter. :3
2011-03-12T11:29:00.000Z	ohzie	andruHA1123	Not plugging the OMG GUI ON A SERVER thing, I don't judge, I'm just saying that help is aailable. =P
2011-03-12T11:30:00.000Z	andruHA1123	ohzie	oh, i would probably uninstall gui once im done configuring what i need
2011-03-12T11:36:00.000Z	ohzie	andruHA1123	DSL
2011-03-12T11:37:00.000Z	andruHA1123	ohzie	i tried dsl and it wouldn't run latest firefox...
