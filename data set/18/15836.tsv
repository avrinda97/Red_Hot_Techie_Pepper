2005-02-07T07:15:00.000Z	lavigj		hey guys, question. is there a way to install just a couple "unstable" packages, without switching to hoary?
2005-02-07T07:17:00.000Z	socomm	lavigj	Get the backport of firefox 1.0.
2005-02-07T07:18:00.000Z	lavigj	socomm	is there good docs on backports? i haven't even heard of those.... or farruinn just answered some questions
2005-02-07T07:18:00.000Z	socomm	lavigj	Read farruinn reply a few lines up.
2005-02-07T07:18:00.000Z	lavigj	socomm	farruinn: that's all that's needed?
2005-02-07T07:19:00.000Z	socomm	lavigj	Yes.
2005-02-07T07:19:00.000Z	socomm	lavigj	Use synaptic.

2005-02-07T07:22:00.000Z	lavigj	socomm	thanks. I am actually about to reinstall ubuntu because hoary made my system a bit broken. this is a relatively new install, so I don
2005-02-07T07:22:00.000Z	lavigj	socomm	mind
2005-02-07T07:22:00.000Z	lavigj	socomm	but it si good to know about the backports
2005-02-07T07:23:00.000Z	socomm	lavigj	You don't need to reisntall.
2005-02-07T07:24:00.000Z	lavigj	socomm	:: shrugs:: I would just as soon reinstall, needed or not. I can be sure it is clean, and get familiar with the installer and such again.
