2011-11-11T21:56:00.000Z	vsingh165		is anyone experiencing intermittent wifi connection issues on oneiric 64-bit?  I have an rt61pci-based linksys card on wpa-psk personal
2011-11-11T21:57:00.000Z	blind	vsingh165	I am indeed ! but I'm 32 bit. any chance one of your partitions is remounting itself?
2011-11-11T21:57:00.000Z	vsingh165		usually my connection is good, but sometimes it drops out and firefox keeps trying to "look up" a URL rather than just go to it
2011-11-11T21:57:00.000Z	vsingh165		and sometimes I have to try my WPA-PSK passkey several times b4 I get an IP
2011-11-11T21:57:00.000Z	vsingh165	blind	do you use WPA, WEP, or any other security on your wifi
2011-11-11T21:58:00.000Z	blind	vsingh165	yes, yes, and yes. i have the same issues. sometimes i have to turn off wireless and then back on before it works again
2011-11-11T21:58:00.000Z	blind		WPA2
2011-11-11T21:58:00.000Z	vsingh165	blind	the only thing I ever see in the log files when my connection fails is along the lines of "deauthentication (reason 6)"
2011-11-11T21:59:00.000Z	vsingh165	blind	 I'm not sure what reason 6 means when it comes to failed authentication
2011-11-11T21:59:00.000Z	blind	vsingh165	mine's either reason 1 or 3
2011-11-11T21:59:00.000Z	vsingh165	blind	 maybe it's different for different wireless drivers/cards?
2011-11-11T21:59:00.000Z	blind		possible.. honestly don't know. it's actually why I'm here right now
2011-11-11T22:00:00.000Z	vsingh165	blind	 I wish there was some way to contact the people that code the kernel modules for wifi cards.
2011-11-11T22:00:00.000Z	vsingh165		maybe they would know
2011-11-11T22:01:00.000Z	vsingh165	blind	 what module does your card use?
2011-11-11T22:01:00.000Z	blind	vsingh165	b43 - it's a broadcom
2011-11-11T22:01:00.000Z	vsingh165	blind	 I have fond memories of using ndiswrapper for getting broadcoms to work under Ubuntu lol
2011-11-11T22:02:00.000Z	blind	vsingh165	funny.. i have memories, but they're not fond :P
