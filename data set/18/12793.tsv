2006-03-07T15:08:00.000Z	Stormx2		Can someone gimme a hand? I need to run a command in gnome terminal on boot. How? :(
2006-03-07T15:09:00.000Z	dang`r`us	Stormx2	system->preferences->sessions ->startup programs
2006-03-07T15:10:00.000Z	dang`r`us	Stormx2	then like I described
2006-03-07T15:10:00.000Z	Stormx2	dang`r`us	I know. But I don't know the command for running a specific command in gnome-terminal
2006-03-07T15:11:00.000Z	dang`r`us	Stormx2	gnome-terminal should have a cmdline switch for this
2006-03-07T15:11:00.000Z	dang`r`us	Stormx2	consult the manpage
2006-03-07T15:11:00.000Z	Stormx2	dang`r`us	I did x.x
2006-03-07T15:11:00.000Z	dang`r`us	Stormx2	it's right there, the first option
2006-03-07T15:12:00.000Z	Stormx2	dang`r`us	I tried that though. The gnome-terminal window comes up, and goes away straight away
2006-03-07T15:12:00.000Z	dang`r`us	Stormx2	that means your command has finished, probably
2006-03-07T15:12:00.000Z	dang`r`us	Stormx2	append a "; read foo" to your command
2006-03-07T15:13:00.000Z	Stormx2	dang`r`us	It hasn't though. When I run it in an already open window, the command keeps going.
2006-03-07T15:14:00.000Z	dang`r`us	Stormx2	do the read foo thing, maybe your program is not being found or something.
2006-03-07T15:14:00.000Z	Stormx2	dang`r`us	I'll give it a go
2006-03-07T15:15:00.000Z	Stormx2	dang`r`us	I'm using this line: gnome-terminal -e=cd\ /media/Win98/moojava/classes;\ java\ runTWOServer;
2006-03-07T15:16:00.000Z	dang`r`us	Stormx2	well, I don't know about your runTWOServer ... do the read foo thing ;)  (and escape spaces as needed or put the whole thing in quotes)
2006-03-07T15:18:00.000Z	dang`r`us	Stormx2	ah ... it's not a bash that's executing the commands
2006-03-07T15:19:00.000Z	dang`r`us	Stormx2	I'd follow soundray's suggestion
