2007-04-04T05:04:00.000Z	andresmujica		hi i've just upgraded from dapper to edgy, and i'm having trouble with the kernel. it is still the same from dapper.. it diidn't upgrade the kernel what could be wrong?? any pointers or any package i must install again??? Thanks
2007-04-04T05:05:00.000Z	Flannel	andresmujica	how didyou upgrade?
2007-04-04T05:06:00.000Z	Flannel	andresmujica	what does 'uname -a' return?
2007-04-04T05:06:00.000Z	Flannel	andresmujica	and you've restarted?
2007-04-04T05:07:00.000Z	Flannel	andresmujica	very odd.  You didn't have any issues with update-manager?
2007-04-04T05:08:00.000Z	andresmujica	Flannel	humm it ask 2 or 3 times if i wanted to overwrite some files, but nothing related to kernel, only bluetooth and things like that... i've choosen to rewrite everything.
2007-04-04T05:09:00.000Z	Flannel	andresmujica	odd.  Well, hmm.  pastebin your sources.list, just to make sure.
2007-04-04T05:09:00.000Z	Flannel	andresmujica	to make sure nothing is abnormal, then yeah, we'll do some manual upgrades/installations
2007-04-04T05:11:00.000Z	andresmujica	Flannel	this is my sources.list , dapper repos are commented out http://pastebin.ca/423168
2007-04-04T05:12:00.000Z	andresmujica	Flannel	do you think i must fill a bug, or search for something similar previously reported???
2007-04-04T05:13:00.000Z	Flannel	andresmujica	Odd.  Well, do this `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade`  see what it wants to upgrade
2007-04-04T05:14:00.000Z	andresmujica	Flannel	this is what it wants to upgrade http://pastebin.ca/423175 .. no kernel
2007-04-04T05:15:00.000Z	Flannel	andresmujica	do you have linux-image-686 installed?
2007-04-04T05:17:00.000Z	Flannel	andresmujica	Do you have linux-image-686 installed?
2007-04-04T05:18:00.000Z	andresmujica	Flannel	hmmm seems that is not there dpkg -l | grep linux-image-686 .. root@dieguito:/etc/apt #
2007-04-04T05:19:00.000Z	Flannel	andresmujica	eh?  Why are you using root?  Anwyay.  That's your issue.  You haven't gotten kernel updates in quite a while actually.  For edgy, install linux-image-generic
2007-04-04T05:20:00.000Z	Flannel	andresmujica	you should probably file a bug against update-manager, mentioning that it doesn't automatically check for a kernel metapackage
2007-04-04T05:21:00.000Z	andresmujica	Flannel	thanks!! it's downloading right now
