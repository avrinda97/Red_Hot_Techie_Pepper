2008-11-29T05:06:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Xylia2	Still here?
2008-11-29T05:07:00.000Z	Xylia2	Jordan_U	Yes, I'm here. Did I miss something?

2008-11-29T05:07:00.000Z	Xylia2	Jordan_U	I managed to set up ethernet. Would it be easier to download them to the hard drive of the computer in question?
2008-11-29T05:08:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Xylia2	Yes, if you have an ethernet connection then just install fwcutter and it will offer to download those files for you ( and extract the firmware from them )
2008-11-29T05:13:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Xylia2	Did installing b43-fwcutter work?
2008-11-29T05:13:00.000Z	Xylia2	Jordan_U	Okay, I downloaded both of them, and yes, I downloaded b43-fwcutter a few minutes ago, but I don't see how to use it with these.
2008-11-29T05:14:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Xylia2	If you are connected to the internet then all you have to do is install b43-fwcutter, during the install process it will do everything for you
2008-11-29T05:15:00.000Z	Xylia2	Jordan_U	Okay, what is it supposed to be doing?
2008-11-29T05:16:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Xylia2	It is downloading the windows driver and extracting just the firmware ( the code that runs on the card, not the actual driver ) so that the firmware can be loaded onto the card, the reason it needs to do this is that boradcom won't allow Ubuntu to distribute their firmware directly
2008-11-29T05:18:00.000Z	Xylia2	Jordan_U	Okay, makes sense. How do I confirm it did this? I downloaded both of the files you linked after downloading b43-fwcutter, but it didn't do anything that I can see.
2008-11-29T05:19:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Xylia2	Did you actually install b43-fwcutter? "sudo apt-get install b43-fwcutter" in a terminal or with synaptic if you prefer a GUI
2008-11-29T05:22:00.000Z	Xylia2	Jordan_U	I tried it in the terminal, and got two errors (Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (11 resource temporarily unavailable) and Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/, is another process using it?). The problem might be that I'm trying to download all the system updates now in the hope they'll help in some way. However, when I just type b43-fwcutter, I get a description and list of commands, so I thin
2008-11-29T05:29:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Xylia2	If the updates are still downloading you can just cancel and re start the updates later ( what you have downloaded will still be there ), if you have already install b43-fwcutter but you weren't connected to the internet when you did run "sudo /usr/share/b43-fwcutter/install_bcm43xx_firmware.sh"
2008-11-29T05:31:00.000Z	Xylia2	Jordan_U	I did that and it seems to have worked (much stuff was apparently saved and extracted)
2008-11-29T05:39:00.000Z	Xylia2	Jordan_U	How should I download those two files? I saved them to my desktop using firefox, but that doesn't seem to do what you're expecting.
2008-11-29T05:43:00.000Z	Xylia2	Jordan_U	still here?
