2008-06-10T21:29:00.000Z	yell0w	eix	erhh comment out that swap part if you don't want it ?
2008-06-10T21:30:00.000Z	eix	yell0w	if I comment the swap partition I will get 1024MB?
2008-06-10T21:31:00.000Z	yell0w	eix	what exactly is your memory/swap condition and what you want out of it ?
2008-06-10T21:32:00.000Z	eix	yell0w	I have 1024MB of RAM but I can see only less than half, so I am wondering who's taking the rest

2008-06-10T21:38:00.000Z	yell0w	eix	restart, go to BIOS/SETUP, lookup the value there
2008-06-10T21:38:00.000Z	eix	yell0w	the same redneck will check that for me

2008-06-10T21:40:00.000Z	eix	yell0w	Jack_Sparrow: running lshw I can see UNCLAIMED memory blocks and devices...that looks creepy!

2008-06-10T21:47:00.000Z	yell0w	eix	i don't know whta those UNCLAIMED are for, but the entry above it says you have only 512 MB ram in one bank out of the four banks
