2006-11-15T14:17:00.000Z	whiteandnerdy	fribuntu	I have tried the media thingy that came with GNOME that I hated, mplayer, vlc, and amaroK.
2006-11-15T14:16:00.000Z	fribuntu	whiteandnerdy	Which player are you using? Concerning the wmv-problems
2006-11-15T14:23:00.000Z	fribuntu	whiteandnerdy	Did you install mplayer and win32codecs?
2006-11-15T14:23:00.000Z	whiteandnerdy	fribuntu	yes.
2006-11-15T14:25:00.000Z	fribuntu	whiteandnerdy	if you start mplayer from a console, can you paste the debug messages into a pastebin?
2006-11-15T14:25:00.000Z	whiteandnerdy	fribuntu	sure
2006-11-15T14:25:00.000Z	fribuntu	whiteandnerdy	I mean, a debug message when you are trying to decode a WMV of course
2006-11-15T14:26:00.000Z	whiteandnerdy	fribuntu	WOW you're good.  it played.
2006-11-15T14:27:00.000Z	fribuntu	whiteandnerdy	:)
2006-11-15T14:27:00.000Z	fribuntu	whiteandnerdy	Glad I could give you emotional support
2006-11-15T14:28:00.000Z	whiteandnerdy	fribuntu	:)
2006-11-15T14:29:00.000Z	fribuntu	whiteandnerdy	now I just wish someone could help me with my problem. How to get openVPN support into the ubuntu/gnome networkmanager.
2006-11-15T14:40:00.000Z	fribuntu	whiteandnerdy	It is probably the Super-FAQ
2006-11-15T15:21:00.000Z	fribuntu	whiteandnerdy	You can write your own little shell script first scping and then rming :)
2006-11-15T15:21:00.000Z	whiteandnerdy	fribuntu	hehe true
2006-11-15T15:22:00.000Z	whiteandnerdy	fribuntu	-- Because people who run VPNs are smart enough to use ttys for configuration?  :D
2006-11-15T15:23:00.000Z	fribuntu	whiteandnerdy	I have no problems configuring openvpn, but I think having a nice little button to start it instead of firing up a shell and do it manually, is a good idea. And since I am using network-manager for WLAN settings already and plugins do exist outside the Ubuntu world, I'd very much like to use it.
