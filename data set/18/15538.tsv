2005-03-08T08:48:00.000Z	error_29		good evening, does anybody use Audacity, and know how to stop a crackling distortion?
2005-03-08T08:49:00.000Z	pauldaoust	error_29	best way is to use 32-bit float format instead of the usual 16-bit, and ummmm... try playing around with the volume levels; maybe it's only being distorted on playback. when exactly do you get distortion?
2005-03-08T08:51:00.000Z	pauldaoust	error_29	you shouldn't be getting cracklies when playing back in Audacity though... I've never had that problem...
2005-03-08T08:53:00.000Z	pauldaoust	error_29	do you get the cracklies when you're recording, or when you're playing back?
2005-03-08T08:54:00.000Z	error_29	pauldaoust	only when playing back something just recorded
2005-03-08T08:54:00.000Z	pauldaoust	error_29	cuuuuurious
2005-03-08T08:56:00.000Z	pauldaoust	error_29	hum. Audacity does have its own volume controls; I assume you've played around with those, eh?
2005-03-08T09:01:00.000Z	pauldaoust	error_29	that's a stumper.
2005-03-08T09:01:00.000Z	error_29	pauldaoust	I agree with you on Mandrake!
2005-03-08T09:02:00.000Z	pauldaoust	error_29	yeah, wish I could help :-/
2005-03-08T09:03:00.000Z	pauldaoust	error_29	glad you agree with me about Mandrake :) I find Mandrake's controls are too spread out and scattered... mind you, I'm also comfortable with going to the command line if there's a setting missing from any of Ubuntu's graphical thingies
2005-03-08T09:04:00.000Z	pauldaoust	error_29	gee whiz, no :) I wouldn't know where to get a (legitimate) copy of CoolEdit anyway... I just use Ardour and JACK
2005-03-08T09:04:00.000Z	pauldaoust	error_29	rather steep learning curve, but it's a beautiful program once you get over its idiosyncracies
2005-03-08T09:06:00.000Z	pauldaoust	error_29	heh heh
2005-03-08T09:08:00.000Z	pauldaoust	error_29	how so?
2005-03-08T09:16:00.000Z	pauldaoust	error_29	I never did get BeOS to work on my computer, which is a shame, because it always looked so cool and sensible.
2005-03-08T09:18:00.000Z	pauldaoust	error_29	Celeron, back then. TheMuso: yeah, Jack is pretty astounding...
2005-03-08T09:22:00.000Z	error_29	pauldaoust	thanks for your audacious help -- :-) time for some tube and some grub G'night
