2012-03-04T02:45:00.000Z	Zaitzev		i've just had an interesting experience with installing ubuntu on a laptop
2012-03-04T02:46:00.000Z	Zaitzev		with dualbooting and stuff..
2012-03-04T02:46:00.000Z	Zaitzev		well
2012-03-04T02:46:00.000Z	Zaitzev		it went completely batshit
2012-03-04T02:46:00.000Z	Zaitzev		first try anyway
2012-03-04T02:47:00.000Z	Zaitzev		it must've been an issue with the win7 installation or something
2012-03-04T02:47:00.000Z	Zaitzev		weird partitioning or whatever
2012-03-04T02:48:00.000Z	Zaitzev		it basically resulted in windows 7 not being able to be booted anymore.
2012-03-04T02:49:00.000Z	Zaitzev		oh, right. didn't see that. :P
2012-03-04T02:50:00.000Z	Zaitzev		In any case, what I had to do was wipe the entire drive, remove all partitions and start from scratch. That sucked since it had a bunch of data that'll take a while getting back.
2012-03-04T02:51:00.000Z	minixvbox	Zaitzev	the virtue of backups is a lesson you need not learn the hard way
2012-03-04T02:52:00.000Z	Zaitzev	minixvbox	had nowhere to backup to. either way, the files aren't "lost forever" as they can be redownloaded. it's just gonna take some time (30-40 GB of data)
2012-03-04T02:53:00.000Z	minixvbox	Zaitzev	you should always have somewhere to backup your files, otherwise your data isn't important to you
2012-03-04T02:53:00.000Z	minixvbox	Zaitzev	i keep an external harddrive just for backups
2012-03-04T02:53:00.000Z	Zaitzev	minixvbox	it was my brothers laptop, and the files lost was his World of Warcraft data and patches, hahaha
2012-03-04T02:54:00.000Z	minixvbox	Zaitzev	bet he loves you :)
2012-03-04T02:54:00.000Z	Zaitzev		among a few other files, but all in all not a huge loss. Personally I have both cloud and local backup for the most important stuff :)
2012-03-04T02:54:00.000Z	Zaitzev	minixvbox	He has to, since he doesn't have anyone else to turn to for tech support. Nothing is worse than being on a techie's sh*tlist as we all know.. ;)
