2009-11-06T15:33:00.000Z	Dretje		hello, I just did an upgrade from version 9.04 to 9.10 but now my Wireless hardware is not fully recognized. I am using the SMC 2835W EU (not v2) PC card
2009-11-06T15:33:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Dretje	and it worked fine in 9.04 yes?  Well many people have experienced problems after upgrading 9.04 to 9.10.
2009-11-06T15:35:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Dretje	well  not much in 9.10  that is worth it end user featurewise, as in stuff you see.   It's still ok to run 9.04,  it has  about a year of support left,   plus  10.04 will be out at the end of April which is the next Long Term Support version,  which has to be pretty good, or I have a feeling quite a few people wil be leaving Ubuntu
2009-11-06T15:38:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Dretje	If it worked fine in 9.04,  not much point really trying to configure it in 9.10 in my opinion,  just put 9.04 back on.   Or even try some other distros if you want.
2009-11-06T15:39:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Dretje	also calling 9.04 a downgrade isn't  quite right, because with Ubuntu it's not about what is the latest version or  the Long Term Support version,  it's about which releases are still supported
2009-11-06T15:39:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Dretje	sometimes an older version is going to be better for a user, beasue of the user them selves, or their hardware, or both
2009-11-06T15:40:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Dretje	Newer is not always better!
2009-11-06T15:41:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Dretje	Well I suggest checking out the release notes when a new version comes out
2009-11-06T15:41:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Dretje	Then you can also make a more educated decision if your going to upgrade or not.
2009-11-06T15:41:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Dretje	Plus if you wait a bit  you can check out this channel for the issues.
2009-11-06T15:42:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Dretje	Before  you  get it yourself or not.
2009-11-06T15:44:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Dretje	Yes that's something else you can do  test it,  on a spare computer,  or in a virtual machine or whatever, whilst  it's in development,  I have been doing this since Alpha 4 on this one, so got boot up issues still, but when I get round to installing the final,  that should go away.   It's looking like the weekend when I do OS stuff on this computer.
2009-11-06T15:45:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Dretje	,but from what I have seen of 9.10 I am not impressed, so  i'll be keeping the other computer on 9.04 for now.   Plus  how if I upgrade it I might get issues, and I don't feel like clean installing Ubuntu any time soon on there.
2009-11-06T15:50:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Dretje	Vsphere??
2009-11-06T15:51:00.000Z	Dretje	sebsebseb	Vmware v4
2009-11-06T15:51:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Dretje	sounds like an old version of  a VMware product
2009-11-06T15:51:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Dretje	not sure what versions they are currently on
2009-11-06T15:52:00.000Z	sebsebseb	Dretje	plus most people recommend Virtualbox in here
