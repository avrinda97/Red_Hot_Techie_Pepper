2006-08-11T09:42:00.000Z	{K}Lubby		hey everyone, i have a question
2006-08-11T09:42:00.000Z	{K}Lubby		how do i get a ubuntu computer to connect to my windows xp computer (this one) using a crossover cable?
2006-08-11T09:43:00.000Z	{K}Lubby		when i go to edit the connection settings for a static ip and stuff, it say's that it could not enable the interface eth0
2006-08-11T09:43:00.000Z	{K}Lubby		so seth, how do i configure them?
2006-08-11T09:44:00.000Z	{K}Lubby		the ubuntu one needs to have an ip of 192.168.0.(something), subnet 255.255.255.0, gateway 192.168.0.1, dns server 192.168.0.1
2006-08-11T09:45:00.000Z	{K}Lubby		or is there another way to set up the network other than system-->administration-->network settings?
2006-08-11T09:46:00.000Z	{K}Lubby		and if it makes a difference, im running ubuntu from an iso cd (it's not actually installed yet)
2006-08-11T09:47:00.000Z	{K}Lubby		anyone know how to fix it so it will let me have a static ip without having an error that dis-activates the connection?
2006-08-11T09:48:00.000Z	{K}Lubby		seth, thats my problem
2006-08-11T09:48:00.000Z	{K}Lubby		it won't let me set a static ip
2006-08-11T09:48:00.000Z	el_isma	{K}Lubby	ifconfig ethX up 123.123.123.123 ?
2006-08-11T11:29:00.000Z	el_isma	{K}Lubby	well... it's mostly that... the speed of you HD....
2006-08-11T11:29:00.000Z	el_isma	{K}Lubby	depends on hardware
2006-08-11T11:29:00.000Z	el_isma	{K}Lubby	then you've got a slow HD
2006-08-11T11:40:00.000Z	el_isma	{K}Lubby	use synaptic / aptitude / adept
2006-08-11T11:43:00.000Z	el_isma	{K}Lubby	Indeed, only if you run unknown programs as root you'll have trouble... otherwise, you're pretty safe
2006-08-11T14:52:00.000Z	el_isma	{K}Lubby	synaptic/adept/aptitude
2006-08-11T14:58:00.000Z	el_isma	{K}Lubby	I'd guess it's safer if you have net->ubuntu->xp. But I think you said you had a router, in which case it doesn't really matter, the router already filters all harm
