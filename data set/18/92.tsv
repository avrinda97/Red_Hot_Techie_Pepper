2012-11-05T19:00:00.000Z	cuddylier		How do I make /var/www/multicraft/protected/runtime writeable by the user 'minecraft'? I have looked through those permissions and just got more confused..
2012-11-05T19:02:00.000Z	blazemore	cuddylier	You make sure the "minecraft" user owns it with "chown minecraft: /var/www/multicraft/protected/runtime"
2012-11-05T19:02:00.000Z	blazemore	cuddylier	Then make sure "owner" has write permission bits set using chmod
2012-11-05T19:02:00.000Z	cuddylier		I don't have the user owner though blazemore
2012-11-05T19:02:00.000Z	blazemore	cuddylier	So chmod 644 would be owner read/write, world-read
2012-11-05T19:03:00.000Z	blazemore	cuddylier	if you don't own it, you can't change permissions on it. Obviously.
2012-11-05T19:03:00.000Z	cuddylier		I did chown minecraft: /var/www/multicraft/protected/runtime but same error
2012-11-05T19:03:00.000Z	cuddylier	blazemore	http://198.15.69.170/multicraft/install.php
2012-11-05T19:03:00.000Z	blazemore	cuddylier	Otherwise the whole concept of security would be pointless. cuddylier root can do it
2012-11-05T19:03:00.000Z	blazemore	cuddylier	try "sudo chown..."
2012-11-05T19:03:00.000Z	cuddylier		Yeah, I made this use seperate users though which seems wrong..
2012-11-05T19:03:00.000Z	cuddylier		good idea
2012-11-05T19:05:00.000Z	cuddylier	blazemore	I think the command worked as I'm using the root account currently but still same error :S
2012-11-05T19:05:00.000Z	cuddylier		When I changed the file permission numbers it worked but I want to do that without changing those permissions
2012-11-05T19:10:00.000Z	blazemore	cuddylier	What is the actual error?
2012-11-05T19:10:00.000Z	cuddylier	blazemore	'Application runtime path "/var/www/multicraft/protected/runtime" is not valid. Please make sure it is a directory writable by the Web server process.'
2012-11-05T19:16:00.000Z	blazemore	cuddylier	What user is running the "web server process"?
2012-11-05T19:48:00.000Z	cuddylier	blazemore	The root user is
