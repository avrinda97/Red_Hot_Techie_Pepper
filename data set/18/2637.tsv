2010-07-10T00:56:00.000Z	chadi	realubot	yeah, it worked fine
2010-07-10T00:56:00.000Z	realubot	chadi	I have had the problem severl times. One time it was due to a graphics setting in BIOS (a "Vista thing") and other times I think it has to du with the graphics card of the computer you are trying to boot into.
2010-07-10T00:56:00.000Z	chadi	realubot	one more point, my friend's laptop is very recent, could it be some new drivers?
2010-07-10T00:57:00.000Z	chadi	realubot	is it a USB-related thing, or would the same behavior occur with a live cd?
2010-07-10T00:58:00.000Z	realubot	chadi	Yes, it problably could. I hav ehad problems getting Ubuntu to work on a very new laptop, but I don't really know what the problem is. You could of course google the laptop model and Ubuntu problem. Some other persons may have had the same problem as you do
2010-07-10T00:58:00.000Z	realubot	chadi	What is the model of the laptop?
2010-07-10T00:58:00.000Z	chadi	realubot	thank you :) it's a new toshiba
2010-07-10T00:59:00.000Z	chadi	realubot	but I don't know the exact model cause the laptop isn't mine and I don't have it right now
2010-07-10T00:59:00.000Z	realubot	chadi	You could try to boot from another USB port. I suppose the computer has got more than one USB-port. Try another one just to be sure.
2010-07-10T00:59:00.000Z	chadi	realubot	good point, haven't thought of it
2010-07-10T01:00:00.000Z	realubot	chadi	It may be due to the USB ports. A friend had a laptop that didn't handla his cam but the cam worked just fine at my computer using the exactly same version of Ubuntu and the cam worked on his computer using Windows.
2010-07-10T01:01:00.000Z	chadi	realubot	great, will try all these suggestions as soon as I get my hands on this laptop again :D
2010-07-10T01:03:00.000Z	realubot	chadi	I don't if it does work but it may be worth a try at least. The booting problem be due to a lot of things I think.
2010-07-10T01:03:00.000Z	realubot	chadi	Maybe you shall try booting a Live CD from cdrom too just to be sure.
2010-07-10T01:04:00.000Z	chadi	realubot	will do :) thank you
2010-07-10T01:04:00.000Z	realubot	chadi	If neither USB or CD works then I think it has do to the graphics card or the setting of it in BIOS.
2010-07-10T01:05:00.000Z	realubot	chadi	There are also a lot of possibilities to change the way Ubuntu shall boot from the Live CD menu, but I don't really know the options. You can't set some different options at te Live Cd menu that change how Ubuntu Live shall try to boot.
