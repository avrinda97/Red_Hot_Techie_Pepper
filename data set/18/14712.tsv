2005-06-24T13:03:00.000Z	chombee		Does anyone know of an easy way to install the acx100 driver for wireless cards?
2005-06-24T13:04:00.000Z	cazabam	chombee	I just put the card in and it worked ?
2005-06-24T13:04:00.000Z	chombee	cazabam	- that didn't happen for me, D-Link DWL-650+
2005-06-24T13:05:00.000Z	cazabam	chombee	hehe, same card too! what did happen?
2005-06-24T13:06:00.000Z	chombee	cazabam	- the card is detected as wlan0 but is not activated, ifup tries to dhcp it but the lights on the card aren't on and it doesn't succeed
2005-06-24T13:07:00.000Z	cazabam	chombee	in that case the driver is loaded and it's just not finding your router or access point
2005-06-24T13:07:00.000Z	chombee	cazabam	- I don't think so, the dhcp wireless router is there, the lights on the wireless card are not coming on, there's a link light and a pwr light
2005-06-24T13:08:00.000Z	cazabam	chombee	at a terminal, do: iwlist wlan0 scanning
2005-06-24T13:08:00.000Z	cazabam	chombee	and iwconfig wlan0
2005-06-24T13:09:00.000Z	cazabam	chombee	just to see what it can see
2005-06-24T13:09:00.000Z	chombee	cazabam	- okay, the scan completed, and it gives some info
2005-06-24T13:09:00.000Z	chombee	cazabam	- it has detected the name of our router
2005-06-24T13:09:00.000Z	chombee	cazabam	- cou;d it have gone through the wired connection to get that?
2005-06-24T13:10:00.000Z	cazabam	chombee	no, the iw* tools only do wireless - so it can see the router
2005-06-24T13:11:00.000Z	cazabam	chombee	check to make sure that the router doesn't require WEP or a specific MAC - open that thing up for the world :)
2005-06-24T13:15:00.000Z	chombee	cazabam	- woot! now what do we do? this other laptop I'm typing on is working fine through wireless
2005-06-24T13:15:00.000Z	chombee	cazabam	- it doesn't, just DHCP
2005-06-24T13:17:00.000Z	cazabam	chombee	have you configured which network you want it to point at?
