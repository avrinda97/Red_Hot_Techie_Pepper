2009-04-27T21:44:00.000Z	chocobanana		Does anyone know why does Jaunty eat so much of my laptop battery? WinXP can go up to 4:15hr without wireless and the screen dimmed to about 40%. Jaunty doesn't give more than 2:15 under the same conditions! Any clues?
2009-04-27T21:44:00.000Z	somatt	chocobanana	try scaling, disk spinups, putting your monitor to sleep instead of using screensaver
2009-04-27T21:44:00.000Z	chocobanana	somatt	already does all that
2009-04-27T21:45:00.000Z	somatt		oh
2009-04-27T21:45:00.000Z	somatt		I'm using jaunty, here is my errors at the end of my apt-get update:  ttp://pastebin.com/m29b860b1 I believe I've broken the sources.
2009-04-27T21:45:00.000Z	somatt		can anyone help me with this issue?
2009-04-27T21:46:00.000Z	chocobanana	somatt	I did all tweaks with powertop, screen sleeps after 3min., no bluetooth either...
