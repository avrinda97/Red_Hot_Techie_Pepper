2011-09-09T11:08:00.000Z	Tsunami99		I need some help can I find it here??
2011-09-09T11:09:00.000Z	urlin2u	Tsunami99	ask your question and see. :D
2011-09-09T11:11:00.000Z	urlin2u	Tsunami99	classic or unity desktop?
2011-09-09T11:11:00.000Z	urlin2u	Tsunami99	have you tweaked compiz?
2011-09-09T11:15:00.000Z	urlin2u	Tsunami99	hard to say as you removed compiz so it would be using metacity, try in the terminal if you can metacity --replace
2011-09-09T11:16:00.000Z	urlin2u	Tsunami99	killall gnome-panel
2011-09-09T11:17:00.000Z	urlin2u	Tsunami99	it restarts it.
2011-09-09T11:18:00.000Z	urlin2u	Tsunami99	for the panel  killall gnome-panel

2011-09-09T11:23:00.000Z	Tsunami99	urlin2u	I killed the panel and restore it to default will it be enough to solve the problem??
2011-09-09T11:26:00.000Z	urlin2u	Tsunami99	your fixating on the kill command just run what the bot said.
