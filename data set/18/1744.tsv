2010-11-24T20:10:00.000Z	ottar		i have a powerful gpu with latest drivers and it still "lags" when drawing windows in gnome
2010-11-24T20:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ottar	what video chip ?
2010-11-24T20:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ottar	yuo havent answered my question
2010-11-24T20:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ottar	what video chip is it. lspci | grep -i vga    will tell you
2010-11-24T20:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ottar	what driver does nvidia-settings say you are using?
2010-11-24T20:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ottar	what driver version does nvidia-settings say you are using currently?
2010-11-24T20:32:00.000Z	ottar	ActionParsnip	it did not solve the problem
2010-11-24T20:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ottar	tried a different refresh rate?
2010-11-24T20:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ottar	searched for bugs to see if its a known issue?
2010-11-24T20:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ottar	searched for xorg.conf examples?
2010-11-24T20:43:00.000Z	ottar	ActionParsnip	i think the problem is with powermizer,it shows that the gpu is running at minimum levels
2010-11-24T20:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ottar	that'll do it, you can remove / add the option in xorg.conf to disable that
2010-11-24T20:53:00.000Z	ottar	ActionParsnip	powermizer wasnt the problem after all, got the card going max performance
2010-11-24T20:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ottar	sweet move dude :)
2010-11-24T20:54:00.000Z	ottar	ActionParsnip	yeah, but i still get the lines :(
2010-11-24T20:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	ottar	try a different driver
2010-11-24T20:58:00.000Z	ottar	ActionParsnip	 gonna try 256 instead, thanks for your help :)
