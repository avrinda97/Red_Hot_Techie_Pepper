2007-02-12T13:15:00.000Z	chris_		anyone an expert in here?
2007-02-12T13:16:00.000Z	mojo	chris_	i am not an expert in here, but i am an expert in there
2007-02-12T13:16:00.000Z	chris_	mojo	not quite sure I am interpreting that the way you meant it, but if I am, your a bad boy !! <grin>
2007-02-12T13:17:00.000Z	mojo	chris_	just playing on words..  expert in metallugy, expert in dunebuggy racing, expert in "here"... it is late
2007-02-12T13:18:00.000Z	mojo	chris_	but tell more about your configuration.  you have an ubuntu box with multiple nics and are bridging the two?
2007-02-12T13:26:00.000Z	mojo	chris_	the load on the server has not gone up lately has it?  maybe the box is just really busy using bandwidth for it's own tasks... it is a server of some sort, right>
2007-02-12T13:27:00.000Z	chris_	mojo	yeah, load has actually gone down.. used to be frequently abused with Battlefield 2 clients
2007-02-12T13:31:00.000Z	mojo	chris_	sounds drastic
2007-02-12T13:32:00.000Z	mojo	chris_	the box itself gets good throughput, right?
2007-02-12T13:33:00.000Z	chris_	mojo	the box itself will attain the 3mb speeds, but it won't pass that speed thru
2007-02-12T13:33:00.000Z	mojo	chris_	how about client on lan side to services on the box, not thru the box?
2007-02-12T13:36:00.000Z	chris_	mojo	yeah, speeds from server to clients are good.. only thing that is being affected currently is when it's traffic from Wan to Lan clients
2007-02-12T13:37:00.000Z	chris_	mojo	my first suspicions were the firewall/shorewall, but I just didn't seen anything there to suspect as a problme
2007-02-12T13:38:00.000Z	mojo	chris_	you would think something must have changed somewhere... oh, and firestarter/shorewall et all are just really front ends to iptables, methinks
2007-02-12T13:38:00.000Z	chris_	mojo	yes, your correct
2007-02-12T13:39:00.000Z	chris_	mojo	but it's a decent frontend for someone that was too lazy to learn iptables
2007-02-12T13:40:00.000Z	mojo	chris_	have you done any measurements on which procs are running on the server to see what is using its cpu time?  run some tests before, during, an after attempts at large transfers from a client?  see what's moving with the load>?
