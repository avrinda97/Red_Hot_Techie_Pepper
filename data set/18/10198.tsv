2007-01-05T09:58:00.000Z	nn531		hey how come i cant play wmv files in firefox, i installed the mozilla-mplayer package
2007-01-05T09:59:00.000Z	pike_	nn531	w32codecs
2007-01-05T09:59:00.000Z	nn531	pike_	installed those too
2007-01-05T09:59:00.000Z	nn531	pike_	it worked on one video and then it never worked again
2007-01-05T09:59:00.000Z	pike_	nn531	if you go to about:plugins  in firefox addressbar does mplayer show up?
2007-01-05T10:00:00.000Z	nn531	pike_	application/x-mplayer2
2007-01-05T10:01:00.000Z	pike_	nn531	you could do "pkill firefox" then ""mv ~/.mozilla ~/.mozilla-old" and restart firefox to see if its a profile thing
2007-01-05T10:02:00.000Z	pike_	nn531	im assuming firefox2 is still under .mozilla and not .firefox now
2007-01-05T10:02:00.000Z	nn531	pike_	what does that mean
2007-01-05T10:04:00.000Z	pike_	nn531	~ just means /home/yourusername  you can use them interchangably. there is a direcotory containing config files in your home dir for most apps firefox is normally under .mozilla
2007-01-05T10:04:00.000Z	pike_	nn531	when you remove the config directory the next time it starts it will create a new one. so its like you run it for the first time
2007-01-05T10:05:00.000Z	nn531	pike_	no dice, it's still sittin there being dumb
2007-01-05T10:05:00.000Z	nn531	pike_	it's supposed to load inside the video thing right?
2007-01-05T10:06:00.000Z	pike_	nn531	ah. then if you had any bookmarks or aything id do pkill firefox and mv .mozilla-old .mozilla to get profile back.  yes
2007-01-05T10:06:00.000Z	pike_	nn531	rm the current .mozilla first
2007-01-05T10:07:00.000Z	nn531	pike_	oh well im not too worried about the bookmark I lost
2007-01-05T10:13:00.000Z	nn531	pike_	is there a w32 codec for edgy? i think I might install that, I installed dapper before
2007-01-05T10:14:00.000Z	pike_	nn531	well im still in dapper so im not aware of any issues with edgy and the normal w32codecs but i have used different ones at times because of trouble playing .asf files in normal package
