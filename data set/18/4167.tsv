2009-06-01T09:55:00.000Z	sagaci		how long would rhythmbox take to compile
2009-06-01T09:56:00.000Z	KDewhirst	sagaci	it's a pain. why do you want to compile it?
2009-06-01T09:56:00.000Z	KDewhirst	sagaci	you can change your repo if it's a really big deal
2009-06-01T09:57:00.000Z	KDewhirst	sagaci	there are too many factors. it'll take longer than you want to wait, though
2009-06-01T09:58:00.000Z	KDewhirst	sagaci	it could easily be a lot more than that
2009-06-01T10:01:00.000Z	KDewhirst	sagaci	you can kill the compile if you want
2009-06-01T10:01:00.000Z	KDewhirst	sagaci	you're not doing something crazy like compiling into /bin/, are you?
2009-06-20T11:28:00.000Z	KDewhirst	sagaci	the owner of the process is root, what's the process's name?
2009-06-20T11:28:00.000Z	KDewhirst	sagaci	oops, sorry, wrong person
2009-06-20T11:31:00.000Z	KDewhirst	sagaci	see if you have a gconf file with a ~ at the end of the name
2009-06-20T11:33:00.000Z	KDewhirst	sagaci	run this in a terminal: ls -a | grep gtkrc
2009-06-20T11:33:00.000Z	sagaci	KDewhirst	nothing
2009-06-20T11:34:00.000Z	KDewhirst	sagaci	are you in your home directory?
2009-06-20T11:34:00.000Z	KDewhirst	sagaci	hm, try this: ls -a | grep *gtk*
2009-06-20T11:35:00.000Z	KDewhirst	sagaci	that's very strange
2009-06-20T11:36:00.000Z	KDewhirst	sagaci	i'm a kde user, but i was under the impression that the gtkrc was right in the home folder
2009-06-20T11:37:00.000Z	KDewhirst	sagaci	that's scary
