2005-11-16T15:56:00.000Z	DigitalLF		!tell digitallf sysklog
2005-11-16T15:57:00.000Z	DigitalLF		hehe worth a try :)
2005-11-16T07:20:00.000Z	DigitalLF		anyone know howto recive over tcp in syslog-ng to a file called lets say /var/log/myfirewall?
2005-11-16T07:21:00.000Z	Ng	DigitalLF	syslog tends to use udp and I'm not sure if you can separate out by host
2005-11-16T07:22:00.000Z	DigitalLF	Ng	okey but is there a way to get everything from the network to a file
2005-11-16T07:23:00.000Z	Ng	DigitalLF	not really, syslog determins where to put a log entry by its facility (ie mail, kernel, cron, etc) and priority (info, notice, warning, error, etc)
2005-11-16T07:23:00.000Z	Ng	DigitalLF	so all mail.info from all hosts will go to the file you specify for mail.info
2005-11-16T07:23:00.000Z	DigitalLF	Ng	syslog-ng is the one im running
2005-11-16T07:28:00.000Z	Ng	DigitalLF	the hostname is logged, so you can grep easily enough
2005-11-16T07:38:00.000Z	Ng	DigitalLF	http://www.snort.org/docs/faq/1Q05/node50.html
2005-11-16T07:41:00.000Z	Ng	DigitalLF	read the link I sent you, or read man syslog.conf
2005-11-16T07:42:00.000Z	Ng	DigitalLF	or, better yet, http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/24
2005-11-16T07:44:00.000Z	DigitalLF	Ng	man syslog.conf dident give me anything but i will sure read the article
2005-11-16T07:44:00.000Z	Ng	DigitalLF	that debian-administration one specifically covers syslog-ng and exactly the situation you are talking about, I believe
2005-11-16T07:45:00.000Z	Ng	DigitalLF	I was wrong earlier about not being able to do it, I was thinking of the default syslogd, sorry
2005-11-16T07:48:00.000Z	DigitalLF	Ng	that article sure did i will go offline to reconnect the firewall and try it out thank you for all the help and i have been on google the 3h before comming here for help
2005-11-16T07:48:00.000Z	DigitalLF	Ng	no problem =)
