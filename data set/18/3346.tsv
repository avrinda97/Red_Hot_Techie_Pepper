2012-03-26T11:56:00.000Z	almoxarife	dalek_	and you authorized correctly?
2012-03-26T12:04:00.000Z	almoxarife	dalek_	six minutes is along time, too long, something is not right
2012-03-26T12:05:00.000Z	dalek_	almoxarife	ok thanks. Maybe the startup disk creator failed after all. Trying again now.]
2012-03-30T11:14:00.000Z	almoxarife	dalek_	are you on a ubuntu system?
2012-03-30T11:15:00.000Z	dalek_	almoxarife	yes. That is what I am using currently.
2012-03-30T11:22:00.000Z	almoxarife	dalek_	why not  'sudo apt-get install nvidia-current' and install it if its not installed?
2012-03-30T11:23:00.000Z	almoxarife	dalek_	and I would assume 'dkms' is already installed
2012-03-30T11:24:00.000Z	dalek_	almoxarife	it tells me nvidia-current is already installed.
2012-03-30T11:25:00.000Z	almoxarife	dalek_	so we are back to the script-kiddie tweaks you have added on to the xorg conf via god knows
2012-03-30T11:26:00.000Z	dalek_	almoxarife	i haven't added anything to xorg.conf
2012-03-30T11:27:00.000Z	almoxarife	dalek_	when you bootup, do you get to a graphics screen ?
2012-03-30T11:28:00.000Z	dalek_	almoxarife	all I've done is activate a driver in additional drivers window and run an update through update manager. I get no graphics at all during boot up.
2012-03-30T11:32:00.000Z	almoxarife	dalek_	install from the 'alternate' iso , be brave
2012-03-30T11:33:00.000Z	dalek_	almoxarife	I only have the i386 desktop version on my usb stick
2012-03-30T11:34:00.000Z	almoxarife	dalek_	and? got a 32bit system I assume
2012-03-30T11:35:00.000Z	dalek_	almoxarife	my point is, I am not sure how to download and write the alternate 11.10 installer onto my usb stick via a tty terminal
2012-03-30T11:38:00.000Z	almoxarife	dalek_	me either
2012-03-30T11:39:00.000Z	almoxarife	dalek_	yes
