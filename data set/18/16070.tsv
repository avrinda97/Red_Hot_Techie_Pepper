2005-09-28T13:04:00.000Z	Seveas		it will replace some
2005-09-28T13:04:00.000Z	Seveas		for instance konqueror will be set to default browser
2005-09-28T13:04:00.000Z	Seveas		yeah, it sucks
2005-09-28T13:04:00.000Z	volvoguy	Seveas	it didn't do that on my install. firefox remained the default browser in gnome.
2005-10-22T15:30:00.000Z	Seveas	volvoguy	no it might kill your cat :)
2005-10-22T15:30:00.000Z	volvoguy	Seveas	dang.
2005-10-22T15:31:00.000Z	volvoguy	Seveas	which cat? that one's getting kinda old anyway.
2005-10-22T15:32:00.000Z	Seveas	volvoguy	lsof /mount/point/of/drive
2005-10-22T15:32:00.000Z	volvoguy	Seveas	thx.
2005-10-22T15:32:00.000Z	Seveas	volvoguy	probably it's gam_server
2005-10-22T15:34:00.000Z	volvoguy	Seveas	leagris, i'm getting no output from either command.
2005-10-22T15:37:00.000Z	volvoguy	Seveas	"lsof: status error on /media/music: Input/output error"
2005-10-22T15:38:00.000Z	volvoguy	Seveas	how bad would it be to unmount the drive on the server end?
2005-10-22T15:38:00.000Z	Seveas	volvoguy	just umount -f it on the client side
2005-10-22T15:38:00.000Z	volvoguy	Seveas	it seems only the samba stuff is hosed.
2005-10-22T15:38:00.000Z	volvoguy	Seveas	-f didn't work.
2005-10-22T15:41:00.000Z	Seveas	volvoguy	mounting problems may even require a reboot
2005-10-22T15:42:00.000Z	volvoguy	Seveas	ok. I'll BRB. :-)
