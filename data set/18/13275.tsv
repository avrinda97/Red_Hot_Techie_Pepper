2007-01-19T17:58:00.000Z	qopi		does Edgy come with firefox 2?
2007-01-19T06:01:00.000Z	HymnToLife	qopi	what does this output ?              dpkg -l | grep firefox
2007-01-19T06:04:00.000Z	qopi	HymnToLife	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/2095/ - looks like I do have 2 from that
2007-01-19T06:04:00.000Z	HymnToLife	qopi	your firefox is 2.0 indeed
2007-01-19T06:06:00.000Z	qopi	HymnToLife	hmz, any idea when I go to Help -> Mozilla Firefox it says 1.5.03? and I thought Firefox 2 had little x's to close on each tab?
2007-01-19T06:06:00.000Z	HymnToLife	qopi	run firefox from a terminal
2007-01-19T06:08:00.000Z	qopi	HymnToLife	yep, when I just type firefox in the terminal it still says 1.5.03
2007-01-19T06:09:00.000Z	HymnToLife	qopi	pastebin the output of           ls -l $(which firefox)
2007-01-19T06:09:00.000Z	qopi	HymnToLife	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/2096/
2007-01-19T06:10:00.000Z	HymnToLife	qopi	you installed a Mozilla.com FF build, didn't you ?
2007-01-19T06:11:00.000Z	qopi	HymnToLife	/me shrugs, quite possibly a long time ago, like I said, think I might have done some hack to get 1.5 working ages ago, but I can't remember to be honest :P
2007-01-19T06:11:00.000Z	HymnToLife	qopi	yes, you did :)
2007-01-19T06:12:00.000Z	qopi	HymnToLife	heh ok, I'll take your word for it, I don't really care, I just want Firefox 2, I guess I want the Ubuntu one though
2007-01-19T06:12:00.000Z	HymnToLife	qopi	first, delete the symlink : sudo rm /usr/bin/firefox
2007-01-19T06:14:00.000Z	qopi	HymnToLife	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/2097/ :)
2007-01-19T06:16:00.000Z	HymnToLife	qopi	       sudo rm /usr/bin/mozilla-firefox && sudo ln -s /usr/lib/firefox/firefox /usr/bin
2007-01-19T06:25:00.000Z	HymnToLife	qopi	dit it work ?
2007-01-19T06:26:00.000Z	qopi	HymnToLife	but my fonts has got a lot worse :( (and they were bad already after my upgrade to Edgy)
