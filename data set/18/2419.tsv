2010-05-23T06:06:00.000Z	usr13	kr3w	So, you
2010-05-23T06:06:00.000Z	usr13	kr3w	So, you're saying you don't much like KDE?
2010-05-23T06:06:00.000Z	kr3w	usr13	i don't like it, nope, sorry!
2010-05-23T06:07:00.000Z	usr13	kr3w	Well, stick with what you like....
2010-05-23T06:07:00.000Z	kr3w	usr13	trust me, i did. used all 3 for a day and my choice has been made
2010-05-23T06:08:00.000Z	kr3w	usr13	the amount of modifications i had to make to each to make it look the way i enjoy, GNOME was the best

2010-05-23T06:10:00.000Z	usr13	kr3w	We have been told to take such discussions to #ubuntu-offtopic
2010-05-23T06:40:00.000Z	usr13	kr3w	You sure?  What does df say?   Or, df -h
2010-05-23T06:41:00.000Z	usr13	kr3w	Are you talking about how much Hard Drive space is actually being used?  (Or how much you've allocated for the OS...)
2010-05-23T06:42:00.000Z	usr13	kr3w	What does   df -h    say?
2010-05-23T06:42:00.000Z	kr3w	usr13	don't understand how to get to that or do that
2010-05-23T06:42:00.000Z	usr13	kr3w	Open a terminal window and type    df -h    and hit enter.
2010-05-23T06:45:00.000Z	usr13	kr3w	Ok, that's enough....
2010-05-23T06:46:00.000Z	kr3w	usr13	pm
