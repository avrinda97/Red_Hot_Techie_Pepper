2012-05-28T17:37:00.000Z	burek		is this official ubuntu support channel?
2012-05-28T17:37:00.000Z	burek		where can I report misleading behavior of ubuntu maintainer(s)
2012-05-28T17:37:00.000Z	burek		bug?
2012-05-28T17:37:00.000Z	jrib	burek	what exactly are you referring to?
2012-05-28T17:41:00.000Z	jrib	burek	seems to me like ffmpeg is now developed as libav?
2012-05-28T17:41:00.000Z	burek	jrib	libav is a fork
2012-05-28T17:42:00.000Z	jrib	burek	what makes you think that message comes from the maintainer?
2012-05-28T17:42:00.000Z	burek	jrib	the original source code doesn't have that message
2012-05-28T17:42:00.000Z	jrib	burek	I don't see a patch with it
2012-05-28T17:43:00.000Z	burek	jrib	I'm not sure I see what are you suggesting?
2012-05-28T17:43:00.000Z	jrib	burek	I'm guessing that ubuntu/debian have moved on to libav and libav provides ffmpeg for compatibility
2012-05-28T17:44:00.000Z	burek	jrib	whatever happened, they changed the source code of ffmpeg to put the misleading message there
2012-05-28T17:45:00.000Z	jrib	burek	the issue is who "they" is
2012-05-28T17:46:00.000Z	jrib	burek	do you understand that the ffmpeg you installed in ubuntu is actually the libav fork?
2012-05-28T17:54:00.000Z	jrib	burek	that message is true from the libav point of view.  ffmpeg isn't even in their tree anymore as popey pointed out
2012-05-28T17:56:00.000Z	jrib	burek	no one is attacking you.  We're just trying to make you understand where that message comes from
2012-05-28T17:56:00.000Z	jrib	burek	in libav, ffmpeg no longer exists
2012-05-28T17:57:00.000Z	jrib	burek	I guess you should read the thread on the mailing list that was linked earlier and discuss it there
