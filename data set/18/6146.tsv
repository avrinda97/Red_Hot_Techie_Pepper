2008-06-20T06:39:00.000Z	jrib	Kelen	system -> administration -> hardware drivers
2008-06-20T06:49:00.000Z	Kelen	jrib	the packages of the from system is not for this graphics card. so i must going to install nvidia driver manual.
2008-06-20T06:49:00.000Z	jrib	Kelen	how did you determine that?
2008-06-20T06:51:00.000Z	jrib	Kelen	then you have to manually reinstall it after kernel upgrades
2008-06-20T06:51:00.000Z	Kelen	jrib	i using NVS 140M, it is not included from system drivers packages .
2008-06-20T06:51:00.000Z	Kelen	jrib	yeah,
2008-06-20T06:52:00.000Z	Kelen	jrib	always do that after some important upgrades.

2008-06-20T06:56:00.000Z	jrib	Kelen	I'm not familiar with your video card, but are you sure not even the nvidia-legacy package works?
2008-06-20T06:57:00.000Z	jrib	Kelen	nvidia-glx-legacy, sorry
2008-06-20T07:00:00.000Z	Kelen	jrib	you mean i should install "nvidia-glx-legacy" for this problem?
