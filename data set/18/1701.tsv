2010-12-20T08:01:00.000Z	mlakics		Linux Newb. Needs help with a new Ubuntu install. Can't get my HP printer to print. Have tried a variety of web/forum suggestions. Can get printer recognized and installed (thru CUPS), and print requests enter Print Queue, but never find their way to printer. PLEASE HELP!!! (my wife is about to forbid Linux)
2010-12-20T08:02:00.000Z	mlakics		Anyone? Please?
2010-12-20T08:03:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mlakics	try installing the latest HPLIP from the HPLIP site
2010-12-20T08:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mlakics	how does the printer attach to the system?
2010-12-20T08:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mlakics	type action then press tab and it will complete my nick nad higlight your text, like mine does to you
2010-12-20T08:05:00.000Z	mlakics	ActionParsnip	Ooooh
2010-12-20T08:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mlakics	much better
2010-12-20T08:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mlakics	i suggest you delete the printer, reboot then let the OS reset it up
2010-12-20T08:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mlakics	easier and it highlights the nick which helps in such a busy channel
2010-12-20T08:07:00.000Z	mlakics	ActionParsnip	Sorry to say, tried that already. Wiped/deleted it fully, and then HPLIP'ed anew. Still goes to Printer Queue, but never to printer.
2010-12-20T08:08:00.000Z	mlakics	ActionParsnip	Also, i saw a post about manually creating a link from pc print queue to printer but no istructions. wasn't sure if that was the answer
2010-12-20T08:08:00.000Z	mlakics	ActionParsnip	sorry for the newb demands and frustrations. :)
2010-12-20T08:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mlakics	its standard question answering...nothing specific to linux at all
2010-12-20T08:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mlakics	you can print directly to cups, the system can be a print server using cups :)
2010-12-20T08:09:00.000Z	mlakics	ActionParsnip	how to config that?
2010-12-20T08:09:00.000Z	mlakics	ActionParsnip	i can remote desktop right now to try
2010-12-20T08:09:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	mlakics	not something I've done, i've always used samba because i'm lazy
2010-12-20T08:12:00.000Z	mlakics	ActionParsnip	gonna walk up with laptopn (what i'm on right now with) and will try wiping everything out for printer. will contact again with results in a few min.
