2009-03-28T07:07:00.000Z	evilnick		Hmmm, so the guide I followed told me to blacklist the driver that Ubuntu installed for my wireless card. To unblacklist it, can I just comment out the line I added?
2009-03-28T07:09:00.000Z	tvih-	evilnick	atheros card by any chance?
2009-03-28T07:10:00.000Z	evilnick	tvih-	How did you know? ;)
2009-03-28T07:12:00.000Z	tvih-	evilnick	spent most of yesterday and this night getting my atheros to work ;P
2009-03-28T07:12:00.000Z	tvih-	evilnick	in the end the only thing that worked was installing the .28 kernel and going from there
2009-03-28T07:12:00.000Z	evilnick	tvih-	Upgrading the kernel? I'm a bit too much of a novice for that
2009-03-28T07:12:00.000Z	tvih-	evilnick	simple task with the precompiled kernels, but yeah, well. couldn't get it to work otherwise myself.
2009-03-28T07:12:00.000Z	tvih-	evilnick	some others have had more luck so i guess you might too
2009-03-28T07:15:00.000Z	tvih-	evilnick	pray it appears in network manager ;P hehe
2009-03-28T07:18:00.000Z	tvih-	evilnick	it should find it automatically if it is working correctly. unless using a hidden ssid.
2009-03-28T07:19:00.000Z	evilnick	tvih-	This could be where I'm going wrong then - I've licked on the network symbol at the top right of the screen and have "Wired Network - Auto eth0" then "Wireless Networks" and no options to pick?
2009-03-28T07:19:00.000Z	evilnick	tvih-	s/licked/clicked/
2009-03-28T07:20:00.000Z	tvih-	evilnick	does it say anything at all under wireless? osomething about not being managed/controlled?
2009-03-28T07:20:00.000Z	evilnick	tvih-	Nothing at all.
2009-03-28T07:21:00.000Z	tvih-	evilnick	which method are you using for your driver now btw? madwifi, ndiswrapper or something else?
2009-03-28T07:21:00.000Z	evilnick	tvih-	I have Wireless Networks as if it's a heading and then a divider then VPN Connections
2009-03-28T07:22:00.000Z	evilnick	tvih-	Am I supposed to use madwifi? I was hoping that it'd work out of the box?
2009-03-28T07:22:00.000Z	tvih-	evilnick	well, most people had to use it with pre-.28 kernels from what I read
