2012-03-19T00:36:00.000Z	jlkkljh		it was wubi
2012-03-19T00:37:00.000Z	auronandace	jlkkljh	not many people here use wubi, its meant to be more of a try before you dive in thing
2012-03-19T00:42:00.000Z	auronandace	jlkkljh	like i said, not a lot of people use wubi
2012-03-19T00:42:00.000Z	auronandace	jlkkljh	tried a proper install?
2012-03-19T00:44:00.000Z	auronandace	jlkkljh	any reason you need to use wubi?
2012-03-19T00:46:00.000Z	auronandace	jlkkljh	you might want to consider installing ubuntu natively or in a vm
2012-03-19T00:48:00.000Z	auronandace	jlkkljh	you want ubuntu as your only os but you installed it inside windows with wubi?
2012-03-19T00:50:00.000Z	auronandace	jlkkljh	don't pm me please
2012-07-12T01:23:00.000Z	auronandace	jlkkljh	with wubi? not many people like it
