2010-06-15T01:18:00.000Z	ALBASL		guys .. how can i install a new login screen
2010-06-15T01:20:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ALBASL	hi
2010-06-15T01:20:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ALBASL	thats easy to do
2010-06-15T01:21:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ALBASL	and theres choice,  KDM :)  LXDM, XDM, and Slim
2010-06-15T01:27:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ALBASL	with 9.10 KDM gets this uhmm  blue circle type theme by default, with 10.04, it gets a even nicer theme by default
2010-06-15T01:21:00.000Z	ALBASL	sebsebseb	hi ...
2010-06-15T01:22:00.000Z	ALBASL	sebsebseb	i just downloaded a login screen from gnome site and i dont know how to install it
2010-06-15T01:23:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ALBASL	KDM is good,  Slim is ok, Debian theme by default if installing from Ubuntu repo, since Ubuntu is based on Debian,  its very customizable, easy to theme, some themes on website, could even make your own
2010-06-15T01:23:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ALBASL	what you downloaded was probably for the old log in screen that Ubuntu was using before 9.10, GDM
2010-06-15T01:23:00.000Z	ALBASL	sebsebseb	its GDM.tar.gz
2010-06-15T01:23:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ALBASL	as of 9.10 it uses GDM 2 instead, which sucks,  you can change the background on it with some program, and thats about it
2010-06-15T01:24:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ALBASL	the old GDM is actsaully in the repo, but its not as simple as just installing and using, so may as well go with one of the alternatives I mentioned :)
2010-06-15T01:25:00.000Z	ALBASL	sebsebseb	aha... so KDM is better
2010-06-15T01:25:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ALBASL	which version you on 10.04?
2010-06-15T01:26:00.000Z	ALBASL	sebsebseb	yes 10.04
2010-06-15T01:27:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ALBASL	as for themeing I am not sure how to do that, but I guess it can be done.  Slim is worth finding out about really as well on its website.
2010-06-15T01:29:00.000Z	ALBASL	sebsebseb	aha .... thanks bro
2010-06-15T01:30:00.000Z	sebsebseb	ALBASL	I guess #kubuntu  can help you theme KDM, if you end up, doing that
