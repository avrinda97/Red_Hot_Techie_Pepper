2008-10-29T01:54:00.000Z	ubun2		hello, can anyone tell me how I could reinstall 'at'?  I had a problem and followed a bug report that said to remove it and re-install.  When I try to apt-get install at, I get: E: Package at has no installation candidate
2008-10-29T01:54:00.000Z	ikonia	ubun2	can you show me the bug report that says re-install at

2008-10-29T01:55:00.000Z	ubun2	ikonia	so I removed it, then tried to reinstall, but I get that error
2008-10-29T01:56:00.000Z	ikonia	ubun2	what command do you use to remove it
2008-10-29T01:56:00.000Z	ubun2	ikonia	apt-get remove at
2008-10-29T01:58:00.000Z	ikonia	ubun2	try installing anacron and cron packages
2008-10-29T01:58:00.000Z	ikonia	ubun2	the package is called "at"
2008-10-29T01:58:00.000Z	ikonia	ubun2	I've just found it in the repo
2008-10-29T01:59:00.000Z	ubun2	ikonia	yes, but when I try to install it "apt-get install at" I get the error: Package at is not available, but is referred to by another package.
2008-10-29T01:59:00.000Z	ikonia	ubun2	what version of ubuntu are you using
2008-10-29T02:00:00.000Z	ubun2	ikonia	8.04.1
2008-10-29T02:00:00.000Z	ikonia	ubun2	sudo apt-get update first
2008-10-29T02:00:00.000Z	ubun2	ikonia	did that
2008-10-29T02:01:00.000Z	ikonia	ubun2	I can't explain it as I can see the package fine
2008-10-29T02:02:00.000Z	ubun2	ikonia	maybe I'm missing the repo in my sources.list?
2008-10-29T02:02:00.000Z	ubun2	ikonia	can you tell me what repo it should be in?
2008-10-29T02:19:00.000Z	ubun2	ikonia	can I find a http link to a .deb for 'at' somehow?
