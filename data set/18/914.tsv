2012-04-21T20:28:00.000Z	anddam		any hint about the wifi password thing?
2012-04-21T20:29:00.000Z	auronandace	anddam	isn't wpa_supplicant used no matter what desktop environment you're on?
2012-04-21T20:29:00.000Z	anddam	auronandace	idk, last time I used wifi in linux I was on WEP
2012-04-21T20:30:00.000Z	auronandace	anddam	if i were you i'd change to wpa
2012-04-21T20:31:00.000Z	anddam	auronandace	I know, that network doesn't exists anymore since it was several years ago
2012-04-21T20:31:00.000Z	auronandace	anddam	good
2012-04-21T20:32:00.000Z	anddam	auronandace	the point is I'm not used to ubuntu and I'd like to avoid typing password each time this user (non admin) logs on this 11.10
2012-04-21T20:32:00.000Z	anddam	auronandace	I'm going to search wpa_supplicant for starter
2012-04-21T20:33:00.000Z	auronandace	anddam	sounds like a keyring issue to me
2012-04-21T20:37:00.000Z	auronandace	anddam	networkmanager is default
2012-04-21T20:39:00.000Z	anddam	auronandace	that doesn't answer how to check if I'm using it, tho'
2012-04-21T20:40:00.000Z	auronandace	anddam	the logic is if you didn't change the network manager you are using then you're likely using the one that is default
2012-04-21T20:47:00.000Z	auronandace	anddam	i think lxde uses networkmanager by default too
2012-04-21T21:09:00.000Z	auronandace	anddam	in the manpages to wpa_supplicant
2012-08-25T17:16:00.000Z	anddam	auronandace	I'm not sure how that's helpful
2012-08-25T17:16:00.000Z	anddam	auronandace	I don't have downloaded packages
2012-08-25T17:17:00.000Z	auronandace	anddam	sorry, wrong factoid
