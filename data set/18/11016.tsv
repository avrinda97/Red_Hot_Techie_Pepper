2008-07-29T17:19:00.000Z	seanh		Can anyone advise me on how to install a hardware accelerated graphics driver for intel? My graphics card is (according to lshw): Mobile 945GM/GMS, 943/940GML Express Integrated Graphics Controller
2008-07-29T17:20:00.000Z	wols_	seanh	ubuntu comes with all needeed drivers by default
2008-07-29T17:21:00.000Z	wols_	seanh	nowhere. you already have all the drives
2008-07-29T17:21:00.000Z	seanh	wols_	the hardware accelerated driver is not enabled though
2008-07-29T17:21:00.000Z	wols_	seanh	glxinfo
2008-07-29T17:22:00.000Z	seanh	wols_	I don't have a program by that name and don't find it in the package manager
2008-07-29T17:22:00.000Z	wols_	seanh	what ubuntu version?
2008-07-29T17:22:00.000Z	seanh	wols_	8.04
2008-07-29T17:22:00.000Z	wols_	seanh	then you have it
2008-07-29T17:23:00.000Z	wols_	seanh	or your ubuntu is not properly installed
2008-07-29T17:24:00.000Z	wols_	seanh	dpkg -l |grep mesa
2008-07-29T17:25:00.000Z	seanh	wols_	it finds libgl1-mesa-glx and libglu1-mesa and says ii next to both of them
2008-07-29T17:25:00.000Z	wols_	seanh	dpkg -l libc6 | tail -1
2008-07-29T17:25:00.000Z	seanh	wols_	find libc6 ii
2008-07-29T17:27:00.000Z	seanh	wols_	http://pastebin.com/d4a63c690
2008-07-29T17:29:00.000Z	seanh	wols_	I believe I should be using "the xorg intel driver", the package is installed but I don't see anything about a driver called "intel" in my xorg.conf
2008-07-29T17:29:00.000Z	wols_	seanh	there won't be
2008-07-29T17:31:00.000Z	seanh	wols_	it seems the be using the mesa driver instead of the intel one, but what is the correct way to change the driver?
