2009-11-24T23:39:00.000Z	mataks		i can't copy and paste text from my ubuntu to a remote computer..  i tried in my windows vista i can copy and paste text from my local pc to remote desktop... help pls
2009-11-24T23:40:00.000Z	Slart	mataks	that would depend on what application you use for the remote connection.. some implement clipboard sharing and such.. others dont
2009-11-24T23:43:00.000Z	mataks	Slart	im connecting a remote desktop from logmein.com which has clipboard sharing.. but i can't copy paste a text from my ubuntu to the remote deskotp from logmein.. why is that.. but if i use windowsVista copy and paste work
2009-11-24T23:43:00.000Z	Slart	mataks	I have no idea what logmein.com is or what kind of software it uses
2010-05-15T03:13:00.000Z	Slart	mataks	sounds like a good plan.. hopefully nouveau will make plymouth looks sharp and nice
2010-05-15T03:03:00.000Z	Slart	mataks	probably the new splash screen thingy.. plymouth or whatever it's called
2010-05-15T03:03:00.000Z	mataks	Slart	do you know how to fix this?
2010-05-15T03:05:00.000Z	Slart	mataks	hmm.. not really.. it might be a graphics driver issue.. what kind of graphics card are you using?
2010-05-15T03:05:00.000Z	mataks	Slart	 -nVidia Corporation G73 [GeForce 7300 GT]
2010-05-15T03:06:00.000Z	Slart	mataks	are you using the binary nvidia driver?
2010-05-15T03:08:00.000Z	mataks	Slart	 im using the Nvidia accelerated graphics driver which is found in Administrator >> Hardware Drivers   ... it was fine before i upgraded to lucid.
2010-05-15T03:09:00.000Z	Slart	mataks	mm.. I think plymouth is using something called kernel modesetting.. (I'm not entirely sure what that is).. but I don't think that works with the binary nvidia driver.. that's probably why you're having issues with it.. if you do a fresh install of lucid it will use nouveau which is another nvidia driver that supports kernel mode setting
2010-05-15T03:10:00.000Z	Slart	mataks	on my system, I've got a 8800gtx, my splash screen is low resolution and not very nice looking.. but it's not around for long so I don't really lose any sleep over it
2010-05-15T03:10:00.000Z	Slart	mataks	I can imagine that other nvidia cards might experience different issues when plymouth tries to do it's thing..
2010-05-15T03:11:00.000Z	mataks	Slart	 can i just use Nouveau instead ?
2010-05-15T03:11:00.000Z	Slart	mataks	sure.. you'll lose some 3d acceleration though.. but give it a try
2010-05-15T03:12:00.000Z	Slart	mataks	I think just uninstalling the binary nvidia driver will make it go back to the nouveau driver
2010-05-15T03:12:00.000Z	mataks	Slart	 ok i'll try if it fix my problem. if not.. just install back the nvidia driver :)
