2012-03-19T21:24:00.000Z	jsmith-argotec		This might not be the appropriate channel for this question but I'm not sure where to begin
2012-03-19T21:24:00.000Z	ikonia	jsmith-argotec	this channel is for ubuntu support
2012-03-19T21:25:00.000Z	jsmith-argotec	ikonia	well I am running on 10.04 - I'll explain briefly and maybe you can help guide me :-)
2012-03-19T21:26:00.000Z	jsmith-argotec	ikonia	I have a program that calls 'uname -n' and I need to figure out how to intercept the call and run a different command
2012-03-19T21:26:00.000Z	ikonia	jsmith-argotec	as in, instead of calling uname -n it does something else
2012-03-19T21:27:00.000Z	jsmith-argotec	ikonia	as in it does call uname -n but I'm trying to run it in a cluster so I want it use something like host x.x.x.x
2012-03-19T21:27:00.000Z	jsmith-argotec	ikonia	it's a binary so I can't just change the command like in an init script
2012-03-19T21:28:00.000Z	ikonia	jsmith-argotec	then I would suggest not doing it
2012-03-19T21:28:00.000Z	ikonia	jsmith-argotec	changing binaries is just a no go unless you have the source
2012-03-19T21:29:00.000Z	jsmith-argotec	ikonia	maybe not even close but could you wrap the program somehow and redirect it when it tries to call uname?
2012-03-19T21:29:00.000Z	ikonia	jsmith-argotec	me - I wouldn't uname is important, so trying to put a wrapper around it isn't something I'd suggest
2012-03-19T21:29:00.000Z	ikonia	jsmith-argotec	(being honest)
2012-03-19T21:30:00.000Z	jsmith-argotec	ikonia	no I wouldn't want to do that! figured it would break lots of things!
2012-03-19T21:30:00.000Z	jsmith-argotec	ikonia	wanted to know if I could wrap the binary that goes looking for uname (that I don't have source for)
2012-03-19T21:31:00.000Z	ikonia	jsmith-argotec	no, not really
2012-03-19T21:31:00.000Z	jsmith-argotec	ikonia	too bad :-(  thanks for the help though!
2012-03-19T21:32:00.000Z	ikonia	jsmith-argotec	apologies, just being honest for a solution
2012-03-19T21:33:00.000Z	jsmith-argotec	ikonia	not your fault - windows companies aren't very linux helpful!
