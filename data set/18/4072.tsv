2011-05-23T07:24:00.000Z	jetole	edbian	well email can be web i.e. gmail, yahoo, squirrel mail on your own server
2011-05-23T07:25:00.000Z	edbian	jetole	but in application level, email and web are two different things
2011-05-23T07:25:00.000Z	jetole	edbian	I know. I run many of both servers but I also run squirrel mail and I could use wget with that if I wanted to. I just don't know why anyone would want to
2011-05-23T07:26:00.000Z	edbian	jetole	I suppose you could!  Good point
2011-05-23T07:35:00.000Z	edbian	jetole	luchenbill you cannot su root   because there is no root account.  su without a username is su root
