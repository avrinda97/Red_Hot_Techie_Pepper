2007-07-09T15:20:00.000Z	CorpseFeeder		Let me rephrase that. I have Ubuntu Edgy 6.10 installed with Ubuntu Studio 7.04 installed afterwards... When I boot into 6.10 and look at /boot/grub/menu.lst it only shows the 6.10 menu items and none of the 7.04 items? So where are the missing menu entries hiding?
2007-07-09T15:21:00.000Z	CorpseFeeder		Also.. is there any way for me to see the 7.04 filesystem from within 6.10?
2007-07-09T15:21:00.000Z	lousygarua	CorpseFeeder	it's the same filesystem
2007-07-09T15:25:00.000Z	lousygarua	CorpseFeeder	is it on the same hard disk? partition? what is your 6.10/7.04 setup
2007-07-09T15:25:00.000Z	CorpseFeeder	lousygarua	they are installed on two different drives
2007-07-09T15:26:00.000Z	lousygarua	CorpseFeeder	on 6.10, did you mount the 7.04 drive?
2007-07-09T15:27:00.000Z	CorpseFeeder	lousygarua	it's visible on the desktop, but for some reason it just shows everything on the 6.10 hard drive
2007-07-09T15:28:00.000Z	lousygarua	CorpseFeeder	when u go to the mounted 7,04 drive, and go to your home folder, is it the same as your 6.10 folder?
2007-07-09T15:28:00.000Z	CorpseFeeder	lousygarua	yes.
2007-07-09T15:30:00.000Z	lousygarua	CorpseFeeder	maybe 7.04 installer is very smart and links the 7.04 home folder with the older home folder.
2007-07-09T15:31:00.000Z	lousygarua	CorpseFeeder	so you get easy transition between 6.10 and 7.04, but im' not sure
2007-07-09T15:33:00.000Z	lousygarua	CorpseFeeder	if you "ls" inside a folder if will draw symbolic links in cyan so you can check if the 7.04 home folder is actually a link to the old home folder
2007-07-09T15:34:00.000Z	CorpseFeeder	lousygarua	I don't know... but the problem I have is quite stupid - I know my password for my 7.04 partition, but I've forgotten the username since I have not booted into 7.04 for several months - I was hoping if I could see the home folder of 7.04 from 6.10 then I would be able to see the username from the 7.04 home folder.
2007-07-09T15:34:00.000Z	lousygarua	CorpseFeeder	you can boot the 7.04 in safe mode adn reset your passworrd
2007-07-09T15:35:00.000Z	lousygarua	CorpseFeeder	you just choose the safe mode on grub, and it gets you to a root prompt
2007-07-09T15:36:00.000Z	CorpseFeeder	lousygarua	ok.. I didn't know that. I give that a go..
2007-07-09T15:45:00.000Z	CorpseFeeder	lousygarua	Thanks for that.. I didn't need to change password or anything... I was able to see the 7.04 home directory from the recovery mode root command line and therefore remember the username to log in ;)
2007-07-09T15:45:00.000Z	lousygarua	CorpseFeeder	glad to help :)
