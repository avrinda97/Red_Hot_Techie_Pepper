2007-04-02T11:02:00.000Z	digits		Any ideas on how to shutdown the computer when X is closed? Trying to make a thin foolproof install for my father, and when he exits X i want the computer to do a "shutdown -h now" automagically (i'm using pekwm)
2007-04-02T11:04:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	digits	sudo shutdown -h now
2007-04-02T11:04:00.000Z	digits	HymnToLife	Yeah, and preferrably without any user interaction
2007-04-02T11:04:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	digits	pull the plug?
2007-04-02T11:05:00.000Z	digits		[WaZ] : hehe
2007-04-02T11:05:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	digits	what problem are you trying to solve?
2007-04-02T11:06:00.000Z	digits		[WaZ] : I'm trying to make a foolproof surfstation for my father, it's on an ancient computer - thus gnome is out of the picture
2007-04-02T11:06:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	digits	gotcha
2007-04-02T11:06:00.000Z	digits		[WaZ] : This far I'm running pekwm for him wich autoload firefox on start (and i'm also using mingetty to autologin and start x for him on boot)
2007-04-02T11:07:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	digits	you could use gdm without gnome
2007-04-02T11:07:00.000Z	digits		[WaZ] : Now I want the computer to halt when he exits X, without and user interaction
2007-04-02T11:07:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	digits	and set up Windowmaker or something
2007-04-02T11:09:00.000Z	digits		[WaZ] : yeah, if feels overkill to install 30megs of apps for an auto-shutdown...
2007-04-02T11:09:00.000Z	digits		[WaZ] : is it possible to "stack" commands in xinitrc or something?
2007-04-02T11:09:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	digits	true
2007-04-02T11:10:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	digits	I have never tried
2007-04-02T11:10:00.000Z	digits		[WaZ] : well, gonna have a beer and be a tad social with the folk... then on with the carnage ;P
2007-04-02T11:10:00.000Z	[WaZ] 	digits	lol have fun
