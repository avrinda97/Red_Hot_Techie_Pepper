2006-06-07T14:55:00.000Z	noobuntu		I appologise if someone answered me and I missed it...  I'm having trouble with glxgears on Ubuntu 6.06 on AMD64.  I get the error:" X Error of failed request:  BadAlloc (insufficient resources for operation)"
2006-06-07T14:56:00.000Z	noobuntu		It's a 32mb Radeon 7200, and I have a gig of of RAM.
2006-06-07T14:57:00.000Z	noobuntu		Yeah, TWM is the ugliest VM available, but it's low requirements. :)  The next one up would be blackbox, IMO.
2006-06-07T14:58:00.000Z	noobuntu		that too
2006-06-07T14:59:00.000Z	noobuntu		Cute car, but I can't read german. ^_^
2006-06-07T15:00:00.000Z	noobuntu		My ATI display is fast enough, but my OopenGL is screwed.
2006-06-07T15:01:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	noobuntu	does fglrx appear in the output of lsmod | grep fglrx
2006-06-07T15:01:00.000Z	noobuntu	h3sp4wn	No it doesn't.
2006-06-07T15:02:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	noobuntu	Are you using fglrx ?
2006-06-07T15:02:00.000Z	noobuntu	h3sp4wn	I'm not using the ATI drivers cause my card is too old.
2006-06-07T15:02:00.000Z	noobuntu	h3sp4wn	it's only a 7200
2006-06-07T15:03:00.000Z	noobuntu	h3sp4wn	It looks like I'm using the xorg radeon driver.
2006-06-07T15:04:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	noobuntu	try sudo modprobe radeon (if it does not complain add radeon to the bottom of /etc/modules
2006-06-07T15:04:00.000Z	noobuntu	h3sp4wn	Ok, one sec.  But I think it's already loaded.
2006-06-07T15:05:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	noobuntu	If it is already loaded I don't know what to suggest sorry
2006-06-07T15:05:00.000Z	noobuntu	h3sp4wn	Thanks anyway.
2006-06-07T15:05:00.000Z	h3sp4wn	noobuntu	I don't have one of those cards
2006-06-07T15:09:00.000Z	noobuntu	h3sp4wn	It looks like the problem I have may be a bug.  Bug #45318:
