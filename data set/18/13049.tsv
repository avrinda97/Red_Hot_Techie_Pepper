2006-02-21T10:42:00.000Z	carpediem	adub	it's not that hard to get ndiswrapper set up (although I have no idea about *That* card)
2006-02-21T10:42:00.000Z	adub	carpediem	will ndis get monitor mode working
2006-02-21T10:43:00.000Z	carpediem	adub	I don't know with that card.  But if you have the .inf its a two minute process.
2006-02-21T10:43:00.000Z	adub	carpediem	sounds like the ticket then cause i have the infs
2006-02-21T10:44:00.000Z	carpediem	adub	sudo apt-get install ndiswrapper-utils
2006-02-21T10:44:00.000Z	adub	carpediem	now i have the card working fine in linux i just want monitor mode working but
2006-02-21T10:45:00.000Z	carpediem	adub	I have no idea, I've only done ndiswrapper when I had no other choice.
2006-02-21T10:45:00.000Z	adub	carpediem	 ok  i have it installed how do i set this up
2006-02-21T10:46:00.000Z	carpediem	adub	cd to the dir with your inf, and type "sudo iwconfig -i myInf.inf"
2006-02-21T10:47:00.000Z	adub	carpediem	my command to view ip is ifconfig i never use iwocnfig but i would on that command line for this ndiswrapper??
2006-02-21T10:48:00.000Z	carpediem	adub	you can...but I was talking to rewt_ about ndiswrapper too
2006-02-21T10:48:00.000Z	carpediem	adub	did you run the inf install command?
2006-02-21T10:50:00.000Z	carpediem	adub	add -R
2006-02-21T11:04:00.000Z	carpediem	adub	even as root
2006-02-21T11:04:00.000Z	carpediem	adub	 ?
2006-02-21T11:04:00.000Z	adub	carpediem	i can as root
2006-02-21T11:05:00.000Z	carpediem	adub	I don't have the exact info, but you need to get hotplug to mount it with user rw.  There are ways, but I don't remember how.
