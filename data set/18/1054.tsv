2012-10-28T17:30:00.000Z	dr_willis	Dragonster82	 possible fix -> Set the sound settings the way you would like to have them when you boot. Then, run the following command.        sudo alsactl store
2012-10-28T17:30:00.000Z	Dragonster82	dr_willis	I will bear that in mind, I shall reboot now.
2012-10-28T17:36:00.000Z	dr_willis	Dragonster82	 i dont find it unstable at all.
2012-10-28T17:37:00.000Z	dr_willis	Dragonster82	 compared to the fighting i do with windows machines on a daily basis..
2012-10-28T17:37:00.000Z	Dragonster82	dr_willis	Ubuntu seems to do the job for me, but when it comes to simple thing like storing settings, its terrible.
2012-10-28T17:38:00.000Z	dr_willis	Dragonster82	 never really had any issues..  what if your windows box had the same issue? where would you even begin to find the fix? dive into the system reguestry and hope you figure out what setting is somehow related?
2012-10-28T17:39:00.000Z	Dragonster82	dr_willis	In windows I never had any issues with sounds etc. The only problem I had was viruses. I came to ubuntu because of its low rate of getting viruses and its simplicity.
2012-10-28T17:40:00.000Z	dr_willis	Dragonster82	 mostlikely what happened is you somehow ran a sound app as root that saved the sound leveles as root. so when the system rebooted it used roots settings.
2012-10-28T17:41:00.000Z	Dragonster82	dr_willis	Well I have no idea about that.
2012-10-28T17:42:00.000Z	dr_willis	Dragonster82	 see people do stuff like that all the time in here.  just rember to use gksudo and sudo only when needed. and 'gksudo' for gui apps.  if thats what happened.
2012-10-28T17:42:00.000Z	Dragonster82	dr_willis	I didn't have to use sudo on alsamixer for it to do the job for me, but oh well.
2012-10-28T17:43:00.000Z	dr_willis	Dragonster82	 alsamixer set a config file for the user thats used at login. so if you try a differnt user the issue may come back.
