2006-10-25T12:40:00.000Z	CarinArr	gh0st	you're trying to run a java program that doesn't have a main method
2006-10-25T12:40:00.000Z	CarinArr	gh0st	you could be trying to run it using the wrong class
2006-10-25T12:41:00.000Z	gh0st	CarinArr	what can i do?
2006-10-25T12:41:00.000Z	CarinArr	gh0st	is this your code or someone elses code?
2006-10-25T12:41:00.000Z	gh0st	CarinArr	someone else's (univ)
2006-10-25T12:42:00.000Z	CarinArr	gh0st	s it a collection of classes or is it a jar file
2006-10-25T12:42:00.000Z	CarinArr		er lol
2006-10-25T12:42:00.000Z	CarinArr		ah
2006-10-25T12:42:00.000Z	CarinArr		then yeah. show him the code, cause then it's probably just a typo;)
2006-10-25T12:43:00.000Z	gh0st	CarinArr	i had to make a HelloWorld.java with following code: http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/28295/ then compile it with javac HelloWorld.java
2006-10-25T12:43:00.000Z	gh0st	CarinArr	then run "java HelloWorld"
2006-10-25T12:43:00.000Z	CarinArr	gh0st	you don't have a main method, every program needs at least one main method
2006-10-25T12:43:00.000Z	gh0st	CarinArr	sorry i don't understand?
2006-10-25T12:44:00.000Z	CarinArr	gh0st	that will compile, but it won't run.. are you sure there isn't a further step to whatever tutorial you're following/
2006-10-25T12:45:00.000Z	CarinArr		anyhow.. dinner bbiab
2006-10-25T12:45:00.000Z	gh0st		there's step like editing: the /etc/profile, what's that exactly?
2006-10-25T12:46:00.000Z	gh0st	CarinArr	dabaR: there's step like editing: the /etc/profile, what's that exactly?
