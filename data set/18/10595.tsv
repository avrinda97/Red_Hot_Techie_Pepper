2007-09-05T13:19:00.000Z	b33r-	nickrud	I thought u were leaving ;p
2007-09-05T13:24:00.000Z	b33r-	nickrud	is it normal to use 135MB of swap and only 84 of my RAM?
2007-09-05T13:25:00.000Z	nickrud	b33r-	it's probably using the rest of your ram as cache, try looking at it with htop (you may need to install it)
2007-09-05T13:27:00.000Z	b33r-	nickrud	it shows the same in htop
2007-09-05T13:28:00.000Z	nickrud	b33r-	no other colors in the bar? To be honest, I've never really understood the caching and swapping that the kernel does. It's one of those things I just take on faith
2007-09-15T11:12:00.000Z	b33r-	nickrud	remember when you helped me installing sun java update2?
2007-09-15T11:12:00.000Z	nickrud	b33r-	sure, still futzing sorta with the wiki page
2007-09-15T11:12:00.000Z	b33r-	nickrud	is there a way to make it work on firefox x64? :/
2007-09-15T11:15:00.000Z	nickrud	b33r-	yes, I used https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AMD64/FirefoxAndPlugins when I ran it
2007-09-15T11:19:00.000Z	b33r-	nickrud	when I do sudo ln -s /usr/lib/jvm/ia32-java-6-sun/jre/plugin/i386/ns7/libjavaplugin_oji.so /usr/local/firefox32/plugins/
2007-09-15T11:21:00.000Z	nickrud	b33r-	I wouldn't think so, but I no longer have an x64 install to check against
