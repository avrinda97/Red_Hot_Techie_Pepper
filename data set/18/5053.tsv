2010-04-01T11:52:00.000Z	sikun	Flannel	i have used /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
2010-04-01T11:53:00.000Z	Flannel	sikun	what are you trying to set up configuration-wise?
2010-04-01T11:54:00.000Z	Flannel	sikun	What are you trying to set up with apache and/or what's your problem?
2010-04-01T11:56:00.000Z	Flannel	sikun	does it have to be as cgi? or would mod_python work just fine? (it'll be faster too)
2010-04-01T11:56:00.000Z	sikun	Flannel	hmm.. yeah that would work as well actually
2010-04-01T11:57:00.000Z	Flannel	sikun	Alright, what have you done so far as far as installing python in apache and stuff?
2010-04-01T11:57:00.000Z	Flannel	sikun	Have you done anything with python yet? (change apache configs or installed anything)
2010-04-01T11:59:00.000Z	Flannel	sikun	Alright, go ahead and go in and remove that, and then we'll get started :)
2010-04-01T12:00:00.000Z	sikun	Flannel	Alright, everything i've changed is removed
2010-04-01T12:02:00.000Z	Flannel	sikun	Alright, now `sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-python`
2010-04-01T12:04:00.000Z	sikun	Flannel	ok, its installed
2010-04-01T12:05:00.000Z	Flannel	sikun	Alright, now verify that there's python stuff in /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/ (probably mod_python.load and mod_python.conf), `ls -l /etc/apache2/mods-enabled | grep python` is one way to do it
2010-04-01T12:08:00.000Z	sikun	Flannel	ok mods-available/python.load
2010-04-01T12:09:00.000Z	Flannel	sikun	Alright, then `sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 force-reload` and you're set
2010-04-01T12:10:00.000Z	sikun	Flannel	ok, when i attempt to load my first test.py file.. it attempts to download it.. so i need to add AddHandler? i can't remember the exact wording of it.. but correct?
2010-04-01T12:12:00.000Z	Flannel	sikun	Yeah, the package should take care of that, is there no python.conf file?  check in /etc/apache2/mods-available/
2010-04-01T12:14:00.000Z	sikun	Flannel	yeah, no python.conf file :/
2010-04-01T12:17:00.000Z	Flannel	sikun	Alright, looks like we'll need to either make one (thats usually where addhandlers go) or you can put it in your virtualhost if you only want to add it to one domain
