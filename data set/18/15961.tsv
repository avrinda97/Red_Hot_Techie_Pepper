2004-12-15T11:49:00.000Z	Jelte		trying to build expocity i get "No package 'gtk+-2.0' found"   it mentions i might need to add it to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH... is that an unbuntu thing? is it in a non-standard location?
2004-12-15T11:50:00.000Z	linux_mafia	Jelte	dont bother with it, use skippy instead
2004-12-15T11:50:00.000Z	Jelte	linux_mafia	instead of expocity you mean?
2004-12-15T11:50:00.000Z	linux_mafia	Jelte	yes
2004-12-15T11:50:00.000Z	Jelte	linux_mafia	url?  any specific reason for it being better?
2004-12-15T11:51:00.000Z	linux_mafia	Jelte	expocity is a patch to metacity, potentially destabilising your wm, etc skippy is just an app, that imho works better anyway
2004-12-15T11:52:00.000Z	Jelte	linux_mafia	excellent.. i'll give it a go ;-)
2004-12-15T11:53:00.000Z	linux_mafia	Jelte	if you google theres a deb of it somewhere, its not in ubuntu
2004-12-15T11:53:00.000Z	Jelte	linux_mafia	googling as we speak ;-)
2004-12-15T11:57:00.000Z	Jelte	linux_mafia	ah works... but is rather slow to grab the windows ;-(    (especially first time cycling through the lot)
2004-12-15T11:58:00.000Z	linux_mafia	Jelte	yep
2004-12-15T11:59:00.000Z	Jelte	linux_mafia	think i'll stick to alt-tab instead ;-)
2004-12-15T11:59:00.000Z	linux_mafia	Jelte	i did
2004-12-15T12:00:00.000Z	Jelte	linux_mafia	wouldn't it be great if alt-tab did a smooth fade-out of current window to smooth fade-in of new one, and cycle through the list like that? ;-)
2004-12-15T12:02:00.000Z	linux_mafia	Jelte	i guess so, just eye candy though, i enabled xorg composite, drop shadows and transparency the other day, only for like 10 minutes though, it was nice, but kinda pointless, and just uses more resources
2004-12-15T12:03:00.000Z	Jelte	linux_mafia	well yeah i dont much fancy pointless eyecandy, but the problem i have with alt-tab is that i have soo many apps open that that little window with icons doesn't tell me enough... i'd like a better visual representation of what window is what
2004-12-15T12:05:00.000Z	linux_mafia	Jelte	i generally have a few virtual desktops, and then i have mail open on one, browser on another, etc
2004-12-15T12:05:00.000Z	Jelte	linux_mafia	tried that, but for whatever reason i always end up having 99 apps in one desktop and only 1 in all the others ;-)
