2007-07-22T13:42:00.000Z	Enselic	bruenig	what is the pro?
2007-07-22T13:43:00.000Z	bruenig	Enselic	if your system breaks, your files are still there mainly
2007-07-22T13:43:00.000Z	bruenig	Enselic	if you need to reinstall later because of breakage, all your settings and files are still in place, so you don't have to go through reconfiguring everything
2007-07-22T13:43:00.000Z	Enselic	bruenig	isn't that true anyway? unless it's a harddisk crash, and /home is on another harddisk
2007-07-22T13:44:00.000Z	Enselic	bruenig	hmm, ya
2007-07-22T13:44:00.000Z	bruenig	Enselic	there are some exploits which it will circumvent such as the dd if=/dev/null of=/dev/hda1
2008-01-12T20:57:00.000Z	bruenig	Enselic	need to mount them
2008-01-12T20:57:00.000Z	Enselic	bruenig	without mounting, it's not possible?
2008-01-12T20:57:00.000Z	bruenig	Enselic	I don't think so
2008-01-12T20:58:00.000Z	bruenig	Enselic	just mount it
2008-01-12T20:58:00.000Z	Enselic	bruenig	thats to complicated for a mother
2008-01-12T21:04:00.000Z	bruenig	Enselic	mount the iso
2008-01-12T21:05:00.000Z	Enselic	bruenig	as I told you that is not an option
2008-01-12T21:05:00.000Z	Enselic	bruenig	thanks anyway
2008-01-12T21:05:00.000Z	bruenig	Enselic	that is the only thing you got, if playing the iso doesn't work, and you refuse to mount, then install windows or something
2008-01-12T21:06:00.000Z	Enselic	bruenig	or I could simply try to fix VLC
2008-01-12T21:08:00.000Z	Enselic	bruenig	shees dude calm down
