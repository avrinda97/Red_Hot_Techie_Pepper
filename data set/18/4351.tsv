2009-07-21T17:17:00.000Z	Fazer2		hey, whenever I modify a file, another hidden file is created with the same name and "~" suffix - what is that?
2009-07-21T17:17:00.000Z	indus	Fazer2	safety
2009-07-21T17:17:00.000Z	indus	Fazer2	actually its a backup of that file
2009-07-21T17:18:00.000Z	Fazer2	indus	how can I disable that?
2009-07-21T17:18:00.000Z	Fazer2	indus	I need space on the hard drive; how will I be able to use that backup anyway?
2009-07-21T17:19:00.000Z	indus	Fazer2	its in bytes
2009-07-21T17:19:00.000Z	indus	Fazer2	wont create any spave
2009-07-21T17:20:00.000Z	Fazer2	indus	I modified .bashrc, the original takes 3 KB, the backup takes also 3 KB
2009-07-21T17:20:00.000Z	indus	Fazer2	and?
2009-07-21T17:20:00.000Z	indus	Fazer2	but anyways, i dont think i know and dont think this is a good idea at all
2009-07-21T17:20:00.000Z	indus	Fazer2	what are you trying to do?
2009-07-21T17:21:00.000Z	indus	Fazer2	3 kb is nothing at all
2009-07-21T17:21:00.000Z	Fazer2	indus	yes, but the same happens for every other file, so it takes twice as much space as it should
2009-07-21T17:21:00.000Z	indus	Fazer2	but its still negligible
2009-07-21T17:21:00.000Z	Fazer2	indus	I want to understand why it's working like that and how can I profit from it or disable that behavior
2009-07-21T17:22:00.000Z	indus	Fazer2	its not for all files, mostlyfor system files or applications which implement that behaviour
2009-07-21T17:22:00.000Z	indus	Fazer2	for example a config file in a game might auto create a backup
2009-07-21T17:23:00.000Z	indus	Fazer2	all such backup fils combined wont cross 100 kb onyour system
