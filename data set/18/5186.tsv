2010-06-05T11:58:00.000Z	purvesh		i want to resize my image exact Pixels any Software for that in Ubuntu ?
2010-06-05T11:58:00.000Z	SwedeMike	purvesh	gimp is a good image editor.
2010-06-05T11:59:00.000Z	purvesh	SwedeMike	hey but it will not resize exact pixels
2010-06-05T11:59:00.000Z	SwedeMike	purvesh	no? It resizes by pixel count when I last tried anyway.
2010-06-05T12:00:00.000Z	purvesh	SwedeMike	u can try now i had tried
2010-06-05T12:00:00.000Z	SwedeMike	purvesh	I tried yesterday and it could resize by pixel count then anyway. It could do that all the times I tried the past 5 years as well.
2010-06-05T12:01:00.000Z	purvesh	SwedeMike	i had said it resize by pixel but i want exact pixel like 192 x 192 that it cant......! :)
2010-06-05T12:02:00.000Z	SwedeMike	purvesh	I don't see why not, or you don't actually mean "resize" and mean something else.
2010-06-05T12:03:00.000Z	purvesh	SwedeMike	its k bro......! but i had used word exact ... anyways .. Thanx bro for info. i ll take care of my words
2010-06-05T12:06:00.000Z	SwedeMike	purvesh	I just scaled an image to 192x192 pixels in gimp.
2010-06-05T12:07:00.000Z	purvesh	SwedeMike	k .... but what is the Procedure can u tell me .....!
2010-06-05T12:07:00.000Z	SwedeMike	purvesh	imagemagick can do it from the command line.
2010-06-05T12:08:00.000Z	SwedeMike	purvesh	you go to image->scale image, then you enter the amount of pixels you want there, and press scale (undo the "chain" if you dont want to keep aspect ratio)
2010-06-05T12:08:00.000Z	purvesh	SwedeMike	so for installing imagemagick i have to type any cmd..
2010-06-05T12:11:00.000Z	purvesh	SwedeMike	Hey Thanx for that Chain.. lol .. Finally done .
2010-06-05T12:13:00.000Z	SwedeMike	purvesh	just a tip for you, you really should work on your "asking questions" skill, if it was the aspect ratio you didn't succeed in not keeping, saying so would have cut this conversation down by a lot.
2010-06-05T12:13:00.000Z	SwedeMike	purvesh	saying "it won't resize to 192x192 but instead I can only choose one figure and it calculates the other" would also have worked.
2010-06-05T12:15:00.000Z	purvesh	SwedeMike	see m bit noob may be .... but every one Starts from there so shortly i ll reach at some level
