2011-08-21T06:19:00.000Z	MagicJ		I have  new install of 10.4 and when I chose a screen saver they are all just black/blank - what am I missing
2011-08-21T06:19:00.000Z	zykotick9	MagicJ	are you trying opengl ones, or do all of the screen savers fail?
2011-08-21T06:21:00.000Z	MagicJ	zykotick9	I am trying the ones that show on the System/APreferences/Screensaves
2011-08-21T06:22:00.000Z	zykotick9	MagicJ	and NONE of them work?
2011-08-21T06:22:00.000Z	MagicJ		everyone thatI have selected just shows black/blank
2011-08-21T06:22:00.000Z	MagicJ	zykotick9	all that I have tries ar just black/blank
2011-08-21T06:23:00.000Z	zykotick9	MagicJ	sorry I have no idea, good luck.
2011-08-21T06:24:00.000Z	MagicJ	zykotick9	just tries some other - fuzzyflakes for example does work
2011-08-21T06:24:00.000Z	zykotick9	MagicJ	what graphics card are you using?
2011-08-21T06:26:00.000Z	MagicJ	zykotick9	this is a gateway netbook - so whatever that is - but do you think that it may be that I have an encrypted home directory
2011-08-21T06:26:00.000Z	MagicJ	zykotick9	this is the one difference between this system and all the other ubuntu setups I have
2011-08-21T06:26:00.000Z	zykotick9	MagicJ	in that case I can't help.  Encyrpted drives means I avoid the issue.  Good luck.  FYI to find your video card "lspci | grep -i vga" in a terminal.
2011-08-21T06:27:00.000Z	MagicJ		I have a gateway netbook - it has an internal microphone - what do I need to do to make ubuntu see it
2011-08-21T06:28:00.000Z	MagicJ	zykotick9	I have always handled encrypted systems by running the whole thing encrypted and I will return to that method it is better
2011-08-21T06:29:00.000Z	zykotick9	MagicJ	i personally just think encrypted filesystems are a bad idea.  Good luck though.
2011-08-21T06:36:00.000Z	MagicJ	zykotick9	y do u not like encrypted file systems?
2011-08-21T06:37:00.000Z	zykotick9	MagicJ	see mbrigdan's question above - it just doesn't make sence to me for home use (business use is a different matter)
2011-08-21T06:38:00.000Z	MagicJ	zykotick9	I am basically a biz user - but I would even say for home use I like it - I remember watching a dumpster diver collecting the discarded drives outside a best buy - I would bet he was after the data
