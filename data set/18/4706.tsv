2011-02-04T20:12:00.000Z	Bushman		ok, the guy lied to me. it has no linux support. why does it work?
2011-02-04T20:12:00.000Z	Bushman		and why does it crashes in random moments
2011-02-04T20:13:00.000Z	Bushman		i told you alredy, the don't know. the guy on the phone says he does not know
2011-02-04T20:15:00.000Z	sacarlson	Bushman	look like they supported that for some time https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BluetoothSetup
2011-02-09T16:22:00.000Z	sacarlson	Bushman	I've shutdown 2.0 hub usb before but been some time, I would have to look it up
2011-02-09T16:23:00.000Z	Bushman	sacarlson	i'd apriciate if you could find how to do this. i'd test it on 1.0 then and see if it's related
2011-02-09T16:27:00.000Z	sacarlson	Bushman	been so long I had problem finding what might work: sudo  modprobe -r ehci_hcd
2011-02-09T16:32:00.000Z	sacarlson	Bushman	sudo  modprobe -r ehci_hcd ; should disable usb 2.0 and put things to usb 1.0 mode, last I used it was back around ubuntu 7.10,  if it works in test you might have to find a way to setup at boot time
2011-02-09T16:35:00.000Z	Bushman	sacarlson	no can doo: FATAL: Module ehci_hcd is builtin
2011-02-09T17:01:00.000Z	Bushman	sacarlson	modprobe says: FATAL: Module ehci_hcd is builtin
2011-02-09T17:01:00.000Z	Bushman	sacarlson	what now? :P
2011-02-09T17:02:00.000Z	sacarlson	Bushman	I don't know recompile the kernel so it's not built in?
2011-02-09T17:03:00.000Z	Bushman	sacarlson	that's out of an option. re-compiling stuff usualy ends badly in my case so i won't push my luck
2011-02-09T17:04:00.000Z	sacarlson	Bushman	building a kernel is not that big a task you create a custom deb file that you install and can move back to your old kernel if it fails
2011-02-09T17:05:00.000Z	Bushman	sacarlson	ok, i'll leave that as an option for later
2011-02-09T17:06:00.000Z	sacarlson	Bushman	but I'm sure it's may not be an easy action for some noobs
2011-02-09T17:07:00.000Z	sacarlson	Bushman	other option is find an older or newer kernel that's already built that has it not built in
