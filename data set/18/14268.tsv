2005-08-28T14:10:00.000Z	mihai		i just mounted a ntfs partition as root, what do i need to do so my user can read it ?
2005-08-28T14:10:00.000Z	EasterSunshine	mihai	pass -o ro,umask=022 to it
2005-08-28T14:11:00.000Z	EasterSunshine	mihai	and if that still does do it, add in a uid=1000,gid=1000 where uid and gid are your uid and gid
2005-08-28T14:12:00.000Z	mihai	EasterSunshine	mount /dev/hda5 /mnt/e -o ro,umask=022 doesn't work
2005-08-28T14:13:00.000Z	mihai	EasterSunshine	it's not correct syntax
2005-08-28T14:13:00.000Z	EasterSunshine	mihai	you left out -t ntfs
2005-08-28T14:13:00.000Z	EasterSunshine	mihai	but still that shouldn't make it wrong syntax...
2005-08-28T14:14:00.000Z	EasterSunshine	mihai	this is what i have in my mtab for an ntfs: /dev/hda1 /mnt/Ridley ntfs ro,umask=0222,uid=1000,gid=1000 0 0
2005-08-28T14:15:00.000Z	mihai	EasterSunshine	well i don't want a fstab solution, because i'll have to reboot, i don't want reboot
2005-08-28T14:17:00.000Z	EasterSunshine	mihai	i think it takes more ram if you have it
2005-08-28T14:17:00.000Z	EasterSunshine	mihai	otherwise, it'll drop it in the swap
2005-08-28T14:19:00.000Z	mihai	EasterSunshine	have what ?
2005-08-28T14:21:00.000Z	EasterSunshine	mihai	the more ram you have, the more it will be willing to take up
2005-08-28T14:21:00.000Z	EasterSunshine	mihai	its an attempt to be faster
2005-08-29T16:57:00.000Z	EasterSunshine	mihai	but there is a codec for divx somewhere in the repos
2005-08-29T07:29:00.000Z	EasterSunshine	mihai	you can do in and downoad the package manually
2005-08-29T07:29:00.000Z	EasterSunshine	mihai	and then use dkpg, or put it in a local repo
2005-08-29T07:31:00.000Z	mihai	EasterSunshine	well what if that package has a lot of dependencies ? will dpkg -i get them ?
