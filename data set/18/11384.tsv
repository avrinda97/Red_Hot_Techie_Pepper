2006-08-03T11:57:00.000Z	acojlo		is there something like defrag for linux?
2006-08-03T11:58:00.000Z	acojlo		I have problems with fetching updates from main repository - 3 of 46 updates could not be downloaded
2006-08-03T11:58:00.000Z	django_	acojlo	check out google on fsck one time
2006-08-03T11:58:00.000Z	django_	acojlo	that'll give you an idea
2006-08-03T11:59:00.000Z	django_	acojlo	yep, just don't run that puppy on a mounted fs
2006-08-03T12:01:00.000Z	django_	acojlo	yes, the xml parser could be re-written
2006-08-03T12:01:00.000Z	django_	acojlo	and i wish someone would soon
2006-08-03T12:01:00.000Z	acojlo	django_	so everyone is experiencing slow redraw?
2006-08-03T12:02:00.000Z	django_	acojlo	i uninstall gnome and immediatly install xfce4 because of slow redraw in gnome and kde
2006-08-03T12:03:00.000Z	acojlo	django_	my kde was fast, but I do not like kde. I like gnome much but this problem is bad
2006-08-03T12:03:00.000Z	django_	acojlo	sorry, can't help
2006-08-03T12:10:00.000Z	acojlo	django_	: you know what? It seems that cpufreq_conservative is all the time loaded on my system - so gnome must be slow :)
2006-08-03T12:10:00.000Z	django_	acojlo	heh, just when i hoped you would stop using gnome :)
2006-08-03T12:59:00.000Z	django_	acojlo	good now?
2006-08-03T13:00:00.000Z	acojlo	django_	yes, it's working reasonably fast - means I can not notice time lag with redrawing windows
2006-08-03T13:00:00.000Z	django_	acojlo	for fun one time apt-get install xubuntu-desktop and see if you notice much difference
2006-08-03T13:01:00.000Z	acojlo	django_	right now I do not know how to tell powernowd to use no cpufreq scaling while on AC power through /etc/default/powernowd, so I've unloaded p4_clockmod module and powernowd
2006-08-03T13:01:00.000Z	django_	acojlo	that'll work ;)
