2005-03-01T07:07:00.000Z	Vjaz	ron_	quit repeating your question for starters
2005-03-01T07:08:00.000Z	Vjaz	ron_	On the top of your screen you have "Computer" (I think, I'm using Ubuntu in Finnish).
2005-03-01T07:08:00.000Z	Vjaz	ron_	From that menu, select System Settings, and from that submenu Network Settings
2005-03-01T07:09:00.000Z	Vjaz	ron_	if you're using a local network and don't want to setup DHCP, you'll use that configuration application, select your network card, then "Properties" and switch it to manual configuration.
2005-03-01T07:10:00.000Z	Vjaz	ron_	Then set your ip to 192.168.0.1 or something, and 192.168.0.2 for the other computer. (Examples, but you should start it with 192.168 in any case)
2005-03-01T07:11:00.000Z	Vjaz	ron_	Hm... you probably don't want to do that unless you have two network cards.
2005-03-01T07:11:00.000Z	Vjaz	ron_	How are your computers connected?
2005-03-01T07:15:00.000Z	Vjaz	ron_	By the way, have you searched the forums?
2005-03-01T07:26:00.000Z	Vjaz	ron_	Is the network configured via DHCP or is it manual?
