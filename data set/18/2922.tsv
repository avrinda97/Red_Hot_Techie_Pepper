2010-03-01T21:12:00.000Z	mplabs		Hello all !
2010-03-01T21:13:00.000Z	mplabs		Can I set a "general" proxy ? I mean, I want to use internet ALWAYS trough a specify proxy, doesn't matter the port, always the same proxy. Can I do that ?
2010-03-01T21:14:00.000Z	nibbler	mplabs	well, in firefox you can. and be aware that not all protocols/applications support proxys, maybe a (open)vpn might help you?
2010-03-01T21:14:00.000Z	mplabs	nibbler	I know that I can in Firefox, but I'm talking to set a proxy, I mean.. at the "system level", I don't know if it exists
2010-03-01T21:15:00.000Z	mplabs		I mean, I set that and then I don't need to tell firefox to use one, because Linux will redirect the request
2010-03-01T21:15:00.000Z	mplabs		can you understand me ?
2010-03-01T21:16:00.000Z	nibbler	mplabs	there is enviroment variables HTTP_PROX which are interprted by a many programs
2010-03-01T21:17:00.000Z	mplabs		HTTP_PROXY=http://proxy application #in the comman line, right ?
2010-03-01T21:17:00.000Z	mplabs	nibbler	is it ?
2010-03-01T21:18:00.000Z	nibbler	mplabs	you should ahve this in /etc/profile or something. also prepend "export"
2010-03-01T21:19:00.000Z	mplabs	nibbler	maybe you have another idea, I will tell you why I want that. the problem if that I can surf internet or make request just trough a server, and in this server just trough secures connections (https?). so I need to do something easier to work with, otherwise I need two levels of proxies :P
2010-03-01T21:20:00.000Z	nibbler	mplabs	not sure what you mean
2010-03-01T21:20:00.000Z	mplabs		for example, to surf internet with Firefox I need to set the proxy in Firefox and to use https://concealme.com to request
2010-03-01T21:20:00.000Z	mplabs		like a Firefox proxy and then an HTTPS request
2010-03-01T21:22:00.000Z	mplabs		because I need to request trough this server proxy, but I just allowed to do request trough the 443 (is it ?) port
2010-03-01T21:23:00.000Z	mplabs	nibbler	can you understand now
2010-03-01T21:23:00.000Z	mplabs		?
2010-03-01T22:05:00.000Z	mplabs	nibbler	thank you !
