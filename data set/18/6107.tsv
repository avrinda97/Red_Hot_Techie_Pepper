2009-01-13T16:37:00.000Z	beastax		                  Device section "Configured Video Device" must have a Driver
2009-01-13T16:37:00.000Z	beastax		                  line.
2009-01-13T16:37:00.000Z	beastax		oops sorry retarded paste
2009-01-13T16:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	beastax	you need to change the xorg.conf a little
2009-01-13T16:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	beastax	if you rename the line above Driver "nvidia"
2009-01-13T16:40:00.000Z	beastax	ActionParsnip	section "Device" - identifier "nvidia"?
2009-01-13T16:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	beastax	if you rename the line *above* Driver "nvidia" to read Identifier "Configured Video Device" and change line 55 in your pastebin to reflect this change (Device0 to Configured Video Device) you should be ok
2009-01-13T16:44:00.000Z	beastax	ActionParsnip	ziroday im gonna try changing this line, brb
2009-01-13T16:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	beastax	did you install the nvidia driver from repo?
2009-01-13T16:44:00.000Z	beastax	ActionParsnip	yes
2009-01-13T16:45:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	beastax	make sure you run: sudo apt-get install nvidia-177-kernel-source nvidia-settings
