2012-06-13T04:23:00.000Z	Skaperen		supposedly Samsung is open sourcing drivers for the Galaxy S II ... but I haven't looked to see if they are out there, yet
2012-06-13T04:24:00.000Z	Smashcat	Skaperen	Some of the hardware in the phones call stacks use a lot of proprietary tech I think, so they can't open them.
2012-06-13T04:24:00.000Z	Skaperen	Smashcat	they _said_ they were ... issue as you mention might delay or prevent that ... need to find out if it ever happens
2012-06-13T04:25:00.000Z	Skaperen	Smashcat	if Samsung does want to go open and gain a market edge that way, they are big enough to force chip makers and such to accept open
2012-06-13T04:25:00.000Z	Smashcat	Skaperen	Android's about as open as it gets though - I develop on the platform, and also OSX -  there's a big difference :-)
2012-06-13T04:26:00.000Z	Skaperen	Smashcat	I need to get into doing Android ... but my love for OS building means I want ot build the whole thing from source and load my own image on to my Galaxy S II
2012-06-13T04:27:00.000Z	Smashcat	Skaperen	Like most corps though, they do whatever makes the most money - if there's no advantage to opening up some other parts of a product, they don't do it
2012-06-13T04:29:00.000Z	Skaperen	Smashcat	wow ... are they all unlocked or rooted?
2012-06-13T04:29:00.000Z	Smashcat	Skaperen	No, just normal phones - no sim cards, unlocked - they only need wireless connections at the  next event.
2012-06-13T04:29:00.000Z	Skaperen	Smashcat	you got that wifi adhoc walkit-talkie app on them?
2012-06-13T04:30:00.000Z	Smashcat	Skaperen	They're going to be running an app I'm working on - nothing else really.
2012-06-13T04:30:00.000Z	Skaperen	Smashcat	what does your app do?  gonna open source it?
2012-06-13T04:31:00.000Z	Smashcat	Skaperen	No, it's specifically for a corporate event - it has no purpose outside of that. Like most of my stuff, it's all owned by the client after i hand it over.
2012-06-13T04:31:00.000Z	Skaperen	Smashcat	I see ... work for hire stuff
2012-06-13T04:32:00.000Z	Skaperen	Smashcat	but you could build an open source app if you wanted to
2012-06-13T04:32:00.000Z	Smashcat	Skaperen	Yep. I did a job for the Google stand at the Mobile World Conference inBarcelona a few months back. A Claw arcade machine controlled by an Android tablet (using tilt and touch). Even the Google CEO had a go - heh
2012-06-13T04:33:00.000Z	Skaperen	Smashcat	nice
2012-06-13T04:33:00.000Z	Smashcat	Skaperen	You can see it on Youtube still I think. Had little Android toys in it for people to win. There were queues on it (plus 2 other clone machines) all day every day at the conference :-)
