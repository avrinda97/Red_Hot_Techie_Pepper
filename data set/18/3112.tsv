2009-12-12T16:00:00.000Z	Newbie-Widget		does anyone know if theres a program that I can burn to cd, boot and it will allow me to boot from USB drive(s) ?
2009-12-12T16:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Newbie-Widget	 ive seen some disrtos that have that for their specific disrtos
2009-12-12T16:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Newbie-Widget	  alt- has a text based installer.
2009-12-12T16:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Newbie-Widget	 i think that url mentions such tools.
2009-12-12T16:19:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Newbie-Widget	 and i think theres more to it then justhosting the install cd
2009-12-13T13:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Newbie-Widget	 you could have C: be somewhere else.. but proberly C: is a good guess. yes.
2009-12-13T13:54:00.000Z	Newbie-Widget	Dr_Willis	ty :)
2009-12-13T13:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Newbie-Widget	 i found it easier to just setup a bootale flash drive then mess with netboot/installing
2009-12-13T13:55:00.000Z	Newbie-Widget	Dr_Willis	true, but my laptop doesnt support booting from USB :(
2009-12-13T13:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Newbie-Widget	 ewww..
2009-12-13T13:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Newbie-Widget	 ive only seen such things in a few specific cases. and if you had a bootabel cd.. you could just install from that anyway.
2009-12-13T13:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Newbie-Widget	 bummer.  I recall seeing somewhere a 'net-boot live cd' project. You booted the live-cd on one boxx and it would let you net-boot and install to other machines on the lan. but im not sure how active/useable it even was.
2009-12-13T13:58:00.000Z	Newbie-Widget	Dr_Willis	damn :S ,, if u remember, can let me know :)
2009-12-13T13:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Newbie-Widget	 i must of saw it on some of the UBuntu tutorial sites. but im not evne sure of what the name was.
