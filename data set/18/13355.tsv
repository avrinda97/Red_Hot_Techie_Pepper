2007-06-19T07:32:00.000Z	kitsune		Anybody point me in the direction of k9copy help? Is there a channel for kde apps?
2007-06-19T07:33:00.000Z	Xenguy	kitsune	re k9copy: could the problem just be the particular DVD?
2007-06-19T07:33:00.000Z	Xenguy	kitsune	IOW, have you used k9copy successfully on any DVD yet?
2007-06-19T07:33:00.000Z	kitsune	Xenguy	I don't think so. I've tried 2 other dvds
2007-06-19T07:34:00.000Z	Xenguy	kitsune	hrm, so there's no baseline established yet - I wonder what the problem could be?
2007-06-19T07:35:00.000Z	Xenguy	kitsune	do you have that libcss2 thingie installed?
2007-06-19T07:35:00.000Z	kitsune	Xenguy	one sec...
2007-06-19T07:36:00.000Z	Xenguy	kitsune	I'm thinking of 'libdvdcss2' apparently
2007-06-19T07:36:00.000Z	kitsune	Xenguy	yeah. I have that...
2007-06-19T07:37:00.000Z	Xenguy	kitsune	K, just checking
2007-06-19T07:37:00.000Z	Xenguy	kitsune	are you interested in AVI output, or does it have to be DVD quality?
2007-06-19T07:38:00.000Z	kitsune	Xenguy	I'd actually prefer avi. I only have a 40gb hard drive ^_^
2007-06-19T07:38:00.000Z	Xenguy	kitsune	me too ;-)  I *really* have come to like 'dvdrip'...
2007-06-19T07:38:00.000Z	kitsune	Xenguy	I'm trying that right now...
2007-06-19T07:39:00.000Z	Xenguy	kitsune	it is fussy to set up (just a bit), but once you satisfy its dependencies, it works quite nicely :-)
2007-06-19T07:39:00.000Z	Xenguy	kitsune	I usually do ~700Mb, and always '2-pass' (takes longer but better quality)
2007-06-19T07:40:00.000Z	kitsune	Xenguy	thanks. I'll look into that
2007-06-19T07:40:00.000Z	Xenguy	kitsune	have fun
