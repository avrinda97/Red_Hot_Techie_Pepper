2012-01-15T19:00:00.000Z	DragonSlay	MagPulse	linux is 100% secure.
2012-01-15T19:02:00.000Z	MagPulse	DragonSlay	I'm pretty confident about linux's security too, there's no widespread viruses for it, and for a system to be compromised it would have to be specifically targed. But that's what I'm worried about.
