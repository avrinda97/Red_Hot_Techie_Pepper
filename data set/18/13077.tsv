2006-01-15T06:46:00.000Z	theverant		or afterwards
2006-01-15T06:47:00.000Z	theverant		my other question was - why no root password?
2006-01-15T06:47:00.000Z	theverant		ah ok, thanks!
2006-01-15T06:48:00.000Z	theverant		this channel is way more active than #mandriva (the last distro I tested out)
2006-01-15T06:48:00.000Z	theverant		tanx
2006-01-15T06:48:00.000Z	theverant		I'm still not %100 sure about linux
2006-01-15T06:49:00.000Z	theverant		but after a month windows free it's hard to justify going back, despite the quirks I'm finding
2006-01-15T06:50:00.000Z	theverant		I want something fully functional or not at all
2006-01-15T06:51:00.000Z	theverant		Is Dapper Drake stable?  It's what I've installed... I guess I'll find out the hard way :)
2006-01-15T06:52:00.000Z	theverant		so pretty much like running WinXP, eh
2006-01-15T06:52:00.000Z	nics_	theverant	depends what you use it for, fine for me at present though flashplayer plugin for firefox nows causes it to crash
2006-01-15T06:52:00.000Z	theverant	nics_	- I want to use it for GIMP mostly
2006-01-15T06:53:00.000Z	theverant		I would like to find decent video editing too, which I guess would be Cinelerra
2006-01-15T06:53:00.000Z	theverant		other than that it's just gravy :)
2006-01-15T06:53:00.000Z	nics_	theverant	has been fine for me with gimp, though just down screenshots and a few touchups, the thing to remember is that is is ALPHA, all bets are off :-)
2006-01-15T06:53:00.000Z	theverant	nics_	-praps I should go back to last stable
2006-01-15T06:54:00.000Z	theverant		which uses less resources - Gnome or KDE?
2006-01-15T06:55:00.000Z	nics_	theverant	always an option or just make sure you save all work often just in case, filesystems are rock solid but the odd app may suddenly break as things get upgraded, like flash in firefox at present
