2007-03-14T16:07:00.000Z	preaction	denis_on_ubuntu	that's what you're supposed to get?
2007-03-14T16:07:00.000Z	denis_on_ubuntu	preaction	- then how do i make my card connect wirelessly after that point? i dont seem to have any luck with this
2007-03-14T16:08:00.000Z	preaction	denis_on_ubuntu	did you install gnome-network-manager?
2007-03-14T16:08:00.000Z	preaction	denis_on_ubuntu	did you logout/login?
2007-03-14T16:08:00.000Z	preaction	denis_on_ubuntu	do you see the gnome-network-manager icon in your notification area?
2007-03-14T16:09:00.000Z	preaction	denis_on_ubuntu	can you right click on it and see your wireless card?
2007-03-14T16:10:00.000Z	preaction	denis_on_ubuntu	did you try clicking on that? and could you put my nickname and not use the enter key as punctuation? makes it easier to follow the conversation
2007-03-14T16:13:00.000Z	preaction	denis_on_ubuntu	i'm installing the network manager, hang on
2007-03-14T16:15:00.000Z	denis_on_ubuntu	preaction	thanks for your help i appreciate it - i've been trying to setup wireless for a long time now heh
2007-03-14T16:21:00.000Z	denis_on_ubuntu	preaction	I guess I am not sure how to make sure that i installed the wireless card correctly - but going through the forum instructions is just really confusing, moreso because things do not work the same way on the instructions as on my box lol
2007-03-14T16:25:00.000Z	denis_on_ubuntu	preaction	any luck with network manager man?
2007-03-14T16:26:00.000Z	preaction	denis_on_ubuntu	no, user switching crashed my vm
2007-03-14T16:27:00.000Z	denis_on_ubuntu	preaction	ok well i dunno. Is there some application that works like the wireless icon in windows, where it shows you a list of available connections around you?
2007-03-14T16:27:00.000Z	preaction	denis_on_ubuntu	that's what the network manager will do
2007-03-14T16:28:00.000Z	denis_on_ubuntu	preaction	really? ok - heh cuz it doesnt show any connections around me so, where would i go from there?
2007-03-14T16:28:00.000Z	preaction	denis_on_ubuntu	probably doesn't because it doesn't think you have a wireless card?
2007-03-14T16:29:00.000Z	denis_on_ubuntu	preaction	so how would i get it to think that i have a wireless card, like i installed ndiswrapper and did the command to rap it around the driver, but i'm confused what to do past that point
