2007-09-03T08:35:00.000Z	harry		i did an fsck, so dumb.  i got an error 2 of my grub.
2007-09-03T08:35:00.000Z	stefg	harry	didi you force it to run on a mounted filesystem?
2007-09-03T08:35:00.000Z	harry		now i installed ubuntu again. to my other partition so that i will not lose any data from my previoues
2007-09-03T08:35:00.000Z	harry	stefg	i think
2007-09-03T08:36:00.000Z	stefg		!es
2007-09-03T08:36:00.000Z	harry	stefg	problem now is hda3 was my previous one. i'm looking at hda3 right now and theres nothing inside of it.
2007-09-03T08:36:00.000Z	stefg		!pt
2007-09-03T08:37:00.000Z	stefg	harry	whatever you did, this could mean the partition is nuked...
2007-09-03T08:37:00.000Z	harry	stefg	are the data is still there. or i got out of luck
2007-09-03T08:38:00.000Z	stefg	harry	can't tell without knowing exactly what you did
2007-09-03T08:39:00.000Z	harry	stefg	well its said something about an inode which i know nothing about it. out of curiosity i just choosed yes. and yes and yes. after a while, i noticed it just keep on going. so i ctrl+c to exit.
2007-09-03T08:40:00.000Z	harry	stefg	after that. opening any of my files is already impossible. i got error messages for everything i try to open. even for nautilus
2007-09-03T08:42:00.000Z	stefg	harry	hmmm.... but you mounted the drive again, which could have been a mistake. if something like that happens, it's better to boot the Live CD and carefully examine the situation from there (before reinstalling, which might have overwritten the partition altogether)
2007-09-03T08:43:00.000Z	stefg	harry	are you sure you're looking t the right partition?
2007-09-03T08:43:00.000Z	harry	stefg	yeah i tried that. i booted from the CD. after booting. while on the live cd desktop. I can't open the hda3 anymore. but hda1 i can still open. hda2 is my swap
2007-09-03T08:44:00.000Z	harry		hda1 was my windows partition with nothing but games. stefg
2007-09-03T08:45:00.000Z	stefg	harry	so hda3 was your previous ubuntu install, but you couldn't even mout it from Live CD?. Then the data was lost probably before, and there's not much chance to recover anything
2007-09-03T08:46:00.000Z	harry	stefg	ok i get it now. thanks. that just mean one thing. whatever i have inside of it. i'll just have to download those again. geez
