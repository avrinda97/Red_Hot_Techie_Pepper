2007-05-06T09:56:00.000Z	rishi		hey guys
2007-05-06T09:56:00.000Z	rishi		I _just_ migrated from windows literally minutes ago
2007-05-06T09:56:00.000Z	rishi		and I'm completely lost
2007-05-06T09:56:00.000Z	Nrbelex_	rishi	what are you lost with?
2007-05-06T09:57:00.000Z	rishi		first off I got to get this beeping noise to stop!
2007-05-06T09:57:00.000Z	Nrbelex_	rishi	what kind of beeping noise?
2007-05-06T09:57:00.000Z	rishi		for instance
2007-05-06T09:57:00.000Z	rishi		whenever you say my name here, i get this loud beep
2007-05-06T09:58:00.000Z	rishi		well, I'm using chatzilla via firefox, unfortunately I can't turn it off
2007-05-06T09:59:00.000Z	rishi		oh thank god: disabled system beep
2007-05-06T09:59:00.000Z	rishi		now, on to my next task
2007-05-06T10:00:00.000Z	rishi	DanaG	I'm assuming I have to open up the console & type that in
2007-05-06T10:00:00.000Z	rishi		which brings me to my next question: How do you open the console?
2007-05-06T10:01:00.000Z	rishi		is this what I need to install drivers and such?
2007-05-06T10:02:00.000Z	rishi		I have a Dell E1705 laptop, but the screen resolution is set to 1024x768
2007-05-06T10:02:00.000Z	rishi		when my native resolution is 1440x900
2007-05-06T10:03:00.000Z	rishi		woah, what?
2007-05-06T10:03:00.000Z	Nrbelex_	rishi	copy paste that into the terminal
