2011-12-10T16:48:00.000Z	dragomir		good morning everyone. I have ubuntu 10.04 and I copied some files using the gui from an external hard drive to home/desktop using sudo nautilus. the folder shows up in sudo nautilus but not on my regular desktop. very strange. can someone please help me?
2011-12-10T16:48:00.000Z	dr_willis	dragomir	 if you used sudo, then the files are most likely owned by root. check your Desktop file via cli. and see if they are there.
2011-12-10T16:49:00.000Z	dr_willis	dragomir	 if you want your user to access them. You need to chown them to be owned by your user.
2011-12-10T16:49:00.000Z	dr_willis	dragomir	 what filesystem is on the external disK?
2011-12-10T16:51:00.000Z	dr_willis	dragomir	 any single file bigger then 4gb?
2011-12-10T16:51:00.000Z	dragomir	dr_willis	i dont think so.
2011-12-10T16:51:00.000Z	dragomir	dr_willis	your right
2011-12-10T16:52:00.000Z	dragomir	dr_willis	so how would you suggest I copy them over to my computer? when I copied and pasted after mounting, it said i didnt have permission
2011-12-10T16:53:00.000Z	dr_willis	dragomir	 they are owned by root.. so you ned to use root to either chown them to be owned by your user. or mount the filesystem where users can access it so you dont need to do 'sudo nautiuls' any more
2011-12-10T16:55:00.000Z	dr_willis	dragomir	 a single nautilus window - hit F3 == it will split into '2' windows I think. :)
2011-12-10T16:56:00.000Z	dragomir	dr_willis	i appreciate all your help
2011-12-10T17:04:00.000Z	dragomir	dr_willis	i got the file permissions link open the first time. I have it open right now, and I didn't see any mention of GUI access.
2011-12-10T17:05:00.000Z	dr_willis	dragomir	 i alwyas use the command line to adjust permissions and ownership.
2011-12-10T17:05:00.000Z	dragomir	dr_willis	yea it seems more thorough, but I am afraid of doing something wrong.
2011-12-10T17:08:00.000Z	dragomir	dr_willis	but once I reformat the external drive to hsf, I plan on copying the files back over to the drive to be used on another computer (mac) with a different username
2011-12-10T17:26:00.000Z	dragomir	dr_willis	did you give up on me?
2011-12-10T17:29:00.000Z	dr_willis	dragomir	 i dont even recall the issue..
2011-12-10T17:29:00.000Z	dragomir	dr_willis	its OK, thanks anyways.
