2010-10-19T14:42:00.000Z	tripelb		PS I'm the girl who wants to repartition the drive. I've got gparted up and ready. I am 'smart' enough to get a hand with something so potentially troubling. Lets just do it. I need to move all my data so it can be accessed by XP or Ubu.
2010-10-19T14:43:00.000Z	ectospasm	tripelb	are you asking a question?
2010-10-19T14:43:00.000Z	tripelb	ectospasm	yes just a sec and I will copy it. pidgin will not let me uparrow a previous comment
2010-10-19T14:44:00.000Z	tripelb	ectospasm	there it is
2010-10-19T14:45:00.000Z	tripelb	ectospasm	 did you see my question?
2010-10-19T14:45:00.000Z	ectospasm	tripelb	resize the 1TB part to be just the size you want, then create new partition(s) on free space.  Pretty simple with gparted.
2010-10-19T14:45:00.000Z	ectospasm	tripelb	do you have a backup, just in case?
2010-10-19T14:48:00.000Z	tripelb	ectospasm	did you see my question?

2010-10-19T14:51:00.000Z	tripelb	ectospasm	NO and I dont have anything to back it up on.
2010-10-19T14:52:00.000Z	tripelb	ectospasm	I have to go to sleep. This has all taken too long.
2010-10-19T14:52:00.000Z	ectospasm	tripelb	I wouldn't do it if you're squeamish, or if you can't afford to lose that data.
2010-10-19T14:53:00.000Z	tripelb	ectospasm	is there any way windows can read the files from ext4?
2010-10-19T14:54:00.000Z	ectospasm	tripelb	there may be an experimental XP driver that can read ext4.  I remember there were efforst waaaay back to have XP read ext2

2010-10-19T15:01:00.000Z	ectospasm	tripelb	not ready for prime time?  My 92 year old grandfather uses Ubuntu.  Can't say he'd have a clue what to do with Windows.  At least Ubuntu doesn't *require* constant administration.  Can't say the same for Windows.  and she's gone
