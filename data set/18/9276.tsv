2007-05-12T10:32:00.000Z	biouser		anyone connect to a hidden network on a regular basis?
2007-05-12T10:32:00.000Z	biouser		there is no encryption
2007-05-12T10:33:00.000Z	orbin	biouser	i can connect to hidden networks, but i have to manually enter details
2007-05-12T10:33:00.000Z	biouser	orbin	do you use a network manager?
2007-05-12T10:33:00.000Z	orbin	biouser	i use the applet, yes
2007-05-12T10:33:00.000Z	biouser	orbin	which?
2007-05-12T10:34:00.000Z	orbin		network manager applet (nm-applet)
2007-05-12T10:34:00.000Z	biouser		nm-applet, thanks orbin, I will try that, I usually use knetworkmanager, but it appears that there are confirmed bugs with hidden
2007-05-12T10:35:00.000Z	orbin	biouser	nm-applet is the gnome equivalent of knetworkmanager afaik
2007-05-12T10:35:00.000Z	orbin	biouser	not sure it would be much use if you run kde
2007-05-12T10:36:00.000Z	biouser	orbin	I run xfce with many gnome and kde apps
2007-05-12T10:37:00.000Z	orbin	biouser	it's an applet though.  unless you have a gnome panel running the notification area applet, i'm not sure how that would work in xfce
2007-05-12T10:41:00.000Z	biouser	orbin	can I apt-get something?
2007-05-12T10:42:00.000Z	orbin	biouser	?
2007-05-12T10:42:00.000Z	biouser	orbin	for nm-applet?
2007-05-12T10:43:00.000Z	biouser	orbin	I have network-manager and network-manager-gnome
2007-05-12T10:43:00.000Z	biouser	orbin	I just can't connect to a hidden wireless network for some reason
2007-05-12T10:44:00.000Z	orbin	biouser	network-manager-gnome provides the applet
