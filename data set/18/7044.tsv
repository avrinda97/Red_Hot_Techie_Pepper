2008-03-17T07:52:00.000Z	Tonren		I have a TON of photos of events in different subfolders of one top folder, and I want to be able to project a slideshow of all of them.  What's a slideshow image viewer that can take images recursively in a directory hierarchy?
2008-03-17T07:54:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Tonren	fspot is installed by default in ubuntu
2008-03-17T07:54:00.000Z	Tonren		Oh, thanks.
2008-03-17T07:54:00.000Z	Tonren		Uh... is the command called "fspot"?
2008-03-17T07:55:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Tonren	probably f-spot
2008-03-17T07:55:00.000Z	Tonren		I'm in Kubuntu, so maybe it's not default, but I can't even find it in an apt-cache search.
2008-03-17T07:55:00.000Z	Tonren	prince_jammys	ah, I didn't have the dash.  Thanks
2008-03-17T07:55:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Tonren	yes, but it's not part of kubuntu.  it's a gnomish app
2008-03-17T07:56:00.000Z	Tonren	prince_jammys	I'm okay with installing some GTK stuff
2008-03-17T07:56:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Tonren	there's kde stuff for that also
2008-03-17T07:56:00.000Z	Tonren	prince_jammys	I'm asking in KDE
2008-03-17T07:56:00.000Z	Tonren	prince_jammys	Err, #kubuntu
2008-03-17T07:56:00.000Z	prince_jammys		!info kuickshow | Tonren
2008-03-17T07:57:00.000Z	Tonren	prince_jammys	That doesn't fetch images from subfolders.
2008-03-17T08:00:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Tonren	check out digikam (installed by default in kubuntu, i think)
2008-03-17T08:14:00.000Z	Tonren	prince_jammys	Gah...!  DigiKam would be great, but it doesn't randomize them!  By the time one client's event photos are done, the day will be over.
2008-03-17T08:15:00.000Z	prince_jammys	Tonren	try f-spot
2008-03-17T08:18:00.000Z	Tonren	prince_jammys	Haha, it has to "import" all 4000 photos before I can do anything.  Man, who knew this'd be so hard?
