2005-04-09T16:20:00.000Z	Flonne		Yes, drspin.
2005-04-09T13:18:00.000Z	Flonne		It is, whenever possible.
2005-04-09T13:19:00.000Z	Flonne		apt/Synaptic/Kynaptic provides facilities for uninstallation and updating.
2005-04-09T13:19:00.000Z	Flonne		Self compilation requires manual management, and that can get ugly over time.
2005-04-09T13:20:00.000Z	Flonne		With your CPU, I mean.
2005-04-09T13:22:00.000Z	dockane	Flonne	its not garrut, its me who tries to set use the list of the cpu frequency monitor
2005-04-09T13:23:00.000Z	dockane	Flonne	the help says "If the frequencies menu is not shown, please ask to your system administrator." and here i am *?*
2005-04-09T13:24:00.000Z	dockane	Flonne	: i am running hoary on thinkpad with a mobile p3 and would like to use/control speedstep
2005-04-09T13:26:00.000Z	dockane	Flonne	do i expect the wrong things to do from "CPU Frequency Scaling Monitor Applet" ?
2005-04-09T13:27:00.000Z	dockane	Flonne	as i went to through the packet describtion it looked to me like to do exactly what i expect : show and set the cpu frequency
2005-04-09T13:28:00.000Z	Flonne	dockane	I'm pretty sure cpufreqd is what you want.
2005-04-09T13:30:00.000Z	dockane	Flonne	hmpf. do you know "CPU Frequency Scaling Monitor Applet" ? it came with the haory install and it's really nice apart of this sentence in the help : "If the frequencies menu is not shown, please ask to your system administrator."
2005-04-09T13:31:00.000Z	Flonne	dockane	can you link me to this help page? I'll take a look at it when I have time. (In the meantime, cpufreqd is able to sit in the background and control your processor automatically)
2005-04-09T13:34:00.000Z	dockane	Flonne	its "CPU Frequency Scaling Monitor : file://///usr/share/gnome/help/cpufreq-applet/C/cpufreq-applet.xml#index "
2005-04-09T13:35:00.000Z	dockane	Flonne	can you work with this link ?
2005-04-09T13:37:00.000Z	Flonne	dockane	cpufreq-applet suggests cpufreqd, cpudyn, or powernowd.
2005-04-09T13:46:00.000Z	dockane	Flonne	 ?
