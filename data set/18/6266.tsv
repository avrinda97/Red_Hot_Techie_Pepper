2008-06-27T02:03:00.000Z	Gaming4JC		Drk_guy are you looking for a .deb of dpkg?
2008-06-27T02:03:00.000Z	Drk_Guy	Gaming4JC	DEB
2008-06-30T05:22:00.000Z	Drk_Guy	Gaming4JC	I'm gonna try to make VDrift debs and store them on launchpad
2008-06-30T05:26:00.000Z	Drk_Guy	Gaming4JC	Install the kernel headers for your kernel, i'm sure it will help (helped me out with nvidia)
2008-06-30T05:26:00.000Z	Drk_Guy	Gaming4JC	Not sure about exact package name
2008-06-30T05:28:00.000Z	Drk_Guy	Gaming4JC	You got me?
2008-06-30T05:29:00.000Z	Drk_Guy	Gaming4JC	Try to remove it, sudo dpkg remove ... --force may help
2008-06-30T05:30:00.000Z	Drk_Guy	Gaming4JC	An incomplete configuration of a package won't allow you to install anything else
2008-06-30T05:30:00.000Z	Drk_Guy	Gaming4JC	Apt's resolution system is very though on that
2008-06-30T05:32:00.000Z	Gaming4JC	Drk_Guy	ok... E: dpkg was interrupted, you must manually run 'dpkg --configure -a' to correct the problem. (running apt-get)
2008-06-30T05:33:00.000Z	Drk_Guy	Gaming4JC	Can you boot int he old kernel?
2008-06-30T05:33:00.000Z	Drk_Guy	Gaming4JC	That may help out
2008-06-30T05:33:00.000Z	Drk_Guy	Gaming4JC	you DO have the kernel headers
2008-06-30T05:34:00.000Z	Drk_Guy	Gaming4JC	But for an older kernel, if you boot up in that kernel, the headers will coincide, and the package will configure well ;)
2008-06-30T05:34:00.000Z	Drk_Guy	Gaming4JC	Think bout it, brb
2008-06-30T05:51:00.000Z	Drk_Guy	Gaming4JC	I think booting into that old kernel will make it
2008-06-30T05:53:00.000Z	Drk_Guy	Gaming4JC	Smash ESC at boot-time so grub shows up menu instead of booting directly into kernel
2008-06-30T05:54:00.000Z	Drk_Guy	Gaming4JC	"Good Luck, Keyes Out..."
