2010-06-14T16:23:00.000Z	NitzchONot		Any idea how can i change my 'Login Screen' With a custom one ? Not just Background Image, but the dialog too in 10.04 ? :)
2010-06-14T16:23:00.000Z	sebsebseb	NitzchONot	you can't
2010-06-14T16:23:00.000Z	sebsebseb	NitzchONot	not with GDM 2
2010-06-14T16:24:00.000Z	sebsebseb	NitzchONot	so KDM or Slim instead :)
2010-06-14T16:24:00.000Z	NitzchONot	sebsebseb	so there's not any workaround ?
2010-06-14T16:24:00.000Z	sebsebseb	NitzchONot	not that I know of
2010-06-14T16:25:00.000Z	NitzchONot	sebsebseb	so the only way it's to switch to KDM, correct ?
2010-06-14T16:25:00.000Z	sebsebseb	NitzchONot	basically yeah, or Slim, or maybe LXDM
2010-06-14T16:25:00.000Z	sebsebseb	NitzchONot	Slim is very customizable
2010-06-14T16:26:00.000Z	sebsebseb	NitzchONot	nice themes on there site, and woudn't take much to make your own it seems according to the site.
2010-06-14T16:26:00.000Z	sebsebseb	NitzchONot	if you install from Ubuntu repo, it will give you the Debian theme, since Ubuntu is based on Debian, but  easy enough to change the theme,  see website for details
2010-06-14T16:27:00.000Z	NitzchONot	sebsebseb	thanks for your time, i'll look in to it :)
2010-06-14T16:27:00.000Z	sebsebseb	NitzchONot	I like KDM from the Ubuntu repo,  for a few reasons, but it does come with a nice theme by default :)
2010-06-14T16:27:00.000Z	sebsebseb	NitzchONot	ok np
2010-06-14T16:28:00.000Z	NitzchONot	sebsebseb	consider im new in all that linux/ubuntu stuff.. kdm isnt it KDE? another 'desktop enviroment' for linux?
2010-06-14T16:30:00.000Z	sebsebseb	NitzchONot	yes its KDE
2010-06-14T16:30:00.000Z	sebsebseb	NitzchONot	and most KDE apps you can run inside Gnome as well
2010-06-14T16:31:00.000Z	sebsebseb	NitzchONot	sudo apt-get install kdm and select it
