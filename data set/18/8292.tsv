2008-01-19T17:40:00.000Z	playya	BernardB	what says lsof ?
2008-01-19T17:42:00.000Z	BernardB	playya	do I have to pastebin?
2008-01-19T17:43:00.000Z	playya	BernardB	but use also the mountpoint as an srguement
2008-01-19T17:44:00.000Z	BernardB	playya	what do you mean, exactly?
2008-01-19T17:44:00.000Z	playya	BernardB	you said you mounted a image
2008-01-19T17:45:00.000Z	playya	BernardB	then add the mointpoint as an argument of lsof
2008-01-19T17:46:00.000Z	BernardB	playya	so: lsof <path where the image is mounted>
2008-01-19T17:47:00.000Z	playya	BernardB	yes
2008-01-19T17:48:00.000Z	BernardB	playya	but that's because I quit the installer.
2008-01-19T17:48:00.000Z	playya	BernardB	yes
2008-01-19T17:49:00.000Z	BernardB	playya	must I mount the image in cdrom of cdrom0? And do I have to mount both of the CDs when I'm going to start the installer?
2008-01-19T17:50:00.000Z	playya	BernardB	i dont think you have to mount in cdrom0. but using 2 differnet mountpoints might help if you can choose the source
2008-01-19T17:52:00.000Z	BernardB	playya	If I mount CD 1 to cdrom0, cdrom is also mounted.
2008-01-19T17:52:00.000Z	playya	BernardB	you can mount the image to any directory you want
2008-01-19T17:59:00.000Z	playya	BernardB	a way to change the source of cd 2?
2008-01-19T18:00:00.000Z	BernardB	playya	do you mean, changing the mount point to the mount point of CD 1?
2008-01-19T18:04:00.000Z	BernardB	playya	I don't get it. I just can't unmount CD 1.
2008-01-19T18:08:00.000Z	BernardB	playya	I don't get it. I just can't unmount CD 1.
