2010-09-11T17:41:00.000Z	cba123		I need to unrar all the files in a folder.  I tried "find -type f -name '*.rar' -exec unrar x {} \;" but they are all failing to unrar.  Any ideas?
2010-09-11T17:43:00.000Z	jrib	cba123	failing how?
2010-09-11T17:45:00.000Z	cba123	jrib	It says "failed to unrar" but it tries to unrar each part individually, so I think it was just that it was trying to unrar each file individually.
2010-09-11T17:45:00.000Z	jrib	cba123	well your glob is not specific enough I suppose, you want only the first part, no?
2010-09-11T17:46:00.000Z	cba123	jrib	I want them all unrared.
2010-09-11T17:46:00.000Z	jrib	cba123	and you unrar multi-part rars by unrarring the first part, don't you?
2010-09-11T17:47:00.000Z	cba123	jrib	Yeah
2010-09-11T17:48:00.000Z	jrib	cba123	so again, your glob is not specific enough.  glob only the first part
2010-09-11T17:50:00.000Z	cba123	jrib	mbn_18, nevermind, I figured it out (I forgot I passworded them).  Thanks for the help.
2011-03-24T17:40:00.000Z	jrib	cba123	kpettit: -d is only to upgrade to development releases
2011-03-24T17:45:00.000Z	cba123	jrib	Thanks, but I don't need an upgrade, I have /home separate, so I can format / without an issue.  I am just asking how I can initiate the "upgrade" from my existing install.  It's an eeepc so no CD-Rom.
2011-03-24T17:45:00.000Z	jrib	cba123	can't you just install 10.10 the same way you installed 9.10?
2011-03-24T17:46:00.000Z	jrib	cba123	erm, 9.04 I mean
2011-03-24T17:46:00.000Z	cba123	jrib	I'm trying, but unetbootin didn't have an option for 10.10, I had to manually add an 10.10 iso.  It doesn't seem to boot normally.
2011-03-24T17:47:00.000Z	jrib	cba123	I see.  Did you try usb disk creator?
2011-03-24T17:47:00.000Z	jrib	cba123	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/FromUSBStick
2011-03-24T17:47:00.000Z	cba123	jrib	No, didn't try that, thanks.
2011-03-24T18:01:00.000Z	cba123	jrib	Thanks, that's working.
