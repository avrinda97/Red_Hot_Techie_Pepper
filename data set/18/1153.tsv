2011-06-18T06:32:00.000Z	Cuchulainn	mahir256	ok...so i'm guessing that instead of working like a ps2 keyboard that works on an interrupt...
2011-06-18T06:33:00.000Z	Cuchulainn	mahir256	it work more like a network layer, where it sends until it receives ACK or not?
2011-06-18T06:34:00.000Z	Cuchulainn	mahir256	so it just depends on the manufacturer?
2011-06-18T06:36:00.000Z	Cuchulainn	mahir256	ok...so here's the issue i'm having, maybe you can point me in the right direction
2011-06-18T06:37:00.000Z	Cuchulainn	mahir256	when logging in, i have a 1/2 sec lag or so on the keyboard (have to press and hold)...which is annoying with a masked psswd...
2011-06-18T06:37:00.000Z	Cuchulainn	mahir256	but once i log in...it's fine and responsive....
2011-06-18T06:38:00.000Z	Cuchulainn	mahir256	this happened once before when i was running the beta, but when i reinstalled the full release it was fine...until 3-4 updates, and it reverted
2011-06-18T06:38:00.000Z	Cuchulainn	mahir256	maybe you have an idea as to where to start troubleshooting?
2011-06-18T06:39:00.000Z	Cuchulainn	mahir256	aka what is different about the loading up until login, that might change after?
2011-06-18T06:40:00.000Z	Cuchulainn	mahir256	iz.rr.com) has left #ubuntu
2011-06-18T06:40:00.000Z	Cuchulainn	mahir256	 msi u-100 wind netbook
2011-06-18T06:45:00.000Z	Cuchulainn	mahir256	that certainly makes sense...although if i require third party driver during install, it is hidden and i am unaware...any idea where to go see what i'm using during session as opposed to what i'm using at login...
2011-06-18T06:46:00.000Z	Cuchulainn	mahir256	then maybe i can figure out how to force the login to match?
2011-06-18T06:59:00.000Z	Cuchulainn	mahir256	nw...appreciate the effort...having no luck here either...is there somewhere i can see what driver is being used at login, as opposed to within session/
2011-06-18T06:59:00.000Z	Cuchulainn	mahir256	/
2011-06-18T06:59:00.000Z	Cuchulainn	mahir256	seems to be a problem pretty specific to me...
2011-06-18T07:03:00.000Z	Cuchulainn	mahir256	nw...i appreciate the attempt...too inexperienced to know myself...
