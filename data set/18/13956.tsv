2009-12-08T09:02:00.000Z	ardchoille	Fezzler	How did you install it?
2009-12-08T09:03:00.000Z	ardchoille	Fezzler	Many sources include a "make uninstall" option. Try: sudo make uninstall
2009-12-08T09:03:00.000Z	ardchoille	Fezzler	That command should be done from the folder of the sources
2009-12-08T09:04:00.000Z	ardchoille	Fezzler	If all else fails, you can go into the make file and see where everything was installed
2009-12-08T09:13:00.000Z	ardchoille	Fezzler	take a look at the make file, it tells the system where to put the files. An install is usually just copying compiled files to the system
2009-12-08T09:13:00.000Z	ardchoille	Fezzler	Look for the "Install" section of the make file
2009-12-08T09:16:00.000Z	ardchoille	Fezzler	What is the url of the package you compiled?
2009-12-08T09:18:00.000Z	ardchoille	Fezzler	hold on, I'm looking at the sources now
2009-12-08T09:19:00.000Z	ardchoille	Fezzler	ok, you compiled it with: make  and you run it with ./gdigi  ?
2009-12-08T09:20:00.000Z	ardchoille	Fezzler	ok, now this is unusual with sources for an app. since you compiled and are running the binary from the sources folder, you can simply delete the sources filder and the app is gone.
2009-12-08T09:21:00.000Z	ardchoille	Fezzler	You should also look in your home fodler to see if there are any dot files or folders that have to do with this app
2009-12-08T09:21:00.000Z	ardchoille	Fezzler	Again, this is unusual practice for compiled apps, you won't be able to get away with this type of uninstall in every app you compile
2009-12-08T09:22:00.000Z	ardchoille	Fezzler	ok, should be fine then
2009-12-08T09:22:00.000Z	ardchoille	Fezzler	 That's the simplest make file I've ever seen
2009-12-08T09:24:00.000Z	ardchoille	Fezzler	look at the "Setup" section on this page, it details how to install on Ubuntu: http://desowin.org/gdigi/
2009-12-08T09:25:00.000Z	ardchoille	Fezzler	Those steps are in the correct order: sudo apt-get, wget, tar, cd, make, run
2009-12-08T09:25:00.000Z	ardchoille	Fezzler	one line at a time
