2009-12-30T15:07:00.000Z	splig		how can i restart pulse server after suspend?? it's not running. i need reboot to sound
2009-12-30T15:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	splig	run: killall pulseaudio    then press alt+f2   and type: pulseaudio    and hit enter
2009-12-30T15:09:00.000Z	splig	ActionParsnip	i can't... looks like it can not found the sound card....
2009-12-30T15:09:00.000Z	splig		i did what you said but still says "AO: [pulse] Failed to connect to server: Invalid argument" when i try to play
2009-12-30T15:10:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	splig	looks like you will need to rmmod the module that drives it, then modprobe it back in
2009-12-30T15:10:00.000Z	splig		which module is it? snd?
2009-12-30T15:11:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	splig	sudo lshw -C sound    will tell you, its the driver bit at the bottom of the output
2009-12-30T15:12:00.000Z	splig		:s i don't understand... never mind i will reboot. anyway i will install 9.10 in some days, probably it's solved
2009-12-30T15:12:00.000Z	splig		thanks ActionParsnip
2009-12-30T15:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	splig	may help too: http://blog.techytim.com/2009/01/28/ubuntu-sound-fix/
2009-12-30T15:12:00.000Z	splig		ok
2009-12-30T15:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	splig	you will need a bit of digging to see what makes you card ok after suspend. its a real PITA to get nice
2009-12-30T15:15:00.000Z	splig		if i use alsa it's ok, i added some lines in suspend.sh (or something like this)
