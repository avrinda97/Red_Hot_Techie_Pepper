2008-07-13T01:44:00.000Z	dr_Willis	xxschwartzxx	 try that pendrivelinux web site.  ive only used livecd/disrtos on my usb pendrives. so cant help on a full ubuntu isntall on a hd.
2008-07-13T01:57:00.000Z	dr_Willis	xxschwartzxx	 well the install process normally partitions, a disk,creating filesystems that get formated and installed to... So  those filesystems will get formated yes...
2008-07-13T01:59:00.000Z	dr_Willis	xxschwartzxx	 you can resize the exsisting partitions. and free up some unallocated space. You do NOT need to use the whole drive.
2008-07-13T01:59:00.000Z	dr_Willis	xxschwartzxx	 you are using the term formating in the totally wrong way.
2008-07-13T02:00:00.000Z	dr_Willis	xxschwartzxx	 http://www.pendrivelinux.com/2008/04/14/ubuntu-804-usb-hard-drive-install/  is a guide i just saw.  and No ive never  installed ubuntu to a external usb drive.
2008-07-13T02:00:00.000Z	dr_Willis	xxschwartzxx	  You partition a drive. creating 'filesystems' you then format the filesystems to make them useable.
2008-07-13T02:01:00.000Z	dr_Willis	xxschwartzxx	 you can have several parttiions on a single hard drive.
2008-07-13T02:02:00.000Z	dr_Willis	xxschwartzxx	  You can RESIZE the existing partitions, and install ubuntu to the 'unallocated' space. by telling the installer to do so. (at step7 of that web tutorial i posted)
2008-07-13T02:05:00.000Z	xxschwartzxx	dr_Willis	With the guide you showed me, exactly how big would the CD you burn it to need to be?
2008-07-13T02:06:00.000Z	dr_Willis	xxschwartzxx	 the cd?   the ubuntu install cd fits on a normal cd i thought.
2008-07-13T02:08:00.000Z	dr_Willis	xxschwartzxx	  No idea.  Ive neer had to worry about the size of cd's
2008-07-13T02:08:00.000Z	dr_Willis	xxschwartzxx	 try burnign the iso with a tool like 'burnatonce' and see.
2008-07-15T08:38:00.000Z	dr_Willis	xxschwartzxx	 you could export your PATH to look for a directory anywhere.
