2006-09-04T05:45:00.000Z	Dimensions		Hi guys .... how can i use or install Visual basic in ubuntu ?
2006-09-04T05:46:00.000Z	Dimensions		i have wine installed but what does it do and if i have a VB project can i use it here ?
2006-09-04T05:47:00.000Z	Arafangion	Dimensions	What version of VB?
2006-09-04T05:48:00.000Z	Dimensions	Arafangion	VB 6
2006-09-04T05:48:00.000Z	Arafangion	Dimensions	Then it might be able to.
2006-09-04T05:48:00.000Z	Arafangion	Dimensions	If it was VB.NET, then you should give Mono a go.
2006-09-04T05:49:00.000Z	Arafangion	Dimensions	Personally, I run windows inside of qemu
2006-09-04T06:05:00.000Z	Dimensions	Arafangion	infact i have a script we run in ubuntu machines i want to make interface for it so one can click the command button only to initiate the script or stop it ... etc ...i thought i would use VB as i have done programming in it ... any other idea ? how can i implement it ?
2006-09-04T06:06:00.000Z	Arafangion	Dimensions	Ahh, so you have the source code?
2006-09-04T06:16:00.000Z	Dimensions	Arafangion	source code to script yes i do
2006-09-04T06:16:00.000Z	Arafangion	Dimensions	Is porting it to VB.NET an option?
2006-09-04T06:17:00.000Z	Arafangion	Dimensions	That way, mono should be able to run it.
2006-09-04T06:19:00.000Z	Arafangion	Dimensions	I'm not sure how good the mono vb compiler is, so you may be better off using the VB.NET compiler, and making sure that the options to NOT emit machine code is set. (The Microsoft compiler doesn't always produce clean .NET applications - you have to tell it to do so)
2006-09-04T06:20:00.000Z	Arafangion	Dimensions	If you don't want to port it, as it's a compiled aplpication, you may have good luck with wine.
2006-09-04T06:20:00.000Z	Arafangion	Dimensions	But in the long run, porting it is highly recommended.
2006-09-04T06:25:00.000Z	Arafangion	Dimensions	Just checked the mono website (www.go-mono.net), apparently the old version of the VB compiler is officially abandoned, and they're working on a new VB compiler, but it's not released yet.
2006-09-04T06:25:00.000Z	Arafangion	Dimensions	But, the main point is that it's all in a portable bytecode anyway, so as long as mono has the system.windows.forms that you use implemented, you should be set.
2006-09-04T06:25:00.000Z	Arafangion	Dimensions	That's the theory, anyway.
