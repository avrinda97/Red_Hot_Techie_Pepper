2007-07-29T11:08:00.000Z	xtknight		man pages suck
2007-07-29T11:09:00.000Z	xtknight		even for people who know what they're doing
2007-07-29T11:09:00.000Z	xtknight		most of the time they are awful for actually trying to do something.  look up a parameter, itll generally tell you what it does.  but i dislike them otherwise
2007-07-29T11:10:00.000Z	xtknight		man pages are more technical specifications of what a program does (by devs, for devs) rather than User Guides which these people need
2007-07-29T11:10:00.000Z	xtknight		ya i love wikis ;)
2007-07-29T11:11:00.000Z	xtknight		playstation potable
2007-07-29T11:13:00.000Z	xtknight		wodim/etc
2007-07-29T11:13:00.000Z	xtknight		and mkisofs
2007-07-29T11:13:00.000Z	xtknight		and not to mention it's rude
2007-07-29T11:13:00.000Z	xtknight		you probably wouldn't say it if you were talking to the guy in real life, so why say it here?
2007-07-29T11:13:00.000Z	IdNotFound	xtknight	you could just 'less file.nfo'
