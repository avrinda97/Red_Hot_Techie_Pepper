2007-06-14T13:07:00.000Z	sahil_		hey guys, BIG problem here. I cannot load ubuntu 2.6 version of Fiesty
2007-06-14T13:07:00.000Z	sahil_		i am in 2.1.5 Version
2007-06-14T13:07:00.000Z	Flannel	sahil_	2.1.5 of what?  feisty is 7.04
2007-06-14T13:08:00.000Z	sahil_	Flannel	yesh
2007-06-14T13:08:00.000Z	Flannel	sahil_	What is 2.1.6?  Version of what?
2007-06-14T13:09:00.000Z	sahil_	Flannel	you know when you choose your operating system
2007-06-14T13:09:00.000Z	Flannel	sahil_	you mean at GRUB?
2007-06-14T13:10:00.000Z	Flannel	sahil_	ok.  You'll need to double check those numbers, since neither are proper kernel versions
2007-06-14T13:15:00.000Z	sahil_	Flannel	sorry about that. My system is also very unstable
2007-06-14T13:15:00.000Z	Flannel	sahil_	pastebin your menu.lst (/boot/grub/menu.lst)
2007-06-14T13:16:00.000Z	sahil_	Flannel	i cannot open the menu.lst file even with sudo from terminal
2007-06-14T13:16:00.000Z	Flannel	sahil_	You don't need to use sudo.  And you missed the leading /: `gedit /boot/grub/menu.lst`
2007-06-14T13:18:00.000Z	sahil_	Flannel	i paste dit
2007-06-14T13:18:00.000Z	Flannel	sahil_	You need to give us the URL
2007-06-14T13:22:00.000Z	Flannel	sahil_	this looks normal.  You'll also notice that it's not 2.1.5 nor 2.1.6, but 2.6.20-15 and 2.6.20-16.  Anyway, whats the issue?  2.5.20-16 doesn't work?  What error does it give?  It's probably all the funky duplicate boot parameters.  Try `sudo update-grub`  that'll regenerate your menu.lst without all the oddities.
2007-06-14T13:22:00.000Z	sahil_	Flannel	it says that my graphical user interface, something with Xorg or Xserver failed to start
2007-06-14T13:23:00.000Z	Flannel	sahil_	I'd try sudo update-grub and try again.
2007-06-14T13:33:00.000Z	sahil_	Flannel	itr worked, that you VERY VERY VEYR VYER VEYR MUCH!
