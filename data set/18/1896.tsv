2010-12-20T01:47:00.000Z	KM0201		does Vbox-ose support USB now?  i know it didn't used to, thats why i always used the "non-free" one from the vbox repository
2010-12-20T01:48:00.000Z	Wyn	KM0201	i use the non free direct repo as well for that reason
2010-12-20T01:49:00.000Z	KM0201	Wyn	i was just wondering if that changed in Vbox-OSE... doesn't sound like it
2010-12-20T01:50:00.000Z	Wyn	KM0201	http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Linux_Downloads  it supports USB
2010-12-20T01:50:00.000Z	Wyn	KM0201	lol
2010-12-20T01:51:00.000Z	KM0201	Wyn	i know that oes... i'm talking about OSE edition.
2010-12-20T01:51:00.000Z	Wyn	KM0201	na, only vb /sun direct rocks de usb
2010-12-20T01:52:00.000Z	Wyn	KM0201	bit of a fail really
2010-12-20T01:53:00.000Z	Wyn	KM0201	kernel modules
2010-12-20T01:54:00.000Z	Wyn	KM0201	he needs to install vb first
2010-12-20T01:57:00.000Z	Wyn	KM0201	vb needs some kernel mods for virtulization, should come with install, not sure why he tried to install them sepratly
2010-12-20T01:58:00.000Z	KM0201	Wyn	i see... is this only required on the OSE install? cuz i didn't do that, i just installed it, and i run XP as a guest just fine
2010-12-20T01:58:00.000Z	Wyn	KM0201	chances are it put them in for you
2010-12-20T01:58:00.000Z	KM0201	Wyn	i guess... i just followed the instructions on virtualbox.org
2010-12-20T01:58:00.000Z	Wyn	KM0201	should not need to install them separately
2010-12-20T01:58:00.000Z	Wyn	KM0201	 same here
2010-12-20T01:59:00.000Z	KM0201	Wyn	i dunno, i guess not.. all i know is it gives me an easy way to sync my zune w/o needing to dual boot.
2010-12-20T01:59:00.000Z	Wyn	KM0201	whats a ZUne ?
