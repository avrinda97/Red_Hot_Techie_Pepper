2006-10-09T11:22:00.000Z	fick		well, since i cant get any help
2006-10-09T11:22:00.000Z	fick		i am going to try sucidally upgrading to edgy well running in vmware.... i have no other choice
2006-10-09T11:23:00.000Z	fick		its the only chance i have of getting ubuntu to do anything with my wireless
2006-10-09T11:23:00.000Z	fick		since bloody ndiswrapper.ko does not exist
2006-10-09T11:23:00.000Z	fick		yeah just a bit
2006-10-09T11:24:00.000Z	fick		wait a minute, is there a way to read a .iso image as if it was a cd drive
2006-10-09T11:25:00.000Z	fick		within ubuntu of course
2006-10-09T11:25:00.000Z	Dr_willis	fick	 you can mount an iso of course.
2006-10-09T11:25:00.000Z	Dr_willis	fick	 thats trivial
2006-10-09T11:25:00.000Z	Dr_willis	fick	 the feature has been in linux WAY WAY befor deamon tools even existed
2006-10-09T11:33:00.000Z	Dr_willis	fick	 put forth some effort man.. I am guessing you did some trivial thing wrong
2006-10-09T11:39:00.000Z	Dr_willis	fick	 the directory 'cd' does allready exist?
2006-10-09T11:40:00.000Z	Dr_willis	fick	-> sudo mkdir /media/cd
2006-10-09T11:41:00.000Z	Dr_willis	fick	 and whats the exact mount command you are using?
2006-10-09T11:44:00.000Z	Dr_willis	fick	 im thinking you are doing somthing fundamentally/logicially wrong.   its  i just mounted an .iso witht he following 2 commands.
2006-10-09T11:48:00.000Z	Dr_willis	fick	 my fstab dosent have those entrys.. the fstab should not be getting checked at all.
2006-10-09T11:48:00.000Z	Dr_willis	fick	 im betting you are doing somthing  wrong and when you realize it.. you will go " *doh*
2006-10-09T11:49:00.000Z	Dr_willis	fick	 Huh....
