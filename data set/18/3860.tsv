2009-09-03T12:45:00.000Z	bernardlychan		ok... so how do i set permissions to the folder?
2009-09-03T12:46:00.000Z	bernardlychan		so i cd to the file, then i type chmod 777?

2009-09-03T12:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	bernardlychan	its more secure to extract the files to home, you can then run: gksudo nautilus, copy the data over, then close nautilus
2009-09-03T12:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	bernardlychan	dont use 777 on anything, its the worst thing to do to any file or folder on a system
2009-09-03T12:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	bernardlychan	look into what it actually does and to whom it allows access
2009-09-03T12:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	bernardlychan	anyone in caps. literally ANYONE
2009-09-03T12:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	bernardlychan	like i said, run: gksudo nautilus and put the files where they need to go, if you need to only edit them you can run: gksudo gedit
2009-09-03T12:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	bernardlychan	if you dont have X then you will need sudo cp at command line
2009-09-03T12:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	bernardlychan	press alt+f2 and type the command
2009-09-03T12:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	bernardlychan	step very carefully with taht, its very powerful so watch what you do
2009-09-03T12:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	bernardlychan	keep its use to a minimum
2009-09-03T14:13:00.000Z	bernardlychan	ActionParsnip1	i know u r busy, but can u pleez help me?
2009-09-03T14:13:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	bernardlychan	ask the channel
