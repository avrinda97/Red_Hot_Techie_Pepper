2010-05-19T05:55:00.000Z	erghezi		i cant enable vsiual effects
2010-05-19T05:56:00.000Z	gartral	erghezi	you need a 3d acceleration driver
2010-05-19T05:56:00.000Z	erghezi	gartral	i install it! i use 195.36.24 nvidia driver
2010-05-19T05:57:00.000Z	gartral	erghezi	from repos or nvidia's site?
2010-05-19T05:57:00.000Z	erghezi	gartral	from nvidia site
2010-05-19T05:58:00.000Z	erghezi	gartral	from this guide: http://www.ubuntugeek.com/howto-install-nvidia-drivers-manually-on-ubuntu-10-04-lucid-lynx.html
2010-05-19T05:58:00.000Z	gartral	erghezi	THAT"S your problem, you just screwed yourself hard! reinstall from scratch and install the nvidia driver from hardware profiler
2010-05-19T05:59:00.000Z	erghezi	gartral	he he:))
2010-05-19T05:59:00.000Z	gartral	erghezi	see ya laters. the #ubuntu community has 0 support for installing any propriotary driver from the manufactuer's website
2010-05-19T06:00:00.000Z	erghezi	gartral	so can you tell me, how to remove it?
2010-05-19T06:00:00.000Z	gartral	erghezi	you've fucked you computer hard. I don't know a more blunt way to say it.. you need too reinstall ubuntu
2010-05-19T06:01:00.000Z	erghezi	gartral	but that's not solution ! i install ubuntu from alpha:(
2010-05-19T06:02:00.000Z	gartral	erghezi	well.. time to download the release iso.. once you've installed the nvidia drivers from their site, you make chankes that are irreperrable in the kernel.. there's no more blut a way to explain it, you've toasted ubuntu
2010-05-19T06:03:00.000Z	gartral	erghezi	perhaps next time you should read the warnings?
2010-05-19T06:04:00.000Z	gartral	erghezi	or.. petition nvidia to release drivers that dont suck... ohh.. wait.. we've been doing that for 15 years
2010-05-19T06:05:00.000Z	erghezi	gartral	i have a big bug. so I had to try it:(
2010-05-19T06:05:00.000Z	erghezi	gartral	https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nvidia-graphics-drivers-180/+bug/580167
2010-05-19T06:06:00.000Z	gartral	erghezi	i can garuntee, a reinstall now will fix 90% of your bugs. you're literally at the bottum of the barrel when it comes to bad positions, you've made the mistakeo f updating from alpha>beta>release, and THEN added a completly unsupportable driver too your system!
