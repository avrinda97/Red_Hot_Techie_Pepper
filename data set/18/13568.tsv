2006-06-07T16:01:00.000Z	r0xoR		how do i chmod a folder with the gid sticky bit set? what i want is for all files under a certain folder to be created with the same group permissions as the parent folder
2006-06-07T16:01:00.000Z	r0xoR		does that make sense?
2006-06-07T16:01:00.000Z	andi5	r0xoR	i think chmod g+s $dir
2006-06-07T16:02:00.000Z	andi5	r0xoR	but you know what gid sticky means, right :)
2006-06-07T16:04:00.000Z	r0xoR	andi5	not for certain no
2006-06-07T16:04:00.000Z	andi5	r0xoR	what do you want to achieve?
2006-06-07T16:04:00.000Z	r0xoR	andi5	i want to have a folder, inside of which, any other created file or folder has a particular group and has particular group permissions set
2006-06-07T16:04:00.000Z	r0xoR	andi5	for instance:
2006-06-07T16:05:00.000Z	r0xoR	andi5	if i have a folder called foo/ and foo has permissions of rw-rw-r
2006-06-07T16:05:00.000Z	r0xoR	andi5	i want all other files under foo/ such as foo/bar.txt to be created with the same group permissions
2006-06-07T16:05:00.000Z	r0xoR	andi5	i.e. read write in this example
2006-06-07T16:05:00.000Z	r0xoR	andi5	i also want to force all files to have the group that foo has
2006-06-07T16:08:00.000Z	andi5	r0xoR	the sticky bit should suffice to make newly created files have the same gid..... no idea about the permissions.... is there some "local umask"? ;-)
2006-06-07T16:09:00.000Z	r0xoR	andi5	i guess i'll have to set the umask then
2006-06-07T16:09:00.000Z	andi5	r0xoR	what file system? maybe you can make use of acls somehow?
2006-06-07T16:09:00.000Z	r0xoR	andi5	ext3
2006-06-07T16:10:00.000Z	andi5	r0xoR	play with ACLs, maybe they can help you :)
2006-06-07T16:10:00.000Z	andi5	r0xoR	i think they call it "extended attributes" or such, right?
