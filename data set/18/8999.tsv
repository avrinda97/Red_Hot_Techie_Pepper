2007-05-25T10:31:00.000Z	wjlroe		anybody have any idea how to get a SATA DVD drive working on a mixed IDE/SATA system?
2007-05-25T10:32:00.000Z	sipior	wjlroe	if it's plugged in to the sata controller, shouldn't work as  normal?
2007-05-25T10:32:00.000Z	wjlroe	sipior	no, doesn't - mplayer can't read it as a DVD driev
2007-05-25T10:32:00.000Z	wjlroe	sipior	but disks mount fine
2007-05-25T10:32:00.000Z	sipior	wjlroe	but is there a device file for it in /dev?
2007-05-25T10:33:00.000Z	wjlroe	sipior	year there's a dev there /dev/sr0
2007-05-25T10:33:00.000Z	sipior	wjlroe	mplayer may need to be told which device to look at
2007-05-25T10:33:00.000Z	sipior	wjlroe	and mplayer doesn't like that?
2007-05-25T10:33:00.000Z	wjlroe	sipior	it's looking at /dev/dvd which is sym linked to /dev/sr0
2007-05-25T10:33:00.000Z	wjlroe	sipior	no - say's there's no disk
2007-05-25T10:33:00.000Z	wjlroe	sipior	xine can't read it either
2007-05-25T10:34:00.000Z	sipior	wjlroe	and you're sure sr0 is the right device?
2007-05-25T10:34:00.000Z	wjlroe	sipior	yep
2007-05-25T10:34:00.000Z	wjlroe	sipior	it mounts CDs/DVDs ok
2007-05-25T10:34:00.000Z	wjlroe	sipior	just can't play them
2007-05-25T10:35:00.000Z	wjlroe	sipior	I've installed the CSS stuff, that is hush hush
2007-05-25T10:35:00.000Z	sipior	wjlroe	hmm...sorry, not sure what to tell you. you might try looking through the mplayer web site; see if this is a known issue
2007-05-25T10:35:00.000Z	wjlroe	sipior	ok, will do. Thanks. could be the make I suppose
