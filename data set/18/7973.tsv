2007-10-19T19:37:00.000Z	Sun_Paladin		is there a specific channel for problems that happened during upgrading?
2007-10-19T19:37:00.000Z	Vlet	Sun_Paladin	no
2007-10-19T19:38:00.000Z	Sun_Paladin	Vlet	do you know how to fix an upgrade that got shut off half way through?
2007-10-19T19:39:00.000Z	Vlet	Sun_Paladin	no. Does your system still run?
2007-10-19T19:40:00.000Z	Sun_Paladin	Vlet	no. everytime I try to run Ubuntu, it keeps showing the loading screen. I'm using Ubuntu on a laptop that is dual booted with Ubuntu and XP
2007-10-19T19:41:00.000Z	Vlet	Sun_Paladin	do you have anything that you need to get off ubuntu? You may be better off just doing a clean install if you can
2007-10-19T19:41:00.000Z	Sun_Paladin	Vlet	will the install CD help me do a clean install on that partition? or a better question can I choose the partition that it will install in?
2007-10-19T19:42:00.000Z	Vlet	Sun_Paladin	yeah, that's what the install CD is for :) When it comes time to partition, select manual, and change your ext3 partition's mount point to / instead of whatever it wants it to be
2007-10-19T19:43:00.000Z	Sun_Paladin	Vlet	and if I want to get some documents off of Ubuntu, how do I do that? I ran recovery mode and it said that I had to run dpkg or something manually
2007-10-19T19:44:00.000Z	Vlet	Sun_Paladin	oh, boot off the live cd (installer cd) and before you actually run the installer, you should be able to access your old ubuntu partition and copy things over to a thumb drive or whatever
2007-10-19T19:45:00.000Z	Sun_Paladin	Vlet	are there instructions on how to boot off the live Cd? when I start up my computer it goes into the dual boot screen and then I'm allowed to choose an operating system. Is the cd supposed to kick in before that?
2007-10-19T19:46:00.000Z	Vlet	Sun_Paladin	yeah, it should... you might have to adjust something in your bios. If the CD is in the drive, your computer should boot off it before it even tries to see what's on the hard drives
2007-10-19T19:47:00.000Z	Sun_Paladin	Vlet	okay, I will try that. thanks very much for the help.
2007-10-19T19:47:00.000Z	Vlet	Sun_Paladin	glad to :)
2007-10-20T01:45:00.000Z	Vlet	Sun_Paladin	no one wants to be TAKEN by one person. Ask your questions, and if anyone IN HERE knows the answer, they'll answer
2007-10-20T01:46:00.000Z	Sun_Paladin	Vlet	so do I just address my questions to a random person whenever I log in here?
2007-10-20T01:47:00.000Z	Vlet	Sun_Paladin	I'm pretty good with a lot of things, but I don't know much about grub, so if you ask for 'an expert' and I respond, it's wasting your time and mine
2007-10-20T01:47:00.000Z	Sun_Paladin	Vlet	okay, looking on the forums right now then, thanks for the info
