2010-10-05T01:20:00.000Z	uLinux		how can I make a program run without sudo? ie: sudo smartctl
2010-10-05T01:20:00.000Z	uLinux		chmod+x thing
2010-10-05T01:21:00.000Z	guntbert	uLinux	don't - system control should be done only as root
2010-10-05T01:21:00.000Z	uLinux	guntbert	I need to get temperature from smartctl
2010-10-23T00:29:00.000Z	guntbert	uLinux	unless you first "purge" the package config files are kept
2010-10-23T00:29:00.000Z	uLinux	guntbert	can i purge and reinstall at same time
2010-10-23T00:29:00.000Z	uLinux	guntbert	forget.. first i need to remove :p
2010-10-23T00:29:00.000Z	guntbert	uLinux	what do want to achieve?
2010-10-23T00:30:00.000Z	uLinux	guntbert	i want reinstall ALSA but removing the old configuration files
2010-10-23T00:31:00.000Z	guntbert	uLinux	I don't know about ALSA, but first you could try what muelli suggested above
2010-10-23T00:32:00.000Z	uLinux	guntbert	"sudo apt-get --purge remove linux-sound-base alsa-base alsa-utils" then "sudo apt-get install linux-sound-base alsa-base alsa-utils"
2010-10-23T00:33:00.000Z	guntbert	uLinux	I don't know about the dependencies, but I don't see anything wrong here
2010-10-23T00:39:00.000Z	guntbert	uLinux	ubuntu-desktop is only a meta package
2010-10-23T00:43:00.000Z	uLinux	guntbert	i've heard that but what is "meta package"?
2010-10-23T00:44:00.000Z	guntbert	uLinux	a package that contains no real prgrams, it only depends on a lot of real packages to pull them all in together - try aptitude show ubuntu-desktop
2010-10-23T00:50:00.000Z	uLinux	guntbert	thats kinda confusing "no real program" "depends on others"
2010-10-23T00:52:00.000Z	guntbert	uLinux	the package management system keeps track of "dependencies" - so if they want a way to pull in everything that is needed to form the regular ubuntu desktop they create a package that is dependent on all those other packages but brings no functionality on it's own
2010-10-23T00:53:00.000Z	uLinux	guntbert	ok
