2011-01-16T16:16:00.000Z	NeedsHelpWithFan	asyraff	have u tried powering off and on the device?
2011-01-16T16:16:00.000Z	NeedsHelpWithFan	asyraff	also, have u tried it on a windows machine?
2011-01-16T16:17:00.000Z	asyraff	NeedsHelpWithFan	if i turn off, it will detect my usb but if possible i dont want to restart my pc
2011-01-16T16:17:00.000Z	asyraff	NeedsHelpWithFan	yup...in windows machine...it detects my pendrive
2011-01-16T16:18:00.000Z	NeedsHelpWithFan	asyraff	have you checked if it is mounted on /media/?
2011-01-16T16:18:00.000Z	asyraff	NeedsHelpWithFan	hurm...its empty...
2011-01-16T16:20:00.000Z	NeedsHelpWithFan	asyraff	check System->Administration->Disk Utility
2011-01-16T16:20:00.000Z	NeedsHelpWithFan	asyraff	if your pendrive is there it should show up on the left pane
2011-01-16T16:21:00.000Z	NeedsHelpWithFan	asyraff	click on the disk to see if it is mounted, it may be detected but if it is not mounted you can't really access it or see it.
2011-01-16T16:21:00.000Z	asyraff	NeedsHelpWithFan	only hard disk and cd drive...
2011-01-16T16:21:00.000Z	NeedsHelpWithFan	asyraff	so when you plug it in, there is no response from ur machine at all?
2011-01-16T16:22:00.000Z	asyraff	NeedsHelpWithFan	yup...
2011-01-16T16:22:00.000Z	NeedsHelpWithFan	asyraff	you should check if the pen drive is encrypted in any way
2011-01-16T16:22:00.000Z	NeedsHelpWithFan	asyraff	what filesystem is the pendrive on?
2011-01-16T16:24:00.000Z	asyraff	NeedsHelpWithFan	i have 3 pendrive...fat32, ext4 and ntfs
2011-01-16T16:24:00.000Z	asyraff	NeedsHelpWithFan	soory...not ntfs...only fat
