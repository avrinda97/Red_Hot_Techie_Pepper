2011-10-16T09:56:00.000Z	kuru		anyone? I can't see the time and can't add it.. this is weird
2011-10-16T09:57:00.000Z	almoxarife	kuru	you have a bar without the time/date thing?
2011-10-16T09:58:00.000Z	kuru	almoxarife	correct.
2011-10-16T09:58:00.000Z	almoxarife	kuru	unity 2d?
2011-10-16T09:58:00.000Z	kuru	almoxarife	I don't think so.. this is unity proper if I'm not mistaken.
2011-10-16T09:59:00.000Z	kuru		How do I know/
2011-10-16T09:59:00.000Z	almoxarife	kuru	got the ?????? thing on the left? what is it called?
2011-10-16T10:02:00.000Z	kuru	almoxarife	I'm on unity proper.. not 2D
2011-10-16T10:04:00.000Z	almoxarife	kuru	I can't tell you how to perhaps return the date, but I am not sure it's a fix, open a terminal and type 'unity-2d-panel'  , if nothing gets clobbered you should have date/time where you would expect it, you can log out and back in afterwards to undo it
2011-10-16T10:05:00.000Z	almoxarife	kuru	'can tell you'
2011-10-16T10:05:00.000Z	kuru	almoxarife	ok, running that now.. it's just sitting there (complaining about other client alreadying reserving hotkeys it wants to use)
2011-10-16T10:07:00.000Z	kuru		I'm really getting annoyed with Ubuntu now.. ever since Unity.
2011-10-16T10:07:00.000Z	kuru		I'm okay with the panel.. I'm okay with the dash and all that other stuff
2011-10-16T10:07:00.000Z	kuru		I'm not against the concepts at all.. but jesus man.. let it be configurable.. or actually work.
2011-10-16T10:07:00.000Z	almoxarife	kuru	I use gnome with cairo dock, I gave up on trying to fix this and that,
2011-10-16T10:08:00.000Z	kuru		It appears to be more stable now in 11.10 but this date thing is annoying
2011-10-16T10:09:00.000Z	almoxarife	kuru	you did an upgrade to 11.10
2011-10-16T10:09:00.000Z	almoxarife	kuru	you did an upgrade to 11.10???
