2007-06-18T13:35:00.000Z	BlackChaos		can sum 1 hlp me ive been w8ting 4 hlp 4 a while now
2007-06-18T13:36:00.000Z	BlackChaos		 Your home directory listed as: /home/BlackChaosxxx, but does not appear to exist. do you want to log in with the /root directory as your home directory? it is unlikely anything will work unless you use a failsafe session, and it had the options of yes or no
2007-06-18T13:36:00.000Z	BlackChaos		so i said yes
2007-06-18T13:36:00.000Z	BlackChaos		than another error message came up here it is:
2007-06-18T13:36:00.000Z	BlackChaos		users $HOME/.dmrc file is being ignored. this prevents the default session and language from being saved. file should be owned by user and have 644 permission. users $HOME directory must be owned by user and not writable by other users
2007-06-18T13:37:00.000Z	Flannel	BlackChaos	what did you do before you got this error?
2007-06-18T13:39:00.000Z	Flannel	BlackChaos	why'd you do that?
2007-06-18T13:41:00.000Z	Flannel	BlackChaos	Well, you changed where your user was looking for it's home stuff, but you didn't change where thehome stuff actually was.  That's why you're having problems.  Changing it back will fix it, or moving your old homedir to where it's currently looking.  I'd suggest changing the homedir back over renaming it, since it's usual for homedirs to be /home/username, and moving it back would be that
2007-06-18T13:42:00.000Z	Flannel	BlackChaos	sure.  You're at a root terminal right now?
2007-06-18T13:43:00.000Z	Flannel	BlackChaos	`usermod -d /home/jayxxx jayxxx`  Assuming your username is 'jayxxx' and that's also the folder (remember it's case sensitive)
2007-06-18T13:45:00.000Z	Flannel	BlackChaos	Er... Are you sure?
2007-06-18T13:45:00.000Z	Flannel	BlackChaos	did you change that? or something?
2007-06-18T13:47:00.000Z	Flannel	BlackChaos	if that's the case, why was it originally jayxxx?
2007-06-18T13:49:00.000Z	Flannel	BlackChaos	Alright.  Gotcha.  All you have left to do is move your homedir.  from /home/jayxxx to /home/blackchaosxxx or whatever.
2007-06-18T13:51:00.000Z	Flannel	BlackChaos	`mv /home/jayxxx /home/blackchaosxxx`
2007-06-18T13:51:00.000Z	Flannel	BlackChaos	you renamed your user, correct?  So all the files in /home/jayxxx are owned by blackchaosxxx currently?
2007-06-18T13:53:00.000Z	Flannel	BlackChaos	riht, now you just need to move the folder to the new one.
2007-06-18T13:53:00.000Z	Flannel	BlackChaos	yeah.  mv is MoVe
