2007-11-30T18:39:00.000Z	MasterShrek	Andycasss	for a server? i always used proftpd
2007-11-30T18:39:00.000Z	MasterShrek	Andycasss	gftp?
2007-11-30T18:40:00.000Z	Andycasss	MasterShrek	no, i wanna use pureftpd
2007-11-30T18:40:00.000Z	MasterShrek	Andycasss	gftp as a client
2007-11-30T18:41:00.000Z	Andycasss	MasterShrek	Well, it doesnt quite matter which client im using, as im planning to give access to other users and they might use smartftp
2007-11-30T21:06:00.000Z	MasterShrek	Andycasss	probably in the .conf file for it, i konw proftpd is that way
2007-11-30T21:06:00.000Z	Andycasss	MasterShrek	Couldnt find any .conf file, are you sure youre not confusing it with proftpd?
2007-11-30T21:07:00.000Z	MasterShrek	Andycasss	well im just going off of what i know from proftpd, i would assume theres a pureftpd config file somewhere
2008-01-17T19:51:00.000Z	MasterShrek	Andycasss	im sure there is
2008-02-01T21:24:00.000Z	MasterShrek	Andycasss	do you have a dns server on that machine? if not you can probably remove it
2008-02-01T21:26:00.000Z	Andycasss	MasterShrek	i do have a dyndns updater on my system, but i dont know anything about dns server
2008-02-01T21:26:00.000Z	MasterShrek	Andycasss	is your system acting as a router?
2008-02-01T21:27:00.000Z	Andycasss	MasterShrek	no, it acts as a server
2008-02-01T21:27:00.000Z	MasterShrek	Andycasss	because if its not, i dont think dyndns needs to be on that, i think dyndns is supposed to be on your router, could be wrong though
2008-02-01T21:27:00.000Z	MasterShrek	Andycasss	unless you dont have a router i guess...
2008-02-01T21:28:00.000Z	Andycasss	MasterShrek	no i need the dyndns to update nameservers so that people can connect on my dynamic ip
2008-02-01T21:29:00.000Z	MasterShrek	Andycasss	i do the same thing, but its set up in my router not on my server
2008-02-01T21:29:00.000Z	MasterShrek	Andycasss	but i dont even know if thats your problem, it might not even be the dns part of the shutdown that its hanging on, but rather wahtever is after it
