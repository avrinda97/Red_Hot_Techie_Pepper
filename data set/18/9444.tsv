2007-08-10T16:22:00.000Z	MenZa	foug	simple
2007-08-10T16:22:00.000Z	MenZa	foug	Which bin is this?
2007-08-10T16:22:00.000Z	foug	MenZa	google earth, i thought chmod a+x was how to install bin's
2007-08-10T16:22:00.000Z	MenZa	foug	first chmox +x the file, then ./filename
2007-08-10T16:23:00.000Z	foug	MenZa	chmox a+x google.bin   <>  ./google.bin?
2007-08-10T16:23:00.000Z	MenZa	foug	correct
2007-08-10T16:23:00.000Z	MenZa	foug	but as cafuego states, maybe using a .deb is better
2007-08-10T16:23:00.000Z	MenZa	foug	Use his package
2007-08-10T16:24:00.000Z	foug	MenZa	chmox, command not found.
2007-08-10T16:24:00.000Z	MenZa	foug	no, chmod +x
2007-08-10T16:24:00.000Z	MenZa	foug	but instead
2007-08-10T16:24:00.000Z	MenZa	foug	rm google.bin
2007-08-10T16:24:00.000Z	MenZa	foug	then wget http://ubuntu.cafuego.net/pool/feisty-cafuego/google/googleearth_4.1.7076.4458-0cafuego3_i386.deb
2007-08-10T16:28:00.000Z	MenZa	foug	then sudo dpkg -i http://ubuntu.cafuego.net/pool/feisty-cafuego/google/googleearth_4.1.7076.4458-0cafuego3_i386.deb
2007-08-10T16:28:00.000Z	MenZa	foug	sudo dpkg -i /googleearth_4.1.7076.4458-0cafuego3_i386.deb
2007-08-10T16:28:00.000Z	foug	MenZa	cafuego: I got the bin working, what does chmod mean? i could have sworn it was a+x, someone told me it was all users + execute
