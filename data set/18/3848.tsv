2009-07-19T12:17:00.000Z	bonko56		how do I get ubuntu to mount a usb hard drive ?
2009-07-19T12:19:00.000Z	losher	bonko56	it should be autodetected. Can you plug it in & then run dmesg?
2009-07-19T12:21:00.000Z	losher	bonko56	yes, dmesg via terminal. The last few lines should tell you if the kernel sees the usb drive. You can paste it to http://paste.ubuntu.com for us to look at
2009-07-19T12:25:00.000Z	losher	bonko56	no need to paste it. Try googling the error message. I don't recognise it, offhand...
2009-07-19T12:26:00.000Z	losher	bonko56	btw, what version of OS are you running?
2009-07-19T12:28:00.000Z	losher	bonko56	you need to tell us the url of the paste...
2009-07-19T12:30:00.000Z	losher	bonko56	actually, it looks like it worked, and your device is /dev/sdc1. Can you sudo fsck /dev/sdc1 ?
2009-07-19T12:34:00.000Z	losher	bonko56	did you type it correctly? sudo fsck /dev/sdc1  (not sdk1)
2009-07-19T12:45:00.000Z	losher	bonko56	please type fdisk -l /dev/sdc
2009-07-19T12:45:00.000Z	losher	bonko56	please type sudo fdisk -l /dev/sdc  (forgot the sudo)
2009-07-19T12:51:00.000Z	losher	bonko56	is the usb drive on the machine you just rebooted?
2009-07-19T12:54:00.000Z	losher	bonko56	that's how it should work. So what's different about this machine? Yes, it's a lowercase L in the fdisk command....
2009-07-19T12:55:00.000Z	bonko56	losher	I dunno its got me tearing my hair out lol some machines it just mounts, the machine on which it wont load is an IBM laptop an old P3 machine
2009-07-19T12:57:00.000Z	losher	bonko56	I wonder if the fact that it's old hardware means there something different about the usb ports. version 1.1 vs. 2.0?
2009-07-19T12:58:00.000Z	losher	bonko56	but there are other machines on which it *is* readable?
2009-07-19T12:59:00.000Z	bonko56	losher	yes it works fine on a win box and on two other ubuntu boxes
2009-07-19T13:01:00.000Z	losher	bonko56	well back to where we were before you rebooted, what does dmesg say about it? Same as last time i.e. device sdc ?
2009-07-19T13:08:00.000Z	losher	bonko56	still there?
