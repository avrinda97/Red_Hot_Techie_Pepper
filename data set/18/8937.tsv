2007-06-03T13:48:00.000Z	LjL	DevoutFollowerOf	don't spam please
2007-06-03T14:02:00.000Z	LjL	DevoutFollowerOf	you've been answered, seveal times, no i suggest you try what has been suggested and stop making irrelevant comments.
2007-06-03T14:17:00.000Z	LjL	DevoutFollowerOf	i can't help you with the Windows CD, but from the Ubuntu CD there is a package called "ms-sys" that can be installed and run to restore a Microsoft-compatible bootloader.
2007-06-03T14:24:00.000Z	LjL	DevoutFollowerOf	1) enable universe 2)  sudo apt-get install ms-sys  3)  man ms-sys 
2007-06-03T14:24:00.000Z	DevoutFollowerOf	LjL	that didn't help at all
2007-06-03T14:26:00.000Z	LjL	DevoutFollowerOf	after you have it enabled, type the exact commands i've given you in a terminal
2007-06-03T14:27:00.000Z	LjL	DevoutFollowerOf	that's your problem, not ours. next time buy it
2007-06-03T14:28:00.000Z	LjL	DevoutFollowerOf	you should have had a backup.
