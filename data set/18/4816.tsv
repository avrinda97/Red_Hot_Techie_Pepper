2009-03-08T04:50:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mikeshollen	ok yeah  tunneld VNC over SSH,  or it's insecure when your using the net
2009-03-08T04:51:00.000Z	mikeshollen	sebsebseb	Would you go into further detail?
2009-03-08T04:51:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mikeshollen	you need commands and a SSH account
2009-03-08T04:52:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mikeshollen	as well as x11vnc and openssh-server installed
2009-03-08T04:52:00.000Z	mikeshollen	sebsebseb	so in order to use VNC outside of my local network, I need SSH?
2009-03-08T04:52:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mikeshollen	to make it secure,  you need to tunnel it over SSH
2009-03-08T04:52:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mikeshollen	the Internet is not secure
2009-03-08T04:53:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mikeshollen	makes it encrypted
2009-03-08T04:53:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mikeshollen	I guess not
2009-03-08T04:54:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mikeshollen	the I guess not was to the netbook guy
2009-03-08T04:56:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mikeshollen	PM me and I can tell you things about VNC over SSH a lot of stuff to tell you
2009-03-08T04:56:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mikeshollen	so don't want to like take over the channel with it
2009-03-10T04:40:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mikeshollen	lol  ok
2009-03-10T04:40:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mikeshollen	 you can use a Linux anti virus program to  scan  a Linux install as well as Wine for Windows viruses
2009-03-10T04:40:00.000Z	mikeshollen	sebsebseb	correct, and AVG is a linux antivirus
2009-03-10T04:41:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mikeshollen	you don't need an antivirus really for wine though, Windows viruses don't tend to work properly in wine if at all
2009-03-10T05:15:00.000Z	sebsebseb	mikeshollen	software is called packages in Linux
