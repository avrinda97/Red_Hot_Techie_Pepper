2008-05-01T07:04:00.000Z	hustl_		I just recieved my dell inspiron 1525, first time running ubuntu (or linux for that matter). I was wondering if there is a way to add larger resolutions in system->preferences->screen resolution
2008-05-01T07:04:00.000Z	amirman84	hustl_	how high does it go?
2008-05-01T07:04:00.000Z	hustl_	amirman84	1280x800
2008-05-01T07:05:00.000Z	hustl_	amirman84	little to big for me :p
2008-05-01T07:05:00.000Z	amirman84	hustl_	oh, that might be as high as your screen can handle
2008-05-01T07:05:00.000Z	hustl_	amirman84	really?
2008-05-01T07:05:00.000Z	amirman84	hustl_	you can always just edit your theme to make stuff smaller
2008-05-01T07:06:00.000Z	hustl_	amirman84	true
2008-05-01T07:06:00.000Z	amirman84	hustl_	i'm not sure, but i have a dell inspiron e1505 laptop and 1280x800 is the highest it goes
2008-05-01T07:06:00.000Z	hustl_	amirman84	 ok, thanks for the help
2008-05-01T07:07:00.000Z	amirman84	hustl_	i'm glad i helped :)

2008-05-01T07:08:00.000Z	amirman84		has anybody in here ever seen an error displayed when trying to hibernate that says *ERROR* pat entry 2 is already configured ?

2008-05-01T07:10:00.000Z	hustl_	amirman84	why, everytime I launch add/remove applications, does it say that my list of applications is out of date?
2008-05-01T07:11:00.000Z	hustl_	amirman84	 if I launch it now, update it, close it, then relaunch it right away it says the same thing
2008-05-01T07:11:00.000Z	amirman84		algorithmicContr: the version of firefox that comes with hardy is the newest beta, there are still a lot of extentions that aren't compatible with it, if you are the tweaking and hacking adventuresom sort i can find an article i read that tells you how you can get a lot of them to work anyway...
2008-05-01T07:12:00.000Z	amirman84	hustl_	usually when you add new repos, it makes you update, but i have no idea why it would keep saying it after you update
