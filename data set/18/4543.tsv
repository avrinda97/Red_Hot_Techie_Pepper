2009-07-28T21:13:00.000Z	nsahoo		if firefox says for an URL "Server not found" does it mean the remote site is down or does it mean that there is some issue with the DNS lookup?
2009-07-28T21:13:00.000Z	grawity	nsahoo	"Not found" generally means the DNS lookup didn't return a valid address. Try the command 'host some.host.com' on terminal.

2009-07-28T21:16:00.000Z	grawity	nsahoo	they seem to have a problem with their DNS server.
2009-07-28T21:16:00.000Z	nsahoo	grawity	thanks for verifying that for me
2009-08-15T23:31:00.000Z	grawity	nsahoo	That is something outside the capabilities of a shell. You might manage to do something like that with chroot, or AppArmor, but generally this isn't an easy thing to do. Why do you want to do t his, anyway?
2009-08-15T23:31:00.000Z	grawity	nsahoo	Normal Linux file permissions restrict writing to homedir and /tmp, anyway.
2009-08-15T23:31:00.000Z	nsahoo	grawity	trying to run a program that is possibly rouge
2009-08-15T23:31:00.000Z	grawity	nsahoo	Writing an AppArmor profile might help.
2009-08-15T23:32:00.000Z	nsahoo	grawity	so, I should create another user and run it as that?
2009-08-15T23:32:00.000Z	grawity	nsahoo	Yes, another user would be the easiest way to do it. (You could even try using the existing one -- 'nobody')
2009-08-15T23:33:00.000Z	nsahoo	grawity	didn't know of nobody, does it have a random password or something? why is this user there? for temporary user needs?
2009-08-15T23:34:00.000Z	grawity	nsahoo	It doesn't have any password. It is mostly designed for daemons. (Though most of them get their own accounts nowadays.)
2009-08-15T23:35:00.000Z	grawity	nsahoo	You might try 'sudo -u nobody -i' to get a shell running as 'nobody'.
2009-08-15T23:37:00.000Z	nsahoo	grawity	thanks, that worked out very well. I was probably being too careful.
2009-10-30T18:56:00.000Z	grawity	nsahoo	Do you have DejaVu fonts? (If I recall correctly, DejaVu ones are just extended Bitstream Vera.)
2009-10-30T18:57:00.000Z	nsahoo	grawity	i have those, let me try using them
2009-10-30T18:58:00.000Z	nsahoo	grawity	i guess they are fine
