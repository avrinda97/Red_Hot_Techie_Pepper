2012-05-27T04:53:00.000Z	wawowe	forrest__	hit f6 in alsamixer and unmute with >
2012-05-27T04:54:00.000Z	forrest__		Thank you.
2012-05-27T05:05:00.000Z	forrest__	wawowe	I disabled Auto-Mute Mode in alsamixer but I still have no HDMI audio output. Was that what I was supposed to do?
2012-05-27T05:07:00.000Z	wawowe	forrest__	mplayer -ao alsa:device=hw=1.3 audio.mp3
2012-05-27T05:11:00.000Z	forrest__	wawowe	Do I paste that some where? Sorry I'm still learning.
2012-05-27T05:12:00.000Z	wawowe	forrest__	as a test: apt-get install mplayer
2012-05-27T05:12:00.000Z	wawowe	forrest__	mplayer -ao alsa:device=hw=1.3 someaudiofile.mp3
2012-05-27T05:13:00.000Z	wawowe	forrest__	run those in terminal
2012-05-27T05:13:00.000Z	forrest__		Okay, thanks. Installing now.
2012-05-27T05:17:00.000Z	wawowe	forrest__	ctrl+alt+t
2012-05-27T05:26:00.000Z	forrest__	wawowe	I installed mplayer but the second part failed I think. Was it supposed to play the audio file through HDMI?
2012-05-27T05:28:00.000Z	wawowe	forrest__	yes
2012-05-27T05:29:00.000Z	wawowe	forrest__	echo "autospawn = no" > ~/.pulse/client.conf && killall pulseaudio
2012-05-27T05:33:00.000Z	forrest__	wawowe	I ran that in terminal. I didn't see or hear anything. What was supposed to happen?
2012-05-27T05:34:00.000Z	wawowe	forrest__	nothing. now run mplayer -ao alsa:device=hw=1.3 yourmusic.mp3
2012-05-27T05:43:00.000Z	forrest__	wawowe	I keep trying different audio files but its not able to find them or that it cannot connect to socket.
2012-05-27T05:47:00.000Z	wawowe	forrest__	paste this in ~/.asoundrc : http://paste.ubuntu.com/1009012/
