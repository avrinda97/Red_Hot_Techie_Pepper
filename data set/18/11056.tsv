2006-09-22T14:43:00.000Z	HOT		so, whats the difference between xgl and aiglx? is it worth "upgrading" ?
2006-09-22T14:44:00.000Z	eyequeue	HOT	eye candy and breakage
2006-09-22T15:00:00.000Z	eyequeue	HOT	wrong channel though :)
2006-09-22T15:24:00.000Z	eyequeue	HOT	yes, debian/ubuntu has adduser, a bit simpler syntax :)
2006-09-25T16:32:00.000Z	eyequeue	HOT	ntpdate?
2006-09-25T16:33:00.000Z	HOT	eyequeue	not good enough i am afraid
2006-09-25T16:33:00.000Z	eyequeue	HOT	oh well, the only idea i had
2006-09-25T16:33:00.000Z	HOT	eyequeue	i am asking bristol university if i can borrow some atomic devices for ntp calibration
2006-09-25T16:36:00.000Z	HOT	eyequeue	the problem i face is nics have a slightly different "tick tock" rate in the tcp stack, so asking a machine what network time it is, comes across as meaningless
2006-09-25T16:37:00.000Z	eyequeue	HOT	yeah, i can see that.  seeing how to get past it though, i'm not good enough for :/
2006-09-25T16:37:00.000Z	eyequeue	HOT	i can also see the challenges there must be a lot of fun, if you're the type :)  even though frustrating
2006-09-25T16:40:00.000Z	eyequeue	HOT	i'll presume bristol means .uk, is there perhaps anything useful out of nasa.gov on time issues?
2006-09-25T16:41:00.000Z	HOT	eyequeue	bristol have some atomic calibration devices they can use to get down to pico alignment, from what i understand it measures its own time reference using atomic decay, very accurate stuff
2006-09-25T16:42:00.000Z	eyequeue	HOT	cool.  i was just wondering of the cluster folk at nasa might have written some tips based on their travails, heh
2006-09-25T16:43:00.000Z	HOT	eyequeue	i will look into that actually, currently i am speaking to the guy that looks after stratum devices at BrI, he seems to know his stuff but he agrees its voodoo, not so much defining a point in time over the lan but stopping drift
2006-09-25T16:44:00.000Z	eyequeue	HOT	yeah, not deprecating what you have a bristol at all mind you, just thinking that sometimes an alternate perspective sometimes sheds light :)
2006-09-25T16:44:00.000Z	HOT	eyequeue	the current solution floated as i understand it, is a kind of token ring using fibre, but its dedicated to time "pulses" and nothing else
2006-09-25T16:55:00.000Z	eyequeue	HOT	clever :)
