2010-02-10T04:40:00.000Z	KittyBoots		I am having significant trouble keeping grub in order.  I am dual booting Ubuntu and Windows 7.  After I use Windows and restart, grub reports that it cant start the system.  Then I boot into a live Ubuntu distro, and restart and grub works. Windows is doing something wierd with my harddrive.  I don't know how to fix this.
2010-02-10T04:41:00.000Z	Jordan_U	KittyBoots	What is the exact error you get from grub?
2010-02-10T04:43:00.000Z	KittyBoots	Jordan_U	It is working now, I can't recreate the error now.
2010-02-10T04:43:00.000Z	Jordan_U	KittyBoots	Can remember any part of the error?
2010-02-10T04:44:00.000Z	KittyBoots	Jordan_U	something about not having a bootable medium
2010-02-10T04:45:00.000Z	Jordan_U	KittyBoots	Ok, that's an error from the BIOS, which means that you aren't even getting to grub for some reason
2010-02-10T04:45:00.000Z	KittyBoots	Jordan_U	no it was after the post, it was a message from grub.
2010-02-10T04:46:00.000Z	Jordan_U	KittyBoots	GRUB never gives an error like that, and the BIOS looks for a drive to boot from after POST
2010-02-10T04:47:00.000Z	Jordan_U	KittyBoots	Does your computer have some "media boot" or "recovery partition" feature?
2010-02-10T04:47:00.000Z	KittyBoots	Jordan_U	I was a message from grub, but since I cant recreate it I will just wait until it happens again and come back here with it.
2010-02-10T04:48:00.000Z	KittyBoots	Jordan_U	Yes there is a recovery partition.
2010-02-10T04:48:00.000Z	Jordan_U	KittyBoots	Why are you so sure it was a message from grub? I have worked with the grub2 source and there is no error message like that.
2010-02-10T04:49:00.000Z	Jordan_U	KittyBoots	The closest thing would probably be "device not found"
2010-02-10T04:50:00.000Z	KittyBoots	Jordan_U	I am trying to recall it from memory I didn't write it down and I am not sure exactly what it was, I just would not boot.
2010-07-18T06:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U	KittyBoots	You do not need to do any compiling to get a broadcom card working, stop following whatever guide you're following.
2010-07-18T06:26:00.000Z	KittyBoots	Jordan_U	the card does not work and I can not connect through the wired connection.
2010-07-18T06:27:00.000Z	KittyBoots	Jordan_U	I do not know how to cure this.
2010-07-18T06:28:00.000Z	KittyBoots	Jordan_U	If the wired connection would work I would not have any troubles.
