2006-01-28T11:14:00.000Z	zeb		i really need some help
2006-01-28T11:15:00.000Z	frogzoo	zeb	- just leap in - don't ask
2006-01-28T11:16:00.000Z	frogzoo	zeb	- first get the h/w config right - make sure you have the slave/master jumpers set properly
2006-01-28T11:16:00.000Z	frogzoo	zeb	- k - I take it your primary drive is master on ide channel 1 - ie hda ?
2006-01-28T11:17:00.000Z	frogzoo	zeb	- and the 2nd drive is on the same ide cable?
2006-01-28T11:18:00.000Z	frogzoo	zeb	- now pastebin the results of 'sudo fdisk -l /dev/hdb'
2006-01-28T11:20:00.000Z	frogzoo	zeb	- do you want to keep the data on the drive? what do you plan to use the drive for?
2006-01-28T11:20:00.000Z	frogzoo	zeb	& doze uses it as just one partition? how's it formatted, ntfs ?
2006-01-28T11:21:00.000Z	frogzoo	zeb	well now for the bad news - linux can't write to ntfs partitions - read only I'm afraid
2006-01-28T11:24:00.000Z	frogzoo	zeb	read that link ^^^
2006-01-28T11:27:00.000Z	frogzoo	zeb	did you read the link?
2006-01-28T11:27:00.000Z	frogzoo	zeb	- this link
2006-01-28T11:29:00.000Z	frogzoo	zeb	oh, there's a script  - should make it easy - just do what it says, line by line - start with 'cd
2006-01-28T11:32:00.000Z	frogzoo	zeb	how you getting along there?
2006-01-28T11:32:00.000Z	frogzoo	zeb	well that's progress :)
2006-01-28T11:33:00.000Z	frogzoo	zeb	- now, like it says in the doc 'sudo bash diskmounter
2006-01-28T11:34:00.000Z	frogzoo	zeb	- what the script did was make some changes to the file /etc/fstab - might be worth a look to see what the script did
