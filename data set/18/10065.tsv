2007-10-02T10:52:00.000Z	Pici	Innomen	Theres a checkbox on the download page on ubuntu.com for the alternate cd.
2007-10-02T11:02:00.000Z	Pici	Innomen	Whats confusing?
2007-10-02T11:03:00.000Z	Pici	Innomen	Not if you are unsure what the command is.  either `/msg ubotu` to figure out the right syntax or dont.
2007-10-02T11:04:00.000Z	Pici	Innomen	Yes. but dont spam 5 !factoids at one person either, thats annoying.  Not that I saw this, but just in general.
2007-10-04T10:21:00.000Z	Pici	Innomen	Calm down.  You need to tell us either what you don't understand or where the document differs from your situation.
2007-10-11T05:42:00.000Z	Pici	Innomen	You said you had a problem with resolution.
2007-10-12T08:38:00.000Z	Pici	Innomen	6 months
2007-10-15T06:10:00.000Z	Pici	Innomen	I actually just rebooted, and I am going off to get some food, sorry.
