If that doesn't work, hard reset the router whilst doing the same thing, during the time you have the computer rebooting.
2008-12-05T13:55:00.000Z	Name1411	Lord`Saladin	Why did it just show up in the new release? I was thinking this was the time to switch.
2008-12-05T13:56:00.000Z	Name1411	Lord`Saladin	The BAM, stupid problem again
2008-12-05T13:56:00.000Z	Lord`Saladin	Name1411	I have no idea. I don't think it is an 8.10 issue - I had it in 8.04.
2008-12-05T13:57:00.000Z	Name1411	Lord`Saladin	I haven't seen it before when I installed Wubi , or the real deal
2008-12-05T13:57:00.000Z	Name1411	Lord`Saladin	Until this version
2008-12-05T13:58:00.000Z	Name1411	Lord`Saladin	So you are saying for me to try to disconnect the cable, put it back in? reset my modem and the router?
2008-12-05T13:59:00.000Z	Lord`Saladin	Name1411	Just take the ethernet out before shutting down Ubuntu. Restart the computer. Once you have logged back into Ubuntu, put the ethernet cable back in. That should work for you.
2008-12-05T13:59:00.000Z	Name1411	Lord`Saladin	So when I go to reboot to Ubuntu right now, I should have it out.  Wait till I get to the desktop, and put it back in , see if it worked?
2008-12-05T14:00:00.000Z	Name1411	Lord`Saladin	BRB
2008-12-05T14:06:00.000Z	Name1411	Lord`Saladin	That still didn't solve the issue.
2008-12-05T14:06:00.000Z	Name1411	Lord`Saladin	Maybe next release.. *sigh*
2008-12-05T14:11:00.000Z	Lord`Saladin	Name1411	I don't know, in that case. Did you try rebooting your router/modem?
2008-12-05T14:13:00.000Z	Name1411	Lord`Saladin	yes, it just twinkled again and said "connecting"
2008-12-05T14:13:00.000Z	Name1411	Lord`Saladin	roger.
2008-12-05T14:14:00.000Z	Name1411	Lord`Saladin	Are security updates still given to the earlier release? whatever LTS
2008-12-05T14:15:00.000Z	Name1411	Lord`Saladin	So in general, I could install 8.04 without any issues ?
2008-12-05T14:16:00.000Z	Lord`Saladin	Name1411	Nope. By default, LTS versions only notify you of LTS releases
