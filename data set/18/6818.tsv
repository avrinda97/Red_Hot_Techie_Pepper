2008-03-20T10:32:00.000Z	howdyho		Oh shit you guys I erased everything in my gnome.desktop file by mistake
2008-03-20T10:34:00.000Z	howdyho		No no.. I played around with it 10 mins ago
2008-03-20T10:34:00.000Z	howdyho		Now I opened it and it's blank
2008-03-20T10:35:00.000Z	howdyho		I have no idea
2008-03-20T10:35:00.000Z	howdyho		I opened it up in notepad and it was gone
2008-03-20T10:35:00.000Z	howdyho		or whatever the ubuntu equivelant is

2008-03-20T10:38:00.000Z	Stroganoff	howdyho	did you use sudo to open that file?
2008-03-20T10:12:00.000Z	Stroganoff	howdyho	have you looked into System->Preferences->More Preferences->Sessions
2008-03-20T10:16:00.000Z	Stroganoff	howdyho	the same for you
2008-03-20T10:17:00.000Z	Stroganoff	howdyho	http://pastebin.se/193876 thats the basic structure of a sessions file. instead of xterm you want "enlightment" or "enlightment-session" or something
2008-03-20T10:23:00.000Z	howdyho	Stroganoff	I can't write anything to /usr/share/xsessions
2008-03-20T10:35:00.000Z	Stroganoff	howdyho	how have you managed that
2008-03-20T10:35:00.000Z	Stroganoff	howdyho	it dazzles me
