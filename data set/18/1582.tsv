2011-01-14T23:12:00.000Z	bluezone		When attempting to install nvidia drivers on my new kernal ( i was warned buy sam-_- that it may not work xD) but anyhow it says "The distribution-provided pre-install script has failed!, and it fails after that, It also tells me i already have a driver installed however i do not have one installed, any ideas?
2011-01-14T23:13:00.000Z	lynxomania	bluezone	i also used to get that error while installing nvidia drivers!!! but i'd just ignore it and continue... things always worked for me... are you not able to finish the installation
2011-01-14T23:14:00.000Z	bluezone	lynxomania	wait ill try again
2011-01-14T23:17:00.000Z	lynxomania	bluezone	progress???
2011-01-14T23:18:00.000Z	bluezone	lynxomania	it also gives me an error about a CC version check and missing kernel source header
2011-01-14T23:18:00.000Z	bluezone	lynxomania	and then it fails
2011-01-14T23:18:00.000Z	lynxomania	bluezone	which version of linux and which kernel you're using??
2011-01-14T23:19:00.000Z	bluezone	lynxomania	2.6.36-020636-generic and 10.10
2011-01-14T23:20:00.000Z	bluezone	lynxomania	yes, that still results in not being able to change my resolution because it doesn't detect my monitor
2011-01-14T23:21:00.000Z	bluezone	lynxomania	i'm stuck at 800 by 600 right now
2011-01-14T23:22:00.000Z	lynxomania	bluezone	i suppose you are not able to change the resolution via the nvidia x server settings option in system>administration???
2011-01-14T23:22:00.000Z	bluezone	lynxomania	exactly
2011-01-14T23:23:00.000Z	lynxomania	bluezone	laptop/notebook/desktop ???
2011-01-14T23:24:00.000Z	bluezone	lynxomania	laptop, nVidia Corporation G86 [GeForce 8400M GS]
2011-01-14T23:28:00.000Z	bluezone	lynxomania	ideas? xD
2011-01-14T23:31:00.000Z	bluezone	lynxomania	there is nothing in that file
2011-01-14T23:35:00.000Z	lynxomania	bluezone	i suggest you copy and paste the xconf data from the second post in http://forums.nvidia.com/index.php?showtopic=35796 to your empty xconf... i'm sure it will work...
2011-01-14T23:37:00.000Z	bluezone	lynxomania	so now i restart?
