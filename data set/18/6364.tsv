2008-05-22T18:16:00.000Z	unr3a1		anybody?
2008-05-22T18:17:00.000Z	unr3a1		but why does the LiveCD work better than actually installing the OS?
2008-05-22T18:18:00.000Z	techsolo	unr3a1	because the live cd probebly runs less services
2008-05-22T18:18:00.000Z	unr3a1	techsolo	why would the LiveCD allow hardware to be recognized and then the install doesnt?
2008-05-22T18:26:00.000Z	unr3a1	techsolo	so how do I install the OS with the same configuration as the LiveCD?
2008-05-22T18:29:00.000Z	unr3a1	techsolo	at this point I dont care if it is easy or not.  I just need Ubuntu to work, and right now its not
2008-05-22T18:29:00.000Z	techsolo	unr3a1	all right you askes for it :) Just make the partitions manually and mount them as root
2008-05-22T18:32:00.000Z	techsolo	unr3a1	Then you make a tar file of / on the lice cd. Something like tar cvpf ï»¿--exclude /mnt/*partition*/ubuntu.tar /mnt/*partition*/ubuntu.tar /
2008-05-22T18:36:00.000Z	unr3a1	techsolo	then just untar it, correct?
2008-05-22T18:36:00.000Z	techsolo	unr3a1	with the -C /mnt/*destination option yes
2008-05-22T18:39:00.000Z	unr3a1	techsolo	and thats it?
2008-05-22T18:40:00.000Z	techsolo	unr3a1	Then it just untar the live / tree to your mounted destination file recursivly
2008-05-22T18:41:00.000Z	techsolo	unr3a1	don't forget to install grub manually now
2008-05-22T18:44:00.000Z	unr3a1	techsolo	anything else?
2008-05-22T18:45:00.000Z	techsolo	unr3a1	nope :) yeah configure grub the wrigt way and make a menu.lst file. But I think you know that
2008-05-22T18:58:00.000Z	techsolo	unr3a1	my pleasure
2008-05-22T19:14:00.000Z	unr3a1	techsolo	I just realized... do I need to manually compile the kernel?
2008-05-22T19:15:00.000Z	techsolo	unr3a1	why should you do that? The live cd all ready has a kernel. You wan't it to work just like a live cd
