2011-08-20T17:47:00.000Z	edbian	kinglet	that is strange.  All I can see is try again! :P
2011-08-20T17:48:00.000Z	kinglet	edbian	I can't understand! I download Ubuntu for 3 times :( but same problem
2011-08-20T17:48:00.000Z	kinglet	edbian	I want to know what is the problem when the Md5sum doesnt match?
2011-08-20T17:48:00.000Z	edbian	kinglet	I do not know.  Are you looking at the correct md5sum on the web page?
2011-08-20T17:49:00.000Z	kinglet	edbian	yes, C:\Users\Kinglet\Documents\My downloads>md5sum ubuntu-11.04-des
2011-08-20T17:49:00.000Z	kinglet	edbian	and C:\Users\Kinglet\Documents\My downloads>md5sum ubuntu-10.04.3-des
2011-08-20T17:49:00.000Z	edbian	kinglet	It means some of the bits from the download were changed (from hardware error) or it means the webmaster posted the wrong md5sum on the site
