2006-08-12T14:51:00.000Z	Okita		So my kdm won't start automatically anymore-- I just now got an error related to .ICEauthority
2006-08-12T14:51:00.000Z	Okita		Anyone know what the problem could be?
2006-08-12T14:52:00.000Z	Okita		It probably has something to do with my computer turning off unexpectedly?
2006-08-12T14:52:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Okita	eh, I'd say you have bigger problems than .ICEauthority if your pc is turning of on its own.
2006-08-12T14:53:00.000Z	Okita	fyrestrtr	No, I mean, it doesn't boot up into kdm anymore... I can log in at console and do startx
2006-08-12T14:53:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Okita	did you do something like login as root, set the root password, or anything like that.
2006-08-12T14:54:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Okita	the *year* 1903 ?
2006-08-12T14:54:00.000Z	Okita	fyrestrtr	Hmm, no?  This started first when my computer ran out of batteries and turned off
2006-08-12T14:54:00.000Z	Okita	fyrestrtr	Yes
2006-08-12T14:54:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Okita	is it a laptop?
2006-08-12T14:55:00.000Z	Okita	fyrestrtr	I tried ntpdate, and that gets KDE to show the right time, but not the "date" command.  Not sure if that's related to it stalling at a status bar screen when starting KDE
2006-08-12T14:55:00.000Z	Okita	fyrestrtr	Yes
2006-08-12T14:55:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Okita	hrmm this is looking more and more like a hardware issue.
2006-08-12T14:55:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Okita	is it restarting, and then the date resets?
2006-08-12T14:56:00.000Z	Okita	fyrestrtr	Nono, it's not that it turns off, it's just that on startup, it doesn't automatically display a login prompt anymore
2006-08-12T14:56:00.000Z	Okita	fyrestrtr	Yet it works if I do ctrl-alt-f1, and then login
2006-08-12T14:56:00.000Z	fyrestrtr	Okita	hrmm, that could be something as simple as you remove kdm from the startup scripts.
2006-08-12T14:57:00.000Z	Okita	fyrestrtr	Ok, I'm just not sure what went wrong that its behavior changed in the first place
