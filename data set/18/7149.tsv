2010-03-26T22:44:00.000Z	nightsjammies		so can anyone help me?
2010-03-26T22:45:00.000Z	nightsjammies		I'm having trouble getting my boot menu to show up..I replaced ## hiddenmenu with # hiddenmenu and #hiddenmenu, and I still have to hit esc.
2010-03-26T22:46:00.000Z	nightsjammies		I still have to hit esc to get into the boot menu
2010-03-26T22:46:00.000Z	nightsjammies		here's the pastebin: http://pastebin.com/dQsgvcap
2010-03-26T22:47:00.000Z	maginot	nightsjammies	you have to commend hiddenmenu...
2010-03-26T22:48:00.000Z	maginot	nightsjammies	did you read what I told you? Comment hiddenmenu
2010-03-26T22:51:00.000Z	maginot	nightsjammies	again. Did you put a "#" in front of hiddenmenu ?
2010-03-26T22:52:00.000Z	maginot	nightsjammies	^
2010-03-26T22:57:00.000Z	maginot	nightsjammies	if you pastebin your menu.lst I may help you.
2010-03-26T22:58:00.000Z	maginot	nightsjammies	do the follow: cat /boot/grub/menu.lst | grep hiddenmenu
2010-03-26T22:58:00.000Z	maginot	nightsjammies	pastebin the output of the command I gave you.
2010-03-26T22:59:00.000Z	maginot	nightsjammies	again. You have not commented hiddenmenu
2010-03-26T23:00:00.000Z	maginot	nightsjammies	see, you have a second hiddenmenu which isn't commented
2010-03-26T23:03:00.000Z	maginot	nightsjammies	sure.
2010-03-26T23:04:00.000Z	maginot	nightsjammies	its there in the case you need after an update. If the last one is working properly you can remove the other, but that wont remove the kernels from /boot
2010-03-26T23:05:00.000Z	maginot	nightsjammies	yep
2010-03-26T23:06:00.000Z	maginot	nightsjammies	but take care to not make any mistakes. I recommend you to backup menu.lst first.
2010-03-26T23:11:00.000Z	maginot	nightsjammies	looks to be right.
