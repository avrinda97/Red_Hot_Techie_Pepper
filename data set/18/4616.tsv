2010-01-22T23:04:00.000Z	Ziber		A box that I have has 22mb free of physical RAM, but has ~2G of swap. if physical RAM runs out, will I notice?
2010-01-22T23:05:00.000Z	Ziber		noticably slower?
2010-01-22T23:05:00.000Z	Ziber		okay.
2010-01-22T23:06:00.000Z	Ziber		alright...
2010-01-22T23:06:00.000Z	acicula	Ziber	free -m reports the total mem in use and the mem acutally used after subtracting buffered stuff
2010-01-22T23:06:00.000Z	Ziber	acicula	yeah, thats how i saw that is has very little physical ram left.
2010-01-22T23:06:00.000Z	Ziber		*it has
2010-01-22T23:06:00.000Z	Ziber		okay.
2010-01-22T23:07:00.000Z	acicula	Ziber	thats normal, look in the free column ,the 2e value is the real fre memory for applications
2010-01-22T23:07:00.000Z	Ziber		ie, on a VM i'm running, i have 2mb of physical ram (only gave it 128mb), but 2G of swap.
2010-01-22T23:08:00.000Z	Ziber		well, as long as it wont run out of mem and like crash or something, im fine.
2010-01-22T23:09:00.000Z	acicula	Ziber	your actual mem is backed by swap, so its almost always dettrimental to assign very little memory and much hd swap to a vm
2010-01-22T23:10:00.000Z	Ziber	acicula	its a bad idea to give 2G of hd swap and 128mb RAM? why?
2010-01-22T23:10:00.000Z	acicula	Ziber	say you have 4GB of actual mem, and start 10 VMS wit 128MB mem and the rest HD swap
2010-01-22T23:10:00.000Z	acicula	Ziber	it will lead to extensive hd swapping while you still have plenty of mem left
2010-01-22T23:10:00.000Z	acicula		your OS will back real mem with swap when necessary
2010-01-22T23:10:00.000Z	Ziber		well, the physical box only has 256mb of RAM to begin with.
2010-01-22T23:11:00.000Z	acicula	Ziber	ah, then why virtualize on that?
