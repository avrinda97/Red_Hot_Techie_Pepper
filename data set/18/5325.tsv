2010-05-19T21:30:00.000Z	Roasted	_blackwater_	I have a broadcom chip in my laptop. :(
2010-05-19T21:31:00.000Z	Roasted	_blackwater_	We have several networks here. WPA2, WPA, I use WPA at home, and here at the high school (I work in a school district) we use WPA2 Enterprise. Everything works except ht emiddle school's WPA network.
2010-05-19T21:32:00.000Z	Roasted	_blackwater_	yet I know the hardware itself can handle it. We have 100 identical laptops on XP Pro for studentes that work fine. My laptop is identical except on Ubuntu.
2010-05-19T21:32:00.000Z	Roasted	_blackwater_	what do you mean?
2010-05-19T21:34:00.000Z	Roasted	_blackwater_	the AP and password is fine. Im positive of that. Ive even deleted the network from my history and re-connected to it. Or, tried to at least. It just keeps bombing out.
2010-05-19T21:35:00.000Z	Roasted	_blackwater_	what will that prove? Whether or not the PW is fine?
2010-05-19T21:36:00.000Z	Roasted	_blackwater_	so do I just type that command in and THEN try to connect to the wireless?
2010-05-19T21:40:00.000Z	Roasted	_blackwater_	the thing is theres a checkbox to *show password* in plain text. I am absolutely, positively, 100% that the password is completely correct. There's no getting around that. I type it in windows, it works. I type it in ubuntu, it doesn't. Same PW. Same SSID. Same network.
2010-05-25T21:19:00.000Z	Roasted	_blackwater_	broadcom 4322
2010-05-25T21:20:00.000Z	Roasted	_blackwater_	worked fine in 810, 904, 910, but 10.04 presents some issues, not to mention random disconnects even tho Im sitting within a few feet of an access point with perfect signal.
2010-05-25T21:20:00.000Z	Roasted	_blackwater_	been there, done that, already got that software.
2010-05-25T21:21:00.000Z	Roasted	_blackwater_	once installed, was I to do anything with it?
2010-05-25T21:21:00.000Z	Roasted	_blackwater_	i can see the access points fine, it just gives me a headache when trying to connect. I could do all of this PRIOR to even installing that package.
2010-05-25T21:21:00.000Z	Roasted	_blackwater_	already did that too, and even posted it on a bug on launchpad. *sigh*
2010-05-25T21:22:00.000Z	Roasted	_blackwater_	nope, I used wifi radar - I can see all APs are on different channels.
2010-05-25T21:24:00.000Z	Roasted	_blackwater_	Ill just have to put 9.10 back in. it'd be one thing if it were a personal laptop, but its a work laptop. I kinda need... to... work. :(
2010-05-25T21:25:00.000Z	Roasted	_blackwater_	meh. I'd rather just use something stable. After all, I have more issues than just wireless. Fore xample, I closed my laptop lid, opened it back up, and the resolution was out of whack. I'm sorry, but WTF??
