2006-11-26T13:46:00.000Z	Dreamglider		i just installed flash and now when i open a webpage firefox shut's down!

2006-11-26T13:47:00.000Z	Dreamglider	kitche	i dont know, i just installed the flash that firefox poped up
2006-11-26T13:47:00.000Z	kitche	Dreamglider	yeah it;s flash 7 that has a bug in it
2006-11-27T17:50:00.000Z	kitche	Dreamglider	your sound might be used by another program what flash do you have flash7 or flash9 beta?
2006-11-27T17:50:00.000Z	Dreamglider	kitche	flash9
2006-11-27T17:51:00.000Z	kitche	Dreamglider	wonder if esd is interfereing with the sound since I know arts can do that
2006-11-27T17:52:00.000Z	Dreamglider	kitche	 can i do anything about it ?
2006-11-27T17:52:00.000Z	kitche	Dreamglider	I would turn off esd myself but don't know how to do that since I m not a gnome user
2006-11-27T17:54:00.000Z	kitche	Dreamglider	everythign works for me outside the box but then again I don't use soemthing that has a sound server
2006-11-30T08:06:00.000Z	kitche	Dreamglider	probably your sound is being used by another thing for example maybe a sound server
2006-11-30T08:07:00.000Z	Dreamglider	kitche	how can i fix it then ?
2006-11-30T08:08:00.000Z	kitche	Dreamglider	you using gnome correct?
2006-11-30T08:08:00.000Z	Dreamglider	kitche	i just installed it, and yea i think i am!
2006-11-30T08:09:00.000Z	kitche	Dreamglider	open up a console and do killall esd then restart firefox then you should have sound perhaps but that's a start anyways
2006-11-30T08:11:00.000Z	Dreamglider	kitche	No go i dont hear anything
2006-11-30T08:12:00.000Z	Dreamglider	kitche	I Dont hear anything when playing video files in firefox. (youtube, abaum and suchj)
2008-11-02T22:35:00.000Z	kitche	Dreamglider	why install it on a computer hence what a playstation3 is
