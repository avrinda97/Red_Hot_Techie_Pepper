2007-04-25T09:32:00.000Z	rickympl	stefg	thanks, but nothing helped
2007-04-25T09:33:00.000Z	stefg	rickympl	so what doesn't work?
2007-04-25T09:33:00.000Z	rickympl		i cant ping other machines on my lan
2007-04-25T09:33:00.000Z	rickympl	stefg	theredore samba doesnt work neither
2007-04-25T09:34:00.000Z	rickympl	stefg	how can i not ping other machines? they are on and connected to the lan router
2007-04-25T09:34:00.000Z	stefg	rickympl	firewall issue? router-configuration?
2007-04-25T09:35:00.000Z	rickympl	stefg	the router-configuration stayed the same from b4 reinstalling feisty to now, firestarter has ports for samba opened
2007-04-25T09:36:00.000Z	stefg	rickympl	hmmm... avahi and network-manager are new in feisty. maybe it has something to do with it
2007-04-25T09:37:00.000Z	rickympl	stefg	i can ping my router, any server on the net, except for other machine on my lan
2007-04-25T09:37:00.000Z	stefg	rickympl	but you could before?
2007-04-25T09:37:00.000Z	rickympl	stefg	i cant even ping a virtual machine
2007-04-25T09:38:00.000Z	rickympl	stefg	b4 reinstalling i had samba working perfectly
2007-04-25T09:38:00.000Z	stefg		!network
2007-04-25T09:38:00.000Z	stefg		baah
2007-04-25T09:39:00.000Z	stefg	rickympl	so it's not a samba, but a network problem. Did you run a couple of tests with the network diagnosis applet?
2007-04-25T09:40:00.000Z	rickympl	stefg	no i did not
2007-04-25T09:40:00.000Z	rickympl	stefg	how do i do that
2007-04-25T09:41:00.000Z	stefg	rickympl	system-admin-network-diagnosis (or similar, got german gnome here)
