2009-04-16T17:40:00.000Z	Morclye		Is using this command the best way to make Amarok launch instead of Rhythmbox as default player for my media hotkey? "sudo ln -s /usr/bin/amarok /usr/local/bin/rhythmbox"
2009-04-16T17:40:00.000Z	ziroday	Morclye	not really, then you won't be able to open rhythmbox again unless you remove the symlink or put the rhythmbox file somewhere else
2009-04-16T17:42:00.000Z	Morclye	ziroday	Good to know and I'm glad that was not the first thing I tried. Thank you too
2009-04-19T13:40:00.000Z	ziroday	Morclye	that is the ati catalyst driver
2009-04-19T13:40:00.000Z	Morclye	ziroday	Oh, I think I still need to remove it in order to try out the new one, right?
2009-04-19T13:41:00.000Z	ziroday	Morclye	how are you trying out the new one?
2009-04-19T13:41:00.000Z	Morclye	ziroday	Downloading Catalyst 9.4 from ATI driver support page and installing it with the script it comes with
2009-04-19T13:42:00.000Z	ziroday	Morclye	sure, but why?
2009-04-19T13:42:00.000Z	ziroday	Morclye	do the current drivers not work?
2009-04-19T13:43:00.000Z	Morclye	ziroday	No, I've had a lot of problems with these ones, none of 3D programs work correctly and even 2D is miserable. When I drag program windows around they move in steps leaving ghost frames behind dragging path
2009-04-19T13:44:00.000Z	Morclye	ziroday	And all this with desktop effects disabled. I have flickering videos too. Enabling effects makes things even worse and I was hoping new drivers would bring happiness to this
2009-04-19T13:44:00.000Z	ziroday	Morclye	hmm they shouldn't. The package you want to remove is xorg-driver-fglrx
2009-04-19T13:46:00.000Z	Morclye	ziroday	Thank you. Will I have GUI working anymore after removing that package?
2009-04-19T13:46:00.000Z	ziroday	Morclye	yes, until you restart your xserver. So make sure you install the new drivers first
2009-04-19T13:48:00.000Z	Morclye	ziroday	This kind of community support is what keeps me wanting to get used to Ubuntu, thank you again :)
2009-04-19T13:49:00.000Z	ziroday	Morclye	ha, I'm sorry your graphics driver isn't working. What card is it?
2009-04-19T13:49:00.000Z	Morclye	ziroday	ATI Radeon HD3850 made by Sapphire
2009-04-19T13:50:00.000Z	ziroday	Morclye	hmm, that card should work
