2012-10-17T11:02:00.000Z	Casey		Hi there. I'm having issues installing linux mint 13. I realize this forum is for Ubuntu but no one is on the mint forum. If I could pick someone's brain, I would greatly appreciate it.

2012-10-17T11:05:00.000Z	BlueEagle	Casey	I know. It's funny though. :)
2012-10-17T11:08:00.000Z	BlueEagle	Casey	The Ubuntu 12.04 livecd boots just fine here. Which BIOS version do you have?
2012-10-17T11:08:00.000Z	Casey	BlueEagle	I'm not really sure
2012-10-17T11:08:00.000Z	BlueEagle	Casey	And the initrd, which is probably the root cause of your issue is one of the bigger differences between distros.
2012-10-17T11:09:00.000Z	BlueEagle	Casey	You also ofcourse verified the md5 sum and attempted to pass parameters under "Advanced" not to use bootsplash?
2012-10-17T11:10:00.000Z	BlueEagle	Casey	initrd = initial ram disk. It is the what is loaded first when booting.
2012-10-17T11:12:00.000Z	BlueEagle	Casey	That was not all you did. First you downloaded the .iso image, then you got the MD5 sum and an md5sum checker and verified that the downloade wasn't corrupt. Then you burned the image to a dvd and attempted to boot from the dvd. When you tried it you did get the Ubuntu boot menu and pressed start from LiveCD. Then all you were left with was a blinking cursor.
2012-10-17T11:13:00.000Z	BlueEagle	Casey	Just getting the facts on the table. If, at the boot menu you edit the command prompt not to load bootsplash, does that help?
2012-10-17T11:15:00.000Z	BlueEagle	Casey	Then the best advise I can give you is to install from the Ubuntu alternate cd/dvd. That uses a text-based installer.
2012-10-17T11:16:00.000Z	BlueEagle	Casey	Just out of curiousity; If you try the live CD from another distro, like Mint (which is not supported here), is that able to boot to X11?
2012-10-17T11:16:00.000Z	Casey	BlueEagle	hypothetically I have not treid X11. What does that refer too?
2012-10-17T11:17:00.000Z	BlueEagle	Casey	X11 is what the window manager runs on.
2012-10-17T11:17:00.000Z	BlueEagle	Casey	Which is what is not starting.
2012-10-17T11:17:00.000Z	Casey	BlueEagle	sorry to be dense but could you elaborate on what I am supposed to do with that knowledge?
2012-10-17T11:19:00.000Z	BlueEagle	Casey	If you try another livecd from another distro that will rule out an issue with the bootloader, initrd and default x11 settings. Since Ubuntu is not working perhaps a Mint or Zorin or other liveCD may work. It will determine if it is Ubuntu that is at fault or if it is a generic issue with your PC and X11/xorg and so on.
