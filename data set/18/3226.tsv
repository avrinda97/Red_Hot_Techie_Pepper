2010-07-26T04:17:00.000Z	eduardiyo		In first time sorry for my bad english, in the second place I have a problem with my wireless interface "eth3: ERROR while getting interface flags: No such device", I received this message when I was reboot forced, some help?
2010-07-26T04:17:00.000Z	eduardiyo		at ubuntu-es nobody can helps me
2010-07-26T04:19:00.000Z	soreau	eduardiyo	When or where do you get this message?
2010-07-26T04:19:00.000Z	eduardiyo	soreau	when I try to modify /etc/network/interfaces file
2010-07-26T04:20:00.000Z	soreau	eduardiyo	Does ifconfig and iwconfig show your interfaces?
2010-07-26T04:20:00.000Z	eduardiyo	soreau	wait
2010-07-26T04:21:00.000Z	eduardiyo	soreau	wait, I need to post the query to show you
2010-07-26T04:23:00.000Z	eduardiyo	soreau	http://pastebin.com/fUisgNsE but after was be eth3, why now eth1 and how can I resolve the problem please?
2010-07-26T04:24:00.000Z	soreau	eduardiyo	I don't know but you probably need to find whatever file is telling it to look for eth3 and change it to the correct value. Perhaps try 'grep -Rn eth3 /etc'
2010-07-26T04:26:00.000Z	eduardiyo	soreau	I only have the lines modify at interfaces file, how can I do configure it to get wireless on at startup ?
2010-07-26T04:26:00.000Z	soreau	eduardiyo	What do you mean 'get wireless on at startup'? You mean connect to the access point automatically?
2010-07-26T04:26:00.000Z	eduardiyo	soreau	yeah, sorry for my english
2010-07-26T04:28:00.000Z	eduardiyo	soreau	I modify the file as http://pastebin.com/JuPBZeqg do you think that will run?
2010-07-26T04:28:00.000Z	soreau	eduardiyo	No problem but the only way I knwo to get it to connect at boot time is to stop nm-applet and NetworkManager from starting, then write your own script to connect and put it in /etc/rc.local
2010-07-26T04:29:00.000Z	eduardiyo	soreau	and what can I do to make the new interface (older eth3) on?
2010-07-26T04:30:00.000Z	soreau	eduardiyo	I don't know
2010-07-26T04:30:00.000Z	eduardiyo	soreau	well, wish me luck
