2005-09-28T12:01:00.000Z	DaSkreech		How do I purge the apt cache?
2005-09-28T12:02:00.000Z	tritium	DaSkreech	cafuego told you
2005-09-28T12:02:00.000Z	tritium	DaSkreech	in /var/cache/apt/archives?  Yes.
2005-09-28T12:03:00.000Z	DaSkreech	tritium	Thanks
2005-09-28T13:03:00.000Z	tritium	DaSkreech	apt-cache policy is even easier
2005-09-28T13:04:00.000Z	tritium	DaSkreech	what do you mean by "listed"?  On the command line, or in your /etc/apt/sources.list ?
2005-09-28T13:05:00.000Z	DaSkreech	tritium	In the apt sources.list
2005-09-28T13:05:00.000Z	tritium	DaSkreech	no, you need to have it listed
2005-09-28T13:06:00.000Z	DaSkreech	tritium	That's not very helpful then
2005-09-28T13:06:00.000Z	tritium	DaSkreech	why not put all the repos in yours sources.list?
2005-09-28T13:06:00.000Z	DaSkreech	tritium	I could but I'd have to do that every time I have this problem
2005-09-28T13:07:00.000Z	DaSkreech	tritium	This is more a whine about the site than anything else :)
2005-09-28T13:08:00.000Z	tritium	DaSkreech	no you wouldn't.  Leave them there.
2005-09-28T13:08:00.000Z	tritium	DaSkreech	then why not use ubotu's !info <packagename> <release> ?
2005-09-28T13:09:00.000Z	tritium	DaSkreech	which package?
2005-09-28T13:10:00.000Z	tritium	DaSkreech	main, if it does not specify
2006-06-22T15:35:00.000Z	tritium	DaSkreech	no
2006-06-22T15:35:00.000Z	DaSkreech	tritium	Cool thanks
