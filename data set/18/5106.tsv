2009-01-10T08:29:00.000Z	kristian_		is "traceroute" and "tracert" the same thing? they both give the same man page, from "man traceroute" and "man tracert", but they give me completely different results. when i type "traceroute google.com" i get this: http://paste.ubuntu.com/103003/ - while from "sudo tracert google.com" i get this: http://paste.ubuntu.com/103004/ - so there has to be a difference? (strange that i have to run tracert as sudo and not traceroute as sudo!) i ha
2009-01-10T08:30:00.000Z	w3wsrmn	kristian_	check the traceroute man. tracert = traceroute -I (pings)
2009-01-10T08:30:00.000Z	kristian_		192.168.0.1 is my wireless router*
2009-01-10T08:31:00.000Z	w3wsrmn		hehe
2009-01-10T08:32:00.000Z	kristian_	w3wsrmn	: ok thanks. :-) but tracert/traceroute -I still gives a less complete route than tracert in cmd/windows, how can i get the complete route? :-)
2009-01-10T08:34:00.000Z	w3wsrmn	kristian_	oh, sorry, my response wasn't clear. you'll want to use traceroute, not tracert. And don't use the -I switch as most hops won't respond to the pings.
2009-01-10T08:39:00.000Z	kristian_	w3wsrmn	: well, if i use traceroute alone i get this: http://paste.ubuntu.com/103003/ - no results. and i dont think "tracert" = "traceroute -I", because i get much better results from "traceroute -I" than from "tracert". basically "traceroute" = no results, "tracert" = some result, "traceroute -I" = more complete result, but still the result from cmd in windows is more complete, showing more accurate. :-/

2009-01-10T08:43:00.000Z	w3wsrmn	kristian_	the traceroute manpage states tracert = traceroute -I. Anyways, what do you mean by "windows is more complete"? Do certain which respond under windows provide only * under linux?
2009-01-10T08:44:00.000Z	w3wsrmn	kristian_	*Do certain hops, rather
2009-01-10T08:46:00.000Z	kristian_	w3wsrmn	: "Do certain which respond under windows provide only * under linux?" - yes! this is what i was trying to say, sorry about my crap explaining. :-P
2009-01-10T08:48:00.000Z	w3wsrmn	kristian_	ah, okies. Hrm... try increasing the response timeout to 15 or 20 seconds with the -w switch (eg -w 15) with and without -I
2009-01-10T08:57:00.000Z	kristian_	w3wsrmn	: thanks! :-) "traceroute -w 30" still gave only *, but "traceroute -I -w 30" gave no * results. :-) one last question, the "traceroute -I -w 30" gives no *'s, but it only gives 19 routes, while cmd/windows gives 29 routes, how can this be?
2009-01-10T08:59:00.000Z	w3wsrmn	kristian_	the difference in a number of hops could be due to the lovely redundancy of the interwebs. one hope may be sending you down a path which requires communicating with more switches/routers, hence the additional hops.
2009-01-10T09:00:00.000Z	w3wsrmn	kristian_	another thing, by default traceroute used UDP (-U), which gave you only *. It's possible your firewall (on linux, since windows was fine) is blocking the UDP packets.
2009-01-10T09:04:00.000Z	kristian_	w3wsrmn	: ok, i understand that the number of switches/routers will increase the number of hops, but ever time i traceroute with ubuntu the hops is 10 less then when i traceroute with windows. i've tried several times now, and i cant see how this can just be a coincident, it has to have something to do with the os. any thoughts? - got no firewall on ubuntu so it should be fine. i am not sure how the wireless router or my modem/router is co
2009-01-10T09:06:00.000Z	kristian_	w3wsrmn	: ubuntu/win machine - wireless router - modem/with firewall config - internet
2009-01-10T09:08:00.000Z	w3wsrmn	kristian_	hrm. as for the additional hops, i'm at a loss. the only difference i'm aware of between linux/win traceroutes are linux by default = udp (-U) and windows by default ICMP (-I), hence the differences you saw after adding -I and upping -w.
