2009-05-03T11:55:00.000Z	gleg		Hey guys, I'm running Gutsy, I don't wish to upgrade, all I want is to download some applications from the Ubuntu repositories.  Is there some way to allow my computer to download third party software without upgrading? It seems simple enough.
2009-05-03T11:55:00.000Z	Madpilot	gleg	applications have depencies which change - it can be hard to upgrade 'just one package'...
2009-05-03T11:56:00.000Z	gleg	Madpilot	Thanks, thats what I have been attempting.  Should I just delete all my gutsy sources from Ubuntu, since they are all now completely unsupported?
2009-05-03T11:57:00.000Z	Madpilot	gleg	you really should upgrade. There are no more security releases for Gutsy
2009-05-03T11:58:00.000Z	gleg	Madpilot	I know, I'm just so fearful.  It was hard enough getting everything working now.  It's only been about 4 months since my last huge problem.
2009-05-03T11:59:00.000Z	Madpilot	gleg	later versions are a lot slicker than gutsy, trust me.
2009-05-03T12:01:00.000Z	Madpilot	gleg	8.04 LTS has 18 months or more to run - LTS = Long Term Support
2009-05-03T12:02:00.000Z	Madpilot	gleg	LTS releases get 3 years of security updates for the desktop version - so until April 2011
2009-05-03T12:04:00.000Z	Madpilot	gleg	do you have /home on a seperate partition?
2009-05-03T12:05:00.000Z	gleg	Madpilot	No, my entire filesystem is on the same partition.
2009-05-03T12:06:00.000Z	Madpilot	gleg	hmm. /home on a seperate partition makes upgrades much less nervewracking. even if the upgrade goes screwy, your own data & settings are safe
2009-05-03T12:07:00.000Z	gleg	Madpilot	Is it even more than that... can you still boot into your old /home drive and use your computer, granted on the old release?
2009-05-03T12:08:00.000Z	Madpilot	gleg	no, when you have /home on a seperate partition from / (the system) the old release will get overwritten by the new one
2009-05-03T12:10:00.000Z	gleg	Madpilot	Is there a way to do what I was talking about?  A way to have more than one release running at one time, to later merge at a more convieniet time?
2009-05-03T12:10:00.000Z	Madpilot	gleg	you could, but it would be a lot of work
2009-05-03T12:12:00.000Z	gleg	Madpilot	Shucks, I'm nearing finals as a senior in college, and this is my only computer.  I would rather not have it be "mess with the operating system time", and possibly ruining everything.
2009-05-03T12:12:00.000Z	Madpilot	gleg	then leave it as is for a while - an unsupported Linux install is still pretty safe. Play with it over summer break.
2009-05-03T12:13:00.000Z	gleg	Madpilot	Yes, it will have to wait.  All: Thanks for the help, you guys are the true heros of Ubunut, Linux, and the world.
