2008-03-19T12:55:00.000Z	SidStudios		Did it work?
2008-03-19T12:55:00.000Z	SidStudios		What?
2008-03-19T12:55:00.000Z	riskbreaker_	SidStudios	step 2b did not
2008-03-19T12:55:00.000Z	SidStudios		What makes you think you're not running AMD64?
2008-03-19T12:55:00.000Z	riskbreaker_		"generic"
2008-03-19T12:55:00.000Z	riskbreaker_		shouldn't it say amd64?
2008-03-19T12:55:00.000Z	SidStudios		Try using uname -n
2008-03-19T12:55:00.000Z	SidStudios		I don't think so
2008-03-19T12:56:00.000Z	SidStudios		I had generic too
2008-03-19T12:56:00.000Z	SidStudios		Or uname -l
2008-03-19T12:56:00.000Z	SidStudios		One of them tells you if you run 64
2008-03-19T12:57:00.000Z	SidStudios	jescis	Ah, thanks :)
2008-03-19T12:57:00.000Z	SidStudios	jescis	I actually wouldn't know since I use vista now..
2008-03-19T12:57:00.000Z	riskbreaker_		uname -a returns the following: Linux mbrainprime 2.6.24-12-generic #1 SMP Wed Mar 12 22:31:43 UTC 2008 x86_64 GNU/Linux
2008-03-19T12:58:00.000Z	riskbreaker_		okay
2008-03-19T12:58:00.000Z	SidStudios	jescis	I didn't know poor people could afford vista ;)
2008-03-19T12:58:00.000Z	riskbreaker_		i was just worried because it said generic... and i thought that was where the platform name went
2008-03-19T12:58:00.000Z	riskbreaker_	SidStudios	- i'ma try 2a
