2010-11-13T06:16:00.000Z	dwdking	boxbeatsy	file1 >> file2
2010-11-13T06:16:00.000Z	boxbeatsy	dwdking	sweet thank you!

2010-11-13T06:18:00.000Z	boxbeatsy	dwdking	hmm, when i do test1.txt >> test2.txst i get test1.txt: command not found.  any ideas?
2010-11-13T06:18:00.000Z	dwdking	boxbeatsy	Does test1.txt exist?
2010-11-13T06:18:00.000Z	boxbeatsy	dwdking	ya
2010-11-13T06:19:00.000Z	dwdking	boxbeatsy	where does it exist?
2010-11-13T06:19:00.000Z	boxbeatsy		in the folder i'm running the command in
2010-11-13T06:20:00.000Z	dwdking	boxbeatsy	hmmm I am not too sure why it isn't working
2010-11-13T06:20:00.000Z	dwdking	boxbeatsy	oh sorry, do "cat test1.txt >> test2.txt"
2010-11-13T06:21:00.000Z	boxbeatsy	dwdking	aaah perfect! thanks :D
2010-11-13T06:21:00.000Z	dwdking	boxbeatsy	cat will print to the terminal what is in the file test1.txt and the >> pipes it into the other file specifified
2010-11-13T06:21:00.000Z	dwdking	boxbeatsy	sorry forgot the cat
2010-11-13T06:21:00.000Z	boxbeatsy	dwdking	gotcha. thanks!
2010-11-13T06:22:00.000Z	dwdking	boxbeatsy	becareful because using a single > will overwrite the second file, I would recommend always backing up the second file before using it
2010-11-13T06:22:00.000Z	boxbeatsy	dwdking	mmk, i'm writing a shell script, so it should be fine, right?
2010-11-13T06:24:00.000Z	dwdking	boxbeatsy	ya you should be okay, less change of accidentally only putting one > in but it always is a good idea to backup if your concerned about losing a system file or any work
