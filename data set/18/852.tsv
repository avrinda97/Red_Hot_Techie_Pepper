2011-11-28T00:21:00.000Z	devslash		I'm installing ubuntu in virtual box and I assigned the VM 2GB of ram. how much swap space do i really need ?
2011-11-28T00:21:00.000Z	devslash		do i need more than 1 GB of swap
2011-11-28T00:21:00.000Z	Gentoo64	devslash	you prob wont even _need_ swap, but use whatever
2011-11-28T00:24:00.000Z	Gentoo64	devslash	for general use ubuntu should use anywhere near the full 2gb, but swap wont hurt, give it 512mb or whatever space you can afford
2011-11-28T00:24:00.000Z	devslash	Gentoo64	the VM has a total of 12GB
2011-11-28T00:25:00.000Z	Gentoo64	devslash	well give it 2gb  just for the sake of it
2011-11-28T00:25:00.000Z	Gentoo64	devslash	yeah
2011-11-28T00:26:00.000Z	devslash	Gentoo64	i don't want to worry about running out of space later on ..
2011-11-28T00:26:00.000Z	Gentoo64	devslash	10gb youll be able to install quite a lot on
2011-11-28T00:26:00.000Z	Gentoo64	devslash	youll probably get used to it and end up install it proper anyway :)
2011-11-28T00:29:00.000Z	devslash	Gentoo64	i know it doesn't matter but as a general practice, is it a good idea to have root as hda1 and swap hda2 or vice versa
2011-11-28T00:29:00.000Z	Gentoo64	devslash	put root on 1 just to be neat lol
2011-11-28T00:31:00.000Z	Gentoo64	devslash	if it were me, id just give ubuntu 1 big / partition and sue that
2011-11-28T00:31:00.000Z	devslash	Gentoo64	you mean without any swap ?
2011-11-28T00:31:00.000Z	Gentoo64	devslash	i wouldnt bother with swap. i run every one of my vms with 2gb ram no swap
2011-11-28T00:33:00.000Z	devslash	Gentoo64	ok but if shit gets wonky I'm gonna come back and give you crap about it
2011-11-28T00:35:00.000Z	devslash	Gentoo64	the installer for ubuntu so so much nicer in ubuntu 11. it lets you set time, username/password while the files are being copied. thats smart
2011-11-28T01:07:00.000Z	devslash	Gentoo64	wow the unity interface is nice...
