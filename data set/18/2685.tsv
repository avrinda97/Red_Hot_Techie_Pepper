2010-03-27T08:29:00.000Z	airtonix	[Screamo]	whats your real question. (there are lots of wireless chipsets, and various types of ubuntu)
2010-03-27T08:31:00.000Z	airtonix	[Screamo]	1) try keep it on one line here. (enter key is not the new spacebar) 2) investigate the use of ndiswrapper.

2010-05-22T15:11:00.000Z	airtonix	[Screamo]	hardly.
2010-05-22T15:13:00.000Z	airtonix	[Screamo]	laugh all you want, but last time i tried to use rainmeter to do what conky can it failed miserably.
2010-05-22T15:16:00.000Z	airtonix	[Screamo]	last time i checked you couldnt programme your own plugins to rainmeter with lua that used the cairo lib.
2010-05-22T15:16:00.000Z	[Screamo]	airtonix	when was the last time you checked?
2010-05-22T15:16:00.000Z	airtonix	[Screamo]	if you wanted a plugin that did anything useful you needed to programme it in c and then compile it.
2010-05-22T15:16:00.000Z	airtonix	[Screamo]	not long ago. i doubt its changed.
2010-05-22T15:18:00.000Z	airtonix	[Screamo]	i know exactly what rainmeter is
2010-05-22T15:18:00.000Z	airtonix	[Screamo]	http://milax.org/img/conky172.png << those rings in bottom right corner are not images.
2010-05-22T15:20:00.000Z	airtonix	[Screamo]	rainmeter just doesnt have the scripting power that conky has available to it by virtue of being a linux app
2010-05-22T15:21:00.000Z	airtonix	[Screamo]	if i wanted something like that screenshot i wouldnt use rainmeter... you'd be better off using litestep.
2010-07-02T04:47:00.000Z	airtonix	[Screamo]	easiest solution is to stop buying apple products
2010-07-02T04:47:00.000Z	[Screamo]	airtonix	heh, cant
2010-07-02T04:47:00.000Z	airtonix	[Screamo]	LG and samsung make awesome mp4 players
2010-07-02T04:48:00.000Z	airtonix	[Screamo]	until you're next wise purchase, i'd check out handbrake, and the other fourteen hundred transcoders in the repo
