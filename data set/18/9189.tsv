2007-06-23T06:55:00.000Z	spo0nman2		disk is cheap.
2007-06-23T06:55:00.000Z	Gnea	spo0nman2	but bandwidth isn't always
2007-06-23T06:55:00.000Z	spo0nman2	Gnea	you're basically annoying your own early adapters.
2007-06-23T06:56:00.000Z	Gnea	spo0nman2	get with the program, change is constant, didn't they tell you that?
2007-06-23T06:56:00.000Z	Gnea	spo0nman2	what hardware, exactly?
2007-06-23T06:56:00.000Z	spo0nman2	Gnea	yeah! but removing content isn't exactly is helping anyone.
2007-06-23T06:58:00.000Z	Gnea	spo0nman2	you still haven't answered the question.
2007-06-23T06:59:00.000Z	Gnea	spo0nman2	this is a laptop? what make/model is the laptop? might be able to fix it...
2007-06-23T07:00:00.000Z	spo0nman2	Gnea	I've been running debian since 1998. I guess I know what change means. It never meant this. I revisit a box after a year and it's unusable.
2007-06-23T07:00:00.000Z	Gnea	spo0nman2	you're right, there isn't anything to defend, so there's no use.
2007-06-23T07:00:00.000Z	Gnea	spo0nman2	i've been running debian since '97, they're 2 entirely different projects.
2007-06-23T07:01:00.000Z	Gnea	spo0nman2	the bottom line is that we can still TRY to help you out, but instead of trying, you're delving into all of this negativity. get over it and help us help you move on.
