2008-05-03T05:25:00.000Z	jepes		how reliable is md5 sum?
2008-05-03T05:27:00.000Z	jepes		SRr:  i verified my iso, it did okay, but it fails during install...
2008-05-03T05:28:00.000Z	Shadow420	jepes	you could have a bad burn
2008-05-03T05:29:00.000Z	jepes	Shadow420	im installing it to a virtual machine using the iso directly from my HD, image is okay (md5) but it still fails.
2008-05-03T05:29:00.000Z	Shadow420	jepes	try to reburn the image at a slower rate
2008-05-03T05:30:00.000Z	Shadow420	jepes	then redownload the iso possible the iso got corrupted
2008-05-03T05:31:00.000Z	jepes	Shadow420	downloading now, ..thanks anyways...
2008-05-03T05:34:00.000Z	jepes	Shadow420	i still plan on installing to HD after trying it out on VM, i dont want to wipe my current installed buntu (yet).
2008-05-03T05:35:00.000Z	Shadow420	jepes	you could partiton your ubuntu disk in half to have room for hardy
2008-05-03T05:38:00.000Z	jepes	Shadow420	i could, but i still will need to wipe my buntu partition to do so, its on a seperate 6 Gig disk, i dont want to repart my 80G and 40 G drives...
2008-05-03T05:39:00.000Z	jepes	Shadow420	anyways... im trying to download it again from scratch to check.
2008-05-03T05:40:00.000Z	Shadow420	jepes	how many OS's do you have?
2008-05-03T05:41:00.000Z	jepes	Shadow420	only 2 (xp and buntu), i used to have vista but i deleted it after it bloated to 20G just from updated...
2008-05-03T05:42:00.000Z	Shadow420	jepes	ok then you should give xp the 80GB and part the 40GB into 2 20GB partitions
2008-05-03T05:44:00.000Z	jepes	Shadow420	even so, i would still need a good iso image...
2008-05-03T05:45:00.000Z	Shadow420	jepes	true
2008-05-03T05:46:00.000Z	jepes	Shadow420	:-D, its back to VM again,.,..,
2008-05-03T05:57:00.000Z	Shadow420	jepes	so is it working now?
