2012-01-18T03:48:00.000Z	ZooMonkey		hihi!!!! I am setting up a POS for a company, and using Lucid as my main install, however, the software needed wants certain packages from Maverick. I found how to add the Maverick repo manually, but, how does one manually "choose" or "pull" / update a certain package from Out Of the Maverick repo? Like, is there a way to specify the repo, and pack name all in one command?
2012-01-18T03:48:00.000Z	iceroot	ZooMonkey	dont!!! put the mav repo in 10.04
2012-01-18T03:49:00.000Z	iceroot	ZooMonkey	if you use the mav-repo use pinning but that method is not supported here
2012-01-18T03:50:00.000Z	ZooMonkey	iceroot	I'll take a good look into that! Sounds like just what I'm looking for, thx. :)
2012-01-18T03:51:00.000Z	iceroot	ZooMonkey	if possible use backports intead of the mav-repo with pinning
2012-01-18T03:51:00.000Z	iceroot	ZooMonkey	the second method will normally break your system some day
2012-01-18T03:53:00.000Z	ZooMonkey	iceroot	The packages that are "newer" that I need from 10.10 include libwxgtk , libssl, and others. I know it's not good at all.
2012-01-18T03:53:00.000Z	ZooMonkey	iceroot	the hillarious part is, if their installer had been made right *in the first place* this wouldnt be happening. They should have compiled on a 10.04 box.
2012-01-18T03:54:00.000Z	iceroot	ZooMonkey	also please remeber 10.10 will hit EOL on 04.2012 so your packages from that repo dont get sec updates
2012-01-18T03:54:00.000Z	ZooMonkey	iceroot	Yeah I know it's a pisser. That's why I wanted to get it working on 10.04 for LongTermService !!!! But does "Pinning" void that anyway?
2012-01-18T03:55:00.000Z	iceroot	ZooMonkey	not directly
2012-01-18T03:55:00.000Z	iceroot	ZooMonkey	pinning is just a "stopper"
2012-01-18T03:55:00.000Z	iceroot	ZooMonkey	but all packages you install from 10.10 are not supported for long time
2012-01-18T03:56:00.000Z	iceroot	ZooMonkey	and libssl is an important package which needs sec-updates
2012-01-18T03:56:00.000Z	ZooMonkey	iceroot	A very strong point indeed. I should not be sacrificing libssl support for some doo doo heads that don't know how to compile.
2012-01-18T03:56:00.000Z	iceroot	ZooMonkey	:)
2012-01-18T04:01:00.000Z	ZooMonkey	iceroot	Thanks for the help. I'm not sure what we will do. What a rock and a hard place! Maybe we will get a refund if it takes it.
2012-01-18T04:01:00.000Z	iceroot	ZooMonkey	you are welcome
