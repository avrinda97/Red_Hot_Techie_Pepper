2008-10-09T01:29:00.000Z	BlueEagle	bingungbangett	lsusb
2008-10-09T01:29:00.000Z	BlueEagle	bingungbangett	that would be: lsusb
2008-10-09T01:29:00.000Z	BlueEagle	bingungbangett	You might need to have root privileges.
2008-10-09T01:31:00.000Z	BlueEagle	bingungbangett	Those are all the devices connected to your usb ports. Most likely one of them identify your webcam
2008-10-09T01:32:00.000Z	BlueEagle	bingungbangett	And from that we can determine which driver you need.
2008-10-09T01:36:00.000Z	BlueEagle	bingungbangett	Which other usb device have you got attatched along with your webcam?
2008-10-09T01:37:00.000Z	BlueEagle	bingungbangett	Well, could you try detatching your webcam and do lsusb again?
2008-10-09T01:37:00.000Z	BlueEagle	bingungbangett	or is this a buldt-in kind of cam?
2008-10-09T01:38:00.000Z	BlueEagle	bingungbangett	Ahh.. buildt in. Which make and model notebook do you have then?
2008-10-09T01:42:00.000Z	BlueEagle	bingungbangett	try installing luvcview
2008-10-09T01:44:00.000Z	BlueEagle	bingungbangett	sudo apt-get install luvcview
2008-10-09T18:18:00.000Z	BlueEagle	bingungbangett	Does it list your cam in a list of options or atually show cam captures?
2008-10-09T18:19:00.000Z	BlueEagle	bingungbangett	Then the other applications are probably not using the right device.
2008-10-09T18:22:00.000Z	BlueEagle	bingungbangett	The cam diver works or you wouldn't have seen yourself in ekiga. However the other appications you try to use may look for your cam in the wrong place. Now most cam applications has got an option for which device to use. You probably want something like /dev/video0 or somesuch. Also make sure that you're a member of the video group.
2008-10-09T18:26:00.000Z	bingungbangett	BlueEagle	: oh ic ... it's glad to know that my cam is ok, and i finally found the drivers after 2 days searching, when i click "start webcam" in gyachi, the error message stated "an error occured at 'ioctl VIDIOCSPICT'. Could not set camera properties" any idea please ?
2008-10-09T18:27:00.000Z	BlueEagle	bingungbangett	I am sorry, but I've never used gyachi. HAve you attempted to look at the website for any bugs related to this?
2008-10-09T18:29:00.000Z	bingungbangett	BlueEagle	: it's ok, been googling and can't find any bugs, maybe i should remove gyachi and reinstall, thx for your help though, nice to know my cam is ok now hahah
