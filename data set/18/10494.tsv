2006-11-25T12:34:00.000Z	morten_		is the narnia movie any close to as good as the old miniseries from the 80s?
2006-11-25T12:34:00.000Z	morten_		serios question
2006-11-25T12:34:00.000Z	morten_		help me out here, nerds!
2006-11-25T12:35:00.000Z	morten_		maybe i should give it a go. i've heard the miniseries is kinda looked down on since it was low budget, but i've seen that every easter since i can remember, so the new movie will have to work hard at it
2006-11-25T12:35:00.000Z	morten_		i'll give it a go
2006-11-25T12:36:00.000Z	morten_		makes me feel like a little kid again
2006-11-25T12:37:00.000Z	morten_		install nvidia-kernel-common first
2006-11-25T12:37:00.000Z	morten_		or force the install
2006-11-25T12:37:00.000Z	tengo	morten_	i cant access the internet, and its not on the cd
2006-11-25T12:38:00.000Z	morten_	tengo	it probably has multiple layers of dependencies, which causes that
2006-11-25T12:38:00.000Z	morten_	tengo	i guess you're fucked, then
2006-11-25T12:38:00.000Z	tengo	morten_	thanks
