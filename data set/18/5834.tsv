2008-08-15T18:03:00.000Z	blackbinary		I've got an Asus M2N32-Deluxe motherboard, it has built in wireless & wired connections. How can i completely disable the wireless (it seems to be giving me errors)
2008-08-15T18:04:00.000Z	simplexio	blackbinary	gives errors or causes actaul problems?, and bios is good plave to start if you intend totally disable something
2008-08-15T18:05:00.000Z	blackbinary	simplexio	kevin_123, i have been getting crashes and freezes, and the only errors ive gotten before hand relate to my wireless, os i want to disable it completely. might try the bios, but I have no idea where to find it
2008-08-15T18:06:00.000Z	simplexio	blackbinary	throw dmesg into pastebin and i check it after i get back to X
2008-08-15T18:08:00.000Z	simplexio	blackbinary	and one option is also type rmmod "yourwirelessdriver"
2008-08-15T18:08:00.000Z	simplexio	blackbinary	that unloads it
2008-08-15T18:08:00.000Z	simplexio	blackbinary	or remove its driver from /lib/modules/2.6.zzz/........ or blacklist it
2008-08-15T18:09:00.000Z	blackbinary	simplexio	yea i was thinking that but i dont know the driver :/
2008-08-15T18:10:00.000Z	blackbinary	simplexio	yep damn small linux :)

2008-08-15T18:12:00.000Z	blackbinary	simplexio	do you expect an out put from that?
2008-08-15T18:13:00.000Z	simplexio	blackbinary	maybe.. if you get lucky your wireless driver has wire in its name
