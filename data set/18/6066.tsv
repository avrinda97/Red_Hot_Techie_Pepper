2008-07-16T11:37:00.000Z	KDB9000		does anyone know how to see if a button will been sent though acpi? I know there is a way, can't remember how though.

2008-07-16T11:39:00.000Z	KDB9000	xocite	thx
2008-07-16T11:40:00.000Z	KDB9000	xocite	is there more to it? I am not getting anything.
2008-07-16T11:41:00.000Z	xocite	KDB9000	after reading the manpage, you probably determined that you need to start the acpi daemon (acpid)
2008-07-16T11:43:00.000Z	KDB9000	xocite	acpid is running. checked using ps - A | grep acpi
2008-07-16T11:45:00.000Z	xocite	KDB9000	then the button is not being sent through acpi, try using "xev" and checking the output
2008-07-16T11:47:00.000Z	KDB9000	xocite	checked xev and got nothing.
2008-07-16T11:47:00.000Z	KDB9000	xocite	i know xev is working because i can pick up some of the other buttons
2008-07-16T11:51:00.000Z	KDB9000	xocite	in case you are wondering, or might have the answer, i am trying to get the button output form my DV5000 laptop. it has the quickplay buttons and i want to set them so they open music and DVD software, but i need the key code from them
2008-07-16T11:51:00.000Z	xocite	KDB9000	what type of computer/laptop do you have?
2008-07-16T11:51:00.000Z	xocite	KDB9000	ah, I should scrolled up
2008-07-16T11:52:00.000Z	KDB9000	xocite	it is ok, i sent it not too long ago.

2008-07-16T11:57:00.000Z	KDB9000	xocite	Patrick is partly right, yes the dvd button is used to boot the system into an embed windows to play DVD's, but that is when the system is off. when it is on it would start the windows only quick play software. since i can't install quick play on linux, it should still be possible to use the buttons to run linux based systems
2008-07-16T11:59:00.000Z	KDB9000	xocite	Ahadiel has mentioned that is DV6000 laptop (next model up) works fine with all the buttons and I have found key codes for the 6000 to set the DVD button.
2008-07-16T11:59:00.000Z	xocite	KDB9000	let me know if it works
2008-07-16T12:00:00.000Z	KDB9000	xocite	so far i have nothing. was hoping someone in here with a dv5000 might have the answer
