2011-03-07T15:42:00.000Z	trick	jenia	it works fine for me, now tell me how to get it workign in ubuntu pls
2011-03-07T15:44:00.000Z	jenia	trick	can't, never tried to run it in linux, I just installed minitube, xVideoServiceThief and Miro in it.
2011-03-07T15:45:00.000Z	jenia	trick	I could only suggest VirtualBox with some windows installed, if it doesn't work in Wine.
2011-03-07T15:45:00.000Z	trick	jenia	so you figured how to watch stream veoh movies in linux? can you tell me how?
2011-03-07T15:47:00.000Z	trick	jenia	so you figured how to watch stream veoh movies in linux? can you tell me how?
2011-03-07T15:51:00.000Z	jenia	trick	not really, except for the hard way for now, I just browse with proxy (squid) and monitor connections with squidview, and, when I see some big video file starts loading, I copy the url and use it in wget to download it.
2011-03-07T15:52:00.000Z	trick	jenia	ok, can u pls get nme the movie 'kiki's delivery service' and 'howl's moving castle' using that method and send to me? thanks
2011-03-07T15:54:00.000Z	jenia	trick	I don't really have time for it now, just install squid and squidview and do it yourself or install veoh in VirtualBox or Wine.
2011-03-07T15:54:00.000Z	trick	jenia	i only have 1 gig ram, can i install virtual box with that?
2011-03-07T15:55:00.000Z	trick	jenia	im on a netbook
2011-03-07T15:56:00.000Z	jenia	trick	WinXP can work with 128Mb (mimimum), although, I got it to work even with 64Mb of ram. Yes, Gig is enough.
2011-03-07T16:00:00.000Z	trick	jenia	im trying to start virtual box but it's asking for windowsxp cdrom, what do i do
2011-03-07T16:01:00.000Z	jenia	trick	VirtualBox is a Program emulating a real computer, You have to insert some Windows CD/DVD to install it inside of it. Windows will think that it's running on a real computer.
2011-03-07T16:01:00.000Z	trick	jenia	can i just get a windows xp iso or something from the internet?
2011-03-07T16:02:00.000Z	jenia	trick	I cannot advise you this, since it's a piracy, but you can use any win xp cd or iso
2011-03-07T16:05:00.000Z	jenia	trick	did you try to run it with wine?
