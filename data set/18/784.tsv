2011-09-11T04:37:00.000Z	zykotick9	ixxu	what do you mean "n-o-t is always closed on the next restart"?  When you right click in nautilus you don't see "open in terminal"?
2011-09-11T04:39:00.000Z	ixxu	zykotick9	i did never see this... i missed that function i tried with suse before ubuntu
2011-09-11T04:40:00.000Z	ixxu	zykotick9	after installing the nautilius-open-terminal the terminal was in included in the "explorer" upper half was terminal, lower half was file explorer
2011-09-11T04:40:00.000Z	zykotick9	ixxu	did you install the nautilus-open-terminal?
2011-09-11T04:40:00.000Z	ixxu	zykotick9	yes
2011-09-11T04:41:00.000Z	zykotick9	ixxu	sorry, i've never seen nautilus-open-terminal as embedded, it's always opened a new terminal window for me?
2011-09-11T04:41:00.000Z	ixxu	zykotick9	i'll reinstall and take a screenshot
2011-09-11T04:43:00.000Z	ixxu	zykotick9	now it's working fine... lol... thanks anyway
2011-09-11T04:43:00.000Z	zykotick9	ixxu	glad it's working.
2011-09-11T04:44:00.000Z	zykotick9	ixxu	i don't ever remember seeing it embedded, perhaps it wasn't n-o-t but something else that did that?
2011-09-11T04:44:00.000Z	ixxu	zykotick9	i restarted nautilus now it's embedded again
2011-09-11T04:45:00.000Z	ixxu	zykotick9	not something that i installed
2011-09-11T04:45:00.000Z	zykotick9	ixxu	i've used n-o-t for years and never seen that behaviour?  strange, well glad it's working for ya.
2011-09-11T04:46:00.000Z	ixxu	zykotick9	http://i52.tinypic.com/4hy3o2.jpg that's how it looks until next restart
2011-09-11T04:47:00.000Z	zykotick9	ixxu	that's kinda neat, never seen that before.
2011-09-11T04:48:00.000Z	ixxu	zykotick9	yeah dunno would be ok for me as long it's running stable ^^
2011-09-11T04:48:00.000Z	zykotick9	ixxu	i don't think that stable has anything do to with Ubuntu ;)
2011-09-11T04:51:00.000Z	ixxu	zykotick9	better said constant :p
