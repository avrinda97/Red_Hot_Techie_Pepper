2006-08-27T06:40:00.000Z	eyequeue	UKMatt	man tar
2006-09-01T05:34:00.000Z	eyequeue	UKMatt	try to follow the example of the other lines, but "man sources.list" explains details/format
2006-09-01T05:36:00.000Z	eyequeue	UKMatt	no "main" or anything after that"
2006-09-01T05:36:00.000Z	eyequeue	UKMatt	it wants a repo after "dapper"
2006-09-01T05:36:00.000Z	UKMatt	eyequeue	i have no idea what to add after
2006-09-01T05:37:00.000Z	eyequeue	UKMatt	browse the url with firefos or something, to determine the structure they used on that archive, and compare it to an ubuntu archive
2006-09-01T05:38:00.000Z	UKMatt	eyequeue	thats way beyond me
2006-09-01T05:38:00.000Z	eyequeue	UKMatt	um, you can't type a url into firefox?
2006-09-01T05:38:00.000Z	UKMatt	eyequeue	yeah but i really don't even know how a repo works, so couldnt compare it
