2012-09-27T10:11:00.000Z	cfhowlett	crackerjackz	desktop managers are different.  ubuntu is ubuntu.
2012-09-27T10:11:00.000Z	crackerjackz	cfhowlett	i see, so the only difference is the D.E?
2012-09-27T10:11:00.000Z	cfhowlett	crackerjackz	some of the default packages are different as well.
2012-09-27T10:12:00.000Z	cfhowlett	crackerjackz	as somsip correctly stated, lubuntu, like xubuntu, is a "lightweight" distro requiring fewer system resources.  Perfect for older and lower spec machines.
2012-09-27T10:13:00.000Z	crackerjackz	cfhowlett	somsip wilee-nilee  i only have one cd though - i wanna make sure what ever i use works with this ati radeon x850 graphics card
2012-09-27T10:13:00.000Z	cfhowlett	crackerjackz	so boot the live cd and test it.
2012-09-27T10:14:00.000Z	crackerjackz	cfhowlett	no i mean.. i only have 1 blank cd - i wanna make sure the distro i pick is compatible with my hardware
2012-09-27T10:14:00.000Z	cfhowlett	crackerjackz	 ever consider the usb boot option?
2012-09-27T10:16:00.000Z	cfhowlett	crackerjackz	yep.  you can install lubuntu and then install XFCE (or vice versa) and select the alternate desktop environment at login
