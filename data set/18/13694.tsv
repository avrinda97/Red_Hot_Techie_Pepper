2005-10-22T07:55:00.000Z	Sybil		I have a question about Unbuntu live cd...
2005-10-22T07:55:00.000Z	Sybil		I have tried it on pent4 and pent2 with no problems
2005-10-22T07:55:00.000Z	Sybil		but when I try it on pent3 I dont seem to be having access to keyboard nor mouse
2005-10-22T07:56:00.000Z	sn9	Sybil	probably not just because it's a PIII
2005-10-22T07:58:00.000Z	sn9	Sybil	it could be bios. is it a laptop?
2005-10-22T08:01:00.000Z	sn9	Sybil	ps/2 kbd/mouse?
2005-10-22T08:02:00.000Z	sn9	Sybil	usb then?
2005-10-22T08:03:00.000Z	sn9	Sybil	i thought you said the ps/2 mouse port was broken
2005-10-22T08:04:00.000Z	sn9	Sybil	you mean serial?
2005-10-22T08:05:00.000Z	sn9	Sybil	you want to configure a serial mouse?
2005-10-22T08:07:00.000Z	sn9	Sybil	a serial mouse is only automatically detected on computers that don't even have a ps/2 connector
2005-10-22T08:09:00.000Z	sn9	Sybil	there is a way to configure a serial mouse in your case, but i haven't done it myself
2005-10-22T08:10:00.000Z	sn9	Sybil	you can try reconfiguring X to use the serial port, but no guarantees
2005-10-22T08:12:00.000Z	sn9	Sybil	oh. i don't know whether it can be done with the live version
2005-10-22T08:13:00.000Z	sn9	Sybil	but if you install, you can make it work
2005-10-22T08:14:00.000Z	sn9	Sybil	yes, or netinstall
2005-10-22T08:34:00.000Z	sn9	Sybil	on intel? yes
2005-10-22T11:45:00.000Z	sn9	Sybil	yw
