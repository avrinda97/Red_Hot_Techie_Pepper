2006-04-26T05:04:00.000Z	Ademan		for some reason it takes my internet forever to conenct to a server, but then after that navigation is almost instant... this is with ubuntu... someone mentioned it was probably dns problems... but how do i find out what dns server i want?
2006-04-26T05:05:00.000Z	Ademan		because it SEEMS like i need it...
2006-04-26T05:05:00.000Z	Ademan		dsl
2006-04-26T05:05:00.000Z	Ademan		my resolv.conf has nameserver pointing to my router
2006-04-26T05:06:00.000Z	nickrud	Ademan	so does mine, but my dsl modem/router has dns server ...
2006-05-20T11:42:00.000Z	nickrud	Ademan	you can see (what can be seen) in /var/log/dmesg & /var/log/systlog
2006-05-20T11:43:00.000Z	nickrud	Ademan	er, /var/log/syslog
2006-05-20T11:59:00.000Z	nickrud	Ademan	that is not good, /var/log/syslog is the catchal for system messages. Mine has never been empty, I can't imagine why yours is
2006-06-12T06:50:00.000Z	nickrud	Ademan	composting by def requires a not default X server
2006-06-12T06:51:00.000Z	Ademan	nickrud	well how bout this then
2006-06-12T06:52:00.000Z	nickrud	Ademan	xgl is so broken ...
2006-06-21T11:25:00.000Z	nickrud	Ademan	the bot doesn't respond back to you anymore
2008-01-23T08:01:00.000Z	nickrud	Ademan	xorg-dev will pull in all the X development headers, probably will give you what you're looking for
2008-01-23T08:01:00.000Z	Ademan	nickrud	thanks
2008-04-06T03:23:00.000Z	nickrud	Ademan	I kinda thought tiling went out with windows 1
2008-04-06T03:23:00.000Z	Ademan	nickrud	i dunno i really think tiling wm's could do something great for the desktop if someone could just get it right
2008-04-06T03:25:00.000Z	nickrud	Ademan	maybe when everyone has 32" monitors ;)
2008-04-06T03:25:00.000Z	Ademan	nickrud	lol
