2011-08-09T08:46:00.000Z	needhelp1		the wpa supplicat is where i get lost
2011-08-09T08:46:00.000Z	wols	needhelp1	use wicd-curses then
2011-08-09T08:47:00.000Z	wols	needhelp1	or you can simply put it in /etc/network/interfaces and you don't need complicated wpasupplicant configuration (or anything with iwconfig either)
2011-08-09T08:48:00.000Z	needhelp1	wols	hum, i havent heard of this method .. /ect/network/interfaces
2011-08-09T08:48:00.000Z	wols	needhelp1	you have been wronged or why do you need justice?
2011-08-09T08:48:00.000Z	needhelp1	wols	assuming i only have cli access, with no internet connection i couldnt install wicd
2011-08-09T08:49:00.000Z	wols	needhelp1	http://wiki.debian.org/WiFi/HowToUse#WPA-PSK_and_WPA2-PSK  see point 3
2011-08-09T08:49:00.000Z	wols	needhelp1	and I did install wicd and wpasupplicant via usb stick on a debian netinst before
2011-08-09T08:50:00.000Z	needhelp1	wols	true
2011-08-09T08:52:00.000Z	needhelp1	wols	so cat /etc/network/interfaces  shows no mods have been made, im using nmapp doesnt mod the interfaces ?
2011-08-09T08:53:00.000Z	wols	needhelp1	you are assuming right
2011-08-09T08:53:00.000Z	needhelp1	wols	making changes to this file, are they saved forever or do they reset after a reboot
2011-08-09T08:55:00.000Z	needhelp1	wols	so i should .. cp /ect/network/interfaces  /ect/network/interfaces.bak  ?
2011-08-09T08:55:00.000Z	wols	needhelp1	no you should not
2011-08-09T08:55:00.000Z	needhelp1	wols	?
2011-08-09T08:55:00.000Z	wols	needhelp1	any word I wrote unclear?
2011-08-09T08:56:00.000Z	needhelp1	wols	no, could you explain why i should not cp that dir/file ?
2011-08-09T08:56:00.000Z	wols	needhelp1	cause it's not needed
