2004-11-05T07:40:00.000Z	tmpy		yep, there is'nt, AFAIK, thet are LGPL (dual licenced)
2004-11-05T07:42:00.000Z	ogra_	tmpy	do your selfmade packages work ?
2004-11-05T07:43:00.000Z	tmpy		nope, i cant connect to any db and it does'nt exit gracefully (i'm on G3 ppc)
2004-11-05T07:44:00.000Z	ogra_	tmpy	hmm did you recompile the deb packages or did you from source ?
2004-11-05T07:45:00.000Z	tmpy	ogra_	i downloaded the source from mysql site and compiled it from source 
2004-11-05T07:45:00.000Z	ogra_	tmpy	i'd take the deb src ....
2004-11-05T07:46:00.000Z	tmpy		i cant get ubuntu source for it, cause it doesnt show up in deb-src
2004-11-05T07:46:00.000Z	tmpy		orga_: how do i do that?? apt-source? 
2004-11-05T07:47:00.000Z	tmpy		orga_: sry,
2004-11-05T07:47:00.000Z	tmpy		apt-get source :(
2004-11-05T07:48:00.000Z	ogra_	tmpy	get the source from here: http://packages.debian.org/unstable/admin/mysql-admin
2004-11-05T07:49:00.000Z	tmpy		orga_: thx m8 , on it, will see what happens 
2004-11-05T07:49:00.000Z	ogra_	tmpy	the better way would be to send a mail to ubuntu-dev with a package request
