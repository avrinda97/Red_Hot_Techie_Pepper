2007-10-13T08:08:00.000Z	cduby1		I need to set it up so that my keyring for wireless will log me in automagically
2007-10-13T08:08:00.000Z	Flannel	cduby1	you're looking for libpam-keyring
2007-10-13T08:08:00.000Z	cduby1	Flannel	I know.
2007-10-13T08:09:00.000Z	Flannel	cduby1	did you add it to your gdm config?
2007-10-13T08:10:00.000Z	Flannel	cduby1	Do you have the same password for your keyring and your login?
2007-10-13T08:11:00.000Z	Flannel	cduby1	It will upgrade from the *alternate* cd.
2007-10-13T08:12:00.000Z	cduby1	Flannel	yes
2007-10-13T08:12:00.000Z	Flannel	cduby1	and you've added that line to your gdm config, and restarted gdm?
2007-10-13T08:13:00.000Z	cduby1	Flannel	which line?
2007-10-13T08:13:00.000Z	cduby1	Flannel	the echo command?
2007-10-13T08:13:00.000Z	Flannel	cduby1	@include common-pamkeyring
2007-10-13T08:13:00.000Z	Flannel	cduby1	yeah, the echo command adds that line to the end of your gdm config
2007-10-13T08:13:00.000Z	cduby1	Flannel	so add that and then restart the system, or what?
2007-10-13T08:14:00.000Z	Flannel	cduby1	ctrl-alt-backspace.  Restarts X
2007-10-13T08:14:00.000Z	cduby1	Flannel	ah
