2009-03-02T00:39:00.000Z	natschil		hello, I have a package with a broken uninstall script (phpldapadmin), meaning I cannot uninstall the package. Is there a way to do this manually?
2009-03-02T00:40:00.000Z	CarbOon	natschil	you want to unistall phpldapadmin ?
2009-03-02T00:40:00.000Z	CarbOon	natschil	apt-get remove phpldapadmin
2009-03-02T00:42:00.000Z	natschil	CarbOon	yes, I messed up my apache a little, and so I thought I should maybe do apt-get --purge uninstall apache2.2-common and then reinstall it. The problem is that it has all these dependency issues, and phpldapadmin uninstallation crashes with Errors were encountered while processing: phpldapadmin. The problem is that this is unfixable, and that now I can't use apt anymore :(. Any way to just remove it from the package lists and not care about it
2009-03-02T00:42:00.000Z	natschil		anymore?
2009-03-02T00:43:00.000Z	natschil	CarbOon	: I know how to remove packages :)
2009-03-02T00:43:00.000Z	CarbOon		$sudo dpkg -e phpldapadmin
2009-03-02T00:44:00.000Z	natschil	CarbOon	doesn't that extract the package archive?
2009-03-02T00:44:00.000Z	CarbOon	natschil	dpkg -L phpldapadmin .. is showing that list of files with path ?
2009-03-02T00:45:00.000Z	natschil	CarbOon	yes. What should I do now?
2009-03-02T00:45:00.000Z	CarbOon		natshicl.. copy/paste that result on pastebin.com
2009-03-02T00:46:00.000Z	natschil	CarbOon	I would, but I just deleted the lot now :)
2009-03-02T00:46:00.000Z	CarbOon	natschil	you wll hav to remove that root folder which is of that package.
2009-03-02T00:47:00.000Z	natschil	CarbOon	: I did that, but apt still seems to be broken
2009-03-02T00:47:00.000Z	CarbOon	natschil	apt-get clean
2009-03-02T00:48:00.000Z	natschil	CarbOon	why do that, that'll delete all my archives :O
