2009-05-18T09:12:00.000Z	RORgasm		its not there...so i thought maybe it was not installed properly?
2009-05-18T09:13:00.000Z	whatvn	RORgasm	lspci | grep ipw
2009-05-18T09:14:00.000Z	RORgasm	whatvn	when i do 'lscpi | grep ipw ' i get nothing...but when i do 'locate ipw' i see it in serverala locations...but i dunno if it is a complete installation
2009-05-18T09:15:00.000Z	RORgasm	whatvn	does that make sense to u?
2009-05-18T09:16:00.000Z	whatvn	RORgasm	locate don't show driver installed, i think

2009-05-18T09:23:00.000Z	whatvn	RORgasm	ipw2200 driver already provided on Ubuntu, you try again with lspci | grep Wireless

2009-05-18T09:26:00.000Z	RORgasm	whatvn	what do u think?
2009-05-18T09:26:00.000Z	whatvn	RORgasm	I don't have any idea, but It gives you a try. reboot don't take you more time :)
