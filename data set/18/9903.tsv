2007-05-29T06:59:00.000Z	codeyman		which application do i use to convert .mov to .mp3 ?
2007-05-29T06:59:00.000Z	codeyman		yes
2007-05-29T07:00:00.000Z	cables	codeyman	you want to get the audio into a .mp3 file?
2007-05-29T07:00:00.000Z	cables	codeyman	vlc can do it.
2007-05-29T07:00:00.000Z	codeyman	cables	oh..  i'll check it out and get back... thanks
2007-05-29T07:03:00.000Z	codeyman	cables	any idea what should be the bitrate?
2007-05-29T07:03:00.000Z	cables	codeyman	160 is good, 128 is okay, 96 is sorta okay, 64 sucks, 32 is worse, 16 is crap
2007-05-29T07:04:00.000Z	codeyman	cables	i know that :P ..i mean anything is fine for portable media players right?
2007-05-29T07:04:00.000Z	cables	codeyman	VLC sucks as an encoder though
2007-05-29T07:04:00.000Z	cables	codeyman	I'd do this
2007-05-29T07:05:00.000Z	cables	codeyman	use WAV, or at least a really high quality mp3
2007-05-29T07:05:00.000Z	cables	codeyman	then use LAME, which is a high quality mp3 encoder, to re-encode into the quality you want.
2007-05-29T07:05:00.000Z	codeyman	cables	u mean encode as a wav
2007-05-29T07:05:00.000Z	cables	codeyman	yep, then use LAME to encode to mp3 (LAME puts out better mp3s than VLC)
2007-05-29T07:06:00.000Z	cables	codeyman	I can tell you the command to use for LAME
2007-05-29T07:07:00.000Z	codeyman	cables	oh kewl.. so u mean i use vlc to encode mov to wav and then use Lame to convert wav to mp3?
2007-05-29T07:07:00.000Z	cables	codeyman	yep
2007-05-29T07:07:00.000Z	codeyman	cables	thnx.. i'll try that
