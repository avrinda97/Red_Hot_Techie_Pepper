2011-03-17T07:40:00.000Z	edbian	elektroid	What is your question?
2011-03-17T07:41:00.000Z	elektroid	edbian	with my current distro, top and /proc/cpuinfo only give show 1 core, previously, I used Ubuntu 10.04 amd64 and it showed 2 cores, is it just a product of using a 32bit distro?
2011-03-17T07:42:00.000Z	edbian	elektroid	32 vs. 64 bit OS should not make a difference. That is mostly about memory mapping and performance (for apps that take advantage of it)
2011-03-17T07:42:00.000Z	edbian	elektroid	You should def see 2 cores in 32 bit Ubuntu of 64 bit Ubuntu if you have 2 cores
2011-03-17T07:43:00.000Z	elektroid	edbian	thats what I am worried about, is it because a 32bit distro isnt setup to use SMP in the kernel?
2011-03-17T07:44:00.000Z	edbian	elektroid	32 vs 64 bit has no bearing on SMP.  They can both use it.
2011-03-17T07:45:00.000Z	elektroid	edbian	I looked at the kernel config, it does have SMP, I guess I am just trying to figure out why I only have a single core available, worried I am only getting half performance
2011-03-17T07:45:00.000Z	edbian	elektroid	Yes it is very strange...
2011-03-17T07:46:00.000Z	edbian	elektroid	Do you have an nvidia card?  http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1638963
2011-03-17T07:46:00.000Z	elektroid	edbian	nope, ati-amd radeon
2011-03-17T07:47:00.000Z	edbian	elektroid	What is the output of cat /proc/cpuinfo   ?
2011-03-17T07:47:00.000Z	elektroid	edbian	http://pastie.org/1681254
2011-03-17T07:48:00.000Z	edbian	elektroid	one core is missing.  I don't know why though.
