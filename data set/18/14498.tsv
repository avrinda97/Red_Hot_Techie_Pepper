2005-07-30T06:22:00.000Z	Forty|		as C is the backbone for many (and also very successful ) large scale projects
2005-07-30T06:22:00.000Z	Forty|		I choose C++ over C, but still, know that C is only 2nd place to C++
2005-07-30T06:22:00.000Z	Forty|		which still says a lot
2005-07-30T06:24:00.000Z	Forty|		i'm just saying, calling C a language that's not suited for large scale projects, is irresponsible and ignorant
2005-07-30T06:25:00.000Z	Forty|		hehe
2005-07-30T06:25:00.000Z	Forty|		regardless, what did you make with py, i'm done flaming
2005-07-30T06:27:00.000Z	Forty|		back to my file manager question
2005-07-30T06:27:00.000Z	Forty|		anything light that kind of has the ftp feel ?
2005-07-30T06:28:00.000Z	Forty|		i just need to move a lot of folders to an archive and i'm not really in the mood to mv or cp it all
2005-07-30T06:28:00.000Z	Razor-X	Forty|	my favorite File Manager would be Total Commander, Midnight Commander is the Linux CLI port, Krusader is the Linux GUI port
2005-07-30T06:28:00.000Z	Forty|	Razor-X	*vim and C++* comes out punching first
2005-07-30T06:30:00.000Z	Forty|	Razor-X	i know, i just like it to edit my conf files, hehe
2005-07-30T06:31:00.000Z	Razor-X	Forty|	yeah, it is
2005-07-30T06:33:00.000Z	Razor-X	Forty|	or hit Ctrl+Alt+Backspace that does the exact same thing ;)
2005-07-30T06:33:00.000Z	Forty|	Razor-X	not if you're using gdm
2005-07-30T06:58:00.000Z	Forty|	Razor-X	mythtv is actually very easy
2005-07-30T06:59:00.000Z	Razor-X	Forty|	you don't understand, my parents would hate the idea of me touching a circuit board
