2005-03-23T07:59:00.000Z	heze	xav	for example, i can't mount my smb shares on my ubuntu for _some_ reason that i can't figure out. winxp can mount that same share.
2005-03-23T08:00:00.000Z	xav	heze	I had some troubles too
2005-03-23T08:00:00.000Z	heze	xav	got an easy solution? :)

2005-03-23T08:59:00.000Z	heze	xav	you can easily check whether things are fine or not with it. no need to launch q3. it's bad for benchmarking, yes.
2005-03-23T09:00:00.000Z	xav	heze	mattgirv I'm bored to see glxgears score. it makes ppl thinking it means something. that's all
