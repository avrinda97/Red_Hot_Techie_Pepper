2010-01-12T17:57:00.000Z	Andy80		can you please explain me why if Ubuntu Karmic uses PulseAudio, all the guides/howto tell you to configure the alsa-base.conf ?! How ALSA is related to PulseAudio?!
2010-01-12T17:57:00.000Z	erUSUL	Andy80	pulseaudio works on top of alsa audio drivers
2010-01-12T17:58:00.000Z	Andy80	erUSUL	since Pulse is giving me a lot of problems, in particular applications lock the audio among themselves... is there a way to fix it or to use only ALSA?
2010-01-12T17:59:00.000Z	erUSUL	Andy80	that's becouse maybe the apps areot configured to use pulseaudio ?
2010-01-12T18:00:00.000Z	Andy80	erUSUL	this doesn't answer my question :)
2010-01-12T18:00:00.000Z	Andy80	erUSUL	I try to re-formulate.... are you aware of all those PulseAudio problems?
2010-01-12T18:00:00.000Z	erUSUL	Andy80	if the apps are configured to use oss or alsa directly they can block other apps from using the card
2010-01-12T18:01:00.000Z	erUSUL	Andy80	pulseaudio works great for me
2010-01-12T18:01:00.000Z	erUSUL	Andy80	not that i ask much from it.
2010-01-12T18:01:00.000Z	Andy80	erUSUL	ok, this is a reasonable answer... let's try to understand better...
2010-01-12T18:02:00.000Z	Andy80	erUSUL	do you know if wine applications use alsa directly or if they use pulse?
2010-01-12T18:02:00.000Z	erUSUL	Andy80	just make sure that all apps that can be configured on how to use audio are configured to use pulseaudio; esd or alsa
2010-01-12T18:03:00.000Z	erUSUL	Andy80	you can use winecfg to choose what to use. i use ESD
2010-01-12T18:04:00.000Z	Andy80	erUSUL	I mainly use three applications: a windows game that I start with wine (for this reason I'm asking if wine uses alsa directly or if it uses pulse), Firefox+flash plugin (to watch some videos on youtube) and Vagalume, a last.fm client written for Gnome
2010-01-12T18:04:00.000Z	erUSUL	Andy80	vlc has a pulseaudio plugin. in gstreamer-properties you can configure apps that use gstreamer (like totem; RB or banshee) etc...
2010-01-12T18:05:00.000Z	erUSUL	Andy80	for wine do what i said. flash should be compatible with pulse by default; for vagalume (firefly) use gstreamer-properties
2010-01-12T18:06:00.000Z	Andy80	erUSUL	gstreamer-properties let me configure the default audio server for all applications... do I set PulseAudio or do I leave "Default" ?
2010-01-12T18:07:00.000Z	erUSUL	Andy80	default or pulse should work. try changinfg to pulse given that current conf gives you problems
