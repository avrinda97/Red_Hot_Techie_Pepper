2008-04-12T13:45:00.000Z	unop__	solom	see the message from ubotu above
2008-04-12T13:48:00.000Z	unop__	solom	what do you need to know?
2008-04-12T13:52:00.000Z	unop__	solom	well, each business is different, without knowing what your business's infrastructure is like, it's hard to suggest what you should do. tell us more about what your windows machines do at the moment.
2008-04-12T13:54:00.000Z	unop__	solom	it's better we talk in here as other people can learn and also contribute
2008-04-12T14:04:00.000Z	unop__	solom	it'd be better if you did it phase by phase as you said .. first migrate over file and print servers - samba provides this on linux, postfix can replace your domino servers, as for the sql server and applications, mysql can replace this but this might need more work as the applications might need to be ported over to mysql
2008-04-12T14:04:00.000Z	unop__	solom	you'll find it useful if you read a few papers and tutorials on how to migrate over, that will help in the process
2008-04-12T14:09:00.000Z	unop__	solom	i'm not sure a training video will give you enough - the best way to learn this is to do it, setup a lab environment and start to deploy out the technologies you need - the videos can supplement but are not enough
2008-04-12T14:13:00.000Z	solom	unop__	and how newbie Linux user to made it self study dear .. this is not installation windows xp man and just wizard and few click and well done .. volaa windows has been installed with all the package :) .. please tell me exactly what to do in the first phase what exactly do i need example " 2 pc or one pc with VMware ... ubunto server , .. extra "
2008-04-12T14:14:00.000Z	unop__	solom	ubuntu is pretty much the same, pop the CD in boot up, use the wizard, and ubuntu is installed with all the packages needed for a desktop :)
2008-04-12T14:16:00.000Z	unop__	solom	if you are learning, you should try and not use vmware, install ubuntu on it's own parition (see !dualboot) .. if you are setting up a lab to test migration out, well that depends on how many servers you have on the network currently
2008-04-12T14:16:00.000Z	solom	unop__	okay lets stop talking and start the work ... i will burn the cd and start the installation .. after finished i'll get back to you dear
2008-04-12T14:18:00.000Z	unop__	solom	i don't usually give you details like that here -- and it wouldnt be fair if i gave you my ID, #ubuntu here is always available for help if you need it
2008-04-12T14:22:00.000Z	unop__	solom	just acquaint yourself with a dual  boot scenario, thats all
