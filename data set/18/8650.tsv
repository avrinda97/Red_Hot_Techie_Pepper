2007-11-03T00:01:00.000Z	Alejandr0	MilitantPotato	What really makes me think this is totally screwed is the message that says that an impossible to fix problem has occured...
2007-11-03T00:02:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	Alejandr0	yea i've read that from google also
2007-11-03T00:02:00.000Z	Alejandr0	MilitantPotato	do u think if i upgrade to gutsy, this problem might be solved?
2007-11-03T00:02:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	Alejandr0	Have you modifyed your sources list lately?
2007-11-03T00:04:00.000Z	Alejandr0	MilitantPotato	My xp sp2 became totally unstable from what i think was a hardware prob, then ubuntu began crashing and once i got a huge crash which reported lots of error messages, perhaps the configuration was changed there.
2007-11-03T00:05:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	Alejandr0	Well, if it happend after a crash I'd suspect your install is corrupted
2007-11-03T00:07:00.000Z	Alejandr0	MilitantPotato	so i should reinstall feisty?
2007-11-03T00:07:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	Alejandr0	yes, but make sure your hardware issues are fixed
2007-11-03T00:08:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	Alejandr0	but ask someone else, I'd hate for you to reformat if you don't need to.
2007-11-03T00:08:00.000Z	Alejandr0	MilitantPotato	ok, u think im gonna post this on the ubuntuforums, ty.
2007-11-03T00:08:00.000Z	Alejandr0		i think...
2007-11-03T00:08:00.000Z	MilitantPotato	Alejandr0	sounds like a good plan, good luck
