2006-07-14T13:49:00.000Z	jonesie		Help: My system (ubuntu dapper) updated grub before I rebooted last, on reboot the grub menu would not show. I am booted with knoppix live cd. How can I fix grub from this?
2006-07-14T13:50:00.000Z	jonesie		anyone
2006-07-14T13:50:00.000Z	jonesie		?
2006-07-14T13:51:00.000Z	Flannel	jonesie	grub menu is disabled then?  Or what?
2006-07-14T13:51:00.000Z	jonesie	Flannel	I dont know exactly, I guess so
2006-07-14T13:51:00.000Z	Flannel	jonesie	you can push esc to get to the grub menu?  your computer boots fine?
2006-07-14T13:52:00.000Z	jonesie	Flannel	No, im booted with a knoppix live cd. The grub menu wont show
2006-07-14T13:53:00.000Z	Flannel	jonesie	right, but because the menu won't show doesn't mean it wont boot normally.
2006-07-14T13:53:00.000Z	jonesie	Flannel	ok, it probably boots, but the menu is gone.
2006-07-14T13:53:00.000Z	jonesie	Flannel	it just says 'insert diskette press enter' or something to that effect
2006-07-14T13:54:00.000Z	Flannel	jonesie	in the grub configuration, there's an option fo rit.  /boot/grub/menu.lst, comment out the "hiddenmenu" line
2006-07-14T13:56:00.000Z	jonesie	Flannel	It's saying I cannot save it, read only file system.
2006-07-14T13:56:00.000Z	jonesie	Flannel	How can I mount it to read-write?
2006-07-14T13:56:00.000Z	Flannel	jonesie	You should just boot normally and change it that way.
2006-07-14T13:56:00.000Z	Flannel	jonesie	you can push escape when the grub menu is hidden to see it.
2006-07-14T13:57:00.000Z	jonesie	Flannel	I tried that, it just says "insert boot disk and press enter"
2006-07-14T13:57:00.000Z	jonesie	Flannel	well ill try again, brb.
2006-07-14T14:04:00.000Z	jonesie	Flannel	you there?
