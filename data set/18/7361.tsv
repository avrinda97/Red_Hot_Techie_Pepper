2011-01-25T21:05:00.000Z	Gringo		Hey guys how do i install flash player and swfdec and gnash swf players from terminal?
2011-01-25T21:06:00.000Z	Gringo		when i go to certain website it asks me to install them but when i click on install it says something about broken packages but i need it as i cant see the website properly
2011-01-25T21:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Gringo	use: http://pastie.org   to give the output, thanks
2011-01-25T21:05:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Gringo	if you install them all they may fight
2011-01-25T21:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Gringo	sudo apt-get install flashplugin-nonfree gnash swfdec-player-0.8.0   possibly, use: apt-cache search something   to verify
2011-01-25T21:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Gringo	ah then can you run:  sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get upgrade; sudo apt-get --reinstall install nano; echo; lsb_release -a; uname -a
2011-01-25T21:12:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Gringo	if you can give the output of the command I can get your packages square again
2011-01-25T21:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Gringo	use the link I gave, copy the page to the pastebin and hit the paste button. Copy the new address in the address bar and paste it here
2011-01-25T21:16:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Gringo	pastebin is NOT ubuntu specific and can be used in any OS
2011-01-25T21:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Gringo	run the BIG command I gave, copy the tex, go to http://pastie.org and paste the text in the BIG box. Hit the paste button then wait. When the page has changed, copy the address in the address bar of your browser and paste it here
2011-01-25T21:23:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Gringo	ok your packages look fine
2011-01-25T21:23:00.000Z	Gringo	ActionParsnip	what do i do now?
2011-01-25T21:24:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Gringo	ok what is the output of:  dpkg -l | grep flash; dpkg -l | grep swf; dpkg -l | grep gnash     thanks
2011-01-25T21:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Gringo	seems you split the command up for some reason, the command would have outputted a LOT less, seems you don't have flash installed which is fine. Simply install flashplugin-nonfree and you are ok
2011-01-25T21:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Gringo	both will work
2011-01-25T21:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Gringo	run: sudo add-apt-repository ppa:sevenmachines/flash && sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install flashplugin64-installer
2011-01-25T21:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Gringo	gives native 64bit flash rather than using nspluginwrapper nonsense
2011-01-25T21:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Gringo	64bit flash rocks hard
