2010-01-29T14:47:00.000Z	simple_		hey
2010-01-29T14:48:00.000Z	simple_		i'm doing an rsync between two drives using a ubuntu livecd. Speed varies between 100 meg/second and 5meg/second every few minutes
2010-01-29T14:48:00.000Z	simple_		any ideas why?
2010-01-29T14:49:00.000Z	simple_		so this is ok?
2010-01-29T14:49:00.000Z	simple_		i'm doing rsync with checksumming
2010-01-29T14:49:00.000Z	_ruben	simple_	your drives cant handle 100meg/sec most likely ... so while its flushing the data to the disks, the transferspeed will drop drastically
2010-01-29T14:49:00.000Z	simple_		if that makes any difference
2010-01-29T14:49:00.000Z	simple_		hmmm
2010-01-29T14:49:00.000Z	simple_		k
2010-01-29T14:49:00.000Z	simple_	_ruben	this is read speed
2010-01-29T14:50:00.000Z	_ruben	simple_	even with reading, standard drivers dont do 100meg/sec
2010-01-29T14:50:00.000Z	_ruben		s/drivers/drives/
2010-01-29T14:50:00.000Z	simple_		hmmm
2010-01-29T14:50:00.000Z	simple_		kk
2010-01-29T14:51:00.000Z	simple_		in short, tis normal and i should just let it run its course?
2010-01-29T14:51:00.000Z	simple_		does a livecd stop/spin down if i don't use it? (ie. will the transfer slow down when it goes into screensaver mode)
2010-01-29T14:51:00.000Z	simple_		?
2010-01-29T14:53:00.000Z	_ruben	simple_	a drive wont be spun down when its active obviously
