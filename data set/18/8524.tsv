2007-10-01T13:59:00.000Z	cbx33		the /media/disk has changed
2007-10-01T14:00:00.000Z	cbx33		it's owner
2007-10-01T14:00:00.000Z	cbx33		it's owner is now me
2007-10-01T14:00:00.000Z	cbx33		but i still can't write to it
2007-10-01T14:01:00.000Z	cbx33		when i eject it it says it can't eject properly
2007-10-01T14:01:00.000Z	cbx33		i think so yes
2007-10-01T14:01:00.000Z	cbx33		i didn't really wanty to sudo copy it all though
2007-10-01T14:02:00.000Z	dgjones	cbx33	i had a similar problem a couple of weeks ago, after changing group & chmoding a drive, i couldn't write to a mounted partition via nautilus, but I could from a command line and I had to restart the computer so that nautilus picked up the changed settings
2007-10-01T14:02:00.000Z	cbx33	dgjones	ok
2007-10-01T14:02:00.000Z	cbx33		lemme try that
2007-10-01T14:02:00.000Z	dgjones	cbx33	perhaps open a terminal and try to copy a file to the partition to see if you have rights that way before restarting
2007-10-01T14:02:00.000Z	cbx33		thanks dgjones
2007-10-01T14:02:00.000Z	cbx33		it was nautilus it seems
2007-10-01T14:03:00.000Z	cbx33		i'm using rsync anyway
2007-10-01T14:03:00.000Z	dgjones	cbx33	from what i can remember, nautilus picked up the drive settings at boot and didn't update them until a restart
