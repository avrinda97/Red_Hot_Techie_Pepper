2007-09-16T11:20:00.000Z	user01		the first install on this was edgy then i did the update to feisty . . . is it safe to just di the upgrade to gutsy or should i start from scratch with that?
2007-09-16T11:20:00.000Z	dgjones	user01	you might be better asking in #ubuntu+1 about upgrading to gutsy
2007-09-16T11:21:00.000Z	user01	dgjones	 well i mean in general for a new release is it better to just install again from scratch?
2007-09-16T11:23:00.000Z	dgjones	user01	it depends what you've already got installed, whether you've got seperate partitions for /home etc, I do both depending on what i'm upgrading
2007-09-16T11:23:00.000Z	user01	dgjones	 yes i do have separate partitions
2007-09-16T11:24:00.000Z	dgjones	user01	i'd probably do a fresh install rather than an upgrade then
2007-09-16T11:26:00.000Z	user01	dgjones	the home directory woulndt interfere with anything would it?  i mean there would be like personal gnome settings maybe that wouldnt be compatible with the new gnome version?
2007-09-16T11:28:00.000Z	dgjones	user01	not that i know of, whether you do an upgrade via the web, or a fresh install, the installer should pick up the settings from the original /home partition unless you tell it to format over it
2007-09-16T11:28:00.000Z	dgjones		!install | Dynamicc
2007-09-16T11:29:00.000Z	user01	dgjones	 is there a way to get like a file with the packages i have installed right now to remind me to install them?
2007-09-16T11:30:00.000Z	dgjones		!cloning | user01
2007-09-16T11:31:00.000Z	user01	dgjones	 that wont screw anything up with like pidgin having been gaim previously??
2007-09-16T11:31:00.000Z	dgjones	user01	i don't know how things like that'll work i'm afraid
2007-09-16T11:32:00.000Z	user01	dgjones	 because it would be for upgrade
2007-09-16T11:33:00.000Z	user01	dgjones	 sorry what folder is the package list located under?
2007-09-16T11:35:00.000Z	dgjones	user01	i've just tried it and its saved the my-packages in /home
2007-09-16T11:35:00.000Z	user01	dgjones	like if i just wanted to create a text file of installed packages
2007-09-16T11:36:00.000Z	dgjones	user01	the my-packages is a text file, you can open it with gedit or any other text editor
