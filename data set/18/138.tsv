2012-08-11T09:14:00.000Z	Pummel		Can anyone help me with this upgrade error... I've checked the forums and tried a lot but no success:  http://paste.ubuntu.com/1139039/
2012-08-11T09:16:00.000Z	Maccer	Pummel	 Is there more to this output?
2012-08-11T09:29:00.000Z	Pummel	Maccer	- yes, please see http://paste.ubuntu.com/1140522/ for the whole thing...
2012-08-11T09:32:00.000Z	Maccer	Pummel	 Give me a copy of your /etc/apt/sources.lst file
2012-08-11T09:35:00.000Z	Pummel	Maccer	 Here it is http://paste.ubuntu.com/1140524/
2012-08-11T09:37:00.000Z	Maccer	Pummel	 Try running 'sudo rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*'
2012-08-11T09:37:00.000Z	Maccer	Pummel	 And then 'sudo apt-get clean && sudo apt-get update'
2012-08-11T09:41:00.000Z	Pummel	Maccer	 That file is huge, you want the whole thing?
2012-08-11T09:44:00.000Z	Maccer	Pummel	 If you could find lines that contain either "libasound2" or "UsePackage2"
2012-08-11T09:51:00.000Z	Pummel	Maccer	 here you go... is it the " between ok and installed?  http://paste.ubuntu.com/1140542/
2012-08-11T09:52:00.000Z	Maccer	Pummel	 Replace that line with 'Status: install ok installed'
2012-08-11T09:58:00.000Z	Pummel	Maccer	 That fixed the initial problem :)  The reason it got that way was it crashed out of an upgrade from 11 to 12 and I just haven't been working on fixing it until now
2012-08-11T09:58:00.000Z	Maccer	Pummel	 Oh, I guess that makes some sense.
2012-08-11T10:09:00.000Z	Pummel	Maccer	 Now I get this error when I try to upgrade the files I have... http://paste.ubuntu.com/1140549/   is this hopeless?
2012-08-11T10:11:00.000Z	Maccer	Pummel	 Uhh, I don't see an error, just warnings.
2012-08-11T10:18:00.000Z	Pummel	Maccer	 Here is the info for apg from the status file - http://paste.ubuntu.com/1140558/
2012-08-11T10:25:00.000Z	Maccer	Pummel	 I really recommend you check out that debian page though, can I see a copy of git-core though?
2012-08-11T10:27:00.000Z	Pummel	Maccer	 There is no more error of git-core.  You still want me to search for it and past it?
