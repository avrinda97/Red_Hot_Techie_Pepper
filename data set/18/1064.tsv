2011-10-25T14:34:00.000Z	Dynamit		change the super-s button function
2011-10-25T14:34:00.000Z	MindSpark	Dynamit	that's easier said than done. where are the unity configuration options?
2011-10-25T14:34:00.000Z	Dynamit		in Compiz
2011-10-25T14:34:00.000Z	MindSpark		ohe problem
2011-10-25T14:35:00.000Z	MindSpark		that brings me to another huge problem
2011-10-25T14:35:00.000Z	Dynamit		Ubuntu Unity plugin
2011-10-25T14:35:00.000Z	Dynamit		then you will see the hotkey super-s
2011-10-25T14:35:00.000Z	MindSpark		the compiz unity plugin makes the system unusably slow
2011-10-25T14:35:00.000Z	Dynamit		so is not easyer said then done
2011-10-25T14:36:00.000Z	Dynamit	MindSpark	did you see how you will do to be able to change the hotkey?
2011-10-25T14:36:00.000Z	MindSpark		just enabling that plugin brings the computer on its knees
2011-10-25T14:36:00.000Z	Dynamit		if you look in Unity Plugins
2011-10-25T14:36:00.000Z	Dynamit		you will see hotkey super-s
2011-10-25T14:37:00.000Z	Dynamit		no problem
2011-10-25T14:37:00.000Z	MindSpark	Dynamit	I know, but again, something is wrong with that plugin on here. It makes the OS unstable
2011-10-25T14:37:00.000Z	Dynamit		Do a sudo apt-get update;sudo apt-get upgrade --yes
2011-10-25T14:38:00.000Z	Dynamit		it maybe do your computer stable
2011-10-25T14:40:00.000Z	MindSpark	Dynamit	system is up to date
