2012-02-25T09:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wannabemonadist	check the folders in $PATH
2012-02-25T09:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wannabemonadist	you may want to uncomment the last 3 lines so that bash completion works :)
2012-02-25T09:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wannabemonadist	may want to chown to your user too, your cp command will need sudo to
2012-02-25T09:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	wannabemonadist	sudo cp /root/.bashrc $HOME; sudo chown $USER:$USER ~/.bashrc
