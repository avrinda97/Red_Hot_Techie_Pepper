2005-03-18T17:44:00.000Z	hyphen		i got a question if anyone's willing to listen :P
2005-03-18T17:44:00.000Z	topyli	hyphen	ask away
2005-03-18T17:45:00.000Z	topyli	hyphen	which installer is that?
2005-03-18T17:48:00.000Z	topyli	hyphen	they're not exclusive you know
2005-03-18T17:48:00.000Z	topyli	hyphen	linux and windows
2005-03-18T17:49:00.000Z	hyphen	topyli	i wasn't sure how to do two oses on one hd
2005-03-18T17:49:00.000Z	topyli	hyphen	just salvage an old pc and put win98 on it. throw away monitor and keyboard, then run the box via VNC on linux.
2005-03-18T17:49:00.000Z	topyli	hyphen	you can also dual boot with ubuntu
2005-03-18T17:50:00.000Z	hyphen	topyli	so i'd be controlling 2 boxes through 1?
2005-03-18T17:50:00.000Z	topyli	hyphen	it's a bit like pc anywhere on windows (i guess)
2005-03-18T17:51:00.000Z	topyli	hyphen	the other box's desktop is in a window on your main desktop
2005-03-18T17:51:00.000Z	topyli	hyphen	yes. no quake3 :)
2005-03-18T17:51:00.000Z	topyli	hyphen	regular office work and such is fine
2005-03-18T17:52:00.000Z	hyphen	topyli	well i'd be needing to run graphic intensive 3d software
2005-03-18T17:52:00.000Z	topyli	hyphen	ok, no good
2005-03-18T17:52:00.000Z	topyli	hyphen	i'd dual boot or get another box
2005-03-18T17:53:00.000Z	hyphen	topyli	yeah, i think i'm going to dual boot.  how do i go about doing it?
2005-03-18T17:54:00.000Z	topyli	hyphen	i don't remember too well, but basically, you install windows first, then install linux telling it not to destroy windows, and set up the boot loader. the modern installers probably automate most of this
