2007-08-29T09:52:00.000Z	djwonk		when upgrading from dapper to edgy, console-setup prompts me with a graphical window.  i want to automate this process (i.e. for easy server setup).  not sure how after scouring the ubuntu site
2007-08-29T09:54:00.000Z	nickrud	djwonk	look around the debian site, iirc it's something to do with preseeding debconf
2007-08-29T09:54:00.000Z	djwonk	nickrud	i did find mentions of preseeding, but that was a big rabbit hole -- but if you think it will work i'll have another look
2007-08-29T09:55:00.000Z	nickrud	djwonk	it's what they do :) There are tools for that; one that I've heard of is fai , I think
2007-08-29T09:56:00.000Z	nickrud	djwonk	try installing the debconf-doc and looking in that
2007-08-29T09:56:00.000Z	djwonk	nickrud	amazingly, http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/394 is somewhat readable
2007-08-29T09:57:00.000Z	nickrud	djwonk	I like that site, it has a lot of obscure stuff in a readable format
2007-08-29T10:02:00.000Z	djwonk	nickrud	hmmm... it is not clear if I can preseed from `apt-get --assume-yes dist-upgrade`
2007-08-29T10:03:00.000Z	nickrud	djwonk	ah, I see what you're looking for: set your debconf priority to critical; that should kill just about every message. A sec
2007-08-29T10:04:00.000Z	djwonk	nickrud	i appreciate your help.  feed://blog.hjksolutions.com/xml/atom10/feed.xml seems relevant, too
2007-08-29T10:05:00.000Z	nickrud	djwonk	I've danced around this stuff, I really don't grok it well. More a matter of having heard the terminology used by knowledgeable people :)
2007-08-29T10:07:00.000Z	djwonk	nickrud	"set your debconf priority to critical" -- any idea on how to do that? i was thinking that a solution either involves command line switches to apt-get, or some kind of debconf setup, which I know little
2007-08-29T10:08:00.000Z	nickrud	djwonk	so far I've only found info for use during install (which is what I originally thought you were doing, duplicating installs over several machines)
2007-08-29T10:09:00.000Z	djwonk	nickrud	actually, i want to take a prebuilt image (slicehost.com) of dapper and automatically upgrade it to feisty.  the more i read the blog.hjksolutions.com link, the more it makes sense.  apparently you have to install the tools first, do it manually, which records the inputs, then you can "play it back" later.  i hope :)
2007-08-29T10:10:00.000Z	nickrud	djwonk	yes, that's how I read it. I'm leaning towards setting the debconf frontend to non-interactive, reading at the moment
2007-08-29T10:11:00.000Z	nickrud	djwonk	man 7 debconf, look for unattended package installation
2007-08-29T10:17:00.000Z	djwonk	nickrud	cool!  unattended package installation looks a little complicated, but I'll be it would work.  The noninteractive mode is even simpler, if those answers are ok.
2007-08-29T10:17:00.000Z	nickrud	djwonk	note that you'll get mail for bad things that happen, make sure you have a mail delivery setup
