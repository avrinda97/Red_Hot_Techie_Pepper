2004-12-03T10:05:00.000Z	jdub	madsen	not really.
2004-12-03T10:06:00.000Z	madsen	jdub	So the latest (and greatest?) app-versions is in hoary, or...?
2004-12-03T10:07:00.000Z	jdub	madsen	yes
2004-12-03T10:08:00.000Z	madsen	jdub	And can I just to a s/warty/hoary/ in my /etc/apt/sources.list and then apt-get update && apt-get upgrade  and everything will be unstable bliss?
2004-12-03T10:08:00.000Z	jdub	madsen	if you think you can handle it.
2004-12-03T10:08:00.000Z	madsen	jdub	Well, is it more or less unstable than debian sid?
2004-12-03T10:09:00.000Z	jdub	madsen	it is a branch of debian sid, synced regularly, with our changes.
2004-12-03T10:09:00.000Z	madsen	jdub	So it's pretty much about the same?
2004-12-03T10:10:00.000Z	madsen	jdub	I've been running sid for a couple of years now with ~0 problems.
2004-12-03T10:11:00.000Z	madsen	jdub	With alpha-blending and drop-shadows and all?
2004-12-03T10:12:00.000Z	jdub	madsen	that's done by other software, not X.
2004-12-03T10:14:00.000Z	madsen	jdub	?
2004-12-03T10:16:00.000Z	madsen	jdub	Why would I want to reconfigure locals to utf8
2004-12-03T10:16:00.000Z	madsen	jdub	That last one was meant for jdz_ :)
2004-12-03T10:23:00.000Z	jdub	madsen	not atm
2004-12-03T10:24:00.000Z	madsen	jdub	What? Flash?
2004-12-03T10:26:00.000Z	jdub	madsen	no packages.debian.org style interface
2004-12-03T10:26:00.000Z	madsen	jdub	Was I talking about that? (?)
