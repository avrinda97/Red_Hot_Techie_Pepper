2008-02-23T02:54:00.000Z	macogw	chase_	always
2008-02-23T02:55:00.000Z	macogw	chase_	cs189 & i are sitting in our cs189 system administration class right now
2008-02-23T02:56:00.000Z	macogw	chase_	iptables is the firewall. its built into the kernel
2008-02-23T02:56:00.000Z	macogw	chase_	you can modify its rules manually using the iptables command or use a graphical one like firestarter
2008-02-23T02:56:00.000Z	macogw	chase_	all ports are technically open by default, but nothing listens on any of them by default. if you start a service like sshd, itll listen on its port and the rest will reject all data
2008-02-23T02:58:00.000Z	macogw	chase_	nothing listens on any ports by default, so nothing can get in
2008-02-23T02:59:00.000Z	macogw	chase_	if someone was already in there...somehow...like if you installed a trojan or something and it's phoning home... it could send info, but nobody can get in unless there's a service listening (like ssh) and they get in through that service (and ssh is about the only one that's going to let htem execute commands on your box) but by default there's no ssh server installed anyway.  you're 100% secure by default
2008-02-23T02:59:00.000Z	macogw	chase_	at least as far as remote is concerned...
2008-02-23T02:59:00.000Z	macogw	chase_	with physical access, there's no such thing as security
