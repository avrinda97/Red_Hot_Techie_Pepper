2009-07-16T23:09:00.000Z	yoga		I tried to dual boot Ubuntu and Vista.  After intalled Vista, I get "BOOTMGR is compressed" and I cannot boot the system.  How do I recover the system with any Linux tools?
2009-07-16T23:10:00.000Z	sebsebseb	yoga	you put  Vista on after Ubuntu?
2009-07-16T23:11:00.000Z	yoga	sebsebseb	I install Ubuntu first, then Vista.
2009-07-16T23:11:00.000Z	sebsebseb	yoga	right ok so only Vista boots at the moment yes?
2009-07-16T23:11:00.000Z	yoga	sebsebseb	no, the system cannot boot.
2009-07-16T23:12:00.000Z	sebsebseb	yoga	no boot loader?
2009-07-16T23:12:00.000Z	sebsebseb	yoga	if you put  Windows on after  a Linux distro, it goes over the boot loader, so only   Windows can boot
2009-07-16T23:13:00.000Z	yoga	sebsebseb	no, no boot loader, just 'bootmgr is compressed' to reboot Ctl+Alt+DEL
2009-07-16T23:13:00.000Z	sebsebseb	yoga	ok  this sounds like a possible Windows issue,   or  maybe hard disk issue
2009-07-16T23:13:00.000Z	sebsebseb	yoga	Ubuntu was installed first, and then you put Vista on?
2009-07-16T23:14:00.000Z	yoga	sebsebseb	Yes, Ubuntu was intalled first, then Vista.
2009-07-16T23:14:00.000Z	sebsebseb	yoga	and for some reason the Vista boot loader is not working
2009-07-16T23:14:00.000Z	sebsebseb	yoga	ok well normally it's recommended to put Vista on first and then  Linux distro, becasue of how Windows goes  over the Grub boot loader
2009-07-16T23:15:00.000Z	yoga	sebsebseb	yes, it corrupt the bootloader, I think.
2009-07-16T23:16:00.000Z	sebsebseb	yoga	you might have to go to ##windows   if I can't help in pm,  pm since I will go a little off topic for this channel there
2009-07-16T23:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	yoga	no it sounds like your Windows boot loader has gone bad
2009-07-16T23:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	yoga	it won't help putting Grub on
2009-07-16T23:17:00.000Z	sebsebseb	yoga	,because when it comes to booting up Windows, it will use the boot loader you got on there now
