2007-01-02T14:22:00.000Z	bruenig		how do I check a files size from command line
2007-01-02T14:23:00.000Z	michael117	bruenig	du shows how much folders and files are taking up and I forgot what the option was for ls to do the same, but you can just put in man ls and find it
2007-01-02T14:27:00.000Z	bruenig	michael117	thanks, ls -lh will do it
2007-03-23T07:30:00.000Z	bruenig	michael117	I did it on ext3
2007-03-23T07:28:00.000Z	bruenig	michael117	yes you can, you just have to take space off the end of it
2007-03-23T07:29:00.000Z	michael117	bruenig	What file system? I've heard ext3, xfs, jfs, etc... aren't friendly with making partitions smaller, only reiser
2007-03-23T07:30:00.000Z	michael117	bruenig	What program did you use to do it?
2007-03-23T07:30:00.000Z	bruenig	michael117	gparted
2007-03-23T07:33:00.000Z	bruenig	michael117	I could have swore that I have done it before. It was a long time ago though.
