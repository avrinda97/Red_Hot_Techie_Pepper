2009-06-09T12:14:00.000Z	joakimk		I'm having problems with Wikipedia, in Firefox 1.9.0.10. I'm using Ubuntu 8.10, and the math (formulas in Latex) aren't rendered in Wikipedia! Is there anything I can do to fix this?
2009-06-09T12:14:00.000Z	joakimk		Is it a known problem?
2009-06-09T12:14:00.000Z	joakimk		I'm running updates on a regular basis, as Ubuntu tells me to
2009-06-09T12:14:00.000Z	Myrtti	joakimk	it shouldn't have anything to do with your ubuntu
2009-06-09T12:15:00.000Z	joakimk	Myrtti	Firefox, then?
2009-06-09T12:15:00.000Z	Myrtti	joakimk	could you give me a link to an article that you experience this with?
2009-06-09T12:15:00.000Z	joakimk	Myrtti	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fano's_Inequality
2009-06-09T12:16:00.000Z	joakimk	Myrtti	*some* of the math is there, but almost everything in the "Fano's Inequality" paragraph is gone
2009-06-09T12:16:00.000Z	Myrtti	joakimk	they're all png images, so they should work
2009-06-09T12:16:00.000Z	joakimk	Myrtti	well... :)
2009-06-09T12:16:00.000Z	joakimk	Myrtti	The only one working in that section, is "H(e) = − P(e)logP(e) − (1 − P(e))log(1 − P(e))"
2009-06-09T12:17:00.000Z	joakimk	Myrtti	I typed "about:" in the address bar
2009-06-09T12:17:00.000Z	Myrtti	joakimk	have you tried refreshing the page with ctrl-f5?
2009-06-09T12:17:00.000Z	joakimk	Myrtti	yes. the problem is quite persitant
2009-06-09T12:19:00.000Z	joakimk	Myrtti	wireless... but I don't think that could be it...?
2009-06-09T12:20:00.000Z	Myrtti	joakimk	if NetworkManager deals with your network, the interfaces may be up before fstab is read and used, but it will not mean there's network connection available
2009-06-09T12:21:00.000Z	joakimk	Myrtti	I don't follow...
2009-06-09T12:21:00.000Z	Myrtti	joakimk	sorry
