2009-07-16T06:14:00.000Z	thomson		i guess no one else gets a quick flash of a screen full of input/out errors right when their ubuntu 9.04 installtion comes to an end and they hit enter to reboot
2009-07-16T06:15:00.000Z	thomson		ok, i'll ask another question then. what bootloader does ubuntu 9.04 install by default?
2009-07-16T06:15:00.000Z	giiker	thomson	can you paste in the pastebin your errors
2009-07-16T06:16:00.000Z	giiker	thomson	GRUB
2009-07-16T06:23:00.000Z	thomson	giiker	how do i get those errors so i can paste them, does it log them somewhere?
2009-07-16T06:26:00.000Z	thomson	giiker	the errors during install flashed on the screen too fast, so is there a log somewhere?
2009-07-16T06:27:00.000Z	giiker	thomson	can you boot with a live cd?
2009-07-16T06:28:00.000Z	thomson	giiker	i can boot into the install of ubuntu fine, but i just wanted to know what the errors during install were
2009-07-16T06:29:00.000Z	giiker	thomson	get a camera and take a pic, maybe you are just saying normal mesgs, not errors
2009-07-16T06:29:00.000Z	thomson	giiker	it was a quick flash of input/output error
2009-07-16T06:30:00.000Z	thomson	giiker	couldn't see the whole message, went too fast
2009-07-16T06:30:00.000Z	thomson	giiker	i can't generate this again, only happened at the end of installing ubuntu
2009-07-16T06:31:00.000Z	giiker	thomson	have you checked the logs?
2009-07-16T06:31:00.000Z	thomson	giiker	where would they be located?
2009-07-16T06:32:00.000Z	giiker	thomson	system log viewer
2009-07-16T06:33:00.000Z	thomson	giiker	so errors upon installing ubuntu would be logged in the system log viewer?
2009-07-16T06:35:00.000Z	giiker	thomson	I thought You had just installed it
2009-07-16T06:36:00.000Z	thomson	giiker	yep, it's installed, but i was wondering if errors that occur during install can be found in the system log viewer?
