2005-11-21T14:32:00.000Z	zxsykco		I need a to ask a favor of everyone.. if you wouldn't mind helping me, here is my problem..
2005-11-21T14:32:00.000Z	zxsykco		I have an evil mobo with an onboard i810 and I wish to use an ati radeon pci..
2005-11-21T14:32:00.000Z	zxsykco		I've set the bios correctly and everything.
2005-11-21T14:33:00.000Z	zxsykco		The problem is that ubuntu doesn't have an xorgconfig or similar only Xorg -configure..
2005-11-21T14:33:00.000Z	zxsykco		This causes an error as it automagically generates an xorg.conf file that uses the i810 instead of the ati radeon.
2005-11-21T14:33:00.000Z	zxsykco		I am familiar with xorg.conf but not enough to know what I need to change manually in order to correct this.
2005-11-21T14:33:00.000Z	zxsykco		I have the ati card working fine with windows even after having to work aroung the same problem.
2005-11-21T14:34:00.000Z	zxsykco		Any help would be greatly appreciated! ^_^
2005-11-21T14:34:00.000Z	aftertaf	zxsykco	 diable it in bios?
2005-11-21T14:36:00.000Z	zxsykco	aftertaf	Install nvidia-glx and then type sudo nvidia-glx-config enable and restart the xserver.
2005-11-21T14:40:00.000Z	aftertaf	zxsykco	 if you know the name of your ati driver, you can type sudo dpkg-reconfigure -phigh xserver-xorg then swap the module name and remove the bus ID. i did it on a mate's pc
2005-11-21T14:41:00.000Z	zxsykco	aftertaf	How do you remove the busID?
2005-11-21T14:41:00.000Z	aftertaf	zxsykco	 comment it out ---> #
2005-11-21T14:42:00.000Z	aftertaf	zxsykco	 ati is a big mess in ubuntu IMHO ...
2005-11-21T14:44:00.000Z	aftertaf	zxsykco	 cant you put the intel module in blacklist?
2005-11-21T14:45:00.000Z	aftertaf	zxsykco	 hehe i decline all responsibility for consequences  ;)
2005-11-21T14:49:00.000Z	aftertaf	zxsykco	 dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg doesnt do that?
2005-11-21T14:51:00.000Z	aftertaf	zxsykco	 dpkg-reconfigure doesnt ask you which driver you want?
