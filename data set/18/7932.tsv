2011-05-02T17:11:00.000Z	c4pt		can anyone point me somewhere , where i can get compiz fusion working properly with ubuntu classic on 11.04 ?
2011-05-02T17:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	c4pt	 on the login screen. i thought ther ewas a 'classic' and 'classic without effects' (or was it with effects?)  You do have the proper 3d drivers installed?
2011-05-02T17:12:00.000Z	c4pt	Dr_Willis	yes i am using ubuntu classic (the one with effects) and the nvidia binary driver from nvidia (with the module recompiled for the current 11.04 kernel)
2011-05-02T17:13:00.000Z	c4pt	Dr_Willis	but when i enable compiz it doesnt run properly or it crashes
2011-05-02T17:13:00.000Z	c4pt	Dr_Willis	or i get a skewed desktop
2011-05-02T17:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	c4pt	 interesting. Im using nvidia drivers from the repos. I had the compiz stuff with no changes needed I think.
2011-05-02T17:14:00.000Z	c4pt	Dr_Willis	did you install 11.04 clean or did you run a dist-upgrade from update-manager -d ?
2011-05-02T17:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	c4pt	 i almost always do clean installs.
2011-05-02T17:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	c4pt	 so these are clean
2011-05-02T17:15:00.000Z	c4pt	Dr_Willis	this is on a dist-upgrade (-d)
2011-05-02T17:15:00.000Z	c4pt	Dr_Willis	on the alpha 3 compiz was working
2011-05-02T17:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	c4pt	 i even do clean reinstalls from beta. Just to keep things cleaner.
2011-05-02T17:15:00.000Z	c4pt	Dr_Willis	i reinstalled to 10.10 and now 11.04 final came out and i ran dist-upgrade compiz broke after the install
2011-05-02T17:16:00.000Z	c4pt	Dr_Willis	any suggestions? :/
2011-05-02T17:16:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	c4pt	 not really. Ive had no issues with the drivers. or compiz here.
2011-05-02T17:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	c4pt	 clarify what you mean by Skewed.
2011-05-02T17:19:00.000Z	c4pt	Dr_Willis	like on terminal the top of the menu bar disappears and i cant move the window or it rips icons out of firefox making it a major pita to use
2011-05-02T17:21:00.000Z	c4pt	Dr_Willis	hamnegga i had it working for a moment a few hours ago when i made  a new user account but when i enabled composite and opengl in compizconfig-settings-manager it broke again
