2007-06-12T11:06:00.000Z	dawn_chorus	bullgard4	Restricted Drivers Manager
2007-06-12T11:06:00.000Z	bullgard4	dawn_chorus	Thank you very much.
2007-06-12T11:06:00.000Z	dawn_chorus	bullgard4	you're welcome.  What is your native language?
2007-06-12T11:07:00.000Z	bullgard4	dawn_chorus	My native language is German.
2007-06-12T11:08:00.000Z	dawn_chorus	bullgard4	but #ubuntu is always glad to help.
2007-06-12T11:09:00.000Z	bullgard4	dawn_chorus	i.) The German channel #ubuntu-de is still sleeping. ii.) The German channel #ubuntu-de does not have first-hand knowledge of English proper terms.
2007-06-12T11:09:00.000Z	dawn_chorus	bullgard4	I'll help in any way I can.
2007-06-12T11:11:00.000Z	bullgard4	dawn_chorus	When clicking the Gnome menu item hierarchy System > Administration > Restricted Drivers Manager, what will be the name of the title line of the window that appears then?
2007-06-12T11:13:00.000Z	dawn_chorus	bullgard4	i cannot recall and i cannot recreate it right now.  ask your question again to the room, without having my name prefixed.
2007-06-12T11:13:00.000Z	bullgard4	dawn_chorus	I will do. Thank you.
2007-06-16T12:02:00.000Z	dawn_chorus	bullgard4	looks like stuff that's resumed after hibernation, maybe.
2007-06-16T12:03:00.000Z	bullgard4	dawn_chorus	Can you elaborate on 'stuff that's resumed'. That directory of course contains files.
2007-06-16T12:04:00.000Z	dawn_chorus	bullgard4	right.  looks to be scripts that are initiated after coming out of sleep/hibernate (or whatever, I don't use these functions).
2007-06-16T12:06:00.000Z	bullgard4	dawn_chorus	No, I disagree. One file of them is called 'sleep.sh', and this certainly is not initiated just after coming out of sleep.
2007-06-16T12:08:00.000Z	dawn_chorus	bullgard4	well, quite frankly, i just googled the directory name and looked around.  it's script concerning these or similar functions, etc.
2007-06-16T12:09:00.000Z	bullgard4	dawn_chorus	Thank you very much for trying to help me out.
2007-06-16T12:09:00.000Z	dawn_chorus	bullgard4	no sweat man.  i like to learn tracking stuff down.
