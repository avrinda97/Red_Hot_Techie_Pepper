2009-05-31T00:12:00.000Z	istvan		grub has errors when i install ubuntu 904
2009-05-31T00:12:00.000Z	istvan		it fails to instal
2009-05-31T00:14:00.000Z	istvan		i un-installed python by accident (didn't realize another version wasn't installed) - it took almost all my aps with it. I have backups, but is there another way to recover?
2009-05-31T00:15:00.000Z	istvan		my backup software wash removed along with python so i'd ned a clean install
2009-05-31T00:15:00.000Z	del_diablo	istvan	sudo apt-ge install python
2009-05-31T00:15:00.000Z	del_diablo	istvan	* sudo apt-get install python
2009-05-31T00:15:00.000Z	istvan	del_diablo	i can't, if i do that from the recover command line i get errors
2009-05-31T00:16:00.000Z	istvan		the error is E: unmet dependencies
2009-05-31T00:16:00.000Z	del_diablo	istvan	recovery cmd? Why not in a terminal in normal loggin?
2009-05-31T00:16:00.000Z	istvan		because terminal was also removed
2009-05-31T00:17:00.000Z	del_diablo	istvan	are you on wireless network?
2009-05-31T00:19:00.000Z	del_diablo	istvan	if you are not then hitting ctrl+alt+F2 and then loggin inn then doing the install using apt-get--------- then using alt + left arrowkey to get back to the main Desktop window with grapics?
2009-05-31T00:19:00.000Z	istvan	del_diablo	i just got that to work. python is installed. is there a way for me to put all my apps back?
2009-05-31T00:20:00.000Z	istvan		without doing each manually?
2009-05-31T00:20:00.000Z	istvan		there were hundreds of dependencies and apps removed
2009-05-31T00:20:00.000Z	del_diablo	istvan	i dunno. If you got your python back then just starting them could work
2009-05-31T00:21:00.000Z	istvan		can i see a log of the apt-get operations?
2009-05-31T00:21:00.000Z	del_diablo	istvan	i wish i knew <.< Just reinstalling python and in worst case a system reboot should be magical
