2012-10-17T09:32:00.000Z	Daughain		Out of curiosity, can anyone tell me why update manager might stall out?
2012-10-17T09:32:00.000Z	yigal	Daughain	a repository might be having issues
2012-10-17T09:33:00.000Z	yigal	Daughain	what is the current output?
2012-10-17T09:33:00.000Z	yigal	Daughain	where is it stalling?
2012-10-17T09:33:00.000Z	Daughain	yigal	"setting up linux-image-generic (2.6.35.32.42)
2012-10-17T09:34:00.000Z	yigal	Daughain	interesting it is stalling on installing a new kernel
2012-10-17T09:34:00.000Z	Daughain	yigal	Just did a fresh install of 10.10 and trying to update before upgrading to 11.04.
2012-10-17T09:35:00.000Z	yigal	Daughain	what type of system are you working on?
2012-10-17T09:36:00.000Z	Daughain	yigal	This also makes the third time it has stalled out like this on the new kernel today.
2012-10-17T09:37:00.000Z	yigal	Daughain	I would strongly consider installing this via the command line
2012-10-17T09:37:00.000Z	yigal	Daughain	to get a better idea of what exactly is going on
2012-10-17T09:38:00.000Z	Daughain	yigal	kinda noticing that, the question is, what, if anything, I can do other than starting the install from scratch once more?
2012-10-17T09:39:00.000Z	yigal	Daughain	what does the info. tell you currently what is the exact line it is stalling on currently?
2012-10-17T09:40:00.000Z	Daughain	yigal	once again, "Setting up linux-image-generic . (2.6.3.32.42)"
2012-10-17T09:41:00.000Z	Daughain	yigal	and the sysmon is showing no activity on the proccy.
2012-10-17T09:41:00.000Z	yigal	Daughain	have you run a top on the cli?
2012-10-17T09:42:00.000Z	yigal	Daughain	is the cpu being utilized for something else ?
2012-10-17T09:43:00.000Z	yigal	Daughain	this is likely not true, please as run "sudo ps aufx" are there any processes running?
