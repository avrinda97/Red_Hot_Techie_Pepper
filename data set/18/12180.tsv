2006-06-02T13:16:00.000Z	ajax4	Warbo	I got this error when I issued "sudo nvidia-glx-config enable" http://pastebin.com/752988
2006-06-02T13:17:00.000Z	Warbo	ajax4	That just means that your /etc/X11/xorg.conf file isn't standard, so the tool can't change it. I don't use that tool anyway, I edit it manually
2006-06-02T13:18:00.000Z	ajax4	Warbo	How is my xorg.conf not standard. I just installed Dapper?
2006-06-02T13:18:00.000Z	Warbo	ajax4	I don't know, but just edit it yourself. Put "driver" in your device section as "nvidia"
2006-06-02T13:19:00.000Z	ajax4	Warbo	then what?
2006-06-02T13:19:00.000Z	Warbo	ajax4	Restart X and see what errors you get :)
2006-06-02T13:20:00.000Z	ajax4	Warbo	Driver is currently "nv" should I change it to "nvidia"?
2006-06-02T13:20:00.000Z	Warbo	ajax4	Yes
2006-06-02T13:21:00.000Z	ajax4	Warbo	ok, I'll try that now.
2006-06-02T13:26:00.000Z	ajax4	Warbo	I tried it and it worked. Thanks!!
2006-06-02T13:26:00.000Z	Warbo	ajax4	Yay!
2006-06-02T13:27:00.000Z	ajax4	Warbo	Now I'm gonna hold my breath and dive into getting Xgl to work. Wish me luck! :)
2006-06-02T13:27:00.000Z	Warbo	ajax4	Good luck (but I don't like it myself)
2006-06-02T13:27:00.000Z	ajax4	Warbo	Why not?
2006-06-02T13:28:00.000Z	Warbo	ajax4	Doesn't have enough windows manager features I am used to (I think the latest one does, but that's only in like Gentoo or something)
2006-06-02T13:30:00.000Z	Warbo	ajax4	Oh yeah, you may want to add the line: Option "NoLogo" "true" under the driver line to get rid of the annoying spash screen
2006-06-02T13:31:00.000Z	ajax4	Warbo	Good idea. Thanks a lot for your help :)
