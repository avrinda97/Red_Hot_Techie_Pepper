2005-06-16T09:16:00.000Z	bob2	toonx	no
2005-06-16T09:16:00.000Z	toonx	bob2	uhmm , what happends if i do?
2005-06-16T09:17:00.000Z	bob2	toonx	then you'll get to fix it yourself, since debian and ubuntu people will tell you to go away
2005-06-16T09:17:00.000Z	toonx	bob2	apt-get update seems not to be bodered..
2005-06-16T09:17:00.000Z	bob2	toonx	of course
2005-06-16T09:17:00.000Z	toonx	bob2	uhm , i dont get it , if its starts with deb why ther's no common support?
2005-06-16T09:18:00.000Z	bob2	toonx	because you're making some mix that no one else has
2005-06-16T09:18:00.000Z	bob2	toonx	if you don't understand what the problem is, you won't understand how to fix it
2005-06-16T09:19:00.000Z	toonx	bob2	makes sense, but what i dont get it is what there is no common support for something that has the same root
2005-06-16T09:19:00.000Z	bob2	toonx	you're welcome to start providing it
2005-06-16T09:19:00.000Z	toonx	bob2	;)
2005-06-16T09:19:00.000Z	toonx	bob2	or if they are so different one from the other why does ubuntu repositories start with deb ?
2005-06-16T09:20:00.000Z	toonx	bob2	no offense mate, im just asking some silly questions maybe
2005-06-16T09:20:00.000Z	bob2	toonx	you mean in /etc/apt/sources.list? because that's the format for sources.list.
2005-06-16T09:21:00.000Z	toonx	bob2	yes sources.list i ment, i see now .. there's now real answer
2005-06-16T09:22:00.000Z	bob2	toonx	the real answer is "Of course yo ucan use Debian packages on ubuntu, but you'll break if you don't know what you're doing."
2005-06-16T09:23:00.000Z	toonx	bob2	thanks dude, that was what i wanted to know
