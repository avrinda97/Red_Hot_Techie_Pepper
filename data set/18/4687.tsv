2009-10-29T07:13:00.000Z	gogeta		hi i cant get vbox to use a real partation
2009-10-29T07:13:00.000Z	gogeta		it crashes
2009-10-29T07:15:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	gogeta	i'd recommend asking in #vbox instead of #ubuntu
2010-03-17T23:57:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	gogeta	Ubuntu does not use a "rolling release" system (so packages are not version updated during a release - Firefox 3.6 as another example), you could check if a PPA contains the newer version.

2010-04-19T07:08:00.000Z	gogeta	ZykoticK9	why it worked for me i guess
2010-04-21T06:07:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	gogeta	sje46 was the youtube questioner
2010-04-25T11:11:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	gogeta	kishor666 rather then using rc, wait till thursday to get lucid final
2010-04-26T04:56:00.000Z	gogeta	ZykoticK9	oh i hate you
2010-04-26T04:56:00.000Z	gogeta	ZykoticK9	after i just had him do a manul extrack
2010-04-26T04:57:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	gogeta	sorry - i was just reported that i was successful, didn't mean to step on any toes, or get in the way of troubleshooting
2010-04-26T04:58:00.000Z	gogeta	ZykoticK9	normaly lack of sudo wouuld give a diffrent error
2010-04-26T05:01:00.000Z	gogeta	ZykoticK9	its due to him being 64bit
2010-04-26T05:03:00.000Z	gogeta	ZykoticK9	kinda a quick and dirty way but hell if it works
2010-04-26T05:04:00.000Z	ZykoticK9	gogeta	that library is really outdated - thus it's removal from Karmic, but yes certainly dirty
