2009-09-14T10:08:00.000Z	caustic		I really don't need to be trying to give advice....i'm a newbie myself...I just don't want to see someone go unanswered ;)
2009-09-14T10:08:00.000Z	caustic		*shrug* just leaped over my knowledge
2009-09-14T10:09:00.000Z	caustic		when i was first trying ubuntu, i had something with avahi somewhere...good thing that live CD makes for an easy reinstall
2009-09-14T10:10:00.000Z	caustic		oh i wasn't feeling ignored
2009-09-14T10:12:00.000Z	caustic		but i will ask my question again....how can i get samba network shares to show up in open file dialogs for various programs such as K3B?
2009-09-14T10:12:00.000Z	jmarsden	caustic	They already do, they are simply mount points whereever you mounted them... /media/myshare1 or whatever
2009-09-14T10:13:00.000Z	caustic	jmarsden	I would have thought that, dolphin is giving me issues makeing a mount point
2009-09-14T10:13:00.000Z	jmarsden	caustic	what is dolphin and why would you be using it to make a mount point, just use mkdir for that :)
2009-09-14T10:13:00.000Z	caustic	jmarsden	says it can't find my server
2009-09-14T10:14:00.000Z	jmarsden	caustic	If you type the command     mount    do you see the shares there ?
2009-09-14T10:14:00.000Z	caustic	jmarsden	dolphen is default KDE file manager.  still a little shaky on command line IF there is a GUI program that will make all the settings for me
2009-09-14T10:15:00.000Z	caustic	jmarsden	let's find out
2009-09-14T10:15:00.000Z	jmarsden	caustic	It's harder to do IRC support for GUI stuff, easier to tell people what to type than where to click :)
2009-09-14T10:16:00.000Z	caustic	jmarsden	you make a fair point.
2009-09-14T10:17:00.000Z	caustic	jmarsden	how about if I back up a step.  Can I use a network location in an open dialog like i would use smb://192.168.1.150/ to click through to the directories i need?
2009-09-14T10:19:00.000Z	caustic	jmarsden	heh I think i'll just bite it and drop to command prompt and mount it from there :)
2009-09-14T10:19:00.000Z	jmarsden	caustic	That all depends on the app concerned and whether it handles smb: style .  It is usually easier to mount the shares you want and then open them as part of the Linux file tree, in my experience.
2009-09-14T10:19:00.000Z	jmarsden	caustic	Good choice :)
