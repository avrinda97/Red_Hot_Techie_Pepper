2006-08-25T08:33:00.000Z	Bacta		the guys having similar probs but nothing suggested there works for me
2006-08-25T08:35:00.000Z	Bacta		are you sure its the same chip?
2006-08-25T08:35:00.000Z	Bacta		because this is a windows machine all over...stickers and all lol
2006-08-25T08:36:00.000Z	Bacta		czerkacorp: starwars lol
2006-08-25T08:36:00.000Z	Bacta		so why hasn't anybody told me about this in the days i have been asking people?
2006-08-25T08:37:00.000Z	Bacta		i assume recompiling a kernel is harder than my computer science algorithms assignment?
2006-08-25T08:38:00.000Z	Bacta		do i need to hack the C code?
2006-08-25T08:38:00.000Z	Bacta		and how can I recompile it when I am using the kernel to run my system lol
2006-08-25T08:39:00.000Z	Bacta		it just annoys me that Ubuntu works so well on all the other laptops i have installed it on but this
2006-08-25T08:40:00.000Z	Bacta		so what new stuff do i need to compile into the kernel?
2006-08-25T08:41:00.000Z	Flannel	Bacta	did you see the link ubotu sent you?  it gives you all instructions on recompiling
2006-08-25T08:41:00.000Z	Bacta	Flannel	yes...and it also tells me if i just need a new driver i shouldn't have to recompile
2006-08-25T08:42:00.000Z	Flannel	Bacta	that's usually true, yeah.  You need to know what hardware you need the driver for, and then poke around on google/etc to get instructions on installing those drivers
2006-11-28T08:38:00.000Z	Flannel	Bacta	yes, those are all installable.
2006-11-28T08:40:00.000Z	Flannel	Bacta	it can, sure.
2006-11-28T08:40:00.000Z	Flannel	Bacta	after setup is easiest.
2006-11-28T08:42:00.000Z	Flannel	Bacta	yes.
2007-05-03T13:02:00.000Z	Flannel	Bacta	feisty was released a few weeks ago, yes.
