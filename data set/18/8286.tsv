2010-05-31T18:36:00.000Z	loic		okay I'll try to sum up my problem again sorry but I really do need help, I checked wikis, google... and I've been on the same issue for hours now. I just want my laptop to boot up in a correct resolution "1024x768" instead of "1600x1200". Here's my xorg.conf http://pastebin.com/as3JvpMM and the interestings parts of xorg logs (lines 16 and 34 to 36 in particular). What am I doing wrong ? help me please
2010-05-31T18:37:00.000Z	coz_	loic	 out of curiosity  which video card...    lspci | grep -i vga
2010-05-31T18:38:00.000Z	loic	coz_	: 01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: VIA Technologies, Inc. K8M800/K8N800/K8N800A [S3 UniChrome Pro] (rev 01)
2010-05-31T18:39:00.000Z	coz_	loic	 ooo   unichrome.... ah I know very little about unichrome chips... or the drivers  hold on let me check
2010-05-31T18:39:00.000Z	loic	coz_	: once it has booted I have to do alt F2 then type "xrandr -s 1024x768" and then it's perfect... Im sure there's a way I can tell xorg.conf to do that automatically
2010-05-31T18:39:00.000Z	coz_	loic	 well did you find a driver for that ?
2010-05-31T18:40:00.000Z	loic	coz_	: openchrome ?
2010-05-31T18:40:00.000Z	coz_	loic	  I would assume
2010-05-31T18:40:00.000Z	loic	coz_	: without xorg.conf everything works fine except I have to manually change the resolution at startup
2010-05-31T18:40:00.000Z	coz_	loic	 mmm... I assume you saw this page?   https://help.ubuntu.com/community/OpenChrome
2010-05-31T18:42:00.000Z	loic	coz_	: can it be related to this weird (II) CHROME(0): ViaPanelGetNativeModeFromOption in xorg.log ? the link you gave is outdated...
2010-05-31T18:43:00.000Z	coz_	loic	 yeah I know the link is outdated..unfortunately... I am going to assume that the driver needs to be installed properly.... at least in order to fix the resolution issue
2010-05-31T18:44:00.000Z	loic	coz_	: can it be not properly installed and works this good ? the only problem is the default autodetected resolution is wrong...
2010-05-31T18:45:00.000Z	coz_	loic	 ok  I am going to suggest going to the ##linux channel...they have a braoder base of knowledge there and might be able to straighten this out for you
2010-05-31T18:45:00.000Z	loic	coz_	: I think the startup script with xrandr sounds an easier solution than compiling latest drivers and stuff for such a small issue ...
2010-05-31T18:46:00.000Z	coz_	loic	 ok
2010-05-31T18:48:00.000Z	loic	coz_	: I didn't send the link to my xorg logs properly : http://pastebin.com/u5J5JHJF can you tell me what you think of lines 16 and 34-36 ?
2010-05-31T18:52:00.000Z	loic	coz_	: im the only one talking in ##linux ... :(
