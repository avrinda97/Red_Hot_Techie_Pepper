2011-07-26T14:29:00.000Z	bugbrains		which is best C++ process communication library for ubuntu
2011-07-26T14:29:00.000Z	bugbrains		i need to read the stdout of a process using C++
2011-07-26T14:30:00.000Z	fmauro	bugbrains	piping the output of it is not an option?
2011-07-26T14:30:00.000Z	bugbrains	fmauro	i execute a process and it prints some text on sucees of failure to stdout
2011-07-26T14:30:00.000Z	bugbrains		i need it in a c++ code
2011-07-26T14:32:00.000Z	fmauro	bugbrains	you could implement it as a return code. or is the returned text of importance?
2011-07-26T14:32:00.000Z	bugbrains	fmauro	 returned text
2011-07-26T14:32:00.000Z	bugbrains		is important
2011-07-26T14:32:00.000Z	fmauro	bugbrains	let me think.
2011-07-26T14:35:00.000Z	fmauro	bugbrains	you could use popen from stdio.h
2011-07-26T14:36:00.000Z	bugbrains	fmauro	i will try and come back
2011-07-26T14:57:00.000Z	fmauro	bugbrains	I put some code together quickly, hope it helps http://paste.ubuntu.com/652349/
2011-07-26T14:58:00.000Z	bugbrains	fmauro	your help is well appreciated :)
2011-07-26T15:03:00.000Z	fmauro	bugbrains	note that this will only print stdout and not stderr. you have to append 2>&1 for that
2011-07-26T15:08:00.000Z	bugbrains	fmauro	how to get stderr
2011-07-26T15:09:00.000Z	fmauro	bugbrains	instead of for example "ls -r" use "ls -r 2>&1" as argument for popen()
2011-07-26T15:10:00.000Z	bugbrains	fmauro	ok the it will give both stdout and stderr on variable output
2011-07-26T15:11:00.000Z	fmauro	bugbrains	afaik yes
