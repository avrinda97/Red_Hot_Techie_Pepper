2007-12-17T03:48:00.000Z	batma8		hey guys..ive tried installing all versions of ubuntu 64 bit and it will install..but when i put another stick of ram in..it locks
2007-12-17T03:49:00.000Z	batma8		both sticks pass memtest
2007-12-17T03:49:00.000Z	batma8		any ideas?
2007-12-17T03:49:00.000Z	ikonia	batma8	sounds like hardware errors
2007-12-17T03:49:00.000Z	ikonia	batma8	how big are the sticks ? are they paired ? are they overclocked ?
2007-12-17T03:49:00.000Z	ikonia	batma8	the gefore 7600 we can progress
2007-12-17T03:50:00.000Z	ikonia	batma8	how big are the memory sticks ?
2007-12-17T03:51:00.000Z	ikonia	batma8	thats 3 sticks
2007-12-17T03:51:00.000Z	ikonia	batma8	and what about the 2 x 1gig sticks
2007-12-17T03:52:00.000Z	ikonia	batma8	it sounds like the second memory controller is having an issue
2007-12-17T03:52:00.000Z	ikonia	batma8	is this an amd or intel cpu
2007-12-17T03:52:00.000Z	ikonia	batma8	so the controller is on the chip
2007-12-17T03:52:00.000Z	ikonia	batma8	is this overclocked in any way shape or form
2007-12-17T03:53:00.000Z	ikonia	batma8	what happens when you try to use ubuntu with 2 or 3 sticks in.
2007-12-17T03:54:00.000Z	ikonia	batma8	define locks please, just so we are clear
2007-12-17T03:54:00.000Z	ikonia	batma8	does the keyboard numlock go on / off with numlock button
2007-12-17T03:55:00.000Z	ikonia	batma8	does the window manager respond to ctrl+alt+backspace
2007-12-17T03:55:00.000Z	ikonia	batma8	ok, so what you need to do is reboot using safe mode and tell me how that works ?
