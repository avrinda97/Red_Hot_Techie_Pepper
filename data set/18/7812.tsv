2007-11-20T13:02:00.000Z	newguy	xivanari	sudo apt-get install compizconfig-settings-manager
2007-11-20T13:03:00.000Z	xivanari	newguy	i have already installed that and am working in it
2007-11-20T13:03:00.000Z	xivanari	newguy	just trying to figure out how to get it working within that
2007-11-20T13:04:00.000Z	newguy	xivanari	what would you like to get working?
2007-11-20T13:05:00.000Z	newguy	xivanari	to switch workspaces by scrolling the mouse wheel?
2007-11-20T13:05:00.000Z	newguy	xivanari	i find it works when theres no windows on the desktop, but once i have a window open, the mouse wheel doesnt switch workspace
2007-11-20T13:06:00.000Z	xivanari	newguy	well before i somehow messed this up it was working.
2007-11-20T13:06:00.000Z	xivanari	newguy	and i could havbe windows open
2007-11-20T13:07:00.000Z	newguy	xivanari	in the compizconfig settings manager, what tab are you looking in?
2007-11-20T13:07:00.000Z	newguy	xivanari	ah no its ok, i see it
2007-11-20T13:08:00.000Z	xivanari	newguy	under the first tab the options are rotate and initiate
2007-11-20T13:09:00.000Z	newguy	xivanari	hmm, i wonder what the name is for the mouse wheel though, otherwise id put that into the "move next" selection under "Desktop-based Viewport Switching" in the actions tab
2007-11-20T13:10:00.000Z	newguy	xivanari	ya, mines got "button 5"
2007-11-20T13:11:00.000Z	xivanari	newguy	well i somehow habve that there but it isnt working!
2007-11-20T13:13:00.000Z	xivanari	newguy	tried to get the widget layer setup as well but it isnt working either
2007-11-20T13:13:00.000Z	xivanari	newguy	it appears as though all of the changes i make in ccsm dont actually get applied.
2007-11-20T13:14:00.000Z	newguy	xivanari	ya i found it a bit tricky, sometimes theres settings in other areas that need to be tweaked to take effect
2007-11-20T13:16:00.000Z	xivanari	newguy	ok now it is working partially, it has the little icon on the bottom righthand corner of the panel
