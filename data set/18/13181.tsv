2009-06-29T21:12:00.000Z	TD-Linux		gaaaah, I'm angry now, don't fix stuff that isn't broke: thought I'd install flash 10 so I removed flashplugin-nonfree and installed adobe-flashplugin from their site, but now firefox doesn't detect it and it displays a white screen in konqueror 3.5.10
2009-06-29T21:13:00.000Z	TD-Linux		in addition, flash 10 does not appear as a plugin at all in firefox
2009-06-29T21:13:00.000Z	TD-Linux		no matter what I do, I can't get firefox to detect the plugin
2009-06-29T21:14:00.000Z	lesshaste	TD-Linux	hmm... check it's in the right directory for firefox
2009-06-29T21:15:00.000Z	lesshaste	TD-Linux	I had a similar problem that was fixed by fixing the directory problem
2009-06-29T21:17:00.000Z	TD-Linux	lesshaste	can you elaborate?
2009-06-29T21:17:00.000Z	lesshaste	TD-Linux	It put the files in the wrong place. I think I just copied them over to where the plugins that firefox did recognise where
2009-06-29T21:17:00.000Z	lesshaste	TD-Linux	so do about:plugins, see what it does find
2009-06-29T21:17:00.000Z	lesshaste	TD-Linux	and out the flash 10 stuff in there with it
2009-06-29T21:18:00.000Z	TD-Linux	lesshaste	didn't find anything in about:plugins
2009-06-29T21:18:00.000Z	lesshaste	TD-Linux	nothing at all??
2009-06-29T21:19:00.000Z	lesshaste	TD-Linux	you are putting this in the url box in firefox right?
2009-06-29T21:19:00.000Z	TD-Linux	lesshaste	yes
2009-06-29T21:19:00.000Z	lesshaste	TD-Linux	and it sees zero plugins?
2009-06-29T21:19:00.000Z	lesshaste	TD-Linux	fine.. so work out where those are
2009-06-29T21:20:00.000Z	lesshaste	TD-Linux	GCJ in particular
2009-06-29T21:22:00.000Z	lesshaste	TD-Linux	it'll also be in a plugins directory..just find all the directories called plugins
2009-06-29T21:23:00.000Z	lesshaste	TD-Linux	:)
