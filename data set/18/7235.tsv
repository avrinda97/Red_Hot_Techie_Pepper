2008-10-02T09:48:00.000Z	jenny		i can remeber the command that will tell me...do u know it?
2008-10-02T09:48:00.000Z	tritium	jenny	lspci -v may help you find it
2008-10-02T10:07:00.000Z	tritium	jenny	it will still work
2008-10-02T10:11:00.000Z	jenny	tritium	﻿nd what was the command again..and i need to run as super user..so do i just put sudo before it?
2008-10-02T10:11:00.000Z	tritium	jenny	what are you trying to do?
2008-10-02T10:12:00.000Z	tritium	jenny	you don't need sudo to use "lspci"
2008-10-02T10:13:00.000Z	tritium	jenny	you can also try "lshw -class sound"
2008-10-02T10:16:00.000Z	tritium	jenny	you'd have to look carefully at the output of "lspci -v"
2008-10-02T10:17:00.000Z	tritium	jenny	regarding your 2nd question, "sudo lshw -class sound"
