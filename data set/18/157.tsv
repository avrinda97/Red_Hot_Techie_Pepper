2012-07-16T14:59:00.000Z	65MAAWBMU		How can I unmount a read-only filesystem?
2012-07-16T14:59:00.000Z	L3top	65MAAWBMU	umount
2012-07-16T15:00:00.000Z	65MAAWBMU		I do that, it's content, but df still lists it.
2012-07-16T15:00:00.000Z	L3top	65MAAWBMU	try umount -lf... being read only makes no difference.
2012-07-16T15:03:00.000Z	L3top	65MAAWBMU	I would also care what mount says, not df.
2012-07-16T15:04:00.000Z	65MAAWBMU		mount says /dev/sda1 is mounted on /
2012-07-16T15:04:00.000Z	65MAAWBMU		with (rw, errors=remount-ro)
2012-07-16T15:04:00.000Z	65MAAWBMU		Even after I did umount.
2012-07-16T15:11:00.000Z	65MAAWBMU		Ubuntu can't mount it, either...
2012-07-16T15:12:00.000Z	65MAAWBMU		How can I fix /etc/fstab back?
2012-07-16T15:12:00.000Z	65MAAWBMU		Fair enough
2012-07-16T15:15:00.000Z	65MAAWBMU		I edited fstab but didn't edit menu.lst as well, and now Ubuntu can't mount / during boot, it says, and that's that. I can't edit fstab back because it's read-only
2012-07-16T15:19:00.000Z	65MAAWBMU		I think the whole filesystem, but I'm not sure how to tell.
2012-07-16T15:19:00.000Z	65MAAWBMU		/proc/mounts says / is rw...
2012-07-16T15:20:00.000Z	65MAAWBMU		I'm in the root repair console thing, root@laptop
2012-07-16T15:23:00.000Z	65MAAWBMU		Ok
2012-07-16T15:27:00.000Z	L3top	65MAAWBMU	mount -o remount,rw /
2012-07-16T15:31:00.000Z	65MAAWBMU	L3top	fixed it with "mount --no-mtab -o remount,rw /dev/sda1 /" woo :)
