2008-12-01T00:29:00.000Z	n8tuser		abarbaccia-> how do you know it connects to the AP? what command you used?
2008-12-01T00:30:00.000Z	abarbaccia	n8tuser	it gets an ip address and everything
2008-12-01T00:32:00.000Z	abarbaccia	n8tuser	sorry. its all coming from the netapplet. its able to pull an IP correctly. I can post those that you wanted in a minute
2008-12-01T00:50:00.000Z	abarbaccia	n8tuser	here's the network command outputs: http://paste.ubuntu.com/78405/
2008-12-01T00:51:00.000Z	abarbaccia	n8tuser	i can connect to my wireless network, but no internet
2008-12-01T00:52:00.000Z	abarbaccia	n8tuser	not even internal stuff (like accessing the AP config pages)
2008-12-01T00:54:00.000Z	abarbaccia	n8tuser	ignore all the others, they're disabled while i test. only ath0. right now i needed to run a wire to do some debug and get online
2008-12-01T00:55:00.000Z	abarbaccia	n8tuser	don't ignore then, just know that they are usually disconnected and not enabled. i enabled one of them so i can get online right now and debug
2008-12-01T00:56:00.000Z	abarbaccia	n8tuser	i dont understand. this is the same config i've always used. ubuntu updated and i rebooted now it does not work. i plugged in a wire to my AP so i can get online
2008-12-01T00:58:00.000Z	abarbaccia	n8tuser	how is this not accurate - its the exact output of what you told me to run.
2008-12-01T00:58:00.000Z	abarbaccia	n8tuser	if you need more information about my setup i can tell you
2008-12-01T01:00:00.000Z	abarbaccia	n8tuser	there are two wired cards (eth0 and eth1) and one wireless card (ath0). I use the wireless card to connect to the internet and the wired cards are disconnected. Currently, for debug only, I have connected a wire to eth0 so I can get online and hoepfully debug / fix this problem
2008-12-01T01:00:00.000Z	abarbaccia	n8tuser	when i plug in a wire, i do not change any of the settings, it just flips over to using that instead of using the wireless.
2008-12-01T01:02:00.000Z	abarbaccia	n8tuser	usually there are wired cards do not have a wire plugged into them. for debug only i plugged a wire into one of them so i can get online.
2008-12-01T01:03:00.000Z	abarbaccia	n8tuser	i usually do. i usually only use ath0 (wireless). Now wireless stopped working. To answer your question - when i make changes and test (unplug the wire) it would have to take ath0 because there is no connection for eth0 and eth1
2008-12-01T01:04:00.000Z	abarbaccia	n8tuser	ath0 pulls an IP from the AP successfully. When i try to ping or get on the internet it cannot resolve.
2008-12-01T01:05:00.000Z	abarbaccia	n8tuser	i don't know for sure. things got a little confusing since netapplet
2008-12-01T01:05:00.000Z	abarbaccia	n8tuser	suffer... haha - then lets start going with the advice part
