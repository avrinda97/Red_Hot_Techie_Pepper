2009-06-29T06:43:00.000Z	bsmith_		I've follwed directions at HOWTO contro your home PC from your office (terminal, putty, ddclient & sshd) on ubuntu forums.  Can someone help me with firestarter
2009-06-29T06:44:00.000Z	coleys	bsmith_	uhh... Firestarter isn't being developed anymore is it?
2009-06-29T06:44:00.000Z	bsmith_	coleys	I am unaware of that, I just downloaded it recently.
2009-06-29T06:44:00.000Z	coleys	bsmith_	I could be wrong, but you don't really need firestarter. Just complicates things unecessarily.
2009-06-29T06:45:00.000Z	coleys	bsmith_	And... are you having truoble getting ssh to work?
2009-06-29T06:46:00.000Z	bsmith_	coleys	yes
2009-06-29T06:46:00.000Z	coleys	bsmith_	sudo apt-get install openssh-server
2009-06-29T06:46:00.000Z	coleys	bsmith_	ssh -l coleys(Username) 192.168.2.18(local IP)
2009-06-29T06:47:00.000Z	coleys	bsmith_	So in this format: ssh -l username Localip(or internetip)
2009-06-29T06:50:00.000Z	coleys	bsmith_	Do both computers have... openssh-server installed on them?
2009-06-29T06:50:00.000Z	coleys	bsmith_	And are both connected to the internet/lan
2009-06-29T06:52:00.000Z	bsmith_	coleys	no I couldn't even intall openssh-server
2009-06-29T06:53:00.000Z	coleys	bsmith_	sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt-get install openssh-server
2009-06-29T06:53:00.000Z	coleys	bsmith_	sudo apt-get upgrate && sudo apt-get install openssh-server*
2009-06-29T06:53:00.000Z	coleys	bsmith_	sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install openssh-server*
