2006-07-18T14:55:00.000Z	timbobsteve	b14ck	ok... so I take it you get your IP from the modem when you reboot ?
2006-07-18T14:55:00.000Z	b14ck	timbobsteve	so i'm not the only one with the problem?
2006-07-18T14:56:00.000Z	b14ck	timbobsteve	it's a pppoe connection
2006-07-18T14:56:00.000Z	timbobsteve	b14ck	no... i meant "no one HEAR knows how to fix it".... I am sure it is fixable
2006-07-18T14:56:00.000Z	b14ck	timbobsteve	yeah by calling my ISP and i'm kinda tired of that because it keeps happening and they're probably tired of fixing it
2006-07-18T14:57:00.000Z	timbobsteve	b14ck	ok... that doesn't help just saying its pppoe... does your PC recieve its IP address from the modem ?
2006-07-18T14:57:00.000Z	b14ck	timbobsteve	yeah. i only input the user/pass
2006-07-18T14:57:00.000Z	timbobsteve	b14ck	as in... ok... so you used a web-style interface to configure your modem when you first got it ?
2006-07-18T14:58:00.000Z	b14ck	timbobsteve	well not exactly modem. ethernet PCI adapter
2006-07-18T14:58:00.000Z	b14ck	timbobsteve	and i ocnfigured it with sudo pppoeconf
2006-07-18T14:59:00.000Z	timbobsteve	b14ck	ok.... thats beyond me.. I use a standard Ethernet modem.... pppoe is something different alltogether... mainly for cable style setups as far as I know (and i guess adsl)
2006-07-18T14:59:00.000Z	b14ck	timbobsteve	ok thanx. know any other help cnahhel?
2006-07-18T15:01:00.000Z	timbobsteve	b14ck	from now on when asking questions you should talk about pppoe... not just ADSL... it gives ppl more info to help you..
2006-07-18T15:01:00.000Z	timbobsteve	b14ck	I guess any standard linux help channel would be able to help you out
2006-07-18T15:03:00.000Z	b14ck	timbobsteve	ok thanx.
