2009-01-31T07:27:00.000Z	bnovc		why do repositories for older versions of ubuntu just get deleted with no way to update anymore?
2009-01-31T07:28:00.000Z	usser	bnovc	its kind of expensive maintaining repositories, and ubuntu's philosophy is new release every six months, there are long term support releases that are supported for 3 years, hardy is lts
2009-01-31T07:29:00.000Z	bnovc	usser	i should at least be given the option to update to a newer version though....
