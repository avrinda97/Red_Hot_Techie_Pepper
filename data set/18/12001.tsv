2006-06-01T15:46:00.000Z	MehAdult		!tell MehAdult about ndiswrapper
2006-06-01T15:47:00.000Z	MehAdult		Can I install ndiswrapper for 6.0.4 if I just installed 6.0.6?
2006-06-01T15:47:00.000Z	MehAdult		I have a wireless connection that needs it.
2006-06-01T15:48:00.000Z	crimsun	MehAdult	recompile it
2006-06-01T15:48:00.000Z	MehAdult	crimsun	How do I do that?
2006-06-01T15:49:00.000Z	crimsun	MehAdult	the same way you did for the previous version, I presume
2006-06-01T15:49:00.000Z	MehAdult	crimsun	This is a brand new install.
2006-06-01T15:50:00.000Z	crimsun	MehAdult	why not just use the included ndiswrapper?
2006-06-01T15:50:00.000Z	MehAdult	crimsun	But the .debs are for 6.0.4 and I'm wondering if it's safe.
2006-06-01T15:50:00.000Z	MehAdult	crimsun	I'm not sure it's installed.
2006-06-01T15:50:00.000Z	crimsun	MehAdult	yes, it is
2006-06-01T15:50:00.000Z	crimsun	MehAdult	you can find myriad instructions on the wiki/forum/...
