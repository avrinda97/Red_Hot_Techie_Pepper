2008-09-20T07:13:00.000Z	gluonman		Perhaps someone else will know the answer to my question. I was being helped but got left with one remaining quesiton to go. I was given a website with repository sources in it, and I was told to make sources.list point to it. My question is if I should uncomment the existing sources in the sources.list and add the website, or if I should just add the website. Also, is it as simple as just adding the website url, or is there a synt

2008-09-20T07:13:00.000Z	ceil420	gluonman	i know you can just add the website, but i don't know what parameters might be needed. said website should be able to tell you exactly how to add it to sources.list
2008-09-20T07:15:00.000Z	gluonman	ceil420	it's one of those archive sites with a list of directories. No instructional information at all. But I'll just try adding the url to sources.list. And my guess is that I need to uncomment the sources already in there.
2008-09-20T07:15:00.000Z	gluonman	ceil420	I mean comment, not uncomment.
2008-09-20T07:16:00.000Z	ceil420	gluonman	apt-get works by checking all the listed repositories for the package you requested; if the package isn't in ubuntu's standard repositories, it'll just move down the list
2008-09-20T07:16:00.000Z	ceil420	gluonman	don't forget to apt-get update after adding a repo so that apt-get knows to use it
2008-09-20T07:17:00.000Z	gluonman	ceil420	you obviously aren't up-to-date on the issue I was having. I'm trying to get ntfs-3g on my friend's Edgy computer (whose repositories aren't even supported any more) so that I can have read and write access to my NTFS formatted external so transfer all wanted files before I install hardy.
2008-09-20T07:18:00.000Z	gluonman	ceil420	so, because the sources in sources.list don't even work at all (updating or installing is futile), I need to use this website.
2008-09-20T07:18:00.000Z	ceil420	gluonman	if the repos don't even work, i'd assume you can just leave them commented. is there any reason your friend can't upgrade a couple of times?
2008-09-20T07:19:00.000Z	gluonman	ceil420	she once had a friend who replaced her Windows with Ubuntu a long time ago and never taught her anything about updating, etc. So she never did. Now that the rest of us are in Hardy, she's still in Edgy and updates and installations from repos don't work at all.
2008-09-20T07:20:00.000Z	gluonman	ceil420	she doesn't know anything about Ubuntu other than using firefox and openoffice for simple tasks.
2008-09-20T07:20:00.000Z	ceil420	gluonman	maybe you can help her :p
2008-09-20T07:21:00.000Z	gluonman	ceil420	well, I'm going to get her hardy (once I can get over this obstacle), and then actually teach her what she should have been taught before.
2008-09-20T07:21:00.000Z	ceil420	gluonman	good man :)
2008-09-20T07:21:00.000Z	gluonman	ceil420	but we're on wired internet, but only one wire, so I'm going to disconnect my box and connect hers and see if I can install ntfs-3g from sources.list with that website included and everything commented out.
2008-09-20T07:21:00.000Z	gluonman	ceil420	I'll be back if there's still a problem.
2008-09-20T07:22:00.000Z	ceil420	gluonman	good luck
