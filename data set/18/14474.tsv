2006-10-03T05:56:00.000Z	M_A_K		I just downloaded Limewire for linux.  It was an RPM file.  How do I install it under ubuntu?

2006-10-18T06:49:00.000Z	variant	M_A_K	cp -r -P
2006-10-18T06:51:00.000Z	variant	M_A_K	cp -a even
2006-10-18T06:52:00.000Z	variant	M_A_K	the same as if you use -p (preserve) -r (recurse) -d (dereference)
2006-10-18T06:54:00.000Z	variant	M_A_K	providing you have read permission on those files
2006-10-18T06:54:00.000Z	variant	M_A_K	if you dont want them to be owned by root you can change that
2006-10-18T06:55:00.000Z	variant	M_A_K	chown -R user /dir/
2006-10-18T06:57:00.000Z	variant	M_A_K	yes
2006-10-18T06:57:00.000Z	variant	M_A_K	use chgrp as well, otherwise some of the files will be in root's group
2006-10-18T06:58:00.000Z	variant	M_A_K	same command but chgrp instead of chown
2006-10-18T07:00:00.000Z	variant	M_A_K	yes, if your changing permissions of a root owned file (which is what you said you were doing)
2006-10-18T07:29:00.000Z	variant	M_A_K	thats symlinks?
2006-10-18T07:29:00.000Z	variant	M_A_K	symlinks wont be..
2006-10-18T07:30:00.000Z	variant	M_A_K	no, that is a common way to update
2006-10-18T07:31:00.000Z	variant	M_A_K	cp -a -p would be better
2006-10-18T07:31:00.000Z	variant	M_A_K	what was the software?
