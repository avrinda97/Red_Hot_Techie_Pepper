2012-02-01T23:50:00.000Z	fzlamn		how to fix this problem http://pastebin.com/1eVcFEQT
2012-02-01T23:51:00.000Z	MFen	fzlamn	likely an error in the url. are you using an https:// url? if you bring it up in a browser do you get an error?
2012-02-01T23:52:00.000Z	fzlamn	MFen	i'll paste it again
2012-02-01T23:54:00.000Z	fzlamn	MFen	i try to add new ppa to my 11.10 and this problem occur http://pastebin.com/1eVcFEQT
2012-02-01T23:54:00.000Z	MFen	fzlamn	i already responded to that error, see above.
2012-02-01T23:55:00.000Z	fzlamn	MFen	you cannot open the url?
2012-02-01T23:55:00.000Z	MFen	fzlamn	i see your pastebin just fine. it doesn't include the command you're typing, but i assume there is a url of some kind that you are typing. that url is probably wrong, or the server at the other end is wrong
2012-02-01T23:57:00.000Z	fzlamn	MFen	okay... it happen when i try to add any ppa
2012-02-01T23:57:00.000Z	MFen	fzlamn	when you ask a question you should include the command you're typing or the actions you are doing
2012-02-01T23:58:00.000Z	fzlamn	MFen	it happen when i put in this command sudo apt-add-repository ppa:unity-team/ppa
2012-02-01T23:59:00.000Z	MFen	fzlamn	ok. next question: do you have a network proxy of some kind?
2012-02-01T23:59:00.000Z	fzlamn	MFen	no i don't
2012-02-02T00:00:00.000Z	MFen	fzlamn	the error you're getting indicates that apt-add-repository is making a connection to a server which it *thinks* is using https (TLS), but is, in fact, not
2012-02-02T00:02:00.000Z	MFen	fzlamn	aptitude install lynx, then type: lynx https://ppa.launchpad.net/
2012-02-02T00:03:00.000Z	fzlamn	MFen	i have to install lynx?
2012-02-02T00:03:00.000Z	MFen	fzlamn	for diagnostic purposes
2012-02-02T00:05:00.000Z	MFen	fzlamn	xangua: that's interesting. on my system they are symlinked to the same command. i wonder if that's not always the case? apparently on xangua's system they are different somehow
2012-02-02T00:05:00.000Z	MFen	fzlamn	ls -l /usr/bin/apt-add-repository
