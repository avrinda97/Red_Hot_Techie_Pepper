2009-01-24T00:48:00.000Z	Jammet		Is it okay to ask a question about a linux program in a this channel, or does my question absolutely have to be about the distro?
2009-01-24T00:50:00.000Z	Jammet		I have a usability question about a program, may I ask it in here?
2009-01-24T00:50:00.000Z	Slart	Jammet	sure, as long as it is ubuntu-related
2009-01-24T00:51:00.000Z	Jammet	Slart	It's as much Ubuntu related as it is Linux related. It's an app I can run on Ubuntu. If I want to. Is that related enough? =)
2009-01-24T00:51:00.000Z	Slart	Jammet	go ahead
2009-01-24T00:54:00.000Z	Slart	Jammet	hmm.. I've never used DVD95.. selecting a track sounds weird.. you are doing a normal dvd backup/copy ?
2009-01-24T00:55:00.000Z	Jammet	Slart	Yeah. It's a movie DVD. DVD95s purpose is to backup the entire disc. That's what I want to do. But it presents me with a choice instead of just copying the whole disk, it wants to know what portion of the disk I want copied, but doesn't allow me to say "All of it".
2009-01-24T00:57:00.000Z	Slart	Jammet	have you tried any of the other DVD-backup apps? k9 is one.. there might be more
2009-01-24T00:59:00.000Z	Jammet	Slart	Thanks a good offer, though I am trying to keep KDE off the system for now. It might actually do what I want, but "DVD9to5" says it does the same thing. Just have to find someone who knows how.
2009-01-24T00:59:00.000Z	Slart	Jammet	hang on.. let me try it.. see if it does the same for me
2009-01-24T01:01:00.000Z	Jammet	Slart	Thanks for your help =). Insert a movie DVD, any will do. I am trying to backup a TV series, meaning there are 5 tracks, each 23 minutes long. Now, it will rip 1 track just fine, but that's it. I get an ISO file with that one video plus DVD menus.
2009-01-24T01:02:00.000Z	Slart	Jammet	ok.. I don't think I have any dvd's with several tracks.. I guess star wars will have to do =).. I'll brb with a report
2009-01-24T01:02:00.000Z	Jammet	Slart	Okay :)
2009-01-24T01:13:00.000Z	Slart	Jammet	hmm.. dvd95 is most annoying.. I too can only select one track out of 15..and no amount of bad words and manual reading seems to help..
2009-01-24T02:20:00.000Z	Jammet	Slart	My apologies for disappearing earlier.
2009-01-24T02:21:00.000Z	Jammet	Slart	I have friends visiting and I cannot stay on, just wanted to give you my thanks for helping =).
2009-01-24T02:21:00.000Z	Slart	Jammet	you're welcome.. hope you find a better program to copy dvd's =)
2009-01-24T02:23:00.000Z	Jammet	Slart	For now I've settled with just copying the actual files from the DVDs to the harddrive. That kinda works, too.
