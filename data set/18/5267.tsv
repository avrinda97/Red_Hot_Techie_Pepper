2009-07-18T10:41:00.000Z	Ziber		Why, if i sudo apt-get install traceroute, does it still say command not found?
2009-07-18T10:42:00.000Z	jander99	Ziber	"locate traceroute" and see what it says.
2009-07-18T10:43:00.000Z	jander99	Ziber	Should give some /etc/alternatives, /usr/bin, /usr/share/man, /var/lib/dpkg
2009-07-18T10:44:00.000Z	Ziber		Well, now I get a weird error.
2009-07-18T10:44:00.000Z	Ziber		[ziber@alpha ~]$ traceroute omega.ziber.org
2009-07-18T10:44:00.000Z	Ziber		traceroute: icmp socket: Operation not permitted
2009-07-18T10:45:00.000Z	jander99	Ziber	Can you run sudo traceroute ?
2009-07-18T10:45:00.000Z	Ziber		I can run it as sudo.
2009-07-18T10:45:00.000Z	Ziber		:/ Why not as normal user?
2009-07-18T10:47:00.000Z	jander99	Ziber	Have a firewall?
2009-07-18T10:47:00.000Z	Ziber		Nope.
2009-07-18T10:47:00.000Z	jander99	Ziber	Can you also ping
2009-07-18T10:48:00.000Z	Ziber		I can ping as non-root, just not traceroute.
2009-07-18T10:49:00.000Z	jander99	Ziber	Can you "ls -l /etc/alternatives/traceroute" and tell me the ownership of the file?
2009-07-18T10:49:00.000Z	Ziber	jander99	lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 33 2009-07-18 01:43 /etc/alternatives/traceroute -> /usr/bin/traceroute-nanog.genuine
2009-07-18T10:50:00.000Z	jander99	Ziber	I would assume you apt-get install traceroute-nanog instead of traceroute?
2009-07-18T10:51:00.000Z	Ziber		Hmm. I removed that and it works, thanks.
2009-07-18T10:51:00.000Z	jander99	Ziber	No problem.  I actually don't know what the -nanog variant does :P
