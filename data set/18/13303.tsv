2006-03-29T14:45:00.000Z	dli	Badm4n	xset -display :0 s off
2006-03-29T14:46:00.000Z	dli	Badm4n	do you have apt-file? "apt-file update;apt-file search xset

2006-03-29T14:52:00.000Z	Badm4n	dli	: i want to run cmatrix ( screensaver ) when i'm idle in 10second .. ( FYI : i want it to run at my putty.exe
2006-03-29T14:53:00.000Z	Badm4n	dli	: in other word ... how to make screen saver ( run cmatrix ) when i'm idle on my remote console
2006-03-29T14:54:00.000Z	dli	Badm4n	run any screensaver with some options
2006-03-29T14:54:00.000Z	Badm4n	dli	try to apt-cache search cmatrix
2006-03-29T14:56:00.000Z	dli	Badm4n	however, running screensaver across net is a bad idea, huge traffic load for your net
2006-03-29T14:57:00.000Z	Badm4n	dli	: this only for local server ... gateway server only
2006-03-29T14:58:00.000Z	dli	Badm4n	pointless to add the traffic load, running a windows screensaver sounds better
2006-03-29T14:59:00.000Z	Badm4n	dli	: i want to create like "autolog - Terminates connections for idle users "but i want to run screensaver not kick
2006-03-29T15:01:00.000Z	Badm4n	dli	: i want to create like "autolog - Terminates connections for idle users "but i want to run screensaver not kick
2006-03-29T15:01:00.000Z	dli	Badm4n	you can make sshd keep connections (idle time?)
2006-03-29T15:02:00.000Z	Badm4n	dli	: what is the command/config ?
2006-03-29T15:02:00.000Z	dli	Badm4n	in /etc/ssh/sshd_config, mand sshd_config
