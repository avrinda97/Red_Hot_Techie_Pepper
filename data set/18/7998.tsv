2007-10-15T06:15:00.000Z	lloeki	rpj8	then just create a user for testing, so as not to break your regular account
2007-10-15T06:16:00.000Z	rpj8	lloeki	Oh good point. Would setting up a different user make it so that different user would have a totally different environment?
2007-10-15T06:16:00.000Z	lloeki	rpj8	that's the point :)
2007-10-15T06:17:00.000Z	lloeki	rpj8	all non system settings being stored per user in dotted dirs, as long as you don't mess with system files, you're safe :)
2007-10-15T06:17:00.000Z	lloeki	rpj8	with this one user can easily run kde and the other one gnome
2007-10-15T06:18:00.000Z	rpj8	lloeki	I see. so as long as I don't mess with /etc, /var... as long as I stick with messing with stuff in ~ I should be alright?
2007-10-15T06:18:00.000Z	rpj8	lloeki	Very helpful tip.Looks like I'll break open another user account
2007-10-15T06:19:00.000Z	lloeki	rpj8	you can even set up some session handling via .xininitrc or /etc/X11/Sessions, so that one can select the DM started on login
2007-10-15T06:20:00.000Z	rpj8	lloeki	.xininitrc?
2007-10-15T06:21:00.000Z	lloeki	rpj8	.xinitrc is the file called on when you run startx from a VT, or it can be started by gdm/kdm/xdm
2007-10-15T06:22:00.000Z	rpj8	lloeki	I see. slocate shows that's in etc/X11/xinit right?
2007-10-15T06:22:00.000Z	lloeki	rpj8	that's the default one, when~/.xinitrc is not present
2007-10-15T06:23:00.000Z	rpj8	lloeki	If I were to touch .xinitrc and leave it blank, would that cause gdm to just go "wtf" and not load up my desktop manager?
2007-10-15T06:24:00.000Z	lloeki	rpj8	totally. gdm would execute nothing but oblivin, and then return back to gdm
2007-10-15T06:24:00.000Z	rpj8	lloeki	Alright. I won't touch that then until I read up some docs about it lol
2007-10-15T06:26:00.000Z	lloeki	rpj8	good attitude :) , you will mainly want to understand the 'exec' keyword inside this file.
2007-10-15T06:27:00.000Z	lloeki	rpj8	now I'll wish you good luck in your tweaking ventures ;)
2007-10-15T06:27:00.000Z	rpj8	lloeki	Thanks very much :) Your information will be very helpful
