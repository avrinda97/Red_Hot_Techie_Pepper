2010-07-14T21:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Guest47056	 go to the conky homepage. and learn how its configured.
2010-07-14T21:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Guest47056	 it dosent really use 'themes' you just make a config file for it that looks/works how you want.
2010-07-14T21:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Guest47056	 there was some Gui Config for conky i saw (in testing) but never got it to work. and i dont rember its name
2010-07-14T21:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Guest47056	 then you need to look harder. the conky homepage has docs on how to configure conky and links to dozens of configs
2010-07-14T21:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Guest47056	 and theres dozens and dozens of other places that have example conky configs
2010-07-14T21:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Guest47056	 some of mine -> http://drop.io/dr_willis
2010-07-14T21:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Guest47056	 conky uses the .conkyrc to define its look.
2010-07-14T21:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Guest47056	 nice conky setup --> http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Conky+Ubuntu+Lucid+Theme+-+English?content=124209
2010-07-14T22:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Guest47056	 ~/.conkyrc is the path.. there is no .scripts directory. You can run conky to load any config from any location via the proper command line options.
2010-07-14T22:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Guest47056	 start reading at -> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conky_%28software%29
2010-07-14T22:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Guest47056	 conky -c pickaconfig.file.to.use    --> .conkyrc is used if you dont tell it another name
2010-07-14T22:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Guest47056	 its a text file.. use any text editor.
2010-07-14T22:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	Guest47056	 read up on conky. It does take some efffort to learn to use it properly ---> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conky_%28software%29
