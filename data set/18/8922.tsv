2007-06-06T16:24:00.000Z	Tom47	todders	i installed it on a p111 886 mhz today
2007-06-06T16:25:00.000Z	Tom47	todders	but it was reasonably slow to install and while it only had 128mb ram it used a pre-existing swap file to get through  its labours
2007-06-06T16:31:00.000Z	Tom47	todders	is he saying its installing now?
