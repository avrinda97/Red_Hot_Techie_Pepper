2006-06-27T13:39:00.000Z	Sivik		what is /dev/wacom?
2006-06-27T13:40:00.000Z	Ng	Sivik	device node for a wacom tablet
2006-06-27T13:40:00.000Z	Sivik	Ng	ok, how do i turn it off, it won't allow me to start the xserver because of it
2006-06-27T13:41:00.000Z	Ng	Sivik	are you getting an error?
2006-06-27T13:41:00.000Z	Sivik	Ng	yes
2006-06-27T13:41:00.000Z	Sivik	Ng	Error opening /dev/wacom : No such file or directory
2006-06-27T13:42:00.000Z	Ng	Sivik	I expect you could remove the wacom entries from the xorg.conf
2006-06-27T13:46:00.000Z	Sivik	Ng	now its telling me no screens found
2006-06-27T13:46:00.000Z	Ng	Sivik	could you post your xorg.conf to a pastebin?
2006-06-27T13:47:00.000Z	Sivik	Ng	it says Fetal server error: no screens found
2006-06-27T13:47:00.000Z	Ng	Sivik	towards the end of /var/log/Xorg.0.log there will be a more useful error
2006-06-27T13:47:00.000Z	Sivik	Ng	a XIO error or an xauth error?
2006-06-27T13:49:00.000Z	Sivik	Ng	XIO: fattal IO error 104 (connection reset by peer) on X server ":0.0" after 0 requests (0 known processed) with 0 events remaining
2006-06-27T13:49:00.000Z	Ng	Sivik	I'm not sure exactly without seeing it. If you want to get the config back to how it was you can do "sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg"
2006-06-27T13:49:00.000Z	Ng	Sivik	possibly a bit further before that
2006-06-27T13:49:00.000Z	Sivik	Ng	xauth: error in locking authority file /home/name/.Xauthority
2006-06-27T13:49:00.000Z	Sivik	Ng	thats the only error
2006-06-27T13:50:00.000Z	Ng	Sivik	hmm, perhaps try deleting that file and doing the dpkg-reconfigure - the error may not have been wacom after all
