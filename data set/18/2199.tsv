2010-07-27T06:18:00.000Z	uLinux		I'm having a issue with localhost... If I scan for open ports on localhost using network tools it doesnt show anything but if I use 127.0.0.1 it works.
2010-07-27T06:20:00.000Z	ilovefairuz	uLinux	type: host localhost
2010-07-27T06:20:00.000Z	uLinux	ilovefairuz	localhost has address 127.0.0.1
