2005-08-11T09:37:00.000Z	rob_p	brokenbox	 I've got 2 Realtek 8139s in my Ubuntu box.  They seem to work just fine.  I didn't have to do anything special to get them to come up...
2005-08-11T09:38:00.000Z	brokenbox	rob_p	what kernel modules are your realteks using
2005-08-11T09:38:00.000Z	rob_p	brokenbox	 They are listed as: Ethernet controller: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd. RTL-8139/8139C/8139C+ (rev 10)
2005-08-11T09:39:00.000Z	rob_p	brokenbox	 I believe 8139too, yes.
2005-08-11T09:40:00.000Z	brokenbox	rob_p	hmmm yeah thats what it should be... weirdness.  I reckon ill try a network restart and see what goes
2005-08-11T09:40:00.000Z	rob_p	brokenbox	 What version of 8139 are you running?
2005-08-11T09:42:00.000Z	rob_p	brokenbox	 do a, "lspci | grep 8139" for more info...
2005-08-11T09:43:00.000Z	rob_p	brokenbox	 Anyway, good luck with it.  I hope you figure it out.
