2011-06-21T13:43:00.000Z	wols	Starminn	apt-cache policy banshee-extensions-common       it looks like that banshee ppa is not working properly
2011-06-21T13:45:00.000Z	Starminn	wols	Refresh 2100405 (the last link)
2011-06-21T13:48:00.000Z	wols	Starminn	I'm a moron :(   your initial synaptic paste showed why it didn't want to install. try to install it using aptitude, it should give you an explanation how that lyrics package prevents the install. sorry
2011-06-21T13:49:00.000Z	Starminn	wols	:) That's okay. Thank you for your time and thoughts, though. :)
2011-06-21T13:50:00.000Z	wols	Starminn	aptitude install <banshee thing> should tell you why it doesn't want to install. usually you have to remove the lyrics package first, then you can
2011-06-21T13:52:00.000Z	Starminn	wols	Lyrics is not installed. Aptitude: http://pastie.org/2100405
2011-06-21T13:54:00.000Z	wols	Starminn	after "The following packages have unmet dependencies:" you see exactly why it can't be installed. if you need those packages, you have to decide
2011-06-21T13:54:00.000Z	wols	Starminn	I suggest you uninstall all of banshee and reinstall it. just don't purge anything so you don't lose any data
2011-06-21T13:56:00.000Z	wols	Starminn	those 3 packages there prevent the new banshee from installing basically
2011-06-21T13:59:00.000Z	Starminn	wols	So removing via Software Center would be adequate enough?
2011-06-21T13:59:00.000Z	wols	Starminn	sure
2011-06-21T14:06:00.000Z	Starminn	wols	Didn't help (remove, install)
2011-06-21T14:07:00.000Z	wols	Starminn	the aptitude output tells you which version exactly it needs. check if that version is available anywhere
