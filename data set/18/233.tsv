2012-06-03T15:15:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	damms005	 clarify what info you need perhaps
2012-06-03T15:16:00.000Z	damms005	Dr_Willis	I want a lead to read about HOW TO CONFIGURE COMPUTERS TO INTERACT(like networking). e.g. install apache on pc1 and access it from pc2
2012-06-03T15:18:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	damms005	you just sort of asked how to 'physically' network pcs. but thenyou asked how to setup specific services.. so you do know how to plug in the cables/routers and stuff?
2012-06-03T15:21:00.000Z	damms005	Dr_Willis	no doc. I can do with connecting them. Accessing them is my itch
2012-06-03T15:22:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	damms005	 if they can ping each other they are networked. what service are you wanting to use is the next question
2012-06-03T15:23:00.000Z	damms005	Dr_Willis	access web service on pc1 from pc2. (like localhost)
2012-06-03T15:24:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	damms005	 localhost is the local box. http://localhost shows the local apache web site here..
2012-06-03T15:30:00.000Z	damms005	Dr_Willis	so can  access pc1 from pc2 after connecting them via anymeans possible?(wired,wireless,etc...)
2012-06-03T15:36:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	damms005	 wikipedia may be worth  reading up some of thrse terms on
2012-06-03T15:37:00.000Z	damms005	Dr_Willis	So I get it, but how does it apply to eth0? (will not always have to go wiki if i have people like you...)
2012-06-03T15:39:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	damms005	 you should go read some networking fundamental guides.
2012-06-03T15:40:00.000Z	damms005	Dr_Willis	Any suggested guide?
2012-06-09T23:51:00.000Z	damms005	Dr_Willis	I use find ./ -size -10k -exec ls -lh '{}' \; to get the output before rm them but I see files even of 153K listed by ls
2012-06-09T23:52:00.000Z	damms005	Dr_Willis	I use find ./ -size -10 -exec ls -lh '{}' \; to get the output before rm them but I see files even of 153K listed by ls
2012-06-09T23:53:00.000Z	damms005	Dr_Willis	I use find ./ -size -10 -exec ls -lh '{}' \; to get the output before rm them but I see files even of 153K listed by ls...I thought the -10 arguement for -size should match files less than 5kb
2012-06-09T23:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	damms005	 this seems to work for me -->  find ./ -size -4k -exec ls -lh '{}' \;
2012-06-09T23:55:00.000Z	damms005	Dr_Willis	Does that match files less than 2kb or 4kb? Someone said I will use a "c " for -size. I am confused and none of these seem to work for me
2012-06-09T23:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	damms005	 no idea. its just showing a bunch of tiny files. I dont see any more then 4k
