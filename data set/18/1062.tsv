2011-06-15T05:13:00.000Z	rubenjr7777	quant	can i instal games from the web on this?
2011-06-15T05:13:00.000Z	quant	rubenjr7777	what do you mean by "games from the web"?
2011-06-15T05:13:00.000Z	rubenjr7777	quant	like .exe extension games
2011-06-15T05:13:00.000Z	quant	rubenjr7777	.exe files are mostly windows file that you cannot run under ubuntu
2011-06-15T05:14:00.000Z	quant	rubenjr7777	ubuntu software center -> games
2011-06-15T05:14:00.000Z	rubenjr7777	quant	they arent that good though. like are there any extreme 3d games
2011-06-15T05:15:00.000Z	quant	rubenjr7777	there are no games like that (almost) for GNU/Linux (Ubuntu or any other)
2011-06-15T05:15:00.000Z	quant	rubenjr7777	but, you may be able to run some through wine
