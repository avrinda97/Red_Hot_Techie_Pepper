2007-08-22T05:19:00.000Z	Thunderfox933		how can i back up my /home and change the fs
2007-08-22T05:20:00.000Z	Thunderfox933		can i back up the files to the /root folder than use gparted to create a new FS
2007-08-22T05:21:00.000Z	Thunderfox933		ext3 is so slow
2007-08-22T05:21:00.000Z	Thunderfox933		does reiserfs have to fsck itself every certain amount of mounts
2007-08-22T05:23:00.000Z	Thunderfox933		does anyone use JFS?
2007-08-22T05:23:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Thunderfox933	Ext is pretty solid and journaled, I would check for hardware failure if it is getting corrupted once a week
2007-08-22T05:25:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Thunderfox933	Possibly, the default is what it is for a reason
2007-08-22T05:25:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Thunderfox933	Still, I wouldn't expect corruption once a week even with ext3
2007-08-22T05:25:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Thunderfox933	*ext2
2007-08-22T05:26:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Thunderfox933	And ext2 isn't journaled at all
2007-08-22T05:26:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Thunderfox933	I think that is an option of the OS, not the File system
2007-08-22T05:29:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Thunderfox933	What makes you think that the File System was corrupted?
2007-08-22T05:33:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Thunderfox933	Because all FS's do.
2007-08-22T05:41:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Thunderfox933	that can be turned off
2007-08-22T05:45:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Thunderfox933	http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=300477 like it says though, you shouldn't turn it off completely
2007-08-22T05:46:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Thunderfox933	Because if your drive goes bad you can have corruption without even having a write to disk
2007-09-04T11:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Thunderfox933	Define safe?
2007-09-04T11:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Thunderfox933	It probably won't start writing zeros to the drive but you never know
