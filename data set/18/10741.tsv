2007-01-29T08:16:00.000Z	alanhaggai		Which FTP Daemon would you recommend?
2007-01-29T08:16:00.000Z	psh	alanhaggai	vsftpd
2007-01-29T08:16:00.000Z	alanhaggai	psh	I am using vsftpd, but having trouble now.
2007-01-29T08:17:00.000Z	psh	alanhaggai	but dont use ftp :)
2007-01-29T08:17:00.000Z	psh	alanhaggai	it is UNSECURE
2007-01-29T08:17:00.000Z	alanhaggai	psh	Oh I see. So, how cn I allow users to host files without FTP?
2007-01-29T08:18:00.000Z	psh	alanhaggai	there is a scponly app i think its called, then you should chroot users somewhere... ok ftp is simpler maybe but..
2007-01-29T08:18:00.000Z	alanhaggai	psh	Thank you :)
2007-01-29T08:19:00.000Z	psh	alanhaggai	there are vsftpd proftpd and wu-ftp that are the big ftpds
2007-01-29T08:19:00.000Z	alanhaggai	psh	Ok. I will try them.
2007-01-29T08:20:00.000Z	psh	alanhaggai	i personally like vsftpd best, ist simple and hm...secure(?)
2007-01-29T08:20:00.000Z	alanhaggai	psh	It is simple. But now, it says connection refused. :(
2007-01-29T08:21:00.000Z	psh	alanhaggai	maybe youre logged in once already... well read the conf file, it is very informative
2007-01-29T08:22:00.000Z	alanhaggai	psh	I did install wzdftpd. I think that might have played with vsftpd which was working fine till then. So, how can I remove wzdftpd?
2007-01-29T08:22:00.000Z	psh	alanhaggai	apt-get remove --purge *package*
2007-01-29T08:23:00.000Z	alanhaggai	psh	It says not installed. But I am sure that it is installed.
2007-01-29T08:23:00.000Z	psh	alanhaggai	install it, then uninstall it,
2007-01-29T08:24:00.000Z	alanhaggai	psh	Ok.
