2012-04-13T15:18:00.000Z	Marzata		10.04 to 12.04, the desktop will be the same or no?
2012-04-13T15:18:00.000Z	auronandace	Marzata	gnome2 will be dropped, plain and simple
2012-04-13T15:19:00.000Z	auronandace	Marzata	gnome2 is no longer supported by the gnome devs
2012-04-13T15:20:00.000Z	auronandace	Marzata	2 years is a long time in software
2012-04-13T15:20:00.000Z	Marzata	auronandace	it depends how old you are, son
2012-04-13T15:23:00.000Z	auronandace	Marzata	starting with 12.04 the lts releases get 5 years support, that is rather reasonable
2012-04-13T15:24:00.000Z	auronandace	Marzata	another year to go for 10.04 desktop support to end, so you still have time to transitiom
2012-04-27T12:21:00.000Z	Marzata	auronandace	thanks, but the partners are already added
2012-04-27T12:21:00.000Z	Marzata	auronandace	and still no skype in the software senter
2012-04-27T12:22:00.000Z	auronandace	Marzata	odd, sorry i can't help, i don't use skype
2012-08-23T18:42:00.000Z	auronandace	Marzata	xfce and lxde wouldn't be maintained as long as the default ubuntu packages
2012-08-23T18:43:00.000Z	Marzata	auronandace	how come?
2012-08-23T18:43:00.000Z	auronandace	Marzata	manpower
2012-08-23T18:44:00.000Z	Marzata	auronandace	what pkgs will be supported for 5 yrs then?
2012-08-23T18:44:00.000Z	auronandace	Marzata	whatever ships default with ubuntu
2012-08-23T18:44:00.000Z	Marzata	auronandace	only those?
2012-08-23T18:45:00.000Z	auronandace	Marzata	i'd expect others too but not sure what they would be
2012-08-23T18:45:00.000Z	auronandace	Marzata	certainly not whole desktop environments though
