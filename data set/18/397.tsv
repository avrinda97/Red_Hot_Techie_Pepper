2012-03-15T03:34:00.000Z	tanath		why is it impossible to completely get rid of unity and bluetooth?
2012-03-15T03:35:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	tanath	It is not really advised to remove unity, it is rather small anyway.
2012-03-15T03:36:00.000Z	tanath	Fyodorovna	why?
2012-03-15T03:36:00.000Z	tanath	Fyodorovna	i don't want it and have no intention of ever using it. i want it gone. i also don't have bluetooth and want to get rid of that too, but removing one requires installation of the other
2012-03-15T03:36:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	tanath	kind of intertwined with compiz as a plugin and part of gnome 3
2012-03-15T03:37:00.000Z	tanath	Fyodorovna	not going to enable unity plugin in compiz
2012-03-15T03:38:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	tanath	what desktop are you using?
2012-03-15T03:38:00.000Z	tanath	Fyodorovna	xfce
2012-03-15T03:38:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	tanath	cool good desktop.
2012-03-15T03:38:00.000Z	tanath	Fyodorovna	and gnome as backup if needed...
2012-03-15T03:39:00.000Z	tanath	Fyodorovna	so call me ocd if you want, but i don't see a good reason why removal of unity/bluetooth would require installation of the other. that should be fixed
2012-03-15T03:40:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	tanath	not sure myself, make a clone of the OS is probably best really.
2012-03-15T03:41:00.000Z	tanath	Fyodorovna	so compiz has a unity plugin... doesn't mean it's being used. and if there's no unity, the plugin should simply be unusable
2012-03-15T03:41:00.000Z	tanath	Fyodorovna	seriously? you think making and maintaining my own distro is the best solution, rather than fixing an otherwise decent existing distro?
2012-03-15T03:41:00.000Z	tanath	Fyodorovna	i don't have time for that...
2012-03-15T03:43:00.000Z	Fyodorovna	tanath	I never told you to use the unity plugin. Do what you want I can't help.
2012-03-15T03:43:00.000Z	tanath	Fyodorovna	ubuntu is becoming more and more difficult to customize. it's sad
2012-03-15T03:43:00.000Z	tanath	Fyodorovna	huh? i never implied you did...
