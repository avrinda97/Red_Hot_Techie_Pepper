2007-11-18T11:16:00.000Z	SuperQ	yesha	X uses a crypto token system to allow access to the server sessions
2007-11-18T11:17:00.000Z	SuperQ	yesha	If you're familiar with the old xhost command, it's a more secure version of that
2007-11-18T11:17:00.000Z	yesha	SuperQ	not fam
2007-11-18T11:17:00.000Z	SuperQ	yesha	for some reason, Xvnc isn't able to grab a lock on that file.. not sure why tho
2007-11-18T11:18:00.000Z	SuperQ	yesha	Dunno if I can help you right now.
