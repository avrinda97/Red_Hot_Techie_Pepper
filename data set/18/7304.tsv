2009-10-08T11:46:00.000Z	thomas_		HELP!  something very weird just happened to my filesystem ... my 500 GB drive suddenly became full and no matter what I delete it stills shows 0 bytes available. cannot even get my email  ...  anyone have an idea what I can do?
2009-10-08T11:47:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	thomas_	boot to live CD if the drive is your linux drive and fsck it
2009-10-08T11:47:00.000Z	thomas_		action:  have done an fsck on HD ... no luck
2009-10-08T11:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	thomas_	what options did you use?
2009-10-08T11:48:00.000Z	thomas_		just fsck
2009-10-08T11:48:00.000Z	thomas_		from recovery menu
2009-10-08T11:48:00.000Z	thomas_		yes
2009-10-08T11:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	thomas_	not really great, try some extra options
2009-10-08T11:49:00.000Z	thomas_	mneptok	from terminal or reboot?
2009-10-08T11:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	thomas_	did yo uby any chance stop a backup halfway?
2009-10-08T11:50:00.000Z	thomas_	mneptok	thnks will try ...
2009-10-08T11:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	thomas_	like I said, poor fsck options, hence liveCD so the drive isnt mounted (you may have to manipulate swap so its not in use)
2009-10-08T11:53:00.000Z	thomas_		actionparsnip: was not doing a backup, but had installed some software that crashed
2009-10-08T11:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	thomas_	ok try: sudo apt-get clean
2009-10-08T11:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	thomas_	sudo apt-get -f install
2009-10-08T11:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip		!karmic | Guest63473
2009-10-08T11:55:00.000Z	thomas_		actionparsnip: what does that do?
2009-10-08T11:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	thomas_	cleans out the old deb files from cache that you ave installed with and no longer need, then makes sure all apps are satisfied for deps
