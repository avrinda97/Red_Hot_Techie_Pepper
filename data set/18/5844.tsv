2008-11-27T06:35:00.000Z	dr_willis		 leoechevarria  my lernel on the thumbdrive is in /casper/vmlinuz and i must have 2 dozen+ files on the thumbdrive
2008-11-27T06:36:00.000Z	leoechevarria	dr_willis	i'm sorry but i don't find the relation between what you've just said and my problem
2008-11-27T06:37:00.000Z	leoechevarria	dr_willis	it's not that I can't find the kernel image, that's the error message i get when i try to boot with my usb stick
2008-11-27T06:38:00.000Z	dr_willis	leoechevarria	 :) now  thats a bit more clear...   Ive had issues with some thumbdrives and some machines in the past.. due to how they handle the booting from thumbdrives.. got a few thumbdrives taht i jsut cant make bootable. :(
2008-11-27T06:38:00.000Z	leoechevarria	dr_willis	i think it's not the first pendrive i try with, and i've also tried with parted magic
2008-11-27T06:39:00.000Z	dr_willis	leoechevarria	 yep.. it can be rather.. 'random' as to what pcs work and what ones dont.
2008-11-27T06:40:00.000Z	leoechevarria	dr_willis	i mean it's not free... free as in free speech, not free as in free beer
2008-11-27T06:40:00.000Z	leoechevarria	dr_willis	how long is your syslinux.cfg in your usb?
2008-11-27T06:40:00.000Z	dr_willis	leoechevarria	 but you were not clear. :)
2008-11-27T06:40:00.000Z	dr_willis	leoechevarria	 on windows.. so its ONE long line in notepad.exe.. i notice its including a lot of other files.. the whole boot menu layout is a bit overly complex..
2008-11-27T06:40:00.000Z	leoechevarria	dr_willis	i'm argentinian, where free for 'free as in free speech' and free for 'free as in free beer' are different words
2008-11-27T06:42:00.000Z	leoechevarria	dr_willis	not exactly, gratis is Free of cost
2008-11-27T06:43:00.000Z	dr_willis	leoechevarria	 then the term for a tip being a gratuity makes no sence.. :) but its all from latin i imagine and subjet to years of language creep.
2008-11-27T06:43:00.000Z	leoechevarria	dr_willis	i've done the usb stick booteable again but this time from debian with unetbootin, and system.cfg seems to have the necessary information now :)
2008-11-27T06:44:00.000Z	dr_willis	leoechevarria	 ive had some sticks.. once i GET them bootable.. the the other os's where able to install to them and be bootable afterwards.. not sure why that was.
2008-11-27T06:55:00.000Z	dr_willis	leoechevarria	 unetbooting setup is NOT persistant.
2008-11-27T06:55:00.000Z	dr_willis	leoechevarria	 the Ubuntu Tool. does make a peristant setup
2008-11-27T06:56:00.000Z	leoechevarria	dr_willis	so if you need it to be persistant... you got to do it by hand
