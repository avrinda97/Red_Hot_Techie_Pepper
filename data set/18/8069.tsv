2008-09-05T01:07:00.000Z	unop	Fused	you need to change your session at the login window
2008-09-05T01:08:00.000Z	Fused	unop	I know that. However, KDE is showing up in the sessions list, and we are trying to get it out. Kubuntu-desktop has been removed from my system, but continues to show up in the sessions list.
2008-09-05T01:09:00.000Z	unop	Fused	kubuntu-desktop is just a metapackage - removing it has little effect.  fluxbox by default does not launch any session managers, are you starting something with fluxbox?
2008-09-05T01:10:00.000Z	unop	Fused	as i said, removing kubuntu-desktop does not remove any kde packages
2008-09-05T01:10:00.000Z	unop	Fused	to remove all of KDE -- see !puregnome for instructions
2008-09-05T01:11:00.000Z	unop	Fused	that's right .. removing a metapackage does not actually remove much
2008-09-05T01:12:00.000Z	unop	Fused	all will become apparent once you read !puregnome
2008-09-05T01:18:00.000Z	Fused	unop	I received an error at the end of the uninstall.
2008-09-05T01:39:00.000Z	unop	Fused	do you have a file at /var/lib/dpkg/info/kio-umountwrapper.postrm  ?
2008-09-05T01:42:00.000Z	unop	Fused	do you have a file at /var/lib/dpkg/info/kio-umountwrapper.postrm  ?
2008-09-05T01:43:00.000Z	unop	Fused	ok, let's have a look at it
2008-09-05T01:45:00.000Z	Fused	unop	Is that what you meant by a look at it? (http://gpaste.com/p/9fe2d)
2008-09-05T01:47:00.000Z	unop	Fused	yes, indeed..  comment out the first line (prefixing #) .. save the file and attempt to purge that package
2008-09-05T01:48:00.000Z	unop	Fused	yes
2008-09-05T01:49:00.000Z	unop	Fused	sudo aptitude install  #should do
2008-09-05T01:50:00.000Z	unop	Fused	yes, just  sudo aptitude install
2008-09-05T01:51:00.000Z	unop	Fused	well, if all went well, the package should be purged now
2008-09-05T01:51:00.000Z	unop	Fused	:)
