2010-03-01T11:20:00.000Z	mattgyver	rastasean	it almost sounds as if its running as root and your trying to restart it as a normal user
2010-03-01T11:29:00.000Z	mattgyver	rastasean	im not too sure, did you install it from apt?
2010-03-01T11:30:00.000Z	mattgyver	rastasean	yea i never had that problem before with it.  I did some searching but im not finding anything like your problem, just config problems
2010-03-01T11:33:00.000Z	mattgyver	rastasean	what was wrong?
2010-03-01T11:34:00.000Z	mattgyver	rastasean	ahh, so its working now
2010-03-01T11:55:00.000Z	mattgyver	rastasean	you could just use VNC
2010-03-01T11:55:00.000Z	mattgyver	rastasean	whats happening?  (it can be a pain in the butt the first few times to setup)
2010-03-01T11:57:00.000Z	mattgyver	rastasean	the best client in my opinion is remmia but you need to make sure the machine you want to connect to is running a configured VNC server
2010-03-01T11:57:00.000Z	mattgyver	rastasean	UltraVNC is a great one for windows, pretty easy to setup
2010-03-01T11:58:00.000Z	mattgyver	rastasean	you install UltraVNC as a system service (best way), setup port forwards in your router, and then connect from tsclient or whatever VNC client you wish
2010-03-01T11:59:00.000Z	mattgyver	rastasean	generally the port forwarding is the hardest part :X
2010-03-01T12:13:00.000Z	mattgyver	rastasean	i just thought about something.  yeah just use RDP to connect to windows it will be wayyyy faster than VNC
2010-03-01T12:14:00.000Z	mattgyver	rastasean	what version of windows is it?
2010-03-01T12:14:00.000Z	mattgyver	rastasean	its not enabled by design.. ahem.. it can be done though.
2010-03-01T12:16:00.000Z	mattgyver	rastasean	fireup tsclient and then use the RDP protocol to connect, might require a forward in your router to point to that machine, i think its 3389
2010-03-01T12:18:00.000Z	mattgyver	rastasean	yea
