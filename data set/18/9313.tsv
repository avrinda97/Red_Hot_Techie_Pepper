2007-09-30T08:06:00.000Z	marcel		My question is what service would you recommend:
2007-09-30T08:07:00.000Z	marcel		1) DOWN 6 UP 750KBPS
2007-09-30T08:07:00.000Z	marcel		2) DOWN 8 UP 1 MBPS
2007-09-30T08:07:00.000Z	usser	marcel	service of what?
2007-09-30T08:07:00.000Z	usser	marcel	what do u intend to do, run a server or just for a home use?
2007-09-30T08:09:00.000Z	usser	marcel	well the bigger the upstream the better
2007-09-30T08:09:00.000Z	usser	marcel	so go with 2
2007-09-30T08:09:00.000Z	usser	marcel	also ask the ISP if they block 80 port
2007-09-30T08:09:00.000Z	usser	marcel	nope never heard of it
2007-09-30T08:11:00.000Z	usser	marcel	thats impossible
2007-09-30T08:14:00.000Z	usser	marcel	its impossible unless of course they use voodoo and some elaborate compressing algorithm and somehow change the upchannel throughoutput on the fly
2007-10-23T08:48:00.000Z	usser	marcel	depends on the name of your flash drive
2007-10-23T08:49:00.000Z	usser	marcel	usually flash are mounted as /media/disk
2007-10-23T08:49:00.000Z	usser	marcel	but your case may be different
2007-10-23T08:49:00.000Z	usser	marcel	so sudo cp $HOME /media/disk/home_backup
2007-10-23T08:49:00.000Z	usser	marcel	would accomplish this
2007-10-23T08:50:00.000Z	usser	marcel	why would u want to do that :)
2007-10-23T08:50:00.000Z	usser	marcel	sudo cp $HOME /tmp/wahtever
