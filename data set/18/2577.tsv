2010-04-16T15:59:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	g33kergRL	booting over network, or netboot
2010-04-16T16:42:00.000Z	g33kergRL	psycho_oreos	 COULD you please take a look at this? http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/415468/
2010-04-16T16:43:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	g33kergRL	try the beta builds and run wine through that
2010-04-16T16:43:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	g33kergRL	no utorrent beta builds
2010-04-16T16:44:00.000Z	g33kergRL	psycho_oreos	but those are by definition more unstable?!?
2010-04-16T16:44:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	g33kergRL	its the only choice you have imo for the time being to get it to work, or seek similar linux native alternatives
2010-04-16T16:45:00.000Z	g33kergRL	psycho_oreos	sorry to be unclear. it works, and rather fast too, 20 mins per episode, but im worried that all these errmsg might break something
2010-04-16T16:46:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	g33kergRL	if and when it does break something, especially with the files you're getting you may as well get a proper alternative.. utorrent never comes out in linux builds, they prefer linux users to go through wine which lacks lots of capability
2010-04-16T16:47:00.000Z	g33kergRL	psycho_oreos	yes, i will be using that too, but i really need to use utorrent now
2010-04-16T16:48:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	g33kergRL	no buts, qBittorrent looks similar to utorrent or you can try rtorrent
2010-04-16T16:51:00.000Z	g33kergRL	psycho_oreos	yes, i am trying to to complete several downloads, on average 7 to 10 gigs per file, and i need utorrent for that. so, myquestion is, can you help me avoid possible breaking of something, or don't you know how to do that?
2010-04-16T16:51:00.000Z	g33kergRL	psycho_oreos	not to nitpick, but is your help based on your preferential torrent program
2010-04-16T17:03:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	g33kergRL	I don't know
2010-04-16T17:14:00.000Z	g33kergRL	psycho_oreos	jae: "some people just can't get over their holdovers" I could say the same thing about you. Why do you wanna miss this fine opportunity to learn something new? besides, you are experts, the learning curve is not steep easy for you.
2010-04-16T17:15:00.000Z	g33kergRL	psycho_oreos	jae but all the same, thanks for your time and your admission that you don't know
2010-04-16T17:17:00.000Z	psycho_oreos	g33kergRL	there's nothing new to learn with running windows apps under linux, windows API has always been an epic fail
2010-04-16T17:17:00.000Z	g33kergRL	psycho_oreos	thanks again for your time sofar
