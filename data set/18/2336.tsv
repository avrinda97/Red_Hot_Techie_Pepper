2010-06-11T07:21:00.000Z	xyzaffair		using the broadcom STA propriatery in 10.04 but getting poor signal strengths / slow transfers about 1.5mbs at best and im sitting next to an N router, any ideas?
2010-06-11T07:23:00.000Z	pvl1	xyzaffair	1.5 within a lan or the internet
2010-06-11T07:24:00.000Z	xyzaffair	pvl1	within lan
2010-06-11T07:24:00.000Z	xyzaffair	pvl1	was getting about 3.0mb on windows so I know something is wrong and my connection % is bad
2010-06-11T07:25:00.000Z	pvl1	xyzaffair	you sure u got a good driver on it then
2010-06-11T07:25:00.000Z	xyzaffair	pvl1	im using the one from hardware manager the broadcom STA
2010-06-11T07:26:00.000Z	pvl1	xyzaffair	i gotcha. now is this over http? or howd u check it
2010-06-11T07:26:00.000Z	xyzaffair	pvl1	um nfs client/server transfer a big file
2010-06-11T07:27:00.000Z	pvl1	xyzaffair	ok, you sure got ports open and such?
2010-06-11T07:27:00.000Z	xyzaffair	pvl1	that doesn't matter on a lan...
2010-06-11T07:27:00.000Z	pvl1	xyzaffair	it depends on the dhcp server in the router, if you have a modern router, it doesnt matter
2010-06-11T07:28:00.000Z	xyzaffair	pvl1	its an N router, anyway my signal % tells the story its way too low
2010-06-11T07:28:00.000Z	xyzaffair	pvl1	been trying this http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1390979 but I cant get past make. someone else posted same issues I have headers installed but it's not seeing them or something weird.
2010-06-11T07:29:00.000Z	pvl1	xyzaffair	my best guess is the driver is iffy
2010-06-11T07:29:00.000Z	xyzaffair	pvl1	its the one ubuntu ships .....
2010-06-11T07:31:00.000Z	pvl1	xyzaffair	doesnt mean its so wonderful
2010-06-11T07:31:00.000Z	pvl1	xyzaffair	gimme a sec
