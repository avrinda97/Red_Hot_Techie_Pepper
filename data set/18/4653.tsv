2009-06-09T10:28:00.000Z	matrixblue		when ubuntu doesn't recognize a wireless card at all (not listing it in lspci or lshw) what does that mean?
2009-06-09T10:30:00.000Z	rob_p	matrixblue	Is it a USB device?
2009-06-09T10:31:00.000Z	matrixblue	rob_p	no it's built in
2009-06-09T10:31:00.000Z	rob_p	matrixblue	ok
2009-06-09T10:32:00.000Z	rob_p	matrixblue	It should show up on the pci buss then.  Does it work under Windows?
2009-06-09T10:32:00.000Z	matrixblue	rob_p	yeah
2009-06-09T10:32:00.000Z	rob_p	matrixblue	Then it almost *has* to show up with lspci -v
2009-06-09T10:34:00.000Z	matrixblue	rob_p	nope tried just now
2009-06-09T10:35:00.000Z	matrixblue	rob_p	it's a thinkpad t41
2009-06-09T10:35:00.000Z	rob_p	matrixblue	First time I've ever seen that then.  Congrats! :-)
2009-06-09T10:36:00.000Z	matrixblue	rob_p	same here lol
2009-06-09T10:38:00.000Z	rob_p	matrixblue	You don't suppose they did something stupid like hang it on the USB bus via an internal header or something?  lsusb -v  (I don't hold much hope for that.)
2009-06-09T10:38:00.000Z	rob_p	matrixblue	I've seen crazier things...
2009-06-09T10:41:00.000Z	matrixblue	rob_p	in case I'm missing something http://paste.ubuntu.com/191378/
2009-06-09T10:43:00.000Z	rob_p	matrixblue	Yeah, I don't see it either.
2009-06-09T10:44:00.000Z	matrixblue	rob_p	lsusb -v http://paste.ubuntu.com/191380/
2009-06-09T10:45:00.000Z	rob_p	matrixblue	Yeah, not there either.  Bummer dude!
2009-06-09T10:45:00.000Z	matrixblue	rob_p	yeah I'm not giving up though
