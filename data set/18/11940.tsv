2007-06-30T15:58:00.000Z	arooni		is there something i can do to make my dlink wifi card more powerful?  it barely picks up a signal thats pretty strong (not sure what drivers its using)
2007-06-30T16:00:00.000Z	mwe	arooni	iwconfig txpower if the driver supports it
2007-06-30T16:01:00.000Z	mwe	arooni	sudo iwconfig wlan0 txpower 40 mW (or whatever your interface name is)
2007-07-01T16:01:00.000Z	mwe	arooni	iwconfig should show the current value
2007-07-01T16:02:00.000Z	arooni	mwe	that was an invalid value
2007-07-01T16:03:00.000Z	arooni	mwe	sudo iwconfig ath0 txpower 40 mW
2007-07-01T16:04:00.000Z	mwe	arooni	not supported by the driver then
2007-07-01T16:04:00.000Z	arooni	mwe	is there anything else i can do?
2007-07-01T16:05:00.000Z	mwe	arooni	I'm not that familiar with the madwifi driver
2007-07-01T16:05:00.000Z	arooni		ah ok
2007-07-01T16:06:00.000Z	arooni		next q:  i have a sound blaster live PCI card .... and it supports 5.1 audio output... but right now i'm only getting audio out from my front two speakers.  what should i do?
2007-07-01T16:07:00.000Z	mwe	arooni	try another value
2007-07-01T16:08:00.000Z	mwe	arooni	sudo iwconfig ath0 txpower 20
2007-07-01T16:08:00.000Z	mwe	arooni	sudo iwconfig ath0 txpower or 14 or something
2007-07-01T16:08:00.000Z	mwe	arooni	maybe it has a limit
2007-07-01T16:09:00.000Z	arooni	mwe	i can go up to 19
2007-07-01T16:09:00.000Z	mwe	arooni	should be plenty
2007-07-01T16:10:00.000Z	mwe	arooni	I think iwconfig txpower X is in dBm if it's not postfixed by mW
