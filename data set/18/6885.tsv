2008-03-13T20:18:00.000Z	pawan		hi
2008-03-13T20:18:00.000Z	pawan		i have to press control D every time to load ubuntu
2008-03-13T20:19:00.000Z	zoomboot8	pawan	is it because the UUIDs don't match up?
2008-03-13T20:19:00.000Z	zoomboot8	pawan	perhaps you changed some of the partitions after installing ubuntu?
2008-03-13T20:20:00.000Z	zoomboot8	pawan	step 1, go to a terminal and type "sudo gedit /etc/fstab"
2008-03-13T20:20:00.000Z	zoomboot8	pawan	you cannot fix it from windows
2008-03-13T20:29:00.000Z	zoomboot8	pawan	ok good. open up 2 terminals, ok?
2008-03-13T20:30:00.000Z	zoomboot8	pawan	in one of them, type "sudo gedit /etc/fstab"
2008-03-13T20:30:00.000Z	zoomboot8	pawan	in the other terminal, type "blkid"
2008-03-13T20:31:00.000Z	zoomboot8	pawan	you should make sure the UUIDs from "blkid" are the same as the ones in the fstab file
2008-03-13T20:32:00.000Z	zoomboot8	pawan	http://paste.ubuntu-nl.org/
2008-03-13T20:33:00.000Z	zoomboot8	pawan	and the output from blkid?
2008-03-13T20:34:00.000Z	zoomboot8	pawan	pastebin the output from blkid?
2008-03-13T20:39:00.000Z	zoomboot8	pawan	ok, you need to remove 2 lines from the gedit file
2008-03-13T20:40:00.000Z	zoomboot8	pawan	from the pastebin, remove lines 15 and 16... the lines that start out as "# /dev/sdb3" and as "UUID=6368746f-2074-616b-6f65-207575696400"
2008-03-13T20:43:00.000Z	zoomboot8	pawan	and save the file in gedit, and when you reboot next time, tehre should be no problem with having to press ctrl-D
2008-03-13T20:49:00.000Z	zoomboot8	pawan	glad to hear it :)
2008-03-13T20:50:00.000Z	zoomboot8	pawan	because it happened to me, too, whenever I changed my partitions
