2009-08-30T03:56:00.000Z	TNk		Greetings. I'm trying to set up a fixed IP Adress for wlan0 following this guide "http://codesnippets.joyent.com/posts/show/319" but All I get is a broken connection. Any suggestion?
2009-08-30T03:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TNk	you can specify ips if you edit /etc/network/interfaces

2009-08-30T03:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TNk	its a real easy file to edit
2009-08-30T03:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TNk	your page is pretty much the same
2009-08-30T03:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TNk	make sure you add the name servers to /etc/resolv.conf
2009-08-30T03:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TNk	you will need to change the eth0 to wlan0 / ath0 or whatever your wifi adapter is named as
2009-08-30T04:00:00.000Z	TNk	ActionParsnip	I'll Pastebin the "Modified" interfaces file and the resolv.conf file I am using. Maybe you could detect the error.
2009-08-30T04:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TNk	sure

2009-08-30T04:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TNk	looks fine
2009-08-30T04:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TNk	does   sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
2009-08-30T04:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TNk	give any errors
2009-08-30T04:07:00.000Z	TNk	ActionParsnip	It does give an output, let me check.
2009-08-30T04:08:00.000Z	TNk	ActionParsnip	Is there any command like "history" but to check outputs instead of inputs? or something similar?
2009-08-30T04:08:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	TNk	dmesg may give clues
2009-08-30T04:10:00.000Z	TNk	ActionParsnip	I'll mod the file, run net restart and paste you the output.
2009-08-30T05:48:00.000Z	TNk	ActionParsnip	Success
