2005-12-04T11:20:00.000Z	dabaR	slashx1896	what program, we will definitely need to know that.
2005-12-04T11:21:00.000Z	dabaR	slashx1896	if it does not have pop3 and only has pop, then use that, and it will work. if it is not, perhaps other options are wrong, that one is not.
2005-12-04T11:22:00.000Z	dabaR	slashx1896	the part of the email address before the @ sign

2005-12-14T10:16:00.000Z	dabaR	slashx1896	there is limewire for gnu/linux systems, and limewire sucks, there is a better free program
2005-12-14T10:16:00.000Z	slashx1896	dabaR	like?
2005-12-14T10:17:00.000Z	dabaR	slashx1896	it is called gtk-gnutella, and limewire can wish it was ok like that.
2005-12-14T10:17:00.000Z	slashx1896	dabaR	i think gnutella sux
2005-12-14T10:17:00.000Z	dabaR	slashx1896	why is limewire better?
