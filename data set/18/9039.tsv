2007-10-19T20:54:00.000Z	Espen		Ive got a problem with the boot CD, can anyone help me? "/
2007-10-19T20:54:00.000Z	stray77	Espen	what is the problem?
2007-10-19T20:56:00.000Z	Espen	stray77	, When i boot from the xd, i get to the menu, but when i try starting the installation, i get the message "PROBLEM: Cant read from boot device"
2007-10-19T20:57:00.000Z	stray77	Espen	at the install screen choose the test cd option first, itll tell you if you got a bad cd
2007-10-19T20:57:00.000Z	stray77	Espen	also if you have to reburn a copy, check the md5sum for the iso to make sure its not corrupted
2007-10-19T20:58:00.000Z	Espen	stray77	, i tried both, got the same message with the "Test" thing, and it was correct in the md5sum
2007-10-19T21:00:00.000Z	stray77	Espen	that means the .iso file is good, but the cd you burned is corrupted in some way. try reburning the .iso on different media or at a slower speed.
2007-10-19T21:01:00.000Z	Espen	stray77	,  i tried burning on 2 different cd's at half off the speed that was printed on the CD
2007-10-19T21:02:00.000Z	stray77	Espen	are you burning with the same drive that you are then trying to install with? or installing on a different system?
2007-10-19T21:02:00.000Z	Espen	stray77	, im burning with the same system i'm trying to install on, yes
2007-10-19T21:03:00.000Z	stray77	Espen	is your burner set to master, slave or cable select?
2007-10-19T21:03:00.000Z	Espen	stray77	,  i dont know
2007-10-19T21:06:00.000Z	Espen	stray77	,  i dont know what it is
2007-10-19T21:07:00.000Z	stray77	Espen	well id suggest making sure it is set to master on your secondary ide controller
2007-10-19T21:07:00.000Z	Espen	stray77	,  i dont know how to do it..
2007-10-19T21:08:00.000Z	stray77	Espen	there are jumpers on the back of your burner, usually labeled mas, slv, cs.  put the jumper on mas and remove any other device from the same ide cable.
2007-10-19T21:09:00.000Z	Espen	stray77	,  i doubt that's the problem, ive had my friend burning a CD to me
