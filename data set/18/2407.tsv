2010-05-22T22:48:00.000Z	chegney		Hi looking for tips on installing a minimal version 10 system, i've downloaded the minimal cd and started installing with that
2010-05-22T22:48:00.000Z	chegney		I want a base system with X gnome gdm and openbox
2010-05-22T22:48:00.000Z	eye-zak	chegney	gui or no gui
2010-05-22T22:49:00.000Z	eye-zak	chegney	install packages with APT::Install-Recommends=false (or appropriate option in aptitude) to ensure a minimal set of dependencies
2010-05-22T22:51:00.000Z	chegney	eye-zak	would instructions on this site still be valid? http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1155961
2010-05-22T22:52:00.000Z	eye-zak	chegney	i'm not sure, it looks like it has most of the stuff you need but you will not have as many packages without the depends
2010-05-22T22:52:00.000Z	eye-zak	chegney	you need gnome-session, nautilus,gnome-panel and gdm to get a basic basic session
2010-05-22T22:53:00.000Z	eye-zak	chegney	but that also will give you metacity
2010-05-22T23:11:00.000Z	eye-zak	chegney	always the best option to install base system first
2010-05-23T03:33:00.000Z	eye-zak	chegney	install openbox gdm and gnome-session to start, but you will have to configure it for openbox later
2010-05-23T09:15:00.000Z	eye-zak	chegney	do you know how to use aptitude
2010-05-23T09:16:00.000Z	chegney	eye-zak	yes, I'm just wondering if there is a metapackage I can use to acomplish this
2010-05-23T09:17:00.000Z	eye-zak	chegney	not really 'ubuntu-desktop' is the meta for gnome ubuntu desktop gdm and gnome-session have all major dependencies to start an xsession
2010-05-23T09:17:00.000Z	eye-zak	chegney	install openbox first, so it can be used to satisfy x-window-manager dependency
2010-05-23T09:17:00.000Z	chegney	eye-zak	does ubuntu-desktop install games and stuff too?
2010-05-23T09:18:00.000Z	eye-zak	chegney	you can mark a bunch of things and then see what they mark as a consequence (undo menu is your friend)
2010-05-23T09:19:00.000Z	eye-zak	chegney	in the preferences for aptitude, set Install-Recommends to false to limit dependencies to only those which are necessary
2010-05-23T09:19:00.000Z	eye-zak	chegney	start with ubuntu-standard it has bash-completion and a few extra niceties
