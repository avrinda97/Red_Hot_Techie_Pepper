2008-04-07T15:48:00.000Z	sami		I have an preseeded install for an unattended install. I need kdm to work with AD interaction and need KDM to be installed w/o any questions.
2008-04-07T15:50:00.000Z	sami		KDM not KDE
2008-04-07T15:50:00.000Z	sami		I don't want KDE
2008-04-07T15:51:00.000Z	sami		When i have GDM and try to install KDM i get a question shellwise which DM i want to use. I want to skip that question telling it to only choose KDM automaticlly
2008-04-07T15:53:00.000Z	sami		It's an apt question..
2008-04-07T15:54:00.000Z	sami		Can i for example pipe a answer to apt.
2008-04-07T15:55:00.000Z	unop__	sami	what do you mean exactly?
2008-04-07T15:56:00.000Z	sami	unop_	When i'm apt-getting kdm i get an ncurses gui that wants me to choose GDM or KDM. I don't want that gui i just want it to automaticlly choose kdm over gdm. no questions asked
2008-04-07T15:57:00.000Z	sami	unop_	apt-get changes the init scripts for boot but if i change them manually the question will still popup.
2008-04-07T15:57:00.000Z	unop__	sami	sure, sudo dpkg-reconfigure -plow debconf .. and choose 'high'
2008-04-07T15:58:00.000Z	sami	unop_	What does that exactlly do?
2008-04-07T15:58:00.000Z	unop__	sami	some question just cannot be ignored tho .. as they are important to how your system is configured
2008-04-07T15:58:00.000Z	unop__	sami	apt-cache show debconf .. and you'll get an idea
2008-04-07T16:00:00.000Z	sami	unop_	Yes, well wont that affect all questions? Because the default answer would be GDM and i want it to change to kdm
2008-04-07T16:01:00.000Z	unop__	sami	if you have the GDM already (or KDE for that matter) and you install another DM (whether directly or through another package) .. it is quite logical to be asked whether you want the new DM to take over so as to avoid some nasty surprises (this isn't an example of where things can go very wrong, but there are instances where you must tell the installer just what to do)
2008-04-07T16:02:00.000Z	unop__		s/KDE/KDM/
2008-04-07T16:02:00.000Z	sami	unop_	I guess i will just have to prompt the user for an answer and tell them what to choose
2008-04-07T16:02:00.000Z	unop__	sami	setting the debconf priority to high ensures that you are only asked questions that are critical (and need some input from you)
