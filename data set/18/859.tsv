2012-02-22T07:33:00.000Z	acidrain_		i need an in depth guide on how to setup the ethernet cable to linux box and make it work
2012-02-22T07:34:00.000Z	acidrain_		i wish it were that easy lol
2012-02-22T07:35:00.000Z	acidrain_		ive tried that
2012-02-22T07:36:00.000Z	acidrain_		how do i determine ethernet chip?
2012-02-22T07:36:00.000Z	Ben64	acidrain_	what happens if you do "ifconfig"
2012-02-22T07:37:00.000Z	acidrain_	Ben64	it shows eth1 as a network interface
2012-02-22T07:38:00.000Z	Ben64	acidrain_	then you probably just need to set up ip address or dhcp or something like that
2012-02-22T07:38:00.000Z	Ben64	acidrain_	try to set ip manually and ping the router or another computer on the network
2012-02-22T07:39:00.000Z	acidrain_	Ben64	i have also tried to setup dhcp. i set it to 192.168.1.107 with network mask of 255.255.255.0 and gateway of router ip 192.168.1.1
2012-02-22T07:39:00.000Z	acidrain_	Ben64	i also reserved it on the router, at this point, it said it was connected. but it lied
2012-02-22T07:40:00.000Z	acidrain_	Ben64	ActionParsnip do you have any other suggested ideas?
2012-02-22T07:41:00.000Z	Ben64	acidrain_	try connecting it to a switch and another computer, no router, and setting ip addresses manually
2012-02-22T07:42:00.000Z	acidrain_	Ben64	explain?
2012-02-22T07:42:00.000Z	Ben64	acidrain_	linux isn't windows
2012-02-22T07:43:00.000Z	acidrain_	Ben64	-.- linux till this day has been epic win.
2012-02-22T07:44:00.000Z	acidrain_	Ben64	does it matter what i enter as the client name on the router?
2012-02-22T07:45:00.000Z	Ben64	acidrain_	i'm not sure what you mean, which is why i suggested a switch
