2007-06-14T15:02:00.000Z	dyrne	ivan	lsmod | grep nvidia will tell you or just lsmod if you want to scroll through it. id do 'grep Driver /etc/X11/xorg.conf' thats what you are concerned about
2007-06-14T15:02:00.000Z	ivan	dyrne	oh ok
2007-06-14T15:02:00.000Z	ivan	dyrne	1 sec
2007-06-14T15:03:00.000Z	dyrne	ivan	sudo /etc/init.d/gdm stop first before running installer
2007-06-14T15:03:00.000Z	ivan	dyrne	xorg.conf shows nvidia driver as being used . but i wanna knwo what version
