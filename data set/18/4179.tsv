2009-05-23T22:03:00.000Z	Tarthen	sdls	I doubt; they'd clash
2009-05-23T22:04:00.000Z	sdls	Tarthen	what if you specified a different installed directory, assuming that is possible of course
2009-05-23T22:04:00.000Z	Tarthen	sdls	Yeah, possible
2009-05-23T22:05:00.000Z	Tarthen	sdls	You'd have to compile from source tho
2009-05-23T22:05:00.000Z	sdls	Tarthen	I was really hoping to NOT do that, lol
2009-05-23T22:06:00.000Z	Tarthen	sdls	Eh, you've never used Linux properly until you've compiled source
2009-05-23T22:06:00.000Z	sdls	Tarthen	I use Gentoo as my primary distribution, and I've built quite a few.  Enough to know what trouble it is
2009-05-23T22:07:00.000Z	sdls	Tarthen	I was hoping for an easy way out
2009-05-23T22:07:00.000Z	Tarthen	sdls	Well, I'm not sure if you could chroot it
2009-05-23T22:09:00.000Z	sdls	Tarthen	That is a good idea actually.  But let me try the source first, as that could possibly get rather difficult.   If source gives me enough trouble, I'll look into chroot
2009-05-23T22:10:00.000Z	Tarthen	sdls	Haha. What are you exactly running?
2009-05-23T22:11:00.000Z	sdls	Tarthen	I installed Ubuntu 9.04 i386 version from DVD on my gaming box, I was ready to explode with Windows, the stupid &$^%*#$.  I'm playing games via wine.  I got kotor 1 & 2 to work as well as Steam.  There are a few more I want working, but it would appear that only certain versions of wine can mmake them work.  I want to run the best wine for my games!
2009-05-23T22:12:00.000Z	sdls	Tarthen	Actually, it is not so much my games, but the family's games.  I don't have time for that anymore.
2009-05-23T22:12:00.000Z	Tarthen	sdls	Ah. Isn't there an app for game-specific hacks?
2009-05-23T22:18:00.000Z	sdls	Tarthen	Crossover I think it is called...but I believe you pay for it.
2009-05-23T22:23:00.000Z	sdls	Tarthen	Around $40 is still better than around 100+ for windows
2009-05-23T22:23:00.000Z	sdls	Tarthen	I'm sorry, that was meant for SultansElephant
