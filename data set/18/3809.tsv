2009-07-28T11:36:00.000Z	abhijit_		ok
2009-07-28T11:36:00.000Z	losher	abhijit_	why not just use firefox. It's as powerful as firefox, guaranteed...
2009-07-28T11:39:00.000Z	losher	abhijit_	you can open two firefox instances simultaneously if you want to. Use the profile manager and the no-remote options.
2009-07-28T11:40:00.000Z	abhijit_	losher	if i open two firefox at a time but is it possible then to open two different yahoo mail id on that two firefox instance?
2009-07-28T11:40:00.000Z	losher	abhijit_	if you use two different profiles, the two firefoxes will be completely independent. Simpler to open one firefox and one opera though...
2009-07-28T11:43:00.000Z	losher	abhijit_	which suggestion? And doesn't work how?
2009-07-28T11:43:00.000Z	losher	abhijit_	you are a master of brevity...
2009-07-28T11:45:00.000Z	abhijit_	losher	when i open 1st firefox then i open 2nd instance. then on 2nd instance i have to sing out first account then sign in again for new account but after doing this when i go back to 1st instace then there is also new account is logged in and it ask password
2009-07-28T11:46:00.000Z	losher	abhijit_	that's because you aren't using different profiles. Use one opera and one firefox. It will be much easier....
