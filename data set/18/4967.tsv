2009-08-13T04:12:00.000Z	arand	MOUD	use -d option (see apt-get --help for this and other options)
2009-08-13T04:13:00.000Z	MOUD	arand	I'm reading it, thanks :)
2009-08-13T04:21:00.000Z	arand	MOUD	so does that apt-get command give any errors for build-essential?
2009-08-13T04:23:00.000Z	MOUD	arand	no, I just closed the terminal and opened a new one. thanks for the help
2009-08-15T20:54:00.000Z	MOUD	arand	do you use hibernate? I think that the computer gets somewhat slow after the hibernate
2009-08-15T21:00:00.000Z	arand	MOUD	in theory at least, hibernation should not impact performance, anything else I would presume is down to bugs...
2009-08-15T21:01:00.000Z	MOUD	arand	it used to get slower when I used ubunto 8.04 so I never used it again.
2009-08-15T21:04:00.000Z	MOUD	arand	According to what I saw on some linux forums, if you are going to use hibernation then you need to have at least a swap size bigger or equal to your RAM size
2009-08-15T21:05:00.000Z	arand	MOUD	yes, since ram is dumped to swapspace, and the recovered when you unfreeze.
2009-08-15T21:06:00.000Z	MOUD	arand	exactly, it's like on windows
2009-08-16T18:50:00.000Z	arand	MOUD	ndiswrapper
2009-08-19T18:29:00.000Z	arand	MOUD	I think the only line to change is shiretoko -> firefox , if you edit the default string
2009-08-19T18:25:00.000Z	arand	MOUD	Does the homepage not work?
2009-08-19T18:26:00.000Z	MOUD	arand	It tells me that my browser is incompatible -.-
2009-08-19T18:26:00.000Z	arand	MOUD	and what browser are you using?
2009-08-19T18:28:00.000Z	arand	MOUD	then try a user agent switcher to identify it as firefox rather than shiretoko?
2009-08-19T18:28:00.000Z	MOUD	arand	just installed it, I'll give a try
2009-08-19T18:40:00.000Z	MOUD	arand	I added Firefox to the User Agent, it seems to be working. tks
