2011-07-28T23:18:00.000Z	felipe_Brz		I have a fresh 11.04 install, so when I try to play .mp3 files it seems I don't have the necessary "files" or codecs or whatever so ubuntu prompts me to download them. I start the download but the speed is of the download is in the order of 100 bytes per sec... Is there something wrong here?
2011-07-28T23:19:00.000Z	edbian	felipe_Brz	Try changing your server.  The default one is usually overrun with other people using so it is slow / possibly very far away from you.
2011-07-28T23:19:00.000Z	felipe_Brz	edbian	italoxp  : thank you
2011-07-28T23:20:00.000Z	edbian	felipe_Brz	sure.
2011-07-29T04:14:00.000Z	edbian	felipe_Brz	are you using sudo rm ??
2011-07-29T04:15:00.000Z	felipe_Brz	edbian	 K-Rich:  I would like it not to require a passwd... I've just thought of something though, I'll try it now
2011-07-29T04:18:00.000Z	felipe_Brz	edbian	I would like this user not to require a password to do 'sudo' stuff because I'll be using it in Filezilla to upload files... Does that mean I have to add it to the 'sudo' group instead? Since  that's the group I can remove password need for, via 'visudo'??
2011-07-29T04:18:00.000Z	edbian	felipe_Brz	I'm not sure.  I've never done that.  I'm worried that doing so might be a security vulnerability
2011-12-24T04:31:00.000Z	edbian	felipe_Brz	look harder, unless you manually took it out, it's still in there
2011-12-24T04:32:00.000Z	edbian	felipe_Brz	log in as a user that can sudo.  Is admin listed in the output of 'groups' ??
2011-12-24T04:32:00.000Z	felipe_Brz	edbian	I may have manually taken it out.... I was following a website where it was written that to add a user to a group you had to "adduser <groupname> <username>" but it's the other way around
2011-12-24T04:32:00.000Z	felipe_Brz	edbian	let me see
2011-12-24T04:33:00.000Z	edbian	felipe_Brz	ok
2011-12-24T04:33:00.000Z	felipe_Brz	edbian	 i just did vim /etc/group and there's no admin group there
2011-12-24T04:33:00.000Z	edbian	felipe_Brz	Is there a reference to the admin group in your /etc/sudoers?
2011-12-24T04:35:00.000Z	felipe_Brz	edbian	 there is, but it's commented out
2011-12-24T04:35:00.000Z	edbian	felipe_Brz	well at this point you can start adding users to the /etc/sudoers file manually or you can recreate the admin group, fix the sudoers file so it's not commented out, and add the users you want to that group
2011-12-24T04:35:00.000Z	edbian	felipe_Brz	it's up to you :)
