2010-07-11T08:49:00.000Z	Adola		hey!  If I wanted to delete the whole partition, is it: sudo rm -rf /  ?
2010-07-11T08:49:00.000Z	Adola		I need to delete EVERYTHING.
2010-07-11T08:49:00.000Z	Adola		Ubuntu 10.04
2010-07-11T08:49:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Adola	Use gparted and delete the whole partition, it's faster. And please don't paste that command in this channel, for any reason, again.
2010-07-11T08:50:00.000Z	Adola	Jordan_U	Ok, sorry about that, but I need it without gparted, and with terminal.
2010-07-11T08:51:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Adola	Find the partition and "sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdXY". But be *very* carefull to choose the right partition, for obvious reasons.
2010-07-11T08:52:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Adola	So you need the data to be irrecoverable?
2010-07-11T08:52:00.000Z	Adola	Jordan_U	I need to just delete this whole HDD.
2010-07-11T08:53:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Adola	It can either be done in about 3 seconds or a few hours, depending on whether the data is something like credit card numbers than you need to be irrecoverable.
2010-07-11T08:53:00.000Z	Adola	Jordan_U	Just don't need it to boot again.
2010-07-11T08:55:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Adola	"sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdX bs=1 count=1" (where /dev/sdX is something like /dev/sda). **warning for anyone else, this will make all data unreadable***
2010-07-11T08:56:00.000Z	Adola	Jordan_U	Thank man :]
2010-07-11T08:56:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Adola	You're welcome.
2010-07-11T09:05:00.000Z	Adola	Jordan_U	How shoudl that command behave?
2010-07-11T09:06:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Adola	If you're currently booted from that drive then everything would likely freeze up, yes :)
2010-07-11T09:07:00.000Z	Adola	Jordan_U	Ok ;]
2010-07-12T05:17:00.000Z	Jordan_U	Adola	You're welcome.
2010-07-12T05:17:00.000Z	Adola	Jordan_U	Saved me about....So many hours of pain ;]
