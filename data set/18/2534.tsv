2010-04-30T16:49:00.000Z	dabaR	karthiksharu_	so you know which partitions you are going to resize how?
2010-04-30T16:50:00.000Z	dabaR	karthiksharu_	you can probably do a lot of that live.
2010-04-30T16:50:00.000Z	dabaR	karthiksharu_	you have a bunch of partitions that you are about to delete?
2010-04-30T16:51:00.000Z	karthiksharu_	dabaR	yes correct ...  Is there anything to be worried ??
2010-04-30T16:52:00.000Z	dabaR	karthiksharu_	well, one other way than what you've already heard would be to basically delete the partitions now from your current installation. Then create a bigger partition out of those deleted partitions
2010-04-30T16:52:00.000Z	dabaR	karthiksharu_	then copy over stuff from the home partition, and change that to be the partition that is mounted as home.
2010-04-30T16:53:00.000Z	dabaR	karthiksharu_	I don't know if that is basically what you want.
2010-04-30T16:53:00.000Z	karthiksharu_	dabaR	yeah .. that shounds good ...
2010-04-30T16:53:00.000Z	dabaR	karthiksharu_	but then the old home stays unused. That's the downside.
2010-04-30T16:53:00.000Z	dabaR	karthiksharu_	you can however reformat it, and mount it as something like /home/pr0n
2010-04-30T16:54:00.000Z	karthiksharu_	dabaR	So you dont suggest me going with the live cd + gparted ?
2010-04-30T16:54:00.000Z	dabaR	karthiksharu_	you could. Whichever works better for you.
2010-04-30T16:55:00.000Z	dabaR	karthiksharu_	but resizing a parrtition, I would certainly back up if I cared about the data.
2010-04-30T16:55:00.000Z	dabaR	karthiksharu_	if you interrupt for some reason a resizing, puff, all data gone basically
2010-04-30T16:56:00.000Z	karthiksharu_	dabaR	ohh I see ...
