2008-11-13T04:47:00.000Z	Meshach		How do I login as root in a folder?
2008-11-13T04:49:00.000Z	Meshach		There is a folder that says owner is "root" and I can't create a new file in it...
2008-11-13T04:50:00.000Z	Meshach		should I CHMOD it to 777?
2008-11-13T04:50:00.000Z	fryguy	Meshach	no
2008-11-13T04:50:00.000Z	fryguy	Meshach	create the file as root, or provide more specific details
2008-11-13T05:27:00.000Z	fryguy	Meshach	run gedit, write the script, save the file...
2008-11-13T05:27:00.000Z	Meshach	fryguy	I mean using the terminal
2008-11-13T05:28:00.000Z	fryguy	Meshach	gedit is a graphical application.  What do you mean?
2008-11-13T05:32:00.000Z	Meshach	fryguy	I tried to save a file in a folder owned by root and it says I don't have permission.
2008-11-13T05:32:00.000Z	fryguy	Meshach	so then save the file as root, or save it to a different directory
2008-11-13T05:33:00.000Z	fryguy	Meshach	if the directory is owned by root you probably shouldn't be putting things there
2008-11-13T05:33:00.000Z	Meshach	fryguy	How do I save the file as root? Also, it has to be in the same folder
2008-11-13T05:33:00.000Z	fryguy	Meshach	like i said, you are probably working with the wrong directory because of some misconception you have.  to work as root, use sudo or gksu
2008-11-13T05:34:00.000Z	Meshach	fryguy	How do I use sudo when I'm in the graphical application: gedit?
2008-11-13T05:34:00.000Z	fryguy	Meshach	use gksu, as i just mentioned
2008-11-13T05:34:00.000Z	Meshach	fryguy	I'm so sorry for my complete ignorance but how do I use gksu?
2008-11-13T05:40:00.000Z	fryguy	Meshach	super user do
2008-11-13T05:41:00.000Z	Meshach	fryguy	Cool, thanks!
