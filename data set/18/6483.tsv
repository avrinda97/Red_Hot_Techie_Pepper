2008-10-30T19:05:00.000Z	joaopinto	Mb81	you mean a mysql server ?
2008-10-30T19:06:00.000Z	joaopinto	Mb81	is that mysql server setup for listening on the proper IP address ? By default mysql server is bind to localhost
2008-10-30T19:07:00.000Z	joaopinto	Mb81	it is not about pinging, it's about change the mysql server configuration to make the service available remotely
2008-10-30T19:08:00.000Z	joaopinto	Mb81	you need to change it, check your /etc/mysql
2008-10-30T19:08:00.000Z	joaopinto	Mb81	jdbc has nothing to do with this talk :)
2008-10-30T19:11:00.000Z	joaopinto	Mb81	no you do not
2008-10-30T19:11:00.000Z	joaopinto	Mb81	have you changed your mysql server config already ?
2008-10-30T19:11:00.000Z	joaopinto	Mb81	did you restart mysql after the change ?
2008-10-30T19:12:00.000Z	joaopinto	Mb81	also did you granted privileges to remote connections, with the mysql grant command ?
2008-10-30T19:13:00.000Z	joaopinto	Mb81	what error are you getting ? please pastebin
2008-10-30T19:14:00.000Z	joaopinto	Mb81	you are trying to connect to the local server, not to the remote
2008-10-30T19:14:00.000Z	joaopinto	Mb81	you are not specifying an remote server, that's your problem
2008-10-30T19:15:00.000Z	joaopinto	Mb81	please read the mysql man page, man mysql
2008-10-30T19:17:00.000Z	joaopinto	Mb81	is not about configuration, is about your lack of knowledge on how to use the mysql client, please read the manpage or a tutotiral
