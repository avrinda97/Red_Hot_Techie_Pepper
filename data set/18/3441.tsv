2009-10-18T23:16:00.000Z	Um_cara_qualquer		i'm no sure what do you mean
2009-10-18T23:17:00.000Z	losha	Um_cara_qualquer	open a terminal and type ls -l /dev/cdrom & tell us what it says
2009-10-18T23:18:00.000Z	losha	Um_cara_qualquer	oops. That & wasn't part of the command :-). Try again: ls -l /dev/cdrom
2009-10-18T23:20:00.000Z	Um_cara_qualquer	losha	lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 3 2009-10-18 06:06 /dev/cdrom -> sr0
2009-10-18T23:20:00.000Z	losha	Um_cara_qualquer	and now ls -l /dev/sr0
2009-10-18T23:21:00.000Z	Um_cara_qualquer	losha	erUSUL brw-rw----+ 1 root cdrom 11, 0 2009-10-18 04:06 /dev/sr0
2009-10-18T23:22:00.000Z	losha	Um_cara_qualquer	As erUSUL suggests, only the root user and the group cdrom have write access to your cdrom currently
2009-10-18T23:24:00.000Z	losha	Um_cara_qualquer	yes, you need to logout then log back in for group changes...
2009-12-05T00:56:00.000Z	losha	Um_cara_qualquer	yeah, the bottom one, divx/mpeg4
2009-12-05T00:56:00.000Z	Um_cara_qualquer	losha	Here is the last bottom
2009-12-05T00:58:00.000Z	losha	Um_cara_qualquer	is it working?
2009-12-05T00:58:00.000Z	Um_cara_qualquer	losha	 well... it is running... but i'm not sure if it converts to .avi
2009-12-05T00:59:00.000Z	Um_cara_qualquer	losha	oh yes... it is .avi :D
2009-12-05T00:59:00.000Z	losha	Um_cara_qualquer	it takes a while....
