2006-10-20T06:10:00.000Z	Cymage		I would still use ndiswrapper, but could try the broadcom firmware thing. i dont remember what it was called
2006-10-20T06:12:00.000Z	timothy		cymage: i think i know what you are talking about but i tried it and it does not want to work
2006-10-20T06:13:00.000Z	Cymage	timothy	then the only other option is to blacklist the bcm43xx native driver and use ndiswrapper
