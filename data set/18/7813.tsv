2007-11-20T12:07:00.000Z	bazhang	xivanari	gutsy is ubuntu 7.10 compiz-fusion is the window compositor
2007-11-20T12:12:00.000Z	bazhang	xivanari	you should have something in your preferences called advanced desktop effects manager now
2007-11-20T12:53:00.000Z	bazhang	xivanari	do you have the plugins installed?
2007-11-20T12:56:00.000Z	bazhang	xivanari	do you have the plugins installed? you can check in synaptic by looking under compiz (search)
2007-11-20T12:58:00.000Z	bazhang	xivanari	you want to get the 3d cube effect, or the expose effect, or what please specify
2007-11-20T12:59:00.000Z	bazhang	xivanari	look in the settings manager and check the key bindings
2007-11-20T12:59:00.000Z	xivanari	bazhang	how do i do that?
2007-11-20T12:59:00.000Z	xivanari	bazhang	what settings manager?

2007-11-20T13:00:00.000Z	xivanari	bazhang	ok im in that, then where do i find the key bindings?
2007-11-20T13:02:00.000Z	bazhang	xivanari	look in viewport switcher and check tab for key bindings
2007-11-20T13:03:00.000Z	xivanari	bazhang	i only see two tabs, desktop based viewport switching and actions
2007-11-20T13:04:00.000Z	bazhang	xivanari	you need to setup the key bindings or the desktop corner to initiate it
2007-11-20T13:08:00.000Z	bazhang	xivanari	you need to set them in the actions section
2007-11-20T13:24:00.000Z	bazhang	xivanari	you could try in #compiz-fusion
