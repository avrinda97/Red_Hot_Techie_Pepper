2006-08-27T08:51:00.000Z	MegaMasterX		anyone else know?
2006-08-27T08:52:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	MegaMasterX	 these are  usb or ps2 keyboards? how old is this pc?
2006-08-27T08:52:00.000Z	MegaMasterX	Dr_Willis	Not even a year old
2006-08-27T08:53:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	MegaMasterX	 im suprised a yr old pc even HAS ps2 any more. :P   ive had all sorts of oddties with usb. but never ps2.. you dident plug the thing into the ps2 mouse connector port did ya? :P
2006-08-27T08:53:00.000Z	MegaMasterX	Dr_Willis	It works until the Kernel loads, and it's in the keyboard port
2006-08-27T08:54:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	MegaMasterX	 so it works with grub eh?
2006-08-27T08:54:00.000Z	MegaMasterX	Dr_Willis	We cant find out, because the kernel loads and the keyboard doesn't respond
2006-08-27T08:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	MegaMasterX	 I mean in the grub menus... ya got  'does it work in the bios menus' then 'the grub menus' then the actual booted os. :P
2006-08-27T08:55:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	MegaMasterX	 i got a weird pc tht the keyboards work in bios menus and the OS. but NOT in the grub menus . :)
2006-08-27T08:55:00.000Z	MegaMasterX	Dr_Willis	It works in grub menus
2006-08-27T08:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	MegaMasterX	  could check out the bios and perhaps try disabling the Plug and Play feature. (just grabbing at straws here)
2006-08-27T08:56:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	MegaMasterX	 also.. Hmm.. can ya ssh into the box from another pc? or cant even get it to install? im wondering if the psaux modules are loading.
2006-08-27T08:57:00.000Z	MegaMasterX	Dr_Willis	?
2006-08-27T08:59:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	MegaMasterX	 its often called somthing else. or hidden in some sub menu.      Other then that.. id say test out some various different live cd's and see if any of them work right.
2006-08-27T09:00:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	MegaMasterX	 try DIFFERNT live cd's not just the ubuntu one. It may be some odd kernel issue.
2006-08-27T09:00:00.000Z	MegaMasterX	Dr_Willis	Ok, me and my friend will try that
2006-08-27T09:01:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	MegaMasterX	 the DSL live cd is a good tool to haver in any case. :P 50mb of save-your-backside-goodness
