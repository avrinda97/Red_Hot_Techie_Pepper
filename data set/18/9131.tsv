2008-11-08T08:49:00.000Z	itson		what tool can i use to setup xconf.org again?
2008-11-08T08:49:00.000Z	ziroday	itson	err, just edit the text file?
2008-11-08T15:14:00.000Z	ziroday	itson	what are you trying to do?
2008-11-08T15:15:00.000Z	itson	ziroday	i have a fresh install of ubuntu on virtual machine ( im on mac running Parallels Desktop ) and im tryiing to get higher resolution
2008-11-08T15:16:00.000Z	ziroday	itson	okay, and what goes wrong when running the command dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2008-11-08T15:17:00.000Z	itson	ziroday	nothing comes up, just one line saying "xserver-xorg postinst warning: overwriting possibly-customised configuration file; backup in blabla
2008-11-08T15:18:00.000Z	ziroday	itson	okay, and it doesn't save your new /etc/X11/xorg.conf?
2008-11-08T15:18:00.000Z	itson	ziroday	, i think there is something wrong because when i delete /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2008-11-08T15:19:00.000Z	ziroday	itson	hmm, what settings are you trying to change?
2008-11-08T15:20:00.000Z	ziroday	itson	okay, you can change that in your /etc/X11/xorg.conf by going to the Section "Device" and changing Driver "whatever" to Driver "vesa"
2008-11-08T15:21:00.000Z	itson	ziroday	but still, i have no mode or modes or whatever in there
2008-11-08T15:21:00.000Z	ziroday	itson	that is correct, it generates a minimal xorg.conf, you are free to add those lines in if you want
2008-11-08T15:23:00.000Z	itson	ziroday	when i try to change screen resolution though the GUI window in gnome, i have multiple options but those options dont show up in xorg.conf
2008-11-08T15:23:00.000Z	ziroday	itson	that is normal
2008-11-08T15:25:00.000Z	ziroday	itson	but that is very much due to you using ubuntu _inside_ parallels
2008-11-08T15:26:00.000Z	ziroday	itson	you are running ubuntu inside a parellel's virtualization software correct?
2008-11-08T15:27:00.000Z	ziroday	itson	right, and the reason you can't get the full resolution you need is probably due to the graphics driver inside the vm
2008-11-08T15:29:00.000Z	itson	ziroday	but it works really well on my windows XP virtual box.
