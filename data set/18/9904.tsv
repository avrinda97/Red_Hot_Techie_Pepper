2007-02-08T10:21:00.000Z	piedoggie		so the question is phiqtion, are you smarter than me?  :-)
2007-02-08T10:22:00.000Z	piedoggie		I would suggest doing the install up to the point of installing the boot code.  If it doesn't do is you want, then back off until you can find what you need
2007-02-08T10:23:00.000Z	piedoggie		as for the TTY message, that must be happening really early in the boot process
2007-02-08T10:23:00.000Z	piedoggie		I would suspect a problem with init
2007-02-08T10:23:00.000Z	piedoggie		which is definitely a reinstall time
2007-02-08T10:23:00.000Z	piedoggie		which distribution are you trying to install?
2007-02-08T10:24:00.000Z	piedoggie		that goes in slick as iced s***  on most of my machines (except for my Compaq laptop)
2007-02-08T10:24:00.000Z	piedoggie		here's another potential solution for you
2007-02-08T10:25:00.000Z	piedoggie		I run XP because I'm disabled and need to use speech recognition
2007-02-08T10:25:00.000Z	piedoggie		I run Linux as a virtual machine on top of XP
2007-02-08T10:25:00.000Z	cables	piedoggie	do you use Dragon? Dragon's great. I wish they'd come out with a Linux version.
2007-02-08T10:26:00.000Z	cables	piedoggie	that's not why... it's because the VM doesn't look like a text box, it looks like an image. So the recognizer can't work with it.
2007-02-08T10:26:00.000Z	cables	piedoggie	Nuance and MIcrosoft don't have any secred deals to keep it from working in VM
2007-02-08T10:27:00.000Z	piedoggie	cables	true, there are no secret deals.  It's only that nuance is firetrucking incompetent
2007-02-08T10:28:00.000Z	cables	piedoggie	they're not. It's not possible for them to work in a VM because a VM is a big image. No textbox, no input.
2007-02-08T10:28:00.000Z	cables	piedoggie	that would be good. But don't blame Nuance for this.
2007-02-08T10:30:00.000Z	piedoggie	cables	the image aspect of the display has nothing to do with it.  It's how keystrokes are injected into the system and communicated to the application.  Naturally speaking injects at a fairly low level but apparently VM Ware connects underneath that
2007-02-08T10:31:00.000Z	cables	piedoggie	when I think about it, I guess you're right...
