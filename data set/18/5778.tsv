2009-07-15T13:35:00.000Z	fwaokda_		I finally got my restricted drivers for my display to cooperate... only thing left is my main display in display properties doesn't show it's max resolution of 1920(?)x1080... anyone have any ideas on how i can fix this? I am using dual monitors btw and the second monitor has a resolution of 1680x1050 (which is what they are both currently set at) ???
2009-07-15T13:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	fwaokda_	you can use xorg.conf to specify weird resolutions
2009-07-15T13:37:00.000Z	fwaokda_	ActionParsnip1	is there a howto somewhere that will explain to me how to edit it?
2009-07-15T13:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	fwaokda_	if you search round the web you can find example files

2009-07-15T13:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	fwaokda_	here's mine: http://pastebin.com/f16fa7b2f
2009-07-15T13:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	fwaokda_	i need to specify a lot in mine as I use an old CRT monitor
2009-07-15T13:38:00.000Z	fwaokda_	ActionParsnip1	ahh ok
2009-07-15T13:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	fwaokda_	so i have to specify refresh rates etc so I can get a full display
2009-07-15T13:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	fwaokda_	as my monitor doesnt talk back to my video card when its asked
2009-07-15T13:49:00.000Z	fwaokda_	ActionParsnip1	here is my xorg.conf file... I don't see where to put my resolution though -- http://pastebin.com/m4c48e25f -- I thought perhaps I just need to change the virtual resolution thats there but what would be the virtual resolution for 1920x1080 & 1650x1050 ?
2009-07-15T13:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	fwaokda_	line 34 in that pastebin, if you look at mine you can compare
2009-07-15T13:51:00.000Z	fwaokda_	ActionParsnip1	you don't have a part in yours labeled, "Viewport" that i see
2009-07-15T13:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	fwaokda_	its not that EXACT line, its just in that subsection
2009-07-15T13:52:00.000Z	fwaokda_	ActionParsnip1	your subsection only has "Depth 24" in it...
2009-07-15T13:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip1	fwaokda_	ok here's a better one: http://www.avsforum.com/avs-vb/archive/index.php/t-847670.html
