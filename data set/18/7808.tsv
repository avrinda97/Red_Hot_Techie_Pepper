2008-06-21T02:53:00.000Z	tommy_		I am safe and can have peace of mind using Ubuntu for my netbanking etc as there is no keylogger or spyware that I need to worry about?
2008-06-21T02:54:00.000Z	tommy_		!keylogger
2008-06-21T02:54:00.000Z	tommy_		!spyware
2008-06-21T02:54:00.000Z	tommy_		does Hardy support digital cameras?
2008-06-21T02:55:00.000Z	Oli```	tommy_	you're far less likely to install one unknowingly. Anybody could write a keylogger. Linux won't stop something like that existing
2008-06-21T02:55:00.000Z	tommy_	Oli```	so how can I make sure I dont have one installed now?
2008-06-21T02:56:00.000Z	tommy_	Oli```	u there?
2008-06-21T02:56:00.000Z	Oli```	tommy_	there are commercial and free antivirus programs (avg, for example) just like with windows but not running/installing anything from outside the repos is a good start
2008-06-21T02:57:00.000Z	tommy_	Oli```	so I should run AVG on Ubuntu to make sure I dnt have a keylogger installed on Hardy?
2008-06-21T02:58:00.000Z	Oli```	tommy_	I'm not telling you that. I'm saying you *can* use an antivirus to check now but unless you're planning on downloading random untrusted source code or binaries and running those, you should be fine
2008-06-21T02:59:00.000Z	tommy_	Oli```	I have installed 2 3rd party apps, how can I check they are ok?
2008-06-21T02:59:00.000Z	Oli```	tommy_	btw, the same goes for Windows. Keep the system patched and updated and you'll be fine 99.999% of the time.
2008-06-21T02:59:00.000Z	tommy_	Oli```	are you claiming that MS windows updates clean spyware and virus?
2008-06-21T03:00:00.000Z	Oli```	tommy_	No. Not installing malware kind of goes without saying.
2008-06-21T03:00:00.000Z	tommy_	Oli```	I cant use Hardy confidently?
2008-06-21T03:01:00.000Z	Oli```	tommy_	I believe you're being deliberately abrasive now. Unless you're here for actual support (giving or receiving), please clear off.
2008-06-21T03:02:00.000Z	tommy_	Oli```	thou shalt not judge because your assuming to know my intentions.
2008-06-21T03:02:00.000Z	tommy_	Oli```	you are now on ignore
