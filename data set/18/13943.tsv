2005-12-06T08:54:00.000Z	Toma-	DShepherd	why from source?
2005-12-06T08:54:00.000Z	DShepherd	Toma-	 I want firefox 1.5 :)
2005-12-06T08:55:00.000Z	Toma-	DShepherd	no need to build anything from source.

2006-01-02T08:41:00.000Z	Toma-	DShepherd	u still here?
2006-06-01T10:38:00.000Z	DShepherd	Toma-	as in #kubuntu
2007-05-17T10:07:00.000Z	Toma-	DShepherd	it give you 1000mhz timers
2007-05-17T10:07:00.000Z	DShepherd	Toma-	not sure what you mean..
2007-05-17T10:08:00.000Z	Toma-	DShepherd	well you probably dont need it then :)
2007-05-17T10:08:00.000Z	DShepherd	Toma-	ok :-) kool
2007-05-17T10:09:00.000Z	Toma-	DShepherd	its mainly for audio work and things that need to run at close to realtime. no advantage over -generic for desktop use
2007-05-17T10:09:00.000Z	DShepherd	Toma-	kool.. thanks for the heads up
2007-05-17T10:11:00.000Z	DShepherd	Toma-	since we are talking about kernels.. how different is the generic kernel from the 386 kernel? I usually install the 386 kernel..
2007-05-17T10:12:00.000Z	Toma-	DShepherd	the major difference is that -generic is compiled for 586 cpus and has SMP support, -386 is compiled for 486 machines and has no smp support
2007-05-17T10:13:00.000Z	DShepherd	Toma-	hmm.. ok thanks the information again
2007-05-17T10:13:00.000Z	Toma-	DShepherd	no problem
