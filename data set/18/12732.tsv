2006-03-15T09:11:00.000Z	eth0		what's realbasic
2006-03-15T09:13:00.000Z	eth0		alright, thanks :)
2006-03-15T09:13:00.000Z	eth0		carin: yeah
2006-03-15T09:14:00.000Z	aleph0	eth0	bash is not a good place to start IMHO. and neither is c. to start learning programming first take a look at something like python or something. it's quick to learn, easier thatn c and it's teach you all the basic concepts without having to worry too much about pointers and stuff
2006-03-15T09:16:00.000Z	eth0	aleph0	yeah, i've heard  that b4 that it's not the best one to start with, but are pointers really that complicated?
2006-03-15T09:17:00.000Z	eth0		aldren: i've not used them that much
2006-03-15T09:17:00.000Z	eth0		er
2006-03-15T09:17:00.000Z	eth0	aleph0	i've not used them that much
2006-03-15T09:17:00.000Z	aleph0	eth0	they're not impossible to learn, but it's be more fun if you start with something that you can get going with straight away... with c it'l take you longer to have fun ;-)
2006-03-15T09:19:00.000Z	eth0	aleph0	yeah, good point
2006-03-15T09:19:00.000Z	eth0	aleph0	but are pointers tricky?
2006-03-15T09:20:00.000Z	eth0	aleph0	oh sorry
2006-03-15T09:20:00.000Z	eth0	aleph0	i misread what u last said
2006-03-15T09:20:00.000Z	eth0	aleph0	but are pointers tricky?  <---- ignore that
2006-03-15T09:20:00.000Z	aleph0	eth0	they're not tricky, they're annoying ;-)
2006-03-15T09:21:00.000Z	eth0	aleph0	yeah i don't totaly understand the point of them so far
2006-03-15T09:23:00.000Z	eth0	aleph0	except with bash, learning all the unix commands and kinda makes things a lot easier tho, no? cuz the shell does all the work for you?
2006-03-15T09:24:00.000Z	eth0	aleph0	or am i looking for a book on linux, rather than bash?
