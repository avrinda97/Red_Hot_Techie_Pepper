2009-07-14T08:50:00.000Z	ecret		I have scripts that I want to be able to run as if they were in /bin.  I set the $path=$path:/other/path              but when I try to run the scripts , I cannot access them from every directory as I had hoped to.
2009-07-14T08:50:00.000Z	prince_jammys	ecret	the variable is PATH, all caps. set it in your .profile
2009-07-14T08:52:00.000Z	prince_jammys	ecret	where do you have that?
2009-07-14T08:52:00.000Z	ecret	prince_jammys	i type it each time. I just need it sometimes.
2009-07-14T08:53:00.000Z	prince_jammys	ecret	if you don't mind always having /other/path in your PATH, put that in your ~/.profile
2009-07-14T08:53:00.000Z	prince_jammys	ecret	otherwise it will only be in your PATH in shells that are children of the one where you typed it.
2009-07-14T08:54:00.000Z	ecret	prince_jammys	yes.  I will add to profile but right now I see it when I echo $PATH.  Should I be able to ./shellscript or sh shellscript from any folder?
2009-07-14T08:55:00.000Z	prince_jammys	ecret	once its in your PATH, you simply type 'shellscript' from anywhere
2009-07-14T08:55:00.000Z	prince_jammys	ecret	provided your scripts have shebangs (eg #!/bin/bash), which they should.
2009-07-14T09:00:00.000Z	prince_jammys	ecret	you're catching side traffic for other people whose nicks start with 'e' ;)
2009-07-14T09:01:00.000Z	ecret	prince_jammys	he he .  well im sure theres a .0001% that theire random suggestion is right :)
2009-07-14T09:02:00.000Z	prince_jammys	ecret	your PATH issue is sorted out?
2009-07-14T09:02:00.000Z	ecret	prince_jammys	not yet.  I can't get it to let me access .sh' from other paths
2009-07-14T09:03:00.000Z	prince_jammys	ecret	when you open a terminal and 'echo "$PATH"', does it show up properly?
2009-07-14T09:04:00.000Z	ecret	prince_jammys	yjep. even ccopy pasted to make sure its typed right
2009-07-14T09:04:00.000Z	prince_jammys	ecret	so when you type 'shellscript' or whatever it's called, what happens?
2009-07-14T09:06:00.000Z	ecret	prince_jammys	egg on my face. when I checked the path again it was wrong.
2009-07-14T09:06:00.000Z	ecret	prince_jammys	thanks for the tip :<
