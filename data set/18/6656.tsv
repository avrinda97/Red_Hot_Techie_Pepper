2010-01-21T00:00:00.000Z	Anusien		CTRL-ALT-F1 does nothing
2010-01-21T00:02:00.000Z	powertoo108	Anusien	You can force a safe restart with ctrl+alt+print screen + R + E + I + S + U + B, the reisub part doesn't have to be held down all at once, just one after another in that order.
2010-01-21T00:03:00.000Z	Anusien	powertoo108	I still hear the disk spinning up and occasionally spinning down. Should I just give it some hours until it finishes?
2010-01-21T00:04:00.000Z	powertoo108	Anusien	That command series should immediately reboot it, no waiting involved.
2010-01-21T00:05:00.000Z	powertoo108	Anusien	Just looked it up, the ctrl key isn't needed just hold alt+print screen the entire time, then reisub one at a time in order
2010-01-21T00:06:00.000Z	powertoo108	Anusien	reisuo will shutdown instead of restarting it.
2010-01-21T00:06:00.000Z	powertoo108	Anusien	If that doesn't work, you probably have to do a hard reset.
2010-01-21T00:06:00.000Z	Anusien	powertoo108	Just wondering if I should do it or let it finish, and what will break if I reboot during this
2010-01-21T00:07:00.000Z	powertoo108	Anusien	It shouldn't break anything, but it will kill all running processes.

2010-01-21T00:10:00.000Z	powertoo108	Anusien	Well I guess wait as long as you're willing to wait. But this method should fix it. I've only had one instance when the REISUB combo didn't work for me.
2010-01-21T00:11:00.000Z	Anusien	powertoo108	... what was that instance?
2010-01-21T00:11:00.000Z	powertoo108	Anusien	"fix it" bad choice of words, it should restart, despite how frozen it seems, and yes, all hard drive data is safe since its shutdown in a proper way.
2010-01-21T00:13:00.000Z	powertoo108	Anusien	I don't really remember the specifics. But nothing responded, no ssh, ctrl+alt+f1 didn't work, no clicks on the drive, couldn't even open the cd drives.
2010-01-21T00:20:00.000Z	powertoo108	Anusien	If I were in your situation, I'd REISUB it, then see what's broken after the restart. If its pretty messed up, I'd grab the install cd and reinstall. Note: I have /home as its own partition so reinstalling is fast and I don't lose any /home data. Anyway, I've got to go now. Good luck with it.
2010-01-21T00:20:00.000Z	Anusien	powertoo108	I don't know if I was that smart
2010-01-21T00:20:00.000Z	Anusien	powertoo108	but the livecd should let me mount the drive and back up if I have to
2010-01-21T00:22:00.000Z	powertoo108	Anusien	Well, worse case scenario, your system is trashed, you have to use a live cd to backup /home to an external or something, then reinstall, giving /home its own partition, then move files from your backup. It would be a pain, but its a fixable situation without worries of data loss imo. Yes, you shouldn't have any problems mounting the drives.
