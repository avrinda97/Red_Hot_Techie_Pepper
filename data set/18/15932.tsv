2005-01-13T12:44:00.000Z	HaloGray		My last distro was Arch.  I used it to learn as much as I could about linux without pulling my brain out of my head and eating it
2005-01-13T12:44:00.000Z	HaloGray		Ubuntu
2005-01-13T12:44:00.000Z	HaloGray		Warty is .7 isn't it?
2005-01-13T12:45:00.000Z	HaloGray		I must be thinking of something else then.
2005-01-13T12:45:00.000Z	HaloGray		Nevermind :O
2005-01-13T12:45:00.000Z	HaloGray		One thing I do notice about running in linux for a short time
2005-01-13T12:45:00.000Z	HaloGray		my laptop gets about as hot as windows + games
2005-01-13T12:46:00.000Z	HaloGray		I'm wondering if my video driver isn't being detected properly
2005-01-13T12:46:00.000Z	HaloGray		This is a laptop, so it's the mobility card
2005-01-13T12:46:00.000Z	HaloGray		if it's detecting the desktop card... could it be soft modding the card and heating it up?
2005-01-13T12:46:00.000Z	tsw	HaloGray	check that acpi is running, it controls fans also
2005-01-13T12:49:00.000Z	tsw	HaloGray	but it seems that acpi is running
2005-01-13T12:50:00.000Z	tsw	HaloGray	you can also get info with more /proc/acpi/*
2005-01-13T12:54:00.000Z	tsw	HaloGray	what about settings in bios?
2005-01-13T12:57:00.000Z	tsw	HaloGray	/var/log/XF86.log.0 or something like that has everything that X uses
2005-01-13T12:59:00.000Z	tsw	HaloGray	couldnt remeber and too lazy to check :)
2005-01-13T13:02:00.000Z	tsw	HaloGray	it could be that it doesnt have proper acceleration yet
2005-01-13T13:03:00.000Z	tsw	HaloGray	maybe you could call dells support to ask for linux drivers :D
