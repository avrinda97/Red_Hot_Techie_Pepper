2006-10-09T09:02:00.000Z	micky2		i am trying to install this multiverse package: http://packages.ubuntu.com/dapper/libs/libmotif3 . I have enabled the multiverse packages in adapt but when I type in "libmotif3" in adept's search box, no hits are found. If I try it manually "apt-get install libmotif3" it also doesnt work: " E: Couldn't find package libmotif3". Could someone help me out?
2006-10-09T09:03:00.000Z	dbingham	micky2	have you done "sudo apt-get update"?
2006-10-09T09:04:00.000Z	micky2	dbingham	yes thats the first thing i did
2006-10-09T09:05:00.000Z	dbingham	micky2	the other thing that comes to mind is that sometimes the package name isn't what you'd expect.  Try "apt-cache search libmotif3" and see if anything looks relevant.
2006-10-09T09:05:00.000Z	micky2	dbingham	ok trying now
2006-10-09T09:05:00.000Z	micky2	dbingham	no hits :(
2006-10-09T09:05:00.000Z	dbingham	micky2	the last part of the "apt-cache search _______" is actually a regular expression, so if you still can't find it, you might be able to get creative with your search and pull something out.
2006-10-09T09:07:00.000Z	dbingham	micky2	other than that, I'm not sure what to tell you.  If you can find the package online, you can try to just download it and install it manually with dpkg.
2006-10-09T09:07:00.000Z	micky2	dbingham	nada nothing ... surely if its shown here http://packages.ubuntu.com/dapper/libs/libmotif3 it should appear under apt?
2006-10-09T09:07:00.000Z	micky2	dbingham	yeah i think i will need to do it manuall
2006-10-09T09:07:00.000Z	micky2	dbingham	*manually
2006-10-09T09:08:00.000Z	dbingham	micky2	sometimes thats faster than trying to muck around with apt.  =)
2006-10-09T09:08:00.000Z	dbingham		I am trying to do X11 forwarding using my ubuntu install as the server, but when I ssh in with ssh -Y, the DISPLAY variable isn't being set.  I do have 'X11Forwarding yes' in my sshd_config.  Any ideas what might be wrong?
2006-10-09T09:08:00.000Z	micky2	dbingham	ok thanks for the help
2006-10-09T09:08:00.000Z	dbingham	micky2	sure
