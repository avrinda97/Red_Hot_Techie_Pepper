2010-07-04T05:43:00.000Z	Name141		Does the ATi driver for the 4670 come with 3D support?
2010-07-04T05:44:00.000Z	daskrEEch	Name141	depends on which driver
2010-07-04T05:44:00.000Z	Name141	daskrEEch	I am assuming the one that comes with Ubuntu.
2010-07-04T05:44:00.000Z	Name141	daskrEEch	From the repos
2010-07-04T05:45:00.000Z	daskrEEch	Name141	There are two in the repos
2010-07-04T05:45:00.000Z	Name141	daskrEEch	Does either of them support 3D?
2010-07-04T05:45:00.000Z	daskrEEch	Name141	Both support 3D only one with the 4670
2010-07-04T05:46:00.000Z	Name141	daskrEEch	OK.  Should I even bother trying steam and games ?
2010-07-04T05:46:00.000Z	Name141	daskrEEch	under wine
2010-07-04T05:46:00.000Z	daskrEEch	Name141	Pop into #winehq and ask them
2010-07-04T05:47:00.000Z	Name141	daskrEEch	Any idea on what "DirectX" it'd support? 9? 10.1? 11?
2010-07-04T05:48:00.000Z	daskrEEch	Name141	11
2010-07-04T05:48:00.000Z	Name141	daskrEEch	I see. My card only support 10.1 though
2010-07-04T05:48:00.000Z	daskrEEch	Name141	10.1 then :-)
2010-07-04T05:49:00.000Z	Name141	daskrEEch	I thought about the 5670, since it only draws a little more power.  But I guess that'd be more like ##hardware
2010-07-04T05:49:00.000Z	daskrEEch	Name141	#phoronix
2010-07-04T06:05:00.000Z	Name141	daskrEEch	Maybe to test things out:  I can setup Ubuntu aside from my XP, then run steam under wine without installing it directly on the ubuntu partition, just to see how things would work out?
2010-07-04T06:05:00.000Z	Name141	daskrEEch	Or maybe Wubi?
