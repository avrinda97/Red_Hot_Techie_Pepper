2007-05-18T11:45:00.000Z	Toma-	Angel	with your level of experience, you might want to stick to a simple system like ubuntu. you can always run sabayon from qemu within Ubuntu
2007-05-18T11:45:00.000Z	Toma-	Angel	if you dont like ubuntu, you can install sabayon :)
2007-05-18T11:47:00.000Z	Toma-	Angel	well use ubuntu. it will install and configure itself. as for ubuntustudio, you can install that ontop of ubuntu
2007-05-18T11:49:00.000Z	Toma-	Angel	yes. the ubuntu installer will setup dual booting for you
2007-05-18T11:49:00.000Z	Toma-	Angel	windows first, then ubuntu.
2007-05-18T11:49:00.000Z	Toma-	Angel	better yet, you could make a partition for ubuntu, windows AND sabayon, and run them all
2007-05-18T11:50:00.000Z	Toma-	Angel	sure.
2007-05-18T11:50:00.000Z	Toma-	Angel	you can have as many Linux versions as you like booting, provided you set up the partitions correctly
