2006-04-17T10:04:00.000Z	orbin	tanuki_	yeah, that made it clearer :-/
2006-04-17T10:04:00.000Z	orbin	tanuki_	what's the exact issue? not the right res.? not the right refresh rate?
2006-04-17T10:07:00.000Z	orbin	tanuki_	don't do that
2006-04-17T10:07:00.000Z	tanuki_	orbin	dont do what?
2006-04-17T10:08:00.000Z	orbin	tanuki_	you should enter the right rates for your monitor
2006-04-17T10:09:00.000Z	tanuki_	orbin	i do not know the correct rate, however 75 mhz should work for the vert max
2006-04-17T10:11:00.000Z	orbin	tanuki_	look at the fixres wiki page gnomefreak gave you.  you need to enter two ranges.  one for horizontal sync and one for vertical refresh.  both of these factor in to the final refresh rate you get
2006-04-17T10:12:00.000Z	orbin	tanuki_	by enter the ranges, i mean open up /etc/X11/xorg.conf and edit the Monitor section
2006-04-17T10:12:00.000Z	tanuki_	orbin	vertrefresh and horizsync, correct? are they case sensetive?
2006-04-17T10:14:00.000Z	orbin	tanuki_	yeah, get the case right.  correct format is in the wiki page
2006-04-17T10:14:00.000Z	tanuki_	orbin	actually that wiki page would not come up for me, can you tell me please?
2006-04-17T10:15:00.000Z	orbin	tanuki_	HorizSync          30-96
2006-04-17T10:15:00.000Z	orbin	tanuki_	those are only example range values.
2006-04-17T10:15:00.000Z	orbin	tanuki_	look, just pastebin /etc/X11/xorg.conf
