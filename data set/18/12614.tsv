2006-06-14T12:42:00.000Z	Matthewv	bliss_	maybe try a 'sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg'
2006-06-14T12:42:00.000Z	bliss_		Matthew: umm maybe? are we guessing
2006-06-14T12:45:00.000Z	Matthewv	bliss_	that will install x, i'm just not sure if it will fix ur problem, have you checked to see if 'startx' works?
