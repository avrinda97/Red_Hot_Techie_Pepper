2005-04-21T11:07:00.000Z	Coily		how 'safe' is it to resize an ext3 partition with (what i assume i should use) parted?
2005-04-21T11:07:00.000Z	Coily		anyone?
2005-04-21T11:08:00.000Z	michael_	Coily	i found I had to remove ext3's journal then readd it. Not too sure of the command, but google it to find out
2005-04-21T11:08:00.000Z	Coily	michael_	alright thanks
2005-04-21T11:09:00.000Z	michael_	Coily	no problem
2005-04-21T11:40:00.000Z	michael_	Coily	download a livecd that has qtparted on it... one great tool that has a lot of partitioning software on it is the Ultimate Boot CD
2005-04-21T11:40:00.000Z	michael_	Coily	www.ultimatebootcd.com i think
2005-04-21T11:42:00.000Z	michael_	Coily	because the hard drive you want to partion is mounted.... you could cause huge filesystem errors
2005-04-21T11:44:00.000Z	michael_	Coily	nah, just the partition
2005-04-21T11:45:00.000Z	michael_	Coily	but to be safe don't have ubuntu running, use a livecd
2005-04-21T11:47:00.000Z	michael_	Coily	find empty space on the diagram, right click, and create a new partition
2005-04-21T11:47:00.000Z	michael_	Coily	delete/resize a partition to make room if needed
2005-04-21T11:48:00.000Z	Coily	michael_	thanks. i noticed there are some .03mb free partitions as well as the main block of free space, any idea what they are?
2005-04-21T11:50:00.000Z	michael_	Coily	is there a partition present there or not?
2005-04-21T11:58:00.000Z	michael_	Coily	yes
2005-04-21T11:59:00.000Z	Coily	michael_	thanks again
2005-04-21T11:59:00.000Z	michael_	Coily	the extended partition is an "umbrella" for logical partitions
2005-04-21T12:00:00.000Z	michael_	Coily	the primary partition is the bootable partition
