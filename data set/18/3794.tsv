2009-07-30T13:18:00.000Z	WeblionX	screamsayonara	The card or antenna may have come lose.  Does Ubuntu notice you have a wireless network card?
2009-07-30T13:19:00.000Z	screamsayonara	WeblionX	how can i check that?
2009-07-30T13:19:00.000Z	WeblionX	screamsayonara	Well, does the network icon that shows wireless status show bars still?
2009-07-30T13:20:00.000Z	WeblionX	screamsayonara	You can add the wireless network?
2009-07-30T13:47:00.000Z	WeblionX	screamsayonara	Yes, it's inside.
2009-07-30T13:47:00.000Z	WeblionX	screamsayonara	Your antenna might have come loose.
2009-07-30T13:47:00.000Z	WeblionX	screamsayonara	Or your card may have been damaged.
2009-07-30T13:49:00.000Z	WeblionX	screamsayonara	Not really.  You can try 'iwconfig' to make sure it's recognized as a wireless card.
2009-07-30T13:50:00.000Z	WeblionX	screamsayonara	You might have accidentally disabled the card, but I'm not sure where that would be done.
