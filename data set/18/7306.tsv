2012-03-16T16:14:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aRaaa	i'd ask in #winehq
2012-03-16T16:15:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aRaaa	what OS versions did you try in winecfg?
2012-03-16T16:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aRaaa	in the winecfg app you can set the app to see the version of windows as Win2000, Win XP and so on. What have you tried?
2012-03-16T16:17:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aRaaa	at least one of the guides MUST have mentioned it.....
2012-03-16T16:18:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aRaaa	then try others]
2012-03-16T16:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aRaaa	try a few windows versions, see which makes it ok
2012-03-16T16:19:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aRaaa	did you check the appdb or not?
2012-03-16T16:20:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aRaaa	ok, now try the app. If its no good, try one of the other Windows versions
2012-03-16T16:21:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aRaaa	check the app can be made to run using the appdb, there will be a small guide too
2012-03-16T16:26:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aRaaa	thats fine, the appdb may help. Also try running the game from the terminal, it may help
2012-03-19T18:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	aRaaa	linux is the kernel, the thing around it is the distribution
