2010-10-31T12:12:00.000Z	orl		Hello!
2010-10-31T12:12:00.000Z	orl		Could someone give me the channel for Ubuntu with Mac Intel
2010-10-31T12:12:00.000Z	orl		I just can't get the system booting.
2010-10-31T12:14:00.000Z	Gnea	orl	have you read the URL that ubottu mentioned?
2010-10-31T12:14:00.000Z	orl	Gnea	yes
2010-10-31T12:14:00.000Z	orl	Gnea	I've been reading this through and through
2010-10-31T12:15:00.000Z	Gnea	orl	k, so you've determined that 10.04 will, indeed, work on your mac?
2010-10-31T12:15:00.000Z	orl	Gnea	yes.
2010-10-31T12:16:00.000Z	Gnea	orl	alright, and you've checked the support forums?
2010-10-31T12:16:00.000Z	orl	Gnea	several times, but didn't post anything myself.
2010-10-31T12:16:00.000Z	orl	Gnea	actually, there are two things weird: 1. I cannot set /dev/sda5 (/) as bootable in gparted. 2. I remember about something like EFI needs the partition to be one of the four first to be bootable, am I wrong?
2010-10-31T12:16:00.000Z	Gnea	orl	okay, I suggest this then: make a post there, be as detailed as you can possibly get, then once you've done that, post the URL here
2010-10-31T12:17:00.000Z	orl	Gnea	OK, yes.
2010-10-31T12:17:00.000Z	Gnea	orl	I don't own a mac and haven't done this, so I can't say for sure.
2010-10-31T12:17:00.000Z	Gnea	orl	there are some mac people around, but they might be asleep at the moment
2010-10-31T12:19:00.000Z	orl	Gnea	OK, thanks. I thought there were a specific Mac Ubuntu channel (remember to have using it several years ago, but it was perhaps Debian's one)
2010-10-31T12:20:00.000Z	Gnea	orl	you might have been thinking about the #debian-ppc channel, back when macs used PowerPC
2010-10-31T12:23:00.000Z	orl	Gnea	that's true, I was installing both MacIntel and PowerMac by that time.
