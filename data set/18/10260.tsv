2007-03-04T13:26:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Taime1	why not just use Firefox?
2007-03-04T13:26:00.000Z	Taime1	IndyGunFreak	firefox doesnt work for all sites
2007-03-04T13:27:00.000Z	Taime1	IndyGunFreak	one in particular only opens in konqueror
2007-03-04T13:27:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Taime1	hmm, show me a site that doesn't work.. cuz i've had no issues with it.
2007-03-04T13:28:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Taime1	maybe try Opera, i don't know.. but if you have 1.5 or above, it offers you a plugin
2007-03-04T13:29:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Taime1	what about ie4linux or something like that?
2007-03-04T13:29:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Taime1	its a conspiracy...
2007-03-04T13:30:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Taime1	first we assasinated kennedy, then we made sure you couldn't use plugins in Konq
2007-03-04T13:30:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Taime1	seriously though...  id ont' know muca bout Konq, thus why im directing you other directions..
2007-03-04T13:31:00.000Z	IndyGunFreak	Taime1	if its MS compatible, probably..lol, but i've never used it
