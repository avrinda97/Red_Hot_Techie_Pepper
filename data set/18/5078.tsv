2009-11-01T18:22:00.000Z	raven_		what was the way to start a gui on a server using ssh?
2009-11-01T18:22:00.000Z	kevdog	raven_	You mean tunneling the X connection?
2009-11-01T18:23:00.000Z	raven_	kevdog	right
2009-11-01T18:23:00.000Z	kevdog	raven_	ssh -X .......
2009-11-01T18:23:00.000Z	raven_	kevdog	ok tnx
2009-11-01T18:23:00.000Z	kevdog	raven_	Do you have the xauth package installed on the server as well?
2009-11-01T18:24:00.000Z	raven_	kevdog	think so
2009-11-01T18:24:00.000Z	raven_		yes
2009-11-01T18:24:00.000Z	kevdog	raven_	Just make you sure do!!!
2009-11-01T18:25:00.000Z	raven_	kevdog	yes its working
2009-11-01T18:25:00.000Z	kevdog		What's the best way to install enlightenment on karmic?
2009-11-01T18:29:00.000Z	kevdog		NO one is using Enlightenment?
2009-11-01T18:33:00.000Z	raven_	kevdog	is possible to tunnel files trough ssh for example to convert a local file using ffmpeg on the server without copying to a netdrive?
2009-11-01T18:34:00.000Z	kevdog	raven_	You mean copy the file to the server?
2009-11-01T18:35:00.000Z	raven_	kevdog	yes but without copying the file before the command but to copy it while converting
2009-11-01T18:36:00.000Z	kevdog	raven_	You mean copy the result file (during the conversion) to the other machine?
2009-11-01T18:36:00.000Z	kevdog	raven_	I think the best way to do this would be to mount the remote driver as a local drive -- which would require nfs, cifs, or samba.
2009-11-01T18:37:00.000Z	raven_	kevdog	right - tunneling the recource file to the server and the result to the client during the ffmpeg command
