2008-07-05T01:31:00.000Z	TimMatrix		How do I tell whether my Hardy Heron version is 8.04 or 8.04.1?
2008-07-05T01:33:00.000Z	TimMatrix		How do I tell whether my Hardy Heron version is 8.04 or 8.04.1?
2008-07-05T01:34:00.000Z	TimMatrix		I tried to look it up using System Monitor, but it shows 8.04.   Is this sufficient, or is there a terminal version that tells you the precise release number?
2008-07-05T01:36:00.000Z	bloodrock	TimMatrix	you could look in /boot/grub/menu.lst
2008-07-05T01:37:00.000Z	TimMatrix	bloodrock	Hmmm, it only shows 8.04, not the latest 8.04.1
2008-07-05T01:39:00.000Z	bloodrock	TimMatrix	do you have auto update set
2008-07-05T01:42:00.000Z	bloodrock	TimMatrix	what you could do is open system.admin.update manager click on check if it shows no updates
2008-07-05T01:43:00.000Z	bloodrock	TimMatrix	 you should have been auto updated to 8.04.1 then been sending updates this month like chickens with hjeads cut off lol
2008-07-05T01:44:00.000Z	bloodrock	TimMatrix	they also released a iso of 8.04.1 on distrowatch.com
2008-07-05T01:45:00.000Z	TimMatrix	bloodrock	I always update it as and when it becomes available.  THing is that when I look up System Monitor, it shows 8.04, and my email from Ubuntu says the latest is 8.04.1, which is why I was puzzled.  But I am glad that ariel has solved my question.
2008-07-05T01:45:00.000Z	TimMatrix	bloodrock	I agree, but why download 700Mb, when I can get it upgraded via Synaptic Manager>?
2008-07-05T01:47:00.000Z	bloodrock	TimMatrix	was just telling in case ya didnt know i'm slow lol
2008-07-05T01:48:00.000Z	TimMatrix	bloodrock	lol, no worries, thanks for the help.
2008-07-05T01:48:00.000Z	bloodrock	TimMatrix	i tried out the 8.10 it's a mess lol
2008-07-05T01:49:00.000Z	TimMatrix	bloodrock	It's supposed to be released in October
2008-07-05T01:49:00.000Z	TimMatrix	bloodrock	Yeah, but surely you meant 7.10?
2008-07-05T01:49:00.000Z	bloodrock	TimMatrix	 no 8.10
2008-07-05T01:53:00.000Z	TimMatrix	bloodrock	Okay, but I wouldn't try 8.10 as it'd be highly experimental at this stage.  Granted that it does have the stability of 8.04, but some experimental system programs or the like in this 8.10 version aren't fully tested, hence the term "development".
