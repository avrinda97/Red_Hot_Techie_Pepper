2006-04-18T12:36:00.000Z	Agent_bob		you could just remove hotplug from that system
2006-04-18T12:38:00.000Z	njan	Agent_bob	I'm sure there's an analogy for that. Something about heavy weaponry and small insects. :P
2006-04-18T12:38:00.000Z	Agent_bob	njan	"over kill" ?
2006-04-18T12:38:00.000Z	Agent_bob	njan	what ?
2006-04-18T12:39:00.000Z	njan	Agent_bob	removing hotplug in order to get a usb device working in vmware..
2006-04-18T12:39:00.000Z	Agent_bob	njan	k.     but makes sense to me.
2006-04-18T12:40:00.000Z	njan	Agent_bob	well, it would probably work, but you'd lose a vast amount of functionality..
2006-04-18T12:41:00.000Z	Agent_bob	njan	removing the module "hotplug" affects the system in the same way.   no ?
2006-04-18T12:42:00.000Z	njan	Agent_bob	stopping hotplug would remove the functionality until you either restarted the service or rebooted.
2006-04-18T12:42:00.000Z	njan	Agent_bob	removing it entirely would remove the functionality entirely.
2006-04-18T12:42:00.000Z	njan	Agent_bob	hotplug is a program which loads modules, not a module itself.
2006-04-18T12:43:00.000Z	Agent_bob	njan	glad you have an opinion.  enjoy.
2006-04-18T12:43:00.000Z	njan	Agent_bob	sorry, thought you might want to discuss a better solution and maybe learn something. *shrug*.. :)
2006-04-18T12:45:00.000Z	Agent_bob	njan	i understood it already.   and i'm an 'anti-auto' kinda guy,  so removing hotplug to stop that problem with vmware makes perfect sense.  i only mentioned that it was an option.  i didn't sujest that anyone do that.
2006-04-18T12:46:00.000Z	Agent_bob	njan	as to a "better way"  that is "opion"     and like i said glad you have one.   but yours and mine don't have to agree.
2006-04-18T12:47:00.000Z	njan	Agent_bob	I agree that we don't have to agree on it, but in terms of the best solution for someone who might not share your philosophy in OS behaviour, removing hotplug probably isn't the best solution, especially given that people using ubuntu generally like that sort of functionality.
2006-04-18T12:47:00.000Z	njan	Agent_bob	I'd be especially cautious of advising someone who may not understand the implications of the advice to do something like remove hotplug without any caveats or explanation as to what removing part of the OS might entail..
2006-04-18T12:50:00.000Z	njan	Agent_bob	this obviously isn't going anywhere, so I'm dropping it - ty for your time. ;)
