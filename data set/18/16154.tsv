2004-11-15T07:16:00.000Z	thoreauputic	nefertati	do you have an external modem?
2004-11-15T07:16:00.000Z	thoreauputic	nefertati	are you comfortable with commandline?
2004-11-15T07:17:00.000Z	thoreauputic	nefertati	do you have the nameservers and numbers for your isp?
2004-11-15T07:18:00.000Z	thoreauputic	nefertati	well, sudo pppconfig should walk you througha configuration; it isn't too hard
2004-11-15T07:19:00.000Z	thoreauputic	nefertati	in a terminal, sudo pppconfig   -and see how you go
2004-11-15T07:20:00.000Z	thoreauputic	nefertati	if you do, read man pppconfig as well
2004-11-15T07:20:00.000Z	thoreauputic	nefertati	although it is fairly straightforward
2004-11-15T07:21:00.000Z	thoreauputic	nefertati	no worries -come back if you have problems :)
2004-11-15T07:22:00.000Z	thoreauputic	nefertati	no need for apologies - we are all learning :)
2004-11-15T07:22:00.000Z	thoreauputic	nefertati	and you will learn much more, I'm sure
2004-11-16T08:11:00.000Z	thoreauputic	nefertati	do you want me to explain, or would you rather tell bob2 yourself?
