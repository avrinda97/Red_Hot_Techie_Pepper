2006-10-26T13:42:00.000Z	EmxBA		it's 32 bits, ma1
2006-10-26T13:43:00.000Z	EmxBA		are there any real speed-ups using amd 64 bit cpu with ubuntu 64 bit version?
2006-10-26T13:43:00.000Z	LjL	EmxBA	not very noticeable ones
2006-10-26T13:43:00.000Z	EmxBA	LjL	is it better to use 32bit or?
2006-10-26T13:43:00.000Z	LjL	EmxBA	it's easier, if you want to use stuff like Flash, Wine, the win32codecs, etc
2006-10-26T14:23:00.000Z	LjL	EmxBA	no
2006-10-26T14:24:00.000Z	EmxBA	LjL	OK
2006-11-14T10:38:00.000Z	LjL	EmxBA	it's just a codename, it means nothing,
2006-11-14T10:38:00.000Z	EmxBA	LjL	doesn't mean nothing? shouldn't that be "more creatively challenging work; cutting edge; "
2006-11-14T10:39:00.000Z	LjL	EmxBA	in the context of Ubuntu, it's just a codename.
2006-11-14T10:39:00.000Z	LjL	EmxBA	of course it means something in Edgy, but then that's offtopic here, you can ask a dictionary - as you've just done i guess
2006-11-14T10:40:00.000Z	LjL	EmxBA	ask a dictionary. in the context of Ubuntu, no, they're just words Shuttleworth chose.
2006-11-14T10:40:00.000Z	EmxBA	LjL	thanks for that too! :)
2006-11-14T10:46:00.000Z	EmxBA	LjL	what does GPM stand for? it should be GDM in your last reply :S
2006-11-14T10:46:00.000Z	LjL	EmxBA	no, i said GPM and meant it
2006-11-14T10:46:00.000Z	EmxBA	LjL	ok
2006-11-14T10:46:00.000Z	LjL	EmxBA	GPM is the program you just installed to use the mouse in VTs
2006-11-14T10:47:00.000Z	LjL	EmxBA	and you can find out what the acronym means by just typing "apt-cache show gpm"
