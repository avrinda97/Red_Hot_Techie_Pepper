2011-12-14T07:54:00.000Z	travisHAZE		That was how I got my first kill
2011-12-14T07:54:00.000Z	travisHAZE		I poked this one person to death with a stick
2011-12-14T07:54:00.000Z	travisHAZE		No
2011-12-14T07:54:00.000Z	travisHAZE		I was just poking him
2011-12-14T07:55:00.000Z	travisHAZE		Eventually he keeled over and died
2011-12-14T07:55:00.000Z	travisHAZE		So I kept poking
2011-12-14T07:55:00.000Z	travisHAZE		Cause I hadn't poked a dead body
2011-12-14T07:55:00.000Z	travisHAZE		Haze is the middle name ma momma gave me
2011-12-14T07:56:00.000Z	travisHAZE		pop3 leaves it on the server
2011-12-14T07:56:00.000Z	travisHAZE		And you download a copy
2011-12-14T07:56:00.000Z	SwedeMike	travisHAZE	that's up to the pop3 client.
2011-12-14T07:56:00.000Z	SwedeMike	travisHAZE	the client can delete it.

2011-12-14T08:00:00.000Z	SwedeMike	travisHAZE	neither IMAP nor POP3 has auto delete. it's always an action by the client.
2011-12-14T08:01:00.000Z	SwedeMike	travisHAZE	some might be, but that's not the standard.
2011-12-14T08:02:00.000Z	SwedeMike	travisHAZE	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Message_Access_Protocol "E-mail clients using IMAP generally leave messages on the server until the user explicitly deletes them. This and other characteristics of IMAP operation allow multiple clients to manage the same mailbox."
2011-12-14T08:03:00.000Z	SwedeMike	travisHAZE	there might be some default in there, but there is nothing in the protocol that says that.
2011-12-14T08:04:00.000Z	SwedeMike	travisHAZE	well, that might be your experience with the defaults in your specific clients you've tried, but there is nothing general by those protocols that says this is always the case.
