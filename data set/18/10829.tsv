2006-10-27T10:49:00.000Z	wiz		I need a bit of help getting ndiswrapper and my wifi going. The driver seems to be up and running ok, and iwlist wlan0 scanning detects the AP, but if I try to connect I get stuff like: received packet has bogus ESSID and it never gets dhcp, any help?
2006-10-27T10:49:00.000Z	sivik	wiz	did you enter a security key?
2006-10-27T10:49:00.000Z	wiz	sivik	I have the wep off for now, until I get it working
2006-10-27T10:50:00.000Z	wiz	sivik	any ideas?
2006-10-27T10:51:00.000Z	sivik	wiz	what was the problem again
2006-10-27T10:51:00.000Z	sivik	wiz	i'm doing way too many things at one
2006-10-27T10:51:00.000Z	wiz	sivik	I got ndiswrapper setup and it seems to be ok, but when I try to connect I get stuff in dmesg like: "received packet has bogus ESSID" and it won't dhcp
2006-10-27T10:52:00.000Z	sivik	wiz	my wireless card has worked once and then it quits working
2006-10-27T10:52:00.000Z	wiz	sivik	I'm a little far from the ap, but I get a full connection when in windows.
2006-10-27T10:52:00.000Z	sivik	wiz	what card?
2006-10-27T10:52:00.000Z	wiz	sivik	el cheapo airlink card, texas instr acx
2006-10-27T10:53:00.000Z	wiz	sivik	I've had it working with ndis before, but it's been a while and I don't remember if I had to do anything sepcial.
2006-10-27T10:53:00.000Z	sivik	wiz	i have broadcom and it worked until i did any package upgrading in dapper
2006-10-27T10:53:00.000Z	wiz	sivik	so I'm sol and stuck with windows?
2006-10-27T10:54:00.000Z	sivik	wiz	i have no clue, never used ndiswrapper, someone else might know
2006-10-27T10:58:00.000Z	wiz	sivik	would it make sense for the signal to be stronger in windows than linux, and not good enough for a connection in *nix?
2006-10-27T10:58:00.000Z	sivik	wiz	probably not
2006-10-27T10:58:00.000Z	wiz	sivik	that's what I figured
