2012-04-05T05:11:00.000Z	Tasmania		For any reason everytime I click on the text box for Irssi and type in "F" it doesn't type in the text box, but rather goes to the "Find" tab.
2012-04-05T05:11:00.000Z	hylian	Tasmania	did you type f3?
2012-04-05T05:12:00.000Z	Tasmania	hylian	it's doing the same thing.
2012-04-05T05:17:00.000Z	hylian	Tasmania	what search option? i don't see it?
2012-04-05T05:18:00.000Z	hylian	Tasmania	are you using a terminal emulator like gnome-terminal, or are you tty'ed in via control alt f1, for instance?
2012-04-05T05:19:00.000Z	hylian	Tasmania	is there a way we could get a screen shot of this?
2012-04-05T05:21:00.000Z	hylian	Tasmania	if you hit print screen, or prtsc on the top right of your keyboard, you should get an option for screenshot. or if you hear a camera shutter sound, it automatically saved it to /home/tasmania/Pictures/
2012-04-05T05:29:00.000Z	hylian	Tasmania	how is the screenshot coming along?
2012-04-05T05:30:00.000Z	hylian	Tasmania	good to hear it. :)
2012-04-05T05:50:00.000Z	hylian	Tasmania	what does it do?
