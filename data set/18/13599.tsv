2007-02-02T17:19:00.000Z	Cretemonster		small question about changing permissions on a folder?
2007-02-02T17:19:00.000Z	LjL	Cretemonster	yes?
2007-02-02T17:20:00.000Z	LjL	Cretemonster	yeah, but what's the question? :P
2007-02-02T17:20:00.000Z	LjL	Cretemonster	well, to begin with, if an application has done that, it might have had good reasons to do it, no?
2007-02-02T17:20:00.000Z	LjL	Cretemonster	what folder is that anyway?
2007-02-02T17:24:00.000Z	LjL	Cretemonster	yes, "sudo" is the command that allows you to work as root. if you need to change the *permissions* of a file that's owned by root, you need to use "sudo", too, for the same reason
2007-02-02T17:24:00.000Z	LjL	Cretemonster	well, a practical example: if i have a file named "test", that's owned by root, and i want it to be owned by ljl instead, i type "sudo chown ljl:ljl test"
2007-02-02T17:25:00.000Z	LjL	Cretemonster	that means "give the file 'test' owner 'ljl' and group 'ljl'" -- note that, by default, every user is created with a group of the same name attached
2007-02-02T17:26:00.000Z	LjL	Cretemonster	then if i want to make that 'test' file *only* readable, writable and executable by ljl, i type "chmod u=rwx test", which means "give the owning *u*ser *r*ead, *w*rite and e*x*ecute permissions"
2007-02-02T17:26:00.000Z	LjL	Cretemonster	this time i did not need to use "sudo", because the file was now owned by myself, and not by root anymore, since i used chown earlier
2007-02-02T17:30:00.000Z	LjL	Cretemonster	just type "sudo chown -R yourusername:yourusername /path/to/the/affected/directory" -- i hope that said directory *should* actually be owned by you rather than by root, as you said
2007-02-02T17:32:00.000Z	LjL	Cretemonster	make it crete:crete, not just crete... but, no, not really, nothing in /var/lib should be owner by a "standard" user i believe.
2007-02-02T17:32:00.000Z	LjL	Cretemonster	so, may that directory ever contain any files that should not be read by other people? (passwords, whatever)
2007-02-02T17:33:00.000Z	LjL	Cretemonster	if it contains no sensitive files, then you can do  chmod -R a+rw /var/lib/nepenthes , this will make every file in that directory readable and writable by any user
2007-02-02T17:34:00.000Z	LjL	Cretemonster	that's a security risk, however, unless you know with *certainty* that there can *not* be *any* sensitive information in that directory
2007-02-02T17:34:00.000Z	LjL	Cretemonster	"only"?
2007-02-02T17:38:00.000Z	LjL	Cretemonster	no problem
2007-02-02T17:39:00.000Z	LjL	Cretemonster	it does sound like something that's not very security sensitive, if i understood it correctly
