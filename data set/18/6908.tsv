2012-01-24T12:36:00.000Z	GwaiLo	ActionParsnip	it has a parity drive and a hot swap
2012-01-24T12:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	GwaiLo	intrepid is very dead dude. I'd clean install oneiric or even precise prerelease as it will be LTS
2012-01-24T12:34:00.000Z	GwaiLo	ActionParsnip	I very much want to upgrade from it... it's just a storage server and unfortunately there's absolutely no way I can format and reinstall, I need to upgrade cause I just don't have the space to store the data while formatting and reinstalling
2012-01-24T12:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	GwaiLo	do you not have a backup?
2012-01-24T12:36:00.000Z	GwaiLo	ActionParsnip	this is my backup server. I don't have anywhere else I can store the data
2012-01-24T12:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	GwaiLo	a drive motor fails. The drive doesn't spin up. Where is your data?
2012-01-24T12:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	GwaiLo	its go
2012-01-24T12:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	GwaiLo	gonna be a long climb
2012-01-24T12:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	GwaiLo	intrepid to jaunty to karmic to lucid to precise
2012-01-24T12:39:00.000Z	GwaiLo	ActionParsnip	If I follow the instructions on the EOLUpgrade will I get there eventually?
2012-01-24T12:39:00.000Z	GwaiLo	ActionParsnip	I'm ok if it takes a week or two for the various updates to take place etc.
2012-01-24T12:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	GwaiLo	eventually yes. Its going to be a lot of time and bandwidth
2012-01-24T12:41:00.000Z	GwaiLo	ActionParsnip	I'll check with the housemates and see if it's worth the effort :) Thanks very much for your help... I'll follow the instructions on there and see what happens
2012-01-24T12:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	GwaiLo	once you get to precise you are set for 5 years :-)
2012-01-24T12:41:00.000Z	GwaiLo	ActionParsnip	haha
2012-01-24T13:00:00.000Z	GwaiLo	ActionParsnip	sorry to bug you again... but I've followed the EOL instructions, sudo aptitude update && sudo aptitude safe-upgrade seems to finish successfully, but when I do the do-release-upgrade, it fails when trying to extract the jaunty.tar.gz
2012-01-24T13:01:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	GwaiLo	you could grab the jaunty alternate iso, mount it and run the upgrade script in the root of the iso
2012-01-24T13:02:00.000Z	GwaiLo	ActionParsnip	cheers, that sounds like a good idea
