2006-11-29T15:40:00.000Z	jumble		sorry to ask again, but... i'm trying to run the live ubuntu 6.10 cd for the first time and i get an error message "Failed to start the x server... it is likely that it is not set up correctly." i have no idea what the problem or where to begin looking... any advice?
2006-11-29T15:42:00.000Z	Doow	jumble	there could be a number of reasons for that error, type "tail /var/log/Xorg.0.log" in a console
2006-11-29T15:43:00.000Z	Doow	jumble	oh, the live-cd
2006-11-29T15:43:00.000Z	Doow	jumble	then I'm not sure
2006-11-29T15:43:00.000Z	Doow	jumble	I don't know how it handles logs
2006-11-29T15:45:00.000Z	Doow	jumble	you could do that I guess, otoh it's hard to know if you will get X running afterwards if we don't know what the reason for the live cd failing is
2006-11-29T15:50:00.000Z	Doow	jumble	think of it as the textbased interface
2006-11-29T16:15:00.000Z	Doow	jumble	I hope =)
2006-11-29T16:16:00.000Z	Doow	jumble	before you were looking at what should be X/gnome but failed
2006-11-29T16:17:00.000Z	Doow	jumble	if you need more than one
2006-11-29T16:17:00.000Z	Doow	jumble	you never know =)
2006-11-29T16:18:00.000Z	Doow	jumble	can you paste your log to that site?
2006-11-29T16:19:00.000Z	Doow	jumble	oh, I missed that, sorry
2006-11-29T16:19:00.000Z	Doow	jumble	what's the link?
2006-11-29T16:19:00.000Z	Doow	jumble	anythings possible, dunno if the odds are good though
2006-11-29T16:26:00.000Z	Doow	jumble	Only thing I can see is that it can't find your graphics card, can't really say why
2006-11-29T16:27:00.000Z	Doow	jumble	post your /etc/X11/xorg.conf too
2006-11-29T16:28:00.000Z	Doow	jumble	 then there's some command you can do to dump your pci info, but I don't remember it
