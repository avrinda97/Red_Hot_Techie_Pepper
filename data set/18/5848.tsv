2009-09-01T22:46:00.000Z	guntbert	Halitech	Msku has only 2GB :-(
2009-09-01T22:47:00.000Z	Halitech	guntbert	ahhh, wubi install that went wrong?
2009-09-01T22:48:00.000Z	guntbert	Halitech	I have no experience with wubi, so I cannot possibly know :-)
2009-09-01T22:49:00.000Z	Halitech	guntbert	I've never used it either (don't even dual boot) but I've seen some posts where people will use it and the size is 2.3gig
2009-09-01T22:51:00.000Z	guntbert	Halitech	you could be right about the 2.3 GB :-)
2009-09-01T22:52:00.000Z	Halitech	guntbert	well it seems to be the bare minimum that Ubuntu will install on
2009-09-01T22:57:00.000Z	guntbert	Halitech	I suppose he will come back soon, because the partions on disk are *now* (at least) problematical, see http://paste.ubuntu.com/263305/
2009-09-01T22:58:00.000Z	Halitech	guntbert	yup, looks like about 2 gig in an extended partition, glad its not me
2009-09-02T22:50:00.000Z	guntbert	Halitech	its an ongoing discussion
2009-09-02T22:50:00.000Z	Halitech	guntbert	I know but reposting his question isn't going to get him an aswer any faster
2009-09-02T22:51:00.000Z	guntbert	Halitech	:)
2009-09-03T00:02:00.000Z	Halitech	guntbert	no wories, sometimes I run out of ideas
2009-12-12T22:31:00.000Z	guntbert	Halitech	no, that only tells the running kernel, not the hardware/cpu
2009-12-12T22:31:00.000Z	Halitech	guntbert	according to uname --help -m, --machine            print the machine hardware name
2009-12-12T22:32:00.000Z	guntbert	Halitech	I'd swear that is *not* the actual hardware
2009-12-12T22:33:00.000Z	Halitech	guntbert	I'm pretty sure that when I was running 32bit on this machine it still showed the machine as x86_64
2009-12-12T22:35:00.000Z	guntbert	Halitech	well I'm "pretty sure" otherwise but I cannot look it up now - got to leave
2009-12-12T22:39:00.000Z	Halitech	guntbert	man pages don't explain it either so guess we are at a stalement until someone proves one of us wrong
