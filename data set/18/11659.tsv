2006-07-02T10:15:00.000Z	arapehl		Hey, has anyone ever gotten IE to work on Linux? As a web developer it's kinda important for me to be able to test my work in IE as well as FF.
2006-07-02T10:16:00.000Z	bimberi	arapehl	yes, using wine
2006-07-02T10:16:00.000Z	arapehl	bimberi	thanks!
2006-07-02T10:16:00.000Z	bimberi	arapehl	frankscorner.org has good info for getting things like IE running
2006-07-02T10:16:00.000Z	bimberi	arapehl	np :)
2006-07-06T07:01:00.000Z	arapehl	bimberi	is that also for the JDK? Because the JRE is different.
2006-07-06T07:21:00.000Z	bimberi	arapehl	still there?  yes the jdk is there - package sun-java5-jdk
2006-07-06T08:29:00.000Z	bimberi	arapehl	fyi, the build-essential package includes gcc and a few other things for compiling software
2006-07-06T08:30:00.000Z	arapehl	bimberi	that might explain why it still isn't working and says "plugin not found"... sigh... so I install build-essential then?
2006-07-06T08:31:00.000Z	bimberi	arapehl	yes, try that first
2006-07-06T08:31:00.000Z	arapehl	bimberi	will it conflict/overwrite with the separate gcc I installed since it comes with it? (I'm installing it as we speak btw)
2006-07-06T08:32:00.000Z	bimberi	arapehl	no, gcc is a dependency, it will just install build-essential and its other dependencies.  This is assuming you're using an APT tool (synaptic, apt-get ...) to install gcc
2006-07-06T08:33:00.000Z	arapehl	bimberi	yeah, I've been using apt-get... so now I have build-essential and gcc installed but the stupid thing still bombs on me and says "No matching plugin was found." Any ideas? ;)
2006-07-06T08:34:00.000Z	arapehl	bimberi	I'm trying to build a package for java_ee_sdk-5-linux.bin
2006-07-06T08:34:00.000Z	bimberi	arapehl	put the command and the error on the pastebin
2006-07-06T08:35:00.000Z	arapehl	bimberi	http://pastebin.ca/80121
2006-07-06T08:38:00.000Z	bimberi	arapehl	gee that's an informative message :|.  perhaps check that those files are present on your system
