2008-08-10T02:11:00.000Z	jonah		hello can anyone please help
2008-08-10T02:12:00.000Z	jonah		how do i empty the trash bin of the root account?
2008-08-10T02:14:00.000Z	unop	jonah	sudo rm -rf /root/.local/share/Trash/*
2008-08-10T02:16:00.000Z	jonah	unop	hey thanks but the files are all still there
2008-08-10T02:17:00.000Z	jonah	unop	is there a more powerful method?
2008-08-10T02:17:00.000Z	unop	jonah	that empty's root's trash .. not yours .. are you looking at your trash can there?
2008-08-10T02:17:00.000Z	jonah	unop	no i'm looking in the root trash, but can't delete the files
2008-08-10T02:17:00.000Z	unop	jonah	did the command fail with any errors?
2008-08-10T02:18:00.000Z	jonah	unop	the command acted as if it worked. no errors, then i open up the root trash and loads of stuff in there
2008-08-10T02:19:00.000Z	unop	jonah	does this return anything?  ls -l /root/.local/share/Trash/*
2008-08-10T02:20:00.000Z	jonah	unop	 ls: cannot access /root/.local/share/Trash/*: No such file or directory
2008-08-10T02:21:00.000Z	unop	jonah	hmm, maybe the files are located elsewhere, you could try finding them.  find /root -iname "*filename*"
2008-08-10T02:23:00.000Z	jonah	unop	but they are in the trash folder in /root/lib/share/trash/files or whatever, cos when i go in nautilus to that folder they're all in there
2008-08-10T02:24:00.000Z	unop	jonah	hmm, odd.. guess you will have to delete the files from that directory then.  sudo rm -rf /root/lib/share/trash/files/*
2008-08-10T02:25:00.000Z	jonah	unop	that's what we just did though and they're still there
2008-08-10T02:25:00.000Z	unop	jonah	it's not what we did earlier
2008-08-10T02:29:00.000Z	jonah	unop	done that and they're still in there
2008-08-10T02:30:00.000Z	unop	jonah	does ls still list them?
