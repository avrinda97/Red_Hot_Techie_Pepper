2008-10-13T16:39:00.000Z	Plz	airtonix	I have, but it sucks asses.
2008-10-13T16:39:00.000Z	airtonix	Plz	 office can open rtf
2008-10-13T16:40:00.000Z	airtonix	Plz	thats your opinion
2008-10-13T16:41:00.000Z	airtonix	Plz	actually it does
2008-10-13T16:42:00.000Z	airtonix	Plz	well that leaves you with doc
2008-10-13T16:42:00.000Z	airtonix	Plz	but abiword does a better job with word format than openoffice does
2008-10-13T16:43:00.000Z	Plz	airtonix	thanks for the tip, but I rather use OOo.
2008-10-13T16:46:00.000Z	Plz	airtonix	well, I cannot force Microsoft Office users to install that plugin.
2008-10-13T16:47:00.000Z	Plz	airtonix	I need to use something that everyone can use... the whole point with opensource?? eh?
2008-10-13T16:47:00.000Z	airtonix	Plz	but i like how you are willing to do what they wont
2008-10-13T16:48:00.000Z	airtonix	Plz	what choice do you have if you wont use doc or rtf? ms word wont read anything else apart from html and then once they touch that it will go from being a 16k document to a 160k document
2008-10-13T16:49:00.000Z	Plz	airtonix	Why does it increase that much when you edit it in Microsoft Office?
2008-10-13T16:51:00.000Z	airtonix	Plz	if they make any changes (which is a most likley prospect because word will go ohnoes a non ms html file....must popup dialouge of fear) word will start filling it with all kinds of nonsense styling for-ever-single-paragraph....
2008-10-13T16:51:00.000Z	airtonix	Plz	see for yourself...create a document in word using the html format and afterwards look at its source...things just like using frontpage
