2009-10-17T05:42:00.000Z	vlox		how do you change the mac address of your box, or of your NIC?
2009-10-17T05:44:00.000Z	vlox		i cant make sense of those manuals
2009-10-17T05:45:00.000Z	vlt	vlox	"hw ether ad:dr:es:s" with ifconfig or in /etc/network/interfaces
2009-10-17T05:47:00.000Z	vlox	vlt	does eth0 go in the place of ether?
2009-10-17T05:47:00.000Z	vlt	vlox	no, "ether is the device class"
2009-10-17T05:47:00.000Z	vlt	vlox	no, "ether" is the device class
2009-10-17T05:49:00.000Z	vlox	vlt	what does that mean?
2009-10-17T05:49:00.000Z	vlt	vlox	Have you read `man ifconfig`?
2009-10-17T05:52:00.000Z	vlt	vlox	It says "ifconfig interface options". Then look at section OPTIONS, you'll find the hw ether part I already posted.
2009-10-17T05:53:00.000Z	vlox	vlt	what is hw ether?
2009-10-17T05:55:00.000Z	vlt	vlox	Please read the section in the manpage I pointed to.
2009-10-17T05:59:00.000Z	vlox	vlt	that's what it says
2009-10-17T06:02:00.000Z	vlt	vlox	What's the problem then?
2009-10-17T06:04:00.000Z	vlox	vlt	what's the hardware class of a wifi card, and what do they mean ascii equivalent?
2009-10-17T06:08:00.000Z	vlox	vlt	what's the hardware class of a wifi card, and what do they mean ascii equivalent?
2009-10-17T06:08:00.000Z	vlt	vlox	On top of all possible ecryption wifi cards are talking ethernet too. The ascii equivalent is the 12:34:56:78:90 notation
2009-10-17T06:13:00.000Z	vlt	vlox	i think it won't let xou change the hw address when the interface is up.
2009-10-17T06:32:00.000Z	vlox	vlt	every time i try to edit resolv.conf it resets upon restart
