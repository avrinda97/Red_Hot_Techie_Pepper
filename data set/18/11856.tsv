2006-07-21T09:10:00.000Z	dicesquirrel		So, should I give up on fglrx, or what?
2006-07-21T09:11:00.000Z	dicesquirrel		Give up any hope of ever getting Enemy Territory working again? Maybe build a time travel machine to a few weeks ago when OpenGL actually worked?
2006-07-21T09:11:00.000Z	wastrel	dicesquirrel	 did you install the fglrx drivers after the kernel upgrade?
2006-07-21T09:12:00.000Z	dicesquirrel	wastrel	everything is up to date, according to apt-get
2006-07-21T09:12:00.000Z	wastrel	dicesquirrel	 i had to reinstall the fglrx driver after the kernel upgrade this week
2006-07-21T09:13:00.000Z	dicesquirrel	wastrel	how might I do that?
2006-07-21T09:13:00.000Z	wastrel	dicesquirrel	 https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BinaryDriverHowto/ATI    the install lines
2006-07-21T09:15:00.000Z	dicesquirrel	wastrel	so I should just apt-get remove xorg-driver-fglrx and then install it?
2006-07-21T09:15:00.000Z	wastrel	dicesquirrel	 no need to remove, just install it
2006-07-21T09:15:00.000Z	dicesquirrel	wastrel	I have. It's completely up to date, and not working, that's what I'm saying, and why I'm so frustrated.
2006-07-21T09:16:00.000Z	wastrel	dicesquirrel	 so you've installed since the recent kernel upgrade?
2006-07-21T09:16:00.000Z	dicesquirrel	wastrel	"xorg-driver-fglrx is already the newest version." is the line from apt-get
2006-07-21T09:17:00.000Z	dicesquirrel	wastrel	there's absolutely nothing left to upgrade. So why is it not working?
2006-07-21T09:18:00.000Z	dicesquirrel	wastrel	yes, and the new xorg.conf it generates sends me straight to the commandline, no gdm
2006-07-21T09:19:00.000Z	dicesquirrel	wastrel	I mean, I do fglrxinfo and it gives me some lines about Mesa. How do I fix that? That seems like it could be the root of the problem.
2006-07-21T09:19:00.000Z	wastrel	dicesquirrel	 that's your fglrx driver not working -  check /var/log/Xorg.0.log  for errors
2006-07-21T09:50:00.000Z	wastrel	dicesquirrel	 just FYI, if there's an xorg.conf in your home directory, it takes precedence over the system xorg.conf in /etc/X11
2006-07-21T09:51:00.000Z	dicesquirrel	wastrel	there isn't
