2008-10-02T22:56:00.000Z	rmn	NiCK_NaME_	there are plenty, but you will probably have to enable them separately.  use ccsm for that.

2008-10-02T22:58:00.000Z	NiCK_NaME_	rmn	okay okay    ccsm   okay i tried to install virtualbox, right ? well i tried it like 3 times and everytime i had to reinstall ubuntu...   because like i said I HAVE NO CLUE what i am doing...    will ccsm   take a experianced user  like virtualbox ?
2008-10-02T22:58:00.000Z	NiCK_NaME_	rmn	because im tired of reinstalling stuff mannn soooo tired it started to give me flash backs of using windows... just trying to get virtualbox...
2008-10-02T22:59:00.000Z	rmn	NiCK_NaME_	don't see why virtualbox would require reinstall?  ccsm has many, many options, so don't mess with too many options at the same time.  then you will know which to revert back
