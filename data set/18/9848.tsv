2007-02-17T12:44:00.000Z	sebrock		where can I turn off the multimedia keys in gnome?
2007-02-17T12:44:00.000Z	xtknight	sebrock	gnome-keybinding-properties
2007-02-17T12:44:00.000Z	sebrock	xtknight	thank you!
2007-02-17T12:45:00.000Z	sebrock	xtknight	well I've been there before, it has no button for turning them off tho???
2007-02-17T12:45:00.000Z	xtknight	sebrock	press backspace on the commands you want disabled
2007-02-17T12:46:00.000Z	sebrock	xtknight	hmm... ok
2007-04-21T12:57:00.000Z	xtknight	sebrock	it should install grub..
2007-04-21T12:57:00.000Z	sebrock	xtknight	well I saw the installation detected windows
2007-04-21T12:57:00.000Z	sebrock	xtknight	but it still boots into win :/
2007-04-21T12:58:00.000Z	xtknight	sebrock	ah well it's some type of problem.  unexpected behavior, certainly
2007-04-21T12:59:00.000Z	sebrock	xtknight	yeah I guess, gonna reinstall it using system rescue cd..., by the way, looks like it didnt detect my wifi either, 6.10 did...
2007-04-21T12:59:00.000Z	xtknight	sebrock	ahh ok.  i cant guarantee it will reinstall properly either.  it's probably a boot order thing.
2007-04-21T13:00:00.000Z	xtknight	sebrock	grub got installed it's just a matter of which MBR
2007-04-21T13:00:00.000Z	xtknight	sebrock	if you have multiple HDs try setting default to the other HDs,  do that until it boots properly.  and just use the HD that works since grub will boot windows also
2007-04-21T13:00:00.000Z	sebrock	xtknight	well both win and ubuntu is on the same disc
2007-04-21T13:01:00.000Z	sebrock	xtknight	gonna check with sys cd, see whats in /boot/grub
2007-04-21T13:01:00.000Z	xtknight	sebrock	well it's probably an MBR problem
2007-04-21T13:02:00.000Z	sebrock	xtknight	maybe
