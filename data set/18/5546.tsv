2009-03-12T19:49:00.000Z	dronix	adrenaline	does your keyboard work?
2009-03-12T19:50:00.000Z	adrenaline	dronix	yes but I am starting to notice the same problem on the keyboard too
2009-03-12T19:54:00.000Z	dronix	adrenaline	sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-input-all
2009-03-12T19:55:00.000Z	adrenaline	dronix	already install
2009-03-12T19:55:00.000Z	adrenaline	dronix	it is on a usb KVswitch and it is working correctly on the other server
2009-03-12T19:56:00.000Z	dronix	adrenaline	is it a linux server?
2009-03-12T19:56:00.000Z	dronix	adrenaline	is it linux?
2009-03-12T19:57:00.000Z	adrenaline	dronix	it is ubuntu
2009-03-12T19:57:00.000Z	dronix	adrenaline	try to reconfigure xorg
2009-03-12T19:57:00.000Z	dronix	adrenaline	sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2009-03-12T20:12:00.000Z	adrenaline	dronix	I eliminated the KV and it still does it. It is a USB issue with ubuntu I believe
2009-03-12T20:12:00.000Z	dronix	adrenaline	did u configure xorg
2009-03-12T20:13:00.000Z	adrenaline	dronix	Honestly I didn't because I don't want to break anything else yet. I was hoping to find the problem
2009-03-12T20:15:00.000Z	dronix	adrenaline	reconfiguring xorg should do anything anything else, your basically trying to restore it
2009-03-12T20:17:00.000Z	adrenaline	dronix	ya but I hate recofiguring things to try and fix problems. I was hoping to diagnose first I will try it but I want to try a couple of things first
2009-03-12T20:50:00.000Z	dronix	adrenaline	lol wow, I guess that works
2009-03-12T20:50:00.000Z	adrenaline	dronix	I plugged in PS2 mouse and keyboard rebooted and that fixed the issue so then I unplugged it and plugged in teh usb keyboard and mouse rebooted and it seemed to solve whatever was going on
