2010-03-27T12:44:00.000Z	harishz		can anyone please help me with installing nvidia drivers
2010-03-27T12:46:00.000Z	danx	harishz	open a Terminal (Aplications - Accessories - Terminal) and type: jockey-gtk
2010-03-27T12:46:00.000Z	harishz		i lost network connection while installing nvidia drivers when i was at 50%.
2010-03-27T12:47:00.000Z	harishz		after that i am not able to install it.  I get to see the downloading popup at 50% completion
2010-03-27T12:47:00.000Z	harishz		i have uninstalled and tried to reinstall...but it is still the same
2010-03-27T12:47:00.000Z	danx	harishz	give it time to finish, the completion bar is kinda buggy
2010-03-27T12:48:00.000Z	harishz	danx	as soon as i launch the click for download through envyng, the download bar automatically reaches 50% and doesnt move from there
2010-03-27T12:48:00.000Z	danx	harishz	you can try "sudo dpkg-reconfigre -a" if it doesn't work after a reasonable time span (~7 mins)
2010-03-27T12:48:00.000Z	harishz		it hangs there...i dont think it is downloading
2010-03-27T12:48:00.000Z	harishz	danx	thanks. i will try that
2010-03-27T12:53:00.000Z	harishz	danx	i still have the same problem
2010-03-27T12:54:00.000Z	harishz		the download window is not moving any further
2010-03-27T12:59:00.000Z	harishz		i lost network while installing nvidia drivers thru envyng.  the download was at 50%...now when i try  installing the drivers..i get to see the same popup
2010-03-27T12:59:00.000Z	harishz		and the download doesnt proceed any further..
2010-03-27T13:00:00.000Z	harishz		how do i install the nvidia drivers now
2010-03-27T13:01:00.000Z	danx	harishz	you can try installing the driver from nvidia.com
2010-03-27T13:33:00.000Z	harishz	danx	i am on 64bit and i cant find the drivers in nvidia.com
