2010-01-10T17:12:00.000Z	paissad		 hi all, i created a webradio with mpd+icecast2, and it's available at http://ip_adresss:port  and i would like to know if it's possible to make the website available like this http://paissad-radio.com for example without entering the port number
2010-01-10T17:14:00.000Z	paissad		http://paissad.homelinux:18000
2010-01-10T17:15:00.000Z	monokrome	paissad	Doesn't work here.
2010-01-10T17:14:00.000Z	monokrome	paissad	Is the server currently running on paissad-radio.com's IP address?
2010-01-10T17:14:00.000Z	paissad	monokrome	nick125 the server is running on http:paissad.homelinux:18000
2010-01-10T17:16:00.000Z	paissad	monokrome	http://paissad.homelinux.com:1800/mpd.ogg
2010-01-10T17:16:00.000Z	paissad	monokrome	sorry, port 18000 instead
2010-01-10T17:16:00.000Z	monokrome	paissad	Ah! I thought that 18000 sounded a bit high :)
2010-01-10T17:16:00.000Z	paissad	monokrome	you think that the port number is high ?
2010-01-10T17:16:00.000Z	monokrome	paissad	Only when you accidetally said 18000 :)
2010-01-10T17:18:00.000Z	monokrome	paissad	You have at least 3 options. 1) You can create a site that links to or plays http://paissad.homelinux.com:1800/mpd.ogg 2) You can use Apache + mod_proxy to forward requests to localhost:1800 3) You can change the IceCast server to run on port 80, if you aren't wanting to use Apache for anything else.
2010-01-10T17:18:00.000Z	paissad	monokrome	nick125 i just don't know anything about proxy :s ...
2010-01-10T17:19:00.000Z	monokrome	paissad	http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/mod/mod_proxy.html
2010-01-10T17:19:00.000Z	paissad	monokrome	nick125 i heard about squid, tor, but that 's all :D
2010-01-10T17:21:00.000Z	monokrome	paissad	With mod_proxy, you can tell apache to send specific URLs to another port and then display the results - so all of your other stuff wont be hurt when you use port 80.
2010-01-10T17:22:00.000Z	paissad	monokrome	nick125 ok mod_proxy seems good, i take a look on it :) ... thanks, i go STFW & RTFM
