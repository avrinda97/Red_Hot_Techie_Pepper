2011-08-23T23:29:00.000Z	lanceulot		oh it's too difficult theme (hello everybody ;). I tried to tune virtualization on my supported CPU. So, I have to say that there were a lot of problems with this :(
2011-08-23T23:29:00.000Z	fr500	lanceulot	??
2011-08-23T23:30:00.000Z	fr500	lanceulot	if you CPU supports VTd or VT-x it's all transparent
2011-08-23T23:32:00.000Z	lanceulot		<fr500> It was about one year ago, maybe there's transparent in new versions of ubuntu? I remember it was some problems  to tune it correctly...
2011-08-23T23:33:00.000Z	fr500	lanceulot	nothing to tune, you just have the choice to use binary translation or hadrware assisted most of the time
2011-08-23T23:36:00.000Z	lanceulot	fr500	one more question about it, how to tune shared space with files, that you can use from any OC in virtualization? It one of this problems, "just transparent tuning from VM" isn't tune this
2011-08-23T23:37:00.000Z	fr500	lanceulot	what virtualization software are ou using?
2011-08-23T23:39:00.000Z	lanceulot		something standart for ubuntu.. maybe virtualbox, I don't remember yet
2011-08-23T23:39:00.000Z	fr500	lanceulot	anyway, Virtual Machines are stored as files if using VBox or VMware, I don't get your question about space
2011-08-23T23:42:00.000Z	lanceulot	fr500	it creates a partition with all files of new OC, so, I haven't found a way to exchange files
2011-08-23T23:42:00.000Z	fr500	lanceulot	OC?
2011-08-23T23:42:00.000Z	fr500		what do you mean with OC
2011-08-23T23:42:00.000Z	fr500		OS?
2011-08-23T23:42:00.000Z	lanceulot		oh yeah, OS :D
2011-08-23T23:43:00.000Z	lanceulot		I'm not englishman, so, I make a mistake :)
2011-08-23T23:43:00.000Z	fr500	lanceulot	well it depends on the virtualization software and the OS
2011-08-23T23:43:00.000Z	fr500	lanceulot	if using VMware or virtualbox you can use shared folders. otherwise you might use SMB or NFS as if it was another PC
2011-08-23T23:45:00.000Z	lanceulot	fr500	I've tried to put my files into windows (VM) from ubuntu. I've tuned shared folders, so, It didn't work.
