2008-09-17T22:15:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	bobertdos	is envy supported during the upgrade process now?
2008-09-17T22:15:00.000Z	bobertdos	danbh_intrepid	I don't know. Truth be told, I'm an ATI user :p
2008-09-17T22:16:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	bobertdos	I thought that was one of the main problems of these third party installers.  That the installs cause upgrades to fail...
2008-09-17T22:19:00.000Z	bobertdos	danbh_intrepid	and I think it might still be, but I use the dkms method for my card, so again, I would not know
2008-09-19T10:58:00.000Z	bobertdos	danbh_intrepid	yes, of course :)
2008-10-04T23:00:00.000Z	bobertdos	danbh_intrepid	Have you done the things in that blog? In particular, did you ever try to configure that alsaconf file?
2008-10-05T00:22:00.000Z	bobertdos	danbh_intrepid	After reading that article, it does seem like most of the Pulse bugs we see here are Ubuntu specific, don't you think?
2008-10-05T00:23:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	bobertdos	no idea.  But I doubt ALL of them are just Ubuntu, since there were quite a few
2008-10-05T00:24:00.000Z	bobertdos	danbh_intrepid	yeah, I know. Hey, did you ever check to see if the repos have any of those packages those tutorials mention?
2008-10-05T21:50:00.000Z	bobertdos	danbh_intrepid	Actually, the factoid isn't appropriate for him because he needs to scan his windows partition.
2008-10-05T21:51:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	bobertdos	it still lists the virus scanners available
2008-10-05T21:52:00.000Z	bobertdos	danbh_intrepid	true
2008-10-05T22:01:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	bobertdos	ironically, that factoid is wrong
2008-10-06T10:36:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	bobertdos	yeah, pulse is better in intrepid  : )
2008-10-06T10:35:00.000Z	bobertdos	danbh_intrepid	I must express my joy!! The Pulse "multi-app" bug is gone!!!
2008-10-06T10:35:00.000Z	danbh_intrepid	bobertdos	what did I do?
2008-10-06T10:36:00.000Z	bobertdos	danbh_intrepid	Ah, I'm just telling you because of how many times we've talked about how annoying Pulse is in Hardy.
2008-10-06T10:36:00.000Z	bobertdos	danbh_intrepid	MUCH, and it makes me HAPPY!!
