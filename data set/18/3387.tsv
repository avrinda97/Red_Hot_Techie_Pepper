2009-12-27T22:08:00.000Z	alberto		Good afternoon everyone!
2009-12-27T22:08:00.000Z	alberto		I have a problem...My Tv Tuner card is wrongly recognised by Ubuntu 9.10 Karmic Koala
2009-12-27T22:09:00.000Z	alberto		It's a Hauppauge HVR-1100, but hardinfo and mythtv say it's a Philips one.
2009-12-27T22:09:00.000Z	alberto		Any ideas?
2009-12-27T22:10:00.000Z	alberto		I can't get it to work.
2009-12-27T22:10:00.000Z	alberto		What should I do?
2009-12-27T22:12:00.000Z	alberto		I think I'm gonna go back to Jaunty
2009-12-27T22:12:00.000Z	alberto		Karmic sucks
2009-12-27T22:12:00.000Z	domjohnson	alberto	agreed
2009-12-27T22:13:00.000Z	alberto	domjohnson	It causes many problems, doesn't it?
2009-12-27T22:13:00.000Z	domjohnson	alberto	indeed
2009-12-27T22:15:00.000Z	alberto	domjohnson	No, I mean DVD writers
2009-12-27T22:15:00.000Z	alberto	domjohnson	Excuse my english.
2009-12-27T22:16:00.000Z	alberto	domjohnson	Thank you
2009-12-27T22:17:00.000Z	alberto	domjohnson	My Ubuntu Karmic doesn't recognise my DVD writer as a writing device, only as a reading one.
2009-12-27T22:18:00.000Z	domjohnson	alberto	not sure...
2009-12-27T22:19:00.000Z	domjohnson	alberto	does nothing happen when you insert a blank CD/DVD?
