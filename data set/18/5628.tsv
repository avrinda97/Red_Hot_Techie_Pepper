2008-09-29T13:24:00.000Z	xnv	Daft_Punk	Uh, why Intel for processor?
2008-09-29T13:25:00.000Z	Daft_Punk	xnv	amd is not power efficient and intel has better processors than AMD at the moment (they are beating AMD in the market), regardless if AMD is slightly faster, it generates more heat and can burn out without sufficient heatsinks
2008-09-29T13:25:00.000Z	xnv	Daft_Punk	So in other words, you're giving your opinion about processors, not about their compatibility with Ubuntu. Thanks for clearing that up.
2008-09-29T13:26:00.000Z	Daft_Punk	xnv	in other words, processors dont have compatibility issues with ubuntu... just graphics and LAN cards for the most part
2008-09-29T13:27:00.000Z	xnv	Daft_Punk	I think that video is like 10 years old
2008-09-29T13:28:00.000Z	Daft_Punk	xnv	its not 10 years old, it was done while playing UT2, plus that still applies to today
2008-09-29T13:28:00.000Z	xnv	Daft_Punk	I've seen no evidence of that, so I doubt you have.
2008-09-29T13:29:00.000Z	Daft_Punk	xnv	by your comments i am assuming you are using AMD, there is no problem with that, im just saying that you have to have better heat dissipation, and that some of the newer high end intels are better than the higher end AMD's since intel is releasing quads and soon octas
2008-09-29T13:30:00.000Z	xnv	Daft_Punk	Again, I don't think you have any empirical evidence of this. And no, I don't use AMDs, but I don't avoid them.
2008-09-29T13:31:00.000Z	Daft_Punk	xnv	you don't have any empirical evidence against what im saying, so you shouldn't be so quick to dismiss it
2008-09-29T13:34:00.000Z	xnv	Daft_Punk	I wasn't quick. I tried to find out if you had any. And saying "you can't prove me wrong, so I'm right" is a logical fallacy.
2008-09-29T13:35:00.000Z	Daft_Punk	xnv	i didnt say i was 100% right due to a lack of evidence against what I am saying, that was an assumption on your part
2008-09-29T13:35:00.000Z	xnv	Daft_Punk	"i didn't say I was 100% right"? You mean I have to wait for you to say "I'm 100% right" before I question the advice you give people?
2008-09-29T13:37:00.000Z	Daft_Punk	xnv	ok obviously "advice" is biased, regardless who gives it, it is the advise of that person based on personal experiencecs. you are comparing apples and oranges here (windows and linux) both have pros and cons that outweigh eachother, i dont know why you are fixated on making this into an issue
2008-09-29T13:38:00.000Z	xnv	Daft_Punk	I guess I was annoyed that someone asked for compatibility info and you gave them product advocacy.
2008-09-29T13:40:00.000Z	Daft_Punk	xnv	that person asked about intels and graphics cards, I just said that intel is better to use for LAN and NVIDIA for graphics as they are the most compatible for ubuntu, I dont know why I said CPU exactly as that isnt really a compatability issue with ubuntu
2008-09-29T13:41:00.000Z	xnv	Daft_Punk	Maybe we just interpreted differently... "ï»¿how can i know the parts i choose will work with 8.04 or 8.10 ? there is a company i shall stick with ? intel-based or so ?" ... to me that is not asking if one is better than the other, but if one will work better with Ubuntu
