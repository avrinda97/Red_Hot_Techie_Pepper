2005-06-04T10:07:00.000Z	Davey		well, crap

2005-06-04T10:10:00.000Z	Davey		not using Nero
2005-06-04T10:11:00.000Z	cafuego	Davey	Use cdrecord. Works fine.
2005-06-04T10:23:00.000Z	cafuego	Davey	it could be a 1X cdrom
2005-06-04T10:23:00.000Z	Davey	cafuego	4x
2005-06-04T10:24:00.000Z	cafuego	Davey	I'm just saying, it could be worse ;-)
2005-06-04T10:24:00.000Z	Davey	cafuego	pfft
2005-06-04T11:17:00.000Z	cafuego	Davey	You can use the debian netinst and edit sources.list halfway through ;-)
2005-06-04T11:18:00.000Z	cafuego	Davey	Don't attempt that if you're not an advanced user, though.
2005-06-04T11:18:00.000Z	Davey	cafuego	oh, I'm quite profecient in linux, I'm just lazy ;)
2005-06-04T11:18:00.000Z	cafuego	Davey	it's not Linux fault your burner or cd is dumb. it works fine for millions of others.
2005-06-04T11:20:00.000Z	Davey	cafuego	sure it is :P
2005-07-05T08:04:00.000Z	cafuego	Davey	it's AAC format; which is "encrypted" mp4 I think. Do a google search and get the decrypter (the dvd guy wrote one)
2005-07-15T05:52:00.000Z	cafuego	Davey	5.10 <- note the 10
2005-09-15T10:17:00.000Z	Davey	cafuego	yeah, seems to :/
2005-09-15T10:17:00.000Z	cafuego	Davey	Well, it *is* version 0.1
