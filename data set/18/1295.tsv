2012-01-01T07:56:00.000Z	agamemnus		because!
2012-01-01T07:57:00.000Z	agamemnus		it won't compile with the gcc option... and when I set the -fpu option it says it doesn't know what that option is :|
2012-01-01T07:57:00.000Z	agamemnus		this is the only compiler
2012-01-01T07:57:00.000Z	agamemnus		for Freebasic
2012-01-01T07:57:00.000Z	agamemnus		:|
2012-01-01T07:59:00.000Z	agamemnus		we are, sort of
2012-01-01T07:59:00.000Z	agamemnus		I don't really know how the compiler works, to be honest.
2012-01-01T07:59:00.000Z	agamemnus		i think it asks for a c++ library and somehow adds it in
2012-01-01T07:59:00.000Z	agamemnus		or rather, C.
2012-01-01T08:00:00.000Z	agamemnus		libmysqlclient16 isn't it.
2012-01-01T08:00:00.000Z	itsnotabigtruck	agamemnus	what's the problem again?
2012-01-01T08:02:00.000Z	itsnotabigtruck	agamemnus	ok, so, what version of ubuntu is it
2012-01-01T08:05:00.000Z	itsnotabigtruck	agamemnus	oh lovely...ok, so download the source
2012-01-01T08:07:00.000Z	itsnotabigtruck	agamemnus	even if you did it wouldn't be a good idea
2012-01-01T08:08:00.000Z	itsnotabigtruck	agamemnus	ffs, then go load up centos and test with that :p
2012-01-01T08:09:00.000Z	itsnotabigtruck	agamemnus	the image file is an ISO, right?
2012-01-01T08:09:00.000Z	itsnotabigtruck	agamemnus	you burn it to a disc, boot off of it, install it
2012-01-01T08:16:00.000Z	itsnotabigtruck	agamemnus	anyway, read up about compiling stuff on linux...it's easy
