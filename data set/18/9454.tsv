2007-04-06T05:46:00.000Z	Andrew250	Firefoxman	have you used partitionMagic?
2007-04-06T05:49:00.000Z	Andrew250	Firefoxman	should it be a logical or primary partition?
2007-04-06T05:50:00.000Z	Andrew250	Firefoxman	Why is an exteneded partition made?
2007-04-06T05:51:00.000Z	Andrew250	Firefoxman	this will be the only partition on the drive.
2007-04-06T05:53:00.000Z	Andrew250	Firefoxman	this is a second drive that I'm using for documents and the first drive will be for the OSs.
2007-04-06T05:55:00.000Z	Andrew250	Firefoxman	The first drive (120GB) has 3 partitions for the 3 different OSs the second drive (160) connected by USB will be for my files.
2007-04-06T05:58:00.000Z	Andrew250	Firefoxman	SHIT too late.
2007-04-06T05:59:00.000Z	Andrew250	Firefoxman	I've already started formating
2007-04-06T06:00:00.000Z	Andrew250	Firefoxman	can I install while it's formating?
2007-04-06T06:01:00.000Z	Andrew250	Firefoxman	No I have it on my large back up hd.
2007-04-06T06:02:00.000Z	Andrew250	Firefoxman	I was just think about my back up drive.  Should I leave it NTFS, is it easy to send files from ext3 to NTFS?
2007-04-06T06:03:00.000Z	Andrew250	Firefoxman	or should I convert that one to Ext3 as well?
2007-04-06T06:06:00.000Z	Andrew250	Firefoxman	is there a faster why to talk with someone on IRC then typing in there name everything?
2007-04-06T06:25:00.000Z	Andrew250	Firefoxman	Do you have any idea why there was a lost+found folder placed in the new drive?
2007-04-06T06:26:00.000Z	Andrew250	Firefoxman	And why 12 GBs are already eaten up?
2007-04-06T06:28:00.000Z	Andrew250	Firefoxman	may I PM you?
2007-04-06T07:09:00.000Z	Andrew250	Firefoxman	are you still online?
