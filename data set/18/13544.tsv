2005-11-05T16:06:00.000Z	NoUse	_kriss	if you could be more specific than "didn't work", could you pastebin the output?
2005-11-05T16:07:00.000Z	_kriss	NoUse	it's more a generic question ... what means the universe or multiverse stuff ??
2005-11-05T16:09:00.000Z	NoUse	_kriss	its the repository that contains the software you want
2005-11-05T16:09:00.000Z	_kriss		nouse and why is umbrello not in the kde packages included ?? it is an essential ... or not ??
2005-11-05T16:09:00.000Z	NoUse	_kriss	its not in the install image, its not essential
2005-11-05T16:10:00.000Z	_kriss		nouse ok i'll give a try .. thanks a lot ;)
