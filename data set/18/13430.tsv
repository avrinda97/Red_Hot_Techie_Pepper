2006-01-02T14:34:00.000Z	delltony		can't get grub to reinstall
2006-01-02T14:34:00.000Z	delltony		trying to follow wiki but doing something wrong i guess
2006-01-02T14:34:00.000Z	delltony		says can't find /boot/
2006-01-02T14:35:00.000Z	delltony		cause i mounted my drive and i can see the linux drive from the live cd and all
2006-01-02T14:35:00.000Z	delltony		but i can't get the grub to reinstall
2006-01-02T14:35:00.000Z	navarone	delltony	are you trying to reinstall into mbr or "?" or ubuntu partition?
2006-01-02T14:38:00.000Z	navarone	delltony	when I ahd to reinstall grub I mounted my linux partiton and was able to do "sudo grub-install fd0"...however that is for floppy disk which is all I use. You need to know where you want grub installed
2006-01-02T14:58:00.000Z	navarone	delltony	when you resized partition the partition table was probably changed...therefore your current grub is probably invalid. Use install disk to enter "rescue" mode type resuce at boot prompt and reinstall grub
2006-01-02T14:58:00.000Z	navarone	delltony	do you want grub in mbr or on floppy?
2006-01-02T14:59:00.000Z	navarone	delltony	, one drive or two?
2006-01-02T15:01:00.000Z	delltony	navarone	can you please pm me
2006-01-02T15:03:00.000Z	navarone	delltony	when I did the grun reinstall I had to mkdir /mnt/mydir and then mount hda2 /mnt/mydir   then I accessed partition and reinstalled grub...sorry if I am vague but was a few days ago...lol
2006-01-02T15:05:00.000Z	delltony	navarone	can you please pm me and we walk thru it one by one?
2006-01-02T15:19:00.000Z	navarone	delltony	it would be hda1 if you have windows installed on same drive...hda0 is first then hda1 is second partition
2006-01-02T15:22:00.000Z	navarone	delltony	does the grub menu simply hang?
2006-01-02T15:24:00.000Z	navarone	delltony	does it say Linux filesystem?
2006-01-02T15:25:00.000Z	navarone	delltony	I think I am out of my experience. I have only installed grub on floppy in order to avoid this sort of thing with mbr...lol
