2011-01-09T07:32:00.000Z	zaery		So, i have an external hdd, it's always "busy" or "being used", and when i unplug it, ubuntu thinks the drive is still connected and busy. is there any way for me to be able to use this drive again?
2011-01-09T07:34:00.000Z	rusty149	zaery	where is it mounted?
2011-01-09T07:35:00.000Z	rusty149	zaery	no it should be /dev/sdc1 or sdc2 etc
2011-01-09T07:36:00.000Z	rusty149	zaery	Is this a removable device?
2011-01-09T07:38:00.000Z	rusty149	zaery	sudo swapoff && sudo umount /dev/sdc1   that should safely remove the device
2011-01-09T07:39:00.000Z	zaery	rusty149	swapoff told me how to use it
2011-01-09T07:40:00.000Z	rusty149	zaery	sudo swapoff /dev/sdc2 && sudo umount /dev/sdc1
2011-01-09T07:43:00.000Z	zaery	rusty149	disk utility still sees it as a busy drive
2011-01-09T07:44:00.000Z	rusty149	zaery	reconnect device
2011-01-09T07:45:00.000Z	rusty149	zaery	sudo sync && sudo swapoff /dev/sdc2 && sudo umount /dev/sdc1
2011-01-09T07:46:00.000Z	rusty149	zaery	reconnect it and then run the last commands I said
2011-01-09T07:51:00.000Z	zaery	rusty149	about how long should it sit there with a cursor waiting to do the commands?
2011-01-09T07:52:00.000Z	rusty149	zaery	usually there is nothing to sync. But if the is lots of data then that might be why it was still busy
2011-01-09T08:11:00.000Z	zaery	rusty149	it's still syncing, it's a 500gb drive if that matters
2011-01-09T08:13:00.000Z	rusty149	zaery	I didn;t say it was syncing. Try Ctrl+c    Then: sudo sync    see if it takes long time again
2011-01-09T08:15:00.000Z	zaery	rusty149	yup, it looks like it's taking a long time to sync
2011-01-09T08:19:00.000Z	rusty149	zaery	is swap on?
2011-01-09T08:19:00.000Z	zaery	rusty149	nope, all of my swaps are off
