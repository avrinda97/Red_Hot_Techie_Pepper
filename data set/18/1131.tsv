2011-05-29T04:00:00.000Z	liveuser		what's a recommended size for '/' and '/home'? ubuntu is my secondary os and i do run a test server on it and would like some room but not too much. so i guess i want to know what minimum is so i can use a little more than that
2011-05-29T04:01:00.000Z	sudokill	liveuser	whats  the size of ur drive
2011-05-29T04:01:00.000Z	sudokill		or free space
2011-05-29T04:02:00.000Z	sudokill		u can prob get away with 3 or 4 gigs for root rest for home
2011-05-29T04:02:00.000Z	liveuser	sudokill	my drive is 500 mbs
2011-05-29T04:02:00.000Z	sudokill		nah too small
2011-05-29T04:02:00.000Z	sudokill		way too small
2011-05-29T04:02:00.000Z	sudokill		maybe something like damn small linux
2011-05-29T04:03:00.000Z	sudokill		idk much about small distros but if ur new to linux u might find htem harder to use
2011-05-29T04:04:00.000Z	liveuser	sudokill	how about 20500bs for / and 20500 for /home ?
