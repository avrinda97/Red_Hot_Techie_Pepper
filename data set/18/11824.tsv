2007-07-16T05:23:00.000Z	chris__		i never got a hello on my first time here (lol)
2007-07-16T05:24:00.000Z	chris__		how come ubuntu puts not effort into kubuntu like the restricted device manager is only for ubuntu but not for the kubuntu....
2007-07-16T05:25:00.000Z	chris__		!info ubotu
2007-07-16T05:25:00.000Z	chris__		i thought this room was just a big doc (lol)
2007-07-16T05:26:00.000Z	chris__		can i tell the wifi manager witch network to connect to first (if i have 2 networks in my area and sometimes mine goes down....)
2007-07-16T05:26:00.000Z	jrib	chris__	help.ubuntu.com  should take you to all the docs
2007-07-17T07:17:00.000Z	jrib	chris__	are you using xfce (xubuntu)?
2007-07-17T07:20:00.000Z	jrib	chris__	the o is a default feature of xfce which is why I ask
2007-07-17T07:22:00.000Z	chris__	jrib	yes i use xfce, and it was a feisty upgrade, not a fresh install.
2007-07-17T07:23:00.000Z	jrib	chris__	xfce has that 'o', it's a feature, not a bug.  It makes the window visible on all workspaces
2007-07-17T07:24:00.000Z	chris__	jrib	ok, thanks! can i turn that feature off or configure it?
2007-07-17T07:25:00.000Z	jrib	chris__	that I'm not sure about.  You can probably remove it somehow, try asking in #xubuntu or #xfce if no one here knows offhand
2007-10-02T15:21:00.000Z	jrib	chris__	you need to state your actual problem
2007-10-02T15:23:00.000Z	jrib	chris__	ignore what everyone says and concentrate on what people say to you
2009-06-19T08:07:00.000Z	jrib	chris__	itunes does not have a linux version
