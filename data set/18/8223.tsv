2007-10-14T07:29:00.000Z	heguru		[MH] NarcismLapto: do you get any error?
2007-10-14T07:30:00.000Z	heguru		[MH] NarcismLapto: are you installing using english language or some other?
2007-10-14T07:31:00.000Z	heguru		[MH] NarcismLapto: is the machine in front of you now? if yes press Ctrl+Alt+F3 (of F4, F5 onwards) so you get the log screen with more details on the error
2007-10-14T07:33:00.000Z	heguru		[MH] NarcismLapto: which mode? Press Ctrl+Alt+F1 to get back to installer screen and Ctrl+Alt+F3 onwards to go to other screens
2007-10-14T07:35:00.000Z	evolipel	heguru	I just don't know how to tell network-manager to use what channel
2007-10-14T07:35:00.000Z	heguru		[MH] NarcismLapto: are you using LiveCD or Alternate? (i thought you said alternate) anyways in live cd (graphical) you can go back to your installation screen by pressing Ctrl+Alt+F7
2007-10-14T07:35:00.000Z	heguru	evolipel	actually you cannot tell NM as it detects itself :(
2007-10-14T07:35:00.000Z	heguru	evolipel	let me check if there is a way to override it though
2007-10-14T07:35:00.000Z	evolipel	heguru	yeah, I know...
2007-10-14T07:38:00.000Z	heguru	evolipel	well nm doesnt store channel with the network settings :(
2007-10-14T07:38:00.000Z	heguru	evolipel	it autodetects it at connect time
2007-10-14T07:38:00.000Z	evolipel	heguru	is there any way I can bypass using nm?
2007-10-14T07:39:00.000Z	heguru	evolipel	yes you can do manual configuration, wpa would require some reason
2007-10-14T07:39:00.000Z	heguru		!wpa | evolipel
2007-10-14T07:39:00.000Z	heguru		[MH] NarcismLapto: try Ctrl+Alt+F8 onwards
2007-10-14T07:39:00.000Z	heguru		[MH] NarcismLapto: on one of the screens, you'll get the log of errors, just read the last line to see what the error was
2007-10-14T07:40:00.000Z	evolipel	heguru	okay, thanks...
