2009-03-20T21:30:00.000Z	stefan_can		nacho you must upgrade you alsa drivers
2009-03-20T21:30:00.000Z	nacho	stefan_can	I donwloaded the current version from alsa web, and compile it manually
2009-03-20T21:30:00.000Z	nacho		I need any more that alsa-driver*?
2009-03-20T21:30:00.000Z	stefan_can	nacho	well it can't be the newest version as I have alsactl version 1.0.15  on a hardy install
2009-03-20T21:31:00.000Z	stefan_can		last time I did it it was version 18
2009-03-20T21:31:00.000Z	nacho	stefan_can	go see to compile alsa-ctl... I think that it's another packet

2009-03-20T21:33:00.000Z	nacho	stefan_can	I did it yet... but perhaps I did anything wrong, so go repeat
2009-03-20T21:33:00.000Z	stefan_can	nacho	if you have version 14 you definately did something wrong
2009-03-20T21:34:00.000Z	nacho	stefan_can	sure! ;) thanks
