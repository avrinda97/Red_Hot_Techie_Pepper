2008-05-31T12:56:00.000Z	amirman84		ï»¿is there a reason that openoffice.org and openoffice.org-base aren't installed on ubuntu? should they be? when i try sudo apt-get upgrade in the terminal it says a bunch of openoffice.org packages are being held back,  anyone know what could be wrong?
2008-05-31T12:56:00.000Z	amirman84		i'm thinking that could be it...

2008-05-31T13:02:00.000Z	amirman84		lifeisfunny: soundray: joot: the reason i ask is because my update wont complete because a bunch of openoffice.org packages are being held back. the crazy thing is i dont think those packages were installed by default. all my openoffice.org apps still work.
