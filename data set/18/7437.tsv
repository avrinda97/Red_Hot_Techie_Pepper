2008-04-23T03:41:00.000Z	Zemus		What's with gparted not booting into gnome on more than half the computers I've ever tried it on?
2008-04-23T03:41:00.000Z	proq	Zemus	gparted isn't a bootloader
2008-04-23T03:42:00.000Z	Zemus	proq	so?
2008-04-23T03:42:00.000Z	proq	Zemus	so I don't get what you mean
2008-04-23T03:42:00.000Z	Zemus	proq	gparted is supposed to boot into gnome. Half the time, x fails to initialize.
2008-04-23T03:43:00.000Z	Zemus		Yes, the gparted livecd.
2008-04-23T03:43:00.000Z	Zemus		When I've used it, and it has worked, it boots into a live graphical desktop environment. Gnome.
2008-04-23T03:43:00.000Z	proq	Zemus	it failed to detect the video card or monitor then
2008-04-23T03:43:00.000Z	Zemus		Perhaps it is fluxbox, I just assumed it to be gnome, heh.
2008-04-23T03:43:00.000Z	Zemus		But yeah, it fails to detect the video card or monitor more than half the time.
2008-04-23T03:43:00.000Z	Zemus		Like, I've used it on five or six computers at this point, and it's failed on most of them.
2008-04-23T03:44:00.000Z	Zemus		ahhh, and I just used it on another machine
2008-04-23T03:44:00.000Z	Zemus		"X.org: You need a graphical environment to run GParted. The graphical environment configuration should have been done automatically, Unfortunately it did not since you are back at the bash! So please run Forcevideo Script, and you will be asked for Video Driver and Reslution. VESA driver should always work, and so should 1024x768"
2008-04-23T03:44:00.000Z	proq	Zemus	you don't really *need* gparted though. fdisk works better
2008-04-23T03:44:00.000Z	Zemus		It gives that almost every time. Awesome.
2008-04-23T03:44:00.000Z	Zemus	proq	no, but a lot of the time we need to give it to someone who doesn't know what they're doing and will inevitably make mistakes in a CLI environment.
2008-04-23T03:45:00.000Z	proq	Zemus	it helps to use popular or known-supported hardware in that situation
2008-04-23T03:45:00.000Z	Zemus	proq	yeah. I have nothing but. :P
