2011-02-03T13:27:00.000Z	avinashhm		hi, i migrated to 10.10 recently ,... i am seeing an instability in network .. i observe eth0 goes down suddenly... it is fixed if i do  a reboot of my ubuntu .. is there any way to reset only network .. [ like re enumerate eth0 ]
2011-02-03T13:28:00.000Z	avinashhm		'[43515.967250] e1000e: eth0 NIC Link is Down' is the message i see ..even if n/w is proper
