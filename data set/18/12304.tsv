2007-06-02T09:42:00.000Z	pomalley		i just added 2 gigs of ram to my computer and now ubuntu is running comically slowly. is this a known problem or am i going to have to do some research?
2007-06-02T09:43:00.000Z	bbrazil	pomalley	research I'd say. Howmuch ram do you have total, what's your arch, and what's your workload?
2007-06-02T09:44:00.000Z	pomalley	bbrazil	yeah, that's what i was afraid of. i have 4gb total now, just running feisty x86 (not 64 bit) and this is with no workload (just on boot, and starting gnome)
2007-06-02T09:44:00.000Z	bbrazil	pomalley	that's odd. you're on 686 or later I presume?
2007-06-02T09:45:00.000Z	pomalley	bbrazil	whatever the default that it gives is
2007-06-02T09:45:00.000Z	bbrazil	pomalley	I'm asking about your processor
2007-06-02T09:45:00.000Z	pomalley	bbrazil	oh, yeah, duh. pentium d 950, pretty good.
2007-06-02T09:45:00.000Z	bbrazil	pomalley	is the new ram thesame spec as the existing stuff
2007-06-02T09:46:00.000Z	pomalley	bbrazil	yeah, it's exactly the same as what i already had, just 2 more sticks
2007-06-02T09:46:00.000Z	bbrazil	pomalley	what happens if you remove the old sticks?
2007-06-02T09:47:00.000Z	bbrazil	pomalley	and what happens when you remove the old sticks, and put the new sticks in their slots?
2007-06-02T09:47:00.000Z	pomalley	bbrazil	haven't tried that yet, i just booted once
2007-06-02T09:47:00.000Z	pomalley	bbrazil	xp works fine
2007-06-02T09:47:00.000Z	bbrazil	pomalley	I'd also suggest measuring 'slower'
2007-06-02T09:47:00.000Z	bbrazil	pomalley	ram checks will naturally take more time, so allow for that
2007-06-02T09:48:00.000Z	pomalley	bbrazil	haha ok. but i was even getting errors on various gnome startup things. (like gnome-settings daemon has failed to start, or whatever)
2007-06-02T09:48:00.000Z	bbrazil	pomalley	that sounds like bad ram
2007-06-02T09:48:00.000Z	bbrazil	pomalley	run memtest86, should be a boot option
