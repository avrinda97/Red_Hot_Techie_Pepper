2010-09-24T00:49:00.000Z	GregUK		Hi all. I have a number of web servers in a load balanced cluster. Can anyone suggest a way of replicating users' uploaded files (images) to all servers in the cluster?
2010-09-24T00:49:00.000Z	ikonia	GregUK	rsync
2010-09-24T00:50:00.000Z	GregUK	ikonia	I was thinking something a bit more instantaneous. I'd have to run rsync every minute or something.
2010-09-24T00:50:00.000Z	ikonia	GregUK	then you'd have to have shared storage at a backend
2010-09-24T00:51:00.000Z	ikonia	GregUK	what cluster technology are you using ?
2010-09-24T00:52:00.000Z	ikonia	GregUK	what cluster technology are you using ?
2010-09-24T00:52:00.000Z	GregUK	ikonia	identical nginx web servers behind HAproxy load balancers
2010-09-24T00:52:00.000Z	ikonia	GregUK	what OS are they running ?
2010-09-24T00:52:00.000Z	GregUK	ikonia	all Ubuntu
2010-09-24T00:53:00.000Z	ikonia	GregUK	ubuntu what version
2010-09-24T00:53:00.000Z	GregUK	ikonia	10.04 LTS
2010-09-24T00:54:00.000Z	ikonia	GregUK	your going to have to look at shared backend storage, and something like multimaster ldap services for auth
2010-09-24T00:55:00.000Z	ikonia	GregUK	no, as that would be a single point of failure and make the cluster pointless
2010-09-24T00:56:00.000Z	ikonia	GregUK	if that one server goes down, all your cluster is dead
2010-09-24T00:56:00.000Z	GregUK	ikonia	NFS + DRBD? :)
2010-09-24T00:56:00.000Z	ikonia	GregUK	nope
2010-09-24T00:59:00.000Z	ikonia	GregUK	it's worthless to you unless it can be cross mounted on multiple machines as shared backend storage
2010-09-24T01:04:00.000Z	GregUK	ikonia	thanks for your advice too, I'll take a look into SANs :)
