2011-02-10T23:37:00.000Z	Pici	lcb	kim_bruning: Its much easier to add the user to the 'admin' group on Ubuntu.
2011-02-10T23:44:00.000Z	Pici	lcb	o.O
2011-02-10T23:44:00.000Z	lcb	Pici	as root... don't know if that matters
2011-02-10T23:45:00.000Z	Pici	lcb	Wait.. you ran '!sudo > lcb' on your server?
2011-02-10T23:45:00.000Z	lcb	Pici	yes, and again. indeed reboots
2011-02-10T23:46:00.000Z	Pici	lcb	Thats a command for our bot in this channel to send information about sudo, its not something for you to run.
2011-02-10T23:46:00.000Z	lcb	Pici	no prob about being the serv. isn't a production one or important
2011-02-10T23:47:00.000Z	lcb	Pici	i know :) but i had nothing to do and i tryed that new sudo command :))
2011-02-10T23:47:00.000Z	lcb	Pici	and btw, might be a security issue...
2011-02-10T23:47:00.000Z	Pici	lcb	Its not supposed to be a shell command. '!' has a special meaning on the shell.
2011-02-10T23:49:00.000Z	Pici	lcb	Thats not a security issue.  I didn't tell you to run that in your shell.
2011-02-10T23:49:00.000Z	lcb	Pici	i know, it was not ur fault :)
2011-03-08T00:23:00.000Z	Pici	lcb	Its #ubuntu+1
2011-05-02T18:48:00.000Z	lcb	Pici	thanks, that's why i told to dld desktop...
