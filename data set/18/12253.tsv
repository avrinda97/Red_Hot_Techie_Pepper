2007-01-09T15:42:00.000Z	gh0st		hey, i just wanted to show what fonts ubuntu can show by DEFAULT :-)
2007-01-09T15:42:00.000Z	ikonia	gh0st	that was stupid
2007-01-09T15:42:00.000Z	gh0st	ikonia	don't be to upset about such unimportant things
2007-01-09T15:43:00.000Z	ikonia	gh0st	what flooding the channels
2007-01-09T15:43:00.000Z	gh0st	ikonia	ONE line?
2007-01-09T15:43:00.000Z	ikonia	gh0st	in your client - i have a text based client so it flooeded my whole screan
2007-01-09T15:44:00.000Z	gh0st	ikonia	ok, didn't know that you were using a client last updated in '98
2007-01-09T15:44:00.000Z	ikonia	gh0st	just show consideration
2007-01-09T15:44:00.000Z	gh0st	ikonia	were the fonts displayed or where they replaced by %*" or what ever?
2007-01-09T15:45:00.000Z	ikonia	gh0st	about 100 lines of random chars
2007-01-09T15:45:00.000Z	ikonia	gh0st	roughly
2007-01-09T15:46:00.000Z	gh0st	ikonia	seriously could you make a screenshot? because that would interest me, what other irc clients can display (especially for different fonts)
2007-01-09T15:46:00.000Z	ikonia	gh0st	sorry no, it flooded my screen so has long moved on
2007-02-20T07:18:00.000Z	gh0st	ikonia	how? i would prefer doing in VNC, but it SHOULDB only be on the lan, so no internet etc... is this possbile?
2009-12-09T07:12:00.000Z	ikonia	gh0st	yes
2009-12-09T07:14:00.000Z	ikonia	gh0st	no
