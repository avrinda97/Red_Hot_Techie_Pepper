2008-04-29T17:52:00.000Z	DistroJockey	astro76	my preferred editor was nano but it still used vi
2008-04-29T17:53:00.000Z	astro76	DistroJockey	alado2, really? update-alternatives didn't work for either of you?
2008-04-29T17:53:00.000Z	DistroJockey	astro76	nope, I ran it and it was set to nano
2008-04-29T17:55:00.000Z	DistroJockey	astro76	Hardy install here
2008-04-29T17:55:00.000Z	astro76	DistroJockey	still on gutsy here ;)
2008-04-29T17:56:00.000Z	DistroJockey	astro76	so your visudo can use nano?
2008-04-29T17:57:00.000Z	astro76	DistroJockey	honestly I haven't tried, I use vim ;) but I've helped people set it
2008-04-29T17:57:00.000Z	DistroJockey	astro76	:)
2008-04-29T17:57:00.000Z	DistroJockey	astro76	vim is not exactly newbie friendly (no offense)
2008-04-29T17:58:00.000Z	astro76	DistroJockey	well wait a sec... the default in Ubuntu was always nano, and I always have to change it to vim
2008-04-29T17:58:00.000Z	astro76	DistroJockey	is this clean Hardy install?
2008-04-29T17:58:00.000Z	DistroJockey	astro76	that looks to be the case
2008-04-29T17:58:00.000Z	DistroJockey	astro76	yeah
2008-04-29T18:00:00.000Z	astro76	DistroJockey	it takes practice.... for years I only used basics until I made myself integrate a few new vi commands into my usage every time I used it
2008-04-29T18:00:00.000Z	DistroJockey	astro76	agreed :)
2008-04-29T18:00:00.000Z	astro76	DistroJockey	it's really amazing how quick you can edit without moving your fingers from the keys once you are proficient
2008-04-29T18:01:00.000Z	DistroJockey	astro76	yep
