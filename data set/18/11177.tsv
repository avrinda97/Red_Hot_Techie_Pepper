2009-01-19T21:29:00.000Z	jrib	ye	how did you install it?
2009-01-19T21:30:00.000Z	jrib	ye	Hardware Drivers is only for when you use the repositories.  You're installing software outside the repositories
2009-01-19T21:31:00.000Z	jrib	ye	what card?  Why didn't you use Hardware Drivers originally?
2009-01-19T21:34:00.000Z	jrib	ye	I recommend you just use the repositories

2009-01-19T22:43:00.000Z	jrib	ye	I don't understand why you can't copy and paste and please use "jrib" to trigger my highlight.  Use apt-get to do whatever you were trying to do
2009-01-19T22:43:00.000Z	ye	jrib	well, it's not possible in that application to copy and paste..
2009-01-19T22:45:00.000Z	ye	jrib	dang, its stand something about it needs to have something installed. Like a package
2009-01-19T22:46:00.000Z	jrib	ye	what are you doing exactly?  Use apt-get so you can copy and paste
2009-01-19T22:46:00.000Z	ye	jrib	sorry ill try now :)
2009-01-19T22:48:00.000Z	ye	jrib	http://paste.ubuntu.com/107012/
2009-01-19T22:50:00.000Z	ye	jrib	did u see anything in that?
2009-12-07T05:13:00.000Z	jrib	ye	you wouldn't use nano for that really
2009-12-07T05:15:00.000Z	jrib	ye	well if you want to use bash to delete the contents of a file (THERE IS NO UNDO), you may do:             :> /path/to/file
