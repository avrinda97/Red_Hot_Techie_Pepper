2010-05-02T12:14:00.000Z	lsemple		ok geekphreak I am back on the live CD, however, I don't trust this upgrade or my O/S anymore.. so, I am going to backup my home folder, and try a different OS reinstall from the CD (again...)
2010-05-02T12:16:00.000Z	lsemple		need a more solid o/s
2010-05-02T12:17:00.000Z	lsemple		yeah well, I am sick of reinstalling..
2010-05-02T12:18:00.000Z	stevecam	lsemple	if you want something more solid then maybe you need to build it yourself
2010-05-02T12:18:00.000Z	stevecam	lsemple	what are you looking for in linux?
2010-05-02T12:19:00.000Z	lsemple	stevecam	just stability
2010-05-02T12:20:00.000Z	stevecam	lsemple	do you know your way around bash?
2010-05-02T12:20:00.000Z	lsemple	stevecam	a little, not much thoguh, I just found out about chroot today,
2010-05-02T12:21:00.000Z	stevecam	lsemple	you sound like you would be interested in something like FLS
2010-05-02T12:23:00.000Z	stevecam	lsemple	do you know what LFS is?
2010-05-02T12:24:00.000Z	lsemple	stevecam	no idea
2010-05-02T12:25:00.000Z	stevecam	lsemple	you are going on about how ubuntu isn't stable enough, it's hard to get something working perfect for everybody so if you can learn how to compile a linux system you can make things work for you in your own way
2010-05-02T12:26:00.000Z	lsemple	stevecam	yeah Im just wining,   its these mysterious and extreme problems I seem to run into all the time
2010-05-02T12:26:00.000Z	stevecam	lsemple	haha
2010-05-02T12:28:00.000Z	lsemple	stevecam	I chrooted to hda1, did a apt-get upgrade, and I get "the following packages have been kept back: "
2010-05-02T12:28:00.000Z	lsemple	stevecam	then a huge list of packages
2010-05-02T12:28:00.000Z	lsemple	stevecam	obviously the upgrade didn't complete or work
2010-05-02T12:28:00.000Z	stevecam	lsemple	i dont like doing the upgrades, and don't recommend anyone should run them
