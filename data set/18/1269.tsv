2011-04-16T12:34:00.000Z	Pip	amybunny	You are on ubuntu, why can do anything on linux
2011-04-16T12:34:00.000Z	Pip	amybunny	Why did you use demo ?
2011-04-16T12:34:00.000Z	Pip	amybunny	wait, what exactly do you want to do ?
2011-04-16T12:36:00.000Z	Pip	amybunny	You can't delete a partition that is mounted
2011-04-16T12:38:00.000Z	Pip	amybunny	there is a tool for linux which is almost as powerful as PM
2011-04-16T12:38:00.000Z	Pip	amybunny	GParted is totally "what you see is what you will get"
2011-04-16T12:43:00.000Z	Pip	amybunny	Install what ?
2011-04-16T12:44:00.000Z	Pip	amybunny	You are on Live CD or something ?
2011-04-16T12:46:00.000Z	Pip	amybunny	They are totally different two things
2011-04-16T15:03:00.000Z	Pip	amybunny	what's happening ?
2011-04-16T15:06:00.000Z	amybunny	Pip	im installing the fglrx driver, despite xserver-xorg-video-radeon being installed in the hopes that it clears up video errors
2011-04-16T15:07:00.000Z	amybunny	Pip	video errors: scrolling over the toolbar on the left hand side causes screen flicker, apps like terminal are so heavily tinted they're almost unreadable.
2011-04-16T15:08:00.000Z	Pip	amybunny	Maybe you want to disable KMS
2011-04-16T15:09:00.000Z	amybunny	Pip	how do i do that?

2011-04-16T15:14:00.000Z	Pip	amybunny	You can just put a line "options radeon modeset=0" in your modprobe.conf file
