2007-05-03T08:26:00.000Z	ikonia_	Jayson_	problem with the kernel
2007-05-03T08:26:00.000Z	ikonia_	Jayson_	have you checked your hardware, or made sure your hardware is compatible with the kernel you are running
2007-05-03T08:27:00.000Z	Jayson_	ikonia_	when i running 32bit application aways my kernel crash, my kernel is "Linux jayson-desktop 2.6.20-15-generic #2 SMP Sun Apr 15 06:17:24 UTC 2007 x86_64 GNU/Linux"
