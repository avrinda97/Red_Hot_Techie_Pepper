2005-12-28T07:24:00.000Z	nickrud	gandhii	did you download and burn the install yourself?
2005-12-28T07:24:00.000Z	nickrud	gandhii	then, maybe you could check the md5sum of the iso, it may be bad.
2005-12-28T07:25:00.000Z	nickrud	gandhii	it's an easy check: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/VerifyIsoHowto?highlight=%28iso%29
2005-12-28T07:25:00.000Z	nickrud	gandhii	I've seen really odd things come down to burning too fast
2008-02-09T09:54:00.000Z	nickrud	gandhii	for main, there's a security team that applies known security fixes. For universe and mulitiverse, it's catch as catch can. They're working on building a good team for that, though
2008-02-09T09:56:00.000Z	nickrud	gandhii	precisely. The philosophy is don't add new bugs to a release,
2008-02-09T09:57:00.000Z	nickrud	gandhii	however, gutsy-updates will sometimes get new versions, as does backports and proposed. I personally don't use proposed and backports because they often add new bugs.
