2008-01-01T21:09:00.000Z	Amerio		have a problem with ubuntu , when I choose ubuntu from booting list , the loading logo doesnt show , just the login screen , any ideas?
2008-01-01T21:10:00.000Z	Jowi	Amerio	could be framebuffer
2008-01-01T21:11:00.000Z	Amerio	Jowi	I dont have this problem @ this current pc , but on the laptop because I have vista installed it
2008-01-01T21:12:00.000Z	Jowi	Amerio	I dont understand the problem. Vista is unrelated to Ubuntu boot logo - unless you mean that by installing Vista you no longer have the option to boot Ubuntu.
2008-01-01T21:13:00.000Z	Amerio	Jowi	No , I mean I had Ubuntu Loading logo working fine , but after installing vista , the Loading logo doesnt work
2008-01-01T21:14:00.000Z	Jowi	Amerio	that is very strange indeed. I would be surprised if Vista have modified your BIOS/CMOS settings. anyway, you can try to set the framebuffer resolution (by force it) in the page ubotu said.
2008-01-01T21:19:00.000Z	Amerio	Jowi	what is "Boot-Time Diagnostic Screen" ?
2008-01-01T21:20:00.000Z	Jowi	Amerio	no idea. where do you see that?
2008-01-01T21:20:00.000Z	Amerio	Jowi	im in the Bios menu right now
2008-01-01T21:22:00.000Z	Jowi	Amerio	I haven't encountered that option in any of the BIOS settings I've seen.
2008-01-01T21:23:00.000Z	Jowi	Amerio	unless it's the screen just before boot that list IRQ and connected devices just before Win/DOS  boots
2008-01-01T21:23:00.000Z	Jowi	Amerio	there's usually a help screen in the BIOS settings though that should explain it.
2008-01-01T21:24:00.000Z	Amerio	Jowi	the guide only shows how to disable the frame buffer
2008-01-01T21:24:00.000Z	Amerio	Jowi	but still have the problem
2008-01-01T21:24:00.000Z	Jowi	Amerio	no, it also show how to enter a framebuffer resolution in GRUB.
2008-01-01T21:25:00.000Z	Jowi	Amerio	for example vga=791
2008-01-01T21:54:00.000Z	Jowi	Amerio	turn off the framebuffer. you will see text scroll by instead of the bar. see if you get any error messages or see which service is slow to start. if everything looks ok, set the frame buffer resolution in GRUB as in the link I advised earlier.
2008-01-01T22:12:00.000Z	Amerio	Jowi	I have disabled the frame buffer but nothing is showing up
