2004-12-07T14:37:00.000Z	Shufla	mariam	well. as I see, you need to supply proper password
2004-12-07T14:41:00.000Z	Shufla	mariam	do you have NT-domain there?
2004-12-07T14:42:00.000Z	mariam	Shufla	you said i needed to supply a proper password, but the computer doesn't have a password
2004-12-07T14:43:00.000Z	Shufla	mariam	hm... paste me on priv effect of smbclient -N -L //gagik
2004-12-07T15:08:00.000Z	Shufla	mariam	jiyuu0 : i have no idea. i've solved it once. check the printer configuration. afair if it works under win-boxes with anonymous access it do not have to work same way on ubuntu. try to use user/passwords. check printer permissions on win-boxes... howgh, sorry :(
2004-12-07T15:11:00.000Z	mariam	Shufla	thank you very much for all your support
