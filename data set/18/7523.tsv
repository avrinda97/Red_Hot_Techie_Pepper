2008-11-15T08:54:00.000Z	gkasinath	drog	I vaguely remember doing that. I m sorry I tried so many things, I cant remember now. Lemme go back to the wiki and jog my memory
2008-11-15T09:02:00.000Z	gkasinath	drog	I havent done what was written in : https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HdaIntelSoundHowto, is that what you advised to do?

2008-11-15T09:05:00.000Z	gkasinath	drog	- thanks for that mate. I'll give them a shot and see how it goes.
2008-11-15T09:16:00.000Z	gkasinath	drog	- I m compiling the alsa-driver as per the wiki at the moment. Will let you know how it goes.

2008-11-15T10:08:00.000Z	gkasinath	drog	I m back. The wiki guide was most helpful. I recompiled the alsa driver, lib and utils. That worked!
