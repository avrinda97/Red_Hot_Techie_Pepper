2005-10-12T07:54:00.000Z	PieD		Hi
2005-10-12T07:54:00.000Z	PieD		I've got a problem with my laptop on breezy
2005-10-12T07:54:00.000Z	PieD		that's an Acer aspire 1692 wlmi
2005-10-12T07:54:00.000Z	PieD		and the battery isn't working
2005-10-12T07:55:00.000Z	PieD		a website (http://www.aalbiol.upv.es/ACER.html) shows me that it can be solved by a new DSDT
2005-10-12T07:55:00.000Z	PieD		so I downloaded and compiled one from acpi.sf.net
2005-10-12T07:55:00.000Z	PieD		(the one for my laptop)
2005-10-12T07:55:00.000Z	maku	PieD	means? the battery ststus is not working or the battery has dried out?
2005-10-12T07:55:00.000Z	PieD		I can't get informations about the battery
2005-10-12T07:55:00.000Z	PieD		I don't know whether it's full or empty and so on
2005-10-12T07:56:00.000Z	PieD		I installed the new DSDT following the instructions of the Wiki (https://wiki.ubuntu.com/ACPIBattery)
2005-10-12T07:56:00.000Z	PieD		and yet, when I reboot the computer, it's stopping on "loading ACPI modules"
2005-10-12T07:56:00.000Z	PieD		I edited the script to show its progression
2005-10-12T07:56:00.000Z	maku	PieD	i have toshiba laptop, just booting with default config shows battery status :)
2005-10-12T07:56:00.000Z	PieD		and I see it's freezy on loading ac module
2005-10-12T07:57:00.000Z	PieD	maku	and ?
2005-10-12T07:57:00.000Z	PieD		what is the ac module useful for ?
2005-10-12T07:58:00.000Z	maku	PieD	my toshiba aslo hangs with live cd while loading modules (at 98%), but things work fine in install cd
