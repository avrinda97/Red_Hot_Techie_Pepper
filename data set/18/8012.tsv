2008-01-20T05:02:00.000Z	benny269		im running ubuntu feisty, can someone help me switch off ALL desktop effects and disable beryl by default please?
2008-01-20T05:02:00.000Z	tanath	benny269	without uninstalling it? System > prefs> desktop effects
2008-01-20T05:04:00.000Z	benny269	tanath	yes. when i go to desktop effects it says enable effects, but they are already enabled? and the beryl symbol is in the systray (or whatever linux calls it)
2008-01-20T05:05:00.000Z	tanath	benny269	the icon in the systray should have a right click menu option to disable it
2008-01-20T05:06:00.000Z	tanath	benny269	and beryl has been discontinued, and merged with compiz
2008-01-20T05:06:00.000Z	benny269	tanath	im aware of that but i dont want to upgrade just yet. beryl only offers quit by right click and last time i did this it still loaded on restart. i want everything disabled by defualt.
2008-01-20T05:07:00.000Z	tanath	benny269	ah, you'll have to remove it from your session
2008-01-20T05:07:00.000Z	tanath	benny269	and check which session you're choosing when you log in. choose gnome
2008-01-20T05:07:00.000Z	benny269	tanath	can you walk me through that please? i dont understand most of what you just said
2008-01-20T05:08:00.000Z	tanath	benny269	System > Prefs > Sessions
2008-01-20T05:08:00.000Z	tanath	benny269	remove beryl from startup, and current session
2008-01-20T05:09:00.000Z	tanath	benny269	and save. then when you log in next time. there's an option to choose your session. make sure you're not choosing a session called beryl
2008-01-20T05:11:00.000Z	benny269	tanath	removed beryl but effects are still running
2008-01-20T05:12:00.000Z	tanath	benny269	removed from startup in sessions?
2008-01-20T05:12:00.000Z	tanath	benny269	then it shouldn't start up again next session :)
2008-01-20T05:12:00.000Z	benny269	tanath	great but how do i stop it for right now
2008-01-20T05:12:00.000Z	tanath	benny269	through the systray icon
2008-01-20T05:13:00.000Z	tanath	benny269	if that doesn't work, then log out, and back in
