2009-08-29T18:17:00.000Z	MindVirus1		I recently got a new repository for Firefox and I got 3.5. So I removed the repository and now I want to revert back to 3.0. However, removing firefox-3.5 also removes the firefox meta-package.
2009-08-29T18:17:00.000Z	MindVirus1		Any suggestions?
2009-08-29T18:19:00.000Z	ikonia	MindVirus1	uninstall and re-install fireefox
2009-08-29T18:19:00.000Z	MindVirus1	ikonia	that makes firefox manually selected.
2009-08-29T18:19:00.000Z	ikonia	MindVirus1	yes, that's right
2009-08-29T18:19:00.000Z	ikonia	MindVirus1	but you can re-install the meta package from the main repo
2009-08-29T18:20:00.000Z	ikonia	MindVirus1	no, you "can"
2009-08-29T18:20:00.000Z	MindVirus1	ikonia	only thing: I'd remove firefox-gnome-support.
2009-08-29T18:20:00.000Z	MindVirus1	ikonia	I for sure don't want that as manually installed.
2009-08-29T18:21:00.000Z	ikonia	MindVirus1	why - what different does it make if you're just going to re-install it
2009-08-29T18:21:00.000Z	MindVirus1	ikonia	manually installed means that it won't be removed with autoremove if it's not a dep.
2009-08-29T18:21:00.000Z	ikonia	MindVirus1	it will never be removed - it's a meta package
2009-08-29T18:22:00.000Z	MindVirus1	ikonia	firefox-gnome-support?
2009-08-29T18:22:00.000Z	ikonia	MindVirus1	what about it
2009-08-29T18:22:00.000Z	MindVirus1	ikonia	I would actually like firefox to be manually installed but not firefox-gnome-support.
2009-08-29T18:23:00.000Z	ikonia	MindVirus1	what does it matter - you've messed around with the repos and dependencies, now this is how you'll need to deal with it, or install something that depends on firefox
2009-08-29T18:23:00.000Z	MindVirus1	ikonia	is there any way to install without setting manually installed?
2009-08-29T18:23:00.000Z	ikonia	MindVirus1	no, unless something needs it as a dependency
