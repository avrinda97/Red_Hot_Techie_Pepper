2009-01-24T17:44:00.000Z	nenadsuperzmaj	ubuntuteen	what language are you working in. i know it's not much of an answer, but if it's C, you're better off with Netbeans IMO
2009-01-24T17:45:00.000Z	ubuntuteen		nenadsuperzmaj:i am working in c
2009-01-24T17:45:00.000Z	ubuntuteen	nenadsuperzmaj	can i help me
2009-01-24T17:46:00.000Z	ubuntuteen	nenadsuperzmaj	the problem is that i am unable to see the bulid option in the toobar
2009-01-24T17:46:00.000Z	ubuntuteen		nenadsuperzmaj:and when i unabled some pugins i was able to run but there is problem
2009-01-24T17:46:00.000Z	nenadsuperzmaj	ubuntuteen	try and get netbeans. there is a C only version which is pretty light (10-20 megs I think). I also had troubles with Anjuta, couldn't get it to compile and run programs, but Netbeans worked perfectly for me. You should try it...
2009-01-24T17:47:00.000Z	ubuntuteen	nenadsuperzmaj	say me the command to get it plz
2009-01-24T17:47:00.000Z	ubuntuteen		pc_nerd: is it in windows or ubuntu
2009-01-24T17:48:00.000Z	ubuntuteen		pc_nerd:i know in windowds
2009-01-24T17:49:00.000Z	ubuntuteen	nenadsuperzmaj	plz say me the command
2009-01-24T17:49:00.000Z	nenadsuperzmaj	ubuntuteen	I downloaded it directly from their website, but sudo apt-get install netbeans should do the trick
2009-01-24T17:49:00.000Z	ubuntuteen	nenadsuperzmaj	are u sure that netbeans has c in it beause it is for java
2009-01-24T17:51:00.000Z	nenadsuperzmaj	ubuntuteen	do a search "netbeans" in your Add-Remove section and you'll se the info
