2011-08-12T05:42:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain		my comp is turning off by itself
2011-08-12T05:42:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain		im looking at the system monitor. nothing is out of the ordinary
2011-08-12T05:42:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain		anyone know what would cause my system to do that?
2011-08-12T05:43:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain		this is a desktop
2011-08-12T05:43:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain		it has happened 2 times when im converting music
2011-08-12T05:43:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain		im about to try again to see if it is consistent
2011-08-12T05:44:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain		lol
2011-08-12T05:44:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain		i know your not good enough to hax me ;)
2011-08-12T05:46:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain		i think my cores are overheating
2011-08-12T05:47:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain		both cores are maxing out at 100% usage
2011-08-12T05:47:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	[THC]AcidRain	heh, overheating? unless you OC'd ,your thermal paste is almost non-existant or your fan failed/clogged/slowed down; you'll be fine
2011-08-12T05:48:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain	aeon-ltd	my comp is very clean
2011-08-12T05:48:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	[THC]AcidRain	recent?
2011-08-12T05:48:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain	aeon-ltd	but did you see my message that both cores are maxing out?
2011-08-12T05:48:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	[THC]AcidRain	yes but that's normal
2011-08-12T05:49:00.000Z	[THC]AcidRain	aeon-ltd	what other reasons would my comp just shutdown? perhaps a power surge?
2011-08-12T05:49:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	[THC]AcidRain	shutdown or did it crash first?
2011-08-12T05:50:00.000Z	aeon-ltd	[THC]AcidRain	should be, unless you're rocking sli setups
