2005-10-04T06:34:00.000Z	nalioth	n00bster	use the livecd to change your disk arrangements
2005-10-04T06:37:00.000Z	nalioth	n00bster	working with your hard drives requires they be unmounted
2005-10-05T13:20:00.000Z	nalioth	n00bster	its in your synaptic under "ubuntu-calendar"
2005-10-05T13:23:00.000Z	nalioth	n00bster	synaptic is pretty self explanatory
2005-10-05T13:28:00.000Z	nalioth	n00bster	the file is 2 clicks away
2005-10-05T13:28:00.000Z	nalioth	n00bster	if you dont learn apt-get or synaptic or aptitude, you will soon be in a world of pain
