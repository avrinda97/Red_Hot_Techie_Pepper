2006-05-25T15:52:00.000Z	luisito	ompaul	the system doesn't read it even.
2006-05-25T15:54:00.000Z	ompaul	luisito	well it is possible that you did not sync it before you removed it, that tends to be a bad situation
2006-05-25T15:55:00.000Z	luisito	ompaul	it works well in windows
2006-05-25T15:56:00.000Z	ompaul	luisito	I have no answer for you, other than that menu I suggested.
2006-05-25T15:57:00.000Z	luisito	ompaul	I just think it is because the sda1 file dissapear from /dev. I don't know why that happen. I need somebody to send me that file to correct that issue.
2006-05-25T15:58:00.000Z	ompaul	luisito	/dev is rebuilt every time you reboot,
2006-05-25T15:58:00.000Z	ompaul	luisito	udev is nothing like the old devfs
2006-05-25T15:59:00.000Z	luisito	ompaul	well, then I don't know what da' hell happened
2006-05-25T15:59:00.000Z	luisito	ompaul	thank you, anyway :)
2006-05-25T16:00:00.000Z	ompaul	luisito	plug it into a different socket
2006-05-26T16:01:00.000Z	luisito	ompaul	oh, i did it and now it works!
2006-05-26T16:02:00.000Z	luisito	ompaul	thank you
