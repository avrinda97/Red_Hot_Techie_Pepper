2007-05-26T05:20:00.000Z	non|linear		is there a way i can list all of the applications i have installed?
2007-05-26T05:22:00.000Z	non|linear		umm... like stuff i installed from synaptic, i think i installed some things that I can't find
2007-05-26T05:24:00.000Z	non|linear		ok... how do i unplug my iPod when it says "do not disconnect" and also I lost a drive of music, is there any program i can use to download from my iPod (including filenames and tags etc.)
2007-05-26T05:25:00.000Z	magnetron	non|linear	you should unmount it before you unplug it
2007-05-26T05:27:00.000Z	magnetron	non|linear	i have heard good things about the music player software Rhythmbox and Amarok. there is also a software called gtk-pod
2007-05-26T05:28:00.000Z	non|linear	magnetron	ok, thnx, rythmbox started up when i plugged in, but dragging and dropping didn't work... prolly have to read eh? i think i may be able to use anapod in xp tho
2007-05-26T05:28:00.000Z	magnetron	non|linear	try other ways than drag and drop
2007-05-26T05:29:00.000Z	non|linear	magnetron	k, ill try now
2007-05-26T05:37:00.000Z	non|linear	magnetron	gtkpod should work, thanks! i lost like 40 gigs but should be able to recover 8 from my iPod... that took years to convert or collect all that
2007-05-26T05:38:00.000Z	magnetron	non|linear	it is always important to unmount any drive before removing it. pulling the plug on a drive that the OS is accessing will most probably give you trrouble
2007-05-26T05:39:00.000Z	non|linear	magnetron	OK.  trying toi unmount it now, the device appears as /media/SPYPOD, is the device really SPYPOD and not a drive?
2007-05-26T05:39:00.000Z	magnetron	non|linear	just right click it and choose "unmount"
2007-05-26T05:40:00.000Z	non|linear	magnetron	hrm, ok umount says the drive is not mounted according to mtab, but the ipod says not to disconnect
2007-05-26T05:40:00.000Z	magnetron	non|linear	if you insist on doing it in command line, you may have to use sudo
2007-05-26T05:40:00.000Z	magnetron	non|linear	it is case sensitive, BTW
2007-05-26T05:43:00.000Z	non|linear	magnetron	figured it out, thanks and sorry ;p
2007-05-26T05:45:00.000Z	non|linear	magnetron	ok, when i unmount it, the pod still says NO! and there is no ipod folder in /media, but there is a ipod drive showing in computer (with an option to mount)
2007-05-26T05:46:00.000Z	non|linear	magnetron	LOL, i'm so sorry..... eject, right
