2009-01-31T18:54:00.000Z	savvas	mchelen	you have to: 1) update the links to the PPA archives you use (they have an extra 'ppa') and 2) get the key for each of them
2009-01-31T18:56:00.000Z	savvas	mchelen	I can give you a hand with the updating if you want to
2009-01-31T18:56:00.000Z	mchelen	savvas	that would help, where does the extra ppa go?
2009-01-31T18:59:00.000Z	savvas	mchelen	http://pastebin.com/m444cf2d8 - you can get it with: sudo wget http://pastebin.com/pastebin.php?dl=m444cf2d8 -O /etc/apt/sources.list
2009-01-31T19:00:00.000Z	mchelen	savvas	http://ubuntuforums.org/showpost.php?p=6649356 fixed the GPG error
2009-01-31T19:02:00.000Z	savvas	mchelen	the ppa links you have now will be dropped soon
2009-01-31T19:03:00.000Z	savvas	mchelen	yes, that's step (2) I mentioned before
2009-01-31T19:03:00.000Z	mchelen	savvas	ah ok, thanks
2009-01-31T19:05:00.000Z	savvas	mchelen	you have to update the keys for these: http://paste.ubuntu.com/112076/plain/
2009-01-31T19:07:00.000Z	mchelen	savvas	okay, when will the old ones stop working?
2009-01-31T19:08:00.000Z	mchelen	savvas	http://paste.ubuntu.com/112076/plain/ doesn't seem to work
2009-01-31T19:09:00.000Z	savvas	mchelen	those are the links you have to visit with your browser
2009-01-31T19:10:00.000Z	mchelen	savvas	yah okay, they are all like http://ppa.launchpad.net/project/ppa/ubuntu
2009-01-31T19:10:00.000Z	savvas	mchelen	I have no idea when they will end the old links, this is the email I got: http://paste.ubuntu.com/112078/plain/
2009-01-31T19:12:00.000Z	mchelen	savvas	ok cool, thanks
