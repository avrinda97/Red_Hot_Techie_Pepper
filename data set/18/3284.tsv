2009-11-06T08:46:00.000Z	Amaranth	Paullo_	You still haven't given any details. Repeating yourself like that won't help
2009-11-06T08:51:00.000Z	Amaranth	Paullo_	It sounds like there may be a bug in the nvidia driver then. You're most likely out of luck
2009-11-06T08:52:00.000Z	Paullo_	Amaranth	 and how i solve this?
2009-11-06T08:52:00.000Z	Amaranth	Paullo_	Stop repeating yourself
2009-11-06T08:53:00.000Z	Paullo_	Amaranth	the text is not more on screen
2009-11-06T08:53:00.000Z	Amaranth	Paullo_	But people are already talking to you
2009-11-06T08:56:00.000Z	Amaranth	Paullo_	If going to System->Administration->Hardware Drivers and following the directions does not do the right thing you most likely will not be able to install the nvidia driver at all
2009-11-06T08:56:00.000Z	Amaranth	Paullo_	There is no way to force it to work
2009-11-06T08:57:00.000Z	Paullo_	Amaranth	so my video cant work in linux?
2009-11-06T08:57:00.000Z	Amaranth	Paullo_	It may work in a newer or older version of Ubuntu
2009-11-06T08:58:00.000Z	Paullo_	Amaranth	i try in 8.04,9.04 and 9.10
2009-11-06T08:58:00.000Z	Amaranth	Paullo_	Sounds like it just isn't going to work then, sorry.

2009-11-06T08:59:00.000Z	Amaranth	Paullo_	As I said, it sounds like it just isn't going to work at all
2009-11-06T09:00:00.000Z	Amaranth	Paullo_	As I said, it sounds like it just isn't going to work at all
2009-11-06T09:00:00.000Z	Amaranth	Paullo_	Complain loudly to nvidia
2009-11-06T09:07:00.000Z	Amaranth	Paullo_	The only way to know is to try it yourself
