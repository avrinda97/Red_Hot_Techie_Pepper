2006-06-14T14:57:00.000Z	montbazin		Hi everybody
2006-06-14T14:57:00.000Z	montbazin		I'm with kubuntu on a machine with an ADM Duron processor at 950 Mhz.
2006-06-14T14:57:00.000Z	montbazin		The trouble I encounter is that all applications are very slow while opening, Mainly Openoffice and Skype are causing trouble.
2006-06-14T14:57:00.000Z	montbazin		I have 256 Mo ram
2006-06-14T14:57:00.000Z	montbazin		Is there a way to make this runnin faster
2006-06-14T14:57:00.000Z	AskHL	montbazin	you'll want to use Xubuntu instead of regular Ubuntu. That takes less RAM
2006-06-14T14:58:00.000Z	AskHL	montbazin	errr, instead of Kubuntu I mean
2006-06-14T14:58:00.000Z	AskHL	montbazin	also it's most likely RAM that's your problem and not the processor
2006-06-14T14:59:00.000Z	montbazin	AskHL	do you 512 MO ram will improove the whole thing drastically ?
2006-06-14T15:00:00.000Z	AskHL	montbazin	I believe you can simply do sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop then you'll just have to select the Xfce window manager from the login screen. 512 MB is fine for my laptop (but it also has a much faster processor... I just don't feel any bad caching going on)
2006-06-14T15:01:00.000Z	AskHL	montbazin	I won't GUARANTEE anything but I find it very likely that the low amount of RAM causes constant swapping (it did on my old computer which now usese xubuntu)
2006-06-14T15:02:00.000Z	AskHL	montbazin	try installing xubuntu before you invest in anything expensive
2006-06-14T15:03:00.000Z	montbazin	AskHL	have anoter machine with pentium III and 256Mo and that works much better
2006-06-14T15:04:00.000Z	AskHL	montbazin	hmmm, well, then it might not _only_ be the RAM. But good luck with finding a solution
2006-06-14T15:04:00.000Z	AskHL	montbazin	no problem, hope it suits you.
2006-06-14T15:04:00.000Z	montbazin	AskHL	: thanks
2006-06-14T15:06:00.000Z	montbazin	AskHL	: sorry, a stupid question, is ther a fast way to enter a niknane when writing on x-chat, I always use copy/paste
2006-06-14T15:07:00.000Z	AskHL	montbazin	I use irssi and there <tab> will complete. Seems it should work in X-chat too
