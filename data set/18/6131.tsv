2008-06-26T03:51:00.000Z	zeeq		anyone out there using ubuntu on intel Q6600????
2008-06-26T03:53:00.000Z	cpm	zeeq	what is the problem with your Q6600
2008-06-26T03:53:00.000Z	zeeq	cpm	it shows three CPUs only
2008-06-26T03:53:00.000Z	cpm	zeeq	bizarro
2008-06-26T03:53:00.000Z	cpm	zeeq	sorry there
2008-06-26T04:00:00.000Z	cpm	zeeq	best thing to do is to compile a linux kernel yourself from source
2008-06-26T04:00:00.000Z	cpm	zeeq	that will definetly solve the problem
2008-06-26T04:01:00.000Z	cpm	zeeq	http://www.howtoforge.com/kernel_compilation_ubuntu
2008-06-26T04:02:00.000Z	cpm	zeeq	make sure you enable all appropriate SMP features
2008-06-26T04:02:00.000Z	cpm	zeeq	it shouldn't be too complicated
2008-06-26T04:05:00.000Z	zeeq	cpm	this wiki is for ubuntu 6.0 the kernel was then very older then what we have now
2008-06-26T04:06:00.000Z	cpm	zeeq	the kernel installation procedure has not changed
2008-06-26T04:07:00.000Z	cpm	zeeq	i just read through that and its perfectly applicable to modern distributions
2008-06-26T04:08:00.000Z	zeeq	cpm	sammyF: here is what i see if I put the screenlets of the sysmonitor on...its showing me three CPUs
2008-06-26T04:15:00.000Z	cpm	zeeq	upgrading to 64-bit will cause partial loss of compatibility with 32 bit programs
2008-06-26T04:15:00.000Z	cpm	zeeq	and you will need to install 32 bit libraries to run the 32 bit apps
2008-06-26T04:15:00.000Z	cpm	zeeq	64 bit is more of a headache than you would expect
2008-06-26T04:16:00.000Z	cpm	zeeq	performance improvements are minimal
