2009-08-23T05:58:00.000Z	JSG	Ben64	Why would I be able to ping it but apt-get update fails.
2009-08-23T05:58:00.000Z	Ben64	JSG	no idea, figured you were running an outdated version
2009-08-23T05:59:00.000Z	Ben64	JSG	try "apt-get install imagemagick"
2009-08-23T06:00:00.000Z	JSG	Ben64	nopt. Says it is not available, not referred or missing or obsoleted.
2009-08-23T06:01:00.000Z	JSG	Ben64	if I cant run 'apt-get update' i wont have a up to date list of packages i can install
