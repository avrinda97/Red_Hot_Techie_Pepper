2011-07-08T16:54:00.000Z	l33_		i am trying hard to remasters ubuntu nattty with remastersys, but i am getting initram errors when booting the remastered live cd
2011-07-08T16:54:00.000Z	l33_		how can i install aufs in ubuntu?? is there an easy way??
2011-07-08T16:56:00.000Z	l33_		when compigling kernel with kernelcheck i found an entry in xconfig to enable the sqaush module in kernel, but i cant find an option to enable the aufs module for the new kernel
2011-07-08T16:56:00.000Z	l33_		anyone knows if and where such an option of aufs in xconfig is?
2011-07-08T16:57:00.000Z	ikonia	l33_	you need to look at what's supported in what kernel
2011-07-08T16:57:00.000Z	ikonia	l33_	we don't support custom kernels here
2011-07-08T16:58:00.000Z	ikonia	l33_	that is custom
2011-07-08T16:58:00.000Z	ikonia	l33_	grep the .config file
2011-07-08T16:59:00.000Z	ikonia	l33_	no the kernel .config file
2011-07-08T17:02:00.000Z	ikonia	l33_	depends if you're using supported technologies
2011-07-08T17:03:00.000Z	ikonia	l33_	ok - so why are you complaining it's not working ?
2011-07-08T17:03:00.000Z	ikonia	l33_	this channels for ubuntu support.......remastersys isn't in ubuntu, so no point moaning here
2011-07-08T17:05:00.000Z	ikonia	l33_	you're using a custom kernel, so it doesn't matter what you use
2011-07-08T17:07:00.000Z	ikonia	l33_	what part of "custom kernel" and "not supported" is not clear ?
2011-07-08T17:07:00.000Z	ikonia	l33_	you can use what you want as it won't be supported as you're using a custom kernel
2011-07-08T17:08:00.000Z	ikonia	l33_	I wouldn't be using it unless you know what you're doing, expect the machine to fail and can deal with that
2011-07-08T17:10:00.000Z	ikonia	l33_	that is a wise choice
