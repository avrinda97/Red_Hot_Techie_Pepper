2005-05-23T09:08:00.000Z	REdsz	IIIEars	with the amd64 boards u need to get a list of the components and research them, as things like usb work but things like sata and scsi on tyan k8w isnt fully supported yet
2005-05-23T09:09:00.000Z	REdsz	IIIEars	asus msi abit are fairly popular
2005-05-23T09:10:00.000Z	REdsz	IIIEars	like nforce2 works good tyah tests there boards in linux with there new amd64 nforce3/4 chipset boards, all the nforce stuff seems to have growing support
2005-05-23T09:11:00.000Z	REdsz	IIIEars	amd and via chipsets also arent too bad, just dont pick like sis or ali
2005-05-23T09:12:00.000Z	REdsz	IIIEars	depends wat ur budget is also msi asus abit is good value tyan is expensive
2005-05-23T09:13:00.000Z	REdsz	IIIEars	http://www.tyan.com/products/html/athlon.html the amd-760 chipset has been out a while too
2005-05-23T09:13:00.000Z	REdsz	IIIEars	if u get the latest kernel for 2.6.x u can see wat drivers and support is in there
2005-05-23T09:14:00.000Z	REdsz	IIIEars	nah they make a board  at about $800 is the k8e or k8w my cuzin runs a server
2005-05-23T09:15:00.000Z	REdsz	IIIEars	search around on google theres heaps of stuff, if ur going to use stuff like sata make sure theres support for that chipset and drivers and patches before u get a board
2005-05-23T09:16:00.000Z	REdsz	IIIEars	obviously u pay more for tyan but the features and power does outweigh the others
2005-05-23T09:17:00.000Z	REdsz	IIIEars	if ur to get an nforce based chipset board, then get the nforce4 ultra not just nforce4 http://www.msicomputer.com/product/p_list.asp?class=mb&cpu=3
