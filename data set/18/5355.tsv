2010-08-04T17:32:00.000Z	p0a		holy crap I trashed my system

2010-08-04T17:33:00.000Z	p0a		no that's not it actionParsnip
2010-08-04T17:34:00.000Z	p0a		I don't get the files that were removed
2010-08-04T17:34:00.000Z	p0a		why the fuck couldn't I stop apt-get like I normally do with ^C
2010-08-04T17:34:00.000Z	p0a		when I saw it removing all these
2010-08-04T17:35:00.000Z	p0a		my system probably won't even reboot
2010-08-04T17:35:00.000Z	p0a		lol
2010-08-04T17:35:00.000Z	p0a		libxml2 removed everything
2010-08-04T17:35:00.000Z	p0a		holy fuck
2010-08-04T17:36:00.000Z	Pici	p0a	Please mind your language here.
2010-08-04T17:36:00.000Z	p0a	Pici	unless I get help real fast I don't think I'll care anymore
2010-08-04T17:37:00.000Z	Pici	p0a	Check your /var/log/dpkg.log for what was removed.
2010-08-04T17:38:00.000Z	p0a	Pici	doesn't mention anything
2010-08-04T17:44:00.000Z	Pici	p0a	Not sure if you saw my pm, but check /var/log/apt/history.log or one of the logrotated files depending on how long ago you did it.
2010-08-04T17:45:00.000Z	p0a	Pici	Yeah I saw your PM and checked that file. It mentions all the packages I removed. How could I possibly reinstall them? Do I have to do it by hand?
2010-08-04T17:46:00.000Z	Pici	p0a	Yes, or do a re-install.  Sorry, those are the only options you really have at this point.
2010-08-04T17:54:00.000Z	p0a	Pici	I gathered all the names of the packages in a single file, separated by newline. How can I tell apt-get to install these files?
