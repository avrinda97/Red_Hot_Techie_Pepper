2008-05-03T02:51:00.000Z	prolix		hello
2008-05-03T02:52:00.000Z	prolix		does 8.04 install within windows?
2008-05-03T02:52:00.000Z	sebsebseb	prolix	 yes 8.04 can be installed inside WIndows, but it is best to use the old/standard way  and partition the hard disk
2008-05-03T02:53:00.000Z	sebsebseb	prolix	after all think about it what if Windows screws up, Ubuntu screws up then to?
2008-05-03T02:53:00.000Z	prolix	sebsebseb	well, i have debian on another partition, but i'd like the flexibility of a *nix o.s. when i'm on the winders side
2008-05-03T02:53:00.000Z	sebsebseb	prolix	  Wubi will install it inside Windows yes, but  you carn't use it when your inside Windows if you install it with Wubi
2008-05-03T02:54:00.000Z	prolix	sebsebseb	?
2008-05-03T02:54:00.000Z	sebsebseb	prolix	wubi is just a way to put  Windows on your hard disk instead of it having it's own partitions,  and so by using your Windows partition
2008-05-03T02:54:00.000Z	sebsebseb	prolix	if you want to run WIndows and Ubuntu at the same time, well then your after a virtual machine
2008-05-03T02:56:00.000Z	sebsebseb	prolix	 Cygwin is basically a Linux shell emulater than can run some programs
2008-05-03T02:56:00.000Z	sebsebseb	prolix	 andlinux is a bit like WIne really except it's on WIndows and for running Linux apps
2008-05-03T02:56:00.000Z	prolix	sebsebseb	i use cygwin, as a matter of fact that's how i'm here now
2008-05-03T02:56:00.000Z	sebsebseb	prolix	 you can run a real  Ubuntu installation inside WIndows inside a virtual machine
2008-05-03T02:57:00.000Z	prolix	sebsebseb	thank you, and the others who helped.
2008-05-03T02:57:00.000Z	sebsebseb	prolix	 check  this out  :)  http://www.virtualbox.org :)

2008-05-03T02:58:00.000Z	sebsebseb	prolix	you can also run already made VMware virtual machines in virtualbox
2008-05-03T02:58:00.000Z	sebsebseb	prolix	 yes for examle an already made Ubuntu virtual machine that is in the VMware format will run in virtualbox
