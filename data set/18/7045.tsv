2008-02-16T20:00:00.000Z	sarah		Hello. I'm having some problems with Amarok in Ubuntu. If I try launching it I just get the splash screen and nothing else. Can someone help me?
2008-02-16T20:01:00.000Z	prince_jammys	sarah	also type in terminal "amarok" to see if there's any error messages that might help find the prob
2008-02-16T20:10:00.000Z	prince_jammys	sarah	Bodsda apparently that message is normal for amarok startup --- according to the internet, and my amarok install on KDE
2008-02-16T20:11:00.000Z	sarah	prince_jammys	But it should be able to start up anyway, shouldn't it?
2008-02-16T20:11:00.000Z	prince_jammys	sarah	Bodsda right --- but the error message is standard
2008-02-16T20:17:00.000Z	prince_jammys	sarah	Bodsda:: one thing to try--> sudo apt-get install libxine-extracodecs
2008-02-16T20:17:00.000Z	sarah	prince_jammys	giving that a shot
2008-02-16T20:18:00.000Z	sarah	prince_jammys	It says that version isn't available, but that libxine1-ffmpeg
2008-02-16T20:18:00.000Z	sarah	prince_jammys	... replaces it
2008-02-16T20:19:00.000Z	prince_jammys	sarah	strange
2008-02-16T20:19:00.000Z	sarah	prince_jammys	Exactly the swame problem. Amarok SHOULD work even though I'm using gnome, right?
2008-02-16T20:19:00.000Z	prince_jammys	sarah	yes
2008-02-16T20:20:00.000Z	prince_jammys	sarah	ubuntu version?
2008-02-16T20:20:00.000Z	sarah	prince_jammys	: 7.10
2008-02-16T20:24:00.000Z	prince_jammys	sarah	Bodsda ok so that package is not the issue --- saw that on the web, related to this problem
2008-02-16T20:25:00.000Z	sarah	prince_jammys	Bodsda : Problem found!
2008-02-16T20:25:00.000Z	sarah	prince_jammys	Bodsda: I have no idea how it happened, but my ~/.kde library had become u-w'ed
2008-02-16T20:26:00.000Z	prince_jammys	sarah	ah - well good
