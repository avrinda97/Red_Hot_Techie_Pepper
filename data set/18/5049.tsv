2008-12-23T15:01:00.000Z	hashbrowns		I can't boot to windows xp pro x64 after installing ubuntu 8.10 64-bit version.  After grub starts to load my windows installation, my windows installation says "NTLDR is missing" and I have not choice to but to restart my computer.
2008-12-23T15:02:00.000Z	dr_willis	hashbrowns	 ntldr is a windows boot file.  You sure you dident accidently format your windows installs?  You coudl try booting a windows rescue/boot/install cd and use the fixboot command.
2008-12-23T15:03:00.000Z	hashbrowns	dr_willis	will that touch my data on my windows partition?  I'm pretty sure I didn't format my windows partition, just resized it.
2008-12-23T15:04:00.000Z	dr_willis	hashbrowns	 booting windows install cd. and running its rescue/fixmbr or fixboot commands will  copy/write the proper files to the windows partition.
2008-12-23T15:04:00.000Z	dr_willis	hashbrowns	 fixboot / fixmbr may or  may not make linux unbootabe then - due to grub being removed
2008-12-23T15:08:00.000Z	hashbrowns	dr_willis	then I'd be in a rather bad scenario because this NTLDR missing problem arose from a fresh install of GRUB.
2008-12-23T15:09:00.000Z	dr_willis	hashbrowns	 i dont see how grub installing would remove a FILE from the windows drive..    grub instlls to the MBR of the disk.
2008-12-23T15:09:00.000Z	dr_willis	hashbrowns	 last i saw ntldr missing was hd curruption on windows.
2008-12-23T15:10:00.000Z	hashbrowns	dr_willis	okay well I'll give it a go.  Hopefully it doesn't make ubuntu unbootable.
2008-12-23T15:10:00.000Z	dr_willis	hashbrowns	 if you overwrite the MBR it will remove grub.. You will need to restore the grub boot loader some how.
2008-12-23T15:11:00.000Z	dr_willis	hashbrowns	  I forget what the exact commands are for Vista, vs XP to fix all this.. one fixes the boot files.. another does the MBR
2008-12-27T16:25:00.000Z	dr_willis	hashbrowns	 basic trouble shooting.. Can you ping the router, can you ping a web site based on its ip, but not its name?  tell the channel the results of those 2 tests
2008-12-27T16:26:00.000Z	hashbrowns	dr_willis	I can ping the router, but no websites
2008-12-27T16:26:00.000Z	dr_willis	hashbrowns	 ping google.com    vs   ping 74.125.45.100                  If the first fails and the 2nd works.. = dns issues Most likely
2008-12-27T16:28:00.000Z	hashbrowns	dr_willis	both of those pings failed
2008-12-27T16:28:00.000Z	dr_willis	hashbrowns	 this is a wired or wireless network?
2008-12-27T16:29:00.000Z	dr_willis	hashbrowns	 if both fail. Hmm. that sounds like the gateway/default route  is not set proplery on the machine.
2008-12-27T16:29:00.000Z	hashbrowns	dr_willis	well the router that i go through is wired and the machine is wired but there is a wireless portion of the lan im on
