2007-08-26T09:17:00.000Z	foxray		does ubuntu use iptables or selinux? i can't ssh into my other linux box
2007-08-26T09:18:00.000Z	Enselic	foxray	can you ping the other box?
2007-08-26T09:18:00.000Z	foxray	Enselic	yes i can ping the other box
2007-08-26T09:18:00.000Z	Enselic	foxray	is sshd running on the other box?
2007-08-26T09:18:00.000Z	foxray	Enselic	ssh_exchange_identification: Connection closed by remote host
2007-08-26T09:18:00.000Z	foxray	Enselic	yes it is running
2007-08-26T09:18:00.000Z	Enselic	foxray	have you customized sshd_config a lot?
2007-08-26T09:19:00.000Z	foxray	Enselic	this ip is in hosts.allow
2007-08-26T09:20:00.000Z	Enselic	foxray	any particular reason you base authenticatin on hosts.allow?
2007-08-26T09:20:00.000Z	foxray	Enselic	no reason i thought the other ip was blocked but it isn't
2007-08-26T09:21:00.000Z	Enselic	foxray	so, did you change sshd_config alot?
2007-08-26T09:21:00.000Z	Enselic	foxray	it seems to me as if you messed up sshd_config
2007-08-26T09:23:00.000Z	foxray	Enselic	i got it working now, careful when u have the same username on both boxes, sshd doesn't like that
2007-08-26T09:23:00.000Z	Enselic	foxray	it works perfectly fine with me
2007-08-26T09:24:00.000Z	Enselic	foxray	I have martin everywhere
2007-08-26T09:24:00.000Z	foxray	Enselic	my sshd_config file is a little more restrictive
2007-08-26T09:25:00.000Z	Enselic	foxray	really, sshd have no way of knowing the clients username anyway
2007-08-26T09:25:00.000Z	Enselic	foxray	afaik    i.e. it should not matter what the username on the client box is
