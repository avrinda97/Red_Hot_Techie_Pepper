2011-12-14T07:17:00.000Z	travisHAZE		Is there a command to kill every running process without shutting the pc down?
2011-12-14T07:19:00.000Z	travisHAZE		It is, isn't it sokak?
2011-12-14T07:21:00.000Z	travisHAZE		Better yet: Is there a good document thats pretty all-inclusive on learning Linux?
2011-12-14T07:21:00.000Z	travisHAZE		Like A-Z and 0 - 392845091785230
2011-12-14T07:22:00.000Z	travisHAZE		Hell, why start at 0?
2011-12-14T07:22:00.000Z	travisHAZE		the man pages help me learn how to use a command
2011-12-14T07:22:00.000Z	travisHAZE		It doesn't tell me all of the commands
2011-12-14T07:22:00.000Z	evildaemon	travisHAZE	all of the commands? compgen -c -f
2011-12-14T07:22:00.000Z	evildaemon		Or tab twice.
2011-12-14T07:24:00.000Z	travisHAZE		OK so theres a start: the commands
2011-12-14T07:24:00.000Z	travisHAZE		Probably the biggest part
2011-12-14T07:24:00.000Z	travisHAZE		How about if I wanted to design my own program?
2011-12-14T07:25:00.000Z	evildaemon		Learn python.
2011-12-14T07:25:00.000Z	travisHAZE		Baby steps are a good idea
2011-12-14T07:25:00.000Z	travisHAZE		But even a baby needs a hand to hold
2011-12-14T07:25:00.000Z	travisHAZE		So where can I find this proverbial hand to hold?
2011-12-14T07:26:00.000Z	evildaemon		Also travisHAZE, you can press tab twice.
2011-12-14T07:26:00.000Z	travisHAZE	evildaemon	got that one
