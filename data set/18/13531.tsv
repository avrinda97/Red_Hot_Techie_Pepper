2006-05-27T11:25:00.000Z	blargh		is there a way to get wifi working without initially having internet access in linux (so no apt-get access)?
2006-05-27T11:27:00.000Z	blargh		c'mon and help a blargh out :c) hehe
2006-05-27T11:28:00.000Z	cdubya	blargh	what is it you're trying to do/
2006-05-27T11:28:00.000Z	blargh	cdubya	get wifi working
2006-05-27T11:29:00.000Z	cdubya	blargh	and your interface got picked up ok?
2006-05-27T11:29:00.000Z	blargh	cdubya	i need a way to install the drivers first.. that doesnt make use of the internet (since I only have wifi access) hehe
2006-05-27T11:29:00.000Z	cdubya	blargh	ouch
2006-05-27T11:30:00.000Z	blargh	cdubya	'ouch' doesnt sound good hehe..
2006-05-27T11:30:00.000Z	cdubya	blargh	heh
2006-05-27T11:31:00.000Z	cdubya	blargh	I've been fortunate to have it picked up on all the installs I've done without installing any drivers......so it was cake
2006-05-27T11:31:00.000Z	blargh	cdubya	i should point out I have wifi working in windows.. so if i need to download something.. i can.. just not while in ubuntu
2006-05-27T11:37:00.000Z	cdubya	blargh	so does the card need ndiswrapper.....?
2006-05-27T11:37:00.000Z	blargh	cdubya	i dunno.. the card needs something.. lol
2006-05-27T11:37:00.000Z	blargh	cdubya	ubuntu doesnt detect it on ifconfig
2006-05-27T11:37:00.000Z	cdubya	blargh	and it's not in /etc/network/interfaces?
