2007-04-13T12:13:00.000Z	octoberdan		Every so often parts of gnome freeze. I'm running edgy and everything's updated. The bars at the top and bottom freeze or stop responding to clicks
2007-04-13T12:13:00.000Z	octoberdan		right now just the bottom went, right after an MPlayer crash
2007-04-13T12:14:00.000Z	octoberdan		Anyone have an idea what might be going wrong? Or know how I can restart gnome without closing out all my apps?
2007-04-13T12:14:00.000Z	Shafto	octoberdan	Ive had that problem on a gentoo install, Turned out to be my wireless mouse XD
2007-04-13T12:14:00.000Z	octoberdan	Shafto	haha, weird..
2007-04-13T12:15:00.000Z	octoberdan	Shafto	How would you recover from it? Just restart?
2007-04-13T12:15:00.000Z	Shafto	octoberdan	Well in the end I switched to XFCE and a wired mouse, not a problem since
2007-04-13T12:19:00.000Z	octoberdan	Shafto	What do you like about XFCE that gnome didn't have?
2007-04-13T12:19:00.000Z	octoberdan	Shafto	I'm considering changing window managers
2007-04-13T12:19:00.000Z	Shafto	octoberdan	Runs alot faster for me tbh
2007-04-13T12:21:00.000Z	octoberdan	Shafto	Did you install just XFCE or xubuntu-desktop?
2007-04-13T12:21:00.000Z	Shafto	octoberdan	If i was you id get xubuntu-desktop
2007-04-13T12:22:00.000Z	octoberdan	Shafto	How come?
2007-04-13T12:22:00.000Z	Shafto	octoberdan	Comes nice and customised with lots of preinstalled software
2007-04-13T12:24:00.000Z	octoberdan	Shafto	Thanks for the tips, I'll give it a shot
2007-04-13T12:25:00.000Z	Shafto	octoberdan	:D
