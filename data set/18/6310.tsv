2009-04-25T00:11:00.000Z	nephish		hey all, i am having a samba problem.
2009-04-25T00:12:00.000Z	nephish		i am having a samba problem. i have an ubuntu box with 2 samba share folders, my macbook can see them, my xbmc can see them, my other two ubuntu computers cannot. ( all ubuntu on Jaunty ).. when i explore the network in nautilus, it gets as far as workgroup
2009-04-25T00:13:00.000Z	harpreet	nephish	you'll have to connect those two ubuntu to the network (proper network name please) by default it comes to "workgroup"

2009-04-25T00:14:00.000Z	nephish	harpreet	they are connected to the Lan, how do i connect them to the workgroup?
2009-04-25T00:16:00.000Z	harpreet	nephish	explain how they are connected to the lan? did you install 9.04 on them and just connected them through a router or hub? or you checked your lan settings: such as workgroup name or domain name etc?
2009-04-25T00:18:00.000Z	nephish	harpreet	well, i just installed them the regular way, already on the lan, they are found by dhcp, is this what you meant? they can get on the internet, ping other computers etc..
2009-04-25T00:19:00.000Z	harpreet	nephish	did you install smbclient on both of them?
2009-04-25T00:20:00.000Z	harpreet	nephish	did you install smbclient on both of them?
2009-04-25T00:21:00.000Z	harpreet	nephish	did you install smbclient on both of them?
2009-04-25T00:22:00.000Z	nephish	harpreet	yes installed smbclient
2009-04-25T00:23:00.000Z	harpreet	nephish	you should be able to connect to your samba share with proper username then
2009-04-25T00:33:00.000Z	nephish	harpreet	new info,  the error i am getting is 'fail to retreive share list from server' but i tried by specifing the share, and it worked. so, just the exploring or discovery aspect is missing
2009-04-25T00:36:00.000Z	harpreet	nephish	can you check if you are using same "computer names" on the network or are they different?
2009-04-25T00:39:00.000Z	harpreet	nephish	then it might be a bug
2009-04-25T00:48:00.000Z	harpreet	nephish	this might help you

2009-04-25T00:53:00.000Z	nephish	harpreet	thanks for the link, my prob is different i think, but that link had a command that when i ran it ( findsmb ) it showed my two share folders, so, i know it can at leaset find them.  may just set it up in fstab since i seem to be able to find it
