2011-08-21T13:34:00.000Z	Waldir		could anyone please help me? I can't understand this boot error :(
2011-08-21T13:36:00.000Z	whoppergator	Waldir	can you mount the disk file from a linux live cd? at least then you could try and recover your data prior to reinstall
2011-08-21T13:37:00.000Z	Waldir	whoppergator	what I need is about 2 dozen google chrome tabs I had open :( do you think that's written to the disk somewhere?
2011-08-21T13:38:00.000Z	whoppergator	Waldir	:( most likely, but it is probably going to be very hard to recover and then insert into a new install
2011-08-21T13:39:00.000Z	Waldir	whoppergator	I don't mind, I really need that list of sites, cause I can't get to all of them from memory
2011-08-21T13:40:00.000Z	whoppergator	Waldir	maybe if you were able to recover the entire cache dir and copy it into exactly the same place in a new install? this is why i use a real partition as opposed to wubi
2011-08-21T13:40:00.000Z	Waldir	whoppergator	this is a netbook, I was only using it for serious work because iI was travelling :/
2011-08-21T13:41:00.000Z	Waldir	whoppergator	I'll try to find that
2011-08-21T13:42:00.000Z	whoppergator	Waldir	yup. i completely sympathize. let me know if you need more. i don't know how the wubi disk file works in windows, but i imagine some sort of loop mounting would be the place to start
2011-08-21T13:42:00.000Z	Waldir	whoppergator	loop mounting?
2011-08-21T13:43:00.000Z	whoppergator	Waldir	that's how you mount a file like it is a disk partition
2011-08-21T13:44:00.000Z	whoppergator	Waldir	my thoughts: mount windows drive, find disk file, loop mount, hunt for chrome cache location on google, copy to safe place, reinstall
2011-08-21T13:45:00.000Z	Waldir	whoppergator	I recall I once used a program that was able to mount ext2 partitions in windows. not sure if they updated it to ext3
2011-08-21T13:46:00.000Z	whoppergator	Waldir	ext3 and 4 are backwards compatible
2011-08-21T13:47:00.000Z	whoppergator	Waldir	however, windows cannot loop mount that i am aware
2011-08-21T13:48:00.000Z	whoppergator	Waldir	ya, or you can use a live cd, copying would take a while
2011-08-21T13:49:00.000Z	Waldir	whoppergator	I am trying with a live usb cause the netbook doesn't take cds :/
2011-08-21T13:49:00.000Z	whoppergator	Waldir	:P that will work too...
