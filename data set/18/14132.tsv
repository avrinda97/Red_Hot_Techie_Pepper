2006-06-16T11:20:00.000Z	terrapen		I've been on *BSD
2006-06-16T11:20:00.000Z	terrapen		chris, I was 21 at the time
2006-06-16T11:20:00.000Z	terrapen		I started using Linux in early 1994...SLS distro, IIRC
2006-06-16T11:21:00.000Z	terrapen		i had to walk with a stack of floppies to the campus computer lab and download the images and then use rawrite to write them to floppy :)
2006-06-16T11:21:00.000Z	terrapen		and then, inevitably, some of the floppies would be bad and I'd have to walk back to the lab
2006-06-16T11:21:00.000Z	terrapen		and to get my CD-ROM working, I had to edit kernel header files to change the I/O port and IRQ assignments :)
2006-06-16T11:22:00.000Z	terrapen		and now, 12 years later, I'm sitting here and Ubuntu tells me that there's a new kernel image available
2006-06-16T11:22:00.000Z	terrapen		I'm like, WRF
2006-06-16T11:22:00.000Z	terrapen		err WTF
2006-06-16T11:23:00.000Z	terrapen		so anyway, I have Ubuntu installed on this laptop...so, why did it talk me into updating to a server kernel (and thus, losing my wireless drivers)?
2006-06-16T11:24:00.000Z	KanRiNiN	terrapen	do you use ndiswrapper?
2006-06-16T11:24:00.000Z	KanRiNiN		who makes the chipset
2006-06-16T11:24:00.000Z	terrapen	graft	the little update manager in Xfce...honestly though, this is all voodoo to me.  I'm from the era where you downloaded kernel patches from Linus's personal server in Finland
2006-06-16T11:25:00.000Z	terrapen		troy, I installed Ubuntu desktop and then that silly update manager told me that there was a kernel image update available (server) and like a dumbass, I installed it
2006-06-16T11:25:00.000Z	terrapen		troy, in what file does ubuntu know whether I'm "Server" or "Desktop"?
2006-06-16T11:25:00.000Z	terrapen	graft	kind of hard to without networking :)
2006-06-16T11:26:00.000Z	terrapen	graft	yeah seriously....maybe I'll set Xorg up by hand and write some Modelines :P{
2006-06-16T11:26:00.000Z	KanRiNiN	terrapen	who makes the chipset?
