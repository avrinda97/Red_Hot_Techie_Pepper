2009-05-28T07:46:00.000Z	lakotajames		How does ssh work?  I need help.  I have openssh-server installed, don't know what to do next.
2009-05-28T07:46:00.000Z	Flannel	lakotajames	connect to your machine from an ssh client!
2009-05-28T07:47:00.000Z	Flannel	lakotajames	(maybe port forward if you need to on your router)
2009-05-28T07:47:00.000Z	Flannel	lakotajames	From another linux machine? from windows? what?
2009-05-28T07:48:00.000Z	Flannel	lakotajames	ssh user@host (host is likely an IP)
2009-05-28T07:49:00.000Z	lakotajames	Flannel	ok, thanks.  now, how do I know my ip address?  It's going to be lan, so whatsmyip.net will show me the wrong thing, right?
2009-06-14T04:53:00.000Z	Flannel	lakotajames	e17 isn't stable yet, so its not in the repos
2009-06-27T11:53:00.000Z	lakotajames	Flannel	yes.
2009-06-27T11:50:00.000Z	Flannel	lakotajames	php doesn't run as a daemon.  What are you tryng to accomplish?
2009-06-27T11:51:00.000Z	lakotajames	Flannel	 I don't know what I am doing.  All I know is that I remember turning it off at somepoint, and it doesn't work right now.  If I recall correctly, it was a terminal based app, and it wasn't just for php, you used it for a lot of stuff.
2009-06-27T11:52:00.000Z	lakotajames	Flannel	I can not remember why I turned it off.
2009-06-27T11:52:00.000Z	Flannel	lakotajames	Alright.  Where are you trying to use it currently? with apache?
2009-06-27T11:54:00.000Z	Flannel	lakotajames	Alright, uh, do you have libapache2-mod-php5 installed?
2009-06-27T11:55:00.000Z	lakotajames	Flannel	 I don't know what I have installed.  All I know is that It used to work,  I no longerneeded it, and turned it off without uninstalling anything.  Now I need it again, and don't remember where I turned it off.
2009-06-27T11:56:00.000Z	Flannel	lakotajames	alright, you might've done: `sudo a2dismod php5` and then to reverse that you do: sudo a2enmod php5
2009-06-27T11:57:00.000Z	lakotajames	Flannel	It was a appy thingy.  It gave a list of stuff, and php was on it, and I deselected it.  It wasn't a single line that did something.
2009-06-27T11:57:00.000Z	Flannel	lakotajames	I unfortunately have absolutely no idea what you're talking about
2009-06-27T11:58:00.000Z	lakotajames	Flannel	 oh.  I could be mistaken.
