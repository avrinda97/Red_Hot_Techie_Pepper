2008-08-24T01:41:00.000Z	Sagi22	ompaul_	I've read it
2008-08-24T01:43:00.000Z	Sagi22		it is possible to load ntldr in a primary partition with grub, then ntldr will load winxp in logical partition?
2008-08-24T01:43:00.000Z	ompaul_		!dualboot
2008-08-24T01:44:00.000Z	Sagi22	ompaul_	thanks for the links but I read it already
2008-08-24T01:44:00.000Z	Sagi22		nothing there about my problem
2008-08-24T01:45:00.000Z	ompaul_	Sagi22	if windows is installed then installing ubuntu second should *just work*
2008-08-24T01:45:00.000Z	Sagi22	ompaul_	but I saw that it's impossible to load logical partition as OS
2008-08-24T01:46:00.000Z	Sagi22		it's windows failure
2008-08-24T01:46:00.000Z	Sagi22		not grub
2008-08-24T01:46:00.000Z	ompaul_	Sagi22	then that is a windows problem
2008-08-24T01:46:00.000Z	Sagi22		but maybe I can do something with grub
2008-08-24T01:46:00.000Z	Sagi22		I have my ntldr in primary
2008-08-24T01:46:00.000Z	Sagi22		so I can load it with grub?
2008-08-24T01:46:00.000Z	Sagi22		and ntldr will load my XP that appear in other partition
2008-08-24T01:47:00.000Z	Sagi22		so I have small partition only for ntldr...
2008-08-24T01:48:00.000Z	ompaul_	Sagi22	my suggestion does not answer your question, back up your data with a live CD, install windows from scratch and then install ubuntu no other ideas
2008-08-24T01:49:00.000Z	Sagi22	ompaul_	I backup anyway but I prefer to use current installs
