2009-09-18T11:43:00.000Z	krejustin1979		What's the newest kernel for ubuntu?
2009-09-18T11:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	krejustin1979	^
2009-09-18T11:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	krejustin1979	try using ./ at the start of the file and use tab completion
2009-09-18T12:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	krejustin1979	try: gksudo nautilus
2009-09-18T12:04:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	krejustin1979	you can then move it with GUI
2009-09-18T12:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	krejustin1979	there is no one best kernel
2009-09-18T12:07:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	krejustin1979	the kernel you have via updates is known to be good and steady, depends what you mean by best
2009-09-18T12:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	krejustin1979	they are all equal
2009-09-18T12:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	krejustin1979	none are better or best, or we'd all use it
2009-09-18T12:30:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	krejustin1979	best is an opinion so can never be concrete
2009-09-18T12:31:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	krejustin1979	there are hundreds of distros other than those 3
2009-09-18T12:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	krejustin1979	try it, see how you like it
2009-09-18T12:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	krejustin1979	uname -a
2009-09-18T12:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	krejustin1979	its the arch of te OS that dictates what you install
2009-09-18T12:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	krejustin1979	you need to look at wat your cpu is, you will be able to run 32bit on both 64 and 32bit CPUs, 32bit is limited to about 3GbR RAM
2009-09-18T12:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	krejustin1979	its offtopic here, this is support
