2009-03-20T03:31:00.000Z	daryl_		hey everyone, wondering if I can ask for a hand? Trying to install ubuntu on an industrial tablet pc. no keys or mouse. each stock or graphic problem install i try gives me a pulsing blank screen half way through the live cd loading on the progress bar. No way to F_ key out of it to a console. I am oj with linux but I dont know things well enough to know how to pass a vga=normal argument at the boot prompt. Tried but I dont kn
2009-03-20T03:31:00.000Z	daryl_		ow root target, it errored. elive gave a desktop when i saw vga=normal go by. Can someone tell me what the boot command would be for jaunty alpha 6?
2009-03-20T03:33:00.000Z	bernz	daryl_	do you mean that the (sort of) "boot menu" from a live CD isn't coming up? or have you already installed a system to the NV storage on the tablet (HD, SSD, or whatever)?
2009-03-20T03:34:00.000Z	bernz	daryl_	in the latter case, you should install GRUB, and then you can configure it to give you a chance to break in during boot and select stuff; among that stuff is the ability to modify kernel options prior to boot
2009-03-20T03:35:00.000Z	bernz	daryl_	oh.. are you trying to figure out how you will be sure that 'vga=normal' is part of the kernel call?
2009-03-20T03:38:00.000Z	bernz	daryl_	well, if you can be sure that you can boot from a USB stick or CDROM or whatever, even after you've installed, you can just mount the file system of the fresh install in your "live" (USB or CD) session, make your edits to the startup config, and then try a boot; if that fails, you can retry until you get it
2009-03-20T03:39:00.000Z	bernz	daryl_	by "pulsing screen", do you mean the orange "ping-pong" progress meter, with "ubuntu" above in round letters?
2009-03-20T03:40:00.000Z	daryl_	bernz	cant get live cd to work yet. install gave same pulsing screen i cant get around. no I mean a terrible looking screen that moves in and out of beige in a 30 second cycle repeating
2009-03-20T03:41:00.000Z	bernz	daryl_	erm..well... this *is* ubuntu, right? if it's "desktop" version, it should allow you to specify extra options at the "pre-boot" screen (a menu that includes an option to test RAM, test the CD, etc -- can you get that screen?)
2009-03-20T03:42:00.000Z	bernz	daryl_	oh.. beige.. hmm... at that point, text consoles are not working? (CTRL-ALT-F1, etc)
2009-03-20T03:42:00.000Z	bernz	daryl_	in any case, do you get to the "pre-boot" menu? at that point, are you not able to specify extra options for the kernel?
2009-03-20T03:45:00.000Z	bernz	daryl_	ahh.. okay, let me look that up, i might be able to just tell you
2009-03-20T04:13:00.000Z	daryl_	bernz	unfortunately the kernel argument vga=normal did not work on my webdt366. i must have missed something. i have been a suse guy since 8.2. only startred using ubuntu very recently. very impressive. does ubuntu offer the ability to convert an existing installation to an ubuntu system? say i can get elive installed. if i put is the ubuntu cd will it offer to convert all settings in to a jaunty?
2009-03-20T04:17:00.000Z	bernz	daryl_	i don't know of any install-converter for ubuntu
2009-03-20T04:18:00.000Z	bernz	daryl_	too bad that kernel arg didn't work, but say -- have you tried kubuntu? it worked on my laptop which otherwise had problems with many other distros (including "straight" ubuntu)
2009-03-20T04:20:00.000Z	bernz	daryl_	well, i don't know much about the kernel yet, but i could believe that it's "legal" to have a variable name without a value (like 'failsafemode'[=nothing])
2009-03-20T04:23:00.000Z	bernz	daryl_	if you can avoid windows mobile like the plague, do it. it is total malware. :-D
2009-03-20T04:24:00.000Z	bernz	daryl_	i only say so because my work is using winmob as a "platform" and i've witnessed it lock-up in a mission-critical situation (DOH!)
