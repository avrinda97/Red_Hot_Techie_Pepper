2011-12-24T05:25:00.000Z	studentrob		is there a website that will tell you all the domains registered with a given registrar?
2011-12-24T05:25:00.000Z	Seveas	studentrob	no
2011-12-24T05:25:00.000Z	studentrob	Seveas	no you dont know of one or no there definitely isnt one
2011-12-24T05:25:00.000Z	Seveas	studentrob	the latter.
2011-12-24T05:25:00.000Z	studentrob	Seveas	whys that
2011-12-24T05:26:00.000Z	Seveas	studentrob	because registrars don't provide that information
2011-12-24T05:26:00.000Z	studentrob	Seveas	but whois has it
2011-12-24T05:27:00.000Z	Seveas	studentrob	sure, and TLD owners can probably tell you which domains in that TLD a registrar has. They don't though and you'd still need to collect it from all TLD's
2011-12-24T05:28:00.000Z	studentrob	Seveas	what do you mean collect from the TLDs
2011-12-24T05:28:00.000Z	studentrob	Seveas	isnt a TLD just the extension like .com .org
2011-12-24T05:29:00.000Z	Seveas	studentrob	"whois" querys the TLD owner to get registrar information. These TLD owners will tell you "given domain X, this is the info" they won't give you "Given registrar Y, these are all registerered comains"
2011-12-24T05:30:00.000Z	Seveas	studentrob	yes, it's the TLD is the extension. Each TLD is owned/managed by a single entity. E.g. verisign manages .com
2011-12-24T05:30:00.000Z	studentrob	Seveas	gotcha .. do u think whois.com pays those entities to do the queries?
2011-12-24T05:31:00.000Z	Seveas	studentrob	neh
2011-12-24T05:31:00.000Z	studentrob	Seveas	I wonder why/how whois.com has an API that they charge people for if you can just use CLI
2011-12-24T05:32:00.000Z	Seveas	studentrob	they don't seem to charge for whois lookups, just for registration
2011-12-24T05:33:00.000Z	studentrob	Seveas	o wait.. i was looking at http://whoisxmlapi.com/
