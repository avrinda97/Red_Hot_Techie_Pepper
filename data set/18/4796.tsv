2009-02-07T19:34:00.000Z	jrib	VZ	so now figure out which part is failing
2009-02-07T19:12:00.000Z	jrib	VZ	use synaptic for example
2009-02-07T19:14:00.000Z	VZ	jrib	yes. but i can not run synaptic success.
2009-02-07T19:14:00.000Z	jrib	VZ	why...?
2009-02-07T19:15:00.000Z	VZ	jrib	it show the error message. All done, no errors.
2009-02-07T19:16:00.000Z	jrib	VZ	erm.  What happens when you type "gksu synaptic" in a terminal?
2009-02-07T19:20:00.000Z	jrib	VZ	pastebin /var/lib/dpkg/info/msttcorefonts.prerm
2009-02-07T19:25:00.000Z	VZ	jrib	#!/bin/sh
2009-02-07T19:30:00.000Z	jrib	VZ	paste.ubuntu.com, not here
2009-02-07T19:30:00.000Z	VZ	jrib	oh, sorry.
2009-02-07T19:32:00.000Z	VZ	jrib	http://paste.ubuntu.com/115221/
2009-02-07T19:35:00.000Z	jrib	VZ	actually, pastebin the full output you got with the error
2009-02-07T19:44:00.000Z	VZ	jrib	http://paste.ubuntu.com/115225/ this is the output when i run the command 'sudo apt-get remove msttcorefonts'
2009-02-07T19:46:00.000Z	jrib	VZ	is line 44 output from something else?
2009-02-07T19:47:00.000Z	VZ	jrib	no, it is all the output of the command.
2009-02-07T19:48:00.000Z	VZ	jrib	i don't know why it should down the exe files.
2009-02-07T19:48:00.000Z	jrib	VZ	seems like it's trying to download the files again but they aren't available and the fonts aren't registered anymore.  I would just put "exit 0" as your 3rd line and then remove the garbage manually (the stuff the .prerm script is doing)
2009-02-07T20:00:00.000Z	VZ	jrib	msttcorefonts has removed. thanks.
