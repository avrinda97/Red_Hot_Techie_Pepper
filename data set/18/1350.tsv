2011-03-17T01:20:00.000Z	Samuel2		i noticed win7 creates a 100 mb partition for its boot stuff
2011-03-17T01:20:00.000Z	Samuel2		ext3 but i still can change it to 4 if thats better
2011-03-17T01:21:00.000Z	Samuel2		its more that i wonder where Grub gets installed, current i got the 100 mb partition, my win7 partition and my empty ext3 part.
2011-03-17T01:22:00.000Z	Samuel2		only got the ext3 partition so far, I think Ubuntu deals with creating the extra partion when needed
2011-03-17T01:24:00.000Z	Samuel2		basicly my question is: can i remove the 100mb boot partition created by Win7 after installing Ubuntu?
2011-03-17T01:25:00.000Z	saulus	Samuel2	dont do that. Windows is a f****g b***h with this
2011-03-17T01:26:00.000Z	saulus	Samuel2	why want you do that?
2011-03-17T01:27:00.000Z	saulus	Samuel2	Partition has nothing to do with disk space!
2011-03-17T01:28:00.000Z	saulus	Samuel2	The question is: How many primary partitions have you running? Windows wants the first two. Then there are two left. In each of them you can create an extended partition which give you 4 logic partitions each
2011-03-17T01:29:00.000Z	Samuel2	saulus	I got 2 for windows indeed and 1 ext3 and one 100GB ntfs partition for just data and such
2011-03-17T01:30:00.000Z	saulus	Samuel2	remove the ext3 and create an extended. Then put in there a 30GB for the linux / (root), remaining space - RAM for your /home, RAM-sized for swap. Thats it.
2011-03-17T01:31:00.000Z	saulus	Samuel2	use gparted
2011-03-17T01:32:00.000Z	saulus	Samuel2	just boot your liveCD and run it. Its on the cd.
2011-03-17T02:19:00.000Z	saulus	Samuel2	/home/ just a regular fs like ext-4 and for swap choose swap
2011-03-17T02:34:00.000Z	saulus	Samuel2	you tell the installer during setup (manual partitioning)
2011-03-17T02:42:00.000Z	saulus	Samuel2	Win is installed already?
2011-03-17T02:42:00.000Z	saulus	Samuel2	You're installing on /dev/sda? Then choose this for grub,
2011-03-17T02:44:00.000Z	saulus	Samuel2	sda
