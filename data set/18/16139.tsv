2005-04-23T06:01:00.000Z	Burgundavia	queuetue	it uses esound
2005-04-23T06:02:00.000Z	queuetue	Burgundavia	how does that get started?
2005-04-23T06:02:00.000Z	Burgundavia	queuetue	they attempted to replace esound with polypaudio but there were too many bugs and corner cases that couldn't be worked out
2005-04-23T06:02:00.000Z	Burgundavia	queuetue	it should start by default
2005-04-23T06:02:00.000Z	queuetue	Burgundavia	Any idea how it starts automatically?
2005-04-23T06:03:00.000Z	Burgundavia	queuetue	never dug to find out. I suspect the default gnome session
2005-05-01T05:43:00.000Z	Burgundavia	queuetue	you need gstreamer-plugins
2005-05-01T05:43:00.000Z	Burgundavia	queuetue	which will get all the codecs/plugins you need
2005-05-01T05:44:00.000Z	queuetue	Burgundavia	It says already installed.  (trying to play xm radio online via firefox, usubng (I believe) totem plugin)
2005-05-01T05:45:00.000Z	Burgundavia	queuetue	then get totem-xine and the w32codecs
2005-05-01T05:45:00.000Z	queuetue	Burgundavia	Already installed.
2005-05-01T05:46:00.000Z	Burgundavia	queuetue	then it should work
2005-05-01T05:46:00.000Z	queuetue	Burgundavia	It doesn't ... What else could be missing?
2005-05-01T05:46:00.000Z	Burgundavia	queuetue	confirmed totem-xine and w32codecs?
2005-05-01T05:48:00.000Z	queuetue	Burgundavia	Yes, I have.
2005-05-01T05:48:00.000Z	Burgundavia	queuetue	hmm, odd
2005-05-01T05:58:00.000Z	Burgundavia	queuetue	vlc and xine are popular
2005-05-01T06:13:00.000Z	Burgundavia	queuetue	borked choices in gnome
