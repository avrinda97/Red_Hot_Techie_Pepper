2005-12-07T06:47:00.000Z	opnsrc		Ok I figured out what's wrong
2005-12-07T06:47:00.000Z	opnsrc		When I run Kanotix (or other distributions of linux) and I extract firefox from firefox-1.5.tar.gz to the firefox directory
2005-12-07T06:47:00.000Z	opnsrc		there is a file called firefox
2005-12-07T06:48:00.000Z	opnsrc		Now normally I can double click that file and it runs perfectly
2005-12-07T06:48:00.000Z	opnsrc		But under Ubuntu it asks me if I want to run it, display or run in terminal
2005-12-07T06:48:00.000Z	opnsrc		No matter what I click it doesn't run
2005-12-07T06:48:00.000Z	opnsrc		sorry
2005-12-07T06:49:00.000Z	opnsrc		so how do I make it run?
2005-12-07T06:49:00.000Z	_jason	opnsrc	you followed everything in the wiki guide correct?
2005-12-07T06:50:00.000Z	_jason	opnsrc	what error?
2005-12-07T06:50:00.000Z	_jason	opnsrc	oh you are just asking about that functionality in nautilus, let me see if I can find that option
2005-12-07T06:51:00.000Z	_jason	opnsrc	in nautilus, edit _> preferences -> behavior.  Under "Executable Text Files" change that to run when clicked
2005-12-07T06:54:00.000Z	_jason	opnsrc	this would stop it from asking you.  You should follow the wiki to get firefox to work.  The wiki guide basically sets up you profile directory correctly and makes the firefox command run the new version.
2005-12-07T06:56:00.000Z	_jason	opnsrc	it runs fine for me.  Try running that command in a terminal and see what it says.
2005-12-07T06:58:00.000Z	_jason	opnsrc	./firefox
2005-12-07T07:01:00.000Z	_jason	opnsrc	yw... dinner time now, cya
2005-12-08T12:16:00.000Z	_jason	opnsrc	nautilus-open-terminal
2005-12-08T12:16:00.000Z	_jason	opnsrc	it's a package you can isntall that will do that
