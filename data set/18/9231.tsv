2007-04-26T10:03:00.000Z	EvaLuaTe		So, has the desktop version of ubuntu have a LiveCD (boot from cd) option ?
2007-04-26T10:03:00.000Z	Pici	EvaLuaTe	Yes, the desktop cd is a live C
2007-04-26T10:03:00.000Z	Pici	EvaLuaTe	D
2007-08-24T06:05:00.000Z	Pici	EvaLuaTe	ls -l
2007-08-24T06:06:00.000Z	EvaLuaTe	Pici	i mean all files, not just for the current user
2007-08-24T06:07:00.000Z	Pici	EvaLuaTe	Ah. find /path -group groupname
2007-08-24T06:09:00.000Z	Pici	EvaLuaTe	Okay.  find has an argument to search for files by group owner.  So, if you wanted to find all files owned by group 'Pici' you could do: sudo find / -group Pici
2007-08-25T16:32:00.000Z	Pici	EvaLuaTe	/etc/motd.tail actually
2007-08-25T16:34:00.000Z	Pici	EvaLuaTe	man motd.tail for information. It explains it better than I can.
2007-08-25T16:35:00.000Z	Pici	EvaLuaTe	What version of Ubuntu are you on?
2007-08-25T16:35:00.000Z	EvaLuaTe	Pici	7.04 server
2007-08-25T16:36:00.000Z	Pici	EvaLuaTe	Odd: The  initiation script /etc/init.d/bootmisc.sh prepends a line containing information about the  system  to  /etc/motd.tail  and  stores  the resulting  file  in  /var/run/motd.  /etc/motd  is  a  symbolic link to /var/run/motd (the system can not assume /etc to be writable).
2007-08-25T16:36:00.000Z	Pici	EvaLuaTe	If /etc/motd.tail doesnt exist, just use /etc/motd like normal
2007-12-31T23:00:00.000Z	Pici	EvaLuaTe	What is oom kill?
2007-12-31T23:00:00.000Z	EvaLuaTe	Pici	http://mirsi.home.cern.ch/mirsi/oom_kill/index.html
2007-12-31T23:03:00.000Z	Pici	EvaLuaTe	I don't see any package like that in the Ubuntu repositories.
2007-12-31T23:04:00.000Z	EvaLuaTe	Pici	i know, also i didn't find any download link for it.
2007-12-31T23:04:00.000Z	Pici	EvaLuaTe	moomps *might* do what you want
