2009-02-18T23:56:00.000Z	bn43	MrNatas	hi the repositories(where u get ur updates from) don't necessarily have the latest, cutting edge version of software
2009-02-18T23:56:00.000Z	MrNatas		oh ok, so how do i update that?
2009-02-18T23:57:00.000Z	bn43	MrNatas	if you really need it, then u have to either get the deb packages of the software, or compile it yourself
2009-02-18T23:58:00.000Z	MrNatas		ye I tried, but I need Qt4 or something to compile it, but cant install that..
