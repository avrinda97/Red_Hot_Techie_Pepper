2012-09-06T20:16:00.000Z	scubes13		how would I display the keyboard shortcut for the Application Menu on a desktop (from the command line)?
2012-09-06T20:16:00.000Z	scubes13		trying now using gconftool-2 - but can't seem to find the entry
2012-09-06T20:16:00.000Z	scubes13		user changed their shortcut, trying to figure out what it is
2012-09-06T20:17:00.000Z	actionParsnip	scubes13	do you have the desktop in front of you?
2012-09-06T20:17:00.000Z	actionParsnip	scubes13	ahhh, I'd ask in #compiz too
2012-09-06T20:18:00.000Z	actionParsnip	scubes13	you could run ubuntu-tweak via forwarded X and set stuff
2012-09-06T20:18:00.000Z	actionParsnip	scubes13	or myunity
2012-09-06T20:19:00.000Z	actionParsnip	scubes13	ubuntu configures X forwarding enabled by default, very handy
2012-09-06T20:19:00.000Z	actionParsnip	scubes13	as in fallback?
2012-09-06T20:20:00.000Z	actionParsnip	scubes13	Unity is a shell for Gnome, so they are booting in to Gnome
2012-09-06T20:21:00.000Z	actionParsnip	scubes13	you can run:  gnome-control-center      after you connect with an X forward enabled session and change the setting
2012-09-06T20:22:00.000Z	scubes13	actionParsnip	- not sure how to run xforward session.. and I am attached via vpn
2012-09-06T20:22:00.000Z	actionParsnip	scubes13	ssh -X username@server     instead of:  ssh username@server
2012-09-06T20:22:00.000Z	actionParsnip	scubes13	notice the X is capitalized
2012-09-06T20:25:00.000Z	actionParsnip	scubes13	if you connect in that manner, you can run GUI apps and they will run on the server side but show on the client (much like Citrix does). Its slow over WWW but works
2012-09-06T20:25:00.000Z	actionParsnip	scubes13	its the same as being on the local system too so you will be manipulating the settings of the user you run the command with
2012-09-06T20:26:00.000Z	scubes13	actionParsnip	- andâ€¦ can this be done from a mac? (i'm running 10.8.1 on this machine)
2012-09-06T20:26:00.000Z	actionParsnip	scubes13	I'd imagine so, Does Mac have an X server. I've not used it much. I can't stand MacOS
