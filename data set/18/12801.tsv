2006-11-11T11:06:00.000Z	skreet		Anyone using NetworkManager?
2006-11-11T11:07:00.000Z	skreet		if you run it from a terminal you'll be able to see any errors that occur.
2006-11-11T11:09:00.000Z	skreet		So no one is using NetworkManager to manage their wireless connection?
2006-11-11T11:10:00.000Z	abes	skreet	i am using networkmanager
2006-11-11T11:10:00.000Z	skreet	abes	Did you have any problems viewing your wireless network?
2006-11-11T11:10:00.000Z	abes	skreet	what kind of problem?
2006-11-11T11:10:00.000Z	skreet	abes	Mine is showing only Wired Network (disconnected) and I have eth1 installed and working *using it right now*
2006-11-11T11:10:00.000Z	abes	skreet	ive had the same problem :] 
2006-11-11T11:10:00.000Z	skreet	abes	And you fixed it..?
2006-11-11T11:11:00.000Z	abes	skreet	what happened is it stopped showing all wi-fis, right?
2006-11-11T11:11:00.000Z	skreet	abes	It didn't stop, it never started, just installed it.
2006-11-11T11:11:00.000Z	abes	skreet	make sure you have a proper driver for your wi-fi adapter
2006-11-11T11:11:00.000Z	abes	skreet	most likely it is in restricted-modules
2006-11-11T11:12:00.000Z	skreet	abes	What do you mean by that, it's working right now.
2006-11-11T11:12:00.000Z	skreet	abes	I'm using the wireless device to talk to you :)
2006-11-11T11:12:00.000Z	skreet	abes	But NetworkManager doesn't recognise it.
2006-11-11T11:13:00.000Z	abes	skreet	how about system-administration-networking? does it show it there?
2006-11-11T11:13:00.000Z	abes	skreet	and why do you use network manager? is it i cuz of WPA?
