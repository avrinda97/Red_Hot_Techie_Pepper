2007-07-03T06:51:00.000Z	mavsman4457		Is there any way to install a kernel in the live cd or kboot and get the original kernel from the live cd onto my ubuntu without having to reinstall ubuntu altogether?
2007-07-03T06:51:00.000Z	mavsman4457		or get*
2007-07-03T06:52:00.000Z	ShackJack	mavsman4457	sudp aptitude install linux-generic
2007-07-03T06:53:00.000Z	mavsman4457	ShackJack	same question as above
2007-07-03T06:53:00.000Z	ShackJack	mavsman4457	Can't you select recovery mode from GRUB?
2007-07-03T06:53:00.000Z	mavsman4457	ShackJack	how do I do that?
2007-07-03T06:55:00.000Z	ShackJack	mavsman4457	From grub menu - either sleect recovery mode or select an older kernel (if you havent dleeted them)
2007-07-03T06:56:00.000Z	mavsman4457	ShackJack	How do I get to the GRUB menu?  What can I do in recovery mode?
2007-07-03T06:56:00.000Z	ShackJack	mavsman4457	Just boot up you should se it... If not -> http://odzangba.wordpress.com/2007/03/10/how-to-restore-grub-using-the-ubuntu-live-cd/
2007-08-05T06:46:00.000Z	ShackJack	mavsman4457	No not really...
2007-08-05T06:46:00.000Z	ShackJack	mavsman4457	Stick with SNES emulation :)
2007-08-05T06:46:00.000Z	mavsman4457	ShackJack	there aren't any good N64 emulators for Linux?
2007-08-05T06:47:00.000Z	ShackJack	mavsman4457	Dunno... but  wouldn't expect them to run appreciably faster..
2007-08-05T06:47:00.000Z	ShackJack	mavsman4457	there's mupen not sure how good
2007-08-05T06:48:00.000Z	mavsman4457	ShackJack	do you know what I could do to my PC hardware wise to speed up the emulation? add more ram?
2007-08-05T06:48:00.000Z	ShackJack	mavsman4457	No, that is mostly a matter of graphical and CPU horsepower unfortunately...
2007-08-05T06:49:00.000Z	mavsman4457	ShackJack	so I would probably need a new graphics card or a new processor altogether?
2007-08-05T06:50:00.000Z	ShackJack	mavsman4457	I don't know what your processor is, but I have a p4 2.4 ghz and 1GB and good graphics and it's still not quite perfect :)
