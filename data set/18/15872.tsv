2005-01-15T15:16:00.000Z	sensebend		that's kinda a loaded question
2005-01-15T15:17:00.000Z	sensebend		enable the repositories
2005-01-15T15:17:00.000Z	sensebend		for the most part they are anyways
2005-01-15T15:17:00.000Z	sensebend		I don't think vmware is in the repos though
2005-01-15T15:19:00.000Z	sensebend		aokaze, go to settings, repositories
2005-01-15T15:19:00.000Z	sensebend		and check all of them
2005-01-15T15:19:00.000Z	sensebend		then reload
2005-01-15T15:19:00.000Z	sensebend		and get whatever you want
2005-01-15T15:20:00.000Z	sensebend		and some contain software that isn't included for patent reasons
2005-01-15T15:20:00.000Z	sensebend		like restricted formats like mp3
2005-01-15T15:21:00.000Z	aokaze	sensebend	 what was that for?
2005-01-15T15:21:00.000Z	sensebend	aokaze	apes was asking why universe and multiverse were not enabled by default
2005-01-15T15:22:00.000Z	sensebend		strange, I didn't know vmware was in portage
2005-01-15T15:22:00.000Z	sensebend		dunno how they did that with the license
2005-01-15T15:22:00.000Z	sensebend		cedega is open, afaik, if you compile it yourself
2005-01-15T15:22:00.000Z	sensebend		I thought VMWare was closed proprietary software
2005-01-15T15:23:00.000Z	sensebend		ah, I see
2005-01-15T15:24:00.000Z	aokaze	sensebend	aokaze, go to settings, repositories .... that is what I am talking about.... I didnt ask anything but I got an answer that I dont know what to do with lol
