2010-10-13T21:07:00.000Z	appleseed		Something has been gradually eating up my main disk space the past week, how can I see which processes are writing to the disk atm?
2010-10-13T21:08:00.000Z	Ceno3x	appleseed	iotop might be a good bet
2010-10-13T21:08:00.000Z	Ceno3x	appleseed	there's some more advanced tricks you can do if that doesn't work
2010-10-13T21:31:00.000Z	appleseed	Ceno3x	ok I think I've found the problem with my diskspace being gradually eaten away, it's the ~/.gvfs folder content. When I try to ls or access that folder the shell hangs, is there a way to move .gvfs to another disk or something?
2010-10-13T21:32:00.000Z	Ceno3x	appleseed	 hmm.what do you mean exactly my disckspace being gradually eaten away? does .gfvs grow a lot in size over the weeks? over a couple of minutes?
2010-10-13T21:33:00.000Z	appleseed	Ceno3x	about 100MB extra a day, and I only have 850MB left
2010-10-13T21:34:00.000Z	Ceno3x	appleseed	wow, let me check how big mine is
2010-10-13T21:34:00.000Z	Ceno3x	appleseed	mine is empty.
2010-10-13T21:35:00.000Z	Ceno3x	appleseed	yeah, have you checked what's in that folder?
2010-10-13T21:37:00.000Z	appleseed	Ceno3x	actually I have a bazillion pdf's and browsers and shells and kate sessions active so I can't logout atm; i've been suspending to ram the past 30 days
2010-10-13T21:38:00.000Z	Ceno3x	appleseed	yeah, I pulled one of those 30days recently. I just asking you to check what files were in the folder, maybe you can recognize something and see what's going on
2010-10-13T21:38:00.000Z	appleseed	Ceno3x	i'll muster up the courage to logout and get back to you, thx =)
2010-10-13T21:39:00.000Z	Ceno3x	appleseed	dude, I was just saying like open nautilus and go the folder, no logout needed
2010-10-13T21:40:00.000Z	appleseed	Ceno3x	no it seems logout is necessary, both ls and nautilus stalls when trying to access .gvfs
2010-10-13T21:40:00.000Z	Ceno3x	appleseed	oh boy O_O
2010-10-13T21:42:00.000Z	appleseed	Ceno3x	oh wait, haha, there it goes, .gvfs is empty afterall; back to the drawing board
2010-10-13T21:43:00.000Z	Ceno3x	appleseed	in accessories you have the disk usage analyzer, would this be of any help?
2010-10-13T21:44:00.000Z	appleseed	Ceno3x	with ls ~/.gvfs it now says: ls: cannot access .gvfs/movies on foreign-pc: Input/output error ---- Ah, I actually have a stalled copy process going from said foreign-pc, one of those that you just cannot seem to kill...
