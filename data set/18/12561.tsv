2008-07-21T00:07:00.000Z	nickrud	jramsey	what version of ubuntu are you running?
2008-07-21T00:07:00.000Z	nickrud	jramsey	not firefox, ubuntu ;)
2008-07-21T00:08:00.000Z	jramsey	nickrud	6.06 dapper
2008-07-21T00:09:00.000Z	nickrud	jramsey	3.0 isn't available from any dapper repo, you'll have to use the one from mozilla, or maybe find a 3d party source for a deb
2008-07-21T00:10:00.000Z	nickrud	jramsey	yes, it's in 8.04
2008-07-21T00:10:00.000Z	jramsey	nickrud	quick way to upgrade to 8.04?

2008-07-21T00:14:00.000Z	jramsey	nickrud	will upgrade now; txs
2008-07-21T00:14:00.000Z	nickrud	jramsey	back up your data prior to upgrade, just a good general rule
2008-07-21T00:15:00.000Z	nickrud	jramsey	if you have no desire to save old data, do a fresh install of 8.04
2008-07-21T00:16:00.000Z	jramsey	nickrud	upgrade whines about enabling universe; i thought i did
2008-07-21T00:17:00.000Z	nickrud	jramsey	seriously, if you have zero data that you want to preserve, I'd strongly suggest a fresh install
2008-07-21T00:17:00.000Z	jramsey	nickrud	i just don't want to lose the record of all the pkgs i installed for the past 2yrs
2008-07-21T00:18:00.000Z	nickrud	jramsey	(between you me and the lamppost, I _always_ do fresh installs with that and some custom stuff I preserve from /etc)
2008-07-21T00:24:00.000Z	jramsey	nickrud	install on the way ... hopefully i will be back soon; txs for ur help
2008-07-21T00:25:00.000Z	nickrud	jramsey	heh. See you in a few days <runs>
