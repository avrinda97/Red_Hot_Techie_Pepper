2012-10-08T00:09:00.000Z	snollux		but that doesn't mean someone could hack apache2 and get access to my root account?
2012-10-08T00:09:00.000Z	gordonjcp	snollux	apache drops root privs pretty quickly after startup
2012-10-08T00:09:00.000Z	snollux		thanks
2012-10-08T00:10:00.000Z	snollux		that makes me feel better, thanks
2012-10-08T00:10:00.000Z	gordonjcp	snollux	I don't want to sound like a condescending dick here, but the way it all goes together is pretty complicated and unless you *really* want to get into it, just sit tight and believe it works ;-)
2012-10-08T00:11:00.000Z	gordonjcp	snollux	it's worth digging into a little, in much the same way that it's worth knowing *why* you check the oil in your car as well as *how* you check it
2012-10-08T00:11:00.000Z	snollux	gordonjcp	I believe you; I'm more used to the slackware/archlinux thing where I set up accounts manually, etc
2012-10-08T00:12:00.000Z	snollux		so it's hard for me to sit and "just believe" sometimes  -- so I'll learn about it more
2012-10-08T00:12:00.000Z	gordonjcp	snollux	it's the same in Arch
2012-10-08T00:12:00.000Z	snollux		is it now? it's been like 4 years since I set up a server there
2012-10-08T00:12:00.000Z	snollux		I remember doing adduser http or something
2012-10-08T00:12:00.000Z	gordonjcp	snollux	yeah, it's the same in pretty much any distro
2012-10-08T00:13:00.000Z	gordonjcp		ah, that's something different
2012-10-08T00:13:00.000Z	gordonjcp	snollux	same principle though; you start as root and drop privs
2012-10-08T00:13:00.000Z	snollux		thanks for all the info, and you're definitely not coming across as condescending -- just helpful
2012-10-08T00:13:00.000Z	gordonjcp	snollux	the Unix API is fun!
2012-10-08T00:14:00.000Z	gordonjcp	snollux	you're always you, except when you're pretending to be someone else
2012-10-08T00:14:00.000Z	gordonjcp	snollux	and of course sometimes you're you but lying about being someone else ;-)
