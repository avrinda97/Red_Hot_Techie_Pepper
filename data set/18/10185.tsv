2007-05-21T05:11:00.000Z	cactaur		Hello. For some reason, my swap is not being reported.
2007-05-21T05:11:00.000Z	xtknight	cactaur	your swap file ?
2007-05-21T05:11:00.000Z	cactaur	xtknight	well, in conky, it says there is no swap. When I try "swapon -s", No files are reported.
2007-05-21T05:12:00.000Z	xtknight	cactaur	conky? sounds familiar but i cant remember what that is
2007-05-21T05:12:00.000Z	cactaur	xtknight	It's a system monitoring program
2007-05-21T05:13:00.000Z	xtknight	cactaur	ah okay so you don't have a swap enabled, basically?
2007-05-21T05:13:00.000Z	xtknight	cactaur	does typing "sudo swapon /dev/sdx" fix the problem?
2007-05-21T05:14:00.000Z	cactaur	xtknight	oh, yeah, thanks
2007-05-21T05:15:00.000Z	cactaur	xtknight	I'm also looking for a way to identify the UUID of the swap. I tried "vol_id" and it didn't give me one.
2007-05-21T05:15:00.000Z	xtknight	cactaur	 try "blkid"
2007-05-21T05:15:00.000Z	cactaur	xtknight	that didn't work either
2007-05-21T05:15:00.000Z	xtknight	cactaur	ls -al /dev/disk/by-uuid
2007-05-21T05:16:00.000Z	cactaur	xtknight	the only ones I get are hda4 and hda2, my linux partitions, not my swap.
2007-05-21T05:16:00.000Z	xtknight	cactaur	do you see your swap partition in "sudo fdisk -l" as "Linux Swap"?
2007-05-21T05:17:00.000Z	cactaur	xtknight	and ardya: Yes it is reported as Linux swap.
2007-05-21T05:17:00.000Z	xtknight	cactaur	reboot to refresh the UUID cahce
2007-05-21T05:21:00.000Z	cactaur	xtknight	nope, still no UUID.
2007-05-21T05:21:00.000Z	xtknight	cactaur	hrmm that's odd.  well you don't /need/ a UUID for swap   i'm not sure why it's not appearing, thouhg
