2008-04-29T11:09:00.000Z	microwaver		My laptop just starts up very slow, i've got a black screen for several minutes. Anyone know what the issue on that is?
2008-04-29T11:10:00.000Z	sdrawkcab	microwaver	using 7.10?
2008-04-29T11:11:00.000Z	microwaver	sdrawkcab	Yes.
2008-04-29T11:13:00.000Z	sdrawkcab	microwaver	I had this issue a long while ago and I fixed it by killing the splash screen which is not a very elegant solution...basically the problem is that the splash screen is not the right resolution so you either need to kill it or edit the config file...there are several threads about it in ubuntu forums
2008-04-29T11:14:00.000Z	microwaver	sdrawkcab	Thanks, another friend of mine said somethin about hte splash screen as well.
2008-04-29T11:14:00.000Z	microwaver	sdrawkcab	i'll google it.

2008-04-29T11:40:00.000Z	sdrawkcab	microwaver	sound never worked well in 7.10 on my new laptop
2008-04-29T11:41:00.000Z	microwaver	sdrawkcab	SOund is working alright. It's the brighness adapter. can't do it with fn + up keys anymore, just by adusting gthe config file.
2008-04-29T11:42:00.000Z	sdrawkcab	microwaver	  weird, i don't know anything about that!
2008-04-29T11:42:00.000Z	microwaver	sdrawkcab	blame it on the cheap ass laptop I'm on :)
