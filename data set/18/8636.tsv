2007-07-20T07:45:00.000Z	persept		does anyone have experience with the LiveCD?
2007-07-20T07:45:00.000Z	persept		I need to add extra 'memory' to the machine via a usb-drive, while it's running the livecd, my friends hard drive failed and i'm trying to give him a usable computer in the meantime
2007-07-20T07:45:00.000Z	persept		the machine runs very slow, because of the low memory, can anyone help, it's really important
2007-07-20T07:47:00.000Z	LiveUSB	persept	yup what you need to know?
2007-07-20T07:47:00.000Z	persept	LiveUSB	well I tried adding the usb drive as a swap drive, but I can't really tell if that is doing anything at all, i don't think it's even using it
2007-07-20T07:48:00.000Z	LiveUSB	persept	it won't do too much.. how slow of a smachine are we talking here?
2007-07-20T07:49:00.000Z	persept	LiveUSB	the computers is fast enough, but there's only 1gb of ram, and only 120 mb of ram are free, so I want to have it use the flash drive
2007-07-20T07:49:00.000Z	persept	LiveUSB	will ubuntu fit on a 1gb flash drive?
2007-07-20T07:50:00.000Z	LiveUSB	persept	thats's no where near what I would call "slow" I'm talking about my Celeron 1.3 with 386Mb ram.. you should be fine with 1 GB
2007-07-20T07:50:00.000Z	persept	LiveUSB	will it fit on a flash drive though?
2007-07-20T07:50:00.000Z	LiveUSB	persept	I'm only using 2 GB cause Of all the junk i like to carry.
2007-07-20T07:51:00.000Z	LiveUSB	persept	I'm going to PM you otherwise it's going to get messy in here
2007-07-20T07:56:00.000Z	LiveUSB	persept	hope the PM helps you out a bit
2007-07-20T07:57:00.000Z	persept	LiveUSB	I didn't get any PM for you
2007-07-20T07:57:00.000Z	LiveUSB	persept	odd.. I've written .. ohh well in any event .. visit  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LiveUsbPendrivePersistent to see how to boot live.. you should only need 1gb,
2007-07-20T07:58:00.000Z	LiveUSB		I've found it can be a bit tight if you like to install a bunch of apps with only 300MB left on a drive but it's quite manageable..
2007-07-20T08:00:00.000Z	LiveUSB	persept	the speed difference from CD to Flash drive is awesome.. "almost" as fast as an installed system.
2007-07-20T08:01:00.000Z	persept	LiveUSB	ok cool i'm looking at that
