2008-06-16T23:10:00.000Z	lakis1982		now im logged in in my computer as a user .. how do i change and log in as root ?
2008-06-16T23:11:00.000Z	soundray	lakis1982	you don't. Ubuntu is designed to be administered using sudo, while the root account remains locked.
2008-08-08T21:58:00.000Z	soundray	lakis1982	there is no 'dos environment'. How did you update the kernel?
2008-08-08T21:58:00.000Z	soundray	lakis1982	can you boot to the old kernel?
2008-08-08T21:59:00.000Z	soundray	lakis1982	okay, something is missing from the new kernel that prevents X from starting. What video driver do you have?
2008-08-08T22:01:00.000Z	soundray	lakis1982	okay, here's what to do: log in at the command line and do a 'sudo cp /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf-backup'
2008-08-08T22:01:00.000Z	soundray	lakis1982	when you've done that, 'sudo invoke-rc.d gdm start'
2008-08-08T22:01:00.000Z	soundray	lakis1982	everything between the quotes
2008-08-08T22:03:00.000Z	soundray	lakis1982	where are you right now?
2008-08-08T22:04:00.000Z	soundray	lakis1982	KDE with the old kernel?
2008-08-08T22:04:00.000Z	soundray	lakis1982	never mind the second command. Try booting to the new kernel now.
2008-08-08T22:05:00.000Z	soundray	lakis1982	yes
2008-08-08T22:21:00.000Z	soundray	lakis1982	when you did the 'sudo mv /etc/X11/xorg.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf-backup', did it give you an error message?
2008-08-08T22:22:00.000Z	soundray	lakis1982	did you install any other updates with adept?
2008-08-08T22:23:00.000Z	soundray	lakis1982	open adept and install all available updates. Then try booting to the new kernel again.
2008-08-08T22:25:00.000Z	soundray	lakis1982	adept should tell you. Alternatively, close adept and run on the command line: 'sudo apt-get update ; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade'
2008-08-08T22:27:00.000Z	soundray	lakis1982	I don't know how to fix your problem
2008-08-08T22:31:00.000Z	soundray	lakis1982	stick to the actual problem
