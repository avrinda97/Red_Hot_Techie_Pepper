2006-05-04T12:39:00.000Z	CuriousCat		Would anyone know what would be the name of the package for the SMP kernel for a 686?
2006-05-04T12:40:00.000Z	linux_galore	CuriousCat	you can use apt-get to search for things not just install them
2006-05-04T12:40:00.000Z	CuriousCat	linux_galore	how?
2006-05-04T12:41:00.000Z	linux_galore	CuriousCat	apt-cache search whatever
2006-05-04T13:20:00.000Z	linux_galore	CuriousCat	I feeel a del laptop, iiiiits blaaaack with a biiiig screeeen, aaand your in heeeell
2006-05-04T13:21:00.000Z	CuriousCat	linux_galore	er... hmmm.
2006-05-04T13:27:00.000Z	linux_galore	CuriousCat	the driver is still beta
2006-05-04T13:27:00.000Z	linux_galore	CuriousCat	http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum=ipw3945-devel
2006-05-04T13:29:00.000Z	CuriousCat	linux_galore	according to this, it's already stable
2006-05-04T13:30:00.000Z	linux_galore	CuriousCat	if your a code monkey yes
2006-05-18T08:54:00.000Z	linux_galore	CuriousCat	is it use or serial
2006-05-18T08:55:00.000Z	linux_galore	CuriousCat	is it USB or serial
2006-05-18T08:55:00.000Z	CuriousCat	linux_galore	uhm... it's integrated into my laptop. :)
2006-05-18T08:56:00.000Z	linux_galore	CuriousCat	aaah, bet its a software modem so your shit out of luck
2006-05-18T08:57:00.000Z	linux_galore	CuriousCat	most laptops use software based devices to save money, down side is there OS specific
2006-05-18T09:03:00.000Z	CuriousCat	linux_galore	yeah. but then at least it isn't ac97. It's Conexant, which is why i'm wondering if this would work this time around
2006-05-18T09:04:00.000Z	linux_galore	CuriousCat	connextant stuff is always a problem because they use software to hide the fact the chips are pretty crappy and cheap
