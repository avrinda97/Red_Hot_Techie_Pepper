2007-08-19T08:08:00.000Z	erUSUL	oompaloompa	no problem
2007-08-19T08:12:00.000Z	oompaloompa	erUSUL	what option do i need in /etc/fstab to make a partition readable/writable by *user*?
2007-08-19T08:13:00.000Z	erUSUL	oompaloompa	what file system type?
2007-08-19T08:13:00.000Z	oompaloompa	erUSUL	ext3
2007-08-19T08:14:00.000Z	oompaloompa	erUSUL	or do i just need to make the mount point folder options appropriate?  would that do it?
2007-08-19T08:14:00.000Z	erUSUL	oompaloompa	not possible you have to mount it normally and create folders inside which you then can give permisions as you like (the same as with a separate home partition).
2007-08-19T08:15:00.000Z	oompaloompa	erUSUL	so i can't the mount point in fstab as /media/movies and then create /media/movies as root and then make /media/movies readable/writable?
2007-08-19T08:15:00.000Z	erUSUL	oompaloompa	for example i have two partitions mounted in /mnt/ which i use for media files. in both i have folders like /Music/ /Movies/ etc which i have rw permisions
2007-08-19T08:18:00.000Z	oompaloompa	erUSUL	well it's screaming that i don't have the privilege to mount the volume. . .obviously i don't want to have to mount the volume as root every time i logon, so how would i change the "owner" to *username* and have it mount automatically?
2007-08-19T08:22:00.000Z	oompaloompa	erUSUL	nvm i got it, and thanks
2007-08-19T08:22:00.000Z	erUSUL	oompaloompa	no problem
