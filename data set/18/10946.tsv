2010-02-18T03:36:00.000Z	Samuel_		Hi.  Is there a command line program to install ubuntu packages that does all the fun stuff like automatically installing dependancies and asking configuration questions?
2010-02-18T03:37:00.000Z	dabaR	Samuel_	you mean like apt-get/aptitude?
2010-02-18T03:38:00.000Z	dabaR	Samuel_	is it sort of the command line synaptic?
2010-02-18T03:38:00.000Z	Samuel_	dabaR	PingFloyd, yes, I want something like either apt-get or aptitude that will work on a downloaded .deb file
2010-02-18T03:38:00.000Z	dabaR	Samuel_	and it can not be gdebi (has a gui)?
2010-02-18T03:39:00.000Z	Samuel_	dabaR	I was looking for something that comes with ubuntu-server
2010-02-18T03:45:00.000Z	dabaR	Samuel_	you then --force it
2010-02-18T03:45:00.000Z	Samuel_	dabaR	I want it to install the dependencies, not ignore them
2010-02-18T03:46:00.000Z	Samuel_	dabaR	it's just a software application/solution that my team is developing
2010-02-18T03:47:00.000Z	Samuel_	dabaR	it works great in ubuntu-desktop because I can just tell the customer to double click on the .deb file, and it does everything automatically and asks the users questions, etc.  But now my customers are complaining that there isn't an easy way to install it in ubuntu-server
2010-02-18T03:52:00.000Z	dabaR	Samuel_	I am almost positive that there is a option for dpkg or something like that to install deps
2010-02-18T03:53:00.000Z	Samuel_	dabaR	that's what I was thinking, but I can't find it
2010-02-18T03:53:00.000Z	dabaR	Samuel_	and you read the man page?
2010-02-18T03:55:00.000Z	Samuel_	dabaR	the only thing I see for dependency checking is UNINSTALLING a package, not INSTALLING :(
2010-02-18T03:57:00.000Z	dabaR	Samuel_	ya, heh, totally, gdebi is a command line tool
2010-02-18T03:58:00.000Z	dabaR	Samuel_	gdebi-gtk is its gui
2010-02-18T03:58:00.000Z	dabaR	Samuel_	but you should be able to test it out with gdebi on the command line
2010-02-18T03:59:00.000Z	Samuel_	dabaR	jrib, well I was hoping there was a tool that already came with Ubuntu, but if I have to require them to install gdebi ahead of time, I guess I'll do that
