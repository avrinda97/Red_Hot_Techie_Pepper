2005-12-06T07:07:00.000Z	YukiIkyuta		Do you have the CD you used to install? Or even the live CD?
2005-12-06T07:09:00.000Z	YukiIkyuta		So you can use that configuration still.
2005-12-06T07:09:00.000Z	YukiIkyuta		There aren't specific files to save.
2005-12-06T07:10:00.000Z	YukiIkyuta		When Windows is installed, it overwrites something called the Master Boot Record (MBR).
2005-12-06T07:10:00.000Z	YukiIkyuta		So you must reinstall GRUB to the MBR using the Live CD, typically.
2005-12-06T07:10:00.000Z	YukiIkyuta		Good.
