2007-09-18T10:03:00.000Z	underwatercow		what do +win,+x11drv,+event,+xrandr refer to?
2007-09-18T10:04:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	underwatercow	where are you getting that + stuff from anyway?
2007-09-18T10:05:00.000Z	underwatercow	Dr_Willis	"Please attach a log of running the game with +win,+x11drv,+event,+xrandr"
2007-09-18T10:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	underwatercow	sounds almost like gentoo talk.
2007-09-18T10:06:00.000Z	underwatercow	Dr_Willis	It's from the wine forum
2007-09-18T10:06:00.000Z	underwatercow	Dr_Willis	Bugzilla for wine
2007-09-18T10:06:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	underwatercow	sounds like options they may wanting enabled for wine then.
2007-09-18T10:07:00.000Z	underwatercow	Dr_Willis	Is there somewhere else I should be asking?
2007-09-18T10:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	underwatercow	#wine perhaps?
2007-09-18T10:07:00.000Z	underwatercow	Dr_Willis	I'll try, thanks
2007-09-18T10:13:00.000Z	underwatercow	Dr_Willis	They are wine debug options
2007-09-18T10:14:00.000Z	underwatercow	Dr_Willis	now where would the wine log be? ;-D
2007-09-18T10:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	underwatercow	:) i guessed right eh.. :)  hmm in the .wine dir perhaps?
2007-11-06T09:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	underwatercow	google for some 'lowercase filename' scripts - thers proberly 100 ways to do it. the 'advanced bash scripting guide' i think has some example scripts also
2007-11-06T09:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	underwatercow	sed, awk, perl, use of 'tr' and so forth. :)
2007-11-06T09:41:00.000Z	underwatercow	Dr_Willis	thanks, I figured I could write my own script, but I'm just too lazy/busy at the moment ;-D
2007-11-06T09:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	underwatercow	there also the rename utilities  'qmv' that i lilke :)
2007-11-06T09:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	underwatercow	it puts the files in the dir in a text editor you then edit the names how ya want.. and exit. it then changes them baseed on your edits. :)
