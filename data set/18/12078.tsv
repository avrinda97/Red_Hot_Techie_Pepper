2006-06-10T11:23:00.000Z	SurfnKid	iiiears	ever since ive been on ubuntu im a bit more at peace with myself, i just dont know why, i can breath a bit better when it comes to manipulating hardware
2006-06-19T08:58:00.000Z	SurfnKid	iiiears	i want to disable the GUI part on boot up on this machine and know how to enable it. Will that tell me how to or just fix resolution problems
2006-06-19T08:58:00.000Z	iiiears	SurfnKid	You can always make the terminal the default boot option in i think "sessions" on the log in screen no?
2006-06-19T08:59:00.000Z	SurfnKid	iiiears	thats what i want. not sure
2006-06-19T08:59:00.000Z	SurfnKid	iiiears	not sure where to do that
2006-06-19T09:00:00.000Z	SurfnKid	iiiears	id like to have x not load up. but know where to change and enable it by changing something in a file to re-enable it back
2006-06-19T09:01:00.000Z	iiiears	SurfnKid	The log in screen has an option. - just entirely guessing there might be something in rc.d

2006-06-19T12:34:00.000Z	SurfnKid	iiiears	how big is the install?

2006-06-19T12:37:00.000Z	SurfnKid	iiiears	yeah, i use it only under windows to avoid graphics installation issues, but i have to try it under linux, now that ive got the glx card running well
