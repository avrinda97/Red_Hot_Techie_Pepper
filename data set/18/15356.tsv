2005-04-18T07:09:00.000Z	synd		wow xfce is so much better for low end laptops
2005-04-18T07:11:00.000Z	synd		is there any way to login from one ubuntu computer to another on the same LAN..?
2005-04-18T07:11:00.000Z	synd		with the ability to see and control the desktop on that computer?
2005-04-18T07:12:00.000Z	synd		sentence
2005-04-18T07:13:00.000Z	mlambie	synd	check out xnest, rdesktop (the terminal server client) and enabling XDMCP on the target machine (through the GDM login configuration)
2005-04-18T07:14:00.000Z	mlambie	synd	tritium: I use x11vnc to control the *actual* desktop displayed on a remote machine
2005-04-18T07:14:00.000Z	synd	mlambie	is it easy to set up?
2005-04-18T07:17:00.000Z	mlambie	synd	you need to add x11vnc to the session in GNOME, but the x11vnc website shows you how, and there's ubuntu packages
2005-04-18T07:17:00.000Z	synd	mlambie	alright, ill check that out
2005-04-18T07:19:00.000Z	mlambie	synd	I then setup a password in ~/.vnc/passwd using vncpasswd on my laptop. i added an icon that links to "/usr/bin/vncviewer -passwd /home/mlambie/.vnc/passwd duke:0" where duke is my server, and :0 is the display
2005-04-18T07:20:00.000Z	synd	mlambie	ah... i see
2005-04-18T07:20:00.000Z	mlambie	synd	i click that and it brings up the VNC session without asking for a password. note though it only seems to like one single session at a time, and x11vnc has crashed on me a few times after about two weeks.
2005-04-18T07:21:00.000Z	mlambie		that's no problem because this machine is on a home lan raping bit torrents, so a reboot isn't anything i can't live with every few weeks or so.
2005-04-18T07:21:00.000Z	mlambie		and that's only been once or twice; it's farily stable. ssh etc will still respond, just vnc is dead
2005-04-18T07:22:00.000Z	synd	mlambie	oh ok. well i just wanna have it to be able to check my Gaim running on a computer in my room while im at other places in the house working on other ubuntu computers
2005-04-18T07:22:00.000Z	mlambie		can yo unot be logged in on all the computesr with GAIM? will it log you out when you log in elsewhere?
2005-04-18T07:23:00.000Z	synd	mlambie	yes, but you cant check what messages were left on the other computer
