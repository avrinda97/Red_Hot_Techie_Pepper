2009-07-18T10:25:00.000Z	nsadmin		if you end up having to build the driver, that's the kernel config
2009-07-18T10:27:00.000Z	nsadmin		well one sec...
2009-07-18T10:28:00.000Z	nsadmin		are you running amd64 or ix86 kernel?
2009-07-18T10:29:00.000Z	nsadmin		maybe you could find a 2.6.29 kernel for your ubuntu
2009-07-18T10:29:00.000Z	nsadmin		what's your uname -r
2009-07-18T10:30:00.000Z	nsadmin		no, uname -r
2009-07-18T10:30:00.000Z	nsadmin		tht's different from a userhame
2009-07-18T10:31:00.000Z	nsadmin		it's your kernel name
2009-07-18T10:31:00.000Z	nsadmin		uname -r
2009-07-18T10:32:00.000Z	nsadmin		yeah you would... I'm trying to find out if you already have .29
2009-07-18T10:32:00.000Z	sebsebseb	nsadmin	there's a ppa for 2.6.30
2009-07-18T10:32:00.000Z	sebsebseb	nsadmin	also why do you think you need a later kernel anyway?
2009-07-18T10:32:00.000Z	nsadmin	sebsebseb	marvell nic
2009-07-18T10:33:00.000Z	sebsebseb	nsadmin	hardware issues don't just get fixed in later kernels,  well depends
2009-07-18T10:34:00.000Z	nsadmin	sebsebseb	it's this one (and it's for xtremeshredder)
2009-07-18T10:36:00.000Z	nsadmin	sebsebseb	any idea the name of the module for that card?
2009-07-18T10:37:00.000Z	sebsebseb	nsadmin	no not my area
2009-07-18T10:38:00.000Z	sebsebseb	nsadmin	ppa is a way to get later  stuff for Ubuntu, without  having to  wait for the next version
