2007-04-26T09:55:00.000Z	milage		I asked about monitors about 10 minutes ago, but that's not important anymore
2007-04-26T09:55:00.000Z	SuperQ	milage	oh yea?
2007-04-26T09:55:00.000Z	SuperQ	milage	what's important now?
2007-04-26T09:55:00.000Z	SuperQ	milage	"freezing" how?
2007-04-26T09:56:00.000Z	SuperQ	milage	see.. that's something not frozen
2007-04-26T09:56:00.000Z	SuperQ	milage	can you click on anything?
2007-04-26T09:56:00.000Z	SuperQ	milage	how many times has it "frozen" in that way?
2007-04-26T09:57:00.000Z	SuperQ	milage	ouch
2007-04-26T09:57:00.000Z	SuperQ	milage	so the number 1 cause of that kind of problem: hardware
2007-04-26T09:57:00.000Z	SuperQ	milage	either incompatible, or flakey
2007-04-26T09:57:00.000Z	SuperQ	milage	have you run other versions of Ubuntu on it?
2007-04-26T09:58:00.000Z	SuperQ	milage	what are you running now?
2007-04-26T09:59:00.000Z	SuperQ	milage	what CPU type, and motherboard?
2007-04-26T10:01:00.000Z	SuperQ	milage	milage that's not too bad
2007-04-26T10:02:00.000Z	SuperQ	milage	are you running nvidia or nv video driver?
2007-04-26T10:15:00.000Z	SuperQ	milage	yea.. i would try nv or vesa, just to be safe
2007-04-26T10:15:00.000Z	SuperQ	milage	one change at a time
