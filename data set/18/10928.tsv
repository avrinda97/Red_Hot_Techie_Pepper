2007-05-10T15:26:00.000Z	SoftIce		who would I be able to speak to, to get an answer on when vserver will be supported in ubuntu ?
2007-05-10T15:28:00.000Z	crimsun	SoftIce	what in particular?
2007-05-10T15:28:00.000Z	SoftIce	crimsun	well I need a supported vserver kernel
2007-05-10T15:28:00.000Z	SoftIce	crimsun	debian has kernel-vserver in all their releases
2007-05-10T15:29:00.000Z	SoftIce	crimsun	now i'm stuck with a dapper box and no supported kernel, there is this edgy kernel, linux-vserver-image-2.6.17-11-vserver-generic, but it has not been patched
2007-05-10T15:29:00.000Z	SoftIce	crimsun	so this kernel would be vulnerable to the latest exploits
2007-05-10T15:32:00.000Z	crimsun	SoftIce	are you referring to linux-vserver.org or linuxvirtualserver.org ?
2007-05-10T15:32:00.000Z	SoftIce	crimsun	linux-vserver
2007-05-10T15:34:00.000Z	crimsun	SoftIce	they don't seem to provide a public git tree
2007-05-10T15:35:00.000Z	crimsun	SoftIce	if you write up a spec to include it in 7.10, I'll try to allocate some resources to review it.
2007-05-10T15:36:00.000Z	crimsun	SoftIce	you'll want to look at how we handle diffs to our ubuntu-gutsy git tree  (see http://hera.kernel.org/git/)
2007-05-10T15:36:00.000Z	SoftIce	crimsun	so what the issue is right now, is nobody has taken charge of support to linux-vserver (kernel) ?
2007-05-10T15:36:00.000Z	crimsun	SoftIce	essentially.
2007-05-10T15:37:00.000Z	SoftIce	crimsun	isn't this quite a across board solution ?
2007-05-10T15:37:00.000Z	SoftIce		and to ease of installation not to have to compile source kernels the entire time?
2007-05-10T15:37:00.000Z	crimsun	SoftIce	I'm not sure why you're asking me that.  You'll want to address those ideas in your spec.
