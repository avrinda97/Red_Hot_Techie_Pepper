2011-01-24T14:12:00.000Z	asfjio		hello guys! i'm with Ubuntu 8.10. do you think if i try to update it many things will broke? i want to update, becase have many things to configure if i choose to install a fresh new ubuntu. can i go only with the updates?
2011-01-24T14:14:00.000Z	red2kic	asfjio	Upgrade ; Upgrade ; Upgrade ; Upgrade ; Upgrade ; What? That's crazy. Just back up /home/asfjio and /etc/ -- That's it.
2011-01-24T14:21:00.000Z	asfjio	red2kic	if i backup /etc/ i'm not sure i can just paste it then, right?
2011-01-24T14:23:00.000Z	red2kic	asfjio	I can suggest you to try https://launchpad.net/deja-dup
2011-01-24T14:24:00.000Z	red2kic	asfjio	See if you have deja-dup in the repo. It'll take care of unncessary items and /etc/, $HOME too.
2011-01-24T14:24:00.000Z	red2kic	asfjio	You don't have to *plop* the files back in -- It's good to have backup, and yes, you can *plop* the files back in -- but newer versions mean newer configuration options. Keep that in mind
2011-01-24T14:26:00.000Z	asfjio	red2kic	understand your point.
2011-01-24T14:31:00.000Z	asfjio	red2kic	psycho_oreos, h-dee: thank you for your time. by the way how much time approximately the installation will took?
2011-01-24T14:33:00.000Z	red2kic	asfjio	As long as it need to take. It varies for every person. Download speed. How good are you with linux? Some people have scripts that automagically set up everything.
2011-01-24T14:41:00.000Z	red2kic	asfjio	Ubuntu uses GNOME. Lubuntu uses LXDE. Kubuntu uses KDE.
2011-01-24T14:46:00.000Z	red2kic	asfjio	evolution files are in /home/asfjio -- So you would be already backing up evolution if you use the deja dup. That's fine. :)
2011-04-12T12:14:00.000Z	red2kic	asfjio	Disable file system journaling, me think. http://support.apple.com/kb/ht2355
2011-04-12T12:15:00.000Z	red2kic	asfjio	Backward Compatible --> Users can read, write, and access journaled Mac OS Extended volumes on computers that do not have a journaling feature.
2011-04-12T12:15:00.000Z	red2kic	asfjio	"In order to write to an HFS+ partition, it is necessary to disable journaling. This can be accomplished using Mac OS X Disk Utility"
2011-04-12T12:16:00.000Z	asfjio	red2kic	so i can't disable the journaling using ubuntu?
2011-04-12T12:17:00.000Z	red2kic	asfjio	No. Get on OSX.
2011-04-12T12:21:00.000Z	asfjio	red2kic	thank you very much!
2011-04-12T12:23:00.000Z	red2kic	asfjio	No problem. Have a nice day. I accept donations. :)
