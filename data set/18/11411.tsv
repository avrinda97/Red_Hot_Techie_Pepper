2006-07-30T14:28:00.000Z	ptley	mwtb	I have one at work... but am at home.  I looked at were http://www.sput.nl/unicode.html
2006-07-30T14:29:00.000Z	mwtb	ptley	Thanks, reading.
2006-07-30T14:31:00.000Z	ptley	mwtb	oh, I looked at that.  Keep in mind that when it says to add codepages, it means in /etc/fstab and that is for mounting unicode smbfs shares not serving them
2006-07-30T14:33:00.000Z	mwtb	ptley	Sure, unfortunately I can't get anything to work. codepage=unicode,iocharset=utf8,unicode is the general advice and this successfully mounts and then I get an empty response from an ls of the mount point. The suggestion on the page you provided mounts and gives a directory listing, but displays ?'s for non-ascii chars.
2006-07-30T14:37:00.000Z	ptley	mwtb	- oh... is unicode working on your terminal?
2006-07-30T14:38:00.000Z	mwtb	ptley	Yep, if I mount the share with cifs, I can see the unicode filenames correctly. Unfortunately, cifs seems to be broken in other ways.
2006-07-30T14:43:00.000Z	ptley	mwtb	you can get the 1.42 beta http://pserver.samba.org/samba/ftp/cifs-cvs/cifs-1.42b.tar.gz
2006-07-30T14:44:00.000Z	ptley	mwtb	I guess that's not beta, just their naming convention
2006-07-30T14:45:00.000Z	mwtb	ptley	I'm a bit wary of installing things that low-level, but thanks. I'll see what happens.
2006-07-30T14:45:00.000Z	ptley	mwtb	I'll try installing it real quick and tell you how it goes
2006-07-30T15:10:00.000Z	mwtb	ptley	So I'm following these instructions and I'm about to make the kernel. I am right that this will just build it in place and won't actually install it, yes?
2006-07-30T15:11:00.000Z	ptley	mwtb	as long as you don't do "make install" and whatnot
2006-07-30T15:13:00.000Z	mwtb	ptley	Okay, here goes. I didn't really expect to be compiling a kernel when I chose to try out ubuntu, it has to be said. Seems to go against the ideology of the distro a bit.
2006-07-30T15:15:00.000Z	ptley	mwtb	I also find it a bit unlikely that ubuntu will really be able to support the same kernel for "Long Term Support" and everyone is going to end up compiling a kernel.
2006-07-30T15:17:00.000Z	mwtb	ptley	Perhaps. Can't it just be updated via apt-get though? My FC install updates the kernel via yum.
2006-07-30T15:19:00.000Z	ptley	mwtb	it's not as bad as it was when upgrading 2.0 kernels to 2.2
2006-07-30T15:21:00.000Z	mwtb	ptley	It doesn't bother me as an activity. I'm used to building things via make etc. It just makes me feel like I'm getting further and further away from the cosy concept of a tightly managed desktop OS distro. I was hoping to avoid spending hours hunting for solutions and specific package versions with Ubuntu.
2006-07-30T15:23:00.000Z	ptley	mwtb	oh man... is that what ubuntu is supposed to be about?  I just like the logo
