2006-03-17T09:45:00.000Z	Jemt	kbrooks	To get the most recent features, yes

2006-03-21T17:46:00.000Z	Jemt	kbrooks	I know about CHMOD
2006-03-21T17:46:00.000Z	kbrooks	Jemt	not chmod
2006-03-21T17:46:00.000Z	Jemt	kbrooks	Oh?
2006-03-21T17:47:00.000Z	Jemt	kbrooks	What's the difference between group/world?
2006-03-21T17:48:00.000Z	Jemt	kbrooks	Ok, IC. Good to know. But can you explain the difference between Group and World? What do they cover?
2006-03-21T17:48:00.000Z	Jemt	kbrooks	So all files were executable? Weird
2006-03-21T17:48:00.000Z	Jemt	kbrooks	What group? You cannot specify a group in CHMOD - as far as I know
