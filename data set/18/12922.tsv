2006-02-23T08:10:00.000Z	JLiquorish		yeh, back in gnome =)
2006-02-23T08:11:00.000Z	JLiquorish		ill have to edit xorg.conf a bit more carefully
2006-02-23T08:11:00.000Z	JLiquorish		i have dont it before and it worked, it doesnt recognize my monitors HorizSync or VertSync or the max resolution
2006-02-23T08:12:00.000Z	JLiquorish		*done
2006-02-23T08:12:00.000Z	navarone	JLiquorish	what monitor?
2006-02-23T08:14:00.000Z	navarone	JLiquorish	in xorg.conf put these ranges in the appropriate section Horizontal Scan Range: 50 - 160 kHz, Vertical Scan Range 30 - 85 Hz
2006-02-23T08:16:00.000Z	navarone	JLiquorish	I find reconfiguring the whole x-server thing can cause more probs. I find it easier to just get the info you need to fix prob and add it to xorg.conf yourself
2006-02-23T08:18:00.000Z	navarone	JLiquorish	in monitor section of xorg.conf replace the horiz/vert with 50 - 160 and 30 - 85 Hz respectively
2006-02-23T08:18:00.000Z	navarone	JLiquorish	have you restarted xserver?
2006-02-23T08:24:00.000Z	navarone	JLiquorish	hope it works
2006-02-23T08:25:00.000Z	navarone	JLiquorish	your monitor cannot use that resolution
2006-02-23T08:26:00.000Z	navarone	JLiquorish	according to what I have read the max resolution is 1280x1024 at 75mhz

2006-02-23T08:31:00.000Z	navarone	JLiquorish	yeah I was gonna say you'd want a magnifying glass at 1600x1200...lol
2006-02-23T08:33:00.000Z	JLiquorish	navarone	after restarting X again i know have alot of resolutions :S
