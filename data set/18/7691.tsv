2007-12-08T08:11:00.000Z	soldats	Pulshion	i dont recall any problems with x11
2007-12-08T08:11:00.000Z	Pulshion	soldats	whats is the difference then?
2007-12-08T08:11:00.000Z	soldats	Pulshion	compiz seems to have many problems with that sort of stuff
2007-12-08T08:12:00.000Z	soldats	Pulshion	for some reason i see many people having confusion with compiz for video desktop effects and audio codecs, it seems that you may need to do a thurough search for codecs for your needs
2007-12-08T08:13:00.000Z	Pulshion	soldats	if it works with x11 ill just leave it at it
2007-12-08T08:13:00.000Z	soldats	Pulshion	ok
2007-12-26T09:04:00.000Z	soldats	Pulshion	sudo apt-get remove mplayer
2007-12-26T09:04:00.000Z	Pulshion	soldats	it doesnt exist
2007-12-26T09:05:00.000Z	soldats	Pulshion	hmm so if it was uninstalled i wonder why it still works
2007-12-26T09:06:00.000Z	Pulshion	soldats	cause i compiled it myself
2007-12-26T09:06:00.000Z	soldats	Pulshion	delete the dir where its installed, the README.txt should say how to uninstall it
2007-12-26T09:07:00.000Z	Pulshion	soldats	if i could find the directory
2007-12-26T09:07:00.000Z	Pulshion	soldats	yea i deleted that directory
2007-12-26T09:08:00.000Z	soldats	Pulshion	look at _juan s post
2007-12-26T09:08:00.000Z	Pulshion	soldats	i dont think thats where it was installed
