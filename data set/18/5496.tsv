2009-01-03T15:43:00.000Z	bingungaja	Slart	any luck ?
2009-01-03T15:44:00.000Z	Slart	bingungaja	well.. cfs seems to work just fine on my 64 bit install
2009-01-03T15:44:00.000Z	Slart	bingungaja	according to the brief testing 've done so far
2009-01-03T15:45:00.000Z	bingungaja	Slart	when I try attach the folder ,, some error occured,,,, RPC: Can't encode argumentshendri@hendri-laptop:~$
2009-01-03T15:45:00.000Z	bingungaja	Slart	and then I try to google and some said it won't work on 64 bit
2009-01-03T15:48:00.000Z	Slart	bingungaja	hmm.. I seem to have some problems creating files in my encrypted folders.. well well
2009-01-03T15:48:00.000Z	Slart	bingungaja	I don't know of anything as simple as this.. there's always truecrypt and friends..
2009-01-03T15:49:00.000Z	bingungaja	Slart	too bad, it seems this software is very good and simple, i tried truecrypt, but will it take a long time to encrypt a 2gb folder using truecrypt ?
2009-01-03T15:51:00.000Z	Slart	bingungaja	I don't think you'll starve to death before it's finished.. but I don't really know
