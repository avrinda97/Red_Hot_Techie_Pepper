2007-02-12T15:16:00.000Z	pollywog		I did an upgrade on Edgy and it rendered my system unbootable by modifying my fstab to use some long ID's
2007-02-12T15:16:00.000Z	pollywog		is there a way to fix this?
2007-02-12T15:18:00.000Z	pollywog		is "ik ga weg" Dutch for "leaving"?
2007-02-12T15:20:00.000Z	pollywog		is anyone else ending up with an unbootable system after an upgrade in Edgy?
2007-02-12T15:20:00.000Z	linxeh	pollywog	not unbootable, but the nvidia drivers dont work (here anyway)
2007-02-12T15:21:00.000Z	pollywog	linxeh	I don't have the nvidia problem I wish it were only that
2007-02-12T15:21:00.000Z	linxeh	pollywog	you can always boot from the CD if necessary
2007-02-12T15:21:00.000Z	pollywog	linxeh	yeah but my HD will be inaccessible won't it?
2007-02-12T15:22:00.000Z	linxeh	pollywog	not if you do it the right way; you can use the kernel on the cd and tell it to use your hard drive as the root partition
2007-02-12T15:22:00.000Z	pollywog	linxeh	have a url for me that tells me how?
2007-02-12T15:23:00.000Z	pollywog		nvm I will check the wiki
2007-02-12T15:23:00.000Z	pollywog	linxeh	thanks for your help
2007-02-12T15:23:00.000Z	linxeh	pollywog	im looking to see if i can find a link
2007-02-12T15:24:00.000Z	pollywog	linxeh	k thanks
2007-02-12T15:26:00.000Z	pollywog	linxeh	btw I have the alternative install CD for Edgy
2007-02-12T15:26:00.000Z	linxeh	pollywog	I cant remember exactly, but you should be able to edit the boot options on the grub menu on that cd, and tell the kernel "initrd=/dev/hd....."
2007-02-12T15:27:00.000Z	linxeh	pollywog	where you pass in the device that has your / partition
2007-02-12T15:27:00.000Z	pollywog	linxeh	ty
