2011-06-09T20:35:00.000Z	dasher		if you don't know what SSD is used for, you shouldn't use it
2011-06-09T20:36:00.000Z	dasher		SSD has the same write cycles as any other type of flash or solid state service, it has no moving parts
2011-06-09T20:36:00.000Z	dasher		write cycles are controlled by the CPU NOT the harddrive/storage
2011-06-09T20:36:00.000Z	dasher		service=storage
2011-06-09T20:37:00.000Z	dasher		SSD is most often used in embedded systems
2011-06-09T20:37:00.000Z	dasher		limited by storage
2011-06-09T20:38:00.000Z	dasher		i can show you bitmasking on a CPU, and show you it's very CPU dependent
2011-06-09T20:39:00.000Z	dasher		limited write cycles, lmao
2011-06-09T20:39:00.000Z	dasher		i love how ppl in here pretend they know wtf they're talking about
2011-06-09T20:40:00.000Z	dasher		whoever told you that doesn't know what they're blabbering about
2011-06-09T20:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dasher	"Solid state drives that use flash memory have a limited number of writes over the life of the drive.[56][57][58][59]SSDs based on DRAM do not have a limited number of writes." http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive
2011-06-09T20:40:00.000Z	dasher		over the life of the drive!!!
2011-06-09T20:40:00.000Z	dasher		that's what, 3, 4 years?
2011-06-09T20:41:00.000Z	dasher		stop being a offtopic nazi, this is a legit conversation relating to ubuntu
2011-06-09T20:41:00.000Z	dasher	julie	all harddrives have limited write cycles
2011-06-09T20:41:00.000Z	dasher		that's like saying all satellites have limited use
2011-06-09T20:41:00.000Z	dasher		yeah, no shit, they eventually fall to earth
2011-06-09T20:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dasher	depends on use, SQL servers on SSD will wear it out faster than standard desktop use
