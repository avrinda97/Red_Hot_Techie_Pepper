2007-03-15T16:49:00.000Z	darweth		Does anyone know how to change how firefox handles certain files?  I accidentally set torrent files to always dload to the desktop, but i want the open/save dialog back instead.  i tried managing file-types in content prefs, but it is not there.
2007-03-15T05:18:00.000Z	darweth		Does anyone know if Feisty will stop using a dumb altered version of Firefox and just use the Mozilla version?
2007-03-15T05:18:00.000Z	bruenig	darweth	dumb...
2007-03-15T05:18:00.000Z	bruenig		cables yet another reason apt-get > aptitude
2007-03-15T05:19:00.000Z	darweth	bruenig	yes.  the preferences in Ubuntu's altered version are messed up.  Especially managing 'file types.'
2007-03-15T05:19:00.000Z	darweth		I set .torrent files accidentally to "automatically save to desktop everytime" and could not edit it in managing file types.
2007-03-15T05:19:00.000Z	darweth		I used aislyu's script to install the Mozilla version on top of it and it worked fine.
2007-03-15T05:19:00.000Z	darweth		So something is wrong.
2007-03-15T05:20:00.000Z	bruenig	darweth	doesn't that script replace your .mozilla directory
2007-03-15T05:20:00.000Z	darweth		No.
2007-03-15T05:21:00.000Z	darweth		It backed up every preference.
2007-03-15T05:21:00.000Z	darweth		And all settings.
2007-03-15T05:21:00.000Z	bruenig	darweth	wow how impressive that must have been for that script "mv ~/.mozilla ~/.mozilla.backup"
2007-03-15T05:22:00.000Z	bruenig	darweth	the ubuntu firefox can manage filetypes perfectly, at least mine can
2007-03-15T05:23:00.000Z	bruenig	darweth	what are the changes that ubuntu does to firefox
2007-03-15T05:23:00.000Z	bruenig		s/does/makes/
2007-03-15T05:23:00.000Z	darweth	bruenig	I cannot explain why it wouldn't work.  It is a fresh install of Ubuntu.
2007-03-15T05:24:00.000Z	bruenig	darweth	well perhaps you should see if somebody else had the same problem before making such a generalized statement
