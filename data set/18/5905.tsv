2008-08-03T19:19:00.000Z	ZEMEBi		fine i'll ask the question...just thought it would be better to see if anyone uses it
2008-08-03T19:20:00.000Z	ZEMEBi		joshua@joshua-desktop:~/Desktop/tor-0.2.0.30$ make install
2008-08-03T19:20:00.000Z	ZEMEBi		 make: *** No rule to make target `install'. Stop.
2008-08-03T19:20:00.000Z	ZEMEBi		what am I doing wrong?
2008-08-03T19:20:00.000Z	ZEMEBi		I'm a linux n00b btw

2008-08-03T19:20:00.000Z	wols	ZEMEBi	why do you compile tor?
2008-08-03T19:20:00.000Z	wols	ZEMEBi	why do you need a newer one?
2008-08-03T19:22:00.000Z	ZEMEBi	wols	newers means bug fixes etc...
2008-08-03T19:22:00.000Z	wols	ZEMEBi	backport from debian sid
2008-08-03T19:22:00.000Z	wols	ZEMEBi	as for your problem: ask tor people, not us
2008-08-03T19:22:00.000Z	ZEMEBi	wols	fine
2008-08-03T19:23:00.000Z	wols	ZEMEBi	you're missed to run configure most likely
2008-08-03T19:23:00.000Z	ZEMEBi	wols	i just followed instructions
2008-08-03T19:23:00.000Z	wols	ZEMEBi	I don't believe you
2008-08-03T19:24:00.000Z	ZEMEBi	wols	./configure && make
2008-08-03T19:24:00.000Z	wols	ZEMEBi	configure errored and you ignored it
