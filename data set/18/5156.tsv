2008-12-26T17:19:00.000Z	rinsmaster	erry	and where was that folder and who owns it? (see that same tab in the properties dialog)
2008-12-26T17:19:00.000Z	erry	rinsmaster	apparently root owns it
2008-12-26T17:21:00.000Z	rinsmaster	erry	is the folder in your ~ (/home/yourname)?, then you can make it yours without probs, just execute: chown -R yourname path/to/folder
