2008-02-04T09:29:00.000Z	bazhang	PKdoR	I have to step out for a moment (work), but your problem is definitely fixable--the other fine folks here may wish to help out. or I will be back later
2008-02-04T09:32:00.000Z	PKdoR	bazhang	thanks
2008-02-04T14:04:00.000Z	bazhang	PKdoR	why remove it? space at a premium?
2008-02-04T14:05:00.000Z	PKdoR	bazhang	not at all I just want to remove the defaul bit torrent but its asking to remove the ubunu deskop dependency?
2008-02-04T14:07:00.000Z	bazhang	PKdoR	not sure why you need to remove it--just set the default to what you want and remove it from the menu--ubuntu-desktop is just a metapackage from what I remember at any rate
