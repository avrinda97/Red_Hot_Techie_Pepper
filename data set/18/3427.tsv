2009-10-06T10:47:00.000Z	Tehedra		Anyone available to help me troubleshoot some phpmyadmin installation problems in ubuntu jaunty??
2009-10-06T10:47:00.000Z	cylex	Tehedra	not at all, do you want to follow a howto?
2009-10-06T10:48:00.000Z	cylex	Tehedra	can I see the link?
2009-10-06T10:51:00.000Z	Tehedra	cylex	http://pastebin.com/m5f924030
2009-10-06T10:52:00.000Z	cylex	Tehedra	its because you have this block called # Authorized for setup  .... comment that block out, and it should work
2009-10-06T10:57:00.000Z	cylex	Tehedra	no, I have ur file on pastebin, I'll fix it, and give it to you
2009-10-06T10:58:00.000Z	cylex	Tehedra	http://pastebin.com/m105f889d
2009-10-06T10:59:00.000Z	Tehedra	cylex	I made that change but still, http://zephyrnetwork.ca/phpmyadmin doesn't exist
2009-10-06T11:00:00.000Z	cylex	Tehedra	what's the main domain its on?
2009-10-06T11:03:00.000Z	Tehedra	cylex	http://wiki.phpmyadmin.net/pma/ubuntu (when i install phpmyadmin it doesn't ask me if i want to use apache2, it just installs itself automatically)
2009-10-06T11:03:00.000Z	Tehedra	cylex	im thinking this might be the issue
2009-10-06T11:04:00.000Z	cylex	Tehedra	hmm holdon
2009-10-06T11:05:00.000Z	cylex	Tehedra	try sudo dpkg-reconfigure phpmyadmin
2009-10-06T11:10:00.000Z	Tehedra	cylex	this time it asked me a bunch of information, including if i wanted it for apache2 still no go on the 404 but im going to check the conf file to see if it didn't get reverted
2009-10-06T11:11:00.000Z	cylex	Tehedra	ok
2009-10-06T11:13:00.000Z	cylex	Tehedra	you wanna just manually install PHPMyAdmin, it would be much easier
2009-10-06T11:16:00.000Z	Tehedra	cylex	sudo ln -s /etc/phpmyadmin/apache.conf /etc/apache2/conf.d/phpmyadmin.conf (running this and restarting apache worked)
2009-10-06T11:16:00.000Z	cylex	Tehedra	it must be that you had to restart apache :P
