2011-10-25T15:39:00.000Z	XMan2012		and download and execute this application ....it just a matter of couple of seconds
2011-10-25T15:39:00.000Z	XMan2012		to open and run
2011-10-25T15:39:00.000Z	XMan2012		Ubuntu makes me crazy to rub this app
2011-10-25T15:40:00.000Z	XMan2012		<GinoMan> Did you find any way to install this application on ubuntu 10.10?
2011-10-25T15:41:00.000Z	XMan2012		i think Ubuntu needs to be improved
2011-10-25T15:42:00.000Z	XMan2012		but running a simple application...
2011-10-25T15:42:00.000Z	dr_willis	XMan2012	 its constantly being improved..  thats why they add all sorts of features in between lts versions to iron stuff out for the next lts
2011-10-25T15:46:00.000Z	dr_willis	XMan2012	 check your spelling and paths.. Case IS imporntant in linux
2011-10-25T15:47:00.000Z	dr_willis	XMan2012	 yep. You spelt it right.
2011-10-25T15:48:00.000Z	dr_willis	XMan2012	 i can confirm same error here.
2011-10-25T15:49:00.000Z	dr_willis	XMan2012	 you need to somehow find that support lib it wants..
2011-10-25T15:50:00.000Z	dr_willis	XMan2012	 now you know why its better to use ppa's and the repositories.. then precompiled binaries.
2011-10-25T15:51:00.000Z	dr_willis	XMan2012	 cant find that lib anywhere in the repos.. you may have to use source. or find a ppa
2011-10-25T15:53:00.000Z	dr_willis	XMan2012	 that url is using wine to run it.. try it and see..
