2009-09-29T04:54:00.000Z	ubox		can anyone guess why i can't open /sys/devices/temperature/<insert file here> , i get an error saying the file does not exist but the thumbnail in nautilus shows different text for each. and i am doing so as root, via both gedit and vi
2009-09-29T04:55:00.000Z	ubox		anovativ: system > administration > login window?
2009-09-29T04:56:00.000Z	ubox		anovativ: then accesability
2009-09-29T04:56:00.000Z	ubox		jordan_u: with gksudo gedit or vi in term as root
2009-09-29T04:58:00.000Z	ubox		jordan_u: yep, they all exist, permissions say i should be able to read/write
2009-09-29T04:58:00.000Z	ubox		jordan_u: yes
2009-09-29T04:59:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ubox	Why do you want to open them in a text editor?
2009-09-29T04:59:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ubox	They are not "real" files
2009-09-29T04:59:00.000Z	ubox		jordan_u: do adjust my minimum temp before the fan comes on
2009-09-29T04:59:00.000Z	ubox		jordan_u: *to
2009-09-29T05:00:00.000Z	ubox		jordan_u: i am using a ppc and it gets a bit warm, in an unusual way
2009-09-29T05:00:00.000Z	ubox	ctmjr	probably, i just thought it a little funny
2009-09-29T05:00:00.000Z	ubox		:)
2009-09-29T05:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ubox	Try "echo value | sudo tee /sys/devices/temperature/whatever"
2009-09-29T05:01:00.000Z	ubox		jordan_u: ok, i'll give it a shot
2009-09-29T05:02:00.000Z	ubox		jordan_u: thanks! that works
2009-09-29T05:03:00.000Z	ubox		jordan_u: now if it helps keep it cool... lol
2009-09-29T05:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ubox	Np, by the way the problem is most likely that text editors usually save to a temporary file then rename it over the old one. Since /sys is not a normal file system this doesn't work
