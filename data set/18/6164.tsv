2008-06-15T06:35:00.000Z	Vi5i1		hello
2008-06-15T06:36:00.000Z	Vi5i1		I just installed ubuntu (hardy) on my dell xps 1530
2008-06-15T06:36:00.000Z	Vi5i1		I have an nVidia card. When I go to System Administration -> Hardware drivers, I see the nvidia_new driver, already checked (under Enabled),but it says not in use.
2008-06-15T06:36:00.000Z	Vi5i1		When I unchecked it and checked it, it said it needed a reboot. and so I rebooted. But it still says not-in-use
2008-06-15T06:37:00.000Z	Vi5i1		however in this case, it doesn't seem to be doing it
2008-06-15T06:38:00.000Z	Vi5i1		do I have to manually install the driver from nvidia's site?
2008-06-15T06:40:00.000Z	Vi5i1		well, I did download the driver. Unfortunately I'm not entirely sure how to stop x running. I tried Fedora before and I did an "init 3" and then ran the driver install. however it doesn't seem to work here.
2008-06-15T06:40:00.000Z	Vi5i1		I am relatively new to Linux. My experience lies mostly with FreeBSD
2008-06-15T06:41:00.000Z	tech0007	Vi5i1	'sudo /etc/init.d/gdm restart'
2008-06-15T06:41:00.000Z	Vi5i1	tech0007	thank you. Any idea why ubuntu isn't downloading the binary drivers for nvidia?
2008-06-15T06:42:00.000Z	tech0007	Vi5i1	no. check this http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu:Hardy#Install_restricted_drivers
2008-06-15T06:57:00.000Z	tech0007	Vi5i1	http://ubuntuguide.org/wiki/Ubuntu:Hardy#Install_restricted_drivers
2008-06-15T06:57:00.000Z	Vi5i1	tech0007	already looked at that
2008-06-15T07:00:00.000Z	tech0007	Vi5i1	paste your /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2008-06-15T07:00:00.000Z	Vi5i1	tech0007	the problem is that it can't find the nvidia driver
2008-06-15T07:01:00.000Z	tech0007	Vi5i1	so ur using vesa now?
2008-06-15T07:01:00.000Z	Vi5i1	tech0007	looks like it. i'm going to install the driver manually
2008-06-15T07:02:00.000Z	tech0007	Vi5i1	add 'nv' instead of 'nvidia' xorg.conf
