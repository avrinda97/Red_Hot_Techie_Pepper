2006-08-21T13:25:00.000Z	wizard		Alt + F2 no longer brings up the run aplications
2006-08-21T13:26:00.000Z	ardchoille	wizard	What did you change?
2006-08-21T13:26:00.000Z	wizard	ardchoille	I wish I knew.
2006-08-21T13:27:00.000Z	ardchoille	wizard	Did you install xgl or compiz?
2006-08-21T13:27:00.000Z	wizard	ardchoille	nope.
2006-08-21T13:27:00.000Z	ardchoille	wizard	Open a terminal and type: gnome-panel-control --run-dialog
2006-08-21T13:28:00.000Z	wizard	ardchoille	command not found.
2006-08-21T13:29:00.000Z	ardchoille	wizard	That's why ALT+F2 doesn't work anymore.. gnome-panel-control was uninstalled ;)
2006-08-21T13:29:00.000Z	wizard	ardchoille	oh.
2006-08-21T13:29:00.000Z	wizard	ardchoille	I'll try to reinstall, then.
2006-08-21T13:31:00.000Z	wizard	ardchoille	says gnome-panel and gnome-control-center are the newest versions allready.
2006-08-21T13:32:00.000Z	ardchoille	wizard	Well, somehow gnome-panel-control isn't where it's supposed to be.
2006-08-21T13:33:00.000Z	ardchoille	wizard	You might try re-installing gnome-panel
2006-08-21T13:34:00.000Z	wizard	ardchoille	didn't change anything.  I uninstalled and reinstalled.  Still cannot access gnome-panel-control
2006-08-21T13:34:00.000Z	ardchoille	wizard	killall gnome-panel
2006-08-21T13:35:00.000Z	ardchoille	wizard	it'll re-spawn
2006-08-21T13:37:00.000Z	wizard	ardchoille	Thanks for the effort.  I'll just live with it xD
2006-08-21T13:38:00.000Z	ardchoille	wizard	Well, I would advise you to re-trace your steps and try to figure out why it isn't working.
