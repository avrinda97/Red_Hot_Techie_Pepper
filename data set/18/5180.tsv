2008-11-30T07:40:00.000Z	budz0r		hey there,  anyone know if there are drivers for the geforce 8800GT? i will be upgrading from a ati card.
2008-11-30T07:41:00.000Z	endoubt	budz0r	nvidia support is much better than ati in linux
2008-11-30T07:41:00.000Z	budz0r	endoubt	thats what i heard. will i be able to point and click my way to the correct drivers?
2008-11-30T07:42:00.000Z	endoubt	budz0r	after I did compiz with nvidia I'll never go back to ati
2008-11-30T07:42:00.000Z	endoubt	budz0r	they make it much easier
2008-11-30T07:42:00.000Z	budz0r	endoubt	rmitchell, thanks. i wanted to make sure i was making a linux friendly purchase
2008-11-30T07:43:00.000Z	endoubt	budz0r	yes, I went through hell with an x1300 too
2008-11-30T07:56:00.000Z	endoubt	budz0r	depends on your hardware
2008-11-30T07:56:00.000Z	endoubt	budz0r	I have a friend who claims that compiz works great in virtualbox
2008-11-30T07:56:00.000Z	budz0r	endoubt	wondering about games
2008-11-30T07:59:00.000Z	endoubt	budz0r	you're just asking for trouble running games in virtualbox, find a brick wall instead
2008-11-30T07:59:00.000Z	budz0r	endoubt	yeah, lol
2008-11-30T08:18:00.000Z	endoubt	budz0r	I know what you mean
2008-11-30T08:19:00.000Z	budz0r	endoubt	heck yeah lol. start there.
2008-11-30T08:27:00.000Z	budz0r	endoubt	i wonder if deleting his xorg.conf would help. it could create a new working one.
2008-11-30T08:34:00.000Z	budz0r	endoubt	me me me!
2008-11-30T08:35:00.000Z	budz0r	endoubt	:-(
2008-11-30T08:38:00.000Z	budz0r	endoubt	and the rest of  you have a good night. to the bar!
