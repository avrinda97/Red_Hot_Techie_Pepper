2009-06-10T03:40:00.000Z	Oven1		I have an ubuntu 9.04 computer hooked up to a mitsubishi wd-62327 TV through the DVI port on the TV.  My video card is an nvidia geforce 8400 gs.  Ubuntu is detecting my TV wrong and I cannot get the proper resolution.  I have tried this stuff https://wiki.ubuntu.com/X/Config/Resolution and thishttp://blog.freshnewpage.com/2008/04/26/nvidia-geforce4-420-go-on-ubuntu-804-hardy-heron/#comment-406.  But I am still stuck.  Any help would be 
2009-06-10T03:42:00.000Z	Oven1		I dont think it is the nvidia driver.  It is the monitor that is detected
2009-06-10T03:42:00.000Z	fccf	Oven1	have you tried using sudo nvidia-settings
2009-06-10T03:43:00.000Z	fccf	Oven1	^^^ see my question
2009-06-10T03:44:00.000Z	fccf	Oven1	what is the highest setting it has?
2009-06-10T03:46:00.000Z	fccf	Oven1	you might try using 1280x800 < this is the resolution that nvidia supports .. then use the format button on the tv remote to adjust for that size
2009-06-10T03:51:00.000Z	fccf	Oven1	xrandr doesn't work with nvidia == do you actually have nvidia installed ... please pastebin /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2009-06-10T03:53:00.000Z	fccf	Oven1	i'd like to see your xorg.conf
2009-06-10T03:56:00.000Z	fccf	Oven1	 give me the link for the pastebin ... url after you post
2009-06-10T03:58:00.000Z	Oven1	fccf	did you get it?
2009-06-10T03:58:00.000Z	fccf	Oven1	 you are using a custom binary... you have something I don't understand installed ... I reccommend running sudo nvidia-settings from terminal within GUI
2009-06-10T04:01:00.000Z	fccf	Oven1	are you running nvidia-settings as root?
2009-06-10T04:01:00.000Z	fccf	Oven1	there is a custom binary being used by xrandr ... I am not sure how this is working ....
2009-06-10T04:02:00.000Z	fccf	Oven1	sorry. that is commented .. line 30
2009-06-10T04:04:00.000Z	fccf	Oven1	reccommend installing nvidia-glx-new & ubuntu-restricted-extras
2009-06-10T04:05:00.000Z	fccf	Oven1	then re-running sudo nvidia-settings
2009-06-10T04:05:00.000Z	fccf	Oven1	later - btw - I am here alot
2009-06-10T05:45:00.000Z	fccf	Oven1	see my private conversation now
