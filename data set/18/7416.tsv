2008-05-04T01:58:00.000Z	Lynet	omer	What, exactly, doesn't work? And what have you tried so far?
2008-05-04T01:59:00.000Z	omer	Lynet	my graphic card is nvidia geforce4 mx 444 and i I upgraded from 7.10 to 8.04
2008-05-04T01:59:00.000Z	omer		Everything else upgraded fine, but every time I install the Nvidia drivers (either via Envy or manually) It asks me to restart the machine.
2008-05-04T02:00:00.000Z	omer	Lynet	When I do, they have gone again. (at start up I get the "low graphics, no graphics card detected" spiel)
2008-05-04T02:00:00.000Z	Lynet	omer	Can you give me your /etc/X11/xorg.conf and /var/log/Xorg.0.log?
2008-05-04T02:01:00.000Z	omer		ok

2008-05-04T02:03:00.000Z	Lynet	omer	What error message does it give?
