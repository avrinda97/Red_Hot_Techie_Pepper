2011-04-08T03:28:00.000Z	demonspork		Here is my setup: I have 4x 1.5TB hard drives and 3x 1TB hard drives. The plan is to use one of the 1.5TB drives as the OS drive and then configure the remaining 3 1.5TB drives in software RAID5 and the 3 1TB drives in software RAID5.  So 2 software RAID5 arrays and a single OS drive is the ultimate goal. Does anyone have any alternative suggestions or recommendations while going through this process?

2011-04-08T03:29:00.000Z	demonspork		there used to be one that said hello to whoever you were sending it to
2011-04-08T03:29:00.000Z	demonspork		it was nice

2011-04-08T03:31:00.000Z	demonspork	sjm	fileserver that might be wired in to do media playback as well as serve files to 2 or 3 other media centers in the house.  nothing extremely demanding thus the reason I don't have a dedicated RAID controller or server grade hardware
2011-04-08T03:32:00.000Z	sjm	demonspork	I'd probably use one of the 1TB drives as the OS and the rest in one big raid10 array
2011-04-08T03:33:00.000Z	demonspork	sjm	RAID10 - not familiar with that.  Will it allow me to use all of the drive space (RAID5 for all of them would cut off .5TB on the 1.5 drives because N is the smallest drive)
2011-04-08T03:36:00.000Z	sjm	demonspork	you'd set up three raid1 arrays (something like: md0=two 1.5TB drives, md1=two 1.5TB drives, md2=2 1TB drives) and then RAID0 over that (something like md3=raid0 of md0,md1,and md2) You'd have a total of 4TB, I think.
2011-04-08T03:37:00.000Z	sjm	demonspork	but it'd be one big array without the "risk" or "disadvantages" of RAID5 (google it, if you want).
2011-04-08T03:44:00.000Z	demonspork	sjm	I am looking for a solution that gives me maximum space + at least basic redundancy with the hardware I have.  I get 5TB with the setup that I proposed.  do you think any of the disadvantages of RAID5 will cause any bottlenecks in a media center computer?  it will be downloading stuff periodically and have DVD disks copied to it's drives but most of its use will be reading the data.
2011-04-08T03:46:00.000Z	sjm	demonspork	If your priority is space, then your solution is probably the one (if it's not a problem to have the two different raid disks).  IIRC, the problems with RAID5 is data integrity especially with a failed member of the RAID.
2011-04-08T03:46:00.000Z	sjm	demonspork	If the data is not "critical" and you are checking on the raid health regularly, it shouldn't be a problem.
2011-04-08T03:47:00.000Z	demonspork	sjm	so what method should I use to build the RAID5?
2011-04-08T03:48:00.000Z	sjm	demonspork	you could end up with 5.5TB if you use 1TB for OS, 4x1.5TB RAID5, and 2x1TB RAID1
2011-04-08T03:49:00.000Z	demonspork	sjm	nice.  Now which filesystem would you recommend for running on the RAID disks?
