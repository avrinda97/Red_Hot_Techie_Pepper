2010-01-01T06:50:00.000Z	Cyber_Akuma		Not really, more like I am trying to figure out why its still the main one in use today for even desktop work
2010-01-01T06:52:00.000Z	Cyber_Akuma		... the gui I guess? XD
2010-01-01T06:52:00.000Z	Cyber_Akuma		Since apparently its not the apps
2010-01-01T06:53:00.000Z	Cyber_Akuma		Ubuntu.... Isn't that like an African or something like that word meaning togetherness?
2010-01-01T06:55:00.000Z	Cyber_Akuma		BTW, anybody here boot ubuntu and other distros at once? Was wondering if there is a way to make it so grub2 won't have problems if distros other than ubuntu update their kernel, since it seems to need to point to the kernel directly
2010-01-01T06:56:00.000Z	Cyber_Akuma		Yeah but then THAT disto will aldo triple boot
2010-01-01T06:56:00.000Z	Cyber_Akuma		also*
2010-01-01T06:56:00.000Z	Cyber_Akuma		Its a laptop and I have three OSes on it, not really possible unfortunately
2010-01-01T06:57:00.000Z	Cyber_Akuma		WIn7/Ubuntu/OpenSUSE
2010-01-01T06:58:00.000Z	Cyber_Akuma		There is no way I could, for example, make grub point to a config file that the distro itself can update and let THAT tell it where the kernel/everything is? Sorry if that makes no sense
2010-01-01T06:59:00.000Z	mka	Cyber_Akuma	Dr_Willis, what if there is one bootloader at the MBR and then grub2 use the /vmlinuz and /initrd symbolic links that would point to the latest kernel versions?
2010-01-01T07:01:00.000Z	Cyber_Akuma	mka	I .... don't know what that means, sorry, im still learning linux. Symbolic Links I mean.... I guess ill have to see once I reinstall opnsuse and ubuntu
2010-01-01T07:01:00.000Z	mka	Cyber_Akuma	a symbolic link is simply a shortcut
2010-01-01T07:02:00.000Z	Cyber_Akuma	mka	I see
2010-01-01T07:11:00.000Z	Cyber_Akuma	mka	sleep should work
2010-01-01T07:12:00.000Z	mka	Cyber_Akuma	I need something that will be powered off
2010-01-01T07:14:00.000Z	mka	Cyber_Akuma	**banging head against the desk**, damn, damn, damn
2010-01-01T07:14:00.000Z	mka	Cyber_Akuma	yes, I have been running this laptop with no HDD for about 4 days now
