2009-09-22T19:18:00.000Z	crackheadjunky	ranasco	video card?
2009-09-22T19:19:00.000Z	crackheadjunky	ranasco	generally, i like ubuntu, or debian, but it really depends. sometimes ubuntu isnt the best route... i have tried 8 different distros
2009-09-22T19:19:00.000Z	crackheadjunky	ranasco	i can tell you that ubuntu doesnt play well with ati, then again, no linux os does. it takes a bit to get it just right. if its intel, or nvidia its alot easier
2009-09-22T19:21:00.000Z	crackheadjunky	ranasco	then your fine. go with ubuntu
2009-09-22T19:21:00.000Z	crackheadjunky	ranasco	anything lts for someone that isnt the most intelligent, or willing to learn
