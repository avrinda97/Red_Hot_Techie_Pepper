2009-07-12T10:42:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ricardo_	What problem are you having?
2009-07-12T10:43:00.000Z	ricardo_	Jordan_U	i cannot enter to windows, my grub is ok, i only get "starting up" and a beep
2009-07-12T10:43:00.000Z	ricardo_	Jordan_U	but, it seems to be that windows booted was corrupted :S
2009-07-12T10:45:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ricardo_	Is windows the first partition on the drive?
2009-07-12T10:46:00.000Z	ricardo_	Jordan_U	yes, it is /dev/sda1
2009-07-12T11:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ricardo_	If you do decide to re-install windows remember that your data is still acessable from Ubuntu
2009-07-12T11:02:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ricardo_	So copy anything important before you whipe it out
2009-07-12T11:04:00.000Z	Jordan_U	ricardo_	Realize that Fixmbr will remove grub. it's easy to put restore grub though
