2010-11-22T15:18:00.000Z	sacarlson	otherjoe	that sounds correct,  being I havn't used bridge in some time but if you bridge two interface you can still only have at most one ip address
2010-11-22T15:19:00.000Z	otherjoe	sacarlson	so only assign value to br0, correct?
2010-11-22T15:19:00.000Z	sacarlson	otherjoe	yes that sounds correct
2010-11-22T15:19:00.000Z	otherjoe	sacarlson	you would figure you could do like br1, br2
2010-11-22T15:20:00.000Z	otherjoe	sacarlson	thank you very much
2010-11-22T15:20:00.000Z	sacarlson	otherjoe	I guess you could if you had like 4 interface and wanted to bridge between them as two pairs
2010-11-22T15:23:00.000Z	otherjoe	sacarlson	hmm that does not sound so use full. don't think you can even add  some aliases to br0?
2010-11-22T15:24:00.000Z	otherjoe	sacarlson	is the who point  of using virtual machines, I want to gie each one a static ip
2010-11-22T15:24:00.000Z	sacarlson	otherjoe	you could give your ip a name?
2010-11-22T15:25:00.000Z	otherjoe	sacarlson	heh not I mean, have the same interface answer to multi ip's
2010-11-22T15:25:00.000Z	sacarlson	otherjoe	ok I have done that before but never with a bridge
2010-11-22T15:25:00.000Z	sacarlson	otherjoe	but maybe you can
2010-11-22T15:26:00.000Z	sacarlson	otherjoe	vnet?
2010-11-22T15:26:00.000Z	otherjoe	sacarlson	I was just trying to setup kvm on ubuntu with multi static ip's
2010-11-22T15:27:00.000Z	otherjoe	sacarlson	thank you again for pointing me in the right direction. I guess I will have to play with it and see if I can add more ip's
2010-11-22T15:29:00.000Z	sacarlson	otherjoe	did you read this https://help.ubuntu.com/community/KVM/Networking
2010-11-22T15:30:00.000Z	otherjoe	sacarlson	yes I did however, it was not clear if I kept eth0 or just used br0 instead.
2010-11-22T15:30:00.000Z	otherjoe	sacarlson	I will just try it now with only br0
