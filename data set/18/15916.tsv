2005-01-10T16:19:00.000Z	liquidboy		um, i need some help with mplayer. i (think) i need it to play asx / asf files (like on www.mp3.com.au/thedry) but i installed via synaptic, and i 'open with' mplayer, but nothing happens... *help*
2005-01-10T16:20:00.000Z	liquidboy		and when i try to open it from the "apps" menu, it does nothign too
2005-01-10T16:21:00.000Z	liquidboy		is mplayer generally buggey? (i think i remember reading it somewhere in the forums) if so, is htere a better way to play asx/asf files?
2005-01-10T16:22:00.000Z	loogaroo	liquidboy	did you check if a process is created if you "click" on mplayer?
2005-01-10T16:23:00.000Z	loogaroo	liquidboy	see you a (g)mplayer process with top?
2005-01-10T16:25:00.000Z	loogaroo	liquidboy	use "ps aux | grep mplayer" for process listening
2005-01-10T16:27:00.000Z	loogaroo	liquidboy	?
2005-01-10T16:30:00.000Z	loogaroo	liquidboy	yes
2005-01-10T16:30:00.000Z	loogaroo	liquidboy	ok, this means that there is no mplayer process
2005-01-10T16:31:00.000Z	loogaroo	liquidboy	this is only the grep process
2005-01-10T16:32:00.000Z	loogaroo	liquidboy	you used it "ps aux | >>GREP<< mplayer"
2005-01-10T16:32:00.000Z	loogaroo	liquidboy	start mplayer from the terminal
2005-01-10T16:33:00.000Z	loogaroo	liquidboy	no
2005-01-10T16:34:00.000Z	loogaroo	liquidboy	type "mplayer <filename>.asf" in your terminal, I am sure mplayer will tell you the problem
2005-01-10T16:36:00.000Z	liquidboy	loogaroo	i typed in this: mplayer /home/matthew/PlayASX.ASP and it gave me the same feedback it did when i typed "mplayer" ina terminal
2005-01-10T16:38:00.000Z	loogaroo	liquidboy	.asp?
2005-01-10T16:39:00.000Z	loogaroo	liquidboy	is .asp a media file? I think its a web dokument
2005-01-10T17:08:00.000Z	loogaroo	liquidboy	have you tried to install mplayer from source
