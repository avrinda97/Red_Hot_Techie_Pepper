2008-09-20T03:50:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Ward1983	what does ffs stand for ask a question if you have one
2008-09-20T03:50:00.000Z	Ward1983	Pirate_Hunter	i cant type that in full here lol at least not the second word
2008-09-20T03:51:00.000Z	Ward1983	Pirate_Hunter	for ... sakes :p
2008-09-20T03:51:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Ward1983	:) ok than forget i asked
2008-09-20T03:51:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Ward1983	but have you actually got a question
2008-09-20T03:51:00.000Z	Ward1983	Pirate_Hunter	its more of a habit, dunno where i picked it up
2008-09-20T03:52:00.000Z	Ward1983	Pirate_Hunter	yep i asked it a few times allready, here goes again:
2008-09-20T03:53:00.000Z	Ward1983	Pirate_Hunter	i want to install grug on teh disk i choose, and i know i need to click advanced for that in the last window before it starts copying at installation, only i dunno what to type there anymore ( /dev/sdX ? )
2008-09-20T03:54:00.000Z	Ward1983	Pirate_Hunter	grub that is offcourse, not grug lol
2008-09-20T03:54:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Ward1983	man fdisk should help you find out how to look at your hd and allow you to chosoe the write one but you're going to have to do some reading also look at ubotu message on installing grub
2008-09-20T03:55:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Ward1983	oh and i thought at first you meant installing drug until i corrected myself cause it made no sense yet made me smirk
2008-09-20T03:58:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Ward1983	if you dont stop you will get kicked
2008-09-20T03:58:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Ward1983	what i told you to do should help you
2008-09-20T04:00:00.000Z	Ward1983	Pirate_Hunter	thanx for trying to help but what you told me is unrelated to my question, as my question was about a window / screen of the installation process
2008-09-20T04:03:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	Ward1983	self correcting your errors i understood that the question was that you didnt know what to type in which case you didnt know the hd to use considering hds are in alphabetical order i.e. hda (1hd), hdb(2nd hd), hdc(3rd hd), it shouldnt be hard for you to work out which hd to use but to make sure you shouldve read fdisk as fdisk -l lists your current hds, so i believe what i told you wasnt unrelated to your question
2008-09-20T04:05:00.000Z	Ward1983	Pirate_Hunter	well i know the HD i need to install to is sde
