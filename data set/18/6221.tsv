2008-09-11T08:13:00.000Z	bringatowel	Meshezabeel	have you installed Sun Java and the Sun Java browser plugin?
2008-09-11T08:14:00.000Z	Meshezabeel	bringatowel	yes
2008-09-11T08:14:00.000Z	bringatowel	Meshezabeel	are you running 32 or 64 bit?
2008-09-11T08:15:00.000Z	Meshezabeel	bringatowel	actually, how do I double check to see if I have the firefox java plugin, I have javaws on my computer, so I thought that is all I needed
2008-09-11T08:16:00.000Z	bringatowel	Meshezabeel	it's in Add/Remove, idk what javaws is though
2008-09-11T08:16:00.000Z	Meshezabeel		also, how do I tell if I'm running 32bit or 64bit, it's been a while since I installed it, so don't remember which one I finally installed
2008-09-11T08:17:00.000Z	Meshezabeel	bringatowel	javaws is what is needed to launch the jnlp applications
2008-09-11T08:18:00.000Z	bringatowel	Meshezabeel	well if the Java browser plugin will let you install it, then you have 32 bit, it wont then you have 64 bit ;)
2008-09-11T08:18:00.000Z	bringatowel	Meshezabeel	hmm well iirc some websites that use .jnlp work for me just using sun java + browser plugin
2008-09-11T08:20:00.000Z	Meshezabeel	bringatowel	does this site work for you? You can make up any name you want: http://tinyurl.com/5db9xq
2008-09-11T08:21:00.000Z	bringatowel	Meshezabeel	yeah it looks like it :)
2008-09-11T08:22:00.000Z	Meshezabeel	bringatowel	uname -a suggests that I am running 64-bit version
2008-09-11T08:23:00.000Z	bringatowel	Meshezabeel	that might be more difficult then, i think you need to install the 32bit version of java, but i have not tried that before
2008-09-11T08:23:00.000Z	Meshezabeel	bringatowel	hmm, for me, I asks me if I want to open with Java Webstart, I say yes, it downloads it but then doesn't seem to do anything else
2008-09-11T08:25:00.000Z	Meshezabeel		okay, thanks bringatowel, at least I kind of have an idea what is causing the problem
2008-09-11T08:25:00.000Z	bringatowel	Meshezabeel	yeah that might be because the browser plugin doesn't seem to be compatible with 64bit java, you might want to do a search for installing 32bit java in 64bit linux
2008-09-11T08:26:00.000Z	bringatowel	Meshezabeel	sure, you saw that link from ubottu right?
2008-09-11T08:26:00.000Z	Meshezabeel	bringatowel	oh, no thanks :) and thanks IdleOne
