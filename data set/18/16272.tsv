2005-03-28T16:46:00.000Z	inphlict		Can someone help me pls?
2005-03-28T16:46:00.000Z	inphlict		I installed xmms and it doesn't run my mp3s
2005-03-28T16:46:00.000Z	inphlict		it froze
2005-03-28T16:47:00.000Z	andrewski	inphlict	or mpd. :)
2005-03-28T16:48:00.000Z	andrewski	inphlict	did you try running xmms in a terminal to see what output it gives?  it might have some useful output.
2005-03-28T16:48:00.000Z	andrewski	inphlict	and you can paste the output to #paste
2005-03-28T16:50:00.000Z	andrewski	inphlict	well, does xmms start up when you run it?
2005-03-28T16:50:00.000Z	andrewski	inphlict	ok, try playing an mp3 and get it to freeze; at that point, there should be some output.
2005-03-28T16:51:00.000Z	andrewski	inphlict	why not? :)
2005-03-28T16:56:00.000Z	andrewski	inphlict	did you install libmikmod2?
2005-03-28T16:56:00.000Z	andrewski	inphlict	i thought you said "libmikmod.so.2 not found"???
2005-03-28T16:57:00.000Z	andrewski	inphlict	and it still freezes?
2005-03-28T16:57:00.000Z	andrewski	inphlict	well, i dunno then.  i don't use xmms because i don't like it. :P
2005-03-28T16:58:00.000Z	andrewski	inphlict	but, i might suggest you try another player; there are many with merit over xmms.
2005-03-29T17:02:00.000Z	andrewski	inphlict	you need to update the menu.
2005-03-29T10:16:00.000Z	andrewski	inphlict	why not use gimp?
2005-03-29T10:17:00.000Z	andrewski	inphlict	it's very similar and much easier to use in linux.  wine can be a pain.
2005-03-29T10:18:00.000Z	andrewski	inphlict	you could use older versions of gimp?
