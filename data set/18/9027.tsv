2007-06-09T14:25:00.000Z	Kenth		does anyone know why tftpd-hpa wouldn't be running after installing via apt?
2007-06-09T14:26:00.000Z	khermans	Kenth	sudo /etc/init.d/tftpd-hpa restart ?
2007-06-09T14:26:00.000Z	Kenth	khermans	no output, no action from that.  i think it's supposed to start from openbsd-inetd
2007-06-09T14:27:00.000Z	khermans	Kenth	oh check your inetd config
2007-06-09T14:27:00.000Z	Kenth	khermans	there was no entry in /etc/inetd.conf for it, so i added one, although just by copying the line above and changing the bin and options.  but restarting inetd doesn't seem to have any effect
2007-06-09T14:29:00.000Z	khermans	Kenth	it should be in init.d like i said
2007-06-09T14:30:00.000Z	khermans	Kenth	http://packages.ubuntu.com/cgi-bin/search_contents.pl?searchmode=filelist&word=tftpd-hpa&version=feisty&arch=i386
2007-06-09T14:31:00.000Z	khermans	Kenth	right, so start it, and make sure you dont have any other tftpd servers installed
2007-06-09T14:32:00.000Z	khermans	Kenth	what is the ouput?
2007-06-09T14:35:00.000Z	khermans	Kenth	look at the script and maybe figure out why
2007-06-09T14:42:00.000Z	khermans	Kenth	it is common
2007-06-09T14:43:00.000Z	khermans	Kenth	heh you ever try DRBL /
2007-06-09T14:43:00.000Z	khermans	Kenth	i would do that rather than your hack to create a custom thin client
2007-06-09T14:44:00.000Z	Kenth	khermans	- no this is my first attempt.  all the ubuntu documentation pointed to ltsp-server
2007-06-09T14:44:00.000Z	khermans	Kenth	yeah i know -- people should be trying DRBL
2007-06-09T14:48:00.000Z	khermans	Kenth	no
2007-06-09T14:59:00.000Z	khermans	Kenth	/dev/cdrom
2007-06-09T15:00:00.000Z	Kenth	khermans	in VLC media player, should File > Open Disc > then changing the device to /dev/cdrom play a dvd?
