2006-12-10T11:21:00.000Z	kerik	drkm	prepare for the easiest install in a lifetime..
2006-12-10T11:22:00.000Z	drkm		lol
2006-12-10T11:22:00.000Z	kerik	drkm	are you just wanting to install a workstation?
2006-12-10T11:23:00.000Z	kerik	drkm	cause I have never done it before and I chose the OEM...30 min later I was done..
2006-12-10T11:23:00.000Z	drkm	kerik	are there different install types?
2006-12-10T11:23:00.000Z	kerik	drkm	yeah....there are the OEM and a server version
2006-12-10T11:24:00.000Z	drkm	kerik	is the difference that server just comes with apache etc as default?
2006-12-10T11:24:00.000Z	kerik	drkm	I have no experience with the others....I know the server version is text only. If you choose a server install and choose LAMP it will install apache mysql and php
2006-12-10T11:25:00.000Z	kerik	drkm	but the OEM is the one I am using as a first timer...it works like a breeze
2006-12-10T11:25:00.000Z	kerik	drkm	but then again...I am a total newb..
2006-12-10T11:25:00.000Z	drkm	kerik	ahh yeah ok.. i'm going to use oem..
