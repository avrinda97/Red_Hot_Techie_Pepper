2006-07-19T09:33:00.000Z	planetcall		a small problem here ! I am unable to make a link to rssowl (http://www.rssowl.org/) on my desktop. The link/launcher are not working and throwing a java exception. Though I can fire the app from the installation directory. Its a small file. Please guide me with it
2006-07-19T09:34:00.000Z	planetcall		someone on my question ?
2006-07-19T09:36:00.000Z	planetcall		ln -s  run.sh ~/Desktop/rssowl  creates a link but it doesnt launches it
2006-07-19T09:37:00.000Z	planetcall		I dont really want to say.........but I had no problem using this java app on window :( sad to say so
2006-07-19T09:37:00.000Z	richiefrich	planetcall	 what are u doing?
2006-07-19T09:38:00.000Z	planetcall	richiefrich	creating a link/launcher to rssowl application (http://www.rssowl.org/)
2006-07-19T09:38:00.000Z	richiefrich	planetcall	then why not add it to your PATH ?
2006-07-19T09:39:00.000Z	planetcall	richiefrich	making a simple link never required so many hassles. :( dont you think its a little too much for a simple application to be added to path ?
2006-07-19T09:40:00.000Z	planetcall	richiefrich	if this is the last option, i will do it anyway
2006-07-19T09:40:00.000Z	richiefrich	planetcall	 where is the  app u are lanuching ?  /usr/bin ?  /usr/local/bin ?
