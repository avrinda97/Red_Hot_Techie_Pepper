2009-10-03T09:16:00.000Z	alokito	washburnello	probably hardware support problem

2009-10-03T09:17:00.000Z	washburnello	alokito	though I don remember exactly what
2009-10-03T09:18:00.000Z	alokito	washburnello	if your system hangs after sometime you can use the noapic and acpi=off options during boot, it might help
