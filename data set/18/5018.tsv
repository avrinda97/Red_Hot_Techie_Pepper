2012-01-14T11:19:00.000Z	sheena1	dns53	i've gone into the sound manager and selected speakers. is there somewhere else i should check?
2012-01-14T11:21:00.000Z	dns53	sheena1	the alsa mixer is still there but that should be loud
2012-01-14T11:21:00.000Z	sheena1	dns53	i've turned everything in the alsa terminal program to 100%

2012-01-14T11:27:00.000Z	sheena1	dns53	all of them. checked the app volumes
2012-01-14T11:39:00.000Z	sheena1	dns53	no other ideas? i appreciate the help!
2012-01-14T11:40:00.000Z	dns53	sheena1	sorry no, perhaps it is the sound card/drivers,   you could try buying a $2 sound card
2012-01-14T11:41:00.000Z	sheena1	dns53	more info on the sound card? and any idea where to look for/find alternative drivers for it?
2012-01-14T11:41:00.000Z	dns53	sheena1	well is it built in to the motherboard?
2012-01-14T11:42:00.000Z	sheena1	dns53	sorry, i don't know how to tell, but i assume so? nothing i read said otherwise
2012-01-14T11:54:00.000Z	sheena1	dns53	sorry, i don't know how to tell if its built in, but i assume so? nothing i read said otherwise
2012-01-14T11:55:00.000Z	dns53	sheena1	it might be drivers then, not a lot you can do, my laptop had problems and then a linux kernel update fixed it
2012-01-14T11:55:00.000Z	sheena1	dns53	thats reassuring.. sigh. would another distro be any different drivers-wise?
2012-01-14T11:57:00.000Z	dns53	sheena1	perhaps but October was not that long ago, i would see if you can get a usb sound card or take your laptop to a linux geek from your loco /  linux user group and they might have a better idea
2012-01-14T11:59:00.000Z	sheena1	dns53	thanks. i'll look into the usb thing,my roommate might have one. nearest loco is ~4-5 hrs drive from here, afaik. i can try fedora for sure.
