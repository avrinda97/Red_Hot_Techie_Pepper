2005-05-22T05:05:00.000Z	jeffco	Burgundavia	happyfool, choubaka: sounds is working in flash/firefox now. Thank you. Does this mean that all sounds (midi, java, etc) will also be working too?
2005-05-22T05:06:00.000Z	Burgundavia	jeffco	might, and no idea
2005-05-23T14:46:00.000Z	Burgundavia	jeffco	add the pilot applet to your desktop
2005-05-23T14:46:00.000Z	jeffco	Burgundavia	how do i do such?
2005-05-23T14:46:00.000Z	Burgundavia	jeffco	right click on panel and choose add to panel
2005-05-23T14:47:00.000Z	Burgundavia	jeffco	then scroll down and choose pilot applet. It is an ugly black and white thing
2005-05-23T14:47:00.000Z	jeffco	Burgundavia	Ok. Done.
2005-05-23T14:47:00.000Z	Burgundavia	jeffco	no hit that syn button again
2005-05-23T14:49:00.000Z	jeffco	Burgundavia	it's not working. Just to let you know, when I hover my mouse over that pilot applet, it says, "Not connected. Restart Daemon to reconnect."
