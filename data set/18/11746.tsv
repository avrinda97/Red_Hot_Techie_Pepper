2006-07-05T08:28:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	jeff303	line 101 change it to "nvidia"

2006-07-05T08:33:00.000Z	jeff303	Jack_Sparrow	garbled video after loading the nvidia driver, so I had to reconfigure to nv
2006-07-05T08:34:00.000Z	jeff303	Jack_Sparrow	yes when I installed nvidia-glx from synaptic it prompted for that dependency, and I did install them
2006-07-05T08:35:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	jeff303	 Just trying to figure out where it all went wrong for you.. Frankly... too tired to be any good
