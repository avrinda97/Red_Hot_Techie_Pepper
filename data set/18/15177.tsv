2005-07-30T15:28:00.000Z	nubbe	useruser	I got stuff in /media
2005-07-30T15:28:00.000Z	useruser	nubbe	not with audio cds, I'll wager
2005-07-30T15:28:00.000Z	nubbe	useruser	don't know if I don't try :)
2005-07-30T15:29:00.000Z	useruser	nubbe	/media is used for mounted things - audio cds aren't mounted
2005-07-30T15:31:00.000Z	nubbe	useruser	I got /dev/hdd
2005-07-30T15:32:00.000Z	nubbe	useruser	mine mounts automagically
2005-07-30T15:32:00.000Z	useruser	nubbe	audio cds?
2005-07-30T15:32:00.000Z	nubbe	useruser	yepp, just popped it in and up it comes
2005-07-30T15:33:00.000Z	useruser	nubbe	ok, well i'm not running gnome or anything like that... just grip over ssh from another machine
2005-07-30T15:38:00.000Z	nubbe	useruser	I got 0 and 1 too
2005-07-30T15:38:00.000Z	useruser	nubbe	0 and 1?
2005-07-30T15:39:00.000Z	useruser	nubbe	oh, cdrom0 and cdrom1
2005-07-30T15:39:00.000Z	nubbe	useruser	actually I lied, got /dev/cdrom and cdrom1 only
2005-07-30T15:40:00.000Z	useruser	nubbe	ok. well i'm really none the wiser about this :(
2005-07-30T15:40:00.000Z	nubbe	useruser	got /media/cdrom and 0 and 1
2005-07-30T15:40:00.000Z	useruser	nubbe	thing is i have no idea why you have those things and i don't. until i find that out, i can't fix anything
2005-07-30T15:40:00.000Z	useruser	nubbe	plus i don't know why my /dev/cdrom symlink is deleted and not recreated on reboot
2005-07-30T15:41:00.000Z	nubbe	useruser	sorry, my knowledge is pretty shallow about those things
