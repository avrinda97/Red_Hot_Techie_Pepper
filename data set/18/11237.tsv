2006-08-25T09:38:00.000Z	Eppcott		Hello, I hope someone here can help me with my problem.
2006-08-25T09:39:00.000Z	Eppcott		Firefox will no longer start for me on Ubuntu.
2006-08-25T09:39:00.000Z	marshall_	Eppcott	 do you have extensions on it?
2006-08-25T09:39:00.000Z	marshall_		lol
2006-08-25T09:39:00.000Z	Eppcott		I did, yes.
2006-08-25T09:40:00.000Z	marshall_	Eppcott	 for soem reason firefox isnt doing very well with extensions right now, i think if you somehow make a new profile, or reinstall firefox it should be okay
2006-08-25T09:40:00.000Z	marshall_	Eppcott	 you can back up your bookmarks and stuff
2006-08-25T09:41:00.000Z	Eppcott	marshall_	I'm not too concerned about losing my bookmarks, since they're on del.icio.us anyway.
2006-08-25T09:41:00.000Z	Eppcott		but do I have to uninstall Firefox in order to reinstall?
2006-08-25T09:45:00.000Z	Eppcott	marshall_	I'm assuming I can uninstall it with Symantic Package Manager and then use that to reinstall it as well.
2006-08-25T09:47:00.000Z	Eppcott	marshall_	should I tell Symantic Package Manager to "Mark For Removal" or "Mark For Complete Removal"?
2006-08-25T09:48:00.000Z	marshall_	Eppcott	 i think complete removal would be best
2006-08-25T09:49:00.000Z	marshall_	Eppcott	 that way it wipes all your configurations and profiles
2006-08-25T09:49:00.000Z	Eppcott	marshall_	Thanks.
2006-08-25T09:49:00.000Z	marshall_	Eppcott	 np
2006-08-25T09:50:00.000Z	marshall_		does anybody know if its possible to get gmailfs working?
2006-08-25T09:55:00.000Z	Eppcott	marshall_	I did a complete uninstall of Firefox, reinstalled it, and it still acts the same way
2006-08-25T09:55:00.000Z	marshall_	Eppcott	 what does it do?
