2006-12-13T17:14:00.000Z	SoftIce		how do I load eg: to sysutil on freebsd
2006-12-13T17:14:00.000Z	Gumby	SoftIce	your route is probably wrong
2006-12-13T17:14:00.000Z	SoftIce	Gumby	my route is not wrong, because even if you dont add a default gw, or any route you should still ping the gateway
2006-12-13T17:15:00.000Z	Gumby	SoftIce	thats not true at all.  if yor route is wrong the pc doesnt know how to get to the gateway
2006-12-13T17:15:00.000Z	SoftIce	Gumby	what? ive added an ip address, you should be able to ping any ip on the local lan, eeven the gateway
2006-12-13T17:16:00.000Z	Gumby	SoftIce	ok, thats great. how about the routing table
2006-12-13T17:17:00.000Z	Gumby	SoftIce	well, if you know it all (and it seems you do) just open up a console and type net(tab tab)  see what shows up
2006-12-13T17:19:00.000Z	Gumby	SoftIce	www.google.com will help you find your answers quite easily
2006-12-13T17:19:00.000Z	Gumby	SoftIce	lspci or lshw
