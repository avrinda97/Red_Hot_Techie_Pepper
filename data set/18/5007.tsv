2009-01-01T12:14:00.000Z	steven		hello.
2009-01-01T12:14:00.000Z	steven		so, i installed the very latest Ubuntu, downloaded from the torrent tonight
2009-01-01T12:14:00.000Z	steven		and first thing, it cant access my second wifi network card to get online
2009-01-01T12:14:00.000Z	dotslash	steven	congratulations.
2009-01-01T12:16:00.000Z	dotslash	steven	sounds like you've come to a conclusion.
2009-01-01T12:17:00.000Z	dotslash	steven	well, when you have failing hardware, ubuntu isn't really to blame.
2009-01-01T12:17:00.000Z	steven	dotslash	well im certainly not installing Ubuntu on my mac. that defeats the purpose of having a second computer
2009-01-01T12:19:00.000Z	dotslash	steven	you haven't exactly stated a problem.
2009-01-01T12:19:00.000Z	steven	dotslash	it saw my network and tried to connect, yet it said it could not connect
2009-01-01T12:20:00.000Z	dotslash	steven	you are not making any sense, you're coming up with two very different problems.
2009-01-01T12:21:00.000Z	steven	dotslash	the specific problem is that before this i was on Windows. just an hour ago in fact. and the internet worked from Windows. and i installed Ubuntu right over it because my winxp had viruses, and now Ubuntu cannot access the internet
2009-01-01T12:21:00.000Z	steven	dotslash	it even says im using the proprietary drivers that are specific to my network card
2009-01-01T12:22:00.000Z	dotslash	steven	i see.
2009-01-01T12:22:00.000Z	dotslash	steven	and what options does it give you
2009-01-01T12:22:00.000Z	dotslash	steven	what sort of connection is this?
2009-01-01T12:23:00.000Z	steven	dotslash	wireless
2009-01-01T12:23:00.000Z	dotslash	steven	wep/wpa?
