2008-10-15T12:26:00.000Z	baudthief		it keeps thinking the name is a switch
2008-10-15T12:28:00.000Z	DCPom	baudthief	try quotes
2008-10-15T12:28:00.000Z	baudthief	DCPom	nope, don't work, both single and double :P
2008-10-15T12:28:00.000Z	baudthief		wow this is quite a pickle lol
2008-10-15T12:28:00.000Z	DCPom		use mv
2008-10-15T12:29:00.000Z	baudthief	DCPom	I am using MV
2008-10-15T12:29:00.000Z	baudthief		*mv
2008-10-15T12:29:00.000Z	baudthief		mv "--folder" folder2
2008-10-15T12:29:00.000Z	DCPom		how did it get two dashes in the first place??
