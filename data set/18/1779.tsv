2010-11-12T22:10:00.000Z	lithpr		is there a special way to reformat a hard-drive so that it is not recognized as msdos1.  The install process was supposed to use EXT4...
2010-11-12T22:10:00.000Z	ikonia	lithpr	the partition type and file systeem are two different things
2010-11-12T22:11:00.000Z	ikonia	lithpr	why do you want to do that
2010-11-12T22:12:00.000Z	ikonia	lithpr	ok, so you probably just need to re-install Ubuntu depending on what your friend did
2010-11-12T22:13:00.000Z	ikonia	lithpr	are you doing a wubi install ?
2010-11-12T22:14:00.000Z	ikonia	lithpr	from the livecd can you please paste the output of "sudo fdisk -l" please
2010-11-12T22:14:00.000Z	ikonia	lithpr	use a pastebin
2010-11-12T22:24:00.000Z	ikonia	lithpr	`yes
2010-11-12T22:25:00.000Z	lithpr	ikonia	thank you for your help.  do you see anything weird with that output?
2010-11-12T22:25:00.000Z	ikonia	lithpr	that looks a fine partition table, no problems there
2010-11-12T22:25:00.000Z	ikonia	lithpr	it looks like your install just isn't working
2010-11-12T22:26:00.000Z	ikonia	lithpr	nothing
2010-11-12T22:27:00.000Z	ikonia	lithpr	I think I have an answer
2010-11-12T22:28:00.000Z	ikonia	lithpr	look at your partition start and end blocks, there is n overlap
2010-11-12T22:28:00.000Z	ikonia	lithpr	re-create your partitions
2010-11-12T22:32:00.000Z	lithpr	ikonia	i am trying my 4th install, lets see if i get lucky :P
2010-11-12T22:33:00.000Z	ikonia	lithpr	pay close attention to the partition start/end boundries
2010-11-12T22:33:00.000Z	ikonia	lithpr	don't use an extended partition for no reason
