2007-08-03T11:12:00.000Z	macogw	crazyman	nano, vi, the non-gui-version of emacs
2007-08-03T11:12:00.000Z	macogw	crazyman	make that vim before i get yelled at
2007-08-03T11:13:00.000Z	macogw	crazyman	sudo gedit file
2007-08-03T11:47:00.000Z	macogw	crazyman	why are you using system > networking? thats if you want a static setting. by default, its set for roaming
2007-08-03T11:47:00.000Z	macogw	crazyman	just use the applet in the top left corner and pick which network you want
2007-08-03T11:48:00.000Z	macogw	crazyman	oh.  uncheck the "roaming" box then
2007-08-05T10:08:00.000Z	macogw	crazyman	yes
2007-08-05T10:08:00.000Z	crazyman	macogw	is there a fix?
2007-08-05T10:08:00.000Z	macogw	crazyman	hit ctrl alt f7 to go back to the first session, then ctrl alt f9 to go back to the 2nd one, and it should start working again, i think
2007-08-05T10:08:00.000Z	macogw	crazyman	its a workaround...
2007-08-05T10:14:00.000Z	crazyman	macogw	that worked but its a pain, no other ideas to fix it?
2007-08-05T10:15:00.000Z	macogw	crazyman	im sorry, what was the problem again?
2007-08-05T10:15:00.000Z	crazyman	macogw	when you switch users the mouse stops working
2007-08-05T10:16:00.000Z	macogw	crazyman	no, sorry. its an outstanding bug, possibly with resource allocation in X11, that i hope will be fixed in Gutsy
2007-08-05T10:17:00.000Z	crazyman	macogw	im kinda of new to this, is gutsy the new release? and when is it coming out
2007-08-05T10:17:00.000Z	macogw	crazyman	oct 18
