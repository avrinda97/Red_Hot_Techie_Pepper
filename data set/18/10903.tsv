2009-01-17T07:03:00.000Z	varun		guys how do you change what interface the system sounds use?
2009-01-17T07:04:00.000Z	varun		like the sound in rythmbox works, but not the sound from the system (eg Login sound) or firefox, any ideas?
2009-01-17T07:05:00.000Z	vertana	varun	does the sound work on other program even when rhythmbox is not on?
2009-01-17T07:06:00.000Z	vertana	varun	Sometimes Gstreamer conflicts with some other sound systems (This happens to me if  I have VLC up and then try to play a song on rhythmbox with VLC still up)
2009-01-17T07:07:00.000Z	varun	vertana	it dosnt work with rythmbox turned off
2009-01-17T07:07:00.000Z	varun	vertana	i think it is an interface issue,
2009-01-17T07:08:00.000Z	varun	vertana	like that is, only one of the interface works, in Soud Preferences in gnome, sound only works if i put it in HDA Intel OSS
2009-01-17T07:08:00.000Z	varun	vertana	on the other interfaces, it makes a clicky noise
2009-01-17T07:08:00.000Z	varun	vertana	and thats exactly the same noise i get with ubuntu system sounds such as the login sound
2009-01-17T07:09:00.000Z	vertana	varun	So, rhythmbox works fine for sound, but NOTHING else does?
2009-01-17T07:10:00.000Z	varun	vertana	oh no most of the applications works with sound like vlc..etc....but sound dosnt work from firefox and system sounds (again such as when i login the noise dosnt work)
2009-01-17T07:10:00.000Z	varun	vertana	i hear clicky noises instead
2009-01-17T07:10:00.000Z	vertana	varun	I don't know off the top of my head but give me a few minutes and hopefully the 'net helps us here :)
2009-01-17T07:12:00.000Z	varun	vertana	i remember reading an article about something similar, it went on about the sound card not supporting a frequency....i'll try to find that link, not sure if i can
2009-01-17T07:14:00.000Z	vertana	varun	under Sound preferences make sure all sound tests work. IF not select proper system and then test to make sure all work.
2009-01-17T07:15:00.000Z	varun	vertana	yeap they are all working
2009-01-17T07:15:00.000Z	vertana	varun	Ok, give me one second to help mib.
2009-01-17T07:16:00.000Z	vertana	varun	OK, let me know if that works for you :)
