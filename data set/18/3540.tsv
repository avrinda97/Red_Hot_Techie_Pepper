2009-09-17T15:34:00.000Z	norkakn	chingus	what graphics card do you have?
2009-09-17T15:40:00.000Z	norkakn	chingus	0MB :)
2009-09-17T15:40:00.000Z	norkakn	chingus	You have an integrated graphics card, so it uses you main RAM
2009-09-17T15:40:00.000Z	chingus	norkakn	is it really that poor?
2009-09-17T15:41:00.000Z	chingus	norkakn	in that case would it be like 1 GB?
2009-09-17T15:41:00.000Z	norkakn	chingus	 It's fine for a laptop, not so hot for gaming.  Is this a laptop or desktop?
2009-09-17T15:41:00.000Z	chingus	norkakn	desktop.
2009-09-17T15:41:00.000Z	chingus	norkakn	I wanted it for Beryl and ubuntu effects.
2009-09-17T15:42:00.000Z	norkakn	chingus	try it out, I have integrated graphics on my laptop, and I'm still able to run a bit of the eye candy.  If it isn't fast enough for you, you could pick up a few year old graphics card for really cheap
2009-09-17T15:42:00.000Z	chingus	norkakn	I am planning on buying a good graphics card, does this look good? Powercolor ATi Radeon HD3450 512MB AGP Display Card: AGP x8, 64-bit GDDR2, VGA+DVI+S-Video Ou
2009-09-17T15:45:00.000Z	chingus	norkakn	the desktop effects don't work at all...
2009-09-17T15:47:00.000Z	chingus	norkakn	so if I install the Powercolor ATi Radeon HD3450 512MB AGP Display Card: AGP x8, 64-bit GDDR2, VGA+DVI+S-Video Out it is better than the integrated chipset I have now?
2009-09-17T15:49:00.000Z	norkakn	chingus	yeah, that would work, probably almost any would work.  You should check with the product that you want to install and see what their system requirements are
2009-09-17T15:49:00.000Z	chingus	norkakn	sweet thanks.
