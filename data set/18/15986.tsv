2004-12-12T07:38:00.000Z	Orcrist		anyone had a problem with mplayer under warty?
2004-12-12T07:38:00.000Z	Orcrist		it starts up and then disappears... it never fully intitializes
2004-12-12T07:39:00.000Z	jcole	Orcrist	fyi, mplayer/mencoder from debian marillat sources have always been buggy (just learned this myself)... best to rebuild from source... mplayer sources are debian friendly
2004-12-12T07:40:00.000Z	Orcrist	jcole	thank you
2004-12-12T07:43:00.000Z	jcole		night ogra
2004-12-12T07:44:00.000Z	jcole	Orcrist	i think you can even actually "apt-get source mplayer" from ubuntu sources...
2004-12-12T07:45:00.000Z	Orcrist		well jcole, I used synaptic
2004-12-12T07:45:00.000Z	Orcrist		and it said it was an ubuntu package
2004-12-12T07:45:00.000Z	Orcrist		so won't that be compiled from the same sources?
2004-12-12T07:48:00.000Z	jcole	Orcrist	well mplayer being "freely distributed" has always been a hairy thing... that's why most distros do not include it... compiling from sources always works for me... i need to learn if the wizards at ubuntu have a trick for mplayer like they do with java
2004-12-12T07:49:00.000Z	jcole		you *cannot* successfully encode movies in simple divx with marillat sources... you have to rebuild from source
2004-12-12T07:50:00.000Z	jcole		alot of the lavc codec stuff does not work
2004-12-12T07:50:00.000Z	jcole		unless you recompile of course
2004-12-12T07:51:00.000Z	Orcrist		jcole
2004-12-12T07:51:00.000Z	Orcrist		oen more question
2004-12-12T07:52:00.000Z	Orcrist		should I uninstall the mplayer I've installed before compiling these sources?
2004-12-12T07:52:00.000Z	Orcrist		btw apt-get source mplayer worked just fine
2004-12-12T07:53:00.000Z	jcole	Orcrist	try "apt-get build-dep mplayer" to see if you have what it takes to compile it
