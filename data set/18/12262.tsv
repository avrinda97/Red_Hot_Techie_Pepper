2007-05-28T14:03:00.000Z	jin	ikonia	yea, when I resize window for example, it takes fraction of a second to draw it. in other words, it does not draw it immediatelly

2008-12-08T16:16:00.000Z	jin	ikonia	here is the error: http://pastebin.com/m5b49b458
2008-12-08T16:16:00.000Z	ikonia	jin	it looks like it's not compatible with that version of glibc
2008-12-08T16:17:00.000Z	jin	ikonia	what do I do? install another version of glibc? or recompile songbird?
2008-12-08T16:17:00.000Z	ikonia	jin	don't install anything to do with glibc, that is core to youse system
2008-12-08T16:17:00.000Z	ikonia	jin	did you build songbird yourself
2008-12-08T16:18:00.000Z	jin	ikonia	no, I downloaded the linux .tar.gz from the official website
2008-12-08T16:18:00.000Z	ikonia	jin	log a bug with them, but precompiled binaries are rarley sane amongst multiple distros, I don't know why they build them
