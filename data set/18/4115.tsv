2009-06-09T07:39:00.000Z	sam555		i'm about to install 9.04 and I wondered how much of a 125 gb hdd should I put the swap partition?
2009-06-09T07:39:00.000Z	cabrey	sam555	how much ram do you have?
2009-06-09T07:40:00.000Z	cabrey	sam555	1gb should be good
2009-06-09T07:40:00.000Z	cabrey	sam555	what do you plan on using your system for?
2009-06-09T07:41:00.000Z	sam555	cabrey	it's someone else's laptop
2009-06-09T07:41:00.000Z	sam555	cabrey	1/2 vista 1/2 ubuntu
2009-06-09T07:42:00.000Z	cabrey	sam555	that shouldnt really matter
2009-06-09T07:42:00.000Z	cabrey	sam555	swap isnt shared between vista and ubuntu
2009-06-09T07:42:00.000Z	cabrey	sam555	ahh got ya
2009-06-09T07:43:00.000Z	cabrey	sam555	imho max swap would be 2 gb then give ~40gb / rest to /home
2009-06-09T07:44:00.000Z	sam555	cabrey	thanks much!
2009-06-10T02:08:00.000Z	cabrey	sam555	~5gb minimum
2009-06-10T02:08:00.000Z	cabrey	sam555	you can go lower, but 5gb is a good comfort level
2009-06-10T02:08:00.000Z	sam555	cabrey	is 20gb too much?
2009-06-10T02:09:00.000Z	cabrey	sam555	not at all, it will give you plenty of room to expand
2009-06-10T02:09:00.000Z	sam555	cabrey	and that was my concern
2009-06-10T02:09:00.000Z	sam555	cabrey	thanks!
