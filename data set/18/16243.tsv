2005-12-12T12:16:00.000Z	siorai		Freelovel very carefully
2005-12-12T06:38:00.000Z	siorai		why am I getting "bash: make: command not found" errors ?
2005-12-12T06:38:00.000Z	siorai		I didnt' think that was possible, I'm SURE ubuntu comes with MAKE right?
2005-12-12T06:39:00.000Z	siorai		Lemme guess liscensing crap?
2005-12-12T06:40:00.000Z	siorai		geeez
2005-12-12T06:40:00.000Z	siorai		so THAT's why none of my make commands ever worked
2005-12-12T06:40:00.000Z	siorai		Yeah, but why isn't that basic install ?
2005-12-12T06:40:00.000Z	siorai		I mean, for petes sake, that really SHOULD be bundled right?
2005-12-12T06:41:00.000Z	siorai		Yeah, but, lol, I'm not a developer, ; /
2005-12-12T06:41:00.000Z	siorai		and I've found uses for that already
2005-12-12T06:41:00.000Z	Ng	siorai	most users will never need gcc
2005-12-12T07:00:00.000Z	Ng	siorai	rpm is available in apt if you really need it, but you shouldn't really need it
2005-12-12T07:06:00.000Z	Ng	siorai	yeah, the developers of the software just release a tarball, the individual distributions then make packages
2005-12-12T07:07:00.000Z	Ng	siorai	unix is 30 years old, your argument falls down instantly :)
2005-12-12T07:10:00.000Z	Ng	siorai	there's a lot to be said for doing things the hard way - you learn a lot about how the system works. I've been doing it long enough that I appreciate ease of use more than anything now ;)
2005-12-12T07:12:00.000Z	Ng	siorai	that's a pretty bizarre argument, but ok
2005-12-12T07:13:00.000Z	Ng	siorai	and I'm saying that's a pretty bizarre argument, the easier the system is to use the more time you can spend being productive, unless your goal is to use your system just to configure it ;)
2005-12-12T07:16:00.000Z	Ng	siorai	surely linux therefore provides the best solution? the user interface is easy to use, but there is a fully fledged "geek" system underneath if you want to touch it :)
