2008-11-18T10:24:00.000Z	Randall1		k does anyone know if the Nvidia Geforce4: MX 420 is still supported
2008-11-18T10:25:00.000Z	demonspork	Randall1	there is no reason for it not to be supported
2008-11-18T10:25:00.000Z	Randall1	demonspork	when i try and enable the driver it always boots to low-graphics mode
2008-11-18T10:25:00.000Z	demonspork	Randall1	it requires the legacy drivers
2008-11-18T10:25:00.000Z	Randall1	demonspork	well in hardware drivers it shows that one is available
2008-11-18T10:26:00.000Z	demonspork	Randall1	the -legacy driver package needs to be installed
2008-11-18T10:26:00.000Z	Randall1	demonspork	how?
2008-11-18T10:26:00.000Z	demonspork	Randall1	through synaptic
2008-11-18T10:26:00.000Z	Randall1	demonspork	which one would it be
2008-11-18T10:27:00.000Z	demonspork	Randall1	I think it is nvidia-glx-legacy
2008-11-18T10:27:00.000Z	demonspork	Randall1	I am not sure, it has been a while since I messed with my box that has an MX 440 in it
2008-11-18T10:28:00.000Z	Randall1	demonspork	will there be anything i need to uninstall and after i install that what would i do
2008-11-18T10:29:00.000Z	demonspork	Randall1	uninstall any other nvidia-glx packages that are already installed
2008-11-18T10:30:00.000Z	Randall1	demonspork	none are, so after i install legacy drivers what do i do?
2008-11-18T10:31:00.000Z	demonspork	Randall1	you might be able to use the driver enabling tool to enable it
2008-11-18T10:32:00.000Z	Randall1	demonspork	well apparently nvidia-glx-legacy doesn't exist or has been obsoleted, and when i use the driver enabling tool it tells me it boots to low-graphics mode
2008-11-18T10:32:00.000Z	demonspork	Randall1	if that doesn't work you can try installing the driver manually from the nvidia website (not a super-easy process) or find someone else to help you
2008-11-18T10:33:00.000Z	Randall1	demonspork	alright thanks
