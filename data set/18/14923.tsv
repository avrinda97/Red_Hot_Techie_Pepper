2005-09-22T12:47:00.000Z	user_		any idea why?
2005-09-22T12:47:00.000Z	Madpilot	user_	have you read wikie.ubuntu.com/RootSudo?
2005-09-22T12:50:00.000Z	Madpilot	user_	http://www.ubuntulinux.org/wiki/RootSudo - typo in the first one...
2006-04-06T10:07:00.000Z	Madpilot	user_	ubotu is a fancy script running thru an IRC client
2006-04-06T10:06:00.000Z	Madpilot	user_	ubotu is a bot
2006-04-06T10:07:00.000Z	Madpilot	user_	stop it, thanks...
2006-08-10T16:19:00.000Z	Madpilot	user_	no - get the Desktop ISO
2006-08-10T16:22:00.000Z	Madpilot	user_	you install from inside the LiveCD - there's an Install icon on the desktop
2006-08-10T16:22:00.000Z	user_	Madpilot	hmm but it stops at mounting root filesystem
2006-08-10T16:23:00.000Z	Madpilot	user_	then there's something wrong with your CD - is this one you burned yourself, or a pressed one?
2006-08-10T16:23:00.000Z	user_	Madpilot	when I first install ubuntu 5 and than run that live cd, everything works perfect, so its not the cd i think
2007-02-17T12:57:00.000Z	Madpilot	user_	the install.exe thing is new, very experimental.
2007-02-17T13:02:00.000Z	Madpilot	user_	check the install.exe project pages, they might have set up an IRC channel of their own
2007-02-17T13:03:00.000Z	Madpilot	user_	mackinac gave you the URL: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/install.exe/Prototype
2007-02-17T13:06:00.000Z	Madpilot	user_	please don't paste more than two lines into the channel. thanks
