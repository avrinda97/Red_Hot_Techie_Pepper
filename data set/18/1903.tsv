2011-01-13T05:27:00.000Z	toenail		i have samba installed allready how do i know if its running i know sounds dumb
2011-01-13T05:28:00.000Z	rusty149	toenail	sudo status smbd
2011-01-13T05:37:00.000Z	rusty149	toenail	sudo stop smbd && sudo restart nmbd && sudo start nmbd
2011-01-13T05:38:00.000Z	rusty149	toenail	Are these shares on windows?
2011-01-13T05:40:00.000Z	rusty149	toenail	so you have a samba share on Ubuntu which you want to access from windows?
2011-01-13T05:41:00.000Z	rusty149	toenail	ok, pastebin your, smb.conf
2011-01-13T05:47:00.000Z	rusty149	toenail	I cannot see any shares in there. That file is huge btw, you may want to write one from scratch.
2011-01-13T05:47:00.000Z	rusty149	toenail	But just adding the share to the bottom should get it working
2011-01-13T05:53:00.000Z	rusty149	toenail	what says its shared?
2011-01-13T05:58:00.000Z	rusty149	toenail	did you do that before or after you sent the pastebin?
2011-01-13T06:00:00.000Z	rusty149	toenail	well it isn't in the config file so it won't work. I suggest renaming that one as original and using one I give you
2011-01-13T06:01:00.000Z	rusty149	toenail	yes, do you own the folder and have read/write permissions?
2011-01-13T06:03:00.000Z	rusty149	toenail	sorry, i meant the folder you want to share
2011-01-13T06:08:00.000Z	rusty149	toenail	http://paste.ubuntu.com/553425/  add the Back-Up section and add the lines in global to current global section
2011-01-13T06:09:00.000Z	rusty149	toenail	you can turn off the folder options are aswell
2011-01-13T06:12:00.000Z	rusty149	toenail	yeah that is all you need for a working samba config (more than actually :))
2011-01-13T06:14:00.000Z	rusty149	toenail	then check it with, sudo testparm
2011-01-13T06:21:00.000Z	rusty149	toenail	vista box needs to join workgroup: WORKGROUP, then reboot and wait upto 5 minutes for share to be visible.
