2008-06-23T23:41:00.000Z	vampirefrog		hi. I burned the ubuntu CD iso to a dvd, and the computer boots it but whichever option I choose from the menu, it gets stuck at the shell thingy
2008-06-23T23:41:00.000Z	vampirefrog		the prompt is (initramfs)
2008-06-23T23:42:00.000Z	wols_	vampirefrog	what harddisk controller do you have?
2008-06-23T23:42:00.000Z	vampirefrog	wols_	dunno, how do I check? I'm in winXP now
2008-06-23T23:42:00.000Z	wols_	vampirefrog	device manager
2008-06-23T23:43:00.000Z	wols_	vampirefrog	for specifics ask a windows channel
2008-06-23T23:43:00.000Z	vampirefrog	wols_	via busmaster ide controller? is that it?
2008-06-23T23:44:00.000Z	wols_	vampirefrog	your ubuntu CD shows you an error before you get the prompt. what is it?
2008-06-23T23:44:00.000Z	vampirefrog	wols_	err it doesn't actually
2008-06-23T23:44:00.000Z	wols_	vampirefrog	I doN't believe you
2008-06-23T23:44:00.000Z	vampirefrog	wols_	I'll have another look mate. be right back
2008-06-23T23:48:00.000Z	vampirefrog	wols_	ok here's what I did. I booted the dvd again, chose 'check cd for defects' option then got the ash shell again
2008-06-23T23:49:00.000Z	vampirefrog	wols_	then I pressed CTRL+D and it said
2008-06-23T23:49:00.000Z	vampirefrog	wols_	then press any key to reboot
2008-06-23T23:50:00.000Z	wols_	vampirefrog	check md5sum of the CD for bad burn/download
2008-06-23T23:50:00.000Z	vampirefrog	wols_	hm.. what if it's looking for its root filesystem in the wrong place? it's trying to access a cdrom, but it's a dvd drive... can I specify the root device?
2008-06-23T23:58:00.000Z	wols_	vampirefrog	do not tell people to install that driver
2008-06-23T23:58:00.000Z	vampirefrog	wols_	:) works fine for me
