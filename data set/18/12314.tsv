2006-05-04T15:48:00.000Z	owh		As a debian user of many years, I have a silly question. I'm contemplating installing Ubuntu on a client machine. If I do that, and a future version of Ubuntu is released, can they boot from the new CD and upgrade their workstation without supervision?
2006-05-04T15:49:00.000Z	imbrandon	owh	yes lol
2006-05-04T15:50:00.000Z	imbrandon	owh	it works the same as debain soo in that respect if you would let them unsupervised with a debain apt-get upgrade then yes
2006-05-04T15:51:00.000Z	owh	imbrandon	Does the CD do this itself, or do they need to get their hands dirty?
2006-05-04T15:51:00.000Z	imbrandon	owh	 a little dirty but not anything you cant show them in 5 seconds
2006-05-04T15:51:00.000Z	owh	imbrandon	Except that "show" involves a trip of 3000km :-)
2006-05-04T15:52:00.000Z	owh	imbrandon	Actually, that's one-way :-)
2006-05-04T15:52:00.000Z	imbrandon	owh	so if they can add the cd to sources.list on their own then it should be all gravy
2006-05-04T15:52:00.000Z	owh	imbrandon	Does the CD allow you to boot from it and detect a previous install and offer to upgrade?
2006-05-04T15:52:00.000Z	imbrandon	owh	not sure
2006-05-04T15:53:00.000Z	owh	imbrandon	Hmm, might need to play a little with VMWare before I let them loose :)
2006-05-04T15:53:00.000Z	owh	imbrandon	Thanks for your time.
2006-05-04T15:53:00.000Z	imbrandon	owh	, will they have internet ? they can upgrade via the apt-get dist-upgrade option too
2006-05-04T15:53:00.000Z	owh	imbrandon	They do have Internet.
2006-05-04T15:53:00.000Z	owh	imbrandon	Hmm.
2006-05-04T15:54:00.000Z	imbrandon	owh	 that might be the best option for them then
2006-05-04T15:54:00.000Z	owh	imbrandon	I was attracted to Ubuntu because of the regular CD release. I'll have another think about this.
2006-05-04T15:55:00.000Z	imbrandon	owh	np
