2007-05-20T09:27:00.000Z	brennus390	jfree	is job control the at daemon?
2007-05-20T09:28:00.000Z	brennus390	jfree	are you dual booting?
2007-05-20T09:29:00.000Z	jfree	brennus390	what do you mean
2007-05-20T09:29:00.000Z	brennus390	jfree	is ubuntu the only OS your running on the pc?
2007-05-20T09:30:00.000Z	jfree	brennus390	well no i have many kernels and an old xp install on there too
2007-05-20T09:31:00.000Z	brennus390	jfree	does it look like grub is finding the stage2 loader?  or is grub hangning?
2007-05-20T09:32:00.000Z	jfree	brennus390	grub is hanging
2007-05-20T09:32:00.000Z	jfree	brennus390	takes long time to do nothing
2007-05-20T09:33:00.000Z	brennus390	jfree	sounds like your grub configuration isn't pointing to the correct OS loader
2007-05-20T09:33:00.000Z	jfree	brennus390	can i fix that without installind again
2007-05-20T09:34:00.000Z	brennus390	jfree	yes...when grub starts running there is a command to interupt the loading process...this will allow you to pick your stage2 img loader...can't remember the command though
2007-05-20T09:35:00.000Z	jfree	brennus390	any fourms or links you know that will help
2007-05-20T09:35:00.000Z	brennus390	jfree	googling 'configure grub' as we speak :)
2007-05-20T09:36:00.000Z	brennus390	jfree	"http://www.linuxmigration.com/quickref/kernel/grub.html" this looks like a good start
