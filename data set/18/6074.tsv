2008-11-24T22:41:00.000Z	Pizarro	fde	 a PBX software
2008-11-24T22:42:00.000Z	Pizarro	fde	it is a software that enables a phone recepcionist in your server, giving you the possibility to have SIP phone communication, PSTN comm, etc..
2008-11-24T22:44:00.000Z	fde	Pizarro	it didn't... you didn't have 32bit libs, and that software is 32bit...
