2006-11-07T09:24:00.000Z	GerManson	sethk	i wanted gnome 2.16 :( lol
2006-11-07T09:24:00.000Z	sethk	GerManson	you can upgrade gnome without upgrading the world.
2006-11-07T09:24:00.000Z	GerManson	sethk	i know, but upgrading distro was the easiest way
2006-11-07T09:24:00.000Z	sethk	GerManson	unless it doesn't work, then it's not _quite_ so easy.  :)
2006-11-07T09:24:00.000Z	GerManson	sethk	lol, you are right.
2006-11-07T09:25:00.000Z	sethk	GerManson	then stop resisting it, and just byte the bullet.
2006-11-07T09:25:00.000Z	GerManson	sethk	tomorrow morning :)
2006-11-07T09:26:00.000Z	sethk	GerManson	that's easily fixed, though
2006-11-07T09:27:00.000Z	sethk	GerManson	just install the smp kernel
2006-11-07T09:27:00.000Z	GerManson	sethk	there is no smp kernel now, they say its "emmbed" just in one.
2006-11-07T09:27:00.000Z	sethk	GerManson	probably the same.  in any event, rebuilding the kernel is trivial
2006-11-07T09:27:00.000Z	GerManson	sethk	rebuilding was my first choice but didnt work
2006-11-07T09:28:00.000Z	sethk	GerManson	why not?  How did you try to do it?
2006-11-07T09:28:00.000Z	sethk	GerManson	that's not rebuliding.
2006-11-07T09:28:00.000Z	sethk	GerManson	you install the source, copy in the config, do make xconfig, enable smp, and build.
2006-11-07T09:29:00.000Z	sethk	GerManson	there is nothing you can do in gentoo that you can't do in ubuntu.
2006-11-07T09:29:00.000Z	GerManson	sethk	i know seth..
2006-11-07T09:29:00.000Z	GerManson	sethk	but you get used to one way after some years
