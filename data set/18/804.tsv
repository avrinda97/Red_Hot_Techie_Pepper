2012-04-14T06:59:00.000Z	les	darbe	something is trying to reference a null object in gedit. best way to see what is happening is run gedit in gdb and then do whatever it you're doing to generate that and get the backtrace.
2012-04-14T07:00:00.000Z	darbe	les	how can I run in gdb
2012-04-14T07:00:00.000Z	les	darbe	gdb grub :)
2012-04-14T07:01:00.000Z	darbe	les	it happend before
2012-04-14T07:01:00.000Z	darbe	les	Somebody gave a command , so it worked
2012-04-14T07:01:00.000Z	darbe	les	problem is it uses old library
2012-04-14T07:01:00.000Z	les	darbe	you could try running ldconfig to update the cache maybe
2012-04-14T07:02:00.000Z	darbe		two days ago it updated
2012-04-14T07:02:00.000Z	darbe	les	nptohng is happening
2012-04-14T07:03:00.000Z	darbe	les	it's done
2012-04-14T07:03:00.000Z	darbe		it doesn't still work
2012-04-14T07:05:00.000Z	les	darbe	well i don't know then. it's a generic glib error message so without more information i have no way of knowing what's going on.  if it happened two days ago and you fixed it, i suggest doing that agaiN!
2012-04-14T07:05:00.000Z	darbe	les	i don't remember command
