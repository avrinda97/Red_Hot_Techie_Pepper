2009-05-10T02:04:00.000Z	midkniht		all yur ubuntu is mine
2009-05-10T02:05:00.000Z	penguins2387	midkniht	awesome! maybe you can answer my question there
2009-05-10T02:06:00.000Z	midkniht	penguins2387	no, there is no hidden user accounts
2009-05-10T02:08:00.000Z	midkniht	penguins2387	the account you refer to is not enabled.  your line in /etc/shadow should look like this: games:*:13991:0:99999:7:::
2009-05-10T02:08:00.000Z	penguins2387	midkniht	if you try to create a user account called games it won't let you, says it's already in use, if you sudo passwd any thing else it says no such account but if you sudo passwd games it lets you set a pass word and allowed me to log in on tty1 and use the games in the directory
2009-05-10T02:08:00.000Z	midkniht	penguins2387	it isnt a hidden account, its in /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow
2009-05-10T02:08:00.000Z	penguins2387	midkniht	i enabled it to log in to tty1 to find out what it is for
2009-05-10T02:09:00.000Z	penguins2387		midknhit ah thank you, you wouldn't know what it's for would you?
2009-05-10T02:09:00.000Z	midkniht	penguins2387	its a system used account, you shouldnt use it for login
2009-05-10T02:09:00.000Z	penguins2387	midkniht	gotcha i won't
2009-05-10T02:10:00.000Z	penguins2387	midkniht	do you forsee any negative affects from setting a password for it? besides the usual security issues
2009-05-10T02:10:00.000Z	midkniht		fucking smoak instead then
2009-05-10T02:10:00.000Z	midkniht		Shockrates,
2009-05-10T02:10:00.000Z	penguins2387		say flash plugin?
2009-05-10T02:11:00.000Z	midkniht	penguins2387	its a very common login, and probably used to preserve games group ownership.  i would just put it back and create another account to mess with
2009-05-10T02:13:00.000Z	penguins2387	midkniht	awesome thank you sir, you are a gentleman and a scholar from your toenails to your collar. in any event I was just trying to set up and account so i can run a second simultanious x session with a minimalist window manager for running games
2009-05-10T02:14:00.000Z	midkniht	penguins2387	sudo adduser <username> then change your window manager in session options when you login from gdm
2009-05-10T02:15:00.000Z	penguins2387	midkniht	awesome thanks. talk to you later
