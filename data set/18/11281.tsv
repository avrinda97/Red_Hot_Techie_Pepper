2006-09-16T08:16:00.000Z	baconbacon		no you can't set a password on a file transparently
2006-09-16T08:17:00.000Z	baconbacon		it just couldn't be practical
2006-09-16T08:17:00.000Z	baconbacon		imagine an application trying to open the file... how does it handle getting the password? what if it is a background program
2006-09-16T08:18:00.000Z	baconbacon		tsk tsk tsk NOT kernel, linux-image
2006-09-16T08:19:00.000Z	baconbacon		!linux-source
2006-09-16T08:19:00.000Z	baconbacon		!linux-source > w30
2006-09-16T08:21:00.000Z	w30	baconbacon	yeah, I got that and it gave me 2.6.15.7-ubuntu1, I want the same kernel that the updater installs. 2.6.15-26
2006-09-16T08:22:00.000Z	baconbacon	w30	what? just install linux-source, youll get latest source
2006-09-16T08:23:00.000Z	baconbacon	w30	version of package linux-source is not the same as version of the kernel it installs
2006-09-16T08:25:00.000Z	baconbacon	w30	linux-source package is currently 2.6.15.24, but it installs kernel 2.6.15-26.47
2006-09-16T08:26:00.000Z	w30	baconbacon	ok
2006-09-16T08:26:00.000Z	baconbacon	w30	that's weird i know but trust it, kernel source packages are uploaded same time as kernel binary
2006-09-16T08:36:00.000Z	w30	baconbacon	ok, thanks it's confusing but I suppose if I compile the kernel then I don't want to update with the automatic installer then.
2006-09-16T08:37:00.000Z	w30	baconbacon	I would want do my own updating.
2006-09-16T08:37:00.000Z	baconbacon	w30	i say youd better use the package. Ubuntu patches are included. security pdates are fast.
2006-09-16T08:39:00.000Z	w30	baconbacon	I gotta get a /lib/modules/build directory for a 3rd party kernel module in order for it to compile.
2006-09-16T08:40:00.000Z	baconbacon	w30	see if you can get away with linux-headers-386 (or 686...). most of the time kernel modules just require that
2006-09-16T09:22:00.000Z	w30	baconbacon	thanks for the kernel tips :=)
