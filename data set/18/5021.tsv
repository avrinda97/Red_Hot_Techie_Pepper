2009-12-28T15:04:00.000Z	pavel_	wolter	I see devices, I have volume on 100% but I can hear no sound
2009-12-28T15:04:00.000Z	wolter	pavel_	are you using pulseaudio?
2009-12-28T15:05:00.000Z	wolter	pavel_	open sound preferences
2009-12-28T15:05:00.000Z	pavel_	wolter	I installed pulseaudio

2009-12-28T15:08:00.000Z	pavel_	wolter	it is up to me:)
2009-12-28T15:08:00.000Z	wolter	pavel_	did you alter any files, such as asound.conf?
2009-12-28T15:08:00.000Z	pavel_	wolter	no
2009-12-28T15:08:00.000Z	wolter	pavel_	well, do neither work?
2009-12-28T15:08:00.000Z	pavel_	wolter	none of the posibilities works
2009-12-28T15:09:00.000Z	wolter	pavel_	install [pavucontrol]
2009-12-28T15:10:00.000Z	pavel_	wolter	got them both
2009-12-28T15:11:00.000Z	wolter	pavel_	under [Devices]

2009-12-28T15:12:00.000Z	pavel_	wolter	sorry
2009-12-28T15:13:00.000Z	pavel_	wolter	sound seems to work good now
2009-12-28T15:14:00.000Z	wolter	pavel_	good... just remember what you did before it got fixed.. Maybe write it down because it may happen that the next time you log in it won't work again
