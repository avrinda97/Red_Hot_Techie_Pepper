2008-08-25T08:21:00.000Z	Joeseph		The instruction line for the smb:// printer is a bit ambiguous.  Could somone tell me what to put in for the supposed setup of  "smb://[workgrou/]server[:port]/printer"
2008-08-25T08:22:00.000Z	Joeseph		I'm not really sure what the brackets mean.  Optional? do I actually need them in brackets?
2008-08-25T08:24:00.000Z	Joeseph		sorry, I think I'm asking a pretty straightforward question. Could anyone help me out on getting my windows printer to work? I just need clarification.  google is not being very informative.
2008-08-25T08:24:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	Joeseph	Is the printer you're trying to connect to supported by Windows drivers?
2008-08-25T08:25:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	Joeseph	Does the printer you're trying to connect to have Linux drivers available?
2008-08-25T08:26:00.000Z	Joeseph	LSD|Ninja	I do not know.  I will search and see.  I just figured I would be able to at least see it.  just a minute then.....
2008-08-25T08:27:00.000Z	Joeseph	LSD|Ninja	 On linuxprinting.org, it shows my printer as working 'perfectly' with the suggested 'hpijs' driver.  Will I have to install it manually? I figured It would ask me for a driver once I found it.
2008-08-25T08:29:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	Joeseph	Check synaptic, it might be installed already. You should be able to find a guide on how to set it up somewhere, just remember to give it the UNC address of your WIndows printer as the target
2008-08-25T08:30:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	Joeseph	Oh, that's normal
2008-08-25T08:30:00.000Z	Joeseph	LSD|Ninja	So I guess I really just need to know how to decipher the line its asking me to give.  It's a bit ambiguous in my opinion.
2008-08-25T08:31:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	Joeseph	usually it's just smb://user:password@Workgroup/Share but you still need the normal local printing support set up and working first
2008-08-25T08:32:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	Joeseph	sorry, /Workgroup/Computer/Share
2008-08-25T08:33:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	Joeseph	Hang five, I'm checking what I use for my Brotehr laser
2008-08-25T08:38:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	Joeseph	I'm digging for mine right now
2008-08-25T08:39:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	Joeseph	smb:///username:password@computer/Printer f the share has a password attached
2008-08-25T08:42:00.000Z	Joeseph	LSD|Ninja	okay, new problem.  Whenever I hit the @ for the user name and password, it switches the line to "/localhost"
2008-08-25T08:46:00.000Z	Joeseph	LSD|Ninja	usser: Odd..... it said it wasn't shared on my vista pc, even though I can print on it off my vista laptop..... so I shared it, and it seems to be working a bit better now.
2008-08-25T08:48:00.000Z	LSD|Ninja	Joeseph	sounds like a permissions issue then
