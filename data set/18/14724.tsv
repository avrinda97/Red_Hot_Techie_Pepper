2005-08-02T07:42:00.000Z	gpd		If I could stop realplayer from being sooo sloow in firefox i would wake up...
2005-08-02T07:43:00.000Z	thoreauputic	gpd	sometimes it helps to delete the *sw* plugins for realplayer (don't know why)
2005-08-02T07:44:00.000Z	gpd	thoreauputic	you mean shockwave?
2005-08-02T07:45:00.000Z	thoreauputic	gpd	real has a couple of plugins with sw in them ( I guess they are supposed to do shockwave but I've never seen it work)
2005-08-02T07:48:00.000Z	gpd	thoreauputic	removed those sw plugins, seems better, thanks!
2005-08-02T07:48:00.000Z	thoreauputic	gpd	i got that tip from the BBC site , of all places ;)
2005-08-03T11:55:00.000Z	thoreauputic	gpd	it won't flood the channel with a long list - use /msg ubotu list
2005-08-03T11:57:00.000Z	gpd	thoreauputic	is ubotu supybot?
2005-08-03T11:57:00.000Z	thoreauputic	gpd	ubotu is a blootbot
2005-08-03T12:14:00.000Z	gpd	thoreauputic	that is apt-cache search libjack
2005-08-03T12:14:00.000Z	thoreauputic	gpd	yes, you're right
2005-08-03T12:14:00.000Z	gpd	thoreauputic	that is easy... but finding a specific file in the repository i have not achieved
2005-08-03T12:15:00.000Z	thoreauputic	gpd	in theory apt-file should do it if it exists... puzzling
2005-08-03T12:15:00.000Z	gpd	thoreauputic	does apt-file require the full path?
2005-08-03T12:15:00.000Z	thoreauputic	gpd	I don't think so
2005-08-03T12:16:00.000Z	gpd	thoreauputic	Randall64 I assumed it was using the apt-get database
2005-08-03T12:24:00.000Z	gpd	thoreauputic	Randall64 some interesting things emerge... alien ignores obvious dependency for libjack.so.0... ubuntu does not have said file anywhere... apt-file is useful but needs to be updated independently from apt-get... libjack0.80.0 is clearly far newer than djplay... djplay is probably not worth installing ;)
2005-08-08T08:18:00.000Z	thoreauputic	gpd	right
