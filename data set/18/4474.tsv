2009-04-06T06:42:00.000Z	the_engineer		Hello anyone out there willing to help me troubleshoot an issue I'm having?  I migrated from Ubuntu to Xubuntu for the faster speeds and Now an application that was previously set to autostart, is still automatically starting and I want it to stop. Any ideas?
2009-04-06T06:43:00.000Z	the_engineer		I Started out with Ubuntu hardy Heron if that helps anyone
2009-04-06T06:45:00.000Z	thecommutist	the_engineer	go to System>Preferences>Sessions>Startup Programs
2009-04-06T06:52:00.000Z	the_engineer	thecommutist	in the XFCE Settings manager there is an entry for "Sessions and Startup" But it does not give any application-specific listings just some check boxes for login/logoff prefs mainly
2009-04-06T06:56:00.000Z	thecommutist	the_engineer	look in ~/.config/autostart there must be an entry for that application, try deleting that and see
2009-04-06T06:57:00.000Z	the_engineer	thecommutist	it appears to be empty
2009-04-06T07:01:00.000Z	thecommutist	the_engineer	ok, how about /etc/xdg/autostart?
2009-04-06T07:04:00.000Z	thecommutist	the_engineer	any luck with /etc/xdg/autostart
2009-04-06T07:06:00.000Z	thecommutist	the_engineer	no, no don't do that! might mess up ur system!
2009-04-06T07:07:00.000Z	the_engineer	thecommutist	lol
2009-04-06T07:07:00.000Z	thecommutist	the_engineer	u could try the xubuntu forums or irc channel, i seem to have struck a dead end unfortunately!
2009-04-06T07:08:00.000Z	the_engineer	thecommutist	 thanks for your help!
2009-04-06T07:08:00.000Z	thecommutist	the_engineer	can u tell me what exactly that application does?
2009-04-06T07:09:00.000Z	the_engineer	thecommutist	the application is transmission v1.42
2009-04-06T07:09:00.000Z	the_engineer	thecommutist	i need to have it start after I assemble my raid array which is not automatcially assembling itself.  I use MDADM to manage it
2009-04-06T07:10:00.000Z	thecommutist	the_engineer	now this might sound extreme, but is it possible for u to uninstall transmission, reboot the machine and then install it again, might work
2009-04-06T07:13:00.000Z	thecommutist	the_engineer	check this (pasted from xfce wiki faq) - http://paste.ubuntu.com/145242/
2009-04-06T07:22:00.000Z	the_engineer	thecommutist	your link has some good info in it too.  I am looking into this as a possible fix as well.
