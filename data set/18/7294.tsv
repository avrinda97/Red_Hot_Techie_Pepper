2012-11-20T05:46:00.000Z	Geothst		Does anyone know how to get Unity to stop crashing?
2012-11-20T05:46:00.000Z	Geothst		Ubuntu has some dependencies on unity, so I can't.
2012-11-20T05:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Geothst	what is the output of:  lsb_release -sc
2012-11-20T05:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Geothst	you could use a different session if you don't like Unity. You can install xcfe4 and use that desktop instead of Gnome
2012-11-20T05:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Geothst	try unity2d
2012-11-20T05:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Geothst	have you tested your RAM?
2012-11-20T06:06:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Geothst	hold SHIFT at boot, select the Memtest from the Grub menu to test
2012-11-20T07:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Geothst	can you pastebin the output of:    gedit /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gnome3-team-gnome3-precise.list
2012-11-20T07:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Geothst	why are you adding the PPA anyway?
2012-11-20T07:32:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Geothst	can you pastebin the output of:    gedit /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gnome3-team-gnome3-precise.list
2012-11-20T07:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Geothst	can you please use http://pastebin.ubuntu.com   open the /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gnome3-team-gnome3-precise.list file and pastebin the file please
2012-11-20T07:34:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Geothst	ok cool
2012-11-20T07:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Geothst	if you want the PPA just run:  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:gnome3-team/gnome3
2012-11-20T07:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Geothst	then run: sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get upgrade
2012-11-20T07:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Geothst	your call, those packages are not supported here
2012-11-20T07:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Geothst	Precise comes with Gnome3 by default
2012-11-20T07:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Geothst	it just uses Unity shell, instead of the default Gnome shell which is the 'normal' shell for Gnome 3
2012-11-20T07:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	Geothst	did you upgrade from Precise to Quantal?
