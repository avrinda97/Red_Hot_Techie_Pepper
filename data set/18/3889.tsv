2009-08-02T08:38:00.000Z	welltb		hello..got a question..i installed a new wifi card to my desktop and i can't seem to get it to work.  i've tried a few things, but now it reads "device not managed"
2009-08-02T08:38:00.000Z	welltb		any takers?
2009-08-02T08:38:00.000Z	purplenurple	welltb	have you installed the drivers for it?
2009-08-02T08:41:00.000Z	welltb	purplenurple	i was able to get the "activity" light to work, now it doesn't even come on.  At boot it hangs...using Crunchbang 9.04...
2009-08-02T08:42:00.000Z	purplenurple	welltb	what hangs the OS?  Did you or did you not install the drivers?
2009-08-02T08:44:00.000Z	purplenurple	welltb	can you hit alt+F2 at the splash and see what is causing errors?
2009-08-02T08:44:00.000Z	welltb	purplenurple	 i will try...

2009-08-02T08:50:00.000Z	purplenurple	welltb	try starting w/ no security ... moving up to WEP and then moving to WPA
2009-08-02T08:51:00.000Z	purplenurple	welltb	I've found that my card doesn't like certain types of WPA
2009-08-02T08:51:00.000Z	welltb	purplenurple	 how do you do that?
2009-08-02T08:51:00.000Z	purplenurple	welltb	do you have access to your router?
2009-08-02T08:53:00.000Z	welltb	purplenurple	 yes, but,  i'll have to continue with this later.  thanks for the try though, bud...
