2008-01-09T04:27:00.000Z	kavok2		How do I close the update manager if a terminal won';t come up
2008-01-09T04:27:00.000Z	soundray	kavok2	do you get a Run dialog with Alt-F2?
2008-01-09T04:27:00.000Z	kavok2	soundray	no
2008-01-09T04:28:00.000Z	soundray	kavok2	I'd follow KlrSpz's suggestion then and try a Ctrl-Alt-Backspace
2008-01-09T04:28:00.000Z	kavok2	soundray	& klrspz: ctrl alt bckspace does nothing :(
2008-01-09T04:29:00.000Z	soundray	kavok2	I suspect your keyboard is frozen then. Add the Force-Quit applet to the panel and use that to terminate the update manager
2008-01-09T04:30:00.000Z	kavok2	soundray	that might be it, my  caps lock key won't light up anything
2008-01-09T04:30:00.000Z	kavok2	soundray	how do I do that
2008-01-09T04:31:00.000Z	soundray	kavok2	right-click the panel, select Add to Panel, find the ForceQuit applet in the list and add it
2008-01-09T04:32:00.000Z	soundray	kavok2	or listen to thann0y
2008-01-09T04:32:00.000Z	kavok2	soundray	that didnt work either lol
2008-01-09T04:32:00.000Z	kavok2	soundray	the force quit did
2008-01-09T04:32:00.000Z	kavok2	soundray	but not the printscreen thing
2008-01-09T04:33:00.000Z	soundray	kavok2	you may have to hold Ctrl and Alt and PrtScrn (SysRq), then hit R
2008-01-09T04:34:00.000Z	kavok2	soundray	it looks like im going to have to forcefully restart the computer
2008-01-09T04:34:00.000Z	soundray	kavok2	try a "soft" shutdown using the Quit icon first
2008-01-09T04:34:00.000Z	kavok2	soundray	the quit icon wont activate
2008-01-09T04:35:00.000Z	soundray	kavok2	okay, if you have to cut the power, there's always a small risk of data loss (very small actually, thanks to ext3), but if you have exhausted all other options, go ahead.
