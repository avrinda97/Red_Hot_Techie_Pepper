2007-04-13T16:55:00.000Z	NemesisD		I'm not sure if you guys are familiar with ddrescue but I have kind of a general question, is it possible to install packages and use packages while running ubuntu from LiveCD?
2007-04-13T16:56:00.000Z	hamlet	NemesisD	yes
2007-04-13T16:56:00.000Z	NemesisD	hamlet	is there some special way to do it? the person in question has the .deb file and ran it and it said installed, but the command that should be there, dd_rescue was not found
2007-04-13T16:57:00.000Z	NemesisD		i'm trying to help him on the phone and I have an installed version of ubuntu and the man page came up for that command just fine
2007-04-13T16:57:00.000Z	hamlet	NemesisD	nothing special. just everything is in RAM
2007-04-13T16:57:00.000Z	NemesisD		so do you have any idea why this wouldn't be working for him?
2007-04-13T16:58:00.000Z	hamlet	NemesisD	can he verify the install in some way? look at the list of files which should be installed and see if they really are?
2007-04-13T16:59:00.000Z	NemesisD		ah i'm at a loss for the terminal command for that
2007-04-13T16:59:00.000Z	hamlet	NemesisD	i don't understand you
2007-04-13T05:00:00.000Z	NemesisD	hamlet	would it be something like dpkg -l | grep ddrescue
2007-04-13T05:00:00.000Z	hamlet	NemesisD	dpkg -L ddrescue
2007-04-13T05:00:00.000Z	NemesisD		ok and it should list a bunch of directories right?
2007-04-13T05:00:00.000Z	hamlet	NemesisD	yes
2007-04-13T05:00:00.000Z	NemesisD		ok ill have him try it, and what if that fails?
2007-04-13T05:01:00.000Z	hamlet	NemesisD	he could see how the binary should be named and if it is installed
2007-04-13T05:01:00.000Z	NemesisD		alright ill call him back
2007-04-13T05:01:00.000Z	hamlet	NemesisD	i would take a special resque live cd. there is a bunch of them
