2008-10-07T18:45:00.000Z	paolo_		Hi guys! I'm trying to mount an external usb disk, lsusb sees it, but fdisk not. Do I lack any package installed? thank you!
2008-10-07T18:45:00.000Z	IcyPolecat	paolo_	what's the reponse to #mount /dev/???
2008-10-07T18:47:00.000Z	IcyPolecat	paolo_	also can you pastebin the relvent lines from lusb?
2008-10-07T18:47:00.000Z	paolo_	IcyPolecat	i can't issue e #mount /dev/??? because the disk isn't seen as a disk. sudo fdisk -l doesn't see it, ls /dev/disk/by-path doesn't see it
2008-10-07T18:47:00.000Z	paolo_	IcyPolecat	what lines?
2008-10-07T18:48:00.000Z	IcyPolecat	paolo_	so what shows up in lusb? and what does dmesg print when you've plugged it in?
2008-10-07T18:49:00.000Z	paolo_	IcyPolecat	lsusb tells: "Bus 002 Device 003: ID 04b4:6830 Cypress Semiconductor Corp. USB-2.0 IDE Adapter"
2008-10-07T18:52:00.000Z	IcyPolecat	paolo_	and does anything show up when you run #dmesg?
2008-10-07T18:53:00.000Z	paolo_	IcyPolecat	http://paste.ubuntu.com/55001/ is what dmesg shows
2008-10-07T18:56:00.000Z	IcyPolecat	paolo_	do other dirves work ok? and do you get anything further in dmesg after a while (i.e. a couple of minutes)?
2008-10-07T18:56:00.000Z	IcyPolecat	paolo_	*drives
2008-10-07T18:57:00.000Z	paolo_	IcyPolecat	el disco principal (/dev/sda) funciona perfectamente
2008-10-07T18:59:00.000Z	IcyPolecat	paolo_	understood but that's not going through the USB controller is it... at the moment it looks like an issue with the module responsible for high speed usb2.0 functionality.
2008-10-07T19:04:00.000Z	paolo_	IcyPolecat	a kernel module? what?
2008-10-07T19:06:00.000Z	IcyPolecat	paolo_	sorry - the bit of ubuntu that handles USB drives isn't working properly. You could try removing the uhci_hcd module and seeing if that makes a difference. You can always reenable it later
2008-10-07T19:07:00.000Z	paolo_	IcyPolecat	ok, thank you
2008-10-07T19:07:00.000Z	IcyPolecat	paolo_	to remove run the following in a terminal: sudo modprobe -r ehic_hcd
2008-10-07T19:08:00.000Z	IcyPolecat	paolo_	and then reboot your machine. to re enable simply run sudo modprobe ehic_hcd and then reboot
