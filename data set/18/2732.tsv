2010-03-05T08:31:00.000Z	Parogar		could that be why?
2010-03-05T08:33:00.000Z	Parogar		I'll try doing it differently next time then
2010-03-05T08:34:00.000Z	Parogar		on a slightly different note, another problem I am having with Ubuntu, is that when I try and compile using g++ programs I have written in windows. I get tons of parsing errors
2010-03-05T08:34:00.000Z	Parogar		someone said it has to do with end line characters from windows to ubuntu?
2010-03-05T08:35:00.000Z	Parogar		kk thanks will do that this time
2010-03-05T08:35:00.000Z	Parogar		yes
2010-03-05T08:36:00.000Z	Parogar		gcc Main.cpp List.cpp -o LinkedList
2010-03-05T08:36:00.000Z	Parogar		that's the syntax I am using
2010-03-05T08:36:00.000Z	Parogar		hundreds of erros
2010-03-05T08:36:00.000Z	Parogar		errors*
2010-03-05T08:37:00.000Z	trism	Parogar	you can fix the line ending problem with dos2unix in the tofrodos package (windows defaults to \r\n at the end of lines, linux uses just a \n)
2010-03-05T08:37:00.000Z	Parogar		ahh.
2010-03-05T08:37:00.000Z	Parogar		and I just run my files through this?
2010-03-05T08:38:00.000Z	trism	Parogar	yes
2010-03-05T08:39:00.000Z	Parogar		sorry for all the noob questions, I am brand new to linux.
2010-03-05T08:42:00.000Z	Parogar	trism	Your suggestion worked thanks. it compiled into something called a.out?
2010-03-05T08:43:00.000Z	Parogar		Is it possible to name it LinkedList.exe or .out or whatever linux uses
2010-03-05T08:43:00.000Z	trism	Parogar	you can specify the executable name with -o, linux doesn't require a certain extention for executables, just that their permissions are set correctly (+x)
