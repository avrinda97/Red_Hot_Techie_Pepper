2006-03-26T12:21:00.000Z	jbritz22		im pretty sure i enabled them all
2006-03-26T12:21:00.000Z	jbritz22		all i got is kde, and kdebase-doc
2006-03-26T12:21:00.000Z	tritium	jbritz22	you should install kubuntu-desktop
2006-03-26T12:22:00.000Z	tritium	jbritz22	all you want is konsole?  odd...
2006-03-26T12:23:00.000Z	tritium	jbritz22	if you do that, might as well get kubuntu-desktop, then
2006-03-26T12:25:00.000Z	tritium	jbritz22	sudo apt-get update first
2006-03-26T12:26:00.000Z	tritium	jbritz22	it's in main, so you should find it, unless your /etc/apt/sources.list is only setup for your cdrom
2006-03-26T12:27:00.000Z	tritium	jbritz22	look at your /etc/apt/sources.list
2006-03-26T12:29:00.000Z	tritium	jbritz22	that's it?  no...
2006-03-26T13:16:00.000Z	tritium	jbritz22	watch your language, please
