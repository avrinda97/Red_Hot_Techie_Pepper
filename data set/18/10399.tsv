It's hard to find a middle ground, so people give "advice" to make askers feel like they've not been shafted, but at the same time not very useful advice because they don't know much about it.
2006-12-16T12:38:00.000Z	arrenlex	sonicGB	For example, I don't use Gnome or synaptic, so when people ask how to, for example, configure the sound or add repositories, the only way in which I could help them would be to give them command line instructions, which are confusing and unnecessary since there's a GUI way to do it. So I stay quiet a lot of times because I don't want my help to hurt them. I imagine a lot of people have come up with weird ways to do what they want 
2006-12-16T12:39:00.000Z	sonicGB	arrenlex	I know what you're saying. I just you just have to work on that sixth sense, figureing out what advice is right for what people, and sticking to answering the ones you can!
2006-12-16T12:41:00.000Z	arrenlex	sonicGB	I had that network card, and I resorted to unscrewing my old box and stealing one of the NICs from there just so I could have internet. What kind of advice is that? xD
2006-12-16T13:00:00.000Z	arrenlex	sonicGB	You got a little wordy and were cut off at "ANY postscript printer".
2006-12-16T13:02:00.000Z	sonicGB	arrenlex	in this case he got the printer before he got linux!
2006-12-16T13:03:00.000Z	arrenlex	sonicGB	I'm aware of that. We were in the hypothetical situation of "how to avoid the printing problem" and I pitched in for future reference.
2006-12-16T13:06:00.000Z	sonicGB	arrenlex	re future info... no worries... I wasn't having a go at you :-)
2006-12-16T13:07:00.000Z	sonicGB	arrenlex	"cat /dev/random | mplayer" ?? :-) :-) :-)
2006-12-16T13:12:00.000Z	arrenlex	sonicGB	Isn't there some graphical utility to configure printing? KDE has kprinter so I've never even had to touch cups itself after apt-get install cupsys... everything was handled by a fantastic GUI.
2006-12-16T13:13:00.000Z	sonicGB	arrenlex	ah, yes... emun, I should add that I'm absolutely no expert on anything GUI-related on linux/unix... I use them as servers, I do it all on command line...
2006-12-16T13:13:00.000Z	sonicGB	arrenlex	actually, once installed, CUPS is all web based.
2006-12-16T13:59:00.000Z	sonicGB	arrenlex	I have the gamma thing on a default kubunto 6.10 install here...
2006-12-16T14:09:00.000Z	sonicGB	arrenlex	but KDE confuses the users! <grin> :-)
2006-12-16T14:09:00.000Z	arrenlex	sonicGB	No it doesn't, because you can use it without touching a single option. But if you want to mess with it you can.
2006-12-16T14:10:00.000Z	sonicGB	arrenlex	I shall in future raise my hand in the air when I'm being facetious :-) :-)
2006-12-16T14:10:00.000Z	arrenlex	sonicGB	...oh. xD
