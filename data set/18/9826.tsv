2012-11-29T11:07:00.000Z	ericab		how can i remove ALL text AFTER the FIRST occurance of a 4 digit number in a string of text ?
2012-11-29T11:08:00.000Z	ericab		LOL
2012-11-29T11:09:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ericab	 may be easier to just print the text from the start of the line to the end of the number. ;)
2012-11-29T11:09:00.000Z	ericab	Dr_Willis	i dont follow you
2012-11-29T11:10:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	ericab	 you wan to delete from 1344 to the end of line.. that would leave  tne <stert of the line> to the 1234
2012-11-29T11:11:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		or is the #### on one looooong line? can there be m ore then one #### per line?
2012-11-29T11:11:00.000Z	ericab		no.. for example:
2012-11-29T11:12:00.000Z	ericab		name.of.the.part.1843.location.of.part.here
2012-11-29T11:12:00.000Z	ericab		want to remove ".location.of.part.here"
2012-11-29T11:12:00.000Z	ericab		but the issue is there are thusands oand thousands of these lines
2012-11-29T11:12:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		for each line in a file?
2012-11-29T11:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		sed should be able to do it
2012-11-29T11:13:00.000Z	ericab		and the name and location all differ, so the length varies
2012-11-29T11:13:00.000Z	ericab		and each one is on a new line, yes
2012-11-29T11:13:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		first google hit for 'sed delete after pattern'
2012-11-29T11:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		https://www.google.com/url?q=http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php%3Ft%3D1897438&sa=U&ei=C_22UMDsJIu89gS2-IDQAg&ved=0CB0QFjAA&sig2=GiZbbzgwWi1_WXHkrBUC7w&usg=AFQjCNH_ZtP--J8tJDoObTbNwlZYSwbj-A
2012-11-29T11:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		oops. miss pasted
2012-11-29T11:14:00.000Z	ericab	Dr_Willis	yes ive done that; problem is the "1843" for example always varies
