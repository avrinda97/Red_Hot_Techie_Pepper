2010-12-30T04:57:00.000Z	jose__	trojan	I have two distros installed on a USB stick, but only one boots
2010-12-30T04:58:00.000Z	trojan	jose__	what distros? are u booted into 1 now?
2010-12-30T04:59:00.000Z	jose__	trojan	so I checked the grub.cfg file and I found a line I don't understand. Do you know what "search --no-floppy --fs-uuid --set [UUID]" actually does?
2010-12-30T04:59:00.000Z	jose__	trojan	yes, I'm booted into one. I have Ubuntu and Backtrack
2010-12-30T04:59:00.000Z	trojan	jose__	terminal 'sudo update grub' ,, whats in that?

2010-12-30T05:01:00.000Z	jose__	trojan	okay, but I'm not sure because one of the partitions is encrypted. I don't think that'll pick it up or will it?
2010-12-30T05:03:00.000Z	trojan	jose__	possibly not.. run 'sudo apt-get install grub2' ..
2010-12-30T05:03:00.000Z	jose__	trojan	what will that do exactly?
2010-12-30T05:04:00.000Z	jose__	trojan	backtrack comes with grub 0.97, so when I installed Ubuntu and ran update manager it upgraded version
