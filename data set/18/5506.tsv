2009-07-28T10:28:00.000Z	stryker		but when he turns on the laptop nothing comes up on the screen, so i am not even sure it will boot off the CD
2009-07-28T10:28:00.000Z	losher	stryker	I suppose the driver could have corrupted the bios, but that's very surprising...
2009-07-28T10:29:00.000Z	stryker	losher	hmm
2009-07-28T10:30:00.000Z	losher	stryker	and quite rare. I wonder if he's had a hardware failure that just happened to coincide with what you did. LCDs do lose their backlights you know...
2009-07-28T10:31:00.000Z	stryker	losher	im not sure
2009-07-28T10:31:00.000Z	losher	stryker	well, restarting does stress the hardware. If he power-cycled it, that's when most electronics dies...
2009-07-28T10:34:00.000Z	losher	stryker	first thing to try is to power off, wait a minute, then power on again and see if it comes back...
2009-07-28T10:34:00.000Z	stryker	losher	i asked and he said he did that a couple of times
2009-07-28T10:35:00.000Z	losher	stryker	black screen (backlight failure) is one of the commonest failure modes for laptops...
2009-07-28T10:47:00.000Z	losher	stryker	I don't understand. How can he tell his HD isn't responding if his monitor doesn't work?
2009-07-28T10:48:00.000Z	stryker	losher	idk
2009-07-28T10:51:00.000Z	losher	stryker	maybe you need to get him some local help. He sounds confused...
2009-07-28T10:53:00.000Z	stryker	losher	nanotube: mechtech: he's telling me that nothing happens when he turns it on, nothing at all
2009-07-28T10:54:00.000Z	losher	stryker	and check the power supply etc...
2009-07-28T11:04:00.000Z	losher	stryker	he's probably really stressed right now. Try again tomorrow...
2009-07-28T11:04:00.000Z	stryker	losher	yeah, he is, he's gonna leave it like that for tomorrow and just give it another try
2009-07-28T11:05:00.000Z	losher	stryker	been there...
2009-07-28T11:05:00.000Z	stryker	losher	yeah...
