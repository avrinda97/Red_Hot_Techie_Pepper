2006-05-11T16:09:00.000Z	serp		stop hilighting me ;(
2006-05-11T05:25:00.000Z	serp		I use Windows. What are the advantages of migrating to Ubuntu?
2006-05-11T05:27:00.000Z	serp		why is it great if I program?
2006-05-11T05:29:00.000Z	serp		I just wanna use my os to run things, I don't wanna fiddle around with it.
2006-05-11T05:29:00.000Z	serp		maybe linux is not for me then?
2006-05-11T05:29:00.000Z	tritium	serp	ubuntu doesn't require much fiddling
2006-05-11T05:32:00.000Z	tritium	serp	if you _really_ want to fiddle, I suggest doing it on the roof
2006-05-11T05:34:00.000Z	tritium	serp	thought you went off to fiddle ;)
2006-05-11T05:34:00.000Z	serp	tritium	=)

2006-05-11T05:54:00.000Z	tritium	serp	anjuta, kdevelop, eclipse
2006-05-11T05:55:00.000Z	tritium	serp	development tools and libs aren't intsalled by default
2006-05-11T05:56:00.000Z	tritium	serp	you'll want build-essential to start with, plus whatever libs, etc. you want
2006-05-11T05:57:00.000Z	tritium	serp	the average user doesn't need it
2006-05-19T14:31:00.000Z	tritium	serp	sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales
2006-05-19T14:32:00.000Z	serp	tritium	that doesn't give me any options
2006-05-19T14:33:00.000Z	tritium	serp	see if you have that.  It may only be in dapper (can't recall if it's in breezy)
2006-05-19T14:35:00.000Z	tritium	serp	this is not the channel for dapper (#ubuntu+1 is)
