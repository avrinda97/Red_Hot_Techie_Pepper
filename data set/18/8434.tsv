2008-08-29T01:40:00.000Z	Gowrav		So even after that can i run UBUNTU like ms office in XP bofh80  ??
2008-08-29T01:41:00.000Z	ZeroA4	Gowrav	kernel killed on virtualbox ? have you tested you media/iso ?
2008-08-29T01:42:00.000Z	Gowrav		wubi just installed the complete system with the same iso
2008-08-29T01:42:00.000Z	Gowrav	ZeroA4	wubi just installed the complete system with the same iso
2008-08-29T01:42:00.000Z	ZeroA4	Gowrav	but wubi uses diferent files!
2008-08-29T01:43:00.000Z	Gowrav	ZeroA4	then how to correct iso by md5 checksum .. toren do that .. but i forgot how !!
2008-08-29T01:43:00.000Z	ZeroA4	Gowrav	md5sum does NOT correnct anything... it just check if it is ok... if is not... you have to download again
2008-08-29T01:44:00.000Z	Gowrav	ZeroA4	I have done this before .. corrected my last ubuntu CD by this method.. just lost it
2008-08-29T01:45:00.000Z	ZeroA4	Gowrav	a think you are mistaken... md5sum does not correct a bad download
2008-08-29T01:45:00.000Z	Gowrav	ZeroA4	it checks where it is bad and bit torrent re download th part to correct the whole
2008-08-29T01:46:00.000Z	ZeroA4	Gowrav	bitttorrent does it internally... no need for md5sum
2008-08-29T01:46:00.000Z	ZeroA4	Gowrav	md5sum just checks... does not correct anything
2008-08-29T01:46:00.000Z	Gowrav		then bittorent shows iso is OK
2008-08-29T01:47:00.000Z	ZeroA4	Gowrav	them it should boot ok in virtualbox
2008-08-29T01:47:00.000Z	Gowrav	ZeroA4	trying again
2008-08-29T01:48:00.000Z	ZeroA4	Gowrav	where did you get ubuntu .torrent from ?
2008-08-29T01:48:00.000Z	Gowrav		ubuntu.com
2008-08-29T01:48:00.000Z	ZeroA4	Gowrav	ok
