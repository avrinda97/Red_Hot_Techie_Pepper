2006-06-27T15:06:00.000Z	darkowl		do any of you have ati x800xt card and it works with your ubuntu ?
2006-06-27T15:06:00.000Z	darkowl		because I cant get it to work
2006-06-27T15:07:00.000Z	SVisor	darkowl	both x700 and x800 cards are in trouble on Ubuntu. No to me known work arounds, unless ATI have released a proprietary driver for em.
2006-06-27T15:08:00.000Z	darkowl	SVisor	what can I do ? Can I ask ATI support about this problem ?
2006-06-27T15:09:00.000Z	SVisor	darkowl	Do not know how well ATI response on Linux questions, but you could try that, or ...
2006-06-27T15:10:00.000Z	darkowl	SVisor	well... They should answer or Ill tell them that ill charge them because on the box of my card it doesnt say that it doesnt support linux :)
2006-06-27T15:11:00.000Z	SVisor	darkowl	Try to install (using the web URL as docs) the prop. drivers. Worked great for my 9700 card
2006-06-27T15:11:00.000Z	darkowl	SVisor	i installed ati drivers using easyubuntu
2006-06-27T15:12:00.000Z	SVisor	darkowl	And still no working X?
2006-06-27T15:13:00.000Z	SVisor	darkowl	Havent used those scripts so I do not know anything about em.
2006-06-27T15:14:00.000Z	SVisor	darkowl	What happens when you start X?
2006-06-27T15:15:00.000Z	SVisor	darkowl	Well that kind of an answer does not help me anything. What kind of error? "No screen found"?
2006-06-27T15:15:00.000Z	SVisor	darkowl	What does: fgrep "(EE)" /var/log/Xorg.0.log
2006-06-27T15:16:00.000Z	SVisor	darkowl	Wht does that CLI command tell you.
