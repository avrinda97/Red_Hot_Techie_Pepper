2006-01-25T07:05:00.000Z	gnomefreak	aubs_	did you check the md5sum of the iso?
2006-01-25T07:06:00.000Z	aubs_	gnomefreak	how would i do that?
2006-01-25T07:06:00.000Z	gnomefreak	aubs_	what operating system are you using?
2006-01-25T07:07:00.000Z	gnomefreak	aubs_	you have to find a tool to download i havent uised xp tfor that in long time
2006-01-25T07:14:00.000Z	aubs_	gnomefreak	i checked the md5sum and its ok
2006-01-25T07:15:00.000Z	gnomefreak	aubs_	what speed did you burn the iso at?
2006-01-25T07:15:00.000Z	gnomefreak	aubs_	reburn it at 2x if you can lowest the better
2006-01-25T07:15:00.000Z	gnomefreak	aubs_	slow as you can
2006-01-25T07:27:00.000Z	gnomefreak	aubs_	work better?
2006-01-25T07:28:00.000Z	gnomefreak	aubs_	i dont use nero :( check the settings for iso image make sure everything is good the only other issue i can thin of is md5 is bad or bad cd :(
2006-01-25T07:29:00.000Z	gnomefreak	aubs_	thats what i would think too
2006-01-25T07:29:00.000Z	gnomefreak	aubs_	but seeing as there is only a few things involved in burning
2006-01-25T07:29:00.000Z	gnomefreak	aubs_	 it very well could be hardware
