2007-05-14T06:01:00.000Z	fred__		Hello. Is there any way to download feisty herd3?
2007-05-14T06:02:00.000Z	rysiek|pl	fred__	why on earth would you need that?
2007-05-14T06:02:00.000Z	rysiek|pl	fred__	feisty is stable now
2007-05-14T06:03:00.000Z	fred__	rysiek|pl	: because of that bug, which blocks me https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/casper/+bug/84591
2007-05-14T06:05:00.000Z	rysiek|pl	fred__	you can always mount the disks by hand
2007-05-14T06:05:00.000Z	fred__	rysiek|pl	ah? you think this should work?
2007-05-14T06:06:00.000Z	fred__	rysiek|pl	booting a second computer to test. how would you mount it?
2007-05-14T06:09:00.000Z	rysiek|pl	fred__	hmmm... you would have to know your drive's device names
2007-05-14T06:09:00.000Z	fred__	rysiek|pl	ok, i have it
2007-05-14T06:09:00.000Z	rysiek|pl	fred__	ls -l /dev | grep [hs] d[a-d]  will print you all drive's on the box
2007-05-14T06:10:00.000Z	rysiek|pl	fred__	then - simply make a dir for each of them - like mkdir /media/hda1
2007-05-14T06:10:00.000Z	rysiek|pl	fred__	sorry, that's sudo mkdir /media/hda1
2007-05-14T06:10:00.000Z	rysiek|pl	fred__	and then - sudo mount /dev/devicename /mount/dirname
2007-05-14T06:10:00.000Z	fred__	rysiek|pl	i know how to mount a volume, but i need casper to use the persistence volume correctly. it must not be visible to the system.
2007-05-14T06:11:00.000Z	rysiek|pl	fred__	ah, in that case, I have no idea :/
2007-05-14T06:12:00.000Z	fred__	rysiek|pl	bah, do not worry, i woll succeed one day, let it be through an update to feisty or a downgrade, if i ever find a downloadable herd3
2007-05-14T06:12:00.000Z	rysiek|pl	fred__	good luck :)
2007-05-14T06:13:00.000Z	fred__	rysiek|pl	heh, thanks, i will need much of it..
