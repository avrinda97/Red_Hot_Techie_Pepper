2007-04-25T06:04:00.000Z	a|K|a		So I have a Dell with brodcom wireless card and I upgraded to Fiesty Fawn (Like I had a feeling I shouldn't) and now my wireless is screwed all to hell.  Any advice?
2007-04-25T06:06:00.000Z	a|K|a		man Brodcom is really f'ing me on this whole wireless deal.  I have spent so much wasted time on it
2007-04-25T06:06:00.000Z	a|K|a		I will someday kill them
2007-04-25T06:07:00.000Z	orbin	a|K|a	card model?

2007-04-25T06:10:00.000Z	orbin	a|K|a	i think there may be a couple of threads on bcm4318 in the forum.  had a look at those?  or have you attempted ndiswrapper?  how far have you gotten?
2007-04-25T06:10:00.000Z	a|K|a	orbin	I had ndiswrapper working perfectly with Edgy Eft
2007-04-25T06:11:00.000Z	orbin	a|K|a	possibly this: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ndiswrapper/+bug/85468
2007-04-25T06:11:00.000Z	orbin	a|K|a	are you using ndiswrapper from the repos?
2007-04-25T06:12:00.000Z	a|K|a	orbin	thanks I will give it a try
2007-04-25T06:12:00.000Z	orbin	a|K|a	yes to which question?
2007-04-25T06:15:00.000Z	orbin	a|K|a	it's a bug report.  only relevant if you are using the ndiswrapper from the repos b/c it could be the cause of the problems for your card
2007-04-25T06:15:00.000Z	orbin	a|K|a	if you compiled ndiswrapper yourself on the other hand...
2007-04-25T06:17:00.000Z	a|K|a	orbin	that seems to have worked
2007-04-25T06:17:00.000Z	orbin	a|K|a	what worked?
2007-04-25T06:18:00.000Z	orbin	a|K|a	iwconfig
