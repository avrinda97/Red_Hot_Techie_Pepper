2009-05-11T03:43:00.000Z	meoblast001		hi.. i installed some libraries in order to compile a program from source... but i don't remember the names of the libraries and i don't need them anymore.... is there a way to automatically remove them?
2009-05-11T03:44:00.000Z	Amaranth	meoblast001	deborphan/debfoster but you have to be careful what you remove
2009-05-11T03:45:00.000Z	meoblast001	Amaranth	how does that fidn the packages?
2009-05-11T03:45:00.000Z	Amaranth	meoblast001	they go through every package on your system and ask you if you want to keep it
2009-05-11T03:45:00.000Z	Amaranth	meoblast001	but if you keep ubuntu-desktop all dependencies of ubuntu-desktop will be marked as kept automatically so it isn't as bad as it sounds
2009-05-11T03:45:00.000Z	meoblast001	Amaranth	how will that help me? i don't know which libraries i need still and which ones i don't
2009-05-11T03:46:00.000Z	Amaranth	meoblast001	and so on with other packages, keeping banshee will keep the mono stack, etc
2009-05-11T03:46:00.000Z	Amaranth	meoblast001	You end up having to decide on about 100 packages
2009-05-11T03:47:00.000Z	meoblast001	Amaranth	i'm confused though.. if i don't know what packages i chose to install nor which packages the machine needed, how will i decide?
2009-05-11T03:47:00.000Z	Amaranth	meoblast001	It'll keep the ones you need
2009-05-11T03:47:00.000Z	meoblast001	Amaranth	ooh
2009-05-11T03:47:00.000Z	Amaranth	meoblast001	If you say you want to keep ubuntu-desktop installed it'll know not to ask about anything that depends on
2009-05-11T03:48:00.000Z	Amaranth	meoblast001	If you say you want to keep banshee it'll keep everything it depends on, etc
2009-05-11T03:48:00.000Z	meoblast001	Amaranth	i just feel like when it comes upgrade time, i end up upgrading so many packages via the Internet because i don't uninstall enough things i don't need
2009-05-11T03:48:00.000Z	Amaranth	meoblast001	you mostly have to tell it what apps you want
2009-05-11T03:48:00.000Z	Amaranth	meoblast001	I run these tools at the end of every development cycle to clean up
2009-05-11T03:49:00.000Z	Amaranth	meoblast001	best part: it remembers your choices for next time
2009-05-11T03:49:00.000Z	Amaranth	meoblast001	tell it you want to keep ubuntu-desktop and next time you run it it won't even ask you
