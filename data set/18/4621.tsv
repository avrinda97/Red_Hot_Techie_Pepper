2010-05-01T03:45:00.000Z	tyler__	acicula	I was the guy asking about help about his graphics problems earlier.
2010-05-01T03:46:00.000Z	tyler__	acicula	I changed the value for the modeset parameter to 1.
2010-05-01T03:46:00.000Z	acicula	tyler__	the i915 flash 1==0 guy?
2010-05-01T03:46:00.000Z	tyler__	acicula	Yeah.
2010-05-01T03:46:00.000Z	tyler__	acicula	It worked... sorta.
2010-05-01T03:47:00.000Z	tyler__	acicula	I was able to get to the desktop, but I had a very low resolution (640x480).
2010-05-01T03:47:00.000Z	tyler__	acicula	There was some error box ( I couldn't read the error) and it wouldn't let me bring up a terminal.
2010-05-01T03:47:00.000Z	tyler__	acicula	Advice?
2010-05-01T03:48:00.000Z	acicula	tyler__	, try setting the vesa driver, or if you were using that already(thought you did add that at kernel) try disabeling it
2010-05-01T03:48:00.000Z	acicula	tyler__	are you running vesa now?
2010-05-01T03:48:00.000Z	tyler__	acicula	I'll try disabling it to see what happens.
2010-05-01T04:30:00.000Z	tyler__	acicula	I'm back. I've been messing with parameters and been getting no where.
2010-05-01T04:33:00.000Z	acicula	tyler__	still the same low resolution?
2010-05-01T04:35:00.000Z	tyler__	acicula	Actually, when I edited the parameters from a generated vesa menu that unetbootin creates it caused some errors. When I re-made the live flash stick and re-applied the parameter the parameter strangely, didn't work anymore.
2010-05-01T04:35:00.000Z	tyler__	acicula	I'm going to burn a CD because I think the unetbootin is causing problems.
2010-05-01T04:37:00.000Z	acicula	tyler__	dunno if that will help much re the graphics issue
2010-05-01T04:49:00.000Z	tyler__	acicula	I've been applying the boot parameters to syslinux.cfg but I think that Unetbootin is interfering with that somehow. I'm going to see if I can get to that boot option menu from the CD.
