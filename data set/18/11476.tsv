2009-11-23T04:20:00.000Z	gluxon		Hi, I was over at a friends house, trying to install ubuntu on their computer, however I kept getting Error #5 :(
2009-11-23T04:21:00.000Z	gluxon		Can anybody explain what was the problem?
2009-11-23T04:22:00.000Z	gluxon		Installing, copying files.
2009-11-23T04:22:00.000Z	gluxon		at about 32%
2009-11-23T04:23:00.000Z	gluxon		Using ubuntu 8.10.
2009-11-23T04:23:00.000Z	gluxon		I know I should have used 9.10
2009-11-23T04:23:00.000Z	gluxon		but I didn't have that in range.
2009-11-23T04:23:00.000Z	gluxon		And figured I'd just update once it's installed.
2009-11-23T04:24:00.000Z	gluxon		Yeah.
2009-11-23T04:24:00.000Z	gluxon		I'm out of CD's :(
2009-11-23T04:24:00.000Z	sebsebseb	gluxon	that's ok run 8.10 for now
2009-11-23T04:23:00.000Z	sebsebseb	gluxon	8.10 is fine for now
2009-11-23T04:23:00.000Z	sebsebseb	gluxon	it runs out of support in April I think though when 10.04 comes out
2009-11-23T04:24:00.000Z	sebsebseb	gluxon	9.04 is a good release
2009-11-23T04:24:00.000Z	sebsebseb	gluxon	buy some new CD's?  and  do a nice clean install when 10.04 comes out?
2009-11-23T04:25:00.000Z	sebsebseb	gluxon	overall 8.10 has been my favourite release since 8.04
2009-11-23T04:25:00.000Z	sebsebseb	gluxon	of course I don't run it now though
2009-11-23T04:27:00.000Z	sebsebseb	gluxon	errors such as?
