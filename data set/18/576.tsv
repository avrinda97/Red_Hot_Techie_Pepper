2012-05-18T17:52:00.000Z	Axeman		in windows i can go to IIS and see what the site name is and all that fun stuff... how can i get apache to do the same
2012-05-18T17:53:00.000Z	yeehaw	Axeman	cat /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/website.nl-vhost.conf
2012-05-18T17:56:00.000Z	Axeman	yeehaw	cat: /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/website.nl-vhost.conf no such file or directory
2012-05-18T17:57:00.000Z	yeehaw	Axeman	Substitue website.nl-vhost.conf for the actual website
2012-05-18T17:58:00.000Z	yeehaw	Axeman	Or use tab completion
2012-05-18T17:58:00.000Z	Axeman	yeehaw	same thing. i'll try tabbing over
2012-05-18T18:03:00.000Z	yeehaw	Axeman	What's in it?
2012-05-18T18:03:00.000Z	yeehaw	Axeman	Did you create any websites, next to the default one?
2012-05-18T18:05:00.000Z	Axeman	yeehaw	looks like a lot of config stuff, nothing about ZM...
2012-05-18T18:07:00.000Z	yeehaw	Axeman	Aah your using a different program. Does it even use Apache?
