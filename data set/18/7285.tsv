2011-01-27T17:37:00.000Z	hid3		Hello everyone. I am writing a script (not on ubuntu machine). Any ideas how can I get the current release's codename and numeric version? (I guess from a webpage or mirrors?)
2011-01-27T17:38:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hid3	read: man lsb_release
2011-01-27T17:39:00.000Z	hid3	ActionParsnip	I do NOT want to get my distro's version. I want to get what is exact release now, at this moment
2011-01-27T17:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hid3	define "release" please
2011-01-27T17:40:00.000Z	hid3	ActionParsnip	maverick, 10.10.
2011-01-27T17:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hid3	lsb_release -c
2011-01-27T17:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hid3	like I said, read the man page
2011-01-27T17:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hid3	it will work on ANY standard Linux
2011-01-27T17:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hid3	i'd ask in a solaris room then
2011-01-27T17:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hid3	why ask in an Linux channel about Solaris...?
2011-01-27T17:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hid3	instead of looking at the make etc, look at the components on the board to check compatibility
2011-01-27T17:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hid3	wrong target on that last one, sorry
2011-03-23T10:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hid3	what is the output of: wget -O alsa-info.sh http://alsa-project.org/alsa-info.sh && bash ./alsa-info.sh
2011-03-23T10:41:00.000Z	hid3	ActionParsnip	here's the output: http://www.alsa-project.org/db/?f=a4fac105c4c158727de03997ce2dcaf1408a040a
2011-03-23T10:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hid3	debian isn't supported here
2011-03-23T10:43:00.000Z	hid3	ActionParsnip	actually I have three identical PCs, two with Maverick and one with Debian/Squeeze. All have same problem... :(
2011-03-23T10:43:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	hid3	can you run the script on the ubuntu systems and give the link generated please
2011-03-23T10:44:00.000Z	hid3	ActionParsnip	just a minute
