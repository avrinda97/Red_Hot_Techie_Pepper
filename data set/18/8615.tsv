2007-07-24T13:18:00.000Z	estupendocero		I just got a new sony trinitron that's capable of 1920x1200, I ran "dpkg-configure xserver-xorg", all the settings appear correct, but now my only available screen resolutions are 800x600 and 640x480 - what gives?
2007-07-24T13:19:00.000Z	CompIsMyRx	estupendocero	did you choose the correct driver when reconfiguring xorg?
2007-07-24T13:19:00.000Z	estupendocero	CompIsMyRx	video card driver, you mean?
2007-07-24T13:19:00.000Z	CompIsMyRx	estupendocero	yes
2007-07-24T13:19:00.000Z	estupendocero	CompIsMyRx	I chose the driver I had been using before, which is correct, to the best of my knowledge
2007-07-24T13:20:00.000Z	CompIsMyRx	estupendocero	what card are you using?
2007-07-24T13:20:00.000Z	estupendocero	CompIsMyRx	it is a dinosaur of a video card: s3 virge
2007-07-24T13:20:00.000Z	estupendocero	CompIsMyRx	but it worked before
2007-07-24T13:23:00.000Z	estupendocero		Any ideas? Should I just get a new video card?
2007-07-24T13:28:00.000Z	CompIsMyRx	estupendocero	looks like the s3virge can't handle 1920x1200 with a depth of 24-bit (not enough memory)
2007-07-24T13:29:00.000Z	estupendocero	CompIsMyRx	oh I see - I didn't do my homework. Thanks for helping me out. Do you think it can handle it at a lower color depth?
2007-07-24T13:30:00.000Z	CompIsMyRx	estupendocero	try changing the screen depth to 16 by changing the line "DefaultDepth" in xorg.conf from 24 to 16 and reboot xserver
2007-07-24T13:30:00.000Z	CompIsMyRx	estupendocero	it at least handles 1024x768, or so I've seen

2007-07-24T13:31:00.000Z	estupendocero	CompIsMyRx	thanks for the help, sorry for not RTFM before I asked for help
2007-07-24T13:32:00.000Z	CompIsMyRx	estupendocero	you might want to think about a new card. maybe an ATI9200 if you're on a budget
2007-07-24T13:33:00.000Z	estupendocero	CompIsMyRx	yeah, this is a frankenstein I dumpstered most of
2007-07-24T13:33:00.000Z	estupendocero	CompIsMyRx	maybe it's time I increased my investment in it from my curent $200 :)
