2011-02-03T06:10:00.000Z	Gulfstream	NixGeek	how do I extract it's contents?
2011-02-03T06:11:00.000Z	NixGeek	Gulfstream	the easiest way would be to move it to the ubuntu computer with a flash driver and open it using archive manager.
2011-02-03T06:12:00.000Z	Gulfstream	NixGeek	I tried opening it using Archive Manager, but it gives me an error about it not being a zipfile or something...
2011-02-03T06:13:00.000Z	NixGeek	Gulfstream	try right clicking the file adn using "extract here"
2011-02-03T06:14:00.000Z	Gulfstream	NixGeek	same error...
2011-02-03T06:15:00.000Z	NixGeek	Gulfstream	how about renaming the file to a .zip?
2011-02-03T06:15:00.000Z	Gulfstream	NixGeek	same error...
2011-02-03T06:16:00.000Z	NixGeek	Gulfstream	what is the error exactly?
2011-02-03T06:17:00.000Z	Gulfstream	NixGeek	that's the error...
2011-02-03T06:19:00.000Z	NixGeek	Gulfstream	try redownlaoding it
2011-02-03T06:21:00.000Z	Gulfstream	NixGeek	same error
2011-02-03T06:30:00.000Z	Gulfstream	NixGeek	I tried it in CrossOver to see if it would work...
2011-02-04T06:41:00.000Z	Gulfstream	NixGeek	installed the intel graphics driver and the screen is black - even when the login screen sound plays
2011-02-04T06:42:00.000Z	NixGeek	Gulfstream	pastebin /var/log/Xorg.n.log
2011-02-04T06:43:00.000Z	Gulfstream	NixGeek	how do I login to get that pasted?
2011-02-04T06:45:00.000Z	NixGeek	Gulfstream	woops, forgot about that.  easiest way would be from a live cd, you could do it from a terminal, but copying it to pastebin would be a challenge
2011-02-04T06:47:00.000Z	NixGeek	Gulfstream	I really gotta go for a few minutes, get that pasted and i'll look at it when I get back
