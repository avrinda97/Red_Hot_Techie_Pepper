2011-11-10T00:34:00.000Z	leeping__		Hi there - I have an Ubuntu virtual machine running.  How do I configure multiple monitors on it?  Currently the display is just mirrored across the monitors.
2011-11-10T00:34:00.000Z	nemo	leeping__	System->Preferences->Monitor in gnome2
2011-11-10T00:35:00.000Z	nemo	leeping__	depends though. if using nvidia, you'd need to use their tool
2011-11-10T00:35:00.000Z	nemo	leeping__	and a virtual machine, who knows what the display pretends to be...
2011-11-10T00:35:00.000Z	nemo	leeping__	probably intel, so that should work
2011-11-10T00:35:00.000Z	leeping__	nemo	right, I'm not using Nvidia (it's a macbook pro).  Under monitor preferences, I'm only seeing one.  Maybe if I restart the VM it will work?
2011-11-10T00:36:00.000Z	nemo	leeping__	virtual machine probably not exposing it then
2011-11-10T00:36:00.000Z	leeping__	nemo	that's possible.  Let me play with the settings a little more.  Thanks :)
2011-11-10T00:36:00.000Z	nemo	leeping__	I'd suggest tech support for your VM software.  virtualbox is in #vbox
2011-11-10T00:36:00.000Z	nemo	leeping__	you might also need guest additions. both vmware and vbox have those
2011-11-10T00:37:00.000Z	leeping__	nemo	I don't know what guest additions are.  And yes I went to the #vmware chat, they referred me to a site that told me to change the display settings in the guest OS
2011-11-10T00:38:00.000Z	nemo	leeping__	guest additions integrate the guest and host better. they are hooks into the guest VM
2011-11-10T00:38:00.000Z	nemo	leeping__	often guest ends up w/ nicer gfx cards exposed, instead of just VGA
2011-11-10T00:38:00.000Z	nemo	leeping__	VM is hit or miss though. hard to get specific advice on it. for example, using moka5 over here, I ended up having to hardcode lines for vmware into the xorg.conf
2011-11-10T00:38:00.000Z	nemo	leeping__	stupid vmware driver was being stupid about exposing monitor settings
2011-11-10T00:40:00.000Z	leeping__	nemo	thanks.  I don't think I have any hardware graphics acceleration on this host.  Maybe if I restart the VM it will work, but it's not such a big deal because I have a lot of monitor space. :)
2011-11-10T00:40:00.000Z	nemo	leeping__	anyway. definitely try vmware guest additions
2011-11-10T00:41:00.000Z	leeping__	nemo	thank you.  I will investigate into what "guest additions" are. :)
