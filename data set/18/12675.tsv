2007-12-06T05:21:00.000Z	tuna		I'm trying to get a new ipod working on ubuntu. ubotus quide is useless, does anyone knowhow to do this?
2007-12-06T05:21:00.000Z	pike_	tuna	what prob are you running into
2007-12-06T05:22:00.000Z	pike_	tuna	and what kind of ipod 5.5 gen?
2007-12-06T05:22:00.000Z	pike_	tuna	is it a windows or mac ipod
2007-12-06T05:22:00.000Z	pike_	tuna	ok so it is fat32
2007-12-06T05:23:00.000Z	pike_	tuna	try sudo mkdir /media/ipod; sudo mount -o umask=000 /dev/sdb2 /media/ipod
2007-12-06T05:23:00.000Z	pike_	tuna	if it worked on win its fat32 windows is not intelligent enought to understand many file formats without help
2007-12-06T05:24:00.000Z	pike_	tuna	unplug it and replug then type 'dmesg | tail' does it say sdb or sdc or what
2007-12-06T05:26:00.000Z	pike_	tuna	dmesg | grep "  sd" file.txt | awk "{print $ 4}" | tail -n 1   says what thats a little involved but i copied it from one of my mount scripts :-)
2007-12-06T05:27:00.000Z	pike_	tuna	one sec
2007-12-06T05:27:00.000Z	pike_	tuna	so if you sudo cfdisk /dev/sdb it shows no partitions?
2007-12-06T05:28:00.000Z	pike_	tuna	you have any music saved on it or is it pretty new ipod
2007-12-06T05:30:00.000Z	pike_	tuna	you know what model it is?
2007-12-06T05:32:00.000Z	pike_	tuna	it seems there may be some issues with new nano and linux
2007-12-06T05:33:00.000Z	pike_	tuna	however it has been addressed im just not sure if current packages in gutsy are late enough version to work
2007-12-06T05:35:00.000Z	pike_	tuna	i never had a problem mounting it. i suppose worst case you could run xp in vmware or virtualbox
2007-12-06T05:36:00.000Z	pike_	tuna	i hereby will you my old copy of xp
2007-12-06T05:37:00.000Z	pike_	tuna	sorry wasnt more help. not sure what the issue is i know you can fix it by redoing the partitions in inlinux but youd need to backup your music
