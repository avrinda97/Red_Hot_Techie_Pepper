2006-04-14T06:37:00.000Z	Hexidigital		help with DNS... my router's dhcp server is working... however sometimes my dns will fail (i know it is dns because i can still see new messages on IRC channels)... any ideas?
2006-04-14T06:35:00.000Z	Hexidigital		does wine support civ 4 yet???
2006-04-14T06:35:00.000Z	mwe	Hexidigital	no
2006-04-14T06:36:00.000Z	mwe	Hexidigital	I doubt it will in the near future
2006-04-14T06:36:00.000Z	mwe	Hexidigital	if you want your favorite games you'll probably have to keep windows around
2006-04-14T06:37:00.000Z	Hexidigital	mwe	i know... damn direct x compatability
2006-04-14T06:37:00.000Z	mwe	Hexidigital	yeah that's one issue
2006-04-18T05:34:00.000Z	mwe	Hexidigital	gparted doesn't mount disks
2006-04-18T05:34:00.000Z	Hexidigital	mwe	i know that... but i'm thinking maybe gparted did something bad?
2006-04-18T05:35:00.000Z	mwe	Hexidigital	potentially
2006-04-18T08:38:00.000Z	mwe	Hexidigital	hi
2006-04-21T06:19:00.000Z	mwe	Hexidigital	just don't make anything listen there
2006-04-21T06:19:00.000Z	mwe	Hexidigital	or make an iptables rule
2006-04-21T06:20:00.000Z	Hexidigital	mwe	isn't that a security risk leaving it open?  my router forwards 21 and 80 for hosting purposes, but on my machine 5900 is open
2006-04-21T06:20:00.000Z	mwe	Hexidigital	if nothing is listening it's closed
2006-04-21T06:20:00.000Z	Hexidigital	mwe	ok, thank you
2006-04-21T06:20:00.000Z	mwe	Hexidigital	don't worry if nothing is accepting incoming connections
2006-04-21T06:23:00.000Z	mwe	Hexidigital	yw
