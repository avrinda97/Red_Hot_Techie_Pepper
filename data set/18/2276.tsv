2010-07-01T07:06:00.000Z	ubuntubie		as I was upgrading from 9.10 to 10.04, seemingly just as it started the upgrade process, the screen slowly faded to black.  I was unable to recover from this position, although I could see and move around the mouse cursor.  Finally, after 15 minutes, and pushing of all sorts of key combinations, etc., I pushed the power button on the computer.  After this I saw an error message, and then the comp
2010-07-01T07:07:00.000Z	ubuntubie		froze completely and then I restarted it takes me to the command prompt, so I think something is wrong with the graphics device driver
2010-07-01T07:09:00.000Z	ubuntubie		is the ubuntu live cd capable of doing a repair upgrade install
2010-07-01T07:09:00.000Z	ubuntubie		since it is already installed on the hard drive
2010-07-01T07:11:00.000Z	codebrainz	ubuntubie	so you hard powered off half way during the upgrade?
2010-07-01T07:12:00.000Z	codebrainz	ubuntubie	upgrading from from one ubuntu version to another?
2010-07-01T07:13:00.000Z	ubuntubie	codebrainz	yes I was in that processs, from 9.10 to 10.04, when the screen faded out and then the computer became unresponsive
2010-07-01T07:13:00.000Z	ubuntubie	codebrainz	then I pushed the power button once, and I saw an error reported on-screen in a message-box, and then the comp completely froze, after which I hard-powered-down
2010-07-01T07:14:00.000Z	codebrainz	ubuntubie	yeesh, easiest/best route would prolly be to back up your home dir and re-install from scratch, but there might be a way to continue the upgrade that I'm not aware of
2010-07-01T07:15:00.000Z	ubuntubie	codebrainz	so basically, after that, I was able to boot up but it would only go into the command prompt, not the gui.  So I figured I could \either try to fix the gui problem, which I think may be related to gfx drivers, or try some sort of repair upgrade install using a live cd
2010-07-01T07:16:00.000Z	codebrainz	ubuntubie	so you have a proper shell?
2010-07-01T07:16:00.000Z	ubuntubie	codebrainz	yes, apparently, right now I'm running off of a live-cd so I can use gui-irc
2010-07-01T07:17:00.000Z	ubuntubie	codebrainz	yes, I have a proper shell when I'm booting off of the hd I think
2010-07-01T07:17:00.000Z	codebrainz	ubuntubie	you could try booting back from your install and running 'sudo do-release-upgrade' and see if it will resume from where it left off
2010-07-01T07:18:00.000Z	ubuntubie	codebrainz	okay, i'll try that command, hopefully the gfx problem will be taken care of during that process as well, thanks,
2010-07-01T07:19:00.000Z	codebrainz	ubuntubie	if you don't like the choices conanical makes, you are absolutely free to use any other distro such as debian, but I'd recommend doing a custom install of ubuntu and tweaking it to your desires
2010-07-01T07:21:00.000Z	ubuntubie	codebrainz	i don't even have the ability to form an opinion on the later canonical releases, since I have yet to use anything past 7.10, that's where I started this long upgrade train today.  It got to 9.10, and then all this happened.
2010-07-01T07:21:00.000Z	codebrainz	ubuntubie	i wasn't impressed, but defaults are just that :)
