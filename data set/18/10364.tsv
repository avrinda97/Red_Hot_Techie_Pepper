2006-12-13T13:13:00.000Z	pike_	cardanto1	the video lan client website has alot of howtos. its all gui unless you want to use cli
2006-12-13T13:13:00.000Z	cardanto1		what about drivers for my webcam (it's actually a dv cam -- with a web feature)
2006-12-13T13:13:00.000Z	cardanto1		cli?
2006-12-13T13:13:00.000Z	cardanto1		command line interface . . .?
2006-12-13T13:13:00.000Z	pike_	cardanto1	i dont know alot about webcam drivers. once the cam is working though vlc should make streaming very easy
