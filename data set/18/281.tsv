2012-05-28T14:14:00.000Z	alexxyx		I'm new ubuntu user. I have 12.04 version
2012-05-28T14:15:00.000Z	alexxyx		now, my brother can't get to use all new surrounding
2012-05-28T14:15:00.000Z	alexxyx		so, I'd like to adjust theme to look like windows 7

2012-05-28T14:17:00.000Z	alexxyx		but they won't work (it's for 11. version of ubuntu). So, I had to install Gnome3 (I researched and found out that 12.04 has Unity, but for most win7 themes I need gnome3
2012-05-28T14:19:00.000Z	dr__willis	alexxyx	 you mean gnome-shell?
2012-05-28T14:21:00.000Z	dr__willis	alexxyx	 depends on what irc client you are using.
2012-05-28T14:25:00.000Z	dr__willis	alexxyx	 theres normally some hide part/join feature in most every irc cleient
2012-05-28T14:28:00.000Z	dr__willis	alexxyx	 using such 'scripts' to try to set that stuff up. can cause very bad system breakage.

2012-05-28T14:47:00.000Z	dr__willis	alexxyx	 and its not supported here. while lubuntu, or xubuntu is..
2012-05-28T14:54:00.000Z	dr__willis	alexxyx	 mate is  not supported here. while lubuntu, or xubuntu is..
2012-05-28T14:55:00.000Z	dr__willis	alexxyx	 you add a new repo/ppa you MUST do a 'sudo apt-get update' befor installing  packages from it
