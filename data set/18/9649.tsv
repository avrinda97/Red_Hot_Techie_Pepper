2007-06-20T12:45:00.000Z	mik3		so compiz-like effects aren't available for machines with ATI cards?
2007-06-20T12:46:00.000Z	mik3		kitch: do you know of a url that has all the relative info?
2007-06-20T12:48:00.000Z	mik3		shit i just enabled it
2007-06-20T12:48:00.000Z	mik3		oh ok
2007-06-20T12:48:00.000Z	mik3		cool
2007-06-20T12:49:00.000Z	gerro	mik3	good luck with the 3d desktop but you might want to set it up so you can login to it as a separate desktop session
2007-06-20T12:51:00.000Z	mik3	gerro	why do you suggest that? is it flakey when you log in through your main account?
2007-06-20T12:52:00.000Z	gerro	mik3	you might want to use a regular desktop session instead of beryl
2007-06-20T12:53:00.000Z	mik3	gerro	I don't understand what you mean
2007-06-20T12:53:00.000Z	gerro	mik3	it is still experimental and might not work the version of beryl you are using
2007-06-20T12:53:00.000Z	gerro	mik3	here I'll show you a guide
2007-06-20T12:53:00.000Z	gerro	mik3	what graphics card and is it kubuntu, ubuntu, xubuntu, etc etc
2007-06-20T12:55:00.000Z	gerro	mik3	interesting I was about to setup beryl on the same card with xubuntu
2007-06-20T12:55:00.000Z	mik3	gerro	let me know how it works so I can get rid of gnome
2007-06-20T12:56:00.000Z	gerro	mik3	you won't neccesarily be getting rid of gnome since you will still be using most of its interfaces, its more of a hybrid desktop environment
2007-06-20T12:57:00.000Z	mik3	gerro	in regards to using beryl with it? or with xfce versus gnome in general? xfce blows gnome away in my opinion
2007-06-20T12:58:00.000Z	mik3	gerro	i'll be right back
2007-06-20T12:58:00.000Z	gerro	mik3	yeah I like it too, gnome has great code but ignorant use friendly dumbasses :)
