2008-09-26T02:21:00.000Z	hector		is there any instruction for the kernel?=
2008-09-26T02:21:00.000Z	hector		like CONFIG_HIMEM4G

2008-09-26T02:23:00.000Z	redf1sh	hector	You have to compile the kernel with the options set. I think its called CONFIG_HIGHMEM in your .config, dunno what the options called in a menu.
2008-09-26T02:24:00.000Z	redf1sh	hector	or isntall 64 bit ubuntu, which can do much more ram.

2008-09-26T02:25:00.000Z	redf1sh		﻿strocknar: you can ping your gateway?
2008-09-26T02:25:00.000Z	hector		ok... the 2 options are good in fact i tried to use a 64 bits SO, but some app didnt work
2008-09-26T02:25:00.000Z	redf1sh		﻿strocknar: and other things using the same gateway can get out?
2008-09-26T02:25:00.000Z	redf1sh	hector	you can try the config option, #kernel on freenode should help out there.
2008-09-26T02:26:00.000Z	hector	redf1sh	THX
