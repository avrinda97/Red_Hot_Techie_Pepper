2005-03-04T12:04:00.000Z	apokryphos		It seems like a real nice distro from what I've see on it; very very fast, and emerge seems excellent. It's just the original installation that seems real silly.
2005-03-04T12:05:00.000Z	apokryphos		That channel is hu-uge
2005-03-04T12:06:00.000Z	Dr_willis	apokryphos	 yea - they could make the install better.. but i tend to ssh into the box i am installng it on. and just cut/paste from the install guide.
2005-03-04T12:07:00.000Z	apokryphos	Dr_willis	Sounds like a good idea
2005-03-04T12:09:00.000Z	Dr_willis	apokryphos	 of course once ya get it installed... you rarely need to do it again :P
2005-03-04T12:09:00.000Z	apokryphos	Dr_willis	Might try Gentoo in the coming weeks if I get bored enough.
2005-03-07T10:38:00.000Z	apokryphos	Dr_willis	The one just above ;)
2005-03-07T10:39:00.000Z	Dr_willis	apokryphos	 heh where i missed it? :p
2005-03-07T10:39:00.000Z	apokryphos	Dr_willis	it backs it up for you ;). Just above:  dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xfree86
2005-03-07T10:41:00.000Z	apokryphos	Dr_willis	That I don't know. I know that the x config file is backed up, however, on a reconfigure.
2005-03-07T10:41:00.000Z	Dr_willis	apokryphos	 Yea - I tend to keep backups of all them as sort of a 'history' whenever i make changes.
2005-03-09T09:44:00.000Z	Dr_willis	apokryphos	 i dont mean at the libarary level.. i mean at the 'what the user sees level'
2005-03-09T09:45:00.000Z	apokryphos	Dr_willis	The look? Well, sure, right now you can make Gnome look exactly like kde and visa versa.
2005-03-09T09:46:00.000Z	apokryphos	Dr_willis	Of course, even now, those things are customizable to look just like each other.
2006-10-12T10:22:00.000Z	apokryphos	Dr_willis	it's set the group id
2006-10-12T10:23:00.000Z	Dr_willis	apokryphos	 yea.. i notice in /etc/group   plugdev:x:46:haldaemon,willis
2006-10-12T10:23:00.000Z	apokryphos	Dr_willis	that's the theory, yes.
2006-10-12T10:24:00.000Z	Dr_willis	apokryphos	 just seems odd to use the umask and gid options -  i guess.. :) got me confused
