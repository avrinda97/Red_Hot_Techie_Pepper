2009-04-26T15:54:00.000Z	ironi		Hi, I would like to stop nm-applet to ask for keychain password at every login. I have auto login (andf I am aware of the security) and it annoys me.

2009-04-26T15:56:00.000Z	DERBYSIEGER-icer	ironi	you want auto-login and wlan without typing the keyring-pass?
2009-04-26T15:57:00.000Z	ironi	DERBYSIEGER-icer	yes. and yes I am aware of the security here but it doenst matter
2009-04-26T15:57:00.000Z	DERBYSIEGER-icer	ironi	edit the keyring-pass to an empty one and then auto-login is working without typing keyword for wlan

2009-04-26T15:57:00.000Z	DERBYSIEGER-icer	ironi	its not secure but it is working very well
