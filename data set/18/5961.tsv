2009-01-02T09:22:00.000Z	jtaji	bullgard4	if you drop the stderr redirection you'll see you're getting an error from find
2009-01-02T09:22:00.000Z	jtaji	bullgard4	try 'find / -types'
2009-01-02T09:22:00.000Z	jtaji	bullgard4	sorry... 'find / -type s'
2009-01-02T09:28:00.000Z	bullgard4	jtaji	Thank you very much for your help. --  I wish you a happy new year 2009.
2009-01-07T20:41:00.000Z	jtaji	bullgard4	try 'w' and 'who'
2009-01-15T15:58:00.000Z	bullgard4	jtaji	No.
2009-01-26T07:33:00.000Z	jtaji	bullgard4	web safe colors... no one too much worries about them anymore btw, hardly anyone is still running 8-bit color
2009-01-26T07:35:00.000Z	bullgard4	jtaji	Thank you for anwering. I agree that this only a problem for some special equipment.
2009-01-31T14:10:00.000Z	jtaji	bullgard4	if you install linux-source then you do not need linux-doc... linux-source has the documentation in it's normal place, and linux-doc has it in /usr/doc for people who don't need the source
2009-01-31T14:11:00.000Z	jtaji	bullgard4	so the solutio is aptitude remove linux-doc ;)
2009-01-31T14:13:00.000Z	bullgard4	jtaji	I did not understand your sentence: "for people who don't need the source." Please elaborate.
2009-01-31T14:13:00.000Z	jtaji	bullgard4	if you don't need the kernel source, and just want to read the docs
2009-01-31T14:16:00.000Z	bullgard4	jtaji	Ok. --  You say: "linux-source has the documentation in it's normal place." What is its normal place?
2009-01-31T14:17:00.000Z	jtaji	bullgard4	I should have said it's in the kernel tarball along with the source
2009-01-31T14:18:00.000Z	bullgard4	jtaji	Ok. Thank you very much for your help.
2009-05-27T17:52:00.000Z	jtaji	bullgard4	what do you mean it complains at i? you get nothing back from fi<tab><tab> ?
2009-05-27T17:53:00.000Z	bullgard4	jtaji	"complains" means that it does not echo the i but makes an objecting sound.
