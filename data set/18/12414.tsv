2006-04-21T15:00:00.000Z	georgedh		hello
2006-04-21T15:00:00.000Z	georgedh		can i ask a question?
2006-04-21T15:01:00.000Z	georgedh		is Ubuntu an embedded version of Linux?  I'm new to this
2006-04-21T15:01:00.000Z	georgedh		i'm not even sure what embedded version means.... i just heard it
2006-04-21T15:02:00.000Z	Warbo	georgedh	Embedded is small computers, usually Flash based not Hard Drive, which can be left on to be, say, an information access point
2006-04-21T15:03:00.000Z	georgedh	Warbo	ohh thanks.. so to have Ubuntu isntalled  on my pc from a dick isn't embedded then?
2006-04-21T15:05:00.000Z	georgedh	Warbo	I'm not sure what you said means.  but am i right to think it means havign Ubuntu installed from a diSC (sorry) on my pc wouldn't be embedded?
2006-04-21T15:05:00.000Z	Warbo	georgedh	Embedded systems are usually specially designed. Ubuntu is a standard, generic installation for PCs (32 and 64 bit) and PowerPC (older AppleMacs, OpenDesktopWorkstation, PegasOS, etc)
2006-04-21T15:06:00.000Z	Warbo	georgedh	Embedded is a bit of a "buzz word" really, it can mean what you want it to. It could be argued that any PC is an embedded system
2006-04-21T15:07:00.000Z	georgedh	Warbo	ahhh ok. thanks. i ought to do some reading up on this. I'm lacking in the more dtetailed computer knowledge other than click here dreg there etc
2006-04-21T15:23:00.000Z	Warbo	georgedh	Non-free in Linux means you can't do what you want with it
2006-04-21T15:15:00.000Z	Warbo	georgedh	What does it do? There may be something similar in Ubuntu (sounds like maybe Gnomemeeting/Ekiga)
2006-04-21T15:17:00.000Z	georgedh	Warbo	Paltalk is a chat program that haas rooms you chat in text and in voice.  like whole groups of people open a room and take turns using the mic to talk.
2006-04-21T15:18:00.000Z	Warbo	georgedh	Oh. Well I guess you know about Yahoo! and Jabber and stuff, so GAIM is out?
2006-04-21T15:20:00.000Z	Warbo	georgedh	Skye uses voice chat over peer2peer, so you route everyone else's voice and it is supposed to be really bad for your HD. Try Ekiga
2006-04-21T15:23:00.000Z	georgedh	Warbo	oh i didnt realize...   too bad.   Paltalk is better probably..... a lot of people from around the world go there and I ahvent heard of any such problms
2006-04-21T15:23:00.000Z	Warbo	georgedh	I'm gonna try it in WINE if you give me a sec
