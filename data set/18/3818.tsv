2009-07-25T03:09:00.000Z	benalink		guys is it possible to run  the .img file without a usb
2009-07-25T03:11:00.000Z	benalink		guys is it possible to run  the .img file without a usb? For the install. As i would like to install ubuntu but dont have a usb or cd drive is it possible
2009-07-25T03:11:00.000Z	lstarnes	benalink	you could run it in a virtual machine
2009-07-25T03:12:00.000Z	benalink	lstarnes	 explain?
2009-07-25T03:12:00.000Z	lstarnes	benalink	a vitrual machine is an application that simulates an entire computer
2009-07-25T03:13:00.000Z	lstarnes	benalink	"emulates" would probably be more appropriate than "simulates"
2009-07-25T03:13:00.000Z	lstarnes	benalink	it depends on the virtual machine being used
2009-07-25T03:14:00.000Z	lstarnes	benalink	physical machines can't boot from a file system image.  They need actual file systems
2009-07-25T03:14:00.000Z	lstarnes	benalink	virtualbox is fairly easy to use
2009-07-25T03:15:00.000Z	lstarnes	benalink	changing file extensions does nothing useful
2009-07-25T03:15:00.000Z	lstarnes	benalink	a .img file is a filesystem image
2009-07-25T03:15:00.000Z	lstarnes	benalink	you have to burn it to a disk or a flash drive
2009-07-25T03:16:00.000Z	lstarnes	benalink	or you could try loading it with a virtual machine
2009-07-25T03:16:00.000Z	lstarnes	benalink	install a virtual machine and run it
2009-07-25T03:17:00.000Z	lstarnes	benalink	virtualbox is one
2009-07-25T03:19:00.000Z	lstarnes	benalink	I think it boots over a network
2009-07-25T03:22:00.000Z	lstarnes	benalink	what error?
