2010-01-31T11:43:00.000Z	MauritianGuy		i need some help
2010-01-31T11:43:00.000Z	MauritianGuy		with partioning and dual booting
2010-01-31T11:43:00.000Z	MauritianGuy		well i want to add an extra Os to my boot loader
2010-01-31T11:43:00.000Z	MauritianGuy		thanks ShazbotMcMurder
2010-01-31T11:44:00.000Z	sebsebseb	MauritianGuy	what are you trying to dual boot?
2010-01-31T11:45:00.000Z	sebsebseb	MauritianGuy	apparantly with Karmic/9.10's  Grub 2, because of the way it's been done, can't dual/multi boot  with other distros
2010-01-31T11:46:00.000Z	sebsebseb	MauritianGuy	anyway dual booting or triple or whatever booting OS's isn't that great really,  you could pick a distro and virtual machine others, with enough RAM and such
2010-01-31T11:47:00.000Z	sebsebseb	MauritianGuy	there's the old Grub in the repo as an option,  Fedora's Grub could boot up Ubuntu as well.  The Windows boot loader can be edited some how to boot up Linux distros.
2010-01-31T11:52:00.000Z	sebsebseb	MauritianGuy	Fedora uses Grub and so yeah
2010-01-31T11:53:00.000Z	sebsebseb	MauritianGuy	Fedora's boot loader can boot up Ubuntu and Windows
2010-01-31T11:54:00.000Z	sebsebseb	MauritianGuy	should do yes, if not you can set it up to
2010-01-31T11:54:00.000Z	sebsebseb	MauritianGuy	also if you end up using Fedora's Grub,  you should be asking  #fedora or  #grub for help really
2010-01-31T11:54:00.000Z	sebsebseb	MauritianGuy	if it needs setting up
2010-01-31T11:55:00.000Z	MauritianGuy	sebsebseb	 well i did partion properly and it did the instann when i came to choosing bootloader i did not choose anything i thaught it was possible to manually add an os from ubuntu boot loder
2010-01-31T11:55:00.000Z	sebsebseb	MauritianGuy	I thought Ubuntu's Grub 2 could be used to boot up other distros, but apparantly not
2010-01-31T11:56:00.000Z	sebsebseb	MauritianGuy	personally I woudn't bother having more than one distro psyicall installed.  any other distro I would want, I would just virtual machine
2010-01-31T11:58:00.000Z	sebsebseb	MauritianGuy	which one?  Virtualbos is rather nice
