2005-02-04T08:42:00.000Z	DAC1138		wtf is up with ubuntu?
2005-02-04T08:43:00.000Z	jdub	DAC1138	what do you need to build your own kernel for?
2005-02-04T08:43:00.000Z	DAC1138	jdub	because i do, that should be reason enough

2005-02-04T08:45:00.000Z	jdub	DAC1138	there are a lot of stupid reasons for building kernels. :)
2005-02-04T08:48:00.000Z	jdub	DAC1138	that's unnecessary here.
2005-02-04T08:48:00.000Z	jdub	DAC1138	why do you think you need to build a kernel to get your display working?
2005-02-04T08:49:00.000Z	jdub	DAC1138	modern pcs are all based around pci, be they desktops or laptops.
2005-02-04T08:49:00.000Z	DAC1138	jdub	its all in the link i posted
2005-02-04T08:49:00.000Z	jdub	DAC1138	i've read the link. i have the same hardware (video, not laptop).
2005-02-04T08:49:00.000Z	DAC1138	jdub	the xserver has a special driver which needs the kernel source for the current running kernel. the one i downloaded didnt work...so im building a new kernel
2005-02-08T10:39:00.000Z	jdub	DAC1138	file a bug, attach the logs
2005-02-08T10:50:00.000Z	jdub	DAC1138	click new, type in your info, hit commit. go back to that bug and attach your files.
2005-02-08T10:57:00.000Z	jdub	DAC1138	you need to attach the logs
2005-02-08T10:57:00.000Z	jdub	DAC1138	asking someone to mail you for them means extra work and less likely for your bug to be fixed
2005-02-08T10:58:00.000Z	DAC1138	jdub	i attached them
2005-02-09T17:36:00.000Z	jdub	DAC1138	build-essential
