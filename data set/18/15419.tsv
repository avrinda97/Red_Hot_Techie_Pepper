2005-04-03T16:03:00.000Z	slept	setite2	you don't want to use the live cd , if you do you have to chroot and you'll be running the same system as if you would boot.
2005-04-03T16:04:00.000Z	slept	setite2	you don't need all that things, just boot your system ( not the live-cd ) , dosn't matter if safemode or not
2005-04-03T16:05:00.000Z	slept	setite2	fix the configuration file
2005-04-03T16:07:00.000Z	slept	setite2	yes
