2010-07-19T23:36:00.000Z	^peanut^		samba*
2010-07-19T23:37:00.000Z	froschi	^peanut^	well, apropos, 'share files overt the network' 'this feature cannot be enabled because the required packages are not installed' <- gah? where is the button to install those?
2010-07-19T23:38:00.000Z	froschi	^peanut^	and the help doesn't tell the packages' names either
2010-07-19T23:39:00.000Z	^peanut^	froschi	if you install the 2 samba packages from the software center that I mentioned above, then run the samba configuration app from system tools, you should be good to go
2010-07-19T23:41:00.000Z	froschi	^peanut^	well, the help says, it's exported via webdav, which i would like to use very much for some days for other reasons. is this still via samba? not apache+webdav or so?
2010-07-19T23:41:00.000Z	^peanut^	froschi	webdav and samba having nothing to do with each other. Web dav as the name implies is a web service run from apache
2010-07-19T23:43:00.000Z	froschi	^peanut^	rite, that's what i said :) to i seem to have to install that... just wouldn't know that as a noobi
2010-07-19T23:43:00.000Z	^peanut^	froschi	sorry man. I may have missed something you said
2010-07-20T03:51:00.000Z	^peanut^	froschi	tryin to extract a file from gnome?
2010-07-20T03:52:00.000Z	froschi	^peanut^	'from' gnoem? maybe :) clicked on 'open', then 'extract' somwhere
2010-07-20T03:53:00.000Z	^peanut^	froschi	what type of file is it? *.gz *.bz2? *.zip?
2010-07-20T03:53:00.000Z	froschi	^peanut^	bz2
2010-07-20T03:54:00.000Z	^peanut^	froschi	try openning a terminal, cd to the location of the *.bz2 and run bunzip "filename.bz2"
2010-07-20T03:55:00.000Z	froschi	^peanut^	yeah, doing that atm...  i think it's running out of diskspace... makes a strange file in some subdir first... maybe wants to COPY, not MOVE in the end... is this a know bug?
2010-07-20T03:56:00.000Z	^peanut^	froschi	not sure if it's a bug. could you paste the output from your shell when it finishes? or fails?
2010-07-20T03:57:00.000Z	froschi	^peanut^	bunzip worked fine... :/ only cost me ~10 minutes waiting... think i'm going back to cmdline for all needs where possible :/
2010-07-20T03:57:00.000Z	^peanut^	froschi	I'm so terminal bound for most things.  =) it's nice
