2010-04-11T11:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	hasibullah	 install ubuntu-restricted-extras package and the w32codecs pack from medibuntu and you will have most of them you need.
2010-04-11T11:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	hasibullah	 also use the vlc player. and it should play most of them.
2010-05-01T13:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	hasibullah	 theres numerous firefox extensions for that.
2010-05-01T13:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	hasibullah	 or other scripts that can do it.
2010-05-01T13:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	hasibullah	 xVideoServiceThief  is a neat tool for that also
2010-05-09T13:37:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	hasibullah	 'vnc' is one way.
2010-05-09T13:40:00.000Z	hasibullah	Dr_Willis	so then we can see xp clients yes
2010-05-09T13:40:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	hasibullah	 install vnc on all the machines and they can see/share/access each others desktops. I use 'ultravnc' on windows normally
2010-05-09T13:42:00.000Z	hasibullah	Dr_Willis	i don't want to install vnc on xp clients i need to see from linux without installing vnc on client
2010-05-09T13:44:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	hasibullah	 theres some sort of remote desktop client/service that uses the RDP or whatever its called feature of windows.. but i never use it. I find vnc more flexiable

2010-11-14T13:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	hasibullah	 tht would depend on the stream/site

2010-11-14T13:51:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	hasibullah	 ive no idea what 'IDM' is...
