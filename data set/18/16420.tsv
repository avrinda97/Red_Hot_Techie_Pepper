2005-09-24T12:41:00.000Z	nerdunit		at least that what i think
2005-09-24T12:42:00.000Z	nerdunit		I burn the CD from my pc with deepburner and then attempted to boot to it and it simply ingnore my command and booted to the mac os that is currently installed
2005-09-24T12:42:00.000Z	nerdunit		all i want is ubuntu on my imac
2005-09-24T12:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	nerdunit	 have you googled for the alternative4 ways to make the thing boot the cd?
2005-09-24T12:43:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		just "C" does not always work
2005-09-24T12:43:00.000Z	nerdunit		I tried to do that and it didn;t work
2005-09-24T12:44:00.000Z	nerdunit		I didn't find any other ways of booting from cd on google, just "C"
2005-09-24T12:45:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	nerdunit	 thers at least 3 ways.  ->   just googled and found -->  holding down shift-command-option-delete instead
2005-09-24T12:46:00.000Z	nerdunit		command is open apple Right?
2005-09-24T12:47:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	nerdunit	 no clue. - also you may want to be sure the caps lock is OFF.. hold down c.. reboot and KEEP the C held down..
2005-09-24T12:48:00.000Z	nerdunit		okay i'll try again
2005-09-24T12:50:00.000Z	Dr_Willis		a text editor. :P
2005-09-24T12:54:00.000Z	nerdunit	dr_willis	the follwoing happened
2005-09-24T12:55:00.000Z	nerdunit	dr_willis	I attempted both way and they both yielded a little folder with a question mark and the finder logo, after which the os. booted to a error message that said the disk is not readable and needs to be initialized with a drop  down menu that offer initialization options
2005-09-24T12:57:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	nerdunit	 time to go check in #OSX or other channels  then.
