2009-09-17T23:35:00.000Z	fabian5003		Ok,  bye everyone, thanks for your help....

2009-09-17T23:36:00.000Z	fabian5003		Its text is extremely important!!!!
2009-09-17T23:37:00.000Z	fabian5003		The file was deleted from a USB, I recovered but it's broken... it display some weird unicode characters...
2009-09-17T23:37:00.000Z	MarderIII	fabian5003	then it was overwritten..
2009-09-17T23:38:00.000Z	fabian5003	MarderIII	and there's anyway to fix it????
2009-09-17T23:39:00.000Z	MarderIII	fabian5003	nope. your only chance is to find and recover a temporary file. if that cant be done your file is lost for good.
2009-09-17T23:40:00.000Z	MarderIII	fabian5003	recovererd how?
2009-09-17T23:40:00.000Z	MarderIII	fabian5003	with "photorec" ?
2009-09-17T23:41:00.000Z	fabian5003		The recovery program says the file is "Excelent" but when I recovered, it shows those characters anyway. :(
