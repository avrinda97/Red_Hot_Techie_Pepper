2010-05-02T20:03:00.000Z	Esteban		Hello, I'm having a resolution problem that i actually asked for help here, but i did everything i was told.. and i can't still get to change to 1024x768 resolution. That resolution is shown in xrandr but when i select it all i get is a black space when i scroll down, any ideas? here's my xorg.conf file http://pastebin.com/rPTfrMyt
2010-05-02T20:05:00.000Z	intugo	Esteban	Does your monitor support higher than 1024x786
2010-05-02T20:05:00.000Z	Esteban	intugo	 no
2010-05-02T20:06:00.000Z	Esteban	intugo	I'm trying to set to that resolution, but whenever i do that i can scroll down and see a black space
2010-05-02T20:09:00.000Z	intugo	Esteban	Open Terminal and do this > sudo dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2010-05-02T20:09:00.000Z	Esteban	intugo	ok
2010-05-02T20:09:00.000Z	Esteban	intugo	 and now?
2010-05-02T20:09:00.000Z	intugo	Esteban	Follow the procedure.
2010-05-02T20:10:00.000Z	Esteban	intugo	i did that, nothing happened...or at least i didn't see anything on the console
2010-05-02T20:13:00.000Z	intugo	Esteban	Just for verification, what version do you use?
2010-05-02T20:13:00.000Z	Esteban	intugo	ubuntu 10.04
2010-05-02T20:15:00.000Z	intugo	Esteban	Does it prompt you anything?
2010-05-02T20:15:00.000Z	Esteban	intugo	no
2010-05-02T20:18:00.000Z	intugo	Esteban	Run gksudo nvidia-settings in terminal
2010-05-02T20:18:00.000Z	Esteban	intugo	i already did that, but there's no higher resolution than 640x480
2010-05-02T20:21:00.000Z	intugo	Esteban	Go to System > Administration > Hardware Drivers. Do you see any drivers installed? If so, how many?
2010-05-02T20:21:00.000Z	Esteban	intugo	I see 3 drivers, one of them is the recommeded one, i'm using that one.. but i also tried the others
2010-05-02T20:29:00.000Z	intugo	Esteban	Question, do you use a Computer Monitor or a TV as your screen?
