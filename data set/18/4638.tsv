2012-07-04T13:14:00.000Z	sixofour		what size would you recommend for the ubuntu partition and swap? i have 6gb of ram
2012-07-04T13:14:00.000Z	sixofour		the "data" partition will be the win7 stuff
2012-07-04T13:15:00.000Z	sixofour		well, its a gaming pc really, i7, ati radeon 6 something HD, 6gb ram
2012-07-04T13:15:00.000Z	sixofour		though all i really play is minecraft and a few other indie games
2012-07-04T13:16:00.000Z	sixofour		why not 8gb swap jsut so its a nice number? :P
2012-07-04T13:16:00.000Z	sixofour		the ubuntu partition needs to be a bit i think, 20gb sound good enough? this is jsut for ubuntu system stuff
2012-07-04T13:17:00.000Z	sixofour		1gb swamp partition?
2012-07-04T13:17:00.000Z	sixofour		hmm
2012-07-04T13:18:00.000Z	sixofour		anyways, about my first question, can ubuntu be installed from the hardrive, or do i need to make a boot disk? win7 is being retarded and doesn't seem to know how to make a boot disk
2012-07-04T13:19:00.000Z	sixofour		can you boot from an sd card?
2012-07-04T13:19:00.000Z	Dr_willis	sixofour	 i have some pcs that can boot and install from an SD card.
2012-07-04T13:19:00.000Z	Dr_willis	sixofour	 i have some that cant.
2012-07-04T14:33:00.000Z	Dr_willis	sixofour	 its  nothing like the ipad.. and unity has some very nice features.
2012-07-04T14:44:00.000Z	Dr_willis	sixofour	 most are going to gnome3/gnome-shell.
2012-07-04T15:11:00.000Z	sixofour	Dr_willis	 how do I show the scroll bars?
2012-07-04T15:17:00.000Z	Dr_willis	sixofour	 the webupd8 blog site has a guide listing common tweaks people like to use - that include  disabling the hidd4en scrollbars
2012-07-04T15:54:00.000Z	Dr_willis	sixofour	 see mint channels for mint support
2012-07-04T15:56:00.000Z	Dr_willis	sixofour	 no its not.. you just install the other os over it..
