2005-11-10T14:03:00.000Z	frogzoo		wondering why people on Ubuntu bother with kde, seeing as gnome is "standard" ?
2005-11-10T14:03:00.000Z	crimsun	frogzoo	choice.
2005-11-10T14:04:00.000Z	frogzoo	crimsun	sure, and I respect that, just I choose to be lazy :D
2005-12-07T15:05:00.000Z	frogzoo	crimsun	& the rec'dd way is?
2005-12-07T15:09:00.000Z	frogzoo	crimsun	points out these config lines belong in /etc/modules.d/tulip - not /etc/mocules
2005-12-11T12:17:00.000Z	frogzoo	crimsun	a world executable /root does appear interesting - would be better not
2006-12-10T16:41:00.000Z	crimsun	frogzoo	you shouldn't be needing to use esd
2006-12-10T16:41:00.000Z	frogzoo	crimsun	yes? so just turn it off in sound prefs?
2006-12-10T16:42:00.000Z	crimsun	frogzoo	afaik you have to enable esd to have system sounds. What's the real issue?
2006-12-10T16:42:00.000Z	frogzoo	crimsun	the issue is system sounds don't work
2006-12-10T16:43:00.000Z	frogzoo	crimsun	also various sound problems - amarok won't mix with audio from flash
2006-12-10T16:44:00.000Z	crimsun	frogzoo	that's symptomatic of Flash 7; is that the Flash version you're using?
2006-12-10T16:45:00.000Z	frogzoo	crimsun	nope - flash 9d78
2006-12-10T16:46:00.000Z	crimsun	frogzoo	from edgy-backports?
2006-12-10T16:49:00.000Z	frogzoo	crimsun	nope, from macromedia, anyways, I"ll have a bit of a poke around
2006-12-10T16:49:00.000Z	crimsun	frogzoo	do you still have flashplugin-nonfree installed?
2006-12-10T16:54:00.000Z	frogzoo	crimsun	nope - the install for flash 9 is a straight cut/paste from https://help.ubuntu.com/community/RestrictedFormats
2006-12-10T16:56:00.000Z	frogzoo	crimsun	all fixed - esd wasn't running - because I had a leftover ~/.asoundrc.asoundconf file
