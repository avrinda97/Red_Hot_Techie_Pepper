2007-08-22T08:03:00.000Z	tarvid		any have a workaround for arrow keys in gnome-terminal
2007-08-22T08:03:00.000Z	wastrel	tarvid	 what's the problem with arrow keys in gnome-terminal?
2007-08-22T08:04:00.000Z	tarvid	wastrel	in vi, the arrow keys generate extraneous text
2007-08-22T08:06:00.000Z	wastrel	tarvid	 echo $TERM
2007-08-22T08:06:00.000Z	wastrel	tarvid	 also $LANG
2007-08-22T08:06:00.000Z	tarvid	wastrel	xterm
2007-08-22T08:07:00.000Z	wastrel	tarvid	 okey dokey  that looks fine to me.  you don't have a problem :] 
2007-08-22T08:08:00.000Z	tarvid	wastrel	I do have a problem gnome-terminal is almost unusable for remove editing of files
2007-08-22T08:08:00.000Z	wastrel	tarvid	 what vi are you using? vim?  what keyboard layout?
2007-08-22T08:08:00.000Z	wastrel	tarvid	 arrow keys work just fine in vi (vim) for me
2007-08-22T08:10:00.000Z	wastrel	tarvid	 this is only on a remote system?
2007-08-22T08:11:00.000Z	tarvid	wastrel	locally it works
2007-08-22T08:11:00.000Z	wastrel	tarvid	 prolly remote system is not understanding your LANG thingy.  try export LANG=C on the remote system then run vi
2007-08-22T08:12:00.000Z	tarvid	wastrel	sorry that was meant for you
2007-08-22T08:12:00.000Z	wastrel	tarvid	 are you using screen?
2007-08-22T08:14:00.000Z	wastrel	tarvid	 i dunno...  can't think of any other reasons it might be broken.  i bet changing the LANG to C would help  but it's a hackish workaround.
2007-08-22T08:15:00.000Z	tarvid	wastrel	after export LANG=C I get the same results
2007-08-22T08:24:00.000Z	tarvid	wastrel	the secret was to install vim
