2008-03-31T01:25:00.000Z	JustJaden		If I edit a file, how do I quit and save?
2008-03-31T01:25:00.000Z	JustJaden		in the terminal I mean
2008-03-31T01:27:00.000Z	JustJaden		I just added, something to the blacklist, and I want to exit and save
2008-03-31T01:27:00.000Z	LjL	JustJaden	"terminal" is just a place where you execute text-mode programs.
2008-03-31T01:42:00.000Z	LjL	JustJaden	or stop hurting yourself, and use nano or gedit
2008-03-31T01:42:00.000Z	LjL	JustJaden	by typing "nano" and "gedit" respectively, quite surprisingly :)
2008-03-31T01:44:00.000Z	LjL	JustJaden	i doubt it, you must have mistyped
2008-03-31T01:49:00.000Z	LjL	JustJaden	type the following in a terminal: « ls -l /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist », what does it show?
2008-03-31T01:51:00.000Z	JustJaden	LjL	it sayse Cannot access: No such file or directory
2008-03-31T01:52:00.000Z	LjL	JustJaden	weird, it should exist by default. what about « ls -l /etc/modprobe.d » ?
2008-03-31T01:52:00.000Z	JustJaden	LjL	that shows me a large list of stuff
2008-03-31T01:53:00.000Z	LjL	JustJaden	well *shrug* then just edit the empty /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist file, it should work.
2008-03-31T02:39:00.000Z	LjL	JustJaden	define "not working" (also, why are you using it?)
2008-03-31T02:53:00.000Z	LjL	JustJaden	what does "uname -r" say?
2008-03-31T02:54:00.000Z	LjL	JustJaden	until you don't type it, you won't know. i'm telling you to type « uname -r » and tell me what it says.
2008-03-31T02:54:00.000Z	LjL	JustJaden	it probably says 2.6.24-12-generic, doesn't it?
2008-03-31T02:56:00.000Z	JustJaden	LjL	it still keeps telling me It couldn't find the package "linux-headers-uname -r
2008-03-31T02:56:00.000Z	LjL	JustJaden	and what does « apt-cache policy linux-headers-2.6.25-12-generic | grep Cand » say?
