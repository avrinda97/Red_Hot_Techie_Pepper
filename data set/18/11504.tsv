2006-07-21T16:22:00.000Z	munzir	ranDomized	I just tried this vino and it's saying "Users can view your desktop using this command: vncviewer localhost:0"
2006-07-21T16:23:00.000Z	munzir	ranDomized	shouldn't it report the ip? is it really port 0?
2006-07-21T16:23:00.000Z	ranDomized	munzir	it's listening on 127.0.0.1
2006-07-21T16:23:00.000Z	ranDomized	munzir	default vnc port is 5900
2006-07-21T16:23:00.000Z	ranDomized	munzir	you should be able to tell it to listen to remote interface
2006-07-21T16:26:00.000Z	munzir	ranDomized	ok I did vino-preferences and enable it and close. now vncviewer localhost:0 says unable to connect to vnc server and netstat shows no port related to vino open
2006-07-21T16:27:00.000Z	ranDomized	munzir	restart vino
2006-07-21T16:28:00.000Z	munzir	ranDomized	how?
2006-07-21T16:28:00.000Z	ranDomized		munzir,i have just looked, you cant tell it to listen somewhere else but localhost
2006-07-21T16:29:00.000Z	munzir	ranDomized	ok I want it to listen to localhost only how?
2006-07-21T16:29:00.000Z	ranDomized	munzir	what's the point ?
2006-07-21T16:30:00.000Z	munzir	ranDomized	I don't have a vino binary only vino-preferences and it didn't start
2006-07-21T16:32:00.000Z	ranDomized	munzir	/usr/lib/vino/vino-server
2006-07-21T16:32:00.000Z	ranDomized	munzir	or restart your gnome-session
2006-07-21T16:34:00.000Z	munzir	ranDomized	thx a lot it worked now but it was not obvious that the binary is on the lib directory and not on the path
2006-07-21T16:36:00.000Z	ranDomized	munzir	i know, dpkg --L vino is your friend
2006-07-21T16:36:00.000Z	munzir	ranDomized	it's very nice. now I tried it and it allow remote access not just from localhost
2006-07-21T16:37:00.000Z	ranDomized	munzir	be a bit careful though
