2007-05-22T13:59:00.000Z	Pelo	tWs_Mortorojo	 check the private msg windows on your clients,  you just got a msg from ubotu with instructions about the alternate install cd

2007-05-22T14:01:00.000Z	Pelo	tWs_Mortorojo	 apparently the bot is lagging a bit,  you can download the alternate install cd fom the www.ubuntu.com site it is text based and install a vesa driver until you can get a proer driver for your dard
