2008-02-10T09:02:00.000Z	Dr_willis	monte	 nope.. and ive told ya what you need to do. :) enable the medibuntu repo. install the w32codec pack
2008-02-10T10:11:00.000Z	Dr_willis	monte	 time to really read some of the ubuntu starter guides. :)
2008-03-01T11:51:00.000Z	Dr_willis	monte	 sudo mkdir /media/whatever           then sudo mount /dev/whatever /media/whatever
2008-03-01T11:51:00.000Z	Dr_willis	monte	 you may want to use some mount optiuons - dependiong on what you are trying to do.
2008-03-01T11:53:00.000Z	Dr_willis	monte	 use whatever diretory name you want.  it dosent matter.
2008-03-01T11:54:00.000Z	Dr_willis	monte	 how about mkdir /media/MYPORN
2008-03-01T11:54:00.000Z	monte	Dr_willis	do i do it in the terminal?
2008-03-01T11:55:00.000Z	Dr_willis	monte	 you asked how to do it in the terminal...
2008-03-01T12:12:00.000Z	Dr_willis	monte	 i would guess you are yusing the wrong device name then. :)
2008-03-01T12:13:00.000Z	Dr_willis	monte	 what IS the device name you are trying to mount? i dont have ESP :)
2008-03-01T12:14:00.000Z	Dr_willis	monte	 ' sudo mount /dev/YOURDEVICENAME /media/YourMountPoint    '  is the basics of it all.
2008-03-01T12:16:00.000Z	monte	Dr_willis	this will probably help you help me lol
2008-03-01T12:17:00.000Z	Dr_willis	monte	 if you want to mount /dev/sde1 then you use sudo mount /dev/sde1  /media/WHATEVERYOUWANTTOUSE
2008-03-01T12:21:00.000Z	Dr_willis	monte	 if windows crashes and the ntfs filesystem is flagged as needing checked -  the ntfs-3g drivers wont let it get mounted.
2008-03-01T12:22:00.000Z	Dr_willis	monte	 You may want to boot to windows and let it scan the filesystem a few times to verify its good. and then shutdown properly in windows.. and check the various linux/ntfs/ntfs-3g guides on how to properly mount a ntfs-filesystem under linux.
