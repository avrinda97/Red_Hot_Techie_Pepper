2006-11-17T11:16:00.000Z	Xal2		Hi
2006-11-17T11:17:00.000Z	Xal2		Linux isn't seeing my partitions. They showed up correclty in my previous Ubuntu installation, but in setup, it shows a hard drive with no partitions.
2006-11-17T11:17:00.000Z	Xal2		I tried to enter qtparted, but I get the following error:
2006-11-17T11:17:00.000Z	Xal2		critical error during ped_disk_new
2006-11-17T11:18:00.000Z	Xal2		Can anyone here help me out?
2006-11-17T11:18:00.000Z	soundray	Xal2	I'm not familiar with that error, but I hope you have a backup...
2006-11-17T11:19:00.000Z	Xal2	soundray	I don't care about the files... It's just that I don't want to start this crap over.
2006-11-17T11:19:00.000Z	soundray	Xal2	no, but I would just try creating a new partition table. I.e. treat the disk as if it was brand new.
2006-11-17T11:20:00.000Z	soundray	Xal2	you haven't modified any settings in the BIOS setup relating to LBA or similar?
2006-11-17T11:21:00.000Z	soundray	Xal2	check the output of 'sudo fdisk -l'. Any partitions seen by that tool?
2006-11-17T11:22:00.000Z	soundray	Xal2	some good news at least...
2006-11-17T11:22:00.000Z	soundray	Xal2	is downloading and installing from the Alternate CD an option for you?
2006-11-17T11:23:00.000Z	soundray	Xal2	that's seriously weird.
2006-11-17T11:24:00.000Z	soundray	Xal2	could you get another HD and use it as the system disk? You would then have a larger choice of tools to repair the problematic disk with.
2006-11-17T11:25:00.000Z	soundray	Xal2	you currently have a working older ubuntu on that disk?
2006-11-17T11:26:00.000Z	soundray	Xal2	you formatted it how?
2006-11-17T11:28:00.000Z	soundray	Xal2	you could try rewriting the same partition table that fdisk -l sees, by running fdisk /dev/hdX and typing 'w'.
2006-11-17T11:29:00.000Z	soundray	Xal2	sudo fdisk /dev/hdX then
