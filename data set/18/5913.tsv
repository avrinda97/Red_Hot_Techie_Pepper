2008-08-07T17:32:00.000Z	CHR15		Uh, hi. I have been trying to get these drivers to work on Hardy for my 8600 GT and all it keeps doing for each driver is setting my max resolution to 640x480. Any suggestions?
2008-08-07T17:34:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	CHR15	same happened to me on my card strangely deleting conky and soft restart "as i call it" and running command gksudo displayconfig-gtk "if it doesnt run automacally" helps to set up the res
2008-08-07T17:35:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	CHR15	oops deleting xorg.conf
2008-08-07T17:35:00.000Z	CHR15	Pirate_Hunter	wow that seem's out there but I'm open for anything right about now.
2008-08-07T17:36:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	CHR15	im guessing im gonna have to guide you but because it worked for me may not work for you so be aware
2008-08-07T17:37:00.000Z	CHR15	Pirate_Hunter	Yea, a query would be nice, I'm running blind here, persay.
2008-08-07T17:40:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	CHR15	start by typing in terminal gksudo nautilus, go to /etc/X11/ folder and delete xorg.conf file and any other similar copies, afterwards do ctrl+alt+bckspc. This will send you into X basically command line wait a few secs and gdm or displayconfig will popup if not just login and type gksudo displayconfig-gtk and set your resolution under generic as well as motherboard "i had to do this twice but the second time instead of gksudo
2008-08-07T17:41:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	CHR15	before i forget just incase backup your current xorg.conf file doubt youll need it but just do so
2008-08-07T17:41:00.000Z	CHR15	Pirate_Hunter	I have a few backups of it saved, give me a minute and I will try this
2008-08-07T17:46:00.000Z	CHR15	Pirate_Hunter	It worked but I am driverless and Compiz turns me on. LOL
2008-08-07T17:48:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	CHR15	you shouldve set your board driver just run it again nto the whole thing just the displayconfig command and set that up, it should popup with a message to logout when youre done if it doesnt it didnt acknowledge request which is annoying
2008-08-07T17:48:00.000Z	CHR15	Pirate_Hunter	Uh?
2008-08-07T17:49:00.000Z	CHR15	Pirate_Hunter	I didn't do the second part, all I did was delete the xorg.conf files.
2008-08-07T17:51:00.000Z	CHR15	Pirate_Hunter	That command 'gksudo displayconfig' didn't work, nothing appeared.
2008-08-07T17:52:00.000Z	Pirate_Hunter	CHR15	sorry thought you wrote it down from before its gksudo displayconfig-gtk that will work now
2008-08-07T17:59:00.000Z	CHR15	Pirate_Hunter	I got this after the command DOL gave me, and then you soon after....http://pastebin.com/d79d9fd08
