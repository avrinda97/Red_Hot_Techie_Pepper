2005-12-31T17:44:00.000Z	Forza		roger
2005-12-31T06:18:00.000Z	Forza		I have a mp3 player that linux says is full when it in fact is empty, anyone know what to do?
2005-12-31T06:18:00.000Z	kemik	Forza	 make sure you dont have a .Trash in the root of the mp3player filesystem
2005-12-31T06:18:00.000Z	Forza	kemik	I have
2005-12-31T06:19:00.000Z	kemik	Forza	 and also make sure it's not root-mounted and youre trying to write as a user
2005-12-31T06:19:00.000Z	kemik	Forza	 delete the .Trash folder then
2005-12-31T06:19:00.000Z	kemik		the "trashcan-system" doesnt really work good with these USB devices
2005-12-31T06:20:00.000Z	Forza	kemik	i can't delete it
2005-12-31T06:20:00.000Z	kemik	Forza	 u probably need to be root :/
2005-12-31T06:20:00.000Z	kemik	Forza	 what's the err.msg ?
2005-12-31T06:21:00.000Z	Forza	kemik	that the fileending isn't supported
2005-12-31T06:22:00.000Z	kemik	Forza	 try from the CLI
2005-12-31T06:22:00.000Z	kemik	Forza	 or use windows if you gotit ;)
2005-12-31T06:23:00.000Z	Forza	kemik	no i dont have win but it seems just to be problems with linux so maybe i should switch back
2005-12-31T06:23:00.000Z	kemik	Forza	 well... dualboot is always an option
2005-12-31T06:24:00.000Z	kemik	Forza	 but using the CLI i'm sure you can delete the TRash-folder on your mp3player
2005-12-31T06:24:00.000Z	Forza	kemik	whats CLI?
2005-12-31T06:38:00.000Z	Forza	kemik	i have deleted the .Trash-1000 folder but it still says that the mp3 player is full when it isn't
