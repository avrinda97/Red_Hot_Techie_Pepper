2008-10-19T09:55:00.000Z	the_dude		hi, i cant boot from the cd to install ubuntu, i can only install inside windows...
2008-10-19T09:56:00.000Z	apathadeus	the_dude	why?
2008-10-19T09:56:00.000Z	the_dude	apathadeus	i try to boot and the screen says - please insert a CD
2008-10-19T09:57:00.000Z	apathadeus	the_dude	i see, i've never encountered that
2008-10-19T09:57:00.000Z	the_dude	apathadeus	yeah yeah, ill see that...
2008-10-19T09:57:00.000Z	the_dude	apathadeus	i can live with that hehehe
2008-10-19T09:57:00.000Z	apathadeus	the_dude	do you have multiple cd drives?
2008-10-19T09:58:00.000Z	the_dude	apathadeus	man do you know how do i format only the ubuntu partition
2008-10-19T09:58:00.000Z	the_dude	apathadeus	yes, a dvd and a cd driver
2008-10-19T09:58:00.000Z	apathadeus	the_dude	i think that MAY be the cause
2008-10-19T09:58:00.000Z	apathadeus	the_dude	the ubuntu cd has a partitioner inside, or you can use magic partition in windows
2008-10-19T09:58:00.000Z	the_dude	apathadeus	yeh maybe, and the cd has an option, Help to Boot...
2008-10-19T09:59:00.000Z	the_dude	apathadeus	i install and then he misses one file
2008-10-19T09:59:00.000Z	the_dude	apathadeus	yeah man im on ubuntu, i got it from install inside windows, and i chose the other partition
2008-10-19T10:00:00.000Z	apathadeus	the_dude	i've never used the boot-from-windows feature. I think if you install it from windows, you can't install it as a partition. at least I haven't figured that out
2008-10-19T10:01:00.000Z	the_dude		man, i got 2 partition, 1 with xp, and the other empty, got it? when i installed ubuntu, i chose the empty one ;)

2008-10-19T10:03:00.000Z	apathadeus	the_dude	i don't know about installing from windows, i thought it only installed the emulated version of ubuntu
