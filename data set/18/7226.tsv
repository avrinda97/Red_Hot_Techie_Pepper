2009-11-16T09:49:00.000Z	sebsebseb	jbuncher	well I don't need Karmic to fix any hardware :)  as for later versions of programs well ppa's or compile from source or whatever
2009-11-16T09:49:00.000Z	sebsebseb	jbuncher	and those Intel issues could have been fixed in Jauntey I expect  and with the fixes coming from the default repos, if  they didn't only provide security updates from them
2009-11-16T09:50:00.000Z	jbuncher	sebsebseb	yeah, but I hate going outside the repos for things, seems to defeat the purpose unless you limit it to a very small number of apps (something like skype and such).  They could have been, and I mucked with the xorg and got them *pretty* much resolved, but it still wasn't good enough.  The main thing that killed Jaunty for me was the kile/okular situation and the lack of kde3 libs.
2009-11-16T09:52:00.000Z	sebsebseb	jbuncher	latex  stuff I don't really know about that, but by the way there's a Kubuntu KDE 3  Remix CD for  jaunty  karmic and I think maybe 8.10 as well,  plus a ppa that can be installed
2009-11-16T09:53:00.000Z	sebsebseb	jbuncher	KDE 3 ppa being for each version, not the same ppa for those three, or whatever
2009-11-16T09:53:00.000Z	jbuncher	sebsebseb	I'm mostly a gnome user, but kile is the one kde program I use heavily, so I didn't want an entire remix or ppa for one program and such.  At any rate, everything is working well for me in Karmic, so all is good :)
2009-11-16T09:54:00.000Z	sebsebseb	jbuncher	same here mainly a Gnome user, but I run some KDE apps in it here and there,  well  Konversation has been my IRC client for months now,  I guess more like two years or so
2009-11-16T09:55:00.000Z	jbuncher	sebsebseb	I just use xchat.  I'm trying to think of other kde apps I use, and I think kopete is the only one, in the rare cases I need to use a webcam with someone on yahoo.
2009-11-16T09:55:00.000Z	sebsebseb	jbuncher	that annoys me to some extent how  most  Ubuntu users use Xchat,  when there are other rather good IRC clients  as well such as Konversation or IRSSI even after configuring
2009-11-16T09:56:00.000Z	jbuncher	sebsebseb	why does it annoy you?  I find xchat to be pretty good.  I like it better than gnome-xchat or xchat-gnome or whatever it's called.
2009-11-16T09:57:00.000Z	sebsebseb	jbuncher	most Ubuntu users that use  the IRC I should say.  well yeah  it's meant to be better than that one, but  try some other clients :)
2009-11-16T09:57:00.000Z	sebsebseb	jbuncher	oh yeah we are off topic really, but  no  o  p s  or  whatever telling us off
2009-11-16T09:58:00.000Z	jbuncher	sebsebseb	well then I'll turn it into a support question.  I'm looking for a better client than xchat, but don't want a kde one.  What would you suggest and why?
2009-11-16T09:58:00.000Z	sebsebseb	jbuncher	irssi then and  people tend to use that with a program called screen
2009-11-16T09:59:00.000Z	jbuncher	sebsebseb	now I just need the "why" :)
2009-11-16T09:59:00.000Z	sebsebseb	jbuncher	why, becasue that's all quite popular well with  experienced  Desktop Linux users,  and it runs in the shell (terminal, konsole if you like even) and so that's good,  and after customizing it it can do a lot
2009-11-16T10:01:00.000Z	jbuncher	sebsebseb	I'll keep that in mind.  I don't really want to run IRC in a terminal, but that could definitely come in handy if X gets hosed.  I'll be staying away from Konversation, if only because I can't stand the "K" naming in KDE.
2009-11-16T10:01:00.000Z	sebsebseb	jbuncher	and your not exactly a newbie if you  use IRSSI,  and I like to joke about xchat sometimes, because most of the new  Ubuntu users that use IRC use it  as well as  a lot of more experienced ones.   anyway as a joke I like to sometimes call it noobchat for this very reason
