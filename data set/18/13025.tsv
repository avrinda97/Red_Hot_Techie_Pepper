2006-01-23T13:56:00.000Z	cheloo		hi all
2006-01-23T13:58:00.000Z	cheloo		what would be best to use , if i want to start a mail server under ubuntu ? qmail ? postfix with courier imap + mysql ? what do you guys suggest ?
2006-01-23T13:58:00.000Z	dannym	cheloo	that's a really really subjective question ;)
2006-01-23T13:59:00.000Z	cheloo	dannym	 well its just like " what would run better with ubuntu " ? its the fisrt time i run ubuntu and aint got a clue
2006-01-23T13:59:00.000Z	cheloo	dannym	 i would like to use qmail in fedora . and postfix in debian , what would be for ubuntu ? :)) what its the most ...
2006-01-23T14:01:00.000Z	dannym	cheloo	it auto-installed postfix for me and I was too lazy so far to switch to qmail :)
2006-01-23T14:01:00.000Z	cheloo	dannym	well only postfix doesnt mean you are running a " mail server "
2006-01-23T14:07:00.000Z	dannym	cheloo	actually it does, when running postfix and entering an MX record in your dns, you are by definition running a mail server (MTA) ;)
2006-01-23T14:08:00.000Z	cheloo	dannym	 well i want something diff. i want to be able to add users to mysql . i also want to have a webmail interface . :)
2006-01-23T14:09:00.000Z	dannym	cheloo	for webmail, I liked omail (with small fixes) (though that's for qmail)
2006-01-23T14:10:00.000Z	cheloo	dannym	 omail  its for qmail ?
2006-01-23T14:10:00.000Z	dannym	cheloo	yes, webmail and web admin tool for qmail
2006-01-23T14:33:00.000Z	dannym	cheloo	probably a bug, or at least almost :)
2006-01-23T14:33:00.000Z	dannym	cheloo	(I'd report it)
2006-01-23T14:35:00.000Z	cheloo	dannym	so what is it ?
2006-01-23T14:35:00.000Z	dannym	cheloo	bug
2006-01-23T14:36:00.000Z	dannym	cheloo	maybe it shuts up when it finds any other mail delivery agent, try installing another first ?
