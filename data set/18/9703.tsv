2007-03-30T16:42:00.000Z	LordLimecat		firestarter is NOT a firewall, but a gui to ubuntus built in firewall...right?
2007-03-30T16:42:00.000Z	lufis	LordLimecat	yes
2007-03-30T16:43:00.000Z	lufis	LordLimecat	basically, yes
2007-03-30T16:44:00.000Z	lufis	LordLimecat	Firestarter lets you edit what is already a firewalled configuration pretty much
2007-04-21T07:51:00.000Z	lufis	LordLimecat	just gnu?
2007-04-21T07:51:00.000Z	LordLimecat	lufis	if yes
2007-04-21T07:51:00.000Z	lufis	LordLimecat	"You need GNU to make this app"?
2007-04-21T07:52:00.000Z	LordLimecat	lufis	i am possibly an idiot....it says "you need to use GNU make"
2007-04-21T07:52:00.000Z	LordLimecat	lufis	but when i use make, it throws a fit
2007-04-21T07:52:00.000Z	lufis	LordLimecat	ah, do you have build-essential installed?
2007-04-21T07:59:00.000Z	lufis	LordLimecat	Have you got all the dependencies installed?
2007-04-21T08:00:00.000Z	lufis	LordLimecat	what are you compiling again?
2007-04-21T08:01:00.000Z	LordLimecat	lufis	im at that stage where im trying to get used to building programs myself, but still sort of confused
2007-04-21T08:01:00.000Z	lufis	LordLimecat	ah, thats ok... it's a simple process once you get the hang of it, especially with ubuntu's awesome repos
2007-04-21T08:03:00.000Z	lufis	LordLimecat	Hm... have you looked in the readme for any?
2007-04-21T08:03:00.000Z	lufis	LordLimecat	generally the devs list them
2007-04-21T08:03:00.000Z	LordLimecat	lufis	ill check again....do i need gcc?
2007-04-21T08:03:00.000Z	lufis	LordLimecat	yes, but it's included in the build-essential metapackage
