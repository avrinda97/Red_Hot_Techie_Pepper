2007-05-20T14:57:00.000Z	AFaith		oh...
2007-05-20T14:57:00.000Z	AFaith		ok .. let me tell you the problem again
2007-05-20T14:58:00.000Z	bulmer		also learn to prefix a nick so it would not be missed
2007-05-20T14:58:00.000Z	AFaith		i've misstyped and i've created a symlink and i've replaced /etc/rc.d  with a symlink to /opt/lampp/lampp
2007-05-20T14:58:00.000Z	AFaith	bulmer	how do i do that ?
2007-05-20T14:58:00.000Z	bulmer	AFaith	do which? put a nick on the front of your message?
2007-05-20T14:59:00.000Z	AFaith		oh :P i will ...
2007-05-20T14:59:00.000Z	bulmer	AFaith	symlinks can be erased
2007-05-20T14:59:00.000Z	AFaith	bulmer	but if i'm erasing /etc/rc.d symlink it will remain a directory ?
2007-05-20T14:59:00.000Z	AFaith		the original directory ?
2007-05-20T15:00:00.000Z	bulmer	AFaith	its easy to recreate a directory, for one, if you created a symlink using an existing name, it will not be created anyways
2007-05-20T15:01:00.000Z	AFaith	bulmer	are you telling me that i cannot restore /etc/rc.d ? and if so, if i reboot my pc, it will have problems or just boot normally ?
2007-05-20T15:02:00.000Z	bulmer	AFaith	i dont think /etc/rc.d is as important as /etc/init.d  but hang on..let me compare to my Dapper
2007-05-20T15:02:00.000Z	AFaith		ok ...
2007-05-20T15:03:00.000Z	bulmer	AFaith	/etc/rc.d does not even exist on mine..only /etc/init.d
