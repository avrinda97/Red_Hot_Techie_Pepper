2005-02-11T11:15:00.000Z	Agrajag		We COULD tell him to fuck off and get help elsewhere
2005-02-11T11:15:00.000Z	Agrajag		would that be in the whole ubuntu spirit I hear so much about?
2005-02-11T11:15:00.000Z	Agrajag		I don't use winiso, so I can't.
2005-02-11T11:15:00.000Z	Agrajag		there is a windows frontend for cdrecord...
2005-02-11T11:16:00.000Z	Agrajag		let me look
2005-02-11T11:16:00.000Z	Agrajag		and they could help.
2005-02-11T11:16:00.000Z	Agrajag		So asking a simple question shouldn't get a response like "oh, nobody here uses that, that's not linux, that's offtopic
2005-02-11T11:17:00.000Z	Agrajag		goddamnit, stop talking to me and let me look!
2005-02-11T11:18:00.000Z	Agrajag		or I could put you on ignore

2005-07-25T08:36:00.000Z	tritium	Agrajag	this is hoary
2005-07-25T08:37:00.000Z	tritium	Agrajag	it's not spatial
