2009-11-06T08:41:00.000Z	droid7	Amaranth	not douting you, but how come the problem exists only with compiz on?
2009-11-06T08:42:00.000Z	Amaranth	droid7	Some people get the problem with metacity, some get it with other WMs
2009-11-06T08:42:00.000Z	droid7	Amaranth	nevermind, it can still be a gtk issue. Excuse my liquored state of mind :)
2009-11-06T08:42:00.000Z	Amaranth	droid7	Some also don't get it with other browsers
2009-11-06T08:43:00.000Z	droid7	Amaranth	It's on and off for me. I can click on flash in some areas (for ex. grooveshark.com) but youtube pause+play is tricky
2009-11-06T08:43:00.000Z	Amaranth	droid7	If you're using 64-bit firefox and 32-bit flash there is a workaround
2009-11-06T08:43:00.000Z	droid7	Amaranth	nope, 32bit, but i'll be patient with a fix; unless there is one already
2009-11-06T08:43:00.000Z	Amaranth	droid7	hmm, with 32-bit it should only happen with chromium
2009-11-06T08:44:00.000Z	droid7	Amaranth	haha, damn you hit the spot
2009-11-06T08:44:00.000Z	droid7	Amaranth	I'ma try firefox
2009-11-06T08:44:00.000Z	droid7	Amaranth	Although, the issue sometimes happens with Opera as well
2009-11-06T08:44:00.000Z	Amaranth	droid7	Yeah, I don't know of a fix for chromium but it uses the same technique as nspluginwrapper so it has the same problem
2009-11-06T08:45:00.000Z	droid7	Amaranth	Yes, firefox seems to be OK. Thanks for the heads up :D
2009-11-06T08:45:00.000Z	Amaranth	droid7	no problem, it's either a regression in GTK+ caused by the massive internal changes made or a bug in flash that was masked before
2009-11-06T08:45:00.000Z	droid7	Amaranth	knowing flash... :p
2009-11-06T08:45:00.000Z	Amaranth	droid7	I could get into the details of passive X input grabs and such but it gives me enough of a headache I don't want to torture you :)
2009-11-06T08:46:00.000Z	droid7	Amaranth	I'll stay by your best interest for now hehe
2009-11-06T08:46:00.000Z	droid7	Amaranth	As a side note: thanks for the work you've done :D
