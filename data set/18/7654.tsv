2008-06-25T17:41:00.000Z	berzerka		how do i proceed if i want to install ubuntu's kernel by hand? i installed linux-sources, configured and built them, now what? something special? just make modules_install and copy the bzImage? how do i deal with the initrd?
2008-06-25T17:41:00.000Z	maek	berzerka	just use the default kernel
2008-06-25T17:56:00.000Z	berzerka	maek	ikonia: i can imagine a variety of reasons not to use the default kernel. in this case i want to enable usb verbose debugging support.
2008-06-25T17:57:00.000Z	maek	berzerka	if you need usb verbose debugging support then you are a developer and this is an inappropriate channel to ask that sort of question
2008-06-25T17:58:00.000Z	berzerka	maek	i am a software developer, not an ubuntu developer.. where shall i ask the question. regarding ubuntu, i consider myself a "user".
2008-06-25T18:10:00.000Z	maek	berzerka	if you are a software developer there are better places to get help rather than the general ubuntu chat channel
2008-06-25T18:10:00.000Z	berzerka	maek	regarding ubuntu usage?
2008-06-25T18:11:00.000Z	maek	berzerka	you should have support packages in place at your enterprise for technical support
2008-06-25T18:12:00.000Z	berzerka	maek	^
2008-06-25T18:12:00.000Z	maek	berzerka	there are great Companies that specialize in Linux support and they have quite reasonable fees
2008-06-25T18:12:00.000Z	maek	berzerka	but again where you get enterprise support is off topic for this channel
2008-06-25T18:13:00.000Z	berzerka	maek	alright, lets stop this.
2008-06-25T18:18:00.000Z	maek	berzerka	you come in here for enterprise level support to further yourself financially .. unless you are a open source developer .. but then if you are a OS dev then you would know where to get support
2008-06-25T18:19:00.000Z	berzerka	maek	what are you talking about? i am an university student trying to implement a userspace USB device driver on a ubuntu system!
2008-06-25T18:20:00.000Z	berzerka	maek	what is this "enterprise" you are constantly talking about? canonical?
2008-06-25T18:47:00.000Z	maek	berzerka	cause I can't send PMs ... nothing to do with me not "being interested"
2008-06-25T18:48:00.000Z	berzerka	maek	alright, i saw it. just wanted to say we're at ease mate. (at least regarding me..)
2008-06-25T18:49:00.000Z	berzerka	maek	(and aside, i got "[15:46] <maek> cause I can't send PMS" from you as a personal message..)
