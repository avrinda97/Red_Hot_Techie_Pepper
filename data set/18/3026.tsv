2009-12-29T19:34:00.000Z	SomeSome	ActionParsnip	I'm Someoneis. I'm back and I don't have enough disc space to back stuff up on another partition.
2009-12-29T19:35:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	SomeSome	then what if the drive motor dies and the data is irretrievable. where is your data?
2009-12-29T19:36:00.000Z	SomeSome	ActionParsnip	I can access the data with the live CD. Is there any way I can transfer it to my other computer?
2009-12-29T19:36:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	SomeSome	no backup == data is disposable and unimportant
2009-12-29T19:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	SomeSome	sure you can mount the partition(s) under the livecd and use nautilus to access the shares on another system
2009-12-29T19:37:00.000Z	SomeSome	ActionParsnip	How can I do such a thing?
2009-12-29T19:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	SomeSome	you will need to share a folder on another system to spit the file to
2009-12-29T19:37:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	SomeSome	it willhave an entry under places
2009-12-29T19:38:00.000Z	SomeSome	ActionParsnip	May you lead me in the right direction for sharing files between ubuntu and windows?
2009-12-29T19:39:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	SomeSome	windows can share folders already, setting that up is as simple as rihtclicking a folder, you can then (in nautilus) type:    smb://wndowshostname/sharename
2009-12-29T19:39:00.000Z	SomeSome	ActionParsnip	I know how to do it on windows but I don't know how to do it on ubuntu.
2009-12-29T19:40:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	SomeSome	you dont have to in ubuntu, you can simply access the share as I said above
2009-12-29T19:41:00.000Z	SomeSome	ActionParsnip	Is it set up automatically for the LAN network?
2009-12-29T19:41:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	SomeSome	if the nic is detected it will auto use dhcp by default
2009-12-29T19:42:00.000Z	SomeSome	ActionParsnip	I didn't think it would be that simple, I will give it a go and let you know how it goes.
2009-12-29T19:42:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	SomeSome	its as easy as windows. why did you think it would be hard?
2009-12-29T19:43:00.000Z	SomeSome	ActionParsnip	Things I have done in the past for ubuntu wasn't as easy. But then again, I'm just novice for ubuntu.
2009-12-29T19:44:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	SomeSome	probably due to microsoft over use, ubuntu is slightly different but can work just as easily with use
