2005-11-17T14:13:00.000Z	sinizzl		how can i install gcc-3.4.4 on ubuntu without using the sources from the gnu.org mirrors ?
2005-11-17T14:13:00.000Z	sinizzl		is there anythign like apt-get install gcc-3.4.4 (that one doesn't work) ?
2005-11-17T14:13:00.000Z	tritium	sinizzl	the package is gcc-3.4
2005-11-17T14:14:00.000Z	sinizzl	tritium	thank you, that one DOES work.
2005-11-17T14:14:00.000Z	tritium	sinizzl	well, I wouldn't tell you if it didn't ;)
2005-11-17T14:14:00.000Z	sinizzl	tritium	wow, that's soooo awesome, you're my hero ;-)
2005-11-17T14:14:00.000Z	tritium	sinizzl	do you have build-essential installed?
2005-11-17T14:15:00.000Z	tritium	sinizzl	it's a meta-package that depends on a lot of commonly used development packages such as gcc, make, etc...
2005-11-17T14:15:00.000Z	sinizzl	tritium	yeah, i think this would be quite utile, thanks again
2005-11-17T14:17:00.000Z	tritium	sinizzl	I'm glad it helped :)
2005-11-17T14:18:00.000Z	sinizzl	tritium	don't you know anything about language settings ?
2005-11-17T14:18:00.000Z	tritium	sinizzl	what do you mean?
2005-11-17T14:19:00.000Z	tritium	sinizzl	oh, sorry, I've never tried any other language other than Enlish.  Sorry that I can't help with that...
2005-11-17T14:19:00.000Z	sinizzl	tritium	is it possible that i have to install something like "nautilus-some-gemran-version.deb"
2005-11-17T14:19:00.000Z	tritium	sinizzl	it should depend on your locales setting, I would think
2005-11-17T14:20:00.000Z	tritium	sinizzl	you can try sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales
2005-11-17T14:36:00.000Z	tritium	sinizzl	there are various packages.  use apt-cache search wxwindows to find them
