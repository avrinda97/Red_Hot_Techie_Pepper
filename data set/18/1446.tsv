2011-02-23T10:05:00.000Z	Senjai		Hey guys, does anyone know how to mount a remote filesystem?
2011-02-23T10:05:00.000Z	Senjai		e.g. is there a way to mount my uni's filesystem onto a folder locally.
2011-02-23T10:07:00.000Z	sxndave	Senjai	In nautilus, select 'File > conect to server...'. There are several options of how to do it. You will either need to have ssh access to the remote machine and use that account of ftp access to it.
2011-02-23T10:08:00.000Z	Senjai	sxndave	i have ssh access, is there a command line varient to do it though? I'm aware of the GUI version (perhaps I should have stated so)
2011-02-23T10:09:00.000Z	Senjai	sxndave	and I believe that the GUI version uses sftp, which my uni allows.
2011-02-23T10:10:00.000Z	sxndave	Senjai	I guess there is but I dont't know it unfortunately, and yeh it can use sftp or ftp in the nautilus method
2011-02-23T10:10:00.000Z	Senjai	sxndave	yea... neither do I
2011-02-23T10:10:00.000Z	sxndave	Senjai	Im interested to know myself how to do it from the command line. It would be nice to be able to put a bash script together to mount my remote systems at startup
2011-02-23T10:11:00.000Z	Senjai	sxndave	sftp uses ssh protocol, ftp uses.. ftp protocol.
2011-02-23T10:11:00.000Z	Senjai	sxndave	that's what I'm trying to do
2011-02-23T10:12:00.000Z	sxndave	Senjai	yes and you can choose to use either when connecting via nautilus. I would use sftp from the cli though in order to be able to authenticate using keys instead of putting the password in the script
2011-02-23T10:13:00.000Z	Senjai	sxndave	I'd either prompt for a password on startup, or make it so the script cant be read by anyone except me
2011-02-23T10:20:00.000Z	sxndave	Senjai	check out the package 'sshfs'
2011-02-23T10:20:00.000Z	Senjai	sxndave	it wants its own usergroup, It doesn't have to be done that way
2011-02-23T10:20:00.000Z	Senjai	sxndave	if Ubuntu can already do it via the GUI, there has to be a way to do it via the command line
2011-02-23T10:21:00.000Z	Senjai	sxndave	and I have no intention of creating a user in which the application has full rights to
2011-02-23T10:22:00.000Z	sxndave	Senjai	I wouldnt either, but im inclined to think that that functionality is either part of nautilus or gnome as I could not do it in xubuntu without installing nautilus and fudging it to be the default file manager with a link
2011-02-23T10:23:00.000Z	Senjai	sxndave	I can map network filesystems, but I cant mount remote filesystems that require authentication.
