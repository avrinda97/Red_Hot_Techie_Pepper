2008-04-26T06:24:00.000Z	isdepopecath	Pelo	(I was the newbie trying to access my vista partition) I installed the NFTS Configuration Tool, but it isn't recognizing any more partitions, unless I don't know where to go to see that. Any ideas?
2008-04-26T06:25:00.000Z	Pelo	isdepopecath	ntfs partitons in gusty and above should be detected automaticaly and mounted read only , didnT' it do that ?
2008-04-26T06:26:00.000Z	isdepopecath	Pelo	No, they did not. They did when I was just using the Live CD, but now that I've installed, I can't find them
2008-04-26T06:26:00.000Z	Pelo	isdepopecath	look in thye top panel in places , see them there ?
2008-04-26T06:27:00.000Z	isdepopecath	Pelo	It shows 'Computer,' but if I go into that, it only shows up with my dvd drive and 'File System'
2008-04-26T06:28:00.000Z	Pelo	isdepopecath	right click , mount ,  see if they show up on your desktop
2008-04-26T06:31:00.000Z	isdepopecath	Pelo	What should I right click on?
2008-04-26T06:32:00.000Z	Pelo	isdepopecath	the icon for your ntfs partion in my computer
2008-04-26T06:33:00.000Z	isdepopecath	Pelo	There is no icon for NFTS partition in my computer
2008-04-26T06:34:00.000Z	Pelo	isdepopecath	I thought you said you saw your windows vista hard drive in my computer ?
2008-04-26T06:35:00.000Z	Pelo	isdepopecath	ok try this open a terminal , in applicaiton > accessories ,    type   sudo apt-get install gparted && sudo gparted,  this wil open the partiton manager,  see if your partitons are visible in there
2008-04-26T06:40:00.000Z	isdepopecath	Pelo	It wants me to type in a password in my terminal after I've entered that command, but then it won't actually type anything when I press keys.
2008-04-26T06:40:00.000Z	Pelo	isdepopecath	that,S normal , it's to hide the password from ppl looking over your shoulder
2008-04-26T06:41:00.000Z	isdepopecath	Pelo	It says waiting for headers...so now I just wait?
2008-04-26T06:43:00.000Z	Pelo	isdepopecath	patience,  the servers very loaded , might take a few minutes to dl and install , the command i gave you will open the app automaticaly when it is installed
2008-04-26T06:43:00.000Z	isdepopecath	Pelo	Thanks so much!
2008-04-26T06:44:00.000Z	Pelo	isdepopecath	no promisses yet,    M$ does not play well with others and Vista is their latest attempt at bullying other OSes from the computers,  might not work
2008-04-26T06:44:00.000Z	isdepopecath	Pelo	Ok, no worries.
