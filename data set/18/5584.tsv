2008-09-22T15:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dkjahjkajfhs	try a bios update, you wont be able to boot from usb if your bios doesnt support it
2008-09-22T15:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dkjahjkajfhs	you could boot from floppy disk to bootstrap the usb to boot
2008-09-22T15:50:00.000Z	dkjahjkajfhs	ActionParsnip	i don't want to use floppy disk :C i'll try to update my BIOS
2008-09-22T15:51:00.000Z	dkjahjkajfhs	ActionParsnip	thanks
2008-09-22T15:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dkjahjkajfhs	if you cant boot from bios, ten you'll have to
2008-09-22T15:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dkjahjkajfhs	its just to load the bootloader, aftr that its usb drive all the way
2008-09-22T15:52:00.000Z	dkjahjkajfhs	ActionParsnip	ya, but will i have to do this every time?
2008-09-22T15:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dkjahjkajfhs	yes everytime you boot
2008-09-22T15:52:00.000Z	dkjahjkajfhs	ActionParsnip	:(
2008-09-22T15:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dkjahjkajfhs	its your hardware limiting you
2008-09-22T15:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dkjahjkajfhs	not all boards support usb booting
2008-09-22T15:53:00.000Z	dkjahjkajfhs	ActionParsnip	ya, my laptop is old one :}
2008-09-22T15:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dkjahjkajfhs	thats why

2008-09-22T15:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dkjahjkajfhs	they may have kicked out a bios that does, if not its floppy for you
2008-09-22T15:54:00.000Z	dkjahjkajfhs	ActionParsnip	okay, but first i'll try to upgrade my bios and if that did't work i'll use the fdd
2008-09-22T15:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	dkjahjkajfhs	make sure its the right bios or your system will never boot
