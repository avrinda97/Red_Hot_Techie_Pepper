2007-08-16T15:05:00.000Z	bern		hey, anyone know why my restricted drivers arent installing?
2007-08-16T15:05:00.000Z	wolferine	bern	what type of video card?
2007-08-16T15:06:00.000Z	bern	wolferine	its an nvidia geforce 5 series
2007-08-16T15:06:00.000Z	wolferine	bern	so your using the 'nvidia' driver I hope, if all goes well, is it a single monitor?
2007-08-16T15:06:00.000Z	bern	wolferine	yes its my laptop. i just installed ubuntu on it
2007-08-16T15:07:00.000Z	wolferine	bern	do not use envy, please
2007-08-16T15:07:00.000Z	wolferine	bern	can you confirm that the 'nvidia' driver is being used, sudo nano /etc/X11/xorg.conf
2007-08-16T15:07:00.000Z	bern	wolferine	what do you suggest i do?
2007-08-16T15:10:00.000Z	bern	wolferine	how do i tell? i dont know what to look for in xorg.conf..
2007-08-16T15:12:00.000Z	wolferine	bern	look for the word driver?
2007-08-16T15:12:00.000Z	bern	wolferine	under the "Device" section.. it says Driver: "nv"
2007-08-16T15:12:00.000Z	wolferine	bern	so the restricted drivers may have installed, but you need to allow the xorg.conf to use the 'nvidia' driver
2007-08-16T15:13:00.000Z	bern	wolferine	so i change it from "nv" to "nvidia"/
2007-08-16T15:13:00.000Z	wolferine	bern	well, if you X fails on reboot ( u will have to restart X for the xorg.conf to take), you will need to change it back to nv, but yes, try using nvidia
2007-08-16T15:14:00.000Z	wolferine	bern	press ctrl-alt-backspace to restart X
2007-08-16T15:14:00.000Z	bern	wolferine	alright.. and if nothing works then.. then what should i do?
2007-08-16T15:15:00.000Z	wolferine	bern	I explained that already
2007-08-16T15:16:00.000Z	wolferine	bern	seems your seeking help elsewhere, good luck
