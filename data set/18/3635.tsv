2009-08-29T20:21:00.000Z	Dartagon		Hey guys-- I'm trying to log into my wireless network--- but tying in the correct key the "connect" button is greyed out
2009-08-29T20:21:00.000Z	Dartagon		guys how do I force the connection?
2009-08-29T20:21:00.000Z	Dartagon		The key is correct I just need to "connect" button to not be greyed (which is ridiculous that it's greyed out at all)
2009-08-29T20:21:00.000Z	ubuntu_606_upgra	Dartagon	sudo iwconfig essid NAMEOFNETWORK wep KEY
2009-08-29T20:22:00.000Z	ubuntu_606_upgra	Dartagon	you can man iwconfig or iwconfig --help for more details as well
2009-08-29T20:22:00.000Z	Dartagon	ubuntu_606_upgra	Ahh try this in terminal?
2009-08-29T20:22:00.000Z	ubuntu_606_upgra	Dartagon	yes, its encryption KEY though, but yes
2009-08-29T20:23:00.000Z	ubuntu_606_upgra		anyone know how to force https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HardyUpgrades Step #5 from 6.06 to 8.04 since its not appearing as stated?
2009-08-29T20:23:00.000Z	Dartagon	ubuntu_606_upgra	Just for clarification its-- sudo iwconfig essid [NETWORK NAME] wep [KEY]
2009-08-29T20:23:00.000Z	ubuntu_606_upgra	Dartagon	yes, thanks for the italicise
2009-08-29T20:24:00.000Z	ubuntu_606_upgra	Dartagon	but its encryption instead of wep
2009-08-29T20:24:00.000Z	ubuntu_606_upgra	Dartagon	doing a man iwconfig (q to quit) and iwconfig --help gives you more connection options
2009-08-29T20:25:00.000Z	ubuntu_606_upgra		anyone know how to force https://help.ubuntu.com/community/HardyUpgrades Step #5 from 6.06 to 8.04 since its not appearing as stated?
2009-08-29T20:26:00.000Z	Dartagon	ubuntu_606_upgra	Hmmm strange it came out "unknown command "networkname""
2009-08-29T20:26:00.000Z	ubuntu_606_upgra	Dartagon	you replace your network name with networkname
2009-08-29T20:26:00.000Z	Dartagon		of course
2009-08-29T20:27:00.000Z	Dartagon		sudo iwconfig essid [network name] wep [encryption code]
2009-08-29T20:27:00.000Z	ubuntu_606_upgra	Dartagon	change wep to encryption, but all else looks good (to check try iwconfig --help)
