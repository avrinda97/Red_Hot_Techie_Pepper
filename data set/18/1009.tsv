2011-07-23T05:06:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	OogyPoogy	To restart samba, /etc/init.d/smbd restart
2011-07-23T05:06:00.000Z	OogyPoogy	YankDownUnder	thanks! Very much appreciate the help here!

2011-07-23T05:17:00.000Z	OogyPoogy	YankDownUnder	how come everyone hates the traditional menu so much? :)
2011-07-23T05:18:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	OogyPoogy	They don't hate it, they "decided via corporate thought" that it was no longer important - that goes for the Unity team and the Gnome3 team. They're trying to emulate the "smartphone" and "netbook" mentality.
2011-07-23T05:19:00.000Z	OogyPoogy	YankDownUnder	but I don't get it. What if you don't use a touchscreen device?
2011-07-23T05:21:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	OogyPoogy	Well, the apparent corporate paradigm is more important than what YOU think. Apparently.
2011-07-23T05:27:00.000Z	OogyPoogy	YankDownUnder	You've been down under too long. Not all of us are thick :)
2011-07-23T05:27:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	OogyPoogy	Spot on.
2011-07-23T05:28:00.000Z	YankDownUnder	OogyPoogy	;)
