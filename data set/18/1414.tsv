2011-05-23T01:35:00.000Z	foot-odor		anyone here use ubuntu?
2011-05-23T01:36:00.000Z	foot-odor		sorry about the trolling :P
2011-05-23T01:36:00.000Z	foot-odor		but i do have a grub question
2011-05-23T01:37:00.000Z	foot-odor		and since ubuntu uses grub
2011-05-23T01:37:00.000Z	foot-odor		is it a apropiate palce to ask?
2011-05-23T01:37:00.000Z	LjL	foot-odor	appropriate enough if you're using Ubuntu
2011-05-23T01:37:00.000Z	foot-odor		can i install grub before installing any os ?
2011-05-23T01:37:00.000Z	foot-odor		sure
2011-05-23T01:38:00.000Z	LjL	foot-odor	well yes you can but it's probably easier to install it together with an OS
2011-05-23T01:38:00.000Z	LjL	foot-odor	actually wait, i'm not sure you can
2011-05-23T01:38:00.000Z	LjL	foot-odor	GRUB does afaik need a partition to store its cruft on
2011-05-23T01:39:00.000Z	foot-odor	LjL	escott i want to format my hdd
2011-05-23T01:39:00.000Z	foot-odor		and create the boot partition first
2011-05-23T01:40:00.000Z	foot-odor		then install the os'es one by one
2011-05-23T01:40:00.000Z	foot-odor		well none of my os'es has grub integrated
2011-05-23T01:40:00.000Z	foot-odor		that's the point
2011-05-23T01:40:00.000Z	LjL	foot-odor	you can do that, create a boot partition and install GRUB on it... but for that matter you can pick one OS (say Ubuntu) and install it while telling it to create a /boot partition, and that seems easier, so i'm not sure why you'd want to do that
