2009-12-01T04:44:00.000Z	jcp		how do i redirect both stdout and stderr to a file?
2009-12-01T04:44:00.000Z	jcp		without overwriting the file
2009-12-01T04:45:00.000Z	jcp		i want to write to the end of the file, not overwrite the file
2009-12-01T04:45:00.000Z	jcp		script &>> file ?
2009-12-01T04:46:00.000Z	jrib	jcp	why not just try what you said? :)  (it works on zsh, probably the same on bash)
2009-12-01T04:47:00.000Z	jcp	jrib	i wasnt sure if that would work, i was asking, but i'll do that
2009-12-01T04:47:00.000Z	jrib	jcp	you try with a test command and file of course
2009-12-01T05:15:00.000Z	jrib	jcp	and?
2009-12-01T05:16:00.000Z	jrib	jcp	you should create a bash script and just run that.  I bet crontab gets interpreted through sh
2009-12-01T05:19:00.000Z	jrib	jcp	just check for mail from cron
2009-12-01T05:22:00.000Z	jcp	jrib	see this is the problem, i see no signs of errors anywhere. no mail from cron, nothing in the log, but its clear the scripts i have in the crontab are not being run
2009-12-01T05:22:00.000Z	jrib	jcp	desktop ubuntu doesn't install an mta by default, did you install one?
2009-12-01T05:23:00.000Z	jcp	jrib	that could be the problem, im going to look into that now
2009-12-01T05:23:00.000Z	jrib	jcp	debian uses exim by default which I like, but there are lighter ones too
2009-12-01T05:29:00.000Z	jcp	jrib	what kind of configuration is needed once i've got sendmail installed?
2009-12-01T05:29:00.000Z	jrib	jcp	I don't think I've ever installed sendmail, but usually it should just work for local mail (exim asks you using debconf)
2009-12-01T05:34:00.000Z	jrib	jcp	I doubt it
2010-01-06T00:38:00.000Z	jrib	jcp	set the DISPLAY environment variable, e.g. DISPLAY=:0 firefox
