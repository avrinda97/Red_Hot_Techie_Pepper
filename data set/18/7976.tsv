2008-03-12T01:57:00.000Z	bastid_raZor		norty; that would get around the blockage if your school is blocking port 22.. which i would think they are.
2008-03-12T01:57:00.000Z	bastid_raZor		norty; what type of router do you have?
2008-03-12T01:58:00.000Z	zcat[1]	bastid_raZor	most schools forward www through a proxy (and dansdguardian) and block everything else..
2008-03-12T02:03:00.000Z	zcat[1]	bastid_raZor	I saw once a technique to tunnel IP through DNS requests .. not very efficient, but very good at getting around firewalls :)
2008-03-12T02:25:00.000Z	zcat[1]	bastid_raZor	my wife is used to ubuntu now and hates windows (and she hasn't even seen vista yet :)
2008-03-12T02:35:00.000Z	zcat[1]	bastid_raZor	both ends are behind NAT and he doesn't know how to forward ports...
2008-03-12T02:42:00.000Z	zcat[1]	bastid_raZor	not at all, they can just use winscp from the windows end, drag and drop the file..
2008-03-12T02:42:00.000Z	zcat[1]	bastid_raZor	only one end needs to figure out port forwarding
2008-03-12T02:44:00.000Z	zcat[1]	bastid_raZor	filezilla can do scp?
2008-03-12T02:46:00.000Z	zcat[1]	bastid_raZor	just that ftp is more complex than scp.. passive vs active mode, etc..
2008-03-12T02:57:00.000Z	zcat[1]	bastid_raZor	not so simple ... it's a notification icon
2008-06-03T11:59:00.000Z	zcat[1]	bastid_raZor	you sure? I ran compiz on a mx440
2008-06-03T12:01:00.000Z	zcat[1]	bastid_raZor	odd, I had a mx440 in a 1.1ghz box and it was quite acceptable.. not perfect but pretty smooth considering.
2008-06-03T12:04:00.000Z	zcat[1]	bastid_raZor	probably.. I had a simple 1024x768 desktop, played videos, didn't ever try to play two together and spin the cube around or anything.. but for just basic desktop use the effects worked pretty well
2008-08-31T07:23:00.000Z	zcat[1]	bastid_raZor	possibly, as long as neither wants to link part of the other in some way
2010-04-27T10:39:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	zcat[1]	zcat[1] apps > nautilus > destkop .. uncheck volumes_visible
2010-06-06T08:39:00.000Z	bastid_raZor	zcat[1]	i actually use deja vu book mono. looks a bit better than yours :P
