2009-11-25T19:46:00.000Z	naples_guy	ActionParsnip	thanks.  i now have a firefox folder on my desktop with a lock icon at the bottom of the folder
2009-11-25T19:46:00.000Z	naples_guy	ActionParsnip	what is the lock?
2009-11-25T19:48:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	naples_guy	you'll probably find its owned by root
2009-11-25T19:49:00.000Z	naples_guy	ActionParsnip	that won't matter right?  because i can gain root access
2009-11-25T19:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	naples_guy	if you dont want the folder, sure. I'd check see what it is first
2009-11-25T19:50:00.000Z	naples_guy	ActionParsnip	i meant the fact that it is owned by root will not matter for me
2009-11-25T19:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	naples_guy	well no, but check the folders ownership and the data in it
2009-11-25T19:53:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	naples_guy	if you run: sudo apt-get -f install    and it outputs 0 packages installed, you have everything you need
2009-11-25T19:54:00.000Z	naples_guy	ActionParsnip	i got zero.  i have used apt-get many times.  what is the -f switch
2009-11-25T19:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	naples_guy	fix
2009-11-25T19:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	naples_guy	installs any packages which are missing to make everything solid
2009-11-25T19:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	naples_guy	like if you install opera via deb, it has a deb which isnt satisfied, -f install installs the dep, then opera
