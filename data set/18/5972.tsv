2009-06-25T08:55:00.000Z	vip3rousmango	evon	when you restored the earlyer partition did it override the current partition setup you had?
2009-06-25T08:56:00.000Z	evon	vip3rousmango	yes it seems so
2009-06-25T08:56:00.000Z	vip3rousmango	evon	then testdisk over-rode your previous partition and its information, restoring it with the backup it thought you wanted.
2009-06-25T08:57:00.000Z	vip3rousmango	evon	whoa, you stoped it in the middle of the process?
2009-06-25T08:57:00.000Z	evon	vip3rousmango	you mean in test disk?
2009-06-25T08:57:00.000Z	evon	vip3rousmango	no i didn't do that
2009-06-25T08:57:00.000Z	vip3rousmango	evon	yes
2009-06-25T08:59:00.000Z	vip3rousmango	evon	it sounds to me that you won't be able to RECOVER lost data, but doing a fresh install formating the whole drive will reset it for future use, but I think you screwed yourself my friend. :(
2009-06-25T09:02:00.000Z	vip3rousmango	evon	if you try to install Ubuntu of the live cd, does the partition manager recognize the partitioned drive?
2009-06-25T09:04:00.000Z	evon	vip3rousmango	no it's just unallocated space. What i've already done is install ubuntu on a seperate HD so i can more easily try to fix the partition in question. I'm working on it as we speak
2009-06-25T09:06:00.000Z	vip3rousmango	evon	if you're using testdisk did you use gddrescue??
2009-06-25T09:07:00.000Z	evon	vip3rousmango	I have no idea what that is
