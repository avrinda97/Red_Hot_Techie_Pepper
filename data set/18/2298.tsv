2011-05-17T08:50:00.000Z	p_res	amber_	try a different torrent client to see if it connects also.
2011-05-17T08:51:00.000Z	p_res	amber_	does not need it.
2011-05-17T08:51:00.000Z	p_res	amber_	so no.
2011-05-17T08:51:00.000Z	p_res	amber_	no, that is not the issue.
2011-05-17T08:53:00.000Z	p_res	amber_	got a link for that? curious to see it.
2011-05-17T08:53:00.000Z	p_res	amber_	try another client. transmission is installed by default. try that and see if it connects.
