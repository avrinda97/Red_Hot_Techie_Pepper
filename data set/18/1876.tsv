2010-10-20T17:54:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	akaedintov	if nobody knows, do you want all 1600 of us to say no?
2010-10-20T17:55:00.000Z	akaedintov	ActionParsnip	, did i say anything like that you moron?
2010-10-20T17:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	akaedintov	you heavily implied it
2010-10-20T17:56:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	akaedintov	if nobody knows, they wont answer. Asking again after 8 seconds is pointless as the user list is the same
2010-10-20T17:56:00.000Z	akaedintov	ActionParsnip	, nope , this is just what you wanted to understand, and just say something about it.
2010-10-20T17:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	akaedintov	if people don't know, how can they answer you, so spamming the channel with repeated requests achieves nothing but spam the channel
2010-10-20T17:57:00.000Z	akaedintov	ActionParsnip	, why are you having this pointless conversation with me ? what is your point ? you feel yourself as a man because of this ????
2010-10-20T17:57:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	akaedintov	why not be smart and do some websearching, let the user list change a little. Then if you still have no answer you can re-ask.Different users will have different answers
2010-10-20T17:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	akaedintov	just want you to quit repeat asking, it'll get you nowhere
2010-10-20T17:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	akaedintov	clearly, NO
2010-10-20T17:58:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	akaedintov	who's the moron now?
2010-10-20T17:59:00.000Z	akaedintov	ActionParsnip	, still having this conversation huh ?
2010-10-20T17:59:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	akaedintov	no, its a new question...
2010-10-20T17:59:00.000Z	akaedintov	ActionParsnip	, what were you saying then ??
2010-10-20T18:00:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	akaedintov	never mind
