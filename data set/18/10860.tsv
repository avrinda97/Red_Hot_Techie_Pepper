2006-10-16T14:56:00.000Z	RichardCranium	NiteFears	what fixes? I can't even get a kernel for the thing
2006-10-16T14:57:00.000Z	NiteFears	RichardCranium	well, I'm on edgy and using it okay
2006-10-16T14:58:00.000Z	NiteFears	RichardCranium	that's right
2006-10-16T14:58:00.000Z	RichardCranium	NiteFears	so there appears to be some confusion whether I should use a Xeon or a generic kernel
2006-10-16T14:59:00.000Z	NiteFears	RichardCranium	you have definitely no reason to use xeon, as it's a completely unrelated architecture
2006-10-16T14:59:00.000Z	RichardCranium	NiteFears	then it would be generic for me?
2006-10-16T14:59:00.000Z	NiteFears	RichardCranium	I'm on generic, and it does use both cores
2006-10-16T15:00:00.000Z	RichardCranium	NiteFears	any kind of noticeable problems?
2006-10-16T15:01:00.000Z	NiteFears	RichardCranium	couldn't install dapper at all due to multiple problems. with edgy, I get constant beep from pc speaker during the boot and a green frame around the console
2006-10-16T15:01:00.000Z	RichardCranium	NiteFears	thats HORRID - im not having any issues like that
2006-10-16T15:03:00.000Z	NiteFears	RichardCranium	well, looks like I'm using a new and different MB - Asus p5b
2006-10-16T15:03:00.000Z	NiteFears	RichardCranium	if you're more lucky than me to have chosen a less rare chipset than intel, you might not see this
2006-10-16T15:04:00.000Z	RichardCranium	NiteFears	ahh asrock 775i65G here
2006-10-16T15:04:00.000Z	RichardCranium	NiteFears	865G - solid as a rock
2006-10-16T15:13:00.000Z	RichardCranium	NiteFears	my kernel is running at the wrong speed!!!
2006-10-16T15:13:00.000Z	NiteFears	RichardCranium	I have no cure :) try edgy
2006-10-16T15:14:00.000Z	NiteFears	RichardCranium	what processing is that?
2006-10-16T15:15:00.000Z	NiteFears	RichardCranium	screw it and install 32-bit image :)
