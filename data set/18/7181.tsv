2009-01-06T13:04:00.000Z	Quagmire		any thoughts on my irc client question?
2009-01-06T13:06:00.000Z	Quagmire		irssi for cli clients ..please excuse my confusion ziroday
2009-01-06T13:06:00.000Z	rww	Quagmire	Pidgin is nice if you also want to sign into IM accounts. XChat (not xchat-gnome) is a good graphical IRC-only client. IRSSI is a good command-line client.
2009-01-06T13:10:00.000Z	rww	Quagmire	if you decide to use it, let me know. There's a couple of configuration changes that make it much easier to use on Ubuntu.
2009-01-06T13:13:00.000Z	rww	Quagmire	okays. When you want to start using bitlbee, open up a terminal and "sudo nano /etc/bitlbee/bitlbee.conf", then change RunMode to something other than Inetd (either of the two Daemon options will work). You might want to look through the rest of the file too; it's really well documented.
2009-01-06T13:13:00.000Z	rww	Quagmire	and then "sudo /etc/init.d/bitlbee restart" when you're done editing the configuration
2009-01-06T13:20:00.000Z	rww	Quagmire	in X-Chat, right?
2009-01-06T13:21:00.000Z	rww	Quagmire	k. FYI, with Bitlbee, you're gonna want to add a new server with the address 127.0.0.1
2009-01-06T13:22:00.000Z	rww	Quagmire	connect to server 127.0.0.1. It'll put you into a channel named &bitlbee automatically, which should tell you how to set up your IM accounts.
2009-01-06T13:43:00.000Z	rww	Quagmire	sorry, was off doing other stuff. Do you still need help connecting to another server in XChat?
2009-01-06T13:50:00.000Z	Quagmire	rww	I'm not getting it to work ...I'm positive that I don;t have the correct info listed in the server list
2009-01-06T13:51:00.000Z	rww	Quagmire	in the window with the options for "Your Details" and "Connecting" and such?
2009-01-06T13:52:00.000Z	Quagmire	rww	under the networks list I added one called 127.0.0.1
2009-01-06T13:52:00.000Z	rww	Quagmire	right. Did you then hit "Edit" and set the server address?
2009-01-06T13:53:00.000Z	rww	Quagmire	the name you put in the actual Network List window (the one with "User information" at the top) is just a name. The actual address (127.0.0.1 in this case) needs to be put in by clicking "Edit" and adding it.
2009-01-06T13:53:00.000Z	rww	Quagmire	give me a sec and I'll put up a screenshot that might explain it better
2009-01-06T13:57:00.000Z	rww	Quagmire	RatPackSopra: http://rww.name/ubuntu/bitlbee.png
2009-01-06T13:58:00.000Z	rww	Quagmire	RatPackSopra: make it look like that, except with a blank Server password (since you didn't make an account yet)
