2006-08-17T12:53:00.000Z	BlueEagle	ivx	I see.
2006-08-17T12:51:00.000Z	BlueEagle	ivx	That depends on what the problem with it is.
2006-08-17T12:52:00.000Z	BlueEagle	ivx	Keep in mind that I do not own any wireless network cards and have never set one up myself. :)
2006-08-17T12:53:00.000Z	BlueEagle	ivx	run this command in the terminal: lspci|grep wireless
2006-08-17T12:53:00.000Z	BlueEagle	ivx	if it returns a line tell me what it is.
2006-08-17T12:54:00.000Z	BlueEagle	ivx	if it doesn't then tell me that it didn't return a line.
2006-08-17T12:54:00.000Z	BlueEagle	ivx	ok. Try: lspci
2006-08-17T12:54:00.000Z	BlueEagle	ivx	look for something that sais network and is not your regular network card.
2006-08-17T12:56:00.000Z	BlueEagle	ivx	I need to know which chip and stuff it is. Since it is just one line you can paste it here.
2006-08-17T12:57:00.000Z	BlueEagle	ivx	same card as rast4_ then.
2006-08-17T12:58:00.000Z	BlueEagle	ivx	http://www.ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=1071920&mode=linear has got instructions on how to extract the firmware from your windows drivers and install them in ubuntu.
2006-08-17T12:58:00.000Z	BlueEagle	ivx	however rast4_ didn't get it working properly :/
2006-08-17T13:01:00.000Z	BlueEagle	ivx	Well since I do not own any wireless network cards I am not able to help you. I'm sorry.
2006-08-17T13:01:00.000Z	BlueEagle	ivx	if you tried this how to (2/3 success rate approx) and it didn't work then you're one fo the last third.
2006-08-17T13:01:00.000Z	BlueEagle	ivx	np
