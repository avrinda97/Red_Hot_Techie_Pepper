2008-09-26T08:17:00.000Z	^paradox^		so can someone give me a hand?
2008-09-26T08:18:00.000Z	jrib	^paradox^	best to just ask the channel your question
2008-09-26T08:21:00.000Z	jrib	^paradox^	ask an actual question.  Most of us have no idea what you are finishing up
2008-09-26T08:23:00.000Z	jrib	^paradox^	k, well I'm just telling you that if you actual want help from people that have just joined, then you should be repeating your question with details.  Otherwise address the users who helped you before
2010-04-07T23:32:00.000Z	jrib	^paradox^	does it work for you?
2010-04-07T23:33:00.000Z	^paradox^	jrib	yes with no problems
2010-04-07T23:33:00.000Z	jrib	^paradox^	version issue or pebkac
2010-04-07T23:34:00.000Z	^paradox^	jrib	i dont think he was using archive manager
2010-04-07T23:36:00.000Z	jrib	^paradox^	you should verify with a third-party
2010-04-07T23:36:00.000Z	^paradox^	jrib	i forgot others have successfully opened unprotected zips of mine if it matters
2010-04-07T23:37:00.000Z	jrib	^paradox^	I would give the same file to someone else and see if it works for them.  Also, have this user check the md5sum
2010-04-07T23:37:00.000Z	^paradox^	jrib	i would if any my friends were on
2010-04-07T23:40:00.000Z	^paradox^	jrib	the archive was created on my external hard drive and uploaded to a file host from there. would that make any difference?
2010-04-07T23:40:00.000Z	jrib	^paradox^	nope
2010-04-07T23:41:00.000Z	jrib	^paradox^	does the md5sum he gave you match yours?
2010-04-07T23:42:00.000Z	^paradox^	jrib	he hasnt given me one. hes not on right now
2010-04-07T23:42:00.000Z	jrib	^paradox^	wait until he is then, not much else you can do
2010-04-07T23:42:00.000Z	^paradox^	jrib	ok i appreciate the info
