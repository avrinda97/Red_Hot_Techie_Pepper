2009-03-08T15:13:00.000Z	wanttotryubuntu		hello, after all possible permutations and combinations, still LIVE CD wont leave busybox
2009-03-08T15:14:00.000Z	wanttotryubuntu		its my first day of linux .. i cant seem to install it.. i have already wasted 7 cds
2009-03-08T15:16:00.000Z	bazhang	wanttotryubuntu	did you md5 the iso; it may well be corrupt
2009-03-08T15:17:00.000Z	wanttotryubuntu	bazhang	.. yes, all basic precautions have been taken
2009-03-08T15:17:00.000Z	bazhang	wanttotryubuntu	what would those be; please elaborate
2009-03-08T15:18:00.000Z	bazhang	wanttotryubuntu	such as disk integrity check, burning iso at low speed, and md5 sum check
2009-03-08T15:18:00.000Z	wanttotryubuntu	bazhang	.. wrote the cds , tested at my friend's place [ we have exactly the same hardware ] .. they work like charm
2009-03-08T15:19:00.000Z	bazhang	wanttotryubuntu	then I suggest you remove quiet and splash from kernel boot options to see what the exact errors are
2009-03-08T15:19:00.000Z	wanttotryubuntu	bazhang	they boot nicely as live cd on his pc .. my pc is exactly the same but all cds go to busybox .. following are the errors which i wrote down after doing  noacpi  acpi=off  as was told to me by Seaphor
2009-03-08T15:20:00.000Z	bazhang	wanttotryubuntu	please try what I have suggested as well
2009-03-08T15:21:00.000Z	wanttotryubuntu	bazhang	and something like 'bios' failed to hand off ACPE [or something] BUG? .. and so on
2009-03-08T15:25:00.000Z	bazhang	wanttotryubuntu	without more specificity of the bug and exact error message cant really tell you
2009-03-08T15:32:00.000Z	bazhang	wanttotryubuntu	and what were the errors shown when removing quiet and splash from kernel boot options
2009-03-08T15:39:00.000Z	bazhang	wanttotryubuntu	what were the errors with removing quiet and splash from kernel boot options --> paste.ubuntu.com with them please
2009-03-08T15:39:00.000Z	wanttotryubuntu	bazhang	i would love to do that.. this is my first try of linux, i tried selecting text there but i could not
2009-03-08T15:40:00.000Z	wanttotryubuntu	bazhang	how to copy and save the text there ? so that i can open the file in windows and paste it
2009-03-08T15:40:00.000Z	bazhang	wanttotryubuntu	and you removed those (quiet and splash ) from kernel boot options?
2009-03-08T15:40:00.000Z	wanttotryubuntu	bazhang	yes, seaphore told me that one .. then splash screen doesnt come and many commands run
