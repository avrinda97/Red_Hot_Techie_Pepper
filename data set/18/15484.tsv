2005-03-17T08:56:00.000Z	utsav		I have a quick question.. I want to compile a vanilla ubuntu kernel.. How should I go about getting the source?
2005-03-17T08:57:00.000Z	LinuxJones	utsav	you need to search for linux-source
2005-03-17T09:04:00.000Z	LinuxJones	utsav	the ubuntu source will have ubuntu patches
2005-03-17T09:06:00.000Z	LinuxJones	utsav	why are you compiling the kernel ?
2005-03-17T09:13:00.000Z	utsav	LinuxJones	Once I saw that with an alps patch, my touchpad could have circular scrolling, I decided it's amust do
2005-03-17T09:14:00.000Z	LinuxJones	utsav	nice
2005-03-17T09:14:00.000Z	utsav	LinuxJones	 Hopefully my last question.. I've got all the patches applied now.. I was just wondering if I can use an existing kernel config from ubuntu
2005-03-17T09:15:00.000Z	LinuxJones	utsav	yeah it's in /boot/
2005-03-17T09:16:00.000Z	LinuxJones	utsav	just copy it over to /usr/src/linux and make your changes and your good to go
2005-03-17T09:16:00.000Z	LinuxJones	utsav	of course you will have to rename it
