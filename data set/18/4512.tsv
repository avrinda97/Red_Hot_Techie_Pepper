2010-01-11T21:45:00.000Z	packetcase		I've got some partitioning problems. On my hard drive I have four partitions: Free space1, swap, linux, free space2. How can I merge the free space into one partition?
2010-01-11T21:46:00.000Z	DasEi	packetcase	got to use a live cd, first delete swap, too, then set it up at another location later, correct uuid of fstab
2010-01-11T21:47:00.000Z	DasEi	packetcase	have you got a live cd handy ?
2010-01-11T21:48:00.000Z	DasEi	packetcase	bott it and come back in, then get it done
2010-01-11T21:48:00.000Z	packetcase	DasEi	Done.
2010-01-11T21:49:00.000Z	DasEi	packetcase	hehe, k : sudo apt-get install gparted (if not already there)
2010-01-11T21:53:00.000Z	packetcase	DasEi	What to do with gparted?
2010-01-11T21:56:00.000Z	packetcase	DasEi	What to do with gparted?
2010-01-11T21:57:00.000Z	DasEi	packetcase	sudo gparted
2010-01-11T21:57:00.000Z	packetcase	DasEi	HAL daemon is not started:-(
2010-01-11T21:58:00.000Z	DasEi	packetcase	sudo /etc/init.d/hal restart
2010-01-11T21:59:00.000Z	packetcase	DasEi	I'm working from the command line, can't run gparted.
2010-01-11T22:01:00.000Z	DasEi	packetcase	I asked you to boot a live cd, you said done . . ?
2010-01-11T22:01:00.000Z	packetcase	DasEi	Yes, but no GUI.
2010-01-11T22:02:00.000Z	packetcase	DasEi	Will it be possible to accomplish without using gparted?
2010-01-11T22:04:00.000Z	DasEi	packetcase	yes , can use command line tools with zyclinders, but I won't help there, too much hassle and can easily cause harm, man mkfs is waht you want
2010-01-11T22:05:00.000Z	packetcase	DasEi	I do not have any valuable data on my hard disk, I just want to avoid reformating and reinstallation.
2010-01-11T22:07:00.000Z	DasEi	packetcase	so why not use the convient live cd ? or just put the iso on a usb stick to even save a cd
