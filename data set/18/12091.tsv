2006-07-06T15:24:00.000Z	kholerabbi		Hello
2006-07-06T15:25:00.000Z	kholerabbi		I just installed dapper - but it doesn't have the highest supported resolution of my monitor (1280x1024), and goes only to 1024x768 - how do I configure it to show 1280x2024?
2006-07-06T15:26:00.000Z	eth42	kholerabbi	first, try dpkg-reconfigure xserver-xorg
2006-07-06T15:26:00.000Z	kholerabbi	eth42	oK
2006-07-06T15:28:00.000Z	kholerabbi	eth42	what xserver driver do I select??
2006-07-06T15:29:00.000Z	eth42	kholerabbi	can you accept adefault choice??
2006-07-06T15:29:00.000Z	kholerabbi	eth42	savage?
2006-07-06T15:31:00.000Z	kholerabbi	eth42	Should I select savage, I think it's default
2006-07-06T15:31:00.000Z	eth42	kholerabbi	mhh... I don't know without knowing your system. I'd just press ENTER (= accept default), wherever I don't know. I'd make a backup of /etc/X11/xorg.conf first, so you can always return to your current state.
2006-07-06T15:32:00.000Z	eth42	kholerabbi	then you can try out whatever you like, without doing any harm to your system
2006-07-06T15:32:00.000Z	kholerabbi	eth42	Is there another way of doing this - it has to configure ton of things, and I have no idea - can't I just add the resolution? I had it with breezy
2006-07-06T15:33:00.000Z	eth42	kholerabbi	if you still have access to your /etc/X11/xorg.conf on your breezy system, just take this one.....
2006-07-06T15:33:00.000Z	kholerabbi	eth42	I reformatted over breezy
2006-07-06T15:33:00.000Z	eth42	kholerabbi	sure, you can add your resolution somehow. but I don't know how right now... :-)
2006-07-06T15:34:00.000Z	eth42	kholerabbi	I guess it depends on the configuration of your monitor and the Display sections in the Screen section
2006-07-06T15:34:00.000Z	eth42	kholerabbi	(in xorg.conf that is)
2006-07-06T15:36:00.000Z	kholerabbi	eth42	in breezy it asked me what resolutions I'd like, but dapper didn't :(
2006-07-06T15:37:00.000Z	eth42	kholerabbi	still I'd first try dpkg-reconfigure and just press ENTER, whenever I don't care or don't know....
