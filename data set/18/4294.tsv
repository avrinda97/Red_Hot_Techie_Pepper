2009-05-02T21:22:00.000Z	ghoti	lazerman	first we need to get things working again, and once they are, you can try perhaps installing the next most recent driver, to see if that works properly.
2009-05-02T21:23:00.000Z	lazerman		ok
2009-05-02T21:23:00.000Z	lazerman		how to bring it in the previous state without reinstalling Ubuntu
