2005-11-22T11:29:00.000Z	blanky		okay listen
2005-11-22T11:29:00.000Z	blanky		wmplayer-mozilla only works in mozilla (at least for me)
2005-11-22T11:29:00.000Z	blanky		not firefox
2005-11-22T11:30:00.000Z	blanky		how do I install xine, I installed totem-xine but I didnt know how to run it (just run totem?)
2005-11-22T11:31:00.000Z	blanky		okay, look, wmv files aren't working for me with mplayer in firefox :'(
2005-11-22T11:31:00.000Z	blanky		only in mozilla
2005-11-22T11:32:00.000Z	blanky		where can i get firefox plugins
2005-11-22T11:32:00.000Z	mustard5	blanky	which particular plugin are you after?
2005-11-22T11:33:00.000Z	blanky	mustard5	mplayer
2005-11-22T11:34:00.000Z	blanky	mustard5	the only helper I get and he's not talking :'(
2005-11-22T11:34:00.000Z	mustard5	blanky	hmm...I know mozplugger allows apps to run in firefox, but I think firefox would probably end up using totem as totem is the default
2005-11-22T11:35:00.000Z	mustard5	blanky	you might be able to set mplayer as the default, but thats something that I am not sure how to do.
2005-11-22T11:36:00.000Z	mustard5	blanky	is there any reason why you wouldn't want totem to run in firefox instead?
2005-11-22T11:37:00.000Z	mustard5	blanky	I believe its possible, I just don't know how
2005-11-22T11:45:00.000Z	mustard5	blanky	did you restart firefox and try it after doing the command dducko showed you?
2005-11-22T11:45:00.000Z	blanky	mustard5	i didnt try the command
2005-11-22T11:46:00.000Z	mustard5	blanky	well it appears that that would take totem completely out of the equation with regards to firefox
2005-11-22T11:47:00.000Z	mustard5	blanky	thats the plan
