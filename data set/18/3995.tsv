2009-07-15T03:48:00.000Z	gabriel-bezerra		hi guys, is there a problem with python upgrade to the latest* version?
2009-07-15T03:48:00.000Z	gabriel-bezerra		my programs made in python stoped working
2009-07-15T03:49:00.000Z	gabriel-bezerra		after a system upgrade
2009-07-15T03:49:00.000Z	syslq78	gabriel-bezerra	do which python
2009-07-15T03:50:00.000Z	syslq78	gabriel-bezerra	it probably made python 3.0 default and it broke compatibility
2009-07-15T03:50:00.000Z	syslq78	gabriel-bezerra	dunno just guessing
2009-07-15T03:51:00.000Z	syslq78	gabriel-bezerra	ah
2009-07-15T03:51:00.000Z	syslq78	gabriel-bezerra	python path
2009-07-15T03:52:00.000Z	syslq78	gabriel-bezerra	start python
2009-07-15T03:52:00.000Z	syslq78	gabriel-bezerra	print sys.path
2009-07-15T03:53:00.000Z	gabriel-bezerra	syslq78	to do that i have to import sys, right?
2009-07-15T03:53:00.000Z	syslq78	gabriel-bezerra	from what you told it seems python can not find that lib so it's not in path probably
2009-07-15T03:53:00.000Z	syslq78	gabriel-bezerra	yeah, you mean any lib doesnt work?
2009-07-15T03:58:00.000Z	gabriel-bezerra	syslq78	i can import math, for example
2009-07-15T03:59:00.000Z	gabriel-bezerra	syslq78	so i think it is not a problem in path, ok?
2009-07-15T03:59:00.000Z	syslq78	gabriel-bezerra	what is the error ?
2009-07-15T03:59:00.000Z	gabriel-bezerra	syslq78	it is quite big
