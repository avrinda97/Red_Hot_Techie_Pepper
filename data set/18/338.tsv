2012-04-10T17:21:00.000Z	wavded		any buddy know how to allow locks on files in a mounted drive?
2012-04-10T17:21:00.000Z	ikonia	wavded	sorry what ?
2012-04-10T17:22:00.000Z	ikonia	wavded	why has it stopped working ?
2012-04-10T17:22:00.000Z	ikonia	wavded	ok, so you need to look at how the perl script is creating the lock file
2012-04-10T17:22:00.000Z	ikonia	wavded	I suspect your permissions are wrong based on that error
2012-04-10T17:22:00.000Z	ikonia	wavded	what file ?
2012-04-10T17:23:00.000Z	ikonia	wavded	what file system is on the mounted drive ?
2012-04-10T17:23:00.000Z	ikonia	wavded	where is the perl script trying to write a lock file to ?
2012-04-10T17:29:00.000Z	wavded	ikonia	in the article they talk about making sure rpc.lockd and rpc.statd are running but those programs don't seem to exist in ubuntu server anymore (last man page I could find was for dapper :)
2012-04-10T17:30:00.000Z	ikonia	wavded	they should still exist, let me do a little research
2012-04-10T17:30:00.000Z	wavded	ikonia	thanks
2012-04-10T17:34:00.000Z	wavded	ikonia	also if it helps, this is how the lock is being created - http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/flock.html
2012-04-10T17:47:00.000Z	ikonia	wavded	from what I'm reading those rpc services should still be available
2012-04-10T17:47:00.000Z	ikonia	wavded	they are still a part of the nfs v4 standard
2012-04-10T17:47:00.000Z	wavded	ikonia	do you know what package its in or how to start them?   i didn't have luck so far
2012-04-10T18:15:00.000Z	wavded	ikonia	if you were looking at all for that package, don't worry about it, i'll dive in more and let you know if i have any questions, thanks for your help
2012-04-10T18:16:00.000Z	ikonia	wavded	I'm wondering if this has been merged into the nfs packages in later versions of ubuntu
2012-04-10T18:16:00.000Z	ikonia	wavded	eg: the rpc package now contains all of these
