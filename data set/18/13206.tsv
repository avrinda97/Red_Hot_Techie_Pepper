2005-12-25T13:21:00.000Z	JFlash		i'm trying to install Beep Media Player. i have downloaded a .deb  file, but my system wont open it. what should I do?
2005-12-25T13:22:00.000Z	djm62	JFlash	from a terminal, sudo dpkg -i bmp... (whatever the filename is)
2005-12-25T13:22:00.000Z	djm62	JFlash	on a higher level, why have you downloaded a .deb file? couldn't you get it from the package manager?
2005-12-25T13:23:00.000Z	djm62	JFlash	not necessarily boys ;) System->Administration->Add Packages
2005-12-25T13:24:00.000Z	djm62	JFlash	is designed so you never have to know what a .deb is, nor how to install one
2005-12-25T13:24:00.000Z	djm62	JFlash	beg pardon, System->Administration->Add Applications
2005-12-25T13:34:00.000Z	JFlash	djm62	are you still there?
2005-12-25T13:34:00.000Z	djm62	JFlash	yes
2005-12-25T13:35:00.000Z	djm62	JFlash	and applied changes?
2005-12-25T13:35:00.000Z	djm62	JFlash	not on breezy it won't
2005-12-25T13:37:00.000Z	JFlash	djm62	 is that the version you are using?
2005-12-25T13:38:00.000Z	djm62	JFlash	I like rhythmbox myself...but the version in synaptic has been quality controlled and will be safe to install, if you're using a supported distro
2005-12-25T13:39:00.000Z	JFlash	djm62	thank you!
2005-12-25T13:39:00.000Z	djm62	JFlash	the package management stuff is really nice, unless you have particularly specialist needs you should never need to download a .deb
2005-12-25T13:40:00.000Z	JFlash	djm62	indeed. it's hot!
2005-12-25T13:42:00.000Z	djm62	JFlash	System->Preferences->Font
2005-12-25T13:43:00.000Z	djm62	JFlash	because people's taste in eyecandy doesn't correlate well with eyesight ;)
2005-12-26T15:45:00.000Z	djm62	JFlash	it downloads things from the web without you opening a web-browser
