2009-05-06T00:12:00.000Z	imp0steur		Hi guys
2009-05-06T00:13:00.000Z	imp0steur		I have a question .. Is it safe to have /home on NTFS partition??
2009-05-06T00:14:00.000Z	imp0steur		anybody ?? Is it safe to have move /home to NTFS partition??
2009-05-06T00:16:00.000Z	unop	imp0steur	 I wouldn't suggest doing that .. some programs could behave funny because they need the right unix permissions and ownership on files in your home dir
2009-05-06T00:17:00.000Z	imp0steur	unop	Ok .. but how often does data gets stored in /home??
2009-05-06T00:18:00.000Z	unop	imp0steur	every time a program needs to make a record of setting that pertain to you .. and with a regular desktop, that is - very often
2009-05-06T00:18:00.000Z	imp0steur	unop	m new to linux .. /home would b used for users configuration and preferences??
2009-05-06T00:18:00.000Z	unop	imp0steur	that's right
2009-05-06T00:19:00.000Z	imp0steur	unop	yes .. I have a large NTFS partition where I generally store my data .. So if my /home isn't big .. it would b ok right??
2009-05-06T00:20:00.000Z	unop	imp0steur	bad logic - no, even if you didn't have very much - you still need a unix filesystem
2009-05-06T00:21:00.000Z	imp0steur	unop	I mean all my downloads, music n movies goes into my ntfs drive .. anything related to Ubuntu stays in /root I have not created a separate /home ..
2009-05-06T00:22:00.000Z	unop	imp0steur	put all your personal data like that in a separate directory like ~/Desktop .. and mount ~/Desktop on your ntfs drive - that would be ok
2009-05-06T00:23:00.000Z	imp0steur	unop	Ok .. But is it safe in using read/write NTFS?? I have auto mounted the NTFS partitions .. I read a thread (Probably an old one) that says its not safe to read/write NTFS .. I am using Ubuntu 9.04 x64
2009-05-06T00:25:00.000Z	unop	imp0steur	if you value your data - use a reputed filesystem - that's my 2 pence.
2009-05-06T00:26:00.000Z	imp0steur	unop	reputed filesystem ext?
2009-05-06T00:27:00.000Z	unop	imp0steur	ext is probably the most widely used/supported, it's a safe bet.
2009-05-06T00:28:00.000Z	imp0steur	unop	humm ok
2009-05-06T00:29:00.000Z	imp0steur	unop	hateball: thank you guys .. I would not stick with whatever partition I have ..
