2007-03-26T10:08:00.000Z	Coldopm		Sorry, Can anyone post a link where I can grab the Alternate CD for Edgy? I can only find the main image....
2007-03-26T10:08:00.000Z	Flannel	Coldopm	you have to click the "All download location" thing on the bottom, then you get the old download thing (then "additional install options")
2007-03-26T10:09:00.000Z	Coldopm	Flannel	The other install option links, Thank you!
2007-03-26T10:10:00.000Z	Flannel	Coldopm	yeah, it's a really bad UI now.  There's a few bugreports about it ;)
2007-06-27T14:25:00.000Z	Flannel	Coldopm	Xauthory? or ICEauthority?  Sound familiar?
2007-06-27T14:25:00.000Z	Coldopm	Flannel	no it doesn't, want me to restart and write down exact error?
2007-06-27T14:25:00.000Z	Flannel	Coldopm	exact errors are always better.  Yeah, if you don't mind.
2007-06-27T14:34:00.000Z	Coldopm	Flannel	The error I am getting is, "GDM could not write to your authorization file. This could be because you are out of Disk Space, or your home directory is not open for writing. In any case you cannot be logged in. Please contact your system admin."
2007-06-27T14:34:00.000Z	Flannel	Coldopm	alright, so the next question is obviously, are you out of space?  Or are your permissions messed up?
2007-06-27T14:35:00.000Z	Coldopm	Flannel	I have no idea how to check my current permissions since I am running LiveCD
2007-06-27T14:35:00.000Z	Flannel	Coldopm	You can boot up into single user mode (at grub, recovery console), that'll just be a terminal.  And you can check your permissions for your home folder and stuff.
2007-06-27T14:35:00.000Z	Flannel	Coldopm	oh, ok.  You'll just need to mount your harddrive
2007-06-27T14:36:00.000Z	Flannel	Coldopm	yeah.
2007-06-27T14:36:00.000Z	Coldopm	Flannel	One sec i will brb
2007-06-27T14:36:00.000Z	Coldopm	Flannel	Can you give me a hint as to how to mount my HD?
2007-06-27T14:38:00.000Z	Coldopm	Flannel	Is there a chance I can login as /root and change the permissions from there?
2007-06-27T14:38:00.000Z	Flannel	Coldopm	https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Mount#head-0fdee867fdf2bacbf96cfbb0c41eda446d2ca8ee  but, I've gotta run. There are plenty of other people that can help.  You can chagne permissions from the liveCD, actually.
2007-06-27T14:38:00.000Z	Coldopm	Flannel	ty anyways
