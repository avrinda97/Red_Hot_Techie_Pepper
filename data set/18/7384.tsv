2009-05-09T08:08:00.000Z	Scunizi	Armageddon	came in late and didn't get the previous part of the conversation.. you don't have an 8200 gforce amd chipset do you?
2009-05-09T08:09:00.000Z	Armageddon	Scunizi	ATI/AMD
2009-05-09T08:10:00.000Z	Scunizi	Armageddon	ATI is one issue.. the amd portion depends on the chipset.. I have gforce 8200 and can't boot unless i have pci=nomsi on the kernel line
2009-05-09T08:11:00.000Z	Armageddon	Scunizi	i used to be able to boot perfectly, but i was installing a gadget, changing compiz options, desktop crashed, i restarted, it was still crashing, so i restarted into a recovery mode and used the auto graphic repair thingy and now it doesnt even login
2009-05-09T08:12:00.000Z	Scunizi	Armageddon	amd64 bit?
2009-05-09T08:12:00.000Z	Armageddon	Scunizi	 yes
2009-05-09T08:13:00.000Z	Scunizi	Armageddon	that's a tough one.. you might consider backing down to 32 bit.. there's just weird issues with 64 bit on occation
2009-05-09T08:13:00.000Z	Armageddon	Scunizi	it took me 3 days none stop on 15k to update, im not doing it again... not a chance
2009-05-09T08:15:00.000Z	Scunizi	Armageddon	wait a bit.. until the newness of the latest release calms down.. then you won't have a problem
