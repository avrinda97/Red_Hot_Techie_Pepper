2009-09-07T01:46:00.000Z	lightpriest__		has anyone run into alsamixer showing a level of zero (0) and cannot be changed?
2009-09-07T01:46:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lightpriest__	yeah but then i compiled alsa and it was fine
2009-09-07T01:48:00.000Z	lightpriest__	ActionParsnip	compiled from the package sources?
2009-09-07T01:48:00.000Z	lightpriest__	ActionParsnip	it happend after a kernel upgrade
2009-09-07T01:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lightpriest__	you'll need the driver for sound for your new kernel
2009-09-07T01:49:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lightpriest__	did yuor system work ok with the old kernel?
2009-09-07T01:49:00.000Z	lightpriest__	ActionParsnip	i have it. the module exists. alsa loads it properly and aplay shows the correct driver. even /dev/urandom | aplay works fine
2009-09-07T01:50:00.000Z	lightpriest__	ActionParsnip	it did work, in the kernel on the live CD
2009-09-07T01:50:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lightpriest__	then you dont need the newer kernel, the old one is fine
2009-09-07T01:51:00.000Z	lightpriest__	ActionParsnip	bahh I'll try installing the old one
2009-09-07T01:51:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lightpriest__	kernels provide harware and memory access
2009-09-07T01:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lightpriest__	if your system is doing all those fine you do NOT need to upgrade the kernel
2009-09-07T01:52:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lightpriest__	newer isnt better
2009-09-07T01:52:00.000Z	lightpriest__	ActionParsnip	i know all that. it just surprised me ;)
2009-10-21T13:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lightpriest__	i'd use brainstorm
2009-10-21T13:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lightpriest__	have you not found a ppa for it?
2009-10-21T13:55:00.000Z	lightpriest__	ActionParsnip	brainstorm isn't a place to raise ideas? :)
2009-10-21T13:55:00.000Z	ActionParsnip	lightpriest__	yeah, an idea to compile a package, if its inappropriate it will be moved to the right place
