2009-03-11T20:00:00.000Z	gnu_d		Hey, what to do with Nautilus ?
2009-03-11T20:01:00.000Z	gnu_d		Come on, it's emergency, how to rebuild Nautilus !
2009-03-11T20:03:00.000Z	sipior	gnu_d	what were you doing in nautilus at the time it crashed?
2009-03-11T20:03:00.000Z	gnu_d	sipior	I dropped images in the folder.
2009-03-11T20:03:00.000Z	sipior	gnu_d	and the bug is reproducible?
2009-03-11T20:04:00.000Z	gnu_d	sipior	I don't know, but when I paste stuff also crashes.
2009-03-11T20:07:00.000Z	sipior	gnu_d	you might have to downgrade, but did the problem start immediately after upgrading to Ibex?
2009-03-11T20:08:00.000Z	gnu_d	sipior	yes
2009-03-11T20:08:00.000Z	gnu_d	sipior	I'll change to dolphin then ]:).
2009-03-11T20:08:00.000Z	sipior	gnu_d	then i'd have a look to see if a bug has been filed, although i haven't heard of anything like that biting a lot of people. you might be stuck going back to the earlier version.
2009-03-11T20:08:00.000Z	sipior	gnu_d	dolphin?
2009-03-11T20:09:00.000Z	gnu_d	sipior	it's the official KDE file-browser, there is an option in gconf-editor to set which file-browser to start in Gnome.
2009-03-11T20:11:00.000Z	sipior	gnu_d	half a moment: which file browser are you trying to use? you're logged into gnome, yes?
2009-03-11T20:11:00.000Z	sipior	gnu_d	ah wait, i see what you meant.
2009-03-11T20:11:00.000Z	gnu_d	sipior	are kidding me ?
2009-03-11T20:11:00.000Z	gnu_d	sipior	sorry I got a headache
2009-03-11T20:11:00.000Z	sipior	gnu_d	no, i simply didn't understand what you wrote
2009-03-11T20:13:00.000Z	gnu_d	sipior	ow, I forgot, there is a "sudo: unable to resolve host xxx"
