2005-10-09T14:57:00.000Z	vbgunz_		anyone know of the best POSIX reference guide ever!?
2005-10-09T14:57:00.000Z	bob2	vbgunz_	SUSv3
2005-10-09T14:58:00.000Z	vbgunz_	bob2	SUSv3?
2005-10-09T14:59:00.000Z	bob2	vbgunz_	yes, it contains basically all of POSIX, and it's freely available (unlike posix)
2005-10-09T15:01:00.000Z	vbgunz_	bob2	is this what you mean? http://www.unix.org/single_unix_specification/
2005-10-09T15:01:00.000Z	vbgunz_	bob2	version 3?
2005-10-09T15:01:00.000Z	bob2	vbgunz_	that looks right
2005-10-09T15:01:00.000Z	vbgunz_	bob2	thank you
2005-10-09T15:01:00.000Z	bob2	vbgunz_	tho, I dunno if it's what you were asking for
2005-10-09T15:02:00.000Z	bob2	vbgunz_	that's probably not what you want then
2005-10-09T15:03:00.000Z	bob2	vbgunz_	perhaps http://www.linuxdevcenter.com/linux/cmd/
2005-10-09T15:04:00.000Z	vbgunz_	bob2	nice
2005-10-09T15:04:00.000Z	vbgunz_	bob2	very nice
2005-10-09T15:04:00.000Z	vbgunz_	bob2	I hope this is it
2005-10-09T15:05:00.000Z	vbgunz_	bob2	thats enough to get me started... I wish I had the PDF to it though... I'll see if I can buy it
2005-10-09T15:05:00.000Z	bob2	vbgunz_	it's from "linux in a nutshell", from o'reilly.  I've heard it's a great book, but I've never read it
2005-10-09T15:06:00.000Z	bob2	vbgunz_	hehe
2005-10-09T15:06:00.000Z	vbgunz_	bob2	this is almost exactly what I've been looking for ;)
