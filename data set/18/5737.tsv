2008-08-29T08:30:00.000Z	einstein2001		i need a little help with the workspace switcher applet
2008-08-29T08:32:00.000Z	einstein2001		what direcctory is "/schemas/apps/workspace_switcher_applet/prefs" under???
2008-08-29T08:33:00.000Z	tester5	einstein2001	it's in the program gconf-editor
2008-08-29T08:33:00.000Z	tester5	einstein2001	just go to a terminal and type gconf-editor
2008-08-29T08:37:00.000Z	tester5	einstein2001	what are you trying to change?
2008-08-29T08:38:00.000Z	tester5	einstein2001	what kind of error?
2008-08-29T08:40:00.000Z	tester5	einstein2001	hmm, are you using ubuntu 6.06?
2008-08-29T08:43:00.000Z	tester5	einstein2001	maybe in synaptic you could right click rthem and "mark for reinstallation"
2008-08-29T08:46:00.000Z	tester5	einstein2001	that was a typo... probably "gnome-panel" and "gnome-panel-data"
2008-08-29T08:50:00.000Z	tester5	einstein2001	hmm, there's also "gnome-applets" and "gnome-applets-data" you could try out too if those other ones don't work
2008-08-29T08:57:00.000Z	tester5	einstein2001	probably not... let's try the gconf-editor instead for a second
2008-08-29T08:59:00.000Z	tester5	einstein2001	OK, go to /apps/panel/applets/ for a sec
2008-08-29T09:01:00.000Z	tester5	einstein2001	in "/apps/panel/applets/" is there a folder called "applet_1" or "applet_2" or something like that?
2008-08-29T09:06:00.000Z	tester5	einstein2001	sorry to load this comlicated page on you, but try following the advice here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=95981
2008-08-29T09:07:00.000Z	tester5	einstein2001	ok, good luck
2008-08-29T09:09:00.000Z	einstein2001	tester5	well it looks like the same problem because i tried the gdesklets switcher before i decided to revert to the gnome switcher.
2008-08-29T09:11:00.000Z	tester5	einstein2001	that sounds good then, since he says he fixed it on that page
