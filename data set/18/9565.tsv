2007-03-20T14:07:00.000Z	Kaip		Ok. This is my first time on the Ubuntu Channel. I have a specific question about a certain wireless card's compatability. Can someone help me?
2007-03-20T14:07:00.000Z	Dabian	Kaip	: Get another card. :-P
2007-03-20T14:09:00.000Z	Dabian	Kaip	: Is it USB?
2007-03-20T14:12:00.000Z	Kaip	Dabian	(Ill just namedrop with the info) PCMCIA
2007-03-20T14:15:00.000Z	Kaip	Dabian	Any chance for a little feedback?
2007-03-20T14:16:00.000Z	Dabian	Kaip	: Lost track .. but I don't know much about PCMCIA .. save that some cards actually do work.  (Unlike USB, I guess .. where its really seldom).
2007-03-20T14:16:00.000Z	Kaip	Dabian	Yeah. Thats pretty much the answer i keep getting. Any recommendations on a 100% reliable card that will work with Ubuntu?
2007-03-20T14:17:00.000Z	Dabian	Kaip	: I asked about that before .. but didn't get an answer.
2007-03-20T14:17:00.000Z	Dabian	Kaip	: I know a girl who has a card that works though.
2007-03-20T14:17:00.000Z	Dabian	Kaip	: Lemme give her a call.
2007-03-20T14:17:00.000Z	Kaip	Dabian	Wow. That would be great :D
2007-03-20T14:17:00.000Z	Dabian	Kaip	: I doubt she's home / awake though.
2007-03-20T14:19:00.000Z	Dabian	Kaip	: She answered!
2007-03-20T14:19:00.000Z	Dabian	Kaip	: She is looking for it now.
2007-03-20T14:19:00.000Z	Kaip	Dabian	Thanks alot
2007-03-20T14:19:00.000Z	Dabian	Kaip	: "Orinoco" is the name of the card .. "PC-card"
2007-03-20T14:19:00.000Z	Dabian	Kaip	: Its also called "Silver card"
