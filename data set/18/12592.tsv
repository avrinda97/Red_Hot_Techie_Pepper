2006-06-19T09:50:00.000Z	twopeak		Can somebody help me removing Gaim? Even after doing a complete remove in Synaptic, Gaim is still in my Applications menu and works.
2006-06-19T09:50:00.000Z	Ng	twopeak	sudo apt-get remove gaim gaim-data
2006-06-19T09:50:00.000Z	twopeak	Ng	did that too. according to Synaptic Gaim is totally gone.
2006-06-19T09:51:00.000Z	Ng	twopeak	have you previously installed it manually from source or with third party packages?
2006-06-19T09:51:00.000Z	twopeak	Ng	I did compile it
2006-06-19T09:51:00.000Z	Ng	twopeak	then that'll be where it's coming from, go back to your source tree and do "sudo make uninstall"
2006-06-19T09:52:00.000Z	Ng	twopeak	things compiled by hand do not interact with synaptic/apt-get, so they won't know anything about them
2006-06-19T09:52:00.000Z	twopeak	Ng	how do i know my source tree?
2006-06-19T09:52:00.000Z	Ng	twopeak	by that I mean the directory you unpacked and did "./configure" and "make" in.
2006-06-19T09:53:00.000Z	twopeak	Ng	I'm afraid I've deleted that the moment the installation was successful.
2006-06-19T09:53:00.000Z	Ng	twopeak	oh well, you'll have to find and remove all the gaim files by hand then
2006-06-19T09:53:00.000Z	Ng	twopeak	try not to compile things from source unless you have to - it's a major pain ;)
2006-06-19T09:54:00.000Z	twopeak	Ng	I'm discovering that now. :(  How can I find all the files? the search function won't let me search elsewhere than my home directory
2006-06-19T09:54:00.000Z	Ng	twopeak	you could try "locate -i gaim"
2006-06-19T09:55:00.000Z	twopeak	Ng	that gave me a huge list of things. But maybe I'm better doing what Frogzoo said: redownload and then 'make uninstall'
2006-06-19T09:55:00.000Z	Ng	twopeak	it might work, but you may well have to build it first
2006-06-19T09:56:00.000Z	Ng	twopeak	do you remember if you passed a --prefix option to the ./configure script?
2006-06-19T09:56:00.000Z	twopeak	Ng	I'll try, if not I will remove what I got with the locate command. Thank you for helping me.
