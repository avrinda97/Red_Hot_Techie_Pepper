2005-08-04T05:18:00.000Z	RolandU		hi all
2005-08-04T05:19:00.000Z	RolandU		is it possible that ubuntu did not ask me to set up a root-password during install?
2005-08-04T05:19:00.000Z	holycow	RolandU	not only is it possible, there is no root pass in ubuntu
2005-08-04T05:19:00.000Z	holycow	RolandU	there is none, everything in ubuntu that is adminned requires sudo
2005-08-04T05:20:00.000Z	holycow		meaning you sudo command -options everythign
2005-08-04T05:20:00.000Z	RolandU	holycow	so, I can't do a console log in as root?
2005-08-04T05:20:00.000Z	holycow	RolandU	you can open up root console from sudo, or
2005-08-04T05:20:00.000Z	holycow	RolandU	you can set the root pass that will let you login to root shell
2005-08-04T05:21:00.000Z	holycow		i keep on seeing people say the 'downgraded' from breezy to hoary using synaptic ...
2005-08-04T05:21:00.000Z	holycow		is that really possible?
2005-08-04T05:21:00.000Z	holycow		i didn't think apt had that capability
2005-08-04T05:22:00.000Z	RolandU		oh, I have to enter my password to open the root-shell
2005-08-04T05:22:00.000Z	holycow		infact i remember a dev saying there is no way to do so at all
2005-08-04T05:22:00.000Z	holycow	RolandU	correct
2005-08-04T05:22:00.000Z	RolandU		are the packages in sarge that ubuntu does not offer?
2005-08-04T05:22:00.000Z	holycow	RolandU	basically the root pass is disabled to prevent noobs from accidentally running as root for obvious reasons
2005-08-04T05:22:00.000Z	holycow		precautionary thing, and it simplifies administration, i think osx does the same thing
2005-08-04T05:23:00.000Z	holycow	RolandU	no, its probably the other way around
