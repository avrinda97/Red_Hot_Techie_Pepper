2010-04-23T03:03:00.000Z	rocket16		Hello friends.
2010-04-23T03:05:00.000Z	rocket16		I just compiled a most basic PDF on common Ubuntu Tricks and Tips. I would be pleased to find any person here, who can make a review of the free-Book. Here is the Link to download: http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?mawgzzzzz3t Also, even if you are not willing to review, you are welcome to download and read this small PDF (26 Pages). All advice are welcome. (Sorry if I might have been offropic).
