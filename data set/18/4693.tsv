2009-03-02T10:43:00.000Z	mezy		how can i tell which device file is corresponding to a usb drive?
2009-03-02T10:43:00.000Z	mezy		great, i dont even know what im talking about
2009-03-02T10:45:00.000Z	mezy		i wish i knew where the fstab is, and what it is. im still struggling with most of this stuff, and hit a road block on that tutorial
2009-03-02T10:47:00.000Z	mezy		uhm. command not found?
2009-03-02T10:48:00.000Z	mezy		found it
2009-03-02T10:49:00.000Z	mezy		hmm. so much for that, now im stuck on the tutorial
2009-03-02T10:51:00.000Z	mezy		hmm
2009-03-02T10:51:00.000Z	nanotube	mezy	run command "sudo fdisk -l" (that's a lower case L), that will list all the partitions.
2009-03-02T10:51:00.000Z	mezy		thanks
2009-03-02T10:52:00.000Z	nanotube	mezy	you could also try command "mount", which will list all mounted partitions (but will include some non-disk virtual partitions as well)
2009-03-02T10:52:00.000Z	nanotube	mezy	and will not include anything that's not mounted (while fdisk will)
2009-03-02T10:54:00.000Z	mezy	nanotube	thanks. so as for a usb, fdisk is telling me that /dev/sdb is the corresponding file for my usb drive, right?
2009-03-02T10:55:00.000Z	nanotube	mezy	well, i don't know what it is telling you, because i don't see the output... :) but that sounds reasonable
2009-03-02T10:55:00.000Z	mezy		lol
2009-03-02T10:56:00.000Z	mezy	nanotube	it looks good on my side. i think, lol
2009-03-02T10:56:00.000Z	nanotube	mezy	ok good. :)
2009-03-02T10:58:00.000Z	mezy	nanotube	just to let you know, im following a tutorial. right now, im at the part where im about to 'repartition my usb drive'
2009-03-02T11:00:00.000Z	nanotube	mezy	ah, i see. :) well, i would suggest you mount it first, and make sure that its contents are what you think they are, before you do any actual repartitioning. :)
