2011-03-02T21:00:00.000Z	Avasz		can we compile the drivers in one pc and move it to another? is it possible?
2011-03-02T21:00:00.000Z	ikonia	Avasz	sure is
2011-03-02T21:01:00.000Z	Avasz	ikonia	how?
2011-03-02T21:01:00.000Z	ikonia	Avasz	just that, compile on one machine, pickup the kernel module, and move it to your other machine
2011-03-02T21:01:00.000Z	Avasz	ikonia	if the module and distro are different then?
2011-03-02T21:02:00.000Z	ikonia	Avasz	then no
2011-03-02T21:02:00.000Z	ikonia	Avasz	that is not wise
2011-03-02T21:02:00.000Z	Avasz	ikonia	but.. isnt it that the driver is same file?
2011-03-02T21:03:00.000Z	ikonia	Avasz	yes, it will build the same end result, but against different headers,
2011-03-02T21:04:00.000Z	Avasz	ikonia	ok. thanks. was having some problems in debian... and was thinking to compile from ubuntu and move it there. but wont do it now.
2011-03-11T18:55:00.000Z	ikonia	Avasz	drag and drop is not a feature you disable, it's part of the desktop
2011-03-11T18:55:00.000Z	Avasz	ikonia	but this is irritating me... or.. can it be driver issue too?
2011-03-11T18:55:00.000Z	ikonia	Avasz	wht is irritating to you ?
2011-03-11T18:56:00.000Z	Avasz	ikonia	this is something like drag and drop.. it tries to drag and drop anything i click.. hyperlinks.. icons.. etc etc.
2011-03-11T18:56:00.000Z	ikonia	Avasz	don't drag and drop then
2011-03-11T18:57:00.000Z	Avasz	ikonia	can it be related to my touchpad/eraser head drivers?
2011-03-11T18:57:00.000Z	ikonia	Avasz	I have no idea
2011-03-11T18:57:00.000Z	Avasz	ikonia	no. i dont drag and drop.. it just does it.. whatever i click.
