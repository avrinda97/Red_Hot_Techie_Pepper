2009-08-30T22:08:00.000Z	vigo	gangsta	Try computerhope.com, is a website with lots of info and data on startup or boot options or whatever.
2009-08-30T22:09:00.000Z	gangsta	vigo	i have setup everything, but i have no idea why my pc keeps on forgetting about it:)
2009-08-30T22:10:00.000Z	vigo	gangsta	I had to replace a CMOS battery for that, but it varies with each box.
2009-08-30T22:11:00.000Z	vigo	gangsta	You can easily make a Boot Disk that overrides the CMOS/BIOS settings and runs the way you wish it to.
2009-08-30T22:11:00.000Z	gangsta	vigo	how?
2009-08-30T22:12:00.000Z	vigo	gangsta	Look at bootdisk,com or look at FreeDOS.
2009-08-30T22:13:00.000Z	gangsta	vigo	what should i do with that?
2009-08-30T22:15:00.000Z	vigo	gangsta	Basically you are making a Bootable device, floppy,USB,CD or whatever, but is a bit more than basic, is more like a BeOS or BSD startup.
2009-08-30T22:16:00.000Z	gangsta	vigo	what could i do with it though?
2009-08-30T22:16:00.000Z	vigo	gangsta	Does your box have a floppy?
2009-08-30T22:17:00.000Z	gangsta	vigo	yes!
2009-08-30T22:17:00.000Z	gangsta	vigo	wait!!! antix has started booting up!!:)
2009-08-30T22:18:00.000Z	vigo	gangsta	we have liftoff?
2009-08-30T22:18:00.000Z	vigo	gangsta	http://www.bootdisk.com/readme.htm <<that explains it better than I can in this medium.

2009-08-30T22:20:00.000Z	vigo	gangsta	Than I am a happy man and I am going fishing now!
