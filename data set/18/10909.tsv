2007-08-23T15:46:00.000Z	Pelo	tarelerulz	 should work for all of them ,  but totem doesn't work well with dvd,  try mplayer vlc or xine

2007-10-09T08:59:00.000Z	Pelo	tarelerulz	 what makes you ask why I suggested that ?
2007-10-09T08:59:00.000Z	tarelerulz	Pelo	, that never came to me at all. I really need to read up on bit torrent and networking in general .  So much to know a bit
2007-10-09T08:59:00.000Z	Pelo	tarelerulz	I use to do quite a bit of support in #utorrent and #azureus and I wrote a few guides for utorrent ,  I have a bit of knowledge in torrent
2007-10-09T09:01:00.000Z	tarelerulz	Pelo	I have been doing it for years ,but I did it on windows and I did not know much more then forwarding.   Now there is so much to know .  I wondering if it was the program I am use or router or the site
2007-11-23T06:47:00.000Z	Pelo	tarelerulz	 32bit
2007-11-23T06:49:00.000Z	Pelo	tarelerulz	 conventionnal wisedom here is that unless you have an specific use for 64 bit version ( like special apps)  use the 32 bit one,  64 bit is still missing some driver support for stuff like nvidia and ati and some wifi , and no flash
2008-04-04T05:57:00.000Z	Pelo	tarelerulz	try asking in #deluge
