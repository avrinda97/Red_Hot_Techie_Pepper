2007-08-22T16:37:00.000Z	kornits		i need to install it first in order to do that part HighNo
2007-08-22T16:39:00.000Z	kornits		:-\
2007-08-22T16:39:00.000Z	kornits		oops
2007-08-22T16:40:00.000Z	kornits		hld on i'll lookl
2007-08-22T16:40:00.000Z	kornits		Linux ben.bfit.edu 2.6.20-16-generic #2 SMP Thu Jun 7 20:19:32 UTC 2007 i686 GNU/Linux
2007-08-22T16:41:00.000Z	kornits		ben.bfit.edu... it used to say mailserver but i changed it to that
2007-08-22T16:42:00.000Z	kornits		thinking that might be the issue
2007-08-22T16:42:00.000Z	kornits		it's just something i through in there as a host name
2007-08-22T16:44:00.000Z	kornits		after i changed the hostname the error message read "  The value of variable $myhostname is "", but should have been a fully qualified domain name; "
2007-08-22T16:44:00.000Z	stefg	kornits	man hostname
2007-08-22T16:46:00.000Z	kornits	stefg	i know how to change the hostname, as i have done it many times, reading the manual doesn't help in this case as it seems to be an issue with installing amavisd-new
2007-08-22T16:46:00.000Z	stefg	kornits	so your first check should be if the hostnam in /etc/hosts and /etc/hostname correspond
2007-08-22T16:48:00.000Z	kornits	stefg	they do not correspond
2007-08-22T16:48:00.000Z	stefg	kornits	that's bad
2007-08-22T16:48:00.000Z	kornits	stefg	how can i fix it
2007-08-22T16:48:00.000Z	stefg	kornits	just edit them to be the same
2007-08-22T16:49:00.000Z	kornits	stefg	there are two listings for my loopback IP, one says "localhost" the other says "mailserver" (which was the old hostname until i changed it) do i need to change both or just one?
2007-08-22T16:50:00.000Z	stefg	kornits	remove the old hostname... see what i mean? That's what the hostname command is for
