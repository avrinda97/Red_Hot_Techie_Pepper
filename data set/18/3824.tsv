2012-05-25T12:39:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	CptK00k	you are not the only person in here getting help. please be patient and allow others that were here before you to be helped
2012-05-25T12:40:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	CptK00k	in the mean time, try holding Ctrl and using the scrollwheel on your mouse, that's a fairly universal scroll shortcut for browsers
2012-05-25T12:41:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	CptK00k	try scrolling the other way...?
2012-05-25T12:48:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	CptK00k	samuel is right. bluefish is a fairly obscure browser on ubuntu, so you probably wont' find many people in here that have used it
2012-05-25T12:49:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	CptK00k	their developers should be able to assist you though
2012-05-25T12:50:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	CptK00k	there are TONS of browsers. firefox is the default. what features are you looking for (other than zooming)
2012-05-25T12:51:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	CptK00k	OH, that bluefish!
2012-05-25T12:51:00.000Z	DarwinSurvivor	CptK00k	hmm, for zooming in there, you'll probably have to go through the menus or something
