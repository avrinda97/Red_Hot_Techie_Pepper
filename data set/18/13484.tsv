2005-12-12T16:42:00.000Z	Debian		Hi i created a user on my ubuntu box.. how can i limit the privileges to that user?
2005-12-12T16:42:00.000Z	Debian		make him only read ?
2005-12-12T16:43:00.000Z	erUSUL	Debian	read what
2005-12-12T16:44:00.000Z	erUSUL	Debian	a normal user can only write in /tmp and her home
2005-12-12T16:44:00.000Z	Debian	erUSUL	only has access to read the files in his /home folder
2005-12-12T16:44:00.000Z	Debian	erUSUL	could he see the other users folderS/
2005-12-12T16:44:00.000Z	erUSUL	Debian	this is not possible
2005-12-12T16:44:00.000Z	Debian	erUSUL	okay thanks.
2005-12-12T16:45:00.000Z	erUSUL	Debian	it depends on how the owners of the folders has set up his permissions
2005-12-13T17:04:00.000Z	erUSUL	Debian	if you want to make sure that only you caqn see your files do chmod -R 700 $HOME
2005-12-13T17:05:00.000Z	erUSUL	Debian	and then add umask=077 to your .bashrc
2005-12-13T17:06:00.000Z	Debian	erUSUL	whats the .bashrc :/
2005-12-13T17:07:00.000Z	erUSUL	Debian	it is a file for configuring the comand line (bash)
2005-12-13T17:07:00.000Z	erUSUL	Debian	setting the umask makes all your new files get the restrictive permisions
2005-12-13T17:08:00.000Z	Debian	erUSUL	im in the file.. where do i actually put it?
2005-12-13T17:09:00.000Z	erUSUL	Debian	whatever you like the line should read 'export umask=077'
2005-12-13T17:10:00.000Z	erUSUL	Debian	with export
2005-12-13T17:12:00.000Z	erUSUL	Debian	i was mistaken use a line like this 'umask 077'
