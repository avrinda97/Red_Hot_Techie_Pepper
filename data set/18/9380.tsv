2007-04-14T13:14:00.000Z	adaptr	tiraeth	what do you mean by a "Windows Domain" ?
2007-04-14T13:15:00.000Z	tiraeth	adaptr	i'm working in group GRUPAR both in Windows and Ubuntu. On Windows (PC2) i want to print on shared printer on PC1. But Windows doesn't see this printer :/
2007-04-14T13:15:00.000Z	adaptr	tiraeth	so you don't actually have a domain ?
2007-04-14T13:17:00.000Z	tiraeth	adaptr	"Add printer" in Windows shows me my Ubuntu PC, but there is no printer to select
2007-04-14T13:17:00.000Z	adaptr	tiraeth	have you made it public ?
2007-04-14T13:17:00.000Z	tiraeth	adaptr	don't know how :/
2007-04-14T13:18:00.000Z	adaptr	tiraeth	by configuring samba properly, of course
2007-04-14T13:18:00.000Z	adaptr	tiraeth	how did you configure your printer in samba ?
2007-04-14T13:18:00.000Z	tiraeth	adaptr	i didn't :P i tried to edit some variables in samba conf file
2007-04-14T13:19:00.000Z	tiraeth	adaptr	printing=caps and printcap name = cups uncommented... only this
2007-04-14T13:19:00.000Z	adaptr	tiraeth	so you don't have a printer at all yet
2007-04-14T13:20:00.000Z	adaptr	tiraeth	and you entered what in the printers section ?
2007-04-14T13:20:00.000Z	tiraeth	adaptr	browseable=no; should i change it to yes?
2007-04-14T13:20:00.000Z	adaptr	tiraeth	where is that ?
2007-04-14T13:21:00.000Z	tiraeth	adaptr	/etc/samba/smb.conf of course
2007-04-14T13:21:00.000Z	tiraeth	adaptr	and public is "no" too :/
2007-04-14T13:21:00.000Z	tiraeth	adaptr	i'll try to google for info
2007-04-14T13:22:00.000Z	adaptr	tiraeth	browsable means just what you might think; public means anybody may print
