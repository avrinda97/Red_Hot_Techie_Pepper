2006-06-08T09:03:00.000Z	AlwaysIcey	Ar2No	you need to add DNS Servers to that.  I'll see if I can get the lines for you.  (May be a few minutes).  I'm going to assume that the DNS server will be the same as your gateway (if you're on DSL or cable).
2006-06-08T09:05:00.000Z	AlwaysIcey	Ar2No	add "dns-nameservers 192.168.1.250" (without the quotes) to the end of the interfaces file.

2006-06-08T10:21:00.000Z	AlwaysIcey	Ar2No	you may want to look for a file called resolve.conf and add them in there also.  I'll see if I can get into mine, and get you the proper line for that file.
