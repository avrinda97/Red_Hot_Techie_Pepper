2011-12-08T11:21:00.000Z	Jordan_U	kimp	How did you try to re-install grub?
2011-12-08T11:27:00.000Z	kimp	Jordan_U	I created a Boot Repair disk
2011-12-08T11:28:00.000Z	Jordan_U	kimp	Can you be more specific and detailed?
2011-12-08T11:30:00.000Z	Jordan_U	kimp	If you're still having problems that is.
2011-12-08T11:30:00.000Z	kimp	Jordan_U	I followed the ubuntu instructions to download Boot Repair iso from sourceforge.  Booted from CD and let it interrogate my system.  Selected the 'Recommended Repairs' option.  It runs for a while then gets stuck...
2011-12-08T11:33:00.000Z	Jordan_U	kimp	Follow these instructions instead: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2#ChRoot
2011-12-08T11:35:00.000Z	kimp	Jordan_U	- I just tried reinstall Ubuntu but it to hangs!  Do you still think I should try the chroot option?
2011-12-08T11:36:00.000Z	Jordan_U	kimp	Where did it hang?
2011-12-08T11:37:00.000Z	Jordan_U	kimp	Are you using the Live or alternate CD?
2011-12-08T11:40:00.000Z	kimp	Jordan_U	I had 3 partitions before I installed Ubuntu.  From what I saw in the GRUB Rescue, I think I now have 5.  Should the install create 2 partitions?  And does it know that only one can be primary?
2011-12-08T11:42:00.000Z	Jordan_U	kimp	Yes (root filesystem and swap) and yes (it will have created an extended partition and made logical partitions within that for root and swap).
2011-12-08T11:42:00.000Z	Jordan_U	kimp	Can you post a screenshot of where it's hung?
2011-12-08T11:43:00.000Z	kimp	Jordan_U	ubottu - I just rebooted it.  I can try again, however not sure how I will be able to get screen shot of the machine?
2011-12-08T11:45:00.000Z	Jordan_U	kimp	If you choose "Try Ubuntu before installing" (or something similar) then you can run other applications in addition to the installer (which will be an icon on the Desktop).
2011-12-08T11:52:00.000Z	Jordan_U	kimp	ubottu is a bot :)
2011-12-08T11:52:00.000Z	kimp	Jordan_U	- That's hilarious :)
2011-12-08T12:01:00.000Z	kimp	Jordan_U	I can't save the image to a thumb drive.  The system can see the thumb, but can't open it...  Sames goes for all drives, actually, except for one called File System (which I suspect is the CD ROM?)
2011-12-08T12:25:00.000Z	kimp	Jordan_U	I tried the ChRoot method.  It hung again, this time when I went sudo chroot /mnt
