2012-10-20T17:19:00.000Z	blacksheep__	dArKd3ViL	tell me, how did you install the icon in the 1st place .. I can't seem to be able to install webapps
2012-10-20T17:20:00.000Z	dArKd3ViL	blacksheep__	you need firefox installed
2012-10-20T17:21:00.000Z	dArKd3ViL		blacksheep__:after that, go to preferences>general tab
2012-10-20T17:22:00.000Z	dArKd3ViL	blacksheep__	make sure the "Prompt integration option for any website" is checked
2012-10-20T17:23:00.000Z	dArKd3ViL	blacksheep__	then just visit gmail/facebook.. and a lil notification popup will appear asking whether you want to install the particular web app for the site, hit install if you want to
2012-10-20T17:24:00.000Z	blacksheep__	dArKd3ViL	there is no such option in the preferences window ... I think the fact I didn't have firefox installed during the upgrade was the issue ... should I maybe try re-installing some packages ?
2012-10-20T17:26:00.000Z	dArKd3ViL	blacksheep__	if you have firefox installed and not getting the option; then do 2 things:
2012-10-20T17:27:00.000Z	blacksheep__	dArKd3ViL	I think I will try removing and installing this "ubofox" integration package ... it doesn't say anything about webapps integration, but it might just work
2012-10-20T17:27:00.000Z	dArKd3ViL		blacksheep__:1. check whether your firefox is the latest version.. 16.0.1
2012-10-20T17:27:00.000Z	blacksheep__	dArKd3ViL	the odd thing is that I did have Chromium installed, and it says Chromium supports ubuntu webapps, so it should have worked there ...
2012-10-20T17:28:00.000Z	dArKd3ViL		blacksheep__:2.  sudo apt-get install unity-webapps-service
2012-10-20T17:28:00.000Z	blacksheep__	dArKd3ViL	yes, it is 16.0.1
2012-10-20T17:28:00.000Z	blacksheep__	dArKd3ViL	from help->about
2012-10-20T17:28:00.000Z	dArKd3ViL	blacksheep__	yes, chromium works too; just step 2
2012-10-20T17:29:00.000Z	blacksheep__	dArKd3ViL	it says the package is already installed ... Argh, I really wanted to try the webapps thing :X
2012-10-20T17:30:00.000Z	blacksheep__		should i remove & install again?
2012-10-20T17:31:00.000Z	dArKd3ViL	blacksheep__	then, a workaround is, if you want it really bad, goto software-center and search with a query, "unity-webapps" and you shall get all the webapps list you can download
