2009-04-29T02:43:00.000Z	lukavia		hi, i have xmms running but not listed in my Aplications menu
2009-04-29T02:43:00.000Z	lukavia		does anybody seen the problem
2009-04-29T02:44:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	lukavia	xmms2? that's a daemon now, you need a frontend for it. try audacity if you're looking for a winamp clone
2009-04-29T02:50:00.000Z	lukavia	Seven_Six_Two	xmms1 :)
2009-04-29T02:52:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	lukavia	oh I thought that was superseded by audacious
2009-04-29T02:52:00.000Z	lukavia	Seven_Six_Two	i don't know waht superseded means but .....
2009-04-29T02:53:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	lukavia	ok. what part of xmms do you want?
2009-04-29T02:56:00.000Z	lukavia	Seven_Six_Two	part 1
2009-04-29T02:56:00.000Z	lukavia	Seven_Six_Two	aka xmms
2009-04-29T02:57:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	lukavia	so the name is more important than the features?
2009-04-29T02:58:00.000Z	lukavia	Seven_Six_Two	not the name, the habits :)
2009-04-29T02:58:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	lukavia	xmms1 is legacy. From that code came Beep Media Player and from Beep came Audacious. If you want it to be called xmms, then download the source from the xmms site and build it yourself.
2009-04-29T02:59:00.000Z	lukavia	Seven_Six_Two	tried that
2009-04-29T02:59:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	lukavia	if you're looking for something that looks and feels like xmms, then again....   AUDACIOUS
2009-04-29T03:00:00.000Z	lukavia	Seven_Six_Two	i try to have xmms, that is all, if you don't have wishes to help me that is understandable
2009-04-29T03:01:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	lukavia	fair enough. I've used xmms too, and like it, but I don't see the difference except in the name
2009-04-29T03:02:00.000Z	lukavia	Seven_Six_Two	fair enough, thank you for your cooperation
2009-04-29T03:03:00.000Z	Seven_Six_Two	lukavia	have you pastebinned the output from your attempt at compiling it?
