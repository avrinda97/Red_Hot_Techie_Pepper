2008-02-28T20:45:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Bo^Dick	I do like dd for imaging partitions.. increase the buffer size to speed it up.
2008-02-28T20:46:00.000Z	Bo^Dick	Jack_Sparrow	the problem is that i've got a lot of free space on the drive

2008-02-28T20:50:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Bo^Dick	See also g4l   ghost4linux
2008-02-28T21:35:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Bo^Dick	 What link did you use to get that?
2008-02-28T21:40:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Bo^Dick	I use dd to copy and restore the mbr with and without the partition info
2008-02-28T21:40:00.000Z	Bo^Dick	Jack_Sparrow	let me guess, you make a raw image with dd and then use zip to compress it?
2008-02-28T21:41:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Bo^Dick	No need to compress 512 bytes
2008-02-28T21:41:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Bo^Dick	or 446 etc without partition info
2008-02-28T21:41:00.000Z	Bo^Dick	Jack_Sparrow	yeah but for the whole drive i mean (not just mbr)
2008-02-28T21:42:00.000Z	Bo^Dick	Jack_Sparrow	i've been told dd doesn't compress empty space
2008-02-28T21:43:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Bo^Dick	I was pointing out some of the possibilities..  I need to run...  dd can be piped to gzip per the link I gave earlier for a comp[ressed image, but junk that is not zeroed out will show up as data.. true
2008-03-15T18:08:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Bo^Dick	His problems are not with linux or ubuntu.. they start with wubi
2008-03-15T18:10:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Bo^Dick	 Wubi uses a file to simulate a drive structure etc..   tries to contain it like that
2008-03-15T18:16:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Bo^Dick	Should already have one
2008-03-15T18:16:00.000Z	Bo^Dick	Jack_Sparrow	thanks
2008-03-15T18:17:00.000Z	Jack_Sparrow	Bo^Dick	also most likely need kernel-headers for your specific  uname -a   kernel
2008-03-15T18:18:00.000Z	Bo^Dick	Jack_Sparrow	ok
