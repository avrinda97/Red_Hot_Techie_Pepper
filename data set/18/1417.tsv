2011-02-25T19:40:00.000Z	sicopath		What do I have to do in order to run a program automatically when i login? (from a console)
2011-02-25T19:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sicopath	 the .bashrc or .profile is the place to set specic variables and so forth.
2011-02-25T19:41:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sicopath	 depends on what you are running exactly
2011-02-25T19:42:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sicopath	 that would best be done from /etc/rc.local
2011-02-25T19:52:00.000Z	sicopath	Dr_Willis	thanks.  The script runs.  Now it requires input.  Could you guide me again?
2011-02-25T20:05:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sicopath	 theres some in /etc/ or if you knew the proper commands you could run them from /etc/rc.local
2011-02-25T20:06:00.000Z	sicopath	Dr_Willis	how can I view the /root folder of this filesystem on the SD card.
2011-02-25T20:07:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sicopath	 look on the card.. see whats what..  if you mean the 'root' users home  that would be under 'root'     the / is also called the root of the filesystem.
2011-02-25T20:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sicopath	 apt-get has a -y option i belive. or some similer 'yes' option
2011-02-25T20:08:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sicopath	 '/root' would be the root users home directory.. the path is.. /root/
2011-02-25T20:14:00.000Z	sicopath	Dr_Willis	so let's say I add a 'apt-get install X'.  How in the script can I make it press "Y" to continue?
2011-02-25T20:14:00.000Z	sicopath	Dr_Willis	I added that to /etc/rc.local
2011-02-25T20:14:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sicopath	 that would be very weird running apt-get from rc.local
2011-02-25T20:14:00.000Z	sicopath	Dr_Willis	i'm in a weird spot :)
2011-02-25T20:36:00.000Z	sicopath	Dr_Willis	last question, I promise.  Could I just use vmware server on Ubuntu(x64).  Use this to emulate ppc and run the SD card?
2011-02-25T23:20:00.000Z	sicopath	Dr_Willis	llutz : just wanted to let you both know I figured out my problem and all is working.  Thanks for your help!
2011-02-25T23:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sicopath	 i dont even rember the problem. :)
2011-02-25T23:21:00.000Z	Dr_Willis	sicopath	 commands in rc.local did the trick?
