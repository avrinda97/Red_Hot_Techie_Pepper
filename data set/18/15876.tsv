2005-01-11T11:22:00.000Z	nicedreams		snow crash?  is that a program?
2005-01-11T11:23:00.000Z	nicedreams		oh a book
2005-01-11T11:23:00.000Z	nicedreams		i can't read
2005-01-11T11:23:00.000Z	nicedreams		i'm too add and adhd for reading
2005-01-11T11:23:00.000Z	nicedreams		i wish i could
2005-01-11T11:24:00.000Z	nicedreams		i end up reading a paragraph, then be in my own world and then find out that i read 10 pages, but don't know what i read
2005-01-11T11:24:00.000Z	sunjoy	nicedreams	what's ad_h_d
2005-01-11T11:24:00.000Z	sunjoy	nicedreams	hyperactivity?
2005-01-11T11:25:00.000Z	sunjoy	nicedreams	so if you have a fast flow of information at you, does it help you focus?
2005-01-11T11:26:00.000Z	sunjoy	nicedreams	hmm... ever tried an audio book speeded up?  I know blind folks will listen to their books so fast that I have a hard time understanding
2005-01-11T11:29:00.000Z	sunjoy	nicedreams	cool.  it's good when people can find a niche for a trait like that
2005-01-11T11:42:00.000Z	sunjoy	nicedreams	how to get a source package with aptitude?  And I felt the same as you about aptitude till I started using synaptic -- it's quite good.
2005-01-11T11:43:00.000Z	nicedreams	sunjoy	i'm looking...i forgot
2005-01-11T11:47:00.000Z	nicedreams	sunjoy	 I can't find how to download a source package...  i know it's there though.  Try 'smartpm' if you like Synaptic.  It's a little easier to use I think, and it manages repositories for RPM,Slack,URPMI,DEB,APT,blablabla
2005-01-11T11:51:00.000Z	sunjoy	nicedreams	well, nowadays you can use apt-get (and possibly aptitude) with fedora (to mange rpms)
2005-01-11T11:52:00.000Z	sunjoy	nicedreams	but i'll check out smartpm
2005-01-11T11:59:00.000Z	sunjoy	nicedreams	blah.  that's like openbsd or something. vi is annoying when you're used to vim
