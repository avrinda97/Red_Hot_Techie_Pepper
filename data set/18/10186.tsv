2007-05-16T16:24:00.000Z	blind		Okay, I need some help. Whenever I boot my computer with my webcam plugged in, I can't operate my webcam. When I unplug it, khubd runs my computer up to 100% cpu usage, and i have no usb usage. How can I fix this?
2007-05-16T16:24:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	blind	It sounds as if your webcam model isn't properly supported
2007-05-16T16:25:00.000Z	blind	IntuitiveNipple	when I plug it in after my computer's turned on, it operates fine.
2007-05-16T16:26:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	blind	Hmm, sounds like a driver issue then... have you checked with the maintainers of the webcam drivers?
2007-05-16T16:27:00.000Z	blind	IntuitiveNipple	no, I haven't. I just plugged it in when I got it, and it worked so i didn't question it. im not even sure who makes the drivers
2007-05-16T16:28:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	blind	Best thing to do is "lshw" and look for your webcam. There you'll find a line for each device that reads "configuration: driver=XXXXXX". Search for XXXXX on Google and you should be able to trace the driver writers
2007-05-16T16:28:00.000Z	blind	IntuitiveNipple	thanks
2007-05-16T16:29:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	blind	Or you could just search Google for "linux" and the webcam model
2007-05-16T16:29:00.000Z	blind		that would probably work better, seeing as how my webcam isn't recognized right now.
2007-05-16T16:29:00.000Z	blind		god, i really don't feel like rebooting lol.
2007-05-16T16:30:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	blind	why do you need to reboot?
2007-05-16T16:31:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	blind	Can't you unload the driver manually?
2007-05-16T16:31:00.000Z	blind	IntuitiveNipple	i don't know. can i?
2007-05-16T16:31:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	blind	If the reason to reboot is to kill the driver, I would think so :)
2007-05-16T16:32:00.000Z	blind	IntuitiveNipple	how? :] 
2007-05-16T16:32:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	blind	sudo modprobe -r XXXXXX
2007-05-16T16:32:00.000Z	blind	IntuitiveNipple	how do i find the module name?
2007-05-16T16:33:00.000Z	IntuitiveNipple	blind	Refer to my previous comment about using lshw :)
