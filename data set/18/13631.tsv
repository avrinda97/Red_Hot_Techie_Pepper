2006-07-07T16:38:00.000Z	kevinz		hello, i guess ubuntu choose a wrong soundcard driver for me. where can i change it?
2006-07-07T16:38:00.000Z	Tomcat__	kevinz	System => Prefs => Sound (bottom)
2006-07-07T16:38:00.000Z	Tomcat__	kevinz	Eh... sorry, misread that.
2006-07-07T16:39:00.000Z	Tomcat__	kevinz	How did you find out it uses the wrong driver? That shouldn't happen usually... :o
2006-07-07T16:40:00.000Z	kevinz	Tomcat__	thank you for replying. I am using laptop and i check some wiki and see the suggested driver is AC97 but the one in used is ICH6
2006-07-07T16:41:00.000Z	Tomcat__	kevinz	And sound does not work?
2006-07-07T16:42:00.000Z	kevinz	Tomcat__	sound is working, that's weird, because the music or whatever, even the login sound, is not nice. and i can't find soundcard information from lspci or dmesg
2006-07-07T16:43:00.000Z	Tomcat__	kevinz	I highly doubt it's a wrong driver problem (Ubuntu loads drivers using the unique card IDs), rather a config problem...
2006-07-07T16:44:00.000Z	kevinz	Tomcat__	oh. so why can't i see my soundcard in lspci , and what can i do now?
2006-07-07T16:44:00.000Z	Tomcat__	kevinz	Well, you could describe what's wrong with the sound....
2006-07-07T16:45:00.000Z	Tomcat__	kevinz	I don't know why you can't see it in lspci... I can. :)
2006-07-07T16:47:00.000Z	kevinz	Tomcat__	oh i am sorry, i find it now. well the sound is kind of smother, if i use this word right.
2006-07-07T16:47:00.000Z	Tomcat__	kevinz	Well, don't really know about that... but it really sounds like a config problem. Maybe ask the forums, or wait if somebody here knows.
2006-07-07T16:48:00.000Z	kevinz	Tomcat__	oh so there is config for sound right?
2006-07-07T16:48:00.000Z	Tomcat__	kevinz	There is a config for almost anything...
2006-07-07T16:49:00.000Z	kevinz	Tomcat__	oh yeah... so may i have a clue about the config part?.. i was searching for the problem blindly..
2006-07-07T16:50:00.000Z	Tomcat__	kevinz	Well there's the esd config... alsa config... and so on. No idea what exactly you want, because I have no idea what's the problem.
2006-07-07T16:52:00.000Z	kevinz	Tomcat__	i see. this problem just can't be described but i cannot enjoy music either.. thank you very much.
