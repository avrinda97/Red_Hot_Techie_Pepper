2009-01-16T23:46:00.000Z	JC_Denton_		is there a command to set the dns server(s)?
2009-01-16T23:48:00.000Z	Solver	JC_Denton_	your local dns servers are defined in /etc/resolv.conf
2009-01-16T23:49:00.000Z	JC_Denton_	Solver	 thanks
2009-01-16T23:50:00.000Z	Solver	JC_Denton_	NP.  DHCP normally sets them for you, if that is relevant
2009-01-16T23:51:00.000Z	JC_Denton_	Solver	 I was aware but the local dns server is unreliable
2009-01-16T23:51:00.000Z	Solver	JC_Denton_	ah :)  dhcp will try to over-write them for you later. that can be stopped
2009-01-16T23:51:00.000Z	Solver	JC_Denton_	one per line preceded by the word nameserver
2009-01-16T23:53:00.000Z	JC_Denton_	Solver	how would you stop dhcp from modifying the file?
2009-01-16T23:53:00.000Z	Solver	JC_Denton_	if you are using dhclient which is likely you can edit /etc/dhcp3/dhclient.conf and tell it not to update nameservers
2009-01-16T23:53:00.000Z	Solver	JC_Denton_	there is a more drastic way :)
2009-01-16T23:54:00.000Z	JC_Denton_	Solver	that sounds like just the solution, the former
2009-01-16T23:54:00.000Z	Solver	JC_Denton_	it is preferable
2009-01-16T23:54:00.000Z	Solver	JC_Denton_	know about how to set and clear immutability is useful though
2009-01-16T23:54:00.000Z	Solver	JC_Denton_	useful for stoopid closed source apps that over-write files
2009-01-16T23:55:00.000Z	Solver	JC_Denton_	man chattr & lsattr if you want to read about it
2009-01-16T23:56:00.000Z	JC_Denton_	Solver	thanks, will do. Every bit of knowledge comes in handy...
2009-01-16T23:56:00.000Z	Solver	JC_Denton_	for sure.  chattr/lsattr are hardly know but they are useful
2009-01-16T23:57:00.000Z	Solver	JC_Denton_	np.  good luck :)
