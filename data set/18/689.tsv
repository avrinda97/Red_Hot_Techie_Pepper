2011-10-23T13:43:00.000Z	ekakela		I have a small problem with ubuntu server 10.11 installer. The Partitioning tool shows only the scsi volumes, but I have one sata volume hanging around too and it allways tries to put mbr there during installation. I'd like to have the whole installation on those SCSI volumes, any neat trick to make it happen? :D
2011-10-23T13:44:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	ekakela	It should ask you where you want to install GRUB at the end.
2011-10-23T13:48:00.000Z	ekakela	KatsumeBlisk	Atleast with normal installation mode it doesn't, trying with the expert mode now
2011-10-23T13:49:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	ekakela	I've never tried the 11.10 one, I use the LTS for servers, but at the end it asks if those were the detected OSes and do you want to install GRUB. If you hit no, I think you'll choose what partition or disk to install it to. It's been a while, so i don't remember fully.

2011-10-23T13:50:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	ekakela	No problem. Hopefully, that fixes it.
2011-10-23T14:20:00.000Z	ekakela	KatsumeBlisk	Funny, thanks to you I got it finally to boot but now it halts on "Stopping read required files in advance"
2011-10-23T14:20:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	ekakela	This is after the install?
2011-10-23T14:21:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	ekakela	I don't know. Sorry.
2011-10-23T14:22:00.000Z	ekakela	KatsumeBlisk	Actually the system works :D Just had to switch to another tty to see anything usefull :D
2011-10-23T14:23:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	ekakela	Awesome! :D
2011-10-23T14:26:00.000Z	ekakela	KatsumeBlisk	Now I'm just wondering why my user doesn't have sudo privs :D Next time remember to allow root login
2011-10-23T14:26:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	ekakela	Can't you log in as root?
2011-10-23T14:27:00.000Z	ekakela	KatsumeBlisk	Nope because did installation in expert mode and when it asked "allow root login" I answered no, since with standard installation you don't have to use root account for anything
2011-10-23T14:27:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	ekakela	Ouch. You need it to install stuff. XX
2011-10-23T14:27:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	ekakela	Especially since you just reinstalled it, you don't lose anything
2011-10-23T14:28:00.000Z	ekakela	KatsumeBlisk	sudo privs will do as well but it seems that the installer didn't give them to the default user it makes in expert mode :D
2011-10-23T14:28:00.000Z	KatsumeBlisk	ekakela	I've never used expert, so I don't know what it does.
