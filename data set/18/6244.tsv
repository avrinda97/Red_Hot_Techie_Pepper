2008-10-13T21:01:00.000Z	r0ach		Is 8.10 ready for personal use ?
2008-10-13T21:01:00.000Z	r0ach		I see
2008-10-13T21:01:00.000Z	r0ach		My friend said - "Wait for the finished product. Don't waste ur bandwidth on the beta"
2008-10-13T21:02:00.000Z	r0ach		So I guess thats good advice. Is it ?
2008-10-13T21:03:00.000Z	r0ach		I see
2008-10-13T21:03:00.000Z	r0ach		I can't wait till it releases
2008-10-13T21:03:00.000Z	r0ach		Windows is a pain in the ass
2008-10-13T21:04:00.000Z	r0ach		If anyone is already using it, please tell me if Intrepid has got a speed boost or something
2008-10-13T21:04:00.000Z	r0ach		Cuz Hardy was f*ck slow on my system
2008-10-13T21:04:00.000Z	kitche	r0ach	why not ask that in #ubuntu+1
2008-10-13T22:09:00.000Z	kitche	r0ach	from a windows install cd boot into recovery mode and type fixmbr
2008-10-13T22:11:00.000Z	r0ach	kitche	Can you pls explain that procedure ? In my Windows Disk, it tells me to select which drive to install Windows on.
2008-10-13T22:11:00.000Z	kitche	r0ach	you booted past the part where you select to boot into recovery mode
2008-10-13T22:14:00.000Z	kitche	r0ach	well your screwed then
2008-10-13T22:18:00.000Z	kitche	r0ach	well get a real windows xp cd first instead of a hack job to do this
2008-10-13T22:19:00.000Z	r0ach	kitche	You have a point. But my gut tells my that if I can somehow disable GRUB, then I can use ms-sys to get MBR back. How do I get rid of GRUB ?
2008-10-13T22:30:00.000Z	kitche	r0ach	we told you if you have no recovery option on your instlal cd then you can't do what we told you
