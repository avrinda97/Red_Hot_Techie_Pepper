2009-12-13T04:21:00.000Z	enovativ	EastDallas	what is webmin ?
2009-12-13T04:21:00.000Z	enovativ	EastDallas	is this windows and/or linux
2009-12-13T04:22:00.000Z	EastDallas	enovativ	 I read somewhere that you have to set your ubuntu machines to static IP if you don't have wins server.  Webmin is for linux.
2009-12-13T04:23:00.000Z	EastDallas	enovativ	http://www.webmin.com/
2009-12-13T04:24:00.000Z	EastDallas	enovativ	 All that being said, I still use the IP addresses to mount shares in fstab.
