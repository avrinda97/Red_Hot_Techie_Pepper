2010-09-02T03:47:00.000Z	asdfasdfasdfasdf		if i install kubuntu-desktop would i get the exact same thing as if i downloaded the Kubuntu live cd?
2010-09-02T03:49:00.000Z	asdfasdfasdfasdf		ok
2010-09-02T03:50:00.000Z	asdfasdfasdfasdf		also is there any way to install ubuntu to another partition from my Fedora linux? some sort of Wubi, but for linux?
2010-09-02T03:51:00.000Z	bastidrazor	asdfasdfasdfasdf	if you Fedora uses grub you could boot directly into the ubuntu ISO and install that way.
2010-09-02T03:51:00.000Z	bastidrazor	asdfasdfasdfasdf	if using Lilo i do not know if that is possible.
2010-09-02T03:51:00.000Z	asdfasdfasdfasdf	bastidrazor	it does use grub
2010-09-02T03:52:00.000Z	asdfasdfasdfasdf	bastidrazor	i didnt know you could boot ISOs. is that safe? or is there any small chance of things messing up and my hard drive ending up formatted :D
2010-09-02T03:55:00.000Z	bastidrazor	asdfasdfasdfasdf	the only way the drive would be formatted is if you told the ubuntu installer to format it. the installer is smart enough to give you options of how you want to install. entire disk(not the choice you want), create a partition for Ubuntu(resizing your current partition to create a new).. probably the latter choice, also you have the ability to manually partition
2010-09-02T03:58:00.000Z	asdfasdfasdfasdf	bastidrazor	oh ok and now that we are in the topic of installation i ran Kubuntu live cd in VirtualBox and during installation i was never prompted to where should i want grub to be installed. since i have a boot partition i'd like to install ubuntu's grub into its partition and add manually a line to it in my Fedora's grub installed to my hard drive's mbr.a i was never asked for this choice during installation..
2010-09-02T04:01:00.000Z	bastidrazor	asdfasdfasdfasdf	Vbox is completely different than doing an actual install. in Vbox the entire OS is kept in a single file on the box. when doing a real install you will have the option to put grub where ever you want( the final step during the install process) also you can keep your current grub and add Ubuntu to it. if you so choose.
2010-09-02T04:02:00.000Z	asdfasdfasdfasdf	bastidrazor	so? what the os really see is a working hard drive. when i ran FEdora i had the option and so on.
2010-09-02T04:02:00.000Z	asdfasdfasdfasdf	bastidrazor	the OS beeing held inside host should not know that its beeing run inside a virtual machine.
2010-09-02T04:03:00.000Z	bastidrazor	asdfasdfasdfasdf	if you do a real install, not in a VM, you will see the options for grub, like Jordan_U stated.
2010-09-02T04:05:00.000Z	bastidrazor	asdfasdfasdfasdf	10.04 ubuntu uses grub2, it is very different to grub. please read the !grub2 factoid
2010-09-02T04:08:00.000Z	asdfasdfasdfasdf	bastidrazor	cool does it finally support themes with more quality images?
2010-09-02T04:09:00.000Z	bastidrazor	asdfasdfasdfasdf	best of luck :)
2010-09-02T04:10:00.000Z	asdfasdfasdfasdf	bastidrazor	any idea with the upgrade installer question?
2010-09-02T04:12:00.000Z	bastidrazor	asdfasdfasdfasdf	if you have the chance to use the latest installer, 10.04.1, i would go with the newer.. but that is just my way of thinking.
