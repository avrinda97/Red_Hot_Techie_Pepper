2012-10-26T17:52:00.000Z	nicofs		I can't move my mouse over to my second display after upgrading to 12.10... how can I get that working again? (nVidia)
2012-10-26T17:52:00.000Z	pestilence	nicofs	is the second display using twinview or is it a separate xserver?
2012-10-26T17:52:00.000Z	pestilence	nicofs	regardless, you should be able to sort it out using nvidia-settings
2012-10-26T17:53:00.000Z	nicofs	pestilence	seperate x screen - but the settings don't have a checkbox for use mouse for both screens...
2012-10-26T17:55:00.000Z	pestilence	nicofs	don't know what the answer is.  I use twinview.  Not really sure what it would mean to use the same mouse on two different x servers
2012-10-26T17:56:00.000Z	nicofs	pestilence	it used to be that way: push mouse over the edge of screen one and it appears on screen 2 - now it appears on the other side of the same screen...
2012-10-26T17:59:00.000Z	pestilence	nicofs	try using twinview.  I think that's what you want.
2012-10-26T17:59:00.000Z	nicofs	pestilence	that's not what I want. I have been using seperate x screens happily for a few years now...
2012-10-26T19:51:00.000Z	pestilence		i used to have keyboard shortcuts that made a window take up half the screen on the left, half the screen on the right, and maximize/unmaximize.  Any ideas on how to get that back?
2012-10-26T19:55:00.000Z	nicofs		I can't move my mouse over to my second display after upgrading to 12.10... how can I get that working again? (nVidia, seperate x screen)
2012-10-26T19:56:00.000Z	pestilence	nicofs	remind me why you need separate x servers again?
2012-10-26T19:58:00.000Z	nicofs	pestilence	because of running applications in full-screen-mode simultaneously. and because i want it that way (that alone should be enough).
2012-10-26T19:58:00.000Z	pestilence	nicofs	ah, ok.
2012-10-26T19:58:00.000Z	pestilence	nicofs	did you try having nvidia-settings write a new xorg.conf?
2012-10-26T19:59:00.000Z	nicofs	pestilence	several times...
2012-10-26T20:00:00.000Z	nicofs	pestilence	the screen is on - it looks the way it should, all is there and properly set up - i just can't get any input device to focus it...
2012-10-26T20:00:00.000Z	pestilence	nicofs	that is really weird.  you said the mouse moves periodically instead of moving to the second monitor?
2012-10-26T20:02:00.000Z	nicofs	pestilence	yes, so to speak. i can't move it over the left edge (which is ok. nothing there) and when i move it over the right, it reappears left but should move over to the next screen...
