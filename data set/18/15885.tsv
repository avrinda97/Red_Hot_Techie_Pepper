2005-01-09T11:10:00.000Z	kuckus		hi
2005-01-09T11:11:00.000Z	kuckus		I enabled 128 bit wep encryptiion for my wireless network and would like to reconfigure all the settings using the handy 'wizard' from ubuntu's installer - any way of doing that?
2005-01-09T11:13:00.000Z	Lathiat	kuckus	open the "Network" system configuration item
2005-01-09T11:13:00.000Z	Lathiat	kuckus	under computer
2005-01-09T11:13:00.000Z	kuckus		The installer displayed a command you can use to run it again at later after the installation had finished, does anyone know what is was called?
2005-01-09T11:13:00.000Z	kuckus		just in case I need it in the future - or is that unlikely?
2005-01-09T11:14:00.000Z	kuckus	Lathiat	thanks I'll check that
2005-01-09T11:14:00.000Z	Lathiat	kuckus	that wont reconfigure the network
2005-01-09T11:14:00.000Z	Lathiat	kuckus	but its base-config, and i doub't youll ever need to rerun that
2005-01-09T11:14:00.000Z	Lathiat		well at least hes appreciative :)
2005-01-09T11:14:00.000Z	Lathiat		or she, i guess
2005-01-09T11:16:00.000Z	kuckus	Lathiat	though I'm running windows to get online and have to reboot. ok, if you say so I won't write it down. I'll check out the network configuration and be back when it works (or doesn't... ;) thanks!
2005-01-09T11:17:00.000Z	Lathiat	kuckus	the network config tool will lead you through it
2005-01-09T11:17:00.000Z	Lathiat	kuckus	as long as you knwo how to get to it (computer->system config->network)
2005-01-09T11:17:00.000Z	Lathiat	kuckus	then delete the device, re-add it, choose wireless, etc
2005-01-09T11:17:00.000Z	kuckus		irc with trillian... never thought it was possible. see ya ;)
2005-01-09T11:17:00.000Z	Lathiat		should be able to figure it out, its fairly intuitive, i think :)
2005-01-09T11:18:00.000Z	kuckus	Lathiat	yep, think I'll do fine there =)
