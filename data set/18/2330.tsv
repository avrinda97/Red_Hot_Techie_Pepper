2010-06-14T18:20:00.000Z	wSoge		i somehow messed it up, and now only get grub rescue> on boot
2010-06-14T18:20:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wSoge	Any error message before the rescue prompt?
2010-06-14T18:22:00.000Z	wSoge	Jordan_U	 I somehow destroyed my install of mint, I orignally had a dual booting win7 + winXP and then I installed Mint-linux too, grub took over. It worked fine, until I selected some kind of recovery partition causing grub to mess up. Now I am presented with "error: uknown filesystem." and "grub rescue>", anyone can help me fix it?
2010-06-14T18:24:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wSoge	Can you run boot info script, http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1291280 , and pastebin the output?

2010-06-14T18:55:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wSoge	There are instructions here: http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1291280
2010-06-14T18:58:00.000Z	wSoge	Jordan_U	I got "no such file or directory"
2010-06-14T19:00:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wSoge	In a terminal type "sudo bash ", then drag the script into the terminal window, then press enter to run it.
2010-06-14T19:03:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wSoge	I'm going to need to leave in about 10 minutes.
2010-06-14T19:03:00.000Z	wSoge	Jordan_U	ok then, what should i look for in the results?
2010-06-14T19:05:00.000Z	wSoge	Jordan_U	here is the pastebin, http://pastebin.com/6BL10up3
2010-06-14T19:07:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wSoge	Looks like your partition numbering changed, and /dev/sda7 became /dev/sda6
2010-06-14T19:08:00.000Z	wSoge	Jordan_U	so how would I fix this?
2010-06-14T19:08:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wSoge	http://grub.enbug.org/Grub2LiveCdInstallGuide should get grub working again. Make sure that when you run grub-install you point it to /dev/sda *not* to a partition /dev/sda6 .
2010-06-14T19:10:00.000Z	Jordan_U	wSoge	You need to follow that guide to use grub-install from a liveCD, it won't work without either chrooting as explained in the link I gave or using --root-directory. I recommend chrooting.
