2006-05-18T06:20:00.000Z	amphi	LinuxJones	dist-upgrade can pull in new packages, which upgrade will not
2006-05-18T06:21:00.000Z	LinuxJones	amphi	I know that but the stable release doesn't have major upgrades requiring a dist-upgrade otherwise apt-get upgrade is irrelevent and would be depreciated and removed.
2006-05-18T06:21:00.000Z	amphi	LinuxJones	eg., a new version of mplayer could be 'held back' in an upgrade, because it now depends on a new lib package; dist-upgrade would install the new package and upgrade mplayer
2006-05-18T06:21:00.000Z	amphi	LinuxJones	no, but people use other repos for such as mplayer
2006-05-18T06:21:00.000Z	LinuxJones	amphi	is mplayer in Ubuntu base ?
2006-05-18T06:22:00.000Z	amphi	LinuxJones	nope
2006-05-18T06:22:00.000Z	amphi	LinuxJones	it can't be, because of US legal b0rkage AFAIK
2006-05-18T06:27:00.000Z	amphi	LinuxJones	debian manages ;)
2006-05-18T06:28:00.000Z	LinuxJones	amphi	of course folks in here will help people with Univer/Multiverse software if they can. That's jsut a great community
2006-05-18T06:29:00.000Z	amphi	LinuxJones	I meant Debian, not #debian
2006-05-18T06:30:00.000Z	LinuxJones	amphi	I wouldn't go into #debian ever again, even for a date with Halle Berry :(
2006-05-18T06:31:00.000Z	amphi	LinuxJones	you've felt the love? ;)
2006-05-18T06:33:00.000Z	LinuxJones	amphi	I got into so many arguments with the 10 retards harning out in there like mwilson I wanted to smash someone's head in. It was too frustrating dealing with big egos, tho there are some great people in that channel !!
2006-05-18T06:33:00.000Z	amphi	LinuxJones	ah, mwilson...
2006-05-18T06:33:00.000Z	LinuxJones	amphi	thankfully we pushed him out of here with his trolling :)
2006-05-18T06:34:00.000Z	amphi	LinuxJones	he's banned from #debian AFAIK
2006-05-18T06:34:00.000Z	LinuxJones	amphi	that was due like 4 years ago :D
