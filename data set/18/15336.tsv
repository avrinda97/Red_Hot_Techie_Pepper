2005-04-10T13:29:00.000Z	topyli	FlimFlamMan	we'll see if ooo2 is releasable by free software vendors at all :)
2005-04-10T13:37:00.000Z	topyli	FlimFlamMan	yes, if you have the gnome-support package instlled
2005-04-10T13:37:00.000Z	FlimFlamMan	topyli	does that exist in debian-sarge?
2005-04-10T13:37:00.000Z	topyli	FlimFlamMan	iirc, sid at least has it
2005-04-10T13:40:00.000Z	topyli	FlimFlamMan	it has to work too? some people ;)
2005-04-10T14:43:00.000Z	topyli	FlimFlamMan	you can set it up just like you have debian now. that's what i did
2005-04-10T14:44:00.000Z	topyli	FlimFlamMan	that's why we have unstable. no worries about releases :)
2005-04-10T14:46:00.000Z	topyli	FlimFlamMan	that's how i see it. it's unstable, frozen and debugged from time to time
2005-04-10T14:51:00.000Z	topyli	FlimFlamMan	linux-headers on ubuntu
2005-04-10T14:52:00.000Z	FlimFlamMan	topyli	thanks
2005-04-10T15:30:00.000Z	topyli	FlimFlamMan	might be historical. xscreensaver is not a gnome component
2005-04-24T13:28:00.000Z	topyli	FlimFlamMan	companies will pay good money for support. that's how red hat, hp and novell make money. not software
2005-04-24T13:29:00.000Z	FlimFlamMan	topyli	right, what i'm wondering about specifically is if the repositories will become restricted in any way in the future
2005-04-24T13:30:00.000Z	topyli	FlimFlamMan	that would ruin canonical's business
2005-04-24T13:30:00.000Z	FlimFlamMan	topyli	so that's a "no" ?
2005-04-24T13:31:00.000Z	topyli	FlimFlamMan	yes. companies have hoped for good professional debian support for years. now they have ubuntu
2005-04-24T13:31:00.000Z	topyli	FlimFlamMan	progeny and others have done it too, with varying success
2005-04-24T13:33:00.000Z	topyli	FlimFlamMan	it's a consideration. so far they've concentrated on polisihing debian
