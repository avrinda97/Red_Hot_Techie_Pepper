2011-10-06T11:28:00.000Z	The_Phoenix		Hmm xubuntu is pretty slow on 2.8GHz/256MB.
2011-10-06T11:28:00.000Z	iceroot	The_Phoenix	with that ram use lubuntu instead of xubuntu
2011-10-06T11:29:00.000Z	The_Phoenix	iceroot	network manager?
2011-10-06T11:29:00.000Z	iceroot	The_Phoenix	what?
2011-10-06T11:30:00.000Z	The_Phoenix	iceroot	LXDE doesn't seem to have a good network management GUI.
2011-10-06T11:30:00.000Z	iceroot	The_Phoenix	it has a good one
2011-10-06T11:30:00.000Z	iceroot	The_Phoenix	also you can use nm-applet and network-manager on lubuntu instead of wcid
2011-10-06T11:31:00.000Z	The_Phoenix	iceroot	I tried. Not working.
2011-10-06T11:31:00.000Z	iceroot	The_Phoenix	its working here
2011-10-06T11:31:00.000Z	iceroot	The_Phoenix	so "doesnt work" is a bad description
2011-10-06T11:31:00.000Z	The_Phoenix	iceroot	do I have to install any addtional packages?
2011-10-06T11:32:00.000Z	iceroot	The_Phoenix	sudo apt-get install nm-applet
2011-10-06T11:32:00.000Z	iceroot	The_Phoenix	thats all
2011-10-06T11:32:00.000Z	The_Phoenix	iceroot	I have nm-applet working on xfce. Do I have to install nm applet after I install lxde?
2011-10-06T11:33:00.000Z	iceroot	The_Phoenix	yes
2011-10-06T11:33:00.000Z	The_Phoenix	iceroot	so, that was my mistake. will try again. =D
2011-10-06T11:34:00.000Z	iceroot	The_Phoenix	if i am correct "lubuntu-desktop" will remove nm-applet and install wcid
2011-10-06T11:34:00.000Z	iceroot	The_Phoenix	so nm-applet have to be installed after
