2010-05-09T06:22:00.000Z	wulfgar|laptop		hi, i have ubuntu running on a headless box .. for some reason i cannot telnet to port 8080 .. i'm trying to disable iptables temporarily but the general service iptables stop or /etc/init.d/iptables stop is returning no service .. any ideas ? iptables -L shows the rules in place ..
2010-05-09T06:23:00.000Z	th0r	wulfgar|laptop	I don't think you can stop iptables, you need to flush the rules
2010-05-09T06:23:00.000Z	wulfgar|laptop	th0r	sorry, im used to other distro's which allow me to stop iptables - how to flush rules ?
2010-05-09T06:24:00.000Z	th0r	wulfgar|laptop	it has been a while since I played with iptables, but I think you just do an iptables -f. I am on a windows netbook right now so can't check
2010-05-09T06:25:00.000Z	wulfgar|laptop	th0r	i did the following: iptables -F iptables -X iptables -t nat -F iptables -t nat -X iptables -t mangle -F iptables -t mangle -X iptables -P INPUT ACCEPT iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT
2010-05-09T06:25:00.000Z	th0r	wulfgar|laptop	I always kept a text file with my iptables rules. I told iptables to read it when I wanted iptables workign, then flushed the rules to sort of 'turn it off'
2010-05-09T06:25:00.000Z	wulfgar|laptop	th0r	ill test it now
2010-05-09T06:25:00.000Z	th0r	wulfgar|laptop	how about 'man iptables'? Wouldn't that be easier
2010-05-09T06:25:00.000Z	wulfgar|laptop	th0r	lol yes
2010-05-09T06:25:00.000Z	wulfgar|laptop	th0r	sorry to bother
2010-05-09T06:26:00.000Z	wulfgar|laptop	th0r	i still cant telnet to 8080 .. i can telnet to 80, 22, etc. .. any ideas ?
2010-05-09T06:27:00.000Z	th0r	wulfgar|laptop	what is on 8080?
2010-05-09T06:32:00.000Z	wulfgar|laptop	th0r	the apex front-end for oracle-xe
2010-05-09T06:32:00.000Z	th0r	wulfgar|laptop	is it a web interface? try pointing the browser to 8080
2010-05-09T06:33:00.000Z	wulfgar|laptop	th0r	yes ive tried this, times out .. service is running though
2010-05-09T06:33:00.000Z	wulfgar|laptop	th0r	cant telnet to the port though .. so i'd assume this is the problem
2010-05-09T06:35:00.000Z	th0r	wulfgar|laptop	the only other thought I have is that the service might not be config'ed for 8080 by default. Not likely, but the only other thing I can think of off hand
2010-05-09T06:35:00.000Z	wulfgar|laptop	th0r	thanks for your help !
