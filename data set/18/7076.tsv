2010-10-15T02:19:00.000Z	AHemlocksLie		I'm trying to install ndiswrapper, and I'm trying to compile from source. The install file says when I run ls /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build, I need to see .config and include, but I don't have .config. How can I get it?
2010-10-15T02:20:00.000Z	phisher1	AHemlocksLie	you might need kernel source.. is that default in ubuntu ?
2010-10-15T02:21:00.000Z	AHemlocksLie	phisher1	I have no idea, where would I find it?
2010-10-15T02:22:00.000Z	phisher1	AHemlocksLie	are you booted to your currently installed kernel?
2010-10-15T02:23:00.000Z	AHemlocksLie	phisher1	yeah, I'm in Ubuntu 10.10 right now, haven't done anything special, just a regular boot
2010-10-15T02:25:00.000Z	phisher1	AHemlocksLie	click on the little power button
2010-10-15T02:25:00.000Z	phisher1	AHemlocksLie	does it say restart to install updates?
2010-10-15T02:25:00.000Z	AHemlocksLie	phisher1	nope, just regular restart
2010-10-15T02:26:00.000Z	phisher1	AHemlocksLie	you do have build-essentials installed right?
2010-10-15T02:26:00.000Z	AHemlocksLie	phisher1	I believe so, I'll try again just in case. sudo apt-get install build-essentials?
2010-10-15T02:26:00.000Z	AHemlocksLie	phisher1	already newest version
2010-10-15T02:28:00.000Z	AHemlocksLie	phisher1	is .config supposed to be part of build-essentials or something?
2010-10-15T02:28:00.000Z	phisher1	AHemlocksLie	i'm guessing you can't use the version in repos?
2010-10-15T02:28:00.000Z	phisher1	AHemlocksLie	no.. i'm not sure what actually puts .config there
2010-10-15T02:28:00.000Z	AHemlocksLie	phisher1	of ndiswrapper? nope, I was trying to use ndisgtk, but that's giving me errors finding the ndiswrapper module
2010-10-15T02:29:00.000Z	AHemlocksLie	phisher1	so I'm trying to install ndiswrapper from source, which involved tracking down a patch to make it compatible with kernel 2.6.35, so it compiles okay, but still doesn't fix the problem, so I'm guessing I need .config
2010-10-15T02:30:00.000Z	phisher1	AHemlocksLie	not sure man
2010-10-15T02:31:00.000Z	AHemlocksLie	phisher1	crap, thanks for trying, then
