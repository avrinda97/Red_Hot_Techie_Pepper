2006-09-02T13:16:00.000Z	ryedunn		why does GRUB say my root partition is in /dev/hda5 when it looks like its in /media/hda5  (either way I cant get it to boot)
2006-09-02T13:18:00.000Z	ryedunn		Chaos okay.. any idea why it might be hanging and erroring out with a ""ALERT! /dev/hda5 does not exits. Dropping to a shell!""
2006-09-02T13:18:00.000Z	ChaosFan	ryedunn	maybe /dev/hda5 does not exist. how many partitions do you have?
2006-09-02T13:17:00.000Z	ChaosFan	ryedunn	/media/hda5 is a mount point, /dev/hda5 is a device file
2006-09-02T13:19:00.000Z	ChaosFan	ryedunn	and your root partition is the last one??
2006-09-02T13:20:00.000Z	ChaosFan	ryedunn	then try to boot /dev/hda2
2006-09-02T13:22:00.000Z	ChaosFan	ryedunn	use a pastebin ;0
2006-09-02T13:27:00.000Z	ChaosFan	ryedunn	i think you need to boot /dev/hda1 and add real_root=/dev/hda2 as an option to your kernel
2006-09-02T13:30:00.000Z	ChaosFan	ryedunn	than try all with hde instead of hda
2006-09-02T13:30:00.000Z	ChaosFan	ryedunn	you are using grub?
2006-09-02T13:31:00.000Z	ChaosFan	ryedunn	any other hard drives in your system?
2006-09-02T13:33:00.000Z	ChaosFan	ryedunn	that for sure sounds curious
2006-09-02T13:34:00.000Z	ChaosFan	ryedunn	what exactly is written in your menu.lst for the item you want to boot?
2006-09-02T13:35:00.000Z	ChaosFan	ryedunn	/boot/grub/menu.lst
2006-09-02T13:36:00.000Z	ChaosFan	ryedunn	it also shows ub when you hit "e" while hilighting the entry you want to boot in grub's boot menu
2006-09-02T13:39:00.000Z	ChaosFan	ryedunn	try real_root=/dev/hde5 instead of root=dev/hda5
2006-09-02T13:41:00.000Z	ChaosFan	ryedunn	i think your /etc/fstab is wrong
2006-09-02T13:42:00.000Z	ChaosFan	ryedunn	try booting a livecd and mounting your root device and so on, then edit /etc/fstab there
