2006-05-01T14:09:00.000Z	_jim_		hey guys , yesterday i mounted 2 partitions - today i turned on the pc and they are gone ....... any help ?
2006-05-01T14:10:00.000Z	DBO	_jim_	did you add them to /etc/fstab?
2006-05-01T14:10:00.000Z	DBO	_jim_	you have to use "sudo gedit /etc/fstab" to edit it
2006-05-01T14:22:00.000Z	DBO	_jim_	what are you trying to do again?
2006-05-01T14:23:00.000Z	DBO	_jim_	what are you trying to mount, and where do you want to mount it?
2006-05-01T14:24:00.000Z	DBO	_jim_	step by step instructions -> https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AutomaticallyMountMSWindowsPartitions
2006-05-01T14:30:00.000Z	DBO	_jim_	what is the filename?
2006-05-01T14:42:00.000Z	DBO	_jim_	you have to set the uid=1000 option while mounting so you own it persay
2006-05-01T14:43:00.000Z	DBO	_jim_	I dont know how you mounted it, but if you used the fstab, yes, you have to edit that
2006-05-01T14:50:00.000Z	DBO	_jim_	like apt-get?
2006-05-01T14:50:00.000Z	DBO	_jim_	like synaptics?
2006-05-01T14:51:00.000Z	DBO	_jim_	o rly?  well then, what happens when you click it?
2006-05-01T14:52:00.000Z	DBO	_jim_	no, you type YOUR password
2006-05-01T14:53:00.000Z	DBO	_jim_	in terminal "ps -ef | grep synaptic | wc -l"
2006-05-01T14:54:00.000Z	DBO	_jim_	ok, what I thought...
2006-05-01T14:55:00.000Z	_jim_	DBO	, so ? whats wrong ?
2006-05-01T14:56:00.000Z	DBO	_jim_	no idea, we will need to troubleshoot more, but right now I do know something is SNAFU
