2007-08-13T12:04:00.000Z	afd__		hi! I have an upgrade (edgy > feisty) that fell midway through. Is there a rescue disk or something, to complete the install? The installer, as far as I remember, wants a clean disk and wouldn't use the config files already present on my system
2007-08-13T12:05:00.000Z	Falstius	afd__	can you no longer boot the system?  If you can fix the reason the upgrade failed, just run the upgrade again.
2007-08-13T12:06:00.000Z	afd__	Falstius	It complained something about udev not being installed... and so I probably won't be able to boot the system
2007-08-13T12:06:00.000Z	afd__		I'll try, though
2007-08-13T12:07:00.000Z	Falstius	afd__	the other alternative that has worked for me in the past is to boot with a live CD, chroot to the installed system and then continue the upgrade
2007-08-13T12:08:00.000Z	afd__	Falstius	I remember a bit about chroot... if the apt-get binary isn't working, is there a static built one?
2007-08-13T12:08:00.000Z	afd__		or aptitude...
2007-08-13T12:09:00.000Z	Falstius	afd__	it should be working.  you'd probably have to build your own to get a statically linked one.
2007-08-13T12:09:00.000Z	afd__	Falstius	ok, thanks for the advice :)
2007-08-13T12:43:00.000Z	afd__	Falstius	regarding my problem with the broken upgrade:it booted using the old edgy kernel and now I'm running a dkpg-configure -a (as recommended by aptitude dist-upgrade). One question:
2007-08-13T12:44:00.000Z	Falstius	afd__	what?
2007-08-13T12:44:00.000Z	afd__	Falstius	when I've started the upgrade, it asked me as part of the install procedure about lvm and raid stuff. I said none, cause I don't have any, but it might have broken the disk setup, how they are mounted
2007-08-13T12:45:00.000Z	afd__		I'm thinking that maybe that's why it broke (there were errors about disk not mounted, midway through upgrade)
2007-08-13T12:45:00.000Z	afd__		dpkg-reconfigure lvm?
2007-08-13T12:45:00.000Z	Falstius	afd__	if you don't have lvm and raid it shouldn't matter ..
2007-08-13T12:46:00.000Z	afd__	Falstius	I didn't configure the old system using LVM, just used the Ubuntu defaults, not sure if it doesn't use LVM
2007-08-13T12:46:00.000Z	Falstius	afd__	It doesn't use LVM unless you tell it do.  If the error occurs again, you should do a google search for the exact error message.
2007-08-13T12:47:00.000Z	afd__	Falstius	ok, thanks for the advice
