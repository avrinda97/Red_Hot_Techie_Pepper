2006-12-24T08:40:00.000Z	alecjw		does anyone know what the fastest window manager is?
2006-12-24T08:42:00.000Z	alecjw		*fluxbox
2006-12-24T08:43:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	alecjw	use an older kernel and strip as much as you can
2006-12-24T08:43:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	alecjw	fluxbox/icewm should be fine
2006-12-24T08:44:00.000Z	alecjw	nolimitsoya	is there an ubuntu which uses the 2.4 kernel?
2006-12-24T08:44:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	alecjw	nope
2006-12-24T08:44:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	alecjw	i wouldnt suggest using ubuntu at all, for those specs...
2006-12-24T08:45:00.000Z	alecjw	nolimitsoya	currently, it's ruinning cubuntu
2006-12-24T08:46:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	alecjw	youll just get bogged down trying to run anything graphical on top of something as heavy as ubuntu, sorry
2006-12-24T08:49:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	alecjw	have you tried a minimal install and then just apt-geting the wm?
2006-12-24T08:51:00.000Z	alecjw	nolimitsoya	yep. it was very sluggish
2006-12-24T08:51:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	alecjw	thats what i thought. as i said, try out a less bloated distro. perhaps get into gentoo?
2006-12-24T08:52:00.000Z	alecjw	nolimitsoya	debian maybe? might htat work?
2006-12-24T08:52:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	alecjw	ubntu is based on debian
2006-12-24T08:52:00.000Z	alecjw	nolimitsoya	yeah. i know, but i've heard that it's leass bloated
2006-12-24T08:53:00.000Z	nolimitsoya	alecjw	you could try, but i dont think its worth your time. they are both designed for modern hw. try a custom gentoo (as if there was another :P ) with a lightweight kernel
2006-12-24T08:53:00.000Z	alecjw	nolimitsoya	ok. thanks
