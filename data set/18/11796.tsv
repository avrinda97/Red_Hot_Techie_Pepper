2006-07-01T15:04:00.000Z	wooby		when attempting to build an amd64 .deb of wine, i get this error: checking for C compiler default output file name... configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables
2006-07-01T15:04:00.000Z	bbrazil	wooby	aptitude install build-essential
2006-07-01T15:05:00.000Z	wooby	bbrazil	they're up to date, still same error though :(
2006-07-01T15:05:00.000Z	bbrazil	wooby	are you on solaris by any chance :)
2006-07-01T15:05:00.000Z	wooby	bbrazil	na
2006-07-01T15:05:00.000Z	bbrazil	wooby	you're running this off amd64?
2006-07-01T15:05:00.000Z	wooby	bbrazil	correct
2006-07-01T15:06:00.000Z	wooby	bbrazil	6.06
2006-07-01T15:08:00.000Z	bbrazil	wooby	does gcc work for a quick hello world?
2006-07-01T15:08:00.000Z	wooby	bbrazil	yeah
2006-07-01T15:09:00.000Z	wooby	bbrazil	checking out the config.log, it seems to be skipping a bunch of libs on account of "incompatible"
2006-07-01T15:09:00.000Z	bbrazil	wooby	I suggest digging into the ./configure and seeing what test it's running
2006-07-01T15:09:00.000Z	wooby	bbrazil	so it can't find a working -lc
2006-07-01T15:09:00.000Z	bbrazil	wooby	maybe it doesn't like amd64?
2006-07-01T15:09:00.000Z	wooby	bbrazil	it definitely does not lol
2006-07-01T15:10:00.000Z	wooby	bbrazil	any idea where i might be able to get a built 64 bit deb for this, some unnoficial repository?
2006-07-01T15:10:00.000Z	bbrazil	wooby	google it i'd say - or check the wiki
2006-07-01T15:10:00.000Z	wooby	bbrazil	ok thanks anyway
