2009-04-04T22:11:00.000Z	Artelus		Hi, can someone help me fix my time and date? I did something to mess it up when I first started using Ubuntu and now i'm paying the price for it.
2009-04-04T22:12:00.000Z	Artelus		Hello...?
2009-04-04T22:12:00.000Z	Artelus		Can anyone help me?
2009-04-04T22:12:00.000Z	Artelus		I just did, but noone said anything
2009-04-04T22:13:00.000Z	Artelus		I'll repeat it
2009-04-04T22:14:00.000Z	darkvertex	Artelus	see that /etc/timezone points to your correct location
2009-04-04T22:19:00.000Z	Artelus	darkvertex	Alright, now what?
2009-04-04T22:15:00.000Z	Artelus	darkvertex	Can you show me how to do that on the terminal?
2009-04-04T22:16:00.000Z	darkvertex	Artelus	what does cat /etc/timezone says?
2009-04-04T22:16:00.000Z	Artelus	darkvertex	I set it to America/Mexico_City, which should be -6, i think
2009-04-04T22:17:00.000Z	darkvertex	Artelus	does it point to your location? if it is then your computer should show the correct time
2009-04-04T22:18:00.000Z	Artelus	darkvertex	Yeah, it points to my location, but my computer is showing the wrong time
2009-04-04T22:21:00.000Z	darkvertex	Artelus	I'm sure the ntpdate function in /etc/network/if-up.d should take care of your time setup while ubuntu boots
2009-04-04T22:21:00.000Z	Artelus	darkvertex	I don't understand what that is
2009-04-04T22:23:00.000Z	darkvertex	Artelus	everytime ubuntu starts, ntpdate shell script got executed to connect your computer to an ntp server, to synchronize your computer's cleck setting
2009-04-04T22:33:00.000Z	darkvertex	Artelus	edit /etc/default/ntpdate to include NTPSERVERS=""ntp.ubuntu.com pool.ntp.org"
2009-04-04T22:34:00.000Z	Artelus	darkvertex	Do I cahnge NTPSERVERS="ntp.ubuntu.com" to NTPSERVERS="ntp.ubuntu.com pool.ntp.org"
2009-04-04T22:35:00.000Z	darkvertex	Artelus	yes
